00:01.235 --> 00:03.571
You're facing your fears
with The Exorcist.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.174
-Unclean spirit!
-In the name of God!

00:06.207 --> 00:07.908
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.543
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.577 --> 00:12.146
The Gifted, Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.382
I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.088
-Previously on The Exorcist...
-I thought it'd be nice

00:20.121 --> 00:21.589
if you'd come down to dinner
tonight and join us.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.257
You could wear your brave face.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.726
-What the hell are you doing?
-Asking God for help.

00:25.759 --> 00:26.994
You had to come here?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.862
Andy, whatever's going on
on this island,

00:28.896 --> 00:30.064
this is where it's strongest.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.203
ROSE: I don't think that
you are able to see clearly.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.870
Is it possible

00:36.904 --> 00:38.872
that maybe you
are not the best judge

00:38.906 --> 00:42.776
spotting warning signs
of depression and self-harm?

00:42.810 --> 00:45.113
We believe there's something
dangerous at work here,

00:45.146 --> 00:48.249
a demon-- one that targets
families and coerces parents

00:48.282 --> 00:50.951
into murdering
their own children.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.220
Why would she bring them here?

00:52.253 --> 00:53.687
NICOLE:
She wants them to tear us apart.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.224
-What should I do?
-Protect this family.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.458
An old rock.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.892
What's its significance?

00:58.926 --> 01:00.528
Do you blame yourself
for your wife's death?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.463
Why do you keep asking me
these questions?

01:02.496 --> 01:03.964
I want you out of my house.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.299
I'm not going with you.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.135
Mom?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.537
-Get your damn hands off her!
-Get back! -Marcus!

01:09.570 --> 01:11.305
TOMAS:
Behold the cross of the Lord!

01:11.339 --> 01:12.940
Flee bands of enemies!

01:12.973 --> 01:14.342
-From the snares of the Devil...
-(thunder crashes)

01:15.776 --> 01:17.778
(birds chirping)

01:19.680 --> 01:21.682
NICOLE:
Andy.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.490

01:31.925 --> 01:33.527
(groans softly)

01:36.964 --> 01:39.433
(long inhale)

01:39.467 --> 01:41.202
(exhales)

02:14.235 --> 02:15.736
Nikki?

02:22.910 --> 02:24.812
(pouring liquid)

02:33.721 --> 02:35.423
-What does it mean?
-(coffee spills)

02:36.490 --> 02:38.792
Hey, Truck.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.528
What does what mean, buddy?

02:40.561 --> 02:42.396
"Don't forget that

02:42.430 --> 02:44.898
-I will always love you"?
-You're supposed to read these

02:44.932 --> 02:46.867
at lunch, Truck-- that's why
she puts them in your lunch.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.736
But I don't get it.

02:48.769 --> 02:52.740
"Don't forget I will always
love you"? Why would I forget?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.309
She's your mom, Truck.
She loves you. That's all.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.445
All right, get to school.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.421
Verity, you take
my earbuds again?

03:07.455 --> 03:10.190
VERITY:
Yeah, how about no?

03:10.224 --> 03:13.093
ANDY:
Try your hoodie, left pocket.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.829
Got 'em?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.898
-Yep.
-All right.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.402
Nikki?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.039
(door closes)

03:28.376 --> 03:29.910
Nikki?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.421
Nikki?

03:51.265 --> 03:52.766
Nikki?

03:55.303 --> 03:57.305
*

04:10.484 --> 04:12.686
Nikki?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.533
Nikki!

04:27.200 --> 04:30.037
(panting)

04:31.672 --> 04:33.807
Nikki!

04:42.716 --> 04:44.618
Nikki!

04:57.197 --> 04:59.533
Nikki! Nikki!

05:02.503 --> 05:04.872
(indistinct police radio
transmission, siren wailing)

05:08.075 --> 05:10.077
(indistinct chatter)

05:14.314 --> 05:16.149
I don't understand.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.222
She ever say anything or...

05:25.659 --> 05:27.561
No.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.763
Nothing.

05:31.365 --> 05:35.536
"Don't forget,
I will always... love you."

05:35.569 --> 05:36.770
OFFICER:
Everyone, step back.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.808
-OFFICER: Put her down. -Hey,
Andy, let's-let's get you home

05:40.841 --> 05:42.376
in some dry clothes, all right?

05:42.410 --> 05:44.177
Wait, don't look at her
like this, Andy.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.579
You don't want to remember her

05:45.613 --> 05:47.515
-like this, Andy.
-Hold on, hold on.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.549
(Andy grunts)

05:50.551 --> 05:52.386
Oh, my God.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.027
(whispering):
Oh, baby.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.830
Oh, Nikki.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.533
-Oh, Nikki.
-Andy, come on.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.734
Andy.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.068
-I can't.
-Come on, Andy. Come on.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.937
Come on, Andy. Come on.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.539
-Come on.
-Nikki.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.574
(anguished cry)

06:14.808 --> 06:16.309
(distorted, echoing):
Nikki!

06:17.478 --> 06:19.480
Nikki!

The power of Christ...!

*

07:51.004 --> 07:53.206
SHELBY: Truck, a-a taco is not
a sandwich, okay?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.375
TRUCK: I said they're part
of the same family.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.810
-There's no sandwich family.
-SHELBY: Exactly.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.045
-Yes, there is. -This is the
stupidest argument of all time.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.113
-Okay, what about a burrito?
-N-No...

08:00.147 --> 08:01.715
-Okay, here we go.
-(talking over each other)

08:01.749 --> 08:02.716
Okay, be decent,

08:02.750 --> 08:03.951
for the Muggles. Okay?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.053
ANDY: Three in a row,
three in a row.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.454
NICOLE:
Smile.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.558
Verity! I saw that.
Please smile.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.659
-All right.
-(camera beeps)

08:11.692 --> 08:13.326
NICOLE:
Okay, silly one.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.663
-ANDY: Silly one. Silly one.
-(Nicole screams)

08:15.696 --> 08:18.365
-Ew. Gross.
-Get a room.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.033
-(laughing)
-TOMAS: ...have mercy on us.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.401
MARCUS: God the Son,
Redeemer of the world...

-TOMAS: Have mercy on us.
-God the Father in Heaven...

08:23.103 --> 08:24.071
TOMAS:
Have mercy on us.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.739
God the Son,
Redeemer of the World...

08:25.773 --> 08:27.675
-TOMAS: Have mercy on us.
-God the Father in Heaven...

08:27.708 --> 08:29.142
TOMAS:
Have mercy on us.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.177
God, the Son,
Redeemer of the World...

08:30.210 --> 08:32.546
-Have mercy on us.
-(grunts)

08:32.580 --> 08:34.582
Get me out of here.
(grunts)

08:36.617 --> 08:38.218
Let me go.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.789
The kids.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.425
-Where are the kids?
-They are safe, Andy.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.761
You will be, too, soon.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.396
(sighs)

08:49.429 --> 08:50.964
I tried.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.767
I couldn't stop her.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.936
Who, Andy?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.471
Nikki... Nikki...

08:59.907 --> 09:01.775
Nikki. I tried to save her.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.712
-Listen to me, Andy.
-(growling)

09:04.745 --> 09:07.080
This thing is not a wife.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.882
That woman that you loved
is gone.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.518
What you see now is a parasite,
feeding off your pain and anger.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.953
(Andy groans)

09:12.986 --> 09:15.122
It wants you to do
terrible things, Andy.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.125
But first of all,
it needs your obedience.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.160
(gasping, guttural grunting)

09:23.330 --> 09:25.866
(strained grunting)

09:25.899 --> 09:28.568
Tell me more about her, Andy.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.504
The thing that looks like Nikki.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.209
When did she come to you
for the first time?

09:36.243 --> 09:38.646
(grunting)

09:38.679 --> 09:41.281
Think hard.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.652
It will try to hide
this memory from you.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.487
Find it.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.489
(groans softly)

09:49.522 --> 09:51.058
(gasps)

09:51.091 --> 09:53.827
ANDY (brushing teeth):
I say screw it.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.163
Social Services is working you
to the bone.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.265
Let's play hooky,
drive over to Yakima,

09:58.298 --> 10:00.768
drink some local wine
till we talk funny.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.473
What is it?

10:06.506 --> 10:08.776
(sighs)

10:08.809 --> 10:11.812
So, there's this girl...

10:11.845 --> 10:14.014
I haven't been able
to place her.

10:14.047 --> 10:18.151
She's been through some stuff,
it'd make your hair turn white.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.353
But, God, she's amazing.

10:20.387 --> 10:24.357
She's smart--
she's scary smart,

10:24.391 --> 10:28.095
and she's ballsy as hell.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.997
She sounds familiar.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.434
(exhales)

10:34.467 --> 10:36.704
I want to bring her here.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.840
Wow.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.511
I think she needs us, Andy.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.517
And I think I need her, too.

10:52.853 --> 10:56.023
Well, this is, uh...

10:56.056 --> 10:58.491
it's a big step.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.362
I know.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.102
What do you think?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.307
I think you're incredible.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.409
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.248
(both laugh)

11:28.255 --> 11:30.557
Does this miracle kid
have a name?

11:30.590 --> 11:33.026
Verity.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.163
SHELBY: "Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord

11:36.196 --> 11:38.131
that they may rest
from their labours."

11:40.200 --> 11:42.202
Amen.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.210
(Truck sniffles)

12:12.665 --> 12:14.167
I-I can do it.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.755
VERITY:
No, stop.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.891
That's not how you do it.
You're...

12:37.925 --> 12:41.962
you're... you're supposed
to scatter them.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.297
I-I did.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.934
You just dumped the whole thing.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.969
What did he do?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.737
He put Mom in the garden.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.540
Andy, I-I'm sorry.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.911
There's no right way.

12:57.945 --> 13:01.148
There's no right way.
You guys did a great job.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.016
Now, all of you, come here.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.751
Come here.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.619
Verity. Ver... Verity.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.788
-Come here. No. Come here.
-Get off.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.291
-Get off of me.
-It's all right, it's all right.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.426
-It's all right.
-(Verity sobbing)

13:13.460 --> 13:15.462
I know.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.067
Love you, Mom.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.537
-Saint Euphemia.
-TOMAS: Pray for us.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.239
-MARCUS: Saint Lucy.
-Pray for us.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.910
Marcus.

13:31.578 --> 13:35.148
Andy. Andy, listen to my voice.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.518
Can you hear me?

13:38.551 --> 13:40.353
Andy, there's something
inside you.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.755
You can feel it, can't you?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.461
(gasps)

13:48.495 --> 13:49.696
It's cold.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.631
Yes.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.402
And it's got its filthy hands
wrapped around your memories.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.337
It lies, Andy.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.672
It twists.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.909
You don't have to do this alone.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.243
Let us help.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.512
I can't.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.381
-It's too strong.
-MARCUS: No, no, no.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.716
It just wants you
to feel like that,

14:09.749 --> 14:11.384
'cause that's what miserable

14:11.418 --> 14:13.353
little pissant
schoolyard bullies do.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.855
They make you feel
weak and small.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.858
But you've fought monsters
before, I know you have.

14:18.892 --> 14:22.762
Every single day you're out
there, fighting for those kids.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.498
Keep fighting.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.068
Tell us how it first
came to you.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.439
Please, keep looking.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.775
We can unravel its work, but we
have to know where to start.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.679
TOMAS:
Andy, stay with me.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.414
Listen to my voice.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.119
Andy, listen to my voice.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.392
Hey.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.961
What are you doing?

14:53.994 --> 14:55.195
Truck's baseball uniform

14:55.228 --> 14:57.264
was getting seriously rank.

14:57.297 --> 15:01.068
I figured you could use some
fresh sheets while I was at it.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.882
We're almost out of detergent,

15:15.915 --> 15:19.219
but I can make a run
after class.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.587
If you want.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.790
Yeah. Thanks, V.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.359
Thank you.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.270
Did she say anything?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.040
Before?

15:41.308 --> 15:42.976
Not to me, no.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.946
It's so stupid;
she wasn't even sad.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.949
It's not about being sad, kiddo.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.187
Depression's a disease.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.189
And when you don't ask
for help...

15:56.223 --> 15:58.025
Yeah? And what if she was asking
this whole time,

15:58.058 --> 15:59.792
and no one was listening?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.830
MARCUS:
Andy. Andy.

16:03.863 --> 16:07.034
The first time it came to you,
what form did it take?

16:08.335 --> 16:11.871
Remember. Remember.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.174
Remember.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.209
(sobbing)

16:29.322 --> 16:31.691
GRACE:
It's okay, Andy.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.531
Who are you?

16:38.565 --> 16:40.567
I'm Grace.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.071
Hi, Grace.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.073
I'm Andy.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.708
I know, silly.

16:48.741 --> 16:52.579
Why are you sad?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.947
I lost my friend.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.118
I could be your friend.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.068
(low snarling)

17:17.404 --> 17:19.406
What's that you got there?

17:19.439 --> 17:21.141
My mask.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.444
I get scared sometimes.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.379
I don't like going outside.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.918
Is that right?

17:31.951 --> 17:33.586
Can you help me, Andy?

17:34.621 --> 17:36.623
I can try.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.859
Maybe I can help you, too.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.429
I'd like that.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.465
MARCUS:
Fight it, Andy.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.667
You have to fight it.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.104
Wait, Grace.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.772
Grace. Grace.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.477
Grace?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.681
Grace?

18:03.850 --> 18:06.519
Grace?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.663
Boo.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.968
Nikki.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.005
Hey, you.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.811
My Andy-bear.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.014
What have they done to you?

18:39.619 --> 18:42.489
I don't know what's happening.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.524
Nikki, I think
I'm losing my mind.

18:44.557 --> 18:48.295
They're trying
to break us apart.

18:50.797 --> 18:55.335
But we aren't going
to let them... are we?

18:55.368 --> 18:58.505
-Andy. Andy, stay with us.
-(Andy gasping)

18:58.538 --> 19:00.106
Andy, fight back.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.243
For your children.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.080
Fight back, Andy.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.818
No, we're not.

19:21.428 --> 19:24.163
-(low snarling)
-TOMAS: Be patient, Rose.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.299
You have to trust us
to help him.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.702
ROSE: There is a dead body
in the next room.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.171
How are we supposed
to explain that?

19:32.205 --> 19:33.706
Because I'm guessing
"killed by a demon"

19:33.740 --> 19:35.174
isn't going to fly

19:35.208 --> 19:36.476
when the cops show up.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.044
We finish the exorcism,

19:38.077 --> 19:39.679
then we deal
with the consequences.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.715
We stop now, Andy dies.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.385
If we take him to hospital,
other people die.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.754
We're close, Rose.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.429
Can he hear us?

19:57.964 --> 19:59.532
Not likely.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.572
The kids, how are they doing?

20:05.605 --> 20:07.440
They watched their father
murder someone.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.075
How do you think they're doing?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.712
I'll give you as much time
as I can,

20:12.745 --> 20:14.714
but I can't keep them
on the island forever.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.683
These kids are monitored
by the state.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.552
They go missing for too long,
someone's gonna come looking.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.288
Then we have to work faster.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.729
(low growling)

20:29.762 --> 20:31.998
(low, guttural growl)

20:37.169 --> 20:39.639
(groans)

20:43.009 --> 20:44.577
(Marcus prays indistinctly)

20:44.611 --> 20:46.846
Don't look at them.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.317
Look at me.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.152
Come back to me.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.990
You look weird.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.160
-What? You're weird.
-(Nicole laughs)

21:01.193 --> 21:02.929
How'd I get so lucky?

21:02.962 --> 21:04.964
It's not luck when you get
what you deserve.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.199
(Nicole sighs)

21:09.369 --> 21:11.338
And you do deserve this.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.506
You have worked so hard.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.442
It's okay to be
a little selfish.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.681
Enjoy the win.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.852
Where are the kids?

21:25.885 --> 21:28.788
(sighs) I think
I saw them in the garden.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.360
I should check on them.

21:33.393 --> 21:37.330
Or... we could do other things.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.165
What kind of things?

21:39.198 --> 21:42.369
Hmm. Terrible things.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.136
(Andy chuckles)

21:44.170 --> 21:46.806
-(both laughing)
-Terrible...

21:46.839 --> 21:48.675
(demonic laughter)

21:48.708 --> 21:51.243
(yelling)

21:52.545 --> 21:54.881
-Andy. Stay with us.
-(Andy groans)

21:54.914 --> 21:56.949
You have to stay with us, Andy!

21:56.983 --> 21:59.118
Stay with us, stay with us.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.487
-(Tomas speaking gibberish)
-You have to fight this.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.121
To fight it. That's it.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.723
-(yelling)
-You have to stay with us, Andy!

22:03.756 --> 22:05.191
Focus on my voice.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.494
What you're seeing,
it is a demon.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.328
One that targets families,
children.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.798
It will try to turn you against
them, make you harm them.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.733
MARCUS: The demon will
harvest your memories, it will

22:13.766 --> 22:16.569
corrupt them. Whatever it's
showing you-- it is not real.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.706
What you're seeing, it is not

22:19.739 --> 22:21.708
-your wife.
-(both laughing)

22:21.741 --> 22:24.276
Uh-uh. No peeking.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.647
-Ready?
-Yes.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.082
(Andy laughs)

22:30.116 --> 22:31.851
What do you think?

22:31.884 --> 22:35.555
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.060
I can't believe
you did all this. Ah!

22:41.093 --> 22:42.829
Just like you always wanted.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.131
Do you like it?

22:46.399 --> 22:48.768
-(sighs)
-It's perfect.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.073
How did we afford all this?

22:54.106 --> 22:56.543
NICOLE:
Well, how do you think?

22:57.777 --> 22:59.245
(Nicole laughs)

22:59.278 --> 23:00.680
Where are the boys?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.181
They're in the garden.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.716
Oh, let me show you my studio.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.718
Come, come.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.120
Come on.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.024
Ta-da!

23:12.058 --> 23:14.794
Where's Verity?

23:14.827 --> 23:17.263
It's everything
we've ever wanted.

23:17.296 --> 23:19.098
Do you like it?

23:19.131 --> 23:20.933
Where's Verity's stuff?
Where's Harper?

23:20.967 --> 23:22.535
Andy.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.471
Verity? Boys?

23:24.504 --> 23:25.905
-(Nicole sighs)
-Where are they?

23:25.938 --> 23:27.373
I told you.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.342
In the garden.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.915
Kids?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.519
Kids?!

23:40.787 --> 23:42.455
Kids?

23:51.598 --> 23:54.266
No. No!

23:54.300 --> 23:56.302
No! No!

23:56.335 --> 23:58.705
(whimpering)

24:00.039 --> 24:03.876
No! No! No! No!

24:08.881 --> 24:10.349
No! No!

24:11.951 --> 24:14.253
(groans, pants)

24:14.286 --> 24:17.323
-(panting)
-You do understand, don't you?

24:17.356 --> 24:20.359
It had to be this way.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.394
They're the reason why I died.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.032
What?

24:26.065 --> 24:28.535
-(panting)
-I needed you, Andy.

24:28.568 --> 24:31.170
They took you from me.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.573
They did this.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.614
I know my wife.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.550
She would never say
something like that,

24:43.583 --> 24:45.151
not in a million years.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.619
Never.

24:46.653 --> 24:49.556
Well, you also never thought
I'd kill myself.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.390
Nikki was depressed.

24:51.423 --> 24:52.825
Because of them.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.360
No, that's not the way it works.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.328
There's no... there's no blame.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.397
It's a chemical imbalance
in the brain.

24:58.430 --> 25:02.201
The only imbalance was a house
full of someone else's children,

25:02.234 --> 25:05.237
and a husband too busy being
Father of the Year to notice

25:05.271 --> 25:07.740
what was happening
right underneath his nose.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.341
(guttural gasping)

25:09.375 --> 25:11.678
I can see pretty clearly
right now.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.481
-You're not my wife.
-(gasping): Andy...

25:15.514 --> 25:17.316
These aren't my memories.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.551
Get out of my head!

25:18.585 --> 25:20.152
You don't remember, Andy!

25:20.186 --> 25:22.188
You don't remember
what those children were like!

25:22.221 --> 25:23.923
(echoing):
Let me show you.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.533
Mmm. You taste
like mac and cheese.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.035
You like that?

25:36.068 --> 25:37.670
Oh, it's so hot.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.139
(both laughing)

25:43.776 --> 25:46.713
-Mmm.
-(indistinct shouting)

25:46.746 --> 25:48.581
-CALEB: No, I didn't.
-TRUCK: You looked at it!

25:48.615 --> 25:49.916
(indistinct shouting)

25:49.949 --> 25:51.684
-Should we...?
-Absolutely not.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.220
TRUCK:
I worked so hard on that!

25:54.253 --> 25:56.122
(whispering):
I think we're safe.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.690
Okay.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.458
(feet running, door opens)

25:59.491 --> 26:01.794
I can't believe you did that.
Caleb stepped on my diorama set,

26:01.828 --> 26:03.062
-and it's broke. -It was
in the middle of the room.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.196
It was on my side of the room!

26:04.230 --> 26:05.264
-Hey, guys.
-I can have stuff there.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.298
TRUCK:
It was on my side of the room!

26:06.332 --> 26:07.433
He threw a piece at my head!

26:07.466 --> 26:09.135
Guys, this is part
of sharing a room.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.203
Go back to bed. Now.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.539
I don't want to share a room
with him. I-It... He's an idiot!

26:13.572 --> 26:14.741
-ANDY: Out, now. Hey!
-That's-- hey!

26:14.774 --> 26:15.808
-You...
-Boys!

26:15.842 --> 26:17.576
Go back to bed!

26:17.610 --> 26:19.746
Ah, that is-- Stop it.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.648
-Okay? Break it up.
-TRUCK: I'm not an idiot.

26:21.681 --> 26:24.150
Go on. We'll talk about it
in the morning.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.185
(sighs)

26:30.757 --> 26:32.358
Hey, you okay?

26:36.696 --> 26:40.499
What if we're not cut out
for this?

26:40.532 --> 26:42.134
(sniffles)

26:42.168 --> 26:45.371
What if we made a mistake?

26:46.472 --> 26:48.107
That's not how it happened.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.342
-That's now what she said.
-You sure about that?

26:50.376 --> 26:51.978
They walked in on us,
it was an accident.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.179
It was an accident!

26:53.212 --> 26:54.246
Well, everything's an accident

26:54.280 --> 26:55.848
when it's not your fault.

26:55.882 --> 26:58.150
Or maybe you just don't want
to see the truth.

26:58.184 --> 27:01.487
VERITY: Please,
don't act like you care.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.455
NICOLE: Of course I care about
you. You're my daughter.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.957
VERITY:
I'm not your daughter.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.358
Why can't you get that
through your head?

27:06.392 --> 27:08.327
I already have
one worthless mom.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.762
I don't need another.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.364
-Verity.
-NICOLE: Listen, Verity,

27:12.398 --> 27:13.966
I understand
you're very upset right now.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.301
VERITY:
Then send me back.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.436
Get me off this lame-ass island.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.606
O-Out of this lame-ass
make-believe family.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.441
I wish you never would have
brought me here.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.310
All we've ever done is love you.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.846
All you've ever done
is cash a paycheck.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.480
Why don't you go pop

27:28.514 --> 27:30.683
some crazy pills and cry
in the bathroom some more?

27:30.717 --> 27:32.018
It's not like the rest of us
haven't heard you already.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.053
Enough.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.422
Enough.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.697
(quietly):
Whatever.

27:46.398 --> 27:47.900
Nikki, she didn't mean it.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.702
She didn't mean it.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.237
Baby, please.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.039
Baby.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.640
MARCUS:
And it's got its filthy hands

27:54.673 --> 27:56.976
wrapped around your memories.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.511
It lies, Andy.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.313
It twists.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.514
Is that all you got?

28:02.548 --> 28:05.084
(rumbling)

28:05.117 --> 28:08.154
'Cause you don't know
my daughter.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.056
You sure as hell
don't know Nicole,

28:10.089 --> 28:12.491
because that is not
how it ended.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.827

28:14.861 --> 28:17.396
That's not how it ended!

ANDY (mumbling):
That's not how it ended.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.400
That's not how it ended.

28:21.433 --> 28:22.601
That's it, Andy.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.371
You hold on to what's real.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.973
Hold on, and don't let go.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.918

Andy?

29:20.526 --> 29:22.528

Nikki?

29:53.359 --> 29:54.861
TRUCK:
What does it mean?

29:54.894 --> 29:57.296
-Truck. -"Don't forget
I will always love you."

29:57.329 --> 29:59.031

"Always love you."

30:00.466 --> 30:02.101
I don't get it.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.570
Verity, you take
my earbuds again?

30:06.906 --> 30:08.474
Where are you going, Andy?

30:08.507 --> 30:10.910
Let go.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.115
You shouldn't go out there.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.349
Get out of my way.

30:17.383 --> 30:20.052
VERITY:
That's a bad idea.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.287
This is where you belong.

With us.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.490
Forever.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.273

No. Nikki?

31:27.819 --> 31:30.389
HARPER:
You said she was pretty.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.758
She doesn't look pretty to me.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.262
I'm glad she's dead.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.364
No.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.567

I'm glad she's dead.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.539
I'm glad she's dead.

That's not the way it happened.

That's not

31:58.517 --> 32:01.653

Untie him.

Flip him over!

32:19.538 --> 32:21.240

32:21.273 --> 32:22.508
You're all right.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.443
Just breathe. Breathe.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.512
You're all right.

32:26.545 --> 32:30.116

Help me.

Till the end, my friend.

It's twisting your perception.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.916
Andy, can you hear me?

33:39.118 --> 33:41.320
We could do other things.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.090
-Terrible things.

I think he's waking up.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.140
Keep him talking.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.741
He needs something familiar
to hold onto.

Okay?

Where are the kids?

They're safe.

35:03.302 --> 35:05.971
I promise.

35:06.004 --> 35:09.275
I gave them a free pass
from homework

35:09.308 --> 35:11.143

I'm, like, their best friend.

done it when I first got here.

They're really worried
about you, Andy.

How much...

You don't understand...

They're trying to save you.

You did this.

You brought them here...

to my house.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.494
Where are my kids?!
