00:18.185 --> 00:20.225
[narrator] In Texas...

00:23.423 --> 00:25.463
...officers race
to a bank robbery.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.933
Stopped my car at about
20 yards off of his truck.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.374
[gunshots]

00:32.399 --> 00:34.069
[Officer Clint Brandon]

00:35.235 --> 00:37.935
[dispatcher over radio]

00:37.971 --> 00:40.841
The suspect just tried
to murder me
at 9:00 in the morning.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.444
[gunshots]

00:43.477 --> 00:45.677
There’s about 100 witnesses
standing around.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.921
[narrator] In the city
of Indio, California...

00:51.285 --> 00:53.555
...a routine callout...

00:53.587 --> 00:56.717
Dispatch radioed and said
there was a welfare check

00:56.757 --> 00:58.787
of a male
at an apartment complex.

00:58.825 --> 00:59.825
[knocking on door]

01:01.395 --> 01:04.605
[explosion]

01:04.631 --> 01:06.031
[Division Fire Chief
Mark Oakley] I couldn’t even
see his feet.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.966
He was engulfed in flames.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.301
[narrator] And...

01:09.336 --> 01:14.136
...in Georgia, a crash victim
fights for his life.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.215
[defibrillator]
Shock delivered.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.447
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:25.018 --> 01:26.488
[officer] Put your hands up
and come outside!

01:36.997 --> 01:38.767
[narrator] Just South
of Waco, Texas...

01:39.900 --> 01:41.500
...is the city of Hewitt.

01:43.804 --> 01:47.274
[Brandon] February 5, 2019
was a Tuesday.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.137
And about 9:00 that morning...

01:49.176 --> 01:51.506
[dispatcher]

01:51.545 --> 01:55.385
[caller]

01:55.415 --> 02:00.115
Dispatch put out the call
over the radio of
a possible robbery in progress

02:00.153 --> 02:02.593
at Point West Bank
on 420 North Hewitt Drive,

02:02.623 --> 02:05.733
which was less than
a block away
from where I was at.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.527
[narrator] During the robbery,

02:42.562 --> 02:47.502
the masked robber
forces the bank clerk
to fill his bag with cash...

02:49.936 --> 02:51.436
...at gunpoint.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.660
[Brandon] Yeah, I pulled into
the back of the bank through
the drive-through teller area.

03:17.297 --> 03:21.597
I could see a pickup backed in
right by the front door
in a handicapped spot.

03:23.236 --> 03:26.236
Stopped my car at about
20 yards off of his truck.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.678
[Brandon]

03:33.013 --> 03:35.653
[dispatcher]

03:35.682 --> 03:38.482
[Brandon] And, uh, a hooded
subject running
out of the front of the bank.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.794
Drew my weapon on him
and ordered him
to show me his hands,

03:43.824 --> 03:47.234
and that was when
he opened fire with
a semiautomatic .22 rifle.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.525
[gunshots] He ended up
firing between
six and ten rounds.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.695
[gunshots]

03:57.738 --> 03:59.308
I immediately
returned fire on him.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.439
[gunshots]

04:04.778 --> 04:07.308
This is the first time
I’ve ever fired my weapon
in the line of duty.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.221
I ended up getting pinned
behind my car,

04:13.253 --> 04:16.523
and that was when his rifle
jammed on him

04:16.556 --> 04:19.586
and he got back in the truck
and took off,

04:19.626 --> 04:20.986
and that was
when the pursuit started.

04:22.929 --> 04:27.999
You have an individual
encountering a police officer
in full uniform,

04:28.034 --> 04:33.514
driving a marked police car,
with no question
as to who he is,

04:33.540 --> 04:36.410
-fires a weapon
at that officer.
-[gunshots]

04:36.443 --> 04:39.883
This individual displayed
some of the most evilness

04:39.913 --> 04:41.513
that I’ve seen
in this business.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.293
Had no care for humanity
whatsoever.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.961
As we’re pulling
out of the parking lot,
we just miss an 18-wheeler...

04:50.991 --> 04:54.131
[horn blares]

04:54.161 --> 04:55.731
...that’s headed
Northbound on Hewitt drive.

04:56.663 --> 05:00.203
-[dispatcher]
-[siren blares]

05:02.169 --> 05:04.939
[Brandon] At 9:00
in the morning on a,
on a weekday

05:04.971 --> 05:09.011
is a pretty busy time
for the City of Hewitt.

05:09.042 --> 05:12.182
To avoid all the other
traffic, he’s running down
the center turn lane.

05:12.879 --> 05:18.349
[Brandon]

05:19.586 --> 05:22.086
[dispatcher]

05:22.122 --> 05:23.592
[siren blares]

05:23.623 --> 05:26.463
[Brandon] And, uh, we made it
about a block or two
down the road

05:26.493 --> 05:28.393
before he stops
in the middle of the road.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.758
[Brandon]

05:31.965 --> 05:36.605
[gunshots]

05:43.710 --> 05:44.840
[Brandon]

05:53.620 --> 05:56.960
[dispatcher]

05:56.990 --> 06:01.030
As he’s stopping, I’m trying
to give out a description
of his license plate.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.261
And by the time I realized
what he’s doing, he’s already
out of the car,

06:04.297 --> 06:07.127
he’s got a shotgun
in his hand, and he’s
shooting into my windshield.

06:09.236 --> 06:15.606
[gunshots, siren blares]

06:15.642 --> 06:18.282
I can hear him
firing the weapon,

06:18.311 --> 06:20.151
I can hear the rounds
hitting the windshield.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.220
I can hear him
working the slide
on the shotgun.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.779
That’s how I knew
it was a pump-action,

06:23.817 --> 06:26.247
I could actually hear him
working the action on it.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.991
To realize that those
are real bullets
coming at you,

06:30.023 --> 06:32.763
and it’s really somebody
trying to kill you...

06:32.792 --> 06:35.702
I could hear the thwack
of every round
hitting the windshield.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.799
[gunshots]

06:36.830 --> 06:39.000
One shot right down
the driver side door,

06:39.032 --> 06:41.632
hit my spotlight,
hit my rearview mirror.

06:41.668 --> 06:45.768
Uh, one shot went
right over my head. Uh,

06:45.805 --> 06:49.875
hit my light bar, sent a few
rounds a couple of inches
over the top of my head.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.210
Uh, one round
hit the dash camera
and destroyed it.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.616
One hit my onboard computer
and destroyed it.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.019
One hit my radar
and destroyed it.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.251
And that’s also
the round that hit me.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.757
I got hit twice by buckshot
while I was in the car.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.120
[gunshot]

07:05.158 --> 07:08.058
They say you just
kind of go
to a different place, and...

07:08.094 --> 07:10.534
...fall back on your training
and do what you have to do
to stay alive.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.398
I’m bleeding
and I’ve been hit.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.403
We’re in the middle
of traffic, so I can’t really
shoot back.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.306
I’d risk
hitting somebody else.

07:19.339 --> 07:23.139
My really only option
at that point was
to put my vehicle into reverse

07:23.176 --> 07:24.736
and try and put some distance
between us,

07:24.778 --> 07:26.878
and make myself
a harder target to hit.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.321
[dispatcher]

07:34.821 --> 07:38.931
[Brandon]

07:38.959 --> 07:40.989
I immediately knew
I was hit in the shoulder.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.997
I could feel it
and I looked down.
I could see blood,

07:44.030 --> 07:47.830
but I could see that it wasn’t
gushing blood, so I knew
an artery wasn’t hit.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.537
And my arm still worked,
so I knew
a bone wasn’t broken.

07:50.570 --> 07:54.340
At that point, I didn’t really
see any reason
to stop chasing him.

07:54.374 --> 07:58.014
And then I started
giving information
on the pursuit again.

07:58.044 --> 08:03.224
And that was the point when
Sergeant Sprung and Officer
Wood showed up on scene.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.834
I was dealing
with a massive
adrenaline dump.

08:13.860 --> 08:18.060
Three or four rounds
went within a few inches
of my head.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.968
A suspect just
tried to murder me
at 9:00 in the morning

08:21.001 --> 08:25.141
in the middle of Hewitt Drive
with about 100 witnesses
standing around.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.711
Um, rather than panicking,
it just kinda made me
more hyper-focused on him

08:29.743 --> 08:32.653
and kind of
ignoring everything else
going on around me.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.149
I just wanted to keep
chasing that guy
’til I caught him.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.649
The pursuit got going.
We started picking up speed.

08:39.686 --> 08:44.316
I got a lot of wind noise
coming through the vehicle
from all the bullet holes.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.734
The back windshield
had been completely blown out,

08:50.764 --> 08:53.234
because some rounds
went all the way
through the car.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.036
Starts making it very hard
for me to hear anything
over my radio.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.110
[Sergeant Sprung]

09:00.206 --> 09:04.606
[Brandon]

09:07.547 --> 09:09.377
Sergeant ended up getting
behind me,

09:09.416 --> 09:11.276
and was trying to get me
to get out of the pursuit.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.787
He was telling me
to pull over.

09:12.819 --> 09:16.389
And it took a minute
for it to register
that he was talking to me.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.293
I could hear chatter
on the radio.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.994
But I couldn’t make out
what it was.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.343
Officer Brandon
showed extreme poise.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.939
The way he handled
that situation
was second to none.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.541
[gunshots]

09:33.573 --> 09:37.313
The damage to that vehicle,
it... It looked like
it had been in a war.

09:37.343 --> 09:40.213
Not knowing the extent
of his injuries,

09:40.246 --> 09:43.516
we had to make sure
that he was gonna be
in good condition.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.290
So we needed to get him
to medical help.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.859
Catching bad guys like that
is why people become cops.

09:55.895 --> 10:00.695
And he’s probably one of
the worst people I’ve ever
come across in my career,

10:00.733 --> 10:03.803
and now, I’m being told
that I can’t
chase him anymore.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.943
That was
pretty painful to hear.

10:09.342 --> 10:13.312
[Brandon]

10:17.617 --> 10:19.847
[dispatcher over radio]

10:19.886 --> 10:21.946
[Brandon] Pulled over
onto the shoulder.

10:21.988 --> 10:26.088
Got my trauma kit out,
took my outer carrier vest
off, laid it on the hood,

10:26.126 --> 10:30.226
and then started administering
some first aid to myself
where I had been shot.

10:30.263 --> 10:34.003
Just a few seconds after that
was when some other units
started showing up on scene.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.800
[officer]

10:45.879 --> 10:48.309
[Brandon] They put me
in the truck and drove me
to the hospital.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.548
[officer]

10:52.986 --> 10:54.716
[officer] Okay, Edward,
we’re coming up on him

10:54.754 --> 10:56.324
but we’re not gonna be able
to catch up with him
immediately.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.088
[dispatcher] Texas Patrol
is negative.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.356
[officer]

11:02.262 --> 11:04.232
Being dispatched.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.474
There’s a mix of emotions
that are... That are going on.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.370
We weren’t too far behind, uh,
Sergeant Sprung
and the suspect.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.814
I know Officer Brandon.
We went through
the police academy together.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.981
Our mind is focused
on ensuring
the safety of the public.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.719
Stay calm, and,
and get your job done,

11:22.749 --> 11:26.819
in making sure that suspect
is in our custody.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.423
As we approached,
uh, Highway Six,

11:29.455 --> 11:31.385
it, it got a little busy.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.294
[officer] Chad, do you say
we just roll in there
and take him?

11:35.995 --> 11:36.925
[Officer Woods]

11:39.899 --> 11:41.499
[dispatcher over radio]

11:42.969 --> 11:45.669
[Woods] Shortly after
going underneath
the interstate...

11:45.705 --> 11:47.965
[officer]

11:48.007 --> 11:51.437
[Woods] ...he hit
a wooden fence,
and he wrecked out.

11:51.477 --> 11:55.107
Suspect’s vehicle
was inside of a fence.

11:55.148 --> 11:59.448
He had taken out one side
of the fence on the right side
of the roadway,

11:59.485 --> 12:01.885
crossed over the street,
and took out another fence.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.291
And that’s where
he came to a stop.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.959
Sergeant Sprung,
he was our
number one vehicle.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.405
He was stopped.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.130
Uh, myself and Officer Nines,
we were number two.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.996
And we positioned our vehicle

12:15.034 --> 12:19.414
to somewhat block the roadway
from where we just came from.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.475
When he got out of the truck,
I had my rifle.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.778
Pulled my rifle up,
and I remember looking through
my scope and looking at him.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.163
[sirens]

12:39.192 --> 12:41.592
[Woods] And the suspect
got his rifle
and got the backpack,

12:41.628 --> 12:44.758
he took off down,
I don’t remember
what street it was.

12:44.797 --> 12:47.927
I remember Sergeant Sprung
getting in a position
where he could see him.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.242
Which we were all
trying to do.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.683
At that point,
we lost sight of him.

12:58.711 --> 13:02.181
So we all held our positions
until we can get
more units in the area.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.376
[officer]

13:07.320 --> 13:09.360
[Woods]

13:09.389 --> 13:10.919
[officer]

13:10.957 --> 13:12.557
[Woods]

13:19.365 --> 13:20.825
We didn’t know
what he was doing.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.067
We didn’t know if he was
going into somebody’s
back yard,

13:23.102 --> 13:25.702
or to somebody’s house
to hold up a position,

13:25.738 --> 13:31.538
or if he had that shotgun
somewhere in somebody’s
fence line, pointed at us.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.081
[officer]

13:34.113 --> 13:36.653
[Woods]

13:40.320 --> 13:44.490
When I arrived on scene,
we began to coordinate
a perimeter.

13:46.626 --> 13:50.356
[Woods]

13:50.396 --> 13:52.026
[Devlin]

13:52.065 --> 13:53.505
[Woods]

13:53.533 --> 13:56.973
[officer]

13:57.003 --> 13:58.843
[officer over radio]

13:58.871 --> 14:00.941
[Devlin] My officers
have seen this person.

14:00.973 --> 14:05.283
So now, we have good
visual identification
of who this person is.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.081
[officer]

14:08.114 --> 14:09.384
[officer over radio]

14:09.415 --> 14:11.915
So we begin to formulate
a game plan
and set up a perimeter.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.691
We don’t wanna
rush the situation,

14:13.720 --> 14:15.490
’cause we wanna get
a coordinated effort

14:15.521 --> 14:17.361
surrounding
the immediate area.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.332
Let’s not go in right away
guns a-blazin’.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.101
It’s more of a back-off.

14:23.129 --> 14:27.929
This isn’t our area,
so I don’t know where to send
people in this neighborhood.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.497
[indistinct chatter]

14:30.536 --> 14:32.666
But it’s a Waco PD
neighborhood.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.567
They know
where to send people.

14:37.944 --> 14:42.724
[narrator] Waco PD units
begin to systematically comb
the local neighborhood

14:42.749 --> 14:45.549
for any signs of the suspect.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.288
[Waco officer]

14:54.093 --> 14:56.233
[Devlin] We don’t need
to go in and get ambushed.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.362
[officer]

14:57.397 --> 15:00.167
[Woods]

15:02.001 --> 15:03.701
[Devlin] And then
we begin
to move in.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.636
And we’ll
utilize K9s or we’ll
utilize the helicopter,

15:07.673 --> 15:10.013
we’ll start to try to flush
this individual out.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.310
[dispatcher]

15:17.283 --> 15:18.853
[Waco officer]

15:51.784 --> 15:53.224
[dispatcher over radio]

15:53.753 --> 15:55.393
[officer over radio]

15:55.421 --> 15:57.361
Most suspects can’t sit
for very long.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.760
They don’t wanna sit
for very long, because
they wanna get moving.

15:59.792 --> 16:04.162
And ultimately, he came out
and attempted
just to walk down the street,

16:04.197 --> 16:09.837
when he was physically grabbed
by a couple very, uh, keen,
astute officers from Waco PD.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.906
[Waco officer]

16:17.210 --> 16:18.980
You know, ’cause he’s
bloodied from the accident.

16:19.011 --> 16:22.181
It doesn’t fit. It’s not
as if he’s walking
in the neighborhood.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.825
He sticks out
like a sore thumb.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.390
And they just,
they automatically
take him into custody.

16:26.419 --> 16:31.289
[narrator] The suspect
had hidden the bag of money
and shotgun behind a building,

16:31.324 --> 16:34.094
then attempted to walk out
of the area

16:34.126 --> 16:37.696
through police lines
as an innocent bystander.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.130
[Woods] Had this gone
any other way,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.836
I believe that there
could have been
more damage done.

16:42.869 --> 16:46.309
You know, more civilians hurt,
officers hurt.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.937
[Woods]

16:49.976 --> 16:51.176
[dispatcher over radio] Copy.
Yeah, re-identify...

16:51.210 --> 16:52.610
[officer]

16:52.645 --> 16:55.555
[Woods]

16:55.581 --> 16:58.521
[Woods] It coulda turned out
a lot worse than,
than it actually did.

17:01.387 --> 17:05.387
Look, we got a .32 caliber
buckshot pellet still
in my shoulder right now.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.764
I can feel it
pretty much every day.

17:07.793 --> 17:10.233
Uh, as far as the round,
it hit me in the vest,
my vest stopped that,

17:10.263 --> 17:13.033
so I didn’t get any damage
from that.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.425
And then basically,
my right arm was, uh,

17:15.468 --> 17:18.398
completely shredded
from the glass that was in it.

17:18.437 --> 17:21.807
And I had some bits of glass
in my face, as well.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.681
[narrator] The suspect
is Dallas Bohanon.

17:25.811 --> 17:28.751
[Devlin] He confessed
to three bank robberies.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.751
He was sentenced
to three life sentences.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.092
I had been in some
adrenaline-pumping
situations before,

17:36.122 --> 17:37.662
but none quite like this.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.360
[gunshots, siren blares]

17:42.495 --> 17:46.105
In the immediate aftermath,
before I was able
to go back onto patrol,

17:46.132 --> 17:49.802
I had to go sit
with the psychiatrist
for a little bit. Uh, that...

17:49.835 --> 17:54.465
That meeting took about 10,
15 minutes before he
cleared me to go back to work.

17:54.507 --> 17:58.137
Just determined that I wasn’t
suffering any PTSD
or anything like that from it.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.451
Which I wasn’t.

18:00.479 --> 18:04.419
[Devlin] Bohannon
had no empathy
during his sentencing.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.050
Uh, just didn’t seem to care.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.593
And that to me
makes a dangerous individual.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.692
So Bohanon got exactly
what he deserved.

18:18.864 --> 18:21.934
[narrator] 20 miles
East of Palm Springs,

18:21.968 --> 18:24.298
in the middle
of the California desert,

18:24.337 --> 18:26.337
is the City of Indio.

18:34.246 --> 18:38.976
Officer Nathan Quintana
of the Indio Police Department
is on patrol.

18:41.387 --> 18:46.187
His partner, 25-year-old
trainee Israel Campoa,

18:46.225 --> 18:49.325
has been on the force
for just three weeks.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.431
[Officer Nathan Quintana]
We were towards
the end of our shift.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.098
It’s August.

18:59.205 --> 19:02.885
It was probably about 100,
110 degrees out that day.

19:06.579 --> 19:11.149
[narrator] At 3:25, an
Indio Police Department
dispatcher takes a call.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.521
[dispatcher over phone]

19:14.553 --> 19:17.863
[caller over phone]

19:22.261 --> 19:27.131
[dispatcher]

19:27.166 --> 19:28.626

19:28.668 --> 19:30.868

19:30.903 --> 19:33.913
[caller]

19:33.939 --> 19:36.209
[dispatcher]

19:36.242 --> 19:38.442
[caller]

19:38.477 --> 19:39.507
[dispatcher] Okay.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.621
[Quintana] Dispatch radioed
and said there was
a welfare check

19:45.651 --> 19:47.491
of a male at
a apartment complex.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.560
Take a right right here.

19:50.589 --> 19:54.629
[Quintana] I recognized
the address and the, uh,
the name in the call.

19:54.660 --> 19:58.260
I’ve had past contacts
with this gentleman before.

19:58.297 --> 20:01.167
He gets agitated easily,
and he gets
really loud and aggressive.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.305
It heightens your senses.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.651
We park down the street.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.080
We start walking
up to the apartment complex.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.490
[Quintana]

20:35.801 --> 20:36.901
[Campoa]

20:41.907 --> 20:43.037

20:43.075 --> 20:44.335

[Campoa]

21:04.363 --> 21:05.203
[caller]

21:05.231 --> 21:06.531
[Campoa]

21:06.565 --> 21:07.925
[caller]

21:15.674 --> 21:20.314
-[Campoa]
-[caller]

21:20.346 --> 21:21.876
[Campoa]

21:25.050 --> 21:28.820
[Quintana] The manager
of the apartment complex
tells us that the day before,

21:28.854 --> 21:33.494
he had thrown his, uh,
stove out of the front door,

21:33.526 --> 21:35.726
um, which is a gas stove.

21:35.761 --> 21:39.161
She said that she believes
he has turned on
the gas today,

21:39.198 --> 21:41.728
and he has access
to turn the gas on and off

21:41.767 --> 21:43.637
from the valve
that comes out of the wall.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.337
My first thought was,
we need to get
this person out

21:47.373 --> 21:49.373
before something bad happens.

21:49.408 --> 21:53.308
[Quintana] I was concerned
about if there’s a gas leak
and it’s big enough,

21:53.345 --> 21:56.315
and it ignites, it’s gonna
create a big fireball.

22:00.052 --> 22:03.562
[Oakley] I was in my office
when the call came out.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.759
We were dispatched
to a possible structure fire.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.060
Proceed with caution.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.843
I’m about three miles
from where the call came from.

22:19.205 --> 22:22.245
I could see that
there’s no fire,
there’s no smoke,

22:22.274 --> 22:25.244
I don’t see anything
in that vicinity.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.807
As I’m getting closer,
I’m talking to my dispatch,

22:28.848 --> 22:33.388
are you receiving
any additional 911 calls,
they’re saying, no, uh,

22:33.419 --> 22:39.159
possible gas leak, uh,
reported by another 911 call,
but nothing about fire.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.661
[Quintana]

22:41.694 --> 22:43.564
[maintenance man]

22:43.596 --> 22:45.156
[Quintana]

22:45.197 --> 22:48.497
I requested the, uh,
maintenance man to come over
to, to help us out.

22:50.135 --> 22:50.895
[caller]

22:50.936 --> 22:51.696
[Campoa]

22:51.737 --> 22:54.167
[knocking on door]

22:55.474 --> 22:56.214
[caller]

22:57.476 --> 22:58.206
[Quintana]

23:00.212 --> 23:03.882
We wanted to make contact
with the, uh, gentleman
inside the apartment,

23:03.916 --> 23:06.176
to, to check his welfare
and make sure he was okay.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.148
[knocking on door]

23:08.187 --> 23:11.487
We knock on the door
a few times, and we get
no response.

23:14.927 --> 23:19.727
[Campoa] I can smell the gas
coming out from the, uh,
windows and the door.

23:19.765 --> 23:25.295
The worst case scenario
was a fire or something
bigger, like an explosion.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.637
And the person still being
inside the apartment.

23:28.774 --> 23:31.484
I started running scenarios
through my head,

23:31.510 --> 23:33.950
you know, are we gonna
have to start
evacuating people?

23:33.979 --> 23:35.179
[knocking on door]

23:35.214 --> 23:37.384
The gentleman inside,
is he conscious?

23:38.550 --> 23:40.050
Indio Police!

23:40.085 --> 23:43.045
I got my, my baton out
to knock on the door louder.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.818
[baton knocking on door]

23:44.857 --> 23:48.857
Right after I did it,
the gentleman inside either
threw something at the door,

23:48.894 --> 23:50.064
or kicked the door.

23:50.562 --> 23:52.102
[Campoa]

23:52.131 --> 23:53.371
[indistinct shouting]

23:53.399 --> 23:54.429
[Quintana]

23:59.338 --> 24:00.568
[indistinct shouting]

24:00.606 --> 24:02.906
[Quintana]

24:11.750 --> 24:14.290
I was like, okay,
well, he’s fine.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.560
You know, he’s breathing.
He was yelling
and cussing at us.

24:16.588 --> 24:17.588
[indistinct shouting]

24:17.623 --> 24:18.823
[Quintana]

24:25.331 --> 24:28.131
[siren blares]

24:32.838 --> 24:33.808
[Quintana]

24:33.839 --> 24:37.739
[caller]

24:45.617 --> 24:47.317
I saw the fire trucks
pulling up on the street,

24:47.353 --> 24:50.663
so I’m gonna go out
on the street, so the firemen
can do their job.

24:53.926 --> 24:54.856
[Quintana]

24:54.893 --> 24:55.933

24:59.298 --> 25:04.938

25:04.970 --> 25:17.680

-[Quintana]

25:26.959 --> 25:27.659
[Campoa]

25:27.693 --> 25:28.633

25:29.261 --> 25:30.301
[Quintana groaning in pain]

25:31.797 --> 25:32.797
[Quintana]

25:39.605 --> 25:44.385
As I’m walking
past the apartment,
I hear the air suck in.

25:44.410 --> 25:49.080
I felt a, uh, surge
of hot air, like a missile
striking something.

25:49.114 --> 25:52.224
-[explosion]
-[Quintana]

25:52.251 --> 25:54.891
And alls I see
is debris passing me.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.789
[Campoa] I heard a noise.

25:58.824 --> 26:02.134
I saw the roof
of the apartment
go up in the air.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.761
I saw fire
coming out of the roof.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.367
I felt the air
pushing you back
after an explosion.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.100
[Quintana] [bleeping]

26:11.136 --> 26:15.736
When the fireball
and the debris
started to engulf me,

26:15.774 --> 26:17.444
it seemed like
everything slowed down.

26:19.111 --> 26:23.111
I hear a, a rush of air
coming at me.

26:23.148 --> 26:27.148
I remember ducking my head
and trying to get as small
as possible as I’m running,

26:27.186 --> 26:28.746
because I knew
a fireball was coming.

26:28.787 --> 26:32.117
[explosion]

26:32.157 --> 26:35.027
And I could see every piece of
debris passing me,

26:35.060 --> 26:36.830
the flame, the smoke.

26:41.266 --> 26:45.136
[Oakley] I saw the fireball
consume the IPD officer.

26:45.170 --> 26:48.640
I couldn’t even see his feet.
He was engulfed in flames.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.438
I just saw him
disappear into a fireball.

26:52.478 --> 26:55.408
You know, and, and then
you’re thinking, oh, God,
come out of there alive.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.450
[Campoa]

27:03.388 --> 27:06.458
[Campoa] As soon as I saw
his hand, I saw
that it was burned.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.086
It was burned bad.

27:09.128 --> 27:13.058
To the point that I was, like,
this is not something
that he could just walk away.

27:13.098 --> 27:15.368
[Quintana grunts]
[bleep]

27:15.400 --> 27:16.330
[firefighter]

27:16.368 --> 27:18.468
[Campoa]

27:19.705 --> 27:23.545
My first thought was,
you know,
the gentleman inside.

27:23.575 --> 27:27.075
[Quintana]

27:30.082 --> 27:33.022
I looked down at it
and I could see that my arm
has been burned.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.851
I don’t know to what extent.

27:40.559 --> 27:44.259
It felt like when you burn
your, your hand on the stove.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.096
[Campoa]

27:45.130 --> 27:46.330
[Quintana]

27:46.365 --> 27:49.575
That kind of feeling,
but just all over
my, uh, my arm.

27:49.601 --> 27:50.701
[Quintana]

27:50.736 --> 27:51.736
[Campoa]

27:52.571 --> 27:55.311
[Quintana]

27:55.340 --> 27:57.680
The fire department
was already there
getting their gear on.

27:57.709 --> 27:58.539
[firefighter]

27:58.577 --> 28:01.247
[Quintana]

28:01.280 --> 28:02.450
[firefighter]

28:02.481 --> 28:04.921
[Quintana] I didn’t want
to bother them too much,

28:04.950 --> 28:08.920
’cause I knew they had
to go in and, and help the,
the gentleman inside.

28:08.954 --> 28:11.164
[Quintana]

28:11.190 --> 28:12.760
[firefighter]

28:13.959 --> 28:16.529
[Oakley] I just remember him
kinda holding his arm up,

28:16.562 --> 28:18.802
and seeing the skin
sloughing off.

28:19.231 --> 28:20.131
[Quintana]

28:20.165 --> 28:21.825
[Campoa]

28:21.867 --> 28:24.467
I’m also concerned,
did he inhale anything?

28:24.503 --> 28:28.173
How’s his breathing?
How’s his lung capacity?

28:28.207 --> 28:33.777
If you’re damaged internally
in your lungs, you literally
have minutes to live.

28:33.812 --> 28:35.012
[Campoa] Is there
evacuating people?

28:35.047 --> 28:37.447
[Quintana]

28:37.482 --> 28:38.652
[sirens blare]

28:38.684 --> 28:40.754
[Oakley] That officer,
I could tell he was in shock.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.790
But he still
wanted to do his job.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.163
[Quintana]

28:46.191 --> 28:47.691
[firefighter]

28:47.726 --> 28:51.396
Working with his partner,
trying to assist getting
other people out of there.

28:51.797 --> 28:56.167
[Quintana]

28:58.070 --> 29:00.810
And I was just like, no,
you are now a patient.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.136
And he still
was in police mode.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.948
[indistinct chatter]

29:08.981 --> 29:10.781
[Quintana] I don’t know
how bad the damage was.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.846
I didn’t know
if anybody else was hurt.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.554
If other buildings
were on fire.

29:14.953 --> 29:18.793
[Quintana]

29:20.092 --> 29:21.362
[firefighter]

29:28.000 --> 29:29.100
[Quintana]

29:32.304 --> 29:33.574
[Campoa]

29:38.076 --> 29:41.346
I knew there was probably
someone still
inside that building.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.680
That person
didn’t wanna come out.

29:43.715 --> 29:47.515
Let’s get the people
that are listening
away from harm’s way.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.260
Huh?

29:50.289 --> 29:53.589
[Campoa]

29:57.829 --> 29:59.329
[officer]

30:01.099 --> 30:02.869
[Quintana]

30:29.294 --> 30:33.364
[Oakley] Looked like he had
about 90% third degree burns.

30:33.398 --> 30:37.398
Most people that are exposed
to any type of explosion,

30:37.436 --> 30:41.936
they’re gonna feel
that temperature go up to 800,
maybe 1,000 degrees

30:41.973 --> 30:44.413
within a split second.

30:44.443 --> 30:49.353
You’re probably gonna take
one or two breaths
and inhale 800 degrees.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.581
So your chances
of survivability are not good.

30:52.617 --> 30:55.387
[EMT]

30:56.688 --> 30:59.418
[Quintana] I took off
all my gear that I had on,

30:59.458 --> 31:03.428
and just felt like I just ran,
you know, a marathon
or something.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.497
I was glad to be
in a ambulance, you know,
laying down.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.439
[Quintana]

31:11.470 --> 31:13.940
-[Campoa]
-[Quintana]

31:13.972 --> 31:16.072
[Campoa]

31:16.108 --> 31:20.808
[Campoa] Officer Quintana
seemed okay
inside the, uh, ambulance.

31:20.846 --> 31:26.376
He was taken
to a local hospital, to a,
uh, burn unit.

31:26.418 --> 31:30.088
[Quintana] When they
brought me in, they determined
it was a second degree burn.

31:30.122 --> 31:36.592
I got transported from, uh,
JFK Hospital in Indio
to Arrowhead Hospital.

31:36.628 --> 31:40.028
[Campoa] It took
the fire department
about an hour

31:40.065 --> 31:41.875
to, uh, put down the fire.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.870
And for the, uh,
helicopter to get there.

31:45.904 --> 31:50.114
[Quintana] The gentleman
in the apartment was airlifted
also to Arrowhead Hospital.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.913
He died the next day
from his injuries.

31:54.946 --> 31:57.946
[Oakley] When we
began investigating,

31:57.983 --> 32:00.293
we could see
that the stove was removed.

32:00.318 --> 32:03.018
There were some markings
on the valve.

32:03.054 --> 32:05.294
And the valve was still open.

32:05.323 --> 32:10.363
Um, from there,
we start to look at
how did the gas explode.

32:10.395 --> 32:12.795
Has there been
any maintenance done lately?

32:12.831 --> 32:17.471
Has there been any call out
for, hey, I’m having
a gas leak in my apartment.

32:18.203 --> 32:20.173
Everything came back negative.

32:20.205 --> 32:23.345
Everything just pointed back
to the resident inside,

32:23.375 --> 32:27.685
that he intentionally
took the, uh, the piping off,

32:27.712 --> 32:31.722
opened the gas valve,
so it leads to that
reasonable suspicion

32:31.750 --> 32:35.690
that he wanted
to commit suicide
and was successful at it.

32:35.720 --> 32:41.390
[Campoa] I think a few seconds
on that day made a,
uh, big difference.

32:43.895 --> 32:47.995
If I would have been
right in front of that window
when the explosion happened...

32:48.934 --> 32:50.374
...I think I woulda died.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.102
Or my injuries
would have been really bad.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.438
I don’t think I would be here.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.108
[Quintana] Put me out of work
for about five or six weeks

33:02.147 --> 33:05.877
just to let the, the skin
to grow back
to a good thickness,

33:05.917 --> 33:08.117
where I could work,
uh, safely.

33:08.153 --> 33:11.523
I don’t really
have any big scars from it.

33:11.556 --> 33:14.486
I, I do have a line
on the back of my tricep.

33:14.526 --> 33:19.196
You wouldn’t even notice it
if you just, uh,
looked at it real quick.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.905
[Oakley] ANy time that there’s
a massive explosion,

33:26.938 --> 33:29.808
if it’s confined
in any type of building,

33:29.841 --> 33:33.911
think of it as a bullet
that’s encased,

33:33.945 --> 33:36.345
and then it goes
down the barrel of a gun.

33:36.381 --> 33:38.821
All that energy
has to come out someplace.

33:41.887 --> 33:45.317
The walls are,
in this case, cinderblock,

33:45.357 --> 33:47.787
the weakest part is the door,

33:47.826 --> 33:51.426
the windows, and then
secondary, the roof.

33:51.463 --> 33:56.573
And the conditions
that were set up, uh,
that day were perfect.

33:56.601 --> 33:59.941
Hollywood couldn’t even
do a better production,

33:59.971 --> 34:04.281
’cause what I saw,
all the windows
and the fireball blow out,

34:04.309 --> 34:07.979
the roof literally lifted up,
and came back down.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.054
[Campoa] I think we were
extremely lucky that day.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.562
[Oakley] It always amazes me.

34:25.597 --> 34:31.497
Police officers
who have minimal firefighting
knowledge and training

34:31.536 --> 34:34.236
will be the first ones
to run into a building,

34:34.272 --> 34:36.372
whether it’s on fire
or full of gas.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.006
Yeah, they have
a bulletproof vest.

34:40.045 --> 34:44.085
It doesn’t mean
anything to a fire,
let alone an explosion.

34:44.115 --> 34:48.715
For them to put their lives
at risk like that,
that’s another hero.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.501
[narrator] In Georgia,
20 miles North of Atlanta,

35:03.535 --> 35:05.005
is Roswell.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.811
Veteran officer
Jeffrey Sanders
is on patrol,

35:12.844 --> 35:16.154
and leaving a service station.

35:16.181 --> 35:21.351
[Officer Jeff Sanders]
I see this, uh, large SUV on
the other side of the median.

35:21.386 --> 35:22.946
[siren blares]

35:22.988 --> 35:25.958
The vehicle’s either stalled,
or it was involved
in an accident.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.691
It was just hard to say
at first what was going on.

35:34.332 --> 35:37.402
We deal with seven to eight
accidents a day.

35:40.038 --> 35:43.608
This one struck me strange,
because it wasn’t
up against a tree,

35:43.642 --> 35:45.312
It was just kinda
sitting in the roadway.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.378
The airbags had been deployed,

35:48.413 --> 35:51.753
and I noticed a individual
sitting in the driver’s seat.

36:08.466 --> 36:10.766
I really can’t see
what’s going on,

36:10.802 --> 36:13.642
so I walk around
to the passenger side.

36:23.214 --> 36:25.524
I thought, we have
a pretty serious accident.

36:25.550 --> 36:26.850
You know, he’s knocked out.

36:26.885 --> 36:30.055
[narrator] The driver
cannot be safely moved.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.388
He could have
a neck or spinal injury.

36:45.170 --> 36:48.040
All of a sudden,
he goes into
an agonal breathing,

36:48.073 --> 36:51.213
which means he’s not
getting any air whatsoever.

36:51.242 --> 36:52.712
This guy’s
in a serious situation.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.454
I need to help him quick.

36:57.682 --> 36:58.822
This guy’s large.

37:01.186 --> 37:04.816
The only thing to do
is just to give him
a big bear hug.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.826
I was able to grab a hold
of him and squeeze him tight,

37:07.859 --> 37:10.559
and start pulling this guy
out of the driver’s seat.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.371
[Sanders grunting]

37:24.943 --> 37:28.413
When I got him
laid down on the ground,
I started doing CPR,

37:28.446 --> 37:29.906
started doing
chest compressions.

37:29.948 --> 37:33.478
I didn’t have time
to get my defibrillator
from my vehicle.

37:33.518 --> 37:34.688
Let’s go!

37:34.719 --> 37:36.619
I just knew that his heart
needed to start pumping blood.

37:36.654 --> 37:39.264
[Officer Jordan Wenslow]
I know I need to get there.

37:39.290 --> 37:41.490
And I know
I’m the closest unit to him.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.930
I turn the lights on,
turn the siren on,

37:44.963 --> 37:47.573
and I was there,
probably within two minutes.

37:47.599 --> 37:51.399
[siren blaring]

37:53.805 --> 37:56.375
[Sanders] When you hear
sirens approaching...

37:57.675 --> 38:00.205
...it’s like, whoo.
You know, I got help coming.

38:00.245 --> 38:01.115
You know, help’s here.

38:06.217 --> 38:10.487
I remember seeing my partner,
Officer Wenslow,
running up the roadway.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.192
He had the defibrillator.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.365
As he was unzipping the bag
and pulling out
all the contents,

38:20.398 --> 38:22.128
and getting ready
to get the pads ready,

38:23.034 --> 38:25.174
I continued CPR
chest compressions.

38:25.203 --> 38:27.673
[Sanders panting]

38:28.773 --> 38:30.373
[victim breathing with labor]

38:30.408 --> 38:33.538
[defibrillator] Begin
by removing all clothing
from the patient’s chest.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.508
These AEDs,
they’re very simple.

38:35.547 --> 38:39.377
Soon as you open the bag,
the machine itself
is telling you

38:39.417 --> 38:41.987
where and how
to apply the pads
to the patient.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.950
[defibrillator] Place pads
exactly as shown...

38:43.988 --> 38:45.358
[Sanders]

38:45.390 --> 38:46.290
[defibrillator] Press firmly
to place...

38:46.324 --> 38:47.564
[Sanders]

38:50.728 --> 38:52.258
[victim breathing with labor]

38:52.297 --> 38:56.267
[defibrillator] No one
should touch the patient.
Analyzing.

38:56.301 --> 38:59.471
He immediately
put the pads
onto the chest area.

38:59.504 --> 39:03.044
[defibrillator] Shock advised.
Stay clear of the patient.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.044
-[Wenslow]
-[Sanders]

39:04.075 --> 39:05.105
[defibrillator]
Shock delivered.

39:05.143 --> 39:07.113
[Sanders]

39:07.145 --> 39:09.785
I was like, wow.
That was a big shock.

39:09.814 --> 39:10.884
[Sanders]

39:10.915 --> 39:13.375
[defibrillator]

39:17.856 --> 39:19.416
We stood clear.
It gave one shock.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.431
We continued CPR.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.063
[Sanders]

39:29.701 --> 39:30.601
[Wenslow]

39:30.635 --> 39:33.105
[Sanders]

39:33.137 --> 39:37.437
As I was doing the second part
of the chest compressions,
this guy’s eyes fluttered.

39:39.277 --> 39:42.577
And I look at Officer Wenslow,
he looks at me,
and we’re like...

39:43.414 --> 39:45.854
...did that just happen?

39:45.884 --> 39:48.294
[Sanders]

39:48.319 --> 39:49.989
-[Wenslow]
-[Sanders]

39:50.021 --> 39:52.561
This guy, he just
opens his eyes.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.760
It’s like, [laughing] hey,
welcome back
to the living, you know?

39:55.793 --> 39:58.163
And he’s, he’s just,
just staring at us.

39:58.763 --> 40:00.463
[Sanders]

40:00.498 --> 40:02.098
-[Wenslow]
-[Sanders]

40:02.133 --> 40:05.443
[Wenslow] The best way
to describe it is almost
suddenly in a deep sleep,

40:05.470 --> 40:07.140
to all of a sudden,
they’re awake now.

40:07.171 --> 40:12.281
That surprise on their face,
and the surprise on your own,
that they’re now awake.

40:12.310 --> 40:15.110
-[Sanders]
-[Wenslow]

40:15.146 --> 40:16.706
-[Sanders]
-[Wenslow]

40:16.748 --> 40:17.648
-[Sanders]
-[Wenslow]

40:17.682 --> 40:19.022
-[victim]
-[Sanders]

40:19.050 --> 40:21.850
[Wenslow]

40:21.886 --> 40:24.756
[Wenslow] The fact
that he was talking,
he was becoming alert...

40:26.124 --> 40:27.224
...made it even better.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.728
[defibrillator] 45 seconds ...

40:28.760 --> 40:32.260
[Sanders]

40:32.297 --> 40:33.457
[Wenslow]

40:35.700 --> 40:37.370
[Sanders]

40:37.402 --> 40:38.102
[Wenslow]

40:38.136 --> 40:39.236
[Sanders]

40:40.738 --> 40:41.568
[victim]

40:41.606 --> 40:43.236
[Sanders]

40:43.274 --> 40:47.244
I remember when the EMS,
the ambulances, arrive,

40:47.278 --> 40:53.448
you get a sense of,
[sighs in relief] relief
knowing that this guy’s,

40:53.484 --> 40:55.054
is still in serious condition.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.021
[Wenslow]

40:58.056 --> 40:59.586
[EMT]

40:59.624 --> 41:00.324
[Wenslow]

41:00.892 --> 41:01.592
[victim]

41:02.393 --> 41:04.733
[Wenslow]

41:05.496 --> 41:06.196
[victim]

41:06.230 --> 41:10.030
[Wenslow]

41:10.068 --> 41:11.968
[defibrillator]

41:12.003 --> 41:14.713
-[Wenslow]
-[Sanders]

41:14.739 --> 41:17.979
[Wenslow] So Jeff and I,
when that relief hit us,

41:18.009 --> 41:19.409
we shared a fist bump,

41:19.444 --> 41:21.014
and then it was
back to business.

41:21.746 --> 41:23.646
We had work to continue to do.

41:24.983 --> 41:28.193
[Sanders]

41:28.219 --> 41:31.759
[narrator] Emergency
responders take the
56-year-old to the hospital.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.191
He survives the ordeal.

41:36.861 --> 41:40.831
Now, the officers turn
their attention to the SUV.

41:40.865 --> 41:42.295
[Sanders]

41:42.333 --> 41:43.233
[Wenslow]

41:44.736 --> 41:46.136
[Sanders]

41:46.170 --> 41:49.540
[Wenslow]

41:49.574 --> 41:52.984
[EMT]

41:53.011 --> 41:53.981
[Sanders]

41:54.012 --> 41:55.012
[EMT]

41:56.814 --> 42:01.124
It could have been a lot worse
as far as his foot continuing
to be on the accelerator,

42:01.152 --> 42:04.022
and the vehicle
gaining a lot higher speed.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.329
[Wenslow] Obviously,
in our job, we have days

42:10.361 --> 42:11.701
that are just horrible.

42:11.729 --> 42:14.369
And then one day,
you’re gonna have
a great day like this,

42:14.399 --> 42:16.269
where you save someone’s life.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.340
And you go,
yeah, that’s, that’s why
I got into this job. That’s...

42:19.370 --> 42:21.410
That’s what I wanted to do.
I wanted to make a difference.

42:22.473 --> 42:25.583
[narrator] Officer Sanders
has since retired.

42:25.610 --> 42:28.050
[Sanders] I’m not as young
as I used to be,

42:28.079 --> 42:29.479
or as strong as I used to be.

42:29.514 --> 42:30.754
And being able to,

42:30.782 --> 42:33.022
to help this guy
out of this vehicle,
get him back

42:33.051 --> 42:38.061
to where he could be
with his family, was just, uh,
something to, uh,

42:38.089 --> 42:39.659
end a law enforcement
career with.

42:39.690 --> 42:42.790
It was, uh, something pretty,
uh, special and exciting.
