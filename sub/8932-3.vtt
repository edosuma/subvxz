WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.570
Aah!

00:04.637 --> 00:06.506
What in blazes
is all that racket?

00:06.506 --> 00:08.975
The Pigs: Uaaaah!
Ghosts?!

00:10.710 --> 00:12.178
(monster roaring

00:13.580 --> 00:14.814
Yiiiikes!

00:14.814 --> 00:17.884
I'm going to sleep in
the haunted house tonight.

00:17.884 --> 00:18.952
Yikes!

00:20.620 --> 00:21.021
the
Evergreen forest.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.292
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.663
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.663 --> 00:32.165
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.633 --> 00:35.535
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:36.703 --> 00:37.704
Yikes!

00:38.705 --> 00:39.706
Yaaaah...

00:42.375 --> 00:43.843
Yeaaaah!

00:43.843 --> 00:46.880
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.656
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:58.291 --> 00:59.692
Cyril Sneer!

01:03.229 --> 01:05.565
And his life would be simple
except for...

01:06.332 --> 01:08.068
the Raccoons!!

01:08.068 --> 01:10.070
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:22.882 --> 01:25.385
When the moon is full over
the Evergreen forest

01:25.385 --> 01:26.953
and the stars are out,

01:26.953 --> 01:28.855
it's sometimes very difficult

01:28.855 --> 01:31.091
to distinguish myth
from reality.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.660
And as bedtime draws near,

01:33.660 --> 01:35.728
there are few who feel
safe enough to

01:35.728 --> 01:37.797
close their eyes
and go to sleep,

01:37.797 --> 01:40.900
because the strange sights
and sounds of the forest

01:40.900 --> 01:43.603
can play havoc with
the imagination.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.173
Tell us a
story please, Dad?

01:47.173 --> 01:49.175
Yeah, tell us
the one about ghosts

01:49.175 --> 01:51.311
that come on when
there's a full moon!

01:52.545 --> 01:53.980
What makes you think
that ghosts come out

01:53.980 --> 01:55.315
when there's a full moon?

01:55.315 --> 01:57.884
Well,
everybody knows that.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.619
Yeah,
everybody knows that.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.621
Huh?!

02:01.621 --> 02:03.256
Julie, you
better go to sleep,

02:03.256 --> 02:05.625
if Dad's going to
tell us about ghosts.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.595
You always get scared
by things like that.

02:08.595 --> 02:09.729
Boo!!

02:09.729 --> 02:12.098
No, I don't!!
Yes, you do.

02:12.098 --> 02:14.300
You're always afraid
of things like that.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.236
I'm am not!!
You are too!

02:16.236 --> 02:19.272
Okay, settle down, kids,
so I can tell the story.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.310
It was a dark and misty night,

02:24.310 --> 02:27.380
when two strangers hiking
deep in the forest,

02:27.380 --> 02:30.316
came upon an old
abandoned house.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.586
A house that, according to
legend, was haunted!

02:34.420 --> 02:37.824
As the two strangers slowly
stepped onto the porch,

02:37.824 --> 02:40.293
the full moon suddenly
broke through

02:40.293 --> 02:43.796
...and the front door
mysteriously opened.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.635
W-what was that?

02:48.635 --> 02:51.771
It's okay, kids.
It's just Broo.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.973
I knew that.
So did I!

02:53.973 --> 02:56.075
I was just trying
to scare Julie.

02:56.075 --> 02:57.443
Honest!

02:57.443 --> 02:58.912
Oh, Tommy!

03:00.647 --> 03:03.416
Meanwhile, in
another part of the forest,

03:03.416 --> 03:06.619
something strange
was about to unfold

03:06.619 --> 03:09.122
that would separate
myth from reality.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.160
Earlier that same day,

03:14.160 --> 03:16.629
Ralph and Bert Raccoon
and their friend Cedric,

03:16.629 --> 03:18.865
were preparing for
a special trip

03:18.865 --> 03:21.367
to the Raccoon's Boyhood Fort.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.771
Just think of it.
In a few short hours,

03:24.771 --> 03:27.507
we'll be relaxing
in our secret Fort.

03:27.507 --> 03:30.443
Ah, I haven't seen it
since we were kids.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.745
It'll be the perfect home
away from home way.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.948
Wait'll you see it, Cedric!

03:34.948 --> 03:37.850
Ah, yes. The old fort!

03:37.850 --> 03:41.020
Smack dab in the middle
of the wilderness.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.991
It's wild and woolly,
untamed too!

03:44.991 --> 03:48.761
And the fish are 10 feet long!!

03:48.761 --> 03:51.264
10 feet long!?

03:51.264 --> 03:54.334
Yeah, and those
are just the guppies.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.970
Okay, I'm all packed too.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.505
Huh?! Ralph?!

03:59.505 --> 04:01.207
Um... well...

04:01.207 --> 04:03.142
It might be a little rugged.

04:03.142 --> 04:05.678
We're going to be
hiking and fishing and

04:05.678 --> 04:07.981
portaging and,
and chopping wood,

04:07.981 --> 04:09.382
and fighting rapids...

04:09.382 --> 04:11.751
But I can do all that.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.920
Ha, are you kidding?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.756
And besides, we don't
allow any girls

04:16.756 --> 04:19.025
in our fort, do we, Ralph?

04:19.025 --> 04:20.893
Ooh, Bert!

04:20.893 --> 04:23.096
Cedric, are you
going to join a club

04:23.096 --> 04:24.831
that doesn't allow girls?

04:24.831 --> 04:27.066
Well...

04:27.066 --> 04:30.103
Uh, Cedric, remember
the secret handshake?

04:31.004 --> 04:32.872
Well...
Cedric!?

04:32.872 --> 04:35.575
And don't forget
the secret initiation.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.443
That's the best part!

04:37.443 --> 04:39.245
Well, I guess so.

04:39.245 --> 04:40.913
I think.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.049
Secret handshake?

04:43.049 --> 04:45.618
Secret initiation?!

04:45.618 --> 04:47.787
I still don't
see why I can't come!

04:48.554 --> 04:50.890
Well, if you
really wanna know,

04:50.890 --> 04:53.059
it's because of
the haunted house.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.927
Haunted house?!

04:55.795 --> 04:57.764
Yeah, the haunted house.

04:57.764 --> 05:00.099
It's not the safest place.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.904
Oh, I'm not afraid
of a darned old haunted house.

05:04.904 --> 05:07.140
Oh, well,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.608
what about ghosts?

05:09.442 --> 05:11.778
G-g-gh-ghosts?

05:11.778 --> 05:14.514
Not, g-g-g-g-ghosts!

05:14.514 --> 05:17.183
Just your plain, ordinary,

05:17.183 --> 05:20.486
scare ya' right out of
your wits ghosts!

05:20.486 --> 05:23.256
That's all.
(sighs) What ghosts?!

05:23.256 --> 05:26.726
Whenever there's
a full moon out,

05:26.726 --> 05:29.228
the ghosts come out
in the forest

05:29.228 --> 05:32.932
to scare unsuspecting campers!

05:33.966 --> 05:35.802
Uaaaah!

05:35.802 --> 05:39.005
They attack when
you least suspect it.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.008
Slowly and quietly,

05:42.008 --> 05:45.011
they sneak up behind you,
and then...

05:45.011 --> 05:46.579
Booo!
Uaaah!

05:46.579 --> 05:48.648
Well, we don't
want to go to your

05:48.648 --> 05:51.517
silly old fort anyway,
do we, Melissa?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.486
I guess not.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.856
Melissa,
we won't be gone long.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.158
It's just a night
with the guys.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.194
Come on,
let's get going!

06:01.194 --> 06:04.297
Now, are you sure
you boys are going to be okay,

06:04.297 --> 06:06.366
all alone out there?

06:06.366 --> 06:09.102
Hah! Don't worry about us.

06:09.102 --> 06:12.538
We're trail-blazers, pioneers.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.541
We know that wilderness
like the back of our hands.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.878
Come on, troops!

06:20.046 --> 06:21.881
Melissa/Sophia:

06:23.516 --> 06:25.651
Well, we'll see
you girls later!

06:27.053 --> 06:29.389
Cedric/Bert: Bye!
Bye now.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.091
Bye!
Bye!

06:37.663 --> 06:38.965
Wouldn't you know it?

06:38.965 --> 06:41.401
Bert forgot his moose horn.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.237
So the three
brave hikers

06:44.237 --> 06:46.038
were off on their adventure,

06:46.038 --> 06:48.541
without a care in the world.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.715
Hey, all
that stuff about ghosts

06:55.715 --> 06:58.451
that wasn't really true, was it?

06:58.451 --> 06:59.786
Naaah!

06:59.786 --> 07:02.054
And all that
stuff about scaring

07:02.054 --> 07:03.856
campers out of their minds?

07:03.856 --> 07:06.559
That wasn't true either, was it?

07:06.559 --> 07:08.261
Naaah!

07:08.261 --> 07:10.396
I just said that stuff
to scare the girls.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.266
Phew,
that's a relief!

07:15.535 --> 07:19.238
And all that stuff
about a haunted house,

07:19.238 --> 07:22.308
you were just kidding
about that too, right?

07:22.308 --> 07:23.743
Nope!

07:26.412 --> 07:29.081
Hey, Cedric, come on!

07:29.081 --> 07:31.751
Are we men? Or are we mice?

09:21.027 --> 09:23.663
Well, if my map is right,

09:23.663 --> 09:25.197
it's just over this hill

09:25.197 --> 09:26.632
and around that corner.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.569
But before we can reveal the
secret location Cedric,

09:29.569 --> 09:32.138
we have to teach you
the secret handshake.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.873
Yahooo!

09:33.873 --> 09:36.676
The secret handshake.

09:36.676 --> 09:40.813
Remember, you can't
show this to anybody.

09:40.813 --> 09:42.815
Not even to Sophia?

09:42.815 --> 09:44.951
Especially not Sophia!

09:45.985 --> 09:47.119
She's a girl!!

09:47.119 --> 09:48.921
Okay
Cedric, now watch.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.423
Kaboom-pa

09:50.423 --> 09:52.091
Po-ta-pa-ti-pa-paa

09:52.091 --> 09:54.727
Rub your belly
with linseed oil.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.430
Wrap your head in aluminum foil.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.066
Clap your hands,
stamp your feet

10:00.066 --> 10:02.702
Our secret handshake
can't be beat.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.770
Yahooo!

10:04.770 --> 10:07.473
Bravo!!
Bravo!!

10:07.473 --> 10:09.842
Now you try
it with me, Cedric.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.380
Rub your belly...

10:16.749 --> 10:18.718
Ah! Don't worry, Cedric,

10:18.718 --> 10:21.454
It takes a few times
to get the hang of it.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.256
Yeah, Bert.
It took you three years!

10:25.191 --> 10:27.660
Well, come on, let's go!

10:27.660 --> 10:31.897
♪ (triumphant music) ♪

10:31.897 --> 10:34.634
Hey, heeeyyy! There's the fort?

10:34.634 --> 10:38.437
Theeere's the fort!
Come on, let's go!

10:38.437 --> 10:40.740
Last one in is a rotten egg!

10:40.740 --> 10:42.642
That's it?!

10:42.642 --> 10:46.045
That's the fort, you guys
have been bragging about?!

10:46.045 --> 10:47.980
Well,
I guess, it does need

10:47.980 --> 10:50.182
a little work here and there.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.717
A little work?!

10:51.717 --> 10:54.153
It needs an architectural firm.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.124
Aaah, nothing a little
hammering can't fix up.

10:58.124 --> 11:01.093
Huh! We're the guys, remember?

11:01.093 --> 11:03.562
Uh, I don't
have to sleep in this

11:03.562 --> 11:05.665
broken down old thing, do I?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.466
Of course not, Cedric.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.236
Ralph and I are
sleeping in here.

11:10.236 --> 11:14.106
Yeah, but you, you're
sleeping over there.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.143
That's your initiation.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.284
Meanwhile,
as the Raccoons unpack,

11:25.284 --> 11:27.053
on the other side of the hill,

11:27.053 --> 11:29.522
Cyril Sneer was on a
forced vacation.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.589
Doctor's orders.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.767
Get those blasted birds
off my antenna!

11:41.767 --> 11:44.103
I can't get the
financial report!

11:44.103 --> 11:47.039
The Pig: But Sir, you're not
supposed to watch that.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.208
You're supposed
to get some rest.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.878
Rest?! How can I rest
with all this quiet?!

11:52.878 --> 11:55.081
This silence is
driving me crazy!

11:56.949 --> 11:59.418
If it wasn't for
those pesky Raccoons,

11:59.418 --> 12:01.387
I'd be a well man today!

12:01.387 --> 12:04.423
The Pig: Now, calm down, Sir.
Remember what the doctor said,

12:04.423 --> 12:06.492
'Don't even think about them!'

12:06.492 --> 12:07.860
Ugh!

12:07.860 --> 12:11.697
Don't worry about me.
I'm steady as a rock!

12:15.034 --> 12:19.071
Boy, this unpacking
sure works up an appetite.

else?

Yahoooo!

12:32.585 --> 12:34.687
Let me at 'em!

12:34.687 --> 12:37.089
That's it? Just beans?

12:37.089 --> 12:39.558
I can see
you've got a lot to learn

12:39.558 --> 12:42.595
about roughing it with the boys.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.764
Who's got the can opener?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.565

you packed it.

Aah, we don't
need a can opener.

just use it rock.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.730

Now, that's a good idea!

14:17.189 --> 14:19.959
Of course I want you to check
it out, you nincompoops!

you that fancy salary?

never been paid!
