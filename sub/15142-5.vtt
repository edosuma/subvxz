Okay, you guys, keep going,

Where are you guys?

11:49.126 --> 11:50.328
Good job!

11:50.328 --> 11:53.067
I wanna see you rehearsing.
Keep going.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.370

You wanna ask me out?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.830
Oh, sorry, I don’t move
that fast.

12:17.418 --> 12:19.655
He’s screwed.
Or he will be in prison.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.059
It was only 10 kilos.

12:21.059 --> 12:22.896
Okay, then. Stick with
your public defender.

12:22.896 --> 12:24.232
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

12:24.232 --> 12:26.069

your uncle.

you wanted me for my body.

12:28.273 --> 12:30.344

Well, that too.

Hey.

12:38.661 --> 12:40.098
Listen.

12:40.098 --> 12:42.035
Sorry I snapped at you.

12:42.035 --> 12:45.041
I was just stressed ’cause I had
to get something checked out.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.914
So do you have gonorrhea?
What?

12:47.914 --> 12:50.286
Tiff told me--
Okay, did Tiff tell you

12:50.286 --> 12:54.060
that it came out negative?
Because I made Diego bag it.

12:54.060 --> 12:57.700
You were smart.
I wound up with an STI

12:57.700 --> 12:59.772
’cause my first girl
didn’t love condoms, but...

12:59.772 --> 13:05.049
she did love Cris,
Rick, Victor, Chi Moi--

13:05.049 --> 13:07.354
Are you okay now?

13:07.354 --> 13:08.957
Well, my penis fell off.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.164
But thank God for superglue.

13:12.164 --> 13:13.867

He scares people.

You scare people, dude.
Shut up, and listen to Jesus.

16:11.533 --> 16:13.236
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

16:13.236 --> 16:16.376
since the vehicle was stolen,
there’s reasonable doubt

16:16.376 --> 16:19.015
the drugs actually belonged
to Mr. Nicolas Reyes.

16:19.015 --> 16:20.417
How would he know
that they were there?

16:20.417 --> 16:22.456
Especially since they were in
a hidden compartment.

16:22.456 --> 16:24.360
There’s only one choice.

16:24.360 --> 16:28.067
You must declare
this young man innocent.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.538

16:30.538 --> 16:33.344
Wow, he is good.

16:33.344 --> 16:35.515

nothing you can’t do.

16:38.087 --> 16:39.691

No. No, I don’t trust her, man.
What if she talks?

21:18.732 --> 21:20.268
She won’t.

21:20.268 --> 21:21.871
She’s doing this
to keep her boy safe.

21:21.871 --> 21:23.609
And you believe her?

( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

21:25.279 --> 21:28.485
What if this is a set up,
and she narc’d us out?

21:28.485 --> 21:29.821
You know what to do.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.278
( <i>suspenseful theme continues</i> )

21:43.383 --> 21:45.286
( car engine revs )

21:49.863 --> 21:51.265
JESUS:
Get in!

21:51.967 --> 21:53.637
No.

21:58.781 --> 22:00.618
JESUS:
Camila!

22:00.618 --> 22:03.390
I said, get in.
