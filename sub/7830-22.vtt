Oh, my goodness!

01:31.966 --> 01:34.928
Kids! Homer!
We're late for church!

01:35.011 --> 01:36.971
I'm glad I dressed
last night.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.932
Oh, I'd love to go
with you, honey,

01:39.015 --> 01:41.226
but I got a lot of work
to do around the bed.

01:41.309 --> 01:44.604
Homer, the Lord only asks
for an hour a week.

01:44.687 --> 01:45.980
In that case,

01:46.064 --> 01:47.357
he should've made
the week an hour longer.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.609
-Lousy God.
-(groaning)

01:49.692 --> 01:53.071
...and the very same
goes for Ezekiel.

01:53.154 --> 01:56.658
Which brings us back
to our starting point:

01:56.741 --> 01:59.327
The nine tenets
of constancy.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.456
Damn it!

02:03.540 --> 02:05.250
(clears throat)

02:05.333 --> 02:08.128
Well, I seem to have
lost my place...

02:08.211 --> 02:09.504
so I'll start over.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.548
MAN: Aw, for the love
of crumb cake...

02:11.631 --> 02:15.301
Our sermon today
is on constancy.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.553
In as much as the...

02:16.636 --> 02:19.472
moreover, by dint
of our application

02:19.556 --> 02:21.641
of these principles,
we can learn...

02:21.724 --> 02:24.561
...the auspices of constancy

02:24.644 --> 02:27.355
sweet constancy.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.399
(all snoring)

02:32.694 --> 02:33.820
(bird shrieking)

02:36.573 --> 02:37.448
Hey... wha...?

02:39.534 --> 02:40.493
-Yay!
-Oh, man!

02:40.577 --> 02:43.413
Am I glad to get
out of there!

02:43.496 --> 02:44.831
Hey, calm down--

02:44.914 --> 02:46.708
you're wrinkling
your church clothes.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.210
Who cares? This is
the best part of the week.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.796
It's the longest possible time
before more church!

02:51.880 --> 02:53.590
Church shouldn't be
a chore.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.383
It should help you
in your daily life.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.718
It should,
but it doesn't.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.553
Now, who's going with Daddy
to the dump?

02:58.636 --> 03:00.680
-BOTH: Me!
-The dump?

03:00.763 --> 03:02.390
We're going to get rid
of the Christmas tree.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.766
It's starting
to turn brown.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.603
-Want to come with?
-No, no,

03:06.686 --> 03:08.688
I don't feel like
going to a trash pile today.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.148
It's your life.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.233
We'll bring you back
something nice.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.945
(humming)

03:17.697 --> 03:19.240
Can you believe it?

03:19.324 --> 03:22.118
They give you five Q's
and only two U's.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.203
What a world.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.996
It's crazy.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.415
So, what's on
your mind, Marge?

03:27.498 --> 03:29.709
Sermons about constancy
and prudissitude

03:29.792 --> 03:31.586
are all very well and good,

03:31.669 --> 03:34.088
but the church could be
doing so much more

03:34.172 --> 03:36.049
to reach out to people.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.010
Oh, I don't see you volunteering
to make things better.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.595
Well...

03:40.678 --> 03:43.681
Okay, I will volunteer.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.682
I wasn't prepared for that.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.020
(grunting)

03:52.065 --> 03:54.943
Come on, Christmas tree...

03:55.026 --> 03:56.110
(grunting)

03:57.862 --> 03:59.489
(coughing)

04:01.032 --> 04:03.660
Okay, who's up
for some scrounging?

04:06.996 --> 04:09.999
Hey! Here's a perfectly good
basketball half!

04:10.083 --> 04:12.835
I found a Malibu Stacy
with no head.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.045
(screeching)

04:14.128 --> 04:15.088
(screaming)

04:15.171 --> 04:17.799
(laughing)

04:17.882 --> 04:19.092
(screaming)

04:19.175 --> 04:20.426
Oh, my God!
Help me, Lisa!

04:20.510 --> 04:22.971
BART: Lisa, Dad--
come here quick!

04:23.054 --> 04:24.722
There is something
that you won't believe!

04:27.308 --> 04:28.977
What the heck is that?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.812
BART: Maybe it's a box
from the future.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.981
LISA:
It looks Japanese.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.984
Wha-- What's going on?

04:36.067 --> 04:39.320
Why-- Why am I on
a Japanese box?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.905
(high-pitched whimpering)

04:40.989 --> 04:44.575
Oh, my God...
what is that?

04:44.659 --> 04:47.161
MARGE: All done!
I swept the aisles,

04:47.245 --> 04:49.372
and put all the collection plates
in the dishwasher.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.748
Oh, and you wouldn't
believe

04:50.832 --> 04:52.959
how many dead pigeons
there were in the organ.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.836
Marge, you are
a real time-saver.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.212
Do you know,
thanks to you

04:56.296 --> 04:57.880
I've rediscovered
a form of shame

04:57.964 --> 04:59.882
that's gone unused
for 700 years?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.217
Wow...

05:01.301 --> 05:03.011
(phone rings)

05:03.094 --> 05:04.554
Lovejoy here.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.972
<i>Reverend,</i>
<i>this is Principal Skinner.</i>

05:06.055 --> 05:07.515
<i>I'm facing a crisis,</i>

05:07.598 --> 05:09.809
<i>and I didn't know</i>
<i>to whom to turn.</i>

05:09.892 --> 05:10.852
All right.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.895
<i>Mother's gone too far.</i>

05:12.979 --> 05:15.606
<i>She's put cardboard over her</i>
<i>half of the television.</i>

05:15.690 --> 05:17.233
<i>We rented</i>
<i>"Man Without A Face."</i>

05:17.317 --> 05:19.152
<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>he had a problem!</i>

05:19.235 --> 05:20.611
<i>What should I do?</i>

05:20.695 --> 05:22.947
Well, maybe you should
read your Bible.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.575
<i>Um, any particular passage?</i>

05:25.658 --> 05:27.827
Oh, it's all good.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.871
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Thanks anyway.</i>

05:29.954 --> 05:32.915
Reverend, I hate to say this,
but it sounded

05:32.999 --> 05:35.084
like that poor man
was reaching out to you.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.879
I'm not sure your advice
was all that helpful.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.256
(chuckling) Oh, Marge.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.718
I was once idealistic
like you.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.428
It was the mid '70s,

05:45.511 --> 05:47.597
and I was fresh out
of seminary.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.057
The '60s were long over

05:49.140 --> 05:50.516
and people were
once again ready

05:50.600 --> 05:53.269
to feel bad
about themselves.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.564
<i>♪ Jesus is just all right</i>
<i>with me ♪</i>

05:56.647 --> 05:58.399
LOVEJOY:
<i>I came to Springfield</i>

05:58.483 --> 06:02.111
<i>ready to roll up my sleeves</i>
<i>and help my fellow man.</i>

06:02.195 --> 06:04.864
<i>There was just one fellow man</i>
<i>I hadn't counted on.</i>

06:06.574 --> 06:07.909
Reverend, I'm--

06:07.992 --> 06:09.535
I'm afraid something
terrible has happened.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.871
Well, sit down and rap
with me, brother.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.706
That's what I'm here for.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.085
Well, I was talked into doing
a dance called "The Bump,"

06:17.168 --> 06:21.089
but my hip slipped, and my--
my buttocks came into contact

06:21.172 --> 06:24.550
with the buttocks
of another young man!

06:24.634 --> 06:27.053
I... see.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.889
<i>Then, the calls began.</i>

06:29.972 --> 06:32.975
FLANDERS: <i>Well, I-I think I may be</i>
<i>coveting my own wife.</i>

06:33.059 --> 06:36.938
<i>I'm meek, but... I could</i>
<i>probably stand to be meeker.</i>

06:37.021 --> 06:40.066
<i>I-I-I think I swallowed</i>
<i>a toothpick!</i>

06:40.149 --> 06:43.319
LOVEJOY: <i>Finally,</i>
<i>I just stopped caring.</i>

06:43.403 --> 06:45.863
<i>Luckily, by then,</i>
<i>it was the '80s</i>

06:45.947 --> 06:47.532
<i>and no one noticed.</i>

06:47.615 --> 06:50.076
But you can't
let a few bad experiences

06:50.159 --> 06:51.536
sour you on helping people.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.454
-Oh, sure I can.
-(phone rings)

06:53.538 --> 06:55.373
Ugh! You handle it.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.543
Me? No, I-- I--
Wait! I can't--

06:58.626 --> 07:00.211
Hello?

07:00.294 --> 07:02.505
Uh, yeah, hi. I'm calling
for Reverend Lovejoy.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.631
Who is this?

07:03.714 --> 07:05.091
Oh, well, this is, um...

07:05.174 --> 07:08.261
the, uh... the listen lady.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.638
Yeah? Well, listen, lady,
I've got so many problems

07:10.721 --> 07:12.849
I-I don't even know
where to begin here.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.725
Okay...

07:14.809 --> 07:17.478
uh, why don't you
start from the top?

07:17.562 --> 07:18.896
All righty.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.899
Uh, number one:
I've lost the will to live.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.110
Oh, that's
ridiculous, Moe.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.112
You've got lots
to live for.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.488
Really?
That's not what

07:27.572 --> 07:29.657
Reverend Lovejoy's
been telling me.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.702
Wow! You're good.
Thanks.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.620
(ringing)

07:34.704 --> 07:36.664
Hi. It's me again.
I got another problem.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.708
Uh, this one's
about my cat.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.626
(meowing)

07:40.710 --> 07:42.044
Yeah! Shut up!!
I'm asking her.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.217
Why would you volunteer
at the church?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.428
I don't know. Guilt?

07:50.511 --> 07:51.804
(scoffs) Volunteering
is for suckers.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.681
Do you know that
so-called "volunteers"

07:53.764 --> 07:55.641
don't even get paid?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.602
Well, I think
volunteering is great.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.437
Deep down,
it makes you feel...

07:59.520 --> 08:02.356
Homer, will get that crazy box
off the dinner table?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.733
It came from the dump.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.693
But, Marge,
I'm obsessed with it.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.279
Where did it come from?
What is it a box of?

08:08.362 --> 08:09.572
How did my face get on it?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.616
Hey, if they got
a picture of you,

08:11.699 --> 08:13.409
that means they can see you.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.328
They're probably watching us
right now.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.579
That's ridiculous.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.540
Nobody is watching us
right now.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.466
Hai! Hai! Hai! Bye.

08:28.549 --> 08:29.717
Hai!

08:29.800 --> 08:32.261
Akira, can you
read this for me?

08:32.345 --> 08:35.348
Ah, yes. This is a product
called "Mr. Sparkle."

08:35.431 --> 08:37.517
Very popular dish detergent.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.684
Hey...
he looks like you.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.895
(laughs)

08:40.978 --> 08:42.522
What's he saying?

08:42.605 --> 08:45.775
He identifies himself as
"a magnet for foodstuffs."

08:45.858 --> 08:47.735
He boasts that he will
"banish dirt

08:47.818 --> 08:49.654
to the land of wind
and ghosts."

08:49.737 --> 08:51.072
Wow!

08:51.155 --> 08:53.658
Yes. You have very lucky dishes,
Mr. Simpson.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.661
This soap is from the
sacred forest of Hokkaido,

08:56.744 --> 08:59.288
renowned for its countless
soap factories.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.415
Hokkaido, eh?

09:03.584 --> 09:05.670
See, all along,
I been telling Carl

09:05.753 --> 09:07.463
I'm married to
a beauty queen.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.382
Now, he's coming
over for dinner.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.675
Lenny, I'm sure
he'll like your wife

09:10.758 --> 09:12.385
no matter what she looks like.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.095
Oh, no, no. No.
It's worse than that.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.596
I don't even have a wife.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.849
I just said I did to,
you know, be a big-shot.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.937
Oh. Well, it's time
to start telling the truth.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.147
Now, when I have to tell
my husband the truth,

09:25.231 --> 09:28.150
I cook him a big,
delicious dinner.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.735
By the time
he's done eating

09:29.819 --> 09:32.280
he's too full and tired
to care what I have to say.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.698
Wow, that's great!

09:33.781 --> 09:35.241
When Carl comes over,
I'll stuff him

09:35.324 --> 09:36.242
till he don't know
what's what.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.289
Seymour, I'm getting tired.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.707
Tell them we're going next.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.334
Well, I'm not principal
of the line, Mother.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.086
And you never will be.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.885
I'd like the phone book
for Hokkaido, Japan, please.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.929
Okay.
Here you go.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.472
The phone book
for Hokkaido, Japan.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.725
Thank you.
May I please use your phone?

10:00.808 --> 10:02.518
Is it a local call?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.145
Y... yes.

10:11.402 --> 10:16.532
(touch tones)

10:46.437 --> 10:47.396
(phone ringing)

10:47.480 --> 10:48.814
Mooshi-mooshi?

10:48.898 --> 10:51.942
Yes. This is Homer Simpson
from America.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.653
Who may I say
is speaking to me?

10:53.736 --> 10:55.988
(speaking Japanese)

10:56.072 --> 10:58.407
Hello, chief?
Let's talk, why not?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.577
Uh, hello?
Why am I Mr. Sparkle?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.162
Oh, you like Mr. Sparkle?

11:03.245 --> 11:05.164
Well, I am Mr. Sparkle.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.957
Oh, you have
many question, Mr. Sparkle.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.503
I send you premium answer question
hundred percent.

11:10.586 --> 11:13.297
The Lord will hear
your lamentations

11:13.381 --> 11:15.508
and give solace to your spirit.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.926
The Lord or Marge Simpson!

11:17.009 --> 11:18.052
LENNY:
Amen to that.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.596
(all exclaiming)

11:20.680 --> 11:23.516
Um... could we please
not yell out things

11:23.599 --> 11:25.351
in the church?

11:25.434 --> 11:27.311
(bell ringing)

11:29.939 --> 11:32.358
(overlapping dialog)

11:32.441 --> 11:34.777
Wait a minute, please.
One at a time.

11:34.860 --> 11:35.945
One at a time!

11:36.028 --> 11:38.489
Now, who has
the most urgent problem?

11:38.572 --> 11:41.784
I have a recurring dream
in which I'm falling.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.661
Come right this way,
Mel, I--

11:43.744 --> 11:45.579
Tim, hold my calls.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.877
Mm...

11:51.961 --> 11:55.089
I'm a shepherd
without a flock.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.508
What have I done
to lose them?

11:59.927 --> 12:01.470
<i>The real question is</i>

12:01.554 --> 12:03.180
<i>"what have you done</i>
<i>to keep them?"</i>

12:03.264 --> 12:04.223
(gasps)

12:04.306 --> 12:06.100
St. Eleutherius of Nicomedia.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.977
<i>That's my name,</i>
<i>don't wear it out.</i>

12:08.060 --> 12:10.146
<i>To inspire men,</i>
<i>you must be brave.</i>

12:10.229 --> 12:13.065
<i>I introduced Christianity </i>
<i>to Mongolia.</i>

12:13.149 --> 12:15.067
<i>It didn't take,</i>
<i>but it was worth a try.</i>

12:15.151 --> 12:17.069
<i>Tell us, good reverend,</i>

12:17.153 --> 12:18.738
<i>what great deeds</i>
<i>have you done</i>

12:18.821 --> 12:20.489
<i>to inspire</i>
<i>the hearts of men?</i>

12:20.573 --> 12:25.119
Well, I had the vestibule
re-carpeted.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.037
<i>I've appeared</i>
<i>in over 8,000 visions</i>

12:27.121 --> 12:29.957
<i>and that's the lamest reply</i>
<i>I've ever heard.</i>

12:30.040 --> 12:31.584
Oh, now, please, I--

12:31.667 --> 12:34.044
I thought saints
were supposed to be friendly.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.797
<i>Oh, you're just lucky</i>
<i>God isn't here.</i>

12:41.802 --> 12:43.345
(phone ringing)

12:43.429 --> 12:44.722
Hello. Listen Lady.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.057
Marge, people say
you've got a real knack

12:47.141 --> 12:48.893
for solving problems.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.770
Well... this is
a little awkward

12:50.853 --> 12:52.980
but, um, Tim came home
from church

12:53.063 --> 12:54.774
so despondent today,

12:54.857 --> 12:57.777
he's just been playing with
his trains all afternoon.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.987
We all need a little time
to ourselves, Helen.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.781
Just give him a day or two

13:01.864 --> 13:04.742
and I'm sure he'll be back
to his old dynamic self.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.327
Okay.

13:07.703 --> 13:11.040
Attention,
H-O scale passengers:

13:11.123 --> 13:13.667
The dining car is closed.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.669
Root beer is still available,

13:15.753 --> 13:18.672
but the cost is now $6.50.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.300
If the passengers
will look to the right

13:21.383 --> 13:24.303
you will see a sad man.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.180
That is all.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.516
Look, we got a package

13:28.599 --> 13:30.851
from the Mr. Sparkle
company in Japan.

13:30.935 --> 13:31.852
Ooh!

13:36.065 --> 13:37.024
Ow!

13:37.107 --> 13:38.859
It's a videotape.

13:38.943 --> 13:39.985
Put it in! Put it in!

13:46.283 --> 13:50.663
<i>Oh, hello,</i>

13:50.746 --> 13:54.166

15:06.363 --> 15:08.282
Boring!

15:08.365 --> 15:10.200
That didn't
explain anything.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.077
All I know is
they stole my face

15:12.161 --> 15:14.705
and used it
for their stupid logo.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.540
There's no other explanation.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.875
Wait, look.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.293
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Mr. Sparkle,</i>

15:19.376 --> 15:22.338
<i>a joint venture</i>
<i>of Matsumura Fishworks,</i>

15:22.421 --> 15:25.883
<i>and Tamaribuchi</i>
<i>Heavy Manufacturing Concern.</i>

15:30.679 --> 15:33.265
Hey, it was all
a coincidence.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.559
Yep. There's your answer,
fish bulb.

15:35.643 --> 15:39.104
Well, it was a good
ride while it lasted.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.148
Come on, kids,
let's go home.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.191
We are home.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.943
That was fast.

15:44.026 --> 15:48.656
You've just got to accept it.
Your Gameboy is gone.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.574
It's at the bottom
of the ocean.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.410
Aye, aye.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.787
Aye.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.665
(phone rings)

15:57.748 --> 15:59.166
Hello. Listen Lady.

15:59.249 --> 16:03.128
Uh... I'm in some
hot soup here, Marge.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.381
Some teenagers are hanging out
in front of the store.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.342
I-I think they could start
slacking at any moment.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.678
Well, Ned, you don't have
to stand for that.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.680
You just march
right up to those youngsters

16:12.763 --> 16:14.139
and tell them to vamoose.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.724
Yeah, well...

16:15.808 --> 16:17.643
if you're sure
that will help...

16:17.726 --> 16:20.396
Hey, let's go over
to the one-hour photo

16:20.479 --> 16:21.939
and breathe some fumes.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.315
Uh, excuse me, fellas.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.359
I couldn't help thinking
it might be nice

16:25.442 --> 16:27.319
if you could, uh,
vamoose, you know?

16:27.403 --> 16:29.113
(nervous chuckle)
If possible.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.158
(phone ringing)

16:33.242 --> 16:34.618
Hello. Listen Lady.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.287
Uh... Marge I-I appreciate
your advice

16:37.371 --> 16:39.289
but, uh, things have gotten--
(chuckles)

16:39.373 --> 16:41.500
Well, they-they're, uh,
a lot worse.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.085
(ominous laughter)

16:47.589 --> 16:50.634
Now, Ned, troubled boys
need rules and discipline.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.177
They crave it!

16:52.261 --> 16:53.762
You just lay down the law.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.432
Well, yeah, I know,
but they--

16:56.515 --> 16:58.350
They're on their mini-bikes
and all.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.394
Oh, all right,
let me talk to them.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.854
Put me on with the lead boy.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.357
Boys, there's a call here
for you.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.942
(dial tone)

17:07.026 --> 17:09.862
Hmm. Oh, well.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.321
(water gurgles)

17:13.532 --> 17:15.034
(doorbell rings)

17:16.452 --> 17:18.203
Oh, good morning, Maude.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.663
Morning, Marge.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.999
Um, did your husband
come home last night?

17:22.082 --> 17:23.042
Of course he did.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.002
Really? Oh...

17:25.085 --> 17:27.463
because the thing is, um...

17:27.546 --> 17:28.672
mine didn't.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.050
(gasps)
Oh, my God, Ned!

17:31.133 --> 17:32.718
(gasping)

17:39.892 --> 17:41.185
Yes, Marge?

17:41.268 --> 17:44.480
Reverend, I gave Ned Flanders
some bad advice.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.274
Now he could be
in real trouble.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.609
(groaning)
What happened now?

17:48.692 --> 17:50.444
Did he swallow a paper clip?

17:50.527 --> 17:52.488
No. He's disappeared.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.074
Oh, I'm in way over my head.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.533
I mean, where do
the helpers turn

17:56.617 --> 17:57.659
when they
need help?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.037
<i>♪♪ (organ)</i>

18:03.957 --> 18:04.958
Sorry.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.335
(phone rings)

18:06.418 --> 18:09.338
Marge, why don't you
let me handle this?

18:09.421 --> 18:10.464
(ringing)

18:10.547 --> 18:12.049
Hello? Church basement.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.885
(panting)
Yeah, it's Ned Flanders.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.096
The teens have been
chasing me all night.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.349
They-They finally stopped
to gas up their scooters.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.767
Ned! Where are you?!

18:21.850 --> 18:23.727
Well, I can't see
the name of the station

18:23.811 --> 18:27.564
but the gas costs 1.49
and 8/10.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.483
Eight tenths?

18:29.566 --> 18:30.943
Donny's Discount Gas!

18:32.069 --> 18:33.529
(tires screeching)

18:33.612 --> 18:35.114
Thanks for swinging by
the house, Reverend.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.406
-Donny?
-What?

18:36.490 --> 18:37.574
Did you see a man
being chased

18:37.658 --> 18:39.284
by some young
hooligans?

18:39.368 --> 18:40.661
I see lots of stuff.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.121
Did you see that?

18:42.204 --> 18:43.247
Yes.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.712
Huh. Looks like
we lost him.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.589
Yeah. Well, we proved
our point.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.049
He'll think twice

18:54.133 --> 18:56.927
next time he tries to defend
his business.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.096
(yawning)
I'm sleepy.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.097
Let's go to school.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.728
(sighs)
They're leaving.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.355
The ordeal is over.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.523
(screeching)

19:09.606 --> 19:10.691
(screaming)

19:10.774 --> 19:11.859
Ned!

19:11.942 --> 19:12.943
-Mr. Flanders!
-Mr. Flanders!

19:13.026 --> 19:14.903
Flanders, where
are you?!

19:14.987 --> 19:16.321
(all yelling)

19:16.405 --> 19:18.657
Hey, Flanders, it's me!

19:18.740 --> 19:21.243
Heh Mr. Sparkaru!
Mr. Sparkaru!

19:21.326 --> 19:22.703
<i>Konnichi-wa.</i>

19:22.786 --> 19:24.163
(Flanders screaming)

19:24.246 --> 19:26.456

19:26.540 --> 19:29.668
(gasps) That came from
Baboon County, USA!

19:32.796 --> 19:34.590
Help! What do I do?!

19:34.673 --> 19:35.716
Play dead!

19:35.799 --> 19:37.134
No! Run around in circles!

19:37.217 --> 19:38.844
No! Act like a lion!

19:38.927 --> 19:40.679
Swipe at the dominant male!

19:40.762 --> 19:42.764
Come on, Ned!
Knock that monkey down!

19:42.848 --> 19:44.850
Jumpin' kangaroo rats!

19:48.645 --> 19:50.230
You've got to get
him out of there.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.732
Geez, I'd like to,

19:51.815 --> 19:53.233
but if they don't
kill the intruder

19:53.317 --> 19:55.235
it's really bad
for their society.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.279
-They're going to kill him?
-Eventually.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.780
First, they'll
eat his skin.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.574
-(gasping)
-Eww.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.705
Tell Maude I want
a fancy funeral!

20:06.788 --> 20:08.624
Big coffin! Lots of jewels!

20:08.707 --> 20:11.501
(whistle blows)

20:15.923 --> 20:18.258
Look!
It's Reverend Lovejoy!

20:18.342 --> 20:20.385
Thank heavens!

20:20.469 --> 20:22.638
Entrust your hand to mine, Ned.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.477
(groaning)

20:28.560 --> 20:30.604
(howling and screeching)

20:30.687 --> 20:32.856
Oh! Oh--

20:32.940 --> 20:34.316
Thank the Lord.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.984
He's truly watching
over--

20:36.068 --> 20:38.028
-(screaming)
-(screeching)

20:38.111 --> 20:41.698
Say your prayers,
you heathen baboons!

20:41.782 --> 20:42.741
(grunting)

20:57.673 --> 20:58.715
Wow.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.634
Oh! Those
poor monkeys.

21:00.717 --> 21:01.718
They started it.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.303
(gasping)

21:03.387 --> 21:05.097
You saved me,
Reverend.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.516
You really went
above and beyond.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.850
Thank you.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.728
Oh, don't thank me.
Thank Marge Simpson.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.731
She taught me that there's
more to being a minister

21:14.815 --> 21:16.858
than not caring
about people.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.026
(chuckling)

21:18.110 --> 21:19.444
Amen!

21:21.947 --> 21:24.658
(baboons screeching)

21:27.786 --> 21:30.872
...baboons to the left of me,
baboons to the right,

21:30.956 --> 21:32.582
the speeding locomotive
tore through

21:32.666 --> 21:35.043
a sea of inhuman fangs.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.255
A pair of the great apes
rose up at me, but biff-bam!

21:38.338 --> 21:42.050
I sent them flying
like two hairy footballs.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.511
A third came screaming at me--

21:44.594 --> 21:47.055
(imitating baboon hissing)

21:47.139 --> 21:48.932
And that's when I got mad.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.809
Now that's religion!
