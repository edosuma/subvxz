for your first day!

10:20.161 --> 10:21.579
- I can't stand it.
- (embarrassed laugh)

10:21.579 --> 10:24.332
Okay, let me just get
one more picture, okay?

10:24.332 --> 10:25.833
You pose right here.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.422
(sniffles) One second.
Let me get this thing open.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.468
- Alright, ready?
- Okay.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.886
- Smile!
- (shutter snaps)

10:36.886 --> 10:39.472
- (squeals) So cute.
- Hey, send it to Dad.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.641
Okay, yeah.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.894
- Actually, no, you could just--
- Oh, no, no, it's fine.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.104
- I'll send it to him.
- No, send it to me.
I can send it to him.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.690
- Nope. Already sent.
- (text whooshes)

10:49.690 --> 10:51.359
(giggles) Easy.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.861
- Not a big deal. (laughs)
- Okay.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.738
Alright.
Let me get it together.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.782
Should we go?
You ready?

10:57.782 --> 10:59.617
- Yeah, I guess.
- (laughs)

10:59.617 --> 11:01.535
- I'm not ready, but.
- Yeah.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.371
- Should we get a coffee first?
- We'll get coffee.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.123
Okay. (sighs)

11:09.543 --> 11:10.628
(sighs)

11:21.514 --> 11:22.598
(sniffles)

11:27.144 --> 11:28.229
(sighs)

11:29.647 --> 11:32.316
(phone rings, line connects)

11:32.316 --> 11:34.068
- Joel (on phone): <i>Hey!</i>
- Hey.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.570
Joel:
<i>Well, I think I finally
got the shit smell out.</i>

11:36.570 --> 11:39.490
<i>You can maybe smell it,
but you have to really,
really try.</i>

11:39.490 --> 11:42.410
<i>How's it going up there?
You ready for the renters?</i>

11:42.410 --> 11:44.662
Yeah, I'm getting there.
(weak laugh)

11:47.665 --> 11:49.333
Joel:
<i>You okay?</i>

11:50.376 --> 11:52.002
No.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.966
Just, um...

11:58.217 --> 12:00.302
feels really weird
to be here

12:00.302 --> 12:02.596
with all of his stuff,
you know?

12:04.932 --> 12:07.101
I...

12:07.101 --> 12:10.479
I mean, I wanted him to go,
and I pushed him to go,
and I'm...

12:10.479 --> 12:12.106
and I'm glad he went
because I know

12:12.106 --> 12:13.691
that he couldn't have
cleaned out this barn.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.443
It would've broken his heart.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.573
But, I didn't... (sighs)

12:22.533 --> 12:25.536
I didn't know it'd
break mine, and, um...

12:29.498 --> 12:31.709
Just sitting here,
Joel, and he...

12:34.587 --> 12:36.380
he's everywhere.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.845
Every inch
of this place is...

12:42.845 --> 12:44.805
him, you know?

12:48.267 --> 12:50.936
He loved this place.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.814
And now, I'm just...

12:55.232 --> 12:58.486
I just feel like
I'm packing up his whole life,

12:58.486 --> 13:00.070
and, um...

13:04.033 --> 13:05.784
God (sniffles)...

13:06.702 --> 13:09.955
Yeah, it just-- just sucks.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.041
Joel:
<i>Do you want me
to come out there?</i>

13:13.417 --> 13:15.711
(inhales, exhales)

13:15.711 --> 13:17.713
No, just, um...

13:19.798 --> 13:21.967
just sit with me for a minute.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.430
Joel:
<i>Okay.</i>

13:37.608 --> 13:40.236
(soft crying)

13:44.240 --> 13:45.950
(sniffles, sighs)

13:45.950 --> 13:48.452
Maybe I'm just
a little tired. (laughs)

13:48.452 --> 13:50.371
(both laugh softly)

13:50.371 --> 13:52.373
(sniffles) I don't know.

13:52.373 --> 13:56.168
You know, facing
all this family shit
without a cocktail.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.421
Joel:
<i>I can be out there with
a shaker in 15 minutes.</i>

13:59.421 --> 14:01.382
(laughs) No, no, no.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.093
(sniffles) No. No.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.263
Thank you.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.600
(inhales, exhales)

14:11.600 --> 14:14.478
Joel:
<i>You're doing good by him.
You really are.</i>

14:15.271 --> 14:16.605
Thank you.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.734
(birds chirping)

14:38.919 --> 14:43.007
Oh, my fucking... God!

14:44.216 --> 14:45.342
(exhales sharply)

14:48.053 --> 14:49.722
(engine revs)

14:51.599 --> 14:52.683
(sighs)

14:54.768 --> 14:56.437
(door creaks open)

15:17.541 --> 15:20.669
(keys jangle)

15:27.926 --> 15:31.847
(walking down hall)

15:31.847 --> 15:34.516
(bird cawing)

15:34.516 --> 15:36.185
(quiet chatter)

15:36.185 --> 15:37.603
Hi.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.899
Um, Mary Jo Miller?

15:41.899 --> 15:44.026
Oh, I'm sure you've got stories.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.653
Yeah. Is she in her room?

15:45.653 --> 15:47.946
- Yeah. You'll hear her.
- Thanks.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.870
- (quiet chatter)
- (resident coughing)

16:12.638 --> 16:14.682
Oh! Didn't see you there.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.226
- MJ, you have a visitor.
- (shuts drawer)

16:17.226 --> 16:20.562
Hey, Mom! I was worried
I was gonna miss you.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.022
What are you doing here?

16:22.022 --> 16:24.733
Well, I wanted to visit you,
and Dad wanted to make sure

16:24.733 --> 16:26.193
that you have plenty
of clean underwear,

16:26.193 --> 16:27.194
so there's some in the drawer,

16:27.194 --> 16:28.529
and I put a little up here,
too, okay?

16:28.529 --> 16:30.572
That shithead
burnt my house down.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.366
No, Mom. (laughs)
No, he didn't.

16:32.366 --> 16:36.453
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.164
Have... Have you been smoking?

16:39.164 --> 16:41.041
Has she been smoking?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.669
- Nothing we can do about it.
- What are you doing, Mom?

16:43.669 --> 16:46.171
You don't smoke.
What's that about?

16:46.171 --> 16:48.090
(slaps thigh)

16:48.090 --> 16:50.384
(sighs) Okay.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.761
Is there anything else
I can bring for you tomorrow?

16:52.761 --> 16:55.097
- No.
- Okay.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.475
- Well, I'll see you
tomorrow, and just...
- (wheelchair rattling)

16:58.475 --> 17:00.644
You know, thank you.
I guess.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.187
(phone ringing)

17:02.187 --> 17:03.981
Hey, college mama.
How'd it go?

17:03.981 --> 17:06.024
Tricia (on phone):
<i>Yeah, so do you
and your buffer</i>

17:06.024 --> 17:07.401
<i>want to come over
for dinner?</i>

17:07.401 --> 17:08.819
<i>I made this--
way too much food.</i>

17:08.819 --> 17:10.404
<i>Casseroles.
I don't know. I'm just--</i>

17:10.404 --> 17:13.073
<i>- I'm not used to
cooking for one.</i>
- Yeah, I'll check with him.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.534
By the way, you owe me.
I just saw Mom.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.703
- Jesus Christ.
- (doorbell rings)

17:17.703 --> 17:19.872
We are leaving as soon
as we finish eating.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.166
Copy that.
What's our safe word?

17:22.166 --> 17:23.751
- Tricia!
- Hello!

17:23.751 --> 17:26.420
- Hey.
- Tricia: Come on in.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.714
- "Juicy."
- Joel: "Juicy."

17:28.714 --> 17:32.176
(laughs) This is fun.
Thank you for having us.

17:32.176 --> 17:36.555
Oh no! I'm so glad
you came. And Joel...

17:36.555 --> 17:39.725
I mean, have to give you
a little compliment.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.020
- You almost make
Sam fun. Almost.
- (Sam laughs)

17:43.020 --> 17:44.563
- Thanks. (laughs)
- Thanks...

17:44.563 --> 17:46.774
So, of course, I've been
wondering and thinking

17:46.774 --> 17:48.233
about what this day
was gonna be like,

17:48.233 --> 17:50.944
and it was nothing
like I thought it would be.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.821
He wasn't even there.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.617
Well, I know there are
mixed emotions,
but, you know,

17:56.617 --> 17:58.243
you should feel
proud of yourself.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.745
You raised a really
wonderful young woman.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.622
Thank you. (soft laugh)

18:01.622 --> 18:04.666
You know, I've never really
been alone, like, not ever.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.335
I mean, this is it for me.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.337
I mean, you get
divorced at my age,

18:08.337 --> 18:10.088
that is the end. Done.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.840
I'll be alone forever,
and, you know, that's fine.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.426
It's not a big deal.
But, Sam, you've
always been alone.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.638
I mean, you're good at it
or used to it or whatever.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.473
It's fine for you,
and that's fine.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.017
I just never thought that
I would end up like this.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.685
Just never saw it.

18:23.685 --> 18:27.105
Thought I'd be more like
Mom and Dad,
like married forever.

18:27.105 --> 18:29.024
- Really?
- Tricia: Mm-hmm!

18:29.024 --> 18:31.485
- Heck yeah.
- Get treated like shit
and fuckin'

18:31.485 --> 18:33.737
taken for granted like Dad?

18:34.613 --> 18:36.240
Mm, just...

18:37.616 --> 18:39.743
I don't wanna be
a divorced person.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.955
I don't... I'm not a div--

18:42.955 --> 18:45.666
I'm not the kind of person
who gets divorced.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.875
I don't...

18:47.793 --> 18:49.044
Well, you don't have to be.

18:49.044 --> 18:52.256
You could get back
together with Rick.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.049
(scoffs) Joel, he cheated.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.343
Or not. Or not.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.846
Tricia:
Well...

18:58.846 --> 19:00.722
Maybe I cheated, too.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.807
- (fork clanks)
- No, you didn't!

19:01.807 --> 19:03.308
You did?

19:03.308 --> 19:06.228
Well, I guess not technically,

19:06.228 --> 19:08.355
but, I mean, I did try.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.859
- (excited giggle)
- What are you talking about?

19:11.859 --> 19:14.194
(coyly):
Uh-hm.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.822
- I think I need more details.
- I'd like a few more myself.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.740
- Joel: I wanna know.
- With Coop.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.659
- No!
- (Joel giggles)

19:20.659 --> 19:22.119
Yes!

19:22.119 --> 19:24.204
Well, she fucked my husband,

19:24.204 --> 19:27.040
- so I tried to fuck hers.
- Sam: Tricia!

19:27.040 --> 19:29.459
- Tricia: Hm?
- Now who's fun?

19:29.459 --> 19:31.587
- I was so mad.
He turned me down, so...
- Sam: Wha...

19:31.587 --> 19:34.089
- Okay, th-then it
doesn't really count.
- Tricia: Coop.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.591
Okay? Coop.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.927
Coop said no to this,
this whole situation.

19:38.927 --> 19:41.555
He was like, "No thanks."
I'm like, "What the fuck?

19:41.555 --> 19:44.016
- Wh-who are you again?"
- (Joel laughs)

19:44.016 --> 19:46.810
Do you know what
a pencil test is, Joel?

19:46.810 --> 19:49.104
- Oh, here we go.
- Tricia: Okay. Pencil test.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.689
Do you wanna say it
or you want me to say it?

19:50.689 --> 19:52.524
- I guess you?
- Okay, I'll say it.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.568
- Joel: You can say it.
- Pencil test is if it stays--

19:54.568 --> 19:56.653
You put it under here,
and if it stays...

19:56.653 --> 19:58.196
- Anyway, it's good if it falls.
- (clatters)

19:58.196 --> 20:01.867
- Oh! (laughs) Well, it did!
- Tricia: That was loud. Sorry!

20:01.867 --> 20:04.912
So, I pass the pencil test
even still.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.872
Even at my age.
Do you see it?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.582
What do you think?

20:08.582 --> 20:10.250
Joel, just tell her
she has great tits.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.835
Say it. You're not
even looking at 'em.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.714
- You have great tits.
- (Tricia yelps, giggles)

20:15.714 --> 20:18.342
- Why would you make me say that?
- 'Cause I wanted to hear it.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.052
- (both giggling)
- Joel: Oh, my God.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.637
That did not sound good
coming outta my mouth.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.388
It was a little bit weird,
but I feel much better.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.681
Who wants more wine?

20:24.681 --> 20:26.934
I would like to know how
you feel about my tits, Joel.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.143
(laughs)

20:28.143 --> 20:29.603
- You know how--
- Just look at 'em.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.897
You know how
a mother can't love...

20:31.897 --> 20:34.942
- more-- her children
more than the other?
- Whose do you like better?

20:34.942 --> 20:36.777
- If you had to pick?
- You know, it's equal love.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.612
- It's equal love.
- Do you like
the pencil test pass,

20:38.612 --> 20:41.698
- or would you rather--
- Or what about the salad--

20:41.698 --> 20:43.867
(all laughing)

20:43.867 --> 20:47.287
If I don't win now,
you fucker.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.456
(shaking, rattling)

20:49.456 --> 20:51.083
Is that what I think it is?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.001
(gasps)

20:53.001 --> 20:55.128
♪ I love a teenie-tini,
would you like a teenie-tini? ♪

20:55.128 --> 20:56.672
♪ I'd like a teenie-tini, too ♪

20:56.672 --> 20:58.840
♪ That's one teenie-tini,
and another teenie-tini ♪

20:58.840 --> 21:02.135
- Joel: Ooh!
- (both laugh)

21:04.930 --> 21:07.391
I guess it'll be
a teenier-tini.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.018
- That's okay. I'll take
whatever you got.
- (laughing)

21:10.018 --> 21:13.188
Oh, we've earned it
after that dinner.
Oh, my God.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.565
(both laugh)

21:15.565 --> 21:17.609
- Okay. Okay. Oh.
- (sighs)

21:17.609 --> 21:20.195
I guess one shouldn't
mix drinks

21:20.195 --> 21:22.531
- when under the influence.
- (laughing)

21:22.531 --> 21:25.826
- Cheers. Thank you
for this. Cheers.
- (laughing) Cheers!

21:26.493 --> 21:27.661
Mm!

21:27.661 --> 21:30.664
Oh God. Tricia's a lot.
(laughs)

21:30.664 --> 21:32.165
(laughing)

21:32.165 --> 21:34.876
Mm! Oh, my God,
how is your mom?

21:34.876 --> 21:38.338
- Oh, she was wonderful.
Thank you so much for asking.
- Aww.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.674
Was it just a real shit show?

21:40.674 --> 21:43.135
It was a shit show.
Do you know
what she's doing now?

21:43.135 --> 21:45.971
- Hm?
- She is bumming cigarettes
off of her fellow residents.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.556
(laughs) Well, sure.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.599
- She's a stroke victim.
Why wouldn't she?
- Yes!

21:49.599 --> 21:51.476
I think she would
like another stroke.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.687
- (laughs)
- (laughs) Oh no. Sorry.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.855
But you can't tell her
what to do!

21:54.855 --> 21:56.440
She just does whatever
the fuck she wants.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.400
I wouldn't even go visit her
if it weren't for my dad,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.027
but, you know, fuck.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.195
Ugh. You know what?

22:02.195 --> 22:04.698
- Hm?
- I think what
you need is 30 CCs

22:04.698 --> 22:06.533
of Joel on your next visit.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.536
- (laughs)
- I am a very charming companion!

22:09.536 --> 22:12.372
Joel, I will not stand by
while my mother's a cunt to you.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.666
(laughs)

22:14.666 --> 22:17.044
I'm sorry, but she cunt
help herself. (laughs)

22:17.044 --> 22:19.087
(laughs)

22:20.130 --> 22:21.298
I like gettin' lit.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.426
(both laugh)

22:24.426 --> 22:27.179
- Cheers! Oh, my God.
- (glasses clink)

22:27.179 --> 22:28.764
- Fred: Here he is!
- Oh, my God!

22:28.764 --> 22:30.348
- Sam: Jesus Christ!
- Hi, kids!

22:30.348 --> 22:32.434
- I've missed you. How are you?
- (door shuts)

22:32.434 --> 22:34.895
- What are you doing here?
- Her pops called me.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.605
- What, he did?
- Fred: Yeah, he did.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.398
But you know what?
He just wanted to make sure

22:38.398 --> 22:40.275
that you're doing okay
and everything's okay
at the farm.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.235
- Okay.
- Fred: And you know what?
I gotta tell you, kids.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.488
I was getting a little cold
and bored up there in--

22:44.488 --> 22:47.074
thank you--
in Wisconsin, you know?

22:47.074 --> 22:48.950
- So, it was time to come home.
- Well, welcome back.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.702
- Thank you.
- Sam: Welcome back.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.121
Jesus, Sammy!
Oh my God,

22:53.121 --> 22:55.665
- is this what it's come down to?
- (laughs)

22:55.665 --> 22:57.042
It's a little
fluffy under there.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.960
It's like an Ewok's
on your lap.
You see that?

22:58.960 --> 23:01.379
- You see that?
- Yeah, well,
I'm a child of the '70s,

23:01.379 --> 23:03.715
and my bush should be
a reflection of that.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.133
- (Joel laughs)
- Oh, how I missed you two.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.385
- Is it that bad?
- It's kinda bad.

23:07.385 --> 23:10.222
I'm so glad I finally get
to see the honeymoon suite.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.307
It's solely
a financial arrangement.

23:12.307 --> 23:15.310
- A little marriage of
convenience. I get a cut.
- (laughter)

23:15.310 --> 23:18.105
So, I don't understand.
My dad will call you,

23:18.105 --> 23:19.147
but not his own daughters?

23:19.147 --> 23:20.440
Well, he doesn't
want you to think

23:20.440 --> 23:22.442
he's being overbearing
or micromanaging.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.944
Okay, so he sent you?

23:23.944 --> 23:26.154
Yeah. I'm the full package.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.572
(scoffs)

23:27.572 --> 23:29.991
Can you do that?
Can you just
leave a sabbatical?

23:29.991 --> 23:32.786
It's, like, a really big deal
for you and your career, right?

23:32.786 --> 23:35.080
Look, kids,
nine months was enough,

23:35.080 --> 23:36.957
and I can finish
my research here.

23:36.957 --> 23:40.502
Well... Thank you, Fred.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.003
Hey, come on.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.089
- Anything for Ed.
- Yeah.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.133
But I guess we're fucked
for choir practice now.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.051
- No! No.
- Fred: I know.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.845
- We'll figure it out.
- We'll figure it out.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.430
And, um...

23:52.430 --> 23:55.225
uh, your dad did tell me
that MJ had a stroke.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.310
- Yeah.
- Fred: Sorry.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.938
Yeah, well,
it's harder on my dad.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.982
Then he was just pushing
himself to do all this stuff

24:01.982 --> 24:04.109
that he can't really do anymore.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.695
- Well, you know,
he is a farmer.
- Yeah.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.530
Plus renting out the land
and then the barn,

24:08.530 --> 24:09.906
it was just all too much.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.325
So, I was like,
"Dad, now's the time.
Y-you have to go.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.286
- You've never done
anything for yourself."
- Joel: Mm.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.664
So, now he's on a boat with
his brother in Corpus Christi,

24:17.664 --> 24:19.332
- probably drinking
a beer right now.
- (laughs)

24:19.332 --> 24:21.668
- He is gonna have the best time.
We all know it.
- The best time.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.712
- You know he's raging
out there right now.
- (laughs)

24:23.712 --> 24:27.716
Oh, kids.
I-I know this is a lot,
but we got this.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.134
- We got this.
- We got this.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.343
Fred:
And...

24:31.553 --> 24:34.181
I also brought back...

24:34.181 --> 24:36.266
- cheese curds! Look at this.
- (cheering)

24:36.266 --> 24:37.601
(laughing)

24:37.601 --> 24:40.187
Put one in the freezer for Ed.
I know how he loves his cheese.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.438
- (Joel giggles)
- He loves cheese.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.607
- One for you, buddy.
- Oh goodness! Thank you.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.317
Sam:
Well, I guess
if we're partying,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.360
then maybe you're probably
wondering, like,

24:47.360 --> 24:49.529
- what we've been up to
this whole time.
- Alright. What do you got?

24:49.529 --> 24:50.864
Well, we like to drink
our teenie-tinis,

24:50.864 --> 24:52.616
and then we like to
open up the dance floor.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.035
- Joel: Oh, my God, this is
the song! This is the song!
- (turns on radio)

24:55.035 --> 24:57.829
- Turning it up!
Okay, Sammy and Joel!
- What are you doing?

24:57.829 --> 25:00.123
- You gotta get up on your feet.
- You want me to join?

25:00.123 --> 25:02.167
- Yeah, get the fuck up!
- Alright, shit!

25:02.167 --> 25:04.419

25:11.092 --> 25:12.677

25:12.677 --> 25:15.055
- All: Holler at me!
- Fred: Do I have
to do it like this?

25:15.055 --> 25:17.182
- All: Holler at me!
- (laughter)

25:17.182 --> 25:19.935
- All: Holler at me!
- Sam: Oh!
Shit, I can't breathe!

25:19.935 --> 25:22.938
- We did it! Okay.
- Joel: I need to stop.
I need to stop!

25:22.938 --> 25:26.149

25:43.625 --> 25:46.878
- (Joel's phone dings)
- (Joel and Sam laugh)

25:48.546 --> 25:50.507
- Joel!
- Joel: Yeah?

25:50.507 --> 25:52.759
How many active
hours do you have?

25:54.719 --> 25:56.304
Ten.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.056
Sam:
Oh, that's good.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.475
Is... is 13 better?

26:00.475 --> 26:02.602
(both laugh)

26:03.603 --> 26:05.272
I guess it's technic--

26:06.189 --> 26:09.317
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

26:09.317 --> 26:11.027
- What?
- Joel: No.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.738
They gave me two stars!

26:13.738 --> 26:16.992
They say I have
non-absorptive bath towels!

26:16.992 --> 26:18.785
Fuck them!
I picked out those towels!

26:18.785 --> 26:21.204
Your dog shit all over my house!

26:21.204 --> 26:23.248
Oh, these motherfuckers!

26:23.248 --> 26:25.458
Joel, we're gonna find 'em
and burn 'em alive.

26:25.458 --> 26:29.045
- I'm gonna write a letter!
- To who?

26:29.045 --> 26:31.381
I don't know. (laughs)

26:31.381 --> 26:33.008
(laughs)

26:33.008 --> 26:35.719
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.180
- Lights out.
- Alright.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.682
(light clicks)

26:40.682 --> 26:42.559
