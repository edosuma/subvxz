00:01.800 --> 00:08.000
(theme music playing)

01:08.640 --> 01:12.800
(indistinct chatter)

01:12.880 --> 01:15.800
(Angela) <i>All over school,</i>
<i>there are these certain places</i>

01:15.880 --> 01:19.720
<i>that are, like, reserved</i>
<i>for certain people.</i>

01:19.800 --> 01:25.640
My biggest regret is... breaking up
with Kyle like, before midterms.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.160
(Angela) <i>You're not supposed</i>
<i>to cross a certain line.</i>

01:29.760 --> 01:31.880
Sin! Hey, Abyssinia!

01:31.960 --> 01:36.240
(Angela) <i>It's this unwritten law,</i>
<i>like gravity or something.</i>

01:36.920 --> 01:38.760
Come on. They're waiting for us.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.440
(Angela)
<i>Like, in the basement near the north exit,</i>

01:41.520 --> 01:44.120
<i>there's this boiler room...</i>

01:45.440 --> 01:50.400
<i>where certain people will, like, go</i>
<i>for, like, only one reason.</i>

01:53.120 --> 01:57.400
<i>I'd never been there... ever...</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

01:57.480 --> 02:03.440
(upbeat music playing)

02:05.400 --> 02:07.120
I'm missing my geometry review.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.520
Luckily, it's optional.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.040
(bell rings)

02:15.120 --> 02:16.960
So, you had to take over
two English classes

02:17.040 --> 02:19.000
even though you're
a math teacher? Gee whiz.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.520
It was just temporary
till they could find someone.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.440
-Yeah.
-It was terrifying.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.520
I was never even good in English,

02:26.600 --> 02:30.440
but anyway I'm glad that they
finally hired you. I mean...

02:31.560 --> 02:35.160
Angela Chase, why weren't you
in geometry review?

02:35.240 --> 02:38.120
-Oh, I thought it...
-Angela, you need this.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.840
How are you going
to pass your midterm?

02:41.240 --> 02:46.320
I thought it was optional,
but I'll definitely... uh... no, yeah. No.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.320
It just breaks my heart,
some of these girls.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.040
I mean, they are just so smart, and yet...

02:55.120 --> 02:57.680
It's called low self-esteem.
Good morning.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.320
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm Marianne Chavatal.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.320
-Oh, hi.
-I'm sorry. This is Richard Katimski.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.600
Richard's taking over
my English classes they suck me with.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.440
By the way,
if you have any questions about...

03:09.520 --> 03:11.400
about anything, I mean...

03:11.480 --> 03:12.640
(bell rings)

03:12.720 --> 03:15.480
-Ah. Ah, well, to be continued. Okay.
-Oh, yes.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.640
By the way, if you need anything,
don't hesitate.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.200
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.000
-Renee, he's adorable.
-Shh! Shh!

03:25.080 --> 03:26.720
-Well, he is.
-I know.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.040
Since this is our first class together,

03:29.120 --> 03:33.840
I thought I'd start
with one of my favorite sonnets by...

03:33.920 --> 03:37.160
(mellow music playing)

03:38.920 --> 03:40.400
William Shakespeare.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.240
So who would like to read this aloud?

03:43.320 --> 03:48.360
(indistinct chatter)

03:50.160 --> 03:53.360
Gee whiz. It'll take me a while
to learn all of your names.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.480
-Where is Enrique Vasquez?
-Oh, Enrique!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.200
<i>SÃ­, mi nombre es Enrique.</i>

04:02.280 --> 04:03.840
And I want to live in America.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.560
(class laughs)

04:08.360 --> 04:10.040
I'm transferring out.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.640
Don't. We won't be
in the same English class.

04:12.720 --> 04:16.000
-You never even go to English.
-Well, in case I ever do.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.120
-Anyway, isn't Enrique legally your name?
-I don't care!

04:21.000 --> 04:24.280
And he acts like he's this nice guy
when obviously he's not.

04:24.360 --> 04:28.080
And he takes these unbelievably
long pauses like... okay, this is him.

04:29.600 --> 04:35.440
My name is Mr., uh... Katimski.
And here's a sonnet by William, uh...

04:38.160 --> 04:41.600
Shakespeare, who's almost
as boring as I, Mr., uh...

04:46.080 --> 04:47.080
Oh, no.

04:48.440 --> 04:52.080
-See you.
-Enrique. May I, uh...

04:53.760 --> 04:57.120
uh... speak to you for a moment?

04:57.960 --> 05:01.280
He actually asked me if I would
consider joining drama club.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.360
-He must have, like, no life.
-So? Neither do you.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.480
Drama club is something
I could almost picture doing

05:08.560 --> 05:10.480
if I was really bored or something.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.600
But with him running it? Pass-ola.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.280
-Where did you get Chinese food?
-Two words... Tino.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.840
So guess where Angela is.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.640
-I know where she is.
-You know? How do you know?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.600
Because I live in the world.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.000
It's so romantic.
They're, like, this couple now.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.360
We'll see.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.960
-(dogs barking indistinctly)
-(door opens)

05:37.040 --> 05:39.760
-Honey? I'm home.
-(door closes)

05:44.840 --> 05:46.000
(Patty sighs)

05:46.600 --> 05:49.000
-Please, don't get up.
-Hi.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.160
Hi.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.440
-Where's Angela?
-In reform school.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.520
Good.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.680
Maybe she'll learn how to make her bed.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.760
I'm just reviewing some terms
for the class tomorrow

06:01.840 --> 06:05.280
so I can follow what...
a lot of sauce stuff is in French.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.760
Graham, you'll be fine.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.200
It isn't even an advanced course.
It's intermediate.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.600
Yeah, but what's intermediate?

06:11.680 --> 06:14.800
What if I'm not intermediate
or not intermediate enough?

06:14.880 --> 06:17.280
What is "Medi... ocrity"?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.800
-Look it up.
-(door opens, closes)

06:24.880 --> 06:26.160
Hi.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.240
Well, hi.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.760
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.840
-So what have you been up to?
-Uh, studying for midterms.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.680
-You hungry?
-No.

06:40.760 --> 06:45.360
(upbeat music playing)

06:47.400 --> 06:51.440
Okay, now, I refuse to panic
just because she's happy.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.240
-Although it's alarming.
-Although it's terribly alarming.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.400
(Angela)
<i>Every night I make the same vow...</i>

06:59.000 --> 07:01.720
<i>that tomorrow I will go</i>
<i>to geometry review...</i>

07:02.720 --> 07:03.960
<i>but every day...</i>

07:06.560 --> 07:07.880
<i>we barely talked...</i>

07:08.520 --> 07:12.120
<i>so when we did, it came out</i>
<i>sounding really meaningful.</i>

07:13.560 --> 07:15.640
There's a tiny leaf in your hair.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.400
Where?

07:19.920 --> 07:21.960
Was that your stomach or my stomach?

07:22.040 --> 07:27.840
(mellow music playing)

07:27.920 --> 07:30.240
Your cuticles look like little moons.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.160
-My what?
-Your cuticles.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.680
Catalano, you down here?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.040
Shh.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.840
The fact that we come here...

07:45.280 --> 07:48.360
let's keep it, like, uh... our secret.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.360
Why?

07:52.120 --> 07:55.640
-No reason.
-Catalano, what are you doing?

07:57.560 --> 07:58.680
Nothing.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.720
-Who you got in there?
-Just... just a girl.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.240
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.720
Knock it off.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.120
-Who?
-Nobody?

08:10.600 --> 08:11.640
Shut up.

08:11.720 --> 08:17.440
(mellow music playing)

08:24.640 --> 08:31.280
Very good. Now draw a circle
with two intersecting chords.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.800
And when two chords
intersect inside a circle,

08:34.880 --> 08:39.040
the product of the segments
of one chord equals what?

08:39.120 --> 08:42.160
(Angela)
<i>My whole life became, like, divided...</i>

08:44.360 --> 08:45.560
<i>into kissing...</i>

08:49.960 --> 08:51.680
<i>and not kissing.</i>

08:56.680 --> 08:57.920
<i>Kissing...</i>

09:01.480 --> 09:04.960
<i>and... not kissing.</i>

09:05.040 --> 09:08.440
(mellow music playing)

09:08.520 --> 09:13.320
Once again, people, if you receive
less than a 70 on this quiz,

09:13.400 --> 09:17.280
you should be attending
my fifth-period review sessions.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.360
(Angela)
<i>In geometry, I felt like a criminal.</i>

09:20.280 --> 09:22.120
<i>I missed every review session...</i>

09:23.000 --> 09:24.640
<i>so I tried to be invisible.</i>

09:25.600 --> 09:27.280
<i>It's surprisingly possible.</i>

09:28.120 --> 09:30.360
<i>You just sit in the back and keep quiet</i>

09:30.440 --> 09:32.320
<i>and let the boys shout out the answers...</i>

09:32.840 --> 09:35.520
<i>which they will, even if they're wrong.</i>

09:36.400 --> 09:39.200
<i>Boys are less afraid of being wrong.</i>

09:40.040 --> 09:41.360
I'm not happy.

09:41.880 --> 09:46.400
(serene music playing)

09:46.480 --> 09:47.560
Good job.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.680
Miss Lerner, can I ask you a question?

09:51.760 --> 09:57.000
Anyone with a question about their grade
can speak to me tomorrow before class.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.640
(bell rings)

10:00.640 --> 10:02.880
-Hey, Sin, what's up?
-Nothing.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.920
I can't believe I have to go
to this reviews thing.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.120
With four more points,
I would've had a 70.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.520
-How about you? How'd you do?
-Uh, 60.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.200
-I guess I'll see you at review.
-Abyssinia, keep it up.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.960
She's always trying to make me feel better
or something.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.360
Well, maybe I can help you.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.800
-I did get six more points than you.
-That's true.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.480
Angela Chase, how do you expect
to pass your midterm?

10:32.560 --> 10:35.000
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry won't cut it.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.280
I want to see you at tomorrow's
review session.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.560
-Clear?
-Yes.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.360
You should really consider
having your lips frosted permanently.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.120
I feel like they were.

10:49.000 --> 10:49.960
I noticed.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.440
They look all, like, used,
but in a good way.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.000
-Hey, Ray, don't tell anyone, okay?
-That rhymed.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.920
Tell anyone what?

10:59.440 --> 11:02.080
That I'm meeting Jordan Catalano
in the boiler room.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.400
-Just... just don't tell anyone.
-Why?

11:06.000 --> 11:11.080
Because he doesn't want people to, like...
know about us yet or something.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.000
Angela, you're letting Jordan Catalano,
like, control you.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.280
What?
Who says he's controlling me?

11:18.120 --> 11:20.600
I can't believe this.
For months, you've been trying

11:20.680 --> 11:23.920
to convince me to do these
things I'd never dream of doing.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.840
Now that I'm actually doing them...

11:25.920 --> 11:29.760
haven't you made out with boys
in the boiler room hundreds of times?

11:29.840 --> 11:31.160
So?

11:33.320 --> 11:38.640
-So are they controlling you?
-No, because I am not you...

11:39.320 --> 11:43.400
because as I have stated a hundred times,
I don't get my emotions involved.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.800
I'm the type of person
who can handle the boiler room.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.760
You are not.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.880
Well, bye, Daddy.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.280
Oh. Tell mother thanks
for the curtain rings.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.640
Whoa. You hear that?

12:04.200 --> 12:05.720
You got a squeaky floorboard.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.640
-I'd look into that if I were you.
-Well, you're not me.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.240
-What's that you said?
-Nothing. I'll look into it.

12:12.120 --> 12:16.200
-It's right about there. You hear that?
-Yup. Uh-huh.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.360
Where's Mr. Fix-it tonight?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.600
-He's taking a class.
-A class?

12:20.680 --> 12:22.040
-Uh-huh.
-For what?

12:22.920 --> 12:25.400
Stocks, soups, and sauces.

12:26.280 --> 12:31.280
It happens to be a very advanced class
for very advanced cooks.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.040
Don't give me that advanced crap.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.840
He ought to be pulling his weight.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.680
Dad, stop it.
This is a big step for Graham.

12:37.760 --> 12:41.200
He's at a turning point in his life,
and I support him a hundred percent.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.760
Turning point. That's a hell of a note.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.720
You listen to me for a minute.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.560
Stop throwing money away
on some sauce class.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.960
Get one of those...
what do you call them?

12:51.440 --> 12:52.520
Marriage counselors?

12:52.600 --> 12:55.800
No, no. A headhunter.
That's what you need.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.440
Someone to get him a job,
so he can stop sponging off his wife.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.960
Dad. This is between me and Graham, okay?

13:02.040 --> 13:04.520
Please.
You don't know all the particulars.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.000
I'm your father.
That's the particulars.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.240
And you deserve better.

13:10.120 --> 13:16.600
-(upbeat music playing)
-(floor creaks)

13:16.680 --> 13:19.160
(woman sighs)

13:19.920 --> 13:21.000
Well...

13:22.160 --> 13:23.600
this utterly sucks.

13:25.840 --> 13:26.840
I hate waiting.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.600
My fiancÃ©Â says I have the shortest
attention span known to man.

13:30.680 --> 13:35.040
(indistinct chatter)

13:35.120 --> 13:37.200
-Gum? Breath mint?
-Uh...

13:39.880 --> 13:43.240
Well, we're off to a swell start,
aren't we?

13:43.320 --> 13:46.080
The teacher being 14 minutes late.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.920
Hey, doesn't this remind you
of a<i> Twilight Zone</i> episodes?

13:53.040 --> 13:55.560
They think they've signed on
for an ordinary cooking class,

13:55.640 --> 13:57.760
but were forced
to make awkward conversation

13:57.840 --> 14:00.560
with 13 strangers for all eternity.
(chuckles)

14:01.800 --> 14:04.840
No, wait. One of those human
behavior experiments

14:04.920 --> 14:08.160
to determine how long it takes
before we turn into <i>Lord Of The Flies.</i>

14:10.960 --> 14:13.840
I say we give him
five more minutes, then mutiny.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.400
Take over the stove. Are you with me?

14:19.240 --> 14:22.920
Maybe we should all go around the room
and say why we're here.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.400
I'll start.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.840
Hi, um, my fiancÃ© hates my cooking.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.200
Now you know everything. Next?

14:36.760 --> 14:40.320
-(dog barking indistinctly)
-(door opens, closes)

14:41.720 --> 14:42.720
Well?

14:43.600 --> 14:46.480
So, how was the class?

14:47.800 --> 14:48.920
Strange.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.320
Well, um...

14:56.240 --> 14:57.840
what do you mean, strange? I mean...

14:59.000 --> 15:00.160
How was it?

15:00.240 --> 15:01.920
Do we have any more
of that spicy mustard?

15:05.360 --> 15:10.200
Did you feel like everyone was more
experienced than you were or something?

15:10.720 --> 15:11.920
Why would you assume that?

15:12.600 --> 15:15.200
No, I wasn't assuming anything.
I was just asking.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.320
Graham... it's okay If you hated it.

15:20.160 --> 15:24.600
It would probably make more sense
just to take the tuition money

15:24.680 --> 15:27.880
and use it to hire a headhunter
or something.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.000
What? Where did that come from?

15:31.080 --> 15:35.000
-Well, if the class isn't working out...
-Who said it wasn't working out?

15:36.720 --> 15:38.120
Nobody.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.600
He never showed.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.360
We were all sitting there waiting,

15:46.440 --> 15:50.160
then finally this kind of loud woman
started complaining,

15:50.240 --> 15:51.840
which sort of broke the ice.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.560
She had a flip phone in her purse.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.520
She even had Steffan Dieter's
assistant's number.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.720
The kind of obnoxious person
that has everything.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.800
So it turns out Steffan Dieter
had been rushed to the emergency room

16:04.880 --> 16:06.320
with food poisoning.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.640
But not from his food.

16:07.720 --> 16:11.880
From these tainted shrimp
at some book signing.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.160
My God.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.160
And this woman, the obnoxious one...

16:16.240 --> 16:20.120
she got them to reschedule
the class for Friday.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.840
How strange.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.040
Catalano.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.240
In your own world much?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.520
-You going to Buffalo Tom Friday?
-Buffalo Tom.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.880
Yeah, Tito found out that they're playing
at Pike Street Friday night,

16:39.960 --> 16:41.040
like, unannounced.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.200
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Play, like, a set.

16:44.880 --> 16:45.880
Sure.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.080
-Okay.
-Yeah, so...

16:48.160 --> 16:50.120
So, Buffalo Tom, okay.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.760
-Well, later.
-Oh, okay.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.360
-You're welcome.
-Later.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.440
(door closes)

17:04.000 --> 17:06.360
I have all this geometry.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.960
I was hoping you'd be here.

17:12.040 --> 17:17.800
(mellow music playing)

17:19.040 --> 17:20.920
So, you're going to Buffalo Tom?

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
What?

17:24.280 --> 17:25.320
Buffalo tom.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.720
Didn't I hear that they're playing
at Pike Street?

17:30.200 --> 17:32.760
I think I heard that somewhere.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.000
Oh, yeah. I'm going.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.600
Why?

17:41.840 --> 17:42.960
No reason.

17:48.720 --> 17:54.120
(mellow music playing)

18:00.440 --> 18:03.160
(announcer) My So Called Life
<i>will continue here on ABC...</i>

18:17.040 --> 18:18.640
(bell rings)

18:18.720 --> 18:22.240
Rat it, spray it, tease it, freeze it,
spike it, shave it, or shove it?

18:27.120 --> 18:29.560
Excuse me, have you ever been to a class?

18:30.200 --> 18:32.880
Excuse me. I was addressing myself.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.720
Okay.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.600
So... what's the deal
with Angela and Jordan Catalano?

18:43.680 --> 18:45.680
Here's a thought... ask her.

18:45.760 --> 18:49.040
I can't.
She'll think I'm checking up on her.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.200
So, are they, like, a couple?

18:52.280 --> 18:55.400
From the point of view of what I believe,
or from what she believes?

18:55.480 --> 18:57.600
From the point of view of reality.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.160
What do you think?

19:01.080 --> 19:04.320
I'd have to say...
she could really get hurt here.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.720
Tell me something I don't know.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.320
I know. That's the whole problem.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.000
Don't you have French this period?

19:16.080 --> 19:19.760
You should talk.
You're never at our geometry review.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.160
Angelica...

19:21.240 --> 19:23.920
Angela, we're, like, concerned, okay?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.560
Because I cut a few geometry reviews?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.480
You two discuss me now?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.840
We don't discuss anything.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.680
-We're barely even...
-We're not even friends.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.520
-Are we friends?
-No.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.120
-I'm not discussing Jordan Catalano.
-Why not?

19:38.040 --> 19:39.920
Why is he keeping you two a secret?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.400
-How do you know he's keeping a secret?
-Rayanne told me.

19:43.560 --> 19:47.880
Look, the only reason we talk like this
is because we care about you.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.520
When I was drugging,
you wanted me to stop as my friend.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.200
You're comparing me making out
with Jordan Catalano

19:54.280 --> 19:56.920
to you getting your stomach pumped?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.560
You don't see the connection.

19:58.640 --> 20:01.920
-The connection is self-respect.
-Thank you.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.040
Angela, God, you know, the point is...

20:06.120 --> 20:09.360
Who is he to treat you like this?

20:09.440 --> 20:12.200
Yeah, you're not cool enough
for him to be seen with you?

20:12.280 --> 20:15.000
Exactly. And she's not slutty enough
for him to do it and brag about her.

20:15.080 --> 20:19.000
I mean, please, you deserve,
like, so much better.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.400
Just 'cause he's not Kyle,
and we don't go down the halls

20:21.480 --> 20:22.400
holding hands.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.400
What is holding hands?
I don't get it. What are hands?

20:25.480 --> 20:27.280
It's not even an erogenous zone.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.040
Erogenous. And it is to me.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.640
You're both wrong.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.120
And if he doesn't want
to be seen with me,

20:35.200 --> 20:38.120
then why did he ask me
to meet him Friday night at Pike Street

20:38.200 --> 20:39.680
to hear Buffalo Tom?

20:40.800 --> 20:43.600
Not that I can go.
I have too much geometry.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.560
Maybe I'll go. I like Buffalo Tom.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.360
What? I do.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.080
You know, I'm sick of being perfect.

20:54.160 --> 20:58.520
I broke up with Kyle. I have a total right
to screw up my midterms.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.400
More like an obligation.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.600
I have to talk to you.

21:07.240 --> 21:13.360
(serene music playing)

21:13.440 --> 21:14.480
Hi.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.680
Oh, hi.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.480
-It's Rene.
-Rene, of course.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.280
There's so many new names in one...

21:25.040 --> 21:26.160
week.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.920
-I just thought I'd say hi.
-Well, good.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.960
We never really got to finish
our conversation, so...

21:33.800 --> 21:37.960
not that we had to finish it.
I just thought...

21:38.920 --> 21:41.560
(chuckles) What a week, huh?

21:42.160 --> 21:44.480
I'll be so glad when midterms are over.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.480
So many of my kids
are just sliding downhill.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.640
It's so discouraging...

21:49.720 --> 21:53.200
but you try to reach out.
I mean, you really try,

21:53.280 --> 21:56.960
but when they don't take the next step,
it's just so frustrating.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.200
Would you excuse me?

22:01.480 --> 22:02.720
For a moment.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.240
Enrique.

22:06.960 --> 22:11.000
-Where are you two supposed to be?
-We were going to lunch.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.800
We had to stop by my locker...

22:12.880 --> 22:15.720
Spare me the explanation.
Just get to the cafeteria.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.000
Totally.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.000
Would you be interested
in joining drama club?

22:20.080 --> 22:22.960
-Would it get me out of anything?
-I doubt it.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.080
Okay. Go to lunch. See you, Enrique.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.480
Uh, people don't call me Enrique,
except, like, my grandmother,

22:31.560 --> 22:35.520
-and she's dead.
-Oh, okay I'll try to... boy...

22:36.160 --> 22:38.720
imagine having a name
like Enrique and not using it. Gee whiz.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.160
I'm an Enrique, too.
Sort of. Well... Richard.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.840
It's not quite the same thing.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.240
-No.
-Uh, Richard would be Ricardo.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.160
Oh, here's the sign-up sheet.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.080
By the way, in case you want to sign up.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.120
Did I talk to you?

22:58.720 --> 22:59.800
Yes.

22:59.880 --> 23:03.080
-I did? What did you say?
-That I'm not interested.

23:03.160 --> 23:07.200
-Oh, well. Maybe you'll change your mind.
-I'm positive I won't.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.080
If you do, here's the sign-up sheet.
It's right here.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.040
The first meeting's Friday after school.

23:11.120 --> 23:16.960
You don't have to answer right away.
You give it some thought. (chuckles)

23:21.480 --> 23:22.600
Do you see what I'm saying?

23:22.680 --> 23:25.360
(laughs) I was kidding you.
Can't you take a joke?

23:27.960 --> 23:31.960
-Rene? Uh, what is it?
-(Rene sighs)

23:33.080 --> 23:35.840
I just made the biggest fool
out of myself.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.000
(bell rings)

23:37.080 --> 23:38.800
No. You don't understand.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.160
He says, "Gee whiz."

23:41.720 --> 23:43.640
And he won't stop
with this drama club stuff.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.640
He's driving me stark, raving mad!

23:46.720 --> 23:48.400
Did I tell you what Angela Chase asked me?

23:48.480 --> 23:50.280
I cannot believe
they let people like that teach.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.160
She asked if I'd come over tonight
and explain congruent triangles to her.

23:54.240 --> 23:58.280
I said, "Do you know how long it's been
since I even had geometry?"

23:58.360 --> 24:00.560
She hands me her geometry book,

24:00.640 --> 24:02.400
like I'm supposed to review it
or something.

24:02.480 --> 24:06.000
He didn't even see the difference
between Enrique and Ricardo. (scoffs)

24:06.080 --> 24:07.800
Who's Enrique and Ricardo?

24:08.880 --> 24:11.760
Look at all this work I have to do.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.480
I could spend the entire weekend,
like, without meals.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.840
Even then I couldn't get it all done.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.400
They're two completely different names.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.760
I cannot believe what some people
will ask others to do.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.000
So you're not going?

24:26.320 --> 24:27.640
Well, I might stop by.

24:29.240 --> 24:30.960
Just to kind of take a study break.

24:31.760 --> 24:35.400
(indistinct chatter)

24:35.480 --> 24:36.800
Go on. Taste it.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.400
-It's terrible.
-Pardon?

24:38.880 --> 24:40.040
-No, go on.
-Oh.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.560
Don't take my word for it. Taste it.

24:41.640 --> 24:48.000
(indistinct chatter)

24:48.680 --> 24:52.320
-Just... it needs something.
-Yeah, like a taste.

24:53.440 --> 24:56.480
I can't believe you knew all that stuff
about pottage.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.160
Where did you learn that, France?

24:58.240 --> 25:00.600
-Just picked it up. Trial and error.
-Yeah.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.880
You're better than this class.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.560
Say... what do we think of him?

25:06.400 --> 25:08.880
-Steffan Dieter?
-No, Rush Limbaugh.

25:09.720 --> 25:10.680
Well, I think...

25:10.760 --> 25:14.280
Did you understand one word he was saying
through the entire class?

25:14.360 --> 25:16.240
Well, he's foreign.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.800
Also drunk.
Which one do you think he's been longer?

25:19.520 --> 25:22.280
-Shh! You really think so?
-Are you kidding me?

25:22.360 --> 25:25.680
Look at that schnoz.
It's a broken capillary festival.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.640
If he doesn't get it together,
I'll make such a stink.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.560
Really?

25:30.640 --> 25:35.960
Would I kid you? I mean, seriously,
we deserve better. I mean...

25:37.240 --> 25:38.440
don't we?

25:41.560 --> 25:44.080
Man, that Steffan Dieter guy is...

25:45.320 --> 25:46.600
What?

25:46.680 --> 25:49.640
-Really hard to follow.
-What do you mean exactly?

25:49.720 --> 25:51.320
These are nice. You actually made these?

25:51.400 --> 25:53.840
Yes, why do you sound so surprised?

25:53.920 --> 25:57.240
What do you mean,
"Hard to follow"? In what way?

25:57.320 --> 25:59.200
I mean it that in this sense
that when he speaks,

25:59.280 --> 26:00.920
it's hard to follow it.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.920
For you to follow or...

26:03.000 --> 26:04.440
-What did I just say?
-No, I mean...

26:05.040 --> 26:06.360
could nobody follow it or...

26:06.440 --> 26:07.880
Why would only I
have problems following?

26:07.960 --> 26:10.280
-I'm just ask...
-Why do you do this?

26:10.360 --> 26:11.360
Do what?

26:11.440 --> 26:13.680
I just asked is it possible
there were people,

26:13.760 --> 26:16.400
who followed what he was saying?

26:19.680 --> 26:21.000
I'm going upstairs.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.000
And for your information, he's a lush.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.040
He's a drunken lout.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.040
<i>âª Soft words spoken softly âª</i>

26:34.120 --> 26:37.120
<i>âª Spoken promises broken âª</i>

26:38.600 --> 26:41.840
âª <i>Close my eyes and stare... </i>âª

26:41.920 --> 26:45.480
See, I told you. You just got to put
your thumb over the picture.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.720
They're even cuter than on their CD.

26:48.800 --> 26:53.280
(loud music playing)

26:53.360 --> 26:56.400
<i>âª Volunteer... âª</i>

26:56.880 --> 27:00.120
I can't believe I'm here.
I have, like, so much work to do.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.240
He's not here.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.680
I mean, I have, like,
three midterms next week.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.560
She went to hear Buffalo Tom.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.400
(dog barking indistinctly)

27:14.800 --> 27:19.680
<i>âª I held her hand too tight... âª</i>

27:19.760 --> 27:21.520
We may as well just leave.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.360
I can't believe you want to leave already
just 'cause you don't...

27:26.880 --> 27:28.280
There he is.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.960
(music playing in background)

27:38.240 --> 27:41.160
There's Rayanne Graff and that weird girl
she always hangs out with.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.640
He doesn't seem like he saw me.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.400
-He's busy. I'm not even going...
-What? Forget busy.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.600
-He asked you to me him here, right?
-Why isn't he coming to you?

28:00.680 --> 28:04.400
'Cause he doesn't see me. He's busy.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.920
<i>âª Well, I put them in a jar âª</i>

28:08.000 --> 28:11.400
<i>âª I know that he has style âª</i>

28:11.480 --> 28:14.840
<i>âª I'd do it if I could... âª</i>

28:14.920 --> 28:16.840
Will you go over there, please?

28:17.440 --> 28:19.600
I mean, really. Really!

28:37.400 --> 28:38.600
Hi.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.360
Hi.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.520
Uh... you're kind of crowding me.

28:51.720 --> 28:55.360
(music continues playing in background)

28:55.440 --> 28:59.920
<i>âª I close my door at night âª</i>

29:00.000 --> 29:03.360
<i>âª But she gets in all right âª</i>

29:03.440 --> 29:06.920
<i>âª So I turn on the light âª</i>

29:09.160 --> 29:14.160
<i>âª I held her hand too tight âª</i>

29:14.240 --> 29:17.760
<i>âª Too hard to make it right âª</i>

29:17.840 --> 29:19.280
<i>âª So I couldn't sleep at night... âª</i>

29:19.360 --> 29:20.480
Angela!

29:23.120 --> 29:24.400
Angela, wait!

29:29.440 --> 29:30.880
Hey, Graff, want to play?

29:31.400 --> 29:32.640
Shut up.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.040
You know you like her.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.440
Would it kill you to admit it,
maybe treat her halfway decent?

29:49.800 --> 29:52.760
Because, you know, she deserves it

29:52.840 --> 29:55.280
and she's not going
to wait around for you forever.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.400
<i>âª I hope you know I would... âª</i>

30:01.360 --> 30:03.000
Man, they're, like, weird, you know?

30:04.280 --> 30:05.720
Both of them.

30:06.360 --> 30:10.040
<i>âª I hope you know I would âª</i>

30:10.120 --> 30:12.760
(music fades)

30:18.120 --> 30:19.760
(man on TV) <i>We tried to...</i>

30:19.840 --> 30:21.960
(Angela)
<i>There's something about Sunday night</i>

30:22.040 --> 30:24.560
<i>that really makes you</i>
<i>want to kill yourself...</i>

30:25.120 --> 30:27.880
<i>especially if you've just</i>
<i>been totally made a fool of</i>

30:27.960 --> 30:30.200
<i>by the only person you'll ever love</i>

30:30.280 --> 30:32.560
<i>and you have</i>
<i>a geometry midterm Monday...</i>

30:33.200 --> 30:36.120
<i>which you still haven't studied</i>
<i>for because you can't</i>

30:36.200 --> 30:38.280
<i>because Brian Krakow</i>
<i>has your textbook,</i>

30:38.360 --> 30:40.680
<i>and you're too embarrassed</i>
<i>to deal with it.</i>

30:40.760 --> 30:44.280
<i>Your little sister's completely</i>
<i>finished her homework,</i>

30:44.360 --> 30:48.160
<i>which is just so simple and</i>
<i>mindless a child could do it.</i>

30:48.240 --> 30:50.960
Mom, dad, I finished
my report on crustaceans.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.880
(Angela) <i>And that creepy </i>60 minutes <i>watch</i>

30:52.960 --> 30:55.680
<i>that sounds like your whole life</i>
<i>ticking away.</i>

30:55.760 --> 30:57.680
(Bernice)
Daddy's at his cooking class, honey!

30:59.400 --> 31:01.080
Ah... oh!

31:01.760 --> 31:02.760
Look.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.280
Angela, did you see
the wonderful report that Danielle did?

31:07.360 --> 31:08.440
Mm-hmm.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.040
(woman sighs)

31:16.920 --> 31:18.800
What can I say? What?

31:19.680 --> 31:20.760
Nothing.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.320
There is nothing to say!

31:30.800 --> 31:31.960
Listen, um...

31:33.240 --> 31:36.160
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.520
It's about Risotto.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.160
Don't you have your geometry
midterm tomorrow?

31:45.080 --> 31:47.760
-Yeah.
-Well, do you feel prepared?

31:48.720 --> 31:49.760
Uh-huh.

31:50.360 --> 31:54.120
I think I'm going to call Brian Krakow.
Maybe we can quiz each other or something.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.040
Angela, that's a really wonderful idea.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.600
Really. I'm so proud of you.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.760
I'm so grateful you didn't inherit
my math block.

32:03.840 --> 32:07.720
I was always so terrible in math,
and it affected my entire life.

32:07.800 --> 32:12.040
I was always afraid I'd pass it down
to your girls like a bad chromosome.

32:12.720 --> 32:13.840
Well, you didn't.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.120
Thank God.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.680
(knock on door)

32:22.800 --> 32:24.080
-I don't believe you.
-I know.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.600
You're in some dream world
that revolves around you.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.240
You have no concept
of anybody else's life.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.120
I know.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.800
You couldn't even imagine
the pressure I'm under.

32:31.880 --> 32:34.920
You think you're under pressure?
That's so laughable.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.800
Brain, you're completely right, okay?

32:36.880 --> 32:39.440
Could you explain geometry to me anyway?

32:39.520 --> 32:42.600
-Are you completely insane?
-Yes, I probably am.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.080
Do you think I care?

32:44.560 --> 32:47.880
You couldn't conceive
of how much studying I have tonight.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.840
Have you even heard of calculus?

32:49.920 --> 32:52.760
Geometry is a paid vacation
compared to calculus, okay?

32:52.840 --> 32:55.880
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be an accelerated?

32:55.960 --> 32:59.880
Do you realize the pressure
when it's assumed you always get As?

33:00.360 --> 33:02.080
"Hey, Brian, pull another A?"

33:02.160 --> 33:03.880
"That Brian, he always gets an A."

33:03.960 --> 33:07.920
You have the option of insanity. I do not!

33:08.000 --> 33:09.200
And that...

33:10.080 --> 33:11.600
makes me crazy!

33:13.120 --> 33:14.120
Hi.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.320
I have to leave.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.600
Um, I'm leaving.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.240
Goodbye.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.560
Your friend Krakow leave already?
Oh, you're home!

33:26.200 --> 33:27.520
I have to study.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.360
So?

33:30.560 --> 33:32.960
Steffan Dieter won't be teaching
for a while.

33:33.040 --> 33:37.160
He's in some rehab in Idaho
getting deglazed.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.400
Graham, I'm sorry.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.680
-I'm truly sorry.
-For what?

33:48.600 --> 33:52.440
Come on. Don't do this.
Don't stay in the class just to spite me.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.480
What?

33:53.560 --> 33:56.840
Please. This was my idea.
I forced you into it.

33:56.920 --> 34:00.800
Obviously it's turned out to be a total
and complete waste of time,

34:00.880 --> 34:04.400
so I was wrong, okay?
I learned my lesson.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.560
Okay, just quit the wretched class.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.160
I promise I'll never suggest
taking another class

34:10.240 --> 34:12.640
as long as either of us live.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.960
They want me to teach the class.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.440
What? (chuckles)

34:20.280 --> 34:23.320
-Are you kidding or...
-We were all just sitting there.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.560
It's becoming nightmarishly clear
he's not showing again.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.240
I'm thinking, "This has been
the stupidest week of my life."

34:31.120 --> 34:33.120
-And of course this woman...
-The loud, obnoxious one?

34:33.200 --> 34:37.160
She's going on and on about trying
to make risotto for her fiancÃ©

34:37.240 --> 34:38.280
and it was a disaster.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.160
So, I started telling her why.

34:40.240 --> 34:44.400
Pretty soon everyone's asking questions
and writing down what I'm saying.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.240
Suddenly this woman says,

34:46.320 --> 34:49.400
"You're so much easier
to follow than Steffan Dieter.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.120
You should teach this class."

34:51.880 --> 34:53.560
I waited for everyone to laugh...

34:54.680 --> 34:56.920
and, you know, no one laughed.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.520
(chuckles) Well, that's...

35:01.800 --> 35:03.280
that's wonderful!

35:05.920 --> 35:07.360
Why do you sound like that?

35:07.440 --> 35:10.560
Like what?
No. No. I... it's wonderful!

35:10.640 --> 35:13.920
I'm just surprised. Can I be surprised?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.200
-Aren't you surprised?
-Yeah. Very.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.880
Yeah. I'm going to do it, though.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.280
I just, uh...

35:25.480 --> 35:29.200
I wouldn't have minded if one of us
wasn't quite so surprised. (chuckles)

35:31.600 --> 35:33.720
(Angela) <i>The truly frightening thing</i>

35:33.800 --> 35:35.920
<i>is that even after everything</i>
<i>that happened,</i>

35:36.000 --> 35:40.080
<i>Jordan Catalano left a note in my locker</i>
<i>to meet him in the boiler room.</i>

35:42.400 --> 35:44.520
<i>The nauseating part is that I went.</i>

35:44.600 --> 35:49.280
(serene music playing)

36:11.600 --> 36:13.360
Don't say hello or anything.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.600
Hello.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.720
I can't believe I came here.
Why did you ask me to come here?

36:26.720 --> 36:29.520
-Why are you like this?
-Like what?

36:30.840 --> 36:32.520
Like how you are.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.400
So leave.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.640
Admit it first.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.320
Admit what?

37:01.520 --> 37:05.680
That all of this happened
that you have emotions.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.200
That you can't, like, treat me one way

37:12.280 --> 37:15.520
in front of your friends,
and the next minute leave me some note.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.600
And, by the way,
I spell my name with one "L."

37:32.960 --> 37:35.840
"My mistress' eyes
are nothing like the sun.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.480
Coral is far more red than her lips' red.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.920
If snow be white,
why, then her breasts are dun.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.360
If hair be wires...

37:47.320 --> 37:49.200
black wires grow on her head.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.080
I have seen roses damask'd,
red and white...

37:53.640 --> 37:56.520
but no such roses see I in her cheeks...

37:57.520 --> 37:59.960
and in some perfumes
is there more delight...

38:00.040 --> 38:02.600
than in the breath
that from my mistress reeks.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.040
I love to hear her speak...

38:07.040 --> 38:10.440
yet well I know that music hath
a far more pleasing sound.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.880
I grant I never saw a goddess go.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.880
My mistress, when she walks,
treads on the ground...

38:18.360 --> 38:19.640
and yet, by heaven...

38:20.360 --> 38:25.080
I think my love as rare as any she belied
with false compare."

38:28.600 --> 38:31.280
What kind of girl is Shakespeare
describing here?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.720
Is she the most beautiful girl?

38:38.120 --> 38:39.200
No.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.640
Is she a goddess? Hmm?

38:41.720 --> 38:43.280
Physically perfect?

38:43.840 --> 38:48.120
The kind of girl who stops traffic
when she walks down the street?

38:49.400 --> 38:53.360
-No.
-So he's not in love with her?

38:56.440 --> 38:57.960
Yeah.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.080
-He is.
-And why is that?

39:05.560 --> 39:07.280
Why is he in love with her?

39:08.720 --> 39:11.920
What is it? What is it?
What is it about her?

39:14.160 --> 39:15.680
That she's not just a fantasy.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.840
She's got, like, flaws.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.400
She's real.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.680
(serene music playing)

39:27.760 --> 39:29.240
Thank you.

You have Miss Lerner, right?

39:59.920 --> 40:01.000
For geometry.

40:01.920 --> 40:02.920
So?

40:04.200 --> 40:06.160
Nothing. I just didn't study at all.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.720
-Me neither.
-But I really need it.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.120
I might just skip the midterm.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.920
I mean, I'm going to flunk it anyway.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.080
Yeah, well, I just may skip it myself.

40:22.240 --> 40:26.560
I'm sick of being the little schoolgirl.
It's just not worth it.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.120
Why did I let this happen?
I've totally blown it.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.200
Why does he have, like,
this power over me?

40:35.280 --> 40:38.320
I haven't cut a midterm
in a real long time.

40:41.600 --> 40:46.520

-(indistinct chatter)

40:46.600 --> 40:50.120
If the two parallel lines are cut
by a transversal, then what?

40:50.200 --> 40:52.200
-The angles are congruent.
-That's it.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.080
That was the bell.
We'd better get out of here.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.680
We should take the test.
It would be dumb escaping.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.880
Did you hear? The copy machine
ate our geometry midterm.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.680
It's been postponed till tomorrow.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.280
-Aah!
-Aah!

41:07.040 --> 41:10.720
Okay. So Lerner's having another
review session this afternoon.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.760
Oh. Well, I'll definitely be there.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.680
Not me. I don't need it.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.080
(laughs)

41:18.160 --> 41:23.880

41:23.960 --> 41:26.520
Rayanne. Get over here.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.760
-Enrique.
-Later.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.280
Rayanne, wait.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.720
Gee-whiz. I was just thinking about you.

41:34.680 --> 41:35.920
Why are you doing this?

41:36.600 --> 41:38.800
-Pardon?
-This is not something I'm going to do.

41:39.360 --> 41:41.680
I'm not the type who joins things, okay?

41:41.760 --> 41:44.640
I'm really sorry, but that's not okay.

41:44.720 --> 41:47.120
-What?
-I'm a teacher.

41:47.720 --> 41:50.960
How do you expect me to react
to that ridiculous statement like that?

41:51.040 --> 41:52.840
Who are you, Groucho Marx?

41:52.920 --> 41:55.800
You'd never belong to any club
that would have you as a member?

41:55.880 --> 41:58.000
-What?
-What's holding you back here?

41:58.080 --> 41:59.560
I'm not cool enough?

41:59.640 --> 42:02.080
Don't let that your teacher's a dork

42:02.160 --> 42:05.280
stop you from fulfilling your potential.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.440
Just pretend that I'm a track coach.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.400
I happen to notice you can run fast.
I need you on my team.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.760
It's that simple, Enrique.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.880
Stop calling me that,
why are you calling me that?

42:15.960 --> 42:18.760
Sorry. I keep forgetting. It's just...

42:20.720 --> 42:22.520
Gee whiz, it's such a great name.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.440
When I was in high school,
I hated my name. I hated it.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.600
I don't hate my name.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.520
-I just...
-Good. I'm really glad.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.640
Nobody should...

42:42.320 --> 42:43.720
hate who they are.

42:43.800 --> 42:49.040
(indistinct chatter)

42:49.120 --> 42:55.480
(upbeat music playing)

43:56.920 --> 44:02.000
<i>âª I close my door at night âª</i>

44:02.080 --> 44:05.120
<i>âª But she gets in all right âª</i>

44:05.200 --> 44:08.800
<i>âª So I turn on the light âª</i>

44:11.040 --> 44:15.760
<i>âª I held her hand too tight âª</i>

44:15.840 --> 44:19.600
<i>âª Too hard to make it right âª</i>

44:19.680 --> 44:23.440
<i>âª So I could sleep at night âª</i>

44:29.600 --> 44:33.440
<i>âª If I could hold them in my hand âª</i>

44:33.520 --> 44:36.720
<i>âª I'd make them understand âª</i>

44:36.800 --> 44:40.320
<i>âª I'm not a haunted man âª</i>

44:40.400 --> 44:44.000
<i>âª I'm not a thoughtless guy... âª</i>

44:46.080 --> 44:47.320
Can we...

44:51.480 --> 44:52.720
like, go somewhere?

44:55.680 --> 44:56.760
Sure.

44:57.720 --> 45:01.680
<i>âª I hope you know I would âª</i>

45:04.560 --> 45:08.040
<i>âª I'd do it if I could âª</i>

45:08.120 --> 45:11.600
<i>âª I hope you know I would âª</i>

45:11.680 --> 45:12.880
Angela, wait.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.320
Don't forget... the geometry review.

45:17.360 --> 45:20.320
Forget it. She already did.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.840
<i>âª I'd do it if I could âª</i>

45:28.920 --> 45:33.560
<i>âª I hope you know I would âª</i>

45:51.840 --> 45:57.720
