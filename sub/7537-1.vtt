Heaven's blessed me. The boat is still here

01:00.280 --> 01:03.011
Everything will be fine
after I cross the harbour

01:03.046 --> 01:06.201
I really am playing with fire here

01:06.962 --> 01:09.756
Oh God... I'm gonna be so rich!

01:18.105 --> 01:18.936
Who...?

01:21.381 --> 01:22.934
There are so many of you

01:23.991 --> 01:26.615
My boss is Sam from the charcoal factory.
You'd better give him some face

01:26.882 --> 01:29.760
We are pirates
We don't care about onshore matters

01:30.002 --> 01:33.112
Oh you guys are my heroes,
I can't believe I've finally met you

01:33.522 --> 01:37.197
From now on I won't follow Sam
I'll join you and be a pirate too

01:37.482 --> 01:39.201
You can take this treasure

01:39.768 --> 01:42.273
I don't care for men from the mainland

01:43.082 --> 01:46.157
I'm not interested in this stuff.
You keep it

01:46.202 --> 01:48.158
It's not worth bothering about

01:50.271 --> 01:52.714
I just want your fingers

01:54.571 --> 01:56.037
Don't move!
I have a gun!

01:57.045 --> 01:59.274
A gun?
- Stay back!

02:05.282 --> 02:05.982
Give me your hand

02:07.913 --> 02:08.613
A gun you say?

02:08.882 --> 02:11.574
I have a gun too

04:21.202 --> 04:22.396
How are you Madam?

04:22.602 --> 04:25.478
Chiu, you are still out and about
during this storm?

04:27.382 --> 04:30.552
Stop messing about
and feed the little Master

04:30.602 --> 04:34.356
If you don't get fat
I'll let you be the coolie

04:35.922 --> 04:36.341
Boss

04:36.342 --> 04:39.079
If we can't ship this rice to Hong Kong
and leave it stored like this

04:39.282 --> 04:40.795
It'll get eaten by rats

04:42.882 --> 04:46.635
But what can we do?
The seas are full of pirates

04:47.162 --> 04:49.620
The foreigners employ troops to
protect their goods. It's like a war

04:49.802 --> 04:51.075
Can't I afford to employ guards?

04:51.082 --> 04:53.637
I'll do whatever it takes to ship this rice

04:58.048 --> 04:58.902
What's in that box?

04:58.937 --> 04:59.677
I don't know

05:00.678 --> 05:01.678
Little Master

05:05.151 --> 05:05.999
What's happening

05:06.763 --> 05:08.636
I told you to feed little master

05:08.962 --> 05:10.361
How dare you let him open that box?

05:10.682 --> 05:12.479
What's going on?

05:21.002 --> 05:23.277
The pirates again

05:23.722 --> 05:24.761
Save your breath.

05:24.822 --> 05:27.761
Stop squabbling
Go and take the children to bed

05:29.142 --> 05:30.139
Get out of here

05:31.449 --> 05:32.676
You jinx!

05:34.044 --> 05:37.160
"One finger for 100 catties of rice.
Send to the sea on time.

05:37.362 --> 05:41.196
or your fingers will be chopped off!
Signed Cheung"

05:44.662 --> 05:47.836
That pirate Cheung is an old man
He must be about 100 years old

05:49.393 --> 05:50.718
How can he threaten me?

05:51.036 --> 05:52.676
It doesn't matter if he's Cheung or not.

05:52.882 --> 05:55.032
All the pirates are dangerous

05:56.651 --> 05:59.680
I'm going to sit right here. If they
want the rice They can come and ask me!

06:02.042 --> 06:02.792
The box is filled with fingers

06:02.793 --> 06:03.793
So?

06:10.712 --> 06:11.412
Somebody's here

06:13.682 --> 06:15.812
Don't just sit there,
take the kids upstairs!

06:16.322 --> 06:18.561
Let's grab our weapons.
Put the bowls down

06:18.762 --> 06:19.592
There's going to be a fight.
Grab the weapons

06:20.122 --> 06:21.271
There's going to be a fight.

06:23.802 --> 06:25.120
Just wait,
don't open the door yet

06:25.282 --> 06:27.273
Right,
open it now

06:29.008 --> 06:30.507
We're armed.
Who are you looking for?

06:30.542 --> 06:32.995
I'm not looking for anybody
I was just passing by

06:33.922 --> 06:34.816
It's an armed troop

06:35.762 --> 06:39.471
Sorry, I've made a mistake

06:41.491 --> 06:44.835
He mumbled and had big eyes like an owl

06:45.042 --> 06:46.680
A guy like that must be an informer

06:47.927 --> 06:50.113
Follow that guy
to see where his base is

06:52.101 --> 06:53.179
We have to infiltrate their group

06:53.609 --> 06:56.264
100 catties of rice
for whoever gets information

06:56.299 --> 06:57.355
Why are you standing there?

06:57.390 --> 06:58.090
Let's go!

06:58.602 --> 07:02.515
Hey, let's hide our weapons first

07:02.562 --> 07:05.474
They're all scoundrels
All they care about is getting my rice

07:07.516 --> 07:08.760
This isn't the time to break down

07:08.962 --> 07:10.953
It doesn't work when it rains hard

07:12.145 --> 07:14.673
Leung Fu, did you find someone to help us?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.072
I've got more than enough helpers

07:18.342 --> 07:20.235
I can't believe they're so eager to help

07:20.562 --> 07:23.838
100 catties of rice!

07:32.233 --> 07:33.433
I am not "100 catties of rice"

07:35.720 --> 07:37.071
They don't seem to have come to fix the car...

07:37.282 --> 07:39.067
I asked you to get help
but you brought trouble

07:39.102 --> 07:40.652
you need the exercise,
there's two you missed

07:41.022 --> 07:41.722
I see them

07:58.332 --> 08:01.555
Master!
They...

08:01.556 --> 08:02.556
They've come for "100 catties of rice"

08:07.020 --> 08:07.879
I'll get you

08:08.280 --> 08:08.980
Go to hell

08:14.671 --> 08:15.678
18 drop kicks

08:16.579 --> 08:18.033
too many false attacks
not suitable for a gang fight

08:18.082 --> 08:19.959
I'm afraid I'll kick you

08:27.625 --> 08:28.493
You've made a mistake

08:31.436 --> 08:32.135
There is nobody here called
"100 catties of rice"

08:32.241 --> 08:35.273
100 catties of rice is 100 catties of rice
not somebody's name

08:36.748 --> 08:38.715
For 100 catties of rice
so many of you got hurt

08:38.922 --> 08:40.770
100 catties of rice is not enough
to pay for your medicine

08:41.919 --> 08:44.721
Aunt May, your shoe is wet

08:45.162 --> 08:47.392
But I still have to wear it
They are my only pair

08:49.648 --> 08:50.348
It was all a mistake?

08:50.984 --> 08:52.791
I think it's time to get out the first aid

08:53.922 --> 08:55.435
Ask Master to come out

08:55.642 --> 08:57.280
You fight and heal well

08:57.482 --> 08:58.676
Calm down

08:58.922 --> 09:01.516
I do apologise,
It's all been a misunderstanding

09:01.722 --> 09:03.280
You aren't pirates after all

09:03.482 --> 09:05.575
You mean you thought we were pirates!

09:05.576 --> 09:07.576
I Leung Fu am smart and handsome
Do I look like a pirate

09:07.682 --> 09:09.718
If you thought Club Foot was a pirate
It wouldn't be unreasonable

09:09.922 --> 09:12.038
I get sea-sick when I go sailing
How could I be a pirate?

09:12.242 --> 09:14.073
Have you ever seen a pirate
as handsome as me

09:14.122 --> 09:16.955
Sir, I'm sorry, we just wanted to find an inn

09:17.002 --> 09:19.038
But our carriage broke down
So...

09:19.362 --> 09:21.592
Since they are strangers
ask them to leave at once

09:22.402 --> 09:23.198
Please sir..

09:25.322 --> 09:29.031
Club Foot, Fu, Put down the pills and medicine
Let's go to the inn

09:31.475 --> 09:34.396
Take these pills
This medicine is for external treatment

09:34.602 --> 09:38.072
Po Chi Lam ointment is very famous
Did you know that?

09:39.058 --> 09:40.034
Po Chi Lam?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.419
Isn't Po Chi Lam the business
of Master Wong Fei Hung

09:44.420 --> 09:45.220
I think so

09:45.522 --> 09:47.121
Do you people know Master Wong Fei Hung?

09:47.642 --> 09:48.687
I am Wong Fei Hung

09:48.722 --> 09:51.873
We fought with Wong Fei Hung just now
It's our honour

09:52.202 --> 09:54.318
Your fist is fast as lightning

09:54.642 --> 09:55.580
Sorry for offending you

09:55.615 --> 09:57.175
I am Wong Kai Ying

09:57.629 --> 09:58.472
You have sparkling eyes!

09:58.978 --> 10:00.289
Please forgive me

10:00.711 --> 10:01.684
Leung Fu

10:01.970 --> 10:02.670
The owl

10:03.656 --> 10:04.961
He uses many fake stances

10:04.996 --> 10:06.397
I am Club Foot

10:06.744 --> 10:08.238
Your kick is really powerful

10:08.273 --> 10:08.973
Thank you

10:09.115 --> 10:10.982
How dare he dismiss my kung fu!
Fake Stances? Owl?

10:11.891 --> 10:13.226
I am Aunt May

10:13.261 --> 10:16.052
So pretty!
You must be Master Wong's wife.

10:16.053 --> 10:16.783
Pleased to meet you

10:16.784 --> 10:17.619
Attention please

10:18.117 --> 10:19.412
I am Leung Fu

10:22.272 --> 10:23.252
You clap for Aunt May

10:23.287 --> 10:25.617
So you should have clapped for me.
I'm not an owl

10:29.052 --> 10:31.115
I'm sorry I have a date
with my family at the inn

10:31.116 --> 10:32.116
Why not eat here this evening?

10:33.248 --> 10:34.459
See you later

10:34.936 --> 10:35.669
Come on, why not?
You're invited

10:35.704 --> 10:37.313
Let me find you a seat

10:39.563 --> 10:42.862
The dogs are really barking.
Go and take a look

10:42.897 --> 10:43.597
Master Wong

10:44.322 --> 10:47.338
I admire you so much.
You're a real hero

10:47.680 --> 10:49.695
I want to talk to you.
Don't go just yet

10:50.133 --> 10:51.903
Let us show you to the inn

10:52.926 --> 10:54.088
There's no need

10:54.547 --> 10:56.701
Do I pay you to show people around?

10:59.245 --> 11:00.098
Pirate!

11:01.225 --> 11:02.548
Master Wong
Let us handle this

11:04.763 --> 11:07.444
We've caught him. A guy dressed in black
trying to steal the rice

11:08.244 --> 11:09.547
They were afraid of pirates a moment ago

11:09.582 --> 11:10.446
But not now

11:10.481 --> 11:12.015
They are brave now Master is here

11:13.517 --> 11:14.453
You aren't going anywhere

11:17.481 --> 11:18.496
Get down, you daren't fight back

11:19.267 --> 11:19.967
Pirate dog!

11:20.715 --> 11:23.156
He can't breathe
He's convulsing

11:25.403 --> 11:27.782
Let go of me,
I'm not a pirate, I'm not

11:28.082 --> 11:29.025
Lend me your belt

11:30.101 --> 11:32.651
You brought this on yourself

11:32.851 --> 11:34.291
Be careful, his ribs are broken

11:36.351 --> 11:37.990
He is severely injured,
you'll have to carry him to the court

11:38.190 --> 11:39.437
To the court?

11:40.159 --> 11:41.113
Don't you have a court?

11:41.562 --> 11:45.225
The court is too corrupt

11:45.899 --> 11:46.655
Really?

11:47.099 --> 11:49.801
Well, we can't deal with this thief ourselves

11:49.836 --> 11:51.778
But we can't release him

11:51.813 --> 11:54.035
I'd like to check your court out for myself

11:54.070 --> 11:57.258
Club foot,
stay here in case his gang strikes again

11:57.293 --> 12:00.321
Let's drop our bags at the inn
then take him to the court

12:00.356 --> 12:03.575
Do you really mean to take him to the court?

12:03.610 --> 12:07.227
Don't worry, if the court can't deal with it
we'll try something else

12:12.967 --> 12:14.723
Master, we've arrived at Mu Min Lane

12:14.963 --> 12:17.009
The place is totally deserted, what should we do?

12:17.962 --> 12:21.591
Allied forces have occupied the capital

12:21.802 --> 12:24.760
But the south is unaffected

12:24.962 --> 12:27.476
The newspaper says the south is still
safe and prosperous

12:27.682 --> 12:29.115
Shouldn't that be prosperous and safe?

12:29.322 --> 12:31.438
Where did you get the paper?

12:32.042 --> 12:34.192
It's what our food was wrapped in

12:35.242 --> 12:38.655
Porky Lam
I'm asking you, what time is it?

12:39.156 --> 12:40.797
Er... Er...

12:40.832 --> 12:42.035
What time is it!

12:43.642 --> 12:45.041
Two holes

12:45.522 --> 12:47.087
Two holes?

12:47.088 --> 12:48.088
Wrong!

12:49.682 --> 12:51.479
Why are you so uptight?

12:51.522 --> 12:53.638
Master, we are looking for somebody

12:53.842 --> 12:56.072
I don't open the door at night,
come back in the morning

12:56.282 --> 12:57.560
What? So what do we do till then?

12:57.561 --> 12:58.561
Come on, we're not pirates, we're good people

12:59.362 --> 13:01.318
Well, we don't open the door at night,
come back tomorrow

13:01.522 --> 13:02.222
Sister May?

13:03.242 --> 13:03.958
Sister Yee?

13:04.682 --> 13:05.432
Fei Hung is here

13:05.482 --> 13:07.040
Not two holes!

13:08.202 --> 13:10.921
Lang, Sol, come and help with the luggage

13:11.242 --> 13:12.415
We're looking for a fat guy
and a guy with buck teeth

13:12.416 --> 13:13.416
Sister

13:13.802 --> 13:15.235
May

13:16.602 --> 13:17.641
Master

13:17.676 --> 13:18.681
Damn

13:21.602 --> 13:23.320
Fei Hung!

13:27.882 --> 13:28.855
Peony

13:37.722 --> 13:39.394
You've lost your shoe

13:39.602 --> 13:40.483
You are all I need

13:42.242 --> 13:43.098
What happened?

13:43.099 --> 13:44.099
Aunt Yee's overwhelmed

13:44.290 --> 13:46.331
She... What happened?

13:46.332 --> 13:47.032
She's lost control

13:48.882 --> 13:49.611
I don't care about my shoes

13:49.646 --> 13:51.658
So you shouldn't care about your luggage

13:53.242 --> 13:54.061
My God

13:54.160 --> 13:55.190
Father, are you ok?

13:55.191 --> 13:56.191
It's nothing

13:56.562 --> 13:57.995
Why didn't you shout out?

13:58.282 --> 14:00.000
I didn't want to disturb you

14:00.202 --> 14:02.033
I dropped the luggage on the floor
as soon as we arrived

14:03.642 --> 14:05.917
No need to explain,
I did the same when I was young

14:08.122 --> 14:10.920
Daughter in Law, you lost your shoe then

14:11.482 --> 14:13.438
You say you did something like this Dad?

14:13.439 --> 14:14.439
Who did you hurt?

14:15.042 --> 14:17.078
Don't ask, it's history

14:18.362 --> 14:21.638
Take the luggage to the room now,
we have to go to the court

14:21.842 --> 14:23.833
Fu, take the luggage up

14:24.042 --> 14:25.475
Aunt May, let me help you

14:25.682 --> 14:27.115
No thank you, I'll carry my own

14:27.116 --> 14:28.116
But... That's my luggage

14:28.722 --> 14:29.429
Have you got the shoe?

14:29.882 --> 14:30.590
Not yet

14:30.591 --> 14:31.246
Fu are you all right? What's wrong?

14:31.247 --> 14:32.247
Don't move

14:34.162 --> 14:35.540
Dad, be careful

14:35.541 --> 14:36.541
Ok, ok

14:38.322 --> 14:41.314
Fu there's something wrong with Aunt May,
what's going on

14:41.522 --> 14:42.714
I wish you hadn't of asked me

14:42.715 --> 14:44.015
Master has fallen for both of them

14:44.722 --> 14:45.438
Is he that kind of man?

14:45.473 --> 14:46.543
He's lost control

14:46.578 --> 14:48.419
He's split between the two

14:48.420 --> 14:49.420
It'll end badly

14:49.421 --> 14:51.243
He's out of his mind

14:51.522 --> 14:53.797
Acting out of desire

14:54.002 --> 14:56.641
Like an animal in heat

14:56.842 --> 14:59.276
What are you doing?
- Are you sick?

14:59.482 --> 15:01.750
Heart beating fast, feeling thirsty

15:01.785 --> 15:04.222
The show's just begun but the climax is near

15:04.223 --> 15:06.323
Let's see how Master handles this case

15:06.330 --> 15:08.994
Let's go and find something to eat

15:09.029 --> 15:09.849
Are you trying to shut me up?

15:09.884 --> 15:12.490
How to handle it?

15:12.491 --> 15:13.791
We know Master's secret

15:14.602 --> 15:16.815
If we blackmail him, he'll have to listen to us

15:16.842 --> 15:20.232
Even a hero can't resist a pretty lady

15:21.082 --> 15:22.276
Mmm, salted cake

15:22.842 --> 15:24.470
Let's see how you handle this!

15:26.322 --> 15:28.552
Master, I didn't say anything

15:29.802 --> 15:30.841
Leung Fu!

15:30.842 --> 15:31.842
Oh shit!

15:32.762 --> 15:34.673
This is a good show is it?

15:34.882 --> 15:37.191
Master... I

15:38.002 --> 15:39.053
Fu

15:39.054 --> 15:40.054
Why are you kneeling on the floor?

15:42.802 --> 15:44.952
What's wrong with you,
you look so pale

15:45.322 --> 15:47.233
I want to vomit

15:47.562 --> 15:48.041
Porky Lang

15:48.042 --> 15:48.451
Yes Master

15:48.452 --> 15:50.758
Go and ask Aunt Yee to join us for dinner

15:50.918 --> 15:52.737
Yes Master, right away

15:54.202 --> 15:54.902
Sol

15:59.562 --> 16:00.625
Go and eat something

16:01.091 --> 16:01.791
Yes Master

16:02.602 --> 16:05.912
Fu is not feeling well, let him go and rest

16:06.122 --> 16:06.931
Sit down

16:06.932 --> 16:08.122
He's well enough

16:09.842 --> 16:13.484
Fei Hung,
it's proving difficult to get tickets to Hong Kong

16:13.922 --> 16:15.715
We can't anything till the day after tomorrow

16:15.716 --> 16:17.016
I'm afraid there might not be enough

16:19.322 --> 16:20.755
What's wrong

16:23.122 --> 16:25.431
What's bothering you all

16:25.802 --> 16:28.508
Things are bad, but it'll get better soon

16:31.642 --> 16:33.099
Sister, why don't you shift up?

16:33.134 --> 16:34.556
You should sit closer to Fei Hung

16:36.242 --> 16:37.470
Dangerous

16:37.882 --> 16:38.582
Dangerous?

16:38.722 --> 16:41.236
I'm going to take the thief to court
with Club Foot

16:41.442 --> 16:42.256
Leung Fu, Lang

16:42.391 --> 16:42.961
Yes

16:42.962 --> 16:44.077
Sol, I didn't call you, sit down

16:44.402 --> 16:45.102
Follow me

16:45.103 --> 16:46.103
Yes Master

16:46.104 --> 16:46.804
Why not me?

16:47.042 --> 16:48.236
Fei Hung, wait

16:51.122 --> 16:52.914
The people in the barn said
the court couldn't be trusted

16:53.314 --> 16:54.788
Do be careful, ok

17:02.322 --> 17:04.040
Master this is the court

17:07.321 --> 17:09.199
Open up! We want to see the Magistrate

17:09.521 --> 17:10.222
Who's that

17:11.945 --> 17:12.401
Don't move

17:12.402 --> 17:14.962
What are you doing?

17:15.162 --> 17:17.722
I'm the Officer of the court

17:17.922 --> 17:21.311
Sir, we caught a thief stealing from the barn

17:21.521 --> 17:24.594
So we've brought him to you

17:34.522 --> 17:36.399
Good
Take him away

17:36.600 --> 17:37.300
Yes Sir

17:38.362 --> 17:41.240
Do you need us to sign anything?

17:41.442 --> 17:43.112
We've simplified the procedures now

17:43.147 --> 17:44.129
You may go now

17:44.882 --> 17:46.097
May I see the Magistrate?

17:46.455 --> 17:47.678
He's busy in a meeting

17:50.122 --> 17:50.671
They've gone..

17:50.672 --> 17:52.217
They didn't even ask our names

17:52.482 --> 17:54.550
We didn't have chance to get their names either

17:54.882 --> 17:55.582
Let's take a closer look

17:55.621 --> 17:56.321
Yes

17:57.642 --> 17:58.869
Bring some medicine.
We need to stop the bleeding. Hurry

17:58.870 --> 17:59.570
Ken?

18:01.242 --> 18:02.475
He's one of their men

18:03.002 --> 18:04.481
Ken. You'll be fine

18:04.962 --> 18:06.918
That's why they didn't trust the Court

18:07.642 --> 18:09.837
What do you know? Pea brain

18:10.042 --> 18:11.763
Well they know the guy's name

18:11.840 --> 18:13.042
I know

18:13.442 --> 18:14.380
Fu, get Lang to kick the door in

18:14.411 --> 18:15.274
Yes

18:27.162 --> 18:27.862
What?

18:30.122 --> 18:30.822
It's just a cat

18:34.002 --> 18:36.311
Not a good cat impression

18:50.602 --> 18:52.081
A cat and a dog?

19:01.962 --> 19:02.662
You're not in a zoo

19:04.562 --> 19:05.950
Kick the door in. Kick it!

19:05.951 --> 19:06.944
What?

19:07.722 --> 19:08.686
Kick the door open!!

19:08.687 --> 19:09.687
Break it down?

19:09.688 --> 19:11.388
No, kick it, kick it

19:27.962 --> 19:28.859
Come back here

19:37.042 --> 19:38.236
Cross Fist

19:40.802 --> 19:41.518
Lightning Kick

19:58.303 --> 19:59.033
Fu!

20:06.562 --> 20:08.234
Porky Lang, catch!

20:08.482 --> 20:09.198
Got you

20:09.842 --> 20:10.421
Don't move

20:10.422 --> 20:12.362
Who are you?
How dare you come in here?

20:12.363 --> 20:13.363
Who are you?

20:17.082 --> 20:20.378
How dare you pretend to be an Officer

20:20.882 --> 20:21.845
We didn't

20:23.162 --> 20:24.828
We are the constables

20:25.242 --> 20:26.310
So how come you're in league with a thief?

20:26.345 --> 20:27.503
Don't try to lie to us

20:28.204 --> 20:28.901
What?

20:28.902 --> 20:29.602
Put him down!

20:30.574 --> 20:31.707
Nobody move!
Or I break him in two!

20:32.322 --> 20:35.712
I'm Ken. I'm a constable too

20:40.802 --> 20:43.855
Please heroes, we are not lying to you

20:45.042 --> 20:47.510
We deserve to be punished for stealing

20:47.562 --> 20:49.553
But we had no other choice

20:50.049 --> 20:53.023
Because we haven't eaten for days

20:53.058 --> 20:54.236
It's so hard

20:57.202 --> 20:59.351
You are the Officer of the Court

20:59.386 --> 21:00.870
How come you don't have any food?

21:03.242 --> 21:05.156
Since the Allied forces captured the capital

21:05.562 --> 21:07.048
And the Empress Dowager went into hiding

21:08.362 --> 21:10.221
The Magistrate took everything and left

21:13.522 --> 21:15.240
Leaving us without a penny

21:15.282 --> 21:18.479
And so far nobody has replaced him

21:18.522 --> 21:21.990
As we have no food, many have left already

21:22.570 --> 21:24.546
We are all that remain

21:24.837 --> 21:26.603
At the same time, the pirates loot freely

21:26.604 --> 21:28.706
The citizens dare not leave their houses

21:29.562 --> 21:31.792
The place is a like a ghost town

21:32.002 --> 21:34.036
Please forgive our intrusion

21:34.115 --> 21:34.915
May I ask your name?

21:35.122 --> 21:36.191
I am called Tse

21:36.522 --> 21:38.999
I am Wong Fei Hung, these are my students

21:39.442 --> 21:40.286
Wong Fei Hung?

21:40.287 --> 21:42.146
Wong Fei Hung from Fu Shan?

21:42.202 --> 21:43.237
At your service

21:43.802 --> 21:46.111
I am Porky Lang

21:46.322 --> 21:47.801
Hello

21:48.002 --> 21:49.640
I am Club Foot

21:53.202 --> 21:54.555
You have great students

21:54.802 --> 21:57.420
I can't believe we have so many heroes here

21:57.762 --> 21:59.161
May I know your name?

22:00.909 --> 22:01.751
I am Leung Fu

22:02.082 --> 22:04.312
Wow it's Leung Fu

22:06.135 --> 22:06.835
Leung Fu?

22:07.482 --> 22:09.632
You are Master Wong Fei Hung's student?

22:09.842 --> 22:11.639
We are from Mei Province too

22:11.842 --> 22:13.418
You are the hero of the province

22:13.419 --> 22:14.419
We are so happy to meet you

22:15.322 --> 22:17.074
You are so handsome

22:17.122 --> 22:20.353
You have an heroic air, so impressive

22:20.402 --> 22:23.394
Wait until we tell our villagers we've met you,
they'll be so jealous

22:23.482 --> 22:29.352
At last...
These guys don't call me Owl!

22:29.402 --> 22:31.151
I've never seen Fu look so touched

22:31.152 --> 22:32.452
It makes me want to cry

22:35.602 --> 22:36.557
Really?

22:36.762 --> 22:41.119
The Dragon Boat has arrived

22:42.962 --> 22:47.160
Moving up to the top, the very top

22:48.962 --> 22:54.958
Fortune comes, comes to my door

22:55.002 --> 22:57.960
It's midday and all the doors are closed

22:58.162 --> 23:01.154
Do you think this place can ever be saved?

23:01.362 --> 23:03.432
They are scared, what a terrible way to live

23:06.522 --> 23:08.717
Look at the constables, like beggars

23:09.922 --> 23:11.592
Eat slowly, there is still rice left

23:11.627 --> 23:12.327
Thank you

23:12.807 --> 23:14.073
Such a long needle

23:14.074 --> 23:15.574
It will fight the infection

23:24.122 --> 23:26.682
Dad, we're leaving tomorrow, here are the tickets

23:26.882 --> 23:28.694
I feel better now we have them

23:28.794 --> 23:29.611
Get a good sleep

23:29.612 --> 23:31.951
More sleep?
We can sleep when we get to Hong Kong

23:33.842 --> 23:35.471
Sis, Hong Kong means "Fragrant Harbour"

23:35.572 --> 23:36.772
Is it filled with sweet smelling flowers?

23:37.682 --> 23:39.400
Flowers? I don't think so

23:39.602 --> 23:42.958
But being called Hong Kong
it shouldn't smell too bad

23:44.002 --> 23:47.056
Sister,
you stayed with Fei Hung for some time in Beijing

23:47.057 --> 23:48.057
What do you think about him?

23:50.482 --> 23:53.792
We seldom saw each other
and we didn't talk much

23:54.002 --> 23:57.199
We were both too busy for socialising

23:57.962 --> 24:00.317
But you came in the same carriage

24:01.162 --> 24:04.074
But we sat separately

24:05.202 --> 24:08.274
So you never got to know him?

24:08.762 --> 24:11.401
We are different ages

24:11.762 --> 24:12.911
I'm his Aunt, he's my junior

24:13.242 --> 24:16.518
Seniors don't notice the merits of the juniors

24:16.722 --> 24:17.921
But you think he's a good man?

24:18.222 --> 24:20.433
I think everybody is good at heart

24:22.442 --> 24:24.512
It's what you think that counts

24:25.042 --> 24:26.138
But I wanted your opinion

24:26.139 --> 24:27.342
You got it

24:28.802 --> 24:32.351
Oh, forget it.
Just answer me this

24:32.562 --> 24:34.075
Go ahead.
What?

24:35.322 --> 24:36.311
Do you have feelings for Fei Hung?

24:44.322 --> 24:45.880
What have you done,
what were you thinking?

24:46.082 --> 24:48.915
I was just thinking about your question

24:49.242 --> 24:51.631
You should be more careful

24:52.682 --> 24:56.641
I was being careful
but I couldn't avoid it

24:58.082 --> 25:01.233
It's ok, I understand

25:39.562 --> 25:41.837
This is old Master's, and this...

25:42.042 --> 25:43.919
Let's draw for it, that'd be fairest

25:44.122 --> 25:46.397
Whoever picks the blue one, takes three

25:46.682 --> 25:48.798
Whoever picks the black one takes the rest

25:49.002 --> 25:50.720
Dad, do you think he wants to be alone or not?

25:51.042 --> 25:53.078
What do you think

25:54.597 --> 25:56.355
It's the just the way he is

25:56.402 --> 25:59.394
We'll have to escort him on board tomorrow

25:59.602 --> 26:00.398
Nothing for me!

26:01.142 --> 26:01.842
I've got the red one

26:02.662 --> 26:03.695
I got blue, I'll carry three

26:04.636 --> 26:06.283
I got the black one

26:07.002 --> 26:07.702
Tickets to Hong Kong

26:07.797 --> 26:09.805
There are only two left
Four thousand each

26:10.286 --> 26:10.986
I want one

26:11.282 --> 26:12.584
Four thousand, don't you have anything cheaper?

26:13.234 --> 26:14.798
How about an underwater seat, they're free!

26:17.442 --> 26:19.398
Make way

26:20.162 --> 26:21.298
Where do we get on?

26:21.757 --> 26:22.813
These tickets are so expensive

26:24.421 --> 26:26.365
That tout is a real thief

26:26.400 --> 26:28.535
If we sold ours at that price we'd be rich

26:28.536 --> 26:29.985
And how do we get to Hong Kong
if we sell our tickets?

26:30.020 --> 26:30.696
I was joking

26:30.697 --> 26:31.797
It's not a joking matter

26:32.595 --> 26:36.121
Make way

26:36.167 --> 26:38.034
Sol, why aren't you carrying anything?
Where's the luggage?

26:38.082 --> 26:39.347
Didn't you pick the black straw?

26:39.402 --> 26:40.750
It's... all sorted

26:41.403 --> 26:43.888
You should be carrying it, give it back to him

26:43.889 --> 26:45.955
Be careful, don't push

26:45.956 --> 26:46.956
Fei Hung is over there. Go on

26:47.562 --> 26:49.261
How long will we have to wait?

26:49.262 --> 26:50.262
Just sit down

26:50.802 --> 26:53.474
There's no rush, we've waited for days already

26:53.582 --> 26:55.640
Somebody will sell their tickets to us

26:55.842 --> 26:56.779
Sol, is it heavy?

26:57.415 --> 26:58.596
It really is

27:02.882 --> 27:05.032
I'm going to the toilet, back in a minute

27:20.642 --> 27:21.631
Are you going to Hong Kong?

27:25.322 --> 27:27.233
It's only one ticket,
ask one of your family to go onboard now

27:27.282 --> 27:28.150
They've all gone on already

27:28.378 --> 27:30.009
Some bearded guys gave them their tickets

27:30.010 --> 27:32.981
They said Wong Fei Hung would give me his ticket

27:33.202 --> 27:34.201
Are you Wong Fei Hung?

27:34.706 --> 27:35.536
Yes

27:35.537 --> 27:36.537
Thank you Master Hung

27:37.242 --> 27:38.757
Some bearded guys?

27:45.162 --> 27:47.213
Thank you Master Hung

27:47.248 --> 27:49.264
See you beardy guys

27:55.722 --> 27:57.434
Peony, Aunt May?

27:57.884 --> 27:59.080
Your disguised too?

28:01.681 --> 28:02.699
Doesn't it itch?

28:04.042 --> 28:05.270
Yes it does

28:07.882 --> 28:11.079
There are eight gangs of pirates
on the East Canton sea

28:11.282 --> 28:13.238
Cheung leads the Red Flag Gang,
the cruellest of them all

28:13.442 --> 28:14.868
Mak Yau Kam leads the Blue Flag Gang

28:15.285 --> 28:16.470
Ha Mo Yang leads the Black Flag Gang

28:16.953 --> 28:17.950
Tiger leads the Green Flag Gang

28:18.240 --> 28:19.657
They are known as
"The four kings of the sea"

28:19.776 --> 28:21.631
Their power is growing rapidly

28:21.632 --> 28:24.232
In the 15th year of Ka Hing,
in order to maintain peace

28:24.322 --> 28:26.346
The government was forced to negotiate with them

28:26.347 --> 28:27.623
Cheung therefore became an official officer

28:28.402 --> 28:31.553
Now things are unsettled
and the pirates have become active again

28:31.670 --> 28:33.652
In South Pun Soon they are causing real problems

28:34.042 --> 28:36.935
The year Cheung became an officer
he was about 80 years old

28:37.682 --> 28:39.554
He can't still be alive

28:39.762 --> 28:42.356
According to my information,
these pirates are from the eight flags

28:43.202 --> 28:46.194
Their leader is Cheung's son, Cheung Yuk Lun

28:46.402 --> 28:49.155
And his right hand man, Ying

28:51.322 --> 28:53.438
How many followers does he have

28:54.842 --> 28:56.578
They move silently and leave no survivors

28:56.613 --> 28:58.741
So I really can't put a figure on it

28:59.024 --> 28:59.917
Master

28:59.952 --> 29:03.713
We can organise a local crime prevention unit

29:03.922 --> 29:04.957
Good idea

29:05.602 --> 29:08.639
We don't know where they are,
we'd better be careful

29:08.842 --> 29:12.676
But we can't let them know
the magistrate has gone

29:12.882 --> 29:13.357
Sir

29:13.358 --> 29:14.058
Master Wong

29:14.322 --> 29:16.235
I hope you'll let us move into the courthouse

29:16.236 --> 29:17.236
Of course

29:18.482 --> 29:21.235
First of all, the court must be open as usual

29:21.442 --> 29:23.512
You should all put uniforms on

29:23.722 --> 29:26.236
Dad, please disguise yourself as the magistrate

29:26.562 --> 29:28.553
Disguise myself?

29:29.082 --> 29:31.055
Sorry we don't have enough rooms

29:31.139 --> 29:33.171
Please would you stay in the cells

29:33.318 --> 29:34.360
Not a problem
Thank you

29:34.734 --> 29:35.412
Which is mine?

29:35.413 --> 29:37.551
This one, we've given you the biggest one

29:37.552 --> 29:39.397
Not bad at all

29:39.642 --> 29:41.473
What's inside this box?
It seems heavy

29:41.682 --> 29:44.196
I've no idea, it's been sitting here forever

29:44.402 --> 29:45.955
Nobody understands the English written on it

29:45.956 --> 29:48.261
We daren't move it as we don't know what's inside

29:50.602 --> 29:52.001
What's inside?

29:52.682 --> 29:54.673
Armaments

30:00.252 --> 30:02.745
Oh, nothing special, just foreign stuff

30:02.746 --> 30:04.541
We Chinese don't use these things

30:04.882 --> 30:08.113
Let's get rid of it
Come on, take it away

30:08.322 --> 30:10.290
Just a minute, better tell Master first

30:10.402 --> 30:11.920
Yes we must inform Master first

30:11.921 --> 30:12.921
Isn't that right Sir?

30:28.842 --> 30:29.714
What have you got there?

30:29.715 --> 30:30.695
Come here

30:33.202 --> 30:34.794
Wait a moment

30:39.922 --> 30:42.994
Fei Hung, we're always on the move

30:43.202 --> 30:45.352
It's difficult for us to tie the knot

30:47.642 --> 30:49.917
I want you to do one thing for me

30:52.802 --> 30:54.041
Put this ring on my finger

30:54.501 --> 30:56.105
You want me to put it on for you

30:57.780 --> 30:59.233
Come on, it's a custom

31:06.296 --> 31:07.320
What kind of custom is this?

31:07.539 --> 31:08.804
Put it on, then I'll tell you

31:11.672 --> 31:13.134
I'll put one on you next

31:13.135 --> 31:14.535
I have to wear one too?

31:14.539 --> 31:17.380
Of course, the rings are a pair

31:17.415 --> 31:19.307
They are a symbol of our marriage

31:19.362 --> 31:20.431
Marriage?

31:20.432 --> 31:21.179
I must tell Dad first

31:21.214 --> 31:23.071
Let's tell him after the wedding

31:23.242 --> 31:25.360
You can't leave in the middle of the ceremony

31:27.692 --> 31:28.541
Confetti

31:30.882 --> 31:33.680
Why do you suddenly want to get married?

31:33.862 --> 31:35.921
Well have to wait for ever otherwise

31:35.922 --> 31:36.922
And you..

31:37.322 --> 31:39.084
Right well, let's hurry it up

31:41.362 --> 31:42.983
Hubby, you can lift my veil now

31:43.302 --> 31:44.014
Hubby?

31:44.517 --> 31:45.968
Better just call me Fei Hung

31:46.722 --> 31:48.440
Fei Hung, kiss me

31:50.162 --> 31:51.481
Kiss you?

31:51.922 --> 31:53.150
Do I really have to?

31:53.362 --> 31:54.875
Hurry up, nobody will see you, then it's done

31:55.882 --> 31:57.016
Really?

31:59.741 --> 32:00.441
Here goes

32:03.442 --> 32:04.298
Master

32:04.299 --> 32:04.999
What's this?

32:05.755 --> 32:06.460
Beauty's temptation

32:08.682 --> 32:09.876
What...

32:09.922 --> 32:11.097
They run so fast

32:21.373 --> 32:24.317
Wow, this ring has incredible power

32:26.562 --> 32:28.871
This is the Magistrate

32:34.762 --> 32:37.401
You officers want to organise
a Local Crime Prevention Unit

32:37.602 --> 32:39.194
I would like to join

32:39.402 --> 32:41.757
But I can't speak on behalf of my students

32:41.962 --> 32:43.224
You'd better ask them personally

32:48.002 --> 32:49.993
See you

32:52.322 --> 32:54.199
So, are we going to fight the pirates
or the foreigners?

32:54.402 --> 32:57.712
If we let the pirates land
they'll fight the foreigners for us

32:57.922 --> 33:01.153
Why don't we ally with the pirates?

33:03.202 --> 33:07.718
You're so ignorant, in fact,
the senior officials have already decided

33:07.922 --> 33:09.833
It's all been worked out

33:10.042 --> 33:12.317
The pirates are just puppets

33:12.522 --> 33:16.401
We can't begin to understand
the hidden agendas

33:16.602 --> 33:19.275
If we get involved it will end badly for us

33:23.962 --> 33:27.141
We just do what the boss tells us,
you must ask him first

33:27.602 --> 33:30.363
How can we judge who is good and who is evil?

33:30.364 --> 33:31.664
Besides, the winner is always right

33:32.362 --> 33:33.062
That's right

33:33.562 --> 33:36.156
There is an old Chinese saying
"In troubled times, heroes appear"

33:36.362 --> 33:39.399
Let history decide who the heroes were

33:39.602 --> 33:41.957
We cannot change the course of history

33:44.562 --> 33:45.974
How can we ever mobilize them?

33:46.862 --> 33:49.114
They lack the spirit of unity

33:49.762 --> 33:50.638
Ok, take a break now

33:58.322 --> 34:00.677
Being a Magistrate seems like tiring work

34:00.882 --> 34:02.474
There's still no decision

34:03.042 --> 34:05.237
The chain is broken

34:05.442 --> 34:06.761
Let me help you

34:07.122 --> 34:08.918
What's the matter Dad?

34:09.121 --> 34:11.581
This chain is the only thing
that makes me look like an officer

34:11.601 --> 34:13.201
Now it's broken what am I going to do?

34:13.402 --> 34:14.715
Never mind, we can stitch it together

34:15.630 --> 34:16.574
What a pain

34:16.681 --> 34:18.592
Some went behind the door

34:22.242 --> 34:24.375
The show's starting
starring Master and Aunt May

34:24.409 --> 34:25.284
What's the title?

34:25.286 --> 34:28.177
Maybe he's just teaching her kung fu

34:30.322 --> 34:34.110
One's up, one's down,
what kind of kung fu is this?

34:35.802 --> 34:37.952
Dad.. There's more here

34:38.681 --> 34:39.534
What is this kung fu?

34:39.536 --> 34:40.359
Don't you know?

34:40.641 --> 34:42.712
Sol, kneel down

34:43.121 --> 34:45.317
Let me demonstrate, watch closely

34:48.522 --> 34:51.195
Wait
Get up again

34:54.322 --> 34:55.463
So you can do what you like

34:55.464 --> 34:56.464
It's so late, what are you doing here

34:58.762 --> 35:01.071
You scared me, why don't you go to bed?

35:01.282 --> 35:03.285
We're hungry,
we're just grabbing something to eat

35:03.385 --> 35:04.593
Clubfoot, grab a watermelon

35:04.722 --> 35:05.850
I'll make a watermelon dessert

35:06.304 --> 35:07.829
It's my speciality, it's not easy

35:07.830 --> 35:08.830
What are you doing Aunt Yee?

35:08.831 --> 35:10.943
Tomorrow is Fei Hung's birthday,
I'm making him a cake

35:11.063 --> 35:13.070
Let me help you..
Wah, it's so hot

35:13.122 --> 35:14.060
Check out the cake!!

35:14.061 --> 35:16.465
Fantastic!
Can you teach me how to make one?

35:18.882 --> 35:19.833
Put it here

35:19.868 --> 35:21.765
I've never seen a cake so big

35:21.800 --> 35:22.761
It's just a cake, sit down!

35:22.796 --> 35:23.496
Let me teach you

35:23.522 --> 35:26.355
Sol, bring me some small candles

35:26.562 --> 35:28.996
Then put the cream inside a bag

35:30.922 --> 35:32.742
What did she say?

35:32.842 --> 35:34.449
We can't keep this up for much longer

35:37.282 --> 35:38.500
Oh no, the cake!

35:38.943 --> 35:39.643
Put it back on the table

35:39.662 --> 35:40.643
It's a mess now

35:41.480 --> 35:42.180
Pick up that piece

35:42.602 --> 35:45.036
Reform the shape

35:45.362 --> 35:47.637
Not that shape, it didn't have corners

35:47.962 --> 35:50.351
It should be round

35:50.682 --> 35:52.081
Not like that

35:53.162 --> 35:54.356
Put that piece here

35:54.682 --> 35:56.001
Dad, line it up first

35:56.562 --> 35:58.200
She's coming
Oh shit!

35:58.522 --> 36:00.240
Stop squeezing

36:00.682 --> 36:01.618
It's too late, we're in for it!

36:01.619 --> 36:02.619
Cover it with something

36:03.722 --> 36:04.834
Aunt Yee, can we do anything else for you?

36:04.835 --> 36:05.733
We love making cakes

36:08.082 --> 36:09.993
A little more at the front

36:10.242 --> 36:13.279
Aunt Yee what's next?

36:13.482 --> 36:14.359
Use your finger?

36:14.360 --> 36:17.929
You put it on but you didn't mean it

36:19.522 --> 36:21.558
You have to put in on your finger too?

36:21.762 --> 36:22.591
Are they really together?

36:22.592 --> 36:23.592
Spread it evenly

36:26.202 --> 36:28.762
My eyesight is failing me

36:31.322 --> 36:32.357
Should we put it on all our fingers?

36:32.562 --> 36:34.234
Just like I thought

36:37.362 --> 36:38.636
Put more here

36:41.402 --> 36:44.712
Stop asking me so many questions!

36:45.042 --> 36:47.795
She's getting mad, better hurry up
put the cream on

36:48.482 --> 36:49.756
Save some for Sol

36:49.962 --> 36:52.681
You fingers are so fat, you're just making a mess

36:53.002 --> 36:54.958
Is that all right?
Is it enough?

36:55.162 --> 36:55.655
What are you doing?

36:55.656 --> 36:56.656
Making a cake..
What does it look like?

36:57.242 --> 36:58.960
Aunt Yee, here are the candles

37:00.562 --> 37:02.234
Cover it

37:02.442 --> 37:04.284
Put the candles on then light them

37:04.285 --> 37:06.639
Ask your master to blow them out

37:06.674 --> 37:07.482
Ok Aunt

37:07.722 --> 37:09.872
Sol
My hands are all creamy

37:12.842 --> 37:13.797
I can't find it

37:14.202 --> 37:16.636
Don't hide
Come out

37:16.842 --> 37:17.371
Sister?

37:17.372 --> 37:19.072
Do you think I'm stupid?

37:19.202 --> 37:22.194
I know everything

37:25.722 --> 37:26.950
What does she know?

37:27.162 --> 37:27.950
Better go and ask her

37:27.951 --> 37:30.774
It must be something serious
or she wouldn't be crying.

37:33.682 --> 37:36.305
Master

37:37.882 --> 37:38.477
What's going on?

37:38.478 --> 37:40.670
Aunt Yee wants you to blow out the candles

37:41.082 --> 37:42.057
Ok, did she say why?

37:43.122 --> 37:46.398
Just do it and see what happens
Go on blow

37:47.322 --> 37:48.324
What's happened to your fingers?

37:48.325 --> 37:49.325
Following Aunt Yee's instructions

37:54.042 --> 37:54.830
Nothing

37:54.831 --> 37:55.754
Did you see anything?

37:56.162 --> 37:57.641
Nothing

37:57.682 --> 37:59.081
This is very mysterious

37:59.682 --> 38:02.182
Go and ask her, what does all this mean?

38:14.802 --> 38:15.663
What do you want?

38:15.664 --> 38:17.817
I'm not in a good mood,
don't make me angry

38:19.202 --> 38:21.158
She's a feisty one

38:21.482 --> 38:23.552
Lock the throat,
catch the hand, move

38:24.042 --> 38:25.521
Go to hell

38:25.682 --> 38:28.162
I told you not to bother me,
now you've asked for it

38:28.882 --> 38:31.032
Master!
Pirates!

38:31.882 --> 38:32.877
Don't move!

38:32.878 --> 38:33.742
Peony

38:33.922 --> 38:35.135
Why did you chase after me?

38:35.426 --> 38:38.393
You must tell me what is going on

38:38.442 --> 38:40.876
I don't want this ring anymore!

38:41.082 --> 38:43.502
This is your wedding ring
why are you throwing it away?

38:43.503 --> 38:44.503
Wedding ring?

38:44.562 --> 38:46.261
Wedding?
When did that happen?

38:46.562 --> 38:48.157
Why wasn't I informed?

38:49.482 --> 38:51.393
Why don't you explain this to your sister

38:51.682 --> 38:53.330
Don't just stand there,
look for the ring

38:55.082 --> 38:57.994
Clubfoot, didn't you hear?

38:58.202 --> 38:59.112
Come on Fu, Sol

38:59.442 --> 39:01.080
Sister, you've got it all wrong

39:02.922 --> 39:04.150
Dad, you've misunderstood

39:04.722 --> 39:07.156
Oh, we understand all right
- That's right

39:07.482 --> 39:10.076
We were just helping Mr Wong fix his chain

39:11.322 --> 39:13.552
Why not just say you were taking the opportunity

39:13.762 --> 39:15.225
to learn some kung fu
that's what we thought

39:15.226 --> 39:16.226
Not very convincing

39:16.882 --> 39:18.155
Dad, we didn't mean to deceive you

39:18.190 --> 39:19.008
We just didn't get the chance to tell you

39:19.009 --> 39:21.408
These words lack... lack..

39:22.562 --> 39:23.262
Sincerity

39:23.721 --> 39:24.685
Sincerity

39:25.020 --> 39:25.872
Go and ask Mr Wong

39:25.922 --> 39:27.172
You'd better ask Aunt Yee

39:27.779 --> 39:29.759
Just don't ask us

39:30.082 --> 39:31.356
We didn't do anything

39:31.802 --> 39:34.316
They were just picking beads up after all

39:35.962 --> 39:37.634
We're not really married

39:37.682 --> 39:39.092
Impossible

39:41.522 --> 39:43.399
Impossible

39:43.882 --> 39:45.861
This is Master's most embarrassing experience

39:46.642 --> 39:48.280
There's no escaping it

39:48.281 --> 39:49.360
No way

39:49.395 --> 39:50.720
Still ok?

39:51.722 --> 39:53.758
I'm still alive

39:53.802 --> 39:55.099
Do you believe me?

39:55.842 --> 39:56.973
I don't know what to believe

39:56.974 --> 39:57.201
Is he dead?

39:57.202 --> 40:00.399
Master he's not breathing

40:00.602 --> 40:01.710
Who asked him to lie there?

40:01.711 --> 40:02.711
Another one dead

40:05.162 --> 40:08.154
I told you not to play games,
now look what's happened

40:08.362 --> 40:09.158
Dad... Dad

40:10.722 --> 40:12.097
Beauty's temptation

40:12.522 --> 40:14.021
He needs professional help

40:14.022 --> 40:15.995
That the best course of action for him

40:16.722 --> 40:18.075
Very true

40:20.402 --> 40:21.697
Who will escort Aunt May back?

40:21.698 --> 40:22.698
Me... I'll do it

40:23.882 --> 40:25.897
All right, it only takes one

40:25.898 --> 40:27.106
The rest escort the pirates

40:27.107 --> 40:27.696
Right

40:27.697 --> 40:29.529
I'll protect her!
You can escort the pirates

40:29.564 --> 40:30.890
I don't need an escort

40:30.891 --> 40:31.891
I'll stay here with you

40:33.242 --> 40:36.951
And wait for the constables
to come for the pirates

40:42.722 --> 40:45.156
I'd like to ask one favour

40:45.482 --> 40:46.314
Please pretend to court me

40:46.349 --> 40:47.826
So my sister won't be angry with me

40:48.141 --> 40:49.938
I know it's a lot to ask

40:50.396 --> 40:52.027
But I have to do something

40:52.028 --> 40:53.484
It's no problem

40:53.500 --> 40:54.259
Thank you

40:54.260 --> 40:55.260
We are family, it's our obligation

40:57.722 --> 40:59.280
Make way

41:01.562 --> 41:04.918
Two days ago,
a ship was robbed on the open sea

41:05.722 --> 41:09.920
They took everything and killed all on board

41:10.122 --> 41:12.761
These are the corpses that floated back

41:12.962 --> 41:15.078
Those damn pirates!

41:30.402 --> 41:33.121
Master Wong, please check to see
if these weapons are of any use

42:00.682 --> 42:02.559
Useless foreign weapons

42:02.602 --> 42:03.796
Watch my darts!

42:05.602 --> 42:06.876
I missed...

42:47.002 --> 42:49.661
Fei Hung,
you are going to fight the pirates tomorrow

42:50.042 --> 42:52.636
We've been together a long time,
I've learnt to be flexible

42:53.602 --> 42:56.992
We can look after ourselves, don't worry

43:00.682 --> 43:01.286
Peony

43:01.287 --> 43:02.287
Sister, your turn

43:03.482 --> 43:05.359
Aunt May

43:05.562 --> 43:08.395
Fei Hung, don't worry, we'll be ok

43:09.362 --> 43:11.671
Are you worried?

43:12.002 --> 43:14.072
No, you're not worried

43:16.042 --> 43:18.112
Oh I don't know what to say!

43:18.322 --> 43:21.314
Don't worry

43:21.762 --> 43:23.081
Just go

43:25.362 --> 43:26.378
I'm done

43:26.379 --> 43:27.379
You can't even do that right

43:28.722 --> 43:32.556
Mr Porky Lang, Mr Clubfoot,
Mr Wong

44:08.242 --> 44:09.415
The sea is rough,
is there a storm coming?

44:09.648 --> 44:11.183
Maybe
- Mister Clubfoot

44:14.118 --> 44:14.818
Master

44:15.882 --> 44:18.442
Remember, call me Mister Wong

44:18.642 --> 44:19.469
Oh, yes Master

44:19.470 --> 44:21.135
Er.. Mister Master Wong

44:21.522 --> 44:24.355
Where is Mr Fu, go and find him

44:26.162 --> 44:27.932
Sol, do you have any sour plum?

44:27.933 --> 44:28.933
No

44:30.002 --> 44:33.472
Take this button
put it inside your mouth

44:33.682 --> 44:35.400
Why didn't you make some plum for me?

44:35.602 --> 44:39.038
Sea sick?
You'll be dead before we find the pirates

44:39.242 --> 44:42.120
He's going to puke again

44:47.322 --> 44:49.790
There's are some odd guys on this boat

44:50.322 --> 44:53.359
Be on your guard, they could be pirates

44:53.682 --> 44:55.673
D'ya think?

44:58.362 --> 45:00.034
Keep an eye on them

45:02.402 --> 45:02.963
It's sand

45:02.964 --> 45:04.643
You're joking?
Let me have a look

45:05.275 --> 45:06.239
They are fake

45:06.240 --> 45:07.240
It's a trap, let's go!

45:08.122 --> 45:10.352
How dare you try and cheat us?

45:11.082 --> 45:12.515
Looking for sand?

45:22.002 --> 45:22.765
That's the signal

45:22.766 --> 45:23.766
It won't be long now

45:24.642 --> 45:25.655
Still sea sick?

45:25.656 --> 45:26.656
Not through choice

45:27.962 --> 45:30.954
Because I've eaten the button
but not the plum

45:31.162 --> 45:33.676
Master wants us to gather on deck

45:48.242 --> 45:49.641
Fire!

45:53.499 --> 45:54.255
Bring her closer

45:55.084 --> 45:56.734
Prepare to board

46:00.682 --> 46:02.161
Where have they gone?

46:04.282 --> 46:05.699
We are on the same side

46:05.700 --> 46:07.178
We've tied them up already

46:08.442 --> 46:09.591
Where are the rest of them?

46:09.922 --> 46:10.934
They are tied up in the cabin

46:10.935 --> 46:13.098
If it's rice you want
there's no need to tie us up

46:13.762 --> 46:16.071
Ask your leader to come out and get the rice,
then set us free

46:16.282 --> 46:17.319
Yes, get your boss out here

46:17.320 --> 46:18.320
Now!

46:28.331 --> 46:29.391
All missed

46:29.392 --> 46:30.392
These foreign weapons are useless!

46:30.393 --> 46:31.393
Get the fat guy!

46:33.043 --> 46:33.743
After him

46:34.162 --> 46:36.437
Catch this!

46:36.762 --> 46:37.956
Now catch this!

46:38.322 --> 46:39.994
And this!

46:51.962 --> 46:53.077
Sol, careful not to shoot our people

46:53.482 --> 46:54.358
Trust me!

46:55.402 --> 46:56.517
Perfect!

47:09.682 --> 47:10.721
Clubfoot, board the other ship!

47:10.722 --> 47:11.439
Ok

47:37.842 --> 47:38.752
Hoist him up!

47:43.322 --> 47:44.994
The view's better from here

47:50.122 --> 47:51.157
Out of bullets

47:58.242 --> 47:59.704
A nice soft landing

48:03.642 --> 48:05.792
The meat is sweeter after a beating

48:17.042 --> 48:18.760
Move and you can taste you own cannonballs

48:19.082 --> 48:20.062
Get your master out here

48:20.063 --> 48:22.011
Or I'll blow the ship to bits

48:28.762 --> 48:29.672
Coming straight back!

48:30.762 --> 48:32.559
How can a rice merchant be so skilled?

48:42.562 --> 48:44.200
Are you the boss?

48:44.402 --> 48:46.916
I'm the boss...
Flying Monkey

48:47.122 --> 48:49.682
Got you!
You are under arrest!

49:00.042 --> 49:02.192
Just wait, I need to puke again

49:07.762 --> 49:09.115
I can't take much more of this

49:14.482 --> 49:16.837
Damnit, why did you die next to me?

49:28.320 --> 49:29.020
Think you can escape?

49:45.912 --> 49:47.027
Come back here!

49:48.149 --> 49:49.004
Drop you weapons!

49:49.430 --> 49:51.065
I've caught your leader

49:55.312 --> 49:58.702
They've all been killed while I was puking

50:17.472 --> 50:19.741
If what Flying Monkey said is true,
this is their base

50:19.742 --> 50:20.502
Let's go!

50:21.192 --> 50:22.278
What's that noise?

50:22.313 --> 50:23.531
I hear it too
- Me too

50:23.712 --> 50:24.412
It's a lyre

50:27.072 --> 50:28.710
Let's disguise ourselves and sneak in

50:32.792 --> 50:34.384
We need to draw their attention away

50:43.632 --> 50:44.382
Let's go

50:51.272 --> 50:53.422
It's done Master

50:53.423 --> 50:54.423
Ok

50:59.232 --> 51:01.223
Help...
Help me...

51:04.401 --> 51:07.228
Master, there are so many pirates here

51:11.632 --> 51:14.305
Do you think they'll recognise us?

51:14.712 --> 51:15.986
Do you remember how many pigs you've slaughtered?

51:16.192 --> 51:18.696
I've slaughtered so many,
how could I remember?

51:18.731 --> 51:21.229
They have so many new members,
how will they tell us from them?

51:21.264 --> 51:22.164
Just stay calm

51:22.199 --> 51:23.502
Ok

51:23.752 --> 51:25.157
Lang, you worry too much

51:25.158 --> 51:25.858
Yes... yes... yes

51:25.872 --> 51:27.510
No need to repeat yourself

51:36.832 --> 51:37.947
Is San Francisco a beautiful city?

51:38.152 --> 51:39.453
Not at all

51:39.488 --> 51:42.206
I bought a plot in New York instead

51:42.992 --> 51:45.008
Paris is better, you should see the girls!

51:45.009 --> 51:46.409
I bought a chateau there

51:46.672 --> 51:48.565
And I've employed many maids

51:48.566 --> 51:50.436
I could go anytime and live like a king

51:50.471 --> 51:51.945
I never thought making big money
would be so easy!

51:52.152 --> 51:54.589
If I'd started earlier
I could have retired by now

51:54.590 --> 51:55.191
Cheers!

51:55.192 --> 51:55.892
Cheers!

52:00.992 --> 52:02.485
They all drink this

52:02.486 --> 52:03.486
It must taste good

52:04.872 --> 52:06.489
It's so frothy, how can we drink it?

52:06.490 --> 52:07.490
Just try it

52:09.832 --> 52:10.878
It's bitter and stinks

52:10.879 --> 52:11.679
He's lovin' it

52:11.832 --> 52:14.107
He must have a different one

52:14.312 --> 52:15.791
Let me try yours

52:18.432 --> 52:19.785
Just the same

52:25.312 --> 52:27.133
Bravo!
Sister Ying plays so well!

52:27.134 --> 52:28.134
Let's offer her a toast!

52:28.592 --> 52:31.902
Under her great leadership
we've had much success this year

52:32.112 --> 52:33.750
Those not drinking show disrespect to Sister Ying

52:33.952 --> 52:34.907
To Sister Ying!

52:37.672 --> 52:39.788
You better be careful

52:39.992 --> 52:41.345
This wine tastes foul

52:41.552 --> 52:42.703
Clubfoot, listen up

52:43.725 --> 52:45.599
Add some of this into the barrels

52:45.832 --> 52:47.982
It will make them feel even better for a while

52:48.192 --> 52:50.778
Sol, light the gunpowder on my signal,
ok?

52:50.779 --> 52:51.779
Let's go!

52:58.992 --> 53:00.823
What is this?
It tastes like horse piss!

53:01.672 --> 53:03.344
Master, look!

53:05.312 --> 53:06.665
The women who were kidnapped

53:06.872 --> 53:10.023
We can't risk hurting innocents,
so we can't use the gunpowder

53:11.072 --> 53:13.142
We have to save them first

53:13.472 --> 53:15.588
Ying is coming, what should we do?

53:15.792 --> 53:16.861
Let's get up for now

53:19.352 --> 53:20.179
Where are you men from?

53:21.429 --> 53:23.380
Are you new to us?

53:23.712 --> 53:25.703
I've been here for ages,
just enjoying my beer!

53:27.552 --> 53:30.749
We came from Bonero,
we're under Flying Monkey

53:30.952 --> 53:32.624
Flying Monkey?

53:32.832 --> 53:35.744
He's already set sail.
Why are you still here?

53:37.792 --> 53:40.181
He knows we lack experience

53:40.392 --> 53:43.629
He wanted us to stay until the next job

53:43.630 --> 53:45.337
Understand?

53:46.552 --> 53:49.191
Shit, you've got some guts!

53:49.392 --> 53:52.464
Flying Monkey does what I say,
so do you!

53:52.672 --> 53:53.408
Understand?!

53:53.409 --> 53:54.409
Nice one!

53:55.432 --> 53:57.104
Master is too much

53:57.632 --> 53:59.588
Someone is coming

53:59.912 --> 54:01.557
It's me, aren't I fat enough to recognise?

54:01.558 --> 54:03.174
Fatty, you made me jump!

54:03.209 --> 54:04.790
Master is in Ying's bedroom

54:04.791 --> 54:05.491
What?

54:05.632 --> 54:06.484
He lost control again

54:07.100 --> 54:08.286
What shall we do then?

54:08.592 --> 54:12.107
He really needs to make his mind up

54:12.552 --> 54:15.908
If he doesn't got on top of it
he'll blame us for not keeping up

54:16.112 --> 54:17.864
So hurry up and fix the medicine

54:19.112 --> 54:21.945
We rarely see skin as white as yours here

54:23.792 --> 54:24.492
Young man

54:25.191 --> 54:26.464
You seem tense,
are you still a virgin?

54:27.312 --> 54:28.108
Yes

54:28.432 --> 54:29.899
I don't believe you

54:30.654 --> 54:32.009
There are no virgins anymore

54:32.392 --> 54:35.065
I've certainly never met one

54:40.432 --> 54:42.263
Wong Fei Hung, I know you have it in for me

54:42.472 --> 54:44.702
I recognised you the moment you walked in

54:45.512 --> 54:46.852
Well, you had it in for me too

54:46.853 --> 54:47.853
You knew I was Wong Fei Hung

54:48.232 --> 54:49.711
But still fell into my hands

54:50.032 --> 54:52.144
So slow!
- Just a little more

54:52.145 --> 54:53.145
Come on, hurry up!

54:53.592 --> 54:55.628
I don't think it matters anymore

54:55.952 --> 54:58.466
Why?
Is Master coming?

54:58.515 --> 54:59.515
What? Does he not look happy?

54:59.516 --> 55:00.245
One

55:00.712 --> 55:01.669
Why are you counting?
- Two

55:01.670 --> 55:02.370
Three!

55:39.472 --> 55:41.419
Damn you Wong Fei Hung!

55:41.420 --> 55:42.163
Watch my gun!

55:42.712 --> 55:44.623
Ying, you are under arrest!

55:53.632 --> 55:55.031
So many of them

55:55.072 --> 55:58.064
This will hold them

56:07.192 --> 56:08.604
No way!

56:09.190 --> 56:09.890
Watch this!

56:13.672 --> 56:16.232
You broke the pillar!
Are you trying to kill me?

56:16.432 --> 56:17.467
What were you doing up there anyway?

56:23.872 --> 56:26.830
Shoot and load... Shoot and load
It's such a pain!

56:56.152 --> 56:57.301
No time to refill

56:57.792 --> 57:00.022
Sol... Catch!
- Holy shit!

57:04.432 --> 57:05.968
I have great confidence in you!

57:06.369 --> 57:07.069
Thank you

57:07.232 --> 57:08.506
Sneaking up?
Take this!

57:11.552 --> 57:12.746
Eighteen Topple Kick!

57:16.392 --> 57:18.667
I kick with style when Clubfoot's not around

57:21.872 --> 57:22.861
Watch my darts!

57:25.792 --> 57:28.067
10,000 for a corpse, 7000 for the wounded

57:28.272 --> 57:30.069
Right!
10,000 for you!

57:43.672 --> 57:44.997
Sol you are the best shot

57:44.998 --> 57:46.026
Cover me!

57:47.192 --> 57:48.545
I wasn't ready!

57:53.352 --> 57:54.307
Sol, what are you doing?

57:56.312 --> 57:58.303
So many guns!

57:59.312 --> 58:00.267
Run!

58:03.952 --> 58:05.414
Not so hard!

58:05.415 --> 58:06.415
I'm not a faker like you!

58:06.552 --> 58:07.746
Didn't you see my 18 Topple Kick?

58:13.592 --> 58:15.150
Wah! That's not a real stance!

58:17.752 --> 58:19.344
Take this...

58:25.312 --> 58:26.950
And some of this...

58:29.672 --> 58:31.888
I'd be stronger,
if it weren't for the sea sickness

58:31.889 --> 58:32.889
One more!

58:36.752 --> 58:37.787
Ambush!

58:43.152 --> 58:45.950
Lang!
What a waste of energy!

58:46.152 --> 58:48.586
If some iron fell from the sky
would you stop it with your head?

58:54.552 --> 58:57.783
Safe for one,
dangerous to another!

59:02.112 --> 59:03.307
Club... foot

59:03.308 --> 59:04.308
Quiet!

59:06.592 --> 59:08.548
It's too dangerous to move

59:08.752 --> 59:10.583
Then why are you pushing me?

59:10.792 --> 59:12.987
You said
"One man's danger is another man's safety"

59:13.192 --> 59:14.511
This is only danger!
- So what?

59:14.872 --> 59:15.907
Stop arguing

59:16.112 --> 59:17.340
This is tactical discussion not arguing!

59:17.952 --> 59:20.102
Stop talking and move!

59:20.312 --> 59:21.631
Are you going or not?

59:23.924 --> 59:24.624
Sol

59:24.803 --> 59:26.226
Clubfoot, use the box as cover!

59:27.512 --> 59:28.547
Got it!

59:37.752 --> 59:38.867
Master, you can come in now

59:39.312 --> 59:40.267
Attack!

59:42.992 --> 59:44.107
What's with you?

59:46.752 --> 59:48.947
Wah! Heaven has finally rewarded us
for our good deeds!

59:49.352 --> 59:51.024
We're rich!

59:59.152 --> 01:00:00.904
I'm not a greedy man, I just want a little

01:00:01.832 --> 01:00:02.628
Fu

01:00:02.952 --> 01:00:04.379
Master, let me collect your share

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.380
This does not belong to you

01:00:06.952 --> 01:00:08.863
We must take all this back to the court

01:00:09.992 --> 01:00:11.584
What? Pretending to be Mr. Honest

01:00:11.792 --> 01:00:13.430
Hey Fatty, why did you take so much?!

01:00:14.832 --> 01:00:17.300
Clubfoot!
Why did you take so much?!

01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:19.123
I'm just looking,
I wasn't taking anything

01:00:19.612 --> 01:00:20.271
Sol

01:00:20.272 --> 01:00:21.705
I didn't do anything

01:00:22.672 --> 01:00:23.707
Got it now...

01:00:26.112 --> 01:00:28.342
Fu! Is that your necklace?

01:00:29.912 --> 01:00:31.504
Just stuck to my hand

01:00:36.512 --> 01:00:37.945
Watch out for traps

01:00:39.752 --> 01:00:42.425
Master, this appears to be Cheung's tablet

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:47.341
Machine gun

01:00:47.912 --> 01:00:49.231
Cheung

01:00:49.872 --> 01:00:53.865
You have chosen to be a pirate in death too

01:00:54.072 --> 01:00:56.745
Such a disgrace to set a tablet to your
"Glorious history"

01:00:57.072 --> 01:01:00.030
Your descendants are ruining
our peace and stability

01:01:00.312 --> 01:01:02.109
I must destroy your base now

01:01:02.312 --> 01:01:04.223
And I will break your tablet!

01:01:09.392 --> 01:01:11.542
How dare you defile my throne?

01:01:14.512 --> 01:01:15.422
Save Fu

01:01:16.432 --> 01:01:17.467
Fu, watch out!

01:01:17.672 --> 01:01:19.663
Let him go!

01:01:27.432 --> 01:01:28.911
My hand!

01:01:29.112 --> 01:01:29.829
He did that on purpose

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:30.830
You were too greedy

01:01:32.632 --> 01:01:34.384
How dare you kick me?

01:01:34.712 --> 01:01:36.145
My foot!

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:37.866
You old fox!

01:01:40.952 --> 01:01:42.146
Clubfoot, get away!

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.226
I'll break your leg now

01:01:44.227 --> 01:01:45.227
Come out here then

01:01:57.192 --> 01:01:58.910
Clubfoot, how are you?

01:02:08.952 --> 01:02:09.862
Are you Cheung?

01:02:10.192 --> 01:02:13.787
Didn't you see the tablet on my throne?

01:02:14.872 --> 01:02:16.385
Can you really be that old?

01:02:16.712 --> 01:02:19.306
I'm selfish and crafty

01:02:19.512 --> 01:02:23.221
I eat and sleep well
so I enjoy long life

01:02:23.632 --> 01:02:24.843
You are too conceited!

01:02:25.418 --> 01:02:26.341
Your life's about to change

01:02:26.832 --> 01:02:27.947
I'm taking you to the court

01:02:28.272 --> 01:02:33.392
Too conceited?
You made me an officer so you can't arrest me

01:02:33.592 --> 01:02:37.585
My post is quite a senior one

01:02:38.192 --> 01:02:41.787
But I have no desire to become the Magistrate

01:02:42.312 --> 01:02:44.348
Do you think you can be an official forever?

01:02:44.672 --> 01:02:47.266
Once you stepped outside the law
it was over

01:02:47.712 --> 01:02:49.543
You've had it too easy

01:02:50.712 --> 01:02:52.350
Excellent, you have guts

01:02:52.672 --> 01:02:53.649
Someone...

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:54.591
...is hiding

01:02:54.592 --> 01:02:55.192
What?

01:02:55.193 --> 01:02:55.893
Hiding

01:02:55.896 --> 01:02:56.596
Hiding?

01:02:57.512 --> 01:03:02.791
My descendants and I
have no respect for officials

01:03:02.992 --> 01:03:05.586
All the Emperors are selfish

01:03:06.112 --> 01:03:08.785
If you say I shouldn't wear this official hat

01:03:08.992 --> 01:03:11.825
Then cut the ponytails from the Manchu's for me

01:03:12.152 --> 01:03:14.029
Ok, come here and cut it yourself

01:03:48.112 --> 01:03:49.797
Sol, lend me your gun

01:03:50.312 --> 01:03:52.826
I need to use it

01:03:53.152 --> 01:03:55.268
Never mind, I'll use that big one there

01:04:00.552 --> 01:04:02.429
This is your fault Sol!
Now I'm trapped

01:04:02.752 --> 01:04:03.574
Go.. Go

01:04:04.576 --> 01:04:05.276
Load the gun

01:04:07.512 --> 01:04:10.026
Let me help you
- Hurry up

01:04:10.832 --> 01:04:12.137
Come on, hurry!

01:04:12.138 --> 01:04:13.262
You're in the way,
how can I get out?

01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:14.287
Sorry I can't move

01:04:14.288 --> 01:04:15.288
Watch out!

01:04:17.632 --> 01:04:19.702
Luckily I have enough ass to spare
No problem

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:36.869
Ah, my hand!

01:04:54.517 --> 01:04:55.217
Vases

01:04:56.439 --> 01:04:58.427
You can't balance on there

01:04:59.772 --> 01:05:00.940
Give me your ponytail

01:05:00.975 --> 01:05:01.845
Come and get it

01:05:03.072 --> 01:05:04.968
Think you can challenge my "Sea Balance" kung fu!

01:05:04.969 --> 01:05:05.837
Right Cheung

01:05:05.872 --> 01:05:08.022
Let's see who falls first

01:05:25.872 --> 01:05:27.988
Give me your hat

01:05:28.312 --> 01:05:30.189
On the floor

01:05:37.152 --> 01:05:39.871
You can't protect your hat,
how do you expect to cut my ponytail?

01:05:40.192 --> 01:05:42.407
I'm satisfied with the riches I have,
the hat means nothing!

01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:46.063
Come and take my head if you can!

01:05:57.432 --> 01:05:58.751
I'm gonna chop your legs off!

01:06:07.312 --> 01:06:09.223
Back on the floor

01:06:11.152 --> 01:06:12.551
You're coming too

01:06:19.632 --> 01:06:22.749
Watch your diamonds,
if that's what you want!

01:06:23.232 --> 01:06:24.904
Here, take it!

01:06:27.432 --> 01:06:29.468
No!
My diamonds!

01:07:17.192 --> 01:07:19.023
You lived for riches

01:07:19.232 --> 01:07:21.268
Now you have been killed by them

01:07:21.472 --> 01:07:24.225
Ford, clean the sign

01:07:26.032 --> 01:07:27.592
Move everything inside

01:07:27.593 --> 01:07:28.293
Coming

01:07:28.472 --> 01:07:32.784
Goddess, please bless and protect us

01:07:32.992 --> 01:07:34.505
Burn the fire crackers

01:07:37.992 --> 01:07:40.028
Be quiet

01:07:48.352 --> 01:07:49.944
What's this?

01:07:50.152 --> 01:07:51.114
It stinks

01:07:51.115 --> 01:07:52.115
Let me help you

01:07:52.432 --> 01:07:53.626
Never mind

01:07:53.832 --> 01:07:56.117
Clubfoot, hold tight,
I'm going to treat your wound now

01:07:56.118 --> 01:07:57.118
Thank you Master

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:01.950
Sol, come and help,
Master and sister are here

01:08:02.152 --> 01:08:03.346
Pretend to court me ok

01:08:03.552 --> 01:08:05.370
Aunt May

01:08:05.405 --> 01:08:07.097
Let me have a look,
it's all right

01:08:07.132 --> 01:08:07.832
Sol

01:08:08.104 --> 01:08:09.239
What's wrong with you?

01:08:09.681 --> 01:08:10.381
Right, I'm fine
it's nothing

01:08:11.312 --> 01:08:12.153
Do you want to be hurt?

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:12.933
Aunt May

01:08:14.192 --> 01:08:16.706
Pretend you're courting me

01:08:17.432 --> 01:08:20.026
Aunt May

01:08:24.286 --> 01:08:26.712
Lang's in a really bad way,
just listen to his groans

01:08:28.192 --> 01:08:30.386
Aunt May

01:08:30.952 --> 01:08:32.023
I'm coming

01:08:33.272 --> 01:08:36.469
Why is everybody suddenly calling Aunt May?

01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:39.511
It's because she's so nice to them

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.350
Fu, pretend to be enamoured by me

01:08:41.671 --> 01:08:42.608
I really am

01:08:44.523 --> 01:08:45.823
I'm not joking

01:08:46.192 --> 01:08:47.705
I'm being sincere

01:08:47.912 --> 01:08:48.612
Sincere?

01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:49.013
Yes

01:08:49.014 --> 01:08:50.014
We agreed to pretend

01:08:50.591 --> 01:08:53.504
You can pretend but I'm serious

01:08:54.352 --> 01:08:55.438
I'll just go on pretending

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:56.301
Make it more realistic

01:08:56.336 --> 01:08:56.881
I'm just pretending

01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:57.667
Come on, it's just acting

01:08:59.392 --> 01:09:03.703
I'll pretend but don't get the wrong idea

01:09:08.992 --> 01:09:11.745
It's hard to pretend,
there's no need for you to do this

01:09:11.952 --> 01:09:13.627
What do you know?

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:20.504
Boss

01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:24.102
Empty!
They took everything

01:09:33.352 --> 01:09:35.308
I never thought this place would come alive again

01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:37.582
The people are full of hope now

01:09:37.792 --> 01:09:39.703
I didn't think the Tin Hau Festival would happen

01:09:40.032 --> 01:09:42.466
Now the local militia are respected

01:09:42.671 --> 01:09:44.742
So many people want to join

01:09:45.752 --> 01:09:50.381
Mr Tse, what will we do with the jewellery
we recovered from the pirates

01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:51.707
Let's follow the governmental orders

01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:52.709
The Government?

01:09:53.432 --> 01:09:55.309
Roll Up, roll up!
Get it while you can!

01:09:55.632 --> 01:09:59.227
The price will rise tomorrow,
only two left now

01:10:05.632 --> 01:10:06.826
What's the matter?

01:10:07.032 --> 01:10:09.630
The merchant's are causing a crisis,
the price of rice increases each day

01:10:09.732 --> 01:10:11.364
What are they up to?

01:10:11.365 --> 01:10:14.134
They're going to scare the people again

01:10:14.512 --> 01:10:16.206
The rice is so expensive,
we can't afford to buy it

01:10:16.207 --> 01:10:18.193
In that case go home

01:10:18.528 --> 01:10:19.831
Yes, what can I do for you?

01:10:20.032 --> 01:10:23.547
Master Wong,
with your help we are making a fortune!

01:10:23.792 --> 01:10:26.101
How can you auction rice like treasure?

01:10:26.312 --> 01:10:29.987
If I keep my rice in the barn
I'll make a terrible loss

01:10:30.232 --> 01:10:34.191
I have a monopoly on the rice
so I can sell to the highest bidder

01:10:34.392 --> 01:10:38.783
You should watch and learn about business from me

01:10:39.032 --> 01:10:40.930
Business?
Aren't you just another pirate?

01:10:41.465 --> 01:10:43.544
You are just robbing the people

01:10:43.879 --> 01:10:45.522
This is legal, I'm not robbing anybody

01:10:45.523 --> 01:10:46.523
It's up to them to buy or not

01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:48.948
If we don't buy rice,
how can we survive?

01:10:49.152 --> 01:10:54.510
This is too good a business opportunity to miss

01:10:54.712 --> 01:10:58.830
First bitter, then sweet,
that's the Law of Prosperity

01:10:59.032 --> 01:11:01.023
Keep working or I'll dock your pay!

01:11:01.232 --> 01:11:03.200
Advisor, find some cheap labour
to carry all this rice

01:11:03.201 --> 01:11:03.871
Yes Boss

01:11:03.872 --> 01:11:05.749
When rice goes up, all other prices follow

01:11:05.952 --> 01:11:07.783
Master Wong

01:11:34.792 --> 01:11:37.101
Celebrating eh!

01:11:39.592 --> 01:11:42.470
While they are celebrating the festival

01:11:42.952 --> 01:11:45.102
Let's go and rob Si Kiu

01:11:45.312 --> 01:11:48.987
Kill everyone in one night

01:11:49.512 --> 01:11:53.505
A fitting revenge for my father

01:11:57.195 --> 01:11:57.956
Where is Ying?

01:11:58.347 --> 01:11:59.693
Locked up in the prison

01:12:01.432 --> 01:12:02.806
Send somebody to save her

01:12:02.807 --> 01:12:03.507
Yes

01:12:21.912 --> 01:12:24.426
They are here, let's send the signal

01:12:30.352 --> 01:12:32.741
There's the signal now

01:12:33.512 --> 01:12:36.504
You were right Master Wong
they did exactly what you predicted

01:12:38.552 --> 01:12:40.543
Send the signal to inform our men

01:12:40.752 --> 01:12:41.216
Ken

01:12:41.217 --> 01:12:42.094
Yes Sir

01:12:42.095 --> 01:12:42.795
The torch

01:12:50.152 --> 01:12:52.204
Ok, they are coming,
let's start the dragon dance

01:12:52.588 --> 01:12:53.926
We'll draw them right in

01:13:04.392 --> 01:13:07.543
Dad, this place is under your control,
take care

01:13:07.752 --> 01:13:09.629
Thanks, you too

01:13:19.992 --> 01:13:22.552
Are you all right?
Answer me!

01:13:22.752 --> 01:13:24.071
We are trapped, go!

01:13:29.952 --> 01:13:33.103
What's happening outside?
Will they burn the house?

01:13:33.312 --> 01:13:34.745
Shhh, be quiet

01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:39.949
Sister

01:13:41.312 --> 01:13:44.349
Sister, about Fei Hung...

01:13:45.432 --> 01:13:46.831
Let's talk about it later

01:13:53.792 --> 01:13:55.908
Are you the barn advisor?

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:57.348
That's right

01:13:57.672 --> 01:13:59.025
Where's your boss?

01:14:01.352 --> 01:14:03.502
He is guarding the barn alone

01:14:03.712 --> 01:14:06.510
What about his wife and children?

01:14:06.872 --> 01:14:07.907
They are with him

01:14:26.392 --> 01:14:28.667
Why did you shout so loudly,
you scared me half to death

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:32.423
Mr Tang!
It's Master Wong's Aunt Yee

01:14:34.432 --> 01:14:36.343
It's not safe here,
you shouldn't be hiding inside

01:14:36.552 --> 01:14:38.429
You'd better come with us now

01:14:38.912 --> 01:14:40.425
We'd better do as Master Wong says

01:14:40.632 --> 01:14:42.270
He can't tell me what to do!

01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:44.305
Why have you come here?

01:14:44.512 --> 01:14:48.221
You won't protect my rice so I'll do it myself

01:14:48.592 --> 01:14:51.106
They'll have to kill me if they want it!

01:14:51.712 --> 01:14:55.182
Mr Tang, rice is important
but your lives are more important

01:14:55.392 --> 01:14:58.828
Spare a thought for your family

01:14:59.032 --> 01:15:01.387
Your children are still young,
can they fight against pirates?

01:15:01.592 --> 01:15:02.911
Open the door!

01:15:08.952 --> 01:15:10.385
Listen to Ah An

01:15:11.312 --> 01:15:14.588
Ah An, take good care of them

01:15:14.952 --> 01:15:18.547
Sister, you don't need to stay,
follow them

01:15:18.792 --> 01:15:21.348
You are still young,
you have a bright future

01:15:21.829 --> 01:15:23.967
You needn't follow Master like I do

01:15:24.002 --> 01:15:24.812
I won't go

01:15:24.813 --> 01:15:25.666
Sister, you'd better go

01:15:25.667 --> 01:15:26.667
Let me stay with Master

01:15:26.992 --> 01:15:28.811
Sister, please go now

01:15:28.812 --> 01:15:29.812
Don't make me go

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:32.064
Mistress!!

01:15:36.552 --> 01:15:38.110
Don't leave me all alone

01:15:56.872 --> 01:15:58.891
My stomach hurts, I need to go to the toilet

01:15:58.892 --> 01:15:59.892
Hurry up

01:16:36.832 --> 01:16:39.551
Brother Lang,
there's a signal from Gut Cheung Lane

01:16:40.272 --> 01:16:43.344
There are signals coming from everywhere
so why is it so quiet here

01:16:52.992 --> 01:16:55.506
Thank God... Just in time!

01:17:18.032 --> 01:17:19.704
On the roof!

01:17:23.752 --> 01:17:26.107
Drop your swords

01:17:26.352 --> 01:17:28.024
These are guns

01:17:47.096 --> 01:17:48.010
Who... Who's there?

01:17:55.472 --> 01:17:57.064
Damn! No more bullets

01:18:13.192 --> 01:18:14.227
Damn you!

01:18:21.232 --> 01:18:23.348
Cover me so I can find the Boss

01:18:23.672 --> 01:18:24.751
Sister Ying, here's your cover

01:18:25.122 --> 01:18:25.822
Damn, there's somebody here

01:18:33.672 --> 01:18:34.582
What are you doing?

01:18:40.592 --> 01:18:42.071
They're all running away

01:18:44.512 --> 01:18:45.786
Enjoy yourself!

01:18:47.039 --> 01:18:47.983
Out of bullets

01:18:52.872 --> 01:18:54.066
Ying has escaped

01:18:59.192 --> 01:19:01.422
Boss, the dragon is controlled with ropes
it's a trap

01:19:08.672 --> 01:19:09.866
Good boy!

01:19:10.272 --> 01:19:12.263
You are as faithful as a dog!

01:19:12.472 --> 01:19:13.666
Give me a piece of bone

01:19:16.232 --> 01:19:17.904
You can take the bone home

01:19:18.112 --> 01:19:20.262
Go on, there's a good boy

01:19:20.832 --> 01:19:22.185
Come on...

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:25.625
Are you coming?

01:19:26.912 --> 01:19:27.959
Are you staring at me?

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.960
He's giving me a hard stare

01:19:29.272 --> 01:19:30.661
He looks like an owl

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:34.907
What?
D'ya think I'm scared?

01:19:35.112 --> 01:19:37.865
Let's see whose eyes are bigger

01:19:38.792 --> 01:19:40.305
Are you one of Wong Fei Hung's students?

01:19:40.632 --> 01:19:42.702
Don't you recognise me?
The day we raided your base

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:45.426
You must have been running for cover

01:19:45.632 --> 01:19:47.702
Forget it, I'll give you another chance

01:19:48.072 --> 01:19:49.664
To get to know me

01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:51.146
I want to get to know your insides first!

01:19:52.872 --> 01:19:54.225
Using my bone?

01:20:02.912 --> 01:20:04.789
Use the machine gun

01:20:06.632 --> 01:20:07.382
Take cover!

01:20:08.752 --> 01:20:09.944
It's not working

01:20:09.945 --> 01:20:11.526
You have to take the safety off!

01:20:14.912 --> 01:20:16.311
Still not working

01:20:16.992 --> 01:20:18.584
Don't you know how to use a machine gun?

01:20:28.152 --> 01:20:29.221
Oh shit!

01:20:31.792 --> 01:20:32.738
Master!

01:20:33.081 --> 01:20:33.781
Wong Fei Hung?

01:20:47.352 --> 01:20:49.441
Quick, don't let those bastards escape

01:20:49.442 --> 01:20:50.442
Wait for me!

01:20:51.352 --> 01:20:52.532
I must avenge my father!

01:20:52.533 --> 01:20:53.533
I'm waiting for you

01:21:12.032 --> 01:21:12.908
Go to Hell!

01:21:35.192 --> 01:21:37.069
Watch my "No Shadow Kick"

01:21:47.192 --> 01:21:50.150
You finally show up...
Cheung junior

01:21:53.632 --> 01:21:54.937
I've come specially for you

01:21:54.938 --> 01:21:55.938
Well, here I am

01:21:58.312 --> 01:21:59.556
Sister Ying, Boss is over here

01:21:59.557 --> 01:22:00.557
Boss, we have escaped

01:22:04.432 --> 01:22:05.262
Catch the rope

01:22:09.432 --> 01:22:10.419
Think you can escape?

01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:11.931
Catch the gun!

01:22:13.472 --> 01:22:15.110
Master, here's a rope

01:22:20.432 --> 01:22:21.590
Clubfoot, come here

01:22:21.591 --> 01:22:22.591
Yes Master

01:22:24.232 --> 01:22:25.870
Wong Fei Hung, catch my firework!

01:22:28.312 --> 01:22:30.587
Clubfoot

01:22:33.352 --> 01:22:34.944
Master

01:22:59.432 --> 01:23:01.548
Leave, quickly,
don't worry about me

01:23:11.912 --> 01:23:13.391
Ying, are you all right?

01:23:13.592 --> 01:23:14.294
I'm fine

01:23:15.222 --> 01:23:16.452
We seem to be in a barn

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:26.942
I asked you for rice, you didn't oblige me

01:23:29.392 --> 01:23:30.092
Come here

01:23:30.751 --> 01:23:31.779
Please let me go

01:23:33.992 --> 01:23:35.471
Don't take my rice away, please don't

01:23:35.672 --> 01:23:38.232
You still want to protect your barn?

01:23:38.432 --> 01:23:39.387
Kill them!

01:23:41.072 --> 01:23:42.027
Boss

01:23:42.472 --> 01:23:44.144
My rice, my precious rice...

01:23:47.592 --> 01:23:49.344
We have to save them all

01:23:54.952 --> 01:23:57.420
Say good bye to your husband!

01:23:58.152 --> 01:23:59.631
Take your rice to the King of Hell

01:24:01.552 --> 01:24:02.252
Sister Ying!

01:24:09.272 --> 01:24:09.730
What's going on?

01:24:09.731 --> 01:24:10.731
Cheung junior!

01:24:20.352 --> 01:24:22.149
Master Wong, you came?

01:24:23.472 --> 01:24:24.587
Kill him!

01:24:30.272 --> 01:24:31.671
What the...

01:24:34.112 --> 01:24:35.830
Who is it, who's there?

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:37.107
Wong Fei Hung

01:24:37.432 --> 01:24:38.990
Damn you Wong Fei Hung!

01:24:40.432 --> 01:24:41.132
Wait

01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:43.028
Catch those bitches first

01:24:43.232 --> 01:24:44.126
Don't let them escape

01:24:44.127 --> 01:24:45.197
The rest of you, surround them!

01:24:45.198 --> 01:24:45.898
Right

01:24:48.032 --> 01:24:49.829
Why are you tying me up?

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.671
Go now!

01:24:57.112 --> 01:24:58.511
Get them!

01:24:59.672 --> 01:25:00.811
It's too high up

01:25:01.148 --> 01:25:01.848
Let me help!

01:25:03.912 --> 01:25:06.267
Go now!
I'll save your wife

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:38.732
Come this way!

01:25:40.632 --> 01:25:41.951
Hurry up!

01:25:42.312 --> 01:25:43.427
Aren't you going?

01:25:50.552 --> 01:25:52.588
Quick, open the door, hurry up!

01:25:54.512 --> 01:25:56.548
Hurry, quickly!

01:26:05.592 --> 01:26:07.593
Help!
Pirates!

01:26:11.712 --> 01:26:12.861
Master, come down

01:26:13.632 --> 01:26:14.985
Come on

01:26:15.592 --> 01:26:17.230
Be careful!

01:26:19.752 --> 01:26:21.103
Master! Are you all right?

01:26:21.104 --> 01:26:22.649
Help me! Help me!

01:26:50.952 --> 01:26:52.431
Where is Wong Fei Hung?

01:26:52.632 --> 01:26:54.184
I can't see him

01:26:54.781 --> 01:26:55.913
Let me shoot you!

01:27:05.712 --> 01:27:06.462
My eyes!

01:27:07.672 --> 01:27:08.707
Don't move!

01:27:09.512 --> 01:27:12.026
Drop your weapons or your boss dies!

01:27:20.672 --> 01:27:21.741
On fire?!

01:27:22.672 --> 01:27:24.264
Go to hell!

01:27:31.552 --> 01:27:33.861
Ying, I will avenge you!

01:27:35.952 --> 01:27:37.544
Think you can get away!

01:27:48.672 --> 01:27:50.469
The barn is on fire!

01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:53.624
There's nothing we can do

01:27:55.592 --> 01:27:59.346
Sir, the rice, it will be burnt to a cinder...

01:28:01.752 --> 01:28:03.743
There are many soldiers outside,
let's hide up for now

01:28:05.592 --> 01:28:07.548
Save the rice Sir, I beg you!

01:28:07.872 --> 01:28:09.988
We can't let the rice burn

01:28:11.312 --> 01:28:12.243
I'm going to save it!

01:28:12.244 --> 01:28:13.037
Ken!

01:28:13.072 --> 01:28:14.391
Thank you! Be quick!

01:28:21.352 --> 01:28:22.012
Let's save the rice!

01:28:22.013 --> 01:28:23.013
Thank you!

01:28:26.872 --> 01:28:27.758
What shall we do?

01:28:27.759 --> 01:28:28.759
Follow me!

01:28:31.432 --> 01:28:33.184
Ken! Where are you??

01:28:34.752 --> 01:28:35.946
There are pirates!

01:28:38.954 --> 01:28:40.063
I'll handle this

01:28:51.072 --> 01:28:54.064
Ken!!

01:28:55.352 --> 01:28:57.104
Die bastard!!

01:28:57.312 --> 01:29:01.066
Ken, wake up, wake up!

01:29:01.832 --> 01:29:05.745
Wake up, get up and save the rice!

01:29:06.112 --> 01:29:07.704
Ken!

01:29:12.592 --> 01:29:14.583
Save the rice

01:29:27.432 --> 01:29:28.945
At last, they've come

01:29:32.483 --> 01:29:33.920
Be careful, he's got a gun

01:29:34.072 --> 01:29:34.772
Come on

01:29:35.845 --> 01:29:36.545
Come on!

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:38.107
Porky Lang

01:29:40.152 --> 01:29:41.310
He's Cheung Yuk Lun!

01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:42.011
Don't move!

01:29:45.792 --> 01:29:47.669
Gun powder?!

01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:50.028
I'll blow you all to hell!

01:29:52.992 --> 01:29:55.142
Die bastard!

01:29:56.152 --> 01:29:57.152
Damn you!

01:29:57.153 --> 01:29:58.099
Move!

01:29:58.352 --> 01:29:59.865
Catch this!

01:30:06.232 --> 01:30:07.062
Take cover!

01:30:45.512 --> 01:30:47.662
Watch out!

01:30:52.712 --> 01:30:54.509
We'll die together!

01:30:57.192 --> 01:30:58.386
Watch out!

01:31:07.632 --> 01:31:08.790
No explosion?

01:31:08.791 --> 01:31:09.791
The gunpowder has burnt out

01:31:10.232 --> 01:31:11.460
Gun!

01:31:15.072 --> 01:31:16.824
I've got em!

01:31:18.352 --> 01:31:20.618
Wong Fei Hung!

01:31:20.912 --> 01:31:22.948
Prepare to die!

01:31:23.272 --> 01:31:24.944
Cheung Yuk Lun, watch out!

01:31:48.832 --> 01:31:52.950
The more unstable the society,
the more opportunity for profit

01:31:53.232 --> 01:31:56.304
All the prices go up

01:31:56.832 --> 01:32:00.222
And there are fortunes to be made

01:32:01.512 --> 01:32:05.027
Heroes appear in troubled times

01:32:05.672 --> 01:32:08.664
That's the time to strike it rich

01:32:10.152 --> 01:32:12.712
Prosperity...

01:32:13.872 --> 01:32:17.751
Has gone up in smoke,
there's nothing left

01:32:18.072 --> 01:32:20.872
So we are finally going to make it to Hong Kong

01:32:20.873 --> 01:32:21.573
Yes

01:32:21.872 --> 01:32:22.902
Let us help you with your luggage

01:32:22.903 --> 01:32:23.903
Thank you

01:32:25.272 --> 01:32:26.460
Are you leaving today?

01:32:26.461 --> 01:32:28.806
Somebody will come from the capital
to take over today

01:32:29.072 --> 01:32:31.870
Excellent, everything will return to normal,
law and order will be restored

01:32:32.072 --> 01:32:33.278
Yes, that's right

01:32:33.279 --> 01:32:34.279
Sir...

01:32:34.609 --> 01:32:35.309
They are coming

01:32:36.072 --> 01:32:38.063
One - two
One - two

01:32:39.952 --> 01:32:43.183
Attention!
Left turn!

01:32:44.192 --> 01:32:46.251
We are the troops of the New Army

01:32:46.286 --> 01:32:47.398
Who is responsible for the hand-over?

01:32:47.592 --> 01:32:50.425
I am the Constable here,
I sent the telegram

01:32:50.632 --> 01:32:53.351
Sir, another troop is coming

01:32:54.512 --> 01:32:56.025
Line up!

01:32:56.552 --> 01:32:58.508
We are from Luk's camp

01:32:58.712 --> 01:33:00.336
Read this official letter carefully

01:33:00.337 --> 01:33:01.337
Yes.. of course

01:33:07.112 --> 01:33:10.582
Why have two troops come to take over
at the same time?

01:33:11.112 --> 01:33:14.582
They must have received the telegram
at the same time

01:33:15.072 --> 01:33:17.540
But these troops work for different masters

01:33:18.272 --> 01:33:21.503
It's like putting two tigers in the same cage

01:33:21.712 --> 01:33:23.703
Who is going to take control of this area?

01:33:23.912 --> 01:33:25.868
Both are sent by Li Hung Chang

01:33:26.072 --> 01:33:29.064
Let's leave the decision to the chief

01:33:29.272 --> 01:33:33.550
Do you have an official letter
to prove your authority?

01:33:35.072 --> 01:33:37.347
Everybody has gone now

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:40.582
I don't have one

01:33:43.472 --> 01:33:46.908
What shall we do now?

01:33:50.672 --> 01:33:53.550
Are you all right Sir?

01:33:54.872 --> 01:33:57.306
Master Wong, I think you should leave now

01:33:57.512 --> 01:33:59.025
Gun shots?

01:33:59.352 --> 01:34:03.868
This could be a real problem
we'd better wait and see what happens

01:34:05.152 --> 01:34:07.620
This is what happens
when the kingdom loses power

01:34:07.832 --> 01:34:10.710
But in times of stability
there are different problems

01:34:16.872 --> 01:34:18.404
Why are there so many people leaving?

01:34:18.976 --> 01:34:20.358
Let's get aboard

01:34:29.072 --> 01:34:30.729
Don't worry, you'll get tickets soon

01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:31.497
Sit tight

01:34:38.232 --> 01:34:39.407
Others are more in need of these tickets

01:34:39.408 --> 01:34:40.408
My thoughts exactly

01:34:41.552 --> 01:34:42.871
Give them all to me

01:34:46.312 --> 01:34:49.622
Here Sir, take these tickets for your family

01:34:49.832 --> 01:34:50.614
Thank you Sir

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:51.820
Get on board now

01:34:52.192 --> 01:34:55.662
Where is Aunt May?
- Aunt May

01:34:57.032 --> 01:34:58.511
Sister May

01:35:01.512 --> 01:35:02.706
Sister May!

01:35:26.152 --> 01:35:28.029
Sister May...

01:35:34.632 --> 01:35:36.190
Bon voyage!

01:35:36.392 --> 01:35:38.383
You look like an owl again

01:35:38.592 --> 01:35:40.184
Is he crying?

01:35:40.392 --> 01:35:43.065
He can't be,
he must be faking it

01:35:43.272 --> 01:35:45.308
No... It's just...

01:35:45.512 --> 01:35:48.185
She's still got my necklace

01:35:48.592 --> 01:35:51.629
Necklace? What a trauma!

01:35:52.112 --> 01:35:57.266
That's good, one is leaving,
things will be less complicated

01:36:04.632 --> 01:36:06.145
The ship's coming back

01:36:07.952 --> 01:36:09.096
What's going on?

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:10.097
Sister May

01:36:14.272 --> 01:36:17.070
There's a big storm coming so the ship can't sail

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:19.627
Oh no, she's coming back!
