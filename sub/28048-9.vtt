00:13.206 --> 00:13.965
Wow.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.793
That was some tribal.

00:15.827 --> 00:16.793
That was incredible.

00:16.827 --> 00:19.827
Crazy.

00:22.344 --> 00:25.689
Going into tribal, I felt
Like it's going to be me.

00:25.724 --> 00:27.803
And then aurora starts talking
About the dysfunction of the.

00:27.827 --> 00:32.241
Kama tribe, and tribal just goes
Crazy.

00:32.275 --> 00:34.527
But you never know if stuff is
Just theater at tribal council,

00:34.551 --> 00:36.965
So rick and I play the idol on
Me.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.034
I didn't need it.

00:38.068 --> 00:39.965
So that's a wasted idol, but who
Cares?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.206
It was the right move given the
Just complete chaos that we were.

00:44.241 --> 00:49.379
Surrounded by.

00:49.413 --> 00:50.793
She did.

00:50.827 --> 00:54.827
I don't think she realizes
It's her fault julia is gone.

00:54.862 --> 00:58.827
Aurora just kept spewing on and
On, and essentially put.

00:58.862 --> 01:01.827
Everybody's cards on the table,
And it literally was like a.

01:01.862 --> 01:05.034
Perfect storm of, like,
Something's about to give.

01:05.068 --> 01:09.965
In this case it was julia's
Torch gone.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.586
It's done.

01:11.620 --> 01:15.724
I want to build a six-person
Alliance, and what I bring to.

01:15.758 --> 01:18.689
The table is me, kelley, and
Lauren.

01:18.724 --> 01:21.586
We voted always together, every
Single vote.

01:21.620 --> 01:24.344
You and julie always voted
Together.

01:24.379 --> 01:27.862
And the other person I really
Trust is gavin.

01:27.896 --> 01:29.172
That's what I want.

01:29.206 --> 01:35.068
In the old lesu, I was the pilot
On all the votes, but since the.

01:35.103 --> 01:36.862
Merge, I was just a passenger on
The plane.

01:36.896 --> 01:38.448
And was like I thought.

01:38.482 --> 01:41.689
The wardog is being told what to
Do.

01:41.724 --> 01:44.103
But now kama has fractured and
I'm going to take advantage.

01:44.137 --> 01:48.827
I propose that the six of us go
Loyal to the six.

01:48.862 --> 01:50.862
After that, hey, gloves are off.

01:50.896 --> 01:52.355
We're all playing for a million
Dollars, right?

01:52.379 --> 01:53.586
Yeah.

01:53.620 --> 01:55.907
Wouldn't it be nice if we
Could just relax and be strong.

01:55.931 --> 01:59.758
Right.

01:59.793 --> 02:01.482
I told them my idea, and they.

02:01.517 --> 02:02.551
All loved it.

02:02.586 --> 02:06.000
And now they want aurora out
Next.

02:06.034 --> 02:11.793
It's just amazing how these
People just imploded.

02:11.827 --> 02:15.551
Somehow, it all went to hell.

02:15.586 --> 02:20.413
I literally put my foot in my
Mouth, and I ruined possibly my.

02:20.448 --> 02:21.413
Game.

02:21.448 --> 02:25.758
And now, everyone's going off on
Walks but me.

02:32.827 --> 02:35.620
So I'm good being alone.

02:35.655 --> 02:39.862
And so, I'm just trying to see
What tomorrow brings.

02:39.896 --> 02:41.620
I'm going to play.

02:41.655 --> 02:42.862
I'm not giving up.

02:42.896 --> 02:50.896
The problem is I don't know if I
Have a tomorrow.

02:56.655 --> 02:57.241
Ing.

02:57.275 --> 03:00.896
Come on in, guys!

03:00.931 --> 03:04.758
This looks medieval.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.517
All right, shall we
Get to today's immunity.

03:07.551 --> 03:07.827
Challenge?

03:07.862 --> 03:10.379
Yes.

03:10.413 --> 03:12.137
First things first, Gavin.

03:12.172 --> 03:13.793
Gotta take it back.

03:13.827 --> 03:14.206
Thank you.

03:14.241 --> 03:17.620
Thank you.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.103
Once again immunity
Is back up for grabs.

03:20.137 --> 03:24.034
For today's challenge, you'll
Have a bar resting on your.

03:24.068 --> 03:25.172
Shoulders.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.034
It will force you into a very
Uncomfortable position.

03:28.068 --> 03:31.551
If you go too low, your flag
Will pop.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.896
If gutoo high, your urn will
Drop.

03:34.931 --> 03:36.172
Either way, you're out.

03:36.206 --> 03:40.896
Last person left squatting wins
Immunity, safe from the vote.

03:40.931 --> 03:42.872
Losers, tribal council, where
Somebody will be the tenth.

03:42.896 --> 03:44.862
Person voted out of this game.

03:44.896 --> 03:50.310
But if today you feel a certain
Level of safety, this is a good.

03:50.344 --> 03:52.689
Challenge to just sit out.

03:52.724 --> 03:54.137
And instead... >> no!

03:54.172 --> 03:58.965
Feast on a Mountain of pizza!

03:59.000 --> 04:00.344
My god!

04:00.379 --> 04:02.000
My god!

04:02.034 --> 04:05.034
Plus cold beer and Root beer.

04:05.068 --> 04:06.034
Big decision to make.

04:06.068 --> 04:08.137
You're going to make it, and
We'll get started.

04:08.172 --> 04:08.862
Let's do it.

04:08.896 --> 04:16.896
God!

04:22.482 --> 04:27.586
All right, lauren,
Victoria, wentworth, and ron.

04:27.620 --> 04:29.034
Have chosen to sit out and eat.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.137
Everybody take your spots.

04:31.172 --> 04:32.275
Slowly lift that bar.

04:32.310 --> 04:35.827
Make sure that stripe is right
There on your shoulders.

04:35.862 --> 04:43.862
Here we go in five, four, three,
Two, one... Everybody looks.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.344
Good.

04:46.379 --> 04:47.827
This challenge is on.

04:47.862 --> 04:49.000
Big in!

04:49.034 --> 04:53.655
The mountain of pizza is going
To be devoured, as lauren,

04:53.689 --> 04:56.551
Victoria, wentworth, and ron
Decided to give up their shopt.

04:56.586 --> 04:59.034
At immunity and eat pizza.

04:59.068 --> 05:00.275
David already looking over.

05:00.310 --> 05:02.241
I wanted that.

05:02.275 --> 05:04.034
It's not what you Chose.

05:04.068 --> 05:04.827
It's great.

05:04.862 --> 05:06.206
It's a game of Decisions.

05:06.241 --> 05:09.551
It's so good.

05:09.586 --> 05:11.241
You're already Feeling it.

05:11.275 --> 05:16.137
This is an uncomfortable spot,
And the trick is, if you try to.

05:16.172 --> 05:20.655
Get a little relief by going a
Little lower, that flag will.

05:20.689 --> 05:21.862
Pop.

05:21.896 --> 05:25.965
If you go a little higher,
Thaturn will drop, dousing your.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.551
Flame.

05:26.586 --> 05:29.172
Either way, you're out.

05:29.206 --> 05:37.206
You cannot waiver with your
Concentration.

05:43.275 --> 05:45.586
Wardog's out, first Person down.

05:45.620 --> 05:51.206
We are down to five.

05:51.241 --> 05:53.310
Gavin cannot hang in there
Anymore.

05:53.344 --> 05:54.758
Gavin drops.

05:54.793 --> 05:55.758
I'm debate.

05:55.793 --> 05:58.448
Julie just gives out.

05:58.482 --> 06:02.448
Her legs dropped out from under
Her.

06:02.482 --> 06:03.241
Julie is out.

06:03.275 --> 06:05.758
We're down to three.

06:05.793 --> 06:12.275
David, aurora, and devin.

06:12.310 --> 06:15.724
10 minutes into this challenge.

06:15.758 --> 06:23.551
So nice to go to tribal with
Immunity.

06:23.586 --> 06:31.586
David trying to stretch it out
And, man, those bars are moving.

06:32.758 --> 06:33.551
Devens struggling.

06:33.586 --> 06:37.344
You can see it, but he's still
In it.

06:37.379 --> 06:43.931
No movement from aurora.

06:43.965 --> 06:46.068
19 minutes into this challenge.

06:46.103 --> 06:49.068
You all are amazing.

06:49.103 --> 06:50.655
How about you, devens?

06:50.689 --> 06:53.172
Da-da-da!

06:53.206 --> 06:55.586
This sucks.

06:55.620 --> 06:58.379
Aurora and david
Still in it, but not looking as.

06:58.413 --> 07:00.034
Good as devens.

07:00.068 --> 07:04.206
I can't believe he's talking.

07:04.241 --> 07:09.724
Devens drops out, and
We are down to two, another.

07:09.758 --> 07:11.724
Showdown, david versus aurora.

07:11.758 --> 07:12.724
How you feeling?

07:12.758 --> 07:15.448
I'm not dropping, dude.

07:15.482 --> 07:16.689
You knew last tribal council.

07:16.724 --> 07:18.758
I won't survive if I don't have
It.

07:18.793 --> 07:20.896
I'm not going down.

07:20.931 --> 07:22.448
Sorry, bro.

07:22.482 --> 07:25.793
You're at 22 minutes.

07:25.827 --> 07:31.034
Careful, david.

07:31.068 --> 07:33.344
That's getting high, bro.

07:33.379 --> 07:41.379
Aurora hoping david
Makes a mistake and drops.

07:43.448 --> 07:51.448
Aurora hoping david
Makes a mistake and drops.

07:53.241 --> 07:54.310
David drops.

07:54.344 --> 07:58.862
Aurora wins her second
Individual immunity challenge.

07:58.896 --> 07:59.758
Safe tonight at tribal council.

07:59.793 --> 08:01.310
And breaks it, sorry.

08:01.344 --> 08:02.586
Can barely stand.

08:02.620 --> 08:03.655
Good job, guys.

08:03.689 --> 08:08.000
Good job, guys.

08:08.034 --> 08:09.068
Aurora, come on over.

08:09.103 --> 08:14.379
For the second time, immunity is.

08:14.413 --> 08:18.103
Yours, safe tonight at tribal
Council, cannot be voted out of.

08:18.137 --> 08:19.310
This game.

08:19.344 --> 08:21.493
And the way things have been
Going, that has to be a great.

08:21.517 --> 08:21.896
Feeling.

08:21.931 --> 08:23.034
Very good.

08:23.068 --> 08:24.769
As for the rest of
You, after 25 days, tribal.

08:24.793 --> 08:25.931
Council tonight.

08:25.965 --> 08:28.148
Somebody will be the tenth
Person voted out of this game.

08:28.172 --> 08:29.517
Grab your stuff.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.551
Head back to camp.

08:30.586 --> 08:32.551
See you tonight at tribal.

08:32.586 --> 08:33.000
Congrats.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.000
It won't be you.

08:34.034 --> 08:36.275
I am not thrilled that aurora
Won immunity.

08:36.309 --> 08:40.620
I really, really wanted her to
Go home tonight, and now the.

08:40.655 --> 08:42.871
Game has changed so much, I
Don't know what I'm going to do.

08:42.895 --> 08:44.896
At this point.

09:01.862 --> 09:02.379
Great job.

09:02.413 --> 09:03.620
That was not easy.

09:03.655 --> 09:06.689
Aurora wins immunity, which
Is frustrating, because people.

09:06.724 --> 09:10.241
Don't want her in the game
Anymore, but there are other.

09:10.275 --> 09:12.034
Options on the table.

09:12.068 --> 09:15.241
The shix should have a Powwow.

09:15.275 --> 09:16.068
Let's do that.

09:16.103 --> 09:18.931
I think the six are staying
Wrong.

09:18.965 --> 09:20.838
Essentially there are four
People on the outside.

09:20.862 --> 09:24.724
With aurora winning, you have
David, devens, or victoria.

09:24.758 --> 09:27.586
It's like when whichone do you
Take out now?

09:27.620 --> 09:31.275
This is a group of six so I
Think we need to come to a group.

09:31.310 --> 09:32.344
Decision.

09:32.379 --> 09:34.113
What if we snuck attack and
Take out david now.

09:34.137 --> 09:35.931
All of us are voting david.

09:35.965 --> 09:38.482
I wanted david out at the
Last tribal council, because.

09:38.517 --> 09:42.310
He's a returning player and a
Huge strategic threat.

09:42.344 --> 09:43.586
My god.

09:43.620 --> 09:47.620
If we don't get him out now,
He's going going to waltz his.

09:47.655 --> 09:48.896
Way to the end of the game.

09:48.931 --> 09:51.758
There are people out there
Who will get us to try to start.

09:51.793 --> 09:53.734
Turning against each other and
We don't need that.

09:53.758 --> 10:00.310
My plan to take out my
Nemesis in this game, david

10:00.344 --> 10:01.413
Wright, happens tonight.

10:01.448 --> 10:04.758
I never worked with ron or julia
Ever on any vote.

10:04.793 --> 10:10.586
And in a senior where we've had
Five major blindsides, you can.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.137
Never say, "Yeah, I've safe
Tonight."

10:13.172 --> 10:16.482
Well, then there were two.

10:16.517 --> 10:19.896
That lesu three was going to
Be gone right away, and they.

10:19.931 --> 10:20.551
Keep going.

10:20.586 --> 10:21.793
I think we go for wardog.

10:21.827 --> 10:25.275
It's insane that we even have
To have these conversations.

10:25.310 --> 10:26.689
Because they're a power trio.

10:26.724 --> 10:27.620
Just do the math.

10:27.655 --> 10:28.931
Yeah.

10:28.965 --> 10:31.586
Victoria seems genuinely not
On the other side, doesn't she?

10:31.620 --> 10:32.965
Yeah.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.965
I feel like vic is with us.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.068
We need to, like, figure out
Where ron and julie are at.

10:39.103 --> 10:41.827
And get aurora.

10:41.862 --> 10:42.931
Praise jesus.

10:42.965 --> 10:45.044
It looks like devens or
Myself could be going home.

10:45.068 --> 10:48.931
Tonight, but I've played
"Survivor" before, and I know I.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.620
Can turn things around for
Myself.

10:50.655 --> 10:53.275
Maybe I'm just myopic, but I
Want to vote out wardog.

10:53.310 --> 10:56.517
I know that he doesn't want me
In this game, and I have to get.

10:56.551 --> 10:59.827
Him before he gets me.

10:59.862 --> 11:01.034
How do you feel?

11:01.068 --> 11:04.551
I'm trying to think about
What's best-case scenario for.

11:04.586 --> 11:05.206
Me.

11:05.241 --> 11:05.827
There's 10 of us, right?

11:05.862 --> 11:07.000
10.

11:07.034 --> 11:11.620
If you, aurora, julie, ron,
David and I come together.

11:11.655 --> 11:12.482
That's what I was hoping.

11:12.517 --> 11:13.448
We run the game.

11:13.482 --> 11:15.206
That was my ideal scenario.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.586
So I'm glad that you just
Counted it off.

11:18.620 --> 11:20.172
I think that would be Amazing.

11:20.206 --> 11:21.448
Yeah.

11:21.482 --> 11:22.907
At this point, I feel like I'm
On the bottom, so definitely if

11:22.931 --> 11:26.034
I can get out of that role, I'm
Going to.

11:26.068 --> 11:28.344
And this sounds like the plan
That could work.

11:28.379 --> 11:31.137
Have you already made up your
Mind, like, what you're doing.

11:31.172 --> 11:32.068
Tonight?

11:32.103 --> 11:33.034
You don't even have to tell me
What it is.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.068
I haven't.

11:34.103 --> 11:35.320
Obviously, there are two main
Sides still.

11:35.344 --> 11:36.172
Yeah.

11:36.206 --> 11:38.000
Who... okay, who would you
Want out?

11:38.034 --> 11:43.034
I think it's only smart to
Get rid of someone in the power.

11:43.068 --> 11:43.344
Trio.

11:43.379 --> 11:44.068
Yeah.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.000
I would prefer wardog first.

11:46.034 --> 11:49.344
And then I don't care what the
Order is.

11:49.379 --> 11:53.931
My long game does not include
Three lesu members.

11:53.965 --> 11:56.931
It's absolutely true that the
Lesu three are controlling the.

11:56.965 --> 11:57.655
Game.

11:57.689 --> 11:59.172
And they are not talking to me.

11:59.206 --> 12:04.310
So even though I never thought I
Would work with devens and

12:04.344 --> 12:09.034
David, I don't see any other
Option right now.

12:09.068 --> 12:12.896
It's been very rough for you
These last few days, I know, so

12:12.931 --> 12:16.034
I don't to but putt any, like,
Unnecessary pressure on you.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.896
But, like, people are trying to
Preserve the power trio.

12:18.931 --> 12:21.482
They're skating through this
Game to the very end, and.

12:21.517 --> 12:22.793
Everyone is letting them do it.

12:22.827 --> 12:23.724
I don't understand it.

12:23.758 --> 12:26.827
So who's your person to vote
Out?

12:26.862 --> 12:27.655
Wardog.

12:27.689 --> 12:30.068
I don't think we have the
Numbers.

12:30.103 --> 12:31.000
We have the numbers.

12:31.034 --> 12:33.448
But...
if you and ron come on board.

12:33.482 --> 12:34.379
With us.

12:34.413 --> 12:36.620
Not to pull this card...
no, please, do.

12:36.655 --> 12:40.758
But I've played "Survivor"
Before, and there's always that.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.838
One conversation after the game
Soever you think about and I.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.620
Wonder, "Why didn't I do this
Other thing?"

12:45.655 --> 12:46.620
And that's this conversation.

12:46.655 --> 12:47.862
I'm very nervous.

12:47.896 --> 12:50.758
Ron and I formed a six-person
Alliance with the lesu three,

12:50.793 --> 12:55.241
Which I don't know if I'm 100%
Committed to right now.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.068
Wardog's dictating who is going
Home tonight.

12:57.103 --> 12:58.724
That does not sit well with me.

12:58.758 --> 13:06.137
And now I'm wondering if ron and
I are doing the right thing.

13:06.172 --> 13:10.655
Rick and david, they were
Talking about a final six of you.

13:10.689 --> 13:13.827
And me and victoria and aurora.

13:13.862 --> 13:17.000
So I feel like we're in a
Position now kind of in the.

13:17.034 --> 13:21.034
Middle where we could decide
Which final six do we want to go.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.310
With.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.827
Right now, I'm feeling pretty
Good with wardog, lauren, and.

13:24.862 --> 13:25.172
Kelley.

13:25.206 --> 13:26.482
Right.

13:26.517 --> 13:30.034
My only fear is, again, the two
Of us will end up on the bottom.

13:30.068 --> 13:32.172
Two days another I was in
Trouble.

13:32.206 --> 13:35.965
But now I'm in the middle of two
Alliances, and both are trying.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.241
To gain my favor.

13:37.275 --> 13:41.275
On the one hand, I think wardog
And his alliance of six could.

13:41.310 --> 13:42.482
Work.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.458
But problem is I think wardog
Would kin if he gets to the.

13:44.482 --> 13:45.724
Final three.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.068
He's playing a really good game.

13:47.103 --> 13:49.896
But at the same time, I don't
Trust david.

13:49.931 --> 13:51.655
He's sneaky.

13:51.689 --> 13:55.931
And so I don't know if I want to
Get in bed with david or wardog.

13:55.965 --> 13:59.275
Us in the final five with
Three of them is too dangerous.

13:59.310 --> 14:01.344
Like, I obviously want to work
With you.

14:01.379 --> 14:03.517
Like, I'm hoping you want to
Work with me.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.655
Of course.

14:04.689 --> 14:06.827
Jewel semi ride or die, and we
Have the power tonight.

14:06.862 --> 14:09.758
I wish I could have a little bit
More time to let it marinate,

14:09.793 --> 14:11.793
But we're going to have to make
A decision quickly.

14:11.827 --> 14:14.344
We're pretty sure it's going
To be david or I tonight, and.

14:14.379 --> 14:16.448
Then you guys are going to be in
The minority.

14:16.482 --> 14:17.758
You're going to go home, too.

14:17.793 --> 14:20.079
And we're all going to be on the
Jury, and it's just a matter of.

14:20.103 --> 14:20.689
Days.

14:20.724 --> 14:21.689
Let me think about it.

14:21.724 --> 14:23.655
Devens and david's pitch
Makes sense to me.

14:23.689 --> 14:25.586
But ron's unsure.

14:25.620 --> 14:28.551
Together, we can flip the game
On its head, but we have to be.

14:28.586 --> 14:31.551
On the same page.

14:31.586 --> 14:34.724
This could be our million-dollar
Decision, and no matter what.

14:34.758 --> 14:42.758
Happens, I'm ready to expect,
Like, fireworks tonight.

14:44.827 --> 14:52.827
Happens, I'm ready to expect,
Like, fireworks tonight.

14:53.862 --> 15:01.862
I'll now bring in the
Members of our jury.

15:04.068 --> 15:07.448
So, david, after the last
Tribal, which started calm and.

15:07.482 --> 15:11.034
It erupted, you can feel an
Emotional drain on everybody?

15:11.068 --> 15:12.310
Yeah, yeah.

15:12.344 --> 15:15.896
I mean, everyone walked in with
One of two plans, and a third.

15:15.931 --> 15:16.482
Plan emerged.

15:16.517 --> 15:17.793
It was insane.

15:17.827 --> 15:20.068
It's almost like it's the
Beginning of the game, because.

15:20.103 --> 15:22.655
We're all trying to figure out
Who are the people I can trust.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.793
And work with right now going
Forward?

15:24.827 --> 15:27.620
So, devens, when
You're juggling all of these.

15:27.655 --> 15:31.862
Temporary relationships, is
There always one or two that are.

15:31.896 --> 15:32.275
Locked in?

15:32.310 --> 15:34.103
Yeah.

15:34.137 --> 15:36.551
Loyalty and trust is so
Important in this game.

15:36.586 --> 15:39.482
And I didn't come into the game
Playing a loyal game.

15:39.517 --> 15:42.862
I backstabbed chris, and I got
Voted out the next trooibl.

15:42.896 --> 15:46.931
And when I got back, I decided
I'm playing a loyal game.

15:46.965 --> 15:48.862
Tonight, david and I feel like
We're in trouble.

15:48.896 --> 15:53.206
We asked for help, and we hope
Someone shows up.

15:53.241 --> 15:56.827
Julie, last tribal
You were vocal and loud about.

15:56.862 --> 15:59.044
Saying you did not believe in
The people you had believed in.

15:59.068 --> 15:59.896
Yeah.

15:59.931 --> 16:02.068
Where are you sitting Tonight?

16:02.103 --> 16:03.286
How did the game shift for you?

16:03.310 --> 16:06.000
Ron and I came into that
Tribal feeling like we were on.

16:06.034 --> 16:07.482
The bottom of the alliance.

16:07.517 --> 16:11.448
I realized, I'm a passenger on
Someone else's plane, and I'm.

16:11.482 --> 16:15.034
Hitting the "Eject" button right
Now, and I'm so glad that I did.

16:15.068 --> 16:18.172
Because now I feel like maybe
I'm on my own little plane right.

16:18.206 --> 16:20.344
Now, but it's still me flying
The plane.

16:20.379 --> 16:23.241
So, devens, is this
The kind of person you go to,

16:23.275 --> 16:26.655
Someone who has their own
Single-seater?

16:26.689 --> 16:27.896
Absolutely.

16:27.931 --> 16:30.724
Someone like julie who made a
Bold move last time, you go to.

16:30.758 --> 16:34.413
Say & say, "Let's make another
Bold move together."

16:34.448 --> 16:36.103
Wardog, you don't Agree?

16:36.137 --> 16:39.758
What better example than me,
Lauren, and wentworth.

16:39.793 --> 16:41.586
We have voted together eight
Times.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.079
We demonstrated loyalty more
Than anybody else.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.068
Does that sound like a group
That's going to be easy to.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.034
Infiltrate?

16:46.068 --> 16:49.000
No, but are you assuming
Something.

16:49.034 --> 16:50.527
You don't know the dynamic in
The group.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.068
Just because the three of vus
Voted together, because we've.

16:53.103 --> 16:57.241
Had to, didn doesn't mean that t
Going to last forever.

16:57.275 --> 16:58.620
I don't agree at all.

16:58.655 --> 17:01.551
I feel like wardog, kelley, and
Lauren, have been together since.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.517
Day one, have never deviated on
A vote.

17:04.550 --> 17:07.448
Why would they want to sit next
To a kama, when they can sit.

17:07.482 --> 17:11.034
Together in a final three,
Having only turned on the exact.

17:11.068 --> 17:13.896
Same people and argue their
Case?

17:13.931 --> 17:17.896
But nobody for the last several
Votes is willing to take that.

17:17.931 --> 17:18.964
On.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.689
And they're going to lose this
Game because of it.

17:21.723 --> 17:23.172
Ron, where are you in This?

17:23.205 --> 17:27.172
I feel like it's been a very
Hard sell to julie and me.

17:27.205 --> 17:28.458
I don't understand well to that.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.172
I don't respond well to that.

17:29.206 --> 17:30.424
I don't think julie does either.

17:30.448 --> 17:34.724
We have to make decisions over
Who we feel has treated us the.

17:34.758 --> 17:37.068
Best.

17:37.103 --> 17:39.655
Wardog did nato you.

17:39.689 --> 17:41.793
Wardog is very aggressive.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.517
He's very aggressive and vocal.

17:43.551 --> 17:46.241
Hey, my brand, honestly, is
Loyalty.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.137
My god!

17:47.172 --> 17:47.965
Okay!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.965
Stop, stop, stop, stop right
Now!

17:51.000 --> 17:52.241
The same time he said,

17:52.275 --> 17:54.655
"Lauren, I will not vote for
You."

17:54.689 --> 17:55.803
"Lauren, I will never write
Your game down."

17:55.827 --> 17:58.827
We can't play that card.

17:58.862 --> 18:00.413
You're such a squirmer.

18:00.448 --> 18:03.620
You squirm from place to place,
From person, to person, to.

18:03.655 --> 18:04.896
Person.

18:04.931 --> 18:08.034
You're a great talker at tribal
Council, and that's why, in my.

18:08.068 --> 18:10.758
Opinion, you have to go.

18:10.793 --> 18:14.034
David, as the numbers
Dwindle, the burden shifts on.

18:14.068 --> 18:15.862
The other people to own their
Game.

18:15.896 --> 18:17.931
That's exactly right.

18:17.965 --> 18:21.379
Tonight is a choice between an
Easy vote or a hard vote.

18:21.413 --> 18:25.034
The hard vote saves us all, and
Puts us in the better position.

18:25.068 --> 18:28.275
To make it to day 39 and make a
Case for the million dollars.

18:28.310 --> 18:29.551
That's what I want to do.

18:29.586 --> 18:32.758
The easy vote sends one of us
Home, but more importantly, ends.

18:32.793 --> 18:35.620
The games of the other people
I'm working with.

18:35.655 --> 18:37.310
That plan is taking on water.

18:37.344 --> 18:42.344
So all I ask is how deep must
Our ship sink before the rest of.

18:42.379 --> 18:45.000
Us realize we're drowning?

18:45.034 --> 18:48.517
Wow, wentworth,
That's a pretty compelling.

18:48.551 --> 18:49.241
Speech.

18:49.275 --> 18:50.103
I just know what he's doing.

18:50.137 --> 18:52.241
I've been in his position
Before.

18:52.275 --> 18:53.482
I've been on the bottom.

18:53.517 --> 18:59.413
But there was a group born from
The last tribal, and I feel.

18:59.448 --> 19:03.517
Confident that the group that is
Together will stay together.

19:03.551 --> 19:05.482
All right, it is time To vote.

19:05.517 --> 19:10.068
Lauren, you're up.

19:49.793 --> 19:52.068
If anybody has a
Hidden immunity idol and you.

19:52.103 --> 20:00.103
Want to play it, now would be
The time to do so.

20:01.068 --> 20:03.137
Okay.

20:03.172 --> 20:07.482
I'll read the votes.

20:07.517 --> 20:14.137
First vote, david.

20:14.172 --> 20:18.000
Wardog david.

20:18.034 --> 20:21.551
Very formal.

20:21.586 --> 20:22.862
Wardog.

20:22.896 --> 20:28.103
We're tied, two votes david, two
Votes wardog.

20:28.137 --> 20:28.724
David.

20:28.758 --> 20:31.931
That's three votes david.

20:31.965 --> 20:32.517
David.

20:32.551 --> 20:37.827
That's four votes david.

20:37.862 --> 20:38.413
David.

20:38.448 --> 20:40.137
That's five votes david.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.586
Two votes wardog.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.413
Tenth person voted out and the
Seventh member of our jury,

20:46.448 --> 20:47.034
David.

20:47.068 --> 20:47.758
That's six, that's enough.

20:47.793 --> 20:55.793
You need to bring me your torch.

20:58.827 --> 21:01.034
Here we go again, jeff.

21:01.068 --> 21:04.137
David, the tribe has Spoken.

21:04.172 --> 21:06.379
No hard feelings, guys.

21:06.413 --> 21:07.482
You know I had to try.

21:07.517 --> 21:10.000
But I am going to claw my way
Back in.

21:10.034 --> 21:18.034
Iater, buddy.

21:20.103 --> 21:25.964
Decision to make... I'm
Taking the torch.

21:25.965 --> 21:30.103
Decision to make... I'm
Taking the torch.

21:54.103 --> 21:58.965
It's my first morning on the
Exej of combination, and joe.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.724
Walks in with sieve bottles with
Seven clues.

22:01.758 --> 22:04.758
I'm like gam on.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.034
It's a clue to an advantage,
And the rest of these people,

22:15.068 --> 22:18.206
They've been here for days and
Days, and so they're just hungry.

22:18.241 --> 22:20.965
And tired and angry and
Resentful.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.034
Whereas I just got voted out of
The game.

22:23.068 --> 22:26.724
I'm still in game mode.

22:26.758 --> 22:28.000
See ya!

22:28.034 --> 22:33.379
And I take off.

22:33.413 --> 22:36.137
Immediately, I have an idea
In my mind where I think it's.

22:36.172 --> 22:37.413
Going to be.

22:37.448 --> 22:40.655
It says something about "When
You're at your most hollow," and

22:40.689 --> 22:42.241
I think maybe it means hungry.

22:42.275 --> 22:45.793
So then I think maybe it's near
The rice bucket.

22:45.827 --> 22:50.689
It's not there.

22:50.724 --> 22:53.517
David and myself, we run down
This side of the beach, can't.

22:53.551 --> 22:54.827
Find anything.

22:54.862 --> 23:00.241
And then I'm thinking through it
With joe... "Hollow, jagged and."

23:00.275 --> 23:01.413
Smooth."

23:01.448 --> 23:03.793
And we're like what if it's at
The mast, because the sail.

23:03.827 --> 23:06.724
Itself is jagged on the edges,
And it's where you go when.

23:06.758 --> 23:08.310
You're at your most hollow.

23:08.344 --> 23:12.689
We dig around there, but we
Can't find anything.

23:12.724 --> 23:16.379
I read the clue, and
Immediately, I think it's got to.

23:16.413 --> 23:19.551
Be in these rocks around here
Somewhere.

23:19.586 --> 23:24.379
Unyou know, "Hollow, smooth,
Jagged."

23:24.413 --> 23:27.965
It's got to be in the rocks.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.724
Finally, I see it, sitting there
Right before me is the advantage.

23:31.758 --> 23:32.689
Hidden under a rock.

23:32.724 --> 23:34.448
And I'm like, "My god!"

23:34.482 --> 23:37.862
This is the first lucky thing
That's happened to me this.

23:37.896 --> 23:38.896
"Game."

23:38.931 --> 23:40.493
"Your advantage allows to you
Help someone else."

23:40.517 --> 23:43.103
You must send an advantage in
The next immunity challenge to.

23:43.137 --> 23:44.482
"Someone in the game."

23:44.517 --> 23:46.137
Wow.

23:46.172 --> 23:47.379
I have a decision to make.

23:47.413 --> 23:51.482
I have a chance to make somebody
Feel good about me because.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.034
Fimake it back into this game,
That can be the difference.

23:54.068 --> 23:55.413
Between winning and losing.

23:55.448 --> 23:58.724
For so long, I've been trying to
Turn my game around, and to find.

23:58.758 --> 24:01.724
Something that can finally flip
My game around, it means the.

24:01.758 --> 24:02.586
World.

24:02.620 --> 24:07.275
I'm endangered, but I'm not
Extinct.

24:19.793 --> 24:27.793
Come on in, guys!

24:30.517 --> 24:33.379
All right, let's get
To today's immunity challenge.

24:33.413 --> 24:36.206
First things first, aurora, for
The second time, I must take it.

24:36.241 --> 24:39.689
Back.

24:39.724 --> 24:41.344
Thank you.

24:41.379 --> 24:43.724
Thank you.

24:43.758 --> 24:46.896
Once again, immunity is back up
For grabs.

24:46.931 --> 24:49.517
For today's challenge, you're
Going to balance a padole a.

24:49.551 --> 24:50.758
Stand.

24:50.793 --> 24:53.724
On my "Go," you'll roll a ball
Down the paddle, attempting to.

24:53.758 --> 24:55.448
Land it in a dimple.

24:55.482 --> 24:59.034
The first person to get one ball
In each of the five dimples,

24:59.068 --> 25:01.862
Wins immunity, safe from the
Vote.

25:01.896 --> 25:03.872
Loser, tribal council, where
Somebody will be the 11th.

25:03.896 --> 25:06.068
Person voted out of this game.

25:06.103 --> 25:09.413
Jeff.

25:09.448 --> 25:10.620
Devens.

25:10.655 --> 25:13.827
I got a present this morning
From my good buddy david.

25:13.862 --> 25:15.896
Boy!

25:15.931 --> 25:18.310
It says I'm going to have
Some sort of advantage.

25:18.344 --> 25:20.931
Wow!

25:20.965 --> 25:24.000
Devens your advantage
Is instead of five because you.

25:24.034 --> 25:27.310
Only have to land four balls.

25:27.344 --> 25:28.206
Big advantage.

25:28.241 --> 25:29.137
Everybody take your spots.

25:29.172 --> 25:35.724
We'll get started.

25:35.758 --> 25:41.517
All right, everybody pick up yr
Paddles.

25:41.551 --> 25:45.137
Devens, toss me one of your
Balls.

25:45.172 --> 25:46.724
Here we go.

25:46.758 --> 25:50.517
For immunity, survivors ready?

25:50.551 --> 25:55.724
Go.

25:55.758 --> 26:00.310
Like ever "Survivor" challenge,
There is a touch to figuring.

26:00.344 --> 26:01.551
This out.

26:01.586 --> 26:05.034
Your job is to try to finesse
That ball down the paddle and.

26:05.068 --> 26:06.827
Land it in a dimple.

26:06.862 --> 26:08.862
Those are very shallow dimples.

26:08.896 --> 26:11.275
It takes a nice touch.

26:11.310 --> 26:16.068
There are five balls and five
Dimples.

26:16.103 --> 26:20.931
Devdevens has the advantage of o
Needing to land four balls.

26:20.965 --> 26:22.286
Devens is close to landing that
First ball.

26:22.310 --> 26:23.310
You'll know it.

26:23.344 --> 26:30.482
Devens has his first ball,
Working on his second.

26:30.517 --> 26:32.758
Ron doing a nice job.

26:32.793 --> 26:34.379
Ron lands his first ball.

26:34.413 --> 26:37.551
Ron and devens now.

26:37.586 --> 26:41.413
Aurora looking to stick one.

26:41.448 --> 26:44.482
Aurora has her first ball.

26:44.517 --> 26:46.689
Wentworth drops.

26:46.724 --> 26:48.620
Lauren drops.

26:48.655 --> 26:49.241
Julie drops.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.724
She's got to start again.

26:50.758 --> 26:56.344
Devens with his second ball out
There now.

26:56.379 --> 26:57.655
Devens lands his second ball.

26:57.689 --> 27:02.413
It is devens in the lead, and
Devens only has to land four to.

27:02.448 --> 27:04.551
Win.

27:04.586 --> 27:06.586
Aurora very close.

27:06.620 --> 27:08.275
Aurora with two now.

27:08.310 --> 27:12.310
Ron working on his second ball.

27:12.344 --> 27:13.862
Ron has his second ball.

27:13.896 --> 27:20.689
We've got a challenge going
Here.

27:20.724 --> 27:21.862
This is so hard!

27:21.896 --> 27:25.206
Lauren trying to Stick her virs.

27:25.241 --> 27:26.689
Victoria still unsuccessful.

27:26.724 --> 27:28.724
Julie still unsuccessful.

27:28.758 --> 27:30.551
Gavin drops.

27:30.586 --> 27:32.217
Wentworth, no love at all down
On the end.

27:32.241 --> 27:36.379
Can't get anything going.

27:36.413 --> 27:38.275
Devens has his third ball.

27:38.310 --> 27:41.931
Devens now working on his fourth
And final ball.

27:41.965 --> 27:48.206
Huge immunity on day 27.

27:48.241 --> 27:50.586
Devens knocks off his third ball
With his fourth.

27:50.620 --> 27:53.620
Now he's got to reland the
Third, opening the door for.

27:53.655 --> 27:55.896
Others.

27:55.931 --> 27:58.965
Aurora hovering around that
Dimple.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.413
Aurora has her third ball.

28:01.448 --> 28:07.689
It is aurora with three, devens
Working on his third.

28:07.724 --> 28:10.172
Devens sticks his third ball
Again.

28:10.206 --> 28:12.551
Once again, devens on his fourth
Ball.

28:12.586 --> 28:15.034
Ron trying to get back in it.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.241
Ron has his third.

28:17.275 --> 28:21.034
Aurora, devens, and ron each
With three, but devens only.

28:21.068 --> 28:22.206
Needs to land four.

28:22.241 --> 28:26.655
Here comes devens trying to be
Nice and easy for the win.

28:26.689 --> 28:29.137
Devens knocks his ball out yet
Again.

28:29.172 --> 28:31.000
Now he's got two balls on the
Move.

28:31.034 --> 28:33.275
The challenge is wide open
Again.

28:33.310 --> 28:36.172
Ron with his fourth ball.

28:36.206 --> 28:40.034
Aurora now with her fourth ball.

28:40.068 --> 28:43.241
Come on.

28:43.275 --> 28:46.000
Devens has his third
Ball landed again.

28:46.034 --> 28:48.137
He's had several shots at the
Win.

28:48.172 --> 28:50.793
Can't do it, keeps knocking his
Balls off.

28:50.827 --> 28:52.551
That ball is moving fast.

28:52.586 --> 28:53.827
Can he slow it down?

28:53.862 --> 28:54.931
He does.

28:54.965 --> 28:57.896
He's close.

28:57.931 --> 28:59.344
Jeff, jeff, jeff!

28:59.379 --> 29:00.275
I got it.

29:00.310 --> 29:02.482
Devens lands his Fourth ball.

29:02.517 --> 29:05.103
Devens wins individual immunity.

29:05.137 --> 29:06.000
Thank you, david!

29:06.034 --> 29:10.034
Safe tonight at Tribal council.

29:10.068 --> 29:11.034
The advantage pays Off.

29:11.068 --> 29:13.482
Damn!

29:13.517 --> 29:20.482
Whooo!

29:20.517 --> 29:22.344
Devens, come on over.

29:22.379 --> 29:30.379
Devens, safe tonight at tribal.

29:31.068 --> 29:33.448
Council, cannot be voted out of
This game.

29:33.482 --> 29:36.103
As for the rest of you, 27 days
In, somebody going home tonight.

29:36.137 --> 29:39.034
Somebody will be the 11th
Person voted out of this game.

29:39.068 --> 29:40.103
Grab your stuff.

29:40.137 --> 29:41.206
Head back to camp.

29:41.241 --> 29:42.172
See you tonight at tribal.

29:42.206 --> 29:42.862
Congrats.

29:42.896 --> 29:44.620
Thank you.

29:44.655 --> 29:46.769
I've always thought that
Aurora's dangerous because I.

29:46.793 --> 29:49.103
Think not only is she a
Challenge beast, but she's.

29:49.137 --> 29:51.689
Somebody that people might want
To bring to the end.

29:51.724 --> 29:55.206
Last time she won immunity, and
We couldn't vote her out.

29:55.241 --> 29:58.413
But I am praying tonight's our
Chance.

30:15.586 --> 30:17.517
I don't understand how you guys
Were doing it.

30:17.551 --> 30:18.976
I just win every challenge
That has those little white.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.137
Balls.

30:20.172 --> 30:23.793
Last tribal council I lose my
Closest ally in the game.

30:23.827 --> 30:26.034
People were getting blindsided
Left and right.

30:26.068 --> 30:29.413
Tribal has been live so,
Everybody really wants this.

30:29.448 --> 30:30.241
Baby, including me.

30:30.275 --> 30:33.482
And I'm glad I have it.

30:33.517 --> 30:34.758
The.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.148
The fact that he's getting an
Advantage from the other side.

30:36.172 --> 30:36.896
I know.

30:36.931 --> 30:37.551
Dangerous.

30:37.586 --> 30:41.206
It's a mute point.

30:41.241 --> 30:43.103
Aurora, it's an easy vote.

30:43.137 --> 30:44.803
She's too good at these
Immunity challenges.

30:44.827 --> 30:47.758
Yeah, she's too good, too Good.

30:47.793 --> 30:49.389
I think people when they're in a
Position of power they want an.

30:49.413 --> 30:52.241
Easy vote, and this one looks
Like the most easiest vote.

30:52.275 --> 30:55.724
The group of six the target is
On aurora, but she really has no.

30:55.758 --> 30:56.931
Ties in this game.

30:56.965 --> 31:00.068
There are bigger threats out
There, so I think it's time to.

31:00.103 --> 31:03.034
Make a move on the last
Returning player and that's.

31:03.068 --> 31:09.103
Kellie wentworth.

31:09.137 --> 31:11.275
What else can she do?

31:11.310 --> 31:12.275
She's dead man walking.

31:12.310 --> 31:13.448
She knows it.

31:13.482 --> 31:15.631
You, me, and lauren at this
Point are calling the shots.

31:15.655 --> 31:20.103
To make a move like this
Against somebody who knows he.

31:20.137 --> 31:22.586
Well, somebody who has
Strategized for me for 27 days.

31:22.620 --> 31:25.137
In had this game, you've got to
Be stell.

31:25.172 --> 31:28.310
So this morning, I had had
30-second conversations with

31:28.344 --> 31:31.689
Aurora, devens, and victoria.

31:31.724 --> 31:32.517
We're doing it tonight.

31:32.551 --> 31:33.103
Doing what?

31:33.137 --> 31:33.689
Wentworth.

31:33.724 --> 31:34.931
Okay.

31:34.965 --> 31:38.275
I can't really be caught
Talking to because they all want.

31:38.310 --> 31:40.965
You out but we're taking out
Kelley tonight.

31:41.000 --> 31:41.793
Okay.

31:41.827 --> 31:43.862
Do you think you have the
Numbers?

31:43.896 --> 31:44.586
Yes.

31:44.620 --> 31:45.862
Ron, that's all we need.

31:45.896 --> 31:48.000
Okay, yeah, dude, music to my
Ears.

31:48.034 --> 31:51.655
Logically I knew they would
Work with me.

31:51.689 --> 31:57.206
My plan still requires one major
Convincing.

31:57.241 --> 31:58.827
Small concern, right?

31:58.862 --> 31:59.896
Okay.

31:59.931 --> 32:02.586
We can't let a returner get
To the final three.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.103
Right.

32:04.137 --> 32:05.172
Too good of a story.

32:05.206 --> 32:08.137
Toofgd a story.

32:08.172 --> 32:11.379
Coach went to second.

32:11.413 --> 32:12.724
Rob won his season.

32:12.758 --> 32:16.000
We're all superfans.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.379
We can't let that happen.

32:18.413 --> 32:19.793
Why can't we take her out
Tonight?

32:19.827 --> 32:21.655
I can't believe when I'm
Hearing right now.

32:21.689 --> 32:24.000
Wardog is like, "You know, I
Think it's kelley."

32:24.034 --> 32:25.172
We've got to get her today.

32:25.206 --> 32:29.482
We've got to get her out!"
He is so unpredictable, and that.

32:29.517 --> 32:30.724
Scares me.

32:30.758 --> 32:33.310
Kelley is definitely the biggest
Threat, but everyone left in.

32:33.344 --> 32:36.724
This game, but if anyone goes
Home tonight but aurora, julie's.

32:36.758 --> 32:37.793
Going to be furious.

32:37.827 --> 32:43.551
And so I've got to be careful
About that decision.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.103
It's too easy, isn't it?

32:45.137 --> 32:48.275
Sometimes when it's too easy
It makes me nervous that there's.

32:48.310 --> 32:50.034
Some other plan in play.

32:50.068 --> 32:51.689
Agreed.

32:51.724 --> 32:52.034
Agreed.

32:52.068 --> 32:53.137
But...

32:53.172 --> 32:54.527
it doesn't make sense to jump
Ship at this point.

32:54.551 --> 32:57.034
I've always had to be the
Scrappy underdog, and so now.

32:57.068 --> 33:01.551
That I'm in a majority alliance,
It is nice because there is just.

33:01.586 --> 33:03.896
This kind of calm.

33:03.931 --> 33:07.137
But, all it takes is one person
To be like, "It's time to get."

33:07.172 --> 33:09.758
"Out wentworth," and they could
Try and make a move against me.

33:09.793 --> 33:13.793
So I'm just so glad I have the
Safety of a hid hadden immunity.

33:13.827 --> 33:18.793
Idol right now.

33:18.827 --> 33:20.965
Do you really think he's
Doing it?

33:21.000 --> 33:21.724
I do.

33:21.758 --> 33:23.827
I think he's worried.

33:23.862 --> 33:26.379
That he'd lose numbers if he
Waits too long.

33:26.413 --> 33:32.034
Tonight, either I'm going to
Be blindsided because yet again,

33:32.068 --> 33:36.931
I've just been told a pointless
Lie, or kelley's going home, but

33:36.965 --> 33:44.965
I was given an extra vote from
Someone on the edge of.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.931
Extinction, and could I maybe
Use that to try to gather favor?

33:48.965 --> 33:54.448
Absolutely.

33:54.482 --> 33:58.379
And I really want to vote
With you.

33:58.413 --> 34:02.206
If I give you my advantage, and
I get voted out, it's yours.

34:02.241 --> 34:05.172
I'd like if I come back in, that
You give it back, and it's ours.

34:05.206 --> 34:06.103
For us.

34:06.137 --> 34:08.482
I will hold it and hand it
Back to you.

34:08.516 --> 34:09.344
Okay.

34:09.379 --> 34:11.034
And if not, good luck in the
Game, bro.

34:11.068 --> 34:13.068
Okay.

34:13.103 --> 34:16.103
Right before we leave for
Tribal, aurora gives me her.

34:16.137 --> 34:19.206
Extra vote, and instantly my
Mind goes to a dark place.

34:19.241 --> 34:22.413
I could vote her out and if I
Write down her name, she's gone,

34:22.447 --> 34:24.034
And I keep this vote for myself.

34:24.068 --> 34:25.217
So tonight I have two options.

34:25.241 --> 34:29.310
I can work with my original
Alliance to vote out aurora...

34:29.344 --> 34:30.413
she's got to go.

34:30.447 --> 34:32.413
Do you understand what I'm
Saying?

34:32.447 --> 34:33.620
Yup.

34:33.655 --> 34:36.585
Or I can go and work with
Wardog, and the three who are on.

34:36.620 --> 34:40.137
The outs, to vote out kelley
Wentworth.

34:40.172 --> 34:42.148
I love being in the middle and
Being the decision maker.

34:42.172 --> 34:44.000
But I've got quite a dilemma.

34:44.034 --> 34:46.034
I want to make sure I make the
Right call.

34:46.068 --> 34:48.793
Because it could be the
Difference between losing or.

34:48.827 --> 34:51.827
Winning a million dollars.

35:07.620 --> 35:14.965
The members of our jury.

35:17.724 --> 35:20.586
So, devens, when you
Look at whose happened so far in.

35:20.620 --> 35:23.586
The game, very few people
Sitting over there on the jury.

35:23.620 --> 35:27.310
Would say, "Yeah, I knew it was
Coming."

35:27.344 --> 35:30.448
So how do you know it's you that
Is about to be blindsided?

35:30.482 --> 35:33.448
When it's you that's being
Tricked, I think everything.

35:33.482 --> 35:35.068
Comes a little too easy.

35:35.103 --> 35:37.355
When everything falls into place
So perfectly for you, I think.

35:37.379 --> 35:40.206
With this group, this season,
You have to step back and go,

35:40.241 --> 35:43.517
- "What am I missing here?"
- Victoria, how do you.

35:43.551 --> 35:46.275
Know if you were in on the
Conversations?

35:46.310 --> 35:49.379
I mean, I've been in on very
Little conversations independent.

35:49.413 --> 35:50.655
Past few days.

35:50.689 --> 35:54.482
There was one thing that I've
Been told, but since devens won.

35:54.517 --> 35:59.586
Immunity today, me and aurora
Seem to be left as options.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.689
Aurora, this is not
The first time your name has.

36:01.724 --> 36:02.896
Come up at tribal.

36:02.931 --> 36:05.827
It's the first time it's come
Up when I didn't have the.

36:05.862 --> 36:06.655
Necklace.

36:06.689 --> 36:07.872
But there's still options out
There.

36:07.896 --> 36:10.551
I have to just take all the
Information in front of me and.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.172
Try and figure out the truth.

36:12.206 --> 36:15.931
Ron, there's an idea
When had you play a game like.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.182
"Survivor" that you have to make
Your very best move on the.

36:18.206 --> 36:21.931
Assumption that all the other
Players are also making their.

36:21.965 --> 36:23.172
Very best move.

36:23.206 --> 36:26.862
Yeah, it makes sense, but
Once a group of people taste of.

36:26.896 --> 36:28.907
Blood of a blindside, they
Become addicted and they want.

36:28.931 --> 36:33.689
More of it, so that's why the
Past few days we put a lot of.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.275
Effort into slid foog a group of
People who won't have to worry.

36:36.310 --> 36:37.793
About blindsides.

36:37.827 --> 36:40.241
Wentworth, does that
Ring true, there is something.

36:40.275 --> 36:43.034
About the blindside that could
Potentially cloud the game.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.448
Because you just want another
Blindside!

36:45.482 --> 36:46.931
Yeah.

36:46.965 --> 36:49.458
When you're part of a blindside,
You feel like you were part of.

36:49.482 --> 36:51.758
Something the other people
Weren't a part of.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.620
So I think there are times when
Blindsides are necessary, but a.

36:54.655 --> 36:58.379
Blindside every time isn't
Always the right decision.

36:58.413 --> 36:59.758
Wardog, do you agree With that?

36:59.793 --> 37:01.551
I totally agree with that.

37:01.586 --> 37:03.413
Last tribal was not a blindside.

37:03.448 --> 37:05.803
David fought for his life, and
That was the right decision, and.

37:05.827 --> 37:08.689
Hopefully more right decisions
Are made over these next few.

37:08.724 --> 37:09.931
Tribals as well.

37:09.965 --> 37:12.206
So, victoria, 27 days
In, if you're not feeling the.

37:12.241 --> 37:13.551
Love at camp, what do you do?

37:13.586 --> 37:17.068
All the time things flip on
Their head.

37:17.103 --> 37:20.034
The smaller the numbers get, the
Less strong some alliances that.

37:20.068 --> 37:21.724
Have been around for a while
Will become.

37:21.758 --> 37:24.275
Because you can't just go with
Who you're comfortable with.

37:24.310 --> 37:27.241
You really have to start
Thinking who do I want to sit.

37:27.275 --> 37:28.689
With at the end of this game?

37:28.724 --> 37:32.034
In that sense, there are a lot
More scary people left in this.

37:32.068 --> 37:33.689
Game than me.

37:33.724 --> 37:37.000
So, wentworth, when
Is the right time to start.

37:37.034 --> 37:39.044
Thinking about who do you want
To sit next to at the end?

37:39.068 --> 37:40.724
That's a tricky question.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.907
I think people are thinking
Towards the end game but you.

37:42.931 --> 37:45.689
Also have to think about who you
Can trust because if you don't.

37:45.724 --> 37:48.344
Trust people getting there, you
May not get there at all.

37:48.379 --> 37:52.241
Devens, there has
Been one advantage played in the.

37:52.275 --> 37:56.896
Game by you, and there has been
One idol, also played by you.

37:56.931 --> 37:57.827
Yeah.

37:57.862 --> 37:59.965
27 days in, that's Very unusual.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.862
Well, I would first like to
Thank the beautiful angel that.

38:03.896 --> 38:07.827
Is david wright who gave me that
Advantage today.

38:07.862 --> 38:11.862
But we scoured every beach we've
Been to, and no one claims to.

38:11.896 --> 38:15.862
Have found anything, so I think
The group consensus is that the.

38:15.896 --> 38:18.862
"Edge of extinction" is where
Advantages lie.

38:18.896 --> 38:22.448
Ron, anybody that
Feels on the outs is a vote to.

38:22.482 --> 38:23.689
Be scooped up.

38:23.724 --> 38:28.034
Do you constantly sit back and
Assess, "Who can I get to."

38:28.068 --> 38:30.103
Join the flock?"
I think sometimes when you.

38:30.137 --> 38:32.551
Have an alliance you feel
Comfortable with, you don't want.

38:32.586 --> 38:35.965
To do that because if others see
You doing that, then you become.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.241
Suspect.

38:37.275 --> 38:38.527
And so sometimes you have to put
The pedal down, and sometimes.

38:38.551 --> 38:41.517
You need to relax a bit because
If you're too aggressive, you.

38:41.551 --> 38:43.275
Become a threat.

38:43.310 --> 38:46.965
Julie, in terms of a
Game, pedal down or backing off?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.586
For me, I'm back off.

38:48.620 --> 38:53.482
I feel like tonight would be a
Safe and easy decision to try.

38:53.517 --> 38:57.551
And shake things up again would
Be like rearranging the.

38:57.586 --> 38:58.724
Paintings on the "Titanic."

38:58.758 --> 39:00.344
Like, there's no point.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.310
All right, it is time To vote.

39:03.344 --> 39:06.344
Wentworth, you're up.

39:39.517 --> 39:46.068
I'll go tally the Votes.

39:46.103 --> 39:49.965
I'm very cold.

39:53.448 --> 39:56.689
If anybody has a
Hidden immunity idol and you.

39:56.724 --> 40:04.724
Want to play it, now would be
The time to do so.

40:09.896 --> 40:10.655
Okay.

40:10.689 --> 40:13.344
I'll read the votes.

40:16.517 --> 40:19.758
First vote, aurora.

40:19.793 --> 40:27.793
Wentworth.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.413
Aurora.

40:29.448 --> 40:30.000
Aurora.

40:30.034 --> 40:34.793
Three votes aurora.

40:34.827 --> 40:35.413
Aurora.

40:35.448 --> 40:36.724
That's four votes aurora.

40:36.758 --> 40:41.103
One vote wentworth.

40:41.137 --> 40:41.689
Wentworth.

40:41.724 --> 40:44.724
Two votes wentworth.

40:44.758 --> 40:45.517
Wentworth.

40:45.551 --> 40:53.551
That's three votes wentworth.

40:54.068 --> 40:55.137
Wentworth.

40:55.172 --> 40:58.000
We're tied, four votes
Wentworth, four votes, aurora.

40:58.034 --> 41:04.172
One vote left.

41:04.206 --> 41:06.965
11th person voted out and
The eighth member of our jury,

41:07.000 --> 41:07.689
Wentworth.

41:07.724 --> 41:08.172
You need to bring me your torch.

41:08.206 --> 41:13.827
Wow, guys.

41:13.862 --> 41:21.862
A lot of lying going on.

41:24.482 --> 41:28.448
Wentworth, the tribe Has spoken.

41:28.482 --> 41:29.689
Time for you to go.

41:29.724 --> 41:30.482
Good luck.

41:30.517 --> 41:33.517
See you soon.

jeff Stay tuned for scenes.

42:06.827 --> 42:07.827
From our next episode.

42:13.068 --> 42:18.034
Next time on survivor, revenge
Fueled rage.

42:18.068 --> 42:21.000
Wardog talked to me like a dog,
And I want his head on a silver.

42:21.034 --> 42:24.206
Platter, could lead to a
Powerful alliance.

42:24.241 --> 42:26.896
Ron, wardog and I kind of need
Each other.

42:26.931 --> 42:30.724
Or another blindside.

42:30.758 --> 42:32.862
If I dont work with you now,
Maybe next time

42:32.896 --> 42:36.137
I'm impressed with how the games
Moves and the other players.

42:36.172 --> 42:40.206
I'm pissed to myself because I
Had an idol in my pocket.

42:40.241 --> 42:42.275
I can't believe I'm that Person.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.206
I'm that dumb "Survivor" player.

42:44.241 --> 42:46.034
Congratulations welcome to the
Losers lounge.

42:46.068 --> 42:50.896
My god, I had an idol. I'm so
Pissed. And lauren has the monu.

42:50.931 --> 42:53.965
One. >> She does? >> Yeah
