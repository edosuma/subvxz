(tense music)

01:35.805 --> 01:38.222
(soft music)

01:47.650 --> 01:48.899
- Hi, handsome.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.109
- Good morning, gorgeous.

01:56.117 --> 01:56.990
Lauren: Morning.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.242
- There they are.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.243
- Morning, Dad.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.494
- Hi.

02:00.538 --> 02:01.453
- Morning.
- Good morning, Dad.

02:01.497 --> 02:01.954
- Morning, sweetie.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.455
- Thank you.

02:03.499 --> 02:03.997
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning, son.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.293
- Bye, guys, love ya.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.919
- Bye.
- Bye, have a good day.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.464
- Oh, don't forget to come
home right after school today.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.757
- (scoffs) We know, you told us,

02:13.801 --> 02:15.926
like, a million
times. (chuckles)

02:15.970 --> 02:16.718
- Did I?

02:16.762 --> 02:18.428
- Yeah.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.056
- Okay, come home
right after school.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.267
- Later.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.187
- You nervous?

02:28.774 --> 02:30.399
- I just can't believe
this is actually happening.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.152
It's all so sudden.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.696
- I know, but it was
the right thing to do.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.865
- I haven't seen
Samantha in years.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.409
Jeez, it's been decades.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.119
She was only a year
old when I left.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.288
- Hey, none of
this is your fault.

02:46.750 --> 02:51.086
- I know, I just feel like
I could've tried harder.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.463
- Samantha's mother cut
you out of her life.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.049
You did the best you could
under the circumstances,

02:56.093 --> 02:58.260
and now you're making it right.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.094
- Yeah.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.014
- You still nervous?

03:02.057 --> 03:03.348
- Of course.

03:03.392 --> 03:04.850
What if she doesn't like me?

03:04.894 --> 03:06.393
- Who wouldn't love you?

03:06.437 --> 03:08.979
- Cats, cats do not love me.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.480
Maybe small birds,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.024
and that guy that works
at the liquor store, he--

03:12.067 --> 03:13.358
- Greg, you're gonna be fine.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.570
Look, this is your
second chance,

03:16.614 --> 03:18.822
you deserve to know Samantha.

03:20.326 --> 03:21.450
You can do this.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.285
We can totally do this.

03:25.748 --> 03:27.581
- How'd I get so lucky?

03:27.625 --> 03:28.457
- Oh.

03:31.462 --> 03:34.171
- Oh, hey, what do you think
Samantha might want for dinner?

03:34.215 --> 03:37.216
- Well, she told me she's
a vegetarian, so, lettuce?

03:38.677 --> 03:41.094
- I can work with that.
(soft music)

03:41.138 --> 03:42.429
- You have any clients today?

03:42.473 --> 03:46.600
- No, I took the whole
day off to prepare.

03:46.644 --> 03:49.478
- Well, I only have
two consults, so...

03:49.521 --> 03:50.562
- No surgeries? I
don't believe it.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.814
- Believe it, baby.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.942
I might actually be
home early for once.

03:54.985 --> 03:55.901
- That'll be the day.

03:55.945 --> 03:56.777
- Love you.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.070
- Love you too.

04:00.532 --> 04:04.284
(doorbell rings)

04:04.328 --> 04:07.287
- Samantha, it's
so good to see you.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.250
- Hey, Dad. (chuckles)

04:11.293 --> 04:13.293
- Uh, hi, I'm Katie.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.296
Uh, these are your
half-siblings,

04:16.339 --> 04:18.048
this is Lauren and Tommy.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.548
- Hey.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.260
- It's so nice to
meet you, Samantha.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.388
Katie: Oh, come in,
come in, please.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.847
- Uh, I--

04:25.891 --> 04:26.473
Katie: Tommy, will you
help her with her bags?

04:26.517 --> 04:27.557
- Yeah, of course.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.477
Katie: Ah, so are you hungry?

04:30.521 --> 04:31.937
Greg said you're a vegetarian?

04:31.981 --> 04:33.647
- Yeah, I'm definitely hungry.

04:33.691 --> 04:36.024
Katie: All right,
how was your trip?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.776
- Uh, it was okay,
it was uneventful.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.613
Greg: Oh.
(Katie chuckles)

04:41.657 --> 04:43.448
- So how did you guys meet?

04:43.492 --> 04:46.535
- Um...
- Uh, well,

04:46.578 --> 04:48.120
I was working--
- That's going way back.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.081
- Yeah, I was working at this
coffee shop, near campus,

04:51.125 --> 04:54.418
and Greg would come in
every Wednesday morning,

04:54.461 --> 04:55.836
that was my shift.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.546
One day, he finally
asked me out,

04:57.589 --> 04:59.673
and he was so excited

04:59.717 --> 05:00.841
that I had said yes
(Greg chuckles)

05:00.884 --> 05:03.093
on the first ask,

05:03.137 --> 05:05.512
that he's walking
away from me all cool

05:05.556 --> 05:07.222
and maintaining eye contact,

05:07.266 --> 05:08.515
and he fell and tripped

05:08.559 --> 05:10.600
and got stuck in the bush
(Greg chuckles)

05:10.644 --> 05:11.768
and I had to help him out.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.270
I've never laughed
so hard in my life,

05:13.314 --> 05:15.897
his arms and legs flailing
all over the place,

05:15.941 --> 05:17.232
it was so good.
- Okay,

05:17.276 --> 05:18.358
they weren't flailing,
(Samantha laughs)

05:18.402 --> 05:19.901
that's a bit of an exaggeration.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.154
- Well, how long have
you guys been married?

05:23.532 --> 05:26.325
- Uh, it'll be 19
years next month.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.452
- Wow, 19 years.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.911
Congratulations.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.872
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.291
- I guess it didn't take you
long to start a new family

05:34.335 --> 05:36.209
after Mom kicked you out?

05:36.253 --> 05:39.087
(tense music)

05:39.131 --> 05:42.674
- Listen, Sam, I wanted
to be a part of your life,

05:42.718 --> 05:46.303
I always wanted that, but
your Mother, she just refused.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.847
- Don't worry, Dad,
I get how she was.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.684
Um, I'm kinda tired.

05:54.563 --> 05:55.520
- You must be.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.814
Uh, Lauren, Tommy,

05:57.858 --> 05:59.608
do you guys wanna
help Sam get settled

05:59.651 --> 06:01.151
and show her to her room?

06:01.195 --> 06:03.612
- Uh, we can give you a
quick tour if you'd like,

06:03.655 --> 06:05.447
show you around in
case you need anything.

06:05.491 --> 06:06.823
- Okay, sure.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.033
- Right this way.

06:08.077 --> 06:10.035
(Samantha and Lauren chuckle)

06:10.079 --> 06:11.870
- Oh, I'll help you with these.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.796
- And this is your room.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.925
Bathroom's right
there, I'm next door,

06:24.968 --> 06:27.469
and Tommy's just
upstairs if you need us.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.763
- Cool, thanks so much for
helping me with my bags,

06:29.807 --> 06:31.681
and it's so nice
to meet you guys.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.475
- You too.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.811
I'm really sorry about your mom,

06:35.854 --> 06:38.313
but I'm really glad
that you're here.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.358
- Thanks.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.611
- So,

06:44.655 --> 06:48.782
uh, do you go by
Sam or Samantha?

06:48.826 --> 06:50.534
- Yeah, Sam's fine. (chuckles)

06:50.577 --> 06:51.368
- Cool.

06:52.663 --> 06:53.787
Well, goodnight, Sam.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.372
- Goodnight.
- Night, sweet dreams.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.164
- You too.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.044
(knock at door)

07:01.088 --> 07:01.795
- Oh, come in.

07:07.511 --> 07:08.635
- You need anything?

07:08.679 --> 07:10.095
- Uh, no, I'm good,

07:10.139 --> 07:12.556
I think I'm just gonna
unpack a bit before bed.

07:15.727 --> 07:16.518
- Um...

07:18.230 --> 07:20.856
I'm, I'm really happy
that this all worked out.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.775
- Yeah, me too.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.947
- Oh, also, only if
you're feeling up to it,

07:28.991 --> 07:32.576
tomorrow night, my
boss is throwing this
little get-together

07:32.619 --> 07:34.744
for my work anniversary.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.998
He lives right next door,
it's just nothing fancy,

07:38.041 --> 07:40.625
some family friends
and colleagues.

07:42.588 --> 07:45.839
- Yeah, um, it sounds great.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.175
- Great.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.342
Great, all right, well,

07:50.512 --> 07:51.928
goodnight, Samantha.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.390
- Hey, Dad, um, (sighs)

07:57.269 --> 07:59.019
thanks so much for having me,

08:00.689 --> 08:01.605
I really missed you.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.656
- Sweet dreams.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.408
Samantha: Night.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.667
(tense music)

08:27.174 --> 08:29.674
- You know, I think
that went really well.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.259
- Yeah.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.302
She seems sweet.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.514
God, what happened to
her mom was so tragic.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.976
You know, I could try to talk
to her, get her to open up.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.979
- Oh, don't do that.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.065
Not yet, I really want her
to feel comfortable here.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.858
- Yeah, I want that too,

08:46.902 --> 08:49.069
I just know that healing
requires letting it out,

08:50.489 --> 08:52.280
and she also seemed
pretty uncomfortable

08:52.324 --> 08:55.075
when we were talking
about our relationship.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.117
- She didn't mean it.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.788
I mean, it's a lot for
anybody to take in.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.415
- You're right,
no, you're right,

09:02.459 --> 09:05.252
I'm sure it's just my therapist
brain working overtime.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.632
- Let's not psychoanalyze her
before getting to know her,

09:10.676 --> 09:11.841
deal?

09:11.885 --> 09:12.676
- Deal.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.098
How are you feeling
with all of this?

09:19.351 --> 09:21.977
- I see, psychoanalyzing
me now, Doctor.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.770
- Shut up.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.438
- Uh, I'm excited,

09:26.525 --> 09:27.315
I'm scared,

09:28.485 --> 09:30.986
and I don't know what I'm doing.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.447
- You don't have to, we're
gonna do it together.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.328
- Get in here.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.874
(upbeat music))

09:48.422 --> 09:51.423
(indistinct chatter)

09:52.926 --> 09:56.595
- Thank you for coming
today, it's an honor.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.389
Excuse me for a moment.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.685
- That's, that does help.

10:03.729 --> 10:04.477
It does help.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.770
Hi, oh, hello.

10:06.648 --> 10:07.856
- Plastic surgery?

10:07.899 --> 10:09.816
- Not easy, I know.
- Greg, hi.

10:09.860 --> 10:10.775
- Hi.

10:10.819 --> 10:11.985
- How are you doing?

10:12.029 --> 10:14.029
- Good, tough to
follow in my footsteps,

10:14.072 --> 10:15.488
(drowned out).

10:15.532 --> 10:17.741
Tommy: Dad, I'd love to
be a plastic surgeon.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.869
(clinks glass)

10:20.912 --> 10:23.747
- I'd, uh, like to
propose a toast.

10:26.001 --> 10:30.462
Dr. Greg Carlisle is the
epitome of everything

10:30.505 --> 10:33.548
that Saint Joseph's
Hospital strives to be.

10:35.844 --> 10:36.843
Kind,

10:37.971 --> 10:39.179
family-oriented,

10:40.641 --> 10:43.558
and committed to
providing our community

10:43.602 --> 10:46.519
with the best possible care.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.898
He is the definition
of grounded,

10:51.401 --> 10:55.320
has raised two beautiful
children, Tommy and Lauren,

10:57.115 --> 11:00.742
and, uh, married a woman
who I must say is, um,

11:02.079 --> 11:03.828
way out of his
league. (laughter)

11:03.872 --> 11:04.871
Am I right?

11:04.915 --> 11:05.705
Greg: Yes, sure.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.040
- Ladies and gentlemen,

11:07.084 --> 11:08.875
Greg Carlisle and
his beautiful family.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.128
(glasses clink)

11:12.172 --> 11:13.755
Yeah, come on, don't be shy.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.591
- Well, thank you, Richard.

11:16.635 --> 11:17.384
- You're welcome.

11:19.221 --> 11:22.639
- It's an honor to be a part
of the Saint Joseph's team,

11:22.683 --> 11:27.435
and I'm very grateful for
the incredible support staff,

11:29.606 --> 11:31.022
and I'm so happy
that so many of you

11:31.066 --> 11:32.482
were able to be here tonight.

11:33.944 --> 11:37.028
My work is as important to me

11:37.072 --> 11:39.823
as being a father and a husband,

11:41.660 --> 11:44.202
and as my beautiful wife says,

11:44.246 --> 11:46.705
being Superman only takes
the will to try, so...

11:49.209 --> 11:52.585
So thank you for allowing
me the opportunity

11:52.629 --> 11:54.879
to make a difference in the
lives of this community.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.467
Man: Woo! Here-here!

11:59.511 --> 12:01.845
(upbeat music)

12:08.895 --> 12:11.896
(indistinct chatter)

12:13.108 --> 12:13.857
- Samantha?

12:16.194 --> 12:17.026
Samantha?

12:18.613 --> 12:19.404
Samantha?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.532
Samantha, wait.

12:22.576 --> 12:23.575
He didn't mean it.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.826
- He didn't even mention me.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.536
- He didn't know.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.955
Now, look, this is a new
situation for all of us, okay?

12:28.999 --> 12:30.665
We just need a
chance to acclimate.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.250
- It is all about your
perfect-family image,

12:32.294 --> 12:34.252
I just don't fit in.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.838
- Of course you do,
this is your family now.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.840
- No, it's not.

12:38.884 --> 12:39.591
- Samantha--

12:39.634 --> 12:40.425
- Don't.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.480
(tense music)

12:55.484 --> 12:57.942
(door opens)

13:00.739 --> 13:02.030
- Hey.

13:02.073 --> 13:02.864
- Hey.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.076
So, does everyone hate me now?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.078
- What?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.538
No, no one hates you.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.000
- Yeah, right. (scoffs)

13:16.463 --> 13:17.212
- You know, I was
just thinking about

13:17.255 --> 13:19.464
my favorite memory of you.

13:19.508 --> 13:22.050
I came to visit, and we all
went out for Italian food,

13:22.093 --> 13:24.928
and I bought you this
big, pink, stuffed bear.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.387
It was bigger than you.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.014
- (chuckles) I
remember that bear.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.766
- Yeah, and you were
wearing these overalls

13:29.810 --> 13:31.392
with these little
balloons on the front.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.478
We tried to keep them clean,

13:33.522 --> 13:36.022
but you kept getting
spaghetti all over them.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.816
And I sat next to you,

13:37.859 --> 13:40.276
and you fed me pasta with
your grubby little hands.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.822
- You mean I wasn't even
using a napkin and a fork yet?

13:43.865 --> 13:46.199
- Nope, you took after your
dad right from the start.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.953
- I wish it had just
been you and me.

13:51.748 --> 13:52.831
- Well, now it can be.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.583
Just give it a
little time, okay?

13:57.087 --> 13:58.461
Katie's great, and the kids.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.339
You'll see once you
get to know them.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.301
And if you feel up to it,

14:05.345 --> 14:07.136
you can go with them to
Tommy's soccer game tomorrow,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.389
it'll be fun.
(Samantha chuckles)

14:09.432 --> 14:11.015
- All right, I'll go.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.017
- Great, I'll tell Katie.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.102
- Hey, Dad?

14:14.145 --> 14:14.894
- Yeah?

14:16.648 --> 14:18.356
- I'll always be
your favorite, right?

14:22.821 --> 14:23.611
- You're my girl.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.078
(tense music)

14:38.128 --> 14:40.461
(alarm rings)

14:45.176 --> 14:47.802
(tense music)

14:53.143 --> 14:55.602
(floor creaks)

15:42.317 --> 15:44.067
- Uh, oh.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.902
Uh, (chuckles) you scared me.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.863
I thought you were
still sleeping.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.783
- No, I, I was just
looking for something.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.494
- Anything in particular?

15:56.581 --> 15:58.247
- Yeah, do you have tape?

15:59.334 --> 16:01.417
- Yeah, uh, it's
right here actually.

16:09.094 --> 16:09.801
- Thanks.

16:09.886 --> 16:10.677
- Mm-hmm.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.388
(tense music)

16:13.431 --> 16:16.265
(doorbell rings)

16:36.579 --> 16:37.662
- Much better.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.850
- All right, come on, Tommy!
- Let's go, let's go.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.059
- Let's go!

17:00.103 --> 17:01.310
Come on, Tommy!

17:06.192 --> 17:09.694
- I'm gonna apply to 12
schools, three Ivy League.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.238
I'd love to go to Brown,
that's where you go, right?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.156
- Yeah, I'm taking
the semester off.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.241
- Oh, what's your major?

17:15.285 --> 17:16.701
- Psyche.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.703
Mom wanted me to major
in business, but...

17:20.874 --> 17:21.914
- Yeah!
- Yeah! (crowd cheers)

17:21.958 --> 17:23.415
Yeah!

17:23.460 --> 17:24.375
- Nice one!

17:24.419 --> 17:25.376
- Woo!
- Woo!

17:34.054 --> 17:35.636
- Hey, Lauren.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.471
- Hey, Milo.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.142
- Oh,

17:41.186 --> 17:42.143
Milo.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.354
So, what's the story?

17:46.316 --> 17:47.356
- What story?

17:48.777 --> 17:51.110
- Listen, Miss Innocent,
I can tell you like him.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.445
- It's nothing.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.906
He's a senior anyway, so--

17:54.949 --> 17:55.740
- So?

17:57.077 --> 17:59.327
- I mean, (chuckles)
I've never really, like,

17:59.370 --> 18:00.703
been with a guy
or anything, so--

18:00.747 --> 18:02.163
- Like, not even kissed?

18:02.207 --> 18:02.955
(Lauren chuckles)

18:02.999 --> 18:04.332
I mean, come on.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.709
- Nope, not even kissed.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.669
- Well, we will fix that.

18:18.807 --> 18:19.972
- So, uh,

18:21.017 --> 18:21.849
she cool?

18:23.645 --> 18:26.312
- She seems nice, I haven't
really hung out with her yet.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.564
- Hey, it sucks what
happened to her, man.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.608
Hey, she talk about it yet?

18:30.652 --> 18:33.694
- Nah, man, I think she
wants to forget all that.

18:33.738 --> 18:34.529
- Oh.

18:35.907 --> 18:36.614
- She's hot.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.033
- Samantha looks like

18:39.077 --> 18:40.034
she's getting along
well with everyone.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.119
How's that transition going?

18:41.162 --> 18:42.995
- Yeah, yeah, you know,

18:43.039 --> 18:44.288
I mean, it's only
been a couple of days,

18:44.332 --> 18:46.833
but the way she's getting
along with the kids,

18:46.876 --> 18:49.085
I mean, so far, so good.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.795
- Good.
- Seems promising.

18:50.839 --> 18:51.587
- Good.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.216
- I'm gonna be right back, guys.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.469
- This guy.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.223
- So, can I sit
down with you guys?

19:03.560 --> 19:04.350
- Yeah.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.939
- So you gonna introduce
me to your friend?

19:09.983 --> 19:11.023
- Oh, uh, this is--

19:11.067 --> 19:12.567
- I'm Samantha.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.152
I'm Lauren's sister.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.945
Well, technically, I'm
only her half-sister,

19:15.989 --> 19:18.531
but we are working on being
one big, happy family,

19:18.575 --> 19:19.615
right, sis?

19:19.659 --> 19:20.992
- Yeah, (chuckles) totally.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.160
- Cool.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.828
So what are you, like, a junior?

19:25.081 --> 19:27.165
- Yeah, in college.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.917
You look like you could
be a college boy yourself.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.669
- Oh, yeah? Thanks.

19:31.713 --> 19:35.089
I was thinking Notre
Dame, Coach Academy.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.758
(Lauren chuckles)
- Oh, you mean Notre Dame.

19:37.802 --> 19:38.593
- Notre Dame.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.805
- My dad said not to ask
any questions, all right?

19:44.142 --> 19:45.850
Her mom was in the house
when it burned down.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.768
- (scoffs) More like exploded.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.187
Like, I looked it up, man.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.356
Look, there was nothing left

19:52.400 --> 19:54.025
by the time the fire
department got there.

19:55.486 --> 19:56.652
- All right, well, I'm sure
the last thing she wants

19:56.696 --> 19:57.820
is everyone feeling bad for her,

19:57.864 --> 20:00.656
so just be cool with her,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.825
don't ask any questions.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.869
- I'm gonna get something to
drink, can I get you something?

20:05.788 --> 20:06.787
- Sure.
- Cool.

20:06.831 --> 20:07.747
I'll be right back.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.922
- What is up with you?

20:15.965 --> 20:17.006
- Nothing.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.800
- Come on, tell me.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.929
- You were flirting with him.

20:24.182 --> 20:24.931
- With who?

20:26.059 --> 20:27.892
- Milo. (chuckles)

20:27.936 --> 20:29.810
- What, that?

20:29.854 --> 20:33.064
No, oh, my gosh, don't
be jealous, I was
doing that for you.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.107
It's all a part of my
Lauren and Milo plan,

20:35.151 --> 20:36.359
I promise, trust me.

20:38.196 --> 20:38.945
Yes.

20:41.115 --> 20:41.822
Who's that?

20:43.785 --> 20:45.159
- Ryan?

20:45.203 --> 20:47.495
He's Tommy's soccer coach.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.956
Him and my mom have known each
other since, like, forever.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.541
- And Dad's cool with it?

20:54.003 --> 20:54.961
- I mean, yeah.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.089
I guess, I don't know, why?

20:59.926 --> 21:02.218
- No reason, I'm just gonna
go over and introduce myself.

21:05.014 --> 21:05.972
- Here you go.

21:06.015 --> 21:06.806
- Thanks.

21:09.018 --> 21:09.934
- Where's she going?

21:11.479 --> 21:14.397
- Oh, she's just gonna
introduce herself to Ryan.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.314
Samantha: Hey, Katie.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.482
- Oh, hey, Samantha.

21:16.526 --> 21:17.775
You having a good time?

21:17.819 --> 21:20.111
- Yeah, totally.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.487
Um, wait, I'm Samantha.
- Oh, this is, um...

21:21.531 --> 21:22.446
Sorry.
- Ryan,

21:22.490 --> 21:24.907
it's nice to finally meet you.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.118
- So how do you guys
know each other?

21:27.161 --> 21:29.203
- Oh, well, I met Katie
when we were kids,

21:29.247 --> 21:30.162
we grew up together.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.957
- Did you date?

21:33.001 --> 21:35.918
- No. (chuckles)
- No, uh, just friends.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.253
Since, what, eighth grade?

21:37.297 --> 21:39.380
- No, no, it was
seventh, remember?

21:39.424 --> 21:40.881
Because it was Mrs.
Parker's class. (chuckles)

21:40.925 --> 21:43.175
- Yeah, (chuckles) friends.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.221
- My son, Trevor, and Tommy,
they're on the team together.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.639
They've been best friends
since, what, elementary school?

21:48.683 --> 21:50.558
- Yeah.
- Oh, where's your wife?

21:50.601 --> 21:52.143
- Samantha.

21:52.186 --> 21:55.730
- Uh, it's okay, uh, my
wife died two years ago.

21:55.773 --> 21:58.232
Um, it was tough being
alone with Trevor,

21:58.276 --> 22:01.277
but Katie was really my
rock during that time,

22:01.321 --> 22:04.488
and I'm as grateful to her
and to your dad as I can be.

22:06.367 --> 22:09.243
- So what else do you
do besides coach soccer?

22:09.287 --> 22:12.580
- I'm a mechanic, I have my
own shop over on Brewer Street.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.041
- That is so cool, I
actually love cars.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.960
- You should stop by sometime.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.379
- Well, maybe
Katie will take me.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.342
- Sure, yeah, we
can figure it out.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.886
- Oh, Sam, pizza.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.304
- Well, pizza calls.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.306
Um, it was so nice
to meet you, Ryan.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.432
- Nice to meet you too.

22:49.118 --> 22:52.078
(car horn honks)

22:52.121 --> 22:54.288
- No way, no way,
are you kidding?

22:54.332 --> 22:56.207
You guys got me a car? What?

22:56.250 --> 22:57.625
- Passed your
driver's test, right?

22:57.668 --> 22:59.168
- Yeah, with flying colors,

22:59.212 --> 23:01.170
but I mean, I didn't
expect, like, a car.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.838
Did you know about this?

23:02.882 --> 23:03.964
- Well, I couldn't have you
keep asking 'em to drive mine,

23:04.008 --> 23:05.257
now could I?

23:05.301 --> 23:06.550
- We didn't know
about the color, but--

23:06.594 --> 23:08.469
- No, Mom, please, I
love it, I love it.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.221
Can I go see Trevor?

23:10.264 --> 23:12.848
- Uh, yeah, that's fine,
but please be home by 10,

23:12.892 --> 23:13.641
it is a school night.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.226
- Well, I wanna go too.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.852
- Come on, let's
break this bad boy in.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.273
- Aww, look at that.
(starts car)

23:21.317 --> 23:22.191
- So sweet.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.110
- So cute.
- Bye.

23:24.153 --> 23:27.405
- Don't crash it.
(Katie chuckles)

23:29.992 --> 23:30.866
- Where's my car?

23:32.578 --> 23:33.911
(tense music)

23:33.955 --> 23:35.371
- What do you mean
where's my car?

23:37.125 --> 23:39.750
- Tommy has a car, Lauren
has a car, where's mine?

23:42.547 --> 23:45.548
- Well, Tommy worked
really hard for his car,

23:45.591 --> 23:48.134
and Lauren got straight
A's for three years, and--

23:48.177 --> 23:49.593
- I wasn't talking to you.

23:51.013 --> 23:53.180
I thought that you
said I was special?

23:54.684 --> 23:56.058
- You are special.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.893
- Then why am I
being left out again?

23:59.730 --> 24:01.856
- Look, I know I wasn't there
when you got your license,

24:01.899 --> 24:04.108
and I'm really sorry about that,

24:04.152 --> 24:06.235
but, today's about Tommy,

24:06.279 --> 24:08.237
maybe we could just
cool it a little bit

24:08.281 --> 24:09.155
and talk about it...

24:09.198 --> 24:11.407
(kicks trunk)

24:11.451 --> 24:13.868
- So, everybody gets a fancy car

24:13.911 --> 24:16.662
and I get, what, a pink bear?

24:16.706 --> 24:19.457
I really see where I
fit into this family.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.250
Sorry, maybe Ryan can fix that,

24:21.294 --> 24:23.127
I heard he's good
with his hands.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.095
- That was something.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.430
I hate to say it, babe,

24:34.474 --> 24:36.515
but I'm a little
concerned about Sam.

24:36.559 --> 24:40.728
Jealousy's normal in these
types of new family situations,

24:40.771 --> 24:43.314
but her reactions have
been a little extreme.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.652
- We should get her a car too.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.864
- No, no, no, no, this has
nothing to do with a car,

24:51.908 --> 24:55.326
her jealousy stems
from insecurity

24:55.369 --> 24:58.245
and desperation
for your attention.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.080
Maybe this wasn't the best
time to get Tommy a new car,

25:00.124 --> 25:01.665
but it's done,

25:01.709 --> 25:03.542
now we need to focus on

25:03.586 --> 25:07.588
giving her a greater sense
of security and stability.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.549
- Yeah,

25:10.593 --> 25:11.926
I didn't even think about
how it would make her feel.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.220
I mean, I did miss
her entire childhood.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.639
- I understand that,

25:18.059 --> 25:19.975
but she can't go
around breaking things

25:20.019 --> 25:21.977
every time she gets angry.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.688
And we certainly
cannot reinforce that
behavior with a car.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.234
- You're right.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.443
You're right, I'm sorry.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.321
It's just a lot to take on,

25:32.365 --> 25:33.322
- I know, honey.

25:33.366 --> 25:34.657
- but I have to face it head on.

25:37.453 --> 25:38.619
I'm sorry about your car.

25:38.663 --> 25:39.995
- (chuckles) It's fine.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.413
- You want me to
make it up to you?

25:41.457 --> 25:43.374
(Katie chuckles)

25:43.417 --> 25:44.667
- You're incorrigible.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.626
- You mean insatiable.

25:45.670 --> 25:46.460
- Oh.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.380
- I'll go talk to her.

25:49.423 --> 25:50.381
- Thank you.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.023
(tense music)

26:17.118 --> 26:18.367
- Maybe I should take
one more day off?

26:18.411 --> 26:20.077
- No, we talked about
this last night.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.495
This will give me and Sam

26:21.539 --> 26:23.706
a better chance to get
to know one another.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.250
Plus, I know you're dying
to get back to the hospital.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.334
- You sure?

26:27.378 --> 26:28.294
- I'm sure.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.336
- All right.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.548
Good morning.

26:32.592 --> 26:33.299
- Hey.
- Morning.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.134
- Morning.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.635
- All right, I gotta go to
work, I'll see you guys.

26:36.679 --> 26:37.595
- Love you.
- Bye.

26:37.638 --> 26:38.971
- I love you.
- Love you.

26:39.015 --> 26:41.181
What's got you so
bouncy this morning?

26:41.225 --> 26:42.850
- Nothing, just happy.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.351
Katie: That's good.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.561
- Ah, morning, Sam.

26:45.605 --> 26:46.312
- Morning.
- Morning.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.147
Katie: Morning, Sam.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.857
- Hey, uh, Sam,

26:49.900 --> 26:51.567
couple of the guys from the
team are getting together later,

26:51.611 --> 26:52.776
if you wanna join?

26:52.820 --> 26:54.445
- Yeah, that sounds great.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.238
Lauren,

26:56.282 --> 26:59.533
you should come and put in
some time with you know who.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.410
Lauren: Oh, yeah,
sure. (chuckles)

27:01.454 --> 27:02.328
- Who's you know who?

27:02.371 --> 27:03.829
- Mom, it's nothing.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.247
- Milo Venetta.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.040
- (sighs) Sam.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.916
- Uh, gross.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.667
You like Milo?

27:08.711 --> 27:09.918
- Tommy.

27:09.962 --> 27:10.878
Stop.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.713
- Whatever floats your boat.

27:12.757 --> 27:13.881
- Bye, Sam.

27:13.924 --> 27:14.923
Samantha: Later.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.342
- Bye.
- Bye, have a good day.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.220
How'd you sleep last night?

27:20.264 --> 27:21.138
- Like a rock. (door closes)

27:21.182 --> 27:22.848
- Good.

27:22.892 --> 27:27.227
Um, Samantha, Lauren is a little
shy when it comes to boys,

27:27.271 --> 27:29.980
so I'd appreciate it if
you didn't pressure her.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.775
- Sorry, I was just
trying to help.

27:33.611 --> 27:34.401
- It's okay.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.405
- So, what's the plan?

27:38.449 --> 27:41.450
- Uh, well, I have a client
coming in a couple of minutes.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.536
- What do you do anyway?

27:44.580 --> 27:45.454
- I'm a psychologist.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.623
- Oh, wow, that's intense.

27:47.667 --> 27:50.876
- Um, it can be,
it's very rewarding.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.461
- Yeah.

27:52.505 --> 27:53.837
Do you wanna psychoanalyze
me? (chuckles)

27:53.881 --> 27:55.673
- No, no,

27:55.716 --> 27:58.425
but I would like to get to
know you a little better.

27:58.469 --> 28:00.761
- Yeah, I'd like to get
to know me better too.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.139
- Well, if you ever
wanna talk, I'm here.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.474
(doorbell rings)

28:05.518 --> 28:06.809
Oh, that's my client.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.769
Are you okay for a little while?

28:08.813 --> 28:10.938
- Yeah, I'm just gonna study.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.356
- Great.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.440
Uh, maybe we can
grab lunch later?

28:13.484 --> 28:15.234
- Yeah, that sounds good.

28:20.074 --> 28:22.825
(tense music)

28:22.868 --> 28:24.368
Katie: Heather, how you been?

28:24.412 --> 28:25.160
- Really well.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.496
Katie: Good, come on in.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.374
- It's been a good week.

28:30.418 --> 28:31.500
- Good.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.085
Buttons feeling any better?

28:33.129 --> 28:36.505
- Yes, Buttons is
feeling so much better.

28:36.549 --> 28:39.383
- Come on over here,
I'm all set up.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.433
(tense music)

28:58.195 --> 29:00.571
(pops hood)

29:37.359 --> 29:38.776
So, Tuesday, same time?

29:38.819 --> 29:42.154
- Yes, I'm putting
it in my calendar.

29:42.198 --> 29:42.988
- Heather?

29:44.200 --> 29:45.157
Is that you?

29:45.201 --> 29:46.116
(tense music)

29:46.160 --> 29:47.075
- Samantha, I--

29:47.119 --> 29:48.452
- It's been so long.

29:48.496 --> 29:50.454
Katie: Do you two
know each other?

29:50.498 --> 29:51.705
Samantha: Well, we
used to be friends,

29:51.749 --> 29:53.957
until she disappeared on me.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.751
- I gotta go.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.670
- Well, it was nice
to see you again.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.799
Katie: Heather, wait.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.675
Heather, Heather, talk to me.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.761
Heather, Heather,
what do you need?

30:05.805 --> 30:07.346
Talk to me, what do you need?

30:07.389 --> 30:08.263
- What is she doing here?

30:08.307 --> 30:08.972
Why would you have her here?

30:09.016 --> 30:10.724
- Who, Samantha?

30:10.768 --> 30:13.393
- I can't, I can't be here
anymore, I have to go!

30:13.437 --> 30:14.645
- Wait, that's the Sam?

30:23.030 --> 30:24.780
(knock at door)

30:24.824 --> 30:25.614
Hey.

30:25.658 --> 30:26.990
Samantha: Hey.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.325
- You still wanna
grab some lunch?

30:28.369 --> 30:29.117
- Yeah, sure.

30:30.371 --> 30:31.745
- So how do you know Heather?

30:33.582 --> 30:36.333
- Uh, I spent a lot of time
around here a while back.

30:36.377 --> 30:38.418
Did you know she's a
lifeguard at the beach?

30:39.672 --> 30:40.963
- Small world, isn't it?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.217
- I can't wait until
I see Heather again,

30:45.261 --> 30:49.429
we have so much to talk about.
(tense music)

30:51.767 --> 30:54.685
- So I was thinking
Lighthouse Cafe for lunch?

30:54.728 --> 30:56.270
Samantha: Yeah, I'm easy.

30:57.481 --> 30:58.230
- Great.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.787
So when does the
next semester start?

31:13.831 --> 31:15.998
- Um, in a couple of weeks.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.125
Katie: You excited to go back?

31:18.168 --> 31:19.835
- Yeah, I'm excited.

31:19.879 --> 31:20.919
Katie: It's always good

31:20.963 --> 31:21.837
to get back into
your old routine,

31:21.881 --> 31:23.046
it makes you feel normal again.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.715
- What, are you
saying I'm not normal?

31:24.758 --> 31:26.967
- No, no, no, I wasn't
saying that, I just--

31:27.011 --> 31:28.594
Samantha: (chuckles) I'm
just messing with you, Katie.

31:28.637 --> 31:29.845
(Katie chuckles)

31:29.889 --> 31:30.721
Katie: You know, I can help you

31:30.764 --> 31:32.264
with your studies if you want.

31:33.684 --> 31:36.560
- You, you have a PhD, right?

31:36.604 --> 31:39.730
- Yeah, I got it
after I had Tommy.

31:39.773 --> 31:40.731
(water sprays)
(car beeps)

31:40.774 --> 31:41.690
What the heck?

31:53.454 --> 31:54.870
Oh my.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.706
Oh, god, that cannot be good.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.584
Oh.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.172
- You have to, yeah.

32:07.301 --> 32:08.467
(Katie pops hood)

32:08.510 --> 32:10.969
(Katie groans)

32:13.724 --> 32:16.058
- (groans) This can't be good.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.685
Let me call Ryan, hold on, um...

32:19.980 --> 32:21.939
(tense music)

32:21.982 --> 32:24.608
Hey, Ry, yeah, it's me,
do you have a minute?

32:26.153 --> 32:29.613
I think my car is overheating,
I'm with Samantha.

32:29.657 --> 32:32.449
Uh, yeah, we're on Elkmont Road.

32:33.702 --> 32:34.993
Great.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.453
Thank you so much.

32:36.497 --> 32:37.871
Okay, yeah, we'll be here, bye.

32:40.334 --> 32:41.291
Okay.

32:41.335 --> 32:42.876
Um, Ryan's gonna come help.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.462
I am so sorry, I hope
you're not too hungry?

32:45.506 --> 32:47.172
- Oh, no, it's totally fine.

32:47.216 --> 32:50.676
That's so nice of Ryan to just
come running when you call.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.178
- Yeah, well, I'm useless
when it comes to cars.

32:53.222 --> 32:54.638
I leave that to
Ryan and your dad.

32:54.682 --> 32:55.847
Samantha: Mm-hmm.

32:58.394 --> 33:00.185
- Look, Samantha,

33:00.229 --> 33:02.854
Ryan and I have been
friends since junior high,

33:02.898 --> 33:03.814
I love your father.

33:05.150 --> 33:08.568
- Okay, did I say any different?

33:08.612 --> 33:12.656
- No, I just want you
to be able to trust me

33:12.700 --> 33:14.866
and know that I'm
here for you, okay?

33:14.910 --> 33:15.742
Whatever you need.

33:17.079 --> 33:19.371
- I had a mom, I don't
need another one.

33:24.670 --> 33:25.627
(Katie sighs)

33:25.671 --> 33:26.420
- (groans) God.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.014
- All right, radiator
hose is busted.

33:37.057 --> 33:39.683
It's not a big fix, but
definitely important.

33:39.727 --> 33:40.726
- Okay.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.228
- Ryan, is that a,

33:43.272 --> 33:44.438
is that a '68?

33:45.858 --> 33:47.607
- You do like cars.

33:47.651 --> 33:52.446
- Yeah, my ex was way into
cars, so, he taught me a lot.

33:55.159 --> 33:56.450
- Thank you so much, Ryan,

33:56.493 --> 33:58.994
this is honestly
above and beyond.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.787
- Oh, anything for you, Katie.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.789
- Hey, are you gonna go
to that thing on Saturday?

34:02.833 --> 34:04.624
- Yeah,

34:04.668 --> 34:06.835
I think we're probably gonna
show up maybe around 5:30,

34:08.547 --> 34:10.589
and, um, maybe I'll see you the
next day at practice, right?

34:10.632 --> 34:12.966
- Yes.
(tense music)

34:13.010 --> 34:14.926
(Katie snaps pictures)

34:14.969 --> 34:16.428
(Katie snaps pictures)
Okay, yeah.

34:16.472 --> 34:17.387
Ryan: Trevor and I will
meet you over there,

34:17.431 --> 34:18.346
we'll go out for
ice cream after.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.222
Katie: Oh, that'd be so great--

34:19.266 --> 34:21.600
- Are you guys done yet? (sighs)

34:21.643 --> 34:24.018
- Uh, I'm gonna need
some time with this.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.771
Uh, maybe I can lend
you my car for the day

34:25.813 --> 34:26.813
while I fix this?

34:26.857 --> 34:28.482
- No, you do not
have to do that.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.815
- No, it's all right,

34:29.860 --> 34:31.068
I'll drive your car back
home when it's done,

34:31.110 --> 34:33.110
and I'll pick up my car there.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.405
- That would actually be
awesome, thank you so much,

34:35.449 --> 34:36.447
I really appreciate it.

34:36.492 --> 34:37.783
- Yeah, have fun at lunch.

34:37.826 --> 34:38.742
Katie: We will.

34:38.827 --> 34:39.784
- Thanks.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.746
- Oh, rats, I have a
patient coming in 10,

34:43.791 --> 34:45.916
do you mind if we
rain-check, Sam?

34:45.958 --> 34:46.792
- No worries.

34:48.253 --> 34:49.002
- Okay.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.882
(tense music)

35:13.904 --> 35:14.945
- Oh!
- Oh!

35:14.988 --> 35:17.030
(laughter)

35:17.074 --> 35:18.198
- What'd I say, Tommy?

35:18.242 --> 35:19.991
- Okay, you won.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.745
- All right, Sam
versus Lauren now.

35:23.789 --> 35:24.621
- It's a done deal.

35:24.665 --> 35:25.705
- Woo!

35:25.749 --> 35:26.790
- You wanna go?
- Get in here.

35:26.834 --> 35:27.624
- All right.

35:27.668 --> 35:28.416
- Go for it. (chuckles)

35:28.460 --> 35:29.334
- All right, let's go.

35:32.631 --> 35:33.463
- Woo.

35:33.507 --> 35:35.298
- All right, all right.

35:37.678 --> 35:38.552
- Okay, ready?
- Okay, ready?

35:38.595 --> 35:40.011
- Count in, please, boys.

35:40.055 --> 35:40.971
Milo: Ready?

35:41.014 --> 35:42.013
On three.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.014
- One,
- One,

35:43.058 --> 35:43.807
- two,
- two,

35:43.851 --> 35:45.016
- three.
- three.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.228
(tense music)

35:51.400 --> 35:52.691
- I think Lauren's got it.

36:03.871 --> 36:05.036
- They're down there
for a long time, dude.

36:05.080 --> 36:05.829
- Yeah.

36:05.873 --> 36:06.913
- Damn.

36:10.711 --> 36:12.544
(Lauren coughs)

36:12.588 --> 36:13.879
- What was that?

36:13.922 --> 36:15.714
- What was what?

36:15.757 --> 36:18.133
- You were holding my legs
and I couldn't breathe.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.926
- What are you talking about?

36:19.970 --> 36:21.720
- Did you see that?

36:21.763 --> 36:24.931
- Uh, no, you were
under water, so...

36:29.771 --> 36:31.897
- Okay, who's gonna,
who's gonna go against me?

36:31.940 --> 36:33.190
- This guy. (chuckles)

36:33.233 --> 36:33.982
- All right.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.903
(tense music)

36:44.328 --> 36:45.118
- Woo!

36:56.340 --> 36:57.130
Katie: Hey.

36:59.509 --> 37:00.634
Everything all right?

37:00.677 --> 37:02.552
- It's fine, Mom.

37:02.596 --> 37:04.679
- Uh, it doesn't
seem fine, what's up?

37:05.849 --> 37:07.432
- It's...

37:07.476 --> 37:09.893
Really, I'm okay,
I'm gonna go wash up.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.397
(tense music)

37:26.536 --> 37:28.828
(pats car)

37:32.668 --> 37:34.084
- Are you sure I can't convince
you to stay for dinner?

37:34.127 --> 37:36.086
- Oh, not tonight, Kitty Kat.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.587
- Oh my, Kitty Kat?

37:37.631 --> 37:39.631
You haven't called me that in...

37:39.675 --> 37:41.091
- It still works.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.092
- No.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.135
- Hey, I got something for you.

37:44.179 --> 37:44.970
- What?

37:46.098 --> 37:47.013
- Check that out.
- What?

37:47.057 --> 37:50.267
Oh, my gosh.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.601
Is this from the
River Run Festival?

37:51.645 --> 37:52.978
(tense music)
- Yeah, yeah. (chuckles)

37:53.021 --> 37:54.187
- [Katie] Wow.
(Samantha snaps pictures)

37:54.231 --> 37:55.480
- Hey, you remember
when that drunk guy

37:55.524 --> 37:56.481
spilled his beer all over me?
(Katie chuckles)

37:56.525 --> 37:57.857
That was crazy,
- Yes.

37:57.901 --> 38:00.026
- but not as crazy as
when you bought one

38:00.070 --> 38:02.362
and spilled it all over
yourself so I wouldn't be alone.

38:02.406 --> 38:04.447
- Can I be honest with you?

38:04.491 --> 38:06.408
I did not do that on purpose.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.284
- You didn't?

38:07.327 --> 38:08.576
- No. (chuckles)

38:08.620 --> 38:10.078
No, I fell and
spilled it all over,

38:10.122 --> 38:11.579
and I was playing it off
(tense music)

38:11.623 --> 38:13.290
like I did it on purpose
to be a good friend,

38:13.333 --> 38:14.124
(Ryan chuckles)
but in reality,

38:14.167 --> 38:16.918
I, uh, was a total klutz.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.421
- Sorry, am I interrupting?

38:19.464 --> 38:21.047
- Oh, hey, Sam.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.383
Nah, um, I was just
dropping your mom's car off.

38:25.012 --> 38:25.927
See you later.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.554
- Bye, Ry, I owe you, thank you.

38:29.891 --> 38:30.682
- See ya.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.616
Tommy: That swimming
really killed me today.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.577
- I told you I'd kick your butt.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.245
- Yeah, okay, you may
be good in the water,

38:52.289 --> 38:54.164
but just wait til we
get on, like, a run.

38:54.207 --> 38:55.123
Samantha: That sounds
like a challenge.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.458
Tommy: Well, what if it is?

38:56.501 --> 38:57.834
Samantha: Then,
challenge accepted.

38:57.878 --> 38:58.668
- Yes.

38:58.712 --> 38:59.461
Lauren, you down?

39:01.298 --> 39:03.840
- Uh, I don't know,

39:03.884 --> 39:05.800
Student Council's starting
to plan Homecoming,

39:05.844 --> 39:07.844
so, I'm really busy.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.681
- Tommy, you should
invite Milo again,

39:11.725 --> 39:14.517
I'm sure Lauren would love that.

39:14.561 --> 39:17.896
- Lauren likes Milo,
Lauren likes Milo,

39:17.939 --> 39:19.064
- No, I don't!
- Lauren likes Milo.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.398
Greg: Hello?

39:20.442 --> 39:21.483
- Dad.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.484
- Ooh, dinner, sorry I'm late.

39:23.904 --> 39:25.695
- Uh, Mom, can I be excused?

39:25.739 --> 39:26.821
I've got a lot of work to do.

39:26.865 --> 39:27.989
Katie: Yeah, sweetie.

39:32.662 --> 39:34.287
- What's going on?

39:34.331 --> 39:36.706
- Oh, nothing, Lauren just has
a crush on a boy at school,

39:36.750 --> 39:37.832
and she won't admit it.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.042
Lauren: No, I don't!

39:41.296 --> 39:42.545
- Samantha, I would
really appreciate it

39:42.589 --> 39:44.255
if you didn't tease
Lauren like that.

39:45.634 --> 39:48.093
- Wait, seriously?

39:48.136 --> 39:49.886
- Yeah, seriously.

39:50.931 --> 39:52.263
I think you owe her an apology.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.187
- Uh, fine.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.204
(tense music)

40:22.212 --> 40:24.254
(sighs)

40:25.424 --> 40:27.757
Oh, Ryan, you are so boring.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.489
- What were you doing in there?

40:51.533 --> 40:52.282
- Nothing.

40:53.994 --> 40:55.618
Oh, Lauren, um...

40:57.247 --> 40:58.246
- Yeah?

41:00.834 --> 41:01.749
- Goodnight.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.297
(tense music)

41:09.843 --> 41:13.178
Katie: Hey, thanks for
backing me up down there.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.471
Greg: You're really
upset about that?

41:14.514 --> 41:16.556
- You rolled your
eyes, it's not cool.

41:18.310 --> 41:21.686
- I just think you're making
it out to be more than it is.

41:21.730 --> 41:24.314
- You haven't been
around the last few days,

41:24.357 --> 41:25.607
but that's not the first time

41:25.650 --> 41:27.275
I've had to say something to her

41:27.319 --> 41:29.235
about how she's
speaking to my daughter.

41:29.279 --> 41:30.612
- Your daughter?

41:30.655 --> 41:33.114
You don't mean our daughter?

41:33.158 --> 41:34.240
- That's not what I meant, okay?

41:34.284 --> 41:35.074
Don't twist my words,

41:35.118 --> 41:38.453
I'm just saying that

41:38.497 --> 41:42.081
Samantha has a lot of influence.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.500
Okay, she's older,

41:43.543 --> 41:45.627
she's getting
attention from boys

41:45.670 --> 41:47.629
that Lauren's interested in,

41:47.672 --> 41:49.422
even Tommy seems
to be on her side,

41:49.466 --> 41:51.758
I just don't want everybody
ganging up on Lauren.

41:53.512 --> 41:56.846
- I just think you
need to relax a little

41:56.890 --> 41:58.389
and stop worrying about

41:58.433 --> 42:00.141
preventing problems
before they start.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.436
- Look, I know you're
off saving lives,

42:03.480 --> 42:05.438
but I'm trying to keep
the peace around here,

42:05.482 --> 42:09.192
and, I, I, we just, we need
to have a united front, okay?

42:09.236 --> 42:12.529
So if I say something, I
need you to back me up.

42:13.573 --> 42:14.364
- Okay.

42:15.450 --> 42:16.241
- Say it.

42:17.702 --> 42:18.993
- I'll back you up.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.370
- Damn right you will.

42:20.413 --> 42:21.663
- Ooh, yeah,

42:21.706 --> 42:23.039
(Katie chuckles)

42:23.083 --> 42:24.624
I will back you
up, Mrs. Carlisle.

42:24.668 --> 42:26.209
- It's Dr. Carlisle.

42:26.253 --> 42:28.920
- Oh, excuse me,
Doctor. (Katie chuckles)

42:28.964 --> 42:30.547
- But, I'm serious.

42:30.590 --> 42:33.049
- Oh, I am so serious,
(Katie chuckles) so serious.

42:34.094 --> 42:36.427
(tense music)

43:24.603 --> 43:27.395
(buzzes buzzer)

43:31.818 --> 43:32.525
(buzzer buzzes)

43:32.569 --> 43:35.069
(door opens)

44:55.652 --> 44:58.319
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

44:58.363 --> 44:59.487
Samantha: Happy anniversary.

44:59.531 --> 45:01.531
- Oh, you guys.

45:01.574 --> 45:04.450
Aww, oh, my gosh.
- Pancakes.

45:04.494 --> 45:05.451
- This looks beautiful.

45:05.495 --> 45:07.453
- Tommy helped this time.

45:07.497 --> 45:08.246
- Beautiful, oh.

45:09.332 --> 45:10.790
Oh, come on.

45:10.834 --> 45:12.667
Oh, look. (chuckles)

45:12.711 --> 45:14.460
Greg: (chuckles) Yes.

45:14.504 --> 45:15.962
- You guys.
- I love it.

45:16.005 --> 45:17.380
Katie: That's great.

45:17.424 --> 45:19.132
- Thank you.

45:19.175 --> 45:23.136
- All right, well, while
we're handing out surprises...

45:23.179 --> 45:24.679
- No, we said we weren't gonna
give each other anything.

45:24.723 --> 45:27.265
- No, you said that.
(Lauren chuckles)

45:27.308 --> 45:29.475
It's our anniversary, of course
I'm gonna get you something.

45:29.519 --> 45:31.519
- Oh my, how did you do this?

45:31.563 --> 45:32.729
- Third row center,
(Katie gasps)

45:32.772 --> 45:34.480
and I got us a
suite at the London.

45:34.524 --> 45:36.733
- Oh, thanks, honey.

45:36.776 --> 45:40.611
- And we got you reservations
at Asterio Romana.

45:40.655 --> 45:41.696
- Oh, my goodness.
(Greg chuckles)

45:41.740 --> 45:43.614
- I just wanted to say

45:44.784 --> 45:47.952
the past month has
been so special to me.

45:47.996 --> 45:51.247
You guys, you brought
me into your family,

45:51.291 --> 45:54.709
you made me feel so
welcome, so, thank you,

45:54.753 --> 45:57.545
and happy anniversary.

45:57.589 --> 46:01.799
- Oh, come here, you guys.
(soft music)

46:01.843 --> 46:03.551
Oh, cuddles.

46:03.595 --> 46:07.096
- All right, get in
here, get in here.

46:07.140 --> 46:07.472
(Katie chuckles)

46:29.579 --> 46:32.497
(Katie chuckles)

46:35.752 --> 46:37.919
- Where are my pictures?

46:37.962 --> 46:39.378
(tense music)

46:39.422 --> 46:40.379
Hey, Greg?

46:40.423 --> 46:41.964
Greg: Katie, are you ready?

46:43.510 --> 46:44.300
- Uh...

46:45.678 --> 46:47.470
Yeah, yeah, coming.

46:59.818 --> 47:00.983
- In case you need anything.

47:01.027 --> 47:02.401
- Thank you.

47:02.445 --> 47:03.528
- We can trust you guys
for one night, right?

47:03.571 --> 47:04.946
- Yes.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.906
- We'll be back tomorrow
afternoon, be good.

47:06.950 --> 47:08.324
Eat, do your homework.

47:08.368 --> 47:09.325
Love you.

47:09.369 --> 47:10.827
- Love you.
- Bye, have fun.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.371
- Bye, we love you.
- Love you, you deserve this,

47:13.414 --> 47:15.581
enjoy it.
(door closes)

47:15.625 --> 47:17.333
(car starts)
- So,

47:17.377 --> 47:19.919
I think I'm gonna tell a
few friends to swing by.

47:21.130 --> 47:23.673
You should invite Milo.

47:23.758 --> 47:25.091
- What?

47:25.134 --> 47:27.635
No, that'd be weird,
he'll think I like him.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.554
- But you do like him.

47:29.597 --> 47:30.930
- You don't have to
invite just Milo,

47:30.974 --> 47:32.431
you can invite other people.

47:32.475 --> 47:34.600
- Uh, we can't have a party.

47:34.644 --> 47:36.102
- Who said it was a party?

47:36.145 --> 47:37.937
Tommy, did you call it a party?

47:37.981 --> 47:39.313
- I never called it a party.

47:39.357 --> 47:40.982
- So, should we do it?

47:42.986 --> 47:45.695
- Okay, fine, sure, let's do it.

47:45.738 --> 47:48.614
- Okay, um, Tommy, invite Milo.

47:48.658 --> 47:49.657
- I already texted him.

47:49.701 --> 47:50.783
- Great, sounds good.

47:55.665 --> 48:00.543
(rap music)
(indistinct chatter)

48:18.521 --> 48:19.604
Why are you all by yourself?

48:19.647 --> 48:21.147
It's a party.

48:21.190 --> 48:22.273
- I'm tired.

48:23.985 --> 48:27.778
- Well, just so you know,
Milo was just looking for you.

48:33.411 --> 48:35.786
Now you're not so tired.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.747
- What did he say?

48:37.790 --> 48:39.624
- Okay, he told me
that he wants to have

48:39.667 --> 48:41.959
some alone time with you,

48:42.003 --> 48:43.961
you know, to get
to know you better.

48:45.381 --> 48:47.465
- Really? (chuckles)

48:47.508 --> 48:49.425
Well, I mean, if he
wants to talk to me...

48:50.845 --> 48:52.803
- I mean, you should
go to your bedroom.

48:55.558 --> 48:56.349
- Okay.

48:58.102 --> 49:01.979
- Hey, we're having fun, man,
we're having fun. (chuckles)

49:03.983 --> 49:05.983
Ooh, give me that bone.

49:06.027 --> 49:08.778
- Hey, uh, Milo, can I
talk to you for a second?

49:09.989 --> 49:10.947
- Sure.

49:10.990 --> 49:12.698
- Okay, I'm gonna help you out.

49:12.742 --> 49:14.241
- Oh, yeah?

49:14.285 --> 49:15.534
Do I need help?

49:15.578 --> 49:17.411
- Well, you know Lauren,

49:17.455 --> 49:21.123
she kind of has a thing for you.

49:21.167 --> 49:22.875
She actually wants
you to go meet her

49:22.919 --> 49:24.877
in her bedroom right now.

49:26.214 --> 49:27.838
- For real?

49:27.882 --> 49:31.008
- Yeah, so you should
probably go take care of her.

49:31.052 --> 49:32.885
- Oh, um, I don't know,

49:33.846 --> 49:36.555
I'm not into her, I'm into you.

49:37.892 --> 49:39.517
(Samantha chuckles)

49:39.560 --> 49:43.229
- Oh, okay, well, um, maybe
if you go take care of her,

49:44.482 --> 49:45.690
I'll take care of you.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.234
- Really?

49:48.277 --> 49:49.402
- Yeah, really.

49:50.863 --> 49:52.238
- Okay.

49:52.281 --> 49:54.490
- (gasps) Oh, Milo,
um, between you and me,

49:54.534 --> 49:55.825
Lauren confessed to me

49:55.868 --> 50:00.079
that she's kind of into
some weirder stuff.

50:00.123 --> 50:00.997
- Weird stuff like?

50:02.792 --> 50:05.543
- I don't know, I don't
wanna judge her, but, um,

50:05.586 --> 50:07.586
I think she likes
it pretty rough.

50:10.883 --> 50:11.882
- Okay.

50:17.140 --> 50:19.140
- Sam. (chuckles)

50:19.183 --> 50:20.808
What's up?
- Hey, not much.

50:20.852 --> 50:21.559
- You having fun?

50:21.602 --> 50:22.393
- Yeah.

50:22.437 --> 50:23.269
- Love it, cheers.

50:23.312 --> 50:24.186
- Cheers.

50:29.861 --> 50:30.860
- Hey.

50:32.071 --> 50:32.862
- Hey.

50:40.955 --> 50:43.581
Uh, you're a really
good soccer player,

50:43.624 --> 50:45.541
like, really good.

50:47.962 --> 50:51.047
- I mean, for Saint Francis,
maybe, but, Notre Dame?

50:52.216 --> 50:53.424
- You got in to Notre Dame?

50:53.468 --> 50:54.800
- Yeah.

50:54.844 --> 50:55.801
- Oh, wow.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.304
That's insane.

51:00.058 --> 51:03.809
You'd do great at Notre Dame,
it's a really good school,

51:03.853 --> 51:07.897
and you'd get an amazing
education, and being there...

51:21.621 --> 51:22.536
Wait.

51:22.580 --> 51:23.913
- What's wrong?

51:23.956 --> 51:25.414
- It's just a little
too fast for me.

51:25.458 --> 51:26.248
(tense music)

51:26.292 --> 51:27.750
Milo: Don't worry.

51:27.794 --> 51:29.043
- Milo, stop.

51:29.087 --> 51:29.835
Milo: Come on, we're
just having a good time.

51:29.879 --> 51:31.170
- No, please.

51:34.759 --> 51:35.508
(Samantha snaps picture)

51:35.551 --> 51:36.467
Milo, stop.

51:37.845 --> 51:39.512
Milo: It's okay, relax.

51:39.555 --> 51:42.056
Lauren: Please, it's
too fast for me, please.

51:43.476 --> 51:46.977
- Hi, um, I'd like to
file a noise complaint.

51:47.021 --> 51:50.106
Yeah, yeah, it's
at 21 Briar Lane.

51:54.237 --> 51:56.779
(siren wails)

51:59.617 --> 52:03.994
- Guys, the cops are here,
the cops are here, come on!

52:11.087 --> 52:11.877
Come on, we gotta go!

52:13.339 --> 52:14.088
(car approaches)

52:14.132 --> 52:16.841
(Tommy groans)

52:21.722 --> 52:22.847
- Hey, Greg.

52:22.890 --> 52:23.973
- Hey, Jordan.

52:24.016 --> 52:25.432
- Sorry to give this to you.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.144
See you in church Sunday?

52:28.187 --> 52:29.395
Greg: I'll see you,
thanks for coming out.

52:29.438 --> 52:30.521
Jordan: No problem.

52:33.526 --> 52:35.067
(Katie sighs)

52:35.111 --> 52:37.486
Katie: Samantha, we trusted you.

52:37.530 --> 52:40.531
We left you in charge, how
could you let this happen?

52:40.575 --> 52:41.574
- Wait, me?

52:41.617 --> 52:43.033
It wasn't my idea,

52:43.077 --> 52:44.910
Lauren's the one that
wanted to have a party.

52:46.914 --> 52:50.541
- I know Lauren, she would
never do something like this.

52:50.585 --> 52:53.002
- Katie, they're teenagers,
this is what teenagers do,

52:53.045 --> 52:54.712
we can't blame it all on Sam.

52:54.755 --> 52:56.547
- Lauren wanted to
invite Milo over,

52:56.591 --> 52:58.799
but didn't have the
guts to invite just him,

52:58.843 --> 53:00.593
so she wanted a party.

53:00.636 --> 53:02.178
- I wanted him to come over,

53:02.221 --> 53:04.847
but I didn't think it was
gonna get this out of hand.

53:04.891 --> 53:06.056
I'm sorry.

53:08.603 --> 53:09.768
- Are you okay, sweetie?

53:11.022 --> 53:12.730
- I have to go to bed.

53:16.485 --> 53:18.903
- Okay, (sighs) it's been a
long night, we're all tired,

53:18.946 --> 53:22.865
let's, we'll talk about
it in the morning?

53:22.909 --> 53:23.908
Let's go.

53:26.495 --> 53:27.244
- Come on.

53:33.169 --> 53:35.461
(phone rings)

53:45.431 --> 53:48.015
(tense music)

53:54.565 --> 53:57.107
(message notification)

53:57.151 --> 53:59.360
(message notification)

53:59.403 --> 54:02.696
(message notification)

54:21.968 --> 54:23.300
(sighs)

54:33.312 --> 54:34.603
- But like a day's training.

54:34.689 --> 54:35.980
- Okay.

54:36.023 --> 54:36.897
Samantha: You know?
You know what I mean.

54:36.941 --> 54:38.941
- She's coming right now.

54:42.989 --> 54:44.989
Yo, I told you she
had nice legs, bro.

54:46.742 --> 54:48.742
- Hey, you can't let him talk
to your sister like that.

54:48.786 --> 54:50.703
Milo: Hey, Lauren,
where you going?

54:50.746 --> 54:51.704
Lauren?

54:51.747 --> 54:52.788
- Yo, what the hell, Milo?

54:54.500 --> 54:55.666
- Hey, what's up, Tommy?

54:59.714 --> 55:01.964
- Why are you talking
to my sister like that?

55:02.008 --> 55:03.674
- It's not my fault
your sister's so easy.

55:05.511 --> 55:07.594
- Why don't you just leave
her alone, all right?

55:07.638 --> 55:10.723
- Security, hey, there's a
fight happening over there,

55:10.766 --> 55:11.807
those two kids.

55:14.854 --> 55:16.895
- Yo, none of us buy that
innocent act anymore.

55:16.939 --> 55:17.688
She's a freak.

55:19.400 --> 55:20.482
She likes it rough.

55:21.277 --> 55:22.943
- Yeah, ha.

55:22.987 --> 55:23.902
- Yo, what the--
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

55:23.946 --> 55:25.029
whoa, relax, relax.

55:25.072 --> 55:26.363
I saw that, I saw
that, I saw that,

55:26.407 --> 55:27.323
- Yeah, he saw it.
- Let's go, Tommy.

55:27.366 --> 55:29.074
- Relax, relax.
- I'm sorry.

55:29.118 --> 55:30.743
Yeah, not so pretty
anymore, are you?

55:37.084 --> 55:38.709
- You guys are home late.

55:38.753 --> 55:39.960
What's up?

55:40.004 --> 55:42.296
- I don't wanna talk about it.

55:42.340 --> 55:44.214
- Are they always this moody?

55:45.551 --> 55:46.342
- No,

55:47.428 --> 55:48.177
they're not.

55:49.513 --> 55:51.847
(tense music)

55:55.811 --> 55:57.353
(knock at door)

55:57.396 --> 55:59.021
Lauren, honey, can I come in?

56:01.108 --> 56:01.857
Hey,

56:03.944 --> 56:05.611
what's going on?

56:05.654 --> 56:06.362
- Nothing.

56:08.449 --> 56:10.657
- It's okay, is it
something at school?

56:11.660 --> 56:13.118
(Lauren sighs)

56:13.162 --> 56:14.995
We can talk about it, I
promise we can fix this.

56:15.039 --> 56:16.705
- No, we can't.

56:16.749 --> 56:19.291
Nothing is okay,
it is all my fault.

56:21.045 --> 56:23.837
- Sweetheart, you gotta tell
me what's going on, okay?

56:23.881 --> 56:25.422
That's the only
way I can help you.

56:27.385 --> 56:29.760
- Samantha said
that Milo liked me,

56:29.804 --> 56:33.639
that he wanted to get
to know me better,

56:33.682 --> 56:37.810
and that I should have
him up in my room,

56:39.522 --> 56:43.190
and we started kissing,
and I wasn't ready,

56:43.234 --> 56:45.234
and then things got aggressive.

56:45.277 --> 56:48.070
- Sweetheart, this
is not your fault.

56:48.114 --> 56:50.197
- Yes, it is.

56:50.241 --> 56:52.741
And he's got a picture of me.

56:52.785 --> 56:53.992
I don't know how he took it,

56:54.036 --> 56:56.078
but he sent it to
all of his friends,

56:56.122 --> 56:57.996
and now everyone thinks
I had sex with him.

56:59.417 --> 57:02.626
And the thing is, is
I really liked him.

57:06.048 --> 57:07.840
- (sighs) Oh, honey.

57:07.883 --> 57:11.552
Milo was trying to take
advantage of you, okay?

57:11.595 --> 57:12.928
You didn't do anything wrong.

57:13.889 --> 57:15.347
Come here, sweetheart.

57:15.391 --> 57:16.890
Oh.

57:16.934 --> 57:18.976
It's gonna be okay, all right?

57:20.604 --> 57:21.353
- Thanks, Mom.

57:23.399 --> 57:25.983
(Katie sighs)

57:28.946 --> 57:31.238
Katie: So, what
happened with you?

57:38.622 --> 57:40.372
- Mom, I'm sorry, but,

57:42.543 --> 57:44.918
I got suspended for punching
Milo Venetta in the face.

57:46.839 --> 57:47.838
- Wow.

57:49.842 --> 57:53.677
Well, punching someone
is never a good idea,

57:54.889 --> 57:58.223
but I think I understand
why you did it.

57:59.935 --> 58:01.477
- Yeah?

58:01.520 --> 58:03.770
- Lauren told me what happened.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.731
- He had a picture of her.

58:05.774 --> 58:07.107
He showed it around like,

58:07.151 --> 58:09.359
like it was some
trophy or something.

58:09.403 --> 58:10.736
Lauren's not like that.

58:10.779 --> 58:11.945
(door opens)

58:11.989 --> 58:12.988
Greg Hello, I'm home.

58:14.492 --> 58:16.116
- Well, I am very proud of you

58:16.160 --> 58:17.784
for standing up for your sister.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.079
- Thanks, Mom.

58:21.123 --> 58:22.164
- But you're grounded.

58:27.129 --> 58:29.713
(tense music)

58:36.764 --> 58:37.554
Hey.

58:38.891 --> 58:39.932
- Hey.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.434
What's going on?

58:42.478 --> 58:43.936
Samantha just told me
that Tommy got suspended.

58:45.814 --> 58:46.772
- Let's go upstairs.

59:08.379 --> 59:10.963
I think there's something
wrong with Samantha.

59:11.006 --> 59:12.256
- What are you talking about?

59:12.299 --> 59:14.174
- You know that party
wasn't Lauren's idea.

59:14.218 --> 59:15.509
- (sighs) Lauren
said it was her idea,

59:15.553 --> 59:18.303
why are you trying to
make it Sam's fault?

59:18.347 --> 59:21.765
- I'm not trying to make it
Sam's fault, it's the truth.

59:21.809 --> 59:23.934
- It's not like they
threw some rager.

59:23.978 --> 59:27.187
- They did throw a rager,
she bought them alcohol.

59:27.231 --> 59:30.482
- Katie, I think
you're overreacting.

59:30.526 --> 59:31.942
- I'm overreacting?

59:31.986 --> 59:34.444
Did you know that
Lauren almost got raped?

59:34.488 --> 59:36.280
- What?

59:36.323 --> 59:38.907
- Yeah, and guess who set
that up to happen, Samantha.

59:41.203 --> 59:43.203
- Okay, (scoffs)

59:43.247 --> 59:45.247
I mean, can you even
hear yourself right now?

59:45.291 --> 59:47.374
- Greg, I think
you're so wrapped up

59:47.418 --> 59:48.792
in trying to get
Samantha to like you

59:48.836 --> 59:50.627
that you're not
actually parenting her.

59:53.549 --> 59:56.133
- Please don't tell me how
to talk to my daughter.

59:56.176 --> 59:58.218
- What about your
other daughter?

59:58.262 --> 01:00:00.053
I mean, have you even
spoken to Lauren?

01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:04.016
(pager beeps)

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:05.142
(Katie sighs)

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:07.769
(pager beeps)

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:10.856
(Greg sighs)

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:11.648
Greg: I have to go.

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:13.317
- Of course you do.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.818
- Katie, can we please talk
about this some other time?

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:17.070
I have so much going on
at the hospital right now.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.822
- What choice do I have?

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:22.534
Go, just go.
(tense music)

01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:23.785
Greg: Okay.

01:00:30.419 --> 01:00:32.252
Announcer: Good morning,
North Valley residents,

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:36.131
it's the Morning News
with Elaine Paige.

01:00:36.175 --> 01:00:38.342
- Lauren hasn't
spoken to me in days,

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.844
like, what's her problem?

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:42.471
- I don't know,

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:43.805
I think she's still pretty
upset from the Milo thing.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:46.099
- I told her inviting
him up to her bedroom

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:48.060
would give him the wrong idea.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:50.187
- Wait, she invited him up?

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.396
Lauren said you did.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.189
- Really?

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.942
I don't know why she
would lie to you.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:58.028
I guess she's embarrassed.

01:00:58.072 --> 01:00:59.071
- Yeah, I don't know.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:02.783
- We gotta keep
sticking together,

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.743
I have your back and
you have mine, right?

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.788
- Yeah, for sure.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.623
- I mean, we all had fun at
the party, you had fun, right?

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.166
- Yeah, a great time.

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.793
- Well, we just won't
invite her next time,

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.087
it'll be just the
two of us, deal?

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.463
- Deal.

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:18.715
- Tommy, don't you
have some chores to do?

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:21.468
- I don't think so.

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:23.220
- Thomas, now.

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:25.263
- Fine.

01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:31.144
- Samantha,

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.188
I think you should start
thinking about getting a job.

01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:34.481
- What?

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:35.899
- If you're not gonna
go back to school,

01:01:35.943 --> 01:01:38.568
you need to work,
you're an adult.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:41.029
- But I'm grieving,
Katie, don't you see that?

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.448
Katie: Start looking.

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:44.032
Announcer: Coming up next
on our morning segment,

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:45.826
Katie: Today.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.828
Announcer: what you need to
do to your house this summer.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:52.082
But for now, we transfer over
to our local news broadcast.

01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:54.126
- The search for
22-year-old Heather Hewitt

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:56.002
continues today.
(tense music)

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.587
Hewitt was reported
missing by her parents

01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.297
after she failed to
attend a court hearing

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.341
for a parking violation.

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.093
Authorities have begun

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.178
a search-and-rescue
effort in Sactacose Woods,

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:09.141
a local wildlife--
(Samantha turns off TV)

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:15.981
(Katie sighs)

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.697
Voicemail: You have reached
the voice mailbox of...

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:25.073
Heather: Heather Hewitt.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.243
- Hey, Heather,
it's Katie again.

01:02:28.287 --> 01:02:33.165
Um, I'm sorry to leave
you another message, I,

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:36.209
I'm just checking in, wanna
make sure everything's okay.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:37.586
Uh, give me a call anytime.

01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:39.838
Okay,

01:02:39.882 --> 01:02:41.214
bye.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.592
(tense music)

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:11.286
Hey.

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:16.333
- Oh, hey, Kitty, I
wasn't expecting you.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:19.586
- I know, (sighs) do
you have a minute?

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.921
- Yeah, is everything all right?

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.380
- I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:26.134
but I think there's something
wrong with Samantha.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:28.345
- Is that the scientific
term for it now, Doc?

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:31.723
- I know, I know, but
just listen, she's, it's,

01:03:31.767 --> 01:03:35.519
I'm just getting a really
weird vibe off of her.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.193
- Hello, I'm home.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:46.279
- Hey, Daddy.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.156
- Oh, hey, where is everybody?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.493
- Um, Tommy's upstairs,
Lauren is at school,

01:03:51.537 --> 01:03:53.411
and I think that Katie
went to go see Ryan.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.038
(tense music)

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:57.374
They're pretty
close, aren't they?

01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:00.418
- Well, yeah, I mean,
they have a long history.

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:03.129
- Yeah, they hang out a lot.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:06.383
He just comes over all the
time when you're not around.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:09.219
- What do you mean?

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:17.269
- He just comes over, not to
drop off Trevor or anything.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:19.479
They hang out, they hug a lot,

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.523
like, when they're
laughing and stuff,

01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:24.776
and she actually goes over
to his place a lot too.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:28.363
I can tell they're super close.

01:04:29.408 --> 01:04:30.156
- Yeah.

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:33.451
When did Katie
say she'd be back?

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:36.580
- Uh, she didn't, but I think
she left, like, an hour ago.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.624
I'm gonna go for a run.

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:41.918
- All right.

01:04:41.962 --> 01:04:42.794
- Bye, Daddy.

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.087
- Bye, sweetie.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:50.385
- I just feel like she's
manipulating Greg and the kids.

01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:53.388
I mean, Tommy's suspended,
Lauren is a mess,

01:04:53.432 --> 01:04:55.891
and Greg and I are fighting.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.643
Oh, and this patient of mine,

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:00.061
who apparently knows Samantha,

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:01.187
she saw her at the
house the other day

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.647
and she was terrified,

01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:05.483
like, ran to her car
to get away terrified.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:08.361
And now, after three years of
never missing an appointment,

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.404
she's a no-show.

01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:11.781
- Hey, it's me.

01:05:13.035 --> 01:05:16.369
Are you gonna pick up your phone

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:18.038
or just keep ignoring my calls?

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.706
I've called you,
like, four times.

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:23.668
All right, well,

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:26.087
I guess just give me a
call when you get this.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.551
Is she kidding me right now?

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:34.095
- I know there's something off,

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:36.932
but (sighs) Greg
doesn't wanna hear it,

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:39.684
and, I don't know,
(phone buzzes)

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:42.437
I'm just feeling really alone.

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:44.147
- Katie, you are not alone.

01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:47.776
I mean, I am there for
you if you need anything.

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:51.988
- Thanks, Ry, I appreciate it.
(door opens)

01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:53.281
Greg: What's going on?

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:56.368
- Nothing.

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.745
- Doesn't look like nothing.

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:00.413
- Yeah, I was just
talking to Katie and--

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.375
- He was just supporting me,
Greg, that's all he was doing.

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:05.168
- Oh, that's what you call it?

01:06:05.212 --> 01:06:06.127
'Cause at least I
don't sneak around

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:07.587
behind your back with a friend.

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.297
- (chuckles) Don't
be ridiculous.

01:06:11.218 --> 01:06:13.051
- I'm gonna give you
two some privacy, I...

01:06:13.095 --> 01:06:13.802
- Oh, privacy?

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:14.594
That's rich,

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.012
coming from some guy

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:17.639
who clearly doesn't
understand boundaries.

01:06:17.683 --> 01:06:19.432
- You know, Greg, there's
a lot I wanna say to you,

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:20.934
but I'm not going to.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:22.394
Katie, if you need me, I'm here.

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:23.728
- Okay.

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:24.562
Uh, thanks.

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.608
Greg, you're acting
like a jealous teenager.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.860
- How much time do you spend
with him when I'm not around?

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.405
- Don't talk to me like
you're Mr. Perfect.

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.740
You're never around,

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:38.410
and when you are, now,
it's all about Samantha.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.829
What about Tommy and Lauren?

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:43.248
I mean, can't you see this
family's falling apart?

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.668
(pager beeps)

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:49.212
(Greg sighs)

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.298
- This conversation is not over.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:53.758
- Looks like it is.

01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:57.470
(tense music)

01:07:15.157 --> 01:07:17.532
(Katie sighs)

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.390
(tense music)

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:51.691
- Extra bacon, please.

01:07:53.153 --> 01:07:54.277
Announcer: A little fog
to start off our day,

01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:56.529
we may get some
hints of clouds yet,

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.406
but more clouds and sunny skies.

01:07:59.785 --> 01:08:02.077
And now, over to our
local news broadcast.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.954
- Tragedy has struck our
small community today,

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:07.123
as the search for
Heather Hewitt concluded.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:08.083
(tense music)

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:09.667
Authorities recovered her body

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:12.253
from the northeast quadrant
of Sactacose Woods,

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:15.632
and have opened a criminal
investigation of the case.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:17.509
Hewitt was found with
multiple stab wounds

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.761
in her chest and abdomen,

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:22.388
and the county medical
examiner puts her time of death

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.057
at approximately one week ago,

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.517
which is just a day before

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.393
she was reported
missing by her parents.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.773
There will be a memorial
service for Hewitt

01:08:31.817 --> 01:08:35.401
at the Community Church of
Hempstead later this week.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.028
She is survived by her parents,

01:08:37.072 --> 01:08:38.488
Mark and Barbara,
(glass shatters)

01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:39.697
and her younger brother.
- Oh, my god, Katie,

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.241
why are you yelling at me?

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.118
It was just an accident!

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.618
- What's going on? Are you okay?

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.121
- Katie is yelling at me
because I broke the plate,

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:48.038
and now she's saying
I have to leave!

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:49.499
- Seriously?

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:50.792
- No, that is, that
is not what she did,

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:52.544
she held it up in front
of my face and just...

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:54.002
- Sam, are you okay?

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.255
- I don't wanna talk about it.
(tense music)

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.131
Do you just wanna go
for a run or something?

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.216
- Yeah, let's go.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.759
- No, no, uh, Tommy,

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:02.303
I need you to stay here
and help me with something.

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:04.389
- I'll help you when I get back.

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:05.807
We're gonna be gone
for, like, an hour?

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.058
- No, you can't leave the
house, you're grounded.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:11.604
- First you take my car,
I can't go out at night,

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.273
now I can't even train?

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.567
I thought you understood
why I punched Milo?

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:18.819
- For Pete's sakes, Katie,
let him go for a run.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:21.156
- Unless there's a reason
you don't want him to?

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:26.703
- You guys can go.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.913
- (sighs) Let's go.

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:31.541
- If you ask me,
(tense music)

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:33.542
it sounds like you need to
handle your own jealousy issues.

01:10:02.282 --> 01:10:05.700
- Yeah, wait, hold on, Sam, I
gotta tie my shoe, one second.

01:10:05.744 --> 01:10:07.660
- (sighs) I bet
you can't catch me.

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:11.748
- We'll see about that.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.125
(tense music)

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:25.595
Sam?

01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.347
Samantha: Tommy?

01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:30.391
Tommy?

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:32.894
Tommy?

01:10:32.938 --> 01:10:33.811
- Sam?

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:35.438
Samantha: I'm over here.

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:36.231
- Yo, Sam?

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.110
Sam, where'd you go?

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:43.279
Samantha: Nope,
you're getting warmer.

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:44.113
- Sam?

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:47.867
Sam, where are you?

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:50.328
Sam?

01:10:50.372 --> 01:10:52.872
(Tommy screams)

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.835
- Hey, Tommy?

01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.420
- (groans) Sam?

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:02.257
Sam, why'd you do that?

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:06.344
- I didn't do
anything, you tripped.

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:07.679
- You pushed me down the hill!

01:11:08.807 --> 01:11:10.515
- No, I didn't.

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:13.142
- I need you to call someone,
my leg, I think it's broken.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:14.769
- I don't have service.

01:11:14.813 --> 01:11:16.896
Um, I'm gonna go, I'm
gonna go get Katie.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.690
- No, don't leave me here.

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:21.693
Sam, please don't, Sam.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:24.404
Sam!

01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:58.938
- Katie?

01:11:58.982 --> 01:11:59.981
- Yeah?
- Katie, are you here?

01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:01.149
- Yeah.
- It's Tommy, he fell,

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:02.817
and I think he's
hurt pretty bad.

01:12:02.861 --> 01:12:04.485
- Oh, my god, uh, show me.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:05.653
I got my keys.

01:12:24.716 --> 01:12:26.049
- How's he doing?

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.259
- He's okay now,
but it's not good.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:30.720
- So what happened?

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:35.308
- Tommy went running
with Samantha

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:37.602
and she pushed him down a hill.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.020
- What?

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:40.813
- That's what Tommy
said, and I believe him.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:41.856
Greg, she did it on purpose.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.274
- No, she didn't.

01:12:43.318 --> 01:12:45.818
- Greg, Tommy fell down the hill

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.987
and she didn't even call me.

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:49.864
She walked all the
way home first.

01:12:49.908 --> 01:12:51.949
- Maybe her cell wasn't working,

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:54.535
or people get scared, maybe
she wasn't thinking clearly.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:57.830
- She wasn't scared, okay?

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.208
She just left him there, alone,

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:01.626
what kinda person does that?

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:03.878
- People panic, Katie.

01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:06.923
We don't know what was
going through her head.

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.883
- You're right, I don't know
what's going through her head,

01:13:08.927 --> 01:13:10.593
I just know that from
the minute she got here,

01:13:10.637 --> 01:13:12.762
everything's gone wild, and
that's not a coincidence.

01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:16.391
- I think that you're trying

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:18.059
to make her out
to be the bad guy

01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:19.936
'cause you never wanted her
here in the first place.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:26.609
- Wow, I never realized what
little you thought of me.

01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:29.654
- It's not that I think
little of you, Katie,

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:33.116
it's just that you don't know
what her mother was like.

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.119
She's led a rough life,

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:38.788
and this is the first time
she's ever had any real family.

01:13:38.832 --> 01:13:41.916
- Greg, she's dangerous,

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.961
to herself and to others,

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:48.423
and until you're willing to
let me get her a psyche eval,

01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:50.883
I can't have my children
in the same house as her.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:54.762
- And what if you're wrong?

01:13:56.975 --> 01:13:58.224
I've already lost Sam once,

01:13:58.268 --> 01:13:59.767
I can't lose her again
based on paranoia.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.229
I need proof.

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:10.069
(Katie scoffs)

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:16.951
- What happened? Are you okay?

01:14:16.995 --> 01:14:18.911
- Here, come on in, you got it?

01:14:24.586 --> 01:14:26.169
Lauren, where's Samantha?

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:28.880
- I don't know, I haven't
seen her since she got home.

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:30.965
- Okay, why don't you go grab
a seat on the couch, okay?

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:32.300
Will you help him?
(tense music)

01:14:32.343 --> 01:14:34.802
I'll be right back.
- What's going on?

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.306
(tense music)

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.451
- Tommy?

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:42.787
Lauren?

01:15:46.084 --> 01:15:46.874
- Mom?

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.211
- We're leaving.

01:15:50.255 --> 01:15:51.629
Help Tommy pack a bag, just one,

01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:55.007
and I'm gonna bring
the car around, okay?

01:15:57.053 --> 01:16:00.054
(Katie snaps pictures)

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:10.231
Hey, I was right,
and I have proof.

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:11.774
Don't come home, it's not safe.

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.943
I'm gonna take the kids and
go to the Sheffield Hotel,

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:15.027
just meet us there, bye.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:21.117
(pulls door handle)

01:16:25.415 --> 01:16:28.207
Samantha: You looking for these?

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.002
- Yeah.

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:33.004
Uh, I'm just gonna

01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:38.050
take the kids outta town
for a couple days and,

01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:44.890
uh, just let Tommy recuperate,

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.184
and you can have some
one-on-one time with your Dad.

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:51.814
- How stupid do you
think that I am?

01:16:52.734 --> 01:16:56.068
(intense instrumentals)

01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:16.005
(starts car)

01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:24.096
(Samantha sighs)

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.225
Ryan, hey.

01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:29.644
- Oh, hey there, Sam.

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:31.812
I heard Tommy broke his
leg, is he all right?

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:33.606
- Oh, yeah, yeah, he's fine,

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:35.066
I think he just needs some rest.

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:36.776
- And, uh, how's
Katie holding up?

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.361
Is she inside?

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.112
- Um, no, actually,

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:42.657
she just went to the store to
get a few things for Tommy.

01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:44.492
- At this hour?

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:48.579
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure she
knows where she's going.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:52.041
(Katie groans)

01:18:01.135 --> 01:18:03.219
- Kids alone inside?

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.137
- Alone? I mean, I'm here.

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:08.683
- Right.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.561
Well, if you need me...

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:14.772
- Yeah, I'll have Katie,
um, give you a call.

01:18:14.816 --> 01:18:18.109
(Katie kicks trunk)

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:21.737
(Katie kicks trunk)

01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:24.198
(Ryan screams)

01:18:37.422 --> 01:18:39.964
(Katie hits Ryan with crowbar)

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.215
(Ryan groans)

01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:43.467
- Sam, what are you doing?

01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:45.219
What are you doing?

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:58.107
(Ryan groans)

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:03.821
- Oh, my god.

01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:06.782
Tommy!

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.327
Tommy!

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:14.665
- I forgot about
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:24.592
Lauren: Tommy?

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:26.093
- What?

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:26.802
Lauren: Tommy, are you up here?

01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:28.053
- Yeah.

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:29.138
Lauren: She killed him.

01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:30.306
- Who?

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:31.766
- Samantha killed Ryan.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.225
- What?
- I don't know where Mom is,

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:34.852
but we gotta get outta here.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:36.228
(thud)

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.481
- All right, let's get out--
- Shh.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:48.699
Bathroom, we can
lock ourselves in.

01:19:48.743 --> 01:19:49.492
- Go.

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:55.247
(Katie kicks trunk)

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:14.141
(tense music)

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:22.441
(commotion)

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:27.279
(door closes)

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.364
(Lauren locks door)

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:29.156
Lauren: Okay.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.157
- What do we do?

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:31.575
- Did you call the police?

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:32.451
- Yeah, I called the cops,
they're on their way.

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:33.160
- Will they get there in time?

01:20:33.204 --> 01:20:33.953
- I hope so,

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:35.454
I mean, it was...

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:38.040
Lauren: Okay, just stay quiet.

01:20:44.924 --> 01:20:46.382
(bangs knife on door)

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:48.509
- Come out, come out
wherever you are.

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:55.850
(Samantha bangs knife on door)

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:58.602
(Samantha bangs knife on door)

01:20:58.646 --> 01:21:01.689
(Samantha jerks door handle)

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.357
- Shh.

01:21:03.401 --> 01:21:08.195
(Samantha knocks on door)
Don't say a word.

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:09.822
Shh.

01:21:09.866 --> 01:21:10.823
(Samantha jerks door handle)

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:12.867
- Huh, a door that locks itself.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.415
We can do this the easy
way or the hard way.

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:24.420
I guess the hard way.

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:30.426
(Samantha jerks door handle)

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:31.218
- Samantha,

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:35.890
put down the knife.

01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:37.933
We can work this out.

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:41.604
- There's nothing to work out.

01:21:42.982 --> 01:21:45.190
My mother kept me
from the only person

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.234
who ever cared about me,

01:21:47.278 --> 01:21:49.528
so you have to be
eliminated just like her.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.490
- I'm sorry she did that to you.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.160
You deserve better than that.

01:21:57.705 --> 01:21:59.872
We're not trying to
keep you from Greg,

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:02.791
we want you to be a
part of this family.

01:22:04.462 --> 01:22:06.921
- You don't care about me.

01:22:06.964 --> 01:22:11.467
I know that I'm messing up
your perfect little world.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.887
And you know, I used to
come here every summer,

01:22:14.931 --> 01:22:16.430
and I would watch you.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:22.561
That should've been my
life, you stole it from me.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:27.483
- Samantha, listen,
we can fix this.

01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:31.236
Greg loves you very much.

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:34.281
- I don't think you understand,

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:37.451
there's no going
forward from here.

01:22:37.495 --> 01:22:41.038
How can you, how
can anyone help me?

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:45.542
- I know this seems hard,
but you have options,

01:22:46.963 --> 01:22:48.879
and we'll be with
you the whole way.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:57.429
- Why would you help me after
everything that I've done?

01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:58.389
- We're family,

01:22:59.642 --> 01:23:00.391
you belong here.

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.311
Just put the knife down.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:12.236
You're family, Samantha.

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:13.070
Okay?

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:17.157
Just give me the knife.

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:22.329
(Samantha stabs Katie)

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:27.251
(Katie struggles to breathe)

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.011
- Samantha, what are you doing?

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.181
- Oh, I'm doing this for you.

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:44.727
- Samantha, no, you
have to stop this.

01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:46.979
- You're taking her side?

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:49.648
I'm your daughter.

01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:52.609
(sirens wail)

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:54.445
You called the cops on me?

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:57.072
- Honey...

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:58.365
- Don't honey me.

01:23:59.744 --> 01:24:01.118
You betrayed me.

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.747
(glass shatters)

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:13.505
- I'm so sorry.

01:24:15.426 --> 01:24:16.508
I'm so sorry.

01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:18.552
- It's okay.

01:24:23.476 --> 01:24:24.850
- Are you okay?

01:24:24.894 --> 01:24:29.813
Are you okay?
(soft music)

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:38.363
- What?

01:24:39.784 --> 01:24:42.868
- I'm just thinking
about how lucky I am

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:45.204
to have a wife
that's so wonderful,

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.457
and forgiving, (Katie
chuckles) and beautiful.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:50.375
- Go on.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:53.253
- And smart.

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:54.797
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.673
- And kind.

01:24:56.717 --> 01:24:58.842
And the bravest person I know.

01:25:01.347 --> 01:25:02.846
And way out of my league.

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.473
- Well, that's for sure.

01:25:04.517 --> 01:25:07.434
(Katie chuckles)

01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:15.901
(tense music)
