01:39.481 --> 01:40.979
Goodbye with their families

01:40.981 --> 01:43.351
before leaving for a
strange and distance shore.

01:44.952 --> 01:47.554
At this very moment,
they serve together

01:47.556 --> 01:52.325
with Arabs, Europeans,
Asians and Africans

01:52.327 --> 01:56.398
in defense of principle and
the dream of a new world order.

01:58.098 --> 02:00.432
And that's why they sweat
and toil in the sand

02:00.434 --> 02:01.502
and the heat and the sun.

02:03.205 --> 02:06.271
And if they can come together
under such adversity,

02:08.076 --> 02:10.043
if old adversaries
like the Soviet Union

02:10.044 --> 02:12.878
and the United States
can work in common cause

02:12.880 --> 02:15.517
then surely we,

02:17.117 --> 02:19.921
who are so fortunate to
be in this great chamber,

02:21.223 --> 02:25.091
democrats, republicans,
liberals, conservatives,

02:25.093 --> 02:29.031
can come together to fulfill
our responsibilities here.

02:30.297 --> 02:32.134
There is something
noble and majestic

02:33.267 --> 02:36.102
about the pride,
about the patriotism

02:36.104 --> 02:37.406
that we feel tonight.

02:40.307 --> 02:42.510
So to everyone here,
everyone watching at home,

02:43.879 --> 02:46.079
think about the men and
women of Desert Storm.

02:46.081 --> 02:49.549
Let us honor them
with our gratitude.

02:49.551 --> 02:51.320
Thank you, goodnight,

02:52.653 --> 02:57.055
and God bless the United
States of America.

02:57.057 --> 02:57.859
Yeah?

03:11.438 --> 03:12.273
I don't,

03:14.075 --> 03:15.044
yeah, it's hard to say.

03:16.143 --> 03:18.948
It's just, you know.

03:21.049 --> 03:22.250
Today was Ray's birthday.

03:27.488 --> 03:31.093
I don't know about that,
I can't, not today.

03:39.067 --> 03:42.200
There's probably no more time.

03:42.202 --> 03:45.074
I don't need to do this anymore.

03:48.075 --> 03:49.574
I don't know.

03:49.576 --> 03:50.445
I'm sorry.

03:51.379 --> 03:52.548
I have to go.

03:59.354 --> 04:00.422
I'm crystal and exact.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.460
I have no preconceptions.

04:09.129 --> 04:11.532
Illusions fed, lo and behold.

04:13.301 --> 04:15.004
My mind is free forever.

04:17.103 --> 04:20.274
I burn with fire and
ice and then I melt.

04:25.679 --> 04:27.415
My thoughts in dire reflection.

04:30.118 --> 04:32.187
But more than anything I know,

04:34.121 --> 04:36.291
the moment's final terror.

05:48.229 --> 05:50.366
The doctor'll be right in.

05:55.236 --> 05:56.305
Could be fun.

06:00.407 --> 06:01.210
John?

06:03.477 --> 06:04.278
Yes, Sam.

06:06.815 --> 06:07.750
What's happening?

06:10.649 --> 06:11.252
Everything's fine,
you're safe now.

06:12.753 --> 06:14.152
Where am I?

06:14.154 --> 06:15.487
What's that smell?

06:15.489 --> 06:17.158
You don't remember anything?

06:20.727 --> 06:22.395
Why are you here?

06:22.397 --> 06:24.196
You're not my doctor anymore.

06:24.198 --> 06:26.534
I'm your friend
and you need help.

06:28.669 --> 06:30.338
I don't need anything.

06:42.549 --> 06:44.318
That evening when I called.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.356
Ray.

06:49.190 --> 06:51.289
It was my brother's birthday.

06:51.291 --> 06:52.193
Good, you remember.

06:54.428 --> 06:57.330
I know how much your
brother meant to you.

06:57.332 --> 06:58.332
You were close.

07:00.534 --> 07:01.335
No.

07:03.505 --> 07:04.440
But I wish we were.

07:08.243 --> 07:10.379
Why did you leave my care?

07:11.645 --> 07:12.811
I could have helped you.

07:12.813 --> 07:15.383
We were making
such good progress.

07:20.822 --> 07:22.391
You call this progress?

07:23.625 --> 07:24.760
We call it life, Sam.

07:26.361 --> 07:28.330
A precious gift which you
threw out of a window.

07:44.479 --> 07:47.412
I feel like I haven't
seen you in years.

07:47.414 --> 07:48.549
It hasn't been that long.

07:49.616 --> 07:52.153
You haven't changed a bit.

07:54.354 --> 07:55.390
We'll get through this.

07:56.323 --> 07:58.526
You get a second chance.

08:12.407 --> 08:14.443
They asked me to take
you back under my care.

08:15.743 --> 08:16.577
I said yes.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.323
Sam.

09:08.529 --> 09:09.364
Here.

09:16.938 --> 09:19.437
How are you feeling?

09:19.439 --> 09:20.739
How do you think?

09:20.741 --> 09:22.443
This place is suffocating.

09:23.477 --> 09:24.679
I have some good news.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.681
I spoke with Irving
and we made a deal.

09:28.683 --> 09:31.517
As long as we continue
our treatment together,

09:31.519 --> 09:33.286
you can go back to work.

09:33.288 --> 09:35.654
Took a little bit
of convincing, but,

09:38.992 --> 09:41.527
you are their best engineer.

09:41.529 --> 09:44.332
I told him you need
a couple more weeks.

11:11.119 --> 11:12.585
Star Force with
no relay protection

11:12.587 --> 11:14.552
on grounds whiskey.

11:14.554 --> 11:16.021
They gonna light
themselves up every time.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.422
Well maybe they like it.

11:17.424 --> 11:18.623
The fireworks stuff.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.091
Oh yeah.

11:20.093 --> 11:21.494
And I'm sure the
investors just love

11:21.496 --> 11:23.128
dishing out a quarter
mill every year.

11:23.130 --> 11:24.629
Idiots.

11:24.631 --> 11:26.165
So what?

11:26.167 --> 11:28.600
More work for us,
that's the way I see it.

11:28.602 --> 11:30.902
Who cares how many
times they black out?

11:30.904 --> 11:32.874
As long as they call
us for replacements.

11:34.074 --> 11:35.673
Whatever, man.

11:35.675 --> 11:37.945
They can blow themselves
to shit for all I care.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.692
Take over.

11:54.694 --> 11:55.527
Zack.

11:55.529 --> 11:56.729
Hey, screw it.

11:56.731 --> 11:58.630
They don't even have a
quarter of the market.

11:58.632 --> 11:59.233
Sam.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.439
Mr. Irving wants to see you.

12:07.475 --> 12:08.574
Who?

12:08.576 --> 12:09.945
Speaking of blow, look.

12:13.981 --> 12:16.080
Hey, Miller.

12:16.082 --> 12:17.818
Nice of you to join
us from time to time.

12:21.154 --> 12:22.521
Hey, what's up with you, man?

12:22.523 --> 12:24.223
Switch up the juice
today or what?

12:26.928 --> 12:28.627
Let the man trip in peace.

12:28.629 --> 12:31.464
Poor bastard might be
crying, look at him.

12:36.703 --> 12:37.606
Hey, chill!

12:40.207 --> 12:42.577
I said calm the fuck down!

12:43.577 --> 12:44.509
What the fuck, crackhead,

12:44.511 --> 12:45.911
you ready to hit me or what?

12:45.913 --> 12:46.912
What the fuck?

12:46.914 --> 12:47.879
Everybody just
chill and relax.

12:47.881 --> 12:49.681
All right, just stop.

12:49.683 --> 12:50.782
Let him go.

12:50.784 --> 12:52.587
Gills, let him go.

12:55.523 --> 12:56.892
Damn lunatic.

12:59.226 --> 13:00.761
The hell's going on here?

13:01.895 --> 13:04.763
Jesus, Sam, you okay?

13:04.765 --> 13:07.932
Come on, you okay, huh?

13:07.934 --> 13:11.269
Come on, get up, get up.

13:11.271 --> 13:13.538
Get up, come on, come on.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.608
Get down to my office.

13:15.610 --> 13:17.509
The hell's wrong with you guys?

13:17.511 --> 13:18.811
Hey, he came at us.

13:18.813 --> 13:20.812
He's losing it, boss.

13:59.553 --> 14:00.786
Sam!

14:00.788 --> 14:02.854
What are you doing?

14:02.856 --> 14:04.192
You'll get pneumonia that way!

14:06.861 --> 14:08.661
I got your message.

14:08.663 --> 14:10.532
And I spoke with Irving.

14:11.265 --> 14:12.634
I'm sorry.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.037
Come on.

14:17.704 --> 14:18.772
Let's get you inside.

14:28.783 --> 14:30.181
Talk to me, Sam.

14:30.183 --> 14:32.017
There's nothing to say.

14:32.019 --> 14:35.720
Okay, well then we'll
forget about it, okay?

14:35.722 --> 14:38.659
Frankly, I'm glad
this happened, I am.

14:39.693 --> 14:41.926
This'll give you a
chance to reboot.

14:41.928 --> 14:43.295
A fresh start.

14:43.297 --> 14:45.797
There's no more time, John.

14:45.799 --> 14:49.100
No more second
chances, no restart.

14:49.102 --> 14:52.003
That's not what I meant.

14:52.005 --> 14:55.840
The symptoms won't go away
until we find the cause.

14:55.842 --> 14:57.343
Cause?

14:57.345 --> 15:00.678
What cause, there's no cause.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.614
It's just me!

15:01.616 --> 15:04.649
There is always a cause, Sam.

15:04.651 --> 15:06.884
We just need a
different approach.

15:06.886 --> 15:10.623
And I have found
exactly what we need.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.391
What are you talking about?

15:12.393 --> 15:15.793
A new treatment called
affective plating.

15:15.795 --> 15:17.896
A multistep program that deals

15:17.898 --> 15:20.165
with the neurochemistry
of emotions.

15:20.167 --> 15:23.201
A cognitive harmonization
if you will,

15:23.203 --> 15:25.403
completely non-invasive.

15:25.405 --> 15:28.072
These guys are
ahead of their time.

15:28.074 --> 15:31.844
I'm glad you're
finding this so exciting.

15:31.846 --> 15:34.582
It's not for me, I'll pass.

15:35.750 --> 15:39.051
Besides, it's not like
I can afford it anyway!

15:39.053 --> 15:42.086
No, Sam, this one's on me.

15:42.088 --> 15:44.255
I am doing studies
for the patent holders

15:44.257 --> 15:47.725
and they have agreed
to cover your sessions.

15:47.727 --> 15:49.930
You won't have to spend a dime.

15:50.997 --> 15:52.800
Why are you doing this for me?

15:54.834 --> 15:57.037
Let's just say that
it's not just for you.

15:58.139 --> 15:59.106
It's for me too.

16:00.808 --> 16:02.811
I can't let myself fail you.

16:03.778 --> 16:04.779
Not again.

16:10.784 --> 16:12.053
You didn't fail me, John.

16:14.922 --> 16:16.257
I failed myself.

16:19.393 --> 16:20.928
And the question is, Sam,

16:22.196 --> 16:24.099
what are you gonna do about it?

17:05.171 --> 17:05.805
Hello?

17:08.374 --> 17:10.876
May I help you with something?

17:10.877 --> 17:14.012
I'm here
to see Dr. Nash.

17:14.013 --> 17:14.848
Your name?

17:20.153 --> 17:22.423
That elevator, sub level D.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.186
Hello?

18:31.257 --> 18:33.492
Sam Miller, right?

18:33.494 --> 18:35.092
That's right.

18:35.094 --> 18:36.430
We've been expecting you.

18:51.611 --> 18:53.113
Please, help yourself.

19:00.420 --> 19:03.888
I'm Dr. Nash, Roland Nash.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.127
Nice place.

19:10.030 --> 19:11.232
What kind of doctor are you?

19:12.233 --> 19:13.234
Affective Science.

19:15.034 --> 19:17.002
Never heard of it.

19:17.004 --> 19:18.005
The study of emotions.

19:19.372 --> 19:20.973
Well, the underlying
neuroscience of emotions,

19:20.975 --> 19:21.810
to be exact.

19:22.942 --> 19:24.309
Sounds involved.

19:24.311 --> 19:25.146
It is.

19:26.613 --> 19:28.882
You came to the right place
at the right time, Mr. Miller.

19:31.051 --> 19:32.253
What's with all the water?

19:34.921 --> 19:35.556
Memory.

19:37.157 --> 19:39.992
We used ionized water
for storage and access.

19:39.994 --> 19:43.294
There's no way to disseminate
so much data without it.

19:43.296 --> 19:45.199
Data, what kind of data?

19:46.400 --> 19:48.436
We'll get to that
in a bit, Mr. Miller.

19:50.036 --> 19:51.005
Please have a seat.

20:10.591 --> 20:12.861
So, when do we start?

20:13.928 --> 20:14.862
We already have.

20:19.332 --> 20:20.235
How do you mean?

20:21.601 --> 20:23.036
Water, Mr. Miller.

20:25.339 --> 20:27.571
Aside from it's obvious
refreshing qualities,

20:27.573 --> 20:30.044
it has one other
function, imprinting.

20:32.146 --> 20:34.249
It's pure
water, nothing more.

20:35.315 --> 20:37.182
Its molecular structure changes

20:37.184 --> 20:38.353
as it enters your body.

20:39.553 --> 20:41.485
The water copies and
stores everything

20:41.487 --> 20:44.089
that you're going through at
the highest degree of accuracy.

20:44.091 --> 20:46.159
The world's most
advanced memory chip.

20:47.695 --> 20:52.066
We're able to access and
read that imprint with this.

20:55.335 --> 20:57.234
What's that?

20:57.236 --> 21:00.240
This is our magic
wand, Mr. Miller.

21:01.408 --> 21:03.675
A controlled affective
plating unit,

21:03.677 --> 21:06.246
or simply CAP.

21:10.684 --> 21:13.385
The visor emits harmless
photons that interact

21:13.387 --> 21:15.087
directly with your
visual cortex.

21:15.089 --> 21:18.322
Your nervous system reacts by
creating an emotional response

21:18.324 --> 21:21.292
that we can immediately
capture and analyze.

21:21.294 --> 21:24.663
The point is to have
a complete topography

21:24.665 --> 21:25.898
of your perceptive range.

21:25.900 --> 21:29.102
It'll give us an eagle eye view
of your emotional spectrum.

21:32.105 --> 21:33.140
May I?

21:34.307 --> 21:35.142
Yeah.

21:37.276 --> 21:38.642
To treat something,
we first must have

21:38.644 --> 21:40.480
a clear picture of what
we're dealing with, right?

21:42.248 --> 21:43.150
Whatever you say, Doc.

21:57.130 --> 21:59.132
Here you are, Mr. Miller.

22:04.537 --> 22:05.372
Perfect.

22:09.275 --> 22:11.611
Please try to keep still

22:12.579 --> 22:13.581
and your eyes open.

22:23.290 --> 22:24.488
Here we go.

23:27.888 --> 23:28.790
Pheromones?

23:34.361 --> 23:36.363
What in the world
happened to you?

23:40.900 --> 23:42.533
What?

23:42.535 --> 23:44.705
You don't remember, do you?

24:01.255 --> 24:02.323
You have to regroup.

24:03.823 --> 24:05.192
Bend yourself.

24:13.432 --> 24:14.501
Mr. Miller.

24:16.536 --> 24:18.139
Mr. Miller, can you hear me?

24:23.342 --> 24:24.178
How do you feel?

24:26.813 --> 24:29.347
I'm not sure.

24:29.349 --> 24:31.715
Any discomfort or
other sensations?

24:31.717 --> 24:36.657
I think it was a feeling
of weightlessness or flying.

24:38.559 --> 24:40.328
I felt light, very light.

24:42.528 --> 24:44.862
There's a tingling
sensation in my hands.

24:44.864 --> 24:46.199
That's normal.

24:47.301 --> 24:48.336
Anything else?

24:51.638 --> 24:52.473
I saw something.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.476
Yes, your brain was
emulating the visual input.

24:57.511 --> 24:59.211
No, no, no, it
was more than that.

24:59.213 --> 25:02.917
It was like a memory or deja vu.

25:04.450 --> 25:06.484
Something very familiar.

25:06.486 --> 25:08.488
A lifetime in a split second?

25:11.457 --> 25:12.493
Yeah.

25:13.627 --> 25:16.427
Or something like that.

25:16.429 --> 25:18.332
I did pick up
something interesting.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.332
Interesting?

25:21.334 --> 25:22.169
Yes.

25:24.737 --> 25:26.373
High synaptic elasticity.

25:27.740 --> 25:29.407
Huh?

25:29.409 --> 25:31.443
In other words,
your nervous system

25:31.445 --> 25:33.844
is extremely reactive.

25:33.846 --> 25:35.413
Hypersensitive, actually.

25:35.415 --> 25:37.514
A small amount of
stimuli leads to

25:37.516 --> 25:39.687
a massive neuro response.

25:40.853 --> 25:43.490
I've never seen
anything like it.

25:52.332 --> 25:53.465
Dr. Loro.

25:53.467 --> 25:54.368
Dr. Nash.

25:56.436 --> 25:57.237
Mr. Miller.

25:59.805 --> 26:01.508
Julian Loro, this
is my facility.

26:06.013 --> 26:08.312
I've been monitoring your
session and I have to agree

26:08.314 --> 26:09.382
with Dr. Nash.

26:10.751 --> 26:15.320
Your neurological
profile is quite rare,

26:15.322 --> 26:16.424
quite rare indeed.

26:17.423 --> 26:19.226
Too bad I can't sell it, huh?

26:21.027 --> 26:23.496
No, you can't sell it
but you can shape it.

26:24.898 --> 26:26.531
Tell me about it.

26:26.533 --> 26:28.535
I've been shaping it for years.

26:31.405 --> 26:32.540
Let me see those.

26:36.543 --> 26:38.012
You don't need
these, Mr. Miller.

26:39.912 --> 26:42.313
Your emotions are the key.

26:42.315 --> 26:44.081
They're a biproduct of
your neurochemical codex,

26:44.083 --> 26:46.821
a codex that can be
resequenced, controlled.

26:48.487 --> 26:49.321
Controlled?

26:49.323 --> 26:49.957
By what?

26:50.857 --> 26:51.692
Ah.

26:52.758 --> 26:53.593
Dr. Nash.

26:55.795 --> 26:58.763
Your mind's a
magnificent construct.

26:58.765 --> 27:00.598
Its potential is actually beyond

27:00.600 --> 27:02.867
its own ability to comprehend.

27:02.869 --> 27:04.938
It's magnificent.

27:15.482 --> 27:16.580
Round two?

27:16.582 --> 27:17.584
You'll enjoy this.

27:18.552 --> 27:19.587
Trust me.

27:20.853 --> 27:22.087
We cannot change
your mind, Mr. Miller

27:22.089 --> 27:23.624
but we can change your mood.

27:27.060 --> 27:27.995
For example.

27:29.996 --> 27:30.898
Take your pick.

27:33.800 --> 27:34.869
Is this some kind of a joke?

27:35.736 --> 27:38.403
Well, let me do that for you.

27:38.405 --> 27:40.675
How about elation?

27:42.676 --> 27:45.944
The feeling you get when
you embrace and kiss

27:45.946 --> 27:47.415
someone you care about.

27:49.483 --> 27:54.488
Tranquility, that feeling of
warm sunshine on your face.

27:57.990 --> 28:01.559
And grace, a state
of pure grace,

28:01.561 --> 28:02.730
would you like to feel that?

28:03.897 --> 28:05.433
Yeah, I would.

28:07.633 --> 28:08.468
Dr. Nash.

28:10.169 --> 28:11.371
Yes, sir.

28:17.410 --> 28:18.576
What's with him?

28:18.578 --> 28:19.680
Oh, Dr. Loro?

28:20.880 --> 28:21.948
He's all right, just,

28:23.483 --> 28:24.585
a bit into his work.

28:26.486 --> 28:27.688
I'll say.

28:31.525 --> 28:35.859
This is going to feel
a little different.

28:35.861 --> 28:37.797
The interval is much
shorter this time.

28:45.805 --> 28:47.707
I'll be counting 10 seconds.

28:54.948 --> 28:56.784
10, nine, eight, seven

29:02.088 --> 29:02.923
five.

29:05.592 --> 29:06.627
11.

29:10.464 --> 29:11.098
Two.

29:11.997 --> 29:12.832
One.

29:26.612 --> 29:27.448
Well?

29:28.681 --> 29:29.749
How do you feel, Sam?

29:40.092 --> 29:41.562
It's something, isn't it?

29:54.774 --> 29:57.742
I think I'd like
to go now, Dr. Nash.

29:57.744 --> 29:58.846
Of course, Mr. Miller.

30:01.948 --> 30:03.684
I'm sure we'll see
each other soon.

31:55.894 --> 31:57.964
It's a beautiful
day, isn't it, brother?

31:59.765 --> 32:01.866
It's always a beautiful
day for you, Ray.

32:01.868 --> 32:03.400
You're just like mom.

32:03.402 --> 32:04.804
It can't be any other way.

32:05.971 --> 32:08.339
There's nothing that
can bring us down.

32:08.341 --> 32:09.176
Remember that.

32:12.778 --> 32:13.948
Watch your six out there.

32:14.913 --> 32:16.781
Affirmative.

32:16.783 --> 32:18.284
You, I'll see you
when I get back.

32:41.908 --> 32:44.708
Remember what
she used to tell us?

32:44.710 --> 32:47.714
I feel, therefore I am.

32:50.382 --> 32:51.784
Stay true, brother.

33:03.697 --> 33:04.765
Pheromones?

33:45.371 --> 33:47.775
You get several neural
pathways like this.

33:49.042 --> 33:51.311
The hell do you
think you were doing?

33:52.211 --> 33:53.046
What does it look like?

33:58.985 --> 34:01.255
What's the status on
the application strands?

34:02.121 --> 34:03.823
I'm going as fast as I can.

34:04.957 --> 34:06.924
We're down to the last quadrant.

34:06.926 --> 34:08.896
There is no last quadrant!

34:09.862 --> 34:11.764
The range is boundless.

34:13.032 --> 34:15.899
We don't have time for these
inter-trade permutations.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.001
I thought I made that
clear the last time.

34:18.003 --> 34:19.272
Yes, but sir.

34:21.507 --> 34:22.342
Patient Miller.

34:24.110 --> 34:25.909
He's different.

34:25.911 --> 34:27.879
There were delta
waves during the draw.

34:27.880 --> 34:28.945
I believe we found a...

34:28.947 --> 34:30.983
I don't care what you believe.

34:31.985 --> 34:33.120
I just want you to
do as you're told.

34:34.920 --> 34:36.454
Yes sir.

34:36.456 --> 34:38.021
They're sending a review
team down here next week.

34:38.023 --> 34:39.389
And these goons
don't give a shit

34:39.391 --> 34:41.128
about anything
except applications.

34:46.331 --> 34:50.335
They don't negotiate,
they just don't negotiate.

34:53.005 --> 34:54.975
With all due
respect, Dr. Loro.

34:56.041 --> 34:57.410
We don't even have the map yet.

35:03.916 --> 35:08.019
I don't give a shit
if you use chipmunks.

35:08.021 --> 35:09.490
You get me that application.

35:11.490 --> 35:12.959
Have I made myself clear?

35:14.260 --> 35:15.392
Yes sir.

35:15.394 --> 35:16.195
Have I?

35:18.164 --> 35:19.499
Yes, you have.

36:17.189 --> 36:19.055
Fucking junkie.

36:19.057 --> 36:21.091
Look at this piece of shit.

36:21.093 --> 36:22.496
I can't believe this.

37:10.175 --> 37:12.075
Are you really gonna let
this garbage in here?

37:12.077 --> 37:14.044
Get him out of here!

37:19.318 --> 37:22.218
Sam, listen, you need to bend.

37:22.220 --> 37:23.055
Come on.

37:27.093 --> 37:28.128
Get in.

38:20.613 --> 38:21.448
John?

38:26.352 --> 38:27.688
What's going on?

38:29.354 --> 38:30.423
What are we doing here?

38:33.191 --> 38:34.394
Saving your life, Sam.

38:36.061 --> 38:37.197
Good morning, Mr. Miller.

38:39.264 --> 38:40.530
Morning?

38:40.532 --> 38:41.367
Yes.

38:42.568 --> 38:45.169
You passed out on the
way here last night.

38:45.171 --> 38:46.673
You've been asleep ever since.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.209
Can you tell us where you've
been the last four days?

38:52.278 --> 38:53.244
What?

38:53.246 --> 38:55.182
We've been trying
to find you all week.

38:56.282 --> 38:57.316
I called.

38:58.251 --> 38:59.216
I stopped by your
apartment several times,

38:59.218 --> 39:00.086
you didn't answer.

39:03.189 --> 39:05.359
Do you remember what
you did all this time?

39:07.126 --> 39:08.392
No.

39:08.394 --> 39:11.062
Mr. Miller, it's
important that you under...

39:11.064 --> 39:13.329
Who was that other
guy that was here?

39:13.331 --> 39:15.198
I've seen him before.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.734
He's been following
me, hasn't he?

39:17.736 --> 39:19.202
I don't know what you mean.

39:19.204 --> 39:21.238
This spooky guy
with the shades.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.340
The guy who drove us last night.

39:23.342 --> 39:24.744
I drove us here, Sam.

39:25.778 --> 39:28.015
Nobody else was in the car.

39:32.218 --> 39:33.350
Why did you bring me here?

39:33.352 --> 39:35.119
The treatment, Sam.

39:35.121 --> 39:37.120
It must have continuity.

39:37.122 --> 39:39.756
Large gaps between the sessions
will lead to regression,

39:39.758 --> 39:43.394
paranoia, hallucinations.

39:43.396 --> 39:44.727
It's only the beginning.

39:44.729 --> 39:46.265
This could get a lot worse.

39:47.467 --> 39:50.403
You need to regain
control, Sam, bend yourself.

39:52.204 --> 39:53.472
You have to trust us.

40:04.249 --> 40:06.052
So what's on the menu today?

40:07.220 --> 40:08.588
Well we do have
a special today.

40:10.889 --> 40:11.724
It's the new you.

40:14.260 --> 40:15.294
Right.

40:20.499 --> 40:22.268
Lifetime in a split second?

40:24.736 --> 40:25.539
You got it.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.255
Ready?

42:35.934 --> 42:38.535
Did I not make
myself clear, Nash?

42:38.537 --> 42:40.372
He's been under
only a few seconds.

42:41.907 --> 42:43.740
We're not gonna find
anything at these levels.

42:43.742 --> 42:45.575
We have to set a new threshold.

42:45.577 --> 42:47.544
Sir, he's already
scraping the bottom.

42:47.546 --> 42:48.778
Who says that's the bottom?

42:48.780 --> 42:51.481
His endocrine system
is almost out of phase.

42:51.483 --> 42:54.017
Are you sure this is a
prudent move, Julian?

42:54.019 --> 42:56.387
Prudence has nothing
to do with this, John.

42:56.389 --> 42:57.923
Wait, Dr. Loro.

42:59.392 --> 43:00.393
You need to see this.

43:07.599 --> 43:10.867
Look, that first cap
registered a strong delta.

43:10.869 --> 43:12.936
Now this is odd because
deltas appear only

43:12.938 --> 43:14.972
when unconscious or
during deep sleep.

43:14.974 --> 43:16.673
Sam was neither.

43:16.675 --> 43:19.778
Then, I saw this.

43:24.416 --> 43:25.548
What the hell is that?

43:25.550 --> 43:27.450
The cap couldn't
identify it either.

43:27.452 --> 43:29.586
370 Megahertz in amplitude.

43:29.588 --> 43:32.088
We're talking a radio
reach of at least 30 feet.

43:32.090 --> 43:34.490
I ran it by our external
and got a match.

43:34.492 --> 43:36.295
A primer class pheromone.

43:37.595 --> 43:38.662
Maybe.

43:38.664 --> 43:41.497
He's emitting
behavioral hormones.

43:41.499 --> 43:42.466
Correct.

43:42.468 --> 43:43.770
Airborne hormones.

43:46.572 --> 43:49.573
And you guys
were gonna tell me this when?

43:49.575 --> 43:51.608
I tried telling you.

43:51.610 --> 43:52.975
This is exactly what
we've been looking for.

43:52.977 --> 43:54.581
ID the source, now.

44:25.910 --> 44:28.010
We need to pull him out,
his blood pressure's spiking.

44:28.012 --> 44:28.945
Not yet.

44:28.947 --> 44:30.414
He'll go into cardiac arrest!

44:30.416 --> 44:31.017
Julian!

44:32.151 --> 44:34.117
Look,
look look, whatever.

44:34.119 --> 44:35.486
You're killing him,
can't you see that?

44:35.488 --> 44:37.553
Will you shut up?

44:37.555 --> 44:38.821
If you can't handle
this, get out!

44:38.823 --> 44:40.659
He won't be much
use if he's dead.

44:42.927 --> 44:44.561
There!

44:44.563 --> 44:46.633
There's your new threshold.

45:11.189 --> 45:12.588
He's cold.

45:12.590 --> 45:13.689
You
almost killed him!

45:13.691 --> 45:14.827
You watch your mouth.

45:26.771 --> 45:27.773
We found it.

45:33.211 --> 45:34.046
Mr. Miller?

45:35.914 --> 45:36.749
Look at me.

45:39.017 --> 45:40.617
Are you okay?

45:40.619 --> 45:41.454
Yes.

45:50.528 --> 45:52.528
How do you feel?

45:52.530 --> 45:53.565
I don't know.

45:54.767 --> 45:56.703
Are we finished with
the session, doctor?

45:58.903 --> 46:00.706
Yes, sure, but
first we need to,

46:01.807 --> 46:02.642
Mr. Miller?

46:04.642 --> 46:05.677
Let him go.

46:07.579 --> 46:08.678
Keep an eye on him.

46:08.680 --> 46:09.715
Yeah.

46:10.715 --> 46:11.717
We're on the move.

46:13.718 --> 46:14.586
Get me five.

46:17.021 --> 46:18.888
Are you sure about this?

46:18.890 --> 46:21.191
I didn't like the
look on his face.

46:21.193 --> 46:22.792
Yeah,
just follow him.

46:22.794 --> 46:25.028
Make sure he doesn't
do anything stupid.

46:25.030 --> 46:25.865
Now go on.

50:12.191 --> 50:13.026
Dr. Loro.

50:13.892 --> 50:15.428
Yes, yes sir.

50:17.829 --> 50:20.699
The lock code is,
it's system wide, yes.

50:24.035 --> 50:25.838
No, the source code
is inaccessible.

50:29.974 --> 50:33.876
Yes sir, I'm afraid the
backup is useless for that,

50:33.878 --> 50:34.846
the program's indexing protocol.

50:38.383 --> 50:39.185
I understand.

50:41.052 --> 50:42.885
Yes sir.

50:42.887 --> 50:43.789
Hello?

50:55.032 --> 50:59.905
Piece of,

53:40.932 --> 53:43.068
Are you always so serious?

53:45.336 --> 53:46.972
What's your name?

54:20.104 --> 54:21.173
Hey, come here.

55:19.064 --> 55:22.702
Do you hear that?

55:24.035 --> 55:25.204
No, I don't.

55:32.778 --> 55:34.280
No, stop, don't.

56:12.784 --> 56:14.684
Sam, wow.

56:14.686 --> 56:16.785
I hardly recognized you.

56:16.787 --> 56:18.754
You look different.

56:18.756 --> 56:21.224
You look good.

56:21.226 --> 56:22.258
Good to see you.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.294
Sit down, sit down.

56:25.430 --> 56:26.796
How's it going?

56:26.798 --> 56:28.664
Did you find a job yet or,

56:28.666 --> 56:29.501
No.

56:30.769 --> 56:32.434
Well, how can I help you?

56:32.436 --> 56:35.838
There have been some changes
in my life, Mr. Irving.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.506
Big changes.

56:37.508 --> 56:39.242
There won't be
any more problems.

56:39.244 --> 56:41.514
No more slipups, no
misunderstandings.

56:44.249 --> 56:47.350
I'm sorry, I, I
don't think I get

56:47.352 --> 56:49.251
what you're driving at.

56:49.253 --> 56:50.322
Yes, you do.

56:51.590 --> 56:53.155
You can put me on
probationary terms if you wish

56:53.157 --> 56:55.358
but I need to be reinstated.

56:55.360 --> 56:56.829
You could do that, can't you?

56:59.597 --> 57:01.164
Look, that's not how
things are done around here

57:01.166 --> 57:02.101
and you know that.

57:03.602 --> 57:05.300
Besides, you and I both know

57:05.302 --> 57:06.702
what the other guys would think

57:06.704 --> 57:09.074
when they hear about this.

57:10.307 --> 57:12.175
It's just not gonna happen.

57:12.177 --> 57:12.908
It has to.

57:12.910 --> 57:13.813
The board listens to you.

57:14.746 --> 57:16.845
I've worked here
for eight years,

57:16.847 --> 57:19.548
more than most of the other
people in your department.

57:19.550 --> 57:22.519
I am truly sorry for
what happened to you.

57:22.521 --> 57:24.689
It's simply not going to work.

57:25.823 --> 57:27.258
The damage has
already been done.

57:28.425 --> 57:32.697
Your reputation is
really regrettable.

57:34.865 --> 57:36.168
Regrettable?

57:37.434 --> 57:38.470
Look, um,

57:40.872 --> 57:43.209
I can write you a letter
of recommendation.

57:44.376 --> 57:46.745
Anything that you
need for help, but,

57:49.847 --> 57:52.217
Now you have
something to regret.

58:16.441 --> 58:19.211
What the hell
is he doing here?

58:20.311 --> 58:21.713
What the fuck?

58:22.680 --> 58:24.414
I don't know.

58:24.416 --> 58:29.388
I guess he just slowly
sleepwalked and made it in here.

58:30.689 --> 58:33.893
Irving should have canned
his ass a long time ago.

58:35.260 --> 58:37.859
God, guy's always
given me the creeps.

58:37.861 --> 58:41.296
Didn't his brother go
wacko in Iran or something,

58:41.298 --> 58:43.566
butchered four of his
own then slit his throat?

58:43.568 --> 58:44.499
In Iraq.

58:44.501 --> 58:46.336
Yeah, whatever.

58:46.338 --> 58:48.604
Guess it runs in the family.

58:48.606 --> 58:50.907
Bunch of damn crazies.

58:50.909 --> 58:52.408
Oh, shut up, Gills.

58:52.410 --> 58:53.542
He's just a doper.

58:53.544 --> 58:56.481
Hey, hey, what
you doing here, man?

58:59.950 --> 59:02.619
You miss your meditation spot?

59:03.454 --> 59:04.489
Miller.

59:06.390 --> 59:08.358
Can we help you with something?

59:08.360 --> 59:11.630
What, you forget your
pencil or something?

59:13.398 --> 59:14.633
Maybe he's deaf now.

59:16.267 --> 59:19.537
Jesus, you really
are wired, aren't you?

01:00:20.432 --> 01:00:22.097
Was Miller in here?

01:00:22.099 --> 01:00:23.568
Did he say anything?

01:00:26.938 --> 01:00:28.506
What did he say?

01:02:35.166 --> 01:02:36.001
Honey?

01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:42.573
What's gotten into you, honey?

01:02:43.575 --> 01:02:44.874
Talk to me.

01:02:44.876 --> 01:02:45.711
Go away.

01:02:51.715 --> 01:02:53.515
What did I do?

01:02:55.653 --> 01:02:56.919
Did something happen at work?

01:02:56.921 --> 01:02:57.790
Is it work?

01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:02.124
Walter, talk to me.

01:03:02.126 --> 01:03:03.729
Leave me alone!

01:03:07.764 --> 01:03:09.700
I don't matter no more.

01:03:11.735 --> 01:03:13.104
There's something in there.

01:03:14.706 --> 01:03:16.642
I know it, I know it.

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:20.479
I can hear it.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.782
It's getting close.

01:03:40.999 --> 01:03:42.131
You Cruz?

01:03:42.133 --> 01:03:43.202
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:01.952 --> 01:04:03.151
I need it!

01:04:03.153 --> 01:04:05.690
Where's the money, sucker?

01:04:12.963 --> 01:04:14.565
Where's the shit,
where's the shit?

01:04:34.619 --> 01:04:37.088
You need to come with me, Sam.

01:04:38.756 --> 01:04:40.225
The treatment must be completed.

01:04:48.865 --> 01:04:49.700
Sam.

01:04:52.637 --> 01:04:53.539
We can still help you.

01:04:54.305 --> 01:04:55.173
You're not well.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:18.130
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:22.834
Stop, please stop.

01:05:37.048 --> 01:05:38.984
Let me out, let me out!

01:05:41.885 --> 01:05:43.220
Hold on, baby.

01:05:57.934 --> 01:05:59.769
You just have to calm down.

01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:01.169
Shh!

01:06:01.171 --> 01:06:02.773
It hears everything!

01:06:15.787 --> 01:06:17.720
What in god's
name is happening?

01:06:17.722 --> 01:06:19.954
Please let me in.

01:06:19.956 --> 01:06:21.724
Let me help you.

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.178
Let me out!

01:06:48.052 --> 01:06:51.222
Synaptic
activities can become

01:06:52.456 --> 01:06:54.058
extremely unstable.

01:07:28.258 --> 01:07:29.892
Open the door.

01:07:34.298 --> 01:07:38.533
crazy, crazy.

01:07:38.535 --> 01:07:39.738
Let me in!

01:07:41.472 --> 01:07:42.307
Jesus.

01:07:45.776 --> 01:07:47.142
911,
what's the emergency?

01:07:47.144 --> 01:07:47.978
Hello?

01:07:48.979 --> 01:07:49.981
I need help.

01:07:51.081 --> 01:07:53.350
My husband, he's very sick.

01:07:56.787 --> 01:07:57.952
I don't know, he just.

01:07:57.954 --> 01:08:01.058
I'm afraid he's
gonna hurt himself.

01:09:12.129 --> 01:09:14.029
Work, work.

01:09:14.031 --> 01:09:17.402
Come on, fuck, work.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.242
Come on, come on.

01:09:48.165 --> 01:09:49.234
Ah, ah, work!

01:10:07.285 --> 01:10:09.118
Ah,

01:10:44.088 --> 01:10:45.253
Hold on,
whatever's going on,

01:10:45.255 --> 01:10:47.925
just please, please let me in.

01:10:50.728 --> 01:10:52.293
Just hang on baby,
they're coming.

01:10:52.295 --> 01:10:53.231
They're coming right now.

01:10:56.067 --> 01:10:58.100
Oh my god baby,
what's happening?

01:10:58.102 --> 01:10:59.571
Please, let me in.

01:11:00.972 --> 01:11:02.206
Let me help you.

01:11:14.451 --> 01:11:16.120
Open the door, baby.

01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.991
I'm sorry.

01:13:54.777 --> 01:13:57.414
A lot of strange things have
been happening around here.

01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:01.283
Local PD are standing
on their heads

01:14:01.285 --> 01:14:03.351
trying to figure it out.

01:14:03.353 --> 01:14:06.557
All the same though,
very impressive.

01:14:09.425 --> 01:14:10.361
What do you want?

01:14:11.528 --> 01:14:12.397
What do I want?

01:14:13.531 --> 01:14:14.365
Well.

01:14:15.765 --> 01:14:18.603
Did you think you could
actually just wander around

01:14:19.803 --> 01:14:22.407
randomly killing people, hmm?

01:14:23.339 --> 01:14:24.907
The only reason why
there isn't a SWAT team

01:14:24.909 --> 01:14:27.609
standing on your chest
right now is because of me.

01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:29.481
You are my property now, Sam.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.213
I don't want you to
have any illusion

01:14:32.215 --> 01:14:33.684
as to who's in control here.

01:14:35.186 --> 01:14:36.854
Are you sure about
that, Dr. Loro?

01:14:38.621 --> 01:14:42.427
Ah, you know the good Dr.
Nash took quite a liking to you.

01:14:44.228 --> 01:14:45.226
He seemed to think you
were some kind of prodigy,

01:14:45.228 --> 01:14:48.529
that you had the key to
hidden emotional scapes.

01:14:48.531 --> 01:14:49.730
Well I don't
believe any of that.

01:14:49.732 --> 01:14:51.468
I believe in technology.

01:14:53.237 --> 01:14:53.968
You see reality is nothing more

01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:55.537
than a reflection of our minds.

01:14:55.539 --> 01:14:58.843
Me, all I did was
build a better mirror.

01:15:00.544 --> 01:15:05.483
Everything you are,
everything you feel

01:15:06.416 --> 01:15:06.851
is because of me.

01:15:07.985 --> 01:15:08.820
Is that right?

01:15:09.753 --> 01:15:10.588
Oh that's right.

01:15:11.955 --> 01:15:13.888
You know, you're not
gonna last long out here.

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:15.527
One phone call from me and,

01:15:23.968 --> 01:15:25.467
come on.

01:15:25.469 --> 01:15:26.371
Come back with me.

01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:29.503
Without me, you're
as good as dead.

01:15:29.505 --> 01:15:30.642
It's the only way.

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:33.912
There's another way.

01:15:36.312 --> 01:15:37.378
You can get the
hell out of my sight

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.549
while you still have a chance.

01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:48.393
Your brother was so
much more compliant.

01:15:50.827 --> 01:15:52.261
What did you say?

01:15:52.263 --> 01:15:53.595
What you think your
choice for this program

01:15:53.597 --> 01:15:54.965
was totally random?

01:15:56.332 --> 01:15:57.902
Huh, you're that gullible?

01:16:00.036 --> 01:16:01.602
Your brother Ray
was one of my first

01:16:01.604 --> 01:16:04.275
battlefield applications,
one of my favorite.

01:16:05.976 --> 01:16:08.446
I mean this guy could
endure just about anything.

01:16:10.481 --> 01:16:12.381
I own you.

01:16:12.383 --> 01:16:15.720
Same way as I own that halfwit
compliant brother of yours.

01:16:26.496 --> 01:16:27.664
Sam.

01:18:20.544 --> 01:18:23.611
Go ahead, struggle, go on.

01:18:23.613 --> 01:18:25.683
The more you struggle, the
tighter it's gonna get.

01:18:27.584 --> 01:18:29.184
You know, our little
episode down there

01:18:29.186 --> 01:18:30.554
by the water's edge.

01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:36.658
Huh, you crossed a very,
very distinct line.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.796
A line that there's
no coming back from.

01:18:45.536 --> 01:18:47.535
Oh yeah, go ahead, try.

01:18:47.537 --> 01:18:48.372
Come on.

01:18:50.674 --> 01:18:53.708
Your little mind games
aren't gonna work in here.

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:55.747
My lab, my rules.

01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:03.584
You know,

01:19:03.586 --> 01:19:06.424
you have no idea
what's at stake here.

01:19:09.692 --> 01:19:12.796
You just happen to
be the last piece

01:19:14.598 --> 01:19:15.433
in a puzzle.

01:19:20.571 --> 01:19:22.607
A very complex puzzle.

01:19:25.741 --> 01:19:27.074
And I'm about to plug you in.

01:22:07.137 --> 01:22:09.072
Well, well, well,
look who's back.

01:22:11.741 --> 01:22:14.809
I would have thought you'd be
a vegetable by now, Dr. Nash.

01:22:14.811 --> 01:22:16.714
What an unpleasant surprise.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.980
You realize how
many years of work

01:22:19.982 --> 01:22:24.087
you would have cost me if it
wasn't for freak boy here, huh?

01:22:24.955 --> 01:22:26.924
What are you doing to him?

01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:29.958
What am I doing to him?

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.330
I'm doing what should
have been done but wasn't.

01:22:33.729 --> 01:22:35.930
This isn't your post
graduate dissertation

01:22:35.932 --> 01:22:38.836
on potions for
unhappy housewives.

01:22:40.303 --> 01:22:41.872
We're making weapons here.

01:22:43.439 --> 01:22:44.642
You're delusional.

01:22:45.842 --> 01:22:47.878
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

01:22:48.879 --> 01:22:52.082
This is a non-scalable
strand, an aberration.

01:22:55.285 --> 01:22:58.122
And you sir, your services
are no longer necessary.

01:22:59.755 --> 01:23:01.789
The armament division
will never approve something

01:23:01.791 --> 01:23:02.824
you can't even understand!

01:23:02.826 --> 01:23:04.228
They already have!

01:23:05.696 --> 01:23:06.860
What do you think
freak boy was doing

01:23:06.862 --> 01:23:08.829
while he was wandering
around out there?

01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:10.934
He's got himself one
hell of a body count.

01:23:13.737 --> 01:23:14.805
You're killing him.

01:23:16.772 --> 01:23:19.740
I am not doing anything
he wouldn't eventually

01:23:19.742 --> 01:23:20.910
do to himself.

01:23:23.213 --> 01:23:24.913
I can't let you do this.

01:23:24.915 --> 01:23:25.879
Well you just,

01:24:13.496 --> 01:24:14.828
Sam.

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:15.497
Sam!

01:24:15.499 --> 01:24:16.332
Can you hear me?

01:24:20.437 --> 01:24:23.037
Sam, breathe.

01:24:23.039 --> 01:24:24.041
You need to breathe.

01:24:24.974 --> 01:24:26.009
Stay with me.

01:24:29.478 --> 01:24:31.214
Did I mess up, doc?

01:24:32.182 --> 01:24:33.150
No.

01:24:34.851 --> 01:24:35.820
You saved my life.

01:24:37.387 --> 01:24:38.222
No.

01:24:39.222 --> 01:24:40.057
Not me.

01:24:41.825 --> 01:24:43.394
It was Ray.

01:24:46.495 --> 01:24:47.464
It was you, Sam.

01:24:48.999 --> 01:24:50.965
You all along.

01:24:50.967 --> 01:24:52.303
Everything else
is just memories.

01:24:54.237 --> 01:24:56.741
Whoah, we need to get
you to a hospital.

01:24:57.941 --> 01:25:00.842
But no, I don't want.

01:25:00.844 --> 01:25:02.010
Don't want?

01:25:02.012 --> 01:25:02.979
What do you mean you don't want?

01:25:05.115 --> 01:25:07.050
I'm so sorry I
got you into this.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.021
I truly am.

01:25:13.589 --> 01:25:15.992
I've done such
horrible things.

01:25:19.929 --> 01:25:21.499
I remember everything.

01:25:24.099 --> 01:25:25.102
I feel everything.

01:25:28.905 --> 01:25:32.041
All of them, emotions.

01:25:33.043 --> 01:25:34.311
I feel them all.

01:25:35.978 --> 01:25:37.514
I'm always, blinding,

01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:42.986
there's no more pain.

01:25:44.588 --> 01:25:45.421
I'm free.

01:25:48.991 --> 01:25:49.826
I feel,

01:26:08.978 --> 01:26:09.979
Therefore I am.

01:27:15.178 --> 01:27:18.381
Sam, Sam, bend!

01:27:19.448 --> 01:27:20.284
Sam!

01:27:21.483 --> 01:27:22.553
You need to bend!

01:27:24.387 --> 01:27:26.023
You need to bend!

01:27:52.048 --> 01:27:53.547
As
expected, he turned out

01:27:53.549 --> 01:27:56.150
to be more responsive
than all the others.

01:27:56.152 --> 01:27:57.385
We're bringing him out soon.

01:27:57.387 --> 01:27:59.423
Can't believe how
long he's been under.

01:28:00.589 --> 01:28:02.356
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:28:02.358 --> 01:28:04.061
Way below the E quadrant.

01:28:06.228 --> 01:28:08.064
He's
something all right.

01:28:09.232 --> 01:28:10.067
Yeah.

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:13.202
What was he mumbling
when you came in?

01:28:14.304 --> 01:28:16.037
His brother.

01:28:16.039 --> 01:28:17.137
Ray?

01:28:17.139 --> 01:28:19.140
The poor guy never made it.

01:28:19.142 --> 01:28:21.109
But this one's sure
to set a new record.

01:28:21.111 --> 01:28:23.343
Whatever he set,
this man just got

01:28:23.345 --> 01:28:24.682
a second chance at life.
