You have a nine year old son
that you don't see!

01:33.986 --> 01:35.320
No, I don't.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.089
Because I don't like him,
and I didn't want him,

01:37.089 --> 01:38.724

08:34.972 --> 08:39.110
and I'm gon' get to
the bottom of this.

08:39.710 --> 08:41.078
Are you done?

08:41.078 --> 08:42.713
[Pam] No.

08:42.713 --> 08:46.217
'Cause that man's wife killed
herself in your shit.

08:46.217 --> 08:47.852
-Okay, Pam...
-[Pam] Hell...

08:47.852 --> 08:50.254
Aaron might be fine and crazy.

08:50.955 --> 08:52.590
Okay.

08:52.590 --> 08:54.358
All right, girl.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.160
Whew!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.561
I'm goin' in.

08:58.229 --> 09:00.197
Mm-hm.
Goin' in!

09:01.365 --> 09:03.934
You know you don't pay me enough
for this, right?

09:03.934 --> 09:04.935
[music]

09:08.915 --> 09:18.058
[music]

09:18.058 --> 09:18.959
Calvin.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.561
I don't feel like talkin' to you
right now, Maurice.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.364
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.999
Yeah, okay.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.400
I mean it.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.638
Look man, it's fine.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.574
I got upset.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.576
You got upset?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.579
You forget he took
half of my shit, too?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.415
He shoulda took them blouses
and shit.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.650
Ugly.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.186
Really, Maurice?

09:46.186 --> 09:47.454
[Maurice] Yes, honey.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.423
Too many florals and paisleys
for a man.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.626
You think this shit is funny?

09:54.060 --> 09:55.128
No.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.796
But I'mma get your shit back.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.131
How you gonna do that?

09:58.131 --> 10:01.101
He stole my car, and I have
a tracker on it.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.635
It's at the airport.

10:02.635 --> 10:06.072
Look, I don't think you should
go dealin' with this dude.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.209
I have an extra set of keys
here,

10:09.209 --> 10:12.379
and I'm going to go and get
my shit.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.114
I don't think you should.

10:14.481 --> 10:17.417
You think I should just
let this fly?

10:17.417 --> 10:20.153
No, I think you should just
let this shit go.

10:20.687 --> 10:25.225
This bitch has me here drinking
out of plastic cups.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.993
I'm goin' to get my shit!

10:26.993 --> 10:29.829
I am a crystal kind of a girl!

10:30.830 --> 10:32.699
And he sold it all!

10:34.267 --> 10:37.637
What is a queen without a crown?

10:37.937 --> 10:39.339
Maurice, really?

10:39.339 --> 10:40.440
Simply a peasant!

10:40.440 --> 10:42.409
This shit isn't funny!

10:43.676 --> 10:44.744
All right, fine.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.547
Can you be serious just for
one minute?

10:47.547 --> 10:49.682
Okay, okay.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.685
I think you should just
let it go.

10:52.685 --> 10:53.953
[Maurice] I can't.

10:53.953 --> 10:55.055
Why?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.723
All the pain that he caused me?

10:56.723 --> 11:00.460
I want that mother-- out
of my life forever.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.495
I know this hurts you,

11:02.495 --> 11:05.031
but I really think you should
let this shit go.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.701
I mean, besides, you got
the trial and everything.

11:08.701 --> 11:09.803
The trial?

11:09.803 --> 11:11.871
[Calvin] Yes, the trial.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.406
Oh, there won't be a trial.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.742
Because he's going to tell
the truth.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.410
No, he's not.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.912
[Maurice] You wanna bet?

11:19.746 --> 11:20.980
Maurice.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.916
I beat the -- ass
with a golf club,

11:22.916 --> 11:24.517
and he still wouldn't talk.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.920
I have my ways.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.122
You better leave
that shit alone.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.424
He tried to ruin my life.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.127
And if you keep messin' with
him, he's goin' to.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.729
He made me and Sabrina
lose our jobs.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.498
I'm sorry.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.600
[Maurice] Calvin...

11:41.267 --> 11:42.669
You don't know me.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.372
I'm the type of bitch that don't
-- with nobody

11:46.372 --> 11:48.174
unless they -- with me.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.909
And he -- with my heart.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.078
All right, fine.

11:52.078 --> 11:54.013
I guess there's no
talkin' to you.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.548
No, there's not.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.285
Oh...

11:59.285 --> 12:01.321
You do remember that Sabrina
got that African

12:01.321 --> 12:02.689
to post your bail, right?

12:02.689 --> 12:04.791
Why do you keep callin' him
that?

12:04.791 --> 12:06.259
Because he is!

12:06.259 --> 12:07.427
And?

12:07.427 --> 12:08.661
[Calvin] And...

12:08.661 --> 12:11.364
You need to just chill
the hell out.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.634
Yeah.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.469
All right, fine.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.971
Fine, don't listen to me.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.006
See what happens when
your bail gets revoked.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.242
I'm not doin' nothin', Calvin.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.244
Yeah, okay.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.880
[Maurice] Just going to get
my car.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.082
Okay.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.984
I'm not you, Calvin.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.821
He ain't takin' all of my shit.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.757
<i>All right.</i>

12:38.925 --> 12:41.194
[door closing]

12:41.194 --> 12:47.333
[music]

12:55.041 --> 12:56.409
Well?

12:56.709 --> 12:57.810
Where is he?

12:57.810 --> 12:59.646
-[Gary] Where is this guy?
-I have no idea.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.282
It's after five.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.883
It is after five.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.553
Should we call it?

13:07.187 --> 13:08.655
I mean, we could.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.523
You don't think we should?

13:10.523 --> 13:12.825
I don't think we should do
shit for him.

13:12.825 --> 13:13.993
Yeah.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.628
Call it.

13:17.830 --> 13:18.731
Okay.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.933
I'll let the shareholders know.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.468
Perfect, I got the contract
right here.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.938
All we gotta do is send it,
and he is out.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.239
Out the business.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.407
It's that easy?

13:27.407 --> 13:28.908
[Hayden] I mean, the -- not
here.

13:28.908 --> 13:31.344
I told you he wasn't gonna
be able to come up with

13:31.344 --> 13:32.712
that money, right?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.480
You were right.

13:34.847 --> 13:35.748
Guess not.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.550
Now, the real question is...

13:38.151 --> 13:39.519
Where's he at?

13:40.186 --> 13:41.788
I don't know, man.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.490
This doesn't feel right.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.693
I don't feel like he'd go down
this easy.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.594
Nah.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.562
You know what?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.598
Maybe his ass is back
in London, cryin'.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.999
-You know?
-I love it.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.569
I kinda don't.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.172
That's how it goes, man.
You know, it's a...

13:59.572 --> 14:00.440
-Hostile...
-Hostile takeover.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.808
[Hayden] Takeover, exactly.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.043
All right, so...

14:04.043 --> 14:06.379
Let me send this email.

14:08.615 --> 14:13.686
The email is officially sent,
so I mean, he's out.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.822
Well, as soon as
the shareholders sign.

14:15.822 --> 14:16.756
[Hayden] Right.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.593
I wish I could've seen the look
on his goofy-ass face.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.895
That's exactly what
I was waiting on.

14:24.430 --> 14:25.732
You know, though.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.135
He's gonna contest.
Absolutely gonna contest.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.904
If he's worth his salt, he will.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.773
Bro, he's gonna fight the hell
outta this thing.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.775
But you know what?

14:35.775 --> 14:37.877
If he comes back,
we'll be prepared.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.712
Shit, we won.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.180
-We won, it bro.
-I won.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.115
Look at you.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.283
[Gary] Yeah.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.984
Come after what's mine...

14:44.984 --> 14:45.952
[Hayden] Mm-hm.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.255
All right, I mean, we won, so...

14:49.255 --> 14:50.790
I guess I'm gonna
get up outta here.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.159
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you goin'?

14:53.426 --> 14:55.228
Where you think I'm goin'?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.529
Wait, so, you, you...

14:56.529 --> 14:57.797
You don't wanna have a drink
and celebrate?

14:57.797 --> 14:59.332
-Bruh...
-We just, the plan?

14:59.332 --> 15:00.833
-Hey...
-Everything we just did?

15:00.833 --> 15:02.135
Tamara tryin' to get me
that thing,

15:02.135 --> 15:03.236
you know what I'm sayin'?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.904
Once I hit, they don't quit.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.673
Come on, bro.
I gotta go handle that.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.808
Okay, that's what's happening?

15:08.808 --> 15:10.009
You already know what's
happening.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.044
You know I get down.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.045
Okay.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.447
Hayden...

15:14.447 --> 15:16.182
Do you know anything
about this woman?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.651
I know everything
about this woman.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.421
Left, right, upside down,
all that.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.222
You know?

15:23.222 --> 15:25.024
Did you vet her?

15:25.024 --> 15:26.759
You don't wanna be gettin'
played.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.929
Uhh...Yeah, no, yeah.
No, yeah, I vetted her.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.165
You didn't.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.599
Nah, I didn't vet her, no.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.634
I know you're lying.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.036
I was lyin', but I got my own...

15:37.036 --> 15:39.105
Vetting process,
you know what I'm saying?

15:39.105 --> 15:41.507
You want me to look into this
Tamara girl for you?

15:41.507 --> 15:42.942
[Hayden] Bro.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.744
-Find out some more information?
-Gary, you trippin' bro.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.246
I got it.
I'm good, I promise.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.281
Aight?

15:48.681 --> 15:50.383
You're mad, Hayden.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.984
I'm mad, see?
Now you get it.

15:51.984 --> 15:54.420
Hey, we gon' celebrate later
though, all right?

15:54.420 --> 15:55.555
-All right.
-My dude.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.023
Appreciate you.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.057
Yes, sir.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.127
Hey.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.795
Hi.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.730
So...

16:04.197 --> 16:05.431
Am I seeing you tonight?

16:05.431 --> 16:06.899
I will let you know.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.568
Okay.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.002
Okay.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.472
-Bye.
-Have a great day at work.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.909
[Fatima] Girl...

16:17.176 --> 16:18.244
Don't.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.481
You know that -- works
my nerves.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.049
I know.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.183
As long as you know.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.986
You make it perfectly clear
every time.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.187
Yes.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.522
Well, I'm about to go home.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.023
Okay.
Are you and Zac good?

16:31.357 --> 16:33.559
Girl, we are so good.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.596
Remind me to tell you
the lesson I taught him.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.664
He's not concussed, is he?

16:39.031 --> 16:40.299
Girl, he's fine.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.235
-Okay, that's good.
-[Fatima] I'll see you later.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.270
-See you in the morning.
-All right, I'll see you.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.571
Bye.

16:57.275 --> 16:58.776
Damn.

16:59.444 --> 17:00.745
What's up, Pam?

17:01.045 --> 17:02.180
Hey, Zac.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.015
Where's Karen?

17:04.015 --> 17:05.183
She in there.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.351
Aight.

17:07.351 --> 17:08.853
She's in a mood.

17:09.187 --> 17:10.555
When is she not in a mood?

17:10.555 --> 17:12.957
Yeah, but today ain't the day.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.759
I just gotta talk to her.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.029
<i>The preacher man had
a woman out there.</i>

17:18.629 --> 17:19.997
I don't want no parts of that.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.433
All right, well go on in
and get your head cut off.

17:23.134 --> 17:25.903
And try not to mess up
that back room!

17:26.504 --> 17:27.805
You done, Pam?

17:27.805 --> 17:30.742
No, and don't be back there
-- again.

17:31.542 --> 17:32.744
Really?

17:32.744 --> 17:34.746
Either way, I got to clean
it up.

17:35.613 --> 17:37.648
I heard about you, too,
back there.

17:38.082 --> 17:39.517
Yeah, yeah.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.952
Boy, get outta here!

17:42.220 --> 17:43.788
You talk too much!

17:44.188 --> 17:45.223
[Zac] Me?!

17:45.223 --> 17:46.791
-Yes!
-[Zac] Yeah, all right, Pam..

17:46.791 --> 17:48.259
Don't repeat shit.

17:51.763 --> 17:54.065
[door opening]
[knocking on door]

17:54.065 --> 17:55.233
[Karen] Come in.

17:58.603 --> 17:59.804
[Zac] Hey.

18:03.674 --> 18:04.742
Look, I...

18:05.376 --> 18:09.113
Not comin' to cause trouble,
I just came to apologize.

18:10.815 --> 18:13.484
Okay.
You can go now.

18:13.484 --> 18:14.952
No, really.

18:15.953 --> 18:16.954
I'm sorry.

18:19.624 --> 18:20.591
You know, Zac...

18:21.425 --> 18:23.694
You ain't really been sorry
to me a day in your life,

18:23.694 --> 18:24.862
'cause if you were,

18:24.862 --> 18:26.030
then we wouldn't
be in this situation,

18:26.030 --> 18:27.765
and I wouldn't need to sign
those papers.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.133
Karen...

18:31.469 --> 18:33.037
I'm really, truly sorry.

18:33.037 --> 18:35.072
Well, I'm really, truly not
signin' 'em.

18:36.007 --> 18:37.175
<i>Okay.</i>

18:37.975 --> 18:40.444
-Why you bein' like this?
-But if I do decide to sign 'em,

18:40.444 --> 18:41.846
I will let you know.

18:43.381 --> 18:44.315
All right.

18:44.615 --> 18:45.917
[Karen]<i> Yeah.</i>

18:46.551 --> 18:48.386
Why, why are you bein' like
this?

18:48.386 --> 18:50.054
I'm tryin' to apologize to you.

18:50.054 --> 18:51.622
You tryin' to apologize to me

18:51.622 --> 18:53.691
after what you did in
the restaurant?

18:55.126 --> 18:56.127
Yeah.

18:56.127 --> 18:58.229
That's why I'm tryin' to say
sorry.

18:59.163 --> 19:00.631
Okay, well...

19:00.631 --> 19:02.600
Like I said,
I'm not signin' them,

19:02.600 --> 19:04.402
but if I do,
I'll let you know.

19:04.402 --> 19:06.771
In the meantime, you can go.

19:07.505 --> 19:10.908
You know, you can really be
like both Jekyll and Hyde

19:10.908 --> 19:13.144
-at the same time.
-You and I both.

19:15.213 --> 19:17.114
All right.
Okay.

19:17.582 --> 19:18.482
Okay.

19:18.482 --> 19:19.550
<i>All right.</i>

19:19.550 --> 19:20.785
[Zac] I tried.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.253
Okay, do I have to ask you again
to leave?

19:23.821 --> 19:25.890
Fine, Karen.
No, you don't.

19:39.937 --> 19:41.239
Hey.

19:41.239 --> 19:42.773
Pam...

19:42.773 --> 19:45.576
I'm just comin' to check on you.

19:45.576 --> 19:47.078
I'm fine, okay?

19:47.078 --> 19:49.347
He didn't upset you, did he?

19:49.347 --> 19:50.381
It's fine.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.317
And I don't wanna talk about
nothin' that happened today.

19:53.317 --> 19:58.456
Okay, but my girlfriend
got that name if you want it.

19:58.456 --> 19:59.657
Okay, Pam.

19:59.924 --> 20:02.660
Okay, well just know that
I got it.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.296
All right, can you get back to
work, please?

20:05.296 --> 20:06.364
Yes.

20:06.931 --> 20:09.033
You did good today.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.535
Thank you.

20:11.535 --> 20:13.404
Killed it.

20:13.404 --> 20:14.739
I know.

20:14.739 --> 20:16.207
What time is it?

20:16.207 --> 20:17.041
[Pam] Six.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.643
-Oh, shit!
-[Pam] What?

20:19.243 --> 20:21.545
I have to get over to
the, you know...

20:21.545 --> 20:23.648
-I got this.
-[Karen] No, no.

20:23.648 --> 20:24.949
I'm gonna come back.

20:24.949 --> 20:27.218
Make sure everything is,
you know, done right.

20:27.652 --> 20:30.521
Karen, I can handle this.

20:31.255 --> 20:34.392
Pam, you wouldn't even send me
a video.

20:34.392 --> 20:35.559
I did!

20:35.960 --> 20:37.728
Of the damn ceiling?

20:38.763 --> 20:41.132
Girl, you know I take
my edibles!

20:41.132 --> 20:43.167
That's somethin' you wanna tell
your boss?

20:43.701 --> 20:45.169
-Sorry.
-[Karen] Exactly.

20:45.169 --> 20:47.672
So, I'm gonna circle back after
I meet with the girls.

20:47.672 --> 20:49.740
Okay?
I'm comin' back, trust me.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.809
-I swear I can handle it.
-[Karen] I...

20:52.043 --> 20:54.145
Will do it myself.
Okay?

20:54.145 --> 20:56.247
Just go ahead back in the room.

20:56.247 --> 20:57.715
Okay.
Fine.

20:58.149 --> 20:59.717
[Karen]<i> Thank you. So much.</i>

21:12.797 --> 21:14.131
[Andi]<i> Hello?</i>

21:14.131 --> 21:14.899
Hey.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.100
[Andi]<i> I'm on my way.</i>

21:16.100 --> 21:18.002
Okay, is 'Brina with you?

21:18.002 --> 21:20.137
[Andi]<i> She may be there already.</i>

21:20.738 --> 21:23.140
Oh, okay, well I'll see you
soon.

21:23.140 --> 21:24.575
-[Andi]<i> Okay.
</i>-All right, bye.

21:24.575 --> 21:25.776
[Andi]<i> Okay.</i>

21:29.780 --> 21:31.115
[Karen] This...

21:39.341 --> 21:40.275
Hey!

21:42.277 --> 21:43.278
Hey.

21:44.679 --> 21:45.914
What are you doin' here?

21:46.815 --> 21:48.250
Wanted to come by.

21:48.550 --> 21:49.985
[Danni] Oh, Sabrina.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.520
Called them bitches, didn't you?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.455
Yup.

21:54.723 --> 21:55.991
[Danni]<i> Damn.</i>

21:56.625 --> 21:57.892
[Andi] Where are the drinks?

21:59.761 --> 22:01.363
There's shit over here.

22:03.565 --> 22:05.200
How are you, Daniella?

22:05.200 --> 22:07.369
Oh, it's my whole name, Andrea?

22:08.103 --> 22:09.104
It is.

22:09.471 --> 22:11.239
Okay, shit, I will need a drink.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.008
[Karen] How are you, Danni?

22:15.010 --> 22:18.146
I should be askin' you that.
You're with child.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.781
[Karen] I'm fine.

22:19.781 --> 22:21.549
Yeah, that's good.
That's good to know.

22:22.083 --> 22:26.554
You know, might you happen to
be with child

22:26.554 --> 22:28.156
with your latest activities?

22:29.057 --> 22:30.659
--, what did you tell them?

22:31.359 --> 22:34.362
Oh, nothing, that you were
sleeping with the enemy!

22:34.362 --> 22:35.330
Que?!

22:35.697 --> 22:36.698
Slept with.

22:36.698 --> 22:39.034
Unbeknownst to me.

22:39.601 --> 22:41.036
Okay, so...

22:43.438 --> 22:44.639
Go on.

22:44.639 --> 22:45.940
[Karen] We didn't talk about
this.

22:45.940 --> 22:47.342
You took the words right out
of my mouth.

22:47.342 --> 22:48.977
But first, can we get
some drinks?

22:48.977 --> 22:50.345
[Karen] You know what?
I'll pour everyone the drinks.

22:50.345 --> 22:51.746
-Thank you so much.
-[Karen] Excuse me.

22:51.746 --> 22:52.914
Yeah...

22:52.914 --> 22:54.849
-Okay, look.
-[Andi] Go on.

22:55.984 --> 22:58.853
[Danni] I was trying to have...

22:59.554 --> 23:00.989
A hot girl summer.

23:01.523 --> 23:02.624
All right?

23:02.624 --> 23:03.758
Yeah, we need to talk about
that.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.026
You should stop it.

23:08.296 --> 23:09.331
Okay...

23:09.798 --> 23:11.633
You hoes get more than I do.

23:11.900 --> 23:13.368
We have the same men.

23:15.003 --> 23:17.672
Who are you talking to,
Sabrina?!

23:18.173 --> 23:20.575
You have the same men now,
in this moment,

23:20.575 --> 23:22.277
on this calendar date!

23:22.277 --> 23:23.978
But should I run it back
for you?

23:23.978 --> 23:25.180
[Sabrina] Danni...

23:25.914 --> 23:27.382
Back to...

23:27.749 --> 23:29.017
What, college?

23:29.017 --> 23:29.951
[Danni] Yeah!

23:29.951 --> 23:31.486
When we were young and reckless?

23:31.486 --> 23:33.855
Yeah, y'all was runnin' --
in college, too, like what?

23:34.356 --> 23:36.858
Okay, but what is this
really about?

23:37.325 --> 23:38.259
What?

23:39.127 --> 23:40.261
[Sabrina] We just wanna know.

23:40.995 --> 23:43.064
Y'all came all the way over here
just to judge me?

23:43.064 --> 23:46.034
Okay, we're not judgin' you,
okay?

23:46.034 --> 23:49.104
It, it feels that way.
It's givin' judgement for me.

23:49.104 --> 23:50.705
Well, that's not what this is.

23:50.705 --> 23:54.275
Okay, Danni, you just had
an incident with a stranger.

23:54.275 --> 23:56.544
I mean, you ran him over
in your car.

23:56.544 --> 23:57.579
So...

24:00.148 --> 24:02.684
He deserved it.
You know that, right?

24:03.151 --> 24:05.086
[Karen] Yes, he did.

24:05.086 --> 24:07.055
But he was a man that
you didn't know,

24:07.055 --> 24:09.190
that you let in your home.

24:09.190 --> 24:10.058
<i>Yes.</i>

24:10.058 --> 24:11.693
Okay, listen...

24:11.693 --> 24:12.861
We are.

24:13.328 --> 24:14.095
Hold on.

24:14.095 --> 24:15.497
Don't get defensive.

24:15.730 --> 24:18.366
I'm not...

24:20.568 --> 24:22.504
I'm not defensive.

24:23.605 --> 24:24.939
I just wanna say somethin'.

24:24.939 --> 24:27.976
Okay, could you say it to
Preston?

24:27.976 --> 24:31.112
We actually know him
and like him.

24:32.313 --> 24:35.083
You know, he was a stranger
once, too.

24:35.817 --> 24:37.619
But that's cool.

24:37.619 --> 24:40.155
You know, interesting,
now we don't like Gary, so...

24:40.155 --> 24:41.523
Danni, you know that's
different.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.857
-Don't bring that up.
-Okay, whatever.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.592
Can, can, so can you shut up?
Okay?

24:45.994 --> 24:47.529
<i>Okay.</i>

24:47.529 --> 24:48.496
Listen.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.633
I'm done, okay?
I'm done.

24:51.633 --> 24:53.067
It didn't work.
All right?

24:53.067 --> 24:55.970
Especially after that asshole
and Que...

24:56.504 --> 24:59.140
Okay, you know he slept with
Maurice?

24:59.874 --> 25:01.643
[Danni] You love remindin' me
of that.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.146
And I don't wanna hear
this shit, okay?

25:05.146 --> 25:07.415
We have all been in
this situation.

25:07.916 --> 25:10.351
Sim, similar.
Ish.

25:10.618 --> 25:12.086
Maybe not the exact.

25:12.086 --> 25:14.656
-[Andi] Okay.
-I'm just gon' say it.

25:15.423 --> 25:16.558
Karen...

25:16.558 --> 25:17.892
No.

25:17.892 --> 25:20.195
'Cause we supposed to tell
the truth, right?

25:22.630 --> 25:26.100
Truth, according to Karen.
This will be...

25:29.037 --> 25:30.405
I'm listening.

25:32.807 --> 25:37.378
When we were in college,
you was smokin' and drinkin',

25:37.378 --> 25:39.781
you was screwin' a lot
of them boys.

25:40.048 --> 25:41.483
Good times.

25:41.483 --> 25:43.618
You were right there with me,
remember homecoming?

25:43.618 --> 25:45.053
Not like you.

25:45.687 --> 25:46.754
Not like me?

25:47.188 --> 25:48.957
Shall we do a tally?

25:52.026 --> 25:52.961
Danni...

25:53.828 --> 25:56.865
Do you remember when we was all
at that frat party?

25:57.131 --> 25:59.033
What them boys tried to
do to you?

26:03.004 --> 26:04.939
We just bringin' that up, huh?
Just...

26:05.373 --> 26:07.475
Out of the trackless air?

26:11.513 --> 26:12.514
It's good.

26:15.216 --> 26:16.718
It was really sad.

26:17.118 --> 26:20.321
Oh, I know it.
You know, 'cause I was there.

26:22.490 --> 26:26.761
And the aftermath, the things
that they were saying...

26:27.228 --> 26:30.732
Awful, I still remember.
It's still there.

26:33.234 --> 26:35.203
Okay, well, we're concerned.

26:35.937 --> 26:37.305
Yeah, listen.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.575
You know what?

26:41.175 --> 26:43.411
You're concerned, so you can say
whatever you want.

26:43.411 --> 26:45.280
Go on.
You're concerned, so just...

26:45.280 --> 26:47.048
-[Karen] Danni...
-It's concern.

26:47.382 --> 26:49.684
You were uncomfortable
with your weight.

26:50.618 --> 26:52.453
And you was tryin' to find
your confidence in

26:52.453 --> 26:54.289
all these dangerous situations.

26:54.289 --> 26:56.991
You let the wrong people know
that, okay?

26:57.525 --> 26:58.927
And they tried to take
advantage of you.

26:58.927 --> 27:00.194
That's what happened.

27:01.563 --> 27:02.664
This is great.

27:02.664 --> 27:06.167
Psychologist Karen might be
my favorite.

27:09.370 --> 27:12.707
So, psychologist, had you
considered that maybe

27:12.707 --> 27:15.810
I was using them the way
they were using me?

27:15.810 --> 27:18.279
Yeah, you said that then, too.

27:19.113 --> 27:20.782
Okay, shit!

27:22.216 --> 27:25.920
You know, when a man does this,
there's no intervention.

27:26.220 --> 27:27.522
There's no huddle up.

27:27.522 --> 27:28.389
Okay?

27:28.389 --> 27:29.857
-But a woman...
-Okay.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.426
-[Danni] Hold the phone.
-That is not what we're saying.

27:31.426 --> 27:32.627
And that is not what
this is about.

27:32.627 --> 27:35.597
Okay, 'cause it, it sounds
like...

27:35.597 --> 27:37.365
That to me...

27:37.665 --> 27:38.633
Okay...

27:39.867 --> 27:41.002
Danni...

27:41.703 --> 27:46.541
We are here to say we love you,
and we are scared for you.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.810
And if you don't wanna be
with Preston,

27:48.810 --> 27:50.712
that's completely fine.

27:51.045 --> 27:52.513
-But...
-[Sabrina] No.

27:52.513 --> 27:56.184
He's...
So damn near perfect.

27:58.119 --> 27:59.220
Wow.

28:00.188 --> 28:01.255
Danni, it is.

28:02.023 --> 28:05.360
No, go on, I'd love to hear more
about his perfection from you.

28:06.561 --> 28:09.864
Danni, if you're gonna have
a hot girl summer,

28:09.864 --> 28:12.133
just have a safe one.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.168
That's all.

28:14.702 --> 28:15.770
<i>Noted.</i>

28:16.638 --> 28:19.173
You know we only saying this to
you because we love you, right?

28:19.173 --> 28:20.508
She knows that.

28:21.209 --> 28:22.577
Does she?

28:25.413 --> 28:26.814
You know that, right?

28:27.615 --> 28:29.684
Yeah, I'm really feelin'
the love.

28:29.684 --> 28:31.185
I am, so...

28:31.819 --> 28:33.755
We done here?
We good?

28:35.289 --> 28:38.526
Yeah?
I got my man comin' over, so...

28:38.526 --> 28:41.529
We can speed this right along.

28:41.996 --> 28:42.997
Danni...

28:42.997 --> 28:45.233
What?
Met him on the 'Gram.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.368
It's a good dating site.

28:48.302 --> 28:50.038
We can't talk to her when
she's like this.

28:50.038 --> 28:51.906
[Danni] You damn sure can't.

28:51.906 --> 28:53.374
No.

28:53.374 --> 28:55.143
No, you cannot...

28:55.143 --> 28:57.311
Talk to me like I'm a child.

28:57.845 --> 28:59.580
And y'all are so perfect,

28:59.580 --> 29:01.182
and I should just sit
at your feet

29:01.182 --> 29:02.850
and learn from thee.

29:03.184 --> 29:05.086
Okay, we're not saying that
we're perfect.

29:05.353 --> 29:06.721
We know that.

29:06.721 --> 29:08.823
Oh, I know, 'cause I can run
your shit down.

29:09.657 --> 29:12.727
<i>Backwards and forwards.
Forwards and backwards.</i>

29:13.661 --> 29:16.030
Okay, are we really doing this
right now?

29:16.030 --> 29:17.932
[Danni] No, no...

29:17.932 --> 29:19.434
That's what I'm doing.

29:19.434 --> 29:21.703
You know, Gary with the wife,

29:22.837 --> 29:24.472
you know, who, who, who's...

29:24.472 --> 29:26.474
like, he threw off
a building, right?

29:26.474 --> 29:28.443
Like, accidentally.

29:29.243 --> 29:30.912
Same lady...

29:30.912 --> 29:33.948
'Cause crazy never dies,
shows up at your house.

29:34.749 --> 29:38.252
Shoots him, holds you at
gunpoint.

29:40.021 --> 29:42.824
And then frivolously sues
all of us!

29:46.060 --> 29:47.495
But you're an expert.

29:48.429 --> 29:49.864
And you got advice for me.

29:51.933 --> 29:53.367
Good counsel.

29:54.736 --> 29:58.639
Paris, the grandma and
his house, how was that?

29:58.639 --> 29:59.941
And now Robin.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.877
You know, so, that's
interesting.

30:02.877 --> 30:05.580
And you know, you,
the gentleman with the vibrator.

30:05.980 --> 30:08.149
-Hold on now, Danni.
-[Danni] Okay, this is good.

30:08.149 --> 30:10.485
And he walks in on you with
another man,

30:10.485 --> 30:12.086
the man who cried wolf.

30:12.553 --> 30:15.423
So, there was that,
and then you.

30:15.423 --> 30:17.391
And this gets really tricky
for me, here.

30:17.391 --> 30:20.328
Because a woman walks into
your salon,

30:20.862 --> 30:23.364
kills herself, turns out she's
the ex-wife

30:23.364 --> 30:25.967
of the preacher you were with.

30:25.967 --> 30:27.502
Hell of a sentence, right there.

30:27.502 --> 30:30.872
But now, even better sentence,
you're pregnant.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.306
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

30:32.306 --> 30:36.377
But you don't know if it's
his baby or your ex's.

30:39.747 --> 30:43.284
<i>So, this is really rich
coming from you guys.</i>

30:44.719 --> 30:46.687
We're just tryin' to talk
to you, Danni.

30:47.722 --> 30:49.190
-- you, Sabrina.

30:49.657 --> 30:51.392
You're always the victim.

30:52.126 --> 30:54.962
-- you, Andi,
and -- you, Karen.

30:56.097 --> 30:57.298
So, this is bullshit.

30:57.665 --> 30:59.901
You guys come in my home
and attack me.

30:59.901 --> 31:03.838
Funny, it's the same place that
a man repeatedly slapped me,

31:04.572 --> 31:07.241
spat on me like a dog.

31:07.608 --> 31:10.945
In this very place.
So, déjà vu.

31:10.945 --> 31:13.881
So, you all can get the -- out
of my house,

31:13.881 --> 31:15.216
and you can stay gone.

31:15.216 --> 31:16.384
Okay?

31:16.384 --> 31:18.452
Girl, that won't work on us.

31:20.154 --> 31:21.556
We're not leaving you.

31:22.390 --> 31:26.360
You might be mad, but,
but we still sisters.

31:27.128 --> 31:28.596
Always.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.199
Sisters.

31:31.199 --> 31:32.300
Yeah.

31:32.934 --> 31:36.404
Yeah, you right, you right.
Sisterhood.

31:38.206 --> 31:39.740
All right, well, I'm out.

31:41.242 --> 31:44.045
Okay.
Sisters, right?

31:44.045 --> 31:46.380
You can stay.
I'll -- go.

31:46.380 --> 31:48.850
-[Andi] Danni, Danni...
-[Danni] Not my keys.

31:48.850 --> 31:50.451
-[Andi] Danni.
-Here are mine!

31:50.451 --> 31:51.686
-[Danni] I'm out!
-Danni!

31:51.686 --> 31:53.754
[Karen] We gonna be here
when you get back!

31:54.789 --> 31:55.823
Better not be.

31:56.457 --> 31:57.825
[Sabrina] We're not leaving you.

32:13.307 --> 32:15.009
That didn't go well.

32:15.910 --> 32:17.345
I knew it wouldn't.

32:27.222 --> 32:29.424
Don't be smilin' when
you walk in here.

32:30.291 --> 32:31.493
I had to do it.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.361
I'm still mad at you.

32:34.062 --> 32:35.764
Listen, that's what you get.

32:36.398 --> 32:37.732
Gimme a kiss.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.401
I'm still mad.

32:39.901 --> 32:40.802
Whatever.

32:40.802 --> 32:41.770
Yeah, whatever.

32:45.206 --> 32:46.207
Open the door.

32:46.808 --> 32:48.610
Why?
Ain't nobody at the door.

32:49.811 --> 32:51.212
Just go open it.

32:51.212 --> 32:52.981
[knocking on door]

32:53.515 --> 32:55.617
What is that,
a woman's intuition?

32:58.219 --> 32:59.287
Little psychic.

32:59.754 --> 33:02.457
Just open the door.
Open it.

33:04.259 --> 33:05.493
Hey.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.128
What's up?

33:07.128 --> 33:08.530
Come on in, girl.

33:10.165 --> 33:11.132
Have a seat.

33:11.800 --> 33:12.801
Thanks.

33:17.338 --> 33:18.540
Sit down.

33:23.478 --> 33:25.113
What's this about?

33:25.113 --> 33:27.916
Well, Zac wanted to talk to you.

33:28.349 --> 33:30.485
Well, I have a lawyer.

33:31.319 --> 33:33.488
No, you don't.
Remember?

33:34.589 --> 33:36.090
Okay, well...

33:36.090 --> 33:37.425
I'm gonna get another one.

33:38.092 --> 33:40.929
Okay, but maybe you should talk
to Zac, first.

33:42.130 --> 33:43.164
Okay, fine.

33:46.768 --> 33:48.937
Why is he lookin' at me
like that?

33:49.237 --> 33:50.705
-Don't.
-What?

33:50.705 --> 33:52.407
-Girl, he's fine.
-Do I need the police?

33:52.407 --> 33:54.442
No, no, you do not.

33:54.442 --> 33:56.311
I don't like this shit!

33:56.311 --> 33:57.812
[Fatima] We just wanna talk
to you.

33:57.812 --> 33:59.247
-I need you to...
-I got it.

33:59.247 --> 34:00.782
-Okay.
-Calm.

34:00.782 --> 34:01.749
Yes.

34:02.851 --> 34:05.019
I just wanted to talk to you
about child support.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.688
You do?

34:06.688 --> 34:09.357
Yes, I do.
Okay?

34:09.357 --> 34:11.993
I have my attorney drawin' up
a deal.

34:12.560 --> 34:15.597
Okay.
Well, how much?

34:16.431 --> 34:19.434
Mm-hm.
"How much?"

34:20.301 --> 34:22.136
Two thousand dollars a month.

34:24.439 --> 34:25.607
For real?

34:26.040 --> 34:27.108
Yes.

34:28.176 --> 34:30.178
Well, shit, where do I sign?!

34:31.980 --> 34:33.081
Seriously?

34:33.081 --> 34:34.983
Yeah, shit!
I'll take that all day long.

34:36.351 --> 34:38.920
I wanna see my son every
weekend.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.856
Shit, you can see him all year
if you want him,

34:41.856 --> 34:43.191
I'll go get him right now.

34:43.191 --> 34:45.093
All right, can we sign
these papers, please?

34:46.261 --> 34:47.662
Where is it at?

34:47.662 --> 34:49.731
-It's right here.
-What I would do for two grand!

34:49.731 --> 34:51.533
Here's the papers, but listen.

34:51.533 --> 34:53.635
You need to have a lawyer
look over them.

34:54.202 --> 34:55.470
No, I don't.

34:56.037 --> 34:57.338
Yes, you do.

34:57.338 --> 34:59.474
Just have him look over 'em,
and bring 'em back to us.

35:00.108 --> 35:01.242
<i>Wow.
Wow.</i>

35:01.843 --> 35:04.112
Do you know a lawyer?

35:05.313 --> 35:07.315
I know somebody...

35:07.315 --> 35:08.650
Okay, good.

35:09.284 --> 35:10.818
So have him look at them,

35:10.818 --> 35:13.321
and if he tries to tell you
that you can get more,

35:13.588 --> 35:15.123
then you won't get shit.

35:15.957 --> 35:16.925
'Kay?

35:19.160 --> 35:20.428
Okay.

35:20.428 --> 35:21.629
All right.

35:21.896 --> 35:22.997
Thank you.

35:22.997 --> 35:24.332
-Get those back to us.
-Deal, deal, deal!

35:24.332 --> 35:25.767
-All right.
-Thank you!

35:25.767 --> 35:27.902
-Ah, ah!
-No, no, no, no.

35:27.902 --> 35:29.270
Okay, okay!

35:29.270 --> 35:30.405
[Fatima] We're not doin' that.

35:30.405 --> 35:31.773
Okay.

35:32.206 --> 35:33.942
-Bye.
-Bye, girl.

35:35.577 --> 35:38.279
[Heather] Two grand, ha ha!

35:39.013 --> 35:40.014
Damn.

35:40.915 --> 35:43.851
How, how could she be so, like,
thirsty...?

35:43.851 --> 35:47.422
Don't, don't do that.
You know how to pick 'em.

35:47.422 --> 35:49.557
Well, until you met me, so...

35:49.557 --> 35:51.593
I'm just sayin', it was one
crazy night,

35:51.593 --> 35:53.661
and this is my whole life, now.

35:53.661 --> 35:55.029
Yeah, life.

35:56.030 --> 35:57.065
18 years.

35:59.033 --> 35:59.968
Yeah.

36:02.570 --> 36:04.172
I spoke to Karen.

36:06.474 --> 36:07.709
You did?

36:08.276 --> 36:10.278
She's not signin' the papers.

36:10.278 --> 36:11.779
I knew that.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.748
[Zac] Sorry.

36:14.582 --> 36:16.851
Look, I know she gon' sue
your ass.

36:17.652 --> 36:19.420
We just gon' have to deal
with it.

36:19.420 --> 36:20.788
I'm sorry.

36:21.589 --> 36:22.757
Hey.

36:23.091 --> 36:23.992
Life.

36:24.258 --> 36:25.526
Life.

36:25.526 --> 36:27.662
Yeah.
Life.

36:28.896 --> 36:31.132
But at least my baby daddy
wasn't real.

36:31.633 --> 36:32.867
It's not funny.

36:32.867 --> 36:35.203
I wish my baby mamas wasn't
real.

36:35.203 --> 36:38.873
Yeah, well, they are,
so we just gotta deal with it.

36:39.407 --> 36:40.808
Yeah.

36:40.808 --> 36:43.277
-[unintelligible].
-Can I get a hug?

36:43.277 --> 36:44.879
[Fatima] Come on.

36:45.647 --> 36:47.815
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

36:50.218 --> 36:51.886
-Come on.
-All right.

36:52.487 --> 36:54.255
Let's go get ready for
these kids.

36:54.255 --> 36:55.957
We gon' need a bigger house.

36:59.460 --> 37:03.965
[phone ringing]

37:05.133 --> 37:06.167
[Preston]<i> Hey.</i>

37:06.534 --> 37:08.136
[Danni]<i> What is it, Preston?</i>

37:08.136 --> 37:09.337
Damn, Danni.

37:10.238 --> 37:12.340
I don't wanna meet that girl,
Preston.

37:12.340 --> 37:14.175
Look, I didn't call about that.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.010
[Danni]<i> All right,
then what is it?</i>

37:16.010 --> 37:17.812
I left some things
at your house.

37:19.847 --> 37:21.749
Really?
Really?

37:22.016 --> 37:23.551
Can I just get my clothes?

37:24.018 --> 37:26.387
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You do this shit on purpose.

37:27.355 --> 37:28.523
No, I don't.

37:28.523 --> 37:30.058
[Danni]<i> No, no, I know you do.</i>

37:30.058 --> 37:32.093
Just so that you can have
a reason...

37:32.493 --> 37:34.896
To, I don't know, just...

37:35.430 --> 37:36.664
Bother me?

37:37.331 --> 37:38.566
I swear, I didn't.

37:38.900 --> 37:40.301
[Danni]<i> Okay.</i>

37:40.301 --> 37:42.370
Well, how 'bout I just put
your shit in a box,

37:42.370 --> 37:43.738
and leave it at the front door.

37:43.738 --> 37:45.807
-Does that work?
-What's wrong with you?

37:45.807 --> 37:47.208
[Danni]<i> Don't worry
about all that.</i>

37:47.208 --> 37:49.844
Danni, this attitude is gettin'
real old.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.679
I don't care.

37:51.679 --> 37:53.781
Look, I'm just a block
away from you.

37:53.781 --> 37:55.249
[Danni]<i> I don't care.</i>

37:55.783 --> 37:57.752
I'mma leave your shit
at the front door, okay?

37:57.752 --> 37:59.654
Okay.
All right, fine.

37:59.921 --> 38:02.056
All right.
Thank you.

38:02.523 --> 38:03.891
<i>Goodbye, Preston.</i>

38:03.891 --> 38:06.027
-Danni...
-Goodbye.

38:06.027 --> 38:11.966
[music]

38:27.548 --> 38:29.484
You son of a bitch.

38:29.484 --> 38:30.518
Hey.

38:30.752 --> 38:32.286
Don't "hey" me.

38:33.287 --> 38:34.756
What are you doin'?

38:34.756 --> 38:36.090
Where's my shit?

38:36.491 --> 38:37.725
What are you talkin' about?

38:38.259 --> 38:40.128
The shit that you stole
from my house.

38:40.128 --> 38:41.929
I didn't take nothin'
from your house.

38:42.530 --> 38:44.766
Yeah.
