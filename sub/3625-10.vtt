[Gossip Girl]
Gossip girl here.

00:02.437 --> 00:03.351
Your one and only source

00:03.438 --> 00:04.439
into the scandalous

00:04.526 --> 00:05.440
lives of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.527 --> 00:06.919
Isn't that Carter Baizen?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.312
You're the guy
who gave us our first joint.

00:08.399 --> 00:09.444
'Snuck us into our first club.'

00:09.531 --> 00:10.619
I'm in this weekly game.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.316
'High stakes, big money.'

00:12.403 --> 00:13.752
- You set me up.
- No one forced his hand.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.102
Your boy lost fair and square.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.017
I know who Blair
and those girls are

00:17.104 --> 00:18.801
but I know who I am
and I'm not

00:18.888 --> 00:20.281
gonna forget that just
'cause I hang out with them.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.152
You're dismissed,
Jenny. For good.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.719
[Rufus]
I'm sorry I kissed you.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.851
Your mother must have been kinda
surprised to see you.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.115
- 'Yeah, she was.'
- Hi, Rufus.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.682
If she's in your life, you're
never gonna get over her.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.076
You should deal with your
father. He needs you. I don't.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.512
We broke up, okay?

00:34.599 --> 00:36.775
I like you. Only you.

00:36.862 --> 00:39.691
That's good, because I feel
the same about you.

00:39.778 --> 00:42.172
- Do you like me?
- 'Define like.'

00:42.259 --> 00:44.653
Tell me you didn't sleep
with Chuck for revenge.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.872
Well, it wasn't because I like
his natural musk.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.615
[female narrator]
Where has she been?

00:50.702 --> 00:52.182
[Gossip Girl]
And who am I?

00:52.269 --> 00:54.271
That's not a secret
I'll never tell.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.274
You know you love me.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.494
XOXO.

01:04.542 --> 01:07.632
[Gossip Girl]
Hey, Upper East Siders,
it's that time of year again.

01:07.719 --> 01:09.721
When the mere act
of descending a staircase

01:09.808 --> 01:10.940
means you're a woman.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.334
That's right. Debutante season.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.118
And from what we hear,
there's been

01:15.205 --> 01:17.947
some changes to the lineup.

01:18.034 --> 01:20.080
I'm actually glad
I'm going with Prince Theodore

01:20.167 --> 01:21.690
instead of Nate.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.039
The further we get
from the breakup

01:23.126 --> 01:25.650
the more self-involved
I see he was.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.610
Always so brooding,
so tortured. Ugh.

01:28.697 --> 01:31.003
A Girl wants Romeo. Not Hamlet.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.614
- Romeo died.
- Yeah.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.181
But he died
for something exciting.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.486
And I want my debutante ball

01:35.573 --> 01:38.010
to be something to die for.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.796
Hey, so, uh, has Blair
mentioned who's escorting her?

01:40.883 --> 01:44.408
Why? Are you having remorse
sex fantasies about your ex?

01:44.495 --> 01:47.063
What? No.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.240
Don't eff with an effer.
I know that look.

01:50.327 --> 01:51.937
No, man, it's just
every time I see her lately

01:52.024 --> 01:55.332
something's different. You know,
she's lighter. She's happier.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.552
Ah, she's just less-less Blair.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.468
She does have a certain
glow about her, doesn't she?

02:00.555 --> 02:02.557
I don't understand
why you don't get this, okay?

02:02.644 --> 02:04.863
A debutante ball is all
a girl could ask for.

02:04.950 --> 02:08.128
It's gorgeous and formal
and totally legendary.

02:08.215 --> 02:11.392
Don't forget out of touch
and totally classist.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.176
And if that's how you feel,
then why are you even going?

02:13.263 --> 02:15.047
I'm not going and neither
is Serena, actually.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.353
I'm just going to meet
her grandmother to make

02:16.440 --> 02:18.399
a good impression, and, uh

02:18.486 --> 02:21.053
take off before I put my foot
in my mouth, like I usually do.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.274
All I get with Nate is some rose
in the back of a town car

02:24.361 --> 02:26.363
but with the prince,
I get a security detail

02:26.450 --> 02:28.713
and a high-speed chase
to the Pierre after it's over.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.325
Ooh! I can see you on the cover
of "Hello!" already.

02:31.412 --> 02:34.154
Yeah, well, try
the "New York Times".

02:34.241 --> 02:37.157
They've chosen me
for "A Night Out With" and I'm

02:37.244 --> 02:39.637
gonna give them the most perfect
night out of the year.

02:39.724 --> 02:42.814
With my dad in rehab, it's like
the pressure's finally off me.

02:42.901 --> 02:46.688
You know, I can see
Blair clearly, and it's..

02:46.775 --> 02:48.255
...I don't know, man.
I think I might miss her.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.476
You don't miss her, man.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.086
[Blair]
'Is your mom mad that you're not
being presented?'

02:54.174 --> 02:55.740
Well, she doesn't really
have a leg to stand on

02:55.827 --> 02:57.873
since I found out she
used to be my boyfriend's

02:57.960 --> 03:00.136
father's biggest fan.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.225
Ew! It sounds so gross
when you say it out loud.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.271
Silly me. Here I actually
thought you wanted to go.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.098
- I'm here with you, aren't I?
- Yeah.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.839
It's only 'cause your
grandmother's meeting you here.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.189
Blah, blah, blah.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.103
[piano music]

03:15.195 --> 03:16.326
[indistinct chatter]

03:48.140 --> 03:51.143
- Oh, you're here! I'm so glad.
- Hey.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.754
I can't wait for you
to meet my Grandma CeCe.

03:52.841 --> 03:53.929
'You're just gonna love her.'

03:54.016 --> 03:56.018
[Dan]
'I'm sure I will.'

03:56.105 --> 03:58.107
Well, if you don't listen to me,
you're gonna hear it from her

03:58.194 --> 04:00.109
and I promise, you don't
want that to happen.

04:00.196 --> 04:03.721
The brands I listed are the key
to her happiness.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.723
And that includes Tanqueray.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.467
Dan. Jenny, it's
so good to see you.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.773
- Hi.
- 'Oh!'

04:11.860 --> 04:13.557
Hey, Jenny, What are you even
doing here?

04:13.644 --> 04:14.993
Well, she loves these things,
apparently.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.822
Well, I wish Serena did,
it would make my life..

04:17.909 --> 04:18.954
...a whole lot easier.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.260
My Grandma was the chairwoman

04:20.347 --> 04:22.305
for this event for 15 years.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.394
And now the committee's
asked my mom to join.

04:24.481 --> 04:27.136
And my daughter could not
wait to go for ten years

04:27.223 --> 04:28.790
'and then suddenly..'

04:28.877 --> 04:30.487
'...she's not even coming.'

04:30.574 --> 04:31.967
'Jenny?'

04:32.054 --> 04:33.142
'Jenny?'

04:33.229 --> 04:35.187
Why don't you volunteer?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.538
Uh, well, Blair's lead deb

04:37.625 --> 04:39.366
and we're sort of on the outs.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.759
You know, I'm sure if she wanted
my help she would've asked.

04:41.846 --> 04:44.632
Well, I'm asking.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.503
I mean, of course,
we'd have to get

04:46.590 --> 04:48.375
your parents' permission first.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.899
But, um, we could use more help.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.117
I'm sure it'll be fine.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.771
Um, see you Saturday.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.469
Oh, actually, it's Sunday.

04:55.556 --> 04:56.948
Uh..

04:57.035 --> 04:58.080
...can I call you?

04:58.167 --> 04:59.299
Okay.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.517
Okay.

05:02.954 --> 05:07.002
Ah. There is my
magnificent granddaughter.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.395
- 'Grandma!'
- Oh!

05:08.482 --> 05:10.875
[both chuckling]

05:12.399 --> 05:13.617
Oh, hello, mother.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.838
Is there a bar in this place?

05:16.925 --> 05:18.579
[gasps]
No.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.581
I should have known I had
to bring the party myself.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.325
So. This must be Daniel.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.152
Dan, actually,
Dan Humphrey, yeah. Hi.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.502
My granddaughter told me that

05:28.589 --> 05:30.330
you were delighted
when she decided

05:30.417 --> 05:32.984
uh, not to make
her debut this weekend?

05:33.071 --> 05:34.203
Yeah, go ahead,
tell her what you think.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.813
Grandma loves honesty.
It's okay.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.426
Well, cotillions just
seem antiquated to me.

05:39.513 --> 05:40.992
You know, remnant
of a different age.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.212
Well. Do go on.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.648
People spend all this money
to have their daughters

05:44.735 --> 05:46.476
basically dance in front
of others for attention.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.609
Uh, when, if you ask Serena

05:48.696 --> 05:50.828
I bet she'd do that for you
right now, free of charge.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.830
The cotillion teaches
the good graces

05:52.917 --> 05:55.137
that women should always
have in their arsenal.

05:55.224 --> 05:58.140
Oh, I think Serena's graces
are pretty spectacular.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.533
Ah!

05:59.620 --> 06:01.143
Aw. Besides, grandma,
you haven't used

06:01.230 --> 06:02.187
your graces in a while, I bet.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.625
[chuckles]

06:06.888 --> 06:09.064
- Isn't she great?
- She's ...she's great.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.370
She's something.

It's my pin.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.461
What? What the hell are you
doing with Carter Baizen?

19:18.548 --> 19:20.071
He left his jacket
here yesterday

19:20.159 --> 19:23.292
and I'd rather you be gone
when he got here.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.164
There's been enough
scenes for today.

19:26.643 --> 19:27.731
[instrumental music]

19:32.649 --> 19:34.477
[glasses clink]

19:34.564 --> 19:36.349
So, I see it's true
what they say

19:36.436 --> 19:38.742
about the apple and the tree.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.396
Hello, Celia.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.006
I'd say it's nice to see you

19:42.093 --> 19:44.270
but I know
how you hate dishonesty.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.794
It appears that your son
is taking my granddaughter

19:46.881 --> 19:49.492
to the ball tonight.

19:49.579 --> 19:50.624
He is?

19:50.711 --> 19:53.496
I'd rather see that not happen.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.629
There's no point in being
presented if it's improperly

19:55.716 --> 19:59.720
and your Daniel is nota proper
companion for a girl like

19:59.807 --> 20:04.115
Serena. He's a, um...
temporary distraction.

20:05.508 --> 20:08.685
I need her to focus
on her future.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.516
'Hers or yours?'

20:13.603 --> 20:16.432
I am willing to purchase
all the paintings

20:16.519 --> 20:18.217
in this gallery
in exchange for you

20:18.304 --> 20:22.699
convincing your son
not to accompany Serena.

20:22.786 --> 20:26.355
Before you answer, remember,
a grown man with children

20:26.442 --> 20:29.663
is in a very different
position than a young man.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.882
The money could be useful now.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.320
Not to mention, how much
this sale would mean

20:34.407 --> 20:36.626
to your wife's career
as an artist.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.673
[sighs]

20:39.760 --> 20:42.719
Your money...was no good
for me then..

20:44.155 --> 20:47.071
...and it's still
no good with me now.

20:47.158 --> 20:50.510
And you can rest assured that
like me, my son can't be bought.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.948
And I can assure you,
just like her mother

20:54.035 --> 20:55.210
my granddaughter can be.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.385
What do you mean?

20:56.472 --> 20:58.605
All those years ago I told Lily

20:58.692 --> 21:01.260
to choose between you
and her inheritance.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.001
I'd tell you
the end of that story

21:04.088 --> 21:07.266
but...I think
you know it by heart.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.443
[instrumental music]

21:19.321 --> 21:20.975
You're a little overdressed for
an art show, don't you think?

21:21.062 --> 21:23.630
Dad, listen. Um, I've been
meaning to tell you. I'm sorry.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.022
Don't worry about your mom.
I'll take care of it.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.763
- You don't mind?
- No.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.548
I thought I'd be grounded
when you found out

21:28.635 --> 21:31.942
just like Jenny was. I gotta
admit, it would be worth it.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.336
I don't mind at all. Mm.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.207
Tux looks great.
Shoes look great.

21:37.774 --> 21:40.124
You look so great.
You're gonna make me proud.

21:40.211 --> 21:43.693
Show that Celia Rhodes what us
Humphrey men are made of.

21:43.780 --> 21:44.868
What's going on here, dad?

21:44.955 --> 21:46.305
You're-you're doing
that thing again

21:46.392 --> 21:47.393
where you're acting
really weird for no reason.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.309
It's kind of freaking me out.

21:50.396 --> 21:54.269
Oh, uh...Serena's grandmother
just came to see me.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.317
Um..

21:59.579 --> 22:01.102
...we need to talk.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.890
Have you seen Serena's
presentation statement?

22:06.977 --> 22:08.631
Wants to take
a year off of school

22:08.718 --> 22:10.285
teach English in South Asia?

22:10.372 --> 22:11.808
This simply won't suffice.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.332
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

22:13.419 --> 22:14.550
Well, if Serena's doing this
for me

22:14.637 --> 22:16.291
it has to be right.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.249
Besides it took me
years to restore

22:18.337 --> 22:20.382
our family name
after your exploits.

22:20.469 --> 22:23.167
Trust me, you don't
want to do the same.

[instrumental music]

22:35.136 --> 22:37.007
[cell phone ringing]

22:39.270 --> 22:40.881
- Hello?
- Hey, volunteer.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.057
Where are you? You were supposed
to be here half an hour ago.

22:43.144 --> 22:46.147
Oh, um, didn't your mom tell you
I'm not coming anymore?

22:46.234 --> 22:48.236
What? I-I don't understand.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.456
I thought that this was,
like, your dream.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.154
'Besides, don't you wanna
see your brother in a tux?'

22:53.241 --> 22:55.286
- Wait. What?
- You know, your brother Dan.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.376
The guy who thinks
dancing is making fists

22:57.463 --> 22:58.899
and pumping 'em into the air?

22:58.986 --> 23:00.770
- Dan's going to the ball?
- Yeah. We..

23:00.857 --> 23:02.598
It-it was just
a last minute thing.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.470
'I'm sure he just
forgot to tell you.'

23:04.557 --> 23:06.646
Um...I'm on my way.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.087
[instrumental music]

23:36.806 --> 23:38.417
Hey!

23:39.722 --> 23:41.898
Wow-wow.
You look incredible.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.422
Thank you.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.864
- You're early.
- Well, uh, yeah.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.779
- We need to talk.
- What's up?

23:52.866 --> 23:54.041
Is your grandmother here?
Where is she?

23:54.128 --> 23:55.129
Oh, yeah, she's in
the other room

23:55.216 --> 23:56.435
getting ready with my mom. Why?

23:56.522 --> 23:58.437
I gotta be honest
about something here.

23:58.524 --> 24:01.614
Um...I don't think

24:01.701 --> 24:03.093
your grandmother is who
you think she is.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.008
- What are you talking about?
- I know.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.401
She's got the whole
free spirit act perfected.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.055
Act?

24:08.142 --> 24:11.188
But I don't think she has your
best interests at heart.

24:11.275 --> 24:14.061
Where are you going
with this, Dan?

24:14.148 --> 24:15.584
She came by my dad's
gallery today.

24:15.671 --> 24:16.629
Well, she probably just wanted

24:16.716 --> 24:17.934
to see your mom's art.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.153
No, she was trying
to buy him off

24:19.240 --> 24:20.154
so I wouldn't go
with you tonight.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.372
No.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.722
She wouldn't do
something like that.

24:22.809 --> 24:23.897
Serena, that's what I'm trying
to tell you.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.203
That woman is the most

24:26.290 --> 24:28.684
manipulative person
I've ever met.

24:28.771 --> 24:31.644
She makes your-your mother
look like Gandhi.

24:31.731 --> 24:34.603
That's my grandmother
you're talking about.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.953
- I love her.
- I know.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.998
I know and I'm so sorry

24:38.085 --> 24:40.566
but maybe you love her so much..

24:40.653 --> 24:42.611
...that you can't see
what she's doing.

24:44.265 --> 24:47.094
Damn.. I said it. There.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.443

Maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.150
Maybe we shouldn't.

Um, I'll just talk to you later.

'He's got everyone fooled.'

25:37.579 --> 25:40.451
Blair thinks he's reformed.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.932
He's obviously just toying
with her to get at you.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.368
Yeah, well, it's working.

25:44.455 --> 25:45.544
We just need to wait
until we can get him

25:45.631 --> 25:47.241
in a public place where everyone

25:47.328 --> 25:48.938
'who thinks he's changed'

25:49.025 --> 25:50.200
can see the truth.

25:52.246 --> 25:55.510
And we can get him back for
everything he's done to you..

25:55.597 --> 25:56.946
...and everything
he's doing to Blair.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.905

gonna happen, huh?

- Maybe Jenny can help you.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.938
Serena, uh, Miss Erlich
needs to know how to pronounce

26:32.025 --> 26:33.461
'that word in your
presentation statement.'

26:33.548 --> 26:35.245
I assume it's a family name.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.946
Hey, beautiful. What's wrong?

26:40.033 --> 26:42.339
I didn't write this.
My mother did.

"Serena hopes to continue
to live on the Upper East Side

- Serena, where's Dan?

- Here you go.

to see you.

put the past behind the past.

what goes on here.

with me for grounding her
