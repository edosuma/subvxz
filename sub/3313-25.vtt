WEBVTT

00:07.888 --> 00:09.679
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.761
WHY'D YOU GET ME UP SO EARLY?

00:11.762 --> 00:13.933
SHH! YOU'VE GOT TO
BE QUIET AND LEAVE

00:13.934 --> 00:15.935
BEFORE JOE OR MY
AUNT MEL SEES YOU.

00:15.936 --> 00:17.767
WHY? YOU'RE AN ADULT, RIGHT?

00:17.768 --> 00:19.689
OTHERWISE I'M IN A
LOT OF TROUBLE.

00:19.690 --> 00:20.940
NO, IT'S JUST

00:20.941 --> 00:22.442
JOE WILL GLARE AT US,

00:22.443 --> 00:25.105
AUNT MEL WILL ASK FOR
"DETAILS, GIRLFRIEND,"

00:25.106 --> 00:27.567
AND SHE DOESN'T NEED TO
KNOW ALL THE DETAILS.

00:27.568 --> 00:29.949
WHAT? LIKE THAT I'M YOUR
TEACHING ASSISTANT?

00:29.950 --> 00:31.951
YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF A BIGGIE.

00:31.952 --> 00:34.534
LENNOX, COME ON.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.656
I MEAN, AS LONG AS THE
DEAN DOESN'T FIND OUT.

00:36.657 --> 00:39.329
OKAY, LESS TALKING,
MORE LEAVING, PLEASE.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.501
WELL, HEY, ANYTIME YOU WANT
TO STAY OVER AT MY PLACE,

00:41.502 --> 00:43.964
YOU'RE WELCOME. VERY
WELCOME IN FACT.

00:48.929 --> 00:51.431
( clears throat )

00:51.432 --> 00:52.842
MORNING.

00:52.843 --> 00:55.175
HI, JOE. EMERSON JUST
GOT HERE RIGHT NOW,

00:55.176 --> 00:56.556
THIS MORNING TO PICK ME UP.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.729
OH. WHY'S HE CARRYING HIS SHOES?

00:59.980 --> 01:03.773
BECAUSE HE HATES
TO TRACK IN MUD.

01:03.774 --> 01:05.485
FROM YOUR BEDROOM?

01:05.486 --> 01:06.946
GOOD MORNING.

01:06.947 --> 01:08.488
OH, HI, EMERSON.

01:08.489 --> 01:10.070
TALK LATER, GIRLFRIEND.

01:11.742 --> 01:12.742
YOU DON'T HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH THIS?

01:12.743 --> 01:14.073
DO YOU HAVE NO RULES AT ALL?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.405
JOE, CHILL.

01:15.406 --> 01:17.747
SHE'S IN COLLEGE. SHE'S NOT
A LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE.

01:17.748 --> 01:19.829
OH!

01:19.830 --> 01:21.331
NO, DON'T!

01:21.332 --> 01:23.204
YOU SHOULDN'T BEND
OVER IN HEELS.

01:25.045 --> 01:26.046
DON'T WORRY. WE'RE GOT THEM.

01:27.918 --> 01:31.301
WHY DO YOU HAVE LIKE 60
PHILOSOPHY EXAMS IN YOUR BAG?

01:31.302 --> 01:32.762
BECAUSE I'M...

01:32.763 --> 01:34.214
RECYCLING PAPER.

01:34.215 --> 01:35.925
YOU'RE GRADING THESE.

01:35.926 --> 01:38.017
IT SAYS THAT YOU'RE THE
TEACHING ASSISTANT.

01:38.018 --> 01:39.018
WAIT, LENNOX,

01:39.019 --> 01:40.681
YOU'RE DATING YOUR T.A.?

01:41.852 --> 01:44.023
KINDA.

01:44.024 --> 01:45.935
I THINK WE JUST FOUND
OUT WHAT'S UP...

01:45.936 --> 01:48.278
GIRLFRIEND.

01:48.279 --> 01:49.689
( theme music playing )

01:49.690 --> 01:52.732
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

01:52.733 --> 01:54.735
♪ WITH ME ♪

01:57.738 --> 01:59.078
SEE YOU IN CLASS. OH, HEADS UP.

01:59.079 --> 02:00.330
POP QUIZ TODAY.

02:00.331 --> 02:03.244
OKAY, NOT HELPING. BYE.

02:04.745 --> 02:06.005
YOU KNOW,

02:06.006 --> 02:08.918
I THOUGHT I MENTIONED
THAT EMERSON WAS MY T.A.

02:08.919 --> 02:11.090
SO, THE PERSON SLEEPING
OVER IN YOUR BEDROOM

02:11.091 --> 02:12.552
IS ALSO GRADING YOUR TESTS?

02:12.553 --> 02:14.964
( chuckles ) WHAT A
SMALL WORLD, HUH?

02:14.965 --> 02:16.756
OH, COME ON.

02:16.757 --> 02:18.518
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S
THE PROFESSOR.

02:18.519 --> 02:21.761
NO NO NO. HE'S JUST
THE PROFESSOR LIGHT.

02:21.762 --> 02:24.143
NOW WITH ONLY HALF
THE CREEPINESS.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.856
SEE, THIS IS WHY I
DIDN'T TELL YOU GUYS.

02:26.857 --> 02:28.768
I KNEW YOU'D BE ALL
JUDGEY AND WEIRD.

02:28.769 --> 02:30.149
NO, HE'S JUDGEY AND WEIRD.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.982
I'M JUST LETTING THIS NEW
INFORMATION WASH OVER ME

02:32.983 --> 02:34.944
LIKE A SPRING RAIN.

02:34.945 --> 02:36.576
LENNOX, SERIOUSLY,

02:36.577 --> 02:38.037
ALL THREE OF US NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

02:38.038 --> 02:40.079
ACTUALLY, I GOTTA GET TO CLASS.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.081
YOU'RE WEARING YOUR PAJAMAS.

02:42.082 --> 02:44.995
IT'S INCREDIBLY CASUAL TUESDAY.
SEE YOU!

02:48.589 --> 02:49.999
SO YOU'RE REALLY
OKAY WITH ALL THIS?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.791
WELL, I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT THE SITUATION.

02:51.792 --> 02:53.213
ALL RIGHT, THEN LET'S PUT A
STOP TO IT RIGHT NOW THEN.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.094
IT'S NOT AS CUT AND
DRY AS THAT, JOE.

02:55.095 --> 02:57.347
IF I FORBID LENNOX
FROM SEEING EMERSON,

02:57.348 --> 02:58.678
SHE'LL JUST SEE HIM
BEHIND MY BACK,

02:58.679 --> 02:59.929
- SO WHAT'S THE POINT?
- THE POINT IS

02:59.930 --> 03:01.681
IT'S ETHICALLY KIND OF SKETCHY.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.514
ALL RIGHT? COME ON. THIS IS...
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE.

03:04.515 --> 03:06.226
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO FORBID
THAT GUY FROM COMING HERE.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.897
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
- I CAN HEAR THAT LITTLE VOICE

03:07.898 --> 03:09.439
INSIDE YOUR HEAD. YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S SAYING RIGHT NOW?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.110
IT'S SAYING...

03:11.111 --> 03:14.153
"THAT NO GOOD LOWLIFE AIN'T
WELCOME IN THIS HOUSE."

03:14.154 --> 03:16.986
OKAY, WHY DOES MY LITTLE
VOICE SOUND LIKE JOE PESCI?

03:16.987 --> 03:19.739
"COME ON, MEL. JUST LET
ME OUT, ALL RIGHT?

03:19.740 --> 03:22.662
LET ME JUST TELL THAT
PUNK KID HOW IT IS."

03:22.663 --> 03:23.993
ALL RIGHT, FINE. I'LL TELL HER,

03:23.994 --> 03:26.086
BUT JUST TO GET THAT
VOICE TO SHUT UP.

03:29.039 --> 03:32.922
( computer dings )

03:32.923 --> 03:35.675
HEY, RYDER. HOW'S MONTREAL, EH?

03:35.676 --> 03:37.176
It's great.

03:37.177 --> 03:38.678
Except for one little thing.

03:38.679 --> 03:41.681
I'm not there, and I kind
of forgot my passport.

03:41.682 --> 03:44.934
OKAY, THAT'S TWO THINGS,
AND THEY'RE NOT LITTLE.

03:44.935 --> 03:47.607
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- I'm in a hotel right by the border.

03:47.608 --> 03:50.109
I can actually see Canada
from the bathroom.

03:50.110 --> 03:53.022
Anyway, I'm here
with a chaperone.

03:53.023 --> 03:54.274
She stayed behind to watch me.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.116
I think she's somebody's mom.

03:56.907 --> 03:59.320
I'm your homeroom teacher.

04:00.321 --> 04:02.912
Oh. Yeah, you are.

04:02.913 --> 04:05.995
SO YOU'RE MISSING THE TRIP?
THAT'S AWFUL.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.077
Hey, listen, do you think
you could find my passport

04:08.078 --> 04:09.709
and maybe drive it up here

04:09.710 --> 04:12.081
so I can meet up with the
rest of my French class?

04:12.082 --> 04:14.504
RYDER, YOU'VE REALLY
GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB

04:14.505 --> 04:16.255
ABOUT REMEMBERING THESE THINGS.
WHERE DID YOU LEAVE IT?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.758
I think it's in the
shoebox under my bed,

04:18.759 --> 04:20.800
but don't look at anything
else under there.

04:20.801 --> 04:22.051
TRUST ME, I DON'T WANT TO.

04:22.052 --> 04:23.843
And if it's not there,

04:23.844 --> 04:25.935
it's probably somewhere
else in my room...

04:25.936 --> 04:28.097
or downstairs.

04:28.098 --> 04:29.849
I definitely remember
seeing it on a flat surface

04:29.850 --> 04:33.443
like a table or a desk
or possibly the ground.

04:33.444 --> 04:36.065
GOOD. 'CAUSE THAT
RULES OUT NOTHING.

04:36.066 --> 04:37.567
- ( knocks on door )
- OH.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.898
THANKS, AUNT MEL. I GOTTA GO.

04:38.899 --> 04:40.660
THE FOOD GUY'S HERE.
YOU DIAL A NUMBER

04:40.661 --> 04:42.322
AND THEY BRING WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO THE ROOM.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.904
- I GOT STEAK.
- Mel: No no no!

04:47.328 --> 04:49.118
HEY THERE, LENNIE.

04:49.119 --> 04:50.119
OH, HI.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.911
HEY, SO DID ANYBODY
TEASE YOU TODAY

04:51.912 --> 04:53.673
ABOUT WEARING YOUR PAJAMAS?

04:53.674 --> 04:55.505
ARE YOU KIDDING? THIS IS
DRESSED UP FOR MY SCHOOL.

04:55.506 --> 04:57.677
AT LEAST I'M WEARING BOTTOMS.

04:57.678 --> 04:59.089
( laughing )

05:01.301 --> 05:03.182
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LITTLE BIT

05:03.183 --> 05:05.094
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH EMERSON.

05:05.095 --> 05:06.596
OH, HAVE YOU NOW?

05:06.597 --> 05:09.769
YEAH, I'M SURE HE HAS
SOME VERY GOOD POINTS.

05:09.770 --> 05:13.022
I MEAN, HE REALLY ROCKS
THAT FANCY MAN BAG.

05:13.023 --> 05:16.526
BUT I'M JUST SNAGGING ON
THIS ONE MINOR NEGATIVE

05:16.527 --> 05:18.938
THAT HE'S YOUR
TEACHING ASSISTANT.

05:18.939 --> 05:22.742
TRUE, BUT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP,
WE'RE EQUALS, YOU KNOW?

05:22.743 --> 05:24.323
HE RESPECTS ME.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.905
HE SAYS HE'S NEVER
HAD A FRESHMAN

05:25.906 --> 05:28.998
GRASP WITTGENSTEIN THE WAY I DO.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.370
IS THAT WHAT HE CALLS HIS...

05:30.371 --> 05:31.951
WITTGENSTEIN'S A PHILOSOPHER.

05:31.952 --> 05:33.042
OH.

05:33.043 --> 05:34.754
HONEY, COME ON. LET'S FACE IT.

05:34.755 --> 05:37.216
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO
BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

05:37.217 --> 05:39.759
IT'S LIKE DATING YOUR BOSS.
IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.171
RIGHT, LIKE WHEN JOE
STARTED DATING HIS BOSS.

05:42.172 --> 05:45.344
WHO WAS THAT AGAIN?
OH, RIGHT. YOU.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.766
NO NO.

05:46.767 --> 05:48.347
WE HAD SEX WHILE I WAS HIS BOSS.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.099
TECHNICALLY WE DIDN'T START
DATING UNTIL AFTER HE QUIT.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.811
SO THERE.

05:51.812 --> 05:54.183
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, AUNT MEL.

05:54.184 --> 05:55.935
HONEY, YOU'RE ONLY 18.

05:55.936 --> 05:58.317
I'M JUST TRYING TO
LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

05:58.318 --> 06:01.190
LOOK, I KNOW I CAN'T TELL
YOU TO STOP SEEING EMERSON,

06:01.191 --> 06:03.653
BUT YOU DO LIVE UNDER MY ROOF,

06:03.654 --> 06:05.825
AND I'M JUST NOT
VERY COMFORTABLE

06:05.826 --> 06:07.577
WITH HIM COMING
OVER TO THE HOUSE.

06:07.578 --> 06:08.868
YOU'RE BANNING HIM?

06:08.869 --> 06:12.041
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO HARSH, BUT YES.

06:12.042 --> 06:14.994
OKAY, WELL, I'M GLAD WE
HAD THIS LITTLE TALK.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.336
AND HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THOSE SHOES YOU BORROWED,

06:17.337 --> 06:19.208
KEEP THEM. THEY
LOOK GREAT ON YOU.

06:19.209 --> 06:21.501
WAIT, WHAT? I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

06:21.502 --> 06:23.673
OH, NO. I HAVE LOTS OF SHOES.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.675
NO, THIS THING WITH EMERSON.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.468
OKAY, I'M AN ADULT.
YOU CAN'T CONTROL ME.

06:28.469 --> 06:30.970
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU'RE GONNA
BAN EMERSON FROM THE HOUSE,

06:30.971 --> 06:32.472
THEN I'M BANNING
YOU FROM MY ROOM.

06:32.473 --> 06:35.515
WHICH IS TECHNICALLY
STILL PART OF MY HOUSE,

06:35.516 --> 06:37.356
BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU
HOW GENEROUS I AM,

06:37.357 --> 06:40.480
I AM GONNA LEAVE RIGHT
NOW OF MY OWN FREE WILL.

06:40.481 --> 06:42.902
NO, FINE, I GET IT. I
HAVE NO RIGHTS HERE.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.656
YOUR HOUSE, YOUR RULES.

06:46.737 --> 06:47.908
GOOD TALK, HONEY.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.911
I DID IT.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.624
SO YOU FINALLY PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN.
WAY TO GO, MELLY.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.035
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE I NEVER DO.

06:56.036 --> 06:57.497
YOU NEVER DO.

06:57.498 --> 06:58.918
I HATED SEEING HER LIKE THAT,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.630
ANGRY AND YELLING AT ME.

07:00.631 --> 07:02.922
HONEY, ANGRY AND YELLING IS
ALL PART OF GOOD PARENTING.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.505
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU HIT
THE PARENTAL SWEET SPOT.

07:05.506 --> 07:07.927
IT DID FEEL KIND OF GOOD
TO LAY DOWN THE LAW.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.178
I BET IT DID.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.600
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE
MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

07:10.601 --> 07:12.723
I DISPENSE THE WISDOM,
AND YOU EXECUTE...

07:14.104 --> 07:15.765
YOU KNOW, THE BEST THAT YOU CAN.

07:15.766 --> 07:17.857
NO, IT WASN'T YOUR
WISDOM THAT HELPED ME.

07:17.858 --> 07:19.859
I HAD A COUPLE GLASSES
OF WINE FIRST.

07:19.860 --> 07:21.481
ALCOHOL-BASED PARENTING.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.982
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE BOOK, HONEY.

07:22.983 --> 07:24.323
HERE SHE IS.

07:24.324 --> 07:25.985
ALL RIGHT, WELL LOOK, I'LL
BE HERE IF YOU NEED ME.

07:25.986 --> 07:27.066
OH, NO, IT'S OKAY.

07:27.067 --> 07:29.069
I HAVE HALF A BOTTLE
OF ADVICE LEFT.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.492
- HEY THERE, SWEETIE.
- HEY, AUNT MEL.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.664
LISTEN, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

07:34.665 --> 07:36.836
ABOUT HOW IT'S YOUR HOUSE
AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

07:36.837 --> 07:37.917
TO MAKE YOUR OWN RULES,

07:37.918 --> 07:39.919
AND I RESPECT THAT.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.423
WOW. I AM IMPRESSED AT HOW
CALM AND MATURE YOU'RE ACTING.

07:44.424 --> 07:46.756
YEAH, SO I TALKED IT
OVER WITH EMERSON...

07:46.757 --> 07:48.848
- GREAT.
- ...AND I DECIDED TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

07:48.849 --> 07:51.721
OH, I'M SO PROUD OF...
YOU WHAT?!

07:51.722 --> 07:53.302
SEE YOU.

07:53.303 --> 07:54.764
BUT...

07:54.765 --> 07:56.145
BUT... ( stammers )

07:56.146 --> 07:58.938
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

07:58.939 --> 08:01.942
COME ON, I HIT THE
PARENTAL SWEET SPOT.

08:07.407 --> 08:09.408
24 POINTS, BABY.

08:09.409 --> 08:10.610
NEW PERSONAL BEST.

08:10.611 --> 08:13.573
I KNOW BASKETBALL'S A
TEAM EFFORT, HONEY,

08:13.574 --> 08:15.034
BUT I REALLY CARRIED THEM.

08:15.035 --> 08:16.996
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.417
SO LENNOX MOVED OUT.

08:18.418 --> 08:19.879
OH, THAT'S... SHE WHAT?!

08:19.880 --> 08:21.500
YEAH, SHE PACKED
UP ALL HER THINGS

08:21.501 --> 08:22.712
AND MOVED IN WITH HER T.A.

08:22.713 --> 08:23.833
HOW COULD YOU JUST
LET THIS HAPPEN?

08:23.834 --> 08:25.585
OH, LET'S SEE, BECAUSE
I LISTENED TO YOU

08:25.586 --> 08:27.427
AND JOE PESCI?

08:28.428 --> 08:30.429
SO, WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

08:30.430 --> 08:32.301
I HAVE NO POWER TO
GET HER BACK NOW.

08:32.302 --> 08:34.844
YOU HAVE ALL THE POWER. YOU PAY
FOR EVERYTHING IN HER LIFE.

08:34.845 --> 08:36.095
YOU COULD JUST STOP DOING THAT.

08:36.096 --> 08:38.017
HUH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.599
- YEAH, I PAY FOR HER TUITION...
- MM-HMM.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.940
- ...HER CREDIT CARDS...
- YEP.

08:40.941 --> 08:44.063
- ...HER BIRTH CONTROL.
- THAT'S... YOU WHAT?

08:44.064 --> 08:45.985
HER TUITION AND CREDIT CARDS.

08:45.986 --> 08:47.406
UM, WAIT.

08:47.407 --> 08:48.568
BUT IF WE CUT HER OFF,

08:48.569 --> 08:50.149
THEN SHE'LL JUST BE
A COLLEGE DROPOUT

08:50.150 --> 08:51.781
LIVING WITH A BOYFRIEND
WE DON'T LIKE.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.452
NO PLAN IS PERFECT.

08:53.453 --> 08:54.574
OR HOW ABOUT THIS.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.155
I CALL HER RIGHT
NOW AND TELL HER

08:56.156 --> 08:57.997
EMERSON IS WELCOME HERE
ANYTIME SHE WANTS.

08:57.998 --> 09:00.119
WHAT? THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.581
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.713
I'LL TEXT HER. KIDS RESPOND
MUCH BETTER TO THAT.

09:03.714 --> 09:05.925
GIVE ME THIS. I'M TAKING
YOUR PHONE AWAY FROM YOU,

09:05.926 --> 09:07.927
'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO NUKE THE WHOLE
POWER STRUCTURE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD.

09:07.928 --> 09:09.799
STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.761
NOW GIVE ME MY PHONE BEFORE
WE LOSE OUR PRECIOUS LENNOX

09:11.762 --> 09:13.052
FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER!

09:13.053 --> 09:15.384
MEL, LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO
STAND FIRM HERE, OKAY?

09:15.385 --> 09:16.976
I WILL STAND FIRM WITH MY PHONE!

09:16.977 --> 09:18.437
WILL YOU STOP IT? LOOK, LENNOX

09:18.438 --> 09:19.679
RAN AWAY FROM HERE
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.601
YOU CAN'T REWARD THAT
KIND OF BEHAVIOR

09:21.602 --> 09:23.683
BY CAVING. YOU GOTTA
WAIT AT LEAST 24 HOURS

09:23.684 --> 09:25.524
OR ELSE YOU'RE GONNA SEEM
DESPERATE AND PATHETIC.

09:25.525 --> 09:27.566
OKAY, FINE. I'LL
WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.739
- PHONE PLEASE?
- IF I GIVE THIS BACK TO YOU,

09:29.740 --> 09:30.740
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CALL
LENNOX WITH IT, ARE YOU?

09:30.741 --> 09:32.071
NO. I'M GONNA FINISH

09:32.072 --> 09:33.954
A VERY IMPORTANT
GAME OF CANDY CRUSH.

09:37.367 --> 09:39.158
WELL OF COURSE ON A META LEVEL

09:39.159 --> 09:42.161
PLAYING TO AN AUDIENCE IS A
REFLECTION OF MODERN SOCIETY.

09:42.162 --> 09:43.623
YEAH, NO ONE'S DISPUTING THAT,

09:43.624 --> 09:45.044
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE
ACCUSTOMED TO CONSTANT

09:45.045 --> 09:47.166
BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION TO
CREATE AN IMAGE OF OURSELVES

09:47.167 --> 09:48.337
FOR SOCIAL MEDIA.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.880
YEAH, TOTALLY.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.591
THIS IS AWESOME. YOU KNOW,
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN TO

09:52.592 --> 09:55.014
TALK LIKE THIS ABOUT
"HUNGER GAMES" BEFORE.

09:55.015 --> 09:57.016
WELL, THE WHOLE THING'S
A RIP-OFF OF FUKASAKU'S

09:57.017 --> 09:58.057
"BATORU ROWAIARU."

09:58.058 --> 10:00.519
YEAH. WHO DOESN'T KNOW THAT?

10:00.520 --> 10:02.601
BRILLIANT IDEA. LET'S
WATCH THAT RIGHT NOW.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.183
- YEAH.
- OH, GOSH.

10:04.184 --> 10:06.646
YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO,

10:06.647 --> 10:07.987
BUT IT'S ALMOST 2:00 A.M.
AND I HAVE

10:07.988 --> 10:10.149
AN EARLY SEMINAR TOMORROW,
SO I'D BETTER SAY NO.

10:10.150 --> 10:13.572
BUT YOU GUYS HAVE FUN
WATCHING FUKASAKU'S...

10:13.573 --> 10:15.035
"BABA BOOEY."

10:16.576 --> 10:18.077
OH, LENNOX, JUST A HEADS UP,

10:18.078 --> 10:19.909
JAMES TENDS TO CRANK
IT UP PRETTY LOUD.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.330
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SLEEP THROUGH THAT?

10:21.331 --> 10:22.912
OH, UH, YEAH.

10:22.913 --> 10:26.125
NO, THAT'S COOL. I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE A SHOWER BEFORE BED.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.128
( music blaring )

10:29.129 --> 10:31.131
YEAH, I CAN TOTALLY
SLEEP THROUGH THAT.

10:32.592 --> 10:34.675
( whistling )

10:46.857 --> 10:48.689
- ( chirping )
- ( yelps )

10:50.400 --> 10:52.151
Emerson: EVERYTHING
OKAY IN THERE?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.232
YEAH.

10:53.233 --> 10:54.904
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.485
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ACTUALLY I DECIDED

10:56.486 --> 10:58.407
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE
A SHOWER TONIGHT.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.741
SHOWERS ARE SUCH A
WASTE OF WATER.

11:01.742 --> 11:03.542
Emerson: FEEL FREE
TO TAKE A BATH.

11:03.543 --> 11:05.494
NO.

11:05.495 --> 11:06.747
( shudders )

11:09.589 --> 11:11.841
HEY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY RYDER NEEDS A PASSPORT.

11:11.842 --> 11:14.173
I MEAN, IT'S JUST CANADA.
CAN'T YOU JUST WRITE A NOTE

11:14.174 --> 11:16.175
SAYING "YO, CANADA,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.346
MY NEPHEW WANTS TO COME
INTO YOUR COUNTRY.

11:17.347 --> 11:18.427
YOU COOL?"

11:18.428 --> 11:20.429
THIS IS THE LAST THING
I'M DOING FOR HIM.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.680
YOU KNOW, YOU RAISE THESE KIDS

11:21.681 --> 11:23.602
AND THEY GIVE YOU NOTHING
BACK, NO APPRECIATION.

11:23.603 --> 11:24.854
HE BETTER NOT NEED A KIDNEY,

11:24.855 --> 11:25.975
BECAUSE I'M KEEPING
BOTH OF MINE.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.977
WITH THE AMOUNT
YOU DRINK, HONEY,

11:27.978 --> 11:29.108
THAT'S A VERY SMART MOVE.

11:29.109 --> 11:31.400
YOU KNOW WHAT? SHUT THE BOX.

11:31.401 --> 11:33.072
JUST FORGET ABOUT THE PASSPORT.

11:33.073 --> 11:34.693
- HE'S ON HIS OWN.
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.155
LOOK WHAT I JUST FOUND.

11:36.156 --> 11:38.157
YOU KNOW THAT ANNOYING THING
YOU DO EVERY THANKSGIVING?

11:38.158 --> 11:40.619
SET FIRE TO THE BISCUITS?

11:40.620 --> 11:42.661
NO, WE ALL LOOK FORWARD
TO THAT, SWEETIE.

11:42.662 --> 11:45.244
NO, THAT THING YOU MAKE US DO.

11:45.245 --> 11:47.666
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU MAKE US WRITE THE
LIST OF EVERYTHING WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR?

11:47.667 --> 11:49.999
I JUST FOUND RYDER'S
FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.383
LISTEN TO THIS. "THINGS
I'M 'GRATFUL' FOR."

11:54.384 --> 11:56.385
I DON'T CARE WHAT
THAT LIST SAYS.

11:56.386 --> 11:57.596
YEAH? LISTEN TO THIS.

11:57.597 --> 12:01.891
"I'M 'GRATFUL' FOR MY
AUNT MEL AND JOE."

12:01.892 --> 12:03.302
WHAT?

12:03.303 --> 12:04.643
YOU MADE THAT UP.

12:04.644 --> 12:06.766
AWW.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.017
YEAH.

12:08.018 --> 12:11.110
AND HE PUT US ABOVE
NACHOS AND MEGAN FOX.

12:11.111 --> 12:13.562
HE'S A GOOD KID.

12:13.563 --> 12:14.774
HE IS.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.905
NOW LET'S JUST KEEP
LOOKING THROUGH HIS CRAP

12:15.906 --> 12:17.277
AND HOPE THERE'S
NOTHING DEAD IN HERE.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.532
( clatters )

12:23.743 --> 12:25.324
LENNOX?

12:25.325 --> 12:27.076
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK HOME?

12:27.077 --> 12:28.367
NOTHING.

12:28.368 --> 12:29.708
DID YOU JUST TAKE A SHOWER?

12:29.709 --> 12:31.630
NO.

12:31.631 --> 12:34.043
- YOUR HAIR'S WET.
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.876
MY HAIR TOOK A LITTLE SHOWER.

12:36.877 --> 12:39.758
SO DOESN'T EMERSON HAVE
A SHOWER AT HIS PLACE?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.180
YES, HE DOES,

12:41.181 --> 12:43.762
AND IT IS AMAZING.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.684
UH-HUH.

12:44.685 --> 12:46.515
SO, WELL, I'M JUST GONNA

12:46.516 --> 12:49.979
GRAB A FEW MORE THINGS AND THEN
I WILL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY.

12:49.980 --> 12:51.650
OH, NO.

12:51.651 --> 12:54.773
I CAN'T BELIEVE I
ALMOST FORGOT YOU.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.027
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SO
FOND OF GOOD OLD "WASTEY."

12:58.028 --> 13:00.399
ANYWAY, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TALK TO YOU,

13:00.400 --> 13:02.241
'CAUSE I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT

13:02.242 --> 13:04.243
IF YOU WANTED TO
STAY HERE AND JUST

13:04.244 --> 13:06.365
HAVE EMERSON COME
OVER ONCE IN AWHILE,

13:06.366 --> 13:07.706
THAT'D BE COOL.

13:07.707 --> 13:10.619
WAIT, SO NOW THE ETHICS
DON'T BOTHER YOU ANYMORE?

13:10.620 --> 13:12.751
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT I HAVE MODIFIED

13:12.752 --> 13:14.753
MY PREVIOUSLY STATED STANCE.

13:14.754 --> 13:17.797
SO YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER
FEEL LIKE MOVING BACK.

13:18.588 --> 13:20.009
I DON'T KNOW.

13:20.010 --> 13:22.341
I'M PRETTY HAPPY AT EMERSON'S.

13:22.342 --> 13:26.185
LENNOX, YOU AND I HAD
A BAD DAY YESTERDAY,

13:26.186 --> 13:28.637
AND I... I OVERREACTED.

13:28.638 --> 13:30.850
YEAH, YOU DID.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.561
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE
I'LL STAY FOR DINNER

13:32.562 --> 13:33.732
BEFORE I GO BACK.

13:33.733 --> 13:36.565
OH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

13:36.566 --> 13:40.239
HEY, MAYBE YOU AND I COULD
BEHAVE BETTER IN THE FUTURE.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.991
YOU KNOW, I WON'T ACT
LIKE A BIG OLD MEANIE.

13:41.992 --> 13:43.402
THANK YOU.

13:43.403 --> 13:45.574
YOU WON'T ACT LIKE
A BIG OLD BABY.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.406
WHAT, YOU THINK I
ACTED LIKE A BABY?

13:47.407 --> 13:50.159
NO. NO, I MEANT SMALL CHILD.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.581
OH, YEAH. THAT'S
REAL NICE, AUNT MEL.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.623
SEE, THIS IS WHY I
MOVED TO EMERSON'S.

13:54.624 --> 13:56.625
SO I COULD BE TREATED
LIKE AN ADULT.

13:56.626 --> 13:58.587
SOMEONE WHO'S CAPABLE OF
MAKING THEIR OWN DECISIONS

13:58.588 --> 14:00.049
WITHOUT PEOPLE JUDGING THEM.

14:00.050 --> 14:02.461
I'M NOT JUDGING YOUR DECISIONS.

14:02.462 --> 14:04.723
I'M JUST SAYING YOU'RE
MAKING A TERRIBLE ONE.

14:04.724 --> 14:07.016
GOODBYE.

14:07.017 --> 14:09.098
FINE! RUN AWAY.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.599
BUT YOU CAN'T COME BACK!

14:10.600 --> 14:12.022
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

14:18.478 --> 14:20.649
I DON'T GET IT. I
COMPLETELY CAVE

14:20.650 --> 14:21.901
AND IT STILL DIDN'T WORK.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.073
NOW HOW DO WE WIN HER BACK?

14:24.074 --> 14:25.864
I'VE THOUGHT A LOT
ABOUT THIS ONE.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.447
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T
AGREE WITH LENNOX'S DECISION,

14:28.448 --> 14:31.080
WE MUST ACCEPT IT.

14:31.081 --> 14:33.162
WE'VE ALREADY LOST.

14:33.163 --> 14:36.046
WELL, THANKS FOR THE
PEP TALK, DALI LONGO.

14:37.417 --> 14:39.588
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE
WHAT THE UNIVERSE GIVES YOU

14:39.589 --> 14:41.550
AND... ACCEPT.

14:41.551 --> 14:42.841
OH, THAT'S CRAP.

14:42.842 --> 14:44.263
SHE'S LIVING WITH THAT CREEP

14:44.264 --> 14:45.264
WHO'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER.

14:45.265 --> 14:46.885
HOW CAN YOU STAY SO CALM?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.889
I'M CALM BECAUSE THERE'S
NO OTHER FREAKING CHOICE!

14:51.271 --> 14:53.312
ANGRY JOE.

14:53.313 --> 14:54.393
IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU
BACK ON THE TEAM.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.434
SO NOW, WHAT DO WE DO?

14:55.435 --> 14:56.685
WE STILL CAN'T DO ANYTHING,

14:56.686 --> 14:58.147
BUT NOW I'M ALL AGITATED.
THANKS A LOT.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.069
YOU HAPPY?

15:00.070 --> 15:01.611
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

15:06.236 --> 15:08.657
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT I DID TODAY.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.080
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

15:11.081 --> 15:13.202
YOU OPENED THE WINDOW.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

15:13.203 --> 15:15.204
TO AIR IT OUT. THERE
WERE SOME SMELLS IN HERE

15:15.205 --> 15:17.416
THAT NEEDED TO BE LET FREE.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.838
WHERE'S THE BIRD?
WHERE'S JAMES'S BIRD?

15:19.839 --> 15:21.090
HE LIVES IN THE BATHROOM.

15:21.091 --> 15:23.212
OH MY GOD. YOU LOST MARCEL!

15:23.213 --> 15:24.423
WHAT? NO.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.594
I'M SURE HE'S NOT LOST.

15:25.595 --> 15:28.427
HE JUST WENT OUT FOR
A WORM OR SOMETHING.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.009
HERE, BIRDIE BIRDIE.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.011
OH, NO. THIS IS BAD.

15:32.012 --> 15:33.602
THIS IS REALLY REALLY BAD.

15:33.603 --> 15:35.224
OKAY.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.895
LET'S NOT FREAK OUT RIGHT AWAY.

15:36.896 --> 15:38.227
NO, LENNOX, YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.649
IF YOU LOST JAMES'S BIRD,
HE'LL KICK ME OUT.

15:40.650 --> 15:43.322
HIS DAD OWNS THIS PLACE AND HE
GIVES ME A HUGE BREAK ON RENT.

15:43.323 --> 15:44.984
HOW DO YOU THINK I CAN
AFFORD THESE KILLER FRAMES

15:44.985 --> 15:46.566
AND THAT ROCKIN' MAN BAG?

15:49.069 --> 15:51.620
WELL, I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I DIDN'T KNOW.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.072
WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD HAVE ASKED.

15:53.073 --> 15:54.333
I DIDN'T REALIZE I
NEEDED PERMISSION

15:54.334 --> 15:55.784
TO SCRUB THE BATHROOM.

15:55.785 --> 15:57.416
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE BATHROOM.

15:57.417 --> 15:58.837
THIS IS ABOUT YOU
THINKING YOU CAN MOVE IN

15:58.838 --> 16:00.169
AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,

16:00.170 --> 16:01.290
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ONLY HERE

16:01.291 --> 16:03.172
BECAUSE YOU THREW A
TANTRUM AND RAN AWAY.

16:03.173 --> 16:04.963
WHOA, EXCUSE ME.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.675
I JUST CLEANED YOUR
FILTHY BATHROOM.

16:06.676 --> 16:08.847
I THINK THE WORDS YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR ARE "THANK YOU"

16:08.848 --> 16:11.090
AND "SORRY I LIVE
LIKE A DUNG BEETLE."

16:11.091 --> 16:13.682
JUST DON'T DO STUFF

16:13.683 --> 16:15.264
UNLESS I AUTHORIZE IT.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.395
AUTHORIZE?

16:16.396 --> 16:19.308
I THOUGHT WE WERE
EQUALS ON EVERY LEVEL.

16:19.309 --> 16:20.399
HARDLY!

16:20.400 --> 16:22.401
YOUR "INSIGHTS" ON WITTGENSTEIN

16:22.402 --> 16:25.444
WERE, IF ANYTHING,
SIMPLISTIC AND PEDESTRIAN.

16:25.445 --> 16:27.656
BUT YOU SAID THEY WERE
ASTUTE AND PENETRATING.

16:27.657 --> 16:29.408
I WAS TRYING TO SLEEP WITH YOU!

16:29.409 --> 16:31.070
( gasps )

16:31.071 --> 16:32.321
( chirps )

16:32.322 --> 16:34.033
MARCEL! OH, THANK GOD.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.374
HE'S BACK.

16:35.375 --> 16:36.956
( sighs )

16:38.668 --> 16:41.710
LOOK, I GUESS I LOST
MY TEMPER THERE.

16:41.711 --> 16:44.673
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE
BIRD AND THE RENT.

16:44.674 --> 16:46.295
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
SAY THOSE THINGS.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.257
NO NO.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.680
YOU KNOW, THANKS FOR SHOWING ME
WHO YOU REALLY ARE, EMERSON.

16:51.681 --> 16:54.433
GOODBYE, YOU SMUG,
PRETENTIOUS JERK.

16:54.434 --> 16:56.635
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

16:56.636 --> 16:58.227
I SAW YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE.

16:58.228 --> 17:00.230
I KNOW YOUR REAL NAME IS GARY.

17:03.813 --> 17:05.734
- Hey, Ryder.
- Hey, what's up?

17:05.735 --> 17:07.406
HEY, WE'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL
OVER FOR YOUR PASSPORT,

17:07.407 --> 17:08.697
BUT WE HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET.

17:08.698 --> 17:10.239
IT'S NOT GONNA STOP US FROM
LOOKING THOUGH, BUDDY.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.240
IT'S GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE.

17:11.241 --> 17:13.072
Yeah, I forgot to tell you guys.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.324
I found my passport.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.076
- You what?
- Yeah.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.537
Turns out it was in
the front pocket

17:18.538 --> 17:20.079
of my duffel bag the whole time.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.920
How funny is that?

17:21.921 --> 17:23.252
Dude, that's so funny.

17:23.253 --> 17:25.164
Exactly when were you
gonna tell us that?

17:25.165 --> 17:26.335
Well, I was about to
call you yesterday,

17:26.336 --> 17:28.667
but then there was a
"Walking Dead" marathon,

17:28.668 --> 17:30.259
and I just got sucked in.

17:30.260 --> 17:33.222
Did the zombie by any
chance eat your brain?

17:33.223 --> 17:35.094
( car horn honking )

17:35.095 --> 17:36.675
OH, BUS IS HERE.

17:36.676 --> 17:38.637
OKAY, GUYS.

17:38.638 --> 17:41.350
I'LL SEE YOU. BYE, THANKS.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.522
HE HAD IT THE WHOLE TIME.

17:43.523 --> 17:45.234
YOU KNOW, LENNOX MAY
HAVE MOVED OUT,

17:45.235 --> 17:47.646
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT
RYDER'S GONNA BE LIVING WITH US

17:47.647 --> 17:49.359
TILL HE'S 40-FREAKING-FIVE.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.790
JOE?

18:01.791 --> 18:03.542
LENNOX. WHAT'S WRONG?

18:03.543 --> 18:05.964
WELL, EMERSON AND I
GOT IN A BIG FIGHT

18:05.965 --> 18:07.336
AND I MOVED OUT,

18:07.337 --> 18:09.258
BUT NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

18:09.259 --> 18:11.630
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY I
CAN JUST MOVE BACK HOME.

18:11.631 --> 18:12.921
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

18:12.922 --> 18:14.263
NO, I CAN'T.

18:14.264 --> 18:16.094
I MADE A BIG DEAL
TO AUNT MEL ABOUT

18:16.095 --> 18:17.266
BEING TREATED LIKE AN ADULT.

18:17.267 --> 18:19.478
I CAN'T JUST CRAWL
BACK LIKE A BABY.

18:19.479 --> 18:21.140
HEY, LOOK, I DON'T...

18:21.141 --> 18:23.642
I DON'T WANT YOU TO CRY
WHEN I TELL YOU THIS,

18:23.643 --> 18:25.434
BUT YOU ARE A BABY.

18:25.435 --> 18:27.226
I'M 18.

18:27.227 --> 18:28.727
WHY ARE YOU COMING
TO ME ABOUT THIS?

18:28.728 --> 18:30.319
YOUR AUNT THINKS YOU'RE A
LOT MORE READY FOR THESE

18:30.320 --> 18:32.361
MATURE SITUATIONS
THAN I DO, ANYWAY.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.072
WELL, THAT'S JUST THE THING.

18:34.073 --> 18:35.654
YOU DON'T EXPECT
ME TO BE AN ADULT,

18:35.655 --> 18:38.907
SO WHEN I ACT LIKE A KID, I
HAVEN'T DISAPPOINTED YOU.

18:38.908 --> 18:40.239
THAT'S VERY PERCEPTIVE...

18:40.240 --> 18:42.000
FOR A LITTLE GIRL.

18:42.001 --> 18:43.662
THANKS.

18:43.663 --> 18:46.084
BUT WHAT DO I DO ABOUT AUNT MEL?

18:46.085 --> 18:49.248
HOW DO I CRAWL
BACK WITH DIGNITY?

18:49.249 --> 18:51.630
YOU GOT ANY IDEAS?

18:51.631 --> 18:54.253
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I'M JOE LONGO.

18:54.254 --> 18:56.385
I GOT A MILLION IDEAS.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.808
YEAH, BUT YOU GOT ANY GOOD ONES?

19:00.059 --> 19:01.060
I MIGHT HAVE ONE.

19:02.101 --> 19:03.222
- GET IN HERE.
- JOE!

19:03.223 --> 19:05.394
JOE! LET ME GO!

19:05.395 --> 19:07.226
NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

19:07.227 --> 19:09.478
I KNOW YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH
YOUR SCUMBAG BOYFRIEND,

19:09.479 --> 19:11.069
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET IT HAPPEN!

19:11.070 --> 19:12.651
I HATE YOU!

19:12.652 --> 19:15.073
FINE! HATE ME NOW. YOU'RE
GONNA THANK ME FOR IT LATER.

19:15.074 --> 19:16.825
OH, YEAH RIGHT. AND WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

19:16.826 --> 19:18.947
FORBID ME FROM SEEING
EMERSON AGAIN?

19:18.948 --> 19:20.409
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.541
YEAH. NO MORE OF
THAT SKEEZY GUY.

19:22.542 --> 19:25.043
NOW YOU TAKE THIS BAG AND YOU
GET UPSTAIRS TO YOUR ROOM

19:25.044 --> 19:26.375
RIGHT NOW, YOUNG LADY!

19:26.376 --> 19:28.337
FINE! IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL
BE UPSTAIRS IN MY ROOM

19:28.338 --> 19:29.878
CURSING YOUR NAME.

19:29.879 --> 19:30.880
LOVE IT!

19:34.344 --> 19:35.884
WHAT WAS THAT?

19:35.885 --> 19:38.887
DID YOU GO OVER THERE AND
DRAG HER BACK LIKE A CAVEMAN?

19:38.888 --> 19:40.799
I DID. COOL, HUH?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.641
AREN'T YOU HAPPY?

19:42.642 --> 19:44.643
ARE YOU KIDDING? I'M THRILLED.

19:44.644 --> 19:46.225
BUT I'M ALSO CONFUSED.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.307
I THOUGHT YOU SAID WE HAD
TO ACCEPT HER DECISIONS.

19:48.308 --> 19:51.069
YEAH, I REALIZED THAT
WAS A BUNCH OF CRAP.

19:51.070 --> 19:53.071
AND WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?

19:53.072 --> 19:54.523
YOU'RE OVER-THINKING IT.

19:54.524 --> 19:56.985
PARENTING IS ABOUT STEPPING
UP AND DOING THE TOUGH STUFF.

19:56.986 --> 19:59.988
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID. I STEPPED
UP AND I DID THE TOUGH STUFF.

19:59.989 --> 20:01.240
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.661
AND I'M SURE THE TOUGHEST PART

20:02.662 --> 20:05.163
WAS DRAGGING HER BACK
HER AGAINST HER WILL

20:05.164 --> 20:08.748
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DRIVING
HER CAR AND YOUR CAR.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.883
I SAID IT WASN'T EASY.

20:14.884 --> 20:17.886
HONEY, HONEY, THINK OF IT LIKE
AN INCREDIBLE MAGIC TRICK.

20:17.887 --> 20:19.428
OKAY? YOU DON'T
KNOW HOW IT'S DONE,

20:19.429 --> 20:20.759
BUT YOU JUST MARVEL AT
THE SKILL OF THE GUY

20:20.760 --> 20:22.931
WHO MADE THE TIGER DISAPPEAR.

20:22.932 --> 20:24.223
YOU'RE REALLY NOT GONNA TELL ME?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.225
NO.

20:30.690 --> 20:31.850
- HEY.
- HEY.

20:31.851 --> 20:32.851
HEY. WELCOME BACK.

20:32.852 --> 20:34.903
- HOW WAS MONTREAL?
- AWESOME.

20:34.904 --> 20:36.735
YEAH? DID YOU HAVE A GOOD
TIME USING YOUR FRENCH?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.697
YEAH, I GOT TO GO TO A
RESTAURANT AND SAY,

20:38.698 --> 20:39.949
"S'IL VOUS PLAIT LE BIG MAC."

20:41.741 --> 20:43.862
MUST BE REELING FROM
THE CULTURE SHOCK.

20:43.863 --> 20:45.284
RYDER, NOW THAT YOU'RE
HOME, WILL YOU PLEASE

20:45.285 --> 20:46.865
PUT YOUR PASSPORT SOMEWHERE
YOU CAN REMEMBER?

20:46.866 --> 20:48.708
YEAH. I'LL DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

20:51.831 --> 20:52.871
OH, CRAP.

20:52.872 --> 20:54.172
I THINK I LEFT IT ON THE BUS.

20:54.173 --> 20:55.874
I DID IT AGAIN.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.716
HEY! SLOW DOWN. STOP!

20:57.717 --> 20:58.718
BONJOUR!

21:00.009 --> 21:01.260
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

21:02.882 --> 21:04.933
OH, THAT BUS IS
NOT SLOWING DOWN.

21:04.934 --> 21:06.936
NEITHER IS HE.

21:08.598 --> 21:11.059
OH MY...

21:11.060 --> 21:12.691
IT'S HIS PASSPORT.
HE DROPPED IT.

21:12.692 --> 21:14.693
- I GOTTA GO AFTER HIM.
- WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

21:14.694 --> 21:16.855
HE MADE US SEARCH FOR THAT
THING FOR A FEW DAYS.

21:16.856 --> 21:19.858
I THINK WE SHOULD LET
HIM RUN A FEW MILES.

21:19.859 --> 21:21.701
BUT, MEL... THAT SEEMS FAIR.

21:23.863 --> 21:25.665
AU REVOIR.
