WEBVTT

00:01.948 --> 00:02.797
Hey, honey.

00:03.504 --> 00:05.170
I found a box of your stuff in your closet.

00:05.055 --> 00:07.508
You must have forgotten it in your big boy move.

00:09.142 --> 00:09.991
What do you got there?

00:10.087 --> 00:11.470
I think... Oh.

00:12.054 --> 00:14.139
Wow, look at all the trophies.

00:14.279 --> 00:15.938
I had no idea you were so into sports.

00:16.343 --> 00:17.643
Michael into sports?

00:17.878 --> 00:20.459
-Those are all "Academic Decathlon" trophies.
-Yeah.

00:21.581 --> 00:24.233
They're actually just bowling trophies with the bowling balls cut off.

00:24.381 --> 00:27.810
Oh, I was wondering why all the smart people stood like this.

00:29.909 --> 00:32.575
Oh, check this out. It's a picture of my old decathlon team.

00:33.037 --> 00:34.914
- Wow, that's your team, huh?
- Yeah.

00:35.185 --> 00:37.538
- That girl's actually kind of cute.
-  That's me.

00:41.159 --> 00:42.501
I wonder what's on these.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.704
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're just gonna pop a tape in in front of your mom?

00:45.762 --> 00:49.383
Aren't you worried that that might be something... "adult-themed"?

00:49.635 --> 00:52.427
Like, pornography? I'm not into that garbage.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.638
I think the fact that it's so acceptable

00:54.847 --> 00:56.265
is a real embarrassment.

00:57.888 --> 00:59.726
I love this guy.

01:05.670 --> 01:08.193
I guess some of your tapes got mixed in with mine.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.202
Mom!

01:17.573 --> 01:19.746
Yeah, not much slowed her down.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.569
What?! Back then no one knew that was bad for your baby!

01:23.666 --> 01:26.170
That was 20 years ago, Mom. They totally knew!

01:27.098 --> 01:28.661
It's okay, Michael. It's okay, Michael.

01:28.719 --> 01:32.009
My mom partied when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out pretty, uh...

01:32.433 --> 01:33.635
I, uh...

01:35.455 --> 01:37.264
That's the pigeon that took my sandwich!

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074

02:19.661 --> 02:22.434
Al, right, the disposal should work now. Flip the switch on.

02:24.667 --> 02:25.854
All right, turn it off.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.107
All right, turn it on.

02:30.126 --> 02:31.026
Turn it off.

02:32.129 --> 02:33.529
Okay, turn it on.

02:35.669 --> 02:37.115
All right, turn it off.

02:40.272 --> 02:41.578
Turn it on.

02:43.911 --> 02:44.957
Turn it off.

02:47.898 --> 02:49.545
Thank you very much for your help.

02:49.710 --> 02:50.963
Oh, Yeah. No problem.

02:54.115 --> 02:55.467
Hey, where have you guys been?

02:55.717 --> 02:57.167
I took Michael underwear shopping.

02:57.727 --> 02:59.137
Are you still wearing those things?

03:02.132 --> 03:03.116
What's the deal with this?

03:03.212 --> 03:05.644
Oh, Alex is fixing the garbage disposal.

03:05.820 --> 03:08.814
My God, that is so strange. From the neck down, I thought you were a boy.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.568
Oh, from the neck down, I thought you were a Hooters waitress.

03:14.535 --> 03:15.171
Nice.

03:15.307 --> 03:17.155
Thanks. I thought of it the other day.

03:19.311 --> 03:23.120
You are never going to believe who called me up today. Donna DiGregorio.

03:23.353 --> 03:25.050
She's coming to L.A. It's a last-minute thing.

03:25.147 --> 03:27.416
Donna?! Donna's coming here?

03:28.161 --> 03:30.977
- Why are you talking that way?
- What? What way is that?

03:31.151 --> 03:34.381
You remember my friend Donna from high school.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.216
He used to have a thing for her.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.073
He'd get all nervous and weird when she was around.

03:38.131 --> 03:38.633
You?

03:38.671 --> 03:39.906
It's true, yeah.

03:40.041 --> 03:42.395
My experience with Donna is the reason I do not

03:42.447 --> 03:44.683
make fun of yow when you get all weird around girls.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.274
- You make fun of me every time.
- Come on! You are ridiculous!

03:50.170 --> 03:52.408
We used to have some fun. She taught me a lot.

03:52.505 --> 03:54.818
Hnw to dress, how to drink, how to pick up guys.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.112
Yeah, she's basically the reason you're here.

03:59.311 --> 04:01.182
I can't remember her. What's she like?

04:01.491 --> 04:04.481
She's everything you could ever want in a girl.

04:04.558 --> 04:05.746
Pretty? Yes.

04:05.812 --> 04:06.488
Funny? Yes.

04:06.565 --> 04:07.789
Smart? No.

04:08.970 --> 04:10.012
This could be fun, you know?

04:10.070 --> 04:12.127
I was always too afraid to go after her when I was young,

04:12.160 --> 04:13.879
but now that I've come into my own...

04:13.962 --> 04:16.255
- She's married.
- Stupid monogamy!

04:26.881 --> 04:28.290
Guess who?

04:28.386 --> 04:29.312
Uh...

04:29.848 --> 04:33.982
smells like hair spray, Juicy Fruit gum and tequila... Donna DiGregorio?!

04:36.136 --> 04:37.120
Hey, Donna!

04:37.178 --> 04:39.696
Look at you, little Joey Tribbiani.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.659
You look good. Not that I didn't think you would look good.

04:43.745 --> 04:46.453
I mean, not that I thought about how you would look at all. I mean...

04:46.607 --> 04:48.872
Hold it together. You're semi-famous now.

04:50.066 --> 04:52.709
Can you believe how she looks now? She's a spokesmodel.

04:52.863 --> 04:56.713
"This mattress clings to the contours of my body."

04:57.145 --> 05:00.467
See? All that mattress experience paid off, huh?

05:01.483 --> 05:03.262
I cannot believe you are here!

05:02.931 --> 05:04.937
Come here! Oh, my God!

05:05.053 --> 05:07.330
- And you look so good.
- I know! So do you!

05:07.368 --> 05:08.517
I know!

05:09.570 --> 05:10.882
You should have been at the last reunion.

05:10.959 --> 05:12.563
Everyone looks like crap.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.315
They've either gotten fat or had weird plastic surgery.

05:16.559 --> 05:17.484
Dumb-asses.

05:19.975 --> 05:22.464
Oh, Alex, hey, this is Donna. Donna, Alex.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.911
Donna is a friend of ours from high school.

05:23.988 --> 05:25.742
Oh, pleased to meet you.

05:25.804 --> 05:27.329
Is this the one you were talking about?

05:27.425 --> 05:30.914
- Yeah.
- I see what you mean!

05:31.317 --> 05:33.584
Oh, great, there's two of them now.

05:35.367 --> 05:37.504
Hey, Joey, can I use your phone?

05:37.562 --> 05:38.714
Sure,  yeah.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.687
You want to check in with your husband?

05:40.744 --> 05:45.179
Oh, no. I just gave Gina the whole story. I'm getting divnrced.

05:49.669 --> 05:51.185
- No!
- Yes!

05:51.560 --> 05:52.686
- No!
- Why?

05:52.868 --> 05:54.700
They  just broke up. She's very fragile.

05:54.758 --> 05:56.481
I know it's gonna be so easy!

05:58.166 --> 06:01.278
I'm serious. She's in the middle of a divorce. She doesn't need you complicate things.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.905
No, Joey.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.949
Donna was one of the few people who stuck by me when I got pregnant.

06:06.048 --> 06:08.248
Now  that she's going through a rough time, I would like to help her out.

06:08.286 --> 06:09.618
Her life's messy enough without you.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.971
What, you think I'm just going to sleep with her and then lose interest?

06:12.048 --> 06:14.416
No I think you're going to marry her like all the others.

06:15.610 --> 06:18.462
-Come on! 
-Joey, this is important to me.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.673
There are plenty of other women out there. Just stay away from this one.

06:22.306 --> 06:23.759
Okay, fine.

06:23.878 --> 06:25.595
- Promise?
- I promise.

06:25.633 --> 06:27.387
- You swear on Grandma's life?
- Yes.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.639
- The living one.
- Damn it!

06:30.123 --> 06:31.350
Okay.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.520
I forgot to tell work I was leaving town.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.524
I'm supposed to be in a bikini jumping up ant down on a trampoline right now.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.944
- What are you selling?
- Blenders.

06:43.963 --> 06:45.275
I've got to go get Michael.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.029
You want to come and then we can do some sightseeing?

06:47.164 --> 06:50.494
I think I'd kinda like to hang around here for a while if that's okay.

06:50.735 --> 06:51.703
Okay.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.833
You get some sun. And you don't get anything.

07:00.746 --> 07:02.923
You know, I've been following your career.

07:03.158 --> 07:05.592
I guess some people are surprised you're a big success.

07:06.023 --> 07:07.511
Me? I'm shocked.

07:09.034 --> 07:10.138
Me, too.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.810
You just always seemed so shaky and nervous around people.

07:15.352 --> 07:20.065
Uh, yeah, I think that might have been more of a Donna-specific behavior.

07:20.341 --> 07:21.316
Why?

07:23.338 --> 07:24.361
- Well...
- Oh...

07:24.515 --> 07:26.864
Is that why you used to break dance for me?

07:35.663 --> 07:38.375
Shocking that didn't work, huh? Yeah...

07:39.357 --> 07:43.949
So little Joey Tribbiani liked me. I can't believe I didn't pick up on that.

07:44.103 --> 07:45.126
Oh, I can believe it.

07:45.194 --> 07:47.316
You had a lot of guys fighting for your attention.

07:47.412 --> 07:49.887
You were... something else.

07:53.405 --> 07:55.682
Hey! Miss mattress, you're coming with me.

07:59.131 --> 08:00.810
This is fun sorting through these tapes.

08:00.879 --> 08:02.105
Only one more tape to go.

08:02.327 --> 08:05.194
If this is another spelling bee, I'm going to put a fork in my eye.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.326
This is weird. Why is there a tape of kids playing baseball?

08:12.444 --> 08:13.869
Maybe you're out there.

08:14.147 --> 08:16.079
I doubt it. I was awful at sports.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.500
But I also don't like the idea of my mom just videotaping other children.

08:23.975 --> 08:25.297
That's me.

08:26.171 --> 08:27.503
This is weird, you know...

08:27.580 --> 08:29.551
I do kind of remember playing Little League for a while.

08:30.282 --> 08:33.722
God, this is gonna be embarrassing. I don't wanna see this.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.149
No, no, no, no! If you let me watch this,

08:35.226 --> 08:38.477
afterwards I'll show you a tape of me doing stand-up.

08:38.658 --> 08:41.230
This guy heckles me, and I totally lose it!

08:42.225 --> 08:43.190
Deal.

08:43.851 --> 08:46.401
Okay, guys, back it up! We've got Michael at the plate!

08:46.707 --> 08:48.612
What, even the coach is making fun of me?

08:53.289 --> 08:55.202
Another home run for Michael!

08:55.575 --> 08:56.501
Wait a minute.

08:57.369 --> 08:58.914
Was I good at baseball?

08:59.028 --> 09:00.457
It sure looks like it.

09:00.811 --> 09:03.917
Why didn't I know that? Why did my mother keep this from me?

09:04.071 --> 09:06.213
Why is that little boy peeing on third base?

09:08.279 --> 09:09.508
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.135
- Mom, was I good at baseball?
- What are you talking about?

09:13.193 --> 09:17.057
Why did you keep this from him? And what did that kid drink?

09:19.236 --> 09:22.604
Okay. You were a good ballplayer, but I pulled you out of it.

09:22.705 --> 09:23.438
Why?

09:23.573 --> 09:25.039
'Cause I didn't want you to get hurt.

09:25.116 --> 09:26.817
I was just trying to protect you.

09:26.871 --> 09:28.485
Joey, tell him I was right.

09:28.902 --> 09:29.987
I don't know, Gina.

09:30.058 --> 09:31.659
I mean, I got hurt all the time when I was a kid.

09:31.755 --> 09:35.367
And, yeah, I've got some scars, but each one taught me an important lesson:

09:35.701 --> 09:37.286
Don't touch the stove.

09:37.819 --> 09:39.913
Don't run with scissors in your mouth.

09:40.995 --> 09:43.250
Don't lick the peanut butter off steak knife.

09:46.161 --> 09:48.090
You know, I don't have any scars.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.382
Or body hair. You think that's related to this?

09:51.927 --> 09:53.470
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

09:53.528 --> 09:55.304
I'm sorry you don't have any scars.

09:55.657 --> 09:56.950
I guess I was a terrible mother.

09:57.047 --> 10:00.017
No, I'm just saying I missed out on something important.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.525
Well, thank God you moved out.

10:01.564 --> 10:04.521
Now you can play baseball and crack your head open all you want.

10:06.368 --> 10:09.902
Cracking your head open... always stay seated in the roller-coaster.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.623
Hi, you must be Michael.  I'm your mom's friend, Donna.

10:22.719 --> 10:23.707
Oh.

10:23.896 --> 10:24.750
Hi.

10:25.034 --> 10:28.045
I didn't know you looked... looked...

10:29.046 --> 10:30.921
I mean, I had no idea... that, that, that...

10:30.979 --> 10:32.382
Right there with ya, buddy.

10:33.485 --> 10:34.885
N-nice to meet you.

10:37.580 --> 10:39.181
Hey, what are you doing here?

10:39.789 --> 10:42.768
I don't know. I guess I just wanted to come spend  some time with you.

10:43.617 --> 10:45.896
- Why?
- Why?!

10:46.651 --> 10:48.524
Do you need me to break-dance for you?

10:49.942 --> 10:50.901
Oh.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.826
See, I was out with Gina and I loved being with her,

10:55.980 --> 10:59.701
but we were sitting there talking and for some reason,

10:59.952 --> 11:02.496
I couldn't stop thinking about her  little brother

11:02.955 --> 11:05.123
and how nice he'd grown up.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.962
You're touching me. Don't touch me. You can't touch me!

11:10.049 --> 11:11.421
You can't! You can't! You can't!

11:13.674 --> 11:15.717
Wow, that's the first time that's ever happened.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.418
No, no, no, Donna.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.187
I would love to spend more time with you,

11:19.303 --> 11:21.598
but I promised Gina I wouldn't do anything with you.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.933
Why?

11:23.265 --> 11:24.852
She thinks you're in a weird place.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.646
I'm not in a weird place. I'm in your apartment.

11:29.941 --> 11:32.609
Oh, God, you are the perfect amount of dumb!

11:35.789 --> 11:39.116
No, she thinks you're in a weird place in your life with the divorce.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.909
She's afraid you're a little fragile.

11:40.994 --> 11:43.245
Well, it's too bad.

11:43.745 --> 11:44.955
It could have been fun.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.082
We're both very sexy.

11:52.002 --> 11:52.909
It's funny.

11:53.392 --> 11:56.091
You like me and I don't even notice you.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.052
And I want you, and you can't do anything about it.

11:59.737 --> 12:03.390
I guess it's not meant to be. I'll see ya.

12:14.772 --> 12:17.589
Oh, my God, I have wanted to do that for so long.

12:17.666 --> 12:18.697
Me,  too!

12:18.910 --> 12:19.431
Really?

12:19.470 --> 12:22.075
Actually, it's only been since this morning, but it's been tough.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.128
God, I can't believe I fell asleep.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.256
You should have woken me up. I've gotta get back to Gina's.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.259
No, last night can't end with you running out the door.

12:39.302 --> 12:40.318
Let me make you a proper breakfast.

12:40.376 --> 12:41.956
Joey, I don't have time for that.

12:42.014 --> 12:44.932
- Come on, how many eggs do you want?
- Six.

12:46.739 --> 12:47.768
She's perfect.

12:50.745 --> 12:53.023
So, last night was really fun.

12:53.352 --> 12:56.818
It was, yeah. And not just the part that's supposed to be fun--

12:58.025 --> 13:00.113
the talking, the sharing.

13:00.495 --> 13:03.951
And I finally get what this cuddling fuss is all about.

13:05.465 --> 13:07.830
I still can't believe this has happened. You...

13:09.395 --> 13:11.625
you are, like, my dream girl.

13:15.955 --> 13:18.810
- Michael? Joey? Open up.
- Oh, my God. Gina.

13:19.601 --> 13:20.759
Okay, new plan:

13:20.836 --> 13:24.179
last night ends with you sneaking out the back and rolling down the hill.

13:25.050 --> 13:27.724
- We'll talk later.
- Yeah, you got to get out of here.

13:27.785 --> 13:33.110
- What is taking so long?
- Uh... I'm, uh... naked.

13:33.231 --> 13:34.832
I'm just covering myself up.

13:36.705 --> 13:37.901
Sorry.

13:38.788 --> 13:39.965
I don't get people like you.

13:40.023 --> 13:42.239
Why do you gotta walk around naked in your house?

13:42.297 --> 13:44.366
Why do you gotta walk around naked in public?

13:45.885 --> 13:47.786
Because I like to make the world smile.

13:49.715 --> 13:51.957
I'm really worried. Donna didn't come home last night.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.251
I'm sure she's fine.

13:54.879 --> 13:56.378
What makes you say that?

13:57.722 --> 13:59.590
What makes people say anything, really? I mean...

14:00.935 --> 14:04.386
- Was she here?
- Gina, I made a promise.

14:06.772 --> 14:09.299
Only six eggs. This omelet isn't for you. What's going on?

14:09.318 --> 14:10.437
It's for Michael.

14:10.495 --> 14:13.645
- He only takes two eggs.
- That skinny little bastard.

14:15.186 --> 14:19.064
All right, look... I know I broke a promise, but I have a good excuse.

14:19.141 --> 14:22.571
- Oh, yeah? What?
- She is so hot.

14:23.064 --> 14:26.151
- God, you are so unbelievable.
- Gina, come on, she's a big girl.

14:26.209 --> 14:27.868
She can make her own decisions.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.191
She can't right now. That's why I didn't want you to mess with her.

14:30.288 --> 14:32.660
I'm not messing with her. I really care about her.

14:32.815 --> 14:35.334
Oh, like you cared about ten of my friends in one month's time?

14:35.584 --> 14:37.628
Ah, yes, October of '89.

14:40.534 --> 14:42.799
- I can't believe you did this.
- Wait, wait a minute.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.219
Look, this is different from all those other girls, okay?

14:45.344 --> 14:48.722
I mean, maybe it's because there's a history with Donna,

14:48.847 --> 14:52.350
but yesterday, when I was with her, it was the first time since I've been in L.A.

14:52.466 --> 14:55.979
that I actually... that I actually felt like I was home.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.440
Oh, damn it, that's nice.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.236
Look, Gina, I don't want to upset you, okay?

15:02.736 --> 15:06.114
But I'm really into Donna. And I want to see her again tonight.

15:09.456 --> 15:11.620
- You treat her right.
- I promise.

15:11.873 --> 15:14.623
And not the kind of promise I made before. A real one.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.962
So, you and Donna DiGregorio, huh?

15:20.519 --> 15:23.924
I guess the only friend of mine you haven't been with is Jenny Wagner.

15:27.809 --> 15:30.722
- October of '89?
- It was a good month.

15:36.488 --> 15:37.877
Think I'll still be good at this?

15:37.947 --> 15:40.339
It's like having sex on a bicycle. It'll just come back to you.

15:45.451 --> 15:48.115
- How's my swing look?
- Like you're good at science.

15:49.825 --> 15:51.831
Okay, try it again. Nice and hard this time.

15:51.927 --> 15:52.834
All right.

15:53.780 --> 15:58.500
Okay, I'm only saying this to be supportive and helpful: Are you kidding?

16:00.189 --> 16:02.713
Just put some quarters in the machine, will you, please?

16:06.313 --> 16:08.493
Oh, shoot, I'm short one. Give me another quarter.

16:08.570 --> 16:10.179
Go in the glove compartment.

16:11.564 --> 16:14.349
What the hell?! I thought you said you needed another quarter.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.685
- For a gum ball.
- For a g... aah!

16:21.202 --> 16:22.441
Oh, man.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.194
This is one good gum ball.

16:26.309 --> 16:28.030
Still  flavorful, you know.

16:28.110 --> 16:31.366
I mean, when it came out yellow, I was all, like, "What?"

16:33.734 --> 16:35.370
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:35.829 --> 16:36.830
What happened to you?

16:36.904 --> 16:38.916
I was attacked by a gang of baseballs.

16:40.182 --> 16:41.263
Oh, so you played?

16:41.398 --> 16:43.713
Well, I tried. Any talent I had before is now gone.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.255
Long gone.

16:45.339 --> 16:47.749
Look, honey, I'm sorry.

16:47.904 --> 16:50.636
But you were good at a lot of things. I had to make a choice.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.753
You could either be the jock or the smart kid.

16:52.791 --> 16:56.058
And I figured being the smart kid would lead you more places.

16:56.131 --> 16:56.787
She's right.

16:56.903 --> 16:58.890
We actually went to school with a lot of jocks, you know.

16:58.928 --> 17:00.479
And those guys are nowhere now.

17:00.716 --> 17:02.231
Except for the three guys in the NBA.

17:03.338 --> 17:05.067
I just don't see why you had to choose.

17:06.029 --> 17:07.236
Maybe you're right.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.321
But you got to understand, when I made that decision, I was just a kid.

17:10.645 --> 17:14.076
I mean, when you were five, I was 20. That's how old you are now.

17:16.891 --> 17:20.165
Well, I mean, if I look at it that way, then I can forgive you for anything.

17:20.671 --> 17:24.545
Good, 'cause I also might have bathed with you longer than was appropriate.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.675
See? You got scars.

17:29.867 --> 17:31.510
On the inside.

17:44.356 --> 17:47.276
it took me three months to grow that, but help yourself.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.738
Oh, sorry. I got a big date tonight.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.470
Really? Who with?

17:53.508 --> 17:55.576
- You remember Donna?
- Yeah.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.162
Did I see her rolling down the hill this morning?

17:59.804 --> 18:02.416
Oh, look at you. You look so happy.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.835
- Are you in love?
- No.

18:04.908 --> 18:06.461
- Are you on the way to being in love?
- No.

18:06.603 --> 18:08.672
Are you on the way to "on the way to being in love"?

18:08.742 --> 18:10.174
I think I might be.

18:12.112 --> 18:16.279
Well, you have to understand I had the biggest crushon this girl, you know,

18:16.318 --> 18:17.931
so I really built her up.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.309
And you'd think getting to be with her would be disappointing,

18:20.601 --> 18:24.146
but I got to say, the real girl is even better than the fantasy.

18:24.224 --> 18:26.540
But, so, how is this gonna work? Doesn't she live in New York?

18:26.655 --> 18:29.781
Yeah, yeah, she said she was toying with the idea of moving out here,

18:29.858 --> 18:31.737
but I don't think it's gonna happen.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.906
Well, you should tell her you want her to stay.

18:34.220 --> 18:34.992
Yeah, you think?

18:35.107 --> 18:37.117
Yeah, when I first met my husband,

18:37.409 --> 18:39.324
we had this great couple of weeks together.

18:39.363 --> 18:41.497
And then I was supposed to leave for a job in Chicago

18:41.705 --> 18:44.875
and he said, "Please don't go. I don't ever want to be apart."

18:45.584 --> 18:46.919
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Yeah.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.347
Then he took out his viola and he played Billy Joel's "She's Always a Woman,"

18:50.501 --> 18:52.424
and I had to smile through it like this.

18:55.556 --> 18:58.764
So you think if I ask her, she might stay?

18:59.867 --> 19:02.601
Well, she'd be crazy if she didn't want to.

19:02.674 --> 19:06.271
Because you are one of the last remaining good ones.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.398
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

19:08.521 --> 19:09.191
There.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.568
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot, Alex.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.506
Say, Alex, you know, if Donna does move out,

19:15.564 --> 19:18.659
maybe you and Gina and her could hang out and be friends.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.118
- Maybe.
- Don't Billy Joel smile me.

19:26.959 --> 19:27.960
Here's what I was thinking for tonight.

19:28.044 --> 19:29.354
Thought maybe we could

19:29.412 --> 19:32.673
have dinner at this great little place in Marina Del Rey.

19:32.723 --> 19:33.799
Then after that,

19:33.903 --> 19:36.844
we're going to go to a dessert-only place I heard about in Newport.

19:36.949 --> 19:37.972
And then after that,

19:38.055 --> 19:41.348
I thought maybe we could go for a walk on the beach in Malibu.

19:41.429 --> 19:43.100
That's like five hours of driving.

19:45.195 --> 19:46.103
Really?

19:46.175 --> 19:48.730
Why can't they make maps the size things really are?

19:50.721 --> 19:51.692
All right, uh...

19:52.150 --> 19:54.069
Well, I'm going to go change some of our reservations...

19:56.628 --> 19:58.943
I can't believe you are going out with my brother.

19:59.009 --> 20:00.147
I don't want to get ahead of myself,

20:00.205 --> 20:01.324
but if you guys get married,

20:01.382 --> 20:04.141
you should do it at the Polish Community Center on Queens Boulevard.

20:04.314 --> 20:06.039
It's very classy.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.710
I gotta talk to you about something.

20:09.949 --> 20:12.013
- What? You all right?
- No.

20:12.557 --> 20:15.424
Gina, I feel really weird talking to you about this,

20:15.716 --> 20:17.885
but  I'm confused, and I don't know what to do.

20:17.963 --> 20:19.011
What's the matter?

20:20.549 --> 20:23.432
Ron just called. He wants to get back together.

20:23.699 --> 20:24.766
And what'd you say?

20:24.816 --> 20:27.728
I said I met someone else and I had to think about it.

20:28.447 --> 20:29.897
You're gonna tell Joey, right?

20:30.287 --> 20:31.690
You have to tell him.

20:33.407 --> 20:36.570
Okay, I couldn't change the reservations. So we gotta haul ass.

20:38.544 --> 20:40.324
Are you ready, beautiful?

20:47.424 --> 20:49.701
Aw, Joey...

20:51.325 --> 20:53.712
Those two would have some stupid kids.

20:54.035 --> 20:57.112
