"Are you stronger, more powerful?"

15:04.654 --> 15:08.613
No, I knew there was no way you suddenly
got that good at lacrosse.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.113
"Which means you're actually
a cheater, aren't you?"

15:12.329 --> 15:14.160
I mean, can you even play lacrosse?

15:14.331 --> 15:15.081
Yes.

a bunch of shots tonight, aren't you?"

you're not a lying cheat,"

my hands all over that tight little body.

this kind of power over you. Okay?

you never got the chance to do,"

He actually asked me if you were coming.

you didn't feel weird about it."

- So it wasn't Scott.

you could borrow one of my shirts.

Tell him I'll be there,
I'll just be a little bit late, okay?

31:17.251 --> 31:18.752
All right, thanks.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.619
- You're not gonna make it.
- I know.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.340
And you didn't tell him
about his mom, either.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.919
(SIGHS) Not till we find out the truth.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.593
- By the way, one more thing.
- Yeah.

31:29.805 --> 31:34.799
- Oh, God! What the hell was...
- You know what that was for. Go.

31:35.019 --> 31:36.555
Go!

31:48.157 --> 31:50.899
(SIGHS) It's the bite that does it, isn't it?

31:55.373 --> 31:56.362
Yes.

31:58.209 --> 32:01.667
- Well, then, it's easy.
- No, it's not.

32:01.879 --> 32:05.167
I can't be the one to do it, okay?
It has to be...

32:05.383 --> 32:07.715
It has to be an Alpha.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.508
Well, then, you get him to do it.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.462
I don't even know who he is.
Okay, trust me,

32:12.681 --> 32:14.672
this whole thing is
so much more complicated than you think.

32:14.892 --> 32:17.349
(STAMMERING) There's... There's others.

32:18.896 --> 32:19.976
There's hunters.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.977
Hunting what? What hunters?

32:25.569 --> 32:26.775
Werewolf hunters.

32:26.987 --> 32:27.851
(SNICKERS)

32:28.072 --> 32:32.031
- Oh, my God. You've got to be kidding me.
- No, jerkoff!

32:32.243 --> 32:34.029
There's a whole family of them,
and they carry assault rifles.

32:34.245 --> 32:36.611
Do you get that? Assault rifles.

32:41.419 --> 32:42.829
Them?

32:43.045 --> 32:44.546
What? No, no...

32:44.755 --> 32:49.124
Oh, my God, that actually makes sense.
Allison Argent.

32:50.928 --> 32:53.419
You've known her this long,
and you never actually asked her for...

32:53.639 --> 32:56.096
Her name, idiot.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.433
Do you know
what Argent means in French?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.889
It means silver.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.736
Yeah, I said I can't find her.

33:10.948 --> 33:13.064
Look, ask for Jennifer.
She's been looking after my uncle.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.451
Yeah, well, he's not here either.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.910
- What?
- "He's not here. He's gone, Derek."

33:24.795 --> 33:26.001
Stiles, get out of there right now.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.499
"It's him! He's the Alpha! Get out!"

33:34.138 --> 33:36.049
You must be Stiles.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.471
What are you doing here?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.556
Visiting hours are over.

33:47.776 --> 33:48.982
You...

33:49.195 --> 33:50.901
And him.

33:52.114 --> 33:54.571
You're the one who...

33:54.992 --> 33:57.449
Oh, my... And he's...

33:57.995 --> 34:00.156
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.908
I'm gonna die.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.494
That's not nice.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.658
She's my nurse.

34:06.879 --> 34:10.087
She's a psychotic bitch
helping you kill people. Get out of the way.

34:10.299 --> 34:11.914
Oh, damn.

34:12.468 --> 34:14.709
You think I killed Laura on purpose?

34:14.929 --> 34:16.089
One of my own family?

34:16.305 --> 34:17.715
(GROWLS)

34:32.613 --> 34:34.695
(GRUNTS)

34:34.907 --> 34:36.317
My mind,

34:36.534 --> 34:38.991
my personality were literally

34:39.620 --> 34:41.531
burned out of me.

34:42.456 --> 34:44.538
I was being driven by pure instinct.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.128
You want forgiveness?

34:52.633 --> 34:55.090
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:55.427 --> 34:57.042
I want understanding.

34:59.807 --> 35:05.427
Do you have any idea
what it was like for me during those years?

35:07.064 --> 35:10.431
Slowly healing, cell by cell.

35:10.651 --> 35:13.984
Even more slowly coming
back to consciousness.

35:14.196 --> 35:16.938
Yes, becoming an Alpha,

35:17.157 --> 35:22.368
taking that from Laura pushed me
over a plateau in the healing process.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.116
I can't help that.

35:28.419 --> 35:29.704
(BONES CRUNCHING)

35:29.920 --> 35:30.875
(GROANING)

35:31.088 --> 35:33.579
I tried to tell you what was happening.

35:33.757 --> 35:34.917
I tried to warn you.

35:57.573 --> 36:01.816
It was six years ago, and in my defense,
it was before I'd gotten sober.

36:02.036 --> 36:04.698
Listen, I have my son's
first lacrosse game to get to.

36:04.913 --> 36:08.201
What do you say
we just focus on the details, huh?

36:09.251 --> 36:13.290
I met her at a bar. We had a lot of drinks.

36:14.298 --> 36:15.538
A lot.

36:16.925 --> 36:21.294
She started asking me what I do,
and she kept asking questions.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.096
Do you have any idea what that's like?

36:24.308 --> 36:28.392
To have someone actually
interested in the topic of chemistry...

36:28.604 --> 36:30.140
After staring at all these
vacant faces day after...

36:30.356 --> 36:32.187
Details.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.725
Like I said, I talked.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.895
It was fascinating stuff.

36:41.075 --> 36:45.068
How you could melt away
the lock of a bank vault.

36:45.287 --> 36:48.450
How you could dissolve a body,
and get away with murder.

36:48.666 --> 36:51.624
How you could start a fire
and get away with arson?

36:52.920 --> 36:55.878
And a week later,
the Hale house burns down.

36:56.965 --> 37:00.298
- You know, you could have said something.
- And be an accomplice?

37:00.719 --> 37:03.131
It would have ended my teaching career.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.223
So you don't know her name
or where she was from?

37:12.606 --> 37:16.770
No!
Which is exactly what Laura Hale asked.

37:17.194 --> 37:20.152
I'll point you
in the same direction that I pointed her.

37:26.829 --> 37:30.117
- What is this?
- The necklace the girl was wearing.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.407
That's the symbol on it.
I asked her about it.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.537
She said it was a family thing.

37:35.462 --> 37:40.126
You find the girl wearing that necklace,
she's your arsonist.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.799
- Murderer.
- Excuse me?

37:43.721 --> 37:47.213
Arson happens to property.
This girl's a murderer.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.889
(COUGHING)

37:53.105 --> 37:55.562
(GRUNTING)

38:07.953 --> 38:11.662
I was going to wait
for dramatic flair, but...

38:27.473 --> 38:30.681
When you look this good, why wait?

38:35.105 --> 38:38.142
Derek, you have to give me
a chance to explain.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.026
After all, we're family.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.441
Now, this is what I like to see,

38:48.744 --> 38:51.201
rivals turned allies.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.742
You know there's no "me" in "team,"
right, boys?

38:55.292 --> 38:57.203
Yes, there is, Coach.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.585
Okay, smartass, how 'bout this...

39:00.798 --> 39:06.009
No "A" in Econ if no win on field?
Good? Huh?

39:06.386 --> 39:07.922
Perfect. Good.

39:08.430 --> 39:09.806
So what are you gonna do?

39:09.973 --> 39:14.512
(SIGHS) Well, I'm gonna
give you a chance to give me what I want.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.434
What's three days, huh?

39:16.647 --> 39:17.932
Seventy-two hours.

39:18.148 --> 39:20.730
That's all you get, Scott.
Seventy-two hours.

39:20.943 --> 39:22.228
What if I can't?

39:22.486 --> 39:25.944
Oh, come on, McCall.
That's not a winning attitude.

39:26.156 --> 39:27.111
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

39:27.366 --> 39:31.279
FINSTOCK: Let's go! Huddle up!
Let's go! Big night! Big night!

39:45.133 --> 39:46.589
That one. That's Jackson.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.846
Holy hotness.

39:50.013 --> 39:54.632
Oh, if I was in high school again...
Maybe just a substitute teacher.

39:54.852 --> 39:55.967
You are sick.

39:56.186 --> 39:59.223
(CHUCKLES) You should be all over that.

40:04.903 --> 40:09.112
Chris, you remember how
we were talking about a second Beta?

40:09.533 --> 40:10.989
A younger one?

40:11.201 --> 40:12.156
Yes.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.156
Can you get turned by a scratch?

40:16.707 --> 40:20.575
If the claws go deep enough. Maybe.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.589
Wonder how deep those went.

40:25.549 --> 40:26.584
FINSTOCK: Ready?

40:26.800 --> 40:27.664
PLAYERS: Yeah!

40:27.885 --> 40:31.002
FINSTOCK: Say it so they can hear it!
Hands in.

40:31.847 --> 40:33.087
What are we?

40:33.348 --> 40:34.554
ALL: We are lacrosse!

40:34.766 --> 40:36.893
That's right, take the field! Let's go!

40:37.102 --> 40:39.559
(ALL CHEERING)
