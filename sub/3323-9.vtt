"Are you stronger, more powerful?"

15:04.654 --> 15:08.613
No, I knew there was no way you suddenly
got that good at lacrosse.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.113
"Which means you're actually
a cheater, aren't you?"

15:12.329 --> 15:14.160
I mean, can you even play lacrosse?

15:14.331 --> 15:15.081
Yes.

you're not a lying cheat,"

you didn't feel weird about it."

- So it wasn't Scott.

Tell him I'll be there,
I'll just be a little bit late, okay?

31:17.251 --> 31:18.752
All right, thanks.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.619
- You're not gonna make it.
- I know.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.340
And you didn't tell him
about his mom, either.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.919
(SIGHS) Not till we find out the truth.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.593
- By the way, one more thing.
- Yeah.

31:29.805 --> 31:34.799
- Oh, God! What the hell was...
- You know what that was for. Go.

31:35.019 --> 31:36.555
Go!

31:48.157 --> 31:50.899
(SIGHS) It's the bite that does it, isn't it?

31:55.373 --> 31:56.362
Yes.

31:58.209 --> 32:01.667
- Well, then, it's easy.
- No, it's not.

32:01.879 --> 32:05.167
I can't be the one to do it, okay?
It has to be...

32:05.383 --> 32:07.715
It has to be an Alpha.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.508
Well, then, you get him to do it.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.462
I don't even know who he is.
Okay, trust me,

32:12.681 --> 32:14.672
this whole thing is
so much more complicated than you think.

32:14.892 --> 32:17.349
(STAMMERING) There's... There's others.

32:18.896 --> 32:19.976
There's hunters.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.977
Hunting what? What hunters?

32:25.569 --> 32:26.775
Werewolf hunters.

32:26.987 --> 32:27.851
(SNICKERS)

32:28.072 --> 32:32.031
- Oh, my God. You've got to be kidding me.
- No, jerkoff!

32:32.243 --> 32:34.029
There's a whole family of them,
and they carry assault rifles.

32:34.245 --> 32:36.611
Do you get that? Assault rifles.

32:41.419 --> 32:42.829
Them?

32:43.045 --> 32:44.546
What? No, no...

32:44.755 --> 32:49.124
Oh, my God, that actually makes sense.
Allison Argent.

32:50.928 --> 32:53.419
You've known her this long,
and you never actually asked her for...

32:53.639 --> 32:56.096
Her name, idiot.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.433
Do you know
what Argent means in French?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.889
It means silver.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.736
Yeah, I said I can't find her.

33:10.948 --> 33:13.064
Look, ask for Jennifer.
She's been looking after my uncle.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.451
Yeah, well, he's not here either.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.910
- What?
- "He's not here. He's gone, Derek."

33:24.795 --> 33:26.001
Stiles, get out of there right now.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.499
"It's him! He's the Alpha! Get out!"

33:34.138 --> 33:36.049
You must be Stiles.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.471
What are you doing here?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.556
Visiting hours are over.

33:47.776 --> 33:48.982
You...

33:49.195 --> 33:50.901
And him.

33:52.114 --> 33:54.571
You're the one who...

33:54.992 --> 33:57.449
Oh, my... And he's...

33:57.995 --> 34:00.156
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.908
I'm gonna die.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.494
That's not nice.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.658
She's my nurse.

34:06.879 --> 34:10.087
She's a psychotic bitch
helping you kill people. Get out of the way.

34:10.299 --> 34:11.914
Oh, damn.

34:12.468 --> 34:14.709
You think I killed Laura on purpose?

34:14.929 --> 34:16.089
One of my own family?

34:16.305 --> 34:17.715
(GROWLS)

34:32.613 --> 34:34.695
(GRUNTS)

34:34.907 --> 34:36.317
My mind,

34:36.534 --> 34:38.991
my personality were literally

34:39.620 --> 34:41.531
burned out of me.

34:42.456 --> 34:44.538
I was being driven by pure instinct.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.128
You want forgiveness?

34:52.633 --> 34:55.090
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:55.427 --> 34:57.042
I want understanding.

34:59.807 --> 35:05.427
Do you have any idea
what it was like for me during those years?

35:07.064 --> 35:10.431
Slowly healing, cell by cell.

35:10.651 --> 35:13.984
Even more slowly coming
back to consciousness.

35:14.196 --> 35:16.938
Yes, becoming an Alpha,

35:17.157 --> 35:22.368
taking that from Laura pushed me
over a plateau in the healing process.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.116
I can't help that.

35:28.419 --> 35:29.704
(BONES CRUNCHING)

35:29.920 --> 35:30.875
(GROANING)

35:31.088 --> 35:33.579
I tried to tell you what was happening.

35:33.757 --> 35:34.917
I tried to warn you.

35:57.573 --> 36:01.816
It was six years ago, and in my defense,
it was before I'd gotten sober.

36:02.036 --> 36:04.698
Listen, I have my son's
first lacrosse game to get to.

36:04.913 --> 36:08.201
What do you say
we just focus on the details, huh?

36:09.251 --> 36:13.290
I met her at a bar. We had a lot of drinks.

36:14.298 --> 36:15.538
A lot.

36:16.925 --> 36:21.294
She started asking me what I do,
and she kept asking questions.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.096
Do you have any idea what that's like?

36:24.308 --> 36:28.392
To have someone actually
interested in the topic of chemistry...

36:28.604 --> 36:30.140
After staring at all these
vacant faces day after...

36:30.356 --> 36:32.187
Details.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.725
Like I said, I talked.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.895
It was fascinating stuff.

36:41.075 --> 36:45.068
How you could melt away
the lock of a bank vault.

36:45.287 --> 36:48.450
How you could dissolve a body,
and get away with murder.

36:48.666 --> 36:51.624
How you could start a fire
and get away with arson?

36:52.920 --> 36:55.878
And a week later,
the Hale house burns down.

36:56.965 --> 37:00.298
- You know, you could have said something.
- And be an accomplice?

37:00.719 --> 37:03.131
It would have ended my teaching career.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.223
So you don't know her name
or where she was from?

37:12.606 --> 37:16.770
No!
Which is exactly what Laura Hale asked.

37:17.194 --> 37:20.152
I'll point you
in the same direction that I pointed her.

37:26.829 --> 37:30.117
- What is this?
- The necklace the girl was wearing.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.407
That's the symbol on it.
I asked her about it.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.537
She said it was a family thing.

37:35.462 --> 37:40.126
You find the girl wearing that necklace,
she's your arsonist.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.799
- Murderer.
- Excuse me?

37:43.721 --> 37:47.213
Arson happens to property.
This girl's a murderer.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.889
(COUGHING)

37:53.105 --> 37:55.562
(GRUNTING)

38:07.953 --> 38:11.662
I was going to wait
for dramatic flair, but...

38:27.473 --> 38:30.681
When you look this good, why wait?

38:35.105 --> 38:38.142
Derek, you have to give me
a chance to explain.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.026
After all, we're family.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.441
Now, this is what I like to see,

38:48.744 --> 38:51.201
rivals turned allies.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.742
You know there's no "me" in "team,"
right, boys?

38:55.292 --> 38:57.203
Yes, there is, Coach.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.585
Okay, smartass, how 'bout this...

39:00.798 --> 39:06.009
No "A" in Econ if no win on field?
Good? Huh?

39:06.386 --> 39:07.922
Perfect. Good.

39:08.430 --> 39:09.806
So what are you gonna do?

39:09.973 --> 39:14.512
(SIGHS) Well, I'm gonna
give you a chance to give me what I want.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.434
What's three days, huh?

39:16.647 --> 39:17.932
Seventy-two hours.

39:18.148 --> 39:20.730
That's all you get, Scott.
Seventy-two hours.

39:20.943 --> 39:22.228
What if I can't?

39:22.486 --> 39:25.944
Oh, come on, McCall.
That's not a winning attitude.

39:26.156 --> 39:27.111
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

39:27.366 --> 39:31.279
FINSTOCK: Let's go! Huddle up!
Let's go! Big night! Big night!

39:45.133 --> 39:46.589
That one. That's Jackson.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.846
Holy hotness.

39:50.013 --> 39:54.632
Oh, if I was in high school again...
Maybe just a substitute teacher.

39:54.852 --> 39:55.967
You are sick.

39:56.186 --> 39:59.223
(CHUCKLES) You should be all over that.

40:04.903 --> 40:09.112
Chris, you remember how
we were talking about a second Beta?

40:09.533 --> 40:10.989
A younger one?

40:11.201 --> 40:12.156
Yes.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.156
Can you get turned by a scratch?

40:16.707 --> 40:20.575
If the claws go deep enough. Maybe.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.589
Wonder how deep those went.

40:25.549 --> 40:26.584
FINSTOCK: Ready?

40:26.800 --> 40:27.664
PLAYERS: Yeah!

40:27.885 --> 40:31.002
FINSTOCK: Say it so they can hear it!
Hands in.

40:31.847 --> 40:33.087
What are we?

40:33.348 --> 40:34.554
ALL: We are lacrosse!

40:34.766 --> 40:36.893
That's right, take the field! Let's go!

40:37.102 --> 40:39.559
(ALL CHEERING)
