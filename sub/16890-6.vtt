08:53.700 --> 08:56.287
Then through the power
of Pinot Noir,

08:56.370 --> 09:00.249
he's transformed
into what the French call...

09:00.332 --> 09:02.709
[gibberish]

09:02.834 --> 09:04.628
Ripped from the headlines.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.380
Ah.

09:06.464 --> 09:07.506
Here...

09:09.674 --> 09:11.885
[upbeat music]

09:11.969 --> 09:13.011
[screams]

09:13.095 --> 09:14.179
Oh, I'm out of here.

09:14.263 --> 09:15.764
No!
No, no, no, no, no!

09:15.847 --> 09:17.599
You have to help me.
I have to finish my video.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.017
I love you, Titus,

09:19.101 --> 09:20.519
but this is
a billionaire's house,

09:20.602 --> 09:21.937
and I got priors.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.105
Lillian!

09:23.188 --> 09:24.398
Lillian, wait!

09:25.524 --> 09:26.608
Eight Ball, it's me.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.736
If anyone asks,
I've been with you all day.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.239
"I am screwed.

09:32.323 --> 09:34.074
My house is trashed
from last night

09:34.158 --> 09:35.409
and parents
are coming home.

09:35.493 --> 09:37.161
Help me clean up!"

09:37.244 --> 09:39.037
"Can't. Dylan said
I could smoke with them at park

09:39.121 --> 09:40.498
if I showed my boobs."

09:40.580 --> 09:41.915
"My dad's gonna kill me"

09:41.999 --> 09:44.168
"Sorry, blushing face.
Thumbs up."

09:44.251 --> 09:48.588
"BTW, lollipop, snowman,
toilet, mailbox, ghost."

09:48.672 --> 09:52.092
"Apple, woman's shoe,
alarm clock, acorn."

09:52.176 --> 09:54.594
"So true."

09:54.678 --> 09:56.721
Come on, Spirit Gum.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.266
If you can keep
Obama's human mask on

09:59.350 --> 10:01.435
over his lizard face,
hashtag lizard truth,

10:01.519 --> 10:03.228
surely you can do this.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.355
[door opens, closes]

10:05.814 --> 10:06.982
Who the hell are you?

10:07.065 --> 10:10.361
I am a handyman...

10:10.444 --> 10:13.572
hired by Jacqueline
to fix this curtain rod

10:13.655 --> 10:15.824
with my tools
from my tool sash.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.742
Right.
That reminds me--

10:17.826 --> 10:20.787
there's actually a few more
things she wants you to fix...

10:20.871 --> 10:22.247
today.

10:22.331 --> 10:26.877
Well, that's what I do
for my job.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.005
[high-pitched voice]
Damn, girl!

10:30.088 --> 10:31.631
[clears throat, deep voice]
Damn, girl.

10:39.515 --> 10:40.724
Hey, kid.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.227
No gum.
Spit it out.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.857
Hey, Mr. L.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.942
I was just thinking
about our conversation earlier.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.694
I know that being a teacher
isn't easy,

10:52.777 --> 10:54.154
especially when you're
trying to get through to kids

10:54.238 --> 10:55.573
who don't even want
to be here.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.990
Look, I could
stand here all day

10:57.074 --> 10:58.576
and stare at the reflection
of your can

10:58.658 --> 11:00.702
in the water fountain,
but I'm kind of busy.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.287
The kids leave
all kinds of things behind

11:02.371 --> 11:04.122
when there's a fire drill,
so...

11:04.206 --> 11:05.916
But I do want to be here.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.042
I want to learn.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.627
I just need your help.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.087
Sorry, Ginger.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.214
Nothing I do
is gonna make a difference.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.133
Nothing I've ever done
has made a difference.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.719
You know, I thought you
might say something like that.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.889
I dug this up
in the library,

11:20.972 --> 11:23.058
the P.S. Zero yearbook
from 1994,

11:23.141 --> 11:24.768
your third year
teaching here.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.854
Yeah, and a great year
to be a Montreal Expos fan.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.148
It was also the year
a graduating eighth-grader

11:30.232 --> 11:31.483
wrote this.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.527
"Off to
Winston Zeddemore High,

11:33.611 --> 11:35.529
all thanks to Mr. Lefkovitz.

11:35.613 --> 11:38.031
I'll never forget
what you did."

11:39.408 --> 11:41.243
Didn't make a difference, huh?

11:41.326 --> 11:44.955
You touched a boy
and made him a man.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.457
And that man is here today.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.917
Mike, come on out!

11:50.502 --> 11:52.546
Oh, crap.
Is that Mike Stampone?

11:52.630 --> 11:54.381
You got so big.

11:54.465 --> 11:55.591
You son of a bitch.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.884
You ruined my life!

12:00.220 --> 12:02.431
Wait!
But the yearbook!

12:02.514 --> 12:04.224
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Thanks.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.602
Please, Mr. Stampone!

12:07.519 --> 12:08.604
[grunting]

12:08.687 --> 12:10.188
Ow. Ow.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.489
Oh.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.618
Titus...

12:22.701 --> 12:24.244
I got to go back for him.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.374
[gasps]

12:29.458 --> 12:31.168
I said I'm going.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.342
Look, not for nothing,

12:38.425 --> 12:40.678
but this was
your stepmom's party?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.554
Yeah, well,
bitches be trippin'.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.056
Hey, you respect
your stepmom.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.267
She step gave birth to you.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.979
[gasps] Oh, no, magic hour...

12:52.022 --> 12:55.775
the time of day
when actors photograph best,

12:55.859 --> 12:58.487
according to my queer cousin.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.365
I'll be back.
You stay here.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.454
Last shot.
Action, genius.

13:07.538 --> 13:11.291
♪ Pinot Noir ♪

13:11.375 --> 13:13.669
What the WTF are you doing?

13:13.752 --> 13:16.087
I can explain.
You're in The Matrix.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.922
Titus, I should
never have left--

13:18.006 --> 13:20.008
Oh, you're in The Matrix.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.385
I already used The Matrix.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.679
Yeah, I'm calling
the police.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.597
You trust those clowns.
Are you kidding me?

13:25.681 --> 13:27.265
You got rights
in your own home.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.975
Shoot us.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.603
Okay, look,
I'm not a handyman,

13:31.687 --> 13:34.189
although that was my nickname
one summer on Fire Island.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.941
We're friends with Kimmy.
She asked us to come here to--

13:37.025 --> 13:39.194
Wait, wait.
Kimmy let you in?

13:39.277 --> 13:40.404
[both] Yeah.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.572
This is perfect.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.031
She is so fired.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.449
Fired?

13:44.533 --> 13:46.326
I wish I'd never
seen that Pug.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.869
Is that why you came back?

13:47.952 --> 13:50.372
That dog does not look
like me, Lillian.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.998
One time I had to wear a cone

13:52.082 --> 13:55.168
- because I kept biting my stitches.
- He was eating out of a pizza box.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.503
Oh, my God.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.962
When my dad finds out
about this,

13:58.046 --> 13:59.964
it's bye-bye
Little Dorkphan Annie.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.133
Okay, first of all,
that was weak.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.927
Second of all,
you mess with Kimmy,

14:04.010 --> 14:05.721
and your daddy will find out

14:05.804 --> 14:07.765
about you and your friends
trashing his home last night.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.641
[scoffs]
You can't prove that.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.309
Oh, really?

14:11.393 --> 14:13.186
Because I don't think
Jacqueline and her friends

14:13.270 --> 14:14.605
drink cans of beer

14:14.688 --> 14:16.732
while wearing
Slutsicle Orange lipstick

14:16.815 --> 14:18.776
from Ke$ha's
Morning After Collection,

14:18.858 --> 14:21.612
available exclusively
at Hess gas stations.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.363
My dad cannot find out
about this, please!

14:23.447 --> 14:24.864
He'll kill me.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.784
Or marry me off to one
of his Saudi friends.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.619
That's some high stakes.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.412
All right,
I'll make you this deal.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.289
We'll help you
clean up your party.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.040
You lay off Kimmy.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.293
Okay.
Detente.

14:36.376 --> 14:40.338
No, no, no, this is Titus.
DeTante moved back to Atlanta.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.090
[groaning]

14:42.173 --> 14:45.427
This was the only thing
in the nurse's office.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.178
Yeah, that's the nurse.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.639
Budget cuts.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.056
They've got
a cardboard cutout

14:50.140 --> 14:52.309
of Michael Jordan
teaching gym.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.812
- Ugh.
- I'm sorry about Mike Stampone.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.647
I thought you were his hero.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.774
His yearbook page said he went
to high school because of you.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.984
Yeah, he went to the worst
high school in New York City

15:01.067 --> 15:02.402
because of me.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.195
He was actually accepted
to Bronx Science.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.947
I was his advisor.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.741
I'm supposed to send this form
so he could go there.

15:07.825 --> 15:09.200
Anyway, I didn't.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.035
I steamed the stamp
off his envelope

15:11.119 --> 15:13.831
so that I could send a fan
letter to Beverly D'Angelo.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.625
Wait. You've always
been like this?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.836
A Fangelo?
Yeah, ever since Vacation.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.672
No!
A teacher who doesn't care.

15:21.755 --> 15:22.964
Oh, really?

15:23.047 --> 15:25.676
Really,
Miss Whatever-Your-Name-Is?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.678
Would a teacher
who doesn't care

15:27.761 --> 15:30.972
bring in Rising Sun
for today's class?

15:31.055 --> 15:33.183
- That's Major League.
- Damn it!

15:33.266 --> 15:34.685
See, this is what happens

15:34.768 --> 15:36.436
when you pack
your briefcase in the dark.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.979
But the people
who own the house

15:38.062 --> 15:39.481
don't know I'm living
in the basement.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.817
So life's full
of little compromises.

15:41.900 --> 15:45.320
I can't believe I tried
to keep you from getting fired.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.780
Fired?
I can't get fired.

15:46.864 --> 15:48.156
I've got tenure.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.324
Well, Deborah in the office

15:49.407 --> 15:51.201
says one more S-C-R-E-W-up,

15:51.284 --> 15:52.870
and you'll never teach again.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.954
Did she say that?

15:55.038 --> 15:57.957
What were her words exactly?
This is fantastic!

15:58.041 --> 15:59.376
What is wrong with you?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.960
Why are you happy about that?

16:01.044 --> 16:03.714
Why? Because it brings me
one step closer...

16:03.797 --> 16:05.048
to this.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.174
To this what?

16:06.257 --> 16:07.634
I forgot what you said earlier,

16:07.718 --> 16:09.219
'cause it took so long
to get up here.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.470
You kept having to lie down
in the stairwell,

16:10.554 --> 16:11.596
and then I had
to get you juice.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.264
You asked why I was happy.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.851
And I said, "'cause it leads me
one step closer."

16:15.934 --> 16:19.020
And then I said,
"To this."

16:19.103 --> 16:20.146
[Kimmy]
What?

16:20.230 --> 16:21.398
It's just at teachers' lounge.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.066
Just a teachers' lounge.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.860
Like the Montreal Expos

16:24.943 --> 16:27.905
are just Canada's
second-best baseball team.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.072
Well, used to be.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.908
The Expos moved?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.577
See, it's almost impossible
to fire a tenured teacher.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.370
So, if you're
too incompetent to teach,

16:35.453 --> 16:36.914
they send you here.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.582
The union calls it
"The Rubber Room."

16:38.665 --> 16:41.209
You get paid
to sit around all day

16:41.292 --> 16:44.045
till they figure out
what to do with you.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.214
It takes years.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.424
Oh, my gosh.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.384
You're trying to get sent here.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.761
And I'm so close.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.846
I've spent 23 years
failing my way

16:52.930 --> 16:55.348
from AP Science
all the way down

16:55.432 --> 16:59.436
to the last rung of
the teaching ladder-- GED Prep.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.729
You're not gonna
get away with this.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.063
I'm telling the principal.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.607
Yes, do that.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.108
It'll be great for you.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.026
'Cause he'll probably
replace me

17:07.110 --> 17:09.738
with one of those
inspirational GED teachers

17:09.821 --> 17:11.573
you're always hearing about.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.991
Nice try, Teach.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.494
Or should I say,
"Reverse Teach"?

17:16.578 --> 17:18.204
If I complain, you get paid
to sit in there,

17:18.288 --> 17:20.039
and I get nothing.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.584
They're not gonna replace you.
The school's broke.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.210
They've been renting out
the lockers as hotel rooms

17:24.294 --> 17:25.336
for Japanese businessmen.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.172
Konnichiwa.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.218
You complain, I win.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.429
You fail, I win.

17:34.512 --> 17:37.808
Face it, Missy,
I'm a winner!

17:37.891 --> 17:39.768
Well, I'm not giving up!

17:40.894 --> 17:42.646
Did Frederick Douglass
give up when people told him,

17:42.729 --> 17:45.023
"You'll never invent
peanut butter, pal"?

17:45.106 --> 17:46.608
I know all of that's wrong.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.902
I see now that he's holding
a tennis racket.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.116
I can't believe those guys.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.452
I told them to stay
out of my dad's study.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.705
Ugh. Wait till you see
what they did to your bathrooms.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.540
Who's that mean old lady?

18:02.624 --> 18:04.334
What?
Oh, no.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.794
That's, like,
my super-great-grandfather,

18:05.877 --> 18:07.004
Christoph Voorhees.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.379
Ugh, the Dutch.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.715
I never formed
an opinion about them.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.551
We also have his ivory legs
and his mustache

18:13.635 --> 18:15.178
and the pipe he smoked
as a baby.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.721
Ivory legs.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.222
Where's the pipe?

18:19.557 --> 18:21.267
No!
No, no, no, no.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.978
My dad will notice right away
if this thing is missing.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.771
Where is it?

18:24.855 --> 18:27.899
Okay, I often find that things
are in the last place I look.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.735
So let's start
at the Dollywood gift shop.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.988
Who here is allowed
to rent a car?

18:33.071 --> 18:36.282
No. I know exactly
where it is.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.076
And she stepped
on the ball.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.410
[laughter]

18:39.494 --> 18:41.579
[Titus]
Hey, son! That's my pipe!

18:42.706 --> 18:43.748
No, it's not.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.458
- What did you just call me?
- Give it to him, Dylan.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.584
[Italian accent]
You talking to me?

18:46.668 --> 18:47.711
I break-a your face.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.215
- Let's get out of here!
- Ooh!

18:52.298 --> 18:53.884
Oh, my God, thank you--

18:53.967 --> 18:55.593
Not so fast,
MTV's Daria.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.387
Solid, T.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.181
I give this back to you,
Kimmy's off the hook, right?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.559
Yes, fine.
Pinkie promise.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.185
I don't get you guys.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.937
You did all this for Kimmy?

19:06.021 --> 19:07.480
She's the worst.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.440
Sure, she's not perfect.

19:09.524 --> 19:12.069
She smiles too much,
like a collie.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.029
And red hair, brown eyes?

19:14.112 --> 19:16.197
Guess God ran out of crayons.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.533
But he wasn't out
of whatever makes people good.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.452
Freckles, maybe.
She's a good friend.

19:21.536 --> 19:24.039
Yeah. And what do you know
about friendship anyway?

19:24.122 --> 19:26.541
Those kids
you hang out with suck.

19:26.624 --> 19:27.834
[scoffs]
Whatever.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.168
You don't know them.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.795
Oh.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.672
[Titus sighs]
Yeah.

19:32.756 --> 19:36.009
By the way, I counted
12 bathrooms in your house.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.385
Did I miss any?

19:37.468 --> 19:38.720
No, there's only eight.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.931
Run, Lillian!

19:42.306 --> 19:44.017
[Lou Brown]
She put this team together

19:44.101 --> 19:45.810
because she thought
we'd be bad enough

19:45.894 --> 19:47.645
to finish dead last,

19:47.729 --> 19:49.355
knocking attendance
down to the point

19:49.439 --> 19:52.275
where she could move
the team to Miami.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.695
Well, then I guess there's
only one thing left to do.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.196
What's that?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.282
- Win the whole...
- [snores]

19:59.365 --> 20:01.200
...thing.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.369
That's it.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.537
Guys, there's something
you should know.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.998
Mr. Lefkovitz wants us to fail.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.291
Teacher want us to fail?

20:08.374 --> 20:10.293
You make-a no sense, Penis.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.836
Our success is his glory.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.546
Yeah, that makes no sense
at all.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.048
- What are you talking about?
- Hear me out.

20:15.132 --> 20:16.591
If we've learned anything
in this class,

20:16.674 --> 20:18.051
it's the plot to the movie
Major League.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.177
Wait. What?

20:19.260 --> 20:21.138
Mr. Phelps' widow
wants the team to fail

20:21.220 --> 20:22.973
so she can move
the franchise to Miami, right?

20:23.056 --> 20:26.434
Well, Mr. L wants us to fail
so he never has to work again.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.894
He's Phelps' widow.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.395
The Rubber Room is Miami.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.898
And I guess the school
is Cleveland.

20:31.982 --> 20:33.232
- Oh.
- Yeah.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.193
Oh, still alive.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.320
What's going on?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.405
You, you, with the talking,
sit down!

20:39.489 --> 20:42.033
I'm sorry, my roommate
had to use the pants.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.660
I thought there was
no way to beat him,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.286
but I was wrong,

20:45.369 --> 20:47.413
'cause we're all
in this together, same as them.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.415
We just have to do
what Jake Taylor said.

20:49.499 --> 20:50.541
What's that?

20:50.625 --> 20:52.335
Pass the whole fudging test.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.837
No!

20:53.920 --> 20:56.173
So we work together
for the common good,

20:56.255 --> 21:00.301
the same way Vietnam win
the war of American Aggression.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.386
Yes, but read the room, Dong.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.723
Now, who's with me?

21:05.807 --> 21:08.185
[all cheering]

21:08.267 --> 21:10.645
Thanks for the lesson,
Teach.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.064
