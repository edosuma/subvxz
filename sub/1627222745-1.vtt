He shot a police officer.
Have you seen him?

53:16.583 --> 53:17.583
Oh, that guy!

53:18.083 --> 53:20.083
-[woman speaks Greek]
-[man] Where did you see him?

53:20.166 --> 53:26.833
[Eleni speaks Greek]

53:26.916 --> 53:28.125
[woman shouts in Greek]

53:36.416 --> 53:39.375
We're going to drive a little out of town,
and then we let you out.

53:39.458 --> 53:40.916
If you hear me, knock once.

53:41.583 --> 53:42.416
[knocks]

53:42.500 --> 53:44.916
[breathing heavily]

53:47.333 --> 53:49.333
[car doors close]

53:51.041 --> 53:54.166
-[Eleni] What are we supposed to do now?
-[woman 2] Start it.

53:54.250 --> 53:56.583
[Eleni] I don't like this at all.
I'm scared.

53:56.666 --> 53:58.625
-[woman 2] Just drive. Okay?
-[engine starts, revs]

53:58.708 --> 53:59.666
[Eleni] Okay, okay.

53:59.750 --> 54:01.833
[woman 2] Everything's all right now.
It's fine.

54:14.750 --> 54:18.291
[Eleni speaking Greek]

54:18.375 --> 54:19.416
[mouthing]

54:22.166 --> 54:23.208
Was she angry?

54:23.291 --> 54:25.875
She'll understand
when we tell her everything later.

54:25.958 --> 54:27.916
She said to meet at Alex's shop.

54:28.500 --> 54:30.666
Alex's shop?
I don't remember where that is.

54:30.750 --> 54:33.958
On Pireos Street, by the hands.
The praying hands.

54:34.958 --> 54:37.333
I can take that off if you like.

54:38.416 --> 54:39.333
Thank you.

54:40.250 --> 54:43.041
[rustling, zipping]

54:45.500 --> 54:48.125
Okay. Hold still.

54:48.208 --> 54:49.041
[grunts]

54:52.416 --> 54:54.791
You better not be lying to us
about any of this.

54:55.375 --> 54:57.083
I'm not that creative. Believe me.

54:57.958 --> 55:00.708
Well, you left out the part
about shooting a cop.

55:00.791 --> 55:04.041
No. No, no, I didn't shoot him.
Okay, well, I didn't mean to shoot him.

55:04.125 --> 55:07.541
He was drawing his gun on me.
I was just trying to get away from him.

55:07.625 --> 55:08.875
It was only his foot.

55:09.666 --> 55:10.625
What a relief.

55:11.208 --> 55:14.041
The woman you were talking to,
is she… is she police too?

55:14.666 --> 55:15.500
No.

55:16.208 --> 55:18.333
I had to deal with enough police
in my life

55:18.416 --> 55:20.291
to know that she was something else.

55:22.458 --> 55:23.416
But she was armed.

55:24.791 --> 55:27.375
-Okay. Hold it.
-[Beckett gasps]

55:31.666 --> 55:32.958
-This will help.
-[Beckett groans]

55:36.916 --> 55:38.125
Are we in danger?

55:41.125 --> 55:41.958
Are we?

55:46.166 --> 55:48.833
They know where I'm trying to go.
They'll be waiting.

55:49.458 --> 55:51.500
So, we have to be very, very careful.

55:56.416 --> 55:58.416
[man speaking Greek over radio]

56:05.416 --> 56:06.750
[woman speaking Greek over radio]

56:06.833 --> 56:10.875
[Eleni] They're discussing the kidnapping.
The possible political motivations.

56:10.958 --> 56:11.958
Nothing new.

56:15.375 --> 56:16.791
It has to be them, right?

56:17.333 --> 56:18.208
Maybe.

56:18.916 --> 56:20.041
We don't know.

56:20.125 --> 56:22.583
[Eleni] She was armed.
He said they have cop connections.

56:23.583 --> 56:27.208
She certainly looked like a fascist,
and they have Dimos.

56:27.291 --> 56:29.375
Do you know
who these people could possibly be?

56:29.458 --> 56:31.958
Well, there's a group called Sunrise.

56:32.041 --> 56:35.291
They're far-right,
ultranationalist Greeks.

56:35.833 --> 56:39.208
They have the police in their pocket.
They get away with everything.

56:39.708 --> 56:42.416
So far, no one has claimed responsibility
for the kidnapping,

56:42.500 --> 56:44.541
but it's very likely to be them.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.541
The boy's uncle
understands people's anger.

56:49.625 --> 56:52.708
He's building a coalition to reverse
the austerity measures imposed on Greece

56:52.791 --> 56:55.958
by the European Union
and bring us out of the current bullshit.

56:56.041 --> 56:57.750
That's if he gets elected.

56:57.833 --> 57:01.291
And that's why we're going to Athens,
because there's a rally for Karras

57:01.375 --> 57:02.791
for the upcoming elections.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.416
Wait, where's the rally?

57:07.208 --> 57:08.541
Syntagma Square. Why?

57:10.250 --> 57:13.708
[Eleni] A lot of people think they're
trying to scare him into stepping down,

57:13.791 --> 57:17.500
and the police, I hope they do
what they have to and protect him.

57:17.583 --> 57:19.750
[breathing heavily]

57:22.583 --> 57:23.583
Are you okay?

57:24.458 --> 57:27.416
-[Beckett hyperventilating]
-Beckett, breathe.

57:27.500 --> 57:30.333
-[Eleni] Should I pull over?
-No. No, no. Go on.

57:30.416 --> 57:32.416
[Beckett continues hyperventilating]

57:40.833 --> 57:42.958
It's okay, you're in the car. You're safe.

57:44.500 --> 57:45.666
Okay? Breathe.

57:45.750 --> 57:47.333
[breathes deeply]

57:47.416 --> 57:48.291
Breathe.

57:48.875 --> 57:51.166
-[breathing slows]
-[melancholy music playing]

58:00.625 --> 58:02.750
[woman 2] What happened
to your girlfriend?

58:04.083 --> 58:07.583
[Beckett gasps] We weren't supposed
to be on that road.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.666
We were staying at Syntagma Square.
Our balcony overlooked it.

58:17.291 --> 58:20.083
Somebody told us
that there was a protest coming.

58:23.041 --> 58:25.333
Then they… they told us
it was gonna be very loud,

58:25.416 --> 58:26.958
so, you know, we… we…

58:31.291 --> 58:32.166
We left.

58:38.958 --> 58:40.458
[woman 2] You should lie down.

58:40.541 --> 58:42.500
-[breathing heavily]
-Lie down.

58:44.458 --> 58:45.916
We still have some way to go.

58:48.166 --> 58:49.125
[exhales deeply]

58:52.791 --> 58:55.458
[woman 2] It's okay. It's okay.

59:09.875 --> 59:12.708
[woman 2] We need to remember
where that is, Alex's shop.

59:13.791 --> 59:15.458
[continues speaking indistinctly]

59:28.791 --> 59:29.625
Oh!

59:30.708 --> 59:31.666
Are you okay?

59:33.708 --> 59:35.083
Here, take this.

59:37.291 --> 59:40.458
-[Eleni] What's this?
-What's going on? Is there an accident?

59:40.541 --> 59:43.250
[Eleni] I don't know.
There's police on the road.

59:43.333 --> 59:44.166
[men shouting]

59:44.250 --> 59:45.750
[Eleni] They're checking cars.

59:47.125 --> 59:48.291
What do we do now?

59:49.458 --> 59:51.875
You don't think
it has something to do with him?

59:54.583 --> 59:55.416
Thank you.

59:57.500 --> 1:00:01.208
-[people shouting in Greek]

[Greek music playing in background]

1:01:23.708 --> 1:01:26.000
-Hi. Hi.
-[man] Can I help you?

1:01:26.750 --> 1:01:28.875
Yes, the US Embassy, please.

1:01:28.958 --> 1:01:31.541
-[man] Omonia Station.
-No, the US Embassy.

1:01:31.625 --> 1:01:35.750
[man] Omonia Station. You want
a 90-minute ticket or a 24-hour ticket?

1:01:36.666 --> 1:01:37.500
Ninety.

1:01:39.125 --> 1:01:40.250
[man] One euro and 20.

[soft music plays]

1:05:58.208 --> 1:06:00.666

-[woman] I'm so sorry.

[Majessy] Beckett.

1:06:17.041 --> 1:06:19.458
I'm Steve Majessy. We spoke on the phone.

1:06:21.875 --> 1:06:22.708
Oh.

1:06:24.416 --> 1:06:27.541
We're gonna get you cleaned up.
We're gonna get you better.

1:06:27.625 --> 1:06:29.083
Don't worry about it.

1:06:29.166 --> 1:06:30.000
Thank you.

1:06:35.791 --> 1:06:37.333
[sighs]

1:06:44.125 --> 1:06:46.916
[man] You know he doesn't know
about that yet. Poor guy.

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.750
-Yes. I gotta go. I will. Bye.
-[footsteps approaching]

1:06:51.458 --> 1:06:52.291
Beckett.

1:06:53.666 --> 1:06:54.666
Stephen Tynan.

1:06:55.333 --> 1:06:56.375
[Beckett groans] Hi.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.625
I hear you've been through hell.

1:07:00.416 --> 1:07:01.583
First things first…

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.000
April Hanson.

1:07:05.916 --> 1:07:07.000
We located her.

1:07:08.458 --> 1:07:12.375
Apparently, the office
in Ioannina refused the body.

1:07:12.458 --> 1:07:15.500
When they found out she was
a US citizen, contacted us.

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:17.750
So, she was brought to the embassy.

1:07:18.250 --> 1:07:20.416
She got here about an hour before you did.

1:07:21.625 --> 1:07:24.208
-She's here? She's here in this building?
-[Tynan] Yes.

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:27.208
We'll help arrange everything
to get her back home.

1:07:27.291 --> 1:07:29.083
We've already been in contact
with her parents,

1:07:29.166 --> 1:07:32.916
which is legal for us to do
in a complicated case like this.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:33.833
[clears throat]

1:07:34.958 --> 1:07:36.541
Um, I need to see her.

1:07:38.208 --> 1:07:39.291
[Tynan] Absolutely.

1:07:40.041 --> 1:07:41.458
Would you come with me?

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:26.500
[Beckett inhales deeply]

1:08:35.541 --> 1:08:37.041
I wanna bring her home.

1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:39.500
[Tynan] Of course.

1:08:39.583 --> 1:08:42.333
Uh, as soon as that's possible,
given what's happening.

1:08:51.458 --> 1:08:53.291
I'm so sorry for your loss, Beckett.

1:08:53.791 --> 1:08:56.625
[sighs] Let's just talk,
get all this straight.

1:08:56.708 --> 1:09:00.125
Now, the sooner we do that, the sooner
we can get you both back on your way.

1:09:00.208 --> 1:09:02.208

1:10:01.375 --> 1:10:03.958
[mumbling]

1:10:07.375 --> 1:10:10.166
So… you were saying?

1:10:13.416 --> 1:10:17.416
Um… then, uh, I crawled out of the car,

1:10:18.083 --> 1:10:21.125
and that's when I saw the redheaded boy.

1:10:23.125 --> 1:10:25.291
A couple days later, I… I went back there.

1:10:25.375 --> 1:10:27.333
You went back there? Why?

1:10:40.333 --> 1:10:41.166
To see.

1:10:42.541 --> 1:10:43.666
[Tynan] To see what?

1:10:49.041 --> 1:10:50.916
I didn't know what I had to do.

1:10:56.416 --> 1:10:57.708
I went back there…

1:11:01.416 --> 1:11:02.833
because that was the place…

1:11:04.833 --> 1:11:05.750
where I…

1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:19.791
[gasps] It was my fault.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.250
The accident, it was, uh…

1:11:30.333 --> 1:11:31.458
It was my fault.

1:11:40.333 --> 1:11:42.666
And… and then, um…

1:11:43.833 --> 1:11:46.500
[sniffs] …uh, that's where they found me.

1:11:49.583 --> 1:11:53.041
A woman and a cop,
they… they started shooting at me.

1:11:53.125 --> 1:11:55.958
And I… on sight, and I just… I just ran.

1:11:56.541 --> 1:11:57.708
And they followed me,

1:11:57.791 --> 1:12:01.250

into a house that I was hiding in.

1:12:01.333 --> 1:12:04.041

what… what they did to the man there

1:12:04.125 --> 1:12:06.958

at the time. Uh…

1:12:08.291 --> 1:12:10.208

there at the station.

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:18.791

1:12:20.291 --> 1:12:22.416
Well… [clears throat]

1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:24.208
How did you get to Athens?

1:12:25.083 --> 1:12:28.833
Uh, I got a ride,
uh, a couple of activists.

1:12:30.666 --> 1:12:33.000
They were headed
to the, uh… the Karras rally.

1:12:33.083 --> 1:12:36.166
That's the reason
I found out who the boy was.

1:12:36.250 --> 1:12:38.500
They said
that the… the people that were chasing me

1:12:38.583 --> 1:12:40.791
were part of a group, uh, called, uh,

1:12:41.583 --> 1:12:44.083
uh, Sunrise. Or… or Pro-Sunrise.

1:12:44.666 --> 1:12:46.833

1:12:56.041 --> 1:12:59.083
[Tynan] Hmm.
And do you think Lena and Eleni

1:12:59.166 --> 1:13:02.458
would go to the police
on their own or the press?

1:13:03.166 --> 1:13:04.041
I… I don't know.

1:13:04.791 --> 1:13:06.958
[Tynan] Well, if I wanted to find them,
could I?

1:13:07.458 --> 1:13:09.791

from them anyway. [inhales]

1:13:19.458 --> 1:13:23.166
They said, um… they said
they were going to meet at a shop,

1:13:23.250 --> 1:13:25.083
uh, near the praying hands.

1:13:25.958 --> 1:13:28.208

do you know what that means?

1:13:28.291 --> 1:13:30.416

that's after you.

The activists think that because
it suits their political narrative.

They also think they can wave
a magic crisis wand called Karras,

1:13:46.958 --> 1:13:49.916

will just go away.

You know, it doesn't work that way.

1:14:24.458 --> 1:14:26.625

to leave the embassy.
