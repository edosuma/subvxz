WEBVTT

00:46.419 --> 00:47.847
<i>No, no, you're not wrong.</i>

00:47.982 --> 00:49.884
<i>That really is</i>
<i>a maniacal killer clown</i>

00:50.020 --> 00:52.522
<i>trying to smash my head in</i>
<i>with a brick on a stick.</i>

00:52.924 --> 00:55.493
<i>So how did I find myself</i>
<i>in this situation? You ask.</i>

00:55.629 --> 00:58.598
<i>Well, for that...</i>
<i>I'm gonna need to take you back.</i>

01:05.536 --> 01:06.633
<i>You ever been on holiday</i>

01:07.202 --> 01:09.743
<i>and you're just trying</i>
<i>to drink in some sunshine,</i>

01:09.879 --> 01:11.610
<i>knock back a beer or 12,</i>

01:11.746 --> 01:15.477
<i>only to have your own little</i>
<i>slice of Shangri-la drowned out</i>

01:15.913 --> 01:19.615
<i>by a gyrating colony</i>
<i>of gurning pillheads?</i>

01:20.382 --> 01:21.518
<i>Well, I have.</i>

01:27.293 --> 01:31.497
<i>I blame those</i>
<i>iPod shuffling DJ dickheads</i>
<i>like this one here.</i>

01:31.999 --> 01:33.600
Can I have some noise?

01:36.873 --> 01:40.371
These spirals are fucking shit.
Give me something better,
something bigger.

01:40.506 --> 01:42.205
Don't think that's
a good idea, boss.

01:42.708 --> 01:44.378
There's too much gas pressure.
It could be dan--

01:44.513 --> 01:47.610
Do it now. DJ Remy doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

01:48.111 --> 01:49.178
Whatever.

01:56.258 --> 01:59.226
-We're good to go.
-The fucking time.

02:04.429 --> 02:06.432
Who's ready for some big bands?

02:08.063 --> 02:12.206
Can we have a liftoff?
In three, two, one...

02:27.955 --> 02:30.521
<i>So when this particular DJ</i>
<i>dickhead's promoter</i>

02:30.656 --> 02:32.491
<i>decided to put</i>
<i>a bounty on his head</i>

02:32.626 --> 02:34.928
<i>because he signed</i>
<i>with the competition,</i>

02:35.063 --> 02:37.198
<i>I was more than happy to oblige.</i>

02:39.232 --> 02:40.764
<i>Yeah, it's a dirty job.</i>

02:40.900 --> 02:42.101
<i>-But in case you've forgotten...</i>

02:42.236 --> 02:43.501
<i>...I'm happy to get my hands</i>

02:43.636 --> 02:45.769
<i>bleeding filthy</i>
<i>for the right price.</i>

02:45.905 --> 02:48.200
<i>And if there's one thing</i>
<i>I think we can all agree on,</i>

02:48.336 --> 02:51.909
<i>is that some arseholes</i>
<i>really do deserve to die.</i>

03:12.366 --> 03:15.131
<i> Needed to keep</i>
<i>my head down after</i>
<i>what happened back in London.</i>

03:15.633 --> 03:19.703
<i>So I grabbed my fake passports,</i>
<i>and dicky credit cards,</i>
<i>rode straight to Heathrow</i>

03:19.839 --> 03:21.635
<i>and hopped on the first flight</i>
<i>to anywhere,</i>

03:21.770 --> 03:23.607
<i>which turned out to be Malta,</i>

03:24.076 --> 03:27.113
<i>which was great for a bit</i>
<i>of the old soul searching.</i>

03:27.248 --> 03:28.546
<i>I've got to confess, though,</i>

03:28.681 --> 03:30.009
<i>I was a bit pissed off</i>
<i>when I found out</i>

03:30.144 --> 03:31.880
<i>that Maltesers</i>
<i>weren't even from here,</i>

03:32.015 --> 03:33.951
<i>and they don't even</i>
<i>bleedin' sell 'em...</i>

03:34.087 --> 03:35.289
This is Malta!

03:36.586 --> 03:37.925
<i>...which is bullshit.</i>

03:38.861 --> 03:42.328
<i>But, that aside, I bloody love</i>
<i>this little Mediterranean jam.</i>

03:42.697 --> 03:45.699
<i>The sun always shines.</i>
<i>The beer flows freely.</i>

03:46.168 --> 03:49.666
<i>And with the Middle East,</i>
<i>Europe, and North Africa</i>
<i>just a puddle jump away,</i>

03:50.402 --> 03:52.071
<i>I can bump someone off in Dubai,</i>

03:52.574 --> 03:54.533
<i>and be back home</i>
<i>before match of the day starts.</i>

04:08.653 --> 04:11.189
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

04:11.324 --> 04:13.954
<i>♪ Aa, aa, aa, aa ♪</i>

04:46.960 --> 04:48.159
Oh, okay.

04:48.762 --> 04:50.793
I had a feeling
it was going to be tonight.

04:51.429 --> 04:52.962
So let's fucking have it!

05:49.353 --> 05:50.655
Good. Yeah.

06:18.650 --> 06:20.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus Christ,

06:20.854 --> 06:23.056
it's a brand new TV,
it is still okay! Hold it!

06:27.828 --> 06:30.260
Still got eight episodes
of<i> Bake Off</i> to watch.

06:30.896 --> 06:35.766
-Hiyah!
-Flamingo!

06:36.935 --> 06:39.501
Flamingo, flamingo!

06:39.637 --> 06:41.069
Jesus Christ, Siu-ling!

06:41.205 --> 06:43.403
You're paid to smash me up,
but not the apartment.

06:43.539 --> 06:46.409
I mean, look at the state of
this place. It's a rotten mess.

06:47.879 --> 06:49.208
You need to say
the safe word sooner

06:49.344 --> 06:50.710
if you want me to stop.
You think I can read

06:50.846 --> 06:52.385
your mind or something?

06:52.521 --> 06:53.815
You stupid!

06:54.217 --> 06:56.120
-<i> This is Siu-ling.</i>

06:56.255 --> 06:58.884
<i>Now she might look pretty sweet</i>
<i>and innocent at first glance.</i>

06:59.020 --> 07:02.463
<i>But, as you can see,</i>
<i>she's got some serious</i>
<i>anger management issues,</i>

07:02.598 --> 07:04.429
<i>and a right bloody sting</i>
<i>in her tail.</i>

07:04.564 --> 07:05.962
<i>Add to this, she's probably</i>

07:06.097 --> 07:08.462
<i>the best martial artist</i>
<i>I've ever tangled with.</i>

07:08.931 --> 07:10.170
Hey, get off me!

07:10.573 --> 07:11.835
<i>I first met her when she was</i>

07:11.970 --> 07:13.599
<i>a waitress</i>
<i>at the local dive bar.</i>

07:15.105 --> 07:16.605
<i>Now, apparently, she grew up</i>

07:16.740 --> 07:18.272
<i>on the main streets of Hong Kong</i>

07:18.408 --> 07:20.846
<i>and is a descendant</i>
<i>of the great Wong Fei-hung.</i>

07:21.415 --> 07:24.918
<i>Skilled in more</i>
<i>martial disciplines</i>
<i>than I've had hot dinners.</i>

07:26.054 --> 07:28.414
<i>If she gets out of the wrong</i>
<i>side of bed in the morning,</i>

07:28.550 --> 07:31.184
<i>there's no telling</i>
<i>what damage she's capable of.</i>

07:32.390 --> 07:33.290
Excuse me.

07:33.659 --> 07:34.957
How much they're
paying you here?

07:36.692 --> 07:37.795
Wanna a raise?

07:42.369 --> 07:43.668
I don't speak Cantonese.

07:43.804 --> 07:45.103
What are you saying?
Say it in English.

07:45.239 --> 07:46.872
Motherfucker!

07:47.941 --> 07:50.070
You need to speak up, Fallon.
You know the deal.

07:50.205 --> 07:52.205
You don't say "Flamingo,"
I don't stop.

07:52.340 --> 07:55.241
And I thought we agreed,
right, no nut shots.

07:55.377 --> 07:57.280
Do you remember that?
Well, what did you do?

07:57.416 --> 08:00.015
You tried to put them
up into orbit.
And what else did you do?

08:00.150 --> 08:01.885
You smashed the bleeding vase
off my pots.

08:02.020 --> 08:04.318
Look at the bloody TV.
You're out of your mind?

08:04.454 --> 08:08.424
Defense, you idiot! You need
to defend yourself at all times.

08:08.559 --> 08:09.459
Don't touch me.

08:10.362 --> 08:11.929
Well, look, you're going to have
to help me clean this place up,

08:12.064 --> 08:13.299
because I can't do it on my own,
haven't got time--

08:13.434 --> 08:14.664
What? You clean it yourself.

08:14.799 --> 08:16.599
I'm not your maid. I'm not here

08:16.734 --> 08:18.205
to clean your dirty sheets.

08:18.340 --> 08:20.741
I come here to fight. That's it!

08:21.477 --> 08:23.544
Now, where is my money,<i> gweilo?</i>

08:29.083 --> 08:29.979
Fine.

08:31.350 --> 08:32.245
Good, fine.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.788
Probably see you middle
of next week, then, yeah?

08:38.254 --> 08:41.259
Maybe. Or maybe
you'll see me sooner.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.993
You never know. Bye-bye.

08:53.307 --> 08:55.467
<i>I gotta be honest.</i>
<i>I lost my fair share of sleep</i>

08:55.602 --> 08:58.076
<i>over what I did</i>
<i>to my mates back in England.</i>

08:58.579 --> 09:01.709
<i>I sometimes wonder</i>
<i>if me taking a weekly kicking</i>
<i>from Siu-ling</i>

09:01.844 --> 09:05.344
<i>isn't just another</i>
<i>training session</i>
<i>and more like me paying penance</i>

09:05.480 --> 09:07.319
<i>for all that guilt</i>
<i>I'm holding on to.</i>

09:16.959 --> 09:18.992
Get the fuck out of my pub.

09:19.562 --> 09:21.962
<i>Ah, well, that was then.</i>
<i>This is now.</i>

09:22.097 --> 09:23.735
<i>I'm better off alone anyway.</i>

09:23.871 --> 09:26.872
It's me, myself,
and fucking I from now on.

09:27.475 --> 09:29.236
<i>No mates, no birds,</i>

09:29.371 --> 09:31.306
<i>no disgruntled assassin</i>
<i>father figure,</i>

09:31.441 --> 09:34.340
<i>and no one to let me down</i>
<i>or get in my way.</i>

09:38.183 --> 09:40.883
-Just leave.
-Let go of me!

09:41.019 --> 09:42.681
-Ge-- get his legs.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.487
-Someone...
Leave me alone!

09:48.694 --> 09:50.624
-Fred?

10:03.178 --> 10:04.037
Fry tonight!

10:04.173 --> 10:06.042
-Shit.

10:10.111 --> 10:12.946
-Looks like you pissed down
the wrong alley, Fred.

10:13.082 --> 10:15.150
Mike! What are you doing here?

10:16.350 --> 10:18.323
-I think you're right.
-Come on.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.385
Oh!

10:21.259 --> 10:23.856
Lucky you turned up
when you did.

10:23.991 --> 10:27.098
-I was just about to do
the other two.
-Yeah, looked like it.

10:27.233 --> 10:28.834
So why don't you tell me
what you're doing in the middle

10:28.969 --> 10:31.004
of Malta, Fred?
Setting people on fire?

10:31.139 --> 10:34.370
Oh, did you clock that cheeky
little gizmo I came up with?

10:34.505 --> 10:37.603
-Yeah, it was all right, that.
-That meathead got toasted.

10:37.739 --> 10:39.705
Yeah. Then the other two started
kicking the shit out of you.

10:39.841 --> 10:42.408
Very smooth that was, mate. So
what are you doing back there?

10:42.543 --> 10:43.943
Getting handsy
with the birds or something?

10:44.078 --> 10:45.516
No, nothing like that.

10:45.652 --> 10:47.018
I was looking for someone.

10:47.153 --> 10:49.349
Looking for someone?
Eh, you're looking for me.

10:50.251 --> 10:52.284
-Did Big Ray send you?
-No!

10:52.420 --> 10:53.991
I didn't even know
you was here. I--

10:54.126 --> 10:55.991
-Don't you be lying to me, Fred.
-No, for good.

10:56.127 --> 10:59.132
I, I don't speak
to Big Ray no more.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.332
Nobody does.

11:00.734 --> 11:02.532
-Ain't you heard?
-Heard what?

11:02.668 --> 11:04.565
Ray lost the Oasis.

11:04.934 --> 11:08.840
No one wanted to hire us
after you killed Milton
and all the others.

11:08.975 --> 11:10.806
It's funny,
but people stop calling

11:10.941 --> 11:12.745
when your firm gets a reputation

11:12.881 --> 11:15.045
for lobbing off the heads
of its clients.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.010
Don't guilt trip me on that one.
All right, Fred?

11:17.146 --> 11:18.077
Pete and Milton had it coming.

11:18.212 --> 11:19.377
And, well, the rest of them

11:19.513 --> 11:21.118
didn't give me much choice,
did they?

11:21.253 --> 11:23.856
You... you could have handled it
a little bit better.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.023
Probably right.

11:28.991 --> 11:31.831
-So Big Ray must be
fuming then, yeah?
-Well, you could say that.

11:31.966 --> 11:34.198
I don't know where your head
was at that time,

11:34.333 --> 11:37.268
but I think I'm beginning
to understand it a bit better.

11:37.404 --> 11:38.299
Mike...

11:39.441 --> 11:41.341
...I have fallen in love.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.201
-You what?
-Yes.

11:43.337 --> 11:45.405
I'm in love. I met this girl.

11:45.541 --> 11:47.709
She's the most beautiful girl
in the world.

11:47.845 --> 11:49.447
She's like an angel.

11:49.582 --> 11:51.818
Her name is Leylo.

11:53.221 --> 11:54.187
Oh.

11:54.623 --> 11:56.421
Pretty. Where'd you meet her?

11:57.424 --> 12:00.890
Well, that's it. Technically,
I haven't actually met her yet,

12:01.025 --> 12:02.955
but we've been chatting online.

12:03.525 --> 12:05.997
Internet, Fred.
My God, you have changed.

12:06.132 --> 12:09.296
Yeah. Finally plucked up
the courage to go online

12:09.432 --> 12:13.201
and Leylo emails me back
the very next day.

12:13.337 --> 12:15.103
Oh, just out of the blue
like that, was it?

12:15.239 --> 12:17.376
Well, that's
how love works, right?

12:17.511 --> 12:18.639
It's a scam, mate.

12:19.509 --> 12:22.447
That's what Big Ray said,
and you're both wrong.

12:22.582 --> 12:25.515
It's a bloody scam.
I bet she asked you
for money, didn't she?

12:25.651 --> 12:28.415
-What makes you say that?
-Because it's a bleedin' scam,
you dope.

12:28.550 --> 12:30.489
Tell me you
didn't give her any, please.

12:31.158 --> 12:34.025
Oh, you bloody well did,
didn't you? You stupid tit.

12:34.161 --> 12:35.722
-All right, come on.

12:35.857 --> 12:38.227
We've got to get you out of
there before the cops turn up.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.906
Eh, downstairs, mate.

12:47.041 --> 12:49.375
We've got the games room,
Jacuzzi down there,

12:49.511 --> 12:50.675
bedrooms over there,

12:50.811 --> 12:53.705
foosball, pool, satellite TV,

12:54.141 --> 12:55.446
all you need.

12:55.582 --> 12:56.681
Lovely, Mike.

12:57.150 --> 13:00.052
You always did like nice,
shiny things.

13:00.188 --> 13:02.015
Ah, you know me, mate.
I'll tell you what, though.

13:02.150 --> 13:04.521
You should have seen it
the other day.
It was a right bloody mess.

13:12.662 --> 13:15.966
God, I really need to invest
in a sponge coffee table.

13:16.102 --> 13:18.732
and shrieks]

13:21.105 --> 13:22.902
Shitzer, this ain't the time.

13:27.509 --> 13:29.074
What the hell?
You brought backup.

13:29.210 --> 13:30.717
-Stop it!
-Argh!

13:30.853 --> 13:32.616
I will kill you.

13:32.752 --> 13:34.715
Flamingo! Flamingo!

13:34.850 --> 13:35.955
Argh!

13:37.325 --> 13:38.221
Flamingo!

13:39.726 --> 13:42.423
Jesus Christ.

13:42.558 --> 13:44.490
Hasn't been a week already,
has it? Aah.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.195
No, but you did
so poorly last time,

13:46.330 --> 13:48.301
I thought you needed
extra training.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.867
Thankfully, just a coffee table

13:51.002 --> 13:52.167
was the only casualty this time.

13:52.302 --> 13:54.105
Oh! And you're a guest,
eh, Fred?

13:54.241 --> 13:57.438
What the bloody hell
is going on?

13:58.446 --> 13:59.740
Who is this?

14:00.443 --> 14:02.613
Siu-ling, this is
my old mate, Fred.

14:02.749 --> 14:04.643
Fred, meet Siu-ling.

14:05.245 --> 14:09.555
Oh, sorry.
I, I thought he brought you in
to even up the odds.

14:09.691 --> 14:10.885
Nice to meet you, Fred.

14:11.021 --> 14:12.792
I'm a bit confused here.

14:13.161 --> 14:15.760
Is she a mate
or is she trying to kill you?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.157
A little bit of both actually.

14:17.292 --> 14:19.427
Um, Siu-ling helps me decompress

14:19.562 --> 14:21.895
after a decent shift,
if you know what I mean.

14:22.264 --> 14:24.167
Fallon is a good martial artist.

14:24.302 --> 14:27.171
He trains with me
and I make him better.

14:28.873 --> 14:31.440
Look, uh,

14:31.575 --> 14:33.239
me and Fred have got a bit
of catching up to do,

14:33.374 --> 14:35.548
so, um, I'll tell you what,

14:35.684 --> 14:38.611
call that one a draw,
and I'll see when it's time
for the next ruck, yeah?

14:40.821 --> 14:42.384
Sorry about your face, Fred.

14:43.658 --> 14:44.551
Oh, that's all right.

14:45.494 --> 14:46.454
Nice to meet you.

14:47.692 --> 14:49.061
See you.

14:51.793 --> 14:54.761
Listen,
you can stay here tonight

14:54.896 --> 14:56.530
'cause the police are
probably scouring the streets

14:56.665 --> 14:58.198
looking for a little pudgy
specky tosser

14:58.334 --> 14:59.298
with the pocket flame thrower.

14:59.434 --> 15:01.003
But, after that, you're gone.

15:01.406 --> 15:03.870
There's no need
to be like that, Mike.

15:04.372 --> 15:06.873
I'm looking for Leylo, my lover.

15:07.242 --> 15:11.014
-And I could really do
with your help.
-She's a scam, mate, right?

15:11.150 --> 15:15.549
She's a scam which only lonely
bastards like you fall for.
How much did you pay her?

15:16.483 --> 15:18.350
Fifty grand, give or take.

15:18.486 --> 15:21.287
Fifty grand, you stupid twit!

15:21.422 --> 15:23.662
She needed it for the visas

15:23.797 --> 15:25.597
and the plane tickets.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.064
She got on a flight from Haiti,

15:28.199 --> 15:29.696
and she hasn't been seen since,

15:30.132 --> 15:33.806
until one
of my old stool pigeons
saw her in a club over here.

15:34.175 --> 15:36.708
Luckily, you were there
to help me out.

15:36.844 --> 15:41.013
Lucky, my asshole, mate.
I get the feeling that
this is a bad bleedin' omen.

15:41.549 --> 15:46.547
An omen is somewhere in between
opportunity and wisdom, Michael.

15:46.682 --> 15:48.419
Look, I ain't got time
for this, all right?

15:48.555 --> 15:50.954
I'm behind on a job, and I,
I need to get my head around it.

15:51.090 --> 15:52.551
Well, let me have a butchers.

15:52.687 --> 15:55.123
A problem shared
is a problem halved.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.492
I might be able to help you out.

16:20.285 --> 16:21.451
<i>Meet Mr. McEllif.</i>

16:22.054 --> 16:23.420
<i>A self-professed hermit.</i>

16:23.555 --> 16:25.290
<i>Never leaves the house,</i>
<i>nor day or night,</i>

16:25.426 --> 16:27.353
<i>but he does, however,</i>
<i>water his lovely flowers</i>

16:27.488 --> 16:29.254
<i>once a day at noon without fail.</i>

16:29.623 --> 16:32.593
<i>Didn't take Fred long</i>
<i>to tap into</i>
<i>his high-tech security system.</i>

16:32.728 --> 16:34.632
<i>-Let's see if this works.</i>

16:37.265 --> 16:38.199
<i>Bleedin' hell!</i>

16:38.668 --> 16:40.271
<i>That couldn't have gone</i>
<i>any better.</i>

16:47.979 --> 16:50.545
Did you see the way
his head bounced along,
along my balls?

16:50.681 --> 16:52.779
-Oh, mate, that was exquisite.

16:52.915 --> 16:55.752
Cheers! It's great
to be back in the saddle again.

16:55.887 --> 16:59.518
-Hmm.
-So, anything else in the
pipeline that you need me?

16:59.654 --> 17:00.821
-Well--
-Hang on a minute, Fred.

17:01.390 --> 17:02.789
I didn't say you could stay.

17:03.325 --> 17:04.823
But we make a good team.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.798
Well, I've been
pretty busy lately.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.500
You know what, it turns out
there's more people

17:11.635 --> 17:13.067
that need killing
in this corner of the world

17:13.203 --> 17:14.135
than I can keep up with.

17:14.270 --> 17:15.870
So I can stay then, Mike.

17:16.006 --> 17:18.509
<i>How could I mind?</i>
<i>I mean, look at him.</i>

17:18.645 --> 17:20.774
<i>I wouldn't trust most people</i>
<i>as far as I could frame,</i>

17:20.909 --> 17:23.149
<i>but Fred's as honest</i>
<i>as the day is long.</i>

17:23.284 --> 17:25.783
<i>Well, as honest</i>
<i>as any killer can be.</i>

17:26.552 --> 17:29.186
-All right.
You can stay, for a bit.
-Yes!

17:29.322 --> 17:30.853
And don't you
be telling Big Ray.

17:31.856 --> 17:33.424
-Of course not.
-'Cause you know
what's going to happen

17:33.559 --> 17:34.686
if he finds out
we're working together again.

17:34.822 --> 17:36.426
-He wouldn't be happy, would he?
-No.

17:37.695 --> 17:39.660
All right, cool.
It looks like you're gonna have

17:39.795 --> 17:41.629
to get your test pilot cap
on again, mate,

17:41.764 --> 17:44.436
because you're gonna need
to sing for your supper.

17:47.537 --> 17:50.110
-How about poison nuts?
-Mm.

17:50.878 --> 17:51.841
Here we go then, mate.

17:55.550 --> 17:56.679
Yes.

18:01.621 --> 18:04.089

18:51.999 --> 18:53.770

Come on. Just think
of that lovely, happy tingling.

19:02.650 --> 19:04.246
Oh, fuck!

19:04.715 --> 19:08.486
Please, no, Mike.
You cut up on a bit of fun.

19:08.621 --> 19:10.951
I thought I was gonna
actually have to chug him.

19:11.721 --> 19:13.325

<i>somewhere a bit more private,</i>
<i>we found a nice little pad,</i>

19:26.704 --> 19:29.203
<i>decided to drop</i>
<i>a few quid on an HQ.</i>

19:29.338 --> 19:31.310
<i>Well, kind of.</i>

19:32.845 --> 19:36.110
<i>This is the shambles,</i>
<i>as Fred started calling it</i>

19:36.246 --> 19:39.146

<i>if they're actually going</i>
<i>to work in the real world.</i>

19:50.898 --> 19:52.058
Come on, Fred.

19:53.428 --> 19:56.164
Oh, yes! Yes!

19:56.299 --> 19:58.001
Whoa, what a shot!

19:58.136 --> 19:59.165
Nice one, mate.

19:59.634 --> 20:01.103
-Ready?
-I'm ready.

20:01.238 --> 20:03.776
Three, two, one...

20:08.577 --> 20:10.747
Give yourself a bit-- Move back.

20:11.584 --> 20:13.085
-All right. Ready, then?
-Yeah.

20:13.220 --> 20:15.121
Three, two, one. Go.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.283
-Ooh! Oh!

20:17.786 --> 20:19.853
-Ooh.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.361
Oh, shit.

20:22.996 --> 20:23.963
Blow it out, Fred.

20:24.399 --> 20:26.297
Fred, the fire extinguisher's
back here.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.696
Fred, there's
a fire extinguisher.

20:27.831 --> 20:29.898
Just get out of the way!
Move out of the way!

20:30.034 --> 20:31.403
Whoa-ho!

20:35.643 --> 20:37.408
I told you there was
a fire extinguisher over there.

20:37.543 --> 20:39.175
You want to set
the whole place on fire?

20:39.310 --> 20:40.709
Her tits are hanging out.

20:41.144 --> 20:42.007
Oh, yeah.

20:42.944 --> 20:45.178
Yeah,
I think that's it.

20:45.313 --> 20:46.212
Yeah?

20:46.581 --> 20:48.653
Filming then, Fred? Yeah?

20:48.789 --> 20:51.890
Ready? This is how you separate
the men from the boys.

20:52.025 --> 20:53.154
Three, two, one

20:55.392 --> 20:56.490
Oh, fuck me.

20:56.625 --> 20:58.159
Now, why is it not working?

20:58.895 --> 21:00.799
The flame's on.
Why is it not working?

21:01.668 --> 21:03.561
Might be all right
on bonfire night,

21:04.031 --> 21:05.563
-but as an accident.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.171
Oh, shut up, Fred.

21:07.774 --> 21:09.769
Flipping hell. I'm gonna have
to find the receipt now.

21:10.239 --> 21:12.544
You could always use it
to strip paint.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.446
Fuck off!

21:14.881 --> 21:16.582
One, two,

21:17.118 --> 21:18.582
-three...

21:19.450 --> 21:21.013
I told you it wasn't gonna work.

21:30.461 --> 21:31.892
No pain, no gain, eh, mate.

21:33.133 --> 21:34.729
I don't understand it.

21:34.864 --> 21:36.832
I calibrated
that trigger perfectly.

21:36.967 --> 21:39.437
It's slapdash, Fred, right,
like, most of the things

21:39.572 --> 21:40.968
you come up with.
Some of them are good.

21:41.103 --> 21:43.508
Most of them, like this one
over here, they're shit.

21:43.943 --> 21:46.441
It's like those suits over
there. Be honest with me, Fred.

21:46.877 --> 21:49.046
You really think
that they're going to work?

21:49.181 --> 21:50.482
They will work.

21:50.884 --> 21:54.415
I've whittled the detonating
cable down to a fine thread,

21:54.551 --> 21:56.484
and put it into the seams.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.819
I put C4 flakes in the lining,

21:58.954 --> 22:01.257
a blasting cap
in one of the buttons,

22:01.693 --> 22:03.022
and a receiver
in the other button.

22:03.158 --> 22:04.828
-So you have to do
is dial it in...
-Fred.

22:04.963 --> 22:07.692
-...and boom.
-Fred, it's not
gonna work, okay?

22:07.828 --> 22:10.764
It's not going to get the yield.
It's gonna singe him
a little bit at best.

22:10.899 --> 22:12.004
-Come on. Please.

22:12.139 --> 22:13.873
Wait a minute.

22:14.242 --> 22:16.134
I think we got a job coming in.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.469
Oh, yeah?

22:17.871 --> 22:20.243
-Wha--

22:20.378 --> 22:22.613
Have a butchers.

22:25.416 --> 22:27.079
Reject that right now.

22:28.020 --> 22:28.847
Why?

22:29.249 --> 22:30.852
Never bite the hand
that feeds you, mate.

22:31.819 --> 22:33.593
And what hand might that be?

22:34.229 --> 22:35.291
You ever heard of the Zuuzer?

22:36.060 --> 22:38.226
-No.
-No? Well, you bloody well
should have done.

22:38.362 --> 22:39.428
Mean as fuck.

22:39.563 --> 22:41.397
Old Testament. Cosa Nostra.

22:41.533 --> 22:42.862
Headed up by some nutbag witch

22:42.998 --> 22:45.236
with a reputation
as severe as a hairline.

22:45.672 --> 22:47.000
Proper wrath
of Hades stuff that, mate.

22:47.135 --> 22:50.001
So a mix of Cosa Nostra
and ancient Greek.

22:50.403 --> 22:53.279
-Don't sound ideal to me.
-No, it ain't, but, uh,

22:53.714 --> 22:55.876
pays the bills, doesn't it?
See that lad there?

22:56.011 --> 22:58.682
That is Mrs. Zuuzer's
reprobate kid.

22:58.817 --> 23:01.685
Mm. Talk about making
a rod for your own back.

23:01.820 --> 23:03.786
I'll tell you what.
Whoever accepts that job

23:03.921 --> 23:05.721
has got brass balls
bigger than their brains.

23:05.856 --> 23:07.554
I'd be surprised
if anyone touches that.

23:07.957 --> 23:09.391
So you want me
to reject it then?

23:09.527 --> 23:11.959
Absolutely. Get rid of it.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.999
Flamingo. Flamingo.

23:21.101 --> 23:22.640
-Coffee, Fred?

23:23.241 --> 23:24.503
Oh, yes, please.

23:25.774 --> 23:27.308
Can I have one as well?

23:30.683 --> 23:33.783
Did that sort out
your postmurder tension?

23:36.289 --> 23:37.186
You know something?

23:37.622 --> 23:39.218
We'd get a lot more jobs done

23:39.353 --> 23:42.328
if you didn't have to have
a ruck after every shift.

23:42.730 --> 23:45.091
Can't you just crack one out
and be done with it?

23:45.227 --> 23:47.962
I tried that, though,
Fred, it doesn't work.

23:52.105 --> 23:53.638
I spit in yours.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.876
Ow.

24:01.576 --> 24:02.477
Thanks.

24:02.913 --> 24:05.880
Pretty girl.

24:06.015 --> 24:08.147
She's the love
of my life, Siu-ling.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.150
She's gone missing.

24:10.619 --> 24:11.990
Missing? Where?

24:13.688 --> 24:14.857
I wish I knew.

24:15.693 --> 24:17.026
Then she wouldn't be missing.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.229
I had a friend like her.
She went missing too.

24:22.798 --> 24:27.199
But she eventually turned up
working in some dirty sex club
against her will.

24:28.376 --> 24:29.800
That would never happen to me.

24:30.536 --> 24:33.338
A friend of mine thought
he saw her in a place like that.

24:34.341 --> 24:36.676
I know someone
who helps girls like that.

24:37.645 --> 24:40.685
-I will ask around
-Really, Siu-ling?
That would be brilliant.

24:41.452 --> 24:43.017
Her name is Leylo,

24:43.152 --> 24:46.350
-and she is--
-A bleedin' scam is what she is.

24:47.387 --> 24:49.595
-Oh, bollocks!

24:52.861 --> 24:54.534
I will help if I can, Fred.

24:55.169 --> 24:56.063
Thanks, Siu-ling.

25:05.043 --> 25:07.806
-Nice one.
-See you later,<i> pok kai,</i> guys.

25:15.623 --> 25:17.418
You let her beat you
up then, yeah?

25:17.554 --> 25:20.653
Nah, nah,
she's legit, mate, right?
Eyes in the back of her head.

25:20.788 --> 25:23.989
And she knows
about eight different forms
of animal kung fu.

25:24.124 --> 25:25.761
It's like having
a scrap in a zoo.

25:26.130 --> 25:28.865
You are allowed to forgive
yourself, you know that.

25:29.868 --> 25:32.100
-What?
-For what happened in London.

25:32.836 --> 25:34.772
You're carrying all that guilt.

25:35.442 --> 25:36.968
You wanna let go of it.

25:37.104 --> 25:38.809
Otherwise you'll drown in it.

25:43.912 --> 25:44.843
Uh, I'll tell you what.

25:45.513 --> 25:47.751
The only thing I'm guilty of
is being stupid enough

25:47.886 --> 25:49.482
to get back
into business with you.

25:49.618 --> 25:51.585
-If that rubber ducky here
doesn't pay off--
-It'll work.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.788
Yeah? Well, make sure it does,
'cause we're leaving
in an hour.

25:54.923 --> 25:56.926
It's all primed and ready to go.

25:57.427 --> 25:58.323
Good.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.832
Miserable bastard.

26:35.395 --> 26:37.562
-Hello.
-<i> Evening, sir.</i>

26:37.697 --> 26:41.234
<i>Sorry to bother you. I,</i>
<i>I was just wondering if you knew</i>

26:41.370 --> 26:44.205
<i>in which city</i>
<i>King Edgar of England</i>

26:44.340 --> 26:47.509
<i>-was crowned back in 973 A.D.</i>

27:02.663 --> 27:04.191
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

27:05.328 --> 27:08.133
Ow. What the...
the bloody hell's going on?

27:08.269 --> 27:09.130
Where are we?

27:12.835 --> 27:15.741
So you are the famed

27:16.310 --> 27:17.842
Accident Man?

27:19.773 --> 27:20.675
No, mate.

27:21.345 --> 27:23.815
I think you might have me
confused with somebody else.

27:24.917 --> 27:26.818
Where were you
last Thursday night?

27:27.718 --> 27:29.315
Last Thursday night...

27:30.755 --> 27:31.754
Oh, yeah, that's right.

27:32.356 --> 27:35.259
Watching your mom try not
to swallow a tongue, I think.

27:38.763 --> 27:40.124
You fucking mule!

27:40.660 --> 27:43.928
We made you and your
knickyknacky very wealthy.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.764
Show some respect.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.438
Knickyknacky?

27:50.044 --> 27:53.573
Jesus Christ, mate.
Is that all you've got?

27:53.708 --> 27:54.708
Okay.

28:03.519 --> 28:06.121
-This is fun to you, no?
-Yeah, it's pretty funny, mate,

28:06.256 --> 28:08.488
'cause you hit
like a bleedin' Teletubby.

28:09.358 --> 28:11.697
-There you go, mate. That's it.

28:11.833 --> 28:14.296
Get stuck in,
why don't you? Come on!

28:14.431 --> 28:17.264
Enough with this
toxic masculinity.

28:18.066 --> 28:19.905
We know exactly who you are,

28:20.040 --> 28:22.936
since one of my loyal soldiers
sacrificed himself

28:23.071 --> 28:25.406
so that we may draw you out.

28:25.908 --> 28:26.905
Hang on a minute.

28:27.508 --> 28:29.179
You let one of your
own team members die

28:29.314 --> 28:32.246
just to get a face-to-face
with me?

28:32.881 --> 28:33.848
I'm flattered.

28:33.984 --> 28:35.685
I have to hand it to you both.

28:35.820 --> 28:38.489
That bathtub ploy was ingenious.

28:38.624 --> 28:39.688
Oh, you liked that, yeah?

28:39.823 --> 28:40.951
Fred's idea that was.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.320
Quite innovative.

28:42.456 --> 28:45.292
Just another day
at the office, Mrs...

28:45.761 --> 28:47.196
Zuuzer.

28:47.665 --> 28:49.368
Oh, fuck. Mike?

28:49.871 --> 28:52.432
-Wrath of Hades.
-That's right, mate. Yeah.

28:53.335 --> 28:55.301
I take it
by your friend's palpitations

28:55.436 --> 28:57.639
that you are aware
of our reputation.

28:57.775 --> 28:59.003
We know who you are.

28:59.139 --> 29:00.405
Good for you.

29:00.540 --> 29:03.008
And how about
this little gentleman?

29:03.143 --> 29:04.942
Do you know who he is?

29:08.021 --> 29:10.148
Spoiled little runt
by the looks of it.

29:11.051 --> 29:14.019
Unfortunately,
you are not far from the truth.

29:14.154 --> 29:16.796
This is my son Dante.

29:17.663 --> 29:18.762
He was raised well,

29:18.897 --> 29:21.128
educated in the finest schools,

29:21.264 --> 29:23.395
tutored in the ways
of the world.

29:23.864 --> 29:27.467
But with all that behind him,
he still managed to spiral

29:27.602 --> 29:31.003
into this pathetic
drug-addled delinquent mess

29:31.139 --> 29:32.671
you see before you now.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.639
-I love you too, Mama.
-Quiet!

29:36.676 --> 29:40.314
So you two
have never seen him before?

29:40.914 --> 29:41.847
Never.

29:41.983 --> 29:44.116
Dante has decided

29:44.252 --> 29:46.353
to rinse his premium breeding,

29:46.488 --> 29:49.324
and doors I've opened
for him into the gutter,

29:49.459 --> 29:52.497
all in the name of following
some quixotic dream

29:52.633 --> 29:55.032
of becoming a pop star.

29:55.167 --> 29:57.530
Something he is adamant
he can achieve,

29:57.665 --> 30:00.735
even though he has
the voice of a snared animal.

30:00.871 --> 30:04.008
Mama, how dare you?

30:04.144 --> 30:06.708
Quiet! Or I'll have you
gagged and whipped.

30:06.843 --> 30:09.140
<i>♪ But don't pay</i>
<i>'cause it might ♪</i>

30:09.275 --> 30:12.347
<i>Every night he defies me,</i>
<i>getting paralytic,</i>

30:12.482 --> 30:15.752
<i>snorting cocaine</i>
<i>out of whores' backsides,</i>

30:15.887 --> 30:17.885
<i>and raping everyone's ear drums.</i>

30:19.688 --> 30:23.923
To salt the wounds of all
of his filthy dispositions,

30:24.058 --> 30:26.226
Dante also smokes.

30:27.062 --> 30:32.169
It was that vulgar addiction,
which last week
proved problematic.

30:32.304 --> 30:35.767
<i>Dante's team escorts him</i>
<i>outside the karaoke bar</i>

30:35.902 --> 30:40.408
<i>every 12 minutes,</i>
<i>so he may poison his lungs</i>

30:40.543 --> 30:43.610
<i>along with the rest</i>
<i>of his eroding innards.</i>

30:43.746 --> 30:46.983
I told you smoking would be
the death of you, didn't I?

30:47.119 --> 30:49.251
Yeah, well,
before you said it was

30:49.386 --> 30:51.924
when I kept kissing
the cat on the mouth.

30:55.693 --> 30:56.654
This...

30:59.127 --> 31:00.933
...was no accident.

31:02.135 --> 31:04.530
Although it was played out
to look like one.

31:05.773 --> 31:08.471
Something of your speciality.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.974
Our people look into it.

31:11.443 --> 31:15.981
They tell us the gas pipe
was tampered with in that sewer.

31:16.417 --> 31:17.316
Wasn't me.

31:17.685 --> 31:19.345
That job did come in, but,

31:19.481 --> 31:21.312
-but we rejected it.
-Yeah, we did.

31:21.448 --> 31:23.516
Was it last Thursday, you say?

31:24.887 --> 31:26.089
We got an alibi.

31:26.224 --> 31:28.026
That was your birthday,
wasn't it, mate?

31:28.161 --> 31:29.887
-Twenty-one again.
-That's right.

31:30.023 --> 31:32.261
Actually, I think we were in
one of your clubs, to be honest.

31:32.397 --> 31:34.663
Your security cameras
can probably clear us.

31:34.799 --> 31:36.033
Coincidence, huh?

31:36.169 --> 31:37.596
What's the name
of that club again, Fred?

31:38.672 --> 31:40.267
The Sparkling Clap.

31:40.402 --> 31:42.269
Sparkling Clown.
That was it. Yeah.

31:42.405 --> 31:44.707
Even sounds like
a bloody yeast infection.

31:44.843 --> 31:47.505
You know the one,
the one with the big heifer
singing on the stage.

31:47.641 --> 31:50.312
-Your missus, I'm guessing

31:51.079 --> 31:52.347
-Ow.

31:54.021 --> 31:56.350
-You all right, mate?

31:56.485 --> 31:58.451
Hurt yourself, did you?
Bloody hell.

31:58.586 --> 32:01.123
You really are
all flash and no bash.

32:01.259 --> 32:04.528
So I guess that puts you
in the clear.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.991
-I think so, yeah.
-For now.

32:08.327 --> 32:13.234
It would seem
that a spineless corporate CEO
out of Scandinavia

32:13.370 --> 32:15.701
has put out
a contract on my son.

32:15.837 --> 32:18.736
We never thought anyone
would be stupid enough to.

32:18.871 --> 32:22.241
And since you are
a very capable contractor,

32:22.376 --> 32:26.579
only someone like you would have
the skills to find out
who this assassin is.

32:26.715 --> 32:29.985
I need you to hunt down
whoever that may be,

32:30.120 --> 32:31.655
and I want you to kill them.

32:32.391 --> 32:35.225
I'd rather lick
a crackhead's scabby elbow.

32:35.361 --> 32:38.388
Very well. If you do not,
we will kill your friend.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.192
-What?

32:40.728 --> 32:42.428
Go on, kill him then.
I don't give a shit.

32:42.564 --> 32:44.832
Don't test my resolve,
Mr. Fallon.

32:44.967 --> 32:46.665
-Oh, please crack on.
I couldn't care less.
-Ah.

32:46.801 --> 32:48.469
This joke's been doing
my head in for years.

32:48.604 --> 32:50.300
You know what?
You'd be doing me a favor.

32:50.436 --> 32:51.608
Go on, mate, do him.

32:51.744 --> 32:53.204
Mike! No. Why?

32:53.339 --> 32:55.539
Armando, on<i> tre.</i>

32:55.675 --> 32:57.980
<i>-Uno.</i>

32:58.116 --> 33:00.079
<i>-Due.</i>

33:00.214 --> 33:04.089
<i>-Tre.</i>
-All right, fine, fine.
I'll do it for triple the faith.

33:04.224 --> 33:06.723
You'll do it for his life.
This is simple.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.587
Intercept and kill
whoever is trying
to take my<i> figlio</i> from me,

33:09.723 --> 33:11.624
and you can have
your concubine back.

33:14.495 --> 33:15.793
What the fuck does that mean?

33:23.469 --> 33:24.906
Yeah. Cheers, lads.

33:25.376 --> 33:26.845
<i>Much as I'd like</i>
<i>to cut my losses</i>

33:26.980 --> 33:27.978
<i>and get the hell out of here,</i>

33:28.113 --> 33:29.244
<i>I couldn't do that to Fred.</i>

33:29.880 --> 33:32.548
<i>And, you know, what makes this</i>
<i>whole situation even more weird</i>

33:32.683 --> 33:35.283
<i>is that botched hit</i>
<i>did have me written all over it.</i>

33:35.853 --> 33:39.124
<i>What the bleeding hell</i>
<i>am I gonna do? I need a pint.</i>

33:54.941 --> 33:56.174
How'd you find me, Ray?

34:13.286 --> 34:16.293
-Listen, Ray--
-You know what really
twist my knickers?

34:18.159 --> 34:21.665
You put your faith in a foreign
boozer, just like this one...

34:22.602 --> 34:26.238
...who claim to serve a classic
full English breakfast...

34:27.408 --> 34:29.834
...and they end up serving you
pig swill like this.

34:32.273 --> 34:33.376
Take this bugger.

34:33.976 --> 34:34.872
Yeah?

34:35.948 --> 34:37.011
Looks decent enough.

34:37.947 --> 34:42.352
And you trust that it's
gonna be wholesome, nutritious,

34:42.987 --> 34:44.015
tasty as fuck.

34:45.051 --> 34:47.287
But then you dig a little deeper
beneath the surface

34:47.422 --> 34:49.161
and actually take a bite...

34:51.964 --> 34:53.158
...and you realize...

34:54.061 --> 34:58.863
...it's a treacherous,
classless, fucking let down...

35:00.708 --> 35:02.735
...just like you.

35:05.112 --> 35:07.275
But I'm ravenous,
so<i> c'est la vie.</i>

35:08.045 --> 35:11.876
I heard that you've got
a nice little earner guy
around down here.

35:13.217 --> 35:14.311
I don't know what you mean, Ray.

35:24.397 --> 35:26.123
<i>Dear, Ray, I hope you're well.</i>

35:26.259 --> 35:29.234
<i>I just wanted you to know</i>
<i>that I'm doing okay.</i>

35:29.369 --> 35:31.795
<i>So no need to worry,</i>
<i>me and Mike.</i>

35:31.931 --> 35:34.271
-For fuck's sake.
-And to be fair to Fred,

35:34.407 --> 35:36.841
he didn't actually say
where here was.

35:37.477 --> 35:40.143
But that numpty
jots his note down on a napkin

35:40.278 --> 35:41.773
from the Black Bull bar,
Valletta.

35:42.176 --> 35:45.042
Oh, it's just a side thing
we got going on down there.

35:45.178 --> 35:47.879
It's not like we're breaking
the bank or anything.

35:48.014 --> 35:50.421
<i>P.S. We are breaking the bank!</i>

35:52.724 --> 35:55.489
Well, you know what Fred's like,
right? He exaggerates.

35:55.625 --> 35:57.194
Nothing we've got
going on down here

35:57.330 --> 35:59.429
-is going to bother you--
-Bother me?

36:00.329 --> 36:01.529
You having a laugh?

36:01.664 --> 36:03.895
You have bothered me.
No, scratch that.

36:04.531 --> 36:06.165
You fucking ruined me.

36:07.101 --> 36:09.641
Do you think anyone would
hire us after what you did?

36:09.776 --> 36:13.641
No need to answer that
'cause the answer
is a fucking obvious no!

36:15.041 --> 36:17.912
You left me
with five fifths of fuck all.

36:18.548 --> 36:20.013
And to think...

36:21.083 --> 36:24.047
...that you had the stones
to start contracting again.

36:25.184 --> 36:28.557
You destroyed
what took me decades to build.

36:29.829 --> 36:30.724
For that...

36:31.965 --> 36:32.891
...you're gonna pay.

36:35.428 --> 36:37.797
-Well, I'll pay for your
full English, then, shall I?

36:41.308 --> 36:42.902
You're gonna pay
for more than that.

36:43.772 --> 36:45.644
You brought me
out of retirement.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.543
I'm actually down here
for a gig.

36:47.678 --> 36:49.279
And the fact that here
happens to be Malta

36:49.415 --> 36:51.010
and I can "catch up"
with me mates...

36:51.813 --> 36:53.483
...it's actually a little
brucie bonus.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.014
It was you, wasn't it?

36:56.717 --> 36:58.887
Eh, that botch Zuuzer kid job?

36:59.423 --> 37:01.789
That was you, right?

37:02.425 --> 37:03.755
Not like you to miss, Ray.

37:03.891 --> 37:06.325
Yeah, well,
like I said, a bit rusty.

37:06.961 --> 37:09.268
Made mistakes
like I did back in London.

37:10.104 --> 37:11.732
Should've just shot the cunt.

37:12.201 --> 37:13.336
Old school.

37:13.872 --> 37:17.171
Listen, Ray, you need to bail on
this Zuuzer kid job, right?

37:17.306 --> 37:19.672
They thought it was me
that tampered with that gas line
'cause you tried

37:19.807 --> 37:21.179
to make it look
like an accident.

37:21.315 --> 37:23.076
Now they've got Fred
held hostage.

37:23.211 --> 37:26.048
Anything happens to that kid,
they're going to kill Fred.

37:26.484 --> 37:28.016
Well, that's not
my problem, is it?

37:28.485 --> 37:30.016
He's your mate now, not mine.

37:30.151 --> 37:31.951
-Come on--
-You both made that
abundantly clear.

37:32.087 --> 37:33.688
I don't know why you took
the job in the first place.

37:33.823 --> 37:35.392
Anyway, if you've done
your due diligence,

37:35.528 --> 37:36.822
you would've known
why we passed on it.

37:36.957 --> 37:39.194
Why everybody fucking
passed on it.

37:39.863 --> 37:42.432
He's the heir to the Zuuzer
family, for God's sakes.

37:42.567 --> 37:44.430
Well, a mark's a mark,
a job's a job.

37:44.566 --> 37:47.306
And I ain't scared
of any crime family
from the arse end of nowhere.

37:47.441 --> 37:49.704
-You should be.
-Well, I fucking ain't.

37:52.980 --> 37:53.877
There was a time...

37:54.646 --> 37:56.441
...when we didn't give two shits
who the mark was?

37:56.577 --> 37:58.812
-Well, that was before
your little hissy fit.
-The only thing you need

37:58.947 --> 38:01.216
to give a shit about
right now is Mrs. Zuuzer,

38:01.351 --> 38:04.554
'cause she will
slit Fred's throat
if you don't call off this hit.

38:08.722 --> 38:09.687
You haven't heard, have you?

38:10.457 --> 38:13.992
-Heard what?
-Well, the client
has upped the bounty by...

38:15.430 --> 38:16.561
...fucking loads.

38:17.264 --> 38:20.001
I ain't the sole contractor
anymore.

38:20.737 --> 38:22.204
What are you talking about?
To who?

38:22.340 --> 38:24.140
Everyone worth their salt.

38:24.742 --> 38:26.640
Criminal crop just
landed on Maltese soil.

38:27.243 --> 38:29.306
-You're fucking joking.
-Called us all in
for a briefing.

38:29.708 --> 38:33.385
I can't remember a client
ever being arrogant enough
to do that.

38:34.186 --> 38:35.448
But I guess money talks.

38:36.017 --> 38:38.248
Pays 50 grand
just to turn up in person.

38:38.851 --> 38:40.954
<i>One by one, uh, step up,</i>

38:41.089 --> 38:43.626
<i>load our bank details</i>
<i>into the computer.</i>

38:45.091 --> 38:48.464
It's a massive
nine million euros

38:48.600 --> 38:49.995
to the lucky sod
who gets the job done.

38:50.130 --> 38:55.340
That's 7,675,056 pounds sterling
in real money.

38:55.476 --> 38:57.376
We're talking about
who would you say?

38:58.178 --> 38:59.675
Oyumi wasn't there, was he?

39:02.411 --> 39:03.547
Oh, he was there.

39:04.213 --> 39:05.282
Yeah.

39:05.651 --> 39:08.519
So, no need to kill personally
on this one, eh,

39:08.654 --> 39:11.149
'cause Oyumi
is a bona fide fucking ninja.

39:11.284 --> 39:13.887
If he's seen your name,
you won't see him coming.

39:15.262 --> 39:18.128
So... looks like Fred's fucked,

39:18.263 --> 39:20.696
because if I don't do it,
you can rest assured
one of the others will.

39:20.832 --> 39:23.334
Ray, please, you need
to help me with this one.

39:23.470 --> 39:25.230
I ain't helping you
with fuck all.

39:25.699 --> 39:27.300
So stay out of my way.

39:28.002 --> 39:30.269
And when I've snuffed out
this little runt,

39:31.005 --> 39:32.603
we'll get back
to what you owe me.

39:33.739 --> 39:36.881
-Whatever we've got
going on can wait because--

39:37.016 --> 39:37.607
What's that?

39:42.421 --> 39:44.787
It turns out that little twerp

39:44.922 --> 39:47.155
has already got a fucking
tracking device on him.

39:47.791 --> 39:49.923
Client's sending over
the link now.

39:51.090 --> 39:53.630
So you better get
your skates on.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.428

What are you doing here?

40:52.057 --> 40:54.922
Easy, lads. I come in peace.
We're all on the same team.

40:55.057 --> 40:56.725
But you need to get him
out of here quick.

40:56.861 --> 40:59.023
We don't need your help,
you English prick.

40:59.159 --> 41:02.299
Yeah, you do actually, mate,
'cause this tone-deaf joke's
got a tracking device on him.

41:02.434 --> 41:05.902
There's a gaggle of assassins
about to turn up,
kill every last one of you.

41:06.037 --> 41:08.838
Of course he has, you<i> idiota.</i>
It's in his watch.

41:08.973 --> 41:11.376
How else do you think
we keep track of him, huh?

41:11.512 --> 41:13.070
He had it
since he was a<i> bambino.</i>

41:13.206 --> 41:14.676
Look, it's
a burning fuse now, mate.

41:14.812 --> 41:16.175
You need to get rid of it.
Ditch it.

41:16.310 --> 41:19.177
-Oh!

41:19.313 --> 41:22.814
Who the fuck do you think
you are, eh, dickhead?

41:22.950 --> 41:24.721
You're the fucking hired help.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.656
This watch, eh,
is a classic, one of a kind.

41:27.792 --> 41:30.426
I would die
before I take it off.

41:30.561 --> 41:32.828
So... you fucking arsehole.

41:33.264 --> 41:35.558
-Take the watch and destroy it.
-What the fuck did I just--

41:35.694 --> 41:37.961
-Good call.
-Who the fuck
do you all think you are?

41:38.096 --> 41:40.638
Last shot. I mean, you fucking--

41:49.842 --> 41:51.748
Aah!

41:52.978 --> 41:55.015
Oh! Problem is solved.

42:29.088 --> 42:32.152
<i>Freya Du Preeze,</i>
<i>the Angel of Death.</i>

42:32.287 --> 42:34.524
<i>Recruited in Johannesburg</i>
<i>by Interpol,</i>

42:34.659 --> 42:38.755
<i>and trained in the dark arts</i>
<i>by those who think</i>
<i>James Bond is a Muppet.</i>

42:51.609 --> 42:53.210
-Freeze.

43:17.162 --> 43:20.203
You got to stop it--

43:39.084 --> 43:41.222
-Freya.
-Fallon.

43:42.225 --> 43:44.729
-Been a while.
-More like five years I reckon.

43:45.463 --> 43:46.729
Russia, wasn't it?

43:47.331 --> 43:51.032
You stole
that dirty politician from here.

43:51.668 --> 43:52.870
I know what it's like.

43:53.439 --> 43:54.503
First come, first served.

43:54.939 --> 43:57.100
Hmm. I've always
respected you, Fallon.

43:57.235 --> 43:58.606
You're a damn good assassin.

43:59.242 --> 44:02.342
But... there was a choice
between killing you...

44:02.978 --> 44:04.315
...or nine million in my bank.

44:05.051 --> 44:08.251
I'm afraid
that's no choice at all.

44:08.854 --> 44:10.515
This one's personal
to me, Freya.

44:11.085 --> 44:13.685
So as a professional courtesy,

44:14.288 --> 44:16.288
I'll need to ask you
to fuck off.

44:17.330 --> 44:18.357
I can't fuck off.

44:19.026 --> 44:21.366
But I can fuck you up.

44:58.271 --> 44:59.635
Okay, Freya.

44:59.771 --> 45:01.031
Really nice seeing you again.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.368
Maybe you should call it a day,
don't you?

45:11.184 --> 45:12.050
I see.

46:52.848 --> 46:54.048
Jesus Christ!

46:54.184 --> 46:56.482
Well, move
your fucking head then.

47:16.402 --> 47:18.939
No, please! Please.

47:19.074 --> 47:22.441
Please. Please!

47:28.486 --> 47:29.580
Oh, fuck.

47:38.331 --> 47:39.660
Oh, fuck!

47:41.293 --> 47:43.060
What the fuck, what--

47:43.195 --> 47:45.033
Oh, God.

47:45.169 --> 47:47.837
-What the fuck is going on?

47:47.972 --> 47:49.204
-Come here.

47:52.177 --> 47:54.175
<i>Mr. Fallon, do you have my son?</i>

47:54.544 --> 47:56.541
I've got him here. Pretty proper
kicked off back there,

47:56.676 --> 47:59.010
and your entire security team
got wasted.

47:59.513 --> 48:01.551
-Is he okay?
-Oh, he's fine. Yeah.

48:01.686 --> 48:04.016
Apart from the fact
he just decided to swallow
his own watch.

48:04.152 --> 48:07.187
So unless I cut it
out of his guts, he's going
to be a walking target

48:07.323 --> 48:08.892
till he pinches off
his next loaf.

48:09.028 --> 48:10.354
When was the last time
you took a shit?

48:10.489 --> 48:12.555
None of your business,<i> cafone.</i>

48:12.691 --> 48:14.498
Is that my mama?
I want to talk to her.

48:14.633 --> 48:15.358
Mama--

48:16.094 --> 48:19.829
I need you to protect my son
at all costs. Do you understand?

48:19.965 --> 48:21.968
Listen, right, I ain't
a fucking babysitter, okay?

48:22.104 --> 48:23.500
I'm a professional killer.

48:23.636 --> 48:25.441
And with all due respect,
Mrs. Zuuzer,

48:25.577 --> 48:28.773
your son is an absolute squats.
Me and him ain't gonna jell.

48:28.908 --> 48:31.946
Mama, this asshole just
punched me in the face.

48:32.081 --> 48:33.680
You don't need to get along.

48:33.816 --> 48:37.582
You just need to neutralize
the threats and keep him alive.

48:37.718 --> 48:39.983
You're lucky
I don't kill this prick myself.

48:40.419 --> 48:43.720
If you ever want to see
your friend again,
you won't make that mistake.

48:45.361 --> 48:47.895
Bring him back to me
in one piece.

48:48.331 --> 48:51.398
Do we have a deal,
Mr. Accident Man?

48:52.703 --> 48:53.636
All right, fine.

48:53.771 --> 48:55.270
Then it's done.

48:58.374 --> 49:00.444
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

49:00.580 --> 49:03.008
Take me to my mama.
She's the only one
who can protect me.

49:03.143 --> 49:06.445
Listen to me, you idiot.
Your mummy just hired me
to protect you, okay?

49:06.580 --> 49:08.318
-So do as you're fucking told.

49:08.453 --> 49:11.985
You're, you're, you, you,
you are a fucking ugly troll.

49:12.355 --> 49:13.616
Anybody ever
tell you that, yeah?

49:13.752 --> 49:16.389
You like a fucking melted
Ben Affleck.

49:16.524 --> 49:18.258
I'm going to tell my mama
how you treat me.

49:18.394 --> 49:19.690
You're going to pay
for your actions.

49:19.825 --> 49:22.900
She knows exactly
how to treat a man like you.

49:23.036 --> 49:25.533
-And if you strike me one more--

49:25.902 --> 49:27.001
Jesus.

49:27.136 --> 49:28.599
What the fuck are you doing here

49:28.734 --> 49:30.203
around the county
to buy a fucking shampoo?

49:30.338 --> 49:32.040
-Shut up!

49:32.175 --> 49:34.077
-Laxatives. You got any?
-Yeah.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.739
-Well, give it to me.
Come on, let's go.
-Here.

49:37.175 --> 49:39.611
-What the fuck
are you doing, you--
-Shut up!

49:40.783 --> 49:41.712
Ugh.

49:44.053 --> 49:45.752
You-- What the fuck you--

49:50.692 --> 49:52.592
In one end, out the other,
eh, mate?

49:53.195 --> 49:55.726
Just take me home, boy.

49:56.595 --> 49:59.868
You call me boy one more time,
I swear to God, I'm gonna
kill you myself, right?

50:00.004 --> 50:02.599
And I'll worry about killing
your old git of a mother
when the time comes.

50:02.735 --> 50:05.104
-You understand?
-Take me to my mama!

50:05.240 --> 50:08.244
Take me to my mama! Take--

50:19.690 --> 50:21.992
-You got a backway
out of this place?
-Yeah. There.

50:22.128 --> 50:23.623
-Come here. Let's go.

50:23.758 --> 50:25.625
-Keep moving!
-Where's my mother?

50:25.761 --> 50:28.362
Please, just give me
five minutes. I can't breathe.

50:28.498 --> 50:31.466
I've got asthma
probably. Please.

50:31.602 --> 50:34.032
-Hello, are you listening to me?
-Oh, shut up! Shut up!

50:47.583 --> 50:49.747
<i>Now, this is the great Yendi.</i>

50:50.282 --> 50:53.817
<i>Born in Ghana, named after</i>
<i>the town he was abandoned in.</i>

50:53.952 --> 50:55.985
<i>He sells himself</i>
<i>as a soddin' vampire,</i>

50:56.120 --> 50:59.295
<i>but essentially</i>
<i>he's just a fucking butcher.</i>

51:00.899 --> 51:03.695
This is Freya's blood!

51:04.230 --> 51:05.334
Most of it.

51:06.331 --> 51:07.837
B positive.

51:07.972 --> 51:09.199
Always try to be, pal.

51:09.334 --> 51:10.604
Foolish boy,

51:11.140 --> 51:12.875
B-positive is rare.

51:13.477 --> 51:17.143
Only about eight percent,
but not the rarest.

51:17.278 --> 51:18.578
What type are you, Rocky?

51:18.713 --> 51:21.218
Last time I checked,
high bloody octane, mate.

51:21.354 --> 51:23.513
Please, kill him
and my mama will make you rich.

51:23.648 --> 51:25.515
It does not work like that.

51:25.650 --> 51:29.589
It works the way I say it works.

51:33.032 --> 51:34.461
-Ow!
-Stay there.

51:34.596 --> 51:36.665
I'm looking forward
to killing him.

51:37.601 --> 51:40.197
But I will savor that one
till I'm done with you.

51:48.641 --> 51:51.644
-Get up.
-Fuckin--

51:55.549 --> 51:56.847
This way. Here.

52:10.868 --> 52:12.032
Fuck this!

52:29.188 --> 52:30.518
Up there. Get up there.

52:31.521 --> 52:33.417
-Get up there.
-Push me. Fuck it.

52:33.553 --> 52:35.758
Let's do that. Push me.

52:35.893 --> 52:39.058
-Fucking get up,
you dum-dum.
-I'm fucking trying.

52:41.297 --> 52:43.867
-Push!

52:44.503 --> 52:46.530
-Use your arms, get up.
-I'm using my arms.

52:46.665 --> 52:48.265
Do you think I'm using my teeth?

52:51.242 --> 52:54.344
I'm going to taste your blood.

53:08.225 --> 53:10.828
Help! Help!

53:10.964 --> 53:12.791
Dum-dum, where are you?

53:15.733 --> 53:19.937
There's a fucking maniac
with an ax trying to kill me.

53:20.073 --> 53:21.303
-Somebody get--
-Hey! Oi!

53:21.439 --> 53:22.740
-Come here.

53:24.405 --> 53:25.838
All right, get in there.

53:25.974 --> 53:28.139
And you stay in there
if you know what's good for you.

53:28.274 --> 53:30.479
-Look, I'm scared of this--
-It's okay.

55:18.685 --> 55:20.017
Let me know how this tastes.

55:35.372 --> 55:37.805
-Nice and tasty?

55:38.241 --> 55:39.971
AB negative...

55:41.712 --> 55:44.646
...the rarest
and finest of them all.

55:45.445 --> 55:46.780
What, me or you?

55:47.612 --> 55:50.388
I am unique.

55:51.090 --> 55:52.852
at less than one percent.

55:53.752 --> 55:56.589
You are common dirty boy.

55:56.724 --> 55:58.355
-Huh.

55:58.857 --> 56:00.092
Shall I finish you off then?

56:00.228 --> 56:01.498
No.

56:07.269 --> 56:08.165
Go on, then.

56:08.601 --> 56:09.869
Off your pop.

56:18.281 --> 56:20.143
Oh. Is he dead?

56:25.123 --> 56:27.491
He is now.

56:28.092 --> 56:29.225
So what now, eh?

56:29.694 --> 56:31.690
Eh, so what are
we doing now,<i> idiota?</i>

56:32.092 --> 56:33.960
<i>Idiota.</i> I guess that
that means idiot.

56:34.095 --> 56:36.361
Why don't we put that
on the same list as "boy"?

56:36.797 --> 56:38.365
I'm handling things. Come here.

56:39.368 --> 56:42.765
Siu-ling,
when you get this message,
I need you to do me a favor.

56:42.901 --> 56:46.371
There's a karaoke bar
off Strait Street.
I need you to pick up my bike.

56:48.739 --> 56:51.041
This whole place was drilled
into the side of a cliff,

56:51.176 --> 56:53.209
so these walls
are as thick as my skull.

56:53.578 --> 56:55.782
I think it's gonna buy some time
till we figure out what to do

56:55.918 --> 56:57.780
with that homing beacon
you swallowed.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.021
I see.

56:59.790 --> 57:01.558
I like what you've done
with the place.

57:06.362 --> 57:07.696
You sit there.

57:12.102 --> 57:13.231
Right.

57:13.867 --> 57:16.099
That is for puke, piss, shit,

57:16.234 --> 57:18.208
whatever else you feel
like pushing out.

57:18.677 --> 57:21.577
Are you insane?
I'm not going in a bucket.

57:21.713 --> 57:23.207
-I have rights.
-You lost your rights

57:23.343 --> 57:26.512
when you decided to swallow
that classic, you dimwit.

57:27.048 --> 57:28.885
And if you think
I'm letting you out of my sight,

57:29.254 --> 57:30.521
you need to think again.

57:32.224 --> 57:35.018
So anyway...

57:35.621 --> 57:38.358
...I know your mom might think
it's irrelevant to us, laymen,

57:38.494 --> 57:42.299
but you mind
explaining to me why five
of the world's best assassins

57:42.434 --> 57:44.165
are all lining up
to take you out?

57:45.168 --> 57:48.001
She must have pissed off some
people in some very high places.

57:48.136 --> 57:50.573
Do you think of my mama
ever tell me anything?

57:50.708 --> 57:54.105
She's a tyrant
with thugs and gangsters.

57:54.240 --> 57:55.975
So imagine what it's like
growing up with her.

57:56.111 --> 57:59.008
It's like being raised
by a fucking scorpion.

57:59.143 --> 58:00.481
Well, you think you had it bad?

58:00.883 --> 58:02.379
You haven't got
a clue, mate, right?

58:02.515 --> 58:05.217
Imagine if the bloody Terminator
was your surrogate father.

58:06.053 --> 58:07.724
You don't know
who you're talking about.

58:07.860 --> 58:10.687
All I know is, nobody
who ever crosses my mother,

58:10.822 --> 58:12.492
crosses her twice.

58:12.627 --> 58:14.894
My mother is so mean,

58:15.029 --> 58:18.294
even the Devil
would send her soul back.

58:18.430 --> 58:21.132
-My mother--
-My mother-- Shut up!

58:21.268 --> 58:24.542
Jesus Christ, I wish
I hadn't flaming asked.

58:25.839 --> 58:28.271
Can I-- Can I have water please?

58:29.311 --> 58:30.207
No.

58:32.282 --> 58:34.215
Please.

58:35.585 --> 58:37.716
Oh, I'm not safe with you.

58:37.852 --> 58:40.389
You are a magnet for psychos.

58:40.525 --> 58:42.723
Oh, I'm a magnet? No, no, no.

58:42.858 --> 58:44.353
I'm not the one
with a GPS signal

58:44.488 --> 58:46.557
wafting out of my arsehole,
mate, that's you.

58:48.630 --> 58:51.669
You better hope
that they don't get to me.
Otherwise, your friend...

58:51.804 --> 58:53.737
...he's going bye-bye.

58:53.873 --> 58:56.139
Look, it's gonna be
a very long day, okay?

58:56.275 --> 58:58.639
And I don't particularly
want to have to listen
to you blathering on.

58:59.209 --> 59:01.843
You know what? I hear that
your digestive system works

59:01.978 --> 59:04.212
three times as fast
once you're asleep. So...

59:04.681 --> 59:05.914
Maybe you should get some kip.

59:06.583 --> 59:08.283
It's the middle of the day.

59:08.418 --> 59:10.115
I'm not tired yet.

59:10.484 --> 59:11.418
Oh, okay.

59:30.771 --> 59:32.335
Stunning, isn't it?

59:34.179 --> 59:35.140
It's lovely.

59:37.215 --> 59:38.275
Fantastic...

59:40.747 --> 59:41.982
...color palette.

59:43.189 --> 59:44.622
Saint Anthony.

59:45.555 --> 59:47.990
Performer of Miracles.

59:48.359 --> 59:49.891
Ah. Oh, right.

59:51.092 --> 59:53.424
It is believed
that back in the day

59:53.559 --> 59:56.765
when Saint Anthony was walking
the streets of Padua,

59:56.900 --> 1:00:00.497
he saw a man
fall from a tall tower.

1:00:01.267 --> 1:00:03.740
Saint Anthony
commanded him to stop...

1:00:04.976 --> 1:00:08.338
...and the man remained
suspended in the air.

1:00:09.073 --> 1:00:11.209
His life was saved.

1:00:12.043 --> 1:00:14.113
That's very interesting.

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:17.714
The reason I'm telling you this

1:00:17.849 --> 1:00:20.051
is that if today

1:00:20.187 --> 1:00:24.327
an annoying,
bespectacled little man,

1:00:24.763 --> 1:00:27.291
were to fall
from a great height,

1:00:27.426 --> 1:00:30.531
I don't know
if Saint Anthony would be around

1:00:30.667 --> 1:00:32.835
to perform such a miracle.

1:00:34.740 --> 1:00:37.906
I don't know
quite what you mean.

1:00:42.512 --> 1:00:46.311
What she means,
little man, is that
we've lost Dante's signal.

1:00:47.214 --> 1:00:50.212
This isn't
very good news for you.

1:00:50.348 --> 1:00:52.552
Mike'll get the job done.

1:00:53.154 --> 1:00:55.587
You don't know him like I do.

1:01:01.900 --> 1:01:04.399
Your faith
in your partner is admirable.

1:01:04.535 --> 1:01:06.368
I can respect that.

1:01:07.337 --> 1:01:11.742
-But if your man does not
bring back my boy to me--
-He will.

1:01:12.210 --> 1:01:13.106
He will.

1:01:15.343 --> 1:01:19.244
You better pray that he does,
my little friend.

1:01:30.228 --> 1:01:32.490
<i>This place ain't watertight.</i>
<i>And if this pillar</i>

1:01:32.626 --> 1:01:34.793
<i>can't drop the kids off</i>
<i>to the pool anytime soon,</i>

1:01:34.929 --> 1:01:36.195
<i>we could get overrun.</i>

1:01:37.028 --> 1:01:38.334
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

1:01:39.270 --> 1:01:41.805
<i>Looks like we have</i>
<i>our first guest to the party.</i>

1:01:50.877 --> 1:01:53.743
Thought you said
it was a Flamingo situation
and then you grabbed me.

1:01:53.878 --> 1:01:57.451
-What the hell!
-I thought we said,
no nut shots.

1:01:57.587 --> 1:02:00.485
-And I told you
to protect them at all times.

1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:02.926
-I found your bike
by the karaoke club.
-Oof.

1:02:03.061 --> 1:02:05.592
Dude, did you get hit by a bum?
Was that you?

1:02:08.996 --> 1:02:10.966
Hey, hey, where you going?

1:02:13.670 --> 1:02:14.968
What is this place?

1:02:15.437 --> 1:02:17.402
Just somewhere me and Fred
get a bit of work done.

1:02:17.538 --> 1:02:20.041
-Don't worry about it.
-You mean where you kill people?

1:02:20.906 --> 1:02:22.043
I'm sorry, what?

1:02:23.209 --> 1:02:25.047
You think I am stupid like you?

1:02:25.583 --> 1:02:26.883
I know what you do.

1:02:27.518 --> 1:02:29.380
-Really?
-Yes.

1:02:30.487 --> 1:02:31.313
All right.

1:02:31.448 --> 1:02:33.550
-That doesn't bother you?

1:02:33.686 --> 1:02:36.591
No. I figured you only
kill people who deserve it.

1:02:37.327 --> 1:02:40.391
Oh, yeah, yeah. They, uh,
they definitely all deserved it.

1:02:42.897 --> 1:02:44.835
Maybe I should join you.

1:02:46.171 --> 1:02:49.136
How about it, Fallon?
You think I can kill someone?

1:02:51.202 --> 1:02:52.374
You know what, Siu-ling?

1:02:52.776 --> 1:02:54.107
With your temperament, yeah,

1:02:54.243 --> 1:02:55.771
I think you probably could.

1:02:56.508 --> 1:03:01.016
But once you go down that road,
there's, there's no coming back
from it, all right?

1:03:01.152 --> 1:03:02.952
I don't think you want
to do that. Let's go.

1:03:03.354 --> 1:03:04.250
Why?

1:03:05.216 --> 1:03:06.318
Are you in trouble?

1:03:08.587 --> 1:03:11.389
I'm a better fighter than you.
Let me help.

1:03:13.362 --> 1:03:15.129
-You're not a better fighter
than me.

1:03:15.264 --> 1:03:17.066
But you know what?
You're a good friend.

1:03:17.568 --> 1:03:20.163
And even though
all you seem to do
is scream obscenities in my face

1:03:20.299 --> 1:03:21.632
and knee me in the bollocks...

1:03:22.635 --> 1:03:24.069
...I don't want to see you
get hurt. So come on.

1:03:24.205 --> 1:03:26.206
-We need to go.

1:03:29.846 --> 1:03:33.613
<i>Well, look who it is. Silas,</i>
<i>The San Francisco Strangler.</i>

1:03:33.748 --> 1:03:36.818
<i>Apparently, this Brad Pitt</i>
<i>wannabe used to be a model,</i>

1:03:36.953 --> 1:03:40.117
<i>but when a photographer made</i>
<i>the fatal mistake</i>
<i>of calling him fat,</i>

1:03:40.252 --> 1:03:43.425
<i>Silas strangled him to death</i>
<i>and has never</i>
<i>looked back since.</i>

1:03:43.561 --> 1:03:46.791
<i>He's as vicious as a viper,</i>
<i>with a grip like an anaconda.</i>

1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:50.597
Bravo. That was beautiful.

1:03:50.733 --> 1:03:54.003
-Is this<i> pok kai</i>
a friend of yours?
-We're not friends yet.

1:03:54.572 --> 1:03:57.534
-But it's a lovely day for it,
isn't it?
-Lovely day for what?

1:03:57.669 --> 1:04:00.207
For choking overprivileged
little piggies.

1:04:02.141 --> 1:04:03.340
None of those here, mate.

1:04:03.476 --> 1:04:04.746
We both know
there's at least one.

1:04:04.882 --> 1:04:07.245
And I'm going to huff and puff

1:04:07.381 --> 1:04:10.012
and strangle
that little porky pig.

1:04:10.148 --> 1:04:12.622
You know what, man?
I'm not sure
that's how the rhyme goes.

1:04:12.757 --> 1:04:14.683
But why don't you do me a favor?

1:04:14.819 --> 1:04:17.126
Take your flash ass mac
and your shit jeans

1:04:17.261 --> 1:04:19.054
and piss off before you get
your head kicked in.

1:04:20.766 --> 1:04:22.692
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1:04:23.127 --> 1:04:26.430
-I heard you were arrogant.
-I heard you were
a throbbing twat.

1:04:26.566 --> 1:04:28.064
So I'm guessing
both rumors were true.

1:04:30.406 --> 1:04:33.135
Now, now, there's no need
for language like that.

1:04:33.271 --> 1:04:37.508
<i>Which brings us back to Poco.</i>
<i>Poco, The Killer Clown.</i>

1:04:37.643 --> 1:04:39.247
<i>Now, they say</i>
<i>he was born in a brothel</i>

1:04:39.382 --> 1:04:41.343
<i>and is as tightly wound</i>
<i>as a Jack in the Box...</i>

1:04:41.479 --> 1:04:44.447
<i>-...just one handle crank</i>
<i>away from snapping.</i>

1:04:44.883 --> 1:04:47.085
<i>I thought this guy was supposed</i>
<i>to be an urban myth,</i>

1:04:47.220 --> 1:04:48.789
<i>but he looks pretty real to me.</i>

1:04:48.925 --> 1:04:50.257
So now there's a clown.

1:04:50.393 --> 1:04:51.987
-I don't like clowns, Fallon.
-Uh...

1:04:52.123 --> 1:04:55.498
<i>♪ Is it something I said?</i>
<i>I knew she was dead ♪</i>

1:04:55.634 --> 1:04:58.330
<i>♪ I could have just billed her</i>
<i>Instead I just killed her ♪</i>

1:04:58.466 --> 1:05:01.467
<i>♪ Oh, it's Poco</i>
<i>Poco the Clown ♪</i>

1:05:01.603 --> 1:05:03.333
<i>♪ Dee-dum, dee-dum</i>
<i>dee-dum dee-dum ♪</i>

1:05:03.468 --> 1:05:05.668
<i>♪ Bee-bumpy, bumpy bumpety-bum ♪</i>

1:05:06.271 --> 1:05:08.272
Bum!

1:05:08.407 --> 1:05:10.539
-Oh, piss off, mate.
-Oh!

1:05:10.908 --> 1:05:13.147
Well, cover me in honey
and release the hounds.

1:05:13.649 --> 1:05:16.646
Do you know what I like to do
with pesky little boys like you?

1:05:18.490 --> 1:05:19.584
Beat them.

1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:22.292
Yeah, I bet you do, you weirdo.

1:05:25.093 --> 1:05:27.360
-Shut up.

1:05:27.829 --> 1:05:28.757
Enough!

1:05:29.226 --> 1:05:30.530
Get lost, clown.

1:05:30.899 --> 1:05:32.633
This is my prize.

1:05:37.039 --> 1:05:38.140
That's it.

1:05:41.109 --> 1:05:42.276
<i>Adiós.</i>

1:05:43.077 --> 1:05:44.977
And for you, you're dead.

1:05:45.413 --> 1:05:47.250
The same
with your little girlfriend.

1:05:47.853 --> 1:05:49.247
But it won't be a swift death.

1:05:49.382 --> 1:05:52.388
Oh, no. It'll be nice and sexy,

1:05:53.091 --> 1:05:54.354
one where I really get
to know her.

1:05:54.489 --> 1:05:57.055
You know the type, Fallon.
I'm going to take

1:05:57.191 --> 1:05:58.361
-a great--

1:06:00.024 --> 1:06:03.429
Well, that's one less horse
in the race, eh, kids.

1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:08.203
So, where's the birthday boy?

1:06:08.339 --> 1:06:10.740
I bet he's so excited
that Poco's at his party.

1:06:10.875 --> 1:06:13.406
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

1:06:13.541 --> 1:06:15.743
You are a sneaky little thing,
aren't you?

1:06:26.286 --> 1:06:27.750
I think he broke my septum.

1:06:44.742 --> 1:06:46.037
Bitch!

1:07:20.373 --> 1:07:22.143
I almost felt that.

1:07:22.545 --> 1:07:25.247
Yeah, I heard about
your condition, you freak.

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:26.814
Is that true, then?

1:07:27.183 --> 1:07:28.811
You really can't feel any pain?

1:07:45.736 --> 1:07:47.137
None whatsoever.

1:07:48.171 --> 1:07:51.570
Congenital insensitivity
to pain.

1:07:53.241 --> 1:07:55.009
Isn't this one for the archives?

1:08:54.133 --> 1:08:55.403
God...

1:09:18.695 --> 1:09:22.028
If, if you lick it,
I'll let you squeeze my nerves.

1:09:37.979 --> 1:09:39.843
Ooh.

1:09:40.916 --> 1:09:41.609
Painful?

1:10:32.902 --> 1:10:33.495
Painful?

1:10:33.630 --> 1:10:35.431
-No.

1:10:38.603 --> 1:10:39.742
How about that? Come on.

1:10:40.111 --> 1:10:41.304
You must have felt that one.

1:10:41.439 --> 1:10:43.678
I did feel that.

1:10:44.281 --> 1:10:46.646
-Hmm.
-And it felt...

1:10:47.279 --> 1:10:49.015
...good.

1:11:05.664 --> 1:11:06.736
-Come here.

1:11:12.336 --> 1:11:16.207
Is that all
you've got, you dirty pighead?

Huh.

1:14:51.490 --> 1:14:52.595
Nice.

Now, that...

We need to go.

1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:29.699
Siu-ling, you all right?

1:15:30.101 --> 1:15:30.996
Where is he?

1:15:31.631 --> 1:15:33.000
I choked him.

1:15:33.402 --> 1:15:34.868
I think he's dead.

1:15:35.536 --> 1:15:36.969
Oh, okay. Okay.

1:15:39.541 --> 1:15:40.775
And how did that feel?

1:15:44.841 --> 1:15:47.045
Pretty good.

1:15:51.122 --> 1:15:52.314
I done it.

1:15:52.883 --> 1:15:54.222
I shit it out!

1:16:02.728 --> 1:16:03.963
<i>Bollocks!</i>

1:16:08.433 --> 1:16:10.333
I'd think very hard
about your next move, mate.

1:16:10.802 --> 1:16:13.841
If you so much
as fucking flinch,
I'll torch the both of you.

1:16:14.477 --> 1:16:15.609
Why would you do that?

1:16:16.078 --> 1:16:18.344
Because I'm a fucking
sore loser. That's why.

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:19.643
So it is true.

1:16:20.345 --> 1:16:23.984
The famous Accident Man,
once a great hunter...

1:16:24.687 --> 1:16:27.657
...has now become a bodyguard.

1:16:29.793 --> 1:16:31.991
-You think you're fast enough?
-Try me.

1:16:34.097 --> 1:16:37.533
I could slit his throat
and your little courtesan's

1:16:37.669 --> 1:16:39.528
-before you could even blink.

1:16:40.931 --> 1:16:44.302
This thing spits out napalm
like an 80-year-old man's
piss pipe.

1:16:44.438 --> 1:16:47.802
No telling where it's gonna go,
but please be my guest.

1:16:50.445 --> 1:16:51.307
Come here.

1:16:53.309 --> 1:16:55.714
I wonder
if I could kick your ass.

1:16:55.850 --> 1:16:58.485
No dirty tricks, no accidents.

1:16:58.921 --> 1:17:01.316
Just you and me
in a martial combat.

1:17:02.219 --> 1:17:06.663
-I will fuck you in the lungs,
you piece of shit!
-Stay out of this, Siu-ling.

1:17:08.332 --> 1:17:09.295
Eh, listen, mate.

1:17:09.831 --> 1:17:10.997
You want a crack at the title?

1:17:11.895 --> 1:17:13.034
Be my guest.

1:17:13.937 --> 1:17:15.436
You better
leave him breathing, though.

1:17:16.472 --> 1:17:19.335
You do that,
we can go round and round
right now, if you fancy it.

1:17:22.609 --> 1:17:23.878
Very well.

1:17:24.746 --> 1:17:26.476
This one is going nowhere.

1:17:51.301 --> 1:17:52.939
-I'll take this fool.
-No.

1:18:02.553 --> 1:18:03.918
You're gonna pay for that.

1:18:05.049 --> 1:18:06.723
No, I don't think so.

1:19:26.670 --> 1:19:28.530
So this is what it feels like...

1:19:29.974 --> 1:19:32.171
-...to be a loser.

1:19:36.139 --> 1:19:37.913
Whoo! Hoo-hoo.

1:19:39.383 --> 1:19:40.278
Mike-san...

1:19:41.313 --> 1:19:43.644
-...are we done?

1:19:49.526 --> 1:19:50.519
Disappointing.

1:19:51.892 --> 1:19:53.390
Uh, we ain't done, mate.

1:19:55.961 --> 1:19:57.064
We ain't done.

1:20:00.570 --> 1:20:01.464
You know what?

1:20:04.602 --> 1:20:06.673
I never took a kicking
I didn't learn from.

1:20:11.444 --> 1:20:13.113
So why don't we
try that again, yeah?

1:20:14.550 --> 1:20:15.445
Very well.

1:20:27.158 --> 1:20:28.491
Try to keep up this time.

1:21:37.930 --> 1:21:39.034
Game over,

1:21:39.537 --> 1:21:40.563
Accident Man.

1:22:03.090 --> 1:22:04.224
Well, that's enough of that.

1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:10.296
Ray.

1:22:12.196 --> 1:22:13.728
Ray.

1:22:22.109 --> 1:22:24.343
Get out here, you bastard!

1:22:25.776 --> 1:22:28.748
Ray, don't do him, please.
What about Fred?

1:22:29.318 --> 1:22:31.684
What about him?
Collateral damage, eh.

1:22:31.820 --> 1:22:34.784
Just like
the other Oasis members
back in London you murdered.

1:22:35.990 --> 1:22:37.592
Like you give a fuck.

1:22:38.062 --> 1:22:40.258
I said, get out of here,
you little shit.

1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:43.130
Look, I don't blame you
for being pissed off at me.

1:22:43.265 --> 1:22:45.001
-All right? I don't blame you--
-Pissed?

1:22:45.570 --> 1:22:46.393
You ruined me.

1:22:46.796 --> 1:22:48.537
Everything I worked
my whole life for

1:22:48.673 --> 1:22:49.704
gone because of you.

1:22:50.273 --> 1:22:52.300
And once I kill
this little piece of shit,

1:22:52.436 --> 1:22:55.873
I won't need anybody
because I'll have my millions
to keep me company.

1:22:56.008 --> 1:22:56.840
Yeah, maybe.

1:22:58.613 --> 1:23:00.709
You'll still be a miserable
old bastard, won't you?

1:23:01.644 --> 1:23:03.617
-Yeah?
-Get out of my way

1:23:03.752 --> 1:23:06.517
or, I swear to God, I will blow
your fucking head apart here.

1:23:06.653 --> 1:23:08.121
No, you won't.
You wouldn't do it in London,

1:23:08.257 --> 1:23:09.550
you're not
gonna do it now, are you?

1:23:09.685 --> 1:23:11.259
-Don't test me, boy.
-Look,

1:23:11.394 --> 1:23:13.024
I'm sorry about
what happened in London, okay?

1:23:13.159 --> 1:23:14.325
I'm sorry about that.

1:23:14.894 --> 1:23:16.828
But you're gonna have to take
some responsibility for that

1:23:16.964 --> 1:23:19.898
because you're the one
that brought me up
since I was a kid.

1:23:20.033 --> 1:23:21.433
Yet you rioted.

1:23:22.403 --> 1:23:24.236
And in the words
of the immortal bard,

1:23:24.372 --> 1:23:25.567
"How sharper
than a serpent's tooth

1:23:25.703 --> 1:23:27.304
is the scorn
of a thankless child."

1:23:27.439 --> 1:23:29.904
Grateful is what you should be.

1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:32.740
-Without me, you'd be nothing.
-No, it's because of you

1:23:32.876 --> 1:23:35.481
that I'm a fucking asshole,
all right?

1:23:36.617 --> 1:23:38.920
It's because of you
that I don't have any mates,

1:23:39.055 --> 1:23:40.617
and I keep people at a distance

1:23:40.752 --> 1:23:42.156
because you brought me up
to not give a shit

1:23:42.291 --> 1:23:43.985
about anyone by myself,
didn't you?

1:23:44.121 --> 1:23:47.492
So the only reason I am
the way I am is because of you.

1:23:49.733 --> 1:23:50.629
And you know what?

1:23:51.098 --> 1:23:52.630
Since I bumped into Fred,

1:23:52.766 --> 1:23:55.236
and I found out what it's
like to, to have a real mate

1:23:55.371 --> 1:23:57.239
in your life, someone
you actually care about,

1:23:57.374 --> 1:24:00.370
it made me realize
that you were full of shit.

1:24:00.505 --> 1:24:02.841
-You what?
-Yeah, you heard.

1:24:02.976 --> 1:24:05.640
You're wrong to think
that having mates around
was bad for you,

1:24:05.776 --> 1:24:07.348
and I was an idiot
to listen to you.

1:24:07.483 --> 1:24:09.416
Oh, no, no, no.
You're an idiot if you don't.

1:24:09.986 --> 1:24:13.080
We're killers, son.
That's where it has to be.
That's what it takes.

1:24:14.550 --> 1:24:17.421
Is it what it takes, though?
Because I know
we're not meant to have

1:24:17.557 --> 1:24:18.961
a moral compass
and all that shit,

1:24:19.096 --> 1:24:20.894
but even killers
need mates, right?

1:24:21.463 --> 1:24:23.660
People that you care about.
You need family.

1:24:23.796 --> 1:24:25.828
You need people
that give a shit about you.

1:24:25.964 --> 1:24:28.303
Because I'll tell you what,
if you don't have that...

1:24:30.007 --> 1:24:33.402
...well, then you're gonna
just be a fucking miserable
old bastard, aren't you?

1:24:33.538 --> 1:24:35.309
-Like you.

1:24:37.278 --> 1:24:38.546
You're not gonna shoot me, Ray?

1:24:40.647 --> 1:24:42.514
And you're not gonna
let Fred die either.

1:24:50.155 --> 1:24:51.593
Get out of here.

1:25:14.114 --> 1:25:16.784
God!

1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:25.759
Nice speech.

1:25:26.629 --> 1:25:28.692
-How long have you been
working on it?

1:25:31.631 --> 1:25:33.466
Since you threw me
out of London.

1:25:36.974 --> 1:25:40.308
Hand over that tracking device
in case there's any more Muppets
after you.

1:25:46.516 --> 1:25:48.481
On second thoughts,
just chuck it out, will you?

1:25:57.123 --> 1:25:58.088
That was...

1:25:58.891 --> 1:26:01.857
...the only nice gift
my mama ever gave me.

1:26:11.776 --> 1:26:12.675
Yeah, I know.

1:26:13.644 --> 1:26:16.476
That's what we have to protect
in order to keep Fred alive.

1:26:17.607 --> 1:26:19.215
What a parlor wank.

1:26:20.883 --> 1:26:21.782
Well...

1:26:22.551 --> 1:26:24.714
...we better get this scrote
back to his mommy

1:26:24.850 --> 1:26:27.784
and get our little
finicky bugger back, eh?

1:26:29.587 --> 1:26:31.590
Yeah.

1:26:32.125 --> 1:26:33.922
Yeah.

1:26:36.667 --> 1:26:37.327
Now,

1:26:37.796 --> 1:26:39.664
we can't send you back
to your old dear

1:26:39.799 --> 1:26:41.268
covered in your own shit
and

1:26:41.404 --> 1:26:43.337
can we now,
you abominable creature?

1:26:43.706 --> 1:26:46.407
Get yourself cleaned up
and put on a fucking suit.

1:26:47.771 --> 1:26:49.641
Oh, no, those are Fred's suits.

1:26:50.946 --> 1:26:51.638
Really?

1:26:51.774 --> 1:26:52.847
Fallon?

1:26:52.982 --> 1:26:54.778
Shit! Siu-ling?

1:26:57.281 --> 1:26:58.386
Siu-ling.

1:26:58.821 --> 1:26:59.717
You okay?

1:27:00.858 --> 1:27:01.987
My head hurts.

1:27:02.456 --> 1:27:03.988
What happened to that<i> pok kai?</i>

1:27:06.155 --> 1:27:09.496
That's a fucking horror show.
Did you do that?

1:27:10.096 --> 1:27:10.992
Yeah.

1:27:11.902 --> 1:27:13.460
Well, kind of.

1:27:13.596 --> 1:27:16.371
Not bad. Not bad.

1:27:17.239 --> 1:27:18.802
What happened to your face?

1:27:29.316 --> 1:27:30.918
Be nice to your mom.

1:27:33.090 --> 1:27:35.190
My mom is gonna be so angry

1:27:35.326 --> 1:27:37.088
when she finds out
how you treat me.

1:27:37.524 --> 1:27:39.260
You and your assassin friends

1:27:39.396 --> 1:27:41.758
kicking me around
like a fucking football.

1:27:41.893 --> 1:27:43.564
I reckon she'd be
more angry about the fact

1:27:43.699 --> 1:27:46.760
that you shit yourself live
on CCTV, don't you?

1:27:46.896 --> 1:27:48.236
Show her footage, if you want.

1:27:48.372 --> 1:27:50.539
-You wouldn't dare.
-Wouldn't I?

1:27:50.974 --> 1:27:52.207
Anyway, calm down.

1:27:52.343 --> 1:27:53.936
Don't want you
shitting yourself again.

1:28:00.279 --> 1:28:03.151
We feared the worst
after we lost the signal.

1:28:04.121 --> 1:28:07.652
Well, your little soldier
was a big boy and, uh,
went potty, didn't you?

1:28:07.788 --> 1:28:10.355
Can you please
do something about him?

1:28:10.490 --> 1:28:12.126
Look at the fucking state of me.

1:28:12.261 --> 1:28:13.527
Since we are here, I presume

1:28:13.662 --> 1:28:16.361
you have taken care
of all our problems.

1:28:16.497 --> 1:28:18.796
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

1:28:18.931 --> 1:28:21.670
<i>-Ciao,</i> Mama.
<i>-Ciao,</i> Dante.

1:28:22.072 --> 1:28:23.639
-Well--
-Mama!

1:28:23.774 --> 1:28:24.839
Tito!

1:28:25.374 --> 1:28:26.901
Another word from you,<i> figlio,</i>

1:28:27.037 --> 1:28:28.775
and I will take care
of you myself.

1:28:28.911 --> 1:28:32.876
I'm sure that nine million euros
would help me with my grief.

1:28:34.345 --> 1:28:35.643
So?

1:28:36.179 --> 1:28:38.716
Well, thanks to me,
he's safe as houses.

1:28:38.852 --> 1:28:40.114
Now, we've got rid
of that tracking device,

1:28:40.249 --> 1:28:43.022
and those assassins
have popped their clogs.

1:28:43.157 --> 1:28:44.125
All of them?

1:28:44.261 --> 1:28:45.620
That one we know about, yeah.

1:28:45.755 --> 1:28:47.061
What about the others?

1:28:47.197 --> 1:28:48.529
I can't worry about things

1:28:48.665 --> 1:28:51.565
we don't know about yet,
can I, you stupid book?

1:28:53.196 --> 1:28:55.804
I have to say
I'm impressed, Mr. Fallon.

1:28:56.740 --> 1:28:59.767
For a man who we only trusted
to crash a car or two,

1:28:59.902 --> 1:29:01.570
you have truly outdone yourself.

1:29:01.706 --> 1:29:03.606
So bravo to you,<i> signore.</i>

1:29:03.741 --> 1:29:05.140
You know what, Mrs. Zuuzer,

1:29:05.275 --> 1:29:08.446
hearing you say that
makes everything worthwhile.

1:29:08.582 --> 1:29:10.945
Sarcasm suits you,

1:29:11.081 --> 1:29:13.451
but your egotism will be
the death of you.

1:29:13.586 --> 1:29:15.090
I'll be sure to see to that

1:29:15.226 --> 1:29:17.925
if I ever see your face again.

1:29:18.294 --> 1:29:19.356
I've heard that one before.

1:29:19.491 --> 1:29:20.825
I do not doubt it.

1:29:22.859 --> 1:29:24.466
How are we doing, Finicky?

1:29:25.100 --> 1:29:25.995
All right, Mike.

1:29:27.070 --> 1:29:28.602
Nice weekend?

1:29:29.535 --> 1:29:30.968
Not really, mate, no.

1:29:31.804 --> 1:29:33.975
So, uh, should we
get on with it?

1:29:34.110 --> 1:29:38.847
What, he,
what, he just gets to leave,
does he, huh?

1:29:38.983 --> 1:29:40.546
This fucking ape?

1:29:40.682 --> 1:29:42.846
He, uh, he,
he beat me like a dog.

1:29:42.981 --> 1:29:44.915
He abused me,
threatened to kill me.

1:29:45.051 --> 1:29:46.820
He said some pretty
fucking terrible things

1:29:46.956 --> 1:29:48.820
-about you as well by the wa--
-<i> Basta!</i>

1:29:49.927 --> 1:29:50.822
<i>Cuccia!</i>

1:29:53.523 --> 1:29:54.727
Come on.

1:29:55.362 --> 1:29:56.128
Come on, Fred.

1:29:58.568 --> 1:30:00.568
What are you looking at,
you fucking pleb?

1:30:03.404 --> 1:30:04.506
You all right, mate?

1:30:04.941 --> 1:30:05.838
Yeah?

1:30:06.474 --> 1:30:07.870
We'll call it a day, then, yeah?

1:30:08.006 --> 1:30:10.741
We had an agreement,
which I'll honor,

1:30:10.877 --> 1:30:12.948
but show me the respect
I deserve.

1:30:13.083 --> 1:30:14.449
Leave this island,

1:30:14.818 --> 1:30:18.348
and go and play with
your little mishaps elsewhere.

1:30:18.483 --> 1:30:19.752
Be happy to.

1:30:21.421 --> 1:30:22.557
Come on, Fred.

1:30:23.861 --> 1:30:26.354
What? That's it? What,
you're gonna let him walk away?

1:30:27.123 --> 1:30:29.531
Yeah, yeah bye,
you fucking twat!

1:30:29.666 --> 1:30:34.595
-Mama...

1:30:36.703 --> 1:30:38.603
Ray, what are you doing here?

1:30:39.072 --> 1:30:41.570
-Did you get my note?
-Yeah, he got the note.

1:30:42.106 --> 1:30:44.044
Glad to see
you made an effort, Fred.

1:30:44.479 --> 1:30:45.541
Anyway, first things first.

1:30:45.944 --> 1:30:47.743
Let's see
if your Savile Row skills

1:30:47.878 --> 1:30:49.149
are up to scratch, shall we?

1:30:49.285 --> 1:30:50.949
Oh, is this one of mine?

1:30:51.618 --> 1:30:53.753
-Fuck you!

1:31:00.630 --> 1:31:01.624
-Yes!
-I can't believe that.

1:31:01.759 --> 1:31:03.058
I told you it'd work.

1:31:03.193 --> 1:31:04.928
Mate, I thought
it was a crap idea,

1:31:05.064 --> 1:31:06.830
but that scored
like bleedin' Beckham

1:31:06.966 --> 1:31:08.662
I'll never doubt you
again, buddy.

1:31:10.168 --> 1:31:12.073
Not just a hatrack,
eh, Mike.

1:31:12.209 --> 1:31:13.201
No, mate.

1:31:19.613 --> 1:31:21.583
All right, get in, lads. Get in.

1:31:26.282 --> 1:31:28.451
And then she fell off
her barstool.

1:31:31.728 --> 1:31:34.860
Hey, Fred, there's
someone here to see you.

1:31:35.528 --> 1:31:36.657
It's me, Leylo.

1:31:38.766 --> 1:31:40.096
Is that really you, Fred?

1:31:41.737 --> 1:31:43.701
-Oh, my dear, sweet friend.
-Ooh.

1:31:43.836 --> 1:31:45.266
-Come here.

1:31:47.409 --> 1:31:49.406
Oh, fuck me sideways.

1:31:51.345 --> 1:31:53.142
<i>So Fred finally met</i>
<i>the love of his life,</i>

1:31:53.277 --> 1:31:55.148
<i>and they lived happily</i>
<i>ever after.</i>

1:31:55.283 --> 1:31:58.386
<i> Did they? Bollocks!</i>
<i>Lasted about a fortnight.</i>

1:31:58.521 --> 1:32:01.817
<i>And when she realized</i>
<i>Fred was a stone-cold killer,</i>
<i>she scapered.</i>

1:32:01.953 --> 1:32:05.552
<i>He got over it, though.</i>
<i>Big Ray decided</i>
<i>to put his differences aside.</i>

1:32:05.688 --> 1:32:07.859
<i>And with the nine million</i>
<i>from the Zuuzer job,</i>

1:32:07.995 --> 1:32:10.057
<i>we parlayed that</i>
<i>into a new outfit</i>

1:32:10.192 --> 1:32:11.663
<i>and the world was our oyster.</i>

1:32:12.032 --> 1:32:13.728
<i>So, it was on</i>
<i>to the next chapter,</i>

1:32:14.097 --> 1:32:15.671
<i>which, for a guy like me,</i>

1:32:15.806 --> 1:32:18.031
