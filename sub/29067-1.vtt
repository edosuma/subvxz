02:06.560 --> 02:08.073
David Steele was my father.

02:45.756 --> 02:46.589
Peter.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.438
I'm so sorry, Peter.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.298
So sudden like this.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.500
Thank you, Mr. Hearst.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.418
They said it was a
drunk driving accident.

02:57.420 --> 02:58.253
Unfortunately.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.718
I hope they catch the guy.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.608
Just terrible these days.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.010
There was no other driver.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.500
It was a one-car accident.

03:10.010 --> 03:10.843
It was a tree.

03:12.745 --> 03:13.662
Oh.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.222
Oh.

03:16.224 --> 03:17.057
Oh, well.

03:22.420 --> 03:23.803
I should probably go.

03:30.810 --> 03:31.818
What's this?

03:31.820 --> 03:33.288
Your dead father's ashes.

03:33.290 --> 03:34.845
I know what it is.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.548
Why do I have it?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.035
It's normal for the remains
to travel with the family

03:39.037 --> 03:40.773
for the final resting place.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.333
Oh.

03:49.690 --> 03:50.947
Can you hold that?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.137
Good morning, Peter.

04:44.139 --> 04:46.108
Did we get a callback from Westchester?

04:46.110 --> 04:47.053
How are you?

04:48.630 --> 04:50.480
Remember, like we've been working on.

04:51.585 --> 04:52.416
Good morning, Stephanie.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.093
Did we get a callback from Westchester?

04:55.470 --> 04:56.323
Eye contact.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.107
I just wanna know you're trying.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.227
That phone is hilarious.

05:05.470 --> 05:07.648
You're looking mighty fancy today.

05:07.650 --> 05:09.118
What's the occasion?

05:09.120 --> 05:10.558
My father's funeral.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.073
So I'm expecting to get a
callback from Westchester today.

05:14.075 --> 05:15.144
Stephanie?

05:15.146 --> 05:16.338
Stephanie, no.

05:16.340 --> 05:18.528
No, Stephanie.

05:18.530 --> 05:21.562
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

05:21.564 --> 05:23.738
Do you remember when you cry,

05:23.740 --> 05:25.998
I get a call from Paul in Human Resources,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.248
and then I have all that
paperwork to fill out.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.363
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:30.365 --> 05:32.608
You know, I'm not good at this.

05:32.610 --> 05:33.443
I know.

05:37.210 --> 05:38.678
It's okay.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.918
Don't you wanna take the
rest of the day or anything?

05:41.920 --> 05:43.108
No, I'm fine.

05:43.110 --> 05:47.208
I just need to leave in a
few to check his house out

05:47.210 --> 05:48.518
and figure out what to do with it.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.448
I will be able to be reached on my cell.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.218
You mean your house.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.798
No, I haven't lived there for years.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.633
So what?

05:58.050 --> 05:59.240
You're gonna go pack up

06:00.510 --> 06:01.793
old childhood memories,

06:05.500 --> 06:07.627
and look at old family photos.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.700
Westchester let me know if they call.

06:50.815 --> 06:53.438
You have 12 new messages.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.136
This is a
message for David Steele.

06:56.138 --> 06:58.552
Message deleted.

06:58.554 --> 06:59.658
Message deleted.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.198
Mr. Steele
this is Leonard Wolfing

07:01.200 --> 07:03.058
at the county assessor's office.

07:03.060 --> 07:06.020
- We have important.
- Message deleted.

07:06.022 --> 07:07.355
Message deleted.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.048
Well, I'm sure you got a
lot to think about right now.

08:28.050 --> 08:28.979
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- There's nothing

08:28.981 --> 08:30.438
we can do about that.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.290
I'm afraid not.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.898
As such, none of this is really in order.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.788
But the good news is it's
all pretty straightforward.

08:36.789 --> 08:39.258
Your father kept things pretty simple.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.868
He had a small equity line

08:40.870 --> 08:43.368
which you'll cover easily if
you choose to sell the house.

08:43.370 --> 08:44.798
I'd like to just sell it

08:44.800 --> 08:45.978
as soon as possible if I can.

08:45.980 --> 08:49.048
I understand that you
probable wanna get back to...

08:49.050 --> 08:51.288
I'm sorry where is it you live?

08:51.290 --> 08:52.668
Queens.

08:52.670 --> 08:53.503
Sunnyside.

08:54.870 --> 08:55.940
That close, huh.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.740
Why did I think it was Chicago
or someplace like that?

09:04.330 --> 09:05.638
Have you been around recently?

09:05.640 --> 09:06.473
No.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.853
Alright, excellent.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.768
Well, as I said, you have a house to sell.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.418
He had a few small assets,

09:15.420 --> 09:17.098
retirement savings, checking,

09:17.100 --> 09:18.958
but really no other major assets.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.960
He had a small line of credit
card debt and a car loan.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.178
But little things here and there.

09:26.180 --> 09:28.430
But all and all the
market value of the house

09:29.270 --> 09:30.828
you should be able to
clear a comfortable sum

09:30.830 --> 09:33.528
after fees etcetera, so.

09:33.530 --> 09:34.580
Did he have a will?

09:35.490 --> 09:36.475
- Excuse me?
- Is there something

09:36.477 --> 09:37.673
I have to sign?

09:40.100 --> 09:41.243
No, I'm afraid not.

09:44.052 --> 09:47.038
You have to forgive me
this is not my area of law.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.643
I'm not really doing this
in any official capacity.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.288
Essentially, as the only child
with your mother predeceased,

09:54.290 --> 09:57.713
you're the only person
with a claim to the assets.

10:00.710 --> 10:01.543
Hey, Peter.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.588
When's the last time you saw him?

10:06.590 --> 10:07.421
Has he paid you?

10:07.423 --> 10:09.178
What is your fee in all of this?

10:09.180 --> 10:12.733
Oh, no, I'm doing this as a friend.

10:13.858 --> 10:14.943
No charge.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.518
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

10:17.520 --> 10:18.978
Actually if you know anyone

10:18.980 --> 10:20.828
in real estate to show the house.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.598
I'll have my assistant
give you a list of agents.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
Thank you.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.967
He was proud of you Peter.

10:32.127 --> 10:33.173
Did he mention me?

10:37.160 --> 10:38.848
Well, sometimes words don't...

10:38.850 --> 10:40.233
Thank you, Mr. Hearst.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.298
You wouldn't
happen to know the latest

11:28.300 --> 11:30.108
tax assessment on the property, would you?

11:30.110 --> 11:30.943
No.

11:31.980 --> 11:35.208
And the plumbing and
electric are they the original?

11:35.210 --> 11:36.668
I don't know.

11:36.670 --> 11:38.738
Did he do any measure of work recently?

11:38.740 --> 11:41.070
Any work orders or permits?

11:41.072 --> 11:41.905
No idea.

11:44.590 --> 11:45.958
Alright, I see.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.548
Well, based on comparables,

11:48.550 --> 11:50.528
you could probably see high fours

11:50.530 --> 11:52.623
or maybe just over 500,000.

11:56.850 --> 12:01.018
Good news for you is that
you're entering a hot season.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.438
Come spring and summer
families are looking to move.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.558
They wanna get their
kids into better schools,

12:05.560 --> 12:07.848
and this neighborhood is great for that.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.380
So if you rip out the carpets

12:11.710 --> 12:14.313
maybe a fresh coat of paint on the walls,

12:15.550 --> 12:19.648
you could probably list
it at 525 maybe even 550.

12:19.650 --> 12:20.998
What are we looking at as is

12:21.000 --> 12:23.198
with furniture and everything?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.838
Uh, well.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.208
I would list it at 475.

12:28.210 --> 12:29.508
You'll get some people in the door.

12:29.510 --> 12:30.423
Let's do 450.

12:32.537 --> 12:33.668
Are you sure?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.878
You'd be leaving a lot
of money on the table.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.346
I'd just like to get this over with.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.605
Would you be open to rentals...

12:40.607 --> 12:42.587
- No.
- To get it occupied?

12:44.181 --> 12:46.097
I understand the memories
must be difficult.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.807
Very difficult.

12:47.809 --> 12:48.913
- Mr. Steele I'm calling from
- Have a nice day.

12:48.915 --> 12:52.238
Northshore University
Hospital Outpatient Services.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.399
We just wanted to confirm with you

12:53.401 --> 12:55.598
the date and time of your appointment.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.228
Please be sure to arrive 15 minutes prior

12:57.230 --> 12:58.948
to the scheduled time to update paperwork.

12:58.950 --> 13:00.878
- Hello.
- Mr. Steele?

13:00.880 --> 13:01.948
Yes, can I give you a different

13:01.950 --> 13:03.568
address and phone number.

13:03.570 --> 13:06.488
I'm not gonna be checking
my father's house regularly.

13:06.490 --> 13:07.488
Excuse me?

13:07.490 --> 13:09.728
I figure you have
insurance forms and bills

13:09.730 --> 13:11.916
from the hospital from the accident.

13:11.918 --> 13:13.928
I was looking for David Steele.

13:13.930 --> 13:14.893
That's my father.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.978
Is this not about his accident?

13:17.980 --> 13:20.628
Right, David Steele is
listed as the family contact

13:20.630 --> 13:21.783
for Francis Steele.

13:23.380 --> 13:24.718
Mr. Steele, are you there?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.368
This is Peter, Peter Steele.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.528
David Steele is my father.

13:28.530 --> 13:29.583
He's deceased.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.588
I'm sorry for
your loss, Mr. Steele.

13:33.590 --> 13:36.738
Francis Steele, Frank.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.298
Are you calling about my Uncle Frank?

13:38.300 --> 13:39.848
Yeah, that sounds correct.

13:39.850 --> 13:41.698
Mr. Steele your Uncle Francis Steele

13:41.700 --> 13:44.588
receives outpatient
treatment on a regular basis.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.618
Your father would routinely
bring him in for his sessions

13:46.620 --> 13:47.518
and take him home.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.924
He's unable to drive himself.

13:49.926 --> 13:52.148
I didn't know Uncle Frank was alive.

13:52.150 --> 13:54.168
Be that as it may, Mr. Steele,

13:54.170 --> 13:56.598
Francis Steele is scheduled
for his outpatient procedure

13:56.600 --> 13:58.418
tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.038
Is there some other member of the family

14:00.040 --> 14:02.058
I should be having this conversation with?

14:02.060 --> 14:03.528
No.

14:03.530 --> 14:04.908
No.

14:04.910 --> 14:05.743
Just me.

14:06.590 --> 14:08.188
Will you be
able to bring Mr. Steele

14:08.190 --> 14:09.690
in for his procedure tomorrow?

14:11.710 --> 14:13.368
Yes, I can.

14:13.370 --> 14:14.918
Okay, thank you.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.418
Please remind him that he
should not have anything

14:16.420 --> 14:18.203
to eat or drink after midnight.

14:19.290 --> 14:20.693
I'm gonna need an address.

14:21.850 --> 14:24.983
We're located at 1000
Plaza Drive, Building Four.

14:24.985 --> 14:26.923
I'm gonna need my uncle's address.

15:18.540 --> 15:20.140
Don't you usually wear shorts?

15:22.220 --> 15:23.051
Excuse me?

15:23.053 --> 15:24.213
Where's the package?

15:26.480 --> 15:28.727
Mia, hey, you have to ask.

15:28.729 --> 15:31.908
You have to ask who's at the door.

15:31.910 --> 15:33.408
Sorry, sorry about that.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.816
How can I help you?

15:34.818 --> 15:36.108
I'm looking for Frank Steele.

15:36.110 --> 15:38.758
Yeah, two floors up, 4P.

15:38.760 --> 15:39.591
I buzzed this apartment, right?

15:39.593 --> 15:41.028
Yeah, yeah.

15:41.030 --> 15:41.861
No, people have to buzz here

15:41.863 --> 15:44.833
'cause he broke his buzzer three times.

15:45.890 --> 15:47.040
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.768
- Congratulations.
- What?

15:49.770 --> 15:51.578
Your shirt you're pregnant.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.058
No, this.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.463
No, it's laundry day.

15:56.346 --> 15:57.254
Oh.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.087
It's fine.

15:58.089 --> 15:59.165
It's totally fine.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.078
No, it's totally fine.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.322
How come you're here to see Frank?

16:02.324 --> 16:03.874
I'm taking him to the doctor.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.218
Doesn't someone normally
come by and take him?

16:07.220 --> 16:09.185
They're kind of loud, sort of mean?

16:09.187 --> 16:10.508
That's my father.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.103
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:13.670 --> 16:16.568
I'm sure you just have to get
to know him then it's great.

16:16.570 --> 16:18.178
No, actually you don't
need to get to know him.

16:18.180 --> 16:19.013
He's dead.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.015
- Jesus.
- No, it's all right.

16:22.017 --> 16:23.717
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.658
- It's all right.
- Okay.

16:26.660 --> 16:28.218
This is one of the most
awkward conversations

16:28.220 --> 16:29.618
I've had in a very long time.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.568
It is not the most
awkward one I've had this week.

16:31.570 --> 16:32.403
Really?

16:36.390 --> 16:39.433
My father died.

16:41.170 --> 16:42.003
Yeah.

16:47.960 --> 16:48.793
Bye.

17:03.630 --> 17:05.880
Yeah, I'm coming.

17:10.599 --> 17:11.750
Frank?

17:11.752 --> 17:12.873
- Uncle Frank?
- Yeah.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.198
Peter it's David's son.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.078
I know who you are,

17:18.079 --> 17:19.430
and I don't like the beard.

17:21.839 --> 17:22.897
The hospital called.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.973
Yeah, where's your father?

17:26.393 --> 17:27.762
Where's your father?

17:37.262 --> 17:38.668
I'm sorry we didn't reach you.

17:38.670 --> 17:40.548
- Who's we?
- Me.

17:40.550 --> 17:42.938
Me, I'm sorry I didn't reach you.

17:42.940 --> 17:43.778
I didn't know how to reach you.

17:43.780 --> 17:45.368
Reach me?

17:45.370 --> 17:47.388
Yeah, I didn't have a current address.

17:47.390 --> 17:48.221
I've lived
here in this apartment

17:48.223 --> 17:50.198
since you were 12-years-old.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.488
Yeah, right, sorry.

17:52.490 --> 17:53.321
Besides, I
wouldn't have been any

17:53.323 --> 17:54.848
use to you anyhow.

17:54.850 --> 17:56.078
You could've been at the funeral.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.213
Oh, God no.

17:57.215 --> 17:58.158
Don't get me wrong.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.648
But when you get to where
I am you go to a funeral,

18:00.650 --> 18:01.928
feels like the barbershop.

18:01.930 --> 18:04.168
You hang around long enough
and you're a mess with a cut.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.275
That's funny.

18:06.110 --> 18:06.943
No, it's not.

18:09.390 --> 18:10.714
Right.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.788
About the only
privilege to being old and sick

18:12.790 --> 18:15.248
you get to do whatever the hell you want.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.148
People stopped telling me what to do.

18:17.150 --> 18:18.658
Sounds pretty good.

18:18.660 --> 18:20.966
You want something to drink, anything?

18:20.968 --> 18:22.208
I'm fine.

18:22.210 --> 18:25.218
Good, 'cause I'm pretty
sure this is my last one.

18:28.960 --> 18:29.791
The hospital said you shouldn't have

18:29.793 --> 18:30.958
anything to eat or drink.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.460
What's it gonna do, kill me?

18:33.420 --> 18:34.253
Maybe.

18:37.930 --> 18:39.480
Let's go, on your feet.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.088
You know where the hell you're going?

18:43.090 --> 18:43.923
Yeah.

18:49.684 --> 18:50.517
What?

18:51.873 --> 18:52.706
Nothing.

18:54.026 --> 18:54.859
Nothing.

19:00.837 --> 19:01.670
Mr. Steele.

19:03.990 --> 19:06.888
Whoa, what are you doing?

19:06.890 --> 19:09.391
You getting a shot back there
today I don't know about.

19:09.393 --> 19:10.628
Sit down, kid.

19:10.630 --> 19:12.830
I don't need you to
hold my hand back there.

19:39.842 --> 19:41.428
So where are you taking me for lunch?

19:41.430 --> 19:42.598
Lunch?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.338
Yeah, lunch what'd you think
you were gonna just drop me

19:44.340 --> 19:46.388
unceremoniously back at the house?

19:46.390 --> 19:47.263
Yeah, right.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.901
Lunch.

19:49.903 --> 19:51.658
I don't really know
any places around here.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.308
There was only one place your
father and I could agree on,

19:54.310 --> 19:57.963
a Chinese joint up by my
house not far from me.

19:58.888 --> 20:01.498
What, you got a problem with Chinese?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.258
You afraid to get a little
rice stuck in your beard there.

20:04.260 --> 20:05.093
Sounds great.

20:12.770 --> 20:13.603
Hi.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.658
What's this?

20:21.660 --> 20:22.528
That's his.

20:22.530 --> 20:24.358
He gets the paper here?

20:24.360 --> 20:27.548
The guy from the newsstand
next door banned him.

20:27.550 --> 20:29.298
Do you know why he was banned?

20:29.300 --> 20:32.278
Shoplifting couple of times.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.653
If that ain't anti-Semite.

20:35.605 --> 20:37.272
You're not Jewish.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.680
So what can I get you?

20:41.420 --> 20:42.888
Listen, kid.

20:42.890 --> 20:45.868
You think you can run to the
OTB place a few bets for me?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.848
Why, you get banned from there too?

20:47.850 --> 20:49.453
That one was complete BS.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.253
Yeah, the food here is terrible.

20:57.330 --> 20:58.980
Best to just stick with the soup.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.588
So let me know when
the next appointment is...

21:06.590 --> 21:07.740
Don't worry about it.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.081
You sure?

21:10.083 --> 21:11.128
I said don't worry about it.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.038
I'm a big boy.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.288
If I need to get there,
I'll figure it out.

21:14.290 --> 21:15.123
Okay, but.

21:34.870 --> 21:37.678
Do you wanna know what this is?

21:37.680 --> 21:38.868
Yeah, you?

21:38.870 --> 21:41.863
It's a G.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.913
At least I think it's a G.

21:44.810 --> 21:47.473
I've only had two lessons.

21:47.475 --> 21:49.458
Mia, don't be terrorizing the building.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.608
Go practice in your room.

21:51.610 --> 21:52.948
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:52.950 --> 21:55.223
Hi, hey, how was the doctor?

21:56.090 --> 21:57.008
Weird.

21:57.010 --> 21:57.841
Yeah.

21:57.843 --> 22:01.413
Well, I mean, it's so kind
that you're taking him.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.720
I don't think he needs me.

22:04.648 --> 22:08.018
Well, everyone needs someone, right?

22:08.020 --> 22:12.163
I mean to say I don't
think that he wants me.

22:12.165 --> 22:15.915
Probably means that
he needs you even more.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.608
When is your next appointment?

22:26.610 --> 22:27.443
Thursday.

22:28.350 --> 22:29.398
We're eating someplace else.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.233
No we're not!

23:09.582 --> 23:11.195
Are you with Mr. Steele?

23:11.197 --> 23:12.697
- Yes.
- Come on back please.

23:19.800 --> 23:20.850
Is he almost ready?

23:21.710 --> 23:22.875
Yes, they're finishing
up with him right now.

23:22.877 --> 23:24.688
He should be out shortly.

23:24.690 --> 23:27.198
I just wanted to address a few

23:27.200 --> 23:29.578
concerns we have regarding his treatment.

23:29.580 --> 23:32.588
Do you know if he's been taking
his medication on a regular?

23:32.590 --> 23:33.578
No.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.062
No, he hasn't, or no you don't know?

23:38.760 --> 23:40.148
What about his diet?

23:40.150 --> 23:41.827
How about that how's that been?

23:44.710 --> 23:45.728
Mister?

23:45.730 --> 23:48.238
Steele, you can call me Peter please.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.408
Mr. Steele how long has it been

23:50.410 --> 23:52.528
since you last saw your uncle?

23:52.530 --> 23:53.857
Years.

23:53.859 --> 23:55.748
Are you familiar with
Acute Myeloid Leukemia?

23:55.750 --> 23:57.958
Just from the pamphlet in the lobby.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.498
Well, I'm afraid we're past

23:59.500 --> 24:00.538
the point of treating his disease,

24:00.540 --> 24:03.378
and now we're in a course of
pain and symptom management.

24:03.380 --> 24:04.213
He's terminal?

24:05.540 --> 24:06.398
I like to put it this way.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.138
We're reshaping what
time he does have left.

24:09.140 --> 24:10.608
How much time is that?

24:10.610 --> 24:12.138
Well, that's where it gets tricky.

24:12.140 --> 24:13.938
If he takes his medication,
comes to his treatments,

24:13.940 --> 24:15.498
and stays relatively healthy,

24:15.500 --> 24:17.068
he might have a year or more.

24:17.070 --> 24:19.548
But if he's not taking
his treatment seriously,

24:19.550 --> 24:21.698
there's simply no one of
telling what he's in for.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.543
I appreciate that.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.968
But I don't know how to
communicate with my uncle.

24:27.970 --> 24:30.038
I don't know how to talk to him,

24:30.040 --> 24:32.948
and even if I did, I'm
pretty sure he wouldn't talk.

24:32.950 --> 24:34.678
Mr. Steele, I'm not here to judge.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.828
I'm certainly not in a position to have

24:35.830 --> 24:38.628
a philosophical debate
about how he lives his life.

24:38.630 --> 24:41.398
I just thought I'd try to
enlist your help on our side.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.228
I mean no disrespect,
but how do you know

24:43.230 --> 24:45.080
how he should approach his treatment?

24:46.210 --> 24:48.068
I understand, Mr. Steele.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.428
I just thought it
warranted your attention.

24:49.430 --> 24:52.293
How about bone marrow?

24:53.260 --> 24:54.468
Bone marrow?

24:54.470 --> 24:57.358
I read in the pamphlet
that there is treatments.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.138
I'm afraid we're past that option.

24:59.140 --> 25:02.413
Could I have been a
donor as a relative of his?

25:03.460 --> 25:04.948
We would've started there.

25:04.950 --> 25:06.478
You know, I have some
information in the lobby that

25:06.480 --> 25:07.588
explains all that to you, you
want me to grab it for you?

25:07.590 --> 25:09.533
No, there's no point.

25:17.786 --> 25:20.369
You always breathe like that?

25:30.960 --> 25:33.148
You know, you can talk.

25:33.150 --> 25:34.383
You can talk to me.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.138
Do you really think you're dying?

25:39.140 --> 25:41.040
Okay, we don't need to talk.

25:44.149 --> 25:47.688
I mean, does it feel like you're dying?

25:47.690 --> 25:50.538
That's what I've been told many times.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.238
Do you believe it?

25:52.240 --> 25:54.753
I feel like shit everyday.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.478
Some days worse than others.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.663
I realized one thing.

25:59.550 --> 26:02.373
I am going to die sooner
rather than later.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.808
You talk to anybody other it?

26:08.810 --> 26:09.643
Your father.

26:11.530 --> 26:12.798
Did he say anything?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.668
Your father had qualities.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.763
Emotional support wasn't one of them.

26:20.420 --> 26:22.453
I think, we all have those moments.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.238
What do you mean?

26:25.240 --> 26:27.750
When you're lying there
staring at the ceiling

26:28.760 --> 26:31.628
wondering how it's gonna end.

26:31.630 --> 26:33.068
Is this it?

26:33.070 --> 26:34.720
Is this the beginning of the end?

26:35.960 --> 26:39.493
Or am I thinking that because
I don't know what's next?

26:42.162 --> 26:44.518
Maybe you're the one that
needs to get checked out.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.363
When the end comes, I'll know it.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.038
You seem very sure of yourself.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.590
And I hate it when I'm right.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.568
Is there anything I could do?

26:53.570 --> 26:55.235
- No.
- Can I do anything for you?

26:55.237 --> 26:57.888
No, I'm pretty wiped
out after these things,

26:57.890 --> 26:59.190
and I just wanna lay down.

27:02.290 --> 27:03.123
Can you?

27:04.110 --> 27:06.298
Can you?

27:06.300 --> 27:07.133
What?

27:08.001 --> 27:10.178
The medicine they give me.

27:10.180 --> 27:13.453
I hate it, and they want me
to take it like every night.

27:14.450 --> 27:15.848
It's supposed to help with the bruising

27:15.850 --> 27:18.978
and the clotting and
staving off infection.

27:18.980 --> 27:19.811
That's good.

27:19.813 --> 27:22.130
No, it makes me sweat
like a whore in church.

27:23.900 --> 27:25.238
My sheets.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.123
Say no more.

27:27.350 --> 27:28.848
Please.

27:28.850 --> 27:30.858
It'll just be a few more days.

27:30.860 --> 27:33.008
I will text you the house number,

27:33.010 --> 27:35.403
and you could forward all calls there.

27:37.450 --> 27:38.500
Thank you, Stephanie.

27:39.670 --> 27:40.828
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:40.830 --> 27:41.898
Hi, again.

27:41.900 --> 27:42.868
You're still at it.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.913
Well, yeah.

27:46.030 --> 27:48.798
She has this lucky pair of socks now,

27:48.800 --> 27:51.468
and she has to wear them every
time she has a math test.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.513
She has a math test tomorrow, so.

27:54.670 --> 27:57.418
I use to have an owl shirt that I loved.

27:57.420 --> 27:58.970
First thing I wore out
of the wash every time.

27:58.972 --> 28:01.028
So you understand the gravity

28:01.030 --> 28:02.928
of this situation.

28:02.930 --> 28:04.978
Kids are so weird.

28:04.980 --> 28:06.083
I was 27.

28:16.990 --> 28:18.063
Mrs. Sloan?

28:18.970 --> 28:22.218
Mrs. Sloan, this man
was using that machine.

28:22.220 --> 28:23.808
Doesn't look like it.

28:23.810 --> 28:26.258
He's standing in front
of it with laundry.

28:26.260 --> 28:27.660
What else would he be doing?

28:28.730 --> 28:30.788
Maybe he was taking his
clothes out of the machine?

28:30.790 --> 28:31.623
He's not.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.688
Do you even live here?

28:34.690 --> 28:36.208
He's helping Frank.

28:36.210 --> 28:37.051
Do you know Frank?

28:37.053 --> 28:38.108
He's on the fourth floor.

28:38.110 --> 28:40.258
He's really, really sick.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.708
He's helping him out
he's doing his laundry.

28:41.710 --> 28:44.098
Isn't that so nice, you know,

28:44.100 --> 28:47.453
people helping people, love thy neighbor?

28:48.730 --> 28:53.063
Community building that's
what it's all about, right?

28:58.350 --> 28:59.198
We are the world.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.048
We are the children.

29:00.050 --> 29:01.863
Bye, Mrs. Sloan, have a great day.

29:05.090 --> 29:07.918
Thank you for saving me
from the sweet looking lady.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.298
Oh, no problem.

29:09.300 --> 29:12.228
Mrs. Sloan has just
approved of my existence

29:12.230 --> 29:13.591
ever since the single mother moved in

29:13.593 --> 29:16.598
with a slightly loud little girl.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.178
I kind of feel like if you can't play

29:18.180 --> 29:20.101
off the level of contempt she has for me,

29:20.103 --> 29:22.623
then I'm sort of missing
a comedic opportunity.

29:26.910 --> 29:28.541
I'm trying to be nice to Frank

29:28.543 --> 29:31.298
because I'm straying from my usual path.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.463
Oh, what's your usual path?

29:35.130 --> 29:36.808
You ever do anyone else's laundry?

29:36.810 --> 29:39.553
Are you kidding me, like
one T-shirt in here is mine.

29:43.340 --> 29:44.548
What's he doing now?

29:44.550 --> 29:45.766
Frank?

29:45.768 --> 29:47.118
- Mm-hmm.
- He's sleeping.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.048
You have somewhere to
be while you're waiting?

29:51.050 --> 29:51.883
No.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.418
Well, do you wanna
come up while you wait?

29:56.420 --> 29:58.808
I don't wanna be a bother.

29:58.810 --> 29:59.660
Okay.

30:02.192 --> 30:03.786
It's not trouble?

30:03.788 --> 30:04.619
No.

30:04.621 --> 30:05.452
No, it's really no trouble at all.

30:05.454 --> 30:08.428
I mean, I don't know how much
stuff I have in the house.

30:08.430 --> 30:11.100
But I have coffee, a nice
collection of herbal teas.

30:12.074 --> 30:14.747
I don't have anything stronger, I'm sorry.

30:14.749 --> 30:17.028
I don't really drink anything stronger.

30:17.030 --> 30:18.538
Oh, you know what though.

30:18.540 --> 30:21.551
I have just the thing to
soothe the weary soul.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.899
I can't get it to.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.298
You are very good at this.

30:31.300 --> 30:34.068
Yeah, well, there's a
real learning curve here.

30:34.070 --> 30:36.988
I mean, I think, that if
you stopped Donkey Kong,

30:36.990 --> 30:38.990
you could be a very formidable opponent.

30:41.090 --> 30:42.718
I like the snack table.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.668
I haven't seen one of those in ages.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.448
We haven't eaten dinner
in our actual kitchen table

30:46.450 --> 30:49.713
in like 10 days.

30:50.676 --> 30:51.808
Do you wanna go again?

30:51.810 --> 30:52.723
Sure.

30:57.130 --> 30:58.168
Why is that?

30:58.170 --> 30:59.081
What?

30:59.083 --> 31:01.458
Why don't you eat at the table?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.538
She's gotten really
into Monopoly recently,

31:03.540 --> 31:08.540
so the table is covered in
this huge sprawling game

31:09.720 --> 31:11.793
that we started a week and a half ago.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.848
I admire the commitment.

31:13.850 --> 31:15.528
No, no, no.

31:15.530 --> 31:16.888
It's gotten really out of hand.

31:16.890 --> 31:18.478
We don't know whose money is who's.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.408
We don't even know
whose property is who's.

31:21.410 --> 31:24.038
It's really more about
keeping the game alive

31:24.040 --> 31:27.439
at this point than pursuing victory.

31:27.441 --> 31:28.538
That seems to run counter to the whole

31:28.540 --> 31:30.148
capitalist spirit of the thing.

31:30.150 --> 31:32.178
Yeah, well, she's seven.

31:32.180 --> 31:34.358
She likes the different
colors of the money.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.193
Right, right.

31:40.020 --> 31:41.768
So do you live around here?

31:41.770 --> 31:43.418
Not far.

31:43.420 --> 31:46.328
How come I've never
seen you around before?

31:46.330 --> 31:47.880
I haven't been around before.

31:49.290 --> 31:50.123
Oh.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.378
- Actually...
- No, no it's fine.

31:52.380 --> 31:54.648
I really didn't wanna pry.

31:54.650 --> 31:57.618
Doesn't feel like prying
if we don't make eye contact.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.098
Okay.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.750
It's kind of like confession,
like a kid in church.

32:03.170 --> 32:06.983
Not quite comfortable with
where that puts me, but okay.

32:10.460 --> 32:11.753
So you're around now.

32:13.940 --> 32:17.339
I haven't seen my family in years.

32:17.341 --> 32:20.241
Then I got the call that my
father died, and now I'm here.

32:21.490 --> 32:23.221
Helping your uncle.

32:23.223 --> 32:25.398
Well, my father was the
only one there for him,

32:25.400 --> 32:28.458
and I don't think there's any other names

32:28.460 --> 32:30.335
on that list after mine.

32:36.260 --> 32:39.513
How long had it been
since you were last around?

32:41.040 --> 32:42.013
Seven years.

32:43.110 --> 32:45.423
No, eight years.

32:47.970 --> 32:48.803
I'm sorry.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.403
We were not close.

32:53.890 --> 32:56.783
Well, fathers can be challenging.

32:59.590 --> 33:02.440
I hear some fathers are nice
to watch a ball game with.

33:03.550 --> 33:04.888
Or go fishing.

33:04.890 --> 33:07.088
Sometimes I like to think that he and I

33:07.090 --> 33:11.113
didn't have enough time to
find the thing, our thing.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.988
Definitely didn't know
the last time I saw him

33:14.990 --> 33:16.623
would be the last time I'd see him.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.007
I thought you guys
didn't play this without me.

33:21.009 --> 33:22.568
I'm sorry.

33:22.570 --> 33:23.401
I know.

33:23.403 --> 33:26.063
I know, I promise this was
just the one exception.

33:27.410 --> 33:28.348
Hi.

33:28.350 --> 33:29.181
- Hi.
- I heard

33:29.183 --> 33:31.108
you play violin the other day.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.463
Can I take your picture?

33:33.470 --> 33:34.303
Sure.

33:36.288 --> 33:37.537
My parents got her this camera

33:37.539 --> 33:39.258
for her birthday last
month and she's obsessed.

33:39.260 --> 33:41.688
She wants to take everyone's picture.

33:41.690 --> 33:44.008
My mom got me a telescope
when I was her age.

33:44.010 --> 33:45.671
I used to ask all the
adults to look through it

33:45.673 --> 33:47.138
and tell me what they saw.

33:47.140 --> 33:48.048
- Really?
- Yeah, it turns out

33:48.050 --> 33:50.888
adults don't really know
anything about constellations.

33:50.890 --> 33:53.090
So there was a lot of
awkward conversations.

33:54.050 --> 33:55.868
Did the telescope eventually go away?

33:55.870 --> 33:56.701
Tell me it went away.

33:56.703 --> 33:58.378
I'm like really on the brink of

33:58.380 --> 34:01.228
needing this camera to go away.

34:01.230 --> 34:03.748
I used the telescope
every day for years.

34:03.750 --> 34:04.583
Great.

34:05.530 --> 34:07.028
There she is.

34:07.030 --> 34:09.753
Do I say cheese?

34:11.570 --> 34:12.583
Act natural.

34:13.420 --> 34:14.678
How?

34:14.679 --> 34:15.513
So.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.353
Just like act natural.

34:21.820 --> 34:24.138
Act like you normally would every day.

34:24.139 --> 34:24.973
I'm trying.

34:29.540 --> 34:30.639
This is nerve-racking.

34:33.389 --> 34:34.507
Is that it?

34:34.510 --> 34:36.078
No, that was just her turning it on.

34:36.080 --> 34:36.913
Did you do it?

34:46.290 --> 34:47.668
Thank you for inviting me in.

34:47.670 --> 34:48.888
Yeah, of course.

34:48.889 --> 34:50.342
Hey, how's he doing?

34:51.659 --> 34:52.510
I have no idea.

34:53.679 --> 34:56.148
Okay, well, anytime you
ever need to kill time,

34:56.150 --> 34:57.338
just knock on the door.

34:57.340 --> 34:58.948
We're usually here.

34:58.950 --> 34:59.783
Thank you.

35:00.910 --> 35:03.058
I'm Peter by the way.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.458
I'm Melanie, hi.

35:04.460 --> 35:05.790
Hi, Melanie.

35:05.792 --> 35:07.861
- And that is?
- That's Mia.

35:07.863 --> 35:08.978
- Mia.
- Mm-hmm.

35:08.980 --> 35:11.381
It was nice to meet both of you.

35:11.383 --> 35:12.216
You too.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.028
Hey, did they
call that prescription in

35:26.030 --> 35:27.533
for me from the office?

35:28.950 --> 35:29.781
I think so.

35:29.783 --> 35:31.273
You think so.

35:32.159 --> 35:34.173
You know what thought did?

35:34.175 --> 35:35.048
What?

35:35.050 --> 35:37.768
He shot his pants but
only thought he did.

35:37.770 --> 35:39.097
I don't know what that means.

35:39.099 --> 35:41.999
My mother used to
say that to me all the time.

35:42.850 --> 35:44.668
You never met her, did you?

35:44.670 --> 35:45.732
No.

35:45.734 --> 35:47.988
I was probably for the best.

35:47.990 --> 35:48.950
What is that?

35:50.593 --> 35:52.243
That is a picture of me.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.618
- What?
- I was about to ask you

35:57.620 --> 35:58.698
a question then I realized

35:58.700 --> 36:00.848
I should probably know the answer already.

36:00.850 --> 36:02.298
What do you mean?

36:02.300 --> 36:06.788
Did you ever have a family, kids, wife?

36:06.790 --> 36:07.623
Nah.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.368
No kids, thank God.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.283
Could you imagine?

36:14.010 --> 36:15.148
I was married once?

36:15.150 --> 36:15.981
Really?

36:15.983 --> 36:17.323
Yeah, two years.

36:18.990 --> 36:22.483
I met her overseas and
brought her back here.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.518
God she hated it here.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.578
Never should've happened.

36:26.580 --> 36:28.413
I was a kid it was stupid.

36:29.730 --> 36:34.178
This was years and years ago

36:34.180 --> 36:36.478
right after your mother
and father got married

36:36.480 --> 36:37.578
before you were born.

36:37.580 --> 36:39.448
But nothing after that?

36:39.450 --> 36:40.283
Nah.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.698
I make the most sense alone.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.443
Your father did too, to be honest.

36:46.810 --> 36:49.610
What do you expect we were
practically raised by wolves.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.428
I don't remember our old
man saying two words to us.

36:53.430 --> 36:54.930
That's the God's honest truth.

36:56.880 --> 37:01.623
Nah, alone, kid, just the way I came in.

38:06.940 --> 38:08.213
- Hi.
- Hey, Melanie.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.429
Are you free for dinner tonight?

38:11.431 --> 38:13.348
Is it a sinner?

38:13.350 --> 38:14.348
Yes.

38:14.350 --> 38:15.638
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.471
Don't be sorry.

38:16.473 --> 38:18.368
Alright, I got five more questions.

38:18.370 --> 38:20.218
She's making her communion
so she has all these

38:20.220 --> 38:22.168
little assignments it's like a whole.

38:22.170 --> 38:25.143
Hold on M-O-R-T-A-L.

38:28.650 --> 38:30.000
I just have to make a call.

38:30.890 --> 38:33.558
Can you wait until I put
her to bed, like 8:15?

38:33.560 --> 38:34.758
- Yeah.
- Cool.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.088
So I'll meet you out front at 8:15.

38:37.090 --> 38:37.921
- M-O-R.
- Yeah.

38:37.923 --> 38:40.188
- Wait.
- T-A-L.

38:40.190 --> 38:42.218
You have serious work to do.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.058
- Thanks.
- What's purgatory?

38:44.060 --> 38:44.893
Good luck.

39:02.350 --> 39:03.438
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.263
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- No trouble.

39:06.780 --> 39:07.698
You okay?

39:07.700 --> 39:10.238
Yeah, you look great.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.898
Thanks.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.578
So where are we going?

39:13.580 --> 39:15.868
What if I told you that I
don't know any restaurants

39:15.870 --> 39:18.718
in the area except for horrible Chinese?

39:18.720 --> 39:20.588
I would say that I don't
go to any restaurants

39:20.590 --> 39:23.258
that don't have crayons on the table.

39:23.260 --> 39:26.113
What can go wrong?

39:26.115 --> 39:28.148
Alright, we'll figure it out.

39:28.150 --> 39:28.983
Thank you.

39:38.372 --> 39:39.288
Is your chair okay?

39:39.290 --> 39:41.013
Yeah, it's just.

39:42.263 --> 39:43.643
- It's okay.
- Wobbly?

39:44.620 --> 39:46.638
No, they didn't put it.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.368
The table's at a weird.

39:48.370 --> 39:49.203
It's okay.

39:59.760 --> 40:04.472
So, what do you do when
you're not doing laundry?

40:07.430 --> 40:08.788
This is always a crowd pleaser.

40:08.790 --> 40:09.863
Alright, here we go.

40:10.800 --> 40:14.628
I do telemarketing for
web and SEO services.

40:14.630 --> 40:17.808
You call strangers and
sell them web services?

40:17.810 --> 40:21.333
Yes, is the only accurate
answer to that question.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.288
How would you get interested in that?

40:24.290 --> 40:25.148
I'm not.

40:25.150 --> 40:26.865
I'm really not interested in that.

40:26.867 --> 40:30.368
I mean I don't think anyone who
does it is interested in it.

40:30.370 --> 40:31.998
Basically, it's just a job.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.913
I needed a job when Mia was born.

40:35.936 --> 40:37.278
I wanted to work from home.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.408
I couldn't really bear
the thought of leaving

40:40.410 --> 40:43.168
and leaving her with someone
and getting a regular job.

40:43.170 --> 40:47.748
So, I got this one and then
I was there for a year.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.943
And then that became two years.

40:52.680 --> 40:56.188
Yeah, they do let me pick my own hours.

40:56.190 --> 40:57.940
They pay for my phone and internet.

40:59.140 --> 41:01.308
Basically, I sold myself
to a huge corporation

41:01.310 --> 41:04.103
for the price of a laptop
and a phone to plug in.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.808
Everyone does that.

41:07.810 --> 41:08.908
Yeah.

41:08.910 --> 41:10.558
You're making it work.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.393
Yeah.

41:12.620 --> 41:13.481
Yeah, I don't know.

41:13.483 --> 41:15.773
I mean, hope I end up somewhere better.

41:18.520 --> 41:21.508
I keep thinking it'll get
easier as she gets older.

41:21.510 --> 41:23.693
But, she's seven.

41:25.500 --> 41:26.858
What'd you do before her?

41:26.860 --> 41:27.868
Nothing.

41:27.870 --> 41:28.808
Nothing, I didn't do anything.

41:28.810 --> 41:30.168
Well, I was in school.

41:30.170 --> 41:31.143
I was a student.

41:32.360 --> 41:35.148
I did have a part-time job
folding sweaters at the Gap.

41:35.150 --> 41:36.908
- Ooh.
- Yeah, wow.

41:36.910 --> 41:38.848
This was not the plan.

41:38.850 --> 41:39.850
What was the plan?

41:40.780 --> 41:43.308
I wanted to be an art teacher.

41:43.310 --> 41:45.118
I always thought that seemed cool.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.770
You could still do that, right?

41:47.610 --> 41:48.618
Yeah.

41:48.620 --> 41:51.508
Technically, yeah, I would
need a lot more credits.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.758
So the idea of going back to school,

41:53.760 --> 41:55.908
but also having a job
so I can pay the rent

41:55.910 --> 42:00.148
and keep the lights on
it doesn't seem possible

42:00.150 --> 42:01.400
at this point in my life.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.688
She seems awesome?

42:04.690 --> 42:05.978
Mia, yeah?

42:05.980 --> 42:06.811
Yeah.

42:06.813 --> 42:08.808
She is a lot.

42:08.810 --> 42:10.051
She's a lot all the time.

42:10.053 --> 42:14.028
She kind of just like throws
everything at you all at once.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.508
I mean, she asks me.

42:15.510 --> 42:18.143
The questions that she asks me.

42:22.590 --> 42:26.518
I would actually not like
to talk about Mia tonight

42:26.520 --> 42:28.278
if that's okay?

42:28.280 --> 42:31.648
I just spend basically all
my time thinking about her

42:31.650 --> 42:33.078
and making decisions for her

42:33.080 --> 42:34.518
and then questioning the decision

42:34.520 --> 42:37.248
and beating myself up
over every little thing

42:37.250 --> 42:39.473
- about her, so.
- No, Mia.

42:39.475 --> 42:41.007
- Understood.
- Yeah, thank you.

42:41.009 --> 42:41.840
Thanks.

42:46.004 --> 42:47.188
You already had a question about her.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.838
- Right?
- No, it's okay.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.148
Go ahead.

42:50.150 --> 42:52.598
- You wanna know if...
- She has a father?

42:52.600 --> 42:53.808
Yeah.

42:53.810 --> 42:54.915
Is that always the question?

42:54.917 --> 42:56.750
Always the question.

42:58.420 --> 42:59.828
So, yes.

42:59.830 --> 43:02.573
Obviously, Mia has a father, right.

43:03.810 --> 43:05.788
She wouldn't like recognize him.

43:05.790 --> 43:07.168
If she ran into him on the street,

43:07.170 --> 43:08.268
he would not recognize her.

43:08.270 --> 43:09.568
They've never met.

43:09.570 --> 43:13.028
He left before she was
born, which sounds awful.

43:13.030 --> 43:15.168
But really, I mean, it's not like he said

43:15.170 --> 43:17.718
he was going out for milk
and then never came back.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.248
He ended it face to face.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.283
He was as humane as you can be.

43:22.580 --> 43:24.178
It was rough at the time.

43:24.180 --> 43:25.638
But it's been seven years,

43:25.640 --> 43:27.538
and I've lived every
single day without him.

43:27.540 --> 43:31.808
And I can very safely say
that he made the right call.

43:31.810 --> 43:34.008
For him, yes, probably.

43:34.010 --> 43:36.118
For us, definitely.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.948
I mean, I don't think
it would've made sense

43:37.950 --> 43:40.608
or been good for Mia if
we had just kind of like

43:40.610 --> 43:43.953
stayed together and pretended
like that was the plan.

43:46.950 --> 43:48.578
I'm sorry, this is a lot.

43:48.580 --> 43:49.928
No, it's okay.

43:49.930 --> 43:52.338
I just wanted
to at least get to desert

43:52.340 --> 43:54.328
before giving you my sob story.

43:54.330 --> 43:55.930
I don't mind listening to you.

43:56.790 --> 43:59.563
I'm glad you don't mind listening to me.

44:08.690 --> 44:12.148
Listen, I'm feeling a little
exposed to be honest with you.

44:12.150 --> 44:15.788
I feel like I just gave you
all my emotional baggage

44:15.790 --> 44:18.768
all that once and I don't
know anything about you.

44:18.770 --> 44:21.005
Can you just even if it out.

44:21.007 --> 44:22.148
I don't really have anything.

44:22.150 --> 44:22.981
Just something weird,

44:22.983 --> 44:25.588
something weird about you
or something embarrassing.

44:25.590 --> 44:27.173
- Anything.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:27.175 --> 44:28.046
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:28.048 --> 44:28.881
Great.

44:36.621 --> 44:38.448
When I take a shower,

44:38.450 --> 44:40.323
I usually wash my face last.

44:41.670 --> 44:45.028
Sometimes I get so caught
up in my train of thought,

44:45.030 --> 44:47.328
whatever I'm thinking
about, that I don't remember

44:47.330 --> 44:49.668
if I washed my face yet or not.

44:49.670 --> 44:53.058
So I'll stand there,
water beading down on me

44:53.060 --> 44:57.868
for five whole minutes,
debating with myself

44:57.870 --> 45:01.408
whether or not I should wash my face again

45:01.410 --> 45:03.998
if I hadn't, in fact, washed it before

45:04.000 --> 45:06.788
or if I should get out of the shower

45:06.790 --> 45:08.597
not having washed my face at all.

45:12.746 --> 45:14.999
That was the worst.

45:15.001 --> 45:18.496
That was the worst.

45:18.498 --> 45:19.329
That was the worst.

45:19.331 --> 45:22.518
Yeah, I just bared my soul to you.

45:22.520 --> 45:25.208
I just told you about
raising a kid on my own

45:25.210 --> 45:30.210
and about my thwarted dreams
of being an art teacher.

45:31.970 --> 45:35.068
You are telling me about washing your face

45:35.070 --> 45:37.543
or not washing your face in the shower.

45:39.270 --> 45:41.263
It's not my fault you went first.

45:44.086 --> 45:46.998
How did you know that's so weird.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.918
So, when do you sleep usually?

45:49.920 --> 45:51.573
I don't usually.

45:53.230 --> 45:54.658
Do you wanna hear the routine?

45:54.660 --> 45:55.573
- Yes.
- Okay.

45:57.460 --> 46:00.686
I get Mia off to school at 7:45.

46:00.688 --> 46:02.288
I get a couple of hours in then.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.758
Then I do the phone for a couple hours.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.338
Then I'll do some housework or whatever

46:09.340 --> 46:10.758
until she gets back, and then she's back.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.598
So we do her homework.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.648
We watch a TV show together.

46:13.650 --> 46:17.628
We eat dinner, bath,
story, bedtime routine.

46:17.630 --> 46:18.668
Get her off to bed.

46:18.670 --> 46:21.768
Put my little headset
on that's for dialing.

46:21.770 --> 46:23.501
I'll try to squeeze in a
couple more hours of sleep then

46:23.503 --> 46:27.023
because she wakes up for
breakfast hit or mess.

46:27.878 --> 46:28.723
- Wow.
- Yeah.

46:29.730 --> 46:32.498
I know, I've moved
further and further away

46:32.500 --> 46:35.548
from any kind of normal routine
the longer I've done this.

46:35.550 --> 46:36.728
You're doing it.

46:36.730 --> 46:38.373
You're on your terms together.

46:40.180 --> 46:41.780
Yeah, I don't know.

46:44.170 --> 46:48.208
I wish I could say that this
was all some conscience act

46:48.210 --> 46:53.118
of defiance to choose to live
outside the mainstream thing.

46:53.120 --> 46:56.443
Whatever, but this is just the job I have.

46:57.337 --> 46:59.037
Most of the time I'm on autopilot.

47:00.220 --> 47:01.738
You're on a different level.

47:01.740 --> 47:03.828
You're making decisions
for another person.

47:03.830 --> 47:05.128
I don't even make decisions.

47:05.130 --> 47:07.468
I'm just carrying out actions,

47:07.470 --> 47:10.238
muscle memory: eat, sleep, work,

47:10.240 --> 47:13.263
that shower thing I told you about.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.158
No one tells me to do anything.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.783
But, what am I doing?

47:20.420 --> 47:21.273
I'm impressed.

47:22.835 --> 47:24.933
Believe me, I make it look very hard.

47:27.860 --> 47:32.238
I make enough to pay
rent to keep our place,

47:32.240 --> 47:34.668
and then my parents pay her
tuition at Catholic school.

47:34.670 --> 47:38.116
And once a year they'll take
us on a little vacation.

47:38.118 --> 47:39.458
That sounds nice.

47:39.460 --> 47:40.698
Yeah.

47:40.700 --> 47:42.000
Yeah, it actually is nice.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.658
Most of the time I'm able to look past how

47:45.660 --> 47:48.443
disappointing the state of
affairs is for all of us.

47:49.723 --> 47:52.478
We did not envision this as our set up.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.688
Your daughter has people who love her.

47:54.690 --> 47:56.240
Someone's always there for her.

47:57.310 --> 47:58.143
Yeah.

47:59.300 --> 48:00.648
A lot of nights though I end up

48:00.650 --> 48:04.328
just wide awake watching shitty TV

48:04.330 --> 48:09.330
or staring at my computer
screen or whatever.

48:09.580 --> 48:14.493
I find 3:00 to 5:00 a.m.
to be a difficult time.

48:16.640 --> 48:18.240
I'm back at my father's house.

48:19.420 --> 48:21.868
I'm sleeping in my childhood bedroom.

48:21.870 --> 48:22.703
It's creepy.

48:24.490 --> 48:25.940
I can't seem to get to sleep.

48:26.850 --> 48:28.750
But for some reason I keep going back.

48:30.540 --> 48:32.088
You grew up here?

48:32.090 --> 48:33.363
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

48:34.840 --> 48:35.983
And I moved.

48:37.946 --> 48:39.748
And?

48:39.750 --> 48:43.843
And, my mother died when I was nine.

48:45.020 --> 48:46.570
So it was just my father and I.

48:48.020 --> 48:50.048
We'd see Uncle Frank
on holidays sometimes,

48:50.050 --> 48:52.750
but for the most part it was
just me and David Steele.

48:53.980 --> 48:55.678
He pretended to keep
it together pretty well

48:55.680 --> 48:56.963
until I was about 11.

48:58.787 --> 49:01.168
It wasn't happy, but it wasn't bad.

49:01.170 --> 49:02.908
We greeted each other.

49:02.910 --> 49:04.913
We exchanged pleasantries.

49:06.780 --> 49:08.058
When I think about it now,

49:08.060 --> 49:09.568
I shouldn't have taken it personally

49:09.570 --> 49:13.678
because he was just
dealing with everything,

49:13.680 --> 49:16.853
this new world without
her, as best that he could.

49:18.150 --> 49:18.983
But I did.

49:20.247 --> 49:21.297
I took it personally.

49:22.300 --> 49:25.658
When I was 13, we openly
acknowledged the fact that

49:25.660 --> 49:27.128
the house was a miserable place to be

49:27.130 --> 49:28.568
especially when we were both there,

49:28.570 --> 49:31.208
and so he instituted a new rule.

49:31.210 --> 49:33.295
You don't have to come home on Fridays.

49:33.297 --> 49:36.578
"In fact, don't come home on Fridays"

49:36.580 --> 49:37.588
that's how he said it.

49:37.590 --> 49:41.813
And it seemed like a
good idea at the time.

49:42.792 --> 49:45.023
You know, we both were looking
for something like that.

49:45.960 --> 49:48.858
So, I had this one friend,
this one good friend,

49:48.860 --> 49:52.758
this one friend, Matt Rockcamp.

49:52.760 --> 49:55.858
We were the tech guys in the school play.

49:55.860 --> 49:57.388
We'd do the soundboard and the line board

49:57.390 --> 49:58.540
and all those switches.

49:59.690 --> 50:03.738
And we had play rehearsals
on Saturday mornings.

50:03.740 --> 50:05.863
So Friday like clockwork,

50:07.020 --> 50:08.870
we'd go to Matt's house after school.

50:09.720 --> 50:14.720
We'd watch Monty Python
movies and order pizza

50:14.790 --> 50:17.698
and sometimes we'd sleep
on the screened in porch

50:17.700 --> 50:18.533
that he had.

50:19.370 --> 50:22.088
In the morning, Mrs. R
would wake up and make us

50:22.090 --> 50:26.073
bacon and eggs and these
homemade cinnamon rolls,

50:26.940 --> 50:28.898
not even from the can.

50:28.900 --> 50:31.433
You could put on all the icing you wanted.

50:33.160 --> 50:35.728
When I have any fun inkling of that age,

50:35.730 --> 50:36.880
that's what I think of.

50:38.153 --> 50:40.608
But, of course, the
worse is when I went home

50:40.610 --> 50:42.013
after play practice.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.740
My father would smoke these cigars

50:47.650 --> 50:51.143
and always have the TV glaring
like four bars too loud.

50:52.660 --> 50:54.418
I remember getting in the front door

50:54.420 --> 50:57.218
and catching that smell and hearing the TV

50:57.220 --> 50:59.423
and just being so sad
that I was back home.

51:01.456 --> 51:03.118
Then the only thing
that was actually worse

51:03.120 --> 51:05.220
was when I'd get home and he wasn't there.

51:06.240 --> 51:07.808
And then Saturdays turn into Sundays.

51:07.810 --> 51:09.798
And Sundays turned into Wednesdays.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.083
And he was gone more and more.

51:16.810 --> 51:20.203
Now Frank is dying of cancer.

51:21.840 --> 51:26.683
And Matt Rockcamp I heard
that he moved to Seattle,

51:27.680 --> 51:28.980
and he's an architect now.

51:34.466 --> 51:35.668
I think, you're doing a really good job

51:35.670 --> 51:36.770
with that little girl.

51:43.260 --> 51:44.845
I can't believe you
told me that shower story

51:44.847 --> 51:49.847
while you were sitting on that.

51:52.483 --> 51:53.988
This was fun.

51:53.990 --> 51:55.298
Yeah, thank you for coming out.

51:55.300 --> 51:57.608
Oh, my god, thank
you are you kidding me.

51:57.610 --> 52:00.588
I never have a reason to actually leave

52:00.590 --> 52:01.790
this apartment building.

52:03.840 --> 52:06.551
I like invent reasons
to leave the building.

52:06.553 --> 52:10.148
I go to the store, get
something I already have,

52:10.150 --> 52:13.143
or go to the Post Office for new stamps.

52:15.744 --> 52:17.128
I don't know I take Mia to the park.

52:17.130 --> 52:19.373
She doesn't even like
going to the park anymore.

52:20.290 --> 52:22.470
I'd go to the park.

52:22.472 --> 52:24.188
It's a little late,
but maybe another time.

52:24.190 --> 52:25.023
Yeah.

52:34.426 --> 52:36.288
So I can't invite you up.

52:36.290 --> 52:37.690
I'm not gonna invite you up.

52:39.080 --> 52:40.518
- No.
- Sorry to just say that.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.958
I just wanted to be direct

52:42.960 --> 52:45.248
because I feel like Mia's upstairs,

52:45.250 --> 52:48.751
and if she were to hear us come in.

52:48.753 --> 52:50.734
She'd get the wrong idea.

52:50.736 --> 52:52.168
You don't want her to bring

52:52.170 --> 52:53.308
strange men into the apartment.

52:53.310 --> 52:56.048
Questions, I don't wanna
deal with her questions.

52:56.050 --> 52:57.628
Yeah.

52:57.630 --> 52:58.463
Okay.

53:00.010 --> 53:02.578
I'm gonna head home and get some sleep

53:02.580 --> 53:05.758
before I have to drive
Frank in the morning.

53:05.760 --> 53:06.873
Okay, rest up.

53:07.819 --> 53:08.918
I will.

53:08.920 --> 53:11.728
Stop by tomorrow if you
want after the doctor.

53:11.730 --> 53:13.597
- Goodnight.
- Thank you.

53:13.599 --> 53:14.432
Goodnight.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.688
So was how was treatment today?

53:41.690 --> 53:43.497
What did they tell you about me?

53:43.499 --> 53:44.588
Nothing.

53:44.590 --> 53:45.788
Don't play dumb with me.

53:45.790 --> 53:47.508
What did they tell you about me?

53:47.510 --> 53:49.288
They asked me again if you
were taking your medication

53:49.290 --> 53:50.198
and how you diet went.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.788
What are you gonna
want a stool sample next?

53:51.790 --> 53:53.228
I didn't say anything.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.835
You know, I've lived
my life on my terms,

53:54.837 --> 53:56.968
and I'll see it end on my term.

53:56.970 --> 53:57.998
Okay.

53:58.000 --> 53:58.833
It is okay.

54:01.250 --> 54:02.968
Why won't you at least try?

54:02.970 --> 54:05.958
You know, your father never
gave me shit about this.

54:05.960 --> 54:07.368
He did it the right way.

54:07.370 --> 54:10.248
No pain, no suffering, no
lingering in the hospital.

54:10.250 --> 54:11.878
Just enough Scotch to
make the lines blurry.

54:11.880 --> 54:13.114
The tree does the rest.

54:13.116 --> 54:14.202
What?

54:14.204 --> 54:15.348
Nothing.

54:15.350 --> 54:17.208
You don't know how long
I've been doing this?

54:17.210 --> 54:19.438
How many doctors, how many treatments.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.778
I get bent out of shape
over every instruction,

54:21.780 --> 54:24.438
and then what the hell
am I supposed to do.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.068
I listened.

54:26.070 --> 54:28.988
For a long time I listened.

54:28.990 --> 54:30.868
I just can't.

54:30.870 --> 54:33.273
I just can't listen anymore,

54:35.130 --> 54:37.488
and I would kindly ask
you to respect that.

54:37.490 --> 54:40.403
When I don't even care enough
at this point to do that.

54:56.550 --> 54:57.748
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:57.750 --> 54:59.448
I didn't know you were here.

54:59.450 --> 55:00.283
Come in.

55:01.440 --> 55:02.818
What's up?

55:02.820 --> 55:04.248
My father's house?

55:04.250 --> 55:05.150
Would you want it?

55:07.020 --> 55:08.378
Are you kidding?

55:08.380 --> 55:10.618
No, maybe it would help.

55:10.620 --> 55:12.224
Peter, I can't afford a house.

55:12.226 --> 55:14.023
What if you didn't
have to worry about that?

55:17.400 --> 55:20.108
Okay, there's a light
switch outside my bathroom.

55:20.110 --> 55:22.458
It's like one of those
pull light switches,

55:22.460 --> 55:23.658
and it broke months ago.

55:23.660 --> 55:25.488
And I just leave the light on.

55:25.490 --> 55:26.903
All the time it's always on.

55:29.031 --> 55:31.988
So I can't take care of a whole house.

55:31.990 --> 55:33.488
And also Mia's in school,

55:33.490 --> 55:35.183
so we can't just like move.

55:36.480 --> 55:37.998
Of course.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.941
Of course, you're right I'm sorry.

55:39.943 --> 55:41.468
Are you okay?

55:41.470 --> 55:43.268
I should probably go.

55:43.270 --> 55:44.880
I'm sorry to bother you.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.978
I was knocking for like 15 minutes.

56:30.980 --> 56:31.878
I was wondering where you were.

56:31.880 --> 56:33.688
I thought maybe, huh?

56:33.690 --> 56:34.523
I was dead?

56:35.410 --> 56:37.343
Getting ready to turn
it over with this, kid.

56:38.810 --> 56:40.153
Come on we gotta get going.

56:40.990 --> 56:41.872
- Pass.
- What the hell do

56:41.874 --> 56:43.081
did you do in here, Frank?

56:43.083 --> 56:44.588
It smells like you took a dump in here.

56:44.590 --> 56:46.093
But you'll never find it.

56:48.810 --> 56:50.238
Hurry up, come on.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.188
Or what?

56:51.190 --> 56:52.828
You're not listening.

56:52.830 --> 56:54.398
I'm not going anywhere today

56:54.400 --> 56:55.808
or any other day for that matter.

56:55.810 --> 56:56.798
You're doing really well, Frank.

56:56.800 --> 56:59.328
No, no you're doing really well.

56:59.330 --> 57:01.638
You got a nice little record
of on-time deliveries,

57:01.640 --> 57:04.661
and I'm sure the doctors are
all so very proud of you.

57:04.663 --> 57:05.788
It's a game.

57:05.790 --> 57:07.498
It's just a game.

57:07.500 --> 57:08.948
I'm not even a player.

57:08.950 --> 57:10.748
I'm a piece, I'm a pawn.

57:10.750 --> 57:12.418
Move him there, move him here.

57:12.420 --> 57:14.508
Give him this, try that.

57:14.510 --> 57:17.641
And I realize I have one move left,

57:17.643 --> 57:19.868
and I choose not to play.

57:19.870 --> 57:21.398
I'm sorry you're not
feeling well, Frank.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.368
Don't you dare.

57:23.370 --> 57:25.428
Don't you dare pity me.

57:25.430 --> 57:27.498
I was dying before you
walked in this house,

57:27.500 --> 57:29.258
and I'll be dying when you walk out.

57:29.260 --> 57:30.998
On your feet we're going, Frank!

57:31.000 --> 57:32.298
Or maybe I'll get lucky.

57:32.300 --> 57:34.523
Or maybe I'll just be dead.

57:36.610 --> 57:38.648
I'm not just gonna sit
here and watch you die.

57:38.650 --> 57:39.788
Then go!

57:39.790 --> 57:40.698
I didn't ask you to come here.

57:40.700 --> 57:43.028
I didn't ask you to take care of me,

57:43.030 --> 57:45.930
and I'm sure as hell not going
to ask for your permission.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.170
Why are you doing this?

57:49.150 --> 57:50.700
I'm not doing it to you, kid.

58:01.313 --> 58:02.258
Peter.

58:02.260 --> 58:04.308
Peter, this is Kevin and Renee.

58:04.310 --> 58:05.798
This is their second look,

58:05.800 --> 58:07.728
and, I think, I'm pretty confident to say

58:07.730 --> 58:10.158
you got serious buyers here.

58:10.160 --> 58:10.993
That's great.

58:12.020 --> 58:14.408
I'm so glad
you popped in, Peter.

58:14.410 --> 58:17.258
They were asking me, but
I'm sure you know better.

58:17.260 --> 58:19.110
How are the schools in this district?

58:21.479 --> 58:23.328
I don't really know.

58:23.330 --> 58:24.513
I have to I'm sorry.

58:36.340 --> 58:38.368
You know what kid you're
really starting to piss me off.

58:38.370 --> 58:39.320
I was at my desk.

58:40.500 --> 58:43.078
I was at the office working on an email

58:43.080 --> 58:45.478
when the phone rings.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.153
The call came in that he had died.

58:48.230 --> 58:51.048
I didn't have an answer to
what it's gonna be again?

58:51.050 --> 58:52.418
One afternoon the phone rings

58:52.420 --> 58:54.683
and that's how I find out it's over.

58:56.314 --> 58:57.508
Come on what you
think that by being here

58:57.510 --> 58:59.108
it's not gonna happen.

58:59.110 --> 59:01.138
You're getting that call, kid.

59:01.140 --> 59:03.308
One way or another
you're getting that call.

59:03.310 --> 59:04.948
I don't want that.

59:04.950 --> 59:06.668
So what are you gonna do
put a mirror under my nose

59:06.670 --> 59:07.920
every time I go to sleep?

59:14.190 --> 59:15.290
Where are you going?

59:16.170 --> 59:17.001
Well, you're here, right?

59:17.003 --> 59:18.663
Take me to the store I need stuff.

59:26.350 --> 59:28.318
Oh, hey, where are boys going?

59:28.320 --> 59:29.153
To the beach.

59:30.093 --> 59:31.331
You wanna come?

59:31.333 --> 59:33.055
Please, mommy, please.

59:33.057 --> 59:36.540
We're gonna eat clams,
french fries, milkshakes.

59:36.542 --> 59:37.554
Please.

59:37.556 --> 59:38.899
You have homework.

59:38.901 --> 59:42.218
Just a little and I take pictures.

59:42.220 --> 59:44.788
A little favor for a dying old man.

59:44.790 --> 59:45.640
Works every time.

59:47.060 --> 59:48.868
I thought you had to
get stuff from the store.

59:48.870 --> 59:50.770
Better opportunity presented itself.

59:52.970 --> 59:54.412
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:54.414 --> 59:55.497
We're here.

59:56.538 --> 59:57.371
You okay?

59:59.108 --> 01:00:00.148
Yes.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:02.858
Mommy, they don't have
my booster seater here.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.263
Yeah, well.

01:00:04.265 --> 01:00:05.878
You're gonna have to make
an exception this time.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.818
They keep these kids in their car seats

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.218
until their wedding night.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.888
When I was kid, we didn't have car seats.

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:13.298
You sat in somebody's lap
with somebody who smoked,

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.308
and they blow that smoke in your face.

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:16.868
If the car hit a bump,
you banged your head.

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:17.991
You turned out just fine.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:20.347
He's just mad at me 'cause I'm dying.

01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:22.211
Mommy, is he really dying?

01:00:22.213 --> 01:00:23.888
That's not such a good question to ask.

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:25.478
Because they don't want
you to hear the truth.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.311
Who's getting hungry?

01:00:26.313 --> 01:00:27.753
- Me.
- Great.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.000
Let's go.

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:37.603
What the heck?

01:00:38.488 --> 01:00:40.275
I'm taking pictures of the ocean.

01:00:40.277 --> 01:00:42.368
Yeah, but why are you taking so many.

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:43.978
It's all the same.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.885
Because I wanna get all of it.

01:00:45.887 --> 01:00:47.883
But you can't
get all of it, it's huge.

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:52.067
Well, maybe I can get most of it.

01:00:53.468 --> 01:00:54.301
Okay.

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:56.388
What do you got there?

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:57.758
- My wallet.
- Oh, yeah.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.998
How much you got?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.628
11 bucks, one five and six ones.

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:03.888
Oh, yeah, let me show you something.

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.323
See, you take your money.

01:01:06.484 --> 01:01:10.048
You take your big bill, your five.

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:12.448
Then you wrap the ones around it.

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:13.555
This way when people see it,

01:01:13.557 --> 01:01:14.905
they think you only got a dollar.

01:01:14.907 --> 01:01:16.728
Otherwise they see a big bill,

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.883
they'd knock you on the
head and they'd take it.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:21.858
Mom, are they really gonna knock me

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.238
in the head for my money?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.337
Thanks, Frank.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:32.873
Thank you.

01:01:35.205 --> 01:01:37.156
Thank you.

01:01:37.158 --> 01:01:38.241
Thank you.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.253
Have a clam.

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:45.580
It's good, huh?

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:48.798
When I was a little boy,

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.408
I use to come here with my brother

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:52.826
and we would dig them out of
the wet sand and eat 'em raw.

01:01:52.828 --> 01:01:54.208
Ew, really?

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.238
Oh, yeah, it's the best way to eat 'em.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.118
One day couple of years ago I was digging,

01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.868
and this bozo comes up to me.

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:02.795
He says, "The fishing rights
on this beach are protected,

01:02:02.797 --> 01:02:04.788
"and you can't do that."

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.085
So I said, "Oh, yeah.

01:02:06.087 --> 01:02:07.158
"I'm a veteran and I"

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.571
Frank.

01:02:08.573 --> 01:02:09.406
Child.

01:02:12.532 --> 01:02:13.398
What did you do?

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.233
I stopped.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.311
Well, that's good.

01:02:16.313 --> 01:02:18.573
You wouldn't wanna get in trouble.

01:02:28.256 --> 01:02:30.918
What's going on with him?

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.768
He didn't go to treatment this morning.

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.570
He said he doesn't wanna go anymore.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.198
Sorry.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.550
Then he told me to leave.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:41.588
So you grabbed him and
brought him to the beach?

01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:43.158
No, I left.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.310
And then you came back.

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:47.668
Okay.

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:48.888
Okay, look, Peter, I know you're

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.628
trying to do something good here.

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:51.718
- I get that.
- Believe me,

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.978
he's said that earlier.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.630
You have to let him choose now,

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:57.158
whether you like it or not.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.435
Why?

01:02:58.437 --> 01:02:59.558
Why does he get to choose?

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.760
Because it's his life.

01:03:02.849 --> 01:03:03.699
He's my family.

01:03:04.671 --> 01:03:06.171
Can I stand idly by and watch?

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.643
I think, it's time maybe for
you to start saying goodbye.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.488
No, no.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.412
No one's asking you to save them.

01:03:16.414 --> 01:03:18.958
Is this about what I
said about the house?

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.283
I mean, sort of.

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:25.638
You come in here and you act
like you wanna save the day.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.378
I mean, to be honest with you
it's a pretty obnoxious idea

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.748
when you really think about it.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:31.653
He is a human being.

01:03:31.655 --> 01:03:32.908
We are human beings.

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:33.743
We have dignity.

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:36.258
We're trying to make the
best of what we have.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.205
We don't need your judgment.

01:03:38.207 --> 01:03:40.078
I never judged you.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.874
I don't judge him.

01:03:41.876 --> 01:03:43.168
But you can't invite me into your lives

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.838
then ask me not to touch anything.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.948
I'm not a child.

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:48.433
I finally have some power, some ability.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.518
- Finally, I can do something.
- Jesus!

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.968
- I could change things.
- Peter, no.

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:54.178
You are not that powerful.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.588
You don't have a magic wand

01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:57.238
that you can just wave in the air

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.253
and make all the bad stuff go away.

01:04:00.177 --> 01:04:02.489
So what do I do?

01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:03.478
Nothing?

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.248
Be careful, okay.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:07.508
Be careful thinking that you
have the answer to something

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.460
that isn't your question to begin with.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.600
Alright, it's time to go.

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:23.708
All right, bye guys.

01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:25.160
Take care of yourself, Frank.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.260
Yeah, that was good.

01:04:48.443 --> 01:04:49.984
I had fun.

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:52.953
I haven't been to the beach
in God knows how long.

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.131
Glad you're happy.

01:04:55.133 --> 01:04:57.983
Yeah, that's where I should go.

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:00.448
You just went.

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:04.578
No, no, that's where
they should bury me.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.438
You know, not bury me.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.678
Scatter me, you know
like when they burn you?

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.703
Cremate?

01:05:10.705 --> 01:05:12.813
Yeah, cremate me.

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:15.393
Cremate me.

01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:17.343
But scatter my ashes on the beach.

01:05:18.709 --> 01:05:21.500
Let old Frank
get lapped up by the ocean

01:05:23.299 --> 01:05:24.799
I would like that.

01:06:58.136 --> 01:07:00.636
Hey, kid, what's up?

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.436
The house sold.

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:07.028
Mm, good, good for you.

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:08.578
You get that money.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:11.348
After bills and such
it's really not that bad.

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:13.008
Well, good, you deserve it.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:15.228
Now put it to good use.

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:16.363
I'll think something.

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.828
I should ask you if you wanted anything

01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:22.088
anything of my father's from the house?

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:24.863
Nah, besides what
would I do with it now?

01:07:29.662 --> 01:07:31.245
I'm sorry, Frank.

01:07:32.113 --> 01:07:33.668
What are you
apologizing to me for?

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:36.263
Well, a lot of things.

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:39.723
Now you don't need to be sorry to me.

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.518
Thanks, Frank.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.903
You're a good kid.

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.680
You go home and get some rest.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.758
Take care of yourself.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.131
You too.

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.216
I'll see you around, kid.

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:37.912
Hey, Peter.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.639
We missed you around here.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.841
It is good to be back.

01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:46.028
We were all thinking about you.

01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:47.029
Thank you.

01:08:47.897 --> 01:08:51.608
You know, it's times like
these you need family the most.

01:08:51.609 --> 01:08:52.777
Definitely.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:54.933
Stephanie.

01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:58.002
How are things?

01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:59.872
Are things okay?

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.473
Yeah.

01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:04.473
Thanks for asking.

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:32.000
Hello, Peter.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.948
Hey, Kid.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:41.368
What's up?

01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:43.343
I got a call from the hospital.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.968
They said you made an appointment,

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:48.728
but you needed your kid to pick you up.

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:51.268
Yeah, I didn't know
how to get a hold of you,

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.318
so I figured the hospital
could track you down.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.223
Your kid?

01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:59.393
I actually said that
kid with the dirty beard.

01:10:00.316 --> 01:10:01.566
You must have changed it.

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:13.624
I don't wanna go just yet.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:14.459
Okay, we can just hang out and then.

01:10:17.343 --> 01:10:18.980
Yeah, that's good.

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:20.623
You okay?

01:10:20.625 --> 01:10:21.723
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:10:23.213 --> 01:10:25.163
Starting to think I did this all wrong.

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:27.624
What do you mean?

01:10:27.626 --> 01:10:28.543
All this.

01:10:29.403 --> 01:10:30.395
I thought I could do this my way.

01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:33.868
You know, when they find my
body in a couple of week,

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:37.123
when the mail piled up and the
stench reached the hallway.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.068
Now I'm thinking that
wasn't such a good idea.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.558
Take a deep breath, Frank.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.475
It's gonna be okay.

01:10:43.477 --> 01:10:44.703
Listen I'm trying.

01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:46.561
It's hard.

01:10:46.563 --> 01:10:48.923
I know, I'm here.

01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.863
Thanks, kid.

01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:00.790
Remember what I told you about
how when the end is coming,

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:03.826
I think, I'll know it?

01:11:07.328 --> 01:11:08.373
And what did I say?

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.178
I hate being right.

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.013
Frank.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.453
I don't know.

01:11:18.334 --> 01:11:19.784
It just hit me the other day.

01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.780
I didn't know what to do,
so I called the hospital.

01:11:26.206 --> 01:11:27.903
I couldn't think of anything else.

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:36.063
Hey.

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:37.743
Frank.

01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:40.233
Frank, look at me.

01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:42.423
Frank.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:46.950
I'm glad they got me.

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.263
Thanks, kid.

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:57.560
Frank Steele.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.788
Want me to go to the
store and get you something?

01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:24.246
No, I just need to.

01:12:24.248 --> 01:12:26.248
I just need to sit down.

01:12:33.761 --> 01:12:36.468
You know what help me up.

01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:37.301
I need to go to bed.

01:12:37.303 --> 01:12:38.783
Okay, I got it.

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:44.278
Can you get me some of that soup

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.043
I like from the place?

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.703
Yeah, I can go and get that.

01:12:50.087 --> 01:12:51.087
But not right now.

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:56.076
I'll wait until you fall asleep.

01:12:56.078 --> 01:12:56.911
Thanks.

01:13:00.832 --> 01:13:03.308
What do you know, kid.

01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:04.463
I guess, I was wrong.

01:13:05.924 --> 01:13:07.928
You just gotta
get some rest, Frank.

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.430
I gotta hand it to you, kid.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.733
Your old man was a rat bastard.

01:13:15.344 --> 01:13:17.173
But you are all right.

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:19.493
You turned out okay.

01:13:21.161 --> 01:13:23.278
You said it yourself.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.480
He should've been alone.

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:27.093
Nah, screw that.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.273
Nobody should be alone.

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:34.050
Anyone who says that it's a cop out.

01:13:36.168 --> 01:13:38.018
It's easier just pushing people away.

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:47.388
Sounds like you're getting
soft in your old age, Frank.

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:48.283
Maybe.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.448
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:03.283
Can I come in?

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:13.503
I'm sorry.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.116
I should've said that
sooner, but I didn't.

01:14:18.118 --> 01:14:19.898
And it was just because I...

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.098
You were trying to help.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.375
Yes, I don't know the
first thing about helping.

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:25.158
I don't know the first
thing helping someone

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.233
especially like you.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.338
To be truthful, I don't
know how you do what you do.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.748
I wouldn't know a normal family dynamic

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.753
if it hit me in the face.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.518
And I came in here and just.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.123
Hey, you were trying to help.

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:43.820
I'm not very good at that.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.153
How's Frank?

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.213
Frank is.

01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:56.958
I'm sorry.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.260
He is full of surprises.

01:15:01.524 --> 01:15:04.608
I never thought there
was a difference between

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:05.788
wanting together be someone

01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:08.588
and just not wanting to be alone.

01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:10.198
I've been alone,

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.213
and I don't know if it's
because I've wanted it

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.563
or just because I just haven't
done anything about it.

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:23.978
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.118
Mom.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.948
Oh, hi, Peter.

01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:27.783
Hi.

01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:30.980
Thanks for all the great stuff.

01:15:30.982 --> 01:15:32.908
I'm glad you liked it.

01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:34.513
I hope you put it to good use.

01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:38.263
Come on I have the telescope all set up.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.973
It's too bright out now.

01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:44.353
But later we'll see lots of stars.

01:15:45.464 --> 01:15:49.438
Do you know any of them,
any of the constellations?

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.668
I had a book when I was a kid

01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:52.128
that had all the constellations in it.

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:54.428
And there was a list that
I'd cross them off with

01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:55.680
whenever I identify them.

01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:58.048
That's sounds awesome.

01:15:58.050 --> 01:15:59.828
Okay, we'll get you the book.

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:01.438
I told you we'll take care of it.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.937
I'll go get my camera.

01:16:02.939 --> 01:16:04.558
Okay.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.238
Thank God she has not stopped bugging me

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.288
about this telescope since she set it up.

01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:10.108
She wants this chart.

01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:11.998
She wants this book thanks to you.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.038
I mean, she basically wants
to survey the entire universe.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.093
Hobbies die hard.

01:16:17.603 --> 01:16:19.068
You know a lot of people
think that you can't see

01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:21.278
anything through a telescope
during the daytime.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.918
But that's not true.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.820
Even where we were in the time of day.

01:16:27.088 --> 01:16:28.253
There you are, hello.

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:31.156
That's Venus.

01:16:31.158 --> 01:16:32.488
What?

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:34.338
- No way?
- Yeah.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.173
I can show you.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.333
Okay.

01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:41.568
Now do you see that little crescent

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:43.003
to the left of those clouds?

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.351
Yeah.

01:16:45.353 --> 01:16:46.184
Yes.

01:16:46.186 --> 01:16:47.458
Yeah.

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.453
That is Venus.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.698
That looks like the moon.

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:52.228
No, no.

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:54.833
That to the right much
bigger that is the moon.

01:16:56.228 --> 01:16:57.061
Huh?

01:16:58.173 --> 01:16:59.870
- Really?
