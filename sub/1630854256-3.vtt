WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:09.810
Welcome.
We're gonna start.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.114
<i>People are paying
to watch them</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:14.482
cut people up alive.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.617
And they're making a lot
of money at it, too.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.052
Albert Barrington. Cindy says
you're looking for the owner

00:18.152 --> 00:20.154
of that BMW that
came in yesterday. Yeah.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.623
Anything you can tell us?
Bobby brought it in,
but the owner wasn't with him.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.792
He's on a tow at the moment.
Should be back inside an hour.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.027
Federal agents.
What do you mean
"federal agents"?

00:27.128 --> 00:28.329
<i>Robert Griffin?</i>

00:28.429 --> 00:30.498
He was convicted
of a murder in '93.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.133
Hold on a second.
Who were we talking to?

00:32.233 --> 00:34.402
Didn't Agent Rand say
there was more than one?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.371
<i>This whole time
we were talking to...</i>

00:37.471 --> 00:38.906
The killers.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.677
What is death?

00:43.777 --> 00:47.481
I ask you knowing
there is no true definition.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.718
To die, to be dead
is only an interpretation

00:50.818 --> 00:54.054
of what we believe it to be.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.258
They said that life,
my friends, is art,

00:57.358 --> 00:59.093
and art itself is life.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.028
If that is our truth,

01:01.129 --> 01:03.597
then how can anyone
truly ever die?

01:03.697 --> 01:07.268
The thing that transcends death
is art.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.669
And so now it is time

01:08.769 --> 01:12.906
to bear witness to that art.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.714
We are here
to be immersed

01:20.814 --> 01:23.417
in the intimately
painful experience

01:23.517 --> 01:26.454
that is God's truth
in human expression.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.990
Life is petty and short,

01:30.090 --> 01:32.993
but art, my brothers
and sisters,

01:33.093 --> 01:35.829
art lasts a millennium.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.833
Yeah, well done.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.335
Dad.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.336
Lord.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.938
Dad.
Yes, son?

02:18.038 --> 02:20.007
What's this?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.944
Well, it looks like a turd.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.646
Look closer.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.915
What, you gonna put the turd
in my face?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.219
It's a cigar butt.
And there's four more of them

02:31.319 --> 02:32.220
in the backyard.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.522
Okay.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.257
Who are you calling?

02:36.357 --> 02:39.627
G. Callen. Looks like you two
need to start an investigation.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.662
Stop it. He's out of town.
Oh, no.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.265
Well, then, maybe
we should call SECNAV.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.666
So you're smoking cigars now?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.968
Well, it's not mine.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.370
Well, whose is it?

02:49.470 --> 02:52.005
It belongs to Arkady.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.040
What?!

02:53.140 --> 02:56.677
Arkady Kolcheck.
Russian. Ex-KGB.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.846
I know who Arkady is.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.251
I got to get to work ASAP.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.486
But this has been
so pleasant.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.854
Arkady's not allowed
in this house.

03:06.954 --> 03:10.057
Well, it's not like he's
napping in your bed.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.191
Excuse me?

03:11.292 --> 03:13.794
Go on to work, son.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.564
My happiness can wait.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.499
No one goes in my bed, Dad.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.001
You understand that?
Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.239
Uh, uh!

03:30.378 --> 03:32.212
Yo, Kens.
Hey. What's going on?

03:32.313 --> 03:33.447
FBI's calling.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.948
A Senior Special Agent
Lisa Rand?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.417
Oh, yeah, we worked together.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.451
She's a great agent.
What did she say?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.219
Okay, so I remember this case.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.554
It was legendary
at the Bureau.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.089
These people, like,
sewed body parts together

03:42.189 --> 03:45.793
and made, like,
Frankenstein monsters.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.928
Yeah, we worked that case.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.398
Yeah, I heard there was
another agency on it.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.700
So it's true.
It was you guys.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.668
Sickest thing I've ever
seen in my life.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.236
Put all of us
in a very dark place.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.005
I can imagine. Yeah.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.207
Let's go see what
Rand has to say.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.044
Agent Rand, good to see you.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.012
Same here.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.580
This is forensic psychologist

04:06.680 --> 04:08.716
Special Agent Zachary Collins.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.784
He's from the Behavioral
Analysis Unit-2.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.219
Nice to meet you.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.487
Uh, so something came up

04:13.587 --> 04:14.755
regarding the Body
Stitchers case?

04:14.855 --> 04:16.624
Short answer, we obtained
some information

04:16.724 --> 04:18.392
that the group is
back in Los Angeles.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.060
That information
turned out to be true.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.962
Bringing up the
case file now.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.631
Oh, my God.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.166
I'm so sorry.
We should have warned you.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.636
Am I seeing what
I think I'm seeing?

04:28.736 --> 04:31.305
Yeah. They sewed
body parts together

04:31.405 --> 04:32.473
from different people.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.841
Do we have a motive for this?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.543
On the surface it's because

04:35.643 --> 04:37.478
they believe they're
creating a type of art.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.847
They construct these bodies

04:39.947 --> 04:42.450
and then charge,
via the dark web,

04:42.550 --> 04:44.385
large sums of money
for viewings.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.686
So it's financial.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.587
Well, the money is
what enables them

04:46.687 --> 04:48.088
to keep doing this.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.223
The generic theory
for a group like this is,

04:50.324 --> 04:51.825
it's sexually motivated.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.695
They've eroticized violence
at a young age.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.998
For them, violence
and sexuality are intertwined.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.634
Albert Barrington,
Cindy Ferguson

05:00.734 --> 05:02.503
Justin Tucker,
Bobby Griffin.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.171
There have been sightings
in the U.S.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.907
and Central and South America,
but they've evaded capture

05:07.007 --> 05:08.576
every time we've
gotten close to them.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.910
And why is that?
Why has it been

05:10.010 --> 05:11.845
so difficult to
capture these guys?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.247
Simply put, they're twisted
but not stupid.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.583
Based on what we've seen,

05:15.683 --> 05:17.084
they only stay in the country
for a few weeks.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.620
They put on a show
and then they quickly move on,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.722
often avoiding ports of entry.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.157
I mean, these guys have
over a dozen aliases.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.194
They're purchasing identities
from the dark web almost weekly.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.796
We need your help.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.898
You're the only people to have
actually seen them in person

05:30.998 --> 05:32.900
and spoken with them.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.835
This no longer concerns

05:34.935 --> 05:37.070
national security
or criminal activity

05:37.170 --> 05:39.673
within the U.S. Naval Service,

05:39.773 --> 05:42.810
so OSP's involvement
will be limited.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.479
I understand.
The FBI is asking for

05:45.579 --> 05:47.415
NCIS's assistance
as either advisers

05:47.515 --> 05:48.682
or part of the task force.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.751
We will take whatever
we can get.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.853
This is unfinished business
for us.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.423
No, this is unfinished
business for the FBI.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.859
They murdered and dismembered
a Navy lieutenant commander.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.928
I read the report.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.397
Lieutenant Commander Weir
was a random victim.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.433
With all due respect, sir,
random or not,

06:05.533 --> 06:09.169
a member of the United States
Navy was cut to pieces.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.806
Okay. But if assets
need to be

06:12.906 --> 06:14.107
brought back into
this office,

06:14.207 --> 06:16.577
your involvement
ends immediately.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.745
Understood.
Okay.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.914
Thank you.
I'm landing in 20.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.683
I'm sending you the address
to the crime scene.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.217
We'll see you there.
Copy that.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.453
Bring Sam up to speed.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.787
We'll meet him there.
On it.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.322
Keep me posted.
Of course, sir.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.474
Lisa.
Guys.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.075
Not the happiest
of reunions.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.477
Yeah, you could say that.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.711
Mark Collins.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.547
Sam Hanna.
Good to meet you.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.716
Good to have some
additional eyes on this

06:55.816 --> 06:58.085
who know what we're
dealing with.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.190
So where did the information
that these guys were

07:03.290 --> 07:05.092
in L.A. come from?

07:05.192 --> 07:07.728
LAPD was investigating
the murder of a woman

07:07.828 --> 07:09.162
named Staci Campbell.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.764
They have a suspect
named Michael Jeffries.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.266
He was seen with Staci
the night of her murder.

07:13.366 --> 07:16.604
LAPD got a warrant
for a phone tap yesterday.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.706
Jeffries got a text
with this address

07:18.806 --> 07:20.273
and a photo of various
body parts.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.309
By the time we got here,
everybody was gone.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.111
This was the only thing
left behind.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.013
Our little gift.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.381
The photo turned out
to be the body parts used

07:28.482 --> 07:29.850
to put this thing together.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.652
I got to talk to
the medical examiner,

07:31.752 --> 07:34.488
but that appears to be
freezer burn.
Makes sense.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.624
If they don't have enough
for a full physique,

07:36.724 --> 07:38.191
they've got to preserve appendages

07:38.291 --> 07:40.427
until they collect enough parts
to make a full body.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.862
Well, that's not disturbing.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.030
But if that's true,
that would completely

07:43.130 --> 07:44.932
mess with time of death.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.800
Jeffries is our only
connection to these people.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.235
Do we have him in custody?

07:48.335 --> 07:50.203
Not for long. We don't
have much to hold him.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.805
We weren't even able
to get a warrant

07:51.905 --> 07:53.807
to search his apartment.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.677
Jeffries was only seen
with Staci that night.

07:56.777 --> 08:00.147
Nothing else ties him
to the murder.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.550
Feel like letting NCIS
take a crack at him?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.451
Oh, please.
Be my guest.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.819
Worth a shot.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.988
All right. Deeks and I,
we'll go with Collins

08:08.088 --> 08:09.456
and work on Jeffries.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.825
Got it. You want
to partner up?
Absolutely.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.293
Be careful.
You, too, babe.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.963
Yeah, what could
possibly go wrong?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.868
Agent Rand, we got it open.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.303
You need to see this.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.748
Oh, my God.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.484
Call the coroner.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.320
Tell them we're gonna
need a couple vans.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.701
Four people, Deeks.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.603
They lied right to my face.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.905
They killed these people,
they dismembered the bodies,

08:58.005 --> 08:59.907
and they sewed them together.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.742
And we had 'em.
I know, I know.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.110
But sometimes
bad guys get away.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.112
But this is different.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.647
Tell me about it,
Agent Hanna.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.048
Admiral?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.784
I mean, you were
with the suspects.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.252
You spoke with them.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.655
So instead of wallowing
in the fact

09:14.755 --> 09:16.189
that you missed something,

09:16.289 --> 09:18.225
why don't you tell us
what you learned from them?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.861
The way they were able to
manipulate the investigation

09:20.961 --> 09:23.030
was extraordinary.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.465
They knew exactly
how to work us.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.167
The time that it took to do
what they did

09:27.267 --> 09:28.769
to Weir and the others...

09:28.869 --> 09:30.537
I mean, the planning,
the execution, the intelligence

09:30.638 --> 09:32.840
was off the charts.
And the funny thing is,

09:32.940 --> 09:34.808
they didn't present as smart.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.878
Good to know.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.715
Jeffries knows we barely
have anything.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.084
He's shrewd.
He's not talking.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.086
Which means we're gonna
have to let him go soon.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.188
What do we know about him?

09:48.288 --> 09:51.024
No record.
He's unemployed.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.960
He's a local.
Most of his earnings

09:53.060 --> 09:55.028
come from short-selling
stocks online.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.664
Any connections to the victims?

09:56.764 --> 09:59.332
He lived in the same
building as Staci Campbell.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.836
And so far no connections to
any of the Body Stitchers.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.939
I've got Kensi and Agent Rand.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.943
LAPD said that the super
of the apartment building

10:10.043 --> 10:11.378
where Jeffries and Staci live

10:11.478 --> 10:13.246
is the witness who
saw them together.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.248
Figured we'd take
another run at him.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.349
Yeah, we need something
to nail Jeffries,

10:16.449 --> 10:17.785
and then use that
to force him

10:17.885 --> 10:18.986
to give us information
on the Stitchers.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.220
Okay, we'll give it
our best shot.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.454
Let us know if
you find anything.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.622
Got it.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.991
Okay, you two are up.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.726
Regardless of how it went
the last time,

10:25.826 --> 10:27.127
remember who you are.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.030
Put the past in the past,
get this thing done.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.674
Hold that thought.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.410
So, Mike-- Sorry.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.446
Do-do you mind if
we call you Mike?

10:46.546 --> 10:48.015
Sure.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.549
See, we're worried
about you.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.219
We're worried that
you look around this shed

10:52.319 --> 10:53.553
and you hear the ocean,

10:53.653 --> 10:56.556
that you smell the
scent of the sea...

10:56.656 --> 10:59.592
Breathe the clean air,
feel the cool breeze.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.494
We're worried, with all
that Pacific splendor,

11:01.594 --> 11:04.097
that you're missing
the cold, hard truth.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.466
I didn't kill Staci.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.436
We were neighbors.
I never touched her.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.872
That's not the truth
we're talking about.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.106
So what is it?

11:13.206 --> 11:15.308
That you're deep
in federal custody.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.946
That you're surrounded by
frustrated and angry agents

11:19.046 --> 11:21.048
from multiple agencies.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.550
And we're hungry,

11:23.650 --> 11:25.986
and you're the only thing
on the menu.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.323
Well, then, I guess
the kitchen's closed

11:30.423 --> 11:33.226
because you don't have
anything on me.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.195
Well, maybe not
on Staci Campbell yet,

11:35.295 --> 11:37.497
but we have you in connection
with serial killers

11:37.597 --> 11:38.966
who have crossed
several jurisdictions

11:39.066 --> 11:42.102
and done some very,
very bad things.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.337
Including the abduction
and murder

11:44.437 --> 11:47.174
of a highly decorated
naval officer.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.242
That's some hard-core time, Mikey.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.611
I mean, that's Leavenwor--
Is that Leavenworth time?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.181
That's Leavenworth time.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.983
But that has nothing
to do with me.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.250
See, that's what's interesting,

11:57.350 --> 11:58.618
'cause we have
conclusive evidence

11:58.718 --> 12:00.120
you were in contact
with these people, Mike.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.322
Provided 'em with finances.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.925
Have intimate knowledge
of their operations.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.559
I'm just a fan of their work.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.095
What, you're just, you're just
a good old-fashioned

12:08.195 --> 12:09.496
patron of the arts?

12:09.596 --> 12:12.866
People love true crime
and serial killers.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.002
They eat that up.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.904
Is that wrong?

12:17.004 --> 12:19.439
I didn't know that
these people were murderers.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.441
Where did you imagine
the bodies came from?

12:21.541 --> 12:23.176
Oh, damn, that's
a good question.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.712
Uh, grave robbers.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.015
The morgue.
I don't know.

12:28.115 --> 12:31.051
I just watch their performances.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.453
That's all I know
about them.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.527
Philip Guerrero.

12:40.627 --> 12:44.264
FBI Special Agent Rand,
Special Agent Blye, NCIS.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.466
Special agents?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.735
Is this about
the young lady in 2-B?

12:48.836 --> 12:50.070
Yeah, Staci Campbell.

12:50.170 --> 12:54.407
Yeah. She was a good tenant.
Nice girl.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.109
We know you've answered
these questions already,

12:56.209 --> 12:58.745
but could you tell us
again what you saw?

12:58.846 --> 13:00.080
Maybe you'll
remember details

13:00.180 --> 13:01.614
that may help us
figure out who killed her.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.852
Look, I only saw Mike and Staci

13:04.952 --> 13:07.554
walking into the courtyard
together, that's it.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.823
They were talking.
They seemed fine.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.624
Could you hear what
they were saying?

13:11.724 --> 13:14.327
Yeah. They were talking about
how the delivery people

13:14.427 --> 13:16.663
leave too many menus
at the mailboxes.

13:16.763 --> 13:17.730
Did anybody else see them?

13:17.831 --> 13:21.234
Not that I know of.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.802
How about any other friends?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.504
Someone else in the building
we could talk to?

13:24.604 --> 13:26.273
Nah, they both kept to thems--

13:26.373 --> 13:28.175
Oh, I mean,
there's Mrs. Jeffries.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.344
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jeffries?
His wife?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.046
No, Mike's mother.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.316
She moved in with him...
last month?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.317
She's an invalid.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.452
Had a partial stroke.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.226
She's a nice lady.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.028
I bring her food deliveries
from time to time.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.863
That's very thoughtful of you.

13:49.963 --> 13:53.133
Mrs. Jeffries?

13:57.137 --> 13:58.305
Her room's way in the back.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.940
She might not be able
to hear us.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.075
Well, if she's by herself,
maybe you should check on her.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.577
Yeah, right. Of course.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.879
Mm-hmm.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.119
Mrs. Jeffries?

14:12.219 --> 14:14.421
Mrs. Jeffries?
Hey, guys. Any luck?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.990
Negative. Look, we know
that they've been using

14:17.090 --> 14:18.926
the dark web to sell
tickets to their shows.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.828
All the money leads
to offshore accounts,

14:21.929 --> 14:23.063
which are all

14:23.163 --> 14:25.198
pretty much dead ends.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.134
Mr. Guerrero.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.302
Kens!
Yep.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.686
Mrs. Jeffries?

14:46.786 --> 14:48.788
Ma'am?

14:51.824 --> 14:52.960
Don't breathe in.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.841
Hey, guys, so,
due to the health hazard,

15:08.942 --> 15:11.411
LAPD has finished
clearing out the complex.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.546
All residents have been
temporarily relocated.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.983
Are you sure that you
and Agent Rand are okay?

15:16.083 --> 15:18.051
Yeah. As soon as we
smelled the vapor,

15:18.151 --> 15:19.286
we didn't breathe in.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.720
Guerrero, however,
took a big hit

15:20.820 --> 15:22.289
on those sulfuric
acid fumes,

15:22.389 --> 15:24.024
so the medic is
taking a look at him.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.358
We think it's the mom?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.360
It seems to be,

15:27.460 --> 15:30.197
but we have to wait
for that positive ID.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.999
Sulfuric acid is easy to get.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.100
It'll be impossible to trace.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.702
Okay. What else do we have?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.470
Uh, we know that
the Stitchers

15:37.570 --> 15:39.439
frequently bought
their identities

15:39.539 --> 15:41.641
on the dark web,
but we have no idea

15:41.741 --> 15:43.876
where those IDs originated.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.145
What about the crypto?

15:45.245 --> 15:48.115
Same. The problem is,
the dark web is

15:48.215 --> 15:49.983
a vast chasm of
seemingly endless

15:50.083 --> 15:51.318
repetitive data.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.952
So unless we have
a clear starting point,

15:53.053 --> 15:54.454
this could take days.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.989
Which we don't have.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.658
And these guys don't stay
in the same place very long.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.094
Pretty sure it's Mrs. Jeffries.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.529
We found her titanium knee.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.832
All right, people,
what are we thinking here?

16:05.932 --> 16:08.801
Maybe she knew something that
would incriminate her son,

16:08.901 --> 16:09.869
so he killed her.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.504
Ultimately,
that might not track,

16:11.604 --> 16:13.373
unless he had an accomplice.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.608
But given the lack
of corrosion in the tub

16:15.708 --> 16:17.377
and the amount
of remaining tissue,

16:17.477 --> 16:18.978
this is less than 12 hours old.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.248
So Jeffries couldn't
have done it.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.682
He would already be in custody.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.252
All right, let's talk
to Jeffries

16:25.352 --> 16:26.819
about his mother's murder

16:26.919 --> 16:29.222
and gauge his reaction
to the news.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.557
On it.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.136
Oh, good, three of you.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.638
Must be my lucky day.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.040
Tell us about your mother.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.808
Why? What about her?

16:48.908 --> 16:50.277
When's the last time
you saw her?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.412
Well, obviously before this.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.414
We know she has
health problems.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.016
She had a stroke.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.952
Why do you suddenly care
so much about my mom?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.454
You never mentioned her.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.855
She's sick, she's old.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.791
Seems like you would
have somebody looking

17:04.891 --> 17:06.526
after her while
you're here.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.861
Did she say something
to you?

17:08.961 --> 17:10.630
She's dead, Mike.

17:10.730 --> 17:15.602
Somebody tried to melt her
in a tub filled with acid.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.805
What?
Is that true?

17:18.905 --> 17:20.473
Yeah.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.610
Do you know who'd
want to hurt her?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.445
This is your fault.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.314
You guys, you did this.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.116
We had nothing
to do with this.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.117
He did.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.220
Look, you...
you don't get it.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.789
These guys are gonna know
the Feds went to that location.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.925
They're gonna know
they got the location

17:39.025 --> 17:40.760
from one of us.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.496
There are very few people
that know the time and place

17:43.596 --> 17:44.764
of these performances.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.133
I'm probably the only one
on the list

17:46.233 --> 17:48.301
that bought a seat
that didn't show up.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.569
So then they
kill your mom?

17:49.669 --> 17:51.138
Mike, that doesn't
make any sense.

17:51.238 --> 17:55.342
I wasn't there.
She was.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.210
I mean, maybe she saw
their faces,

17:57.310 --> 17:59.646
or maybe it was retribution.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.248
I mean, they have to figure
that I'm the one

18:01.348 --> 18:02.515
that gave up the location.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.151
Or she knew you
murdered Staci Campbell,

18:04.251 --> 18:05.985
and you thought she was
gonna tell the police,

18:06.085 --> 18:07.754
and so you paid somebody
to turn her into

18:07.854 --> 18:09.021
a puddle of melted butter.

18:09.122 --> 18:12.159
You can believe
whatever you want.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.362
But I need protection
from these people.

18:15.462 --> 18:18.631
They're gonna kill me.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.134
I'll give you the location
on the dark web

18:21.234 --> 18:24.204
where you can find the
information about their shows.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.806
Really?
Yes.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.776
But you have to protect me.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.778
Yeah.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.432
All right, the address that
Jeffries sent us is legit.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.034
So, this is the site
where the Stitchers

18:55.134 --> 18:58.271
promote their "art"
and receive crypto?

18:58.371 --> 18:59.906
Yeah, but it's wiped clean now.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.442
Yeah, but the good news is,
once information is out

19:02.542 --> 19:05.111
on the dark web,
it spreads and multiplies.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.446
So regardless of how well

19:06.546 --> 19:07.714
they think they covered
their tracks,

19:07.814 --> 19:09.816
now we have their
encrypted email service.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.219
Which gives us the ability
to search the dark web

19:12.319 --> 19:14.487
for the new forum they move
information to.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.423
So, even if they
move again,

19:16.523 --> 19:18.591
forum to forum,
we'll be able to track them.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.926
Exactly.
Hey.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.362
Hey, Kens.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.298
We are close. Should have
something for you soon.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.733
Got it. Uh, I just
sent you a picture

19:26.833 --> 19:28.768
that the coroner took
of Michael Jeffries' mother.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.704
What the hell am I looking at?

19:31.804 --> 19:33.506
So, that would be

19:33.606 --> 19:36.108
Mrs. Jeffries' right forearm.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.510
According to the coroner,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.111
her right hand was sawed off

19:39.212 --> 19:40.613
with a serrated blade.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.582
He said it happened before
she was put into the acid.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.917
Well, that's
the Stitchers' M.O.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.719
Jeffries could be
telling the truth.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.120
He might be the target.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.290
His mom could have been
collateral damage.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.292
I found the Stitchers'
new forum.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.860
What is that?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.562
A live stream.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.097
It's gonna start soon
but it's password-protected.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.632
Let me work on this.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.701
Oh, geez, this is how they're
making all their money.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.002
And it's not just
the live audience.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.937
They're selling this
all over the world.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.574
Cracked the password.
Live stream's up.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.076
Looks like it still
hasn't started.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.378
We got an address?

20:11.478 --> 20:13.346
Abandoned theater complex
in Woodland Hills.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.581
Address is on your phones.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.748
All right,
we'll meet you there.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.016
Oh, no.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.018
What is it, Agent Rountree?

20:19.118 --> 20:20.753
Level three domestic
terrorist warning.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.855
What?
Intel coming in about
a possible attack

20:22.955 --> 20:25.091
in San Pedro regarding
an OSP case.

20:25.191 --> 20:28.695
Like I said, assets will have
to come back to the office.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.130
Who's gonna deal with this?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.833
I got it. I got it. Go.
Go quickly. Go.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.168
You sure?
Go. Yeah.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.387
We have to get everyone
in position.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.955
You heard her.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.324
SWAT's on the way, but they're
still 30 minutes out.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.893
Well, we can't wait.
Let's go.
All right.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.804
Do we know which theater?
Uh, no.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.540
How many theaters are there?
Sixteen.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.175
Great.
All right, looks like
we got to split up.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.655
Okay, we'll take five.
I got six.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.411
This place is huge,
there's too many places to hide.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.745
They could be anywhere.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.447
Comms aren't great in here.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.416
Stay alert.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.836
Today will be the Harvest.

22:18.104 --> 22:21.841
This is where we acquire
our raw materials,

22:21.941 --> 22:26.479
and enjoy a moment
witnessing the razor's edge

22:26.579 --> 22:28.881
between life and death.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.584
I found them. Theater eight.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.720
One minute away.
Coming to you.

22:33.820 --> 22:37.924
...does not come simply
from my motivational tools.

22:38.024 --> 22:42.662
No, the real secret is
enabling this man

22:42.762 --> 22:46.999
to bear witness
to his own suffering

22:47.099 --> 22:50.770
for as long as humanly possible.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.773
Who is that?
Hold your fire.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.808
Federal agents.
Do not move!

22:58.478 --> 23:01.347
FBI. Do not move!

23:04.917 --> 23:07.487
Freeze!
Hands above your head.

23:07.587 --> 23:10.022
Drop the knife.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.200
I need an EMT
outside theater eight.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.069
I'm fine. Al Barrington.
Copy that.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.171
That way.
All right, I got it.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.261
Easy, easy, easy.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.263
Son of a bitch.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.869
Hallway's clear.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.895
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.897
Get him some water, blankets.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.866
We're gonna need to
question him.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.313
We got Bobby Griffin.
He's dead.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.449
I'm still trying to figure out
who shot him.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.863
Federal agent!

25:00.366 --> 25:01.934
Stand up.

25:04.604 --> 25:07.707
Hands where I can
see them. Up.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.576
Take off your mask.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.750
Cindy Ferguson.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.086
Long time no see.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.623
Turn around.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.429
Right hand behind
your back, now.

25:36.903 --> 25:40.372
You're not getting
away... again.

25:49.582 --> 25:53.452
Hey, federal agent!
Do not move.

25:54.687 --> 25:55.855
You're Justin Tucker.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.957
I know who you are.
This is over.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.527
Drop the knife.

26:01.628 --> 26:03.863
That's suicide, man,
you know that.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.735
Drop the knife.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.336
Hey!

26:12.038 --> 26:14.506
Ah...

26:14.607 --> 26:16.609
Damn it.

26:16.709 --> 26:19.011
I've got Justin Tucker
going down the east elevator.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.279
Is anyone down there?

26:20.379 --> 26:21.580
I've got eyes on the elevator.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.215
He's got a knife.
Proceed with caution.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.154
Guys, he just stopped
the elevator between floors.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.589
Coming to you. Copy.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.972
This is FBI Agent Collins.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.577
Justin Tucker,
we know who you are.

26:51.678 --> 26:52.979
This is over.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.047
There are federal agents
on every floor.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.016
Just bring the elevator back.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.051
Not coming out.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.486
I-I want a cell phone.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.989
What do you want
a cell phone for?

27:03.089 --> 27:05.457
I want to speak to Vincent.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.593
Who's Vincent?

27:07.694 --> 27:10.897
Vincent is the last
living great master.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.732
You know what he's
talking about?

27:12.832 --> 27:14.701
Mm-mm.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.844
Agent down! Agent down!

27:24.944 --> 27:26.278
Collins, is that you?

27:28.480 --> 27:31.150
If you can hear me,
I'm coming for you.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.688
Collins!
I'm here.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.223
Geez, you okay?

27:37.323 --> 27:39.225
It was Barrington.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.893
He hit me in the head.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.394
Cut my neck.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.396
Uh, we got a knife wound.
I need medical assistance.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.498
Come on.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.735
Hello?!

27:48.835 --> 27:50.102
The comms aren't working.

27:50.202 --> 27:51.403
These walls must be
blocking the signal.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.405
I'm okay.
He took off that way.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.373
Get him.

27:54.473 --> 27:55.674
I'm okay.
Are you sure?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.676
Yeah. Go, go, go.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.314
Barrington!

28:06.652 --> 28:08.620
Damn it.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.258
Albert Barrington...

28:12.358 --> 28:15.094
this is NCIS.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.796
It's over.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.435
Give yourself up.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.471
Come on, Al, it's done.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.250
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.056
Barrington!

28:44.156 --> 28:47.093
This Vincent,
does he have a last name?

28:47.193 --> 28:49.195
I'm not telling you that.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.798
I just need to speak to him.

28:51.898 --> 28:54.366
Okay, look, I'm not gonna send
anybody else in there.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.535
I already have
a wounded agent.

28:56.635 --> 28:59.238
Yeah, I hear you.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.073
Give me a minute.
Let me talk to Deeks.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.909
Well, you know where I'll be.

29:04.643 --> 29:07.479
Okay, Alexander,
do you recognize him?

29:08.314 --> 29:10.416
Yeah, he was there, too.

29:11.984 --> 29:15.121
He held me down while the
two other guys cuffed me.

29:18.124 --> 29:21.027
What about her?

29:21.127 --> 29:22.594
Yeah, she was there.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.531
He's identified all of them. Wait.

29:25.631 --> 29:28.667
Wait, you don't have a photo
of the main guy?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.570
I'm sorry, there was
someone else there?

29:31.670 --> 29:34.406
Yeah.

29:34.506 --> 29:38.210
Yeah. Whoever he was,
he was in charge.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.916
I swear I thought I heard
one of them call him "Master."

29:44.016 --> 29:46.285
Master? What did he look like?

29:48.187 --> 29:49.588
I just heard his voice.

29:49.688 --> 29:53.459
Tucker keeps asking to talk
to a guy named Vincent.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.027
Says he's the last
great master.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.295
What about Cindy Ferguson?

29:56.395 --> 29:57.964
FBI's taking her back
to the boatshed.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.331
But I'm gonna ask her about
this great master Vincent guy,

29:59.431 --> 30:00.499
see what she says.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.101
It's definitely worth a shot.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.070
All right, we'll see if we can
find Albert Barrington.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.304
If not, we'll head back.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.273
Got it. See you guys
in a minute.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.243
I think I've got him
coming up. Good.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.445
It's been five minutes.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.415
Do we have a deal?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.584
You're giving me a guarantee?

30:18.684 --> 30:21.854
Yes. You come out,
we take you into custody,

30:21.954 --> 30:23.189
you can call Vincent.

30:23.289 --> 30:26.692
I promise, Justin.
I don't lie.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.730
Okay.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.308
Drop the knife, Justin.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.485
I said drop the knife.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.754
Come on, Justin,
you're surrounded.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.523
Drop the knife.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.160
No!
No!

31:01.260 --> 31:04.496
We need an EMT at the elevator,
second floor, now.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.365
Copy that.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.315
Remember me?

31:24.683 --> 31:27.053
I don't remember
insignificant people.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.322
You know who's insignificant?

31:30.422 --> 31:31.890
People who spend
their entire lives

31:31.991 --> 31:34.526
in a twelve-by-seven cement box
with a four-inch window.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.762
And that's about to be you.

31:39.131 --> 31:43.936
Imagination can turn that box
into the Grand Canyon,

31:44.036 --> 31:47.573
or the Palace at Versailles.

31:50.776 --> 31:52.611
I want to know about
Michael Jeffries.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.480
How long has he been
working with you?

31:54.580 --> 31:58.217
I don't know who that is.

31:58.317 --> 32:02.421
But let me ask you a question.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.490
Okay, shoot.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.026
Is talking to you
worth my time?

32:07.126 --> 32:10.262
Or is it just taking up space
in my head

32:10.362 --> 32:14.100
that could be used for more
creative and beautiful thoughts?

32:14.200 --> 32:17.603
She's not gonna give us
anything, she's too committed.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.306
Hmm.
You simply don't know art.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.773
What are you gonna do
with Jeffries?

32:21.873 --> 32:23.542
Not much.
We got nothing to hold him.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.378
Good news is Jeffries' lawyer
is still asking

32:26.478 --> 32:27.879
we put him into
witness protection.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.149
That's the next best thing
besides having him in custody.

32:30.249 --> 32:31.650
That is your job.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.320
What about
your Domestic Terrorist alert?

32:34.420 --> 32:35.654
They just needed
some case information.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.423
It's all taken care of.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.526
What is it?

32:43.129 --> 32:45.331
I'd like another shot at her.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.866
Something's not right.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.037
I love it
when he gets that look.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.872
I remember you.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.476
Oh, the three of us,
back together again.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.545
How's the car?

32:59.645 --> 33:01.413
Get a good repair shop?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.415
See what I've been
dealing with?

33:03.515 --> 33:05.117
Let me talk to her.

33:05.217 --> 33:06.552
Oh, please do.

33:06.652 --> 33:10.022
But it was going so well.

33:13.559 --> 33:16.228
So...

33:16.328 --> 33:18.664
Special Agent Sam Hanna.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.432
And I'm here to inform you

33:20.532 --> 33:22.234
because of your lack
of cooperation,

33:22.334 --> 33:24.570
we're going to be turning you
over to the FBI for processing.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.406
I was never going
to cooperate with you.
We know.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.408
Because you're stupid.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.510
You know

33:31.610 --> 33:33.712
who isn't stupid?

33:33.812 --> 33:35.514
Vincent.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.484
That's right.
We got him.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.586
Right now,
he's telling the FBI

33:40.686 --> 33:43.122
everything they need
to know about you.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.691
For everything he says,
he gets time off his sentence,

33:45.791 --> 33:48.860
and puts you behind bars
for the rest of your life.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.063
You don't have him in custody.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.464
You never will.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.934
Sorry. Done deal. We got him.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.936
Doesn't matter.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.405
He's a great master.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.307
Is he your master?

34:01.407 --> 34:03.309
Help me understand this.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.711
Nobody's my master.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.247
So, he's not your master.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.048
He's somebody else's master?

34:10.149 --> 34:12.884
Uh, what do you think we are--
some kind of a cheesy cult?

34:12.984 --> 34:14.653
I'm just

34:14.753 --> 34:16.488
a government employee.
Explain it to me.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.724
He's a great master,

34:18.824 --> 34:21.893
like Leonardo da Vinci,

34:21.993 --> 34:24.096
Michelangelo,

34:24.196 --> 34:26.465
Renoir, these humans

34:26.565 --> 34:27.833
who changed the world

34:27.933 --> 34:29.835
with their imagination
and a pencil.

34:29.935 --> 34:33.905
So Vincent is a master artist?

34:34.005 --> 34:37.209
Yeah, Vincent,
like Vincent van Gogh.

34:37.309 --> 34:40.779
Uh... You know?

34:43.249 --> 34:44.950
Yeah.

34:45.050 --> 34:47.153
He's the great master
behind the bodies.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.887
It's his vision.

34:48.987 --> 34:52.124
We're just his apprentices,
learning the art.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.128
The art
of sewing bodies together?

34:58.164 --> 35:00.232
God. Isn't it beautiful?

35:02.868 --> 35:06.272
If not beautiful,
at least affecting, right?

35:06.372 --> 35:08.274
You have
to acknowledge that.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.342
Oh, you're right.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.378
I'll never forget it.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.247
Nobody will.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.115
Ever.

35:18.517 --> 35:22.788
Through his art,
Vincent made us immortal.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.592
In a sense, he made us gods.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.130
We would die for him.

35:46.245 --> 35:49.748
I got to tell you, Pop,
this meal was great.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.484
Figure my cooking'll
give you a reason

35:52.584 --> 35:53.819
to keep me around.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.387
There's a fight tonight.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.955
WBA middleweight championship.
You want to watch it?

36:00.192 --> 36:01.760
Wonder who that is.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.129
Ah, that's Arkady,
but don't worry.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.764
I told him
he can't come inside.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.032
What's he doing here?

36:07.132 --> 36:08.500
Well, he's coming
to pick me up.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.203
Taking me to poker night.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.106
I assume
there's going to be drinking.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.443
Mm. Good whiskey,
I hope.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.445
You want me
to be happy about it?

36:19.545 --> 36:21.513
Well, son, I-I-I...

36:21.613 --> 36:23.515
I-I'd think that you'd be happy

36:23.615 --> 36:26.418
that I have a friend,
somewhere to go.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.488
Perhaps even have a few laughs.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.490
Dad, I get it.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.526
I'm just doing the best I can
to take care of you.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.495
Yeah. Samuel,

36:36.595 --> 36:40.766
I don't know how long I have,
but I'm going to live it.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.236
As full a life as it can be.

36:48.006 --> 36:51.176
I want that, too.
Have fun, Dad.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.011
Thanks.

36:53.111 --> 36:57.516
Hey, um, you have any
extra cash, stake my game?

36:57.616 --> 36:59.117
A couple of hundred bucks
will do it.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.553
A couple hundred bucks on
my salary? Are you kidding me?

37:03.121 --> 37:04.956
Come on, son.
I'm just messing with you.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.025
Yeah. Don't let
Arkady cheat you, huh?

37:07.125 --> 37:08.727
Please.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.879
Hey. Thought you was on a plane.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.715
I just got to the airport.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.917
Listen, I think
we missed something.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.352
What?

37:33.452 --> 37:34.986
I just sent you
the preliminary autopsy report.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.923
The M.E. said
that given the blood lividity

37:38.023 --> 37:40.592
in Jeffries' mother,
she was dead at least 48 hours

37:40.692 --> 37:42.561
before she was put
in the acid bath.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.663
That's before
Jeffries was in custody.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.498
I think he killed his mother.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.900
And if Jeffries was the one
who cut off her hand...

37:49.000 --> 37:50.702
Then he's involved
with the Body Stitchers.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.671
Where is he now?

37:52.771 --> 37:54.239
Collins took him to a safe house

37:54.340 --> 37:56.174
in San Diego
for protective custody.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.043
You want to have
another conversation with him?

37:58.143 --> 38:00.178
Hell yeah. Let me know
when you talk to Collins.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.513
Of course.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.685
Hey, Sam.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.154
Fatima. Look, I know it's late.

38:09.254 --> 38:10.822
It's okay. I'm up.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.991
Did you get the, uh, security
cameras around the theater yet?

38:13.091 --> 38:15.026
Kaleidoscope's still
working on it.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.928
I can log in
and see if we got a hit

38:17.028 --> 38:18.664
on Albert Barrington
exiting the theater?

38:18.764 --> 38:20.198
That'd be great.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.867
Is something wrong?

38:21.967 --> 38:23.735
I'm not sure. Just let me know
when you find something.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.103
Yeah, of course.

38:25.203 --> 38:27.339
All right.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.581
Ooh.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.717
Hey. How'd it go?

38:40.519 --> 38:43.221
Dementia can eat my shorts.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.926
Have a good night, son.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.896
Good night, Pop.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.271
Kaleidoscope found this
security camera that showed

39:00.372 --> 39:03.174
Albert Barrington leaving
the theater out the back door.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.143
I'm zooming in.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.847
He has someone helping him.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.082
Someone wearing a dress shirt.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.284
I can't remember.
Does that shirt match any

39:13.385 --> 39:14.686
of the audience members?

39:14.786 --> 39:16.688
No. Now keep searching.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.657
Let me know
if you find anything else.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.126
You got it.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.498
Albert Barrington?

39:26.598 --> 39:29.367
This is NCIS.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.503
It's over.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.907
He's gone.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.109
Let's move.

39:56.327 --> 39:59.297
The whole state's going
to be looking for us after this.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.933
The sooner we're out of here,
the better.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.235
I wrote
in your psychological profile

40:04.335 --> 40:06.538
that you're most likely headed
to Florida,

40:06.638 --> 40:08.373
to your hometown, Orlando.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.308
Don't worry about it.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.878
In a few hours, you'll be
halfway around the world

40:12.978 --> 40:15.447
sipping rum on a beach.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.186
Let me ask you something.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.121
How well do you know
Special Agent Collins?

40:23.221 --> 40:26.725
I met him once I started working
the Body Stitchers case.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.393
He asked me
if he could get involved.

40:28.494 --> 40:30.228
He's profiled
many serial killers.

40:30.328 --> 40:33.131
Figured I could use his help.
Why?

40:42.173 --> 40:44.109
It's a present from my mother.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.311
She wanted to give you a hand.

40:47.546 --> 40:48.880
Thank you.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.716
Okay, we did good.

40:50.816 --> 40:54.119
Got rid of the idiot amateurs
who were going to get us caught.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.755
For as long
as humanly possible.

40:58.924 --> 41:02.160
Federal agents! Do not move!

41:02.260 --> 41:05.063
We're going to lay low
for a very long time now.

41:05.163 --> 41:08.834
I got you both IDs
with new identities,

41:08.934 --> 41:11.336
plane tickets,
ten grand in cash.

41:11.436 --> 41:13.138
Get in touch
when you need more.

41:13.238 --> 41:16.341
Eventually,
when we do come back together,

41:16.441 --> 41:20.278
I'm thinking that we stop
making conventional bodies.

41:20.378 --> 41:23.114
I mean, why make a body
with two arms

41:23.214 --> 41:26.985
when you can make one
with five arms and three legs,

41:27.085 --> 41:30.789
maybe a head
growing out of a stomach?

41:30.889 --> 41:32.290
Think about it.

41:32.390 --> 41:35.426
What would Picasso
or Dalí do?

41:39.430 --> 41:41.667
I just got a text
from the agent

41:41.767 --> 41:43.301
at the San Diego safe house.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.937
Collins and Jeffries
still haven't shown up.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.339
I got a bad feeling.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.776
I think something might have
happened to Collins.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.911
I think
it may be worse than that.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.512
What are you thinking?

41:59.284 --> 42:02.721
Yeah, Vincent,
like Vincent van Gogh.

42:02.821 --> 42:06.291
Uh... You know?

42:11.429 --> 42:14.833
I know why you haven't been able
to catch 'em all these years.

42:14.933 --> 42:18.570
He's been feeding 'em
information, protecting 'em.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.405
Who was?

42:23.408 --> 42:25.977
I think Special Agent Collins
is Vincent.
