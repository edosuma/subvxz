WEBVTT

01:31.000 --> 01:33.083
(Will)
'Got to say, Scotty,
not a bad cook.'

01:33.166 --> 01:34.500
Even learning to
pick up after
himself.

01:34.583 --> 01:36.041
Forget it.
I ain't taking Vera.

01:36.125 --> 01:39.000
You want him out of your
place,
man up and tell him.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.500
How about just
for a weekend?

01:40.583 --> 01:42.917
Hey, Lil..

01:43.000 --> 01:45.208
Have mercy.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.375
Colin Blake.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.208
Embezzlement, fraud, assault.

01:49.291 --> 01:51.709
Fresh out of the can. Here
to tell us you're innocent?

01:51.792 --> 01:54.458
I wish I was. I'm not
making any excuses.

01:54.542 --> 01:57.792
Stealing from dead and disabled
servicemen. Pretty cold.

01:57.875 --> 02:00.125
And that got you
30 years in Allenwood?

02:00.208 --> 02:01.250
(Colin)
'Ten to fifteen.'

02:01.333 --> 02:02.875
Tried to break
out a few months in

02:02.959 --> 02:06.375
and a...a CO got hurt..

02:06.458 --> 02:08.208
...and the judge
doubled me up.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.083
You sound like
an angry guy,
Colin.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.166
You'd have
been angry
too.

02:12.250 --> 02:16.166
'The reason I tried to break
out...my daughter, Sarah.'

02:16.250 --> 02:18.333
Found stabbed to
death
in an abandoned lot

02:18.417 --> 02:20.917
two months
after I went
in.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.709
Seventeen years old.

02:25.834 --> 02:28.000
Sarah was
everything to me.

02:28.083 --> 02:30.458
Her mom died
when she was 13.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.125
Just the two of us.

02:32.208 --> 02:34.583
Stood by me
through the trial.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.291
Up to the night..

02:36.375 --> 02:37.834
...before I went in.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.375
You'll finish out your
last
few weeks of school
here.

02:41.458 --> 02:42.875
Uh, then I've
made arrangements

02:42.959 --> 02:44.166
'for you to stay
with your Aunt Laura.'

02:44.250 --> 02:46.250
Dad, I'm not leaving.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.542
We're gonna fight this.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.417
You're innocent.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.291
Sarah..

02:53.875 --> 02:55.333
...I'm not.

03:00.250 --> 03:03.000
I can't forget
that look..

03:03.083 --> 03:05.500
...her knowing
I was a criminal.

03:05.583 --> 03:06.959
Any suspects
in her murder.

03:07.041 --> 03:08.041
Nothing.

03:08.125 --> 03:09.834
The detective thought

03:09.917 --> 03:11.125
she was a runaway.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.083
'Thirty years, no leads'

03:13.166 --> 03:14.875
and then
yesterday
I get released

03:14.959 --> 03:16.792
and I find this.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.917
(Lilly)
'Hmm. The Jackals.'

03:19.000 --> 03:20.625
Outlaw motorcycle gang.

03:20.709 --> 03:22.417
Know who the guy
in this photo is?

03:22.500 --> 03:25.250
I was hoping
you could tell me.

03:25.333 --> 03:26.375
Where'd you get this?

03:26.458 --> 03:28.166
Prison stored my
checked belongings.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.959
Somebody must have
slipped it in there

03:30.041 --> 03:31.959
knowing I'd find it
when I got released.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.291
Jackals MC's hardcore.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.417
Drugs, guns, extortion.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.417
Sarah was a good girl.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.792
An honor roll student.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.333
Good athlete.

03:41.417 --> 03:43.458
The picture's from
the Fourth of July.

03:43.542 --> 03:45.083
(Colin)
'A few months after I went
in'

03:45.166 --> 03:47.792
and a few days before..

03:48.667 --> 03:49.709
...she was killed.

03:49.792 --> 03:51.083
You thinking
she was tore up

03:51.166 --> 03:53.291
over what you did.
Started acting out?

03:53.375 --> 03:56.000
(Colin)
'Sarah believed in me.
I let her down.'

03:56.083 --> 03:58.458
She must have
been desperate.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.208
Detectives, I
have to know.

04:01.291 --> 04:03.500
What happened
to my little girl?

04:41.375 --> 04:44.208
(Lilly)
'Sarah Blake, 17 years old.'

04:44.291 --> 04:46.125
Stabbed over 30 times.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.834
Dumped in a shallow grave
near Hog Island Road.

04:48.917 --> 04:52.375
Knife blade broke off in
her
sternum. That's a lot of
rage.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.375
Defensive wounds
on the arms and hands.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.709
The girl put up a fight.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.834
The Philadelphia Jackals
are still around today.

04:57.917 --> 04:59.458
Meth trade, prostitution.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.417
It's less about riding than
running a criminal
enterprise.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.208
Who was the leader
of that pack in
'76?

05:03.291 --> 05:06.834
John Clark, aka "Shameless."
And still at it today.

05:06.917 --> 05:09.667
Rap sheet about ran
the printer out of ink.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.875
(Kat)
What's a 17-year-old
honor student

05:11.959 --> 05:13.333
doing running
around
with these losers?

05:13.417 --> 05:15.542
Betrayed by your dad,
nowhere to go..

05:15.625 --> 05:17.917
...bad boys start looking good.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.875
Said the girl who ran off
with a man on a motorcycle.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.375
- Well, he was different.
- Hmm.

05:22.458 --> 05:23.583
(Lilly)
'Frank, are you able to get'

05:23.667 --> 05:24.875
anything off the photo?

05:24.959 --> 05:26.542
(Kat)
Instamatic camera.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.542
About as common as it gets.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.375
See the one-percenter patch?
That's an outlaw badge of
honor.

05:31.458 --> 05:34.500
The 1% of the bikers who
cause 99% of all the
trouble.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.208
I got a buddy on
the state police task force

05:36.291 --> 05:38.291
watchdogging the Jackals.
I'll see what he can run
down.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.834
We need to find out who put
that photo in Colin's box.

05:40.917 --> 05:43.000
Prison trustees with
access to the storage
area?

05:43.083 --> 05:45.959
(Lilly)
Dad might have overstated
Sarah's good girl status.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.333
School records have her
suspended for fighting.

05:48.417 --> 05:50.750
Took a shot at some girl
for mouthing off about her
dad.

05:50.834 --> 05:54.166
Another girl jumped in
and wound up getting expelled.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.333
Libby Traynor.

05:55.417 --> 05:56.917
Partner in crime
or a bad
influence

05:57.000 --> 05:58.250
on a good girl?

05:58.333 --> 06:00.625
Might know about her
walk on the wild side.

06:00.709 --> 06:02.083
I'll talk to her.

06:02.166 --> 06:04.250
I'll hit the Jackals'
clubhouse, see what's what.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.583
You're spitting
in the wind,
Scotty.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.667
Bikers don't talk to cops.

06:07.750 --> 06:10.500
Oh, that's 'cause
nobody ever sent me.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.625
Hey, don't worry.
I'll be polite.

06:12.709 --> 06:16.166
Yeah, just the same, take
somebody along. Watch your back.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.792
I'll keep you from
putting your foot in it.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.083
(Scotty)
'Hey.'

06:33.959 --> 06:35.625
- You Shameless?
- 'Yo, what's this, man?'

06:35.709 --> 06:38.125
(Kat)
Couple of questions
about Sarah Blake.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.959
Girl you might have
known back in '76.

06:41.041 --> 06:42.458
Never heard of her.

06:42.542 --> 06:44.959
Alright, listen, jackass..

06:49.542 --> 06:50.583
You want to talk to me

06:50.667 --> 06:52.792
you talk to the club.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.250
I'd think real
hard before you

06:55.333 --> 06:58.250
make your next
move...Shameless.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.959
So much for polite.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.667
Libby Traynor?

07:15.750 --> 07:17.125
That's me.

07:17.208 --> 07:18.500
You looking for highlights?

07:18.583 --> 07:19.959
Looking for information.

07:20.041 --> 07:23.000
You recognize
anyone in this photo?

07:23.083 --> 07:24.500
(Libby)
Freedom Run?

07:24.583 --> 07:26.834
Can't say I
remember that one.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.667
Well, took a look
into your record, Libby.

07:28.750 --> 07:31.041
Uh, hung around with
the Jackals Motorcycle Club

07:31.125 --> 07:32.208
back in the '70s.

07:32.291 --> 07:35.083
I wound up marrying
one of those idiots.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.834
Got killed on
a bike in '81.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.250
Best thing that
ever happened to me.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.917
Bygone days.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.083
I bought this salon,
left all that behind.

07:45.166 --> 07:47.458
Now I own three
of them in
Philly.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.083
What about Sarah Blake?

07:49.166 --> 07:50.875
Remember her?

07:50.959 --> 07:52.500
Her old man got
in trouble, right?

07:52.583 --> 07:54.875
About 30 years' worth of it.

07:54.959 --> 07:57.417
Prissy brats at school
turned on her..

07:57.500 --> 07:59.250
'...treating her
like she was dirt.'

07:59.959 --> 08:00.917
There was nothing left

08:01.000 --> 08:02.250
for Sarah but the outcasts.

08:18.709 --> 08:20.917
Ah, dirt-bag Kegger.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.250
Oh! Warm beer.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.542
I mean, there
has got to be

08:25.625 --> 08:27.041
a better party
than this
somewhere.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.750
And with ice.

08:28.834 --> 08:30.250
Just...just
another minute.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.959
I gotta find Libby.

08:32.041 --> 08:33.500
(Sarah)
'Oh, uh, there she is.'

08:34.709 --> 08:36.917
Sarah! Can't
believe
you showed up.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.208
Libby, did they expel you?

08:39.291 --> 08:41.125
Don't care. Got a place to stay.

08:41.208 --> 08:43.792
This is better.
Screw 'em,
right?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.083
Wow.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.083
Hardtail.

08:51.166 --> 08:53.208
'65 Panhead.

08:53.291 --> 08:54.333
Rigid.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.834
I built
the pipes myself.

08:57.917 --> 08:59.291
It's beautiful.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.333
Yeah, nothing like
it in the world.

09:04.917 --> 09:06.959
That's the
midnight
howl, citizens!

09:07.041 --> 09:09.125
You're now officially
on Jackal time!

09:09.208 --> 09:12.000
So, if you ain't patched
MC
or property of the MC

09:12.083 --> 09:14.333
time to get lost is right now.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.500
(male #1)
Except you, darling.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.208
You can stay.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.500
We're
leaving,
Sarah. Now.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.333
Hell of a party.

09:39.417 --> 09:42.792
Don't think I saw her much
after
that. Not really her crowd.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.750
Guy she was talking
to with the bike..

09:45.834 --> 09:47.041
...he the one
in this photo?

09:47.125 --> 09:48.417
People came and went.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.333
But what about
this boyfriend

09:50.417 --> 09:52.208
the one who pulled her away?

09:52.291 --> 09:54.250
Possessive jerk from school.

09:54.333 --> 09:58.083
Mark...something.
Guy was a tool.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.834
- Smacking her around.
- How do you know?

10:00.917 --> 10:02.750
Two things I
know, sweetheart

10:02.834 --> 10:06.417
hair, and guys who
like to hit women.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.458
Only one of 'em I can fix.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.166
(Nick)
'Nice-looking bunch.'

10:11.250 --> 10:13.875
Like a group photo from
the Scumbag Glee Club.

10:13.959 --> 10:16.333
Well, Shameless was
sergeant-at-arms of the
Jackals.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.959
'Took over the club when the
president got killed on a
bike.'

10:19.041 --> 10:20.792
New regime got
a lot more violent.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.417
No matches for
the Philly Jackals

10:22.500 --> 10:23.959
crossing with
Colin Blake in the pen.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.208
A hunt down
hang-arounds, ex-affiliates

10:26.291 --> 10:27.959
any insiders
with an ax to grind?

10:28.041 --> 10:29.208
Club women, maybe.

10:29.291 --> 10:30.500
Only considered useful

10:30.583 --> 10:31.875
for sex
and running drugs.

10:31.959 --> 10:33.583
Nice names, come
in as a "Sweet butt"

10:33.667 --> 10:36.375
and work your way up to "Sheep"
and graduate to "Old lady."

10:36.458 --> 10:38.583
Sarah went in with a blind
eye towards her place

10:38.667 --> 10:41.125
in the pecking order.
Could have got ugly.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.291
What about this kid Mark
who brought her to the party?

10:43.375 --> 10:45.959
- Will's talking to him now.
- 'Libby was right.'

10:46.041 --> 10:48.959
Mark Callahan picked up
a sheet for assault in college

10:49.041 --> 10:51.542
slapping around
an ex-girlfriend.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.917
- This gonna take long?
- Somewhere you got to be?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.166
Deposition in
a beep-beep case at
two.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.250
Car accident.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.542
Korean guy blows a stop sign

11:06.625 --> 11:09.083
sideswipes my client
into a flower stand.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.333
Everybody's suing everybody.

11:11.417 --> 11:12.375
Damn mess.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.375
Civil litigation.

11:14.458 --> 11:15.625
Takes a special breed.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.083
Balls of steel, my friend.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.458
Nothing else will do.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.208
You said this was
about Sarah Blake.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.959
You two have
a thing back in '76?

11:26.041 --> 11:27.834
Hooked up in
high school.

11:27.917 --> 11:29.750
Long time ago.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.083
What happened,
she dump you?

11:31.166 --> 11:32.709
[scoffs]
Please.

11:32.792 --> 11:33.792
'Right.'

11:33.875 --> 11:34.875
'You don't get dumped.'

11:34.959 --> 11:36.125
Girlfriend tried it in college.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.000
Campus security had
to pull you off of her.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.500
Not the way
I remember
it.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.750
'Cops talked to you in
'76 after Sarah's death.'

11:41.834 --> 11:43.917
Didn't bother to mention
taking her to parties

11:44.000 --> 11:46.750
with the local
motorcycle gang.

11:50.834 --> 11:54.250
Sarah was the one who
was into those dirt
bags.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.709
Not me.

12:00.834 --> 12:04.250
Hardtail '65 Panhead.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.834
A beauty and a love for bikes.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.417
What are you doing here?

12:11.750 --> 12:15.375
I saw the way you were looking
at my bike at the party.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.250
I know that look.

12:17.333 --> 12:20.250
Oh, you do, huh?

12:20.333 --> 12:22.125
That's the look of somebody
who wants to take off

12:22.208 --> 12:23.458
and tell everyone
to go to hell.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.458
Leave all this behind.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.125
Think you can
help me with
that?

12:31.333 --> 12:33.083
I know I can.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.625
Wow. Bro, that-that's beautiful.

12:39.709 --> 12:43.667
That is truly
beautiful, Casanova.

12:43.750 --> 12:46.333
That is some really
top-dollar BS there.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.542
Mark, I told you
to leave me alone.

12:54.291 --> 12:57.041
Oh, looks like you
took a wrong turn, bro.

13:11.250 --> 13:15.792
Never touch a guy's ride...bro.

13:34.959 --> 13:37.291
Had to miss the rest
of the lacrosse
season.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.875
Jaw wired shut,
lost two teeth.

13:39.959 --> 13:42.291
Sarah turns
up dead in '76.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.709
You don't think
to mention this guy?

13:43.792 --> 13:44.875
Stayed out of it.

13:44.959 --> 13:47.000
She made her choice.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.291
Remember a name,
at least?

13:51.375 --> 13:53.625
Yeah. Darren.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.041
Darren what?

13:57.125 --> 13:58.542
Darren who kicked my ass.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.834
Tell you what,
you find that
guy

14:00.917 --> 14:03.542
you better bring
along some backup.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.917
No rap sheet
on Darren.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.417
Whatever he was up to,
he never got caught.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.417
Libby said people came and
went.
Guy was just a hang-around?

14:10.500 --> 14:12.000
(Nick)
'Hang-around wouldn't
be wearing colors.'

14:12.083 --> 14:14.333
- Maybe got the name wrong.
- 'Name's right.'

14:14.417 --> 14:15.625
Jackals' clubhouse
was part of

14:15.709 --> 14:17.917
a repair shop owned
by Martin Malloy.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.458
Founding president
of the Philly Jackals.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.083
(Scotty)
'And Malloy was killed in
'74.'

14:21.166 --> 14:22.959
Left the clubhouse to his son

14:23.041 --> 14:24.792
who then signed
it over in trust

14:24.875 --> 14:27.083
'to the Jackals
Motorcycle Club.'

14:27.166 --> 14:29.125
- Darren Malloy.
- Son of a Jackal.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.583
(Nick)
'So Sarah wasn't hopping'

14:30.667 --> 14:32.458
on the bike behind
some hang-around kid.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.750
She was...riding
straight into

14:34.834 --> 14:37.375
'the Jackals' inner circle.'

14:37.458 --> 14:39.542
The kid didn't know
what she was getting into.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.959
Quite an operation, Darren.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.333
(Darren)
'Turn around two
custom rides a week'

14:54.417 --> 14:55.792
Fifty grand a pop.

14:55.875 --> 14:58.291
- Yuppie choppers.
- 99 Percenters.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.959
Everybody wants
a piece of the road.

15:00.041 --> 15:03.041
Well, quite a step up from
the garage your dad owned.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.083
Jackals.

15:04.166 --> 15:05.875
Stole it out
from under me.

15:05.959 --> 15:08.291
- Made me sign it over to
them.
- 'That don't seem right.'

15:08.375 --> 15:11.041
You being blood to one
of the original ten.

15:13.834 --> 15:15.291
That's me, but I
wasn't one of them.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.917
(Lilly)
'Not the way your
patch tells it.'

15:17.000 --> 15:19.208
Son of the founder
of the Jackals MC.

15:19.291 --> 15:20.834
That didn't mean
nothing to them.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.875
Dad got killed,
just meant I had to

15:22.959 --> 15:24.208
work harder
to prove myself.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.250
I wasn't allowed
to wear the logo patch.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.875
My dad's jacket,
they tore it off

15:28.959 --> 15:30.667
said I had to
earn my colors.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.333
Even though
you were a legacy?

15:32.417 --> 15:33.667
Still just a prospect.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.709
Pretty much meant
I was their bitch.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.083
Considered me
"righteous" 'cause I knew

15:37.166 --> 15:38.667
how to fix bikes,
like my dad.

15:38.750 --> 15:39.709
So, why the break?

15:39.792 --> 15:42.125
I wasn't cut out
for that life.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.625
Way too rough for me.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.458
I was never as
hardcore as they were

15:45.542 --> 15:46.667
and they never let me forget it.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.583
That's not how
Mark Callahan tells it.

15:48.667 --> 15:49.875
(Lilly)
'Remember him?'

15:49.959 --> 15:51.083
Worked him over with a chain

15:51.166 --> 15:52.959
behind Blessed Trinity?

15:54.750 --> 15:56.709
Yeah, I went after that kid.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.208
He was bigger than me,
I didn't wanna get my

15:59.291 --> 16:00.709
ass kicked in front of Sarah.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.041
Well, gotta wonder
what's
a nice girl like Sarah

16:03.125 --> 16:05.417
doing with a biker
thug like you,
Darren?

16:05.500 --> 16:07.000
My dad got killed on a bike.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.333
Her dad was gone.

16:09.417 --> 16:12.208
We just kinda found each other.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.333
Man, she loved to ride.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.709
Thought it was
about me, but she was..

16:17.792 --> 16:19.375
...looking for more
than a boyfriend.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.875
So you brought her
to the Jackals.

16:21.959 --> 16:23.458
Jackals came
with a dark side

16:23.542 --> 16:26.333
and she was wearing
blinders to it.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.750
I can't believe you made me
ride this garbage wagon, man.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.542
- What gives?
- That's what gives, junior.

16:57.709 --> 16:58.750
Hey.

17:00.041 --> 17:01.834
You had me running that
crap without telling me?

17:01.917 --> 17:03.959
C'mon, what the hell, man?

17:06.333 --> 17:09.208
Don't you ever question us

17:09.291 --> 17:11.333
in front of
some sweet butt.

17:11.417 --> 17:12.709
Understand?

17:12.792 --> 17:13.959
Ever.

17:14.041 --> 17:16.083
I got it.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.417
Good.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.917
You gotta earn
your keep, prospect.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.125
You gotta run this
package up to Pittsburgh

17:23.208 --> 17:24.542
represent the Jackals.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.959
Got a problem with that?

17:29.083 --> 17:31.417
- No.
- Get your ass on the road.

17:33.959 --> 17:36.917
Hey, hey...I'm
gonna get you home.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.792
- Get you out of this.
- Home?

17:38.875 --> 17:40.291
(Sarah)
'What home would that be?'

17:41.291 --> 17:42.250
I think I'm gonna stay.

17:43.750 --> 17:44.875
You don't get it, Sarah.

17:44.959 --> 17:46.458
These guys are
running felony weight.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.291
Everybody's a criminal.

17:48.375 --> 17:50.458
At least the
Jackals
are up-front about
it.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.709
Sarah!

17:54.792 --> 17:57.625
Nobody cares what my
father did here, Darren.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.375
At least I know
where I stand.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.709
You just left her there?

18:08.792 --> 18:11.542
That whole scene was
just too much for me.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.166
I never made that
run to Pittsburgh.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.125
But Sarah
wanted to
stay?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
This guy
with the
knife..

18:18.083 --> 18:21.000
Monster. Shameless'
chief enforcer.

18:21.083 --> 18:24.667
Sadistic son of a bitch.
He loved to get his hands
dirty.

18:26.291 --> 18:30.083
I'm tellin' you, the-the guy
has a place for everything.

18:30.959 --> 18:32.000
Except you.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.166
Mm.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.834
Situation's about
to get critical

18:34.917 --> 18:37.333
at Casa Jeffries.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.250
If I could just...think
of somewhere else to stay.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.041
Dude, been working
together what, forever?

18:43.125 --> 18:45.125
Just ask, man.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.959
So, can I crash at
your place for awhile?

18:49.375 --> 18:51.792
- No.
- No?

18:51.875 --> 18:53.375
[sniffles]
No.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.000
Scotty, what's the
story
on this "Monster?"

18:56.083 --> 18:57.834
Was the chief
enforcer of the Jackals

18:57.917 --> 18:59.375
but we got no
jacket on him at all.

18:59.458 --> 19:02.875
No name, no arrests,
no prison, nothin'.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.166
Don't make sense.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.166
I had my guy at the state
police run the name

19:06.250 --> 19:08.125
see if we get a hit.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.375
Got something
with Colin.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.709
Storage room
trustee
at FCI Allenwood

19:11.792 --> 19:14.041
was a former Jackal.
Pittsburgh chapter.

19:14.125 --> 19:15.333
(Scotty)
'You recognize the guy?'

19:15.417 --> 19:16.667
Burke?

19:16.750 --> 19:19.542
Never said anything
to me about being a biker.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.208
Got popped in
'88
for kidnapping

19:21.291 --> 19:22.583
and murdering a drug dealer.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.959
Met him on his first day in.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.500
Knew the guy 20 years.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.875
And he knew this was killing me.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.166
Why didn't he just tell me?

19:29.250 --> 19:30.250
Probably scared.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.250
He's helping you now.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.583
He could know more.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.834
If he knows who killed Sarah..

19:38.125 --> 19:41.625
Well, Burke's been in
Allenwood a long time.

19:41.709 --> 19:43.917
Bet he'd love
having some visitors.

19:48.834 --> 19:51.709
Oh, man, what the hell is this?

19:51.792 --> 19:54.083
No doc today,
Burke, just us cops.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.458
Here about a photo you
dropped on Colin Blake.

19:56.542 --> 19:58.417
His dead daughter with
your motorcycle crew.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.125
I don't know
anything
about that photo.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.250
And I don't appreciate you
ambushing my clinic time.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.083
Well, how about I pretend
I'm your proctologist

20:04.166 --> 20:06.208
and shove my foot up your ass?

20:06.291 --> 20:09.375
Come on, Burke, Jackals sold
you out, let you rot in here.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.959
(Nick)
Sold you out for
killing a drug dealer.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.875
- That's cold.
- Yeah.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.125
Some tweaker I kept
in my storage shed

20:17.208 --> 20:18.500
till he gave up his stash.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.458
You know, I...I pass out.

20:20.542 --> 20:23.125
I forgot about him a couple
of days, he winds up dead.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.500
- Heatstroke.
- Oops.

20:24.583 --> 20:25.959
(Burke)
'The bastards sold me out'

20:26.041 --> 20:27.709
'when the feds
started sniffing around'

20:27.792 --> 20:30.000
protect their
precious drug
trade.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.917
This is two weeks after
the photo you dropped on
Colin.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.458
- 'Wanted you to look closer?'
- 'Guy got you out of the
hole.'

20:35.542 --> 20:38.458
Jackals didn't help
you out, Colin did.

20:38.542 --> 20:41.083
You know something,
give the man some peace.

20:45.709 --> 20:49.917
I took that shot at
the Bicentennial
Run.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.834
Pretty girl on a bike,
somethin' to remember.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.250
You see her after that?

20:53.333 --> 20:55.583
Yeah, just one time.

20:55.667 --> 20:58.291
I was in Philly as a
connection
for the Pittsburgh boys.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.875
- Where?
- Clubhouse.

21:02.291 --> 21:03.875
She tried to act tough,
but it was obvious

21:03.959 --> 21:05.250
the kid didn't belong there.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.333
(Monster)
'She's jailbait,
man, look at her.'

21:11.417 --> 21:13.083
'She's just like
all the other sheep'

21:13.166 --> 21:15.834
expecting a free ride,
offering nothing up.

21:15.917 --> 21:18.834
What is it you're
doing here, princess?

21:18.917 --> 21:20.417
What is it you
want me to do?

21:20.500 --> 21:22.458
(Shameless)
'We're gettin' jacked
by the fuzz every time'

21:22.542 --> 21:24.750
we roll colors
outside the gate.

21:25.875 --> 21:28.041
Need somebody who
won't attract attention.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.208
I'll do it.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.709
Carry the package for you.

21:36.792 --> 21:38.875
Wherever you need it to go.

21:41.917 --> 21:43.458
Listen to the prom queen.

21:43.542 --> 21:44.917
But you gotta be
straight with me.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.750
If I'm carrying,
I gotta know what it
is

21:47.834 --> 21:49.500
what to expect
when I get
there.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.834
Oh, and no surprises.

22:03.208 --> 22:04.792
You got a deal.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.041
It's about time
you started pullin'

22:07.125 --> 22:08.417
your weight around here.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.875
Girl had guts..

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
...and Monster
didn't like that.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.417
At the time
she turned up dead

22:19.500 --> 22:21.125
Monster had lit out.

22:21.208 --> 22:22.291
Left the club?

22:22.375 --> 22:24.792
Nobody ever heard
from him again.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.000
See, MC's real particular

22:26.083 --> 22:28.917
about who you
can and can't kill.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.291
Believe me, I'd know.
She was useful.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.208
Shameless wanted
that girl alive.

22:33.291 --> 22:34.542
You saying
Monster killed
her?

22:34.625 --> 22:36.959
Explain why he disappeared.

22:37.041 --> 22:38.583
Maybe he hauled
ass and maybe

22:38.667 --> 22:41.792
Shameless killed
him as an example.

22:41.875 --> 22:44.083
Either way, good riddance.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.000
Excuse me. Looking for Will.

22:51.083 --> 22:53.500
- Will Jeffries?
- He here?

22:57.834 --> 22:59.375
Will?

22:59.458 --> 23:00.750
Who knows?

23:00.834 --> 23:02.709
Staties found
our Monster.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.208
<i>alias?</i>

23:05.291 --> 23:09.208
Better. Monster's real
name was James Drew.

23:09.291 --> 23:12.583
Chief enforcer for
the Jackals Motorcycle Club.

23:12.667 --> 23:14.291
(Lilly)
'Monster..'

23:14.375 --> 23:16.583
...was a cop.

23:20.875 --> 23:23.625
(Lilly)
'There we go.'

23:31.250 --> 23:34.333
James Drew,
Philly PD.

23:34.417 --> 23:35.709
(Scotty)
Easy.

23:35.792 --> 23:38.792
Well, you dropped
pretty far off the grid..

23:38.875 --> 23:40.208
...Monster.

23:46.917 --> 23:49.875
I haven't heard the name
Monster in a long time.

23:49.959 --> 23:51.458
Be about
'76,
I guess.

23:51.542 --> 23:52.917
Undercover inside
the most violent

23:53.000 --> 23:54.667
motorcycle club in Philly,
then all of a sudden

23:54.750 --> 23:56.000
you drop off
the face of the Earth?

23:56.083 --> 23:59.125
Blacked out your
tats.
Not a Jackal, not a
cop.

23:59.208 --> 24:00.834
So what are you, Monster?

24:00.917 --> 24:03.083
I didn't want their
mark on me anymore.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.709
What happened?
What drove you out?

24:04.792 --> 24:06.583
Shameless
invited
me to prospect

24:06.667 --> 24:09.458
into the Jackals
after we served in
'Nam.

24:10.625 --> 24:12.125
Didn't know I'd
hit the academy

24:12.208 --> 24:14.000
in the meantime
got my badge.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.834
First ever investigation

24:15.917 --> 24:18.000
of an outlaw club anybody tried.

24:18.083 --> 24:21.125
Well, easy to get
lost playing both sides.

24:21.208 --> 24:24.041
You ever done
undercover,
detective?

24:24.125 --> 24:28.250
Well, somebody I know, uh...
he's in right now. It's tough.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.875
I were you, I
wouldn't
bet my pension on

24:30.959 --> 24:33.041
ever seeing him again.

24:33.125 --> 24:36.041
Seductive world, power, freedom.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.417
Mostly it was the drugs.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.709
I got hooked
and lost myself in it.

24:41.792 --> 24:43.542
What about Sarah Blake?

24:43.625 --> 24:46.542
[sighs]
Sarah was the reason I left.

24:46.625 --> 24:48.834
- She didn't belong there.
- You knew her.

24:48.917 --> 24:51.625
Girl was jacking
up
my investigation.

24:51.709 --> 24:54.208
Most of those MC
guys were idiots.

24:54.291 --> 24:55.583
She was smart.

24:55.667 --> 24:58.709
And smart was
a liability for me inside.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.542
(Sarah)
'Hello?'

25:12.000 --> 25:13.917
- 'Stupid bitch.'
- Ah!

25:14.000 --> 25:16.166
I told you
you don't belong here.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.291
Think this is a game,
little girl?

25:17.375 --> 25:18.959
I-I got the money
in my car.

25:19.041 --> 25:20.750
D-did everything
just like you told me.

25:20.834 --> 25:22.166
Shameless said
I'd be safe.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.375
Shameless?

25:24.458 --> 25:26.792
Girl, who do you think
put us together alone?

25:29.834 --> 25:32.458
There's only way you got
any value around here.

25:32.542 --> 25:34.583
Ah! No!

25:35.667 --> 25:37.583
I'm not one of your sheep!

25:39.333 --> 25:41.917
You're nothing but an animal.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.834
Sarah, get the hell out of here.

25:56.917 --> 25:58.333
'Now.'

25:58.417 --> 25:59.709
Go!

26:03.041 --> 26:05.792
[exhales heavily]
She was right, I was an
animal.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.291
I got my gear, hopped on my bike

26:08.375 --> 26:10.125
and blew the hell out
of there that night.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.542
You didn't know
Sarah had been killed?

26:12.625 --> 26:14.333
All I could think
about was getting clean

26:14.417 --> 26:16.834
and never look back.

26:16.917 --> 26:19.625
If I had stayed, did my job

26:19.709 --> 26:21.917
she might've had a chance.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.333
I messed up.

26:26.417 --> 26:27.583
When she left that night

26:27.667 --> 26:28.875
know where she was headed?

26:28.959 --> 26:30.875
She was riding
the sofa of some
girl

26:30.959 --> 26:33.875
who was angling to
be Shameless' old
lady.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.333
Libby something.

26:38.417 --> 26:39.917
Libby Traynor.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.583
Real operator, that one.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.375
Cold as ice.

26:45.583 --> 26:46.792
Well, how do we know
you didn't do her in

26:46.875 --> 26:48.458
yourself, Monster?

26:48.542 --> 26:50.208
You don't.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.208
Guess you're gonna
be taking me in.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.583
(Nick)
'Looked hard at
Libby Traynor's financials.'

26:59.667 --> 27:01.208
Hinky all the way down.

27:01.291 --> 27:03.625
The deposit slips don't
jibe
with her account
activity

27:03.709 --> 27:06.083
and tax records don't
jibe with her address.

27:06.166 --> 27:09.041
Well, the DEA shakedown on one
of her shops six years ago.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.959
Popped the manager for
possession with intent.

27:12.041 --> 27:14.125
Down payment on her salon
comes from the same trust

27:14.208 --> 27:16.375
that owns
the Jackals repair
shop.

27:16.458 --> 27:19.458
Starting to sound like a front
for the club's meth trade.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.375
Burke got shanked in his cell.

27:23.458 --> 27:25.375
CO found him
dead this morning.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.542
Jackals are closing ranks.

27:29.625 --> 27:32.250
All we got against
them now is Libby.

27:41.792 --> 27:43.458
(Lilly)
'There she goes.'

27:44.542 --> 27:46.709
Need a reason
to pull her
over.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.917
Well, now we got one.

28:15.083 --> 28:17.458
She have that bag
when she went in?

28:17.542 --> 28:18.834
Nope.

28:18.917 --> 28:21.083
Let her get a few blocks,
then light her up.

28:27.291 --> 28:28.959
You lied to us, Libby.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.917
Jackals are still using
you, after all these years.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.166
Nobody uses me.

28:33.250 --> 28:34.709
'A pound of meth
in that diaper bag.'

28:34.792 --> 28:37.291
Only hair you're gonna be
doing is your cellmate's.

28:37.375 --> 28:39.959
Bring it. I got my people.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.417
Well, Jackals already killed
Burke to protect their
secret.

28:42.500 --> 28:45.625
Think they won't do the same
to a used-up sheep like you?

28:46.458 --> 28:48.083
I'll take my chances.

28:48.166 --> 28:49.208
Don't kid yourself.

28:49.291 --> 28:50.625
'A woman in that club'

28:50.709 --> 28:52.625
'you're property, nothing more.'

28:52.709 --> 28:54.166
Property that can be bought

28:54.250 --> 28:57.125
or sold or eliminated.

28:57.208 --> 28:59.000
Just like that.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.917
You got to set me
up
outside of Philly

29:04.000 --> 29:05.208
away from them.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.709
First, tell me what
happened to Sarah.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.166
- I don't know.
- 'Oh, come on, Libby.'

29:09.250 --> 29:10.583
'She was sleeping on your sofa.'

29:10.667 --> 29:13.250
You knew everything
going on at that club.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.500
Tried to jump the line.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.083
Figured running
drugs for Shameless

29:19.166 --> 29:20.166
would get her in cheap.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.834
Well, compared to what?

29:21.917 --> 29:23.959
The way you and the other
sheep had to pay your dues?

29:24.041 --> 29:26.208
Stupid girl
didn't get
it.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.792
We were part of something.

29:29.875 --> 29:31.166
We were family.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.542
Only hurts the first time.

29:34.625 --> 29:36.792
After that..

29:36.875 --> 29:37.834
...they respect you.

29:37.917 --> 29:39.917
Darren was right.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I don't belong here.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.875
Where you gonna go, sweetie?

29:43.959 --> 29:44.959
Your daddy's mansion?

29:47.041 --> 29:49.208
Jackals are all
you've got left now.

29:50.959 --> 29:53.208
I gotta get out of this, Libby.

29:55.291 --> 29:56.542
You still got Shameless' money.

29:57.959 --> 29:59.542
Pull yourself together.
Take it back.

29:59.625 --> 30:02.709
- 'He'll talk sense into
you.'
- Shameless set me up once.

30:02.792 --> 30:04.291
I'm not going back there.

30:04.375 --> 30:06.709
I'll leave the money here.
You take it to him.

30:06.792 --> 30:08.333
Oh, honey.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.709
Not my mess.

30:11.792 --> 30:12.750
You made it..

30:13.959 --> 30:16.500
...you clean it up.

30:22.208 --> 30:24.041
When she left..

30:24.125 --> 30:25.750
...the look on her face.

30:25.834 --> 30:27.500
I figured she might
do something stupid.

30:27.583 --> 30:28.834
Talk to the cops maybe.

30:28.917 --> 30:30.417
And you called Shameless.

30:30.500 --> 30:33.041
Only thing I could do.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.542
She was going off
the reservation.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.208
With his money.

30:38.291 --> 30:41.583
You're gonna do the right
thing now, Libby. For Sarah.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.834
You're gonna give me
the Jackals, understand?

30:43.917 --> 30:46.291
Or I'm gonna give you to them.

30:56.166 --> 30:57.875
The Jackals hold
their chapter
meetings

30:57.959 --> 30:59.834
at the clubhouse.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.500
Church, they call it.

31:03.583 --> 31:06.667
They kept minutes of
every move they ever made.

31:12.375 --> 31:14.417
Five minutes to sunup.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.458
Ready to roll on these fools?

31:19.542 --> 31:22.208
(Will)
Right behind you.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.291
Let's do this.

31:39.041 --> 31:40.500
- Drop your gun.
- Drop it.

31:40.583 --> 31:42.542
Drop it now!

31:42.625 --> 31:46.625
- 'Clear! All clear!'
- Don't move, don't move.

31:46.709 --> 31:48.000
Detective!

31:56.834 --> 31:59.083
Thirty years of church meetings.

31:59.166 --> 32:00.834
Every detail accounted for.

32:00.917 --> 32:04.041
Every move
the Jackals ever made.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.792
A good read.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.834
Know what I liked the most?

32:09.917 --> 32:12.458
There were surprises.

32:12.542 --> 32:15.208
Digging through
expecting
to nail Shameless down

32:15.291 --> 32:16.583
for Sarah's murder.

32:16.667 --> 32:18.792
But what I found was you.

32:20.083 --> 32:21.375
I told you,
I quit the Jackals.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.166
But not when
you said you
did.

32:23.250 --> 32:26.166
Minutes show you came back
from that Pittsburgh run

32:26.250 --> 32:28.291
the very night
Sarah was
killed.

32:28.375 --> 32:30.000
Also shows you
brought in the
take

32:30.083 --> 32:31.500
'from Sarah's run to New York.'

32:31.583 --> 32:33.917
'Now, how'd you wind up
with her money, Darren?'

32:35.291 --> 32:37.959
You must have
the dates wrong.

32:38.041 --> 32:40.834
You said yourself
you were a
prospect.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.500
And pretty much
their bitch.

32:42.583 --> 32:44.917
'They told you something
needed to be done, you did
it.'

32:45.000 --> 32:47.041
No questions asked.

32:49.625 --> 32:50.750
No, I could
never hurt Sarah.

32:50.834 --> 32:52.208
So maybe you
tried to help
her.

32:52.291 --> 32:55.000
Last time anyone
saw her, she..

32:55.083 --> 32:57.000
...was talking about you.

32:58.291 --> 33:00.166
'Darren, you were
the last person'

33:00.250 --> 33:02.125
'she trusted in the world.'

33:02.208 --> 33:04.333
Don't let her down again.

33:11.125 --> 33:12.667
She called me and said
she was in trouble.

33:21.709 --> 33:23.458
I don't, I don't
know
what to do,
Darren.

33:23.542 --> 33:25.083
I should have listened to you.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.792
Alright, I'm here.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.667
I'll help you.

33:36.750 --> 33:39.625
I still got
Shameless'
money from the run.

33:39.709 --> 33:40.917
I-I-I don't wanna..

33:41.000 --> 33:43.166
can't

33:44.458 --> 33:46.583
W-what am I gonna do?

33:54.750 --> 33:56.792
Sarah, let's run.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.250
You and me.

33:58.333 --> 33:59.542
We don't need
anybody else.

33:59.625 --> 34:02.542
Darren...we-we can't.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.709
There's nothing left
for you here, me either.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.458
Let's just take this money
and go and never look back.

34:07.542 --> 34:10.041
- But my father--
- Is gone.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.291
He let you down.

34:16.834 --> 34:18.208
I won't.

34:18.291 --> 34:20.291
I'll take care of you.

34:22.875 --> 34:25.083
I'll be your family now.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.667
You gotta trust me.

34:36.250 --> 34:40.000
She wouldn't go with me,
so I just...I just rode away.

34:40.083 --> 34:43.250
And took the money
and just...left her
there?

34:43.333 --> 34:46.000
Alone? Nowhere to go?

34:47.375 --> 34:49.458
I-I can't believe
you would do that.

34:50.625 --> 34:53.208
I mean, you cared
about her, right?

34:53.291 --> 34:55.375
Yes, I cared about her.

34:56.750 --> 35:00.709
So, she climbed up
behind you on that
bike

35:01.458 --> 35:03.250
and you rode away.

35:04.583 --> 35:06.125
And then what happened?

35:06.208 --> 35:09.041
Did you realize how
much
trouble you were in?

35:09.125 --> 35:12.083
Only way to save
yourself from the
Jackals

35:12.166 --> 35:14.291
to redeem yourself..

35:14.375 --> 35:16.000
...take care of
the problem for
them.

35:16.083 --> 35:17.417
No.

35:18.709 --> 35:22.041
I would never,
ever hurt her.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.333
Then who did?

35:25.959 --> 35:28.667
(Scotty)
'You don't gotta
talk, Shameless.'

35:30.333 --> 35:31.709
We'll lay it out for you.

35:31.792 --> 35:34.000
(Will)
'Got testimony
from ex-affiliates'

35:34.083 --> 35:36.375
about 30 years of
methamphetamine trade

35:36.458 --> 35:38.709
a-across three states.

35:38.792 --> 35:40.041
'That makes it federal time.'

35:40.125 --> 35:41.500
Got your club minutes

35:41.583 --> 35:44.500
<i>stupid,</i>
illegal-ass activity

35:44.583 --> 35:46.709
you and your buddies
ever engaged in.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.041
(Will)
'Real smooth, Jack.'

35:48.125 --> 35:49.750
Well, we love
stuff in
writing.

35:49.834 --> 35:51.625
And we got
your old prospect

35:51.709 --> 35:53.041
Darren Malloy,
in the next room

35:53.125 --> 35:54.709
'giving you up for
Sarah Blake's murder.'

35:54.792 --> 35:57.417
Only ride you're
gonna be taking
now..

35:57.500 --> 35:58.875
...is upstate.

36:00.041 --> 36:01.750
Punk will never sing.

36:01.834 --> 36:04.208
- No?
- Prospect or not.

36:05.208 --> 36:08.375
No Jackal talks to cops.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.583
Oh, yeah.

36:10.667 --> 36:13.333
You know everything
about the Jackals, right?

36:13.417 --> 36:15.750
Everything worth knowing.

36:20.709 --> 36:22.000
Recognize him?

36:25.458 --> 36:27.750
(Scotty)
'That's your boy, Monster.'

36:28.625 --> 36:30.750
Your sergeant at arms.

36:30.834 --> 36:32.250
You know he was
state police?

36:32.333 --> 36:33.625
(Will)
'You brought him
into the club.'

36:33.709 --> 36:36.625
Vouched for a cop,
across the board.

36:36.709 --> 36:40.250
Man...rest of the MC
finds out about that

36:40.333 --> 36:43.500
'it's gonna be a cold winter
watching your back in
gen-pop.'

36:43.583 --> 36:46.750
See, you know everything
about the Jackals..

36:48.041 --> 36:50.208
...and now, so do we.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.083
Want to take
bets on your
boy

36:53.166 --> 36:55.250
Darren keeping
his lid on?

36:58.750 --> 37:01.709
You walked away from the
job
before, and a girl died.

37:03.333 --> 37:06.375
- Time for you to make it
right.
- What do you want?

37:06.458 --> 37:09.333
Tell me everything
Shameless knows about Darren.

37:16.750 --> 37:19.542
Well, Shameless
sold you out,
Darren.

37:19.625 --> 37:21.333
Shameless?

37:23.709 --> 37:25.458
No way, never.

37:27.333 --> 37:30.208
Your first bike
was a Sportster
883

37:30.291 --> 37:33.208
'cause you were too
scrawny to handle an
FLH.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.417
A bitch bike.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.709
That was no bitch bike.

37:37.792 --> 37:38.834
It was beautiful.

37:38.917 --> 37:40.375
And when your
father got
killed

37:40.458 --> 37:42.208
you ran to Shameless.

37:42.291 --> 37:44.709
You cried on
his shoulder.

37:46.208 --> 37:49.166
Remember what he
told you, Darren?

37:49.250 --> 37:52.000
What he said?

37:52.083 --> 37:54.250
He said, "Look around.

37:55.750 --> 37:58.667
Every Jackal in this
room is your father now."

37:58.750 --> 38:01.041
Said they were gonna
raise you to have
class.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.500
You never cried
again, did you?

38:08.834 --> 38:11.291
Until the night
you killed
Sarah.

38:27.291 --> 38:29.625
We were gonna run away together.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.667
Just the two of us.

38:35.291 --> 38:37.291
She trusted me.

38:42.208 --> 38:44.500
But I let her down.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.917
Because I was a coward.

39:37.583 --> 39:40.125
Off the bike, prospect.

39:40.208 --> 39:42.417
Your back warmer too.

39:48.792 --> 39:50.792
Let's go, move.

39:58.959 --> 40:01.583
Thought you and your sheep could
just light out with my money?

40:02.625 --> 40:03.500
Shameless, wait.

40:03.583 --> 40:06.375
Your old man
would be ashamed.

40:06.458 --> 40:08.709
He'd knock you on your
ass, if he were alive.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.458
Shameless, we were gonna
bring you the money.

40:14.542 --> 40:15.542
I was on my way to see--

40:15.625 --> 40:18.000
You're right.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.750
Last I checked, West Chester
Pike leads away from my door.

40:21.834 --> 40:23.333
No, I-I-I was gonna come--

40:23.417 --> 40:26.041
Hey, hey, hey,
it's alright.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.583
You're not the first brother
led astray by a woman.

40:35.208 --> 40:37.542
Won't happen again, though.

40:42.458 --> 40:44.333
Go get my
shovel, prospect.

40:48.875 --> 40:51.125
- 'Darren.'
- Now!

40:56.125 --> 40:59.000
(Sarah)
Darren. Darren, please.

41:03.166 --> 41:04.625
'Help me, Darren.'

41:09.625 --> 41:11.500
Darren, Darren?

41:16.000 --> 41:16.959
'Darren!'

41:17.041 --> 41:19.709
Don't let them do this!

41:19.792 --> 41:21.375
Darren!

41:21.458 --> 41:22.917
'Darren!'

41:25.959 --> 41:28.375
'Darren!'

41:30.458 --> 41:31.917
'Darren!'
