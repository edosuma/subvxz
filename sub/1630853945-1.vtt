-[sara] oh, yeah.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.948
-[jake] holy smokes!
-[sara] oh, my god!

09:43.016 --> 09:45.617
-Painful.
-[jake] you want
a piggyback?

09:45.619 --> 09:46.851
[sara] oh, my god.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.322
[jake] yeah, it hurts.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.657
[sara] here again,
I am so sorry.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.859
[waz] if you go in
the footprints,
it's gonna be a little bit

09:54.961 --> 09:56.061
Better for you, but...

09:57.631 --> 09:59.431
I think it gets better
right up here.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.200
We get under some trees.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.803
[sara] <i> the cold is terrifyin</i>
<i> to me.</i>

10:04.805 --> 10:08.039
I mean, the wind's ripping at,
like, 30 miles an hour.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.541
Oh, my god,
I'm in so much pain.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.110
Oh, my god!

10:13.213 --> 10:15.113
Like, I'm in so much pain.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.248
Oh!

10:21.855 --> 10:23.321
[sarah] oh, man.
This is tough.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.357
Hey, did you guys see
that big ass rock right there?

10:25.425 --> 10:26.758
-Yeah.
-Is that us?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.627
If we get behind it,
we get out of this wind
for a second.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.261
-[sarah] all right.
-[wes] that'll help us.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.698
[sarah] oh, man!

10:33.700 --> 10:36.334
-[wes] we get
on the other side of this.
-[sarah] yep, we'll be golden.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.837
-We could stop,
take a look at the map again.
-[wes] yeah.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.605
[sarah] formulate a game plan.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.674
-Check this out.
-[jermaine] oh, yeah.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.010
There's like a nest in here.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.978
-All this.
-[jermaine] nice and--

10:46.980 --> 10:49.347
-This is dry.
-Good!

10:49.449 --> 10:50.849
In the bag.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.551
-[wes] good find.
-Let's grab all of this
out of here.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.920
[wes] okay, tell you what, oh!

10:55.922 --> 10:58.289
[jermaine] uh!
Get on the other side
of the rock fast.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.624
[wes] ahhh!

10:59.626 --> 11:01.059
-This side of the rock.
-Don't have to ask me twice.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.128
[wes] let's check that map.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.396
[sarah] there's the rock.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.898
-And there's
the shelter location.
-We're gonna have to just cut

11:06.900 --> 11:09.334
Across down here 'cause
there's fish, there's water.

11:09.436 --> 11:13.338
-And that's resources
for making a decent shelter.
-[jermaine] absolutely.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.640
-We need, we need to seek
shelter right now. [laughs]
-that's my priority.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.575
-Let's go do it.
Let's go get fire.
-And lots of firewood.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.277
[sarah] all right.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.047
[wes] <i> if we don't get</i>
<i> out of the wind</i>
<i> and stay warm over a fire,</i>

11:22.049 --> 11:24.349
We're not gonna make
it through this challenge.

11:24.418 --> 11:28.053
-[sarah] that wind! [laughs]
-[screams] oh!

11:28.955 --> 11:29.954
[grunts]

11:30.991 --> 11:33.058
-[jermaine] whoo!
-Damn.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.061
Hey, watch your footsteps.
Let's double time,
guys, it's cold.

11:37.330 --> 11:42.600
-Ah! Whoo! [shrieks]
-[grunts]

11:43.737 --> 11:44.836
[exhales]

11:49.609 --> 11:50.709
[rod] my feet hurt.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.245
[jeremy] it's needles
I'm walking on.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.714
[trish] there's briars
everywhere.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.582
You know there's one thing
with the briars

11:57.584 --> 12:00.518
And there's another thing when
you feet are frozen and you're
stepping through briars.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.420
[trish] yeah,
you don't feel them.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.057
Hey, somebody's got
blood on their feet already.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.058
[trish] uh-oh!

12:07.928 --> 12:10.428
We gotta get to the tree.
That's it.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.664
[jeremy] thinking about
just kicking it in gear.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.532
You're not getting out
this snow.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.202
[trish] there's not a whole
lot of other options.

12:17.204 --> 12:20.538
All right, jeremy.
I'm following you, brother.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.941
-[trish] let's go!
Come on, rod.
-[rod grunts]

12:22.943 --> 12:24.109
I'm coming.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.419
-Just get out of this wind
for a few minutes.
-Yeah.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.754
It gets southside now.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.857
Oh, sun!

12:38.925 --> 12:41.025
-[wes] yeah, buddy!
-Oh, give me sun!

12:41.695 --> 12:45.363
Oh! Hey. Look at that.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.099
-[sarah] what the heck!
-[wes] ooh, kidding me?
Come on.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.834
Oh, man!

12:49.936 --> 12:51.903
If I see what I think I see...

12:51.905 --> 12:54.405
-[wes] sweet mary and joseph.
-[jermaine] peanut butter
and jelly time.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.740
[wes] oh, buddy!

12:55.842 --> 12:57.575
-[sarah laughs]
-[wes] oh!

12:57.577 --> 13:00.111
-Oh, I see something
really nice in there.
-[jermaine] oh!

13:00.113 --> 13:02.147
[narrator] <i> in these</i>
<i> frigid conditions,</i>

13:02.215 --> 13:04.415
<i> Each team is given</i>

13:04.417 --> 13:06.518
Looks like an abandoned
shelter up here.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.619
[narrator] <i> animal pelts.</i>

13:07.621 --> 13:08.920

13:12.926 --> 13:15.426

-[sarah and wes] yeah.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.028
-Let's get going.
-[jermaine] let's get going.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.964
-[sarah] okay. Yeah, I do.
-You got a blade there?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.933
[sarah] <i> I work professionall</i>
<i> as a taxidermist</i>

13:21.935 --> 13:26.404
<i> And the side part of that</i>

13:27.707 --> 13:29.607
-Pretty warm.
-[sarah] way colder than I am.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.411
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm good.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.314
[jermaine] cool.
The design looks like,
it's very native.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.249
[sarah] it does look
very indigenous.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.417
Pretty sure this
is kind of like

13:39.419 --> 13:41.653
A modified version
of a hogan shelter.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.522
So, the style of shelter that
we have is a hogan-style
shelter

13:44.524 --> 13:48.226
That would've been the type
used by indigenous cultures
in this area

13:48.228 --> 13:52.230
<i> And I am very impressed</i>
<i> with the technology that</i>
<i> they developed.</i>

13:52.232 --> 13:55.400
[narrator] <i> the sturdy</i>
<i> framework of this modified</i>
<i> winter hogan</i>

13:55.402 --> 13:58.636

14:02.409 --> 14:05.009
-And it's gonna do just fine
for us, I can tell you that.
-Yeah!

14:05.011 --> 14:07.846
Currently, the top priority
is getting a fire going.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.682
The shelter is not sufficient
as it stands.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.151
The hides are not gonna
do it alone.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.854
So, we're gonna have to get
all three of these components
coming together.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.155
Let's get to fire-making.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.123
Okay.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.101
Guys, we need to get the cut.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.136
-Yeah, sure do. Let's get a...
-Yeah, my feet's getting numb.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.838
[rod] shoes,
we gotta get shoes, guys.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.308
I was just looking down
at my feet and they are
turning purple.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.011
-[trish] yeah, they are a--
-[rod] shoes are
the first and foremost.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.747
[trish] yeah, we gotta get
these feet covered.

14:42.849 --> 14:47.552
Yeah, my concern coming into
this challenge was
the circulation in my feet.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.554
-I mean, you can feel how
cold they are.
-[trish] yeah, they're cold.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.957

are blue. Purple.

something or my feet's--

[trish] yeah, they sure are.
Your toes are not good.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.649
[jeremy] argh! My feet
are gone.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.417
My right one,
I can't even feel it.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.853
[exhales] [bleep]

15:32.832 --> 15:35.199
If you can see
those trees over there,
those ten-foot high ones?

15:35.201 --> 15:36.701
If I take 'em off the ground
level and we just

15:36.703 --> 15:38.836
-Laid 'em out and make
that a part of the shelter?
-Make a...

15:38.938 --> 15:41.506
-And that's...
-Yeah, yeah.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.742

other [bleep] but no,
I think it's perfect.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.612
Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna
hold it tight for you,
so it's easy to chop.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.915
-If I hurt you, then I would
feel really sad.
-Not bounce it.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.617
Chop all the way down there.
It's not gonna hurt me.

15:54.421 --> 15:58.456

-you don't have to chop
between my fingers.

<i> Throughout my previous</i>

<i> the most difficult aspect</i>

17:28.181 --> 17:29.313
<i> Was staying warm.</i>

17:30.917 --> 17:33.251
It's really cold.
Or at least, I am.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.360
And hopefully, it keeps going,
the rain doesn't put it out.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.430
I think one of the things
that I would like to get
out of this challenge is just

17:45.432 --> 17:46.998
<i> Knowing that I can do this.</i>

17:47.000 --> 17:49.400

-[waz] you definitely want
to have a, a big pile.
-[sara] a bigger pile, yeah.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.411
[waz] that'd be sure,
that stuff would kick
that one off.

that smoke, that first little
smell of that fire.

19:13.019 --> 19:16.120
<i> Branches and enough</i>
<i> to keep the hides from</i>

19:23.963 --> 19:25.663
You look wild, woman.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.399
-Yeah, you, right back at you.
-[both laugh]

19:28.401 --> 19:31.702
[ky] all right, I'm gonna
start getting some of these
branches down and, uh...

19:31.704 --> 19:35.406
I'm gonna look for um,
dead wood, see if there's
anything laying around.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.908
-[ky] perfect.
-[gabby] like, that one
to your left.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.509
-Yeah.
-[gabby] mmm-hmm.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.012
Just a matter of figuring out

19:41.014 --> 19:43.581
Which branches are gonna
be best to

19:43.583 --> 19:45.216
Thread into our shelter.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.053
Oh, it's gonna get really,
really frigid out here.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.957
Yeah.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.959
One thing I forgot up here.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.727
Air's thinner,
you get tired a lot quicker.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.963
<i> Just gotta remember</i>
<i> to slow down.</i>

19:59.933 --> 20:01.999
<i> First time I came out here,</i>

20:02.001 --> 20:04.035
<i> I just went, you know,</i>
<i> pedal to the metal.</i>

20:04.136 --> 20:07.605
You get so fatigued
so quickly and so dehydrated.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.608
You know, you don't
even realize it's happening
before too late.

20:10.610 --> 20:14.612
[narrator] <i> even though</i>
<i> joe completed his first</i>

20:14.614 --> 20:17.148

20:17.217 --> 20:19.417
I need a minute, I feel sick.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.853
Oh, yeah. I need to sit down,
I'm feeling really,
really lightheaded.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.423
Oh, wow.
That came on suddenly.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.125
[narrator] <i> ky's track recor</i>

cat tracks here.
-[ky] yeah?

20:50.449 --> 20:52.149
That's pretty close
to camp.

20:52.218 --> 20:55.119
I think a fire is gonna
be important to deter them.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.188
Looks like they're following
the deer.

20:57.190 --> 21:00.858
[ky] wow! Oh, well.
At least, maybe they got
a good meal.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.729
-[joe] oh! Hey, guys!
-[ky] heya!

21:05.531 --> 21:07.465
[joe] we got bones
over here.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.501
And there's definitely
a prevalent game trail
next to us here, too.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.236
[gabby] oh, there's a lot
of bone.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.606
Still hair on this,

21:16.309 --> 21:18.209
Still flesh on this.

21:18.211 --> 21:21.445
Um, I don't think this
is a victim of the cold.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.715
I think this is a victim
of a predator.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.051
Judging by the amount of

21:27.153 --> 21:30.421
Tracks we see here,
it was likely a lion.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.457
[narrator] <i> three mountain</i>
<i> lions are known to roam</i>
<i> this area.</i>

21:33.526 --> 21:38.229

<i> unsuspecting prey.</i>

21:38.231 --> 21:40.931
There's, there's so many
tracks through this valley,

21:40.933 --> 21:42.633
Um, right here by the pond.

21:42.735 --> 21:43.834
It's concerning.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.848
[jermaine] buckle up 'cause
it's about to get chilly.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.218
[wes] I might go around here
just for a minute.

22:02.288 --> 22:05.423
It's, this is all junipers.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.425
I mean, sure as hell ain't
gonna keep the rain out

22:07.427 --> 22:09.126
Unless we had
it ten feet thick.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.830
Juniper is really sparsy.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.200
So, we're trying it right now
and use it for wind break.

22:16.202 --> 22:18.936
As you can see, it's like,
ain't much wind breaking that.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.137
So, we gotta get a lot of it.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.206
Yeah, make it out here,

22:23.042 --> 22:25.810
You gotta stop the wind.

Get yourselves in here

You can have
an amazing shelter,
you can have a good fire,

But if you do not
have proper insulation,

23:49.128 --> 23:52.963

you will die.

Well, that tree right there
would be easy to cut down.

24:56.562 --> 24:59.530
I can get up above it.
Those would be good
boughs to lay on.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.865
[trish] that's probably
a good idea.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.900

Right. Let me try

[trish] you get one big
giant one, we'll get
some good boughs.

25:09.809 --> 25:15.446

hurt or injured,

26:03.362 --> 26:04.662
<i> I'm gone.</i>

26:04.730 --> 26:08.299

that temperature
dropping already, can't you?

26:35.628 --> 26:37.761
-[joe] uh-huh. Indeed.
-[ky] didn't take much.

26:37.863 --> 26:40.364

what're you seeing?
What do we need the most?

26:40.433 --> 26:42.533
[ky] um, everything.

26:42.535 --> 26:44.335
-Everything.
-[joe] it is a touch
drafty inside.

26:44.403 --> 26:48.038
I think, maybe if I keep
bringing you leafy boughs
that you can

26:48.140 --> 26:49.673
Thread on the inside,
would that work?

26:49.675 --> 26:51.809
-[gabby] yeah, you want me
to sit inside and keep going?
-[ky] yeah, maybe.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.410
Yep, I can. Sounds good.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.848
This location presents
a whole new set of challenges.

26:57.883 --> 27:01.018
<i> This wind, it's ferocious.</i>

27:01.020 --> 27:04.254
But thankfully,
we have a wind being blocked
by rock on one side.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.998
You got it, joe.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.800
-I can smell it.
-[gabby] it's a fire.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.802
-[gabby] it feels good,
though. Doesn't it?
-Oh, indeed!

27:19.805 --> 27:22.306
Here, I'll just give you some
more branches.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.408
-[joe] just keep adding
small little...
-I do.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.211
[joe] at least we can regulate
the temperature that way
and the height.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.613
I mean, we have to get just
a little bit bigger. I'm gonna
come up through this hole.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.381
[joe] okay.

27:37.223 --> 27:41.425
[wes] <i> takes about a million</i>
<i> juniper branches to fill</i>
<i> this sucker in.</i>

27:41.427 --> 27:44.161
You put one layer on
and the wind cuts right
through, you just gotta do

27:44.730 --> 27:45.963
Multi stacks.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.364
Takes forever.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.102

27:52.104 --> 27:55.406
-[grunts] woo!

27:55.408 --> 27:59.043
[wes] <i> temperature's dropping</i>
<i> the sun's starting to go dow</i>
<i> and you can feel it.</i>

27:59.045 --> 28:00.210

Five degrees every
five minutes.

28:01.947 --> 28:04.948
It's, it's starting to become
freezing now.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.785
-It's getting chilly, right?
-It's getting chilly.

28:07.787 --> 28:10.020
You know, first day,
you start your shelter

28:10.022 --> 28:12.489
And you get it going as much
as you have time for.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.858
<i> And that's about the stage</i>
<i> where we're at right now.</i>

28:14.927 --> 28:16.660
<i> Our shelter's okay.</i>

28:16.729 --> 28:19.430
Uh, but it's not good
by any means.
It's gonna take another

28:19.432 --> 28:20.698
Day or two

28:20.700 --> 28:22.700
To really get it tightened up.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.301
<i> So, it's gonna be</i>
<i> a cold night.</i>

28:24.303 --> 28:25.803
<i> We know night one sucks.</i>

28:37.717 --> 28:38.716
[jeremy] hey, rod.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.355
[rod speaking]

28:45.457 --> 28:47.825
[jeremy] I'm doing what I can,
man, my feet are gone.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.526
My right one,
I can't even feel it.

28:49.528 --> 28:53.330
My feet kill me every single
time I step outside.

28:53.332 --> 28:56.934
<i> But I don't wanna sit</i>
<i> in a shelter 14 days.</i>

28:56.936 --> 29:00.037
Rod, I think we need to get
what you got cut
and bring it back.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.538
-[rod] okay.
-We gotta get firewood.

29:01.607 --> 29:03.307
-Yep, okay. Sounds good.
-[trish] like, immediately.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.043
<i> The sun is setting</i>

29:06.045 --> 29:10.814
<i> And it took us a little</i>
<i> longer to make sure</i>
<i> our shoes are ready to go.</i>

29:10.816 --> 29:14.118
But there's just so much
to do on the first night.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.920
<i> So many things that need</i>
<i> to be done that are priority</i>

29:16.922 --> 29:20.324
<i> The whole shelter's not</i>
<i> covered in yet and uh,</i>

29:20.326 --> 29:22.192
<i> We need to get some</i>
<i> firewood, but, uh,</i>

29:22.194 --> 29:24.762
We have very limited
amount of time.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.900
I thought about it 'cause
that's not doing nothing.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.102
-It's not doing nothing
for us. No.
-No, it sure isn't.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.038
I mean, this shelter's big
enough that, you know,
we could have

29:35.107 --> 29:37.241
Another three or four
people in it.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.910
<i> And so, that's a lot of roo</i>
<i> to have to heat.</i>

29:39.912 --> 29:43.814
<i> So, we're gonna take one wal</i>
<i> basically almost down</i>
<i> and move that in,</i>

29:43.816 --> 29:47.017
<i> So we have a lean-to shelte</i>
<i> and a wind-block</i>

29:47.019 --> 29:48.585
<i> On the north side</i>

29:48.587 --> 29:52.656
<i> And we're gonna try to make</i>
<i> it so we have less space</i>
<i> to heat,</i>

29:52.725 --> 29:55.959
<i> So we can stay warm</i>
<i> without spending</i>
<i> too much energy.</i>

29:57.563 --> 29:58.896
This is not good.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.964
[jeremy] I'm gonna tell
you right now,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.600
-We're gonna be
in trouble tonight.
-Yep.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.403
-[rod] I don't think we'll all
be sleeping very much anyway.
-[jeremy] no.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.506
It's gonna be
a brutal night.

30:24.356 --> 30:27.157
[jake] oh, yes!
That is gonna feel amazing.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.294
-Cook my feet, bitch.
-[sara laughs]

30:30.296 --> 30:32.830
[jake] oh, god!
It's almost worse when
your feet start defrosting

30:32.832 --> 30:35.399
-'cause then you realize how
much it sucks, again.
-[sara] how much they hurt?

30:35.401 --> 30:36.633
[chuckles softly]

30:38.037 --> 30:40.337
-Oh, my gosh.
I cut my toe open.
-[sara] oh, my!

30:40.406 --> 30:42.706
I told you you needed
to check the bottom
of your feet.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.241
[jake] ah.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.043
-[waz] what is that?
-That is like half
of my toe's gone.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.412
[sara] that's half
his [bleep] toe.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.147
[jake] <i> my feet are</i>
<i> really banged up.</i>

30:50.416 --> 30:51.982
<i> And...</i>

30:51.984 --> 30:55.052
<i> I am feeling really,</i>
<i> genuinely concerned</i>

30:55.054 --> 30:56.720
<i> Just because</i>

30:56.722 --> 30:58.455
You know,
we're out here on ice

30:58.524 --> 31:02.226
And snow and I've now got
these open holes in the bottom
of my feet,

31:02.228 --> 31:04.394
So I need to be careful.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.830
<i> Don't wanna have to tap</i>
<i> out because of my feet.</i>

31:10.502 --> 31:16.306
-[waz] there's literally ice
on the floor on our shelter.
-[sara] uh-huh!

31:16.308 --> 31:19.543
I feel like
the temperature's dropped
20 degrees. [sniffs]

31:21.347 --> 31:23.413
This ground's gonna suck
the heat out of us.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.015
[waz] yeah.

31:25.951 --> 31:27.751
[sara] oh, I'm shaking.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.453
Getting super cold.

31:30.623 --> 31:33.957
<i> No, not... No. I'm gonna</i>
<i> make it through the night.</i>

31:33.959 --> 31:36.326
[jake] <i> just have to power</i>
<i> through this night of misery</i>

31:44.837 --> 31:46.336
[sara speaking]

31:46.438 --> 31:47.504
[waz speaking]

31:47.506 --> 31:48.939
[jake] it's too cold.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.441
[waz speaking]

31:52.311 --> 31:53.844
Make sure there
aren't any bears.

31:54.647 --> 31:57.614
Okay, okay. Oh, sharp!

32:02.421 --> 32:04.154
-[jake] you look there.
-[sara] okay. This.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.356
-[jake] [bleep]
-[sara] this.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.259
[sara] trying to get
warm again.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.099
[gabby] <i> it's night one.</i>
<i> I'm finishing up my hat.</i>

32:17.403 --> 32:19.202
It's been a pretty good
night so far.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.939
We took fire shifts,

32:22.040 --> 32:25.709
Um, at the moment,
ky and joe are sleeping.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.112
<i> I'm feeling pretty competen</i>
<i> at this point.</i>

32:29.114 --> 32:31.515
<i> If we can make</i>
<i> this shelter stronger</i>

32:31.517 --> 32:34.217
And continue to work together,
we're gonna be in good shape.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.257
-[sarah] it's started
to refreeze.
-[wes] yeah.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.691
[sarah] that's, that's...

32:42.594 --> 32:44.828
-[jermaine] what's starting
to refreeze?
-[wes] our water.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.129
[jermaine] are you kidding me?

32:46.799 --> 32:48.298
Wow.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.133
[wes] so, how're you feeling
right now?

32:50.235 --> 32:51.702
[jermaine] I'm starting
to shiver.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.904
[wes speaking]

32:55.341 --> 32:58.041
[jermaine] once we have boots,
that's gonna be another
gamechanger.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.911
We gotta figure it out

33:01.146 --> 33:02.312
'cause

33:02.314 --> 33:03.914
It's about to get really cold.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.518
[rod shivers]

33:09.521 --> 33:11.588
-I'm starting to shiver.
-[jeremy] are you?

33:11.590 --> 33:13.824
-[rod shivers]
-[jeremy] it's cold.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.226
Well, that wind is like
45 mile-an-hour gusts.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.461
[rod] this shelter sucks.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.764
[trish] this is probably
the worst shelter I've ever
been in.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.567
-[rod] it is the worst
I've been.
-[trish] the worst one.

33:23.569 --> 33:26.103
-[jeremy] we ain't trapping
any heat in this damn thing.
-[trish] no.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.739
-[rod] I hope we have
enough firewood for tonight.
-[trish] [bleep]

33:28.807 --> 33:30.040
That's not good.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.709
-I don't know how this
is gonna work.
-[rod shivers]

33:40.019 --> 33:43.720
[sara] oh, my god!
It's super cold.
I'm freezing.

33:45.524 --> 33:46.957
[jake] your back's so cold.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.425
[sara] I'm freezing.

33:50.095 --> 33:52.129
[waz] we survived the night.

33:52.131 --> 33:56.033
We're gonna get this shelter
insulated up a little bit
better than it is.

33:57.202 --> 34:00.303
We did as much as we
could yesterday, but...

34:00.305 --> 34:04.408
It needs more.
We need lots more trees.
I was just looking at it.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.443
[jake] yeah, the thing
that sucks is all the [bleep]
that we've

34:06.545 --> 34:09.212
Trapped down in the next
couple days starts drying up.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.416
So, it is gonna be
just non-stop.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.152
[waz] I'm gonna go do
some work.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.220
-[sara] is my face swollen?
-[jake] huh?

34:17.222 --> 34:19.756
[sara] is my face swollen?

34:19.825 --> 34:22.325
-[waz] yeah, you look
a little bit swollen.
-Yeah, I can feel it.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.963
Well, last night
was absolutely horrible.

34:26.999 --> 34:30.934
Um, my face looks like I got
into a fight with mike tyson.

34:32.004 --> 34:34.104
Pelts are wonderful.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.039
Keep you warm,
but I'm allergic to them.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.508
We got a nice fire, though.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.610
How are your feet feeling?

34:40.612 --> 34:43.713
There's just like from them,
kinda swelling up
and splitting

34:43.715 --> 34:45.715
Like, they were oozing
a little bit.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.518
And then, they stuck
together like this.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.220
-From the ooze.
-[sara] oh, no!

34:51.957 --> 34:54.458
[jake] I don't know how
hopeful I'm gonna be today,
but I'm gonna try.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.227
[sara] it's concerning.

35:05.504 --> 35:09.239
[rod] okay, I'm gonna get up
and go out. Trish, don't let
me step on your feet.

35:09.308 --> 35:12.008
-[trish] you're getting
firewood or floor? Okay.
-[rod] firewood.

35:13.011 --> 35:15.846
-How you feeling?
You feel good?
-Useless.

35:16.849 --> 35:19.116
-You? Look at me.
-Yeah. [laughs]

35:19.118 --> 35:22.752
[jeremy] <i> out there like</i>
<i> a crutch to the team,</i>
<i> sitting in a shelter,</i>

35:23.422 --> 35:25.055
And tending to my feet.

35:25.057 --> 35:27.124
I mean, that's not what
I came here to do.

35:27.126 --> 35:28.425
<i> It just feels like I'm</i>

35:29.128 --> 35:30.927
<i> Not contributing and...</i>

35:31.797 --> 35:33.930
I'm not liking that at all.

35:33.932 --> 35:37.400
[trish] we need a pot of snow
and I'm too cold to get up
and go get it.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.803
I'm fixing to get some.

35:41.206 --> 35:43.540
-Here, I'll get you some.
-You gonna grab it?

35:43.609 --> 35:45.509
-Here I'll get it.
-Just gonna get it
right there.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.711
-Or you can get it over there.
-I'm gonna get fresh snow.

35:47.713 --> 35:50.113
-[jeremy] pack it in tight,
so it's...
-Okay.

35:50.115 --> 35:54.251
[rod] <i> you know, even though</i>
<i> my back right now is right</i>
<i> around probably a six in pai</i>

35:54.319 --> 35:58.221
If their limitation tells
them, "my feet hurt,
I need to stop,"

35:58.223 --> 36:00.357
<i> I respect that.</i>
<i> They need to stop.</i>

36:00.425 --> 36:02.826
When I can,
I'm gonna do whatever
I can to help the team.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.129
I feel rain.

36:07.232 --> 36:08.465
[bleep]

36:10.335 --> 36:12.802
-I definitely feel rain.
-[trish] I just felt it, too.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.506
[rod] <i> if it starts raining,</i>
<i> it's gonna suck.</i>

36:16.508 --> 36:18.842
If we're wet
and our beds are wet,

36:18.944 --> 36:20.710
That's gonna be miserable.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.145
[trish] that ain't
gonna be miserable,

36:22.214 --> 36:23.713
It's gonna be a hypothermic
mid-tap.

36:31.723 --> 36:35.058
[ky] morning of day two!

36:35.060 --> 36:39.429
We made it. I think if that's
our hardest night, then
we're gonna be okay.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.898
-We got this.
-But then, I've also

36:41.900 --> 36:44.234
Quite often had surprises
on day nine!

36:44.336 --> 36:50.140
So, then, day 12. [laughs]
so, I'm not gonna get
too cocky just yet.

36:50.209 --> 36:51.708
You know, this is an ideal
location for us

36:51.710 --> 36:54.711
<i> With the wind being blocked</i>
<i> by rock on one side.</i>

36:54.713 --> 36:56.613
I think we have
a good foundation,

36:56.615 --> 36:59.449
Um, but, the next few days
we're gonna have to work
to fortify that.

37:01.820 --> 37:02.852
[ky] ah!

37:03.822 --> 37:05.822
There's some weather
coming in, guys.

37:05.824 --> 37:06.823
[gabby] great.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.425
[ky] like, if it
comes this way,

37:09.461 --> 37:11.061
Which...

37:11.063 --> 37:14.064
That is the wind direction,
we're gonna get some rain.

37:14.833 --> 37:15.966
Okay.

37:17.202 --> 37:21.004
Yeah, we've gotta, um,
put some stuff on our shelter.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.106
If it's a light shower...

37:23.108 --> 37:26.710
-[gabby] uh-huh.
-...We'll get drizzled on,
but if it's sustained,

37:26.712 --> 37:29.212
-We're in trouble.
-[gabby] right.

37:29.214 --> 37:34.117
-It's cold.
-All right, I'm gonna get as
many little boughs as I can.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.920
-[gabby] okay.
-Just and when...
We just need to

37:36.922 --> 37:38.655
Just bump up that top.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.700
-[wes] it's raining.
-[jermaine] is it?

37:50.702 --> 37:52.335
[sarah] yeah, it's starting
to rain, guys.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.639
Oh, gotta get wood.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.341
[bleep]

37:59.444 --> 38:02.812
I'm cold. Gotta push
mentally.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.117
Okay.

38:08.253 --> 38:09.953
That's gonna do it.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.455
I'm shivering a lot, dude.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.125
Oh, I gotta get inside.

38:16.228 --> 38:17.460
[bleep]

38:18.130 --> 38:19.963
I'm freezing right now.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.999
Just making sure

38:23.001 --> 38:24.501
I don't go hypothermic.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.104
But I feel like I'm about to,
so I'm just getting warm.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.007
[wes] you doing good in there?

38:32.110 --> 38:34.444
[jermaine] just can't stop
the shivering.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.613
-I can't like shake it,
you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.651
-I mean, I'm definitely
pre-hypothermic.
-Yeah.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.920
[wes] if...

38:43.922 --> 38:47.824
You don't get warm
and it goes into hypothermia,
you are out of here?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.225
Yeah.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.161
I would really hate
to lose jermaine.

38:51.262 --> 38:52.729
<i> But if he goes</i>
<i> into hypothermia,</i>

38:52.731 --> 38:54.431
This challenge
is over for him.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.265
It's just over.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.599
There's no coming back
from that.

38:57.235 --> 38:58.702
I am scared right now, dude.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.205
[wes] this is really bad.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.645
[jermaine speaking]

39:12.617 --> 39:14.551
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, it's a good one.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.119
[jermaine speaking]

39:16.121 --> 39:17.921
[wes] <i> jermaine's getting</i>
<i> really cold.</i>

39:17.923 --> 39:20.824
<i> He's shivering uncontrollabl</i>

39:20.826 --> 39:25.528
<i> So, I'm gonna keep a close e</i>
<i> on that, make sure he's</i>
<i> the guy next to the fire.</i>

39:25.530 --> 39:29.532
And we'll see if we can't
turn that situation around
real quick.

39:29.601 --> 39:30.734
It's nice and hot.

39:32.504 --> 39:35.004
Nice and hot.

39:35.006 --> 39:38.508
[jermaine] I think I'm getting
better. My hands aren't
shaking like they were.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.945
<i> One thing I don't wanna</i>
<i> do is get medically tapped.</i>

39:42.013 --> 39:44.514
I'm trying to just get warm
'cause once I get my core up,

39:44.950 --> 39:46.216
Then uh,

39:46.218 --> 39:47.517
It should be all right.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.119
Crazy challenge.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.420
Ridiculous, yeah.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.564
[ky] how's it looking? Did...

40:01.600 --> 40:04.634
I feel like we can
get a heap on there
quite quickly, huh?

40:04.703 --> 40:07.036
[gabby] yeah, I'm filling
a lot of gaps inside here
at the moment.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.938
[ky] perfect!

40:09.040 --> 40:12.041
I got a lot of, um,
thicker stuff off that
last one.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.476
[gabby] perfect.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.112
[ky] is it just me or is it
colder today than
it was yesterday?

40:16.114 --> 40:18.648
[gabby] it's much, much colder
today than it was yesterday.

40:20.752 --> 40:24.053
[joe] this is so much harder
to do when you're weak.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.022
I am noticeably weaker today.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.959
I know my blood sugar's
definitely down.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.829
I mean, even standing up,

40:34.366 --> 40:37.100
I got a momentary period
of dizziness.

40:39.337 --> 40:42.105
I promised this team
I would give them
everything I have.

40:42.808 --> 40:43.907
[grunts]

40:44.509 --> 40:45.708
No matter what.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.313
One step at a time.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.749
Don't think about the day.

40:53.819 --> 40:56.419
Right here.
This is what's important.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.058
[ky] joseph, you should
just rest.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.728
Honestly, I can't have you
falling down on us.

41:05.730 --> 41:08.465
-Just drop that, rest. Please.
-I understand.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.300
-I'm coming up.
-[ky] all right.

41:10.302 --> 41:11.301
-You get it?
-[joe] yes.

41:11.303 --> 41:12.936
All right.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.505
We need you.

41:15.507 --> 41:19.108
[joe] <i> like, physically,</i>
<i> I feel drained. Right now,</i>
<i> I'm ready for a nap.</i>

41:19.110 --> 41:22.579
Take, uh, quite a bit
of water in and just rest

41:22.581 --> 41:24.314
For a little bit to
kinda recoup a little.

41:25.317 --> 41:27.417
[gabby] joe, how
you feeling, man?

41:27.419 --> 41:29.352
I just started feeling
nauseous, that's why I had
to lay down quick.

41:29.421 --> 41:30.853
[gabby] oh, I understand.

41:34.426 --> 41:37.026
-[joe belches] ooh.
Excuse me. Yeah.
-[gabby] ooh. You okay?

41:37.028 --> 41:38.695
[ky] what's that?

41:38.697 --> 41:42.365
-[gabby] uh, joe's a little
nauseous in here.
-[ky] joe is?

41:42.433 --> 41:45.001
-[gabby] yeah.
-Yeah, it's just that level of
dehydration, I know it.

41:45.003 --> 41:49.305
I just, yeah it's a prime
characteristic of it.

41:49.307 --> 41:53.510
[narrator] <i> in cold, dry air</i>
<i> sweat evaporates</i>
<i> almost instantaneously,</i>

41:53.512 --> 41:56.045
<i> Making hydration levels</i>
<i> hard to track.</i>

41:56.114 --> 41:58.214
<i> In addition,</i>
<i> heart rates elevate</i>

41:58.216 --> 42:02.519
<i> To keep internal body</i>
<i> temperatures up,</i>
<i> which accelerates dehydratio</i>

42:04.523 --> 42:06.422
[gabby] try and stay
hydrated, joe.

42:06.424 --> 42:07.724
We're gonna finish
this together.

42:17.802 --> 42:19.402
[trish] rod, do you need
to come in and warm up?

42:20.005 --> 42:22.005
No, let me keep going.

42:22.007 --> 42:24.340
I'm afraid if I stop, I'm not
gonna be able to stand
back up.

42:24.409 --> 42:27.310
[trish] yeah.
I understand that.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.246
<i> Rod's a hard worker.</i>

42:30.315 --> 42:33.049
Been really trying hard
to pull for the team.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.084
[rod shivers]

42:35.086 --> 42:38.955
He's definitely trying to make
sure that we'll be,
we'll be okay tonight.

42:40.659 --> 42:42.759
-Let me just sit these
right here.
-[trish] yeah.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.030
[grunts]

42:47.032 --> 42:49.632
-[jeremy] rod, why don't you
come in and take a break?
-I got this last one.

42:52.203 --> 42:54.037
Okay.

42:54.138 --> 42:57.040
Guys, you think that's enough
wood for tonight?

42:57.042 --> 43:00.910
-Or you think we need more?
-No, I think, I think, you did
an amazing job down there.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.112
-[jeremy] I think
we're good, rod.
-[trish] I think we're okay.

43:03.114 --> 43:05.315
[rod] okay.
And my back's killing me.

43:07.419 --> 43:08.818
[trish] I appreciate it.

43:10.322 --> 43:13.122
I appreciate your commitment
to our team.

43:13.124 --> 43:16.192
-Come on, rodney. Get in here.
-[rod] okay.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.861
Get your tail in here
and warm up.

43:18.963 --> 43:22.465
-How's your feet feeling?
All right, well, get in here.
-[rod] they're frozen. Okay.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.601
-Listen to your team.
-But once I get in,
I ain't coming back out.

43:24.603 --> 43:27.203
[trish] that's all right.
That's all right.

43:27.205 --> 43:29.205
-[rod] oh, it's always easy
just to stay--
-little bursts

43:29.207 --> 43:30.907
Of rod are better than

43:30.909 --> 43:33.843
Big bursts of rod and then,
he leaves 'cause
he's hypothermic.

43:36.147 --> 43:37.780
I doubt I'll leave 'cause
I'm hypothermic.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.616
If I leave,
it's 'cause of my back.

43:39.618 --> 43:41.617
<i> I took a risk on day one</i>

43:41.619 --> 43:45.655
<i> Climbed up that hillside</i>
<i> to cut those trees down and</i>
<i> I'm paying the price for it</i>

43:45.724 --> 43:47.357
I can deal with it.

43:47.425 --> 43:50.226
And I've been dealing
with it, you know,

43:51.229 --> 43:52.829
It's one of those things that

43:52.831 --> 43:55.198
I don't know if it's gonna
get better, if it's gonna
get worse.

43:55.200 --> 43:58.901
<i> And if it drags out,</i>
<i> I've gotta go get</i>
<i> attention for it.</i>

43:58.903 --> 44:01.204
-[jeremy] you all right, rod?
-Bit hurt.

44:01.206 --> 44:04.040
You need to just take a break,
rod, you need to
get off your back,

44:04.809 --> 44:05.808
Lay down,

44:06.611 --> 44:09.312
Let me and trish handle this.

44:09.314 --> 44:10.313
We got ya!

44:21.026 --> 44:22.025
It sucks.

44:23.061 --> 44:25.261
Rod is a huge part
of this team.

44:25.330 --> 44:27.664
<i> I know he's hurt</i>
<i> and he's in pain.</i>

44:27.732 --> 44:29.699
<i> I can see he don't wanna</i>
<i> go home.</i>

44:30.435 --> 44:32.201
<i> But he's contemplating it.</i>

44:32.203 --> 44:35.605
-Hey, I need you.
Trish needs you.
-Yeah.
