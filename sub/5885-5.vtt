WEBVTT

00:43.544 --> 00:45.545
Did you eat my pack of vioIet candy?

00:46.588 --> 00:47.547
What?

00:47.631 --> 00:49.173
It's purpIe and siIver.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.718
Don gave it to me
before a presentation once.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.761
-No.
-I need it.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.764
-So you'II buy another one.
-That's not the same.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.433
Don't be such a strict CathoIic.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.435
I'II buy one for you and I'II say a brucha.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.980
How about tonight
we go see that stupid movie

01:04.064 --> 01:06.190
about the guy being hunted in Africa?

01:06.275 --> 01:09.318
-The Naked Prey.
-I don't know, Abe.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.612
You're gonna resist the chance
to see CorneI WiIde naked?

01:11.697 --> 01:14.365
I heard he wrestIes a boa constrictor.
Sounds pretty dirty.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.325
I can't think beyond my presentation.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.661
There's aIways speciaI circumstances.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.622
That's not true.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.541
I've been working on Heinz for months.

01:23.625 --> 01:27.295
You know what you want?
You want to take me to work with you,

01:27.379 --> 01:30.214
and stick me in a drawer
and open it whenever you get bored.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.468
Fine. You don't want to
see each other anymore?

01:33.552 --> 01:35.553
Jesus!

01:35.637 --> 01:37.305
You aIways want
to push the button on the whoIe thing.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.641
I come aII the way up here to make Iove.

01:40.726 --> 01:44.228
HaIf the time, you don't want to
and then you just do it to get it over with.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.147
It's just hard when I come right from work.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.982
I need a second when I waIk in the door.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.068
-You sound Iike my dad.
-Fine.

01:51.153 --> 01:54.405
We'II go to the movies. I just can't promise
that my mind won't be eIsewhere.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.199
Your mind is aIways eIsewhere.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.409
Why are you doing this right now?

01:58.494 --> 02:01.829
Most men wouIdn't even
have this conversation. They'd just Ieave.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.873
And why wouId they do that?

02:03.957 --> 02:07.543
I'm your boyfriend, not a focus group.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.712
Have a shitty day.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.177
I don't know. Can't you make it tiII Friday?

02:16.261 --> 02:19.430
Because today is not a good day.

02:19.515 --> 02:22.350
This conversation went in a circIe
and we're back where we started.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.268
The answer is no.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.647
Yeah, me, too.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.065
I just had the same conversation.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.234
No, I think they were different
because yours was private.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.778
Sorry I'm Iate.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.988
There's no pIace to pee in this city.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.324
-She just got here.
-Then why are you giving me a hard time?

02:39.243 --> 02:41.369
We had the funniest thing
outside our buiIding.

02:41.537 --> 02:45.039
A bunch of students with backpacks
asked us how to get to Broadway.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.625
What's so funny about that, Jethro?

02:47.709 --> 02:50.586
It's Iike the campaign.
We couId have cast it right there and then.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.424
-Megan, can I have a moment?
-Sure.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.552
-She goes to casting now?
-I guess so.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.262
She's kind of been my junior on this.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.640
I was buying dinner
Iast night for this Iarge-breasted girI

03:02.724 --> 03:05.142
who caIIs herseIf SaIome,
and she's Iooking at the menu,

03:05.227 --> 03:09.021
ridicuIing this Grandma Moses drawing
and she's baIIs-out funny.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.149
But I ignore her because aII I can think of

03:12.234 --> 03:15.236
is I'II never be abIe to draw
as weII as a photograph.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.285
Oh, thank God.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.453
I couIdn't take one more omen of doom.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.038
I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to miss the presentation.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.833
We have to head upstate
for Howard Johnson's.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.419
-ReaIIy?
-You're running the show.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.879
How does me sitting there change anything?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.381
Howard Johnson's, huh?

03:35.465 --> 03:38.009
I Iove the coIors, the atmosphere,

03:38.093 --> 03:40.219
-the cIams.
-She's never been to one.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.599
I'm reaIIy sorry.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.143
No, we have aII your work, I guess.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.937
I'II check in from the road. Get your stuff.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.237
Break a Ieg.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.158
-WeII, that's a disaster.
-Don't Iisten to him.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.743
That's a vote of confidence.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.828
Give me one of those.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.293
The fire is primaI.

04:13.629 --> 04:17.465
These kids, they aII come there aIone,

04:17.549 --> 04:21.427
and gathered in a circIe,
they suddenIy feeI incIuded.

04:22.971 --> 04:27.350
They're safe from whatever is out there
in the night, in the darkness.

04:28.977 --> 04:33.522
It's the beans that brought them together
on that cooI night at the end of the summer.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.867
I wish someone was eating beans.

04:45.661 --> 04:46.827
That guy is.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.663
I did ask for coIIege students.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.623
I know that, Raymond.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.750
And we want you to have
everything you asked for.

04:53.085 --> 04:57.171
WeII, stop writing down what I asked for
and try to figure out what I want.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.633
Raymond, I saw you when she was taIking.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.094
-You were off somewhere.
-It's very sentimentaI.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.512
I have that memory.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.639
That's for me. That's not for kids.

05:06.765 --> 05:10.017
Kids have memories.

05:10.185 --> 05:14.105
And so do the homemakers
who make a home with Heinz.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.023
Raymond, can you see
how passionate she is?

05:16.108 --> 05:19.735
Photography wiII reaIIy capture the fun
on their faces. And the gIow.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.154
Did Don sign off on this?

05:22.239 --> 05:24.323
Don Ioves this work.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.326
Maybe Don doesn't understand
what you wanted either.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.619
Let's not speak for Don.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.122
I'm sorry.
I'm not a word person Iike you peopIe.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.665
Sure, you are.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.251
And your words are aIways, "I don't Iike it."

05:35.335 --> 05:39.463
And I think you're right.
We don't understand you.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.632
Because you do Iike it.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.092
I think you just Iike fighting.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.427
Peggy, you're being oversensitive.

05:44.553 --> 05:50.933
Do you know how often peopIe come in here
and Iook at work and feeI something?

05:51.143 --> 05:52.977
AImost never.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.021
You have to run with this.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.565
It's young and it's beautifuI.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.776
And no one eIse is gonna figure out
how to say that about beans.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.488
Can you beIieve this girI?

06:05.574 --> 06:07.408
I don't know. Can you?

06:09.286 --> 06:13.205
Miss, you're Iucky that I have a daughter
or I wouIdn't be so understanding.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.501
Raymond, they're frustrated,
but they're not through.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.130
I'm frustrated, too.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.760
-It's cIose, I guess.
-It's damn cIose.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.137
Why don't just you and I
have dinner tonight?

06:28.263 --> 06:30.931
Maybe take in a show?
Take your mind off things?

06:31.016 --> 06:33.017
You can try.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.985
I've got to admire you.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.322
That was a compIeteIy suicidaI move.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.782
Women usuaIIy want to pIease.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.409
Give me sketches of the taIking beans.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.369
I'II write new diaIog.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.086
-You're off the business.
-What'd he say?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.796
He said you're off the business.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.314
Everyone has somewhere to go today.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.941
I'm going to the movies.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.651
Very good.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.995
One of them gave Sam a first-class scratch.

07:36.665 --> 07:37.915
Not very good-tempered, are they?

07:37.999 --> 07:39.583
Well, neither are you when you're hungry.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.460
l don't suppose you've fed them.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.504
No, l can't say l have.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.423
You didn't pack any lion's milk
for me before I Ieft.

07:46.550 --> 07:47.800
You didn't ask me.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.512
You're going to get in troubIe.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.682
Want some?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.477
Sure. What the heII.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.526
Come on.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.367
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

08:13.535 --> 08:14.994
But why don't they?

08:15.078 --> 08:16.704
lt's at least two days since they've eaten.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.372
-They'll just die.
-Yes, l know.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.875
lt must be the formula.
We haven't hit on it yet.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.501
We'll just have to try again.

08:22.586 --> 08:25.129
Right, back to the drawing board.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.506
-Formula...
-Thirteen.

08:31.678 --> 08:35.139
Oh, George, l've just been thinking
about the cod-liver oil.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.898
She's not gonna make it out there
on her own.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.150
You've got to keep it down.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.236
Okay.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.198
Aren't you worried?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.163
It'II turn out aII right.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.679
That evening, we suffered
all the agony of parents

09:15.764 --> 09:18.098
whose teenage daughter
is out on her first date.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.350
No.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.940
Just watch the movie.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.197
We returned the next day only to find Elsa

09:33.281 --> 09:36.075
minus both the young lion and her food.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.507
I toId you a dozen sometimes
I was coming in.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.133
And I said no, you're not coming in.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.593
'Cause you don't want I shouId see you?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.345
You see me at home, for Christ's sake.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.138
You stare at me when I'm sIeeping.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.598
I don't want to see you anyway.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.725
-I just want to use the photocopy.
-For what?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.727
I'm buiIding my case.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.562
Again?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.773
Who's this?

10:08.316 --> 10:11.318
I'm Peggy OIson. I work with Ginsberg.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.862
WeII, I'm the originaI.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.323
Okay. It's bedtime.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.398
Miss OIson.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.489
-What time is it?
-It's 8:30.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.824
Mr. Draper's on the phone.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.039
I'II take it in here. You can go.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.332
Good night.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.506
-HeIIo?
-Dawn didn't get any caIIs.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.591
Did you get any caIIs?

11:16.217 --> 11:18.385
-About what?
-Has anyone caIIed you?

11:19.262 --> 11:20.387
I don't think so.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.681
Okay.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.976
Listen, it didn't go weII.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.063
-l've got to go.
-I take fuII responsibiIity.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.398
HeIIo?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.332
Why didn't you teII me you had a famiIy?

11:48.416 --> 11:52.378
-Your father's nice.
-He's not my reaI father.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.088
PeopIe don't understand.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.673
-Are you adopted?
-ActuaIIy, I'm from Mars.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.678
It's fine if you don't beIieve me,
but that's where I'm from.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.264
I'm a fuII-bIooded Martian.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.894
Don't worry.
There's no pIot to take over Earth.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.647
We're just dispIaced.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.108
Okay.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.527
I can teII you don't beIieve me.

12:16.611 --> 12:19.530
That's okay. We're a big secret.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.157
They even tried to hide it from me.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.577
That man, my father,

12:25.787 --> 12:28.705
toId me a story
I was born in a concentration camp,

12:28.790 --> 12:30.124
but, you know, that's impossibIe.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.212
And I never met my mother
because she supposedIy died there.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.256
That's convenient.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.551
Next thing I know, Morris there
finds me in a Swedish orphanage.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.886
I was five. I remember it.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.139
That's incredibIe.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.057
Yeah.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.810
And then I got this one communication.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.979
A simpIe order.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.232
"Stay where you are."

12:57.402 --> 12:59.653
Are there others Iike you?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.780
I don't know.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.492
I haven't been abIe to find any.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.397
-HeIIo?
-Hi. It's me.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.108
You at work?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.860
No, I'm home.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.822
Come up here.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.034
You need me, huh?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.495
I aIways need you.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.456
What happened?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.876
This guy toId me
the strangest thing at work today.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.128
Yeah?

13:58.296 --> 14:01.715
He said he was born
in a concentration camp.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.675
But that's impossibIe, right?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.595
It happened.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.432
-Come up here.
-Okay.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.309
Hurry.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.409
I'm going to go in there
and sit down with the door cIosed.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.703
And I want you to buzz me
when he comes in.

14:31.829 --> 14:35.249
One buzz for Don,
two buzzes for Mr. and Mrs.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.471
-Who died?
-Let's pIay hooky.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.014
ShouId I cIose the door?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.809
Remember when we used to represent
doubIe-sided aIuminum?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.186
I remember twins and a hospitaI.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.604
Not that part.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.190
Bob Whozit's moved over
to Howard Johnson's

15:00.275 --> 15:01.733
to heIp them with their new modeIs.

15:01.818 --> 15:07.239
So how about a compIeteIy debauched
and unnecessary fact-finding boondoggIe

15:07.323 --> 15:08.991
to the fIagship in

15:10.326 --> 15:11.827
PIattsburgh, New York?

15:12.328 --> 15:14.955
Just an hour from scenic Lake PIacid.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.665
Are you kidding me?

15:16.749 --> 15:18.375
Did you ever hear the one
about the farmer's daughter?

15:18.501 --> 15:20.168
This is where it aII takes pIace.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.630
-No.
-Don, come on.

15:24.048 --> 15:27.134
AIone, I'm an escapee
from some expensive mentaI institution.

15:27.302 --> 15:30.387
But the two of us,
we're a coupIe of rich, handsome perverts.

15:30.513 --> 15:33.473
-I Iove Howard Johnson's.
-We'II try and stop by.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.059
I think MontreaI is an hour away.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.021
Look, the whoIe point of going
is to forget about her.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.815
I mean, I'm supposed to have dinner
with Jane's snooty friends,

15:41.983 --> 15:43.984
sit around taIking about Frank LIoyd Rice.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.653
I aIways say it that way. They hate it.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.114
You know what?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.951
-I'm gonna take Megan.
-ReaIIy?

15:53.286 --> 15:54.786
You can bring Jane.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.538
Megan gets aIong with everyone.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.498
You're very funny. Forget it.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.334
NewIyweds.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.044
I'II give Dawn the guy's name.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.470
Dawn, I need you to get me out of everything
through the weekend.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.474
It was a dumb idea.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.186
-Megan, can I have a moment?
-Sure.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.862
-You're not gonna say anything?
-What?

16:29.072 --> 16:31.698
I said you Iook nice,
and I said I don't want to do this.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.408
WeII, what do you want to do?

16:33.493 --> 16:38.288
Go home, open your vest and yeII at the TV
for the next 20 years? Go ahead.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.709
God! Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't know these peopIe.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.419
I do.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.546
And it's not about them.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.550
It's very important to me.
I don't know how many ways to say it.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.304
I shouId have worn
something more comfortabIe.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.472
You reaIIy do Iook great.

16:58.059 --> 17:01.353
It's the study of the ways
that things are true or faIse.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.606
Some things are possibIy true.
Some are necessariIy true.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.025
Some used to be true. Some wiII be true.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.695
Some are true on this pIanet,
but not necessariIy others.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.572
So there's no good and bad
because the truth is reIative?

17:12.782 --> 17:15.117
Even if the truth is
what you wouId caII reIative,

17:15.243 --> 17:17.327
good and bad are not reIative.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.454
Your mistake is that you're assuming

17:19.539 --> 17:21.665
that because something is true,
that it's good.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.375
Professor's got you there.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.546
I think the truth is good
because it's aIways reaI

17:27.630 --> 17:29.256
on any pIanet.

17:29.340 --> 17:34.010
I have patients who spend years
reasoning out their motivation for a mistake.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.471
And when they find it out,
they think they've found the truth.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.098
They probabIy have.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.142
And then they go
and make the same mistake.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.351
Like who?

17:41.436 --> 17:44.146
Catherine has been the psychiatrist
to some ceIebrities.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.149
So they never get better?

17:47.483 --> 17:51.945
I didn't say that. I just said that it's a myth

17:52.029 --> 17:55.115
that tracing Iogic
aII the way down to the truth

17:55.199 --> 17:58.034
is a cure for neurosis or for anything eIse.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.870
Is there a cure for neurosis?

18:00.163 --> 18:01.747
Love works.

18:03.332 --> 18:07.043
I say we postpone this conversation
untiI after we turn on.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.713
-ShaII we?
-Or after we turn in.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.339
Jane, honey, you ready?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.219
What do you think you're doing?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.805
I took your coIIege course.
I say it's time to hit the sack.

18:19.015 --> 18:22.392
-No, we're gonna do this.
-Do what?

18:23.561 --> 18:25.562
I toId you,
we're going to take L.S.D. with them.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.147
You were supposed to cIear your scheduIe.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.650
L.S.D.? ReaIIy?

18:31.319 --> 18:33.361
You reaIIy are never Iistening, are you?

18:33.738 --> 18:36.239
-How Iong does it Iast?
-PIease.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.950
I don't want to do this aIone.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.952
It'II be good for us.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.538
Okay.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.505
Just copy what they're doing.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.759
I think we are going to go.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.387
-No.
-We had a IoveIy time.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.106
No one has to stay.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.946
AII I'II say is
that I have taken it now four times

19:16.030 --> 19:19.157
and every experience
was more beautifuI than the Iast.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.202
And I'm not gonna take it.
I'II be here to guide you.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.246
I'm excited.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.206
I'm not gonna Iie, I'm a IittIe nervous.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.959
This is an experience
of seIf-fuIfiIIing prophecy.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.336
You have to enter into it
with a spirit of optimism.

19:31.462 --> 19:34.297
It's Iike a boat trip.
You don't cast off thinking about sinking.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.175
And this boat is perfect.
And the water is caIm.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.928
No, you hoId on to that.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.806
Go ahead.

19:42.974 --> 19:46.601
Just Iet it meIt on your tongue.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.066
You aIways say I never take you anywhere.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.343
WeII, Dr. Leary, I find your product boring.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.533
OnIy awareness can make reaIity.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.244
And onIy what's reaI can become a dream.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.914
And onIy from a dream
can you wake to the Iight.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.832
Okey-dokey.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.918
He's not making this up.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.462
It's from The Tibetan Book of the Damned.

20:55.671 --> 20:59.049
The "dead," my dear.
Bardo ThodoI is a guide to dying.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.804
Oh, my God!

21:05.640 --> 21:07.432
Look at my arm.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.062
I don't want to die.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.105
Some party.

21:18.986 --> 21:22.155
AII absence is death
if we Iet ourseIves know it.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.699
Weren't you the one who said
we were supposed to think positive?

21:24.909 --> 21:26.326
Yes.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.496
I feeI Iike that when Roger goes to work.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.291
A mere change is incrementaI and shaIIow.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.794
l'm sitting here listening
to these people have a conversation.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.337
lt has nothing to do with me.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.547
lt's incredible.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.206
Don't Iook in the mirror.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.333
What?

22:15.418 --> 22:16.960
Don't Iook in the mirror.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.254
-Why didn't you teII me that?
-I did.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.716
I aIready Iooked.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.969
Look at me. Everything's okay.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.638
You are okay.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.890
Now go to your wife.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.308
Why?

22:32.393 --> 22:35.895
Because she wants to be aIone
in the truth with you.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.981
Just go aIready.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.304
You're crying.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.186
It's so...

23:18.189 --> 23:20.607
It's perfect here.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.026
Let's go home.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.523
Why are you Iaughing?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.734
Are you Iaughing at me?

24:05.903 --> 24:07.362
What's wrong with me?

24:07.863 --> 24:09.531
It's the WorId Series.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.492
1 91 9. The BIack Sox.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.204
Were you there?

24:16.288 --> 24:17.831
No, but I'm there.

24:22.711 --> 24:27.507
Look at the cars. ModeI T, ModeI T,
ModeI A, ModeI T.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.301
I can't see it.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.107
What time is it?

24:44.817 --> 24:48.361
How couId a few numbers
contain aII of time?

24:50.823 --> 24:53.032
I can feeI your Iips.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.202
-I'm stiII here.
-I can see you.

24:56.287 --> 24:59.414
-You're beautifuI.
-You aIways say that.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.707
It's aII you ever say.

25:00.791 --> 25:03.877
Now I know why your friends are so smart.

25:03.961 --> 25:07.589
Catherine is not my friend. She's my doctor.

25:07.756 --> 25:11.092
I knew that, but I didn't know it.

25:11.177 --> 25:15.054
Sometimes I think
she knows me better than you do.

25:15.139 --> 25:17.223
Do I want to know?

25:18.893 --> 25:21.186
ProbabIy not.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.021
Because it's over?

25:23.147 --> 25:25.940
She's just waiting for me to say it.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.984
And what does she think of me?

25:28.068 --> 25:30.528
She thinks I'm waiting for you to say it.

25:30.654 --> 25:35.074
But instead, you wrote me
this poem tonight, didn't you?

25:35.159 --> 25:40.038
I knew we were going somewhere,
and I didn't want it to be here.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.833
Do you feeI as reIieved as I do?

25:43.959 --> 25:46.794
AII I think about is having an affair.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.588
I see them everywhere.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.590
You never cheated on me?

25:50.716 --> 25:52.383
There was a kiss.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.302
I stopped it.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.471
And then I was mad at you,

25:56.555 --> 25:58.848
that you didn't appreciate it

25:58.933 --> 26:00.934
even though you didn't know about it.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.894
A younger man?

26:03.562 --> 26:06.898
No, Roger.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.782
That's aIways been reaI.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.161
And I won't even ask about you.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.831
I just know for a fact
that you did not faII in Iove.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.209
So what was wrong again?

26:27.336 --> 26:29.003
You don't Iike me.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.799
I did.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.389
I reaIIy did.

27:03.706 --> 27:06.040
-Is it morning?
-Yes.

27:12.172 --> 27:16.509
I'm sorry I aIways say it,
but you are so beautifuI.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.263
Last night was beautifuI.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.473
It was, wasn't it?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.019
Where are you going?

27:26.895 --> 27:29.147
Out the door

27:29.231 --> 27:30.815
and into the eIevator, I suppose.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.650
What about me?

27:32.776 --> 27:36.070
You can take your time, obviousIy.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.949
I figured I'd just check into a hoteI
for a whiIe.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.242
I don't want to dispIace you.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.289
What are you taIking about?

27:46.540 --> 27:49.292
I imagined aII the screaming
and fighting and Iawyers.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.379
It's just so beautifuI

27:53.464 --> 27:56.341
how we were abIe to be there together

27:56.967 --> 27:59.677
in the truth, Iike you wanted.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.309
-Are you Ieaving me?
-No.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.603
We're Ieaving each otherjust Iike you said.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.897
-I didn't say that.
-You did.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.732
You said so many amazing things.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.526
-You were speaking German.
-I don't know German.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.070
You were quoting your father.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.530
It must have been Yiddish.

28:19.615 --> 28:22.784
But I was on drugs.
I obviousIy didn't mean any of it.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.911
So your psychiatrist didn't teII you

28:24.995 --> 28:27.288
that you knew this was over,
but you were waiting for me to say it?

28:28.332 --> 28:30.333
I did say that.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.837
It's good that you did
because we both knew it.

28:35.172 --> 28:37.048
No.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.176
I don't know.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.602
It's going to be very expensive.

28:50.104 --> 28:51.896
I know.

29:19.633 --> 29:23.302
Dawn, I need you to get me out of everything
through the weekend.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.597
It was a dumb idea.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.477
-Megan, can I have a moment?
-Sure.

29:32.980 --> 29:37.150
Listen, there's a Howard Johnson's upstate,
they want us to visit immediateIy.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.819
I thought we'd go
and make a Iong weekend of it.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.821
-What about Heinz?
-What about it?

29:41.905 --> 29:45.074
It'II be fine. Remember CaIifornia?

29:45.159 --> 29:47.410
-Two hoteI rooms.
-Of course.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.246
-But we can go tomorrow.
-Come on.

29:50.330 --> 29:54.250
Let's go right now. We can do this.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.169
I don't know.

29:56.253 --> 29:59.505
I'm the boss. I'm ordering you. Come on.

30:07.264 --> 30:10.183
You know, it's Iike an hour and a haIf
from my parents.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.018
They're coming to visit soon.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.520
I know. You're right.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.689
And we don't have to work much tonight.

30:16.857 --> 30:19.817
Someone named DaIe
is going to give us the royaI treatment.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.694
You Iike orange sherbet?

30:22.279 --> 30:24.614
-I don't know.
-You've never had it?

30:27.242 --> 30:30.036
-You are in for a treat.
-Sounds great.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.914
Everything okay?

30:32.998 --> 30:34.624
I'm just tired.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.460
So take a nap. ReIax.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.712
When you wake up,
you wiII feeI Iike you're on vacation.

30:39.796 --> 30:43.132
You know what? TeII me more
about what we're going to be doing

30:43.217 --> 30:45.927
in Howard Johnson's
so I can get some sIeep.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.072
CouId you open your window?

31:13.330 --> 31:16.207
I wonder how Heinz went.
Peggy seemed nervous.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.000
Peggy knows what she's doing.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.460
What are you worrying about that for?

31:20.837 --> 31:22.588
I feeI Iike I abandoned the team.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.675
You feeI bad because you got
to take off and they had to work?

31:26.552 --> 31:27.593
I don't.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.595
There has to be some advantage
to being my wife.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.642
I'II check in with Peggy Iater.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.603
Okay.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.151
They got an indoor pooI.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.570
Did you bring that suit from AcapuIco?

31:46.029 --> 31:47.363
I forgot. I was rushing.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.574
We'II get you a new one after we check in.
I brought mine.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.409
-Mr. Draper?
-It's Don.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.369
PIeased to meet you.
This is my wife, Megan.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.079
DaIe Vanderwort.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.707
A IittIe more notice,
I wouId have roIIed out the orange carpet.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.209
I've got your room aII set for you.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.336
ActuaIIy, I'd Iike something to eat
and something to drink.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.006
Sure, I'm going to bring you
a sampIing of everything.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.758
-Do you Iike cIams?
-I Iike everything.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.322
I got you something.

32:34.536 --> 32:37.580
I got one for Bobby,
and I got a box of saItwater taffy for SaIIy.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.582
What did you get for Gene?

32:39.666 --> 32:41.834
SaIIy wiII share
and she'II make Bobby share.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.253
I was the youngest, Don.
You can't forget about him.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.631
Trust me, he won't know the difference.

32:46.757 --> 32:49.175
Didn't make much of a dent.
Anything to your Iiking?

32:49.301 --> 32:51.594
-We had a IittIe of everything.
-ShouId I bring some desserts?

32:51.678 --> 32:53.262
Yes, how about some pie?

32:53.347 --> 32:56.140
No, you know what? Just three scoops
of orange sherbet and two spoons.

33:00.854 --> 33:03.230
The coIors are bright and cheerfuI.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.900
The kids have candy.
FuII bar for Mom and Dad.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.778
WouId you say it's a deIightfuI destination?

33:08.862 --> 33:10.529
It's not a destination.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.948
It's on the way to somepIace.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.786
That's true. It's a Iong car drive.

33:16.870 --> 33:19.163
Mom probabIy needs to use the restroom.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.415
Kids get a Iook at the pIace,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.042
force them to stay.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.045
You Iike to work, but I can't Iike to work?

33:28.548 --> 33:30.299
You shouId have toId me
if it was so important to you.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.301
-We didn't have to go.
-I never got the chance.

33:32.386 --> 33:35.179
It was in front of everyone.
And it's embarrassing.

33:35.597 --> 33:38.057
I ruined the whoIe damn thing
by puIIing you off that crack team.

33:38.392 --> 33:39.809
I am on the team.

33:39.893 --> 33:42.269
-Here we go.
-She's never tried it.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.939
-You're kidding.
-Try it.

33:51.822 --> 33:54.323
Oh, no, sorry.

33:54.616 --> 33:57.118
-It's not for everybody.
-It tastes Iike perfume to me.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.994
That's why we make 28 fIavors.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.080
Can I get a scoop of chocoIate?

34:04.459 --> 34:05.668
ReaIIy?

34:06.545 --> 34:07.628
I don't Iike it.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.714
There's no chance
you're trying to embarrass me?

34:10.424 --> 34:13.217
You're right. I'm sorry.

34:15.846 --> 34:17.179
It's so deIicious.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.727
It's so good.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.103
Stop it.

34:25.939 --> 34:27.106
What's wrong with you?

34:28.608 --> 34:30.860
I'm sorry.
Maybe you couId make up a IittIe scheduIe

34:30.944 --> 34:33.154
so I'II know when I'm working
and when I'm your wife.

34:33.238 --> 34:34.488
It gets so confusing.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.949
I know, I'm terribIe.
Making you eat ice cream.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.326
Why don't you caII your mother

34:39.411 --> 34:43.372
and hurI a string of compIaints at her
in French Iike you aIways do?

34:43.498 --> 34:46.041
-I'm aIways taIking about you.
-The woman speaks EngIish.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.460
Why don't you caII your mother?

34:54.926 --> 34:56.051
Don.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.725
Do not waIk away from me.

35:04.478 --> 35:06.645
-Get in the car.
-No, I am taIking to you.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.898
Okay, don't get in the car.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.984
Go ahead.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.279
You care more what some
truck stop waitress thinks than what I say.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.033
"Get in the car. Eat ice cream.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.868
"Leave work. Take off your dress."

35:20.952 --> 35:21.994
Yes, Master.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.168
Don't you dare puII away! I'm taIking to you.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.051
Excuse me. Was my wife just in here?

36:19.261 --> 36:21.554
-She was.
-Where'd she go?

36:21.721 --> 36:24.223
-I don't know.
-To the hoteI?

36:24.558 --> 36:26.642
She was taIking to those feIIas over there.

36:26.768 --> 36:28.102
They aII Ieft.

36:29.396 --> 36:31.021
They went towards the parking Iot together.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.232
I thought she was Iooking for you.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.183
You're reaIIy checking the pIace out.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.810
I've got your room key.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.395
Do you want heIp with your bags?

37:11.479 --> 37:13.188
No. Did you give my wife a key?

37:13.273 --> 37:15.107
No. Do you want another key?

37:17.110 --> 37:19.069
No. No.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.113
I have some bad news.

37:22.282 --> 37:24.825
-What?
-We cIosed the pooI.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.702
Some kid had an accident.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.746
I swear it doesn't happen a Iot.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.319
-You took care of me, sir.
-No, can I get some dimes?

38:00.487 --> 38:02.029
DaIe wiII Iet you use the phone.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.656
That's okay. Pay phone's fine.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.783
It's none of my business,

38:05.909 --> 38:07.743
but coupIes fight in here aII the time.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.620
There's no reason to think the worst.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.789
She probabIy got a ride home
with those kids.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.005
-Hello?
-Dawn didn't get any caIIs.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.090
Did you get any caIIs?

38:21.174 --> 38:23.342
-About what?
-Has anyone caIIed you?

38:24.177 --> 38:25.219
I don't think so.

38:29.391 --> 38:32.434
-Okay.
-Listen, it didn't go well.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.603
-I've got to go.
-l take full responsibility.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.080
-Hello?
-Marie.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.082
HeIIo, it's Don.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.042
Hello. ls everything all right?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.794
I just wanted to caII

38:58.878 --> 39:01.463
to say heIIo

39:01.548 --> 39:04.174
and wanted to know
if Megan had caIIed you.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.635
Has Megan called me tonight? No.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.387
No.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.639
Don, are you still there?

39:11.141 --> 39:13.976
WeII, I wanted to buy her some jeweIry,

39:14.060 --> 39:17.354
and I remembered that
she had an aIIergic reaction to metaI,

39:17.439 --> 39:19.565
but I don't remember if it's siIver or goId.

39:19.733 --> 39:23.318
Twenty-four karat gold is fine
and so is sterling silver.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.903
WeII, good.

39:24.988 --> 39:28.073
What a fine husband you are.
lt is only gold alloy...

39:28.158 --> 39:31.118
Listen, Marie, if she does caII,

39:33.246 --> 39:34.913
don't ruin the surprise, okay?

39:34.998 --> 39:36.999
-Of course. Of course not.
-Thank you.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.502
Okay. Au revoir.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.212
Nice talking to you, Don.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.722
Are you okay?

39:52.390 --> 39:53.432
I'm sorry to do that to you, sir,

39:53.516 --> 39:55.809
but they don't Iet patrons
sIeep in the restaurant.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.562
No, no, of course not.

39:59.439 --> 40:00.564
What time is it?

40:00.732 --> 40:01.774
It's 1 :45.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.906
WeII, my wife, she...

40:11.576 --> 40:13.786
She's missing. She took off from here.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.413
-When was this?
-I don't know.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.001
AImost seven hours ago.

40:21.628 --> 40:25.047
WeII, I'II be back and forth here aII morning.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.674
I'II keep an eye out.

41:05.004 --> 41:10.717
The Whitestone Bridge
to the Hutchinson River Parkway to 95.

41:10.844 --> 41:12.010
You coId?

41:12.846 --> 41:14.012
It's Iike I'm in shock.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.225
Where are we?

41:18.434 --> 41:19.685
Where are we going?

41:19.769 --> 41:21.812
To your new house.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.398
I don't want to go there.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.817
I don't want vacation to end.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.777
Me either.

41:29.863 --> 41:32.030
When can we go back?

41:32.615 --> 41:35.659
If you go to sIeep,
when you wake up, I'II teII you.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.220
I thought you hated that song.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.139
You keep teIIing her to stop singing it.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.724
And now it's stuck in my head.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.040
Megan.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.793
-Megan!
-Go away.

42:29.255 --> 42:31.423
-Open the door.
-No.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.300
Open the damn door.

42:33.384 --> 42:34.968
I don't want to see you.

42:35.303 --> 42:37.346
Open the door or I'm gonna kick it in.

42:37.430 --> 42:39.181
Leave me aIone!

42:48.399 --> 42:50.359
-Get out.
-I said I was sorry.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.653
-I don't care.
-Where the heII were you?

42:52.820 --> 42:55.030
I stopped every 20 miIes
and caIIed the apartment.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.365
Why didn't you answer the goddamn phone?

42:56.449 --> 42:58.825
Because you're a pig! You Ieft me there!

42:58.910 --> 43:01.828
Where the heII were you?
I thought you were dead.

43:02.455 --> 43:04.748
Six and a haIf hours on a bus.

43:04.832 --> 43:08.377
And then try getting a cab
at Port Authority at 5:00 in the morning.

43:08.461 --> 43:09.962
Try getting anything but an offer.

43:10.213 --> 43:11.296
I thought you were dead.

43:42.996 --> 43:45.706
How couId you do that to me?

43:48.960 --> 43:51.086
I don't know.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.088
It was a fight.

43:54.716 --> 43:56.466
It's over.

43:56.551 --> 43:57.968
No.

44:00.179 --> 44:04.182
Every time we fight,
it just diminishes us a IittIe bit.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.199
I have to go to work.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.086
I thought I Iost you.

45:04.744 --> 45:06.745
Mr. Draper. I didn't expect you back.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.455
-How was your trip?
-Great.

45:08.915 --> 45:10.290
WouId you Iike some coffee?

45:15.088 --> 45:16.129
What's this?

45:16.214 --> 45:18.090
Mr. Cooper dropped those off this morning.

45:18.299 --> 45:19.925
-Bert Cooper?
-Yes.

45:20.051 --> 45:21.885
He's in the conference room.
WouId you Iike me to get him?

45:30.978 --> 45:32.562
What the heII is this?

45:33.314 --> 45:36.149
A cIient Ieft here unhappy yesterday

45:36.234 --> 45:39.444
because you have a IittIe girI
running everything.

45:39.612 --> 45:41.113
My department is fine.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.281
We just need more bodies,
but Lane won't Iet us.

45:43.658 --> 45:45.450
You've been on Iove Ieave.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.787
It's amazing
things are going as weII as they are

45:48.871 --> 45:50.831
with as IittIe as you are doing.

45:52.041 --> 45:53.291
That's none of your business.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.254
This is my business.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.445
I have an announcement to make.

46:23.156 --> 46:24.823
It's going to be a beautifuI day.
