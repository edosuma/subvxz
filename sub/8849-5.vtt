16:03.530 --> 16:07.234

16:07.267 --> 16:09.202
WELL, GO ON.
SHIT AIN'T GONNA CHEW ITSELF.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.575

SAY THE WORD.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.077
I'LL TALK TO PSALMS.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.212
- NO MONEY. ROTTEN FOOD.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.081
16-HOUR DAYS.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.151
I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE REASON
WHY NOT.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.219
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU TOIL
LIKE THAT DUSK 'TIL DAWN.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.055

16:37.197 --> 16:39.166
[spits]

DOWN BY THE BORDER?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.475

16:48.508 --> 16:53.113

16:53.146 --> 16:54.347
THAT CAN TURN
INTO A DEATH CERTIFICATE,

16:54.381 --> 16:56.083
YOU AIN'T CAREFUL.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.218
- I AIN'T CROSSED NO ONE
I CAN'T HANDLE YET.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.253
- IS THAT WHAT YOU DID
DOWN IN MEXICO?

17:00.287 --> 17:01.654
HANDLE THINGS?

17:03.456 --> 17:06.459
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN ROPE BURNS
ON A LIVE MAN BEFORE.

17:06.493 --> 17:10.130
- I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'

17:10.163 --> 17:13.466
UNLESS A MISUNDERSTANDIN' WITH

THE STRAW FOR A NICKEL A NIGHT.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.418

20:27.860 --> 20:31.731
I APOLOGIZE IF WE ARE BORING YOU
WITH OLD TIMES.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.434
- IT REMINDS ME OF HOME,
ACTUALLY.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.536
- MM. NAOMI'S FATHER
HEADS A MORMON MILITIA

20:36.569 --> 20:38.305
AT A WARD SOME WAYS NORTH.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.406

20:43.410 --> 20:47.414
RECKON I'D LIKE TO MEET THAT MAN

20:50.450 --> 20:51.718
YOU MEAN BESIDES YOUR HUSBAND.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.926
HE EVER SPOKE
ON LUFTON'S CROSSING?

20:59.959 --> 21:02.329
- MM-MM. MY HUSBAND
DOESN'T SPEAK ON THE WAR.

21:02.329 --> 21:05.498
- APOLOGIES. I ONLY--'CAUSE YOU
SAID YOU WERE ACCUSTOMED.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.334
- NO NEED TO STOP

21:10.437 --> 21:12.472
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE AIN'T TOLD YOU THIS ALREADY.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.941
IT WAS THE BEST DAY
OF OUR LIVES.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.844
IT WAS JUNE OF '64, AND WE COME
ACROSS THIS EMPTY TRAIN

21:17.877 --> 21:20.347
AT A WHISTLE STOP
IN BACKWOODS VIRGINIA.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.383
IT WAS THE DEFINITION
OF A SITTING DUCK.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.386
BUT WHEN WE GET INSIDE--NOW,
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS PART--

21:26.419 --> 21:28.955
WHEN WE GET INSIDE,
IT'S A MEDICAL TRAIN.

21:28.988 --> 21:32.359
AND IT'S NOT EMPTY.
IT'S PILED UP WITH YANKEES.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.528
THEY ALL HOBBLED UP ON COTS.
THEY'RE CRYIN' TO THEIR MAMAS.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.497
THEY AIN'T GOT A GUN, NOTHIN'.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.533
WE JUMP A COUPLE SENTRIES,
AND THEN IT'S JUST BAM...

21:40.567 --> 21:43.370
BAM...BAM...

21:43.370 --> 21:44.771

21:44.804 --> 21:46.739
ALL DEAD.

21:46.773 --> 21:50.377

THE WAR ENDED.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.814
- [chuckles]

21:54.847 --> 21:56.783
DAMN, BOHANNON,

22:27.847 --> 22:31.718
- I'VE BEEN TASKED
TO BRING ORDER TO THIS CITY

22:31.751 --> 22:33.786
BY THE NEXT PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.689
- YOU SAY YOU BRING ORDER,

22:36.723 --> 22:41.027
YET MEN HANG FROM SALOON RAFTERS
AND LAMPPOSTS.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.597
- LYNCH, BURN, BLUDGEON,
OR BURY--

22:44.631 --> 22:48.801
I WILL DO WHATEVER'S NECESSARY
TO RID THIS CITY OF CORRUPTION,

22:48.835 --> 22:50.703
THEN SEIZE YOUR RAILROAD.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.540
- SEIZE MY RAILROAD?

22:56.509 --> 22:58.445
ARE YOU HAVING HEADACHES, JOHN?

22:58.445 --> 22:59.946
- HUH?

22:59.979 --> 23:02.482

23:06.486 --> 23:09.889

23:09.922 --> 23:14.561
YOU SEE, OCULAR MALFORMATIONS

23:14.594 --> 23:17.797
CAN INHIBIT MENTAL PROCESSES,

23:17.830 --> 23:20.800
CLOUDING ONE'S SIGHT,

23:20.833 --> 23:23.603
LEAVING ONE DELUSIONAL.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.638
- MY VISION IS PERFECTLY CLEAR.

23:25.672 --> 23:29.876
IN FACT, I CAN SEE
INTO THE FUTURE, DOCTOR.

23:31.778 --> 23:35.515
YOU'RE NOT IN IT.

23:35.548 --> 23:39.586
- ONE MOMENT, THE WORLD
IS AS CLEAR AS DAY.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.953
THE NEXT...
[snaps fingers]

23:40.987 --> 23:43.623
IT FLASHES TO BLACK.

23:43.656 --> 23:47.560

23:47.594 --> 23:51.097
[laughs]

23:53.700 --> 23:55.768
FIRST YOUR CITY,

23:55.802 --> 23:58.137

24:19.692 --> 24:21.961
[spits]

24:21.994 --> 24:24.030
[wood creaks]

24:59.165 --> 25:01.167
- [screams]

25:47.947 --> 25:51.751
- ON THE OLD HOUSE, AS IT WERE.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.833
[knock at door]

26:49.275 --> 26:53.880
- I KNOW YOU REMEMBER
THAT TRAIN.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.748
- AND I KNOW YOU GOT HOUNDS
ON YOUR HEELS

26:55.782 --> 26:57.717
FOR SOMETHIN'
YOU DONE OVER THE BORDER.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.286
HMM?

27:00.319 --> 27:02.789
YOU KEEP A GUN WITHIN REACH,
YOUR HEAD ON A SWIVEL,

27:02.822 --> 27:04.857
AND THE ONLY TIME I SEEN PISTOLS
PLATED IN SILVER

27:04.891 --> 27:06.693
WAS ON MAN
TANGLED WITH MEXICANS.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.696
THEN YOU SPOKE LIKE YOU DONE
AT DINNER IN FRONT OF MY WIFE?

27:09.696 --> 27:10.897
- ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS,

27:10.930 --> 27:14.166
NOBODY FINDIN' ME HERE,
BOHANNON.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.068

27:16.102 --> 27:19.972
- THEY AFTER THE BOUNTY,
I RECKON.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.709
AIN'T NOBODY FINDIN' ME.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.878
- YOU NEED MONEY,
I'LL SPARE MY LAST.

27:25.912 --> 27:29.115
SOMEBODY COMES LOOKIN' FOR YA,
I'LL KEEP A TIGHT LIP.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.884
BUT AS FOR A PLACE TO STAY?

27:31.918 --> 27:33.920
GOT TO BE NO.

27:33.953 --> 27:38.725
- SOUTHERN MAN DON'T OPEN HIS
HOME, THEN DISHONOR HIS WORD.

27:38.725 --> 27:42.829
- I GOT FAMILY INSIDE.
I WON'T RISK IT.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.764
- RISK WHAT--

27:44.797 --> 27:46.733
YOUR JOB CHUCKIN' ROCKS
WITH NIGGERS,

27:46.733 --> 27:49.736
THIS SHIT-SPLATTERED TENT
WITH RATS?

27:49.736 --> 27:51.003
HELL, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.805
THAT LITTLE MORMON WENCH

27:52.839 --> 27:55.207
HAS GOT YOUR BALLS PRESSED TIGHT
BETWEEN THE PAGES OF HER BIBLE.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.410
- MY WIFE'S NAME IS NAOMI.

28:02.849 --> 28:06.118
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU, BOHANNON.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.988
YOU CARRY THE WORRYING SHARE
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

28:11.791 --> 28:12.892
ADIOS.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.767
- COME ON.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.870
- SIDNEY NEVER CAME BACK?

28:57.904 --> 29:00.907
- HE'S PROBABLY HALFWAY
TO DENVER BY NOW.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.314
- PART OF YOU WISHES
YOU WERE RIDIN' WITH HIM.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.929
- SIDNEY SPOKE TRUE
ABOUT THAT TRAIN LAST NIGHT.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.168
SICK AND WOUNDED...

29:29.201 --> 29:32.972
KILLED 'EM ALL...

29:33.005 --> 29:34.841
THE DOCTORS TOO.

29:38.911 --> 29:43.215
I CAN'T MAKE SENSE OF IT.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.151
CAN'T.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.856
WE WAS TIRED OF LOSIN' THE WAR.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.461
MEN LIKE SIDNEY--

29:55.494 --> 29:59.031
THEY LIKE TO THINK
WE WON SOMETHIN' THAT DAY.

29:59.065 --> 30:02.134
ME, I JUST...

30:02.168 --> 30:05.137
ALL I CAN REMEMBER IS,
AFTER IT WAS OVER,

30:05.171 --> 30:07.506
HOW HOT MY GUN WAS.

30:09.976 --> 30:14.881
SMELLED LIKE BLOOD
AND HONEYSUCKLE.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.988
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SIDNEY...

30:24.957 --> 30:27.393
YEAH.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.495
I AIN'T NO BETTER THAN HIM.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.065
- NO, THAT'S YOUR MISTAKE.

30:39.605 --> 30:42.041
- ALL THE PEOPLE
I COULD LOSE MONEY TO,

30:42.074 --> 30:44.376
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TOPS MY LIST.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.023
- FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM
"DRAWING DEAD"?

30:57.056 --> 30:59.892
- HONEY,
I'M ALWAYS DRAWIN' LIVE.

30:59.926 --> 31:02.929
IF I WERE TO DIE, I RECKON
I'D USE MY LAST BREATH ON YOU.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.235
I BET IT ALL.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.947
AIN'T FAIR TO TAKE A MAN'S MONEY
AND RUN.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.950
- YOU AIN'T POSITIONED TO BE
GIVIN' LESSONS ON WHAT'S FAIR,

31:23.950 --> 31:26.185
NOW, IS YOU?

31:26.218 --> 31:28.120

31:46.505 --> 31:50.142

32:07.994 --> 32:10.262
- SEÑOR SNOW, MANOS ARRIBA.

QUIERO VER TU CARA.

33:29.208 --> 33:32.478
Y AHORA DIME
TUS ULTIMAS PALABRAS.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.714
- LA VIDA ES UN MISTERIO.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.518
- [screams]

33:41.220 --> 33:42.754
- ANY LAST WORDS?

33:46.392 --> 33:48.094
[running footsteps]

34:16.655 --> 34:18.457

[baby fusses]

34:38.210 --> 34:40.779
- [sighs]

34:48.587 --> 34:52.491

36:02.461 --> 36:05.697
LION OF THE LORD.

36:07.733 --> 36:12.604
I BOW DOWN BEFORE YOUR GLORY.

36:12.638 --> 36:16.242
- BE ADVISED...

36:16.275 --> 36:19.845
MY HAND WILL FALL
WITH THE MIGHT OF GOD'S FIST

36:19.878 --> 36:22.481
SHOULD HE REVEAL
A NECESSARY JUDGMENT TODAY.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.818
- I ACCEPT YOUR JUDGMENT...

36:26.852 --> 36:29.355
AS HEAVENLY FATHER'S OWN.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.922
- BROTHER HATCH CHARGES

36:30.956 --> 36:34.560
YOU PRESIDED OVER THIS WARD
AS AN IMPOSTOR

36:34.593 --> 36:37.429
AFTER MURDERING BISHOP
JOSEPH DUTSON AND HIS FAMILY.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.631
HOW DO YOU MEET THESE CHARGES?

36:39.665 --> 36:43.769
- I AM A FORMER IMMIGRANT...

36:45.404 --> 36:47.606
A SOLDIER,

36:47.639 --> 36:50.409
PRISONER OF WAR.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.344
I WAS BORN

36:52.378 --> 36:56.715
AND HAVE REMAINED
TO THIS DAY A PILGRIM,

36:56.748 --> 37:00.852
A LONE MAN ON AN--ON AN EXODUS

37:00.886 --> 37:05.291
WEST TO THE PROMISED LAND,

37:05.291 --> 37:08.560
CAST OUT OF EVERY HOME
I HAVE FOUND

37:08.594 --> 37:12.531
AS A--AS A LEPER.

37:12.564 --> 37:16.435
MY TIME AS FATHER
OF THIS WARD--

37:16.468 --> 37:20.772
IT'S ALREADY
FOSTERED A MIRACLE.

37:20.806 --> 37:24.376
MY MIRACLE IS CULLEN BOHANNON--

37:24.410 --> 37:27.313
A MAN WHO CAST ME OUT,

37:27.346 --> 37:29.848
TRIED TO KILL ME,

37:29.881 --> 37:32.851
WAS BROUGHT TO THIS WARD

37:32.884 --> 37:35.854
BY THE HAND OF GOD
TO BE SAVED.

37:35.887 --> 37:38.424
AND AFTER A WINTER
OF SPIRITUAL HEALING,

37:38.457 --> 37:42.394
THIS GENTILE, SINNER,
KILLER, SLAVER

37:42.428 --> 37:45.764
FELL TO HIS KNEES

37:45.797 --> 37:49.335
AND BEGGED FOR FORGIVENESS.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.705
IF THAT IS NOT

37:53.739 --> 37:58.577
DIVINE PROVIDENCE OF GOD...

37:58.610 --> 38:01.780
THEN, BROTHER...

38:01.813 --> 38:03.515
HANG ME.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.588
- I BELIEVE FATHER'S LIPS
HAVE NOT PURSED AT YOUR EAR,

38:09.621 --> 38:11.790
NOR HIS HANDS LAID
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.826
YOU APPEAR NOTHING
MORE THAN A RAVENING WOLF.

38:14.860 --> 38:19.398
WHAT YOU STAND ACCUSED OF,
SPILLING THE BLOOD OF A SAINT,

38:19.431 --> 38:22.668
IS A HEINOUS, SINFUL CRIME

38:22.701 --> 38:24.503
WHOSE JUST PUNISHMENT

38:24.536 --> 38:28.374
MUST BE OF EQUAL WEIGHT
AND MEASURE.

38:32.544 --> 38:33.379
- YES.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.648
- [sighs]

38:36.682 --> 38:41.520
AND YET THE SPUR LINE,

38:41.553 --> 38:44.523
WHICH PROVES ESSENTIAL
TO THE SAINT'S JOURNEY WEST

38:44.556 --> 38:45.557
TO THE PROMISED LAND,

38:45.591 --> 38:48.494
HAS MADE TWICE THE PROGRESS
UNDER YOUR TENURE

38:48.527 --> 38:51.397
THAN IT DID
UNDER YOUR PREDECESSOR.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.633
YOU WORKED
ON THE GENTILE'S ROAD?

38:54.666 --> 38:56.935
- UNDER THOMAS DURANT,
HEAD OF--

38:56.968 --> 39:00.606
- I KNOW WHO HE IS.

39:00.639 --> 39:03.609
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE MAN?

39:03.642 --> 39:06.545
- I HATED HIM

39:06.578 --> 39:10.849
WITH THE FIRE
OF A THOUSAND SUNS.

39:17.489 --> 39:20.692
- PERHAPS HEAVENLY FATHER
HAS A USE FOR YOU YET.

39:30.436 --> 39:34.105
- THAT MAN SHOT A CHILD.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.545
- HE'LL KNOW JUSTICE.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.780
- OUR SON WAS NEXT.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.084
- HEY.

39:46.117 --> 39:49.087
HEY.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.458
I WOULDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.461
- I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.407
I WASN'T GOING TO SHOOT HER AND
YOU KNOW IT.

40:12.544 --> 40:15.947
SAME I KNEW
YOU WASN'T GONNA SHOOT ME.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.749
- HMM.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.818
I WISHED I HAD.

40:19.851 --> 40:23.689
- THAT AIN'T SO, BOHANNON.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.791
TRUTH IS, YOU EVEN WISH
YOU WERE IN HERE WITH ME,

40:25.824 --> 40:29.094
WAITIN' FOR SOMEONE LIKE US
TO BUST US OUT.

40:31.029 --> 40:34.700
THAT'S IT, AIN'T IT?

40:34.733 --> 40:36.434
YOU MISS IT.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.007
- I'LL BE GLAD
TO WATCH YOU HANG.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.544
- NAH, I'VE BEEN HUNG BEFORE.

40:45.577 --> 40:48.714
LIFE SURE IS A MYSTERY,
AIN'T IT, BOHANNON?

40:54.586 --> 40:57.455
[door opens, closes]

41:18.677 --> 41:20.612
- OH.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.849
ANY BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNOR
WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING.

41:23.882 --> 41:27.853
- TELL ME WHY YOU DID IT.
- DID WHAT?

41:27.886 --> 41:29.988
- JESSUP IS DEAD.

41:32.157 --> 41:35.961
- I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.168
- I LOVED HIM.

41:46.605 --> 41:49.708
- YOU LOVED HIM?

41:52.711 --> 41:54.880
OH, I SEE.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.616
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS
YOU THINK I'VE DONE,

41:57.649 --> 41:59.818
I CAN ASSURE YOU,
YOU ARE WRONG.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.688
- STOP LYING.
