34:39.973 --> 34:44.845

A DINNER PARTY TO ATTEND.

34:44.845 --> 34:47.180

LOSE MY APPETITE.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.783

34:55.556 --> 34:57.323

DRIVE ME FURTHER

THAT'S A NICE DEFENSE?

35:08.108 --> 35:11.912
YES, THAT WOULD BE
APPROPRIATE.

35:11.912 --> 35:14.214

THAT TO MY SON?

FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

SO TELL ME ABOUT THE GUY
THAT WAS IN THE CELL WITH HIM.

35:55.488 --> 35:56.990
HE WAS MURDERED
IN HIS CELL.

36:20.186 --> 36:22.989
MURDER.
NOT RAPE?

36:22.989 --> 36:24.324
YES.

36:24.324 --> 36:28.228
DID YOU PUT HIM
IN THE CELL WITH MY SON?

36:28.228 --> 36:31.998
AND YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT WYATT
WOULD BE ASSAULTED BY HIM?

36:31.998 --> 36:33.066
NO, I THOUGHT...

36:33.066 --> 36:38.772
WERE YOU REALLY THINKING
ANYTHING AT ALL?

36:38.772 --> 36:41.975
MY SON WAS ASSAULTED
AS A CHILD, VERONICA.

36:41.975 --> 36:43.476

SUPPOSED TO GO THAT FAR!

36:46.880 --> 36:48.749
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
WE HAD TO SCARE HIM.

36:48.749 --> 36:51.051
AND JIM HAD HIM
TOO PROTECTED IN THERE.

36:51.051 --> 36:52.485
HE WASN'T SCARED!

36:52.485 --> 36:54.054
HE WAS SCARED, VERONICA.

36:54.054 --> 36:55.656
I SAW HIM.

36:55.656 --> 36:57.758
WELL, WHEN I SAW HIM
AT THIS HOUSE,

36:57.758 --> 36:59.626
HE WAS NOT SCARED.

36:59.626 --> 37:00.927
HE WAS GOING TO THE D. A.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.202
AND I JUST WANTED HIM
NOT TO DO THAT.

37:03.202 --> 37:05.038
SO I WANTED HIM
TO BE SCARED!

37:05.038 --> 37:07.073
AS A PARENT, I KNOW
WHEN A CHILD IS SCARED.

37:07.073 --> 37:08.675
AND THAT CHILD
WAS NOT SCARED.

37:08.675 --> 37:10.343
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I'M A BAD PARENT?

37:10.343 --> 37:11.811
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M SAYING!

37:11.811 --> 37:13.046

PLEASE?

37:13.046 --> 37:15.014

IF YOU DON'T MIND.

TO BE FRIGHTENED.

37:22.723 --> 37:25.325
AND JIM WASN'T DOING THAT.

37:25.325 --> 37:28.662
HE NEEDED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS
REALLY LIKE IN THERE.

37:28.662 --> 37:30.831
THAT WAS
THE ONLY WAY, KATHERYN.

37:32.933 --> 37:36.202

YOUR PLAN WORK OUT?

37:40.040 --> 37:42.709

37:42.709 --> 37:44.845

37:44.845 --> 37:48.148

TO HURT HIM INTENTIONALLY.

YOUR MOTHER WAS A WHORE.

39:16.683 --> 39:18.284
AND YOUR FATHER?

39:18.284 --> 39:20.587
HE PLAYED THE NUMBERS
AND THE WOMEN.

39:20.587 --> 39:23.590
HE AND JIM HAVE THAT
IN COMMON.

39:23.590 --> 39:27.926
YOU'RE ONE OF FIVE CHILDREN,

39:29.830 --> 39:32.198
YOU WERE SMART IN COLLEGE.

39:32.198 --> 39:36.269
BUT YOU NEEDED TO GET
THAT SCHOLARSHIP FROM MY FATHER.

39:36.269 --> 39:40.240
WE ALL KNOW WHAT YOU HAD
TO DO TO GET THAT.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.976
THAT MUST'VE BEEN DISGUSTING.

39:42.976 --> 39:45.812
HE WAS OLD AND WRINKLED
BY THAT POINT.

39:47.413 --> 39:51.351
ON PAPER, YOU'RE WORTH
ABOUT $25 MILLION.

39:51.351 --> 39:53.386

ON THOSE FACILITIES

39:53.386 --> 39:56.489
