00:46.610 --> 00:48.993
Maria Enders will not be doing Jakarta.

00:49.046 --> 00:50.495
Or Lima.
No, no.

00:51.741 --> 00:54.693
Yes, it's okay for Annie Leibovitz
to shoot; but just for that one day.

00:54.797 --> 00:56.721
And in New York,
like we agreed?

00:58.654 --> 01:00.854
Yes, I know it will be tight.
I'm sorry about that.

01:00.893 --> 01:01.904
Um...

01:01.933 --> 01:02.950
Hey, you...

01:02.975 --> 01:05.071
you're gonna have to excuse me.
I have to jump to another call.

01:05.096 --> 01:07.551
Get, get back to me
by tomorrow, alright?

01:07.664 --> 01:08.820
Okay.

01:10.767 --> 01:11.852
Hello?

01:11.926 --> 01:13.856
Yes, this is Valentine,
Maria per...uh...

01:13.891 --> 01:16.405
Maria... Maria Enders'
personal assistant.

01:20.834 --> 01:23.274
Yeah, we, we received
the date of the hearing, but...

01:23.334 --> 01:27.083
she will not be in Paris that day.
We, we told the lawyer two times.

01:29.747 --> 01:32.530
She's the one who filed for divorce.

01:32.563 --> 01:36.050
Why would she be holding things up?
That's, that's ridiculous.

01:37.270 --> 01:38.777
Okay.
Well, we're gonna...

01:38.910 --> 01:39.931
Hel...

01:40.270 --> 01:41.486
Hello?

01:42.058 --> 01:43.873
I'm sorry.
We're, we're, we're in...

01:48.670 --> 01:49.723
Hello?

01:50.331 --> 01:51.767
I'm sorry,
I can barely...

01:51.793 --> 01:53.587
We're, we're just...
we're, we're on a train,

01:53.614 --> 01:55.181
and I'm not sure if I...

01:55.253 --> 01:56.447
Fuck!!

02:00.916 --> 02:02.129
Hello?

02:04.149 --> 02:06.845
Aaahh.
No, I still can't. I um...

02:07.025 --> 02:08.025
We're in the Alps.

02:08.059 --> 02:10.538
There's tons of mountains
and tunnels, and I...

02:10.616 --> 02:11.785
Yeah...

02:17.410 --> 02:22.150
Did you read this article about Google
and users' private information? It's...

02:22.396 --> 02:24.539
disgraceful.
They're too powerful.

02:24.592 --> 02:25.606
Thanks.

02:25.639 --> 02:27.572
So, I have no service in here
because of all the tunnels.

02:27.619 --> 02:28.979
But, I did reach Gwen.

02:29.026 --> 02:31.662
She said that she's gonna take
the "X-Men" thing off IMDB.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.985
I did one.
That was enough.

02:33.025 --> 02:35.149
Nor am I playing Nemesis again.

02:35.536 --> 02:37.712
Well, they have to do it now
because uh...

02:37.755 --> 02:39.272
everyone's blogging about it already.

02:39.298 --> 02:43.065
Yeah, I'm sick of acting hanging
from wires in front of green screens.

02:43.132 --> 02:44.735
I've outgrown it.

02:45.168 --> 02:47.115
Fans are gonna be devastated.

02:47.188 --> 02:49.488
Oh, did you speak to um...

02:49.704 --> 02:50.761
What's his name?
Uh...

02:50.794 --> 02:52.551
- Urs.
- Urs, Urs Cobler?

02:52.584 --> 02:54.234
- Yeah.
- Is the genda set for tonight?

02:54.259 --> 02:55.302
Yeah, you're all set.

02:55.327 --> 02:56.780
You have just the three interviews.

02:56.807 --> 02:58.617
And then this presentation
of the award,

02:58.657 --> 03:00.017
and the official dinner.

03:00.164 --> 03:01.740
He's gonna meet us
at the train station

03:01.777 --> 03:04.960
and starts to take us
to the Dolder... der... Dolder.

03:05.857 --> 03:07.717
That, that's where
you want to stay, right?

03:07.774 --> 03:09.877
I've written the first draft.
Wanna hear it?

03:09.917 --> 03:10.991
Sure.

03:15.335 --> 03:17.818
"I'm very honored that
Wilhelm Melchior asked me

03:17.858 --> 03:20.758
to accept the prize
you're awading him tonight.

03:21.105 --> 03:23.359
As you all know,
he decided a long ago

03:23.396 --> 03:25.439
to stay away from
all public events.

03:25.552 --> 03:29.326
Not because he's shy or proud,
he's a modest and generous man.

03:29.401 --> 03:33.401
But, he insists on protecting
the peace and quiet he needs to write.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.521
I wish that I could
promise you all that

03:35.554 --> 03:38.541
I, myself, would place
this prize in hands.

03:39.021 --> 03:41.107
But, Wilhelm has forbidden me to do so.

03:41.151 --> 03:44.061
He asked me to join him,
tomorrow in Sils Maria,

03:44.121 --> 03:45.921
where he lives for part of the year,

03:45.948 --> 03:49.341
but on one condition:
That I come empty-handed.

03:51.521 --> 03:54.617
If I'm here tonight,
it's because I owe everything to him.

03:54.730 --> 03:57.551
He chose an unknown
18 year old actress

03:57.577 --> 04:00.353
for the lead in the play
you've all known: Maloja Snake,

04:00.406 --> 04:01.940
and then for the film.

04:01.996 --> 04:05.013
That unknown actress
who played Sigrid was me.

04:05.310 --> 04:08.376
In two months of shooting,
he gave me everything

04:08.410 --> 04:11.822
I needed to build...
build a career on: My career.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.387
Up to here,

04:13.453 --> 04:17.272
it's fine and then it's all
downhill to fragments.

04:18.281 --> 04:19.708
You want me to finish it for you?

04:19.755 --> 04:22.335
No, I am the one who has
to pay tribute to him.

04:22.393 --> 04:23.845
I have to find my own words.

04:23.871 --> 04:25.695
If I'm stuck,
I'll ask you, okay?

04:29.448 --> 04:30.708
So, Mappy says it's gonna take

04:30.734 --> 04:33.692
about two and a half hours
to get to Sils Maria from Zurich.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.254
We have a driver.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.391
Um...

04:36.603 --> 04:38.495
Also, I texted Wilhelm's wife.

04:38.941 --> 04:40.687
She hasn't gotten back to me yet.

04:40.993 --> 04:42.727
That's not like Rosa.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.867
You sure I use,
is it the right number?

04:46.231 --> 04:47.335
- CREEP'S LAWYER
- Urgh!

04:47.361 --> 04:49.383
Perhaps, I should take this.

04:50.469 --> 04:52.706
Good evening, dear master.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.462
I told your client,
my future ex-husband.

04:59.501 --> 05:01.731
I can not come to the meeting,

05:01.764 --> 05:06.011
quite simply because I'm abroad.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.753
I know he wants to buy
my share of the apartment.

05:08.793 --> 05:11.100
And I offered him
a very reasonable price, right?

05:30.660 --> 05:34.761
Check-out the average price
per square yard in the 7th district.

05:38.398 --> 05:41.428
Yes, I am indulgent,
but I'm not stupid.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.121
I know that I'd lose out.

05:43.848 --> 05:45.201
I have to talk to you.

05:45.277 --> 05:47.737
You know the law
better than I do, right?

05:47.920 --> 05:50.446
Nobody is being forced
to stay in that area.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.893
I know, I heard.
Just a second ago.

05:52.980 --> 05:56.566
Um... I know, I know.
I haven't told her yet. But, um...

05:57.132 --> 05:58.792
As soon as I can, okay?

05:58.843 --> 06:00.609
I got it.
Yeah.

06:04.428 --> 06:08.504
If your client wants to sell and split up
the money, I have no problem with that.

06:08.551 --> 06:12.018
We'll give it to an agency tomorrow
and see what the market's like.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.327
WILHEM HAS DIED

06:34.352 --> 06:36.862
Yeah, there's really nothing
on the net yet, Just...

06:37.002 --> 06:39.648
Just this press release, and um...

06:40.881 --> 06:42.191
comments.

06:42.477 --> 06:44.565
What kind of comments?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.518
Hmm, you do not want to know...

06:46.686 --> 06:49.420
They're stupid.
It just says, you know...

06:50.699 --> 06:52.119
From Zorglub228:

06:52.239 --> 06:53.715
"I thought he died a while ago.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.257
Besides, he hasn't written anything
of interest in 20 years."

06:56.329 --> 06:59.298
WiseGuy666:
"Nobody pays much attention to writers,"

06:59.335 --> 07:03.032
"People die all over the world
and no-one ever mentions them."

07:04.008 --> 07:05.601
ZoraRose:

07:05.862 --> 07:10.289
"Didn't know who this guys was."
But, offers her condolences to the family.

07:13.164 --> 07:14.918
So, I-I spoke to Urs Kobler.

07:15.078 --> 07:17.092
We canceled the press, obviously.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.244
Menor can help me get it tonight.

07:19.724 --> 07:21.525
It's, it's gonna be really...

07:21.734 --> 07:22.744
different.

07:22.823 --> 07:24.582
It'll be gloomy

07:24.864 --> 07:26.346
Official and stiff.

07:26.424 --> 07:28.346
Everything Wilhelm hated.

07:28.563 --> 07:30.364
Yeah, people are gonna be sad.

07:30.873 --> 07:32.923
What do you expect?
He's...

07:34.219 --> 07:35.559
He's dead.

07:35.859 --> 07:39.605
If I wanted to be true to him,
I'd turn around and go home.

07:39.769 --> 07:41.668
I think you'll find the words
once you're there.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.490
I think they'll come naturally.
I think...

07:43.544 --> 07:44.897
I know.

07:45.260 --> 07:46.916
Who could do him justice
better than you?

07:46.963 --> 07:48.247
A stranger?

07:49.850 --> 07:51.050
You love him.

07:51.117 --> 07:52.510
That's different.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.430
I love him.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.146
I know so little about him.

08:00.562 --> 08:03.082
Um, you know,
you know what I mean.

08:03.558 --> 08:05.525
If you want to be true to him,...

08:06.525 --> 08:08.324
you have to spear on.

08:11.236 --> 08:12.409
Hello?

08:15.506 --> 08:17.401
Um... sure.

08:17.575 --> 08:20.089
Yeah, we're on a train,
so we might lose you, but I'll...

08:20.222 --> 08:21.562
I'll ask her.

08:25.492 --> 08:28.282
- It's France Inter.
- Oh, God.

08:30.736 --> 08:33.703
You kinda have to.
I'm sorry.

08:35.832 --> 08:36.859
Yes.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.193
Yes, with Maria Enders.

08:40.619 --> 08:42.399
Yes, I know.
Thanks.

08:52.341 --> 08:56.888
WILHEM MELCHIOR

09:00.677 --> 09:03.224
A sequel to Maloja Snake?

09:05.077 --> 09:07.323
Yes, he talked about it.

09:09.043 --> 09:12.949
He wanted me to play Sigrid
20 years later.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.027
But, I do not know
what he had in mind.

09:17.699 --> 09:21.819
He was very vague;
so I dont really know his idea.

09:24.801 --> 09:26.741
I regret it.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.554
Of course, I am sorry.

09:35.085 --> 09:36.365
Rosa just called.

09:36.665 --> 09:38.343
I, I'll call her right back.

09:38.391 --> 09:40.488
She's actually not gonna be
available 'til tonight.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.188
She's really busy.
She...

09:42.848 --> 09:45.072
She's supposed to go to the morgue.

09:45.498 --> 09:47.374
You find out everything?

09:47.685 --> 09:49.218
Yeah.
Um...

09:51.077 --> 09:53.313
Wilhem was home...
in Sils Maria.

09:53.364 --> 09:56.227
Rosa went for a check-up in Basel.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.925
She thinks that he was home
all day writing, as usual,

09:58.965 --> 10:00.422
went for a late afternoon walk,

10:00.455 --> 10:03.065
but she called to check on him,
and couldn't get through.

10:03.098 --> 10:05.268
So she got worried,
and sent the neighbors over.

10:05.301 --> 10:06.974
Doors were locked.
The lights were out.

10:07.021 --> 10:08.434
He wasn't home.

10:10.666 --> 10:12.402
When did they find him?

10:12.464 --> 10:16.416
Late afternoon,
like in the middle of nowhere...

10:16.487 --> 10:18.382
They think it was a heart attack.

10:56.287 --> 10:58.600
It's so exciting having you here.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.480
Nice.

11:01.116 --> 11:03.752
The cockroaches must've
taken a later train.

11:06.539 --> 11:08.159
Join us at the hotel.

11:08.266 --> 11:09.732
Yes, see you there.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.116
You are uh...
at a loss for words.

11:15.526 --> 11:19.129
I have to say, my first reaction
was to head right back.

11:19.882 --> 11:21.556
I understand.

11:22.128 --> 11:25.878
We were wondering is that
should we move forward or...

11:25.912 --> 11:27.752
cancel everything?

11:28.093 --> 11:30.400
You know, here in Switzerland,

11:30.467 --> 11:34.394
we are not big on public
displays of anything.

11:35.753 --> 11:37.442
Especially grief.

11:37.870 --> 11:40.467
This should have been a celebration.

11:40.520 --> 11:44.067
And now it will be
a posthumous homage.

11:44.108 --> 11:46.671
It's gonna generate the kind
of press that we do not want.

11:46.771 --> 11:48.759
We'll try to keep them at distance.

11:48.784 --> 11:51.217
Paparazzi are gonna be all over her.
You realize that, right?

11:51.311 --> 11:52.932
I have to think it over.

11:53.821 --> 11:57.046
Everything's hitting me at once;
so, I, I, I,... I don't know.

11:57.125 --> 12:00.948
Of course.
That's why we invited Henryk Wald.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.005
Henryk Wald?!

12:04.685 --> 12:05.762
Yes.

12:07.224 --> 12:10.328
He's devastated as well;
but, he agreed

12:10.368 --> 12:13.694
to hop on a plane
to be with us tonight.

12:14.347 --> 12:18.654
If you prefer not to accept the prize,
Henryk can do it.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.327
It's up to you.

12:20.775 --> 12:23.950
He's associated with
Wilhelm's theatre.

12:24.003 --> 12:26.590
Most of the plays
were written for him.

12:27.866 --> 12:29.219
You don't appreciate him?

12:29.248 --> 12:31.152
We did two films together.

12:31.220 --> 12:33.492
No, we didn't get along very well.

12:34.072 --> 12:35.931
But, I'm glad he's here.

12:36.782 --> 12:40.235
He and Wilhelm were very close
and Rosa likes him a lot.

12:40.517 --> 12:44.287
He's a...
a great actor.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.487
Yeah.

12:46.060 --> 12:48.336
One last question...

12:48.430 --> 12:50.483
Oh God, I forgot to tell you
these things, right?

12:50.510 --> 12:51.656
Chanel.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.803
Chanel.

12:52.845 --> 12:55.876
The press attachÃ© from Chanel
is waiting for you at the hotel,

12:55.931 --> 12:57.748
to try on your gown.

12:57.802 --> 13:00.977
- You don't have to.
- No, you do not have to.

13:09.154 --> 13:10.930
You can turn this off?

13:15.027 --> 13:17.170
And no fruit.
Thank you.

13:35.501 --> 13:37.848
Okay, all good.
Thank you.

13:43.726 --> 13:45.933
So, what do you think?
Will she stay?

13:45.970 --> 13:47.206
Yeah, she'll... she'll stay.

13:47.251 --> 13:49.633
Because if not,
I have to change the tickets.

13:49.673 --> 13:51.673
I know, she'll stay.
Trust me.

13:52.294 --> 13:53.702
Thank you.

13:55.887 --> 13:58.421
I can't deal with this.
It's impossible.

13:59.056 --> 14:01.439
I'll never find the right words.

14:03.981 --> 14:07.737
His body isn't even cold yet,
and everybody wants a piece of him.

14:07.771 --> 14:09.430
Starting with Henryk Wald,
of course.

14:09.517 --> 14:12.077
Of course he'd be happy
to accept the prize.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.871
The premier could just not see him.

14:16.453 --> 14:17.739
Henryk?

14:18.145 --> 14:20.013
Why are you still
so upset with him?

14:20.095 --> 14:23.008
I have no reason to have
stopped being upset with him.

14:23.085 --> 14:24.971
So, he was, like, in love
with you or something?

14:25.010 --> 14:26.813
Not at all.
He was just uh...

14:26.867 --> 14:29.306
furious I didn't give in to him.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.816
He's perverse, violent.
He hits women.

14:34.585 --> 14:36.823
He likes to humiliate them.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.956
Look it up on the internet.

14:39.561 --> 14:41.872
I thought we despised the internet.

14:43.379 --> 14:44.425
Caroline?

14:44.465 --> 14:45.741
Hey.
Valentine.

14:45.781 --> 14:46.791
Hello

14:46.818 --> 14:47.824
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:47.849 --> 14:49.169
Thanks for agreeing to do this.

14:49.209 --> 14:51.461
I know this must be
really difficult for you.

15:00.419 --> 15:01.646
Uh, this is Berndt.

15:01.699 --> 15:03.274
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

15:03.312 --> 15:04.579
Very pleased to meet you.

15:04.606 --> 15:05.888
- Nice to meet you.
- You know, those really...

15:05.922 --> 15:08.161
thrashy photos I showed you
of Lindsay Lohan?

15:08.488 --> 15:10.202
This guy's responsible.

15:10.453 --> 15:12.606
But, I'll try to be
more elegant today.

16:25.856 --> 16:27.299
It's Rosa.

16:30.044 --> 16:31.661
Am I bothering you?

16:31.976 --> 16:34.567
I just wanted to tell you...

16:35.859 --> 16:37.280
to thank you.

16:37.823 --> 16:40.623
It's good that you are there.
It's good...

16:41.895 --> 16:44.607
that you're accepting the prize.

16:44.749 --> 16:46.792
It's what Wilhelm wanted.

16:49.256 --> 16:52.712
Henryk?
No, he couldn't know.

16:53.006 --> 16:55.298
What he thought of Henryk?

16:56.217 --> 16:58.043
"The less he understands,
the better he is.

16:58.070 --> 17:00.798
When he understands nothing,
he's excellent!"

17:04.813 --> 17:07.866
I would like to give your a hug,
but,...

17:08.242 --> 17:09.736
I'm leaving.

17:10.617 --> 17:15.226
I can't stand being alone in Sils.
It's too difficult.

17:16.111 --> 17:19.358
But, there is something I...
want you...

17:19.439 --> 17:22.339
and... only you...

17:28.547 --> 17:31.128
to...
to know...

17:42.285 --> 17:45.413
So, he knew about
the illness for very long time?

17:49.068 --> 17:52.100
Did the autopsy say
what he swallowed?

17:54.781 --> 17:56.841
Oh, I see.

17:57.426 --> 17:59.681
He left nothing to chance.

18:00.815 --> 18:02.218
Beautiful.

18:02.478 --> 18:04.831
Turn your body a bit
sideways, please? Yep.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.971
Chin, chin up a little bit, please.
Thank you. Great. Yep.

18:09.114 --> 18:10.664
- Maria?
- Hmm?

18:10.814 --> 18:12.660
Sorry, it's uh...

18:12.727 --> 18:14.734
- your future ex.
- A little bit. Alright.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.829
- Hold on a second.
- Right, right. Okay.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.632
Hello?
Hello?!

18:20.589 --> 18:24.629
Spare me the somber tone.
I'm not the one who died.

18:25.214 --> 18:28.854
Yes, I know that Wilhelm's dead.
I'm in Zurich now.

18:42.431 --> 18:43.951
Maria!

18:45.351 --> 18:46.631
Maria!

18:46.806 --> 18:48.267
- This way!
- Maria!

18:48.301 --> 18:49.661
- This way.
- Maria!

18:49.709 --> 18:50.776
Maria!

18:51.204 --> 18:53.384
- The press is all here.
- I know.

18:53.430 --> 18:55.684
Are we to put them all in?

18:57.066 --> 19:00.862
What you need to know is that
we met very early at University,

19:00.919 --> 19:03.519
we proposed studying
literature and theology.

19:04.356 --> 19:05.609
Hey.

19:05.839 --> 19:08.742
And I had the privilege
of acting in all of his plays,...

19:08.782 --> 19:10.087
here and abroad.

19:10.142 --> 19:13.462
He had become reclusive,
mysterious, and inaccessible.

19:13.505 --> 19:16.081
Wilhelm was the simplest
man in the world.

19:16.841 --> 19:20.312
He liked to ski in the winter,
and go hiking in the summer.

19:20.752 --> 19:23.312
Those are the fondest
memories I have of him.

19:23.352 --> 19:26.845
His later work depicts a bleak,
destructive vision.

19:26.881 --> 19:29.299
I acted in those plays.

19:31.261 --> 19:34.927
It's true.
At times, I found them scary.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.575
A sea of gray hair.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.517
Completely.

19:45.804 --> 19:47.005
So, uh...

19:47.072 --> 19:49.200
First, I say a few words.

19:49.247 --> 19:51.474
I hope I'm up to the task.

19:51.547 --> 19:53.434
And then I introduce Henryk.

19:53.475 --> 19:57.105
Once he has finished,
he asks you to join him on stage.

19:57.151 --> 19:59.705
You introduce the film.
That's it.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.007
I saw Wilhelm two weeks ago.

20:18.831 --> 20:20.523
We went hunting.

20:22.168 --> 20:25.864
He was his usual self.
There, but not there.

20:28.989 --> 20:32.360
He mentioned the prize and
said he wouldn't be attending.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.892
I told him he'd miss
an opportunity to see you.

20:35.925 --> 20:37.952
I was on Long Island
six months ago.

20:38.025 --> 20:40.048
I spent a week with him and Rose.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.103
I know.

20:41.129 --> 20:43.283
I don't give a fuck
that you know.

20:44.137 --> 20:46.576
Henryk, you're almost on.

20:46.902 --> 20:49.132
- We should really go.
- Would you excuse me?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.825
Of course, it's time.

20:54.394 --> 20:57.381
We had an affair when
we were shooting Maloja Snake.

20:57.425 --> 20:58.795
Yeah, I couldn't tell.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.884
Well, I was 18 and kinda dumb.

21:00.982 --> 21:03.023
And he really took advantage.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.070
After the shoot,
I never heard from him.

21:06.204 --> 21:07.784
It destroyed me.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.964
I'm sure you've run into him since.

21:10.584 --> 21:13.218
We made another film
together afterwards.

21:14.184 --> 21:16.398
- Which one?
- Oh, you don't want to know.

21:16.458 --> 21:18.116
Tolstoy adaptation.

21:18.170 --> 21:19.648
German producers.

21:20.354 --> 21:21.728
Who cares?

21:22.112 --> 21:26.477
Well ten years later, I was famous.
Then he was interested.

21:26.648 --> 21:29.618
And he kept harassing me,
calling me in the middle of the night.

21:29.808 --> 21:32.837
I did not give in,
and that he hated.

21:32.979 --> 21:36.494
And he made me pay for it
every single day of the shooting.

21:37.227 --> 21:39.834
He was really amazing
in that one movie, um...

21:40.487 --> 21:41.918
What is it called?

21:42.525 --> 21:46.645
He plays a... Soviet defector
with, like, missile codes and shit?

21:46.725 --> 21:48.991
- Um... You know?
- No Idea. No, I don't know.

21:49.049 --> 21:50.735
Never heard of it.

21:51.385 --> 21:52.799
He's great in it.

21:53.701 --> 21:55.121
He's so intense.

21:55.155 --> 21:57.828
Especially, in the more physical scenes.
That stare...

21:57.898 --> 22:00.414
He is like, Ppp.
I like him.

22:00.455 --> 22:01.954
Yeah, I kind of got it.

22:02.124 --> 22:04.508
I mean, as an actor,
I really like him.

22:12.791 --> 22:17.041
<i>And unfortunately,
he has to leave tomorrow morning.</i>

22:17.148 --> 22:19.214
<i>Henryk Wald!</i>

22:23.411 --> 22:25.321
<i>Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

22:25.382 --> 22:28.747
Four years ago,
I was here on this stage...

22:29.121 --> 22:33.392
<i>for the premiere of the Reichstag,
by Wilhelm Melchior.</i>

22:35.080 --> 22:38.916
<i>I did not know then that
it would be his last work.</i>

22:39.370 --> 22:43.813
<i>He sat in the third row
and stared at me.</i>

22:45.020 --> 22:47.646
<i>I had never acted so badly.</i>

22:48.058 --> 22:50.701
Maria, you're on in five minutes.

22:52.887 --> 22:56.503
<i>Wilhelm Melchior
will always be with us,...</i>

22:56.657 --> 22:58.177
<i>through his works.</i>

22:58.722 --> 23:01.902
- Maria, you wait in there.
- I had the privilege to work for him...

23:01.942 --> 23:04.549
here in London and elsewhere.

23:04.668 --> 23:07.934
So, I don't say "goodbye", only...

23:08.087 --> 23:09.981
"see you soon", Wilhelm.

23:12.679 --> 23:16.839
Thank you, Henryk,
for the beautiful tribute.

23:16.922 --> 23:19.758
Let's now welcome
an old friend of Wilhelm,

23:19.795 --> 23:22.532
who came just for this occasion.

23:22.585 --> 23:24.858
Please, give your
heartfelt applause for...

23:24.930 --> 23:26.807
Maria Enders.

23:39.366 --> 23:40.644
Thank you.

23:43.582 --> 23:45.307
Go get them, tiger.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.524
Thank you very much.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.961
- Hi.
- Good evening. Welcome.

24:12.115 --> 24:14.062
I'm honored to welcome you here.

24:14.175 --> 24:17.022
I wish it had been under
happier circumstances.

24:17.375 --> 24:18.682
It's...

24:19.390 --> 24:22.336
It's great to celebrate his work,
especially today.

24:22.443 --> 24:26.159
I was eager that the city
of Zurich pay tribute to him.

24:26.383 --> 24:29.079
He was very grateful to you.
He told me so.

24:31.698 --> 24:32.764
Hey.

24:32.858 --> 24:34.190
She'll just be two seconds.

24:34.238 --> 24:37.218
I'm sure she's gonna be thrilled
to be relieved of officialdom.

24:37.582 --> 24:39.663
You know that
his last play was set in Zurich?

24:39.711 --> 24:41.009
Oh, yes.

24:41.283 --> 24:44.256
He paints an idle portrait
of our political class.

24:44.290 --> 24:45.416
That's an understatement.

24:45.449 --> 24:49.109
You should know.
Your character was evil.

24:49.395 --> 24:51.201
Klaus Diesterweg
is here to see you.

24:53.155 --> 24:55.183
Excuse.
I'm sorry.

24:57.819 --> 24:59.463
I already told him "no".

24:59.799 --> 25:01.402
He's here just to see you.

25:01.434 --> 25:03.468
The project doesn't
interest me, okay?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.914
He's a great director,
just hear him out.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.046
You don't have to do it.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.619
He's probably the best for generation.

25:08.649 --> 25:11.259
I know.
We saw the same production.

25:11.369 --> 25:14.023
I mean, if you'd like to go on chatting
with the Mayor and Henryk,

25:14.056 --> 25:15.623
then, be my guest.

25:17.471 --> 25:18.927
No, thank you.

25:22.941 --> 25:24.724
Hi, do you mind
if I cut out for a bit?

25:25.251 --> 25:27.764
- I'm just gonna go meet Berndt.
- Berndt?

25:27.844 --> 25:29.364
The photographer.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.610
I'm just gonna find
somewhere a bit livelier.

25:32.635 --> 25:34.316
- This place hasn't had some.
- Hmm.

25:34.363 --> 25:36.898
No problem.
I don't plan to hang around.

25:37.044 --> 25:38.487
Enjoy.

25:42.987 --> 25:44.534
Thank you for finding
some time for me.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.713
It's a pleasure to meet you.

25:45.747 --> 25:47.707
- I hope you don't find me too insistent.
- No, not at all.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.593
I've seen quite a few
of your productions.

25:49.627 --> 25:51.441
I... enjoy them.
And...

25:51.797 --> 25:54.940
I know we'll find an opportunity
to work together...

25:55.000 --> 25:56.333
in the future.

25:56.468 --> 25:58.133
Give me one more chance.

25:58.435 --> 25:59.767
Klaus...

26:03.034 --> 26:06.087
I played Sigrid
in Maloja Snake...

26:06.414 --> 26:08.074
when he was 18.

26:08.174 --> 26:10.394
For me,
it was more than a role. And...

26:11.444 --> 26:13.700
in some way,
I am still Sigrid.

26:13.748 --> 26:14.917
That's my point.

26:14.957 --> 26:16.373
Sigrid seduces Helena...

26:16.407 --> 26:18.708
And it has nothing to do with
being a lesbian, by the way.

26:18.733 --> 26:20.227
I've always been straight.

26:20.300 --> 26:21.827
That's not at all what I meant.

26:21.867 --> 26:25.090
Sigrid is free...
beyond everything, and...

26:25.123 --> 26:26.623
most of all,
she's destructive,

26:26.657 --> 26:28.583
- unpredictable...
- I know.

26:29.947 --> 26:33.487
And right or wrong,
I've always identified with that freedom.

26:34.442 --> 26:36.229
It's a way of uh...

26:37.636 --> 26:39.436
protecting myself.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.002
Do you smoke?

26:41.349 --> 26:42.933
Uh, no, no.

26:43.329 --> 26:44.942
I try not to.

26:47.593 --> 26:50.060
And for you,
Helena embodies the opposite?

26:50.122 --> 26:52.620
Helena's 40.
She runs a company.

26:52.788 --> 26:56.128
She falls, head over heels, in love
with a girl who doesn't love her.

26:56.604 --> 26:58.165
And woos to suicide.

26:58.264 --> 27:00.964
Yes, she's completely the opposite.

27:01.276 --> 27:05.474
But, what is it that attracts Helena
to Sigrid if they are so different?

27:05.601 --> 27:06.940
It's obvious.

27:07.733 --> 27:09.179
Her youth.

27:09.645 --> 27:11.973
Well, if you're telling me that
I'm Helena's age now,

27:12.013 --> 27:13.826
yeah, you're right.
It's true.

27:14.379 --> 27:16.635
But, that doesn't mean
I can play her.

27:16.684 --> 27:19.175
The way I see Helena
is totally different.

27:19.331 --> 27:23.154
Despite her Bourgeois life,
despite her responsibilities,

27:23.196 --> 27:25.661
she's not the epitome of order.

27:25.694 --> 27:27.954
And not at all,
the opposite of Sigrid.

27:28.034 --> 27:32.647
No, she is married, with children.
Her social life is a huge success,

27:32.730 --> 27:35.626
And she sacrifices it all.
Yeah, she's destructive.

27:35.673 --> 27:39.506
Sigrid reviles this hidden violence
in Helena.

27:39.546 --> 27:41.909
What a "hidden" or "tamed"?

27:44.189 --> 27:46.795
Time's gone by and
she can't accept it.

27:47.142 --> 27:48.862
Me, neither, I guess.

27:51.274 --> 27:53.036
There's no antagonism.

27:53.145 --> 27:56.104
It's the attraction of two women
with the same wound.

27:56.648 --> 27:59.534
Sigrid and Helena are one
and the same person.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.668
One and the same person.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.046
That's what the play is about.

28:05.687 --> 28:09.121
And because you were Sigrid,
only you can be Helena now.

28:09.274 --> 28:11.977
Hmm, how can you be so sure?

28:12.342 --> 28:15.305
You know as well as I do that
Wilhelm Melchior...

28:15.358 --> 28:17.305
had been working on
a sequel for years.

28:17.358 --> 28:18.541
Yes.

28:18.615 --> 28:21.515
But, it was about Sigrid
at 40 years old.

28:21.571 --> 28:25.328
No, it was about Sigrid,
20 years later became Helena.

28:29.254 --> 28:31.885
So, who's gonna play Sigrid?

28:32.751 --> 28:34.365
Jo-Ann Ellis.

28:36.179 --> 28:39.446
She did a super-hero movie
that just opened in the States.

28:39.707 --> 28:41.147
And besides that?

28:41.188 --> 28:43.184
Not much..
She has nineteen.

28:43.397 --> 28:46.750
She's a lot more interesting
than her interviews and profiles.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.727
She has a theatrical background.

28:48.789 --> 28:52.142
She doesn't want to be
swallowed-up by Hollywood.

28:52.931 --> 28:57.144
She admires you and she's willing
to pull out of her other commitments.

29:01.773 --> 29:05.057
Well now,
I've listened carefully.

29:06.736 --> 29:09.744
But to be honest, um...
the role scares me.

29:09.798 --> 29:11.444
Helena scares me.

29:11.494 --> 29:13.664
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

29:13.971 --> 29:16.733
I feel alone and vulnerable.

29:17.124 --> 29:19.694
Probably, too vulnerable to do this.

29:20.769 --> 29:23.489
If you refuse,
I understand; but,...

29:24.556 --> 29:26.886
it will be a missed opportunity.

29:27.465 --> 29:29.422
Especially, for Wilhelm.

29:31.524 --> 29:33.237
I should get going.

29:36.221 --> 29:37.474
Must be nice...

29:41.103 --> 29:44.086
Excuse me;
but, I won't be staying for dinner.

29:45.788 --> 29:47.539
Good evening, Maria.

29:48.018 --> 29:49.437
Klaus?

29:50.197 --> 29:51.984
I have another reason.

29:52.192 --> 29:53.801
Susan Rosenberg.

29:54.509 --> 29:56.522
She played Helena with me.

29:56.582 --> 29:58.722
I remember Susan Rosenberg.

29:59.136 --> 30:02.062
She died in a car accident
a year after.

30:03.588 --> 30:05.217
It's just a superstition,
I've um...

30:05.258 --> 30:08.631
always associated her death
with Helena's suicide.

30:08.677 --> 30:11.937
She was a lousy actress who didn't
understand a thing about the role,

30:14.191 --> 30:16.378
And her conventional style of acting

30:16.413 --> 30:19.438
highlighted the modernity
of your feal performance.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.536
You should be grateful to her.

30:31.504 --> 30:33.451
Please, sit down.

30:34.795 --> 30:36.235
Excuse me.

30:39.652 --> 30:42.835
Oh, is there a way of changing this?
Put him uh...

30:42.890 --> 30:45.462
I'm, I'm sorry.
Oh, he's coming.

30:56.436 --> 30:57.909
Thank you, sir.

31:01.380 --> 31:03.374
You were with Klaus Diesterweg.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.637
Are you going to accept his offer?

31:05.698 --> 31:06.840
What offer?

31:06.881 --> 31:07.974
You know.

31:08.043 --> 31:09.606
He's a very good director.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.293
If he offered me a role,
I'd accept it on the spot.

31:12.390 --> 31:15.359
So, that means, um...
I should accept it?

31:15.438 --> 31:17.078
God, no!

31:19.622 --> 31:23.068
There's much talk
about sequel of his.

31:24.075 --> 31:26.255
Remember, he had never finished it.

31:26.382 --> 31:27.889
Sorry for being brutal.

31:28.102 --> 31:29.615
But, I am a simple man...

31:29.729 --> 31:31.782
and the play tells a simple story.

31:32.030 --> 31:34.749
An older woman falls in love
with a scheming girl

31:34.775 --> 31:36.719
that has her wrapped
around her little finger.

31:37.042 --> 31:38.962
The girl takes advantage of her,...

31:39.029 --> 31:41.352
squeezes everything
she can out of her,...

31:41.498 --> 31:42.992
then dumps her.

31:43.078 --> 31:45.834
Helena's love for Sigrid
makes her stupid.

31:45.878 --> 31:49.187
And blind to what everybody in
the audience can see right away.

31:49.421 --> 31:52.851
But then, that's really all
she's ever wanted.

31:53.537 --> 31:56.657
She's fascinated by her own downfall.

31:56.804 --> 31:58.677
It's as clear as day.

31:59.111 --> 32:01.304
That's why the play was such a hit.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.657
It is still being performed today.

32:05.701 --> 32:07.741
Why stage it...

32:07.801 --> 32:11.707
- if you want to tell another story?
- I think your reading is simplistic.

32:12.502 --> 32:14.369
I know Sigrid, and...

32:15.196 --> 32:17.592
believe me, she's more
interesting than that.

32:17.652 --> 32:23.599
Yes, she takes advantage of Helena.
Yes, she fascinates her, and she knows it.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.315
Well, you can decide
not to look in further,

32:26.362 --> 32:28.712
but, I had to,
because I played her.

32:28.794 --> 32:31.405
You're just talking about
what's on the surface.

32:32.285 --> 32:35.515
The play's about what
attracts them to each other. Hence,...

32:35.608 --> 32:38.401
it's harder to see,
and it's more profound, and...

32:38.687 --> 32:39.788
truer.

32:40.858 --> 32:43.659
The impossibility of
their relationship is

32:43.693 --> 32:45.639
as cruel for Sigrid.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.739
Cruel for Sigrid?

32:48.118 --> 32:49.558
I'm sure she'll get over it.

32:49.584 --> 32:50.977
What do you know?

32:51.037 --> 32:52.731
Time.
Youth.

32:53.064 --> 32:54.925
She has her life ahead of her

32:54.975 --> 32:57.345
Well, Helena's young too,
I mean, she's not old.

32:57.387 --> 32:59.147
She has her life ahead of her too.

32:59.194 --> 33:00.781
But, she decides to give it all up.

33:00.815 --> 33:02.978
Helena is not used to
being turned down.

33:03.378 --> 33:07.171
She's discovered her own frailty
and she can't accept it.

33:20.753 --> 33:23.744
We'll drop Mr. Wald off first,
please.

33:25.015 --> 33:27.371
Grand Hôtel du Lac,
please.

33:31.306 --> 33:33.732
So, Klaus has persuaded you?

33:34.151 --> 33:35.970
You're going to play Helena.

33:37.445 --> 33:39.298
I didn't say that.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.712
But, I'm considering it.

33:42.223 --> 33:43.650
Yes.

33:56.598 --> 33:59.768
Are you sure you don't
want to have a last drink?

34:03.963 --> 34:07.156
I'm already drunk,...
darling.

34:11.985 --> 34:13.409
Henryk!

34:14.388 --> 34:15.788
Hold on.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.360
ROOM 339

34:53.014 --> 34:54.364
HENRYK WALD

35:24.470 --> 35:26.328
JO ANN ELLIS

35:40.770 --> 35:43.304
PART TWO

36:22.306 --> 36:23.594
Wow!

36:24.088 --> 36:25.481
Hey.

36:25.871 --> 36:27.898
I've just found the main road again.
I'm sorry.

36:27.938 --> 36:29.551
I must've set the GPS wrong.

36:29.598 --> 36:32.065
Like, in an hour or so, probably.

36:32.876 --> 36:34.134
I had a um...

36:34.556 --> 36:35.848
dream um...

36:37.910 --> 36:39.986
We were rehearsing,
and the...

36:40.026 --> 36:43.373
past and the present
were blending together.

36:44.297 --> 36:45.864
I'm confused.

36:46.124 --> 36:47.581
No kidding.

36:48.190 --> 36:50.753
I should not have said "yes" to Klaus.

36:51.246 --> 36:52.379
But,...

36:52.499 --> 36:55.569
Wilhelm's death mourning,
I couldn't refuse.

36:55.636 --> 36:57.636
He is a "sick" director.

36:58.349 --> 37:01.029
Jo-Ann is a super star.
It pays well.

37:01.780 --> 37:03.591
I don't need the money.

37:06.143 --> 37:07.316
Okay.

37:31.354 --> 37:32.634
Hi.

37:38.303 --> 37:40.257
Stay as long as you want.

37:40.553 --> 37:43.313
I like the fact
that you are walking

37:43.439 --> 37:46.099
in the part here
where it was written.

37:47.029 --> 37:50.082
You promised.
No ghosts.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.982
No, there aren't any.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.947
I was joking!

37:54.993 --> 37:58.239
No, it was half joking.

38:46.206 --> 38:48.899
This is what I wanted to show you.

38:49.015 --> 38:51.515
This is where Wilhelm killed himself.

38:51.695 --> 38:55.229
But, that... that stays...
between you and me.

38:59.981 --> 39:02.728
Is that the Maloja pass, over there?

39:02.774 --> 39:03.968
Yeah.

39:04.064 --> 39:06.344
- The Snake, right?
- The Snake.

39:06.391 --> 39:09.064
- Why a "snake" in the play? It's uh...
- Yeah.

39:09.471 --> 39:11.244
It's ambiguous.

39:11.889 --> 39:13.765
The Maloja snake.

39:14.419 --> 39:17.273
It's a cloud formation.

39:17.385 --> 39:19.322
Fairly rare.

39:19.396 --> 39:21.309
Virtually unexplained.

39:21.396 --> 39:24.496
It's a sign...
of bad weather.

39:25.404 --> 39:28.594
And the clouds,
they are coming from the Italian lakes,...

39:28.757 --> 39:30.400
over the pass,...

39:30.567 --> 39:33.534
and winding through the Valley...

39:34.024 --> 39:35.970
like a serpent.

39:36.895 --> 39:40.071
Therefore, it's a snake.
They call it a snake.

39:40.207 --> 39:43.589
THE CLOUD PHENOMENON OF MALOJA

39:50.695 --> 39:53.488
FORESHADOWINGS

40:00.437 --> 40:03.954
THE CLOUDS RISE OVER THE PASS OF MALOJA

40:13.317 --> 40:15.761
THE SO-CALLED MALOJA SNAKE

40:26.081 --> 40:28.811
Wilhelm was fascinated
by this film.

40:29.163 --> 40:33.937
He used to marvel at the fact that
the true nature of the landscape...

40:33.990 --> 40:37.563
revealed itself in these images.

40:39.245 --> 40:40.685
Yeah, um...

40:41.045 --> 40:44.118
But, the black and white
creates a distance,

40:44.298 --> 40:47.040
It sets the passing of time.

40:47.540 --> 40:50.667
It's almost a century old.

40:50.907 --> 40:54.843
Actually, it
comes from very far away.

40:55.095 --> 40:57.273
That's the beauty of it.

41:12.235 --> 41:14.376
- Thank you so much!
- Nice to meet you. Thank you.

41:14.422 --> 41:16.114
Thank you.

41:19.080 --> 41:22.654
I won't promise to come and
see you off in London.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.087
I hope you change your mind,
all right?

41:26.957 --> 41:29.316
It is only theater.

41:32.572 --> 41:33.948
Oh, Maria!

41:35.426 --> 41:37.866
This belonged to Wilhelm.

41:38.573 --> 41:40.126
Keep it.

41:59.639 --> 42:02.106
Well, you were 18 years old.
You weren't a child.

42:02.261 --> 42:05.379
There had to have been
some kind of attraction in her.

42:06.537 --> 42:08.854
Wilhelm was far from a saint, right?

42:11.181 --> 42:12.889
- No.
- Maybe.

42:15.587 --> 42:17.074
Hmm!

42:17.254 --> 42:21.084
He did choose me; so,
he must have felt something, but...

42:21.303 --> 42:23.434
that remains unspoken.

42:24.617 --> 42:27.026
- So you admit...
- And it's not very important.

42:27.966 --> 42:30.126
- It's not very important.
- Uh.

42:30.457 --> 42:33.691
If that's not important,
what the fuck is important?

42:33.768 --> 42:36.667
All that matters is
what's in the movie.

42:37.293 --> 42:39.213
So you admit
there was attraction?

42:40.101 --> 42:41.263
Stop.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.967
Why?
Was it mutual?

42:45.034 --> 42:46.201
Yes!

42:46.919 --> 42:49.022
No! I do not know.
I do not know.

42:49.628 --> 42:51.848
You don't understand.

42:54.732 --> 42:57.572
Yes, I was attracted
to Wilhelm. But,...

42:57.612 --> 42:58.852
it's normal.

42:58.905 --> 43:02.452
I was fine with just
feeling attracted, instead...

43:02.693 --> 43:04.613
with the intimacy.

43:05.354 --> 43:07.461
So, there was intimacy too?

43:11.595 --> 43:14.248
Stop picking apart
every word I say!

43:14.295 --> 43:17.265
Anything more would have
endangered our relationship.

43:17.732 --> 43:19.072
I was...

43:19.609 --> 43:24.618
My intuition told me that was
far more valuable than desired.

43:25.322 --> 43:26.760
I... I feel you.

43:26.969 --> 43:28.475
You were in love with him.

43:28.615 --> 43:30.575
Of course I wasn't.

43:30.952 --> 43:32.612
Stop over-simplifying.

43:32.665 --> 43:34.872
It's too easy.
I was less than that.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.092
And I was better.

43:38.675 --> 43:39.782
I don't know any more.

43:39.816 --> 43:42.475
Maybe I only remember
what suits me to remember.

43:42.782 --> 43:44.682
Yeah, I think so.

43:44.789 --> 43:47.155
- The story changes every time.
- Bitch!

43:49.071 --> 43:51.818
Do you want to christen
a shopping mall in Nanking?

43:51.931 --> 43:53.025
No

43:53.668 --> 43:55.895
How about the series of
commercials for eye glasses?

43:55.928 --> 43:56.928
No

43:56.968 --> 43:58.281
It's only in Latin America.

43:58.321 --> 43:59.455
No!

43:59.508 --> 44:00.782
All right, um...

44:01.047 --> 44:02.969
There's a Spanish horror flick.
It's pretty gory,

44:02.994 --> 44:04.914
You'd be playing a Mother Superior.

44:05.032 --> 44:08.021
There are werewolves involved,
for whatever reason.

44:08.086 --> 44:09.094
No

44:09.191 --> 44:11.337
An interview with Italian magazine

44:11.379 --> 44:14.365
targeting active women
seduction after 40.

44:15.729 --> 44:16.845
No!

44:17.574 --> 44:18.861
But it's the cover...

44:18.933 --> 44:19.967
No!

44:20.721 --> 44:22.430
Mario Testino's shooting it.

44:22.464 --> 44:23.607
I don't care.

44:25.146 --> 44:27.360
Jo-Ann Ellis' movie is
opening up in Europe.

44:27.453 --> 44:28.860
She wants to meet you.

44:29.133 --> 44:30.180
When?

44:30.289 --> 44:31.526
Next week.

44:32.846 --> 44:34.069
Where?

44:35.034 --> 44:36.249
Wherever you want.

44:36.319 --> 44:38.069
She'll come here if you like.

44:39.203 --> 44:40.916
Definately not here.

44:41.094 --> 44:43.274
Maybe, I'll tell her
to book the Waldhaus.

44:44.697 --> 44:46.077
When's the movie opening?

44:46.171 --> 44:47.677
It opened last week.

44:47.970 --> 44:49.830
Have you read a paper lately?

44:50.179 --> 44:51.846
I'm sorry.
You want one?

44:53.671 --> 44:55.971
It's playing in St. Moritz
if you wanna see it.

44:56.258 --> 44:59.358
Uh, I'd rather wait
until rehearsals started.

45:00.106 --> 45:02.232
Keep the image of Sigrid
as myself at 18.

45:02.281 --> 45:05.086
I-I-I know, I know.
It's a little disturbing.

45:05.666 --> 45:07.792
But, I find it more interesting.

45:07.836 --> 45:10.796
Well, I didn't know you at 18.
But,...

45:10.939 --> 45:12.956
I'm almost positive
Jo-Ann's a lot worse.

45:13.030 --> 45:14.468
How can you be so sure?

45:15.091 --> 45:16.761
Have you Goggled her?

45:16.858 --> 45:19.178
Well, I just looked at the pictures.

45:19.984 --> 45:23.084
Well, you should dig a little deeper.

45:24.195 --> 45:26.992
Won't take you long to find
all the naked photos.

45:27.272 --> 45:29.785
The latest updates of her exploits.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.085
Such as?

45:31.298 --> 45:33.226
Her breakup?

45:33.887 --> 45:35.766
Andrew Beltram?

45:36.747 --> 45:38.466
Any idea who that is?

45:38.653 --> 45:40.153
I don't know.

45:40.474 --> 45:42.959
What world do you live in?

45:42.990 --> 45:45.635
He's like...
He's the biggest star.

45:45.696 --> 45:46.923
Says who?

45:47.183 --> 45:49.024
- Pre-teens.
- Oh.

45:49.179 --> 45:52.423
Hey, there are a shit ton of them.
So, be careful.

45:52.957 --> 45:56.780
Um, he broke up with her because
she wouldn't stop getting wasted.

45:56.828 --> 45:58.293
Cheating on him in public.

45:58.353 --> 46:00.047
So, she went to
his house with a gun,

46:00.093 --> 46:02.174
and he went bat-shit.
Threw her out.

46:02.209 --> 46:04.962
But, like, violently threw her out.

46:05.026 --> 46:07.464
Not exactly the way
Klaus described her.

46:07.704 --> 46:09.204
The neighbors had to subdue her.

46:09.238 --> 46:10.707
She was, like,
shooting up the place.

46:10.749 --> 46:12.307
Apparently, it wasn't easy.

46:12.588 --> 46:14.868
She went to rehab
to get out of doing time.

46:15.028 --> 46:16.061
She's better now.

46:16.104 --> 46:18.414
According to the press releases.

46:18.466 --> 46:19.681
Well, yeah.

46:20.139 --> 46:23.032
And the...
the classical training,

46:23.066 --> 46:25.432
the theater background,
is that all...

46:25.532 --> 46:27.914
- bullshit?
- No, no, that's all true.

46:28.028 --> 46:30.654
She took off and just
started really fucking up.

46:30.741 --> 46:33.371
Um,... I think she probably
got jealous of, like,...

46:33.431 --> 46:35.658
Hollywood... trash.

46:36.836 --> 46:38.610
TMZ deemed her "The...

46:38.656 --> 46:42.290
A-List actress that
dreamt of making it to the Z-List."

46:42.340 --> 46:44.557
You could have told me sooner.

46:46.339 --> 46:48.629
You despise internet gossip.

46:48.667 --> 46:51.422
This is not gossip.
It's information.

46:51.735 --> 46:53.555
It's celebrity news.

46:53.862 --> 46:54.888
It's fun.

46:54.932 --> 46:57.381
- I thought you liked her a lot.
- I do.

46:57.548 --> 46:59.635
I love her.
She's not...

46:59.688 --> 47:02.341
completely antiseptic
like the rest of Hollywood.

47:02.416 --> 47:06.139
Well, you just said she was
a self-destructive, crazy girl.

47:06.305 --> 47:07.365
I didn't say that.

47:07.428 --> 47:09.332
Sorry, I must have
misunderstood then.

47:09.398 --> 47:10.954
Where are my fucking cigarettes?

47:11.048 --> 47:12.794
They're right in front of you.

47:13.081 --> 47:14.347
Where?!

47:16.356 --> 47:18.271
- Hello!
- Ah!

47:20.153 --> 47:22.038
She's brave enough
to be herself.

47:22.519 --> 47:24.805
At her age, I think
that's pretty fucking cool.

47:27.354 --> 47:29.702
I don't see what's so cool
about fucking around,

47:29.742 --> 47:31.229
getting wasted out of your mind,

47:31.262 --> 47:33.356
and almost killing your boyfriend
who's sick of you.

47:33.411 --> 47:35.301
I think she's got a bright future.

47:35.928 --> 47:38.368
Actually, I think she's probably
my favorite actress.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.774
Hmm.

47:41.373 --> 47:43.833
You mean more than me, huh?

47:45.057 --> 47:46.284
No, I...

47:46.731 --> 47:49.117
- I didn't mean that.
- Huh?

47:49.886 --> 47:51.240
I'm more...

47:51.360 --> 47:53.400
What?
Conventional?

47:54.338 --> 47:55.866
Boring?

47:56.729 --> 47:59.136
And I can't reach her intensity?

47:59.183 --> 48:00.603
No.

48:00.923 --> 48:02.223
I didn't say that.

48:02.514 --> 48:03.937
Of course not.

48:06.379 --> 48:07.930
Good night.

48:15.157 --> 48:16.504
Hey!

48:16.805 --> 48:18.464
Motherfucker!

48:18.613 --> 48:21.846
Hey, stop fucking following me
around or I'll fucking kill you!

48:21.900 --> 48:23.582
I'll fucking kill you!

48:28.975 --> 48:31.302
So, let me ask you a tough question.

48:31.368 --> 48:33.862
You were fired from the
"Forbidden Planet" remake.

48:33.898 --> 48:35.675
I don't know about that.

48:35.827 --> 48:40.323
You were supposed to play
the old Anne Francis' role, AltÃ©a?

48:40.423 --> 48:41.883
I don't know, maybe.

48:41.928 --> 48:46.302
After your DUI arrest,
your studio canceled the contract.

48:46.368 --> 48:48.482
You know, even if that were true,

48:48.582 --> 48:52.682
that would have cost them
an arm and a leg.

48:53.427 --> 48:56.580
What if it were true, which I'm
I'm not saying it is.

48:56.668 --> 48:59.360
But hypothetically speaking,
I wouldn't...

48:59.501 --> 49:02.261
be able to even talk about it right now,
because I would have signed

49:02.301 --> 49:04.621
a confidentiality agreement
with the studio.

49:04.658 --> 49:05.658
Sure.

49:05.704 --> 49:08.865
So, let's imagine...
you were arrested for DUI.

49:08.899 --> 49:11.492
And you had insulted
the police officers.

49:11.556 --> 49:12.602
No, no, no, no.

49:12.656 --> 49:14.669
That's not hypothetical.
That's a verified fact.

49:14.749 --> 49:17.008
I did get arrested on DUI,

49:17.048 --> 49:19.183
and I... I... I did assault
police officers.

49:19.254 --> 49:21.571
So, it's the studio's reaction
that's hypothetical?

49:21.655 --> 49:22.944
Exactly!

49:22.984 --> 49:26.167
And their hypothetical
batch of crazy response,

49:26.240 --> 49:29.334
would have cost them
a hypothetical seven-figure sum,

49:29.379 --> 49:32.342
which I guess I wouldn't be able
to talk about right now, right?

49:32.895 --> 49:36.109
So, will you be appearing on
the remake for "Forbidden Planet?

49:36.169 --> 49:37.402
Ah...

49:37.603 --> 49:39.409
I would rather die...

49:39.596 --> 49:41.490
very, very slowly...

49:41.549 --> 49:43.736
of, probably, food poisoning.

50:06.934 --> 50:09.417
Rumor has it that
we'll see you on stage?

50:10.230 --> 50:11.890
Yeah, um...

50:11.990 --> 50:15.599
I'm admitted... I'm gonna do...
do a play called "Maloja's Snake".

50:15.688 --> 50:17.738
Uh, with Maria Enders.

50:18.991 --> 50:21.724
Um, she's gonna play the older woman,

50:21.775 --> 50:26.006
and I will play the one
who drives her to suicide.

50:26.749 --> 50:28.589
France is kinda rad, eh?

50:28.632 --> 50:30.399
Where in London will it play?

50:30.691 --> 50:34.012
They told me the name of it...
this theatre.

50:35.427 --> 50:37.401
It's still being negotiated.

50:37.446 --> 50:38.807
Who's directing?

50:39.181 --> 50:40.287
Klaus.

50:40.434 --> 50:41.823
Klaus who?

50:41.957 --> 50:45.437
Klaus, Klaus.
Like, you know, "THE" Klaus.

50:45.552 --> 50:46.888
Klaus Klaus?

50:46.977 --> 50:48.559
Klaus Klaus.

50:48.662 --> 50:50.038
Yeah, fucking Klaus.

50:50.071 --> 50:53.278
You should do your job and look him up.
You're a fucking reporter for God's sake.

50:53.305 --> 50:54.806
Well, you apparently don't know him.

50:54.865 --> 50:56.098
Santa "Klaus"!

50:58.355 --> 51:00.000
Klaus Kinski!

51:00.083 --> 51:01.552
Klaus Barbie!

51:21.422 --> 51:22.475
Hey.

51:22.555 --> 51:24.330
This is the armchair.

51:25.698 --> 51:27.059
Um...

51:29.310 --> 51:31.067
Office door.

51:33.406 --> 51:34.673
Desk.

51:36.604 --> 51:38.137
Okay, go ahead.

51:44.638 --> 51:46.003
Come in.

51:50.027 --> 51:53.582
Sigrid, I asked you here because
your internship is almost over.

51:54.689 --> 51:57.049
And I want to congratulate you.

51:57.812 --> 51:59.159
Personally.

51:59.426 --> 52:00.779
Have a seat.

52:04.106 --> 52:06.326
No, there.
In the armchair.

52:16.810 --> 52:19.492
Everyone in my office sings your praises.

52:20.882 --> 52:23.031
Including the nastiest ones.

52:23.731 --> 52:26.258
The ones who think that I shouldn't
have taken over the company

52:26.291 --> 52:27.817
after my father died.

52:28.841 --> 52:31.587
That I'm running it into the ground.

52:32.905 --> 52:34.485
The ones who consider me incompetent,

52:34.519 --> 52:37.899
not because I am a woman,
but because they look at the figures,

52:38.479 --> 52:41.713
and the figures...
aren't what they should be.

52:43.338 --> 52:46.405
I know it's true.
It keeps me up at night.

52:49.673 --> 52:51.987
It's been eating away at me.

52:53.087 --> 52:55.627
They persuaded me and
I think they're right.

52:55.707 --> 52:57.227
Why are you telling me this?

52:57.327 --> 52:58.750
It's none of my business.

52:58.888 --> 53:00.750
You want people to know?

53:03.065 --> 53:06.494
You think if you arouse their pity,
they'll back off.

53:08.468 --> 53:10.437
I've been around a lot less than you.

53:10.912 --> 53:13.911
Then, my experience is quite the opposite,
wouldn't you agree?

53:14.953 --> 53:17.344
When they tell me about you,

53:17.925 --> 53:20.110
how much they appreciate you,

53:20.674 --> 53:23.518
they're using you to humiliate me.

53:23.558 --> 53:26.308
Shit! I messed up!
Fuck!

53:26.971 --> 53:28.391
It's... what?

53:28.457 --> 53:29.477
To remind.

53:29.524 --> 53:31.604
It's to remind me!
Aw!

53:31.671 --> 53:32.937
Shit!

53:37.351 --> 53:39.731
I hate this fucking scene.

53:41.059 --> 53:44.444
Ah, I have too many memories
of Susan Rosenberg

53:44.491 --> 53:48.461
and the disgust she made me feel
when she was slipping into the skin of this

53:48.520 --> 53:50.271
defeated woman.

53:50.307 --> 53:52.549
She got such obscene
pleasure out of it,

53:52.583 --> 53:53.816
night after night!

53:53.976 --> 53:55.116
Why-why "defeated"?

53:55.153 --> 53:57.090
Defeated by... by...

53:57.406 --> 54:01.082
Age, by... by... her insecurity.

54:02.753 --> 54:05.439
Letting this kid lead her
around by the nose.

54:05.480 --> 54:08.546
But, that's not all there is to it.
There's...

54:08.578 --> 54:10.366
Let's start over.

54:11.367 --> 54:15.453
This poor woman is ready to kill herself
before the play even starts.

54:16.187 --> 54:19.096
She's using Sigrid as a weapon.
That's all.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.031
Let's start over.

54:27.727 --> 54:30.249
When they tell me about you,

54:30.980 --> 54:33.489
how much they appreciate you,

54:35.239 --> 54:37.126
is to remind me

54:37.193 --> 54:40.920
how happy they are to grant you
what they never granted me.

54:42.468 --> 54:45.279
They're using to humiliate me.

54:46.032 --> 54:50.304
It's not just your youth,
or your powers of seduction.

54:51.063 --> 54:52.563
No, it's your aplomb,

54:52.629 --> 54:54.870
your unshakeable self-conscience.

54:54.923 --> 54:56.129
You don't know me.

54:56.169 --> 54:58.454
Nothing gets you.
You radiate...

54:58.784 --> 55:00.304
self-confidence.

55:00.537 --> 55:01.945
And you don't?

55:02.015 --> 55:03.725
I wear a mask.

55:03.978 --> 55:07.821
It works with some people,
others see right through it.

55:09.667 --> 55:11.999
I can tell which is which right away.

55:12.072 --> 55:14.220
There's one thing I excel at,

55:14.390 --> 55:16.317
that's reading people's behavior.

55:16.363 --> 55:18.532
And how should I be reading yours?

55:22.166 --> 55:23.740
How do you think?

55:26.610 --> 55:29.786
I don't know, I'm reluctant to say it.
But, that's pretty clear.

55:29.834 --> 55:31.333
Tell me reluctant.

55:32.350 --> 55:35.137
Helena crosses and uncrosses her legs,

55:35.203 --> 55:37.037
reaches for a cigarette.

55:39.251 --> 55:41.433
You talk about your insecurities,

55:41.838 --> 55:43.737
your vulnerabilities.

55:44.598 --> 55:46.264
You opened up to me.

55:46.338 --> 55:48.218
I'm not exactly sure why.

55:50.124 --> 55:51.998
It's as if you're expecting something.

55:52.075 --> 55:53.464
Can I be frank?

55:58.035 --> 56:00.975
I don't think it's company figures
that are keeping you up at night.

56:01.028 --> 56:02.575
What's keeping me up then?

56:02.618 --> 56:04.021
Desire.

56:05.470 --> 56:07.261
For me, I think.

56:07.514 --> 56:10.121
I noticed it the second you hired me,
and I'm sorry,

56:10.166 --> 56:11.968
but I've had fun playing with it.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.836
You've let me play with it.

56:14.883 --> 56:16.656
Fun?

56:17.109 --> 56:19.083
What a strange word!

56:19.831 --> 56:21.494
Not what I was expecting.

56:21.543 --> 56:23.694
Ah, this text is impossible!

56:23.860 --> 56:25.087
Oh, my God!

56:25.467 --> 56:26.980
So now the play is bad?

56:27.033 --> 56:30.570
No, but everything's waited
to make Sigrid look good.

56:32.677 --> 56:34.337
I didn't mean it like that.

56:35.311 --> 56:38.037
I see her arrogance,
her cruelty...

56:38.086 --> 56:39.603
and Helena's humanity.

56:40.505 --> 56:42.522
She's able to talk about her own pain.

56:42.755 --> 56:44.108
It's moving.

56:44.375 --> 56:46.162
Let's start over.

56:49.323 --> 56:50.825
Fun?

56:51.942 --> 56:53.698
What a strange word!

56:55.562 --> 56:58.135
Not what I was expecting.

56:58.418 --> 57:01.051
- She's such a stupid cunt.
- Oh.

57:01.391 --> 57:04.558
And I didn't expect you
to talk about desire, either.

57:05.306 --> 57:07.106
Let me be frank, now.

57:07.404 --> 57:09.254
It makes me uncomfortable.

57:10.078 --> 57:12.311
And it forces me to see you...

57:12.593 --> 57:13.793
differently

57:13.946 --> 57:15.931
And that gets under your skin.

57:17.015 --> 57:18.688
Pause.

57:19.255 --> 57:20.622
You can tell me.

57:20.855 --> 57:22.155
Stands,

57:22.289 --> 57:24.089
lights a cigarette.

57:24.992 --> 57:27.524
In fact, it's exactly what
you want to say, so say it.

57:27.557 --> 57:28.955
Yes, it's true.

57:29.577 --> 57:31.552
You get under my skin.

57:33.066 --> 57:35.682
And I wanted to ask you
to stay on, and...

57:35.904 --> 57:37.796
become my personal assistant.

57:39.161 --> 57:42.014
She doesn't accept...
I mean, she does accept.

57:42.614 --> 57:45.227
Without hesitation, she accepts!

58:04.881 --> 58:08.154
Urg, I've been
feeling sick all morning.

58:13.014 --> 58:14.521
I feel dirty.

58:16.121 --> 58:17.341
I don't like Helena,

58:17.381 --> 58:20.034
no matter how much
humanity you see in her.

58:20.762 --> 58:22.908
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

58:25.888 --> 58:27.337
Or maybe because that humanity,

58:27.364 --> 58:29.684
I don't know, I don't care.
I don't feel good in her skin.

58:29.731 --> 58:31.971
I don't know why I have
to inflict this on myself.

58:32.022 --> 58:33.238
Then don't do it.

58:33.926 --> 58:36.990
That's what I'm saying.
I'm not doing it.

59:07.730 --> 59:09.849
I'd like to take the car tonight.

59:10.632 --> 59:13.298
Berndt rented a house on Lake Como
with some friends.

59:13.428 --> 59:14.918
That's pretty far.

59:15.943 --> 59:17.210
It's...

59:17.873 --> 59:19.730
two hours by car.

59:20.674 --> 59:23.277
If I left at six, I could
probably be back by sunrise.

59:25.801 --> 59:27.361
You'll be okay alone?

59:27.491 --> 59:28.654
Yeah.

59:28.739 --> 59:31.895
No, just... just be careful
on the mountain roads at night.

59:34.813 --> 59:36.682
Are you involved with him?

59:37.749 --> 59:40.602
I mean, is...
is there a thing now?

59:42.657 --> 59:44.096
I like him.

59:44.436 --> 59:46.409
Ah, you like him.

59:47.658 --> 59:49.329
That's all we'll get.

59:51.872 --> 59:53.272
You're jealous.

59:54.656 --> 59:55.845
Jealousy?

59:57.295 --> 59:58.502
I don't know.

59:58.723 --> 01:00:00.020
My time.

01:00:00.876 --> 01:00:02.068
My thoughts.

01:00:03.395 --> 01:00:04.721
Maybe, my affection.

01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:06.832
No, I'm not jealous.

01:00:06.905 --> 01:00:08.961
I'm thrilled that
you have a boyfriend.

01:00:09.185 --> 01:00:10.868
There haven't been that many.

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:14.658
And when there is one,
you burn through him pretty fast.

01:00:16.024 --> 01:00:18.377
- I'll tell you.
- No, you won't.

01:00:18.793 --> 01:00:22.706
And I never know if I should believe
what little you do tell me.

01:00:23.362 --> 01:00:24.779
It's you.

01:00:30.575 --> 01:00:33.120
Why the fuck are we doing this?

01:01:01.982 --> 01:01:04.203
Can you pass me those?
I'm a little late.

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:08.583
Sorry.

01:01:08.667 --> 01:01:09.917
See you.

01:02:32.727 --> 01:02:35.707
We can do anything.
But, you did sign a contract.

01:02:35.747 --> 01:02:37.012
Pulling out will cost you.

01:02:37.052 --> 01:02:38.957
You know,
I thought it over,

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.110
I worked on the scene,
I can't.

01:02:41.159 --> 01:02:42.913
I mean, I can, but...

01:02:43.122 --> 01:02:44.282
It... it's too hard.

01:02:44.331 --> 01:02:46.229
I feel too much resent for Helena.

01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:47.433
I am Sigrid!

01:02:47.499 --> 01:02:49.190
I want to stay Sigrid!

01:02:49.244 --> 01:02:51.340
Sigrid is twenty!

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.782
I don't care,
I know I'm right.

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:56.665
It doesn't interest me anymore.

01:02:56.705 --> 01:02:59.284
It spoils my memories!
It's not constructive!

01:02:59.331 --> 01:03:02.932
They'll sue and it'll go on
for months and months.

01:03:04.695 --> 01:03:06.229
They can replace me.

01:03:06.346 --> 01:03:07.422
It's too late.

01:03:07.482 --> 01:03:09.782
Klaus doesn't want
anyone else for Helena.

01:03:09.848 --> 01:03:11.291
So, I'm a hostage!

01:03:11.395 --> 01:03:13.971
You'll be appearing in
a prestigious production

01:03:14.004 --> 01:03:16.578
that's been waiting for
you for twenty years.

01:03:16.678 --> 01:03:19.081
I'm asking you
to get me out of this.

01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:22.201
Great! But, like I said,
it won't be cheap.

01:03:22.248 --> 01:03:23.994
Figure something out!

01:03:24.087 --> 01:03:26.043
There's no use getting upset.

01:03:26.123 --> 01:03:27.717
We'll take care of it.

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:30.570
But, I'm giving you
due diligence, okay?

01:06:05.164 --> 01:06:07.450
Wait!
You have to stay with us.

01:06:07.577 --> 01:06:09.750
We're mutants.
Just like you.

01:06:09.837 --> 01:06:11.464
But, we all have doubts.

01:06:11.595 --> 01:06:13.311
Doubt about our powers.

01:06:13.424 --> 01:06:14.898
Are we worthy of them?

01:06:14.991 --> 01:06:16.811
Do we have the right to use them?

01:06:16.911 --> 01:06:18.687
After all,...

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.260
what is good?

01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:21.974
And what is evil?

01:06:22.619 --> 01:06:24.998
And who are we to decide?

01:06:26.064 --> 01:06:29.117
Scarlett Witch and
Dr. Pretorius both agree.

01:06:30.037 --> 01:06:32.230
What you did was not treasonous.

01:06:32.377 --> 01:06:33.724
Forgive yourself.

01:06:34.159 --> 01:06:36.879
Don't judge your own actions so harshly.

01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:39.491
Uyh!

01:06:41.086 --> 01:06:43.370
Don't you understand?

01:06:43.823 --> 01:06:45.370
This is no mistake.

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:49.400
I have been double-crossing
the Alliance for a very long time now.

01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:52.747
And reporting directly
to Sargon.

01:06:52.835 --> 01:06:54.213
And you know why?

01:06:56.171 --> 01:06:59.798
Because I am madly in love with him.

01:07:00.415 --> 01:07:02.942
Do you remember when
he attacked our Dohl's outpost?

01:07:03.035 --> 01:07:05.955
I tried to fight him then,
but, I was alone and I failed.

01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:07.448
You weren't there.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.747
Neither was Doctor Pretorius,
and neither was Scarlett Witch.

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.153
He led me into a gravitational field
that neutralized my powers.

01:07:14.233 --> 01:07:15.573
He bolted me.

01:07:15.686 --> 01:07:17.053
We tried to find you.

01:07:17.121 --> 01:07:18.633
I woke up alone!

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.874
A prisoner in his fortress.

01:07:21.952 --> 01:07:23.606
And I know that he raped you.

01:07:24.096 --> 01:07:25.116
Yes

01:07:25.187 --> 01:07:26.989
He didn't rape me.

01:07:28.423 --> 01:07:30.165
I fell in love with him.

01:07:30.211 --> 01:07:31.794
I refuse to believe.

01:07:31.843 --> 01:07:35.220
Sargon is not a mutant.
But, he understands mutants' desires.

01:07:35.281 --> 01:07:37.734
I became his lover.
It's the only reason he set me free.

01:07:37.773 --> 01:07:39.189
You are crazy.

01:07:39.383 --> 01:07:41.042
Sargon loves no-one.

01:07:41.122 --> 01:07:43.883
He used me and then
he cast me aside.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:47.170
But maybe if I obey him,
maybe if I follow his orders,...

01:07:48.537 --> 01:07:50.727
he might just take me back.

01:08:19.697 --> 01:08:21.777
And place your bets, please.

01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:28.335
The last bet, thank you.
No more bets.

01:08:28.381 --> 01:08:29.582
Feeling lucky.

01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:33.045
28, black.

01:08:42.376 --> 01:08:44.376
Place your bets, please.

01:08:51.366 --> 01:08:52.898
9, red.

01:08:55.962 --> 01:08:58.238
Last bets, please.
That's it.

01:08:58.294 --> 01:08:59.569
Why, I stayed because of you.

01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:03.203
But, I could feel my brain
cells dying one by one.

01:09:03.298 --> 01:09:05.443
Okay, but you don't
find her amazing?

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.921
I think she's totally fascinating.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.252
It's such a stupid character, c'mon.

01:09:10.287 --> 01:09:12.569
Because it takes place on a spaceship?

01:09:13.742 --> 01:09:16.023
I know, that if it was set
on an assembly line

01:09:16.067 --> 01:09:17.910
or like a farm or something,
you'd love it.

01:09:17.937 --> 01:09:18.943
That's true.

01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:23.133
I have a hard time taking bimbos
in astronaut suits and Maliots and...

01:09:23.571 --> 01:09:25.805
generic pop psychology seriously.

01:09:25.845 --> 01:09:27.281
Been there and done that.

01:09:27.568 --> 01:09:28.591
I like it.

01:09:28.629 --> 01:09:32.037
I know... I know you do.
I'm sorry.

01:09:32.953 --> 01:09:34.831
There's no less truth...

01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:37.305
than in a more
supposedly serious film.

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:40.520
She goes deep into
the darker side of her character.

01:09:41.371 --> 01:09:43.661
It's daring.
It's really daring.

01:09:43.894 --> 01:09:46.625
In a... in a big movie like that,
it's fucking cool.

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:48.758
Well, she's got a great presence.

01:09:48.825 --> 01:09:51.957
But, I don't see
what's so daring about it.

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:55.826
Despite her superpowers?

01:09:58.259 --> 01:09:59.920
Her superpowers?

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:02.287
- Yes, her superpowers.
- Her superpowers?

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.742
Yes, her superpowers.

01:10:03.795 --> 01:10:07.282
So what if it's a convention? But, it's no
dumber than any other convention.

01:10:07.615 --> 01:10:10.905
Despite her superpowers,
she's emotionally defenseless.

01:10:11.132 --> 01:10:13.015
She's in love,
but she's not loved in return.

01:10:13.059 --> 01:10:15.655
This impossible love for Sargon,
the Alliance's worst enemy,

01:10:15.688 --> 01:10:17.328
leads her to betrayal and manic...

01:10:17.389 --> 01:10:18.409
Fucking shit!

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:21.178
Are you telling me there's nothing there,
worth playing there?

01:10:21.245 --> 01:10:23.945
I don't know, I don't know, Val.
I don't know.

01:10:27.447 --> 01:10:29.337
She knows that it means her downfall.

01:10:29.383 --> 01:10:31.895
But, that is the ultimate
truth of her desire.

01:10:31.948 --> 01:10:33.790
It's fucking powerful.

01:10:35.639 --> 01:10:39.235
Oh, my God!
I hate you sometimes so much!

01:10:39.289 --> 01:10:41.816
You're making my head spin.

01:10:42.575 --> 01:10:47.522
And Sargon,
you find him interesting, too?

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:50.710
Yeah, I do.

01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:52.216
Oh!
Good!

01:10:55.609 --> 01:10:57.463
No, Sargon sucks.

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:01.509
Jesus Christ!

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.200
All of it?

01:11:18.161 --> 01:11:19.441
Did you see that?

01:11:19.587 --> 01:11:21.827
My magical door opening power?

01:11:21.896 --> 01:11:23.329
My door...

01:11:23.969 --> 01:11:25.809
Sure you can drive?

01:11:26.247 --> 01:11:27.892
I had the same drinks as you.

01:11:27.952 --> 01:11:29.614
That's my point.

01:11:36.658 --> 01:11:38.419
Go, go, go, go.

01:11:56.949 --> 01:11:58.126
So...

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.028
what you were saying earlier,
what's that...

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:03.182
unlike Jo-Ann,

01:12:03.256 --> 01:12:05.576
I don't take that kind
of role seriously.

01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:06.750
Huh?

01:12:06.918 --> 01:12:08.879
What?
No.

01:12:08.959 --> 01:12:11.521
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Hmm.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:15.433
I have disdain for
those characters and their...

01:12:16.268 --> 01:12:19.427
cartoonish psychology.
But, she doesn't.

01:12:20.076 --> 01:12:22.275
Hhh, which makes her superior to me.

01:12:22.329 --> 01:12:24.482
Oh-oh, don't get jealous

01:12:24.575 --> 01:12:26.302
It's not an attractive quality.

01:12:26.378 --> 01:12:30.105
She dives head first into
a character's ambiguities, but...

01:12:31.373 --> 01:12:32.713
I don't.

01:12:33.853 --> 01:12:35.965
That's why you admire...

01:12:36.126 --> 01:12:37.718
what she does.

01:12:38.527 --> 01:12:39.591
Yes.

01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:43.762
You know, I think that when you watch her
in a movie like the one we saw tonight,

01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:45.472
there is...

01:12:45.898 --> 01:12:47.810
there is no distance there.

01:12:47.898 --> 01:12:50.085
It's normal.
It's...

01:12:50.965 --> 01:12:52.228
Cultural, right?

01:12:52.297 --> 01:12:53.868
Yes, agreed.

01:12:54.241 --> 01:12:56.164
What's wrong with my acting?

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:57.331
Nothing.

01:12:57.406 --> 01:13:00.891
What do I need to do
to make you admire me?

01:13:00.931 --> 01:13:02.821
Do I think too much?
Huh?

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:04.914
Am I too classical?

01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:07.144
Am I not liberated like Jo-Ann?

01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:10.219
You're here to talk to me,
so starting talking.

01:13:10.364 --> 01:13:11.577
Hmm?

01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:13.337
I do not know,
you...

01:13:14.337 --> 01:13:17.300
you... you can't be as
accomplished as you are

01:13:17.362 --> 01:13:20.193
and as well rounded as
an actress that you are,

01:13:20.903 --> 01:13:23.003
and still expect to hold onto
the privileges of youth,

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:24.616
it just doesn't work like that.

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:25.987
Oh.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.073
So, I'm allowed to not be old,

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.000
as long as I don't want
to be young, is that it?

01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:34.647
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess so.

01:13:35.414 --> 01:13:37.589
Yes, totally.
Well put.

01:13:41.557 --> 01:13:43.010
Fuck.

01:13:49.632 --> 01:13:51.898
I think may be a goodnight.

01:13:54.418 --> 01:13:56.374
Wait, wait, wait!

01:13:59.387 --> 01:14:02.307
You, you didn't tell me
how it went with Berndt.

01:14:04.414 --> 01:14:07.726
Yeah, well, you know,
I fuck Berndt.

01:14:08.572 --> 01:14:10.641
I thought you wouldn't
believe me anyway.

01:14:10.722 --> 01:14:11.954
Try me.

01:14:12.092 --> 01:14:14.519
Maybe you'll manage
to persuade me.

01:14:14.746 --> 01:14:16.946
I'm... exhausted.

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:19.859
I don't know.
I don't have the energy.

01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:22.681
All right.
Goodnight.

01:14:23.901 --> 01:14:25.284
Oh, I spoke to Jay.

01:14:25.318 --> 01:14:28.764
He, he doesn't think
he can get me out of the contract.

01:14:30.804 --> 01:14:32.331
Yeah, I figured.

01:14:37.852 --> 01:14:40.712
Please knock when
you enter my office.

01:14:41.892 --> 01:14:43.315
You summoned me.

01:14:43.425 --> 01:14:46.115
I didn't summon you,
I asked you to come.

01:14:46.208 --> 01:14:47.608
What's the difference?

01:14:47.706 --> 01:14:51.751
What? The difference is when I summon you,
it's for professional reasons.

01:14:51.832 --> 01:14:54.842
When I ask you to come,
it's for personal reasons.

01:14:54.975 --> 01:14:56.875
- So, it's personal.
- Yes.

01:14:56.922 --> 01:14:58.308
All the more reason not to knock.

01:14:58.348 --> 01:15:01.224
Everyone knocks before
coming into my office.

01:15:01.604 --> 01:15:04.964
I could have been in a meeting,
or on a private call.

01:15:05.247 --> 01:15:07.957
I'm surprised that
Josephine let you through.

01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:09.814
I told Josephine
it didn't concern her.

01:15:09.855 --> 01:15:12.284
- She understood perfectly well.
- Understood what?

01:15:13.257 --> 01:15:15.147
That we have a
personal relationship.

01:15:15.257 --> 01:15:18.066
Since when does Josephine know that...

01:15:18.153 --> 01:15:21.026
we have what you call a
"personal relationship."?

01:15:21.113 --> 01:15:23.221
Not to be stupid,
she has eyes.

01:15:23.369 --> 01:15:24.689
You want me to draw a picture?

01:15:24.753 --> 01:15:26.756
Please don't draw me a picture.

01:15:27.713 --> 01:15:29.816
I thought it was
between you and me.

01:15:30.843 --> 01:15:32.409
I'm appalled.

01:15:34.018 --> 01:15:36.268
Who else knows?

01:15:37.808 --> 01:15:39.275
I don't know.

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:42.704
But in an office,
word gets around pretty fast.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.338
You hired me as
your personal assistant.

01:15:45.384 --> 01:15:47.018
I'm under qualified.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:51.260
Everyone understood right away
the I could come and go as I pleased

01:15:51.294 --> 01:15:53.547
and I created a vacuum around you.

01:15:53.911 --> 01:15:55.661
To keep my hold on you.

01:15:55.733 --> 01:15:58.094
"Created a vacuum."

01:15:59.336 --> 01:16:01.261
To keep your hold.

01:16:05.707 --> 01:16:07.514
Don't you realize?

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.194
No.

01:16:09.554 --> 01:16:11.427
I don't see things that way.

01:16:11.712 --> 01:16:13.927
Then everyone else got it
before you did.

01:16:30.527 --> 01:16:32.680
Shall we stop here?

01:16:33.113 --> 01:16:34.506
Sure.

01:16:38.256 --> 01:16:40.992
Can you repeat
Sigrid's last lines?

01:16:46.792 --> 01:16:49.362
Then everyone else got it
before you did.

01:16:51.137 --> 01:16:53.919
Helena pauses
and stares at Sigrid.

01:16:55.112 --> 01:16:57.532
What started at
my place that night,...

01:16:59.542 --> 01:17:01.301
I won't deny a thing.

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:06.544
I probably wanted it,
I don't know.

01:17:08.058 --> 01:17:10.598
It's as if you put
this idea in my head.

01:17:11.017 --> 01:17:13.192
If you allowed yourself
to be manipulated,

01:17:13.245 --> 01:17:15.185
it's because you wanted it.

01:17:16.554 --> 01:17:17.791
I don't want anything.

01:17:17.851 --> 01:17:18.931
Stop!

01:17:18.986 --> 01:17:21.357
I can't stand that
condescending tone of yours!

01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:23.824
Do you want to be clear?
This can't go on!

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:25.455
Whatever you say.

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:27.701
It's... I, I thought it over,
it's finished.

01:17:27.795 --> 01:17:28.875
So, I'll leave.

01:17:28.928 --> 01:17:31.115
No, you'll stay.
You do your job well.

01:17:31.163 --> 01:17:32.940
I have no complaints.

01:17:34.812 --> 01:17:37.365
- I stay and it's finished?
- If we stop.

01:17:37.511 --> 01:17:39.647
- And act as if it never happened.
- Yes.

01:17:39.744 --> 01:17:42.240
Helena, you're not capable of that.

01:17:45.491 --> 01:17:48.378
If I stay, nothing will change.
You'll be my lover.

01:17:49.191 --> 01:17:51.104
- No.
- You will.

01:17:51.158 --> 01:17:53.374
And I'll keep keep driving
everyone else away.

01:17:53.847 --> 01:17:55.981
And I'll have a tighter
and tighter hold on you.

01:17:56.056 --> 01:17:57.406
- Is that what you want?
- No.

01:17:57.471 --> 01:18:00.212
Not necessarily.
I'm just telling you how it is.

01:18:00.446 --> 01:18:02.885
But if you want me to leave,
just say so.

01:18:08.766 --> 01:18:10.125
She doesn't speak.

01:18:10.212 --> 01:18:12.432
Say it.
It's time.

01:18:13.331 --> 01:18:15.304
End of Act Two.

01:18:19.834 --> 01:18:21.288
You hungry?

01:18:21.371 --> 01:18:22.458
Yep.

01:18:42.206 --> 01:18:44.870
"You'll be my lover."

01:18:47.044 --> 01:18:49.926
"I'll keep driving
everyone else away."

01:18:49.966 --> 01:18:52.755
"I'll have a tighter and
tighter hold on you."

01:18:52.802 --> 01:18:55.609
Honestly,
you don't find this ridiculous?

01:18:55.653 --> 01:18:57.255
Why?
Because she speaks brutally?

01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:00.102
No, because it's phony.
I don't believe it.

01:19:01.985 --> 01:19:04.842
So you don't think people can be
blinded by their own emotions?

01:19:04.891 --> 01:19:07.135
Yes, I do,
but not to that extent.

01:19:07.524 --> 01:19:09.910
It's too theoretical.

01:19:10.769 --> 01:19:12.603
Even a little stupid.

01:19:14.846 --> 01:19:16.169
It's theater.

01:19:16.216 --> 01:19:19.363
It's an interpretation of life
that can be truer than life itself.

01:19:20.452 --> 01:19:22.542
Sigrid puts Helena's
desires into words.

01:19:22.587 --> 01:19:26.288
She says the unspoken,
she... formulates it.

01:19:26.414 --> 01:19:27.562
Cruelly.

01:19:27.689 --> 01:19:28.712
Okay, cruelly.

01:19:28.766 --> 01:19:30.938
Yeah, cruelly,
because she's up to no good.

01:19:31.314 --> 01:19:33.438
You're not in the character's skin.
You...

01:19:33.512 --> 01:19:35.017
I have no choice.
I have to be them.

01:19:35.057 --> 01:19:36.617
I have to identify with them.

01:19:36.674 --> 01:19:40.207
When it's phony,
I feel it... viscerally.

01:19:42.452 --> 01:19:47.024
It can be uh... literary,
but still be true.

01:19:49.611 --> 01:19:52.372
I can feel the difference.
I can hear it.

01:20:39.259 --> 01:20:40.539
- Maria?
- Hhh?

01:20:40.626 --> 01:20:43.194
We gotta go.
The Sun's about to go down.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.403
I know a shortcut
a little further up.

01:20:51.456 --> 01:20:52.817
But, it's steep.
But, uh...

01:20:52.873 --> 01:20:55.449
it'll take us straight to Val Fex.

01:20:56.119 --> 01:20:59.152
- I htought Val Fex is that way.
- No.

01:21:03.424 --> 01:21:05.652
Are you sure this is
the right path, huh?

01:21:05.706 --> 01:21:06.919
Uh...

01:21:07.025 --> 01:21:09.012
Actually, not really.

01:21:09.187 --> 01:21:11.123
I'm not even sure
it's a path.

01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:14.846
Well, we might have pooped-up somewhere.
I don't know.

01:21:15.317 --> 01:21:17.210
I think you're right.

01:21:18.777 --> 01:21:21.163
I'm pretty sure Val Fex is um...

01:21:21.811 --> 01:21:23.540
not this way.

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:28.825
Anyway, we're heading down,
we'll wind up somewhere.

01:21:31.285 --> 01:21:33.965
I think this road
takes us to Maloja.

01:21:36.101 --> 01:21:38.514
What'll we do when
we get to Maloja?

01:21:39.438 --> 01:21:41.035
We'll take a bus.

01:21:45.995 --> 01:21:50.018
You know, you don't have to keep me on
if you find my ideas simplistic.

01:21:52.023 --> 01:21:53.718
What makes you say that?

01:21:54.685 --> 01:21:57.019
If you find my point of view...

01:21:57.858 --> 01:21:59.754
uninteresting.
I...

01:22:01.433 --> 01:22:04.327
Ah, I don't really know
what I'm doing here. I...

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:08.028
I can run lines with you,
but I don't really see the point,

01:22:08.061 --> 01:22:09.355
you can find anyone to do that.

01:22:09.401 --> 01:22:13.217
No, all I'm saying is that thinking
about a text is different from living it.

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:15.103
It's not against you.

01:22:15.344 --> 01:22:16.784
You...

01:22:17.314 --> 01:22:19.494
You hate the play
and you hate her.

01:22:22.946 --> 01:22:24.886
You don't have
to take it out on me.

01:22:25.266 --> 01:22:27.193
I'm just doing my job.

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:43.110
Ready?

01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:45.770
- You ready?
- Yes.

01:22:52.873 --> 01:22:54.486
Don't lie to me!

01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:58.779
You received a confirmation
for a flight to Tokyo!

01:22:58.839 --> 01:23:00.646
You're reading my mails now?

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.943
Aren't you ashamed?

01:23:01.984 --> 01:23:04.040
I haven't felt shame in a long time.

01:23:04.074 --> 01:23:06.172
I went through all your desk drawers,
your notebooks,

01:23:06.205 --> 01:23:08.574
and I'm doing it because
you want to leave me.

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.660
Now I know when and how.

01:23:10.794 --> 01:23:14.265
Helena is restless,
Sigrid remains poised.

01:23:14.683 --> 01:23:16.385
All you had to do was ask.

01:23:16.472 --> 01:23:19.123
Yes, I accepted a job in Tokyo.

01:23:19.222 --> 01:23:20.808
A pharmaceutical lab.

01:23:20.921 --> 01:23:23.315
I think it'll be much more interesting
than the work I'm doing here.

01:23:23.355 --> 01:23:25.915
More interesting than
what you're doing here?

01:23:26.135 --> 01:23:28.135
Ha... Haven't I given...

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.842
in to every demand you've made?

01:23:29.883 --> 01:23:33.888
No other company would have given you
that kind of responsibility, and power!

01:23:33.935 --> 01:23:35.571
Exactly.

01:23:35.852 --> 01:23:37.792
It's weighing on me.

01:23:38.344 --> 01:23:40.318
I know this place in and out.

01:23:40.401 --> 01:23:42.022
The world moves.

01:23:42.242 --> 01:23:44.775
I wanna feel that.
I wanna be part of it.

01:23:45.247 --> 01:23:48.036
I want to travel.
Switzerland is too provincial.

01:24:01.484 --> 01:24:04.224
She takes a deep breath
and regains her composure.

01:24:04.299 --> 01:24:06.764
And with me you don't feel free?

01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:09.376
You've become too
dependent on me.

01:24:09.743 --> 01:24:11.216
It's unhealthy.

01:24:11.403 --> 01:24:12.610
And what do I get in return?

01:24:12.661 --> 01:24:15.142
I give you whatever you want,
you know that!

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:16.430
Oh.

01:24:16.497 --> 01:24:20.233
Like a job at a dead-end company
that's about to go down the drain?

01:24:20.285 --> 01:24:22.479
How can you say
a thing like that?

01:24:22.527 --> 01:24:24.785
Open your eyes!
My poor Helena.

01:24:24.831 --> 01:24:26.447
I'm not your poor Helena!

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.087
Nothing I've learned here
is of any use to me.

01:24:28.122 --> 01:24:30.381
I'm not your poor Helena!

01:24:31.194 --> 01:24:32.867
It never lasts.

01:24:33.175 --> 01:24:35.841
You should listen to what
the bankers are telling you.

01:24:35.934 --> 01:24:37.195
And your board members.

01:24:37.241 --> 01:24:39.355
That's not true!

01:24:41.754 --> 01:24:45.827
God! This relationship with this...
between these women...

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.895
is disturbing.

01:24:48.009 --> 01:24:49.320
is disturbing.

01:24:49.553 --> 01:24:51.600
Nowadays, people say
"disturbing" about everything,

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:54.546
even the most conventional ideas.

01:24:55.092 --> 01:24:57.470
It's a...
it's a male fantasy.

01:24:57.542 --> 01:24:59.423
Ah, no.
It's not.

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:02.744
I don't know why I should be
helping to bring her to life.

01:25:02.801 --> 01:25:05.668
I thought you weren't saying stuff
like this when you're playing Sigrid.

01:25:05.721 --> 01:25:07.981
Well, I was a kid when
I was playing Sigrid.

01:25:08.434 --> 01:25:11.325
I, I wasn't asking
those kind of questions.

01:25:11.608 --> 01:25:13.545
Like Jo-Ann in her science fiction film?

01:25:13.605 --> 01:25:15.418
Yeah, probably.

01:25:17.367 --> 01:25:19.624
Well, don't you want to get
that innocence back?

01:25:19.812 --> 01:25:21.854
You can't get innocent twice.

01:25:21.926 --> 01:25:23.146
You can.

01:25:23.455 --> 01:25:26.327
If you just accepted Helena
the way you accepted Sigrid.

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:29.707
Obviously it's easier to relate
to strength rather than weakness.

01:25:29.928 --> 01:25:31.904
Youth is better than maturity.

01:25:32.267 --> 01:25:35.551
Cruelty is cool.
Suffering sucks.

01:25:36.897 --> 01:25:38.319
She...

01:25:38.553 --> 01:25:41.280
She's mature and she's innocent.

01:25:41.571 --> 01:25:44.773
She's innocent in her own right,
that's what I like about her.

01:25:49.864 --> 01:25:52.310
I'll make some coffee.
You want some?

01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:57.287
Cruelty is cool and
suffering sucks.

01:26:15.445 --> 01:26:17.361
You didn't answer me.

01:26:18.330 --> 01:26:20.482
You have your interpretation of the play.

01:26:20.727 --> 01:26:23.055
I think mine is just confusing you.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.446
It's frustrating me.

01:26:26.489 --> 01:26:28.006
It's uncomfortable.

01:26:28.366 --> 01:26:29.846
Not good.

01:26:38.108 --> 01:26:39.411
Stay.

01:26:43.468 --> 01:26:44.951
No, no.

01:26:45.230 --> 01:26:47.112
Please, stay.

01:26:48.627 --> 01:26:50.200
I need you.

01:28:31.291 --> 01:28:32.438
Thank you.

01:28:32.546 --> 01:28:35.255
I prefer 18th century
music to any other.

01:28:35.274 --> 01:28:37.672
It's so bright and lively.

01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:39.190
Yes, me too.

01:28:39.251 --> 01:28:41.890
Romantic music's so sad
and depressing.

01:28:42.379 --> 01:28:45.019
But, I'd rather listen to rock music
any day of the week, though.

01:28:45.072 --> 01:28:46.785
- Even the worse.
- Not me.

01:28:46.872 --> 01:28:49.232
I've had too much of it,
I'm sick of it.

01:28:49.305 --> 01:28:51.645
Oh, you're such a snob!

01:28:51.856 --> 01:28:54.128
No, tastes can get worn out.

01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:56.281
Kinda like desire.

01:28:57.387 --> 01:29:00.507
I've never listened to Handel properly.
I think he's excellent.

01:29:00.707 --> 01:29:03.530
I haven't been this moved
by music in ages.

01:29:05.057 --> 01:29:06.743
You're making fun of me.

01:29:06.856 --> 01:29:09.076
I'm not.
But, I just...

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:13.888
I find it really cute that you're
trying to put up with my ideas.

01:29:14.118 --> 01:29:16.118
You know I'm not a music whiz.

01:29:16.209 --> 01:29:19.128
I mean, besides that my family
practically spoon fed me

01:29:19.154 --> 01:29:20.921
which is incredibly specialized

01:29:20.961 --> 01:29:23.857
I don't know a thing about music.

01:29:25.728 --> 01:29:27.224
Thank you.

01:29:27.866 --> 01:29:28.895
So...

01:29:28.944 --> 01:29:30.601
How did it go with your wife?

01:29:30.688 --> 01:29:32.211
Very well.

01:29:32.455 --> 01:29:34.675
No, I'm kidding.
It was horrible.

01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:36.820
But you know, she...

01:29:36.887 --> 01:29:39.107
she's not the type
to wear her heart on her sleeve.

01:29:39.167 --> 01:29:41.367
I think she was expecting it.

01:29:41.487 --> 01:29:42.721
Did you tell her about me?

01:29:42.767 --> 01:29:44.554
No, I said, you know,...

01:29:44.595 --> 01:29:47.727
I'd be going off on my own
to write my book and wouldn't be back.

01:29:47.788 --> 01:29:49.605
Then she must be
suspecting something.

01:29:49.644 --> 01:29:51.517
She has no idea
you and I know each other.

01:29:51.564 --> 01:29:54.197
Well, she will.
I mean, when it hits the tabloids.

01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:56.037
They're not gonna find us here.

01:29:56.077 --> 01:29:58.967
They can find us anywhere.
It's their job, you know.

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:01.387
Did you say anything
to Maria Enders?

01:30:01.433 --> 01:30:03.610
Just that I'll be taking
advantage of my press tour

01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:05.124
and come and say "Hi" to her.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.954
She didn't find that strange?

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:08.299
I talked to her assistant,

01:30:08.345 --> 01:30:11.412
nd she didn't seem to question it.
So, I guess not.

01:30:26.668 --> 01:30:29.061
Hey, she's over there.

01:30:29.128 --> 01:30:30.448
- Hi.
- Hi!

01:30:30.473 --> 01:30:31.208
Hi.

01:30:31.241 --> 01:30:33.375
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

01:30:33.626 --> 01:30:35.337
- Wow!
- What?

01:30:35.389 --> 01:30:37.551
I never would have recognized you.

01:30:37.604 --> 01:30:38.620
- Really?
- Hhh.

01:30:38.647 --> 01:30:40.867
Well, I mean, if you've only seen me
on the internet or in a movie,

01:30:40.901 --> 01:30:43.674
- that's not really a big surprise.
- I apologize, it's a little weird.

01:30:43.731 --> 01:30:46.461
Well, you, on the other hand,
look exactly like all your roles.

01:30:46.828 --> 01:30:49.014
I hope not all of them.

01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:51.371
No, no, no.
Only the better ones.

01:30:51.761 --> 01:30:54.538
Rest assured that
you don't look like Nemesis.

01:30:55.351 --> 01:30:57.197
This is Chris.
He's a... he's a novelist.

01:30:57.244 --> 01:30:58.857
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you, Chris.

01:30:58.904 --> 01:31:00.214
- My assistant, Kate.
- Hi.

01:31:00.247 --> 01:31:02.527
It's, it's so good to meet
the both of you, seriously.

01:31:02.594 --> 01:31:03.734
Yeah.

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.080
Hello!

01:31:05.127 --> 01:31:06.908
May I get you
anything to drink?

01:31:07.001 --> 01:31:08.803
- A cognac for me, please.
- Yeah.

01:31:08.903 --> 01:31:10.696
- I'll have the same.
- Okay.

01:31:10.736 --> 01:31:12.550
- I'm fine, thanks.
- All right.

01:31:12.583 --> 01:31:14.440
What herbal teas do you have?

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.527
We have verbena,
mint and chamomile.

01:31:17.596 --> 01:31:18.830
I'll take chamomile, please.

01:31:18.863 --> 01:31:20.607
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

01:31:23.176 --> 01:31:27.470
I don't think you understand
how much of an honor this is for me.

01:31:27.574 --> 01:31:29.792
When I was 15,
I saw um...

01:31:30.025 --> 01:31:33.355
Oh, my God, the movie you did,
with the CIA and Harrison Ford.

01:31:33.461 --> 01:31:36.161
- I'm so sorry, I'm blanking out.
- "A Beetle on its Back"

01:31:36.201 --> 01:31:38.283
"A Beetle on its Back"
with Harrison Ford.

01:31:38.329 --> 01:31:39.797
You blew my mind.

01:31:39.847 --> 01:31:41.491
You, you...

01:31:41.849 --> 01:31:43.407
You were the epitome of class.

01:31:43.495 --> 01:31:46.045
You were everything
I ever wanted to be as an actress.

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:48.345
And I mean the way that
you battled those politicians

01:31:48.385 --> 01:31:51.518
and then the military brass men,
it was, it was captivating.

01:31:51.564 --> 01:31:54.626
It was my first Hollywood film
I was in, and the last.

01:31:54.975 --> 01:31:56.322
Um...

01:31:56.651 --> 01:31:58.384
Sydney Pollack was really nice.

01:31:58.418 --> 01:32:00.678
But, sometimes I didn't understand
what he was saying,

01:32:00.718 --> 01:32:02.351
so I was too shy to ask.

01:32:02.443 --> 01:32:05.785
But fortunately,
Harrison was there to help.

01:32:05.903 --> 01:32:07.225
A lot.

01:32:09.193 --> 01:32:12.003
Well, then, of course,
after that I... I begged

01:32:12.056 --> 01:32:15.300
my parents to let me see you on stage,
and the "The Seagull". And...

01:32:15.399 --> 01:32:18.272
They didn't know who you were
before then because...

01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:20.125
well, they kinda hate movies.

01:32:20.325 --> 01:32:22.231
Well, I hope they tolerate the theater.

01:32:22.281 --> 01:32:23.334
No, no.

01:32:23.374 --> 01:32:24.814
They don't just tolerate the theatre,

01:32:24.854 --> 01:32:26.534
I mean, they, they're
absolutely in love with it.

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:28.371
In fact, they see everything in.
And...

01:32:28.464 --> 01:32:31.424
And... um, you know,
when they saw your performance,

01:32:31.464 --> 01:32:33.891
they said it was the best Nina
they'd ever seen.

01:32:34.343 --> 01:32:36.292
And that meant a lot to me.

01:32:36.526 --> 01:32:38.729
Because that's uh, you know,
before that I...

01:32:38.856 --> 01:32:41.402
I'd never been able to tell them
that I wanted to be an actress.

01:32:41.442 --> 01:32:42.689
But, because of you...

01:32:42.786 --> 01:32:44.859
I can pursue my vocation.

01:32:45.018 --> 01:32:47.352
I, I prefer your early French films.

01:32:47.385 --> 01:32:49.598
There was, there was a cycle
at the ICA in London.

01:32:49.651 --> 01:32:51.642
- Uh-huh.
- I, I saw almost all of them.

01:32:51.683 --> 01:32:52.903
And you came.

01:32:52.937 --> 01:32:54.386
You, you probably
don't remember.

01:32:54.433 --> 01:32:56.893
Oh, I remember it perfectly well.

01:32:56.986 --> 01:33:00.803
I was fascinated by how freely
you spoke about your work.

01:33:00.838 --> 01:33:03.581
And um uh
someone asked you um...

01:33:03.694 --> 01:33:06.468
if you had any regrets,
and you said...

01:33:06.574 --> 01:33:08.390
"We're not allowed to regret anything.

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.590
If we're sincere,

01:33:09.630 --> 01:33:11.997
then we're the sum total
of our experiences,

01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:13.570
with no exceptions."

01:33:13.998 --> 01:33:15.245
I said that?

01:33:15.309 --> 01:33:17.382
Well, not word for word.
Something like that.

01:33:17.432 --> 01:33:19.232
And you don't think that anymore?

01:33:19.285 --> 01:33:21.152
Oh, uh...
No. Um...

01:33:21.307 --> 01:33:26.763
I... I completely agree with that,
one hundred percent.

01:33:28.872 --> 01:33:32.465
You know, I am, I'm incredibly
intimidated to take on your role.

01:33:32.552 --> 01:33:35.332
I mean, no-one's gonna be able
to do it like you did, and...

01:33:35.405 --> 01:33:37.301
I hope you don't
judge me too harshly.

01:33:37.407 --> 01:33:39.828
Um, we'll all have our own way
into a character.

01:33:39.861 --> 01:33:41.001
They're all good.

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:43.474
Well, I cannot wait to do
the re-do tomorrow.

01:33:43.516 --> 01:33:46.262
We are working at Wilhelm's chalet,
I hope that's okay with you?

01:33:46.302 --> 01:33:47.302
Yeah, sure.

01:33:47.342 --> 01:33:50.392
As long as his ghost isn't
watching over us the entire time.

01:33:50.438 --> 01:33:51.765
I can't promise you that.

01:33:51.812 --> 01:33:53.899
But don't worry,
he's a well-meaning ghost.

01:33:53.991 --> 01:33:55.435
Oh, "Well meaning".

01:33:55.781 --> 01:33:57.068
I don't know about that.

01:33:57.115 --> 01:33:58.501
Nor do I.

01:34:00.294 --> 01:34:04.695
You know, it's incredibly brave of you
to take on the role of Helena.

01:34:05.009 --> 01:34:08.596
It's...
it's her way of dealing with time.

01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:12.013
Yeah, it was.
I don't know, sometimes I...

01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:15.983
I tell myself that it's just a job.

01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:19.786
And I'll be happy
to move on when it's over.

01:34:20.206 --> 01:34:21.577
Hey.

01:34:22.308 --> 01:34:23.314
Thank you.

01:34:23.351 --> 01:34:25.824
You still want to see the "Snake",
you asked me the other day?

01:34:25.864 --> 01:34:26.978
Oh, yeah.

01:34:27.024 --> 01:34:29.784
The weather they're predicting
for tomorrow seems ideal.

01:34:29.823 --> 01:34:32.403
So, you better make sure
you're out there at daybreak.

01:34:32.451 --> 01:34:35.382
It's wonderful to see it
coming over the Maloja Pass.

01:34:35.456 --> 01:34:37.249
Great! Awesome!
That's amazing.

01:34:37.325 --> 01:34:38.682
- Thank you!
- Yep.

01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:42.805
I thought they were really nice.

01:34:43.958 --> 01:34:45.451
Yeah, it's true!
I, I...

01:34:45.506 --> 01:34:48.992
She's a lot more interesting
than the person you described.

01:34:49.232 --> 01:34:50.939
I didn't know
her parents were musicians,

01:34:50.972 --> 01:34:53.666
and I liked them too.
It's...

01:34:56.258 --> 01:34:59.191
What's so funny?
Did I say something funny?

01:35:00.013 --> 01:35:02.786
They spent the whole
evening flattering you,

01:35:03.019 --> 01:35:04.479
of course, you liked them.

01:35:04.559 --> 01:35:06.032
That has nothing to do with it.

01:35:06.085 --> 01:35:08.048
No, no.
Of course not.

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.480
Repeat that!

01:35:22.024 --> 01:35:23.373
What?

01:35:24.723 --> 01:35:27.397
What was that movie?
"A Beetle on its back.".

01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.548
I can't believe
we got the scoop tonight!

01:35:32.585 --> 01:35:33.875
What scoop?

01:35:33.921 --> 01:35:36.355
She's with Christopher Giles.

01:35:36.401 --> 01:35:38.898
Chris? His name is
Christopher Giles?

01:35:39.018 --> 01:35:41.145
- Yes.
- Is he famous?

01:35:41.311 --> 01:35:44.358
He's...
Ã¼ber famous.

01:35:44.929 --> 01:35:47.905
I can't remember which major
book prize he won, but...

01:35:49.467 --> 01:35:50.867
he's married.

01:35:50.914 --> 01:35:53.867
He's with Dorothea Von Duisburg.
The German artist?

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.754
Should've showed
the serpentine monster.

01:36:00.167 --> 01:36:02.484
Never heard of neither of them!!

01:36:02.604 --> 01:36:03.937
Who?

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:07.017
I mean, you should Google him.

01:36:07.134 --> 01:36:09.154
How do you spell his name?

01:36:09.368 --> 01:36:10.675
Giles.

01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:12.101
G-I-L-E-S.

01:36:12.156 --> 01:36:14.569
Well, he's obviously with her.

01:36:16.183 --> 01:36:17.316
Yeah!

01:36:17.436 --> 01:36:19.496
When word gets out,
it's gonna be,...

01:36:19.530 --> 01:36:21.456
like,...
a tsunami.

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:25.393
Oh, yeah.
On their planet.

01:36:25.447 --> 01:36:27.287
Their planet has a name.

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.687
It's called the "real world."

01:36:29.775 --> 01:36:31.052
Welcome!

01:36:32.844 --> 01:36:34.147
Careful with that.

01:36:34.194 --> 01:36:35.634
Come here.
Give that here to me.

01:36:35.721 --> 01:36:36.927
Stop fighting!

01:36:37.235 --> 01:36:38.362
Here.

01:36:54.722 --> 01:36:58.032
I spent all night thinking
about Helena's death.

01:36:58.451 --> 01:36:59.738
Her death?

01:37:00.072 --> 01:37:01.542
She doesn't necessarily die.

01:37:01.595 --> 01:37:03.961
She just...
She disappears.

01:37:04.122 --> 01:37:05.988
That's your interpretation.

01:37:06.071 --> 01:37:08.745
Well, it's...
it's pretty ambiguous.

01:37:09.264 --> 01:37:11.777
She goes out for a hike
and never comes back,

01:37:11.817 --> 01:37:13.737
seems clear enough to me.

01:37:14.534 --> 01:37:16.183
You don't know that.

01:37:16.255 --> 01:37:18.391
She could reinvent herself
somewhere else.

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:19.937
There's really no way of knowing.

01:37:19.983 --> 01:37:21.928
You know, you can imagine
whatever you want.

01:37:21.995 --> 01:37:23.862
Are we going the right way?

01:37:23.995 --> 01:37:26.476
I mean, I don't mind waking up
at the crack of dawn,

01:37:26.516 --> 01:37:29.135
but not to get lost in
the mountains and miss the "Snake"!

01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:31.889
Well, we're basically here.
You happy?

01:37:32.025 --> 01:37:34.134
What makes you think we're here?

01:37:34.788 --> 01:37:37.100
I've got a map!
You want me to show you?

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.433
Come here.

01:37:40.503 --> 01:37:43.699
This is the bend we just went around.
Ten minutes ago?

01:37:43.766 --> 01:37:45.751
And just around there
is the view of the valley.

01:37:45.799 --> 01:37:47.958
- See that?
- How do you know?

01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:49.472
How do...?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.695
Pain in the ass!
Jesus Christ!

01:37:55.211 --> 01:37:57.996
I don't know why you're so dead-set
on making this play say

01:37:58.036 --> 01:38:00.656
the opposite of what
it was meant to say.

01:38:00.932 --> 01:38:02.106
At twenty,...

01:38:02.967 --> 01:38:05.880
you saw Sigrid's ambition
and you saw her violence

01:38:05.926 --> 01:38:07.673
because you felt it in yourself.

01:38:07.718 --> 01:38:08.726
So?

01:38:08.835 --> 01:38:12.061
So, what I'm saying is...
the text is like an object.

01:38:12.753 --> 01:38:15.900
It's gonna change perspective
based on where you're standing.

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.000
I don't know...

01:38:20.242 --> 01:38:22.036
We should go.
we're gonna miss the "Snake".

01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:23.689
Won't be any "Snake".

01:38:24.934 --> 01:38:26.268
Ah, fuck it.

01:38:26.402 --> 01:38:27.766
Whatever.

01:39:18.153 --> 01:39:19.586
Look there!

01:39:20.942 --> 01:39:22.986
Is that the "Snake"?

01:39:25.041 --> 01:39:26.257
No.

01:39:27.391 --> 01:39:29.327
No, it's just mist.

01:39:29.931 --> 01:39:31.464
Oh, fuck.

01:39:32.234 --> 01:39:33.951
When it breaks up.

01:39:36.788 --> 01:39:39.239
It's still pretty beautiful though.

01:39:39.568 --> 01:39:43.298
It's like it's gathering and
pouring out into the valley.

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:47.855
Or maybe it is the "Snake".

01:39:49.556 --> 01:39:51.273
We have to be patient.

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:56.426
No, it's not the "Snake".
It...

01:39:56.726 --> 01:39:58.255
Oh, yes!

01:39:58.913 --> 01:40:01.681
I think it's turning into the "Snake"!

01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:03.679
How about you?

01:40:04.951 --> 01:40:06.039
Val?

01:40:08.099 --> 01:40:10.186
What the hell are you doing?

01:40:12.405 --> 01:40:13.704
Val?

01:40:16.055 --> 01:40:17.450
Val!

01:40:18.525 --> 01:40:19.691
Val!

01:40:21.854 --> 01:40:23.076
Val!

01:40:27.255 --> 01:40:28.631
Val!

01:40:29.448 --> 01:40:31.464
Answer me!

01:40:33.449 --> 01:40:35.092
Val!

01:40:38.915 --> 01:40:40.219
Val!

01:41:53.035 --> 01:41:57.451
EPILOGUE
LONDON, A FEW WEEKS LATER

01:42:03.402 --> 01:42:05.156
How's the hotel?

01:42:05.387 --> 01:42:08.643
The hotel's fine.
Oh, thanks for the flowers.

01:42:08.695 --> 01:42:12.447
So, did you reach Klaus?
He was really impatient to see you.

01:42:12.494 --> 01:42:15.267
You have to return his calls, you know?
He thinks you're avoiding him.

01:42:15.296 --> 01:42:17.975
We're having dinner.
He's a half hour late.

01:42:18.203 --> 01:42:20.732
Oh, so, you called me to kill time.

01:42:20.907 --> 01:42:22.316
Just kidding.

01:42:22.627 --> 01:42:24.537
I'm not avoiding him.
I...

01:42:24.639 --> 01:42:26.219
I want to talk to him one-on-one.

01:42:26.274 --> 01:42:28.597
You know how reluctant I was.
I'm over that now.

01:42:28.652 --> 01:42:31.592
You know, Klaus understands
the risks you're taking.

01:42:31.634 --> 01:42:32.977
I know he's sincere.

01:42:33.021 --> 01:42:35.692
He's doing this for you
and for Wilhelm's memory.

01:42:35.739 --> 01:42:37.318
And for the publicity.

01:42:37.489 --> 01:42:40.068
Twenty years after being Sigrid,
I'm Helena.

01:42:40.122 --> 01:42:42.529
That's all the press is talking about.

01:42:42.829 --> 01:42:45.808
You know, he's like every artist of
his generation.

01:42:45.862 --> 01:42:47.815
He has a flair for P.R.

01:42:47.846 --> 01:42:49.206
Oh, and is that a crime?

01:42:49.232 --> 01:42:54.011
"To excel and to know how to show it
is to excel twice."

01:42:54.351 --> 01:42:56.444
Baltasar Gracian said that.

01:42:56.539 --> 01:42:58.952
I have no idea who that is.

01:42:59.021 --> 01:43:00.300
But, he was right.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:03.071
The press is talking
about you and your work.

01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:05.083
Oh, I said "OK" to pictures,
knowing of you.

01:43:05.123 --> 01:43:06.683
It is too soon, too fragile.

01:43:06.733 --> 01:43:07.897
Hold on!

01:43:09.330 --> 01:43:10.530
Yes?

01:43:12.086 --> 01:43:14.106
Uh, tell him I'm on my way down.

01:43:14.318 --> 01:43:15.526
Thank you.

01:43:17.199 --> 01:43:18.470
It's Klaus.

01:43:19.183 --> 01:43:20.570
You'll be fine.

01:43:23.798 --> 01:43:24.938
Hi.

01:43:25.765 --> 01:43:26.972
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:43:27.017 --> 01:43:29.824
Excuse me, I'm late.
But, something terrible has happened.

01:43:30.886 --> 01:43:33.754
Dorothea tried to commit suicide.
She's in a coma.

01:43:33.796 --> 01:43:34.844
Dorothea?

01:43:34.904 --> 01:43:36.747
Christopher Giles' wife.

01:43:37.676 --> 01:43:40.881
Chris, uh, Jo-Ann's friend,
you mean?

01:43:41.108 --> 01:43:43.751
Yes, but you're not supposed
to know he's Jo-Ann's friend.

01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:45.911
Well, they were together in Sils.
So...

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:47.911
I thought it was more
recent than that...

01:43:48.038 --> 01:43:49.991
Excuse me, sir.
We can go.

01:43:50.394 --> 01:43:53.665
Well, she slit her wrists
in the studio.

01:43:54.032 --> 01:43:57.012
The housekeeper found her
in a pool of her own blood.

01:43:57.111 --> 01:43:58.779
Oh, that's awful.

01:44:00.326 --> 01:44:02.119
She's a well known artist, right?

01:44:02.243 --> 01:44:04.093
Dorothea's an amazing girl.

01:44:04.346 --> 01:44:07.687
Beautiful, talented,
everything going for her.

01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:10.191
I love her work.

01:44:10.538 --> 01:44:12.385
I don't understand.

01:44:12.987 --> 01:44:14.854
Jo-Ann is devastated.

01:44:14.927 --> 01:44:17.000
She was at an exhibition.

01:44:17.391 --> 01:44:21.911
She can't go back to the hotel.
The paparazzi have surrounded the place.

01:44:22.684 --> 01:44:25.250
I suggested she join us.
You don't mind?

01:44:25.378 --> 01:44:26.950
No, of course not.

01:44:59.507 --> 01:45:03.023
It's still just a rumor,
but the press knew something was up.

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:06.613
Someone posted in her blog that
it was the real reason

01:45:06.659 --> 01:45:08.973
that Jo-Ann had accepted
to do a play in London.

01:45:09.033 --> 01:45:10.392
And is that true?

01:45:10.446 --> 01:45:12.283
She doesn't need a pretext
to act in London,

01:45:12.329 --> 01:45:14.776
but the paparazzi will never let go.

01:45:14.866 --> 01:45:18.622
They need her picture with Christopher.
And they're going wild.

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:26.530
She's in her car.
She'll be here in five minutes.

01:45:29.866 --> 01:45:31.293
You wanted to talk to me?

01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:33.193
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

01:45:34.553 --> 01:45:37.341
I had a long conversation
with Rose last night.

01:45:37.413 --> 01:45:40.057
I told her that we were in London
that we were about...

01:45:40.237 --> 01:45:41.917
to start rehearsals.

01:45:42.081 --> 01:45:43.649
That made her happy, I think.

01:45:43.726 --> 01:45:47.024
I know. Now all we have to do is
not disappoint you.

01:45:48.936 --> 01:45:52.643
On thos tray, Chateau Laroze.
Thank you.

01:45:53.461 --> 01:45:57.284
Rosa gave me fragments from
Wilhelm's follow-up to "Maloja's Snake".

01:45:57.374 --> 01:45:59.027
A sign of her trust.

01:45:59.456 --> 01:46:02.996
Some of the pages make
no sense out of context, but...

01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:06.210
there are a few others that
put the play in a new light.

01:46:06.384 --> 01:46:08.998
How old was Wilhelm
when he wrote "Maloja's Snake."?

01:46:09.075 --> 01:46:10.648
Thirty-five or so?

01:46:11.036 --> 01:46:13.392
- Hmmm... 38.
-38?!

01:46:13.432 --> 01:46:15.373
Yeah, a little older
when he made the film.

01:46:15.414 --> 01:46:17.973
Well, he was still a young man,
all action.

01:46:19.403 --> 01:46:22.264
Twenty-five years later,
obviously, he was more analytical,

01:46:22.295 --> 01:46:24.184
trying to put the things in perspective,

01:46:24.218 --> 01:46:27.152
maybe, thinking about posterity.
Who knows?

01:46:27.678 --> 01:46:30.945
Isn't it better to stay faithful
to his youthful energy?

01:46:31.134 --> 01:46:33.720
- And forget the new scenes?
- Yes.

01:46:35.247 --> 01:46:37.760
Wilhelm never had any
distance or maturity.

01:46:37.808 --> 01:46:41.118
On the contrary,
his last texts got bolder and bolder,

01:46:41.172 --> 01:46:43.878
and more and more...
enigmatic.

01:46:44.834 --> 01:46:46.942
Here's another way
of looking at it.

01:46:47.671 --> 01:46:49.234
We think like him.

01:46:49.541 --> 01:46:52.511
We, we project ourselves
into the future,

01:46:52.557 --> 01:46:54.684
instead of freezing ourselves in the past

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.993
Or if we...
Jo-Ann!

01:46:57.254 --> 01:46:58.540
Hey.

01:46:58.643 --> 01:46:59.908
What's happening?

01:46:59.995 --> 01:47:01.481
She's hanging on by a thread.

01:47:01.554 --> 01:47:03.401
She's lost a lot of blood,
but, uh...

01:47:03.496 --> 01:47:05.139
the doctors won't tell us anything.

01:47:05.164 --> 01:47:07.492
I mean, Chris said she was
really relaxed when he told her.

01:47:07.526 --> 01:47:09.402
She was just getting used to
the new situation.

01:47:09.438 --> 01:47:10.978
Where is Christopher?

01:47:11.346 --> 01:47:13.318
Dorothea's family
got in from Germany.

01:47:13.382 --> 01:47:15.414
And so he... he told them
to leave the hospital.

01:47:15.455 --> 01:47:17.080
So they're gonna come join us.

01:47:17.131 --> 01:47:19.251
Here?
But, that's ridiculous.

01:47:19.298 --> 01:47:22.091
He will have all the paparazzi
from the hospital on his trail.

01:47:22.136 --> 01:47:24.203
No, he said there were no paparazzi.
He'd know.

01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:26.679
He's being naive.
Of course, they are tailing him.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.633
They are just doing it discreetly.
Tell him absolutely not to join us.

01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:37.481
Come on, Chris.

01:47:37.534 --> 01:47:40.334
His voicemail's turned off.
I'll just text him.

01:47:40.801 --> 01:47:42.934
If they're following you,
we are stuck.

01:47:43.954 --> 01:47:46.814
- Do you have the driver?
- Yeah, he's outside.

01:47:47.474 --> 01:47:50.120
Okay. Tell Christopher
to meet us at my club.

01:47:50.162 --> 01:47:52.160
At least, we'll have
some peace and quiet.

01:47:52.524 --> 01:47:54.269
- He's here.
- Chris!

01:47:54.562 --> 01:47:55.911
Hey, hey.

01:47:56.085 --> 01:47:57.551
Are you all right?

01:47:57.984 --> 01:48:00.344
- Did you get my messages?
- Um...

01:48:00.914 --> 01:48:04.024
Klaus thinks that the paparazzi
are following you from the hospital.

01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:07.416
I don't know.
I didn't see any.

01:48:07.722 --> 01:48:10.296
They can get a picture of us tonight,
it'll be a total disaster.

01:48:10.336 --> 01:48:11.924
I mean, it'll spread like wildfire.

01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:13.602
I'm gonna call my driver.

01:48:15.767 --> 01:48:17.619
Hey Emily,
come pick us up.

01:48:18.046 --> 01:48:19.833
- All right.
- Here...

01:48:20.618 --> 01:48:22.386
The address of my club.

01:48:22.607 --> 01:48:26.176
We go first, wait 5 minutes,
take a taxi and join us.

01:48:52.410 --> 01:48:54.777
Oh, fuck!
They're following us.

01:48:56.949 --> 01:48:58.239
Hey, Ari?

01:48:58.592 --> 01:49:00.965
No, there's, there's
no news here from the hospital.

01:49:01.122 --> 01:49:03.465
Yeah, I could really
use you right now.

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.365
Whatever the first plane out is.

01:49:06.451 --> 01:49:09.345
I'm stuck here in London
till the end of the year.

01:49:09.411 --> 01:49:11.098
Rehearsals start tomorrow.

01:49:11.372 --> 01:49:12.966
If she doesn't make it,...

01:49:13.606 --> 01:49:16.552
it's gonna be a nuclear fucking winter.

01:49:17.175 --> 01:49:19.235
What do you want to do?
Change hotels?

01:49:19.382 --> 01:49:20.389
No way.

01:49:20.442 --> 01:49:23.048
Wherever I go, they're just
gonna find me and chase me down.

01:49:23.459 --> 01:49:25.230
I'll rather stay where I am.

01:49:25.463 --> 01:49:26.763
You know, it's...

01:49:26.907 --> 01:49:28.083
I'm fine with it.

01:49:28.203 --> 01:49:29.830
It must be hard for Chris.

01:49:29.902 --> 01:49:31.837
The media is going to crucify him.

01:49:31.888 --> 01:49:33.777
No, no.
I'll take the heat.

01:49:33.989 --> 01:49:35.797
I'll be the home wrecker.

01:49:36.352 --> 01:49:38.125
I'm used to the nasty shit
written about me.

01:49:38.166 --> 01:49:39.326
I can obviously care less.

01:49:39.395 --> 01:49:41.500
Do you want us to cancel
tomorrow's rehearsal?

01:49:41.661 --> 01:49:43.227
Maria, would you mind?

01:49:43.285 --> 01:49:44.747
Mmm, of course not.

01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:45.804
No way.

01:49:45.851 --> 01:49:47.084
- Mmm.
- No, I don't.

01:49:47.167 --> 01:49:48.577
I'd rather work.

01:49:53.428 --> 01:49:55.108
We didn't get to talk much?

01:49:55.266 --> 01:49:56.311
No

01:49:56.767 --> 01:49:59.328
I'll have the new scenes
dropped off at the front desk.

01:49:59.368 --> 01:50:01.723
And we'll talk about them seriously.

01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:04.670
Yeah, we can do that tomorrow.
After rehearsal.

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:08.676
I'm drained after a work day.
It's not the best time for me.

01:50:08.715 --> 01:50:10.916
I know.
It's the same for me.

01:50:11.145 --> 01:50:15.198
And next weekend, I have to see
my kids in southern Italy.

01:50:16.665 --> 01:50:17.916
We'll manage.

01:50:17.979 --> 01:50:19.239
Okay, good night.

01:50:19.325 --> 01:50:20.612
Good night.

01:50:30.823 --> 01:50:33.557
When I tell you about you,
how much I appreciate you,

01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:35.337
it's to remind me,

01:50:35.406 --> 01:50:39.066
how happy they are to grant you
what they never granted me.

01:50:39.972 --> 01:50:41.448
They're using you...

01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:55.010
Hi.

01:50:55.043 --> 01:50:56.716
I printed everything out.

01:50:56.756 --> 01:50:59.749
If you want an English solicitor
to take a look at the papers, tell me.

01:50:59.889 --> 01:51:02.889
I know a bilingual girl
who specializes in Paris real estate.

01:51:05.501 --> 01:51:06.862
That's the sales agreement.

01:51:06.903 --> 01:51:10.161
Your ex-husband is buying your half of
the apartment for the price you agreed to.

01:51:10.215 --> 01:51:12.261
Oh, no, I don't want to discuss it

01:51:12.443 --> 01:51:14.116
Maybe, I was wrong.

01:51:14.362 --> 01:51:17.282
And that's the sales agreement
for the Studio on the Rue du Chemin Vert.

01:51:17.349 --> 01:51:19.841
Yeah, it's expensive,
but it's worth it.

01:51:20.561 --> 01:51:23.036
- You say he's ready to sign?
- Tomorrow, as planned.

01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:25.217
You take the Eurostar at 8:15,

01:51:25.443 --> 01:51:28.370
leave Paris at 5:00, and you'll be
back in London in time for dinner.

01:51:28.493 --> 01:51:30.300
- Okay.
- If you want, I can travel with you.

01:51:30.346 --> 01:51:31.893
No, I'm fine.

01:51:36.731 --> 01:51:39.057
What do I tell Piers Roaldson?

01:51:39.277 --> 01:51:40.891
Remind me who he is.

01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:44.604
He's shooting a film at Sains
called "Electric Shockwave".

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:46.980
What has he done?

01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.860
Nothing.
He's twenty-five.

01:51:49.146 --> 01:51:52.003
But, Jay says he's good and
that has been "green lit".

01:51:52.692 --> 01:51:53.905
What's the part?

01:51:54.043 --> 01:51:55.892
They haven't sent it over yet.

01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:57.738
It's the lead?

01:51:57.817 --> 01:52:01.427
I think your character will be
some sort of hybrid.

01:52:02.528 --> 01:52:05.533
Mmm, a creation of modern genetics,
but with a soul.

01:52:06.034 --> 01:52:08.687
It's set in the near future,
the 23rd century.

01:52:09.249 --> 01:52:10.507
On Earth?

01:52:11.303 --> 01:52:13.543
Maybe, I'm not sure.

01:52:15.446 --> 01:52:16.779
Hi.

01:52:17.314 --> 01:52:19.270
- Where?
- Over there.

01:52:19.737 --> 01:52:21.177
Thank you.

01:52:21.477 --> 01:52:23.385
Um, tell Piers,
I'm interested, and uh...

01:52:23.479 --> 01:52:25.553
I'll read the script
next week, okay?

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.515
And uh...there are
the new scenes Klaus sent you?

01:52:28.555 --> 01:52:29.939
Oh, yes, I forgot.

01:52:30.122 --> 01:52:31.629
Want to try the lines?

01:52:32.272 --> 01:52:34.785
No, I haven't read the pages yet.

01:52:35.311 --> 01:52:36.678
He wants to know what you think.

01:52:36.779 --> 01:52:38.490
Why doesn't he just call me?

01:52:38.883 --> 01:52:40.876
Maybe, he's waiting
for your reaction.

01:52:41.322 --> 01:52:43.189
You've had the scenes
for two weeks.

01:52:43.422 --> 01:52:44.816
Yeah, I understand.

01:52:45.506 --> 01:52:49.306
But, I'd rather discover them at the last
minute and not over-think it. It's...

01:52:49.406 --> 01:52:51.752
it's the only way
I can keep it spontaneous.

01:52:52.471 --> 01:52:55.411
It's how I um...
prepared Sigrid 20 years ago.

01:52:55.464 --> 01:52:57.686
I'll do the same thing
with Helena.

01:52:58.644 --> 01:53:01.951
If he asks you, just tell him
I think they're very good.

01:54:01.212 --> 01:54:03.818
Very good.
But, it's still a little long.

01:54:04.422 --> 01:54:06.945
- Jo-Ann, can you hear me?
- Uh, yeah.

01:54:07.135 --> 01:54:09.331
Do the same thing,
but speed it up a little.

01:54:09.391 --> 01:54:10.285
Okay.

01:54:10.311 --> 01:54:12.008
Why don't you just
forget one of the files?

01:54:12.041 --> 01:54:13.340
There are plenty.

01:54:13.417 --> 01:54:15.495
- We do it one more time.
- Okay.

01:54:18.939 --> 01:54:20.305
Excuse me.

01:54:20.888 --> 01:54:22.842
Tomorrow is our final dress rehearsal.

01:54:22.883 --> 01:54:25.482
- I know, thanks for taking the time.
- My pleasure.

01:54:25.944 --> 01:54:27.782
I'll just switch this on.

01:54:28.602 --> 01:54:31.175
Uh, may I have
a cup of coffee, please.

01:54:31.548 --> 01:54:33.711
Well, you can imagine
my first question.

01:54:33.797 --> 01:54:38.178
Will the media frenzy around
Jo-Ann Ellis steal the spotlight.

01:54:38.948 --> 01:54:41.961
All that matters is the show,
the rest is of no importance.

01:54:42.025 --> 01:54:45.087
And fortunately,
Dorothea pulled through.

01:54:45.329 --> 01:54:47.365
I know you have a new take on it,
but...

01:54:47.475 --> 01:54:50.772
will the audience be receptive?
Or might they be too distracted?

01:54:50.825 --> 01:54:52.619
I, I suppose that's my question.

01:54:52.769 --> 01:54:54.736
I hope they'll be receptive.

01:54:54.946 --> 01:54:59.906
So, so you think the shows are air-tight,
no connection to the outside world?

01:55:00.035 --> 01:55:01.145
No

01:55:01.398 --> 01:55:04.392
No, each theatre goer
brings his own subjectivity.

01:55:04.507 --> 01:55:07.792
And it's generally
not defined by tabloid headlines.

01:55:08.234 --> 01:55:10.150
Some will go for the smell of scandal.

01:55:10.196 --> 01:55:14.137
So will they see the show you had in mind,
or something else?

01:55:16.108 --> 01:55:17.155
Jo-Ann!

01:55:17.239 --> 01:55:18.292
What's up?

01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:20.036
I wanted to ask you.

01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:22.923
You know the scene
at the beginning act three,

01:55:22.952 --> 01:55:25.136
when you tell me you wanna leave,
and...

01:55:25.276 --> 01:55:27.075
I get on my knees
and I beg you to stay?

01:55:27.135 --> 01:55:29.118
You're on the phone
ordering pepperoncini pizza

01:55:29.151 --> 01:55:30.965
- Uh-huh.
- for your co-workers in accounting.

01:55:31.018 --> 01:55:34.080
Well, you...
you leave without looking at me.

01:55:34.503 --> 01:55:36.933
As if I didn't exist.

01:55:37.193 --> 01:55:38.447
Um...

01:55:39.236 --> 01:55:41.123
If you could pause for a second,

01:55:41.276 --> 01:55:43.346
you know,
Helena's distress would last longer

01:55:43.399 --> 01:55:46.266
when she's left alone in her office.

01:55:47.556 --> 01:55:50.543
Well, the way you're playing it,
um...

01:55:50.679 --> 01:55:54.496
the audience follows you out,
but instantly forgets about her, so...

01:55:54.623 --> 01:55:56.139
So...

01:55:56.606 --> 01:55:58.066
So what?

01:55:58.513 --> 01:56:00.796
Well, when I played Sigrid,
I...

01:56:00.866 --> 01:56:03.176
I held it longer.
I thought it was...

01:56:03.495 --> 01:56:06.803
more powerful.
I mean, it really played well.

01:56:07.075 --> 01:56:10.781
Well, no-one really gives a fuck
about Helena at that point, do they?

01:56:11.121 --> 01:56:12.975
I'm sorry. But, I mean,
it's pretty clear to me

01:56:13.008 --> 01:56:14.828
this poor woman's all washed up.

01:56:15.102 --> 01:56:17.345
I mean your character, right?
Not you.

01:56:17.399 --> 01:56:18.572
And...

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:21.245
When Sigrid leaves Helena's office,

01:56:21.370 --> 01:56:22.818
Helena's a wreck.

01:56:22.903 --> 01:56:25.406
And we get it.
You know, it time to move on.

01:56:25.593 --> 01:56:28.573
I think they want
what comes next.

01:56:28.974 --> 01:56:32.173
If you just held it,
a few seconds longer.

01:56:32.473 --> 01:56:35.033
It doesn't quite feel right for me,
Maria.

01:56:37.486 --> 01:56:38.995
You're right.

01:56:40.147 --> 01:56:41.661
Yeah.

01:56:42.346 --> 01:56:43.763
I, I um...

01:56:45.044 --> 01:56:48.550
I think I'm, I'm lost in my memories.

01:56:48.690 --> 01:56:51.110
You, you think you've
forgotten your old habits,

01:56:51.154 --> 01:56:53.613
but, they all...
they all come back.

01:56:53.731 --> 01:56:55.206
I have to break them.

01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:57.526
I guess you do.

01:57:22.741 --> 01:57:25.216
- Hi, come in.
- Hi.

01:57:25.823 --> 01:57:28.841
Thanks so much for seeing me tonight.
I really appreciate it.

01:57:29.048 --> 01:57:32.355
We're leaving early tomorrow morning
for a location scout in the Ukraine.

01:57:32.898 --> 01:57:35.392
That's where we're going to be
shooting our exteriors, mostly.

01:57:35.452 --> 01:57:37.332
So, I, I read your script.

01:57:37.666 --> 01:57:39.004
Yeah, well, um...

01:57:39.121 --> 01:57:42.500
I know we've never met, but,
I actually wrote it with you in mind.

01:57:42.906 --> 01:57:44.300
As a mutant?

01:57:44.657 --> 01:57:48.413
I'm trying to consider genetics
from a more human point of view.

01:57:49.607 --> 01:57:52.014
When I was reading it,
um...

01:57:52.425 --> 01:57:54.127
I imagined someone much younger.

01:57:54.202 --> 01:57:55.615
Maybe, me younger, actually.

01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:59.542
But, you were seeing me in movies
that were made years ago, I...

01:57:59.928 --> 01:58:01.095
I've changed.

01:58:01.147 --> 01:58:02.628
She has no age.

01:58:03.262 --> 01:58:05.711
Or else...
she's every age at once.

01:58:05.776 --> 01:58:07.196
Like all of us.

01:58:08.328 --> 01:58:10.041
Can I be frank?

01:58:11.737 --> 01:58:14.263
Maybe, because I'm
working with her, but...

01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:18.303
as I was reading it,
I... I kept thinking about Jo-Ann.

01:58:18.575 --> 01:58:20.098
Yeah, well...

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:24.105
personally, I never think
about Jo-Ann Ellis.

01:58:24.479 --> 01:58:26.250
You're wrong.
She's smart.

01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:27.720
And talented.

01:58:27.909 --> 01:58:29.190
She is modern.

01:58:29.251 --> 01:58:30.423
Just like your character.

01:58:30.476 --> 01:58:32.130
My character isn't modern.

01:58:32.242 --> 01:58:33.855
Notin in that way, anyway

01:58:33.942 --> 01:58:35.049
She's...

01:58:35.335 --> 01:58:36.769
outside of time.

01:58:36.878 --> 01:58:38.616
"Outside of time."

01:58:41.631 --> 01:58:44.596
I don't understand,
it's too abstract for me

01:58:44.723 --> 01:58:46.130
Sorry.

01:58:46.295 --> 01:58:48.923
I uh...
I don't like this era.

01:58:49.302 --> 01:58:50.855
You're wrong.
It's yours.

01:58:50.911 --> 01:58:53.155
Amen!
I didn't choose it.

01:58:53.618 --> 01:58:57.258
And if my era is Jo-Ann Ellis
and viral internet scandals,

01:58:57.328 --> 01:59:00.121
I think I'm entitled
to feel unrelated, aren't I?

01:59:01.368 --> 01:59:02.948
I mean, it's nothing against her.

01:59:02.996 --> 01:59:05.558
I guess I just assumed
you'd understand.

01:59:08.001 --> 01:59:09.608
Curtain in five minutes.

01:59:09.741 --> 01:59:12.228
- How's the house?
- Full.
