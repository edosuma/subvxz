WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.293
(siren wails)

00:05.339 --> 00:08.923
(Hall & Oates'
"You Make My Dreams" playing)

00:08.967 --> 00:10.298
J‘ What I want you've got J‘

00:10.344 --> 00:12.926
J‘ And it might be hard
to handle J‘

00:12.971 --> 00:14.586
J‘ But like the flame
that burns the candle J‘

00:14.640 --> 00:16.596
Nothin' but net.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.178
J‘ The candle feeds the flame J‘

00:18.227 --> 00:19.262
(hums along)

00:19.311 --> 00:20.642
J‘ Yeah, yeah J‘

00:20.687 --> 00:22.894
J‘ What I've got's full stock J‘

00:22.940 --> 00:24.805
(Luke) Andy, have you seen
my new blue tie?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.235
Yeah, second cabinet,
uh, top left drawer.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.858
Great.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.236
(humming)

00:31.281 --> 00:33.192
Uh, briefcase? Anywhere?

00:33.242 --> 00:34.607
Front door!

00:34.660 --> 00:38.369
J‘ Oh, oh, you make
my dreams come true J‘

00:38.413 --> 00:41.371
J‘ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah J‘

00:41.416 --> 00:45.000
J‘ Ooh, ooh,
well, well, well, you J‘

00:46.255 --> 00:47.085
J‘ Oh, yeah J‘

00:47.130 --> 00:50.588
J‘ You make my dreams come true J‘

00:50.634 --> 00:51.464
J‘ Mm—hmm, mm—hmm J‘

00:51.510 --> 00:52.920
J‘ Ooh, ooh, you, you,
oh, yeah J‘

00:52.970 --> 00:54.926
Okay, I know I had a few drinks
last night,

00:54.972 --> 00:57.839
but I could've sworn when I came home,
this place was full of boxes.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.927
I know. I unpacked this morning.
Want a tour?

00:59.977 --> 01:01.262
No, that's okay.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.142
lt'll just be like a scavenger hunt
every morning.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.143
It'll be great.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.018
What's wrong?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.900
I'm just scattered.
I got court this morning.

01:09.945 --> 01:12.027
What, you got butterflies, detective?

01:12.114 --> 01:14.196
Yeah, a little, before I testify.
It's no big deal.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.483
Mm—hmm.
Well, you look great.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.367
(both chuckle)

01:19.413 --> 01:21.495
— Yeah, so do you.
— You know what?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.781
— What?
— I'm happy.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.790
I know. Me, too.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.122
J‘ Ooh, ooh, you J‘

01:28.171 --> 01:30.833
J‘ Well, well, well, you J‘

01:30.882 --> 01:33.134
J‘ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh J‘

01:33.176 --> 01:35.792
J‘ You make my dreams
come true J‘

01:35.846 --> 01:38.007
J‘ You, you, you J‘

01:38.056 --> 01:39.466
J‘ Oh, yeah J‘

01:39.516 --> 01:42.474
(razor buzzing)

01:42.519 --> 01:46.011
— Ooh, I'm really hoping those aren't Dov's hands.
- (giggleS)

01:46.064 --> 01:48.976
— (Chris chuckles)
— You know what I'm hoping?

01:49.026 --> 01:51.733
Yeah, I keep telling you,
your voice will drop once puberty hits.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.767
Thanks,hon.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.439
Actually, I was hoping to use
my bathroom, in my apartment,

01:56.491 --> 01:58.527
because, you know,
I pay rent here.

01:58.577 --> 02:02.661
Sorry. Sorry, bro.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.664
Six weeks off the job.
It feels great to be back in action.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.574
(lowered voice) 80 how long
is Gail gonna be here, man?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.539
'Cause I didn't sign up
for another roommate.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.078
What are you talking about?
She's not a roommate.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.587
(Gail) Sweetie, don't put
your brush in my drawer.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.794
Your hair gets in my moisturizer,
and it's nasty.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.424
Sorry, babe.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.344
W—What?

02:19.431 --> 02:22.013
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm just gonna go take a pee...

02:22.643 --> 02:23.473
in your room.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.555
(horn honks, engine starts)

02:30.734 --> 02:31.769
What's that?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.558
A little housewarming card
for your new place.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.352
— Apparently, that's you and Luke.
— Aw!

02:35.405 --> 02:38.647
— Leo is in his purple phase.
— Very cute. Thank you.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.698
So how's the move going?
You settled?

02:40.744 --> 02:41.733
Uh,yeah.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.823
It's great. I actually have
everything unpacked.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.115
— What?
— Yeah.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.706
You? The girl who took six months
to hang pictures in her last place?

02:48.752 --> 02:50.834
I know.
|t's——|t's different now.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.087
It's like... it's like I know
where everything belongs.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.794
It's very good.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.799
ls that...Boyd?

02:58.845 --> 03:01.222
— Yeah.
— What is he doing here?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.134
Trying to get Swarek back
into Guns and Gangs,

03:03.183 --> 03:05.094
some kind of task force.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.808
(telephones ringing)

03:06.853 --> 03:09.435
McNally, Nash.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.434
— Sir.
— Uh, I need you over at Supernova.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.939
There's a concert going on there.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.192
1,000 wristbands went out,
and they only got room for 800.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.149
You're in charge, McNally.
Take the other rookies.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.109
Great. Who's playin'?

03:22.994 --> 03:24.734
Just another day at the office.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.619
(chuckles)

03:26.665 --> 03:28.155
(man) J‘ Yeah J‘
— I said, get down!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.823
Oh, I was looking for my friends.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.620
Yeah, you were standing
on top of my cruiser.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.535
I wasn't standing.
I was dancing.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.919
(handcuffs clicking)

03:34.965 --> 03:36.921
What are you on, genius?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.423
Um, natural high?

03:38.468 --> 03:43.087
Pfft. Natural high, my ass.
Let's go. Let's go!

03:43.181 --> 03:44.967
(crowd cheering)

03:45.684 --> 03:47.174
(man) Thank you.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.309
— (Traci) Okay, okay.
— Thank you.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.094
That's enough.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.976
Hey, Andy, what do you want me
to do with the rest of the stragglers?

03:54.192 --> 03:55.932
Uh, if they have wristbands,
get 'em in line.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.773
— If not, uh, put 'em on the sidewalk.
— Okay.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.858
Hey, so, uh,
I was just wondering——

04:00.907 --> 04:03.114
and it's totally cool with me
either way——

04:03.160 --> 04:06.118
but, uh, how long do you think
you'll be staying,

04:06.163 --> 04:08.279
you know, at the place?

04:08.331 --> 04:10.458
— Stop shoving. Play nice.
— Oh, you were wondering?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.616
Come on, people. If you're
hiding any alcohol or drugs,

04:12.669 --> 04:14.079
now's your chance to dump it.

04:14.129 --> 04:17.041
Have your pockets and purses
ready to be searched.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.044
— Better be water in that bottle.
— Officer Epstein.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.334
— Come on, people. Patience is a virtue.
— Dov?

04:22.387 --> 04:23.342
Dov Epstein?

04:23.388 --> 04:26.300
Mark? Mark Johnson.
How are you?

04:26.391 --> 04:29.258
Great, man. l—— Wow.
Not in a million years.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.347
— Dov.
— I haven't seen you since, uh...

04:31.396 --> 04:32.932
— your brother's birthday.
— Yeah.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.767
— The big 2—5.
— Where the——Where the...

04:34.816 --> 04:36.317
(both) barbecue caught on fire.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.974
Yeah, man. So how's he doing?
How is Adam?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.440
Great. He's great. Uh...

04:40.489 --> 04:42.946
Actually, l——l don't know
why I just said that.

04:42.991 --> 04:46.404
He died about four years ago,
so,yeah”.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.240
Uh, anyway, great to see you,
Mark. Okay.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.405
Yeah?

04:51.458 --> 04:54.165
Let's go, people.
Wait now, tweet later.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.831
All right, they're letting them in
ten at a time.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.245
We just need to keep
the rest of 'em calm.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.708
(siren whoops)

04:59.758 --> 05:03.342
This is what happens when you put
the word "free" in front of the word "concert."

05:03.386 --> 05:05.001
(Oliver) See, I love it.
That's free music.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.387
— That's culture to the masses.
— Oh!

05:07.432 --> 05:09.013
(man) Hey!

05:09.184 --> 05:11.095
Don't get any of your culture
on my car, buddy.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.008
(men) Aw!

05:12.062 --> 05:13.097
That's right.
Take it over there.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.556
What, are you practicing
your "bad cop" routine

05:14.606 --> 05:15.721
for Guns and Gangs?

05:15.774 --> 05:18.311
— I haven't decided yet.
— What's holding you back?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.475
You.

05:21.947 --> 05:22.936
Love working with you, McNally.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.729
Can't imagine my life
without you in it.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.697
Hey, you get to wear
all that hair gel again.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.652
— (Dov) We got a problem at the door.
— I'm on it.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.780
See you later.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.168
— What's up?
— 50 more——that's it.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.206
Then the doors are shutting for good.

05:43.552 --> 05:44.712
Great.
The crowd's gonna go nuts.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.217
Let's hope.
Maybe the riot squad

05:46.263 --> 05:48.219
will let me shoot someone
with a water cannon.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.254
What's wrong with you?

05:49.307 --> 05:52.265
I haven't driven over 60 on this job.
I need a little action.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.561
Fine. Then go take
the back of the line.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.809
They're definitely not getting in.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.602
(crowd shouting)

05:59.651 --> 06:01.812
All right, you guys, cool it.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.568
Any pushing or shoving,
and you're going home.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.195
Sorry to bother you, officer,
but Security told me

06:06.241 --> 06:08.232
that the line was over here,
and l was waiting over there,

06:08.285 --> 06:11.072
and I didn't want to leave,
just in case—— | feel ridiculous.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.786
My only job was to stand in line
and watch my friend's place,

06:13.957 --> 06:15.788
and now I'm not even
in that line.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.576
Look, I'm watching my roommate's spot.
We have wristbands.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.786
— Where's your friend?
— She's just around the corner.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.250
There's nothing I can do.
I mean, we're closing it off.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.295
Look, she went to go get
hot chocolate for me at Artie's.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.836
I got confused. The guy said
that it was to the right, and——

06:29.973 --> 06:31.258
You always do what
people tell you to do?

06:31.308 --> 06:32.343
Pretty much.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.259
Yeah, me, too.
Well, used to, anyway.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.928
Artie's is really good, by the way.
It takes forever, but——

06:38.064 --> 06:40.441
— You can't hurry love.
— That's true.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.602
All right, I'll make sure
I get you guys in.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.440
— Thank you. Seriously.
— Yeah.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.025
My roommate has been dying
to see this show.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.530
Yeah, no problem.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.112
Hey, boss.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.494
I'm gonna keep things moving,
if, uh, that's okay with you.

06:54.706 --> 06:55.912
Okay.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.075
Boyfriend?

07:00.128 --> 07:02.961
No. He's my tr——
well, was my training officer.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.122
He's cute.
I had a lab partner like that.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.131
— Acts all tough, but...
— Oh, yeah?

07:07.177 --> 07:08.838
(gunshot)

07:15.268 --> 07:19.136
(crowd screaming)

07:19.272 --> 07:21.103
(gunshot)

07:23.068 --> 07:24.774
(gunshot)

07:31.868 --> 07:34.701
(clamor)

07:36.915 --> 07:40.828
(screaming)

07:48.093 --> 07:49.879
Lie back! Lie back!

07:49.928 --> 07:52.795
(gasping)

07:56.184 --> 07:58.391
(inaudible)

07:58.436 --> 08:00.768
Hey, Swarek, call for EMS!

08:02.065 --> 08:03.180
1509. Shots fired.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.565
Supernova,
Queens Quay and Richardson.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.441
Two people shot. Officer down.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.854
Rush an ambulance right away.
Repeat——officer down.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.780
It's okay. It's all right.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.533
— Just let the air out.
-(gasp8)

08:16.997 --> 08:19.238
McNally, you're gonna be fine,
okay? You gotta stay down.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.246
Don't try to get up. All right?
Looks like the bullet

08:21.292 --> 08:23.374
just got stuck in your vest.
Just stay put.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.378
Just try to breathe, okay?
Andy. Andy, you're fine.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.664
You just got winded.
The bullet's stuck in your vest, okay?

08:28.717 --> 08:31.003
I'll be back.
I gotta be the boss right now.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.585
(groans)

08:34.889 --> 08:36.504
(multiple sirens)

08:36.558 --> 08:37.764
Oh.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.345
Nash, Diaz, get that thing.
Move it over there.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.434
— Get it out of the way.
— (Oliver) Right here. Right here.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.270
(Sam) Gunshot wound,
back of the head, the red jacket.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.184
Back of the head.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.024
That's all that I can see.
I got pressure on it.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.529
— I'm right here.
—(panﬂng)

08:55.410 --> 08:57.241
No, no, no, no, no, McNally.
McNally, sit back.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.160
Sit back, relax. It's okay, okay?

08:59.247 --> 09:00.453
I need you to stay put for a second.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.204
— We gotta get you checked out.
— I'm good. I'm fine.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.536
I know you are. I know you are.
But that blood, that bullet——

09:04.586 --> 09:06.952
You're evidence, okay?
Just breathe.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.212
Hey, Epstein, you're gonna
stay with the girl.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.378
Diaz, round up those people.
Get 'em over there.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.794
Don't let anybody go, all right?
Get 'em all over there.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.803
(Chris) Okay, everybody,
I need you all to step back.

09:17.849 --> 09:18.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:19.017 --> 09:19.847
What happened?!

09:19.893 --> 09:21.758
Uh, j——you can't go.
Just calm down.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.971
Just calm down.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.139
Kate! (panting)

09:24.189 --> 09:26.475
Calm down. Calm down. Just——

09:26.566 --> 09:28.978
— Just calm down.
— Oh, my God!

09:29.027 --> 09:30.483
(Oliver) All right, Epstein,

09:30.528 --> 09:32.484
you're gonna stay with her
until further notice.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.946
Okay? Write everything down——
time of arrival,

09:34.991 --> 09:37.778
time she goes into surgery,
all of her doctors' names,

09:37.827 --> 09:40.785
time that she's declared——
if she's declared.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.163
Okay? Stay on your phone.
I'm gonna go find her family.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.541
Wait. What's her name?

09:47.670 --> 09:50.582
Kate. I think her name is Kate.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.873
(sirens wailing)

09:52.926 --> 09:56.635
(EMS Tech) I need you to bag her for me.
CTAS One.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.591
l have a 22—year—old female
with a GSW to the head.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.178
GCS is a three.
ETA in five minutes.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.185
— What's happening?
— Anyone notifying her next of kin?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.846
— Oliver's working on it.
— Good.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.432
Shots came from over there.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.444
We got 3 casings from a .380.
One of them got trampled.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.695
No sign of the weapon.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.611
The victim's roommate
is headed to the station.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.242
Who's helping from Homicide?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.197
Oh, we're trying to reach Callaghan,

10:22.247 --> 10:23.783
but he's in court all day.
He's got his phone off.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.493
Not that this is a homicide.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.907
Looks like it's gonna be.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.700
Oh, and we are going
to treat it as such.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.993
Detective, thanks for coming.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.582
Heard most of it on the radio
on my way over.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.043
I'm glad to help.
Got me out of a sewer.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.879
Mm. Detective Jo Rosati.
She was trained at Homicide.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.884
— She works out of 27.
— Sam Swarek.

10:38.930 --> 10:39.885
Hey. Oliver Shaw.
How are you?

10:39.931 --> 10:41.592
Where's the rookie——
the one who got hit?

10:41.683 --> 10:43.264
Andy McNally.
She's right over there.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.095
Okay, then. Uh, I'm gonna
start with her.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.103
You guys look like you have
the rest of this under control.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.763
— (Frank) You did good, McNally.
— Frank.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.603
Jo, good to see you.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.438
McNally, this is, uh,
Detective Rosati.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.897
She's gonna ask you a few questions.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.111
That hurt? You okay?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.570
Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.654
Yeah, I bet.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.116
(police radio chatter)

11:06.875 --> 11:09.287
First of all, we're gonna
need your vest, okay?

11:09.335 --> 11:11.291
— Okay.
— Walter, right?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.749
It's okay.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.835
Relax. Relax.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.141
(Velcro ripping)

11:43.494 --> 11:45.746
— Okay. Let's have a look.
— Sorry?

11:45.788 --> 11:47.699
I'm serious. You're gonna
have to go to the hospital.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.659
Let's see how soon.

11:48.750 --> 11:52.117
— I'm fine, really.
— How many times have you said that today?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.289
A hundred.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.921
Well, you're probably gonna have
to say it about a hundred more,

11:56.966 --> 11:58.752
but good on ya.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.637
McNally, right?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.544
Yeah.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.634
You wanna tell me what happened?

12:05.683 --> 12:09.301
Uh...

12:09.354 --> 12:10.969
Yeah, I, uh...

12:11.022 --> 12:14.139
It's no rush, okay? No big deal.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.813
I got shot once.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.945
Vest, right up here.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.107
Puked for three days.
Didn't go to work for a month.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.697
(chuckles) l was——
I was the painkiller queen.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.204
I could tell you every soap opera plot
for 33 days.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.166
She was really nice.

12:34.212 --> 12:38.046
That girl was...very sweet.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.083
Anyway, |——| let her in,

12:42.136 --> 12:44.388
and, uh, I shouldn't have.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.637
|——| could've made her go home,
but |——| let her in.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.799
Sure. She was nice.
Of course you let her in.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.093
(sighs) So——so I did, and, um...

12:53.356 --> 12:55.472
we were just talking.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.641
She was behind me.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.152
We were talking about, um,
hot——hot chocolate,

13:01.197 --> 13:02.482
and...

13:05.451 --> 13:07.487
and then there was the sh——

13:07.537 --> 13:10.654
She——She got shot.
Oh, my God.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.164
You're doing great.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.915
— Okay?
— Oh.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.918
Hey, how you feeling?

13:21.968 --> 13:24.380
I'm fine.
Sam, that was really scary,

13:24.429 --> 13:26.761
and that hurt so bad.
I'm all right. I'm all right.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.139
It's just that I've already got
this bruise that's forming, and——

13:30.184 --> 13:31.014
What?

13:32.186 --> 13:34.097
Sam.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.476
(click)

13:37.525 --> 13:41.359
You gotta be kidding me.
You gotta get behind that truck.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.689
— Police. Get your hands up. Hands up.
— All right. All right.

13:45.742 --> 13:46.777
— You got any weapons on you?
— No.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.533
Turn around. Get down on the ground.
Down on the ground.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.366
(clank)

13:56.419 --> 13:59.252
You got a gun on you,
so help me God.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.458
Give me that.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.542
(handcuffs click)

14:11.768 --> 14:12.757
This is Swarek.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.347
I got a male party
in possession of a .380.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.933
I'm in a lot behind
the communications truck.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.566
(siren wails)

14:29.619 --> 14:31.826
(siren whoops)

14:34.916 --> 14:36.622
(suspect) Please.
I'm telling you the truth.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.079
It's not mine.
Someone must've left it there.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.743
You should be looking for them right now.

14:40.797 --> 14:44.039
l was just minding my own business,
going for a walk, and I found it, okay?

14:44.092 --> 14:48.176
Look, how many times do l have to tell you?
It was there on the sidewalk.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.506
|——|——| picked it up!

14:49.555 --> 14:51.841
That's probably enough times.
So you can shut up now.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.131
(suspect) I was gonna turn it in
to you guys. I swear.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.015
Is that him?

14:55.061 --> 14:59.225
Oscar Benson.
17, resides at 422 Beckett.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.893
Good. Let's get started.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.150
ldent's on the way over to check for GSR,
so don't let him wash his hands.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.151
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell is GSR?

15:06.197 --> 15:08.153
'Cause whatever it is, I don't have it.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.658
Oscar, it's okay. It's okay.
This is just standard procedure.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.033
We're gonna have you out
in no time, all right?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.118
Let's get you
a place to sit and, um,

15:15.164 --> 15:17.246
I'll find you, uh, something to drink
once we get in there.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.155
(door releases buzzes)

15:18.209 --> 15:19.324
Right this way.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.788
She just bought you guys
about 20 minutes...

15:21.838 --> 15:22.668
(door release buzzes)

15:22.713 --> 15:25.705
— before that kid starts thinking lawyer.
— She's good.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.840
Yeah, she is.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.135
The hospital is five minutes from here.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.721
You know, it's a very——
it's a very quick trip.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.056
You know that talk
you were gonna give me?

15:40.106 --> 15:41.721
W—What talk?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.480
My first day.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.602
You said that we were gonna go
and get a coffee, and...

15:47.655 --> 15:49.611
you were gonna give me
"the talk."

15:50.658 --> 15:52.273
That's, uh, that's a long time ago.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.617
Not really.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.160
Okay. Um...

16:01.210 --> 16:02.325
(clears throat)
l'm Oliver.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.209
Oliver Shaw.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.918
I'll be your training officer,
uh, until further notice.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.835
You don't touch anything in the car
until, uh, ltell you to.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.255
You don't write anything down
in your memo book until I tell you to.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.214
You don't talk to oth—other people.

16:17.268 --> 16:21.056
You look at me first.
You do as I say, not as, um, I do.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.056
I know you probably think right now
l'm——l'm being a bit of a hard—ass,

16:24.108 --> 16:25.609
but if it gets stressed out there,

16:25.651 --> 16:27.482
I will be, because my——
(voice breaks)

16:30.239 --> 16:32.230
my job is to keep you safe.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.987
This crest, uh, on my shoulder——

16:36.037 --> 16:38.949
this represents, you, McNally,
and we're...

16:38.998 --> 16:41.489
we're both going home today.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.504
(voice breaks)
That's a really good talk.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.918
(water running)

16:53.971 --> 16:56.007
(door opens)

16:56.057 --> 16:58.548
Andy? Andy.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.137
— Hey.
— Hey.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.259
It's okay. It's not mine. It's fine.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.769
— Where'd he get you?
— My ribs.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.770
It's fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.683
Ow. Ow, ow, ow.
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.852
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
No, it's okay. It's okay.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.770
Relax, okay? It's just sore.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.201
(door opens)

17:16.244 --> 17:18.326
McNally—— (chuckles) S—Sorry.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.861
Uh, the roommate wants——

17:23.167 --> 17:24.543
Detective Callaghan.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.825
Jo, what are you doing here?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.994
I'm just in to help.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.005
The roommate wants to talk to you.
She's in the D's office.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.335
— If you're up for it.
— Mm—hmm.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.626
(clears throat)
I hear we got the shooter.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.135
Yeah, looks like.
We found a kid with a gun.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.556
We're just about to talk to him.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.681
You don't have to do this.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.102
Just give 'em your statement.
l'll drive you home.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.850
Yeah, you know what?
I understand that.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.682
I'm fine, okay?

17:45.731 --> 17:48.188
I want to be here.
I need to be here.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.145
Yeah.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.573
We'd been in line for, like, an hour.
I mean, she was cold.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.152
She's always freezing.
So I went to get us some hot chocolate.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.985
And I shouldn't have gone.
I shouldn't have waited for it.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.026
I should've just come right back.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.909
Miranda, I get what you're saying,
but it wouldn't have changed anything.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.665
She didn't even want to come today.
Kate barely even listens to music.

18:06.711 --> 18:10.420
I mean, she listens to classical,
but she says it helps her study.

18:11.048 --> 18:11.878
Everything okay?

18:13.301 --> 18:14.131
Yeah.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.176
Yeah, we're just talking about Kate.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.178
All right.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.179
(door closes)

18:24.228 --> 18:25.388
(Jerry) Oscar Benson——no priors,

18:25.438 --> 18:26.473
but his brother's in a gang.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.478
— It doesn't mean he is.
— Doesn't mean he isn't.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.559
Think it's an initiation?

18:29.609 --> 18:33.522
Yeah, targeting a cop, in certain circles,
that might buy you some credibility.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.653
Okay, Luke, we got it.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.279
What, are you serious?

18:37.325 --> 18:40.158
Yeah, I called her.
You were in court. I needed backup.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.863
Yeah, but I'm here now,
and this guy shot a cop.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.368
A cop who happens to be
your girlfriend.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.279
I mean, unless she's not,
and you just like to make out

18:45.333 --> 18:46.618
with every cute officer
who takes a bullet.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.750
Uh, i—it's a conflict, okay?
You do live with her.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.581
Wow. Congratulations.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.997
Jerry, this is what I do, all right?
So I'm doing something.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.466
All right, your name goes on nothing,
and you have to stay away from this guy.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.297
— Fine.
— I'm gonna take first crack.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.928
Uh, all right with you?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.055
I'm not really up
for playing good cop.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.763
You guys used to
partner together, right?

19:06.812 --> 19:07.847
Yeah.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.888
— She ever play good cop?
— No.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.191
Right.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.359
(door release beeps, buzzes)

19:12.401 --> 19:15.985
So the girl you shot's
in critical condition.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.105
And guess what else.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.864
You also shot
a police officer, Oscar.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.275
I didn't shoot anyone.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.284
Can you just tell me
who you were aiming for,

19:24.330 --> 19:25.319
or should I ask your brother?

19:25.373 --> 19:26.533
My brother has nothing
to do with it.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.073
— So you did it all by yourself?
— That's not what I meant.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.118
I seriously doubt that you were
aiming for Kate Novatski,

19:32.171 --> 19:35.004
but I guess that's the problem
with shooting into a crowd.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.836
I saw a gun on the sidewalk.
I picked it up.

19:37.885 --> 19:38.715
Why didn't you come fonNard?

19:38.761 --> 19:41.924
I wanted to sell it. I could get
500 bucks for that thing.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.509
— You found it?
— Yeah, that's right.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.847
(siren wails)

19:48.896 --> 19:51.353
(Dov) They took her into surgery at 1443.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.229
(siren whoops)

19:52.274 --> 19:53.810
Doesn't look good.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.895
What else can I do?

19:55.945 --> 19:57.355
I'll call you back.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.986
Ms. Novatski.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.487
Where's Katie? Is she okay?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.114
She's in surgery right now.
I'll take you there.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.320
— You were with her?
— l was in the ambulance.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.907
Was she awake? Responsive?
How much blood did she lose?

20:06.956 --> 20:08.321
Ma'am, a doctor
will give you all that——

20:08.416 --> 20:09.656
Okay, look, please.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.710
I'm a nurse at Oakville General.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.083
I know how these things work.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.915
They're gonna shove me
into a waiting room,

20:14.964 --> 20:16.420
and they're not
gonna tell me anything

20:16.465 --> 20:19.298
until she's out of surgery,
so I need to know something.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.590
She was outside at a concert hall.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.879
There were shots fired.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.381
She got hit.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.768
Where? Where was she hit?

20:31.981 --> 20:33.346
It's a head injury.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.731
(stifling tears)

20:35.776 --> 20:38.233
Was there any brain activity?
(shuddenng)

20:38.279 --> 20:39.485
— Ms. Novatski——
— Oh!

20:39.530 --> 20:41.862
You need to talk to a doctor.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.401
(sobbing)

20:51.000 --> 20:54.413
Katie——she wanted to be a...

20:54.462 --> 20:55.622
an organ donor.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.162
It was really important to her.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.126
And she's young, and she's, uh...

21:01.927 --> 21:05.385
she's healthy,
so with a head wound,

21:05.431 --> 21:07.387
she's a very good candidate
to be a donor.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.344
So you need to help me.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.885
Okay.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.277
(helicopter hovering)

21:24.283 --> 21:25.443
(Chris) Somebody must've seen
something.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.484
We're just gonna jog your brains a bit.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.492
— (kid belches)
— (Gail) Charming.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.449
— Oh, don't judge me.
— Too late.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.911
All right, everyone take a seat,
over there.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.824
All right, since none of you ran
when the shots were fired,

21:35.878 --> 21:37.539
and we didn't find
any weapons on you,

21:37.588 --> 21:39.328
right now you're not suspects.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.623
But nobody is going home
until we know everything you know.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.212
Yeah, every little detail,

21:44.261 --> 21:46.422
and we really don't care
if it takes all night.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.383
I'll stay up all night with you.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.969
You'll stay up all night washing
the pepper spray out of your eyes

21:51.018 --> 21:53.179
— if don't let go of me right now.
— Ooh. (chuckles)

21:53.229 --> 21:55.060
All right,
who wants to go first?

21:55.105 --> 21:58.142
How about who's had less
than six drinks today?

21:59.902 --> 22:01.813
Lightweight, you're up.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.865
I got something,
but I don't think you're gonna like it.

22:15.918 --> 22:16.907
Try me.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.623
2:33 P.M.——the exact time
the gunshots were fired——

22:19.672 --> 22:22.379
— Oscar Benson was on his phone.
— With his gangbanging brother?

22:22.424 --> 22:24.164
No, with his God—fearing mother.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.504
They were on from 2:26 to 2:37 PM.

22:26.554 --> 22:29.011
11 minutes on the phone
with his mother.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.513
That'd be a record for me.
I'd definitely shoot somebody.

22:31.559 --> 22:32.844
I told you you weren't gonna like it.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.724
I like anything that gets us answers.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.385
So maybe he did find the gun.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.475
— At least we still got the weapon.
— Yeah. That was ballistics.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.483
The gun was jammed,
but the bullet we got out of Andy's vest

22:42.528 --> 22:43.563
is a match to Oscar's gun.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.567
The gun jammed?

22:44.613 --> 22:46.899
Yeah, that means shot number four
never made it out of the barrel.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.524
It's over. ljust got back
from the hospital.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.739
Kate Novatski's not gonna make it.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.198
I need a minute of your time.

22:55.499 --> 22:56.955
(Dov) Kate Novatski was pre—med.

22:57.001 --> 23:00.289
She wrote her college admissions essay
on organ donation.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.170
Donor card's complete.
It's the only thing her mother wants.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.295
We gotta find a way.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.718
Dov, as soon as they take her
off the respirator,

23:06.760 --> 23:08.045
it becomes a homicide.

23:08.095 --> 23:12.179
Chain of evidence, forensics, autopsy——
we need the body intact.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.964
She got shot in the head.
We know what happened.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.178
What do her lungs have to do with it?

23:15.227 --> 23:16.842
What the hell does her heart
have to do with it?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.854
D—Dov. | get it.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.309
You were there with the mother.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.188
|t's terrible.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.520
Yeah, it's terrible, but it doesn't
have to be meaningless,

23:24.570 --> 23:26.356
'cause right now that's all
it's ever gonna be.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.691
But for this woman,
for this family,

23:28.741 --> 23:31.574
we have a chance to do something
that will actually help 'em get through this,

23:31.619 --> 23:34.782
— so come on, please.
— (Jo clears throat) Fine.

23:34.830 --> 23:38.368
So we get a signed confession today,
before they take her off the respirator,

23:38.417 --> 23:40.032
before they do the autopsy.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.371
I'll make a case to the coroner,
and we take it from there.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.584
— No, seriously, let's work it out.
— Signed confession today, huh?

23:45.633 --> 23:48.340
Yeah. It's always good to have a goal.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.347
(chatter)

23:55.392 --> 23:57.599
— (man) Get out of here.
— (woman) What time is it?

23:59.229 --> 24:00.514
(Andy) Roommate literally laughed

24:00.564 --> 24:02.850
when I asked if Kate was involved
in anything illicit.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.017
Uh, she's an "A" student,
full scholarship.

24:06.070 --> 24:08.402
No——No boyfriend, no enemies.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.688
McNally, you gotta go home, okay?

24:10.741 --> 24:12.527
No, I don't need to go home, okay?
I don't want to go home.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.953
What am I gonna do?
You want me to watch some TV?

24:14.995 --> 24:16.451
Huh? You want me——
You want me to take a nap?

24:19.083 --> 24:24.043
Sam, if I'm gonna figure this thing out,
then I need to understand why...

24:24.088 --> 24:25.999
Understand?
What are you gonna understand?

24:26.048 --> 24:27.788
Shots were fired.
You were hit. She was hit.

24:27.841 --> 24:28.751
She's on a respirator.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.666
Kate. Okay?
It's not "she," it's Kate,

24:30.719 --> 24:31.799
and she was standing
right next to me,

24:31.845 --> 24:34.712
and——and |——| need to know
who she is.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.343
Okay.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.975
Take the roommate back to her residence
and talk to her on the way.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.100
Okay.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.313
(police radio chatter)

24:56.453 --> 24:58.114
I don't understand.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.575
If Kate's on a respirator,
then she's still alive.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.833
Not exactly. The machine's
keeping her breathing, but...

25:06.088 --> 25:06.998
I'm so sorry.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.753
You know what, I can take you
to the hospital right now

25:08.799 --> 25:09.629
if you want to see her.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.382
No, I don't want to go there.
Her mom is there.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.841
I'm the reason her daughter's dead
or——or almost dead

25:15.889 --> 25:17.971
or, like, about to die.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.884
I made her come with me.
I left her there, in line.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.767
— I let her in.
- (crying)

25:22.813 --> 25:24.428
I thought I was being nice.

25:25.649 --> 25:30.234
Listen, if Kate...
is really who you say she is,

25:30.279 --> 25:33.271
then——then...
this shot wasn't meant for her.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.859
It was an accident.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.483
It wasn't your fault.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.284
Yes, it was.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.285
Right?

25:41.331 --> 25:45.199
You sound like
my philosophy T.A.

25:45.252 --> 25:49.666
Always trying to make sense of everything
by saying, "Nothing makes sense."

25:49.715 --> 25:51.751
Doesn't change the fact
that she got shot

25:51.800 --> 25:54.416
and she's almost dead or...

25:57.473 --> 25:58.963
(Chris) All right, what about him
looked suspicious?

25:59.016 --> 26:00.722
I didn't say he looked suspicious.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.601
I said he was acting suspicious.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.226
A person isn't suspicious.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.763
Their behavior is.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.681
I'm doing my master's in criminology.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.188
Oh. Well, good for you.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.525
So what about his behavior
made him suspicious?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.405
He was sober.

26:17.451 --> 26:19.032
She was standing
right in front of me,

26:19.078 --> 26:20.409
and I saw the gun in her hand.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.865
Or——Or maybe it was a cell phone.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.530
It was one of those flip phones,
you know,

26:24.583 --> 26:26.494
so it kinda looked like
it could've been a gun.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.919
Anyone cough up anything yet?

26:27.961 --> 26:29.622
Uh, one guy threw up a corn dog.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.207
We got the day to solve this.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.417
— Okay.
— So let's solve it.

26:33.467 --> 26:34.923
Okay.

26:34.968 --> 26:39.928
If any of you tweeted, texted, blogged,
or uploaded any cell phone photos

26:39.973 --> 26:44.057
from outside Supernova,
step fonNard now.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.140
Larry, you're up.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.147
Give me your phone.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.361
It's a total violation of the Privacy Act.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.150
(Chris) Listen, you grad school poser,

27:02.204 --> 27:04.195
a 22—year—old girl
was murdered today,

27:04.248 --> 27:06.113
so if you have any photos
of the crime scene,

27:06.166 --> 27:07.121
you better show us,

27:07.167 --> 27:09.453
or I'll arrest your ass
for obstruction ofjustice.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.165
That was so hot.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.632
Let's see what you got.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.888
(Gail giggles)

27:26.270 --> 27:27.510
(beeps)

27:31.775 --> 27:33.276
You're still thinking gang, huh?

27:33.318 --> 27:34.933
I guess you're not.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.067
A gun like that is too valuable.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.024
Gangbanger's not gonna get rid of it
just 'cause it jammed.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.155
Well, it's not revenge.
It's not like the girl had any enemies.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.782
Well, if it ain't revenge
and it ain't money...

27:42.828 --> 27:44.693
|t's love.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.198
I don't know where it is.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.832
I mean, I've seen her
writing in a journal,

27:50.878 --> 27:52.834
but I don't know
where she keeps it.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.620
Okay. Is this her computer?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.038
Yeah.

27:56.091 --> 27:56.921
You know her password?

27:56.967 --> 27:58.798
No, I would never——| wouldn't ask.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.254
She was wearing that coat today.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.920
|t's mine. I gave it to her when I left.
She was freezing.

28:02.973 --> 28:04.133
You wear that a lot?

28:04.183 --> 28:05.593
Every day. I mean...

28:05.642 --> 28:09.351
not now, I guess.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.682
— We haven't talked about you.
— What about me?

28:11.732 --> 28:13.017
We talked about Kate.

28:13.066 --> 28:16.149
We know that she doesn't have
any ex—boyfriends, enemies.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.813
Well... (chuckles)
unlike my perfect roommate,

28:19.865 --> 28:22.026
there are probably about a million
people who hate my guts——

28:22.075 --> 28:25.317
a few ex—boyfriends,
a couple T.A.s,

28:25.370 --> 28:28.157
but it's not them that I care about.
It's my friend.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.618
Who was wearing your coat.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.086
(Gail) Are they printing?

28:36.673 --> 28:38.584
Yeah, they're printing.
They're printing it right now.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.794
l double—printed that last one.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.129
Did you send me that one
from that, uh, the one kid's camera?

28:42.179 --> 28:43.009
Yeah. Yeah.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.636
— You got it?
— I'm sending somebody over right now.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.423
(beep)

28:53.774 --> 28:54.684
(beep)

28:55.817 --> 28:58.308
(printer whirring)

29:00.530 --> 29:03.693
(Dov) We worked from tweets,
tweet pics, tweetdeck,

29:03.742 --> 29:06.609
hootsuite, facebook,
and cell phone photos.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.072
Not a clue
what you're talking about.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.612
All these pictures were taken moments
before the shots were fired.

29:10.666 --> 29:14.329
Now it's possible someone accidentally
took a picture of the shooter.

29:14.378 --> 29:17.040
All right, bring 'em in.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.165
(Dov) All right, everybody,
I want you to grab a marker

29:21.218 --> 29:22.754
and take a look
at these photographs.

29:22.803 --> 29:27.092
If you have seen any of these people
with this girl——

29:27.140 --> 29:30.724
the girl who got shot today——
I want you to circle their face.

29:30.769 --> 29:34.353
Now be sure.
If you're not sure, take a pass.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.491
You got something, Poindexter?

29:51.415 --> 29:54.282
— I know this guy from the Student Union.
— (Gail) So?

29:54.334 --> 29:58.953
So I saw him today and I tried to say hi,
but he just kept walking.

29:59.006 --> 30:02.624
— You ever seen him with this girl?
— No, I don't think so.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.257
But I've seen him with——with her.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.419
— That's Kate's roommate.
— We should call Andy.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.382
I'm gonna grab Detective Rosati.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.552
And the student becomes the master.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.557
I wouldn't go that far.

30:13.603 --> 30:14.888
(chuckles)

30:14.980 --> 30:17.938
(Traci) Guy's name is Adrian Sparks, 27,

30:17.983 --> 30:19.689
a grad student philosophy T.A.

30:19.735 --> 30:22.192
He lives at 1493 Spadina,
apartment 12.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.319
Just hold on.
It's Andy. She's on the line.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.948
McNally, can you ask Miranda
about a guy named Adrian Sparks?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.403
I'm not with Miranda right now.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.283
Where are you?

30:30.329 --> 30:32.240
I came to the Student Affairs Office.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.904
Miranda mentioned filing
some grievances.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.197
I thought I'd check it out.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.667
Hey, "Adrian Sparks" ring a bell?

30:38.712 --> 30:41.795
Yeah. Miranda made
a complaint against him——

30:41.840 --> 30:45.253
two complaints, actually.
It's not unusual.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.918
Favoritism, harassment,
stalking, ignoring,

30:47.971 --> 30:49.586
"He loves me, he hates me."

30:53.935 --> 30:55.436
Thank you.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.805
Okay, Adrian Sparks
was her philosophy T.A.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.389
They had a relationship.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.649
And she was the one to break it off.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.943
Harassment, a couple of threats,

31:04.988 --> 31:06.819
and she even had to get
her locks changed.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.980
We're working on that.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.989
Adrian was up
for assistant professor.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.900
We passed him over,
pending the investigation.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.329
— Thank you.
— You're welcome.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.328
— Good luck.
— Thanks.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.330
(lowered voice) Okay,
Kate was wearing Miranda's coat.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.116
|t's bright red, very distinctive.

31:19.169 --> 31:21.330
Miranda says she wears it every day.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.120
From a distance, the two of them
look very similar.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.583
Okay, McNally,
go and get Miranda.

31:24.633 --> 31:25.998
We're gonna head over there, all right?

31:26.051 --> 31:28.167
— (Andy) Sounds good.
— (Jo) All right, let's go.

31:36.353 --> 31:37.513
Miranda?

31:39.356 --> 31:40.516
Miranda, please open the door.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.476
| just need to talk to you for a minute.

31:44.486 --> 31:45.692
(Miranda, whimpering) No!

31:45.737 --> 31:47.978
— Miranda?
— (screams) Get off me!

31:48.031 --> 31:49.066
Hey, get off of her!

31:50.033 --> 31:50.863
You're Adrian.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.490
It's okay. It's all right.
I'm a friend of Miranda's.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.322
This is your ex—boyfriend,
the one you were telling me about.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.201
You told her about me?!

31:55.247 --> 31:56.236
— I didn't say anything!
— (Adrian) What did you tell her?!

31:56.289 --> 31:57.153
Miranda, shut up!

31:57.916 --> 31:59.076
Were you at the show today?

31:59.835 --> 32:00.665
No.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.879
No, you know what?
I don't have to do this.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.004
(gun clanks)
Yes, you do.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.005
So put your hands up
and turn around.

32:08.051 --> 32:11.669
Please help me! He wants to kill me!
He's gonna kill me!

32:11.721 --> 32:14.212
— Please help me! (sobbing)
— Stay here!

32:23.108 --> 32:25.224
(breathing hard)

32:29.906 --> 32:31.567
(panﬂng)

32:31.616 --> 32:33.402
(Andy) Adrian, stop!

32:35.537 --> 32:36.447
Stop!

32:44.588 --> 32:46.453
(siren wailing in distance)

32:46.506 --> 32:47.621
(gun clanks)

32:47.674 --> 32:49.255
Don't move!

32:52.012 --> 32:54.799
l said...don't move.

32:54.848 --> 32:57.055
(Adrian panting)

32:57.142 --> 33:00.100
Look around you, Adrian,
'cause this is it.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.429
— Turn around.
— Why?

33:04.483 --> 33:05.939
I wanna talk.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.942
What, you gonna talk me down
off the ledge? I love it.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.067
No.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.069
I thought that was your job.

33:12.115 --> 33:15.232
Not really, so if you wanna jump,
then do it.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.072
So then why are you pointing
a gun at me?

33:18.121 --> 33:19.361
I don't know.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.705
Doesn't really make
much sense, does it?

33:22.751 --> 33:24.707
So now we can talk——
really talk.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.960
Okay, fine. You go first.
Why are you doing this?

33:27.005 --> 33:30.372
Why not? It's what I wanted
in the first place.

33:30.425 --> 33:33.792
She'd be over. I'd be over.
The whole thing would be over.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.927
That didn't work out so well.

33:35.972 --> 33:39.464
Miranda's still here.
So are you.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.849
|t's pathetic!

33:42.187 --> 33:45.520
And now Kate Novatski is——is dead

33:45.565 --> 33:47.521
because she was cold.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.979
Yeah. You're so naive.
(whoosh)

33:50.028 --> 33:52.940
You're just like——
Aah! Uhh!

33:52.989 --> 33:55.526
Aah! Let go! No! Don't!

33:55.575 --> 33:59.693
| just wanted it to be done!
I just wanted to jump!

33:59.746 --> 34:01.202
Yeah, I don't care.

34:01.248 --> 34:02.579
(clicking)

34:02.624 --> 34:04.535
(Adrian) Let go of me!

34:04.584 --> 34:06.415
(sirens approaching)

34:06.461 --> 34:08.918
| just wanted it to be over!

34:10.298 --> 34:13.415
(chatter)

34:13.468 --> 34:15.333
(clank)

34:15.637 --> 34:17.298
(police radio chatter)

34:18.056 --> 34:22.516
(Alexander Cardinale's
"Sick of Dreaming" playing)

34:25.188 --> 34:26.803
He's up there.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.312
(Traci) Andy?

34:28.358 --> 34:31.566
Suspect's secure on the roof
of the student dorm.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.649
J‘l'mJ‘

34:35.156 --> 34:37.021
J‘ Fighting J‘
(bullets clatter)

34:37.075 --> 34:41.068
J‘ For a sign J‘
(clicking empty)

34:41.121 --> 34:43.487
(clicking repeatedly)

34:43.540 --> 34:45.906
Pretty sure it's empty.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.699
Uh, we got the guy——

34:47.752 --> 34:49.333
Kate Novatski's killer.

34:49.379 --> 34:50.494
Luke's in with him right now,

34:50.547 --> 34:53.334
so we'll probably have
a confession any minute.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.504
l was in charge today.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.550
l was in charge,
and she got shot.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.561
A girl got...shot.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.596
So did you.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.231
J‘ Hopeless and alone J‘

35:14.279 --> 35:17.396
— J‘ Am I breathing? J‘
— I thought if we caught the guy

35:17.449 --> 35:21.033
and maybe I could understand
why this happened,

35:21.077 --> 35:22.066
that I would feel better.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.244
I don't.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.741
Well, that's 'cause there's
nothing left for you to do.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.876
Everybody else——
they're gonna live their lives,

35:31.921 --> 35:35.880
eventually forget about this,
but... you can't.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.633
Dov, that's the most
depressing pep talk ever.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.130
Sorry.

35:41.848 --> 35:42.712
(Oliver) Epstein.

35:42.766 --> 35:45.098
Frank's waiting for you in his office.

35:45.894 --> 35:50.979
J‘ Stand up for my rights J‘

35:51.024 --> 35:53.231
I'm okay, really.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.601
You will be.

35:55.654 --> 36:00.273
J‘ The middle of a life J‘

36:00.325 --> 36:04.819
J‘ I fear is out of time J‘

36:04.871 --> 36:07.704
(Velcro rips)

36:10.627 --> 36:14.586
J‘ 'Cause I've been dreamin' J‘

36:14.631 --> 36:17.748
J‘ No more feelin' J‘

36:17.801 --> 36:23.592
J‘ Weightless as a stone J‘

36:23.640 --> 36:27.132
J‘ 'Cause nothing is
the same now J‘

36:30.271 --> 36:31.852
(Frank) l'm dealing with it now.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.184
— J‘ Nothing is the same now J‘
— Mm—hmm. Thank you.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.274
Peter McKee,
42 years old, 3 kids.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.609
He's been waiting for a heart transplant
almost two years.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.444
Epstein, don't, um...

36:47.497 --> 36:48.612
(keys jangle)

36:48.665 --> 36:50.155
Don't have an accident.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.709
(keys jangle)

36:56.005 --> 36:57.541
(chuckles)

37:03.596 --> 37:07.054
(siren wailing)
J‘ Am I breathing? J‘

37:07.100 --> 37:09.842
J‘ No more feelin' J‘

37:10.019 --> 37:16.936
J‘ Weightless as a stone J‘

37:16.985 --> 37:19.772
J‘ Nothing is the same now J‘

37:21.740 --> 37:25.198
I didn't even know Dov had a brother.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.196
Yeah. Adam.
He was a few years older.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.826
Was he sick?

37:28.997 --> 37:32.535
Uh... Dov doesn't like
to talk about it, so...

37:37.338 --> 37:38.919
He killed himself.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.047
You know, he...

37:42.093 --> 37:43.594
he hung himself.

37:43.636 --> 37:46.673
After that,
Dov's parents split for good.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.259
Wow. I...

37:50.143 --> 37:51.758
Um...

37:51.936 --> 37:54.803
Well, Chris, you know, you're, um...

37:54.856 --> 37:56.812
you know, you're back at work now,

37:56.858 --> 37:59.816
and——and you don't need me
to take care of you anymore,

37:59.861 --> 38:01.897
so I should probablyjust...

38:01.946 --> 38:03.652
move out, right?

38:03.990 --> 38:04.854
No.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.068
I like having you around.

38:26.888 --> 38:27.968
Luke?

38:28.014 --> 38:29.879
(Jo) Hey, I think we did good.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.382
From nothing to a signed
confession in six hours?

38:32.435 --> 38:34.266
We've never done that before.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.428
(Luke) We did it on that
Cardello chainsaw thing.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.516
(Jo) I don't think that counts.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.271
The chainsaw
was practically smoking.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.229
Remember the, uh, lvan Wallace fiasco?

38:42.278 --> 38:45.896
(laughs) Rebuilt the entire crime scene
at our apartment.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.985
I felt like we'd shacked up
with two chalk outlines.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.695
(Luke ) Well, we got
the guy in the end.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.609
(Jo) Well, I got the guy in the end.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.075
— (Luke) Really?
— (chuckles) Yeah, really.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.455
— Wait, do you remember it differently?
— Yeah. (laughs)

38:56.501 --> 38:59.243
J‘ So can you smell disaster? J‘

38:59.295 --> 39:03.459
J‘ Can you feel it in your bones? J‘

39:03.508 --> 39:05.920
Is there something gross in there?

39:06.094 --> 39:09.586
Oh. No. l was just thinking
about Andy.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.301
You know, like, what if
the bullet hadn't hit her vest?

39:12.350 --> 39:15.592
I mean, if it had hit, like,
6 inches higher——

39:15.770 --> 39:19.262
But it didn't.
We can't think like that.

39:19.399 --> 39:21.230
Anybody want a drink?

39:21.276 --> 39:24.063
(sighs) Apparently I'm buying, so...

39:25.697 --> 39:27.688
You were amazing today.

39:27.740 --> 39:28.900
Thanks.

39:29.742 --> 39:30.993
Doesn't mean
I want you as a roommate.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.650
Doesn't mean I care.

39:35.540 --> 39:36.620
I'm not taking time off.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.281
(Luke) Come on. It's all signed,
sealed confession.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.289
That never happens.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.121
Uh—huh. What about
the Cardello case?

39:44.549 --> 39:46.505
I heard you guys talking.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.135
— That was a long time ago.
— I know.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.221
(inhales, clears throat)

39:54.267 --> 39:56.303
Jo and l, we were partners
for three years.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.392
How long did you live together?

39:59.314 --> 40:00.679
Two and a half.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.974
Any regrets?

40:06.237 --> 40:07.647
Not one.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.525
Good.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.530
(laughter, chatter)

40:18.583 --> 40:20.699
(Traci) That's really funny. (laughs)

40:20.752 --> 40:21.992
— Hey.
— Hey.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.160
How's the bruise?

40:23.212 --> 40:24.167
(groans)

40:24.213 --> 40:25.669
— Ooh!
— Ooh!

40:25.715 --> 40:27.000
— Nice.
— Wow.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.506
(Dov) Anything broken?
You wanna sit down?

40:28.551 --> 40:31.008
(Andy) It looks worse than it is.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.294
(Dov) You had us worried, McNally.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.510
Nice working with you, detective.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.935
Oh, thanks. You, too.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.938
Looks like, uh, we might get
a chance to do it again.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.144
Oh, yeah?

40:42.190 --> 40:45.933
Always tricky switching teams
midseason, but, uh, duty calls.

40:46.194 --> 40:47.730
You're gonna stay at 15, huh?

40:48.613 --> 40:50.729
Well, you guys had an opening.
I put in for a transfer.

Hm.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.367

Uh, yeah. Haven't decided yet.

41:03.419 --> 41:04.579
Cheers.

41:04.629 --> 41:05.459
