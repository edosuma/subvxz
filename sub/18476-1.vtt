02:49.485 --> 02:51.771
No lights.

02:55.159 --> 02:58.987
- What do you think?
- Too quiet.

03:16.182 --> 03:18.385
Ma?

03:19.311 --> 03:22.764
- Pa?
- Happy birthday!

03:23.899 --> 03:27.637
- We couldn't resist. Even Pacer jumped.
- Where you been?

03:27.737 --> 03:31.141
It sure is a surprise,
since my birthday was last week.

03:31.241 --> 03:34.061
It's the first chance we had
to come out.

03:34.161 --> 03:36.313
Wash up. Supper will be out.

03:36.413 --> 03:39.651
You spent all day working.
We thought you'd never come.

03:39.751 --> 03:42.028
I'll take care of the horses. Eat up!

03:42.128 --> 03:44.080
We'll do that. Will, play us some music.

03:44.589 --> 03:46.708
How about this one?

03:56.561 --> 03:59.841
Hey, Dorothy, never mind those dishes.

03:59.941 --> 04:02.518
May I?

05:32.044 --> 05:34.154
- Supper's ready.
- Supper!

05:34.254 --> 05:37.492
- Sure is a fine-looking cake.
- I could eat a buffalo.

05:37.592 --> 05:39.877
You dance like one.

05:43.265 --> 05:46.962
Supper was great, Mrs. Burton.
Will and me always say...

05:47.062 --> 05:50.924
in cooking, no one would guess
you were different from...

05:51.024 --> 05:53.435
well, our ma or anybody else.

05:55.153 --> 05:59.350
I'm really proud you liked it, Tom.
Just a little more cake?

05:59.450 --> 06:02.319
No, ma'am.

06:04.872 --> 06:08.243
- What have we here?
- From me.

06:14.342 --> 06:16.794
Well, now, that...

06:18.514 --> 06:21.091
That sure is fine.

06:24.186 --> 06:26.305
What is it?

06:29.818 --> 06:32.095
Well, you hang it on the wall...

06:32.195 --> 06:34.389
and you put hot water in here.

06:34.489 --> 06:39.529
It's mostly for a man to shave by,
but you can comb your hair in it...

06:40.664 --> 06:42.441
or anything.

06:42.541 --> 06:43.992
It sure is fine.

06:44.418 --> 06:48.655
Roz is trying to civilize Clint
against the day he proposes.

06:48.755 --> 06:52.201
- If he gets around to it.
- You wear the britches...

06:52.301 --> 06:54.370
maybe you ought to propose.

06:54.470 --> 06:58.207
Pacer and me can look more presentable
when we come to the Crossing.

06:58.307 --> 07:00.753
I thank you all, for everything.

07:00.853 --> 07:04.883
- More coffee, anyone?
- I think we best be going.

07:04.983 --> 07:08.386
- We can make room here for anyone.
- No, thanks.

07:08.486 --> 07:11.181
We better go too, 10 miles can be long.

07:11.281 --> 07:14.518
Ten? Me and Roz
gotta go clear to the Crossing.

07:14.618 --> 07:17.438
The way she rides,
you'll make good time...

07:17.538 --> 07:19.732
if you can keep up with her.

07:19.832 --> 07:22.152
We'll ride along with you a ways.

07:22.252 --> 07:24.821
- Thank you, Mrs. Burton.
- Thank you, ma'am.

07:24.921 --> 07:26.998
- Good night, all.
- Good night.

07:38.187 --> 07:42.849
- See you at our wedding next month.
- You better see me before that.

07:44.152 --> 07:46.979
- Good night! Good night!
- Good night!

07:47.155 --> 07:48.723
Take good care of her.

07:48.823 --> 07:51.851
We better go or we won't get home
by morning.

07:51.951 --> 07:53.061
Thanks again.

07:53.161 --> 07:55.899
- Good night, Clint.
- Good night.

07:55.999 --> 07:58.410
- Good night, Roz.
- Night, Pacer.

08:01.505 --> 08:04.116
- What's that look for?
- Just thinking.

08:04.216 --> 08:09.255
With that fancy gadget to primp,
you'll be the prettiest fella in Texas.

08:29.370 --> 08:32.565
Will you be quiet?
No use waking everybody up.

08:32.664 --> 08:37.120
- I'll put up the rig.
- I'll get us some coffee.

09:03.116 --> 09:05.276
Quiet!

09:08.162 --> 09:09.940
Will, I tell you...

09:10.040 --> 09:13.744
you gotta stop all this fooling around.

09:14.295 --> 09:18.791
Making all this noise, I tell you,
the old man's gonna be...

10:06.520 --> 10:08.515
See him?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.941
Hunter?

10:43.604 --> 10:45.890
It's hot out there.

11:09.008 --> 11:12.120
Indian came up on that hill just now.

11:12.220 --> 11:14.881
Pacer says he's no hunter.

11:16.432 --> 11:18.969
Tie up the horses.

11:32.451 --> 11:36.739
- What is it, Sam?
- Not sure yet.

11:41.587 --> 11:45.373
He looked like he was trying
to figure something out.

11:45.549 --> 11:49.787
Nobody said anything about trouble
at the party the other night.

11:49.887 --> 11:51.589
No, sir.

11:51.931 --> 11:54.927
A lot of things can happen
in three days.

11:55.853 --> 12:00.133
Neddy, last time you saw your sister,
you hear anything?

12:00.233 --> 12:03.770
No, it was just about like always.

12:05.697 --> 12:08.024
Didn't you think so, Pacer?

12:21.507 --> 12:25.545
If trouble starts, who'll hit us first,
your folks or Ma's?

12:25.678 --> 12:30.041
Shame on you, Clint. It's more likely
neither will bother us.

12:30.141 --> 12:34.171
That ain't been my experience
about people in the middle.

12:34.271 --> 12:36.765
Maybe it's the new chief.

12:37.816 --> 12:40.970
- What new chief?
- The Kiowas got a new chief.

12:41.070 --> 12:43.848
- Since when?
- Maybe a month.

12:43.948 --> 12:48.479
- What about old Lame Crow?
- He's the old man of the tribe now.

12:48.579 --> 12:51.448
- How long you known this?
- Since it happened.

12:51.791 --> 12:56.079
- Don't you ever tell anybody anything?
- Not if they don't ask.

12:57.297 --> 13:00.534
Sometimes I think you're
more than half Indian.

13:00.634 --> 13:02.953
- He told me.
- Maybe you're the other half.

13:03.053 --> 13:07.258
Maybe your ma was Indian too
and didn't let me know it.

13:11.104 --> 13:13.347
One horse.

13:37.759 --> 13:42.048
- Are you my brother beyond the wall?
- Yes.

13:43.641 --> 13:47.045
Then why light go out
when friend come in peace?

13:47.145 --> 13:51.175
Why does a friend who comes in peace
wait until the sun is gone?

13:51.275 --> 13:53.844
Warrior ride when stars are alive.

13:53.944 --> 13:58.057
- Only against his enemies.
- In the world of white men...

13:58.157 --> 14:01.603
there are men who are not enemies
nor friends.

14:01.703 --> 14:05.565
- That is why I come to talk.
- Without giving your name?

14:05.665 --> 14:08.820
I am known from one end
of earth to the other.

14:08.920 --> 14:13.583
I have the strongest magic,
and I lead many, many warriors.

14:13.842 --> 14:16.495
I am Buffalo Horn.

14:16.595 --> 14:18.079
Buffalo Horn!

14:18.179 --> 14:22.426
We cannot be enemies to the Kiowas
without being enemies to ourselves.

14:22.560 --> 14:27.632
- Buffalo Horn should know that.
- I must see your eyes when you tell me.

14:27.732 --> 14:31.678
- Do you come out, or do I come in?
- Neither.

14:31.778 --> 14:35.608
We will talk to our brother
only in the sunlight.

14:47.046 --> 14:49.240
Your answer is honest.

14:49.340 --> 14:55.213
I will return again at a time
when the sun has killed the stars.

14:59.726 --> 15:02.714
- That was him.
- The new chief?

15:02.814 --> 15:05.884
- By himself?
- The others were over the hill.

15:05.984 --> 15:07.886
What do you think?

15:07.986 --> 15:12.274
He was carrying a war spear
with scalps on it.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.103
They wouldn't do anything to us.

15:15.203 --> 15:17.321
Maybe not.

15:17.497 --> 15:21.818
I wouldn't be too sure.
Know what some of them still call you?

15:21.918 --> 15:24.613
A trader said they got a name for you:

15:24.713 --> 15:28.410
"The thin woman
who deserted her own people."

15:28.510 --> 15:33.039
- After more than 20 years.
- I don't believe it.

15:33.139 --> 15:38.587
You boys better go to the Crossing
tomorrow for supplies and ammunition.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.674
That's fine. Fine.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.134
Not so fine.

15:43.234 --> 15:47.981
Won't be any time to dally with Roz.
I want you back by nightfall.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.439
You heard Pa,
no horsing around with Roz.

15:54.539 --> 15:56.942
What do you mean "horsing around"?

15:57.042 --> 15:59.903
- Ain't that what you're doing?
- No, it ain't.

16:00.003 --> 16:02.489
- You mean you mean it?
- What if I do?

16:02.589 --> 16:07.670
- With a gal that wears britches?
- What's wrong with that?

16:08.555 --> 16:10.415
Ain't nothing wrong, but...

16:10.515 --> 16:15.094
on second thought, you might
look pretty good with skirts on.

16:35.918 --> 16:38.413
Where is everybody?

16:57.568 --> 16:59.813
Anybody here?

17:04.701 --> 17:07.979
I've been thinking about you, Clint.

17:08.079 --> 17:12.318
- What's the matter, Angus?
- I've decided that you're my friend.

17:12.417 --> 17:16.490
But if your half-breed brother
comes here, I'll kill him!

17:16.589 --> 17:18.875
You're not gonna kill anybody.

17:22.638 --> 17:24.499
You!

17:24.598 --> 17:28.845
- Don't make me shoot you!
- Put it down, Angus, he means it!

17:29.938 --> 17:33.342
You better get out of here, both of you.

17:33.442 --> 17:36.720
- Are you both crazy?!
- No, we're not crazy.

17:36.820 --> 17:41.017
- Maybe just smarter than before.
- What are you talking about?

17:41.117 --> 17:44.939
The Kiowas hit the Howard place
the night of the party.

17:45.039 --> 17:49.402
Of the whole family, you know how much
they found in the ashes?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.696
One hand!

17:51.796 --> 17:54.908
- One of Dorothy's!
- Stop it!

17:55.008 --> 17:58.036
Now he's out making a coffin for her.

17:58.136 --> 18:01.164
Just to bury her hand in.

18:01.264 --> 18:03.334
Oh, my God.

18:03.434 --> 18:06.588
- They didn't hit your place, though.
- No.

18:06.688 --> 18:09.466
And you're right out the same way.

18:09.566 --> 18:10.676
I don't know...

18:10.776 --> 18:16.274
Pa's out with some men now.
They'll probably get killed too.

18:16.908 --> 18:20.145
But you don't have to worry about it.

18:20.245 --> 18:23.656
You'll always be safe from them!

18:31.382 --> 18:33.417
Let's go.

18:34.553 --> 18:38.633
No. Not until we get our supplies
and ammunition.

18:44.522 --> 18:47.017
Everything all right?

18:50.028 --> 18:52.439
Nothing's all right.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.901
What happened?

19:02.001 --> 19:05.162
Buffalo Horn hit the Howard place.

19:05.337 --> 19:08.408
- Killed them all.
- Dear God!

19:08.508 --> 19:13.505
If you hadn't tended them for fever,
they'd be dead four years ago.

19:16.475 --> 19:19.921
At these times I wonder
if we did the right thing.

19:20.021 --> 19:24.717
We did exactly the right thing.
I wish you wouldn't say such things.

19:24.817 --> 19:28.555
What does everybody want?
There's a million miles here...

19:28.655 --> 19:31.267
room for them, us, and a million more.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.103
It was their land, Sam.

19:33.203 --> 19:36.523
They don't like anybody else
taking part of it.

19:36.623 --> 19:37.899
It ain't anymore.

19:37.999 --> 19:42.905
We've worked this place for 20 years.
Nobody can tell me it ain't ours.

19:43.005 --> 19:46.325
Did those Pierces
say something about us?

19:46.425 --> 19:50.997
- Nothing much.
- Whatever they said, it's my fault...

19:51.097 --> 19:54.127
for being what I am.

19:54.227 --> 19:58.673
Neddy, now, you listen to me.
I'm speaking for the boys and me.

19:58.773 --> 20:01.635
We don't want to hear such things again.

20:01.735 --> 20:05.222
Whatever happens,
we'll stick together...

20:05.322 --> 20:07.266
and we'll not be swayed.

20:07.366 --> 20:11.855
If we have to live alone or become
a power unto ourselves...

20:11.955 --> 20:15.992
we'll resist whoever and whatever
comes against us.

20:51.249 --> 20:54.945
- Hey, Clint!
- Dred Pierce.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.332
We want to talk to you, Clint.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.794
They're not gonna do anything.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.653
What do you want, Dred?

21:31.753 --> 21:35.740
The Kiowas hit the Howard place Monday.
Wiped them out.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.869
We heard about it.
It's a terrible thing.

21:38.969 --> 21:41.122
How'd you hear about it?

21:41.222 --> 21:44.751
Me and Pacer was at the store
this morning.

21:44.851 --> 21:49.465
- The Indians didn't tell you about it?
- I don't want to hear that.

21:49.565 --> 21:53.594
There's gonna be trouble.
Indians coming from everywhere.

21:53.694 --> 21:56.722
More than a hundred already,
I've been told.

21:56.822 --> 22:00.560
We've been tracking the ones
that hit the Howard place...

22:00.660 --> 22:03.363
- ...but we lost them.
- Get to the point.

22:03.997 --> 22:09.028
The point is, if it comes to a showdown,
are you with us or not?

22:09.128 --> 22:12.741
- That's a foolish question.
- Not with your family.

22:12.841 --> 22:16.745
Watch yourself. You might
open your mouth once too often.

22:16.845 --> 22:20.375
- You gonna answer the question?
- It don't need an answer.

22:20.475 --> 22:22.544
- What did I tell you?
- It does.

22:22.644 --> 22:26.256
Yeah, I think we got
all the answers already...

22:26.356 --> 22:29.884
with all the reds and half-reds
in this family.

22:29.984 --> 22:31.812
Hold it!

22:33.573 --> 22:37.686
The first man who tries for his gun
will get a buffalo slug.

22:37.786 --> 22:40.155
Come back here, son.

22:41.707 --> 22:46.612
You making out that the death
of old friends don't mean anything to us?

22:46.712 --> 22:49.699
- That ain't the question.
- Then what is it?

22:49.799 --> 22:54.296
- Well, it's a question of loyalty.
- Go on.

22:55.097 --> 22:59.376
You know what I mean.
Your wife is Kiowa, full blood.

22:59.476 --> 23:03.799
Pacer's half Indian.
Clint's the only real white man.

23:03.899 --> 23:10.181
It's gonna be a bad war. Everybody
around will be in it sooner or later.

23:10.281 --> 23:14.811
Are you gonna give Clint the chance
to consider the situation...

23:14.911 --> 23:18.773
- ...and decide what he ought to do?
- I don't need to consider.

23:18.873 --> 23:21.568
I told you we wouldn't get
straight answers.

23:21.668 --> 23:26.073
Buffalo Horn's our enemy
because of what he done to the Howards.

23:26.173 --> 23:28.285
He broke God's and man's laws.

23:28.385 --> 23:31.747
You know my family is ready
to fight our enemies.

23:31.847 --> 23:36.260
- Is that straight enough for you?
- I suppose you mean us too.

23:36.728 --> 23:42.342
That's up to you, Ben. We're friends
with anyone who's friendly with us.

23:42.442 --> 23:44.719
This visit ain't been friendly.

23:44.819 --> 23:49.733
Who wants to be friendly with a man
with a Kiowa squaw?

23:50.242 --> 23:53.438
Don't shoot! Nobody else shoot!

23:53.538 --> 23:55.899
- How is it?
- I'm bad hurt.

23:55.999 --> 24:01.197
- Lucky it wasn't me, you'd be dead.
- Bring him in. Maybe I can help.

24:01.297 --> 24:06.452
- I wouldn't let an Indian touch me.
- We got about all the answer we need.

24:06.552 --> 24:09.965
Then get going, all of you!

24:22.738 --> 24:24.974
You shoot too quick?

24:25.074 --> 24:30.196
No, I pulled off. I couldn't
just kill him, just like that.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.703
- What are they doing?
- Stampeding the cattle.

24:43.803 --> 24:46.038
- No use now!
- There's a couple.

24:46.139 --> 24:52.179
- Stop him, Clint.
- Pacer! Pa don't want you to.

24:53.064 --> 24:57.593
- Why not go after them?
- Because we'd be too few out there.

24:57.693 --> 25:00.187
Harm's done, anyway.

25:03.158 --> 25:05.485
Come on in.

25:06.537 --> 25:10.866
These are what we call
our white friends, I suppose.

25:12.001 --> 25:17.074
It may take more than a day, so don't
worry if we don't get back tonight.

25:17.174 --> 25:19.618
Stay close, keep everything locked.

25:19.718 --> 25:22.956
What if the fellas
from the Crossing come back?

25:23.056 --> 25:27.802
Think about Ma. Take care of her
regardless of who comes.

25:51.129 --> 25:53.164
Pacer.

25:55.009 --> 25:56.877
Watch up yonder.

25:59.555 --> 26:02.791
- What was it?
- For a second it looked like...

26:02.891 --> 26:05.879
like a man on foot, way off, up there.

26:05.980 --> 26:09.509
- Didn't you see anything?
- No.

26:09.609 --> 26:14.430
If it's somebody, he might need help.
Maybe you should go see.

26:14.530 --> 26:19.361
I don't see anything, Ma.
Pa said stay near the house.

26:23.665 --> 26:28.029
You think about what Pierce said,
about joining his crowd?

26:28.129 --> 26:32.618
- I haven't paid it any mind.
- Maybe you'd better think about it.

26:32.718 --> 26:36.831
I didn't aim to, but I brought you
boys to a bad situation.

26:36.931 --> 26:42.170
It didn't matter when you were young,
but now as men, you'll think about it.

26:42.270 --> 26:47.593
So if you want to ride with Dred
and them, I'll try to understand.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.637
You'll go with my blessing.

26:49.737 --> 26:53.015
You already said it.
There's only one side for us...

26:53.115 --> 26:56.151
you, and Ma, and Pacer and me.

26:58.330 --> 27:00.608
Oh, no.

27:00.708 --> 27:04.112
- They shot them!
- I should've killed Matt Holcum.

27:04.212 --> 27:06.656
We should've cut them all down.

27:06.756 --> 27:08.659
They're worse than Indians!

27:08.759 --> 27:13.122
An Indian will rob you blind,
but this is waste and meanness.

27:13.222 --> 27:15.382
It's done.

27:15.849 --> 27:18.885
Let's find the rest of the herd.

27:42.213 --> 27:46.284
Pacer, you ought to get
a little sleep at least.

27:46.384 --> 27:51.373
- I'll be all right. Go on back to bed.
- Good night, Pacer.

27:51.473 --> 27:53.509
Ma.

27:54.310 --> 27:57.221
- What is it?
- I don't know yet.

28:01.359 --> 28:03.187
Strangers.

28:04.238 --> 28:05.981
Hey, in there!

28:06.991 --> 28:08.525
Yeah?

28:09.159 --> 28:11.570
Can you maybe spare a bite?

28:12.246 --> 28:15.108
- Who are you?
- We're trappers.

28:15.208 --> 28:19.280
- We got chased out of the hills.
- Too much trouble brewing.

28:19.380 --> 28:22.909
We're getting out of this country.
We're half-starved.

28:23.009 --> 28:25.087
Let them in.

28:25.929 --> 28:29.341
- I ain't sure.
- We can't turn them away hungry.

28:41.905 --> 28:44.607
Sure mighty neighborly of you.

28:46.786 --> 28:49.523
- Hey, you Indians?
- Yeah.

28:49.623 --> 28:52.776
- You two work here?
- This is our home.

28:52.876 --> 28:57.990
How do you like that?
Indians living in a house like this.

28:58.090 --> 29:02.119
- How about getting us supper, red boy?
- I'm fixing something.

29:02.219 --> 29:05.047
Is that your ma?

29:06.600 --> 29:10.087
- What are you making, honey?
- Meat stew.

29:10.187 --> 29:14.342
I have to warm it up a little.
Get me another log, Pacer.

29:14.442 --> 29:17.137
You'll sit down at the table.

29:17.237 --> 29:21.350
- Didn't you hear your ma, red boy?
- What's the matter?

29:21.450 --> 29:25.362
- Nothing.
- Then hurry up and get it.

29:38.845 --> 29:42.916
Where's the heap big chief?

29:43.016 --> 29:46.336
Your husband, or whoever he is.

29:46.436 --> 29:50.508
He'll be back soon.
But he's not a chief, he's white.

29:50.608 --> 29:53.511
Oh? That's it, huh?

29:53.611 --> 29:56.147
You like them white?

29:56.406 --> 29:58.725
I like my husband.

29:58.825 --> 30:03.939
That ain't all, is it? One man
for a good-looking squaw like you?

30:04.039 --> 30:06.451
Please.

30:06.918 --> 30:10.071
Come on. I know you red babies.

30:10.171 --> 30:12.950
- Please, mister.
- What are you afraid of?

30:13.050 --> 30:15.786
- Joe will watch the door.
- Let me go.

30:15.886 --> 30:18.706
All right, I tell you what.

30:18.806 --> 30:24.262
You just give me one little kiss,
and see if you don't want a few more.

30:31.403 --> 30:35.233
Pa and Clint are back.
They'll be in, in a minute.

30:35.993 --> 30:40.739
These men can't wait.
They're leaving now.

30:59.477 --> 31:01.638
Pacer.

31:12.658 --> 31:15.145
If it hadn't been for that kid...

31:15.245 --> 31:18.532
All right. Get off your horses.

31:19.291 --> 31:21.952
Did you hear what I said?

31:23.712 --> 31:27.835
Drop your gun belts.
Come on, hurry it up.

31:30.512 --> 31:34.166
If you're aiming to rob us,
you're wasting your time.

31:34.266 --> 31:35.919
We ain't got anything.

31:36.019 --> 31:39.089
I might kill you,
but I ain't gonna rob you.

31:39.189 --> 31:45.061
- We've had enough trouble with Indians.
- All he asked for was a little kiss.

31:46.489 --> 31:49.275
I'm telling you, now, boy.

31:56.041 --> 31:59.370
That's a little better, red boy.

32:31.248 --> 32:33.783
Please, I'm done!

32:34.501 --> 32:36.494
Stop!

33:11.333 --> 33:14.080
- Yes?
- It's me!

33:20.470 --> 33:22.080
Pacer!

33:22.180 --> 33:26.668
- I wanted to make sure they went away.
- That's all?

33:26.768 --> 33:29.262
You're bleeding.

33:29.813 --> 33:32.599
I tripped in the dark.

33:34.444 --> 33:38.649
You landed awful hard on your knuckles.

33:58.054 --> 34:02.216
Inside, Ma! Inside, come on!

34:26.168 --> 34:27.904
Two Moons is with them.

34:28.004 --> 34:31.166
- Kiowa Pacer!
- Yes?

34:35.929 --> 34:41.052
It is a new time. The sun has killed
the stars. Come out and talk!

34:41.228 --> 34:44.339
I will not come out among your warriors.

34:44.438 --> 34:49.219
I'm your friend. Nothing will happen
to you if you come out.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.608
Nothing will happen to me
if I stay behind my walls either.

35:02.085 --> 35:04.996
Now you come out?

35:10.136 --> 35:14.381
Wait a minute!
Give me your rifle. Put this on!

35:21.023 --> 35:24.184
If anything happens, bolt the door.

35:48.136 --> 35:54.086
This is how men talk, with their eyes
seeing if words are true or false.

35:54.186 --> 35:58.965
- You talk, I will listen.
- I need many, many more warriors.

35:59.065 --> 36:05.064
The white man is thick from
the rising sun to the setting sun.

36:05.281 --> 36:08.309
We have no place to go.

36:08.409 --> 36:13.572
We have to fight, or we die.
You understand?

36:18.171 --> 36:22.700
This is the great war our gods
have spoken to us in our dreams.

36:22.800 --> 36:28.632
Soon we will have the power
to take whole white villages!

36:29.391 --> 36:33.637
You say you are not our enemy.
Then you must be friend.

36:34.396 --> 36:37.259
Will you ride with us?

36:37.359 --> 36:41.980
You have many warriors.
One more warrior is not important.

36:42.739 --> 36:45.894
You are of the greatest
importance to me.

36:45.994 --> 36:52.109
For if a half-white leaves his father's
people for his mother's people...

36:52.209 --> 36:55.404
it'll make the strongest magic
I can have.

36:55.504 --> 36:57.498
If I say no?

37:00.927 --> 37:04.831
Not being my friend,
you will be my enemy.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.626
And this house and all in it will die!

37:07.726 --> 37:11.181
For I will not have
a half-Kiowa against me!

37:11.398 --> 37:16.603
- Come in here a minute, Pacer.
- I must talk to my mother.

37:26.372 --> 37:29.318
- We'll go back with him.
- Back where?

37:29.418 --> 37:33.447
To their camp.
I'll talk this over with Lame Crow.

37:33.547 --> 37:38.369
- You mean, about me?
- The whole thing, war and everything.

37:38.469 --> 37:41.582
Lame Crow's my uncle,
maybe he can stop it.

37:41.682 --> 37:44.877
They wouldn't care about what you said.

37:44.977 --> 37:46.962
I'll try it anyway.

37:47.062 --> 37:52.093
I can't see all these people being
killed without trying to stop it.

37:52.193 --> 37:56.806
- Write Pa where we're going.
- Ma, wait and talk to Pa first.

37:56.906 --> 38:02.021
No, he'd lock me up or something.
Tell him we'll be back by midnight.

38:02.121 --> 38:05.825
I can't let you do it, Ma.
It's too dangerous.

38:07.294 --> 38:12.575
But they wouldn't hurt us, Pacer.
They're our own people.

38:12.675 --> 38:17.413
They ain't my people. Truthfully,
I don't know who's my people.

38:17.513 --> 38:19.840
Maybe I ain't got any.

38:20.641 --> 38:24.505
I couldn't ride with those guys,
burning and killing.

38:24.605 --> 38:26.215
I know, Pacer.

38:26.315 --> 38:30.971
- That's what he's asking me to do, Ma!
- You can say no.

38:31.071 --> 38:35.935
I can say no here. What if he
asks me there, in the middle of them?

38:36.035 --> 38:39.730
But he wouldn't do that.
You'd be his guest.

38:39.830 --> 38:44.152
You haven't seen his eyes
when he talks about this war.

38:44.252 --> 38:48.949
He'll ask me, all right, guest or not.
And if I don't say yes...

38:49.049 --> 38:54.839
Then I don't think
you ought to go either. I'll go alone.

39:08.446 --> 39:13.893
This is so important, my mother thinks
we should talk to her family.

39:13.993 --> 39:18.524
- You'll come to the safety of our camp?
- Yes.

39:18.624 --> 39:21.744
Your mother is wise.

39:22.169 --> 39:25.081
We will ride with you.

39:48.866 --> 39:53.647
- What do you think about this war?
- Buffalo Horn say it got to be.

39:53.747 --> 39:58.661
He say if we wait any longer
it will be too late.

39:59.170 --> 40:03.158
It must be harder for you,
half white, half Indian.

40:03.258 --> 40:05.202
It is not easy.

40:05.302 --> 40:11.175
- White men treat you well?
- My father and brother do.

40:42.677 --> 40:46.257
If anything starts,
take my horse and ride out.

41:06.245 --> 41:09.365
Welcome, N'edd'ee-pahs.

41:10.876 --> 41:16.700
- I come to you with love, and gifts.
- Show me.

41:16.800 --> 41:21.121
Take her to Lame Crow.
She wants to talk to him.

41:21.221 --> 41:23.131
Come.

41:38.366 --> 41:40.234
Sit.

41:41.494 --> 41:44.313
Pacer is brother.

41:44.413 --> 41:48.902
We make him welcome. Speak, anyone.

41:49.002 --> 41:55.584
Kiowa Pacer, is true Earth round
like ball? White man live all sides?

41:55.844 --> 41:57.746
That is true.

41:57.846 --> 42:01.507
Tell me, why man on bottom not fall off?

42:02.892 --> 42:06.723
I've never been there. Maybe they do.

42:18.703 --> 42:24.233
"Dear Pa and Clint,
Ma took a notion to see her sister.

42:24.333 --> 42:30.200
I told her not, but you know Ma.
I think we will be back by midnight.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.828
I tried to make her not go,
but you know Ma.

42:33.928 --> 42:37.499
Respectfully yours, Pacer."

42:37.599 --> 42:41.253
Now, why do you reckon
she wanted to do that?

42:41.353 --> 42:44.890
- We'll go after them.
- Wait a minute.

42:45.858 --> 42:49.095
Ten o'clock. We'd better wait
the two hours...

42:49.195 --> 42:51.973
rather than miss them in the dark.

42:52.073 --> 42:55.727
Then we'll go after them
with the scatterguns.

42:55.827 --> 43:01.827
If they do anything to Ma and Pacer,
scatterguns can make an awful mess.

43:24.152 --> 43:27.397
Many moon back, I see white man book.

43:27.656 --> 43:32.353
In it was great mountain lion
with stripe painted on fur.

43:32.453 --> 43:38.742
Speak me this, Kiowa Pacer. Why white
man paint stripe on mountain lion?

43:38.918 --> 43:41.988
That was a great animal called a tiger.

43:42.088 --> 43:44.908
They didn't paint the stripes on it.

43:45.008 --> 43:49.663
Could be then,
this great tiger paint on own stripes.

43:49.763 --> 43:54.136
Which make tiger brother
to my Kiowa warriors.

44:05.323 --> 44:09.185
We didn't speak about the thing
I came to talk about.

44:09.285 --> 44:13.857
Yes. My spirit reached out
and touched you...

44:13.957 --> 44:18.330
and I knew it was not good
to speak of it now.

44:19.339 --> 44:24.286
It will be hard for you to come back
to us. You are not yet ready.

44:24.386 --> 44:29.083
If I asked you now to say yes or no,
you might say no.

44:29.183 --> 44:32.295
Or you might lie to me and say yes.

44:32.395 --> 44:36.808
But I would know that you lie,
and I'd have to kill you.

44:37.317 --> 44:40.095
We are close in spirit now.

44:40.195 --> 44:42.973
I want you to come back to your people.

44:43.074 --> 44:46.645
- You think about it?
- I will.

44:46.745 --> 44:50.775
Think of this too. Whose land is this?

44:50.875 --> 44:54.195
Who has lived here
since the beginning of time?

44:54.295 --> 44:58.658
Do we go out to take their land?
No, they come against us!

44:58.758 --> 45:02.037
Forever cutting deeper into our land.

45:02.137 --> 45:06.508
Forever taking! Forever pushing!

45:09.020 --> 45:13.183
We will speak of it again soon.

45:14.860 --> 45:20.483
I hope your blood will be one with ours.

45:32.004 --> 45:34.039
Two Moons.

45:35.132 --> 45:37.794
Take me to Lame Crow.

45:41.349 --> 45:45.094
I will ride part of the way
back with you.

45:46.938 --> 45:49.056
Ready, Ma?

45:52.444 --> 45:55.939
I go in goodwill.

46:22.394 --> 46:24.930
It's all right, Ma.

46:26.857 --> 46:30.846
They wouldn't even listen to me.
None of them.

46:30.946 --> 46:36.311
They said I wasn't Kiowa anymore,
nor white either.

46:36.411 --> 46:40.648
My own sister said I was nothing!

46:40.748 --> 46:43.910
You done the best you could, Ma.

47:00.146 --> 47:01.972
Kill them!

47:18.374 --> 47:20.201
Will!

47:20.501 --> 47:22.913
It's Will Howard!

47:25.466 --> 47:27.293
Ma?

47:34.017 --> 47:35.794
Ma?

47:35.894 --> 47:40.265
- Pacer, I'm dying.
- No, Ma.

47:41.066 --> 47:47.056
I can feel, close to me,
the flaming star of death.

47:47.156 --> 47:51.654
Stop talking like that, Ma.
I don't think it's too bad.

47:52.622 --> 47:55.241
It'll be all right.

47:57.877 --> 48:00.914
- Who is it?
- It's me and Clint, Pacer!

48:01.089 --> 48:03.583
Ma is hurt!

48:10.600 --> 48:13.962
- It was Will Howard that done it.
- Will Howard?

48:14.062 --> 48:17.299
- Two Moons tried to stop him.
- Honey?

48:17.399 --> 48:19.635
Neddy, honey!

48:19.735 --> 48:22.772
Let's put her in the back.

48:31.958 --> 48:36.070
- Clint.
- We're all here. You'll be all right.

48:36.170 --> 48:39.248
We're going home, honey.

48:52.773 --> 48:56.351
That's all we can do for her now.

49:07.664 --> 49:12.153
- Tell me what happened.
- Will jumped up and started shooting.

49:12.253 --> 49:15.407
He must have been wandering
since the raid.

49:15.507 --> 49:20.579
- You think he knew what he was doing?
- He thought he saw three Indians.

49:20.679 --> 49:23.415
He must have been crazy with pain...

49:23.515 --> 49:27.420
after what happened to his family.

49:27.520 --> 49:32.342
- You making excuses for him?
- Had you not killed him, we would have.

49:32.442 --> 49:35.512
- We need a doctor.
- I'll get Doc Phillips.

49:35.612 --> 49:38.483
What if he don't want to come?

49:38.700 --> 49:40.936
He won't have a choice.

49:41.036 --> 49:43.813
Those folks are mad. I'd better go too.

49:43.913 --> 49:46.943
Try not to have any trouble,
but get him.

49:47.043 --> 49:49.536
We'll get him.

50:00.557 --> 50:03.511
Dred, they're coming!

50:09.610 --> 50:11.520
They're here, Ben!

50:47.276 --> 50:52.057
- Don't worry about shooting our cattle.
- Don't come no closer!

50:52.157 --> 50:55.562
We don't want
to see you boys here again.

50:55.662 --> 50:57.647
We need Doc Phillips.

50:57.747 --> 51:02.820
You don't need him any more than we do.
You know what I mean!

51:02.920 --> 51:05.072
We need him right away!

51:05.172 --> 51:07.074
- What's wrong?
- Ma's hurt.

51:07.174 --> 51:08.367
Go inside.

51:08.467 --> 51:11.287
- What happened?
- Will Howard shot her.

51:11.387 --> 51:17.135
- What? Will Howard's dead.
- He's dead now, but he shot Ma first.

51:17.811 --> 51:21.590
- Now, if he's just dead, who killed him?
- Me.

51:21.690 --> 51:25.729
Hold it! Everybody hold it!
Just keep them covered!

51:28.699 --> 51:31.226
If shooting starts, I'll kill you.

51:31.326 --> 51:36.574
Will Howard's been dead for nearly
a week and everybody knows it.

51:37.125 --> 51:41.746
Will wasn't far from dead,
but he was alive enough to shoot Ma.

51:41.963 --> 51:44.366
Pa, we gotta help her!

51:44.466 --> 51:47.920
He's just lying, honey.
The both of them!

51:50.515 --> 51:53.801
Hey, doc! Doc Phillips!

51:54.562 --> 52:00.100
All right, come out, doc!
Ain't nobody gonna do anything to you.

52:04.822 --> 52:07.609
Ma needs you, doc.

52:10.537 --> 52:15.986
- You know I want to help her, but...
- It's a free country, doc.

52:16.086 --> 52:19.615
If you can't decide,
maybe we can help you.

52:19.715 --> 52:24.912
- Let's vote, everybody! I vote no!
- And I go along with Dred!

52:25.012 --> 52:27.958
- I say don't go!
- I say no!

52:28.058 --> 52:32.053
- I vote doc don't go!
- I speak the same!

52:32.353 --> 52:39.687
I say no too. But I can give you some
advice: Get a medicine man for her.

52:40.112 --> 52:43.733
- Cover me, I'll get him.
- Two dead men are worth nothing.

52:44.534 --> 52:47.862
You see how it is, Clint.

52:49.957 --> 52:51.867
- Clint!
- Come on.

52:59.885 --> 53:04.548
- What are you doing?
- I got an idea. Don't look back!

53:15.152 --> 53:18.472
You saw that kid playing back
at doc's house?

53:18.572 --> 53:20.726
I can do it.

53:20.826 --> 53:24.154
As soon as you make it,
I'll come in fast.

53:51.861 --> 53:56.398
We'll have a tea party. How many
lumps of sugar would you like?

54:01.453 --> 54:05.951
- Dorothy, don't get dirty.
- I won't, it's clean dirt.

54:07.878 --> 54:11.657
Would you like some cream?
Okay, I want some cream.

54:11.757 --> 54:15.045
Here's some cream for you, baby.

54:15.846 --> 54:19.416
My baby's been sick.
She's got a temperature.

54:19.516 --> 54:23.587
I don't know what I'm gonna do with her.

54:23.687 --> 54:27.926
- I'll probably...
- It's just me. We'll play a game, okay?

54:28.026 --> 54:30.554
Sure, Pacer. But you scared me.

54:30.654 --> 54:33.807
- Your pa will play too.
- He don't play good.

54:33.907 --> 54:37.403
Hey, doc! Doc Phillips!

54:39.456 --> 54:41.733
Leave her alone!

54:41.833 --> 54:45.863
- Get your horse and bag! Make it fast!
- Don't hurt her!

54:45.963 --> 54:48.783
Go on, do like he says!

54:48.883 --> 54:51.744
If you hurt her, I'll get you, savage!

54:51.844 --> 54:54.705
Stay where you are, Pierce!

54:54.805 --> 54:58.795
Indian, any harm comes
to that girl and you're dead!

54:58.895 --> 55:02.048
Just keep talking, Ford,
you'll be dead now!

55:02.148 --> 55:04.050
Adults can't play, eh?

55:04.150 --> 55:08.188
This is funny playing, Pacer.
I don't like it much.

55:08.447 --> 55:10.691
I won't hurt you, Dottie.

55:14.536 --> 55:16.780
Doc's gonna come with us.

55:20.001 --> 55:22.204
Oh, my baby!

55:27.635 --> 55:32.007
If anybody follows us,
there'll be pure hell to pay!

55:41.943 --> 55:45.513
Sorry. I wanted to come
with you from the start.

55:45.613 --> 55:47.440
Shut up!

55:48.492 --> 55:52.989
- They following us?
- Just one. Come on, this way!

55:58.920 --> 56:01.623
Keep quiet, now.

56:15.022 --> 56:18.217
Can I help you with her, Clint?

56:18.317 --> 56:23.265
- You need her, doc?
- She's helped me before.

56:23.365 --> 56:25.817
All right, let's go.

59:36.708 --> 59:38.535
Neddy?

59:46.427 --> 59:48.755
Neddy!

01:00:14.459 --> 01:00:16.744
Neddy!

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.920
Neddy, honey!

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.848
Answer me!

01:00:42.408 --> 01:00:44.610
Honey!

01:00:55.839 --> 01:00:57.782
Neddy, honey!

01:00:57.882 --> 01:01:01.128
Neddy, why did you do it?

01:01:02.263 --> 01:01:04.256
Sam...

01:01:04.682 --> 01:01:08.754
I saw the flaming star of death.

01:01:08.854 --> 01:01:10.932
Oh, no!

01:01:11.149 --> 01:01:13.217
No, honey!

01:01:13.317 --> 01:01:15.311
No!

01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:38.253
One thing from the Bible she liked:

01:01:39.138 --> 01:01:43.134
"And Adam called his wife's name Eve...

01:01:43.727 --> 01:01:46.763
as she was the mother of all living."

01:01:48.982 --> 01:01:53.896
To me, Neddy,
you were the mother of all the living.

01:01:55.114 --> 01:01:58.275
You were life itself.

01:02:03.875 --> 01:02:05.735
God...

01:02:05.835 --> 01:02:08.496
just one thing.

01:02:09.464 --> 01:02:11.708
Take care of this woman.

01:02:14.595 --> 01:02:16.338
Amen.

01:02:58.186 --> 01:03:01.882
Why don't you two eat
before everything gets cold?

01:03:01.982 --> 01:03:04.551
I'm gonna wait for Pa.

01:03:04.651 --> 01:03:07.220
He wouldn't want you to wait.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.391
You know who done it, don't you?

01:03:10.491 --> 01:03:12.318
You!

01:03:13.244 --> 01:03:15.229
That won't do any good.

01:03:15.329 --> 01:03:18.942
Wasting all that time.
You and them other people!

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:22.697
I couldn't have done anything.
I saw that wound...

01:03:22.797 --> 01:03:26.284
- Nobody wanted to do anything!
- That's not true.

01:03:26.384 --> 01:03:29.121
- And you neither!
- Stop that.

01:03:29.221 --> 01:03:33.959
But you saw him! Arguing and stalling,
all the time Ma's dying!

01:03:34.059 --> 01:03:36.462
Keeping us more than an hour!

01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:39.681
Five minutes before we arrived,
she died!

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:43.887
If we'd gotten here a little bit
sooner she might be alive!

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:46.431
You know it's his fault.

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.851
- Put it down!
- Get out of the way!

01:03:48.951 --> 01:03:51.271
They let her die!

01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:55.776
I couldn't have saved her.
The woman was bleeding internally!

01:03:55.876 --> 01:03:56.985
The woman?

01:03:57.085 --> 01:03:59.696
- She's got a name, like whites!
- Pacer!

01:03:59.796 --> 01:04:02.200
Well, I meant Mrs. Burton.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.328
See? All she was
to all of them was a squaw.

01:04:05.428 --> 01:04:07.205
This won't bring Ma back.

01:04:07.305 --> 01:04:09.457
A white man shot her...

01:04:09.557 --> 01:04:11.926
and a white man let her die!

01:04:21.112 --> 01:04:23.607
Drop it!

01:04:31.665 --> 01:04:34.911
Please, Pacer, drop it.

01:04:35.879 --> 01:04:38.289
Please.

01:05:05.579 --> 01:05:09.609
- You all right?
- You're both crazy!

01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:12.662
You ought to have let me kill him.

01:05:13.296 --> 01:05:16.200
No good could be done. It wouldn't help.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.078
People that held us
up at the Crossing...

01:05:19.178 --> 01:05:21.873
I want to see every one of them dead.

01:05:21.973 --> 01:05:25.126
You're talking foolish.
You sound like a...

01:05:25.226 --> 01:05:26.970
A Kiowa?

01:05:28.772 --> 01:05:32.217
- I wasn't gonna say that.
- That's what I am.

01:05:32.317 --> 01:05:35.221
That's what Ma was and why she's dead.

01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:38.142
That's what I'm gonna be from now on.

01:05:38.242 --> 01:05:41.270
You know I didn't mean it that way.

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:44.857
You don't feel it like
I do about Ma's death.

01:05:44.957 --> 01:05:46.609
I'm Indian.

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:50.071
I won't forget whites killed
her because of it!

01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:55.368
- Will was dying, he was crazy!
- I don't want no more excuses for him.

01:05:55.468 --> 01:05:58.956
All whites ever gave me and Ma
was mean looks and insults.

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:01.927
That's not true!

01:06:02.185 --> 01:06:04.213
You were the worst.

01:06:04.313 --> 01:06:07.382
You made me feel it the worst.

01:06:07.482 --> 01:06:10.136
When I was little, I liked you a lot.

01:06:10.236 --> 01:06:13.181
You were the only girl
I liked a whole lot.

01:06:13.281 --> 01:06:18.019
Since you been old enough,
you never looked at me without thinking:

01:06:18.119 --> 01:06:19.939
"He's Kiowa.

01:06:20.039 --> 01:06:23.234
Clint's all right,
but watch out for Pacer."

01:06:23.334 --> 01:06:24.985
Oh, I didn't know!

01:06:25.085 --> 01:06:27.656
I didn't know it either.

01:06:27.756 --> 01:06:30.833
Nobody knew but Ma and me.

01:06:34.597 --> 01:06:36.624
Where you going?

01:06:36.724 --> 01:06:40.670
- To join up with Buffalo Horn.
- You're a civilized man!

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:44.341
- Folks at the Crossing are civilized.
- You can't go.

01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:49.429
Now, look, we already had one fight.
The first one we ever had.

01:06:49.529 --> 01:06:52.190
I won't lose this one!

01:06:53.452 --> 01:06:57.481
This ain't to be fought with fists.
I'm changing my life.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:00.242
Put that gun down.

01:07:02.002 --> 01:07:04.489
All right.

01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:07.792
If you can draw that gun and cock it...

01:07:11.137 --> 01:07:13.548
then get out.

01:07:15.184 --> 01:07:16.794
And to hell with you!

01:07:16.894 --> 01:07:18.762
Just don't come after me.

01:07:56.398 --> 01:07:58.475
Is this goodbye?

01:08:00.193 --> 01:08:01.928
Yes, sir.

01:08:02.028 --> 01:08:05.056
- Back to Ma's folks?
- I'm sorry.

01:08:05.156 --> 01:08:07.651
So am I, but I understand.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.898
It never come to my mind it would be
like this when I married Neddy.

01:08:11.998 --> 01:08:15.778
I guess folks ain't
never been fair with you.

01:08:15.878 --> 01:08:19.866
They take a man for what
he ought to be, not what he is.

01:08:19.966 --> 01:08:23.453
- I ain't blaming you.
- I know. You're a good boy.

01:08:23.553 --> 01:08:27.372
I've always been proud of you.
Do what you must do...

01:08:27.473 --> 01:08:34.096
with my blessings. No matter
where you go, whatever happens.

01:08:35.608 --> 01:08:38.519
Goodbye, son.

01:08:39.488 --> 01:08:41.398
Bye, Pa.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:04.874
Funny how things turn out.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:10.631
When I got here, all I had was you
and me. You were just a baby.

01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:17.188
Then I gave Neddy's father a shotgun
and a pound of black powder for her.

01:09:18.073 --> 01:09:20.850
What a pretty little thing she was too!

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:25.613
The day we got married there
wasn't a prettier girl in Texas.

01:09:29.085 --> 01:09:32.371
I can't tell you how much
I came to love her.

01:09:35.676 --> 01:09:40.747
After all these years, and another
little baby and all our work...

01:09:40.848 --> 01:09:44.469
to make a home and get us a herd...

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:51.643
We're right back where we started.
Just you and me again.

01:10:37.705 --> 01:10:39.899
I will fight in his place.

01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:42.985
- Who did this?
- A white man.

01:10:43.085 --> 01:10:47.157
He also killed N'edd'ee-pahs,
the woman who was my mother.

01:10:47.257 --> 01:10:50.460
My words are dust.
But my heart is with you.

01:10:50.844 --> 01:10:52.747
One thing you must know.

01:10:52.847 --> 01:10:56.209
I will never fight my father
nor my brother.

01:10:56.309 --> 01:10:59.463
Your father, your brother,
and your home...

01:10:59.563 --> 01:11:02.933
will be safe from attack,
as our own people.

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:12.560
When we fight,
I will think of my mother...

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.980
and of how Two Moons tried to help her.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:19.034
And I will be strong.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.749
Very strong.

01:11:38.147 --> 01:11:42.886
- I'll be back to see you, Pa.
- You do that, Roz.

01:11:42.986 --> 01:11:47.984
- We'll do the best we can anyway.
- We'll sure try.

01:11:51.872 --> 01:11:54.233
That bay is still limping.

01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:58.571
I'm giving you the sorrel.
We'll give your horse back later.

01:11:58.671 --> 01:12:01.240
- Bye, Pa.
- Bye.

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:02.867
Don't go too far.

01:12:02.967 --> 01:12:07.422
- Let the herd take care of itself.
- I'll be all right.

01:12:17.776 --> 01:12:21.722
I won't say what Pacer had in mind.
He'll be back.

01:12:21.822 --> 01:12:25.318
I don't know.
He's been pushed a long way.

01:12:25.868 --> 01:12:29.897
- I wonder if you'll be back.
- I said I would, didn't I?

01:12:29.997 --> 01:12:31.482
It's plain hate now.

01:12:31.582 --> 01:12:35.696
Everybody's ready to kill
anybody who isn't just like them.

01:12:35.796 --> 01:12:37.698
I'll be back, all right.

01:12:37.798 --> 01:12:41.411
- Get down and into the house!
- Don't talk like that.

01:12:41.511 --> 01:12:45.166
- I'm no girl, I'm a woman.
- Want me to pull you down?

01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:47.509
I don't.

01:12:51.313 --> 01:12:54.467
- You know Neddy died?
- I know a lot of things.

01:12:54.567 --> 01:12:59.765
I know Pacer went at doc with a knife.
I know the Thomases died last night.

01:12:59.865 --> 01:13:03.360
All four of them.
Nothing left but ashes!

01:13:03.702 --> 01:13:07.733
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

01:13:07.833 --> 01:13:11.070
You know that Phil Thomas
was my best friend.

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:14.164
Then why didn't you warn him?

01:13:16.842 --> 01:13:18.119
Goodbye, Roz.

01:13:18.219 --> 01:13:21.456
Wait, Dred! You got room for us?

01:13:21.556 --> 01:13:24.967
We'll make room for you!

01:13:25.393 --> 01:13:28.130
That's the fifth wagon in this morning.

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:33.770
They're all scared to death. But I guess
you got nothing to worry about.

01:14:04.355 --> 01:14:06.632
He is alone. Let us kill him.

01:14:06.732 --> 01:14:11.012
Maybe it's best if we find
Buffalo Horn before fighting.

01:14:11.112 --> 01:14:14.649
The gods are making us
a gift of this enemy.

01:19:26.969 --> 01:19:28.795
Hang on, Clint!

01:20:37.506 --> 01:20:40.544
I thought you were so tough!

01:20:41.219 --> 01:20:45.332
Feels like you're trying
to torture me to death.

01:20:45.432 --> 01:20:48.302
You damn savage!

01:20:55.193 --> 01:20:57.729
Can you hear me?

01:20:57.988 --> 01:21:03.185
- We have to get out of here.
- You go. I'm too tired.

01:21:03.285 --> 01:21:06.781
We still got about
an hour before daylight.

01:21:08.834 --> 01:21:10.569
What are you doing?

01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:15.574
I'm gonna try and draw them
the other way. They'd recognize this.

01:21:15.674 --> 01:21:17.828
Crazy.

01:21:17.928 --> 01:21:23.300
- Maybe in the dark I'll look Indian.
- Your hair's too short.

01:21:25.018 --> 01:21:29.473
If we're not out of here by sunup,
it'll be a lot shorter.

01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:13.227
We're never gonna get
a better time than this.

01:25:17.197 --> 01:25:21.318
- Think you can hold on again?
- I can make it.

01:25:25.832 --> 01:25:30.162
Come on. Watch your head.

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:04.117
They still coming?

01:26:04.501 --> 01:26:07.405
Yeah, but they're in no hurry anymore.

01:26:07.505 --> 01:26:09.156
Why?

01:26:09.256 --> 01:26:13.043
They know who we are now,
and where to find us.

01:26:30.739 --> 01:26:32.224
Hey, Pa!

01:26:32.324 --> 01:26:33.559
Pa!

01:26:33.659 --> 01:26:36.236
Pa's dead.

01:26:37.037 --> 01:26:39.574
Kiowas.

01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:49.752
- We're all the family we got left now.
- That's right.

01:27:06.237 --> 01:27:09.357
We got to get in the house
and get ready.

01:27:16.666 --> 01:27:18.785
Pacer?

01:27:22.923 --> 01:27:25.084
Pacer!

01:27:42.027 --> 01:27:43.689
Come on.

01:27:51.496 --> 01:27:55.235
- What's the idea?
- You're gonna take a ride.

01:27:55.335 --> 01:28:02.166
What are you talking about? I'm going
in the house. We got to get ready.

01:28:02.592 --> 01:28:06.247
- What are you doing?
- He'll take you to the Crossing.

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:09.383
- Are you coming with me?
- Nope.

01:28:10.435 --> 01:28:14.047
- That's crazy. There are too many.
- I know it.

01:28:14.147 --> 01:28:19.645
But if it's gonna be like this
the rest of my life, to hell with it!

01:28:21.781 --> 01:28:25.727
Let me meet them with you.
That's the way I feel.

01:28:25.827 --> 01:28:29.448
You'll be doing good
to make it to the Crossing.

01:28:31.083 --> 01:28:33.660
Pacer!

01:29:18.971 --> 01:29:22.207
- How long have I been here?
- Since last night.

01:29:22.307 --> 01:29:25.586
- Get me a horse.
- Doc says you shouldn't move.

01:29:25.686 --> 01:29:30.468
- I'm not staying here.
- You can't ride in your condition.

01:29:30.568 --> 01:29:33.012
- Get me that horse!
- I can't...

01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:36.766
- You feeling better?
- Never mind, I'll get it myself.

01:29:36.866 --> 01:29:41.237
- Now, look here, Clint.
- You want to get shot?

01:29:41.496 --> 01:29:43.190
Rider coming in!

01:29:43.290 --> 01:29:45.951
Looks like he's bad hurt.

01:30:15.409 --> 01:30:17.861
Don't come no closer.

01:30:18.829 --> 01:30:21.565
I wanted to make sure you're all right.

01:30:21.665 --> 01:30:24.620
Don't try to help me, Clint.

01:30:24.921 --> 01:30:27.657
I've been killed already.

01:30:27.757 --> 01:30:30.201
I'm just stubborn about dying.

01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:33.504
- Let me get the doc.
- Too late.

01:30:33.722 --> 01:30:35.457
Too late.

01:30:35.557 --> 01:30:38.335
The only thing to do now is to die.

01:30:38.435 --> 01:30:41.888
Pacer! For God's sake!

01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:44.843
You live for me, Clint.

01:30:44.943 --> 01:30:47.262
Maybe someday...

01:30:47.362 --> 01:30:52.192
somewhere, people will
understand folks like us.

01:30:56.915 --> 01:30:59.117
Oh, you'll be all right.

01:31:01.169 --> 01:31:05.282
When I was fighting
off the other Kiowas...

01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:09.879
I saw the flaming star of death.

01:31:11.305 --> 01:31:15.426
I gotta last long enough
to go into the hills and die.

01:31:18.022 --> 01:31:21.058
I'll trust you not to follow me, Clint.

01:31:21.484 --> 01:31:23.686
Pacer!

01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:28.692
Hey, Pacer!

01:31:29.201 --> 01:31:32.112
Pacer!

01:31:33.305 --> 01:31:39.386
