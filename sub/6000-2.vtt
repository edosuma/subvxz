WEBVTT

00:01.510 --> 00:03.083
I couldn't get pregnant.

00:03.084 --> 00:05.099
And we decided to
look for an egg donor.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.012
They chose me.

00:06.013 --> 00:07.880
I am your real mother.

00:11.295 --> 00:12.503
Lori came to the house?

00:12.504 --> 00:14.312
She gave me this picture of you.

00:14.313 --> 00:16.640
I know things, David did
a number on both of us.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.064
She said something strange.

00:18.065 --> 00:19.911
What did she mean by that?

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:35.200 --> 00:36.736
Tay?

00:40.038 --> 00:41.307
Are you okay?

00:42.316 --> 00:44.076
Yeah.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.355
Yeah, I think so.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.636
I don't know.

00:48.637 --> 00:50.540
Been up all night
thinking about everything.

00:50.541 --> 00:52.820
Yeah, yesterday was insane.

00:53.691 --> 00:54.803
Maybe we should take today off,

00:54.804 --> 00:56.556
you know, just, like,
stay home and recover.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.576
No, no, I think that we
should just move on.

00:59.677 --> 01:01.219
You know, not dwell.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.400
I have a lot of stuff to do

01:02.401 --> 01:04.904
and I don't want to fall behind.

01:05.004 --> 01:06.716
I have an e-contest
this morning.

01:06.717 --> 01:08.051
Okay.

01:10.711 --> 01:11.839
You sure you're okay?

01:11.840 --> 01:13.544
Yeah, I'll see you downstairs.

01:28.433 --> 01:30.170
I've got it under control.

01:31.706 --> 01:33.042
Look, you...

01:33.043 --> 01:34.730
You knew eventually
it would come to this.

01:34.731 --> 01:36.434
The truth has to come out.

01:39.705 --> 01:40.913
Are you threatening me?

01:44.798 --> 01:46.501
I just don't understand
how she found us.

01:46.502 --> 01:47.797
I don't know, Linds.

01:47.798 --> 01:49.117
It was 18 years ago.

01:49.118 --> 01:51.283
But we signed a confidentiality contract.

01:51.284 --> 01:53.611
I'm starting to think that we
need to sue that clinic.

01:53.612 --> 01:55.364
I just want to put
all this behind us.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.908
Every bit of it, finally.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.277
Well, we're almost there.

01:58.278 --> 02:00.419
The FBI's interrogating
her tomorrow.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.491
Are you gonna be there?

02:02.014 --> 02:04.791
I don't know. I'm not sure how
much more I can take.

02:06.270 --> 02:07.727
She's delusional.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.431
Like, that thing that
she said about...

02:11.087 --> 02:13.094
You knowing things that
I would want to know.

02:14.127 --> 02:17.840
Made up things from the mind of
a very disturbed person.

02:19.799 --> 02:21.887
I'll see you downstairs.

02:27.307 --> 02:28.404
Hey.

02:28.805 --> 02:30.148
Are you okay?

02:32.323 --> 02:33.499
I don't know.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.371
It's gonna take some time
to get your balance back.

02:36.379 --> 02:37.883
Dad...

02:39.563 --> 02:41.195
There's this one
thing that happened,

02:41.196 --> 02:43.035
it's been kinda bothering me.

02:44.307 --> 02:45.499
Tell me.

02:48.651 --> 02:50.539
When I woke up
in the motel room,

02:51.740 --> 02:53.847
Lori was on the phone
with someone.

02:56.011 --> 02:58.184
I think someone was helping her.

02:58.882 --> 03:00.484
Like who? Someone
you knew before?

03:00.485 --> 03:01.435
I don't know.

03:01.436 --> 03:03.171
It sounded like
someone she knew.

03:04.291 --> 03:05.923
And...

03:07.123 --> 03:09.227
Like someone who knew me.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.295
What makes you think that?

03:43.296 --> 03:45.015
I don't know,
it's the way she sounded.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.116
Really familiar, like she knew
them really well or something.

03:48.117 --> 03:50.124
They already knew everything
that was going on.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.850
I don't know who she
was talking to, I'm sorry.

03:55.531 --> 03:57.075
It wasn't you, was it, dad?

03:57.076 --> 03:58.675
Me?

03:58.676 --> 04:00.531
My God, no.

04:00.532 --> 04:01.988
I was looking for you, Carter.

04:01.989 --> 04:03.668
I was frantic,
like everyone else.

04:03.669 --> 04:05.403
Okay.

04:06.740 --> 04:08.546
Go can stop thinking about it.

04:11.187 --> 04:12.835
You've been through a lot.

04:12.836 --> 04:13.970
Yeah.

04:13.971 --> 04:15.222
We all have.

04:22.569 --> 04:24.496
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.792
Do you want anything else?

04:25.793 --> 04:26.656
Some eggs?

04:26.657 --> 04:28.796
No, I'm good. But thank you.

04:28.797 --> 04:30.189
We have stuff for waffles.

04:30.190 --> 04:32.583
I haven't had waffles
since I was, like, ten.

04:34.484 --> 04:36.028
Do you want a ride to school?

04:36.029 --> 04:39.070
No, mom, stop acting weird.
It's freaking me out.

04:39.808 --> 04:41.551
The last 72 hours have
been pretty weird.

04:41.552 --> 04:43.126
I guess I'm a little off-kilter.

04:43.127 --> 04:44.669
Weird is kind of an
understatement.

04:47.670 --> 04:50.191
I think it'd be great if we
all just got back to normal,

04:50.192 --> 04:51.751
you know, stay on track.

04:51.952 --> 04:52.870
Great policy.

04:52.871 --> 04:53.854
Hey.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.230
You sleep okay?

04:59.231 --> 05:00.127
Yeah, you?

05:00.128 --> 05:01.070
So-so.

05:01.071 --> 05:02.426
Sorry.

05:02.674 --> 05:03.967
Hey.

05:04.586 --> 05:05.931
- Hi.
- Morning.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.417
Hey, Armadillo.

05:09.661 --> 05:13.042
Hey, isn't it a little
early for murder music?

05:13.043 --> 05:14.346
Not in this house.

05:14.683 --> 05:15.573
- Are you okay?
- Mhm.

05:15.608 --> 05:18.168
You're here, Taylor's here,
Max is here.

05:19.132 --> 05:20.796
That crazy woman's
going to jail, right?

05:22.043 --> 05:23.057
Then I'm good.

05:23.092 --> 05:24.483
- Anyone need a ride?
- Good.

05:24.484 --> 05:26.107
- Yeah.
- How about you guys?

05:26.108 --> 05:27.840
No, I'm taking him
to physical therapy.

05:27.841 --> 05:28.945
I thought you had econ.

05:28.946 --> 05:31.279
Yeah, but I can take
him and still make it.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.891
That's okay,
I can find my own way.

05:32.892 --> 05:33.594
It's not a big deal.

05:33.595 --> 05:34.865
You sure?
I really don't want you to...

05:34.866 --> 05:36.901
Yeah, Tay, don't worry,
I got this.

05:37.381 --> 05:38.492
Fine.

05:38.493 --> 05:39.764
Take him.

05:41.149 --> 05:42.348
Tay, cool?

05:42.349 --> 05:44.225
Yeah, totally cool.

05:44.226 --> 05:45.490
All right,
see the rest of you later.

05:45.491 --> 05:46.481
Okay.

05:46.505 --> 05:47.337
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:48.506 --> 05:49.890
- See you later.
- Bye.

05:49.925 --> 05:51.364
- Mom?
- Yeah?

05:51.686 --> 05:54.008
Are you seeing Lori today?

05:54.536 --> 05:58.198
No, but tomorrow, she's being
interrogated by the FBI.

05:58.897 --> 06:00.436
You think I could come to that?

06:00.437 --> 06:02.581
- What? No. Absolutely not.
- Why?

06:02.616 --> 06:05.511
Because I don't want
you anywhere near her.

06:05.556 --> 06:07.175
What? Is there...

06:07.176 --> 06:08.528
Something you
don't want me to hear?

06:08.529 --> 06:09.984
Yes, her voice.

06:10.285 --> 06:12.979
It's in the hands
of the FBI, okay?

06:12.980 --> 06:13.972
You're not going,

06:13.973 --> 06:15.987
there's nothing more you
need to know from Lori.

06:15.988 --> 06:17.459
Okay.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.519
Bye.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.715
Come on, Max.

06:27.768 --> 06:30.100
It's the AP
Microeconomics paper.

06:30.987 --> 06:32.254
Here it is.

06:32.255 --> 06:38.072
Axiomatic Theory of Expected Utility
Equilibrium Strategies in Convex Compacts.

06:38.073 --> 06:40.375
Are you the one who said we
should take this class?

06:40.376 --> 06:41.597
- Yes.
- Okay, so,

06:41.598 --> 06:43.171
you really want to finish this project?

06:43.172 --> 06:44.500
'Cause really, it's kind of,

06:44.501 --> 06:45.799
you know, lost its
luster for me.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.919
We have to finish this project.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.583
It's more than half our
final grade.

06:49.590 --> 06:51.363
I didn't think you'd
even be here today.

06:51.364 --> 06:52.742
Why? Stuff to do.

06:52.743 --> 06:54.623
Hey, I don't judge,
you know that.

06:54.624 --> 06:56.511
People handle issues
the way they want.

06:56.847 --> 06:58.315
I'm sorry.

06:58.967 --> 07:00.511
I didn't mean to sound
defensive, I just...

07:00.512 --> 07:03.375
Everyone thinks the world should
stop spinning, I don't get it.

07:03.376 --> 07:04.879
Maybe they're just
trying to process.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.287
Well, this is my process.

07:06.782 --> 07:08.143
And I'm done.

07:18.853 --> 07:20.318
I'm... early.

07:22.551 --> 07:27.046
I don't get why my mom won't let
me hear Lori's interrogation.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.159
She just doesn't want you
to see how messed-up Lori is.

07:29.194 --> 07:30.823
Okay, but come on, Max.

07:31.238 --> 07:33.127
She wasn't always
this messed up.

07:33.128 --> 07:34.247
Remember, you knew her.

07:34.248 --> 07:35.918
I don't know, maybe it's
everything she's been through

07:35.919 --> 07:37.184
since I got back here.

07:37.185 --> 07:40.711
Still. It doesn't explain why she took
you in the first place.

07:40.735 --> 07:41.926
Yeah.

07:42.575 --> 07:46.019
Look, I know she's
done awful things.

07:46.020 --> 07:47.975
Believe me, I know she has, but

07:49.047 --> 07:50.568
I just want to know why.

07:51.687 --> 07:53.507
Because okay, that stuff
with the egg donor thing,

07:53.508 --> 07:55.300
there's so much
more to the story

07:55.301 --> 07:57.436
than anyone ever told me.

07:58.137 --> 08:00.883
And, like, why did she want to
meet our mom and dad after?

08:00.884 --> 08:02.919
She knew what she was getting
into, she was an egg donor.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.947
It's not like she
put us up for adoption.

08:06.851 --> 08:08.367
I don't know, I just...

08:10.127 --> 08:11.939
I feel like there's
more to the story.

08:13.208 --> 08:15.303
I think Elizabeth
is just trying to protect you.

08:15.304 --> 08:16.727
Yeah, but that's the thing.

08:17.767 --> 08:19.183
Protect me from what?

08:24.347 --> 08:25.754
- Liz?
- Hey.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.505
You did good, how you
handled the whole thing.

08:29.657 --> 08:30.942
Thank you.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.222
It's just the family
fallout, you know?

08:33.222 --> 08:35.482
Yeah, well, kids are
stronger than we think.

08:36.398 --> 08:37.293
They'll survive.

08:37.294 --> 08:38.782
It's just her.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.366
Lori.

08:40.368 --> 08:42.674
It's over but she's still
stirring the pot.

08:42.676 --> 08:43.945
What do you mean?

08:45.069 --> 08:45.965
Nothing.

08:48.950 --> 08:51.074
I was thinking I'd go to
the interrogation tomorrow,

08:51.075 --> 08:52.350
save you the trouble.

08:52.751 --> 08:55.541
- Cool?
- Yeah. It's cool.

08:55.974 --> 08:57.462
It's very cool.

08:58.175 --> 08:59.568
- Thank you, Kyle.
- Yeah.

09:11.807 --> 09:13.587
- Hey.
- My God.

09:13.588 --> 09:15.176
- Hey.
- It's about time.

09:15.177 --> 09:16.396
Hey.

09:16.397 --> 09:17.772
Hey.

09:18.611 --> 09:20.873
- Okay, seriously.
- Okay, seriously.

09:20.874 --> 09:23.257
So we all agreed, when you were
gone, we were all terrified.

09:23.258 --> 09:24.569
Yesterday was beyond intense.

09:24.570 --> 09:26.345
The whole news blackout thing?
Freaky.

09:26.346 --> 09:27.622
Okay, who's in charge
of that stuff?

09:27.623 --> 09:28.980
Bird, I'm trying to say
something here.

09:28.981 --> 09:30.797
- Okay, sorry, go ahead.
- Okay, I'll say it.

09:30.798 --> 09:31.990
While you were gone, we realized

09:31.991 --> 09:33.801
the world would
suck without you in it.

09:33.802 --> 09:35.494
I mean, we already knew that,

09:35.495 --> 09:38.117
but a kidnapping really has
a way of bringing it home.

09:38.118 --> 09:40.788
Which is why I have a
remedy for all that ails us.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.978
- You always do.
- Let me guess.

09:41.979 --> 09:43.456
A welcome back Carter party.

09:43.457 --> 09:47.461
A fiesta, a <i> fête,</i> a festive
gathering of kind folks

09:47.462 --> 09:49.846
who are relieved
and grateful that you're back.

09:49.847 --> 09:52.414
That's really sweet, Bird, but I don't
know if I can deal with a whole...

09:52.415 --> 09:54.179
No, you don't even have
to lift a finger,

09:54.180 --> 09:55.910
because this happens
to be one of my strengths.

09:55.911 --> 09:58.539
Throwing parties and hiring
people to do all the work.

09:59.111 --> 10:00.044
Okay.

10:00.045 --> 10:01.635
- Shall we?
- Yes.

10:01.636 --> 10:02.756
Welcome back.

10:09.179 --> 10:10.523
I know.

10:10.524 --> 10:11.858
I know, but...

10:12.834 --> 10:14.180
It's cool.

10:17.692 --> 10:18.499
Do you need a ride?

10:18.500 --> 10:19.771
No, I don't need a ride.

10:19.772 --> 10:21.042
Dude, you want me
to call the cops?

10:21.043 --> 10:22.467
No, just...

10:22.468 --> 10:23.876
Just listen. I...

10:25.419 --> 10:27.412
I need you to know that
I know what I did.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.461
I made a mistake.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.063
That's an understatement.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.662
Here, but I... look.
I'm not that guy anymore.

10:33.663 --> 10:35.535
What, the guy who tried to run
away with my best friend?

10:35.536 --> 10:38.335
Or the guy who asked me to give
him money and then shot me?

10:38.336 --> 10:39.487
Which guy aren't you anymore?

10:39.488 --> 10:41.166
Neither. You'll see.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.294
I don't want to see.

10:42.295 --> 10:43.575
I want you to leave me alone.

10:46.415 --> 10:48.079
How the hell did you
even get out of jail?

10:48.114 --> 10:50.193
It's legit, I have this uncle...

10:50.194 --> 10:52.215
Forget it, forget it.
I don't want to know.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.855
Stay away from me.

10:54.856 --> 10:56.270
I get that, but I need you
to understand...

10:56.271 --> 10:58.019
Dude, stay away from me!

11:06.576 --> 11:10.249
Apparently, the FBI does transcripts
of all of their interrogations.

11:10.650 --> 11:12.497
I wonder if I could get
a copy of Lori's.

11:12.498 --> 11:14.228
I don't get why you
keep pushing this.

11:14.329 --> 11:15.272
Okay, I am telling you,

11:15.273 --> 11:17.248
she was on the phone
with someone in the motel room.

11:17.249 --> 11:18.396
- It was weird.
- So what?

11:18.397 --> 11:21.136
She was in cahoots with someone
and they kidnapped you together?

11:21.137 --> 11:22.469
Maybe, yeah.

11:23.460 --> 11:24.845
Look, I don't know
what's going on, okay?

11:24.846 --> 11:26.113
I just...

11:26.804 --> 11:28.837
I know there is more to this
than my parents are telling me.

11:28.838 --> 11:32.262
Sweetie, what you have
is called <i> idée fixe.</i>

11:32.263 --> 11:35.455
Okay, you're maniacally
preoccupied with an idea that

11:35.456 --> 11:38.043
has no basis in reality.

11:38.733 --> 11:40.182
Did you just call me a maniac?

11:40.183 --> 11:41.863
I guess I did.

11:42.582 --> 11:43.582
What, you don't believe me?

11:43.583 --> 11:46.550
I believe that you went through
some hideous trauma and you need

11:46.551 --> 11:49.591
as much drink, dance and love
as I can dole out.

11:50.021 --> 11:50.943
Thanks, B.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.774
You know I love you, right?

11:53.175 --> 11:54.774
Like, no joke.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.126
Good.

11:57.127 --> 12:01.090
Now, get ready to party
and stop thinking about the FBI, okay?

12:01.919 --> 12:02.686
Okay.

12:03.487 --> 12:05.018
Hey, hey! Put the keg over here.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.462
You said Lori snuck
into your house

12:35.463 --> 12:36.798
and took this picture of you.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.095
She did.

12:39.566 --> 12:40.750
I don't believe you.

12:46.479 --> 12:48.567
Is this about the phone call
in the motel?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.223
No, not just that.

12:52.799 --> 12:55.190
Dad, there has to be
a reason she's doing this.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.614
Why would she take me twice?

12:56.615 --> 12:57.895
Why would she risk it?

12:57.896 --> 12:59.182
And why did she suddenly decide

12:59.183 --> 13:01.254
she needed to tell us
she was the egg donor?

13:01.255 --> 13:03.666
I know her, dad,
she is getting at something

13:03.667 --> 13:04.887
and I don't know what it is.

13:04.888 --> 13:06.382
Lori is mentally ill.

13:07.274 --> 13:09.090
Whatever led to her extreme
behavior is something

13:09.091 --> 13:10.558
a psychiatrist
is gonna have to solve.

13:10.559 --> 13:13.322
Okay, but she didn't act crazy
when I was growing up.

13:13.323 --> 13:16.551
Honey, I don't know what
made Lori the way she is.

13:18.003 --> 13:20.497
Dad, I feel like you're not
telling me something.

13:20.798 --> 13:23.539
People don't just
do things for no reason

13:24.040 --> 13:26.562
and I am trying to figure
this all out right now

13:26.563 --> 13:29.530
so I can move on
with my life, finally.

13:30.531 --> 13:31.910
And you're not helping me.

13:33.111 --> 13:34.670
Please help me.

13:37.911 --> 13:40.614
Tell me the truth.

13:42.126 --> 13:44.982
Was there something
between you and Lori?

13:49.582 --> 13:52.326
Yes.

13:52.327 --> 13:54.288
Yes, there was.

13:59.468 --> 14:01.828
Your mother and I were going
through a tough time.

14:01.829 --> 14:03.700
We weren't communicating.

14:07.133 --> 14:08.788
I had a one-night stand.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.196
That's it.

14:11.197 --> 14:13.245
It was the biggest
mistake of my life.

14:14.036 --> 14:15.388
And then what happened?

14:15.389 --> 14:16.924
Nothing.

14:18.844 --> 14:20.840
I told her I'd made
a mistake and...

14:22.035 --> 14:23.653
And I could never see her again.

14:24.492 --> 14:25.796
And I didn't...

14:27.292 --> 14:28.492
Until you were found.

14:29.093 --> 14:32.268
Why didn't you say anything?

14:32.969 --> 14:35.476
After I got back. You must have known
it was the same woman.

14:35.477 --> 14:38.116
I knew it was the same woman,
but I also knew I would do

14:38.117 --> 14:39.964
anything to make sure our family

14:39.965 --> 14:42.299
was finally gonna stay together.

14:42.300 --> 14:43.799
Does mom know?

14:44.776 --> 14:46.080
No.

14:46.081 --> 14:47.520
Dad, she has to know.

14:47.521 --> 14:48.623
You have to tell her.

14:55.535 --> 14:57.024
Carter, look at
what your mother,

14:57.025 --> 14:59.561
what all of us have
been through.

14:59.562 --> 15:02.648
Learning that I had an affair
while the two of you were babies

15:02.649 --> 15:04.704
and that it turned
out to be Lori.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.708
That would destroy her.

15:08.709 --> 15:10.104
You understand that.

15:11.496 --> 15:12.924
I know your mom
better than you do.

15:12.925 --> 15:15.541
She is very fragile right now,

15:15.542 --> 15:17.141
more fragile than you know.

15:17.142 --> 15:18.844
Okay, but now I know this.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.932
Now I'm hiding
this from her, too.

15:21.933 --> 15:23.324
That makes me a liar.

15:23.325 --> 15:24.300
You're not a liar.

15:24.301 --> 15:25.997
You're holding sensitive and

15:27.229 --> 15:31.163
upsetting information
and until the time is right,

15:31.164 --> 15:34.268
when it makes sense for her
to hear it, from me.

15:35.764 --> 15:38.868
But until then,
this is between us.

15:44.936 --> 15:46.983
You have to trust me on this.

15:47.584 --> 15:50.224
This is not your
burden to carry.

16:00.302 --> 16:01.576
No.

16:03.256 --> 16:04.351
Hey.

16:04.352 --> 16:06.123
I thought we could
do Taco night.

16:06.491 --> 16:07.598
What do you think?

16:07.599 --> 16:08.865
Mom, you don't have to cook.

16:08.866 --> 16:09.732
Sure I do.

16:09.733 --> 16:12.308
That's what moms do.
It's a mom thing.

16:14.945 --> 16:18.652
Well, we don't adhere to
stereotypes in this house.

16:19.947 --> 16:22.252
Plus, cooking's a Taylor thing,
not a you thing.

16:23.972 --> 16:24.820
What's up?

16:28.916 --> 16:31.195
I just know that
I almost lost you again.

16:32.421 --> 16:34.396
It's hard for me to believe
that the nightmare's over.

16:35.741 --> 16:37.572
Yeah, I know.
I can't stop thinking about it.

16:37.573 --> 16:39.260
That's another reason
why I don't want

16:39.261 --> 16:40.885
to go to that interrogation,
I don't want to hear

16:40.886 --> 16:42.485
another word that
woman has to say.

16:42.486 --> 16:44.533
Okay, but... she's just
gonna rant and rave,

16:44.534 --> 16:45.747
but none of it is going to be

16:45.748 --> 16:48.117
based on any kind of reality.

16:48.118 --> 16:49.260
Which is?

16:49.261 --> 16:50.933
Which is...

16:52.252 --> 16:56.695
That you and Taylor
and Grant are <i> my</i> children.

16:56.696 --> 16:59.247
You're <i> my</i> kids.

16:59.248 --> 17:01.207
There's no other
fathers or mothers.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.094
Nobody but us.

17:03.095 --> 17:07.061
Just your dad and me

17:07.063 --> 17:09.391
and you kids.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.751
Nothing else matters.

17:23.589 --> 17:24.729
Come in.

17:26.556 --> 17:27.549
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:28.605 --> 17:30.228
Mom's trying to cook again.

17:30.229 --> 17:31.932
She's acting weird.

17:33.197 --> 17:34.469
I was thinking...

17:35.468 --> 17:36.485
Maybe you could talk to her.

17:37.581 --> 17:38.701
Me?

17:38.702 --> 17:40.391
- Why?
- Because she's worried.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.487
She wants to make sure we know
she's our real mom, okay?

17:42.488 --> 17:44.210
- No one else.
- Of course she's our real mom.

17:44.611 --> 17:46.243
She's our only mom.

17:46.819 --> 17:49.675
Well, technically, Lori is our...

17:49.676 --> 17:51.258
Please do not say
that woman's name.

17:51.259 --> 17:52.234
Fine.

17:52.235 --> 17:53.410
But will you talk to her?

17:53.411 --> 17:55.714
- Reassure her?
- I have homework to do.

17:56.245 --> 17:57.485
She'll be fine, Carter.

17:57.486 --> 17:58.953
She knows she's our mom.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.277
Just move on.

18:08.013 --> 18:09.213
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.173
Where have you been?

18:10.174 --> 18:11.319
Just taking a nap.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.079
- How was physical therapy?
- Not what I expected.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.500
What do you mean?

18:16.259 --> 18:18.274
I am feeling stronger
already, definitely.

18:18.361 --> 18:19.600
You coming to Bird's tonight?

18:20.001 --> 18:21.361
I wish I could.

18:21.662 --> 18:23.425
Ofe and I have
to finish a project.

18:23.426 --> 18:25.200
Couldn't you do it this weekend?

18:25.937 --> 18:27.089
I don't think so.

18:28.296 --> 18:31.593
It's a school night
and everything, so I get it.

18:31.958 --> 18:33.422
Will you text me?

18:33.723 --> 18:34.918
Cool.

18:34.919 --> 18:36.151
Cool.

18:43.254 --> 18:44.087
Fun.

18:44.088 --> 18:46.215
Not at Bird's party,
but still having fun.

18:46.216 --> 18:48.526
You know, if I had a girlfriend
living at my house,

18:48.527 --> 18:50.447
I wouldn't act like
it's no biggie.

18:50.948 --> 18:52.351
How do you know?

18:52.352 --> 18:53.807
You have to have
a girlfriend first.

18:53.808 --> 18:54.758
I got plenty of girlfriends.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.631
I got ladies all over this town.

18:57.626 --> 18:59.299
I do, I have so many ladies.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.595
- Truth?
- Yeah, of course.

19:02.771 --> 19:03.803
It's not really that great.

19:03.804 --> 19:05.979
- Why?
- Max just seems...

19:07.018 --> 19:08.203
I don't know, different.

19:08.204 --> 19:10.323
Well, the bullet did miss
his heart by a hair.

19:10.324 --> 19:11.475
Yeah, well...

19:11.476 --> 19:13.969
That doesn't really
address the other stuff.

19:15.335 --> 19:17.199
Like, tonight
is a perfect example.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.287
I'm here studying and he's
at a party getting high.

19:21.366 --> 19:22.487
'Cause that's what Max does.

19:23.864 --> 19:25.006
Yeah, but...

19:25.007 --> 19:27.910
Look, I've got one
parent who's a jock

19:27.911 --> 19:30.118
and one who's a total braniac,
but they're good together.

19:30.119 --> 19:31.647
You don't have to be
the same to be in love.

19:32.751 --> 19:34.007
It just feels like

19:34.008 --> 19:35.774
things between us are different.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.543
Everything is different.

19:40.799 --> 19:42.063
Well. But you know what?

19:42.064 --> 19:44.535
I'd like to talk more
about me again,

19:44.536 --> 19:46.575
if we could get back to
that, because...

19:46.576 --> 19:47.674
More... yeah.

19:47.675 --> 19:49.271
- I think I like that a little bit better.
- Yeah.

20:18.204 --> 20:19.081
Hey, pretty lady.

20:19.429 --> 20:20.237
You wanna dance?

20:26.216 --> 20:28.198
- Ooh, what's this?
- Doesn't matter.

20:28.199 --> 20:31.117
May the wind be upon your back
and the sun be upon your face.

20:31.118 --> 20:32.374
Welcome home, Carter.

20:32.375 --> 20:34.358
Don't kidnapped out this place.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.902
Amen.

20:39.451 --> 20:41.177
Yep.

20:41.669 --> 20:43.201
I have not had a drink in...

20:43.236 --> 20:44.734
You're right, you're right.

20:44.736 --> 20:46.561
The shot wasn't enough.

20:46.562 --> 20:47.486
- No, no.
- Here you go.

20:47.487 --> 20:49.694
- Ay-ya-ya.
- Whoa.

20:50.270 --> 20:51.670
Max?

20:54.358 --> 20:55.318
You're totally right, man.

20:55.319 --> 20:57.541
I probably shouldn't have
showed up at the rehab clinic.

20:57.542 --> 20:58.814
Again, I'm sorry
about that, but...

20:58.815 --> 21:00.291
But...

21:06.738 --> 21:07.944
Crash?

21:18.607 --> 21:19.704
How are you here?

21:19.705 --> 21:21.400
He's been following me around.

21:21.401 --> 21:23.423
It's really not ok
that you are here, man.

21:23.424 --> 21:24.895
Actually, um, it's my fault.

21:24.896 --> 21:26.184
He was texting me.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.584
Yo, it's time
for you to move on.

21:27.585 --> 21:28.728
I mean away from here.

21:28.729 --> 21:29.819
I'm just here to talk to Max.

21:29.820 --> 21:30.703
I'm not interested.

21:30.704 --> 21:32.443
Okay, but like I said...

21:32.444 --> 21:35.043
I'm not giving up.

21:37.805 --> 21:38.796
Sorry to bother you.

21:50.557 --> 21:51.755
Crash.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.276
Crash!

21:54.535 --> 21:55.300
- What?
- Wait.

21:55.301 --> 21:57.071
Keep your sword
in your pants, okay?

21:57.072 --> 21:58.112
Let's just give them a minute.

22:00.343 --> 22:01.551
What are you doing here?

22:01.552 --> 22:03.567
You're supposed to be in prison.

22:03.568 --> 22:05.815
I turned in the guy
who sold me the gun.

22:05.816 --> 22:07.520
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

22:07.521 --> 22:08.887
I don't care.
I don't want to see you.

22:08.888 --> 22:10.568
I'm not here to see you,
I'm here to see Max.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.133
What do you want with Max?

22:14.309 --> 22:16.767
You almost killed him, Crash.

22:16.768 --> 22:18.935
You left me in a gas station

22:18.936 --> 22:21.807
- with my friend dying in my arms.
- I know that.

22:22.416 --> 22:23.407
I know.

22:24.799 --> 22:25.816
I'm sorry.

22:27.366 --> 22:28.879
I turned you in.

22:30.495 --> 22:32.294
I turned you in.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.954
I was the reason Elizabeth
showed up that night and you got arrested.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.106
Okay, good. Good.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.548
- What?
- Good.

22:39.549 --> 22:40.699
I deserved it.

22:41.595 --> 22:43.994
I was messed up and dangerous.

22:44.295 --> 22:46.008
If you hadn't told Elizabeth

22:46.009 --> 22:48.147
and I had driven out of town
just like I planned,

22:48.699 --> 22:50.003
I'd probably be dead by now.

22:50.004 --> 22:51.846
I needed someone to stop me.

22:51.847 --> 22:53.550
I didn't know how
to stop myself.

22:55.072 --> 22:57.183
What are you trying to prove
following Max around?

22:57.184 --> 22:58.632
Nothing.

22:59.543 --> 23:01.127
I just want him to know
how sorry I am.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.144
I want him to forgive me.

23:04.145 --> 23:06.014
Well, he's not
gonna forgive you.

23:06.015 --> 23:08.503
You're crazy, why on earth would
he ever forgive you?

23:08.504 --> 23:09.855
I don't know,
but I can't forgive myself

23:09.856 --> 23:12.199
until he understands that
I know I did the wrong thing.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.565
We told you to get out of here.

23:15.925 --> 23:17.253
Are you ready for me to leave?

23:17.254 --> 23:19.517
Yeah.

23:19.518 --> 23:21.150
You heard her.

23:21.704 --> 23:22.922
Listen, Gabe,
I don't know what you...

23:22.923 --> 23:25.313
- No.
- Gabe.

23:25.352 --> 23:27.213
Don't push me again.

23:27.714 --> 23:28.850
Gabe! What the...

23:28.851 --> 23:30.760
No one wants you here, man.

23:34.177 --> 23:35.577
I'm not gonna fight you.

23:37.777 --> 23:39.273
I'm not fighting anyone anymore.

23:52.340 --> 23:53.830
I hope everybody's asleep.

23:53.831 --> 23:55.517
I don't wanna go in.

23:55.518 --> 23:56.741
Come on.

23:56.742 --> 23:59.509
Could this day get any worse?

24:04.551 --> 24:05.761
What is going on?

24:05.762 --> 24:08.477
We just had a little too
much to drink, that's all.

24:09.985 --> 24:11.957
- Whoa, what... what happened?
- Grant, buddy, nothing.

24:11.958 --> 24:13.613
Just beer.
Go back to bed, will you?

24:13.614 --> 24:15.501
It's fine.
I just need to pass out.

24:15.502 --> 24:17.301
It's not nothing. It's Crash.

24:17.302 --> 24:18.845
Who's somehow out of jail.

24:18.846 --> 24:19.849
What?

24:19.850 --> 24:21.185
Gabe, let's just
get Carter upstairs.

24:21.186 --> 24:22.689
You saw Crash?

24:23.914 --> 24:24.985
He didn't stay.

24:24.986 --> 24:27.400
Gabe punched him and also,

24:27.401 --> 24:29.563
I don't love him.

24:35.729 --> 24:37.514
Grant, sorry.

24:37.515 --> 24:40.249
Taylor, Carter just
needs to go to bed.

24:40.250 --> 24:42.481
This is unbelievable.

24:45.274 --> 24:46.813
You got this.

24:55.591 --> 24:57.534
You're not supposed
to climb stairs.

24:57.535 --> 24:59.436
I'm all right.

24:59.437 --> 25:01.461
Max, he almost killed you.

25:01.462 --> 25:03.485
There was blood everywhere.

25:03.486 --> 25:04.685
It was awful.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.182
Yeah.

25:07.183 --> 25:09.428
But I'm here now.

25:14.181 --> 25:16.733
You almost died because of him.

25:17.897 --> 25:19.737
And because of me.

25:19.738 --> 25:22.537
Carter, I'm okay.

25:22.538 --> 25:24.249
All right? I didn't die.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.329
I'm here.

25:25.330 --> 25:26.738
Everything worked out.

25:29.672 --> 25:31.056
You just need to sleep.

25:32.234 --> 25:33.433
Let it go.

25:42.754 --> 25:44.669
I swear, if Carter brings
Crash back into her life,

25:44.670 --> 25:46.821
I will never talk to her again.

25:46.822 --> 25:49.837
He is the reason for every
wrong in this family.

25:49.838 --> 25:51.557
He's not responsible for Lori.

25:51.558 --> 25:54.101
Fine, but maybe he's responsible
for your life right now

25:54.102 --> 25:55.253
and what you're going through.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.542
My life is good.

25:57.154 --> 26:00.011
I'm not dead, I'm not paralyzed.

26:00.012 --> 26:01.547
Are you defending Crash?

26:01.548 --> 26:03.571
No, I'm not defending Crash.

26:03.572 --> 26:07.655
I just don't think it's
a black and white situation.

26:08.539 --> 26:09.703
All right?
I think it's complicated.

26:09.704 --> 26:12.542
What is complicated
about my sister dating

26:12.543 --> 26:14.375
the guy that tried to kill you?

26:14.376 --> 26:16.343
I think that's pretty simple.

26:17.847 --> 26:19.711
Not everything in
life is simple,

26:20.831 --> 26:22.575
even if you want it to be.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.287
Morning.

26:36.023 --> 26:37.071
Morning.

26:38.159 --> 26:39.835
Grant, do you want me
to drop you off?

26:41.620 --> 26:43.348
Taylor, I didn't
see him on purpose.

26:43.349 --> 26:44.901
- Who?
- Crash.

26:44.902 --> 26:46.719
- What?
- She was with Crash last night.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.495
I was not <i> with</i> Crash last night.

26:48.496 --> 26:50.599
It was my fault, he's been
wanting to make it up to me,

26:50.600 --> 26:52.192
he came by Bird's
last night to find me.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.658
It's enough that he even exists.

26:53.659 --> 26:54.681
Let's go, Grant.

26:55.842 --> 26:57.561
I knew he was out of jail,

26:57.562 --> 26:58.934
- but I had no idea he'd show up here.
- You knew?

26:58.935 --> 27:00.885
I didn't know the guy
would dare show his face.

27:00.886 --> 27:02.421
Still, don't you think
that's something

27:02.422 --> 27:03.525
I would've wanted to know?

27:03.526 --> 27:05.004
Promise us you
aren't seeing him.

27:06.245 --> 27:07.869
No, I'm not seeing him.

27:07.870 --> 27:08.869
- Carter.
- What?

27:08.870 --> 27:10.621
I'm the only one telling
the truth in this family

27:10.622 --> 27:12.206
and I'm the bad guy.

27:15.689 --> 27:16.985
I have a class.

27:16.986 --> 27:18.705
Why don't I give you a ride?

27:26.544 --> 27:27.665
This is hard.

27:27.666 --> 27:29.169
I know it is.

27:29.170 --> 27:31.157
I wish you didn't have
to deal with this.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.569
You said you'd hold on
to what I told you

27:35.570 --> 27:37.361
until I think the time is right

27:37.362 --> 27:38.721
to share it with your mom.

27:40.185 --> 27:41.977
I really need you
to keep that promise.

27:41.978 --> 27:44.036
I am keeping that promise.

27:44.985 --> 27:46.773
But that doesn't make it easy.

28:00.981 --> 28:03.313
Crash, man,
you gotta knock it off.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.189
What's wrong with you?

28:05.190 --> 28:06.165
Nothing.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.849
Actually, probably
a lot of things.

28:10.286 --> 28:12.757
Look, I just want to make
this right between us.

28:14.205 --> 28:15.528
Whether I want you to or not?

28:15.929 --> 28:17.298
Yeah.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.089
Why are you so into this?

28:23.768 --> 28:25.337
Turns out...

28:26.937 --> 28:29.193
The safety was on
but the model was faulty.

28:29.194 --> 28:31.593
My lawyers filed a lawsuit
against the gun manufacturers.

28:31.594 --> 28:32.794
- Lawyers.
- Yeah.

28:32.795 --> 28:35.965
I've got this uncle that I haven't seen
since I was, like, two.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.037
He's the one who hired them.

28:37.038 --> 28:38.484
So you're off the hook then.

28:40.189 --> 28:41.109
What do you need to prove to me?

28:41.110 --> 28:44.381
Dude, I've had more chances
than I deserve.

28:46.686 --> 28:49.241
Carter cared about me.
I threw it away.

28:50.714 --> 28:53.541
Elizabeth tried to give
me a break, I threw it away.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.338
Social workers, cops.

28:55.339 --> 28:56.456
Shrinks.

28:56.457 --> 28:58.176
I still acted like a dick.

28:58.177 --> 28:59.568
I can't argue with any of that.

28:59.569 --> 29:01.704
Dude, I've never come that
close to killing anyone.

29:01.705 --> 29:03.481
You're a good person.

29:03.482 --> 29:04.809
You didn't deserve what I did.

29:07.128 --> 29:08.233
Jeez.

29:09.705 --> 29:11.184
I don't know how to do
what I'm doing.

29:13.097 --> 29:14.266
But I'm trying to take
responsibility,

29:14.267 --> 29:15.581
I'm trying to grow up.

29:15.582 --> 29:18.620
So I don't know how long that's
gonna take, but I just...

29:18.621 --> 29:19.822
I can't let this go.

29:36.783 --> 29:37.799
Fine.

29:44.598 --> 29:46.463
Dude, this is really cool.

29:46.464 --> 29:47.879
Hey, man, don't talk.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.676
Just drive.

30:04.715 --> 30:05.691
Are you out of your mind?

30:05.692 --> 30:08.092
I just saw Crash drop you off.

30:09.346 --> 30:12.403
Taylor, you have
to stop being angry at me.

30:12.404 --> 30:14.467
Really? I have to?

30:14.468 --> 30:17.124
Do you know how crazy it is that
you're even talking to him?

30:17.125 --> 30:18.918
He's the guy that shot you.

30:18.919 --> 30:20.349
What, you think
I don't know that?

30:20.350 --> 30:21.556
Are you just gonna
forget about it?

30:21.557 --> 30:22.998
Yeah.

30:22.999 --> 30:24.285
Yeah, I think I'm gonna try.

30:24.286 --> 30:25.980
He almost killed you.

30:28.225 --> 30:29.265
People change.

30:30.585 --> 30:31.585
Yeah, you must be right,

30:31.586 --> 30:34.037
'cause I don't know
who you are anymore.

30:34.969 --> 30:36.313
I'm the same person
that I've always been.

30:36.314 --> 30:37.665
No. You're not.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.576
You're damaged, or something.

30:40.877 --> 30:43.716
I mean, you talk to the guy
who put a gun in your face.

30:44.073 --> 30:45.514
What is wrong with you?

30:45.515 --> 30:47.581
Nothing is wrong with me.

30:48.665 --> 30:49.969
I just...

30:50.270 --> 30:51.893
I don't want to be defined

30:51.894 --> 30:54.508
by the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

31:11.474 --> 31:12.829
Hey.

31:13.230 --> 31:14.517
Hey.

31:19.452 --> 31:22.741
Grant told me you had a big
fight with Taylor about Crash.

31:22.742 --> 31:24.310
Crash...

31:25.014 --> 31:27.740
Has always been a suspect dude.

31:27.741 --> 31:29.773
I don't trust him.

31:31.544 --> 31:33.100
But I believe him when he says

31:33.101 --> 31:34.917
he wants to make
things up to me,

31:35.518 --> 31:37.118
'cause I want to believe him.

31:37.119 --> 31:39.101
You want to believe Crash?

31:40.317 --> 31:41.953
Well, I know that feeling.

31:44.405 --> 31:47.225
Do you really think you can
forgive him for what he did?

31:47.226 --> 31:49.650
I think it'll be hard.

31:51.741 --> 31:54.344
It'll take time, but...

31:54.345 --> 31:57.977
But I can't hold
onto hating him.

31:59.259 --> 32:01.800
That's gonna make me sick.

32:04.545 --> 32:07.234
Do you think
I should forgive him?

32:08.790 --> 32:10.841
It's up to you.

32:10.842 --> 32:14.237
All I know is that
if I keep hating him,

32:14.238 --> 32:16.005
then he'll win.

32:17.606 --> 32:20.949
He'll have taken all my power
and left me a victim.

32:23.421 --> 32:25.392
And I'm not a victim.

32:27.765 --> 32:29.229
So you lost your temper.

32:30.330 --> 32:31.629
You were upset.

32:32.130 --> 32:34.749
If I'd been there,
I would have gone crazy, too.

32:36.669 --> 32:38.709
I don't know what to do.

32:40.198 --> 32:43.345
You know, I love him, but I...

32:43.346 --> 32:46.498
I can't handle what's happening.

32:48.697 --> 32:49.721
I just need...

32:49.722 --> 32:52.345
I need things to
go back to normal.

32:53.214 --> 32:57.896
Why can't everyone just...
Stay themselves?

32:59.537 --> 33:01.697
When you feel better,
maybe the two of you

33:01.698 --> 33:04.758
should just talk
about where you are, you know?

33:04.759 --> 33:06.330
You're in different
places right now,

33:06.331 --> 33:08.722
but maybe you'll be back
in a groove soon.

33:09.425 --> 33:10.762
I hope so.

33:10.763 --> 33:12.273
I love Max.

33:12.274 --> 33:14.408
I think you're good together.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.633
Thanks.

33:27.301 --> 33:28.761
It's okay.

33:29.522 --> 33:31.008
It's me.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.571
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.090
I just want to say,
I should have told you

33:36.091 --> 33:37.715
that Crash was out of jail.

33:38.627 --> 33:40.171
I was wrong.

33:40.172 --> 33:41.499
I apologize.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.648
Thanks.

33:45.606 --> 33:47.151
I just wish I'd have
known he was out.

33:47.643 --> 33:48.827
Yeah.

33:50.182 --> 33:52.687
There's a lot of things that
I should have told you.

33:54.095 --> 33:56.591
You know when you
were kidnapped,

33:56.592 --> 33:58.031
the worst thing about it

33:58.032 --> 34:00.159
was just not knowing what
happened to you.

34:01.047 --> 34:02.856
Were you injured, were you...

34:05.311 --> 34:08.103
But even if it was the worst
news in the world,

34:08.103 --> 34:11.772
all I wanted
to know was the truth.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.899
The truth.

34:34.777 --> 34:36.531
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

34:37.697 --> 34:38.879
Me too.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.847
And I'm really sorry
for upsetting you

34:41.848 --> 34:44.766
and for not checking in with you
about the whole Crash thing.

34:44.766 --> 34:46.782
- I could have done that.
- No, no.

34:46.783 --> 34:47.764
I should have done that.

34:47.766 --> 34:49.437
You don't have to
check in with me.

34:50.925 --> 34:53.085
It just feels like,
I don't know,

34:53.085 --> 34:54.639
we're in two different
places or something.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.129
I know.

34:57.130 --> 34:58.554
I thought I was
a forgiving person

34:58.555 --> 35:01.001
and this whole Crash
thing is just...

35:01.002 --> 35:02.361
Yeah, we can talk about that.

35:02.362 --> 35:03.761
I don't want to talk about it.

35:03.762 --> 35:05.953
Taylor, we are different.

35:07.258 --> 35:08.657
That's what makes us great.

35:08.658 --> 35:10.161
Maybe.

35:10.162 --> 35:11.890
But maybe not.

35:11.891 --> 35:13.378
I...

35:14.257 --> 35:15.265
I don't know.

35:19.834 --> 35:23.281
I think it'd probably
be good if...

35:24.665 --> 35:27.245
If we broke up for a while.

35:29.166 --> 35:31.693
Right?

35:36.493 --> 35:37.661
I guess if...

35:37.662 --> 35:40.333
I really love you, Max.

35:40.334 --> 35:43.565
But you need to do your thing
and I need to do mine.

35:43.566 --> 35:45.170
- Taylor.
- No, I just...

35:46.889 --> 35:49.561
I just wanted you to know
how I was feeling.

35:51.105 --> 35:52.317
Good night.

36:10.857 --> 36:12.113
Everything okay?

36:12.857 --> 36:14.098
No.

36:14.099 --> 36:16.531
Everything is not okay.

36:19.523 --> 36:22.364
I can't tell Elizabeth
about Lori, Carter,

36:22.365 --> 36:23.539
I already told you why.

36:23.540 --> 36:24.723
Okay, but...

36:26.179 --> 36:28.044
You are not giving her a chance

36:28.045 --> 36:30.659
and you're not giving yourself
a chance to get past this.

36:30.660 --> 36:34.035
Dad, this is the lie that
is going to destroy us.

36:34.036 --> 36:36.443
Not my abduction,
not the egg donor stuff,

36:36.444 --> 36:38.211
this one.

36:38.212 --> 36:41.199
You can't just bury
something like this.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.960
If you tell her now,
she might forgive you.

36:43.961 --> 36:45.557
- She won't.
- How do you know that?

36:45.558 --> 36:47.948
Because I can't forgive myself.

36:49.206 --> 36:50.967
It's unforgivable.

36:54.806 --> 36:56.582
Dad, what happened?

36:56.583 --> 36:58.826
Tell me the whole story.

37:00.321 --> 37:01.993
I was having an
affair with David Wilson

37:01.994 --> 37:03.906
when Carter and Taylor
were a year old.

37:03.907 --> 37:05.273
What is your relationship
with Elizabeth Wilson?

37:05.274 --> 37:07.681
Didn't have one.

37:07.682 --> 37:09.367
I only knew what David
told me during the affair.

37:09.368 --> 37:11.152
- Which was?
- He was unhappy.

37:11.153 --> 37:12.728
He wished he'd
never married her.

37:12.729 --> 37:14.115
She destroyed his self esteem.

37:14.116 --> 37:15.459
Made his life miserable.

37:16.618 --> 37:18.499
How did you meet the Wilsons?

37:21.683 --> 37:23.443
I met David in the park.

37:25.259 --> 37:27.156
I don't know where she was.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.755
He was always the one
with the girls.

37:28.756 --> 37:30.891
Hi, looks like you could
use an extra hand.

37:30.892 --> 37:33.011
Yes, actually. If you could...

37:33.012 --> 37:34.371
Ooh.

37:34.972 --> 37:36.898
She's gorgeous.

37:36.899 --> 37:38.532
They both are.

37:38.533 --> 37:41.091
<i>When I asked her
if she lived near us,</i>

37:41.092 --> 37:44.039
<i>she said she was a hospice
worker down the road.</i>

37:44.040 --> 37:45.371
Was that true?

37:45.372 --> 37:47.183
To be honest, I have no idea.

37:47.184 --> 37:48.461
<i>He was miserable.</i>

37:48.462 --> 37:50.496
<i>That's pretty much all
we talked about at first.</i>

37:50.497 --> 37:53.353
But I knew right away,
he needed someone to love him.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.817
<i>I should have known
something was wrong.</i>

37:54.818 --> 37:57.901
She was very needy
and I was vulnerable.

37:57.902 --> 37:59.541
Because you weren't
getting along with mom.

37:59.542 --> 38:00.893
We were disconnected.

38:00.894 --> 38:03.535
On Elizabeth's birthday,
they got into a big fight.

38:03.536 --> 38:05.239
We were supposed to have
a weekend away,

38:05.240 --> 38:07.783
but your mom
and I had a huge fight.

38:07.784 --> 38:09.752
She couldn't bear the thought
of being alone with him

38:09.753 --> 38:10.999
and went to her parents' house.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.399
I called.
I tried to talk to her,

38:12.400 --> 38:15.822
but Joan answered and said
your mom needed space.

38:19.055 --> 38:20.783
Is that when you got
together with Lori?

38:21.216 --> 38:24.225
- So he called me and said we should meet.
- He called you.

38:24.226 --> 38:26.383
I went to the local bar
and there she was.

38:26.384 --> 38:27.759
- Waiting for you?
- I don't know.

38:29.102 --> 38:30.390
I wouldn't put it past her.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.846
The bar, he just unloaded.

38:31.847 --> 38:33.680
I mean, the guy was so unhappy.

38:33.681 --> 38:36.430
He just went on and on about
what a bitch his wife was.

38:36.431 --> 38:39.926
I was unhappy about not getting
along with your mother.

38:39.927 --> 38:42.524
- We were awful to each other.
- It sounds horrible.

38:42.525 --> 38:44.477
It seemed pretty
obvious after that night

38:44.478 --> 38:46.052
that everything would
just fall into place.

38:46.053 --> 38:48.787
Me, him, the girls.

38:48.788 --> 38:51.245
So are you claiming that you
had planned, at this time,

38:51.246 --> 38:53.116
to kidnap one of these children?

38:53.117 --> 38:55.731
God, no. The plan was for him

38:55.732 --> 38:57.401
to leave her
and bring the girls.

38:57.402 --> 39:00.336
I thought that was the last
I'd ever see her.

39:00.337 --> 39:03.263
Did you think she was planning
on taking me then?

39:03.264 --> 39:04.776
She never even mentioned you

39:04.777 --> 39:07.255
or Taylor except to say
you were beautiful,

39:07.256 --> 39:09.016
which you were, but you
have to remember,

39:09.017 --> 39:11.487
this was two years
before you were taken.

39:12.503 --> 39:13.584
We had moved on.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.016
Dad. You have to tell mom.

39:16.017 --> 39:17.712
You just do.

39:17.713 --> 39:19.536
I can't.

39:21.103 --> 39:22.455
Too much has happened.

39:22.456 --> 39:27.087
Every second this lie goes on,
Lori is winning.

39:28.059 --> 39:30.540
She is getting exactly
what she wants.

39:30.541 --> 39:33.324
But maybe if this
is all out in the open,

39:33.325 --> 39:35.428
maybe all of us
could start to...

39:37.813 --> 39:39.995
To get on with our lives.

39:43.124 --> 39:45.259
What if your mother
can't forgive me?

39:47.940 --> 39:49.723
What if she can?

40:03.598 --> 40:05.232
You thought he was gonna
leave his wife?

40:05.233 --> 40:07.527
I know he was.

40:09.416 --> 40:11.447
<i>He promised.</i>

40:58.502 --> 41:00.247
I'm responsible for Carter's kidnapping.

41:00.248 --> 41:01.879
<i>With their dad's affair
with Lori uncovered.</i>

41:01.880 --> 41:03.166
Your father and I are separating.

41:03.167 --> 41:04.999
<i>Is the entire family now at war?</i>

41:05.000 --> 41:08.007
I take after dad, you take after
the not job who is in prison.

41:08.008 --> 41:08.654
Stop it.

41:08.655 --> 41:10.031
I don't want you in my life.
