00:03.269 --> 00:06.238
<i>Hi. And welcome back
to our Tool Time salute...</i>

00:07.774 --> 00:10.538
Ohhhhhh!

00:13.246 --> 00:15.180
...to golf.

00:15.248 --> 00:17.808
Let's get to it.
We have a very special guest for you.

00:17.884 --> 00:21.251
That's right. He's number eight in
all-time earnings on the PGA tour.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.288
He's in town at the Golf Expo.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.382
<i>Let's give a warm Tool Time
welcome to Payne Stewart.</i>

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.569 --> 00:40.096
Thanks for making time
to be on the show. You know...

00:40.173 --> 00:43.939
You'd think with the
kind of cash you're pulling down,

00:44.010 --> 00:46.979
you could afford
the rest of those trousers.

00:47.814 --> 00:51.716
Tim, when you're in the public eye,
you have to have a trademark.

00:51.785 --> 00:56.916
With me, it's knickers.
With you, it's burns and abrasions.

00:59.692 --> 01:02.252
Well, Mr. Stewart,
first things first.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.796
How does one go about
choosing the right driver?

01:04.864 --> 01:07.298
- Well, it depends on your ability.
- OK.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.495
- Now, what's your handicap, Al?
- Tim.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.170
Actually, it's 16.

01:13.273 --> 01:17.175
Then along with a few lessons,
you'll want a driver like this.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.542
- With an expanded sweet spot.
- All right.

01:20.613 --> 01:22.240
Tim, what's your handicap?

01:22.315 --> 01:25.182
Payne, Payne, Payne...

01:25.251 --> 01:29.347
What's a handicap? I think golf is more
of a Zen-like, jujitsu type of thing.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.982
His handicap is 35.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.250
You guys think you're so good?

01:34.360 --> 01:38.524
Why don't we take a shot at my golf
simulator and have a driving contest?

01:38.631 --> 01:40.963
Klaus!

01:41.034 --> 01:44.367
Now, the way that this machine works
is there are sensors in the pad

01:44.437 --> 01:47.895
which measure the velocity
and the striking angle of the club.

01:47.974 --> 01:50.499
The vector and the velocity
is then measured...

01:50.577 --> 01:53.546
Al, shut up and shoot the thing,
will you?

01:53.646 --> 01:56.012
Vector velocities.

02:06.493 --> 02:11.055
<i>Ninety-five yards.
Nice shot, miss.</i>

02:14.734 --> 02:17.669
All right, Payne.
Let's see what you got.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.864
See what we can come up with here.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.752
<i>Two hundred-ninety-one
yards. Nice drive.</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:37.153
Wow. That was a great drive.
Well, I guess this contest is over.

02:37.223 --> 02:41.455
Not so fast.
Heidi, why don't we bring out my driver?

02:41.528 --> 02:44.759
- Here you are, Tim.
- Thank you, Heidi.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.424
- And what would this be?
- I know what this is.

02:48.501 --> 02:52.665
This is a special driver designed for
senior citizens to get more distance.

02:52.772 --> 02:58.039
They don't even have to swing it because
it's got 25 caliber charge in it.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.946
Not anymore.

03:03.116 --> 03:06.142
I bored it out to a 44 magnum.

03:06.219 --> 03:09.780
- That's cheating.
- Welcome to my world.

03:09.889 --> 03:12.255
Stand back, guys.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.627
All right.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.388
Fire in the hole.

03:31.678 --> 03:35.341
<i>You the man.</i>

04:32.605 --> 04:34.368
Where are you going in that shirt?

04:34.440 --> 04:37.603
Well, it's happy hour at The Tiki Hut.

04:37.677 --> 04:43.013
You gotta get there by five o'clock,
or the pupu platter is picked clean.

04:43.082 --> 04:47.815
Do you actually meet women there?
Or just go there to pig out on pupu?

04:47.887 --> 04:50.117
Well, I haven't met anyone yet.

04:50.189 --> 04:53.625
But I'm forming a social network of
people with similar interests.

04:53.693 --> 04:57.459
People who eat dinner off toothpicks
in the middle of the afternoon.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.499
It's a lot of fun.
Why don't you join me for a drink?

05:00.566 --> 05:03.729
I'd like to.
You know how I love fresh pupu.

05:03.836 --> 05:07.738
But Jill's got the flu and I'm stopping
by the pharmacy to pick up medication.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.035
Anything you suggest?

05:09.108 --> 05:11.076
These days I'm strictly homeopathic.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.202
No wonder you're not meeting any women.

05:14.814 --> 05:18.250
If that's how you feel, fine.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.082
Goodnight, Al.
Goodnight, Tim.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.453
- Heidi, is anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

05:24.524 --> 05:25.548
Are you sure?

05:25.625 --> 05:29.254
Well, actually,
Scott and I have separated.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.092
He moved out
a couple weeks ago.

05:31.998 --> 05:36.901
Heidi, I'm so sorry. Why didn't you
say something about this before?

05:36.969 --> 05:39.995
Because I didn't want to bring my
personal problems to work.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.438
Why not?

05:41.541 --> 05:45.307
Because you said, "Don't ever bring
your personal problems to work."

05:45.845 --> 05:47.779
Since when do you listen to me?

05:47.847 --> 05:50.611
Since you said,
"I had better start listening to you."

05:50.683 --> 05:53.550
Nice going, Mr. Compassion.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.179
I might need a little
time off from the show.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.223
- Take as much as you need.
- Thanks.

05:58.324 --> 06:02.021
I gotta go drop off Amy at Scott's.
He's got her this week.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.258
We can't leave Heidi alone
when she's this upset.

06:05.331 --> 06:06.958
Take her to the Tiki Hut.

06:07.033 --> 06:11.766
Well, nothing raises one's spirits
like a fistful of pot stickers.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.864
She doesn't need food.
She needs a shoulder to cry on, OK?

06:14.941 --> 06:18.707
Well, I'm not exactly an
expert on relationships, Tim.

06:18.778 --> 06:24.444
But you're a good friend and you're a
good listener. Come on, do it for Heidi.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.281
- Do it for the show.
- For the show?

06:27.387 --> 06:32.256
If she's too upset to come back, you'll
have to squeeze into one of the skirts.

06:37.530 --> 06:41.591
- Here you go, Mom.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.534
What are you doing with
all these mail-order catalogs?

06:44.604 --> 06:47.630
Now that I'm sick, I finally have
time to look through them.

06:47.707 --> 06:48.867
You gotta see this.

06:48.941 --> 06:52.308
"The World's Best
Earwax Removal System".

06:54.480 --> 06:59.508
And if you act now, they'll toss in
"The World's Best Bunion Scraper".

06:59.719 --> 07:01.084
All right, off we go.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.917
Yeah. We're going to the mall
to pick up some CD's.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.458
You know what? I'll go with you.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.233
Wait a minute.
You don't have to go anywhere.

07:15.301 --> 07:18.737
I've got a music catalog that'll save
you money. Look at this.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.740
Fifteen CD's for a penny.

07:22.975 --> 07:27.309
Well, it sounds great.
But who's Pat Boone?

07:27.380 --> 07:29.746
- We'll be home before dinner.
- OK.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.909
- Hey, guys.
- Hello, Dad.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.678
Well, honey, how are you feeling?

07:35.755 --> 07:39.213
How do I look?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.816
That's what I thought.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.589
- Help is on the way. Look what I got.
- Oh.

07:43.663 --> 07:48.225
Ibuprofen. I got antihistamines.
I got decongestants, analgesics.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.862
I got daytime decongestant.
I've got nighttime decongestant.

07:51.971 --> 07:57.136
You take two of everything here and that
flu'll be out of your system in an hour.

07:57.210 --> 08:01.044
If I take two of everything here,
I'll be dead in an hour.

08:01.113 --> 08:04.082
Think it'll take the whole hour?

08:05.151 --> 08:09.315
- So, how was work today?
- Not so good.

08:09.422 --> 08:13.119
- Heidi's marriage is in trouble.
- What?

08:13.192 --> 08:16.719
- Yeah. She and Scott are separated.
- Oh, my God. That's terrible.

08:16.796 --> 08:19.629
Apparently, it hasn't
been good for quite a while.

08:19.699 --> 08:24.363
Oh, no. I have to call her.
She probably wants a woman to talk to.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.464
It's all taken care of.
She's having dinner with Al.

08:28.541 --> 08:32.307
That's a good question. The show's
about to begin. Enjoy yourselves.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.176
- Heidi?
- Hi, Tim.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.942
I thought you needed time off.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.245
I did, too. But then I
had dinner with Al.

08:38.317 --> 08:42.082
- He put everything in perspective.
- You and Scott getting back together?

08:42.188 --> 08:44.884
I don't know. But I've
made it over this first hurdle.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.619
Al really helped me
get in touch with my rage.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.821
Hm. No one brings out rage
better than Al.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.038
- Good morning, Tim.
- Hi, Al.

09:00.106 --> 09:03.974
I don't know what you talked about with
Heidi. But it did a lot of good.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.774
Well, last night was pretty
incredible for me, too, you know.

09:07.847 --> 09:13.080
We talked about everything from the
weather to intimate details of her life.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.754
Forget the weather.
How about the other stuff?

09:17.857 --> 09:22.521
Well, basically, you know, after Amy
was born, Heidi didn't feel very sexual.

09:22.595 --> 09:26.156
Scott wasrt understanding and that
turned Heidi off to sex even more.

09:26.265 --> 09:29.359
- So they're not... uh...
- No. No. Not for a while.

09:29.435 --> 09:31.995
Huh. But before the baby,
Oh, my God!

09:33.606 --> 09:34.573
What? What?

09:34.674 --> 09:38.440
Well, I've already said too much. I
don't want to betray Heidi's confidence.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.645
- I can respect that.
- OK.

09:41.714 --> 09:46.879
Now, I could guess some things.
If I'm real close, you could just nod.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.978
<i>Everybody know
what time it is?</i>

09:49.055 --> 09:50.989
<i>Tool Time!</i>

09:51.057 --> 09:55.289
That's right. Binford Tools is proud to
present Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor and

09:55.361 --> 10:00.321
Al "The most sensitive guy
in the world" Borland! Woo-hoo!

10:07.406 --> 10:09.431
Good morning.

10:09.508 --> 10:12.875
Good morning.
Wait a minute. Hold on.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.913
Something's different.
Let me guess.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.214
You did something with your hair,
didn't you?

10:19.285 --> 10:24.746
It's a sinus mask. OK? But if it
doesn't work, it's totally returnable.

10:24.824 --> 10:28.988
I'd love to be the
second owner of that thing.

10:29.061 --> 10:32.827
Before you waste more money,
Al's got a bunch of homoerotic remedies.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.365
Why don't I call him?

10:34.433 --> 10:37.493
Speaking of work, how's Heidi doing?

10:37.570 --> 10:41.506
Very well, thanks to Al. And he's
really taking care of her problems.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.838
Heidi must be grateful
to have a friend like Al.

10:45.511 --> 10:49.641
Stay in the shower, Al. I got it.
Good morning. Borland residence.

10:49.715 --> 10:52.775
Uh, wrong number. Bye-bye.

10:54.687 --> 10:59.852
- Who was it?
- It sounded like one of the Muppets.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.056
Is something wrong?

11:03.663 --> 11:07.224
Heidi just answered the phone at
Al's house at 7:30 in the morning.

11:07.299 --> 11:11.793
She must've spent the night there.
Now I feel sick.

11:15.808 --> 11:19.938
Oh, God. Oh, God.

11:20.012 --> 11:25.314
I've got this image
of Al and Heidi.

11:25.384 --> 11:28.148
Get out of my head!
Get out of my head!

11:28.254 --> 11:32.623
Heidi did not sleep with Al.
First of all, she's a married woman.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.786
And second of all, she, she
wouldn't go for a guy like Al.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.624
Her husband is tall and handsome.

11:37.730 --> 11:41.962
I mean, he spends more time at the gym
than Al does at Hickory Farms.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.095
Honey, I'm not saying that it happened.

11:45.171 --> 11:49.232
But I could understand how a woman like
Heidi could fall for a guy like Al.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.798
In what universe?

11:50.876 --> 11:54.209
Women like Heidi have had
the gorgeous hunks.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.910
The second time around, they want
somebody less exciting, more dependable.

11:58.984 --> 12:02.681
Me... I went for number two first.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.556
You don't understand.
You do not understand.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.355
Al is like a dependable
four-door Rambler...

12:09.428 --> 12:12.158
...and Heidi like a
twelve-cylinder Ferrari.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.359
They don't belong in the same garage.

12:15.434 --> 12:18.597
And yet she parked overnight there.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.866
Nothing happened!

12:20.940 --> 12:23.704
But I won't rest until
I find out what's going on.

12:23.776 --> 12:28.110
Oh, Tim. Look, even if they were
parked in the same garage,

12:28.180 --> 12:31.013
you are not their mechanic.
You're just being petty.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.812
Oh, I'm being petty?

12:32.885 --> 12:37.720
Yeah. Why should you be the only
one with an incredibly desirable woman?

12:41.594 --> 12:42.856
- Hi, Al.
- Hey.

12:42.928 --> 12:47.092
Hey, would you help me put my tool belt
on? I just touched up my nails.

12:47.166 --> 12:50.658
- Okey-dokey.
- Thank you.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.673
- Hey.
- Yeah?

12:54.774 --> 12:59.643
I just want to tell you how wonderful
it's been for me these past few days.

13:02.081 --> 13:07.986
Well, it's been pretty incredible for
me, too. You're really a special lady.

13:08.053 --> 13:10.419
Thanks. You have a good show.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.458
- You, too.
- OK.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.057
- Morning, Tim.
- Is it?

13:20.466 --> 13:22.832
Hey! How are you doing, buddy?

13:22.935 --> 13:25.096
Good.

13:25.171 --> 13:29.130
You know, I, uh, called your house this
morning and Heidi answered the phone.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.739
- So, you're Kermit?
- Maybe.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.369
Uh-huh.

13:34.446 --> 13:37.176
Well, anyway,
Jill and I got to talking and

13:37.249 --> 13:40.412
we were thinking that maybe
you and Heidi were...

13:41.020 --> 13:41.987
What?

13:42.087 --> 13:43.054
You know.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.921
Even though I told her that a Rambler
couldn't jump-start a Ferrari.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.687
But, you know...

13:48.761 --> 13:54.700
So you're saying it would be impossible
for Heidi to be interested in Al?

13:55.434 --> 13:59.370
No. I don't believe it.
But other people are talking.

13:59.438 --> 14:02.566
Well, those other people
can think what they want.

14:02.641 --> 14:06.008
Amen. Amen.

14:10.349 --> 14:14.718
But, uh, would those other people
be right or would they be wrong?

14:15.421 --> 14:19.187
Well, Tim, are you asking me
to talk about my personal life at work?

14:19.258 --> 14:23.922
Yes. I think it's about time we
opened up and shared our experiences.

14:24.930 --> 14:28.593
OK. I, uh, I actually have
something I'd like to share.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.498
Let it go.
Don't hold anything back.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.728
The truth is, Heidi and I...

14:32.838 --> 14:34.703
Yeah? Yeah?

14:34.773 --> 14:38.937
...are entitled to our privacy.

14:46.919 --> 14:50.047
There's 40 bucks well spent.

14:50.122 --> 14:55.389
Hey, this happens to be
the world's best tissue disposer.

14:55.461 --> 14:59.397
It shreds, decontaminates,
and deodorizes.

15:03.002 --> 15:06.062
I wonder if it would
work on your meatloaf.

15:08.207 --> 15:10.334
I'll be back in about an hour.
All right?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.376
Where are you going?

15:11.477 --> 15:13.968
I'm gonna go over to Al's
house and do some repairs.

15:14.046 --> 15:17.914
- Dad, it's ten o'clock at night.
- I'm a conscientious landlord, son.

15:17.983 --> 15:22.943
The same landlord who said, "Al, do you
really need heat in February?"

15:24.924 --> 15:29.293
What are you gonna fix
with these binoculars?

15:29.395 --> 15:32.956
That is such an insulting question
I'm not even gonna answer it.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.865
You have sunk this low.
You're gonna go spy on poor Al.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.699
I just don't want him hurt.
I'm gonna need those back.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.069
No. Forget about it.
You're not going there.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.472
There's nothing wrong
with being curious.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.407
You are not curious;
you're obsessed.

15:45.477 --> 15:46.535
I'm not obsessed.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.672
Last night you cried out
their names in your sleep.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.581
And after that I just cried.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.713
It's torture having this image
filling up my brain.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.953
Especially with space
at such a premium.

16:08.434 --> 16:12.302
Ooh. Something smells good out
here, Wilson. What are you doing?

16:12.371 --> 16:15.738
I'm boiling up some sap
for the Michigan Maple Festival.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.972
Speaking of saps, wait till
you hear what Al's been doing.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.980
You don't have to tell me.
I've heard all about it.

16:23.048 --> 16:24.015
What?

16:24.116 --> 16:26.880
What Al told me
is in strictest confidence.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.985
- Well, you know, Wilson...
- Mm-hm?

16:30.055 --> 16:32.683
...I could get you
a riding mower from Binford.

16:32.758 --> 16:35.659
Sixteen-horse rear-bagger
for cost plus ten.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.993
Sorry, neighbor.
I can't be bought.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.725
Why would Al tell you and not me?

16:40.799 --> 16:44.360
Well, maybe because I didn't
search his locker for long brown hairs.

16:45.738 --> 16:51.472
Which, according to the lab, either
belonged to a collie or Al's mother.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.843
Tim, why are you so interested
in Al and Heidi's personal life?

16:55.914 --> 16:59.577
I don't know. I've never cared
about Al's personal life before.

16:59.651 --> 17:03.587
And I've never asked Heidi about hers.
But you put the two of them together...

17:03.655 --> 17:07.182
There's that image again.

17:07.259 --> 17:10.717
Tim, have you ever heard
of the term "cognitive dissonance?"

17:10.796 --> 17:13.924
You know I'm not into politics.

17:13.999 --> 17:17.901
Cognitive dissonance is when pieces of
our lives no longer make sense.

17:17.970 --> 17:22.498
Beliefs we always held true seem to be
false so we reorder our way of thinking.

17:25.676 --> 17:29.340
Are you saying a Rambler
could hook bumpers with a Ferrari?

17:29.415 --> 17:30.746
It's very possible.

17:30.816 --> 17:35.515
No, no. If what you say is true
then everything I believe is false.

17:35.587 --> 17:40.047
- Now, Tim. That's not necessarily...
- Let me go with this for a minute. OK?

17:40.125 --> 17:43.617
This means that maybe cars aren't the
most important thing in the world.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.219
- Ohh...
- No, wait a minute.

17:45.297 --> 17:47.925
Opera's more manly than football?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.901
- Neighbor...
- Al's mother is thin?

17:52.771 --> 17:56.935
Tim, it's not easy to change one's
perceptions. But it can be very healthy.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.510
Some people might say
it's a growth experience.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.341
OK, Wilson. How far does this go?

18:01.447 --> 18:03.938
How do I really know you are
who I think you are?

18:04.016 --> 18:07.383
- How do I know you're who I think?
- How do I know you said that?

18:07.486 --> 18:10.046
- How do I know you heard?
- How do I know you're here?

18:10.122 --> 18:14.889
Who else would have the time to come out
and listen to this silly conversation?

18:17.796 --> 18:20.162
Hey, Al.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

18:20.265 --> 18:21.755
I don't think so.

18:21.834 --> 18:25.964
I'm not gonna feed your appetite for
lurid gossip and tawdry innuendo.

18:26.038 --> 18:30.668
And, by the way,
I installed an alarm on my locker.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.903
I shouldn't have gotten
involved in your personal life.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.744
From now on, your business
is your business, all right?

18:38.417 --> 18:40.282
Well, I appreciate that.

18:40.352 --> 18:44.015
If there's any other part of my life you
want to talk about, I'm an open book.

18:44.089 --> 18:46.614
I'm not much of a reader. Thanks.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.353
- Have a good show.
- OK.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.290
- Good morning, Al.
- How are ya?

18:51.363 --> 18:55.094
- Oh, I feel so great this morning.
- Oh, I feel pretty great myself.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.465
How about Sorentino's
for dinner tonight?

18:57.536 --> 18:59.697
All week long it's
"Fettuccine Madness"!

18:59.805 --> 19:02.171
- I'm afraid I can't make it.
- Why not?

19:02.241 --> 19:07.406
Well, thanks to the things you
said, I saw Scott last night.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.846
And we're gonna get back together.
Isn't that great?

19:10.916 --> 19:15.819
Oh, that's so great! Yes, that's...
Good for you!

19:15.888 --> 19:18.823
- Thanks. I got you a something.
- You didn't have to do that.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.359
- I wanted to. Here.
- Oh, thank you.

19:21.426 --> 19:25.658
I also want to thank you for letting me
sleep on your hide-a-bed.

19:25.731 --> 19:28.359
Well, now I call it the Heidi-bed.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.664
Good.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.570
<i>Oh, it's The Tiki Hut Cookbook!</i>

19:34.640 --> 19:37.666
- Do you like it?
- I love this!

19:37.743 --> 19:39.108
Now I can make pupu at home.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.078
Hey, Al.
Thank you for everything.

19:46.151 --> 19:48.119
Oh, well...

19:48.787 --> 19:53.486
Uh, Heidi... Uh... can I
just talk to you about one thing?

19:53.559 --> 19:54.890
Sure. What?

19:54.960 --> 19:58.623
Well, after that night
you stayed at my house,

19:58.697 --> 20:04.431
Tim got this crazy idea that,
that you and I might have...

20:04.503 --> 20:06.266
How do I say this?

20:06.338 --> 20:09.796
- Slept together.
- Yeah. OK. Yeah, that's it.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.571
And he thought that was impossible

20:12.644 --> 20:15.374
because he doesn't think
a beautiful woman like you

20:15.447 --> 20:19.178
could ever be interested in,
in a guy like me.

20:19.251 --> 20:20.980
Oh, is that so?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.214
Well, let me tell you something, Al.

20:23.288 --> 20:28.453
If I werert married, you're exactly
the type of guy I'd be looking for.

20:33.699 --> 20:38.466
Thank you. I wish,
I wish Tim could hear you say that.

20:39.605 --> 20:43.041
You know, I don't think Tim
really needs to hear anything.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.482
- Howdy, Wilson.
- Hidy-ho.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.523
Not hidy-ho.
Let's talk Heidi-Al.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.756
Tim, are you still
obsessing about that?

21:01.827 --> 21:04.557
Well, I wasrt until today
when I saw Heidi kissing Al.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.497
And no peck on the cheek.
She just drove it home.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.723
- Tim.
- Yeah?

21:09.801 --> 21:11.860
Get a hobby.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.005
Good-night.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.802
I think you're right
about what you said yesterday.

21:16.875 --> 21:21.642
Nothing's right with me. I think I am
suffering from communist discotheque.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.773
Tim, can we chat about this tomorrow?
I am a little busy.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.216
<i>Wilson, where do you keep
a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover?</i>

21:30.722 --> 21:32.451
I gotta get some new friends.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.623
You'd think with all the money
you pull down

21:39.731 --> 21:42.427
you could afford the rest
of those pantaloonies...

21:43.702 --> 21:46.796
<i>You'd think with the money you make...</i>

21:46.872 --> 21:48.999
I have... I have... I have...

21:49.074 --> 21:52.601
I have to say the word
"culottes" just once.

21:52.678 --> 21:56.842
You don't want to be the only one
with a desirable woman.
