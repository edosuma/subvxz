Did that help?

23:18.398 --> 23:21.535
- A little.
You know, can always

23:21.635 --> 23:23.937
depend on my girls.
- Yeah.

make an amazing father.

because of that.

26:01.128 --> 26:04.164

Is it me?

26:04.264 --> 26:06.967

34:34.908 --> 34:37.610
Honestly, he might have
came back just for Andi.

34:37.710 --> 34:39.045
- Okay, well that's a problem.

34:39.146 --> 34:42.081
- Yeah, I know.
See, his practice is

34:42.181 --> 34:45.118
in London, right?
So he must be using his

34:45.219 --> 34:47.654
client's settlement money
or something.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.322
- You got any proof of that?

34:49.422 --> 34:51.824
- No, but I can find out.

34:51.925 --> 34:53.659
- Yeah, yeah, give me any
information you can.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.864
And just... that'll be--
that'll be helpful.

35:09.743 --> 35:11.111
- Just tell me, man.

35:11.211 --> 35:13.747

bought stock.

35:13.847 --> 35:16.316

No, he ain't that lucky.

35:16.416 --> 35:18.418
- Yeah, this is what Jake said.
He's my right-hand man.

35:18.519 --> 35:19.586
He would tell me.

35:19.686 --> 35:21.054
- Hold on, you're shitting

35:21.154 --> 35:23.657

- Yeah.

35:36.670 --> 35:39.173
- Damn.

35:39.273 --> 35:41.275
Look, just have your SEC guys
still look into it

35:41.375 --> 35:42.476

35:42.576 --> 35:44.111
- Man, you really got a
hard-on for this guy.

35:44.211 --> 35:47.514

steal your bike.

Listen, I don't know what

35:52.786 --> 35:53.887

35:53.987 --> 35:55.422
- Yeah, okay.

35:55.522 --> 35:57.324
- Hayden, look, don't be mad.

35:57.424 --> 35:58.759
- No, it's all good, bro.

35:58.859 --> 36:00.394
- All right, look.
I'll talk to my guy

36:00.494 --> 36:01.762
at the SEC, all right?

36:01.862 --> 36:04.031
- That's all I'm asking.
Thank you.

36:04.131 --> 36:07.734
Damn. And uh,
I'll look into this clown, too.

36:07.835 --> 36:09.837

- How'd you do it?

36:27.788 --> 36:29.256
- Robin.

36:29.356 --> 36:30.757
- Oh.

36:30.858 --> 36:33.861
- Yeah, he made two phone calls.

36:33.961 --> 36:37.297
- He's plugged like that?
- Yeah, I guess so.

36:37.397 --> 36:39.333
- Well, Andi, I can't
thank you enough.

36:39.433 --> 36:41.768
- It's fine.
And I think your job

36:41.869 --> 36:43.537
is gonna be fine.
- [sighs] Great.

36:43.637 --> 36:44.838
- Just waiting to hear back
from him.

36:44.938 --> 36:47.074
- Good.
Oh, I need to call Zac.

36:47.174 --> 36:51.078
- Oh, um, about that...

36:51.178 --> 36:53.080
- What?

36:53.180 --> 36:55.716
- Zac got arrested.

36:55.816 --> 36:57.284
- What?

36:57.384 --> 36:59.319
- He came up to the office
looking for you.

36:59.419 --> 37:00.721
- Andi, I told you not
to tell him.

37:00.821 --> 37:03.490
- I didn't.
Hayden did.

37:03.590 --> 37:05.058
- What?

37:05.158 --> 37:06.326
- Yeah.

37:06.426 --> 37:09.663
So Zac proceeded
to beat his ass

37:09.763 --> 37:11.665
all up and down the office.

37:11.765 --> 37:14.434
- Shit!
- Yeah.

37:14.535 --> 37:16.970
But...
- So Zac is in jail now?

37:17.070 --> 37:18.472
- Yeah.

37:18.572 --> 37:20.541
But Robin's gonna help me
get him out, too.

37:20.641 --> 37:24.444
I'm just waiting for
the phone call.

37:24.545 --> 37:25.946
- I just...I don't understand
what I gotta do

37:26.046 --> 37:28.949
to get this -- to leave
me alone.

37:29.049 --> 37:31.118
- I don't know.

37:31.218 --> 37:34.955
- Shit, I hope...
I hope Robin can help him.

37:35.055 --> 37:38.959
- Did you say if he was
still on probation?

37:39.059 --> 37:40.661
- Shit, honestly,
Andi, I don't know.

37:40.761 --> 37:42.062
I don't know if he is or not.

37:42.162 --> 37:45.899
- Okay, 'cause it would help
to have that information.

37:45.999 --> 37:47.801
- Shit.

37:47.901 --> 37:48.936
- It's okay.

37:49.036 --> 37:51.605
How 'bout we just wait here
and, uh, wait

and get my work cell.

37:58.645 --> 37:59.780

It's fine.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.516
- No, but all my contacts
are in that phone.

38:02.616 --> 38:04.618
