Sacramento this is In Focus.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.923
I'm Jessica Cortean.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.558
Critics of genetically
modified crops

00:24.558 --> 00:27.928
say they're a possible threat
to health and the environment.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.430
- [Radio Announcer] You may
not wanna hear about it.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.600
It's scary stuff, but this
threat is ugly and real.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.901
It's not going away.

00:33.901 --> 00:34.868
- [Jessica] This is
not a local problem.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.105
This is a national problem.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.406
- [Radio Announcer]
An inspiring fever

00:38.406 --> 00:40.141

He was diagnosed with advanced
brain cancer four years ago--

00:47.681 --> 00:49.317
- [Radio Announcer]
Among the chemicals

00:49.317 --> 00:52.953
we're exposed to daily are those
that made plastics pliable.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.422
- [Jessica] In Iraq
and Afghanistan

00:54.422 --> 00:56.490

bank and just do it.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.470
Just do what you gotta do.

Just get in the frickin'
bank and just do it.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.925
- Oh, you know just...

02:39.427 --> 02:40.894
It's a bad air quality day.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.030
- Man, it's been a long time no?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.998
Like since high school, huh?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.667
- Mmm, yeah.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.170
- Is the mask for the
arachnephobia thing?

02:51.605 --> 02:54.208
- No no, it's (chuckles)...

02:54.208 --> 02:56.477
It's agoraphobia, actually.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.348
Hey, but I really
gotta get going.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.115

03:04.151 --> 03:07.020
Good seeing you though. (grunts)

03:07.020 --> 03:09.990
- Remember when you
graduated, we graduated man

03:09.990 --> 03:12.192
and you were freakin' out?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.262
My aunt thought you were
a special needs student.

03:14.262 --> 03:17.231
Do you remember that? (laughs)

03:17.231 --> 03:18.065
Oh, man.

03:21.101 --> 03:24.338
- Oh hey, you know
a pack of cigarettes

03:25.973 --> 03:30.077
shortens your life span
by 3 1/2 hours, right?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.446
- Yeah no, I'm cuttin' back man.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.214
I'm cuttin' back.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.250
- Really, that's 7,000
chemical compounds

03:36.250 --> 03:39.720
being created by just
burning the thing.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.856
It's really poison
Scott, seriously.

03:42.856 --> 03:43.691
- Alright.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.261
Do you still live with your mom?

03:47.261 --> 03:48.262
Is she okay?

03:49.697 --> 03:50.531
- Yeah.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.735
Don't litter that
cigarette, please.

Hey, what are you doin'?

04:41.315 --> 04:42.249
Yeah, guess who shut...

04:42.249 --> 04:42.983
Oh shit, hold on a second.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.184
Hey, excuse me.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.686
Excuse me, do you
have any spare change?

04:45.686 --> 04:46.520
Bitch.

04:47.688 --> 04:51.158

have any spare change?

04:51.158 --> 04:53.561
Do you have any spare change?

04:54.995 --> 04:57.264
Do you know what the best
nation in the world is?

04:57.264 --> 04:58.098
- What?

04:58.098 --> 04:58.932
- Dough-nation.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.868
(coins rattling)

05:00.868 --> 05:03.804
- Do you think this is a game?

05:03.804 --> 05:04.705
Huh?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.640
(girl spitting)

05:06.640 --> 05:07.475
(coins rattling)

05:07.475 --> 05:08.308

05:08.308 --> 05:10.077
Give that back!

05:10.077 --> 05:11.311
Hey!
- Fetch.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.613
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

05:12.613 --> 05:13.947
- Really?

05:13.947 --> 05:14.782
- Yeah.

05:15.683 --> 05:16.617
Bitch.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.586
Goddammit, fuckin' bitch!

05:19.987 --> 05:22.656
(horns honking)

05:26.394 --> 05:28.261
(birds chirping)

05:28.261 --> 05:31.264
(suspenseful music)

06:30.658 --> 06:31.492
- [Tracey] Tell
me about your day.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.960
What was big?

06:32.960 --> 06:37.230
- [Chet] Scott was there and
he was really, really annoying.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.533
It was a whole cluster.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.001
- [Tracey] Wow.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.737
You went to the
bank by yourself?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.238
How was it being outside?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.174
- I thought my head
was gonna explode.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.610
- Chet, I think this could
be really good for you.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.112
(baby crying)

06:53.914 --> 06:55.716
(sighs) Sorry.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.018
Send me a text later?

06:58.018 --> 06:59.553
- Okay Trace, kiss
the baby for me.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.054
- Yeah, I will.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.289
Okay, bye.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.892
(horn blaring)

07:12.800 --> 07:14.367
- Ugh!

07:14.367 --> 07:15.736
Ugh!

07:15.736 --> 07:17.204
- We got sideswiped!

07:17.204 --> 07:18.672
They missed us by this much.
- It's insane.

07:18.672 --> 07:19.607
- Yeah the horn is stuck.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.941
The (mumbles) was amazing

07:20.941 --> 07:21.775
That was just crazy.
- Mom, what happened

07:21.775 --> 07:22.710
with the bank?

07:22.710 --> 07:23.644
Why didn't you guys call?

07:23.644 --> 07:24.444
I was waiting all day for you.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.646
- You went to the bank?

07:25.646 --> 07:27.515
That's wonderful Chet,
that's wonderful.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.417
Oh I'm sorry, I thought
it was tomorrow.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.553
Salt Lake's nice, I
think you'll like it.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.621
- Hey, y'all packed?

07:33.621 --> 07:35.055
It's a big day tomorrow.
- No, no!

07:35.055 --> 07:36.490
I can't think.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.425
Why didn't you guys call?

07:38.425 --> 07:40.494
I was waiting all day for you?

07:40.494 --> 07:42.229
- Wait a minute,
you're not packed?

07:42.229 --> 07:43.664
You have to have your
clothes together, honey.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.798
The cleaning crew
was coming tomorrow.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.433
We gotta be outta here, sweetie.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.836
I mean the renter's
coming in a month.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.739
- I can't go with
you guys to Utah.

07:53.941 --> 07:54.775
I can't.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.612
- Wait a minute, I
told you months ago.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.648
You said yes, you agreed.

08:01.749 --> 08:02.916
- I know, I...

08:04.217 --> 08:05.786
I need more time.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.721
It's a big move, can you please

08:07.721 --> 08:09.456
just give me three...

08:10.390 --> 08:12.325
Three more weeks please?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.061
- No, I cannot do that.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.663
I have less than a day, Chet.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.797
You know what I'm gonna do?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.331
You know what I'm gonna do?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.567
I'm gonna return
the renter's check

08:19.567 --> 08:20.801
and you can make it
here on your own.

08:20.801 --> 08:21.969
But you're gonna
have to pay rent.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.136
- No!
- This is gonna be good yes.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.539
This is gonna be good for you.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.974
This will be good for you.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.141
- You okay, Chet?

08:28.141 --> 08:30.778
You want some
water or something?

08:30.778 --> 08:32.011
- What about me?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.280
Who's gonna go to
the supermarket?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.448
What if Meow Meows
has to go to the vet?

08:35.448 --> 08:36.884
- You'll figure it out.

08:36.884 --> 08:37.918
- [Pat] You've got
your disability money.

08:37.918 --> 08:38.986
You're doing some editing.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.121
- That's not the problem.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.289
Mom, can we...

08:43.190 --> 08:44.324
Mom.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.559
Mom!

08:45.559 --> 08:48.028
Mom, can we please
talk about this!

08:48.028 --> 08:48.962
- We're gonna take the Hybrid.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.297
You can have the SUV, okay.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.332
That's it, simple.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.333
Right, where are my glasses?

08:53.333 --> 08:54.702
Have you seen my glasses?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.469
- Here you go, buddy.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.407
- Honey, just give us a minute.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.875
It's (mumbles) getting dramatic.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.243
Listen to me.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.444
Listen to me, come on.

09:04.444 --> 09:07.881
Come up here.
(Chet groaning)

09:07.881 --> 09:09.049
Sweetie, look at me.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.517
Look into my eyes.

09:10.517 --> 09:14.822
I am nearly 60 years old
and I have been trapped here

09:14.822 --> 09:19.192
in this house with you
for the last 10 years.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.862
We need to grow, the both of us.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.765
- Do you even know what
I went through today?

09:24.765 --> 09:26.266
Do you want me to die.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.001
I have to stay inside; I
don't have a choice, mom.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.436
Please.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.171
- The first 30 days are
gonna be the hardest.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.139
You can do it.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.573
(foreboding music)

09:33.573 --> 09:34.675
- I should have known
you'd pick your new husband

09:34.675 --> 09:35.508
over your son.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.744
I'm so stupid!

09:36.744 --> 09:37.945
So stupid.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.880
- You know that is not true!

09:39.880 --> 09:41.081
You know what you
need to breathe.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.249
Do you wanna meditate?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.216
Because we can
meditate right now.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.151
- No!
- You need to meditate.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.418
- Please don't.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.155
- You know, I can't always be
the wall that protects you.

09:48.155 --> 09:51.491
You gotta learn how
to protect yourself!

09:54.662 --> 09:55.495
(soft music)

09:55.495 --> 09:56.764
- There you go.

09:57.865 --> 09:58.699
- Francis.

09:59.566 --> 10:00.400
- Maggie.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.172
- Ten letter word for
professional liar.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.675
- Who are the top three liars?

10:07.675 --> 10:10.678
- Who are crack dealers, car
salesmen, and the president.

10:10.678 --> 10:11.611
- Aha, there you go.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.880
Try politician.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.784
Hey, I need my van back.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.454
Sharon is on my
ass about that van.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.224
Stop shampooing your hair
in the damn ladies' room.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.393
It's clogging up the drain.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.560
- What's this?

10:28.428 --> 10:30.330
- This is milk thistle.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.701
It's for detoxing
your foul liver.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.035
- Whiskey for fucking me up.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.569
- No!

10:36.569 --> 10:39.206
Your boyfriend, Dr Oz,
swears by that stuff.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.607
Take it.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.442
- What does he say
about your gunt?

10:42.442 --> 10:45.879
- Gunt, what's that?
- Excuse me?

10:45.879 --> 10:48.916
- Nothing now--
- G-U-N-T, gunt!

10:48.916 --> 10:51.518
- Nothing, it's nothing.

10:51.518 --> 10:54.321
- Eat it!
- Lighten up, Francis.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.057
(siren blaring)

10:57.057 --> 11:00.127
(soft, somber music)

11:21.915 --> 11:25.518
(prison door lock buzzing)

11:43.670 --> 11:46.706
- Sorry it's been so long, hon.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.540
- 90 days.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.445
- Where's your wedding ring?

11:52.445 --> 11:54.047
- I had to pawn it.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.584
It's just a ring, babe.

11:58.786 --> 12:02.189
(sighs) It's good to
finally see you, hon.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.957
Are you taking your inositol?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.558
- What's the point?

12:06.827 --> 12:07.694
It doesn't work.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.596
No, screw it.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.630
I'm not taking that.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.564
- Hey brother.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.299
Hey Maggie, how ya doin'?

12:12.299 --> 12:13.700
- Hey Rego.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.104
(Rego and Rick mumbling)

12:19.439 --> 12:21.208
So how ya been, babe?

12:22.275 --> 12:23.510
- Really good.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.779
I found a new public
assistance lawyer

12:25.779 --> 12:29.182
that might take
your case pro bono.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.018
- It's four years now.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.222
I'm the one that's supposed
to be locked up here, not you.

12:35.222 --> 12:39.659
Rego thinks that maybe God
put me on this new path.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.428
- God didn't put you in here.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.765
Two assholes that lied and
testified against you did.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.868
- No, he saved me.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.701
I mean it.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.538
I thought about hurtin' myself.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.307
I thought about
just checkin' out

12:57.010 --> 12:59.046
- Have you talked
to the prison psych?

12:59.046 --> 13:01.048
(Rick laughing)

13:01.048 --> 13:04.952
(muffled background crosstalk)

13:14.594 --> 13:17.197
- [Ann] My God, this
room is so tiny.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.266
You should take my room.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.100
- I know.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.138
I'm not a little kid, mom.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.240
- Okay.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.980
I found these in the trash.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.682
Why aren't you taking your meds?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.584
Does this affect your
ability to have an erection?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.419
- Mom, just don't talk
about my penis, okay?

13:39.419 --> 13:40.653
- Oh now why not?

13:40.653 --> 13:41.955
I used to clean it and you used

13:41.955 --> 13:43.190
to pee on me--
- Mom, please stop talking.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.791
- When I would change you.

13:44.791 --> 13:45.893
Well you did.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.597
- I don't like living
in a fog, okay.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.838
I'm fine, I've got Tracey.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.540
- You have neighbors.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.977
Reach out to them.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.753
- I just want you to be happy.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.657
Just go be happy.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.327
(Ann chuckling)

14:24.731 --> 14:28.902
(Ann singing in
foreign language)

14:52.292 --> 14:53.693
- Okay.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.862
- Oh honey, it'll be okay.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.666
It'll be okay.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.702
(soft, somber music)

15:11.344 --> 15:14.747
(Chet breathing heavily)

15:21.154 --> 15:23.991
(water trickling)

15:28.261 --> 15:29.262
- [Woman On Radio] They
are your loved ones,

15:29.262 --> 15:30.530
neighbors, and friends.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.832
They've served in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

15:32.832 --> 15:36.036
For many, re-entry into civilian
life can be challenging.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.304
- [Man Over Radio]
Jayda Roberts,

15:37.304 --> 15:38.771
an Army Reservist
and case manager,

15:38.771 --> 15:41.841
says that returning vets
miss their service routines.

15:41.841 --> 15:45.112
So Dry Hooch offers vets
different ways to cope.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.246
- [Jayda] What we come home to

15:46.246 --> 15:49.582
is not a very
structured environment

15:49.582 --> 15:51.151
like we're used to.

15:59.492 --> 16:03.596
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

16:07.434 --> 16:10.137
- Meow Meows.
(cat toy rattling)

16:10.137 --> 16:11.071
Meow Meows.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.677
Meow Meows (sighs).

16:17.677 --> 16:20.347
You better not be outside again.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.982
- [Dr Green] Hi
Chet, Dr Green here.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.751
You missed several sessions now.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.786
This new issue you're developing

16:26.786 --> 16:28.021
with the breathing outside is

16:28.021 --> 16:29.822
really troubling me
and I really think

16:29.822 --> 16:32.359
we need to address your
agoraphobia as well

16:32.359 --> 16:33.493
as this new issue.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.328
Please call my office.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.632
(phone ringing)

16:41.401 --> 16:44.037
- Hey, I was just
thinking about you.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.105
- Hey Tracey.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.341
You wanna come over today?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.909
Just hang out?

16:49.909 --> 16:51.711
You can bring the baby.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.113
It's been months.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.450
Tracey, you there?

16:57.450 --> 17:00.287
- I, I don't know
how to say this.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.257
I feel really bad, but
Roger doesn't want me

17:04.257 --> 17:06.959
to come over there anymore.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.328
He says it's not
safe for the baby.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.730
I told him that was silly.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.199
- He said that?

17:12.199 --> 17:14.300
You kidding me?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.069
Roger went to school with
me since fourth grade.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.470
You guys know me.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.006
- He just thinks you're
depressed and maybe unbalanced.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.742
And I told him
you were my first.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.114
- You told him?

17:29.349 --> 17:32.119
(gurgling water)

17:35.522 --> 17:38.725
(lively country music)

17:38.725 --> 17:39.892
Room for rent.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.595
Cheap rent in
exchange for favors.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.165
No.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.233
no.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.235
(keyboard clicking)

17:48.235 --> 17:51.904
In exchange for personal
assistant services.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.045
Room for rent.

17:59.045 --> 18:03.183
Cheap rent in exchange for
personal assistant services.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.552
So this is the room.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.887
- Yeah, it doesn't look bad.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.025
How much per month is the rent?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.796
- Researching is my
hobby. (chuckles)

18:16.796 --> 18:18.765
Sorry, I'm nervous.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.933
- Oh no, you're fine.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.869
What kind of research do you do?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.871
- The environment.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.374
The poisons we put into
it that are killing us

18:27.374 --> 18:30.577
and all the spraying in
the sky and all this stuff.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.280
Did you refill that?
- Yeah, I recycle.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.316
- Do you know how much
BPA, fluoride and germs

18:36.316 --> 18:39.986
and aluminum that you're
drinking right now?

18:40.987 --> 18:43.223
(Marcella laughing)

18:43.223 --> 18:45.057
- So I get a break
on the rent if I go

18:45.057 --> 18:46.493
to the grocery store,
the post office--

18:46.493 --> 18:47.760
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.598
Basically anything that
involves going outside.

18:51.598 --> 18:54.201
We should start a
book club together.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.635
I've got a...

18:55.635 --> 18:57.704
My room is right on the
other side of yours,

18:57.704 --> 19:01.073
so anytime you wanna talk,
you just knock knock.

19:01.073 --> 19:01.908
- Okay.

19:03.776 --> 19:04.977
- That's my living room.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.614
It's really nice; you're
gonna be impressed.

19:07.614 --> 19:11.818
We just got a fireplace
here and the back door.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.988
Personally I think television
destroyed the family unit

19:17.123 --> 19:21.528
and the ability for
people to really connect

19:21.528 --> 19:24.096
and develop deep relationships.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.767
People need to share,
to eat together, talk.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.504
- You're gay, right?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.339
- Um, no.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.607
No, I'm not.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.079
- Well just so we're clear,

19:40.079 --> 19:42.815
I am in a committed
relationship.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.084
- Chet!

19:46.219 --> 19:48.054
Oh my God, Chet.
- Hey.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.391
Have we met?

19:51.391 --> 19:54.261
- Last time I saw you I
was like eight years old

19:54.261 --> 19:55.662
with buck teeth.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.163
Janice Dmytryk's daughter.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.399
My mom was BFF's with
your mom, remember?

19:59.399 --> 20:00.933
- Valentina?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.535
- Yes. (chuckles)

20:02.535 --> 20:05.372
- Wow. (chuckles)

20:06.373 --> 20:09.242
You grew up really beautiful.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.210
- Pretty lucky, huh?

20:11.210 --> 20:14.614
- So I saw the post online
and I wanted to surprise you.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.883
So I used another name.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.587
Surprise! (laughs)

20:20.587 --> 20:22.555
I love your rock star hair.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.957
It's perfect. (chuckles)

20:24.957 --> 20:28.227
- Thanks, I didn't even wash it.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.364
- Chet and I are
practically cousins.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.900
Are you here for the room too?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.402
- Better watch out for this one.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.470
She looks like jail bait.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.646
- Let me get you an application.

20:46.646 --> 20:47.814
- Oh, awesome.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.517
Can I see the room?

20:50.517 --> 20:52.852
- Yeah yeah, right this way.

20:54.954 --> 20:58.958
- I totally don't mind
running errands or anything.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.059
I can totally drive you.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.060
This one?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.595
Oh perfect!

21:02.595 --> 21:04.096
I can totally drive you to
the mall anytime you like.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.599
- [Chet] Well that's actually
the last place I'd wanna go.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.067
- How are you?
- Good.

21:08.067 --> 21:11.070
(muffled crosstalk)

21:19.779 --> 21:21.180
- (mumbles) Maggie.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.482
- Hey sugar tits.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.884
Hey, what's with the glass?

21:24.884 --> 21:26.519
- Sorry, we're outta stems.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.956
- Okay, you need
to wash them, okay.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.392
Rex knows what kind
of glass to use.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.827
Did Rex even make this?

21:34.827 --> 21:38.264
'Cause a dry Manhattan is 1
1/2 ounce Canadian whiskey,

21:38.264 --> 21:42.369
3/4 oz dry vermouth
and a dash of bitters.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.202
No ice.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.206
- It;' just like the other
seven that you drank.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.675
- No, no it's not.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.777
'Cause if you pour all
these ingredients over ice,

21:50.777 --> 21:53.346
you will not have a Manhattan.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.647
You'll have something else.

21:54.647 --> 21:58.117
It might be tasty, but
it's not a Manhattan.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.752
- It has everything
to do about race.

21:59.752 --> 22:00.720
It's racism.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.556
You know what a scalp is?

22:03.556 --> 22:04.891
- Yeah, I know what a scalp is.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.793
- It's a bloody scalp.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.895
That's what it means, man.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.062
You guys don't get it.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.465
They're disrespecting my skins.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.266
What do you mean your skins?

22:14.266 --> 22:15.635
What does that mean?

22:15.635 --> 22:19.739
- My skins, my brothers. (yells)

22:20.707 --> 22:22.475
- Hey hey, Cochise!

22:22.475 --> 22:24.977
You wanna keep it down?

22:24.977 --> 22:28.047
- (laughs) Hey
Marine, you alright?

22:28.047 --> 22:30.182
- Fan fucking tastic.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.585
Here drink up.
- Oh yeah!

22:32.585 --> 22:33.586
Oorah!

22:33.586 --> 22:36.689
(soft country music)

22:38.925 --> 22:40.092
- What's wrong with your mouth?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.628
- I don't know.

22:41.628 --> 22:45.264
It's either a canker
sore or herpes.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.899
You want me to go down on you?

22:46.899 --> 22:49.736
(Maggie groaning)
(Francis laughing)

22:49.736 --> 22:51.237
You check out that
room for rent?

22:51.237 --> 22:56.008
- Yeah, some teenage little
skank is gonna get it.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.411
Fuck it, I'm fine in the van.

22:59.345 --> 23:00.146
- The van?

23:01.047 --> 23:03.082
You mean my van?

23:03.082 --> 23:05.752
That I need back please, Maggie.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.488
I don't like you sleepin'
on the parking lot anyway.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.856
- If your girlfriend
didn't hate me,

23:09.856 --> 23:12.191
maybe I could rent from you.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.699
(door knocking)

23:19.699 --> 23:20.967
- Hey.
- How are you?

23:20.967 --> 23:21.901
Hey cousin.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.209
- Val, I thought I told you

23:30.209 --> 23:31.611
I need at least a day to decide.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.514
- You would not believe
the day that I've had.

23:34.514 --> 23:37.116
I just thought we had a
real connection you know?

23:37.116 --> 23:39.586
Honestly my grandparents
are driving me crazy.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.555
So is it cool if I stay here
for like a night or two?

23:42.555 --> 23:44.457
Do you have any asprin?

23:44.457 --> 23:48.628
Oh and if you hate me, you can
totally kick me out tomorrow.

23:49.629 --> 23:50.797
- Um.
- Please?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.534
- (stammers) Yeah we can

23:54.534 --> 23:58.104
I guess do a one
night test drive?

23:58.104 --> 23:59.071
- Yeah, no problem.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.172
I will be the perfect roommate.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.040
You'll see.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.980
* I wish you'd stay right here

24:07.980 --> 24:10.282
- Do you need a place to stay?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.383
- Nope.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.719
- Really?

24:12.719 --> 24:16.055
'Cause I heard you
need a place to stay.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.894
Why don't we arm wrestle, huh?

24:21.894 --> 24:25.264
You win, you can stay
at my place tonight.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.499
What'd you say, huh?

24:26.499 --> 24:29.335
(Maggie spitting)

24:30.870 --> 24:34.373
- (chuckles) I like that.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.777
I'm White Eagle.

24:37.777 --> 24:42.348
- His name is Hector and
he's a Cuban from La Puente.

24:42.348 --> 24:43.883
- Half Cuban.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.952
The other half is Lakota.

24:47.119 --> 24:50.056
- Look, Bald Eagle
or whoever you are,

24:51.257 --> 24:54.026
I'm not here to
get fucked, okay?

24:55.962 --> 24:59.031
- Why you so pissed off, huh?

24:59.031 --> 25:02.068
'Cause your husband
is in the joint?

25:02.068 --> 25:03.235
Yeah, I heard.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.575
It must be tough
knowin' your old man

25:08.575 --> 25:12.745
is takin' it up the
ass, huh? (laughs)

25:14.681 --> 25:18.350
Aww, did I hurt your
feelings, soldier girl?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.055
Fuckin' bitch!

25:24.223 --> 25:27.193
(Maggie laughing)
(muffled crosstalk)

25:27.193 --> 25:28.327
You fuckin' bitch!

25:28.327 --> 25:29.528
Let me at her.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.496
Let me fuckin' (mumbles).

25:30.496 --> 25:33.499
(muffled crosstalk)

25:36.468 --> 25:38.037
- Back the fuck up!

25:38.037 --> 25:39.271
- Throw her outta here.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.374
Get off me, man.
- (mumbles) fuck!

25:42.374 --> 25:43.309
- Throw her out, man.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.577
Throw her out.
- Alright.

25:44.577 --> 25:45.444
Look I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:45.444 --> 25:46.579
I'm sorry guys, okay?

25:46.579 --> 25:47.880
Look, it was me okay.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.182
Okay look, hey,
I'm buyin' a round.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.383
Okay?

25:51.383 --> 25:52.318
I'm gonna buy a
round for us, okay.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.753
- You cool?
- Yeah.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.622
(hand smacking)
(White Eagle yelling)

25:55.622 --> 25:56.422
Bitch!

25:57.456 --> 25:58.691
Big lipped bitch!

25:58.691 --> 26:00.593
Little bitch, you call
yourself an Indian.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.061
You motherfucking (mumbles).
- Fuckin' bitch.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.864
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

26:04.864 --> 26:05.932
Do you wanna get hurt?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.533
Is that it?

26:07.533 --> 26:08.801
- Did you hear what he said?

26:08.801 --> 26:10.436
- I don't care, I
don't give a fuck.

26:10.436 --> 26:13.773
I am done caring,
do you understand?

26:13.773 --> 26:15.074
- Goddammit, throw
her outta here!

26:15.074 --> 26:16.508
- Sit down!
- Get the fuck outta here.

26:16.508 --> 26:20.246
- No, I'm tired of you
treating me like shit.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.283
I'm just good ol' Fran
who's gonna be here for you

26:24.283 --> 26:25.251
no matter what?

26:25.251 --> 26:26.753
Is that the deal?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.287
Well guess what, Maggie.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.822
It works both ways.

26:29.822 --> 26:33.993
- No Frannie, (stammers)
I'm sorry, okay.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.563
- Get the fuck outta my bar.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.978
- So Valentina, I
noticed you wrote down

26:54.213 --> 26:56.315
self-employed on
your application.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.149
- Yeah.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.352
Darn, is that a zit?

27:00.352 --> 27:02.722
Can you see that?
- No I...

27:02.722 --> 27:04.490
I don't see anything.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.296
Val, do you have a job?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.397
- Yeah of course.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.598
Of course.

27:12.598 --> 27:13.265
I mean if you don't like
a little test drive,

27:13.265 --> 27:14.566
it's no problem.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.404
- Look, why don't you
come back tomorrow

27:18.404 --> 27:21.841
and we can talk about
this with your mom.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.677
- You're thinking about

27:24.677 --> 27:26.478
what that snooty lady
said, aren't you?

27:26.478 --> 27:28.447
You can check my ID if you want.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.281
Here.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.317
Go ahead.

27:36.188 --> 27:40.359
(yawns) I am absolutely bushed.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.594
I should really get to bed.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.766
Living with my grandmother
and grandfather,

27:46.766 --> 27:48.600
it is absolutely hell.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.704
They treat me like
I'm Cinderella.

27:51.704 --> 27:52.972
When I told them
that I found a place,

27:52.972 --> 27:54.707
they got so mad.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.042
I mean honestly.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.812
It's like my granddad
makes me clean the house

27:59.812 --> 28:02.114
and feed my grandma,
change her old lady diaper.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.382
It is so gross.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.485
No wonder my mom ran away.

28:12.424 --> 28:16.362
Anyway, I really do have
a good part-time job.

28:16.362 --> 28:20.532
I just got started, so your
place is perfect. (chuckles)

28:39.518 --> 28:42.088
We can do it in the
butt if you'd like.

28:42.088 --> 28:45.624
I just wanna stay a virgin
until I get married.

28:45.624 --> 28:48.194
What, we're not really cousins.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.363
- I'm gonna go to bed.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.233
Have a good night.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.710
- Sweet dreams, Chet.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.713
- Yeah, goodnight.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.091
(ominous music)

29:26.132 --> 29:27.466
- Oh this is it.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.469
Look, all the fuckin' tape.

29:30.469 --> 29:34.273
Fucking black fucking
curtains and shit.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.275
Gimme that fuckin' shit.

29:37.676 --> 29:38.510
(mumbles) bitch.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.345
Here bitch.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.212
- Shit, get me in.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.214
Hello.
- Who's there?

29:42.214 --> 29:44.583
(muffled crosstalk)

29:44.583 --> 29:47.253
(Sam and White Eagle laughing)

29:47.253 --> 29:49.388
- Fuckin' get in here.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.289
- Showtime.
- Get the fuck outta here.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.723
I got a gun.
- Hey.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.260
I'm gonna get you.
- I'm not fuckin' around.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.294
You don't wanna test me.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.829
- Oh I don't wanna test you?

29:56.829 --> 29:58.230
I don't wanna test you?

29:58.230 --> 30:00.332
You don't wanna fucking
test White Eagle!

30:00.332 --> 30:02.601
(grunts) Get me in there!

30:02.601 --> 30:03.535
(car rattling)

30:03.535 --> 30:05.071
- [Sam] Hey, baby.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.638
- [White Eagle] You think
you're fuckin' tough, huh?

30:06.638 --> 30:09.141
(mumbles) something
tough now, huh?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.276
Why don't ya come out here?

30:10.276 --> 30:12.044
Come out here now, huh?

30:12.044 --> 30:13.212
Come out here!

30:15.681 --> 30:16.615
Let me in!

30:16.615 --> 30:17.850
Oorah, oohrah.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.351
Come on, soldier girl.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.354
(grunts) Don't fuckin' test me.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.289
(car door banging loudly)

30:23.289 --> 30:24.590
- [Sam] Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.192
(car tires screeching)

30:26.192 --> 30:28.961
(sinister music)

30:41.908 --> 30:43.275
(birds chirping)

30:43.275 --> 30:44.810
- I hope I didn't wake you.

30:44.810 --> 30:45.912
I don't mean to be pushy,
but I was just wondering

30:45.912 --> 30:47.713
if you found someone yet.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.982
- Actually, I'm kinda

30:49.982 --> 30:51.717
still figuring things out.

30:51.717 --> 30:54.353
Kinda doin' a trial period.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.322
- No we're not.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.823
- Val, I told you.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.127
- Why did you let
me stay the night?

31:01.127 --> 31:02.861
That makes no sense.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.096
Were you high?

31:04.096 --> 31:04.763
Now you're trying
to kick me out?

31:04.763 --> 31:05.764
- No, no, I...

31:08.067 --> 31:08.968
Okay, fine.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.004
- [Valentina] Do you
have any Fruit Loops?

31:12.004 --> 31:13.005
- [Chet] No.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.411
- It's nice seeing you again.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.785
Aren't you going to leave?

31:26.785 --> 31:27.619
- No, I don't think so.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.622
(soft guitar music)

31:33.993 --> 31:34.826
- Chet!

31:37.129 --> 31:37.964
Chet!

31:44.136 --> 31:44.971
- Okay.

31:46.939 --> 31:49.275
This is part of your duties.

31:51.310 --> 31:54.480
These are my fingernails
and toenails.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.085
- What does that have
to do with your disease?

31:59.085 --> 32:00.019
- I don't know.

32:00.019 --> 32:00.852
I get nervous.

32:00.852 --> 32:01.853
I save them.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.024
My mom had to sneak out
the last jar I filled

32:05.024 --> 32:06.525
when I was asleep.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.894
So go ahead.

32:08.894 --> 32:11.063
Take care of these
when I'm asleep.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.432
That's part of the job.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.666
- I am not leaving

32:14.666 --> 32:16.635
and I am not touching
your gross nails.

32:16.635 --> 32:20.139
- You'd better not
piss this guy off.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.640
He might chop you up.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.709
- You're both disgusting.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.017
- I'm sorry.

32:31.017 --> 32:32.985
I hope it didn't freak you out.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.320
- Oh no, no, no.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.788
What do you think?

32:36.788 --> 32:37.990
We gonna do this?

32:37.990 --> 32:40.326
- You sure you wanna
live with an agoraphobic

32:40.326 --> 32:43.195
environmentally
obsessive weirdo?

32:43.195 --> 32:44.830
- I'm in.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.432
Thanks.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.900
Hey, um, do you
mind if I put my van

32:48.900 --> 32:49.868
in your garage?

32:49.868 --> 32:51.803
I'm having engine trouble.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.672
- Sure, no problem.

32:53.672 --> 32:54.806
- Do you want me to take this

32:54.806 --> 32:57.343
to the dumpster for you?
- No, no, no.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.177
I got it.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.929
- They say that dog
is man's best friend,

33:17.929 --> 33:19.731
but in this story it turns out

33:19.731 --> 33:22.134
that a cat earned that title.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.502
Jessica Gomez of Pasadena

33:23.502 --> 33:26.172
was unloading groceries
from the family car

33:26.172 --> 33:28.940
when she was attacked
by a pit bull.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.077
Apparently Ralphie
the family dog

33:31.077 --> 33:33.379
and Chewy the family cat
were also in the front yard--

33:33.379 --> 33:36.482
- You must be a local
news junkie, huh?

33:36.482 --> 33:39.485
Four, five, six and
11 o'clock news.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.021
- Yeah, I just like
to stay current.

33:43.021 --> 33:47.259
- There's a really great
website I like for news.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.461
It's the only truthful
reporting around.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.963
I'll give you the web address.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.470
Oh, do you think
you could gimme...

33:59.705 --> 34:01.440
This is the shopping
list and some cash.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.574
Do you think you could
go in a day or two?

34:02.574 --> 34:04.410
- Sure, not a problem.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.380
(muffled TV conversation)

34:14.253 --> 34:16.021
- So you're a Marine?

34:17.255 --> 34:19.190
- Yeah, I was a Marine.

34:20.626 --> 34:21.460
- Oh.

34:25.697 --> 34:28.300
- Has anyone ever told you
you look like that actor?

34:28.300 --> 34:30.469
The guy in the movie Mask.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.239
- (chuckles) You think
I look like Jim Carrey?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.542
- No no no, that's The Mask.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.210
Mask was the one with Cher.

34:38.210 --> 34:41.313
She plays a biker chick
and she has a teenage son.

34:41.313 --> 34:45.251
He's got hair like yours
and a fucked up face.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.418
He's deformed.

34:48.187 --> 34:52.358
Sorry, I mean you look like
him like if he wasn't deformed.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.427
- Yeah, yeah, no...

34:55.427 --> 34:58.096
(Chet mumbling)

35:04.370 --> 35:08.540
Yeah you look like no one
deformed or otherwise too.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.112
- [News Reporter] This is Lauren
Casey reporting to you live

35:14.112 --> 35:17.283
from Pasadena for Action 3 News.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.785
(dog barking)

35:22.988 --> 35:24.990
- Thanks for goin' to the store.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.792
- Receipt's in the bag.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.428
Hope you don't mind
me using your stuff.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.129
- No, no problem.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.799
- I like the way you've
got your kitchen organized.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.268
- My mom was a head nurse.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.536
Very organized.

35:40.906 --> 35:44.176
I'm gonna make some
turkey chili tomorrow.

35:44.176 --> 35:45.711
You can have some if you like.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.913
I mean if you wanted to have
dinner with me or on your own,

35:47.913 --> 35:49.080
either way.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.317
- Sure, we can have dinner.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.786
Hey, I hate to ask
but do you mind

35:54.786 --> 35:56.688
if I borrow your SUV tomorrow?

35:56.688 --> 35:58.557
It's my uncle's birthday.

35:58.557 --> 36:01.059
He's in a rest home and
it's a three hour drive.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.594
I'll bring it back
with a full tank.

36:02.594 --> 36:03.762
- Sure, no problem.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.030
- Cool, thanks.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.965
- No no no no no, stop.

36:08.467 --> 36:11.036
Next time you go to
the store could you try

36:11.036 --> 36:13.339
and not get anything
in a plastic container?

36:13.339 --> 36:14.340
- Sure, why?

36:15.374 --> 36:17.276
- Ever hear of BPA?

36:17.276 --> 36:18.644
- No, like HPV?

36:18.644 --> 36:20.779
- No no, see this jar?

36:20.779 --> 36:22.314
Bisphenol A.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.715
Most of the items
at your supermarket

36:23.715 --> 36:26.618
are in containers
that contain BPA.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.722
Basically anything that
stores food and beverages.

36:30.722 --> 36:34.293
It has estrogen mimickers
and is linked to cancer,

36:34.293 --> 36:35.794
diabetes, obesity.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.835
- Hope I don't get tit cancer.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.942
- I don't think you should
come see me any more.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.378
I want a divorce.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.914
It's not fair to you.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.216
Hey, I'm not getting outta here.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.050
I'm not the same.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.652
- Yes, you are.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.120
You're my man.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.355
Nothing will change that.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.957
- Maggie, I almost let
a guy go down on me

37:05.957 --> 37:08.860
after I got released
from solitary.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.864
- Okay?

37:12.864 --> 37:14.766
- Listen, I went a
little crazy in there.

37:14.766 --> 37:18.570
It's like being buried
alive 23 hours a day.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.272
When they released me
back into the gen pop,

37:20.272 --> 37:22.040
I couldn't even talk.

37:23.609 --> 37:26.278
(ominous music)

37:33.785 --> 37:37.122
One night, my cell
mate this jerk Dallas

37:40.792 --> 37:43.161
he thinks I'm asleep.

37:43.161 --> 37:46.498
He gets up in the
middle of the night

37:46.498 --> 37:48.266
and I know what he wants

37:48.266 --> 37:52.438
'cause he's had the hots for
me ever since I got in here.

37:53.639 --> 37:54.740
Are you okay?

37:55.674 --> 37:56.508
- Yeah, I'm fine.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.344
I wanna hear it.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.946
- I pretend I'm asleep.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.615
He put his hand down my skivvies

38:04.783 --> 38:08.086
and started playing
with my dick a little.

38:09.254 --> 38:12.858
I pretended it was you
and me in bed together.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.693
I started to get hard,

38:15.861 --> 38:18.464
then I realized
what I was doin'.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.932
I jumped up and I
growled somethin' at him.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.534
I scared him shitless.

38:22.534 --> 38:26.204
He goes back to his bed and
I just laid there in the dark

38:26.204 --> 38:27.706
trying not to cry.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.308
I'm disgusting.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.479
You think so too, Maggie.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.080
You think I'm disgusting
too, don't you?

38:35.080 --> 38:38.450
You do.
- I understand it's hard okay?

38:38.450 --> 38:39.685
I don't care if you need to get

38:39.685 --> 38:43.054
licked, sucked or fucked
in here to stay alive.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.756
You're gonna stay...

38:44.756 --> 38:46.224
Wait!

38:46.224 --> 38:47.359
You need to stay strong.
- You need to remain seated.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.094
- He's a decorated war vet.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.429
- Remain seated!

38:53.164 --> 38:55.834
(Rick laughing)

38:58.203 --> 38:59.805
- You still got it.

39:03.875 --> 39:07.946
You'd break me outta here,
if you could wouldn't you?

39:07.946 --> 39:12.117
- I'll break your neck if you
ever talk like that again.

39:17.523 --> 39:20.526
(soft guitar music)

39:26.398 --> 39:31.369
- [Chet] And then all of a
sudden she runs off with Pat

39:31.369 --> 39:34.205
and she won't even
talk to me now.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.044
Are you sure you're okay?

39:39.044 --> 39:39.878
- Hmm?

39:41.980 --> 39:43.048
It's just...

39:43.048 --> 39:44.215
It's my uncle.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.119
It was hard seein' him.

39:48.119 --> 39:52.357
He just looks older and
I'm just worried about him.

39:52.357 --> 39:53.459
He's changed.

39:57.262 --> 39:59.665
- Change can be good.

39:59.665 --> 40:00.999
- Yeah, I guess.

40:02.834 --> 40:07.739
- Well, it's gotta be rough
living in a rest home.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.042
It's sorta like
prison for old people.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.745
I hear it's pretty common
for old men to escape

40:13.745 --> 40:16.915
and try to go back
to their old lives.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.452
Maybe you can move
him to a better home.

40:20.452 --> 40:21.953
- Maybe.

40:21.953 --> 40:26.792
- Hey, I was thinkin' if you
wanna move into my mom's room.

40:26.792 --> 40:30.962
It's the biggest room, you
can go ahead and do that.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.436
(sniffs) Wait, do
you smell that?

40:38.436 --> 40:39.671
What is it?

40:39.671 --> 40:40.506
It smells like a fart.

40:40.506 --> 40:41.339
(Maggie laughing)

40:41.339 --> 40:42.574
That's so gross.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.611
You gotta see a
gastroenterologist.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.178
(Maggie farting)

40:47.178 --> 40:49.214
Really, come on.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.816
Oh that's so gross.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.320
That's so gross.

40:57.188 --> 41:00.125
(foreboding music)

41:46.872 --> 41:49.541
(wall rumbling)

41:56.014 --> 41:57.215
- Maggie?

41:57.215 --> 41:59.618
(wall knocking)

41:59.618 --> 42:00.418
You okay?

42:06.357 --> 42:09.761
(vacuum whirring loudly)

42:13.531 --> 42:14.432
Hey.
- Hey.

42:16.702 --> 42:17.703
- Wow, look at you.

42:17.703 --> 42:20.271
You look really nice.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.106
- I look stupid.

42:21.106 --> 42:22.540
It's old.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.809
I got a job interview.

42:23.809 --> 42:24.743
I just wanna make
a good impression.

42:24.743 --> 42:25.977
- Great.

42:25.977 --> 42:26.912
Hey, good luck.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.413
- Yeah, thank you.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.202
(SUV revving)

42:57.575 --> 43:00.545
(inquisitive music)

43:47.592 --> 43:50.228
- So, what happened first?

43:50.228 --> 43:54.332
- Okay, well like I said,
them two bikers come in

43:55.433 --> 43:57.769
and they're yellin'
at the clerk.

43:57.769 --> 44:00.706
They dragged the little
clerk over the counter

44:00.706 --> 44:04.275
and that's when Maggie's
man yells at them bikers

44:04.275 --> 44:06.411
to leave the little clerk alone.

44:06.411 --> 44:08.714
- [Jerry] So Rick Mosey
was in the store already?

44:08.714 --> 44:10.148
- Yup.

44:10.148 --> 44:14.252
That's when this big hairy
biker came at him with a knife.

44:14.252 --> 44:16.087
Six inch, serrated blade.

44:16.087 --> 44:18.223
Starts waving that
thing around in his face

44:18.223 --> 44:20.125
and he says "Fuck off!"

44:21.693 --> 44:23.361
First they attacked the clerk

44:23.361 --> 44:25.196
and then they
attacked her man Rick.

44:25.196 --> 44:26.097
I've seen it.

44:26.097 --> 44:26.932
- Freeze!

44:27.799 --> 44:28.800
Do not move!

44:31.369 --> 44:32.437
Don't even think about moving.

44:32.437 --> 44:33.705
Boom!

44:33.705 --> 44:36.407
- He had to protect
hisself, so he did.

44:36.407 --> 44:38.910
- So gimme more details.

44:38.910 --> 44:42.914
(Mountain Mike sighing heavily)

44:48.720 --> 44:51.823
- I had to call for air support.

44:51.823 --> 44:55.660
Now, that's the only
thing I could do.

44:55.660 --> 44:56.895
There was nothin' else to do.

44:56.895 --> 44:58.529
We're surrounded
by the oil rigs,

44:58.529 --> 45:03.301
burning oil rigs and the
smoke taking (sighs)...

45:03.301 --> 45:05.904
taking sniper fire in the back.

45:10.641 --> 45:11.476
Oh shit.

45:14.179 --> 45:18.683
I slammed him in the head
with a can of dog food.

45:18.683 --> 45:21.119
- Mike sometimes
confuses things a little.

45:21.119 --> 45:24.990
He was injured in
the first gulf war.

45:24.990 --> 45:26.157
- That's okay.

45:27.058 --> 45:29.594
So Mike, I wanna talk to Maggie.

45:29.594 --> 45:34.165
Can you just step outside
in the hallway for me?

45:34.165 --> 45:35.733
It'll just be a minute.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.602
Take these with ya.

45:37.602 --> 45:39.170
I can't use 'em.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.172
She'll just be a minute.

45:43.174 --> 45:46.511
So that's your big
surprise mystery witness?

45:46.511 --> 45:48.379
I can't help you because you are

45:48.379 --> 45:49.680
obviously lying
for your husband.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.116
- No, no, no I'm not.

45:51.116 --> 45:53.551
- This guy is a fake.
- Nope.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.287
- Yes, he is a fake.
- No he's not, listen--

45:56.287 --> 45:57.222
- I don't have time.

45:57.222 --> 45:58.756
- Listen, the clerk was afraid.

45:58.756 --> 46:03.028
- I'm guessing you met him
at some vet medical facility

46:03.028 --> 46:04.395
or somewhere on the street?

46:04.395 --> 46:07.532
- He lied about Rick
to the cops, okay?

46:07.532 --> 46:08.566
Mountain can free Rick.

46:08.566 --> 46:10.001
- No Mountain can't free anyone.

46:10.001 --> 46:12.170
Mountain doesn't know
what planet he's on.

46:12.170 --> 46:13.404
- For four years I've
tried everything.

46:13.404 --> 46:14.672
- One lie doesn't
justify another,

46:14.672 --> 46:15.706
alright?
- I've tried social media,

46:15.706 --> 46:17.909
private investigators, lawyers.

46:17.909 --> 46:19.444
I've drained my savings.

46:19.444 --> 46:20.678
- I don't have time for...

46:20.678 --> 46:21.746
Okay listen, you're
gonna have to go.

46:21.746 --> 46:23.214
- Please, I've borrowed money

46:23.214 --> 46:25.884
that I can't pay back to people.

46:27.385 --> 46:28.386
I didn't know what else to do.

46:28.386 --> 46:29.988
- Shh, here it is.

46:29.988 --> 46:33.324
Your husband is not
getting out of jail.

46:34.960 --> 46:39.130
If you do not move on, this
will destroy your life.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.966
This will destroy you.

46:41.967 --> 46:45.136
(soft soothing music)

46:55.847 --> 46:56.681
- What?

46:57.849 --> 46:59.517
No, that's bullshit.

47:01.252 --> 47:02.653
No!

47:02.653 --> 47:04.322
They cannot do that.

47:05.223 --> 47:06.057
No!

47:08.459 --> 47:09.527
Are you kidding me?

47:09.527 --> 47:12.030
They just had him in solitary.

47:13.664 --> 47:14.665
Is Rick okay?

47:14.665 --> 47:16.834
- Yeah he's fine, he's fine.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.803
He got into some kind of
scuffle with his celly.

47:18.803 --> 47:20.071
- The cocksucker?

47:20.071 --> 47:21.672
What happened, did
he come onto him?

47:21.672 --> 47:23.274
- I don't know what happened.

47:23.274 --> 47:26.744
All I know is there was
a fight over somethin'

47:26.744 --> 47:29.180
and Rick got 45
days in the hole.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.282
- What am I supposed to do?

47:31.282 --> 47:34.685
I can't see him, I can't
talk to him for 45 days.

47:34.685 --> 47:35.820
What am I supposed to do?

47:35.820 --> 47:36.955
- I don't know
Maggie, I don't know.

47:36.955 --> 47:39.057
Everything's gonna be alright.

47:39.057 --> 47:40.558
It's in God's hands now, okay?

47:40.558 --> 47:41.826
- Terrific.

47:41.826 --> 47:45.496
Terrific 'cause he's
doin' a bang-up job.

47:45.496 --> 47:48.433
Look, I gotta go Rego, I
can't take this any more.

47:48.433 --> 47:49.367
This just sucks.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.236
- Everything's gonna be alright.

47:51.236 --> 47:52.770
I'll watch over him in here.

47:52.770 --> 47:54.339
It's gonna be fine.

47:55.706 --> 47:59.410
Just be strong out there,
hang in there okay?

47:59.410 --> 48:00.445
- I gotta go.

48:02.013 --> 48:05.183
(mellow guitar music)

48:41.719 --> 48:43.188
- I thought you might be hungry.

48:43.188 --> 48:46.824
There's some toast and fruit
out here if you want it.

48:48.293 --> 48:49.127
OJ, too.

48:52.297 --> 48:56.134
Well if you get hungry,
the tray's right here.

49:23.828 --> 49:26.231
(door knocking)

49:26.231 --> 49:30.401
Maggie, hey I know you're
going through something.

49:32.003 --> 49:36.174
I've been going
through something for
10 years or longer.

49:39.844 --> 49:43.748
I started getting
anxiety when I was a kid

49:43.748 --> 49:46.784
and I didn't tell
anyone about it.

49:46.784 --> 49:50.188
I started hurting
myself, cutting myself.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.158
I'm just really worried
about you right now

49:53.158 --> 49:56.327
and I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

50:00.598 --> 50:04.769
I'm here and I can listen
if you wanna talk, okay?

50:07.805 --> 50:09.374
Did you hear me?

50:09.374 --> 50:11.042
- Yeah, I heard you.

50:14.079 --> 50:14.912
Thanks.

50:19.284 --> 50:22.019
Thank you, I appreciate that.

50:22.019 --> 50:22.853
- Yeah.

50:24.055 --> 50:25.223
You scared me.

50:31.762 --> 50:35.400
You should try meditation,
I can show you how.

50:35.400 --> 50:37.735
- I don't need to mediate.

50:37.735 --> 50:39.537
I need a drink.

50:39.537 --> 50:40.971
You want a drink?

50:41.939 --> 50:44.075
- You mean a drink drink?

50:44.075 --> 50:44.909
- Yeah, you got anything?

50:44.909 --> 50:45.743
I'm out.

50:47.178 --> 50:49.247
- Well yeah, my mom she left
behind a lot of alcohol.

50:49.247 --> 50:50.081
You can have some.

50:50.081 --> 50:50.915
What do you like?

50:50.915 --> 50:51.816
- Anything.

50:52.750 --> 50:53.584
- Now?

50:54.985 --> 50:57.655
- Here's to staying positive
and testing negative.

50:57.655 --> 51:00.525
(glasses clinking)

51:04.095 --> 51:05.396
What do you think?

51:05.396 --> 51:06.897
- Yeah, I like it.

51:06.897 --> 51:07.732
It's tart.

51:09.100 --> 51:09.934
I like it.

51:11.969 --> 51:12.970
What's that?

51:14.772 --> 51:17.575
- Tequila and triple
sec straight up.

51:17.575 --> 51:18.876
Then we freeze it for later.

51:18.876 --> 51:21.646
It's my signature drink.

51:21.646 --> 51:23.814
- What's it called?

51:23.814 --> 51:26.050
- Nasty Fuckin' Bitch.

51:26.050 --> 51:29.720
- (chuckles) This is weird.

51:30.821 --> 51:33.023
Isn't this weird?

51:33.023 --> 51:34.024
- Slow down.

51:36.394 --> 51:38.729
So why can't you go outside?

51:42.099 --> 51:44.202
- Why do people think?

51:44.202 --> 51:46.471
People think I can't go outside.

51:46.471 --> 51:48.005
I go outside.

51:48.005 --> 51:51.108
I have good days
and I have bad days.

51:52.710 --> 51:55.480
- Well I thought you were
afraid of goin' outside.

51:55.480 --> 51:57.515
- I'm not afraid.

51:57.515 --> 51:58.449
I'm just...

52:00.285 --> 52:01.886
How do I explain it?

52:03.654 --> 52:07.392
You know how some
people get paralyzed

52:07.392 --> 52:10.161
when they have to give a speech?

52:10.161 --> 52:13.464
Well I get these
crushing waves of panic

52:13.464 --> 52:17.568
when I'm out in public or
if I'm preparing to go out.

52:17.568 --> 52:19.069
My safe zone has a

52:21.406 --> 52:24.175
tendency to
fluctuate on its own.

52:29.514 --> 52:32.450
Come on, let's go outside.

52:32.450 --> 52:34.485
- Well now you're cured.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.620
All you needed was some booze.

52:35.620 --> 52:38.389
(Chet chuckling)

52:49.166 --> 52:52.937
(Chet grunting and coughing)

52:57.275 --> 52:59.109
- That's a strong one.

53:01.646 --> 53:03.481
You make me feel safe.

53:10.421 --> 53:11.256
- To me.

53:17.428 --> 53:19.163
- Wow, that's strong.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.133
Okay.

53:23.133 --> 53:25.002
- Maybe we should save the
rest for tomorrow night.

53:25.002 --> 53:25.836
- Oh, you think I'm drunk?

53:25.836 --> 53:26.671
(Maggie mumbling)

53:26.671 --> 53:27.505
I'm barely buzzed.

53:27.505 --> 53:28.739
- No, you're drunk.

53:28.739 --> 53:32.510
- I'm not drunk, I
weigh more than you.

53:32.510 --> 53:33.511
Here.

53:33.511 --> 53:35.145
To Nasty Fuckin' Bitches.

53:35.145 --> 53:35.980
- Hoorah.

53:49.294 --> 53:52.129
He's in for life,
my husband Rick.

53:53.731 --> 53:54.565
- Prison?

53:57.167 --> 54:00.004
That must be hard
for you and him.

54:00.004 --> 54:01.472
- To life.

54:01.472 --> 54:02.307
- L'chaim.

54:03.341 --> 54:05.643
(Chet hurling)

54:05.643 --> 54:09.814
- (groans) I
should've cut you off.

54:10.981 --> 54:14.752
- No, no, this is how I
should feel every day.

54:14.752 --> 54:17.187
Alive with people and just...

54:19.924 --> 54:22.993
(Chet hurling)

54:22.993 --> 54:27.465
(laughs) I think I just
vomited out of my nose.

54:27.465 --> 54:29.467
- I can't believe you
don't have any aspirin.

54:29.467 --> 54:32.069
- I think I vomited
out of my nose.

54:32.069 --> 54:33.571
- Here, come here.

54:36.807 --> 54:39.377
Didn't you ever drink
before in high school?

54:39.377 --> 54:40.578
- No.

54:40.578 --> 54:41.412
No!

54:42.613 --> 54:46.216
My doctor had me on
hardcore shit, man.

54:46.216 --> 54:48.553
Just panic disorder meds.

54:48.553 --> 54:51.522
Stuff made me down
on myself, man.

54:51.522 --> 54:53.424
It took away my boner.

54:53.424 --> 54:55.426
Fuck that, I like booze.

54:57.495 --> 54:59.163
Let's have another shot.

54:59.163 --> 54:59.997
- Cheers.

55:00.965 --> 55:01.799
- That's not a shot.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.468
- Take it, drink it.

55:10.307 --> 55:13.077
- Mmm that tastes
like Halloween.

55:16.246 --> 55:17.715
(Chet hurling)

55:17.715 --> 55:19.450
- Chet, never again.

55:22.319 --> 55:25.456
- Hey Maggie, what's goin' on?

55:25.456 --> 55:27.625
Later, Frannie.
- Alright.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.632
So what, d'you
bring back my van?

55:34.632 --> 55:36.300
- No.

55:36.300 --> 55:39.203
Sorry, I just didn't
wanna risk it.

55:40.405 --> 55:44.041
Guess you heard
about White Eagle?

55:44.041 --> 55:44.875
- Uh, no.

55:46.611 --> 55:49.046
He was in here a
couple days ago.

55:49.046 --> 55:50.448
- He's alive?

55:50.448 --> 55:52.016
- Yeah, he's alive.

55:53.250 --> 55:56.053
Well okay, he rolled in here

55:56.053 --> 55:58.623
on a wheelchair but he's alive.

55:59.624 --> 56:00.825
He's banged up.

56:03.327 --> 56:05.262
Shit, what did you...

56:05.262 --> 56:06.096
You know what?

56:06.096 --> 56:07.965
I don't wanna know.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.133
Just sit down.

56:14.238 --> 56:16.441
- Did the police come?

56:16.441 --> 56:17.274
- No.

56:20.478 --> 56:25.215
- He probably doesn't want me
to tell my side of the story.

56:25.215 --> 56:27.084
- Well when I asked
him what happened,

56:27.084 --> 56:28.486
he told me some bullshit story

56:28.486 --> 56:32.457
about some drunk vatos
ran him over with a car.

56:32.457 --> 56:34.291
Oh, so that was you.

56:34.291 --> 56:35.493
Okay, you know what?

56:35.493 --> 56:37.261
You should stay away.

56:38.262 --> 56:39.096
- Yeah.

56:43.701 --> 56:45.836
About that night--

56:45.836 --> 56:48.005
- Just forget about it.

56:48.005 --> 56:51.175
We'll just move forward, okay?

56:51.175 --> 56:52.209
How are you doin'?

56:52.209 --> 56:53.043
You doin' good?

56:53.043 --> 56:54.912
You look good.

56:54.912 --> 56:55.980
- Thanks.

56:55.980 --> 56:57.815
Yeah, things are okay.

56:59.016 --> 57:00.618
- Good.

57:00.618 --> 57:02.687
- No no Frannie, I can't.

57:04.388 --> 57:06.824
- Jesus, Lord get over yourself.

57:06.824 --> 57:10.995
I'm looking for a
condom, okay? (laughs)

57:12.497 --> 57:13.330
Here.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.667
I owe you for your last week.

57:19.003 --> 57:20.671
Take it.

57:20.671 --> 57:22.507
Put it in your pocket.

57:23.708 --> 57:24.542
Don't

57:26.043 --> 57:27.578
spend it

57:27.578 --> 57:28.979
on alcohol, okay?

57:30.915 --> 57:31.749
- I won't.

57:32.683 --> 57:33.518
Thanks.

57:35.653 --> 57:37.054
- You're welcome.

57:45.663 --> 57:47.832
Get outta here, devil dog.

57:56.741 --> 57:57.675
- [Radio Announcer]
Could you describe

57:57.675 --> 57:58.943
what was going on with you

57:58.943 --> 58:02.112
and why you wanted
help at the time?

58:02.112 --> 58:04.615
- [Caller] I'm very depressed.

58:06.851 --> 58:11.021
I was always very uncomfortable
in social situations.

58:11.956 --> 58:13.958
Extremely uncomfortable.

58:17.227 --> 58:18.629
- Chet?

58:18.629 --> 58:19.463
Chet?

58:21.131 --> 58:22.667
You dumped the trash?

58:22.667 --> 58:24.635
- Yeah, no big deal.

58:24.635 --> 58:27.605
- Uh no, when you do
go out to get the mail

58:27.605 --> 58:29.239
or to dump the trash,
it's sprint out

58:29.239 --> 58:31.842
and back in as soon as possible.

58:31.842 --> 58:34.579
Here you all are
casual and shit.

58:35.580 --> 58:36.413
Damn.

58:38.382 --> 58:40.551
- You going to the market?

58:41.451 --> 58:44.622
- Yeah, you need something else?

58:44.622 --> 58:46.190
- You goin' to the Food
Emporium across town

58:46.190 --> 58:47.658
or the Super City Shopper?

58:47.658 --> 58:48.993
- Food Emporium.

58:50.427 --> 58:52.963
Did you wanna go with me?

58:52.963 --> 58:54.464
- Yeah, I was thinkin' about it.

58:54.464 --> 58:55.600
- Yeah?

58:55.600 --> 58:58.368
Come on, I could
use the company.

58:59.737 --> 59:01.906
- Yeah but I have to create
a video file right now

59:01.906 --> 59:04.575
for a client so maybe next time.

59:11.816 --> 59:14.819
(soft guitar music)

59:31.301 --> 59:32.737
- Maggie, Maggie!

59:33.604 --> 59:34.905
(both chuckling)

59:34.905 --> 59:36.607
- Do you mind me
workin' out here?

59:36.607 --> 59:38.242
- No, no.

59:38.242 --> 59:41.411
Here, it's called Gladiator.

59:41.411 --> 59:42.780
A lot of people think
that's where the idea

59:42.780 --> 59:44.682
for Superman came from.

59:45.549 --> 59:46.617
- Philip Wylie.

59:46.617 --> 59:49.219
Okay thanks, I'll check it out.

59:49.219 --> 59:50.387
- Cool.

59:50.387 --> 59:52.690
- Hey, you ever box?

59:52.690 --> 59:53.523
- No.

59:54.625 --> 59:56.060
- You wanna learn something?

59:56.060 --> 59:58.128
- Hey can we just do
it not in the face?

59:58.128 --> 59:59.563
I don't wanna get
ringworm or anything.

59:59.563 --> 01:00:01.265
- It's clean, you're
not gonna get ringworm.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:02.833
- Do you sanitize this
thing after every use?

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.835
- Yes, I'm a clean person.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:07.071
(Maggie grunting)

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.605
There.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.440
- Wow this feels like pretty
macho stuff to have on, huh?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.942
(gloves clashing)

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.110
- It's just to protect your face

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:13.944
so if somebody
comes at you like--

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.445
- No no no!

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.348
(chuckles) Ha ha ha, okay.

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:19.984
- I'm just playin'.

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:22.987
Okay, so this is
your proper stance.

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:25.589
Okay?

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:28.693
Left is your jab, right
hand is your power.

01:00:28.693 --> 01:00:32.029
You're gonna put your
left foot forward.

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:36.934
Now you wanna stay strong,
but don't lock your legs.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:37.768
- Okay.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.211
- Alright, now throw the jab
and your wrist like this.

01:00:49.914 --> 01:00:51.148
Snap the wrist.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.617
Snap it.
- Alright.

01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:55.152
- Snap it.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:57.621
Good.
- So, why boxing?

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.456
- My husband got me into it.

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:00.390
Yeah?

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:01.726
That's pretty macho for a girl.

01:01:01.726 --> 01:01:03.327
- One, two.
- One, two.

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.863
- There you go, now just
keep repeating that with me.

01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:07.297
- Hey, how long
were you in Iraq?

01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:08.999
- I did two tours.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:12.837
You look like a robot,
just relax, relax.

01:01:12.837 --> 01:01:15.572
Yeah, yeah, loosen up some.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:17.975
Relax, be light on your feet.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.445
- Did you ever see
anyone get killed?

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.714
- What do you think?

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:25.515
- I don't know, did you?

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:28.352
- Yeah, I saw four
friends get blown to bits

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:31.789
by some lady with a bomb
strapped under her burka.

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:33.457
- I'm sorry I asked.

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:38.929
Were you there when it happened?

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:39.764
- Yup.

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:44.802
It could've been me.

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:48.505
I searched Iraqi
women for explosives.

01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:50.908
Those fuckers were sending women

01:01:50.908 --> 01:01:53.243
with bombs across checkpoints

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:57.748
and you never knew if
somebody was taped up or not.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:02:00.384
Sometimes I wish I was still in.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.190
Right, lemme see that jab again.

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:10.861
You watch any sports
like NFL, MMA?

01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:13.130
- Yeah, I watch MLG
Pro-circuit sometimes.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.331
- MLG?

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:16.500
- Major League Gaming.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.802
- I should punch you
in the vag for that.

01:02:17.802 --> 01:02:19.837
- Hey, you better not.

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:20.670
- Ooh.

01:02:21.806 --> 01:02:24.174
- (laughs) See?

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:25.709
You need to practice your boxing

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:27.444
or somebody's just gonna--
- Okay let's go, let's go.

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:28.312
Oh, you pushed me.

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:29.513
Alright, let's go.

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.782
Let's go, you wanna go?
- I got you in the--

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:33.217
- Let's go, I'll
pop you in the head.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:34.551
- Okay, I was just kidding,
I was just kidding.

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:35.719
I was just kidding.

01:02:35.719 --> 01:02:38.923
- (groans) You
look like a retard.

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:39.857
Let's go.

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:40.791
- No no no, don't get serious.

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:41.959
Don't get serious.

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.094
I don't want to,
I don't want to.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.997
(soft rock music)

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:51.501
You're ripped.

01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:55.505
- I try. (grunts)

01:02:57.741 --> 01:02:59.509
- Can't do this.
- I'm used to it, don't worry.

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:00.945
You're doin' good.

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:05.015
(both laughing)

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.917
- Get up all the way,
all the way, all the way.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:07.751
Good job.

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:08.585
Almost.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.890
(phone beeping)

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:17.995
- Wake up.

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:21.598
You fell asleep.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.802
- I fell asleep?
- Yeah.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.571
- [Radio Announcer] We have
been asking more questions

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:32.076
as a society and the answers
are often extremely disturbing.

01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:34.945
There's a whole PR
industry that sanitizes

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:37.047
what we know about our food.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:38.949
So I needed to
have Mr Genowitz on

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:41.952
to tell us a little bit
about the pork industry

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:44.754
and specifically we're going
to be looking at the story.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:48.926
(soft rock music)
(muffled lyrics)

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:07.411
- Here you go.

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:08.245
Thanks.

01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:28.532
- Hey, what about these?

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:30.467
Found them in the garage.

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.736
- Christmas lights?
- Yeah.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:35.705
Just trust me.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.918
That's you?
- Yeah, that's me.

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:49.653
- You look like a little peanut.

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:52.189
(Chet chuckling)

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:54.258
- That's Valentine's Day.

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:57.494
That's my grandfather.

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:59.329
My first panic attack.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:03.133
You'll like this one though.

01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:06.503
- Oh my God, what are you doing?

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.340
- [Chet] That's a
little hotel room show.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.275
- [Maggie] Who's this?

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:13.110
- [Chet] That's my mom and dad.

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:15.045
- She's pretty.
- Yeah.

01:05:16.981 --> 01:05:19.649
(Chet grunting)

01:05:21.085 --> 01:05:23.153
- What is that?

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:24.254
- Don't know.

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:27.091
- Your back muscles
aren't used to the boxing.

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:28.325
C'mere, c'mere.

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:34.364
(Chet grunting and chuckling)

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:36.266
You like that?

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.567
- Uh huh.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:38.768
- You like that shit
too, don't you? (laughs)

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.704
- Hey (laughs), stop!

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:42.106
Come on, stop.

01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:43.407
(both laughing)

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:46.510
- You slut. (laughs)

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.513
- You. (laughs)

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:52.282
- Tell me more
about your family.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.217
- You tell me.

01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:54.151
You never tell me anything.

01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:56.086
Where do your parents live?

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:59.956
- (scoffs) My dad ran
off when I was born.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.625
Mom's in Nevada.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.427
Got one sister, Grace.

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:04.594
She's a bitch.

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:08.398
They don't talk to me anymore.

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:09.233
- Why?

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:12.536
- A million reasons?

01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:16.040
My mom didn't want me to
join the Marines, strike one.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.576
She didn't want me to
marry Rick, strike two.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:23.013
Then he went to prison and
I refused to divorce him.

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:25.049
(Maggie's mouth popping)

01:06:25.049 --> 01:06:27.217
- Sorry that must be hard.

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:31.488
- Rick's PTSD was getting worse

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.990
so I decided not to re-enlist.

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:37.361
Maybe start a family.

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:45.535
- Good hands.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.573
Sleep good tonight.

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:55.245
- You're good.

01:06:55.245 --> 01:06:56.180
- I got it.

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:04.454
- Yeah well, goodnight.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:05.289
- Night.

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.995
- [Operator VO] An inmate
from the Chino Men's

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.630
Correctional
Facility is calling.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:15.232
- Rick?

01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:16.666
You out of solitary?

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.602
- Yeah babe, it's been 45 days.

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:20.237
Did you forget?

01:07:20.237 --> 01:07:21.671
- No no no no no,

01:07:23.307 --> 01:07:24.541
I was sleeping.

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:27.311
Sorry.

01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:29.213
(Rick coughing)

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:30.046
- Hold on.

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:35.585
- Are you okay?

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:37.387
You're not smoking
again are you?

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:38.488
- Listen babe,
this is important.

01:07:38.488 --> 01:07:39.956
Listen to me.

01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:41.825
Listen, I've been
praying real hard

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:43.127
since you were here last time

01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:44.394
and I remember all
the things you told me

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.363
about staying strong
and being strong.

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.998
I've been prayin' to
God and guess what babe?

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.234
He spoke to me.

01:07:50.234 --> 01:07:53.570
He spoke to me through
a guard in solitary.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.739
I was in my cell
and the guard came

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.907
to deliver a meal
tray, he opens the slot

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.243
and he looks right through it.

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:02.846
He looks right at me and
he says, listen to this.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:07.050
He says, "The Lord
wants me to let you know

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:10.554
"that everything's
going to be okay.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:11.788
"That you're on the right path."

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:13.557
Do you believe that?

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:16.059
- Yeah, that sounds great babe.

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:19.828
- Then I got out of solitary
yesterday and I saw Rego.

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:22.631
Rego comes up to me and
Rego says, "Hey, man,"

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:26.203
he goes, "My aunt, she's
got a diner and guess what?

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:28.872
"They're hirin' a new waitress."

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:31.575
It's in town right nearby babe.

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:33.277
So you got a job,
you can come up here.

01:08:33.277 --> 01:08:34.310
You can be with me.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.746
Come on, we lost the house.

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:38.247
There's nothin' there for you.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.483
You can come up here.

01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:42.752
You'd just be right
here, be near me.

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:44.287
We can file more appeals.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.223
We'll file more appeals
'cause God's with us now.

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.090
We can do this.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:48.057
We can make this work.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:49.792
We can be strong now.

01:09:00.504 --> 01:09:01.970
- [Maggie] Get in.

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.841
Took you long enough.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.243
- Sorry.

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:09.078
- Are you okay?

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.479
- No, can I help you?

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.314
- Listen to this.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.482
The engine sounds funny.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.149
(engine whirring)

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.419
- Easy, don't mess up my car.

01:09:15.419 --> 01:09:17.086
- Okay, just listen.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.292
- Just sounds like my engine,
I don't hear anything.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:23.493
- Okay, hold on.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:26.863
I'm gonna pull forward
just a little bit.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.300
- Just sounds like
you're accelerating.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.435
(engine whirring)

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:33.270
Hey.

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:35.904
Hey!

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:36.740
Whoa!

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:40.009
- You've been wanting
to do this, Chet.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.377
I've seen it on you, okay?

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:42.946
Relax, relax.

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.247
- You tricked me?

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:46.416
- Look, you're fine okay?

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.684
Just breathe.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.185
- I don't want to
breathe out here.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.254
Are you kidding me?

01:09:50.254 --> 01:09:52.656
- Look just calm down, relax.

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:55.292
- Don't touch me!

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:56.125
God!

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.060
- Just relax!

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.295
- I'm getting out of the car.

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:00.730
- Okay yeah good
luck, break a leg.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:03.233
(eerie music)

01:10:08.272 --> 01:10:10.006
- Where are you
taking me right now?

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:11.241
- The mall.

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:13.310
- I am not gonna go to the mall.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.644
I am not gonna go to the mall.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:15.579
Are you kidding?

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:16.313
I'm not gonna go to the mall.

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:17.146
Stop!

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:18.682
Pull over, pull over!

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:20.016
- Come on! Get the...

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:22.051
You wanna get us both killed?

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.753
Jeez, breathe.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:26.656
(foreboding music)

01:10:36.032 --> 01:10:37.734
- Ooh.
- Dammit, wrong way.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.269
- Well go back then.
- No.

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:42.439
- Please, just go back.
- Jesus, calm down.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:43.540
- Turn that off!

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.808
I'm gonna puke.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:49.613
I'm gonna puke, I'm gonna
puke, I'm gonna puke.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:51.781
- Alright, get it
out, get it out.

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:54.784
Alright, I'm stopping,
I'm gonna stop.

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:56.185
There look, okay?

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.490
You're fine, just breathe.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.493
(Chet panicking)

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:05.729
- Get it out, there you go.

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:10.199
- I--

01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:18.475
- Relax.

01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:21.077
You're fine, you're okay.

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:22.446
What are you doing?

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:23.747
Chet!

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:24.581
Hey!

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.584
Come on, get back in the car.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:29.719
You're fine Chet, just breathe.

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:30.554
Hey.

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:34.491
Chet, you okay?

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.794
Chet.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:40.697
You okay?

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:44.868
Are you gonna talk to me?

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:46.603
Look, I'm sorry okay?

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.973
Hey we can try again tomorrow.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.078
- Where are we?

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:56.746
That's the stupidest
thing you could do.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:59.416
- Look, I'm--
- You're so stupid!

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:00.350
- I said I'm sorry.

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:02.085
- Sorry doesn't fix anything.

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:05.188
- Well I didn't know what this
whole agoraphobia was, okay?

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:07.223
I have the mentality
of the Marines still.

01:12:07.223 --> 01:12:08.792
We adapt and overcome.

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:11.995
- Well I didn't fucking enlist.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.797
- I really thought
I could help you.

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:14.631
- No!

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:17.967
You are not a
fucking psychiatrist!

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.036
You don't even know anything!

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:21.104
You don't know!

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:22.305
That was dangerous!

01:12:22.305 --> 01:12:24.674
What were you thinking, huh?

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:25.975
You're so lucky you're a girl

01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:27.911
or I'd beat the shit outta you.

01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:30.580
I don't care if you've
been to Iraq or whatever.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.915
I don't care about that.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:34.350
- I just wanna help you, Chet.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.885
- Well you're not my girlfriend

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.954
so I don't need you to fix me.

01:12:37.954 --> 01:12:39.589
- You think I wanna be with you?

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:41.190
Be your girlfriend?

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:44.594
Is that what you think?
- I don't know!

01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:46.430
What do you want, huh?

01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:49.165
A boyfriend?

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:49.999
A fuck buddy?

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:51.367
- Ooh, wow!

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.036
Wow wow wow wow wow!

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:56.039
I try to fuckin' help
you, you asshole.

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:59.609
I don't need a fuck buddy,
I have a fucking man.

01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:01.110
Wow.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.746
You know what?

01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:05.649
Why would I be with a little
fucking pussy like you

01:13:05.649 --> 01:13:07.050
that's afraid of people?

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.486
Ooh people and malls and air.

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:12.822
Un-fucking believable.

01:13:12.822 --> 01:13:15.391
Oh yeah, you wanna
know somethin'?

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.593
Enjoy the atmosphere.

01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:18.227
'Cause you know what
the weather bimbo said?

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.497
Today's air index
quality's purple.

01:13:20.497 --> 01:13:21.965
Very unhealthy.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.667
So you know what, hope
you survive the walk home.

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:26.670
(soft guitar music)

01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:30.874
(SUV engine revving)

01:13:30.874 --> 01:13:32.041
Move, move!
- Hey, hey!

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:35.411
- I don't care.
- Wait, that's my car!

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:36.646
Are you kidding me?

01:13:36.646 --> 01:13:37.481
Maggie!

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.216
Really?

01:13:40.216 --> 01:13:42.519
You're gonna do this.

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.153
(Chet breathing heavily)

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:45.421
Okay.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:49.292
* There is no one left
here to talk with *

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:56.232
* I'm talking to myself

01:13:56.232 --> 01:14:00.369
* Pick up and put
down the receiver *

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.511
* I'm talking to myself

01:14:07.511 --> 01:14:11.548
* Forever's not a word
you should trust *

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:15.084
* Sunshine national dust

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:18.522
* Forever's not over yet

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.670
(birds chirping)

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.710
(door knocking)

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.345
- [Chet] Maggie, can I come in?

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:43.179
Please?

01:14:44.648 --> 01:14:46.482
- Just gimme a second.

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:55.391
Yup, you can come in.

01:15:04.868 --> 01:15:08.572
- I'm really trying to let
go of my anger right now.

01:15:08.572 --> 01:15:11.708
You don't know how hard
that walk home was.

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:12.676
- You gonna kick me out?

01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:13.910
If you want me to--

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:16.212
- Would you just shut
up and let me talk?

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:17.046
Okay?

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.685
I know you meant well but you...

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.361
I'm sorry for what
I did and said.

01:15:33.797 --> 01:15:34.631
- Me too.

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:40.870
I'm starting to forget him.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:45.642
The last time I saw
him, he changed.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.582
I'm just forgetting him.

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:57.821
His smell.

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:03.492
He like had this smell and

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:04.327
this

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:08.998
taste when he used to kiss me.

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:11.334
My lips got so sore.

01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:14.103
I would get drunk
off his kisses.

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:25.815
- I think I love you.

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:33.556
I know you think it's 'cause
I'm lonely but I'm not.

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:39.228
All this time we've spent
together like a real couple.

01:16:41.164 --> 01:16:43.900
I've felt something
from you too.

01:16:45.869 --> 01:16:48.471
- I'm gonna visit him tomorrow.

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:54.210
- Oh.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.415
Well he's a lucky guy.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:15.999
- Ms Mosey, would you
come with me please?

01:17:15.999 --> 01:17:17.767
- I didn't have my visit yet.

01:17:17.767 --> 01:17:18.768
- Yes ma'am, I know that.

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:21.037
Would you please follow me.

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:27.711
Officer Madison's
goin' to escort you.

01:17:27.711 --> 01:17:29.212
- Escort me where?

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:33.016
Cut the shit, what happened?

01:17:33.016 --> 01:17:36.920
- [Forrester] Officer
Madison will take you in.

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.929
- Please, ma'am.

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:54.771
- How did it happen?

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:58.241
- [Madison] They said
it was from pneumonia.

01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:01.244
(soft, somber music)

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:18.627
- I just wanna see him.

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:20.029
- No.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:20.696
No Ms. Mosey, no.
- I wanna see my husband.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:21.630
Ms. Mosey, no.

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:22.732
- I wanna see my husband.

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:24.633
- Ms. Mosey, no!
- Get off of me!

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.102
- Call for assistance.

01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:27.036
Ms. Mosey, no!

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.204
- [Maggie] Get off of me!

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.638
Rick, Rick, Rick!

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:32.675
- [Forrester] No, no, please!

01:18:32.675 --> 01:18:34.744
- Get the fuck off of me!

01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:39.916
- I got this.

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:50.526
(engine revving)

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:53.529
(soft guitar music)

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:07.310
(guitar strumming)

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:19.588
- How'd it go?

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:47.083
Hey,

01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:48.918
you okay?

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:57.360
- Everything's gonna be okay.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:01.097
(Rick coughing)

01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:03.266
I need a doctor, you fuck!

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:04.968
Maggie.

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:29.993
- Maggie.

01:20:31.794 --> 01:20:32.862
Are you okay?

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:43.306
Hey, whoa.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:49.512
Hey, what are you doin'?

01:20:50.914 --> 01:20:54.217
Hey can you tell me
what's goin' on right now?

01:20:59.455 --> 01:21:00.523
Are you okay?

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:06.462
(soft piano music)

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:18.141
(Chet mumbling)

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:22.578
Will you please tell me what's
goin' on with you right now?

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:26.149
* What are you doing here

01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:29.752
* My familiar, my familiar

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:35.458
* I thought we parted ways

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:39.628
* But you keep coming
back for more *

01:21:52.675 --> 01:21:56.279
* My familiar, my familiar

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.153
* My familiar

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.294
* You

01:22:11.294 --> 01:22:14.563
* You know what I said

01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:18.968
* You know that I said

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:22.071
* Get out of my head

01:22:24.607 --> 01:22:27.943
* Get out of my head

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:31.280
* Why don't you listen

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.619
* I'm

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:45.328
* Through with you

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:06.115
(Chet mumbling)

01:23:14.223 --> 01:23:17.126
(foreboding music)

01:23:51.894 --> 01:23:54.663
(engine revving)

01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:16.452
- [Radio Announcer]
How difficult is it

01:24:16.452 --> 01:24:18.654
to pick up that
phone and talk about

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:20.556
hey, I'm having a bad day.

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:23.759
- [Caller] Took me eight years.

01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:25.994
So, yeah, it took me eight years

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:28.831
to be able to
actually ask for help.

01:24:28.831 --> 01:24:32.000
My doses actually
ended up going down.

01:24:33.136 --> 01:24:35.104
There are times when
you're suffering

01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:36.639
with mental health issues

01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:39.742
and you don't wanna
deal with people.

01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:42.711
You don't wanna commit.

01:24:42.711 --> 01:24:45.614
(soft vocal music)

01:25:25.288 --> 01:25:28.457
* I saw you there in
your hiding place *

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:32.961
* Where you were
scared of being found *

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:36.965
* And the dogs that
chase you down *

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:40.303
(muffled radio chatter)

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:49.044
* And I heard you there
with your lying mouth *

01:25:49.044 --> 01:25:53.216
* Tryin' to hide your
flaws in cigarette smoke *

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:57.553
* But I tasted you

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:02.691
(singers humming)

01:26:13.202 --> 01:26:16.372
* Ooh survive with me

01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:23.379
* Ooh survive with me

01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:34.257
* And I walked with you
on that winter night *

01:26:34.257 --> 01:26:38.427
* I was the moon
the unblinking eye *

01:26:39.662 --> 01:26:42.765
* And you saw me too

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:47.035
(singers humming)

01:26:58.547 --> 01:27:01.650
* Ooh survive with me

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.290
* Ooh survive with me

01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:10.025
(laptop beeping)

01:27:13.462 --> 01:27:14.397
- Hey.

01:27:14.397 --> 01:27:15.197
- [Ann] Hi, how's it going?

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:16.965
How's Diego working out?

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:20.469
- Oh, he's better than
I thought he'd be.

01:27:20.469 --> 01:27:21.770
- [Ann] Sorry.

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:22.605
- No, no.

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:26.108
Yeah, let's just say he's cool.

01:27:26.108 --> 01:27:28.277
- Chet Chet, listen to me.

01:27:29.545 --> 01:27:30.746
I read something interesting

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:33.416
that Stephen King
said in an interview.

01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:36.519
I think it's a
really good analogy--

01:27:36.519 --> 01:27:39.788
* I will take your (mumbles)

01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:43.058
* I will take them all

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.762
- Yeah, I'm listening.

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:50.265
* I will take your (mumbles)

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:53.402
* I will take (mumbles)

01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:56.639
* I will take them all

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.377
(energetic Celtic music)

01:28:09.151 --> 01:28:11.887
(birds chirping)

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:18.226
(soft guitar music)

01:28:51.226 --> 01:28:53.696
* I miss the girl that I miss

01:28:53.696 --> 01:28:57.500
* That I should have kissed

01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:00.369
* Like in some sad movie

01:29:00.369 --> 01:29:02.838
* I miss the money I had

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:06.709
* And I'm feelin' bad

01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:10.312
* And well wouldn't you be

01:29:26.895 --> 01:29:29.932
* Boxes and chairs
on the stairs *

01:29:29.932 --> 01:29:33.702
* Don't go up there

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:36.138
* Or you'll be sorry

01:29:36.138 --> 01:29:38.541
* And all the snow on the moon

01:29:38.541 --> 01:29:42.377
* Will be melting soon

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.680
* Why should we worry

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.016
* Every little
thing that I say *

01:29:48.016 --> 01:29:51.954
* Comes out the wrong way

01:29:51.954 --> 01:29:55.458
* In the sculpture garden

01:29:57.092 --> 01:30:00.429
* Now I'm calling
you on the phone *

01:30:00.429 --> 01:30:03.832
* Pick up if you're home

01:30:04.767 --> 01:30:08.471
* I beg your pardon
