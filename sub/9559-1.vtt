WEBVTT

02:22.976 --> 02:26.647
Narrator: First of all, it was October,
a rare month for boys,

02:27.522 --> 02:32.027
full of cold winds, long nights,
dark promises.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.156
Days get short.
The shadows lengthen.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.369
The wind warms in such a way,

02:40.744 --> 02:43.330
you want to run forever
through the fields,

02:43.664 --> 02:45.457
because up ahead,

02:46.083 --> 02:49.461
ten thousand pumpkins lie
waiting to be cut.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.399
Narrator: It was the October
of my 12th year

03:10.899 --> 03:12.219
when the seller of lightning rods

03:12.275 --> 03:14.861
came along the road
toward green town, Illinois,

03:15.737 --> 03:18.198
sneaking glances over his shoulder.

03:18.365 --> 03:22.369
Somewhere not far back
was a terrible storm.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.206
Even now,
on those special Autumn days,

03:26.498 --> 03:28.333
when the air smells like smoke,

03:28.667 --> 03:31.503
and the twilights
are orange and ash gray,

03:31.962 --> 03:33.964
my mind goes back to green town,

03:34.381 --> 03:35.882
the place where I grew up.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.802
In my memory,
I'm back on main street again,

03:39.386 --> 03:42.013
among the neighbors
who gave me my first glimpses

03:42.639 --> 03:44.725
into the fearful needs of the human heart.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.312
The cigar store was owned by Mr. Tetley,

03:49.688 --> 03:51.440
a man obsessed with money.

03:51.606 --> 03:52.774
Morning, Mr. Crosetti.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.362
Narrator: Mr. Crosetti, our barber,
cut my hair a thousand times,

03:57.779 --> 04:01.116
always talking about faraway ladies
he would never know.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.119
I remember ed the barman,

04:04.494 --> 04:06.246
yesterday's football hero.

04:06.663 --> 04:10.792
Still haunted by 40-yard runs
down the dark fields of his dreams.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.422
Our teacher was miss foley.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.593
We couldn't believe it, but folks said
that once, before we were even born,

04:20.302 --> 04:22.763
she had been
the most beautiful woman in town.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.023
And of course,
I can still see Jim nightshade,

04:33.523 --> 04:38.361
my best friend,
my blood brother, my shadow.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.380
- Finished?
- Yes, miss foley.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.383
- Then you may leave.
- Thank you, miss foley.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.718
Quietly.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.679
And let this be a lesson to both of you,

05:05.055 --> 05:07.140
I will not have whispering.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.454
- Never.
- Of course I can. I'm older.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.165
You're not older.
We were born on the same night.

05:32.332 --> 05:36.336
Yeah, I was born one minute to midnight
and you were born one minute after.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.842
- You see?
- I won't always be younger than you.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.473
- Will: Hey, Mr. Crosetti.
- Hello, boys.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.101
Will: Hello, Mr. Tetley.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.361
Oh, now, don't be messin' up my work.
All right, come on, I'll race ya.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.864
Man: Hellfire storm's a-comin'.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.993
An electric storm to clean your streets
and wash away your troubles.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.996
- So buy one of these lightning rods...
- Both boys: Tie!

06:11.162 --> 06:13.540
Some folks need special protection.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.210
I can sniff out
which of your old homes is in danger.

06:17.377 --> 06:22.173
Some folks draw lightning to 'em
as a cat sucks in a baby's breath.

06:27.429 --> 06:31.474
Narrator: But I suppose that this
is really the story of my father,

06:31.641 --> 06:34.352
and that strange, leaf-whispery Autumn,

06:35.145 --> 06:38.315
when his heart
was suddenly too old and too tired,

06:38.732 --> 06:40.942
and too full of yearning and regrets,

06:42.235 --> 06:43.987
and he didn't know what to do about it.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.743
- Hello, son.
- You saw me.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.579
What can I find you
that'll keep you awake all night?

06:52.746 --> 06:57.167
Let's see, travelers to the north pole?
Wild west. Zane grey, huh?

06:57.334 --> 07:01.004
- I don't think so, dad.
- Well, I thought all boys liked adventure.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.717
- I don't know. Do all fathers?
- Jim: Mine sure does.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.970
He's in Africa right now.
The gold coast of Africa.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.515
But he's coming back real soon,
and he's bringing me a present.

07:15.393 --> 07:19.856
He's bringing me a parrot.
The letter said a green-and-yellow one.

07:20.023 --> 07:24.861
And a native spear, and a war drum,
and a necklace made of human teeth.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.905
Oh, yes, and a shrunken head.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.699
- Have you ever seen a shrunken head?
- Only yours.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.702
Shh, boys. Now, young Jim nightshade,
what can I find you?

07:32.869 --> 07:37.666
Something from the arabian nights, now,
full of magicians and monsters? No?

07:37.832 --> 07:41.086
Let's see. Drums of doom?
The saga of the thunder lizards?

07:41.252 --> 07:44.631
No thanks, Mr. Halloway.
Something about headhunters.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.508
They're my father's friends right now.

07:47.509 --> 07:51.721
Look, who are you fooling?
Your father doesn't ever write.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.640
That's better than
a father who's afraid...

07:53.848 --> 07:56.017
My father's not afraid of anything.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.563
He's just a bit old, that's all.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.525
- That doesn't mean he's afraid.
- Doesn't it?

08:04.526 --> 08:07.278
Anyway, my father's here.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.491
Yours isn't coming back, is he?
Not ever.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.787
One day. You'll see.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.791
Shh, listen. Can you hear?

08:21.084 --> 08:23.712
- What is it?
- Listen. Why don't you ever listen?

08:24.254 --> 08:26.631
- I am.
- Like music.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.262
I don't hear no music.
It must be that old wind again.

08:41.938 --> 08:46.735
- Oh, do you live hereabouts, boys?
- These are our houses.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.030
One of which, as I listen to it,

08:50.613 --> 08:53.074
has murmuring timbers.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.327
Can't you hear it? Who tells ya?

08:57.078 --> 08:59.122
Tom fury tells ya.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.169
- Your house is in need of protection.
- Which house?

09:09.299 --> 09:11.801
- This one.
- It's his house.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.971
- Now, your names, gentlemen?
- Will halloway.

09:15.138 --> 09:19.350
- Jim nightshade.
- Well, Mr. Nightshade, sir.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.396
You just go right in and tell your father

09:23.563 --> 09:27.901
that Mr. Tom fury of the lightning rods

09:28.068 --> 09:30.278
presents his compliments,

09:30.779 --> 09:34.491
and your house
is in very urgent need of protection.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.327
- All right, I'll tell my father that.
- Jim!

09:37.994 --> 09:40.371
You want to say something, will halloway?

09:41.331 --> 09:45.085
Will, what kept you so late?
Your supper's ready.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.878
Coming, mom.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.172
- Later.
- Yeah.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.762
Jim? Is that you, Jim?

09:56.513 --> 09:57.806
Yes, mom.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.102
Darling, can you get yourself
something to eat out of the icebox?

10:02.477 --> 10:05.897
There's a ham in there,
and some peanut butter.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.983
Mother's just all tired out, darling.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.987
Jim, what are you doing?
Cat got your tongue?

10:13.154 --> 10:17.909
- Oh, we're buying a lightning rod, mom.
- Don't make jokes, please.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.751
- Well, my father said yes.
- Well done.

10:26.918 --> 10:30.964
Now, which one will you have? This one's
got old Chinese hen tracks on her.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.383
- A rod invented to catch...
- I'll have this one,

10:33.550 --> 10:36.469
with the beetles on there,
like an Egyptian scarab.

10:37.470 --> 10:42.267
Good boy. Once the lightning rod
on the pyramids of Egypt.

10:42.433 --> 10:46.396
Trained for 3,000 years to pitch
the lightning back to the high heavens.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.148
And it's yours for...

10:49.732 --> 10:51.401
How much you got there, boy?

10:54.320 --> 10:57.115
- It's yours.
- Thank you.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.786
You're welcome, Mr. Nightshade, sir.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.976
"Eight, seven, zero,"

11:25.143 --> 11:27.187
which surely has to be lucky.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.441
Do you ever play the numbers,
Mr. Halloway?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.776
Me? No. Never take risks.

11:33.943 --> 11:38.156
Well, you should, sir. One day
I'm gonna win that $100,000 number.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.201
And it won't be ten-cent cigars
for us then, Mr. Halloway.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.411
It'll be the big,
imported Havana specials,

11:43.494 --> 11:46.331
rolled on the plump,
smooth thighs of Cuban ladies.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.082
Mr. Halloway.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.631
- You can't smell it, can you?
- Smell what?

11:54.797 --> 11:58.635
Powder. Lady's powder and perfume.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.846
The sweet smell of rustling petticoats.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.767
Smells to me like
we're going to have visitors.

12:06.392 --> 12:10.146
Elegant visitors. Beautiful ladies.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.033
You'll have to make do with
the ladies you've got here, Mr. Crosetti.

12:13.149 --> 12:16.653
We don't get any visitors in this town.
Not in October.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.322
Or any other time of the year,
come to that.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.451
Do you know what you need,
Mr. Halloway?

12:25.578 --> 12:28.331
A touch of crosetti's color restorer.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.918
Make you feel years younger.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.129
I wish it were that easy.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.220
Oh, doc, did you see what
Northwestern did last week?

12:42.971 --> 12:44.889
Northwestern, 20 seconds to go,

12:45.014 --> 12:47.350
they got the ball,
he fades back for a pass.

12:47.517 --> 12:50.103
Touchdown. Wins by two!

12:50.270 --> 12:52.855
- Ed, doc.
- Charlie.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.900
Do you have any idea
what Northwestern's gonna do this week?

12:56.067 --> 12:59.320
Now, you remember your heart.
Just one drink and one cigar.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.298
Oh, come on now. You know what
they're gonna do?

13:01.322 --> 13:02.800
They're gonna kill 'em.
That's what they're gonna do.

13:02.824 --> 13:07.495
Boy, I tell ya, I wish I was out there
to run, to throw, tackle...

13:07.662 --> 13:10.790
Touchdowns. There's nothing like it,
to smell that grass, to run...

13:10.957 --> 13:12.208
Halloway: Ed.

13:14.752 --> 13:18.631
- Boy, ain't you somethin'.
- Always was, always was.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.093
- To your health, doc.
- Wait a minute. To Northwestern.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.594
Northwestern.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.972
Will: Jim!

13:36.566 --> 13:37.692
Jim.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.031
Jim, why don't you ever answer?

13:43.531 --> 13:46.284
I've got half a mind
to throw this darn thing away.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.911
- And get yourself burned?
- Yeah.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.668
Hey, look. A carnival.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.005
Saturday 24th. Why, that's tomorrow.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.867
Pretty big wind blowin' today,
huh, will boy?

15:11.619 --> 15:14.997
One of the stone lions
blew off the library steps.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.377
Prowlin' around town now.

15:20.503 --> 15:24.257
Lookin' for some juicy, tender
young Christian to eat, I don't wonder.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.807
You got something there, dad?

15:34.767 --> 15:35.935
Huh?

15:36.352 --> 15:37.562
No.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.533
You seem sad tonight, huh?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.618
Oh, it's will.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.955
He makes me feel so darn old.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.293
A man should be able to
play baseball with his son.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.837
Baseball is not necessary.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.922
Not with a heart like yours.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.134
He'll forgive you that, hm?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.469
Halloway: Hm.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.721
Maybe so.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.392
You know...

16:17.977 --> 16:19.353
I feel restless.

16:22.565 --> 16:23.858
Must be a storm comin'.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.164
Will: Dad?

18:20.474 --> 18:21.642
Will!

18:24.437 --> 18:27.648
Will, the carnival's come.
The carnival's come!

18:35.197 --> 18:38.034
- In the middle of the night?
- Hell, yes. Come on!

20:44.368 --> 20:45.911
- But how could...
- Come on!

21:10.561 --> 21:12.104
Will: Jim, don't.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.028
Halloway: Well, what is it, son?

23:25.154 --> 23:26.280
Can't sleep?

23:28.908 --> 23:30.618
Oh, well.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.286
Me neither.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.164
I thought I heard a train.

23:36.707 --> 23:39.752
Couldn't be, though.
Not this time of night.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.130
No, it couldn't have been.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.050
Couldn't be a carnival, could it?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.302
Not in October.

23:49.887 --> 23:54.016
I mean, you never saw no scraps of paper,
did you? Not about any carnival comin'.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.233
Three o'clock.

24:05.694 --> 24:09.323
They call it "the soul's midnight."

24:11.158 --> 24:14.995
- Do they? Why?
- I don't know.

24:16.038 --> 24:18.999
I guess it's a time
when a lot of people die.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.086
Uh, old people.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.297
I only meant old people.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.093
Old people?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.350
Will, uh...

24:38.852 --> 24:40.980
We should have a talk sometime.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.315
Just you and I.

24:44.566 --> 24:48.278
- What about?
- Oh, about when you were small.

24:50.406 --> 24:55.661
That, um... picnic that we took
down by indigo river.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.205
Look, son, I know you got
a fright then and...

24:58.330 --> 24:59.790
I better get back to bed now.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.753
Mom wouldn't like us up this late,
talking.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.881
She'd say we got to think of tomorrow.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.175
Yeah, yeah.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.429
Guess you're right, son.

25:30.404 --> 25:33.165
Woman: I want you to remember,
you boys have to stay with your father.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.492
Man: Now, Billie, don't start
picking on them already.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.419
Will: It's nothing but
a plain, ordinary old carnival.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.546
Jim: No, it can't be.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.631
It can't be ordinary.

25:50.424 --> 25:53.093
We just couldn't see it
last night in the dark.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.725
- It's ed.
- Hey, ed.

26:20.496 --> 26:24.625
Your prize, sir. A free pass
to our fabulous mirror maze.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.504
Thank you. Come on.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.775
Ed's voice: Boy, [tell ya, I wish
I was out there

26:50.109 --> 26:52.361
to run, to throw, tackle...

26:52.528 --> 26:54.530
Touchdowns. There's nothing like it,

26:54.613 --> 26:57.533
to smell that grass,
to run on the field...

27:06.542 --> 27:08.377
- Jim: Want to go in?
- Will: No.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.922
No?

27:12.089 --> 27:15.801
Those mirrors... they're like last night.

27:16.426 --> 27:20.764
Jim: Miss foley. Are you all right,
miss foley? Here we are. Are you okay?

27:21.932 --> 27:23.559
Jim, will.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.269
My two whisperers.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.815
I'm all right now.
Yes, of course I am. Silly.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.109
I must be tired out, I guess.

27:33.569 --> 27:38.407
Why, it's so bright in there.
So beautiful, so strange.

27:38.574 --> 27:42.119
It must have dazed me.
I don't quite remember.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.083
I must get home.
My little nephew's arriving.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.504
Is she ”I?

27:52.880 --> 27:57.426
I don't know. Must be a shock, though,
staring in all those mirrors.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.928
Especially if you have a face like that.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.725
Woman:
I can see your place of work, my good sir,

28:05.309 --> 28:08.896
and a red, white and blue pole turning.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.485
It's a miracle.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.032
Your eyes see everything.

28:23.118 --> 28:26.830
Woman: Only, I think there is something
missing from your life.

28:28.332 --> 28:31.084
Something that could make you so happy.

28:32.169 --> 28:33.545
Ladies.

28:35.297 --> 28:39.968
You have lived here a long time
without the scent of ladies' skin.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.847
They're waiting for you, my good sir.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.017
Call them.

28:51.188 --> 28:55.484
- Number two.
- Two! Number two, that's me. That's me!

28:55.651 --> 28:57.819
That's my number. I won it. I won!

28:57.986 --> 29:00.322
- So it is, sir. So it is.
- I won it! I won at last!

29:00.489 --> 29:03.325
- No need to agitate yourself.
- You don't know how long...

29:03.492 --> 29:08.330
One thousand. Now, here's one,
two, three, four, five,

29:08.497 --> 29:11.458
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

29:11.917 --> 29:15.087
One thousand dollars.
And may I offer you a cigar, sir?

29:15.337 --> 29:18.840
- Oh, thank you.
- A genuine Havana special.

29:19.007 --> 29:23.053
Rolled for you on the smooth,
plump thighs of Cuban beauties.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.138
And a free pass

29:25.347 --> 29:27.450
to our magnificent Ferris wheel,
compliments of the management.

29:27.474 --> 29:31.186
Oh, thank you. Oh, number two.
Who would have believed it?

29:32.646 --> 29:34.982
Oh, this is my lucky day.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.199
This is my lucky day.

29:45.367 --> 29:48.620
Uh, may I, uh, join you?

29:48.787 --> 29:49.871
Oh.

29:50.038 --> 29:54.209
Oh, this is my lucky day. I just won
a thousand dollars and I have it here.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.919
And now I get to sit next to,

29:56.044 --> 29:59.589
if I may say so,
a very beautiful... woman.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.008
It's a...

30:01.174 --> 30:04.886
It's a lucky day. Number two.
I won it on number two. Did you know that?

30:05.053 --> 30:09.391
Man: Step up, step up,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:09.558 --> 30:14.438
- See the exotic dancers from the erotic...
- Come on, Jim.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.774
You don't want to see this.
Come on!

30:17.941 --> 30:20.569
You've never seen before.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.864
These are dancers that will
thrill you, chill you...

30:29.870 --> 30:31.621
Jim, come on.

31:39.606 --> 31:43.610
Sorry, boys. Too young.
Come back in ten years.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.738
- I just saw...
- Shut up.

31:59.084 --> 32:02.462
Man: Lucky, lucky, lucky...

32:24.609 --> 32:25.902
Jim: Ooh.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.821
Look at this one.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.328
Wow!

32:40.167 --> 32:41.751
This one's my favorite.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.562
Put them down, Mr. Cooger.
Bring them back to earth again.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.152
The sign says "out of order," boys.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.937
Or don't they teach you reading
at this town's academy?

33:14.534 --> 33:16.036
Introductions all around?

33:17.662 --> 33:19.206
My name is Mr. Dark.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.334
I advise you to respect it.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.924
Of dark's pande-minium carnival?

33:29.549 --> 33:30.800
Isn't he the brave one?

33:54.866 --> 33:58.411
Show's over, boys.
All that's fit for you to see.

34:00.622 --> 34:05.961
Why don't you come back later,
for free rides on these exotic animals?

34:06.878 --> 34:09.798
See all the fun of the fairground.
What do you say?

34:10.632 --> 34:13.343
Go on. Go on, take them.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.403
I bet you somethin' goes on after sundown.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.488
We gotta stay and see.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.700
We can't stay after it closes.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.660
They'll Chuck us out.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.080
Not if they can't find us,
they won't. Come on.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.181
Jim: Come on.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.535
Mr. Dark: Mr. Cooger, are you ready?

35:35.258 --> 35:37.802
My gosh. Look.

35:39.054 --> 35:42.307
- It's going the wrong way.
- Backwards.

36:12.962 --> 36:15.006
Look at Mr. Cooger.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.224
It's late. Time to go back to your work.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.728
Mr. Cooger.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.095
Jim: Come on!

38:00.612 --> 38:03.490
- Look, it's miss foley's house.
- Will.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.201
Look, look. There.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.245
Who's that kid she's got in there
with her?

38:10.205 --> 38:11.664
Don't you know, will?

38:14.125 --> 38:17.170
- What are you playin' at?
- I want to warn miss foley.

38:18.213 --> 38:21.508
Don't you lie to me, Jim.
That's not what you want to do.

38:21.841 --> 38:25.220
You want to meet that... that... thing.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.638
No!

38:26.805 --> 38:28.890
No, oh, my gosh. Come on.

38:29.057 --> 38:32.727
Land sakes, who is it?
My two little whisperers.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.729
We wanted to see...

38:35.647 --> 38:37.273
If you were quite all right, miss foley.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.484
Yeah, we were kinda worried.

38:40.610 --> 38:44.781
That's very considerate of you boys.
I was just a little faint, I guess.

38:44.948 --> 38:48.034
Why don't you step inside?
Come in, will, come in.

38:48.618 --> 38:52.413
My nephew robertjust arrived,
and I baked a whole batch of cookies.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.708
Come in. Robert?

39:03.633 --> 39:06.010
I'd like you to meet
my young nephew, Robert.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.563
- Miss foley...
- Swell.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.023
Hi. Glad to meet you.

39:20.817 --> 39:23.611
Miss foley, we came to warn you.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.113
- Warn?
- Yes.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.449
He... he won't be in school Monday.
He's sick.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.118
- Miss foley: Oh?
- Yeah.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.452
See ya!

39:35.290 --> 39:37.083
What you up to, Jim?

39:37.876 --> 39:41.713
You touched his hand. His horrible,
devil's hand, and you touched it.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.257
Oh, shh.

40:20.168 --> 40:23.546
Will halloway,
you wicked, wicked hooligan.

40:23.713 --> 40:26.174
- But I didn't...
- Little liar. You stay right there.

40:26.341 --> 40:30.637
I'm coming down. Come back here.
Come back here this minute.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.805
I'm going to call your mother!

40:50.865 --> 40:54.035
- Dad.
- What's the trouble, boy?

41:14.263 --> 41:15.264
Mom?

41:18.184 --> 41:19.394
Jim.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.271
Oh, honey, supper's over. It's late.

41:22.438 --> 41:25.024
Well, we've already had our supper.

41:25.525 --> 41:29.237
But, I'll fix you something real nice.
Okay?

41:29.404 --> 41:33.157
- You hungry?
- No. It's all right, I guess.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.497
Jim?

41:42.000 --> 41:45.461
Well, just now, you know,
you seemed kinda glad to see me.

41:46.087 --> 41:50.425
- Well, at least you weren't the, uh...
- Mm, I wasn't the devil? Was that it?

41:51.134 --> 41:52.427
I guess.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.180
Will...

41:57.890 --> 42:00.184
About that picnic
down by the indigo river...

42:00.351 --> 42:02.729
- It's getting late...
- Now, now, you sit, son.

42:03.938 --> 42:08.818
- Sit until this is finished and done with.
- What?

42:09.152 --> 42:11.487
The talk we were tryin' to have
last night.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.490
It's one we should've had a long time ago,

42:15.283 --> 42:19.871
about that strong old current that swept
you way out in the middle of the river.

42:21.956 --> 42:24.500
And I stood there and watched...

42:25.835 --> 42:27.920
Tied to the riverbank and helpless.

42:29.464 --> 42:34.343
'Cause I had a dad who didn't think
it was right to teach boys to swim.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.264
Well...

42:39.307 --> 42:43.686
There was a man standin',
drinkin' liquor out of a stone bottle

42:43.853 --> 42:46.773
on the other side of the river,
and he dove in after you.

42:48.232 --> 42:52.445
Dove in without even taking his boots off,
and pulled you out of danger.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.325
I guess you must've been
all of four years old at the time.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.454
I knew someone caught hold of me.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.250
Someone who wasn't me.

43:10.505 --> 43:13.841
No one else knew who it was, but I did.

43:15.176 --> 43:19.222
It was Harry nightshade, son.
Your friend Jim's dad.

43:19.889 --> 43:23.351
A couple of years
before he lit off across the seas

43:23.518 --> 43:25.853
and was never seen in this town again.

43:26.854 --> 43:30.691
Mr. Nightshade did your father's work.

43:33.903 --> 43:35.947
I can't forgive myself for that...

43:37.657 --> 43:38.908
Or him either, I guess.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.287
But I'll tell you somethin', son.

43:46.374 --> 43:49.710
When you see the end of things
comin' close and starin' at you,

43:50.795 --> 43:54.507
it's not what you've done that you regret,
it's what you didn't do.

43:55.383 --> 43:56.843
And most of all...

43:57.760 --> 44:03.057
That afternoon at the river,
when there was nothin' I could do, will.

44:08.229 --> 44:12.066
Blame my father, if you like.
Blame me.

44:13.568 --> 44:16.237
We gotta stop blaming sometime.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.704
I wish you could be happy.

44:33.129 --> 44:38.009
Well... just tell me I'll live forever.
Then I'll be happy.

44:40.052 --> 44:43.556
Dad, don't talk death.
Someone'll hear you and...

44:45.933 --> 44:47.310
Dad...

44:53.232 --> 44:55.067
Guess I kept you up kinda late.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.529
Up you go.

45:05.578 --> 45:09.707
- Do you want to come up this way?
- Hm? Uh, I don't think so.

45:12.293 --> 45:16.505
- Because you're welcome.
- Uh, no. I want to finish my cigar.

45:19.967 --> 45:23.387
- I don't want to ditch you.
- I gotta lock up, will.

45:38.110 --> 45:41.405
Why do boys always
keep their windows open?

45:44.533 --> 45:46.118
Jim: Warm blood.

45:46.827 --> 45:48.037
Warm blood?

45:50.122 --> 45:52.250
That was your father's problem.

45:53.376 --> 45:54.919
What are you doing still awake?

45:56.712 --> 45:58.214
Do I look like him?

45:59.006 --> 46:01.384
I mean, do I look like my father?

46:05.179 --> 46:06.639
Too like.

46:08.557 --> 46:11.644
The day you leave home,
my Harry will be dead forever.

46:15.356 --> 46:17.692
- Go to sleep now, sweet dreams.
- Good night, mom.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.277
Good night, darling.

46:35.042 --> 46:37.753
Yes, please.

46:45.177 --> 46:46.595
Please.

46:48.723 --> 46:50.057
Please.

47:27.386 --> 47:28.804
Help me!

47:33.934 --> 47:35.686
Please, help me!

47:37.855 --> 47:39.231
Please, help me!

48:00.961 --> 48:02.213
Will: Jim?

48:02.380 --> 48:03.964
You're ditching me.

48:04.382 --> 48:06.384
Jim!

48:16.394 --> 48:18.854
- Where are you goin'?
- Back to the merry-go-round.

48:19.021 --> 48:23.192
Oh, no, you ain't.
He'll be there, that Mr. Cooger.

48:23.818 --> 48:27.988
Making himself so big and tall
and strong... he'll kill us.

48:29.156 --> 48:32.451
Let go. Let go, or so help me...
I'll remember this when I'm...

48:32.618 --> 48:35.287
- When what?
- When I'm older, darn it. Older.

48:35.454 --> 48:36.956
When you're older?

48:37.623 --> 48:39.542
- I didn't mean...
- Oh, yes you did!

48:39.708 --> 48:42.920
If that darn merry-go-round
could make Mr. Cooger younger...

48:44.296 --> 48:48.801
Why, you think you'd be older if you got
on it and went the other way around.

48:49.218 --> 48:52.430
Is that what you figured out
in your little mind, Jim nightshade?

48:53.013 --> 48:55.474
You'd be two feet taller,
looking down at me...

48:58.561 --> 49:00.563
And you'd ditch me.

49:02.857 --> 49:03.897
Wait!

49:13.159 --> 49:16.370
Mr. Cooger: That's the trouble,
those two boys. Should we...

49:16.537 --> 49:19.165
Mr. Dark: Just make certain
they don't interfere in our work.

49:21.083 --> 49:25.212
Oh, doom, damnation,
death and destruction.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.299
Who tells you?
Tom fury tells you.

49:28.466 --> 49:32.553
Tell me when, you old fool.
When is the lightning due?

49:32.720 --> 49:34.805
I am Tom fury.

49:34.972 --> 49:38.058
Did I take the name?
No, sir. The name took me...

49:38.225 --> 49:42.354
I must know.
Lightning reveals our dark corners.

49:42.521 --> 49:45.191
Rain washes away our dust.
Tell me when.

49:46.317 --> 49:50.529
What color is lightning?
Where does the thunder go when it dies?

49:50.696 --> 49:53.491
- Will: Mr. Crosetti.
- Jim: And Mr. Tetley!

49:53.657 --> 49:59.038
What country does the rain come from?
Who knows? Tom fury knows.

49:59.747 --> 50:03.125
If I show her to you, your bride...

50:04.001 --> 50:05.920
You will tell me when the storm is coming.

50:41.956 --> 50:43.499
Most beautiful.

50:54.218 --> 50:59.890
More beautiful than pocahontas,
than Helen of Troy...

51:00.057 --> 51:02.097
Mr. Dark: You will tell me
when the storm is coming.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.187
When comes the storm?

51:07.565 --> 51:10.734
Oh, Tom fury says the lightning
shall jump the world,

51:10.901 --> 51:13.320
and make men hop and skip
like scalded cats.

51:13.487 --> 51:18.576
You fool. Lightning shall
make you hop and make you tell!

51:19.076 --> 51:20.953
Tom fury: Ohh...

51:21.120 --> 51:23.622
Storm due... due...

51:23.789 --> 51:26.875
- Tom fury has a secret!
- When?

51:27.668 --> 51:30.337
Tom fury:
So has the lightning and the thunder.

51:31.755 --> 51:33.966
Will: Stop. Stop it!

52:01.118 --> 52:02.745
Mr. Dark: Those boys...

52:03.621 --> 52:05.164
They've seen too much.

52:06.248 --> 52:07.541
Hunt them down...

52:09.418 --> 52:11.337
And bring them back to me.

53:04.932 --> 53:09.269
It's that Jim nightshade. And take
your hat off. He's a bad influence.

53:09.436 --> 53:11.689
- But, mom...
- Don't you "but, mom" me.

53:12.064 --> 53:14.024
How dare you sneak out this late?

53:14.733 --> 53:17.986
I want no excuses.
Now march, right upstairs.

53:22.116 --> 53:23.367
Yes, go up, son.

53:46.515 --> 53:49.893
You know, I never liked my father either,
a lot of the time.

53:52.312 --> 53:55.441
- Was grandpa a good man?
- Everyone thought so.

53:56.984 --> 54:00.237
- And he knew about evil?
- He talked a lot about it.

54:01.488 --> 54:02.614
Really knew?

54:03.157 --> 54:07.369
We had devils for breakfast,
lunch, and supper in our house.

54:10.330 --> 54:11.832
I believe in devils.

54:14.001 --> 54:17.629
But if you're a good person,
they can't hurt you, can they?

54:21.133 --> 54:23.969
Am I... a good person?

54:25.929 --> 54:29.933
I wouldn't count on your mother's answer
right now, but I think you are.

54:32.728 --> 54:33.729
Yeah.

54:33.896 --> 54:35.314
Drink your milk, then.

54:36.190 --> 54:37.566
Maybe we'll talk tomorrow.

54:39.193 --> 54:40.527
Dad?

54:42.279 --> 54:43.405
Hm?

54:43.530 --> 54:46.533
Be careful, dad.
Something's going on.

54:47.743 --> 54:49.369
Something?

54:49.536 --> 54:52.456
Just be careful, okay?

54:55.334 --> 54:56.335
Okay.

55:54.935 --> 55:57.312
Quick, will, quick!

56:13.453 --> 56:14.621
Listen to that.

57:04.671 --> 57:06.465
Quick, Jim, this way.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.929
Look out!

59:16.553 --> 59:20.557
So, when the mom

59:20.724 --> 59:26.313
of endless light is waking

59:26.480 --> 59:31.359
and shades of evil

59:31.526 --> 59:36.448
from its splendors flee

59:36.615 --> 59:38.283
amen

59:43.080 --> 59:44.664
Hey, a parade!

59:46.917 --> 59:48.126
No.

59:49.002 --> 59:51.129
A search... for us.

59:51.505 --> 59:55.050
We can't go home.
They'd follow us and kill our folks.

1:00:16.988 --> 1:00:19.991
- Hello?
- Dad, they're after us.

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:24.412
- Look, son, you come home. And...
- I can't.

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:27.499
Will?

1:00:43.306 --> 1:00:47.269
- Will: They're coffins.
- Jim: Yeah, kid size.

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:13.211
Man: Hi there!

1:02:01.301 --> 1:02:02.469
Ma?

1:02:05.639 --> 1:02:07.182
Woman: I love the parade.

1:02:16.566 --> 1:02:18.151
- Hey, Charlie.
- Huh? Doc.

1:02:18.318 --> 1:02:20.278
Charlie, look here. The bar is empty.

1:02:20.403 --> 1:02:22.697
First time in 20 years,
there's nobody there.

1:02:22.864 --> 1:02:26.159
- Ed must've just taken off.
- He wouldn't do that. That's not like ed.

1:03:05.448 --> 1:03:06.866
Doc: Now, that's odd.

1:03:07.534 --> 1:03:11.579
It sure is.
Hey, doc, have you seen will and ji...

1:03:16.001 --> 1:03:20.755
Excuse me, gentlemen. I am a stranger
in this town. Perhaps you could help me.

1:03:20.922 --> 1:03:24.843
My name is dark.
I'm looking for two young boys.

1:03:26.886 --> 1:03:30.223
- Town's full of them.
- Yes. No doubt, sir. No doubt.

1:03:30.807 --> 1:03:33.727
But these boys in particular,
they're two of a kind.

1:03:33.893 --> 1:03:37.772
Much of a height. One towheaded,
the other black as pitch.

1:03:37.939 --> 1:03:39.941
You could take them for blood brothers.

1:03:41.067 --> 1:03:44.946
- What have they done?
- Done, sir? Why, nothing wrong, surely.

1:03:45.780 --> 1:03:48.658
No, they're two lucky lads
who've won prizes at the carnival.

1:03:49.492 --> 1:03:53.204
I merely wish to give them the valuable
rewards that they so richly deserve.

1:03:55.915 --> 1:03:57.083
Can you help me?

1:03:58.585 --> 1:04:00.962
Excuse me. See you, doc.

1:04:02.255 --> 1:04:03.423
Charlie?

1:04:13.850 --> 1:04:15.810
Dad.

1:04:18.229 --> 1:04:21.024
- Lose something, sir?
- Uh...

1:04:21.775 --> 1:04:25.653
Uh, folks around here all seem to be
taking a holiday, hm?

1:04:25.904 --> 1:04:27.280
Must be the carnival.

1:04:27.530 --> 1:04:31.493
These boys I'm looking for,
perhaps you know them?

1:04:31.701 --> 1:04:32.702
Halloway: Hm...

1:04:32.911 --> 1:04:36.623
Won prizes, I think you said.
Lucky fellers.

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:39.334
- Have a cigar?
- No.

1:04:52.972 --> 1:04:54.557
Well, now, I wouldn't uh,

1:04:54.891 --> 1:04:57.560
want a couple of kids
to miss out on their good fortune.

1:04:59.270 --> 1:05:01.523
Let me see, that one.
Yes, I know him well.

1:05:01.689 --> 1:05:03.691
- His name's, uh...
- Yes?

1:05:04.150 --> 1:05:05.568
Uh, Milton blumquist.

1:05:07.529 --> 1:05:11.199
And that... oh... that's Avery Johnson.

1:05:11.616 --> 1:05:13.743
Yeah. Fine boys, fine.

1:05:13.910 --> 1:05:16.162
Both of 'em quite a credit
to this little town,

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:17.789
if you want to know the truth.

1:05:18.373 --> 1:05:19.999
I do want to know the truth, sir.

1:05:20.834 --> 1:05:22.919
And the truth is that you are lying.

1:05:23.837 --> 1:05:25.672
You see, I already have their names.

1:05:26.381 --> 1:05:29.342
I got them from a blind girl,
used to be a teacher hereabouts.

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:32.011
A poor creature by the name of foley.

1:05:33.304 --> 1:05:36.975
Will is the fair-haired,
and Jim, the dark.

1:05:38.685 --> 1:05:43.148
Now tell me, old man, what's your name?

1:05:43.815 --> 1:05:45.400
Halloway, sir.

1:05:45.859 --> 1:05:49.779
- Charles William halloway.
- Oh, yes. The town's librarian.

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:52.198
Halloway: I have the honor, sir.

1:05:52.449 --> 1:05:54.492
Mr. Dark:
And have had for many years, I believe.

1:05:55.493 --> 1:05:59.247
All that time spent living
only through other men's lives.

1:06:00.748 --> 1:06:03.042
Dreaming only other men's dreams.

1:06:03.918 --> 1:06:07.088
- What a waste.
- Sometimes a man can learn more

1:06:07.255 --> 1:06:09.757
from other men's dreams
than he can from his own.

1:06:11.676 --> 1:06:15.555
Come visit me, sir, if you would
wish to improve your education.

1:06:15.722 --> 1:06:19.142
I will. And I may improve yours.

1:07:17.450 --> 1:07:19.285
Boys, what the hell's goin' on?

1:07:46.813 --> 1:07:48.273
Come to the library tonight.

1:08:13.047 --> 1:08:18.094
Jim: That's why they had the parade,
so they could find us and kill us.

1:08:18.428 --> 1:08:24.058
Will: And so, we had to hide,
because, well... who'd believe us?

1:08:24.559 --> 1:08:28.146
- Halloway: I believe you.
- Jim: You do? But we're not grownups.

1:08:28.605 --> 1:08:31.274
That's why I believe you.
Now, listen to this.

1:08:31.941 --> 1:08:36.446
Diary of my father, Charles Herbert
halloway, minister of this town:

1:08:37.822 --> 1:08:40.617
"October, 1891.

1:08:41.492 --> 1:08:46.998
"We have had no good fortune since
there arrived here the Autumn carnival.

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:52.920
"It seems strange to speak of such things
in these enlightened days.

1:08:53.463 --> 1:08:56.174
"A poor, lame servant girl
went to the fortuneteller

1:08:56.257 --> 1:08:58.676
"to inquire how she might run.

1:08:58.843 --> 1:09:03.306
"Her leg mended...
And then she ran mad.

1:09:07.018 --> 1:09:11.606
"It seems they destroy people
by granting their dearest wishes,

1:09:12.023 --> 1:09:16.694
"as has been the way of the devil
since god created the world.

1:09:18.571 --> 1:09:23.618
"Old folks of this town say they remember
such a carnival of evil

1:09:24.619 --> 1:09:28.247
"visiting many autumns past,
in the days of their youth.

1:09:37.965 --> 1:09:43.054
"The traveling people swore
they would return, some other Autumn.

1:09:44.389 --> 1:09:48.851
"Each time their visit ended
with a most unusual storm."

1:09:53.189 --> 1:09:57.568
- It's Mr. Dark.
- Go on, son. Hide, quick.

1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:42.572
"By the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes."

1:10:43.156 --> 1:10:49.495
"Then rang the bells both loud and deep,
god is not dead, nor doth he sleep."

1:10:50.329 --> 1:10:56.377
"The wrong will fail, the right, prevail,
with peace on earth, goodwill to men."

1:10:56.544 --> 1:10:59.213
It's a thousand years to Christmas,
Mr. Halloway.

1:11:00.006 --> 1:11:05.344
You're wrong. It's here in this library
tonight, and can't be spoiled.

1:11:05.511 --> 1:11:08.890
Did will and Jim bring it with them
on the soles of their shoes?

1:11:10.016 --> 1:11:11.768
Then we shall have to scrape them.

1:11:14.187 --> 1:11:15.396
Will?

1:11:17.899 --> 1:11:19.108
Jim?

1:11:21.486 --> 1:11:23.654
Free rides on the merry-go-round.

1:11:26.741 --> 1:11:29.494
How would you like to be
king of the carnival, Jim?

1:11:30.912 --> 1:11:32.914
The ruler of the rides?

1:11:36.459 --> 1:11:38.461
How would you like to be grown up, Jim?

1:11:40.421 --> 1:11:42.381
How would that feel, huh?

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:46.010
Not to be looked down at.

1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:50.223
Not to be told to run away and play.

1:11:51.933 --> 1:11:53.142
To be trusted.

1:11:54.477 --> 1:11:55.728
To be feared.

1:11:56.854 --> 1:12:01.192
To know what grownups do behind
locked doors when children are asleep.

1:12:06.197 --> 1:12:07.573
Come out to me, Jim.

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:14.872
I'm the father you've been waiting for...

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:17.291
My son.

1:12:22.755 --> 1:12:24.257
I know who you are.

1:12:27.301 --> 1:12:29.011
You are the Autumn people.

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:33.307
Where do you come from?
The dust.

1:12:33.975 --> 1:12:36.143
Where do you go to? The grave.

1:12:36.310 --> 1:12:37.395
Yes.

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:39.605
We are the hungry ones.

1:12:40.773 --> 1:12:43.943
Your torments call us
like dogs in the night.

1:12:44.443 --> 1:12:47.613
And we do feed, and feed well.

1:12:47.780 --> 1:12:50.950
Halloway: You stuff yourselves
on other people's nightmares.

1:12:51.117 --> 1:12:54.662
And butter our plain bread
with delicious pain.

1:12:55.580 --> 1:12:59.208
So you do understand a little.

1:13:00.084 --> 1:13:02.712
You are known in this town.
My father knew you.

1:13:02.879 --> 1:13:06.591
Your father. The preacher?
That half-man?

1:13:06.757 --> 1:13:09.802
- He lived on goodness.
- Tasteless fare.

1:13:09.969 --> 1:13:12.555
Funerals, bad marriages,

1:13:12.722 --> 1:13:15.308
lost loves, lonely beds.

1:13:15.474 --> 1:13:17.602
That is our diet.

1:13:17.768 --> 1:13:20.813
We suck that misery and find it sweet.

1:13:20.980 --> 1:13:23.065
We search for more, always.

1:13:24.442 --> 1:13:28.321
We can smell young boys
ulcerating to be men a thousand miles off.

1:13:29.238 --> 1:13:32.742
And hear a middle-aged fool like you
groaning with midnight despairs

1:13:32.909 --> 1:13:34.702
from halfway around the world.

1:13:38.205 --> 1:13:40.875
Your books cannot hurt me, old man.

1:13:42.251 --> 1:13:44.128
Yes, old.

1:13:45.004 --> 1:13:46.881
Because your heart is old.

1:13:47.965 --> 1:13:49.300
Listen to it.

1:13:53.220 --> 1:13:58.476
You tell me where the boys are hiding,
and I can make you young again.

1:14:00.102 --> 1:14:02.605
I could turn your years back for you to...

1:14:03.773 --> 1:14:05.858
Let's say, 30?

1:14:08.069 --> 1:14:11.113
Now speak, or you've missed it.

1:14:12.281 --> 1:14:13.532
Going...

1:14:16.661 --> 1:14:18.120
It's gone.

1:14:19.622 --> 1:14:21.457
Thirty-one.

1:14:23.167 --> 1:14:26.087
Thirty-two, 32?

1:14:26.253 --> 1:14:29.882
Year of a man's prime,
loved by many women.

1:14:30.049 --> 1:14:33.886
You might still learn to swim.
Thirty-two, going...

1:14:34.387 --> 1:14:37.807
Gone. Thirty-three, 34.

1:14:38.724 --> 1:14:41.227
Thirty-five, 35?

1:14:41.394 --> 1:14:42.895
Oh, 35.

1:14:43.604 --> 1:14:46.857
Time to father a family, build a fortune.

1:14:47.024 --> 1:14:50.987
Thirty-five, a year when you could run
up the stairs without panting for breath.

1:14:51.612 --> 1:14:53.698
Thirty-five.

1:14:53.864 --> 1:14:55.866
Gone, 36...

1:14:56.909 --> 1:14:58.327
Thirty-seven.

1:14:58.911 --> 1:15:01.831
Where are they? Thirty-eight.

1:15:03.332 --> 1:15:07.628
Hear your heart, hear my count.

1:15:08.754 --> 1:15:10.297
Thirty-nine.

1:15:10.464 --> 1:15:13.467
Now, 39, a fine year.

1:15:13.634 --> 1:15:16.470
Still young, 39...

1:15:16.637 --> 1:15:18.305
Gone. Oh, oh!

1:15:18.472 --> 1:15:23.436
Forty, 40, and hear your old, old heart!

1:15:23.602 --> 1:15:25.646
Dad, no. Don't listen!

1:15:29.191 --> 1:15:33.279
And is that the voice
of green grass and sunshine?

1:15:34.405 --> 1:15:37.908
Sweet Eden's child,
the innocent young will?

1:15:41.454 --> 1:15:42.872
Forty-two.

1:15:44.373 --> 1:15:45.750
Forty-th ree.

1:15:46.917 --> 1:15:48.169
Forty-fou r.

1:15:48.461 --> 1:15:50.463
Forty-five, 46,

1:15:50.629 --> 1:15:54.884
forty-seven, 48, 49, 50, and 52.

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:57.053
Your loss!

1:16:04.435 --> 1:16:06.979
- You fool.
- Damn you.

1:16:07.146 --> 1:16:11.067
A taste of death?

1:16:11.442 --> 1:16:14.945
So you'll know it
when it comes again, soon.

1:16:30.544 --> 1:16:32.379
Jim? Will?

1:16:36.801 --> 1:16:38.385
It's time to go.

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.808
Jim nightshade.

1:16:44.683 --> 1:16:48.521
What a good...
What a proper name for a carnival.

1:16:49.730 --> 1:16:53.859
Dark and nightshade's
pandemonium carnival.

1:16:55.236 --> 1:16:56.904
That's your name, Jim.

1:16:58.197 --> 1:17:00.157
Mr. Nightshade.

1:17:03.077 --> 1:17:04.620
Will, then.

1:17:05.704 --> 1:17:06.872
Will?

1:17:07.873 --> 1:17:10.084
Your mother was at the carnival tonight.

1:17:10.376 --> 1:17:12.253
She rode the carousel.

1:17:14.421 --> 1:17:18.217
She went backwards and forwards...

1:17:19.135 --> 1:17:23.556
Until she was quite, quite mad.

1:17:27.143 --> 1:17:30.771
You should've heard
the one single sound she made.

1:17:38.737 --> 1:17:40.281
Come out now.

1:17:42.700 --> 1:17:44.034
Jim?

1:17:46.245 --> 1:17:47.830
Jim, you're the clever one.

1:17:49.582 --> 1:17:51.542
You tell me where your friend is hiding,

1:17:52.626 --> 1:17:56.213
and I can guarantee you
a very special reward.

1:18:08.392 --> 1:18:12.605
Now, where would you be filed, I wonder?

1:18:14.356 --> 1:18:16.025
Under a for adventure...

1:18:16.984 --> 1:18:18.986
Or b for boys?

1:18:20.362 --> 1:18:21.906
J for Jim...

1:18:22.781 --> 1:18:24.658
Or n for nightshade?

1:18:26.076 --> 1:18:27.870
H for halloway...

1:18:29.830 --> 1:18:31.582
Or h for hidden?

1:19:03.072 --> 1:19:06.158
Well, here's a couple of fine new books.

1:19:06.951 --> 1:19:09.203
I'll enjoy cutting this one's pages.

1:19:15.292 --> 1:19:16.335
Mom!

1:19:21.882 --> 1:19:23.634
Seems I made a little mistake.

1:19:24.677 --> 1:19:27.054
It must've been your mother,
Jim, at the carnival.

1:19:30.432 --> 1:19:31.809
Poor thing.

1:19:33.727 --> 1:19:35.104
What a tragedy.

1:19:35.854 --> 1:19:38.565
Still, you won't be needing her anymore.

1:19:39.358 --> 1:19:43.529
Look. You have a fine, new mother now.

1:19:54.164 --> 1:19:56.208
Time to quiet these two chatterers.

1:19:57.042 --> 1:19:59.211
Time to still these two whisperers.

1:20:01.547 --> 1:20:05.009
Lose their tongues
until I choose to find them again.

1:20:05.926 --> 1:20:08.929
Woman: Quiet, you two chatterers.

1:20:10.222 --> 1:20:13.642
Still, you two whisperers.

1:20:26.697 --> 1:20:30.200
And give him a brief taste of death,

1:20:30.367 --> 1:20:33.037
so that he may recognize it
when it comes again.

1:20:53.390 --> 1:20:56.935
Woman: Old man,
hear your heart beating.

1:21:00.230 --> 1:21:02.775
Slow, now.

1:21:03.567 --> 1:21:06.153
Slower...

1:21:30.469 --> 1:21:32.137
Woman: Slower...

1:21:33.597 --> 1:21:35.682
Slower...

1:21:36.558 --> 1:21:39.478
Slowest.

1:21:54.368 --> 1:21:57.746
What times we're going to have,
Jim, you and I.

1:21:58.747 --> 1:22:00.624
Dark and nightshade.

1:22:02.209 --> 1:22:04.169
Nightshade and dark.

1:22:05.504 --> 1:22:09.258
And will...
We'll ride him backwards, shall we?

1:22:10.300 --> 1:22:12.010
Turn him into a little baby,

1:22:12.928 --> 1:22:14.930
a plaything for our little friend here.

1:23:15.616 --> 1:23:17.826
Harry, is that you?

1:23:18.243 --> 1:23:19.244
Oh.

1:23:19.411 --> 1:23:23.248
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Halloway.
I... I was expecting somebody else.

1:23:23.415 --> 1:23:25.542
See, I have a message, I have a ticket...

1:23:25.709 --> 1:23:27.145
- Whatever the messages...
- What are you doing?

1:23:27.169 --> 1:23:28.271
They'll be lies.
Believe me and go home.

1:23:28.295 --> 1:23:29.481
No. I have to wait here for Harry...

1:23:29.505 --> 1:23:30.815
Go home, Mrs. Nightshade, for god's sake,

1:23:30.839 --> 1:23:31.715
- go home!
- No!

1:23:31.798 --> 1:23:33.926
The man coming for you
isn't your husband.

1:23:36.303 --> 1:23:39.264
But... they told me...

1:24:17.844 --> 1:24:20.097
Dad!

1:24:42.744 --> 1:24:44.997
Mr. Dark's voice:
Not dead yet, Mr. Halloway?

1:24:46.707 --> 1:24:49.668
Come looking in my mirrors
for another chance?

1:24:50.961 --> 1:24:52.379
Shall I help you find it?

1:24:53.338 --> 1:24:55.007
Would you know it if you saw it?

1:24:56.300 --> 1:24:59.386
Here the mirror of dreams, of beauty.

1:25:00.512 --> 1:25:04.766
Can crosetti tell you
of incredible loves he never lived?

1:25:05.517 --> 1:25:06.768
Over here.

1:25:07.269 --> 1:25:12.983
See the mirror of riches beyond wishing,
where Mr. Tetley's buried.

1:25:14.109 --> 1:25:15.193
Halloway!

1:25:15.694 --> 1:25:19.364
Look. Look here for the great and famous.

1:25:21.950 --> 1:25:26.538
Ed, the barman hero
of all the football years.

1:25:27.789 --> 1:25:30.375
All his cheering crowds gone.

1:25:35.547 --> 1:25:40.135
Here, the looking glass
of pride and ruined vanity,

1:25:40.302 --> 1:25:43.847
where wars of time are fought and lost.

1:25:45.182 --> 1:25:46.391
And now this.

1:25:48.935 --> 1:25:52.439
This is your glass of darkness,
Mr. Halloway.

1:25:53.315 --> 1:25:56.109
Its name, regret.

1:25:56.943 --> 1:25:59.988
Its sum, despair.

1:26:18.799 --> 1:26:22.678
Mr. Dark's voice:
Drink deep its funeral sights and sounds.

1:26:24.846 --> 1:26:28.558
Your failure as a father and as a man.

1:26:30.602 --> 1:26:33.313
Your son hates you.

1:26:35.148 --> 1:26:41.279
You've lost him. He's mine,
and young Jim nightshade, too.

1:26:43.365 --> 1:26:45.784
Drown, halloway.

1:26:47.035 --> 1:26:49.996
Drown in your regrets.

1:26:53.583 --> 1:26:56.002
Dad!

1:26:56.169 --> 1:26:58.213
Dad, please!

1:27:04.803 --> 1:27:06.847
I love you.

1:27:08.056 --> 1:27:10.559
I love you.

1:27:11.518 --> 1:27:13.979
I love you!

1:27:22.654 --> 1:27:25.282
Dad! Dad! Please!

1:27:33.373 --> 1:27:36.042
I love you!

1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:32.432
King of the carnival, my son.

1:28:33.809 --> 1:28:35.310
Will: Jim!

1:28:35.811 --> 1:28:38.563
My partner, forever.

1:28:39.189 --> 1:28:40.732
Will: Jim!

1:28:41.233 --> 1:28:43.777
Jim! Jim, no!

1:28:44.611 --> 1:28:46.321
Don't ditch me!

1:29:17.978 --> 1:29:19.521
Jim, please.

1:29:20.564 --> 1:29:24.025
- Don't die.
- Stop that, do you hear? Stop it.

1:29:25.610 --> 1:29:30.699
Tears, that's what they like!
My god, how they like tears!

1:29:32.033 --> 1:29:35.453
Look, that's no way to save young Jim.

1:29:40.959 --> 1:29:44.462
Jump around, eh?
Whoop and holler.

1:29:44.629 --> 1:29:47.966
Go on, look at me, eh?
Look at me.

1:29:48.133 --> 1:29:50.886
I'm the great whooping crane.

1:29:51.052 --> 1:29:53.013
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

1:29:56.182 --> 1:29:58.643
Come on, happiness makes 'em run.

1:30:06.484 --> 1:30:08.445
Dad, look.

1:30:12.824 --> 1:30:15.869
Hey, dad, he's alive! Jim!

1:30:26.004 --> 1:30:27.839
Halloway: Let's get outta here.

1:33:02.494 --> 1:33:04.954
And tie!

1:33:22.680 --> 1:33:27.018
Jim: For my father,
being old was all right now.

1:33:27.185 --> 1:33:31.439
He had freed himself from the shadows,
and liberated our town.

1:33:32.899 --> 1:33:35.318
So, I think he knew
on that bright morning,

1:33:36.152 --> 1:33:37.570
that he'd made a memory

1:33:38.363 --> 1:33:43.576
that would live as long as sons tell sons
about fathers they love.
