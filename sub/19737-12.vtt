Over 68 million Americans

00:02.890 --> 00:05.049
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:05.085 --> 00:06.985
If danger strikes,

00:07.020 --> 00:09.354
the FBI's International Response Team

00:09.389 --> 00:11.756
is called into action.

00:23.464 --> 00:26.399
Reach your hands to heaven.

00:26.434 --> 00:29.339
Palms to the sky.

00:29.386 --> 00:33.505
Let the spirit of the
Himalaya fill your soul.

00:33.541 --> 00:35.841
Bring your hands to your heart.

00:35.876 --> 00:38.243
And inhale

00:38.278 --> 00:40.611
the love of yourselves.

00:42.649 --> 00:47.652
And exhale to close your practice.

00:47.687 --> 00:49.254
Namaste.

00:49.289 --> 00:50.956
Namaste.

00:50.991 --> 00:54.591
Beautiful practice,
all of you. Beautiful.

00:54.626 --> 00:55.792
Hey.

00:55.828 --> 00:58.295
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:58.331 --> 01:01.465
- Bye.
- See you later.

01:40.437 --> 01:42.304
Call me a traditionalist,

01:42.339 --> 01:45.306
but the map that I have says 2-9-0-2-8.

01:45.341 --> 01:48.476
Okay, so, what? So
cartographers can't do math?

01:48.511 --> 01:50.744
8,840 meters

01:50.779 --> 01:54.215
is 29,029 feet.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.851
Guys, it's one foot
difference over almost 30,000.

01:57.887 --> 01:59.420
Why is it so important?

01:59.455 --> 02:00.854
- It's precision.
- Accuracy.

02:00.890 --> 02:02.422
Exactly. And the conventionally

02:02.457 --> 02:04.590
accepted height of
Mount Everest is tw...

02:04.626 --> 02:09.562
29,035 feet. AMEE used GPS to
measure bedrock back in '99,

02:09.597 --> 02:13.400
but if you wanna argue science,
I got Mencin on speed dial.

02:13.435 --> 02:15.235
Uh, what is happening?

02:23.411 --> 02:24.743
You're afraid to fly, remember?

02:24.778 --> 02:26.378
Please don't remind me.

02:27.721 --> 02:28.820
Morning, everyone.

02:28.830 --> 02:30.999
Yeah, Jack, I think
that Monty's lost again.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.352
Not this time he's not.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.921
Nepal is still recovering
from last year's earthquake.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.856
I asked him to join to
help us with communications.

02:38.891 --> 02:40.525
First international mission?

02:40.560 --> 02:41.559
Yep.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.627
Fine. Rookie hazing it is.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.598
But that red shirt on
the away team, bad choice.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.200
Monty, you wanna get us started?

02:49.235 --> 02:51.135
Yeah. Uh, two days ago...

02:51.171 --> 02:53.537
Meegan Whitney of Haddonfield, Illinois,

02:53.572 --> 02:55.439
went missing in the Khumbu Valley

02:55.474 --> 02:56.940
on the Nepal side of the Himalayas.

02:56.975 --> 02:59.276
Now she was last seen with this outfit,

02:59.311 --> 03:02.546
The Spiritual Awakenings
Adventure Travel firm.

03:02.581 --> 03:04.814
Now they specialize in
high-end yoga expeditions.

03:04.849 --> 03:06.649
Yoga expeditions? That's a thing?

03:06.685 --> 03:09.086
Yeah, "Eat, Pray, Love,"
big business nowadays.

03:09.121 --> 03:10.652
Yeah, but not Eat, Pray, Love, Die,

03:10.688 --> 03:12.588
which is what happened in Meegan's case.

03:12.623 --> 03:16.425
Warning, these are a bit graphic.

03:16.461 --> 03:17.826
From the condition of the campsite

03:17.861 --> 03:19.562
and what was left of her body,

03:19.597 --> 03:22.298
initial science suggested
an animal attack.

03:24.284 --> 03:26.085
Yeah, these are horrific.

03:26.504 --> 03:29.637
Initial signs? You don't
think this was an animal?

03:29.672 --> 03:32.273
A local zoologist insisted
there are no natural predators

03:32.309 --> 03:34.109
in the Khumbu Valley, and
there've been no reports

03:34.144 --> 03:37.245
of migratory disturbances
in this area this year.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.522
So... murder?

03:38.584 --> 03:40.648
The Nepali government has classified

03:40.683 --> 03:44.585
Meegan Whitney's death
as the result of a...

03:44.620 --> 03:46.653
yeti attack.

03:46.688 --> 03:48.455
You have gotta be kidding me.

03:48.491 --> 03:50.324
I wish I was.

03:50.359 --> 03:52.493
Apparently, they
receive dozen of reports

03:52.528 --> 03:54.461
of yeti encounters each year.

03:54.497 --> 03:56.830
It's a legitimate cause
of death in the country.

03:56.865 --> 03:58.832
Well, I cannot imagine that
either the State Department

03:58.867 --> 04:02.668
or Meegan's family is
satisfied with blaming her death

04:02.703 --> 04:04.020
on a mythological creature.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.708
And that's why they reached out to us.

04:05.919 --> 04:07.006
So let me get this straight.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.474
We're being sent
halfway around the world

04:08.510 --> 04:09.342
to find out if this is a murder

04:09.377 --> 04:11.310
or if there's an animal on the loose

04:11.346 --> 04:12.445
that shouldn't be there?

04:12.480 --> 04:13.346
Or to actually find

04:13.381 --> 04:14.614
the Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas.

04:14.649 --> 04:17.649
Given the Nepali government's
official stance on the matter,

04:17.685 --> 04:21.620
let's consider the local
investigation as inconclusive.

04:21.654 --> 04:24.456
We hit the ground, we're
starting from square one.

04:24.491 --> 04:25.657
This was an American girl.

04:25.692 --> 04:29.661
We owe it to her and her family
to find out what happened.

04:34.385 --> 04:38.185

Synced and corrected by Dragoniod for

04:59.811 --> 05:01.740
A Buddhist proverb tells us,

05:01.805 --> 05:03.538
"There are only two
mistakes one can make

05:03.604 --> 05:04.920
"along the road to truth...

05:05.178 --> 05:08.680
not starting and not going all the way."

05:11.451 --> 05:12.618
Hey, Monty. Whatcha doin'?

05:12.653 --> 05:16.388
Optimizing this receiver's
multipath objection algorithm.

05:19.392 --> 05:21.191
Under normal circumstances,

05:21.227 --> 05:23.193
satellite transmissions
would be picked up directly

05:23.229 --> 05:26.931
by a terrestrial antenna, but
in the mountainous terrain,

05:26.966 --> 05:28.399
the signal reflects
off of rock faces and...

05:28.434 --> 05:33.570
And so you really are here
to work on communications?

05:33.605 --> 05:34.538
What else would I...

05:37.809 --> 05:39.275
Mayfield Ruth Jarvis.

05:39.310 --> 05:41.444
I may have let it slip
that you're a yeti believer.

05:41.479 --> 05:43.212
I'm sorry. It seemed relevant.

05:43.248 --> 05:44.814
I'm here for comm support.

05:46.251 --> 05:47.350
Okay, her description is inaccurate.

05:47.385 --> 05:50.553
I am not a "yeti believer."
I am at most an enthusiast.

05:50.588 --> 05:52.254
Tomato, tomato.

05:52.289 --> 05:54.557
I'm sorry. Call it scientific curiosity.

05:54.592 --> 05:58.226
I just don't see any evidence
disproving its actual existence.

05:58.262 --> 05:59.628
See? What'd I tell ya? Total believer.

05:59.664 --> 06:00.863
Totally.

06:00.898 --> 06:02.631
What have you been up to?

06:02.667 --> 06:04.366
We have been working up a victimology

06:04.401 --> 06:06.468
for Meegan Whitney.

06:06.503 --> 06:08.102
She seemed like a sweet girl.

06:08.137 --> 06:10.638
She was from a small town.

06:10.674 --> 06:13.374
Her family ran the local hardware store.

06:13.409 --> 06:14.576
Her parents, Tom and Edith,

06:14.611 --> 06:16.377
died three years ago in a car crash.

06:16.412 --> 06:18.446
Meegan spun out a little. Lost her way.

06:18.481 --> 06:20.381
That's understandable.

06:20.416 --> 06:22.149
And two years ago, she got into yoga.

06:22.185 --> 06:23.651
Found her center.

06:23.687 --> 06:24.281
Any enemies?

06:24.296 --> 06:25.343
Doesn't seem like it.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.554
Certainly not in
Middle-of-Nowhere, Nepal.

06:27.590 --> 06:29.322
But the police report
cleared her fellow trekkers,

06:29.357 --> 06:32.107
so if this was murder,
it wasn't pre-meditated.

06:32.138 --> 06:33.359
If it was murder,

06:33.395 --> 06:36.630
these crime scene
photos are inconclusive.

06:36.665 --> 06:39.432
There's nothing here to indicate
whether the killer is human

06:39.468 --> 06:41.601
or animal.

06:43.104 --> 06:44.269
There's a third option.

06:44.305 --> 06:47.773
Yeah, I think that we can
all agree it wasn't the yeti.

06:47.809 --> 06:49.475
Of course it was the yeti.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.745
Agent Garrett, the Nepali
people have plenty of experience

06:52.780 --> 06:54.279
with these kinds of incidents.

06:54.315 --> 06:55.447
We've been having them for centuries.

06:55.483 --> 06:59.283
Senani Thakur, no disrespect,
but have you considered

06:59.319 --> 07:00.952
any other possibilities?

07:00.988 --> 07:01.953
Why?

07:01.989 --> 07:04.089
The circumstances in
this case are consistent

07:04.124 --> 07:06.625
with every other yeti attack on record.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.494
None of which have been
scientifically confirmed.

07:09.529 --> 07:10.996
No mind.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.497
Today, it is our great honor

07:12.532 --> 07:15.299
to have the much-lauded
International Response Team

07:15.335 --> 07:18.035
here in Nepal to help us catch it.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.803
Oh, boy.

07:19.839 --> 07:23.674
Uh, your report indicated
that there were witnesses.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.644
Not to the attack itself, but, uh,

07:26.679 --> 07:28.646
one of her fellow trekkers
discovered the body

07:28.681 --> 07:30.147
the following morning.

07:30.182 --> 07:31.115
The expedition was called off.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.149
The survivors returned
here to Kathmandu.

07:33.184 --> 07:35.184
They're... they're
right here in this hotel.

07:35.219 --> 07:36.299
Now what happened to the body?

07:36.346 --> 07:38.287
Porters brought it down
with the expedition.

07:38.322 --> 07:41.024
It's being held in storage
at the army barracks.

07:41.059 --> 07:43.492
Porters? You had it carried down?

07:43.528 --> 07:45.728
Wouldn't you normally air lift it?

07:45.764 --> 07:47.130
My apologies, but Nepal is one of

07:47.165 --> 07:48.965
the poorest countries in Asia.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.299
My department has one helicopter.

07:51.334 --> 07:53.902
It was down for repairs.

07:53.937 --> 07:55.336
It seems to be working now.

07:55.372 --> 07:56.672
If you'd like, I can
arrange to have you taken up

07:56.707 --> 08:00.075
the mountain to the attack site
so you may examine it yourself.

08:00.110 --> 08:01.143
That would be fine, thank you.

08:01.178 --> 08:04.245
We'd also like to speak
with some of the witnesses.

08:04.281 --> 08:05.580
Whatever you require, sir.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.581
Good. Mae, while Clara and I do that,

08:07.616 --> 08:10.151
you can arrange to have
Meegan's body transferred

08:10.186 --> 08:12.763
- to the plane for supplemental autopsy.
- Sure thing.

08:12.802 --> 08:15.756
Monty, have you finished setting
up communications on the jet?

08:15.792 --> 08:16.957
Powered up and operational.

08:16.993 --> 08:19.160
Good. Then why don't you head
up the mountain with Simmons?

08:19.195 --> 08:21.862
You can establish a
satellite link at the scene.

08:21.898 --> 08:24.764
Up... the mountain

08:24.800 --> 08:28.101
in the... helicopter
that seems to be working?

08:28.136 --> 08:29.368
You'll be fine.

08:29.404 --> 08:30.603
And you thought the
big airplane was fun.

08:30.638 --> 08:32.337
Wait till you get a
load of the whirlybird.

08:35.744 --> 08:38.712
About those witnesses?

08:38.746 --> 08:41.179
I can't believe she's gone.

08:41.215 --> 08:43.716
We're so sorry for your loss.

08:43.751 --> 08:44.649
Thank you.

08:44.685 --> 08:46.351
Miss Gates, how did you and Meegan meet?

08:46.386 --> 08:49.221
We met in Bhutan in 2014.

08:49.256 --> 08:53.092
Um... she was really struggling
with the loss of her parents,

08:53.127 --> 08:54.559
and I was going through a messy divorce.

08:54.595 --> 08:56.762
And we just kinda hit it off.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.529
So back in the States, you were close?

08:58.564 --> 09:00.765
Kinda like camp friends, you know?

09:00.800 --> 09:03.101
Friends that you see not
so much on the day-to-day,

09:03.136 --> 09:05.737
but when you go away
together, you're inseparable.

09:05.772 --> 09:07.772
And you had done several
of these trips together.

09:07.807 --> 09:09.040
Oh, yeah.

09:09.075 --> 09:12.810
We went to Bali and, uh, Galápagos

09:12.846 --> 09:14.245
and Sri Lanka.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.579
We both came to Nepal earlier last year.

09:16.615 --> 09:18.749
We were so excited to get back here

09:18.784 --> 09:22.352
because it just seemed
so... transcendent.

09:25.255 --> 09:27.932
I just never thought anything
like this would happen.

09:27.979 --> 09:29.993
What else can you tell us
about Meegan's relationships

09:30.028 --> 09:31.794
with the other people on the retreat?

09:31.829 --> 09:33.662
Would anyone have wanted to hurt her?

09:33.697 --> 09:35.231
Oh, heavens no.

09:35.266 --> 09:37.666
We were all like this singular organism

09:37.701 --> 09:40.136
moving together, breathing as one.

09:40.171 --> 09:41.771
And yet, the night before Meegan died,

09:41.806 --> 09:43.973
she set up her tent away
from the rest of the group

09:44.008 --> 09:45.141
near the woods.

09:45.176 --> 09:47.843
Yes, she wanted to emulate the masters.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.078
The whole point of this
trip was to study with

09:50.113 --> 09:51.646
the local maharishi,

09:51.681 --> 09:53.648
A group of men that have chosen

09:53.683 --> 09:55.917
to live their lives in isolation,

09:55.952 --> 09:58.753
free of distractions from the world.

09:58.789 --> 10:01.956
And Meegan was obsessed with this idea.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.491
So she wanted to be more like them.

10:03.526 --> 10:05.660
Yes. Yes.

10:07.362 --> 10:08.896
And now she's dead.

10:10.490 --> 10:13.025
How does something so horrible happen?

10:15.004 --> 10:16.703
We have men at the site right now

10:16.738 --> 10:18.939
attempting to answer that question.

10:21.476 --> 10:22.509
Thought there'd be more snow.

10:22.544 --> 10:23.810
Yeah, we're still a couple thousand feet

10:23.845 --> 10:25.678
below the permafrost.

10:29.851 --> 10:32.484
This sure sets up like an animal attack.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.622
Remote location, victim ripped
apart where she was killed.

10:36.657 --> 10:37.990
Killer had patience.

10:38.026 --> 10:41.326
He took his time, waited
till she was alone.

10:41.361 --> 10:43.695
She's attacked here on
the outside of her tent,

10:43.730 --> 10:46.331
and she's dragged into the woods.

10:46.366 --> 10:48.200
And that's where she was disemboweled.

10:48.235 --> 10:50.802
Well, there were no
reports of screaming.

10:50.838 --> 10:55.173
So we can assume that whatever
it was, it got the jump on her.

10:55.209 --> 10:56.641
Yeah, well, look at the
distribution of blood here.

10:56.676 --> 10:57.908
The spatter here on
the outside of the tent,

10:57.944 --> 10:59.310
this is all from the attack.

10:59.345 --> 11:02.579
But the stuff here on the inside...

11:02.614 --> 11:04.514
All this is secondary transfer.

11:04.550 --> 11:06.884
Which means this tent was ransacked

11:06.919 --> 11:09.519
after Meegan was dead.

11:09.555 --> 11:12.223
Okay, wait, wait. If this was
an animal hunting its prey,

11:12.258 --> 11:13.490
it already has its food,

11:13.525 --> 11:15.758
there'd be no reason to go back inside.

11:15.793 --> 11:16.960
But on the other hand,

11:16.995 --> 11:19.495
if someone was trying to
make this look like an animal,

11:19.530 --> 11:21.731
or a yeti attack,

11:21.766 --> 11:23.900
it'd probably look a lot like this.

11:25.904 --> 11:27.036
I don't know, guys.

11:27.072 --> 11:29.873
If a human did this, they
did a pretty convincing job

11:29.908 --> 11:32.207
at making it look otherwise.

11:32.243 --> 11:35.677
I've got claw and bite marks here.

11:35.712 --> 11:38.446
It's clear signs of animal predation.

11:38.482 --> 11:39.514
I don't understand.

11:39.549 --> 11:41.183
I mean, why would someone
want to make this look

11:41.218 --> 11:42.751
like a yeti attack?

11:42.786 --> 11:44.452
Cover up a murder?

11:44.488 --> 11:46.188
Or to protect the area's reputation.

11:46.223 --> 11:48.189
A yeti attack plays more
to the Himalayan narrative

11:48.224 --> 11:49.924
than unsolved murder.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.025
Certainly, you don't mean to imply

11:51.060 --> 11:52.894
this is some kind of cover-up.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.696
Tourism is the number one
industry in this country.

11:55.731 --> 11:57.265
It's possible that
someone could've seen this

11:57.300 --> 11:59.733
as an opportunity to
generate some interest.

11:59.769 --> 12:01.903
What's that Occam's Razor
you people are so fond of?

12:01.938 --> 12:04.638
The simplest explanation
is usually correct.

12:04.673 --> 12:06.539
I tell you, this was the yeti.

12:06.574 --> 12:09.276
Yeah, well, the simplest
explanation usually doesn't

12:09.311 --> 12:10.810
assume the supernatural.

12:10.845 --> 12:12.946
And normally, I would
have DNA to rule it out,

12:12.981 --> 12:14.915
but unfortunately, given
the number of people

12:14.950 --> 12:17.884
that handled the body
bringing it down the hill,

12:17.920 --> 12:19.986
isolating the killer
is gonna be impossible.

12:20.022 --> 12:24.756
Okay, if this was an animal,
do you know what kind it was?

12:24.792 --> 12:27.126
No, the decomp is so extensive.

12:27.161 --> 12:28.961
I mean, I can't even tell
if this damage was done

12:28.996 --> 12:30.829
Peri or postmortem.

12:30.864 --> 12:33.999
I mean, it's even possible that
a scavenger fed off of her body

12:34.035 --> 12:35.801
after she was already dead.

12:35.836 --> 12:36.735
I am sorry, guys.

12:36.770 --> 12:38.503
This doesn't seem to be narrowing down

12:38.539 --> 12:40.104
the way I thought it would.

12:40.140 --> 12:41.973
All right, well, it's
still early up here.

12:42.008 --> 12:43.507
We're gonna search the woods,

12:43.543 --> 12:44.976
see if there's anything
the local authorities

12:45.011 --> 12:46.244
might've missed.

12:46.279 --> 12:47.812
Okay, can you give me a hand?

12:47.847 --> 12:49.480
I wanna roll her over.

12:56.055 --> 12:58.455
Well, that's weird. Her hips are loose.

12:58.490 --> 13:00.824
Yoga does promote flexibility.

13:00.859 --> 13:02.559
Well, not this much.

13:09.234 --> 13:11.301
All of her joints are loose.

13:13.037 --> 13:13.869
And once I realized that

13:13.904 --> 13:14.937
her pelvic ligaments were loose,

13:14.973 --> 13:16.772
it led me to Relaxin,

13:16.807 --> 13:18.607
which is a vasodilator.

13:18.642 --> 13:21.543
It softens cartilage and loosens joints.

13:21.579 --> 13:23.112
You think she was drugged?

13:23.147 --> 13:24.680
No Relaxin isn't a pharmaceutical.

13:24.715 --> 13:28.017
It is a hormone that is
released when a body prepares

13:28.052 --> 13:29.852
to incubate a fetus.

13:29.887 --> 13:31.019
Meegan was pregnant.

13:31.054 --> 13:34.055
And the initial autopsy
didn't discover it because

13:34.091 --> 13:35.890
all of her internal organs
were already missing.

13:35.925 --> 13:40.328
But HCG levels suggest that
she was about 13 weeks along.

13:40.364 --> 13:43.031
That would mean
conception occurred during

13:43.066 --> 13:44.299
her last trip to Nepal.

13:44.334 --> 13:47.901
And that someone has a personal
relationship with the victim.

13:47.936 --> 13:50.837
- It could explain the overkill.
- It might mean that

13:50.873 --> 13:53.040
the disembowelment
wasn't part of a cover-up.

13:53.075 --> 13:55.476
I mean, what if Meegan
went to surprise someone

13:55.511 --> 13:57.944
with the news of the pregnancy,
and it didn't go well?

13:59.948 --> 14:02.883
Ms. Gates, were you aware
that Meegan was pregnant?

14:02.918 --> 14:03.814
What?

14:03.817 --> 14:05.448
We checked with the other
trekkers registered

14:05.453 --> 14:06.719
with Spiritual Awakenings.

14:06.754 --> 14:10.990
None of them were in Nepal when
you and Meegan came this year.

14:11.026 --> 14:14.060
Do you know of anyone else
who might be the father?

14:14.095 --> 14:15.995
No.

14:16.031 --> 14:17.363
I can't think of anyone.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.732
You said she was obsessed
with the maharishi.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.433
Were they part of the expedition?

14:21.468 --> 14:23.402
No. They were locals.

14:23.437 --> 14:25.237
Sort of like guest instructors?

14:28.875 --> 14:29.941
Well, Jack, you were right.

14:29.976 --> 14:31.876
According to Spiritual Awakenings,

14:31.912 --> 14:34.913
a man named Yogi Pemba
led the class the morning

14:34.948 --> 14:35.980
that Meegan was murdered.

14:36.016 --> 14:38.016
Now I did some digging,
and Pemba's real name

14:38.051 --> 14:39.950
is Dave Dennis.

14:39.985 --> 14:42.053
And he is from Bakersfield, California.

14:42.088 --> 14:43.887
Well, given the name
change, let me guess...

14:43.923 --> 14:45.556
Dave Dennis has a record.

14:45.591 --> 14:47.591
Yes, sir.

14:47.626 --> 14:50.894
In 2005, he fled the
U.S. after a yoga student

14:50.930 --> 14:54.031
with whom he had been,
ahem, "bumping chakras,"

14:54.067 --> 14:56.099
filed domestic assault
charges against him.

14:56.134 --> 14:59.769
So if this Pemba is the father
of a child he didn't want...

14:59.804 --> 15:01.971
He would have both
motive and opportunity.

15:02.006 --> 15:04.274
You got a 20 on this wayward shaman?

15:04.309 --> 15:07.810
According to the website,
he lives in Namche Bazaar,

15:07.845 --> 15:09.979
not far from where Meegan was murdered.

15:10.014 --> 15:13.248
Call Simmons and Monty, see
if they can pay him a visit.

15:13.284 --> 15:15.117
No, they're not the same.

15:15.152 --> 15:17.719
The sasquatch is a hoax perpetuated by

15:17.754 --> 15:19.988
cryptozoologists in a way to justify

15:20.023 --> 15:21.445
their so-called profession.

15:21.477 --> 15:24.326
Right, so let me get this straight.

15:24.361 --> 15:26.828
You think that Bigfoot is a...

15:26.863 --> 15:28.997
A cash grab. Just follow the money.

15:29.032 --> 15:32.166
I mean, besides, the yeti
is a legend that dates back

15:32.202 --> 15:33.201
to pre-history.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.169
It was supported by, you
know, Reinhold Messner

15:35.205 --> 15:37.271
and Sir Edmund Hillary.

15:37.307 --> 15:41.209
Sure, sure. Makes total sense.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.610
Monty, are you there?

15:44.914 --> 15:46.980
Mae, tell me there's no
poison sumac in Nepal.

15:47.015 --> 15:48.648
We got a suspect.

15:48.683 --> 15:49.882
It's a Dave Dennis,

15:49.918 --> 15:51.651
a.k.a. "Yogi Pemba."

15:51.686 --> 15:54.687
He lives in a town called Namche Bazaar.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.659
Okay, yeah, that's not
too far from where we are.

15:59.694 --> 16:02.695
I'll round up Simmons,
and we'll go check it out.

16:02.731 --> 16:04.963
Uh, yo, Simmons, we got a lead.

16:08.336 --> 16:09.368
Matt?

16:15.276 --> 16:19.645
Uh, Mae, it's a
little... creepy out here.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.179
Be nice to have some company.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.215
What was that?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.220
Damn it.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.822
Simmons?

16:34.461 --> 16:37.094
Matt?

16:40.466 --> 16:42.199
I'm out. No.

16:42.234 --> 16:43.867
No. Unh-unh.

16:43.902 --> 16:45.469
Absolutely not.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.938
- Hey.
- Aah!

16:48.974 --> 16:50.840
Where were you?!

16:50.876 --> 16:52.276
Breathe.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.177
Look, Mae called, and
Jack wants us to go find

16:54.212 --> 16:55.244
some guy named Yogi Pemba.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.845
Pemba didn't do it.

16:56.881 --> 16:59.615
How do you know?

16:59.651 --> 17:02.585
Well, if the neck
tattoo is to be believed,

17:02.620 --> 17:05.588
this is Pemba.

17:18.269 --> 17:20.493
The same bite marks
and the same mutilation.

17:20.954 --> 17:22.655
So whatever killed Meegan Whitney

17:22.691 --> 17:23.618
also killed Pemba.

17:23.690 --> 17:25.392
Given the proximity to her campsite,

17:25.425 --> 17:28.415
I'd say they were killed
at or around the same time.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.985
Yeah, decomp would support that.

17:30.165 --> 17:32.766
But lucky for us, up
here, the temps are cooler,

17:32.802 --> 17:34.000
and it looks like the shade of the trees

17:34.036 --> 17:36.804
has kept this body in better
condition than the first one.

17:39.274 --> 17:42.242
You ever assist with a field autopsy?

17:42.277 --> 17:43.510
It's not really on my bucket list.

17:43.546 --> 17:45.778
Yeah, well, it is now.

17:51.886 --> 17:53.018
So what did the police report say

17:53.054 --> 17:54.787
about the monks at the monastery?

17:54.810 --> 17:57.122
That they didn't see anything.
They were genuinely unhelpful.

17:57.158 --> 17:58.524
Well, it probably has
something to do with

17:58.560 --> 17:59.992
the tenuous relationship
that Buddhists have

18:00.027 --> 18:02.694
with Nepal's mostly Hindu government.

18:02.729 --> 18:04.963
This guy was local. They know something.

18:04.998 --> 18:06.097
Wanna go check it out?

18:10.671 --> 18:13.338
So let's step this out.

18:13.373 --> 18:16.475
After her morning yoga,
Meegan returns to her tent,

18:16.510 --> 18:18.642
alone.

18:18.678 --> 18:21.178
The UnSub stalks her
from the cover of woods.

18:21.213 --> 18:22.379
When the time is right...

18:22.414 --> 18:23.881
He attacks.

18:23.916 --> 18:25.048
Meegan goes down.

18:25.084 --> 18:27.351
The UnSub drags her into the woods.

18:27.386 --> 18:29.119
While he's ripping her body apart...

18:29.154 --> 18:30.320
Pemba arrives.

18:30.356 --> 18:32.490
He spots the attacker, too late.

18:33.772 --> 18:34.737
Pemba runs.

18:34.805 --> 18:36.671
The killer gives chase.

18:36.677 --> 18:37.742
And Pemba makes it pretty
deep into the woods,

18:38.096 --> 18:41.063
so the killer probably
isn't moving that fast.

18:41.099 --> 18:44.166
But something must've
slowed the Yogi down.

18:54.912 --> 18:57.145
Pemba loses sight of the killer.

18:57.180 --> 18:59.347
And he thinks

18:59.383 --> 19:01.884
he may have gotten away.

19:01.919 --> 19:04.753
So rather than give away
his position by moving,

19:04.788 --> 19:07.890
he hides out, until...

19:18.134 --> 19:20.935
The way that the flesh
is torn from the bone,

19:20.970 --> 19:23.037
eating the internal organs, I mean,

19:23.072 --> 19:25.406
everything about this screams predator.

19:25.441 --> 19:29.242
But these bite marks are...

19:29.277 --> 19:31.578
- human?
- That didn't sound too convincing.

19:31.613 --> 19:33.513
Well, they're the right size

19:33.549 --> 19:35.281
with the appropriate
inter-dental spacing,

19:35.316 --> 19:37.450
but the teeth that did this were jagged,

19:37.485 --> 19:39.052
like you find in a carnivore.

19:39.087 --> 19:41.621
Or in cases of extreme dental attrition.

19:41.657 --> 19:44.890
So... human-oid?

19:44.926 --> 19:46.959
I'm just trying to keep an open mind.

19:46.994 --> 19:48.794
Well, one thing is for
sure. This wasn't a cover-up.

19:48.829 --> 19:52.031
The UnSub did not hesitate.
He just bit right in.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.966
This was his nature.

19:54.001 --> 19:55.534
Here. Come over and take a look.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.937
I'll take your word for it.

19:57.972 --> 20:00.072
But see, then the problem
is that means cannibal.

20:00.107 --> 20:03.274
And cannibals are almost
always ritualistic.

20:03.309 --> 20:05.577
Their kills are planned and ceremonial.

20:05.612 --> 20:07.712
This was instinctive.

20:07.747 --> 20:09.781
In-human.

20:09.816 --> 20:12.116
Monty, the killer is not

20:12.151 --> 20:13.451
an 8-foot tall Abominable Snowman.

20:13.486 --> 20:15.486
Thanks, Scully, but neither is the yeti.

20:15.521 --> 20:18.589
This is something we like
to call the dragon paradox.

20:18.624 --> 20:21.658
Okay. Fine. Dragon paradox. What is it?

20:21.694 --> 20:24.227
Okay, imagine a knight
goes on an adventure

20:24.262 --> 20:25.690
and he takes his party,

20:25.721 --> 20:29.099
but everyone in the party
dies except for the knight.

20:29.134 --> 20:31.001
You play too much D&D.

20:31.036 --> 20:32.502
Beaten and bloodied,

20:32.537 --> 20:36.171
he has to return to the
castle to explain his defeat.

20:36.207 --> 20:40.142
Kneeling in the throne room,
does our knight tell the king

20:40.177 --> 20:43.178
that the monster that
ravaged his entire party

20:43.214 --> 20:46.082
was 4-feet tall and walked with a limp?

20:46.117 --> 20:48.450
No. He tells the king that
the monster was 20 feet tall

20:48.486 --> 20:50.086
and he breathed fire.

20:50.121 --> 20:53.788
Exac... Why... does he do that?

20:53.824 --> 20:55.423
Well, because he is the brave knight,

20:55.458 --> 20:58.159
and losing to a short, green gimp

20:58.194 --> 20:59.828
would ruin his reputation.

20:59.863 --> 21:02.130
Come on. With everything
you know about victimology?

21:02.165 --> 21:05.000
Okay, no. No, no.

21:05.035 --> 21:08.202
The knight has sworn to be honest

21:08.238 --> 21:10.104
and honor his king,

21:10.139 --> 21:12.439
but he still exaggerates because...

21:12.474 --> 21:14.775
Because post-traumatic
memories are unreliable.

21:14.810 --> 21:17.011
So the size of the
monster that he remembers

21:17.046 --> 21:18.878
represents the size of the threat.

21:18.925 --> 21:23.150
Which is why we think
the yeti is 8 feet tall

21:23.185 --> 21:25.218
when most scientific theories suggest

21:25.254 --> 21:26.653
that it's the missing link

21:26.688 --> 21:30.123
or an offshoot of some
feral homo sapien.

21:30.158 --> 21:33.960
Either of which would
make it human-sized.

21:33.995 --> 21:35.170
Exactly.

21:35.248 --> 21:38.397
There's only one problem.

21:38.432 --> 21:40.033
There's no such thing as a yeti.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.756
Those men should not be here.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.425
Their guns will bring death.

22:08.460 --> 22:12.096
It will anger Chomolungma.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.765
The Mother Goddess of the world.

22:14.801 --> 22:18.601
Lama Vajra, death has
already come to the Khumbu.

22:18.636 --> 22:20.802
I heard.

22:20.895 --> 22:21.871
A woman

22:21.907 --> 22:27.110
and a man who called himself "Pemba."

22:27.145 --> 22:29.779
So you knew him.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.548
We were... familiar.

22:34.885 --> 22:37.285
Do you know who the killer is?

22:37.321 --> 22:39.554
The army thinks it's a yeti.

22:39.590 --> 22:42.457
The army is interested
only in confirming

22:42.492 --> 22:44.727
what it already believes.

22:44.762 --> 22:47.229
So you do know who killed him.

22:47.264 --> 22:51.699
I don't suppose karma is the
answer you're looking for.

22:53.502 --> 22:56.804
Pemba was a charlatan, a false prophet.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.742
What he brought to this
valley was unnatural.

23:00.777 --> 23:03.778
And nature has a way of
taking care of itself.

23:03.813 --> 23:07.281
There any chance you had
a hand in this "nature"?

23:07.316 --> 23:10.150
I swear to you that I did not.

23:10.185 --> 23:12.085
I do not know who this killer is,

23:12.121 --> 23:14.287
but... I caution you.

23:14.322 --> 23:18.759
Larger forces than man
or beast are at play here.

23:20.262 --> 23:23.329
Chomolungma is not to be trifled with.

23:23.365 --> 23:25.765
And if you interfere with her will,

23:25.800 --> 23:29.135
she can be merciless.

23:29.170 --> 23:32.471
Thank you. I will keep that in mind.

23:32.506 --> 23:34.439
Is there anything else you can give me?

23:36.343 --> 23:38.244
Here.

23:43.150 --> 23:45.349
A blessing,

23:45.385 --> 23:47.485
to ward off evil.

23:50.390 --> 23:51.756
Namaste, Miss Seger.

24:09.008 --> 24:10.740
Jack, I got a print.

24:13.378 --> 24:16.946
Three toes, cleft.

24:16.981 --> 24:20.283
Evidence of partial amputation.

24:20.318 --> 24:22.185
It could be human.

24:22.220 --> 24:23.652
Or abominable.

24:23.688 --> 24:25.721
You joke.

24:25.756 --> 24:28.825
This isn't gonna do much
to settle the locals.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.964
Here's another one.

24:38.035 --> 24:39.000
Yeah.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.139
Well, at least we got
a clear path. We could...

24:44.174 --> 24:45.506
try to follow these things.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.477
Oh, no.

24:50.512 --> 24:52.313
Stop! Stop! Don't move!

24:53.382 --> 24:55.582
What do you mean "destroying evidence"?

24:55.617 --> 24:56.717
The UnSub's trail leads here.

24:56.752 --> 24:58.853
Your men are contaminating the area.

24:58.888 --> 25:01.021
I can assure you, these
men are the finest hunters

25:01.057 --> 25:02.356
on the planet.

25:02.391 --> 25:04.391
For animals, maybe,
but we're hunting a man.

25:04.426 --> 25:06.893
The behaviors are
fundamentally different.

25:06.928 --> 25:07.994
Animals run on instinct.

25:08.029 --> 25:09.662
This killer can think strategy.

25:09.697 --> 25:11.430
He laid in wait for his victims.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.100
We're not gonna catch him by
wandering around in the woods.

25:14.135 --> 25:15.801
We have to adapt our
pursuit to his mind-set.

25:15.837 --> 25:18.938
Senani Thakur, this man
is a world-class tracker.

25:18.974 --> 25:20.940
You'll have a better chance
of catching this monster

25:20.976 --> 25:22.441
if you listen to him.

25:24.345 --> 25:27.445
The man that we are searching
for has been injured.

25:27.481 --> 25:29.647
This is a photo of his footprint.

25:29.683 --> 25:31.783
Now he appears to have
a partial amputation

25:31.818 --> 25:33.618
of his right foot.

25:33.653 --> 25:36.788
And you can tell by the weak
leading edge of this print

25:36.823 --> 25:38.290
that he's probably dragging his leg.

25:38.325 --> 25:41.592
The first thing we do is
divide the area into quadrants.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.460
Now you'll start by
looking for broken branches.

25:43.496 --> 25:45.162
Look for pieces of clothing.

25:45.198 --> 25:48.399
Anything that may indicate
where he may have passed.

25:48.434 --> 25:49.833
Now note the
directionality of the break.

25:49.869 --> 25:52.010
That will help tell you
which way he's headed.

25:52.025 --> 25:54.272
Now remember, this killer probably knows

25:54.307 --> 25:55.306
that we're tracking him.

25:55.341 --> 25:58.641
So he's gonna use cunning,
he will use deception

25:58.676 --> 26:00.977
to try to throw us off his path.

26:01.013 --> 26:03.513
Now it's been just over
48 hours since he was here.

26:03.548 --> 26:05.748
We have fallen leaves,
loose debris that may have

26:05.784 --> 26:07.350
covered these prints up.

26:07.386 --> 26:10.520
Be aware of them.

26:10.555 --> 26:13.489
Hey! Hey!

26:42.986 --> 26:45.954
Gather your men. We'll check it out.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.880
Well, I think it's safe
to say that Meegan and Pemba

27:59.915 --> 28:02.171
aren't the killer's first victims.

28:02.241 --> 28:04.451
That explains the
lack of hesitation in his kills.

28:04.487 --> 28:05.652
I mean, this guy's practiced.

28:05.688 --> 28:07.988
Mae said she had parts for
at least six different bodies

28:08.023 --> 28:10.122
she and Monty were taking down the hill.

28:10.157 --> 28:12.231
Some of them looked like
they'd been here a while.

28:12.262 --> 28:13.659
Dead animals.

28:13.695 --> 28:15.160
I think he's trying to store them.

28:15.196 --> 28:17.797
Well, winter's coming.
Food's gonna be scarce.

28:17.832 --> 28:18.965
Something's not right.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.535
Cannibals don't usually
hoard their victims for food.

28:22.570 --> 28:25.170
Dahmer... didn't he keep his
victim's heads in his fridge?

28:25.206 --> 28:26.204
Yeah, but as trophies.

28:26.239 --> 28:28.206
And for sexual gratification.

28:28.241 --> 28:30.542
The behavior says one thing,
forensics says another.

28:30.577 --> 28:32.577
I tell ya, at this point,

28:32.613 --> 28:33.745
I'm willing to start giving

28:33.780 --> 28:34.813
Monty's wild theories some credence.

28:34.848 --> 28:36.681
It's gotta be one or the
other. Which one is it?

28:36.717 --> 28:39.183
Animal or human?

28:41.722 --> 28:44.321
It's human.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.163
Animals don't collect souvenirs.

28:57.302 --> 29:00.236
Your blessings didn't work.

29:00.271 --> 29:02.038
Did they not?

29:02.073 --> 29:03.606
We found more bodies
in a cave near here.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.575
Each of them was wearing
one of your bracelets

29:05.610 --> 29:07.506
when they died.

29:07.608 --> 29:09.178
That is unsurprising.

29:09.213 --> 29:13.249
We give those to every
visitor who stops by.

29:13.284 --> 29:15.718
Are you here to accuse me?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.686
I tell you again, I am no killer.

29:17.721 --> 29:20.722
But you do know more
than you're letting on.

29:20.758 --> 29:22.791
Why didn't you tell me
about the other victims?

29:22.826 --> 29:26.762
Miss Seger, do you know how
many people died in this valley

29:26.797 --> 29:29.965
- in the last year?
- Of course. The earthquakes.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.767
There has been suffering and death

29:31.802 --> 29:32.768
throughout the Khumbu.

29:32.803 --> 29:36.070
Yet you are concerned
with a handful of souls

29:36.105 --> 29:37.237
who did not belong here.

29:37.273 --> 29:39.707
Is that why you're not helping us?

29:39.742 --> 29:41.642
- Because they were outsiders?
- To the contrary.

29:41.678 --> 29:46.179
I am not indifferent to
the suffering of any man.

29:46.218 --> 29:49.383
But nature has spoken.

29:49.418 --> 29:51.117
Who am I to question nature?

29:51.152 --> 29:53.286
There's a killer out there
who needs to be stopped.

29:53.321 --> 29:55.622
You cannot stop Samsara.

29:55.657 --> 30:00.827
It is an endless cycle of
destruction and rebirth.

30:00.862 --> 30:02.829
Do you know what
happens to those who fail

30:02.864 --> 30:04.064
to reach enlightenment?

30:04.099 --> 30:09.334
Yeah, when someone dies, they
return as a lower life form.

30:09.369 --> 30:13.639
And they begin a descent
into the realm of the beast.

30:13.674 --> 30:16.308
Okay, we get it. You didn't like them.

30:16.343 --> 30:19.778
Jack, we have been
spending all of this time

30:19.814 --> 30:23.616
trying to decide whether our
killer is human or animal.

30:23.651 --> 30:26.350
He's telling us it's both.

30:26.385 --> 30:29.120
Thousands died in the earthquakes,

30:29.155 --> 30:32.456
and you think one of them was
reincarnated as the killer.

30:32.492 --> 30:35.259
There are many forms of rebirth.

30:35.294 --> 30:38.696
Jack, what if he didn't die?

30:38.732 --> 30:41.099
What if our killer was
injured during the earthquake,

30:41.134 --> 30:42.699
but he survived?

30:42.735 --> 30:45.435
There have been some
accounts about people who have

30:45.470 --> 30:47.671
developed into an animalistic state

30:47.706 --> 30:51.474
after suffering a severe
neurological trauma.

30:51.510 --> 30:53.343
Would that explain the cannibalism

30:53.378 --> 30:55.779
- and the hoarding?
- It might.

30:55.814 --> 30:59.849
If so, we may be looking
for an instinct-driven

30:59.884 --> 31:02.151
atavistic killer.

31:02.186 --> 31:04.787
And here I thought you
did not believe in yeti.

31:08.359 --> 31:10.726
Mae, are you there?

31:10.762 --> 31:13.996
Jack, this is the worst
case of mix and match ever.

31:14.032 --> 31:16.731
Look, we have reason to believe
that the UnSub may be someone

31:16.767 --> 31:19.734
who was injured in
last year's earthquakes.

31:19.770 --> 31:20.535
Well, it'd fit our timeline

31:20.570 --> 31:22.347
based on what we've got down here.

31:22.371 --> 31:23.705
Yeah, it looks like all of these victims

31:23.740 --> 31:25.640
disappeared within the last year.

31:25.676 --> 31:27.208
Any luck with identities?

31:27.243 --> 31:28.509
Well, based on the expedition patches

31:28.545 --> 31:29.744
that were found on some of the clothing,

31:29.780 --> 31:31.980
several of them could've been
from a Swiss trekking group

31:32.015 --> 31:33.647
that went missing about six months ago.

31:33.683 --> 31:36.684
Jack, how much trauma would
it take to turn a normal person

31:36.719 --> 31:37.718
into someone...

31:39.055 --> 31:41.055
Gotta go. Call you back.

31:41.090 --> 31:42.923
What happened?

31:42.958 --> 31:44.658
I don't know. I was inside.

31:46.428 --> 31:49.496
He says it was the yeti.

31:49.531 --> 31:50.830
Go. I got him.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.665
Come on.

31:54.235 --> 31:56.435
Go, go!

31:56.470 --> 31:58.437
You're gonna be okay.

31:58.472 --> 32:00.873
This is the last set from the sequencer.

32:00.909 --> 32:02.075
Well, you were right.

32:02.110 --> 32:03.409
I isolated nine different sets of DNA.

32:03.444 --> 32:04.777
Six are from the Swiss expedition.

32:04.813 --> 32:06.412
I haven't found matches
for two of the others,

32:06.447 --> 32:08.847
although, genetic markers do
indicate they may be local.

32:08.882 --> 32:10.648
So there may not be a match.

32:13.286 --> 32:15.553
What about this one?

32:15.589 --> 32:17.089
It's common to all parties

32:17.124 --> 32:20.548
and it was found in
the bite marks on Pemba.

32:20.657 --> 32:21.927
That's your killer.

32:21.962 --> 32:24.361
Western European markers
as well as Polynesian.

32:24.396 --> 32:27.765
The 2015 quake was his trigger.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.968
And I use that as a filter
with missing persons.

32:34.841 --> 32:36.540
Monty, you are a genius.

32:39.746 --> 32:42.245
Oh, man. This poor guy lost everything.

32:42.280 --> 32:45.014
This guy isn't evil. He's injured.

32:46.752 --> 32:49.953
Call Jack. I know where he's going.

32:49.988 --> 32:51.487
Jack, you there?

32:52.958 --> 32:55.258
Jack?

32:55.293 --> 32:56.362
What do we do?

32:56.385 --> 32:58.961
Call the army. Order us up a chopper.

33:10.165 --> 33:12.007
You know, the problem
with the DOD is they design

33:12.042 --> 33:13.275
everything for desert warfare.

33:13.310 --> 33:17.078
If they just understood that 20%
of the planet was mountainous,

33:17.113 --> 33:19.814
then... ah! Got it.

33:19.849 --> 33:21.482
Jack, do you read?

33:24.988 --> 33:27.721
This way.

33:28.992 --> 33:31.525
So you really ain't have
nothing else but this red coat?

33:34.229 --> 33:35.962
Monty, it's Jack. Go ahead.

33:35.998 --> 33:37.497
We got the DNA on the killer.

33:37.532 --> 33:40.600
It's an Ian Wilson.
He's from New Zealand.

33:40.635 --> 33:43.170
Uh, 2015 earthquake
triggered an avalanche

33:43.205 --> 33:46.339
that wiped out his entire
mountain climbing expedition.

33:46.374 --> 33:48.974
Authorities assumed that
everyone in the expedition died

33:49.010 --> 33:50.810
including Ian and his wife.

33:50.845 --> 33:52.611
But somehow, he survived.

33:52.646 --> 33:54.780
Jack, he's not a monster.

33:54.816 --> 33:57.016
He's a very damaged individual.

33:57.051 --> 33:58.851
He attacked one of the
Nepalis. We're tracking him.

33:58.886 --> 34:00.172
Where are you now, Mae?

34:00.211 --> 34:02.188
Uh, we are at the base of the avalanche,

34:02.223 --> 34:04.623
where his wife was killed.

34:14.935 --> 34:16.620
He's been here.

34:17.170 --> 34:20.071
About a kilometer that way.

34:20.106 --> 34:22.172
Stick tight, Mae. We're on our way.

34:28.112 --> 34:29.847
Jack, he's here.

34:35.275 --> 34:37.454
Mr. Wilson?

34:37.512 --> 34:38.745
We know who you are.

34:41.849 --> 34:43.849
You're hurt.

34:43.884 --> 34:45.984
And we can help you, please.

34:48.355 --> 34:49.570
There's no need to be scared.

34:49.632 --> 34:52.489
Speak for yourself.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.726
I'm gonna put my gun down.

34:55.761 --> 34:56.893
Are you crazy?

34:59.265 --> 35:00.998
You do this every week?

35:01.033 --> 35:02.733
Agent Garrett, yeti or no,

35:02.768 --> 35:05.369
he is a monster
responsible for many deaths.

35:05.404 --> 35:08.004
This man is suffering
from a neurological trauma.

35:08.039 --> 35:10.273
Charging in and killing
him is not justice.

35:10.308 --> 35:11.730
We need to try to apprehend him.

35:11.769 --> 35:14.043
If threatened, my men will respond.

35:14.079 --> 35:16.212
If they are threatened.
Those are my agents up there.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.780
They have this situation under control.

35:17.815 --> 35:18.729
Tell your men.

35:25.076 --> 35:26.341
This is bad.

35:26.556 --> 35:27.956
The yeti myth is part of their identity.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.259
Any move he makes will
be seen as aggression.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.207
Mae, you're about to have company.

35:32.285 --> 35:35.797
Ian, there are men coming
and they wanna hurt you.

35:35.832 --> 35:39.067
Please, this is what
Charlotte would've wanted.

35:39.103 --> 35:40.935
He can't understand you.

35:45.841 --> 35:48.109
Maybe I should shut the hell up.

35:51.005 --> 35:53.480
We know about the avalanche
that killed your wife.

35:57.519 --> 36:01.087
The search party looked
for you for three days,

36:01.123 --> 36:03.890
but they had to turn back
because of the aftershocks.

36:06.622 --> 36:07.921
You could hear them, couldn't you?

36:13.761 --> 36:17.000
I cannot imagine the pain,

36:17.547 --> 36:19.413
the feeling of abandonment.

36:19.448 --> 36:22.516
But, Ian, killing is not the answer.

36:24.754 --> 36:26.754
Stay back.

36:26.790 --> 36:28.022
We have it under control.

36:28.058 --> 36:31.892
Ian, please. Come with us.

36:31.927 --> 36:34.549
We can get you help.

36:38.133 --> 36:39.933
Ian, no, please.

37:58.041 --> 37:59.908
Namaste.

38:09.319 --> 38:10.952
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

38:10.988 --> 38:14.021
Well, I guess that puts
the yeti myth to bed

38:14.056 --> 38:15.656
once and for all.

38:17.626 --> 38:20.995
I doubt it brings much
comfort to Meegan's family.

38:21.030 --> 38:23.964
But they do have some closure.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.502
You know, I have to admit that
when I saw those footprints,

38:28.537 --> 38:31.004
even I started to believe a little bit.

38:31.039 --> 38:34.874
I can't imagine what it took
to survive an injury like that.

38:34.910 --> 38:36.911
Well, that speaks to the
strength of the human spirit.

38:37.176 --> 38:40.379
Yeah, but was he? You know, human?

38:40.415 --> 38:43.149
Having devolved to such
an animalistic state?

38:43.185 --> 38:44.550
I think so.

38:44.585 --> 38:46.485
I think on some level
he knew what he was doing

38:46.521 --> 38:47.986
when he charged those men.

38:48.022 --> 38:49.521
You think he wanted to die?

38:49.556 --> 38:52.504
I think he was suffering.

38:52.668 --> 38:54.738
I think he wanted to be with his wife.

38:54.754 --> 38:56.795
You know, there's this Buddhist concept

38:56.831 --> 39:00.966
called Kalyana-mittata,
or spiritual companionship.

39:01.001 --> 39:05.881
And they say that it
transcends death or rebirth.

39:06.873 --> 39:09.073
Well, maybe he got what he wanted.

39:09.108 --> 39:10.908
Maybe he did.

39:10.944 --> 39:12.210
You know, technically,
this doesn't disprove

39:12.245 --> 39:13.811
the evidence of the yeti.

39:13.847 --> 39:16.192
There could still be
undiscovered species out there.

39:16.231 --> 39:18.015
- Hey, Monty.
- Yes, sir.

39:18.051 --> 39:19.050
Enough with the yeti.

39:21.686 --> 39:24.054
- Let's go home.
- Yes, please.
