Since DODC is already here,
we obviously can't outrun them,

14:45.208 --> 14:49.500
so we distract and stall as long as
possible until Kamran's safe. Got it?

-Yeah, it was really cool.
-It was so cool!

35:20.791 --> 35:23.708
-It was really, really cool.
<i>-She's a freaking action superhero.</i>

35:23.791 --> 35:25.041
<i>Mad skills.</i>

35:25.125 --> 35:28.708
<i>But I don't know where those skills went</i>
<i>when she dropped me and broke my leg.</i>

35:28.791 --> 35:31.916
<i>-Guess I was the beta test.</i>
<i>-Come celebrate this Friday.</i>

35:32.000 --> 35:34.125
<i>Celebrate our own superhero.</i>

35:34.208 --> 35:37.583
<i>Free ice-cream pizza.</i>
<i>After</i> salah, <i>of course. Yeah.</i>

36:12.000 --> 36:13.125
YUSUF: Kamala?

36:14.583 --> 36:15.666
Kamala?

36:16.291 --> 36:18.041
Hey, <i>beta.</i> What are you doing here?

36:18.125 --> 36:19.375
Whoa.

36:20.791 --> 36:24.333
Oh, my God. This is really scary.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.083
Yeah, right.

36:26.166 --> 36:27.375
(GRUNTS)

36:27.750 --> 36:29.083
(SPEAKS URDU)

36:30.000 --> 36:31.083
Phew.

36:32.166 --> 36:33.333
(IN ENGLISH) Nice.

36:35.666 --> 36:41.083
So, you are now the great
new superhero called...

36:42.333 --> 36:45.583
-Called what?
-I'm still figuring it out.

36:46.250 --> 36:47.708
Of course you are.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.875
Yeah, we're all still figuring it out.

36:52.750 --> 36:55.166
<i>But you saved people, Kamala.</i>

36:57.375 --> 37:00.750
Heaviest thing I ever picked up.
I saw Damage Control agents all around,

37:00.833 --> 37:02.666
so I spun around
and shot them in the face.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.708
-YUSUF: <i>You saved lives.</i>
-The balconies aren't safe.

37:04.791 --> 37:06.833
We need to fix that.
Are you writing that down?

37:09.250 --> 37:11.375
YUSUF: <i>And if you saved one life...</i>

37:17.291 --> 37:20.375
<i>Well, you saved the world.</i>

37:28.291 --> 37:30.291
Do you know why we named you Kamala?

37:34.000 --> 37:37.375
Your mother and I tried for years
to have a second child.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.625
We'd almost lost all hope.

37:42.791 --> 37:44.333
And then you came.

37:45.541 --> 37:49.916
<i>Beta,</i> you were just so perfect.

37:52.041 --> 37:56.291
That's what <i>kamal</i> means in Arabic.
"Perfect."

37:57.291 --> 37:59.791
But in Urdu, it's more like...

37:59.958 --> 38:01.083
What's the word?

38:01.708 --> 38:04.500
"Wonder." "Marvel."

38:07.375 --> 38:09.541
<i>Kamal</i> means marvel.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.333
I share the same name
as Carol fricking Danvers?

38:14.416 --> 38:16.083
(CHUCKLES) I don't know who that is.

38:17.458 --> 38:21.500
But you sure are and always have been

38:22.833 --> 38:26.458
our own little Ms. Marvel.

38:36.333 --> 38:37.916
I love you.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.250
Love you, too.

38:47.958 --> 38:49.583
(ENERGY PULSATING)

38:54.250 --> 38:55.500
Magic.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.625
Absolute magic.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.708
BRUNO: Yo.

39:51.791 --> 39:52.958
(KAMALA LAUGHS)

39:53.041 --> 39:56.166
-Are you kidding me?
-Kamran left his car.

39:56.250 --> 39:57.458
I see that.

39:57.541 --> 39:59.625
Obviously, he had to be
snuck out of the country.

39:59.708 --> 40:02.458
-I mean, he told me I could have it.
-No, he didn't.

40:02.541 --> 40:03.750
-Yes, he did.
-No, he did not.

40:03.833 --> 40:05.708
Yes. We really bonded
in that explosion, okay?

40:05.791 --> 40:08.000
I look good driving it.
Probably take it to Caltech.

40:08.583 --> 40:13.458
I, for one, think that it looks much
better on the streets of Jersey City

40:13.541 --> 40:16.083
-without you in it, to be honest with you.
-No.

40:16.166 --> 40:19.750
-Yes, I for two.
-No. No. I, for three, disagree.

40:19.833 --> 40:21.583
(ALL LAUGHING)

40:22.458 --> 40:24.375
I'm proud of you. Really.
I'm gonna miss you.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.333
I will only be a 43-hour drive away.

40:26.625 --> 40:29.583
Oh, also, I need to tell you something.

40:29.666 --> 40:33.375
Okay. So, I went back and looked at
your genetic make-up again.

40:33.458 --> 40:36.125
Bruno, you know
you can call me when you're bored.

40:36.208 --> 40:40.291
No. No, no. Aamir kept asking
if he might have powers, too.

40:40.375 --> 40:44.416
And I think we might've had it wrong
the first time around.

40:44.958 --> 40:46.041
What do you mean?

40:46.125 --> 40:49.708
So, we know why you have access to
the <i>Noor</i> and how you can wield it,

40:49.791 --> 40:53.500
but when I compared you to the rest of
your family, something still seemed off.

40:53.958 --> 40:55.333
Okay.

40:56.375 --> 41:00.041
Kamala, there's something
different in your genes.

41:00.833 --> 41:01.833
Like...

41:03.291 --> 41:04.666
Like a mutation.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.791
(EXHALES)

41:13.375 --> 41:15.791
Whatever it is,
it's just gonna be another label.

41:17.333 --> 41:18.458
Keys, please.

41:20.625 --> 41:23.500
-Fine.
-(HORN HONKS)

41:23.833 --> 41:25.791
Get in, losers. We're getting shawarma.

41:25.875 --> 41:27.916
-I love you!
-Hey, how did you get my keys?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.041
NAKIA: Feels good.
Now I guess we're both Caltech kids.

41:30.125 --> 41:33.375
Yeah, whatever. One ride. That's it. Okay.

41:33.458 --> 41:36.500
KAMALA: Listen, I'm the only one
who's actually driven this thing.

41:36.583 --> 41:39.458
-Ten and four, right now.
-NAKIA: It was some myth. Ten and four.

43:39.875 --> 43:42.458
MUNEEBA: That does not
sound like science to me.

43:42.541 --> 43:44.208
(SIGHS) Okay.

43:46.708 --> 43:48.333
(BANGLE TINGLING)

43:55.791 --> 43:57.083
(GASPS)

43:58.666 --> 44:00.291
(GROANS)

44:14.416 --> 44:15.875
Oh, no, no, no.
