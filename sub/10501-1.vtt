00:02.003 --> 00:07.341
<i>At the end of the last century,
on northern Europe's coasts,</i>

00:07.425 --> 00:09.844
<i>lived men who feared neither God
nor the law.</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:15.349
<i>They lured ships towards the rocks
where they were smashed to pieces.</i>

00:15.433 --> 00:18.519
<i>These men then plundered the wrecks.</i>

00:19.103 --> 00:21.480
<i>They were called wreckers.</i>

00:21.564 --> 00:24.567
<i>The captain is their leader.
He is a brute.</i>

00:24.650 --> 00:27.570
<i>His strength gives him power
over his henchmen.</i>

00:27.653 --> 00:31.991
<i>He has committed so many crimes
that he's become almost mad.</i>

00:32.491 --> 00:36.120
<i>Villagers say he is haunted
by the ghosts of his victims.</i>

00:36.203 --> 00:39.165
<i>His madness makes him dangerous
and unpredictable.</i>

00:39.999 --> 00:45.171
<i>Le Bosco, cursed by all navies,
the bad seed of any crew.</i>

00:45.254 --> 00:48.257
<i>He landed there dead-drunk
from a foreign ship one night</i>

00:48.340 --> 00:50.926
<i>with his bag on his shoulder.</i>

00:51.010 --> 00:52.803
<i>He follows the captain,</i>

00:52.887 --> 00:57.475
<i>but this sailor, never without his knife,
dislikes taking orders.</i>

00:57.850 --> 01:00.061
<i>He bides his time like a vulture.</i>

01:00.144 --> 01:01.979
<i>He is false and crafty.</i>

01:02.521 --> 01:05.357
<i>Paul.
He, too, is a former sailor.</i>

01:05.691 --> 01:10.154
<i>He suffers the captain's orders,
but grovels to Le Bosco.</i>

01:10.237 --> 01:12.406
<i>He will be on the winner's side.</i>

01:12.490 --> 01:13.991
<i>He is cruel and cowardly</i>

01:14.075 --> 01:17.828
<i>and has a worse temper than the others.</i>

01:17.912 --> 01:22.458
<i>He is the strongest, because each
of the three thinks he is on his side.</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:25.795
<i>Tina, the wrecker.
The angel of the accursed.</i>

01:25.878 --> 01:29.924
<i>Wild and perverted.
This cruel animal is always ready</i>

01:30.007 --> 01:33.844
<i>to snap up the innocent
who come too close to her she-wolf jaws.</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:35.679
<i>She will show no pity.</i>

01:35.763 --> 01:39.934
<i>It's a game for her to plunder wrecks
and kill survivors.</i>

01:40.017 --> 01:43.729
<i>More than one dead man,
his throat cut,</i>

01:43.813 --> 01:49.026
<i>takes with him the image of her
magnificently shameless naked body.</i>

06:55.582 --> 06:57.292
Help.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.355
Something wrong, Captain?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.028
Leave me alone.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.489
Look

19:16.573 --> 19:20.034
- Hey, clear off, you drunk.
- Get lost.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.612
Now what's the matter?
Have you gone mad?

19:56.654 --> 19:58.198
There.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.075
A moment ago.
Didn't you see anything?

20:01.618 --> 20:03.786
Here? I'm the only one here.

20:25.767 --> 20:28.353
Are you afraid of ghosts, Captain?

20:41.199 --> 20:45.495
I thought I saw something.
lt's nothing. lt's nothing.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.292
It's nothing.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.891
Sounds like he saw a ghost.

21:08.101 --> 21:12.146
- Maybe there was a ghost.
- Just for him?

21:12.689 --> 21:15.984
Yes. Just for him.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.398
<i>Help!</i>

22:31.434 --> 22:33.436
Bring us some drinks.

22:37.440 --> 22:41.986
- A ship has been wrecked on the rocks.
- A ship? When?

22:42.904 --> 22:44.781
Only a few hours ago.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.408
How do you know?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.994
Were you there?

22:50.078 --> 22:53.039
It was tricked by lights
guiding it into the rocks.

22:53.122 --> 22:57.377
- To cause a shipwreck? On purpose?
- Of course it was on purpose.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.961
Shut up.

22:59.045 --> 23:02.006
You know very well
there are no wreckers anymore.

23:02.965 --> 23:07.011
Who knows? The tide may have
washed up the bodies.

23:07.095 --> 23:10.473
I asked you if you were there.

23:11.432 --> 23:17.355
- What about you? Were you there?
- Me? No.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.316
I was here.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.277
So, why have you got blood
on your shirt?

23:29.158 --> 23:31.661
You're mad.
There's nothing there.

23:33.955 --> 23:36.958
God curse the wreckers.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.843
The sun is rising over the shore.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.929
A sad and grey day.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.849
The tide is out.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.519
I can see two small figures.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.564
They are getting up.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.484
- They start walking.
- That's enough.

24:04.902 --> 24:08.823
- Shut up.
- They are still weak.

24:09.824 --> 24:13.327
They support each other
and stagger forward.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.455
Be warned.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.041
If they discover the secret
of this cursed village,

24:19.125 --> 24:22.211
nothing will stop them
from taking revenge.

24:58.414 --> 25:02.293
Let the ghosts come.
I'm not afraid of anyone.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.378
Let them come and see the captain.

25:10.510 --> 25:15.598
God or devil.
Come and have your throats slit.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.642
Come on, then.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.686
Come on, ghosts.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.775
Come on, phantoms.
Come on, demons.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.403
Come back and see the captain.
I challenge you.

25:30.738 --> 25:34.534
You died tonight.
I will kill you again.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.995
We have to shut him up
or he'll tell them everything.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.664
He's drunk again.

25:39.747 --> 25:43.167
I saw your heads smashed
against the rocks!

26:38.347 --> 26:40.516
What the hell is going on?

26:46.188 --> 26:48.065
I don't want any trouble here.

26:48.149 --> 26:52.236
It's morning. We're closing now.
Finish your drinks and go.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.707
<i>It happened one windy night</i>

27:04.790 --> 27:07.960
<i>It happened one stormy night</i>

27:08.044 --> 27:11.672
<i>Crashed on the rocks, a stray ship</i>

27:11.756 --> 27:15.551
<i>Leaves two beautiful innocent girls</i>

27:15.635 --> 27:18.638
<i>A celebration of beauty</i>

27:18.721 --> 27:21.932
<i>A celebration of beauty</i>

27:22.725 --> 27:26.020
<i>Some accursed men
were wandering about</i>

27:26.103 --> 27:29.398
<i>Full of wine and alcohol</i>

27:29.482 --> 27:33.527
<i>They plundered the wrecks at night</i>

27:33.611 --> 27:37.865
<i>Innocence destroyed by rape</i>

27:38.574 --> 27:41.702
<i>A celebration of beauty</i>

27:41.786 --> 27:45.414
<i>A celebration of beauty</i>

27:54.632 --> 27:57.051
I should've killed that bastard.

27:59.095 --> 28:04.100
- What are you going on about, Louise?
- lt's only a song, Bosco.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.977
A story about wreckers.

28:08.646 --> 28:11.399
There are no wreckers nowadays.

28:11.774 --> 28:14.151
It's just a song.

28:17.113 --> 28:21.283
As long as it's just a song.
I don't want to hear your damn song.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.453
It makes me sick! Bloody hell.

28:32.962 --> 28:36.632
There's a curse on this village.
The demons are free.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.676
What did you see?
Tell me.

28:38.759 --> 28:42.555
There were two ghosts.
They were staggering about.

28:42.638 --> 28:46.767
Pale and covered in blood,
with crazed eyes.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.896
- There were two women.
- Where did you see them?

28:50.980 --> 28:55.067
Over there, by the ship cemetery,
near the haunted ruins.

28:55.151 --> 28:58.154
Come with me, you two. Hurry.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.332
The devil has been set free.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.127
God help us.

29:14.336 --> 29:17.006
He has been imprisoned in the ruins
for centuries.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.301
Now he is free.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.387
Misfortune is upon us.

29:24.138 --> 29:27.433
I can sense that he's still in the ruins.

29:28.225 --> 29:33.022
Maybe now
his long wait will be over.

30:56.522 --> 31:00.526
They're here.
We must drive them out.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.903
They won't come out alive.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.865
- What if they are ghosts?
- There are no ghosts.

31:05.948 --> 31:10.870
That's enough. If they are alive,
they must be exhausted.

31:10.953 --> 31:12.705
We'll easily catch them.

31:12.788 --> 31:15.207
- We must try to capture them alive.
- Why?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.501
I want to finish them off.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.505
Over here. I can see them.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.179
Give me that.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.731
Stupid bitches.

33:16.203 --> 33:19.456
- They've gone.
- They're in one of the wrecks.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.792
We can't search all the wrecks.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.586
Did you see anything, Bosco?

33:25.170 --> 33:28.632
I haven't seen them.
They must still be here.

33:28.716 --> 33:33.345
- We must wait until daybreak.
- We'll find them eventually.

33:33.429 --> 33:37.016
I know how to drive them out.
Paul, bring your lamp.

33:37.099 --> 33:40.394
Come here, all of you.
Le Bosco has an idea.

33:41.103 --> 33:42.896
You come down too.

33:44.273 --> 33:46.775
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

33:51.989 --> 33:54.867
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to burn them.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.952
Give me your lantern.

34:12.134 --> 34:14.636
Stay here and tell me
if you see them.

36:49.791 --> 36:52.127
Come on, we have to find Tina.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.029
There they are.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.449
There they are.
They're heading for the ruins.

38:45.532 --> 38:47.868
The cursed ruins.
You mustn't go there.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.661
Let me go.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.002
Look. They're over here.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.517
They're over here with me.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.437
Come back.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.984
Don't go over there.

40:08.115 --> 40:10.575
Stop. Don't go over there.

40:11.451 --> 40:12.953
Come back.

40:19.341 --> 40:21.352
Follow me.

40:22.671 --> 40:24.339
Come on.

40:29.261 --> 40:31.972
- Come on.
- Don't go there.

40:32.055 --> 40:35.392
Let go of me. Let me go.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.853
Leave me. Don't touch me.

40:38.395 --> 40:42.983
Leave me alone. I want to get them.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.610
I want to kill them.

40:45.694 --> 40:48.321
For God's sake, let me kill them.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.367
Let go of me.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.372
Don't go there.

41:03.420 --> 41:08.091
Come back here. lt's high tide.
You'll be caught in the seaweed.

41:08.175 --> 41:14.598
You'll be killed. You mad?
Don't go to the ruins. Come back.

44:20.867 --> 44:23.203
They were in the marshes.

44:24.996 --> 44:29.334
They are wounded.
Let me take care of them.

44:29.959 --> 44:33.421
- I'll look after them.
- All right.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.966
You knew the risk you were taking
bringing them here.

44:37.676 --> 44:39.427
It's too late now.

44:39.969 --> 44:43.723
Look after them so they can rest.
I'll speak to them afterwards.

45:46.286 --> 45:48.079
I know you are there.

45:48.163 --> 45:49.664
You saw them.

45:52.250 --> 45:55.003
They can set you free if they wish.

45:55.587 --> 45:57.964
But you're the one who has to wait.

45:59.632 --> 46:02.635
They have to come
of their own free will.

46:03.344 --> 46:06.306
I've seen how pure they are.

46:06.848 --> 46:09.434
How innocent they are.

46:10.351 --> 46:12.479
I won't intervene,

46:12.562 --> 46:16.191
but I beg you to spare them.

46:22.781 --> 46:24.407
So be it.

46:24.824 --> 46:27.869
Let destiny be fulfilled.

46:49.557 --> 46:52.227
Don't you want to play,
Madame Louise?

46:53.770 --> 46:56.147
Last night ended in tragedy.

46:56.231 --> 46:59.859
- What happened?
- There was a shipwreck.

46:59.943 --> 47:02.904
And the captain
thought he saw the ghosts.

47:03.738 --> 47:06.741
Le Bosco was also acting strangely.

47:07.325 --> 47:10.787
- And at dawn -
- What happened at dawn?

47:11.246 --> 47:16.042
They were in the marshes
near the haunted ruins at dawn.

47:16.125 --> 47:17.585
And now-

47:18.461 --> 47:20.338
There they are.

47:20.922 --> 47:23.424
How do you know all of this?

47:23.508 --> 47:26.219
I just know.

47:29.597 --> 47:31.766
What if they're still alive?

47:32.350 --> 47:34.519
For God's sake, shut up.

47:36.813 --> 47:40.525
The captain has shut himself
in his house. He's afraid.

47:40.608 --> 47:42.986
You're all insane.

47:45.488 --> 47:50.326
You know what's hidden away in the ruins.
If they made it there -

47:50.410 --> 47:53.454
Two girls. Wounded and exhausted.

47:53.997 --> 47:56.499
I think they must have drowned.

47:56.583 --> 47:58.209
I hope so.

47:59.294 --> 48:02.255
If they are hiding in the ruins
and they free-

48:02.338 --> 48:04.340
Don't mention his name.

48:12.140 --> 48:15.310
We don't really know
what's hiding in the ruins.

48:15.393 --> 48:16.811
Yeah.

48:16.895 --> 48:21.232
But if they manage to get that far...

48:23.484 --> 48:25.820
what will happen?

48:30.491 --> 48:34.287
All I know is that no one has been there
for at least a century.

48:34.829 --> 48:38.207
Shut up! You don't know
what you're talking about.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.377
- Do you understand?

48:50.261 --> 48:52.305
Stop it.

48:55.391 --> 48:59.020
That's enough from you.
Come here with me instead.

49:00.563 --> 49:02.148
With you?

49:03.691 --> 49:05.568
All right.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.890
They can no longer speak.

49:36.933 --> 49:39.477
We have to help them.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.562
You're the only one
who can help them.

49:42.689 --> 49:44.607
I will save you.

49:45.191 --> 49:47.276
I will give you back peace.

49:47.860 --> 49:50.321
You needn't be afraid of us.

49:51.406 --> 49:56.285
The ludicrous costume helps keep
the villagers away from the ruins.

49:56.703 --> 49:59.622
As for me,
I'm the keeper of this tomb.

50:00.289 --> 50:04.043
Try to tell me how I can assist you.

50:40.288 --> 50:41.789
Revenge.

50:41.873 --> 50:44.751
You are free to take your revenge.

50:45.793 --> 50:51.424
The one supposed to be in this tomb
is trapped somewhere in these ruins.

50:51.507 --> 50:56.888
He can only be liberated
by innocent hands, by victims of evil.

50:56.971 --> 51:02.643
Tonight he will call you.
He knows you are here.

51:03.561 --> 51:06.689
It's up to you
whether or not you want to set him free.

51:07.231 --> 51:12.904
Only he can give you the means
to take revenge and find peace again.

51:13.404 --> 51:16.991
But he's a black angel,
a demon wearing a habit.

51:17.075 --> 51:21.245
If you set him free,
you will also release his dark forces

51:21.329 --> 51:24.540
which have been locked away
for a century now.

51:25.416 --> 51:30.213
The entity imprisoned in these ruins
can be very dangerous.

51:30.296 --> 51:33.633
Right now he's possessed.
Evil lives within him.

51:35.009 --> 51:38.429
The one behind the door is two-faced.

51:38.513 --> 51:42.016
You can find peace there, or death.

51:42.100 --> 51:46.854
It's up to you now.
You can expect him to call you tonight.

51:58.574 --> 52:00.201
Stop fidgeting.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.453
I know they will return.

52:02.537 --> 52:06.457
Until I touch their corpses
with my own hands,

52:07.583 --> 52:09.335
I won't believe they are dead.

52:10.169 --> 52:12.547
Where do you expect them to be?

52:14.924 --> 52:17.051
They're dead, I tell you.

52:17.802 --> 52:20.388
It's as if I can see them.

52:20.721 --> 52:23.349
I can feel them watching me.

52:24.851 --> 52:28.229
Their spirit is searching my head
to find me.

52:28.312 --> 52:31.566
Their hatred won't leave me.

52:31.941 --> 52:34.360
I know they will return.

52:34.902 --> 52:37.697
They can think
of nothing else but me.

52:38.698 --> 52:41.284
They're looking for me
in order to take their revenge.

52:42.910 --> 52:46.455
Dead or alive,
I know they will be back.

52:46.539 --> 52:49.167
I know they will be back.

52:51.586 --> 52:53.754
I saw them in the tavern.

52:56.257 --> 52:58.968
They were covered in blood.

53:00.052 --> 53:02.013
They were watching me.

53:06.350 --> 53:09.604
You don't care, do you?
You weren't there.

53:36.631 --> 53:38.674
You don't believe in ghosts.

53:40.301 --> 53:42.094
You're nothing but a trollop.

54:42.530 --> 54:44.991
No, you can't make me forget them.

54:51.122 --> 54:53.040
They will kill us.

54:55.376 --> 54:57.712
They came back from the dead...

55:00.965 --> 55:03.175
to tear us apart.

55:06.846 --> 55:10.224
Good for them if they are alive.

55:12.226 --> 55:16.856
I will kill them
like wicked creatures.

55:16.939 --> 55:18.691
I want to strangle them.

55:19.275 --> 55:22.570
I want to feel their bones
breaking between my fingers.

55:22.653 --> 55:26.490
I want to overpower them,
drink their blood and wounds.

55:26.574 --> 55:30.328
I'll smash them with my heels
and you'll be there to see it.

55:30.411 --> 55:32.163
There will be nothing left of them.

55:32.246 --> 55:35.541
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

56:25.174 --> 56:29.136
I tell you I saw them,
as clear as I see you now.

56:29.220 --> 56:33.140
The captain's gone completely beserk.
He should be locked up.

56:33.224 --> 56:35.142
He's becoming dangerous.

56:42.817 --> 56:45.653
Everyone seems to know about it.

56:45.861 --> 56:50.491
News travels fast around here.
People are staying indoors.

56:52.493 --> 56:56.580
- There's no way they can know.
- We've said too much.

56:57.164 --> 57:01.585
There's that sailor
who saw the girls in the ship cemetery.

57:01.669 --> 57:05.131
What about Louise,
did she see anything?

57:06.173 --> 57:08.843
Louise? Yes, Perhaps.

57:09.635 --> 57:11.762
She has second sight.

57:27.528 --> 57:29.864
Tragedy is upon the village.

57:30.948 --> 57:32.867
Tonight he will be free.

57:32.950 --> 57:34.702
Who do you mean?

57:35.286 --> 57:37.872
The one who hides in the ruins.

57:38.539 --> 57:40.499
I can see him.

57:41.041 --> 57:42.543
He is waiting.

57:44.253 --> 57:45.921
He is calling.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.530
I can see you.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:23.203
Open this door, so the devil's fury
may be unleashed on this cursed land.

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:27.666
Let the death of us all
be the price of your life.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:31.295
Unleash all the forces of evil upon us.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:35.382
I will give you the power.
Go on.

01:00:53.734 --> 01:00:55.235
That's it.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:58.405
Now open the door.

01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:01.992
Good.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.745
He is free.

01:01:56.714 --> 01:01:59.258
You came when I called to you.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:04.513
I am free and you will sacrifice
your bodies to me. Come.

01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:11.145
You say nothing,
but you speak to me with your minds.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:17.192
I will give you all my power,
so that you may carry out your revenge.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:11.481
You may go.
Now I am within you.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:15.609
You have all of my power
until sunrise.

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:20.240
Once the daylight comes,
you will be just as weak as you were before.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:25.787
Go now. You only have a few hours
to carry out your revenge.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.237
They're alive. I saw them.

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:00.780
Poor things.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:04.367
So, Louise, who did you see?

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:06.578
Tell us what you know.

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:08.872
I didn't see anyone.

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:11.750
But I do know everything
that happened.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.710
That's the way I am.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.129
I know things I have never seen.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:19.424
I've heard about
your gift of second sight.

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:21.134
Are they alive?

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:24.346
- They're alive.
- Where are they?

01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:26.932
Right here.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.733
- No, Bosco.
- Calm down.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:39.152
Captain, stop him.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.768
So there you are, my children.

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:38.229
You are very much as I imagined.

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:42.442
Yes, I've seen you before.
Here, in my head.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:44.444
What's your name?

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:48.281
You don't want to tell me.

01:12:49.449 --> 01:12:52.243
What about you? How old are you?

01:12:52.327 --> 01:12:54.579
I see. You're not very talkative.

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.123
Are you hungry?

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.544
Thirsty?

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.131
Good, that's a start.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.718
But I would like
to hear the sound of your voice.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.390
Maybe you aren't able to speak.

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:16.976
Is that it? Are you mute?

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:23.316
Poor wretches, they are mute.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.236
Monique, bring them some grenadine.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:41.418
I understand.
You have to leave.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:45.213
Let me look at you a while longer.

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:48.466
I'm afraid I may never see you again.

01:13:50.385 --> 01:13:52.804
Listen, I would never betray you.

01:13:53.847 --> 01:13:56.683
You can always think of me as a friend.

01:13:57.892 --> 01:13:59.686
Are you afraid of those girls?

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:02.564
Cowards. Cowards.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:05.275
You're running away.
You're terrified.

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:08.194
I'm not afraid of them. I'm going.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.531
I'll bring you back their heads.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.794
Where are they?

01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:29.299
- I'm not afraid. I want them.
- They just left for the hills.

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:32.260
Would you shut your mouth, bitch.
Who asked you?

01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:40.239
Help me.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:36.838
Beware, the sailors were here.

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:38.840
They were completely drunk.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.969
Save yourselves.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:05.486
There is nothing I can do.
I have no more power left.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:12.994
Yes, I can save them by myself

01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:15.955
if you wait here until daybreak.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:20.334
You will keep them alive until then.

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:24.505
My powers will leave you
and return to me. I will save them.

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:32.263
Yes, I know what will happen.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.810
You will be left powerless
against your enemies.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.896
You will be quite defenceless.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:42.648
But they will live thanks to you.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:49.989
That's good.

01:21:50.489 --> 01:21:52.742
It's nearly dawn.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:57.121
Leave as soon as it's light.

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.916
Try to save yourselves.

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:01.751
They will live.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:08.257
Your revenge escapes you.

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:12.178
In this crazy world

01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:16.390
the only thing that might possibly
be left for you is generosity.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:10.403
- Do they have to die?
- In a short while.

01:23:10.987 --> 01:23:13.489
I would like to save them.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:16.242
They gave us their lives.

01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:18.577
Can't you help them?

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.582
Nothing can save them now.

01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:27.878
No, I cannot leave the ruins.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:31.007
But their revenge will be carried out.

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:34.969
The four pirates are condemned.
They will perish.

01:23:36.804 --> 01:23:38.848
We will go to meet them.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:41.100
You will be too late.

01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:43.436
That doesn't matter.

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:10.059
We've finally got you.
You will die here!

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:15.981
You little she-devils.
No magic can save you this time.

01:28:03.237 --> 01:28:05.906
Stupid whores.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.924
Take advantage of them again.

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:27.172
Tear it.

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:38.559
More. Go on.

01:30:41.854 --> 01:30:43.439
Tear.

01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:04.960
Trash.

01:31:06.962 --> 01:31:08.672
Bitch.

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:11.341
Here I go, slut.

01:31:13.594 --> 01:31:16.388
Hit the sluts.

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:21.894
Blood. Oh, yes.

01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:25.022
It's going to hurt.

01:32:34.925 --> 01:32:37.135
Hurts, doesn't it?

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:46.103
Arching-

01:32:52.818 --> 01:32:54.361
You liked it?

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:01.655
Stop it. Are you insane?

01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:04.449
What are you doing?
Are you mad?

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.639
What have I done?

01:37:34.224 --> 01:37:36.852
They're going to drown.

01:37:46.945 --> 01:37:49.322
They're innocent.

01:37:51.283 --> 01:37:53.285
Innocent

01:37:54.305 --> 01:38:00.491
