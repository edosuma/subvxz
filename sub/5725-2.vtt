WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:07.308
(music playing,
everyone whooping)

00:10.444 --> 00:12.480
WOMAN: I don't know,
what do you think?

00:13.481 --> 00:15.649
(laughing):
Look at this one.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.551
The one with the Mohawk!

00:17.585 --> 00:18.552
WOMAN 2:
No way! I was into that guy!

00:18.586 --> 00:19.453
MAN: So far, so good, right?

00:19.487 --> 00:21.255
Right? Like, it, right? Yeah?
I like it.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.690
MAN: Yeah?
WOMEN: Yeah.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.891
*

00:23.924 --> 00:26.260
MAN 2: 20 feet away and you know
my weakness for redheads.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.795
WOMAN:
This redhead! Partner!

00:27.828 --> 00:29.263
MAN 2: It's a match.
It's a match.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.764
WOMAN: Oh, my God.
MAN 2: Check it out.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.700
MAN 3:
Look at this! It's perfect!

00:32.733 --> 00:34.068
RAMIREZ: How'd you
find this place?

00:34.102 --> 00:35.736
On an app called "Run-A-Tab."

00:35.769 --> 00:36.670
This is what you've been missing

00:36.704 --> 00:38.806
when you've been working
every Friday night.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.242
Major male hotness.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.479
Ew!

00:45.513 --> 00:47.381
Except for this loser.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.483
Is he "hearting"
every woman in here?

00:49.517 --> 00:51.752
Do you remember when a guy
would buy you a drink,

00:51.785 --> 00:54.255
start an actual conversation?

00:54.288 --> 00:55.389
Nope!
(laughing)

00:55.423 --> 00:57.091
(loudly):
Hi!

00:57.125 --> 00:58.092
Hi!

00:58.126 --> 01:00.461
Uh, can I get you
another one?

01:00.494 --> 01:02.630
Uh, it's just a soda.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.864
Perfect!

01:03.897 --> 01:06.467
We have something
in common already.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.202
I have 64 days.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.840
Six months.

01:12.873 --> 01:13.807
Congrats.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.876
Thank you.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.877
So, uh...

01:16.910 --> 01:18.379
uh, do you go to meetings?

01:18.412 --> 01:21.382
It's called anonymous
for a reason.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.350
(laughing):
Right, right.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.817
Sorry.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.519
This is all just new to me.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.456
Look, you're really sweet,

01:28.489 --> 01:32.293
but you should know I have
a boyfriend... so...

01:32.326 --> 01:33.361
(anxious laugh)

01:33.394 --> 01:34.795
Oh!

01:34.828 --> 01:36.330
Okay.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.398
Um...

01:37.431 --> 01:38.332
Enjoy your night.
Good night.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.401
Bye.
Bye.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.538
(snickers)

01:44.572 --> 01:45.539
A boyfriend?!

01:45.573 --> 01:47.175
I didn't want
to lead him on.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.376
I just wasn't feeling it.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.279
But this guy...

01:51.312 --> 01:53.714
Oh, hell to all the yeses.

01:53.747 --> 01:54.682
What?!

01:54.715 --> 01:56.850
You are so popular
on HeartMate.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.420
Most of these guys don't
get past the texting phase.

02:00.688 --> 02:01.655
(wry laugh)

02:01.689 --> 02:03.424
Hey.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.326
MAN:
You are so hot.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.794
Want to hang out?
Want to get out of here?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.398
I got no plans.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.632
Want to be with you.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.404
Hi!
(laughs) It's for us.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.820
OPERATOR: 911.
What is your emergency?

02:32.853 --> 02:35.389
I-I heard gunshots
and screaming.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.757
My, uh, my neighbor...

02:36.790 --> 02:38.659
she's-she's in danger.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.728
I-I think the guy's
still in there.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.196
P-Please hurry!

02:43.231 --> 02:45.533
(siren wails in distance)

02:55.409 --> 02:56.176
(SWAT officers shouting)

02:56.210 --> 02:57.645
Go, go, go, go!
(woman screaming)

02:57.678 --> 02:59.413
Stay where you are!
Tracy!

02:59.447 --> 03:00.147
OFFICER:
In the back room!

03:00.180 --> 03:01.749
OFFICER 2:
Right where you are!

03:01.782 --> 03:03.217
Now! Now! Move!
Clear!

03:03.251 --> 03:04.252
Clear!

03:15.663 --> 03:16.897
(indistinct, overlapping
conversations)

03:16.930 --> 03:18.899
NELSON: Any leads on who
SWATed you last weekend?

03:18.932 --> 03:21.469
Still no.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.471
I feel really bad about
what happened, Raven.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.972
I could tell by
your stealth getaway

03:25.005 --> 03:27.308
down the fire escape when
SWAT busted down my door.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.643
Okay, look, you said it
three times now.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.512
You've reminded me every
day since it happened.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.315
I did it to protect
you... us.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.884
The police report that puts me
in your apartment at 3:00 a.m.?

03:36.917 --> 03:40.354
Yeah, you were...
smart to leave.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.322
It just sucked.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.292
RUSSELL:
Aw, this is amazing.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.294
(Ryan laughs)

03:46.327 --> 03:47.695
Baby pacifiers?!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.297
Are congratulations in order?

03:49.330 --> 03:50.030
You, uh...

03:50.063 --> 03:50.964
you flatter me.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.466
These things are so cool.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.767
They're Bluetooth-enabled

03:53.801 --> 03:55.669
pacifiers, from England.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.305
Here, let me...

03:57.338 --> 03:58.672
Hold this.

03:58.706 --> 03:59.940
The teat can measure
temperature...

03:59.973 --> 04:03.544
knows its own location,
and then it tracks

04:03.577 --> 04:05.746
the medications that
you're giving your child...

04:05.779 --> 04:07.381
and then all that information

04:07.415 --> 04:09.383
is sent back
to the parent's phone.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.453
Or in this case,
my tablet.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.456
37 degrees Celsius.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.291
(chuckles)
98.6 Fahrenheit.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.992
Perfect toasty
body temperature.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.494
I thought I'd have Raven
check these out

04:20.528 --> 04:21.895
for vulnerabilities.
How you doing?

04:21.929 --> 04:23.764
We got an update on the
infamous Garth Rizzo.

04:24.798 --> 04:25.766
Who's that?

04:25.799 --> 04:26.967
Garth Rizzo-- otherwise known

04:27.000 --> 04:29.903
as the most hated man
on the Internet.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.572
He's been running
a revenge porn site

04:31.605 --> 04:33.641
called ShamedExxx.com,
for a year now.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.043
He victimizes innocent women
by posting

04:36.076 --> 04:37.911
their private naked photos
on his blog,

04:37.945 --> 04:39.547
and recently,
he went from uploading

04:39.580 --> 04:41.449
two photos a day, to ten.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.584
He's averaging about
20 million views a week.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.653
Unfortunately, we can't arrest
him for being a scumbag.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.820
We've been going
after him for months,

04:46.854 --> 04:48.322
but he's got
a squeaky-clean record,

04:48.356 --> 04:49.623
and an army of lawyers.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.659
KRUMITZ: And he's got
a ton of followers.

04:51.692 --> 04:52.593
They call themselves "shamers."

04:52.626 --> 04:54.662
They've basically turned
Rizzo into a god.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.529
How's he get their photos?

04:55.563 --> 04:57.097
Well, guys send him
photos of their exes

04:57.130 --> 04:59.433
to make themselves feel
better after being dumped.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.601
And Rizzo's just decided
that these women

05:00.634 --> 05:02.536
(phone ringing)
needed to be put on blast.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.838
And we can't just
take down the site?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.674
The DOJ's attorney's
hands are tied.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.510
Technically, Rizzo's not
breaking any laws.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.579
Same rights that protect our
freedom of speech protect Rizzo.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.347
Yeah, the only way
we can arrest him

05:13.381 --> 05:15.616
is to prove that he hacked the
devices to obtain the photos.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.385
I don't suppose we can
get a warrant for search.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.519
MUNDO:
Not until we can prove

05:18.552 --> 05:19.620
he's doing
something illegal.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.655
So we have to prove that
he's doing something illegal

05:21.689 --> 05:23.691
so we can take a look
at his devices,

05:23.724 --> 05:25.393
but to look at his devices,
we have to prove

05:25.426 --> 05:26.660
he's doing
something illegal.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.995
That's a nice Catch-22.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.664
(phone ringing)

05:30.698 --> 05:31.799
Raven, take that
if you need to.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.567
So let's start where
we always do,

05:33.601 --> 05:35.636
reach out to the newest
victims on the site,

05:35.669 --> 05:36.837
see if any devices were hacked.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.541
TRACY: Sorry I called
in the middle of a work day.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.577
I didn't know
what else to do.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.145
First, all my utilities
were shut off.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.615
The service companies
blamed it on a computer error.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.384
Then my mail got put
on vacation hold.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.486
The post office said that
I filled out a form online--

05:52.520 --> 05:53.687
I didn't.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.689
And then, yesterday,

05:55.723 --> 05:58.058
I get called into HR.
At work.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.994
Due to the nature of the e-mails
you sent Mr. Williams...

06:01.028 --> 06:02.663
What e-mails?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.665
...we're going to have to ask
you to pack up your things,

06:04.698 --> 06:05.733
and leave the office
immediately.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.667
You're firing me?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.969
You're lucky I'm not
calling the cops, Tracy.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.139
He said that I sent him
an e-mail threatening

06:12.172 --> 06:13.741
to tell his wife
about our affair.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.008
There is no affair!

06:15.042 --> 06:16.610
I never sent
those e-mails, Raven,

06:16.644 --> 06:18.446
but-but because they're coming
from my account,

06:18.479 --> 06:19.613
nobody believes me!

06:19.647 --> 06:20.814
And then, two days ago,

06:20.848 --> 06:22.516
I get kicked out
of my apartment.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.617
I don't have anywhere to go!

06:23.651 --> 06:24.552
You can't just evict me!

06:24.585 --> 06:26.487
You're the one
who terminated your lease.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.488
I would've
appreciated a call,

06:27.521 --> 06:28.456
not just an e-mail,
you know.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.458
Finally, I went to the cops.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.726
All of these e-mails
came from your account.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.994
Yeah, but I didn't
write any of them.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.696
Well, do you know
who did?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.631
Isn't that your job
to figure out?

06:37.665 --> 06:38.932
Look, if there's no name,

06:38.966 --> 06:40.634
then there's really nothing
we can do for you.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.436
Someone's hacked
my computer,

06:42.470 --> 06:44.204
pretends to be me,

06:44.237 --> 06:45.939
and is literally
destroying my life.

06:45.973 --> 06:46.974
They have to be stopped.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.476
We have no leads on this.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.110
And even if you did know
who was doing this,

06:50.143 --> 06:52.145
in order to get a restraining
order against that person,

06:52.179 --> 06:54.482
they would need
to physically threaten you.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.984
So, whoever is doing this
has to try to kill me

06:57.017 --> 06:58.752
before you get off your ass!

06:58.786 --> 06:59.853
Look, Raven, I know

06:59.887 --> 07:02.790
that you work in I.T.
for the museums--

07:02.823 --> 07:04.925
is there anybody who could
maybe look at my computer?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.594
Or maybe you?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.095
I know you did
some hacking.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.196
Of course.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.798
Hey, I'll see
what I can do.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.600
And you can stay with me

07:12.633 --> 07:14.502
until you get your apartment
figured out.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.737
(phone chimes)

07:18.005 --> 07:19.239
Well, that may be awhile,

07:19.272 --> 07:21.141
because my bank account
is empty.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.846
MUNDO:
Just hear me out. I...

07:26.747 --> 07:28.448
You're being
unreasonable. I...

07:29.249 --> 07:30.884
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.687
I've reached out
to the, uh,

07:33.721 --> 07:34.788
to the new victims of
Rizzo's site...

07:34.822 --> 07:36.624
Elijah, there
comes a point

07:36.657 --> 07:38.892
where whatever's going on
in your personal life

07:38.926 --> 07:40.828
starts to reflect
on your work.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.831
You're saying it has?

07:43.864 --> 07:46.800
And there's a point where
I just care about you.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.669
I know you spent the last
few nights in the bar,

07:48.702 --> 07:50.137
instead of home
with your family.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.271
And you can't use that

07:51.304 --> 07:53.774
"I was working late"
excuse with me.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.943
Is everything okay
with you and Devon?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.177
Yes.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.846
Yeah, it's...

07:58.879 --> 08:00.614
What is it?

08:00.648 --> 08:01.782
(sighs)

08:05.152 --> 08:06.587
My dad has cancer.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.893
Oh, Elijah.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.629
What kind of cancer?

08:15.663 --> 08:16.764
Is there a prognosis?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.766
They found an
inoperable tumor

08:18.799 --> 08:20.300
in his spinal cord...

08:20.333 --> 08:22.169
He needs chemo and radiation,

08:22.202 --> 08:23.771
and he's refusing treatment.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.073
There's a possibility
he could be paralyzed or...

08:26.106 --> 08:27.941
you know... worse.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.177
You just need to focus
on your family right now.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.047
Take some time off;
do what you need to do.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.950
What I need to do is work.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.793
*

09:01.842 --> 09:03.777
There you are:
an unauthorized IP address.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.813
Gotcha.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.881
The hacker's name
is Kyle Bristow,

09:07.915 --> 09:10.317
and this morning he emptied
my friend Tracy's bank accounts

09:10.350 --> 09:11.952
from his home computer
in Maryland.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.286
Raven, I know
she's your friend,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.188
but one case of bank fraud
doesn't require

09:15.222 --> 09:16.890
the whole Cyber Division.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.826
He got her fired
from her job,

09:18.859 --> 09:19.827
and evicted from
her apartment.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.829
I think Tracy was the
target of the SWATing.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.997
I really believe that
Tracy's in danger.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.866
I'll tell you what:

09:25.899 --> 09:27.334
I'll send Elijah
to check out Kyle Bristow.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.837
Meanwhile, you and Krumitz
stay on this Rizzo case.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.305
Great.
Thank you, Avery.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.700
(door creaks open)

10:14.014 --> 10:15.182
(indistinct
radio communication)

10:17.250 --> 10:18.819
Victim's name
is Kyle Bristow.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.754
Medical examiner
determined his death

10:20.788 --> 10:22.389
sometime within
the last three hours.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.924
Blunt force trauma.

10:23.957 --> 10:24.892
Wife confirmed there's
a decorative obelisk

10:24.925 --> 10:26.326
missing from the mantel.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.295
RYAN: Whew! Overkill.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.730
This denotes
a crime of passion,

10:29.763 --> 10:30.798
driven by anger.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.901
Killer kept striking Kyle,
even after he was dead.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.902
This is personal.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.203
The wife's
alibi checks out.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.771
She was at work
during the TOD.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.140
We know she got here
just before you did.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.109
So what are you thinking,
should we just

10:42.142 --> 10:43.977
hand this case off
to Maryland PD?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.179
Raven has proof that
Kyle was a hacker.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.415
There's a cyber element
to this case that's ours.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.751
Did you find anything
in the vic's devices?

10:50.784 --> 10:51.852
Yeah.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.286
Got two cell phones
on the victim.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.023
One of them was a burner
with a lot of activity,

10:56.056 --> 10:58.158
including some
very angry text threats...

10:58.191 --> 10:59.960
from Raven's friend Tracy.

11:01.962 --> 11:02.796
Looks like they knew each other.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.166
Maybe Tracy wasn't
looking for justice.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.970
Maybe she was looking
for revenge.

11:28.088 --> 11:34.027
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

11:35.929 --> 11:42.302
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

11:42.335 --> 11:45.839
* I can see
for miles and miles *

11:45.873 --> 11:49.877
* I can see for miles
and miles *

11:49.910 --> 11:53.947
* I can see
for miles and miles *

11:53.981 --> 11:57.517
* And miles...

11:57.550 --> 11:58.752
* Oh, yeah.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.498
RAMIREZ:
Marcie, your photo is on a site

12:11.531 --> 12:13.166
called ShamedExxx.com.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.068
Yep. Okay.
I'm pretty sure
this is your photo.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.870
RAMIREZ: It's a site created
by a man named Garth Rizzo.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.371
KRUMITZ: Yeah, there's
a naked photo of you online.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.073
RAMIREZ: Now, would you be
willing to drive to D.C.?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.141
KRUMITZ:
No, this is not a prank.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.309
RAMIREZ:
Today would be great.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.244
Okay. Bye.
I'm an agent
at the FBI.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.814
Hello? Hello... Hmm.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.851
Heard from Tracy?
No.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.385
No, her phone is off.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.087
This is not like her.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.923
Something's wrong.
(elevator bell dings)

12:37.390 --> 12:39.192
Elijah?

12:40.593 --> 12:43.196
Did you talk to Kyle Bristow?

12:43.230 --> 12:44.497
What happened?

12:44.531 --> 12:46.900
Um... (sighs)

12:47.968 --> 12:50.270
Kyle Bristow was found murdered
in his house yesterday.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.805
What?

12:51.839 --> 12:54.374
Did you tell Tracy
you'd I.D.'d her hacker?

12:54.407 --> 12:55.475
No.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.977
No, I would never do that.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.847
You can't honestly think
Tracy was involved.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.815
She's the victim here.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.051
(sighs) It's tough
to look at it that way

13:04.084 --> 13:06.186
after you've met Kyle's widow
and two children.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.890
Raven, did you know
that Tracy has a record?

13:09.923 --> 13:10.991
She's been booked
on drunk and disorderly.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.059
She's been in rehab.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.560
And she's been clean
for months now.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.395
She's not a murderer.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.431
Everything I see
says differently.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.033
I'm sorry.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.414
*

13:49.930 --> 13:51.431
(engine starts)

14:08.115 --> 14:09.883
OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

14:09.917 --> 14:12.652
Um, hi. I have information
about a murder,

14:12.685 --> 14:14.587
and I think I know who did it.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.056
NELSON:
These are the phones recovered

14:16.089 --> 14:17.357
from the Kyle Bristow
murder scene.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.094
There's no communication
between Kyle and Tracy

14:21.128 --> 14:23.330
on this phone, but...
based on the messages

14:23.363 --> 14:25.265
I found on Kyle's
side-piece phone,

14:25.298 --> 14:26.533
ooh, Tracy had

14:26.566 --> 14:28.201
motive to kill.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.369
Side-piece phone?

14:29.402 --> 14:31.004
You're saying that Tracy
was his mistress?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.973
Yeah.
The two have been messaging

14:33.006 --> 14:35.308
each other on the HeartMate
dating app for the last month.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.177
RUSSELL: Kyle was
pretending to be single?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.611
I mean, he was in
full-on cheater mode.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.980
Made up a whole
nother life

14:40.013 --> 14:41.114
that didn't include
his wife and kids.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.383
She's been asking
to meet for weeks.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.385
He just kept
making excuses.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.553
So, a cheater
who wasn't really cheating.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.654
Yeah, but then
yesterday,

14:47.687 --> 14:49.957
Kyle sent her a message
saying that he wanted to meet.

14:49.990 --> 14:50.890
Sent her his address.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.459
That puts her
at the scene of the crime.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.560
Definitely
a bad move.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.128
The last message
Tracy sent

14:55.162 --> 14:56.163
accused him
of lying.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.897
Look, she found out
he was married.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.667
Motive.
A few days before,

15:00.700 --> 15:02.302
Kyle sent
Tracy a message

15:02.335 --> 15:04.437
saying he was starting
to fall in love with her.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.039
Even though they'd never met?

15:06.073 --> 15:07.574
Welcome to the world
of online dating.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.277
I mean, people chat for a
year, they fall in love,

15:10.310 --> 15:12.579
they get engaged--
without ever meeting each other.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.447
When I was your age,
you actually used to

15:14.481 --> 15:17.150
have to walk up
to a woman and say hello

15:17.184 --> 15:20.020
before you could declare
your undying love.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.288
NELSON: Yeah, well, apps
have changed everything.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.456
This is HeartMate.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.958
So, this app actually shows you

15:24.992 --> 15:27.227
how close you are
to another user?
Mm-hmm.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.396
And how many times
you guys have crossed paths.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.298
Like this girl here, right?

15:31.331 --> 15:33.233
We've walked past each other...

15:33.266 --> 15:35.435
82 times.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.437
Stalker numbers.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.007
No, no, that's Jennifer Wilkins.
She works here.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.608
Really?
Yeah.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.176
She's right behind you, man.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.744
No, no, don't, don't.
Oh.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.314
Don't, don't.
Right.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.182
Smooth.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.650
RUSSELL:
Come on.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.352
Give her a heart
after that. Come on.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.622
No. Nah, I'm not really
looking for anything.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.723
How about you?

15:56.756 --> 15:59.659
Any special lady
in your life?

15:59.692 --> 16:01.461
No, not since my divorce.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.663
I don't think this online
dating thing is for me.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.533
I'm more of a "wait for
serendipity to strike"

16:06.566 --> 16:07.734
kind of guy.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.302
Serendipity?

16:09.336 --> 16:11.004
Is that a new app?

16:12.039 --> 16:13.706
How old are you?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.708
DETECTIVE:
Miss Ramirez, last weekend,

16:15.742 --> 16:16.709
you were with
Tracy Jacobs

16:16.743 --> 16:18.711
the night that SWAT
came to your apartment.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.580
Is that correct?
Yes.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.582
Was anyone else at your
apartment that night?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.417
No.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.087
DETECTIVE:
This morning, we got an
anonymous tip that led us

16:27.120 --> 16:29.189
to the weapon that was used
to murder Kyle Bristow.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.058
It was found in
a hotel room

16:31.091 --> 16:32.725
we believe was occupied by
Tracy Jacobs last night.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.094
RYAN:
Detective Gonzalez,

16:34.127 --> 16:35.728
what does this
have to do with Raven?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.064
Well, the same person

16:37.097 --> 16:38.398
that called in
the anonymous tip

16:38.431 --> 16:39.732
also made the 911 call

16:39.766 --> 16:41.434
the night that
she was SWATed.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.702
Do you have any idea
who that might be?

16:42.735 --> 16:44.671
No.
But whoever it was

16:44.704 --> 16:46.506
framed Tracy
for Kyle Bristow's murder.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.475
That's the person
you should be looking for.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.476
Raven,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.078
as Cyber Division's
legal counsel,

16:51.111 --> 16:52.712
I'm advising you should
refrain from comment.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.147
Just answer the questions.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.083
I know this
is difficult for you

16:56.116 --> 16:58.118
because Tracy is your friend,
but you need to know

16:58.151 --> 17:01.088
she is the primary suspect
in this case.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.123
GONZALEZ:
Miss Ramirez,

17:03.156 --> 17:04.557
we know that you texted Tracy

17:04.591 --> 17:05.625
this message yesterday.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.561
"I know who
your hacker is.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.197
I'm taking
care of it."

17:10.230 --> 17:11.798
Raven, is this true?

17:11.831 --> 17:14.634
Yeah, but I...
I didn't give her a name.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.636
I didn't tell her
it was Kyle Bristow.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.339
We found Tracy's fingerprints
at the crime scene.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.375
On the door handle,
inside the home.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.411
They match the partials
that we lifted

17:24.444 --> 17:25.645
from her devices.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.414
GONZALEZ:
Tracy's been off
the grid ever since

17:27.447 --> 17:28.448
they found Kyle Bristow's body.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.549
Do you know where she is?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.351
No.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.821
Raven, would you mind
excusing us?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.128
GONZALEZ:
I was wondering why

17:41.161 --> 17:42.829
the Feds were so interested
in a homicide case.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.397
Now it's pretty clear.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.099
Protecting one
of your own.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.101
That's not
what's happening here.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.636
There's evidence of cyber fraud.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.338
That makes this our case.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.440
And I'd kindly
appreciate you sending

17:53.473 --> 17:56.176
any evidence you've collected
to our lab.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.878
Agent Ryan, Raven Ramirez
is a known associate

17:58.911 --> 18:00.313
of our primary suspect.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.748
She could be an
accessory to murder.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.850
This is a clear
conflict of interest.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.452
Raven is not working
on the Bristow case.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.653
There is no conflict
of interest.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.621
Thank you
for your time,

18:08.655 --> 18:10.423
Detective Gonzalez.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.162
Avery, next time you
call me down here,

18:15.195 --> 18:16.429
just tell me the truth.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.698
You needed me to witness
that conversation

18:18.731 --> 18:20.767
in case it comes back
to bite you in the ass.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.868
Which it might.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.136
Point taken, Mason.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.704
Just need a little legal support

18:24.737 --> 18:27.240
from the
Department of Justice.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.178
Are we in trouble here?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.180
Better make damn sure
whatever work you're doing

18:33.213 --> 18:35.348
on the Kyle Bristow
murder case is aboveboard.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.649
Is there anything else?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.285
Give me something
on Garth Rizzo.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.687
I want that case file
closed sooner than later.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.921
It's all about
setting precedent.

18:41.954 --> 18:42.922
If we get Rizzo,

18:42.955 --> 18:45.592
I can advocate
for stronger revenge porn laws.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.162
Take down all the
Rizzo copycats with him.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.230
We're working on it.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.898
Okay.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.866
Got a lot going on here.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.335
(chuckles)

18:55.368 --> 18:59.172
Women have an uncanny ability
to multitask.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.474
You should try it sometime.
(laughs)

19:01.508 --> 19:02.942
NELSON:
These points represent

19:02.975 --> 19:04.744
the frequent locations
of Kyle Bristow's

19:04.777 --> 19:06.179
two phones during
the last month.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.447
The one in blue
his regular phone;

19:07.480 --> 19:09.382
the one in red
his side-piece phone.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.717
Check this out.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.485
(typing)

19:12.519 --> 19:14.387
RUSSELL:
They only share one data point.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.889
So the only time those two
phones were in the same place

19:16.923 --> 19:19.392
was at Kyle's house
during the murder, right?

19:19.426 --> 19:20.927
Exactly, so in all other cases,
they were miles apart.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.196
So, how can one man
be in two

19:23.230 --> 19:24.497
different places
at the same time?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.366
He can't. Pull up the
texts from both phones.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.567
(typing)

19:27.600 --> 19:30.337
All right,
the side-piece phone--

19:30.370 --> 19:31.504
there's lower-case letters,

19:31.538 --> 19:32.905
there are abbreviations,

19:32.939 --> 19:34.841
emoticons, no punctuation.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.244
On his regular phone--
complete sentences,

19:37.277 --> 19:39.279
capital letters, no shorthand.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.580
Proves that two different people
wrote the messages.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.981
RYAN: Well, it
implies that.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.283
We have to prove it.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.785
Oh. Microbials.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.591
RAMIREZ: This was posted
on Garth Rizzo's site.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.263
I took that photo
years ago.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.865
I was in a long-distance
relationship.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.401
It was supposed to be
for his eyes only.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.870
And now it's on the Internet?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.705
God, I'm so embarrassed.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.241
You think my ex
did this to me?

20:08.275 --> 20:09.476
It's possible, Marcie.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.611
You also could have been
hacked by a stranger.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.980
We've already started
analyzing your devices,

20:14.013 --> 20:15.282
and hopefully
we'll find proof.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.019
Every person has
a unique set of germs

20:20.052 --> 20:21.488
that only link back to them.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.989
They're called microbials.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.492
'Cause of our excessive use
of our devices,

20:25.525 --> 20:27.360
they're like extensions
of our own flesh.

20:27.394 --> 20:31.264
Our microbials can actually
transfer to our devices.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.833
So I analyzed both
of Kyle Bristow's phones.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.006
RUSSELL:
On the screen here, you can see

20:40.039 --> 20:41.641
the microbials
from his everyday phone.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.611
And on the right...
from his side-piece phone.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.812
NELSON:
They look completely different.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.046
RUSSELL:
That's because they are.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.349
Microbials are
a new identifier--

20:49.382 --> 20:50.583
as unique as fingerprints.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.453
So, if the microbials don't
match on each of these phones,

20:53.486 --> 20:54.721
you're saying that Kyle didn't
use both these devices.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.855
Exactly.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.790
I can tell you with...
with scientific certainty

20:57.824 --> 21:00.693
these phones belonged
to two different people.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.295
And this side-piece phone
was not Kyle's.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.763
The microbials on it

21:03.796 --> 21:06.533
did not match a sample
that was taken from his body.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.801
That side-piece phone
was staged.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.503
Okay, so if the phone
wasn't Kyle's,

21:10.537 --> 21:12.572
then he wasn't the one talking
to Tracy on HeartMate.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.574
Whoever the real owner
of this phone was,

21:14.607 --> 21:16.676
they used Kyle's photo
to pretend to be him.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.311
That means all the data
we pulled

21:18.345 --> 21:20.580
from the side-piece phone
was all cyber-staged.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.549
Someone wanted us
to believe that Kyle

21:22.582 --> 21:25.352
was having an online
relationship with Tracy.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.399
(phone ringing)

21:40.633 --> 21:41.768
Hello.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.336
Mrs. Jacobs,
this is Detective Murphy.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.971
I have some questions
about your daughter.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.340
Yes. Are you with
Detective Gonzalez?

21:47.374 --> 21:49.041
Uh, yes.
That's my partner.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.677
I just have some
follow-up questions.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.745
I was just about to call you.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.714
Uh, Tracy just contacted me.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.115
She did?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.385
Did she say where she was?

21:58.418 --> 22:00.620
No, but I'm worried.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.755
Do you have any idea
where she might be going?

22:02.789 --> 22:04.757
She wanted me
to wire her some money.

22:04.791 --> 22:08.461
I-I know I shouldn't have,
but she sounded scared.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.730
Mrs. Jacobs, you have to tell me
where you sent that money.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.998
I need to bring Tracy in

22:12.031 --> 22:13.032
before she hurts herself
or others.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.046
We thought the side-piece phone
belonged to Kyle.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.715
Now that we know
a third party was using it,

22:28.748 --> 22:30.483
let's use the
HeartMate app

22:30.517 --> 22:33.486
to track our target's
pattern of life.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.621
NELSON:
All right,

22:34.654 --> 22:36.489
since HeartMate is always
recording your movements,

22:36.523 --> 22:38.157
I have the data from all the
people he's crossed paths with

22:38.190 --> 22:40.159
since he started
the fake Kyle profile.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.595
And the red dots are the times
he crossed paths with Tracy--

22:42.629 --> 22:43.596
154.

22:43.630 --> 22:44.597
Clearly he was
stalking her.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.999
Nelson, eliminate
all the Tracy data points

22:47.033 --> 22:47.967
when he was actively
stalking her.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.836
Should give us a smaller
vicinity to search.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.505
All right, that leaves
us with all the locations

22:52.539 --> 22:53.673
that relate just
to our target.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.509
Every one of these places
should help us build a profile.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.845
Triangulate the data,
narrow his domain--

22:58.878 --> 23:00.847
where he lives,
works and plays.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.148
Might help us
I.D. our target.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.984
Let's see if Kyle's fake profile

23:05.017 --> 23:07.854
gives us any clues to our
target's real identity.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.023
He carefully constructed
his fake dating profile.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.291
He chose a good school
but not Ivy League.

23:12.324 --> 23:16.929
An architect is a profession,
well-respected but attainable.

23:16.963 --> 23:19.098
He chose Kyle's photo,
a handsome man

23:19.131 --> 23:20.633
because our target has
low self-esteem

23:20.667 --> 23:21.768
about his own appearance.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.836
So it's wish
fulfillment.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.505
He's projecting
an idealized self,

23:25.538 --> 23:27.640
pretending to be
who he wishes he could be.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.842
Take a look
at this.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.544
Looks like somebody used
Kyle's network to make it look

23:31.578 --> 23:32.679
like he was the
one hacking Tracy.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.213
Kyle's devices are clean.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.617
But we did locate the device
he used to hack Tracy's e-mail.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.885
It's a computer
at a frame store.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.689
NELSON:
This was the computer

23:42.722 --> 23:43.690
that logged into Tracy's
e-mail account.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.759
Side-piece phone also
recorded the same location

23:46.793 --> 23:47.727
over 80 times.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.462
Now, either he really
likes picture frames...

23:49.496 --> 23:50.663
Or he works here.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.698
It's an employee-only
computer.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.505
Kyle Bristow was a customer.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.607
Wait a minute, that's
the same photo he used

24:00.640 --> 24:02.709
on Kyle's fake HeartMate
dating profile.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.677
Pull up the invoice.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.884
Kyle Bristow dropped off
that picture a month ago.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.721
MAN: Here you go,
Mr. Bristow.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.888
Thank you.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.239
How's that Rizzo case going?
Not great.

24:33.272 --> 24:36.008
No intrusion on
Marcie's devices.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.678
And since the district doesn't
have any revenge porn laws,

24:38.711 --> 24:41.648
once a woman sends her photo
to her boyfriend or anyone,

24:41.681 --> 24:43.249
he could do whatever
he wanted with it,

24:43.282 --> 24:45.652
and there's nothing we
could do to help her.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.754
Which seems like
the theme of my day.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.622
Tracy's not your
responsibility, Raven.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.758
I know.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.093
Maybe if I had told her
I worked for the FBI,

24:54.126 --> 24:55.261
she wouldn't have run.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.764
Maybe she would have run
no matter what.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.634
What if I'm wrong
about Tracy, Nelson?

25:01.668 --> 25:04.270
What if she's guilty?

25:04.303 --> 25:05.538
It has to be here.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.472
Can-can you please
check again?

25:06.505 --> 25:07.974
My mother said she was
wiring money here.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.008
Sure.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.779
I'm sorry, miss,
the transaction was canceled.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.246
Um...

25:16.215 --> 25:18.184
Okay, h-how much does
a SIM card cost?

25:18.217 --> 25:20.853
Ten.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.789
Fine.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.791
Thanks.
Thank you.

25:44.811 --> 25:45.812
(gasps)

25:49.148 --> 25:51.350
Sorry to startle you,

25:51.383 --> 25:53.019
but, uh, you have
a flat tire.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.687
Ugh, damn it.

25:54.721 --> 25:55.855
I don't have a spare.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.724
You could call a tow truck.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.592
It'll take a hour and
cost you about 40 bucks.

26:01.694 --> 26:04.897
Or I could give you
a ride somewhere.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.799
I mean, if-if you want.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.271
It's just a couple miles
till the bus station.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.840
You know, you
look familiar.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.044
Oh, I-I think I just have
one of those faces.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.880
No, I-I think
I've met you before.

26:20.913 --> 26:25.151
I remember now-- I offered to
buy you a drink at the Corridor.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.819
Oh.

26:26.853 --> 26:29.155
Oh, right, yeah.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.790
Yeah, small world.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.894
Hey, I just got a hit
on Tracy's cell phone.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.698
Look, she's traveling south
on Route 15 in Virginia.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.032
She must have changed
her phone number

26:40.066 --> 26:41.367
because it's still off-line.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.269
But her HeartMate
app is running.

26:43.302 --> 26:44.937
'Cause even if you change
your SIM card,

26:44.971 --> 26:46.806
some apps like HeartMate
stay logged in.

26:46.839 --> 26:47.940
We can find
her new number.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.041
Who are you calling?

26:49.075 --> 26:50.142
I'm calling Elijah.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.746
Raven, I'm sorry,
I have to do this.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.147
Local PD needs
to pick her up.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.183
I know.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.755
Um, I think it's
the next street here.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.893
Oh, you passed it.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.995
So how's your boyfriend?

27:09.028 --> 27:11.397
He's good.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.734
Must be nice to have
someone you can count on,

27:14.767 --> 27:17.403
someone who won't ever
lie to you.

27:17.436 --> 27:18.537
Yeah, it's great.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.873
Um, you know, you can actually
just let me off here.

27:20.907 --> 27:21.808
(sirens blare)
I'll walk.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.852
Tracy Jacobs,
you're under arrest

27:32.885 --> 27:34.353
for the murder of Kyle Bristow.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.889
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

27:36.923 --> 27:38.057
in a court of law.

27:40.927 --> 27:43.362
Uh, Officer, I had no idea
she was a fugitive.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.031
I just offered
to give her a ride.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.899
She had a flat tire.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.368
Geez, she seemed so nice.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.210
I didn't kill Kyle Bristow.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.746
Then why did you run?

27:59.779 --> 28:01.113
I-I was in rehab.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.783
I have a record-- I'm guilty
until proven innocent.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.452
What happened when you went
to Kyle's house this morning?

28:06.485 --> 28:10.022
The door was wide open,
so I-I just went inside.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.457
Was Kyle there?

28:11.490 --> 28:13.960
I don't know.

28:13.993 --> 28:17.864
I keep seeing images
of his body on the ground.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.000
There was so much blood.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.838
I don't remember what happened.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.107
I really liked
the guy.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.475
Why would I hurt him?

28:31.778 --> 28:33.746
Do you remember
sending these messages

28:33.780 --> 28:35.247
to Kyle on HeartMate
yesterday?

28:36.883 --> 28:37.984
Uh-uh.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.351
No, I didn't send these.

28:40.953 --> 28:41.954
Wait, Kyle's married?

28:41.988 --> 28:43.289
Yes.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.825
You weren't communicating
with Kyle on HeartMate.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.960
But it was his picture;
he was texting me.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.396
That was someone
pretending to be Kyle.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.300
These are the men
that had access

28:54.333 --> 28:56.302
to the computer
that hacked you.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.004
Do you recognize
any of them?

28:59.238 --> 29:01.774
Him, I think
his name is Holden?

29:02.909 --> 29:05.945
I had a flat tire, and he
offered to give me a ride.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.948
Tracy, did you have any other
encounters with Holden?

29:08.981 --> 29:10.817
He said I met him
in a bar.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.919
I guess I blew him off.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.787
I believe that
Holden was pretending

29:14.821 --> 29:15.988
to be Kyle on HeartMate.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.157
Meeting you in that bar
was no accident.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.393
He spent weeks as Kyle,
getting to know you,

29:21.427 --> 29:23.930
so that he could approach you
in the real world--

29:23.963 --> 29:26.933
your preferences,
what you liked and disliked,

29:26.966 --> 29:28.434
what made you laugh and smile.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.437
He knew I was in AA.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.973
Because I told Kyle.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.808
I told him everything.

29:35.842 --> 29:38.811
Holden is his very own
Cyrano de Bergerac.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.947
When you rejected him
in that bar,

29:40.980 --> 29:42.949
he felt all of his work
had been for nothing,

29:42.982 --> 29:46.518
and he decided
he was gonna get revenge.

29:48.354 --> 29:49.989
(door opens)

29:50.022 --> 29:53.459
Tracy Jacobs is not guilty
of Kyle Bristow's murder.

29:53.492 --> 29:56.128
I need you to convince
the state prosecutor

29:56.162 --> 29:58.965
to hold of for 72 hours
before prosecuting.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.000
Let me give you some
legal counsel instead.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.201
Walk away.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.003
This is not a hill
you want to die on.

30:04.036 --> 30:04.871
I can't walk away.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.538
Mason, this young
woman is innocent.

30:06.572 --> 30:09.008
Holden Katnik
is framing her.

30:09.041 --> 30:12.544
The prosecutor has prints on
a murder weapon, and she fled.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.981
Where's your evidence?
It's clear what happened here.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.483
Holden murdered Kyle.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.485
Then he sent Tracy messages
on HeartMate

30:19.518 --> 30:22.021
luring her to Kyle's house

30:22.054 --> 30:23.990
and planted a burner cell
at the scene.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.060
When Tracy arrived,
Holden drugged her.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.332
He took the murder weapon
from the scene,

30:33.365 --> 30:35.067
drove Tracy to a motel

30:35.101 --> 30:38.570
and then planted the murder
weapon in her motel room.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.910
He's responsible for the angry
messages on Tracy's phone.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.513
It's all a setup
to fabricate motive.

30:47.546 --> 30:50.049
That story might
impress a jury,

30:50.082 --> 30:52.351
but Tracy's testimony
won't even back it up.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.020
She has no memory
of those events.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.354
I mean, if you want
to exonerate her,

30:55.387 --> 30:56.989
you need more
than conjecture.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.992
You need to prove that
this Holden Katnik did it.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.266
Nelson, Krumitz.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.936
I need to know where we stand
on the Bristow case.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.104
Do we have anything to prove
that Tracy's innocent?
KRUMITZ: No.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.973
I looked at Tracy's
frequent locations.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.075
She was at Kyle Bristow's
house from 12:32

31:16.108 --> 31:17.944
until 12:42 p.m.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.412
And time of death window is
from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.015
So that does not clear Tracy.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.683
KRUMITZ: If we had the exact
time of death, we could prove

31:24.716 --> 31:26.018
Tracy wasn't even there
when Kyle was murdered.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.686
Enzymes.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.956
Oh.
(laughs)

31:29.989 --> 31:32.091
Are we supposed
to follow people

31:32.124 --> 31:34.193
when they say weird words
and run out of the room?

31:56.582 --> 31:58.217
So if this works,

31:58.250 --> 32:01.087
we should get Kyle Bristow's
exact time of death?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.089
In theory, this
process will show us

32:03.122 --> 32:06.058
the degradation of the
proteins in Kyle's muscles,

32:06.092 --> 32:08.727
which will narrow down the time
of death to within minutes.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.729
Did you just use
the word "theory"?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.198
How experimental is this?

32:12.231 --> 32:14.166
Don't worry, this
has been lab tested.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.136
On pigs.

32:17.169 --> 32:20.406
No, hey, p-pigs are
the closest thing we got.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.075
Don't tell me any more--
plausible deniability.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.943
(chuckles)

32:28.247 --> 32:30.716
RUSSELL:
Time of death, 11:58 a.m.

32:30.749 --> 32:31.650
Yeah.
(laughs)

32:31.683 --> 32:35.321
Tracy Jacobs did not kill
Kyle Bristow.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.488
I think the word "bingo"
(whoops)

32:36.522 --> 32:37.556
is in order here.

32:37.589 --> 32:38.624
Hello.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.492
Oh, yeah, wait a minute.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.036
RAMIREZ:
Tracy.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.503
Hey.
Raven?

32:51.537 --> 32:56.042
I don't work for the museums,
I work for the FBI,

32:56.075 --> 32:59.445
and you're the first person in
my life who knows the truth.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.413
I'm so sorry I
didn't tell you.

33:02.781 --> 33:05.717
Yeah, no, I-I get it.

33:07.286 --> 33:08.487
Okay, here's your new
phone and laptop,

33:08.520 --> 33:10.522
completely hack-proof.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.524
Even I couldn't break the
encryption on these devices.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.060
So Holden won't
be able to find me?

33:14.093 --> 33:16.062
The head of the NSA won't
be able to find you.

33:16.095 --> 33:19.065
It's like putting your devices
in witness protection.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.067
And until we capture Holden,

33:21.100 --> 33:23.369
we've got you in a hotel
room all set up for you.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.737
I'm so sorry this happened.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.042
I'm so glad
you're okay.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.446
MICHELLE:
Daddy?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.382
Yeah.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.550
Why didn't Grandpa
pick me up from school?

33:38.584 --> 33:39.785
Is he okay?

33:39.818 --> 33:41.787
He-he just fell asleep.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.256
That's all.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.225
We always get
ice cream on Fridays.

33:46.258 --> 33:49.095
Can we go?

33:49.128 --> 33:51.130
I'll get some
for Grandpa too.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.448
It's gonna
be okay, Daddy.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.250
It'll be all right.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.193
Cutting-edge forensics, really?

34:21.227 --> 34:23.229
The pseudoscience
used to determine

34:23.262 --> 34:27.366
the "exact" time of Kyle's
death isn't even validated yet,

34:27.399 --> 34:29.568
hasn't even been
tested on humans yet.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.371
It may not be established
method yet, but it will be.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.241
There is real science
to back it up.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.208
(scoffs)

34:36.242 --> 34:38.677
You know I do things
in an unconventional way.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.346
Unconventional is one thing.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.514
Irresponsible is another.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.250
This will never hold
up in a court of law.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.585
And now I've got the state
prosecutor on the phone,

34:46.618 --> 34:48.320
asking me questions.

34:48.354 --> 34:50.189
We are very close
to a lead on Holden.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.491
"Very close."

34:52.524 --> 34:54.693
"Close" isn't good enough.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.263
Hey, I want Tracy Jacobs
back in custody now.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.710
(cell phone chimes)

35:37.969 --> 35:41.340
(cell phone rings)

35:41.373 --> 35:42.574
Hey.

35:42.608 --> 35:43.809
Raven, you promised that Holden
wouldn't be able to find me.

35:43.842 --> 35:44.843
He can't.

35:44.876 --> 35:45.844
He just texted me.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.213
He's watching me right now.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.680
That's impossible.

35:48.714 --> 35:51.250
Nobody can help me.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.652
Not even the FBI.

35:53.685 --> 35:54.786
Okay, hold on,
calm down.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.921
J... Tracy?

35:55.954 --> 35:57.456
Hello, Tracy?
What's wrong?

35:57.489 --> 35:59.791
Holden got ahold of Tracy.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.727
But I gave her a
phone that I configured

36:01.760 --> 36:03.562
with anonymized search
and disabled access

36:03.595 --> 36:04.796
to non-trusted hotspots.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.332
It's impossible.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.666
It was you.

36:07.699 --> 36:08.967
What?
You're the connection.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.469
He was in Tracy's e-mails.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.803
That's how he knew
you were friends.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.672
So he used me to get
to Tracy, but how?

36:13.705 --> 36:14.806
You have HeartMate, don't you?

36:14.840 --> 36:15.874
Oh, my gosh.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.710
Holden saw us together
the night of the SWATing.

36:18.744 --> 36:19.878
He's been following me.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.813
Explains how he got
Tracy's new number.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.482
You were with her
in this building an hour ago.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.716
He tracked you in here,

36:24.750 --> 36:26.218
and then he followed
Tracy when she left.

36:26.252 --> 36:28.387
She has an
encrypted device.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.689
Maybe he used a cell catcher
to get her new number.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.558
He just had to be
in close proximity.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.593
The cell catcher measures
signal strength,

36:34.626 --> 36:35.727
so he would know
which number was Tracy's

36:35.761 --> 36:37.296
based on his distance from her.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.767
Pull up your
HeartMate account.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.870
Cross-reference all the guys

36:44.903 --> 36:46.071
the HeartMate account
connected to an hour ago

36:46.104 --> 36:48.540
with all guys you connected to
the night you were SWATed.

36:48.574 --> 36:51.877
It'll be a fake profile
created by Holden Katnik.

36:51.910 --> 36:55.981
RAMIREZ: Looks like there's
only one name in common, Brad.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.916
Let me see if I can get
his account details.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.721
Brad Larson.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.892
Shoot. Straight to voice mail.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.663
Tracy, Holden's pretending
to be Brad Larson on HeartMate.

37:11.697 --> 37:12.864
He found you by following me.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.867
If anyone by that name tries
to contact you, ignore him.

37:15.901 --> 37:16.868
Let me know you got this.

37:16.902 --> 37:17.903
Just stay in your hotel room.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.910
*

37:56.408 --> 37:58.344
Okay, I'm tracking
Brad Larson.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.811
It's Holden's new
HeartMate identity.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.480
MUNDO: I need a team
in Adams Morgan

38:01.513 --> 38:02.814
at Fifth and Emerson,
male suspect,

38:02.848 --> 38:03.949
possible murder suspect.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.984
Raven, where's Tracy?
At the hotel.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.353
We just got a call.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.520
She never made it to
her room. Find her.

38:08.554 --> 38:09.555
Elijah, I'm with you.

38:11.690 --> 38:12.891
RAMIREZ:
Amy Whittaker.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.462
Tracy created a fake profile.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.063
What are you doing?

38:20.098 --> 38:22.568
(siren blares)

38:28.774 --> 38:30.409
Holden's on the north
side of the street.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.743
He's on the move.

38:31.777 --> 38:32.878
I don't have a visual.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.514
He's not in a car,
definitely on foot.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.748
Let's go.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.984
*

39:08.647 --> 39:11.016
RAMIREZ:
Tracy.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.386
Raven, let me go,
I have to do this.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.854
You're gonna give him
what he wants?

39:15.887 --> 39:17.556
Turn you into a killer?

39:17.589 --> 39:20.892
What else am I
supposed to do?

39:20.926 --> 39:22.794
He's never gonna stop.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.796
Yeah, he is.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.197
Right now.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.933
MUNDO: Holden Katnik, FBI,
put your hands in the air.
MAN: FBI, freeze.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.100
Hands in the air now.
Do not move.

39:29.134 --> 39:31.102
Slowly get down
on one knee.

39:31.136 --> 39:34.873
Holden Katnik, you're under
arrest for computer fraud

39:34.906 --> 39:36.708
and the murder
of Kyle Bristow.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.913
Come on.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.625
How did you find me?

39:53.659 --> 39:56.995
Fake name on HeartMate,
Amy Whittaker,

39:57.028 --> 39:59.831
that's your alter ego
when you go on benders.

39:59.865 --> 40:02.634
Are you gonna turn me in?

40:02.668 --> 40:04.069
RYAN:
Are you both okay?

40:06.505 --> 40:07.973
RYAN: Let's get
Tracy home.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.746
You saw the whole
thing, didn't you?

40:14.780 --> 40:18.083
Hey, you handled
it beautifully.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.918
How did you know
I was here?

40:19.951 --> 40:22.521
RYAN: I paired with one
of D.B.'s pacifiers.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.523
(chuckles)

40:24.556 --> 40:26.024
(chuckles)

40:27.058 --> 40:28.927
(elevator dings)

40:30.962 --> 40:33.699
Uh, thank you for letting me
get Michelle today.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.601
Family comes first.

40:38.069 --> 40:40.706
Yeah, I-I... thought
I had it all under control.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.073
I, um...

40:44.142 --> 40:46.011
I don't.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.146
Elijah...

40:48.179 --> 40:50.982
I'm here for you.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.684
We all are.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.022
Next time you talk
to your father,

40:57.055 --> 40:59.758
just tell him how
much he means to you.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.927
(elevator dings)

41:12.638 --> 41:14.606
RYAN: Oh, the guy
with the bright ideas.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.142
Oh, come on, now, you're not
beating yourself up, are you?

41:17.175 --> 41:19.077
'Cause that whole muscle
degradation technique,

41:19.110 --> 41:21.112
that was a
cutting-edge choice.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.981
More like "double-edged."
(chuckles)

41:23.014 --> 41:24.282
I could have gotten
myself fired.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.284
Eh, if you're not
almost getting fired,

41:26.317 --> 41:27.653
you're not doing your job.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.120
Well, my job is far from over.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.989
I mean, Holden might
be behind bars,

41:31.022 --> 41:33.859
but Garth Rizzo is
still out there,

41:33.892 --> 41:34.993
ruining women's lives.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.261
We'll get him.

41:36.294 --> 41:37.963
Have patience, my friend.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.632
It's only a
matter of time.

41:40.666 --> 41:41.967
(cell phone chimes)
Oh.

41:42.000 --> 41:42.968
Let me show you this.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.002
It's so bizarre.

41:44.035 --> 41:47.138
I keep getting these-these
push notifications.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.274
Oh, let me see.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.308
Ah.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.177
These are from SoulmateStop.com.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.645
Mmm.
Whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.781
I did not create a profile.

41:55.814 --> 41:58.249
I sort of... did.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.018
(gasps)
Yeah, it was a... What?

42:00.051 --> 42:02.253
It was a free
trial period.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.322
RUSSELL: Where'd you get
this photo? It's horrible.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.991
Oh, it's your FBI
I.D. photo.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.726
You know I got to tell you,
I'm not... I'm not...

42:07.759 --> 42:10.095
I don't know how I feel
about this to be honest.

42:10.128 --> 42:10.896
Don't worry, okay?

42:10.929 --> 42:12.230
Look, I chose a
dating Web site

42:12.263 --> 42:13.732
that doesn't geolocate
like HeartMate.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.767
Now, whoa, whoa, whoa,
who's "Dolla Bill"?

42:15.801 --> 42:17.335
Stands for D.B.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.270
BOTH:
Dolla, dolla bill, y'all.

42:19.304 --> 42:22.140
"Marital status:
currently looking."

42:22.173 --> 42:25.977
Whoa, hey, Nelson, I'm divorced,
and I got four kids, all right?

42:26.011 --> 42:27.646
"Incredibly virile."
Yeah.

42:27.679 --> 42:28.747
NELSON:
I like that one.
Just man to man?

42:28.780 --> 42:31.216
"Hair color:
silver fox."

42:31.249 --> 42:33.351
I-I am not comfortable
with these answers, please.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.353
Online profile, that's
the first impression.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.888
That's the best version
of yourself.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.356
The... the better version.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.891
Yeah.
(scoffs)

42:39.925 --> 42:42.227
You have over
50 messages.
