WEBVTT

00:04.560 --> 00:07.400
You get knocked down.
You get back in the ring.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.680
I'm not upset about Alex.
I'm just not.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.920
Work. That's all I need.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.820
Oh, the prodigal daughter
has returned.

00:57.820 --> 00:59.340
What do you want?
A job.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.380
You think you can just waltz back
in?

01:03.380 --> 01:05.420
I'm not a life-support machine.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.380
I need a job, Stephanie, not oxygen.

01:07.380 --> 01:10.060
If you want something,
you have to be sweet.

01:10.060 --> 01:12.300
Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

01:12.300 --> 01:14.260
Thanks.

01:15.420 --> 01:17.100
I heard you'd been off the circuit.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.060
You were misinformed.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.060
You fell for someone.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.140
What?!

01:23.140 --> 01:25.060
I thought nothing could shock me.

01:25.060 --> 01:26.900
I hope he was worth it.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.180
Can't have been loaded,
or you wouldn't be here.

01:29.180 --> 01:31.420
Real romantic, aren't you?

01:31.420 --> 01:34.060
Belle! I thought you said you'd
never work for St...

01:35.980 --> 01:39.060
There's a party tonight.
Diplomats. In the country.

01:39.060 --> 01:41.540
They always come to me.
They want high-class girls.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.340
It's all very hush-hush.

01:43.340 --> 01:44.700
OK. Count me in.

01:44.700 --> 01:45.940
Can I go too?

01:45.940 --> 01:48.020
Did you not hear the words "high
class"?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.180
Aw, come on.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.780
Let her come. I'll take care of her.

01:52.900 --> 01:56.220
Oh, bugger it. Take her.
Money's money.

01:56.220 --> 01:58.260
Thanks.

01:58.260 --> 02:00.300
Do you know what love is, Belle?

02:00.300 --> 02:02.340
A marketing ploy.

02:02.340 --> 02:04.420
Remember that.

02:13.140 --> 02:14.900
So what's happening with you and
Alex?

02:14.900 --> 02:17.340
Oh, nothing. It's all past tense.
Oh, sorry.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.860
Oh bloody hell, Belle. Look at that.

02:21.900 --> 02:23.500
You might meet someone tonight.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.740
Oh, that's a pretty safe bet.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.980
Ladies...

02:55.420 --> 02:57.220
This is amazing.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.420
Quick. Take my picture.

02:59.420 --> 03:01.580
All right...

03:01.580 --> 03:03.620
Let me see. That's good.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.420
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:05.420 --> 03:07.620
if you would all get together,
please...

03:08.580 --> 03:10.340
Could we all gather together,
please?

03:11.860 --> 03:14.780
People keep telling me that life is
not a fairy tale.

03:14.780 --> 03:17.500
I aim to prove them wrong.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.780
Welcome.

03:20.780 --> 03:25.580
This evening, we are all in one such
fairy tale.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.700
Some cards
will be handed out to you.

03:28.700 --> 03:33.060
They will tell you which character
you are tonight.

03:33.060 --> 03:37.180
The aim is to find your perfect
partner...

03:37.180 --> 03:39.460
or partners!

03:39.460 --> 03:40.540
To create...

03:40.540 --> 03:42.980
Sex parties
are pretty straightforward.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.940
You replace a bowl of crisps with a
bowl of condoms,

03:45.940 --> 03:47.820
find your target,

03:47.820 --> 03:50.500
preferably the most attractive man in
the room.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.500
Small talk, cash, cab home. Done.

03:53.420 --> 03:54.500
But this...

03:57.100 --> 03:59.140
This is a bit different.

03:59.140 --> 04:01.100
Thank you.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.500
It's not like you to drink so much.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.740
Well, I don't really feel like me
tonight.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.700
So what happens next?

04:12.860 --> 04:14.140
This is the delicate bit.

04:14.140 --> 04:16.779
The transition from small talk to,
like, full-on fucking.

04:16.779 --> 04:18.019
Shall I just wait, then?

04:18.019 --> 04:20.300
No. You just approach whoever you
like the look of.

04:20.300 --> 04:23.420
OK. So who are you supposed to be?

04:24.500 --> 04:25.660
Rapunzel.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.380
Obviously.

04:27.380 --> 04:30.580
I need to find a man who can climb
walls

04:30.580 --> 04:32.660
and my hair.

04:32.660 --> 04:36.380
So glad I'm not Snow White. Fucked
if I'm doing it with seven dwarfs!

04:36.380 --> 04:37.900
My name is Bond.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.500
James Bond.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.420
Yuri, you were supposed to come as a
character from a bloody fairy tale.

04:44.420 --> 04:47.860
James. Didn't he like Pussy Galore?

04:47.860 --> 04:48.940
Ooh!

04:48.940 --> 04:53.500
Come with me, 007. I'm going to tell
you all my secrets.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.900
Didn't Pinocchio turn into a donkey?

04:56.900 --> 04:58.460
Yes.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.060
Donkey.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.780
Quite.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.380
So.

05:07.380 --> 05:08.460
How about it?

05:11.540 --> 05:13.500
Maybe later.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.220
Ah.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.500
You're my first Russian.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.460
Not Russian. Angliski.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.140
Bond. James Bond.

05:31.420 --> 05:33.900
Little Red Riding Hood -
if you have to shoot the wolf...

05:37.140 --> 05:39.020
Careful, careful.

05:39.020 --> 05:40.860
Shit. Is it real?

05:40.860 --> 05:42.020
Of course.

05:42.020 --> 05:46.140
So if the big bad wolf comes with
the big bad teeth,...

05:57.140 --> 05:59.660
Let me just put this over here.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.700
# THE SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE

06:01.700 --> 06:05.500
# In the sunshine of your love

06:05.500 --> 06:08.660
# Love love

06:09.860 --> 06:11.820
# Oh baby

06:13.500 --> 06:16.500
# Sunshine sunshine of your love

06:17.860 --> 06:20.500
# Oh, oh, oh, baby

06:23.300 --> 06:25.260
# I'm with you my love

06:27.540 --> 06:29.140
# The light's shining through

06:29.140 --> 06:30.500
# On you

06:30.500 --> 06:32.580
# I'm with you my love #

06:34.780 --> 06:36.460
You lost your Cinderella.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.780
Did you manage to grab her shoe
before she left?

06:38.780 --> 06:41.500
Shit.
I knew there was something.

06:44.620 --> 06:45.820
Do you like it?

06:45.820 --> 06:47.060
Watching?

06:47.060 --> 06:49.260
Sometimes. You?

06:49.260 --> 06:52.180
I'd like watching with you, yeah.

06:52.180 --> 06:55.740
Let's spend the night together.

06:55.740 --> 06:58.260
The whole night? There are so many
women here.

06:58.260 --> 07:01.780
Not interested.
I just want you.

07:03.180 --> 07:05.020
Why?

07:05.020 --> 07:07.460
Give me one good reason why not.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.260
Rapunzel.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.580
Rapunzel.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.460
Let down your hair.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.420
Come and be in my story.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.700
Imagine how hard the prince wanted
to fuck Rapunzel...

07:47.740 --> 07:49.700
..after he'd waited so long for her.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.700
Talk to me.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.100
Tell me what you like.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.420
I want you to do what I say.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.060
OK.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.100
You'll be a good girl?
Yes.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.740
Promise?
Promise.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.580
Close your eyes.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.860
Is that nice?

08:39.860 --> 08:40.820
Yes.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.260
What are you doing?

08:51.260 --> 08:53.300
Shh.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.340
It's OK. Close your eyes.

08:55.340 --> 08:57.300
Close your eyes.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.580
You're tied up. In the tower.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.620
And I am going to rescue you.

09:04.620 --> 09:08.100
I don't really want to be tied up.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.340
Shh. Don't spoil it.

09:11.340 --> 09:14.300
It's only a fantasy.
Don't make it real.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.780
I really don't want to be tied.

09:15.780 --> 09:16.740
Shut up.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.740
I've waited a long time to do this.

09:22.740 --> 09:25.420
Fuck a real live whore.

09:25.420 --> 09:27.460
Untie me now.

09:27.460 --> 09:28.900
No.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.900
I've paid for you. I'll do what I
want.

09:38.140 --> 09:40.740
This isn't funny. Unlock it, or I'll
scream.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.700
You said we'd spend the night
together.

09:44.260 --> 09:46.220
And we will.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.260
Whether you scream or not.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.780
What was that?

09:55.780 --> 09:56.820
It's nothing.

09:56.820 --> 09:58.420
No, it sounded like Belle.

10:00.540 --> 10:02.620
Bambi. It's a sex party. People make
noises.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.020
Not like that, they don't.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.700
Give me a break.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.860
Belle! Belle!

10:11.940 --> 10:12.940
Belle.

10:14.220 --> 10:15.940
Sorry. Belle!

10:15.940 --> 10:17.820
Belle!

10:19.860 --> 10:20.660
Belle!

10:22.860 --> 10:24.420
This room is busy.

10:24.420 --> 10:26.140
Belle, are you in there?

10:26.980 --> 10:28.020
Give me the gun.

10:28.020 --> 10:28.980
Help me!

10:32.540 --> 10:33.580
Belle! Belle!

10:33.580 --> 10:36.940
You sick bastard. Untie her now.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.180
Piss off. This is none of your
business.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.140
Untie her, or I'll shoot.

10:45.180 --> 10:47.020
I don't like bullies.

10:50.340 --> 10:51.820
Now you say you're sorry.

10:51.820 --> 10:53.860
Say you're sorry.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.180
OK.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.140
I'm sorry.

11:06.180 --> 11:07.380
What the hell is going on?

11:07.380 --> 11:11.020
I caught that Rapunzel slag trying
to nick cards out of my wallet.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.060
And her mate is a fucking psycho.

11:13.060 --> 11:15.100
And she has my gun.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.340
Stop those girls!

11:18.100 --> 11:19.540
Stop them! Stop them!

11:19.540 --> 11:21.500
Shit, Belle. We've got to go.

11:22.460 --> 11:23.540
# OH MY GOD

11:23.540 --> 11:24.980
# Oh my God I can't believe it

11:24.980 --> 11:27.980
# I've never been this far away from
home

11:50.980 --> 11:53.160
# Oh my God I can't believe it #

11:53.160 --> 11:54.200
Are you all right?

11:54.200 --> 11:55.800
We could have died back there.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.280
Yeah, well. Comes with the job.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.240
No. It shouldn't.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.200
Oh, phone. Let's call someone to get
us out of here.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.160
Give it here.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.080
Ben!

12:09.080 --> 12:12.120
Ben, can you hear me, Ben?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.920
Bugger it. No signal.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.080
It's Ben.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.720
Hello?

12:27.720 --> 12:29.200
Hello, Ben. Can you...?

12:30.680 --> 12:32.880
How are you?

12:34.160 --> 12:36.080
Yeah, yeah, good. Um...

12:36.080 --> 12:42.000
Do you know Upper Hinton
Chubhurst Hill area?

12:43.480 --> 12:45.920
Chubhurst Hill? Yeah. Um...

12:45.920 --> 12:47.920
No reason. It's just...
You know, it's...

12:47.920 --> 12:50.960
beautiful at this time of year.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.520
Yeah, OK.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.160
Well, I was just maybe thinking...

13:13.440 --> 13:16.000
Why do people turn like that -
from, like, normal

13:16.000 --> 13:18.080
to completely psychotic?

13:18.080 --> 13:20.320
I don't know.
You win some, you lose some.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.680
I thought it would help.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.720
What would help?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.720
Sex with strangers.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.640
Help what?
Nothing.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.760
The Alex thing?

13:32.760 --> 13:34.640
No. Maybe...

13:34.640 --> 13:36.480
I don't know.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.680
What was his problem, anyway?

13:38.680 --> 13:43.000
Was he possessive, depressive?
Oh, you don't want one of them.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.920
End up killing himself. Make you
feel guilty about it.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.800
He found out that I'm a prostitute.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.680
Oh... Shit.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.720
So what are you going to do?

13:55.720 --> 13:57.680
There's nothing I can do.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.440
Oh... heels!

14:04.240 --> 14:05.920
I need to sit down.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.440
Do you love Alex?

14:20.040 --> 14:22.040
Ever been in love before?

14:22.040 --> 14:24.080
You?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.680
One time.

14:25.680 --> 14:32.200
I was 16. Beautiful, he was.
Really kind.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.040
Once he put a pillow in the bath for
me.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.600
What a lunatic. A pillow.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.760
I think you should just tell him how
you feel.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.800
I already have.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.520
Well, tell him again.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.800
And what if he still doesn't want to
know?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.280
Then you give up.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.160
You don't want to look a complete
cock, do you?

14:54.120 --> 14:55.160
It's Ben.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.120
Ben!

15:05.240 --> 15:07.840
Ben. Don't ask. Ben!

15:07.840 --> 15:09.160
Bambi. Bambi, Ben.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.200
Hi, Ben.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.280
Hey, Bambi.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.800
OK. First stop, Little Red Riding
Hood's gaff.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.040
Are you going to tell me what
happened?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.840
I mean, you don't have to explain,
but...

15:45.400 --> 15:46.400
Thanks.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.400
Do you want a cup of tea?

15:48.400 --> 15:50.440
No. Vanessa will worry.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.480
OK.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.400
I'm sorry for um...

15:54.400 --> 15:57.400
being such a liability recently.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.360
I've just been a bit...

16:01.600 --> 16:03.160
One cup of tea.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.960
Just a minute.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.000
I guess I'll make it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.160
'You have one message.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.680
Message 1:

16:19.080 --> 16:21.480
Belle. I heard about the
royal cock-up.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.480
You were meant to fuck them, not
shoot them.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.240
You owe me commission, plus
damages.'

16:27.280 --> 16:28.320
You're out of jam.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.320
'End of messages.'

16:33.920 --> 16:37.000
You might be in shock, you know.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.440
You probably won't sleep.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.080
Adrenaline.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.200
We'll go clubbing if you like.
What?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.240
Joke.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.120
Oh. Sorry. I'm not er...

16:48.120 --> 16:50.160
Not very funny tonight.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.360
You're never funny.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.160
Yes, I am.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.720
All right. Tell me a joke.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.800
OK.

16:55.800 --> 17:01.080
A man goes into the doctor's,
and he says,

17:01.080 --> 17:02.560
"Hey, doc.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.000
I've got a real problem.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.079
I think I'm obsessed with sex."

17:07.079 --> 17:10.839
And the doctor goes, "I'm just going
to show you some pictures.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.880
So he goes and gets these images out.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.760
Images?

17:14.760 --> 17:18.160
Images. Pictures. Whatever. My joke.
Sorry.

17:18.160 --> 17:23.000
And er, the first picture
is of a cardboard box.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.119
And he says,

17:24.119 --> 17:26.040
"What does this make you think
about?"

17:26.040 --> 17:27.079
And the guy says,

17:27.079 --> 17:30.680
"Two people making love."

17:30.680 --> 17:32.880
And the doctor says,

17:34.720 --> 17:37.240
And then he goes and gets a second
picture.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.320
And it's of an elephant.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.920
And he says,
"What does this make you think of?"

17:42.920 --> 17:47.520
And the man says,
"Two people making love."

17:47.520 --> 17:50.200
And then the doctor says,

17:50.200 --> 17:52.240
"I hate to tell you this, sir.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.840
You really do have a problem.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.040
You're completely obsessed with sex."

18:03.080 --> 18:04.640
Is that it?

18:04.640 --> 18:06.320
Yeah.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.680
Would you stay the night?

18:19.680 --> 18:23.680
You can sleep on the couch.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.680
Please.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.680
OK. Yeah.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.400
Good night, then.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.040
Good night.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.800
# Might have been a while

18:56.800 --> 19:00.000
# Since you've been loved

19:00.000 --> 19:02.880
# Like you should be loved

19:07.920 --> 19:11.440
# Might have been a while

19:11.440 --> 19:12.960
# Since you've been... #

19:12.960 --> 19:15.080
Oh, you're there.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.000
I told it wrong.
What?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.320
The joke.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.760
After the doctor shows him the second
picture, he says,

19:21.760 --> 19:25.440
"I'm terribly sorry to tell you this,
sir, but yes, you do have a problem.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.640
You're completely obsessed with sex."

19:27.640 --> 19:28.680
And the man goes,

19:28.680 --> 19:32.160
"Me? You're the one showing me all
the dirty pictures."

19:37.360 --> 19:39.360
You've got light in your eyes.

19:42.960 --> 19:47.120
I was thinking about what you were
saying about adrenaline,

19:47.120 --> 19:52.360
and how it runs through your body
and you can't really control it.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.360
Do you think it's in there now?

19:56.440 --> 19:59.520
I reckon you'd feel it.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.480
I don't know what I feel any more.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.760
Sometimes I think I can't feel
anything.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.800
That's stupid.

20:06.800 --> 20:07.960
Well, I am stupid.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.600
No you're not.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.440
A bit. I am a bit.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.400
Stupid. Cold.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.920
You're not cold.
Why are you saying this?

20:16.920 --> 20:18.920
Do you think I'm cold?
Of course not.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.360
Can I have a cuddle for a minute?
Yes, you can. Get in.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.920
# Might have been a while

20:33.920 --> 20:37.160
# Since you could trust

20:37.160 --> 20:40.242
# That someone really cares

20:40.242 --> 20:41.706
Hannah

20:46.360 --> 20:48.720
# When people like us

20:48.720 --> 20:53.880
# Meant to go round in pairs

21:02.800 --> 21:08.640
# And summer breeze is
blowing through your window

21:10.840 --> 21:15.840
# And summer breeze is
blowing through your hair

21:18.160 --> 21:21.880
# Something in your eyes

21:21.880 --> 21:25.920
# That took me by surprise

21:27.640 --> 21:34.520
# Don't tell me
that it ain't there #

21:58.520 --> 22:00.480
Sorry.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.440
Me and you are over.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.880
If I wasn't an escort, would we
still be together?

22:07.880 --> 22:10.440
I've packed in escorting.
I'm going to get a job.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.680
We are going to have to give you a
special task only you can do.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.880
I've never felt so disgusted in my
life.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.800
I'm going to keep on making mistakes

22:17.800 --> 22:20.400
until I do the one thing that makes
you love me again.
