KATARA: <i>Water, earth,</i>

00:06.880 --> 00:10.180
<i>fire, air...</i>

00:11.300 --> 00:15.350
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.430 --> 00:18.730
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.770 --> 00:23.690
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

00:23.780 --> 00:25.610
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

00:25.690 --> 00:26.990
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:27.400 --> 00:31.200
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:31.280 --> 00:32.870
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:32.950 --> 00:35.250
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

00:35.330 --> 00:38.000
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:38.960 --> 00:42.250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

01:14.910 --> 01:17.250
The only reason
you should be interrupting me

01:17.330 --> 01:20.040
is if you have news about the Avatar.

01:20.130 --> 01:22.250
Well, there is news, Prince Zuko,

01:22.340 --> 01:23.880
but you might not like it.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.010
Don't get too upset.

01:25.090 --> 01:27.880
Uncle, you taught me that
keeping a level head

01:27.970 --> 01:29.510
is a sign of a great leader.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.100
Now, whatever you have to say,
I'm sure I can take it.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.100
Ok, then.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.270
We have no idea where he is.

01:36.350 --> 01:37.560
What?

01:38.600 --> 01:41.020
You really should open a window
in here.

01:41.110 --> 01:42.270
Give me the map!

01:42.360 --> 01:45.780
There have been multiple sightings
of the Avatar,

01:45.860 --> 01:48.660
but he is impossible to track down.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.200
How am I going to find him, Uncle?

01:50.280 --> 01:53.330
He is clearly a master
of evasive maneuvering.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.540
You have no idea
where you're going, do you?

01:57.620 --> 01:59.420
Well, I know it's near water.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.500
SOKKA: I guess
we're getting close, then.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.630
Momo, marbles, please.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.220
Hey, Katara, check out
this airbending trick.

02:15.640 --> 02:16.930
That's great, Aang.

02:17.020 --> 02:19.560
You didn't even look.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.850
That's great.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.230
But I'm not doing it now.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.770
Stop bugging her, airhead.

02:23.860 --> 02:26.030
You need to give girls space
when they do their sewing.

02:26.150 --> 02:29.570
What does me being a girl
have to do with sewing?

02:29.650 --> 02:30.820
Simple.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.370
Girls are better
at fixing pants than guys,

02:32.450 --> 02:34.700
and guys are better at hunting
and fighting and stuff like that.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.410
It's just the natural order of things.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.700
All done with your pants,

02:37.790 --> 02:39.910
and look what a great job I did.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.750
Wait! I was just kidding!

02:43.840 --> 02:46.090
I can't wear these! Katara, please!

02:46.210 --> 02:47.420
Relax, Sokka.

02:47.510 --> 02:49.590
Where we're going,
you won't need any pants.

02:55.430 --> 02:57.270
SOKKA: We just made
a pit stop yesterday.

02:57.350 --> 02:59.520
Shouldn't we get a little more flying
done before we camp out?

03:00.230 --> 03:01.600
He's right. At this rate,

03:01.690 --> 03:03.520
we won't get to the North Pole
until spring.

03:03.610 --> 03:05.020
But Appa's tired already,

03:05.110 --> 03:06.570
aren't you, boy?

03:06.650 --> 03:07.940
( GRUNTS )

03:08.030 --> 03:10.610
I said, "Aren't you, boy?"

03:10.700 --> 03:12.570
( YAWNS )

03:12.660 --> 03:14.990
Yeah, that was real convincing.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.910
Still, hard to argue
with a 10-ton magical monster.

03:18.330 --> 03:19.330
Look!

03:23.170 --> 03:25.750
That's why we're here... Elephant koi,

03:25.840 --> 03:27.130
and I'm going to ride it.

03:27.210 --> 03:28.960
Katara, you've got to watch me.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.510
Cold!

03:46.230 --> 03:48.270
( LAUGHING )

03:48.360 --> 03:49.480
Woo!

03:49.570 --> 03:51.490
Yeah!

03:55.820 --> 03:56.950
Woo-hoo!

03:59.040 --> 04:00.500
He looks pretty good out there.

04:00.580 --> 04:03.080
Are you kidding?
The fish is doing all the work.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.080
No, Appa!

04:05.170 --> 04:06.380
Don't eat that!

04:12.090 --> 04:13.510
Aw, man.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.260
There's something in the water!

04:24.270 --> 04:25.350
What's wrong?

04:25.440 --> 04:26.480
Aang's in trouble.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.270
- Aang!
- Get out of there!

04:29.480 --> 04:31.820
- Get back here, Aang!
- Come in!

Aah!

04:54.880 --> 04:56.430
What was that thing?

04:56.510 --> 04:57.640
I don't know.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.390
Well, let's not stick around
to find out.

04:59.470 --> 05:00.930
Time to hit the road.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.610
Or we could stay a while.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.200
MAN: You three have some
explaining to do.

05:22.290 --> 05:24.410
GIRL: And if you don't answer
all our questions,

05:24.500 --> 05:26.790
we're throwing you back
in the water with the unagi.

05:26.870 --> 05:28.830
Show yourselves, cowards!

05:31.750 --> 05:34.260
Who are you?
Where are the men who ambushed us?

05:34.340 --> 05:36.550
There were no men. We ambushed you.

05:36.630 --> 05:39.260
Now tell us, who are you
and what are you doing here?

05:39.340 --> 05:40.430
Wait a second.

05:40.510 --> 05:42.600
There's no way a bunch of girls
took us down.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.560
A bunch of girls, huh?

05:44.640 --> 05:47.060
The unagi's going to eat well tonight.

05:47.140 --> 05:49.100
No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it!

05:49.190 --> 05:51.310
My brother's just an idiot sometimes.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.780
AANG: It's my fault.

05:53.860 --> 05:55.030
I'm sorry we came here.

05:55.110 --> 05:56.570
I wanted to ride the elephant koi.

05:56.650 --> 06:00.070
How do we know
you're not Fire Nation spies?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.490
Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far

06:02.580 --> 06:04.620
and we intend to keep it that way.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.040
This island is named for Kyoshi?

06:07.120 --> 06:08.250
I know Kyoshi.

06:08.330 --> 06:09.500
Ha!

06:09.580 --> 06:11.250
How could you possibly know her?

06:11.330 --> 06:15.710
Avatar Kyoshi was born here
400 years ago.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.800
She's been dead for centuries.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.680
I know her because I'm the Avatar.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.050
That's impossible.

06:23.140 --> 06:26.560
The last Avatar was an airbender
who disappeared 100 years ago.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.640
That's me.

06:27.730 --> 06:29.980
Throw the impostor to the unagi.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.860
Aang, do some airbending.

06:37.570 --> 06:38.570

SECOND WOMAN: That's amazing.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.120
It's true.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.160

( CHEERING )

06:57.460 --> 06:58.970
Did you hear the news?

06:59.050 --> 07:00.680

07:00.760 --> 07:02.050
Huh?

07:03.260 --> 07:04.760
( NO AUDIO )

07:10.520 --> 07:12.270
The Avatar's on Kyoshi island?

07:13.060 --> 07:14.860
Uncle, ready the rhinos.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.900
He's not getting away from me
this time.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.990
Are you going to finish that?

07:19.070 --> 07:20.990
I was going to save it for later!

07:39.840 --> 07:41.130
All right!

07:41.220 --> 07:42.510
Dessert for breakfast!

07:42.720 --> 07:46.300
These people sure know
how to treat an Avatar.

07:46.390 --> 07:48.430
Mm! Katara, you've got to try these.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.140
Well, maybe just a bite.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.270
Sokka, what's your problem?

07:54.350 --> 07:55.400
Eat!

07:55.480 --> 07:56.480
I'm not hungry.

07:56.690 --> 07:58.320
But you're always hungry.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.780
He's just upset
because a bunch of girls

08:00.860 --> 08:02.320
kicked his butt yesterday.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.570
They snuck up on me!

08:03.660 --> 08:05.870
Right, and then they kicked your butt.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.200
Sneak attacks don't count.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.870
Tie me up with ropes...

08:09.950 --> 08:12.000
I'll show them a thing or two.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.790
I'm not scared of any girls.

08:13.870 --> 08:15.920
Who do they think they are, anyway?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.880
Mm! This is tasty.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.460
What's he so angry about?

08:20.550 --> 08:21.590
It's great here.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.170
They're giving us the royal treatment.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.090
Hey, don't get too comfortable.

08:25.180 --> 08:27.760
It's risky for us to stay
in one place for very long.

08:27.850 --> 08:29.310
I'm sure we'll be fine.

08:29.390 --> 08:32.020
Besides, did you see how happy
I'm making this town?

08:32.100 --> 08:34.140
They're even cleaning up
that statue in my honor.

08:34.230 --> 08:37.650
Well, it's nice to see you excited
about being the Avatar.

08:37.730 --> 08:39.440
I just hope it doesn't
all go to your head.

12:00.350 --> 12:03.600
What's taking you so long, Aangie?

12:03.690 --> 12:04.690
Aangie?

12:04.770 --> 12:06.230
Just a second, Koko.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.900
Simple monk, huh?

12:07.980 --> 12:09.940
I thought you promised
me this Avatar stuff

12:10.030 --> 12:11.030
wouldn't go to your head.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.200
It didn't. You know what I think?

12:13.280 --> 12:15.740
You just don't want to come
because you're jealous.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.530
Jealous? Of what?

12:17.620 --> 12:19.870
Jealous that we're having
so much fun without you.

12:19.950 --> 12:21.160
That's ridiculous.

12:21.290 --> 12:22.580
It is a little ridiculous,

12:22.660 --> 12:23.660
but I understand.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.630
Ugh!

12:26.830 --> 12:29.050
( GIGGLING )

12:36.010 --> 12:37.760
Uh, hey, Suki.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.390
Hoping for another dance lesson?

12:40.470 --> 12:41.640
No, I...

12:41.720 --> 12:42.850
Well, let me explain.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.350
Spit it out. What do you want?

12:48.360 --> 12:50.900
I would be honored
if you would teach me.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.530
Even if I'm a girl?

12:52.610 --> 12:54.650
I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier.

12:54.740 --> 12:55.780
I was wrong.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.030
We normally don't teach outsiders,

12:58.120 --> 12:59.910
let alone boys.

12:59.990 --> 13:01.370
Please make an exception.

13:01.450 --> 13:02.500
I won't let you down.

13:02.620 --> 13:06.250
All right, but you have to follow
all of our traditions.

13:06.330 --> 13:07.380
Of course.

13:07.460 --> 13:09.630
And I mean all of them.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.630
Do I really have to wear this?

13:12.840 --> 13:14.800
It feels a little... Girly.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.510
It's a warrior's uniform.

13:16.590 --> 13:17.720
You should be proud.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.510
The silk thread symbolizes

13:19.600 --> 13:21.890
the brave blood
that flows through our veins.

13:21.970 --> 13:23.640
The gold insignia represents

13:23.720 --> 13:25.310
the honor of the warrior's heart.

13:27.020 --> 13:28.650
Bravery and honor.

13:28.730 --> 13:29.940
Hey, Sokka.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.150
Nice dress.

13:41.080 --> 13:45.160
Katara, remember how
the unagi almost got me yesterday?

13:45.250 --> 13:46.290
Yeah.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.210
Well, I'm going to go ride it now.

13:48.290 --> 13:49.920
It's going to be real dangerous.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.170
Good for you.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.290
You're not going to stop me?

13:52.380 --> 13:53.670
Nope. Have fun.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.010
I will. Great.

13:55.090 --> 13:56.130
I know it's great.

13:56.220 --> 13:57.260
Well, I'm glad you know.

13:57.340 --> 13:58.430
- I'm glad you're glad.
- Good!

13:58.510 --> 13:59.510
Fine!

14:06.850 --> 14:08.770
You're not going to master it
in one day.

14:08.850 --> 14:10.230
Even I'm not that good.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.980
I think I'm starting to get it.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.240
It's not about strength.

14:24.490 --> 14:27.500
Our technique is about using
your opponent's force against them.

14:27.580 --> 14:28.830
Loosen up.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.960
Think of the fan as an extension
of your arm.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.750
Wait for an opening and then...

14:37.420 --> 14:38.420
Hmm.

14:39.010 --> 14:41.300
I fell on purpose
to make you feel better.

14:41.390 --> 14:42.390
I got you!

14:42.470 --> 14:43.470
Admit I got you!

14:45.350 --> 14:47.600
Ok, it was a lucky shot.

14:47.810 --> 14:49.770
Let's see if you can do it again.

14:56.570 --> 14:58.240
What's taking so long?

14:58.320 --> 15:00.700
I'm sure it will be here any second.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.990
Um, what about this?

15:05.080 --> 15:06.540
Not that again.

15:06.620 --> 15:07.700
Boring.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.210
Where's unagi?

15:09.410 --> 15:10.460
It's getting late.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.040
Where are you going?

15:12.120 --> 15:13.130
Don't leave!

15:13.500 --> 15:14.670
Sorry, Aang!

15:14.750 --> 15:15.920
Maybe next time!

15:21.050 --> 15:22.550
Katara, you showed up!

15:22.640 --> 15:24.930
I wanted to make sure you were safe.

15:25.010 --> 15:26.260
You really had me worried.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.430
Back there you acted like
you didn't care.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.020
I'm sorry.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.350
Me, too.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.600
I did let all that attention
go to my head.

15:33.690 --> 15:35.190
I was being a jerk.

15:35.270 --> 15:36.520
Well, get out of the water

15:36.610 --> 15:38.440
before you catch a cold, you big jerk!

15:39.610 --> 15:40.780
On my way!

16:27.740 --> 16:29.160
Hang on, Aang!

16:29.240 --> 16:30.410
Aah!

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
Aang!

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
KATARA: Zuko!

17:24.550 --> 17:26.090
I want the Avatar alive.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.940
Wake up, Aang.

17:49.870 --> 17:51.950
( COUGHS )

17:52.030 --> 17:53.040
Katara.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.910
Don't ride the unagi.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.420
Not fun.

18:05.130 --> 18:06.340
Not bad.

18:08.050 --> 18:10.050
Fire bandits have landed
on our shores.

18:10.140 --> 18:11.850
Girls, come quickly!

18:11.930 --> 18:13.720
Hey, I'm not a...

18:13.810 --> 18:15.470
Oh, whatever.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.110
Come out, Avatar.

18:23.190 --> 18:24.610
You can't hide from me forever.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.370
Find him.

19:08.650 --> 19:10.360
I guess training's over.

19:22.540 --> 19:24.000
Nice try, Avatar,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.420
but these little girls can't save you.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.550
AANG: Hey, over here!

19:30.420 --> 19:31.550
Finally.

20:11.380 --> 20:12.670
Get inside.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.470
Look what I brought to this place.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.680
It's not your fault.

20:19.770 --> 20:21.060
Yes, it is.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.890
These people got their town destroyed
trying to protect me.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.270
Then let's get out of here.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.310
Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.820
I know it feels wrong to run,

20:29.020 --> 20:30.230
but I think it's the only way.

20:31.490 --> 20:32.900
I'll call Appa.

20:39.580 --> 20:41.410
There's no time to say good-bye.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.790
What about "I'm sorry"?

20:42.870 --> 20:43.870
For what?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.170
I treated you like a girl

20:45.250 --> 20:47.040
when I should have
treated you like a warrior.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.670
I am a warrior...

20:50.630 --> 20:52.300
But I'm a girl, too.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.510
Now get out of here.

20:55.590 --> 20:56.930
We'll hold them off.

21:00.890 --> 21:02.390
Appa, yip yip!

21:05.140 --> 21:06.480
Back to the ship!

21:06.560 --> 21:08.190
Don't lose sight of them!

21:12.030 --> 21:14.400
I know it's hard,
but you did the right thing.

21:14.490 --> 21:17.200
Zuko would've destroyed
the whole place if we stayed.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.740
They're going to be ok, Aang.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.660
KATARA: What are you doing?

22:00.530 --> 22:02.120
Thank you, Avatar.

22:03.660 --> 22:05.330
I know, I know,

22:05.410 --> 22:07.040
that was stupid and dangerous.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.170
Yes, it was.
