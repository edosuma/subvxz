01:23.167 --> 01:24.250
Hi.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.299
What's with the girls?

01:31.383 --> 01:33.092
It's a little pick-me-up for Vince.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.011
What better way to get over a breakup

01:35.095 --> 01:36.929
than a $1,500 wake-up call?

01:37.014 --> 01:38.431
Come on, guys. Hookers?

01:38.515 --> 01:40.224
He needs to get out of bed, not stay in it.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.393
They're not hookers, E.
They're entrepreneurs.

01:42.478 --> 01:44.312
Yeah, E, don't be sexist.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.938
These girls own their own company.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.024
It's called "Breakfast In Bed. "

01:48.108 --> 01:51.444
One girl massages
while the other one feeds you.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.695
And the other one even reads to you.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.572
They have a nice selection of books, too.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.449
And all the day's periodicals.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.034
- Any sign of Vince?
Uh-uh.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.286
No, but I heard what sounded like weeping

02:00.370 --> 02:02.288
coming from his room this morning.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.832
- Some day, huh?
- Why, what else?

02:04.917 --> 02:07.043
I guess Ari's really done at the agency.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.877
Says here security escorted him out.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.378
Wow!

02:11.381 --> 02:14.801
Oh, man, I hope this doesn't affect
my status over there.

02:14.885 --> 02:18.471
I'm sure you're still their least
important client, Drama. Don't worry.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.057
- Our world is crumbling.
- Yeah, might as well drink then, huh?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.434
- How can you stay so calm?
- Come on, guys, chin up.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.812
If Vince ain't doing Aquaman,
you guys don't need to worry.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.814
Vince is doing Aquaman. Believe me.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.149
When he wakes up he'll realize
what he was saying was nuts.

02:30.234 --> 02:31.400
Even Vince isn't that crazy.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.528
Just in case he is, don't worry.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.571
- You guys are covered.
- Yeah, how?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.323
Saigon's showcase.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.826
This kid's gonna be a star. Guaranteed.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.078
Once he blows up, we're on easy street.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.832
- You better make that a double, Drama.
- I better call my agent.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.377
- What's up?
- Mornin'.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.337
- Yo.
- What's up, guys?

02:51.421 --> 02:53.631
Hey, shouldn't you
be gettin' oiled up?

02:53.715 --> 02:56.634
Yeah, guys, I appreciate the gesture
but I sent the girls home.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.595
What?
- Vince, we prepaid that shit.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.639
Hey, E, did you track down Ari?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.641
Yep.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.853
Jesus.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.147
Did you tell him I'm not doing Aquaman?

03:10.232 --> 03:12.692
- I can't find him.
- Well, you better go find him.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.527
Vince, you're not quitting, all right?

03:14.611 --> 03:16.028
You start shooting in three days.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.697
Well, that's why you better tell him soon.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.532
I'm gonna go walk on the beach.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.660
I'm gonna end up living back by the freeway.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.079
All right, everybody,
stop your fuckin' whining.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.664
Drama, stop your drinking,

03:26.748 --> 03:29.125
'cause we gotta drive
one of these invites over to Dr. Dre.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.460
- Let's go.
- Why do I have to stop drinking?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.796
Last time I checked, Mr. Rap Mogul,

03:33.881 --> 03:35.381
you were still a driver.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.926
Yeah, hi. Adam Davies' office, please.

03:39.011 --> 03:42.430
Vince, can we talk about this?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.223
E, thanks.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.642
I don't need to talk. I need to walk.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.896
Listen, Vince, it hurts, I know.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.397
I've been there, all right?

03:51.481 --> 03:54.150
You will get over Mandy. This will pass.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.359
Good.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.654
So that's it? Game over?

03:59.489 --> 04:00.656
Yeah.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.411
I thought we make these decisions together.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.079
No, not this one.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.582
Please don't try and
make me feel guilty about it.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.126
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty,
all right?

04:12.210 --> 04:14.420
I'm just seriously concerned about our future.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.838
You don't understand.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.214
I feel like I got shot.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.716
No, Vince, you don't understand.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.885
We may never get
an opportunity like this again.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.095
Whose future are you really concerned about?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.097
- Ours or yours?
- Are you fuckin' serious?

04:25.182 --> 04:26.891
Yeah. I am. 'Cause I'm not doing this movie.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.143
And if you can't understand why,
you better think about

04:29.227 --> 04:31.145
whether you want to be a part of my future.

04:34.566 --> 04:38.569
Eric, unless I spread a false rumor
that Mandy has genital warts,

04:38.654 --> 04:41.072
there is no way for me
to spin this in Vincent's favor!

04:41.156 --> 04:43.115
I can't hear you when you're yelling at me.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.368
- Just go work your magic.
- I'm a publicist,

04:45.452 --> 04:47.954
not David Blaine.
Now what the fuck did you say to him?

04:48.038 --> 04:49.121
He doesn't listen to me.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.539
Then what's he pay you for?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.208
Yeah, good question.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.089
Hi.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.591
I've been trying to get you
on the phone for 12 hours.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.054
I want you and Vince to know

05:05.138 --> 05:07.264
everything is under control, all right?

05:07.349 --> 05:10.226
I am fully functional,
and I'm setting up my own shop.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.478
That's great.
Mandy and Chris got back together.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.981
- Jesus Christ.
- He wants off the movie.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.983
I'm already having a bad day. Come on!

05:17.067 --> 05:18.484
You gotta call Cameron.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.570
Don't go soft on me now.
Come on, we're at a life crossroads here.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.823
- I've done all I can do.
- You've done all you can do?

05:23.907 --> 05:26.283
What the fuck does that mean?
What, you want to quit, too?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.160
Actually, I think I might, yeah.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.997
E, the garbage man who wins the lottery

05:31.081 --> 05:32.999
does not throw out the ticket.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.625
You know what, fuck you. Call Cameron.

05:34.710 --> 05:35.751
Fuck you! You call!

05:35.836 --> 05:38.504
If you want to work with Vince again,
you'll call. It's that simple.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.549
No one will want to work with Vince if I call.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.175
You think he was cold three months ago?

05:43.260 --> 05:45.177
After this, I won't be able
to put him in an iFilm.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.430
You tell him that directly, okay? I tried.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.183
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll figure something out.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.852
No, you won't.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.228
'Cause you're fucked.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.022
Do you even know how fucked you are?

05:56.106 --> 05:58.274
I mean, you are so fucking fucked.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.318
I think you're the most fucked person I know.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.530
Shit. Here comes the wife.
Just pretend like it's all good.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.117
- You didn't tell your wife?
- No. When the time is right, yeah.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.577
It's on the cover of Variety.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.705
She doesn't read Variety. She reads InStyle.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.082
- Hey, baby.
- Why aren't you at work?

06:15.167 --> 06:18.169
- I overslept.
- Hey.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.671
- So what's in the gym bag?
- It's a kilo of blow.

06:20.756 --> 06:24.133
- What's with all the fucking questions?
- He's showing off for you.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.516
Say goodbye to that Maserati.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.602
I see a shiny new Vespa in your future.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.145
Good luck in the Indy 500.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.647
- Morning, E.
- Morning, Lloyd.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.983
Don't say good morning to him.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.945
- Where to?
- Malibu. Pronto, Tonto.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.656
Eric, you know you guys are gonna make up.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.909
Vince can't last five minutes without you.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.327
It's not even about that.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.080
- I'm almost 30 years old.
- You're not even 29.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.666
Three weeks. And I'm an idiot
for putting myself in this position.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.252
I'm pissed at Vince,
but I'm more pissed at myself

07:00.337 --> 07:02.505
because it's nuts to tie yourself to one guy,

07:02.589 --> 07:04.090
especially a guy you can't count on.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.342
Eric, you could've never
predicted this happening.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.636
Eighth grade he bailed on
the great adventure trip

07:08.720 --> 07:10.387
to make ceramic frogs with Jen Naidich.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.848
- The handwriting was on the wall.
- He's your best friend.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.643
That's a classic example of why
you shouldn't do business with your friends.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.938
- So what are you going to do?
- I have no clue.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.606
You know, Ari's right. I'm so fucked.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.691
You are not so fucked.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.527
Eric, what I think you should do is think about

07:24.611 --> 07:26.654
finding a real job in this business,

07:26.738 --> 07:28.697
one with some stability.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.616
Sloan, I'm a college dropout.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.952
Guys in the mailroom out here
have Wharton MBAs.

07:33.036 --> 07:36.497
- You have experience.
- Not that anyone knows about.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.374
I know some people who know about it.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.042
Maybe I can help.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.754
Positivity, Drama.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.757
You got to learn
to find positivity in every situation.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.301
There is no positivity here, Turtle, forget it.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.137
Vince is imploding.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.848
He needs to take on a Zen-like approach.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.433
- It's all in the breathing.
- So what do we do?

07:56.518 --> 07:59.645
- We gotta let him know he's fucking up.
- How?

07:59.729 --> 08:01.397
Silent treatment.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.608
- Good plan.
- Are you in or not?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.694
I'm in. I'm in.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.238
This is it.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.906
Dr. Dre gets his hair cut here?

08:10.991 --> 08:13.284
No, Dre don't leave the house to get a haircut.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.119
The stylist here goes to him.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.620
Since when do you know stylists?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.914
I don't. I know a shampoo girl,

08:18.999 --> 08:21.584
she knows the stylist,
she's gonna hook it all up.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.044
Is that cool?
Anything else you need to know?

08:26.715 --> 08:28.591
Adam Davies' office, please.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.676
Ari, you don't have to sell me.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.510
I'm not staying with Terrance.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.472
I'm a loyal guy. So, where you go, I go.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.349
That's great news, Vinnie.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.019
That is great news, huh? Give it up.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.104
I love it.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.607
You're still gonna act, though, right?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.358
You gonna bring up Aquaman again?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.861
I thought you said you weren't here for that.
I wouldn't have let you in.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.447
That was before I knew that you were with me.
Now that I know,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.532
back to business. I'm representing, baby!

08:53.617 --> 08:56.202
Give me a few weeks
and then we can talk about work.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.996
Anyway, what did Cameron say?
Was he upset?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.707
- Waiting for a call back.
- Just call him, Ari. Get it over with.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.792
I will, Vinnie. Hear me out first. Please.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.545
Maybe I should stay with Terrance,
'cause you obviously don't get me.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.964
You think Terrance gets you?
When he hears about this,

09:09.049 --> 09:10.841
you will never hear from him again.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.885
- I swear to God.
- So I'll find someone else.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.888
You gonna find someone to replace E?

09:15.972 --> 09:18.474
- You gonna cut him loose, too?
- E's just a little mad at me.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.100
He'll get over it. He always does.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.395
I don't think so, man.
He sounded like he was pretty upset.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.688
Sounded like he's moving on.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.690
- Yeah? Where to, Ari?
- Yeah.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.818
I mean, it's sad to say,
but the guy's got no options.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.614
Wow, Vinnie,
heartbreak's made you cold, man.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.157
Just make the call.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.466
How'd it go?

09:52.550 --> 09:54.718
How did the fucking Bay of Pigs go, Lloyd?

10:03.228 --> 10:05.187
Give me my bag, Christy.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.398
Thank you.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.152
- What do you think you can do?
- Watch me.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.737
You couldn't even keep me out of Variety.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.823
There's no suppressing the truth, Ari!

10:18.368 --> 10:20.077
Vincent, open the door!

10:20.161 --> 10:22.288
Vincent! Open the door!

10:22.372 --> 10:24.498
I don't want to talk about it anymore, Shauna.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.668
Oh, come on, Vincent!
Don't you dare fuckin' walk away from me!

10:27.752 --> 10:29.003
We need to talk!

10:30.338 --> 10:32.047
- Fucking loser.
- Open the fucking door!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.717
Look, baby, I am here because I love you.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.427
I know how you're feeling.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.471
I'm twice divorced, baby. I know it is hell!

10:40.181 --> 10:42.975
Don't make me kick this fucking thing in!
Open the fucking door!

10:43.059 --> 10:46.562
- Shit! Fuck you, man!
- That's solid work, Shauna.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.314
Oh, fuck you! If you did your job right,

10:48.398 --> 10:51.400
I wouldn't be out here
cleaning up your goddamn mess!

10:53.611 --> 10:57.239
We all start out believing
that our clients care about us,

10:57.324 --> 10:59.950
but in reality, they don't.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.494
There's only one way to look at clients.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.705
- How's that?
- Like stocks.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.958
Invest without emotion. Diversify.

11:08.043 --> 11:11.086
I don't know that I could look
at someone that I work with like a 401 k.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.921
That's because you're an idealist.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.465
I could use one of those.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.304
Fuck Terrance.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.473
Are you coming with me, yes or no?

11:22.557 --> 11:24.183
- Am I coming with you?
- Yeah.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.643
Are you gonna put me in movies, yes or no?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.771
I put you in a movie, Ray.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.522
Are you kidding me? You were brilliant.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.358
You didn't even see the fucking thing.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.568
- I see all my clients' movies, come on.
- Really?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.820
- Who was I?
- You were the white guy, Richard.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.822
- Making fun of me, Ari?
- I'm not making fun of you.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.283
You tell me what you want,
let's make it happen.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.995
I wanna be in action movies.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.039
I wanna be the tough guy.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.209
I wanna say,
"Cocksucking, motherfucking cunt,"

11:50.293 --> 11:53.587
in a Scorsese movie
for once in my fucking life.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.339
I wanna scare people.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.424
You're scaring me, Richard.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.347
Are you gonna deliver this, Ari?

12:03.431 --> 12:05.516
- Are you with me or against me?
- Am I with you?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.851
We're in a fucking Coffee Bean here, Ari!

12:07.936 --> 12:09.603
- Ari, excuse me.
- Not now, Lloyd.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.189
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- It's really important.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.691
Excuse me for one second, Richard.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.361
By the muffins.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.822
I just got off the phone
with my mole at the agency.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.281
Who are you? Deep Throat?

12:21.366 --> 12:23.867
E was just in there.
Terrance offered him a job.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.411
As what? His fucking pool boy?

12:25.495 --> 12:27.371
As an agent, Ari.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.250
- Give me your phone.
- I'm way over my minutes.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.835
Give me your fucking phone!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.422
Where you going, Richard?

12:36.506 --> 12:39.258
- To use the bathroom, Ari.
- Give him a token, Lloyd.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.721
Loving the new company.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.151
Talk to Cameron?
- Not yet.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.237
- Don't call me till you do.
- Listen, Vinnie! Vinnie!

13:07.078 --> 13:08.370
Did you guys eat lunch yet?

13:08.455 --> 13:11.790
I left four messages today
and three e-mails.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.585
If Adam Davies is still my agent,
I want a call back!

13:14.669 --> 13:16.628
I got Dre at his hair salon,

13:16.713 --> 13:18.380
Dash at the Kiehl's store,

13:18.465 --> 13:21.258
Just Blaze at Niketown. It's gonna be all good.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.886
- Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
- That's what's up.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.221
A'ight, man. Peace.
- Later.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.686
Yo, did you guys eat lunch?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.647
What the fuck?

13:40.445 --> 13:42.821
- What the fuck, Ari?
- Vinnie, listen to me.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.866
E does have options.
Terrance offered him a job.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.994
- As what?
- As an agent. He's gone.

13:49.078 --> 13:52.456
He's gonna be living
with his rich girl in a big fat house.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.792
And if you don't go back to work,
you're gonna be living in his guesthouse.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.086
Fuck you, Ari. Just call Cameron.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.339
No go, Vinnie. You want that,

14:00.798 --> 14:02.883
be a man, you call him yourself.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.927
You're fired, Ari.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.055
Not the first time, Vinnie.

14:11.893 --> 14:15.437
Did you guys hear something
about E getting a job offer?

14:21.986 --> 14:24.613
Oh, okay, good.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.950
All right, I get it!
You know what? Fuck you guys!

14:38.044 --> 14:40.254
- What are you doing?
- Going for a drive.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.256
You don't drive.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.554
Fuck!

14:49.681 --> 14:50.722
Are you okay?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.474
Did you take a job without talking to me?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.601
Who told you that?

14:54.686 --> 14:57.688
You know, of all people
to not get what I'm going through,

14:57.772 --> 14:59.565
the heartbreak kid himself.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.568
I mean, how many times
have I heard you cry like a little pussy

15:02.652 --> 15:04.653
- over a girl?
- Not over a girl I barely know.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.072
- Oh, so it's not real?
- You know, personally, Vince,

15:07.156 --> 15:10.158
I think it's your ego.
Your big fuckin' movie star ego.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.494
You could've had Mandy
thrown off this movie,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.580
but you had to prove that
you could get her back.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.374
You can't stand the fact that
she left you 'cause no one ever has.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.710
But you know what?
I will leave you before you fuck me up.

15:19.794 --> 15:23.213
Yeah, leave and do what?
Live off your girlfriend instead of me?

15:23.715 --> 15:26.300
You ever think that Terrance
offered you the job to get to me?

15:26.384 --> 15:29.011
Yeah, I did think that,
and that's why I told him if I took the job,

15:29.095 --> 15:31.597
it meant I'd never work with you again,
and he still offered it.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.474
- Don't be here when I get back.
- Like I fuckin' would be!

15:37.937 --> 15:39.354
This is fuckin' nuts, E.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.815
- Where you gonna go?
- Sloan's.

15:41.899 --> 15:45.152
Is it too much to ask for a fucking
call back from one's own agent?

15:45.236 --> 15:46.612
I think not!

15:46.696 --> 15:48.947
You tell Davies he will call me back

15:49.032 --> 15:51.867
or he will see me at the office
for a face to face!

15:57.707 --> 15:59.791
Are you still gonna come
to Saigon's showcase tonight?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.710
You know it. He's gonna kill.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.463
See you, Drama.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.797
Later, E.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.205
You told Vince about Terrance?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.706
One last shot, Eric.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.542
I thought the threat of losing you
might wake this kid up.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.670
Yeah, well, it didn't.
He threw me out of the house.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.630
- He fired me.
- Really?

16:46.714 --> 16:49.132
Yeah, listen, let's get together.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.051
- I need to talk to you.
- Forget it, Ari.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.804
The next time you see me,
we'll be fighting over clients.

16:53.888 --> 16:57.057
One last chat, Eric,
at our old stomping grounds.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.400
Johnny, he's in a meeting!

17:06.483 --> 17:08.734
Are you seriously not gonna call me back?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.278
Look what the breeze just blew in.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.239
Shut the fuck up, Pauly, I'm not in the mood.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.615
Sorry, Johnny. It's a busy day.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.575
Are you my agent or not?

17:19.622 --> 17:21.080
You were a family deal, Johnny.

17:21.749 --> 17:25.377
If Vince isn't a client,
I'm afraid you're not a client.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.005
Karma is a bitch!

17:30.133 --> 17:31.717
No, not here, Drama!

17:31.801 --> 17:34.386
Come on,
we're in a fucking meeting, man.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.305
You promised me something out of this deal.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.975
You're taking his TV? What are you a fucking

17:40.059 --> 17:42.310
Surreal Life cast member? You freak.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.354
What a putz.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.232
- I'll see you on the outside.
- Get a life, loser boy!

17:50.653 --> 17:53.238
We had some good battles here, huh, E?

17:53.322 --> 17:55.532
Yeah. This could be the last one.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.994
No more battles. Look at this.
See me waving the flag?

17:59.078 --> 18:02.497
- What are we doing here?
- What, two friends can't have dinner?

18:03.249 --> 18:05.667
What, we're not friends? Huh?

18:06.502 --> 18:08.503
- I'm thinking.
- I'm gonna tell you something.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.424
Vince is the only client I've ever had

18:12.508 --> 18:14.009
that I considered a friend.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.428
All right, the only one I really cared about.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.096
I mean Jessica Biel, too,

18:18.181 --> 18:21.641
but you know I cared about her
for very different reasons.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.435
I appreciate that.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.687
Do you appreciate
the friendship you and Vince have?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.606
'Cause there aren't too many people
your age who have

18:27.690 --> 18:29.357
a lifelong friendship like that.

18:29.442 --> 18:33.278
I can't tell you what one person
that I went to high school with is doing.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.697
What's the point?
I know you're getting at something here.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.450
You told Vinnie not to fuck up.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.286
He fucked up. You feel betrayed, you feel hurt.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.288
You think that what he did was selfish.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.457
- You're telling me it wasn't?
- I'm telling you

18:45.541 --> 18:47.459
he's not thinking rationally.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.961
'Cause when he wakes up
in a week or a month

18:50.046 --> 18:52.297
or three months from now, and he realizes

18:52.381 --> 18:55.050
that he fucked his whole life up,

18:56.093 --> 18:57.803
you're gonna need to be there,

18:57.887 --> 19:00.222
'cause he's gonna have no one else.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.727
Wow, I'm impressed, Ari.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.771
A totally selfless meal.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.066
Well, you're buying
'cause you've got a goddamn job.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.365
You ready?

19:18.449 --> 19:20.617
Look at this place, it's set to pop.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.371
There's not one big player
in this motherfucker, man.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.498
Not one.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.375
There's Snoop's dawg right here.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.335
Yo, Z. Where Snoop at?

19:30.419 --> 19:32.295
Yo, what up, man? He ain't makin' it, though.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.256
But I'm here to represent. What's up, man?

19:34.340 --> 19:35.841
What up?

19:35.925 --> 19:37.175
It's all good, a'ight?

19:37.260 --> 19:39.511
You're going on soon, so get yourself ready.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.388
- Trust me.
- A'ight.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.641
I'm so fucked!

19:45.184 --> 19:46.726
They sent all their assistants.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.020
No Dre, no Dash, no nothin'.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.399
Turtle, I got no career,
no representation and no hope,

19:52.483 --> 19:54.359
so stop your fuckin' crying.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.027
The CEOs might not be here,

19:56.112 --> 19:58.196
but there's a lot of people here.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.323
You did a good job, Turtle.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.825
Thanks, Drama.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.577
And look who did show.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.332
This is pretty exciting.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.378
All right, you know what?

20:13.462 --> 20:15.088
If you're not gonna talk to me, I'm gonna go.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.800
If we're gonna talk to you, bro,

20:18.885 --> 20:20.302
we're gonna tell you how we feel.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.804
Tell me tomorrow. Tonight's Turtle's night.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.807
Thanks for coming, Vin.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.686
Hey, we love you, Vince.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.355
Any word from E?

20:32.440 --> 20:34.316
Right here, movie star.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.402
Shouldn't you be at
some agency function or something?

20:37.486 --> 20:39.446
I'm here for Turtle.
I'm not here to fight with you.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.281
Can I have a beer?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.784
So, E, I said some things.

20:44.869 --> 20:48.079
Yeah, I said some things, too.
Let's leave it at that.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.372
Okay.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.376
I mean, you should know I called Cameron.

20:53.461 --> 20:56.421
- Yeah? What did he say?
- I'm meeting him tomorrow.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.006
I figured I should talk to him face to face.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.343
Yeah, it's the right thing to do.
I'll go with you.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.553
You gonna try and talk me out of it again?

21:03.638 --> 21:05.639
Nope. Done doing that.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.603
So are you going as my manager?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.439
No. I'm going as your friend.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.567
Yeah, yeah, what's up, y'all?

21:17.652 --> 21:20.445
Let's get it right. Come on, come on.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.447
Let's get it poppin' up in here.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.990
Yeah!

21:24.951 --> 21:26.242
Rock with me.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.663
Put your hands in the air,
back and forth! Yeah!

22:04.991 --> 22:07.242
Hey, Aquaman himself.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.285
Let's go.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.329
So are you ready for the ride of your life?

22:11.414 --> 22:12.497
Yeah.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.332
Gotta be careful what you wish for.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.126
So are you good, huh?

22:16.210 --> 22:18.378
I am so pumped about this.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.172
I feel it, and when I feel it,
you know it's gonna be good.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.758
I haven't had this kind of connection
between the actor and the role

22:23.843 --> 22:25.343
since I set Arnold in Terminator.

22:25.428 --> 22:28.346
The thing about Aquaman
is there's a vulnerability to him

22:28.431 --> 22:29.973
which you're gonna be perfect for.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.683
Aquaman is the voice of the ocean.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.227
So you're really
gonna take the job, E?

22:34.311 --> 22:35.729
Of course he's gonna take the job.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.564
I can already see his future.

22:37.648 --> 22:40.942
He's gonna move in with Sloan,
drive her daddy's Bentley,

22:41.027 --> 22:43.319
and join a country club that restricts us.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.240
I'm gonna get some air.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.910
This is you defending the underwater city.

22:50.995 --> 22:53.079
And we're gonna do it all dry for wet,

22:53.164 --> 22:54.497
so you'll be hanging on wires.

22:54.582 --> 22:57.333
You won't really be underwater.
You're gonna love that.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.420
Actually, it's terrible,
but it's only for the first month.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.339
And, you know,

23:04.300 --> 23:06.134
I'm into this, okay?

23:06.218 --> 23:07.802
Sorry, I'm going on.

23:08.137 --> 23:11.473
You called me.
What is it you want to talk about?

23:12.808 --> 23:13.850
Yeah.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.101
Jim...

23:15.978 --> 23:17.896
This is gonna be tough.

23:18.731 --> 23:22.233
- I'm not taking the job.
- Come on, what, are you crazy?

23:22.318 --> 23:25.236
- Or stupid?
- Vince pulled me out of a pizza place.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.863
Besides, I'm not even 29 years old.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.531
I'm not wearing a suit to work every day.

23:28.616 --> 23:29.783
So we're all fucked.

23:29.867 --> 23:32.410
Yeah, well, at least we're all fucked together.

23:33.162 --> 23:36.539
Well, here he is. It's over, so be supportive.

23:36.624 --> 23:37.957
All right.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.880
How'd it go?
- It went.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.636
- What did that mean?
- What did he say?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.054
Did he go crazy?

23:51.138 --> 23:52.597
He didn't threaten you, did he?

23:52.681 --> 23:55.058
- No.
- You didn't do it, did you?

23:56.185 --> 23:58.144
Yeah, I'm right.
I can tell by the look on your face.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.854
You didn't quit.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.274
All right, look, E.
I know you put this whole thing together,

24:03.359 --> 24:05.318
but I'm the one
who's gotta work with her every day.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.986
I didn't think I could do that.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.531
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.783
What do you think I'm doing here?

24:11.867 --> 24:13.409
But did you quit the movie or not?

24:13.911 --> 24:16.121
No. I couldn't do it.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.539
You were right.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.041
- Oh, yeah, bro!
- But I was ready to, though.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.211
I sat there and
I looked Cameron right in the eyes.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.463
Then I thought about my boys.
I couldn't let you down.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.006
- Yeah, right.
- Bullshit, bro.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.217
- You were scared of Cameron!
- A little bit.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.552
He already had these made.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.638
Christ, look at the man-gina on this guy.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.848
Oh, my God!

24:34.932 --> 24:36.266
The silent treatment was good, guys.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.351
But you should've heard this guy
yelling at me yesterday.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.811
Nobody's yelled at me like that in years.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.480
- Really?
- Yeah? How'd it feel?

24:42.565 --> 24:44.899
It felt good. It felt like home.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.569
So what, are we back in business?

24:47.653 --> 24:50.321
I don't know. Can you promise me
this will never happen again?

24:50.406 --> 24:52.949
First love only happens once, E.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.826
Twice for me, bro.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.870
Both broads crushed me equally.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.455
- I never been in love.
- Turtle.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.875
Get off me! Get off me!

25:03.169 --> 25:05.336
So should we call Ari?

25:05.421 --> 25:08.339
No, let's let him sweat it out a day or two.

25:09.305 --> 25:15.622
