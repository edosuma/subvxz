My story's like many of yours.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.991

in Selfridge's in accessories,

11:39.157 --> 11:40.534
as an assistant.

I was ambitious, but I had
no idea how I might progress.

Family is important.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.645
He has guided us through

He encouraged us,

My boat-train's at 11:00.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.889
I've got a cab waiting.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.309
On, Kitty...

14:16.981 --> 14:19.029
A marriage that spans
an ocean.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.072
It's very modern,
I suppose.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.708
"And absence may,"
as the saying goes...

14:27.867 --> 14:29.335
Absence won't heal
your marriage, Frank.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.589
You'd be a fool
to think that.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.670
I've been in your shoes,

14:34.832 --> 14:36.630
lost years
with the woman I loved.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.512
Life is short.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.468
This is your last chance
to make it right.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.679
You let her go,
you may not see her again.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.434
My job is here.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.641
Wynnstay's on our back
with this damned writ.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.226
To hell with Wynnstay.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.517
We've worked together
a long time, Frank.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.275
You've saved my bacon more times
than I can count.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.107
Jobs come and go.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.145
Love doesn't have to.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.657
♪♪

15:27.093 --> 15:27.969
Kitty!

15:31.597 --> 15:32.894
Don't go.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.402
I'm not going
through this again.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.234
What you did, it doesn't heal
overnight, Frank.

15:38.396 --> 15:41.115
It takes time.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.072
Time and distance.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.611
Wait, please,
for pity's sake.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.246
If you walk out that door,

15:47.405 --> 15:49.282
I'm scared
I'll never see you again.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.372
Please listen.

15:51.534 --> 15:55.004
I want our marriage back,
whatever it takes.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.335
I have to go.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.469
Let me come with you.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.136
What?

16:08.426 --> 16:09.769
To New York.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.895
Now. Tonight.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.183
Start a new life,
just the two of us.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.353
What about your job here?

16:18.519 --> 16:21.898
Harry's given me his blessing.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.284
So... what do you say?

16:29.113 --> 16:30.330
You haven't packed.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.381
That was rather short-sighted
of you, Frank.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.587
I didn't want to presume.

17:13.866 --> 17:14.742
To New York!

17:14.909 --> 17:15.785
(laughing)

17:39.100 --> 17:40.147
Hello, Mae.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.185
On your urging,

17:41.352 --> 17:42.353
I talk to the press

17:42.520 --> 17:44.318
and all they want
to talk about is this...

17:44.480 --> 17:45.322
<i>The London Herald.</i>

17:45.481 --> 17:47.074
"Provincial stores
sell off.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.450
Selfridge's in trouble."

17:48.609 --> 17:50.077
What's Wynnstay
playing at?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.408
Frank needs
to sort this out.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.665
Frank's gone.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.167
He left for America with Kitty
last night.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.413
Right, what do you want me
to say, then?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.002
"No comment."

18:02.164 --> 18:03.586
Tell them to move on.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.890
This is because of the writ,
isn't it?

18:11.048 --> 18:12.595
It could be months
before we get to trial,

18:12.758 --> 18:13.725
months of stories like this.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.388
Normally, Frank
would sort this out.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.726
Would you be willing
to call a truce'?

18:21.892 --> 18:24.020
Restore the advertising
in Wynnstay's papers.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.115
I would,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.527
but it's personal now.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.663
Wynnstay's set against me.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.495
He has no gripe with me.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.536
If I sent you, he would take it
as a sign of weakness

18:39.702 --> 18:41.670
and he'll think that
he's got me on the run.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.503
Perhaps that's a good thing.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.967
(seagulls calling)

18:55.176 --> 18:57.520
GROVE:
That is a beauty.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.442
That's not for the collection.

19:03.601 --> 19:07.071
That, my dear, is for you.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.323
I've married a romantic.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.577
Thank you.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.157
I love it.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.699
Do you know something?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.960
I'm not afraid anymore.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.167
With you by my side,
I feel that what will come...

19:24.330 --> 19:26.207
Will come.

19:26.374 --> 19:31.972
And until it does,
I shall live my life as normal.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.928
My work, my family...

19:35.091 --> 19:38.721
Ah, you wish to return
to your old post.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.809
Mmm.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.848
(laughs)

19:47.353 --> 19:49.401
Do you know, I was rather
afraid of your children,

19:49.563 --> 19:52.032
but I have to confess,
lam rather missing them.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.613
They adore you.

19:53.776 --> 19:54.902
Even Meryl?

19:55.069 --> 19:56.116
Even Meryl.

19:57.905 --> 19:58.781
(screams)

20:05.746 --> 20:06.793
(angrily):
Just great!

20:06.956 --> 20:07.832
I'm so sorry.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.545
It's easily fixed.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.086
Sorry, where do you work?

20:11.252 --> 20:12.378
Fashion.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.422
Oh, perhaps I'll just knock over
a few dress racks.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.840
Easily fixed.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.758
I didn't mean to do it!

20:17.925 --> 20:19.598
Well, you were wandering along
like a rummy.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.932
I beg your pardon!

20:23.973 --> 20:26.317
What gives you the right
to be so rude?

20:32.940 --> 20:33.816
I'm sorry.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.583
Where is everyone?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.494
A welcome lunch
for the new machinists.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.960
Why have you got
all this work?

20:49.123 --> 20:50.670
From when I worked
on Miss Mardle's dress.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.296
That isn't fair.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.635
At all.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.891
Forget I said anything.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.097
Meryl, I need to get on.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.933
I don't want to give them
any excuse.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.598
Excuse for what?

21:05.765 --> 21:06.641
Just go.

21:23.866 --> 21:24.742
Lord Wynnstay.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.713
My father sends
his apologies.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.677
We would like you to drop
your writ against us.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.638
In exchange,
we will continue

21:41.801 --> 21:43.223
to place advertisements
in your papers

21:43.385 --> 21:44.386
as per our contract,

21:44.553 --> 21:46.055
which we intend
to honor in full.

21:46.222 --> 21:51.649
Your father said I'd never see
another penny from Selfridge's.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.028
<i>Passions have coded.</i>

21:55.356 --> 21:58.701
You tell your father,
messenger boy,

21:58.859 --> 22:00.657
I will not drop my writ.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.788
I shall see him in court.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.710
I thought you might
say that.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.122
Our counsel feels this is
a more than fair settlement.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.727
You're young.

22:25.886 --> 22:30.266
I expect you think
everything has a price.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.561
I wonder what your board
would make of this:

22:33.727 --> 22:39.109
you turning down such a sum
on account of a petty grudge.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.573
They are sure to hear
about it.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.988
You do not own all the press,

22:44.154 --> 22:45.997
Lord Wynnstay.

22:48.158 --> 22:51.082
The Selfridge pup has teeth.

22:56.417 --> 22:57.293
(grunts)

23:05.050 --> 23:06.723
(exhales)

23:06.886 --> 23:08.263
(knocking)

23:09.471 --> 23:10.563
How are you, Harry?

23:10.723 --> 23:11.599
Jimmy!

23:11.765 --> 23:13.358
Where have you been hiding?

23:13.517 --> 23:14.393
With my mother.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.812
She's not been too well.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.104
Oh, I'm sorry to hear
about that.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.488
No, no, no, she's better now.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.867
Can I just say the store
is looking absolutely fantastic?

23:22.026 --> 23:22.902
It is.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.365
"Summer at Selfridge's."

23:24.528 --> 23:25.575
Magnificent.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.160
We're back on form.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.041
We should team up again, Harry.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.369
What do you say?

23:34.288 --> 23:36.290
Easy money out there
for men like you and me.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.380
I'm gonna have to take
a pass on this one.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.010
Can't take my eyes
off the ball again.

23:40.169 --> 23:43.013
Almost lost everything--
my store, my family.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.674
I would have, if not for you.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.969
I hope you
understand, Jimmy.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.103
So, we'll work together
again, I promise,

23:50.262 --> 23:51.138
on the right project.

23:51.305 --> 23:52.477
My door's always open to you.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.562
Thank you.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.437
So first,
you were a showgirl,

23:58.604 --> 24:00.698
then a Lady of the Realm,

24:00.856 --> 24:02.449
head of a Parisian
fashion house,

24:02.608 --> 24:05.077
and now designer
at Selfridge's.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.408
My goodness, you have
done your homework.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.118
(elevator bell dings)

24:09.281 --> 24:11.625
MAE:
Ah.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.754
I'm sorry, could you excuse me
just a moment?

24:16.538 --> 24:18.040
Jimmy.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.714
It's been awhile.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.220
Yes, I know.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.256
My mother was ill.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.719
Ah.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.225
I did wonder
where you'd been.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.978
I was sorry to hear
about Victor.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.012
Thank you.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.641
He was an old friend.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.606
It was a terrible shock.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.030
I suppose it was.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.447
I'm very sorry.

24:45.609 --> 24:49.239
I should let you
get back.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.907
Goodbye, Mae.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.382
Madame Rennard,

25:04.545 --> 25:06.468
I wonder if we might
go over these figures?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.132
Of course, Mr. Crabb.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.766
Madame Rennard, can you sign off
on these order sheets?

25:09.925 --> 25:10.801
I'm concerned
about the effect

25:10.968 --> 25:12.891
of all these additional
machinists.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.976
I'm concerned about feeding
customer demand, Mr. Crabb.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.356
MISS ELLIS:
You missed one.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.267
Mae, did you manage
to speak to the press?

25:18.434 --> 25:20.277
Oh, will you all just
go away?!

25:25.399 --> 25:27.117
That was unforgivable, Harry.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.152
I apologize.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.405
Don't.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.244
My head's in a whirl.

25:38.829 --> 25:39.705
Victor?

25:45.502 --> 25:47.129
Victor burned bright and fast.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.515
Fought in the war,
achieved in business.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.674
A full life.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.393
In a funny sort of way, my life
and Victor's were quite similar.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.734
He had no partner,
no children,

26:04.897 --> 26:07.275
buried himself in his work...

26:07.441 --> 26:09.944
You're not Victor.

26:10.110 --> 26:14.160
I will die alone.

26:14.323 --> 26:19.329
This collection,
I've thrown myself at it and...

26:19.495 --> 26:21.418
it's worked,
it's been a success.

26:24.291 --> 26:29.548
I just feel so... empty.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.143
We're having
a family dinner tonight.

26:35.302 --> 26:36.554
I want you to come.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.313
That's a lovely thought, Harry,

26:38.472 --> 26:40.065
but I would be
awful company.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.396
(laughs)

26:41.558 --> 26:44.402
Even at your lowest,
you still light up the room.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.687
Come on.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.528
I'm not going to take
no for an answer.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.453
Oh, now this was from Hythe.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.786
Oh, and this was from Dymchurch,
or was it Botany Bay?

26:56.949 --> 26:57.996
(grunts)

26:58.158 --> 26:59.000
Did you swim?

26:59.159 --> 27:00.206
Oh, yes.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.918
Every evening,
in the warm bath of my cottage.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.502
(door opens)

27:04.665 --> 27:05.382
Oh, hello.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.417
Oh!

27:06.583 --> 27:07.550
Welcome back.

27:09.086 --> 27:09.962
How are things at the store?

27:10.129 --> 27:11.676
Very busy.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.847
Meryl, perhaps we could have tea
one day next week.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.558
When you have
your break.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.812
Oh, that's a fine idea.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.474
You could catch up
on all store goings-on.

27:23.559 --> 27:27.029
Father, can I ask you something?

27:27.187 --> 27:30.657
But she's being singled out,
loaded down with work.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.865
Miss Brockless should bring
the matter to me herself.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.950
She doesn't want to make a fuss.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.036
If those are her wishes,
you should abide by them.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.121
I don't want my first day
back at work

27:40.284 --> 27:42.002
to be taken up
by a petty squabble.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.914
This all started because she
worked on Josie's wedding dress.

27:45.080 --> 27:49.381
So in a way, you're morally
obliged to help.

27:52.421 --> 27:53.297
Very well.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.437
ROSALIE: Mae, you must be thinking
of your autumn collection.

28:00.596 --> 28:01.563
MAE:
Mm!

28:01.722 --> 28:04.942
Brown gabardine cloaks
and sackcloth wraps.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.569
(laughter)

28:07.728 --> 28:12.609
I've certainly learned that
one good idea is not enough.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.118
You have to have several,
and for every new season.

28:15.277 --> 28:16.494
I don't know how you do it,
Harry.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.623
I have a great team around me,
the best in the business.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.538
That's how you build
a lasting enterprise.

28:25.078 --> 28:28.207
I've made many mistakes,
tragic mistakes.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.375
But the best decision
I ever made

28:30.542 --> 28:32.044
was bringing Gordon
back into the store.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.222
He's steadied the ship.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.508
I don't want to let you go,
so I've created

28:37.674 --> 28:39.551
a new position for you.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.346
Managing Director
at Selfridge's, Oxford Street.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.765
(women gasp)

28:47.768 --> 28:49.315
Here's to you, Gordon.

28:49.478 --> 28:50.445
GRACE:
To Gordon.

28:50.604 --> 28:51.400
Wow.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.689
Congratulations.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.358
Thank you!

28:54.524 --> 28:56.117
Cheers, I suppose!

29:00.530 --> 29:01.747
Roly.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.375
Jimmy.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.126
No, no, no,
don't get up.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.419
You might want to tell me
next time you disappear.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.584
I've had to turn away reams
of perfectly good business.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.049
Are you quite all right?

29:15.212 --> 29:17.431
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.806
What have you got?

29:18.966 --> 29:20.183
(chuckling)

29:20.342 --> 29:21.969
Jimmy wants a project.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.682
If you're ambitious,

29:23.845 --> 29:26.473
and I think you are,
oil's the next step.

29:27.766 --> 29:28.983
Bring me something big.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.361
Bricks and mortar.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.898
Maybe I do have something
for you.

29:34.064 --> 29:37.193
Very long-term.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.987
You can't be alone
on this one, Jimmy.

29:40.153 --> 29:41.655
You'd need a team around you.

29:41.822 --> 29:42.744
Proper experts.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.244
You've got my attention.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.418
Thank you.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.174
Mr. Grove.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.213
Morning.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.809
Lovely to see you,
Mr. Grove.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.515
How was your honeymoon?

30:04.678 --> 30:06.430
Wonderful, thank you,
Miss Plunkett.

30:06.596 --> 30:07.472
Good to be back.

30:09.725 --> 30:10.851
There's plenty to do.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.275
Right.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.283
(groans)

30:26.450 --> 30:29.670
PRU: 
Follow each pattern 
exactly, okay?

30:29.828 --> 30:30.750
Everyone understand?

30:30.912 --> 30:32.129
Follow me.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.165
Go!

30:38.670 --> 30:40.092
Make sure the new ones
are up to speed.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.507
They're a gobby lot.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.267
A few of them came
from Corley's.

30:44.426 --> 30:45.552
You used to work
at Corley's,

30:45.719 --> 30:46.595
didn't you, Tilly?

30:49.014 --> 30:49.936
Yes.

31:02.736 --> 31:03.612
Hello.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.281
Oh. Hello.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.292
Perhaps I was a little hasty
in assigning blame

31:09.451 --> 31:11.624
for your little mishap
the other day.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.710
I'd just like
to apologize.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.748
Again?

31:16.750 --> 31:18.502
Oh, you heard me?

31:18.668 --> 31:20.841
Sorry, I wasn't sure.

31:21.004 --> 31:24.759
Perhaps because you muttered it
so grudgingly.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.855
Do you talk to your
customers like this?

31:31.014 --> 31:34.018
Thankfully, none of them
resemble you, Mr. Lyons.

31:34.184 --> 31:36.937
Now, I'm very busy,
so I'll say good day.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.157
(door straining)

31:44.319 --> 31:46.492
Oh, that's locked.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.076
It's a cupboard.

31:54.037 --> 31:59.339
I was wondering how your new
machinists are settling in.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.128
Very well, Mr. Grove.

32:01.294 --> 32:04.298
We're slowly making a dent
in the orders.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.182
Excellent.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.439
One of your machinists--

32:12.597 --> 32:16.818
Miss Brockless--

32:16.977 --> 32:19.605
I have been led to believe

32:19.771 --> 32:23.446
has been carrying
an excessive workload of late.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.660
What do you say about that?

32:28.822 --> 32:32.952
Miss Brockless hasn't kept pace
with the other girls.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.712
Matter of fact,

32:35.871 --> 32:38.715
one of our new machinists
worked with her at Corley's.

32:38.874 --> 32:42.253
From what I hear,
she was lucky to get this job.

32:42.419 --> 32:45.889
Miss Brockless did have
the correct references,

32:46.047 --> 32:48.891
didn't she, Mr. Grove?

32:50.135 --> 32:51.387
All right.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.055
Thank you.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.019
You may go, Miss Ellis.

33:01.021 --> 33:01.817
(knocking)

33:05.859 --> 33:07.111
Our new Managing Director!

33:07.277 --> 33:08.620
How does it feel?

33:09.863 --> 33:10.910
Exciting.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.244
Challenging.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.705
Intimidating.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.838
No more so than
stepping in the ring

33:17.996 --> 33:19.168
with someone like Wynnstay.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.379
I couldn't have handled that one
better myself.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.635
Well, I hope to do you proud.

33:23.793 --> 33:24.965
You already have.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.425
(knocking)

33:28.006 --> 33:29.508
You said come back in
with the right project, Harry.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.550
Here it is.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.719
I can go,
if you'd like.

33:32.886 --> 33:33.762
No, no, no.

33:33.929 --> 33:34.680
Stay-

33:37.641 --> 33:39.234
Right.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.446
We should do this more often,
you know, just the two of us.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.403
I rather like
coming into town.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.441
I miss it.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.445
Meryl, is everything all right?

33:55.408 --> 33:56.660
The head of display.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.124
Mr. Lyons.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.085
He's possibly the rudest,
strangest man

34:01.248 --> 34:02.670
I've ever met in my life.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.927
After apologizing once,
he seeks me out

34:06.086 --> 34:08.804
the very next day
to apologize again.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.851
My dear Meryl.

34:14.010 --> 34:18.891
Have you ever considered
that he may be soft on you?

34:19.056 --> 34:21.400
Well, what sense
does that make,

34:21.560 --> 34:23.358
approaching it
like that?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.362
Well, your first mistake
is assuming sense

34:25.522 --> 34:27.149
is involved at all.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.279
(whistles)

34:33.487 --> 34:35.034
Whiteley's?

34:36.866 --> 34:38.288
Steel frame structure.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.998
Portland stone.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.333
Medallion cornice,
bronze balconies,

34:42.496 --> 34:43.668
fluted Doric columns.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.550
But it's losing money
hand over fist.

34:45.708 --> 34:49.429
Now, people in the know tell me
the Whiteley Brothers

34:49.588 --> 34:50.760
are way out of their depth.

34:50.922 --> 34:55.723
Word is, they're running
out of cash and want out.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.388
Is it for sale?

34:58.555 --> 35:01.479
We just sold several
department stores.

35:01.641 --> 35:02.437
Now we buy one?

35:02.601 --> 35:03.568
No, no, no, Gordon.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.446
This isn't just
a department store;

35:06.605 --> 35:09.233
it is a landmark
family business.

35:09.399 --> 35:11.151
Like Selfridge's.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.070
Except it's in Bayswater.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.658
Not exactly thriving.

35:14.821 --> 35:17.620
And Selfridge's was at
the wrong end of Oxford Street.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.877
Come on, Harry,
that's what they said,

35:21.036 --> 35:24.882
and you proved them wrong.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.792
A mile of windows
in central London.

35:29.085 --> 35:32.464
Two flagship stores.

35:32.631 --> 35:33.883
And a big commission for you,
Jimmy?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.430
I'm not bringing this to you
as a broker.

35:36.593 --> 35:39.096
I want to be part of it.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.185
50/50 equity partner.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.570
Didn't know retail
was your game.

35:46.728 --> 35:50.403
It's not, and that's why
I'm coming to you.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.784
You and your father are
without doubt

35:52.942 --> 35:54.819
the best in the business.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.533
I'm telling you,
if there's anyone

35:56.696 --> 36:00.746
that can turn this place around,
it's you.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.004
What do you think, Pa?

36:04.162 --> 36:05.789
It's a big job.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.464
What do you think?

36:20.929 --> 36:23.728
We could do this.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.517
HARRY:
(laughs)

36:25.684 --> 36:28.107
Jimmy's right.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.942
If anyone can do it,
we can.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.577
(knocking)

36:40.740 --> 36:41.616
Come.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.884
Miss Brockless,

36:55.046 --> 36:58.641
it has been brought
to my attention

36:58.800 --> 37:01.098
that you are not entirely
up front

37:01.261 --> 37:03.309
about your previous
employment.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.725
As you came to us without
a reference from Corley's,

37:06.891 --> 37:09.189
I felt compelled to investigate.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.446
I spoke
to the foreman there,

37:11.604 --> 37:14.357
<i>a Mr. Such.</i>

37:14.524 --> 37:17.653
You mustn't believe
a single word that man says.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.282
Sorry.

37:22.449 --> 37:28.456
Mr. Sitch led me to believe
that you left Corley's

37:28.621 --> 37:30.669
under a cloud of scandal,

37:30.832 --> 37:33.881
amid allegations
of dishonesty.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.011
Would you tell me about that,
Miss Brockless?

37:37.797 --> 37:41.051
I'm a good worker,
Mr. Grove.

37:41.217 --> 37:43.140
What happened at Corley's?

37:43.303 --> 37:46.477
You won't believe me.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.768
Miss Brockless,
if you are honest with me,

37:49.934 --> 37:52.528
honest and thorough

37:52.687 --> 37:55.065
in your explanation
of what happened,

37:55.231 --> 37:58.201
maybe we could come
to an accommodation.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.663
I can't tell you.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.454
Then you know I have no choice.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.846
Your references,

38:23.009 --> 38:24.477
and two weeks' pay.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.854
That will be all,
Miss Brockless.

38:48.368 --> 38:49.085
Just follow my lead.

38:49.244 --> 38:49.915
(knocking)

38:50.078 --> 38:52.172
It's William
and Frank Whiteley.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.633
Ah, William.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.007
Frank.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.390
My son Gordon.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.767
Gordon.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.599
Of course you know
Jimmy Dillon.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.729
He'll be partnering with us
on this deal.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.061
Still flying on Mr. Selfridge's
coattails, I see, Jimmy.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.441
I only work with the best.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.523
So does Mr. Selfridge.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.687
Shall we get on with it?

39:20.567 --> 39:21.614
Before we start,

39:21.776 --> 39:23.244
you should know we've had
another offer.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.780
A very good offer.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.493
HARRY:
For another retailer?

39:26.656 --> 39:27.782
Because there's none better
than me.

39:27.949 --> 39:28.666
A developer.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.202
And what do they intend
to do with it?

39:30.368 --> 39:30.960
Housing.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.375
All your father's work,

39:33.538 --> 39:34.414
turned to dust?

39:34.581 --> 39:36.379
Our father's gone.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.293
We've got to do
what's best for us now.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.585
One day,

39:39.752 --> 39:41.754
you'll be
in our shoes.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.764
GORDON:
(scoffs)

39:43.923 --> 39:45.925
I'd never send a wrecking ball
into Selfridge's.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.477
Right, let's discuss a price.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.353
What's your offer?

40:13.828 --> 40:15.421
You're going to have to do
better than that.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.298
Gentlemen.

40:21.461 --> 40:22.758
Excuse us.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.134
(door opens)

40:31.220 --> 40:33.097
How much more
do you think we need?

40:33.264 --> 40:35.517
No more than £300,000.

40:38.728 --> 40:39.604
You all in, Jimmy?

40:44.192 --> 40:45.489
What about the money leftover

40:45.652 --> 40:46.744
from the sale
of the provincial stores?

40:46.903 --> 40:49.702
That might
just be enough.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.834
That's all our liquidity.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.290
No more safety net,
no margin for error.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.877
Isn't that how all great
enterprises begin?

41:03.795 --> 41:05.638
Let's make this deal.

41:07.757 --> 41:08.804
(knocking)

41:08.967 --> 41:10.014
Yes?

41:13.638 --> 41:15.015
Josie!

41:15.181 --> 41:16.478
I wasn't expecting you.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.517
I met Meryl for tea.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.560
There we go.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.020
Oh, I'm glad.

41:24.774 --> 41:25.946
Ooh.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.827
Oh, I say,
thank you.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.331
Is your return
not <i>as</i> you'd hoped?

41:37.078 --> 41:42.300
I'm not sure I can give this job
what I used to.

41:42.458 --> 41:48.511
Whatever decision you make,
Roger, I will support you.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.886
Then I think...

41:54.679 --> 41:56.226
...l shall retire.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.315
There.

42:06.482 --> 42:11.864
I shall tell the chief
when I find the right moment.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.283
Then that's that.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.754
Mae?

42:23.916 --> 42:25.714
Oh, whatever's happened?

42:25.877 --> 42:27.299
Something unexpected.

42:27.462 --> 42:29.760
Something wonderful.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.048
Oh, well, tell me!

42:31.215 --> 42:32.558
Whiteley's.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.560
We just bought Whiteley's.

42:34.719 --> 42:35.766
(laughs)

42:35.928 --> 42:38.022
Oh, well, that is incredible!

42:38.181 --> 42:39.182
Jimmy, Gordon, and I,

42:39.348 --> 42:40.691
we just shook hands
on a price.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.193
It's an icon,

42:42.351 --> 42:44.900
a London landmark,
and it's all ours.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.191
And we're going to fill it
with your range.

42:47.356 --> 42:50.735
Madame Rennard's scarves,
hats, lingerie...

42:50.902 --> 42:52.279
I haven't felt this happy

42:52.445 --> 42:54.698
since Selfridge's was
a muddy hole in the ground.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.662
Well, welcome back,
mile-a-minute Harry.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.701
I've really missed you.

42:58.868 --> 43:01.587
You're the first person
I wanted to tell.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.714
I just wanted to see
the look on your face.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.671
Oh, gosh.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.631
And after all that talk
of consolidation.

43:07.794 --> 43:10.764
You know me better
than I know myself.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.970
I've always believed in you.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.180
From the moment
I first set eyes on you.

43:17.011 --> 43:19.685
Why'd I ever
let you go to Paris?

43:19.847 --> 43:21.269
(footsteps)

43:21.432 --> 43:23.059
Pa?

43:24.727 --> 43:27.401
Gordon, your father has just
told me about Whiteley's.

43:27.563 --> 43:28.439
Congratulations.

43:30.399 --> 43:34.529
It'll be a challenge,
but I think we can make it work.

43:34.695 --> 43:35.912
Jimmy needs us.

43:36.072 --> 43:38.200
Yes, well,
I'm so happy for you, Harry.

43:38.366 --> 43:39.242
Thank you.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.169
Excuse us.

44:09.772 --> 44:10.819
Good morning,
Mr. Selfridge.

44:10.982 --> 44:11.858
Hi.

44:14.402 --> 44:15.278
So...

44:15.444 --> 44:16.491
All right?

44:16.654 --> 44:17.530
Oh, yes.

44:39.093 --> 44:41.016
<i>IA'</i>

44:50.855 --> 44:52.357
What a sight.

44:52.523 --> 44:53.740
It's beautiful.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.117
A palace.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.102
Evening, boss.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.312
Tooby, this better be good.

45:27.475 --> 45:30.069
Victor Colleano,
the vaudeville impresario.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.480
Died a few weeks back.

45:31.646 --> 45:32.943
The police tried to link it

45:33.105 --> 45:34.948
to some underworld
associates of his.

45:35.107 --> 45:37.576
The investigation's
hit a brick wall.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.658
Well, that's not much
of a story, is it?

45:39.820 --> 45:42.573
I think they've been looking
in the wrong place.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.242
This fellow Colleano

45:44.408 --> 45:48.288
mixed with some very
interesting people.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.512
Very interesting.

46:00.675 --> 46:02.177
Would you like me
to dig, boss?

46:03.970 --> 46:05.062
Please.
