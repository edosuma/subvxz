WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:02.419
(siren blaring)

00:02.502 --> 00:04.879
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:04.963 --> 00:06.131
Rosa Lombardy.

00:06.381 --> 00:09.217
Her name in Christ, Sister Anna Carmel.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.595
Raped, beaten with fists
and blunt instrument. Mutilated.

00:12.679 --> 00:17.058
(people shouting)

00:17.475 --> 00:18.977
MAN: Get me out of here!

00:19.060 --> 00:20.562
(overlapping dialog)

00:20.937 --> 00:22.063
You guys did it.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.940
I'll shut up and wait
till my mouth get here.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.650
FURILLO: Take your time, Sister.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.193
I don't know.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.571
You will be signing a death warrant.

00:29.904 --> 00:30.947
Call the judge.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.118
(indistinct chattering)

00:35.201 --> 00:37.120
ESTERHAUS: Item Seven. Stakeouts.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.207
(whispering)

00:42.876 --> 00:44.544
As I was saying, Item Seven.

00:44.627 --> 00:47.714
Stakeouts continuing
are Hertle Avenue Market,

00:48.173 --> 00:51.593
Ten Planets Video Arcade
opposite Massey High School,

00:52.135 --> 00:54.554
and in concert with our brothers
from the Treasury Department,

00:54.637 --> 00:57.307
Ramirez Check Cash, 140th and North.

00:57.932 --> 01:01.061
We also begin an operation
at the Allen Street bus terminal

01:01.728 --> 01:05.940
concerning the commercial activities
of, uh, gay gentlemen of pleasure

01:06.024 --> 01:07.192
in the depot men's room.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.153
(laughter)

01:10.403 --> 01:14.115
In this regard, I call to your attention
the currently voguish brown-bag maneuver,

01:14.199 --> 01:17.410
in which one of two caballeros
sharing a men's room stall

01:17.494 --> 01:20.872
-stands with his feet in a shopping bag...
-(laughter)

01:20.955 --> 01:23.625
...thus convincing passing
law enforcement agents

01:23.708 --> 01:26.961
the, uh, stall has only a single
and legitimate tenant.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.797
(laughter)

01:28.880 --> 01:31.091
Would that we could address
our problems of urban blight

01:31.549 --> 01:35.428
and inflation as resourcefully
as we satisfy our passions.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.764
(laughter)

01:37.847 --> 01:39.307
Item Eight.

01:39.390 --> 01:43.311
For those of you double-shifted
at the Dee Dee Cleveland concert

01:43.394 --> 01:46.981
at Memorial Auditorium tonight
are listed on the upstairs board.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.819
Be aware that for reasons unknown,
vandalism and theft,

01:50.902 --> 01:53.822
among those leaving
Ms. Cleveland's concert in the past,

01:54.114 --> 01:56.116
have tended to focus on shoe stores,

01:56.741 --> 01:59.702
especially those dealing
in, uh, your more exotic

01:59.786 --> 02:02.831
and reptilian styles
of contemporary footwear.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.958
(chattering)

02:05.041 --> 02:06.584
Alligator, lizards.

02:06.668 --> 02:10.797
-Item Nine is a memo from Chief Daniels...
-(all moan)

02:10.880 --> 02:16.094
...regarding profanity in our dealings
with the civilian populace,

02:16.469 --> 02:19.013
which memo is also posted
on the upstairs board.

02:20.014 --> 02:23.560
People, I recognize downtown's tendency
to be unrealistic in these matters,

02:23.643 --> 02:27.397
but consider a complaint I took yesterday
from an elderly woman

02:27.480 --> 02:28.565
who had been rendered assistance

02:28.648 --> 02:31.234
with a stolen vehicle
by one of our uniforms.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.571
Here was one of our own, going the
extra mile in the performance of his duty,

02:34.654 --> 02:37.407
yet he was so accustomed
to certain patterns of speech,

02:37.490 --> 02:38.867
that in arriving at the scene,

02:38.950 --> 02:41.911
he cheerfully inquired (chuckles),
and I quote,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.872
"So, what the bleep's wrong
with your car, ma'am?"

02:43.955 --> 02:45.498
(laughter)

02:46.207 --> 02:49.919
Said bleep allegedly causing complainant
a severe episode of migraine.

02:50.712 --> 02:54.132
Now, I've assembled some terms
you might try substituting

02:54.215 --> 02:58.219
for the swear words in question
as you move through your daily routine.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.097
Now, they won't come trippingly
to your tongue at first,

03:01.181 --> 03:05.310
but with time and usage, you could find
them becoming second nature.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.021
Your recourse to obscenity
will then be fresh and vital

03:08.104 --> 03:10.899
when you encounter
those situations and individuals

03:10.982 --> 03:14.194
-for whom only obscenity will suffice.
-(chuckles)

03:14.277 --> 03:18.323
Now, the officer in question
could have used the word "heck."

03:18.406 --> 03:21.409
(laughter)

03:21.492 --> 03:24.120
Other more suitable terms,
drat, shoot, fudge...

03:24.204 --> 03:26.456
(laughter)

03:26.539 --> 03:28.416
...instead of the more common expletive

03:28.499 --> 03:31.294
usually associated
with your street patois.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.838
-Fudge patois. (laughs)
-Yeah, fudge patois.

03:34.505 --> 03:38.509
Item last. Starting today,
and continuing for the next six weeks,

03:38.593 --> 03:42.764
Sergeant Esterhaus will not be supervising
the activities of the front desk.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.810
He will instead be conducting
an experimental,

03:47.894 --> 03:51.648
six-week orientation class
for senior cadets at the police academy.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.276
(cheering)

03:55.360 --> 03:57.820
In his absence, his duties upstairs
will be divided between

03:57.904 --> 04:00.615
Officer Schnitz and Sergeant Goldblume.

04:01.241 --> 04:05.286
I will, however, continue to deliver
the morning roll call.

04:05.370 --> 04:09.457
(cheering)

04:09.540 --> 04:11.042
That's it. Let's roll!

04:11.584 --> 04:14.087
And, hey, let's be careful out there.

04:15.129 --> 04:20.677
And, people, let's show a little restraint
in defacing the chief's memo.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.433
BATES: God, it's hot!

04:27.767 --> 04:29.435
You know, I could rub
ice cubes all over you.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.022
It's not enough they issue a new procedure
every goldarned week,

04:33.106 --> 04:36.359
it's not enough that we're up to the seat
of our pants in policy,

04:36.442 --> 04:38.903
in everything from personal hygiene
to choke holds.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.321
-Will you get out of my way!
-Excuse me!

04:40.405 --> 04:43.533
Please. Now, they're trying
to regulate my expression!

04:43.616 --> 04:45.743
-Tell 'em to fudge off.
-Morning, Lieutenant.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.287
That's easy for you to say.

04:47.370 --> 04:51.624
Bates, Coffey, robbery-shooting.
A bodega at 4139 Jefferson.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.627
Hill, Renko. Domestic beef.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.297
9260 106th Street, apartment five.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.173
-Let's go! You'll have to wait.
-Now?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.758
They're not going
to regulate my facilities.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.677
-Hygiene.
-Ah, your facilities!

05:03.011 --> 05:05.346
Don't look at me like that,
sweet-face boy.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.440
-Use it!
-Why are we so stern?

05:23.281 --> 05:25.616
-Last name first.
-DuBois.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.127
-First name?
-Blanche.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.590
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:40.673 --> 05:42.383
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:42.467 --> 05:46.220
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:46.304 --> 05:47.930
(sirens wailing)

05:53.394 --> 05:57.315
(theme music playing)

07:32.118 --> 07:34.036
Somebody's trade got a little rough, huh?

07:34.495 --> 07:36.622
Some of us know how to incite passion.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.003
Can't you change that
to lascivious carriage?

07:42.086 --> 07:43.337
It's a tonier kind of bust.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.339
You were soliciting, pit breath.

07:45.756 --> 07:48.259
I've never tricked for anyone
I wouldn't have done gratis.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.094
(phone rings)

07:53.097 --> 07:55.308
-Belker.
<i>-Mickey, it's Mom.</i>

07:55.391 --> 07:59.187
-Hi, Ma.
-(Rose talking indistinctly)

07:59.270 --> 08:01.189
Ma, come on.
So what if he was on the lawn?

08:01.272 --> 08:02.607
He likes the fresh air.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.736
-Well, it's warm, see?
-(talking indistinctly)

08:06.819 --> 08:09.238
Okay, so he forgot to put 'em on.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.033
Next time you'll lay 'em out
where he can see 'em better.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.995
-He did what?
<i>-He peed on the oak tree.</i>

08:16.078 --> 08:18.498
-No, he didn't!
<i>-Yes, he did.</i>

08:18.581 --> 08:20.166
On Mrs. Caridi's oak tree?

08:22.585 --> 08:24.795
-He was sleepwalking.
<i>-He's senile.</i>

08:24.879 --> 08:27.590
Don't say that. Don't use that word!

08:27.673 --> 08:30.593
He was sleepwalking and he had
to make water and that's all.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.139
He does not think he's a dog.
That's probably a deep cough.

08:36.557 --> 08:40.228
I'm not going to-- We are not going to
speak if you continue to say that word.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.188
<i>Senile, senile, senile!</i>

08:42.271 --> 08:45.024
I'll talk to you later.
I will call you later on.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.484
Give my love to Pop.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.779
So, feed him!

08:50.780 --> 08:52.448
Put it down there for him.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.744
-How old is he?
-None of your business.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.415
He's 82.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.752
Senility is nothing to be ashamed of,
you know.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.170
He is not senile.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.339
-It's part of life.
-Will you button it?

09:08.422 --> 09:11.717
My grandmother was senile.
She had such fun on her birthdays.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.387
She'd open her present, then drift off.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.014
Then look down, see her present,
and get happy all over again.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.560
That's what my father does
with his breakfast cereal.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.564
Frank. Frank.

09:24.855 --> 09:28.526
I have a tax audit this afternoon.
The IRS has called me.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.987
-Receipts?
-Yes.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.780
Frank, I'm really worried.

09:33.447 --> 09:37.076
Rosa's sister bought us a lottery ticket
in New Hampshire last summer.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.830
We won 2,500 dollars.
Now she won't talk to us.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.206
And you didn't report the income.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.917
The man at the service said
they'd never check.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.503
And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.340
He said deduct a portion of our rent.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.177
He said don't declare
what Rosa made selling dress patterns.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.347
Is he going to go with you to the audit?
That's what they advertise.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.434
Their office says
they are trying to find him.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.854
-Morning, Frank, Ray.
-BOTH: Morning.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.152
-I have a tax audit this afternoon.
-It's probably just routine.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.279
Oh.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.783
-Iverson got 18 months.
-Who is Iverson?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.161
He didn't file a return
for seven years, Howard.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.706
-Who is Iverson?
-He's a lieutenant, Midtown.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.417
They let him do his time on the weekends.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.106
All right! I cheated with Rudy.
I'm that way!

10:49.190 --> 10:52.401
I'm a creature of passion.
But am I worth going to prison for?

10:52.485 --> 10:56.447
(shouting)

10:56.530 --> 10:58.324
-Rudy! Rudy!
-Stop it!

10:58.407 --> 11:01.243
It's the police, Carl!
Do you want them to shoot you down?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.496
-Like a dirty dog because of me?
-Nobody's going to be shot, ma'am.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.873
-Just tone down your language.
-RUDY: Oh, is it the police?

11:05.956 --> 11:08.542
-Yes, sir. It is the police.
-(groans)

11:08.626 --> 11:12.213
Oh, my goodness!
Uh, sir, just take it easy, okay?

11:12.296 --> 11:15.174
RUDY: Oh, my head's stuck!
Get me out of here!

11:15.257 --> 11:16.967
Now, Carl, give me that hammer.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.054
(Rudy sobs) Ow! He's stepping on my hand!

11:20.137 --> 11:22.139
Get off his hand, Carl.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.476
Now, will everybody please take a minute

11:25.559 --> 11:28.479
and tell me what it is
that is happening here.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.399
I came home to find my wife,
that slut there,

11:31.482 --> 11:33.943
in my bed with my former
best friend, Rudy,

11:34.026 --> 11:35.736
who I'm going to bust up real bad!

11:35.820 --> 11:37.488
-(screams)
-(gasps)

11:37.571 --> 11:38.989
Give me the hammer, Carl!

11:39.073 --> 11:41.367
You haven't hurt anybody yet.
Now, come on!

11:41.742 --> 11:44.370
Now, cousin, can you tell me how it is

11:44.453 --> 11:47.581
that you happened to get
your melon, uh, wedged in here like this?

11:47.665 --> 11:50.292
-I don't know.
-He slipped climbing out of the window.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.377
I want him out of my bathroom.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.796
Ah, he will get out
of your bathroom, Carl,

11:53.879 --> 11:55.089
if you give that hammer to Officer Hill.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.967
-I'm not worth being killed for!
-Ma'am, please!

11:58.050 --> 12:00.261
Give the hammer to Officer Hill here!

12:00.344 --> 12:03.431
(Rudy whimpering)

12:03.514 --> 12:05.224
Attaboy, Carl. Way to go.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.767
Oh, did he give him the hammer?

12:06.851 --> 12:08.602
-Yeah, I got the hammer, sir.
-(Rudy whimpers)

12:08.686 --> 12:11.647
-Do you forgive me, sugar?
-Take it easy, okay?

12:12.648 --> 12:14.608
Now, what we have to do here is...

12:14.692 --> 12:16.235
(screams)

12:16.318 --> 12:17.862
-HILL: Be careful now.
-Don't do that!

12:17.945 --> 12:20.698
RUDY (breathing heavily):
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

12:20.781 --> 12:22.742
I think we got a problem here, son.

12:23.409 --> 12:27.413
-(indistinct chatter)
-Let's get a little room here. Excuse me.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.462
He gave everything. He didn't fight.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.839
Why did they shoot him?

12:38.841 --> 12:39.884
Would you like to sit down?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.932
Do you remember anything else at all
about the way they looked?

12:47.558 --> 12:49.769
They're white. They have--

12:50.186 --> 12:52.563
-WOMAN (on radio):<i> Unit 2203...</i>
-I don't see them very well.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.357
Mrs. Rodriguez, there are going to be
some detectives

12:55.441 --> 12:57.443
that are going to come back
in a little while to talk to you.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.447
There's going to be some men also
that will try to get some fingerprints.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.282
So you're going to have
to keep the store closed

13:03.365 --> 13:05.576
and just don't touch anything
at all. All right?

13:06.327 --> 13:07.536
You catch them?

13:08.829 --> 13:10.372
Do you have someone to come stay with you?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.750
My children will be home for lunch.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.419
We got a call for Saint Mary's Church.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.254
Sounds pretty bad. Crowd control.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.136
-(clamoring)
-Get back. Get out of the way!

13:28.516 --> 13:29.433
Keep it clear!

13:35.648 --> 13:39.235
MAN: Get down! Get back!

13:40.486 --> 13:42.696
REPORTER:
Captain, can we just get a word with you?

13:44.907 --> 13:45.825
Captain Furillo.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.952
Lieutenant Calletano.

13:58.045 --> 14:00.714
Uh, Rosa Lombardy.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.219
Her name in Christ is Sister Anna Carmela.

14:06.887 --> 14:10.724
Thirty-eight. Raped, beaten with fists
and blunt instruments. Mutilated.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.979
They carved crosses in her torso
and thighs with a knife.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.772
Multiple internal injuries.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.732
Shock and severe hemorrhaging.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.860
Multiple skull fractures.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.114
The ME thinks probably drugs
with the level of violence.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.782
Witnesses?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.410
Sister Agnes looked out
the convent window.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.996
Saw a couple of guys
running away from the sacristy.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.540
She didn't see much, Frank.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.460
Get her down to the station.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.505
I want a house-to-house
of streets facing the church.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.715
Question the priest.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.467
Any assaults or burglaries
on or near the premises

14:45.551 --> 14:47.052
with Sister Anna being harassed.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.222
Get a list of all the parishioners.
I want everybody questioned.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.893
Inventory of what was taken
as quickly as you can. Ray.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.861
-(reporters clamoring)
-(helicopter whirring)

15:07.323 --> 15:08.782
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.245
CALLETANO:
Get your hands off that car, please!

15:13.662 --> 15:14.538
Thank you very much.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.459
Get me out of here fast, Ray.
I think I'm going to be sick.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.090
(indistinct chatter)

15:25.174 --> 15:26.592
Leo! Leo!

15:26.675 --> 15:29.428
Would you please escort the press
to the outside of the building? Thank you.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.306
Howard, take your men outside, would you?

15:32.389 --> 15:34.183
There are the makings
of a first-class mob.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.811
Alf! Alf! In my office.

15:41.440 --> 15:46.445
Alf, I want a list of everybody with an MO
for church busting in the last decade.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.280
I want to know who's been arrested
for loitering in churches,

15:48.364 --> 15:51.241
for disrupting church services,
or for vandalizing churches.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.661
I want to know everybody
who's been dealing in religious artifacts

15:53.744 --> 15:56.246
or anything vaguely connected
with church services.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.249
I want a list of sex offenders
with a history of this kind of violence.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.419
I'll go through Division first,
then put in a BCI request.

16:02.711 --> 16:05.547
Do it. Good. Oh.
Keep a line open to the labs

16:05.631 --> 16:08.217
because when the evidence comes in,
we want to match it up with names.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.095
-Right.
-Ray, call all the pawnshops.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.597
Tell 'em we want anything
that comes in from a church.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.808
And even if they're not sure,
have 'em call in.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.060
And contact all the religious leaders
in the community.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.687
That means every denomination.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.356
This crime is going to make them ugly,
and we'll need all the help we can get

16:22.439 --> 16:24.274
keeping the hysteria
at a manageable level.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.026
All right.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.404
Captain, we just got word
from the hospital

16:28.487 --> 16:29.613
that Sister Anna's in surgery.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.615
They expect it to take several hours.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.784
Keep me posted. Hold it, hold it.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.705
That's got to be Sister Agnes.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.543
Tell 'em to run her through the mug books.
But not here, in private.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.211
-Use interrogation.
-Right.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.592
(indistinct chatter)

16:50.676 --> 16:53.178
Yes. Yes!

16:53.929 --> 16:56.640
Get me a supervisor
or somebody with authority.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.644
-I came to bail out Eddie Graig.
-SCHNITZ: Come over this way.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.897
Just tell your superior
that I am unable to make

17:03.981 --> 17:07.276
the 4:30 appointment
to audit my tax return.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.321
Because I'm a police officer
and there is a crisis!

17:13.365 --> 17:14.950
CALLETANO: What do you mean,
that's no excuse?

17:15.909 --> 17:18.120
Does a man have to be dying in his bed?

17:20.873 --> 17:23.125
You wouldn't do that to me. You can't!

17:24.168 --> 17:26.754
CALLETANO:
This is the United States of America!

17:29.298 --> 17:30.215
You can?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.222
Maricon.

17:39.183 --> 17:43.353
Costing me money, money and aggravation.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.441
I'm tempted to leave him out in the rain
and just let him melt.

17:47.524 --> 17:50.194
Ramon, I want to go home.

17:53.489 --> 17:57.326
Tell me. Who's going to buy you
in this condition, huh?

17:58.452 --> 18:01.455
If I had known that there would be
a downtown in the apparatus,

18:02.081 --> 18:04.750
I would let the city come down
and take care of the tab.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.251
Who are you, toe jam?

18:06.960 --> 18:10.130
Not so close, Rover.
I didn't have my typhoid shots this year.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.883
-Ramon Hernandez. He's bailing out--
-I asked him!

18:12.966 --> 18:15.886
-Please don't get involved.
-Don't tell me where to get involved!

18:15.969 --> 18:18.222
My, my, my. Personal involvement.

18:18.597 --> 18:22.476
I see Eddie has soothed at least one
savage breast with his boyish charms.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.978
I asked you a question, mincemeat.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.148
I'm his business manager.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.692
And I'm going to take him home.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.402
Right, Eddie?

18:34.613 --> 18:35.489
Come here.

18:38.325 --> 18:41.411
Don't look at me. Look at yourself.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.080
What would you say, a young Dietrich?

18:43.163 --> 18:45.582
You keep laughing, pal.
You're killing yourself.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.086
I should tell you about some of the things
I've seen happen to your types.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.212
You wouldn't laugh so much.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.258
And that hair bag out there
is bleeding you to death.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.427
-Ramon is my only friend.
-Like hell he is!

19:00.013 --> 19:03.100
You seem like a pretty good guy.
Why do you keep degrading yourself?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.354
-It's what I do.
-Then stop doing it.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.356
Clean up your act, for God's sake!

19:09.857 --> 19:11.024
You're so dear.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.444
You were right.
I should've kept out of this. Come on.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.377
(door opens)

19:32.796 --> 19:35.883
-Sister Agnes, this is Captain Furillo.
-Sister.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.052
I'm afraid I'm not being
much help, Captain.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.430
You're doing fine, Sister.
Just keep looking.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.184
They were running away, Captain.
I hardly saw them.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.353
None of these faces means anything.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.315
Don't be too hard on yourself, Sister.
These things take time.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.944
We'll find these men,
and I swear to you, they'll be punished.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.864
SISTER AGNES: I saw the things
that they did to her body.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.991
It will be a hard memory to live with.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.244
But I know Sister Anna
has already forgiven them.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.495
I wish I could.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.169
(groans)

20:12.544 --> 20:14.963
(hisses) The damn bolts are frozen solid!

20:15.047 --> 20:19.009
Oh. You wouldn't believe how often
these things happen, you know?

20:19.384 --> 20:21.136
And you can lose 'em.
They can strangle on you.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.013
It ain't as simple as it looks.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.432
I don't know why you don't try
refined olive oil.

20:25.515 --> 20:28.435
MAN: Petroleum jelly
and shampoo is the best we've got.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.103
Not saying it works every time.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.439
How are you doing there, Rudy, bro?

20:33.148 --> 20:36.735
RUDY: I'm sick, I'm nauseous
and I can't breathe.

20:37.027 --> 20:37.945
Okay. If this doesn't work,

20:38.028 --> 20:39.446
we're going to have to call
the fire department. All right?

20:39.863 --> 20:41.740
I want him out of here.
I want him out right now!

20:41.823 --> 20:43.784
Carl, would you, please!

20:44.451 --> 20:47.454
All right. Are you guys ready
to do something about this here?

20:47.537 --> 20:50.624
-I'm ready. You ready, Larry?
-I'm ready. How about you?

20:50.707 --> 20:52.960
-You ready?
-RUDY: Yeah. I'm ready.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.420
Terrific! Everybody's ready.
All right. Come on over here.

20:55.504 --> 20:59.007
Now, pull a hold of here on his leg
and pull.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.051
-Now, on the count.
-Yeah.

21:01.134 --> 21:05.097
ALL: One, two, three. (groaning)

21:05.180 --> 21:06.723
-Okay, it's coming.
-No, it's not!

21:06.807 --> 21:08.684
-RENA: He's turning blue!
-(all shouting)

21:08.767 --> 21:10.310
Hey, the guy ain't breathing!

21:10.602 --> 21:12.604
-(all shouting)
-Watch it! Watch it!

21:12.688 --> 21:15.941
-CARL: Watch it! Watch it!
-RENA: He's going to die!

21:17.359 --> 21:19.403
-(retching)
-RENA: I can't help myself.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.738
I love that face!

21:22.656 --> 21:24.283
RUDY: I'm going to be sick!

21:27.494 --> 21:29.997
Why don't you go outside
and play, okay? Good.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.206
(sighs)

21:31.290 --> 21:34.209
Now, can you go into more detail
about what they were wearing?

21:34.626 --> 21:37.754
-What do you mean?
-Were their shirts long or short-sleeved?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.257
Did they have cuffs
on their pants? Styles?

21:40.340 --> 21:41.842
You're going to get hurt up there.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.637
What about their general appearances?
Any scars? Acne?

21:46.221 --> 21:48.765
Bad teeth? Was one taller
or shorter than the other?

21:48.849 --> 21:52.352
Come on, man. Hey, man,
where's the damn Forensics?

21:52.436 --> 21:53.478
Saint Mary's.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.022
-(sighs)
-KID: Here.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.440
-Go on.
-(sighs)

21:56.523 --> 21:58.233
Hey, don't touch anything
back there. All right?

21:58.859 --> 22:00.527
-Be a good guy now.
-LARUE: Come on, man.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.828
Hey, let's just do our job, eh, babe?

22:10.454 --> 22:12.748
Hey, man, we're wasting our time, huh.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.833
The scene's been trampled on
by half the neighborhood.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.085
I can get a better suspect description
out of Helen Keller,

22:17.169 --> 22:19.338
and Forensics is tied up till next Easter.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.631
-It's a write-off, man.
-Well, you tell her that, huh?

22:22.049 --> 22:24.760
You think I like it any better
than you do? Now let's face it.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.430
On the homicide hit parade, this ain't
exactly number 10 with a bullet.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.725
Now we can stay here
and waste time and play games,

22:31.808 --> 22:33.852
or we can move on
to something more promising.

22:33.935 --> 22:36.271
-Cost efficiency, right, J.D.?
-You got it.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.148
-Results, my man.
<i>-</i>MAN (on radio):<i> 767.</i>

22:41.735 --> 22:44.529
-767.
<i>-See citizen at 1754.</i>

22:44.613 --> 22:46.907
MAN: I told 'em I had to go
and get the jeweler's scale.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.242
And I went in the back
and I called the station.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.079
I mean, I heard what happened up
at Saint Mary's this morning.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.164
And then when I came back out here,
they was gone.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.375
-Saint Mary's?
-Two guys, about 10 minutes ago.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.710
They came in here
and tried to pawn some religious stuff.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.420
-Six minutes. More like eight.
-Six...

23:00.504 --> 23:04.007
Soon as he goes to use the phone,
they get jumpy, take off and split.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.051
Yeah, they-they went that way.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.929
Straight ahead, on-on foot.
I-I saw them, the two of them.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.473
The tall one had a black fishnet shirt
and gray pants.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.642
-The other, jeans and a gray sweatshirt.
-I'll radio for backup.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.186
-A ripped gray sweatshirt.
-A ripped gray sweatshirt.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.397
Yeah. They couldn't have gotten very far.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.773
Okay, thank you, sir.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.736
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Two possible suspects from Saint Mary's</i>

23:24.820 --> 23:26.905
<i>in the vicinity of Van Buren and Utica.</i>

23:27.614 --> 23:29.449
<i>Two Black males between 20 and 25.</i>

23:29.533 --> 23:32.202
LARUE (on radio):<i> We're approaching</i>
<i>132nd and Lynwood. Clear up here.</i>

23:33.662 --> 23:35.122

23:35.205 --> 23:39.418
<i>Unit 2203, in the vicinity of Utica</i>
<i>and 138th is clear.</i>

23:39.501 --> 23:42.462
You know, that's 30 seconds per block.
That's four or five minutes.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.423
They could be all the way
to Dexter Avenue by now.

23:47.300 --> 23:50.262
-Hold it. Get back. I think we got it.
-(siren wailing)

23:52.347 --> 23:54.391
-HILL: That's them.
-All right. Let's punch it.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.351
2202. We got 'em.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.812
They're going north on Utica,
west of Elwood.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.314
They're going down an alley.
Just south of Jefferson.

24:01.398 --> 24:04.151
-(tires screeching)
-(siren wailing)

24:08.947 --> 24:10.157

24:43.273 --> 24:45.901
Hey, come on. Move back. Move back.
Give 'em some room.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.737
FEMALE REPORTER:
Who are they? Can you give me some names?

24:50.238 --> 24:51.865
COFFEY: All right. Let's imagine
there's a line here.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.575
We're not going to go beyond this line.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.745
(indistinct chatter)

24:56.828 --> 24:58.538
-(pants)
-Was it clean? Were they advised?

24:58.622 --> 24:59.998
Oh, yeah. Right away.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.417
-What'd they say?
-Oh, they're a couple of virgins.

25:02.501 --> 25:06.004
-They found the stuff in an alley.
-(shouting)

25:06.087 --> 25:07.923
Henry, show Sister Agnes the church stuff.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.925
Then arrange a lineup.
We'll wait for their lawyers.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.844
Mm-hmm. And how long you lived there?

25:12.928 --> 25:15.805
A couple of months!
(coughs) Get out of my face!

25:16.097 --> 25:17.641
-Or what?
-Or I'll spit in it!

25:17.724 --> 25:22.145
LARUE: Hey, you spit in my face,
Celestine, and I'll break both your arms!

25:22.479 --> 25:24.898
-Now, why'd you beat up the sister?
-What sister?

25:25.690 --> 25:29.110
-(coughs) Hey, where's my lawyer at?
-He's on the way.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.822
Now, I already told you,
you don't have to tell us anything,

25:32.906 --> 25:36.034
unless you figured your buddy, Gerald,
is giving you up to my partner.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.536
Giving me up for what?

25:37.827 --> 25:39.621
Man, we tried to move some equipment.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.415
Talk about we got over
some nun. (sniffing)

25:43.333 --> 25:45.669
-What do you mean, "got over"?
-Raped her. Whatever.

25:46.795 --> 25:47.879
LARUE: Nobody here said rape.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.382
Well, beat her up!
Hey, where's my damn lawyer?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.305
Hey, hey, check our sheet, brother.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.517
I mean, we did some breaking in,
but never nothing like this here

26:00.600 --> 26:02.269
what you're saying with this sister.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.688
Was it you who robbed
those other churches?

26:05.897 --> 26:08.024
Maybe we did, maybe we didn't, you know?

26:09.651 --> 26:11.027
I have to check with my lawyer.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.282
GERALD: Hey, but I definitely say
we didn't do nothing with this other job.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.992
You telling me your partner
couldn't do violence?

26:17.701 --> 26:20.829
Hey, man, you talking about a fight?
I mean, Celestine's--I mean, he's bad!

26:21.246 --> 26:23.665
He'd take on that cowboy dude, you see?

26:23.748 --> 26:26.626
But he wouldn't be messing
with no religious nun.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.297
No good, Gerald. You guys did it.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.757
Celestine may have been in front.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.843
Do you want to help yourself out?

26:35.677 --> 26:37.429
Yeah, I'll help myself out, Jack.

26:37.512 --> 26:40.390
I'll shut up and wait till my mouth
get here. Move off me!

26:43.518 --> 26:48.189
Frank, we got a positive ID
from Sister Agnes on the church items.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.191
Good. Did Chelsey get the search warrant
for their rooming house?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.526
Yeah. He's on his way over there.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.903
-FURILLO: Are we ready in lineup?
-I got Bates waiting with the sister.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.947
-We'll need a lab report.
-Belker's working on that.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.032
-Tell him to kick some butts.
-JOYCE: Frank. Frank.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.700
-Can we get something
on the arrest, Captain?

26:59.326 --> 27:01.328
Ralph Mancuso, this is Captain Furillo.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.079
-Hi.
-How are you?

27:03.163 --> 27:05.790
We're here to see Celestine Grey
and Gerald Chapman.

27:06.833 --> 27:09.878
I'm going to be doing affiliate work
with Miss Davenport's office, Captain.

27:09.961 --> 27:13.506
As you probably know, the public defender
isn't permitted to defend...

27:13.590 --> 27:15.133
-Yes, I know.
-...multiple suspects.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.512
I'd like to go on record that's
a frightening group of people outside.

27:19.596 --> 27:22.057
They think your clients have committed
a frightening crime.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.934
They'll need extra protection
going to arraignment.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.312
They'll get it, but first
I want them in lineup.

27:27.395 --> 27:28.313
Lineup for whom?

27:28.396 --> 27:30.231
For the sister
who saw the suspects fleeing.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.942
We've already connected your people
with the goods. Excuse me.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.169
GOLDBLUME: All the way to the end.
Hit your marks. Face forward.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.929
Get your head up, number five.
Number four, take your hat off.

28:10.313 --> 28:11.606
Take your time, Sister.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.778
GOLDBLUME: Turn to your left, profile.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.250
I don't know. I'm sorry.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.752
I was too far away
and they were running so fast.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.096
Frank.

28:45.765 --> 28:48.810
-Damn!
-She died without regaining consciousness.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.942
Captain, the lab reports
are a little sketchy.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.945
They had to operate. That didn't help
too much with the forensics.

28:59.028 --> 29:01.030
-BATES: Lieutenant Calletano?
-They give us anything?

29:01.114 --> 29:04.909
Just the blood type. The attacker
was type 0, for whatever that's worth.

29:04.993 --> 29:09.497
-Do they know how many?
-No. Are we going to lose these guys?

29:10.331 --> 29:12.333
I'm worried when we bring them out, Frank.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.962
Howard says there are 200 people
on the streets and more coming.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.964
Get some backups from Jefferson Heights.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.342
MAN: When are they
going to take 'em downtown?

29:21.426 --> 29:23.595
-What's it to you, son?
-Come on. I got a right to ask.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.847
-What, you protect 'em?
-Yeah, we do.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.474
(breathes deeply)

29:27.557 --> 29:29.559
-(door opens)
-Frank.

29:30.518 --> 29:34.105
I don't have to fly my colors
for you to know I'm a law and order man.

29:34.647 --> 29:38.526
-Howard.
-Frank, I believe in justice,

29:38.610 --> 29:40.278
swift and sure.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.239
I've been willing to put my body
on the line to deliver it.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.616
What's your problem, How--?

29:46.451 --> 29:49.204
I have been standing
out there getting pelted

29:49.662 --> 29:52.457
by what I suspect to be
a pretty fair fraction

29:52.540 --> 29:55.627
of this week's dairy
and vegetable purchases on the Hill.

29:55.710 --> 29:58.296
And I have been asking myself, why?

29:59.839 --> 30:01.299
We're bringing in reinforcements
from the Heights.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.218
Oh, that's not the point, Frank.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.220
If I wanted someone
to interpose themselves

30:05.303 --> 30:07.680
between those pulsing masses
and these savages,

30:07.764 --> 30:09.474
I would just as soon it were me.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.143
After all, my EATers are family men.

30:12.227 --> 30:15.855
No, Frank, the question is, why?
Why should any of us?

30:15.939 --> 30:17.565
-Howard--
-Frank, I know.

30:19.567 --> 30:20.485
I know.

30:21.903 --> 30:26.574
(sighs) It's blasphemy.
But doggone it, Frank.

30:26.658 --> 30:31.079
When I think of that poor nun,
when I think of these miscreants,

30:31.162 --> 30:34.040
when I contemplate their endless sojourn

30:34.123 --> 30:36.835
through the futility
of that judicial process,

30:37.502 --> 30:39.087
Frank, I think to myself,

30:39.754 --> 30:44.801
let us provide that mob
with the lumber and the tools

30:44.884 --> 30:46.970
and-and the picture of the scaffold,

30:47.804 --> 30:52.809
and then we'll throw open the prison gates
and let those two subhuman savages

30:52.892 --> 30:56.396
be consumed by the monster
that they have created.

31:00.358 --> 31:04.279
(sighs) One man's opinion, without tears.

31:06.489 --> 31:09.492
-(water runs)
-Thanks for the input, Howard.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.538
(door opens)

31:16.332 --> 31:17.917
-(door closes)
-(sniffs)

31:21.880 --> 31:22.839
Eggplant?

31:22.922 --> 31:25.884
(clamoring)

31:25.967 --> 31:28.636
No. Leo, I need a visitor's pass.

31:29.929 --> 31:33.099
We know two men are in custody,
but as yet we have no names,

31:33.182 --> 31:35.852
or if in fact the police
intend to make formal charges.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.354
-Where's Lieutenant Calletano?
-I think he's in the squad room.

31:40.148 --> 31:44.360
(chatter continues)

31:45.361 --> 31:47.155
-Right there.
-Thank you very much.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.073
So what's it like out front?

31:49.157 --> 31:51.451
Well, they're not too keen
on the judicial process.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.204
-Lieutenant Calletano?
-Yes.

31:55.288 --> 31:58.708
I'm Donald Murphy. I'll be going with you
to the IRS this afternoon.

31:58.791 --> 32:01.502
I don't understand. Where is Mr. Owens?

32:01.711 --> 32:03.338
He's no longer with the company.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.715
But I've had a quick look at your return.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.425
Everything seems fairly in order.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.846
But you don't know about
the lottery ticket or dress patterns.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.933
-How can you go with me?
-What dress patterns?

32:16.476 --> 32:20.188
I didn't declare some extra income.
Mr. Owens said not to.

32:21.981 --> 32:25.109
Well, that's a definite infraction.
Uh, I must remind you, Lieutenant,

32:25.193 --> 32:26.945
that we don't accompany you
as legal advisers.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.239
-I want to see Mr. Owens.
-So does the FBI.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.493
There are warrants out for his arrest
for interstate fraud.

32:34.077 --> 32:37.080
They think he's in Paraguay or Bolivia.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.831
Oh,<i> made mía.</i>

32:39.749 --> 32:42.835
I don't know.
I guess your return looks in order,

32:42.919 --> 32:45.630
providing the IRS hasn't found out
about the additional income.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.508
-What would they do to me?
-Excuse me?

32:50.093 --> 32:51.970
If they know, what will happen to me?

32:52.804 --> 32:55.556
(chuckles) Yeah, I'm a little curious
about that myself.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.642
see, this is my first week on the job.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.435
Kind of moonlighting,
if you know what I mean.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.938
Primarily, I sell biodegradable
soap products.

33:02.313 --> 33:06.651
Lieutenant, have you ever held
a handful of ordinary laundry detergent?

33:06.985 --> 33:10.196
There's a burning sensation.
That's the phosphates.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.198
Phosphates.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.076
I am not going.

33:15.493 --> 33:20.415
Lieutenant, I'm told the IRS
does not take kindly to no-shows.

33:20.623 --> 33:22.834
Get out. Get out!

33:23.292 --> 33:25.586
Just search it again, Alf,
and then come back in.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.298
Yeah, and the vicinity
of the building too. Right. Okay.

33:35.096 --> 33:38.224
Oh, Joe, uh, have Leo call
the DA's office. Hello.

33:38.307 --> 33:41.394
And, uh, tell Bernstein not to leave
for the grand jury till I get there.

33:41.477 --> 33:44.355
Uh, Captain, this is
Mrs. Eladio Rodriguez. Her husband.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.858
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Where are your men, Captain?

33:46.941 --> 33:50.611
I wait for the detectives to come back.
I wait for who takes fingerprints.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.697
I want who killed my husband to be caught!

33:52.780 --> 33:55.408
-Mrs. Rodriguez--
-I know the sister is attacked today.

33:56.159 --> 33:57.910
Did the sister support a family?

33:57.994 --> 34:01.122
Does she have beautiful hands
like my Eladio had?

34:02.123 --> 34:06.252
Mrs. Rodriguez, will you please talk
to Detective Goldblume? He'll help you.

34:06.711 --> 34:07.670
(sighs)

34:08.129 --> 34:09.672
Joe will fill you in. Do what you can.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.257
COFFEY: Detective Goldblume
is going to help.

34:16.512 --> 34:19.015
MAN: Get your hands off me!
Man, get off me!

34:22.060 --> 34:23.519
Would you please?

34:24.437 --> 34:27.648
Excuse me. Ow! You're on my foot.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.776
Get off me, man!

34:29.859 --> 34:31.360
Frank! Frank!

34:31.444 --> 34:32.904
(clamoring)

34:32.987 --> 34:35.865
-What is going on here?
-Fay, I'm on my way out.

34:35.948 --> 34:39.535
-WOMAN: Look out! He's got a gun!
-(all screaming)

34:39.619 --> 34:41.829
(gun shots)

34:46.542 --> 34:50.338
You're trying to kill me!
You're trying to kill me!

34:50.421 --> 34:53.341
(grunting)

34:54.342 --> 34:57.053
-Get him into interrogation now!
-(shouting)

34:57.136 --> 34:59.472
Everybody out. The press.
Everybody out. now. Right now!

34:59.555 --> 35:01.390
Bates, get somebody on the front door.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.518
Don't let anybody through
unless it's connected with a case.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.729
-And frisk everyone. Anybody hit?
-No. I think he shot high.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.483
-You okay?
-Frank, um...

35:11.692 --> 35:15.905
You know, I just came by to ask you
about Frank Jr.'s school registration.

35:16.155 --> 35:19.075
Well, see, they want to skip him
a grade. And...

35:19.158 --> 35:21.077
Well, I'm real happy about it.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.622
Well, I was thinking, you know,

35:24.705 --> 35:26.666
maybe he should stay with his own
age group. What do you think?

35:26.749 --> 35:29.418
Fay, could we talk about
this some other time?

35:29.710 --> 35:33.214
He did so well on
his achievement test and, uh...

35:33.965 --> 35:37.802
I was so proud.
Oh, my God, Frank. I'm bleeding.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.637
You just caught some flying glass.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.722
I don't think it's serious,
but you're going to the hospital anyway.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.307
Ray. Ray!

35:44.433 --> 35:46.352
-FURILLO: Can you stand?
-FAY: I think so.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.688
I'll call you at the hospital.
You all right?

35:48.771 --> 35:52.567
(people shouting)

36:04.412 --> 36:07.623
(siren wailing in the distance)

36:09.542 --> 36:10.418
(door opens)

36:12.211 --> 36:15.423
-BERNSTEIN: I'm sorry. I heard she died.
-(door closes)

36:16.799 --> 36:20.553
(sighs) For the grand jury, we are going
to need the arresting officer,

36:21.012 --> 36:23.347
the officers who recovered
and ran down the religious articles

36:23.431 --> 36:25.224
and one of the articles themselves.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.767
We can have an indictment by six o'clock.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.561
Don't go to the grand jury, Owen.

36:28.936 --> 36:29.770
Don't go?

36:31.564 --> 36:33.274
We've got a whole city screaming
for action on this.

36:33.649 --> 36:36.861
I know you can get an indictment now,
but what about down the road?

36:37.987 --> 36:40.990
We have no weapon, no forensics.
No one to place them at Saint Mary's.

36:41.073 --> 36:43.492
And all they have for priors
are low-rent B&amp;E's.

36:43.951 --> 36:46.287
-You search their place yet?
-Nothing in it.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.539
No prints in the church either.

36:48.623 --> 36:53.294
(sighs) So, come on.
You take six months, you build a case.

36:53.878 --> 36:57.089
Irwin, I have a lot of wrapping
with nothing in the package.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.717
You know as well as I do,
what we don't have today

36:59.800 --> 37:01.093
isn't going to get any better tomorrow.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.596
They did it, didn't they?

37:05.932 --> 37:08.893
Frank, (sighs) if you're holding
something back from me--

37:08.976 --> 37:11.854
I'm not holding anything back.
Of course they did it.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.398
I watched these guys in interrogation.

37:14.482 --> 37:17.235
For an hour and a half,
the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.

37:18.819 --> 37:22.031
-So?
-So, I need a confession, now.

37:22.698 --> 37:26.202
If we indict for murder without it,
they go right into protective.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.037
Their lawyers are around them
like armor plate,

37:28.120 --> 37:31.123
and six months from now
we don't have a confession or a case.

37:32.375 --> 37:36.337
-But consider the alternative.
-What alternative?

37:36.420 --> 37:39.173
We charge them with what we have--
stolen property.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.593
We set the bail accordingly and they'll
have an interesting choice, won't they?

37:44.887 --> 37:47.598
Are you kidding?
Frank, there's a lynch mob out there.

37:47.682 --> 37:51.727
I know there's a lynch mob out there.
I think I can use it.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.648
You will be signing a death warrant.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.066
Call the judge.

38:01.487 --> 38:03.197
-(tapping fingers)
-(scoffs)

38:05.491 --> 38:09.996
Mrs. Bernstein,
look what your son Irwin is doing.

38:10.079 --> 38:12.081
(dialing phone)

38:12.665 --> 38:16.294
BAILIFF: 26 on the calendar.
Gerald Chapman and Celestine Grey.

38:16.377 --> 38:21.048
Charged with one 40.20 misdemeanor,
possession of stolen property.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.467
(crowd murmuring)

38:24.218 --> 38:25.511
(gavel bangs)

38:30.224 --> 38:31.726
Mr. DA, your application?

38:34.270 --> 38:38.232
Your Honor, in view of the relative lack
of seriousness of the crimes charged,

38:38.316 --> 38:39.984
the People are not asking for bail.

38:40.067 --> 38:41.819
Defendants may be released
on their own recognizance.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.904
-(gavels bangs)
-JUDGE: Defense counsel?

38:44.488 --> 38:48.117
-Uh, very reasonable.
-Reasonable?

38:49.243 --> 38:51.746
Judge, my client was shot
at this afternoon.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.958
My client's name is in every newspaper
connected to a heinous crime.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.586
Look at this courtroom
infested with vultures.

38:58.961 --> 39:01.339
I demand protective incarceration
for my client.

39:01.964 --> 39:05.718
JUDGE: As you know, Miss Davenport,
it's not the purpose of bail

39:05.801 --> 39:09.013
to protect defendants from matters
not before this court.

39:09.638 --> 39:13.142
DA's request granted.
Released on recognizance.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.394
-(chattering)
-Judge, is the court unaware

39:15.478 --> 39:17.688
there may be mob contracts
on my client's life?

39:18.397 --> 39:22.860
JUDGE: Miss Davenport, this is a tribunal
of rules and procedures.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.780
If your client were charged with a felony,

39:25.863 --> 39:30.368
he could elect to remain in custody
under CCP 3606.

39:30.451 --> 39:33.162
But since we only have a misdemeanor--

39:33.245 --> 39:34.747
Why only a misdemeanor, Judge?

39:34.830 --> 39:36.165
Can you answer me that? Why?

39:36.957 --> 39:40.044
The items taken from the church
are very possibly of felony value.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.714
Are you going to let the DA
avoid the intent of 3606

39:43.798 --> 39:45.674
by connivingly charging
only a misdemeanor?

39:45.758 --> 39:49.261
Don't let her start with that technical
stuff, Judge! Give 'em to us!

39:49.345 --> 39:52.598
-(crowd shouting)
-(gavel bangs)

39:53.808 --> 39:56.977
Your Honor, rather than overtax
the Corrections Department

39:57.061 --> 39:58.479
with a needless incarceration,

39:58.562 --> 40:00.272
the People have decided
simply to drop the charges.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.733
The defendants,
though they remain prime suspects

40:02.817 --> 40:04.944
in a capital crime, are free to go.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.279
Free to go?
Your Honor, this is a travesty.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.573
I petition for police protection
for my client.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.118
You'll have to speak
to Captain Furillo about that.

40:12.701 --> 40:15.079
Charges dismissed on motion of DA.

40:15.496 --> 40:18.124
For the record then. For the record!

40:18.916 --> 40:21.001
The district attorney
and the police department

40:21.085 --> 40:24.547
have clearly conspired
to dismiss the charges in this case

40:24.880 --> 40:27.716
in order to coerce a confession
of murder by my client

40:27.800 --> 40:29.427
or his co-defendant.

40:31.178 --> 40:34.807
So what we have here
is a neat little exercise

40:34.890 --> 40:36.851
in legalist vigilantism.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.564
What got you into their bed, Your Honor?

40:42.690 --> 40:44.483
A little letter of the law in one ear,

40:44.567 --> 40:46.360
a little good of the community
in the other?

40:46.444 --> 40:50.114
Miss Davenport,
before you extend your speculations,

40:50.531 --> 40:53.451
I'm going to suggest
that you reflect on the fact

40:53.534 --> 40:56.579
that there is no longer a case
before this court.

40:56.996 --> 41:00.749
And then count whatever it is you count

41:01.292 --> 41:03.878
when you're trying to regain
your self-control.

41:05.212 --> 41:08.591
-In the interim, this court is adjourned.
-(gavel bangs)

41:08.674 --> 41:10.426
(shouting) And don't you ever,

41:12.094 --> 41:13.804
when you come before this bench,

41:14.388 --> 41:18.350
ever speak like that to me again,

41:19.059 --> 41:20.769
or I'll throw you in jail.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.564
(crowd murmuring)

41:30.821 --> 41:32.531
You railroading bastard!

41:32.615 --> 41:35.784
Captain, my client has advised me
he would like to talk with you.

41:37.578 --> 41:40.831
Second degree murder
with no recommendation for leniency.

41:40.998 --> 41:44.251
(scoffs) Captain,
you're talking 25-to-life.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.087
You work the numbers, counselor.
No leniency.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.509
But we do get the name change
and the federal facility.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.677
Standard change of identity.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.554
Maximum security federal penitentiary.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.724
But he rolls all the way over,
confession plus testimony.

42:01.435 --> 42:02.394
Gerald?

42:04.855 --> 42:06.690
It was Celestine who said to do it.

42:08.859 --> 42:09.818
She wouldn't let us.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.988
She locked us out of the room.

42:15.616 --> 42:18.536
And Celestine,
all loaded and jumpin' bad--

42:23.123 --> 42:24.166
Get the stenographer.

42:30.339 --> 42:32.299
-(telephone ringing)
-(indistinct chatter)

42:35.261 --> 42:37.096
These are about what happens
to some people when...

42:38.973 --> 42:40.057
you know, they get senile.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.769
They're from the library.
You can keep them for 60 days.

42:43.852 --> 42:44.812
Thank you.

42:47.648 --> 42:50.359
-May I call you by your first name?
-Sure.

42:52.403 --> 42:55.698
Mick, it looked like
<i>Living With Forgetting </i>was the best.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.742
I think one of the chapters--

43:00.160 --> 43:01.537
it's about not being ashamed.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.083
I-I put a bookmark.

43:13.465 --> 43:14.466
You look good.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.432
I thought about what you said before
about degrading myself.

43:22.975 --> 43:24.935
No more bus station men's rooms
for Eddie Graig.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.395
Attaboy.

43:26.478 --> 43:28.689
I'm going to work the men's room
at the Hotel Excelsior.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.921
I want you to know
that what you did tonight frightens me.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.633
-I understand.
-Do you?

43:55.716 --> 43:57.843
This is the kind of crime
that tears a city apart.

43:57.926 --> 44:00.638
It brings out but savage
in thousands of people.

44:00.888 --> 44:02.598
It has to be dealt with very quickly.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.975
-So the book goes out the window.
-I went by the book.

44:05.976 --> 44:07.144
I pushed a little hard at the bindings.

44:07.519 --> 44:09.396
That's a crock of
the well-known article, Furillo.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.065
-You bulldozed--
-I did what I've seen you do

44:11.148 --> 44:14.985
for your clients 50 times.
I used every resource.

44:15.235 --> 44:17.488
Furillo, I'm a public defender.

44:18.405 --> 44:21.158
I play a role in a system
of checks and balances.

44:21.575 --> 44:23.118
And other people
are supposed to play theirs

44:23.202 --> 44:24.495
with the same kind of energy.

44:25.371 --> 44:28.832
You with your jungle justice threw that
all out of whack today.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.502
Gerald Chapman would've confessed
to killing Abraham Lincoln

44:31.585 --> 44:33.003
to avoid that mob tonight.

44:34.963 --> 44:36.799
I can live with what I did, Joyce.

44:36.882 --> 44:39.009
I went by my instincts
and they were right.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.387
Under these circumstances,
I'd do it again.

44:41.762 --> 44:43.347
You can trust your instincts, Frank.

44:44.431 --> 44:46.141
Maybe even I can trust your instincts.

44:47.142 --> 44:49.269
But I don't want to trust
everybody's instincts.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.147
I want there to be rules,
and I want them obeyed,

44:52.231 --> 44:54.441
especially by people
who wear badges and guns.

44:56.652 --> 44:58.737
You perverted the law tonight,

44:58.821 --> 45:01.448
and you're so damned happy
about snagging your confession,

45:01.532 --> 45:03.242
you don't even begin to see it yet.

45:05.494 --> 45:06.704
Please see it, Frank.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.211
How's Fay? Is she all right?

45:15.254 --> 45:17.715
I talked to her. She has a couple
of stitches in her head.

45:18.173 --> 45:19.091
Yeah, she's all right.

45:28.851 --> 45:31.061
Frank, I don't think I want
to be with you tonight.

45:31.812 --> 45:32.688
I understand.

45:36.650 --> 45:38.777
Gerald not only gave a confession,

45:38.861 --> 45:40.654
he gave us the location
of the murder weapon.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.740
There's no mistake here.
These are the killers.

45:44.158 --> 45:46.702
Is that where you make
your stand finally, Frank?

45:47.578 --> 45:49.371
With the oldest excuse in the world--

45:50.664 --> 45:52.624
the end justifies the means?

45:57.880 --> 46:02.426
Frank, on the Rodriguez robbery-homicide.

46:03.260 --> 46:06.805
I went over there with Mrs. Rodriguez.
No witnesses.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.016
No way we're going to get an ongoing SID.

46:09.850 --> 46:13.061
Let's at least try, first thing tomorrow.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.065
(sighs)

46:17.775 --> 46:20.819
I'll do my best, but we're really jammed.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.865
I don't think we're going to
make this one, Frank.

46:40.464 --> 46:44.134
-Frank.
-Oh, Ray. How'd it go with the IRS today?

46:44.468 --> 46:47.721
I called the district manager
and explained our situation.

46:48.931 --> 46:51.016
I will see him tomorrow afternoon at 4:30.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.604
The men are proud
of what you did today, Frank.

47:01.443 --> 47:03.779
(dramatic music playing)

48:30.407 --> 48:32.075
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

48:40.083 --> 48:44.296
(closing theme playing)
