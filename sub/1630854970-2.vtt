WEBVTT

00:25.901 --> 00:28.862
So remember that the client pays
for the shoot,

00:28.862 --> 00:30.781
but we pay for the overtime.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.659
So whatever you do, don't go over.

00:33.659 --> 00:36.245
But make the commercial
as good as possible too, right?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.665
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.375
And I had an idea.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.961
Maybe we could all have a picnic together
in the conference room?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.838
I can't make it.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.048
- I didn't tell you when it was.
- I know.

00:48.632 --> 00:52.719
Come on, Barbara. Could be fun.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.390
We could get to know each other a little.
Maybe loosen things up around here.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.059
Well, I've worked with this lot before,

00:59.059 --> 01:03.021
and, yeah, this is as loose as they get.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.866
- We'll see about that, Babs.
- Oh, no. Don't.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.909
Yep. I felt that as soon as I said it.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.913
All right, I'm headed out.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.583
Everyone have a great day, yeah?

01:25.419 --> 01:28.672
Oi, don't do anything I wouldn't do.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.855
What wouldn't she do?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.755
Good morning, Viet--

02:09.755 --> 02:11.089
Ted!

02:11.089 --> 02:13.550
- Hey, look who's here. Hi, Keeley.
- Hello, Ted.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.053
Trent Crimm. Are you kidding me?

02:16.053 --> 02:17.554
Hey, nice to see you, man.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.848
You know, they got a big old Ziploc bag
full of your hair ties

02:19.848 --> 02:21.725
down at the lost and found.
You should pop on down,

02:21.725 --> 02:22.643
if you still want 'em.

02:22.643 --> 02:27.231
Thank you. Mr. Crimm has requested
to follow the club this year.

02:28.357 --> 02:31.026
- He wants to write a book about us.
- Yeah?

02:31.026 --> 02:32.861
I think there's a story here
worth telling, Ted.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.073
Yes, and we all love the idea.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.824
But obviously, as manager,

02:37.824 --> 02:39.952
we thought you should have
the final decision.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.287
Okay.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.291
I mean, geez, you know, like--

02:54.299 --> 02:55.551
No.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.474
Sure, what the heck?
Why not? When can you start?

03:02.474 --> 03:05.477
No time like the present.
Except 11:11. That's my wishing time.

03:05.477 --> 03:09.189
Or 23:11,
if I'm at a military base or Euro Disney.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.942
Right, well. Decision made.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.944
Wonderful. Trent, welcome.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.906
- Holy shit.
- Uh-oh.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.700
Zava is leaving Juventus.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.746
What about their kids? I'm sorry. I didn't
know what any of those things meant.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.540
I thought it was like Greek mythology
or something.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.208
I was just lost.
I just went with that. Sorry.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.253
Zava's a world-class striker
who's about to leave his club in Italy.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.547
Cacio later, Pepe.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.175
Apparently, he wants to play
in the Premier League

03:36.175 --> 03:39.761
because his wife binged The Office
and she wants to live in England.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.847
I think you mean
Scranton, Pennsylvania, buddy.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.640
No, the British Office, Ted.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.893
That's right.
Y'all did a premake over here.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.811
If we got Zava, that would be amazing.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.898
He would be huge for the club's brand.
He's got like 90 million followers.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.483
One time he just
posted the word "7 million likes."

03:53.483 --> 03:54.776
It got 10 million likes.

03:54.776 --> 03:58.405
Yes, but he is very expensive. And isn't
he supposed to be a bit of a diva?

03:58.405 --> 04:01.074
Yes, huge diva. Enormous.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.869
He goes through teams like you
go through manicurists.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.413
The fumes make me dizzy, and I overshare.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.874
Please don't print that.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.919
Zava has played for 14 teams in 15 years,

04:11.919 --> 04:14.213
leaving behind nothing
but chaos and trophies.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.507
Beautiful, shiny trophies.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.384
Yes, but, Leslie,
who wants to deal with all that drama?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.554
Apparently, everyone who can afford him.

04:22.554 --> 04:26.099
Chelsea, Arsenal, United, West Ham.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.392
I say, let's just go for it.

04:27.392 --> 04:31.021
I mean, maybe he's a handful,
but who doesn't love a handful?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.024
I mean, if you're talking salted peanuts,
yes, please.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.734
If you're talking Skittles though,
no, thank you.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.861
You know, the dye melts,
and it gets all over your fingers,

04:37.861 --> 04:39.029
makes 'em all sticky.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.697
And that, you can print.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.078
- Wonderful. Let's set up a meeting.
- Great.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.163
- Let's go and get Zava.
- Yes!

04:48.163 --> 04:49.748
- We're doing it.
- Zava dabba doo!

04:50.499 --> 04:52.876
- Yeah.
- Here we go. Yeah, come on.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.253
This is exciting.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.463
So, am I to assume
that you're going to pursue

04:56.463 --> 05:00.175
a notoriously mercurial player
you can't really afford simply

05:00.175 --> 05:02.511
because the team your ex-husband
owns wants him?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.974
No, no, no, no, no.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.601
Yes.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.230
Love that.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.238
So, hey, come on. Talk to me.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.324
What's it like being the boss
of your own Keeley Street Band, huh?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.118
- I think it's going really good.
- Yeah?

05:26.118 --> 05:27.452
- Yeah.
- Good, good.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.789
Well, I do wish that my co-workers
would loosen up just a little bit.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.625
- You want my advice?
- Yes.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.669
Y'all should go out
and do something together.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.296
You know, like outside of work.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.922
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.842
Maybe I could hire a shaman

05:41.842 --> 05:44.720
and we could do a bunch
of ayahuasca under a blood moon.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.806
I was thinking something
like an escape room,

05:47.806 --> 05:49.558
but, hey, Clamato Clamato, right?

05:49.558 --> 05:51.768
- Yeah. Thanks, Ted.
- Good to see you. Yeah.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.103
- Keeley!
- Yeah?

05:53.103 --> 05:54.897
Isaac. Hi. You all right?

05:54.897 --> 05:56.940
Yeah. Can you help me get a shoe deal?

05:56.940 --> 05:59.985
I'd love to. Any brand in particular?

05:59.985 --> 06:04.031
No brands.
Just shoes, in general. You know.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.367
Great. I'll look into it for you.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.580
- Hi, guys.
- Keeley.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.040
Hi, Keeley.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.708
- Hi, Jamie.
- How you doing? You good, yeah?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.293
Yeah, I'm all right. You?

06:16.293 --> 06:20.297
Yeah, yeah. Not bad. Yeah, yeah. Gym.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.299
- Just went to the gym. So, yeah. Good.
- Good.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.095
Glad you're good. I'll see you later.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.514
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Bye.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.768
- Bruv.
- What's up, man?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.775
Keeley and Roy have broken up.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.361
What? Who told you that?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.781
It's not "who," bruv.
It's "what." Kinesics.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.367
Study of body language. Just look at 'em.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.537
No eye contact, Keeley's crossed arms.

06:52.538 --> 06:57.209
Roy's clenched arse. It's science.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.281
- What do you want?
- You and Keeley break up?

07:28.073 --> 07:30.033
- Who told you that?
- No one.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.869
I use body science.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.872
Why? Is it true?

07:43.088 --> 07:44.131
What's that fucking face?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.592
It's called empathy, you dusty, old fart.

07:47.384 --> 07:51.388
Look, as someone who's been dumped
by Keeley, I get it.

07:52.222 --> 07:56.059
- She didn't dump me.
- You dumped her? Why?

07:56.059 --> 07:58.979
I don't want to talk about it.
Why'd you come in here?

07:59.688 --> 08:00.689
Let me guess.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.941
You want to know if it's okay
to ask her out, right?

08:02.941 --> 08:07.946
No, I was just-- I was just seeing
if you were okay, man.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.327
Dickhead.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.786
- What the fuck you doing?
- I was gonna hug you.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.915
- Well, you came at me too fast.
- Jesus, sorry.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.918
I forget how skittish elderly people
could be 'cause of the war.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.587
Come on, man.
I was just trying to comfort you.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.214
Well, I don't want comfort.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.257
And I told you,
I don't want to talk about it.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.926
So don't you say a fucking word.
Do you hear me?

08:28.926 --> 08:30.469
Fine, I won't.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.722
And don't you say a fucking word
about it either, William.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.099
No, no, I won't.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.393
I actually just went through
a bit of a breakup myself,

08:38.393 --> 08:40.270
so I can somewhat relate.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.023
Hey, maybe we should all go out sometime.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.359
Us three. You know, get a couple drinks,
couple pints, couple shots.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.028
Fishbowls. Single guys club.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.407
Or I can just not say a fucking word.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.451
No, I hear you. I hear you loud and clear.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.078
Well, you are a sleepwalker.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.163
I don't know what else to tell you. Period.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.251
Hey, Coach.

09:04.419 --> 09:05.420
What are you doing?

09:07.172 --> 09:09.007
Just taking a peek
at one of these soccer strategy books

09:09.007 --> 09:09.967
you always got your nose in.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.389
What do you think?

09:16.014 --> 09:18.892
Well, given the struggles I've already had
with the table of contents,

09:18.892 --> 09:20.519
I think I might be best served to wait

09:20.519 --> 09:22.312
until this son of a gun
comes out as a movie.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.692
Hey, let me ask you a couple questions.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.235
One, what would you think if we sign Zava?

09:29.486 --> 09:30.737
That's good, right?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.406
- Zava? Yeah.
- Okay.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.075
Second question. Who is Zava?

09:35.868 --> 09:38.245
He's a living legend.
You know who Zava is.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.163
Beg to differ, Claudia Schiffer.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.093
Now why you got me
watching the Veggie Dog Vigilante here?

09:53.719 --> 09:54.803
<i>Hey.</i>

09:55.429 --> 09:56.430
<i>No way.</i>

09:57.806 --> 09:59.433
Because that's Zava.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.227
That's Zava?

10:03.312 --> 10:05.355
Well, shoot.
I didn't know this fella played football.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.483
Hey, I said football
without even thinking about it.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.652
Boy, that book really works.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.616
11:11. Make a wish.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.372
- What'd you wish for? Come on, Coach.
- I can't tell you that.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.166
I just don't want our wishes
to cancel each other out.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.418
- That's not how it works.
- Shut the fuck up.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.295
- Take it back.
- Uh-oh, now what?

10:28.295 --> 10:29.338
Take it back.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.089
I can't take back things
that's already happened.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.550
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Fellas, what's wrong?

10:33.550 --> 10:35.636
Coach,
we just heard the most upsetting rumor.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.430
Okay, is this about us getting Zava?

10:38.430 --> 10:40.140
- What?
- We're getting Zava?

10:40.140 --> 10:43.477
I just wished for that 30 seconds ago.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.150
Wait, no.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.443
Hold on a second, okay?

10:51.443 --> 10:53.862
If y'all weren't talking about Zava,
what were you so upset about?

10:53.862 --> 10:55.906
Is it 'cause Trent Crimm's
writing a book about us?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.908
What?

10:57.908 --> 11:00.410
Wait, Trent Crimm's writing a book
about Zava joining our team?

11:00.410 --> 11:03.205
No, no. He's just coming here
to write a book about the team.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.706
Zava's writing a book about us?

11:04.706 --> 11:06.166
No, Trent Crimm.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.127
Why would Zava write a book
about Trent Crimm?

11:12.506 --> 11:15.592
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop!
Okay, hold on a second.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.262
If y'all didn't know about Zava,
which may or may not happen,

11:19.304 --> 11:22.057
and y'all didn't know about Trent Crimm,
which is happening,

11:22.057 --> 11:24.393
then what were you so worked up about?

11:27.396 --> 11:28.689
Roy and Keeley broke up.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.609
Coach.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.028
Sorry, no, I'm okay.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.114
Got a little light-headed there.
Yeah, thank you.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.365
Fuck's going on?

11:41.869 --> 11:42.870
Tartt!

11:42.870 --> 11:44.580
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I didn't say anything.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.331
I will fucking kill you.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.709
No, I came in, and they was talking
about us getting Zava.

11:48.709 --> 11:52.421
What? We're getting Zava?

11:52.421 --> 11:54.798
Roy, do you want to talk about it?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.134
No, I'm not talking about me and Keeley.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.470
No, I meant Zava.
Do you want to talk about it?

12:00.470 --> 12:03.015
Sure, he's nuts,
but he'll help us win games.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.142
That time I was actually talking
about you and Keeley.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.561
- Fuck's sake.
- Hey, Will, come here a sec.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.062
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Hey.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.440
I need you to run to my apartment,
go into my desk,

12:11.440 --> 12:14.318
and grab my CD
called "Ted's breakup mix." Okay?

12:14.318 --> 12:15.861
- Got it. What's a CD?
- Okay.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.571
- Oh, boy.
- On it.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.114
Hey, Coach, you gonna need my keys.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.908
- I got a set.
- Right.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.285
- Thanks. Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.704
Hey, Roy, look, we're here for you. Okay?

12:26.205 --> 12:28.040
We've all been dumped before,
right, fellas?

12:29.458 --> 12:32.044
She didn't dump me. I broke up with her.

12:33.921 --> 12:34.838
What?

12:36.048 --> 12:37.674
This day couldn't get any worse.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.510
And this is the locker room. Hello, boys.

12:39.510 --> 12:42.387
- I believe you all know Trent Crimm.
- Gentlemen.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.097
The fuck is this prick doing here?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.266
Trent's writing a book about our season,

12:46.266 --> 12:49.853
so let's welcome him with open arms
and open minds.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.481
Absolutely. Yes.

12:53.482 --> 12:57.069
Oi! Listen up!

12:58.362 --> 13:01.865
No one says a fucking word
around this prick

13:02.366 --> 13:05.827
unless they want my forehead
through their fucking skull!

13:09.206 --> 13:10.290
Don't worry.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.420
Okay, well...

13:18.257 --> 13:20.133
we'll work out the specifics later.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.470
But until then, welcome, Trent.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.104
I mean, fuck off, Trent Crimm.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.588
And cut! Thank you, folks. Moving on.

13:58.630 --> 14:03.093
Okay. Now the lamb chugs
a Cafka mini and poof,

14:03.093 --> 14:05.637
turns into a smoking hot lion.

14:05.637 --> 14:09.099
Great, but we can't actually
make the lamb drink the Cafka mini, right?

14:09.099 --> 14:11.226
- No, of course not.
- Okay, good.

14:11.226 --> 14:15.063
We were told by the people
in the lab, the lamb cannot drink it.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.691
Yeah, no, it will die instantly.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.151
Something about enzymes.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.069
I totally get it.

14:21.612 --> 14:25.073
- I just don't think she does.
- No. I don't think she got it.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.825
Keeley fucking Jones.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.078
Shandy fucking Fine?

14:32.789 --> 14:35.834
Oh, my God!
I didn't know you were doing this.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.003
I didn't know you owned a skirt
that covered your whole arse.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.088
Oi, you borrowed
and never returned many of those skirts.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.089
And I never will.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.091
One of the perks of living
with you and the girls.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.053
- The girls! How are they? How's Chloe?
- Married a footballer.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.013
- And Emma?
- Married a footballer.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.223
And what about you?

14:49.223 --> 14:51.266
Married a footballer,
divorced a footballer.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.684
And now I'm back here doing this.

14:53.268 --> 14:56.271
But enough about me.
I saw you in Vanity Fair.

14:56.772 --> 14:59.399
Fully clothed. And I cried.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.568
I'm so proud of you, babe. We all are.

15:02.486 --> 15:03.779
Proud of me? Why?

15:04.821 --> 15:07.533
'Cause you made it out all by yourself.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.122
What is that smell?

15:14.122 --> 15:16.416
Apologies, lamb droppings

15:16.416 --> 15:18.418
are one of nature's
most unpleasant aromas.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.297
Just be grateful Clarice here
is over 30 days old.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.760
A week ago, her poop
looked like sour, yellow toothpaste.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.056
No, no. Don't try and sweep it.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.851
No, you gotta pick it up like sushi
or it'll smear.

15:35.227 --> 15:36.395
I was married to a footballer.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.231
That's it. Cheers, babe.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.233
- Hey, Keeley.
- Yes?

15:41.233 --> 15:43.902
Jimmy and I think
the club feels too empty.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.529
Yeah, it should feel totally packed.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.282
I mean, can we get maybe
another 100 extras?

15:48.866 --> 15:50.117
A hundred more, right now?

15:50.701 --> 15:51.702
Yeah.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.663
You could just add a strobe effect
to the post

15:54.663 --> 15:56.790
and let people cross close to camera.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.000
It'll feel really packed,

15:58.000 --> 15:59.835
and you won't have
to spend any more money.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.296
- I love that.
- Let's do that.

16:02.296 --> 16:03.672
Thank you so much.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.843
Look at you. Basically running the shoot.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.928
Maybe one day
I'll make it out like you did.

16:11.722 --> 16:12.723
Yeah.

16:16.727 --> 16:17.769
Hello, Mother.

16:17.769 --> 16:21.148
<i>Oh, my God, darling,
I'm so pleased to hear your voice.</i>

16:21.148 --> 16:24.318
<i>I dreamt last night
that you'd been murdered.</i>

16:24.318 --> 16:26.236
No, still here.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.072
<i>Wait, why are you in a hotel room?</i>

16:29.072 --> 16:31.366
<i>I thought you were meant
to be on some three-day,</i>

16:31.366 --> 16:32.910
<i>spiritual camping retreat.</i>

16:32.910 --> 16:35.871
I am. I'm not sleeping out there.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.581
<i>Far too many stars.</i>

16:37.581 --> 16:41.210
<i>I keep thinking they're all staring at me,
you know.</i>

16:41.210 --> 16:44.213
<i>No, but listen.
I've got some exciting news for you.</i>

16:44.213 --> 16:46.173
I spoke to Tish the other day,

16:46.173 --> 16:48.926
and she's agreed
to consider meeting with you.

16:48.926 --> 16:51.345
Wow! Your psychic has actually agreed

16:51.345 --> 16:55.224
to let me pay her a lot of money
to speak with her? Amazing.

16:55.224 --> 16:57.976
<i>Well, no. She's considering it.</i>

16:57.976 --> 17:00.896
<i>But I think you meeting
with Tish would be perfect because,</i>

17:00.896 --> 17:05.150
<i>well, you know, you are in desperate need
of some maternal guidance.</i>

17:05.150 --> 17:06.276
<i>Just a minute.</i>

17:06.276 --> 17:09.279
<i>There's a group of people
gathering outside for scream therapy,</i>

17:09.279 --> 17:11.365
<i>which is my favorite bit.</i>

17:11.365 --> 17:13.909
<i>So I'd better go now
because I mustn't use my voice.</i>

17:13.909 --> 17:16.203
- Bye-bye, sausage.
- But you called me.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.330
I have an update on the meeting with Zava.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.374
Great.

17:20.374 --> 17:23.252
- Zava doesn't want to meet with us.
- What? Why not?

17:23.252 --> 17:24.795
His people said,

17:24.795 --> 17:28.715
"It would be a waste of time
for us and an embarrassment for him."

17:29.383 --> 17:32.010
That feels like
an unnecessarily cruel response.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.471
But, good news,
Zava is signing with Chelsea.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.890
Why is that good news?

17:36.890 --> 17:38.559
Because he's not signing with West Ham.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.270
He came right out and said,
"I will not sign with West Ham."

17:41.270 --> 17:43.981
Shit. That's only going
to make Rupert want him more.

17:43.981 --> 17:45.607
There's nothing Rupert can do.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.733
Great. Now you've jinxed it.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.610
- But I thi--
- No, it's too late. Jinxed it.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.862
- But I do think that--
- It's done.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.072
Well done.

17:57.661 --> 17:58.662
Afternoon.

18:05.169 --> 18:06.295
Hi.

18:07.629 --> 18:08.797
Jamie.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.008
No. No.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.190
Looking good out there today.

18:33.655 --> 18:34.740
Cool.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.393
Thanks for sharing your office with me.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.771
Even if it was Ted's idea.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.017
So, Richmond against Chelsea?

19:44.518 --> 19:47.563
That will be your first time back there
since you retired. Right?

19:52.317 --> 19:53.318
Right.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.366
Sorry.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.662
Yeah, it's my publisher. I'll be quick.

20:04.538 --> 20:09.084
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no. Well, I'm here now.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.752
It's going very well, actually.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.796
I'm just getting settled in.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.049
Yes. Everyone's been...

20:16.967 --> 20:19.052
very welcoming.

20:19.636 --> 20:23.557
Yeah. No, I can hear that noise too.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.976
I'm not sure if that's my--
Is that me or you?

20:26.894 --> 20:29.062
Do you know what?
Bear with me. One moment.

20:29.730 --> 20:32.024
I'll take this outside.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.949
- Is this right?
- It is.

20:43.452 --> 20:46.079
Yes. Your company credit card arrived.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.372
Awesome. Thank you.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.708
- Do not use it.
- Okay.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.128
Barbara, I would love
for you to meet Shandy.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.922
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.548
She's the newest member of KJPR.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.846
What position has she been hired for?

21:04.640 --> 21:06.767
She will be consulting

21:07.935 --> 21:13.023
for affiliate management

21:13.732 --> 21:15.400
and...

21:16.235 --> 21:19.530
- client relationships.
- Yeah.

21:19.530 --> 21:21.240
Okay.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.867
Would you have a seat, Shandy?
Shandy, is it?

21:23.867 --> 21:25.869
- Yeah. Sorry.
- So, when I p--

21:25.869 --> 21:28.372
Yeah, just put it in there.
Put the sweet in there.

21:28.956 --> 21:34.169
Well, I'd love to know
what experience you have in these areas.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.839
In relationships, tons.

21:36.839 --> 21:38.257
The rest of it, not much.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.472
And where did you go to university?

21:46.807 --> 21:49.643
- I didn't go university.
- Didn't go?

21:49.643 --> 21:51.144
- No.
- Okay.

21:51.937 --> 21:54.606
And what were you doing right before this?

21:55.607 --> 21:56.650
I was modeling.

21:56.650 --> 22:00.487
Yeah. Okay, thanks, Shandy.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.738
All right. I think I've got it.

22:01.738 --> 22:05.409
So you've hired a former model
with no previous experience,

22:05.409 --> 22:09.538
no higher education for a job
that doesn't exist. Lovely.

22:12.165 --> 22:16.086
Well, welcome to the team, Shandy.

22:27.890 --> 22:30.601
I'm so sorry. I'll handle this.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.904
Barbara, I need a minute to talk with you.

22:43.906 --> 22:48.827
The way you just treated Shandy
was incredibly rude. It was hurtful.

22:51.788 --> 22:55.125
- What?
- That is a massive amount of snow globes.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.460
Yeah. I collect them.

22:57.503 --> 23:01.340
Well, you know, the firm sends me
from company to company,

23:01.340 --> 23:04.468
and, yeah, wherever I go,
I just buy a snow globe.

23:05.302 --> 23:06.929
It's a little bit silly, really.

23:06.929 --> 23:09.765
No, I think it's incredibly charming.

23:16.188 --> 23:19.191
You cannot speak to people like that.
Not here.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.237
I know Shandy's my friend,
and you're right.

23:23.237 --> 23:28.867
She does not have the experience. But she
is smart. She's eager. I believe in her.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.579
Like the firm must believe in you

23:32.579 --> 23:36.416
to send you all over the world
to all those lovely places, right?

23:42.005 --> 23:45.884
Maybe you and I can see how good it feels
to believe in someone else.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.470
Together. Yeah?

23:54.476 --> 23:57.145
Client relations coordinator.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.524
That's her title.

24:01.650 --> 24:05.863
Good. Yes.
Just in case you hadn't realized,

24:05.863 --> 24:08.407
I totally made up
that one I told you before.

24:10.534 --> 24:13.245
Hello. Hi.

24:16.665 --> 24:18.500
- Roy.
- No.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.460
I understand your hesitation
having me here.

24:20.460 --> 24:24.339
You're protective of the team,
and I admire how much they respect you.

24:24.339 --> 24:27.050
It's not easy getting such fulfillment
from a second career.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.677
I'm not sure I even got it from my first.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.891
Maybe you could just give me a chance.

24:36.852 --> 24:38.645
Fuck off.

24:43.358 --> 24:44.568
Wow, okay.

24:49.823 --> 24:53.243
<i>A new season begins
and hope springs eternal,</i>

24:53.243 --> 24:56.371
<i>except perhaps for AFC Richmond.</i>

24:56.371 --> 24:59.208
<i>They return to the Premier League
after a one-year absence</i>

24:59.208 --> 25:02.794
<i>but are widely expected to have
a rather short stay.</i>

25:03.295 --> 25:06.798
Worse yet, their campaign begins here
at Stamford Bridge,

25:06.798 --> 25:10.135
the home of the formidable
Chelsea Football Club.

25:10.135 --> 25:11.637
To be promoted to the Premier League

25:11.637 --> 25:14.014
is like going from a council estate
to the penthouse, Arlo.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.350
<i>Richmond should enjoy it while it lasts.</i>

25:16.350 --> 25:19.561
Gentlemen,
welcome back to the Premier League.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.563
Back where we belong. Pip pip.

25:22.439 --> 25:25.025
Feels like we never left.

25:25.609 --> 25:26.610
Here you go, lads.

25:27.736 --> 25:29.488
Mae. I got the fish and chips.

25:29.488 --> 25:30.697
I had the burger.

25:33.909 --> 25:35.619
It's good to be back.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.502
How's work? How's your friend doing?

25:43.502 --> 25:45.254
Shandy? Yeah, she's doing great.

25:45.921 --> 25:47.422
- Good.
- Yeah.

25:50.342 --> 25:52.177
She's just full of ideas.

25:52.177 --> 25:53.637
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Uh-oh.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.848
- Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me.
- Any news?

25:56.348 --> 25:58.350
Zava and Chelsea are pretty much
a done deal.

25:58.350 --> 26:01.645
I have the confirmation
of that from a very reliable source.

26:01.645 --> 26:02.771
What source?

26:02.771 --> 26:04.898
A friend of my wife knows an agent

26:04.898 --> 26:08.443
whose masseuse moonlights
as an airline steward on private jets.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.529
Now, she wasn't working today,

26:10.529 --> 26:12.906
but her coworker who can read lips,

26:12.906 --> 26:16.743
he saw Zava mouth the word "Chelsea"
a lot.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.745
- God, I wish I could read lips.
- Yeah.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.665
Okay. Has anyone seen Rupert?
Is there any sign of him?

26:21.665 --> 26:26.920
No, Rebecca. He's not here. And even
if he was, there's nothing he can do.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.547
Great. Jinxed it again.

26:34.887 --> 26:36.388
Fuck you, you old geezer.

26:38.098 --> 26:41.602
- Hello, Roy. Welcome back.
- How you doing, mate?

26:41.602 --> 26:43.312
Heard the news.

26:45.981 --> 26:47.024
I broke up with her.

26:47.024 --> 26:49.484
Why? I mean,
you guys were perfect together.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.570
Fuckin' Bruce.

26:51.570 --> 26:52.988
Oi, that's Roy Kent.

26:52.988 --> 26:55.073
- Roy!
- Roy Kent!

26:55.574 --> 26:57.117
We love you, Roy!

26:57.117 --> 26:59.661
He's here, he's there,
he's every fucking where,

26:59.661 --> 27:01.872
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!

27:01.872 --> 27:04.499
He's here, he's there,
he's every fucking where,

27:04.499 --> 27:10.047
Roy Kent, Roy Kent! He's here...

27:11.590 --> 27:13.133
<i>Now that's a lovely moment.</i>

27:13.133 --> 27:15.886
<i>Chelsea fans letting
their former captain, Roy Kent,</i>

27:15.886 --> 27:17.888
<i>know how they still feel about him.</i>

27:18.430 --> 27:21.517
Roy Kent, Roy Kent!

27:22.184 --> 27:24.853
He's here, he's there,
he's every fucking where,

27:24.853 --> 27:28.023
Roy Kent, Roy Kent...

27:41.828 --> 27:44.623
- Thank you.
- Oh, my gosh. Is that Zava?

27:44.623 --> 27:45.874
There he is.

27:45.874 --> 27:47.292
Look, it's Zava.

27:47.876 --> 27:49.753
Zava! Zava! Zava!

27:49.753 --> 27:51.839
<i>And the great Zava makes his appearance.</i>

27:51.839 --> 27:55.801
<i>Will he be signing for Chelsea today?
What are you hearing, Chris?</i>

27:55.801 --> 27:57.261
<i>All sorts of things.</i>

27:57.261 --> 28:00.931
<i>The crowd, your voice, a slight ringing
because I bumped my head earlier.</i>

28:02.558 --> 28:04.309
Holy--

28:07.187 --> 28:08.564
- Jamie.
- What?

28:09.147 --> 28:10.399
It's Zava.

28:11.066 --> 28:13.151
- So what, man?
- My heart is racing.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.028
I haven't been this nervous
to play in front of someone

28:15.028 --> 28:16.947
since I was in El Chapo's youth league.

28:17.656 --> 28:18.657
Move, man.

28:18.657 --> 28:20.868
Oh, my God. I cannot believe it.

28:22.870 --> 28:25.122
Wow, we're in the same city as Zava.

28:25.122 --> 28:26.748
Thank God we dressed up.

28:30.169 --> 28:33.213
<i>The players are in position,
awaiting the referee's whistle.</i>

28:33.213 --> 28:36.383
<i>And we're off. Another season begins.</i>

28:42.431 --> 28:44.183
Leslie, will you pull yourself together?

28:49.980 --> 28:52.941
<i>Hughes tries for Todd,
but Chelsea intercepts.</i>

28:52.941 --> 28:55.611
<i>The Greyhounds
are in massive jeopardy now.</i>

28:56.236 --> 29:00.616
<i>Some invention.
Look at that pace. High-pressure football.</i>

29:01.909 --> 29:03.410
- And Chelsea on the board...
- Fuck!

29:03.410 --> 29:04.912
- ...with beautiful counterattack...
- Shit.

29:04.912 --> 29:06.038
<i>...against a reeling Richmond.</i>

29:06.038 --> 29:07.956
No!

29:08.540 --> 29:09.833
<i>Absolutely devastating.</i>

29:09.833 --> 29:13.045
Take off those fucking hats.
They're bad luck.

29:13.045 --> 29:14.338
Same old shit.

29:15.297 --> 29:17.132
- The ref blows his whistle...
- It's all right.

29:17.132 --> 29:20.427
<i>...for the conclusion of the first half,
and it's Chelsea 1, Richmond nil.</i>

29:20.427 --> 29:23.764
<i>You have to give Richmond credit
for hanging on as long as they did, Arlo.</i>

29:26.475 --> 29:28.393
- That's beautiful.
- Yeah.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.149
What now?

29:35.067 --> 29:36.443
I might've jinxed it.

29:39.571 --> 29:40.572
I knew it.

29:42.324 --> 29:44.159
Would you please go and find out
as much as you can

29:44.159 --> 29:46.912
from your vast network
of lip-reading massage therapists?

29:46.912 --> 29:49.665
Okay. Pardon me. Excuse me.

29:49.665 --> 29:51.083
Excuse me. Pardon me.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.088
- Rupert's gonna land Zava.
- You don't know that.

29:57.965 --> 30:00.342
Years ago, when I was bartending
in that private club,

30:00.843 --> 30:03.512
Rupert and his then wife
came into the bar.

30:04.346 --> 30:06.473
He was the life and soul of the party.

30:06.473 --> 30:11.937
Buying rounds of drinks for everyone,
telling stories. Just charm personified.

30:11.937 --> 30:14.898
And he left me a massive tip.
And then about a week later,

30:14.898 --> 30:18.902
he came back without his wife
and asked me out.

30:18.902 --> 30:22.489
- I, of course, said no. Then he left.
- What a dick.

30:23.073 --> 30:26.618
But then he came back the next night
and the next night and the next.

30:26.618 --> 30:28.203
And he would just sit at the bar

30:28.203 --> 30:31.832
with a drink
and chatted to me until close.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.878
And he just said, "It doesn't matter
if you ever go out with me.

30:35.878 --> 30:38.338
It's just worth it being here
to get to know you."

30:39.548 --> 30:42.634
It's a fine line
between stalking and romance.

30:42.634 --> 30:47.556
And after about six weeks of that,
he asked me out again.

30:48.056 --> 30:52.519
And I said yes without any hesitation.

30:52.519 --> 30:53.770
Because by that point...

30:54.521 --> 30:57.816
I just felt so lucky because he wanted me.

31:00.110 --> 31:02.654
He made me feel special. Chosen.

31:06.116 --> 31:07.326
He made me feel like that.

31:22.674 --> 31:24.343
Hey, fellas. Listen up.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.554
We get one goal,
we're right back in this thing, yeah?

31:27.554 --> 31:29.389
But right now,
we are being so unoffensive,

31:29.389 --> 31:32.684
we might as well be a Hallmark Christmas
movie, you know what I'm saying?

31:32.684 --> 31:33.769
- What?
- What's that?

31:33.769 --> 31:35.687
I mean, Coach,
how many shots on goal we have that half?

31:35.687 --> 31:37.022
- One.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

31:37.022 --> 31:39.816
And that one was pretty much a mistake.
Am I correct, Dani?

31:39.816 --> 31:43.237
Yes, it bounced off my face.
But my face almost scored.

31:44.446 --> 31:45.864
Yes, it was close.

31:46.573 --> 31:48.158
- Coach.
- Yeah, Jamie.

31:48.158 --> 31:49.326
- One idea.
- What you got?

31:49.326 --> 31:51.954
Right, so every time they're going past
the halfway line, they're just--

32:02.756 --> 32:04.132
Trent, hold on a second.

32:05.384 --> 32:07.261
Roy, can I speak with you?

32:13.934 --> 32:16.562
Oi, what the fuck's
a Hallmark Christmas movie?

32:16.562 --> 32:19.106
Hey, look, man, I don't know
what your beef is with Trent,

32:20.023 --> 32:22.943
but I'm gonna need you to order off
the vegan menu right now and squash it.

32:24.236 --> 32:25.571
'Cause your ego's about to sabotage

32:25.571 --> 32:27.573
a whole lot more
than a silly football match.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.701
You feel me?

32:33.078 --> 32:34.121
Thank you.

32:35.998 --> 32:38.458
And Hallmark Christmas movies
are films that feature women

32:38.458 --> 32:41.044
from the big city falling in love
with their childhood crushes.

32:41.044 --> 32:43.672
It's usually some fella
that owns a Christmas tree farm.

32:43.672 --> 32:46.049
Sometimes he's also Santa Claus
or a prince.

32:47.342 --> 32:48.719
They suck, but they're great.

32:48.719 --> 32:50.345
But they also mostly suck.

32:50.929 --> 32:52.222
But they're also kinda great.

32:52.973 --> 32:54.391
They're good with the sound off.

32:55.976 --> 32:57.728
Now go fix this, please.

33:06.904 --> 33:07.946
Crimm!

33:24.296 --> 33:25.422
It's actually quite funny

33:25.422 --> 33:27.257
when he yells at other people, innit?

33:43.774 --> 33:44.942
Hold this.

33:53.283 --> 33:58.830
"Newcomer Roy Kent is an overhyped,
so-called prodigy

33:59.748 --> 34:02.960
whose unbridled rage and mediocre talent

34:03.794 --> 34:09.424
rendered his Premier League debut
a profound disappointment."

34:11.635 --> 34:12.844
Do you know who wrote that?

34:15.347 --> 34:17.683
I was 17 years old.

34:19.184 --> 34:21.103
This fucking wrecked me.

34:23.105 --> 34:25.065
I thought I was being edgy.

34:26.024 --> 34:28.235
I was just trying to make a name
for myself.

34:29.777 --> 34:34.992
All I really did was look
for the worst in people. I'm sorry.

34:38.203 --> 34:39.496
It's all right.

34:41.290 --> 34:42.416
Give me that.

34:46.170 --> 34:47.254
You know, it's funny.

34:48.255 --> 34:51.049
- We had a lot in common back then.
- We did?

34:51.049 --> 34:53.552
We both thought one another
sucked shit at their job.

34:55.012 --> 34:56.221
And now look at us.

34:58.682 --> 34:59.725
- Go.
- Yeah.

35:05.856 --> 35:07.191
Oi.

35:09.109 --> 35:10.736
You can talk around this prick now.

35:12.362 --> 35:14.031
Oi. Hold on, yo, yo, Jamie.
What were you saying?

35:14.031 --> 35:17.117
Yeah, man. Listen. What I'm saying is,
every time we go past halfway,

35:17.117 --> 35:19.703
they're just blocking up
the passing lanes, you get that?

35:19.703 --> 35:21.580
Yes, yes. That's right.
They're not marking us.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.123
So just keep dribbling
until they stop you.

35:23.123 --> 35:26.585
Exactly! Let's take it all the way
and fucking win this.

35:26.585 --> 35:28.295
Yes! Yeah!

35:31.507 --> 35:33.509
Thank you, thank you.

35:33.509 --> 35:34.760
Well?

35:34.760 --> 35:37.054
I just got off the phone
with my son's karate teacher,

35:37.054 --> 35:40.224
who used to date the woman
who ran Zava's avocado farm--

35:40.224 --> 35:44.019
- Would you please get on with it?
- He might be going to West Ham.

35:44.019 --> 35:45.521
- Shit.
- I knew it.

35:47.064 --> 35:48.899
Rupert always gets what he wants.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.281
You know what?

35:57.282 --> 36:00.536
If Rupert can sweet-talk Zava
into joining his club, then so can I.

36:01.245 --> 36:02.579
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

36:02.579 --> 36:03.872
Thank you. Sorry.

36:03.872 --> 36:05.415
<i>And we're back for the second half.</i>

36:05.415 --> 36:08.836
<i>Chris, do you think either of these teams
made any adjustments in the locker rooms?</i>

36:08.836 --> 36:10.754
<i>I'm sure they did, Arlo.</i>

36:10.754 --> 36:13.924
<i>But professional athletes don't mind
adjusting themselves in public either.</i>

36:18.971 --> 36:21.139
Hello there. Rebecca Welton, AFC Richmond.

36:21.139 --> 36:23.225
I'd love to see Zava. Thank you.

36:23.225 --> 36:25.185
No one gets in to see Zava.

36:25.769 --> 36:28.021
- I just saw Mr. Mannion--
- Rebecca, my dear.

36:29.982 --> 36:33.110
- Rupert. What a lovely surprise.
- Yeah.

36:35.195 --> 36:37.239
- There you go, Mr. Mannion.
- Thank you, Matthew.

36:39.032 --> 36:41.869
Congratulations, by the way,
on the win against Leicester yesterday.

36:41.869 --> 36:46.373
Thank you. Yeah. We are so lucky
to have a manager like Nathan.

36:46.373 --> 36:51.128
He's a gaffer who really understands
the game. Such an advantage.

36:55.382 --> 37:00.012
Zava. Let me introduce Rebecca Welton.
My ex-wife.

37:00.679 --> 37:02.431
And the owner of AFC Richmond.

37:02.431 --> 37:03.640
Yeah, of course.

37:04.391 --> 37:06.226
It's an honor for you to meet me.

37:08.312 --> 37:09.146
See you soon.

37:09.146 --> 37:10.397
Can't wait.

37:20.240 --> 37:23.577
He will look so great in claret and blue.

37:27.998 --> 37:29.750
You know, Rupert,
I was a little bit surprised

37:29.750 --> 37:31.793
when you bought West Ham.

37:31.793 --> 37:34.630
I always thought that Richmond
was your one true love.

37:35.631 --> 37:40.469
Guess I'm just like any man. Just get
bored with the same old, same old.

37:43.514 --> 37:45.015
Good luck with this season.

38:12.584 --> 38:15.879
You are such a fucking chickenshit.

38:16.547 --> 38:20.926
I mean, if you were great, truly great,
you could play anywhere.

38:20.926 --> 38:25.180
But instead you choose a club
like West Ham, because it's big and shiny,

38:25.180 --> 38:27.766
and you know that they'll win
whether you're there or not.

38:28.267 --> 38:30.227
And you'll never have to wonder

38:30.227 --> 38:33.021
if you're still as good as you tell
everyone you are.

38:34.690 --> 38:39.945
But you and I know that you're not.
You're overrated. You're overpaid.

38:42.614 --> 38:45.409
And you eat too much fucking asparagus.

38:51.957 --> 38:54.501
<i>Richmond's defending
has kept them in this match,</i>

38:54.501 --> 38:56.837
<i>and they are one moment
of inspiration away</i>

38:56.837 --> 38:59.423
<i>from going home with an unlikely point.</i>

38:59.423 --> 39:02.384
<i>Well, Chelsea giving Hughes space.</i>

39:02.384 --> 39:05.053
<i>If they're going to give him space,
he's going to take it.</i>

39:05.053 --> 39:08.015
<i>Possibilities here. Hughes has options.</i>

39:08.557 --> 39:10.517
<i>He slides it through to Tartt.</i>

39:11.101 --> 39:12.644
<i>Is this the moment?</i>

39:13.645 --> 39:15.564
<i>Obisanya's gonna have a go.</i>

39:17.316 --> 39:19.902
<i>It's in, off the face of Rojas!</i>

39:19.902 --> 39:21.737
- Absolutely brilliant.
- Yes!

39:21.737 --> 39:24.156
<i>In the blink of an eye.
Would you believe it?</i>

39:24.156 --> 39:26.742
<i>An historic goal, and it's 1-1.</i>

39:26.742 --> 39:30.162
My face scored a goal!
My face scored a goal!

39:30.829 --> 39:34.166
Chris, have you ever scored
with your face?

39:34.166 --> 39:38.128
I've scored with every part of my body,
Arlo. That's a ridiculous question.

39:39.505 --> 39:41.298
- That was amazing.
- Yeah, mate.

39:41.298 --> 39:42.758
Do you think Zava saw?

39:44.384 --> 39:45.594
Don't be a dick, man.

39:46.178 --> 39:47.179
Come on.

39:48.805 --> 39:50.349
Excuse me. Sorry.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.063
Oi, how'd it go?

39:56.063 --> 40:00.192
- Did you sweet-talk him?
- What's the opposite of that?

40:01.235 --> 40:02.361
Sour-yell.

40:03.195 --> 40:04.571
Yeah, I did that.

40:08.158 --> 40:10.911
<i>And Richmond managed to secure a 1-1 draw</i>

40:10.911 --> 40:13.413
<i>against Chelsea
in this gripping West London derby.</i>

40:13.413 --> 40:16.041
- There we go. There you go.
- They'll be leaving Stamford Bridge

40:16.041 --> 40:18.502
<i>with a well-deserved point on the table.</i>

40:23.882 --> 40:26.134
Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us.

40:26.134 --> 40:28.929
Obviously not the result
we were hoping for today.

40:28.929 --> 40:33.225
But I am certain
that this afternoon's announcement

40:33.225 --> 40:36.520
will raise every Chelsea fan's spirits.

40:36.520 --> 40:39.690
- Now, I know...
- Still think we need to get to the office.

40:40.232 --> 40:41.567
It won't be safe here.

40:41.567 --> 40:44.111
<i>Please welcome the newest member</i>

40:44.111 --> 40:46.446
of Chelsea Football Club.

40:47.030 --> 40:48.198
Zava.

40:52.661 --> 40:55.163
Welcome, Zava. Please take a seat.

40:56.665 --> 41:01.253
All right. You just sign.
And there's the pen.

41:04.131 --> 41:05.299
Please.

41:11.930 --> 41:15.309
I have changed my mind.
Zava will not play for Chelsea.

41:17.561 --> 41:19.438
Oh, God. I'm sorry. I can't watch this.

41:21.815 --> 41:23.442
Zava will play for Richmond.

41:29.740 --> 41:31.116
You twat!

41:33.368 --> 41:35.412
- May I keep the pen?
- Sure.

41:37.497 --> 41:38.498
What?

41:43.795 --> 41:45.422
What the fuck?

41:45.422 --> 41:46.757
- You did it.
- Yeah.

41:46.757 --> 41:48.467
- You did it!
- Oh, my God.

41:49.092 --> 41:51.595
Yo! We've got Zava.

41:51.595 --> 41:52.554
What?

41:52.554 --> 41:55.015
We've got Zava! Look!

41:55.849 --> 41:56.850
Shit!

42:02.856 --> 42:04.942
Fans are not gonna like this.

42:04.942 --> 42:10.781
Zava! We got you, Zava!
We got you, Zava! We got you, ra, ra, ra!

42:15.494 --> 42:17.329
- All right, man. Take care, man.
- Take care.

42:17.329 --> 42:19.414
- Zava is coming here.
- Zava.

42:34.888 --> 42:37.599
What you up to tonight, Coach?
You wanna race-walk home together?

42:38.100 --> 42:41.103
Can't. Jane and I are gonna go see
her friend's immersive theater show

42:41.103 --> 42:42.271
about the menstrual cycle.

42:44.648 --> 42:46.650
All right, well, I hope you're not late.

42:46.650 --> 42:48.360
Please tell Jane I said hello.

42:48.360 --> 42:52.030
I would, but she still finds
our relationship threatening.

42:54.324 --> 42:55.659
- Night, guys.
- Good night.

42:55.659 --> 42:56.785
Night, Coach.

42:57.452 --> 43:00.747
What do you say, Mr. Crimm?
Heck of a first week, yeah?

43:01.331 --> 43:02.374
And we've only just begun.

43:04.376 --> 43:06.086
- Good night.
- Night, Roy.

43:06.879 --> 43:10.340
Hey, Roy. I'm just curious,
what was it like being back at Chelsea?

43:10.340 --> 43:12.134
All them fans sure were happy to see you.

43:14.094 --> 43:20.017
I don't know. Just felt... sad.
Or something.

43:20.017 --> 43:21.852
Really? Why is that?

43:38.285 --> 43:42.539
Last season I was there,
we played a match against Arsenal,

43:43.540 --> 43:47.252
- and we fucking murdered 'em.
- I remember, 3-nil.

43:47.252 --> 43:48.670
Yeah.

43:50.464 --> 43:51.840
But I played like shit.

43:54.426 --> 43:55.636
Right?

43:59.806 --> 44:01.183
I did.

44:02.142 --> 44:05.312
That was the first time, ever, I thought,

44:06.688 --> 44:08.232
"I can't keep up anymore.

44:10.067 --> 44:11.485
I'm not good enough."

44:13.278 --> 44:17.449
And that was all I could think
about for the rest of the year.

44:18.992 --> 44:24.498
I knew it was only gonna get worse.
So at the end of the season, I left.

44:26.333 --> 44:32.256
Everyone was shocked.
The club was shocked. The fans. The press.

44:32.256 --> 44:33.632
Yeah.

44:34.424 --> 44:36.385
I didn't wanna be
one of them broken-down footballers

44:36.385 --> 44:38.720
just taking up space
until they're dropped,

44:39.221 --> 44:40.848
years after they should have been.

44:40.848 --> 44:44.810
Yeah, well, a lot of folks think it's
better to quit than to be fired, you know?

44:45.978 --> 44:46.979
Yeah.

44:49.648 --> 44:51.108
But going back there today...

44:54.194 --> 44:55.779
there's a part of me...

44:58.615 --> 45:00.200
thinking maybe I should have stayed...

45:02.452 --> 45:05.414
and just fucking...

45:07.749 --> 45:09.543
enjoyed myself.

45:16.592 --> 45:18.343
But that is not who I am,

45:19.553 --> 45:20.554
I guess.

45:22.514 --> 45:23.515
Not yet.

45:27.728 --> 45:30.981
But, hey, if you wouldn't have
left Chelsea when you did,

45:32.274 --> 45:33.859
we probably never would have met.

45:44.453 --> 45:46.079
- Good night.
- Good night.

45:47.206 --> 45:48.624
Good night, Roy.

45:53.003 --> 45:54.004
Sport.

45:55.088 --> 45:56.507
It's quite the metaphor.

45:56.507 --> 46:00.344
Yeah.
It also makes for a heck of a nickname.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.221
Yeah.

46:02.221 --> 46:04.348
- Night, Ted.
- Good night, sport.
