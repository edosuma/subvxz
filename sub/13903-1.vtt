WEBVTT

00:12.237 --> 00:14.197
Rush hour in London.

00:16.157 --> 00:18.197
HORN

00:18.197 --> 00:20.237
When work's over for everyone else,

00:20.237 --> 00:22.197
it's just starting for me.

00:25.837 --> 00:28.637
Aren't we all going through
the motions for money?

00:30.277 --> 00:32.717
Aren't we all whoring ourselves
for the man?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.917
Of course not.

00:38.917 --> 00:41.557
I'm literally whoring myself.
It's different.

00:46.597 --> 00:49.157
Welcome back. I missed you.

01:31.717 --> 01:35.157
I get a rush from this job that
I wouldn't get from a normal job.

01:35.157 --> 01:36.637
I have a number.

01:36.637 --> 01:39.277
A place to meet - the hotel bar.

01:39.277 --> 01:41.317
And a name.

01:41.317 --> 01:43.357
Alex.

01:43.357 --> 01:45.317
Anything could happen.

01:51.597 --> 01:53.517
All right?
Yes, thanks.

01:56.237 --> 01:58.277
Ahem. I'm Alex.

01:58.277 --> 02:00.237
Hi, I'm Belle!

02:01.237 --> 02:03.317
Would you like to buy me a drink?

02:03.317 --> 02:06.317
Absolutely. A glass of wine?
Whatever you're having.

02:06.317 --> 02:08.357
OK.

02:08.357 --> 02:10.317
A glass of the same, please.

02:11.797 --> 02:13.877
The envelope.

02:13.877 --> 02:16.477
Some men find it awkward
handing over money.

02:16.477 --> 02:20.677
They want it to feel like
a real date, so it's best
just to get it out of the way.

02:22.597 --> 02:24.637
There you go.
Thank you.

02:24.637 --> 02:27.197
No, no. I'm just over today
for the interview.

02:27.197 --> 02:29.277
I actually live in Dublin.

02:29.277 --> 02:31.357
And you're an anaesthetist. Wow.

02:31.357 --> 02:34.717
It's just a registrar position.
And you're staying here.

02:34.717 --> 02:39.117
They pay for the room
when you have the interview.
So I thought, "Make the most of it."

02:39.117 --> 02:41.037
Can I see it?

02:43.037 --> 02:44.997
Now?
Unless you'd rather not.

02:44.997 --> 02:47.597
No, no, no. I would love for you
to see my room.

02:47.597 --> 02:49.637
Good.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.597
BOTTLES

02:53.357 --> 02:55.317
Er...

02:56.797 --> 02:58.797
So... So what sort of thing
do you do?

02:59.917 --> 03:01.877
We'll talk about that in a minute.

03:07.597 --> 03:09.557
I'm just going to use your bathroom.

03:15.837 --> 03:17.797
(I am moving to fucking London!)

03:22.397 --> 03:24.797
I always run the tap
when I'm in the toilet.

03:24.797 --> 03:26.677
Don't want to ruin the mystique.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.517
Oh, and I never count the cash in
front of the clients. So impolite.

03:41.397 --> 03:42.837
(Fuck!)

03:42.837 --> 03:44.797
PHONE RINGS

03:50.677 --> 03:52.637
Fuck!

03:54.597 --> 03:56.597
Hello?
Hello, Belle.

03:56.597 --> 03:58.677
It's Alex.

03:58.677 --> 04:01.517
I don't know if there's been
some kind of problem.

04:01.517 --> 04:04.557
I remember telling you
to wait in the bar. Where are you?

04:06.437 --> 04:08.077
Hi.
Hey.

04:08.077 --> 04:10.837
Sorry. It's been nice.
Thanks for showing me your room.

04:10.837 --> 04:12.877
I'm afraid I have to...
See you later.

04:14.437 --> 04:16.476
Um... Er...
Bye.

04:16.476 --> 04:18.397
DOOR CLOSES
Bye.

04:19.517 --> 04:21.476
Wrong Alex. Shit!

04:22.437 --> 04:24.397
Wrong Alex.

04:28.997 --> 04:32.077
Belle, I take it.
I'm so sorry. Alex?

04:32.077 --> 04:34.037
Mm. Good evening.

04:37.477 --> 04:39.797
I thought you were meeting me
in the bar.

04:39.797 --> 04:42.597
I told you to wait in the bar
and I would be in touch.

04:42.597 --> 04:44.757
Sorry, there was a misunderstanding.

04:44.757 --> 04:46.837
I haven't got long.

04:46.837 --> 04:50.397
I'd like you to put that on and then
I'll go through what it is I'd like.

04:53.277 --> 04:55.397
# In the cool of the evening

04:55.397 --> 04:58.997
# When everything
is getting kind of groovy

05:02.357 --> 05:08.157
# You call me up and ask me if I'd
like to go with you and see a movie

05:11.477 --> 05:13.117
# First I say no

05:13.117 --> 05:15.157
# I've got some plans for tonight

05:15.157 --> 05:17.117
# And then I stop

05:18.277 --> 05:20.237
# And say all right #

05:27.557 --> 05:29.877
Sorry. I'm such a pillock!
I'm still lost!

05:31.237 --> 05:33.317
Are you sure you know
where you live?

05:33.317 --> 05:35.357
I'm sorry, you're too late.

05:35.357 --> 05:37.437
I might be able to do tomorrow.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.677
If you want to do this job,
you need to learn punctuality.

05:40.677 --> 05:42.677
I'm so sorry.
All right, bye.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.637
BUZZER

05:47.517 --> 05:52.037
Sometimes I get these emails
from women, asking if
they should become escorts.

05:52.037 --> 05:54.157
I don't know!
Make your own decisions.

05:55.197 --> 05:59.157
Hello, my name's Kai Felton
and you will want to hear
what I've got to say.

06:01.437 --> 06:03.517
I've no idea who this bloke is.

06:03.517 --> 06:06.277
Fair enough.
He is a Liberal Democrat, after all.

06:07.757 --> 06:09.837
I'm in a rush.

06:09.837 --> 06:13.117
I'll be quick. Â£15,000 for your
story. Depending on the details.

06:13.117 --> 06:17.917
I'm on my way out and I'm not happy
about some bloke turning up
and calling me a prostitute.

06:17.917 --> 06:20.477
I'm sure you like to think
of yourself as a call girl.

06:20.477 --> 06:23.517
Thanks! I'm sure you think
of yourself as a journalist.

06:25.277 --> 06:27.757
If you change your mind,
I'd appreciate it.

06:27.757 --> 06:30.197
Got the wrong girl, mate.
The amount is negotiable.

06:36.197 --> 06:38.517
In this job,
discretion is everything.

06:38.517 --> 06:40.957
I'm a firm believer
in having a private life.

06:44.597 --> 06:46.517
Where to, love?
Home.

06:53.557 --> 06:59.437
# And did those feet in ancient time

06:59.437 --> 07:04.957
# Walk upon
England's mountains green

07:04.957 --> 07:10.437
# And was the holy lamb of God #

07:11.437 --> 07:14.037
This is so typical.
She'll be here in a minute.

07:14.037 --> 07:15.997
Don't let it ruin your day.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.437
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,

07:21.437 --> 07:25.117
the love of God and
the fellowship of the Holy Spirit

07:25.117 --> 07:27.157
be with you all.

07:27.157 --> 07:29.237
ALL: And also with you.

07:29.237 --> 07:31.277
Sorry, Dad.
I told them you'd be late.

07:32.357 --> 07:34.437
Parents and godparents.

07:34.437 --> 07:36.717
The church receives this child
with joy.

07:38.037 --> 07:40.677
Following Christ means dying to sin

07:40.677 --> 07:42.637
and rising to new life with him.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.717
Therefore I ask...

07:45.717 --> 07:47.637
You made it!
(Sorry.)

07:51.117 --> 07:53.117
Divine intervention.

07:54.757 --> 07:58.837
Do you reject the devil
and all rebellion against God?

07:58.837 --> 08:00.797
I reject them.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.833
I reject them.

08:07.993 --> 08:10.833
Do you renounce the deceit
and corruption of evil?

08:13.353 --> 08:15.393
I renounce them.
I renounce them.

08:15.393 --> 08:18.913
Do you repent of the sins that
separate us from God and neighbour?

08:22.713 --> 08:24.673
Here we go.
Mm-hm.

08:34.273 --> 08:36.273
I repent of them.
I repent of them.

08:36.273 --> 08:38.313
Do you turn to Christ as saviour?

08:38.313 --> 08:40.273
PHONE RINGS

08:44.913 --> 08:46.913
That's probably Him now.

08:50.953 --> 08:52.913
I turn to Christ.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.597
And thanks to all of you
for coming out here today.

09:03.597 --> 09:05.837
Even those of you
who only just made it.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.037
Oh, no.
Actually, that's just Hannah.

09:08.037 --> 09:10.117
LAUGHTER

09:10.117 --> 09:13.957
Um... So, for those of you
wondering what this is,

09:13.957 --> 09:16.077
what we thought would be nice
is that

09:16.077 --> 09:22.077
each of these petals represents the
hopes and dreams for our baby Ollie.

09:22.077 --> 09:26.477
So if you have any sort of wish
or thought for his future,

09:26.477 --> 09:28.637
we'd like you to come over later

09:28.637 --> 09:30.677
and take one of the petals

09:30.677 --> 09:32.637
and drop it into the crib.

09:38.757 --> 09:40.797
ALL: Aaah.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.877
OK, everyone.

09:42.877 --> 09:45.397
Enjoy the food and drink
and the decorations!

09:50.997 --> 09:53.117
Did that make you want to throw up?
Ben!

09:53.117 --> 09:55.077
I didn't know you were coming.

09:55.077 --> 09:57.637
We're only round the corner now,
aren't we?

09:57.637 --> 09:59.637
Hello!
Hello, dear.

09:59.637 --> 10:01.597
Oh, look at you! You're so thin!

10:03.757 --> 10:05.877
Is this your boyfriend?

10:05.877 --> 10:08.157
This is my friend Ben.
Hi, Auntie Bloss.

10:08.157 --> 10:10.117
Oh, you used to be her boyfriend.

10:11.637 --> 10:13.717
Yeah, a long time ago.

10:13.717 --> 10:16.877
I'm just going over there.
Won't be a second. Excuse me.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.197
Look at her. She could be a model,
that one.

10:19.197 --> 10:21.237
In one of those catalogues.

10:21.237 --> 10:23.317
Yeah, she could.

10:23.317 --> 10:25.437
I don't buy from catalogues
any more.

10:25.437 --> 10:27.477
No, me neither.

10:27.477 --> 10:29.437
They're all owned by Jews.

10:32.837 --> 10:35.837
I seem to find social gatherings
harder than I used to.

10:35.837 --> 10:37.917
People talk about two things.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.837
Relationships, which I avoid
for obvious reasons.

10:40.837 --> 10:42.877
Or work.

10:42.877 --> 10:44.837
Which I avoid for obvious reasons.

10:47.597 --> 10:49.917
Who knows?
Maybe I should have told them.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.877
Maybe they'd be fine with it.

10:53.397 --> 10:55.397
You didn't bring anyone, then?
No.

10:55.397 --> 10:57.437
You know what it's like, Dad.

10:57.437 --> 10:59.477
Relationships, prostitution.

10:59.477 --> 11:01.517
Yeah, yeah, of course.

11:01.517 --> 11:03.557
Is there much money in that, then?

11:03.557 --> 11:05.037
Hm!

11:05.037 --> 11:07.637
Do you kiss on the mouth, then?
Yeah, of course.

11:07.637 --> 11:09.717
That's just a myth.

11:09.717 --> 11:11.837
I can recite the whole
of Pretty Woman.

11:12.677 --> 11:14.557
I said I'm a prostitute, Auntie!

11:14.557 --> 11:17.517
I heard you the first time, dear.

11:17.517 --> 11:20.677
We've all had our fair share
of cock.

11:20.677 --> 11:22.477
It's nothing to shout about.

11:24.357 --> 11:26.317
Yeah, maybe not.

11:37.757 --> 11:39.797
How's life in the home counties?

11:39.797 --> 11:41.757
Good, actually.

11:42.637 --> 11:45.597
How's prostitution?
Yeah, the same old.

11:48.757 --> 11:50.797
I'm going in a bit.
Why?

11:50.797 --> 11:53.317
I promised Vanessa
I wouldn't stay too long.

11:53.317 --> 11:55.357
(WHIP CRACKING)

11:55.357 --> 11:57.317
Fuck off. I cancelled our wedding.

11:58.877 --> 12:00.877
She's entitled
to be pissed off with me.

12:00.877 --> 12:02.837
And to insist you move out of London.

12:06.437 --> 12:08.437
Want a lift later?
No, it's all right.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.837
You're going
in the opposite direction.

12:11.837 --> 12:14.157
I can see what you did there!
Nice, subtle.

12:15.437 --> 12:17.557
Come on.
They're about to do the thing.

12:21.277 --> 12:23.517
(Here we go.
Trying to be fairy godmother.)

12:41.317 --> 12:44.837
The thing is, you've shattered
their child's hopes and dreams.

12:55.237 --> 12:57.197
Oh, shit.

13:01.677 --> 13:04.317
Mate, can we go through
Central London, please?

13:11.397 --> 13:13.317
Hi!
Hello.

13:15.997 --> 13:17.957
I was just returning this.

13:19.437 --> 13:21.637
Thank God.
I thought I was going mad.

13:21.637 --> 13:23.557
I didn't know if you'd still be here.
They -

13:23.557 --> 13:26.157
I can't really go anywhere
without this, can I?

13:27.637 --> 13:30.357
I'm so sorry. I didn't even know
it was in my bag.

13:30.357 --> 13:32.957
It's OK. I was on my way
to the passport office.

13:32.957 --> 13:34.997
No! Oh.

13:34.997 --> 13:36.957
It's a relief. Thank you.

13:38.237 --> 13:40.197
Forgive me for saying this, but...

13:41.157 --> 13:43.477
You're off your fucking nuts,
aren't you?

13:44.437 --> 13:46.477
No. Well... Maybe.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.517
I don't know. I've um...

13:48.517 --> 13:50.477
I've had a really weird day.

13:51.677 --> 13:53.797
Do you want to go for a drink?

13:53.797 --> 13:55.637
I've changed my flight
till tomorrow.

13:55.637 --> 13:57.877
I don't think so.
I've got a taxi waiting.

13:59.437 --> 14:01.517
Give me your number.

14:01.517 --> 14:04.957
Just in case you've stolen something
else while we've been talking.

14:04.957 --> 14:07.397
Look, you've inconvenienced me.
You owe me.

14:08.437 --> 14:10.397
There.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.797
Hannah.
I thought your name was Belle.

14:25.797 --> 14:27.877
Oh, yeah. That's...

14:27.877 --> 14:30.197
That's what my friends call me
because...

14:30.197 --> 14:32.237
That's...

14:32.237 --> 14:34.197
my nickname.

14:35.357 --> 14:37.437
Bye.

14:37.437 --> 14:39.357
Bye.
Bye.

14:50.597 --> 14:52.877
I just wanted to get your advice
really.

14:52.877 --> 14:57.197
Like I said in my emails,
I've been thinking about
getting into it for ages.

14:57.197 --> 15:01.797
I've done a bit in films.
My brother's friend, in this
porn film thing that he did.

15:01.797 --> 15:03.917
Right.
I love your website by the way.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.997
You're so clever and sorted.

15:05.997 --> 15:08.837
I should say that, obviously,
there are downsides.

15:09.957 --> 15:12.037
Relationships become impossible.

15:12.037 --> 15:15.037
You work strange hours.
You lie to people all the time.

15:15.157 --> 15:17.197
I do that anyway.

15:17.197 --> 15:19.237
Oh, I've come up with a name.

15:19.237 --> 15:21.317
I want to be called...Bambi.

15:21.317 --> 15:23.837
That's what people
used to call me in school.

15:23.837 --> 15:26.077
Bambi. Right, because you're quite...

15:26.077 --> 15:27.357
Doe-eyed?

15:27.357 --> 15:29.317
No, it's because my mum got shot.

15:31.757 --> 15:34.077
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I'm only joking!

15:34.077 --> 15:36.037
(LAUGHS)

15:37.917 --> 15:39.957
Why do you want to escort, Bambi?

15:39.957 --> 15:41.997
Money. What about you?

15:41.997 --> 15:44.037
What about me, what?

15:44.037 --> 15:46.117
Why?

15:46.117 --> 15:48.117
Well, er...
Sorry, ladies.

15:48.117 --> 15:50.077
Can I have a word?

15:59.077 --> 16:01.117
This is me going to a christening.

16:01.117 --> 16:03.197
Well, it's out of my hands now.

16:03.197 --> 16:05.317
My editor wants to print the story
tomorrow.

16:05.317 --> 16:07.837
That Farringdon's had escorts
up to his room.

16:07.837 --> 16:11.717
But, and this is being generous,
I can get you twenty for your side
of the story.

16:11.717 --> 16:14.357
Have you been following me?
We can show him for what he is.

16:14.357 --> 16:17.117
A hypocrite. And it will be
all sympathy for you.

16:17.117 --> 16:20.957
All from your point of view. The
things that forced you into...this.

16:20.957 --> 16:22.997
Oh, really?
Yeah. People like it.

16:22.997 --> 16:26.957
Paying your way through university.
I've been to fucking university.

16:26.957 --> 16:29.237
Where you learnt
such pretty language.

16:29.237 --> 16:31.197
PHONE RINGS

16:37.717 --> 16:39.677
Hi, Belle's phone.

16:40.517 --> 16:42.517
Oh, I don't know. Hang on.

16:48.117 --> 16:51.957
Hi, this is Bambi. I'm taking care
of Belle's clients while she's away.

16:53.397 --> 16:56.797
I'm giving you a chance. "He made me
do this, he made me do that."

16:56.797 --> 17:00.517
My editor wants to run this photo
of you. It's going to be out
tomorrow anyway.

17:00.517 --> 17:02.677
Be in control of it.
You're a clever girl.

17:03.917 --> 17:05.957
Yeah, sure. That's fine, David.

17:05.957 --> 17:07.916
OK, see you tomorrow.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.916
Are you all right? What's going on?

17:29.557 --> 17:32.757
TV: We must look forward,
not backwards as the Tories are.

17:32.757 --> 17:36.717
The Liberal Democrats
are the only party
who are embracing a new Britain.

17:36.717 --> 17:39.397
I want to lead that party
into the next decade.

17:39.397 --> 17:43.717
When a scandal breaks,
everyone thinks about
the celebrity being exposed.

17:43.717 --> 17:47.437
They don't really think about
the woman and what it means for her.

17:47.437 --> 17:50.237
This government has got to go
straight into the bin.

17:51.597 --> 17:53.597
PHONE RINGS

17:56.917 --> 17:58.877
Hello.
Hannah, it's Alex.

18:00.517 --> 18:02.437
Oh, hello.
Is this a bad time?

18:03.997 --> 18:06.037
Er... No, no. How are you?

18:07.077 --> 18:09.157
I'm great. I'm great.

18:09.157 --> 18:11.517
I got that job.
Decided to move to London.

18:11.517 --> 18:13.517
Did you? That's great.
Yeah.

18:13.517 --> 18:15.557
How are you?

18:15.557 --> 18:17.517
Yeah, you know...

18:19.197 --> 18:21.237
What have you been up to?

18:21.237 --> 18:23.317
I...

18:23.317 --> 18:25.917
I went to a christening.
Really? That's nice.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.957
Not really. I pissed my sister off.

18:27.957 --> 18:30.037
Sisters. Fuck 'em.

18:30.037 --> 18:32.757
Send her some flowers.
Sisters love that shit.

18:32.757 --> 18:35.237
Interflora saved my life
a thousand times.

18:35.237 --> 18:37.317
OK, maybe I will.

18:37.317 --> 18:41.317
Um... I was wondering if you wanted
to go for a drink some time.

18:41.317 --> 18:43.357
Er...

18:43.357 --> 18:45.397
Well, you've got my number now.

18:45.397 --> 18:47.437
Alex, I don't really know.

18:47.437 --> 18:49.517
OK.

18:49.517 --> 18:52.237
Why don't you see
if you still want to tomorrow?

18:52.237 --> 18:54.557
(LAUGHS)
Why, what's going on tomorrow?

18:54.557 --> 18:56.517
Just ring me if you still want to.

18:59.117 --> 19:01.077
Bye.

19:48.757 --> 19:50.797
DOORBELL

19:50.797 --> 19:52.757
Patrick! Will you get the paper?

19:53.717 --> 19:55.637
Yes, love.

20:02.637 --> 20:04.717
Jackie, come and look at this!
What?

20:04.717 --> 20:06.677
Your sister.

20:14.037 --> 20:15.917
She got you these.

20:23.957 --> 20:26.157
They found someone else.
Unbelievable.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.597
You're never entirely safe
in this job.

20:34.557 --> 20:38.237
If there's no story today, who's to
say there won't be one tomorrow?

20:39.757 --> 20:44.517
There's more than the obvious danger
of walking into a room
with a man you don't know.

20:44.517 --> 20:49.037
There's the danger
of two carefully constructed lives
crashing into each other.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.677
Hello.
Hannah.

21:03.677 --> 21:05.757
It's Alex.

21:05.757 --> 21:08.637
These days, I can get ready
for a client in my sleep.

21:08.637 --> 21:10.717
They like big hair, big breasts.

21:10.717 --> 21:13.197
Gives you some idea
of where the incisions will be.

21:13.197 --> 21:15.277
And a big smile.

21:15.277 --> 21:17.797
What do you do?
But you can't fake everything.
