(golf club swinging)
(whimsical music)

00:07.219 --> 00:10.302
(upbeat piano music)

00:19.806 --> 00:21.472
- Oh, hey there.

00:21.472 --> 00:23.024
I'm on my way to the golf course.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.902
Golf is a funny game.

00:24.902 --> 00:27.170
Whether people play it
or not, love it or not,

00:27.170 --> 00:28.943
they usually have an opinion about it.

00:28.943 --> 00:31.720
And it's probably the only
sport where people will go

00:31.720 --> 00:34.002
out of their way to tell
you they suck at it.

00:34.002 --> 00:38.291
Talk about other sports and
you'll hear things like-

00:38.291 --> 00:41.291
- I love tennis, such good exercise.

00:42.127 --> 00:45.151
- Baseball, nothin' like
a day at the ballpark.

00:45.151 --> 00:46.028
(baseball cracking)

00:46.028 --> 00:48.778
(crowd cheering)

00:50.263 --> 00:53.011
- Hockey is so fast and exciting.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.111
- [Rick] But mention golf and you'll hear-

00:55.111 --> 00:56.577
- I suck at golf.

00:56.577 --> 00:57.579
- Golf?

00:57.579 --> 00:59.013
I suck at golf.

00:59.013 --> 01:00.727
- I suck at golf.

01:00.727 --> 01:01.828
- I suck at golf.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.245
- I suck at golf.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.698
- I suck at golf.

01:05.698 --> 01:08.449
- I really, really suck at golf.

01:08.449 --> 01:09.929
- I suck at golf.

03:31.918 --> 03:33.099
- You, Dick.

03:33.099 --> 03:34.147
- [Rick] It's Rick.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.397
- Where all the pop cans?

03:35.397 --> 03:36.869
- They're in the recycling bin.

03:36.869 --> 03:37.799
- Why are they there?

03:37.799 --> 03:39.271
- Because they're empty.

03:39.271 --> 03:41.025
- Pop cans don't go in recycling.

03:41.025 --> 03:41.858
- They don't?

03:41.858 --> 03:43.367
- No, they go in these plastic bags,

03:43.367 --> 03:45.096
and then we, and by we I mean you,

03:45.096 --> 03:47.317
take 'em to the store for a refund.

03:47.317 --> 03:48.214
- Holy.

03:48.214 --> 03:49.047
- It's not for me.

03:49.047 --> 03:51.204
It's for the junior program.
- Okay, gotcha.

03:51.204 --> 03:52.548
- Okay, go on.
(phone ringing)

03:52.548 --> 03:54.149
Actually, give me that.

03:54.149 --> 03:56.120
You answer the phone.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.953
- Woodlands Golf Club.

03:58.838 --> 04:01.304
You'd like a tee time tomorrow?

04:01.304 --> 04:03.429
What time would you like?

04:03.429 --> 04:05.607
Between nine and 9:30?

04:05.607 --> 04:06.440
Let's see.

04:07.439 --> 04:08.522
Wide open.

04:08.522 --> 04:10.868
You can have your pick.

04:10.868 --> 04:13.249
You can have anything.

04:13.249 --> 04:15.416
Nine to 9:30 is wide open.

04:18.779 --> 04:22.446
There are no bookings
between nine and 9:30.

04:23.707 --> 04:26.773
Yes, I know you said
between nine and 9:30.

04:26.773 --> 04:30.273
I'm saying, oh never mind, how about 9:15?

04:31.393 --> 04:32.650
Earlier?

04:32.650 --> 04:33.900
How about 9:08?

04:35.229 --> 04:37.236
Nine o'clock maybe?

04:37.236 --> 04:38.486
Still too late?

04:39.851 --> 04:40.780
(sighing)

04:40.780 --> 04:42.648
I've got 8:52.

04:42.648 --> 04:44.052
Perfect?

04:44.052 --> 04:44.885
Thank God.

04:45.732 --> 04:46.609
What?

04:46.609 --> 04:49.038
Oh, I said that's mod.

04:49.038 --> 04:49.983
Okay?

04:49.983 --> 04:51.262
See you tomorrow.

04:51.262 --> 04:52.816
Goodbye.

04:52.816 --> 04:55.406
(phone ringing)
Woodlands Golf Club.

04:55.406 --> 04:56.718
- Hi, is this Rick?

04:56.718 --> 04:57.646
- [Rick] Yes, it is.

04:57.646 --> 04:59.760
- Hi, Rick, it's Bogart here.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.268
Listen, I'm running a little late.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.826
Are you still able to get me off early?

05:02.826 --> 05:04.488
- Yeah, sure.

05:04.488 --> 05:05.848
Is this Mr. Humphries?

05:05.848 --> 05:09.106
- I've told you before
Rick, call me Bogart,

05:09.106 --> 05:10.559
and I'll see you very soon.

05:10.559 --> 05:14.096

(clubs clinking)

05:51.846 --> 05:55.013
(trunk door slamming)

06:02.020 --> 06:05.270
- Buy yourself a sandwich or something.

06:08.549 --> 06:10.283
(birds chirping)

06:10.283 --> 06:11.599
Hey, Rick, I'm here.

06:11.599 --> 06:12.962
- You're on the tee, Mr. Humphries.

06:12.962 --> 06:13.960
- Bogart.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.877
- Mr. Bogart.
- Thanks.

06:17.448 --> 06:18.281
- Sorry.

06:24.798 --> 06:27.631
(whimsical music)

06:34.302 --> 06:36.248
(phone ringing)
- Woodlands Golf Club.

06:36.248 --> 06:37.788
- Hey Rick, it's Bogart.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.431
There's no one else here.

06:39.431 --> 06:41.529
- You're just a onesome, Mr. Bogart.

06:41.529 --> 06:42.758
- [Bogart] A onesome?

06:42.758 --> 06:44.086
- Yes, I'm very sorry.

06:44.086 --> 06:45.572
It's just a quiet afternoon.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.762
There's no one following you.

06:46.762 --> 06:48.077
Maybe play two balls.

06:48.077 --> 06:49.842
- Well, that's a splendid idea.

06:49.842 --> 06:51.032
Thanks for all you do, Rick.

06:51.032 --> 06:52.311
- Oh, you're very welcome, Mr.,

06:52.311 --> 06:53.478
I mean Bogart.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.988
- Who's that jackass on the first tee?

06:55.988 --> 06:57.580
- That's Bogart.
- Bogart?

06:57.580 --> 06:58.575
- Mr. Humphries.

06:58.575 --> 07:00.380
- He just handed me five bucks.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.920
- He's a very nice man.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.228
- Why did he hand me five bucks?

07:03.228 --> 07:04.108
- Like I said-

07:04.108 --> 07:05.718
- He's a very nice man.

07:05.718 --> 07:07.840
Who I bet I can't play golf for shit.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.673
(whimsical music)

08:12.320 --> 08:14.052
- Oh, sorry.

08:14.052 --> 08:15.049
Sorry.

08:15.049 --> 08:17.341
- And with mismatched golf shoes.

08:17.341 --> 08:20.019
(whimsical music)

08:20.019 --> 08:21.962
- Let's give this another shot.

08:21.962 --> 08:23.502
(whimsical music)

08:23.502 --> 08:24.465
That was a little better.

08:24.465 --> 08:27.298
(whimsical music)

08:37.417 --> 08:38.250
Afternoon.

08:39.181 --> 08:42.014
(whimsical music)

08:57.960 --> 09:00.710
(birds chirping)

09:05.074 --> 09:06.688
(whimsical music)

09:06.688 --> 09:09.657
- [Rick] People suck at golf
for a variety of reasons,

09:09.657 --> 09:12.776
but one of them is just arriving too late.

09:12.776 --> 09:14.609
I see it all day long.

09:19.591 --> 09:21.673
- (sighing) How's the tee sheet lookin'?

09:21.673 --> 09:22.859
- Super dead.

09:22.859 --> 09:23.883
Two twosomes in an hour

09:23.883 --> 09:27.283
and then a foursome
about an hour after that.

09:27.283 --> 09:28.784
Not good, is it?

09:28.784 --> 09:31.604
- Oh, it's great if you want
the golf course to yourself

09:31.604 --> 09:32.985
for a leisurely round.

09:32.985 --> 09:35.505
Not so great if you'd been hired
to increase rounds of play.

09:35.505 --> 09:37.134
- Maybe it's the weather?

09:37.134 --> 09:38.182
- The weather's perfect.

09:38.182 --> 09:39.201
- Perfect for the beach.

09:39.201 --> 09:40.790
Maybe everyone's gone to the beach.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.034
A little rain might help.

09:42.034 --> 09:44.100
- Oh rain, that's all I need.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.359
- [Rick] It's not that bad.

09:45.359 --> 09:46.565
- It is that bad.

09:46.565 --> 09:48.665
If we don't hit 50,000 rounds this year

09:48.665 --> 09:50.681
this place gets turned into a park.

09:50.681 --> 09:51.554
- Seriously?

09:51.554 --> 09:52.431
- Yep.

09:52.431 --> 09:53.671
Council doesn't like golf.

09:53.671 --> 09:56.123
They're looking for an excuse
to shut this place down

09:56.123 --> 09:58.904
and turn it into a park
that everyone can enjoy.

09:58.904 --> 10:00.043
- Oh.

10:00.043 --> 10:02.861
- Yeah, so don't even
talk to me about rain.

10:02.861 --> 10:03.992
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat

10:03.992 --> 10:05.883
and then I'm gonna take
those cans to the store.

10:05.883 --> 10:06.716
- Okay.

10:10.503 --> 10:11.924
- Welcome to Woodlands Golf Club.

10:11.924 --> 10:13.464
(girls chuckling)

10:13.464 --> 10:14.462
Is that funny?

10:14.462 --> 10:15.948
- Well, we come here all the time.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.417
You don't always have to say,

10:17.417 --> 10:18.376
"Welcome to Woodlands Golf Club."

10:18.376 --> 10:20.712
(Sally giggling)
- Actually I do.

10:20.712 --> 10:21.846
I'm sorry.

10:21.846 --> 10:23.370
- Don't be sorry.

10:23.370 --> 10:24.645
- [Rick] How can I help you?

10:24.645 --> 10:25.711
- We want to play golf.

10:25.711 --> 10:26.854
- When?

10:26.854 --> 10:28.324
- Today.

10:28.324 --> 10:29.252
- [Rick] When today?

10:29.252 --> 10:30.441
- How about now?

10:30.441 --> 10:31.334
- [Rick] Now?

10:31.334 --> 10:33.732
- Yes, now or soon.

10:33.732 --> 10:35.725
Look on the little tee
sheet with your eyes

10:35.725 --> 10:38.070
and see if there's an
opening for now or soon.

10:38.070 --> 10:38.903
- Okay.

10:40.065 --> 10:43.215
Says here there's an
opening for quarter past now

10:43.215 --> 10:44.404
or soon 30.

10:44.404 --> 10:46.925
(girls giggling)

10:46.925 --> 10:48.735
- So?
- So what?

10:48.735 --> 10:49.928
- Can we play golf?

10:49.928 --> 10:51.454
- Yeah, the tee's all yours.

10:51.454 --> 10:53.550
- Oh, and I want a golf ball.

10:53.550 --> 10:54.825
- They're $3 each.

10:54.825 --> 10:56.158
- I think I want

10:57.313 --> 10:58.856
that one.

10:58.856 --> 11:00.148
- They're all Titleists.

11:00.148 --> 11:01.981
- No, I want that one.

11:03.123 --> 11:04.404
- [Rick] But they're all the same.

11:04.404 --> 11:07.904
- No, this one's a seven
and seven's my lucky number.

11:07.904 --> 11:09.165
- It is?
- It is.

11:09.165 --> 11:10.804
Isn't seven my lucky number?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.716
- Seven is her lucky number.

11:12.716 --> 11:14.513
- Surely there must be another seven.

11:14.513 --> 11:17.355
- Probably, but do you want
to look through all of them

11:17.355 --> 11:20.022
when we know this one's a seven?

11:21.084 --> 11:21.917
Do you?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.322
- Okay.

11:24.322 --> 11:27.300
- Would you be a dear and grab it for me?

11:27.300 --> 11:30.291
(golf balls crashing)

11:30.291 --> 11:33.124
(whimsical music)

11:35.999 --> 11:38.915
(leaves crunching)

11:59.830 --> 12:02.580
(birds chirping)

12:08.879 --> 12:13.879
(golf ball cracking)
(phone ringing)

12:26.437 --> 12:28.187
- Gotta be 200 yards.

12:29.060 --> 12:31.727
(phone ringing)

12:43.155 --> 12:45.988
(grass crunching)

12:47.929 --> 12:50.596
(phone ringing)

12:54.126 --> 12:54.959
Hello?

12:56.380 --> 12:57.659
What?

12:57.659 --> 12:58.492
Now?

12:59.745 --> 13:01.526
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry.

13:01.526 --> 13:02.943
I totally forgot.

13:03.977 --> 13:06.815
Can you wait like half an hour?

13:06.815 --> 13:08.405
You can.

13:08.405 --> 13:09.766
Great.

13:09.766 --> 13:10.933
I'm on my way.

13:11.887 --> 13:16.197
Oh, and you're not billing
me for waiting are you?

13:16.197 --> 13:17.030
Mmmm,

13:18.615 --> 13:20.782
30 minutes, I can do this.

13:23.725 --> 13:27.225
(upbeat bluegrass music)

14:07.899 --> 14:10.732
(whimsical music)

14:29.249 --> 14:32.974
- Hey Siri, get directions
to the nearest gas station.

14:32.974 --> 14:35.535
- [Siri] There's a bus station
at Main and Marine Drive.

14:35.535 --> 14:36.879
Is that the one you're looking for?

14:36.879 --> 14:38.908
- No gas station.

14:38.908 --> 14:41.065
- [Siri] There's another at
Third Street and Commercial.

14:41.065 --> 14:42.756
It's open today.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.055
Is that the one-
- Hey Siri, cancel.

14:45.055 --> 14:46.315
- [Siri] Okay.

14:46.315 --> 14:49.127
- Hey Siri, get walking directions

14:49.127 --> 14:51.299
to the Chevron nearest me.

14:51.299 --> 14:54.376
- [Siri] There's a Chevron
at 1472 Marine Drive,

14:54.376 --> 14:56.409
about one kilometer to yourself.

14:56.409 --> 14:57.702
It gets two stars.

14:57.702 --> 14:59.265
Is that the one you're looking for?

14:59.265 --> 15:00.098
- Yes.

15:00.996 --> 15:03.329
- [Siri] Getting directions.

15:19.457 --> 15:21.624
- People are unbelievable.

15:30.922 --> 15:31.755
- Is that?

15:33.568 --> 15:34.771
Poor fellow.

15:34.771 --> 15:35.948
So sad.

15:35.948 --> 15:38.781
(whimsical music)

15:48.607 --> 15:51.930
(car honking)

15:51.930 --> 15:53.525
(knocking on door)

15:53.525 --> 15:54.697
I'm so sorry I'm late.

15:54.697 --> 15:56.937
I must admit, I totally forgot.

15:56.937 --> 15:59.056
My brain has been a bit off lately.

15:59.056 --> 16:01.347
- Totally understand.

16:01.347 --> 16:03.816
The papers are waiting for
you to sign right there.

16:03.816 --> 16:05.705
And I'm sorry to move
things along so quickly,

16:05.705 --> 16:07.747
but I have a tee time.

16:07.747 --> 16:08.819
- Oh, that's my fault.

16:08.819 --> 16:10.149
I'm so sorry.

16:10.149 --> 16:12.687
- The yellow arrows are where you sign.

16:12.687 --> 16:13.560
- All right.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.946
So whereabouts do you play?

16:14.946 --> 16:15.796
- The Hennessy Golf Club.

16:15.796 --> 16:16.674
I'm a member there.

16:16.674 --> 16:18.158
- Oh, that's a nice little track.

16:18.158 --> 16:19.686
- Not for long, unfortunately.

16:19.686 --> 16:20.909
- [Bogart] Oh no.

16:20.909 --> 16:22.710
- Well it's on leased land.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.166
- Oh.

16:24.166 --> 16:24.999
Last one.

16:27.106 --> 16:27.939
There we go.
- All done?

16:27.939 --> 16:29.171
- [Bogart] All done.

16:29.171 --> 16:30.921
- [Redman] Thank you.

16:32.428 --> 16:35.178
(stamp clicking)

16:39.671 --> 16:41.911
You're officially divorced.

16:41.911 --> 16:43.138
- It feels a bit odd.

16:43.138 --> 16:45.887
- Well, I must say I'm
a little numb these days

16:45.887 --> 16:49.961
when it comes to this, but divorce is odd.

16:49.961 --> 16:52.395
But, you know, you have to
think of the brighter side.

16:52.395 --> 16:54.028
You are winding up with the house.

16:54.028 --> 16:56.056
- Yeah, but she gets the other house

16:56.056 --> 16:57.306
and the cottage

16:58.489 --> 17:01.238
and the boat and the Mercedes

17:01.238 --> 17:03.071
and the pension and...

17:21.452 --> 17:24.285
(whimsical music)

17:26.278 --> 17:28.840
- Hey Ray, did you run out of gas?

17:28.840 --> 17:29.834
- No flies on you.

17:29.834 --> 17:30.739
- You really did.

17:30.739 --> 17:31.612
- I sure did.

17:31.612 --> 17:32.887
- Oh, are you very far from here?

17:32.887 --> 17:34.520
- I'm about a kilometer up the road.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.320
- Well, listen, I've just
gotta go to the doc for Roosa.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.117
If you can hold on a minute,

17:39.117 --> 17:40.221
I'll give you a lift.

17:40.221 --> 17:41.331
- Really, that'd be great, actually.

17:41.331 --> 17:43.464
- Do you mind just holding onto Rover?

17:43.464 --> 17:44.338
- Rover?

17:44.338 --> 17:46.421
- Yeah, oh and my coffee.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.500
(whimsical music)

18:03.897 --> 18:05.294
- Poor fellow out front.

18:05.294 --> 18:07.136
- Oh no, not again.

18:07.136 --> 18:08.536
- I guess it happens a lot.

18:08.536 --> 18:09.843
- Hazard of the biz.

18:09.843 --> 18:11.705
I'll give him some time
and I'll send him away.

18:11.705 --> 18:12.913
- Okay.
- There you go.

18:12.913 --> 18:14.295
- Thank you.

20:09.171 --> 20:10.004
- What?

20:10.004 --> 20:12.260
- They have a wonderful
little restaurant inside.

20:12.260 --> 20:15.362
I could get you a sandwich or
perhaps some beans on toast.

20:15.362 --> 20:16.851
- Who do you think I am?

20:16.851 --> 20:19.495
- I don't know who you
are or what your story is,

20:19.495 --> 20:21.424
and I don't need to know.

20:21.424 --> 20:23.908
All you need to know is there's no shame

20:23.908 --> 20:26.429
in accepting a little help?

20:26.429 --> 20:28.443
- I'm Ray Wright.

20:28.443 --> 20:30.769
- Well it's very nice to meet you, Ray.

20:30.769 --> 20:33.769
- I'm the pro here at the golf club.

20:36.271 --> 20:37.104
- What?

20:38.650 --> 20:40.900
- I'm the goddamn golf pro.

20:41.904 --> 20:43.899
- I didn't think...

20:43.899 --> 20:45.541
I mean I...

20:45.541 --> 20:46.541
I think I...

20:47.486 --> 20:48.319
You are?

20:50.724 --> 20:52.404
I've been dying to meet you.

20:52.404 --> 20:54.192
I've heard you're a really good teacher.

20:54.192 --> 20:55.816
Maybe I could use a lesson.

20:55.816 --> 20:57.110
- Oh, you could use a lesson.

20:57.110 --> 20:58.070
I've seen you play.

20:58.070 --> 20:58.984
- You saw me play?

20:58.984 --> 21:00.874
- Yesterday on the first tee.

21:00.874 --> 21:02.013
- Oh, yesterday.

21:02.013 --> 21:05.423
Oh yeah, not exactly my finest hour.

21:05.423 --> 21:06.791
What are you doing now?

21:06.791 --> 21:07.982
Maybe I could get a lesson.

21:07.982 --> 21:09.381
- I am going to lunch.

21:09.381 --> 21:11.549
- Perfect, let me buy your lunch.

21:11.549 --> 21:15.052
- I told you, you don't
need to buy me lunch.

21:15.052 --> 21:16.123
- I don't mean buy you lunch

21:16.123 --> 21:18.377
'cause you cannot afford
to eat buy your lunch.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.300
I mean buy you lunch
'cause it would be nice

21:20.300 --> 21:21.734
to have lunch with you lunch,

21:21.734 --> 21:23.998
and you're gonna have lunch anyway.

21:23.998 --> 21:25.258
- You buying?

21:25.258 --> 21:26.341
- I'm buying.

21:28.644 --> 21:31.477
(whimsical music)

21:33.751 --> 21:35.679
- Hi, Lauren, have you met Ray?

21:35.679 --> 21:37.430
- Our new pro, of course.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.323
How are you, Ray?

21:38.323 --> 21:39.214
- Hungry.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.261
- And how are you, Lauren?

21:40.261 --> 21:43.466
- Well, you know, work never
stops for a single mom.

21:43.466 --> 21:44.707
- Oh, so you're single?

21:44.707 --> 21:46.037
And a mom?

21:46.037 --> 21:49.033
- Yes, that's the term, single mom.

21:49.033 --> 21:49.866
(laughing)
- Are you gonna

21:49.866 --> 21:50.966
put those down?

21:50.966 --> 21:52.016
- These?

21:52.016 --> 21:54.433
No, these are for table five.

21:55.394 --> 21:56.983
Just kidding.

21:56.983 --> 21:57.983
Here you go.

22:00.871 --> 22:02.460
- [Bogart] Boy, for someone who said

22:02.460 --> 22:04.793
they weren't in need of a meal.

22:04.793 --> 22:06.263
- Excuse me?

22:06.263 --> 22:07.453
- Nevermind.

22:07.453 --> 22:09.446
I'll wait until you're finished

22:09.446 --> 22:10.279
chewing.

22:11.350 --> 22:12.453
- So tell me about your golf.

22:12.453 --> 22:14.537
- Well, let's face it, I suck at golf.

22:14.537 --> 22:16.201
- Everyone sucks at golf.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.215
- No, they don't.

22:18.215 --> 22:20.384
Well, that's true, but they think they do.

22:20.384 --> 22:22.046
- Why is that?

22:22.046 --> 22:23.656
- [Ray] Well, because most do.

22:23.656 --> 22:25.513
- Well that's true, isn't it?

22:25.513 --> 22:27.431
- Hey, it's a difficult game,

22:27.431 --> 22:29.190
made even more difficult by the perception

22:29.190 --> 22:31.376
it should be easy because
the ball isn't moving.

22:31.376 --> 22:32.639
I mean, it's just sittin' there.

22:32.639 --> 22:33.782
- Very true.

22:33.782 --> 22:35.277
- [Ray] It's like life.

22:35.277 --> 22:36.294
- How so?

22:36.294 --> 22:40.089
- Well, life, it's just
sittin' there, too, isn't it?

22:40.089 --> 22:42.490
I mean, we're born into it and it's there.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.502
It's not like we had to buy a ticket.

22:44.502 --> 22:46.579
It should be easy,

22:46.579 --> 22:47.582
but it isn't.

22:47.582 --> 22:50.172
At the end of the day golf
is just a metaphor for life.

22:50.172 --> 22:52.356
- And I suck at life.

22:52.356 --> 22:54.324
Interesting, again.

22:54.324 --> 22:55.779
- Sure you don't suck at life.

22:55.779 --> 22:58.129
- I got divorced yesterday.

22:58.129 --> 22:59.893
- Oh, that sucks.

22:59.893 --> 23:01.079
- What about you?

23:01.079 --> 23:03.363
Married, divorced, kids?

23:03.363 --> 23:05.762
- I could probably help
your game right here.

23:05.762 --> 23:06.980
- [Bogart] What, over lunch?

23:06.980 --> 23:08.123
- Yep.

23:08.123 --> 23:09.402
- With your mouth full?

23:09.402 --> 23:11.450
- Most people set
themselves up for a bad game

23:11.450 --> 23:13.478
before they even reach the first tee.

23:13.478 --> 23:14.773
- [Bogart] Really?

23:14.773 --> 23:17.608
- Yes, Mr. squeal into the parking lot.

23:17.608 --> 23:19.566
- Oh, you saw that.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.190
- I still have dust in my hair.

23:21.190 --> 23:23.140
- See, that's why I thought you were-

23:23.140 --> 23:24.732
- Don't.

23:24.732 --> 23:26.080
- So tell me more.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.489
How can you help my game over lunch?

23:28.489 --> 23:30.243
- Think about the airport.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.470
- [Bogart] Think about the airport?

23:31.470 --> 23:32.814
- Think about the airport,

23:32.814 --> 23:34.284
what are you thinking about?

23:34.284 --> 23:36.248
- The airport.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.740
- What about the airport?

23:37.740 --> 23:38.990
- Stewardesses.

23:39.969 --> 23:41.280
- You have a flight.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.136
Do you arrive at the airport
one minute before takeoff?

23:44.136 --> 23:45.045
- Oh God no.

23:45.045 --> 23:46.869
90 minutes, sometimes two hours.

23:46.869 --> 23:48.568
Have you been to the airport lately?

23:48.568 --> 23:49.790
- Stay with me here.

23:49.790 --> 23:51.415
- Oh, sorry.

23:51.415 --> 23:53.080
- [Ray] And you pack?

23:53.080 --> 23:54.812
- The night before.

23:54.812 --> 23:56.039
- Golf should be the same.

23:56.039 --> 23:58.909
- But golf isn't quite as
important as catching a flight.

23:58.909 --> 24:00.080
- It isn't?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.881
Ever played a great game of golf.

24:01.881 --> 24:03.338
- Believe it or not, yeah.

24:03.338 --> 24:04.680
- Ever played a bad game of golf?

24:04.680 --> 24:06.447
- Uuuu, do I really need to answer that?

24:06.447 --> 24:09.791
- Ever had a flight as euphoric
as a great game of golf?

24:09.791 --> 24:11.738
- [Bogart] Ahhh.

24:11.738 --> 24:13.992
- Or as depressing as a bad game of golf?

24:13.992 --> 24:16.213
- Well, there were a
couple of times on United,

24:16.213 --> 24:17.914
but I totally get the point.

24:17.914 --> 24:20.523
- Golf is a major part of
Bogart Humperdink's life.

24:20.523 --> 24:22.119
- [Bogart] Humphries.

24:22.119 --> 24:24.377
- You play golf to enrich your life.

24:24.377 --> 24:26.949
You take a flight to get
from point A to point B.

24:26.949 --> 24:30.117
You can't say golf isn't
as important as a flight.

24:30.117 --> 24:31.461
- I see.

24:31.461 --> 24:32.707
So is there any more?

24:32.707 --> 24:34.280
- Nope, that's it.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.457
- [Bogart] Seriously?

24:36.457 --> 24:39.414
- It's all you get for one lunch.

24:39.414 --> 24:42.636
Join me on the first tee
tomorrow night at 6 p.m.

24:42.636 --> 24:43.861
- [Bogart] Really?

24:43.861 --> 24:45.053
- And bring your clubs.

24:45.053 --> 24:46.486
- Oh, I can do that.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.532
My wife didn't get those.

24:48.532 --> 24:51.365
(whimsical music)

24:56.406 --> 24:57.723
- Nice girl?

24:57.723 --> 24:58.647
- Oh, what?

24:58.647 --> 25:00.397
I was just lookin' at
who was on the first tee.

25:00.397 --> 25:02.115
- But the first tee's out that window.

25:02.115 --> 25:05.423
- Yes, but the practice
green is out this window,

25:05.423 --> 25:07.575
and people usually go there first.

25:07.575 --> 25:08.886
- That's almost clever.

25:08.886 --> 25:11.023
Is there one in particular
that you're sweet on?

25:11.023 --> 25:11.940
- Sweet on?

25:12.876 --> 25:13.753
- Don't be a dick.

25:13.753 --> 25:16.747
Is there one of them in
particular that you like?

25:16.747 --> 25:18.288
- Not really.

25:18.288 --> 25:20.219
- Do you remember what I
taught you about aiming?

25:20.219 --> 25:22.090
Don't just say aim for the fairway.

25:22.090 --> 25:23.401
- Aim for a tree.

25:23.401 --> 25:25.483
- Don't just aim for a tree, aim?

25:25.483 --> 25:27.303
- For a branch.

25:27.303 --> 25:28.879
- Don't just same for a branch.

25:28.879 --> 25:30.740
- Aim for a leaf.

25:30.740 --> 25:31.657
- [Ray] So?

25:34.343 --> 25:35.831
- So what?

25:35.831 --> 25:37.983
- When aiming for the love of your life?

25:37.983 --> 25:38.893
- Love of my life?

25:38.893 --> 25:40.311
I'm 15.

25:40.311 --> 25:42.411
- Don't just say him for a group of girls.

25:42.411 --> 25:43.690
- Aim for one girl.

25:43.690 --> 25:45.300
- Don't just aim for one girl.

25:45.300 --> 25:46.958
Aim for?

25:46.958 --> 25:47.890
- Her left breast?

25:47.890 --> 25:50.009
- Oh, your generation is doomed.

25:50.009 --> 25:52.683
(phone ringing)

25:52.683 --> 25:53.891
- Want me to get that?

25:53.891 --> 25:54.909
- That is what you do.

25:54.909 --> 25:57.158
(phone ringing)

25:57.158 --> 25:59.471
- Woodlands Golf Club.

25:59.471 --> 26:00.721
- It's for you.

26:03.108 --> 26:04.191
- Ray Wright.

26:05.157 --> 26:06.749
What?

26:06.749 --> 26:09.203
But you said that...

26:09.203 --> 26:11.811
Well how am I gonna do...

26:11.811 --> 26:13.978
I know what a contract is.

26:14.925 --> 26:16.842
Yeah, no, I understand.

26:17.724 --> 26:18.987
- That didn't sound good.

26:18.987 --> 26:20.109
- It wasn't good.

26:20.109 --> 26:21.611
They've moved up the deadline.

26:21.611 --> 26:22.470
- Oh.

26:22.470 --> 26:25.653
- The only way to stop it is
to actually do 50,000 rounds.

26:25.653 --> 26:26.581
- We can do that.

26:26.581 --> 26:28.048
- [Ray] In a month.

26:28.048 --> 26:28.925
- Oh.

26:28.925 --> 26:30.501
- That's over a thousand rounds a day.

26:30.501 --> 26:31.918
- 1,666 actually.

26:32.863 --> 26:33.791
- Shut up.

26:33.791 --> 26:36.765
- Point six, six, six, six, six.

26:36.765 --> 26:37.640
(door slamming)

26:37.640 --> 26:38.557
Six, seven.

26:40.530 --> 26:43.363
(whimsical music)

26:44.229 --> 26:46.896
(ball cracking)

26:55.308 --> 26:56.141
- Hi Rick.

26:57.427 --> 26:59.858
- Hey Bogart, how's it goin'?

26:59.858 --> 27:02.691
- Good, just practicing
for a lesson this evening.

27:02.691 --> 27:04.497
- Isn't that like cleaning
before the maid comes?

27:04.497 --> 27:08.347
- (chuckling) I'd like not
to make a fool of myself.

27:08.347 --> 27:09.537
Do you play golf?

27:09.537 --> 27:10.689
- Yeah, I'm on my school team.

27:10.689 --> 27:11.809
- Well, that's wonderful.

27:11.809 --> 27:13.386
You have a really good attitude.

27:13.386 --> 27:15.136
I bet you'll do well.

27:17.169 --> 27:20.336
(golf balls crashing)

27:23.609 --> 27:26.493
- Did anyone lose a Titleist three?

27:26.493 --> 27:27.660
Or a Pinnacle?

27:28.943 --> 27:29.943
Or a Wilson?

27:31.221 --> 27:32.932
Oh, hello Wilson.

27:32.932 --> 27:34.459
We might just make it.

27:34.459 --> 27:36.331
Did that thought ever cross your brain?

27:36.331 --> 27:39.411
Well, regardless, I'd
rather take my chances

27:39.411 --> 27:42.172
out there in the ocean
than to stay here and die

27:42.172 --> 27:44.049
on this shit hole of an island,

27:44.049 --> 27:49.041
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddamn golf ball.

27:49.041 --> 27:50.041
Here you go.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.991
- A feisty one.

27:54.991 --> 27:58.649
- I don't know if I'm in love
or really, really scared.

27:58.649 --> 28:00.437
- [Bogart] It could be a fine line.

28:00.437 --> 28:01.765
- Sorry about your balls.

28:01.765 --> 28:04.917
- Oh fine, that's the most
fun I've had in awhile.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.244
- That's sad.

28:06.244 --> 28:08.025
- Look, go talk to her.

28:08.025 --> 28:08.904
- What?

28:08.904 --> 28:10.867
- [Bogart] You obviously like her.

28:10.867 --> 28:12.037
Go talk to her.

28:12.037 --> 28:14.173
- She's with her friend.

28:14.173 --> 28:15.854
- [Bogart] She's leaving.

28:15.854 --> 28:17.342
- What would I even say?

28:17.342 --> 28:18.639
- See if she wants some more...

28:18.639 --> 28:20.386
Ah, no, let's think.

28:20.386 --> 28:22.489
Tell her she has a lovely swing.

28:22.489 --> 28:24.291
- She does have a nice swing.

28:24.291 --> 28:25.163
- Don't tell me,

28:25.163 --> 28:25.996
tell her.

28:30.428 --> 28:32.595
(sighing)

28:38.323 --> 28:39.881
- Nice swing.

28:39.881 --> 28:41.543
- I bet you say that to all the girls.

28:41.543 --> 28:43.923
- Yeah, 'cause there's so many
girls that play golf here.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.799
- You know, you're kind of a smart ass.

28:45.799 --> 28:47.246
- Never been accused of that before.

28:47.246 --> 28:48.492
- That's surprising.

28:48.492 --> 28:49.892
Can you check my stance, please?

28:49.892 --> 28:50.802
- Excuse me?

28:50.802 --> 28:54.635
- Stand there and see
if my stance looks good.

28:56.262 --> 28:57.331
Well?

28:57.331 --> 28:58.203
- Perfect.

28:58.203 --> 28:59.379
- No, seriously.

28:59.379 --> 29:00.237
- I am serious.

29:00.237 --> 29:01.568
Good spine angle,

29:01.568 --> 29:03.383
weight on the balls of your feet,

29:03.383 --> 29:04.400
good lines.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.450
- Good lines?

29:05.450 --> 29:07.536
- Yeah, arms hanging naturally,

29:07.536 --> 29:09.869
knees bent but not too bent.

29:12.420 --> 29:13.960
Beautiful.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.341
- That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

29:15.341 --> 29:16.358
(ball crashing)

29:16.358 --> 29:17.525
- Oops, shank.

29:18.470 --> 29:19.961
Sorry.

29:19.961 --> 29:21.202
- We should play,

29:21.202 --> 29:22.289
golf that is.

29:22.289 --> 29:23.122
- Yeah.

29:23.122 --> 29:23.955
- Yeah.

29:23.955 --> 29:24.788
- Yeah, for sure.

29:24.788 --> 29:25.621
- Yeah.

29:27.209 --> 29:29.576
- Well, I better be
getting back to work now.

29:29.576 --> 29:30.409
- Okay.

29:31.382 --> 29:32.903
(balls crashing)

29:32.903 --> 29:35.736
(whimsical music)

29:41.724 --> 29:43.436
- I thought you'd be
rolling into the parking lot

29:43.436 --> 29:45.014
right about now.

29:45.014 --> 29:46.255
- No, I listened.

29:46.255 --> 29:48.514
I even hit a quick bucket of balls.

29:48.514 --> 29:49.736
- Quick bucket?

29:49.736 --> 29:51.063
All drivers?

29:51.063 --> 29:52.942
- About half.

29:52.942 --> 29:54.324
- [Ray] Are half the shots
you're gonna hit today

29:54.324 --> 29:55.392
gonna be drivers?

29:55.392 --> 29:56.354
- Well, no.

29:56.354 --> 29:57.614
- Hit any putts?

29:57.614 --> 29:59.275
- Well, no, I didn't have time.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.693
- So you're not gonna put today?

30:00.693 --> 30:02.985
- Well, no, I mean-

30:02.985 --> 30:05.295
- I predict that 40 to 50% of the shots

30:05.295 --> 30:07.325
you're gonna hit today are gonna be putts.

30:07.325 --> 30:09.281
But you didn't think to practice putting.

30:09.281 --> 30:11.105
Unless of course you're an amazing putter.

30:11.105 --> 30:12.902
- Definitely not.

30:12.902 --> 30:14.462
- [Ray] Come on, get on with it.

30:14.462 --> 30:16.254
- Would you like the honor?

30:16.254 --> 30:18.337
- I'm not here for honor.

30:34.029 --> 30:35.779
It gets dark at nine.

30:38.052 --> 30:40.380
(club crashing)

30:40.380 --> 30:41.630
- Sorry, sorry.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.512
(ball cracking)

30:57.512 --> 30:58.756
- Nice shot.

30:58.756 --> 30:59.923
- Gee, thanks.

31:07.559 --> 31:10.289
(ball cracking)

31:10.289 --> 31:11.899
Want that one again?

31:11.899 --> 31:13.189
- Come on.

31:13.189 --> 31:16.022
(whimsical music)

31:52.798 --> 31:54.239
Got it figured out?

31:54.239 --> 31:55.657
- I think so.

31:55.657 --> 31:57.020
- Got the line.

31:57.020 --> 31:58.261
- [Bogart] Think so.

31:58.261 --> 32:00.259
- I bet you miss by six feet.

32:00.259 --> 32:02.826
- I don't know, you're the pro and all.

32:02.826 --> 32:04.407
But it's a pretty straight putt,

32:04.407 --> 32:06.559
and I got a pretty good read on it.

32:06.559 --> 32:07.392
- Okay.

32:07.392 --> 32:10.142
(birds chirping)

32:18.291 --> 32:19.124
- Oooo.

32:21.582 --> 32:22.912
- See?

32:22.912 --> 32:23.745
- See what?

32:23.745 --> 32:24.662
I nearly made it.

32:24.662 --> 32:25.876
- You missed by six feet.

32:25.876 --> 32:26.876
- I did not.

32:31.877 --> 32:33.889
What, I haven't finished yet.

32:33.889 --> 32:35.345
- Yeah, you have.

32:35.345 --> 32:38.345
(crickets chirping)

32:41.364 --> 32:43.112
Okay, stop.

32:43.112 --> 32:44.740
Now that we've got your pre-shot routine

32:44.740 --> 32:47.736
down to under five
minutes, it's time to ask,

32:47.736 --> 32:49.010
what are you aiming at?

32:49.010 --> 32:49.939
- What do you mean?

32:49.939 --> 32:51.285
- It's not a difficult question.

32:51.285 --> 32:52.580
What are you aiming at?

32:52.580 --> 32:53.597
- The fairway?

32:53.597 --> 32:55.837
- There's four acres of fairway out there.

32:55.837 --> 32:57.746
You just aiming for four acres?

32:57.746 --> 32:58.773
- Yeah.

32:58.773 --> 33:00.247
- Aim for something.

33:00.247 --> 33:02.435
In tennis they're not just
aiming for the service box,

33:02.435 --> 33:04.795
they're aiming for two
square inches of it.

33:04.795 --> 33:08.466
In basketball they're aiming
for a specific spot on the rim.

33:08.466 --> 33:10.204
In hockey they're not
just aiming for the net.

33:10.204 --> 33:12.217
They're aiming for a postage stamp

33:12.217 --> 33:14.513
above the goalie's shoulder.

33:14.513 --> 33:16.123
- I don't know hockey.

33:16.123 --> 33:17.192
- Don't be a dick.

33:17.192 --> 33:18.835
Don't just aim for the fairway.

33:18.835 --> 33:21.143
Aim for a tree off in the distance.

33:21.143 --> 33:23.944
And don't just aim for a
tree, aim for a branch.

33:23.944 --> 33:27.286
Better yet, a leaf on that branch.

33:27.286 --> 33:29.682
If you aim for the fairway and you miss,

33:29.682 --> 33:31.173
you miss the fairway.

33:31.173 --> 33:33.480
If you aim for a sprinkler
head and you miss

33:33.480 --> 33:34.986
you're still in the fairway.

33:34.986 --> 33:35.933
You follow?

33:35.933 --> 33:37.492
- That was very Robert Shaw.

33:37.492 --> 33:38.402
- Yeah?

33:38.402 --> 33:39.834
I was going for that.

33:39.834 --> 33:40.834
Now come on.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.254
- Okay, I'm aiming.

33:44.562 --> 33:46.643
- [Ray] What are you aiming for?

33:46.643 --> 33:49.023
- You see that ground under repair sign,

33:49.023 --> 33:51.389
slap dab in the middle of the fairway?

33:51.389 --> 33:53.002
- Now don't just aim for the sign.

33:53.002 --> 33:56.081
Aim for a word or even a letter in under.

33:56.081 --> 33:59.526
- Nevermind that, I'm
aiming for printed in Japan.

33:59.526 --> 34:00.443
- Atta boy.

34:02.816 --> 34:05.090
(ball cracking)

34:05.090 --> 34:06.666
Nice shot.

34:06.666 --> 34:07.499
- Yes.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.789
Come on, my son taught me this.

34:15.789 --> 34:17.871
- No, I'm not doing that.

34:18.992 --> 34:21.058
- Anyway, you're brilliant.

34:21.058 --> 34:22.599
- I didn't hit the drive.

34:22.599 --> 34:24.328
Come on, this hole's far from over.

34:24.328 --> 34:27.161
(whimsical music)

34:37.190 --> 34:38.293
Nice drive.

34:38.293 --> 34:40.869
Now, choose your club.

34:40.869 --> 34:42.442
What the hell is that?

34:42.442 --> 34:43.319
- What do you mean?

34:43.319 --> 34:44.210
It's a three-wood.

34:44.210 --> 34:45.311
- Why'd you pull your three-wood out?

34:45.311 --> 34:48.905
Do you know how hard it is to
hit a three-wood off the deck?

34:48.905 --> 34:51.266
- But it's 300 yards to the pin.

34:51.266 --> 34:53.857
- Can you hit a three-way 300 yards?

34:53.857 --> 34:54.734
- Well, no.

34:54.734 --> 34:58.167
- Can you hit anything 300 yards?

34:58.167 --> 34:59.184
- No, but.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.794
- [Ray] So are we agreed that

35:00.794 --> 35:03.053
you're not getting there in one shot?

35:03.053 --> 35:03.993
- Of course.

35:03.993 --> 35:05.736
- What's your 150 yard club.

35:05.736 --> 35:08.236
- I'd say maybe my seven iron.

35:09.264 --> 35:10.193
- I'd say maybe.

35:10.193 --> 35:12.503
Bogart, you have to know
how far your clubs go,

35:12.503 --> 35:14.234
each and every club.

35:14.234 --> 35:17.940
For now, let's assume your
seven iron goes 150 yards.

35:17.940 --> 35:19.363
- [Bogart] Okay.

35:19.363 --> 35:20.287
- Don't just stand there.

35:20.287 --> 35:21.285
Get your seven iron.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.475
- Oh, what now?

35:22.475 --> 35:23.353
- Yes now.

35:23.353 --> 35:25.017
What's your target?

35:25.017 --> 35:27.184
- Well, I'm 300 yards out.

35:28.462 --> 35:31.947
Maybe the 150 yard marker in
the middle of the fairway?

35:31.947 --> 35:34.636
- Give the man a gold star.

35:34.636 --> 35:36.287
Now come on, hit it.

35:36.287 --> 35:39.120
(whimsical music)

35:48.535 --> 35:51.202
(ball cracking)

35:55.678 --> 35:58.006
- [Announcer] Jim,
Bogart has a perfect lie

35:58.006 --> 36:00.020
in the middle of the fairway,

36:00.020 --> 36:02.018
right by the 150 yard marker.

36:02.018 --> 36:04.846
But it shouldn't interfere with his swing.

36:04.846 --> 36:05.830
- How far?

36:05.830 --> 36:08.369
- [Announcer] He's
consulting with his caddy,

36:08.369 --> 36:09.202
getting a yardage.

36:09.202 --> 36:11.952
(birds chirping)

36:17.078 --> 36:17.911
- 150.

36:18.986 --> 36:20.704
- [Announcer] 150.

36:20.704 --> 36:23.275
That should be right
in Bogart's wheelhouse.

36:23.275 --> 36:24.988
All he needs to do is put this close

36:24.988 --> 36:28.016
and the championship should be his.

36:28.016 --> 36:30.933
- Hey Walter Mitty, get on with it.

36:33.423 --> 36:34.612
- Seven iron again?

36:34.612 --> 36:36.112
- You're a genius.

36:39.394 --> 36:42.061
(ball cracking)

36:48.443 --> 36:50.861
See, you don't suck at golf.

36:50.861 --> 36:52.919
You're just not very smart.

36:52.919 --> 36:53.951
- Hey.

36:53.951 --> 36:55.701
- I was only kidding.

36:56.978 --> 36:59.238
- Hey, you haven't taken your shot.

36:59.238 --> 37:01.672
- I haven't had a shot in three holes now.

37:01.672 --> 37:03.194
- Really?

37:03.194 --> 37:05.047
- You've been too focused to notice.

37:05.047 --> 37:06.274
- Oh gosh, I'm sorry.

37:06.274 --> 37:07.151
- Don't be sorry.

37:07.151 --> 37:09.442
It's your focus that's
making you play better.

37:09.442 --> 37:10.404
- I guess you're right.

37:10.404 --> 37:11.990
- Oh, I'm right.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.351
- You know, I envy you, Ray.

37:14.351 --> 37:15.369
- Envy me?

37:15.369 --> 37:17.520
- Sure, you're working at a golf course,

37:17.520 --> 37:20.279
no stress, playing golf every day.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.298
- Are you kidding me?

37:21.298 --> 37:22.558
Playing golf every day?

37:22.558 --> 37:24.940
How many times have you
played golf this year?

37:24.940 --> 37:26.429
- It's 102,

37:26.429 --> 37:27.346
today, 103.

37:28.335 --> 37:31.013
- I've played seven times.

37:31.013 --> 37:32.013
Seven times.

37:33.443 --> 37:37.526
It should be me envying
you, except that I don't.

37:38.503 --> 37:41.494
I'm only here because we made a deal.

37:41.494 --> 37:42.773
I should be back in my office

37:42.773 --> 37:45.046
trying to figure out a way
to save the golf course.

37:45.046 --> 37:46.163
- Save it?

37:46.163 --> 37:47.195
From what?

37:47.195 --> 37:48.145
- From closing.

37:48.145 --> 37:51.312
Somebody on town council wants
to shut down the golf course.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.902
I haven't even unpacked,

37:52.902 --> 37:54.463
and they wanna close it.

37:54.463 --> 37:56.158
- Which councilor?

37:56.158 --> 37:57.549
- Cruella Deville or something like that.

37:57.549 --> 37:59.526
- (chuckling) Sue Ella Lamille.

37:59.526 --> 38:00.577
- That's her.

38:00.577 --> 38:02.817
- So what are we gonna do about it?

38:02.817 --> 38:03.690
- We?

38:03.690 --> 38:04.969
- Sure, I can help.

38:04.969 --> 38:06.457
- There's nothing you can do about it.

38:06.457 --> 38:08.240
Unless you know 25,000 people

38:08.240 --> 38:11.657
who can play golf here in the next month.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.513
(whimsical music)

38:23.212 --> 38:24.103
- Oh, there he is.

38:24.103 --> 38:25.413
Oh, Rick.

38:25.413 --> 38:26.726
- Oh, I'm on my way home.

38:26.726 --> 38:28.042
Do you need something from inside?

38:28.042 --> 38:29.006
- Just inside your brain.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.443
- We have a rules question for you.

38:30.443 --> 38:32.403
- Well, you're a pro, you should know.

38:32.403 --> 38:33.472
- I'm not actually-

38:33.472 --> 38:36.025
- Gladys and I were just
finishing a match on the ninth.

38:36.025 --> 38:37.274
- We just played nine 'cause we're old.

38:37.274 --> 38:38.323
- Speak for yourself.

38:38.323 --> 38:41.805
Anyway, I was on the green
and Gladys was just off.

38:41.805 --> 38:43.554
- I'm having trouble with my irons.

38:43.554 --> 38:45.968
I can hit my driver like
a son of a bitch, but.

38:45.968 --> 38:47.946
- But she was off the green and I was on,

38:47.946 --> 38:50.333
and she refused to play first.

38:50.333 --> 38:53.866
- Because I was closest to the pin.

38:53.866 --> 38:56.615
If I'd have gone first,
she would've seen the line.

38:56.615 --> 38:58.067
The match was tied.

38:58.067 --> 38:59.660
So this was for the whole shootin' works.

38:59.660 --> 39:00.493
- Shooting match.

39:00.493 --> 39:01.326
- I knew it was a match.

39:01.326 --> 39:03.133
I'm not in the home yet.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.042
- Okay, so Alice, you were on the green.

39:05.042 --> 39:05.875
- Correct.

39:05.875 --> 39:08.342
- And Gladys was off, but
that doesn't really matter.

39:08.342 --> 39:11.090
The question is who was
farthest from the pin.

39:11.090 --> 39:11.982
- Really?

39:11.982 --> 39:14.065
Well, that's hard to say.

39:16.252 --> 39:17.568
It is not.

39:17.568 --> 39:19.119
You darn well, I measured.

39:19.119 --> 39:21.992
Alice was exactly 20 handbags further away

39:21.992 --> 39:23.782
and I was 16.

39:23.782 --> 39:24.914
- Handbags?

39:24.914 --> 39:26.755
- Yeah, handbags.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.083
I had nothing else to measure
with so I use the handbags.

39:29.083 --> 39:30.951
- So if you used
handbags, that settles it.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.145
Alice should have played first

39:32.145 --> 39:33.456
as she was farther from the pin

39:33.456 --> 39:35.715
and being on or off the
green doesn't really matter.

39:35.715 --> 39:39.163
Which means you played out of
turn and you lose the hole.

39:39.163 --> 39:40.405
- What a crock.

39:40.405 --> 39:42.615
- You owe me a loony.

39:42.615 --> 39:44.032
- You're a loony.

39:46.453 --> 39:47.751
- Lisa?

39:47.751 --> 39:49.443
She's out on the course right now.

39:49.443 --> 39:51.202
Yeah I know what an inhaler is.

39:51.202 --> 39:52.702
What, is she okay?

39:53.980 --> 39:56.079
Of course I can, anything.

39:56.079 --> 39:57.045
Ladies change room?

39:57.045 --> 39:59.020
I can't do that.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.420
Of course I don't want her to die.

40:01.420 --> 40:02.556
Eighth hole?

40:02.556 --> 40:04.533
Okay, I'm on it.

40:04.533 --> 40:05.953
- Okay, thanks.

40:05.953 --> 40:07.036
And do hurry.

40:08.142 --> 40:09.892
He really is quite adorable.

40:09.892 --> 40:12.809
(whimsical music)

40:28.829 --> 40:31.662
(pedal squeaking)

40:33.782 --> 40:37.449
(dramatic orchestral music)

42:05.914 --> 42:08.664
(birds chirping)

42:19.315 --> 42:20.387
- Here.

42:20.387 --> 42:21.264
- What's this?

42:21.264 --> 42:22.315
Who are you?

42:22.315 --> 42:23.187
- It's me, Rick.

42:23.187 --> 42:24.376
That's your inhaler.

42:24.376 --> 42:25.287
- Take your helmet off.

42:25.287 --> 42:28.120
(gasping for air)

42:29.697 --> 42:30.766
- I know it's an inhaler.

42:30.766 --> 42:32.391
Well, why are you giving it to me?

42:32.391 --> 42:34.103
- Don't you need it?

42:34.103 --> 42:35.839
- Well sometimes, but not right now.

42:35.839 --> 42:38.067
- Five minutes ago?

42:38.067 --> 42:38.900
- No.

42:39.978 --> 42:40.895
- Then why?

42:41.957 --> 42:43.497
- Here, take this.

42:43.497 --> 42:44.846
- Thanks.

42:44.846 --> 42:47.679
(gasping for air)

42:51.655 --> 42:53.141
Then why did someone phone me

42:53.141 --> 42:54.858
telling me you were
having an asthma attack

42:54.858 --> 42:56.693
and to bring you your inhaler?

42:56.693 --> 42:58.632
- I wasn't having an attack.

42:58.632 --> 43:01.255
I have a spare inhaler in my golf bag.

43:01.255 --> 43:02.689
Where'd you get that?

43:02.689 --> 43:04.370
- You're backpack in
the lady's change room.

43:04.370 --> 43:05.245
- What?

43:05.245 --> 43:06.664
You went through my backpack.

43:06.664 --> 43:08.922
Why did you go through my backpack?

43:08.922 --> 43:10.742
And what were you doing
in the ladies change room?

43:10.742 --> 43:11.861
- They told me to.

43:11.861 --> 43:13.034
- They?

43:13.034 --> 43:14.290
- Your friend on the phone.

43:14.290 --> 43:15.989
She said you were having an asthma attack.

43:15.989 --> 43:17.355
- Oh.

43:17.355 --> 43:18.284
- Oh?

43:18.284 --> 43:20.136
- I think someone's messing with you.

43:20.136 --> 43:22.026
- That much I figured out already.

43:22.026 --> 43:24.322
- I think my friend
Sally put you up to this.

43:24.322 --> 43:25.195
- It's not funny.

43:25.195 --> 43:26.102
I thought you were dying.

43:26.102 --> 43:28.224
Not to mention a lot
of the ride was uphill.

43:28.224 --> 43:29.586
- Well, I think you're sweet.

43:29.586 --> 43:30.482
- You do?

43:30.482 --> 43:31.425
- For sure.

43:31.425 --> 43:33.992
My knight in shining
armor, come to save me.

43:33.992 --> 43:36.185
- Last week I got a call
saying that Mr. Bambrick

43:36.185 --> 43:38.532
was having a heart attack on the 11th.

43:38.532 --> 43:39.634
I brought up the defibrillator

43:39.634 --> 43:42.116
and turns out it was just heartburn.

43:42.116 --> 43:43.743
- [Lisa] Well, that killed the moment.

43:43.743 --> 43:46.685
- Sorry, I got a $10 tip out of it though.

43:46.685 --> 43:48.454
- Are you suggesting I
should give you a tip?

43:48.454 --> 43:50.064
- Oh no, I didn't mean that.

43:50.064 --> 43:51.865
- How about if I let you walk in with me?

43:51.865 --> 43:53.561
- Um, okay.

43:53.561 --> 43:55.680
- I'm sorry, that must've sounded awful.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.162
- No, I'd be happy to.

43:57.162 --> 44:00.245
- Maybe you can give me a tip or two.

45:17.307 --> 45:19.267

45:57.878 --> 45:58.711
- No?

45:58.711 --> 45:59.778

45:59.778 --> 46:01.487
- Well, you do like your
tea and your sandwiches.

46:01.487 --> 46:03.507
- I do, don't I?

46:03.507 --> 46:05.595
But if I have any more
I won't sleep tonight,

46:05.595 --> 46:07.329
and I have trouble sleeping as it is.

46:07.329 --> 46:08.935

46:08.935 --> 46:10.867

46:10.867 --> 46:12.910

46:12.910 --> 46:14.507

to tell me something.

46:14.507 --> 46:15.398
- A gift?

46:15.398 --> 46:16.271
- It was a mystery gift.

46:16.271 --> 46:17.899
Someone left it in my day locker.

46:17.899 --> 46:19.197
No idea who.

46:19.197 --> 46:21.208
- Somebody who played behind you, perhaps?

46:21.208 --> 46:22.766
- [Bogart] Ha ha, very funny.

46:22.766 --> 46:23.658
- I'll get you some change.

46:23.658 --> 46:24.777
- No, that's good.

46:24.777 --> 46:25.658
Thank you very much.

46:25.658 --> 46:26.726
- Thank you.

46:26.726 --> 46:28.265
Will I see you tomorrow?

46:28.265 --> 46:30.105
- Does bear go number two in the woods?

46:30.105 --> 46:31.152
- You're funny.

46:31.152 --> 46:32.496
- [Bogart] (chuckling) Thank you.

46:32.496 --> 46:33.686
- See you tomorrow, Bogart.

46:33.686 --> 46:35.808
- [Bogart] Thanks for everything, Lauren.

46:35.808 --> 46:37.680
- Honey, there's some
pizza in the kitchen.

46:37.680 --> 46:38.612
Would you like some?

46:38.612 --> 46:40.150
- Oh, thank you, but I can't.

46:40.150 --> 46:41.024
- It's on me.

46:41.024 --> 46:42.844
We're closing, it'll just get thrown out.

46:42.844 --> 46:44.240
- But you're closing.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.073
- That's okay.

46:45.073 --> 46:45.906
I have to cash out.

46:45.906 --> 46:46.739
You have time.

46:46.739 --> 46:47.572
- Are you sure?

46:47.572 --> 46:48.405
- Of course I'm sure.

46:48.405 --> 46:49.739
I'll be right back.

46:49.739 --> 46:52.322
(gentle music)

47:16.207 --> 47:17.658
Lisa?

47:17.658 --> 47:18.742
What are you doing here?

47:18.742 --> 47:19.918
I thought you went home.

47:19.918 --> 47:21.866
- It's hard to explain.

47:21.866 --> 47:22.916
I can't go home.

47:22.916 --> 47:24.246
- What?

47:24.246 --> 47:25.310
Why can't you go home?

47:25.310 --> 47:27.447
- Well, my mom kicked me out

47:27.447 --> 47:28.899
for her new boyfriend to move in.

47:28.899 --> 47:30.149
- That's crazy.

47:31.386 --> 47:33.239
- A little bit.

47:33.239 --> 47:35.489
- So what are you gonna do?

47:37.071 --> 47:39.560
You weren't gonna sleep here were you?

47:39.560 --> 47:40.592
You were.

47:40.592 --> 47:41.763
- I'm sorry.

47:41.763 --> 47:44.216
- Don't be sorry, you poor girl.

47:44.216 --> 47:45.093
Just this once?

47:45.093 --> 47:46.825
Or has this been going on for-

47:46.825 --> 47:47.805
- A couple days?

47:47.805 --> 47:49.873
- Well, it's not gonna happen tonight.

47:49.873 --> 47:51.672
No, no, I didn't mean it like that.

47:51.672 --> 47:53.422
I mean, you're gonna come home with me.

47:53.422 --> 47:54.302
- I can't.

47:54.302 --> 47:55.591
- Of course you can.

47:55.591 --> 47:57.346
And you are.

47:57.346 --> 47:58.675
Now come on, get your things.

47:58.675 --> 47:59.508
You know what?

47:59.508 --> 48:01.080
I'm only walking distance away.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.564
And it's a longish walk,

48:02.564 --> 48:04.600
but that'll give us
some time to talk, okay?

48:04.600 --> 48:05.473
- [Lisa] Okay.

48:05.473 --> 48:08.056
(gentle music)

48:12.092 --> 48:14.825
- Well that sounds hard.

48:14.825 --> 48:15.754
- Well, I feel like I'm

48:15.754 --> 48:17.555
making my mother sound like a monster.

48:17.555 --> 48:20.463
- Well, certainly not mother of the year.

48:20.463 --> 48:24.765
- Well, she's not that bad
until she goes off her meds.

48:24.765 --> 48:25.713
And then-
- Why did she

48:25.713 --> 48:26.652
go off her medications?

48:26.652 --> 48:28.443
- Why does anyone go off their meds?

48:28.443 --> 48:29.467
It makes them feel better.

48:29.467 --> 48:30.342
And then-

48:30.342 --> 48:31.531
- Then they think they're better

48:31.531 --> 48:33.401
and then they stop.

48:33.401 --> 48:35.783
- Yeah, and it keeps on happening.

48:35.783 --> 48:37.902
- Well where's your dad in all this?

48:37.902 --> 48:39.909
Oh, I'm sorry, do you have a dad?

48:39.909 --> 48:42.891
- Yeah, he lives in Seattle.

48:42.891 --> 48:45.233
- I don't know how to ask this delicately,

48:45.233 --> 48:47.233
but doesn't he want you?

48:48.708 --> 48:50.365
- Yeah, of course.

48:50.365 --> 48:52.787
He fought for me in court, but then lost.

48:52.787 --> 48:55.115
And then our mother, my
mother moved us here.

48:55.115 --> 48:57.369
- Does he know what's going on?

48:57.369 --> 48:59.087
- Yeah, I told him.

48:59.087 --> 49:00.029
- You told him that you're

49:00.029 --> 49:01.795
sleeping outside at a golf course?

49:01.795 --> 49:03.515
- Oh God, no.

49:03.515 --> 49:05.067
I told him I'm staying at my friends.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.484
- Well, at least that's true.

49:08.327 --> 49:10.408
You can stay with us
as long as you need to.

49:10.408 --> 49:12.688
- You and your husband?

49:12.688 --> 49:14.424
- No, me and my son.

49:14.424 --> 49:15.297
I'm a widow.

49:15.297 --> 49:16.314
- Oh God, I'm so sorry.

49:16.314 --> 49:17.625
- Oh, no, no, it's okay.

49:17.625 --> 49:19.058
It happened a long time ago.

49:19.058 --> 49:20.038
- How old's your son?

49:20.038 --> 49:21.648
- He's 15.

49:21.648 --> 49:22.871
You probably know him.

49:22.871 --> 49:24.954
He works at the pro shop.

49:26.867 --> 49:28.794
Lisa, what's wrong?

49:28.794 --> 49:31.524
- Rick, Rick from the pro shop's your son?

49:31.524 --> 49:33.162
- Yeah, he is.

49:33.162 --> 49:34.704
- I can't go to your house.

49:34.704 --> 49:36.107
- Why not?

49:36.107 --> 49:39.507
- Because it would be the
most embarrassing thing ever.

49:39.507 --> 49:40.502
- Don't be silly.

49:40.502 --> 49:42.134
Rick's a great kid.

49:42.134 --> 49:44.638
He'll totally understand.

49:44.638 --> 49:45.707
- What?

49:45.707 --> 49:46.985
She can't come in here.

49:46.985 --> 49:48.807
- Why on earth not?

49:48.807 --> 49:50.837
- Because that'll be the
most embarrassing thing ever.

49:50.837 --> 49:51.991
- Don't be ridiculous.

49:51.991 --> 49:53.497
The poor girl is in trouble,

49:53.497 --> 49:55.282
and we are gonna help her out.

49:55.282 --> 49:57.506
- A little warning would have been nice.

49:57.506 --> 49:58.855
So I could clean my room.

49:58.855 --> 50:02.194
- First, the hundred times I
asked you to clean your room

50:02.194 --> 50:03.545
should have been ample warning.

50:03.545 --> 50:06.925
And second, she ain't goin' in your room.

50:06.925 --> 50:10.616
But you could do me a favor
before I bring her in.

50:10.616 --> 50:11.493
- What?

50:11.493 --> 50:13.160
- Put some pants on.

- I did?

- That's last place.

57:06.855 --> 57:09.438

Oh darn.

and these two need a fourth.

57:16.699 --> 57:17.701
- What'd you call me?

57:19.221 --> 57:20.219
- They do.

57:20.219 --> 57:21.240
- Are you their third?

- I'm not playing, I'm working.

57:22.577 --> 57:27.515
- They're two, you're not a
third, but you need a fourth?

57:27.515 --> 57:28.499
- I don't need a fourth.

57:28.499 --> 57:30.483
I told you, I'm not playing.

57:30.483 --> 57:32.301
- Have you got a second?

Power cart three died on four.

57:34.153 --> 57:35.007
- Which hole?

57:35.007 --> 57:35.840
- Four.

57:38.127 --> 57:40.643
- Take cart one to four
and tow three back.

57:40.643 --> 57:41.476
- 10 four.

57:43.653 --> 57:45.456
- So these two are playing.

57:45.456 --> 57:46.338
- Yes.

57:46.338 --> 57:47.528
- And they need a fourth.

57:47.528 --> 57:48.649
- Correct.

57:48.649 --> 57:50.163
- Not a third?

57:50.163 --> 57:51.421
So who's their third again?

57:51.421 --> 57:53.377
- You, try to keep up.

57:53.377 --> 57:54.229
- I will.

57:54.229 --> 57:55.707
I hate slow play.

57:55.707 --> 57:58.289
Bogart, meet Jenny Ma and Victor Lowe.

57:58.289 --> 57:59.411
- Nice to meet you.

57:59.411 --> 58:01.351
Is this your first time playing Woodlands?

58:01.351 --> 58:02.913
- No, we've played here before.

58:02.913 --> 58:05.803
- But we have to warn
you, we suck at golf.

58:05.803 --> 58:07.703
- Don't we all?

58:07.703 --> 58:10.286
(upbeat music)

58:25.331 --> 58:26.248
- [Bogart] Yes.

58:26.248 --> 58:28.598
- Your putting's very good.

58:28.598 --> 58:31.107
In fact, that fourth
putt's particularly good.

58:31.107 --> 58:33.146
- Well it's half the game, isn't it?

58:33.146 --> 58:34.608
- In your case, definitely.

58:34.608 --> 58:37.191
(upbeat music)

58:50.353 --> 58:52.323
- it looks like we've got a bit of a wait.

58:52.323 --> 58:53.957
- Do you play this course often?

58:53.957 --> 58:55.347
- Every day if I can.

58:55.347 --> 58:56.335
What about you guys?

58:56.335 --> 58:57.561
- Only just recently.

58:57.561 --> 58:58.801
We fell in love with the course

58:58.801 --> 59:01.319
and that's half the reason
why we bought next door.

59:01.319 --> 59:02.185
- You bought a house?

59:02.185 --> 59:03.477
- An inn, actually.

59:03.477 --> 59:05.109
- I didn't know there was an inn nearby.

59:05.109 --> 59:06.689
- Because we haven't built it yet.

59:06.689 --> 59:08.627
- Oh, you bought the
land down by the water.

59:08.627 --> 59:09.529
- We did.

59:09.529 --> 59:11.462
- Please tell me you're
gonna put in a marina,

59:11.462 --> 59:13.828
A marina and inn
overlooking the golf course.

59:13.828 --> 59:15.767
- We're already planning golf packages.

59:15.767 --> 59:17.244
We're really excited.

59:17.244 --> 59:18.077
- Oh.

59:19.620 --> 59:21.021
- You don't think it's a good idea?

59:21.021 --> 59:23.129
- I think it's a great idea.

59:23.129 --> 59:24.357
There's only one problem.

59:24.357 --> 59:25.259
- What's that?

59:25.259 --> 59:26.871
- The golf course will probably be closed

59:26.871 --> 59:28.450
by the time you get the inn built.

59:28.450 --> 59:29.543
- Closed?

59:29.543 --> 59:30.667
- Yes, you haven't heard?

59:30.667 --> 59:32.875
Council wants to close the golf course.

59:32.875 --> 59:34.098
- Don't tell me they're gonna

59:34.098 --> 59:35.883
turn it into an outlet mall.

59:35.883 --> 59:37.903
- Worse, a park.

59:37.903 --> 59:39.507
- Why didn't we know about this?

59:39.507 --> 59:41.189
- I think everyone was
clinging to the hope

59:41.189 --> 59:42.549
it would stay open,

59:42.549 --> 59:43.938
but they need 50,000 rounds

59:43.938 --> 59:46.117
by the end of this month
for that to happen.

59:46.117 --> 59:47.241
- Where are they now?

59:47.241 --> 59:48.463
- 20,000.

59:48.463 --> 59:49.585
- That's impossible.

59:49.585 --> 59:51.421
- Maybe if we put up some posters,

59:51.421 --> 59:53.633
go crazy on social media.

59:53.633 --> 59:55.025
- Honey, it's impossible.

59:55.025 --> 59:57.881
- Victor it's gonna be pretty
hard to sell golf packages

59:57.881 --> 59:59.631
if there's no golf course.

59:59.631 --> 1:00:00.841
- Don't get mad at me.

1:00:00.841 --> 1:00:02.015
- Has your sale gone through?

1:00:02.015 --> 1:00:03.017
- It's in escrow.

1:00:03.017 --> 1:00:05.057
- You don't know me from
a hole in the ground,

1:00:05.057 --> 1:00:07.519
but real estate and
development is what I do.

1:00:07.519 --> 1:00:09.835
Would you mind if I had
to look at the contract?

1:00:09.835 --> 1:00:11.085
I have an idea.

1:00:12.759 --> 1:00:14.554
An awful idea.

1:00:14.554 --> 1:00:15.411
- Awful?

1:00:15.411 --> 1:00:17.578
- A wonderful, awful idea.

1:00:18.811 --> 1:00:21.228
(rock music)

1:01:09.816 --> 1:01:10.990
- So that's it then.

1:01:10.990 --> 1:01:13.116
We have the town hall booked for Friday.

1:01:13.116 --> 1:01:14.594
I'll bring the tea and the sandwiches.

1:01:14.594 --> 1:01:15.834
- This is all fine and dandy,

1:01:15.834 --> 1:01:19.544
but it's all for nothing if
no one from council comes.

1:01:19.544 --> 1:01:21.004
- Cruella herself.

1:01:21.004 --> 1:01:23.298
She and one other councilor
are gonna be there on Friday

1:01:23.298 --> 1:01:24.807
to hear our case.

1:01:24.807 --> 1:01:27.051
Now all we need is a crowd.

1:01:27.051 --> 1:01:28.699
Which shouldn't be too hard.

1:01:28.699 --> 1:01:29.633
Right?

1:01:29.633 --> 1:01:32.065
- Well, you do have tea and sandwiches.

1:01:32.065 --> 1:01:34.482
(rock music)

1:01:43.638 --> 1:01:47.138
- While many of us suck at
golf, we enjoy sucking at golf,

1:01:47.138 --> 1:01:49.962
and we need a golf course
to suck at golf at.

1:01:49.962 --> 1:01:51.729
It's interesting to see how many people

1:01:51.729 --> 1:01:53.956
who suck at something can
actually come together

1:01:53.956 --> 1:01:57.554
to ensure they keep on sucking at it.

1:01:57.554 --> 1:01:59.137
Wait, is that Lisa?

1:02:12.807 --> 1:02:14.028
What's going on?

1:02:14.028 --> 1:02:14.879
- Where were you?

1:02:14.879 --> 1:02:15.967
- I was putting up posters.

1:02:15.967 --> 1:02:17.749
Was that Lisa?

1:02:17.749 --> 1:02:18.923
- You just missed her.

1:02:18.923 --> 1:02:20.029
- Missed her?

1:02:20.029 --> 1:02:21.081
Where's she going?

1:02:21.081 --> 1:02:22.017
- Seattle.

1:02:22.017 --> 1:02:23.156
That was her dad.

1:02:23.156 --> 1:02:23.989
- Seattle?

1:02:25.425 --> 1:02:26.853
- I'm sorry.

1:02:26.853 --> 1:02:27.709
- Don't be sorry.

1:02:27.709 --> 1:02:29.525
It doesn't matter.

1:02:29.525 --> 1:02:30.801
(bike crashing to ground)

1:02:30.801 --> 1:02:33.384
(gentle music)

1:02:51.807 --> 1:02:54.102
- What are you doing here?

1:02:54.102 --> 1:02:56.020
- I'm on my lunch break.

1:02:56.020 --> 1:02:57.383
You told me to go.

1:02:57.383 --> 1:02:58.608
- Going to the town hall tonight?

1:02:58.608 --> 1:03:00.611
- Yeah, Bogart's making me speak.

1:03:00.611 --> 1:03:03.109
- Good, we need to hear
from you young folk, too.

1:03:03.109 --> 1:03:04.506
- Young folk?

1:03:04.506 --> 1:03:07.244
- Listen, your mom told
me about your girl.

1:03:07.244 --> 1:03:09.515
- She's not my girl.

1:03:09.515 --> 1:03:11.482
- What's her name, Leanne?

1:03:11.482 --> 1:03:13.133
- Lisa.

1:03:13.133 --> 1:03:14.613
Who's watching the shop.

1:03:14.613 --> 1:03:15.750
- Oh, it's not busy.

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:17.587
Let me give you a little bit of advice.

1:03:17.587 --> 1:03:18.674
- No, it's okay.

1:03:18.674 --> 1:03:20.375
- Remember what I told
you about a bad round?

1:03:20.375 --> 1:03:22.398
You have to get past it and move on

1:03:22.398 --> 1:03:24.355
or you'll have more bad rounds.

1:03:24.355 --> 1:03:26.191
Kinda reminds me when I was your age

1:03:26.191 --> 1:03:28.619
and there was this girl
I had a huge crush on.

1:03:28.619 --> 1:03:30.099
Her name was also Laura.

1:03:30.099 --> 1:03:31.204
- [Rick] Lisa.

1:03:31.204 --> 1:03:33.195
- No, it was Laura.

1:03:33.195 --> 1:03:35.096
Anyway, it came around to prom time,

1:03:35.096 --> 1:03:37.157
and while I never would have
had the nerve to ask her,

1:03:37.157 --> 1:03:40.503
guess who shows up at my
front door one afternoon.

1:03:40.503 --> 1:03:43.546
Laura, right there on my front porch.

1:03:43.546 --> 1:03:45.723
And she asks me to the prom.

1:03:45.723 --> 1:03:46.641
Can you believe it?

1:03:46.641 --> 1:03:48.409
Oh, I was so happy.

1:03:48.409 --> 1:03:51.519
For two days I was walking
around on cloud nine,

1:03:51.519 --> 1:03:52.436
but then...

1:03:54.047 --> 1:03:55.793
Where'd you go?

1:03:55.793 --> 1:03:59.543
(customers chattering)

1:03:59.543 --> 1:04:02.376
(whimsical music)

1:04:16.697 --> 1:04:17.564
- Hello everyone,

1:04:17.564 --> 1:04:20.402
and welcome to the town hall
to save our golf course.

1:04:20.402 --> 1:04:21.916
- Woo hoo.

1:04:21.916 --> 1:04:24.141
- I hope you've had the chance
to grab some refreshments

1:04:24.141 --> 1:04:25.790
- This tea is lovely.

1:04:25.790 --> 1:04:27.557
- It's Red Rose,

1:04:27.557 --> 1:04:29.241
only available in Canada.

1:04:29.241 --> 1:04:30.279
- Pity.

1:04:30.279 --> 1:04:32.133
- As you know, council
has made the decision

1:04:32.133 --> 1:04:35.633
to close Woodlands Golf Course
and turn it into a park.

1:04:35.633 --> 1:04:37.328
- [Crowd] Boo.

1:04:37.328 --> 1:04:39.441
- You may boo, but the golf course

1:04:39.441 --> 1:04:41.091
is a drain on our community,

1:04:41.091 --> 1:04:44.083
both financially and environmentally.

1:04:44.083 --> 1:04:47.512
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Councilor Sue Ella Lamille.

1:04:47.512 --> 1:04:49.670
Sue Ella, environmentally?

1:04:49.670 --> 1:04:51.795
- Yes, with all its chemicals.

1:04:51.795 --> 1:04:54.723
- We have our groundskeeper
here tonight, Merl.

1:04:54.723 --> 1:04:56.606
Merl, do you use chemicals?

1:04:56.606 --> 1:04:57.763
- Who me?

1:04:57.763 --> 1:04:58.767
Or the golf course?

1:04:58.767 --> 1:04:59.905
- The golf course.

1:04:59.905 --> 1:05:02.096
- No man, we're not allowed to.

1:05:02.096 --> 1:05:05.159
- Well then there's the
issue of using all our water?

1:05:05.159 --> 1:05:06.741
- Merl, how much town water

1:05:06.741 --> 1:05:08.645
does the golf course use in a year?

1:05:08.645 --> 1:05:10.055
- None, man.

1:05:10.055 --> 1:05:11.569
We have a reservoir.

1:05:11.569 --> 1:05:13.523
It's freaking ginormous.

1:05:13.523 --> 1:05:15.881
- So there's no real environmental issues.

1:05:15.881 --> 1:05:18.591
Sue Ella, you said there
was financial issues.

1:05:18.591 --> 1:05:20.373
Does the golf course lose money?

1:05:20.373 --> 1:05:22.263
- In the last five years,

1:05:22.263 --> 1:05:26.189
the course made a measly $100 one year.

1:05:26.189 --> 1:05:29.675
Broke miraculously even for three years.

1:05:29.675 --> 1:05:32.309
And last year it lost money.

1:05:32.309 --> 1:05:35.618
You the taxpayers foot that bill.

1:05:35.618 --> 1:05:39.535
- When you say it lost
money, exactly how much?

1:05:41.095 --> 1:05:44.185
- I'm sorry, I don't have that
information in front of me.

1:05:44.185 --> 1:05:46.753
- Do we not have the COO
here with us tonight?

1:05:46.753 --> 1:05:47.753
Mr. Bradley?

1:05:49.082 --> 1:05:50.749
Mr. Bradley, can you tell us

1:05:50.749 --> 1:05:53.433
how much the golf course lost last year?

1:05:53.433 --> 1:05:56.100
- Last year the golf course lost

1:05:57.619 --> 1:05:58.452
$500.

1:05:59.931 --> 1:06:00.893
- [Crowd] Boo.

1:06:00.893 --> 1:06:03.345
- You may see that as a small number.

1:06:03.345 --> 1:06:06.029
What I see is a disturbing trend

1:06:06.029 --> 1:06:08.159
that is likely to continue.

1:06:08.159 --> 1:06:12.117
This council cannot continue to subsidize

1:06:12.117 --> 1:06:16.691
a silly elitist game for
old men in plaid pants

1:06:16.691 --> 1:06:20.155
when a park can be made
available to everyone.

1:06:20.155 --> 1:06:21.705
- I object.

1:06:21.705 --> 1:06:24.290
(crowd laughing)

1:06:24.290 --> 1:06:25.240
- Elitist?

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:27.159
This game was invented by shepherds.

1:06:27.159 --> 1:06:30.223
It's played by everybody from
grandparents to grandkids.

1:06:30.223 --> 1:06:31.735
- Ray is our golf professional,

1:06:31.735 --> 1:06:34.321
and he's also the director
of our junior program,

1:06:34.321 --> 1:06:36.631
which has how many juniors, Ray?

1:06:36.631 --> 1:06:38.159
- 142.

1:06:38.159 --> 1:06:39.847
- Ah, here's one of our juniors now.

1:06:39.847 --> 1:06:40.680
Rick.

1:06:42.309 --> 1:06:43.909
So please tell us your name

1:06:43.909 --> 1:06:45.641
and what is it you do here at the club?

1:06:45.641 --> 1:06:48.533
- My name is Rick and
I work in the pro shop.

1:06:48.533 --> 1:06:52.959
- And you're also a graduate
of the junior program, correct?

1:06:52.959 --> 1:06:53.829
- Yes.

1:06:53.829 --> 1:06:56.735
- So Rick, tell us in your own words

1:06:56.735 --> 1:06:58.985
what the club means to you.

1:07:04.021 --> 1:07:05.501
(clearing throat)

1:07:05.501 --> 1:07:08.037
- My name is Rick and
because of this golf course

1:07:08.037 --> 1:07:09.873
I am gainfully employed instead of

1:07:09.873 --> 1:07:11.097
running amuck in the streets,

1:07:11.097 --> 1:07:12.947
getting hooked on crack or heroin.

1:07:12.947 --> 1:07:14.597
- That's my boy.

1:07:14.597 --> 1:07:17.366
- Well, thank you so much for
your heartfelt words, Rick.

1:07:17.366 --> 1:07:18.745
- I'd like to say something.

1:07:18.745 --> 1:07:20.563
- Ah, another one of our juniors.

1:07:20.563 --> 1:07:21.980
Come on up, Lisa.

1:07:26.613 --> 1:07:28.151
- To everyone that think

1:07:28.151 --> 1:07:31.773
that golf is an elitist, rich man's game,

1:07:31.773 --> 1:07:34.575
you don't know what golf has done for me.

1:07:34.575 --> 1:07:36.583
I come from a broken home,

1:07:36.583 --> 1:07:38.043
but because of golf I have

1:07:38.043 --> 1:07:40.627
something to look forward to every day.

1:07:40.627 --> 1:07:43.208
Because of this golf course,

1:07:43.208 --> 1:07:46.611
I've met new people, kind people,

1:07:46.611 --> 1:07:49.385
people who took me in when I had literally

1:07:49.385 --> 1:07:51.642
nowhere else to go.

1:07:51.642 --> 1:07:53.855
If you think golf is about

1:07:53.855 --> 1:07:58.855
chasing a little white ball
around, you are very mistaken.

1:07:58.866 --> 1:08:03.283
(crowd applauding)
- Thank you, Lisa.

1:08:05.531 --> 1:08:06.754
- You're back.

1:08:06.754 --> 1:08:08.844
- Forgot my inhaler.

1:08:08.844 --> 1:08:12.097
- Now please direct your
attention to the big screen.

1:08:12.097 --> 1:08:16.585
I'd like to introduce you
to Victor Lowe and Jenny Ma.

1:08:16.585 --> 1:08:20.013
Victor and Jenny own Maple Holdings,

1:08:20.013 --> 1:08:23.970
which has just purchased 20
acres next to the golf course

1:08:23.970 --> 1:08:26.970
for an inn and a much needed marina.

1:08:28.903 --> 1:08:32.117
While no rezoning was
required for this project,

1:08:32.117 --> 1:08:35.905
Jenny and Victor have
gifted to our municipality

1:08:35.905 --> 1:08:38.689
the land and construction costs

1:08:38.689 --> 1:08:42.565
for a very expansive
children's playground.

1:08:42.565 --> 1:08:44.482
- Did he say expensive?

1:08:45.639 --> 1:08:47.901
- (chuckling) Expansive.

1:08:47.901 --> 1:08:49.328
- But there's a problem.

1:08:49.328 --> 1:08:50.705
- What's the problem.

1:08:50.705 --> 1:08:52.679
- The entire sale hinges on there

1:08:52.679 --> 1:08:54.973
being a golf course next to the inn.

1:08:54.973 --> 1:08:55.852
- What?

1:08:55.852 --> 1:08:57.235
- It's in the sales contract.

1:08:57.235 --> 1:08:59.881
No golf course, no inn and marina.

1:08:59.881 --> 1:09:02.774
No inn and marina, no playground.

1:09:02.774 --> 1:09:06.238
How will the kids feel
if there's no playground?

1:09:06.238 --> 1:09:07.988
Well, let's ask them.

1:09:09.264 --> 1:09:10.598
- [Crowd] Awwww.

1:09:13.548 --> 1:09:15.423
- Hi guys, welcome.

1:09:15.423 --> 1:09:18.598
Now, Saman, do you like playgrounds?

1:09:18.598 --> 1:09:20.385
- Of course.

1:09:20.385 --> 1:09:22.594
- Now, James, do you like playgrounds?

1:09:22.594 --> 1:09:23.594
- Yes, I do.

1:09:25.841 --> 1:09:30.841
- William, what would you do
if there was no playground?

1:09:31.309 --> 1:09:32.468
- Cry.

1:09:32.468 --> 1:09:34.115
(crowd awwwing)

1:09:34.115 --> 1:09:35.937
- Of course you would.

1:09:35.937 --> 1:09:38.810
Do you really wanna make
a child cry, Cruella?

1:09:38.810 --> 1:09:40.629
- It's Sue Ella.

1:09:40.629 --> 1:09:45.166
And while this is rather
brilliant, emotional blackmail,

1:09:45.166 --> 1:09:48.193
I'm afraid it has no legal standing.

1:09:48.193 --> 1:09:49.827
- Well, we'll see about that.

1:09:49.827 --> 1:09:52.715
Our last guest tonight is Mr. Redman,

1:09:52.715 --> 1:09:55.452
from the law firm Redman and Newford.

1:09:55.452 --> 1:09:59.719
Now, Mr. Redman is an
expert in contract law.

1:09:59.719 --> 1:10:02.321
Mr. Redman, you've had a
chance to review the contract.

1:10:02.321 --> 1:10:03.817
Am I right?

1:10:03.817 --> 1:10:04.787
- I have.

1:10:04.787 --> 1:10:06.759
It's a big contract.

1:10:06.759 --> 1:10:09.103
And to the layman, it
may not seem obvious,

1:10:09.103 --> 1:10:12.402
but any lawyer will
tell you it's ironclad.

1:10:12.402 --> 1:10:13.452
That's a golf joke.

1:10:13.452 --> 1:10:15.753
(laughing)

1:10:15.753 --> 1:10:17.094
No golf course,

1:10:17.094 --> 1:10:18.428
the sale is off.

1:10:19.300 --> 1:10:20.594
- No golf course,

1:10:20.594 --> 1:10:21.428
no inn,

1:10:22.553 --> 1:10:23.855
no playground.

1:10:23.855 --> 1:10:26.615
(baby crying)
I'm sorry.

1:10:26.615 --> 1:10:28.705
Mr. Redman, you're not just a lawyer,

1:10:28.705 --> 1:10:31.318
but you're also an avid
golfer, are you not?

1:10:31.318 --> 1:10:32.165
- Guilty.

1:10:32.165 --> 1:10:32.998
- (chuckling) You don't hear that

1:10:32.998 --> 1:10:35.452
from a lawyer very often, do you?

1:10:35.452 --> 1:10:39.053
Now, Mr. Redman is a member
at Hennessy Golf Club,

1:10:39.053 --> 1:10:40.929
and that club has its own troubles,

1:10:40.929 --> 1:10:44.443
as it's in the final year
of its 99-year lease.

1:10:44.443 --> 1:10:46.959
In the past week we've been able to secure

1:10:46.959 --> 1:10:50.545
letters of commitment from
almost 50% of the membership

1:10:50.545 --> 1:10:53.727
of 800 to play at least 20 rounds

1:10:53.727 --> 1:10:56.769
at this golf course next year,

1:10:56.769 --> 1:11:00.400
with 20% wanting to
purchase season passes.

1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:03.228
On top of this, the members
of the Hennessy Golf Club

1:11:03.228 --> 1:11:06.184
have made a donation to our junior program

1:11:06.184 --> 1:11:08.268
in the amount of $10,000.

1:11:10.369 --> 1:11:13.286
(crowd applauding)

1:11:14.753 --> 1:11:16.643
- What does this even mean?

1:11:16.643 --> 1:11:20.325
40% of this, 20% of that.

1:11:20.325 --> 1:11:22.742
- I can answer that actually.

1:11:24.049 --> 1:11:28.299
We, given membership and
20 rounds, and yield fees.

1:11:33.059 --> 1:11:35.629
Yup, conservatively about 360.

1:11:35.629 --> 1:11:36.546
- 360 what?

1:11:38.177 --> 1:11:39.789
Rounds?

1:11:39.789 --> 1:11:40.636
Dollars?

1:11:40.636 --> 1:11:41.469
Pesos?

1:11:42.338 --> 1:11:44.600
- According to my quick calculations

1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:48.068
it's additional revenue of $360,000.

1:11:48.068 --> 1:11:49.735
- $360,000 everyone.

1:11:50.838 --> 1:11:53.588
(crowd cheering)

1:11:58.150 --> 1:11:59.523
(book slamming)

1:11:59.523 --> 1:12:01.445
- Well, they could of led with that.

1:12:01.445 --> 1:12:02.856
Saved us a lotta time.

1:12:02.856 --> 1:12:07.856
(crowd cheering)
(rock music)

1:12:14.318 --> 1:12:16.304
- The waiting is killing me.

1:12:16.304 --> 1:12:18.498
- Well, it doesn't seem to
have hurt your appetite much.

1:12:18.498 --> 1:12:19.498
- Excuse me?

1:12:21.177 --> 1:12:22.483
Hello?

1:12:22.483 --> 1:12:23.965
Oh, well that's good news.

1:12:23.965 --> 1:12:25.804
Okay, thanks for letting me know.

1:12:25.804 --> 1:12:26.973
All right, bye.

1:12:26.973 --> 1:12:27.825
- Well?

1:12:27.825 --> 1:12:28.674
- It passed.

1:12:28.674 --> 1:12:30.088
A unanimous resolution to

1:12:30.088 --> 1:12:32.209
revisit the golf course in five years.

1:12:32.209 --> 1:12:34.721
And in the meantime,
it's business as usual.

1:12:34.721 --> 1:12:36.102
- That's fantastic.

1:12:36.102 --> 1:12:37.679
And you know what five years means?

1:12:37.679 --> 1:12:38.531
- [Ray] What?

1:12:38.531 --> 1:12:40.059
- Brand new council.

1:12:40.059 --> 1:12:42.202
Means this council doesn't
have to deal with it

1:12:42.202 --> 1:12:43.781
until after the next election.

1:12:43.781 --> 1:12:45.311
- Well, you know about this stuff.

1:12:45.311 --> 1:12:47.050
All I know is I get to unpack my boxes.

1:12:47.050 --> 1:12:49.059
- [Rick] Ray, phone.

1:12:49.059 --> 1:12:50.962
- No, no, no, I got this.

1:12:50.962 --> 1:12:53.295
- I was just gettin' my gum.

1:12:55.021 --> 1:12:56.181
Good news, Lauren.

1:12:56.181 --> 1:12:58.050
The council has voted
to keep the golf course

1:12:58.050 --> 1:12:59.853
for another five years.

1:12:59.853 --> 1:13:01.638
- Oh, that's wonderful.

1:13:01.638 --> 1:13:03.493
I'm so proud of you, Bogart.

1:13:03.493 --> 1:13:04.493
I really am.

1:13:05.719 --> 1:13:06.893
- Thank you.

1:13:06.893 --> 1:13:09.393
(jazzy music)

1:13:10.665 --> 1:13:12.333
Is that for me?

1:13:12.333 --> 1:13:13.267
- One cup of tea.

1:13:13.267 --> 1:13:14.763
- I was gonna order one.

1:13:14.763 --> 1:13:15.615
How'd you know?

1:13:15.615 --> 1:13:17.483
- Sometimes I know what you're gonna say,

1:13:17.483 --> 1:13:18.900
most of the time.

1:13:20.592 --> 1:13:23.177
- Hey, what'd you do that for?

1:13:23.177 --> 1:13:25.094
- I've been wondering whether I'd like it.

1:13:25.094 --> 1:13:27.334
- And, what's the verdict?

1:13:27.334 --> 1:13:28.916
- I don't know yet.

1:13:37.450 --> 1:13:39.153
I'll be in the kitchen.

1:13:39.153 --> 1:13:42.193
If you need anything just whistle.

1:13:42.193 --> 1:13:44.067
You know how to whistle don't you?

1:13:44.067 --> 1:13:47.484
You just put your lips together and blow.

1:13:49.639 --> 1:13:51.282
Bogart?

1:13:51.282 --> 1:13:52.341
Bogart.

1:13:52.341 --> 1:13:53.800
Bogart.

1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:55.279
Are you okay?

1:13:55.279 --> 1:13:56.779
- Yes, I know how.

1:13:57.695 --> 1:13:59.087
- Your tea.

1:13:59.087 --> 1:14:00.433
- Oh, thank you.

1:14:00.433 --> 1:14:01.809
- Are you sure, you're okay?

1:14:01.809 --> 1:14:02.965
- Absolutely.

1:14:02.965 --> 1:14:04.853
- Okay, well, if you need anything,

1:14:04.853 --> 1:14:06.520
you know where I am.

1:14:07.978 --> 1:14:09.409
- Golf is a funny game.

1:14:09.409 --> 1:14:11.481
Whether people play it or not, love it or,

1:14:11.481 --> 1:14:13.217
they usually have an opinion about it.

1:14:13.217 --> 1:14:15.833
And those who don't know it,
can't possibly understand

1:14:15.833 --> 1:14:18.110
that it's more than a game.

1:14:18.110 --> 1:14:20.883
At the end of the day, just like in life,

1:14:20.883 --> 1:14:23.311
it doesn't really matter
if you suck at it.

1:14:23.311 --> 1:14:27.228
What matters is you tee
it up and give it a go.

1:16:41.990 --> 1:16:45.100
You want a tee time between nine and 9:30?

1:16:45.100 --> 1:16:47.100
Sorry, we're all booked.

1:16:48.876 --> 1:16:51.366
- I suck at golf golf.

1:16:51.366 --> 1:16:53.206
- I suck at golf.

1:16:53.206 --> 1:16:55.324
- I suck at golf.

1:16:55.324 --> 1:16:57.555

1:16:57.555 --> 1:16:59.085
