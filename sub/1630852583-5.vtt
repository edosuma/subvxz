01:46.244 --> 01:55.123
# I will control the night
If I have a tail

01:55.223 --> 01:58.127
# I will control... #

01:58.227 --> 01:59.558
- Step one.
- Mm-hm.

01:59.658 --> 02:01.428
Cups.

02:01.528 --> 02:04.201
Do you want me to
give you a hand? Are you sure?

02:04.301 --> 02:06.303
No, no.
I just need a teaspoon.

02:06.403 --> 02:07.800
Aha!

02:07.900 --> 02:10.176
Yep. OK.

02:10.276 --> 02:11.475
Ta da, teaspoon.

02:11.575 --> 02:13.577
Uh... A little honey.

02:13.677 --> 02:15.381
Honey. OK. Great.

02:15.481 --> 02:17.747
And...

02:17.847 --> 02:19.387
- Do you like honey?
- I do.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.225
- OK, tell me when.

02:22.325 --> 02:24.096
Tell me when it's good for you.

02:24.196 --> 02:26.726
- Stop!
- OK.

02:26.826 --> 02:29.763
Did you drink tea
before coming to Australia?

02:29.863 --> 02:31.635
Mmm. Mmm.

02:33.704 --> 02:37.080
Lisa used to complain that
nobody had kettles, back home.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.743
She almost slapped me

02:38.843 --> 02:41.483
because I tried to boil water
in the microwave.

02:43.486 --> 02:45.091
Is this small talk?

02:45.191 --> 02:47.457
Is this what we're
supposed to do now?

02:47.557 --> 02:49.857
Mmm. I guess so?

02:49.957 --> 02:51.497
I guess.

02:57.736 --> 02:59.474
Are we being stupid?

03:02.412 --> 03:05.482
May I? Can I borrow
that for one sec?

03:07.485 --> 03:11.258
I'm just gonna get
the right angle

03:11.358 --> 03:13.724
Hmm...

03:13.824 --> 03:17.233
That's good. Can you sit up
for me a bit, please?

03:17.333 --> 03:18.500
Thank you.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.342
I mean,
how are we gonna tell Emma?

03:24.442 --> 03:25.839
I don't think Emma
will have an issue

03:25.939 --> 03:28.182
with the two of us
being together.

03:28.282 --> 03:30.548
I feel like there's
a big problem waiting for us

03:30.648 --> 03:31.880
around the corner.

03:31.980 --> 03:33.850
A problem with hair.

03:33.950 --> 03:35.721
Can you move your head
a little to the left for me?

03:37.393 --> 03:38.559
Too much. Uh!

03:38.659 --> 03:40.728
Perfect. Just like that.

03:42.367 --> 03:44.369
I don't want her to get hurt.

03:44.469 --> 03:46.173
We won't let that happen.

03:46.273 --> 03:47.737
How do you know that?

03:47.837 --> 03:49.706
Sorry.

03:49.806 --> 03:51.841
Gary.
I've never done this before.

03:51.941 --> 03:53.513
I...

03:53.613 --> 03:56.187
I don't really know what to do.

03:56.287 --> 03:58.784
Can I make a suggestion?

03:58.884 --> 04:04.264
What's the harm in letting this
take the lead for a bit?

04:04.364 --> 04:07.697
- 'Cause I might eat it.
- Mmm.

04:07.797 --> 04:11.571
Why don't we just
enjoy each other's company.

04:11.671 --> 04:15.445
If it doesn't work out,
at least we gave it a shot.

04:16.545 --> 04:18.712
After all...

04:18.812 --> 04:20.418
..a wolf needs a pack.

04:23.786 --> 04:26.326
I didn't know
you could do this.

04:26.426 --> 04:27.989
Don't give me
too much credit yet.

04:28.089 --> 04:30.795
Hang on.
I just need one more second...

04:30.895 --> 04:33.336
OK.

04:33.436 --> 04:35.339
OK, usually I have more time
and more light.

04:35.439 --> 04:37.606
But I hope you like it.

04:37.706 --> 04:39.245
What do you think?

04:42.845 --> 04:45.385
- You like it?
- Where are my arms?

04:45.485 --> 04:46.849
Hidden behind

04:46.949 --> 04:48.918
these two giant tits.

04:53.023 --> 04:55.531
Dad still says
dumb things sometimes.

04:55.631 --> 04:58.403
But not as much. It's like
she's distracting him.

04:58.503 --> 05:00.802
And you don't like that.

05:00.902 --> 05:03.509
No, it's fun
hanging out together.

05:03.609 --> 05:06.612
- How did they meet?
- She crashed into our car.

05:06.712 --> 05:09.748
- You were in another crash?
- No.

05:09.848 --> 05:12.016
She was the one
that hit you both.

05:13.589 --> 05:15.690
But last week,
Dad backed into her car,

05:15.790 --> 05:17.924
and we drove into
an Italian restaurant.

05:18.024 --> 05:20.334
YOUR dad drove
into Nonna Loretta's?

05:21.666 --> 05:23.436
Yep.

05:23.536 --> 05:25.638
My wife and I tried to
eat there the other night.

05:27.443 --> 05:30.546
Why didn't you tell me
about the other car accident?

05:32.010 --> 05:35.354
Do you feel threatened by Mary?

05:36.950 --> 05:38.556
It's perfectly natural
to feel as though

05:38.656 --> 05:40.823
Mary is intruding
on your space.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.594
I myself have a step-child.

05:42.694 --> 05:44.663
And I had to respect
Tony's boundaries

05:44.763 --> 05:46.335
when I was courting his mother.

05:46.435 --> 05:48.371
It's never an easy dynamic.

05:48.471 --> 05:50.671
But I think, if Mary respects

05:50.771 --> 05:54.105
the pre-existing boundaries
you've set up with your father,

05:54.205 --> 05:55.579
then there...

05:55.679 --> 05:57.581
..there shouldn't be a problem.

05:57.681 --> 06:00.916
Look at Tony and I.
He and I work together.

06:01.016 --> 06:04.052
And I mean that metaphorically
as well as literally.

06:04.152 --> 06:06.056
He has a job here.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.735
It's not working.

06:14.704 --> 06:16.035
What do you mean by that?

06:16.135 --> 06:18.104
I mean this.

06:18.204 --> 06:20.712
Well, you need someone
to help you, Emma,

06:20.812 --> 06:23.385
- and, with your problems...
- I know.

06:23.485 --> 06:25.014
It's just I don't feel that

06:25.114 --> 06:27.083
you're the right person
to do that.

06:27.183 --> 06:30.857
I don't feel safe enough
to be vulnerable with you.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.565
Can you recommend someone else?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.601
Um...

06:36.701 --> 06:38.737
Yes. Yes.

06:41.103 --> 06:43.710
Tony, can you
bring the Filofax in, please?

06:43.810 --> 06:45.779
Don't have the Filofax!

06:56.123 --> 07:00.468
# Janey came back
from the stand

07:00.568 --> 07:04.507
# Smiling

07:04.607 --> 07:08.842
# With the writing
of Kafka in hand

07:08.942 --> 07:13.750
# And a bunny in a can

07:13.850 --> 07:15.554
# Slipping and sliding

07:15.654 --> 07:18.020
# You feel yourself asking her

07:18.120 --> 07:22.630
# Why would you want me to try?

07:22.730 --> 07:27.164
# Squeezing your wrist
and she's pulling you closer

07:27.264 --> 07:31.642
# Down where the devils
are dying with laughter

07:31.742 --> 07:35.846
# Then led to a place where
there's no form of pleasure

07:35.946 --> 07:39.917
# She blows you a kiss
from her lips

07:40.017 --> 07:44.055
# She's your baby

07:44.155 --> 07:48.599
# She's your baby

07:48.699 --> 07:53.068
# She's your baby

07:58.075 --> 08:01.980
# Those below us
cannot be renounced

08:02.080 --> 08:07.020
# 'Cause they're talking

08:07.120 --> 08:10.992
# And for once I wish
they'd shut up their mouths

08:11.092 --> 08:16.065
# Lock their doors
and stay in the house

08:16.165 --> 08:18.068
# And while you're inside there

08:18.168 --> 08:21.676
# You might want
to question the fact

08:21.776 --> 08:24.978
# That you're not
quite the same

08:25.078 --> 08:29.753
# And look to the room where
she's keeping so quiet

08:29.853 --> 08:33.825
# A million layers
of crust and deposit

08:33.925 --> 08:38.567
# Blanket the seasons
and bury the reasons

08:38.667 --> 08:42.232
# You told her
that this was for good

08:42.332 --> 08:46.776
# She's your baby

08:46.876 --> 08:51.211
# She's your baby

08:51.311 --> 08:55.151
# She's your baby

10:06.918 --> 10:09.922
I don't think we can keep
this from her any longer.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.293
We tell her
before the next full moon.

10:16.393 --> 10:18.462
And we bring her back here.

10:21.036 --> 10:24.403
And if it goes badly
and she freaks out,

10:24.503 --> 10:26.713
what does that mean
for all of us?

10:26.813 --> 10:29.783
- We can't think that way.
- We have to.

10:29.883 --> 10:32.721
Things have been...
been so good.

10:32.821 --> 10:35.758
I don't want this to be
the thing that undoes us.

10:35.858 --> 10:39.763
If we keep a secret
this big from her,

10:39.863 --> 10:41.294
she will never forgive us.

10:43.264 --> 10:46.432
The longer it takes,
the harder it's gonna get.

10:46.532 --> 10:48.403
We'll be here with her.

10:50.174 --> 10:51.539
She loves you.

10:53.608 --> 10:55.313
We both do.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.031
Head forward.

11:20.281 --> 11:22.547
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah. I was, um...

11:22.647 --> 11:24.352
I was worried about the cake.

11:24.452 --> 11:26.321
- I can take it.
- Oh, thanks.

11:26.421 --> 11:28.258
I can't wait
to meet your Aunt Sarah.

11:28.358 --> 11:30.162
She's really nice.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.202
Hello, everybody!

11:36.302 --> 11:38.810
Hi! Mary! My god!

11:38.910 --> 11:42.310
It's so good
to finally meet you.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.015
Aw.

11:44.115 --> 11:46.579
Well, we've named her.

11:46.679 --> 11:48.186
Lisa.

11:51.124 --> 11:52.961
You OK with that, Dad?

11:53.061 --> 11:54.931
Yes. Yeah, of course I am.

11:55.031 --> 11:57.132
That's amazing.

11:57.232 --> 11:59.904
- It really suits her.
- It does.

12:02.635 --> 12:04.911
Taco! What the fuck
is wrong with you?

12:05.011 --> 12:06.309
Swear jar!

12:06.409 --> 12:08.312
Well, that
was a little unusual.

12:08.412 --> 12:10.083
- Hi, Mary. This is Olivia.
- Hi.

12:10.183 --> 12:12.020
Come on, let's go.
Let's go in.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.353
Olivia, fist bump.

12:14.453 --> 12:15.893
Boom!

12:15.993 --> 12:17.423
Did Dad tell
you about the trip?

12:17.523 --> 12:20.493
- Trip?
- Yeah. We're going camping.

12:20.593 --> 12:22.165
Next week,
for the school holidays.

12:22.265 --> 12:24.300
- Mm-hm.
- Well, this is new.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.875
Especially for someone
as outdoorsy as you.

12:26.975 --> 12:28.471
It was her idea.

12:28.571 --> 12:31.508
I know that.
Where are you going?

12:31.608 --> 12:33.983
Oh, we're just going to go
somewhere we can see the stars.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.579
I could lend you
our gear if you want.

12:35.679 --> 12:38.022
- We haven't used it in ages.
- Oh, don't worry,

12:38.122 --> 12:39.651
I've got
a ton of camping stuff.

12:39.751 --> 12:42.556
- Mary's got everything.
- What am I looking at here?

12:42.656 --> 12:45.527
The vegan ones - well you can tell which
ones they are that's pretty obvious.

12:45.627 --> 12:48.068
The other ones are artisan
sausages from our mate.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.236
He's a chemist.
He makes them on the side.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.976
Hope you don't mind - I'm gonna
give the vegan ones a miss.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.012
I'm craving meat at the moment.

12:55.112 --> 12:57.213
You know what, me too.

12:57.313 --> 12:58.918
Emma told us you were vegan.

12:59.018 --> 13:00.415
Oh, I am, I am.

13:00.515 --> 13:02.484
But you better listen
to your body.

13:02.584 --> 13:04.619
- Baby, can you take her?

13:04.719 --> 13:07.590
No, no, no. You guys eat.
Let me hold her.

13:07.690 --> 13:09.658
- Come on.
- OK.

13:09.758 --> 13:13.399
- Going to Uncle Gary...
- Oh, this is delicious.

13:13.499 --> 13:16.337
- Thank you.
- Shh, shh.

13:16.437 --> 13:18.274
Ooh, she likes you.

13:18.374 --> 13:21.080
Yeah, that's only
'cause she's full of milk.

13:21.180 --> 13:23.446
You were always
so good with babies.

13:23.546 --> 13:25.250
I like the vegan ones.

13:25.350 --> 13:27.550
Mummy, I need to go toilet.

13:27.650 --> 13:29.553
Oh, God. Timing.

13:29.653 --> 13:31.060
Ray, can you take her?

13:31.160 --> 13:32.656
I gotta keep an eye
on the steaks.

13:32.756 --> 13:35.066
- I can take her.
- No, Em, it's OK.

13:35.166 --> 13:36.596
No, you really don't
want to get involved in this.

13:36.696 --> 13:38.169
It's fine.

13:38.269 --> 13:39.501
Hey, babe,
you want to have a hold?

13:39.601 --> 13:40.634
Oh, no thanks.

13:40.734 --> 13:42.339
Go on. She's all sleepy.

13:42.439 --> 13:44.277
No, I don't want to
hold the fucking baby.

14:07.341 --> 14:08.672
What's going on?

14:08.772 --> 14:10.476
If all this is too much
for you, I'm happy...

14:10.576 --> 14:12.149
I'm late.

14:12.249 --> 14:14.713
I didn't want to tell you that.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.122
- What?
- Yeah.

14:17.222 --> 14:18.751
I didn't want to ruin today.

14:18.851 --> 14:21.623
Why would it ruin it?
How late?

14:21.723 --> 14:24.033
Like, late.

14:24.133 --> 14:26.134
Like, late-late.

14:26.234 --> 14:28.401
- Let's just not talk about it now.
- You brought it up.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.371
But that's because
you kept on asking me.

14:30.471 --> 14:32.341
Right. OK.

14:32.441 --> 14:34.509
Wow, this is a
lot to process.

14:34.609 --> 14:36.478
Yeah. Not now.

14:36.578 --> 14:38.712
'Not now' as in, like, not now
at this point in your life?

14:38.812 --> 14:42.321
Not now as in not right now, right here,
at a fucking barbeque!

14:42.421 --> 14:45.193
- Why are you so stressed?
- Because you just don't think anything through!

14:45.293 --> 14:47.196
Is it because we haven't
told Em about the other thing?

14:47.296 --> 14:50.431
- They're the same thing.
- What are you talking about?

14:50.531 --> 14:54.139
What if I bring another
werewolf into this world?

14:54.239 --> 14:56.770
Are you serious?
Do I look like I'm joking?

14:56.870 --> 15:00.114
We'd love it. Whatever it is,
we would obviously love it.

15:00.214 --> 15:01.710
That's so easy for you to say.

15:01.810 --> 15:04.318
But it's true.
I mean, there would obviously

15:04.418 --> 15:06.717
be a lot to take into consideration,
a lot to think about.

15:06.817 --> 15:10.458
You're not the one
that could eat our baby.

15:10.558 --> 15:12.428
You would never eat our baby.

15:12.528 --> 15:15.200
You wouldn't eat our baby!
Why would you eat our baby?

15:15.300 --> 15:16.830
I wouldn't eat it as me,

15:16.930 --> 15:20.538
but what about when I'm...
something else?

15:20.638 --> 15:23.773
You know how bad
I would feel if I...

15:23.873 --> 15:25.743
ate our child.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.548
I'm late, and I'm already
eating artisan sausages

15:28.648 --> 15:30.320
made by a fucking pharmacist.

15:30.420 --> 15:32.157
Just because
you eat meat at a barbeque

15:32.257 --> 15:34.391
doesn't mean you're gonna
eat a fucking child.

15:34.491 --> 15:36.724
Think about how much
you'd resent me if I did.

15:36.824 --> 15:38.331
You've always wanted a family.

15:38.431 --> 15:40.301
It's something
I've always wanted too.

15:41.534 --> 15:43.337
You've already had it.

15:43.437 --> 15:45.671
No. I haven't.

15:48.609 --> 15:51.546
The second Lisa was diagnosed,

15:51.646 --> 15:54.517
it was taken from me.

15:54.617 --> 15:57.753
Don't you think the minute Emma
finds out about me

15:57.853 --> 15:59.888
this family's gonna
be over anyway.

15:59.988 --> 16:02.859
I mean, it's gonna be the thing that just tips us
over the edge.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.762
I thought you were the one
who believed that

16:04.862 --> 16:08.206
the universe throws things
at you for a reason.

16:08.306 --> 16:10.803
I wasn't even gonna tell you.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.343
What are you talking about?
What does...

16:12.443 --> 16:14.412
What does that even mean?

16:14.512 --> 16:16.349
Wait a sec.

16:16.449 --> 16:19.287
Please, babe, this can't...

16:19.387 --> 16:21.223
This cannot be over. This
conversation cannot be over.

16:21.323 --> 16:22.786
- We need to think it through...
- No.

16:22.886 --> 16:24.690
- I can't talk about this now.
- ..all of the possibilities here...

16:24.790 --> 16:26.428
- Not now!
- It's not a foregone conclusion...

16:26.528 --> 16:27.595
Gary, not now. Fuck!

16:27.695 --> 16:29.433
Swear jar!

16:37.874 --> 16:39.843
That was a really bad word.

16:41.780 --> 16:45.256
Mummy, $50!

16:45.356 --> 16:47.358
Jesus! Did Uncle Gary
drop a C-bomb?

16:55.402 --> 16:57.735
-Oh, wow. That is so impressive!
-Look at that!

16:57.835 --> 17:00.639
It's all for you.
I don't have a sweet tooth.

17:00.739 --> 17:04.579
Do I? I usually just make them
for the nursing home.

17:04.679 --> 17:06.350
That's amazing. Cherries are in season.

17:06.450 --> 17:08.683
Dad?

17:08.783 --> 17:10.389
Dad?

17:10.489 --> 17:12.557
He's not gonna
jump in again, is he?

17:14.824 --> 17:17.895
Sorry.
I was... miles away.

17:23.024 --> 17:24.060
Let's dish it out.

17:24.070 --> 17:25.805
- Yum, yes please.
- Here, sweetie.

17:25.905 --> 17:28.743
- Thanks Mary.

17:28.843 --> 17:31.515
Yeah, you're nursing,
you can have twice the amount.

17:31.615 --> 17:32.684
Oh, thank you.

17:46.802 --> 17:48.869
I know I don't need to
tell you this.

17:48.969 --> 17:50.872
The difference
is like night and day.

17:50.972 --> 17:54.349
Yeah. Yeah.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.077
Did she talk to you
about anything recently?

17:56.177 --> 18:00.390
No. But it's a good thing,
from what I can see.

18:00.490 --> 18:05.023
Seeing her get this excited about
something as simple as going camping...

18:05.123 --> 18:07.499
It's beautiful.

18:07.599 --> 18:10.536
We've been planning to tell
her something on the trip.

18:10.636 --> 18:12.803
What do you mean?
Are you getting married?

18:12.903 --> 18:15.344
No. No, no, no.

18:15.444 --> 18:18.745
Nothing like that.
Not that I wouldn't.

18:18.845 --> 18:20.077
Then what?

18:26.855 --> 18:30.057
Um... It's nothing.

18:30.157 --> 18:33.567
Gary, don't pull one of those
faces and overthink things.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.405
I know that's hard for you.

18:36.505 --> 18:38.739
Don't fuck this up.

18:38.839 --> 18:40.577
Swear jar.

18:43.141 --> 18:45.649
Come on, guys.
We gotta get going.

18:45.749 --> 18:49.049
-Bye!
-See you, guys.

18:49.149 --> 18:50.623
See you next time, you four.

18:50.723 --> 18:52.891
See you next time, you three!

18:54.057 --> 18:55.695
Bye!

18:55.795 --> 18:59.163
See you! Bye!

19:42.089 --> 19:44.762
Listen, um...

19:44.862 --> 19:49.130
I would never ask you to
do anything you don't want.

19:49.230 --> 19:52.641
I would always
protect our baby.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.911
But I wouldn't want to
jeopardise what we have.

19:58.682 --> 20:01.048
Or the family
we've already become.

20:04.591 --> 20:08.124
I can never understand
what your body goes through.

20:10.094 --> 20:11.799
And I never will.

20:13.362 --> 20:15.199
But I do need you to know

20:15.299 --> 20:19.975
that I will always be there
to support you.

20:22.341 --> 20:24.244
The three of us can be a...

20:24.344 --> 20:25.652
..pack.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.593
We make a pretty good pack.

22:17.298 --> 22:18.739
Are you OK?

22:25.947 --> 22:28.214
Watch out for that step
on the way back.

22:35.256 --> 22:38.292
Look at her.
She loves it here.

22:38.392 --> 22:41.297
Do you really think
that we should tell her?

22:43.036 --> 22:45.170
I mean, she's so happy.

23:06.903 --> 23:13.307
# Ring the bells
that still can ring

23:15.574 --> 23:20.250
# Forget
your perfect offering... #

23:20.350 --> 23:21.955
There's supposed to be
a full moon tomorrow.

23:22.055 --> 23:23.826
Can we stay an extra night?

23:26.325 --> 23:29.262
- No, sweetie.
- Why not?

23:29.362 --> 23:31.099
Well, um...

23:31.199 --> 23:34.104
Well, we've gotta get back
for something.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.979
Hey, bubs... Uh...

23:43.414 --> 23:47.484
Mary and I have something
important to tell you.

23:47.584 --> 23:49.190
Are you breaking up?

23:49.290 --> 23:50.830
No.

23:53.328 --> 23:56.001
You've both been really weird.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.300
It's not that.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.270
Then what is it?

24:00.635 --> 24:02.340
Mary...

24:08.613 --> 24:10.252
Um...

24:12.420 --> 24:15.588
Mary is... is...

24:15.688 --> 24:17.228
Pregnant.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.470
We're gonna have a baby.

24:28.947 --> 24:33.382
# Forget
your perfect offering

24:36.023 --> 24:44.099
# There is a crack,
a crack in everything

24:44.199 --> 24:47.137
# That's how
the light gets in... #
