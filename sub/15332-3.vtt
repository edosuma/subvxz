need to tell me the truth.

40:21.667 --> 40:25.236
Well, mama hasn't been
very truthful about something.

40:28.907 --> 40:33.611
Your daddy has not been
working in Dallas.

40:33.645 --> 40:34.946
Where is he?

40:37.383 --> 40:38.950
I don't know.

40:41.220 --> 40:42.553
He's lost?

40:42.588 --> 40:46.958
Uh, confused, really.

40:48.360 --> 40:52.563
I sure hope
he's figuring it all out.

40:52.597 --> 40:54.398
Is he gonna come back?

40:54.432 --> 40:57.501
No, not right now.
