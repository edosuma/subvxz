00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.370
- This whole living situation
with Severide,

00:03.737 --> 00:05.239
it's not a permanent thing.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.707
I'm gonna start
that apartment search again.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.042
- No rush.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.112
- Severide, we are running
out of time

00:11.145 --> 00:12.680
for you to shut down
those leaks.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.082
- Yeah, copy that, Chief.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.549
- Whoa!

00:17.751 --> 00:19.620
- I'm headed for the roof.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.390
- He went to get Severide.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.424
*

00:23.457 --> 00:25.626
- Get ready!
- This is insane.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.395
- One, two,

00:27.428 --> 00:28.729
three!

00:42.743 --> 00:44.212
- Let's go round back!

00:44.245 --> 00:45.679
- Let's go!
- To the river!

01:07.301 --> 01:09.503
Where are they?

01:10.338 --> 01:12.640
- Casey!

01:12.673 --> 01:15.109
- Severide!

01:15.143 --> 01:17.178
- There!

01:26.220 --> 01:28.256
- Severide!

01:28.289 --> 01:29.890
- I got Severide!

01:29.923 --> 01:32.360
Kelly!

01:32.393 --> 01:34.562
I'm gonna harness up
and get him, Chief.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.438
- Otis, extend the aerial.
- Yeah, copy.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.610
- Severide!

01:49.643 --> 01:51.212
- Casey, come to shore.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.614
Kidd will get him
with the aerial.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.617
Squad, get him out.
Get him out now.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.353
- Watch your back.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.262
- Okay, swing right.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.501
Swing stop.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.470
- Show me what you do.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.172
Take her up.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.945
- Stella, you got this.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.914
Good.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.650
- Swing right.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.695
- Hey!

02:41.729 --> 02:43.397
You need to back up.
Let us do our work.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.366
Get out of here!
- Okay. All right, yeah.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.301
You got it.
Go get your man.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.406
- Kelly!

02:55.743 --> 02:57.945
Kelly!

02:57.978 --> 03:00.581
Do it! Bring me down,
bring me down!

03:14.562 --> 03:15.696
Bring us up!

03:19.467 --> 03:20.868
Kelly...

03:20.901 --> 03:23.971
Talk to me.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.574
Kelly!
Kelly!

03:32.780 --> 03:34.348
Kelly.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.850
Can you hear me?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.488
- Easy.
- Got him.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.824
Got him, got him.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.297
- Nice and easy.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.500
Kelly!
- Watch his head.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.571
Kelly...

03:57.605 --> 04:00.374
- Come on, Lieutenant,
talk to us.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.348
- All right.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.522
- He's good.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.690
- He's fine.
- Come on, come on.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.858
- We got you.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.506
- What the hell were
you two thinking?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.642
We weren't.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.547
- That was incredible.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.532
- Get over here.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.401
You're not moving
the rest of the day.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.635
- I'm good.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.836
- Didn't we have
an understanding?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.938
No five-story jumps
into the river.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.476
- I told you, I'm trying
to qualify for Tokyo 2020.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.511
High dive, gold medal.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.079
I got to get my practice
in where I can.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.114
- Well, you didn't stick
the landing.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.450
- Oh, actually I think I did.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.486
- Hm.
- Tens from all the judges.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.787
Must have missed it.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.823
- I am happy to miss
any and all of that.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.091
Can I get you anything else?

05:24.124 --> 05:27.361
You want hot chocolate?
Apple cider?

05:28.829 --> 05:30.330
- You.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.703
- You always have me.
- Well...

05:35.736 --> 05:38.472
Then I don't need
anything else.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.024
- Boden called over to Med.

05:57.057 --> 06:01.429
Made Halstead's brother check
me out for a concussion.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.365
- Yeah, that's the one.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.638
- Uh, take some Tylenol.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.974
- More or less.

06:19.046 --> 06:23.183
- Okay, look, I'm supposed
to go into Molly's North

06:23.216 --> 06:26.887
to train some new bartender,
but I'm gonna cancel

06:26.920 --> 06:31.425
and just make
sure you're okay.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.962
Kelly?
- Mm-hmm.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.697
- Hey.
- Yeah. I'm okay.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.534
I'm just, uh...can you walk me
over to the couch?

06:40.568 --> 06:42.169
- Yeah, of course.
Come here.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.638
Here, come on.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.510
You good?
- Yeah.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.778
- Man, just breathe.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.012
What!

06:53.681 --> 06:55.949
- You--

06:55.983 --> 06:58.486
- Yeah, it's funny.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.787
I was kidding.
I'm fine.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.956
Get your ass to Molly's.
- Oh, gladly.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.028
You're a terrible person.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.534
- I want a clear-eyed
self-assessment.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.569
- I'm sore all over.
I'm not gonna lie.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.805
But good to go, Chief.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.473
- Went through
the concussion protocol.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.208
Flying colors.
Fine.

07:21.241 --> 07:24.144
- And if you weren't,
you wouldn't tell me anyway.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.515
Chief Huffhines.
- Wallace, Matt.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.583
- Kelly Severide, Chief.
- Kelly.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.853
See the coverage
in the "Sun

07:32.886 --> 07:34.688
- Yes, I did.
Very nice.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.189
Well, let me tell you,

07:36.223 --> 07:38.959
the office of public relations
has heard from everyone.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.828
The commissioner's office,
mayor's office.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.497
Everyone is tickled pink.
- I'm glad.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.699
- So I reached out
to the photographer

07:45.733 --> 07:49.102
who captured
these amazing photographs.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.839
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is, uh--

07:51.872 --> 07:53.974
- Nate Isaacs,
professional photo journalist.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.710
- Right, and I said
to Mr. Isaacs,

07:56.744 --> 07:58.979
I said, "Would you be
interested in doing

07:59.012 --> 08:02.550
a day-in-the-life
pictorial spread, huh?"

08:02.583 --> 08:05.586
A real inside look
at what we do here.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.054
And I could not think
of a better house

08:07.087 --> 08:09.657
than the one that produced
this stellar shot.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.759
- Okay, so when are
you thinking to, um--

08:11.792 --> 08:14.895
- Right now.
Today, this shift.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.132
- Chief, listen, if this
is an intrusion at all,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.868
you just tell me and I'll take

08:20.901 --> 08:23.871
a big step back,
just like at the scene.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.608
You tell me to move back,
and I do as I am told.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.180
- Okay, why not.
Great.

08:33.213 --> 08:36.784
Nate, I'll leave you to it.

08:36.817 --> 08:37.851
- Thanks.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.620
- So how do you want
to do this?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.054
- Uh, go about
your shift normally.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.823
At the end of the day,
we'll see what we have, huh?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.758
- Good.
- Okay.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.065
- I heard from Hope.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.802
- Yeah, she sent me an email,

08:54.835 --> 08:56.069
said she's back in Fowlerton.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.838
She wants to drive up
and have lunch

08:57.871 --> 09:00.273
so she can mend fences.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.210
- Delete.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.979
- Hey, so I am
alerting you, ladies,

09:06.013 --> 09:08.048
we have a photographer
in our midst.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.651
- It's some press guy.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.953
He's doing a day-in-the-life
photo shoot.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.926
- Help.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.561
Help, Dawson.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.365
It hurts.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.972
- It hurts.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.707
- He's a frequent flyer.
He's harmless.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.076
- It's broke.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.979
- Let me take a look, Gerald.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.381
- Okay, well, I don't think
it's broken,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.216
but we can get you to
the hospital.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.352
What happened?

09:45.385 --> 09:47.320
- I--I fell.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.991
- Home.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.961
- You walked all the way
over here?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.364
- Okay, listen, Gerald,
we're gonna get you a sling

09:57.397 --> 09:59.099
for your arm so you
won't keep cradling it.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.734
We're gonna take an x-ray
at the hospital

10:00.768 --> 10:02.703
just to make sure
it's not broken, okay?

10:02.736 --> 10:05.038
Come on.
- I got it.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.040
Come on, buddy.
Let me help you up.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.844
There we go.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.687
- That's the guy.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.054
Do you want me to tell him
to back off?

10:21.088 --> 10:22.255
- No, no, it's fine.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.058
Come on, Gerald.
Let's go.

10:32.232 --> 10:32.365
.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.200
- Hey, close the blinds
so we can hide

10:34.735 --> 10:36.269
from this photographer.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.343
- Psst, hey.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.313
He's hiding in here.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.420
- Oh.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.690
- Oh, uh.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.192
Actually, it can wait.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.829
- Well, don't mind me.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.230
- Okay.

11:03.263 --> 11:07.701
I just wanted to ask
if I could swap next week

11:07.735 --> 11:10.403
with Grigsby on third shift.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.174
I have a lead on an apartment

11:14.207 --> 11:18.746
and the building manager
wants to meet with me.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.485
- Oh, yeah, uh, sure.
No problem.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.221
Just write it down
on a sticky note,

11:28.255 --> 11:30.023
put it in my office.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.192
- Okay.
Will do.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.104
- Not on my end.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.374
I told her she could stay
as long as she wants.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.052
- Oh, my God.
She didn't.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.387
- Hope.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.222
You know how I deleted
her email?

12:02.255 --> 12:03.857
Now she's trashing me
on Facebook.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.292
- Nah.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.428
Hm.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.463
- These are mutual friends
she's stirring up in Fowlerton.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.099
Who knows what she's saying
in real life.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.801
- Oh, you got to drag her.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.769
You send out a blast,
and you let everybody back home

12:15.803 --> 12:17.470
know the stunts
that she pulled in Chicago.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.307
- Yeah, I saw these two
celebrities brawling on Twitter

12:20.340 --> 12:24.277
and it was everything.
Do something like that.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.547
You know what,
I'm just gonna

12:27.580 --> 12:31.184
go with my first instinct
and ignore her.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.053
- Come on, girl, you got
to stand up for yourself.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.823
- I stand up when it's
something worth standing up to.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.225
Hope isn't worth it.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.163
- Ambulance 61.
Man down from unknown causes.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.799
8451 Racine.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.170
- It's hyperbole.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.446
- Well there are
many guesses about that.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.849
The only plausible
one I heard is

13:01.882 --> 13:04.818
that this house was built
on an old goat farm.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.886
- Huh.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.223
No, no, no, just go
about your business.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.859
Ignore me.
- No, what we were gonna do

13:11.892 --> 13:13.460
is smoke a couple cigars.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.328
- You know, I could put
my camera down,

13:15.362 --> 13:18.832
and, uh, join you guys.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.237
How do you get impaled
on an iron fence?

13:24.271 --> 13:25.939
- He was trying to kill
himself.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.942
Jumped out a four-story window.
- Ouch.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.479
SGBS isn't fixing that, huh?
Super glue, baking soda.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.015
Medics in the field,
they swore by it.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.984
Said it was better than gauze
for packing a wound.

13:37.017 --> 13:40.420
- Afghanistan, five months.

13:40.453 --> 13:44.124
Of course, Chicago can be
its own war zone sometimes.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.227
Don't ask.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.596
I'm gonna shower
and change now.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.632
- Got a call, guy was
face down on Racine.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.267
Turned him over and...

13:54.301 --> 13:55.635
All over Dawson.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.537
50/50 chance
it could have been me.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.408
- Listen, I'm gonna go get
some coffee.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.410
Anybody want anything?

14:07.680 --> 14:11.284
- Be right back.
Nobody touch my cigar.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.553
- Don't worry.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.490
- Captain, did you get
a chance to look

14:17.524 --> 14:19.259
over my furlough request?
- Not yet.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.493
- Everybody wants
Fourth of July off.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.129
That's why I put
in five months early.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.396
- Okay, I'll be sure
to look at

14:23.430 --> 14:25.665
that pressing
concern after I, uh--

14:25.698 --> 14:27.901
- I need to know.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.523
- Casey!

14:51.191 --> 14:52.425
Hey, take it easy, man.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.465
- Found this scumbag lurking
outside your shower.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.268
- I had no idea that
these were co-ed bathrooms.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.303
- So you just decided to

15:03.336 --> 15:05.705
explore the bathroom
you didn't know was co

15:05.738 --> 15:08.575
Right after I said I was going
to take a shower?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.111
- Get out.
- Just hold on for a moment--

15:11.144 --> 15:12.512
- Get your camera and get out

15:12.545 --> 15:14.214
before I beat
the hell out of you.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.949
I mean it!

15:28.361 --> 15:31.631
- That was freaky.

15:42.709 --> 15:43.076
.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.581
- The photographer you brought

15:48.615 --> 15:52.285
into my firehouse was playing
peeping tom in the bathroom.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.225
- I, uh, I can't even--

15:58.258 --> 16:01.128
- It happened
while I was in the shower.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.530
- Uh.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.632
Okay, well, I'll,
uh--I'll call the paper.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.368
- And we'll call CPD.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.738
- I want a formal complaint.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.340
On the record.
- If it happened here,

16:13.373 --> 16:17.144
it ain't the first time.
Someone needs to know.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.679
- Well...

16:21.181 --> 16:23.550
You're right.
You're right, um.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.753
I'm, uh--I'm embarrassed
this happened.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.289
And I should have done
a better job at vetting him

16:29.322 --> 16:30.690
before I proposed this.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.159
It's not your fault.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.694
You just got caught up
in the buzz.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.031
Let me call the CPD, huh?

16:38.065 --> 16:41.068
I should be the one.
- I'll do it.

16:45.605 --> 16:49.176
- Okay.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.678
Again, uh...

16:51.711 --> 16:54.314
I'm sorry.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.690
*

17:03.723 --> 17:06.493
- Okay, we are
on the Blue Cobras.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.595
They'll announce it.
- Okay.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.198
So you have done this before?

17:11.231 --> 17:12.799
- Oh, I'm in league.
- Mm.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.601
- And we happen to have
a spot open for tonight

17:14.634 --> 17:16.536
which you're filling.
- Mm.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.339
Oh, I will bring it.
Don't you worry.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.542
- Uh, how's the apartment
search coming?

17:22.575 --> 17:23.776
- Ah, I got a lead.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.346
- Yes. Yeah.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.381
- You excited about
living alone again?

17:30.783 --> 17:33.220
- Oh, my God,
you play WhirlyBall?

17:33.253 --> 17:35.188
- Hi.
- She is a first-timer.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.823
- Hi, Stella.
- Lily.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.258
- Brian and I are thinking of

17:38.291 --> 17:40.093
going on
the championship circuit.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.095
- I'm not gonna say we
perfected the Malachi Crunch

17:42.129 --> 17:44.164
but, uh--

17:44.197 --> 17:46.499
- Uh, the, um--

17:46.533 --> 17:49.169
- Next up on Court 2,
the Dig Dug Express

17:49.202 --> 17:51.404
against the Blue Cobras.
- That's us.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.873
both: Us too.
- Mm.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.376
You guys are going so down.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.644
*

17:57.677 --> 17:59.746
- Okay.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.151
- Sure.
Thanks.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.458
- Okay, look,
I'm not one to pry,

18:11.491 --> 18:15.728
but as your bartender,
I got responsibilities.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.898
So, what's going on?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.601
Oh, come on,
maybe I can help.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.603
I've seen stuff.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.905
- It's my girlfriend, Alice.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.475
She wants to move in,
but I think it's too soon.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.178
- It's only been six months.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.546
What's your name, pal?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.648
- Kevin.
- Okay, Kevin.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.317
Look at it like this, okay?

18:37.350 --> 18:40.720
Life, it's like a fire.
- Oh, boy.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.222
- You go in too far too fast,

18:42.255 --> 18:44.491
you're gonna get
burnt up, right?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.159
- I guess.
- Yeah.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.495
But if you throw water
on too soon,

18:48.528 --> 18:50.830
you know, you're in
a rush to cool it down,

18:50.863 --> 18:52.632
then you are going to boil
those firefighters

18:52.665 --> 18:56.203
like, you know,
a bunch of lobsters.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.905
- Okay.
- So, listen.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.540
You and Alice,
you got some heat, right?

19:00.573 --> 19:02.342
- I think so.
- Well, what you got to try

19:02.375 --> 19:05.212
to figure out is,
is it the kind of heat

19:05.245 --> 19:07.247
that you want to run into

19:07.280 --> 19:09.282
or you want to run out of?
- Yeah, I don't think

19:09.316 --> 19:11.218
that's a usefu--
- No, actually,

19:11.251 --> 19:14.254
that makes total sense.
- Yeah.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.121
See?

19:16.389 --> 19:18.691
- Thanks, man.
I really appreciate it.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.527
- You got it.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.196
- That was pretty good,
what you did over there.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.533
I'm just helping out
where I can.

19:29.936 --> 19:33.440
Oh. "Mitchell Monroe,
Life Coach Managers."

19:33.473 --> 19:34.841
Whoo.
- I'm a talent manager

19:34.874 --> 19:36.276
for life coaches.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.478
I help turn, you know, advice

19:38.511 --> 19:40.947
into a profitable business.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.550
- Okay.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.218
Tell me more about profitable.

19:45.252 --> 19:48.221
- Well, my coaches charge
$40 an hour to start.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.290
I provide the training,
I manage the paperwork

19:50.323 --> 19:52.859
and the invoices,
I take 10% off the top.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.766
- Something you seem
to be doing pretty naturally

19:59.799 --> 20:01.234
from what I just witnessed.

20:01.268 --> 20:05.372
Your words of wisdom,
they have value.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.007
- You give me a call

20:08.040 --> 20:10.310
when you're ready
to take the next step.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.422
Hey.
- Hey.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.958
Have you played
WhirlyBall before?

20:25.992 --> 20:28.528
Because it is not
as easy as it looks.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.800
Oh, yeah, well, I mean
we should get a team together.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.703
Otis and Lily are,
like, regulars.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.339
And then Zach knows
the manager,

20:39.372 --> 20:42.842
so, you know, I mean we could
go whenever we wanted.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.412
- Sounds interesting.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.548
- Are you, uh,

20:48.581 --> 20:51.684
you staying up?
- Nah, I'm gonna go to bed.

20:51.718 --> 20:55.855
'Cause it's me
and you, I can, uh,

20:55.888 --> 20:57.557
I can rally.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.858
- Nah, it's okay.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.593
Gonna get some shut-eye.

21:05.532 --> 21:06.999
- Okay.

21:12.739 --> 21:19.912
*

21:36.796 --> 21:36.929
.

21:36.963 --> 21:37.430
- Could have been worse.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.899
- Oh, had he taken
pictures of you?

21:39.932 --> 21:41.100
- No, I mean for him.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.535
Matt was about
to rip his head off,

21:42.569 --> 21:43.903
and I was ready to help.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.638
He's lucky to be alive.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.612
Gerald?

21:57.083 --> 21:58.851
- Uh...

21:59.886 --> 22:01.788
I--I need medicine.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.494
- It hurts.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.661
- Okay, we're gonna
get you something

22:08.695 --> 22:09.929
out of the back
of the ambulance.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.598
Just give us a second here.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.670
What do you think?

22:18.738 --> 22:20.507
- I think he's being
messed with.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.942
He walks all the way
over here, twice?

22:27.714 --> 22:30.417
- F. I.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.386
R. E.
Fire!

22:33.420 --> 22:36.022
The reason why you are here
is you need to get your life

22:36.055 --> 22:39.659
in order, and I am here
to help you with that.

22:39.692 --> 22:44.096
- "F" stands for

22:44.130 --> 22:45.665
fire pole.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.933
The thing that connects

22:46.966 --> 22:50.570
the two floors
of a firehouse is a pole.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.072
- Pole starts with a "P."

22:53.105 --> 22:55.808
- It's a fire pole.
Fire.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.844
It is always there
when you need it,

22:57.877 --> 23:00.647
and in an emergency,
it will help you

23:00.680 --> 23:02.915
quickly get to the things
that you need.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.017
Yes, Joseph?
- Why are you doing

23:05.051 --> 23:06.686
this thing so formal?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.521
The thing that makes you unique

23:08.555 --> 23:10.122
is that you are not formal.

23:10.156 --> 23:14.093
- Clients are going to pay
a lot of money for this.

23:14.126 --> 23:17.697
- Uh-huh.
- You need to, um,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.766
"show them that you
are a professional

23:19.799 --> 23:23.703
in dress and manner
and in method."

23:23.736 --> 23:25.438
- Well, continue then.

23:25.472 --> 23:26.806
- Thank you.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.975
- Mm-hmm.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.627
Mm-hmm.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.118
- Hey, Lester.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.522
How's your foot?
- It's a lot better, thanks.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.124
You looking for Gerald?

24:18.157 --> 24:20.827
- Uh, no, actually,
we know where Gerald is.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.730
Do you know if anyone's
bothering him?

24:25.665 --> 24:27.900
- Hey, it's okay.
You can tell us.

24:29.268 --> 24:32.505
- I don't want nothing
to do with this.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.276
*

24:37.309 --> 24:39.546
- That's Gerald's tent
right there.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.089
- Hey, whoever's
in Gerald's tent

24:50.122 --> 24:51.824
needs to come out.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.870
- That's Gerald's house.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.805
- Not no more.
- Come on, let's go.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.640
- No, Dawson, no.
- This is my house.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.076
This is my street.
Go home, skanks.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.945
- No, this is not your street.
It's mine.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.181
Along with his
and his and theirs.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.016
You know who else's
streets these are?

25:17.049 --> 25:19.318
Every paramedic
and firefighter in Chicago.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.853
We've been on every block
in this city

25:20.887 --> 25:22.555
and helped someone
on every one of them.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.890
And all those people
we've helped,

25:23.923 --> 25:25.892
they're on our team,
not yours.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.695
You mess with Gerald again
or anyone else in this camp,

25:28.728 --> 25:30.029
then you'll be picking
a fight with us

25:30.062 --> 25:31.698
and everyone
that's loyal to us,

25:31.731 --> 25:34.601
and then you'll find out
whose streets these are.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.925
- She used to be my friend.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.293
- Are you sure you don't want
to go to the shelter, Gerald?

26:02.394 --> 26:05.732
- You call us if anybody
messes with you again, okay?

26:16.375 --> 26:17.877
I think I will email Hope back.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.345
Tell her straight up
I'm not interested in

26:19.378 --> 26:20.847
anything she has to say,

26:20.880 --> 26:22.949
just so there's
no misunderstandings.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.125
- Just thought I'd drop
in with some cookies.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.360
- Aw.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.963
I swear you are an angel.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.665
- Good time for it.
- Hey!

26:38.698 --> 26:40.767
- We're losing all faith
in humanity around here.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.902
- Worse.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.171
Pervert came
into the firehouse.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.673
- Thanks.
- Oh, good.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.908
All right,
question for the group.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.843
I am gonna need some help

26:50.877 --> 26:53.646
getting this life coach thing
off the ground.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.683
- Why don't I be
your first client?

26:56.716 --> 26:58.818
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, great!

26:58.851 --> 27:02.021
Done! You are not gonna
be disappointed.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.790
Okay, let's, uh,

27:03.823 --> 27:06.425
get you signed up, and then
we'll get you started.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.827
Okay?

27:09.829 --> 27:11.731
- Mm. You said.
- No, okay, I didn't--

27:11.764 --> 27:13.365
- We'll just go on back here.

27:13.399 --> 27:14.834
I got stuff to talk about.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.705
- You see the "F"

27:18.738 --> 27:21.874
is for you're--

27:38.791 --> 27:41.260
- Brett was awesome as always.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.262
- I just got off the phone

27:43.295 --> 27:45.097
with both the "Sun-Times"
and "The Tribune."

27:45.131 --> 27:47.366
They said they're severing
all ties with Nate Isaacs

27:47.399 --> 27:50.102
and will blast his name to
all the press in the area.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.104
They assured me they
took it very seriously.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.806
- Good riddance.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.843
- Well, I thought you would
like to know.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.878
- You thought right.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.483
- Really good actually.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.854
He's a very wise man.

28:07.887 --> 28:10.022
- Really, really.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.490
Yeah, I told him
about my sister,

28:11.523 --> 28:13.225
and he said I should
reach out to her

28:13.259 --> 28:16.195
which is what I've been
thinking for a long time.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.300
- Then we started to talk
about Hawaii.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.035
You know, how I wanted to go
there after college

28:23.069 --> 28:24.436
but my parents put the kibosh

28:24.470 --> 28:26.205
on that particular dream.

28:26.238 --> 28:29.041
He said, "Sometimes ladders
don't reach the highest floor,

28:29.075 --> 28:31.510
but we have to
hump up the stairs,"

28:31.543 --> 28:33.345
which is really solid advice.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.515
So, yeah, I'm gonna
think about it.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.787
- You know, moving to Hawaii.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.922
Anyway, today was really fun.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.323
I'll see you tomorrow
at Molly's North?

28:44.356 --> 28:46.759
- Yeah.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.227
Definitely.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.066
Right after I murder someone.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.254
- Hey.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.856
- Hey.

29:29.101 --> 29:32.805
I just think things are
getting weird between us.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.107
- It's not weird for me.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.945
- Look, I'd like to say
what I mean.

29:38.978 --> 29:42.214
You know I'm not much
for dancing around subjects.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.983
- Me either.

29:46.285 --> 29:51.157
- Um, it's just this Zach guy
is really cool.

29:51.190 --> 29:56.362
And we have a lot
of fun together.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.464
And it may get serious.

29:58.497 --> 30:02.869
Who knows? It feels like
it's heading in that direction.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.941
But you...

30:11.310 --> 30:13.179
are so special to me.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.414
And, um...

30:16.448 --> 30:18.317
so important.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.992
And I just feel like
it'll--it'll

30:26.025 --> 30:30.029
clear up a lot
of things once I move out.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.174
Okay?

30:43.609 --> 30:45.878
All right, well, um,

30:45.912 --> 30:49.515
thank you for, uh,
listening to that.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.987
- Do you want to hear
my opinion?

30:58.457 --> 31:00.993
- Yeah.

31:01.928 --> 31:05.097
- I don't want you to leave.

31:09.936 --> 31:14.173
- Truck 81, Ambulance 61.
Single vehicle accident.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.209
500 block West Harrison Street
Eastbound.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.500
- Crowd control,
block off the sidewalk.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.602
Give us some room to work.
Otis, Mouch, with me.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.004
Stand back, sir.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.305
Excuse me.
Stand back, please.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.275
Ma'am, can you tell us
what happened?

31:49.308 --> 31:51.210
- I don't know, I just
looked down for a second.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.644
And the car started spinning.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.214
- We're gonna have
our medics take a look, okay?

31:55.247 --> 31:57.149
- Back up.
Thank you.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.118
Okay.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.354
Captain.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.360
- Hey!

32:08.694 --> 32:10.362
Get off the scene.

32:10.396 --> 32:11.697
- I got a right to be here.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.199
- I ain't asking.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.433
- Freedom of the press, buddy.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.103
You can try to
destroy my name

32:17.136 --> 32:20.272
but I can still sell photos
of public employees

32:20.306 --> 32:22.174
wherever and whenever I want!

32:22.208 --> 32:25.411
- Casey, don't.
He's not worth it.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.117
You all right?
- I'm okay.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.252
- Hey, you gonna give us
the room to do our jobs?

32:33.285 --> 32:35.421
- It's a public street, lady.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.992
- Okay, I guess.
- We can get her out

32:40.026 --> 32:41.593
as soon as we pop the door.

32:55.141 --> 32:55.441
.

32:55.474 --> 32:55.974
- Call for a second ambo!

32:57.076 --> 32:58.344
- Casey!

33:03.282 --> 33:04.350
*

33:17.663 --> 33:20.232
- Pulse is strong.
He's alert.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.236
- You stepped in the street
and got hit by a car.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.438
But the captain saved you.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.026
- One hell of a call.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.096
- Could say that.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.463
- Herrmann says
you didn't hesitate.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.065
Not for a second.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.803
- Nope.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.140
- That's good.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.676
'Cause I'm not.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.178
- And what if the man
you saved today

34:06.212 --> 34:09.381
is different from the one
he was yesterday?

34:09.415 --> 34:11.417
- You think he's
magically reformed

34:11.450 --> 34:13.685
because he got hit by a car?
- No.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.687
I think if we start
wondering if one life

34:15.721 --> 34:17.489
has more value than another,

34:17.523 --> 34:19.458
we can't do our job.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.595
Today you gave Isaacs the
second half of his life back.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.431
You can't control
what he does with it.

34:28.167 --> 34:31.170
But a life saved...

34:31.203 --> 34:32.571
That's one for the win column.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.506
I will take that win any day,

34:34.540 --> 34:36.408
no matter who it is.

34:36.442 --> 34:39.245
*

34:39.278 --> 34:41.580
So...

34:44.483 --> 34:46.652
I am proud of you, Captain.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.369
- Isaacs is stable.

35:03.402 --> 35:06.272
Well, you know,
physically anyway.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.640
What, too soon?

35:10.576 --> 35:11.843
- Yeah.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.881
- Well...

35:15.914 --> 35:17.583
Thank you.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.887
- For being the sort of man who
will protect me from a creep.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.791
And then run into traffic
to save the creep.

35:26.725 --> 35:30.162
I love you.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.897
- I love you too.

35:33.432 --> 35:35.201
- Two, three, and four.

35:35.234 --> 35:38.237
- 10%. I had my first client.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.872
And it went pretty damn well
if I do say so myself.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.741
- We can settle up
when you get a few more.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.444
- All right.
- Speaking of which,

35:45.477 --> 35:49.548
I need a check
from you for $800.

35:50.882 --> 35:52.784
- Well, I added you
to my gold roster

35:52.818 --> 35:54.553
which is
for active life coaches

35:54.586 --> 35:56.388
who have completed
the bronze workbook

35:56.422 --> 35:58.524
which you did.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.792
- You!
Me?

36:00.826 --> 36:02.528
- I took your stupid advice.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.196
I told Alice
that moving in with her

36:04.230 --> 36:05.697
made me feel like
I was being cooked alive.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.633
- Listen, I didn't say
to say that.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.801
I definitely didn't tell
you to say that.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.403
- She dumped me!
- Look.

36:11.437 --> 36:12.671
I mean, you--

36:12.704 --> 36:13.739
- Hey, hey, take it easy.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.407
- You ruined my life.

36:15.441 --> 36:18.310
- Okay, buddy.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.782
- So that was a setback.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.323
- I think that
you need to leave.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.293
Okay.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.662
That's all right.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.864
Excuse me.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.003
- Listening to me for advice

36:45.036 --> 36:47.873
might be the dumbest thing
that you could do.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.375
- No.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.510
Lily was very appreciative.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.012
- Yeah.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.749
You gave her some excellent
things to think about.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.987
- Well, you know what,
you tell her

37:02.020 --> 37:03.955
that I don't think
that I'm gonna be

37:03.989 --> 37:06.258
in, you know,
life coaching business anymore.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.993
I'm gonna stick
with what I know.

37:08.026 --> 37:11.497
Firefighting
and running this bar.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.665
Actually I
might run over to Molly's North

37:13.699 --> 37:16.735
right now and let her know
that before she decides.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.437
Cover for me.
- Yeah.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.239
You got it, buddy.

37:23.609 --> 37:24.743
- Something to get you started.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.412
- Thank you.
- Ooh.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.980
Fancy.
Fancy.

37:29.014 --> 37:32.884
Oh, my God, Severide would be
completely busting my balls

37:32.918 --> 37:34.853
about eating
in a place like this.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.956
He's always like,
"Lou Malnati's is all I need."

37:37.989 --> 37:39.591
And I'm like, "No, sometimes

37:39.625 --> 37:42.661
a girl's gotta be wined
and dined."

37:46.031 --> 37:49.000
Mm. I...

37:49.034 --> 37:53.639
I didn't--I was,
uh--that was rude.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.774
Let's talk about you.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.977
- No, no, no sweat.
It's all good.

38:03.349 --> 38:06.051
Actually, you know what?
There is...

38:06.084 --> 38:08.019
There is something I wanted
to talk to you about.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.822
I wasn't sure
if it was too soon.

38:16.595 --> 38:19.531
- Okay, well, my sister

38:19.565 --> 38:20.932
is gonna be in town next week.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.669
And she's cool, and I think

38:23.702 --> 38:26.405
you'd like each other so...

38:26.438 --> 38:31.743
I wanted to know
if you want to meet her?

38:32.611 --> 38:34.746
- Of course.
Yes.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.349
Yes, I would love to.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.488
- Good.
- Mm-hmm.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.544
- I tried to text you.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.045
- My phone's on the charger.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.615
- Just seeing
if you were around.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.550
- Yeah, come on in.

39:14.620 --> 39:17.556
- Uh-oh, did Kelly
get stood up tonight?

39:17.589 --> 39:18.757
- Nah, I just wanted to hang

39:18.790 --> 39:20.526
with the old married couple
tonight.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.060
Oh, so sweet.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.162
I'll grab the wine.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.898
- I will grab the beers.
- Yeah.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.141
- Yeah.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.612
Thank you.

39:40.646 --> 39:42.548
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.450
- Cheers, guys.

39:47.486 --> 39:54.526
*

40:12.711 --> 40:13.011
.

40:15.781 --> 40:22.954
