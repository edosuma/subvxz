ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

01:54.500 --> 01:59.324
Trash,
as in trailer trash...

01:59.330 --> 02:01.821
THEY'RE 20 MINUTES LATE
WITH MY VIOXX AGAIN.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.195
Trash ?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.792
Why not ?
That's what you are.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.596
RAMONA ?

02:07.060 --> 02:09.199
I'M IN SUCH PAIN.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.157
RAMONA ?

02:12.160 --> 02:14.822
UGH, I'M IN SUCH AGONY.

02:14.830 --> 02:18.789
I WISH THE GOOD LORD
WOULD TAKE ME SOON.

02:19.730 --> 02:21.857
RAMONA !

02:21.860 --> 02:24.454
SO, HOW ARE THINGS AT HOME
WITH YOU AND RICO ?

02:24.460 --> 02:25.859
HE'S STILL
ACTING CRAZY ?

02:25.860 --> 02:27.157
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM,

02:27.160 --> 02:28.650
BUT HE DEFINITELY
HAS A BUG UP HIS ASS.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.127
MID-LIFE CRISIS.

02:30.130 --> 02:32.189
HE'S TOO YOUNG
FOR THAT.

02:32.200 --> 02:36.421
OH, HONEY, MEN START
HAVING THEIR MID-LIFE CRISIS
IN THEIR EARLY 20$,

02:36.430 --> 02:38.022
AND THEY
KEEP ON HAVING THEM

02:38.030 --> 02:39.759
EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS
AFI'ER THAT.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.194
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EAT
MORE THAN THIS, MRS. KIPPLEMAN.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.191
OH, SHIT.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.326
NOW WHAT ?

02:45.330 --> 02:48.151
VANESSA,
SHE'S GOT NO PULSE.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.320
OH, SHIT.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.752
SHE'S A FULL COLD ?

02:55.760 --> 02:56.954
I DON'T KNOW.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.928
C'MON, EDITH,
C'MON.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.750
A WORLD-CLASS
COMPLAINER LIKE YOU

03:00.760 --> 03:02.318
ISN'T GONNA
GIVE UP THAT EASY.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.690
HOW ABOUT THESE ?

03:18.700 --> 03:20.895
THE GREEN PANTS.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.198
ACTUALLY,
THESE ARE OLIVE.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.418
I CAN GET MYSELF DRESSED,
YOU KNOW ?

03:25.430 --> 03:27.227
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP.

03:27.230 --> 03:28.629
DID I ASK
FOR YOUR HELP ?

03:28.630 --> 03:30.450
NO.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.257
THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM ?

03:32.260 --> 03:33.420
HEY !

03:33.430 --> 03:34.897
YOU DON'T TALK
TO DAVID THAT WAY.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.925
YOU'D BETTER START SHOWING
SOME RESPECT AROUND HERE.

03:36.930 --> 03:38.955
OR WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA
PUT ME IN JAIL ?

03:38.960 --> 03:40.188
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?

03:40.200 --> 03:41.656
LET HER GO.

03:41.660 --> 03:43.059
WE'VE GOT TO START SE'I'I'ING SOME
SERIOUS BOUNDARIES WITH HER.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.551
LOOK AT ALL THE SHIT SHE'S HAD
TO DEAL WITH IN HER LIFE,

03:45.560 --> 03:47.653
NOT TO MENTION
THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.127
SHE'S NINE.

03:49.130 --> 03:50.222
I KNOW
HOW OLD SHE IS.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.527
I'M JUST SAYING--

03:51.530 --> 03:52.849
YOU WANT TO PICK A FIGHT
WITH ME THIS MORNING ?

03:52.860 --> 03:54.828
NO, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO PICK
A FIGHT WITH A NINE-YEAR-OLD

03:54.830 --> 03:56.354
ABOUT HER A'I'I'ITUDE ?

03:56.360 --> 03:57.657
THIS MORNING I DO.

03:57.660 --> 03:59.651
WELL, TOO FUCKING BAD.

03:59.660 --> 04:01.525
I KNOW YOU'RE NERVOUS ABOUT
YOUR OLD MAN COMING TO VISIT,

04:01.530 --> 04:03.452
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO LET YOU
TAKE IT OUT ON TAYLOR,

04:03.460 --> 04:04.893
ORME!

04:11.460 --> 04:13.121
IT'S HALF PAST NINE.

04:13.130 --> 04:14.358
SO?

04:17.300 --> 04:18.449
LET ME SLEEP LATE.

04:18.460 --> 04:19.893
IT'S THE LAST ENJOYMENT
I'LL KNOW

04:19.900 --> 04:21.458
BEFORE I BECOME
ANOTHER COG IN THE WHEEL,

04:21.460 --> 04:23.655
MAKING MOCHA LATI'ES
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LIFE.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.594
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE DRAMATIC ?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.420
NOT REALLY.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.898
CAN I MAKE YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT ?

04:29.900 --> 04:31.925
NO, THANKS.

04:31.930 --> 04:35.229
YOU NEVER EAT
A DECENT BREAKFAST ANYMORE.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.457
THIS IS A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE,
THIS IS AN APPLE.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.020
THAT'S TWO OF
MY DAILY SERVINGS OF FRUIT

04:41.030 --> 04:42.691
RECOMMENDED BY
THE U.S.D.A.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.998
CLAIRE,
ARE YOU DEPRESSED ?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.050
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.893
WELL, WHATEVER
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

04:52.900 --> 04:54.754
I HOPE YOU DON'T
BLAME ME !

04:54.760 --> 04:56.398
( door slamming )

04:59.860 --> 05:01.293
( door opening )

05:01.300 --> 05:03.120
HEY, I WAS JUST
CALLING YOU.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.722
WHAT, YOU CAN BE
LATE ALL YOU WANT,

05:04.730 --> 05:06.152
BUT I'M NOT
ALLOWED TO BE ?

05:06.160 --> 05:07.821
WHOA, CALM DOWN.

05:07.830 --> 05:09.320
WHY ?
I'M PISSED OFF.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.355
I GET PISSED OFF SOMETIMES,
I HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPRESS IT.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.998
WELL, EXPRESS IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE,

05:13.000 --> 05:14.558
BECAUSE I GO'I'I'A RUN.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.925
BRENDA AND I ARE HAVING
A MEETING WITH RABBI ARI.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.727
YOU'RE THINKING
OF CONVERTING ?

05:17.730 --> 05:19.049
AH, MAYBE.

05:19.060 --> 05:22.291
WHAT ?
I'M ALREADY CIRCUMCISED.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.997
ANYTHING I NEED
TO BE AWARE OF HERE ?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.594
YES, I DID A PICKUP
THIS MORNING AT BAY BREEZE.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.999
ANOTHER REFERRAL
FROM VAN ESSA.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.752
GREAT, ANOTHER CHANCE
FOR RICO TO ACT LIKE

05:30.760 --> 05:32.489
WE OWE OUR ENTIRE
LIVELIHOOD TO HIM.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.151
( male )
HELLO, MR. FISHER ?

05:35.160 --> 05:37.526
DAVE, YOU GOTTA
LIGHTEN UP, MAN.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.756
CAN I HELP YOU ?

05:40.760 --> 05:42.398
ARE YOU
NATHANIEL FISHER ?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.628
NO, HE'S DECEASED--

05:43.630 --> 05:45.325
WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT'S ME.

05:45.330 --> 05:47.025
I'M NATHANIEL FISHER,
JUNIOR.

05:47.030 --> 05:49.658
CONSIDER YOURSELF
SERVED.

05:52.530 --> 05:56.819
( door opening
and closing )

05:58.100 --> 06:00.250
OH, SHIT.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.023
WHO WAS THAT ?

06:02.030 --> 06:04.851
YOU REMEMBER
MRS. COLLINS ?

06:04.860 --> 06:08.057
THAT WAITRESS WHO GOT LOCKED IN
THE WALK-IN OVERNIGHT ?

06:08.060 --> 06:10.358
NO, THE WIFE OF THE GUY
WHO FELL OFF THE BOAT

06:10.360 --> 06:11.588
GOT SLICED UP
BY THE PROPELLER ?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.488
OH, YEAH,
THE BARGAIN HUNTER.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.196
SHE WANTED
TO SEE THE BODY.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.953
YOU DIDN'T.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.450
SHE MADE ME.

06:20.460 --> 06:21.722
NATE--

06:21.730 --> 06:23.550
AND NOW SHE'S SUING US
FOR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.357
TO THE TUNE OF
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.725
FUCK !

06:29.000 --> 06:31.093
THERE'S AN ASHTRAY
OVER THERE SOMEWHERE.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.922
YOU SHOULD REALLY CLEAN
THIS CAR OUT SOMETIME, YOU KNOW.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.849
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THIS ?

06:39.860 --> 06:42.727
OH, IT'S SOME CREEPY THING

06:42.730 --> 06:44.698
MY AUNT SARAH SENT ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.850
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED,

06:46.860 --> 06:48.691
'CAUSE USUALLY SHE HAS
PRETTY GOOD TASTE.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.919
IT'S FILLED WITH SOME NASTY
CHINESE HOLISTIC HERB-SHIT.

06:53.460 --> 06:55.348
NEWS FLASH,
THESE AREN'T CHINESE HERBS.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.157
THEY'RE NOT ?

06:57.160 --> 06:59.253
THESE ARE 'SHROOMS.

06:59.260 --> 07:02.650
MY AUNT SENT ME
MUSHROOMS ?

07:02.660 --> 07:05.254
WHATEVER YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE DOING TOMORROW,

07:05.260 --> 07:06.659
PLAN ON
BLOWING IT OFF.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.991
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH TODAY ?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.592
I HAVE A DATE
WITH MR. SCHUSSLER.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.421
MR. SCHUSSLER,
THE VOCATIONAL ARTS TEACHER ?

07:12.430 --> 07:13.624
YEAH.

07:13.630 --> 07:16.428
AND YOU CAN'T FUCK FOR SHIT
WHEN YOU'RE ON 'SHROOMS.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.323
MARRIAGE IS
A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE,

07:20.330 --> 07:22.594
THAT CAN DEEPLY
ENRICH YOUR LIFE,

07:22.600 --> 07:24.989
AND EVEN BRING YOU
CLOSER TO GOD.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.321
BUT OUR CULTURE HAS MANY
MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT IT,

07:27.330 --> 07:30.390
LIKE, MARRIAGE
WILL CURE LONELINESS.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.550
OR THAT MOST OF OUR
SATISFACT IONS IN LIFE

07:32.560 --> 07:34.653
SHOULD COME FROM
OUR PARTNER,

07:34.660 --> 07:37.424
OR THAT GOOD SEX
MEANS GOOD MARRIAGE.

07:37.430 --> 07:41.389
THE TRUTH IS THAT MARRIAGE IS
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.528
SO, IN THIS AND
OUR NEXT FIVE SESSIONS,

07:44.530 --> 07:47.328
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS TO YOU.

07:47.330 --> 07:49.025
I'M CURIOUS,

07:49.030 --> 07:51.225
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN MARRIED ?

07:51.230 --> 07:52.959
NO, I HAVEN'T.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.222
OH.

07:54.230 --> 07:56.448
BUT I HAVE COUNSELED
MANY COUPLES IN MY CONGREGATION,

07:56.460 --> 07:58.621
BOTH BEFORE, DURING,
AND AFTER MARRIAGE,

07:58.630 --> 08:00.848
AND THE ONE THING
I CAN SAY WITHOUT HESITATION

08:00.860 --> 08:03.420
IS THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE
A GOOD MARRIAGE WITHOUT HONESTY.

08:03.430 --> 08:04.829
WELL, YEAH.

08:04.830 --> 08:07.219
THAT KIND OF GOES
WITHOUT SAYING, DOESN'T IT ?

08:07.230 --> 08:09.755
( organs playing )

08:09.760 --> 08:12.627
ARE YOU COMPLETELY HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER ?

08:14.460 --> 08:17.725
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.893
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
TO THINK ABOUT FOR NEXT WEEK.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.150
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME CUCUMBER SALAD ?

08:35.160 --> 08:36.821
NO, THANK YOU.

08:36.830 --> 08:38.457
I MADE
MORE THAN ENOUGH.

08:38.460 --> 08:40.758
I READING PAPER.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.529
FINE.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.755
NIKOLAI...

08:48.760 --> 08:50.022
YURI.

08:50.030 --> 09:00.452
( speaking Russian )

09:06.130 --> 09:08.690
TAKE IT, GO AHEAD
TAKE IT !

09:14.630 --> 09:16.518
I'LL BE BACK,

09:16.530 --> 09:18.418
LIKE TERMINATOR, NO ?

09:24.560 --> 09:25.857
( door slamming )

09:26.630 --> 09:28.996
WHAT IS HE ?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.695
DID HE THREATEN YOU ?

09:30.700 --> 09:33.498
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
WOMAN !

09:39.230 --> 09:42.154
OKAY, CAN I JUST SAY THAT
I THINK THAT TOTAL HONESTY

09:42.160 --> 09:44.321
IS NOT ALWAYS
THE BEST THING.

09:44.330 --> 09:46.321
YOU KNOW,
WHAT ABOUT PRIVACY ?

09:46.330 --> 09:49.959
WHAT ABOUT TRYING TO MAINTAIN
THE MYSTERY OF A RELATIONSHIP ?

09:49.960 --> 09:54.226
AND SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES
TRUTH IS IRRELEVANT.

09:54.230 --> 09:57.757
BRENDA,
I DID SOMETHING STUPID.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.721
I'M LISTENING.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.755
THE TRIP TO SEATTLE,
MY FRIEND LISA ?

10:10.860 --> 10:13.749
I SLEPT WITH HER,
SHE'S PREGNANT.

10:22.560 --> 10:27.554
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO RESPOND
TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.194
WELL, WHAT DO YOU FEEL ?

10:32.200 --> 10:36.296
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL,
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.589
I FEEL NUMB.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.391
WHEN WERE YOU
PLANNING ON TELLING ME ?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.698
I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

10:47.700 --> 10:51.818
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO WITH THIS INFORMATION ?

10:51.830 --> 10:53.491
I DON'T--

10:53.500 --> 10:54.819
I MEAN, CHRIST, NATE !

10:54.830 --> 10:56.354
THIS WHOLE WEDDING THING
SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME,

10:56.360 --> 10:57.918
BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO MAKE MYSELF BELIEVE

10:57.930 --> 11:00.091
THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY...

11:09.200 --> 11:10.656
AH.

11:16.130 --> 11:18.928
( door closing )

11:18.930 --> 11:19.828
ALMOST DONE.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.227
OKAY.

11:24.430 --> 11:26.125
OKAY.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.092
OKAY, THEN.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.019
HOW BAD IS IT ?

11:34.030 --> 11:35.895
YOUR BROTHER
SHOWED HER THE BODY ?

11:35.900 --> 11:37.049
YES.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.652
IT WAS IN PRETTY
BAD SHAPE, HUH ?

11:38.660 --> 11:40.093
YES.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.126
HERE'S WHAT I THINK.

11:43.130 --> 11:44.950
I THINK SHE'S GOT
A PRETTY AIR-TIGHT CASE.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.928
I THINK THAT YOU GUYS
ARE MORE OR LESS FUCKED.

11:46.930 --> 11:48.852
SHE MADE HIM
SHOW HER THE BODY.

11:48.860 --> 11:51.055
AND I CAN CERTAINLY
ARGUE THAT POINT.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.755
BUT, DAVID,
SHE WAS UNDER DURESS.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.194
AND THIS WOMAN IS GOING
TO DESCRIBE IN GREAT DETAIL

11:55.200 --> 11:57.054
EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAW
WHEN SHE IS UP ON THE STAND.

11:57.060 --> 12:00.393
ON TOP OF THAT,
SHE'S HIRED HERSELF
A VERY AGGRESSIVE LAW FIRM

12:00.400 --> 12:01.992
THAT NOBODY
LIKES TO MESS WITH.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.956
SO, I THINK THAT
WE SHOULD TRY TO SETTLE.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.757
HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ?

12:07.960 --> 12:09.951
HEY, SORRY I WAS LATE.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.097
WHERE WERE YOU ?

12:11.100 --> 12:12.397
I WAS WITH BRENDA,
I JUST LOST TRACK OF THE TIME,

12:12.400 --> 12:14.652
WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING PRETTY INTENSE.

12:14.660 --> 12:16.594
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH TROUBLE WE ARE IN

12:16.600 --> 12:18.192
BECAUSE OF
THIS LAWSUIT ?

12:18.200 --> 12:19.690
LOOK, I HAVE THINGS
I GOTTA DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.122
YEAH, I HAVE A LIFE, TOO !

12:21.130 --> 12:22.791
I HAVE A KID NOW !

12:22.800 --> 12:24.825
BUT AT LEAST I TRY TO KEEP IT
SEPARATE FROM THE BUSINESS

12:24.830 --> 12:27.094
THAT YOU SEEM SO HELLBENT
ON FLUSHING DOWN
THE FUCKING TOILET !

12:28.260 --> 12:29.295
DAVID--

12:29.300 --> 12:30.722
WE ARE FUCKED, NATE !

12:30.730 --> 12:33.051
AND YOU FUCKED US.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.224
I'M JUST AFRAID THAT
MY DAUGHTER'S SUFFERING
FROM DEPRESSION

12:39.230 --> 12:41.391
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.289
WELL, MOST TEENAGERS
SUFFER FROM MILD DEPRESSION

12:44.300 --> 12:46.052
AT ONE TIME
OR ANOTHER.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.197
IS THAT TRUE ?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.792
WELL, TRUE ENOUGH.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.927
BUT I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR
WITH CLINICAL DEPRESSION,

12:50.930 --> 12:53.649
AND I JUST DON'T SEE CLAIRE
SUFFERING FROM THAT.

12:53.660 --> 12:55.298
YOU DON'T ?

12:55.300 --> 12:58.690
LOOK, CLAIRE IS,
SHE'S THE KIND OF PERSON

12:58.700 --> 13:00.850
THAT NEEDS HER LIFE
TO BE MEANINGFUL.

13:00.860 --> 13:02.589
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THIS
BETTER THAN I DO.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.090
NO, I DON'T FEEL
AS THOUGH I DO.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.655
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

13:09.660 --> 13:11.924
SHE HAS NO IDEA
HOW EASY SHE'S HAD IT !

13:11.930 --> 13:15.149
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN DO

13:15.160 --> 13:17.253
TO BE MORE SUPPORTIVE
OF CLAIRE RIGHT NOW ?

13:17.260 --> 13:19.854
OF COURSE,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,
I THINK.

13:23.460 --> 13:26.998
THIS IS A BROCHURE
FOR LAC-ARTS.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.822
I THINK CLAIRE SHOULD
THINK ABOUT GOING THERE.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.424
IT'S A GREAT SCHOOL FOR SOMEONE
WITH HER CREATIVITY.

13:33.430 --> 13:36.399
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
SHE'S DEPRESSED ?

13:36.400 --> 13:37.753
I DON'T.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.490
BUT CAN I SPEAK CANDIDLY ?

13:40.500 --> 13:42.252
PLEASE.

13:42.260 --> 13:46.629
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT YOU MIGHT BE.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.790
( answering machine beeping )

13:51.800 --> 13:53.199
HEY, IT'S ME,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.122
LEAVING ANOTHER GODDAMN MESSAGE
ON YOUR VOICE MAIL.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.724
LISTEN, UH...

13:57.730 --> 14:02.326
I REALLY NEED
TO TALK, I'M...

14:03.830 --> 14:07.789
BILLY, GODDAMNIT,
I NEED YOU !

14:07.800 --> 14:11.190
I REALLY NEED YOU.

14:12.730 --> 14:15.654
GODDAMNIT,
WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU ?

14:23.400 --> 14:26.028
( tv )
On the tennis courts
top-seated...

14:26.030 --> 14:29.022
( door closing )
6-love, 6-3 winner
over Sweden.

14:29.030 --> 14:30.554
MR. CHARLES, HEY.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.495
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:35.060 --> 14:38.552
YOU MET ME WHEN KEITH BROUGHT ME
DOWN TO SAN DIEGO LAST...

14:38.560 --> 14:40.858
WELL, IT'S BEEN
OVER A YEAR AGO--

14:40.860 --> 14:42.191
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.792
DAVID !

14:43.800 --> 14:45.950
HEY, LUCILLE,
I'M SORRY I'M SO LATE.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.520
GUESS I MISSED
DINNER, HUH ?

14:49.160 --> 14:50.798
I LEFT YOU A PLATE
IN THE MICROWAVE.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.199
THANK YOU.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.622
( door opening )

14:53.630 --> 14:56.155
HEY, YOU'RE HOME.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.618
I'M SORRY I'M SO LATE,
DID YOU GET MY--

15:00.900 --> 15:02.197
WHERE'S TAYLOR ?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.428
BRUSHING HER TEETH.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.421
DID SHE FLOSS FIRST ?

15:05.430 --> 15:06.727
YES, I WATCHED HER.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.493
LISTEN, I PUT
FRESH LINENS ON.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.354
EXTRA BLANKETS
IN THE HALL CLOSET.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.351
KEITH, YOUR MOTHER AND I WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.396
CAN'T IT WAIT
UNTIL MORNING ?

15:14.400 --> 15:15.822
NO, I DON'T
THINK IT CAN.

15:15.830 --> 15:17.388
I CAN LEAVE THE ROOM,
IF YOU'D LIKE.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.288
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE HERE
FOR THIS OR NOT.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.349
KEITH, WE'D LIKE
TO TAKE TAYLOR HOME WITH US

15:22.360 --> 15:24.419
WHEN WE GO BACK
TO SAN DIEGO.

15:24.430 --> 15:26.398
WHAT, FOR A VISIT ?

15:26.400 --> 15:27.799
NO, TO LIVE.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.153
WHY ?

15:29.160 --> 15:30.457
THIS ISN'T ANY
OF YOUR CONCERN, SIR.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.688
I'M SORRY,
BUT I THINK IT IS--

15:31.700 --> 15:34.897
NO, DAVID,
LET'S HEAR HIM OUT.

15:34.900 --> 15:38.051
WELL, FOR ONE,

15:38.060 --> 15:40.551
WE HAVE A YARD BIG ENOUGH
FOR HER TO PLAY IN.

15:40.560 --> 15:42.721
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HER.

15:42.730 --> 15:44.755
AND WE'LL BE ABLE
TO OFFER HER MORE...

15:44.760 --> 15:46.728
STABILITY.

15:46.730 --> 15:49.551
IT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILD
AND YOU KNOW IT.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.290
FINE.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.258
(female on tv)
I think the mirror on
the handle is the fat mirror.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.091
( laughing )
Look.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.920
( male on tv)
I think you're right.

16:00.930 --> 16:04.195
( doorbell ringing )

16:09.160 --> 16:11.025
ARI.

16:11.030 --> 16:12.099
HI.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.727
I'M SORRY TO JUST DROP IN
LIKE THIS SO LATE,

16:13.730 --> 16:16.255
BUT I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
WELL, NEARBY,

16:16.260 --> 16:19.320
SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY
WHO'S INTERESTED IN
ARRANGING A FUNERAL.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.855
HIS OWN, ACTUALLY,
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT ?

16:21.860 --> 16:22.929
A PRE-NEED.

16:22.930 --> 16:24.192
RIGHT.

16:24.200 --> 16:28.125
SO, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP HIM ?

16:28.130 --> 16:31.099
YEAH, SURE, JUST GIVE ME
HIS NAME AND NUMBER,

16:31.100 --> 16:32.727
I'LL CALL HIM
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

16:32.730 --> 16:33.822
OKAY.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.295
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

16:37.300 --> 16:38.597
YEAH, I'M GREAT.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.694
OKAY, THAT'S BULLSHIT.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.055
I'M COMING IN AND YOU'RE GONNA
OFFER ME SOMETHING TO DRINK.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.157
WOW.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.924
THAT IS A LOT
FOR HER TO ABSORB.

16:52.330 --> 16:55.458
WELL, SHE ALREADY
KNEW ABOUT THE AVM.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.894
BUT I JUST TOLD HER
ABOUT THE BABY TODAY.

16:59.430 --> 17:01.728
YOU SAID WE'D NEVER HAVE
A GOOD MARRIAGE WITHOUT HONESTY.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.618
I DID SAY THAT,
DIDN'T I ?

17:03.630 --> 17:04.551
YEP.

17:06.800 --> 17:10.054
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE

17:10.060 --> 17:12.119
BEING HONEST
WITH BRENDA ?

17:12.130 --> 17:15.099
I DON'T THINK
IT'S PARTICULAR TO BRENDA.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.954
WELL, WITH WOMEN, THEN.

17:16.960 --> 17:20.418
I DON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE
BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.057
I'M A RABBI, NATE.

17:22.060 --> 17:23.789
YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE A RABBI.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.655
I AM A RABBI.

17:26.660 --> 17:30.255
UNAVAILABLE TO YOU,
NOT EVEN IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS.

17:30.260 --> 17:33.388
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAVE
TROUBLE BEING HONEST WITH ME.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.652
THERE'S NOTHING
AT STAKE.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.224
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
BECOMING A FATHER ?

17:41.230 --> 17:44.996
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.925
I CERTAINLY NEVER IMAGINED
IT WOULD HAPPEN LIKE THIS.

17:51.030 --> 17:53.521
ALL OF OUR ACTIONS
HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.090
WE MAY NOT EVEN
BE AWARE OF THEM,

17:56.100 --> 17:59.854
BUT THEY EXIST
N EVERTH ELESS.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.889
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT
A BLESSING.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.221
WHAT IF YOU
HAD NEVER KNOWN ?

18:12.400 --> 18:14.391
SORRY.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.654
JUST GIVE HER
SOME TIME, NATE.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.291
TIME, RIGHT.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.850
WOW, WE GOT ANOTHER ONE
FROM BAY BREEZE.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.657
THAT'S LIKE
THE FOURTH ONE THIS YEAR.

18:53.660 --> 18:54.991
YES, FEDERICO.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.025
I'M AWARE OF HOW MANY REFERRALS
YOUR WIFE SENDS OUR WAY.

18:57.030 --> 19:01.148
JUST MAKING SURE YOU KNOW WHERE
THE BUSINESS IS COMING FROM.

19:04.530 --> 19:07.522
SOMETHING FUNNY
ABOUT THIS ONE, DAVID.

19:07.530 --> 19:08.656
FUNNY HOW ?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.649
THE DEATH CERTIFICATE
SAYS THE CAUSE OF DEATH

19:16.660 --> 19:18.321
WAS CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

19:18.330 --> 19:20.594
SO, OLD PEOPLE HAVE THEIR HEART
QUIT ON THEM ALL THE TIME.

19:20.600 --> 19:24.320
YEAH, BUT SHE'S GOT THESE
CONTUSIONS AROUND HER NECK.

19:26.060 --> 19:29.791
OLD PEOPLE
BRUISE EASILY.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.018
THOSE PROBABLY HAPPENED
WHILE THEY WERE TRYING
TO RESUSCITATE HER.

19:32.030 --> 19:34.055
YEAH, MAYBE.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.022
OH, WHAT THE FUCK ?

20:02.030 --> 20:05.056
A HOT DOG ?

20:05.060 --> 20:07.358
NOW, YOU TELL ME,
I DON'T THINK SOMETHING THIS BIG

20:07.360 --> 20:09.590
JUST HAPPENED TO GO
DOWN THE WRONG WAY.

20:17.860 --> 20:20.499
IS IT OKAY IF PARKER SPENDS
THE NIGHT AT OUR HOUSE TONIGHT ?

20:20.500 --> 20:21.899
OF COURSE.

20:21.900 --> 20:25.119
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PICK YOU UP
A FROZEN PIZZA AND SOME VIDEOS ?

20:25.130 --> 20:27.826
UM, NO,
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

20:31.160 --> 20:34.197
ARE YOU DOING SOMETHING
WITH NIKOLAI TONIGHT ?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.998
I THINK HE'S LOSING
INTEREST IN ME.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.798
HE'S BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME ALONE LATELY.

20:39.800 --> 20:45.193
MOM, HE WAS LIVING HERE
WITH PLASTIC CASTS ON BOTH LEGS

20:45.200 --> 20:47.828
AND PEEING IN A BEDPAN FOR WHAT,
LIKE, SIX WEEKS ?

20:47.830 --> 20:49.593
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

20:49.600 --> 20:52.353
JUST GIVE HIM
SOME SPACE.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.952
GUYS NEED
A LOT OF SPACE.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.656
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW
TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF

20:56.660 --> 20:58.389
AND HE NEEDS MY HELP!

20:58.400 --> 21:01.153
IF YOU SAY SO.

21:09.630 --> 21:12.258
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED
ABOUT THIS TERM, "PRE-NEED".

21:12.260 --> 21:14.524
IT'S A PAYMENT STRUCTURE
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO--

21:14.530 --> 21:16.157
MAKE THE PURCHASE
BEFORE YOU NEED IT.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.422
I GET THAT.

21:17.430 --> 21:19.125
I MAY BE DYING,
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

21:19.130 --> 21:21.018
MY QUESTION IS WITH
THE CHOICE OF THE WORD "NEED".

21:21.030 --> 21:23.658
I MEAN, WHO REALLY
NEEDS A FUNERAL ANYWAY ?

21:23.660 --> 21:25.890
IF YOU'RE DEAD,
YOU DON'T NEED SHIT.

21:25.900 --> 21:29.051
WELL, YES,
THE FUNERAL IS REALLY

21:29.060 --> 21:30.857
FOR THE PEOPLE
YOU LEAVE BEHIND.

21:30.860 --> 21:33.055
TO HELP THEM
COME TO TERMS--

21:33.060 --> 21:34.618
WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING ANYBODY BEHIND ?

21:34.630 --> 21:37.554
WHAT IF YOUR
WHOLE FUCKING LIFE

21:37.560 --> 21:40.097
HAS BEEN ONE BIG WASTE OF TIME
FOR EVERYBODY,

21:40.100 --> 21:42.022
INCLUDING YOURSELF ?

21:42.030 --> 21:44.021
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

21:44.030 --> 21:48.626
HEY, I'M ALL FOR
THINNING OUT THE HUMAN RACE.

21:48.630 --> 21:51.428
THERE ARE JUST
TOO MANY FUCKING PEOPLE.

21:51.430 --> 21:56.754
ANTHRAX, SMALLPOX,
I SAY BRING IT ON.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.297
YOU'D PROBABLY
LIKE THAT, HUH ?

21:59.300 --> 22:01.325
GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

22:01.330 --> 22:04.128
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
LEAVE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU

22:04.130 --> 22:05.757
AND I'LL COME BACK LATER.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.059
SORRY IF
I'M BEING ANTISOCIAL.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.399
SIT DOWN.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.720
THE GOOD RABBI
WENT THROUGH ALL THE TROUBLE
OF SETTING THIS UP.

22:24.730 --> 22:29.053
BESIDES, I MAY NOT
BE HERE TOMORROW.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.523
YOU MIND IF I ASK--

22:33.530 --> 22:35.418
WHAT I HAVE ?

22:36.900 --> 22:38.492
PANCREATIC CANCER.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.354
I'M SORRY.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.124
IT'S ONE OF
THE WORST ONES YOU CAN GET.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.992
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.820
YEAH.

22:49.830 --> 22:52.390
I SHOULD BE
DEAD ALREADY.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.096
SO, THIS...

22:55.100 --> 22:58.194
THIS IS JUST
GRAW TIME.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.089
IT'S EXTRA FROSTING
ON THE CAKE.

23:01.100 --> 23:05.150
MOST PEOPLE LAST UP
TO MAYBE SIX MONTHS TOPS.

23:05.160 --> 23:09.620
ME, I'VE BEEN HANGING IN HERE
FOR OVER A YEAR.

23:09.630 --> 23:13.225
CAN YOU FUCKING
BELIEVE IT ?

23:13.230 --> 23:17.098
I'LL BET YOU NEVER MET ANYBODY
HALF AS LUCKY AS I AM.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.360
AND YOU PULLED THIS,
RELATIVELY INTACT,

23:20.360 --> 23:22.453
OUT OF THE DECEASED'S
AIRWAY ?

23:22.460 --> 23:23.927
THAT'S CORRECT.

23:23.930 --> 23:25.955
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO LOOK IN HER THROAT ?

23:25.960 --> 23:29.623
WELL, I WOULD'VE
GONE IN THERE ANYWAY,

23:29.630 --> 23:31.848
TO SWAB HER OUT BEFORE
I STARTED EMBALMING HER,

23:31.860 --> 23:34.522
BUT I HAD
MY SUSPICIONS.

23:34.530 --> 23:37.226
WHAT MADE YOU
SUSPICIOUS ?

23:37.230 --> 23:39.221
THE CONTUSIONS
AROUND HER NECK.

23:39.230 --> 23:42.199
YOU KNOW, THESE CONTUSIONS
COULD'VE BEEN MADE

23:42.200 --> 23:43.724
WHEN THEY TRIED
TO RESUSCITATE HER.

23:43.730 --> 23:45.254
THEY COULD HAVE.

23:45.260 --> 23:47.319
BUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE
AND THEY TRIED TO RESUSCITATE,

23:47.330 --> 23:49.457
WHY DIDN'T THEY FIND
THE FRANKFURTER
STUCK IN HER AIRWAY ?

23:49.460 --> 23:51.496
IT WAS STUCK
PRETTY FAR DOWN.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.651
SOME OF THESE NURSING HOMES
AREN'T EXACTLY UP TO SPEED

23:54.660 --> 23:56.525
ON THEIR
CPR TRAINING.

23:56.530 --> 23:58.919
SHE WAS BROUGHT OVER FROM
THE BAY BREEZE NURSING HOME

23:58.930 --> 24:00.397
IN SHERMAN OAKS ?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.458
THAT'S CORRECT.

24:01.460 --> 24:03.519
AND WHO TRIED
TO RESUSCITATE HER ?

24:03.530 --> 24:05.395
I THINK I GOT THAT.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.153
HERE, IT SAYS
DOLORES WILLITS...

24:08.160 --> 24:10.799
AN D VAN ESSA,
DIAL--

24:10.800 --> 24:13.018
DIAZ.

24:13.030 --> 24:17.558
VAN ESSA DIAZ,
SHE IS MY WIFE.

24:27.230 --> 24:28.822
WHERE IS NIKOLAI ?

24:28.830 --> 24:30.593
HE'S OUT
ON A DELIVERY.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.752
WELL, TELL HIM I STOPPED BY
AND I COME BACK LATER.

24:34.760 --> 24:37.991
HOW MUCH MONEY
DOES NIKOLAI OWE YOU ?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.195
EXCUSE ME ?

24:40.200 --> 24:42.191
HOW MUCH MONEY
DOES NIKOLAI OWE YOU ?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.020
WHO ARE YOU ?

24:44.030 --> 24:46.089
I'M HIS FRIEND.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.720
HIS LADY FRIEND.

24:51.730 --> 24:53.027
THAT'S RIGHT.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.998
IT IS NONE
OF YOUR CONCERN.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.458
TELL ME HOW MUCH HE OWES YOU
AND I'LL PAY YOU THE MONEY.

24:59.930 --> 25:03.991
YOU WILL PAY ME
THE MONEY ?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.490
TELL ME
HOW MUCH IT IS.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.456
$87,000.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.894
OH, MY.

25:09.900 --> 25:13.051
I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS THAT MUCH.

25:13.060 --> 25:15.051
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT
KIND OF MONEY, DO YOU ?

25:19.230 --> 25:21.824
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.994
YOU WOULD DO THIS
FOR NIKOLAI ?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.854
PLEASE,
I'M TRYING TO COUNT.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.427
NIKOLAI'S
A LUCKY MAN.

25:55.030 --> 25:57.123
WHAT IS YOUR NAME ?

25:57.130 --> 25:58.552
RUTH.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.699
RUTH FISHER.

26:00.700 --> 26:04.693
I WOULD'VE TAKEN A CHECK,
RUTH FISHER.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.424
( door closing )

26:15.000 --> 26:17.651
( music playing )

26:17.660 --> 26:21.289
OH, NO, NO,
NO, NO

26:21.300 --> 26:28.490
NO, NO, NO...

26:28.500 --> 26:32.857
WHOA,
NO, NO, NO

26:32.860 --> 26:37.991
OH, BABY
I JUST SAW THE DEVIL

26:38.000 --> 26:41.424
AND HE'S SMILING AT ME

26:41.430 --> 26:45.890
I HEARD IN MY BONES
CRY DEVIL

26:45.900 --> 26:50.553
WHY'S IT GOT TO BE

26:50.560 --> 26:52.596
WELL, WHO'S THIS
PRETTY LITTLE GIRL

26:52.600 --> 26:54.352
WHO WANTS TO
JOIN THE PARTY ?

26:54.360 --> 26:56.328
ISN'T IT WAY PAST
YOUR BEDTIME, HONEY ?

26:56.330 --> 27:00.755
( Margaret)
BRENDA, HONEY,
MOMMY AND DADDY HAVE COMPANY,

27:00.760 --> 27:03.456
AND YOU NEED TO GO BACK
UP TO BED RIGHT THIS MINUTE !

27:03.460 --> 27:06.452
( Bernard )
MARGARET, YOU'RE STIGMATIZING
THE SITUATION FOR HER.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.520
( Margaret)
NO, I'M NOT BERN.

27:12.830 --> 27:14.320
WHOA

27:14.330 --> 27:18.221
KEITH, YOU CANNOT
LET THEM TAKE MY BABY.

27:18.230 --> 27:20.755
KARLA, THEY'RE ONLY
AS FAR AWAY AS SAN DIEGO.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.399
I THINK IT'S
FOR THE BEST.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.459
THERE AIN'T NO FUCKING WAY
IT'S FOR THE BEST !

27:25.460 --> 27:27.257
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

27:27.260 --> 27:29.319
DADDY DIDN'T EVEN
NEED AN EXCUSE

27:29.330 --> 27:30.922
TO SMACK THE SHIT
OUT OF ME OR YOU !

27:30.930 --> 27:32.625
AND LOOK WHAT
THAT DID TO US.

27:32.630 --> 27:34.120
LOOK WHAT THAT
DID TO YOU.

27:34.130 --> 27:37.019
I DON'T WANT TAYLOR
GROWING UP WITH THAT SHIT !

27:37.030 --> 27:39.658
BUT YOU DON'T MIND HER
GROWING UP WITH A MOTHER

27:39.660 --> 27:41.127
WHO'S A DRUG ADDICT ?

27:41.130 --> 27:43.894
I MIGHT BE A DRUG ADDICT,
BUT I NEVER HURT MY CHILD.

27:43.900 --> 27:46.027
THAT'S THE WAY PEOPLE
RAISED THEIR KIDS BACK THEN.

27:46.030 --> 27:47.793
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF YOU

27:47.800 --> 27:49.688
BLAMING EVERYTHING THAT'S
GONE WRONG IN YOUR LIFE ON DAD.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.190
PLEASE.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.498
YOU KNOW HOW
THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE THING
WOULD JUST SET HIM OFF.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.024
I THINK HE'S CHANGED.

27:55.030 --> 27:57.021
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE.

27:57.030 --> 28:00.295
PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE.

28:00.300 --> 28:04.396
THEY JUST GET OLDER,
THAT'S ALL.

28:12.060 --> 28:14.528
DAVID FISHER,
HOW THE HELL ARE YA ?!

28:14.530 --> 28:16.122
JESUS.

28:16.130 --> 28:19.725
CERTAINLY NOT IN ANY MOOD
TO DEAL WITH THE LIKES OF YOU.

28:19.730 --> 28:23.029
OH, HONEY, YOU COULD STAND
TO WORK ON THOSE MANNERS.

28:23.030 --> 28:24.429
HI, NATE.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.796
I UNDERSTAND
YOU BOYS ARE BEING SUED.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.427
YEAH, SO WHAT,
YOU'VE COME HERE TO GLOAT ?

28:28.430 --> 28:31.058
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT WE ARE PAYING

28:31.060 --> 28:33.290
POOR MRS. COLLINS'
LEGAL FEES,

28:33.300 --> 28:35.825
AND HONEY, WE'VE GOT
AWFULLY DEEP POCKETS.

28:35.830 --> 28:38.697
Y'ALL, THIS THING IS GONNA
GO ON FOREVER AND IN THE END,

28:38.700 --> 28:41.453
IT'S GONNA DRAG YOU BOYS DOWN,
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT.

28:41.460 --> 28:43.951
NOW, WE ARE STILL
WILLING TO BUY

28:43.960 --> 28:46.656
THIS LITTLE MOM AND POP
SHOP OF YOURS

28:46.660 --> 28:48.389
AT A DRASTICALLY REDUCED PRICE,
I'M AFRAID,

28:48.400 --> 28:50.595
BUT I THINK THAT
IF YOU'RE SMART,

28:50.600 --> 28:52.454
AND I'M BETTING
THAT YOU ARE,

28:52.460 --> 28:55.395
YOU'LL GO ON AND GET OUT
WHILE THE GETTING'S
STILL HALFWAY GOOD.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.049
I'M CURIOUS, MITZI.

28:57.060 --> 28:58.527
WHAT DO YOU
GET OUT OF THIS ?

28:58.530 --> 28:59.952
I LIKE TO WIN, HONEY.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.393
THAT'S THE WAY
I WAS BROUGHT UP.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.322
I HOPE YOU DON'T EXPECT ME
TO APOLOGIZE FOR IT,

29:03.330 --> 29:05.093
'CAUSE I'M NOT
GONNA DO IT.

29:05.100 --> 29:06.795
I DON'T EXPECT
ANYTHING FROM YOU.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.689
BUT I DO WONDER,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

29:09.700 --> 29:11.520
WHEN YOU'RE ALONE,
STARING AT YOURSELF
IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR,

29:11.530 --> 29:14.055
DO YOU REALLY LIKE WHO YOU SEE
LOOKING BACK AT YOU ?

29:14.060 --> 29:16.449
I LOVE WHAT I SEE.

29:16.460 --> 29:19.054
SEE, I JUST
DON'T BUY THAT.

29:19.060 --> 29:20.857
'CAUSE IF YOU DID,

29:20.860 --> 29:22.589
YOU WOULDN'T
BE DOING THIS.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.388
YOU KNOW, IT'S A CRYING SHAME
SOMEONE AS CUTE AS YOU

29:26.400 --> 29:29.551
HAS TO BE SUCH A GODDAMN
"DOOM-AND-GLOOMER".

29:29.560 --> 29:33.758
WELL, YOU BOYS THINK IT OVER
AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU DECIDE.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.853
PERSONALLY, I THINK
IT'S A NO-BRAINER,

29:35.860 --> 29:39.227
BUT HEY, EVERYONE'S ENTITLED
TO THEIR OWN OPINION.

29:41.130 --> 29:43.189
BUT I DON'T
HAVE THE MONEY.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.428
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY ?

29:44.430 --> 29:45.624
OF COURSE
YOU HAVE THE MONEY.

29:45.630 --> 29:46.927
NO, I DON'T,
IT'S ALL GONE.

29:46.930 --> 29:48.158
WHERE DID IT GO ?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.388
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.549
MOM.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.596
WE NEED THAT MONEY IN ORDER
TO OFFER MRS. COLLINS

29:52.600 --> 29:54.591
SOME KIND OF SETTLEMENT
OR WE'RE SERIOUSLY SCREWED.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.990
THE ONLY TIME YOU TWO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIVES

29:58.000 --> 29:59.524
IS WHEN
YOU NEED MONEY !

29:59.530 --> 30:01.088
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS BEFORE,

30:01.100 --> 30:02.795
( door slamming )
THE MONEY WOULD'VE BEEN THERE,
NOW IT'S GONE.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.052
UM, YOU GUYS,
THIS IS MY FRIEND PARKER.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.857
HI.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.825
BYE.
WE'RE JUST GONNA
BE UPSTAIRS.

30:10.830 --> 30:12.593
( giggling )

30:18.200 --> 30:20.498
I GIVE UP.

30:26.230 --> 30:28.198
THAT WAS WEIRD.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.690
THAT WAS TOTALLY WEIRD.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.156
ARE THEY ALWAYS
LIKE THAT ?

30:31.160 --> 30:33.299
ALWAYS.

30:40.500 --> 30:44.823
OH, MY GOD,
YOUR ROOM IS SO BEAUTIFUL !

30:44.830 --> 30:48.197
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ?

30:48.200 --> 30:50.851
UM...

30:50.860 --> 30:52.999
I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.252
WHAT DO YOU
FEEL LIKE DOING ?

30:55.260 --> 30:58.252
I FEEL LIKE
THROWING UP.

30:58.260 --> 30:59.557
ME, TOO.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.050
IS IT NORMAL ?

31:01.060 --> 31:03.756
TOTALLY, TOTALLY.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.626
THESE 'SHROOMS
ARE FUCKING KICK-ASS !

31:07.630 --> 31:10.895
HOLY SHIT, YOU HAVE
A SEWING MACHINE ?

31:10.900 --> 31:12.959
YEAH, I FOUND IT
IN THE ATTIC,

31:12.960 --> 31:16.191
IT BELONGED
TO MY DAD'S MOM.

31:17.730 --> 31:19.152
LET'S MAKE SOMETHING !

31:19.160 --> 31:20.855
DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO USE IT ?

31:20.860 --> 31:22.157
YEAH !

31:22.160 --> 31:23.889
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S SO FUCKING COOL.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.720
OH, MY GOD.

31:25.730 --> 31:28.153
PEOPLE USED TO HAVE TO MAKE
THEIR OWN CLOTHES ALL THE TIME,

31:28.160 --> 31:30.720
PEOPLE USED TO HAVE
TO MAKE THEIR OWN SOAP,

31:30.730 --> 31:32.948
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ?

31:32.960 --> 31:35.121
PEOPLE USED TO HAVE TO LIKE,
KILL THEIR OWN COWS AND STUFF.

31:35.130 --> 31:38.156
I REALLY WISH WE COULD'VE
BEEN ALIVE BACK THEN.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.320
ME, TOO.

31:50.630 --> 31:52.154
( phone ringing )

31:52.160 --> 31:54.594
( Brenda on answering machine )
Hi, it's me.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.352
I'm not here,
so, talk to the machine.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.248
( beeping )

32:03.560 --> 32:06.449
THANK YOU FOR SEEING ME,
MRS. COLLINS.

32:06.460 --> 32:09.850
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE,
FOR THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT

32:09.860 --> 32:11.589
THAT BRINGS US TO THIS...

32:11.600 --> 32:14.421
UNPLEASANT JUNCTURE.

32:14.430 --> 32:18.150
MY BROTHER IS NEW
TO THIS BUSINESS.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.151
HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS DOING

32:20.160 --> 32:22.299
WHEN HE SHOWED YOU
YOUR HUSBAND'S REMAINS.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.723
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM,
IS IT ?

32:25.460 --> 32:28.054
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

32:28.060 --> 32:32.156
YOU WERE VULNERABLE
WHEN YOU ASKED HIM TO DO THIS

32:32.160 --> 32:34.355
AND HE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.952
BUT NEVERTHELESS
YOU DID ASK HIM.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.222
WHAT'S YOUR POINT ?

32:37.230 --> 32:39.323
WHAT'S MY POINT ?

32:39.330 --> 32:40.251
YEAH.

32:40.260 --> 32:42.558
DO YOU EVEN HAVE ONE ?

32:46.760 --> 32:49.251
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MY FAULT
OR MY BROTHER'S FAULT

32:49.260 --> 32:50.796
THAT YOU
ALLOWED YOUR HUSBAND

32:50.800 --> 32:52.597
TO SMACK YOU AROUND
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.022
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

32:54.030 --> 32:55.622
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO TALK ABOUT MY MARRIAGE.

32:55.630 --> 32:57.928
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO BE
A DOORMAT OR A PUNCHING BAG

32:57.930 --> 33:00.421
OR WHATEVER METAPHOR
FOR VICTIMHOOD
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

33:00.430 --> 33:03.024
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO STAYED
IN AN ABUSIVE MARRIAGE

33:03.030 --> 33:06.124
AND WASTED GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY YEARS OF YOUR LIFE.

33:06.130 --> 33:07.597
YEARS THAT YOU'LL
NEVER GET BACK

33:07.600 --> 33:09.454
AND THAT MAKES YOU FURIOUS,
DOESN'T IT ?

33:09.460 --> 33:11.189
YOU'VE PROBABLY SPENT
YOUR ENTIRE MISERABLE LIFE

33:11.200 --> 33:13.395
BLAMING OTHER PEOPLE FOR
ALL THE MISTAKES YOU'VE MADE.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.425
AND NOW YOU WANT US
TO PAY FOR THAT ?

33:15.430 --> 33:18.297
JESUS, LADY,
JUST HOW FUCKING LOW
ARE YOU WILLING TO SINK ?

33:18.300 --> 33:22.088
THIS LAWSUIT OF YOURS IS GONNA
COST MY FAMILY OUR BUSINESS !

33:22.100 --> 33:25.024
THAT'S MY POINT !

33:29.360 --> 33:31.225
THERE !

33:31.230 --> 33:32.652
ARE YOU HAPPY ?

33:32.660 --> 33:34.753
NOW GET OUT !

33:34.760 --> 33:38.093
GET THE FUCK OUT
OF MY HOUSE !

33:45.430 --> 33:49.594
( music playing )

34:02.760 --> 34:04.819
YO.

34:04.830 --> 34:06.525
CAN YOU
SPARE A JOINT ?

34:38.060 --> 34:39.948
I LOVE HALTER TOPS !

34:39.960 --> 34:43.020
YOU LOOKIN'
AT MY TITS ?

34:43.030 --> 34:44.657
I'M TALKIN' TO YOU.

34:44.660 --> 34:46.389
YEAH, YOU.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.493
YOU LOOKIN' AT
MY TITS ?

34:50.230 --> 34:53.290
OH, MY GOD, I WISH
I COULD'VE LIVED
DURING THE RENAISSANCE.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.552
THOSE ARE
SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.858
I LOVE THOSE PANTS.

34:57.860 --> 35:01.352
( bells ringing )
SO, WHEN YOU WALK,
IT MAKES MUSIC, RIGHT ?

35:02.530 --> 35:04.725
IF WE LIVE OUR LIVES
THE RIGHT WAY,

35:04.730 --> 35:07.790
THEN EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO
BECOMES A WORK OF ART.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.098
EVEN LIKE
THE PANTS WE WEAR.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.796
OR JUST LIKE THE WAY
WE MAKE OUR BED, YOU KNOW ?

35:12.800 --> 35:14.199
WOW.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.327
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE
FUCKING PROBLEM WITH
THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,

35:16.330 --> 35:19.652
WE DON'T TRY TO BE CREATIVE
WITH EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.594
MARTHA STEWART DOES.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.227
( Ruth knocking )
CLAIRE ?

35:24.960 --> 35:26.951
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE GETTING HUNGRY,

35:26.960 --> 35:28.689
SO, I MADE YOU GIRLS
SOME SANDWICHES.

35:28.700 --> 35:31.396
WE ARE
SO NOT HUNGRY.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.855
WE'LL EAT THEM LATER.

35:34.860 --> 35:37.920
ALRIGHT THEN.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.149
I'LL COME BACK LATER
TO GET THE TRAY.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.196
MOM ?

35:43.200 --> 35:44.394
YES, DEAR ?

35:44.400 --> 35:47.198
HERE, I MADE
THESE PANTS FOR YOU.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.749
THANK YOU, CLAIRE.

35:52.530 --> 35:55.124
TH ESE ARE LOVELY.

35:55.130 --> 35:58.293
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.428
I NEVER TELL YOU
HOW MUCH,

36:01.430 --> 36:03.227
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID TO
FOR SOME REASON,

36:03.230 --> 36:05.289
BUT RIGHT NOW I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVE YOU,

36:05.300 --> 36:07.291
I THINK
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

36:07.300 --> 36:10.224
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

36:17.300 --> 36:22.590
( breathing heavily)

36:42.860 --> 36:45.852
YOU DON'T KNOW
MY DAD, DAVID.

36:45.860 --> 36:46.929
HE'S LIKE A PIT BULL

36:46.930 --> 36:48.420
WHEN HE GETS HIS JAW
LOCKED ON SOMETHING.

36:48.430 --> 36:49.954
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.621
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KEITH
WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT

36:51.630 --> 36:52.995
FOR SOMETHING
HE BELIEVES IN ?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.649
FOR SOMETHING
WE BOTH BELIEVE IN ?

36:54.660 --> 36:56.355
THIS ISN'T THAT SIMPLE.

36:56.360 --> 36:59.158
ARE YOU TAKING HIS SIDE
BECAUSE LOOKING AFTER TAYLOR

36:59.160 --> 37:00.491
IS TOO MUCH
OF A COMMITMENT ?

37:00.500 --> 37:03.196
NO, I'M TAKING HIS SIDE BECAUSE
FOR ONCE I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.124
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK ?

37:09.130 --> 37:10.950
I THINK YOU'RE NOT SURE
THAT TWO GAY MEN

37:10.960 --> 37:12.325
SHOULD RAISE A CHILD.

37:18.230 --> 37:20.118
THAT'S YOUR SHIT.

37:20.130 --> 37:21.688
THEN WHY AREN'T
WE FIGHTING FOR HER ?

37:21.700 --> 37:24.294
BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE TIME
TO SPEND WITH HER.

37:24.300 --> 37:25.494
OH, PLEASE.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.092
YOUR FATHER PLAYS GOLF
ALL GODDAMN DAY,

37:27.100 --> 37:28.920
AND YOUR MOTHER PLAYS
WITH HER FOR HALF-AN-HOUR TOPS,

37:28.930 --> 37:31.296
THEN POPS IN A VIDEO
AND GETS ON THE PHONE.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.325
LOOK, I AM NOT AMBIVALENT
ABOUT WANTING KIDS.

37:33.330 --> 37:35.719
OH, THEN WHAT, YOU'RE AMBIVALENT
ABOUT WANTING KIDS WITH ME ?

37:35.730 --> 37:37.197
OF COURSE NOT.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.519
I JUST WANT
TO BE READY.

37:38.530 --> 37:40.225
LIFE DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY.

37:40.230 --> 37:41.925
IT JUST DUMPS THINGS
IN YOUR LAP

37:41.930 --> 37:43.659
AND THEN YOU TRY
AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

37:45.930 --> 37:50.151
I'M TIRED OF
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.720
YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ?

37:52.730 --> 37:53.924
YOU'RE AFRAID OF HIM.

37:53.930 --> 37:55.227
FUCK YOU.

37:55.230 --> 37:58.620
AS MUCH AS I HATE YOU
TREATING ME LIKE A DOORMAT,

37:58.630 --> 38:00.848
IT'S EVEN WORSE SEEING
YOUR FATHER TREAT YOU LIKE ONE.

38:00.860 --> 38:03.795
YOU THINK I TREAT YOU
LIKE A DOORMAT ?

38:03.800 --> 38:05.051
SOMETIMES !

38:05.060 --> 38:08.097
WHY DON'T YOU
STAND UP TO HIM ?

38:09.660 --> 38:13.198
I DON'T THINK
I TREAT YOU LIKE A DOORMAT.

38:14.630 --> 38:17.428
SOMETIMES YOU DO.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.350
GO TO SLEEP !

38:23.830 --> 38:26.890
WE BOTH HAVE TO
GET UP EARLY.

38:40.030 --> 38:43.295
OKAY, YOU GUYS
NEED TO GO NOW.

38:45.860 --> 38:48.226
OKAY, THEN.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.821
UM...

38:54.830 --> 38:56.627
CAN I HAVE
YOUR NUMBER ?

38:56.630 --> 38:58.825
WHY, SO WE CAN DATE ?

39:03.460 --> 39:04.859
LATE.

39:12.830 --> 39:16.823
( door closing )

39:23.000 --> 39:27.027
( door opening )

39:30.100 --> 39:31.692
HEY, BABY.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.019
HEY.

39:33.030 --> 39:35.828
SO, HOW DID IT GO
WITH THE POLICE ?

39:35.830 --> 39:37.718
HOW DO YOU THINK
IT WENT ?

39:37.730 --> 39:39.220
THEY KEPT US THERE
ALL NIGHT.

39:39.230 --> 39:42.051
THEY DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO US
UNTIL ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

39:42.060 --> 39:44.199
AT LEAST
THEY DIDN'T ARREST YOU.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.952
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I COULD SHOVE A HOT DOG

39:45.960 --> 39:47.723
DOWN SOME
OLD LADY'S THROAT ?

39:47.730 --> 39:50.756
NO, OH, C'MON,
OF COURSE NOT,

39:50.760 --> 39:54.594
BUT YOU COULD'VE
NOTICED IT WAS THERE.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.428
YOU KNOW WHO
THEY THINK DID IT ?

39:59.430 --> 40:01.523
THE ROOM MATE,
RAMONA KIPPLEMAN.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.124
BUT THAT OLD BITCH
IS SMART,

40:04.130 --> 40:05.927
SHE'S NOT SAYING
ANYTHING TO THEM.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.818
SO, THAT'S THAT ?

40:07.830 --> 40:10.993
YEAH, EXCEPT NOW THANKS TO YOU,
I'M OUT OF A JOB.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.854
WHAT ?

40:12.860 --> 40:14.657
THEY FIRED DOLORES AND ME
FOR NEGLIGENCE.

40:14.660 --> 40:17.049
THEY HAD TO
HANG IT ON SOMEBODY.

40:18.100 --> 40:20.318
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO,

40:20.330 --> 40:23.026
HIDE A MURDER SO YOU KEEP
SOME SHITTY JOB ?

40:23.030 --> 40:24.918
OF COURSE NOT, RICO.

40:24.930 --> 40:26.955
BUT NOW
I HAVE TO GO OUT

40:26.960 --> 40:29.394
AND I HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER SHITTY JOB.

40:34.460 --> 40:37.224
YOU GOT JULIO
OFF TO SCHOOL ?

40:37.230 --> 40:39.926
YEAH.

40:39.930 --> 40:41.557
AND WHERE'S AUGUSTO ?

40:41.560 --> 40:44.495
HE'S TAKING A NAP.

40:48.760 --> 40:52.218
I'M GONNA TRY
AND GET SOME SLEEP
BEFORE HE WAKES UP.

41:02.730 --> 41:04.698
( bells ringing )

41:04.700 --> 41:06.759
WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND
PARKER ?

41:06.760 --> 41:09.991
OH, MY GOD,
THOSE ARE SO HIDEOUS.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.049
THEY'RE NOT HIDEOUS
IN THE LEAST.

41:13.060 --> 41:16.291
I LIKE THEM
AND DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY ?

41:16.300 --> 41:18.757
BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER
WHOM I LOVE VERY MUCH

41:18.760 --> 41:20.625
MADE THEM FOR ME.

41:20.630 --> 41:23.622
LOOK, THAT WASN'T ME,
IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

41:23.630 --> 41:26.326
I MAY JUST WEAR THESE PANTS
UNTIL THE DAY I DIE !

41:26.330 --> 41:28.298
PLEASE, DON'T.

41:28.300 --> 41:31.189
OH, GOD.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.293
WHAT MADE ME EVER THINK
I COULD BE AN ARTIST ?

41:33.300 --> 41:35.450
HERE, THIS IS
FOR YOU.

41:36.830 --> 41:38.559
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I BOTHER.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.051
I THINK YOU HAVE
REAL TALENT, CLAIRE.

41:41.060 --> 41:44.598
BUT GO AHEAD
AND TH ROW IT AWAY,

41:44.600 --> 41:46.295
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE SET ON DOING.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.422
TAYLOR, WOULD YOU
GO TO YOUR ROOM ?

42:04.430 --> 42:06.728
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

42:06.730 --> 42:09.221
YEAH, SURE.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.725
DAVID AND I
TALKED IT OVER,

42:15.730 --> 42:17.618
AND WE'VE DECIDED THAT
TAYLOR'S GONNA STAY WITH US

42:17.630 --> 42:18.892
FOR THE TIME BEING.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.390
AT LEAST UNTIL
THE SCHOOL YEAR'S UP.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.823
THE HELL YOU SAY.

42:22.830 --> 42:24.024
( Lucille )
KEITH--

42:24.030 --> 42:25.349
STAY OUT
OF THIS, MOM.

42:25.360 --> 42:29.228
THE CHILD
IS COMING HOME

42:29.230 --> 42:32.495
WITH ME
AND YOUR MOTHER !

42:32.500 --> 42:36.152
TAYLOR'S STAYING HERE
WITH ME AND DAVID
AND THAT'S FINAL.

42:36.160 --> 42:36.956
YOU--

42:36.960 --> 42:38.359
DO IT.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.453
I DARE YOU.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.691
( utensils clanking )

42:59.000 --> 43:01.298
( door slamming )

43:03.360 --> 43:05.419
I WAS HANDLING
SITUATION.

43:05.430 --> 43:07.898
YOU STUPID WOMAN !

43:07.900 --> 43:10.596
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO TALK TO ME THIS WAY !

43:10.600 --> 43:12.249
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT !

43:14.300 --> 43:15.824
CHRIST,
ALMIGHTY !

43:15.830 --> 43:18.390
( speaking Russian )

43:18.400 --> 43:20.049
( door slamming )

43:20.060 --> 43:21.948
ALRIGHT,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

43:21.960 --> 43:25.657
NIKOLAI OWED SOMEONE SOME MONEY
AND I PAID THEM BACK.

43:26.660 --> 43:28.298
WHAT ?

43:28.300 --> 43:30.325
YOU CAN'T BE TRYING TO FIX
OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS

43:30.330 --> 43:32.298
WITHOUT THEM ASKING,
CU PCAKE.

43:32.300 --> 43:35.554
YOU'RE TOO "CO-EY",
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.255
"CO-EY" ?

43:37.260 --> 43:38.557
CO-DEPENDENT.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.754
I KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.318
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
ROBBIE,

43:41.330 --> 43:42.820
I HATE THAT WORD.

43:42.830 --> 43:44.320
THAT WORD IS TOTALLY
INAPPROPRIATE HERE.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.025
I'M A MOTHER,
I HAVE A FAMILY.

43:46.030 --> 43:47.827
AND FAMILY MEMBERS
DEPEND ON ONE ANOTHER.

43:47.830 --> 43:50.128
YOU CAN'T BE INTIMATELY
INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE

43:50.130 --> 43:51.825
AND NOT BE
DEPENDENT ON THEM.

43:51.830 --> 43:56.119
I WASN'T AWARE THAT NIKOLAI
WAS A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.896
I FEEL SO BAD ABOUT
TREATING MY MOTHER

44:04.900 --> 44:06.492
LIKE SHIT
ALL THE TIME.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.320
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU TREAT HER LIKE SHIT ?

44:08.330 --> 44:11.049
I MADE HER THESE PANTS,

44:11.060 --> 44:14.052
THESE LIKE HARLEQUIN PANTS
WITH BELLS ON THEM.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.823
OH. MY GOD,
THEY'RE SO QUEER,

44:21.360 --> 44:22.827
SHE MEANS WELL.

44:22.830 --> 44:25.799
SHE'S JUST SO CLUELESS
AND, LIKE...

44:25.800 --> 44:28.451
I DON'T KNOW,
EMBARRASSING.

44:28.460 --> 44:31.054
EVERYONE'S EMBARRASSED
BY THEIR PARENTS.

44:32.830 --> 44:36.596
WHERE'S THE PICTURE OF YOU
AND WHAT'S-HER-NAME ?

44:36.600 --> 44:38.124
JENNY ?

44:38.130 --> 44:41.019
UH, WE BROKE UP.

44:41.030 --> 44:42.850
OH.

44:42.860 --> 44:45.420
YOU GUYS
LOOKED SO HAPPY.

44:45.430 --> 44:48.991
I MEAN, IN THE PHOTO,
SHE ALWAYS LOOKED REALLY HAPPY,

44:49.000 --> 44:52.754
I JUST ASSUMED
YOU WERE, LIKE...

44:52.760 --> 44:55.126
IN IT FOR KEEPS.

44:55.130 --> 44:57.519
YEAH, WELL,
WE WEREN'T.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.398
WHAT TIME IS IT ?

45:04.400 --> 45:07.028
AH, WE STILL HAVE
ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

45:07.030 --> 45:11.057
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT
YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ?

45:11.060 --> 45:12.652
NO.

45:12.660 --> 45:15.299
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT ME TO TALK ABOUT ?

45:15.300 --> 45:16.790
NO.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.722
NO, NOT REALLY.

45:18.730 --> 45:23.656
WELL, I'VE GOT
SOME PSYCH HOMEWORK
I COULD BE DOING.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.790
SO, SEE YA.

45:48.530 --> 45:51.090
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO MAKE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT ?

45:51.100 --> 45:53.091
NO, THANKS.

45:55.860 --> 45:58.693
HAVE YOU MADE ANY
DEFINITE PLANS
FOR THE WEDDING ?

46:00.400 --> 46:02.391
WELL, TO BE HONEST,
THERE MIGHT NOT BE A WEDDING.

46:02.400 --> 46:04.789
REALLY AND TRULY ?

46:05.800 --> 46:08.155
REALLY AND TRULY.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.718
WHAT DID SHE DO ?

46:09.730 --> 46:12.995
IT'S NOT SOMETHING BRENDA DID,
IT'S SOMETHING I DID.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.322
WELL, MAYBE
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

46:16.330 --> 46:18.821
OR MAYBE IT'S NOT
FOR THE BEST.

46:18.830 --> 46:19.922
MAYBE IT JUST IS.

46:19.930 --> 46:21.693
AND NOW I JUST
HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.

46:24.060 --> 46:27.188
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE ME

46:27.200 --> 46:29.020
TO MAKE YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT ?

46:31.200 --> 46:34.124
A GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICH ?

46:48.200 --> 46:50.589
( doorbell ringing )

47:02.600 --> 47:04.488
HEY.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.627
HEY.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.589
I TRIED
CALLING YOU.

47:21.700 --> 47:24.191
PEOPLE MAKE
MISTAKES, NATE.

47:24.200 --> 47:28.853
THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW
WHY THEY DO THE THINGS THEY DO.

47:31.530 --> 47:34.249
YOU DON'T LOVE THIS
LISA CHICK, DO YOU ?

47:34.260 --> 47:35.898
NO.

47:35.900 --> 47:37.151
GOOD.

47:38.500 --> 47:42.391
'CAUSE
I STILL LOVE YOU.

47:45.200 --> 47:48.954
AND I CAN'T LOSE YOU.

47:49.730 --> 47:51.994
I CAN'T.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.492
I NEED YOU, NATE.

48:01.530 --> 48:04.090
AS FUCKED UP
AS YOU ARE,

48:04.100 --> 48:07.752
YOU ARE THE SANEST THING
IN MY LIFE.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.729
LET'S WORK THIS OUT
TOGETHER, OKAY ?

48:10.730 --> 48:12.652
OKAY.

48:14.460 --> 48:16.792
I LOVE YOU.
