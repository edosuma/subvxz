WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.403
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:02.435 --> 00:03.971
Buffy, no.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.238
Dawnie, I have to.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.350
BUFFY'S VOICE:
 Be brave.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.088
Live. For me.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.257
We need the world
and the underworld

00:23.291 --> 00:25.092
to believe that
Buffy is alive and well.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.064
You're a machine!

00:30.097 --> 00:32.665
You telling me
 there's no Slayer
 in Sunnydale?

00:32.700 --> 00:35.668
It was like a trick.
 A robot.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.271
-I am programmed to go to you
when I'm injured.
-Good thinking.

00:38.305 --> 00:42.009
Town is wide open.
Nowhere like the Hellmouth
for a party.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.110
Let's ride!

00:45.813 --> 00:48.881
-"I've gone."
-GILES: I'm not one
 for good-byes,

00:48.915 --> 00:51.551
I thought it best
 to slip out quietly.
 Love to all, Giles.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.052
You're talking
about raising the dead.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.255
What if something
does go wrong?

00:54.287 --> 00:55.555
I'm telling you
it won't.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.758
We saw her body, Wil.
We buried it.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.726
But her soul.
Her essence.

00:59.759 --> 01:02.862
She could be trapped
in some sort
of hell dimension.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.563
I'm not going
to leave her there.

01:04.596 --> 01:07.734
Osiris, here lies
the warrior of the people.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.438
-Let her cross over.
-Oh, my god!

01:11.438 --> 01:14.575
- She needs help.
-TARA: Willow!

01:14.608 --> 01:16.075
Oh, my--

01:16.109 --> 01:18.245
-(groans)
-You're nothing but a toy.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.283
Get her!

01:24.852 --> 01:27.521
-Release her!
-Willow!
I need service.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.594
No!

01:46.174 --> 01:50.610
Oh, I'm dangerously close
from a systems failure.

01:52.111 --> 01:55.948
Must-- Oh!
Disengage from combat...

01:55.983 --> 01:58.752
so-- Oh!
...Willow can service me.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.289
I'll service you,
girl toy.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.466
Willow.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.503
I'm pretty sure
she's okay.

02:16.537 --> 02:20.274
Or as okay as anyone
who just had snakes
coming out of their mouth.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.109
What the hell was that
all about, Tara?

02:22.141 --> 02:25.945
Less talk, more running away.
I'm sure the woods'll
give us cover.

02:25.978 --> 02:28.216
Their motorcycles
can't follow us in here.

02:28.248 --> 02:31.485
(engines revving)
Someone should tell them that.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.853
New plan.

02:32.885 --> 02:35.456
Let's split up.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.824
No, bad plan.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.395
-I'll take her.
-No. I can carry her.

02:41.429 --> 02:44.198
I'll keep her safe,
Tara.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.567
We should
meet up somewhere.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.870
XANDER: The Magic Box.
And whoever gets there first,
call Dawn and Spike.

02:49.902 --> 02:52.906
What, um,
the Buffybot?

02:54.375 --> 02:56.810
-We can't. It's lost.
-(engines revving)

02:56.843 --> 02:58.679
Go!

03:01.748 --> 03:05.252
(shouting, grunting)

03:15.295 --> 03:17.129
(gasping)

03:28.207 --> 03:29.477
(theme music playing)

04:23.297 --> 04:26.033
(gasping)

04:38.711 --> 04:40.648
Xander.
Xander, where--

04:40.680 --> 04:43.584
-Shh. Shush.
-Where--

04:43.617 --> 04:45.485
We're using
our quiet voice, Wil.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.322
Wh-Wh-Where's Tara?

04:48.355 --> 04:51.358
Off and running,
like we need to be.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.293
-We gotta keep moving.
-Moving.

04:53.326 --> 04:56.963
Oh. Right.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.500
Demons on bikes.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.002
Yeah, we got trouble...

05:03.036 --> 05:05.137
right here
in Hellmouth City,

05:05.172 --> 05:07.107
and our very own Robo-Buffy
led them right to us.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.810
Buffy. The ritual.
We have to go back.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.545
Wil, I told you.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.115
No. We have
to try again.
We can't.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.518
We have to, Xander.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.687
She's-- She's waiting.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.988
She's counting on us,
on me.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.324
I can't leave her
there anymore.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.394
I won't.
We have to finish.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.995
-Shh.
-(engines revving)

05:33.332 --> 05:37.204
Wil, the Urn of Cirrhosis--

05:37.237 --> 05:39.973
-Osiris?
-Yeah.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.975
It got kind of...

05:42.009 --> 05:44.276
Broken.

05:45.745 --> 05:50.016
It's broken.
I remember.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.052
So we'll find
another one.

05:52.084 --> 05:55.689
Better made.
Anya and I will jump
back into the Web--

05:55.723 --> 05:57.725
There is no other one.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.894
Okay, then we'll fix
this one.

06:01.928 --> 06:05.865
A little tape,
a dab of Krazy Glue.
No.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.268
It's no use.

06:09.403 --> 06:13.105
The urn's defiled.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.041
It's gone.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.045
Nothing.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.148
It was all for nothing.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.653
Buffy's gone.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.057
She's really gone.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.000
(grunting)

06:58.951 --> 07:00.187
(tires screeching)

07:03.255 --> 07:05.024
-(items shattering)
-(shouting)

07:09.129 --> 07:11.831
What's going on?

07:11.865 --> 07:14.668
Stay away from the window.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.637
What is it?
What's happening?

07:16.670 --> 07:19.773
Just do as I say.
I'm gonna check
the rest of the house.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.173
Don't move!

07:21.207 --> 07:22.509
-(items shattering)
-(shouting)

07:28.314 --> 07:30.817
DEMON:
Over here!
Stop your moaning.

07:33.019 --> 07:36.355
Was that really necessary?
I mean, a simple "psst"--

07:41.694 --> 07:45.197
-I'm just sayin' it's rank.
-Get off it, Klyed.

07:45.231 --> 07:48.968
Razor and the others head back
to town, leave us here
to hunt down strays.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.838
Hey, you got a bug
up your crack,

07:51.872 --> 07:54.106
you take it up
with Razor.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.375
Until then,
you do as he says

07:56.408 --> 07:58.612
and shut your hole

07:58.646 --> 08:00.814
before I rip you
a new one.

08:08.721 --> 08:12.158
Ah, screw this.
Let's get out of here.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.060
Let's go hit some stores.

08:15.663 --> 08:19.800
Doesn't sound like they
found Willow and Xander.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.702
Did he say stores?
Hitting stores?

08:22.735 --> 08:25.072
Does that mean looting?

08:25.105 --> 08:28.675
I think--
I think the woods
let out over this way.

08:28.709 --> 08:33.547
We should
keep off the streets,
take alleys if we can.

08:33.581 --> 08:37.585
They can't loot
the Magic Shop.
Not now. I just got it.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.820
Let's go.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.556
You don't think they'll cause
a lot of damage, do you?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.609
A couple of stakes.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.778
Some holy water.
One cross. Ow!

09:04.812 --> 09:07.780
Brilliant.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.618
Here. You want me
to bloody thump you?

09:10.650 --> 09:13.552
I told you to stay away
from the window.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.789
Who are they?
Hellions.
Road pirates.

09:16.823 --> 09:20.527
They raid towns,
use 'em up, burn 'em down.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.163
It's usually backwaters.
Anyplace--

09:24.898 --> 09:26.799
Anyplace they think
is vulnerable.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.403
They know...
the Slayer's gone.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.309
We can't stay here.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.480
Well, I'm not going out there.
Got no choice, bit.
Can't protect you here.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.816
We can lock the doors,
turn out the lights.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.418
And what, hide
under the bed linens?
Not really my style.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.086
But we need to wait
for the others and Buffy.

09:48.989 --> 09:52.091
Bot.
You know, the Buffybot.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.793
-(glass breaks)
-(engines revving)

09:53.826 --> 09:55.595
(sighs)
We have to wait
to see if the others--

09:55.629 --> 09:57.798
Look.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.903
Dawn, I get
that you're scared.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.172
But I'm your sitter,
so mind me.

10:07.173 --> 10:11.344
I'm not gonna let any of
those buggers lay so much
as a warty digit on you.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.312
Right?

10:14.847 --> 10:16.984
-Right.
-Right, then.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.586
We can't wait around
to see if the others
will pop in.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.657
We're on our own.
No one's coming
to our rescue.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.832
(gasping)

11:54.447 --> 11:55.915
(glass shatters)

12:01.321 --> 12:02.923
Willow, Xander!

12:07.394 --> 12:09.763
They're not here.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.298
Oh, thank God.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.433
No. I mean my store
hasn't been looted.

12:14.466 --> 12:17.736
-(glass shattering)
-Yet.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.649
-Xander.
-They're all right.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.485
Where are they?
Why aren't they here?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.721
-I don't know.
-They could be hurt.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.590
Xander could be lying somewhere,
broken and bleeding,
calling out my name.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.226
-Anya.
-Like that. Oh, God.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.663
I mean, what if--
what if they're really hurt?
What if they're dead already?

12:43.696 --> 12:46.499
-They're not.
-How do you know?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.567
Because he's with Willow.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.503
And if something happened,

12:50.537 --> 12:52.772
I'd know.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.307
And so would you.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.312
-You think?
-I'm sure of it.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.985
They're fine.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.989
They're both fine.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.691
Maybe they got lost
in the woods.

13:11.724 --> 13:15.195
The woods?
Are we going back
to the woods?

13:15.227 --> 13:17.965
I hate the woods.
All those woodsy trees.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.100
No, it's okay.
Lost is good.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.970
Willow and I always know
how to find each other.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.177
With yoga?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.278
Shh.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.182
Aradia, hear my words.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.688
XANDER:
Okay, this is really starting
to grate my cheese.

13:42.721 --> 13:46.225
These woods aren't that big.
Now, I know we've been
going straight

13:46.259 --> 13:49.897
because I've been following
the North Star.

13:49.929 --> 13:53.365
Xander, that's not
the North Star.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.501
It's an airplane.

13:55.534 --> 13:59.371
Nah, it's not an airplane.
That's definitely...

13:59.405 --> 14:01.573
a blimp.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.110
But I can see
how one would make
that airplane mistake.

14:05.711 --> 14:09.149
I-I can't walk anymore.
I need to rest.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.549
It can't be much further.

14:10.582 --> 14:12.818
You said that an hour ago.

14:12.851 --> 14:16.322
I just-- That spell
took a lot out of me.

14:16.355 --> 14:20.994
As, for example, snakes?

14:21.028 --> 14:22.761
How come you didn't
tell us how much--

14:22.794 --> 14:25.398
No. Not now.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.903
What were we into
back there, Wil?
Doesn't matter anyway.

14:32.404 --> 14:35.174
Do not get all
avoidy on me.
I'm not avoidy.

14:35.207 --> 14:38.778
I just--
We have bigger problems--
demons.

14:38.811 --> 14:42.581
Demons. Ah, well,
there's something
you don't see every day.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.717
(chuckles)
Unless you're us.

14:45.751 --> 14:49.721
Yeah, and now we're lost,
so can we-- What's that?

14:49.755 --> 14:52.292
See? Avoidy.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.062
Over there.
That-That light.

14:55.095 --> 14:59.631
That one
moving towards us...
incredibly fast?

14:59.665 --> 15:02.769
Hello?
"Hello"?
We're being hunted,

15:02.802 --> 15:05.437
and you're hello-ing
a strange, fast-moving
light in the dark?

15:05.471 --> 15:06.639
It could be anything.

15:08.107 --> 15:10.376
It's a motorcycle
headlight.
No.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.544
Yeah.
Too small.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.581
-Stay behind me.
-Xander, I don't--

15:14.614 --> 15:16.416
Just stay down.
I'll take care of this.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.086
Xander, it's--

15:20.120 --> 15:22.154
A bug.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.557
A big,
fiery bug thing.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.326
-Xander.
-Get off.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.797
Do fireflies bite?
No, they probably burn,
don't they?

15:30.830 --> 15:35.067
They get--
(grunts)
Xander, it's not a bug.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.336
It's Tara.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.306
Come on.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.778
And how long have you known
that your girlfriend's
Tinker Bell?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.682
(siren wailing)

16:01.193 --> 16:03.230
(alarm sounding)

16:07.399 --> 16:09.068
MAN:
What are you doing?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.605
Get away from there.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.174
You hear me?

16:15.207 --> 16:17.210
I said
get off my property!

16:18.977 --> 16:21.648
-Leave us alone.
Get out of here!
-(gunshot)

16:27.019 --> 16:29.155
Get back.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.259
(shouting)

16:41.400 --> 16:44.703
-(woman screaming)
-Hey.

16:44.736 --> 16:48.240
It looks like
they're just wrecking stuff,

16:48.274 --> 16:50.376
with no thought other than
just destruct-o-rama.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.649
What?

16:56.682 --> 17:00.287
Uh-- Oh, nothing.
Just, uh, looked like fun.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.423
I'm just saying.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.057
Yeah.

17:05.092 --> 17:08.861
It's just with this kind
of frolicking going on
all around town,

17:08.894 --> 17:10.762
we're not gonna
get very far without--

17:42.628 --> 17:44.163
Let's fly, pigeon!

17:52.404 --> 17:54.473
(pounding on door)

17:54.507 --> 17:57.042
Already been looted.
Sorry. Um...

17:57.076 --> 18:00.078
Try the appliance store
down the block.
They've got great toasters.

18:00.113 --> 18:03.115
-(knocking)
-XANDER:
Anya.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.084
Xander?

18:09.155 --> 18:11.624
I knew
you weren't dead.

18:11.657 --> 18:14.059
Well, then,
why was I so worried?
Are you--

18:14.093 --> 18:17.529
Not yet, but--
but I will be.

18:19.965 --> 18:22.469
Where's Dawn and Spike?
We've been calling
the house, but--

18:22.501 --> 18:26.338
Maybe they're on their way here.
I mean, this place is NORAD
when we're at DEFCON 1.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.077
Okay, I so need
male friends.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.113
We have to go out
and look for them.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.082
There's this guy at work
I kind of hit it off with.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.518
Tito. I mean,
he seems like a good--

18:42.020 --> 18:44.923
You were talking about
Dawn and Spike, of course.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.959
ANYA:
Um, question.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.494
You want us
to go back out there?

18:48.528 --> 18:49.929
WILLOW:
Well, yeah.

18:49.961 --> 18:53.365
Unless somebody's got
a better idea.

18:53.400 --> 18:59.705
Well, um, it's just
we're minus a Buffybot,

18:59.739 --> 19:02.541
and Spike is missing in action
somewhere with Dawn,

19:02.575 --> 19:05.444
and Giles flew away,
and, um--

19:05.478 --> 19:08.315
Well, you--
you're looking a little
magicked out.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.982
An, honey, we're nearing
your point, right?

19:11.017 --> 19:12.852
It's just how are we supposed
to fight these guys?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.288
I mean,

19:15.321 --> 19:17.390
you know, we can take
a vampire or two, sure,

19:17.423 --> 19:20.893
but there's a whole cavalcade
of demons out there, and, uh--

19:20.926 --> 19:22.295
I mean, I think this, you know,

19:22.328 --> 19:24.096
it takes, um--

19:25.096 --> 19:27.299
I mean, we need--

19:27.334 --> 19:29.035
Buffy.
(softly)
Buffy.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.169
Buffy...

19:32.939 --> 19:35.173
is not coming back.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.876
We failed.

19:42.848 --> 19:47.420
So, we're it, gang.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.824
Xander, grab the weapons.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.059
We're gonna look
for Dawn and Spike.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.494
(glass shattering)

19:55.528 --> 19:57.163
If we're gonna go,
we should go now.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.730
They're just getting
more and more worked up
by the minute.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.032
Well, they can't
keep it up forever.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.001
I mean, maybe they'll
party themselves out,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.003
you know,
tire of this place
and move on.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.038
Say hello to
your new home, boys.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.442
(cheering, shouting)

20:15.047 --> 20:18.116
This here is
a momentous occasion,
the beginning of a new era.

20:27.960 --> 20:33.031
Now, no question,
the open back roads and highways
have been good to us,

20:33.065 --> 20:37.403
but we got ourselves
a juicy little burg here
just ripe for the picking.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.905
And I ain't in no hurry
to leave it. Are you?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.641
(Demons shouting
in agreement)

20:44.611 --> 20:47.880
So I figure, what better way
to kick off

20:47.913 --> 20:52.285
our semi-settling down
than with a little christening?

20:52.318 --> 20:54.820
(cheering)

21:00.960 --> 21:06.298
A symbolic act commemorating
the new order around here

21:06.333 --> 21:10.169
and ridding ourselves of any
not-so-pleasant reminders

21:10.201 --> 21:12.003
of the old...

21:13.839 --> 21:17.309
all in one quick,

21:17.344 --> 21:21.448
really, really violent
fell swoop.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.583
(Demons cheer)

21:23.615 --> 21:26.986
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.368
Bye-bye, Slayer.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.403
(no dialogue)

21:44.903 --> 21:46.305
No!

21:53.078 --> 21:55.847
Another one
for the fire, boys.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.884
Tear it up.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.230
(yelling)

22:17.068 --> 22:19.171
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.914
It wasn't your fault.
We don't know if
the spell would've worked,

22:28.948 --> 22:31.317
-even if the demons--
-It would've worked.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.420
Well, maybe--

22:34.854 --> 22:36.522
What?

22:36.556 --> 22:38.857
Maybe it wasn't
supposed to.

22:38.891 --> 22:42.929
I mean,
those demons showing up
at the exact wrong time?

22:42.961 --> 22:45.932
Maybe we really were
in over our heads,

22:45.964 --> 22:49.501
invoking forces that
we have no right to.

22:49.536 --> 22:53.705
Maybe the fates sent down
all that destruction
on us to stop us.

22:53.740 --> 22:57.209
I mean--
You mean,
maybe it was my fault.

22:57.242 --> 23:00.946
No. No.

23:08.954 --> 23:12.892
I'm not saying
we announce it this second.
Anya.

23:12.924 --> 23:15.461
I think it would please them
to know we're engaged.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.195
And I think Willow
in particular

23:17.229 --> 23:19.265
could use a real
morale booster right now.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.900
Can we talk
about this later?

23:20.932 --> 23:22.934
Well, but it's just all
the excuses

23:22.969 --> 23:25.203
for not telling everyone
we're engaged are gone now.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.874
I mean, aside from hell bikers,
there's nothing standing
in our way.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.176
This is it, you know.
No more surprises.
Watch it.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.585
It's-It's the Buffybot.

23:38.617 --> 23:42.721
Ah, peachy. No doubt
to lead the wild bunch
right to us again.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.923
Hey, Wil, next time
this thing's damaged,

23:44.957 --> 23:47.493
couldn't you program it
to find the nearest
Radio Shack or--

23:50.762 --> 23:52.097
Buffy?

23:54.299 --> 23:56.067
-WILLOW: Buffy!
-XANDER: Buffy!

23:56.102 --> 23:57.769
WILLOW:
Buffy!

23:57.804 --> 24:00.205
-ANYA: Where is she?
-WILLOW: Here.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.615
Buffy?

24:08.647 --> 24:10.348
WILLOW:
Buffy, are you--

24:15.020 --> 24:16.689
It's Willow.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.557
Can you hear me?

24:21.528 --> 24:25.531
-What's wrong with her?
-Nothing. She--

24:25.565 --> 24:28.299
WILLOW:
She's-She's in shock.

24:28.334 --> 24:30.301
Her hands are bleeding.

24:30.336 --> 24:31.703
TARA: Her fingers.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.005
ANYA: She's filthy.

24:34.205 --> 24:35.508
Oh, no.

24:35.541 --> 24:38.845
WILLOW:
What?
No.

24:38.877 --> 24:41.180
How could we--
So stupid!

24:41.212 --> 24:42.781
Xander!

24:42.815 --> 24:45.617
XANDER:
Our spell.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.721
Our resurrection spell
worked like a magic charm.

24:48.755 --> 24:53.224
We brought you
back to life, Buffy.
Right where we left her.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.729
Oh, god.

24:58.329 --> 25:00.098
In her coffin.

25:02.034 --> 25:06.038
She had to...
dig out of her own grave.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.011
(muffled)
Buffy?

25:14.212 --> 25:16.248
Buffy, it's Xander.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.689
We're sorry.
We didn't know.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.392
XANDER: Buffy.
TARA: You aren't reaching her.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.227
She's too traumatized.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.867
Hey, Buffy.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.704
Here's some good news
that might perk you right up.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.740
-Xander and I
have an announcement.
-Anya!

25:40.772 --> 25:43.976
What? I--
I'm just trying to help.

25:46.778 --> 25:51.584
Buffy, it's gonna be
all right.

25:53.752 --> 25:57.155
XANDER:
We brought you back.
You're home now.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.730
Yeah, that's it.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.566
You're home.
DEMON: Yeah.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.701
Welcome home, Slayer.

26:09.736 --> 26:13.439
Alive and kicking after all.

26:14.740 --> 26:18.443
Well, alive, anyway.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.614
Not looking too good,
though, is she?

26:21.647 --> 26:24.316
XANDER:
I don't see you winning
too many beauty contests,

26:24.349 --> 26:27.153
unless
the Miss "My Face Fell Off"
Pageant gets going.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.056
Big ax you got there.

26:30.088 --> 26:33.291
The better to cut you
down to size, Grandma.

26:37.496 --> 26:38.765
(speaking
foreign language)

26:43.368 --> 26:47.472
-So you got a witch in the mix.
-More than one.

26:47.506 --> 26:50.175
I happen to be a very
powerful man-witch myself.

26:51.644 --> 26:55.280
Or male--
Is it a warlock?

26:56.883 --> 26:58.984
Warlock.

26:59.018 --> 27:02.087
Plus, we have
a Slayer here, um,

27:02.121 --> 27:04.123
who might actually be looking
to eat some brains,

27:04.155 --> 27:06.192
so I think a little
quiet moseying,

27:06.224 --> 27:08.294
no hard feelings,
and I'm sure...

27:08.326 --> 27:10.561
your demon horde
won't think
any the less of you.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.531
Now, my boys--
See, that's tricky.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.667
They came looking
for a massacre,

27:15.701 --> 27:20.707
and I think you got exactly
enough magic between you

27:20.740 --> 27:23.642
for a kiddie
birthday party.

27:25.076 --> 27:26.612
Then you'd be wrong.

27:26.644 --> 27:30.215
Whoa. Well, I better back off,
or you might, what,

27:30.249 --> 27:32.351
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

27:32.384 --> 27:34.820
Don't do that.
Why would she do that?
WILLOW: Look.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.222
We don't want trouble.
You don't want trouble.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.526
Of course we want trouble.
We're demons.

27:40.558 --> 27:43.229
We're really
all about trouble.

27:43.261 --> 27:45.230
Not this kind.

27:45.263 --> 27:49.234
Oh. I get your point.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.882
Now let me tell you
something, children.
We're not gonna fight you.

28:02.914 --> 28:06.786
We're just gonna hold you down
and enjoy ourselves
for a few hours.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.556
You might
even live through it,

28:10.588 --> 28:12.759
except that
certain of my boys

28:12.791 --> 28:16.729
got some anatomical
incompatibilities

28:16.762 --> 28:22.101
that tend to tear up
little girls. Yeah.

28:22.134 --> 28:25.436
So, who wants to go first?

28:30.241 --> 28:33.578
I was really hoping
it'd be you.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.310
Does this mean we win?

29:56.962 --> 29:59.798
There. What's that?

30:24.089 --> 30:25.857
It's just a machine,
Dawn.

30:27.692 --> 30:29.595
I know.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.144
(gasps)

30:45.176 --> 30:47.179
Dawn.

30:47.212 --> 30:50.348
You're my sister Dawn.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.089
Where did I go?

30:58.124 --> 31:00.558
What?

31:00.592 --> 31:03.561
Where did I go?

31:03.595 --> 31:07.165
I was here. Here.

31:07.199 --> 31:10.135
But then I ran away.

31:12.871 --> 31:17.143
-I-I don't--
-No, not me.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.946
The other Buffy.

31:20.980 --> 31:24.715
Yes. The other Buffy.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.652
Buffy?

31:28.253 --> 31:31.423
I don't--
I don't...

31:31.457 --> 31:34.625
know where she ran off to.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.096
Maybe--

31:55.480 --> 31:58.884
Look what those
filthy buggers done to you.

31:58.916 --> 32:02.087
Willow's slap and paste job's
not gonna do the trick
this time.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.289
Robot's done.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.992
Hey.
Little bit?

32:08.359 --> 32:10.195
Dawn!

32:11.497 --> 32:13.298
SPIKE:
Dawn!

32:36.654 --> 32:38.890
Well, they wanted a massacre.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.128
She's Buffy.
She's herself again.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.896
You're back, Buffy.
You really are.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.669
Whoa. Whoa.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.390
WILLOW:
Buffy!

33:11.423 --> 33:14.625
-Where's she going?
-Should we follow her?

33:14.660 --> 33:16.728
I don't know.

33:16.761 --> 33:20.398
She just...
needs some time is all.

33:20.432 --> 33:24.001
The important thing
is that she's back.
She'll be fine.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.714
Xander, look out!

33:36.748 --> 33:38.849
Now, what kind
of Slayer is it...

33:38.884 --> 33:41.619
runs out on her buddies
just when they
need her the most?

34:17.456 --> 34:20.358
(speaking foreign language)

34:20.391 --> 34:22.293
(yelling)

35:09.974 --> 35:11.543
(speaking foreign language)

35:21.152 --> 35:23.621
-(gasping)
-So, witch,

35:23.655 --> 35:25.824
got a little power
after all.

35:25.856 --> 35:28.293
Well, let's see
what tricks
you can manage...

35:28.327 --> 35:29.827
while I choke
the life outta y--

35:29.860 --> 35:31.396
-(axe thuds)
-(groans)

35:37.869 --> 35:39.938
Tara.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.039
Nobody messes
with my girl.

35:43.309 --> 35:46.077
-Tara, nice axing.
-My first.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.880
Buffy.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.510
Dawn's voice:
Buffy, no.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.813
Dawnie, I have to.
DAWN: Buffy?

37:05.291 --> 37:06.891
Buffy.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.231
Buffy.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.235
How--

37:23.675 --> 37:25.510
Is it you?

37:27.445 --> 37:29.815
I mean, really?

37:32.918 --> 37:35.085
-What are you--
-(metal creaking)

37:41.460 --> 37:42.527
No!

37:46.664 --> 37:47.833
Don't!

37:49.835 --> 37:52.670
Don't jump, Buffy.
Don't move!

37:54.373 --> 37:56.641
Just walk to me.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.610
Please!

38:03.614 --> 38:05.516
Please?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.860
I'm your sister...

38:14.893 --> 38:17.161
Dawn.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.364
We were up here
together,

38:19.398 --> 38:23.201
and then...
you went away.

38:23.233 --> 38:25.637
And you don't want
to do that again.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.376
I don't know
how you're back,

38:30.409 --> 38:33.612
but you are,
and, please,

38:33.644 --> 38:36.114
just stay still.

38:36.146 --> 38:39.217
(screams)
Or-Or move,

38:39.250 --> 38:41.152
but-but towards me,

38:41.186 --> 38:43.789
because the tower
was built by crazy people,
and I don't think

38:43.822 --> 38:45.657
it's holding up
very well.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.096
Talk to me.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.099
Say something!

38:57.735 --> 39:00.639
Is this hell?

39:00.672 --> 39:03.173
What?

39:07.778 --> 39:10.581
Is this hell?

39:13.184 --> 39:17.255
No!
Buffy, no!

39:19.090 --> 39:21.927
You're here...
with me.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.996
Whatever happened
to you,

39:26.030 --> 39:27.932
whatever you've
been through, it's--

39:27.965 --> 39:30.235
it's over now.

39:30.268 --> 39:32.637
You're--
(screams)

39:34.440 --> 39:36.942
We have to get off
of this tower!

39:43.648 --> 39:47.284
It was so clear...

39:47.318 --> 39:49.253
on this spot.

39:51.088 --> 39:54.425
I remember how...

39:54.460 --> 39:56.728
shiny...

39:56.762 --> 39:58.963
and clear everything was.

40:01.467 --> 40:04.469
But... now--

40:04.503 --> 40:07.105
now--

40:07.137 --> 40:10.375
Buffy...

40:10.407 --> 40:13.177
please listen to me.

40:15.313 --> 40:18.382
You told me
I had to be strong.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.351
And I've tried.

40:22.688 --> 40:25.490
But it's been
so hard without you.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.994
I'm sorry.

40:31.195 --> 40:34.164
I promise I'll do better.
I will...

40:37.135 --> 40:39.137
if you're with me.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.342
Stay with me...

40:44.375 --> 40:47.112
please!

40:47.144 --> 40:49.047
I need you to live.

40:51.349 --> 40:54.119
Live for--

40:55.152 --> 40:56.487
(screams)

40:59.289 --> 41:01.025
Buffy!

41:01.059 --> 41:02.860
Dawn.

41:02.893 --> 41:04.862
Buffy!

41:04.896 --> 41:06.297
Dawn!

41:21.547 --> 41:23.581
(screaming)

41:34.492 --> 41:36.226
(screaming continues)

42:04.590 --> 42:06.423
Buffy?

42:14.766 --> 42:17.568
Buffy. You're--

42:18.869 --> 42:21.206
You're--

42:21.239 --> 42:23.108
You're really here.

42:26.110 --> 42:28.213
You're alive,

42:28.246 --> 42:30.148
and you're home.

42:32.449 --> 42:34.485
You're home.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.461
Grr! Arrgh!
