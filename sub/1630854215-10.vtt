00:00.568 --> 00:01.602
<i>Previously on
"The Good Doctor"...</i>

00:02.970 --> 00:05.573
Glassman found movement
in my psoas and glutes.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.775
He and Murphy found
an endoscopic solution.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.810
- How about I make you dinner?
- Sounds good.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.045
It's a date then.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.380
A date.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.582
Audrey...
Will you marry me?

00:16.550 --> 00:19.587
Shaun.
I'm pregnant.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.057
My OB told us it isn't safe
for me-- or the baby.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.558
Danny!

00:24.692 --> 00:26.060
No, no, no. Danny.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.462
Danny.

00:34.768 --> 00:38.239
<i>♪ Let the sun burn my eyes ♪</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:41.142
<i>♪ Awake, my heart
is open wide to you ♪</i>

00:41.275 --> 00:43.077
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.278
I'll get the coffee.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.814
This is my third stay
in a week.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.916
I no longer require
guest-level service.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.451
I want the practice.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.624
Two cups, no cane,

00:56.757 --> 00:59.460
no guarantee
how long it'll take.

00:59.593 --> 01:03.197
Well, when it comes to you,
my patience is boundless.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.832
One of the many things
I adore about you.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.602
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

01:08.736 --> 01:11.305
<i>♪ Inside my mind, oh ♪</i>

01:11.439 --> 01:12.706
It's been three months.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.842
The man's a saint.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.180
I have been recovering
from a major surgery

01:19.313 --> 01:20.948
and re-learning to walk.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.750
Your recovery's
remarkable.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.518
So is
your procrastination.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.287
I am taking the time
to consider

01:26.420 --> 01:27.821
the biggest decision
of my life.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.190
Clay's fine.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.991
No man--
no <i>person--</i>

01:31.125 --> 01:33.627
is fine waiting this long
for an answer to that question.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.599
Ever done one
of whatever this is before?

01:38.732 --> 01:40.033
No. You?

01:40.168 --> 01:41.769
Mm-mm.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.438
I've been clean
for 92 days.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.106
I went to rehab
for two months,

01:46.240 --> 01:48.642
and I go to meetings
every single day.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.178
I don't know if you two
can ever trust me again,

01:50.311 --> 01:52.480
but I am willing to do
whatever it takes

01:52.613 --> 01:53.781
to earn back
my place here.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.887
And we'll do everything
we can to support you
in your recovery.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.423
But our number-one obligation
is to our patients.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.592
For their safety
and yours,

02:04.725 --> 02:06.260
we need to put
some guardrails in place.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.531
You'll be on probation
for six months.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.366
You cannot prescribe
or administer

02:12.500 --> 02:14.001
any controlled substances.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.703
You will be given
random drug tests,

02:15.836 --> 02:17.838
and every step
of your patient care

02:17.971 --> 02:20.541
will be supervised by the
Senior Resident on your case.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.909
Today that is Dr. Allen.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.213
You okay with those terms,
Dr. Perez?

02:28.081 --> 02:29.417
Absolutely.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.253
I'm just happy
to be here.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.687
How are you?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.190
Better.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.025
A lot better.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.396
I hadn't
heard from you.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.898
Which is
totally understandable.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.667
I just wasn't sure...

02:46.800 --> 02:48.202
I didn't know
what to say.

02:51.705 --> 02:55.743
You're not the reason that--
that happened.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.350
As your supervisor
on the case,

03:02.483 --> 03:07.054
I will oversee your charting,
your patient interactions,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.723
double-check
your med orders.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.560
And this.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.471
Fetal movement is good.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.539
Heart rate
is normal at 150.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.140
I've been monitoring
the heart rate daily.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.578
It ranges from
146 to 163 BPM.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.613
Her last emesis
was three weeks ago.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.947
So the nausea's
getting better.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.783
- Great.
- And the fatigue.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.752
Less improvement on
the constant state of terror.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.788
You made it through
the first trimester.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.123
- You're doing great.
- Mm.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.157
You two want to know
the sex of the baby?

03:44.292 --> 03:46.294
- Yes.
- No. Don't look.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.596
It'll be
a fun surprise.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.498
Oh.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.600
It is fun
to be prepared.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.472
Oh.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.443
What's going on?

04:03.777 --> 04:06.113
There is a small, thinning area

04:06.246 --> 04:07.315
on your uterine wall.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.117
It is slightly hypoechoic,

04:10.250 --> 04:13.321
likely a result of the scar
tissue from your prior surgery

04:13.454 --> 04:15.022
and Asherman's syndrome.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.357
Is that bad?
It sounds bad.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.825
Mm.

04:19.092 --> 04:23.397
If it progresses,
your uterus could rupture

04:23.531 --> 04:25.866
and we would
lose the baby.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.272
But it's very possible
the lining will remain stable

04:32.406 --> 04:34.408
and your pregnancy
will progress normally.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.647
What happens now?

04:41.615 --> 04:44.652
We'll put you
on bed rest
and monitor you closely.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.660
You're wrong.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.662
There may be a surgery
that can fix this.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.667
I need to talk to Dr. Lim
and Dr. Glassman.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.386
Hello. I have admitted Lea
for close monitoring

05:18.519 --> 05:20.220
and a follow-up MRI,

05:20.354 --> 05:22.189
which detected a small amount
of free fluid in the abdomen.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.057
This, plus a slight decline
in the hematocrit,

05:24.191 --> 05:27.395
increases the likelihood
of rupture by 3% to 5%.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.630
Shaun, I'm so sorry.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.032
How are you and Lea
holding up?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.467
Oh. Fine.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.703
I found a surgery
to fix it.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.137
I have spent
the last three months

05:37.270 --> 05:39.106
researching every complication
of Asherman's syndrome.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.208
I discovered
an experimental procedure

05:41.341 --> 05:43.711
to reinforce the uterine lining
with collagen fleece

05:43.844 --> 05:46.113
that will expand
as the uterus grows.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.681
I have studied
the technique,

05:47.815 --> 05:49.983
and I will teach you
how to do it.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.919
How many times has
this procedure been done?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.921
Five.
Three had good outcomes

05:54.054 --> 05:55.689
and the babies were carried
to full term,

05:55.823 --> 05:56.924
and the odds
are better for Lea

05:57.057 --> 05:58.859
because you are
above-average surgeons.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.093
Shaun,
I don't need to remind you,

06:00.227 --> 06:02.563
but this procedure
can induce labor

06:02.696 --> 06:04.297
and can cause
major bleeding.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.733
You could lose the baby.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.336
If we wait
and the uterus ruptures,

06:09.470 --> 06:13.106
we will definitely
lose the baby

06:13.240 --> 06:16.009
and Lea could suffer
a catastrophic hemorrhage.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.811
Due to the size
of the uterine window,

06:17.945 --> 06:19.580
there's a good chance
it won't.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.583
No, with Lea's prior surgery
and the significant
scar tissue,

06:22.716 --> 06:25.118
I put the likelihood of rupture
at close to 65%.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.754
Those chances...

06:28.288 --> 06:29.122
not good.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.762
Lea's body, her call.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.631
Drew Dewitt.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.333
Has recurrent desmoid tumors
caused by Gardner's syndrome.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.669
The one on his liver
is benign,

06:41.802 --> 06:43.537
but it hasn't
responded to chemo.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.173
It's encroaching on the stomach
and spleen.
It has to come out.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.041
Thus,
the surgical consult.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.146
He has almost no
small intestine.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.048
He needed a major resection
a year ago.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.485
He's been living off
IV nutrition ever since.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.952
I've treated him
for post-op infections

06:59.086 --> 07:01.088
and pain management
over the last year.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.790
I've never seen this much
scar tissue in a patient.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.692
How many surgeries
has he had?

07:04.825 --> 07:08.829
20. Plus 16 rounds chemo
and 34 hospital stays.

07:08.962 --> 07:12.199
Unfortunately, we have to add
one more surgery to that list.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.968
Will this surgery affect his
place on the transplant list?

07:15.102 --> 07:17.337
We've been waiting over a year
for a small bowel.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.474
Apparently, I'm "too healthy"
to move to the top.

07:20.608 --> 07:24.011
It shouldn't, barring
long-term infection
or other organ damage.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.813
When you're ready,
we can take you to pre-op.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.823
- You got this, D.
- You know it.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.738
I have no idea.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.573
Would you like us to go over

07:52.706 --> 07:54.341
the risks
and benefits again?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.809
No, I know everything
that could go wrong.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.611
All I can see
is what can go wrong.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.146
You don't have to decide
right now.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.881
We can continue
to monitor.

08:01.014 --> 08:04.017
If we wait, the uterine window
could expand

08:04.151 --> 08:05.586
and make the surgery
more risky.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.621
Now is the safest time.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.356
Don't pressure her, Shaun.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.698
Okay. Okay,
I know I trust you.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.568
So if you think surgery
is the right decision,
then we should do it.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.270
On one condition.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.540
I want you in the OR.

08:28.208 --> 08:32.412
Not for me, but if something
were to go wrong

08:32.546 --> 08:35.949
and we lose our baby,

08:36.083 --> 08:37.885
I need you
to be with her.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.588
Or him.

08:44.858 --> 08:49.396
With my guidance, I think
there is a very good chance

08:49.529 --> 08:50.898
our baby will be fine.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.603
Mm.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.774
Forceps and Metz.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.914
How's it feel to be
in the OR again?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.416
Very good, sir.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.252
We're all very glad
to have you back.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.922
We've exposed the surface
of the liver.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.925
Tumor's invaded the liver
capsule and parenchyma.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.795
That's twice the size
it appeared on imaging.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.664
If we take out
all of the tumor,

09:23.797 --> 09:24.832
he'll only have
half a liver left.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.334
We don't have a choice.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.184
Make sure
to approximate the edges

09:45.218 --> 09:47.287
so it overlaps
with the uterine window.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.957
I internalized that the first
three times you told me, Shaun.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.493
I'm sorry you and Lea
are going through this.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.128
Mm.
Dr. Lim was able

09:55.262 --> 09:57.765
to place the fleece patch
seven seconds faster.

09:57.898 --> 10:01.334
But your laparoscopic
suturing technique is superior.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.703
You will be
in charge of that.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.472
Practice it now. Please.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.874
Shaun, I've done it
a million times.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.142
You have never done them
on my wife.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.846
Fair point.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.019
Because we had to
take more of your liver

10:19.152 --> 10:21.188
than we'd hoped, your
liver function is declining.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.560
Getting your nutrition through
an IV is tough on your body.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.998
The TPN that's keeping me
alive's also killing me?

10:32.700 --> 10:34.034
That's gnarly.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.203
So, what's the alternative
to TPN?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.404
How do we
get him nutrients?

10:37.537 --> 10:39.139
We're looking into it.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.708
For now, we're gonna
manage your symptoms

10:40.841 --> 10:43.777
and keep you stable until
a small bowel
becomes available.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.379
There's no way those organ cops
can say I'm too healthy now.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.854
I'll order cholestyramine
for the itching

10:53.987 --> 10:55.588
and liver function testing
every few hours.

10:55.723 --> 10:56.957
I'll call UNOS
and do whatever I have to...

10:59.693 --> 11:01.028
...to get him
moved up the list.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.967
Where you
sneaking off to?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.436
I'm walking down the hall,
in plain sight.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.603
The alarms,
the pills,

11:10.738 --> 11:12.239
the classic Morgan
evasion techniques.

11:14.775 --> 11:18.378
You're getting your embryos
implanted, aren't you?

11:18.511 --> 11:21.481
Congrats on cracking
that already wide-open case.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.217
I have to give myself
a time-sensitive injection now,

11:24.351 --> 11:26.253
then yell at some
nice transplant people.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.988
Why didn't you tell me?
I could help.

11:28.121 --> 11:31.024
I'll refer you to the minutes
of our previous meeting--

11:31.158 --> 11:32.692
"We need boundaries."

11:42.335 --> 11:46.406
I remember you put on
my hospital socks
for me last time, too.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.075
I hate
that we have a routine.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.578
This time is different.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.116
- Hi.
- I love you.

11:56.249 --> 12:00.120
How are you?
Do you need anything?

12:00.253 --> 12:02.022
There's Funfetti cake in Pedes
for Nurse Hawks' birthday.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.256
Do you want me
to get you a piece?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.758
Just this is great.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.493
Please leave.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.928
Having visitors
increases the risk

12:08.061 --> 12:09.196
of perioperative infection,

12:09.329 --> 12:11.098
and stimulation
can raise blood pressure,

12:11.231 --> 12:14.501
which increases the risk of
intraoperative complications.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.376
I need to do
your pre-op exam.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.284
He just doubled over.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.620
My gut is trying
to kill me.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.754
Please, can you
give him something?

12:36.957 --> 12:39.626
I'll up his morphine.
Check the site for infection.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.761
Hang on.
You're gonna be okay.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.033
Dr. Allen,
his wound dehisced.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.968
What does that mean?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.002
His muscles couldn't
hold the stitches.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.470
It tore open.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.882
Move the patch
three millimeters
to your right.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.150
It should overlap
with the wound margin.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.717
- Got it.
- Yes, there.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.319
That is good.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.620
Dr. Wolke,
take the scope, please.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.056
Sutures.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.491
5-0 Prolene sutures
in the myometrium defect

13:11.624 --> 13:13.894
need to be placed
exactly one millimeter apart.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.495
Dr. Murphy,
take one more step,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.164
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.900
Applying the glue.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.402
No, no.
That's too far.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.437
- The view is obscured.
- Shaun.
A little to your left.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.642
She's bleeding.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.212
No signs of rupture.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.014
You may have placed
the sutures too deep

13:34.147 --> 13:35.382
because you didn't
have a clear view.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.884
The sutures are fine.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.518
I should take over.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.754
- Shaun.
- There, a small bleed
underneath the patch.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.190
Must've nicked
a vessel.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.224
I'll clip it.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.061
Suction.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.934
Okay, we can continue
to close.

13:54.067 --> 13:57.037
Yes.
Lea and the baby are fine.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.206
In spite of
the avoidable errors.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.612
His abdominal wall
is too weak and damaged

14:05.745 --> 14:07.547
from prior surgeries
to hold the sutures.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.748
We covered the wound
with plastic,

14:08.882 --> 14:10.217
but we need to take him
back to the OR

14:10.350 --> 14:11.584
and close him up
before it gets infected.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.153
The tissue will just
tear open again.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.755
His skin and muscles need time
and nutrition to heal.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.524
I have a small bowel
for Drew.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.064
Drew's wound dehisced.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.865
We can't take
that organ.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.969
I'm not
turning it down.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.870
This is Drew's
only chance.

14:34.741 --> 14:35.976
Tell UNOS we need to
run some more tests.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.444
Buy us a few hours.

14:37.577 --> 14:38.745
That's how long we have
to figure out

14:38.878 --> 14:40.247
how to stitch
this kid back together.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.394
What about
component separation?

14:54.527 --> 14:56.429
That could weaken the tissue
even more.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.830
Right.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.467
Maybe a four-step
Fabian procedure.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.669
Except Drew doesn't
have time for four steps.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.289
Hi.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.192
Here to check
Lea's post-op vitals.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.427
I also brought supplements.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.661
Mm.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.697
Thank you.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.100
All right, your post-op
ultrasound looks good.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.301
Oh.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.737
Fetal movement and heart tones
are great.

15:37.870 --> 15:38.972
Oh, thank God.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.874
When can I go home?

15:42.009 --> 15:44.011
You need to be here
for monitoring

15:44.144 --> 15:46.013
for several more days.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.350
I can't go days like this, Shaun.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.319
I hate it here.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.887
You are here
for work every day.

15:55.022 --> 15:59.392
Not in this room,
in this bed,

15:59.526 --> 16:01.161
thinking about everything.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.699
Jerome and I can visit
on our lunch break.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.835
Oh, we could take the "What
Yankee Candle Are You?" quiz

16:08.968 --> 16:10.870
that's on page 17.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.406
Rest will help you
recover faster

16:13.540 --> 16:16.609
so you don't have
to be here anymore.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.011
Her ultrasound
does look good.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.346
Thank you.
You can go.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.252
Thank you.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.365
UNOS called again.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.067
I told them we have to re-run
Drew's liver function test

16:40.200 --> 16:41.434
and get a CT scan.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.303
I bought us an hour
at most.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.637
What about
a Sure-Closure device?

16:44.771 --> 16:46.373
Too high a risk
for ventral hernia,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.541
which could lead to us needing
to resect his large intestine,

16:48.675 --> 16:50.377
leaving him
even worse off.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.778
I already played it out.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.384
For your embryo thing,
you know, whenever that is,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.152
I can give you a ride,
if you need one.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.723
I'll get an Uber.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.592
You really want to go to
the most important appointment

17:05.725 --> 17:08.095
of your life
with a stranger in a Camry?

17:08.228 --> 17:13.100
I've chosen to do this alone,
and I'm fine with it.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.767
And I'm--
I'm trying very hard

17:14.901 --> 17:18.938
not to care about what
anyone else thinks about that.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.474
So having you imply how sad
it is that I have to take a cab

17:21.608 --> 17:25.212
to a doctor's office
is not helpful.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.792
He threw up, and his pain
is getting worse.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.828
He's already maxed out
on morphine.
I'm overriding.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.296
There's increased
redness and swelling
on the edges.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.697
Early signs
of infection.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.032
I love you, Mom.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.335
- You're gonna be fine.
- It's okay.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.837
We knew
we'd get here someday.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.439
I'm ready.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.674
No.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.145
I am not
giving up on you.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.679
Don't give up on me, D.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.448
Please.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.858
Oh.
I-I will take those.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.865
They're from
all the nurses.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.134
We just want you both to know
that we're thinking about you.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.836
I will
pass that along.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.373
But not these.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.376
Baby's breath has
a strikingly unpleasant odor.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.513
Is there anything
you need?

18:35.282 --> 18:36.483
We're fine.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.188
Uh, 502's family
is on their way in.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.722
Heads up--
they are a loud bunch.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.491
They're very excited
to be taking Meemaw home.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.966
I don't think
Lea's fine.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.036
She's lonely
and bored,

18:57.170 --> 18:59.272
and being back
in that room

18:59.406 --> 19:01.774
is bringing up
a lot of painful memories.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.377
And I know you're just--
you're trying to protect her,

19:04.511 --> 19:05.878
but...

19:07.480 --> 19:09.716
but it's making you
kind of a pain in the ass.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.019
Your wife, who's carrying
the tiny human,

19:14.454 --> 19:16.456
she needs
her loud bunch.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.859
People asking how she is doing
and being worried

19:19.992 --> 19:22.895
will only make Lea worry more,
and that is not helpful.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.498
Not for you,

19:25.632 --> 19:29.736
but I think Lea needs more
than just you right now.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.439
She needs lots of people
showing concern and love.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.543
And maybe you do, too.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.778
More than you think.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.726
<i>♪ I think of when...♪</i>

19:53.860 --> 19:55.695
Question for you.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.897
Does it bother you that this
has been sitting here

19:58.030 --> 19:59.866
for three months?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.968
No.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.936
- Does it bother you?
- No.

20:06.072 --> 20:10.277
I'm feeling
a little pressured.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.578
I've barely
brought it up.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.581
And I appreciate that.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.951
But it sitting here
is kind of pressure.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.953
It was meant to be
a cute gesture.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.955
A subtle...

20:23.089 --> 20:25.392
Not so subtle reminder

20:25.525 --> 20:27.994
that the offer is still
"on the table,"

20:29.629 --> 20:31.331
which has clearly
overstayed its welcome,

20:31.464 --> 20:33.600
and the last thing I want
is for it to come between us.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.307
Are you un-proposing?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.409
No, I'm un-pressuring.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.981
I love you, and I'm not
going anywhere.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.518
When you're ready,
we'll put it back on the table.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.524
What about
a Velcro biocompatible patch?

20:57.657 --> 21:00.026
It would facilitate
his granulation tissue growth.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.862
How do we keep it from adhering
to other organs?

21:02.995 --> 21:04.130
Yeah.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.340
This should be turmeric chicken
with asparagus.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.546
That's what I was gonna
make you for our date.

21:19.679 --> 21:23.249
And after work, all I had to do
was go to the store
and get some chicken.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.955
But instead,
I-I texted my dealer.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.492
For a thousand reasons,

21:32.625 --> 21:36.162
none of which excuse
nor explain anything.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.333
You don't owe me
an explanation.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.668
I do.

21:42.935 --> 21:46.038
And I wish
I could give you one.

21:46.172 --> 21:49.676
Every day for the past 92 days,
I've asked myself,

21:49.809 --> 21:52.278
"Why didn't I just
go get the chicken?"

21:52.412 --> 21:54.681
I mean, we would have had
a great dinner.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.684
I mean, you would have been
funny and beautiful.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.055
And I would have tried
way too hard to be charming.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.692
And then...

22:07.927 --> 22:08.861
...who knows?

22:13.666 --> 22:17.203
I'd give anything to go back,
start over.

22:19.506 --> 22:20.907
Give us a clean slate.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.912
Me too.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.458
What if we did that
for Drew?

22:38.591 --> 22:40.927
What if,
along with a new bowel,

22:41.060 --> 22:42.895
we gave him a whole new
abdominal wall?

22:43.029 --> 22:44.296
Clean slate.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.099
Has it ever
been done before?

22:56.509 --> 22:59.412
I'm gonna look down
and see...
someone else's abs?

23:00.847 --> 23:03.550
Replacing it is the only way to
get you a new small bowel.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.752
You'll be able to eat again.
You'll get stronger.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.956
What are the chances
it'll work?

23:10.089 --> 23:12.692
It's never been done in tandem
with another transplant.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.127
There are increased risks
of rejection or infection.

23:15.261 --> 23:18.798
But both organs
are in great shape
and a good match.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.467
It's our best shot
to save your liver

23:20.600 --> 23:22.134
and give your body
time to heal.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.772
Thank you so much.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.146
Okay.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.783
Well, let's do this.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.203
If we don't keep quiet,

23:57.336 --> 23:59.506
Shaun is gonna come down on us
with the hammer of Thor, okay?

23:59.639 --> 24:01.574
It's so nice to laugh.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.342
Enter Shaun
with a chest plate

24:03.476 --> 24:05.945
and a red cape
with the Mjolnir.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.917
I don't want to get kicked out
before I know--

24:11.050 --> 24:13.019
boy or girl?

24:13.152 --> 24:14.987
I have to start scoping out
the latest baby fashions.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.388
I don't know.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.027
I don't want to know.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.836
Last time, when we found out
we were having a girl,

24:29.969 --> 24:31.938
Shaun and I
were choosing her name.

24:32.071 --> 24:36.408
I liked Sage and Skylar
and Sofia.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.845
Something with an "S,"
after my grandma, Susie.

24:41.714 --> 24:44.016
And then she was... gone.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.087
And I can't do
that again.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.060
Maybe you should tell Shaun
about this.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.929
He's already so worried,
no matter what he says.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.267
And what if talking
about it just...

25:06.405 --> 25:07.473
I have something
for you.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.175
Mm?

25:10.910 --> 25:11.878
My faith.

25:13.412 --> 25:14.313
Not just in God.

25:15.381 --> 25:18.084
I have faith
in the surgery you had.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.787
I have faith
in you and Shaun,

25:23.089 --> 25:24.724
and that your baby,

25:25.524 --> 25:27.594
whatever it is,

25:27.727 --> 25:29.261
is going to be okay.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.104
Your 10-minute visit
has run over.

25:40.406 --> 25:41.708
I have to scrub in anyways.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.146
Pencil me in for the next
10-minute opening, Thor.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.984
Thank you.
I-I needed that.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.058
Mmph. Pfft.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.593
But not that.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.428
I kind of feel nauseous.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.634
We should do
another ultrasound.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.001
Mm.

26:25.284 --> 26:28.755
This surgery could buy you
a year, maybe more,

26:28.888 --> 26:31.457
give you back
some quality of life.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.226
But...

26:34.360 --> 26:35.962
it should be
what you want.

26:49.709 --> 26:52.144
You're 17
and you've suffered more

26:52.278 --> 26:54.513
than some people
their whole lives.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.149
No one would fault you
for deciding you're done.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.755
I can't.

27:04.657 --> 27:07.727
Your mom has given you
all the support in the world,

27:07.860 --> 27:09.595
but this is your fight.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.464
Do you want
to keep going?

27:16.102 --> 27:18.237
The worst part about
all of this is knowing

27:20.139 --> 27:22.208
one day, it'll end,

27:22.341 --> 27:23.676
and my mom
will be alone.

27:25.945 --> 27:29.816
She's been with me through all
the hardest parts of my life,

27:29.949 --> 27:32.584
and I won't be around
when she has to go through
the hardest part of hers.

27:33.352 --> 27:36.055
If I can put that off,

27:36.188 --> 27:38.858
if even for a little bit,
then I'm gonna do that.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.261
And hope that makes
the days she'll face alone...

27:43.629 --> 27:45.064
a little easier.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.746
You're all set.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.047
We'll take you
to surgery soon.

28:37.750 --> 28:38.951
I love you.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.756
And whatever happens...

28:45.858 --> 28:47.126
you don't need
to worry about me.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.931
I'll be okay.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.180
I love you, too, Mom.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.914
She was
feeling nauseous,
so I did an ultrasound,

29:42.048 --> 29:43.983
which detected increased
fluid in the abdomen,

29:44.116 --> 29:45.317
but then
she lost consciousness.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.854
It is almost certainly
internal bleeding.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.121
I'll scrub in,
right away.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.823
No, no, no.
You can't come in.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.159
- This is likely a complication
from the first surgery.
- Shaun--

29:53.292 --> 29:55.427
It is my fault,
and I need to fix it.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.363
Shaun, if we can't stop
the bleeding,

29:57.496 --> 30:00.366
we may have to
take Lea's uterus
in order to save her life.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.969
If we get there, we're gonna
make the decision quickly

30:03.102 --> 30:05.371
and with medical factors only,
no emotion.

30:05.504 --> 30:09.275
Lea would want me in there
in case we lose the baby.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.442
If that happens--

30:10.576 --> 30:11.911
<i>if</i> that happens,

30:23.822 --> 30:25.357
Surgical site looks good.
Patch is intact.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.527
No signs of acute
placental abruption.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.062
Bladder's clean.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.899
No blood coming
from the ovaries
or the fallopian tubes.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.901
And the bowel is intact.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.735
It's gotta be coming
from the uterus.

30:36.869 --> 30:40.072
If we clamp
the uterine vessels,
we may slow down the bleeding.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.640
But we put the baby
at risk.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.209
If we don't stop it soon,
we're gonna put Lea at risk.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.348
I'll clamp the internal iliac
on the side of the bleed.

30:49.481 --> 30:50.950
Buys us some time.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.718
Give two more units of blood
and stay four ahead.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.852
Retractor.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.623
If the site
is hemostatic,

30:57.756 --> 31:00.893
they will look
for placental abruption.

31:02.728 --> 31:08.567
Next, they will check
the bladder, ovaries,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.236
and fallopian tubes.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.739
Shaun.

31:19.711 --> 31:23.049
They can't clamp
the uterine vessels

31:23.182 --> 31:25.884
without hurting the baby,

31:26.018 --> 31:28.988
but they can place
an atraumatic vascular clamp

31:29.121 --> 31:30.656
on the internal iliacs,

31:30.789 --> 31:34.626
which will slow down the bleed
while they try to locate it.

31:42.468 --> 31:45.537
Once they stop the bleed,

31:47.406 --> 31:50.676
they should be able
to repair it

31:50.809 --> 31:52.311
and be done by...

31:54.580 --> 31:56.182
5:26.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.698
The surgery went
really well.

32:12.831 --> 32:13.865
You should be able to start
eating real food again

32:14.000 --> 32:15.567
in a few days.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.304
Better make sure my new
six-pack is looking good.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.640
The abdominal wall
is holding together.

32:21.773 --> 32:22.774
No signs of infection.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.013
We'll see how long
that lasts.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.780
One step at a time, D.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.318
We'll let you
get some rest.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.689
No alcohol in that new gut
of yours.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.127
Not for four more years.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.695
One step at a time, Mom.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.737
Hey, I don't want to help
because I feel bad for you.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.341
I feel bad for me.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.479
You're gonna be
an amazing mom

33:00.612 --> 33:03.682
because you're amazing at
whatever you put your mind to,

33:03.815 --> 33:05.717
and I'm a little
conflicted, I guess,

33:05.851 --> 33:07.386
because I won't be
a part of it.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.856
Making my single-mother
IVF journey about you

33:10.989 --> 33:13.525
is uncharacteristically
self-absorbed.

33:15.027 --> 33:15.861
I'm impressed.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.864
You changed me.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.203
And doing things alone
isn't sad.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.540
Still doesn't mean
you have to do them that way.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.558
From here on, I'm gonna request
not to be supervised by you.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.396
Why?

33:53.265 --> 33:56.935
I didn't OD because of you,
or us.

33:57.069 --> 33:58.670
But I knew I couldn't
be with you

33:58.804 --> 34:00.739
if I wasn't okay.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.609
So I convinced myself
I was.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.147
Jordan, if I let myself
get close to you,

34:08.280 --> 34:11.483
I will fall for you again, and...

34:13.452 --> 34:15.421
...and I will want so badly
to be okay,

34:17.289 --> 34:18.324
to be ready for us.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.430
I can't risk that.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.135
I wouldn't want you to.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.773
Mm.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.109
I can't believe how much
I'm gonna miss somebody

34:37.243 --> 34:38.444
I'll still see every day.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.615
Lea's in
emergency surgery.

34:50.689 --> 34:51.823
Two more units,
right away.

34:51.957 --> 34:52.824
Removing the packing
over the uterus.

34:53.359 --> 34:54.626
Suctioning.

34:57.129 --> 34:59.465
Fetal heart rate 101.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.533
Intermittent decels.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.835
No injury
to the vena cava.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.137
Where is all this
coming from?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.773
Art line BP is 75 over 43

Lea's left uterine artery was

As the uterus grew,
it ruptured.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.374
That was inevitable.

37:55.507 --> 37:58.344
Had nothing to do
with your first surgery.

37:58.477 --> 38:01.046
Okay.

38:01.179 --> 38:05.250
Had Lea not been
in the hospital
when this happened,

38:05.384 --> 38:07.386
she might not have survived.

38:07.519 --> 38:10.556

Good morning.

39:17.222 --> 39:18.624
Can I get that to go?

39:18.757 --> 39:21.059
I gotta stop at my place
and grab a shirt for work.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.430
I'm sure you have a minute. Stay.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.298
- Am I about to be punished
for something?
- No.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.739
- I was just thinking.
- Mm-hmm.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.308
I love you.

39:38.243 --> 39:39.411
I love you, too.

39:39.545 --> 39:40.479
And I love us.

39:40.612 --> 39:42.914
Same.
Always good to hear.

39:43.048 --> 39:46.652
And I've decided I want us
to move forward.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.555
At my own, learning-to-walk
kind of pace.

39:56.294 --> 39:57.763
Clay Porter...

40:01.833 --> 40:04.135
...will you
move in with me?

40:04.269 --> 40:05.871
I would kneel,
but I'm not sure

40:06.004 --> 40:07.773
I could gracefully
get back up again.

40:09.441 --> 40:11.042
It's so sparkly.

40:11.176 --> 40:12.277
Love it.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.781
Mm.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.149
Audrey Lim...

40:20.819 --> 40:23.288
...you've made me
the happiest man alive.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.743
This is a one-time thing.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.078
Don't expect me to drive you
to your next colonoscopy.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.815
And here I was looking
forward to that.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.316
Take McLaughlin
to William Street.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.151
The freeway's backed up
this time of day.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.687
Alright, just don't
forget the tip.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.938
The fleece patch is
holding well and expanding
with the uterus.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.206
Everything looks great.

41:15.340 --> 41:18.744
Your baby is very cute
and squirmy.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.146
So, you wanna know
what it is?

41:29.521 --> 41:32.223
Y-You already know,
don't you?

41:34.826 --> 41:38.196
I have been looking
at your uterus a lot.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.464
Mm.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.733
But-- But I can
keep a secret.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.579
The light blue
is very...

41:53.712 --> 41:55.413
Heteronormative.

41:55.547 --> 41:58.383
I was going to say pastel.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.451
But, yes, that too.

42:00.586 --> 42:03.589
I think he's gonna like
something in the gray palette.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.523
Calming but warm.

42:05.657 --> 42:08.159
Elegant yet understated.

42:10.729 --> 42:14.165
I think our son
would like that very much.
