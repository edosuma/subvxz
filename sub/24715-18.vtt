ANDY: <i>Previously on </i>NYPD Blue.

00:02.711 --> 00:05.296
You and the Chief of Personnel
are buddies, right, Gibson?

00:05.422 --> 00:06.423
We’re friendly.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.675
Chief of Personnel,
who’s Hatcher’s uncle?

00:08.842 --> 00:11.052
We were gonna be short a man.
Stan was available.

00:11.302 --> 00:15.056
That’s fine, but if the day comes
when he needs to get tossed out of here,

00:15.181 --> 00:16.391
you better have the spine.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.144
You put in your papers by five o'clock,

00:19.477 --> 00:21.980
or you get charged with conspiracy
to commit murder.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.482
I was in a tough spot.
I didn’t handle it well.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.027
And I feel like
I, uh, really let you down.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.404
You gotta stand up
for what you believe in, Gibson,

00:29.487 --> 00:31.990
-not just some of the time.
-I understand.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.543
Sir, this was just dropped in my lap.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.879
As I said to my supervisor...

00:46.087 --> 00:48.214
No, of course I can handle it, but...

00:48.840 --> 00:50.216
I understand. (SIGHS)

00:51.176 --> 00:52.927
You know an ADA named Larry Lidveck?

00:53.219 --> 00:56.181
Uh, that nervous guy, right?
Always looks like he’s under the gun?

00:56.389 --> 00:57.640
More than we knew.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.602
Quit without notice yesterday.
Boss divvied up his cases.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.645
Name Leonard Peeler ring a bell?

01:04.481 --> 01:08.151
That’s, uh, rape homicide.
It’s going back a ways, what’s up?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.195
Jailhouse informant,
who said Peeler admitted

01:10.320 --> 01:11.571
the crime to him, recanted.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.948
-When did this happen?
-A couple of weeks ago.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.825
He’s dying of aids, found God.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.745
Either way, his new statement
got appellate counsel interested.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.832
They landed Peeler a DNA test.
Which came back negative.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.876
Peeler’s DNA came back negative?

01:25.210 --> 01:28.338
From the DNA taken off the girl
he was convicted of raping and killing.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.674
An old case of mine goes active,
and nobody advises me till now?

01:31.758 --> 01:34.886
Larry Lidveck wasn’t exactly
crossing his T’s.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.846
He just admitted himself into rehab.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.474
-So what now, then?
-VALERIE: There’s a one o'clock hearing,

01:39.766 --> 01:42.102
where I’m sure the defense
is gonna push for a motion

01:42.227 --> 01:43.686
to dismiss the charges.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.189
I’m trying to familiarize myself
with the case.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.817
It was a good collar
and a jury convicted his ass.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.236
Circumstantial case, though.
No eye witness.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.445
No.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.990
(CLEARS THROAT) Look,
if the DNA wasn’t his,

01:56.074 --> 01:58.493
maybe he had an accomplice
who he had never flipped on.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.287
Or maybe the girl had
had sex with someone else earlier.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.958
-She was 12.
-Well, I’m just saying this isn’t good.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.335
So, you need to help me
keep this case together.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.337
Otherwise, we’re gonna
have to prove it again,

02:09.420 --> 02:11.673
without the snitch
and with DNA working against us.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.299
It was a good arrest.

02:13.758 --> 02:17.178
We had Peeler with the girl,
an hour before she was killed.

02:17.428 --> 02:20.098
His alibi didn’t pan out,
or his timeline.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.059
Okay, here’s a copy of the file.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.270
I need to get caught up,
I’ll see you at 1:00.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.813
-Yeah, I’ll be there.
-VALERIE: Okay.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.991
-What do we got?
-Gary Keller.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.243
Big old head wound.
Wallet had been gone through.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.912
-Who found him?
-Kid over here, Royce Pearly.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.038
All right, we’ll take the kid.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.874
-Wanna start a canvass?
-RITA: We’re on it.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.543
Royce, you found him?

02:48.877 --> 02:51.838
-Just laying there, crazy.
-What got you in the alley?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.548
Ducked in from the breeze
to light my smoke.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.801
-Where were you headed to?
-School, NYU Nursing.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.388
-A nurse that smokes?
-Yeah, I know. I gotta quit.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.432
JOHN: You seen anybody suspicious around?

03:03.099 --> 03:04.934
Just him... dead.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.145
You ever seen him before?

03:07.228 --> 03:09.105
-No, but he’s dead now.
-You all right?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.149
Looking at him gets me
a little light-headed.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.818
Yeah, okay.
Anything else you need to tell us?

03:13.985 --> 03:17.322
Told you everything that I saw.
Now, do you mind if I take a seat?

03:17.697 --> 03:18.990
Yeah, over here.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.117
I’ll catch Andy up.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.246
-Hey.
-The guy who found him?

03:25.330 --> 03:28.208
(SCOFFS) Yeah, smoking nurse
who can’t take dead people.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.419
Hmm, DOA’s wallet got emptied.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.754
We got that.

Where have you been all morning?

03:37.467 --> 03:38.760
Heywood’s office.

Old homicide of mine
might get reopened off DNA.

-The guy was locked up?
-Yeah, the right guy.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.477
So, uh, who knows?

03:47.685 --> 03:48.978
His story straight?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.647
Yeah, it seems to be.
We’ll check him out.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.482
All right, let’s go on the canvass.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.901
How long was the guy locked up for?

03:57.111 --> 03:58.404
Eighteen years.

-Morning, John.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.108
New detective, very nice.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.194
JOHN: You meet her yet?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.114
Yeah, she, uh, transferred
in from Brooklyn North Narcotics.

-JOHN: What’s your take?
-Oh, we didn’t get past hello.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.330
Gentlemen, may I present
Detective Kelly Ronson.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.957
Just assigned to this command,
and we’re glad to have her.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.335
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.545
-His dad was also on the job.
-Huh.

EDDIE: Andy Sipowicz,

05:38.755 --> 05:39.756
-who I told you about.
-Yeah.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.591
-How’s it going?
-Good, thanks.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.634
EDDIE: Now this isn’t your ordinary
female cop.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.429
Kelly's an officer in the Policewoman’s
Endowment Association,

05:46.596 --> 05:48.681
and is working toward a law degree
at Fordham, huh?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.224
-How about that?
-Yeah.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.810
Yeah, I look forward
to learning from you guys.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.979
I told her this place can be hard
on new detectives,

05:55.063 --> 05:57.315
but she should expect a warm welcome.

05:57.690 --> 05:58.941
Sure.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.861
So, uh, the DOA?

06:13.748 --> 06:17.585
Uh, Detectives Ortiz and Ronson.
How long she been missing?

06:17.835 --> 06:20.755
A couple of days,
maybe a couple of years.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.382
It’s complicated.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.801
Okay, come on back.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.181
She’s here of her own merits.

No strings, no contracts,
no favors, no relation, okay?

06:34.018 --> 06:35.269
Did I say anything?

06:39.649 --> 06:42.443
Let’s see if we can uncomplicate this,
Alyssa.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.987
I just got out of Bedford Hills on Sunday.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.531
Three years for possession.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.784
I fell in with the wrong crowd.
Somebody asked me to hold a package.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.285
That’s all behind me now.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.579
-I cleaned up my act.
-Good for you.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.706
I got early parole off good behavior.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.958
Your missing baby?

06:57.166 --> 06:59.794
Right. So, before I go in, I give Zoe,

06:59.919 --> 07:02.130
that’s my baby girl,
to this friend of mine, Carla.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.631
At least I thought she was my friend.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.217
So, you gave Zoe to Carla to take care of
while you were in the joint?

07:06.342 --> 07:08.094
Yeah, exactly,
’cause she’s the responsible type,

07:08.177 --> 07:09.554
and she said that she’d do it.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.473
So, I go by her place,
first thing I get out,

07:12.640 --> 07:15.059
no Carla, no Zoe, no nothing.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.562
-And no idea where Carla went?
-Nope.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.897
And then that’s where you guys come in,
right?

07:20.022 --> 07:22.692
-Well, we’ll do everything we can.
-Yeah, that’s what I want to hear.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.986
Did you have any contact at all with Carla
when you were locked up?

07:25.111 --> 07:28.281
Yeah, as much as I could,
but I never got no response from letters,

07:28.364 --> 07:30.783
and I didn’t press it
’cause I was so grateful

07:30.867 --> 07:32.577
Zoe was being cared for.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.537
-How old’s Zoe?
-ALYSSA: Four.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.289
She got a father we could talk to?

07:36.539 --> 07:41.210
He’s doing 25 to life up at Coxsackie.
So, now you know everything.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.421
Well, we need
whatever you can give us on this, Carla.

07:43.504 --> 07:46.632
Last known address, phone number,
people who know her.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.886
She’s who got me through
those three years.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.679
-Your daughter?
-Yeah.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.473
Picturing her face.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.142
The hell if somebody’s gonna
take her away from me.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.686
-We’re gonna do everything we can.
-Yeah.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.648
Have a seat, folks.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.527
Once again, I’m very sorry
about your son and your brother.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.822
Thank you. Gary was
one of the good guys, you know?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.449
-JOHN: He lived in Connecticut?
-HUGH: Yeah.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.243
Beautiful home, two kids,
everything going for him.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.330
-And then he had to get sucked into this.
-Sucked into what?

08:17.705 --> 08:19.749
-Gary was just visiting.
-Mom, come on.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.042
He was, Hugh.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.169
HUGH: What you’re doing is disrespectful
to Gary’s memory,

08:23.377 --> 08:25.588
-to who he was as a person.
-What are we talking about?

08:25.838 --> 08:28.007
Gary was in town on account
of our younger brother Eric.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.343
-Who is fundamentally a good person.
-He’s a criminal.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.136
He is a decent person,
who is struggling

08:32.220 --> 08:33.721
with the same things
your father struggled with.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.349
-Dad wasn’t a junkie, Mom!
-Neither is your brother.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.602
-All right, enough.
-HUGH: Sorry. Just overwrought.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.356
What do you think your brother,
Eric has to do with Gary getting killed?

08:43.564 --> 08:46.609
(SIGHS) Gary came into town
to basically do an intervention on Eric.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.986
To me, it seemed very presumptuous.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.863
That’s because you still see him
as five years old!

08:50.988 --> 08:52.365
JOHN: Okay, guys.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.036
Gary was gonna see Eric
this morning about his drinking.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.122
His drugs, and basically
his overall nasty behavior

09:00.248 --> 09:01.624
toward the family and Mom.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.502
I’m not saying that Eric has something
to do with Gary’s death.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.630
But the people Eric keeps company with,
lowlifes.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.007
-So it may be one of them.
-Where does Eric live?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.218
Thirty-77, 12th Street,
near Second Avenue.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.053
JOHN: Now, that’s where Gary
was going this morning?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.888
’Cause where we found him
was nowhere near there.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.306
There were some calls back and forth.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.767
Gary said he was gonna go talk
to Eric, he didn’t say where.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.852
-JOHN: Do you know if Eric’s home now?
-He's not.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.521
I called this morning
when I heard about Gary.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.730
I don’t know where he could be.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.526
Eric didn’t have anything to do with this.
He couldn’t have hurt his brother.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.444
-She doesn’t understand drug addiction...
-I know his heart!

09:30.528 --> 09:32.905
All right, we’ll look into it
and be in touch.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.166
(SIGHS)

09:44.709 --> 09:47.128
I just got off with Gary Keller’s wife.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.463
The woman’s destroyed.
She could barely talk.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.631
What did she say, Medavoy?

09:50.715 --> 09:52.550
-I was making a point, Andy.
-Make it.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.968
GREG: She could barely talk,

09:54.093 --> 09:57.138
except when she goes railing on
against her husband’s family.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.390
-Then she got real clear.
-Saying what?

09:59.557 --> 10:01.851
They’re loony, invasive,
always at each other.

10:01.934 --> 10:02.977
Good to know.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.146
Did the family mention anything
about a warrant

10:05.229 --> 10:07.023

Eric had out on him in Florida?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.150
-No.
-Well, you know, check kiting.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.901
The mom put up the bond, ten grand.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.445
So the DOA, came into the city

10:12.528 --> 10:14.530
to bring his little brother back
to Florida?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.699
Or to convince him to go back
on his own or something, like that.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.826
No, the family didn’t mention it.
You think they would?

10:19.327 --> 10:24.081
-So, Andy, sit on Eric’s apartment?
-Uh, I’ll meet you there.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.542
(CLEARS THROAT)
I gotta run out on something.

10:38.012 --> 10:41.015

-African violets.

Breeding amount.
Winning all sorts of awards.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.021
So, what brings you, Andy?
Just paying respects?

10:47.104 --> 10:50.358
Actually, Joe, remember a guy
that we put away in ’86?

10:50.566 --> 10:52.193
Leonard Peeler?

10:52.276 --> 10:55.279
’86... don’t talk to me about ’86.
That’s when Doris left me.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.281
She remarried. Some guy
she knew at high school.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.076
They met up again
at their 40th high-school reunion.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.536
Leonard Peeler, do you remember?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.872
Peeler, Peeler, Peeler.
I remember the name.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.082
-Black guy.
-ANDY: Right.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.042
-Raped and killed a white girl.
-Yeah.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.002
And, uh, one of the things
that put him away

11:10.169 --> 11:13.089
Was this jailhouse snitch,
a guy named Earl Bezdeck.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.342
Oh, Bezdeck, good Lord.
What a hoople that guy was.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.885
He was an informant of yours.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.554
Yeah, he was a pretty good snitch,
but, uh, what a hoople.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.140
Well, turns out, Earl’s dying of AIDS.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.685
(CHUCKLES) I don’t even want
to hear how he got it.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.353
Apparently, what he’s saying now

11:27.436 --> 11:29.689
is that Leonard Peeler
never confessed to him.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.982
The AIDS must be doing something
to his brain.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.944
What that did though,
was get Peeler a DNA test.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.195
It came back negative.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.823
I don’t go for that hocus-pocus DNA stuff.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.741
Actually, it’s pretty accurate.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.494
So, what are you asking, Andy?

11:43.786 --> 11:46.539
-Did I put bad one on this Peeler?
-ANDY: No.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.249
’Cause I would never
do that in a million years.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.127
I’m saying that...
maybe we missed something,

11:51.210 --> 11:52.336
the both of us.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.089
Leonard Peeler,
sheet as long as my arm, right?

11:55.256 --> 11:57.216
He didn’t do this,
he did ten things just like it.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.968
(SCOFFS) Don’t work that way.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.345
-A jury convicted him.
-I know.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.849
Then what are we talking about?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.852
We may have to retry Peeler,
if this gets kicked back.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.318
My first squad.
Eighteen of 22 already dead.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.695
You know why?

12:17.778 --> 12:20.114
’Cause the job kept eating
at them after they left.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.240
Well, not me.

12:21.532 --> 12:25.828
Ruth and Philip Kaplanski.
I put away their son’s killer in ’75.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.458
Thank you card on his birthday.
Every year.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.753
That’s what I remember about the job,
and you should, too.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.255
Good talking to you, Andy.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.426
You take care of yourself.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.179
Yeah. You, too, Joe.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.151
RITA: So what are you going
to law school for?

12:57.234 --> 12:59.695
KELLY: I don’t know yet.
Just... I always had an interest.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.615
I got a scholarship through the job,
thought I’d take advantage of it.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.659
But I love being a cop.
I wouldn’t want anyone thinking different.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.411
-RITA: Sure.
-KELLY: 'Cause, uh...

13:07.495 --> 13:10.247
that whole thing
with the boss reading my resume,

13:10.372 --> 13:11.957
-that was a little embarrassing.
-(CHUCKLES)

13:12.166 --> 13:14.293
Well, no one will hold it
against you for being sharp.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.920
Ah, that’s good to hear, 'cause,

13:16.045 --> 13:18.798
other places I've been,
they read my ambition as attitude.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.424
And that’s absolutely not the case.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.510
All I care about
is how we work as partners.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.386
Sounds good.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.264
RITA: Police.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.517
-About what?
-RITA: Let’s talk inside.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.227
-CARLA: About what?
-Zoe Huber.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.145
-She here?
-Wow, uh...

13:33.395 --> 13:34.855
We need to talk now.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.651
We have to know where Zoe is.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.028
This is coming from Alyssa, Zoe’s mom?

13:41.111 --> 13:42.822
She’s out of the joint.
She wants her daughter back.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.574
CARLA: Oh, that’s just great,
good for her.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.536
-What a tool.
-Carla, is the little girl here?

13:48.744 --> 13:50.579
Of course not. I only had her
for about six months.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.832
-Then what?
-I got her to someone else.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.960
The girl was put in your care.
And what? You just got sick of her?

13:56.043 --> 13:57.419
CARLA: Hold the phone, lady, okay?

13:57.503 --> 13:59.421
I was asked to care
for that kid two hours.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.882
-Alyssa abandoned that girl to me.
-How?

14:02.299 --> 14:03.676
I knew Alyssa from the building.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.553
She shows up one morning,
completely loaded,

14:05.719 --> 14:07.805
asking me to watch her kid till noon.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.224
Two days later,
I get word she’s locked up.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.767
Did you try to contact her?

14:11.934 --> 14:15.104
Yeah, like 50 times. I tell her
she’s gotta arrange for her kid.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.481
She’s keeps telling me,
"I’m working on it, I’m working on it."

14:17.731 --> 14:20.025
Then she stopped calling
and ignored my letters.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.696
I mean, come on.
I have three kids of my own.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.948
-I couldn’t afford it.
-So, you gave the baby away?

14:26.156 --> 14:29.368
To Alyssa’s relative,
a cousin of hers or something.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.203
How about social services, Carla?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.539
-You even think of calling them?
-No way.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.207
They near took one of my boys.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.918
Called him "failure to thrive"
when all he had was a cold.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.920
I was not inviting them in again.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.091
The name of this cousin
and where we can find him.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.969
Jason Mathers.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.973
When I dropped off the kid,
he was living at Lefrak City.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.766
Better hope he’s still there.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.145
Or what? what did I do?

14:56.228 --> 14:59.064
Sit by the phone. We may need you again.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.906
-JOHN: Thanks.
-CASHIER: You got it.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.491
Tenant hasn’t seen Eric Keller
in a day or two.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.869
And says we’re not the only
ones looking for him.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.788
Hey.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.749
-Who are you?
-Roy.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.417
Roy, who are you?
What are you doing here?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.086
-Just waiting for a friend.
-Yeah? What’s the friend’s name?

15:21.420 --> 15:23.631
Joe. Joe Snagloff.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.382
All right. Stand up.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.635
Put your hands up.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.054
ROY: All right, uh...

15:30.220 --> 15:31.931
okay, yes, I’m looking for Eric Keller.

15:32.139 --> 15:35.601
Orange Grove Bail Bonds, Fort Lauderdale.
You a bounty hunter?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.061
Bail-enforcement agent.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.396
How long you been tailing Keller?

15:39.730 --> 15:41.231
-Three days.
-Any sign of him?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.944
Wait, what’s got you after Keller?
’Cause if he’s wanted in New York,

15:45.027 --> 15:47.321
there’s gotta be a way to work things,
so that you get what you want,

15:47.404 --> 15:50.658
-and I didn’t waste my time and gas money.
-Have you seen Eric Keller?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.911
Early this morning.
Elizabeth Court Hotel on Bowery,

15:54.078 --> 15:56.455
-but, uh, he got past me.
-How’d that go down?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.540
I got to his hotel room,
knock on the door.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.833
"Housekeeping."

15:59.917 --> 16:03.504
They open up, make me for who I am,
and then this brother of his, Gary,

16:03.837 --> 16:06.215
he throws a block at me
while Eric scoops out the window,

16:06.298 --> 16:09.009
so I follow him out,
but he had too good jump on me.

16:09.426 --> 16:11.095
Now, you left his brother,
Gary in the room?

16:12.179 --> 16:14.723
-How was he when you left him?
-How was he?

16:16.058 --> 16:17.184
He was fine.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.478
'Cause he was found dead in an alley
down the street from the hotel.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.065
Whoa! Now, I don’t know
anything about that.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.733
ANDY: He didn’t chase after you
going out the window,

16:24.817 --> 16:26.110
try to stop you pursuing his brother?

16:26.360 --> 16:27.945
-No, sir.
-You get into a fight with him

16:28.028 --> 16:29.571
-out on the street?
-Absolutely not.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.198
'Cause we’re gonna talk
to everybody at that hotel.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.993
And if you’re lying, Roy,
we’re gonna slam this on you.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.119
Talk to whoever you want.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.580
I left that guy in the room fine.
Healthy and alive.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.417
How’d you know to find Eric
at the Elizabeth Court Hotel?

16:41.500 --> 16:42.626
From his older brother, Hugh.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.963
So Hugh said, "My brother Eric
is at Elizabeth Court Hotel,

16:46.046 --> 16:47.131
"go snatch him up."

16:47.881 --> 16:51.760
He said, "My brother Gary’s is going
to meet my brother Eric... follow Gary."

16:52.136 --> 16:54.221
-This family’s a mess, man.
-ROY: Not my problem.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.973
What is though is getting Eric back
to Florida.

16:56.056 --> 16:59.268
So, since we’re both in the same team,
can we work something out?

16:59.351 --> 17:01.770
-Join forces?
-No. Don’t leave town.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.147
Keep your cell phone on.

17:10.279 --> 17:14.158
So, can you tell me what’s going on now?
Did you find my brother Eric or not?

17:14.450 --> 17:15.451
Not yet.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.203
But we did find a bounty hunter
who’s looking for him.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.290
-Uh-huh.
-What, "uh-huh"? That’s all you gotta say?

17:21.373 --> 17:22.750
’Cause we’d like to know
why you didn’t mention

17:22.833 --> 17:24.001
a bounty hunter to the other detectives.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.128
Well, I mean... I guess
it just didn’t come up.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.256
Your brother’s murdered, Hugh.
That kind of thing needs to come up.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.383
All right, I didn’t want to say
it in front of my mom.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.801
I didn’t want her to know
that I’ve been helping

17:32.885 --> 17:34.303
get Eric brought back to Florida.

17:34.386 --> 17:37.389
Wait, you didn’t want your mom knowing?
How old are you, Hugh?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.684
Eric’s her little angel, okay?
And she’s a frail old lady,

17:40.768 --> 17:42.644
but the time came for me
to put my foot down.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.814
How long have you known
about the bounty hunter?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.233
He called a week ago,
said he was looking for Eric.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.320
I didn’t even know Eric been busted.
Or that my mom put up this huge bond.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.405
All right, so you told the bounty hunter
that you’d help him out.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.241
I said if I heard any news of Eric,
I’d pass it on.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.285
She doesn’t have ten grand to blow.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.580
Did you pass on news
to the bounty hunter this morning?

18:01.663 --> 18:03.957
I called him last night,
when my brother Gary came into town.

18:04.124 --> 18:07.669
To do this intervention,
or were you lying about that?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.421
No, I wasn’t lying.

18:09.588 --> 18:13.175
It was to do an intervention, sort of.
But more, to tell Eric

18:13.300 --> 18:15.594
to be a man
and get his ass back to Florida.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.387
Well, how’d Gary wind up
stuck in the middle?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.808
For a long time, Gary’s been
the intermediary between me and Eric.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.853
-We’d pass messages through him.
-So, Gary goes to deliver your message,

18:25.020 --> 18:27.314
you have him followed,
and then somehow Gary ends up dead.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.774
Tragically.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.693
And what's the reason you couldn’t deliver
this message to Eric yourself?

18:32.194 --> 18:35.364
Because he’s a thief, a junkie,
and the shame of our family.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.782
I could go on. You got an hour?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.159
All right, Hugh, is there anything else
you’re not telling us?

18:39.243 --> 18:41.161
-No.
-And you have no idea

18:41.245 --> 18:44.456
-how Gary wound up dead?
-That’s a question for Eric.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.292
-GREG: Who you have no idea how to find.
-I don’t have a clue.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.169
On a lot of fronts, apparently.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.047
Excuse me? I’m in mourning here.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.632
Hmm.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.636
So, where are we with this missing kid?

18:57.845 --> 19:00.973
(SIGHS) Mom’s on the way back in.
We got some things we need to clear up.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.266
Have you found the kid yet, though?

19:02.391 --> 19:06.478
No, mom dumped it on a Carla Nichols,
who passed it off to a Jason Mathers.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.604
Mom’s second cousin.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.481
Who’s now doing three to five
in Rikers for assault.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.734
Corrections interviewed him before us.
Mathers says before he got locked up,

19:12.818 --> 19:15.237
he was living with a junkie
named Tonya Taylor.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.156
RITA: They had a fight
and Tonya split with the kid.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.325
Vice says Tonya’s a pross.
They’re keeping an eye out.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.244
You wanna rewind that?

19:22.369 --> 19:25.205
(SIGHS) It’s a game of hot potato, Sarge.
We’re nowhere.

19:27.624 --> 19:28.876
What’s up with him?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.879
Uh, he admitted to tipping off
the bounty hunter.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.090
That family’s like
the Hatfields and McCoys.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.719
If, you know, the Hatfields
and McCoys were all one family.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.054
Yeah, we need to get our hands on
the younger brother, Eric.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.431
Yeah, definitely.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.558
Yeah, somebody called me.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.185
-You?
-KELLY: That’s right.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.978
-In here.
-You find my daughter?

19:48.145 --> 19:49.438
No. Come on.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.024
-Then why’d you have me come here?
-Let’s go.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.864
-You got this handled, right?
-Yeah, go do what you gotta do.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.745
KELLY: You been drinking, Alyssa?

20:05.454 --> 20:08.457
Yeah, a little.
It was my friend’s birthday.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.292
KELLY: Out drinking
while your daughter’s missing.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.961
Maybe I should slit my wrists, that it?

20:13.045 --> 20:15.547
Your story about Carla
blowing off your letters?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.966
-She’s saying different.
-Yeah, well, she’s a liar.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.885
Next question?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.179
We just got a call from social services
a while ago,

20:22.262 --> 20:24.556
off you hassling them for your ADC check.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.516
They needed to verify
you got custody of the kid.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.560
-Yeah, and what’d you tell them?
-That we’re looking into it.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.437
No, you can’t tell them that.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.065
Because then the file gets
tossed up to the supervisor,

20:33.148 --> 20:34.900
and I’ll never get the check.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.443
Oh, my God!

20:36.652 --> 20:38.654
Is that what this is about?
Your welfare check?

20:39.196 --> 20:42.241
No, it’s not, and how dare you?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.868
But there’s money as a mother
that’s available to me.

20:44.993 --> 20:48.455
-So, what should I do? Turn it down?
-Is your baby alive?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.707
You tell me, you’re the cops.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.542
Because if this
is some kind of welfare scam,

20:52.626 --> 20:54.211
or if your baby is dead
and you’re just trying

20:54.294 --> 20:57.256
to point us in a different direction
and leave yourself out of it.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.841
ALYSSA: In the space of two minutes,

21:00.050 --> 21:05.138
you call me a liar, a drunk,
a thief, and what? A killer?

21:05.639 --> 21:08.976
All I am is a mother,
who wants her child back.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.395
If anything else you’ve told us
doesn’t clear,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.397
we book you for child abandonment,
you understand?

21:13.647 --> 21:16.441
-This is your last chance.
-I told you the truth.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.152
Now, please, just find my daughter.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.752
EARL: Thanks for coming by.
Appreciate it.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.466
-Detective Sipowicz.
-EARL: Sure, sure.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.094
-Joe Brockhurst's partner.
-Yeah, that’s right.

21:44.177 --> 21:45.345
EARL: Joe still around?

21:45.429 --> 21:46.972
He’s retired, but he’s still around. Yeah.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.682
You’re here
about the Leonard Peeler thing?

21:48.890 --> 21:50.225
I sure am.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.395
Well, then you must have heard.
And I’m sorry.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.606
I know you’re on your way out, Earl.
And like everybody else,

21:56.690 --> 21:59.401
who tries to buy their ticket
to heaven a little late,

22:00.027 --> 22:04.323
-there can be just a little overreaction.
-I’m telling you the truth, I swear.

22:04.406 --> 22:05.574
I’m not so sure about that.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.576
I think you might be trying
to get attention,

22:07.659 --> 22:09.369
by playing this, uh, martyr routine.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.579
You’re mistaken.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.540
Leonard Peeler raped
and killed a 12-year-old girl.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.668
He may well have done that,
but he never admitted it to me.

22:16.918 --> 22:20.297
And you’re changing your tune now,
that might end up setting this guy free.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.258
Leonard Peeler,
never admitted that to me.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.345
That’s all I know.
That’s all I can say.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.432
(COUGHING)

22:31.391 --> 22:32.517
Thanks.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.521
-What did he tell you?
-Nothing.

22:37.898 --> 22:41.109
We spent a half hour in a van,
on our way to Rikers.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.237
That’s when I said he told me
about killing that girl.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.447
In truth...

22:46.740 --> 22:49.826
-never said a word.
-Why did you make up the story?

22:50.327 --> 22:53.663
I knew he was the suspect.
I thought he did it.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.208
I kept on seeing that girl’s face.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.878
-From the photo in the paper.
-Don’t bullshit me.

23:00.003 --> 23:01.421
You were looking to help yourself out.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.591
Sure, but I also didn’t wanna
see Leonard Peeler

23:04.674 --> 23:08.220
-get away with killing that poor girl.
-And your conscience is all clear now.

23:08.303 --> 23:09.679
EARL: Not by a long shot.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.599
I gotta live with the guilt
that I helped put Leonard away

23:12.682 --> 23:13.934
for a murder that he didn’t commit.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.561
And the guy who did do it,
still out there.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.063
Preying on other victims.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.775
-If you’re trying to get attention here...
-I’m not.

23:22.692 --> 23:25.529
I’m doing God’s will
by telling you the truth.

23:25.946 --> 23:29.324
May He bless you, like He’s blessed me.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.628
STANLEY: The lab report
is absolutely clear.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.005
The DNA doesn’t match, Miss Heywood.

23:45.298 --> 23:47.801
Your Honor, I move to vacate
the conviction of Mr. Peeler,

23:47.926 --> 23:49.344
and to set aside the sentence immediately.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.012
The people oppose that motion.

23:51.179 --> 23:54.891
These results don’t exonerate
the defendant but at best, raise doubt.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.393
That’s absurd, Your Honor.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.438
Judge, the DNA could be from
a second unidentified subject,

23:59.646 --> 24:01.523
acting in concert with the defendant.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.983
RICHARD: There’s no second subject.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.569
Regardless, there’s independently
sufficient evidence

24:05.694 --> 24:06.695
to sustain the conviction.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.322
I’ve read the file, Miss Heywood.
(CLEARS THROAT)

24:09.406 --> 24:11.867
The people had a weak,
circumstantial case at best,

24:11.950 --> 24:13.827
and that was before the 440 motion.

24:14.035 --> 24:17.289
The assistant, who prosecuted
this case left my office, Judge.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.709
I’d like to conduct my own
investigation into this matter.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.212
That will entail reviewing the autopsy
and crime-scene reports.

24:24.379 --> 24:27.507
Your Honor, Mr. Peeler’s been in jail,
18 years.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.675
STANLEY: I understand.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.011
And unless the people
can establish why the defendant

24:31.219 --> 24:33.263
shouldn’t be free, he will be.

24:34.014 --> 24:37.559
-I hear the motion on Friday morning.
-Your Honor, I need more than three days.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.020
We are going to resolve this
matter before the week is out.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.605
Your Honor, I move that bail be set.

24:41.771 --> 24:44.566
Mr. Peeler has priors, he’s a flight risk.

24:44.816 --> 24:48.487
Motion to grant bail is denied.
We will reconvene Friday morning.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.779
RICHARD: Give it a day, Johnny.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.599
-Sit down, Tonya.
-Okay.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.019
We got some questions about a little girl,
you’re supposed to be taking care of,

25:21.102 --> 25:22.229
named Zoe Huber.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.815
Uh, I’m sorry, I wanna be helpful,
but, uh, I don’t know that name.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.485
Two and half years ago, you were given
a little girl to take care of.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.278
-No. (SNIFFLES)
-KELLY: Tonya,

25:30.487 --> 25:31.863
you got a cocaine habit?

25:32.239 --> 25:33.907
-No.
-You do.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.159
Start thinking straight
or we’ll put you in a cell

25:36.243 --> 25:38.119
-till you’re clawin’ at your skin.
-Come on.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.205
You were given a little girl.
What happened to her?

25:40.372 --> 25:41.998
(SIGHS) I can’t go to jail.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.794
You won’t if you’re straight with us.
But talk now or we’ll let you rot.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.964
(WHIMPERS)

25:49.381 --> 25:51.967
I was given a little girl to take care of.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.386
Jason Mathers gave you the baby?

25:55.720 --> 25:58.014
I thought it would be
a good thing for me.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.725
A reason to clean up,
but I just wasn’t prepared.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.353
-What happened to the baby?
-She went away.

26:03.645 --> 26:04.729
What does that mean?

26:04.980 --> 26:07.023
-TONYA: I had to make her go away.
-Did she die?

26:07.232 --> 26:10.110
She screamed so much, I felt so horrible.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.903
Did the baby die?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.990
(SOBS) I felt like a terrible person.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.866
A terrible mom.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.286
-(SOBS) Undeserving.
-Tonya!

26:20.453 --> 26:22.747
Answer my question
or I’ll put my fist in your mouth.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.708
-I gave her away.
-RITA: To who?

26:24.791 --> 26:27.669
-(SOBS) A Gloria, I think.
-Who is Gloria?

26:28.044 --> 26:31.923
From the soup kitchen
at St. Mark’s Place or St. Mark's Church.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.425
-Are you making this up?
-No!

26:33.550 --> 26:34.801
’Cause if you are,
you gotta tell us, right now.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.469
Gloria, I swear.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.598
Gloria from St. Mark’s
or St. Mark’s Church.

26:39.681 --> 26:42.267
I can’t remember which one. (WHIMPERING)

26:42.767 --> 26:44.603

-(PANTS)

26:47.647 --> 26:48.940

26:50.066 --> 26:51.735
-Hey.
-JOHN: Hey.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.112
How’d it go?

26:54.863 --> 26:55.947
Run the case.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.034
Uniform’s holding Eric Keller at a bar.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.453
Jones is downstairs.
I’m gonna run out and pick Eric up.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.913
Uh, Eric is the older brother,
who called the bounty hunter?

27:03.997 --> 27:05.832
No, he’s the younger brother,
the one the bounty hunter’s looking for.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.125
Yeah, right.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.503
Don’t worry. Got things covered.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.131
-Thanks.
-IRVIN: Can I help you?

27:13.632 --> 27:15.508
We’re Cindy Clifton’s Parents.

27:15.842 --> 27:19.054
I remember you, Mr. Clifton.
I’m Detective Sipowicz.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.222
And I’m very sorry
for what happened today.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.350
We’re not exactly sure
what happened, Detective.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.769
ANDY: The DA had to run on another case.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.312
-And you left so quickly.
-ANDY: Yeah.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.898
Unfortunately, I had
to get back to work, too.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.066
(CLEARING THROAT)

27:32.275 --> 27:33.860
Let’s, uh, let’s talk in here.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.117
-(DOOR CLOSING)
-Do we know what that’s about?

27:41.201 --> 27:43.828
(SIGHS) He’ll tell us
when the time’s right.

27:46.998 --> 27:50.001
This has been a very difficult
time for my family.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.587
-Very difficult day.
-I understand.

27:52.712 --> 27:55.256
And when that jury convicted Peeler,
we thought it was over.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.966
I thought it was, too.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.887
He’s had appeal after appeal.
State Court, Federal Court...

28:01.012 --> 28:04.516
how can he just have this test
so many years later?

28:05.183 --> 28:08.061
DNA testing wasn’t available
when he was convicted.

28:08.269 --> 28:11.022
So law says he’s got a right
to the test if he asks for it.

28:11.231 --> 28:15.068
And as a result of a witness
recanting his testimony,

28:15.652 --> 28:18.113
-that’s what happened.
-Did you arrest the wrong man?

28:18.196 --> 28:20.782
(CLEARING THROAT) Right now,
I’m looking at the possibility that...

28:21.074 --> 28:23.660
maybe there were two men involved.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.746
Which would account
for the DNA not matching.

28:27.414 --> 28:31.000
-Is Leonard Peeler gonna be released?
-I don’t know.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.669
Is the person, who raped my daughter...

28:33.503 --> 28:36.047
-who strangled her, who sodomized her...
-Gerald...

28:36.214 --> 28:39.050
Is that person still out there, Detective?
Huh?

28:39.342 --> 28:42.554
Yes or no?
We’re entitled to a simple answer!

28:42.679 --> 28:46.641
I’m sorry for your pain, Mr. Clifton.
And I wish this wasn’t happening.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.769
All I can do is promise
to find out what did happen.

28:51.521 --> 28:52.772
(SIGHS)

28:53.523 --> 28:59.070
You and your partner worked hard
on behalf of our family, Detective.

28:59.195 --> 29:02.490
-We haven’t forgotten that.
-And I haven’t forgotten Cindy.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.744
I will get to the bottom of this.
I swear to God.

-May I help you?

29:21.050 --> 29:22.844
-Mind if we come in?
-Sure.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.894
What a beautiful girl. How old is she?

29:31.144 --> 29:32.729
Emily’s four.

-What’s this about?
-Is Emily your only child?

29:37.025 --> 29:38.777
-Yes.
-KELLY: Are you the birth mother

29:38.860 --> 29:40.320
or is she adopted?

29:41.154 --> 29:44.324
Um, Emmie, sweetheart,
go play with your dollies, okay?

29:44.449 --> 29:46.367

-Okay. (CHUCKLES)

29:53.291 --> 29:55.668
Um, Emily’s... adopted.

29:56.085 --> 29:58.463
And do you have formal papers
from the agency to show us?

29:58.671 --> 29:59.839
Um...

30:00.590 --> 30:02.801
KELLY: Ma’am, I think
you know why we’re here.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.100
At this point, we’re just looking
to determine the condition of the child.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.144
Well, Emily is thriving.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.772
She’s in nursery school now.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.775
Jerry just got made partner
at his CPA firm.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.528
So, financially, we’re stable.
And I don’t work,

30:21.653 --> 30:24.322
so whenever Emily’s home,
she gets full-time attention.

30:24.572 --> 30:27.075
-How long has she been with you?
-Two years.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.202
We couldn’t conceive on our own.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.329
Adoptions kept falling through
and she was...

30:32.413 --> 30:34.249
an answered prayer, really.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.501
Did you pay for the child?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.211
Absolutely not.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.548
A woman at the soup kitchen,
where I volunteered,

30:41.714 --> 30:44.133
basically put Emily on our doorstep.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.513
-You’ll need to stay available.
-(SIGHS) Okay.

30:50.056 --> 30:53.017
Um... we love her.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.311
We’d do anything for her.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.939
I just want you to know
that before you take her away.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.525
No one’s doing anything right now,
so don’t panic.

31:01.401 --> 31:02.527
We’ll be in touch.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.330

From all we heard, he was a good guy.

31:14.497 --> 31:15.582
ERIC: Yeah.

31:15.748 --> 31:18.126
We also heard that,
uh, Gary was stuck in the middle

31:18.293 --> 31:20.712
-between you and your brother Hugh?
-Yeah, he's a prick.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.715
So, did Gary show up
at your place this morning,

31:23.840 --> 31:24.883
as a spokesman for you?

31:24.966 --> 31:27.719
-I guess, sort of.
-What’d you talk about?

31:27.844 --> 31:30.930
Gary said, uh, he had got his panties
in a bunch,

31:31.014 --> 31:34.017
on account of a scrape
I got into, in Florida.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.935
And that I need to go, sort it out.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.521
This is about you jumping bail.
Put your Mom out ten grand.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.774
I was gonna take care of it.
I’m still gonna.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.402
Did it get your back up a little?
Gary needling you

31:44.611 --> 31:45.945
about something
you’re gonna do regardless?

31:46.070 --> 31:48.406
What? Needling me
or who it was coming from?

31:48.489 --> 31:49.908
All right, brown-nose Hugh.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.826
-Who was he brown-nosing?
-ERIC: My mom.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.704
He thinks he’s being a man.
Standing up for her,

31:54.787 --> 31:57.457
but he's just whining for attention.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.542
All right, so you had all this anger
at Hugh.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.295
This deep-seated, life-long anger.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.923
And here, Gary shows up
as Hugh’s mouthpiece.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.884
-Had to piss you off.
-Like I said,

32:07.967 --> 32:10.553
it wasn’t Gary I was pissed at.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.221
Yeah, but Gary’s the one
who ended up dead.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.848
What are you asking me?

32:13.973 --> 32:15.934
-Did you have anything to do with it?
-Oh, come on!

32:16.017 --> 32:18.603
Gary came to see you on an errand,
from a guy you hate.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.063
Gary winds up dead a block away.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.648
Now, you see how we might
put those together?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.608
The last time I saw Gary...

32:24.525 --> 32:28.071
he was helping me escape
from that bounty hunter asshole.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.198
All right. Describe that.

32:30.406 --> 32:33.034
(STAMMERING) Gary’s in my room,
ten minutes.

32:33.159 --> 32:35.453
And there’s a knock at the door,
for housekeeping.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.872
Which there isn’t, in that fleabag hotel.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.917
So, Gary says,
"Break for the fire escape."

32:41.000 --> 32:42.585
He’ll hold the guy back.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.171
I went for the fire escape.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.965
End of story.

32:48.007 --> 32:49.592
Did the bounty hunter
follow you out the window?

32:49.842 --> 32:52.053
-Nobody followed me.
-What about Gary?

32:52.220 --> 32:53.429
That was the last time I saw him.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.139
So, you didn’t meet up with him
around the corner?

32:55.306 --> 32:56.683
-No!
-JOHN: You didn't meet up with him,

32:56.933 --> 32:59.352
and have an argument
about how screwed up your life’s gotten?

32:59.477 --> 33:03.356
-Wanted man. Guys hunting you down.
-He wanted to help me.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.191
BALDWIN: Eric, you run from trouble.

33:05.441 --> 33:08.152
Now, did you give your brother,
Gary, a smack to get away from him,

33:08.277 --> 33:11.030
-thinking you could make it up later?
-I didn’t kill Gary.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.283
Gary was a great guy. I admired him.

33:14.617 --> 33:17.286
He got out of here,
away from this family.

33:17.912 --> 33:20.415
Hugh? He’s nothing to me, man.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.584
Gary was my brother.

33:24.836 --> 33:25.837

What you think, I forget who you are?

33:44.272 --> 33:48.317
-I’m here to find out what happened.
-You locked up the wrong man.

33:48.776 --> 33:51.821
With the DNA coming back negative,
that leaves a couple scenarios.

33:51.904 --> 33:54.490
That leaves one scenario
I didn’t do that crime.

33:54.782 --> 33:57.952
Or there was two of you involved,
and that DNA belongs to a buddy of yours.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.204
What’s it gonna take
for you to get it, man?

34:00.288 --> 34:02.582
I didn’t rape that girl.
I didn’t kill that girl.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.250
I didn’t lay a fingertip on that girl.

34:04.375 --> 34:08.129
So unless you come here to apologize,
there’s nothing to talk about.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.340
If there was a second guy involved,

34:11.424 --> 34:12.800
and you’ve been protecting him
this whole time...

34:12.967 --> 34:13.968
Officer!

34:14.052 --> 34:15.887
ANDY: Look, I wanna find out
what happened here, Leonard.

34:15.970 --> 34:17.180
You want to cover your ass

34:17.305 --> 34:19.307
so you don’t have to face up
to what you’ve done to me.

34:19.390 --> 34:20.475
Yo, officer!

34:20.725 --> 34:22.769
If I didn’t wanna face up to it,
I wouldn’t be here right now.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.104
You didn’t believe me then.
You don’t believe me now.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.439
But I don’t give a damn.

34:26.689 --> 34:28.775
’Cause DNA proves it
whether you like it or not!

34:28.941 --> 34:31.027
I did my job and a jury convicted you.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.197
-I don’t want to talk to him no more.
-We still have witnesses, Leonard.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.699

and your timeline problems.

-What?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.115
Zoe died a year ago.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.577
She got passed through
five different people, ended up in Ohio.

-She got pneumonia.
-KELLY: We’re sorry.

But here’s the problem, Alyssa,
and it’s a big problem.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.629
Our boss wanted an update,
and we gave it to him.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.631
His response was that
you should be arrested,

35:33.798 --> 35:36.759
-and your parole violated.
-For what? I didn’t kill her.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.345
The way he’s looking at it,
indirectly, you did.

35:39.512 --> 35:43.516

-I’ve been in jail.
-KELLY: We understand that.

35:46.352 --> 35:47.854
And seeing as you’ve been
through a lot already,

35:47.979 --> 35:51.524
and you’re looking to make a clean start,
we asked our boss to cut you a break.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.442
-I’m no... I’m not arrested?
-KELLY: No,

-I follow Eric.
-Well, some folks at the hotel are saying

36:57.089 --> 36:59.425
you left through the front door,
not down the fire escape.

37:00.259 --> 37:01.844
Right. Yeah, okay.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.180
All right, so, you spent
a little more time with Gary

37:04.263 --> 37:05.556
in the hotel room than you said?

37:05.640 --> 37:07.934
-Struggling with him, maybe?
-Uh, just to get around him.

37:08.017 --> 37:10.728
-You carry a stun gun?
-I thought we were working on a deal here.

37:10.811 --> 37:13.689
The deal is we’re trying
to save your ass here, Roy,

37:13.814 --> 37:14.815
which is a little difficult,

you’ve been telling us.

I don’t like people
thinking I can’t do my job.

Because I don’t...
I don't have a lot of size.

37:34.585 --> 37:37.380
Did you use a stun gun
on Gary Keller in the hotel room?

37:37.505 --> 37:41.217
Or did the stun-gun marks the ME
found come from the maid?

Then a little professional courtesy
for fellow law enforcement.

Yes, twice.

But like I said before,

from being hit with a stun gun five times.

That’s what killed him.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.451

he was hit in the head in the alley,

38:07.535 --> 38:08.619
beside the hotel.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.913
Oh, the ME came back
saying he got the head wound

-No.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.551

was gonna be armed.

in that room aggressive

like a professional,

-Criminally negligent homicide.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.474
That’s jail time?

39:11.849 --> 39:15.811
Once with a stun gun, maybe twice,
you could argue self-defense.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.690

(SIGHS) I’m sorry you had to enter

-We did.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.189

-Hey.

I didn’t wanna talk about this
in front of Connie and the kids.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.265
No problem, just came by
to see how you’re doing.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.891
Fine, yeah, all right.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.978
I’m not gonna sit around
and beat myself up over it.

40:39.061 --> 40:41.772
Why would you?
A jury convicted this guy.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.609
This was one of those
where you’re 90 percent sure, you know,

40:45.734 --> 40:47.403
which is enough to the sign off on it.

40:47.486 --> 40:50.406
But that ten percent,
it’s like a little rock in your shoe.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.867
That snitch lied to you saying to you
saying that Peeler confessed to him.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.368
Now, how’s it your fault?

40:55.953 --> 40:58.998
One of the things that worked
against Peeler was his timeline.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.501
(SIGHS) He couldn’t remember
when he left the bar 'cause he was drunk.

41:02.626 --> 41:04.837
And my partner Joe,
he kept on hammering on him,

41:04.920 --> 41:06.839
"I need a time, I need a time."

41:06.922 --> 41:08.674
Finally, he told Peeler,
"Just ballpark it."

41:08.799 --> 41:10.342
So Peeler says, "Five o'clock."

41:10.426 --> 41:12.470
And that’s what he wrote up
in the statement.

41:12.887 --> 41:13.971
Well, right after that,

41:14.180 --> 41:17.391
we found people in the bar
saying Peeler left at 4:30.

41:17.766 --> 41:20.186
So, Peeler was caught in a lie.

41:20.603 --> 41:25.649
But... I was... I was never really
comfortable that it was a lie.

41:25.733 --> 41:29.153
’Cause, you know, he...
he ballparked it. But it stuck.

41:29.945 --> 41:34.533
(SIGHS) See, I... I was new then
and I’d just gotten my shield.

41:34.617 --> 41:38.287
This was the first homicide I’d worked,
and Joe, he was... he was a legend.

41:38.370 --> 41:42.708
I was told, "Just lay back and learn."
So I did, but...

41:42.958 --> 41:44.710
(SIGHS) I don’t know.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.713
(SCOFFS) My hands are shaking here.

41:49.507 --> 41:53.427
-A jury convicted this guy, Andy.
-He didn’t do it, though.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.472
He didn’t do the crime.
That’s what I’m trying to tell you.

41:56.847 --> 42:00.059
It’s not your fault. Take it from me,
I’m on the outside looking at this,

42:00.142 --> 42:02.186
and it is not your fault, not even close.

42:02.311 --> 42:05.314
I appreciate that.
Listen, uh, thanks for coming by.

42:05.564 --> 42:08.150
-JOHN: Where are you going?
-I’m gonna take a walk.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.401
You don’t want me
to come along with you?

42:09.485 --> 42:11.487
-No, I’m good.
-I don’t have to worry about you, right?

42:11.654 --> 42:14.907
I’m fine. Go home,
I’ll see you tomorrow.
