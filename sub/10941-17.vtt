00:00.603 --> 00:01.869
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.937 --> 00:03.871
Even before I met your mom,

00:03.939 --> 00:07.242
I saw her at this
colt starting competition.

00:07.309 --> 00:09.143
She used to take me
when I was little.

00:09.211 --> 00:11.713
They give three days
to gentle an unbroke horse.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.718
The rodeo club tryouts
start tomorrow

00:17.785 --> 00:20.554
and Rachel and all her friends
are really into pole-bending.

00:20.622 --> 00:22.489
And all the girls you wanna
get in with are trying out.

00:22.557 --> 00:24.625
No, all the girls
you wanna get in with.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.825
My truck!

00:25.893 --> 00:27.527
How'd you get it back
from the repo man?

00:27.595 --> 00:28.862
All it took was some money.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.263
You and Jake
barely talk any more

00:30.330 --> 00:32.197
and he still
lets you ride his horse?

00:32.266 --> 00:33.098
Jake's like a little puppy,

00:33.166 --> 00:34.267
he'll do anything for me.

00:34.334 --> 00:35.568
You know you should
put the poor guy

00:35.636 --> 00:36.835
out of his own misery.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.037
Nobody's stopping him
from moving on.

00:41.742 --> 00:46.010
All right, so you gotta
keep your eye on the prize.

00:46.078 --> 00:47.812
- Ohhh!
- Geez. That was so close!

00:47.880 --> 00:49.514
<i>Or so far.</i>

00:49.582 --> 00:50.682
Here, it's my turn.

00:50.750 --> 00:51.816
No, no. Ty, Ty, Ty!

00:51.884 --> 00:53.485
<i>Come on, I wanna try it again.</i>

00:53.552 --> 00:54.852
Ty!

00:58.023 --> 00:58.923
Ugh!

01:05.330 --> 01:06.330
Victor!

01:06.398 --> 01:07.798
Nice throw!

01:07.865 --> 01:10.366
Hi, Ty. Tansi, my girl.

01:11.135 --> 01:13.270
<i>Nice looking colt
you have here.</i>

01:13.338 --> 01:15.205
Thanks, Ty and I just started
working with him.

01:15.273 --> 01:17.307
Well, I hope you know more
about starting colts

01:17.374 --> 01:19.208
than you do about roping them.

01:21.445 --> 01:23.780
You heard about this
Ring of Fire competition?

01:23.847 --> 01:25.448
Yeah, the posters are up
all over town.

01:25.516 --> 01:27.684
I can't wait to see you work.

01:27.751 --> 01:30.119
<i>Well, you're gonna have to wait
a little longer.</i>

01:30.187 --> 01:32.422
<i>Scheduling conflict.</i>

01:33.356 --> 01:35.324
The Phoenix Invitational.

01:35.391 --> 01:38.059
But I gave the Ring of Fire
guys your name.

01:38.127 --> 01:39.628
What?

01:39.696 --> 01:41.863
Me filling in for you.
Are you serious?

01:41.931 --> 01:43.298
Serious about what?

01:43.366 --> 01:45.099
I want your sister
to take my place

01:45.167 --> 01:47.035
at the Horse Palace
next weekend.

01:47.102 --> 01:48.236
Really?

01:53.342 --> 01:55.943
My old friend Pegasus.

01:56.010 --> 01:58.746
Marion and I learned
a lot from him.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.881
You know,
your mom introduced me

02:00.949 --> 02:03.517
to these colt starting
contests.

02:03.585 --> 02:06.553
Helped me see
beyond my own world.

02:07.488 --> 02:10.223
Victor, I really appreciate you

02:10.289 --> 02:12.759
entering me in that contest,
but I don't know,

02:12.827 --> 02:15.027
I've just never done
anything like that before.

02:15.095 --> 02:17.797
Well, you've worked
with a lot of colts.

02:17.865 --> 02:19.366
Yeah. But...

02:19.433 --> 02:21.667
I've never given a clinic,
or even been in a competition.

02:21.735 --> 02:24.169
There's always a first time,
my girl.

02:24.237 --> 02:26.538
And you were in the news
a lot this year.

02:26.606 --> 02:28.907
Yeah, the Miracle Girl video.

02:28.975 --> 02:31.276
<i>That was great for awhile.
But...</i>

02:31.344 --> 02:34.112
The buzz has kinda
died down a bit.

02:34.180 --> 02:37.782
Maybe you need some
new buzz around here?

02:37.850 --> 02:39.617
Yeah. Since the quarantine?

02:39.685 --> 02:42.854
<i>We could use something.</i>

02:42.921 --> 02:44.255
This is the guy.

02:44.322 --> 02:46.323
He's waiting for your call.

02:49.528 --> 02:52.162
So each trainer's given
three one hour sessions

02:52.230 --> 02:53.764
spread over three days,

02:53.831 --> 02:56.299
in front of a... judges
and an audience.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.768
Three days?

02:57.835 --> 02:59.269
We've been working with
this guy for almost a week,

02:59.336 --> 03:00.970
and we just got the saddle
on him now.

03:01.038 --> 03:02.739
Yeah, well...

03:02.807 --> 03:04.441
This isn't a competition.

03:04.509 --> 03:06.476
Yeah, well maybe
we're going to slow.

03:06.544 --> 03:08.612
I mean, if guys like Victor
can do it in three hours,

03:08.679 --> 03:10.013
why can't we, right?

03:10.080 --> 03:10.980
Do you remember what happened
with Harley?

03:11.048 --> 03:12.081
Did you forget?

03:12.149 --> 03:13.883
No. But that was me.

03:14.818 --> 03:17.787
Come on, I had no clue
what I was doing, Amy.

03:17.854 --> 03:19.655
<i>Come on, give it a shot.</i>

03:19.723 --> 03:21.925
What's the worst
that could happen?

03:21.992 --> 03:24.093
<i>Just give it a try.</i>

03:24.161 --> 03:25.228
Okay.

03:26.829 --> 03:28.163
Good boy.

03:29.232 --> 03:30.365
<i>Whoa...</i>

03:30.800 --> 03:31.934
<i>Whoa...</i>

03:33.169 --> 03:34.502
Good boy.

03:35.504 --> 03:36.838
Whoa, good boy.

03:38.074 --> 03:39.308
So far so good.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.909
<i>- Yeah.
- See?</i>

03:42.377 --> 03:43.777
Good boy.

03:43.778 --> 03:45.712
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy!

03:49.084 --> 03:52.019
Whoa! Easy! Easy, easy!

03:52.087 --> 03:53.154
Ungh!

03:53.555 --> 03:54.288

04:42.901 --> 04:44.302
Okay, I don't know
about you guys,

04:44.370 --> 04:45.536
but I want a buckle.

04:45.604 --> 04:46.870
So, I think we should
rent the arena out

04:46.937 --> 04:49.006
for Saturday morning.

04:49.073 --> 04:50.307
Um, yeah, sure, Mallory.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.541
But, uh...

04:51.609 --> 04:52.442
There's this mall opening
in Calgary,

04:52.510 --> 04:53.843
and we were planning to go,

04:53.911 --> 04:55.912
my cousin said we could stay
at her house.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.280
That sounds great!

04:57.348 --> 05:00.617
Well, that's the thing.
My mom said no.

05:00.684 --> 05:04.286
Well, I could get my mom
to talk to your mom?

05:04.354 --> 05:07.189
Well, it's just kind
of complicated because...

05:07.257 --> 05:08.891
We were hoping
you could cover for us,

05:08.958 --> 05:10.059
so we could tell
Jamie's parents

05:10.127 --> 05:11.560
we were staying at your place.

05:11.628 --> 05:12.995
And give them your cell number,

05:13.063 --> 05:14.796
so in case they wanted
to call...

05:14.864 --> 05:16.798
And what am I'm supposed
to say, you're busy?

05:16.866 --> 05:19.967
Busy going to Calgary
without me?

05:20.036 --> 05:22.170
Maybe I'm busy too.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.274
Check it out, huh.

05:26.342 --> 05:27.708
At this rate,
I'll be benching 200 pounds

05:27.776 --> 05:28.976
in a couple of weeks.

05:29.045 --> 05:30.878
Great! Then maybe
you can carry this one too?

05:30.946 --> 05:32.313
Yeah.

05:32.381 --> 05:34.614
Yeah, once I get my upper body
strength back,

05:34.682 --> 05:36.316
gonna ease back
into the timed events.

05:36.384 --> 05:38.452
Aren't you forgetting
something?

05:38.520 --> 05:40.020
No, I'm thinking
that's everything.

05:40.088 --> 05:41.755
No, it's not.

05:41.822 --> 05:44.191
I got your truck back,
I helped you move

05:44.259 --> 05:45.392
and you still haven't
apologized

05:45.460 --> 05:47.528
for the way
that you treated me!

05:47.595 --> 05:48.862
Come on, Ash.

05:48.930 --> 05:50.863
You know that wasn't me.

05:50.931 --> 05:53.632
It was the accident, pills,

05:53.700 --> 05:56.269
okay, maybe my personal hygiene
left a little to be desired.

05:56.336 --> 05:58.003
And you forgot the drinking.

05:58.072 --> 05:59.072
Okay, that's the past.

05:59.139 --> 06:00.573
I gotta look to the future now.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.875
Get back in shape,
and get on the rodeo circuit.

06:02.943 --> 06:04.810
So where does that leave us?

06:04.878 --> 06:06.978
Same place we were before
all this stuff happened.

06:07.046 --> 06:10.048
And what was that? Remind me?

06:12.485 --> 06:14.719
See, that's what
I'm talking about, baby!

06:18.157 --> 06:20.959
You know, bookings at the dude
ranch are way down.

06:21.026 --> 06:22.159
This Ring of Fire thing?

06:22.227 --> 06:24.061
This is a big deal,
free publicity,

06:24.129 --> 06:25.596
<i>it's gonna be good
for all of us.</i>

06:25.663 --> 06:27.831
And it would be
a good experience.

06:27.899 --> 06:29.433
I mean, come on, Amy,
it looks like fun.

06:29.501 --> 06:31.302
Yeah, 'cause screwing up
in front of hundreds of people

06:31.369 --> 06:32.536
sounds like fun?

06:32.604 --> 06:35.106
I'm with Amy.
Three days to gentle a colt?

06:35.173 --> 06:37.674
That is not the horse business.
That is show business.

06:37.742 --> 06:39.709
No, Jack. It's just business.

06:39.776 --> 06:41.144
<i>Dad's right.</i>

06:41.212 --> 06:43.613
You know, this equine market
is exploding -

06:43.680 --> 06:45.648
equi-fairs selling
equi-products

06:45.716 --> 06:47.083
and equi-services.

06:47.151 --> 06:48.918
Okay, Lou, but I have to feel
good about this

06:48.986 --> 06:51.354
in order to do it
and right now I don't.

06:51.422 --> 06:52.755
But, Amy, you're gonna end up
doing this sort of thing

06:52.823 --> 06:53.856
sooner or later.

06:53.924 --> 06:55.224
And this is almost perfect
for ya.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.658
That's right.

06:56.726 --> 06:58.327
Hometown crowd.
Lots of support.

06:58.394 --> 07:00.795
Your friends and your family
cheering you on.

07:00.863 --> 07:02.464
And you're better looking
than the guys that do it.

07:02.532 --> 07:03.698
<i>All I'm saying is,</i>

07:03.766 --> 07:06.067
we can't keep thinking
about this like the family farm.

07:06.136 --> 07:08.670
You know, last time I checked,

07:08.738 --> 07:13.641
this being a family farm
wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

07:13.708 --> 07:16.444
Great, no pressure at all.

07:21.150 --> 07:22.416
Hey.

07:23.485 --> 07:27.287
Look, obviously
this is your decision, okay.

07:27.355 --> 07:28.588
I guess I was a little...

07:28.656 --> 07:31.391
Yeah, I know.
Even more so than usual.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.993
Lou, what is going on?

07:34.061 --> 07:35.428
Nothing.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.130
- Are you sure? 'Cause you've been a bit-
- Well, how would you feel

07:37.198 --> 07:39.299
if you were spending
your anniversary alone?

07:39.367 --> 07:40.333
Anniversary for what?

07:40.401 --> 07:41.401
Me and Peter!

07:41.469 --> 07:43.001
It's our one year anniversary!

07:43.069 --> 07:44.770
Wow. It just...

07:45.705 --> 07:46.972
Seems like it hasn't
been that long.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.775
Yeah, because we never
spend any time together!

07:49.842 --> 07:51.743
I mean, it's my one year
anniversary this weekend!

07:51.811 --> 07:53.612
And who am I spending it with?

07:53.680 --> 07:55.747
A bunch of horses!

07:56.650 --> 07:57.716
Yeah.

08:02.388 --> 08:03.454
<i>Hey.</i>

08:03.522 --> 08:04.922
Where're you taking Shorty?

08:04.990 --> 08:05.990
Well, back home.

08:06.058 --> 08:08.193
Aw, I'm sorry.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.662
But I seriously gotta work
on my roping.

08:10.729 --> 08:12.697
What about pole bending?
I don't have a horse.

08:12.764 --> 08:15.065
Hey, no worries, sweetheart.

08:15.132 --> 08:16.366
You're in the rodeo club now.

08:16.434 --> 08:18.101
One of your friends
will lend you a horse.

08:18.169 --> 08:19.469
Yeah. I guess.

08:21.639 --> 08:23.207
Well, I probably
could've gotten Rachel

08:23.274 --> 08:24.341
to let you borrow a horse,

08:24.409 --> 08:25.975
but she's mad at me now.

08:26.043 --> 08:27.977
Why? Because of me?

08:28.045 --> 08:29.646
I promised her
you'd cover for us!

08:29.714 --> 08:32.248
Before you even asking me?

08:32.316 --> 08:34.783
Look.
Rachel has lots of friends.

08:34.851 --> 08:37.453
I'm new.
And I'm easily replaced.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.388
You mean, because I wouldn't
lie for you?

08:39.456 --> 08:41.924
Aw come on, Mallory!

08:41.991 --> 08:43.826
Okay, you guys are just
gonna ditch me anyway!

08:43.893 --> 08:45.561
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

08:45.629 --> 08:47.862
We were going to ask you
to come!

08:47.930 --> 08:51.065
Just... Next time, for sure.

08:51.133 --> 08:53.201
<i>I promise. Please?</i>

08:56.138 --> 08:58.740
Good morning, Soraya, can I get
a cup of coffee, please?

08:58.807 --> 09:00.041
Yeah, sure.

09:00.109 --> 09:02.476
Might as well get a refill
for my buddy Jack.

09:02.544 --> 09:04.077
Refills are free, Mr. Fleming.

09:04.145 --> 09:05.145
Oh that's right.

09:05.213 --> 09:06.213
If you're feeling generous,

09:06.281 --> 09:08.482
I wouldn't mind a piece of pie.

09:08.550 --> 09:11.885
You forgot to mention
you had a pretty big payday

09:11.953 --> 09:13.086
at the track...

09:13.154 --> 09:14.654
Lightning Dexter by a nose.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.857
Anyway, you should be buying
your own pie.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.125
This Ring of Fire thing,

09:18.192 --> 09:20.593
it's gonna be a game changer
for all of us,

09:20.661 --> 09:21.394
not just Amy.

09:21.462 --> 09:23.196
Now hold on.

09:23.264 --> 09:25.165
She still hasn't decided.

09:25.233 --> 09:27.433
And I'm still not sure
it's the right thing for her.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.468
How come you didn't squawk
when Marion did it?

09:29.535 --> 09:32.972
'Cause it was different then.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.706
Before it got all
commercialized.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.075
Now it's all about the money.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.278
Well some people think
that's a good thing, Jack.

09:41.014 --> 09:41.781
What else you wanna talk about?

09:41.848 --> 09:43.548
Nothing.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.616
You know, there's about a
thousand reasons why horses buck.

09:45.684 --> 09:48.787
And Mom seems to know how
to handle every one of them.

09:48.854 --> 09:49.854
Yeah, look at this.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.656
Wrong saddle. Sore back.

09:51.723 --> 09:53.158
Cinch strap too tight.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.525
Heh. Barking dog.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.928
Ty. I think this might it.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.630
"Whatever you teach
the horse from the right side,

09:59.698 --> 10:03.500
you have to teach
from the left as well."

10:07.571 --> 10:10.140
Make sure he's looking at you.

10:12.743 --> 10:14.511
Whoa...

10:14.578 --> 10:15.845
Good boy.

10:15.913 --> 10:17.613
Hey. Good.

10:18.916 --> 10:20.783
Okay, we might as well
try it from the other side.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.854
Mm-hm.

10:24.922 --> 10:26.655
See what he's doing?

10:29.359 --> 10:30.927
I'd say he's pretty chill.

10:30.994 --> 10:33.795
Yeah, at least one of us is.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.131
Ooh...

10:36.199 --> 10:37.199
Hey.

10:37.266 --> 10:38.499
You took the fall last time.

10:38.567 --> 10:41.002
It's my turn, okay.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.337
Ty, if I can't do this here,

10:42.404 --> 10:44.272
I don't know why I'd even
be thinking about...

10:44.340 --> 10:46.474
So you are thinking about it?

10:46.542 --> 10:47.775
The Ring of Fire?

10:47.843 --> 10:49.509
I don't know.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.984
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

10:57.052 --> 10:57.985
Hey.

10:58.053 --> 10:59.186
Okay.

10:59.254 --> 11:00.787
It's one thing for you
to get on a colt

11:00.856 --> 11:02.223
<i>in the round pen of our yard.</i>

11:02.290 --> 11:04.557

in some big competition.

11:12.299 --> 11:15.368
I got something to show you.

11:19.506 --> 11:22.607
I came here on calls
a couple of times with Scott.

11:22.675 --> 11:25.344
That's when he showed it to me.

11:31.017 --> 11:32.117
Marion Fleming,

1995 winner,

11:38.123 --> 11:39.556

11:39.624 --> 11:42.693
She does look like
she can fly, huh?

11:42.761 --> 11:43.995
Yeah.

but...

14:39.050 --> 14:40.484
But you didn't.

14:40.552 --> 14:41.785
Is that what you meant when
you said you wanted things

14:41.853 --> 14:43.888

they were?

14:43.955 --> 14:46.156

14:58.502 --> 15:00.169

15:21.424 --> 15:22.524

15:22.591 --> 15:24.091
Besides a huge cell phone bill?

15:24.159 --> 15:25.459

very well,

15:33.133 --> 15:34.500

<i>the second he stepped
into the ring,</i>

15:36.170 --> 15:39.238
and this old cowboy,
he's not wasting any time.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.007
<i>Three days, three colts.</i>

15:41.075 --> 15:42.508
Saddle an unbroke horse.

15:42.577 --> 15:45.879

an obstacle course.

15:45.947 --> 15:47.479
Our outstanding panel of judges

15:47.547 --> 15:49.347

of different elements

15:49.415 --> 15:50.950

15:51.017 --> 15:53.218
<i>and even they don't know
who the winner's gonna be</i>

15:53.286 --> 15:56.088
<i>until those points
are all tallied up.</i>

15:56.155 --> 15:57.456
Well, folks, I, uh...

15:57.523 --> 16:00.793
Hope you aint' expecting
nothing fancy here today.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.861
'Cause, uh, I'm just
an old fashioned cowboy

16:03.929 --> 16:06.598
and I ain't about
to change my ways.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.102
<i>These colts, of course, have
had minimal human contact.</i>

16:11.169 --> 16:13.838
<i>They will be seeing a saddle
for the very fist time.</i>

16:13.906 --> 16:16.774
<i>And the first saddling
often is kinda crucial</i>

16:16.842 --> 16:18.375
<i>as far as the rest
of the development</i>

16:18.443 --> 16:20.110
<i>of the horse goes.</i>

16:20.177 --> 16:21.678
He's pretty good...

16:21.746 --> 16:23.179
He's too good.

16:23.247 --> 16:25.015
And fast.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.416
Too fast.

16:29.253 --> 16:31.354
- Dad, wha-
- Excuse me.

16:31.422 --> 16:34.057
<i>Just watch while Garret workswith the horse.</i>

16:34.125 --> 16:36.258
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

16:36.326 --> 16:38.027
<i>Well, he's got a kind eye,</i>

16:38.095 --> 16:40.062
but I've gotta make sure I don't
give him any mixed signals.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.897
You see the way his ears go?

16:41.965 --> 16:43.133
Yeah.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.667
It means he's energetic
and a little hot.

16:44.735 --> 16:46.068
Hey!

16:47.004 --> 16:48.104
Dad!

16:48.171 --> 16:49.672
What're you doing back here?

16:49.740 --> 16:52.674
I'm just trying to get a read
on the colt I've drawn.

16:52.742 --> 16:54.776
Well, you should be out there
watching what that old cowboy.

16:54.844 --> 16:56.377
Dad, come on.

16:56.445 --> 16:57.478
Listen, I've seen a
million of these things.

16:57.546 --> 16:58.880
'Kay, it's not the horse,
it's the time.

16:58.948 --> 16:59.981
And you're wasting yours.

17:00.049 --> 17:01.116
How're you doing, Ty?

17:01.183 --> 17:02.751
Tim.

17:02.818 --> 17:04.752
<i>Tell us what your doing,
Garret.</i>

17:04.819 --> 17:06.253
<i>Well, you know,</i>

17:06.320 --> 17:07.721
I'm probably pushing things
here a little today,

17:07.789 --> 17:10.991
but, aw shucks, that's the way
I've always done it.

17:11.059 --> 17:12.992
And you know...

17:13.060 --> 17:14.694
You gotta stick with
what you do,

17:14.762 --> 17:17.865
because what you done
got you to where you're at.

17:17.932 --> 17:19.767
I like him.

17:19.834 --> 17:22.435
You know, a lot of times
when I was a kid

17:22.502 --> 17:25.805
we didn't have all day
to go get the cows,

17:25.873 --> 17:27.606
so we had to kinda
do things in a hurry

17:27.675 --> 17:31.678
and I guess that's where
I kinda learned my ways.

17:31.745 --> 17:34.981
Sometimes it works,
sometimes it don't.

17:35.916 --> 17:37.449
<i>Some people will take a week</i>

17:37.517 --> 17:40.351
<i>to get a saddle on a horse
for the first time.</i>

17:40.419 --> 17:42.220
<i>Garret's not gonna take
that kinda time.</i>

17:42.288 --> 17:44.189
<i>He just going right
after him here.</i>

17:44.256 --> 17:48.259
<i>Sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.</i>

17:51.731 --> 17:54.765
Lou?
How long has he been in there?

17:54.833 --> 17:55.900
15 minutes.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.803
But it was a long 15 minutes.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.873
Yeah, and I'm going to hate you
for a long time.

18:02.941 --> 18:05.509
You just never know...

18:06.745 --> 18:08.579
What's gonna happen.

18:08.646 --> 18:10.114
Well, shoot...

18:10.182 --> 18:13.817
Well, it looks like
it might be my lucky day.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.585
There's no fireworks here yet.

18:15.652 --> 18:17.187
Whoa, easy, whoa!

18:22.459 --> 18:24.427
Looks like this horse
is starting to get used to me.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.462
<i>Garret has saddled
and ridden his horse</i>

18:27.530 --> 18:28.931
<i>in the first session.</i>

18:28.998 --> 18:31.900
<i>He set that bar pretty high.</i>

18:32.902 --> 18:34.903
Tell Amy I threw in
some onion rings for good luck.

18:34.971 --> 18:36.371
Thanks, Soraya.

18:37.707 --> 18:39.641
Hi, Mrs. Baker.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.110
Uh, no sorry.

18:41.177 --> 18:42.910
Jamie's actually
in the shower right now.

18:42.978 --> 18:45.012
Hey, Mallory, how's it going?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.014
No, there's no boys here.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.984
He's just a family friend
and he's leaving.

18:50.052 --> 18:51.853
Yeah, totally, call anytime,

18:51.920 --> 18:54.222
you're not interrupting
anything.

18:54.289 --> 18:55.356
Okay, bye.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.025
Sorry, that was...

19:04.298 --> 19:07.167
<i>Two-minute warning, Chase.
Two minutes left.</i>

19:07.235 --> 19:08.401
Now folks, you might think

19:08.469 --> 19:10.737
my methods are a bit
unorthodox...

19:10.805 --> 19:12.806
I think I'm just gonna spend the
rest of my time here relaxing

19:12.874 --> 19:14.874
after an honest day's work.

19:14.941 --> 19:17.509
Anybody got a beer?

19:17.577 --> 19:19.578
<i>If that horse
can take Chase's weight,</i>

19:19.646 --> 19:22.581
<i>the saddle should
be no problem.</i>

19:26.253 --> 19:27.552
Look, uh...

19:27.620 --> 19:29.021
I know this is your first time,

19:29.089 --> 19:32.323
and, uh... sorry
if I'm a tough act to follow.

19:32.391 --> 19:33.491
But maybe you should've
thought of that

19:33.558 --> 19:34.659
before you signed up?

19:34.726 --> 19:36.294
<i>Chase.</i>

19:36.361 --> 19:38.396
Cut her some slack.

19:38.463 --> 19:42.133
Just helping out
the new kid, Garret.

19:44.703 --> 19:46.370
Don't worry about that guy.

19:46.438 --> 19:48.571
Just think about
what you gotta do.

19:48.639 --> 19:50.007
You'll be just fine, okay?

19:50.074 --> 19:51.008
Okay.

19:51.075 --> 19:52.475
Perfect.

19:53.144 --> 19:56.246
Well, Amy is not the first
woman we've had out here,

19:56.314 --> 19:58.315
her mother took that honour,
several years ago

19:58.382 --> 20:00.117
as many of you might remember.

20:00.185 --> 20:03.286
<i>She is however the youngest
trainer we've ever had.</i>

20:03.353 --> 20:04.687
But don't let that fool you,

20:04.754 --> 20:06.923
she's a real contender.

20:06.990 --> 20:08.424
<i>Amy. Could you tell us
just a little bit</i>

20:08.491 --> 20:10.492
about what it is you're doing?

20:10.560 --> 20:12.695
Well, horses are naturally
curious animals.

20:12.762 --> 20:14.263
<i>So, I chase him around a bit,</i>

20:14.331 --> 20:16.165
<i>and now I'm hoping
he'll follow me.</i>

20:16.233 --> 20:17.666
Yeah well,
she better hurry it up.

20:17.734 --> 20:19.100
Dad!

20:19.168 --> 20:20.568
Whoa, whoa.

20:21.770 --> 20:23.972
Whoa.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.540
Good boy.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.811
<i>And there he goes.</i>

20:32.781 --> 20:34.082
Not sure if he's
ready for this yet,

20:34.150 --> 20:35.316
but we'll give it a go.

20:42.690 --> 20:45.092
<i>Amy, you've spent a lot of time
on ground work,</i>

20:45.160 --> 20:46.994
<i>hope it pays off.</i>

20:47.062 --> 20:48.195
What's this?

20:49.130 --> 20:50.430
<i>Good boy.</i>

20:53.667 --> 20:55.801
Amy; Hm, what's that?

20:55.870 --> 20:58.204
<i>Good boy, what's that, huh?</i>

21:12.685 --> 21:14.987
Well, maybe I, uh...

21:15.054 --> 21:16.554
I rushed things a little...

21:16.622 --> 21:20.859
Amy, I hate to tell you this,
but your time is up.

21:22.262 --> 21:24.028
All right, well, um...

21:24.096 --> 21:25.662
You know, I like to leave
things on a good note,

21:25.730 --> 21:28.332
but I guess we'll have
to deal with what we got.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.401
On the bright side I made
a little bit of progress,

21:30.468 --> 21:31.702
and, uh...

21:31.770 --> 21:32.770
And I found out
a good name for him

21:32.837 --> 21:34.071
when he started bucking
there...

21:34.139 --> 21:35.706
I think I'm gonna call him
Crackerjack.

21:45.316 --> 21:46.749
That was really good.

21:46.817 --> 21:48.118
You could see at the end
he was starting to trusted you.

21:48.185 --> 21:51.221
Ty, I want to go home.
Take me home, okay.

21:55.828 --> 21:57.729
Hey.

21:57.797 --> 21:58.997
Hey.

22:00.633 --> 22:01.500
What's up?

22:01.567 --> 22:03.568
I don't know what to do.

22:03.636 --> 22:05.003
You know...

22:05.070 --> 22:07.205
I just feel like
I'm outta my league.

22:07.272 --> 22:09.039
<i>I tried to speed things up
like those other guys,</i>

22:09.107 --> 22:11.208
and it just... it fell apart.

22:11.275 --> 22:13.243
And... my mind went blank.

22:13.311 --> 22:15.245
I don't--
Tomorrow?

22:15.313 --> 22:20.317
Well, you're not thinking
about quitting are you?

22:20.385 --> 22:22.920
It just isn't working out.

22:22.988 --> 22:26.723
I did this
because Mom did this,

22:26.790 --> 22:30.560
and...

22:30.628 --> 22:32.595
I thought it would be
different.

22:32.663 --> 22:36.165
You know, Garret,
he's way ahead,

22:36.233 --> 22:38.167
and that Chase guy,
he hates me.

22:38.235 --> 22:39.636
Come on, Amy.

22:40.504 --> 22:43.271
It's about you and that colt
in the round pen,

22:43.339 --> 22:45.473
and you've done that
a million times.

22:45.542 --> 22:47.609
I know, it's just...
I keep thinking

22:47.677 --> 22:49.344
like I have to switch it up
or something.

22:49.412 --> 22:51.947
No, don't even go there,

22:52.015 --> 22:53.114
okay?

22:54.116 --> 22:57.351
It's like... like Garret said:

22:57.419 --> 22:58.986
"You gotta stick to what you do

22:59.054 --> 23:00.454
because what you've done..."

23:00.522 --> 23:02.355
"Has got you
to where you're at."

23:04.759 --> 23:05.992
I know.

23:09.665 --> 23:11.432
<i>It's only the start
of day two</i>

23:11.499 --> 23:14.668
<i>and Garret has already
taken his horse a long way.</i>

23:14.735 --> 23:17.270
Well, look at that,
no fireworks.

23:17.337 --> 23:20.440
You know, I'll take that
any day.

23:20.507 --> 23:21.841
<i>Garret, the problem is,</i>

23:21.909 --> 23:24.377
<i>you're making this look
way too easy.</i>

23:24.445 --> 23:25.679
You know, folks,

23:25.746 --> 23:27.547
this might make
a pretty nice rope horse.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.715
Garret, haven't you won
enough of these things already?

23:31.618 --> 23:32.985
<i>Garret McDuff,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

23:33.053 --> 23:34.687
<i>We'll take a brief
intermission.</i>

23:36.189 --> 23:38.624
Jake, what happened to you
yesterday?

23:38.692 --> 23:39.892
Nothing.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.961
I just figured you were
talking to that guy.

23:42.028 --> 23:43.896
Badger? No, I wasn't.

23:46.198 --> 23:48.299
You gotta be kidding.

23:48.366 --> 23:50.802
Maybe you should answer
the darn phone.

23:50.869 --> 23:52.870
Fine, I will.

23:54.807 --> 23:56.307
Hey, Badger.

23:59.377 --> 24:01.177
Chase is halfway through
his second session

24:01.245 --> 24:02.479
and the colt's saddled,

24:02.546 --> 24:04.748
but if a horse is gonna
be safe to ride,

24:04.816 --> 24:07.084
<i>he's gonna be exposed
to a lot of scary objects</i>

24:07.151 --> 24:08.719
<i>through his lifetime.</i>

24:08.786 --> 24:10.120
It looks to me
like Chase Powers

24:10.187 --> 24:12.656
is trying to expose this colt
to some things

24:12.724 --> 24:14.290
that might scare him.

24:16.594 --> 24:18.293
<i>What're you gonna do
about that, huh?</i>

24:18.361 --> 24:19.261
What're you gonna do
about that?

24:25.869 --> 24:27.236
<i>Under a minute left, Chase.</i>

24:27.303 --> 24:28.804
<i>Now what're you doing?</i>

24:30.306 --> 24:32.974
All right,
don't worry, folks,

24:33.042 --> 24:34.809
took the chain off.

24:34.877 --> 24:36.745
Basic idea is the same.

24:36.812 --> 24:38.747
You wanna scare him
all you can now...

24:40.482 --> 24:43.084
So that he's not scared later,

24:43.152 --> 24:44.719
when your wife's riding him
down the road.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.420
What's he trying to prove?

24:46.488 --> 24:47.789
I don't know. But...

24:47.857 --> 24:49.690
Feel sorry for whoever
gets that colt next.

24:52.661 --> 24:54.928
Where's Amy going?
I gotta talk to her.

24:54.996 --> 24:56.396
Grampa, go after him.

24:56.464 --> 24:57.531
Yeah, yeah.

25:03.437 --> 25:04.771
Chase Powers! Wooo!

25:05.906 --> 25:07.406
<i>Hate to say it, Chase,</i>

25:07.474 --> 25:09.642
<i>but that clock
has run out of gas.</i>

25:09.710 --> 25:11.277
Tim, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

25:11.344 --> 25:13.312
I want my daughter
to win this thing.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.814
Can't you just leave her be?

25:14.882 --> 25:17.283
Why is her winning
so important to you?

25:17.350 --> 25:18.685
Jack,

25:18.752 --> 25:20.719
you know I have my girls'
best interest at heart.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.020
But I have dreams, too,

25:22.088 --> 25:24.089
and right now my dream
is sitting in a stall,

25:24.157 --> 25:25.490
every day,

25:25.558 --> 25:27.458
taking it one step closer
to its best before date.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.661
What are you going on
about now?

25:29.729 --> 25:31.029
California.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.297
There's a dozen tracks
down there

25:32.364 --> 25:34.032
I can make a fortune
at this winter.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.168
I got a very limited
window of opportunity.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.102
California... that's good.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.136
You're hoping she wins

25:39.204 --> 25:40.738
so you can ease your conscience

25:40.806 --> 25:42.606
about leaving her again?

25:51.983 --> 25:53.016
Peter!

25:53.084 --> 25:54.417
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

25:54.484 --> 25:56.586
Hey! Where are you?

25:56.653 --> 25:58.421
Are you still in Dubai?

25:58.488 --> 25:59.455
<i>Yeah, I just thought
i'd give you a call</i>

25:59.523 --> 26:01.891
<i>and say happy anniversary.</i>

26:01.959 --> 26:04.427
Yeah, happy
anniversary to you, too.

26:04.494 --> 26:07.931
<i>Hey, did you get the roses I sent?</i>

26:07.998 --> 26:10.298
You sent roses to here?
To the arena?

26:10.366 --> 26:12.101
<i>Yeah! What, you don't see them?</i>

26:12.168 --> 26:13.702
<i>They should be there right now.</i>

26:13.770 --> 26:16.105
No, I don't...
Baby, I don't see anything.

26:16.172 --> 26:17.740
<i>Are you sure?</i>

26:17.807 --> 26:21.176
<i>'Cause you might just be
looking the wrong way, Lou.</i>

26:22.378 --> 26:23.578
Oh my God.

26:23.646 --> 26:25.813
Excuse me. Can I... sorry.

26:25.881 --> 26:27.615
I'm-I'm so sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.

26:27.682 --> 26:29.416
Thank you. Baby! Oh!

26:30.185 --> 26:31.285
Oh, you're crushing the roses.

26:31.353 --> 26:33.154
Who cares about the roses?!

26:33.222 --> 26:35.089
I can't believe you're here!

26:35.157 --> 26:36.157
I know. It's just actually
the thorn's actually in my hand.

26:36.225 --> 26:38.325
Oh! Oh! Sorry! Sorry. You okay?

26:38.393 --> 26:39.460
Yeah. Sorry.

26:39.527 --> 26:40.661
I can't believe you're here.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.562
I know. I haven't slept
for 36 hours,

26:42.630 --> 26:43.830
I don't know
what time zone I'm in,

26:43.898 --> 26:46.532
but I hope I got the right day.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.269
You did. You got it right.

26:50.204 --> 26:52.405
Awww...

26:52.473 --> 26:53.573
Baby.

26:54.642 --> 26:57.442
Awww...

26:57.510 --> 26:59.245
My mother always said
that you gotta teach

26:59.312 --> 27:01.380
from both sides of the horse:

27:01.447 --> 27:03.883
<i>The thinking side
and the reaction side.</i>

27:03.950 --> 27:05.151
Well, Amy, it looked
like yesterday

27:05.218 --> 27:06.418
you were losing ground,

27:06.486 --> 27:07.987
but whatever you've done
since then,

27:08.054 --> 27:10.189
<i>it looks like now you've got
Crackerjack's attention</i>

27:10.257 --> 27:11.223
<i>right where it belongs,</i>

27:11.291 --> 27:12.324
<i>and that's on you.</i>

27:12.392 --> 27:13.792
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:13.859 --> 27:18.062
Let's just hope he's using
his thinking side today.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.197
Whoa.

27:19.932 --> 27:20.999
Whoa.

27:22.367 --> 27:23.935
That's a good boy.

27:28.740 --> 27:29.807
Good boy.

27:39.284 --> 27:40.884
Good boy.

27:42.553 --> 27:43.854
Awww...

27:44.789 --> 27:47.589
Yes! Yes, she's done
like dinner!

27:51.195 --> 27:53.462
Oh man, it looked so promising,

27:53.530 --> 27:57.099
<i>but I guess
there's always tomorrow.</i>

28:05.808 --> 28:07.375
Ready to go?

28:08.510 --> 28:10.879
No, um...
You should go.

28:10.947 --> 28:12.113
I'm gonna stay with this guy

28:12.181 --> 28:14.649
and see if I'm missing
something.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.352
You need any help?

28:17.419 --> 28:18.720
No.

28:18.787 --> 28:22.256
This is something
I should do on my own.

28:23.191 --> 28:24.091
Thanks.

28:24.159 --> 28:25.226
Okay.

28:36.904 --> 28:38.104
He wants you
to be his girlfriend,

28:38.172 --> 28:39.473
but he won't tell you
what that means?

28:39.540 --> 28:40.940
He can't.

28:41.008 --> 28:42.409
I mean, it's no wonder
he's in 8-second events;

28:42.477 --> 28:44.143
That's as long as he can
think about anything.

28:45.980 --> 28:48.281
I, uh, hope you're still
open for business.

28:48.349 --> 28:50.282
People tell me this is
the best place in town.

28:50.350 --> 28:52.351
This is the only place in town.

28:52.419 --> 28:54.052
Chase Powers.

28:54.988 --> 28:56.288
Ashley, uh...

28:56.356 --> 28:58.123
I didn't see you
down at the horse palace,

28:58.191 --> 28:59.392
and I would've noticed.

28:59.459 --> 29:00.659
I was supposed to go
with my boyfriend,

29:00.727 --> 29:03.095
but he was kind of busy.

29:03.162 --> 29:04.363
I suppose he's also too busy

29:04.431 --> 29:06.598
to take you out
on a Saturday night?

29:06.665 --> 29:07.732
No,

29:07.800 --> 29:09.301
it's just that I'm working.

29:09.369 --> 29:11.970
Well, if I was your boyfriend,

29:12.038 --> 29:13.171
I'd be worried
you might run into

29:13.239 --> 29:15.240
some world famous horse trainer

29:15.308 --> 29:18.377
looking to show a pretty girl
like you a good time.

29:18.444 --> 29:20.478
Yeah, he should be worried.

29:20.546 --> 29:21.746
Must be a real jerk

29:21.814 --> 29:22.780
if he doesn't realize
what he's got.

29:24.149 --> 29:26.083
You know what? He is a jerk.

29:26.151 --> 29:27.684
And... you're right.

29:27.752 --> 29:29.387
If he's too stupid
to figure it out,

29:29.454 --> 29:30.854
then I'm gonna
figure it out for him.

29:32.557 --> 29:33.624
Ashley?!

29:34.559 --> 29:35.759
Ashley, not now, please!

29:35.827 --> 29:37.028
Where're you going?

29:37.095 --> 29:38.995
You haven't even taken
my order yet.

29:41.565 --> 29:43.099
Chase Powers.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.534
Hi.

29:44.601 --> 29:45.768
Please tell me you're gonna
stick around long enough

29:45.836 --> 29:46.803
to get me something to eat?

29:46.870 --> 29:48.771
Yeah, sure. What can I get you?

29:48.839 --> 29:49.772
That's what I'm talking about.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.975
Service with a smile.

29:52.043 --> 29:54.176
And I don't just smile
at anyone.

30:00.850 --> 30:02.517
Ash.

30:02.585 --> 30:03.885
I thought you were working
late tonight.

30:03.954 --> 30:05.321
Yeah, I was.

30:05.388 --> 30:07.423
But if I'm your girlfriend,

30:07.490 --> 30:09.358
then why am I working
at a diner

30:09.426 --> 30:11.125
on a Saturday night?

30:11.193 --> 30:12.827
I don't know.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.462
I mean, I guess you could
always ask for another shift-

30:21.703 --> 30:24.172
You like paella, right?

30:26.040 --> 30:27.107
I love it.

30:30.178 --> 30:31.511
Champagne?

30:32.646 --> 30:34.047
I love that too.

30:40.888 --> 30:41.788
Cheers.

30:41.856 --> 30:42.921
Thanks.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.427
I will be right back.

30:48.495 --> 30:49.495
I love you.

30:49.562 --> 30:51.630
Hold that thought...

30:52.832 --> 30:53.899
Right there.

31:11.384 --> 31:12.450
I'm back.

31:16.087 --> 31:18.022
Peter?

31:50.386 --> 31:51.319
<i>Hey there.</i>

31:51.387 --> 31:52.454
Hey.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.889
You know...

31:55.957 --> 31:58.259
I used to be just like you.

31:58.326 --> 32:02.530
But nowadays, I just let
whatever happens happen.

32:02.597 --> 32:04.165
Yeah, but I know
what's gonna happen.

32:04.232 --> 32:07.634
I'm gonna get on him
and he's gonna throw me off.

32:07.702 --> 32:09.369
They only buck
'cause they're scared.

32:09.437 --> 32:12.172
Yeah, but I'm no bronc rider.
I can't...

32:12.239 --> 32:15.942
He...
He ain't no bronc.

32:16.009 --> 32:17.944
He'll give it up quick.
And when he does,

32:18.011 --> 32:20.846
he's gonna do anything
you want.

32:20.914 --> 32:23.216
Okay, but...

32:23.284 --> 32:24.451
Well, if you're right,

32:24.518 --> 32:26.118
you may have just
helped me win.

32:26.186 --> 32:27.986
Well, here's the deal, Amy.

32:28.054 --> 32:29.455
I win another one of these,

32:29.522 --> 32:30.589
who gives a damn?

32:30.656 --> 32:33.658
But you win, now that's news.

32:34.927 --> 32:36.195
Okay. But...

32:37.130 --> 32:38.863
Look, this is my first
competition.

32:38.931 --> 32:41.299
'Kay, I've barely even got
one foot in the stirrup.

32:41.366 --> 32:44.368
Aren't you that Miracle Girl?

32:45.670 --> 32:48.639
Everybody wants to see
a miracle,

32:48.707 --> 32:51.375
and I know you can do it.

33:10.492 --> 33:11.558
Hey, buddy.

33:12.727 --> 33:13.594
Hey.

33:13.661 --> 33:15.262
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:15.330 --> 33:16.397
Sorry,

33:17.399 --> 33:18.499
must've dozed off.

33:18.566 --> 33:19.633
Yeah.

33:19.701 --> 33:20.634
What happened to the paella?

33:20.702 --> 33:22.370
I ate it,

33:22.437 --> 33:24.638
in a pretty dress.

33:24.706 --> 33:25.905
You slept through
the whole night.

33:25.973 --> 33:28.708
Oh man, I'm sorry. I...

33:30.077 --> 33:33.146
These flights are killing me.

33:33.214 --> 33:34.414
This can't be right?

33:34.482 --> 33:36.049
What time is it here?
Is it 9:47?

33:36.117 --> 33:37.484
Yup.

33:37.551 --> 33:39.252
You looked like you could use
a little extra sleep.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.920
I wish. Honey, I have a...

33:41.988 --> 33:44.556
I got a meeting in Calgary
at...

33:45.492 --> 33:48.427
Oh. Well, it's good thing
you slept in your clothes.

33:48.495 --> 33:50.329
Oh man, um...

33:50.397 --> 33:51.430
You're not mad, are you?

33:51.498 --> 33:52.931
No. No, of course not.

33:52.999 --> 33:54.133
You sure? 'Cause if you are,

33:54.200 --> 33:55.167
you know,
I can probably just...

33:55.235 --> 33:57.135
No you couldn't,
so could just go...

33:57.202 --> 33:58.602
Before I do get mad.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.604
Thanks. Thanks.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.875
Tell Amy I said good luck,
okay?

34:04.943 --> 34:06.044
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

34:06.111 --> 34:07.211
It's okay,
you can take care of him?

34:07.279 --> 34:08.246
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:08.313 --> 34:09.380
Love you.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.482
Love you, too.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.851
<i>Well, folks,
we're about to find out</i>

34:15.920 --> 34:17.320
<i>who's gonna walk away</i>

34:17.388 --> 34:20.090
<i>with this year's
Ring of Fire championship!</i>

34:20.158 --> 34:23.025
<i>Not to mention
that brand new truck.</i>

34:23.094 --> 34:25.094
<i>The judges are watching
closely.</i>

34:25.163 --> 34:28.165
<i>Garret still has lots
of time left.</i>

34:29.966 --> 34:31.967
<i>Now his horse has gotta
drag a pole,</i>

34:32.034 --> 34:34.103
<i>just like one day
he'll be dragging a calf</i>

34:34.170 --> 34:36.505
<i>to a branding fire.</i>

34:37.774 --> 34:39.608
<i>Here's a tricky one.
It looks simple,</i>

34:39.676 --> 34:41.909
<i>but a horse has really gotta
trust his rider</i>

34:41.978 --> 34:44.513
<i>before he'll put one foot
on that wooden bridge.</i>

34:54.290 --> 34:56.357
Let's not jinx him, folks.

34:56.425 --> 34:57.825
He's not done yet.

34:57.893 --> 35:00.462
We don't want his head
to swell up just yet, huh?

35:00.529 --> 35:02.129
He's being real nice though.

35:02.197 --> 35:03.730
<i>Let's see how he likes it</i>

35:03.798 --> 35:05.332
<i>when you swing that slicker
over your shoulder.</i>

35:08.436 --> 35:10.104
Whoa... easy.

35:11.139 --> 35:12.206
Whoa...

35:14.242 --> 35:15.576
You know I could push it,
folks,

35:15.643 --> 35:17.943
but I think it's best
for this horse

35:18.011 --> 35:19.345
<i>if I call it a day,</i>

35:19.413 --> 35:21.614
and we'll let the young ones
have a go at it.

35:21.681 --> 35:23.483
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:23.550 --> 35:25.451
<i>So, I guess that's it
for Garret McDuff,</i>

35:25.519 --> 35:27.653
<i>ever the gentlemen.</i>

35:29.490 --> 35:32.091
Sometimes you get,
sometimes you get got.

35:32.159 --> 35:33.558
<i>Give us a few minutes</i>

35:33.626 --> 35:36.060
<i>while we get ready
for our next competitor.</i>

35:36.129 --> 35:37.529
You'll be great.

35:42.468 --> 35:44.136
You know, I think
I might've made a mistake.

35:44.203 --> 35:45.703
Yeah, no kidding.
Walking out on me last night,

35:45.771 --> 35:47.305
you're lucky I didn't fire you.

35:47.373 --> 35:49.706
No, I mean about Caleb.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.342
Why? Did you guys get into
another fight or something?

35:51.409 --> 35:53.444
No. It's the opposite.

35:53.512 --> 35:54.778
He was really sweet,

35:54.846 --> 35:57.114
and no offence,
but it was way more fun

35:57.182 --> 35:58.215
spending Saturday night
with him

35:58.283 --> 35:59.983
than working the late shift
here.

36:00.051 --> 36:01.785
So, what was the mistake?

36:01.853 --> 36:05.355
He's leaving again
for the rodeo and...

36:05.422 --> 36:07.757
I just don't think
that I can handle that.

36:07.824 --> 36:12.061
Okay. I promise,
no matter what happens,

36:12.129 --> 36:14.430
I'm never gonna make you work
the Saturday shift again.

36:16.667 --> 36:17.733
Thanks.

36:23.506 --> 36:25.674
<i>Looks like Chase
is getting it done out there;</i>

36:25.741 --> 36:28.810
<i>He's not taking any nonsense
from that horse.</i>

36:32.048 --> 36:33.114
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

36:35.151 --> 36:36.951
<i>Well, Chase Powers
has completed the obstacle course</i>

36:37.019 --> 36:38.052
<i>in record time,</i>

36:38.119 --> 36:39.920
<i>and it looks for extra points</i>

36:39.988 --> 36:43.291
<i>he's gonna try and load
his colt in the trailer.</i>

36:43.358 --> 36:44.992
Come on! Get in there!

36:46.695 --> 36:49.029
<i>Good! Come on!</i>

36:50.765 --> 36:52.466
All right, now I know this
doesn't look too pretty,

36:52.534 --> 36:54.934
but it's not about me,
it's not about the show,

36:55.002 --> 36:56.236
it's about the horse.

36:56.304 --> 36:57.136
And I know if I let him
get away with this,

36:57.205 --> 36:58.371
whoever ends up owning him's

36:58.439 --> 36:59.172
gonna have a problem horse
for life.

37:00.675 --> 37:01.874
<i>Chase, I think that horse</i>

37:01.942 --> 37:03.510
<i>is trying to tell you
something.</i>

37:05.313 --> 37:06.379
Come on!

37:12.419 --> 37:14.553
What can I say, folks?
The colt's got a problem.

37:14.621 --> 37:17.989
<i>I guess that wraps it up
for Chase Powers.</i>

37:18.057 --> 37:19.991
You'll be fine. Okay?
You stuck with what you know,

37:20.059 --> 37:21.527
and that's getting the horse
to trust you.

37:21.595 --> 37:22.628
Yeah. Okay?

37:22.696 --> 37:25.863
I can do this.

37:26.832 --> 37:27.998
Hey.

37:28.066 --> 37:29.367
I may've screwed up
at the trailer;

37:29.435 --> 37:31.369
That was just a bonus.
I've won with a lot less.

37:31.437 --> 37:32.537
Why don't you get lost, man?

37:32.605 --> 37:34.572
No, Ty, it's okay. It's okay.

37:34.640 --> 37:35.806
He just knows he blew it

37:35.874 --> 37:37.875
and that I'm gonna
kick his ass out there.

37:37.943 --> 37:39.711
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

37:39.778 --> 37:41.911
our third Ring of Fire trainer,

37:41.979 --> 37:43.079
<i>Amy Fleming!</i>

37:43.147 --> 37:44.080
Go get 'em!

37:51.188 --> 37:52.989
<i>So, Amy,
what's your plan today?</i>

37:53.057 --> 37:54.224
Okay. Those phone calls?

37:54.291 --> 37:56.159
They weren't from Badger.

37:56.227 --> 37:57.727
<i>I've gotten to know this guy
a lot better and...</i>

37:57.795 --> 38:00.296
Okay, I mean, the
first one wasn't from Badger.

38:00.364 --> 38:02.331
It was from Jamie's mom.

38:02.399 --> 38:04.333
Jamie wanted to go to Calgary
with her friends,

38:04.401 --> 38:06.701
so I kind of said
I'd lie for her...

38:06.770 --> 38:08.436
<i>It's just a big mess.</i>

38:08.504 --> 38:10.338
Basically, all I wanted
was someone to lend me

38:10.406 --> 38:12.040
a pole-bending horse.

38:12.108 --> 38:14.977
Why didn't you ask me?
My sister's horse is perfect.

38:15.044 --> 38:16.544
He can pole-bend, barrel race...

38:16.612 --> 38:17.980
He can even goat tie.

38:23.018 --> 38:25.352
All right, Crackerjack,
see all these nice people?

38:25.420 --> 38:27.388
There's nothing to worry about.

38:27.455 --> 38:28.422
Why is she taking so much time

38:28.490 --> 38:30.057
leading that damn horse around?

38:30.125 --> 38:32.693
Will you settle down,
for crying out loud!

38:32.761 --> 38:35.763
She's gonna do
what she's gonna do.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.765
<i>I know you like to
work at your own pace, Amy,</i>

38:38.833 --> 38:40.700
<i>but the minutes are ticking by.</i>

38:40.768 --> 38:42.803
Yeah. Thanks for the reminder.

38:42.870 --> 38:44.838
This is something I like to do
with all my jumpers.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.073
I like to show them everything
from the ground

38:47.141 --> 38:49.109
so they can see it
from all sides.

38:49.177 --> 38:50.376
It's not as scary;

38:50.444 --> 38:51.912
They can see that
I'm not scared of it,

38:51.979 --> 38:54.880
<i>so it shouldn't be that bad.</i>

39:00.854 --> 39:03.355
<i>Eh, eh, easy! Easy.</i>

39:12.631 --> 39:14.432
It's all right.

39:14.499 --> 39:17.635
Well, folks, uh...
That wasn't too bad,

39:17.703 --> 39:19.537
<i>and I've got a feeling
there isn't gonna be any more</i>

39:19.604 --> 39:21.372
<i>where that came from.</i>

39:22.308 --> 39:24.975
Whoa... good boy.

39:26.945 --> 39:28.011
Not so scary, huh?

39:29.347 --> 39:30.480
Not so scary.

39:32.150 --> 39:33.483
<i>Good boy.</i>

39:34.819 --> 39:36.153
<i>Good boy.</i>

39:46.263 --> 39:48.797
That's a brave boy.

39:48.866 --> 39:49.665
Good boy.

39:51.969 --> 39:54.070
Well, that was easier
than expected.

39:56.639 --> 39:57.906
Whoa...

39:57.974 --> 39:59.174
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

39:59.242 --> 40:01.076
<i>this is my tenth
Ring of Fire competition</i>

40:01.143 --> 40:03.211
<i>and I've seen some trainers
come from behind,</i>

40:03.279 --> 40:06.081
<i>but this is something else.</i>

40:06.148 --> 40:08.016
Look, I'll go in first.

40:08.084 --> 40:09.450
No big deal.

40:17.692 --> 40:20.361
<i>Look at that, folks.
She did it!</i>

40:20.428 --> 40:22.997
<i>You've still got a couple
of minutes left, Amy...</i>

40:23.064 --> 40:25.632
I don't really know
what else to do, but...

40:25.700 --> 40:27.334
My boyfriend Ty over there
by the gate,

40:27.402 --> 40:32.071
he reminded me that
there is a picture of my mom

40:32.139 --> 40:36.075
when you... when you walk
in the front of this building,

40:36.143 --> 40:39.245
<i>and when she did this
competition years ago,</i>

40:39.313 --> 40:41.781
<i>uh, this is what she did,</i>

40:41.848 --> 40:44.317
so I'm gonna give it a try...

40:56.262 --> 40:58.630
This is for you, Mom.

41:09.308 --> 41:10.374
Yeah!

41:22.905 --> 41:26.140
<i>I just thought
you should know,</i>

41:26.208 --> 41:28.309
whichever way this goes,

41:28.377 --> 41:30.577
<i>you don't have to let the fact
you're working for me</i>

41:30.645 --> 41:32.946
get in the way
of your big dreams.

41:33.014 --> 41:35.148
What are you saying, Jack?

41:35.216 --> 41:35.949
I'm fired?

41:36.017 --> 41:38.451
All I'm saying is,

41:38.520 --> 41:41.622
go to California with that
damn racehorse of yours

41:41.689 --> 41:43.056
and see if I care.

41:45.692 --> 41:46.759
Hey.

41:49.730 --> 41:51.296
You do like me.

41:51.364 --> 41:54.934
Yeah, about as much
as a broken leg.

41:57.905 --> 41:59.171
Are you still mad at me?

41:59.239 --> 42:00.705
Well, we'll see.

42:00.773 --> 42:01.840
<i>Honey,
I knew you could do it.</i>

42:01.908 --> 42:03.207
I didn't doubt you
for a second.

42:03.275 --> 42:04.776
Yeah, it was all we could do

42:04.844 --> 42:05.977
to keep him from jumping
in the ring to give you a hand.

42:06.045 --> 42:07.211
Ty, good job, buddy.

42:07.279 --> 42:08.780
She couldn't have done it
without you.

42:08.848 --> 42:10.314
Oh, I don't know about that.
I think she could have.

42:11.717 --> 42:13.418
Grampa...

42:13.485 --> 42:15.921
I admit it, I, uh...

42:15.988 --> 42:19.723
I wasn't sold on this idea,
but you...

42:20.892 --> 42:22.760
You did so good.

42:32.603 --> 42:34.336
How's it going, Ash?

42:36.473 --> 42:38.507
Come on, get in here already.

42:41.311 --> 42:43.646
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I just...

42:45.214 --> 42:46.716
Okay...

42:48.118 --> 42:49.651
I'm in love with you.

42:51.219 --> 42:52.620
How is that a problem?

42:52.621 --> 42:53.855
That's pretty much the best news
I've ever heard.

42:53.923 --> 42:56.324
How is that a problem?

42:56.392 --> 43:01.129
Because I'm never gonna fit
into your life, Caleb.

43:01.197 --> 43:04.532
I'm not a barrel racer,
a buckle bunny,

43:04.600 --> 43:07.602
and being your stay-at-home
girlfriend isn't gonna work.

43:07.669 --> 43:09.770
Yeah, but...

43:09.838 --> 43:12.406
I love you and you love me.
I mean...

43:12.474 --> 43:13.407
Babe, we can work this out.

43:13.475 --> 43:15.442
Maybe now.

43:15.510 --> 43:18.512
But eventually,
you're gonna break my heart.

43:18.580 --> 43:20.847
And the longer I wait,
the more it's gonna hurt,

43:20.915 --> 43:22.849
so...

43:22.917 --> 43:24.317
I'm gonna save us both
the trouble

43:24.384 --> 43:25.952
and break my own heart.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.655
Please, just think about it,
Ashley, I'm begging you.

43:28.723 --> 43:30.289
Goodbye, Caleb.
