00:41.750 --> 00:43.001
Ji-hun.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.210
Wake up.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.887
Guess what day it is today.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.765
What is it?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.437
It's our 100-day anniversary.

01:02.645 --> 01:03.772
Already?

01:04.481 --> 01:05.523
Time flies.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.610
According to my manager,

01:08.735 --> 01:10.570
word is getting out about us.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.489
I don't get it.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.449
Who could have started the rumor?

01:15.825 --> 01:16.993
I'm sure you did.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.245
Here.

01:19.871 --> 01:20.914
What's this?

01:21.289 --> 01:23.083
What is this? What could it be?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.921
It's so pretty.

01:28.004 --> 01:31.216
Gosh, when did you get this?

01:33.426 --> 01:34.511
It's a farewell gift.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.097
Ji-hun.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.266
It was fun. I hope you meet a nice guy.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.519
Ji-hun.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.497
It's almost time. Step it up.

02:02.664 --> 02:03.665
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.218
They're coming in.

02:15.844 --> 02:16.803
Chef,

02:17.011 --> 02:18.221
everything is ready, right?

02:20.223 --> 02:21.933
My goodness, this looks amazing.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.477
Take some nice pictures.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.687
-Please go in.
-Okay.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.813
This way.

02:41.327 --> 02:45.248
NEW MENU PRESENTATION
TENDERLOIN, SIRLOIN STEAK

02:45.331 --> 02:46.958
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.631
Eun-seong, I need to go right over there
for just a little bit.

02:53.715 --> 02:54.757
-Wait here, okay?
-Okay.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.342
-Stay right here, okay?
-Okay.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.686
We are a family restaurant

03:06.769 --> 03:08.646
-that uses organic ingredients.
-It's so cute.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.482
Our restaurant, The Promise, was launched
with ambitious goals to provide

03:11.858 --> 03:15.445
dishes made from the best ingredients
with high quality service.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.238
For the past three months,

03:17.530 --> 03:20.283
we have worked very hard.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.621
Anyhow, we would greatly appreciate it

03:24.746 --> 03:28.207
if you could spread the word
about our latest spring menu.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.500
Excuse me.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.836
The director of Restaurant Services

03:32.378 --> 03:35.673
from the head office,
Mr. Han Ji-hun, has just arrived.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.676
He says he would like to say

03:38.801 --> 03:41.012
a few words to everyone present.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.972
Mr. Han.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.228
I came to drop off my résumé.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.022
-Come with me.
-Thank you.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.106
Hello.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.025
I'm Director Han Ji-hun.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.403
I'd like to think

03:57.654 --> 04:00.573
that your applause isn't for me,
but for our new menu.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.160
Please enjoy the food
we have prepared today,

04:04.410 --> 04:06.913
and provide us
with honest criticism and suggestions.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.498
If you promote us a lot,

04:08.957 --> 04:11.542
we will hold more of these events.

04:11.668 --> 04:12.669
Thank you.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.130
Please enjoy the food.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.091
For today, it's free.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.848
Please enjoy.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.350
Thank you.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.476
Hello.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.436
Thank you.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.816
Give me your car keys.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.776
Why?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.486
My car is at the repair shop.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.822
Call Mr. Lee.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.075
I sent him back to the head office
for something.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.244
I don't have time to wait for him.
I'll be late.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.497
Where are you going? Do you have a date?

04:50.873 --> 04:51.874
Hey.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.377
You know I got my car
just two days ago, right?

04:54.460 --> 04:56.129
If you scratch it up like last time...

04:57.171 --> 04:58.256
Gosh.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.340
Wait.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.343
That wasn't what I meant.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.304
I meant, be careful.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.680
You never know.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.806
Accidents happen

05:07.265 --> 05:09.058
without notice.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.271
If it gets in the papers
that so-and-so's son got in an accident...

05:15.106 --> 05:17.734
You shouldn't underestimate netizens.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.121
Drive carefully, please.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.169
-Mr. Park, they're looking for you.
-That little...

05:36.502 --> 05:37.503
Okay.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.505
Hello.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.267
Please send us your story.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.486
Hi, Mom.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.905
Where are you? If you haven't left yet,

06:04.030 --> 06:05.531
do you mind dropping by?

06:05.782 --> 06:06.783
Why?

06:06.949 --> 06:08.201
Why else?

06:08.951 --> 06:10.495
It's your dad's birthday.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.626
A wife wants to send her husband
a birthday present.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.836
Drop by and pick it up.

06:18.961 --> 06:19.962
Forget it.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.464
Don't try to force things.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.466
Why is that forcing?

06:23.758 --> 06:25.510
Bye. I'll call you later.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.057
You're so cute.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.526
Eun-seong!

06:49.575 --> 06:50.701
What happened?

06:52.995 --> 06:54.163
Are you okay?

06:54.330 --> 06:55.331
Are you okay?

06:55.665 --> 06:56.707
Oh no.

06:56.833 --> 06:57.834
Mom.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.918
Mom.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.129
-Mom.
-Why aren't you getting out?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.548
You should get out and check
if you caused an accident.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.799
-Are you okay?
-Mom.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.425
-My goodness.
-Mom.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.803
-Mom.
-Ma'am, are you okay?

07:09.011 --> 07:10.888
-Wake up.
-Mom.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.348
-Mom.
-Oh no.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.933
-She's going to die.
-Mom.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.227
What are you doing?
Hurry and take her to the hospital.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.688
-Mom.
-Take her to the hospital.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.441
-Get moving already.
-Excuse me. Wake up.

07:21.566 --> 07:22.733
Mom.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.652
-Mom.
-Is she hurt?

07:25.111 --> 07:26.529
Mom.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.156
Mom.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.157
It's all right.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.491
Mom.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.576
Mom.

07:32.743 --> 07:33.911
I hope she's okay.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.289
You get in too. Sit beside your mom.

07:36.956 --> 07:37.790
Mom...

07:38.833 --> 07:40.460
Here's her phone. Take it.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.423
I hope she isn't hurt.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.508
My goodness.

07:51.846 --> 07:52.847
Mom.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.348
Mom.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.477
My mom is dying.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.770
My mom is dying.

08:01.814 --> 08:02.815
Mom.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.484
Mom.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.070
Mom.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.239
Mom!

08:10.573 --> 08:11.574
Mom.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.825
Mom.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.327
Mom.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.870
Mom.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.873
Mom.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.465
Ms. Kang Hye-su, open your eyes.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.343
Ms. Kang Hye-su.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.511
Ms. Kang Hye-su?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.055
It was a car accident, right?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.515
Was she hit?

08:35.723 --> 08:36.724
No.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.518
I'm pretty sure she wasn't hit.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.686
Luckily, she's responding to light.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.688
Give her one liter of normal saline IV.

08:42.772 --> 08:43.689
Okay.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.316
Mom.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.610
Mom, wake up.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.904
-Wake up.
-It's okay. Come here.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.116
Mom.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.826
Mom.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.252
Gosh, things are going to get complicated.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.629
The mother is unconscious.

09:06.879 --> 09:07.755
What?

09:07.964 --> 09:10.424
Why did she faint if she wasn't even hit?

09:11.050 --> 09:13.928
Wait, what if she's a con artist?

09:14.428 --> 09:15.429
Con artist?

09:15.596 --> 09:16.597
Yes.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.016
Don't believe her
just because she has a kid.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.102
I saw it on a TV program
that talks about current affairs.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.312
There are many of them out there.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.318
Let's talk later.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.238
-I need to find out more first.
-Don't believe everything, okay?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.034
-Hello?
-Hey.

09:37.618 --> 09:38.619
Who are you?

09:38.911 --> 09:40.663
-Pardon?
-Who are you?

09:41.163 --> 09:43.708
We at Daon Hospital provide
high-quality service...

09:43.791 --> 09:46.752
What is your relationship
with the owner of this phone?

09:46.877 --> 09:48.129
What's it to you?

09:48.379 --> 09:50.464
-Where are you?
-We at Daon Hospital will try our best.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.507
-Hello?
-Thank you.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.633
Where are you?

09:53.009 --> 09:53.968
Hello?

09:56.304 --> 09:57.972
Doctor, she's awake.

10:01.851 --> 10:02.852
Are you awake?

10:02.935 --> 10:03.936
Eun-seong.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.605
-Mom.
-Eun-seong.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.690
Does it hurt anywhere?

10:08.190 --> 10:09.650
No, it doesn't.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.612
We need to run some more tests,
so please wait a moment.

10:12.945 --> 10:13.988
Okay.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.948
Why am I here?

10:16.324 --> 10:17.867
Mom, are you okay?

10:18.075 --> 10:19.702
Are you really okay?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.996
Are you alive? You're not dead?

10:22.705 --> 10:25.374
Why would I die?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.835
What happened, Eun-seong?

10:28.586 --> 10:31.088
This man hit you with his car.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.257
-That's not right.
-You hit her.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.638
Eun-seong, I'm fine, so stop it.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.306
You are not fine.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.308
I thought you were going to die.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.853
Why would I die?

10:47.688 --> 10:50.107
I can't believe I'm in the ER.
What a mess.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.817
Let's go home.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.986
-Doctor, would you please--
-Hold on.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.404
Hold on.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.075
Just in case, get examined.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.451
Examined?

11:00.534 --> 11:02.703
Yes. Get a thorough examination right now

11:03.204 --> 11:04.246
so I can see.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.707
Don't say otherwise later.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.584
I can't stand things like that.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.964
Please give her a thorough examination
to make sure she isn't hurt.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.049
No.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.509
I'm fine.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.135
No, you are not.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.513
Get examined, and be done with it.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.903
You should be quiet in a hospital.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.572
Your voice is louder.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.244
How old are you?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.453
What about you?

11:45.621 --> 11:47.415
You should answer
if an adult asks you something.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.541
I'm seven.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.086
You shouldn't suddenly run
into the street like that.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.755
Didn't your kindergarten teach you
traffic safety?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.215
I didn't suddenly run in.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.884
You were driving recklessly

11:59.051 --> 12:00.761
and almost killed my mom.

12:03.722 --> 12:04.723
You brat.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.309
Your mom told you to say that, didn't she?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.561
What?

12:08.811 --> 12:09.770
Eun-seong.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.480
Mom.

12:16.986 --> 12:17.987
Give me your number.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.447
Call me when you get the results.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.449
Okay.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.245
Oh, that.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.667
It was on the ground, so I picked it up.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.919
Put in your number.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.809
If you're feeling fine, you should go.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.144
You know,

12:51.479 --> 12:53.606
you should drive more carefully.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.858
My child was almost hurt.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.697
Let's check the dashcam footage.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.366
-What?
-Look.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.577
You either don't understand what happened,

13:06.660 --> 13:08.954
or you're just pretending
and trying to pull something,

13:09.330 --> 13:10.331
but let's be clear.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.876
She suddenly ran into the street.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.045
I stopped the car.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.589
You fainted without even getting hit
by the car.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.716
Check the test results,

13:20.966 --> 13:22.259
and if you plan to keep complaining,

13:22.760 --> 13:23.761
I'll call the police.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.137
The police?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.223
I...

13:30.851 --> 13:31.977
Wait. I...

13:32.269 --> 13:33.270
Excuse me.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.905
Kang Hye-su's guardian.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.116
You're Kang Hye-su's guardian, right?

13:46.325 --> 13:48.285
-Yes.
-Here is the bill.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.495
You may pay this there,

13:49.620 --> 13:51.580
and please read this information.

13:51.997 --> 13:52.831
Okay.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.137
Where is Kang Hye-su?

14:09.598 --> 14:10.599
Who are you?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.184
And who are you?

14:14.478 --> 14:15.563
I see.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.316
You're the one
who answered her phone, right?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.655
-Yes.
-So you caused the accident.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.032
Did you settle

14:27.616 --> 14:29.076
the compensation matter?

14:30.327 --> 14:31.370
Compensation matter?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.330
Come on now.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.583
Did you settle everything?

14:36.542 --> 14:37.543
It's this way, Boss.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.378
Okay.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.338
I'll see you later.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.393
Eun-seong, be careful.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.061
Oh my.

15:05.654 --> 15:06.864
I don't think we'll find her.

15:06.989 --> 15:07.990
Let's go eat.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.534
This is not the time to eat.

15:20.961 --> 15:21.962
Lady!

15:22.087 --> 15:23.756
Stop right there!

15:23.881 --> 15:25.716
Go. Hurry.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.092
Lady!

15:27.176 --> 15:28.177
Move over!

15:36.143 --> 15:37.394
Eun-seong, that way.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.941
Get in.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.067
Hurry.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.528
I'm sorry. We'll just be a minute.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.906
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.033
What are you doing here?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.117
Eun-seong, hide.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.329
Look there.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.705
Sorry.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.707
Mom, that hurts.

16:04.964 --> 16:05.965
Are you okay?

16:06.465 --> 16:07.466
It's okay.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.053
Hey.

16:13.931 --> 16:14.932
Get out.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.894
Must I take you and your kid
to the police station?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.528
I'm sorry. I was so desperate.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.571
I'm okay.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.909
-What is this?
-Let's end it with this.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.327
Don't bug me anymore.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.998
-What is...
-I don't know if you're her mom or sister,

16:39.206 --> 16:41.709
but are you trying to use a kid
to win pity points?

16:42.459 --> 16:45.170
Get with the times.
That is such a dated scheme.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.589
-I don't think--
-Don't live like that.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.009
Excuse me. I...

16:50.843 --> 16:51.844
Let's get out, Eun-seong.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.721
Be careful.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.098
Excuse me.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.475
Hold on, Eun-seong. Excuse me.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.188
Mom.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.440
What's wrong?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.316
It's okay. I'm fine.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.736
You must have been scared.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.700
Gosh.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.291
-Honey, blow out the candles.
-Sure.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.424
Happy birthday.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.426
Happy birthday, Dad.

17:32.509 --> 17:33.510
Let me pour you a drink.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.598
-Thanks.
-You too.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.809
There are many articles
about the restaurant.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.104
I heard you're even living there.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.898
For the time being.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.233
-Don't overwork yourself.
-Try this.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.320
Why are you working so hard
on a tiny restaurant?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.364
But then again,
I'm sure it's overwhelming to go

17:54.531 --> 17:56.158
from playing the guitar
to running a business.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.826
It's not just a tiny restaurant.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.578
It's the core restaurant

18:00.162 --> 18:03.082
for the future
of our company's restaurant services.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.752
Do you think I would've told him
to run it for no reason?

18:07.294 --> 18:09.046
A small success eventually leads

18:09.171 --> 18:10.964
to great success.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.550
I first started

18:14.009 --> 18:15.969
with a tiny store too.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.888
You are indeed my son.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.515
Your first business is a success.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.184
You have a perfect score so far.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.268
Here.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.436
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

18:25.062 --> 18:25.896
Here.

18:26.355 --> 18:30.234
Punk. You should've stopped upsetting Dad
and helped with his business sooner.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.611
Everyone is happy
now that you got your act together.

18:33.904 --> 18:34.905
I know.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.074
You're always looking out for me.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.826
If I had quit music
and done business sooner,

18:39.409 --> 18:40.911
it would've been easier for you.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.997
Make sure you take care of yourself.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.874
Don't overdo it.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.668
Don't worry.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.923
Excuse me. A guest is here.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.174
A guest?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.511
Oh, Na-yoon must be here.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.637
You invited Na-yoon?

18:59.304 --> 19:01.723
Chairman Seo called earlier.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.892
He wanted to send a gift.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.103
I said it was okay,

19:06.311 --> 19:07.980
but he insisted on sending her.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.231
That's good.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.108
I wanted to introduce her

19:11.483 --> 19:12.818
to Ji-hun anyway.

19:13.735 --> 19:14.736
I see.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.947
No, it isn't her.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.240
Then who?

19:19.908 --> 19:21.827
The lady from Samseong-dong...

19:24.079 --> 19:25.956
That woman still hasn't come
to her senses.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.083
You send her away.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.381
Gosh.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.344
I am

19:39.511 --> 19:42.347
Chairman Han Seong-guk's wife.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.727
Why won't you let me go
into my husband's house?

19:47.352 --> 19:49.479
The neighbors will hear you.
Please keep it down.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.232
Who cares? Let them hear.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.320
My son.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.738
My son is here.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.323
-I'll take her.
-My son.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.243
-Let's go.
-I'm not going anywhere.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.622
I came to see your dad.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.791
Did you drink?

20:11.084 --> 20:12.085
Why?

20:12.169 --> 20:14.129
Can't I drink?

20:17.007 --> 20:18.258
Are you trying to kill yourself?

20:19.009 --> 20:19.968
How could you drink?

20:20.052 --> 20:23.555
I'm treated like I'm dead already.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.766
It doesn't matter how I die.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.768
Let's go.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.395
-Let go of me!
-Let's go.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.813
-Let go!
-Na-yoon.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.399
Jeong-hun.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.484
Hello.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.110
It's been a while.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.740
Who is she?

20:41.823 --> 20:44.493
She is Chairman Seo Jong-chang's
eldest daughter.

20:45.035 --> 20:45.911
I see.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.289
You're the lady the chairman wants

20:49.414 --> 20:50.958
as his daughter-in-law.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.168
Jeong-hun's future bride, right?

20:55.712 --> 20:56.755
You're pretty.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.176
You look like me when I was young.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.179
By the way,

21:05.055 --> 21:06.515
have you heard

21:07.307 --> 21:08.976
who I am?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.689
-Let's go.
-Let go of me.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.066
I need to see your dad.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.236
I said to let go.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.113
Let go of me.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.323
I'm not going back.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.243
Gosh.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.121
I need to see your dad.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.999
-Come on.
-Let go of me.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.877
I'm going.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.507
-Ma'am!
-Oh my.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.634
Don't let any more alcohol
into this house.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.220
-I try to stop her, but it's no use.
-Get up.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.681
-Ma'am.
-Do you want some?

21:48.849 --> 21:51.685
-Please get up.
-I'm fine.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.687
-Right?
-Please go inside.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.189
Let go of me.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.066
-Ma'am.
-Let go.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.901
-Let go of me.
-Oh my.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.486
I can do it.

22:02.112 --> 22:05.032
I can do anything.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.576
You may go.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.202
I'm sorry.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.832
You're being ridiculous.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.501
Why did you go there?

22:16.877 --> 22:17.961
No one welcomes you.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.880
Your dad wouldn't

22:20.505 --> 22:23.133
take my calls.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.471
All I wanted to do was say,

22:28.430 --> 22:31.224
"Happy birthday."

22:33.935 --> 22:36.271
He finds me annoying, is that it?

22:37.439 --> 22:39.399
His health is deteriorating.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.194
He doesn't have the energy to tend to you.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.361
He still can't

22:43.528 --> 22:45.697
take one call?

22:48.867 --> 22:49.951
Did you take your medication?

22:50.368 --> 22:51.620
Jeong-hun's

22:53.330 --> 22:54.706
bride is

22:55.540 --> 22:56.833
pretty.

22:57.876 --> 23:01.171
You should get married too.

23:01.588 --> 23:04.466
Marry someone from a more powerful family.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.468
That is

23:07.177 --> 23:10.222
how you can pay them back for me.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.848
I asked if you took your medication.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.809
That woman was scared

23:14.643 --> 23:16.394
because you suddenly said

23:16.603 --> 23:19.022
you'd run a business,

23:20.482 --> 23:21.691
wasn't she?

23:22.567 --> 23:23.568
She isn't like that.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.196
You're a good son, is that it?

23:26.780 --> 23:28.490
Are you taking her side?

23:28.949 --> 23:32.410
If you don't want to hear that,
quit drinking and live a long life.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.913
If you collapse again, it's over.
Don't you know that?

23:35.247 --> 23:37.207
What's the point of living a long life?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.961
I can't even go to my own son's wedding.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.296
Then keep drinking and end your life now.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.340
Go tell your dad

23:46.007 --> 23:47.759
that I will not

23:47.843 --> 23:50.178
back off like this.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.598
Tell him not to think

23:53.723 --> 23:56.935
that I'll just take his money
and get lost.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.106
He said

24:02.440 --> 24:05.527
I was the only one for him.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.823
He scammed me.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.575
Jerk.

24:11.908 --> 24:12.909
Jerk.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.997
Go to sleep. You're drunk.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.212
Sleep.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.216
Are we moving again?

25:55.762 --> 25:56.763
Well,

25:58.556 --> 25:59.933
this room is too small.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.560
It has no ventilation and it's moldy.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.062
It's so musty.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.564
You said we'd stay here for a long time.

26:07.148 --> 26:08.608
You said we'd stay here for a long time!

26:08.775 --> 26:12.279
We're not going far.
I want to find somewhere a bit nicer.

26:12.487 --> 26:13.488
A bit.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.031
I mean it.

26:15.573 --> 26:17.701
So don't get mad, and eat.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.327
Here.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.997
Who were those men?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.040
Gosh.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.334
How many times must I tell you?

26:26.876 --> 26:29.421
They were following me
to get more tests done.

26:29.796 --> 26:33.466
Those tests hurt so badly that I ran away.

26:33.633 --> 26:34.634
Liar.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.429
Why would I lie about that?

26:39.055 --> 26:40.056
And you.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.475
You'd better be careful
when crossing the street.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.770
You can't run like that without looking.

26:45.895 --> 26:48.398
Look both ways to see
if there are any cars.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.775
I was so scared.

26:52.610 --> 26:53.611
Mom.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.282
You can tell me anything.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.367
I'm not a baby anymore.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.122
Tell you what?

27:05.582 --> 27:07.000
You're still my baby.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.210
That's not funny.

27:11.838 --> 27:14.507
Fine. It's time for a riddle.

27:16.926 --> 27:19.054
Why don't they play poker in the jungle?

27:19.804 --> 27:21.056
Why not?

27:21.639 --> 27:22.891
Eun-seong, why not?

27:24.559 --> 27:25.560
Why not?

27:26.061 --> 27:27.062
Why...

27:28.480 --> 27:29.689
Too many cheating cheetahs.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.483
Isn't that funny?

27:31.566 --> 27:33.485
What do you call cheese that isn't yours?

27:35.111 --> 27:36.196
What?

27:38.656 --> 27:39.657
Nacho cheese.

27:39.991 --> 27:43.036
Nacho cheese!
It sounds like, "Not your cheese."

27:44.245 --> 27:45.663
I got you.

27:47.374 --> 27:48.375
Hold on.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.175
I don't need to answer that.

27:57.884 --> 27:58.885
Eat this.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.350
Chew well.

28:11.689 --> 28:12.690
Is it good?

28:13.983 --> 28:14.984
Eat.

28:15.568 --> 28:16.986
-Hello.
-I thought

28:17.570 --> 28:18.571
you were sleeping at home.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.156
-You're still here?
-Yes.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.282
Go home. Go.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.201
Yes, sir. Good night.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.161
Gosh.

28:25.286 --> 28:27.705
The staff had a drink after cleaning up.

28:27.956 --> 28:28.957
Here.

28:29.582 --> 28:33.503
It's a collection of all the articles
and blog posts.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.506
Good job.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.592
Are you actually complimenting me?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.177
I'm not used to this.

28:41.636 --> 28:42.637
Hey, Mr. Han.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.807
Go easy on us.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.436
Because the head office's
director himself is working so hard

28:49.561 --> 28:51.646
on the restaurant and even living here,

28:51.730 --> 28:53.940
the employees are very stressed out.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.276
You should sleep at home
on a day like this

28:56.443 --> 28:58.528
and miss work every once in a while.

28:59.612 --> 29:00.447
That's right.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.033
What happened earlier?

29:04.534 --> 29:07.245
-With what?
-The con artist you met.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.329
Oh, that?

29:09.330 --> 29:10.331
I took care of it.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.250
Gosh.

29:13.042 --> 29:15.128
Thank goodness it's over.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.673
You can get scammed these days
and the damage could be serious.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.884
Your name will be on the front page
of the papers.

29:20.967 --> 29:24.179
And it will be all over the Internet.
These things can happen to you too, okay?

29:25.305 --> 29:26.890
I'm going up. See you tomorrow.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.350
The car is okay, right?

29:29.517 --> 29:31.186
There aren't any scratches, right?

29:33.104 --> 29:34.814
Why that...

29:34.939 --> 29:36.357
Gosh.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.526
If you borrow things... Gosh.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.238
Only I would put up with this.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.364
Hello?

31:06.447 --> 31:08.658
Hello, is this the person
who caused the car accident earlier?

31:09.075 --> 31:10.076
Car accident?

31:10.952 --> 31:11.953
Who is this?

31:12.287 --> 31:13.288
I am

31:13.872 --> 31:15.707
-the one who was hit--
-You were hit?

31:16.124 --> 31:18.251
I told you that I didn't hit you.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.837
Did you get the test results?

31:24.632 --> 31:25.633
No.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.677
They haven't come out yet.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.013
About that money.

31:30.471 --> 31:31.472
Look.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.683
I said it was over.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.227
Why? Is that not enough?

31:37.937 --> 31:39.272
Don't you dare contact me again.

31:39.689 --> 31:40.732
I'll call the police.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.150
Got it?

31:46.613 --> 31:47.614
What...

31:48.698 --> 31:49.616
Gosh.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.410
Mom...

31:53.828 --> 31:55.288
Mom...

32:25.944 --> 32:28.112
Hey. Didn't you understand me?

32:29.113 --> 32:30.114
I am

32:30.281 --> 32:32.825
your mother's caregiver.

32:35.411 --> 32:36.412
Yes.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.499
She fainted again.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.542
She was throwing up because she felt sick,

32:41.709 --> 32:43.461
and she suddenly passed out.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.129
She threw up blood too.

33:03.940 --> 33:04.941
-Hello.
-Hello.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.275
I had a lot of surgeries scheduled.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.447
Is my mother in bad condition?

33:11.781 --> 33:13.950
It's progressing more quickly
than expected.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.453
We were able to stop the variceal bleeding
in the esophagus,

33:17.578 --> 33:19.455
but I think she'll need a transplant

33:19.580 --> 33:21.624
before it gets any worse.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.918
As of now, she has a low probability

33:24.002 --> 33:26.921
of getting one through
the Korean Network for Organ Sharing.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.425
So if there is a family member
who may be a match,

33:31.217 --> 33:32.802
you should talk to them.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.430
I really can't do it?

33:35.930 --> 33:37.223
You cannot.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.308
First, your blood type doesn't match,

33:39.517 --> 33:40.810
and the tests showed

33:40.893 --> 33:42.979
that your blood vessels
and biliary tract are weak,

33:43.271 --> 33:44.939
so we can't operate on you.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.483
Are there any other family members?

33:48.192 --> 33:49.193
What if

33:50.028 --> 33:51.195
we can't operate?

33:52.447 --> 33:53.698
How much time does she have left?

33:53.990 --> 33:57.035
I can't say for certain,

33:57.368 --> 33:59.787
but you should hurry.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.054
-Hello.
-Hello.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.138
Hi.

34:17.972 --> 34:18.973
Are you going somewhere?

34:19.640 --> 34:20.641
Gosh,

34:20.767 --> 34:23.978
it hasn't been long since you moved in.
Why are you moving out already?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.773
I'm sorry. It's an urgent matter.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.108
Even if it's an urgent matter...

34:31.569 --> 34:32.570
I'm sorry.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.291
Hello there.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.794
It's been a while, Ms. Kang.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.264
Didn't you hear me?

35:01.224 --> 35:02.266
It's been a while.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.269
It was crazy hard finding you.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.438
You should at least say hello.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.526
How did you find me?

35:12.276 --> 35:13.528
That doesn't matter.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.280
What matters
is that you defaulted on your loans

35:16.906 --> 35:18.282
and you're also running from us.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.368
I...

35:21.369 --> 35:23.371
I paid back as much as I need to.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.706
Oh, really?

35:26.332 --> 35:27.667
Let's see about that.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.297
You have six months of back interest.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.299
With the principal,

35:35.550 --> 35:36.968
it's 110.2 million won.

35:37.426 --> 35:38.970
I feel bad for you,

35:39.637 --> 35:40.930
so I'll deduct the 10.2 million won

35:41.264 --> 35:42.807
and make it an even 100 million won.

35:46.352 --> 35:47.353
One hundred million won?

35:48.312 --> 35:49.313
One hundred million won.

35:49.438 --> 35:51.732
You got compensated
for the car accident yesterday.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.610
You can get 20 million won easily.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.445
What?

35:56.863 --> 35:57.864
You didn't get paid?

35:58.823 --> 35:59.824
That jerk.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.993
Should I get it for you?

36:02.702 --> 36:03.953
Please move.

36:04.996 --> 36:05.997
I can't pay you that money.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.331
What?

36:08.624 --> 36:09.625
What?

36:09.750 --> 36:10.751
What's this?

36:11.335 --> 36:12.336
You don't want to pay?

36:12.712 --> 36:13.713
No.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.048
I don't want to pay.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.218
I paid back as much as I need to
and did all I could.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.764
Do you know how much interest I paid you
since my husband died?

36:24.348 --> 36:26.767
I paid back the principal
several times over.

36:28.311 --> 36:31.814
I never bought clothes for my kid
and paid you instead every day. But what?

36:33.357 --> 36:34.483
One hundred million won?

36:35.151 --> 36:36.152
One hundred million won?

36:37.987 --> 36:38.988
Hey.

36:40.656 --> 36:41.949
You're not even human.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.035
Am I an animal, then?

36:44.452 --> 36:45.453
Am I?

36:45.703 --> 36:46.704
Lady.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.289
Don't you think

36:48.789 --> 36:52.168
we're used to hearing these sob stories?

36:52.793 --> 36:54.045
So

36:54.587 --> 36:58.007
why did your late husband borrow
that money from us?

36:58.633 --> 37:01.219
That money is precious to us too.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.139
Do you think I got that money
from the ground?

37:05.473 --> 37:07.725
That's why I paid back as much as I could.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.394
I did all I could!

37:12.563 --> 37:13.564
Hey.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.358
Do I look like a pushover to you?

37:15.900 --> 37:16.901
Do I?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.069
I do, don't I?

37:19.111 --> 37:21.948
If you can't get the money,
sell your body or something.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.491
Okay?

37:23.699 --> 37:26.869
Why are you wasting your body?

37:28.788 --> 37:30.248
Shall I introduce you to someone?

37:34.752 --> 37:36.337
How old is your daughter now?

37:38.422 --> 37:40.049
She's a pretty little thing.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.427
What are you trying to say?

37:43.970 --> 37:44.971
Well, you know,

37:45.471 --> 37:48.057
I just hope she continues
to grow up to be pretty.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.354
You understand

37:53.938 --> 37:55.439
what I mean, right?

37:57.817 --> 37:59.610
If I catch you running away again,

38:00.569 --> 38:01.988
I won't forgive you.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.448
Got it?

38:06.450 --> 38:07.743
Don't starve your kid,

38:08.536 --> 38:09.829
and raise her well.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.393
It won't work.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.086
Hello?

39:41.087 --> 39:42.088
Is this Ms. Kang Hye-su?

39:44.465 --> 39:45.466
Yes, it is.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.968
This is the restaurant The Promise.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.720
You submitted
your résumé yesterday, right?

39:51.138 --> 39:52.139
Yes.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.058
When can you start?

39:56.685 --> 39:58.562
Can we meet today?

39:59.480 --> 40:00.481
Pardon?

40:05.277 --> 40:06.570
Gosh.

40:06.987 --> 40:08.280
You live close by.

40:08.864 --> 40:09.865
It's good.

40:10.449 --> 40:13.369
Why don't you meet the kitchen crew today

40:13.702 --> 40:15.621
and start working tomorrow?

40:16.455 --> 40:17.706
Thank you for hiring me.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.003
But why did you move so often?

40:23.712 --> 40:25.423
I had my reasons.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.509
We had several strong candidates,

40:28.759 --> 40:30.886
-but somebody strongly recommended you,
-Please enjoy.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.222
saying you were highly skilled.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.099
Who?

40:39.728 --> 40:41.105
How have you been?

40:48.988 --> 40:50.406
Please reconsider

40:50.781 --> 40:51.991
what I asked before.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.869
There's nothing to think about.

40:56.036 --> 40:57.037
Give it up.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.999
Please save my mom.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.296
Your mom?

41:05.796 --> 41:07.423
Why should I save her?

41:08.257 --> 41:09.258
You're family.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.552
You're the only person who can save her.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.137
Family?

41:14.346 --> 41:15.598
Is that what your mom said?

41:15.890 --> 41:17.016
That I'm family?

41:17.850 --> 41:19.310
Tell her that I don't have

41:19.727 --> 41:21.061
family like her.

41:22.062 --> 41:24.523
-Uncle.
-I am not your uncle!

41:25.399 --> 41:27.026
You're no nephew of mine,

41:27.193 --> 41:28.736
and your mom is no sister of mine.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.655
She changed her name decades ago.

41:31.739 --> 41:34.825
Why does she say I'm her brother now?

41:39.246 --> 41:40.247
Please.

41:40.623 --> 41:41.624
It's urgent.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.794
I'll give you however much you want.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.885
You have money, is that it?

41:53.928 --> 41:56.388
You're just like your mom.

41:56.972 --> 41:57.973
Fine.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.808
Money takes care of everything,
doesn't it?

42:00.893 --> 42:02.645
Go ask your mom.

42:03.395 --> 42:05.523
When I went to her ten years ago

42:06.524 --> 42:08.776
to ask for just a million won...

42:09.693 --> 42:11.237
When my wife was dying,

42:11.695 --> 42:13.239
and I asked to borrow

42:13.864 --> 42:16.242
just a million won to pay for her surgery,

42:16.325 --> 42:17.743
do you know what your mom said?

42:19.328 --> 42:20.829
She said she didn't know me.

42:21.830 --> 42:22.831
"Who are you?"

42:24.041 --> 42:25.042
That's what she said.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.588
Why are you coming to a stranger

42:29.713 --> 42:31.215
and claiming to be family?

42:31.340 --> 42:34.260
She has all the money in the world,
but she can't find a liver?

42:34.385 --> 42:35.761
Why are you begging here?

42:37.972 --> 42:40.683
You can offer me 10 billion won
or even 100 billion won,

42:41.308 --> 42:44.228
but I would never do anything
for your mom.

42:44.353 --> 42:45.354
Understand?

42:46.522 --> 42:47.690
Who knows?

42:49.108 --> 42:51.485
If she can bring my wife back
from the dead,

42:52.486 --> 42:53.612
I may reconsider.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.532
-Uncle.
-I'm not your uncle.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.286
Wrap things up here.

43:00.369 --> 43:01.537
-Yes, sir.
-I'm heading home.

43:01.662 --> 43:03.163
All right. Goodbye.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.169
Are you done with work?

43:15.509 --> 43:17.386
-Get lost!
-Oh my!

43:17.511 --> 43:19.722
-You're just wasting your time.
-What was that?

43:20.097 --> 43:22.057
-Listen carefully.
-My goodness.

43:22.725 --> 43:23.767
Just because I have no money,

43:24.560 --> 43:26.103
it doesn't mean I have no pride.

43:26.729 --> 43:27.771
Get lost.

43:28.772 --> 43:29.773
Get out of my sight.

44:13.817 --> 44:14.818
Get back in bed.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.195
Why are you up?

44:17.571 --> 44:18.572
How much longer

44:18.906 --> 44:20.115
do I have?

44:23.369 --> 44:24.370
Six months?

44:25.663 --> 44:26.664
Three months?

44:27.706 --> 44:28.707
Who said that?

44:33.128 --> 44:34.129
Ji-hun.

44:35.881 --> 44:37.091
Save me.

44:38.634 --> 44:39.635
From now on,

44:40.719 --> 44:42.805
I will do whatever you say.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.475
I'll quit drinking

44:47.726 --> 44:49.645
and control my temper.

44:50.437 --> 44:53.190
I'll do anything if I can live.

44:54.691 --> 44:55.818
My life can't

44:57.444 --> 44:59.488
end like this.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.448
It's not fair.

45:03.158 --> 45:05.994
You finally got your act together

45:06.662 --> 45:08.497
and started working at the company.

45:09.581 --> 45:11.750
There will be so many good days ahead.

45:12.543 --> 45:15.504
Must I die without seeing them?

45:16.088 --> 45:17.881
I want to see you getting acknowledged
by your dad,

45:18.090 --> 45:19.133
getting married,

45:19.842 --> 45:21.260
and having kids.

45:22.094 --> 45:25.347
I want to see you do those things
before I die.

45:28.475 --> 45:30.602
Do you know what my wish is?

45:32.187 --> 45:35.649
I want to take a family portrait
like other families.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.317
I want one with my son,

45:37.901 --> 45:39.903
daughter-in-law, and grandchild.

45:40.571 --> 45:44.074
I want to take a proper family portrait.

45:46.535 --> 45:49.455
I've been nothing
but a shadow all my life.

45:50.330 --> 45:53.709
I can't just disappear quietly
like a shadow.

45:55.878 --> 45:58.046
Please let me live
a little longer, Ji-hun.

45:58.422 --> 45:59.673
I'm begging you.

46:01.091 --> 46:03.218
Please save me.

46:03.302 --> 46:04.428
Ji-hun.

46:04.511 --> 46:06.597
Please save me.

46:06.889 --> 46:07.890
Ji-hun.

46:08.682 --> 46:11.351
Please save me, Ji-hun.

46:11.977 --> 46:13.896
Ji-hun.

46:17.316 --> 46:18.859
Why didn't you lead a better life, then?

46:19.818 --> 46:21.320
Who told you to live like this?

46:21.945 --> 46:23.614
Ji-hun.

46:24.114 --> 46:25.574
Ji-hun!

46:30.746 --> 46:33.332
Ji-hun!

46:37.002 --> 46:38.295
Ji-hun...

46:41.965 --> 46:43.592
-All right.
-I'll do that.

46:44.384 --> 46:45.385
Okay.

46:53.268 --> 46:55.145
Why is a young person
like you sighing so much?

46:55.687 --> 46:56.688
I'm sorry, Chef.

46:57.648 --> 46:59.816
We're done with lunch,
so wrap up and go home.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.193
Yes, sir.

47:01.610 --> 47:02.611
Chef.

47:03.070 --> 47:05.030
I can't get paid in advance
on my first day, right?

47:07.241 --> 47:08.242
In advance?

47:08.992 --> 47:10.827
Never mind. I'll see you tomorrow.

47:15.249 --> 47:16.250
Bring me the knife.

47:16.583 --> 47:18.585
There is a special wine order at 7 p.m.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.420
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

47:22.839 --> 47:23.840
Where are you going?

47:24.049 --> 47:25.050
Just a minute.

47:26.718 --> 47:27.719
Hye-su.

47:31.974 --> 47:32.975
Seung-ju.

47:35.102 --> 47:36.687
What are you doing here?

47:37.604 --> 47:38.605
Do you work here?

47:38.897 --> 47:39.898
Yes.

47:41.775 --> 47:44.570
Are you the one who recommended me?

47:45.320 --> 47:47.239
No wonder I got hired so easily.

47:49.157 --> 47:50.659
How have you been?

47:51.076 --> 47:52.286
Eun-seong must be so big now.

47:53.078 --> 47:54.079
Yes.

47:55.038 --> 47:56.039
How about you?

47:56.790 --> 47:58.375
Are you staying out of trouble?

47:58.875 --> 48:00.002
Can't you tell?

48:00.168 --> 48:01.461
Look where I work.

48:02.379 --> 48:03.380
You're right.

48:03.880 --> 48:04.881
You're so admirable.

48:07.217 --> 48:08.302
How's Mother?

48:09.845 --> 48:10.846
Is she well?

48:11.471 --> 48:12.472
Yes.

48:13.974 --> 48:14.975
She's fine.

48:16.727 --> 48:19.229
I'm busy, so I need to go.
I'll see you tomorrow.

48:22.316 --> 48:23.317
May I visit

48:24.067 --> 48:25.360
and see Eun-seong sometime?

48:25.986 --> 48:26.987
Of course.

48:27.404 --> 48:28.405
Come over.

48:34.870 --> 48:36.788
Those jerks showed up again?

48:37.831 --> 48:38.665
Gosh.

48:38.915 --> 48:40.626
I thought maybe they'd give up by now.

48:40.709 --> 48:41.710
Look at you.

48:41.918 --> 48:44.296
That's why I say you're naive.

48:44.379 --> 48:46.506
I told you there's no point in hiding.

48:46.965 --> 48:49.968
I was able to avoid them
for a few months this time.

48:50.093 --> 48:51.637
I thought I could breathe again.

48:52.262 --> 48:54.306
So how big is the debt now?

48:56.058 --> 48:57.059
Forget it.

48:57.809 --> 48:59.519
What will change from me knowing that?

48:59.686 --> 49:01.229
You can't pay it back anyway.

49:02.105 --> 49:03.649
My gosh.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.359
What's wrong with your husband?

49:05.484 --> 49:08.153
How could he die on his own
after leaving you that debt?

49:08.654 --> 49:09.780
-Hey.
-That hurts.

49:10.030 --> 49:11.698
What did my husband do wrong?

49:11.823 --> 49:14.117
He just trusted people too much
because he was so nice.

49:14.242 --> 49:15.285
That's not being nice.

49:15.661 --> 49:18.163
That's why he ruined you
and left you behind?

49:18.497 --> 49:19.498
Are you stupid?

49:19.623 --> 49:21.291
And why did you stand joint surety
for a loan?

49:22.125 --> 49:24.378
Gosh. When you were dating him,

49:24.503 --> 49:26.797
I should've locked you up and stopped you.

49:26.922 --> 49:29.883
What was so great about him

49:30.008 --> 49:31.802
that you got married at that young age?

49:31.927 --> 49:33.762
And why did you have to have
a kid so soon?

49:33.887 --> 49:34.930
-Ju-yeon.
-What?

49:35.263 --> 49:37.140
I don't regret having Eun-seong, okay?

49:37.265 --> 49:39.142
I'm just upset, okay?

49:40.936 --> 49:44.439
Gosh, if only my brother hadn't
gotten in trouble.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.985
Gosh, I need to go see that punk later.

49:49.319 --> 49:50.946
-Hello.
-Hello.

49:51.279 --> 49:54.074
Gosh, that jerk.

49:55.242 --> 49:56.201
What would you like done?

49:56.284 --> 49:57.786
-I wanted to--
-Is it your first time here?

49:57.869 --> 49:59.663
Yes. I wanted to get gel nails.

49:59.746 --> 50:00.747
Are you leaving?

50:01.456 --> 50:02.541
I have to pick up Eun-seong.

50:02.833 --> 50:03.834
Bye.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.851
It's just for one month. Please?

50:21.852 --> 50:22.853
The thing is...

50:23.145 --> 50:24.187
Eun-seong, come.

50:24.896 --> 50:27.399
-How cute.
-How have you been?

50:28.525 --> 50:30.527
I'll make sure to pay interest.

50:31.820 --> 50:32.821
I mean it.

50:33.447 --> 50:34.406
Please?

50:34.823 --> 50:35.824
Mom!

50:35.991 --> 50:36.992
Mom!

50:40.245 --> 50:41.246
Mom!

50:42.247 --> 50:43.498
Mom!

50:44.833 --> 50:46.084
Mom!

50:48.128 --> 50:49.212
Mom!

50:52.090 --> 50:53.091
Mom!

50:54.301 --> 50:55.302
Mom!

50:55.969 --> 50:57.220
Please?

51:00.098 --> 51:01.099
I see.

51:02.642 --> 51:03.643
It's okay.

51:04.936 --> 51:06.021
All right.

51:12.652 --> 51:13.570
Eun-seong...

51:14.154 --> 51:15.155
Eun-seong.

51:18.033 --> 51:19.034
Eun-seong.

51:20.535 --> 51:21.536
Eun-seong!

51:23.413 --> 51:24.414
Eun-seong!

51:24.873 --> 51:25.874
Eun-seong!

51:28.418 --> 51:29.419
Eun-seong!

51:29.586 --> 51:30.587
Eun-seong.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.215
What are you doing?

51:33.298 --> 51:34.299
I'm sorry.

51:35.008 --> 51:36.134
Eun-seong.

51:37.302 --> 51:38.220
Gosh.

51:39.429 --> 51:40.639
How old is your daughter now?

51:42.057 --> 51:43.266
She's a pretty little thing.

51:47.103 --> 51:48.104
Eun-seong.

51:48.563 --> 51:49.564
Eun-seong!

51:50.023 --> 51:51.233
Eun-seong!

51:52.818 --> 51:53.944
Cha Eun-seong!

51:56.238 --> 51:57.447
Eun-seong.

52:02.619 --> 52:03.703
Cha Eun-seong!

52:07.290 --> 52:08.291
Mom.

52:09.167 --> 52:11.044
What are you doing here?

52:11.711 --> 52:13.713
Why did you run off like that again?

52:13.880 --> 52:15.924
You promised me, didn't you?

52:16.341 --> 52:18.009
Do you want to get
into another car accident?

52:18.260 --> 52:20.095
Why won't you listen to me?

52:20.554 --> 52:22.055
You left me.

52:23.557 --> 52:27.227
-What?
-You took off by yourself

52:28.436 --> 52:29.688
and left me.

52:30.438 --> 52:32.399
I kept calling you, but...

52:34.067 --> 52:35.151
I did?

52:36.319 --> 52:37.487
You called for me?

52:38.613 --> 52:40.490
I was out of my mind.

52:41.908 --> 52:42.951
Eun-seong, I'm sorry.

52:44.578 --> 52:45.704
I'm sorry.

52:49.082 --> 52:51.710
I'm so sorry, Eun-seong. It was my fault.

52:51.877 --> 52:52.878
I'm sorry.

53:08.310 --> 53:09.394
I'm sorry.

53:10.395 --> 53:11.396
Sorry.

53:25.702 --> 53:27.370
-This much.
-This much.

53:30.332 --> 53:32.792
Tell me.

53:33.168 --> 53:34.794
Are you leaving me?

53:35.670 --> 53:37.172
I won.

53:37.255 --> 53:38.798
-She's not in?
-No, sir.

53:39.716 --> 53:40.967
Darn it.

53:47.557 --> 53:48.767
Darn.

53:49.976 --> 53:51.269
Let's go that way.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.063
Where are we going?

53:53.605 --> 53:57.275
THE PROMISE

53:57.400 --> 53:59.069
Come back here.

53:59.778 --> 54:01.905
Come back here.

54:02.739 --> 54:03.740
Eun-seong.

54:04.324 --> 54:06.493
I'm going to get you.

54:07.410 --> 54:08.370
Eun-seong.

54:08.453 --> 54:09.454
I'm going this way.

54:14.626 --> 54:15.627
Is it good?

54:16.127 --> 54:17.128
Yes.

54:21.841 --> 54:24.594
-Should we make another lap?
-Okay.

54:24.678 --> 54:27.097
Let's go for a walk. I'm so full.

54:33.436 --> 54:35.021
Didn't you go see your uncle?

54:35.438 --> 54:37.023
It didn't work out?

54:39.526 --> 54:40.568
What about going abroad?

54:41.611 --> 54:43.488
-Did you look into it?
-Right.

54:44.280 --> 54:46.408
I looked into it,

54:47.200 --> 54:49.828
but it's not as safe as we thought,

54:49.995 --> 54:51.830
since we don't know the donor.

54:53.456 --> 54:55.208
It has to be a family member, right?

54:55.625 --> 54:59.087
Is there no one else?
Don't you have any other family?

54:59.504 --> 55:02.549
My mom cut off ties with everyone
and led a harsh life.

55:05.010 --> 55:07.679
If the chairman finds out,

55:08.013 --> 55:09.764
maybe he'd help.

55:11.307 --> 55:12.934
Do you think my dad would do that?

55:13.727 --> 55:16.146
He may even be happy
that it has come to this.

55:16.271 --> 55:17.731
No way.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.364
Is there no other way?

55:32.579 --> 55:33.580
My legs hurt.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.040
Your legs hurt?

55:35.832 --> 55:37.333
Should we rest there for a bit?

55:37.709 --> 55:39.169
How long are we going to walk?

55:39.544 --> 55:41.755
We already made ten laps
around the neighborhood.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.632
Come on. This is nothing.

55:45.258 --> 55:46.926
You need to walk a lot for your legs

55:47.093 --> 55:49.888
-to become strong and--
-So that I can run away well.

56:00.273 --> 56:02.150
It's okay. Let's keep walking.

56:02.275 --> 56:04.277
I can walk to the end of the earth.

56:05.487 --> 56:06.488
Eun-seong.

56:07.655 --> 56:08.656
Eun-seong.

56:08.907 --> 56:10.784
Why are you angry?

56:11.618 --> 56:12.786
Eun-seong.

56:14.204 --> 56:15.622
I'm sorry. Let's go.

56:21.252 --> 56:22.253
Are you cold?

56:31.930 --> 56:32.931
Hang in there.

56:43.608 --> 56:45.693
-Have a good night.
-I'll see you tomorrow.

56:45.819 --> 56:46.820
Bye.

56:49.864 --> 56:50.865
Eun-seong.

56:51.866 --> 56:52.826
Let's go inside.

56:56.496 --> 56:57.330
Let's go.

57:24.649 --> 57:26.568
Guess where we are.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.696
This is the restaurant
where I'll be working.

57:31.656 --> 57:33.825
Really? You got a job?

57:34.325 --> 57:35.326
Of course.

57:36.035 --> 57:37.036
Ta-da.

57:46.296 --> 57:47.213
Ta-da.

57:47.881 --> 57:49.215
You know what I'm capable of, right?

57:49.340 --> 57:51.009
I am

57:51.092 --> 57:53.720
going to take over this restaurant.

57:53.845 --> 57:55.096
So many customers will

57:55.388 --> 57:57.724
rush through those doors.

57:57.974 --> 58:00.351
Why has the food gotten so good?

58:00.643 --> 58:01.644
Ma'am.

58:01.936 --> 58:06.024
I know the food is good,
but you can't faint here.

58:11.070 --> 58:12.655
My baby has finally smiled.

58:14.908 --> 58:15.909
Mom.

58:16.367 --> 58:17.368
Yes?

58:17.952 --> 58:19.454
I told you I'm not a baby anymore.

58:20.038 --> 58:21.247
I know everything.

58:22.373 --> 58:23.374
What?

58:23.458 --> 58:25.001
Those men came

58:26.669 --> 58:28.421
to get money from you, right?

58:29.005 --> 58:29.964
Right?

58:30.048 --> 58:31.090
That's not it.

58:31.216 --> 58:32.592
Yes, it is.

58:32.842 --> 58:34.093
That's not it.

58:34.219 --> 58:35.220
Stop lying.

58:35.720 --> 58:38.223
You always tell me not to lie,

58:38.348 --> 58:39.849
so why do you lie?

58:41.392 --> 58:42.393
Eun-seong.

58:51.069 --> 58:52.403
Here. Take this.

58:55.198 --> 58:58.201
10,000 WON

59:03.248 --> 59:04.332
What is this?

59:04.457 --> 59:07.377
Auntie Ju-yeon gave it to me
to buy myself a gift for Christmas.

59:08.461 --> 59:09.712
I don't need it.

59:09.796 --> 59:11.089
Use it to pay back the debt.

59:11.464 --> 59:13.174
Give it to those men.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.218
Let's go home, Mom.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.512
I will kick out those men.

59:17.887 --> 59:19.764
I'll kick them and hit them.

59:20.098 --> 59:21.266
I'll kick them out.

59:21.933 --> 59:23.726
Do you know how strong I am?

59:53.131 --> 59:54.507
Three pairs for 5,000 won.

59:54.924 --> 59:57.468
You're pretty,
so I'll give you 7 pairs for 10,000 won.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.387
-Thank you.
-These are the latest design.

59:59.470 --> 1:00:00.555
Aren't they so pretty?

1:00:00.638 --> 1:00:04.475
-Give me the prettiest ones.
-Okay. One, two, three, four, five...

1:00:07.687 --> 1:00:09.981
Five, six, seven. Here.

1:00:10.773 --> 1:00:12.650
-That will be 10,000 won.
-Thank you.

1:00:12.734 --> 1:00:13.985
Thank you.

1:00:14.068 --> 1:00:15.695
-Goodbye.
-Good night.

1:00:16.029 --> 1:00:17.030
Please come again.

1:00:17.405 --> 1:00:19.324
Why did you come? Go home and rest.

1:00:20.074 --> 1:00:22.035
-Have you had dinner?
-Of course.

1:00:22.702 --> 1:00:23.703
Aunt.

1:00:24.329 --> 1:00:26.664
-Why are your shoulders so stiff?
-Hey.

1:00:27.290 --> 1:00:29.000
Did you get fired again?

1:00:29.459 --> 1:00:30.585
Did you cause trouble again?

1:00:31.210 --> 1:00:33.713
-I told you I got my act together.
-Gosh.

1:00:33.921 --> 1:00:36.007
I'm not the Cho Seung-ju you used to know.

1:00:36.841 --> 1:00:38.259
Trust me, will you?

1:00:38.384 --> 1:00:39.927
You must make me trust you.

1:00:40.011 --> 1:00:42.472
Every time you smile and act nice,

1:00:42.972 --> 1:00:44.766
my heart skips a beat from worry.

1:00:47.143 --> 1:00:49.520
I was only trouble to you, wasn't I?

1:00:51.230 --> 1:00:52.231
That's right.

1:00:52.482 --> 1:00:53.483
Auntie.

1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:55.485
I saw Hye-su.

1:00:58.571 --> 1:00:59.947
She's struggling a lot.

1:01:00.531 --> 1:01:01.532
Did she tell you

1:01:01.783 --> 1:01:02.784
that she's struggling?

1:01:05.244 --> 1:01:07.580
She had it coming to her.

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:09.457
Don't talk about

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:11.417
that witch again.

1:01:12.502 --> 1:01:14.629
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

1:01:49.664 --> 1:01:51.416
They'll think we're robbers.

1:01:52.458 --> 1:01:53.626
I should ask for permission.

1:02:16.607 --> 1:02:17.483
Hold on.

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:18.443
Hold on.

1:02:20.111 --> 1:02:22.155
Just in case, get examined.

1:02:22.864 --> 1:02:24.699
Don't say otherwise later.

1:02:25.283 --> 1:02:26.576
I can't stand things like that.

1:02:34.125 --> 1:02:35.126
Excuse...

1:02:37.044 --> 1:02:38.045
Yes.

1:02:38.337 --> 1:02:40.715
I'm relying on you.

1:02:41.466 --> 1:02:43.676
Ji-hun, I'm glad you're here.

1:02:43.926 --> 1:02:47.096
I know someone in China
who's good at these things,

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:48.347
so I asked him.

1:02:49.056 --> 1:02:50.057
Well,

1:02:50.683 --> 1:02:53.227
it won't be easy, but there must be a way.

1:02:53.311 --> 1:02:54.312
Just wait a little.

1:02:55.605 --> 1:02:56.606
I have no time to wait.

1:03:01.652 --> 1:03:03.529
Find me someone to marry.

1:03:06.449 --> 1:03:09.243
What nonsense is that?

1:03:09.827 --> 1:03:11.496
My mom's wish is to have a family.

1:03:12.079 --> 1:03:13.080
Then so be it.

1:03:14.457 --> 1:03:16.083
Let's make somebody
her daughter-in-law legally

1:03:17.084 --> 1:03:18.085
and get her a transplant.

1:03:21.506 --> 1:03:23.883
So what are you saying?

1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:25.968
You'll get a fake wife

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:28.554
to give your mom a liver transplant?

1:03:30.556 --> 1:03:31.641
How much will it take?

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:33.601
One hundred million won?

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:34.811
Two hundred million won?

1:03:37.021 --> 1:03:38.022
One hundred million won?

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:41.984
Two hundred million won?

1:03:43.361 --> 1:03:46.322
Hold on.

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:48.366
One hundred million won...

1:03:48.616 --> 1:03:49.700
Wait a second.

1:03:50.535 --> 1:03:53.246
My brain can't process what you just said.

1:03:53.830 --> 1:03:55.039
So what you mean

1:03:55.331 --> 1:03:56.457
is you'll marry any woman

1:03:56.958 --> 1:03:58.334
if she agrees

1:03:58.709 --> 1:04:01.087
to give your mom a liver transplant?

1:04:01.337 --> 1:04:02.380
To be exact,

1:04:02.964 --> 1:04:04.215
I'll enter into a contract.

1:04:06.509 --> 1:04:07.844
I don't care how much it takes.

1:04:08.219 --> 1:04:09.679
I'll pay her generously.

1:04:10.012 --> 1:04:11.347
Find someone that will work.

1:04:11.597 --> 1:04:13.432
This isn't just about money.

1:04:16.769 --> 1:04:17.770
What was that?

1:04:47.925 --> 1:04:49.260
What are you doing here?

1:04:50.177 --> 1:04:51.596
Marry me.

1:04:53.306 --> 1:04:54.557
I'll marry you.

1:05:33.471 --> 1:05:34.805
Make sure she keeps her mouth shut

1:05:34.889 --> 1:05:36.349
and doesn't tell anyone what she heard.

1:05:36.724 --> 1:05:38.059
About last night...

1:05:38.142 --> 1:05:39.185
How much did you hear?

1:05:39.268 --> 1:05:40.811
I thought I should return this.

1:05:40.895 --> 1:05:43.689
I don't think you're in any position
to return this.

1:05:43.773 --> 1:05:45.816
You got an MRI after a car accident
last week, didn't you?

1:05:45.900 --> 1:05:47.610
Will I die, Doctor?

1:05:47.693 --> 1:05:49.528
Your chance of survival isn't high.

1:05:49.654 --> 1:05:51.030
Do a background check on her.

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:52.198
Something is off about her.

1:05:55.409 --> 1:05:57.411
