[yawns]

01:06.107 --> 01:08.526
I have never been this jet-lagged
in my life.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.278
I have no idea what time it is.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.906
-It's three.
-P.M.?

01:12.989 --> 01:13.823
A.M.

01:16.117 --> 01:16.951
Tuesday?

01:17.035 --> 01:17.994
Thursday.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.372
And you are...?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.376
I overslept. I have to get to the clinic.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.213
Steph, you've got Tommy.
Kimmy, you have groceries.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.214
See you for dinner.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.758
Deej... It's the middle of the night.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.969
Oh, it's three a.m.?

01:36.638 --> 01:37.514
Tuesday?

01:39.015 --> 01:40.266
I am not doing this again.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.688
What are we gonna do for five hours?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.941
Well, you could give us a breakdown

01:48.024 --> 01:51.194
on the are-you-getting-back-together
with-Steve-or-not situation.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.321
I don't know what's happening with us.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.073
We haven't spoken since...

01:55.156 --> 01:55.990
Japan.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.202
All I know is, I'm single.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.538
You have to meet my dentist.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.457
The last thing I need right now is
to meet someone new.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.000
Oh, he's happily married.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.212
I thought if you were single,
you might want your teeth whitened.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.174
I am starving.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.259
[door closes]

02:14.342 --> 02:17.137
But my body clock is still on Tokyo time.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.472
So it's actually seven p.m. in the future.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.269
What am I in the mood for tomorrow night?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.523
Something from your own house, perhaps?

02:28.606 --> 02:30.733
No, that does not sound right.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.028
Let's see.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.282
I'll have a chicken leg, a string cheese,

02:37.365 --> 02:38.950
and a side of hormone shot.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.453
No, those are mine, Fernando.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.830
I have to give myself shots

02:43.913 --> 02:46.541
to start this whole
in vitro fertilization process.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.793
But I hate needles.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.044
I could help you.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.338
I give Fernando his allergy shots
all the time.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.339
She does.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.008
I am allergic to everything.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.886
Grass, peanuts, balloon animals.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.682
Balloons are fine,
but once they turn into poodles,

03:02.765 --> 03:04.934
it is Sneezeville, USA.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.062
Good morning.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.147
Good evening.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.356
Whatever it is.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.399
How you doing?

[screams]

03:13.818 --> 03:15.111
-What?
-What happened?

03:15.194 --> 03:16.029
Ramona!

03:16.112 --> 03:16.988
Letter!

03:17.071 --> 03:18.114
School!

03:18.615 --> 03:23.620
I am also allergic to pineapples,
almonds, jazz...

03:25.496 --> 03:26.456
Fine.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.791
Let me see why Kimmy's freaking out.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.585
[screams]

03:30.668 --> 03:31.502
[DJ] What? What?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.922
Ramona! Letter! School!

03:34.547 --> 03:35.548
[screams]

03:35.632 --> 03:38.468
Enough with the screaming.
Would somebody read the letter?

03:39.427 --> 03:42.096
It's from the San Francisco School
of the Performing Arts.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.432
Oh, I got in!

03:44.515 --> 03:45.892
[cheering]

03:49.896 --> 03:52.148
All our hard work paid off.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.274
All of the carpools.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.317
And the dance camps.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.610
And the recital costumes.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.279
Our dance dreams are finally coming true!

03:59.197 --> 04:00.615
[Fernando giggles]

04:01.074 --> 04:02.075
Guys, I'm over here.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.827
Ramona, this is not about you.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.915
Oh, yes, it is!

04:08.998 --> 04:10.750
Congratulations.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.924
Bad news, Max.
You're four-one and three-quarters.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.300
Aw.

04:19.842 --> 04:20.885
Wait a second.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.306
I got this hair gunk from Uncle Jesse.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.228
OK. Try it now.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.108
Huh! Four-foot-two.

04:36.943 --> 04:40.280
I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it!
I did it! I did it! I did it!

04:40.363 --> 04:41.781
Hey. What's going on?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.909
Why does it look like
you've been struck by lightning?

04:45.702 --> 04:49.163
I'm finally tall enough
to ride on the Troller Coaster.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.960
It's the scariest roller coaster
at Mighty Mountain.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.504
Oh, I love Mighty Mountain.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.506
I haven't been there since high school,

04:58.589 --> 05:00.466
when my hair got caught in the log ride.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.304
I had big hair.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.765
So, can I go, Mom?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.892
Please? Please, please, please?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.102
Sure. Why not?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.020
Yes!

05:13.479 --> 05:17.025
We can have a mother-son
super-sized fun day!

05:17.692 --> 05:19.569
I'll go pack us some snacks.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.446
Do you want carrot or celery sticks?

05:21.696 --> 05:22.572
Oh, what the heck.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.991
We're having
a mother-son super-sized fun day.

05:25.074 --> 05:25.992
I'm bringing both!

05:29.412 --> 05:30.371
Wow.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.166
I'm finally riding on the Troller Coaster.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.960
What if I'm not as brave as you?

05:36.669 --> 05:37.837
You think I'm brave?

05:38.421 --> 05:41.507
Well, I mean, I don't like labels,
but, you know...

05:42.759 --> 05:45.261
"brave", "tough as nails",

05:45.344 --> 05:46.679
"dashingly handsome".

05:47.138 --> 05:49.057
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those all apply.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.516
So, if I'm gonna do this,

05:50.600 --> 05:53.269
tell me exactly what happens
on the Troller Coaster.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.438
I'm assuming there's trolls.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.106
Trolls galore.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.775
Maybe it's better if I show you.

05:58.858 --> 05:59.692
Sit here.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.782
Your cart takes you up as the sound
of machinery fills your ears...

06:05.865 --> 06:08.743
[makes juddering noise]

06:09.160 --> 06:10.995
Doesn't sound too scary to me.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.208
And then you drop straight down
a hundred feet!

06:15.291 --> 06:16.667
And then you pull into a 360!

06:16.751 --> 06:17.585
[Max screams]

06:17.668 --> 06:19.504
And just when you least expect it,

06:19.587 --> 06:21.714
troll, troll, troll!

06:23.341 --> 06:25.593
Three trolls in a row?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.346
I'm having palpitations.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.767
You're gonna go on
the ride with me, right?

06:32.850 --> 06:33.810
I need you!

06:33.893 --> 06:37.146
Hmm... Well, I mean,
I'm kind of bored with it by now.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.691
But if you really want your brave
big brother on the ride with you,

06:40.775 --> 06:41.692
then OK.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.152
Just remember,

06:43.236 --> 06:45.530
real courage looks fear in the eye
and says,

06:46.239 --> 06:47.740
"Not today, fear."

06:50.118 --> 06:50.993
Wow.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.914
Kara, you've been so helpful.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.791
I'm really lucky you're my student mentor.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.543
You are. I'm the best.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.964
Well, your campus tour was amazing.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.134
Although Fernando never made it
out of the gift shop.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.344
[sighs]

07:13.099 --> 07:16.310
I admit, I was a maniac,

07:16.394 --> 07:17.437
maniac...

07:18.438 --> 07:19.397
at the store.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.316
I was buying
like I've never bought before.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.781
Let me show you to my room.

07:28.865 --> 07:29.782
Immediately.

07:31.826 --> 07:35.496
This outfit makes me want to  Flashdance.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.665
I'll get the chair.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.501
Kimberlina, fill my bucket.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.632
When did I become the normal one?

07:48.134 --> 07:48.968
Hey, Kimmy.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.219
I changed my mind.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.472
I need your help with my shot.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.682
It's harder to stick myself
in the butt than I thought.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.351
I'll stick you in the butt.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.480
Drop trou. Bend over.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.816
Can't we start with
a little conversation first?

08:03.900 --> 08:04.984
I mean...

08:05.067 --> 08:07.028
You know, maybe tell me I'm pretty?

08:09.113 --> 08:11.199
Well, you're not my type, but you're OK.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.993
Step, touch, step,

08:14.076 --> 08:15.328
pirouette,

08:15.411 --> 08:16.746
pas de bourrée,

08:16.829 --> 08:17.997
back, spin.

08:18.706 --> 08:19.540
Again.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.209
Again?

08:21.709 --> 08:23.628
We've been doing this for half an hour.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.379
Can we please take a break?

08:25.463 --> 08:26.839
I guess so.

08:27.256 --> 08:30.384
It's not like anyone's watching us.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.180
Let's have lunch.

08:35.598 --> 08:38.267
This is wheat germ, kale and beets.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.185
Yum!

08:45.441 --> 08:46.400
Um...

08:46.484 --> 08:47.485
It's...

08:47.568 --> 08:49.654
It's kind of chalky and tastes like dirt.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.824
I know.
It's so much better than it used to be.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.038
Ooh! So, what do you do at school
besides dance?

08:59.121 --> 09:00.748
Oh, we have lots of fun.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.042
We warm up, we cool down,

09:03.125 --> 09:04.043
we stretch.

09:04.126 --> 09:07.755
Oh, and on Fridays, we ice our joints.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.133
But mostly, we dance.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.511
So, no parties?

09:13.594 --> 09:15.596
No hanging out at the mall with friends?

09:16.055 --> 09:16.931
No boys?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.516
Oh, no!

09:19.225 --> 09:21.727
This isn't high school, it's SaFSPA.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.688
And you're gonna love it.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.070
"Get out while you still can"?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.447
[loudly] No!

09:33.531 --> 09:35.283
I love SaFSPA!

09:35.366 --> 09:38.869
It's the best decision I ever made.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.747
[hisses] Run!

09:43.916 --> 09:45.459
Now, don't you worry.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.961
I've given lots of shots,

09:47.044 --> 09:50.131
and I know how to make the patient
feel relaxed,

09:50.214 --> 09:51.799
and at ease, and--

09:51.882 --> 09:52.842
Sweet cheese!

09:52.925 --> 09:54.760
This isn't a needle. It's a lawn dart.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.972
Not helping.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.099
I'm sorry.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.184
Now, the key is to distract the patient

10:02.268 --> 10:03.603
so they don't see it coming.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.188
[makes ringing noise]

10:07.440 --> 10:08.441
Hello?

10:08.941 --> 10:09.942
Oh! It's for you.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.780
I know this is gonna hurt.
Can we just get on with the pain?

10:15.656 --> 10:18.075
OK, but before I do, look.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.870
I know we haven't always gotten along.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.830
But the real truth is,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.374
you're like a sister to me.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.504
And I really want this baby thing
to work for you,

10:30.588 --> 10:32.757
because you are gonna be a great mom.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.799
Wow.

10:34.383 --> 10:37.053
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.055
I think I might cry.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.224
Well, go ahead. We're done.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.726
Here's your lollipop.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.316
Wait-- You gave me my shot already?

10:50.399 --> 10:51.525
-Mm-hm.
-When?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.737
While I was blathering on about
sister this and baby that.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.030
Now...

10:57.281 --> 10:59.533
If you'll excuse me,
I need to take this call.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.579
I told you not to call me on this banana.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.838
[troll growls]

11:14.048 --> 11:15.091
Whoo!

11:15.174 --> 11:18.094
Who's ready for the Troller Coaster?

11:19.136 --> 11:20.888
I know I am!

11:20.971 --> 11:25.559
Whoo-hoo! Yee-ha, yeah!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

11:25.643 --> 11:27.728
Mom, what are you doing?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.565
I know. I'm just trying to stay pumped.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.151
This wait has been excruciating.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.571
It will all be worth it
when we get the scare of our lives.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.157
You're next. Are you alone?

11:40.825 --> 11:42.201
Well, for now.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.413
I just-- I broke up with my
boyfriend-slash-business-partner,

11:45.496 --> 11:47.998
and my high-school sweetheart
might be back.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.583
But who knows? I had to--

11:50.584 --> 11:52.878
Oh, oh, you mean for the ride.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.505
Um...

11:54.964 --> 11:56.048
Yeah, I'm alone.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.217
Big surprise.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.388
[shouts] Alright!
We've got a single rider!

12:02.471 --> 12:05.891
She's a lonely lady
with a complicated story.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.271
Come on. Don't make her ride alone.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.730
She's desperate!

12:13.858 --> 12:15.276
Is that really necessary?

12:15.359 --> 12:16.235
No,

12:16.318 --> 12:17.695
but it's the only joy I get.

12:18.654 --> 12:19.697
[Steve] Excuse me, guys.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.074
Excuse me. Sorry. Coming through.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.871
Steve? What are you doing here?

12:26.954 --> 12:28.998
He's cutting, is what he's doing here.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.209
Hey, this is Craig, up top the TC.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.627
We got a cutter.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.714
Relax, pal. I'm a doctor.

12:36.797 --> 12:37.923
What kind of doctor?

12:38.674 --> 12:39.758
Podiatrist.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.094
That's not a real doctor.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.305
You sound like my mother.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.683
Steph told me where to find you.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.269
I just landed.
I couldn't wait to talk to you.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.146
OK. But can we do this someplace else?

12:52.229 --> 12:54.857
Like, not inside a troll?

12:54.940 --> 12:55.900
No! No, no.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.526
[stammers] This cannot wait, OK?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.445
I have something important to ask you.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.491
How was your flight?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.328
[troll growls]

13:07.411 --> 13:09.079
Did that troll just sneeze on me?

13:16.795 --> 13:19.548
OK! You're next.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.760
You know what, Max?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.845
What do you say we ditch this kiddie ride

13:24.929 --> 13:26.347
and grab some funnel cakes?

13:27.598 --> 13:29.683
Are you kidding? This is why we came.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.852
Come on, guys. It's time to...

13:32.394 --> 13:33.896
rock 'n' troll.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.905
I'm sorry, Max. I thought I could do this,
but I can't. It's too scary.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.074
This is Craig, up top the TC.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.325
Hold the ride.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.494
We got a code three BBC.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.246
That's a Big Baby Chicken.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.751
Why are you freaking out?
You've already been on this.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.045
Look, I lied, OK? I hate roller coasters.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.465
Even the tram ride from the parking lot
got me a little queasy.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.009
Why would you lie to me?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.094
Because...

14:05.177 --> 14:06.387
for the first time ever,

14:06.762 --> 14:08.138
you actually looked up to me.

14:08.597 --> 14:09.723
You called me "brave."

14:10.724 --> 14:12.434
Just remember what you told me.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.854
Real courage looks fear in the eye
and says,

14:16.814 --> 14:19.024
"Not today, fear!"

14:21.402 --> 14:22.820
Nah, doesn't sound like me.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.406
I'm more of a
"Fear, you make a good point" kind of guy.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.576
Well, if you're too scared to do it,
then...

14:29.994 --> 14:31.161
Then let's just go home.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.999
Wait, wait. Hold on a second, Max. Look.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.876
[sighs]

14:36.959 --> 14:38.502
I know this was your dream...

14:38.586 --> 14:40.504
and I don't want to be the one
to crush it.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.340
Let's rock 'n' troll!

14:43.883 --> 14:44.967
That's my hero!

14:51.307 --> 14:53.434
Here we go!

14:54.852 --> 14:55.895
Hey, Craig!

14:56.395 --> 14:58.856
That would have been a great time
to press the "go" button.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.362
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.364
[troll growls]

15:07.781 --> 15:09.116
OK. Now I'm scared.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.498
DJ, I've been thinking a lot
about you and me.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.169
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot
about you, too.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.421
Well...

15:23.172 --> 15:25.132
I don't know how to tell you this, so...

15:25.215 --> 15:26.800
I'm just gonna say it.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.011
Oh, my God!

15:29.094 --> 15:30.679
[Steve and DJ screaming]

15:35.434 --> 15:37.311
Max, in case we don't make it,

15:37.770 --> 15:40.105
I'm sorry I stole money
from your secret stash

15:40.189 --> 15:41.941
and ate your Skinny Cow ice cream.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.902
And I'm sorry I fold your clothes
when you're sleeping.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.362
You did wha--

15:49.573 --> 15:50.824
[trolls growl]

15:55.371 --> 15:58.582
[troll laughs menacingly]

15:59.124 --> 16:01.293
[troll roars]

16:01.377 --> 16:02.753
Hold me!

16:07.841 --> 16:09.760
-Whoa.
-Wow...

16:13.055 --> 16:14.765
[screaming]

16:29.196 --> 16:32.491
[Max] Holy chalupa!

16:37.121 --> 16:39.415
[panting]

16:41.917 --> 16:45.129
Hey, did I say anything about my feelings?

16:45.212 --> 16:47.006
Oh, mostly you just screamed,

16:47.089 --> 16:48.549
"I don't want to die!"

16:49.967 --> 16:52.386
To be fair, those were my feelings.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.141
There's the line cutter right there.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.810
Hey! Hey, where are you taking him?

16:59.893 --> 17:01.103
Where all the cutters go.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.688
Security Land.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.190
DJ, wait for me!

17:11.447 --> 17:12.948
We're alive!

17:13.032 --> 17:13.866
Yes!

17:14.742 --> 17:16.994
-[Max] Amazing!
-[Jackson] I did not expect the drop.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.204
Oh, my gosh. That must have been 200 feet.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.123
-Yeah.
-Straight down, plummeting.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.751
-[Max] A troll got close to our faces!
-I saw it.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.754
Mom, we did it, and it was amazing!

17:27.337 --> 17:29.423
We looked fear in the eye, and we said--

17:32.051 --> 17:34.803
[Max retching]

17:38.223 --> 17:39.224
Let's ride it again!

17:46.482 --> 17:48.317
Is Cosmo gonna be OK, Dr. Tommy?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.943
All better.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.236
[Stephanie laughs]

18:00.537 --> 18:01.580
So, Stephanie,

18:01.663 --> 18:04.333
have you noticed any side effects
from the hormone shot yet?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.001
No, I'm great.

18:06.085 --> 18:06.919
Really?

18:07.252 --> 18:09.922
Because Kimmy tells me
you may experience nausea,

18:10.005 --> 18:12.841
mood swings, sudden unexplained rage...

18:12.925 --> 18:14.968
[angrily] Fernando, I told you I am fine!

18:17.346 --> 18:20.599
[laughing] I am so sorry.
I don't know where that came from.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.895
Well, maybe it was the hormones.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.897
[angrily] I know where it came from!

18:28.899 --> 18:31.235
Whew-- I'm... I'm sorry. I-- Wow.

18:34.696 --> 18:35.572
Hey, guys.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.574
There's my tiny dancer.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.868
[cell phone rings]

18:40.369 --> 18:41.870
That's weird, it's SaFSPA.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.831
Hello?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.666
Yes, this is Ramona.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.377
Wait, what?

18:49.503 --> 18:51.880
This is so unfair.
How could you do this to me?

18:53.632 --> 18:54.883
Thanks for ruining my life!

18:56.260 --> 18:58.345
Well, is it good news or bad?

19:00.722 --> 19:02.391
They said there's been a mix-up,

19:02.474 --> 19:04.685
that there isn't a spot for me after all.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.812
This is completely unacceptable.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.480
How can they do this to you?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.817
Looks like I'm doomed to a life
of regular high school.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.612
Oh, I feel awful.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.738
Me too.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.032
[Stephanie wails]

19:21.201 --> 19:23.787
Why do we even bother living?

19:24.913 --> 19:29.918
We're just ants marching in a line
that can be stepped on at any time.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.672
Stephanie, are you OK?

19:35.257 --> 19:37.134
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'm fine. Why?

19:38.468 --> 19:39.887
You guys are the weird ones.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.319
Just a minute!

19:59.740 --> 20:00.616
Come in.

20:03.785 --> 20:04.661
Hey, honey.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.914
We feel so bad for you.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.415
It's OK, guys.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.958
I feel like I'll bounce back.

20:10.834 --> 20:11.710
Someday.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.547
Oh, you left your cell phone downstairs.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.090
You didn't miss any messages.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.384
Except this one, from Lola.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.220
Would you like to read it?

20:21.762 --> 20:22.930
Certainly.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.019
"Did your parents buy it when I called

20:29.102 --> 20:31.521
and pretended to be your dance school?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.815
LOL, LOL, winky face."

20:36.860 --> 20:38.195
That could mean anything.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.365
Why don't you want to go to dance school?

20:42.950 --> 20:44.785
It's not because I don't love dancing.

20:44.868 --> 20:45.702
I do.

20:46.703 --> 20:50.165
I-- I just realized that
I don't want it to be my whole life.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.584
You know, I want to be a regular teenager

20:52.668 --> 20:54.086
and hang out with my friends,

20:54.169 --> 20:55.587
and have a boyfriend,

20:55.671 --> 20:57.464
and chew solid food.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.760
So, why did you not tell us?

21:03.387 --> 21:05.430
Because I thought you'd be disappointed.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.268
And you guys have done everything for me.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.144
And I didn't want to let you down

21:11.228 --> 21:13.355
after the time and money
you've invested in me.

21:14.773 --> 21:18.151
Oh, honey, you're not an investment.
You're our daughter.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.487
Our very expensive daughter.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.867
Your dancing isn't what's important to us.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.244
Your happiness is.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.581
Thanks, you guys.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.795
You know,
the fact that I don't have to dance

21:36.878 --> 21:38.422
makes me want to dance.

So do I!

You know, I think we're approaching
the point in our relationship

where you might actually be fun
to be around.

22:12.205 --> 22:15.042

gonna be a pain in the butt.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.349
But I don't know how much time I have.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.684
They could be right behind me.

-What are you talking about?
-I busted out of Security Land.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.024
Well, actually,

22:39.107 --> 22:40.901
I said, "I have to go to the bathroom,"

22:40.984 --> 22:42.110
then I never came back.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.448
Boys, can I have a moment alone
with Steve?

22:46.531 --> 22:47.407
Why?

22:47.491 --> 22:50.285
Well, you're a little too young
to understand.

22:50.368 --> 22:53.205
Is it because Steve dumped CJ
and you dumped Matt

22:53.288 --> 22:56.291
because you both still have
unresolved feelings for each other?

22:59.044 --> 22:59.920
No.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.089
Well... Maybe. Just...

23:02.172 --> 23:03.548
Go to your room, please.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.264
Well, I guess Max kind of summed it up.

23:12.265 --> 23:14.101
We do have all these feelings,

23:14.601 --> 23:17.020
but we both just got out
of serious relationships.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.064
So, what... What do we do now?

23:19.147 --> 23:21.566
Well, part of me wants
to ask you out on a date,

23:21.650 --> 23:25.278
but I don't think it would be right
to jump into something else so quickly.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.488
Yeah, I agree.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.367
We both need time to deal
with what happened in Japan

23:30.450 --> 23:34.871
so we don't bring in any baggage
with whatever happens next.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.333
And when exactly does
"whatever happens next" happen?

23:39.292 --> 23:40.293
I don't know.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.671
Two weeks seems too soon.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.507
Yeah, but six weeks
seems like way too long.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.136
So, how about a month?

23:51.304 --> 23:53.431
I've waited 20 years to be with you.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.018
What's one more month?

24:00.230 --> 24:01.690
Aw!

24:02.941 --> 24:05.402
Look at you two. So cute.

[crying] You're having a moment,
and I just ruined it.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.120
Oh! The old mariner!

24:15.871 --> 24:17.914
Look at him. He's so creepy.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.916
But I love him so much.

24:22.002 --> 24:26.423
Oh! Why am I going up the stairs
when my room is in the basement?

24:33.430 --> 24:34.848
I think I'd better get going.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.309
So, um...

24:40.145 --> 24:41.396
I'll see you in a month.

Starting right now.
