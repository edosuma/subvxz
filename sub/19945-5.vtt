WEBVTT

00:46.046 --> 00:48.966
What the fuck?! What the fuck?!

00:49.049 --> 00:51.677
What the fuck?! You've got a gun?!

00:51.760 --> 00:53.762
You've got a you!

00:53.845 --> 00:55.597
You've got a gun!

00:55.681 --> 00:57.099
The thing is that you...

01:00.352 --> 01:02.688
This is so<i> Ray Donovan,</i> am I right?

01:02.771 --> 01:06.483
I asked you if you have a gun
and you said no!

01:06.567 --> 01:07.693
Oh, here.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.654
That box is for weed!
Don't taint my weed box!

01:10.737 --> 01:12.114
Oh, God.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.157
Frankie, come here.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.618
Just sit down for a second
and hear me out.

01:16.702 --> 01:17.869
Please?

01:17.953 --> 01:20.956
I'll pace, thank you.
You know, moving target.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.624
You're right.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.209
I didn't tell you about the gun.

01:24.293 --> 01:27.170
But only because I knew
it was gonna upset you.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.924
Isn't that me being sensitive
to your feelings?

01:31.008 --> 01:33.719
Only if "sensitive" and "feelings"
are marksman terms.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.221
Why do we have to make
such a big deal of this?

01:36.305 --> 01:37.514
This is a big deal!

01:37.598 --> 01:39.308
You just shot a gun in our house.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.018
It could have been me!

01:42.060 --> 01:43.520
It is me!

01:43.603 --> 01:48.442
Oh, God! You shot it-- her-- me
right between the eyes!

01:48.525 --> 01:50.485
Look, I didn't go on a murder spree.

01:50.569 --> 01:51.445
I just shot that...

01:52.779 --> 01:54.406
What is that thing? A dummy?

01:54.489 --> 01:57.451
The politically correct term is "decoy."

01:57.534 --> 02:03.457
Well, I'm sorry that I scared you,
but that... "decoy" scared me.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.375
Oh, you poor, scared murderer.

02:05.459 --> 02:09.630
It's not murder
if it's an inanimate object!

02:09.713 --> 02:13.383
-I hate guns! You know that.
-I do know that.

02:13.467 --> 02:17.512
I do know that, but look, the thing is
I am a really responsible gun owner.

02:17.596 --> 02:21.725
I keep it in a safe, I lock up the bullets
separately, and I'm a great shot.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.895
I mean, you have to admit,
that is very impressive.

02:24.978 --> 02:29.566
Shooting someone between the eyes,
from behind, in the dark.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.654
Nothing you can say will make this okay.
I will not live with a gun in the house.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.490
You have to get rid of it. End of story.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.116
Not "end of story."

02:38.200 --> 02:40.869
Frankie, you told me that you feel safe
because of me.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.205
To keep you safe, I have to feel safe.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.374
I feel safe when I have
a gun in the house.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.875
Ergo, we need a gun.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.710
Don't you "ergo" me.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.671
And there is no "we"
until you get rid of that gun.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.674
Oh.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.895
What are you doing out here?

03:08.814 --> 03:09.940
Couldn't sleep.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.609
I keep thinking about last night.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.112
It still is last night.

03:15.195 --> 03:20.492
Yes, well, guilt is nature's Adderall
and shame is nature's cocaine.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.079
So, I'm riding kind of
a stimulating cocktail right now.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.124
You don't have
to keep beating yourself up.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.837
I keep thinking about
why I got so upset last night.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.422
And you were right.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.719
I do have this weird shame
about being in the closet all those years.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.512
Why?

03:41.471 --> 03:42.973
We're out now.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.225
I'm not entirely out.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.977
What are you talking about?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.855
I'm talking about my mother.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.315
This is about your mother?

03:53.775 --> 03:55.235
I have to do it, Sol.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.779
I have to come out to her.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.616
Oh, God. Please don't.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.871
You don't owe
that Irish Voldemort anything.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.289
I'd be doing it for me.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.834
You think coming out to her
is going to make you feel better?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.669
Yes, I do.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.715
When has that woman ever
made you feel better about anything?

04:19.009 --> 04:24.389
Does she still refer to me as
"the loud, tall Jew at the law firm"?

04:24.473 --> 04:27.434
Only to distinguish you
from the "slender, black one."

04:27.517 --> 04:30.645
She's never going to give you
what you want.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.690
She's not capable of it.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.734
Sol, I know what she's like.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.571
I'm not expecting her
to suddenly sprout a new personality.

04:39.654 --> 04:43.825
You want me to come with you?
Distract her with my lanky Semitism?

04:43.909 --> 04:45.368
I appreciate the offer...

04:46.661 --> 04:48.330
but I need to do this alone.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.541
Okay, just...

04:53.752 --> 04:56.588
promise me you won't let her get to you.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.965
I promise.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.973
What's wrong with me?
I usually revel in an awful break-up.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.977
-Like Craig Diettrick.
-Craig Diettrick, exactly!

05:11.061 --> 05:13.104
The audacity of dumping me at prom.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.983
At least you got him back
when you changed his yearbook quote to

05:17.067 --> 05:19.820
"I'm Craig
and neither of my balls have descended."

05:19.903 --> 05:21.988
That's what he gets
for catching me cheating on him.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.534
This is fun.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.662
-I never have fun anymore.
-Oh, me either.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.457
What if I had Mitch
watch the kids tonight?

05:32.541 --> 05:33.834
You and I could go out.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.044
We are out.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.005
No, I mean "out" out... at night.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.007
Look. Look!

05:41.091 --> 05:44.219
Amazing baby cleavage.
I could borrow one of your slutty dresses.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.513
Let's go out and look slutty together.
Fun!

05:46.596 --> 05:50.267
If only I didn't already have plans.
Before you ask,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.477
if you're not a box of wine
and a bag of donuts,

05:52.561 --> 05:56.565
or a bag of wine and a box of donuts,
those plans don't concern you.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.943
Do you want me to ruin your pedicure,
because I will smudge it, bitch.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.530
Okay. Okay. I'll go!

06:19.754 --> 06:20.881
Frankie?

06:21.756 --> 06:23.049
Frankie!

06:24.509 --> 06:26.595
Okay, breaker one-nine.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.681
Frankie, hello!

06:42.777 --> 06:45.363
Now you're not even answering
your walkie-talkie?

06:46.114 --> 06:47.490
I lost it.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.367
What are you doing, Frankie?

06:49.451 --> 06:53.747
I'm not going into the house
until you get rid of your .55 Magnum.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.459
Don't you think this civil disobedience
show is a bit much, huh?

06:57.542 --> 06:59.544
I saw this on an episode
of<i> The Brady Bunch.</i>

06:59.628 --> 07:02.464
So did I,
and it was very effective for Marcia.

07:02.547 --> 07:06.009
Well, I see you've eaten.
How'd you get your breakfast?

07:06.092 --> 07:08.845
I opened the kitchen window,
used my grabber to reach in

07:08.928 --> 07:10.180
to get a bagel and jam.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.434
By the way, there's a fair amount of jam
on the floor in the kitchen.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.812
Come on, Frankie. We haven't gotten
anything done since the break-in.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.565
How are we supposed to catch up
if you refuse to come inside?

07:20.649 --> 07:23.735
Think of it like you're in
the New York office and I'm in Tokyo.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.613
I'll Skype you once I figure out
the time difference.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.615
Really, Frankie?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.827
I think I've made myself perfectly clear.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.330
I'm not coming in
until you get rid of your--

07:35.413 --> 07:37.916
You're gonna have to come into the house
if you wanna keep berating me.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.627
Damn it!

07:45.590 --> 07:46.841
Good. Now...

07:48.218 --> 07:51.513
we're gonna have to send out an email
blast to drive people to our website.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.932
-We need traffic.
-Whoa. Slow your roll.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.309
None of that's happening
until you get rid of that gun.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.978
I get it. You're mad.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.938
We were both upset last night.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.899
A gun was fired. A doll was shot.

08:02.983 --> 08:07.612
A "doll"? A decoy, of me,
with some of my actual hair!

08:07.696 --> 08:09.322
But it wasn't you.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.951
If it were, then, yes, it would be bad.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.452
Prison bad.

08:14.536 --> 08:18.915
You held my face in your hands
and promised me.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.168
Frankie, I have had that gun for 15 years.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.005
I have had it at the beach house
this whole time.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.424
You didn't care
when you didn't know about it.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.051
Why can't you just go back
and not know about it?

08:30.135 --> 08:34.389
I know we've had our shit, but at least
we've always been honest with each other.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.269
I'm sorry, okay?

08:41.563 --> 08:43.273
Can we please just move on?

08:43.356 --> 08:46.568
Sure. Fine. No problem.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.778
Except no fucking way.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.795
May the truth live in my mind,
on my lips, and in my heart.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.689
Hello, Mother.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.691
Robert.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.529
Well, I wasn't expecting you.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.951
Did my birthday come twice this year,

09:37.035 --> 09:39.079
or were you afraid I'd die
before Christmas?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.831
You're never gonna die.
You're far too stubborn.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.546
Your Aunt Ann came by last month.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.800
-So you're speaking to each other again?
-No.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.802
And how is Uncle Billy?

09:53.885 --> 09:55.845
I'm not speaking to him, either.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.099
What's that you're working on?

10:00.892 --> 10:05.355
Friday's crossword. Once I finish this,
I have nothing left to live for.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.649
I brought you something.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.025
It's a Kindle.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.695
It's really amazing. You just tell me
all the books you want to read,

10:12.779 --> 10:17.283
I order them online, and they show up
right in here almost immediately.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.077
It's all done electronically.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.372
Yes. I know what a Kindle is, dear.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.748
Mrs. Montgomery has one.

10:23.832 --> 10:24.916
Oh, good.

10:24.999 --> 10:28.503
She doesn't like it. It's too bright.
She says it hurts her eyes.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.005
Well, I can adjust the brightness for you.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.257
I don't know.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.719
I suppose it seems a little...
self-indulgent

10:36.803 --> 10:39.264
not even to be able
to turn your own pages.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.517
I'd miss the feeling
of earning my pleasure.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.310
Right.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.691
So why did you come to see me today?

10:51.901 --> 10:56.531
I, uh, just wanted to talk about...
stuff in my life.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.158
Don't mumble.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.910
Is everyone okay? The girls?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.871
No, everyone's fine. It's nothing bad.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.874
That's what you said when you told me
about the divorce.

11:06.457 --> 11:10.253
Oh. Well, actually, I...

11:11.963 --> 11:14.090
want you to know that I, uh...

11:15.216 --> 11:16.801
recently got remarried.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.428
Oh.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.765
Well, I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail. Who is she?

11:22.849 --> 11:24.767
How young is she?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.063
You remember Sol?

11:29.898 --> 11:31.733
You mean the loud Jew from the law firm?

11:32.442 --> 11:37.405
You usually mention he's also tall,
but, yes, that's the one.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.698
What about him?

11:39.574 --> 11:41.117
He's the one I married.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.078
What are you talking about?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.831
I married Sol.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.168
Oh-ho.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.754
-This is because of Grace, isn't it?
-What?

11:52.837 --> 11:56.883
So you married the wrong woman,
but that doesn't mean that you're--

11:56.966 --> 11:57.800
Gay.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.136
Yes, it does.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.139
I am gay.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.310
And a man named Sol Bergstein
is the love of my life.

12:08.311 --> 12:11.272
And now I'm lucky enough
to call him my husband.

12:12.023 --> 12:15.902
I probably should have started
with the "I'm gay" thing,

12:15.985 --> 12:17.612
but I thought if I...

12:19.197 --> 12:24.118
mentioned the "I married a man" thing
it would clue you right in.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.126
Aren't you going to say anything?

12:32.710 --> 12:34.295
What do you want me to say?

12:34.879 --> 12:35.964
You know...

12:36.756 --> 12:37.840
You're happy for me?

12:40.301 --> 12:41.594
Fine. I'm happy for you.

12:47.225 --> 12:51.104
What? You surely weren't expecting
some kind of blessing for this.

12:51.688 --> 12:52.689
No.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.440
But I...

12:55.858 --> 12:58.361
was kind of hoping you'd surprise me.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.697
Surprise? I don't do that.

13:05.535 --> 13:09.080
He is really a wonderful man.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.125
He's everything to me.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.339
Well, you know,
you are just like your father.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.966
Gay?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.551
Selfish.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.262
You were always a selfish boy.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.973
Now, I see you've grown
into a selfish man.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.434
Really?

13:29.517 --> 13:34.397
I could have happily died never knowing
that you were one of them.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.026
I see.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.570
Goodbye.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.573
Robert?

13:45.742 --> 13:46.576
Yes?

13:47.535 --> 13:50.580
Why don't you take that Kindle thing
with you. I'm never going to use it.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.179
Hey, love.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.807
Just wanting to know how it went,
and hoping you're doing all right.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.184
Let me know--

14:11.267 --> 14:14.562
Oh, hang on. The other line is ringing.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.318
Hey, hang on one second.
I'm on the other line.

14:20.401 --> 14:23.613
I'll call you back. Or you call me back.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.785
-Sorry about that, Frankie.
-It's the other one.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.078
Oh.

14:31.329 --> 14:36.292
Hi, Grace. Robert's not here.
He drove up north to visit Cruella de Vil.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.920
She's your mother-in-law now. Enjoy.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.296
Thanks.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.215
Actually, I'm calling for you.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.591
Oh, okay.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.095
Have you seen Frankie by any chance?

14:47.178 --> 14:48.971
No. Is everything okay?

14:49.055 --> 14:50.556
Uh, yes. Fine.

14:50.640 --> 14:55.395
It's just, um... she left at noon
and I haven't seen her all day.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.230
When was the last time she checked in?

14:57.313 --> 15:00.274
She, um... she hasn't checked in.

15:00.358 --> 15:05.947
Huh. I mean, she once checked in
from the back of a minivan I was driving.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.698
I know.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.118
-Did something happen?
<i>-We had a fight.</i>

15:10.201 --> 15:14.831
I mean, nothing crazy, but just our usual
odd couple shenanigans.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.750
She seemed especially heated, though.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.711
Must have been. She didn't even call me
to complain about you.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.463
<i>Did you call the boys?</i>

15:22.547 --> 15:26.509
Yeah, and they've already called
all the Del Tacos. Nothing.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.970
How about the "Find My iPhone" app?

15:29.053 --> 15:33.891
Did that. The man at the gas station who's
had it for a week wasn't very helpful.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.810
Maybe she's with Jacob?

15:35.893 --> 15:38.771
No, he's out of town
and I'm out of places.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.106
<i>Do you want me to come over?</i>

15:40.189 --> 15:41.858
<i>Sol, that's not necessary.</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:44.444
Stay there. I'll be right over.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.778
<i>No, Sol--</i>

15:48.698 --> 15:52.118
Why did Dad just send us a text
saying he loves us unconditionally?

15:52.201 --> 15:55.079
Hmm. Must be enjoying Scotch O'clock.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.747
On that note...

15:59.959 --> 16:01.836
-Later, skater.
-Where are you going?

16:01.919 --> 16:04.005
It's the perfect time to leave.
I'm drunk enough to take an Uber,

16:04.088 --> 16:06.674
but not drunk enough
to flash the Uber driver.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.260
Last time I did it, the lady got real mad.

16:09.343 --> 16:12.180
No! No, no, you can't go.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.557
Mitch hasn't been punished
nearly long enough.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.603
When I told him I was going out, he asked
if that meant he had to "babysit."

16:18.686 --> 16:21.898
Babysit. His own kids.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.943
This seems like a nuanced argument
where both sides are dumb.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.070
Okay...

16:28.154 --> 16:29.822
Oh, sorry to reach over you like that.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.576
-It's cool.
-Reach all you want.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.996
Another round, please.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.753
Did you call the people
in her Tuvan throat singing group?

16:43.836 --> 16:48.090
Yeah, I tried. It might shock you to hear
that a bunch of Sherpas don't have phones.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.092
How mad was she when she left?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.220
Oh, you know, maddish.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.932
Mad.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.475
Real mad.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.185
What did you do, Grace?

16:59.268 --> 17:02.939
Nothing! I didn't do anything.
It was a misunderstanding.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.232
What was the misunderstanding?

17:05.483 --> 17:08.486
I have a gun
and she misunderstood that I have one.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.197
Oh...

17:11.280 --> 17:14.158
Nobody hates guns as much as she does.

17:14.242 --> 17:17.370
Coyote had to stop running track
because Frankie would get so upset

17:17.453 --> 17:19.121
every time the starter pistol went off.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.707
And your solution was
to have him quit the track team?

17:23.084 --> 17:24.669
Wow.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.629
That explains so much.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.882
To be honest, he was getting
a lot of participation ribbons, too.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.343
Judases!

17:32.426 --> 17:34.470
Frankie, thank God.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.889
The two great betrayers.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.892
Are you having a betrayer's dinner?
Do you have a club?

17:39.976 --> 17:41.852
We were worried about you!

17:41.936 --> 17:45.606
Oh, now you're worried. When a bullet
is whizzing by my head, nothing.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.442
But I hang out a few hours
with my yogurt-shop friends

17:48.526 --> 17:50.695
and now your concern kicks in.

17:50.778 --> 17:54.323
-I forgot to call her yogurt-shop friends.
-Did she tell you she shot at me?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.993
You shot at her with a gun?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.452
I shot a dummy!

17:58.536 --> 17:59.912
Are you carrying now?

17:59.996 --> 18:01.831
-Sol, pat her down.
-Ah!

18:02.498 --> 18:07.211
I only came back to find out
if that repulsive implement of death

18:07.295 --> 18:08.796
is out of my house yet.

18:08.879 --> 18:12.174
It happens to be our house and no.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.759
You have to get rid of it!

18:13.843 --> 18:17.096
Why? Because you say so?
You are unbelievable.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.474
Miss Trust-Circle-Talking-Stick
won't even entertain

18:20.558 --> 18:22.435
having a real conversation about this.

18:22.518 --> 18:28.274
There's nothing to say about it,
Miss Gun-Circle... Shoot... Stick.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.735
Eloquent rebuttal. You see?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.820
-Why do you even have a gun?
-Robert gave it to me.

18:32.903 --> 18:36.073
Robert gave it to you?
Oh, no. Is there one in our house?

18:36.157 --> 18:36.991
No!

18:37.074 --> 18:40.453
Sol, could we focus on the gun
in my house right now?

18:40.536 --> 18:44.415
Right, right. Okay, okay,
perhaps there's a compromise--

18:44.498 --> 18:45.791
How is there a compromise?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.668
I keep the gun here three days a week?

18:47.752 --> 18:49.754
She shoots half a round into the sofa?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.714
You see how she exaggerates?

18:51.797 --> 18:54.759
You see how she tries to dehumanize me
with the third person?

18:54.842 --> 18:58.387
Did you ever consider for one minute
that that gun is for your safety, too?

18:58.471 --> 19:02.892
You were the one that was so scared
and wanting to be protected!

19:06.145 --> 19:08.272
What fresh hippie hell is this?

19:08.356 --> 19:11.067
She used to do this at town meetings.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.902
It's her form of a filibuster.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.909
She could go on for a while.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.335
Thank you very much for the drink.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.462
I'm Ryan, by the way.

19:32.797 --> 19:33.839
Hello, Ryan.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.968
Evidently, I couldn't help myself.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.971
You seemed like a Manhattan man.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.182
Well, I do love a maraschino cherry

19:43.265 --> 19:45.226
and this is the manliest way
to eat one in public.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.479
Why don't you join me?

19:49.438 --> 19:53.234
Uh, maybe later. I just have to go
talk to my sister in an angry whisper.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.323
Why did I just buy
square-jawed-Ryan a drink?

19:59.407 --> 20:02.451
Because we think he's handsome
and we might want to get gross with him.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.537
-We?
-You.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.746
Just gross with you.

20:05.830 --> 20:10.292
I don't have the energy
for charming, flirty conversation.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.795
And also I had barbecue for lunch.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.549
He is so handsome. And did you smell him?

20:16.632 --> 20:20.636
It was like a vintage leather club chair,
and lemons,

20:20.720 --> 20:25.433
and strong, calloused hands working
their way around a woman's body.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.769
Okay, I'm switching this out for water.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.485
You're chasing a vodka martini with vodka?
Are you insane?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.488
-You can't handle a "Grace Hanson."
-I'm having fun!

20:39.572 --> 20:43.951
Since when is your idea of fun
getting drunk and sniffing some guy?

20:44.034 --> 20:46.787
You do realize you have
a husband waiting for you at home.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.832
You know what's waiting for me?

20:49.915 --> 20:53.127
Mitch just texts that Maisy,
you know, our girl baby?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.796
I know who she is.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.214
She shit all over our bed.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.967
He wants me to come home
because he doesn't know what to do.

21:00.050 --> 21:04.638
a shit-covered bed
and a man who can't figure out laundry.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.808
Don't go. Get a room here for the night.
Make him clean it up.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.394
You don't get it.
I always have to clean it up.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.688
I really hope that's metaphorical.

21:13.439 --> 21:17.318
You're so lucky, you don't even know.
You have all this freedom.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.196
That freedom's been
a real boon to me lately.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.531
But at least you get to do what you want.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.700
I don't know what I want.
I only know what I don't want.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.243
But you're not trapped.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.247
You feel like you're trapped?

21:33.042 --> 21:34.668
I don't know.

21:34.752 --> 21:35.961
Sometimes.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.172
Lately...

21:38.255 --> 21:42.051
I just-- I feel like there aren't
a lot of surprises for me down the road.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.346
You know, my kids will grow up,
they'll move away,

21:45.429 --> 21:46.806
I'll become a grandmother.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.809
I'll get my face done,
my grandkids will graduate from college,

21:49.892 --> 21:53.145
I'll get my face redone,
and then I'll die.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.438
I mean, that's silly.

21:54.522 --> 21:58.275
We'll all be dead from loose nukes
long before most of that stuff happens.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.735
You think?

21:59.819 --> 22:02.238
And I don't think you're trapped.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.115
Who are you kidding?
You would hate my life.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.659
Oh, for sure.

22:07.368 --> 22:11.038
But, I mean, you've always wanted a family
and now you have one.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.623
Yeah.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.961
Mitch just texted again. I have to go.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.629
-Listen...
-No...

22:18.712 --> 22:21.382
All I'm saying is, you still have choices.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.300
And if you get to choose...

22:26.971 --> 22:27.846
choose that.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.433
I love you.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.227
I love you.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.772
-I'm just gonna...
-Okay.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.274
-That just--
-Mmm!

22:38.357 --> 22:40.609
Jesus, Mal. What is going on?

22:41.402 --> 22:44.280
It went everywhere. It went everywhere.

23:06.844 --> 23:10.139
Frankie, come to the shooting range
with me and you'll see how safe it is.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.475
Jacob! Ah!

23:15.019 --> 23:17.354
Oh, thank heavens you're back!

23:18.856 --> 23:22.192
Yes, I flew back
in a plane to the airport.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.153
I know how planes work.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.697
Do you know how picking people up
from the airport works?

23:26.780 --> 23:30.159
I was supposed to pick you up.
I'm so sorry.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.787
It's cool. I was just worried when
you didn't show up or answer your phone.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.957
It was a day of worry
for all of us, Jacob.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.251
Oh, hey, Sol.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.920
Why were you guys worried?

23:42.004 --> 23:44.465
Because last night
I was gunned down in effigy,

23:44.548 --> 23:47.885
and now Annie Oakley refuses
to give up her kill stick.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.262
I might be missing
a few pieces of this story.

23:50.346 --> 23:53.766
-Grace has a gun.
-And...?

23:53.849 --> 23:55.559
Grace has a gun.

23:55.643 --> 23:58.187
That's... terrible?

23:58.854 --> 24:02.024
You should get rid of that... gun.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.152
Why are you pausing weirdly?

24:05.736 --> 24:07.696
I'm not... pausing.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.907
Oh, yeah. I just heard it.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.742
This is important, Jacob.

24:11.825 --> 24:16.413
I know you're okay with a bow and arrow,
are you okay with handguns?

24:17.456 --> 24:19.249
Can I make myself a sandwich or something?

24:19.333 --> 24:22.544
No, no, no, wait a minute.
I'm interested to hear your view on this.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.838
Seriously, they don't feed you
on the plane.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.758
-Now, in the old days they used to--
-Jacob!

24:29.468 --> 24:32.763
All right, fine. I worry about you two
living alone out here.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.390
Especially after that break-in.

24:34.473 --> 24:38.977
So maybe it's not such a bad thing
that Grace has a gun.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.647
-Thank you!
-No "thank you"!

24:41.730 --> 24:43.482
I can't believe this.

24:43.565 --> 24:47.861
There's only so many betrayals
I can take during a 24-hour period.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.488
Fuck all y'alls!

24:49.571 --> 24:51.990
What did I do? I'm not one of the y'alls.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.617
Oh, you're a "y'all," Sol.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.413
I'm sorry, Frankie,
but you asked for my opinion.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.456
No, don't say you're sorry.
You're just being honest.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.625
Don't defend my boyfriend.

25:01.709 --> 25:05.838
Well, somebody has to. You're biting
his head off. After all he's done for us?

25:06.588 --> 25:07.506
What have I done?

25:07.589 --> 25:09.174
Oh, are you kidding?

25:09.258 --> 25:11.385
Enough to deserve that sandwich.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.012
-Go make yourself a sammy!
-I'll make sandwiches.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.848
No! He can make his own sandwich!

25:15.931 --> 25:17.725
Why should he make his own sandwich?

25:17.808 --> 25:21.937
- A guy that's loaned us $75,000?
- What?

25:22.020 --> 25:24.898
Well, I know I'm not supposed
to say anything--

25:24.982 --> 25:26.191
Then don't!

25:26.275 --> 25:30.904
Everybody but Grace go in the kitchen
and get yourself a sandwich!

25:30.988 --> 25:32.656
Frankie, what's going on here?

25:35.617 --> 25:39.121
Jacob, did you loan us $75,000?

25:39.204 --> 25:40.581
I did not.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.707
What?!

25:41.790 --> 25:43.167
Oh, boy.

25:47.629 --> 25:48.964
Um...

25:52.926 --> 25:55.387
So how did you do that thing
with the cherry stem?

25:58.265 --> 26:01.894
I tied it with my hands and popped it
in my mouth when you weren't looking.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.687
Impressive.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.860
It's gonna be $300 for tonight.
Is that okay?

26:12.029 --> 26:14.656
You're funny.
And you do smell good, like...

26:16.283 --> 26:18.285
bourbon and fancy soap.

26:18.368 --> 26:22.289
Hmm, I'm not joking, $300 for the night.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.961
-What?
-I'm an escort.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.547
What?

26:30.631 --> 26:34.760
I thought you got the gist before
when I said, "$50 to make you holler."

26:35.552 --> 26:40.933
Um, no, I thought that was
just an odd shout-out to Tone Lōc.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.685
I'm sorry. I thought you understood
what was happening here.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.230
I did not.

26:48.106 --> 26:51.652
Oh, my apologies. I'd better be going.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.614
Again, I'm sorry for the confusion.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.160
Um...

27:01.662 --> 27:07.084
Just out of curiosity, what happens
when someone says, "I can't do this"?

27:07.668 --> 27:11.255
Well, then I take off my shirt
and ask, "Are you sure?"

27:16.593 --> 27:17.970
I can't do this.

27:32.734 --> 27:33.944
Are you sure?

27:39.992 --> 27:40.868
You're back.

27:40.951 --> 27:41.827
Hey.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.371
-How'd it go?
-Good.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.332
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.793
She took it far better than I expected.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.170
Sends her love to you.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.171
Said she's sorry
about all the awful things

27:53.255 --> 27:55.299
she said about Grace and Bill Clinton.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.926
I think she's knitting us
a wedding blanket as we speak.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.220
Oh, sweetheart.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.057
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

28:04.141 --> 28:05.475
No, it's not.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.561
Hey, it's what it is.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.190
For what it's worth, I'm proud of you.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.737
I think what you did was very brave.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.240
What is, breaking the heart
of a 90-year-old woman?

28:20.324 --> 28:23.201
It's sweet that you still think
she has a heart.

28:23.285 --> 28:27.331
I'm just surprised that she can
still muster up enough energy to be--

28:27.414 --> 28:29.207
Her.

28:29.291 --> 28:33.712
Tell you what, if my mom were still alive,
she'd bake you a blintz casserole,

28:33.795 --> 28:35.881
kiss you on the head,
and tell you you're wonderful.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.508
Ooh, so I can eat blintz casserole now?

28:38.592 --> 28:40.510
Absolutely not.

28:44.431 --> 28:45.265
But...

28:50.729 --> 28:52.231
you are wonderful.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.735
You hypocrite!

28:56.818 --> 28:59.404
You can't compare having a secret gun

28:59.488 --> 29:01.823
to getting us a secret benefactor!

29:01.907 --> 29:03.700
This was a good lie.

29:03.784 --> 29:07.204
Like when I told Sol it was
perfectly normal for an adult man

29:07.287 --> 29:08.747
to like marionette theater.

29:08.830 --> 29:12.251
Okay, first of all, that is a bad lie.

29:12.334 --> 29:16.588
Second of all, you went
behind my back to my daughter!

29:16.672 --> 29:18.298
I don't know what your problem is.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.550
I wouldn't be mad at you
if you went to Coyote.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.345
So he could write
one of his homemade checks?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.099
-You know what?
-What?

29:27.182 --> 29:30.310
I'm sick of you saying
terrible things about my kids.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.856
I'm sick of you telling me what
I'm allowed to pitch at the incubator

29:34.940 --> 29:36.858
and what time I have to have breakfast

29:36.942 --> 29:39.361
and whether or not
there's a gun in my house!

29:39.444 --> 29:41.363
I'm sick of all of it!

29:41.446 --> 29:43.198
I'm sick of you.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.700
I'm out of here.

29:45.993 --> 29:46.994
Until you come back.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.037
Don't hold your breath.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.215
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
