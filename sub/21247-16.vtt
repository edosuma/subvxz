They're going after some
pangolins on the Chakula Plains!

The Chakula Plains?
That's a long way's away.

01:38.324 --> 01:42.342

Can't you use the Roar?

02:37.549 --> 02:39.658
That was weird. They just quit.

It's a good thing.
They had us way outnumbered.

I was the fastest!

where they're going?

05:12.962 --> 05:15.038
Affirmative.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.316
They appear to be heading
for the Outlands!

Looks like the jackals
are back in the Outlands.

05:32.558 --> 05:34.224
Hyenas, too.

05:34.226 --> 05:38.486
You think it's weird? Both of them
attacking at the exact same time?

05:38.564 --> 05:41.489
Yeah. And let's hope
it never happens again.

05:41.567 --> 05:44.009
It split us up. And when
we split up, we're weaker.

05:44.086 --> 05:45.752
Hey, it all worked out!

05:45.829 --> 05:49.681
We still saved all the animals and
chased the bad guys away, right?

05:49.758 --> 05:52.242
Twiga and Juhudi
saved themselves.

05:52.244 --> 05:53.668
And then the hyenas just left.

05:53.745 --> 05:56.262
Same thing happened with
the pangolins and the jackals.

05:56.339 --> 05:57.339
Hmm.

05:58.250 --> 06:02.527
Don't worry, Kion. Maybe
it was just a coincidence.

06:02.604 --> 06:04.437
Oh, no. I don't think it was...

06:07.926 --> 06:12.687
The hyenas and jackals are heading
across the Outlands together!

06:12.764 --> 06:14.539
Together? But they don't
even like each other!

06:14.616 --> 06:18.693
Indeed. Hyenas have even
been known to hunt jackals.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.453
Bleurgh. Who'd want
to eat jackals?

06:22.290 --> 06:25.032
Then that means the attacks
weren't a coincidence!

06:25.110 --> 06:26.793
They must be working together!

06:26.870 --> 06:28.220
Why would they do that?

06:28.296 --> 06:32.132
To split us up! That way,
they both had us outnumbered!

06:32.208 --> 06:35.727
And if they did it once,
they might do it again.

06:35.804 --> 06:37.287
If you're right,
what are we going to do?

06:37.289 --> 06:40.957
Easy! We just have to be
in two places at once!

06:40.959 --> 06:41.959
Seriously?

06:43.128 --> 06:45.404
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

06:45.480 --> 06:49.557
Two places at once? Kion, how
can we possibly do that?

06:49.635 --> 06:52.077
With a little help, that's how!

06:52.154 --> 06:54.821
(ALL LAUGHING)

06:54.898 --> 06:56.656
It's like I'm talking to myself!

06:56.733 --> 07:00.919
It sure is! And you thought only
zebras could sound this silly!

07:00.996 --> 07:02.412
(ALL LAUGH)

07:04.316 --> 07:05.982
I do sound silly! (LAUGHS)

07:05.984 --> 07:08.075
Do you think
you can sound like me?

07:08.153 --> 07:12.172
Of course, I can! But do you think
you can hear me way up there?

07:12.248 --> 07:14.157
Oh, delightful!

07:14.159 --> 07:15.159
KION: How about me, Tamaa?

07:16.511 --> 07:17.919
Can you still sound like me?

07:17.996 --> 07:19.587
Uh, Kion.

07:19.665 --> 07:22.348
This isn't what it looks like!
Er... sounds like!

07:22.425 --> 07:24.425
Oh, yeah? What is it?

07:24.503 --> 07:26.111
My life of crime is over!

07:26.188 --> 07:28.688
I don't imitate animals to trick
them out of their food anymore.

07:30.509 --> 07:35.195
These days I do it to make 'em laugh
and they just give me their food!

07:35.271 --> 07:37.456
We certainly do!

07:37.532 --> 07:39.958
Hear that? They certainly do!

07:40.035 --> 07:42.852
(ANIMALS LAUGH)

07:42.854 --> 07:45.112
(CHUCKLES) He is pretty funny.

07:45.190 --> 07:46.873
Yeah, I think so, too.

07:46.950 --> 07:50.135
(ALL LAUGH)

07:50.212 --> 07:52.712
I'm glad to hear
you kept your promise, Tamaa.

07:52.789 --> 07:54.714
But we're not here
to check up on you.

07:54.791 --> 07:56.366
We need your help.

07:56.368 --> 07:58.626
The Lion Guard needs my help?

07:58.704 --> 08:00.720
Little old me? Tamaa the Drongo?

08:03.041 --> 08:04.265
Sorry, everybody! Show's over!

08:05.969 --> 08:07.319
Ta-ta.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.303
(IMITATES THURSTON) Ta-ta.

08:09.381 --> 08:11.973
(LAUGHS) I just said
ta-ta to me!

08:12.050 --> 08:13.733
(LAUGHS)

08:13.810 --> 08:17.887
So what's up, kids? You need
entertainment for a party at Pride Rock?

08:17.889 --> 08:19.498
I've got Simba's voice down
pretty good!

08:19.574 --> 08:21.741
(INHALES) No, that's not it.

08:21.818 --> 08:23.226
This is something serious.

08:23.228 --> 08:25.411
Really? Huh.

08:25.488 --> 08:27.397
I usually do comedy, but okay.

08:27.399 --> 08:31.234
Remember how you scared the
hyenas by imitating our voices?

08:31.236 --> 08:36.072
Hey, I only did that because I had no
choice. But no disrespect intended.

08:36.074 --> 08:38.091
Yeah. Well, we want you
to do it again.

08:39.244 --> 08:40.167
All I can say is...

08:40.245 --> 08:42.579
(IMITATES BUNGA) <i>Zuka Zama!</i>

08:42.581 --> 08:43.781
This guy is un-Bunga-lievable!

08:49.087 --> 08:50.770
So what's the plan?

08:50.847 --> 08:52.416
I imitate your voices
to distract the bad guys

08:52.440 --> 08:53.800
while you jump
on them from behind?

08:53.850 --> 08:55.608
Not exactly.

08:55.685 --> 08:58.928
You're going to imitate our voices,
but we're not going to be there.

08:58.930 --> 09:02.949
Now let me get this straight.
You're not going to be there.

09:03.026 --> 09:04.617
But the bad guys will be?

09:04.694 --> 09:06.452
Oh, sure! A whole bunch of 'em!

09:06.529 --> 09:08.288
Hyenas, jackals. Not sure which.

09:08.364 --> 09:11.866
You do remember that the last time I
almost ended up as hyena food, right?

09:11.943 --> 09:14.886
Don't worry, Tamaa. We won't
let anything happen to you.

09:14.963 --> 09:16.555
Really? You promise?

09:16.631 --> 09:21.059
I think a clever bird like you
should be able to handle himself.

09:21.136 --> 09:23.228
Yeah. We're just dealing
with jackals and hyenas.

09:23.305 --> 09:24.305
Not somebody smart.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.065
JANJA: The plan worked, Scar.

09:27.142 --> 09:28.716
The Lion Guard
split up to chase us!

09:28.794 --> 09:30.476
Just like you said they would!

09:30.553 --> 09:32.737
That's right. (LAUGHS)

09:32.814 --> 09:34.239
We had 'em chasing
their own tails.

09:34.316 --> 09:36.408
Excellent.

09:36.484 --> 09:37.484
Yeah, yeah! But, uh...

09:37.560 --> 09:39.727
Why'd we go to all that trouble?

09:39.805 --> 09:41.395
We still came back with nothin'!

09:41.473 --> 09:43.898
These first attacks
were merely a test

09:43.975 --> 09:45.615
to see if Kion
would react as I predicted.

09:45.735 --> 09:49.813
The next attack is
the one that counts.

09:49.815 --> 09:53.240
Because next time your target
will be Rafiki!

09:53.318 --> 09:55.335
Rafiki?

09:55.411 --> 09:57.429
You want to get rid of
that old monkey?

09:57.505 --> 10:00.098
That "old monkey" is dangerous.

10:00.175 --> 10:05.178
He has the ability to sense
the Lions of the Past.

10:05.254 --> 10:08.440
Ooh, ooh! That means
he can sense you!

10:08.516 --> 10:12.093
Amazingly, you're right.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.406
And I don't want anyone in the Pride
Lands to know I've returned...

10:14.430 --> 10:16.597
At least, not yet!

10:16.675 --> 10:21.027
Okay. Me and my boys
will head to Rafiki's Tree.

10:21.104 --> 10:22.581
Reirei's jackals
can distract the Guard

10:22.605 --> 10:25.181
by goin' after some
zebras or somethin'.

10:25.183 --> 10:26.683
I think my pack
should eliminate Rafiki

10:26.685 --> 10:30.111
while you fur-brains go after
something you can handle,

10:30.188 --> 10:31.946
like a couple of grass rats!

10:32.023 --> 10:34.299
We'll deal with Rafiki!

10:34.376 --> 10:37.026
You don't send a jackal
to do a hyena's job!

10:37.028 --> 10:38.452
SCAR: Enough!

10:38.530 --> 10:41.047
Janja, you can have Rafiki.

10:41.124 --> 10:44.050
Reirei, the jackals
can take lead next time.

10:44.127 --> 10:45.869
Humph.

10:45.871 --> 10:50.206
But the skinks have informed me
that Rafiki is not at his tree

10:50.208 --> 10:53.467
He's near Mapango Cliffs
meditating.

10:53.545 --> 10:55.302
Oh, okay, Scar. Don't worry.

10:55.380 --> 11:00.400
We'll find him. If Reirei can keep
half of the Lion Guard away from him.

11:00.476 --> 11:03.553
We jackals always do our job.

11:03.555 --> 11:05.571
Then Rafiki'll never know
what hit him.

11:05.648 --> 11:07.390
Good.

11:07.392 --> 11:10.151
Then proceed with the plan.

11:10.228 --> 11:13.062
Divide... And conquer!

11:13.064 --> 11:15.123
(LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY)

11:17.493 --> 11:21.905
Ya hear that, Reirei? Scar's
lettin' me take care of Rafiki!

11:21.907 --> 11:23.998
'Cause us hyenas are smarter!

11:24.075 --> 11:27.185
Smarter than who? A grub worm?

11:27.262 --> 11:29.521
Smarter than you, that's who!

11:29.597 --> 11:31.931
Don't make me laugh, Janja.

11:32.008 --> 11:33.858
We Jackals are
the smartest animals around.

11:38.681 --> 11:44.035
<i>♪ Yes, us Jackals
Are as smart as they come</i>

11:44.112 --> 11:46.705
<i>♪ If you want somebody clever</i>

11:46.781 --> 11:48.598
<i>♪ We are number one</i>
