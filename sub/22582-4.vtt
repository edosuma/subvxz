WEBVTT

00:04.807 --> 00:07.002
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

00:07.127 --> 00:10.802
It's been almost four days since
the incident in the Romulan minefield.

00:10.927 --> 00:13.282
Repair teams have been working
around-the-clock.

00:13.407 --> 00:15.125
Nerves are definitely frayed.

00:15.247 --> 00:17.636
It's incredible we're still in one piece.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.520
If that mine had hit
another metre to the left...

00:21.047 --> 00:24.835
We can't polarise the port bow plating
until those breaches are sealed.

00:26.487 --> 00:27.920
What's your guess?

00:28.047 --> 00:30.436
Assuming we can find
some tritanium alloy?

00:32.647 --> 00:34.160
Three or four months.

00:35.167 --> 00:38.125
And with this kind of damage,
the best I can give you is...

00:38.247 --> 00:40.715
Warp 2, maybe 2.1.

00:43.287 --> 00:44.879
In other words...

00:46.527 --> 00:48.916
we're a decade away
from Jupiter Station.

00:53.647 --> 00:55.683
What about the transceiver array?

00:55.807 --> 00:59.117
The subspace antenna's damaged.
All we've got is short-range.

01:00.807 --> 01:03.844
We've answered enough calls for help
over the past year.

01:04.047 --> 01:06.277
It's time someone returned the favour.

01:07.447 --> 01:08.562
You serious?

01:13.247 --> 01:14.680
Archer to Ensign Sato.

01:14.807 --> 01:16.001
Go ahead, sir.

01:16.607 --> 01:20.361
I want you to get started on
a general distress call.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.800
Assistance required.

01:23.087 --> 01:25.442
Minor repairs.
Don't go into too much detail.

01:25.567 --> 01:28.479
- Understood, sir.
- Archer out.

01:34.767 --> 01:37.327
It's been a long road

01:38.967 --> 01:42.004
Gettin' from there to here

01:42.127 --> 01:44.925
It's been a long time

01:45.727 --> 01:49.197
But my time is finally near

01:49.687 --> 01:53.077
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:53.807 --> 01:56.640
I will touch the sky

01:57.167 --> 02:00.796
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:00.927 --> 02:03.919
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:04.047 --> 02:08.324
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:08.487 --> 02:11.559
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:11.687 --> 02:15.839
I've got faith to believe

02:15.967 --> 02:18.925
I can do anything

02:19.047 --> 02:22.756
I've got strength of the soul

02:23.367 --> 02:26.359
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:26.487 --> 02:30.685
I can reach any star

02:31.847 --> 02:33.838
I've got faith

02:35.687 --> 02:38.804
I've got faith

02:39.367 --> 02:42.643
Faith of the heart

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.247 --> 02:57.556
You're killing me!

02:57.887 --> 03:00.765
Push, Lieutenant. Two more seconds.

03:01.647 --> 03:02.636
And rest.

03:05.887 --> 03:08.845
It can't be ethical to cause a patient
this much pain.

03:09.487 --> 03:13.480
It's unethical to harm a patient.
I can inflict as much pain as I like.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.480
A positive attitude is vital
to the healing process.

03:16.607 --> 03:20.156
The more you complain,
the longer your recovery is likely to take.

03:21.247 --> 03:23.477
When will I be able to return to duty?

03:23.607 --> 03:26.405
- Another week, possibly two.
- Two weeks?

03:26.527 --> 03:28.119
Attitude, Lieutenant.

03:28.607 --> 03:31.075
Your wound might heal faster
if you allow me to apply...

03:31.207 --> 03:32.435
a few more Regulan Blood Worms.

03:32.567 --> 03:35.240
You're not putting any more
of those things inside my leg.

03:35.367 --> 03:37.005
You still haven't found the last one.

03:37.127 --> 03:39.800
He'll come out on his own, eventually.

03:46.247 --> 03:47.646
Did you hear that?

03:50.007 --> 03:51.440
I don't believe it.

03:52.087 --> 03:54.123
Trip told me he fixed that squeak.

03:56.167 --> 03:57.156
Go ahead.

03:57.287 --> 04:00.404
Captain, we're receiving a response
to the distress call.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.841
- It's a Tellarite freighter.
- Put them through.

04:11.407 --> 04:13.637
This is Captain Archer
of the Starship Enterprise.

04:13.767 --> 04:16.759
- Thank you for responding.
- How may we be of assistance?

04:18.367 --> 04:20.322
We need help in repairing
some hull damage.

04:20.447 --> 04:23.803
If you can rendezvous with us,
we'd be happy to discuss...

04:24.127 --> 04:26.846
Schedule won't permit it.
The signal is...

04:28.887 --> 04:31.355
I'm sorry, sir.
They're barely within range.

04:31.487 --> 04:32.920
Can you repeat?

04:33.687 --> 04:35.279
Transmitting coordinates.

04:35.407 --> 04:37.159
Repair station at...

04:39.927 --> 04:42.202
Sounded like he said "repair station"?

04:42.327 --> 04:44.443
We've received a set of coordinates.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.205
What do you know
about these Tellarites?

04:46.327 --> 04:50.161
They're not the most agreeable species,
but they're usually trustworthy.

04:50.527 --> 04:53.724
The coordinates are
three-and-a-half days away at warp 2.

04:57.767 --> 05:00.156
- I think it's worth a look.
- Aye, sir.

05:08.047 --> 05:10.322
This is Captain Archer
of the Starship Enterprise.

05:10.447 --> 05:12.039
We need to make some repairs.

05:12.167 --> 05:14.601
I was told you might be willing
to help us.

05:21.287 --> 05:25.326
We'd be grateful for any assistance
you could offer. Please respond.

05:31.647 --> 05:34.081
- Nothing.
- Bio-signs?

05:34.847 --> 05:37.805
- None that I can detect.
- Maybe it's abandoned.

05:38.327 --> 05:40.318
We might be able to board it.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.037
Salvage some of the materials we need.

05:43.167 --> 05:46.762
Doesn't seem that Enterprise
could fit inside those docking berths.

05:48.887 --> 05:50.605
What's it look like inside?

05:52.527 --> 05:54.836
I'm detecting
a liquid helium atmosphere.

05:55.687 --> 05:58.406
The temperature's 270 degrees
below zero.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.756
- A bio-molecular probe.
- Sir.

06:22.327 --> 06:25.399
It's reconfiguring
to fit the saucer section.

06:27.327 --> 06:31.525
The liquid helium is being replaced by
a warmer oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.

06:31.647 --> 06:33.558
Still no response to our hails.

06:35.727 --> 06:38.116
It appears an invitation's been extended.

06:38.487 --> 06:41.160
They need to work a little
on their hospitality.

06:43.927 --> 06:46.316
I don't see that we have a lot of options.

06:49.087 --> 06:50.236
Take us in.

08:09.007 --> 08:12.716
They've isolated every hull breach,
every damaged system.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.320
I'll be damned.

08:17.887 --> 08:20.401
We scratched the hull right there
a year ago.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.527
I bumped it with the inspection pod,
remember?

08:23.967 --> 08:26.527
I thought I told you
to have that repainted.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.925
I was getting around to it.

08:37.087 --> 08:38.679
Everything's in English.

08:46.647 --> 08:49.081
The ship wasn't the only thing
they probed.

08:50.087 --> 08:51.725
I think that's Malcolm.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.797
That's where his left leg was injured.

08:56.887 --> 09:00.482
This facility may have the technology
to repair Mr. Reed as well.

09:03.087 --> 09:05.442
The analysis of your vessel is complete.

09:05.687 --> 09:08.963
Select a method of compensation
to begin the repair process.

09:11.407 --> 09:15.320
- Who am I speaking with?
- Your inquiry was not recognised.

09:17.127 --> 09:19.482
Is there someone here
I can speak with?

09:20.007 --> 09:22.043
Your inquiry was not recognised.

09:22.287 --> 09:24.881
I don't think there's anyone back there.

09:25.527 --> 09:27.483
Perhaps the station's automated.

09:29.487 --> 09:32.206
Are you saying you can repair
all our systems?

09:32.887 --> 09:35.640
Select a method of compensation
to begin the repair process.

09:39.527 --> 09:41.324
We can give them either
three warp coils...

09:41.447 --> 09:43.085
five deuterium injectors...

09:43.207 --> 09:45.084
or 200 litres of warp plasma.

09:46.047 --> 09:49.517
I wouldn't recommend giving up
any hardware we can't replace.

09:49.647 --> 09:50.716
Plasma?

09:52.247 --> 09:53.919
I think we can spare it.

09:56.247 --> 09:59.398
If we agree to these terms,
how long will the repairs take?

09:59.527 --> 10:03.361
Time to completion: 34.2 Earth hours.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.917
I'm telling you,
the boys at Jupiter Station...

10:08.047 --> 10:09.639
would take three months.

10:10.487 --> 10:12.159
It's a fair exchange.

10:12.767 --> 10:16.157
Select a method of compensation
to begin the repair process.

10:28.887 --> 10:31.560
Compensation will be due
when the repairs are completed.

10:31.687 --> 10:33.803
Your vessel will then
disengage immediately.

10:33.927 --> 10:36.122
All personnel are required
to vacate areas...

10:36.247 --> 10:38.317
that are undergoing reconstruction.

10:38.767 --> 10:39.916
Look at this.

10:41.447 --> 10:43.085
It's our repair schedule.

10:43.647 --> 10:46.719
Transmit it to Hoshi
and have her inform the crew.

10:58.007 --> 11:00.396
- Enterprise to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.803
Some kind of mechanical arms
are being attached to the outer hull.

11:03.927 --> 11:05.918
It's all right, Travis. Stand by.

11:07.767 --> 11:11.123
The recreation facility
is now available to all personnel.

11:11.887 --> 11:13.445
Enjoy your visit.

11:45.567 --> 11:48.639
If this is their idea
of a recreation facility...

11:48.767 --> 11:51.122
we might want to ask
for our plasma back.

12:03.887 --> 12:05.559
A matter energy converter.

12:07.687 --> 12:09.359
It could be a transporter.

12:10.447 --> 12:12.119
An awfully small one.

12:13.087 --> 12:15.885
I believe it's a molecular synthesiser
of some kind.

12:16.007 --> 12:18.567
Similar to a protein resequencer,
but far more advanced.

12:18.687 --> 12:20.086
Water, cold.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.362
I saw a similar device
on a Tarkalean vessel.

12:37.487 --> 12:40.638
It was capable of replicating
almost any inanimate object.

12:41.007 --> 12:42.759
If we had one of these in Engineering...

12:42.887 --> 12:45.276
we could make
all the spare parts we need.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.803
I wonder what else is on the menu.

12:51.607 --> 12:53.245
One pan-fried catfish.

13:06.247 --> 13:07.965
Smells like the real thing.

13:14.567 --> 13:15.636
Well?

13:16.887 --> 13:17.956
Not bad.

13:19.247 --> 13:21.966
I doubt there's a catfish
within 130 light-years.

13:22.167 --> 13:25.603
Its genome is stored in
Enterprise's computer, as is the recipe.

13:26.927 --> 13:29.361
The station evidently
scanned our database.

13:32.767 --> 13:35.201
It would have been nice
to have been asked.

13:36.207 --> 13:38.960
I can only imagine what else
this thing knows about us.

13:39.087 --> 13:40.645
Captain, you've got to try this.

13:40.767 --> 13:43.645
Thanks, but I'll stick with
whatever Chef's serving.

13:44.167 --> 13:45.680
I'll be on the Bridge.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.600
Are you sure this thing knows
what it's doing?

14:09.767 --> 14:11.485
That's the third time you've asked.

14:11.607 --> 14:13.325
You didn't answer me
the first two times.

14:13.447 --> 14:17.122
It's remarkable. Your cells
are regenerating at an exponential rate.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.363
Do you see how it's using
a cytokinetic enzyme...

14:19.487 --> 14:21.000
to stimulate the cell division?

14:21.127 --> 14:24.039
- Lovely.
- I could certainly use a device like this.

14:25.007 --> 14:28.124
Perhaps the Captain could negotiate
a trade of some sort.

14:40.127 --> 14:42.083
The tissue is completely healed.

14:42.727 --> 14:45.446
Even the scar is gone. Try standing up.

14:50.447 --> 14:53.359
- Any pain?
- None.

14:57.607 --> 14:58.960
Come in.

15:02.047 --> 15:04.686
Repairs are currently underway
on C-Deck.

15:05.127 --> 15:08.403
Work on Launch Bay 1 is scheduled
to begin at 2200 hours.

15:11.567 --> 15:13.842
They even fixed the squeak in the floor.

15:15.487 --> 15:19.116
I was starting to wonder if we had
a gremlin under the deck plating.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.759
A mythical creature.

15:22.127 --> 15:25.836
British pilots used to blame them
for problems they couldn't explain.

15:26.047 --> 15:27.924
Perhaps I should scan for one.

15:28.807 --> 15:30.399
That won't be necessary.

15:31.607 --> 15:34.121
Is Trip happy
with how the repairs are going?

15:34.247 --> 15:36.522
He says they're exceeding
Starfleet specifications.

15:36.647 --> 15:38.080
That's good to hear.

15:38.727 --> 15:39.955
Anything else?

15:40.567 --> 15:42.922
- Lf I may make an observation?
- Go ahead.

15:43.367 --> 15:44.766
You seem troubled.

15:45.887 --> 15:49.163
I guess I need to do a better job
at repressing my emotions.

15:50.967 --> 15:52.764
These repairs
are one hell of a bargain...

15:52.887 --> 15:56.004
at only 200 litres of warp plasma,
don't you think?

15:56.447 --> 15:59.484
Not every culture is based
on the acquisition of wealth.

15:59.767 --> 16:03.760
The station's builders could simply
have been interested in helping others.

16:04.167 --> 16:05.680
What happened to them?

16:06.447 --> 16:10.326
They could have at least left
a message: "Thanks for stopping by."

16:10.447 --> 16:12.324
Perhaps they prefer anonymity.

16:14.527 --> 16:16.836
Don't you find that a little suspicious?

16:18.327 --> 16:21.797
I know you don't put a lot of faith
in your feelings...

16:23.327 --> 16:25.238
but I've learned to trust mine.

16:28.007 --> 16:29.838
Something doesn't smell right.

16:40.047 --> 16:42.686
Honestly, I started to feel
a little sorry for the doctor.

16:42.807 --> 16:46.356
There wasn't anything for him to do.
Stand there and watch this thing work.

16:46.487 --> 16:47.681
I know how he must have felt.

16:47.807 --> 16:51.846
I saw an entire transtator assembly
replaced in 15 minutes.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.242
It would have taken my crew a week.

16:55.607 --> 16:56.835
With this kind of technology...

16:56.967 --> 16:59.879
Starfleet could build ships
that maintain themselves.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.916
They wouldn't need chief engineers.
Or tactical officers.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.563
A starship without a tactical officer?

17:06.686 --> 17:08.405
I can't say I see the point.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.361
You'd think a computer that can do
all this would have to be pretty big.

17:12.487 --> 17:16.958
Our computer's the most advanced
in the fleet, and it's three decks high.

17:17.686 --> 17:19.279
I suppose you're right.

17:19.527 --> 17:20.925
So where is it?

17:22.686 --> 17:24.086
I don't follow.

17:25.007 --> 17:27.760
I ran a scan of the station
a few hours ago.

17:28.687 --> 17:31.565
These are the docking berths.
We're here.

17:32.127 --> 17:33.924
This is the Diagnostic Room.

17:37.847 --> 17:40.486
That compartment's the only place
it could be.

17:41.607 --> 17:44.041
But it's barely half the size of this one.

17:44.167 --> 17:47.921
A machine capable of billions
of calculations every nanosecond...

17:48.047 --> 17:51.960
and it can fit inside
the proverbial breadbox.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.918
I'd love to get a look at that.

17:56.407 --> 17:58.557
- You could always ask.
- I tried.

17:59.887 --> 18:02.321
"Your inquiry was not recognised."

18:05.047 --> 18:08.005
- I guess that's that.
- Not necessarily.

18:09.647 --> 18:13.356
This cooling duct runs all the way
to the centre of the station.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.281
I saw an access port
in one of the corridors.

18:16.767 --> 18:21.238
This computer may not take kindly
to people snooping around.

18:21.807 --> 18:24.196
I haven't seen any
"no trespassing" signs.

18:26.967 --> 18:28.241
We're explorers.

18:29.287 --> 18:32.962
- Where's your spirit of adventure?
- I left it in a Romulan minefield.

18:43.447 --> 18:44.436
Almost.

18:46.207 --> 18:47.196
Got it.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.806
If the Captain learns about this...

18:48.927 --> 18:51.805
we'll both be scrubbing plasma conduits
for a month.

19:16.607 --> 19:18.996
- Mayweather.
- Travis, this is the Captain.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.881
Would you mind coming down
to Launch Bay 1?

19:22.207 --> 19:25.279
- I thought that section was off limits, sir.
- Not anymore.

19:25.407 --> 19:28.524
- I could use a hand, Ensign.
- Aye, sir.

19:40.207 --> 19:42.596
Are you sure this is the right direction?

19:56.607 --> 19:58.245
Evening, Sub-Commander.

20:04.047 --> 20:05.275
Captain?

20:09.927 --> 20:10.916
Hello?

20:30.567 --> 20:33.127
Do you know how stupid
that little stunt was?

20:33.367 --> 20:36.564
You could just have easily
been transported out into space.

20:37.607 --> 20:38.596
You're senior officers.

20:38.727 --> 20:41.924
You're supposed to be setting
an example for the rest of the crew.

20:42.047 --> 20:43.480
It was my idea, sir.

20:44.047 --> 20:47.483
I think Lieutenant Reed is old enough
to make his own decisions.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.126
You made it clear that you think...

20:50.247 --> 20:53.080
discipline aboard Enterprise
has gotten a little too lax.

20:53.207 --> 20:55.163
I'm beginning to agree with you.

20:56.647 --> 20:59.798
You're both restricted to quarters
until further notice. Dismissed.

20:59.927 --> 21:01.519
- Yes, sir.
- Aye, sir.

21:02.367 --> 21:03.402
Hold on.

21:06.847 --> 21:10.999
Did you notice anything interesting
when you were in there?

21:12.367 --> 21:14.961
Depends on what you mean
by "interesting."

21:15.847 --> 21:17.439
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

21:19.887 --> 21:20.922
Go ahead.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.561
You're needed in Launch Bay 1,
immediately.

21:33.047 --> 21:34.196
What happened?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.685
He's dead, Captain.

21:44.487 --> 21:47.877
These subcutaneous burns
are consistent with an isolytic shock.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.158
But I can't be certain until I perform
a full post-mortem.

21:54.287 --> 21:55.879
I'll keep you apprised.

22:05.007 --> 22:07.316
Looks like he was trying
to tap into the EPS grid...

22:07.447 --> 22:09.165
when this relay overloaded.

22:10.367 --> 22:12.642
Why would he come down here
during his off-hours...

22:12.767 --> 22:14.758
and start tampering
with the power systems?

22:14.887 --> 22:15.876
I don't get it.

22:16.007 --> 22:18.567
He would've checked with me
before doing any maintenance.

22:18.687 --> 22:21.281
Did you notify the crew
that this section was off-limits?

22:21.407 --> 22:22.396
Yes.

22:22.527 --> 22:24.961
Apparently somebody
didn't get the message.

22:27.007 --> 22:29.157
- What time did he go off duty?
- 1800 hours.

22:29.287 --> 22:31.801
Malcolm and I saw him on the station
half an hour later.

22:31.927 --> 22:33.246
He was having dinner with Hoshi.

22:33.367 --> 22:35.927
Talk to her.
See if he said anything about this.

22:36.047 --> 22:39.005
Go over the com logs. I want to know
if he talked to anyone else.

22:39.127 --> 22:42.085
It might be a good idea
to check his quarters as well.

22:44.527 --> 22:47.883
Post a security detail outside
every section that's under repair.

22:48.007 --> 22:49.076
Aye, sir.

23:13.487 --> 23:15.284
A member of my crew is dead.

23:17.567 --> 23:19.364
We don't know what happened.

23:22.607 --> 23:24.802
Your inquiry was not recognised.

23:27.007 --> 23:29.965
My helmsman was killed...

23:31.647 --> 23:33.160
in Launch Bay 1.

23:36.167 --> 23:39.443
We think it happened
while that section was off-limits.

23:39.567 --> 23:41.876
All personnel are required
to vacate areas...

23:42.007 --> 23:44.123
that are undergoing reconstruction.

23:44.247 --> 23:45.680
We're aware of that.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.206
You must have some...

23:50.727 --> 23:52.957
kind of record of what happened.

23:53.087 --> 23:55.396
All personnel are required
to vacate areas...

23:55.527 --> 23:57.722
that are undergoing reconstruction.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.603
I need to talk to a person.

24:03.647 --> 24:06.798
Someone who can access
your database...

24:06.927 --> 24:08.963
and tell me what happened.

24:09.127 --> 24:10.958
Your inquiry was not recognised.

24:11.087 --> 24:13.965
Who built this station? What species?

24:14.087 --> 24:16.157
Your inquiry was not recognised.

24:16.287 --> 24:17.800
What species?

24:17.927 --> 24:21.476
Any damage to these facilities
will be charged to your vessel.

24:26.127 --> 24:29.039
Computer, begin recording.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.202
Subject's name:

24:30.327 --> 24:32.795
Ensign Travis Mayweather,
human male.

24:33.007 --> 24:36.522
Weight: 72 kilograms.
Age: 26 Earth years.

24:37.527 --> 24:39.882
Far too young to be on this table.

24:41.727 --> 24:45.845
Cellular decay suggests that death
occurred at approximately 2330 hours.

24:45.967 --> 24:48.765
Preliminary cause of death:
Ventricular fibrillation...

24:48.887 --> 24:50.718
induced by an isolytic shock.

24:51.567 --> 24:54.400
The vascular system appears to have
functioned as a conduit...

24:54.527 --> 24:55.516
for the discharge.

24:55.647 --> 24:59.356
The musculature shows extensive
necrosis along the conductive pathway.

24:59.487 --> 25:03.924
There are subcutaneous burns
over approximately 12%...

25:04.367 --> 25:05.402
of the body.

25:05.527 --> 25:08.087
The right phalanges and metacarpus
exhibit signs...

25:08.207 --> 25:10.118
of multiple thermal fractures.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.522
Computer, pause. Ensign.

25:14.207 --> 25:16.721
This is not an ideal time.

25:17.287 --> 25:19.596
I wanted to say goodbye.

25:21.847 --> 25:23.678
You may find this disturbing.

25:24.527 --> 25:27.360
I've seen a body before.
Fifteen of them on that alien ship.

25:27.487 --> 25:30.399
It's different when it's someone
you know personally.

25:48.687 --> 25:51.759
I was hoping it was
another one of his practical jokes.

25:53.767 --> 25:56.520
Travis called me down to Decon
a few weeks ago.

25:57.967 --> 26:02.165
Said that he'd brought some kind of
gelatinous life form aboard.

26:02.447 --> 26:04.597
He said it might be sentient...

26:04.727 --> 26:09.118
and that the Captain needed me to
figure out how to communicate with it.

26:10.407 --> 26:13.365
- I don't recall that.
- There was no life form.

26:13.487 --> 26:16.559
It was only strawberry gelatine.

26:18.247 --> 26:20.522
I told him I was going to get him back.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.041
I'm sorry.

26:26.727 --> 26:29.480
It might comfort you to know
he felt very little pain.

26:29.607 --> 26:32.041
An isolytic shock instantly impairs...

26:34.647 --> 26:35.921
the nervous...

26:38.367 --> 26:39.516
That's odd.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.196
What?

26:43.367 --> 26:46.404
They're dead. All of them.

26:47.527 --> 26:48.487
Excuse me, Ensign.

26:48.487 --> 26:48.839
Excuse me, Ensign.

27:02.647 --> 27:05.286
- Anything?
- No.

27:07.447 --> 27:10.644
It doesn't look like Travis used
the com system last night.

27:12.407 --> 27:15.365
Crewman Hayes said she passed him
on his way to the Launch Bay...

27:15.487 --> 27:16.920
but they didn't speak.

27:17.047 --> 27:19.436
She said he seemed to be
in quite a hurry.

27:20.567 --> 27:21.716
What's this?

27:23.487 --> 27:24.761
It's a letter...

27:25.287 --> 27:26.720
to his sister.

27:28.527 --> 27:30.722
It was on the monitor when I came in.

27:33.567 --> 27:35.762
I'm afraid there isn't much here.

27:40.647 --> 27:44.083
He mentions something about
cancelling breakfast with him.

27:48.127 --> 27:50.925
That was last week.

27:52.607 --> 27:55.485
I had to postpone it.

28:00.767 --> 28:03.042
Have we been able
to locate his parents?

28:05.327 --> 28:08.797
Sub-Commander T'Pol's working on it,
but it could take some time.

28:09.007 --> 28:11.521
Cargo ships aren't always easy
to track down.

28:18.247 --> 28:19.282
Archer.

28:19.407 --> 28:22.365
It's Dr. Phlox, Captain.
I need to see you right away.

28:29.847 --> 28:32.759
- Did you find something?
- As a matter of fact, I did.

28:33.167 --> 28:35.237
This is not Ensign Mayweather.

28:36.967 --> 28:39.435
- What?
- It's a nearly perfect replica.

28:39.567 --> 28:42.684
I've never seen a life form duplicated
in such extraordinary detail.

28:42.807 --> 28:45.560
From its epidermis
down to its cellular proteins.

28:46.327 --> 28:47.965
This is remarkable work.

28:48.607 --> 28:50.837
If it's so perfect, how do you know...

28:51.567 --> 28:52.602
it's not him?

28:52.727 --> 28:55.446
Do you recall what happened
to Crewman Fisher last month...

28:55.567 --> 28:57.523
after our visit to Tessik Prime?

28:58.327 --> 29:00.921
He came down with Rigelian fever.

29:01.047 --> 29:03.356
I inoculated the entire crew
to prevent an outbreak.

29:03.487 --> 29:05.921
Would you mind rolling up your sleeve?

29:14.887 --> 29:17.799
The vaccine contained millions
of genetically-altered microbes.

29:17.927 --> 29:19.758
Most of them
are still in your bloodstream.

29:19.887 --> 29:23.084
They typically survive
for at least several weeks.

29:30.767 --> 29:34.521
Every one of the alien microbes
in this body is dead.

29:35.487 --> 29:37.921
Couldn't they have been killed
by the isolytic shock?

29:38.047 --> 29:39.958
These microbes thrive
on isolytic energy.

29:40.087 --> 29:41.839
If anything, they would have multiplied.

29:41.967 --> 29:44.242
I believe that someone or something...

29:44.687 --> 29:49.078
has abducted Ensign Mayweather
and left this facsimile in his place.

29:50.847 --> 29:54.476
Apparently, bulkheads aren't
the only thing this station can replicate.

29:54.607 --> 29:55.926
It's ironic, in a way.

29:56.047 --> 29:59.084
The station can duplicate a dead
human body in exquisite detail...

29:59.207 --> 30:01.767
yet a living, simple
one-celled organism...

30:01.887 --> 30:03.525
is beyond its capability.

30:05.607 --> 30:07.837
I've located
Ensign Mayweather's parents.

30:07.967 --> 30:10.686
You better hold off.
Their son may still be alive.

30:11.567 --> 30:14.161
You and Trip managed to get
pretty far inside the station.

30:14.287 --> 30:16.562
How close do you think you got
to the computer core?

30:16.687 --> 30:19.042
We were within 20 metres
when we tripped the sensors.

30:19.167 --> 30:21.635
Think you could find a way
to get past them?

30:21.927 --> 30:22.962
I believe so.

30:23.087 --> 30:25.157
Our repairs will be complete
in 19 minutes.

30:25.287 --> 30:27.482
The station's expecting us to depart.

30:28.447 --> 30:30.756
- Bridge to Engineering.
- Tucker here.

30:30.967 --> 30:32.878
Trip, have you prepared our payment?

30:33.007 --> 30:34.679
The canisters are almost ready, sir.

30:34.807 --> 30:36.604
Don't be in such a hurry.

30:49.087 --> 30:51.806
Two hundred litres of warp plasma,
as promised.

30:52.407 --> 30:55.763
Please place your compensation
on the transport platform.

30:58.847 --> 31:00.599
Hold on.

31:00.727 --> 31:03.685
There's a couple of problems
we need to discuss first.

31:04.247 --> 31:07.603
Now, I'm not real happy
with the quality of some of your work.

31:08.887 --> 31:10.002
Are you listening to me?

31:10.127 --> 31:13.403
Please place your compensation
on the transport platform.

31:13.567 --> 31:17.162
I've looked at the bolt-couplings
you used to attach the new hull plating.

31:17.287 --> 31:19.801
I'm afraid they're not up to
Starfleet specs.

31:20.607 --> 31:22.802
And the subspace amplifier
you repaired?

31:22.927 --> 31:26.397
We're picking up distortion
on all the high-band frequencies.

31:26.807 --> 31:30.117
Please place your compensation
on the transport platform.

31:30.527 --> 31:33.678
We're not paying until we sort this out.

31:45.007 --> 31:47.999
What guarantee do I have...

31:48.127 --> 31:52.166
that these duranium pins won't fly out
the instant we jump to warp?

31:52.727 --> 31:54.683
Your inquiry was not recognised.

31:58.207 --> 32:01.517
On my world, we have an expression:

32:02.007 --> 32:04.077
"The customer's always right."

32:04.407 --> 32:07.080
Maybe you should make that
part of your program.

32:10.167 --> 32:12.847
I want to know how someone files
a grievance around here.

32:20.887 --> 32:23.355
It's there, about five metres ahead.

33:05.087 --> 33:08.921
Sounds like you've got
more important things to deal with.

34:23.007 --> 34:25.726
Incursion detected in primary data core.

34:25.967 --> 34:28.561
Vacate this section
or your vessel will be compromised.

34:28.687 --> 34:30.723
I'm detecting one human bio-sign.

34:31.766 --> 34:32.960
Are they alive?

34:34.766 --> 34:37.235
Their vital organs
appear to be functioning.

34:37.527 --> 34:39.802
They've suffered
severe neurological damage.

34:39.927 --> 34:42.235
Incursion detected in primary data core.

34:42.766 --> 34:46.315
Vacate this section or your vessel
will be compromised.

34:47.087 --> 34:49.601
Their synaptic pathways
have been reconfigured.

34:49.726 --> 34:51.763
Integrated into the computer core.

34:53.927 --> 34:56.395
Incursion detected in primary data core.

34:56.927 --> 34:59.885
Vacate this section
or your vessel will be compromised.

35:01.407 --> 35:02.476
Captain.

35:07.807 --> 35:10.367
Incursion detected in primary data core.

35:10.847 --> 35:14.044
Vacate this section
or your vessel will be compromised.

35:29.607 --> 35:32.075
Three of the station's arms
just clamped onto the hull.

35:32.207 --> 35:34.596
- Polarise the hull plating.
- There's no effect.

35:34.727 --> 35:36.046
Stand by weapons.

35:38.287 --> 35:39.845
They're going offline.

35:39.967 --> 35:43.084
The station's tapped into
the ship's umbilical ports.

35:44.007 --> 35:45.725
It's overriding our command functions.

35:45.847 --> 35:47.883
Try to lock out the main computer.

35:48.807 --> 35:51.037
I can't. Our access codes
have been scrambled.

35:51.447 --> 35:53.802
It's okay, Travis.
We're taking you home.

35:55.047 --> 35:56.116
Right here.

36:29.047 --> 36:31.242
- Archer to the Bridge.
- The com's down.

36:34.927 --> 36:35.916
Travis?

36:36.047 --> 36:37.765
On his way to Sick Bay.
What's our status?

36:37.887 --> 36:40.355
It's been better.
The station's got us by the thrusters.

36:40.487 --> 36:42.318
Impulse engines?

36:44.047 --> 36:45.082
Offline.

36:45.927 --> 36:48.316
- We're losing main power.
- Life support's failing.

36:48.447 --> 36:51.439
Malcolm, I think it's time
we deliver our payment.

37:08.127 --> 37:11.244
It did some heavy damage, sir.
Power levels are dropping.

37:11.727 --> 37:13.922
But the plasma hasn't ignited
the O2 conduits yet.

37:14.047 --> 37:17.119
It needs to reach 3,000 degrees,
Malcolm. Be patient.

37:17.487 --> 37:18.761
Yes, sir.

37:27.127 --> 37:30.164
I'm reading secondary explosions
throughout the station.

37:36.807 --> 37:38.798
Command functions are
coming back online.

37:38.927 --> 37:41.157
- Engines?
- Impulse and thrusters.

37:41.447 --> 37:44.120
One of those arms
is still locked onto the hull.

37:48.647 --> 37:51.366
If we don't disengage soon,
we'll be incinerated.

37:52.047 --> 37:53.765
- Full thrusters!
- It's no good.

37:53.887 --> 37:57.084
If I fired up the impulse engines,
we'd tear off the saucer section.

37:57.207 --> 37:58.401
Can you launch a torpedo?

37:58.527 --> 38:00.483
At this range, sir,
I wouldn't recommend it.

38:00.607 --> 38:03.201
I agree, but I don't think
we have much choice.

38:12.367 --> 38:13.880
One more, Lieutenant.

38:22.647 --> 38:24.000
Get us out of here.

38:45.247 --> 38:47.363
You look pretty good for a dead guy.

38:49.167 --> 38:50.600
How are you feeling?

38:51.967 --> 38:54.879
Much better, sir. Thank you.

38:57.927 --> 38:59.963
The doctor told me what happened.

39:00.527 --> 39:02.279
I'm not sure I understand.

39:02.447 --> 39:04.881
We're still trying to figure that out
for ourselves.

39:05.007 --> 39:07.680
I may be able to shed some light
on the subject.

39:11.047 --> 39:12.878
It seems to be some kind of interface...

39:13.007 --> 39:15.885
designed to convert neural impulses
into binary code.

39:16.247 --> 39:20.638
Essentially, the station was using your
brain to enhance its processing power.

39:21.127 --> 39:24.164
- Why would it do that?
- The cerebral cortex is...

39:24.327 --> 39:26.921
the most sophisticated computer
known to exist.

39:29.047 --> 39:31.083
What about all those other people?

39:31.407 --> 39:34.956
According to T'Pol's scans,
most of them had been there for years.

39:35.567 --> 39:38.001
The damage to their brains
was irreversible.

39:38.687 --> 39:42.475
Fortunately, you were removed
before any permanent injury occurred.

39:42.727 --> 39:44.763
When can I have my helmsman back?

39:45.327 --> 39:48.956
I'd like to observe him
for another 24 hours, if you don't mind.

39:55.767 --> 39:58.679
Captain's mess. Friday morning, 0800.

39:59.727 --> 40:02.719
- Don't be late.
- Sounds good, sir.
