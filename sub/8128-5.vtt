07:20.773 --> 07:23.141
         Who said anything about
         gambling on the horses?

07:23.143 --> 07:27.111
    You just did when you said  
  Lady Luck shined on you today.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.979
        Come on, Edith.         
    Lots of people say that.    

07:28.981 --> 07:32.216
            I haven't heard you 
          say that for 20 years.

07:32.218 --> 07:35.086
            Oh, Archie.         
         You broke your promise.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.488
Listen, listen! Edith, Edith,   
it ain't what you think.        

07:37.490 --> 07:38.722
Now, just pay attention to me.  

07:38.724 --> 07:41.125
Barney Heffner come up to me,   
see, and he says to me,         

07:41.127 --> 07:43.827
"Listen, I got a hot tip        
on a sure thing in the third."  

07:43.829 --> 07:45.229
                     Oh, Archie!

07:45.231 --> 07:47.498
Edith, don't be like this.      

07:47.500 --> 07:49.067
        Oh! How could you do it?

07:49.069 --> 07:52.503
Edith, it turned out good.      
Look, a 40-to-1 shot.           

07:52.505 --> 07:54.805
Look what I got here.           
Eighty dollars, Edith.          

07:54.807 --> 07:58.443
Less $3 that I laid out         
for the presents.               

08:00.345 --> 08:01.412
Hey!                            

08:01.414 --> 08:02.780
              That don't matter!

08:02.782 --> 08:04.882
     You started gambling again!

08:04.884 --> 08:07.552
I did not                       
start gambling again!           

08:07.554 --> 08:11.055
This is a one-time              
and a one-time thing only--     

08:11.057 --> 08:12.390

are you looking at?             

08:13.892 --> 08:16.594
Edith, when Barney asked me     
if I wanted to bet again,       

08:16.596 --> 08:18.329
I told him no!                  

08:18.331 --> 08:20.264
N-O-W! No!

08:22.402 --> 08:23.801
What do you want me to do?      

08:23.803 --> 08:28.706
You want me to swear to you?    
Okay, I'll swear. Pinkie swear. 

08:28.708 --> 08:33.077
      Oh, thank you, Archie.    
 That makes me feel much better.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.479
            I'll get you a beer.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.515
No, no. Never mind, Edith.      
I'll get the beer myself.       

08:37.517 --> 08:39.116
    Jeez, look at that          
      all over the floor.       

08:39.119 --> 08:42.120
    Reminds me of when          
     we had Arthur the cat.     

08:44.856 --> 08:46.690
Gee, Ma. Weren't you            
awfully hard on Daddy?          

08:46.692 --> 08:48.892
After all, it was               
only a $2 bet.                  

08:48.894 --> 08:52.196
 Oh, it ain't the money, Gloria.
    It's the sickness.          

08:52.198 --> 08:54.865
            I don't want to live
             through that again.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.966
         What sickness?         

08:55.968 --> 08:58.102
          The gambling sickness.

08:58.104 --> 09:01.172
  You wouldn't remember, Gloria,
    because you were too young. 

09:01.174 --> 09:03.107
            You was 3 years old.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.876
            The poker playing   
                was bad enough, 

09:05.878 --> 09:08.479
            but then he started 
          gambling on the horses

09:08.481 --> 09:10.047
        and he couldn't stop!   

09:10.049 --> 09:12.683
             Sometimes he'd lose
             his whole paycheck.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.818
Gee, that doesn't               
sound like Daddy.               

09:14.820 --> 09:17.855
            It wasn't him.      
            It was the sickness.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.524
        Ma, how did you         
        get him to stop?        

09:19.526 --> 09:24.228
      I packed a suitcase       
     and dressed Gloria up      

09:24.230 --> 09:26.531
and told him I was leaving.

              he laid on me?    

09:41.847 --> 09:43.447

      it was just a joke.

     Ma was telling us about    
 your gambling days, that's all.

    my gambling days!

    to talk about that time!

    I won't anymore, Archie,    
because I finished telling them.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.001
I was only out of the room      
one minute.                     

10:04.003 --> 10:06.304
You finished telling them       
that whole long story?          

10:06.306 --> 10:07.971
Whenever you tell me            
even a little story,            

10:07.973 --> 10:09.507
it takes you forever.           

10:09.509 --> 10:11.509
                 That's because 
            you interrupt me.   

10:11.511 --> 10:12.776

        Get to the point."      

10:15.315 --> 10:18.649
            And that mixes me up
            and I lose my place.

If I didn't interrupt you,

when you was finished.

            Where are you going?

10:26.526 --> 10:30.994

          And one day,          
  I was looking out the window  

13:53.833 --> 13:57.267
        and I saw a man         
    driving off in it.          

13:57.269 --> 13:58.502
      I yelled at Archie,       

13:58.504 --> 14:01.839
     "Archie, there's a man     
    stealing our car."          

14:01.841 --> 14:04.442
            He says,            
 "He ain't stealing it, Edith." 

14:04.444 --> 14:07.945
 I lost it to him last night."  

14:07.947 --> 14:10.147
        That's terrible.        

14:10.149 --> 14:11.549
         Yeah. It was.          

14:11.551 --> 14:13.551
 But I didn't hit Archie then.  

14:13.553 --> 14:15.920
      And I shouldn't have      
    hit him this time.          

14:15.922 --> 14:17.354
 Ma, you couldn't help yourself.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.491
 I couldn't help Archie either. 

14:20.493 --> 14:23.494
     Remember when you had      
    the chicken pox, Gloria?    

14:23.496 --> 14:25.195
    I didn't hit you.           

14:27.231 --> 14:29.700
        What's that got to do   
            with anything?      

14:29.702 --> 14:31.502
        Ooh, everything.        

14:31.504 --> 14:35.038
  Gambling is a sickness too.   

14:35.040 --> 14:37.407
Oh, I don't know what           
I'm gonna say to him            

14:37.409 --> 14:39.142
when he comes home tonight.     

14:39.144 --> 14:42.145
If he comes home tonight.       

14:42.147 --> 14:44.682
                Oh, Ma.         
      Of course he'll come home.

14:44.684 --> 14:49.019
I don't know, Gloria.           
Your father is a very proud man.

14:49.021 --> 14:53.757
He comes from a family where the
women didn't hit their husbands.

14:53.759 --> 14:57.695
At least not when               
they was looking at them.       

14:57.697 --> 15:00.931
    Ma, Archie's had a whole day
        to think about this.    

15:00.933 --> 15:02.833
      By now, he probably       
    realizes it's his fault.    

15:02.835 --> 15:04.101
    He's gonna walk in here,    

15:04.103 --> 15:05.970
    he's not gonna say          
    anything about it.          

15:05.972 --> 15:09.039
      And I don't believe       
      a word I just said.       

15:09.041 --> 15:10.841
            Michael.            

15:10.843 --> 15:14.011
    Ma, you lost your temper.   
      It could happen to anyone.

15:14.013 --> 15:17.147
I never hit anybody             
in my whole life.               

15:17.149 --> 15:20.083
         Not even when          
      I was a little girl.      

15:20.085 --> 15:24.087
     Not even Elsie Lawler.     

15:24.089 --> 15:26.089
         Elsie Lawler?          

15:26.091 --> 15:28.125
I haven't heard you             
talk about her. Who's she?      

15:28.127 --> 15:30.861
            She sat behind me   
            in fourth grade.    

15:30.863 --> 15:32.830
     Ooh, she was so mean to me.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.264
What did she do?                

15:34.266 --> 15:38.869
 Well, once in the playground,  
  I was running after a ball,   

15:38.871 --> 15:40.971
and she stuck her foot out      
         and tripped me         

15:40.973 --> 15:44.374
     and I fell on my face      
      and chipped a tooth.      

15:44.376 --> 15:45.442
Ma, I would've hit her!         

15:45.444 --> 15:47.310
         Everybody wanted me to.

15:47.312 --> 15:51.481
Jerry Lawler offered to hold her
so I could hit her better.      

15:51.483 --> 15:54.251
        Her own brother.        

15:54.253 --> 15:56.620
But I-- I couldn't do it.       

15:56.622 --> 15:58.956
I gave it to her, though.       

15:58.958 --> 16:03.460
  I said, "All right for you,   
         Elsie Lawler!"         

16:04.529 --> 16:07.965
She knew I was mad at her.      

16:07.967 --> 16:13.871
I never hit Elsie Lawler,       
     but I hit your father.     

16:13.873 --> 16:16.473
     Give us another beer there,
          will you, Kelsey?     

16:16.475 --> 16:19.677
     You gonna drink            
your dinner tonight, Arch?      

16:19.679 --> 16:21.912
        Are you in the business 
      of asking stupid questions

16:21.914 --> 16:23.647
                or selling beer?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.649
I was just asking--             
    Asking me a stupid question.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.384
        Can't you find nobody   
              else to talk to?  

16:29.220 --> 16:31.488
Arch, there ain't               
nobody else in here.            

16:31.490 --> 16:33.958
    That solves your problem,   
             then. Shut up.     

16:36.194 --> 16:37.628
                     Hey, Kelse!

16:37.630 --> 16:40.363
            Give me one of them 
        tall, cold ones, huh?   

16:40.365 --> 16:41.765
                     Hiya, Arch.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.433
    Don't be giving me that     
      "Hiya, Arch" stuff,       

16:43.435 --> 16:44.768
        you crumb, you.         

16:44.770 --> 16:47.871
    Hey, look, pal. I'm sorry   
         that your horse lost.  

16:47.873 --> 16:49.773
        But I wasn't riding him,
                you know.       

16:49.775 --> 16:51.976
     That ain't the point.      

16:51.978 --> 16:54.377
        Why did you have        
to call me up at my house?      

16:54.379 --> 16:57.748
        Because I figured that's
          where your phone was. 

16:57.750 --> 17:00.484
Look at me, Barney.             
I ain't laughing at that.       

17:00.486 --> 17:01.752
                             Ah!
Listen!                         

17:01.754 --> 17:04.154
Edith was not supposed to know  
I was betting on a horse.       

17:04.156 --> 17:07.190
    Oh! Keeping secrets from    
     the little wifey, huh?     

17:07.192 --> 17:08.925
     That ain't nice, Arch.     

17:08.928 --> 17:10.994
    What did Edith say          
      when she found out?       

17:10.997 --> 17:16.099
 Well, it wasn't what she said, 
  it was the way she said it.   

17:16.102 --> 17:17.768
                    I get it.   

17:17.770 --> 17:20.303
    You're in the doghouse and  
  you're afraid to go home, huh?

17:20.305 --> 17:22.106
I ain't afraid to go home.      

17:22.108 --> 17:24.141
      Hey, Arch. You want to get
          Edith back in line,   

17:24.143 --> 17:25.608
    you got to do what I did.   

17:25.611 --> 17:28.545
Awwww-- What?                   

17:28.547 --> 17:32.149
  When Mabel gave me a bad time,
 I didn't stay out, I went home.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.052
 But I ignored her, made believe
      she wasn't even there.    

17:35.054 --> 17:37.387
Ah, it wouldn't work with Edith.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.524
      I do that even when       
      I ain't mad at her.       

17:40.526 --> 17:43.127
     Arch, you don't understand.

17:43.129 --> 17:46.063
I gave her the cold shoulder.   
     I didn't even go near her. 

17:46.065 --> 17:50.000
Not downstairs, nor upstairs,   
        if you get my drift.    

17:51.469 --> 17:53.537
Oh, you done that, huh?         

17:53.539 --> 17:57.074
        For two whole weeks.    
    Drove her right up the wall.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.475
                    Hee-hee-hee!

17:58.477 --> 18:04.014
  Ah, no, that'd be punishing   
        Edith too hard.         

18:04.016 --> 18:06.583
         You see, Arch, there's 
    your trouble right there.   

18:06.585 --> 18:08.018
        You're too soft-hearted.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.687
I know, Barney.                 
What am I gonna do?             

18:09.689 --> 18:11.055
That's the way I am.            

18:11.057 --> 18:13.256
         Well, if you don't want
         to do it the quiet way,

18:13.258 --> 18:14.725
            then you'd better   
                start hollering.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.259
                  When a woman  
            gets out of line,   

18:16.261 --> 18:17.460
                she wants to be 
            straightened out.   

18:17.462 --> 18:19.163
         They're just like kids.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.031
I know all that.                

18:21.033 --> 18:23.934
Yeah, I know you know all that. 
But what are you doing about it?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.535
                            Hmm?

18:25.537 --> 18:26.870
                            Huh?

18:26.872 --> 18:28.672
    I'll show you what          
     I'm gonna do about it.     

18:28.674 --> 18:31.374
        I'll see the two        
        of youse later.         

18:31.376 --> 18:32.743
            Go get her, Arch!   

18:32.745 --> 18:34.712
                        [LAUGHS]
What's with you, Barney?        

18:34.714 --> 18:36.479
Did you see the look            
on his face?                    

18:36.481 --> 18:38.182
It's gonna be murder            
at his house.                   

18:38.184 --> 18:39.950
You've got him                  
all steamed up.                 

18:39.952 --> 18:43.253
        What are friends for?   

18:43.255 --> 18:45.956
         Gloria!                

18:45.958 --> 18:47.390
            Gloria!             

18:47.392 --> 18:48.625
Yeah, Michael, what is it?      

18:48.627 --> 18:50.427
          I just saw your father
            turning the corner. 

18:50.429 --> 18:51.795
         He'll be here          
          any minute.           

18:51.797 --> 18:53.197
Oh, Ma. Did you hear that?      

18:53.199 --> 18:55.565
        Yeah. I ain't looking   
              forward to this.  

18:55.567 --> 18:57.701
          Now, don't you let him
            walk all over you.  

18:57.703 --> 19:00.838
                Gloria, let me  
             handle this my way.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.742
    And, please, this is private
    between Archie and me.      

19:04.744 --> 19:07.377
        Right, Ma.              
              We'll be upstairs.

19:22.627 --> 19:25.062
I'm glad you're alone, Edith,   
because there's some things--   

19:25.064 --> 19:27.364
You get away from me.           
                            Huh?

19:36.407 --> 19:38.075
I said, you get away from me,   

19:38.077 --> 19:40.377
unless you got something        
to say to me.                   

19:40.379 --> 19:42.379
                 I got something
                  to say to you.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.781
                You hit me!     
                And you hurt me!

19:43.783 --> 19:45.649
                    And I demand
                     an apology!

19:45.651 --> 19:48.718
It's you that's gotta           
apologize to me.                

19:48.720 --> 19:50.487
            I gotta?            

19:50.489 --> 19:56.126
 That's like asking Pearl Harbor
    to apologize to the Japs!   

19:56.128 --> 19:58.695
Oh, Archie.                     
I don't want to argue.          

19:58.697 --> 20:01.398
I've been worrying              
about you all day.              

20:01.400 --> 20:03.133
                 Yeah, well,    
             you should've been!

20:03.135 --> 20:04.734
              Because you hit me
            and you hurt me.    

20:04.736 --> 20:07.337
              Did I ever hit you
                for any reason? 

20:07.339 --> 20:09.639
I never gave you                
any reason.                     

20:09.641 --> 20:13.743
                 That don't make
                  no difference!

20:13.745 --> 20:16.579
      You know, a lot of wives  
get belted by their husbands,   

20:16.581 --> 20:18.816
 whether they deserve it or not.

20:18.818 --> 20:22.886
Archie, I could forgive you     
for hitting me,                 

20:22.888 --> 20:26.290
but I don't think               
I could ever forgive you        

20:26.292 --> 20:29.026
for making me hit you.          

20:29.028 --> 20:32.629
            What does that mean?

20:32.631 --> 20:35.098
It means you lied to me.        

20:36.600 --> 20:38.168
          Listen, Edith, listen.

20:38.170 --> 20:42.639
        You know, I still ain't 
    got no feeling over here.   

20:42.641 --> 20:46.176
    I was standing right here,  
 looking at you, smiling at you,

20:46.178 --> 20:49.880
    and you slugged the smile   
            right off of me.    

20:49.882 --> 20:53.183
    Now, I demand an apology.   

20:53.185 --> 20:55.452
Archie, can I                   
read you something?             

20:55.454 --> 20:58.521
Don't read me nothing, Edith.   
         I want an apology.     

20:58.523 --> 20:59.756
This is an apology.             

21:02.060 --> 21:05.662
          Well, I didn't ask you
             to write it out.   

21:05.664 --> 21:08.431
But as long as you done that,   
          that's okay too.      

21:08.433 --> 21:12.736
            All right. Go ahead.
            Read it to me.      

21:12.738 --> 21:15.339
"I'm sorry                      
for what I've done.             

21:15.341 --> 21:19.009
"I don't know how I could have  
done such a terrible thing      

21:19.011 --> 21:22.346
"to someone who's been          
so good to me.                  

21:24.782 --> 21:27.684
"I promise never to do it again.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.087
  I hope you can forgive me."   

21:30.089 --> 21:32.756
             Good.              

21:32.758 --> 21:34.992
 It ain't the fanciest writing  
         in the world,          

21:34.994 --> 21:38.362
     but then you ain't no      
  Henry Woolworth Longfellow.   

21:40.265 --> 21:43.533
        It's an apology         
and, all right, then, I accept. 

21:43.535 --> 21:46.403
I didn't write this,            
Archie, you did.                

21:46.405 --> 21:47.971
                      Huh?      

21:47.973 --> 21:49.506
    Twenty years ago,           

21:49.508 --> 21:53.576
when I was gonna leave you      
because you was gambling,       

21:53.578 --> 21:55.145
        you wrote this.         

21:55.147 --> 21:56.546
                      I did not!

21:56.548 --> 21:59.216
Oh, yeah. See, here it is,      
your own handwriting.           

21:59.218 --> 22:01.618
"Dearest Edith, I'm sorry--"    

22:01.620 --> 22:04.521
            Don't read it again,
                 will you?!     

22:04.523 --> 22:07.391
    Now, you set me up          
     for that thing, Edith.     

22:07.393 --> 22:08.926
     But that don't count.      

22:08.928 --> 22:11.128
 You ain't gonna get away with  
it. That letter's too old.      

22:11.130 --> 22:12.930
          What I mean to say,   
             it's expired.      

22:14.999 --> 22:16.599
     Archie,                    

22:16.601 --> 22:21.071
all you've got to do is         
change the date on this letter  

22:21.073 --> 22:24.975
and sign it right here          
under the P.S. that you wrote.  

22:24.977 --> 22:31.681
See, "P.S., I swear to God      
I'll never gamble again."       

22:31.683 --> 22:34.017
And while you're doing that,    

22:34.019 --> 22:39.022
I'll tell you how sorry         
I am that I hit you.            

22:50.234 --> 22:52.535
         Get me a pencil, Edith!

22:59.510 --> 23:03.780
         Look at her, she whips 
        it out like Matt Dillon.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.715
                Give it here.   

23:10.788 --> 23:14.557
            You're a pip,       
        you know that, Edith?   

23:14.559 --> 23:18.261
                A real...pip.   

23:26.937 --> 23:28.305
                     Edith!     

23:28.307 --> 23:29.906
    Oh, hello, Archie.          

23:29.908 --> 23:33.076
There you are.                  
                        Yeah.   

23:33.078 --> 23:34.544
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.   

23:34.546 --> 23:36.246
        Wait a minute, Edith.   

23:36.248 --> 23:38.148
Did you have the exterminator   
        in here today?          

23:38.150 --> 23:39.582
                    No.         

23:39.584 --> 23:41.284
Well, what were                 
you doing anyway?               

23:41.286 --> 23:42.685
You spraying for roaches        
or something?                   

23:42.687 --> 23:44.121
                             No.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.391
Hold it. Hold it.               
Stand back. Stand back.         

23:47.393 --> 23:50.894
I think that's                  
coming off of you.              

23:50.896 --> 23:55.332
     Oh, Gloria let me use some 
of that perfume you gave her.   

23:55.334 --> 23:57.967
                    Don't you--?

23:57.969 --> 23:59.302
              Don't you like it?

23:59.304 --> 24:01.538
Ah, Edith, yeah, sure.          

24:01.540 --> 24:06.410
But, uh...I don't think         
it's for indoors, you know.     

24:06.412 --> 24:10.247
I think that perfume            
was for going out.              

24:10.249 --> 24:12.382
Uh, why don't you take a bath.  

24:33.704 --> 24:37.240
             [♪]                

24:37.242 --> 24:41.311
          ANNOUNCER:
