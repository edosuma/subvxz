Aah... Dr. Brooks,
is this gonna hurt?

00:54.034 --> 00:55.661
I'm afraid just a IittIe.

00:55.702 --> 00:56.896
More than a tickIe

00:56.937 --> 00:59.405
but way Iess than
paying your taxes.

00:59.439 --> 01:00.838
( chuckles )

That's right.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.983

--Mm-hmm.

01:12.018 --> 01:16.079

01:52.659 --> 01:55.219
 WaIking down the bouIevard 

01:55.262 --> 01:58.925
 I don't need

01:58.965 --> 02:01.934
 Not today 

02:01.968 --> 02:04.562

02:04.604 --> 02:06.902

02:46.713 --> 02:51.047
 Just to feeI

02:51.084 --> 02:53.814
 Once again 

02:53.854 --> 02:55.788
 To you, my friend,
I must confess 

02:55.822 --> 03:00.316
 To me she stands
above the rest, you see 

03:02.963 --> 03:07.297
( tires screeching )

03:14.808 --> 03:18.039
 Gonna see my IittIe girI

03:45.272 --> 03:48.332
and we promise

03:48.375 --> 03:50.275
Now, if your jaw stiII hurts
tonight

03:50.310 --> 03:51.607
take two piIIs.

03:51.645 --> 03:54.341
If it stiII hurts
tomorrow, then...

03:54.381 --> 03:56.246
you shouId probabIy find
a new dentist.

03:56.283 --> 03:57.215
Huh?

03:57.250 --> 03:59.275
( laughs )

04:00.754 --> 04:02.722
''Find a...''

04:02.756 --> 04:04.553
It's a IittIe joke.

04:04.591 --> 04:05.888
--Oh.
--Anyway

04:05.926 --> 04:08.087
just caII us tomorrow,
Iet us know how you feeI.

04:09.162 --> 04:11.130

--HeIIo, IittIe darIing.

04:11.164 --> 04:12.131
HeIIo, you.

04:12.165 --> 04:13.132
Mom... hi.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.997

04:15.035 --> 04:16.024
Hi. How are you?

04:16.069 --> 04:17.036
Can I...?

04:17.070 --> 04:18.697
Excuse us for a second.

04:18.738 --> 04:20.365
--Uh, enjoy them.
--Come on, Mom.

04:22.776 --> 04:24.073
Mom...

04:24.110 --> 04:26.374
I Iove that you're
invoIved in my practice

04:26.413 --> 04:28.643
but you can't be giving
out sugar cookies

04:28.682 --> 04:30.309
in a dentaI office.

04:30.350 --> 04:32.545
Your father aIways beIieved

04:32.586 --> 04:33.917
in the personaI touch.

04:33.954 --> 04:35.751
And repeat business.

04:35.789 --> 04:37.222
( chuckles )

04:37.257 --> 04:38.884
Hey, T, got a surprise.

04:38.925 --> 04:41.655
This guy says
he's an oId buddy of yours.

04:41.695 --> 04:43.390
I don't know this man.

04:43.430 --> 04:45.864
( Latin accent ):
WeII, I'm Ernesto
JuIio RaphaeI Santisto.

04:45.899 --> 04:47.093
Oh.

04:47.133 --> 04:49.601
( no Latin accent ):
And you've been served.

04:49.636 --> 04:50.728
Do you vaIidate?

04:50.770 --> 04:51.828
Oh, no, you got to go.

04:51.871 --> 04:53.361
Hey, hey, stamp
my ticket, man.

04:53.406 --> 04:54.373
Sure, I'm gonna
stamp your head.

04:54.407 --> 04:55.806
Stamp my ticket!

04:55.842 --> 04:57.434
MOTHER:
Ted?

04:57.477 --> 04:59.672
Are you being sued?

04:59.713 --> 05:02.648
Oh, hey, if this is
about that Freeman kid...

05:02.682 --> 05:04.309
He's Iying.

05:04.351 --> 05:06.979
I mean, okay, maybe I shouIdn't
have been driIIing Ieft-handed

05:07.020 --> 05:08.317
but he dared me...

05:08.355 --> 05:09.481
WouId you shut up.

05:09.522 --> 05:10.682
It's about a wiII.

05:10.724 --> 05:12.191
Whew.

05:12.225 --> 05:15.217
But I definiteIy think they have
the wrong Theodore Brooks.

05:15.261 --> 05:18.128
It's about some Iady in AIaska,
a pIace caIIed ToIketna.

05:18.164 --> 05:18.892
( coughs )

05:18.932 --> 05:19.921
AIaska?!

05:19.966 --> 05:22.059
They definiteIy got
the wrong Ted Brooks.

05:22.102 --> 05:24.536
See, they're Iooking
for the white Ted Brooks.

05:24.571 --> 05:26.095
WeII, her name is
Lucy Watkins...

05:26.139 --> 05:28.164
( coughing )

05:28.208 --> 05:28.970
Mom!

05:29.009 --> 05:31.500
Rupert, get her
something to drink!

05:31.544 --> 05:33.569
Wait a minute,
reIax, reIax.

05:33.613 --> 05:35.547
Sit down.
Breathe, breathe.

05:35.582 --> 05:37.311
Here. Rinse and spit.

05:38.184 --> 05:40.118
Oh, Teddy Bear...

05:40.153 --> 05:41.848
How can I...?

05:41.888 --> 05:43.480
How do I...?

05:43.523 --> 05:44.956
How do you what?!

05:47.694 --> 05:48.683
Ted...

05:51.264 --> 05:52.526
Teddy...

05:55.902 --> 05:58.496
You're adopted.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.335
( thud )

06:03.376 --> 06:05.810
( sighs )

06:05.845 --> 06:08.871
MOTHER:
We always meant to tell you

06:08.915 --> 06:10.542
and then your father died...

06:10.583 --> 06:13.882
This doesn't change anything.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.684
You will always be
my Teddy Bear...

06:16.723 --> 06:18.020
my Teddy Bear...

06:18.058 --> 06:19.582
my Teddy Bear...

06:19.626 --> 06:21.924
Ted!

06:21.961 --> 06:23.258
Ted!

06:23.296 --> 06:24.593
Hey, Ted, come on.

06:24.631 --> 06:26.258
Don't trip on this.

06:26.299 --> 06:27.266
AII right?

06:27.300 --> 06:29.598
A Iot of peopIe are adopted.

06:29.636 --> 06:30.603
( sighs )

06:30.637 --> 06:31.865
Famous peopIe.

06:31.905 --> 06:32.872
You know, you got Webster

06:32.906 --> 06:33.873
and Soon-Yi.

06:33.907 --> 06:35.602
And those kids
from Different Strokes

06:35.642 --> 06:36.768
they turned out okay.

06:36.810 --> 06:38.107
I shouId've known.

06:38.144 --> 06:39.111
PIease.

06:39.145 --> 06:40.510
There were so many signs.

06:40.547 --> 06:41.514
ReaIIy?

06:41.548 --> 06:42.845
Yeah, I...

06:42.882 --> 06:44.076
Like what?

06:44.117 --> 06:45.414
WeII...

06:45.452 --> 06:47.579
Like bIue cheese!

06:47.620 --> 06:51.181
I love bIue cheese,
and they hate it.

06:51.224 --> 06:52.191
Ooh!

06:52.225 --> 06:54.090
Uncanny.

06:54.127 --> 06:56.322
So how was it Iiving
with strangers?

06:56.362 --> 06:57.420
( cracking neck )

06:57.464 --> 06:58.362
( plane buzzing )

06:58.398 --> 06:59.092
( chuckles )

07:03.436 --> 07:05.233
Why am I a dentist,
Rupert?

07:05.271 --> 07:07.398
Duh! 'Cause your
daddy's a dentist.

07:07.440 --> 07:12.002
Maybe I was meant
to do something different...

07:12.045 --> 07:14.639
be someone eIse.

07:18.752 --> 07:22.848
( wind howling )

07:25.592 --> 07:27.287

07:27.327 --> 07:29.761

07:29.796 --> 07:33.288

07:38.505 --> 07:39.472
Aah!

07:39.506 --> 07:40.803
( gasps )

07:40.840 --> 07:43.468
I'm an Eskimo?!

07:44.577 --> 07:46.238

08:07.801 --> 08:08.768
Okay.

controI accessory.

08:19.579 --> 08:21.444
But wait, there's more.

08:21.481 --> 08:23.506
There better not be more.

08:23.550 --> 08:24.847

08:24.884 --> 08:28.479
You're gonna receive a biII

Where did you come from?

20:59.638 --> 21:01.037
( barking )

21:01.073 --> 21:04.099
Nobody said anything
about Lucy having a dog.

21:04.143 --> 21:08.443
Of course, no one said anything
about her having a son, either.

22:30.062 --> 22:31.723
--Let go! Let go!
--( material ripping )

22:31.764 --> 22:33.129
Aah! No, not the jacket!

22:33.165 --> 22:34.223
No, doggies!

22:34.266 --> 22:36.097
( barking )

22:36.135 --> 22:36.965
( growling )

22:37.002 --> 22:37.991
( yelling )

22:38.037 --> 22:39.265
( grunts )

22:39.304 --> 22:40.566
Hey, I come in peace!

22:40.606 --> 22:41.868
( material ripping )

22:41.907 --> 22:42.805
Stop it!

22:42.841 --> 22:44.570
Ha, ha, wait, that tickIes.

22:44.610 --> 22:46.237
Aah! Oh, no!

22:46.278 --> 22:48.769
Okay, wait! Aah, get off!

22:48.814 --> 22:49.803
Let me go!

22:49.848 --> 22:50.815
Stop that!

22:50.849 --> 22:52.976
( barking )

22:53.018 --> 22:54.315
( yelling )

22:54.353 --> 22:57.049
G-Give me the door!

22:57.089 --> 23:00.149
--Aah!
--( barking continues )

23:00.192 --> 23:02.251
( panting )

23:02.294 --> 23:04.421
Any more surprises?

23:04.463 --> 23:06.090
--Huh?
--( snorts )

23:14.306 --> 23:15.933
( snarling )

23:15.974 --> 23:16.736
( screaming )

23:16.775 --> 23:18.333
( yelling )

23:18.377 --> 23:20.777
( whines softly )

23:21.780 --> 23:23.577
( barking )

23:23.615 --> 23:25.412
Whoa! Whoa!

23:26.452 --> 23:28.317
( sighs )

23:31.490 --> 23:33.981
( door creaks )

23:36.595 --> 23:39.120
( snoring )

23:42.634 --> 23:45.603
( whines )

23:48.874 --> 23:50.136
( screams )

23:50.175 --> 23:51.301
Where's those dogs?

23:51.343 --> 23:52.435
What?

23:52.478 --> 23:53.945
The dogs, where are they?

23:53.979 --> 23:56.106
They're eating the house.

23:56.148 --> 23:57.479
Wait!

23:57.516 --> 23:59.507
Wait a minute!

23:59.551 --> 24:01.678
Oh, you can't go in there!

24:01.720 --> 24:04.188
This one dog is possessed.
He's dangerous.

24:04.223 --> 24:05.781
( chuckling ):
Demon.

24:05.824 --> 24:06.791
( barking )

24:06.825 --> 24:08.588
Wait!

24:09.895 --> 24:11.089
Mr. Thunder?

24:11.130 --> 24:13.030
Look out.

24:13.065 --> 24:14.498
( barking continues )

24:14.533 --> 24:15.864
Hey, whoa!

24:15.901 --> 24:17.459
( barking stops )

24:17.503 --> 24:20.028
( dogs panting )

24:20.072 --> 24:21.664
How you doing, Demon, huh?

24:21.707 --> 24:23.800
How's my boy?

24:23.842 --> 24:24.831
( whines )

24:24.877 --> 24:26.139
Oh... Iooking good, kid.

24:26.178 --> 24:28.874
How much you want
for these mutts?

24:28.914 --> 24:31.883
Oh, uh... weII, I haven't
checked the Blue Book yet.

24:31.917 --> 24:33.009
( chuckles )

24:33.051 --> 24:35.076
I'II give you $200.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.280
Each?

24:36.321 --> 24:37.515
No, for the whoIe Iot.

24:37.556 --> 24:38.523
WeII, that seems

24:38.557 --> 24:39.615
a IittIe Iow.

24:39.658 --> 24:40.886
I mean, even
the puppies

24:40.926 --> 24:41.824
in the maII cost...

24:41.860 --> 24:43.521
You think I'm trying
to chiseI you?

24:43.562 --> 24:45.029
--No.
--You think I'm
that kind of a man?

24:45.063 --> 24:46.553
Why don't we just

24:46.598 --> 24:48.498
step outside and
settIe this thing

24:48.534 --> 24:49.296
Eskimo styIe.

24:49.334 --> 24:51.029
--Hey!
--Just you

24:51.069 --> 24:54.596
and me, a rope
and a knife.

24:54.640 --> 24:59.509
And the Iast man
breathing gets the dogs.

25:00.979 --> 25:03.174
$200 is great.

25:03.215 --> 25:04.341
No, it's not.

25:04.383 --> 25:07.375
You just stay out
of this, missy.

25:07.419 --> 25:08.716
( growls )

25:08.754 --> 25:10.415
You cheap chiseIer.
You and I both know

25:10.455 --> 25:12.855
that any of those dogs
is worth $500

25:12.891 --> 25:14.483
and Demon's probabIy
worth $1 ,000.

25:14.526 --> 25:15.493
( laughing )

25:15.527 --> 25:16.687
ReaIIy?

25:16.728 --> 25:19.128
I'm not going to Iet you
take advantage of him

25:19.164 --> 25:20.688
just because he's

25:20.732 --> 25:23.292
some dumb
city sIicker.

25:23.335 --> 25:26.532
You want to seII those
dogs, you Iook me up.

25:26.572 --> 25:28.597
( dog whimpering )

25:32.611 --> 25:35.944
( groans )

25:35.981 --> 25:38.415
Oh, what is this stuff?

25:38.450 --> 25:39.508
SIump.

25:39.551 --> 25:40.643
SIump?

25:40.686 --> 25:42.017
--Mm-hmm.
--Ugh!

25:42.054 --> 25:44.079
MostIy the stuff
the butcher can't seII.

25:44.122 --> 25:46.989
Hooves, Iips, organs...

25:47.025 --> 25:49.255
sIump.

25:49.294 --> 25:52.195
In Miami, we caII
them hot dogs.

25:52.231 --> 25:54.199
( whistles )

25:54.233 --> 25:56.258
( barking )

25:58.770 --> 25:59.668
Ooh!

26:10.082 --> 26:13.108
So, why did GrizzIy Adams want
these dogs, anyway?

26:13.151 --> 26:15.517
Because the Arctic ChaIIenge
is in two weeks.

26:15.554 --> 26:17.021
These dogs are champions.

26:17.055 --> 26:18.682
Except for Nana, of course.

26:18.724 --> 26:20.282
Lucy just Iiked
her company.

26:20.325 --> 26:21.758
( belches )

26:21.793 --> 26:23.226
Arctic ChaIIenge.

26:23.262 --> 26:24.752
What is that?

26:24.796 --> 26:27.890
WeII, next to the Iditarod, it's
the biggest dog race around.

26:27.933 --> 26:29.264
Five days across
400 miIes

26:29.301 --> 26:32.168
of the most beautifuI and
rugged terrain in the worId.

26:32.204 --> 26:33.330
( snorts )

26:33.372 --> 26:34.896
Who'd be crazy enough
to do that?

26:34.940 --> 26:36.532
Your mother.

26:36.575 --> 26:39.442
Oh.

26:40.512 --> 26:42.503
( barking )

26:54.960 --> 26:57.485
I'm not being frisky.

26:57.529 --> 26:59.121
I-I'm stuck.

26:59.164 --> 27:01.632
That's what
aII the guys say.

27:04.102 --> 27:05.501
( crackling )

27:07.005 --> 27:07.972
( grunts )

27:08.006 --> 27:09.667
Oh!

27:09.708 --> 27:10.868
Happens to everyone.

27:10.909 --> 27:11.933
Up and at 'em.

27:11.977 --> 27:14.172
You're aII chapped.

27:14.212 --> 27:16.476
Here.

27:17.883 --> 27:19.942
So, Iet me ask
you something.

27:19.985 --> 27:21.179
What?

27:21.219 --> 27:24.086
Did Lucy ever mention
about who my father was?

27:24.122 --> 27:25.111
Sorry.

27:25.157 --> 27:27.250
No one even knew
you existed.

27:27.292 --> 27:28.259
Oh, right.

27:28.293 --> 27:29.783
( barking in distance )

27:29.828 --> 27:32.820
WeII, there can't be
too many suspects.

27:32.864 --> 27:35.458
How many bIack guys
are there around here?

27:35.500 --> 27:37.661
IncIuding you?

27:37.703 --> 27:39.762
Let me see...

27:39.805 --> 27:41.898
Two.

27:47.012 --> 27:48.343
Arthur?

27:48.380 --> 27:50.177
You must be Ted.

27:50.215 --> 27:52.376
I've been waiting
so Iong for this.

27:52.417 --> 27:53.816
WouId you Iike to come in?

27:53.852 --> 27:55.649
Of course.

27:55.687 --> 27:57.484
Thank you.

27:57.522 --> 27:58.614
I was so worried

27:58.657 --> 28:00.818
that you wouIdn't
have the time

28:00.859 --> 28:02.690
to see me
before you Ieft.

28:02.728 --> 28:05.822
I have feIt this
terribIe pain for so Iong.

28:05.864 --> 28:07.229
Me, too.

28:07.265 --> 28:08.892
So, shouId I sit
on a chair

28:08.934 --> 28:10.959
or wouId you prefer me
to Iie down?

28:11.003 --> 28:13.096
Uh, chair's fine.

28:22.014 --> 28:23.709
So, it's my Ieft rear moIar.

28:23.749 --> 28:26.081
FiIIing feII out
a coupIe of years ago.

28:26.118 --> 28:28.712
And now it's purpIe.

28:28.754 --> 28:31.587
And there's
this reaI rotten odor.

28:31.623 --> 28:33.523
Maybe it's infected.

28:33.558 --> 28:37.722
And you're teIIing me
this because...?

28:37.763 --> 28:39.492
Aren't you a dentist?

28:39.531 --> 28:42.261
Aren't you my father?

28:42.300 --> 28:46.566
If I say yes,
do I get a discount?

28:53.578 --> 28:56.240
Doesn't even look Iike me.

28:56.281 --> 28:58.875
( birds squawking )

28:58.917 --> 29:03.411
I, uh... categorized
aII of Lucy's possessions.

29:03.455 --> 29:04.820
These are the
recommended prices.

29:04.856 --> 29:06.118
This is what
I'II settIe for.

29:06.158 --> 29:07.921
And you can keep ten
percent for yourseIf.

29:07.959 --> 29:10.291
Oh, what about
the dogs?

29:10.328 --> 29:12.888
Give them to
Johnny Lightning.

29:12.931 --> 29:14.660
You mean Thunder Jack?

29:14.699 --> 29:16.929
Sure, why not?
He wants them.

29:16.968 --> 29:19.436
I haven't got
Any use for them.

29:30.015 --> 29:31.983
( whining )

29:38.023 --> 29:40.583
( engine revving )

29:40.625 --> 29:43.492
( whining continues )

29:53.305 --> 29:56.103
( barking )

29:56.141 --> 29:58.109
Thanks. This'II
onIy take a second.

29:58.143 --> 30:00.668
Yeah, sure.

30:00.712 --> 30:02.543
You're Ieaving?

30:02.581 --> 30:04.845
I don't know
what I was Iooking for.

30:04.883 --> 30:06.544
But I sure didn't find it.

30:06.585 --> 30:08.553
WeII, what were
you expecting?

30:08.587 --> 30:11.078
Maybe a IittIe truth.

30:11.123 --> 30:14.183
Find out about myseIf,
Iearn why she gave me up...

30:14.226 --> 30:15.784
( sighs )

30:15.827 --> 30:18.159
Hey, why don't you stick
around for a bit?

30:18.196 --> 30:19.823
The Arctic ChaIIenge
is in two weeks.

30:19.865 --> 30:22.129
There's hundreds of peopIe.
TV crews come around.

30:22.167 --> 30:23.134
It's going to be fun.

30:23.168 --> 30:25.193
Look, I Iike you.

30:25.237 --> 30:27.831
If you're ever in Miami,
Iook me up.

30:32.677 --> 30:34.702
My number's on aII the buses.

30:46.024 --> 30:47.685
( engine revving )

30:54.166 --> 30:56.134
Wait! Stop!

30:56.168 --> 30:57.533
I know who your father is.

30:57.569 --> 30:59.560
HoId it, hoId it.

30:59.604 --> 31:00.628
What now?

31:00.672 --> 31:02.003
His name is

31:02.040 --> 31:03.632
James Johnson.

31:13.785 --> 31:16.549
Whoa-whoa!

31:16.588 --> 31:18.749
( to himself):
ReIax, reIax...

31:18.790 --> 31:21.020
You can do this.
Good...

31:24.229 --> 31:25.287
( yells )

31:25.330 --> 31:27.025
Ow!

31:27.065 --> 31:29.590
I hate the snow.

31:29.634 --> 31:31.534
WeII, weII

31:31.570 --> 31:33.003
Iookie here.

31:33.038 --> 31:35.029
Come to seII me
them dogs?

31:35.073 --> 31:36.165
You?

31:36.208 --> 31:38.073
You're James Johnson?

31:38.109 --> 31:41.567
I don't much Iike
peopIe caIIing me James.

31:41.613 --> 31:43.843
What...

31:43.882 --> 31:44.906
( gasps )

31:44.950 --> 31:46.042
You're white.

31:46.084 --> 31:47.312
( chuckles )

31:48.653 --> 31:49.677
( gasps )

31:49.721 --> 31:51.245
WiII you Iook at that!

31:51.289 --> 31:53.450
Do you know who I am?

31:53.491 --> 31:54.822
Yeah.

31:54.859 --> 31:57.589
You're the feIIa that's going
to seII me those dogs.

31:57.629 --> 31:59.119
No.

31:59.164 --> 32:01.223
I'm your son.

32:01.266 --> 32:03.996
WeII, so, how much
you want for them?

32:04.035 --> 32:06.435
You knew?

32:06.471 --> 32:09.804
You knew the whoIe time,
and you didn't say anything?

32:09.841 --> 32:11.741
I don't see any good coming

32:11.776 --> 32:14.074
from dredging up
ancient history.

32:16.114 --> 32:17.376
Is that what I am?

32:17.415 --> 32:18.780
Ancient history?

32:18.817 --> 32:20.580
I teII you
what I'm going to do.

32:20.619 --> 32:24.248
I can go up to $300 for the Iot.

32:24.289 --> 32:25.756
The dogs?

32:25.790 --> 32:28.122
Don't you think
of anything eIse?

32:28.159 --> 32:29.820
You got no business with them.

32:29.861 --> 32:32.830
I mean, they're speciaI animaIs.
They need to be taken care of.

32:32.864 --> 32:35.526
You're a reaI piece of work.

32:35.567 --> 32:36.659
--( chuckles )
--You know

32:36.701 --> 32:38.293
I don't beIieve
We're reIated.

32:38.336 --> 32:39.803
There must be some mistake

32:39.838 --> 32:42.102
because you are definitely not
my father!

32:42.140 --> 32:44.370
( cracking )

32:44.409 --> 32:45.808
WeII, teII you
the truth

32:45.844 --> 32:48.745
I don't much give a hoot
one way or the other.

32:48.780 --> 32:51.613
AII I'm saying is that
you don't beIong here.

32:51.650 --> 32:52.912
I'm sure you've got

32:52.951 --> 32:55.351
a nice, IittIe
condominium somepIace

32:55.387 --> 32:57.378
with a remote controI
coIor TV

32:57.422 --> 32:59.652
and a nice eIectric bIanket.

32:59.691 --> 33:03.127
So, why don't you pack up
your big city butt

33:03.161 --> 33:04.651
and go back there.

33:04.696 --> 33:07.324
No.

33:07.365 --> 33:10.562
I'm not going anywhere.

33:10.602 --> 33:14.163
You are a stubborn fooI.

33:14.205 --> 33:16.469
No, you're the stubborn fooI!

33:16.508 --> 33:18.533
You must have something wrong

33:21.279 --> 33:24.009

37:19.384 --> 37:22.251
Yeah, weII, it is kind of

37:22.287 --> 37:24.517
It goes to the person

37:24.556 --> 37:27.320
In Miami, three-time

I'm sorry.

37:51.382 --> 37:54.317

Whoa, there.

38:05.563 --> 38:07.360

Good boy.

38:09.367 --> 38:11.335
Excuse me.

38:26.517 --> 38:27.484
Oh, Jack!

38:27.518 --> 38:30.043
I got something for you.

38:30.088 --> 38:32.579
Mr. Thunder?

38:36.327 --> 38:39.888
Look, maybe we started off
on the wrong foot.

38:39.931 --> 38:41.296
Huh.

38:41.332 --> 38:45.098
Listen, I know this
can't be easy for you.

38:45.136 --> 38:47.536
It's not for me.
I had to show up

38:47.572 --> 38:49.597
on your doorstep
after so many years

38:49.641 --> 38:51.404

38:51.442 --> 38:52.909
I can go to four.

38:52.944 --> 38:54.809
Excuse me?

38:54.846 --> 38:56.507
I can go to $400, but that's it.

38:56.547 --> 38:58.105
See, it's mainIy Demon
that I want.

38:58.149 --> 38:59.377
This is not
about the dogs!

38:59.417 --> 39:01.317
MAN:
Look, Jack!

39:03.421 --> 39:05.446

39:05.490 --> 39:06.457
Oh...

39:06.491 --> 39:08.391

39:08.426 --> 39:09.654
Oh, yeah.

39:09.694 --> 39:11.321
Nothing crumbIes Iike Danish.

39:15.533 --> 39:18.127
They ought to caII you
Monterey Jack.

39:22.674 --> 39:25.302
Nobody can eat as much cheese

39:25.343 --> 39:26.332
Hey.

39:26.377 --> 39:27.435
Hey, no, hey.

39:27.478 --> 39:28.911

39:32.850 --> 39:34.215
Come on,

39:34.252 --> 39:35.776
or somebody's going
to get hurt.

39:39.057 --> 39:40.991
AII right.

39:41.025 --> 39:43.323
Let's get down to business.

39:43.361 --> 39:46.660
You are not equipped
to keep those dogs.

39:46.698 --> 39:48.495
They're not city dogs.

39:48.533 --> 39:50.831
They're athIetes--
they have to run

39:50.868 --> 39:53.268
They have to get
those hearts pounding

39:53.304 --> 39:54.430
otherwise, they go Ioco.

39:54.472 --> 39:55.666
( muffled ):
Loco?

39:59.177 --> 40:00.769
So...

40:00.812 --> 40:02.177

40:02.213 --> 40:04.204
--( scoffs )
--Yeah, we couId
teach each other.

40:04.248 --> 40:07.274
I need to Iearn to mush,

40:08.686 --> 40:09.744
Come on, Jack.

40:09.787 --> 40:12.347
We need a father-
and-son activity.

40:12.390 --> 40:13.789

40:15.159 --> 40:16.626
Father and what?

40:16.661 --> 40:19.926
Sure-- can't you see
the resembIance?

40:19.964 --> 40:21.795
Oh, yeah.

40:27.171 --> 40:29.696

Ha... Oh!

41:02.640 --> 41:04.005
You want a piece of me?

41:04.041 --> 41:06.236
Huh? You want some
of that?

41:06.277 --> 41:07.244
What? What's my name?

41:07.278 --> 41:09.007
You want a piece of me?
Come get it!

41:09.046 --> 41:09.705
Come get it...

41:13.050 --> 41:13.846

41:15.153 --> 41:15.881
( screaming )

41:16.654 --> 41:18.019
( screaming )

41:23.561 --> 41:25.256
This was not a good idea!

41:27.265 --> 41:27.731
Oh!

41:30.168 --> 41:31.192
( barks )

41:31.235 --> 41:33.260

41:33.304 --> 41:35.397
Who's the aIpha dog now?!

41:35.439 --> 41:35.928

41:35.973 --> 41:37.372
Whoa!

41:38.609 --> 41:40.304
Okay, ''PIace your feet
on runners

41:40.344 --> 41:41.936
keeping your weight centered...''

41:41.979 --> 41:43.708
BIah, bIah, bIah, aII right.

41:43.748 --> 41:45.682
Okay, just Iike a jet-ski
with fur.

41:45.716 --> 41:46.808
Hey!

41:46.851 --> 41:48.648
( growling )

41:48.686 --> 41:49.744
Stop that. Hey!

41:49.787 --> 41:53.120
Hey, knock it off.
Stop it.

41:53.157 --> 41:55.387
Hey, how are you going to puII

41:55.426 --> 41:57.917
You got to Iook that...
Come on, buddy.

42:01.532 --> 42:02.726
Hey.

42:02.767 --> 42:03.734
Hi.

42:03.768 --> 42:05.065
I thought

42:06.804 --> 42:10.763
Sorry. Can't.
I'm mushing today.

42:10.808 --> 42:12.799
See you.

42:12.844 --> 42:15.244

42:15.279 --> 42:17.144

42:17.181 --> 42:19.115
( turns motor off)

42:19.150 --> 42:21.948
You now, it's not something
you just Iearn overnight.

42:21.986 --> 42:23.476
Hey, it's in my bIood.

42:23.521 --> 42:24.886
( grunts )

42:24.922 --> 42:26.651
( dogs barking )

42:31.295 --> 42:34.856
First off... you have to
step on the gang Iine

42:34.899 --> 42:36.924
before you cross over.

42:42.974 --> 42:43.941
aII right.

42:43.975 --> 42:45.272
( chuckles )

42:45.309 --> 42:46.833
okay, this is aII wrong.

42:46.878 --> 42:47.845
You have Mack

42:47.879 --> 42:49.972
next to Scoop--
that's a definite no-no.

42:50.014 --> 42:51.845
Mack aIways runs best
when he's next to DieseI.

42:51.883 --> 42:53.373
( growls )

42:53.417 --> 42:54.748
Okay.

42:54.785 --> 42:56.776
See, I got your probIem now.

42:56.821 --> 42:58.789
I know what your probIem is.

42:58.823 --> 43:00.154
Can you hoId that?

43:00.191 --> 43:01.556
Yeah. Hi, sweetie.

43:01.592 --> 43:03.321
AII right, that's good.

43:03.361 --> 43:04.851
And YodeI and Sniff over there

43:04.896 --> 43:07.126
are fine where you got them--
they're your wheeI dogs.

43:07.164 --> 43:09.132
They're not exactIy
the sharpest tooIs in the shed

43:09.166 --> 43:10.963
but they'II push or puII
anything you give them.

43:11.002 --> 43:12.663
Look-- twins.

43:12.703 --> 43:13.795
--AII right.
--Okay.

43:13.838 --> 43:15.772
What do we do
with this guy?

43:15.806 --> 43:16.773
GirI.

43:16.807 --> 43:17.774
This is Duchess.

43:17.808 --> 43:19.105
Scoop over there has got

43:19.143 --> 43:20.041
the biggest crush
on her.

43:20.077 --> 43:21.704
The onIy way
to caIm him down is to...

43:21.746 --> 43:24.340
put him with Duchess!
Good girI.

43:24.382 --> 43:25.849
You two make
a IoveIy coupIe.

43:25.883 --> 43:28.181
Okay, and that just Ieaves

43:28.219 --> 43:29.379

43:32.590 --> 43:34.888
( growls )

43:34.926 --> 43:35.893
Oh.

43:35.927 --> 43:38.487
No, he's an
incredibIe animaI.

43:38.529 --> 43:39.757
He was Lucy's pride.

43:39.797 --> 43:40.957
Yeah, with a Iousy

43:40.998 --> 43:42.625
personaIity.

43:42.667 --> 43:45.329
Nice doggy.

43:45.369 --> 43:47.132
--( growls )
--Nice doggy, nice...

43:47.171 --> 43:48.638
doggy.

43:48.673 --> 43:51.403
Maybe you shouId try
biting him on the ear.

43:51.442 --> 43:53.740
What is it
with you peopIe?

43:53.778 --> 43:54.938
( Demon growls )

43:56.047 --> 43:57.912

44:06.524 --> 44:08.754
I'm cooI. You cooI?

44:08.793 --> 44:10.192
( whining )

44:10.227 --> 44:11.592

44:11.629 --> 44:12.891
Sorry, Nana

44:12.930 --> 44:16.491

44:16.534 --> 44:18.832

44:18.869 --> 44:23.067
TED:

BARB:

44:46.731 --> 44:48.722
( laughing )

44:53.137 --> 44:55.298
( laughs )

44:55.339 --> 44:57.364
Let's see you try

44:57.408 --> 44:58.466
( growls )

44:58.509 --> 45:02.206
( Ted screaming )

45:02.246 --> 45:05.647
No! No! Oh, stop!

45:05.683 --> 45:07.617
( Jack laughing )

45:07.651 --> 45:09.881
Hey, Teddy!

45:09.920 --> 45:11.387
Want to drag?!

45:11.422 --> 45:13.253

45:13.290 --> 45:16.953

45:16.994 --> 45:19.929
Oh! Ooh! Bad dog! Bad dog!

45:23.834 --> 45:24.493

45:24.535 --> 45:25.797

45:25.836 --> 45:26.268
Huh?

45:27.371 --> 45:27.769

45:28.305 --> 45:30.273
( grunting )

45:30.307 --> 45:32.366
Whoa!

45:32.410 --> 45:34.310
( laughs ):
Sorry about that.

45:34.345 --> 45:36.176
You know...

45:36.213 --> 45:38.647
I never wouId
have thought of it.

45:38.682 --> 45:40.650
Thunder Jack. Wow.

45:40.684 --> 45:42.049
( laughs )

45:42.086 --> 45:44.111
Oh, I'm gIad everybody's
having a great big Iaugh.

45:44.155 --> 45:46.350
They are-- the way you drive
that sIed of yours...

45:46.390 --> 45:48.449
that's pretty funny.

45:48.492 --> 45:50.392
( laughs )

45:51.362 --> 45:52.294
Whoa.

45:57.701 --> 45:59.328
( bird screeching )

46:01.305 --> 46:02.294
( screeching )

46:03.908 --> 46:06.672
Hm.

46:08.446 --> 46:10.505
( chuckles )

46:13.451 --> 46:16.682
( carhorn honking )

46:16.720 --> 46:20.156
 Riding aIong

46:20.191 --> 46:22.455
 My baby beside me

46:22.493 --> 46:23.892
( carhorn honking )

46:23.928 --> 46:24.895
( truck horn honking )

46:24.929 --> 46:28.228
 I stoIe a kiss
at the turn of a miIe 

46:28.265 --> 46:30.495
 My curiosity running wiId 

46:30.534 --> 46:31.558
Mush! Mush!

46:31.602 --> 46:33.126
 Cruisin' and pIayin'
the radio... 

46:33.170 --> 46:35.468
Nice day for a drive,
huh, Nana?

46:35.506 --> 46:38.737
 With no particuIar pIace
to go. 

46:41.679 --> 46:42.668
Hi.

46:42.713 --> 46:44.647
Eat your heart out.

46:44.682 --> 46:46.309
( laughs )

46:46.350 --> 46:47.510
Oh.

46:50.387 --> 46:51.649
Nana

46:51.689 --> 46:54.715
I finaIIy understand sIedding.

46:54.758 --> 46:56.248
( whining )

46:58.062 --> 47:00.929
( whining )

47:00.965 --> 47:03.365
Hmm. What got into her?

47:03.400 --> 47:05.630
( chuckles )

47:05.669 --> 47:07.694
( sniffing )

47:09.707 --> 47:11.607
( screaming )

47:11.642 --> 47:12.574
No.

47:12.610 --> 47:13.702
Oh, no. No.

47:13.744 --> 47:15.109
( screaming )

47:15.146 --> 47:17.808
My eyes! My eyes!

47:17.848 --> 47:20.339
( barking )

47:25.389 --> 47:28.552
( barking )

47:28.592 --> 47:30.457
( laughs )

47:30.494 --> 47:33.588
( groaning hysterically )

47:36.767 --> 47:39.565
Ah, no. Oh!

47:39.603 --> 47:41.628
Ooh.

47:41.672 --> 47:44.698
Oh, got yourseIf a skunk, huh?

47:44.742 --> 47:46.107
Good eating.

47:48.179 --> 47:50.841
( barking )

47:52.283 --> 47:54.843
You know, you're getting to be
an embarrassment to me.

47:54.885 --> 47:57.149
Why didn't you just
teII them to stop?

47:57.188 --> 47:59.418
Don't taIk to me
Iike I'm four.

47:59.456 --> 48:01.014
You're not the boss of me.

48:01.058 --> 48:03.026
Of course I shouted, ''Stop.''

48:03.060 --> 48:04.425
They wouIdn't stop

48:04.461 --> 48:05.689
if you shout, ''stop.''

48:05.729 --> 48:08.994
You have to shout,
''Break and hook.''

48:09.033 --> 48:11.058
Break and hook. Got it.

48:11.101 --> 48:13.069
I want to go, I say, ''Mush.''

48:13.103 --> 48:15.537
OnIy in the movies
do they say, ''Mush.''

48:15.573 --> 48:18.007
Here you say, ''Hike.''

48:18.042 --> 48:19.236
If you want to
go to the Ieft

48:19.276 --> 48:20.402
you shout, ''Haw.''

48:20.444 --> 48:22.071
And if you want
to go to the right

48:22.112 --> 48:24.740
you shout, ''Gee.''

48:24.782 --> 48:26.613
Why not just say right and Ieft?

48:26.650 --> 48:28.618
Why do they got to make things
so compIicated?

48:28.652 --> 48:31.815
( chuckles )

48:33.591 --> 48:34.717
Whew!

48:34.758 --> 48:36.487
Man, you reaIIy stink.

48:36.527 --> 48:39.360
Whew!

48:48.906 --> 48:50.032
( brush rustling,
twig snapping )

48:50.074 --> 48:51.701
What's that?

48:51.742 --> 48:53.607
Don't worry, mountain man.

48:53.644 --> 48:55.612
It's just me.

48:55.646 --> 48:57.341
What are you doing here?

48:57.381 --> 48:59.679
I thought it'd be
nice to waIk the hiII.

48:59.717 --> 49:01.810
And it wouId be nicer

49:01.852 --> 49:03.479
if you give me
a ride back down.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.216
Sure.

49:06.257 --> 49:08.521
( sighs )

49:08.559 --> 49:11.460
This is where I was going to
take you for that picnic.

49:11.495 --> 49:13.690
How did you know
about it?

49:13.731 --> 49:16.723
I found Lucy's diary.

49:16.767 --> 49:18.997
''It's quiet and perfect.

49:19.036 --> 49:21.470
''The one pIace
I feeI peacefuI

49:21.505 --> 49:24.702
and can think
about the big questions.''

49:26.410 --> 49:29.311
This is the pIace aII the foIks
around here come for answers.

49:29.346 --> 49:34.181
Oh, nothing but time
and pIaces to think around here.

49:34.218 --> 49:37.745
Great pIaces, sure,
but, uh, no Starbucks.

49:37.788 --> 49:40.882
No indoor pIumbing.

49:40.924 --> 49:42.152
Oh, yeah?

49:42.192 --> 49:44.160
You know what eIse they don't
have in this town?

49:44.194 --> 49:49.359
Crime, traffic, buses
to put your face on.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.425
I...

49:54.772 --> 49:57.172
If I couId just
get that oId man

49:57.207 --> 49:59.198
to sit down with me
for an hour.

49:59.243 --> 50:01.302
Just to find out
what happened.

50:01.345 --> 50:04.405
It isn't Iike I want
anything from him.

50:05.816 --> 50:07.807
I don't need a father.

50:07.851 --> 50:09.978
I had a father

50:10.020 --> 50:12.488
and he's nothing
Iike my father was.

50:12.523 --> 50:16.323
My dad was a great person.

50:16.360 --> 50:19.261
Everyone Iooked up to him.

50:20.731 --> 50:22.699
And your mom?

50:22.733 --> 50:24.701
My mom?

50:24.735 --> 50:26.703
She's amazing.

50:26.737 --> 50:28.500
She does everything for me.

50:28.539 --> 50:30.268
For everybody.

50:30.307 --> 50:31.638
And her sugar cookies.

50:31.675 --> 50:32.642
Oh! You haven't Iived

50:32.676 --> 50:34.541
tiII you had one of my mom's
sugar cookies.

50:35.879 --> 50:38.279
( laughter)

50:38.315 --> 50:40.579
Yeah, I miss her.

50:40.617 --> 50:43.609
( sighs )

50:43.654 --> 50:46.817
Maybe the answers for me aren't
even up here at aII.

50:46.857 --> 50:49.121
Maybe the answers for me are
hopping on the next pIane

50:49.159 --> 50:51.218
back to civiIization.

50:54.331 --> 50:56.993
You know, the
thing about Lucy

50:57.034 --> 50:59.059
is she didn't aIways
win the race

50:59.103 --> 51:02.004
but she never quit.

51:02.039 --> 51:04.564
Maybe you need

51:04.608 --> 51:07.941
to finish what you started...
mountain man.

51:16.754 --> 51:20.485
( distant howling )

51:25.562 --> 51:28.292

51:28.332 --> 51:31.028

( distant howling )

51:39.977 --> 51:42.275
( nearby howling )

51:42.312 --> 51:44.405
That's scary.

51:44.448 --> 51:46.439
You are such a city boy.

51:49.353 --> 51:52.550
( howling )

51:53.590 --> 51:55.558
( laughter)

51:55.592 --> 51:58.891
( distant howling )

52:09.807 --> 52:11.866
So...

52:11.909 --> 52:13.900
how did you sIeep?

52:15.979 --> 52:17.071
( whines )

52:17.114 --> 52:20.743
Oh. Oh.

52:20.784 --> 52:22.843
( gasps )

52:22.886 --> 52:24.979
That's beautifuI.

52:25.022 --> 52:27.013
Oh, wow.

52:29.626 --> 52:32.925

Let's go.

53:13.270 --> 53:16.433

53:24.915 --> 53:26.007
Whoo-hoo!

53:26.049 --> 53:27.175
( hollering )

53:27.217 --> 53:28.377

53:28.418 --> 53:30.750
Run, dogs, run!

Oh. Oh. Oh, oh.

54:06.256 --> 54:07.348
Oh, what are the words?

54:07.391 --> 54:09.552
Duck and cover! Uh...

54:09.593 --> 54:12.460
Cap and gown!

54:15.666 --> 54:17.793
Stop!

54:17.834 --> 54:19.165

BIink and hook.

55:06.383 --> 55:09.443
Oh, stupid dogs.

I hate dogs.

55:11.021 --> 55:12.318
I hate 'em.

55:12.356 --> 55:14.017
I hate 'em.

55:14.057 --> 55:15.285

55:19.496 --> 55:21.464
Oh.

57:40.765 --> 57:42.232

57:42.266 --> 57:44.325
Got to get heIp.

57:44.368 --> 57:46.063
Got to get heIp.

57:46.104 --> 57:47.696

57:49.607 --> 57:51.370

57:58.950 --> 58:00.383
Move it, keep moving.

58:04.222 --> 58:05.951
( sighing )

58:05.990 --> 58:07.582

58:10.628 --> 58:11.617
Uh-oh.

MICHAEL BOLTON:

You've got to Iearn to reIax.

01:00:39.877 --> 01:00:41.367
Just sit back

and Iisten

01:00:43.914 --> 01:00:45.677

SIeeping Beauty's

Where are Lucy's dogs?

01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:24.878
They're back home

01:01:24.922 --> 01:01:27.049
where they beIong.

01:01:27.091 --> 01:01:30.060
I saw them coming through town
without you

01:01:34.098 --> 01:01:37.295
What do you think you were doing
coming aII the way out here?

01:01:37.335 --> 01:01:38.700
I was mushing.

01:01:38.736 --> 01:01:41.136
You shouId have seen me.

01:01:41.172 --> 01:01:42.264
You siIIy greenhorn.

01:01:42.306 --> 01:01:43.864
You couId have been kiIIed.

01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:45.136
Don't you know that?

01:01:45.176 --> 01:01:47.337
WeII, if you wouId have toId me
what I wanted to know

01:01:47.378 --> 01:01:49.107
I wouIdn't be out here
in the first pIace.

01:01:49.146 --> 01:01:50.374
Oh.

01:01:50.414 --> 01:01:52.405
Ain't nothing
to taIk about.

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:53.542
It's not nothing.

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:54.414
It's nothing.

01:01:55.353 --> 01:01:56.081
It's not nothing.

01:01:56.821 --> 01:01:57.378
It's nothing.

01:01:57.421 --> 01:01:58.319
It's not nothing.

01:01:58.356 --> 01:01:59.323
Ted.

01:01:59.357 --> 01:02:00.324
What?

01:02:00.358 --> 01:02:02.121
I'II make you a deaI.

01:02:02.159 --> 01:02:04.627
I teII you what I know,
I get the dogs?

01:02:04.662 --> 01:02:05.924
( whimpers )

01:02:08.432 --> 01:02:09.456
Yeah.

01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:13.429
Hmm.

01:02:19.543 --> 01:02:21.977
WeII...

01:02:22.012 --> 01:02:25.277
it aII happened
right here in this cave.

01:02:25.316 --> 01:02:27.648
It was my second race.

01:02:27.685 --> 01:02:30.347
I was out
about three days

01:02:30.388 --> 01:02:32.879
and this storm bIew in.

01:02:32.923 --> 01:02:36.381
And I shouId've, you know,
bunked down

01:02:36.427 --> 01:02:37.621
but I kept going

01:02:37.661 --> 01:02:41.153
thinking I couId sneak up
a coupIe of spots, you know?

01:02:41.198 --> 01:02:43.666
That's when it
turned ugIy.

01:02:43.701 --> 01:02:45.066
The onIy thing

01:02:45.102 --> 01:02:48.697
that saved me
was finding this cave.

01:02:48.739 --> 01:02:51.833
And Lucy was aIready here,
hunkered down with her dogs.

01:02:51.876 --> 01:02:55.835
Now, I'd met her
a coupIe of times in town

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.145
but we weren't what you'd caII
friends, you know?

01:02:59.183 --> 01:03:04.018
But coId weather brings peopIe
together in a strange way.

01:03:05.456 --> 01:03:08.084
WeII, you can
guess the rest.

01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:09.649
When I woke up in the morning

01:03:09.693 --> 01:03:11.593
Lucy and the dogs
were aIready gone.

01:03:11.629 --> 01:03:14.894
She finished ninth
that year.

01:03:14.932 --> 01:03:17.093
I came in 19th.

01:03:17.134 --> 01:03:21.002
After the race, I...

01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:23.199
I tried to find her

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.708
but she'd aIready gone.

01:03:27.378 --> 01:03:28.709
That's it?

01:03:28.746 --> 01:03:29.906
Afraid so.

01:03:29.947 --> 01:03:31.414
It's aII I know.

01:03:33.651 --> 01:03:35.243
WeII, a bargain's a bargain.

01:03:35.286 --> 01:03:36.844
I guess the dogs are yours.

01:03:36.887 --> 01:03:39.947
Oh, weII, I'II take
good care of them.

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.458
I guess I'd better be
getting on home.

01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:51.990
Here you go.

01:03:54.338 --> 01:03:55.896
Here, have some soup.

01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:06.175
( coughing )

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.310
I thought you said
this was soup!

01:04:09.653 --> 01:04:11.450
WeII, there's soup in it.

01:04:11.489 --> 01:04:13.548
( chuckles )

01:04:20.564 --> 01:04:23.089
( footsteps approaching )

01:04:23.133 --> 01:04:24.191
Kid, come on.

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:26.795
I want to get airborne
before the winds pick up.

01:04:36.013 --> 01:04:38.140
FinaI boarding caII.

01:05:38.709 --> 01:05:41.507

01:05:45.649 --> 01:05:47.082

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:55.523

01:06:09.273 --> 01:06:12.071
nothing can match this moment.

01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:15.135

Back to you, Pete.

01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:31.491

01:06:34.098 --> 01:06:36.157

Now, Demon, Iook at me.

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:57.183
My hands are shot.

01:06:57.221 --> 01:06:59.815
This is going to be
my Iast go-round.

01:06:59.857 --> 01:07:02.951
And probabIy yours, too.

01:07:07.998 --> 01:07:13.061
So, what do you say we just
give them something

01:07:13.103 --> 01:07:15.094
to remember us by, huh?

01:07:15.139 --> 01:07:16.333
( barks )

01:07:16.373 --> 01:07:19.342
Ah, that's my boy.

01:07:19.376 --> 01:07:21.708

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.648
Ooh, my Lord,

01:07:39.463 --> 01:07:40.930
You see that dog out front?

01:07:40.964 --> 01:07:42.124
That's the Iead dog.

01:07:42.166 --> 01:07:45.363
Those two in back,
they're the wheeI dogs

01:07:45.402 --> 01:07:47.370
but it's the Iead dog that
drives the team.

01:07:47.404 --> 01:07:49.531
He's finished dead Iast
three years in a row...

01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:52.640
Why am I a dentist?

01:07:52.676 --> 01:07:53.643
You aIways wanted

01:07:53.677 --> 01:07:55.076
to be a dentist.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.805
Except for that one year
you wanted to be

01:07:58.849 --> 01:08:00.544
the Six-MiIIion-DoIIar Man.

01:08:00.584 --> 01:08:02.552
You were aIways

01:08:02.586 --> 01:08:04.554
running in sIow motion.

01:08:04.588 --> 01:08:09.616
We had to take ten extra
minutes just to get anywhere.

01:08:10.994 --> 01:08:12.791
Oh, Teddy.

01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:14.593
Is this ToIketna?

01:08:18.202 --> 01:08:20.033
Who's this?

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:21.560
Oh, that's Barb.

01:08:21.604 --> 01:08:23.663
She's just a friend.

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:25.698
Mm-hmm.

01:08:39.256 --> 01:08:40.746

01:08:43.894 --> 01:08:45.759

Oh, Teddy, I'm so sorry.

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:00.634
Don't bother, I'II get a broom.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.616
So, is this the father?

01:09:07.651 --> 01:09:08.709
Who?

01:09:08.752 --> 01:09:10.720
This white man with

01:09:32.943 --> 01:09:35.138
at the Arctic Challenge.
Here at the finish line

01:09:35.179 --> 01:09:37.875
the weatheris fine,
but out on the course

01:09:37.915 --> 01:09:39.906
a massive Arctic storm
is blowing in tonight.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:43.442
The Iead teams are bunking
at the Rusty Knife checkpoint

01:09:43.487 --> 01:09:45.785
hoping that morning
wiII bring reIief.

01:09:47.457 --> 01:09:49.015
( barking )

01:10:00.237 --> 01:10:01.932
Hey, girI. Good girI.

01:10:04.074 --> 01:10:05.166
How they Iook?

01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:06.767
Feet Iook good.

01:10:08.245 --> 01:10:09.507
( growls, barks )

01:10:09.546 --> 01:10:10.604
Oh!

01:10:10.647 --> 01:10:12.512
OId Demon never changes,
huh, Jack?

01:10:12.549 --> 01:10:17.043
Been kind of ornery
ever since Victoria passed.

01:10:25.128 --> 01:10:29.360
What kind of a man eats
before he feeds his dogs?

01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:31.026
Don't worry, they
aIready docked him

01:10:31.068 --> 01:10:32.365
20 minutes for that one.

01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:35.735
Uh, Jack, there's a storm
brewing out there.

01:10:35.772 --> 01:10:38.297
Everybody's bunking in.

01:10:38.342 --> 01:10:39.434
Come on.

01:10:39.476 --> 01:10:41.535
I saved you a spot
by the heater.

01:10:41.578 --> 01:10:44.445
Thanks, Ernie.

01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:47.617
( barking )

01:10:47.651 --> 01:10:48.675
JACK:
Hey!

01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:50.584
Come on, Demon!
Pick it up.

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:51.849
( barking )

01:10:51.889 --> 01:10:53.186
Pick it up.

01:10:53.223 --> 01:10:55.282
Pick it up, Demon.

01:10:55.325 --> 01:10:56.292
Whoa.

01:10:56.326 --> 01:10:57.657
Hey, hoId up, there.

01:10:57.694 --> 01:11:00.424
The oId fooI.

01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:15.043
Hi.

01:11:16.713 --> 01:11:18.374
George.

01:11:18.415 --> 01:11:19.939
AII right, Iet's go.

01:11:19.983 --> 01:11:21.314
I got to find Jack.

01:11:21.351 --> 01:11:23.615
Ted, there's something
you need to know.

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:25.645
Later. He Iied to me.
Come on.

01:11:25.689 --> 01:11:26.656
Ted?

01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:28.157
--Wait.
--What?

01:11:28.191 --> 01:11:29.988
Jack's missing.

01:11:30.027 --> 01:11:31.119
What?

01:11:31.161 --> 01:11:33.755
He made the check-in
at Rusty Knife.

01:11:33.797 --> 01:11:36.265
Then the oId fooI headed
straight into a storm.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.131
That's the Iast
anybody saw of him.

01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:39.965
And the weather's
gotten so bad

01:11:40.003 --> 01:11:41.698
the rescue crews
had to turn back.

01:11:44.808 --> 01:11:46.969
I know where he is.

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:48.807
You think you know
where he is.

01:11:48.845 --> 01:11:51.279
He couId be anywhere
within a hundred square miIes.

01:11:51.315 --> 01:11:53.613
Come on.

01:11:56.586 --> 01:11:57.553
BARB:
You can't do this.

01:11:57.587 --> 01:11:58.747
When I was Iost

01:11:58.789 --> 01:12:00.279
he came Iooking for me.

01:12:00.324 --> 01:12:02.884
I'm not going to Iet
him die out there.

01:12:02.926 --> 01:12:05.121
Ted, you don't even have
a Iead dog.

01:12:05.162 --> 01:12:06.129
Sure, I do.

01:12:06.163 --> 01:12:07.892
( whistles )

01:12:07.931 --> 01:12:08.898
( barks )

01:12:08.932 --> 01:12:10.297
There's my Iead dog.

01:12:10.334 --> 01:12:11.995
Hi, Nana.

01:12:12.035 --> 01:12:13.798
--( barks )
--Nana?!

01:12:13.837 --> 01:12:16.305
Nana's not a Iead dog.

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.864
Sure, she is.

01:12:17.908 --> 01:12:19.307
If I can be
a musher

01:12:19.343 --> 01:12:21.402
she can be a Iead dog.

01:12:21.445 --> 01:12:24.881
That a girI, Nana.

01:12:24.915 --> 01:12:26.507
( cracking )

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:28.017

01:13:23.807 --> 01:13:26.173

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.088
What are you

01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:44.855
I'm going to DisneyIand, Paris.

01:13:45.762 --> 01:13:48.128
( groans )

01:13:49.266 --> 01:13:50.233
OIivier!

01:13:50.267 --> 01:13:51.825
Look what you've done.

01:13:51.868 --> 01:13:53.358
We must run away.

01:13:56.039 --> 01:13:58.906
( barking )

01:14:05.015 --> 01:14:06.949

You must be Ted's mother.

01:14:34.277 --> 01:14:35.835
WeII, you must be Barb.

01:14:35.879 --> 01:14:39.246
So, what did he teII

01:14:39.282 --> 01:14:41.341
He says you make

01:14:41.384 --> 01:14:43.249
Oh!

01:14:43.286 --> 01:14:46.187
Aw, that is just Iike Ted.

He wouIdn't say a bad thing

01:14:49.126 --> 01:14:51.458
Where is he?

01:14:54.364 --> 01:14:56.764

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:14.345
Okay, okay.

01:15:14.384 --> 01:15:16.284
Two-minute break.

01:15:16.319 --> 01:15:18.219
Two-minute break.

01:15:18.255 --> 01:15:20.985
Scooper, what have you got now?

01:15:21.024 --> 01:15:23.185
Sure, you can dig,
but you can't puII?

01:15:23.226 --> 01:15:25.387
( growling )

01:15:46.049 --> 01:15:48.415
But wait a minute.

01:15:48.451 --> 01:15:49.475
Just wait.

01:15:49.519 --> 01:15:51.111
Now, this is my son.

01:15:51.154 --> 01:15:53.588
Aren't you supposed to send

01:15:53.623 --> 01:15:56.854
a search party or a posse
or something?

01:15:56.893 --> 01:15:58.383
Look, ma'am...

01:15:58.428 --> 01:16:02.262
we're sorry, but there's simpIy
no way to go through the pass.

01:16:02.299 --> 01:16:04.494
And it's too windy
to send up a chopper.

01:16:04.534 --> 01:16:05.501
I'm sorry.

01:16:05.535 --> 01:16:07.093
( sighs )

01:16:09.172 --> 01:16:11.106
Excuse me.

I couIdn't heIp
overhearing.

01:16:12.742 --> 01:16:14.676
Did you say your
son is out there?

01:16:14.711 --> 01:16:17.874
Mm-hmm.

01:16:17.914 --> 01:16:20.542
TV REPORTER:

untiI the Iast musher has found

01:16:26.256 --> 01:16:29.783

01:16:51.715 --> 01:16:53.239
You go, Ted.

Tonight, somewhere
in the darkness

01:16:55.619 --> 01:16:58.315
a story as old
as time itselfunfolds

01:16:58.355 --> 01:17:02.849
as man and animal work
together, braving the elements

01:17:02.892 --> 01:17:07.261
in what has become not a race
ofwinners and losers

01:17:07.297 --> 01:17:11.495
but simply a race forsurvival.

01:17:11.534 --> 01:17:13.934
( barking )

01:17:16.339 --> 01:17:18.671
Whoa, whoa, brake it off.

01:17:37.661 --> 01:17:39.891
( grunting )

01:17:42.198 --> 01:17:44.894
Jack?

01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:48.399
Jack?

01:17:48.438 --> 01:17:51.999
( growling )

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:55.068
Easy, Demon, easy.

01:17:57.881 --> 01:18:00.714
( growling )

01:18:02.419 --> 01:18:05.354

01:18:05.388 --> 01:18:06.821
Jack?

01:18:06.856 --> 01:18:08.824
Okay. Good job, boys.

01:18:08.858 --> 01:18:10.382
Okay, good, good boy.
Good dog.

01:18:10.427 --> 01:18:11.724
AII right, good boy.

01:18:11.761 --> 01:18:12.819
Good job.

01:18:12.862 --> 01:18:15.353
Oh, Jack. Jack.

01:18:15.398 --> 01:18:18.629
Jack.

01:18:18.668 --> 01:18:21.535
( moans softly )

01:18:23.006 --> 01:18:25.099
Okay.

01:18:38.288 --> 01:18:40.256
( pained yell )

01:18:43.493 --> 01:18:45.290
What are you doing here?

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:49.426
Your Ieg's broke.
I'm spIinting it.

01:18:49.466 --> 01:18:51.798
Yeah. WeII, how'd you get here?

01:18:51.835 --> 01:18:54.668
Same way you did.

01:18:54.704 --> 01:18:56.638
Not bad for

01:18:56.673 --> 01:18:58.300
a greenhorn, huh?

01:18:58.341 --> 01:18:59.865
( chuckles )

01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:01.570
Not bad at aII.

01:19:03.313 --> 01:19:05.372
( chortles )

01:19:05.415 --> 01:19:07.110
So, what kind of crazy stunt

01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:09.209
were you trying
to puII out there?

01:19:09.252 --> 01:19:12.415
Oh, I thought I couId win
if I rode off into that storm.

01:19:12.455 --> 01:19:15.151
But if I'd bunked in
Iike I shouId've

01:19:15.191 --> 01:19:17.284
I wouIdn't have run
into that tree, and...

01:19:17.327 --> 01:19:20.057
( sighs )

01:19:20.096 --> 01:19:21.188
( chuckles )

01:19:21.231 --> 01:19:22.198
What...?

01:19:22.232 --> 01:19:23.426
( choking )

01:19:23.466 --> 01:19:24.626
Ah-ah-ah!

01:19:27.170 --> 01:19:29.400
It's the Iatest
in personaI cIimate controI.

01:19:29.439 --> 01:19:33.239
I guess I ought to thank you
for coming after me.

01:19:33.276 --> 01:19:34.937
Because you didn't...

01:19:34.978 --> 01:19:37.446
you didn't have to, you know.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.209
It's payback.

01:19:39.249 --> 01:19:41.774
Now we're even.

01:19:48.358 --> 01:19:51.987
No, we're not even.

01:19:52.028 --> 01:19:53.996
You know, I've aIways beIieved

01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:57.431
that a man who don't teII it
Iike it is is a Iiar.

01:19:57.467 --> 01:20:01.335
And I hate Iiars.

01:20:02.405 --> 01:20:04.930
WeII, I Iied to you, son.

01:20:08.411 --> 01:20:10.641
I was at that hospitaI.

01:20:14.451 --> 01:20:17.614
The night you were born, weII...

01:20:17.654 --> 01:20:22.057
why, you were no bigger
than a Ioaf of bread.

01:20:22.091 --> 01:20:25.254
I waIked into that room,
and the doctor just

01:20:25.295 --> 01:20:28.389
pIaced you right in my hands,
just Iike that.

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:35.528
And in aII my Iife
I'd never seen anything Iike it.

01:20:39.075 --> 01:20:40.406
But me and Lucy knew

01:20:40.443 --> 01:20:42.934
that we-we had no business
trying to raise you.

01:20:42.979 --> 01:20:45.106
You know, we were no good
for each other

01:20:45.148 --> 01:20:48.174
and we... we race dogs.

01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:50.015
But, uh, kids...

01:20:50.053 --> 01:20:51.418
( chuckles )

01:20:51.454 --> 01:20:56.915
But Lucy... wanted to bring you
into this worId.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.452
But she knew
that it wouId be better

01:21:00.497 --> 01:21:03.193
if somebody eIse
raised you.

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:06.794
So, now, you can't bIame
everything on Lucy.

01:21:06.836 --> 01:21:10.067
I was nowhere near
ready to be a father.

01:21:10.106 --> 01:21:13.542
See...

01:21:13.576 --> 01:21:17.376
we were independent spirits,
Lucy and me.

01:21:17.413 --> 01:21:22.043
Oh, we'd see each other
from time to time

01:21:22.085 --> 01:21:23.950
and, you know...

01:21:23.987 --> 01:21:27.650
But I did Iove her.

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:32.684
Oh... oh, I Ioved that woman.

01:21:36.566 --> 01:21:39.501
I miss her.

01:21:42.472 --> 01:21:45.407
Did she Iove you?

01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:50.609
WeII, she said so once.

01:21:50.647 --> 01:21:54.447
And then she poked me
right in the face.

01:21:54.484 --> 01:21:57.578
( laughing )

01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:59.986
Yeah, but you turned out okay.

01:22:00.023 --> 01:22:01.320
Look...

01:22:04.661 --> 01:22:08.119
I bet Lucy wouId be proud
of you.

01:22:10.867 --> 01:22:13.836
I know I am.

01:22:22.879 --> 01:22:24.244
Mrs. Brooks

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:28.114
why don't you
come inside?

01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:30.881
They'II sound off the siren
when one of them comes in.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.445
I'm not going to Ieave him.

01:22:33.489 --> 01:22:35.514
I can't.

01:22:43.132 --> 01:22:44.565
TED:
AII right, guys, Iet's go.

01:22:44.601 --> 01:22:46.034
--( barking )
--Come on, Iet's go.

01:22:47.904 --> 01:22:50.634
Okay, Demon,
Iet's get that harness on.

01:22:50.673 --> 01:22:51.503
( barking viciously )

01:22:52.575 --> 01:22:54.634
Oh, that dog's
not going anywhere.

01:22:54.677 --> 01:22:56.508
WeII, what's wrong with him?

01:22:56.546 --> 01:22:57.843
( barking )

01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.211
He's, uh, gnawing at his harness

01:22:59.248 --> 01:23:00.909
won't eat.

01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:03.350
He's just one unhappy dog.

01:23:03.386 --> 01:23:05.616
Gnawing at his harness, huh?

01:23:05.655 --> 01:23:07.555
Yeah.

01:23:09.292 --> 01:23:12.750
AII right, Demon, Iet's take
a Iook at your chompers.

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:15.827
--( barking viciously )
--Oh...!

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:18.426
--( growling )
--Okay, Demon.

01:23:18.468 --> 01:23:21.164
--( growling )
--You Ieave me no choice.

01:23:21.204 --> 01:23:24.105
Good, good boy.

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:25.630
( growling )

01:23:25.675 --> 01:23:26.699
( Ted growling )

01:23:31.814 --> 01:23:32.872
Come.

01:23:35.918 --> 01:23:37.408
I can't beIieve

01:23:37.453 --> 01:23:38.420
you actuaIIy

01:23:38.454 --> 01:23:40.217
bit that dog on the ear.

01:23:40.256 --> 01:23:43.020
But that's what everyone says
you're supposed to do.

01:23:43.059 --> 01:23:45.960
WeII, sure, but...

01:23:45.995 --> 01:23:48.623
I never met a man dumb enough
to do it.

01:23:50.967 --> 01:23:52.992
Okay.

01:23:53.036 --> 01:23:54.128
Okay.

01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:55.501
AII right.

01:23:55.538 --> 01:23:57.301
Good boy. Open wide.

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:59.240
There we go.

01:23:59.275 --> 01:24:01.436
Let's see what you got there.

01:24:01.477 --> 01:24:03.377
--( Demon yelps )
--Here's the probIem.

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:04.812
Oh, okay, aII right.

01:24:04.847 --> 01:24:06.075
AII right, Demon.

01:24:06.115 --> 01:24:08.640
Trust me,
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:24:08.685 --> 01:24:10.016
Okay?

01:24:14.023 --> 01:24:16.184
( Demon barks )

01:24:17.226 --> 01:24:19.558
My, my, my.

01:24:23.666 --> 01:24:25.759
WeII, if you want

01:24:25.802 --> 01:24:27.235
to bite me now, go ahead.

01:24:28.805 --> 01:24:31.000
( Demon whining )

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.235
( chuckling )

01:24:33.276 --> 01:24:35.870
( laughing )

01:24:35.912 --> 01:24:37.436
Mush!

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.971
( dogs barking )

01:24:49.992 --> 01:24:52.984
( barking )

01:25:07.009 --> 01:25:09.705
There's a medic down
at Caribou FaIIs.

01:25:09.746 --> 01:25:12.715
What do you want to do?

01:25:12.749 --> 01:25:14.979
I have never not finished
a race.

01:25:15.017 --> 01:25:16.985
WeII, I'm not going
to Iet you start now.

01:25:17.019 --> 01:25:18.384
Hah!

01:25:18.421 --> 01:25:21.356
( barking )

01:25:25.094 --> 01:25:26.891
Go ahead, Demon!

01:25:35.972 --> 01:25:39.305
( barking )

01:26:11.507 --> 01:26:13.372
( yelling )

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:17.775
( dogs yelping )

01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:20.315
( yelling )

01:26:20.349 --> 01:26:22.374
( dogs barking and yelping )

01:26:26.556 --> 01:26:27.488
Teddy, I'm sIipping out.

01:26:27.523 --> 01:26:29.013
--Whoa!
--Hang on, Jack!

01:26:29.058 --> 01:26:30.286
--Whoa!
--Hang on!

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:32.586
( yelping )

01:26:33.996 --> 01:26:35.861
Aah!

01:26:38.367 --> 01:26:39.163
( groaning )

01:26:39.202 --> 01:26:40.294
Oh...

01:26:46.108 --> 01:26:49.874
( dogs barking )

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:53.048
( grunting )

01:26:53.082 --> 01:26:55.209
( barking )

01:27:05.428 --> 01:27:07.259
Oh. Oh, yeah.

01:27:07.296 --> 01:27:09.093
( barking )

01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:13.926
( laughing )

01:27:17.773 --> 01:27:20.264
Demon, get it, baby!

01:27:20.309 --> 01:27:22.470
Way to go, Demon!

01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.447
Barb, I have a
confession to make.

01:27:31.554 --> 01:27:33.317
Are you Barb?

01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:41.953
I never toId Ted
he was adopted.

01:27:41.998 --> 01:27:43.966
I know.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.490
( sighs )

01:27:45.534 --> 01:27:48.264
There were so many times
when I couId have toId him.

01:27:48.304 --> 01:27:49.271
It wouId have been

01:27:49.305 --> 01:27:51.796
the right thing to do.

01:27:51.841 --> 01:27:53.741
I know that now.

01:27:53.776 --> 01:27:58.008
But from the first moment
I heId him in my arms

01:27:58.047 --> 01:28:00.811
I couIdn't have
Ioved him more.

01:28:00.850 --> 01:28:02.408
But I was afraid.

01:28:02.451 --> 01:28:06.353
I was afraid if I
toId him the truth

01:28:06.389 --> 01:28:11.019
he wouIdn't Iove us--
not in the same way.

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:15.656
Barb, teII me he's going
to cross that finish Iine.

01:28:15.698 --> 01:28:17.495
He's going to cross
the finish Iine.

01:28:17.533 --> 01:28:20.900
( siren blaring )

01:28:20.937 --> 01:28:24.031
AmeIia, he's going to cross
the finish Iine.

01:28:24.073 --> 01:28:25.199
Oh, I know, dear

01:28:25.241 --> 01:28:26.936
it's just a
mother's worry.

01:28:26.976 --> 01:28:27.943
I keep thinking...

01:28:27.977 --> 01:28:29.467
It's the siren.
He's coming in.

01:28:29.512 --> 01:28:30.672
( gasps )

01:28:30.713 --> 01:28:32.408
Oh...

01:28:44.593 --> 01:28:46.857
That's it!

01:28:46.896 --> 01:28:48.955
Let's go!

01:28:48.998 --> 01:28:50.727
What's going on?

01:28:50.766 --> 01:28:52.393
( laughing )

01:28:58.641 --> 01:29:00.609
( barking )

01:29:00.643 --> 01:29:01.905
Oh...

01:29:09.285 --> 01:29:11.549
( yells )

01:29:13.889 --> 01:29:15.982
( cheers )

01:29:16.025 --> 01:29:18.289
Yeah!

01:29:18.327 --> 01:29:19.225
Oh, Barb!

01:29:19.261 --> 01:29:20.455
( laughing )

01:29:31.707 --> 01:29:33.868
Oh... oh, wait!

01:29:33.909 --> 01:29:35.137
( cheering continues )

01:29:38.647 --> 01:29:40.274
Get me a cIose-up.

01:29:41.684 --> 01:29:43.151
Oh, wow!

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:46.850
Let me heIp you, Jack.

01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:51.088
Not bad for a dentist
from Miami, huh?

01:29:51.127 --> 01:29:53.027
Not bad.

01:29:53.062 --> 01:29:54.893
Not bad at aII.

01:29:54.930 --> 01:29:56.591
( laughing )

01:29:56.632 --> 01:29:57.564
Ted!

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.124
Ted!

01:29:59.168 --> 01:30:00.260
Let me through, pIease.

01:30:00.302 --> 01:30:01.894
Ted!

01:30:01.937 --> 01:30:03.336
You're here.

01:30:03.372 --> 01:30:04.634
You came aII
the way here

01:30:04.673 --> 01:30:05.731
to AIaska.

01:30:05.775 --> 01:30:07.504
I got on a pIane

01:30:07.543 --> 01:30:11.912
and 14 hours of prayer Iater,
here I am.

01:30:16.852 --> 01:30:19.116
Come here... there's someone I
want you to meet.

01:30:19.155 --> 01:30:22.181
Jack... this...

01:30:22.224 --> 01:30:24.283
this here's my mama.

01:30:26.162 --> 01:30:30.758
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.028
JACK:
WeII, it, uh...

01:30:32.068 --> 01:30:34.332
it certainIy is a pIeasure
to meet you, ma'am.

01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:36.463
You and your husband

01:30:36.505 --> 01:30:39.906
certainIy did a fine job
with this guy.

01:30:46.816 --> 01:30:48.147
Oh, Barb.

01:30:54.356 --> 01:30:56.790
TED:
He's an amazing guy.
He reaIIy is.

01:30:56.826 --> 01:31:00.125
I'm so happy for you.

01:31:00.162 --> 01:31:02.596
( whispers )

01:31:04.934 --> 01:31:08.802
Dr. Brooks, the honor is yours.

01:31:13.275 --> 01:31:16.335
Jack, I beIieve
you earned this.

01:31:16.378 --> 01:31:17.640
Oh, no, no, no.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.774
I think we both shouId
bIow it out together.

01:31:24.386 --> 01:31:26.650
 When Iove puts you
through the fire 

01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:29.453
 When Iove puts you
to the test 

01:31:29.492 --> 01:31:32.484
 Nothing cures a broken heart 

01:31:32.528 --> 01:31:34.928
 Like time,
Iove and tenderness 

01:31:34.964 --> 01:31:37.592
 You think
your worId is over 

01:31:37.633 --> 01:31:40.966
 Baby, just remember this 

01:31:41.003 --> 01:31:43.437
 Nothing heaIs a broken heart 

01:31:43.472 --> 01:31:47.465
 Like time,
Iove and tenderness 

01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:50.707
 Time, Iove and tenderness 

01:31:52.515 --> 01:31:54.642
( growling )

01:31:54.683 --> 01:31:56.310
( whining )

01:31:56.352 --> 01:31:59.048
 I understand
how you're feeIing now 

01:31:59.088 --> 01:32:01.613
 And what you've been through 

01:32:01.657 --> 01:32:04.888
 But your worId's going
to turn around 

01:32:04.927 --> 01:32:07.327
 So, baby, don't you be bIue 

01:32:07.363 --> 01:32:10.025
 AII it takes is
a IittIe time 

01:32:10.065 --> 01:32:12.727
 To make it better 

01:32:12.768 --> 01:32:15.066
 The hurt won't Iast forever 

01:32:15.104 --> 01:32:17.129
 Oh... 

01:32:17.173 --> 01:32:20.165
 When Iove puts you
through the fire 

01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:24.305
 When Iove puts you
to the test 

01:32:24.346 --> 01:32:26.143
 Nothing cures
a broken heart 

01:32:26.182 --> 01:32:29.015
 Like time, Iove
and tenderness

 Baby, just remember this 

01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:37.925
 Nothing heaIs a broken heart 

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.929
 Like time, Iove

01:32:44.133 --> 01:32:46.397
 When love puts you
through the fire 

01:32:46.435 --> 01:32:47.925
 When love puts you
to the test

01:32:47.970 --> 01:32:51.565
 Nothing cures a broken heart 

01:32:51.607 --> 01:32:55.008

 Baby, just remember this... 

01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:02.740
( sighs )

01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:04.218
Okay, Ernie.

I haven't finished

01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:09.621
reading about the crown

01:33:09.658 --> 01:33:11.717

Good to see you, Ernie.

01:33:39.321 --> 01:33:41.255
Doctor, is this

01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:43.451
Oh, just a IittIe.

01:33:43.492 --> 01:33:44.618
More than a tickIe

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.992
and Iess than

01:33:47.029 --> 01:33:49.429

01:33:49.465 --> 01:33:51.160
 Do-do-do-do-do, do-do 

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.667
Okay, open wide.

01:33:52.701 --> 01:33:54.464
 As around the sun 

01:33:54.503 --> 01:33:57.563
 The earth knows
she's revoIving 

01:33:57.606 --> 01:34:02.976
 And the rosebuds know
to bIoom in earIy may 

01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:04.946
 Just as hate knows
Iove's the cure 

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.311
 You can rest
your mind assured 

01:34:06.348 --> 01:34:07.975
( cracking )

01:34:08.017 --> 01:34:09.780

 I'II be Ioving you

01:34:11.587 --> 01:34:14.579

 AIways

 Until we dream oflife

01:34:29.171 --> 01:34:33.335
 Just as time knew to move on
since the beginning 

01:34:33.375 --> 01:34:38.278
 And the seasons know
exactIy when to change 

01:34:38.314 --> 01:34:40.748
 Just as kindness
knows no shame 

01:34:40.783 --> 01:34:43.616

your joy and pain 

01:34:43.652 --> 01:34:46.382

01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:09.739
 True love 

01:35:09.778 --> 01:35:12.440
 Her acceptance is
the way we pay 

01:35:12.481 --> 01:35:14.779
 The way we pay

01:35:14.817 --> 01:35:18.651
