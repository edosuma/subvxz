couldn't sign off

07:52.038 --> 07:53.606

board for his son's death,

09:20.760 --> 09:22.261

with Annie.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.197
Go. And keep me updated.

09:26.165 --> 09:28.334
Okay. How long ago was that?

09:30.002 --> 09:32.271
All right, I'll-I'll check
back in with you later.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.040
Thanks for keeping me
in the loop.

09:34.106 --> 09:36.208
Thank you.
You okay?

09:37.276 --> 09:38.744
That was the, uh,

09:38.811 --> 09:41.614
ICU nurse
from St. Augustine's.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.650
Chaplain Adams is
out of surgery, but, uh...

09:45.751 --> 09:47.753
...he's still
in critical condition.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.288
I'm sorry.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.290
How did you know him?

09:51.357 --> 09:54.327
We got kind of close after
my liver donation surgery.

09:54.393 --> 09:56.228
I didn't think
you were religious.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.797
(exhales)

09:57.863 --> 09:59.598
When I was laid up,

09:59.665 --> 10:03.235
that man spent hours
by my bedside.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.372
I think he knew

10:06.439 --> 10:09.608
I was feeling
lonely and scared.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.712
We'd just talk about
all kinds of things--

10:12.778 --> 10:16.816
family, baseball,
the best dive bars.

10:16.882 --> 10:19.885
For a priest, he'd kind of been
around the block, you know?

10:21.887 --> 10:24.290
Religious or not, I think
right now you got to believe

10:24.357 --> 10:26.292
Chaplain Adams
will pull through.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.228
Have a little faith?

10:31.063 --> 10:33.132
You sound like him right now.

10:35.034 --> 10:36.702
I'll take that
as a compliment.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.172
(knock on door)

10:40.239 --> 10:42.074
You wanted to see me, Commander?
Yeah,

10:42.141 --> 10:43.943
I just got off the phone
with Detective Rios.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.778
His guys went over every inch
of that stash house

10:45.845 --> 10:47.113
you hit this morning.

10:47.179 --> 10:49.015
They didn't find anything
to link it to Saint.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.683
Yeah, well,
it's just a matter of time.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.051
We're putting
a financial hurt on him,

10:52.118 --> 10:53.386
and he's got to be
feeling the pressure.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.121
Sooner or later,
every ship springs a leak.

10:55.187 --> 10:57.289
Well, I don't disagree
with that, but then, uh,

10:57.356 --> 10:59.025
how do you explain this?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.231
Saint's investing
in Raymont Harris?

11:05.297 --> 11:07.366
Well, you obviously
haven't heard.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.136
I kept in touch with him after
he got shot by Buck, but...

11:10.202 --> 11:11.771
It's only been a few months,

11:11.837 --> 11:14.040
but the last I checked,
he was studying at UCLA.

11:14.106 --> 11:17.143
An aspiring businessman now--
well, so it seems.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.677
Saint doesn't invest in anything

11:18.744 --> 11:19.779
unless there's an angle
in it for him.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.714
In a mobile grocery business?

11:21.781 --> 11:23.115
Well, maybe drug distribution,

11:23.182 --> 11:24.283
or another way to launder money,
I don't know.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.951
The name Raymont Harris,

11:26.018 --> 11:28.120
it still stirs up bad feelings
about the LAPD.

11:28.187 --> 11:32.091
Now, if you do anything
to nix this kid's business,

11:32.158 --> 11:35.361
I worry it'll only bring
more blowback on the department.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.463
Raymont's walking
into a minefield,

11:37.530 --> 11:39.031
and he doesn't even know it.
Look.

11:39.098 --> 11:42.268
Do us all a favor,
tread lightly.

11:44.403 --> 11:47.173
I am so, so sorry.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.008
I, uh...

11:49.075 --> 11:51.110
My car charger stopped working,
and then my phone died,

11:51.177 --> 11:53.279
and I forgot Lila
had a half day. I...

11:53.345 --> 11:55.214
(sighs)

11:55.281 --> 11:57.249
Thank you so much
for picking her up.

11:57.316 --> 11:58.918
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's, uh...

11:58.984 --> 12:00.186
She's upstairs
doing her homework. She's good.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.220
Okay.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.755
What's all that?

12:02.822 --> 12:05.257
Uh... photocopies.
You remember those?

12:05.324 --> 12:08.427
I went down to the Superior
Court Archives this morning,

12:08.494 --> 12:10.496
and I think I found something
that might help

12:10.563 --> 12:12.064
prove Ortiz's innocence.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.933
So, the prosecution's case

12:13.999 --> 12:16.202
hinges on their star witness,
Jorge Espinoza.

12:16.268 --> 12:17.336
But here's the thing,

12:17.403 --> 12:19.038
the statement
the prosecution used

12:19.105 --> 12:20.506
to secure the plea deal,
it doesn't line up

12:20.573 --> 12:22.208
with what Espinoza
told the detectives

12:22.274 --> 12:23.509
when they first
interviewed him.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.811
But I think that
he changed his story

12:25.878 --> 12:27.413
to align with
the prosecution's theory.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.981
So you pair that with

12:29.048 --> 12:31.283
Kim Wagner's
corroborating Ortiz's alibi,

12:31.350 --> 12:33.819
and the case against Ortiz
starts to look very suspect.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.988
I mean, here,
take a look for yourself.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.359
You know, Annie, I can
appreciate that you're taking

12:40.426 --> 12:42.394
all this interest
in the Ortiz case,

12:42.461 --> 12:45.297
but, um, I thought we were
gonna do this together.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.801
Yeah, me, too, but you've-you've
been busy at work.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.803
And to that point,
I had to leave that job

12:50.870 --> 12:52.204
in the middle
of an active SWAT case

12:52.271 --> 12:53.506
to go pick Lila up.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.074
And I apologized.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.376
It was an atypical school day.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.927
to meet demand,
so organ traffickers

19:21.994 --> 19:25.764
go out and recruit donors
from all over the globe.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.400
Okay, so Hill was uh, shopping
the black market for a kidney.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.168
Where does
OJN Insurance fit in?

19:30.235 --> 19:31.670
Organ traffickers
are very smart.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.640
They fabricate cover stories

19:34.706 --> 19:37.442
to classify organs
as goodwill donations

19:37.509 --> 19:39.678
so the transplants
can take place

19:39.745 --> 19:42.180
in real hospitals
with legitimate doctors.

19:42.247 --> 19:46.184
But in this case, we caught wind
that the donation wasn't legit,

19:46.251 --> 19:48.754
so we refused
to cover the procedure.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.790
Without insurance,
the surgery is...

19:51.857 --> 19:53.458
Insanely expensive.
But you think

19:53.525 --> 19:55.694
Hill already had
a black market organ lined up?

19:55.761 --> 19:57.462
It certainly seemed like it.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.298
We need to take a closer look
at Hill's financials.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.333
Thanks for your help.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.903
Deac, hold up a sec.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.573
Come here.

20:09.408 --> 20:10.943
You were pretty
on edge earlier.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.945
Everything okay
with the kids at home?

20:13.011 --> 20:14.713
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it was just a miscommunication

20:14.780 --> 20:16.281
with Annie and me.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.383
Well, miscommunications
happen in marriages.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.620
Yeah.
You and Annie okay?

20:21.687 --> 20:23.689
Yeah, yeah.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.892
All right. (clears throat)
Full disclosure.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.494
We're, uh...
we're working this old RHD case

20:29.561 --> 20:31.296
where I was arresting officer.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.332
The suspect--
he took a plea deal.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.534
Well, now he claims he's
innocent. Annie's convinced that

20:35.601 --> 20:37.603
he's telling the truth,
and she's trying to...

20:37.669 --> 20:39.705
move heaven and earth
to prove it.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.573
Think she's on to something?
I don't know, but I do know

20:41.640 --> 20:44.309
that I haven't seen her
this excited about something--

20:44.376 --> 20:46.545
anything-- in a long time.

20:46.612 --> 20:49.748
Happy wife, happy life, no?
Yeah. Thing is,

20:49.815 --> 20:52.584
our entire marriage,
I've been the breadwinner.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.821
And Annie's always had my back
when it came to the home front.

20:55.887 --> 20:59.358
And I guess I-I just want
to reciprocate that support.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.759
You know?
Mm-hmm.

21:00.826 --> 21:03.729
I just... with everything
I have going on,

21:03.795 --> 21:05.530
I don't know how
to work that out.

21:05.597 --> 21:10.736
Look, take it from someone
who realized it too late.

21:10.802 --> 21:15.040
Enjoy your time with your wife
and kids, Deac, while you can.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.476
It's over before you know it.

21:17.542 --> 21:18.810
(phone ringing)

21:18.877 --> 21:20.512
(sighs)

21:26.652 --> 21:28.487
What do you got, Street?

21:28.553 --> 21:30.622
I've been going through
Fred Hill's financial records.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.557
Not much out of the
ordinary except...

21:32.624 --> 21:35.494
A lump sum payment
of 75 grand?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.062
Going rate for
a black market kidney.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.830
Thought he was
struggling financially.
He cashed out

21:38.897 --> 21:41.400
his 401k, then borrowed
the rest against his house.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.702
Looks like the payment went
to an Archangel Medical Supply?

21:43.769 --> 21:45.704
It's a medical device sales
company in the Valley.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.539
But Archangel only
has one employee,

21:47.606 --> 21:48.874
so it's probably a front.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.475
Who's the perennial
Employee of the Month?

21:50.542 --> 21:52.511
Arjun Kahn.

21:52.577 --> 21:54.579
Misdemeanors for bribery
and embezzlement.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.014
He's also a registered
Overseas Citizen of India.

21:56.081 --> 21:58.583
Traveled there six times
this last year.

21:58.650 --> 21:59.985
To recruit organ donors.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.621
Over 2,000 Indians
sell a kidney every year, so...

22:02.688 --> 22:04.823
Find his ass.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.725
Would any of your business
partners be interested

22:06.792 --> 22:08.560
in investing in the kid's
business venture?
(door opens)

22:08.627 --> 22:10.696
It shows a lot of promise. I...

22:13.565 --> 22:17.402
Okay. I understand, Ms. Baker.

22:17.469 --> 22:18.970
Thank you for your time.

22:19.037 --> 22:21.073
And I'll tell Nichelle
that you said hi.

22:21.139 --> 22:23.475
Okay.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.510
(sighs)
Hey, is everything okay, boss?

22:25.577 --> 22:27.913
I am trying to help
Raymont Harris get out of a jam.

22:27.979 --> 22:30.115
Is he in trouble?
He will be soon enough.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.784
Saint is investing
in his first business.
Mm?

22:32.851 --> 22:34.786
And I am trying like hell
to find him a different backer

22:34.853 --> 22:36.855
before he gets in too deep,
but I am running low

22:36.922 --> 22:38.623
on time and options.
Well, how much does he need?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.625
I got a couple grand
I can kick in.
Luca,

22:40.692 --> 22:43.395
kid needs a hundred.
(scoffs)

22:43.462 --> 22:45.030
I just tried asking
Othella Baker to invest,

22:45.097 --> 22:46.898
but she doesn't want
to step on Saint's turf.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.834
So this Saint dude's
got her fooled, too.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.869
Her and everyone else.

22:50.936 --> 22:53.939
That dude has to have
a weak spot somewhere.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.942
Talk to me, Street.

22:57.008 --> 22:59.111
Hey, patrol didn't find any sign
of Arjun Kahn at his home

22:59.177 --> 23:02.013
or the Archangel office,
but they did uncover this.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.750
Hill inside the
Archangel offices.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.656
Happened about an hour before
Hill shot up St. Augustine's.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.658
Lucky for Kahn, he was gone
when Hill came looking.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.827
Any intel on Kahn's
current whereabouts?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.796
Yeah, I got something
that'll help with that.

23:17.863 --> 23:19.731
Found a house
in San Fernando registered

23:19.798 --> 23:22.567
to Archangel Medical Supply,
rented two weeks ago.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.669
Go see who's home.

23:35.647 --> 23:37.916
Street, take the four side.

23:42.187 --> 23:43.855
26-David. We got a rabbit.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.891
Suspect headed
for the three side.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.592
(groans)

23:47.659 --> 23:49.961
That's about as far as you go.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.533
KAHN:
I don't know where Hill is,

23:54.599 --> 23:55.767
he doesn't know where I am,

23:55.834 --> 23:57.469
and I would like
to keep it that way.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.638
It has nothing to do
with you trafficking organs?

23:59.704 --> 24:01.473
Not sure
what you're talking about.

24:01.540 --> 24:02.908
Really?

24:02.974 --> 24:04.743
We know about
the frequent trips to India

24:04.810 --> 24:06.144
and the five-figure payments

24:06.211 --> 24:07.946
that show up
in your company's bank accounts.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.081
Medical device sales.
LUCA:
Oh, that's a pretty broad

24:10.148 --> 24:12.651
definition of "medical device"
if you ask me.

24:12.717 --> 24:15.020
STREET:
Oh, look, I get it.
I mean, if I sold someone

24:15.086 --> 24:17.622
a bad kidney that killed their
son, I'd want to disappear, too.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.491
It wasn't a bad kidney!

24:22.294 --> 24:24.729
I take my work seriously.

24:26.865 --> 24:30.035
What I do gives thousands of
people a second chance at life.

24:30.101 --> 24:32.037
I help save people.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.672
I don't kill them.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.674
By harvesting their organs
for a profit?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.809
I was trying
to help Isaac Hill.

24:39.611 --> 24:43.849
The kidney was a perfect match,
but Isaac's body rejected it.

24:43.915 --> 24:45.851
He died a few days later.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.552
So the surgery did happen?

24:47.619 --> 24:49.621
Isaac did receive a
kidney before he died?

24:49.688 --> 24:51.756
Who performed
the operation?

24:51.823 --> 24:54.025
LUCA:
Fred Hill wants to kill anyone
he thinks is responsible

24:54.092 --> 24:56.094
for his son's death, okay?

24:56.161 --> 24:59.631
If he's after you, he's gonna
go after the surgeon, too.

24:59.698 --> 25:02.033
You say you're in the business
of saving lives.

25:04.569 --> 25:06.705
Dr. Zachary Floyd.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.774
Floyd has to be
Hill's next target.

25:17.215 --> 25:18.850
Talk to me.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.952
Dr. Floyd has got medical
offices in Encino and Burbank,

25:21.019 --> 25:22.721
plus a home in Valley Village.
There's no answer

25:22.787 --> 25:24.222
at any of them so far.

25:24.289 --> 25:26.024
I got unis rolling to each
location as we speak.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.959
Yeah, well, let's hope Hill
didn't already get to Floyd.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.562
Hill just posted a video
to his Facebook account.

25:30.629 --> 25:33.965
Dr. Zach Floyd said
he'd save Isaac.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.067
He said the garbage kidney

25:36.134 --> 25:38.703
he sewed into my kid
would keep him alive.

25:38.770 --> 25:40.872
But Floyd lied.

25:40.939 --> 25:42.974
(crying):
And his lie killed my son.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.044
It's time for him to pay.

25:46.111 --> 25:48.046
So, to all the cops
and reporters listening,

25:48.113 --> 25:49.981
you better get to Encino.

25:50.048 --> 25:54.619
And don't be late,
or you'll miss the fireworks.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.688
When was this posted?
Eight minutes ago.

25:56.755 --> 25:58.723
He also tagged the LAPD
and two local news stations.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.058
He's taunting us.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.727
Get to Floyd's
office in Encino.

26:02.794 --> 26:05.163
(phone ringing)

26:05.230 --> 26:08.166
Shelby, is my 4:00 here yet?

26:08.233 --> 26:10.769
(phone continues ringing)

26:10.835 --> 26:12.771
Shelby?

26:12.837 --> 26:14.873
(phone continues ringing)

26:22.013 --> 26:25.183
(voice breaking):
Dr. Floyd.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.152
Let's take a walk.

26:31.856 --> 26:33.825
(engine revving)

26:33.892 --> 26:35.860
Okay, two minutes out!

26:35.927 --> 26:37.329
Anything more from Hill
on his socials?

26:37.395 --> 26:39.831
All quiet since the last video.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.933
Something feels off
about this.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.835
Seems like he's trying
to send a message.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.704
Question is, what message?
STREET:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.605
I think we're about to find out.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.741
REPORTER (on TV): ...in Encino,
where a dangerous situation

26:49.808 --> 26:51.309
appears to be unfolding.
STREET: This is live.

26:51.376 --> 26:54.012
HILL:
I'm glad you could join us!

26:54.079 --> 26:55.747
Say hi to the people, Doc.

26:55.814 --> 26:58.116
Luca, step on it.
Got it.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.688
Oh, now everybody
want to listen?

27:05.223 --> 27:07.759
Where were you all
when Isaac needed help?

27:07.826 --> 27:09.928
Huh?!

27:09.995 --> 27:12.230
Where were you all?!

27:22.040 --> 27:24.275
(doors open)

27:24.342 --> 27:26.778
LAPD! Get the media
out of here!

27:26.845 --> 27:28.213
Move! Move back!
CHRIS:
Move! Move! Move! Move!

27:28.279 --> 27:30.682
HONDO:
Now! Move!
Get back, everyone!

27:32.817 --> 27:37.255
Chris, get to the rooftop.
Line up a shot. Go!

27:37.322 --> 27:39.657
Mr. Hill, put the gun down.

27:39.724 --> 27:41.993
I can't do that.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.995
Nobody needs
to get hurt here today, Fred.

27:45.797 --> 27:47.966
Let's just take a breath
and talk this through.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.868
Why don't you
just shoot me?!

27:49.934 --> 27:52.137
That's what y'all guys like
to do anyway, right?

27:53.938 --> 27:55.240
HONDO:
Your son was sick, Fred.

27:55.306 --> 27:57.008
There was nothing
Dr. Floyd

27:57.075 --> 27:58.309
or anyone else could've done.

27:58.376 --> 28:00.378
Stop lying!

28:00.445 --> 28:02.414
Nobody wanted
to help Isaac.

28:02.480 --> 28:06.117
They chose to not
give him a kidney.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.219
They chose to kill him!

28:08.286 --> 28:10.321
Floyd didn't care
about killing my son.

28:10.388 --> 28:12.223
Why should I care
if I kill him?

28:12.290 --> 28:14.793
Take it easy, Fred.
Take it easy.

28:16.061 --> 28:17.829
24-David. I'm set.

28:17.896 --> 28:20.131
Listen to me, man.
This is your last chance.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.000
Put that gun down!

28:22.067 --> 28:23.868
Why don't you
pull the trigger?

28:23.935 --> 28:25.236
In fact, I dare you.

28:25.303 --> 28:28.139
Don't do it, please!
Shut up! Shut up!

28:28.206 --> 28:29.874
I got a clean shot, Hondo.

28:29.941 --> 28:31.142
What are you
waiting for, huh?

28:31.209 --> 28:32.911
If you want to
shoot me, shoot me!

28:32.977 --> 28:34.846
Do it!

28:36.948 --> 28:38.283
Shoot me!

28:38.349 --> 28:40.351
Hold your fire!
I repeat, hold your fire!

28:40.418 --> 28:41.786
Do not shoot!

28:41.853 --> 28:43.154
Hondo, what are you doing?

28:43.221 --> 28:44.489
HONDO:
There's a wire
running from Hill's

28:44.556 --> 28:46.224
shotgun trigger finger
to Floyd.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.059
It's wrapped around Floyd's
neck, under his shirt collar.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.795
I see it.
Dead man's switch.

28:50.862 --> 28:53.398
If we shoot Hill, that shotgun
goes off, and Floyd dies, too.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.401
You're not gonna
pull the trigger?

28:56.468 --> 28:59.270
Then we'll be on our way.

28:59.337 --> 29:02.307
Move. Move. Move!

29:03.308 --> 29:05.310
All 20-Squad, back off.

29:05.376 --> 29:08.113
Everyone, back away.
Let him pass.

29:17.055 --> 29:19.257
HONDO:
Deacon.
DEACON: Got it.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.929
Let him pass.
Let him pass!

29:26.331 --> 29:28.900
All right, for your own safety,
back up.

29:28.967 --> 29:31.402
Officers,
get the press out of here now!

29:31.469 --> 29:33.838
(camera shutters clicking)

29:38.076 --> 29:40.478
Hey, folks, do me a favor.
Clear this area, okay?

29:40.545 --> 29:43.781
All right, the rest of 20-Squad
on me. Back to the Gurkha.

29:43.848 --> 29:45.950
Deacon, I need you to engage
with Hill, keep him moving.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.952
DEACON:
Roger that.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.555
CHRIS: 24-David. 500 yards
until Hill is out of my range.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.423
Stay on him as long
as you can, Chris.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.425
If this goes sideways,
you take it.
CHRIS: Roger.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.294
All right, listen up.
Pincer maneuver's our best shot.

29:56.361 --> 29:57.996
That's gonna be tough
out in the open.

29:58.062 --> 29:59.797
If we can lure Hill
into a trap zone,

29:59.864 --> 30:01.199
we can wrestle that gun away.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.467
There's only a couple
inches of clearance

30:02.534 --> 30:04.002
between that gun and Floyd.

30:04.068 --> 30:05.803
If it goes off
as we try to grab it...

30:05.870 --> 30:08.373
I know. That's why we got to
execute this thing perfectly.

30:08.439 --> 30:11.142
Let's move.
20-David to Command.

30:11.209 --> 30:13.244
What do you need, Hondo?

30:13.311 --> 30:14.345
Some tactical GPS.

30:14.412 --> 30:16.247
Copy.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.018
Listen to the officers.
Just give us some room!

30:20.084 --> 30:22.854
Step back. Put those cameras
down. Give us some space, okay?

30:22.921 --> 30:24.189
(sirens blaring)
It's all right.

30:24.255 --> 30:25.990
(indistinct radio transmission)

30:26.057 --> 30:27.325
They're here for you.
They're here for me.

30:27.392 --> 30:28.560
They got to be here.
Don't worry about it.

30:28.626 --> 30:30.862
(indistinct chatter)

30:32.597 --> 30:34.432
Where you going, Fred?

30:34.499 --> 30:36.201
HILL:
To see my son.

30:36.267 --> 30:39.604
The world needs to see
where this bastard put Isaac.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.473
You're going
to visit Isaac's grave?

30:42.540 --> 30:44.509
Don't say his name.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.945
You don't get
to say his name!

30:48.580 --> 30:51.082
DEACON: All right.
I'm sorry. I understand.

30:51.149 --> 30:53.251
Isaac's grave.

30:53.318 --> 30:56.020
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.258
Hey, Fred.

31:00.325 --> 31:02.093
My name's David.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.462
I just want to see my son.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.331
I know.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.900
I just want
to see my son.

31:08.967 --> 31:12.203
Okay. All right, let's...
Let's-let's go.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.272
Isaac's buried at Monarch
Cemetery, less than a mile

31:14.339 --> 31:15.640
to the northwest.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.910
So, uh, you're headed
to Monarch, right?

31:18.977 --> 31:21.112
He's buried at Monarch?

31:21.980 --> 31:25.383
Hondo, there's a stretch at
Catalina Avenue that could work.

31:25.450 --> 31:27.485
Two blocks ahead.
Sending it now.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.220
(siren blaring)

31:31.723 --> 31:33.992
DEACON:
No, no. That's all right.
That's all right.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.893
They're leaving.
They're leaving, see?

31:35.960 --> 31:37.929
(siren retreating)
Let's go.

31:43.301 --> 31:45.403
All right, that's
our trap zone right there.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.238
This is 20-David.

31:47.305 --> 31:49.607
I need all available patrol
units to create a barricade

31:49.674 --> 31:51.476
on westbound Catalina at Olive.

31:51.542 --> 31:53.411
Deac, when you get
in that intersection,

31:53.478 --> 31:55.313
have him head north.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.448
CHRIS: If he turns off this
road, I'll lose sight of him.

31:57.515 --> 32:00.084
We got no choice.
It's our best and only option.

32:00.151 --> 32:02.253
Get us there, Luca.
Got it.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.963
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

32:14.432 --> 32:17.402
DEACON:
Hey, it's all right,
Fred. Look at me.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.704
They're here because
that's a school right there.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.706
You don't want kids
to see this, all right?

32:21.773 --> 32:24.008
Let's-let's...
let's keep walking.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.278
Move. Move!

32:51.202 --> 32:53.371
(siren blaring)

32:53.438 --> 32:54.739
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
HILL:
Tell 'em back off!

32:54.806 --> 32:55.973
DEACON:
All right, I will.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.141
Tell 'em! Tell 'em!

32:57.208 --> 32:58.643
Tell 'em!
DEACON: Back off!

32:58.710 --> 32:59.644
That's it. I told 'em.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.312
HONDO:
This is 20-David.

33:01.379 --> 33:02.980
We're in position.

33:03.047 --> 33:05.450
DEACON:
Listen to me, Fred.

33:05.516 --> 33:07.985
I got rid of them.
Why don't you let Dr. Floyd go?

33:08.052 --> 33:10.355
You know what?
I'm getting really sick

33:10.421 --> 33:12.724
of listening to you, man.

33:20.798 --> 33:22.734
We wouldn't want it
to end like this.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.602
Neither would Isaac.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.003
(gunshot)

33:26.070 --> 33:28.206
(groaning)

33:28.272 --> 33:29.240
Go, go, go, go!

33:29.307 --> 33:32.043
(grunting)

33:32.110 --> 33:34.612
Luca! You got it?
Got it.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.048
Got it.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.684
(groaning)
Give me your hands.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.786
(panting)

33:43.454 --> 33:45.423
You all right?
Yeah.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.091
(Hill groaning)

33:47.158 --> 33:48.459
HONDO:
Get up!

33:48.526 --> 33:51.062
(groans)

33:51.129 --> 33:53.698
I'm sorry you lost your family.
I really am.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.767
This is over now.

33:57.468 --> 33:58.636
Come on.

34:00.805 --> 34:04.108
(distant sirens,
helicopters whirring)

34:04.175 --> 34:06.210
(sighs)

34:08.646 --> 34:11.482
(panting):
20-David.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.618
We're code 4.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.190
(sighs)

34:20.191 --> 34:21.659
You all right?

34:24.462 --> 34:25.830
(cell phone beeps, buzzes)

34:30.368 --> 34:32.403
No, no.

34:34.238 --> 34:35.773
(sighs)

34:41.879 --> 34:44.515
Oh, man, you sure? I mean,
these things are always a blast.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.284
I know. I know. I, uh...

34:46.350 --> 34:48.386
I got to take care
of something at home.

34:48.453 --> 34:50.822
And that has to come
before everything,

34:50.888 --> 34:53.424
even SWAT.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.526
All right.
Fair enough.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.128
Knock 'em dead.

34:58.863 --> 35:02.633
All right, let's get this thing
rolling, ladies and gentlemen!

35:02.700 --> 35:05.670
I'm gonna be your host
in the SWAT Academy Talent Show!

35:05.736 --> 35:08.339
(applause and cheering)
STREET:
Boo!

35:08.406 --> 35:10.141
We want Stevens!

35:10.208 --> 35:11.676
Right, thanks, Street.
All right!
Stevens!

35:11.742 --> 35:13.344
Remember, this is
all in good fun.

35:13.411 --> 35:14.712
Right? Yeah.
(laughter)

35:14.779 --> 35:16.280
Up first, we have--

35:16.347 --> 35:17.882
oh, this
should be good--

35:17.949 --> 35:20.251
Officer Tatum with
a hula-hooping routine!

35:20.318 --> 35:21.786
(cheering, applause)

35:21.853 --> 35:23.588
Yeah, let's go, bro.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.829

♪ Pick yourself up, drop it... ♪

35:48.312 --> 35:49.680
Hey.

35:49.747 --> 35:53.150
Hey. Thought you had
that talent show thing.

35:53.217 --> 35:56.320
I did, but, uh,
I got Luca to cover it.

35:59.790 --> 36:01.926
I owe you an apology
for earlier.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.363
I was frustrated,
but I-I never meant to imply

36:05.429 --> 36:07.231
that you don't do
your part around here.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.233
I couldn't ask
for a better partner.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.636
I couldn't ask for
a better mother for our kids.

36:11.702 --> 36:13.170
I'm sorry.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.773
Thank you.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.875
I was frustrated
with myself, too,

36:17.942 --> 36:19.944
and I probably took
some of that out on you.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.380
Eh, it happens.

36:22.446 --> 36:23.881
Mm.

36:23.948 --> 36:26.951
Annie, I know how much working
on this case means to you,

36:27.018 --> 36:28.920
and I want to support that.

36:28.986 --> 36:33.724
And I know that working SWAT
and private security is a lot.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.394
So I'm gonna cut back
on my overtime hours.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.762
Yeah, I mean,
it's time for me

36:37.828 --> 36:39.664
to start doing my part
around here.

36:39.730 --> 36:42.233
Do some errands,

36:42.300 --> 36:44.302
take the kids wherever
it is you take them.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.836
(chuckles)
Do the laundry.

36:45.903 --> 36:47.772
Whoa. Even the whites?

36:47.838 --> 36:50.741
As long as you're okay
with them turning into pinks.

36:50.808 --> 36:52.443
You don't have to do all that.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.579
No, I know.

36:54.645 --> 36:56.614
I want to.
Mm.

37:01.919 --> 37:04.956
Well, the daily chores
are all done.

37:05.022 --> 37:06.757
Ah. Darn.
(chuckles)

37:06.824 --> 37:08.826
But I could use your eyes
on some inconsistencies

37:08.893 --> 37:11.896
with these case files.
Okay.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.231
Game?
Lay it on me.

37:14.298 --> 37:15.566
Okay.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.335
All right, what do you got?

37:17.401 --> 37:19.437
This is what I wanted you
to look at.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.875
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

37:26.711 --> 37:28.479
(chuckles):
Oh, hey.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.715
Jim?
Yeah.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.516
What are you doing here?

37:32.583 --> 37:34.518
Well, uh, I made
the nurses promise

37:34.585 --> 37:36.253
to call me
the moment you woke up.

37:36.320 --> 37:39.323
You know visiting hours are over
for the night, right?

37:39.390 --> 37:41.525
Well, this is official
police business.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.394
And I don't remember it
stopping you

37:43.461 --> 37:45.029
when our roles were reversed.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.832
(laughs softly)
Hey, um, I was
gonna bring you

37:47.898 --> 37:50.568
a burrito from Norm's,
but the nurses,

37:50.635 --> 37:52.770
they... they nixed that idea.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.839
Oh...
Liquids only.

37:54.905 --> 37:57.575
(both chuckle)

37:57.642 --> 37:59.744
Beer's a liquid.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.879
Why didn't I think of that?

38:01.946 --> 38:04.782
Hey, don't laugh, don't
laugh, don't laugh.

38:04.849 --> 38:05.983
Are you feeling okay?

38:06.050 --> 38:07.518
(exhales):
Yeah, yeah.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.520
(cheering, applause)

38:09.587 --> 38:11.822
That routine's gonna be tough
to follow,

38:11.889 --> 38:13.924
but I think our next performer's
up to it.

38:13.991 --> 38:17.328

Thank you.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.406
Oh, you weren't
in the mood

39:35.473 --> 39:36.841
for terrible karaoke,
either, huh?

39:36.907 --> 39:38.509
(chuckles)

39:38.576 --> 39:39.944
No, I get enough of that
whenever Rocker sings

39:40.010 --> 39:41.479
in the locker room shower.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.148
(laughs) Yeah.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.519
I talked to Raymont Harris
today.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.421
Do I want to know?
I tried to convince him

39:50.488 --> 39:52.790
to pull out of that
business deal, but...

39:54.458 --> 39:56.460
...Saint already had
his hooks in the kid.

39:56.527 --> 39:58.596
Well, Saint's got to need
legitimate businesses

39:58.662 --> 40:00.064
to cover for his crimes.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.767
You know, maybe Raymont's
will be one of them.

40:02.833 --> 40:06.003
It's wishful thinking.
And I don't want to count on it.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.640
Well, you could keep
insisting that he's dirty,

40:09.707 --> 40:11.509
but it doesn't mean anything
until we have proof.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.077
In the meantime,

40:13.144 --> 40:16.013
you go messing with Raymont,
the media will have a field day.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.082
"It wasn't enough
SWAT shot the kid?

40:18.149 --> 40:19.884
They had to go after
his business, too?"

40:19.950 --> 40:21.152
(chuckles)

40:25.089 --> 40:29.493
Look, I know you want
to bring this guy down.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.128
But until we get
something concrete,

40:31.195 --> 40:33.664
maybe you should
let this one go.

40:35.232 --> 40:37.868
You think I was
able to put cuffs

40:37.935 --> 40:39.970
on every jackass
that deserved them?

40:40.037 --> 40:42.573
You think Buck or Mumford did?

40:42.640 --> 40:43.841
(chuckles)

40:47.044 --> 40:50.481
Good guys don't always
get the "W" in the end.

40:52.249 --> 40:54.652
And when I get
the proof we need?

40:56.620 --> 40:58.856
Then come talk to me.
