11:18.503 --> 11:20.854
Tell that to the man's family.
I met his wife, his grandson.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.116
- Okay, listen to me.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.771
Two of the best doctors
at this hospital

11:24.814 --> 11:27.077
are doing everything
they can for him right now.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.340
And Whitaker
is gonna pull through.

11:29.384 --> 11:30.820
Because that's our job.

11:30.864 --> 11:34.955
And your job is to
stop blaming yourself, okay?

11:34.998 --> 11:36.347
Another car cut you off.

11:36.391 --> 11:39.786
This is not your fault.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.831
- Wasn't a car, Lauren.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.833
I got around the car.

11:43.877 --> 11:44.921
It was me, I--
- Okay.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.096
- I was going too fast.

11:46.140 --> 11:49.056
This was all me.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.020
- We did all we could.

11:57.064 --> 12:00.067
He's gone.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.724
- [quietly] Hey, it's okay.

12:20.261 --> 12:20.435
.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.176
- Oh, Max, hey!

12:22.219 --> 12:23.830
Listen, I, um, I know things
are a little crazy

12:23.873 --> 12:25.222
around here right now.
- Yeah, beyond.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.833
- I have this thing
I need you to submit me for.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.138
It's a little time-sensitive,

12:28.182 --> 12:29.792
so I put stickies
everywhere you need to sign.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.489
- For the NAPA Prize?
Why is this time-sensitive?

12:31.533 --> 12:33.100
- They've been trying
to give it to me for years.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.797
- Yeah, and you've been
making fun of it for years.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.364
- Yeah, which was
incredibly immature of me.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.888
- I believe you called it
a spiky, ugly little award

12:38.932 --> 12:41.195
that was ironic
in its Freudian obliviousness.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.806
- Yesterday it was oblivious,
today it's prestigious.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.288
- What changed?
- Uh, our new medical director.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.376
- Veronica wants this?

12:48.419 --> 12:49.899
- Yeah, she says that I'm, uh,

12:49.943 --> 12:51.422
bringing down the department
by not practicing,

12:51.466 --> 12:53.947
and that I'm lowering
the prestige of the hospital.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.252
I thought I would
throw her a little bone--

12:55.296 --> 12:56.950
- You know what this is?
This is retaliation

12:56.993 --> 12:58.908
for me hiring Wilder
without her sign off,

12:58.952 --> 13:00.867
and now she's putting
the squeeze on you. I'm sorry.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.390
I'm trying to think
of a way to neutralize her,

13:02.433 --> 13:05.393
but I can't--
- Yeah, okay, but Max, I, um,

13:05.436 --> 13:07.830
I can't go back
to seeing patients.

13:07.874 --> 13:11.007
I'm nowhere near ready.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.270
- Yeah, it's okay.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.445
Take your time.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.056
- Okay, thank you.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.016
- All right.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.063
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.067
- Mr. Newbounde.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.895
Hi, you must be Alijah.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.419
I'm Dr. Sharpe.
This is my colleague Dr. Kao.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.116
- They say she had
a small stroke,

13:33.160 --> 13:34.901
that maybe it was
because of her sickle cell.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.076
- This stroke
may have been small

13:36.119 --> 13:37.381
but the next one may not be.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.906
- We are very sorry
to have to tell you this,

13:39.949 --> 13:42.212
but we found a blockage
in your basilar artery,

13:42.256 --> 13:44.475
which supplies blood
to the cerebellum.

13:44.519 --> 13:47.130
This is the area of the brain
that controls your motor skills

13:47.174 --> 13:49.437
and cognitive functions.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.093
- Uh, what does that mean?

13:53.136 --> 13:54.442
- Alijah's sickle cell anemia

13:54.485 --> 13:56.618
is restricting
the blood flow to her brain.

13:56.661 --> 14:00.448
- But with proper testing,
we can prevent another stroke.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.929
- Tell me, Mr. Newbounde,
has Alijah ever had

14:02.972 --> 14:04.887
trans-cranial
doppler screenings?

14:04.931 --> 14:07.281
- Of course, we relied on them.

14:07.324 --> 14:11.938
I was taking her to get 'em
once a year until last March.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.461
- Why did you stop?

14:13.504 --> 14:15.463
- The program was discontinued.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.857
- It was? Where?

14:19.119 --> 14:21.121
- Here.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.605
- Hey.

14:27.649 --> 14:28.955
- Hey. Where you heading?

14:28.998 --> 14:31.000
- OR, to plate a broken bone.
- I'll take her.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.001
- No, it's okay, I got it.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.481
- Uh--

14:33.524 --> 14:35.004
didn't you just lose someone?

14:35.048 --> 14:37.093
I need you prepping
for the M&M.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.921
- M&M?
There's nothing to review.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.054
The guy was basically gone
when we got him.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.099
Just let me take care of her.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.319
- Prep for the M&M.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.582
Last time I checked,
Dr. Reynolds,

14:47.625 --> 14:52.108
you were still my deputy
and I was still your chair.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.893
Harmony, right?

15:06.122 --> 15:08.995
- Dr. Reynolds, do you mind
if I walk with you?

15:09.038 --> 15:10.257
- Be my guest.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.912
- Um, I need your take
on something.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.174
Every department
has its strengths

15:14.217 --> 15:16.393
and weaknesses, right?

15:16.437 --> 15:19.266
But yours seems
a bit top-heavy.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.528
- I beg your pardon?

15:20.571 --> 15:22.095
- Well, you and Dr. Baptiste,

15:22.138 --> 15:23.705
both excellent surgeons,

15:23.748 --> 15:25.098
and two of our highest-paid,

15:25.141 --> 15:28.144
and yet,
you often share patients.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.016
Can you explain that?

15:30.059 --> 15:32.409
I mean, is that
really efficient?

15:32.453 --> 15:36.370
- It is, if you're trying
to save a patient's life.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.546
- Oh, okay.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.940
Well, Dr. Baptiste
had some thoughts on this.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.115
I just wanted
to check in with you.

15:42.158 --> 15:46.032
- Oh, you spoke to Baptiste?

15:46.075 --> 15:48.338
- I did, yes, this morning.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.471
- Well, what did he say?

15:50.514 --> 15:52.429
- Oh, I mean,
I can't divulge the contents

15:52.473 --> 15:54.127
of a private conversation
with you.

15:54.170 --> 15:57.347
But I will tell you that
he had some pretty bold ideas

15:57.391 --> 16:02.222
on how to rebalance
your department.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.658
- Did he?
- Mm-hmm.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.486
And I'm sure you'll
have ideas as well,

16:05.529 --> 16:08.402
so let's set up
a time to chat, yeah?

16:08.445 --> 16:11.492
I know we can cut
the suit to fit.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.021
- Right.
I understand, thank you.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.283
Where's Moreland?

16:20.327 --> 16:22.329
- Uh, he's waiting
to talk to the police.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.026
- Well, he's gonna
talk to me first.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.376
- Max, you understand
this isn't his fault, right?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.378
He's one of us. Max--

16:28.422 --> 16:30.206
- Where's the dispatch report,
Rob?

16:30.250 --> 16:33.079
- It should be
in the ambulance.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.994
- Yeah, should be,
but it isn't,

16:35.037 --> 16:36.734
because someone tore it out.

16:36.778 --> 16:39.085
- Okay, look, anything
you want from the report,

16:39.128 --> 16:40.564
you can get from 911 dispatch.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.436
- I just called 911 dispatch,

16:42.479 --> 16:45.047
and the patient that
he picked up, Mr. Santangelo,

16:45.091 --> 16:47.615
who is now dead,
didn't call 911,

16:47.658 --> 16:49.269
he called
the non-emergency line,

16:49.312 --> 16:50.661
'cause he had a fever,
and his wife was concerned.

16:50.705 --> 16:54.187
The man didn't even
need an ambulance.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.278
That's why you took
this report, isn't it?

16:58.321 --> 17:00.541
You were driving like a madman
with a non-emergent patient,

17:00.584 --> 17:05.502
whom you knew had no business
being in your vehicle!

17:21.475 --> 17:22.606
- Keep it.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.652
Or give it to the cops.

17:24.695 --> 17:27.133
I'm sure they'll
want to read it.

17:45.281 --> 17:45.716
.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.849
- Even if he was
driving recklessly,

17:47.892 --> 17:49.329
there's no way
they're gonna hang him.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.635
When a cop goes down,
who's the first on the scene?

17:51.679 --> 17:53.028
Paramedics.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.943
The blue line covers them too.

17:54.986 --> 17:57.076
- No, he shouldn't need cover.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.078
He's never done anything
like this before.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.818
- Well, that may be true,

18:00.862 --> 18:03.604
but he killed a dude
with a runny nose, Laur.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.649
And he almost killed
his partner.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.738
- Who's side are you on?

18:07.782 --> 18:10.219
- There are no sides.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.134
It's just what happened.

18:12.178 --> 18:15.094
- Well, I want to know
why it happened.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.146
- [vocalizing]

18:24.190 --> 18:25.843
Uh, Lauren.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.062
Did you get my message?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.890
- Uh, I didn't know
you left me one.

18:28.933 --> 18:31.153
- I did. I wanted to thank you.

18:31.197 --> 18:35.157
- Mm, for what?
- For your donation.

18:35.201 --> 18:38.291
The donation you made to
the Dean's discretionary fund

18:38.334 --> 18:39.640
a few months back?

18:39.683 --> 18:41.598
I came across it
in the financials.

18:41.642 --> 18:45.211
That was very,
very generous of you.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.825
Are--are you not comfortable
discussing this?

18:50.868 --> 18:53.697
- No, no, um, I just--

18:53.741 --> 18:57.005
money stuff, I like
to keep things confidential.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.050
- Oh, yeah, no, no,
of course, of course.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.183
- Yeah, it's a--
it's a family trust,

19:01.227 --> 19:04.143
so you know, we make donations
like this all the time.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.057
It's nothing special.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.408
- Oh. Well, if that's the case,

19:08.451 --> 19:10.105
you might consider
a second gift

19:10.149 --> 19:13.413
to the hospital's endowment.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.850
- A second, um--

19:15.893 --> 19:17.286
uh, I don't know, uh,

19:17.330 --> 19:20.637
I'd have to talk to my mother
and my sister and--

19:20.681 --> 19:22.204
- Mm-hmm.
- And the lawyer.

19:22.248 --> 19:25.686
Uh, I don't make
these decisions alone, so.

19:25.729 --> 19:29.124
- Is--is Dr. Shinwari involved?

19:29.168 --> 19:32.083
If so, I'd like to extend
my gratitude to her as well.

19:32.127 --> 19:34.085
- No.

19:34.129 --> 19:37.350
I mean, she doesn't know
that we do this.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.699
- Mm.

19:38.742 --> 19:41.658
- And I'd like to
keep it that way.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.226
- Gotcha.

19:44.270 --> 19:47.882
Okay, well, have a think
about the endowment.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.840
Your money would go
much further there.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.233
And it wouldn't
have to be a lump sum gift.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.236
We could work out
a quarterly situation.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.674
And Leyla doesn't have
to know about that either.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.379
- Dr. Ketner.
- Helen. Good morning.

20:06.422 --> 20:07.989
- I understand that
we're no longer offering

20:08.032 --> 20:10.034
doppler screenings.
Can you tell me why?

20:10.078 --> 20:12.080
- No funding.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.255
- Since then?

20:13.299 --> 20:16.954
- Since you
reallocated the money.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.782
- Since I reallocated it?

20:18.826 --> 20:21.132
- In the early days
of the pandemic.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.352
- No, no, no.
Listen, it's not possible.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.789
There's no way
that I would cut a vital test.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.965
- No one was coming in
for any tests then,

20:28.009 --> 20:30.011
so you asked if we could
move some money around

20:30.054 --> 20:33.275
to treat the effects
of long-term COVID.

20:35.973 --> 20:38.759
- But I--I didn't mean--

20:38.802 --> 20:42.371
I didn't realize that it, um,
that it never came back.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.852
- A lot of tests
never came back.

20:44.895 --> 20:49.335
Whole departments
never came back.

20:49.378 --> 20:53.774
- But this test
saves lives and...

20:57.386 --> 20:58.866
[knocking on door]

20:58.909 --> 21:00.824
- Yeah. Hey, come in.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.871
- Congratulations, Dr. Frome.
I think.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.874
Dr. Fuentes just called.
She wanted us to know

21:06.917 --> 21:10.007
that you are being awarded
this year's NAPA Prize.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.183
- Yes! Oh, what?

21:12.227 --> 21:14.055
So it happened. I got it.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.057
I got the award? And she knows.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.364
- Yes.
- Oh!

21:18.407 --> 21:21.062
- Why do you look so excited?
I thought you didn't want

21:21.105 --> 21:22.498
anything to do with
the NAPA people?

21:22.542 --> 21:24.283
I mean, you said
their hearts were...

21:24.326 --> 21:25.284
both: Black and rotten.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.285
- Yeah, I know what I said.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.808
But she sounded happy about it?

21:27.851 --> 21:30.941
About the--she was happy
about the prestige of it all?

21:30.985 --> 21:32.160
- She did.

21:32.203 --> 21:34.771
In fact, I mean, she suggested

21:34.815 --> 21:36.338
that you make a point
of mentioning the award

21:36.382 --> 21:38.906
to all of your newpatients.

21:38.949 --> 21:41.256
Which surprised me,
because I didn't know

21:41.300 --> 21:45.347
you were seeing new patients.

21:48.002 --> 21:51.222
- She still wants me
seeing patients?

21:51.266 --> 21:53.355
- She wanted me to confirm that
they were on your schedule

21:53.399 --> 21:57.054
for today.

21:57.098 --> 22:00.275
- No.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.886
Oh--

22:02.930 --> 22:05.149
oh, God, no.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.195
No. No! No!

22:07.238 --> 22:08.936
That's--
- Iggy.

22:08.979 --> 22:11.112
- I--my--my--oh,

22:11.155 --> 22:12.940
I can feel my throat
closing up, literally.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.811
[clears throat]
- Okay, okay.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.160
Now, just--just breathe.
- Oh, God.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.946
- You are so good with people.

22:18.989 --> 22:22.036
You are so empathetic.
- No, no, no, not right now.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.298
I would be damaging
to them, Gladys.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.734
I'm--I'm--I--

22:24.778 --> 22:26.519
watching your shrink
pass out from lack of oxygen,

22:26.562 --> 22:27.824
that's not--[clears throat]

22:27.868 --> 22:30.349
that's not helpful, mm-mm.

22:32.481 --> 22:35.092
- Is--

22:35.136 --> 22:38.922
is this still about Chance?

22:38.966 --> 22:39.967
- Yeah.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.883
Yes, it's about Chance.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.275
It's about Chance.
It's about everybody.

22:44.319 --> 22:45.625
It's about everyone
who's ever sat on that couch

22:45.668 --> 22:46.974
and made their nightmares mine.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.410
I took them all on
and made them mine.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.325
I took them all on, and I--

22:50.369 --> 22:53.154
I just was starting
to feel like--

22:53.197 --> 22:55.156
I just was starting to have
dreams of my own again,

22:55.199 --> 22:59.856
you know, and I--
and not confuse everything.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.992
- Okay.
Yep, Iggy, just breathe.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.341
- Yeah.
- It's okay.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.342
- Mmkay, okay, all right.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.170
- Yeah, it's just--okay.
- Mm.

23:09.213 --> 23:12.347
- So, what do you think
you want to do?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.479
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Okay.

23:13.522 --> 23:18.658
- I don't know. Um, I, uh--

23:18.701 --> 23:21.878
I think, uh...

23:27.144 --> 23:30.147
Resign.

23:38.025 --> 23:40.201
- Floyd, you need something?
- I'm here to see my patient.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.594
- Did you do the work
for your M&M?

23:41.637 --> 23:42.682
- Yes, I did.

23:42.725 --> 23:45.032
What have you done
for Ms. Perez?

23:45.075 --> 23:46.947
- Nothing, because
she's stable.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.514
- For now.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.516
- Which, last time I checked,

23:50.559 --> 23:52.300
that was a good thing.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.954
- I need to put that plate in.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.130
- And I told you not to.

23:57.523 --> 23:58.567
[alarm ringing]

23:58.611 --> 24:01.440
- [choked coughing]
- Oh.

24:01.483 --> 24:05.269
- [gasping]
- She can't breathe.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.402
- [choked coughing]

24:07.446 --> 24:08.664
- Collapsed lung and
internal bleeding.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.144
- All right,
she needs an OR now.

24:10.187 --> 24:13.495
- Dr. Baptiste, Ms. Garcia's
heart rate's plummeting.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.280
- Better tend to your patient,
doctor.

24:16.324 --> 24:19.370
[alarms ringing]
- [choked coughing]

24:19.414 --> 24:23.549
- It's okay, it's okay.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.468
- So what's the emergency?

24:29.511 --> 24:32.688
- Mr. Santangelo lived
on the Upper East Side.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.037
- What were you doing 40 blocks

24:34.081 --> 24:35.299
outside the hospital
jurisdiction?

24:35.343 --> 24:36.518
Is that why you were
driving so fast,

24:36.562 --> 24:38.607
just to make up the miles?

24:42.437 --> 24:44.570
- This is me now, Rob,

24:44.613 --> 24:47.442
not the police.

24:47.486 --> 24:52.012
And you need to tell me
why this happened.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.231
- We were ordered
to make the pickup.

24:54.275 --> 24:57.191
- What? Ordered by who?

25:00.542 --> 25:02.762
- Our battalion chief.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.111
- Why?

25:04.154 --> 25:05.547
Why were you driving
1,000 miles an hour

25:05.591 --> 25:06.548
for a man with a fever?

25:06.592 --> 25:09.595
- Hey, look--

25:09.638 --> 25:12.423
we were told
to ignore jurisdiction.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.469
Grab any patient we could
anywhere in the city,

25:14.513 --> 25:16.297
then drive bat out of hell
to make the drop

25:16.340 --> 25:17.646
so we can get back out
onto the street

25:17.690 --> 25:19.430
as soon as possible.
- That's insane.

25:19.474 --> 25:22.433
Why would he tell you
to do that?

25:22.477 --> 25:24.740
- Private ambulance companies
are killing us, Lauren.

25:24.784 --> 25:27.047
This is how you compete.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.310
- Your chief, he's done.

25:29.353 --> 25:30.398
- It wasn't his idea.

25:30.441 --> 25:33.444
- Oh, yeah? Then whose was it?

25:33.488 --> 25:38.406
- Dr. Fuentes,
your new medical director.

25:56.946 --> 25:57.164
.

25:57.207 --> 26:00.820
- You're coming to me
for money.

26:00.863 --> 26:03.126
- Uh, yes, I realize

26:03.170 --> 26:04.824
that we started off
on the wrong foot,

26:04.867 --> 26:06.913
and I am sorry
about that, but--

26:06.956 --> 26:11.787
- You thought I was a superfan
trolling the halls.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.354
- Yes, well,
obviously, I've been

26:13.397 --> 26:16.400
making tons of mistakes lately,
but I'm here to own them.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.707
I, um--

26:18.751 --> 26:21.667
I cut funding
off the doppler screenings

26:21.710 --> 26:23.799
for our sickle cell patients.

26:23.843 --> 26:26.019
It was the peak of COVID
and we were moving fast--

26:26.062 --> 26:29.718
obviously too fast--and I--

26:29.762 --> 26:32.895
um--

26:32.939 --> 26:35.289
okay, look,

26:35.332 --> 26:39.119
I take every part of my job
incredibly seriously,

26:39.162 --> 26:42.339
but the part that I view
as more than a job,

26:42.383 --> 26:46.343
as, um, as a higher duty,

26:46.387 --> 26:50.217
is taking care of children.

26:50.260 --> 26:53.916
And I have let one down.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.135
In the ICU right now,

26:55.178 --> 26:56.832
I have a patient
who may never walk again,

26:56.876 --> 26:58.312
and she is 14.

26:58.355 --> 27:01.228
She had a stroke, a stroke
that may have been avoided

27:01.271 --> 27:03.447
had I have not
ended the program.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.798
So I have come here
to ask you--

27:05.841 --> 27:07.800
to beg you for the money,

27:07.843 --> 27:09.366
so that I can reinstate
the program,

27:09.410 --> 27:13.936
so this can never happen again.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.722
- You know how bad
the financials are, right?

27:16.765 --> 27:19.768
And that's why
the board brought me in.

27:19.812 --> 27:22.989
- Yeah.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.338
- But I hear you,

27:24.381 --> 27:28.821
and I appreciate
you taking responsibility.

27:28.864 --> 27:34.000
I don't think every program
is worth keeping.

27:34.043 --> 27:38.308
But this one sounds
like it might be.

27:38.352 --> 27:43.052
So I will find a way
to get you that money.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.533
- Um--

27:45.576 --> 27:51.234
thank you. Thank you.
- [chuckles]

27:51.278 --> 27:54.411
I don't have a lot of friends
around here,

27:54.455 --> 27:56.413
and even though you're leaving,
I--I hope

27:56.457 --> 27:58.111
that I can count you as one

27:58.154 --> 28:00.243
until you're out the door.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.071
- Absolutely.

28:02.115 --> 28:04.987
Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

28:12.125 --> 28:16.825
- So the source of the blood
in her lungs was her leg.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.784
- She had a fractured rib.
I fixed that.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.829
Now I'm onto the leg.
- She has osteoporotic bones.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.091
That's why there are
two fractures,

28:22.135 --> 28:23.440
and that's why
the screws will never hold,

28:23.484 --> 28:25.442
and why I didn't want you
taking her to the OR.

28:25.486 --> 28:28.097
- Which is why
I'm trying something new,

28:28.141 --> 28:29.882
expandible pedicle screws.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.187
- They'll never hold
without cement.

28:31.231 --> 28:34.234
- Hey, nurse,
could you bring me the cement?

28:40.980 --> 28:43.286
- I'm sure your
novel surgical technique

28:43.330 --> 28:44.897
will impress
our new medical director.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.333
- As opposed to you
trying to impress her

28:46.376 --> 28:49.466
by sending me to do
a completely unnecessary M&M.

28:49.510 --> 28:53.122
Hope that helps
your rebalancing.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.472
- Who don't we do this
together, Dr. Reynolds,

28:55.516 --> 28:56.996
since we're so good at sharing,

28:57.039 --> 28:59.085
and save the rest
of this discussion for later?

28:59.128 --> 29:02.044
Nurse, scalpel, please.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.662
- You're not resining.
- I am.

29:11.706 --> 29:15.492
I mean, I think I am. I guess.

29:15.536 --> 29:18.191
I don't know, what other--
what other options do I have?

29:18.234 --> 29:21.629
- Iggy, we just blew through
all our savings

29:21.672 --> 29:23.936
driving across country,
living in an RV for months.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.938
- I know, I know,
and the odds of me

29:25.981 --> 29:27.417
actually getting a job
at any other hospital

29:27.461 --> 29:29.855
where I don't have
to see patients, is

29:29.898 --> 29:31.160
slim to none, at best.

29:31.204 --> 29:35.121
And I'm--

29:35.164 --> 29:37.645
I don't--I mean,
I don't know what to do.

29:37.688 --> 29:39.168
Martin, I'm asking you
to tell me what to do.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.997
I don't know what to do.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.607
- Trust your own words,
all right?

29:43.651 --> 29:45.435
All you ever say is
how much you love this place.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.873
- I do.

29:47.916 --> 29:50.353
I do love it.

29:50.397 --> 29:51.528
But I can't--I can't--

29:51.572 --> 29:54.357
I can't see patients anymore.

29:54.401 --> 29:58.318
I can't.

29:58.361 --> 30:02.496
- Can't now or forever?

30:02.539 --> 30:05.238
- I don't know.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.630
I don't know, I don't know.

30:06.674 --> 30:09.285
I don't know the answer
to that question. I--

30:09.329 --> 30:12.941
and I just--[clears throat]

30:12.985 --> 30:15.683
seeing a patient, I just--

30:15.726 --> 30:18.729
I--my heart begins to race,

30:18.773 --> 30:23.299
and my--my palms get sweaty,
and I--

30:23.343 --> 30:24.997
I can't do it. I can't.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.217
I just envision
all of the people

30:28.261 --> 30:31.264
that I'm gonna hurt
because I'm not ready.

30:31.307 --> 30:36.704
And I'm not willing to do that.

30:36.747 --> 30:40.664
- Okay.

30:40.708 --> 30:45.191
Resign.

30:45.234 --> 30:46.714
- Are--are you sure?

30:46.757 --> 30:49.325
I mean, if you're not
completely on board, I'll--

30:49.369 --> 30:52.067
you know, say the word,
I'll figure it out.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.156
- We'll figure it out.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.419
That's what we do.

30:56.463 --> 31:01.076
Hand this in.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.209
- What about the money?

31:03.252 --> 31:07.256
- Babe, you're going through
something really big.

31:07.300 --> 31:11.608
The money isn't as important.

31:11.652 --> 31:15.264
If we need to move, we'll move.

31:15.308 --> 31:18.050
If the kids
need to start new schools,

31:18.093 --> 31:21.749
they'll adapt.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.142
We'll all adapt,

31:23.185 --> 31:27.668
'cause that's what
families do for each other.

31:27.711 --> 31:30.714
I love you.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.419
- Yes.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.160
I told them to drive faster.

31:41.203 --> 31:42.770
- Someone died!

31:42.813 --> 31:45.033
- What kind of
insane, reckless--

31:45.077 --> 31:46.687
- Dr. Bloom, are you aware

31:46.730 --> 31:48.994
that the majority
of paramedics in this city

31:49.037 --> 31:50.517
work for private
ambulance companies?

31:50.560 --> 31:51.910
- So what?

31:51.953 --> 31:54.521
I mean, we have a contract
with the fire department.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.523
- Which I told them
we'd terminate

31:56.566 --> 31:58.003
unless they got competitive.

31:58.046 --> 32:00.396
- So you blackmailed them.
Great.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.442
- Max, the private
ambulance companies

32:02.485 --> 32:04.313
all have backroom deals

32:04.357 --> 32:06.446
with the private hospitals.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.709
They are strongly encouraged
to only pick up

32:08.752 --> 32:11.668
insured patients,
the big ticket procedures,

32:11.712 --> 32:13.148
the money makers,

32:13.192 --> 32:15.237
which leaves the uninsured,

32:15.281 --> 32:17.544
the homeless,
and the poor for us.

32:17.587 --> 32:20.199
- We are a public hospital!

32:20.242 --> 32:26.292
- That desperately
needs money to survive, Max.

32:26.335 --> 32:27.771
- [scoffs]

32:27.815 --> 32:30.470
- So I incentivized the chief

32:30.513 --> 32:33.342
by making him realize
that a win for us

32:33.386 --> 32:34.735
is also a win for him.

32:34.778 --> 32:36.780
- Mm, well,
killing our patients

32:36.824 --> 32:38.826
isn't exactly a win.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.523
- [sighs]

32:40.567 --> 32:45.137
I am truly sorry about
what happened this morning.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.182
But accidents can happen
at any speed.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.706
- So what exactly did you say
to the fire chief?

32:49.750 --> 32:52.318
I mean, how far are they
supposed to just drive around,
