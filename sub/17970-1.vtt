WEBVTT

00:15.974 --> 00:18.309
Get away from me.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.401
Leave me alone.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.326
Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.327
0900 hours, weather calm.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.539
Arrived at St. Germain Island
from the southeast.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.250
No apparent flares or signal fires.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.461
The contact
is not at the rendezvous site.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.338
All signs point to the pandemic
originating on this island.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.008
There are no other options.
I must find a cure.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.053
I'll head inland, take a look around.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.474
Do you know the way to San Jose?

01:40.100 --> 01:43.853
-What?
-Do you know the way to San Jose?

03:34.464 --> 03:35.756
Is this what it was like?

03:35.924 --> 03:38.384
When you came for me
at Arctic Biosystems?

03:38.552 --> 03:41.178
They'd cleaned most of the mess
by the time we got there.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.347
No, not the mess.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.601
This feeling.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.936
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.439
Yeah, you do.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.567
This is just the beginning.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.071
CDC One, this is Manitou. Sitrep.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.489
This is Kyle.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.325
This is CDC One. What was that?

04:02.492 --> 04:04.201
We're asking for a Sitrep,
Dr. Sommer.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.871
Situation report, remember?

04:07.623 --> 04:09.248
Sorry.

04:09.416 --> 04:14.545
Dr. Jordan and Dr. Farragut
are still inside the boat, I'm up on top.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.760
Whatever killed these people
was fast and aggressive.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.970
Any indication this is the Narvik virus?

04:23.138 --> 04:26.474
Just tell the captain we don't know
what the hell happened yet.

04:27.643 --> 04:28.684
But it's not Narvik.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.818
You check further down there.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.820
Meet up top in 10.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.572
Yeah.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.040
I've got one dead in the engine room.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.376
All right. Keep your eyes open.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.921
For what? This place is a tomb.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.256
Gotta make sure
we got them all accounted for.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.009
We'll check against the manifest.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.970
Copy that.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.186
Two more in the galley.

05:15.607 --> 05:18.192
Same symptoms as the others.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.906
You got something?

05:24.074 --> 05:25.700
These two killed each other.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.785
What makes you say that?

05:27.953 --> 05:30.955
I'm seeing stab marks.
Both holding weapons.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.957
Maybe some kind of psychotic epi--

05:33.917 --> 05:34.959
Don't touch me.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.627
-Just calm down.
-Leave me alone.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.634
-Please, I am a doctor.
-Leave me alone, you freak.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.058
-You okay?
-What did you give her?

05:51.226 --> 05:53.853
-Twenty cc's Midazolam. Are you okay?
-Why'd you do that?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.439
Midazolam can mask any antibodies
she would've had...

05:56.606 --> 05:59.275
...to become immune
to whatever is going on here.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.945
-You're welcome.
-I'm sorry, okay?

06:03.113 --> 06:06.115
But immunity in a situation like this
is more than just a clue.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.993
It's everything.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.413
When did the passengers
start getting sick?

06:14.833 --> 06:19.253
About two, no, three days ago.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.297
Right after we got back
from the island.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.093
-What island?
-I don't know. It was a side trip.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.887
It wasn't even in the brochure.

06:28.055 --> 06:32.308
We just moored offshore,
hiked around, went swimming.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.686
We spent the day there
and we set sail that night.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.731
Anyone report feeling strange
when they got back?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.524
Not at first.

06:40.692 --> 06:45.404
But then on the third day,
the screaming started.

06:48.116 --> 06:52.203
I just-- I hid in the engine room
and I tried to stay quiet.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.583
But I could hear them
killing each other.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.420
Every time I thought it was over,
I would hear another scream.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.883
I was afraid to fall asleep.

07:06.843 --> 07:11.847
I started having
these waking nightmares.

07:12.974 --> 07:16.727
And so then when you came in wearing
that suit, I didn't know if you were real...

07:16.895 --> 07:18.437
...or if you were just, like, a--

07:18.605 --> 07:21.899
CDC One, this is Manitou. Sitrep.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.528
Means they're asking
for a situation report.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.238
Yeah, I have done this before.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.158
Field autopsies
show a consistent pattern.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.661
The pathogen overloaded
the body's immune response.

07:33.829 --> 07:37.248
-Primarily attacking the digestive system.
-Highly unlikely it's airborne.

07:37.415 --> 07:41.377
-We can get out of those biohazard suits.
-And you're sure it's not the Narvik virus?

07:41.545 --> 07:45.756
The most likely scenario is some infection
contracted from the island they visited.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.844
Our survivor referred to it
as Saint something.

07:50.011 --> 07:54.014
St. Germain. It's about 12 nautical miles
northwest of here, just over the horizon.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.224
We need to go there.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.018
My orders were to investigate
a possible Narvik outbreak.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.604
Captain, we have 27 people dead
onboard that boat.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.440
Our assessment is done
and our mission is complete.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.777
-We still need to get to St. Germain.
-My orders in this situation...

08:06.945 --> 08:10.489
...are to leave a tracking buoy on-site
and take your team back to Seattle.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.908
Then I'm declaring
a national health threat.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.451
-Jesus.
-Peter, hold on.

08:14.619 --> 08:18.122
Coast Guard regulations give me authority
to conduct an inspection...

08:18.290 --> 08:22.668
...if I have cause to believe there is
a threat to any nearby population center.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.212
Seattle is less than 20 hours away.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.716
-I'm ordering you to take us.
-You don't give orders on this ship.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.562
I'm sorry. Wrong choice of words.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.448
Bridge, this is the captain.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.119
Plot a course to St. Germain. Underway
when ready. Make turns for 30 knots.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.121
Aye, captain.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.376
Let's be clear
on what's going to happen.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.129
Legally I can't go ashore.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.839
Nor can I wait around.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.134
I'm under orders to take
your field samples back for lab analysis.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.511
So you'll be on your own.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.764
This is the back end of nowhere.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.683
So sat-phone and radio service
will be extremely limited.

09:19.851 --> 09:23.395
There's no landing strip on the island
and it's well beyond chopper range.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.026
So you'll have to wait until another ship
can be dispatched to pick you up.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.654
Figure two weeks.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.387
Hey, where are you taking me?

09:59.975 --> 10:01.100
Hey, put me down.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.770
Put me down.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.732
Help!

10:08.900 --> 10:09.984
Help!

10:10.443 --> 10:12.695
What do you want from me?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.281
Come on, put me down.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.040
Thanks again for doing this.

10:25.208 --> 10:29.628
I know you'd probably rather be in a bunk
on your way back to Seattle right now.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.507
I figured I should do something.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.884
Yeah.

10:36.303 --> 10:41.515
You're the only person we have here
who's been here before, so....

10:41.683 --> 10:45.269
We need to know where you
and the passengers went.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.856
What you ate, drank.
Where you went swimming.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.694
I don't know how much I'll remember.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.155
Anything at all will be helpful.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.493
You brought a gun?

11:01.953 --> 11:03.287
I'm from Texas.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.290
We don't go to the bathroom
without a gun.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.625
Okay.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.339
Mind if I ask you a personal question?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.758
Yes. Very much.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.760
I did save your life.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.721
So that entitles you
to pry into my personal life?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.806
Yeah, that's right.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.267
Okay.

11:28.063 --> 11:31.523
You think Alan Farragut
really blew up that building in Paris?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.443
What the hell kind of a question
is that?

11:34.611 --> 11:37.321
People say you knew him.
Really well, in fact.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.866
Yeah, I thought I did.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.461
I think we came this way.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.349
Do you remember seeing or hearing
anything unusual?

12:05.517 --> 12:07.434
What about the running water?

12:11.439 --> 12:12.773
I'm not sure.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.536
Do we have any idea
where we're going?

12:25.703 --> 12:27.413
We've been walking around
for a while.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.416
I'm not sure. Why are you whispering?

12:30.667 --> 12:33.877
I don't know. It just feels right to whisper,
don't you think?

12:34.045 --> 12:37.047
Really? You're doing this now?
Can we just focus on the task at--

12:37.215 --> 12:38.799
Oh, my God. What the hell is that?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.222
Dwarf Cottontail.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.100
Pretty common at this latitude.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.562
Although they usually come with eyes.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.771
Bring the rabbit.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.026
So there are animals here.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.791
No!

13:12.959 --> 13:14.751
Leila, wait.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.923
Leila. Leila.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.092
Leila. Stop.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.927
Leila.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.486
Leila.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.739
Look out.

13:49.829 --> 13:55.250
Look, I don't know who you are,
but I'm not here to harm you.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.562
My name is Julia.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.272
If you would just hear me out.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.153
Do you know the way to San Jose?

14:27.450 --> 14:28.951
Leila.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.689
Somebody help me.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.527
-This is going to hurt.
-Oh, really? Gee, you're good.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.405
Doctors really are the worst patients.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.866
There we go.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.001
Oh, my God.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.253
Sorry. Swallowed my gum.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.714
Oh, my God.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.341
Not too bad. Nasty looking though.

15:26.801 --> 15:27.926
Gonna leave a scar.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.470
Only if you do a shitty job sewing it up.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.264
But I got the shakes, doc.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.521
Sorry, but infection's
your biggest worry here.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.107
Thanks, but I don't think
that's gonna be an issue.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.693
Right. You're a germ commando now.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.195
Ever since that thing
at Arctic Biosystems.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.072
What thing?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.617
I heard you and your team
went all Navy SEAL.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.661
Burned the place to the ground
to contain the outbreak.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.204
Yeah, something like that.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.831
Been dying to ask you about it.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.917
Ever since I recognized you
back in Seattle.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.336
You recognized me?

16:02.503 --> 16:04.796
Yeah, you're quite the celebrity now
at the CDC.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.591
Jumping into every crisis imaginable.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.635
That's why they call you "Hot Zone."

16:09.802 --> 16:11.136
They call me what?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.388
Now, does the pointy end
go down or up?

16:13.556 --> 16:16.642
-Never mind, I'll figure it out.
-Oh, you are such an ass.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.602
Pointy end goes down, I knew it.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.064
Come on, you know
you're gonna tell me eventually.

16:27.111 --> 16:30.072
I haven't seen Alan Farragut in a year,
okay?

16:30.573 --> 16:34.242
I don't know where he is or what
he's doing and frankly I don't care.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.455
You okay?

16:38.623 --> 16:41.583
Yeah. I'm fine.
I fell into this animal trap.

16:46.464 --> 16:50.550
That's a punji trap
and it's not used to catch rabbits.

16:50.718 --> 16:55.013
-It's used to catch humans.
-See? I did see someone.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.599
-Maybe.
-Yeah? What did you see exactly?

16:57.767 --> 17:01.436
Well, I'm not sure, but I thought I saw
a woman in the brush and I guess I--

17:01.604 --> 17:02.813
You panicked.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.106
If there is someone...

17:04.273 --> 17:07.651
...they may've eaten the same thing
that killed the people on that boat.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.987
Which makes it all the more important
that we find out what it is.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.864
Isolate it so we can treat them.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.701
Leila, I want you to take us
to where you folks ate.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.327
That's the most likely place...

17:17.495 --> 17:19.996
...someone might have
started sampling the local flora.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.546
Leila? Are you all right?

17:33.469 --> 17:34.928
There's some--

17:36.180 --> 17:39.474
There's--
There's something over there.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.524
I don't see anyone.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.863
At the base of-- At the base of the trees.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.239
It's smiling at me.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.658
I don't think you need to be afraid.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.660
It's all going to be okay.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.996
No, I see it too.

18:04.459 --> 18:05.959
Okay.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.003
Okay, wait here.

18:34.113 --> 18:38.200
It's human, adult, probably female.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.993
And she's not alone.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.138
Leila?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.183
Leila!

20:03.703 --> 20:05.453
Do you know the way to San Jose?

20:08.583 --> 20:09.875
I don't understand.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.336
Do you know the way to San Jose?

20:13.504 --> 20:15.005
You mean from here?

20:16.132 --> 20:19.217
Do you know the way to San Jose?

20:19.427 --> 20:22.387
Yes. No.
What the hell do you want me to say?

20:46.454 --> 20:47.996
Okay, okay.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.708
Okay, yeah, yes, I know the way.
You know I know the way.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.753
Yes, I know the way. No.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.588
Leila?

20:56.756 --> 20:57.964
Leila?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.091
Here. More blood.

21:00.301 --> 21:03.053
That's, call it 20 feet
from the last drops?

21:03.262 --> 21:05.722
Relatively large drops.
Major blood vessel likely.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.599
But not arterial.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.354
-She can't be that far ahead of us.
-It's gonna be dark soon.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.815
-Where the hell could she be?
-I've got a good guess.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.117
No.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.245
No.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.300
Texas.

21:45.096 --> 21:46.596
Please don't. No.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.348
Stop. Stop.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.686
Please don't. Please don't.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.313
No. No. No.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.190
No. Please don't. No.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.385
I knew one day you'd come.

23:13.267 --> 23:16.936
We should split up to look for Leila.
Cover more ground independently.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.438
Really, Hot Zone?

23:18.606 --> 23:21.524
How much ground you think
you're gonna cover with that foot?

23:23.986 --> 23:27.280
-My foot's gonna be fine, all right?
-Don't try to pull that shit.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.699
You're going to deny
what I'm capable of?

23:30.409 --> 23:33.453
Immunity from infection
and an extraordinary recovery system...

23:33.621 --> 23:36.539
...hasn't made you special, Sarah.
Just reckless.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.333
It's a gift, Peter.

23:38.876 --> 23:40.043
Here we go.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.550
More blood. A lot more.

23:47.718 --> 23:51.387
This is more of a pool than individual
droplets. She was held here for a while.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.891
If she's losing blood at this rate,
she's going to bleed out soon.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.060
-Dr. Sommer, are you hurt?
-What?

23:57.228 --> 24:00.230
-Your arm.
-No, I don't think so.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.234
Oh, my God.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.029
Oh, my God.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.199
Turn off your lights.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.201
-What?
-Just do it.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.912
-What's going on?
-Look.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.415
It's out in the trees. See it?

24:43.691 --> 24:46.276
How many rounds you got in that gun,
Texas?

24:46.443 --> 24:48.111
Not nearly enough.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.737
Please, come outside.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.322
I promise you won't be harmed.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.118
Well?

24:56.036 --> 24:58.746
It's either that or go out
like Butch and Sundance.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.624
-What the hell does that mean?
-What?

25:01.792 --> 25:04.919
You've never seen
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid?

25:05.546 --> 25:07.297
What kind of American are you?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.924
Grab your things. Let's go.

25:30.529 --> 25:34.824
I'm Dr. Peter Farragut, with the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.242
My name is Anne.

25:36.410 --> 25:39.120
You should know you're
trespassing on private property.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.789
There's a dead woman inside.

25:41.957 --> 25:45.543
She was murdered.
By someone on this island.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.087
I'm sorry. Was she a friend?

25:48.964 --> 25:50.340
Yeah.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.508
There's no need to lie.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.720
All right then, we just met her.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.722
-How's that?
-You need to come with us.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.309
-Why?
-The island is dangerous.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.604
-And we can offer you shelter.
-What about Leila's body? We need it.

26:04.772 --> 26:05.813
There's no time.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.943
-What are you afraid of?
-We'll explain everything.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.569
Now, please, come with us.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.298
Okay.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.052
Let's start over.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.472
You know my name.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.475
What do I call you?

26:45.271 --> 26:46.604
Caleb.

26:47.481 --> 26:50.149
All right, Caleb.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.824
Can I get some water?

27:15.384 --> 27:17.927
You're gonna have to
help me with that.

27:28.856 --> 27:34.068
I didn't come here
to hurt you or anyone else.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.279
You've heard of the outbreak
on the mainland?

27:36.447 --> 27:38.489
The one they're calling TXM-7.

27:39.241 --> 27:42.618
We have reason to believe the TXM-7
pandemic began here on this island.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.038
-There's no one sick here.
-Maybe not now.

27:45.205 --> 27:48.666
But 30 years ago, a chain of events
was set in motion. Right here.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.628
I may be able to find a cure,
but I need answers.

27:54.465 --> 27:57.633
Since when are your kind
interested in mortal problems?

27:57.843 --> 27:59.594
Since we started dying too.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.972
Bullshit.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.270
Left shoulder. Take a look.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.619
I'm dying.

29:42.197 --> 29:45.283
We didn't mean to trespass,
but this is an emergency situation.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.535
We're talking about
a virulent pathogen.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.287
Coast Guard food was terrible.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.373
Beans in the chili,
I mean, that's just wrong.

29:52.583 --> 29:57.336
I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but
Leila was murdered, that much is clear.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.797
No. Never seen that many
bodies in one place.

30:00.007 --> 30:02.467
We need access
to your facility and personnel.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.218
I'm afraid we can't allow that.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.180
Our membership has cut all ties
with the outside world.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.223
Come on, now. You're talking to us.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.600
Doesn't hurt, does it?

30:10.809 --> 30:12.185
This is a sanctuary.

30:13.520 --> 30:18.149
The people who've joined us, they're
trying to get away from people like you.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.943
-Sister Amy.
-Are we really that bad?

30:21.111 --> 30:23.696
You'd remind them of things
they left behind.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.199
And many of those are painful.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.868
You're doctors.
I'm sure you don't want to cause pain.

30:29.036 --> 30:32.121
No. We don't.
And please believe me when I tell you...

30:32.289 --> 30:35.625
...that we have nothing but the
utmost respect for your beliefs.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.502
You're lying again.

30:44.301 --> 30:47.553
-Don't believe I caught your name, ma'am.
-You weren't introduced.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.694
I know you want to protect us.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.531
I can assure you
we don't need your protection.

31:06.698 --> 31:11.285
Brother Michael provides for the safety
of our physical, as well as spiritual lives.

31:11.495 --> 31:14.413
-And who's Brother Michael?
-He's a man.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.374
Just like you.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.750
No more or less.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.210
I'd like to speak with him.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.675
You don't speak to Michael.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.010
He speaks to you.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.558
And when does that happen?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.685
Why, right now, Dr. Farragut.

31:42.150 --> 31:46.112
Doctors Farragut,
Sommer, and Jordan, right?

31:46.321 --> 31:47.947
I'm Michael.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.615
Welcome.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.868
Allow me to return your credentials.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.417
I'm very glad
Anne found you before too long.

32:00.127 --> 32:03.671
This island is quite dangerous
outside these walls.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.465
Home to two species
of black bear and the Labrador wolf.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.260
That's why we
keep the perimeter electrified.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.971
There's something more dangerous
than wolves and bears.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.016
-Someone killed our friend.
-Friend? Please sit.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.143
Our acquaintance.

32:17.728 --> 32:21.480
I suppose you might find
the distinction trivial...

32:22.399 --> 32:26.235
...but we believe words have truth in them,
we believe that they have meaning.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.947
Acquaintances. Friends. Family.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.616
Lovers.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.286
Those are definitions, not labels.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.914
But here I am counseling you
and you're not here for that, are you?

32:39.124 --> 32:42.877
No. But we are here
to find a truth as well.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.087
A medical truth,
but a truth nonetheless.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.715
-So I gather.
-Oh, yeah?

32:47.883 --> 32:51.052
You listen in on our little conversation
with the ladies?

32:52.137 --> 32:54.430
I love to eavesdrop.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.557
It's a terrible habit, I know.

32:56.725 --> 33:01.520
I picked it up from my mother, who was
notorious for hanging about keyholes.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.981
I'm afraid I couldn't help myself.

33:04.191 --> 33:07.568
Speaking of helping, may want to
ask your people to stop eating the food.

33:11.948 --> 33:12.990
How's that?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.701
Victims on the ship
ingested something on this island.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.954
We don't know that for sure,
but your food and water supply...

33:19.122 --> 33:21.707
...may be contaminated
by a toxic metabolite.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.460
We've been growing our own food
for years with no ill effect.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.254
Nonetheless, I would
strongly urge you to refrain...

33:27.422 --> 33:30.966
...from eating or drinking anything
until we can run some tests.

33:35.263 --> 33:41.185
I accept your concern in the spirit of
generosity with which I know you offer it.

33:48.860 --> 33:53.030
There's still the matter
of who killed Leila, our acquaintance.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.949
Any ideas?

33:55.117 --> 33:56.992
I told you, it's dangerous outside.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.829
Yeah, but we think it was
more of a two-legged danger.

33:59.996 --> 34:04.041
Probably more than one. Are there any
other people on this island of yours?

34:08.004 --> 34:10.172
I'll have Anne prepare rooms for you.

34:10.799 --> 34:14.927
Sleep in peace, all of you,
as our guests.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.888
We'll talk in the morning.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.901
What the hell was that?

34:31.111 --> 34:33.529
That was the head of a cult.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.406
Keep your voice down.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.410
I got a feeling he's not the only one
who likes to eavesdrop around here.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.204
What do we do?

34:42.372 --> 34:44.290
We get some sleep.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.835
And tomorrow we figure out
what the hell we've stumbled into.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.015
Thank you.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.435
-For what?
-Not killing me.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.359
It smells good.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.124
Tastes good too.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.175
I'm looking for someone.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.178
I wonder if you could help me.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.600
Point me in the right direction?

35:47.062 --> 35:49.396
I'm looking for a man
named Alan Farragut.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.612
What? You know him?

35:58.532 --> 36:00.699
Is he here on the island?

36:01.910 --> 36:02.952
He's here.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.080
Can you take me to him?

36:06.248 --> 36:08.207
Please, I have to see him.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.875
I can.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.794
But you may not like what you find.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.081
Thank you.
