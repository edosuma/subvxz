I didn't see any
for Ritter in there.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.348
- Ritter.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.089
Oh, you mean the candidate.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.091
Yeah, he's a no-go.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.006
- What, he--he's not coming
to the picnic?

21:52.049 --> 21:53.442
- Not with our company,
he's not.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.923
He's a decent kid
but, I mean, you saw him

21:55.966 --> 21:57.141
in that tower fire.

21:57.185 --> 21:58.578
He totally froze up.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.971
I had to kick him back
to the floater pool.

22:01.015 --> 22:04.018
- Yeah, no, sure.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.280
- Thanks for these.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.022
Catch you at the picnic?
- You bet.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.422
I'm looking for
a Lieutenant Severide.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.032
Is this the right house?
- You found him.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.338
- Sean Morland.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.165
I represent Ms. Amy Whittaker

22:21.209 --> 22:23.080
in her divorce.

22:23.124 --> 22:24.691
- The department can give you
my report.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.476
- Yeah, official reports,
they're dry.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.957
I'm interested in
the human perspective.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.872
Is this okay?

22:31.915 --> 22:34.396
Now, am I correct, Lieutenant,
that Mr. Whittaker

22:34.440 --> 22:36.398
made no attempt
to rescue his son

22:36.442 --> 22:38.487
prior to your arrival?

22:38.531 --> 22:40.750
- He was barely conscious.
- Oh, sure, but I'm sure

22:40.794 --> 22:42.404
that at the moment you arrived
he told you

22:42.448 --> 22:45.364
Mason was in the car, right?
- Not exactly.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.105
He was asking where Mason was.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.803
Like, he didn't know?

22:49.846 --> 22:51.500
That's odd, right?

22:51.544 --> 22:53.720
- Not considering the extent
of his injuries.

vehicular suicides before

22:56.375 --> 22:57.941
in your line of work,
Lieutenant?

22:57.985 --> 22:59.465
- I have.
- Yeah, so it wouldn't be

22:59.508 --> 23:01.728
an unusual phenomenon
for someone with a history

23:01.771 --> 23:03.512

going on in someone's head.
