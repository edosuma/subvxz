WEBVTT

00:04.265 --> 00:05.831
Eight of hearts.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.268
Drink!

00:11.272 --> 00:12.273
Three of clubs.

00:12.316 --> 00:15.015
- Drink!
- Drink!

00:15.058 --> 00:17.321
I forget, which cards
don't we drink on?

00:17.365 --> 00:18.690
Don't worry, I took them
out of the deck.

00:18.714 --> 00:24.067
Francine!

00:24.111 --> 00:24.763
Chicago Dave!

00:24.807 --> 00:25.982
That's Chicago Dave!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.462
My buddy from college!

00:27.505 --> 00:29.551
He's ascended the mountain,
Francine!

00:29.594 --> 00:30.726
A real mountain?

00:30.769 --> 00:32.249
Like Mount Everlast?

00:32.293 --> 00:34.164
Or Mount Killamandingo?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.426
What? No.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.689
He's writing movies
for Reese Witherspoon!

00:37.733 --> 00:40.692
<i>What's the best part of writing
a movie for Reese Witherspoon?</i>

00:40.736 --> 00:42.738
<i>Easy.
Meeting Reese Witherspoon.</i>

00:42.781 --> 00:44.696
<i>Obviously. I'm so embarrassed
I even asked.</i>

00:44.740 --> 00:46.394
Dave moved to Chicago.

00:46.437 --> 00:49.266
Joined the world-famous
City Second improv troupe

00:49.310 --> 00:50.750
where he was plucked
to join the cast

00:50.789 --> 00:52.182
of <i>Sketches and Laughing,</i>

00:52.226 --> 00:54.054
a.k.a. <i>S-and-L!</i>

00:54.097 --> 00:56.186
And now he's writing
Reese Witherspoon movies.

00:56.230 --> 00:57.753
What's your point, Stan?

00:57.796 --> 01:00.016
My point is that man
could have been me.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.583
I flipped another card!

01:03.628 --> 01:06.109
Great, I'm missing
the end of the game.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.415
It's a red one!

01:07.458 --> 01:10.113
Ugh, that's a drink one, Stan.

01:42.754 --> 01:46.280
Chicago Dave is living
the best life a human can.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.325
And you went to college
with him.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.240
I more than went to college
with him.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.459
A little backstory is needed.

01:51.502 --> 01:52.764
Ugh.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.376
It was the summer
of 21 years ago...

01:55.419 --> 01:58.161
the start of my senior year
of college.

01:58.205 --> 02:01.164
I was ready to take the throne
as Funniest Student

02:01.208 --> 02:02.470
in the School of Government.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.385
But what I didn't know
was someone else

02:04.428 --> 02:06.387
had eyes on the same prize.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.998
What are two examples
of a Republic?

02:09.041 --> 02:10.695
Uh, Disneyland and Narnia.

02:12.044 --> 02:14.351
Uh, my butt and balls.

02:14.395 --> 02:17.267
Okay, shut up, shut up!

02:17.311 --> 02:19.095
We're trying to learn
government here!

02:21.445 --> 02:22.838
We became a team.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.449
By winter break we were known
more for our comedy

02:25.493 --> 02:28.017
than our schoolwork,
which we had stopped doing.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.193
...which led to rules
governing search and seizure...

02:30.237 --> 02:32.021
Seizure?
I barely know her!

02:32.064 --> 02:34.023
Checks and balances?

02:34.066 --> 02:36.330
More like cheeks and ball-ances!

02:37.461 --> 02:39.942
I didn't even say checks
and balances!

02:43.293 --> 02:46.949
Promise me you will never accept
any sort of government job.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.864
And do what instead?

02:48.907 --> 02:50.648
- Comedy?
- Sure.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.129
I despise comedy,
so that would be great.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.262
Except for Mark Russell,
the political pianist.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.829
You guys familiar?

02:57.873 --> 02:59.396
What do you say, Stan?

02:59.440 --> 03:03.052
Ya wanna move to Chicago
and chase this dragon?

03:03.095 --> 03:06.403
<i>RUSSELL: ♪ Ross Perot,

03:08.275 --> 03:10.494

03:10.538 --> 03:13.193
There was only one problem.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.455
I can't go.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.978
I'm too afraid.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.241
Come on, Stan.
I can't go alone.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.374
I need someone to talk to
on the drive.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.984
Oh, wait.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.207
Never mind! Bye!

03:27.250 --> 03:29.731
Have fun living a life of fear!

03:31.863 --> 03:33.735
He moved to Chicago without me.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.911
Never talked to him again.
Tried to get in touch,

03:35.954 --> 03:38.653
but who can touch
a shooting star?

03:38.696 --> 03:41.003
You can't even touch
a regular star, Stan.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.309
They're suns.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.224
If I'd just gotten
in that Fiero,

03:44.267 --> 03:45.747
I'd be a famous comedian.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.446
What? How?

03:49.490 --> 03:51.492
- You're not funny.
- Tha... bha...

03:51.535 --> 03:52.406
tha... bha...

03:52.449 --> 03:53.755
I'm a funny guy!

03:53.798 --> 03:55.322
That's what I identify as.

03:55.365 --> 03:58.368
Stan Smith...
Funny. Guy.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.370
I honestly don't know

04:00.414 --> 04:02.329
if you're joking right now.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.244
It's always so hard
to tell with you.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.246
Are you being crazy right now?

04:06.289 --> 04:07.769
Kids!

04:10.989 --> 04:12.295
Not you, Klaus.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.778
Your Dad just said
he's a funny guy.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.695
That's a funny thing
to say, Dad.

04:20.738 --> 04:21.957
That's not like you.

04:22.000 --> 04:22.914
It wasn't a joke!

04:22.958 --> 04:24.089
Here's a joke...

04:24.133 --> 04:25.308
have you seen these teens

04:25.352 --> 04:27.049
eating their Tide Pods?

04:27.092 --> 04:29.138
What the heck?
Those are for dishwashers.

04:29.181 --> 04:30.400
Boo.

04:30.444 --> 04:33.447
Stan, the last good joke
you made was Steve!

04:33.490 --> 04:36.363
Nice, Mom!
You burned Dad <i>and</i> Steve.

04:36.406 --> 04:39.104
Unlike Dad,
who's had 14 years to burn me

04:39.148 --> 04:40.280
and never once scored.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.673
Never once scored...

04:42.717 --> 04:43.892
kinda like Steve!

04:43.935 --> 04:45.850
Oh, ho! Wow!

04:45.894 --> 04:47.287
You see that, Dad?

04:47.330 --> 04:49.332
That's how you roast Steve.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.643
What the hell, Stan?

04:55.686 --> 04:57.471
I'm out.
Moving to Chicago.

04:57.514 --> 04:58.994
Gonna prove the haters wrong.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.517
What about work?

05:00.561 --> 05:02.084
I told Bullock that when
I was young,

05:02.127 --> 05:04.826
I dreamt of being a comedian
and how I chickened out.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.654
He instantly granted me
Regret Leave,

05:06.697 --> 05:08.699
which was a surprise considering

05:08.743 --> 05:10.179
we're basically
getting ass-slammed

05:10.222 --> 05:11.659
by China round the clock.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.661
Why don't you just take
an improv class

05:13.704 --> 05:15.184
at the Learning Attic?

05:15.227 --> 05:16.901
Why would I listen to anything
you have to say?

05:16.925 --> 05:18.405
You're my number-one hater.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.058
You've never supported
my comedy.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.365
Come on, is this real?

05:22.409 --> 05:23.689
How long do you plan to be gone?

05:23.714 --> 05:25.542
As long as it takes.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.239
Maybe even longer.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.418
Goodbye, Francine.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.854

06:16.593 --> 06:18.116
- Klaus?!
- Klaus!

06:18.160 --> 06:19.944
Baaa-haaaa!

06:19.988 --> 06:23.208
You didn't think I'd let you
move to Chi-Town solo, did you?

06:23.252 --> 06:25.863
Plus, my boy Courtney
in Tampa's cousin, Lindsey,

06:25.907 --> 06:29.171
lives down in Champaign
and has a super-tight posse.

06:29.214 --> 06:31.062
He said we can go down there
or they can come up here.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.175
It's all good, Stan.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.829
No, no. No distractions.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.048
I'm here to focus
on my comedy career.

06:37.092 --> 06:40.182
Tomorrow is my first day
at City Second Improv.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.531
Don't worry, Stan.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.968
My boys won't get in the way.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.841
We're just gonna be joshing
around, teasing each other,

06:46.884 --> 06:49.278
sharing our dreams,
building our lives,

06:49.321 --> 06:52.586
and creating memories
that will last a lifetime.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.849
That's if they're willing
to drive up from Champaign,

06:54.892 --> 06:56.764
which they sounded
on the fence about.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.943
I'm gonna bury you guys
at improv.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.553
I wrote so much improv.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.947
I got a joke for every location.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.340
Bar, Mission Control,
Grocery Store,

07:08.384 --> 07:09.690
another Mission Control.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.126
Restaurant?

07:11.169 --> 07:12.320
No one's gonna say "restaurant"!

07:12.344 --> 07:13.476
No one's gonna say that!

07:13.520 --> 07:15.478
Welcome to Improv Level One!

07:15.522 --> 07:17.480
After tonight,
you'll see there's no limit

07:17.524 --> 07:19.830
to your comedy dreams
beyond the number of classes

07:19.874 --> 07:21.092
you can afford.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.877
So let's go!

07:24.400 --> 07:26.184
You must quit comedy
immediately.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.143
- I'm sorry?
- You were horrible.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.101
That thing where you kept
pulling your shirt

07:30.145 --> 07:31.973
over your head
and yelling incoherently?

07:32.016 --> 07:33.278
That's Turtle Man!

07:33.322 --> 07:34.932
A very funny character of mine!

07:34.976 --> 07:37.805
Look, I'm not supposed
to discourage anyone.

07:37.848 --> 07:40.111
This theater, like every other
comedy theater in America,

07:40.155 --> 07:42.810
is a pyramid scheme.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.508
There are plenty of jobs
outside of comedy.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.684
Have you ever considered
getting a government job?

07:47.728 --> 07:49.599
Actually I work at the C.I.A.

07:49.643 --> 07:52.210
That's pretty funny.

07:52.254 --> 07:55.083
But that's not a joke.
I <i>do</i> work at the C.I.A.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.650
Please leave at once.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.568
What happened?!

08:01.611 --> 08:03.023
My teacher kicked me
out of improv class

08:03.047 --> 08:04.396
after only eight minutes.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.659
Wow, that's fast.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.269
But it's only your
first setback.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.314
And my last. I'm quitting.

08:09.358 --> 08:12.404
But we haven't even had time
to hang with my Champaign Crew.

08:12.448 --> 08:16.147
Stan, this is Lindsey,
Double Dog, and Monty.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.082
Klaus, I don't want to meet
your disgusting friends.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.064
They all look like
Toomgis the Snack Monster.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.981
Holy crap,
this dude's hilarious.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.809
You shouldn't do improv.

08:25.853 --> 08:29.552
You should be
a famous stand-up comedian.

08:29.596 --> 08:30.771
I like these guys.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.773
Seem smart. Stan.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.209
Name's Stan.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.471
Stan Smith.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.693
Why aren't you guys ready?

08:39.736 --> 08:42.043
We're going on that
Deep Dish Pizza Crawl.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.914
Actually we're staying in
and helping

08:43.958 --> 08:45.849
- Stan with his comedy.
- Why would you want to hang out

08:45.873 --> 08:47.439
with these guys anyway, Klaus?

08:47.483 --> 08:49.050
They look like a bunch
of Toomgises.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.096
You said that one before, Stan!

08:52.140 --> 08:54.142
I'm recycling some of
the classic ones, Klaus.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.317
All the greats do it.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.188
Oh, here's a new joke
I thought of...

08:57.232 --> 08:58.886
Klaus got caught
sneaking a thermos

08:58.929 --> 09:00.583
into the movie theater
and he cried!

09:03.281 --> 09:04.761
Good one, Stan.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.502
Classic joke structure.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.592
I'm going to, uh, go throw
a whiz in the toilet.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.203
Francine.
You gotta come get Stan.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.336
He totally crashed and burned
trying to do comedy

09:14.379 --> 09:16.338
and he's too ashamed
to come home.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.340
<i>Are you not here?</i>

09:18.383 --> 09:20.255
What, no, I'm in Chicago!

09:20.298 --> 09:22.866
I left weeks ago,
when Stan left.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.781
<i>Huh.
Now what's this?</i>

09:24.825 --> 09:26.609
Stan's given up on comedy!

09:26.653 --> 09:29.438
He just sits on his ass all day
with these idiots,

09:29.481 --> 09:31.658
who are supposed to be
my friends, by the way.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.573
And if you ever want
your husband back,

09:33.616 --> 09:35.575
you got to come get him.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.624
So, have you been to
a deli lately?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.278
All this deli meat?

09:43.321 --> 09:47.412
I mean, who needs
this much deli meat?

09:47.456 --> 09:48.936
And that's how I close the show.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.683
Francine,
what are you doing here?

09:56.726 --> 09:58.772
- Klaus called me and...
- Klaus?!

09:58.815 --> 10:01.296
Klaus, you called Francine
to come get me?

10:01.339 --> 10:02.819
What? No, no.

10:02.863 --> 10:05.517
I only called her to
tell her you were doing great.

10:05.561 --> 10:06.867
And I didn't even call her!

10:06.910 --> 10:09.217
So you haven't given up, Stan?

10:09.260 --> 10:11.654
That's great news,
because I felt

10:11.698 --> 10:13.830
terrible about
not supporting you.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.876
Everybody felt terrible
about that.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.529
It was a dark day.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.227
Let me make it up to you.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.359
I want to get you out there.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.448
I'll book you gigs,
be your manager.

10:23.492 --> 10:26.103
Hmm. Would that be stepping
on your toes, Lindsey?

10:26.974 --> 10:29.803
Sorry, I guess my cousin
got in a car accident.

10:29.846 --> 10:30.978
What's going on, Stan?

10:31.021 --> 10:32.457
Hey, you focus on your thing.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.285
Francine's my manager now.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.592
Francine, as I become more
and more successful,

10:36.636 --> 10:38.986
your job will be getting me
roles in Pixar movies

10:39.029 --> 10:40.596
and defending me on Twitter.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.688
Surf's up, duders!

10:45.732 --> 10:47.429
Stan and Fran are gone.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.257
Time to live a little, guys!

10:49.300 --> 10:50.693
Cowabunga!

10:50.737 --> 10:52.695
Eungh. I'm droppin' in!

10:52.739 --> 10:54.479
Eungh. I'm gonna shoot this!

10:54.523 --> 10:56.090
Eungh.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.787
I'm stayin' upstairs tonight.

11:00.224 --> 11:03.663
Now, this is what the surf
community calls hanging loose.

11:05.708 --> 11:08.363
Honestly, Roger, we're tired
from "livin' a little"

11:08.406 --> 11:09.669
with you all the time.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.497
We're burned out
on all your schemes, heists,

11:12.541 --> 11:15.152
scams, set-ups, misadventures,
and dalliances.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.285
Hmm, I'm starting to think

11:17.328 --> 11:19.809
maybe you <i>did</i> steal
my thesaurus, Steve.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.943
It's just nice to chill
for a change, don't you think?

11:22.986 --> 11:26.424
No, what I do think is maybe you
guys need a change of scenery.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.730
And I heard there's a rager

11:27.774 --> 11:29.645
down at Chimdale Harbor.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.388
Name's Dirt Mirklegunk
and I know how to rock!

11:35.216 --> 11:36.608
No! No! Stop that.

11:36.652 --> 11:37.958
Hard pass!

11:38.001 --> 11:40.612
Ugh, that is <i>super</i> annoying!

11:40.656 --> 11:42.397
- You're annoying!
- You know what, Roger?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.268
Maybe <i>you</i> need a little break

11:44.312 --> 11:46.140
from "livin' a little"
all the time.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.011
You think so?

11:48.055 --> 11:49.665
- I don't know.
- Tell you what,

11:49.709 --> 11:52.059
why don't you
let Hayley and me host you

11:52.102 --> 11:53.974
for a chill night in?

11:54.017 --> 11:56.890
Hmm, and if that sucks,
then we can go live a little?

11:56.933 --> 11:58.195
- Maybe.
- Cool, cool.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.477
By the way, I'm changing my name

11:59.501 --> 12:02.896
from Dirt Murkledunk
to Mirt Dirkledunk.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.115
What's up with electric cars?

12:05.159 --> 12:06.900
Is everything gonna be electric?

12:06.943 --> 12:09.554
What's next? Electric slide?

12:09.598 --> 12:11.774
I prefer my slide to be
gas-powered,

12:11.818 --> 12:13.863
thank you very much.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.474
Hmm. No, that's perfect.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.607
Stan, I got you a gig!

12:18.650 --> 12:21.044
There's a show
at Pizzeria Uno tonight

12:21.088 --> 12:23.003
and they had a comedian cancel.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.569
Tonight?
I'd better practice

12:24.613 --> 12:27.747
my funny faces in the mirror!

12:27.790 --> 12:29.836
Your boy's gonna bomb, Francine.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.794
That'd be sad.

12:31.838 --> 12:35.189
Then we'd have to go home
where I get to have all the sex

12:35.232 --> 12:36.538
I want with him.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.758
And where the snacks and TV are.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.281
You <i>want</i> him to bomb!

12:40.324 --> 12:41.325
Yes, Klaus.

12:41.369 --> 12:44.198
You're bad, Francine.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.678
You're a bad lady.

12:49.638 --> 12:53.120
Hey! Welcome, everybody,
to Pizzeria Uno's comedy night,

12:53.163 --> 12:54.643
<i>Take My Slice, Cheese.</i>

12:54.686 --> 12:56.297
Okay.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.995
Our first comedian is some guy.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.737
Let's give it up for him, huh?

13:03.478 --> 13:05.132
Whoo!

13:05.175 --> 13:09.310
Please.
"Some Guy" is my father's name.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.399
So, millennials.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.140
Don't you just wish
they were all dead?

13:14.881 --> 13:17.231
But then who would be
left to play Porkymons?

13:17.274 --> 13:19.537
Boo!

13:19.581 --> 13:21.452
Screw you,
let's see you get up here!

13:21.496 --> 13:23.628
I will as soon as
the ambulance arrives.

13:23.672 --> 13:24.847
Oh, no.
Is something wrong?

13:24.891 --> 13:26.675
Yeah!
Someone's choking...

13:26.718 --> 13:28.329
on stage!

13:28.372 --> 13:29.939
This crowd stinks!

13:29.983 --> 13:31.375
Turtle Man out!

13:34.335 --> 13:35.771
Oh, come on!

13:35.815 --> 13:37.729
He knocked over my pitchers
of Blue Moon!

13:37.773 --> 13:39.296
Goddammit!

13:40.558 --> 13:42.169
Stan, are you okay?

13:42.212 --> 13:44.258
Those are the kinds of shows
that make you want

13:44.301 --> 13:45.781
to give up and move home.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.392
It's okay.
You gave it your all.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.307
But I'm <i>not</i> going home!
With your support,

13:50.351 --> 13:52.309
I can do this
for as long as it takes.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.310
Jigga-what?!

13:53.354 --> 13:54.921
You see, I don't want much.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.053
I just want to ascend
the mountain of comedy

13:57.097 --> 14:00.535
and stand atop it alone,
like a hero or a god.

14:00.578 --> 14:04.452
Or something bigger than a god,
a fireball... a firehorse!

14:04.495 --> 14:06.933
Anyone who comes near me
shall be burned.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.325
Is that so much to ask?

14:08.369 --> 14:10.066
I guess not.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.851
Whoo! Look out, world!

14:11.894 --> 14:13.504
Cat!

14:13.548 --> 14:14.592
Yeah, you better run!

14:14.636 --> 14:15.942
Uh-oh, Francine,

14:15.985 --> 14:17.595
looks like
your support backfired.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.381
You're right.
We're never going home.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.255
Smith!
The Chinese are trying to kill

14:25.299 --> 14:28.389
<i>S&L</i> cast member Colin Jokes.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.913
We need an agent on the inside.

14:30.957 --> 14:34.438
Please tell me you've become
a world-class comedian!

14:34.482 --> 14:36.179
<i>S&L?</i>

14:36.223 --> 14:38.007
That's the top of the mountain.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.704
We'd be done.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.097
He'll do it!

14:41.141 --> 14:42.055
You ready to get out of here?

14:42.098 --> 14:44.840
Stan! You got <i>S&L!</i>

14:44.884 --> 14:46.450
What? How?

14:46.494 --> 14:49.627
Uh, one of the busboys
was a scout

14:49.671 --> 14:51.151
and thought you were a genius.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.675
Yes! I made it to <i>S&L!</i>

14:53.718 --> 14:55.938
And I didn't have to deploy
my best character...

14:55.982 --> 14:58.288
Guy who
talks with a crazy voice!

15:01.291 --> 15:04.207
So Stan really thinks he's
funny enough to be on <i>S&L?</i>

15:04.251 --> 15:07.776
Yeah, and if he finds out
otherwise, it'll destroy him.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.996
So don't say anything
about this being a mission.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.364
But shouldn't he know
the Chinese are trying

15:11.388 --> 15:12.912
to kill Colin Jokes?

15:12.955 --> 15:14.957
Stan's a C.I.A. agent.

15:15.001 --> 15:18.308
If anything happens, his spy
instincts will take over.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.657
Well, he better not mess this up

15:19.701 --> 15:22.138
because I want to go
to the cast afterparty.

15:22.182 --> 15:23.618
I met a girl on Bumble
who claims

15:23.661 --> 15:26.403
she's second cousins
with Pete Davidson

15:26.447 --> 15:28.971
and I want to make sure
she's not a liar.

15:29.015 --> 15:32.540
One extra-hot
Cranberry Juice Cocktail.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.282
Aah!

15:35.325 --> 15:36.631
All right, I think I'm ready.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.198
There he is!

15:38.241 --> 15:40.026
<i>S&L</i> Creator
and Executive Producer

15:40.069 --> 15:41.810
Lorne Mykies!

15:41.853 --> 15:45.770
Stan, I just wanted
to personally thank you.

15:45.814 --> 15:49.122
It's good to know Colin's
going to be safe out there.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.601
He'll be safe, all right.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.908
Safe in a blanket
of warm laughter.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.866
It's wild.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.651
All this just because
we made a couple jokes

15:56.694 --> 15:58.566
about the Chinese government.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.350
I've got some pretty good
Chinese jokes

16:00.394 --> 16:02.004
that aren't
about the government.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.088
Don't worry, I'll only break
'em out if we need 'em.

16:05.181 --> 16:08.315
The C.I.A.
told me you were funny.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.970
Hmm. What do you think
he meant by "the C.I.A.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.232
told me you were funny"?

16:12.275 --> 16:13.973
Who knows?
That guy's a weirdo!

16:14.016 --> 16:17.889
All you have to do now is relax
and read the cue cards.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.675
Remember, <i>S&L</i> has the funniest
writers in the world.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.503
They do now that I'm here.

16:22.546 --> 16:25.462
That's why I rewrote all the cue
cards with my own punchlines.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.724
What?!

16:26.768 --> 16:28.465
What pen did you use?

16:28.509 --> 16:30.424
And what end did you hold?

16:33.079 --> 16:34.994
Don't want to live a little,
huh?

16:35.037 --> 16:36.604
Well, this is the other way
to go.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.699
Damn, what's in this shit?

16:44.742 --> 16:47.093
Rum & Cokes!
Get your rum & Cokes!

16:47.136 --> 16:48.442
I can't drink rum.

16:48.485 --> 16:49.791
Yours doesn't have rum in it.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.923
- Which one's mine?
- Any one without the "X."

16:51.967 --> 16:53.882
So it's movie night
and we're stayin' in.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.840
Love it.

16:55.884 --> 16:59.844
Tonight's entertainment
is 2017's <i>The Beguiled,</i>

16:59.888 --> 17:02.064
about an injured
Union soldier in the South

17:02.108 --> 17:03.892
that comes upon a school
full of women.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.025
Fair warning...
whenever I watch a movie,

17:06.068 --> 17:08.679
I can't resist making
hilarious little comments.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.642
Beguiled?
More like buh...

17:14.685 --> 17:17.079
buh-bullshiiiiiit.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.863
Heh heh heh.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.130
You can't start <i>Week In Updates!</i>

17:24.173 --> 17:26.610
Oh, no, it started.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.309
And I totally would have
stopped it for you.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.008
Hello. I'm Colin Jokes.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.444
And I'm Stan Smith.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.359
And this is <i>Week In Updates.</i>

17:36.403 --> 17:38.666
Honey! Langley Stan!

17:38.709 --> 17:40.798
My buddy from college!
He's done it!

17:40.842 --> 17:43.627
He's ascended the mountain!

17:43.671 --> 17:46.500
Oh, sorry.
Didn't see you'd fallen asleep.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.502
The city of Philadelphia
had quite a mess

17:48.545 --> 17:50.025
on its hands this week

17:50.069 --> 17:52.506
when 80 cows got loose
on the freeway.

17:52.549 --> 17:55.291
When reached for comment,
the Mayor of Philadelphia said,

17:55.335 --> 17:56.684
"Millennials?

17:56.727 --> 18:00.775
Don't you wish
they were all dead?"

18:00.818 --> 18:03.386
But then who would eat
all the avacordo torst?

18:04.996 --> 18:07.999
Tough crowd.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.567
Oh, no, Turtle Man.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.743
Wait, look at Colin Jokes' hand.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.658
A bomb detonator!

18:14.702 --> 18:16.573
Colin Jokes isn't the target.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.140
He's the attacker!

18:18.184 --> 18:19.794
But Stan can't see!

18:19.837 --> 18:21.752
His spy instincts won't kick in!

18:21.796 --> 18:24.277
We've got to do something!

18:28.585 --> 18:29.978
They love me.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.371
Riiiight.

18:31.414 --> 18:32.850
Spy instincts!

18:33.764 --> 18:35.549
Aah!

18:52.914 --> 18:56.613
I've heard of a comedian
bombing, but this is ridiculous.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.928
Wow, pretty good for a movie
with no dinosaurs,

19:06.971 --> 19:08.799
don't ya think?

19:08.843 --> 19:12.151
Sleepy heads countin' sheep.
Don't worry.

19:12.194 --> 19:15.066
Uncle Roger'll clean up
all the cups and poison.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.199
The poison!
To the hospital!

19:25.164 --> 19:27.470
Did they find
the real Colin Jokes?

19:27.514 --> 19:29.733
He was tied up
in his dressing room.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.300
Turns out the Chinese were only

19:31.344 --> 19:34.216
after tonight's
musical guest, Pitbull.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.566
I guess China's President is
in a legal battle

19:36.610 --> 19:39.569
with him
over the title of Mr. Worldwide.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.658
I should really get on the horn
with Beijing,

19:41.702 --> 19:44.095
see if I can smooth things over.

19:44.139 --> 19:47.795
Stan, I want to thank you again
for saving the show.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.928
You got it.
Anything for the almighty laugh.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.372
And you know what
the weird part is?

19:52.408 --> 19:54.280
It felt just like being
on a mission.

19:54.323 --> 19:55.672
I'm normally a C.I.A. agent.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.284
Haha! That's funny.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.503
You're funny.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.113
You hear that, Francine?

20:02.157 --> 20:04.290
Lorne Mykies said I was funny.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.466
How's the view from the top
of the mountain?

20:06.509 --> 20:07.989
Majestic.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.209
But you know, the most fun I had

20:10.252 --> 20:11.819
out there
was disarming that bomb

20:11.862 --> 20:13.864
and beating that man to a pulp.

20:13.908 --> 20:16.563
Maybe it's time to go back home
and work at the C.I.A. again.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.739
That sounds wonderful, Stan.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.436
Now let's get home.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.222
Feels like I haven't seen
Toshi and the gang in forever.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.923
Wh-What happened?

20:28.966 --> 20:30.403
Why are we in the hospital?

20:30.446 --> 20:31.708
No one knows.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.536
Doctors aren't ruling out
poison, though.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.625
And the tests all say
that's definitely what it was.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.410
Which is probably why...

20:37.453 --> 20:40.891
the boys in blue
have been contacted.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.025
So I gotta mosey.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.331
The important thing?

20:45.374 --> 20:46.767
Remember to live a little,
right?

20:46.810 --> 20:48.682
Can't thumb your nose at life.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.035
Rope was too long!

20:54.078 --> 20:56.603
And not tied to anything?!

20:56.646 --> 20:58.300
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
