day of a national power outage

09:21.765 --> 09:24.182
or a slight tsunami.

09:25.770 --> 09:28.186
What about you, Abby?
How do you find the drama?

09:28.238 --> 09:30.939
Oh, my drama is homegrown, locally sourced,

09:30.991 --> 09:33.418
and sustainable, because it never ends.

09:33.419 --> 09:34.556
[laughter]

09:34.557 --> 09:38.208

thing at the wrong time, which people love.

09:44.837 --> 09:47.160
All righty, questions from the room?

09:47.324 --> 09:48.524
Yes?

09:49.608 --> 09:52.403
For Ms. McCarthy, how do you stay so thin?

09:52.404 --> 09:54.416
Is it the divorce diet?

09:54.715 --> 10:01.017
Um, some women do seem to shed
pounds when they get divorced.

10:01.018 --> 10:04.007
Maybe it's carrying the heavy weight

10:04.008 --> 10:06.635

helps you burn more calories.

10:16.620 --> 10:18.479
Um, I follow you two on Twitter,

10:18.480 --> 10:20.935

10:20.936 --> 10:24.310
Now, was that fiction or non?

10:26.163 --> 10:28.103
Ah, we've had a few professional dinners.

10:28.104 --> 10:30.248
It's really nothing
really to text home about.

- Hey!

10:42.000 --> 10:43.348
Yo, what's eating you?

10:43.847 --> 10:45.680
Aside from the face lice.

10:45.681 --> 10:49.253

is in New York and never answers her phone.

10:49.254 --> 10:50.149
Everything okay?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.604
No, but you're not the

- Whatever.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.059
- begin and end with you two. I'm sorry.
- Okay, but the kids... The kids

11:13.060 --> 11:16.585

it's not exactly the way I wanted to have

11:16.586 --> 11:19.014

Don't be a pussy.

11:25.488 --> 11:28.024
You know, when I grew up in the
Bronx, we didn't have all these,

11:28.025 --> 11:29.307
"Oh, no, I dropped my FroYo" problems.

11:29.309 --> 11:32.347
We had real problems like no
medical and... and government cheese,

11:32.348 --> 11:34.593
but my mother, she always
pointed out the bright side.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.814
Here's how you tell the kids:

11:35.866 --> 11:39.286
more people equals more love. It
might not be the way you planned it,

11:39.287 --> 11:42.167
but you always have to make
room in your hearts for the new.

11:42.866 --> 11:44.072
Could I be...

11:44.073 --> 11:45.727

- Well, what do you mean?

11:48.495 --> 11:50.161

- Oh, she's the worst.

- Oh, no!

and have lunch at the club.

12:01.260 --> 12:03.308
Screw that blended family shit.

12:03.309 --> 12:05.673
- I'm not blending in for anyone.

12:05.674 --> 12:07.972
Charlene's in your life and in Zooey's,

12:07.973 --> 12:09.961
so you don't be a pussy.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.495
Go have lunch at the club,
and I will have the talk,

12:12.496 --> 12:14.352
if I can ever get in touch with Abby.

12:18.214 --> 12:19.414
Hey, Albert?

12:19.422 --> 12:20.626
Hi.

12:21.027 --> 12:24.195
Um, can I borrow you for a sec?

12:24.197 --> 12:26.443
- Always.
- Okay.

12:26.783 --> 12:28.645
Ready to crush it in court tomorrow?

12:28.646 --> 12:30.069
Not exactly.

12:30.070 --> 12:33.806
I, uh, would like to
remove myself from the case.

12:37.377 --> 12:39.387
Um, the depositions are in order.

12:39.388 --> 12:41.771
Paul and Dan have pulled
together a ton of precedent.

12:41.772 --> 12:44.580
They can argue this as well as me.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.740
That's actually not true.

I'm not a cheater.

12:55.778 --> 12:57.183
I don't know how I let it happen.

12:57.184 --> 12:59.684
Hey, don't feel so guilty.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.700
When you've worked
together as long as we have,

13:02.701 --> 13:07.053
you can sometimes develop
a... unexpected connection.

13:10.210 --> 13:11.620
Delia, it was a first offense.

13:11.621 --> 13:13.508
I think we can let
ourselves off with a warning.

13:14.078 --> 13:15.278
Okay.

Really hope Gordon can be as understanding.

- Yeah, I'm gonna tell him tonight.

What? I'm not on board with that.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.134
Well, I'm not gonna mention any names,

13:24.731 --> 13:27.392

Welcome to Gender Now!

13:31.063 --> 13:32.398
I'm Professor Harper,

13:32.399 --> 13:35.934
and we're gonna kick
things off with a pop quiz.

13:35.986 --> 13:38.686
[students groaning, mumbling]

13:38.738 --> 13:41.393
Now, the quiz is only one question:

13:41.394 --> 13:43.692
"Do you consider yourself a feminist?"

13:43.944 --> 13:45.500
Show of hands, feminists.

13:49.449 --> 13:51.989
You, please state why.

13:52.752 --> 13:55.169
I believe in a woman's right to equality.

13:55.205 --> 13:57.505
- [groans]
- [scattered chuckles]

13:57.541 --> 14:00.011
As a member of the LGBTQA community,

14:00.012 --> 14:01.350
I cannot support feminism

14:01.351 --> 14:03.515
as long as they continue
to use the word "vagina."

14:03.516 --> 14:04.878
What's wrong with the word vagina?

14:04.879 --> 14:07.160
It's exclusionary to the trans community

14:07.161 --> 14:09.604
and offers an extremely
narrow view on womanhood.

14:09.605 --> 14:13.343
The correct terminology is "front
hole" or "internal genitalia."

14:13.344 --> 14:14.748
Correct to... to who?

14:14.749 --> 14:17.681
The Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans
Questioning Allied community.

14:17.682 --> 14:18.931
The "Q" is for queer?

14:18.932 --> 14:20.732
If you insist on using the word vagina,

14:20.733 --> 14:22.411
- But you need to have a vagina to get
- you're labeling yourself a TERF.

14:22.412 --> 14:24.063
- pregnant or have an abortion.
- You're clinging to a binary

14:24.064 --> 14:25.692
view of gender. That's just old.

14:25.693 --> 14:27.174
- Says who?
- Okay, okay,

14:27.175 --> 14:29.176
I'm sure we can all see that feminism

14:29.177 --> 14:33.159
is a term deeply rooted
in historical, racial,

14:33.160 --> 14:34.751
and sexual perspectives.

14:34.752 --> 14:36.998
Our goal in this class

14:36.999 --> 14:40.192
is to strip the word of
all of its charged language,

14:40.193 --> 14:42.643
embark on a new dialectic,

14:42.802 --> 14:45.444
and to that end, your
first homework assignment

14:45.445 --> 14:48.057
will be a self-examination,

that I'm sorry that the panel

15:05.680 --> 15:07.660

15:07.661 --> 15:08.941
Yeah, it's not my comfort zone.

15:08.942 --> 15:12.034
Yeah, well, it might have
been a little less weird

15:12.035 --> 15:13.292
if you had talked to me about

15:13.293 --> 15:14.999
our nonexistent relationship status

15:15.000 --> 15:16.993

the rest of the world.

15:17.651 --> 15:20.706
Abby, basically, from when
we last saw each other,

15:20.708 --> 15:23.228
I thought it was pretty clear
that we're not on the same page.

house after the prom.

15:25.261 --> 15:27.075

15:27.504 --> 15:31.049
Very stalkery. Just...
I messed up. I blew it.

forgive me one mistake.

[Sherry giggling]

40:10.878 --> 40:14.051
It's really sweet of you
to bring dinner for Albert.

40:15.263 --> 40:17.303
Yeah, it's the closest
thing we get to date night.

40:19.098 --> 40:21.098
- So see you in court mañana?
- You bet.

40:21.100 --> 40:24.461
I'm gonna get... touched
up on those briefs.

- Hey.
- Hey.

40:36.936 --> 40:38.716
I know I was... I was
supposed to keep them tonight,

40:38.717 --> 40:40.715
but I... I have a-a call in the morning

40:40.716 --> 40:43.587
with my DP who's in rehab,
and I haven't done shit for it.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.495
And then I saw the TMZ thing,

40:46.496 --> 40:49.463
and I-I just fed them peanut
butter and crackers for dinner,

40:49.464 --> 40:52.065
and then I lost the will to
live, and we're out of milk.

40:53.006 --> 40:54.392
It's okay.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.366
Really?

40:56.367 --> 40:57.567
Mom?

40:57.853 --> 41:00.308
- Hi, honey.
- Charlie wet your bed.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.072
- What? He hasn't done that in years.
- Oh.

41:03.073 --> 41:05.442
I think he's probably regressing
because of the baby news.

41:05.443 --> 41:07.475
I'll... you do this.
I'll change the sheets.

41:07.651 --> 41:09.276
Just... could you? Thank you.

41:09.538 --> 41:11.579
No, I got it. I got it.

41:12.161 --> 41:15.245
Go home. And look in the mirror.

41:15.246 --> 41:16.638
It's all Ozark-y.

41:16.639 --> 41:18.638
It's like you're ready
to pitch for the Dodgers.

41:23.474 --> 41:24.674
Hey.

41:25.019 --> 41:26.219
Hey.

41:28.334 --> 41:32.053
Sorry about all the penises and vaginas.

41:32.054 --> 41:34.387
I think it made things worse for Charlie.

41:34.473 --> 41:37.898
It was a stressful situation,
and sometimes we blow it.

41:38.104 --> 41:39.491
It happens.

41:41.917 --> 41:43.438
Why didn't you go home with your dad?

41:43.439 --> 41:46.054
I wanted to stay with Charlie
and help him feel like things

41:46.055 --> 41:49.931
are more normal, and I guess for you too.

41:51.073 --> 41:52.299
For me?

41:52.941 --> 41:55.283
Yeah, I mean, are you okay with all this?

41:57.202 --> 41:58.485
I don't know.

42:00.739 --> 42:01.939
[chuckles]

42:02.296 --> 42:03.528
Are you?

42:03.822 --> 42:06.389
Yeah, I think it'll be kind
of cool having a pet baby.

42:07.585 --> 42:09.095
You are insane.

42:09.856 --> 42:12.291
Come on, Mom. It's Becca Riley's
baby. It's gonna be so cute.

42:12.292 --> 42:14.190
It's gonna be, like, Tumblr cute.

You're Tumblr cute. Come here, sweet girl.
