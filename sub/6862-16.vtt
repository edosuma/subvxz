WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:02.936
Those feelings I had
for Lavon...

00:02.969 --> 00:03.737
Something already happened
between you two, hasn't it?

00:03.771 --> 00:06.640
I have apologized,
again and again.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.376
What more do you want?
We share a business.

00:08.409 --> 00:09.377
I don't think
that we should anymore.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.744
I want to
dissolve AnnaBeth's.

00:10.778 --> 00:11.745
Plans for your bar?

00:11.779 --> 00:13.747
I think I might be ready
to give it another shot.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.349
When we win
the Battle of the Bands...

00:15.383 --> 00:16.784
We'll be $20,000 richer.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.752
Ta-da!

00:18.786 --> 00:21.089
I support you reaching
for your dream.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.591
I know that you will
 win tonight.

00:23.624 --> 00:24.492
So, you lost.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.759
There's plenty
of other ways

00:25.793 --> 00:27.095
that you can raise
money for your bar.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.496
You mean plenty
of ways to fail.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.498
Wade.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.348
Yo, Wade.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.118
I'm sorry
I missed you last night.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.385
I brought you breakfast.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.355
Wade?

00:57.725 --> 00:58.692
Ooh.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.861
Burt Reynolds.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.096
You seen Wade?

01:03.597 --> 01:05.166
Right.

01:05.199 --> 01:08.236
Got you your usual:
extra bacon, hold the cheese.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.073
Nice.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.846
Hey, have you guys
seen Wade?

01:18.879 --> 01:20.881
He's not at his place,
he's not at Lavon's.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.483
Seen Wade?

01:22.516 --> 01:24.785
Have... we seen... today...
have we seen...? No.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.454
Well, he didn't
come home last night.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.221
And he hasn't called.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.322
He could be
in a ditch somewhere.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.624
I put so much pressure on him
to win that contest,

01:30.658 --> 01:32.526
and then I didn't make it
to see his band play,

01:32.560 --> 01:33.527
and I think he's mad.

01:33.561 --> 01:34.862
Where is he?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.798
He's probably just at Meatball's
nursing his wounds.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.400
Yeah, you know,
that's probably it.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.868
Are you gonna eat
those pancakes?

01:40.901 --> 01:41.802
Yes!

01:41.835 --> 01:43.437
How about your waffle?

01:43.471 --> 01:44.738
Have them.
Have all of them.

01:44.772 --> 01:45.873
For no reason.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.608
I was done with those.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.410
Thanks, 'cause I just--
I get hungry, you know,

01:49.443 --> 01:50.478
when I'm worried.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.745
(mouth full):
Don't look at me.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.680
Oh.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.148
(clears throat)

01:55.949 --> 01:57.618
AnnaBeth, as
we discussed,

01:57.651 --> 01:58.486
here are the papers

01:58.519 --> 01:59.820
to officially dissolve
our business.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.723
Uh, Lemon, are-are you certain?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.558
I don't see that we have
any other choice.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.559
ANNABETH:
Lemon, come on.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.727
I really think we can

02:06.760 --> 02:08.729
work this out.
I don't think that we can.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.930
Listen, I'm sorry.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.466
It's not you, okay, it's me.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.634
Well, I mean,
it's partly you.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.869
I think that you remember
the part that was you, so...

02:18.772 --> 02:19.840
Fine.

02:24.745 --> 02:25.713
(bell clangs)

02:25.746 --> 02:26.914
All right.
(clears throat)

02:26.947 --> 02:28.649
That was a little louder
than I intended.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.352
Uh, my lovely niece Wanda

02:31.385 --> 02:35.889
and her new fiancÃ©, Tom Law,
have an announcement.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.795
Tom and I decided,
why wait?

02:41.829 --> 02:44.432
We're having our wedding
right here in two days.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.633
You're all invited!

02:45.666 --> 02:46.767
(shrieks)

02:49.337 --> 02:52.240
Am I the only one thinking
"too soon"?

02:52.273 --> 02:53.774
You got something.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.210
Syrup on your cheek.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.511
Where?
Where are...

02:59.547 --> 03:01.382
Have my napkin.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.950
Oh, won't that be fun?

03:02.983 --> 03:04.952
We haven't had
a wedding here since--

03:04.985 --> 03:06.287
Oops.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.958
LAVON:
 Mayor Gainey,

03:10.991 --> 03:13.427
thank you so much
for coming on by.

03:13.461 --> 03:17.231
Now, I-I know we've had, uh,
some difficulties in the past.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.165
Difficulties?

03:18.198 --> 03:19.867
Being awesomer than BlueBell
in every way

03:19.900 --> 03:21.569
has been easy for the citizens
of Fillmore.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.772
I wanted us to meet so that
we could, uh, talk things out

03:24.805 --> 03:25.973
in a friendly fashion.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.808
And what's there
to talk about exactly?

03:27.841 --> 03:29.677
Well, it's come to my attention
that you plan

03:29.710 --> 03:32.480
to build a shopping mall,
right next to our public beach.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.947
Yeah, I sure do.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.549
(chuckles)

03:35.583 --> 03:38.719
Perhaps you didn't consider
how it would affect us.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.788
See, there-there's
gonna be

03:40.821 --> 03:43.257
noise and pollution,
first from the construction,

03:43.291 --> 03:44.992
then made worse
from the traffic.

03:45.025 --> 03:48.396
This structure is
gonna be a boon in tourism

03:48.429 --> 03:49.430
for Fillmore, Hayes.

03:49.463 --> 03:53.334
If you ever had any visitors
over here in BlueBell,

03:53.367 --> 03:55.569
you'd understand that.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.704
Adios.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.911
Wade, what the hell?

04:03.944 --> 04:05.546
I really can't find you.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.881
How can you not call me
or text me

04:07.915 --> 04:09.450
or just scream loudly?

04:09.483 --> 04:11.485
Where are you?

04:11.519 --> 04:13.354
Thank goodness
you are here.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.688
I am itching all over,

04:14.722 --> 04:16.390
and it's driving
me batty.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.760
Are you gonna quarantine me
like you did to Tom

04:19.793 --> 04:21.028
when you thought he had leprosy?

04:21.060 --> 04:22.630
No, it just looks like
simple hives to me.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.698
It could be an allergic reaction
to something.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.635
Have you tried any
new medications or cosmetics,

04:27.668 --> 04:29.970
detergents,
cleaning solutions or foods?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.772
I don't really like new things.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.073
Well, hives are
often caused by

04:33.106 --> 04:35.376
the body's reaction to stress.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.378
Like, say,
the stress of trying to plan

04:37.411 --> 04:39.012
a whole wedding
in just two days.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.848
But getting married
right away is something

04:40.881 --> 04:42.683
Tom and I really
want to do.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.751
It's not stressful.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.018
Is it?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.019
How would I know?

04:46.053 --> 04:48.356
You are getting your boyfriend
to the altar.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.024
I can't even get mine
to return a phone call.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.960
(sighs)

04:54.362 --> 04:55.763
Wanda asked me to be
one of her bridesmaids.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.798
Not maid of honor,
but still, it's cool.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.533
I just hope she doesn't make me

04:59.567 --> 05:01.101
walk Tom's hamster
down the aisle.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.770
You know it's the flower girl?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.038
Hey, babe, I was thinking
that I should go have

05:05.072 --> 05:07.541
a little talk with Wade about
what happened the other night.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.910
George, we only saw him
leave the bar with that girl.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.679
We don't know what happened.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.381
And even if we did,

05:13.414 --> 05:14.548
it's none of our business.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.683
That-that is true.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.084
It's-it's true.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.820
You're gonna talk to him anyway,
aren't you?

05:19.853 --> 05:22.089
But on the bright side,
look how well you know me.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.957
George, I got
a problem.
Yeah?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.926
And, uh, since you're the
town lawyer, so do you.

05:25.959 --> 05:26.927
What's up?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.862
We have to take down
Todd Gainey.

05:28.896 --> 05:29.997
Todd Gainey Jr.,
my ex-boyfriend?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.799
Last time
we crossed paths with him,

05:31.832 --> 05:33.701
George shot himself in
the leg with a crossbow.

05:33.734 --> 05:34.902
Okay, the safety was off.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.670
No, no, senior,
not junior.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.705
The mayor of Fillmore.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.072
As far as I figure,

05:39.106 --> 05:41.409
the whole Gainey line's
got blood on its hands.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.576
George's blood.

05:43.611 --> 05:44.978
I'm in.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.914
Just tell me what you need.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.453
Honey, I realize from
the amount of cleaning products

05:52.486 --> 05:53.454
we just bought,

05:53.487 --> 05:56.724
going to this wedding
will be difficult for you.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.659
So, I think there's someone
you should talk to.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.462
I would never speak
to a therapist.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.130
Oh, heavens no.
I'm suggesting a psychic.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.898
Madam Van Horn

06:04.932 --> 06:07.000
is right down in Daphne,
and she is amazing.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.736
Correctly predicted that

06:08.769 --> 06:11.872
Marvin and Martha Goldstein's
grandbaby would be a boy.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.141
She had a 50% chance.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.009
Crickett, why on
God's green earth

06:16.043 --> 06:17.678
would I want to go see
a two-bit charlatan

06:17.711 --> 06:18.712
who wants to take my money,

06:18.746 --> 06:20.748
mess with my head
and who works out of a tent?

06:20.781 --> 06:22.550
Well, because this is the first
BlueBell wedding

06:22.583 --> 06:24.752
since your own... calamity.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.020
All eyes
will be on you.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.457
And in recent weeks,
you've lost your business,

06:29.490 --> 06:32.059
your best friend
and your dentist boyfriend.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.630
Besides, she's moved
from a tent to the mini mall.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.202
DAISY:
I'm so hungover.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.671
I was doing shots

06:43.704 --> 06:45.806
with that band from
Fairhope last night.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.509
Did anyone see that trash
Wade Kinsella went off with?

06:48.542 --> 06:50.010
I know!

06:50.043 --> 06:52.713
I just saw him do his
drive of shame back into town.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.848
If I had known he was lowering
his standards like that,

06:54.882 --> 06:56.183
I would have
hit on him myself.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.122
(sighs)

07:03.557 --> 07:05.926
Oh, hey, Doc,
you're, uh, out of hot water.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.097
And apparently I'm in it.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.599
Where the hell have you been?

07:11.632 --> 07:14.201
My phone ran out of juice,
and you were right,

07:14.234 --> 07:16.169
I should do a better job
of keeping it charged.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.572
I know that you left the bar
last night with another woman.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.574
Oh.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.909
(sighs)

07:21.942 --> 07:25.513
Doc, I was in
a really dark place night.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.547
And I did

07:26.580 --> 07:27.481
leave the bar with someone.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.817
I walked a girl out to her car,
all right.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.820
Her battery was dead,
she said she needed a jump,

07:32.853 --> 07:36.490
and, yeah, you know,
something could have happened.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.658
Maybe she wanted it to.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.692
I don't know.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.594
But it didn't.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.964
Well, then where have you been?

07:43.997 --> 07:45.633
Drunk.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.569
Because I didn't win
the $20,000.

07:48.602 --> 07:52.072
Because my band sucked.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.708
Because I spent the night

07:54.742 --> 07:57.077
in the back of my car,
in a field.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.912
Outside of Daphne.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.187
I was freaking out.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.923
I thought...

08:09.957 --> 08:12.593
I'm sorry that I didn't
make it to hear you play.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.262
And I know I put my foot in
it about Battle of the Bands.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.664
I pushed you too hard.

08:16.697 --> 08:17.698
Well, thank you.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.835
So, what'd I miss around here?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.737
It's BlueBell; what's
there to miss?
(chuckles)

08:23.771 --> 08:24.772
(knock on door)

08:27.641 --> 08:28.642
Well, there's that.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.843
Tom, what are
you doing here?

08:29.877 --> 08:32.011
Well, I was getting ready to
practice our wedding dance,

08:32.044 --> 08:33.614
but then Wanda
postponed the wedding.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.049
Said it was doctor's orders.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.052
So, thank you, Doctor.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.087
Um, I should
probably...

08:41.121 --> 08:42.155
Yeah.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.024
...go deal with this.
Mm-hmm.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.926
Wade, I'm so
glad you're back.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.135
(car horn honks)

08:55.168 --> 08:57.237
(seagulls calling)

08:57.270 --> 08:59.573
(birds singing)

09:09.282 --> 09:11.051
Dr. Hart?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.987
Oh, hey, Wanda. Thanks for
coming back to see me.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.223
Earlier, when I implied
that planning a wedding

09:16.256 --> 09:19.259
might be stressful, I didn't
mean for you to postpone it.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.928
Well, I did postpone.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.831
And, the worst part
is, an hour later...

09:23.864 --> 09:25.599
the hives were back.
ZOE: Oh, no.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.134
WOMAN:
Poor thing.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.802
The family was just
sitting down for lunch,

09:28.836 --> 09:30.070
and she started
scratching away like crazy.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.071
I'm Joyce.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.239
I'm Zoe Hart.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.774
So nice to meet
Wanda's friends.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.710
I'll wait outside, sweetie,
so you two can chat.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.612
(sighs loudly)

09:40.814 --> 09:42.650
Family all here
for the big event?
Yes.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.352
It's always so tense
when my mother's around.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.921
She drinks
and she argues,

09:47.955 --> 09:50.691
and, well,
she seems worse than ever.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.159
Well, my mother is
no picnic either.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.695
But at least now we know
the source of your hives.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.798
You're right.

09:57.831 --> 09:58.932
Great news!

09:58.966 --> 10:01.802
We just have to figure out
a way to stop your mother

10:01.835 --> 10:03.036
from stressing
you out so much.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.337
Easier said than done.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.973
What would you do?

10:06.006 --> 10:10.110
Well, if it were me, I would
probably assign someone

10:10.143 --> 10:12.379
from my bridal party to
run a mother interference.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.281
You know, keep her
happy and off your back.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.149
(laughs):
That's genius!

10:16.183 --> 10:17.851
And...

10:17.885 --> 10:20.320
I know just who
it should be.

10:20.353 --> 10:24.157
Zoe Hart, will you
be my maid of honor?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.995
Wow, that is so nice.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.129
I need you.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.298
I mean, just talking to you
has made me less itchy.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.667
No one's ever asked me
to be a bridesmaid before.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.002
Not even my cousin, Olivia.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.136
Rude, right?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.706
So, is that a yes?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.273
(sighs)

10:40.307 --> 10:41.909
Yes, I will help you, Wanda.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.744
(shrieks, laughs)

10:43.777 --> 10:45.312
Aw.
(laughs)

10:45.345 --> 10:47.180
Oh.
Whoo!

10:48.181 --> 10:50.083
(gasps)

10:50.117 --> 10:52.419
You come in here, and
instantly you feel a powerful

10:52.452 --> 10:54.087
connection to
the spirit world.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.989
Really? Because I'm feeling
more of a connection

10:56.023 --> 10:58.658
to the auto parts store
that was here last week.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.031
Welcome, Ms. Breeland.

11:07.935 --> 11:11.872
The tarot cards tell me
that you fear an upcoming event.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.908
Well, what else do they say?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.910
They say that this
event you fear,

11:16.944 --> 11:19.346
you will not have
to bear it alone.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.915
Ooh, so she'll get a date
for Tom and Wanda's wedding.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.283
How will she meet him?

11:23.316 --> 11:27.420
My dear, you have already
met your true companion.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.994
GEORGE:
Thank you very much

11:34.027 --> 11:35.796
for meeting with us,
Mayor Gainey.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.064
I, uh... I figure,

11:37.097 --> 11:38.766
since we all know each other,

11:38.799 --> 11:41.068
that sitting down
and talking this thing through

11:41.101 --> 11:43.036
is probably our best
course of action.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.338
George Tucker,
you're opposing counsel.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.074
(chuckling):
That's great news.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.175
Scooter McGreevy.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.843
Haven't seen you
since, uh...

11:49.877 --> 11:51.812
Since I whupped your butt
in the Mackenzie case.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.947
I got a new truck
out of it, so thanks.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.515
TODD:
Listen, Hayes, uh,

11:55.548 --> 11:57.851
we know you got
your panties in a roll

11:57.885 --> 12:01.922
about this shopping mall thing,
so we've decided to, uh,

12:01.955 --> 12:04.925
offer you a cut
of the profits.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.059
Get this through
your head:

12:06.093 --> 12:07.494
I'm not looking
to make a buck.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.996
Now, we want
you to move

12:09.029 --> 12:10.764
your mall away from
our shoreline.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.100
But shoppers spend more
when there's a view.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.434
That's a proven fact.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.069
I'm sorry.
Have we changed the definition

12:16.103 --> 12:17.971
of "a proven fact"
to "crap you made up"?

12:18.005 --> 12:19.539
GEORGE:
Okay, listen, fellas,
we are very simply

12:19.572 --> 12:22.175
asking you
to start taking steps

12:22.209 --> 12:24.778
to move your development,
or...

12:24.812 --> 12:26.079
Or... what?

12:26.113 --> 12:29.116
You'll take us to court,
try and get an injunction?

12:29.149 --> 12:32.019
Please, Tucker, we all know
you're gonna cave.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.286
Okay. Listen.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.889
If you are referring
to the Mackenzie suit,

12:35.923 --> 12:36.990
they asked me

12:37.024 --> 12:38.325
to settle
against my counsel.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.227
We had that case in the bag.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.562
I guess we'll never know--
since you caved.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.998
I didn't cave then,
and we are not caving now.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.967
We'll see you in court.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.571
(chuckling)

12:51.604 --> 12:53.406
Oh... Excuse me.
(gasps) Oh.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.875
I'm sorry.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.244
Wow. Lemon Breeland.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.880
Do you remember me?

12:59.913 --> 13:01.281
Dale King, from
second grade?

13:01.314 --> 13:03.250
Uh... wow, Dale.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.552
I... I haven't seen you
in forever.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.821
Well, I mean,
since second grade.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.958
Um...

13:10.991 --> 13:13.861
this is either
an incredible coincidence or...

13:13.894 --> 13:15.495
Do you want to get some dinner?

13:15.528 --> 13:17.364
Dinner with Lemon Breeland.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.832
Wow.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.168
(laughs) Great.
Oh, and no pressure,

13:21.201 --> 13:22.836
but, um, are you free
in two days?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.571
Oh, and do you have a tux?

13:28.075 --> 13:31.044
And that's when I said,
"Sure, the rules of perpetuity

13:31.078 --> 13:32.512
do cover
that transaction."

13:32.545 --> 13:34.147
(laughing)

13:34.181 --> 13:36.049
Joyce, you are so funny.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.317
Well, you know
us accountants.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.585
(laughs) Oh.
(phone vibrating)

13:38.618 --> 13:39.953
Look, it's
Wanda's father.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.454
I'll be right back.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.858
She loves you.

13:44.892 --> 13:45.926
Joyce is great.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.194
I, myself,
might not tell

13:47.227 --> 13:49.229
quite as many
tax loophole stories,

13:49.262 --> 13:51.164
but your mother
isn't dramatic at all.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.599
WOMAN: Oh, wow, this
is what I needed.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.601
JOYCE: It's nice
to see you, Betsy.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.069
Oh, no, no.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.437
Joyce is my stepmother.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.939
She's a peach.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.273
That out there,

14:00.307 --> 14:01.308
that's my real mother.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.510
The cringe-y parts
of four Bravo reality shows

14:03.543 --> 14:04.611
wrapped in one

14:04.644 --> 14:06.146
very small woman.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.347
The hell you will!

14:07.380 --> 14:10.017
This is my baby's wedding,
and if you,

14:10.050 --> 14:11.518
the floozy who
destroyed my marriage,

14:11.551 --> 14:13.620
thinks she has a say in
any of this, you're crazy.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.092
Mom, this is Dr. Zoe Hart,
my maid of honor.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.260
She is really

14:20.293 --> 14:22.629
looking forward
to getting to know you.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.265
Yay.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.135
Wade.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.270
Hey.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.106
We need to talk.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.242
Look, I know, all right?

14:35.275 --> 14:36.409
I'm sorry.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.545
I was a mess last night,
and I shouldn't have

14:38.578 --> 14:40.413
kicked you out of the band.
I get it-- you're pissed.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.950
No, the reason I'm pissed
is because you left the bar

14:42.983 --> 14:44.384
with a woman
that wasn't Zoe Hart.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.986
Who, Claudette?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.587
Oh, I get it, all right?

14:47.620 --> 14:48.989
It looked bad.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.390
But, as I already
told Zoe,

14:50.423 --> 14:51.691
she just
wanted a jump

14:51.724 --> 14:54.694
for her car... which I gave her.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.330
I'm stupid, but I ain't
that stupid. Come on.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.503
(inhales deeply)

15:03.536 --> 15:05.072
(exhales) Okay.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.273
All right, then.
Wow, that's a...

15:06.306 --> 15:07.174
that's a...
that's a relief.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.541
I'm actually
really relieved to hear that.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.642
I'm sorry
I accused you, man.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.644
I... No hard feelings?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.182
Changed man, Wade.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.151
Changed man.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.487
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.331
(door opens)

15:32.399 --> 15:34.401
There you are.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.737
I thought you were
gonna come by last night.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.407
Yeah, Wanda needed me
to work late, so, you know...

15:40.440 --> 15:42.309
Okay.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.044
Can I tell you...
Well, guess what!

15:44.077 --> 15:46.046
Uh... sorry.
Sorry.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.247
Go ahead.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.581
Okay.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.684
Wanda asked me to be
her maid of honor.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.287
Despite the fact
that I'm kind of in charge

15:54.321 --> 15:57.257
of her very intense
Auntie Mame of a mother,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.459
I... I'm a little excited
about it.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.294
Is it okay?
It's gonna keep me

16:01.328 --> 16:02.595
pretty busy the
next couple days.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.197
Uh, of course it's okay. Yeah.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.632
Well, it's just that
we haven't really

16:05.665 --> 16:07.200
had a change to hang out,

16:07.234 --> 16:09.269
and I wanted to make
it all up to you.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.403
I'll be fine, all right?

16:10.437 --> 16:11.471
You go have fun.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.572
Thank you.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.441
What was it that
you wanted to say?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.609
Uh...

16:16.643 --> 16:19.079
just...

16:19.112 --> 16:22.615
that you're amazing
and I'm lucky to have you.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.084
Wow.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.585
I've never had

16:25.618 --> 16:27.320
an "amazing" before.
Well, there it is.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.588
Come here.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.431
(door opens)

16:38.465 --> 16:39.766
(sighs)

16:39.799 --> 16:41.068
(door closes)

16:45.272 --> 16:46.573
Hey, ladies!

16:46.606 --> 16:48.341
It's me,
your maid of honor.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.542
You can call me
"Your Honor."

16:49.576 --> 16:51.144
Or "madam."

16:52.279 --> 16:53.346
Or "Zoe" is fine.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.781
She's weird. I like her.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.116
TANSY: She's the
maid of honor?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.251
What are her credentials?

16:58.285 --> 17:00.087
Do you even know her?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.254
Tomorrow is the big day,

17:01.288 --> 17:03.123
and there's lots to do,
so I found

17:03.156 --> 17:05.592
a list of wedding essentials
on the Internet.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.759
You know what's
always a hoot?

17:06.792 --> 17:07.760
The Bunny Hop.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.662
(makes buzzer noise)
The Bunny Hop?

17:09.695 --> 17:12.398
Could you get
any lamer, Joyce?

17:12.432 --> 17:14.367
It's fun. You hop.

17:16.736 --> 17:20.406
Okay, how about
we divide and conquer?

17:20.440 --> 17:21.241
Betsy and I will deal

17:21.273 --> 17:22.642
with the wedding cake
and the flowers,

17:22.675 --> 17:23.476
and the rest of you

17:23.510 --> 17:25.744
can split up
the rest of this stuff.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.746
Perfect!
What a
wonderful idea.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.349
All righty, then.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.351
(clears throat)

17:31.384 --> 17:33.120
Thanks for that.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.288
So, look, ever
since the divorce,

17:35.322 --> 17:36.523
Mom has been a
little wild.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.426
Whatever you do, don't
let her drink gin.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.328
Don't let her
talk to any men,

17:41.361 --> 17:43.263
especially while she's
drinking the gin.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.232
Or any clear
liquor, really.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.234
And don't lose her.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.635
Wanda, I'm a doctor.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.204
I save people;
I don't lose them.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.706
Really?
(chuckles)

17:53.740 --> 17:55.375
Where is she now?

17:57.610 --> 17:58.845
Oh.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.147
Found her.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.454
Hey, Wade, you look
handsome today.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.722
Uh... likewise, pal.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.890
Congrats on the
big nuptials.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.193
Thanks. Uh, so I was
wondering, would...

18:13.226 --> 18:14.827
would you maybe
be my best man?

18:14.861 --> 18:15.762
(clears throat)

18:15.795 --> 18:19.599
Uh... I thought Cody
was your best friend.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.735
Yeah, I love Cody,
but you're Wade Kinsella.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.204
And, uh,
since Dr. Hart

18:24.237 --> 18:25.838
is maid of honor,
it seems only fitting.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.540
Uh, yeah.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.809
Yeah, sure, dude.
Whatever.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.311
Awesome sauce.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.746
So, as my best man,
I was hoping you might offer me

18:33.780 --> 18:35.348
some guidance about,
you know, tomorrow night,

18:35.382 --> 18:36.716
me and Wanda's wedding night,
because I...

18:36.749 --> 18:39.419
No. No. God, no.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.222
I want to, uh, please Wanda.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.224
Uh... be my sex Yoda?

18:44.257 --> 18:46.826
No. No, I won't
be your sex Yoda.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.496
Just rent a Ryan Gosling
movie, all right?

18:49.529 --> 18:50.830
Do what he does.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.199
Ugh.
Okay.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.267
He... he does make
the ladies crazy.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.802
Oh, he sure does.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.772
(sighs) Whoo!

18:59.806 --> 19:01.241
We are ready.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.176
Oh, I was up all
night preparing.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.911
I got a... I got a
PowerPoint presentation

19:04.944 --> 19:05.978
detailing the
economic impact.

19:06.012 --> 19:09.216
I got depositions from
all the local businesses.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.451
I got a statement from an
environmental scientist.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.719
This injunction
is in the bag.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.521
Gainey's not gonna
know what hit him!

19:14.554 --> 19:15.722
(laughing)

19:15.755 --> 19:17.657
I have to say--
impressive.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.259
What-what...
what's going on, George?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.660
I never seen
this side of you before.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.928
Yeah, that's because
I haven't let

19:21.961 --> 19:23.796
this side of me out
since New York.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.398
Oh, but Scooter McGreevy--

19:25.432 --> 19:27.400
oh, he let the
litigation monster out.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.835
The monster was undefeated.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.936
He was also

19:29.969 --> 19:30.937
a little bit of an ass,

19:30.970 --> 19:33.406
which is why I should
probably go to the gym

19:33.440 --> 19:34.607
and release
some of this tension.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.808
Oh, oh, whoa.
Undefeated?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.877
No, no, no, no.

19:37.910 --> 19:38.978
Don't release anything.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.713
We... we're keeping the monster.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.250
(growls)

19:43.283 --> 19:44.684
(growls) Yeah.

19:44.717 --> 19:45.718
(both laughing)

19:45.752 --> 19:47.220
ZOE: Well, the buttercream
 is classic,

19:47.254 --> 19:48.421
but the chocolate
banana...

19:48.455 --> 19:49.689
Is perfect.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.958
Wanda's father and
Joyce will hate it.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.426
Oh.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.428
Well, Baxley is such
a fuddy-duddy, and...

19:55.462 --> 19:57.364
he'd want traditional,
so no traditional.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.333
Did I mention Joyce
used to be his secretary?

20:00.367 --> 20:01.868
Chocolate banana it is.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.504
I like you more
every minute.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.638
You are fabulous.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.307
I want to know
all about you.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.576
What do you say we ditch
picking out the flowers--

20:09.609 --> 20:10.977
who cares anyway?--
get ourselves

20:11.010 --> 20:12.445
a drinky-poo and bond?

20:12.479 --> 20:14.747
Oh, I don't think
that's a great idea.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.815
Come on, Zoe Hart.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.717
Don't you be a
fuddy-duddy, too.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.786
YOLO!
Oh, no.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.456
LEMON:
 Dale King,

20:23.490 --> 20:25.792
I can't believe you've lived
in this town this whole time.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.760
What have you been up to
since second grade?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.362
Well, I like to CrossFit.
Mm-hmm.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.897
And I make my own orange soda.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.765
Oh. (chuckles)

20:33.833 --> 20:35.268
Crickett,
what are you smiling about?

20:35.302 --> 20:37.737
Lemon and I went
to a psychic.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.806
She predicted Lemon
had already met

20:39.839 --> 20:42.342
her date for the
wedding, and look.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.278
Dale King?

20:45.312 --> 20:47.880
Oh, he was bizarre
in second grade.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.649
And ever since
his parents decided

20:49.682 --> 20:51.784
to homeschool him in third,
he's worse.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.020
I think they're
falling in love.

20:54.053 --> 20:57.023
You are just as beautiful
as you were when we were eight.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.291
Oh...

20:58.325 --> 20:59.559
Tell me, um,

20:59.592 --> 21:00.860
do you still eat paste?

21:02.895 --> 21:04.464
Um... (laughs)

21:04.497 --> 21:06.299
I only ate paste that one time.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.835
Lori Openden
dared me to, so...

21:08.868 --> 21:10.603
Well, that was
an important moment for me,

21:10.637 --> 21:11.871
as a devoted paste eater.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.540
ANNABETH:
Lemon!

21:13.573 --> 21:16.443
There is an emergency...
with your father.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.044
My father? Is he okay?

21:18.077 --> 21:21.581
He... locked himself
out of the house.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.615
I thought that he was away.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.017
Oh.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.886
Locked out.
Yeah.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.556
You know, I am so
terribly sorry about this,

21:29.589 --> 21:31.824
but I... I really should go.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.527
It has been so...

21:34.561 --> 21:36.563
Bye.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.898
I'll see you soon. When I
watch you through your window.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.937
Betsy, you know, maybe
we've had enough to drink.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.773
We should probably get
back to the hotel.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.940
Big day tomorrow.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.041
Nonsense.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.043
We are having
a great time.

21:51.077 --> 21:54.080
I want to meet
this boyfriend of yours.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.515
Well, hey.
Wade!

21:55.548 --> 21:56.749
This is him.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.385
Wade, this is Betsy
Maynard, Wanda's mom.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.852
It is a pleasure to meet you.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.522
You are as yummy
as the doctor said.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.090
Come on, stop.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.725
Can you get me drink?

22:05.758 --> 22:07.427
(mouthing)
No problemo.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.961
On the house.
Oh!

22:08.995 --> 22:10.597
(laughing)
Oh, yeah.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.098
Caroline Todd!

22:12.131 --> 22:13.566
How have you been?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.402
Wow. You have your hands full.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.569
I do. She keeps saying

22:16.603 --> 22:18.705
that she has to go
to the ladies room,

22:18.738 --> 22:20.840
and then she comes back
even more loaded.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.109
But besides that,
she's actually pretty fun.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.577
How are you?

22:24.611 --> 22:27.614
I am... Tom
Long's best man.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.650
Yeah. I will be wearing a
Jedi costume and everything.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.984
(laughing):
No.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.754
Seriously? Why did you
agree to that?

22:34.787 --> 22:36.088
Well, you're Wanda's
maid of honor.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.990
I thought it would be kind of...
romantic,

22:38.024 --> 22:40.092
walk down the aisle together
and all that.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.594
You did?

22:41.628 --> 22:43.463
Wow, that is so unlike you.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.865
Yeah, well, I'm changing.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.900
I guess so.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.370
Where's Betsy?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.740
Dash,

22:53.773 --> 22:54.741
did you see Wanda's

22:54.774 --> 22:55.908
mom out there?

22:55.942 --> 22:58.077
Uh, Betsy?
Yes, I just saw her

22:58.110 --> 23:00.580
climb into a truck
with a mysterious gentleman.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.515
(laughs)
I declare,

23:02.549 --> 23:04.617
some women just can't
hold their liquor.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.619
Good grief.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.534
Hey.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.835
Hey ya, Sal.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.837
Sorry to knock so early,

23:24.871 --> 23:26.773
but I seem
to have lost someone.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.141
I've been up all night
looking for her, so I figured

23:29.175 --> 23:31.010
I'd go door to door.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.813
Does Betsy Maynard
happen to be here?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.181
Honey pie?

23:35.214 --> 23:37.416
You got company.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.621
Oh. Ew.

23:41.654 --> 23:42.622
Ew. No.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.856
Isn't he just adorable?

23:43.890 --> 23:46.759
What is it with women in this
town and Sal the Shrimp Guy?

23:46.793 --> 23:47.927
Yeah, I'm sorry I...

23:47.960 --> 23:49.729
I disappeared on
you, Zoe darling.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.964
I needed to get
my engine revved.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.934
Ooh. Well, now you need
to get it checked for STDs.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.870
But first, we have
to get ready for a wedding.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.772
Those two are too
young to get married.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.674
They're just
rushing in. I thought

24:01.708 --> 24:04.644
I'd keep my feelings to myself,
but I can't watch it happen.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.679
W-What? What-what do you mean?

24:06.713 --> 24:07.747
I'm not going to
that wedding, honey.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.816
You give Wanda my love.

24:12.919 --> 24:15.755
I can't believe
you got the injunction!

24:15.788 --> 24:18.625
You were like Tom Cruise
in A Few Good Men,

24:18.658 --> 24:20.793
meets Tom Cruise
in The Firm meets

24:20.827 --> 24:22.228
Tom Cruise jumping
on Oprah's couch!

24:22.261 --> 24:23.696
(sighs)

24:23.730 --> 24:25.565
Sharp, wily and...
just a little unhinged.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.534
What do you think my
best part was, huh?

24:27.567 --> 24:29.702
I liked when you objected
to McGreevy.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.904
Just 'cause I didn't like the
way he was looking at me.

24:31.938 --> 24:32.972
Aha!

24:33.005 --> 24:35.908
I told you, you didn't want
to mess with my lawyer.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.546
(singsong):
You lost. You lost.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.113
Your shopping mall is gone.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.982
You lost. You lost.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.684
That also means...

24:44.717 --> 24:46.719
we won.
Ah!

24:46.753 --> 24:47.854
LAVON:
Bye-bye, now.

24:47.887 --> 24:48.888
Oh, man, we
showed them.
Mm.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.990
We showed them.
Pow, pow, pow, pow!
Oh, oh.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.992
I-I am so amped
up right now!

24:53.025 --> 24:55.294
Okay, cowboy, time to put
the monster to bed now.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.530
You crazy? Put the
monster to bed?

24:57.564 --> 24:58.865
Lavon, I'm feeling
more energized than

24:58.898 --> 25:00.900
I have in my
entire life. I...

25:00.933 --> 25:02.869
I have to go for a run.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.003
Oh, wait!

25:04.036 --> 25:05.872
W-We have a wedding
to get ready for!

25:05.905 --> 25:07.940
See you there!
(whooping)

25:07.974 --> 25:09.308
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
(laughs)

25:09.341 --> 25:10.710
Oh, he splits the D!

25:10.743 --> 25:11.811
Whoo!
Oh!

25:11.844 --> 25:13.145
(laughing)

25:14.647 --> 25:16.082
Oh! There she is.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.283
My maid of honor.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.018
Yay! Here I am!

25:19.051 --> 25:21.020
Everyone looks
so good!

25:21.053 --> 25:22.154
So elfish!

25:22.188 --> 25:23.890
And we can reuse the dresses

25:23.923 --> 25:25.892
any time we go to a convention.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.727
Madam, why aren't
you dressed?

25:27.760 --> 25:29.295
And where's Betsy?

25:29.328 --> 25:30.262
She wanted to meditate

25:30.296 --> 25:32.765
and work on
her mother-of-the-bride speech,

25:32.799 --> 25:34.233
so she's getting
dressed at my house.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.302
Hey, Tansy.
Mm-hmm.

25:36.335 --> 25:38.771
Can I talk to you
about my highlights?

25:38.805 --> 25:40.640
(quietly): I hope this really is
about your highlights--

25:40.673 --> 25:42.709
which need work-- and not
the fact that you obviously lost

25:42.742 --> 25:44.844
the mother of the bride
on the day of the wedding.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.978
You had one job!

25:46.012 --> 25:46.913
I did not lose her.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.915
Okay, I lost her,
but then I found her.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.049
Then why isn't she here?

25:50.082 --> 25:52.184
She thinks that Wanda is
going to get her heart broken,

25:52.218 --> 25:54.053
so she's refusing to
come. What do I do?

25:54.086 --> 25:55.888
Seriously, worst
maid of honor ever!
I...

25:55.922 --> 25:59.859
Zoe? Zoe, um, my
mom's okay, right?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.294
Because I know she
drives me crazy,

26:02.328 --> 26:04.330
and her craziness
gives me hives,

26:04.363 --> 26:06.766
but I need her
by my side--

26:06.799 --> 26:09.068
preferably this
side-- because it is,

26:09.101 --> 26:11.738
like, super itchy, and
she could just, like...

26:11.771 --> 26:14.674
Wanda, you entrusted me
in taking care of your mother.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.609
She is going to make it
to your wedding.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.945
I'm just gonna go buy
some rice to throw.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.680
Throwing rice kills birds.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.782
I am just gonna go
buy some birdseed,

26:22.815 --> 26:24.283
and I'll be right back.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.120
WOMAN (on TV):
 Menea means

26:28.154 --> 26:30.690
to shake or wind
or whatever you want to do.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.825
Here we go.
March it out, walk it out.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.360
Have fun.

26:34.393 --> 26:35.995
(woman on TV speaks Spanish)

26:36.028 --> 26:39.398
Jump it out right here
and give it...

26:39.431 --> 26:41.734
Turn the TV off.
Put this on.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.269
You are going
to Wanda's wedding.

26:43.302 --> 26:46.739
You don't know
what's gonna happen.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.374
Maybe Tom and Wanda can make it.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.409
You know, they really
love each other.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.679
I loved someone once.

26:52.712 --> 26:56.148
I remember the day
my life fell apart.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.150
Baxley'd spent the whole night
at work.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.686
He didn't even call.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.889
Came up with some lame
excuse about tax season.

27:05.024 --> 27:08.127
I wanted to believe him, so
I made myself ignore the fact

27:08.160 --> 27:10.396
that he was acting
weird and distant.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.199
But at the same time,
too sweet, too accommodating.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.703
That he couldn't make any
real eye contact anymore.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.940
I made myself busy,

27:20.973 --> 27:23.409
determined that I
wasn't gonna see...

27:23.442 --> 27:25.745
(laughs)

27:25.778 --> 27:28.280
...what my heart
already knew.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.419
But the doubt just
started to eat away at me

27:33.452 --> 27:35.421
until I couldn't
stand it anymore.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.289
What did you do?

27:37.323 --> 27:39.325
I asked him.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.764
And he told me...

27:44.797 --> 27:46.432
what I'd known
all along.

27:46.465 --> 27:50.036
And my world just...

27:50.069 --> 27:52.138
stopped.

27:53.973 --> 27:57.810
So... how am I supposed
to go to that wedding,

27:57.844 --> 28:00.112
stand next to them,

28:00.146 --> 28:03.449
and watch my
little girl

28:03.482 --> 28:06.185
open herself up
to that same pain?

28:11.090 --> 28:13.192
You okay?

28:13.225 --> 28:16.195
Yes.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.097
No, not at all, actually.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.802
But we can't think
about our feelings now.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.071
We have to think
about Wanda.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.473
And you not going
to her wedding is something

28:27.506 --> 28:29.375
that you will never
forgive yourself for.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.217
Okay.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.252
I will get dressed.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.246
(gasps)

29:07.279 --> 29:09.215
Oh, Wanda.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.318
My mother's dress.
You look beautiful.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.387
I thought you'd be dressed
as an elf, too.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.157
Oh, at the end of the day,
I wanted a real dress.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.392
But I am wearing these.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.994
BETSY:
Oh.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.162
Oh.
(laughter)

29:23.195 --> 29:25.364
Honey. (laughs)

29:25.397 --> 29:28.367
Now, where's your bouquet?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.871
Well, uh, you were in
charge of the flowers.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.006
But I made a run
to the flower market,

29:34.040 --> 29:35.441
put together
some extra bouquets,

29:35.474 --> 29:38.144
in case there was
an emergency or something.

29:38.177 --> 29:42.281
Well... that was plain
good thinking, Joyce.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.884
What? It was?

29:44.917 --> 29:47.586
Here, let me help you
with those flowers.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.922
Oh, my God!

29:49.956 --> 29:52.291
What did you do?

29:52.324 --> 29:54.226
My mother was nearly
nice to Joyce.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.427
Thank you, thank you.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.296
You look beautiful.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.331
Thank you.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.070
A, uh, chocolate
banana wedding cake?

30:04.103 --> 30:05.872
Who's gonna eat that?

30:05.905 --> 30:08.207
But I do have to
give you credit.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.609
You got Betsy here.
You did good.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.545
You know, I may
have misjudged you.

30:13.579 --> 30:17.183
I kind of see what all the
fuss is about all of a sudden.

30:17.216 --> 30:18.484
Wade's a lucky guy.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.955
You okay?

30:22.989 --> 30:25.224
No.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.259
Well, it's just...

30:28.627 --> 30:31.297
You know what?
Never mind. I'm fine.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.332
BETSY:
Hey, let's move
it, ladies!

30:33.365 --> 30:34.934
Wedding's about
to start.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.969
People, let's gather
at the door.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.376
Lemon darling,
you're all set.

30:44.410 --> 30:47.113
Is that nice Walt taking you
to the wedding?

30:47.146 --> 30:49.215
Oh, actually,
Walt and I broke up.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.449
Oh, no.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.051
Oh, it's fine.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.619
I'm an independent woman, so...

30:53.652 --> 30:56.122
Oh, honey, you were
just left at the altar.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.224
There's a
difference between

30:58.257 --> 31:00.526
being independent
and unspeakably sad.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.328
You should not go to
this wedding alone.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.564
Well, why not? I am!

31:12.538 --> 31:15.307
Way to go.

31:15.341 --> 31:18.010
You and your stupid
advice ruined the wedding.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.211
What are you talking about?

31:19.245 --> 31:21.647
Tom's refusing to
walk down the aisle.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.349
(Wade sighs)

31:23.382 --> 31:26.252
All right.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.154
Hey, Tom.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.256
Uh, what's going on, man?

31:30.289 --> 31:33.092
I watched the stupid
 Notebook sex scene.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.561
She takes off her clothes
on one side of the room,

31:35.594 --> 31:37.663
and he takes off his,
and she's real happy

31:37.696 --> 31:39.698
because he's got
those Ryan Gosling abs.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.934
If it's those abs
that women want,

31:41.968 --> 31:44.670
Wanda's gonna live
a lifetime of disappointment.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.438
Tom, what women like
about Ryan Gosling

31:46.472 --> 31:48.040
in that movie is his body.

31:48.074 --> 31:51.944
But what they love about him
is him going out on that boat

31:51.978 --> 31:55.414
with that chick in the rain
with them stupid ducks.

31:55.447 --> 31:59.218
He's, like, the most romantic
dude ever, and so are you.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.419
I'm not like
Ryan Gosling.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.088
Yeah, you are.

32:03.655 --> 32:07.593
And you're a good,
honest, loyal guy.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.198
That's why Wanda loves you.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.169
All right, let's get married.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.571
All right.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.407
Me and Wanda,
not me and you.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.641
Yup.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.448
(George sighs)

32:29.481 --> 32:32.318
Oh! Oh, man, this
is gonna be awesome.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.087
Lord of the Rings, Star
 Wars mash-up wedding.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.355
Uh, George?
Yeah?

32:36.388 --> 32:38.057
Why are you
still like that?

32:38.090 --> 32:39.591
I'm so pumped up.
I feel like Rocky.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.328
Oh. We should go run the steps
of the courthouse.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.429
Right now, yeah.

32:43.462 --> 32:46.532
George, the courthouse has,
like, three steps on it.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.200
Oh, that's a good point.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.535
Hey.
Oh, hey! Hey.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.470
Aren't you supposed
to be tending the bride?

32:51.503 --> 32:53.205
What's going
on with him?

32:53.239 --> 32:55.374
It's a legal strategy.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.576
Okay.
(chuckles)

32:57.609 --> 33:01.347
George, d-did you talk to
Wade about the other night?

33:01.380 --> 33:03.349
Yes, everything's fine.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.051
Nothing happened
with that girl.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.152
Her battery just died, so...

33:06.185 --> 33:09.421
Her battery died?

33:09.455 --> 33:12.224
Well, when you say it
like that, it sounds bad,

33:12.258 --> 33:14.193
but he was very sincere.

33:14.226 --> 33:17.429
Yeah, I've seen Wade's
sincerity before

33:17.463 --> 33:20.366
and I've also heard
the one about the girl

33:20.399 --> 33:22.534
with the dead
battery before.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.636
LAVON:
Tansy,

33:24.670 --> 33:27.005
what are you saying?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.609
*

33:34.246 --> 33:37.149
(lasers firing)

33:54.266 --> 33:56.702
You look beautiful.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.612
*

34:28.199 --> 34:30.768
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

34:30.802 --> 34:34.505
to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

34:34.540 --> 34:38.143
I, Tom, take you, Wanda,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

34:38.177 --> 34:41.447
To laugh with you
and cry with you,

34:41.480 --> 34:43.581
to be open
and honest,

34:43.614 --> 34:46.185
and to cherish you for as
long as we both shall live.

34:46.217 --> 34:49.321
Secure in the knowledge

34:49.355 --> 34:51.790
that you will be
my constant friend,

34:51.822 --> 34:55.460
my faithful
partner in life,

34:55.494 --> 34:58.664
and my one true love.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.900
REVEREND:
You may kiss the bride.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.503
*

35:10.242 --> 35:12.110
(laughing)

35:27.593 --> 35:29.295
(whispers):
Zoe...

35:29.328 --> 35:31.263
(whispers):
I know.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.407
*

35:54.953 --> 35:58.924
The other day when
you asked me...

35:58.957 --> 36:01.227
I wanted to pretend
it didn't happen.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.531
I couldn't even
admit it to myself.

36:07.733 --> 36:11.570
But I...

36:11.603 --> 36:13.805
I did a stupid thing.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.908
And it meant
nothing to me.

36:18.910 --> 36:23.849
I was drunk
and I was in a dark place,

36:23.882 --> 36:26.352
and...

36:31.257 --> 36:34.326
Zoe, please
say something.

36:34.360 --> 36:38.297
It's eerie when
you don't talk.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.832
What do you want me
to say, Wade?

36:42.834 --> 36:46.605
Baby, I want you to tell
me you'll forgive me.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.808
Please forgive me.

36:49.841 --> 36:53.679
Because I will
do... I will do

36:53.712 --> 36:56.848
anything to make this up to you.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.884
As much as we tried,
let's face it,

36:58.917 --> 37:03.622
we're probably too different
to make it work, so...

37:04.590 --> 37:06.825
I'm sorry
that I pushed you

37:06.858 --> 37:09.595
to be something
that you're not.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.898
But the way that you responded--

37:12.931 --> 37:17.736
you had to know that
that would be the one thing.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.840
(sniffles)

37:21.873 --> 37:24.476
Now, if you will
excuse me...

37:26.077 --> 37:28.647
...we have a reception
to get to.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.892
*

37:52.971 --> 37:54.940
Well, despite the fact

37:54.973 --> 37:56.708
that the groomsmen
donned lightsabers,

37:56.742 --> 37:58.710
it was a very
lovely wedding.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.847
That it was.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.316
Thank you for saving me
from Dale last night.

38:04.350 --> 38:05.684
You're welcome.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.486
And thank you for coming
to the wedding with me.

38:07.519 --> 38:08.887
I didn't realize
how traumatized

38:08.920 --> 38:09.888
I was by the last one

38:09.921 --> 38:11.990
until it was time for
me to go to this one.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.892
I know.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.928
Sometimes, AnnaBeth, I
think that you know me

38:16.962 --> 38:18.430
better than I know myself.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.566
Despite everything,

38:20.599 --> 38:21.633
I think that
psychic was right.

38:21.667 --> 38:25.103
I did go to the wedding
with my true companion.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.373
Me?

38:27.406 --> 38:29.074
Are you sure?
Not Dale?

38:29.107 --> 38:30.442
That is not funny.

38:30.476 --> 38:33.111
He could have carved me
up into a million pieces.
Well, at least

38:33.144 --> 38:36.515
he would have enough paste
to put you back together.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.992
Jedi cake?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.996
Oh, no, thanks.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.536
BETSY:
Look at those two weirdos.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.405
You may be right.

38:59.438 --> 39:02.040
They might be
happy after all.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.676
Someone in this family should,
statistically.

39:04.710 --> 39:07.579
Well, I guess
that's true.

39:07.613 --> 39:09.448
Where's Wade?

39:09.481 --> 39:12.884
Oh, um...

39:12.918 --> 39:14.920
I don't know.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.424
I see.

39:18.457 --> 39:23.094
One day, you'll find
your weirdo, too, Zoe Hart.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.840
There's the best man.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.975
Hey, Tom,
congratulations.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.076
Real happy for you, man.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.446
I couldn't have done it
without you.

39:40.479 --> 39:44.850
Just, uh... promise me
you'll be good to her.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.529
The monster's still here.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.535
I'm sorry, Wally, I'm so sorry.
Go, go, go.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.572
You're not gonna like this,
but this is for your own good.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.639
What are you talking about?
(grunts)

40:07.673 --> 40:08.807
(coughs)

40:12.077 --> 40:14.045
What the hell?

40:14.079 --> 40:16.014
Just saved you from the
thwacking you probably deserve.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.516
You should thank her, Wade.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.951
Thank you?

40:22.087 --> 40:24.055
I think Tansy
just punched Wade.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.657
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:25.691 --> 40:28.827
Are there other people
here? I didn't notice.

40:29.828 --> 40:32.831

40:40.572 --> 40:42.874
As mayor
of this town,

40:42.908 --> 40:44.943
I'm gonna have to invoke
executive privileges

40:44.976 --> 40:48.113
and insist
that we dance.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.882
I don't think so, Lavon.

40:50.916 --> 40:54.085
It's a long story.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.822
Look, Zoe,
I know about heartache.

40:56.855 --> 40:59.491
And there's gonna be plenty
of time for crying, but...

41:01.527 --> 41:03.829
...it's time for a couple
of friends to dance.

41:05.931 --> 41:07.933
Come on.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.471
