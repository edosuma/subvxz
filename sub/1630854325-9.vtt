WEBVTT

00:21.688 --> 00:24.399
<i>So, three days
and you still haven't caught him.</i>

00:25.442 --> 00:26.860
Thank you. Appreciate it.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.697
Just 'cause I don't want you here
doesn't mean I've forgotten my manners.

00:33.659 --> 00:34.660
He won't come.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.121
I brought Dale up smarter than that.

00:40.499 --> 00:45.254
What I don't get is why he escaped.
You know, my son pled guilty.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.756
I guess he figured prison
just wasn't for him.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.591
Not unusual.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.429
Bruises all over him every time I visited.

00:56.098 --> 00:59.601
Now, you wouldn't know anything
about all that, would you?

01:00.978 --> 01:04.605
Well, he does have a way
of winding people up.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.319
Why do you hate my Dale so much?

01:18.787 --> 01:21.665
I grew up in Otway. You know Otway?

01:21.665 --> 01:22.749
Yeah.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.753
My old man, he's--

01:27.754 --> 01:29.673
He wasn't the smartest fellow, I guess.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.758
Wasn't the biggest.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.928
But he worked harder than anyone. Anyone.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.265
Yeah. Dug coal for 30 years.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.977
And he was determined
that I would never go down in the ground.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.354
No, no, no, no.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.358
I was gonna have the chance
to go to university, just like your Dale.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.403
<i>Make something of myself.</i>

01:52.404 --> 01:55.365
<i>He died at barely 50,</i>

01:56.325 --> 01:58.327
<i>coughing on all the black shit
from his lungs.</i>

01:58.327 --> 02:01.663
Honest work. And it killed him.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.416
I never got to go to university.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.925
So, I hate every little prick

02:12.925 --> 02:15.719
who decides it's too hard for him.

02:15.719 --> 02:19.640
Just gonna rob people or sell junk

02:20.349 --> 02:22.726
and just piss all over
the rest of the world.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.729
Like your Dale.

02:29.525 --> 02:32.694
You know, it breaks my heart,
the thought that I'll never see him again.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.031
But I'll live without a goodbye

02:36.823 --> 02:39.117
if it means he gets to have a life

02:40.494 --> 02:42.955
away from bastards like you.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.289
You'll see him again.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.293
Right back where you saw him last time.
You can be fucking sure of that.

05:03.887 --> 05:07.224
Dr. Lin, I cannot do this.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.976
You are doctor. Not me.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.603
I'm not a doctor. I never have been.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.940
Look, you know pretty much
everything I know at this point, Parvati.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.609
He says that
he has never seen a doctor like you.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.528
You will be a great doctor for Sagar Wada,

05:19.528 --> 05:22.406
and people will come from far and wide
to consult with you.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.992
Any man should be happy
to have such a person for a wife.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.785
Be serious. This is not a joke.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.496
You're a natural, Parvati.
You're good at this.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.583
I am girl. People not listen to me--

05:32.583 --> 05:34.626
If they wanna get better, they'll have to.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.462
Prabhu and Qasim will help you.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.386
I wish you not go.

05:44.970 --> 05:48.432
You'll do fine.
-I don't just mean for the doctoring.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.154
I will need bandage now.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.364
She got you, huh? How's it feel?
-Yes, yes.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.366
I will get you. And I will get you.

06:07.576 --> 06:08.827
Joke, <i>hai</i>?

06:09.661 --> 06:11.705
Joking. Joking.

06:18.462 --> 06:19.463
Oho.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.425
Looks like your Khaderbhai
has kept his promise, huh?

06:24.259 --> 06:26.637
<i>Inshallah</i>, we will have
our own running water soon.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.264
I know you think I set you up.

06:31.308 --> 06:35.103
You did what you thought you had to do,
and I know you did it for us.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.397
But you wish I hadn't.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.817
Hungry men don't care about the past, Lin.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.864
So, is this our goodbye?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.453
Why else would you be teaching Parvati
your medicines?

06:51.453 --> 06:53.539
Or giving all your rations
to your neighbors?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.624
Yeah, I guess it is.

06:56.959 --> 07:00.087
Look, I just wanna say I know
I should have listened to you more, Qasim.

07:00.087 --> 07:04.132
Yes. You and everyone else here
because I am very wise.

07:05.801 --> 07:09.012
And you, Mr. Lin,
you are a big pain in the <i>pichhavaada</i>.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.934
I will miss you all the same.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.074
I told you, he hasn't been here.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.411
And you don't know anything?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.581
Would I be here if I did?

07:38.542 --> 07:41.712
Well, if he hasn't been back here,
then he doesn't have his passport.

07:44.548 --> 07:45.674
So, where is it, huh?

07:54.016 --> 07:55.976
I know you're fucking lying, Lisa.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.498
Move, move. I said, move, move!

08:22.211 --> 08:25.839
Hey, you can't take those. Maurizio.
-You mean this? I can't take this?

08:27.466 --> 08:28.634
No?
-Maurizio, come on.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.093
Listen to me.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.889
I can do whatever the fuck I like.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.557
Okay?

08:36.892 --> 08:40.479
You're smart, Lisa, okay?
Much smarter than him.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.107
Okay? And we can put this right.
All of us, together.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.027
You tell Modena. Okay?

08:47.778 --> 08:51.031
There's still enough time for all three
of us to leave town, but he needs--

08:52.491 --> 08:55.619
he needs to bring me that money, okay?

09:00.332 --> 09:03.460
What are we going to see, Prabhu?
I've got things to do.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.379
The future, Linbaba.

09:07.506 --> 09:08.841
It's Arun's taxi.
-No!

09:10.008 --> 09:12.261
Half the time now, it is my taxi.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.555
He cannot be driving it 24 hours
without sleep.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.640
So, when he is not driving,
I'll be driving,

09:16.640 --> 09:20.018
and he'll be taking very reasonable
percentage of my earnings.

09:20.018 --> 09:23.939
Days, I will be tour guide.
Nights, I will drive passengers.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.566
Hey!
-When do you sleep?

09:26.191 --> 09:27.484
When I'm married.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.613
Now that you are going, I will not be
making much from tour guide business.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.658
So, without you,
I'll be one of the crowd again.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.244
You'll still be,
"number one guide in Bombay."

09:40.581 --> 09:41.707
I've been thinking,

09:42.791 --> 09:45.127
when I get my papers from Didier,

09:45.127 --> 09:47.713
what do you say
you and me take that trip to your village?

09:47.713 --> 09:48.964
Meet your family.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.425
I mean, you said
it's beautiful there, right?

09:51.425 --> 09:54.720
Lin, if I go home,
my father, who's not so modern,

09:54.720 --> 09:57.139
he will hear about my courting Parvati
and want dowry.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.726
Parvati's parents, they're giving me
permission to court her,

10:00.726 --> 10:03.353
but I don't want their mind to change, <i>na</i>?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.564
And so, I want the wedding
to happen very fast.

10:05.564 --> 10:09.401
I will tell Parvati's father
I do not need a dowry. Very modern of me.

10:09.401 --> 10:12.446
He will be happy
to have modern views on this also.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.156
Yeah, I'm sure he will.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.577
You don't think
you're rushing this a little bit, mate?

10:18.577 --> 10:21.496
I mean, you and Parvati haven't really
spent that much time together.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.582
We have years for that
when we are married.

10:23.582 --> 10:27.461
Anyway, tonight is our first
official outing, Linbaba.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.795
No more sneaking.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.674
Lin, this is very tough choice for me.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.801
You are my good friend,
but Parvati, she is--

10:34.801 --> 10:36.261
No, I get it. I get it.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.847
I'm happy for you.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.144
Reynaldo's?
-Yeah.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.438
Actually, no.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.942
You know what,
I've gotta see someone else first.

10:54.738 --> 10:55.906
Who is it?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.200
I'll give you three guesses.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.504
I sat alone for two days in my hut,

11:11.922 --> 11:15.551
then I realized you weren't coming back,
so here I am.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.637
Here you are.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.226
I had something urgent to deal with.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.562
You still dealing with it?

11:26.562 --> 11:28.438
Yes, as it happens.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.524
I have responsibilities, Lin. Same as you.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.608
Not anymore.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.736
I'm leaving tomorrow.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.198
And, so we're clear,

11:39.366 --> 11:40.868
I meant what I said.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.038
And if I knew it meant
you were gonna take off and avoid me,

11:46.164 --> 11:48.792
I would still have said it.
-That's not why I left.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.336
Is it why you never came back?

11:58.468 --> 12:02.014
Anyway, I didn't wanna go
without saying goodbye.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.058
Goodbyes are important.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.187
So this is goodbye, hey?

12:10.606 --> 12:11.899
Forever.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.613
Unless you have dinner with me tonight.
-What? Jesus.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.907
It's my last night in Bombay.
Have dinner with me.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.242
Just like two normal people.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.204
You can even give me
a list of topics not to go near.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.085
I'd like that.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.838
Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.799
You might need to pick a place,
'cause I don't know where to start.

12:47.726 --> 12:48.852
Keep walking.

12:49.353 --> 12:53.190
What the fuck were you thinking,
ripping off Raheem, Zhou?

12:54.233 --> 12:55.609
Maurizio tore up our place.

12:56.735 --> 12:57.903
I was scared, Sebastian.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.781
Maurizio was going to leave you behind,
so fuck him.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.115
I took it all.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.369
Lisa, we can go right now. We can--
-How?

13:05.953 --> 13:08.539
Maurizio took our passports,
so how do we get out, huh?

13:09.164 --> 13:12.918
He'll be watching for us everywhere we go.
They're gonna kill you.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.878
And they're gonna think
I was a part of it.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.464
Lisa, you wanted me to be strong.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.509
Not like this.
You should go before they hurt you.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.052
Lisa, please listen to me.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.389
Lisa, come with me. Please.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.182
I'm sorry, I can't.

13:38.569 --> 13:41.655
All those red notices and not one match.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.867
Maybe Lin Ford is just another <i>gora</i>

13:44.867 --> 13:48.287
hiding in Bombay from some bad debt
or angry wife.

13:48.287 --> 13:51.582
All the best journalists I know
have one thing in common.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.251
Total dogged persistence.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.836
Oh, they do?

13:57.629 --> 14:00.382
What? I'm not saying you don't.
-You don't think I can do it?

14:00.382 --> 14:02.009
What? You've just been humoring me?

14:02.009 --> 14:04.219
There are other things we can do
to identify him.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.810
Lin. How are you?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.104
Can't complain.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.399
I'm Lin.
-This is Nishant.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.194
He's my... boyfriend.
-I'm her friend-- boyfriend.

14:20.194 --> 14:23.030
I'm Kavita's boyfriend.
Pleasure meeting you, Lin.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.032
Yeah, likewise.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.910
I don't suppose you've seen Didier,
have you?

14:27.910 --> 14:29.786
Not for a couple of days.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.038
All right.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.623
Well, see you later.
-See you.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.424
Has Didier been here?

14:42.424 --> 14:44.676
Didier? No.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.237
Hey, it's Lin.

15:08.992 --> 15:09.993
Didier?

15:09.993 --> 15:13.330
Lin. I don't have your passport.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.501
Okay.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.505
What's going on, Didier?

15:26.385 --> 15:29.096
Look, I'm not going anywhere
until you open this door.

15:39.648 --> 15:40.649
Hi.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.362
Have you been out of here
since I last saw you?

15:45.863 --> 15:49.032
Well, one of my neighbors
is happy to bring me food and drink.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.451
I see no reason to leave.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.542
You want your photographs back
and the money to get what you need.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.879
I have both--
I have both, right-- right here.

16:01.879 --> 16:04.298
You haven't got my passport.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.592
Great.

16:50.219 --> 16:54.097
This is dangerous. Why did you come here?

16:54.097 --> 16:56.517
Didi sold my debt to this place.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.727
What could I do, tell them no?

16:59.728 --> 17:01.438
When can you leave?

17:02.898 --> 17:05.233
I'm here until my debt is paid.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.862
You shouldn't have called my office.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.074
What choice did I have?
I didn't know what else to do.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.617
I couldn't understand anything.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.036
I'm not a fool, Akash.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.455
I know our talk of running away,
our life in Canada,

17:19.455 --> 17:21.541
all that dreaming, it wasn't real.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.377
I know I could only ever be
a mistress to you.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.546
But now...

17:26.463 --> 17:32.469
I would like to see if you love me
as much as I love you.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.137
A man in my position--

17:34.137 --> 17:39.309
And it is due to this position Walidbhai
has given you big money for Sagar Wada.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.894
Use the money--

17:40.894 --> 17:43.814
Use the money you got for Sagar Wada
to set me free.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.943
If Walidbhai finds out that you are alive,

17:47.943 --> 17:49.653
his people will kill you.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.738
In either case, I will die here anyway.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.534
Still, you must never speak
of my arrangement with him.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.661
It is not safe for you.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.665
This is best for you.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.086
You, you mean. I am not safe here.

18:09.173 --> 18:12.176
Use Walid's money
to buy me from Madame Zhou.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.469
Talk to her now.

18:16.388 --> 18:19.683
And everything can be just as it was.

18:22.436 --> 18:26.523
Akash? You also want the same, right?

18:32.613 --> 18:36.116
Yes. Yes, of course.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.997
I will do what needs to be done.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.848
Minister Pandey.

19:05.479 --> 19:06.688
Please.

19:15.739 --> 19:19.368
What? Can't you just leave me to drink
and be depressed?

19:20.202 --> 19:23.997
Karla once told me depression only happens
to people who don't know how to be sad.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.127
What the-- does that even fucking mean?

19:29.127 --> 19:32.881
If Karla did less thinking
and more feeling, she'd be better off.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.800
Yeah, can't argue with that.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.302
So, what happened?

19:39.096 --> 19:40.681
Where do I begin?

19:43.225 --> 19:48.272
My father was a wonderful teacher
with one exception. Me.

19:49.606 --> 19:53.902
And my academic failures offended him
to his core.

19:56.655 --> 19:58.991
His hand,
it seemed to me when I was a child,

19:58.991 --> 20:03.328
was so large that when he struck me,
my whole body was bruised.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.289
You know, I lived in terror of those blows

20:05.289 --> 20:09.042
and the feeling of being utterly worthless
that came with it.

20:10.002 --> 20:12.129
So, at 16, I ran away.

20:12.129 --> 20:16.216
Just a young boy with his wits
and a certain degree of charm.

20:19.595 --> 20:22.764
No one has struck me like that since,
not until the other day.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.099
Those cops, it was the same.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.185
They looked at me
and saw nothing of any worth.

20:26.185 --> 20:28.187
Who gives a shit what they think?

20:28.187 --> 20:31.523
Well, they-- Deep down,
I knew they were right.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.072
What are those?

20:42.326 --> 20:43.535
Reminders.

20:45.204 --> 20:49.124
I keep them to remember
what a terrible human being I am.

20:51.335 --> 20:55.214
I had a lover when I was young. In Genova.

20:56.548 --> 20:59.510
A beautiful man inside and out.
He taught me so many things.

20:59.510 --> 21:00.761
Alberto.

21:01.929 --> 21:05.516
Wrote the most beautiful letters to me,
you know.

21:05.516 --> 21:08.894
I was born again in his arms, I think.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.813
So, what happened with Alberto?

21:12.981 --> 21:14.024
Well, he loved me.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.362
I loved him.

21:19.196 --> 21:23.116
But then he made an error of judgment.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.201
He...

21:25.244 --> 21:28.038
decided to test that love.

21:29.331 --> 21:32.960
With all his wisdom,
he didn't know that love can't be tested.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.713
Honesty, yes. Loyalty, for sure.
But not love. You know?

21:36.713 --> 21:38.882
Love goes on forever,

21:38.882 --> 21:41.301
even if we come to hate
the one we love.

21:41.301 --> 21:44.304
You can love someone
and do terrible things to them,

21:44.304 --> 21:46.223
all at the same time.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.267
So, you know,

21:50.018 --> 21:53.897
Alberto allowed me to discover
where he kept his money,

21:53.897 --> 21:57.568
so I took it all, and then-- and ran away.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.613
Love also means he'd have forgiven you.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.827
You never saw him again?

22:09.621 --> 22:11.999
Fifteen years later,
I saw him in the park,

22:13.208 --> 22:14.918
and I hurried past him.

22:15.836 --> 22:16.837
I--

22:18.422 --> 22:21.675
I hurried past that good and brilliant man
who loved me,

22:21.675 --> 22:24.511
simply because he was old
and no longer beautiful.

22:28.265 --> 22:31.268
His weakness, his loneliness,
they terrified me.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.645
I didn't want to be part of it.

22:35.147 --> 22:39.234
And now... now I am him.

22:40.819 --> 22:44.364
When I was in that jail being beaten,
I was back with my father.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.991
Worthless, useless.

22:45.991 --> 22:50.954
It was as if my whole life
has been a mirage.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.834
Only if you stay in this mess.

22:55.834 --> 22:58.086
Whatever you're running from,
you already escaped.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.296
Those cops, they're here.

22:59.296 --> 23:01.381
Every time I walk the street,
it'll be in fear.

23:05.302 --> 23:06.929
I'm a bank robber, Didier.

23:08.639 --> 23:10.140
I escaped jail.

23:11.141 --> 23:13.519
I'm one of the most wanted men
in Australia.

23:15.896 --> 23:18.732
The cop who put me away,
he'd happily see me dead.

23:18.732 --> 23:23.779
Why tell me? Is this like a test?
You know, I fail tests.

23:23.779 --> 23:25.280
No, it's no test.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.450
I just want you to know I understand.

23:29.535 --> 23:32.538
I wake up every day
and I still think they're coming for me.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.667
The fear doesn't go away,
whether you stay in here or not.

23:39.378 --> 23:40.838
But every day we're free

23:42.005 --> 23:44.591
is a kick in the balls to those bastards.

23:58.647 --> 23:59.690
Barry,

24:00.983 --> 24:02.860
you know I don't like bad news.

24:09.908 --> 24:12.369
It's a match. Today's the day, Sarge.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.496
Bring it.

24:46.028 --> 24:49.323
Charlie. Charlie Pendergast,
he gave me the gun.

24:49.323 --> 24:52.659
He didn't give it to me, but that's his.
I too-- I borrowed it.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.453
Truth be told, he didn't give it to me.

24:54.453 --> 24:56.705
I took it without him knowing,
but that's his gun.

24:56.705 --> 24:59.708
Charlie Pendergast, you say.
-I promise you.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.886
We have photos and recordings

25:11.470 --> 25:14.223
from today and from your time
at Khandala with Sunita.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.559
Your life will be over,

25:17.559 --> 25:21.271
your reputation ruined,
and your wife and children disgraced.

25:22.856 --> 25:25.067
But we're not your enemies, Minister.

25:25.067 --> 25:27.569
We ask only for you to listen
to the will of the people.

25:29.780 --> 25:33.492
If their votes are in favor of
Khader Khan, so be it.

25:33.492 --> 25:37.621
If Walid does not win the slums,
he'll kill me like he killed Rujul.

25:37.621 --> 25:41.750
Walid did not kill Rujul.
He died for betraying Khader Khan.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.170
And what about Sunita?

25:45.754 --> 25:47.965
If you deny us,
what do you think happens to her?

25:48.757 --> 25:50.968
She says you love her.
-I do.

25:50.968 --> 25:54.263
It would be so much easier
if I did not love her.

25:54.972 --> 25:56.890
But I love my family as well.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.852
I'm a man of position and status.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.938
My wife's family are well-respected.

26:03.522 --> 26:05.983
Sunita is just a Kamathipura <i>ran</i>.

26:09.278 --> 26:10.904
I was stupid

26:12.030 --> 26:13.740
to think that I could have her.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.743
You want everything your own way
with no consequences.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.203
Of course I do.

26:18.912 --> 26:20.622
Then trust Khaderbhai.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.048
I'll-- I'll do it.

26:31.967 --> 26:36.388
Then we'll keep your secrets.
And Sunita can be freed today.

26:39.892 --> 26:41.101
Maybe...

26:42.269 --> 26:44.229
Maybe it is better
if she were to stay here.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.399
You're going to leave her behind?

26:47.399 --> 26:51.278
You brought her here, not me.

26:56.283 --> 26:58.994
It seems all roads lead to Sagar Wada.

27:02.289 --> 27:04.708
If anyone learns about Minister Pandey,

27:04.708 --> 27:07.294
we'll assume you told,
and Khader will have you killed.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.590
"We." "Khader."

27:12.466 --> 27:13.592
You, you mean.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.975
<i>I watched Didier's fear that day,</i>

27:21.975 --> 27:25.562
<i>knowing too well what it was
to feel hunted and scared,</i>

27:25.562 --> 27:31.527
<i>but also knowing the only way through it
is to say, "Fuck it," take a chance.</i>

27:32.736 --> 27:35.864
Are they following or what?
-No, no. You're good. You're good.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.247
Ready for this?
-It's the cops.

27:43.914 --> 27:45.123
After you.

27:50.671 --> 27:51.797
Hey, boss!

27:52.506 --> 27:54.508
Didier, my friend, welcome back.
-Good to see you.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.886
Hey!
-Good to see you. How are you?

27:57.886 --> 28:01.056
Yeah, sorry. I was gone for a while,
but I'm back, yes. Yeah. Yeah.

28:01.056 --> 28:02.724
Yeah, yeah. No, we're good.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.393
Hey, hey.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.228
<i>Namaste, namaste</i>. I'm good.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.483
You might not want friends,
but you've got some anyway.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.360
Yeah, one real one, at least.

28:16.488 --> 28:17.906
Whiskey and beer.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.202
I guess we should sit.

28:22.202 --> 28:24.329
It's the act of a barbarian
to drink standing.

28:24.329 --> 28:26.206
Hey.
-I need a piss.

28:36.133 --> 28:38.218
Hey, Maurizio.

28:40.596 --> 28:41.763
Where have you been?

28:42.264 --> 28:45.225
I had some personal business
to attend to.

28:46.602 --> 28:48.353
Has Modena contacted you?

28:49.188 --> 28:52.566
No, what would he want with me,
you know? I mean...

28:52.566 --> 28:53.901
Passports.

28:56.486 --> 28:59.698
If he does, leave word for me at the bar
or contact me on this number.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.827
I assume he's not to know
about your interest in his welfare?

29:04.453 --> 29:05.454
No.

29:08.123 --> 29:09.541
You're in my seat.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.340
You think I don't know what you did?

29:16.340 --> 29:17.966
Then you know more than me.

29:17.966 --> 29:20.093
But if it pissed you off, then I'm happy.

29:22.513 --> 29:24.556
You'll get yours soon enough.

29:33.273 --> 29:34.483
What was that about?

29:37.694 --> 29:39.696
I haven't a clue.
-Crazy.

29:41.448 --> 29:42.491
Cheers.

29:49.039 --> 29:50.249
How did it go?

29:50.249 --> 29:52.459
Pandey gave it up faster
than a 50-rupee <i>randi</i>.

29:53.043 --> 29:54.711
Karla crushed his balls in her hands.

29:54.711 --> 29:56.255
Good. This is great news.

29:56.797 --> 29:57.798
Karla?

30:00.425 --> 30:01.760
Job's done.

30:08.433 --> 30:10.644
Pandey must really love this woman.

30:11.228 --> 30:13.647
Pandey's scared Walid will kill him
when he finds out.

30:13.647 --> 30:14.773
He might.

30:14.773 --> 30:16.483
But by then, it will be too late.

30:16.483 --> 30:18.485
How I wish I could be a fly on the wall

30:18.485 --> 30:21.613
just to see Walid's face
when he hears the news.

30:22.322 --> 30:25.701
Is this what this is about?
-No, but punishing his disrespect,

30:25.701 --> 30:28.871
that is a bonus I will not deny enjoying.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.874
Karla, I know this wasn't easy for you.

30:31.874 --> 30:33.917
Not as hard as it was on Sunita.

30:34.459 --> 30:35.919
You feel for her.

30:35.919 --> 30:40.090
She loves Pandey and asked nothing
but to be loved in return.

30:40.090 --> 30:43.427
We manipulated that,
and then Pandey threw it in her face.

30:43.427 --> 30:45.804
So now she knows not to trust politicians.

30:45.804 --> 30:48.557
I thought this was meant to be
a celebration. We won.

30:48.557 --> 30:50.767
Enjoy it. It won't happen every time.

30:54.646 --> 30:58.317
I'm going to leave you two to...
whatever this is turning into.

30:58.317 --> 30:59.401
Karla.

31:00.652 --> 31:05.282
Tell me, what can I do
to give you your happiness back?

31:07.951 --> 31:10.120
I want to give Sunita her freedom

31:10.746 --> 31:12.915
and enough money
to choose what to do with it.

31:12.915 --> 31:15.918
Of course. But what do you need?

31:18.837 --> 31:21.006
Hey. I'm not gonna need these.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.301
You can keep 'em or share 'em out.

31:25.427 --> 31:27.304
Which one you think I should be wearing?

31:27.804 --> 31:28.931
This one?

31:30.349 --> 31:31.433
Or this one maybe?

31:32.434 --> 31:33.727
That one.

31:33.727 --> 31:35.812
I was thinking this one.

31:35.812 --> 31:38.065
Shit, <i>yaar</i>, I am very nervous, Linbaba.

31:38.065 --> 31:39.942
It was much easier when we were sneaking.

31:40.651 --> 31:42.736
It's good to be nervous.
It means it matters.

31:43.779 --> 31:45.155
I'm nervous too.

31:46.365 --> 31:47.783
Why are you nervous?

31:47.783 --> 31:51.161
And I'm confused why you're spending money
on such a dinner with Karla Ma'am

31:51.161 --> 31:52.496
when you're leaving anyway.

31:53.830 --> 31:57.042
You're going to ask her to go with you?
That is your plan?

31:58.836 --> 32:02.714
I like it, Linbaba. Much better
than sharing a village hut with...

32:05.592 --> 32:08.303
<i>Arre</i>, hero!

32:08.303 --> 32:10.556
How can they not be loving us? Huh?

32:10.556 --> 32:13.016
Look at us! We're handsome.

32:13.809 --> 32:16.937
You can borrow my other good shirt
if you like.

32:17.938 --> 32:19.022
No, I got it covered.

32:19.982 --> 32:24.027
<i>Achcha</i>, I have one question
I must ask you.

32:26.154 --> 32:27.990
Most serious.
-What do you need?

32:30.701 --> 32:35.873
If you'll be bringing Karla Ma'am
here tonight for sexy time,

32:35.873 --> 32:39.168
can I watch so I can learn best things
to do while making sex?

32:45.382 --> 32:46.717
I got you, <i>na</i>?

32:47.259 --> 32:48.594
I got you! Tell me.

33:07.237 --> 33:09.323
Why didn't you just leave with Modena?

33:12.826 --> 33:14.828
Maurizio scared the hell out of me.

33:16.205 --> 33:18.749
The whole thing was just too much.

33:23.504 --> 33:26.173
Modena did all that
to prove that he loves me.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.259
I threw it back in his face.

33:30.093 --> 33:32.054
He'd be crazy to stick around.

33:34.806 --> 33:36.808
I wish you'd come to me first.

33:37.935 --> 33:41.230
I could have arranged
passports and papers for you both.

33:44.149 --> 33:45.651
I'm scared, Karla.

33:47.152 --> 33:49.821
I don't wanna go back to his place.
-Then stay here.

33:52.491 --> 33:53.700
Are you all right?

33:54.409 --> 33:55.702
I don't know.

33:57.579 --> 33:59.248
I really fucking don't.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.179
Madame Zhou admitted to my face
that she killed Ahmed.

34:14.972 --> 34:17.306
Said it like she expected me
to understand it.

34:17.306 --> 34:20.143
Madame Zhou's a fucking monster.
-And what am I?

34:28.110 --> 34:30.237
When I went to Sagar Wada to see Lin,

34:32.030 --> 34:33.614
he almost died of cholera.

34:34.324 --> 34:35.993
And I was jealous.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.621
He knew what it was for. It was worth it.

34:45.210 --> 34:46.962
He told me he loves me.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.130
And what'd you say?

34:50.257 --> 34:51.466
No. Let me guess.

34:52.759 --> 34:56.263
You told him you don't believe in love.
-And then I ran away.

34:58.348 --> 35:00.475
Maybe he's the answer
to what you need, Karla.

35:04.062 --> 35:08.901
I've lied to him right from the start
about Rujul, Khader, all of it.

35:10.819 --> 35:12.154
He deserves better.

35:15.199 --> 35:17.451
Maybe you should let him decide that
for himself.

36:22.099 --> 36:23.100
Okay.

36:25.227 --> 36:27.855
Okay. I know what you're thinking,
and I don't blame--

36:27.855 --> 36:31.441
I was thinking about how long
it would take you to hit the ground

36:31.441 --> 36:33.360
after we throw you through this window.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.280
Hey, my supplier fucked us both. Okay?

36:37.948 --> 36:40.659
When I gave him your money this time,
he disappeared.

36:41.368 --> 36:43.453
I've been looking for him,
but I haven't found him yet.

36:43.453 --> 36:45.581
Is that why you have been
packing up to leave?

36:45.581 --> 36:47.249
You think I'm stupid, huh?

36:48.041 --> 36:49.501
Open the window.

36:49.501 --> 36:52.713
Look, I swear to you,
it's the truth, okay? It's the truth.

36:54.047 --> 36:56.508
Look, Raheem, if I had your money,
would I still be here?

36:59.094 --> 37:00.846
What is his name, your supplier?

37:02.931 --> 37:04.558
Look, I'm gonna find him. I promise.

37:06.977 --> 37:11.648
No! No, no, no, no. No, no.

37:11.648 --> 37:13.358
No, Raheem. No!

37:13.358 --> 37:15.569
Lin. Lin Ford. Lin Ford. Lin Ford.

37:15.569 --> 37:20.032
Lin Ford. His name is Lin Ford. Okay?

37:20.616 --> 37:22.159
He usually hangs out at Reynaldo's.

37:22.743 --> 37:25.287
I haven't seen him since
I gave him the money. But when I do--

37:25.287 --> 37:28.624
I'm gonna find him. And when I do,
I'm gonna come to get you at your hotel.

37:28.624 --> 37:31.126
Because we are such good friends,
you and I, huh?

37:32.711 --> 37:34.213
You look tired, Maurizio.

37:34.213 --> 37:37.299
All this looking you've done already.
You rest, hmm?

37:38.175 --> 37:39.968
We'll go to find this Lin Ford.

37:41.470 --> 37:43.222
Let's go.
-Look-- Wait.

37:43.222 --> 37:45.265
He doesn't leave this place...
-I know people--

37:45.265 --> 37:47.476
...until I say so.
-You need me out there! Raheem!

37:47.476 --> 37:49.520
If he tries, break his legs.
-Raheem!

37:50.103 --> 37:51.813
Okay. Okay.

38:11.333 --> 38:13.043
My friend.

38:13.043 --> 38:15.796
My friend, come over here, quickly.

38:15.796 --> 38:19.174
We are hungry. Hurry up. Come here!

38:19.174 --> 38:21.176
What will you be having, Auntie?

38:21.176 --> 38:22.678
Have whatever you want, Auntie.

38:25.514 --> 38:27.599
Pattice and samosa looks good, huh?

38:27.599 --> 38:29.643
Yes, give her one pattice.

38:36.233 --> 38:39.403
I am also liking candied peanuts, Prabhu.
Very delicious.

38:39.403 --> 38:43.323
Oh, yes, my friend, candied peanuts.
We must have everything.

38:58.338 --> 39:00.090
Thank you. Thank you.

39:32.539 --> 39:33.540
Thank you.

39:42.591 --> 39:46.678
<i>Sitting there, I felt like maybe
I could have what I wanted after all,</i>

39:47.638 --> 39:50.432
<i>that I'd earned some freedom
and a future worth having,</i>

39:51.642 --> 39:53.227
<i>one with Karla in it.</i>

40:01.151 --> 40:02.778
You look pretty special.

40:02.778 --> 40:04.279
Scrub up well yourself.

40:05.197 --> 40:06.907
It's all right, mate. I got it. Thank you.

40:06.907 --> 40:08.116
Yes, sir.

40:08.116 --> 40:10.619
Nothing to see here.

40:10.619 --> 40:13.038
Nothing happened.

40:14.039 --> 40:15.249
Smooth as silk.

40:18.961 --> 40:20.295
There we go.

40:33.141 --> 40:34.309
Charlie.

40:34.309 --> 40:36.895
Charlie! There's someone in the yard.
-What? What?

40:37.729 --> 40:38.730
Listen to me.

40:51.827 --> 40:52.870
Who's out there, eh?

40:52.870 --> 40:55.205
Senior Detective Walter Nightingale,

40:55.205 --> 40:57.165
Australian Federal Police, mate.

40:57.165 --> 41:00.502
Fuck! Get rid of that shit.
-We just wanna have a chat, that's all.

41:02.296 --> 41:06.508
Charlie, listen to me.
We're gonna come in now.

41:17.102 --> 41:19.730
Stop your fucking crying, Missy!
Get rid of that shit, will you?

41:19.730 --> 41:20.939
Missy, move!

41:24.359 --> 41:25.360
Shit.

41:28.780 --> 41:31.074
Round the back. Stay low, stay low.

41:32.034 --> 41:33.076
Oh, shit. Fuck.

41:33.702 --> 41:34.703
Fuck.

41:37.956 --> 41:40.125
Charlie, they're coming round back!

41:40.959 --> 41:42.544
No you don't, you bastards.

41:51.512 --> 41:53.555
Fuck! Fuck!

41:59.102 --> 42:01.355
Holy fuck! All right!

42:01.355 --> 42:03.524
All right! I'm done!

42:03.524 --> 42:07.027
Hey, everyone, hold your fire!

42:07.986 --> 42:10.697
Hold your fire!
-I'm coming out, all right?

42:10.697 --> 42:11.782
Hold your fire.

42:11.782 --> 42:13.992
Lay down on the floor for me, will you?

42:13.992 --> 42:16.870
No, no, no.
-Lay down on the floor for me, will you?

42:16.870 --> 42:18.413
It's okay. I love you.

42:20.332 --> 42:21.750
All right!

42:21.750 --> 42:25.045
All right. I'm coming out. Don't shoot me.

42:25.045 --> 42:26.296
You hear me?

42:28.674 --> 42:29.675
I love you.

42:37.015 --> 42:38.183
See my gun?

42:39.852 --> 42:43.188
Gun on top of the car. All right?

42:47.609 --> 42:49.236
Just a chat, mate.

42:51.029 --> 42:54.116
Charlie, you wanna put the gun down, mate?

43:00.163 --> 43:04.877
Fuck! Fuck! Jesus! Fuck!

43:13.802 --> 43:17.514
I think--
I think you shot me, you bastard.

43:19.474 --> 43:21.435
Call me an ambulance.
-I will. I will.

43:21.435 --> 43:24.396
Listen, I just-- I just need to know.

43:24.396 --> 43:25.480
Yeah?

43:25.480 --> 43:26.565
The bank robbery...

43:26.565 --> 43:29.276
Yeah?
-Did you shoot at Officer Floris?

43:29.276 --> 43:31.361
Yeah. That was me.

43:31.361 --> 43:34.531
Now get me some help. Get me some help.

43:34.531 --> 43:36.408
Where's Dale Conti?
-Dale?

43:36.408 --> 43:39.369
Where's Dale Conti? No, no, no, no.

43:39.369 --> 43:41.580
You feel that? Can you feel that?

43:46.460 --> 43:47.294
Yeah?

43:52.257 --> 43:55.719
Listen, listen, listen. Listen, listen.

43:55.719 --> 43:56.803
You're dying.

43:56.803 --> 43:58.263
You're fucking dying

43:58.263 --> 44:01.099
and I'm the only thing
that's gonna stop it, okay?

44:01.099 --> 44:02.434
So, just tell me.

44:02.434 --> 44:04.311
Just tell me. Where is he?

44:05.729 --> 44:07.397
You couldn't make Dale talk.

44:09.107 --> 44:10.734
That gave you the shits, hey?

44:14.863 --> 44:18.534
Okay, okay. If I keep quiet,
who wins then?

44:23.789 --> 44:27.543
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

44:31.004 --> 44:33.715
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

44:35.634 --> 44:37.344
Such is life.

44:41.014 --> 44:42.850
Fuck face.

44:59.199 --> 45:01.034
Straight face, he looks at me-- Thank you.

45:01.034 --> 45:02.828
And says, "Do you mind if I watch

45:02.828 --> 45:05.789
so I can learn the best things to do
while sex making?"

45:07.082 --> 45:08.083
I believed him.

45:09.710 --> 45:11.420
I swear, he acts like such a clown,

45:11.420 --> 45:15.007
but he is the most decent, smartest man
I've ever met.

45:15.007 --> 45:16.300
I fucking love him.

45:18.468 --> 45:19.469
All of them.

45:26.894 --> 45:28.645
It's just the wine.
-Of course.

45:30.647 --> 45:32.566
Maybe you only told me that Prabhu story

45:32.566 --> 45:37.529
to cleverly raise the subject of sexy time
on your last night in Bombay.

45:40.949 --> 45:42.409
You're as bad as he is.

45:43.160 --> 45:48.540
Unless you're only raising me raising it
for your own sexy-time purposes.

45:53.504 --> 45:54.505
Relax.

45:55.506 --> 45:57.633
No, even if you're asking--

45:59.218 --> 46:00.427
I'm not saying you are--

46:00.427 --> 46:02.513
I don't think I could do that
and still leave.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.058
And I do have to leave.

46:07.601 --> 46:09.102
You shouldn't have to go.

46:11.313 --> 46:12.523
Come with me.

46:13.857 --> 46:17.110
Hey. No promises, no guarantees.

46:17.110 --> 46:21.740
Just you and me together
for as long as it feels good.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.954
That why you asked me here?
-Yeah.

46:26.954 --> 46:30.290
To do just this, to laugh, talk.

46:30.290 --> 46:32.626
See how fucking easy it is,
how good it feels.

46:35.462 --> 46:37.756
I hate the idea of not seeing you again.

46:39.550 --> 46:41.927
I don't wanna go
because I'm in love with you.

46:48.392 --> 46:50.394
Things aren't that simple, Lin.

46:50.394 --> 46:51.603
They could be.

46:53.730 --> 46:55.232
I mean, what's keeping you here?

46:55.983 --> 46:58.193
What's so important
that it wouldn't be still here

46:58.193 --> 47:00.153
if you decided to come back?

47:00.654 --> 47:02.072
Look, I might be wrong, Karla,

47:02.072 --> 47:04.324
but you look a lot like someone
you once described

47:04.324 --> 47:07.786
as sitting alone in a sinking lifeboat
too scared to get out.

47:07.786 --> 47:10.372
Maybe I don't wanna
take anyone else down with me.

47:11.248 --> 47:12.791
I'm a great fucking swimmer.

47:17.921 --> 47:19.047
I can't.
-You could.

47:29.641 --> 47:31.185
I'll miss you, Lin.

47:32.311 --> 47:33.312
A lot.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.488
<i>If I'd have gone after her,</i>

47:43.488 --> 47:46.366
<i>would she have changed her mind,
said yes to coming with me?</i>

47:46.992 --> 47:48.577
<i>I'll never know.</i>

47:48.577 --> 47:51.872
<i>I only know how different
everything that came after would've been.</i>

48:05.469 --> 48:06.637
Are you Didier Levy?

48:08.472 --> 48:10.349
You have me at a disadvantage.

48:10.349 --> 48:12.768
I heard you are friends with Lin Ford.

48:12.768 --> 48:14.978
I need to find him.
We have business together.

48:17.731 --> 48:21.527
Lin, yes. Well, he hasn't been around
for some time.

48:21.527 --> 48:25.405
Last I heard, he had
a rather beautiful Swedish woman

48:25.405 --> 48:27.658
in a suite at the Taj hotel.

48:27.658 --> 48:31.245
And they had plans
to visit Varanasi, I believe.

48:31.245 --> 48:33.455
But you may have missed him already.

48:33.455 --> 48:35.499
But I'll be happy to assist you
in your business--

48:35.499 --> 48:36.583
You can't.

48:46.969 --> 48:49.096
Lisa. It's me, Sebastian.

48:52.224 --> 48:54.810
Sebastian, what are you doing here?
It's dangerous.

48:54.810 --> 48:56.270
I made sure I wasn't followed.

49:01.733 --> 49:03.026
I thought you were gone.

49:06.530 --> 49:07.823
You should have gone.

49:07.823 --> 49:09.283
I won't go without you.

49:11.368 --> 49:13.161
<i>Te amo</i>, Lisa.

49:16.540 --> 49:17.666
I'm sorry.

49:18.834 --> 49:22.754
I'm so sorry for what I said earlier.
I wanna come with you.

49:22.754 --> 49:25.382
Karla's offered to help.
She can get us new travel papers.

49:27.426 --> 49:28.802
It's going to work.

49:33.515 --> 49:34.516
Hey.

49:36.560 --> 49:40.314
Go to Sagar Wada and find
the <i>gora</i> doctor, Linbaba. Okay?

49:40.314 --> 49:43.609
Tell him Didier says to stay there
and not leave the slum.

49:43.609 --> 49:47.696
If he isn't there, you must find Prabhu
and tell Prabhu to come here to see me.

49:47.696 --> 49:50.032
Okay? Just go. Go, go, go. Go, go.
-Okay.

49:55.495 --> 49:57.789
Hey, if you don't let me go,
I'm gonna piss myself.

50:23.148 --> 50:26.401
Any tricks, and I break your legs.

50:37.788 --> 50:39.957
I'm right out there. Hurry up.

51:17.119 --> 51:19.329
Are you still writing a story on Lin?

51:21.707 --> 51:22.708
He knows?

51:25.586 --> 51:27.004
Did he send you here?

51:27.004 --> 51:28.881
I came here to ask you to stop.

51:35.637 --> 51:38.891
Lindsay Ford is the name of a dead man.

51:38.891 --> 51:40.225
Did you know that already?

51:40.225 --> 51:41.977
Who Lin was doesn't matter.

51:41.977 --> 51:45.689
What matters is who he is now,
the work he's doing in Sagar Wada.

51:46.565 --> 51:48.984
If you publish your story,
he'll have to leave Bombay.

51:48.984 --> 51:50.736
He doesn't deserve that.

51:53.238 --> 51:56.408
Plenty of us deserve to be punished
for the shit we've done,

51:56.408 --> 51:57.826
but Lin isn't one of them.

52:01.496 --> 52:03.332
What is it that you do, Karla?

52:03.332 --> 52:06.793
I mean, we hang out in Reynaldo's
and we all have fun.

52:07.336 --> 52:12.132
We are friendly,
but we're not really friends, as such.

52:16.553 --> 52:20.724
Look, I like Lin, okay?
But this is what I do.

52:21.308 --> 52:24.770
I'm a journalist. And Lin's a story.

52:27.523 --> 52:29.358
I make deals happen that shouldn't.

52:33.237 --> 52:36.573
If you drop that story on Lin,
I'll give you a better one.

52:38.492 --> 52:39.493
What is it?

52:40.619 --> 52:44.790
Corruption, bribery, sex, and murders.

52:49.294 --> 52:53.715
I can give you a story on how
a Bombay gangster is using them all

52:53.715 --> 52:56.260
to try and get his hands on
the Sagar Wada slums.

52:57.845 --> 52:59.012
All right.

52:59.805 --> 53:00.806
I'm listening.

53:02.140 --> 53:05.185
First, I need your word
that you'll walk away from Lin.

53:05.894 --> 53:09.439
Whatever happens,
he gets to stay in Bombay.

53:16.989 --> 53:17.990
Come inside.

53:36.550 --> 53:38.218
No, I'm all right. I'm all right.

53:48.395 --> 53:49.938
I'm sorry I shot him, Sarge.

53:50.772 --> 53:53.650
So am I, Son. So am I.

53:55.903 --> 53:58.280
Still, we made
a good collar tonight, right?

53:58.280 --> 54:00.657
Well, it's a result, either way.

54:01.700 --> 54:04.286
Tonight was a fucking shambles.

54:05.829 --> 54:09.458
Cops killing fellas like that
turn them into heroes for other scumbags.

54:11.543 --> 54:15.923
And now Pendergast can't
tell us where the little bastard is.

54:16.924 --> 54:17.925
And I don't know--

54:17.925 --> 54:20.719
That's a fucking result,
somehow in your small mind.

54:43.075 --> 54:45.994
This a fucking wind-up?

55:04.805 --> 55:07.641
Don't tell me you're leaving.
I need someone to get drunk with.

55:07.641 --> 55:09.810
Lin, we're both leaving.

55:09.810 --> 55:11.979
Mate, I just got here.
I'm gonna get shit-faced.

55:11.979 --> 55:14.481
Lin, <i>on y va</i>.
We can have a drink at my place.

55:24.575 --> 55:26.910
Did something happen?
-I'll explain later.

55:33.667 --> 55:36.170
What's going on?
-I'm in a little trouble.

55:36.170 --> 55:38.380
I need your help but elsewhere.

55:38.380 --> 55:40.048
Now, let's go.
-More trouble?

55:40.048 --> 55:42.801
I left you alone for six hours.
What's going on?

55:44.178 --> 55:45.179
Let's move on.

55:59.276 --> 56:01.445
Is he following you?
-Move on. Move on. Move on.

56:04.156 --> 56:05.157
Come.

56:15.626 --> 56:18.045
What do you want?
Why the fuck are you following him?

56:18.045 --> 56:20.839
Leave me-- Leave me--
-Why the fuck--

56:21.715 --> 56:23.717
Why are you following him?
-Not me. You.

56:23.717 --> 56:26.178
He's following you, Lin!
-Why you fucking following him?

56:26.178 --> 56:27.804
And there'll be others!

56:40.526 --> 56:41.735
What's going on?

56:42.694 --> 56:44.112
What have you done, Linbaba?

56:45.697 --> 56:46.698
What have I done?

56:49.117 --> 56:50.494
Jesus Christ.
