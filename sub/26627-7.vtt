00:34.492 --> 00:37.120
[Fisk] The painting that's intended
for this wall

00:37.954 --> 00:40.498
is something I am specially attached to.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.668
[Lee] Of course. <i>Rabbit in a Snowstorm.</i>

00:43.752 --> 00:45.587
Yes, the agreement.

00:46.546 --> 00:51.051
It said I was to get
all my belongings restored to me.

00:51.134 --> 00:55.764
Precisely. And we might be able
to use this violation of terms

00:55.847 --> 00:57.682
to lobby the feds for something else.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.100
The painting!

01:02.645 --> 01:04.522
That's what I'm interested in.

01:05.231 --> 01:09.611
I can assure you we're doing
everything in our power, but...

01:09.694 --> 01:12.572
there's a challenge
to your ownership claim.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.836
It comes home.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.089
Do you understand?

01:46.147 --> 01:47.941
Lawyer's out! Cameras back on!

01:56.741 --> 01:59.244
[agent over radio]<i> Wellers,</i>
<i>we have a situation. Report to the CP.</i>

02:00.328 --> 02:01.412
[Wellers] Shit.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.750
Inside. Shut the door.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.514
[Fisk] Show them to me.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.560
[typing]

04:30.520 --> 04:32.605
[woman over radio] <i>All units</i>
<i>on the citywide, NYPD...</i>

04:32.689 --> 04:34.440
[radio chatter continues indistinctly]

04:36.109 --> 04:39.612
[Doyle] <i>Shit. Are you hearing this?</i>
<i>What happened at the </i>Bulletin?

04:39.696 --> 04:43.241
<i>We should be there,</i>
<i>not stuck here with this asshole.</i>

04:43.324 --> 04:44.409
<i>He go to bed?</i>

04:44.492 --> 04:48.037
[Doyle] <i>Turned in early.</i>
<i>Nice and cozy, while the world explodes.</i>

04:48.121 --> 04:50.623
And now the news, Mrs. Shelby.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.169
<i>...rushed to nearby hospitals</i>
<i>in critical condition.</i>

04:55.253 --> 04:59.090
<i>But what we do know is that,</i>
<i>according to several eyewitnesses,</i>

04:59.173 --> 05:01.592
<i>the brutal attack on the </i>Bulletin<i> staff</i>

05:01.676 --> 05:05.054
<i>has been carried out</i>
<i>by none other than Daredevil.</i>

05:05.638 --> 05:08.599
<i>The word from the witnesses</i>
<i>we've spoken with is that Daredevil,</i>

05:08.683 --> 05:11.394
<i>Hell's Kitchen's renowned vigilante,</i>
<i>is the perpetrator.</i>

05:11.477 --> 05:14.147
<i>...they don't know the whereabouts</i>
<i>of Daredevil or whether...</i>

05:14.230 --> 05:19.402
<i>This brutal act hits Hell's Kitchen after</i>
<i>a period of relative calm in the city,</i>

05:19.485 --> 05:22.030
<i>with the FBI arresting</i>
<i>many of New York's...</i>

05:26.576 --> 05:28.578
[theme music playing]

06:33.309 --> 06:36.104
You're missing the point. He didn't
just find someone to wear my suit.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.440
Someone as fast and skilled as I've
ever seen, and I couldn't take him.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.901
-He found someone to kill me.
-Matthew...

06:41.984 --> 06:44.529
I was stupid enough to think
that I had Fisk cornered.

06:44.612 --> 06:48.199
He knew I'd find the witness,
and I just brought the sheep to slaughter.

06:48.282 --> 06:49.534
Jasper Evans is dead.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.286
He's dead and he leaves a son behind,
and that's on me!

06:53.037 --> 06:56.666
I was so sure that I finally
was out in front of this bastard.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.251
And Fisk, he knew I thought that.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.710
-He was waiting for me.
-Matthew--

06:59.794 --> 07:01.629
Foggy and Karen both could've been killed.

07:01.712 --> 07:05.508
And there would have been nothing
I could have done to stop it. Nothing.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.636
You're losing blood.
I need to stitch you up.

07:08.719 --> 07:12.348
I listened to you.
I listened to you, and they almost died.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.227
God damn it. I'm such an idiot.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.188
No.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.984
I'm the idiot.

07:23.860 --> 07:28.030
I told you to involve your friends,
and I made things worse.

07:31.993 --> 07:36.372
I'm used to putting on a brave face when
people bring their troubles to the church.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.376
And I find that they
don't just bring their troubles,

07:40.460 --> 07:43.880
they bring their answers, too,
if you let them talk enough.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.756
But...

07:46.883 --> 07:52.472
what you're dealing with
is so far beyond my experience that...

07:56.350 --> 07:57.518
Well...

07:58.561 --> 08:03.483
all I can hope to do is help keep
your wounds stitched and your head clear,

08:03.566 --> 08:05.443
so you can be safe.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.823
And I'll be more careful
about giving advice to the Devil.

08:12.158 --> 08:17.413
And, occasionally, possibly,
I'll try to keep my mouth shut.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.165
Could I get that in writing?

08:22.001 --> 08:24.128
Look, I know you were just trying to help.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.840
Now, can I please see to those wounds?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.562
[exhales]

08:53.908 --> 08:55.493
Can I ask you something?

08:56.077 --> 08:57.119
Yeah.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.747
[breathes heavily]

08:59.830 --> 09:04.752
What if you stopped this fight,
took time to heal...

09:05.294 --> 09:08.256
and let other people like you
go after Fisk?

09:11.467 --> 09:13.010
This isn't their fight.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.389
Fisk is my problem.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.729
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

09:26.190 --> 09:30.403
The problem is,
he's always five steps ahead of me.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.282
I don't know if I can beat him.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.328
And I don't know if I can beat
the man he sent to kill me.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.708
You won't know for certain
till you find him.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.171
I thought you were gonna keep
your thoughts to yourself.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.342
-You really want me to do that?
-[chuckles softly] No.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.433
If he was wearing
a copy of your Devil suit...

10:00.516 --> 10:02.810
Well, he didn't get it at Sears.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.771
How good a copy was it?

10:11.235 --> 10:12.695
It was perfect.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.408
-[Karen panting on TV]
-[gunshot on TV]

10:22.538 --> 10:25.249
[Dex] <i>Hello, Karen.</i>
<i>It's nice to see you again.</i>

10:30.004 --> 10:32.882
Was there anyone else
in the room named Karen?

10:33.507 --> 10:35.635
Or on the whole <i>Bulletin</i> staff?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.262
I'm advising my client
not to answer any questions

10:38.346 --> 10:39.972
that treat her like an asshole.

10:40.723 --> 10:44.060
[Ray] There was not.
He was talking to you.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.565
-Why don't we watch it again? See--
-No.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.819
-He was talking to me. That's true.
-[Ray] Okay.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.530
-Good.
-[Karen] But I've never met him before.

10:58.699 --> 11:03.704
Well, according to your own newspaper,
you've met Daredevil at least twice.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.289
That psycho's not Daredevil.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.166
I got a pretty good look at him, too.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.834
Could have fooled me.

11:08.918 --> 11:13.631
Do you think every fat guy with
a white beard and red suit is Santa Claus?

11:13.714 --> 11:16.425
If he comes down my chimney
and leaves presents under the tree.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.762
Exactly. If he acted like Santa.
This guy doesn't act like Daredevil.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.430
Based on your two encounters?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.100
Dig a little deeper.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.352
Why don't you read everything?

11:26.977 --> 11:29.772
He doesn't kill people, ever.
It's not Daredevil.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.440
So you keep saying.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.568
Did you ever look into Felix Manning?
Red Lion Bank?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.696
Any of the leads
that I dropped in your lap?

11:38.322 --> 11:39.699
They're on my to-do list.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.326
This is bullshit.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.747
He dropped your name, Ms. Page.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.083
Used your gun to murder someone.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.584
And in this entire shitshow,

11:50.668 --> 11:53.421
you're the one person
he didn't lay a finger on.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.674
So I'm sorry that you think
that this is bullshit,

11:56.757 --> 11:58.467
but something doesn't add up.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.803
So we're gonna keep
going over this until it does.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.014
It's not gonna add up until you start
asking the right questions.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.975
How about this one? Where's Matt Murdock?

12:06.684 --> 12:09.895
Yet another fine example of a question
that's besides the friggin' point!

12:09.979 --> 12:11.772
You were supposed to deliver him,
Mr. Nelson.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.024
But there are zero Matt Murdocks
in my custody.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.360
Zero Jasper Evans left alive.

12:18.028 --> 12:22.199
Think that's random?
He kills the one guy with dirt on Fisk.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.869
You know that already?
Is that why you don't wanna go there?

12:24.952 --> 12:25.953
-Karen--
-What?

12:31.792 --> 12:35.755
That psycho in a suit
did Agent Nadeem a huge favor.

12:37.298 --> 12:41.552
Now there's no one left to tell the world
what a fool Fisk is making of the FBI.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.932
Did you know Daredevil
was gonna attack the <i>Bulletin?</i>

12:47.016 --> 12:48.684
Is that why you brought
your gun last night?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.561
Okay. We're done here.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.321
[door opens]

13:00.988 --> 13:01.822
[door closes]

13:05.034 --> 13:06.202
Are you okay?

13:07.244 --> 13:10.372
No, I'm definitely not okay.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.249
[cell phone ringing]

13:13.834 --> 13:16.045
[cell phones ringing and chiming]

13:17.588 --> 13:20.424
None of the people who own those phones
are okay, either.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.551
-Come on. Let's go.
-No...

13:23.552 --> 13:27.765
I don't get it. You... You almost died.
That doesn't leave a mark?

13:28.349 --> 13:30.351
I don't have time to think about that.

13:30.434 --> 13:33.395
Right now,
Agent Nadeem's got all my attention.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.274
If he digs into Jasper Evans, he'll know
we're telling the truth about Fisk.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.693
Then he'll dig into the rest of it.
I hope.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.459
I did this.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.586
[Foggy] Wilson Fisk did this.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.008
Evans wouldn't have come to the <i>Bulletin</i>
if I hadn't threatened his son.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.052
This isn't on you.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.346
And this isn't the time
to give up the fight.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.474
-We need to find Matt--
- No. Um...

14:11.267 --> 14:13.310
-I'm gonna go to the hospital.
-[cell phone vibrating]

14:13.394 --> 14:14.436
Are you hurt?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.398
I'm the only one who wasn't.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.444
Marci. I should take this. She's worried.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.371
Hey, babe.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.748
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.628
I know. I'm sorry, it's just been crazy.
The time has--

14:40.504 --> 14:41.964
Seema, I'm fine.

14:42.965 --> 14:43.966
Really, I--

14:47.386 --> 14:49.013
Seems, I wasn't even there.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.474
I got there after it was all over.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.518
That's right.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.356
I'll be home tonight, okay?

15:00.190 --> 15:01.233
[knock at door]

15:02.610 --> 15:04.194
Oh, shit. That's tonight?

15:06.864 --> 15:10.075
No. No, no. Don't cancel. Um...

15:11.410 --> 15:13.120
It'll be good to see the family.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.372
And good for Sami, you know?

15:15.456 --> 15:19.043
And let him know
everything really is all right.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.465
I love you, too.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.220
Where is he?

15:31.221 --> 15:34.141
-[Betsy] Damn, it's cold out here.
-[Melvin] You got your hat?

15:34.224 --> 15:35.309
I could get your hat.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.728
[Betsy] No, Melvin, it's okay.
I'm in the office today.

15:37.811 --> 15:38.812
[Melvin] Okay.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.909
I made you cheese and pickles.

15:52.868 --> 15:53.953
Thanks, love.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.083
-[Melvin] You got your gun?
-[Betsy] Of course. Right here.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.167
What's going on?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.211
You've been acting strange all morning.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.128
[Melvin] I...

16:03.671 --> 16:05.047
worry about you.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.508
Because I hang out
with paroled cons like you?

16:07.591 --> 16:09.218
[Melvin] 'Cause they're not like me. [Betsy] I can take care of myself,
big man.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.099
You be good today.
I'll make asopao for dinner.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.225
[Melvin] Okay.

16:18.727 --> 16:19.728
Love you.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.281
[Matt] Betsy's your parole officer.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.539
Please don't tell anyone.
It's against the rules.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.125
I don't care
what you do with Betsy, Melvin.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.419
You know why I'm here.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.463
Fisk made me make the suit.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.258
Did that man hurt you?

16:50.134 --> 16:51.301
I'm sorry.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.511
Who was he?

16:53.053 --> 16:54.221
He didn't tell me his name.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.516
But I can make you a new one...
to protect you against him.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.269
-It'd be a fair fight.
-I don't want the suit anymore.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.146
You don't like it?

17:02.229 --> 17:03.939
I've outgrown what it stood for.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.737
When you made my suit,
there were molds, measurements.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.575
At the workshop, maybe there's something.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.161
I've been to the workshop.
It's been burned down.

17:17.244 --> 17:21.498
Yeah, I burned it down,
because I didn't want to help Fisk, but...

17:21.582 --> 17:23.834
he made me a new shop
and he threatened Betsy.

17:26.211 --> 17:30.632
People died
because you helped him, Melvin.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.344
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.932
Where is your new shop?

18:21.350 --> 18:22.518
[Marci] Foggy Bear?

18:25.854 --> 18:28.816
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

18:28.899 --> 18:30.651
When did you get here?

18:30.734 --> 18:33.737
I tried to stay awake.
I've been watching the news all night.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.197
Are you hurt?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.283
Babe, talk to me.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.703
I'm okay.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.039
I'm just tired.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.590
Let's get you to bed.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.596
Babe?

19:21.952 --> 19:23.120
[Ray] Jasper Evans.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.498
Locked up in '91
on a couple of murder two counts.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.544
Seems he walked into a convenience store,
got talked to the wrong way,

19:30.627 --> 19:32.212
ended up shooting an honest cashier

19:32.296 --> 19:35.382
and a sweet old granny
picking up her Sunday Powerball ticket.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.969
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

19:39.052 --> 19:41.847
Warden, this lifer
was supposed to be serving

19:41.930 --> 19:44.224
a year in the hole
for shanking Wilson Fisk.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.726
Is that a question?

19:45.809 --> 19:49.855
How could he be in the hole and get killed
in a newspaper office at the same time?

19:49.938 --> 19:53.901
Some pencil-pusher must've checked
the wrong box and let him out by mistake.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.115
Look. I'm not trying to jam you up.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.577
I'm just trying to nail down
how he got out.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.496
And who might have wanted him dead.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.125
I need answers, Warden.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.796
You got nothing? Seriously?

20:19.009 --> 20:20.302
I want my lawyer.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.977
I talked to the <i>Bulletin</i> reporter.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.231
Jasper Evans was going to say
that Fisk staged his own shanking.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.066
He had him released
from prison as payback.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.150
Jesus.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.153
Tell me the warden disputes that.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.489
He's more concerned
with covering his own ass.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.158
-He's lawyered up.
-Oh, shit.

20:44.868 --> 20:48.121
It's all hearsay.
I mean, Evans might have been lying.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.957
And maybe he was telling the truth. We gotta kick this up the chain.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.961
-Who are you calling?
-The ADIC.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.173
And tell him what?
We don't know all the facts.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.510
Except there's a damn good chance
that Fisk is manipulating us.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.395
If it's true,

21:11.478 --> 21:15.565
every asshole we put away with Fisk's help
will be back on the street by morning.

21:16.733 --> 21:20.195
Everything we've done,
the people we've lost,

21:20.279 --> 21:21.822
it will all be for nothing.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.157
You can't unring that bell.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.368
Just give me a chance
to figure out if it's true.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.577
How?

21:28.954 --> 21:30.289
I need two days.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.708
You want a pony, too?

21:32.791 --> 21:35.335
Just let me get the facts.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.046
If Fisk really did play us, we'll bury that son of a bitch together.

21:47.806 --> 21:48.682
Wow.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.144
I don't know what got into me.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.312
It's okay.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.773
I mean, it was way, way better than okay.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.109
Like, way better.

21:59.192 --> 22:02.362
[chuckles] I mean, I get it.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.574
After what you went through last night.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.203
I was convinced I was gonna die.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.707
The last thing I remember thinking was,
"Not yet."

22:13.790 --> 22:15.876
Oh, you must've been so scared.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.754
More than I've ever been
in my entire life.

22:19.338 --> 22:24.926
But there was something else beneath it.
This feeling of being unsettled.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.930
[stammers] Important things left undone.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.435
Marry me.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.064
-Stop.
-I'm serious.

22:37.147 --> 22:40.650
-Let's go to the courthouse right now.
-Foggy Bear, slow down.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.236
I love you, Marci, and I'm pretty sure
that you love me, too.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.821
I do love you.

22:45.739 --> 22:49.534
But when you propose,
I want it to be from your heart.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.203
Not from this.

22:54.956 --> 22:55.957
[kisses] Shit.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.674
I'm gonna be late for my deposition.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.181
Go. Shower. I'll pick this up.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.587
What the hell?

23:45.048 --> 23:47.759
[Ellison] Think about what Amber
would have wanted. You know?

23:50.720 --> 23:53.682
[Carla] They want to take her off
of life support.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.684
I'll let you know what we decide.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.227
[Ellison] Okay. I'm so sorry.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.695
I'm...

24:06.778 --> 24:08.822
[woman over PA]
<i>All surgical residents to pre-op.</i>

24:08.905 --> 24:10.907
<i>All surgical residents to pre-op.</i>

24:12.909 --> 24:16.246
<i>Chief ortho resident to ER.</i>
<i>Chief ortho resident to ER.</i>

24:16.329 --> 24:18.123
-[Ellison] Oh, hey.
-[Karen] Hey.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.253
How are you feeling?

24:23.336 --> 24:24.254
[clicks tongue]

24:25.505 --> 24:26.798
I'm full of Percocet.

24:27.757 --> 24:28.925
Jell-O.

24:30.093 --> 24:31.553
-Rage.
-[Karen chuckles]

24:33.305 --> 24:34.181
Uh...

24:34.723 --> 24:35.724
Amber?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.017
Oh, she's on...

24:39.144 --> 24:44.274
She's brain-dead.
Just, uh, machines keeping her alive.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.527
-It wasn't worth it.
-Karen...

24:47.611 --> 24:49.029
Look, three people died.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.615
Why? Because I had to pick a fight?

24:51.698 --> 24:54.284
I'm pretty sure
that's what we're supposed to do. Sometimes, we get our asses kicked.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.998
Could you get me the water?
It's over there.

25:00.749 --> 25:05.462
Don't think you have some proprietary
claim over sticking it to Fisk.

25:05.545 --> 25:09.216
You know, this fight belongs
to every person in Hell's Kitchen.

25:09.299 --> 25:13.595
And I'm one of them,
so I intend to keep fighting.

25:13.678 --> 25:17.849
We're gonna go to print today, tomorrow,
and the next day and the next day.

25:20.519 --> 25:26.024
Here. I want you to write down
everything you know about Daredevil.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.151
His connection to Fisk.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.696
The man who attacked us last night,
it wasn't Daredevil.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.409
Who was it, then?

25:36.493 --> 25:37.577
[exhales]

25:38.411 --> 25:39.913
I don't know.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.750
But you know it wasn't Daredevil.

25:48.588 --> 25:52.425
Karen, do you know who Daredevil is?

25:57.681 --> 26:00.183
Don't ask me that. Please.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.351
Why not?

26:04.145 --> 26:10.902
Karen, if you know something,
you've gotta tell me right now.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.824
[stammers] I can't.

26:16.825 --> 26:22.581
Some piece of shit attacked my people,
in my house!

26:25.584 --> 26:26.918
And if you know anything,

26:27.002 --> 26:30.714
anything that will get me closer
to finding out who he is,

26:30.797 --> 26:34.134
then, God damn it,
you are going to tell me!

26:36.344 --> 26:40.098
Or you can go clean out your desk.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.583
[keypad beeping]

27:06.666 --> 27:08.293
[gate buzzes]

27:33.401 --> 27:34.903
[Matt] Why is the suit here?

27:36.154 --> 27:39.658
[Melvin] That's not the one he wore.
Fisk made me make two.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.784
Why?

27:43.703 --> 27:45.914
-Ask him yourself.
-What are you doing?

27:47.165 --> 27:48.708
I have to go now. He said.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.418
-Don't do this.
-I don't have a choice.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.336
He'll come for Betsy.

27:51.419 --> 27:54.172
Why'd he ask you to trap me here?
Is he coming? Tell me who wore the suit!

27:54.255 --> 27:55.882
I will find him.
I will put an end to this.

27:55.965 --> 27:58.343
I can't. Fisk will know.
And he'll hurt Betsy.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.428
If you really loved her,
you'd cut her loose.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.098
This life doesn't work with Betsys.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.225
[grunting]

28:06.726 --> 28:08.228
[Melvin] I can't let you leave!

28:20.031 --> 28:22.534
[Matt groaning]

29:04.701 --> 29:07.495
-Someone's coming.
-I'm not supposed to be here.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.553
It's the FBI, Melvin.
Why would Fisk send...

29:24.679 --> 29:26.806
They're supposed to find you
with the suit.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.644
Oh, God.

29:31.728 --> 29:35.273
He's framing me for being Daredevil.
Oh, God.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.027
Melvin, come on, he's tricking you.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.446
Please. Betsy's all I have.

29:41.529 --> 29:44.574
Once Fisk has me, he will kill you both.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.454
-Oh, man.
-You gotta help me, or Betsy's dead.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.914
Who did you make the suit for?

29:50.997 --> 29:53.291
He never told me his name...

29:54.501 --> 29:55.919
but he was an FBI agent.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.171
How do you know that?

29:58.713 --> 30:01.633
He was talking about it
with the man who brought him.

30:01.716 --> 30:03.760
[agent 1] Breach. Breach. Breach.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.388
[agent 2] FBI! Don't move!

30:09.390 --> 30:10.517
Go! Go! Go!

30:51.599 --> 30:53.560
[agent 2] Stop fighting, or we'll shoot!

31:02.277 --> 31:03.611
[agent 3] Hands behind your head.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.240
-[Melvin] Please! I gotta get to her!
-[agent 3] On your knees.

31:07.323 --> 31:08.324
On your knees!

31:12.912 --> 31:14.163
[Melvin] Betsy!

31:14.956 --> 31:17.041
He'll hurt Betsy!

31:22.755 --> 31:25.466
-He asleep?
-Been in bed all night.

31:26.509 --> 31:27.594
[Ray] I need to talk to him.

31:27.677 --> 31:31.097
-You want company?
-No. I got it.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.187
[Manning] Potter's in custody.

31:38.271 --> 31:41.608
Should we alter his situation
or his girlfriend's?

31:41.691 --> 31:42.692
No.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.362
He's irrelevant now.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.576
Where is Poindexter?

31:51.659 --> 31:53.119
Laying low, as ordered.

31:53.828 --> 31:56.414
Although, I'm concerned
about his mental stability.

31:56.497 --> 31:57.498
Yeah.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.920
I've demanded a lot from him.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.546
You keep an eye on him.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.759
But let him be for now.

32:53.638 --> 32:54.973
We need to talk.

32:56.265 --> 32:58.059
You're working late.

32:58.142 --> 33:01.729
Shouldn't you be with your family?
Seema, isn't it?

33:01.813 --> 33:03.898
Say her name again and see what happens.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.864
What can I help you with?

33:11.948 --> 33:14.409
[scoffs] Help me.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.497
You know, you remind me of someone
I knew growing up.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.249
Jack Kem.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.503
Yeah, but everyone knew him as Jiggy.

33:25.586 --> 33:29.424
You know, Jiggy lived
in a two-family house all by himself.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.468
It was practically a mansion to me.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.846
But Jiggy was a helper, too.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.349
He was always
helping out folks on the block.

33:39.058 --> 33:43.563
Annie the single mom needs a new car.
Jiggy's got it.

33:43.646 --> 33:47.608
The Hoffmans are desperate for rent.
No problem.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.155
Ten-year-old me
thought this guy was a hero.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.327
But it turned out
Jiggy had hidden ten kilos of heroin

33:58.411 --> 33:59.996
in the trunk of Annie's sedan.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.499
Another five in the Hoffman baby's room.

34:06.419 --> 34:09.297
Guess who the cops arrested
when they tracked down that powder?

34:12.133 --> 34:13.009
[Ray scoffs]

34:13.885 --> 34:16.095
I've seen your kind of help before.

34:22.185 --> 34:26.064
Have a little faith in me,
Special Agent Nadeem.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.693
I'm a better man than Jiggy.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.112
This...

34:34.822 --> 34:36.324
All of this...

34:40.119 --> 34:42.497
This was my price,

34:43.247 --> 34:46.793
which I was plain about
at the start of our relationship.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.046
And you have paid it.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.219
I need to know.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.763
Right now.

35:01.682 --> 35:06.145
You let Jasper Evans out of prison
to pay him back for shanking you?

35:08.856 --> 35:12.610
Your desperation diminishes you,
Special Agent.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.279
Good night.

36:09.208 --> 36:13.171
[Fisk] "The Hero of Hell's Kitchen
Feeds a Simpleton to the Feds."

36:14.088 --> 36:17.091
Won't that make a hell of a headline
for tomorrow's <i>Bulletin?</i>

36:18.342 --> 36:19.844
Melvin made his choice.

36:21.137 --> 36:24.015
Yet you did hesitate before you left. Were you waiting for a messenger
from the Lord to stop you,

36:27.727 --> 36:30.354
like he stopped Abraham
from killing his son?

36:31.272 --> 36:34.066
Were you disappointed
no messenger arrived...

36:34.150 --> 36:40.156
or relieved that you didn't have to risk
your life for a weak-minded criminal?

36:50.082 --> 36:53.502
You're not strong enough
to beat the man I sent for you.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.796
You're not smart enough to beat me.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.133
You couldn't do it alone.
You couldn't do it with your friends.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.012
Your father never knew when to lay down.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.806
He was too proud.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.100
You will die the same way.

37:29.163 --> 37:31.374
Please, Betsy, don't do me like this.

37:31.457 --> 37:34.585
I wasn't the one who violated parole.
You did this to yourself.

37:37.421 --> 37:38.881
-[Matt] Betsy.
-[gasps]

37:38.965 --> 37:43.719
Don't. I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here about Melvin.

37:46.138 --> 37:48.099
Melvin Potter?

37:48.182 --> 37:49.809
[Matt] He's been arrested.

37:49.892 --> 37:50.893
Bullshit.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.020
He's not gonna tell anyone
about your relationship,

37:53.104 --> 37:54.939
but that's not
what you need to worry about.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.400
You need to worry about Wilson Fisk.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.236
Oh, shit. Damn it, Melvin.

38:00.319 --> 38:03.114
Fisk doesn't leave loose ends.
He will kill you.

38:03.197 --> 38:07.785
Don't go home. Don't go back to work.
Leave town.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.578
[Betsy] What about Melvin? Is he okay?

38:09.662 --> 38:11.038
You can't help Melvin.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.624
He made his bed
when he went back to work for Fisk.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.504
You're a cold piece of work, aren't you?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.716
Melvin told me
about the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.718
He thought you were a hero.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.972
I told him assholes like you and Fisk
are cut from the same cloth

38:28.055 --> 38:30.308
and both of you
would take advantage of Melvin

38:30.391 --> 38:32.977
because he has a good heart
and a trusting way!

38:33.060 --> 38:34.562
You've been warned, Betsy.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.605
You want to live?

38:36.689 --> 38:37.690
Run. [Marci] Foggy?

38:59.045 --> 39:00.755
Foggy, baby, are you okay?

39:01.547 --> 39:03.424
Because I don't think you're okay.

39:03.966 --> 39:04.800
Oh.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.969
I'm-- I'm fine.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.183
I think I know what Fisk is up to.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.315
[crying and sniffling]

39:59.855 --> 40:00.940
[line ringing]

40:06.112 --> 40:07.154
[man] <i>Hello?</i>

40:09.865 --> 40:14.245
-Hi, Dad. It's me.
-<i>Karen? Good Lord.</i>

40:14.912 --> 40:19.333
<i>I heard something on the news.</i>
<i>That wasn't where you work, was it?</i>

40:19.417 --> 40:22.420
Yeah. Yeah, it was. I'm okay, though.

40:25.047 --> 40:29.969
I was thinking that maybe
I could come home for a little while.

40:33.681 --> 40:36.434
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I'm afraid the timing is not great.</i>

40:40.312 --> 40:42.565
Yeah. Of course. I get it.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.151
<i>But you can call anytime, all right?</i>

40:51.949 --> 40:52.992
Dad...

40:53.993 --> 40:57.246
I was just trying to do the right thing.
It just...

40:58.038 --> 40:59.373
It went all wrong.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.378
<i>That's what you do, Karen.</i>

41:06.922 --> 41:08.090
<i>Good night.</i>

41:11.093 --> 41:12.386
[sobbing]

41:30.863 --> 41:32.781
[Ray] I'm not asking for prisoner files.

41:32.865 --> 41:36.118
All I want is footage
from the security cameras. Copies.

41:37.244 --> 41:38.412
I'll even pay for them.

41:41.081 --> 41:43.542
We're supposed to be
on the same side here.

41:43.626 --> 41:47.004
All I want to do is see exactly
what happened when Fisk got shanked.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.843
Well, you have him call me
as soon as he gets in. Understand?

41:53.511 --> 41:54.345
I'll--

41:55.721 --> 41:56.764
Asshole.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.783
[all] Surprise!

42:15.866 --> 42:16.867
[Seema laughing]

42:16.951 --> 42:18.410
Wow. [chuckles]

42:19.245 --> 42:21.497
[Seema] Congratulations
on your promotion, <i>nuuri.</i>

42:21.580 --> 42:22.581
Thanks, everyone.

42:22.665 --> 42:24.875
Hey, bud. Come here.

42:29.421 --> 42:30.839
Sorry I'm late.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.012
[clinking glass]

42:37.429 --> 42:42.935
Ray, you make every single person
in this room so proud.

42:43.602 --> 42:47.022
Proud of the man you are
and who you strive to be.

42:47.106 --> 42:49.358
For the example you set for our son.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.987
For the husband and friend we adore.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.698
And for being the man
who hogs more blankets at night

42:55.781 --> 42:58.325
-than is humanly possible.
-[all chuckle]

42:59.159 --> 43:03.914
But even with that, you've always been
the person to warm my heart.

43:05.332 --> 43:08.669
Congratulations
on your well-deserved promotion.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.254
-[man] Cheers.
-[woman] Congratulations.

43:10.337 --> 43:12.298
-I love you.
-I love you.

43:12.381 --> 43:13.382
Eww.

43:14.925 --> 43:16.427
Way to kill the moment, buddy.

43:16.510 --> 43:19.555
-[chuckles]
-Mom, we're out of soda.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.932
[Seema] There's plenty
in the fridge downstairs.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.058
I'll get it.

43:23.642 --> 43:25.227
I need a moment with you first.

43:29.732 --> 43:30.733
What?

43:34.028 --> 43:36.739
-I told you, everything is fine.
-You lied to me.

43:37.448 --> 43:40.534
I called you, afraid for your life,
and you lied.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.787
I have to hear from Annie Wellers
what really happened?

43:43.871 --> 43:46.957
That that murderer attacked you
and that you shot him?

43:47.041 --> 43:48.876
-Seems--
-I have to hear it from her?

43:51.086 --> 43:53.839
-I didn't want you to worry.
-Well, I am worried.

43:53.922 --> 43:57.718
I'm worried what this job
is doing to you, to us.

43:59.094 --> 44:00.304
What's that supposed to mean?

44:00.387 --> 44:03.265
I will always have your back.
To them. To everyone.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.393
But I'm not an idiot.

44:07.269 --> 44:10.314
-I didn't say you are.
-When you lie to my face, you do.

44:19.615 --> 44:20.699
You're right.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.121
I'm just trying
to keep everything together.

44:27.873 --> 44:30.542
I don't want to screw any of this up.

44:31.794 --> 44:35.714
I worked so hard for this, for us.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.679
How-- How can I fix this?

44:46.892 --> 44:48.852
You can start with telling me the truth.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.108
And by getting more drinks.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.277
[chuckles]

45:09.832 --> 45:10.916
[sighs]

45:29.893 --> 45:32.563
-[Ray grunting]
-I didn't come here to fight.

45:36.775 --> 45:38.277
[panting]

45:41.613 --> 45:42.865
Who are you?

45:44.408 --> 45:45.617
I'm Daredevil.

45:46.535 --> 45:47.703
The real one.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.848
-You don't look like--
-I buried the red suit.

46:08.932 --> 46:11.727
The man who attacked the <i>Bulletin,</i>
he resurrected it.

46:14.563 --> 46:18.650
You do, however, match the description
of a guy who's been tuning up FBI agents.

46:18.734 --> 46:23.155
Which is the last thing I ever wanted,
but you people haven't left me any choice.

46:24.656 --> 46:28.410
If you'd just wake the hell up instead
of playing right into Fisk's hands.

46:28.494 --> 46:32.164
He's using you, and I think you know it.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.959
Now, I heard you confront
that psycho at the <i>Bulletin.</i>

46:36.043 --> 46:39.004
I heard you try to stop him,
and he almost killed you, too.

46:39.087 --> 46:41.298
So let me ask you this, Agent Nadeem...

46:42.841 --> 46:44.676
Who do you think is the danger here?

46:45.427 --> 46:46.428
Me... or him?

46:50.265 --> 46:51.892
-[shushes]
-[door opens]

46:52.476 --> 46:55.020
[Sami] Dad, Mom wants to know
where you are.

46:56.563 --> 46:58.065
Don't come down, Sami.

46:59.107 --> 47:01.360
I dropped a beer, there's glass.

47:03.987 --> 47:07.074
Tell your mom I need
a couple of minutes to clean it up.

47:07.157 --> 47:08.158
[Sami] Okay.

47:08.742 --> 47:09.660
[door closes]

47:12.120 --> 47:15.833
Let's say I believe the guy
that just broke into my house.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.293
Let's just say that.

47:20.587 --> 47:21.797
What do you got?

47:23.340 --> 47:26.426
The man who attacked the <i>Bulletin</i>
dressed as Daredevil...

47:28.095 --> 47:29.555
he's in the FBI.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.481
Keep talking.
