WEBVTT

00:18.978 --> 00:21.147
Careful. You already lost one.

00:25.443 --> 00:26.527
Good.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.989
- Faster, gentlemen, please.
- Yes, sir.

00:33.576 --> 00:35.036
How's it coming?

00:35.161 --> 00:36.704
This is fucking cool.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.123
What did I tell you, motherfucker?

00:41.751 --> 00:43.502
Stop fucking around.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.671
I don't want to be here all night.
Understood?

00:45.796 --> 00:46.881
Yes, it's all good.

00:47.006 --> 00:48.632
Let's go.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.303
Fucking idiot.

00:54.096 --> 00:57.683
My dad had 20 years in this shit.
I only have six months.

00:58.476 --> 01:01.145
Pedal to the metal then, bitch.

01:05.149 --> 01:07.443
How many of these things
do we have to empty?

01:07.902 --> 01:10.154
How much fucking money
do you want to make?

01:10.279 --> 01:11.614
A fucking lot.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.007
'In its prime, the Cali cartel

03:35.132 --> 03:38.427
'was moving 30 tons of coke
a month into America...

03:39.386 --> 03:41.472
'...most of it
through their New York operation

03:41.597 --> 03:44.183
'and an alliance with Mexican traffickers
out of Juárez

03:44.308 --> 03:47.061
'that brought tons of product
across our border.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.730
'That means that
in an average six-month period,

03:49.855 --> 03:52.524
'they could put 180 tons
on the street.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.653
'But there was nothing average
about this.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.700
'These were the last six months
in the life of the Cali cartel.

04:02.159 --> 04:05.704
'They were going for it, making sure
there were no loose ends.'

04:07.748 --> 04:10.501
Mrs. Salazar?

04:12.503 --> 04:14.505
Mrs. Salazar, housekeeping.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.549
- Come back later, please.
- As you wish.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.029
If you want something done right...

04:40.531 --> 04:42.866
...you have to do it yourself.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.202
Just like in life, Don Gilberto.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.163
If you don't play,
you're going to watch others score.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.879
My organisation has four partners,
but only one leader.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.924
I wanted to meet with you

04:59.049 --> 05:02.928
to make sure there are
no misunderstandings in the North Valley

05:03.762 --> 05:07.891
regarding the restructuring
and the necessary house cleaning.

05:08.017 --> 05:14.523
No, we were simply curious
about Claudio Salazar's absence.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.819
I will be honest with you.
Salazar never contributed a thing.

05:18.944 --> 05:22.948
He never gave anyone work.
He made more noise than money.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.743
Better said, too much noise.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.792
We are moving forward with the plan,

05:34.335 --> 05:37.963
and we would like to know
if our friends are in agreement.

05:39.423 --> 05:42.384
Your message about the surrender
was very clear

05:42.509 --> 05:45.888
and was very well received
by all of us in the North Valley.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.058
Have a safe trip home.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.853
Henao... thank you for your friendship.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.522
Excuse me.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.276
Pacho.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.908
Pacho.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.411
Let's take advantage of this window
to maximise our profits.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.164
I'd like to double our output
through Mexico.

06:12.831 --> 06:17.586
Why don't you go there?
Meet with Carrillo Fuentes. He likes you.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.297
Make one last deal.

06:21.799 --> 06:26.095
We both know that isn't the only reason
you're sending me there.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.806
Pacho.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.475
Look, Pacho...

06:33.018 --> 06:36.021
I think it would be best
if you left Cali for a bit,

06:36.146 --> 06:38.941
while things cool off.

06:40.734 --> 06:46.240
Remember, Pacho, we're going
to walk away from this happy and rich.

06:47.658 --> 06:50.577
'Like I said,
they were going for it.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.497
'While they were building up
their retirement accounts,

06:53.622 --> 06:56.208
'what were we doing about it?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.835
'Jack shit.'

06:59.169 --> 07:03.715
I don't want
to rub your noses in that, gentlemen.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.136
My concern is that your men in Cali

07:07.261 --> 07:11.682
didn't so much as contact
my senior officer there.

07:11.807 --> 07:17.563
We've agreed that we can't have
those kinds of unilateral operations.

07:18.564 --> 07:22.192
Our laws, our rules, will be respected.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.610
Of course, General.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.780
We apologise for the misunderstanding.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.907
Won't happen again.

07:29.032 --> 07:34.163
Well, I'm sorry, but I will need more
than your assurances.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.798
Colonel.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.386
Agent Peña.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.306
- How's your son?
- Oh, he's fine.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.809
He got transferred to technical services.
Better fit for him.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.565
Maybe I should join him.
Not a lot of police work these days.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.194
Yeah.
What did you expect?

08:05.777 --> 08:09.573
When you sell your soul to the devil,
you're not allowed to ask for it back.

08:14.286 --> 08:17.831
The men who let loose Los Pepes
on Colombia should have been arrested.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.459
Instead, they got promoted.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.049
Excuse me.

08:37.351 --> 08:41.104
There he is.
Javi Peña,<i>el jefe.</i>

08:42.105 --> 08:45.400
Never thought I'd see the day,
but I'm sure as shit glad to see you now.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.778
- Duff, it's been a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.531
- Lopez.
- Hey.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.324
I still can't believe
you two were in the same class.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.201
It's a miracle this place
is still standing, huh?

08:59.540 --> 09:01.208
Some bullshit, huh, Javi?

09:04.711 --> 09:07.339
Come on. Is this where you go
all "Bad Lieutenant" on us?

09:07.464 --> 09:08.715
Like you and Murphy were never made?

09:08.840 --> 09:12.427
Yeah. You guys are famous.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.562
Sometimes you get them,
sometimes they get you, huh?

09:22.145 --> 09:23.772
Next time, we get them.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.985
There isn't gonna be a next time.
They're rotating you home.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.446
The Colombians are pulling your visa.
You're outta here tonight.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.118
Come on.
Who's running things here, man?

09:38.787 --> 09:40.330
They are.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.628
Well, thanks for getting our back, sir.

10:00.309 --> 10:03.687
Wouldn't you have liked
to be born in this era? Take a look.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.690
- Just like the Cauca River, right?
- Identical.

10:08.984 --> 10:11.403
Dad, where are we
with the government?

10:14.448 --> 10:18.035
They won't let us use the drug stores
as collateral for the Centenario property

10:18.160 --> 10:20.329
until they're cleared through surrender.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.581
I know, but eventually they will be.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.837
And that's all you can tell me?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.883
You know the rule.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.510
You can't be a part of this.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.430
I didn't send you to law school
so you could worry about our surrender.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.474
That's already been planned.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.560
I sent you to take advantage
of what happens after it's done,

10:43.685 --> 10:46.897
when our family is a leader
in the business community.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.652
You're reading it again?

10:51.777 --> 10:55.155
You should read it once in a while.
Wise words.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.449
Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.118
You have a call
from our friend in the capital.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.462
Hello?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.799
'Four people,
including three children,

11:13.924 --> 11:16.093
'are dead and thousands more injured

11:16.218 --> 11:19.805
'in a mysterious gas leak
in the area of Yumbo in Cali.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.099
'Investigators are at the scene
of the incident,

11:22.224 --> 11:25.852
'but have not yet discovered
the source of the gas leak.

11:25.977 --> 11:31.733
'State officials told residents
there will be a formal investigation.'

11:41.952 --> 11:44.830
Silvio! Can I bum a smoke?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.839
Isn't it dangerous?

11:54.798 --> 11:56.800
No more than it ever was.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.972
If it was a natural gas leak,
I want to know before lighting up.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.851
Unless it's not.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.688
I think you should talk
to the captain, Carolina.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.898
He doesn't have the balls to talk to me.

12:14.025 --> 12:18.405
Silvio, help me out. You have kids.
Off the record.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.658
I don't know, Carolina.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.494
Why don't you talk to him?

12:24.619 --> 12:26.788
He is the district safety inspector.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.875
He'll issue the report.
Why don't you ask him for a comment?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.298
- Silvio!
- Excuse me.

12:37.090 --> 12:41.720
Careful picking it up.
Lift it up. Careful. Grab the other side.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.727
That's good. A little bit more.

12:52.355 --> 12:56.610
If they connect us to this, our friend
doubts the government will honour our deal.

12:56.735 --> 13:01.531
We'll be seen as no different from
Escobar, killing women and children.

13:02.365 --> 13:05.494
Months of negotiations and money
down the drain.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.205
Just like the poison
you monkeys dumped.

13:08.830 --> 13:12.417
There's a reporter asking questions
in Yumbo.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.295
And there's this safety inspector
in charge of the investigation.

13:15.420 --> 13:19.341
I wouldn't worry about the reporter.
We have lots of reporters.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.135
But a government investigator!
If the motherfucker goes...

13:22.260 --> 13:24.679
Dad, let me take care of it.
I said I would handle it.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.849
You've demonstrated very clearly
that you can't handle it.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.686
Take care of it. Discreetly.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.648
Without any violence.
That's the last thing we need.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.318
What? You have another bright idea?

13:47.285 --> 13:50.288
That's why I didn't want our children
in the business.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.292
We made a mistake, Gilberto.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.756
Let go. Turn. Run.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.385
You need to let out some string.
Careful with Grandma.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.928
You see?

14:06.555 --> 14:07.430
Mm-hmm.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.683
- This is the bedroom.
- Uh-huh.

14:09.808 --> 14:10.892
No, sorry, Dad.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.187
- No, this is the living room.
- The living room.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.273
It's big, Jorge.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.609
And the pool will go here.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.654
- And there, the kitchen.
- Mm-hmm.

14:23.822 --> 14:24.990
And look...

14:25.740 --> 14:29.286
Right in front there,
I'm putting in a jacuzzi.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.620
A jacuzzi?

14:34.499 --> 14:37.168
I always thought
your brother would have...

14:38.295 --> 14:40.046
...the house on the hill.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.802
You were just always lost
in your engineering ideas.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.015
What was the last one?

14:50.140 --> 14:51.558
Bio-diesel.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.603
Bio-diesel.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.064
Vegetable gas?

14:58.189 --> 15:00.317
Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.319
Well...

15:04.279 --> 15:05.864
Very good.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.326
Better late than never.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.871
I'm glad you like it, Dad.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.707
- Thank you.
- Jorge, the girls are calling you.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.959
Yes, I'm coming.
Paola.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.464
You'll be very happy
when you build the house here.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.675
- It's all very nice.
- Affirmative, General.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.061
You impressed him.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.397
I don't care what he thinks.

15:40.231 --> 15:43.401
That's why you haven't told him
who you work for?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.030
It was always temporary.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.573
Temporary?

15:49.324 --> 15:50.617
Right.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.412
You know this lot is bigger
than we need.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.331
Yes, but it's the one we want.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.418
It's the one you deserve.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.256
Six more months.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.011
Okay? I promise.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.772
Go.

16:20.897 --> 16:24.067
- I'll go with your parents.
- I'm sorry, honey.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.567
- 'Hello?'
- It's me.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.693
'Chepe!'

17:07.902 --> 17:10.280
- How's everything going, brother?
- 'All right.'

17:10.405 --> 17:13.867
We're about to beat
our profit record, brother.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.037
Good. Keep me posted.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.373
'You should be happy, Gilberto.'

17:20.498 --> 17:22.834
'Chepe, do me a favour.'

17:22.959 --> 17:27.088
Keep a low profile. At least for now.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.634
I got a lot of stuff going on up here
at the moment.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.597
I just need more ether
to reach the numbers we talked about.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.099
'Why? Is everything all right?
You sound weird.'

17:38.224 --> 17:40.977
I'm dealing with a problem
that is stressing me out.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.229
It's our fault.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.482
Actually, it's David's, the dumbass.

17:45.607 --> 17:48.485
- 'Is it bad?'
- I hope not.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.237
'But it could complicate our surrender.'

17:52.697 --> 17:54.908
Okay. I'll be careful.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.411
So good you're coming back, brother.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.539
You'll leave behind the hustle
and shit of that city.

18:01.664 --> 18:02.957
'It's not so bad.'

18:03.458 --> 18:06.419
I love the trees in fall.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.297
The park looks gorgeous.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.884
'I love you, brother. Talk soon.'

18:13.009 --> 18:14.010
Okay.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.939
Miss, the valet says
the car hasn't returned.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.441
- I see. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.152
- María.
- Luisa.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.072
What's happening?
Claudio hasn't returned?

18:34.197 --> 18:36.116
No. And Diego?

18:36.241 --> 18:40.078
Diego dragged his drunk ass in
at six in the morning.

18:40.703 --> 18:41.746
Okay.

18:41.871 --> 18:42.997
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.632
Spell that for me.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.387
What the fuck are you doing?

18:57.512 --> 19:00.140
- Prime real estate opened up.
- You vulture.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.183
You know, Lopez is probably
still at the airport.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.476
Yeah.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.437
Got it.

19:06.563 --> 19:10.233
Thanks. We'll run these down.
And Eddie, hey, congrats again.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.654
- Eddie?
- Yeah, Kacerosky.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.948
Cornerstone's his.
Good haul on Cali.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.076
He's got addresses, numbers,
a couple of names.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.538
Now you and your badass sunglasses
and hockey hair

19:23.663 --> 19:25.832
want to go ring some doorbells?

19:26.791 --> 19:29.294
Cali's the front line, Dan.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.963
More like the express lane home.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.508
I got a soon-to-be ex waiting
to serve me the second I get back.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.595
Well, I didn't transfer to Colombia
to file wire reports

19:38.720 --> 19:40.972
and drink stale Bud at Mr. Ribs.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.852
I'm moving you to Duffy's desk
while you're gone. I feel alone up here.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.604
Okay, knock yourself out.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.193
- You got a minute, sir?
- Yeah.

19:54.777 --> 19:58.531
Wanted to talk to you about all this intel
coming out of Miami with Cornerstone.

19:59.407 --> 20:02.744
Paper trail from the warehouse
they busted threw up some flags.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.372
- What's this?
- It's a shitty diagram.

20:06.497 --> 20:09.500
But there's five or six companies
that show repeatedly.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.711
Now, my buddy in Customs
did some digging.

20:11.836 --> 20:15.131
They're all owned by Cali or are
the address of record for shell companies.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.508
They're moving Swiss francs
from Liechtenstein,

20:17.634 --> 20:20.386
bearer bonds from Luxembourg,
but even they leave tracks.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.430
- What's your name?
- Feistl.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.932
Chris Feistl.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.559
Feistl, what are you asking me?

20:26.684 --> 20:28.478
Send me to Cali, sir.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.814
You know, I want it, sir.

20:33.316 --> 20:37.362
I mean, these companies,
this is the cartel's financial brainstem.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.448
It's overstating it a little bit,
wouldn't you say?

20:42.408 --> 20:43.952
It's a start.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.829
We're not sending any personnel
to Cali at the moment.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.832
I don't understand.
Who's the new Cali team?

20:49.958 --> 20:53.253
- For now, there isn't one.
- There... Sir?

20:54.003 --> 20:57.674
We have arrest warrants for Gilberto
and Miguel Rodríguez, Pacho Herrera...

20:57.799 --> 21:00.009
I'm aware who runs the Cali cartel.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.512
Is there anything else, Agent Feistl?

21:04.514 --> 21:06.474
No, sir. That's... I'm good.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.017
Good.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.855
Nice office, by the way.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.236
Thanks.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.293
I got your message.
What's going on?

21:34.210 --> 21:36.921
We have a problem
with the fucking safety inspector.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.715
He won't accept the money?

21:39.674 --> 21:42.260
He has three crucifixes in his office.
Three.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.763
- Reasoning with him is impossible.
- I see.

21:48.391 --> 21:51.978
Tell me, what the hell was David doing
with the chlorine gas?

21:52.687 --> 21:54.272
Do you really want to know?

21:55.815 --> 21:59.902
About a year ago, Don Miguel and
Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.

22:01.529 --> 22:06.326
The idea was to replace the gas
with cocaine and send it to the U.S.

22:07.410 --> 22:11.664
They don't check it at Customs
because it's a poisonous gas.

22:14.584 --> 22:18.463
So that's why David spilled
the gas in Yumbo?

22:22.675 --> 22:26.012
We should let him clean up
his own mess.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.432
That's not going to happen, Jorge.

22:29.557 --> 22:35.063
If the fucking inspector doesn't say
what we need him to say, we're all fucked.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.106
Do you think they're going
to honour the pact?

22:37.231 --> 22:39.192
Do you think there's really
going to be a surrender

22:39.317 --> 22:43.279
between the cartel and the government
if what happened in Yumbo goes public?

22:43.404 --> 22:44.822
Never.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.285
What do we know
about the safety inspector?

22:50.828 --> 22:55.083
Here's everything. We have phone numbers,
his home and office addresses,

22:55.708 --> 22:59.170
bank accounts, income tax, properties.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.173
And the only thing we're sure about?

23:03.549 --> 23:05.343
This motherfucker is clean.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.851
There's no one clean in this world,
Córdova. No one.

23:14.852 --> 23:18.398
Find something on him, then. Quickly.

23:20.358 --> 23:21.859
Gentlemen!

23:22.485 --> 23:26.239
We're going to put all our assets
on this man.

23:28.116 --> 23:33.246
'We have to watch his wife, his kids,
even his fucking dog.'

23:34.205 --> 23:37.333
We need to watch his house,
from the inside and out,

23:37.458 --> 23:40.711
every single corner, 24/7.

23:42.505 --> 23:47.051
I want to know what he does at work,
who he meets and where.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.429
'I want to know his agenda.'

23:50.471 --> 23:53.891
Whatever he does,
we're going to find out.

23:54.392 --> 23:57.478
'We will be in charge of his fucking life!'

23:58.604 --> 24:02.066
And, of course,
we have to tap all his phones.

24:02.191 --> 24:05.570
At home, at the office,
and his cell phone.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.530
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

24:12.243 --> 24:15.371
Come to my house this Saturday
after soccer.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.498
My dad gave me permission.

24:18.082 --> 24:21.335
- 'Awesome, I'll see you there.'
- 'Cool, bye.'

24:22.837 --> 24:24.464
'End of call.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.389
'Recording number two. 2:16pm.'

24:33.514 --> 24:36.267
Yes, the company is registered

24:36.392 --> 24:39.353
under one of the Rodríguez's
fake companies.

24:40.188 --> 24:43.941
'Recording number three. 4:32pm.'

24:45.234 --> 24:48.696
I want to suck your dick.
Tomorrow.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.698
At the same place.

24:58.748 --> 24:59.874
Hello?

24:59.999 --> 25:02.251
'Ma'am,
I'm so sorry to bother you.'

25:02.376 --> 25:05.213
It's María. Is Claudio there?

25:06.047 --> 25:08.966
No. Isn't he with you?

25:09.842 --> 25:11.552
No. He didn't come home last night.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.471
'I'm worried.'

25:13.930 --> 25:17.350
Hmm... You're fighting again.

25:17.934 --> 25:20.186
'You're the reason
he seeks pleasure elsewhere.'

25:20.311 --> 25:21.729
Nobody's seen him.

25:23.981 --> 25:28.861
No one's seen him?
What did you do, María?

25:28.986 --> 25:30.738
- No...
- I'm sending the boys.

25:30.863 --> 25:34.617
No, that's not necessary.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

25:44.377 --> 25:47.380
Mrs. Salazar,
will you be checking out today?

26:15.700 --> 26:17.076
Hello, sir.

26:17.660 --> 26:20.454
They're always in room 105.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.206
Very good, thank you.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.091
What a woman.

27:57.593 --> 28:01.555
- This was well done.
- Thank you, sir.

28:01.681 --> 28:05.351
The inspector has a press conference
scheduled this afternoon.

28:08.312 --> 28:12.316
Someone needs to talk to him.
Finish the job.

28:12.441 --> 28:16.112
Don Gilberto, he knows me.
They won't let me in.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.698
Jorge...

28:19.490 --> 28:22.785
Jorge... you should handle it.

28:22.910 --> 28:26.288
You've done such great work.
Great work so far.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.959
And no one knows who he is.

28:33.796 --> 28:37.299
I appreciate that.
But I only gather information.

28:38.634 --> 28:41.971
Sir, the truth is,
I'm a man of... few words.

28:45.015 --> 28:50.062
Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest
companies depend on a small outcome

28:50.187 --> 28:51.772
to determine their future.

28:52.356 --> 28:59.029
Like the success of one operation
or an employee who is discreet and loyal.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.533
This is the final stretch.

29:03.284 --> 29:06.871
We all have to do our part.
Understood?

29:06.996 --> 29:08.205
Yes, sir.

29:15.713 --> 29:18.674
'The Cali cartel came
to New York for the cocaine market.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.801
'It's the largest in the world.

29:20.926 --> 29:25.347
'But they stayed for the ether.
You can't make coke without ether.

29:25.473 --> 29:29.101
'And while export restrictions had made it
hard to come by in Colombia,

29:29.226 --> 29:31.812
'it flowed freely in the States.

29:31.937 --> 29:35.232
'But maybe not as freely
as the godfathers would've liked.'

29:37.151 --> 29:39.570
Was there a problem
with your last order?

29:39.695 --> 29:41.322
No. No problems.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.700
I need to add another 300 barrels
to my next order.

29:46.035 --> 29:49.455
300 barrels?
Mr. Crespo, that's nearly double.

29:50.039 --> 29:51.665
I can't do it.

29:52.333 --> 29:53.751
How come?

29:53.876 --> 29:57.588
There's a new buyer. Their orders
are getting bigger and bigger.

29:58.255 --> 30:01.258
We're already stretched very thin.

30:01.383 --> 30:04.428
I've been your most important client
for years.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.723
I understand, but you told me
you were leaving the business.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.060
- However, this other organisation...
- Isn't.

30:12.061 --> 30:13.562
I'm sorry.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.273
So who are they?

30:18.234 --> 30:21.278
- They're kids.
- Hmm.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.572
Dominicans.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.951
Running out of some beauty parlour
in Queens.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.703
I see.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.957
They'll probably end up dead
or locked up.

30:34.124 --> 30:36.794
You know, it's a young man's world.

30:37.962 --> 30:41.131
We all have to make way
for the next generation.

30:43.634 --> 30:47.638
This beauty parlour in Queens,
give me the address.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.642
But...

31:14.206 --> 31:15.749
Can I get one of those?

31:22.006 --> 31:24.091
Quit four months ago.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.511
Looks like it's going well.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.981
Carolina Alvarez, "El Tiempo".

31:46.196 --> 31:50.451
So... what conclusions
should be drawn from the fact

31:50.576 --> 31:55.247
that the new DEA attaché has
this intimate history with Los Pepes?

31:55.372 --> 31:59.710
And does the fact that the Los Pepes death
squad being financed by the Cali cartel

31:59.835 --> 32:02.546
explain why no one seems
to be interested

32:02.671 --> 32:05.674
in going after Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela
and his partners?

32:06.258 --> 32:08.802
You can call the press office
if you want a comment, Miss Alvarez.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.971
Carolina, please.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.808
Have a nice day.

32:14.934 --> 32:17.394
Have you heard much
about the Cali accident?

32:18.062 --> 32:19.396
Four more people dead.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.650
Children.
Dozens more sick.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.906
An empty chlorine gas canister
was found nearby.

32:29.490 --> 32:32.534
And there's a rumour its manufacturer
is linked to a front company

32:32.660 --> 32:34.703
operated by the Cali cartel.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.749
Looks like you said, it was an accident.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.210
By the end of the day, it will be.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.545
No matter what the truth is.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.842
Thanks for the cigarette.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.559
Transportation came out
to $5 million each.

32:58.686 --> 33:01.105
You can see here that
the product loss was very little.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.607
And the bribes?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.235
Well, the payoffs...

33:07.319 --> 33:08.988
...they went up this week.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.450
Went up this week to six million, sir.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.288
- Guillermo.
- Yes, sir?

33:19.581 --> 33:24.503
What happens in six months
when these people stop receiving money?

33:30.175 --> 33:32.344
No more friends.

33:34.388 --> 33:35.764
This is everything, right?

33:36.515 --> 33:38.934
This is everything
down to the last penny, sir.

33:39.893 --> 33:43.313
And we have here coded pages
for all the politicians,

33:43.439 --> 33:46.358
the senators, congressmen,
all the cops.

33:47.568 --> 33:50.529
- I want an exact copy of this book.
- Yes, sir.

33:50.654 --> 33:53.699
It's our insurance
if they try to fuck us afterward.

33:54.908 --> 33:58.037
You think someone would dare
do something to you?

33:58.162 --> 34:02.708
Anything can happen.
If you're a pussy, they fuck you.

34:07.504 --> 34:10.215
Any news about Salazar's wife?

34:11.341 --> 34:13.510
Yes, Don Miguel.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.263
The bitch has been asking
about Claudio everywhere.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.561
You want me to handle it?

35:03.352 --> 35:06.063
'I understand you have
information on the Yumbo incident.'

35:06.188 --> 35:09.274
- Yes, I do.
- Good. Tell me.

35:33.090 --> 35:37.803
Your wife.
At the Palace Motel at 3:45pm.

35:38.303 --> 35:42.015
After she dropped the kids off
at soccer practice.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.731
So?

35:51.984 --> 35:54.611
At your press conference
this afternoon,

35:54.736 --> 35:59.116
you will announce that the gas leak
was a municipal accident.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.578
We have video and audio as well.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.624
Look, you bought-off monkey,

36:07.749 --> 36:10.794
take these pictures
and go fuck yourself.

36:10.919 --> 36:14.214
At the press conference this afternoon,
I'm going to tell the truth,

36:14.339 --> 36:16.758
so that the world will know
what you people do.

36:17.342 --> 36:20.262
And don't worry about my wife.
I already knew.

36:20.387 --> 36:24.141
Sometimes we make compromises
to keep a happy home.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.856
I can appreciate you wanting
to take the high road.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.985
However, you're not understanding me.

36:35.110 --> 36:39.740
The men that I work for don't care
about your relationship with your wife.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.784
They care what your children
might think,

36:42.910 --> 36:45.621
what their classmates might think.

36:46.914 --> 36:49.041
And your distinguished family.

36:50.584 --> 36:53.212
Think of what they would say
at your church.

36:53.795 --> 36:56.965
If you don't do what I tell you,

36:57.925 --> 37:01.428
the men I work for will make sure

37:01.970 --> 37:05.849
that the whole world
will have a copy of this tape.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.274
Thank you.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.739
Mrs. Salazar.

38:00.737 --> 38:03.907
So you've never had
a relaxation treatment before?

38:04.032 --> 38:06.159
I've never heard of it.

38:07.119 --> 38:09.246
Relaxation treatment?

38:10.038 --> 38:11.540
That sounds nice.

38:12.666 --> 38:15.377
You have a funny accent.

38:15.502 --> 38:18.005
- Where are you from?
- Colombia.

38:19.381 --> 38:22.050
- Colombian.
- This guy is Colombian, too.

38:22.175 --> 38:25.929
- Check it out. Both.
- Really?

38:40.819 --> 38:43.864
And I suppose that guy at the door
is also Colombian?

38:45.324 --> 38:47.743
What a small world, right?

38:52.539 --> 38:54.374
All right. What do you want?

38:57.586 --> 38:59.546
I want you to go through that door.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.674
The one with the English writing
I don't understand.

39:02.799 --> 39:06.511
Tell the men back there
that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño

39:06.636 --> 39:11.767
is getting a relaxation treatment
and would like to speak with them.

39:13.393 --> 39:15.020
Go.

39:20.317 --> 39:21.443
You stay.

39:31.578 --> 39:33.246
Cool.

40:45.652 --> 40:48.864
- Please, take a seat.
- It's better if I stand.

40:51.908 --> 40:55.120
- A drink?
- No. Thank you.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.624
I'm sorry for the way
you were brought here.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.255
I understand you have a question.

41:06.465 --> 41:09.259
I've spent all day
asking about my husband.

41:09.384 --> 41:12.637
- And you think I know the truth?
- Yes.

41:13.472 --> 41:15.474
And I don't think
you are afraid to tell me.

41:16.057 --> 41:20.770
- And if I don't tell you?
- Then I was wrong. And you are a coward.

41:29.279 --> 41:32.782
Your husband is dead.
He was killed by an associate of mine.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.203
For a personal injury he caused.

43:06.418 --> 43:08.837
This market, we made it ourselves.

43:09.713 --> 43:13.174
It's ours.
We can't just give it up to you.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.344
You haven't heard my proposal yet.

43:17.387 --> 43:18.930
Say what you got to say.

43:19.514 --> 43:24.436
The first thing you're going to do
is vacate this place immediately,

43:24.561 --> 43:26.396
and never come back.

43:26.980 --> 43:30.191
Oh, yeah?
And the second? What?

43:30.317 --> 43:31.776
Second...

43:33.361 --> 43:36.323
There is no second.
Just the first thing.

43:41.828 --> 43:44.080
- So you think this is a joke?
- Gentlemen.

43:44.205 --> 43:49.878
Part of being an adult is accepting things
that you wish weren't true.

43:50.670 --> 43:54.924
Recently, I have had to accept
some things that I don't like.

43:56.301 --> 43:59.304
I advise you to do the same.

44:02.891 --> 44:07.812
Look, you and your fucking hair
have ten seconds to get out of here.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.691
- Ten.
- Nine.

44:13.652 --> 44:14.944
- Nine.
- Eight.

44:16.237 --> 44:18.198
You think this is funny,
motherfucker?

44:19.407 --> 44:21.159
Seven.

44:24.037 --> 44:25.997
- Seven.
- Six.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.711
- Six.
- Five.

44:32.295 --> 44:33.588
- Four.
- Four.

44:33.713 --> 44:34.798
Three, two, one.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.427
- Check on him.
- Got it.

45:33.982 --> 45:37.110
"So then the crow flew up
as high as he could,

45:37.235 --> 45:41.781
"losing sight of the dogs,
and returned to the flock.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.492
"The crow went to find
his friend the cat,

45:45.660 --> 45:48.163
"whom he had saved from danger,

45:48.288 --> 45:52.751
"and lived with him
in peace and happiness."

45:53.334 --> 45:55.587
And that's where we'll leave off
because it's time for bed.

45:58.715 --> 45:59.716
You too.

46:01.926 --> 46:02.927
Very good.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.308
- Did the girls go to sleep?
- Yes.

46:08.433 --> 46:09.809
How's the book?

46:09.934 --> 46:12.479
I think they understand it
better than I do.

46:12.604 --> 46:14.773
'The municipal safety inspector

46:14.898 --> 46:18.026
'closed his investigation
into the tragedy in Yumbo today.

46:18.151 --> 46:20.779
'Hundreds were injured in a leak,

46:20.904 --> 46:24.783
'some are still in critical condition.

46:25.533 --> 46:29.287
'Four died, including three children.

46:29.412 --> 46:34.000
'The deceased were two seven-year-old
boys and a six-year-old girl.

46:34.125 --> 46:37.253
- Can you believe this horrible news?
- 'One of the boys was about to celebrate

46:37.378 --> 46:41.299
'his first communion
at the Santa María church.

46:41.424 --> 46:44.385
- 'Now, instead of celebration...'
- 'Fuck. This is terrible.'

46:44.511 --> 46:47.305
- '...there will be tears at their funerals.'
- It's terrible.

46:47.430 --> 46:49.390
I can't find my binoculars.

46:50.183 --> 46:52.602
- Dad, let's go, we're gonna miss the game.
- Sir.

46:53.436 --> 46:57.482
Flaco. You're my fourth wife, buddy.

46:57.607 --> 46:59.150
I love you, man.

46:59.275 --> 47:01.402
Sir, they want to make
an announcement at tonight's game,

47:01.528 --> 47:04.155
in honour of the victims
of the Yumbo tragedy.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.657
Good idea.

47:05.782 --> 47:09.828
And tell them to say we'll donate
half the ticket sales to the victims.

47:09.953 --> 47:11.538
- You got it.
- Now, let's see if we win.

47:11.663 --> 47:13.414
If we get to the game on time.

47:15.041 --> 47:17.460
'Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll keep this brief.

47:18.127 --> 47:23.716
'After a thorough investigation,
we've reached the conclusion

47:23.842 --> 47:27.929
'that the Yumbo chemical exposure

47:28.054 --> 47:33.268
'was caused by a faulty valve
in a natural gas line in the area.

47:34.060 --> 47:37.063
'And because of that, from now on,

47:37.188 --> 47:43.403
'the gas company will be responsible
for the expenses. Now...'

47:59.544 --> 48:01.880
You got a partner, right?

48:02.005 --> 48:04.299
Er... Yeah, kind of.

48:05.216 --> 48:07.302
Good. You're going to Cali.
