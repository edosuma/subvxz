00:00.373 --> 00:04.258
<i>Kids, in October 2011,</i>
<i>your Aunt Robin was in therapy.</i>

00:04.259 --> 00:06.792
<i>And against all logic,</i>
<i>it was actually going well.</i>

00:07.149 --> 00:08.515
But why?

00:08.517 --> 00:11.318
Why-why am I constantly looking
for reasons not to be happy?

00:11.320 --> 00:14.405
Maybe because the idea of
finally being happy...

00:14.407 --> 00:16.106
terrifies you.

00:16.108 --> 00:19.293
Bro, you are killing it today.

00:19.295 --> 00:20.944
Pshh!

00:22.130 --> 00:23.497
We got something good here.

00:23.499 --> 00:25.949
We are totes gonna conquer
my fear of abandonment!

00:25.951 --> 00:27.384
I can't see you anymore.

00:27.386 --> 00:29.553
Nice.

00:29.555 --> 00:31.588
"Oh, no! You're
abandoning me!"

00:32.424 --> 00:34.624
Oh, no. You're abandoning me?

00:34.626 --> 00:37.561
I'm sorry.
I'm moving to Alaska.

00:37.563 --> 00:41.015
<i>And that might have</i>
<i>been the end of it.</i>

00:41.017 --> 00:42.266
<i>But a week later...</i>

00:42.268 --> 00:44.318
Kevin?!

00:45.303 --> 00:46.487
What are you doing here?

00:46.489 --> 00:50.774
Okay, look, I lied to you
about moving to Alaska.

00:50.776 --> 00:52.943
I-I had to stop seeing you.

00:52.945 --> 00:54.228
Why?

00:54.230 --> 00:56.547
'Cause I think you're cute.

00:56.549 --> 00:58.382
And ethically,
I can't be your therapist

00:58.384 --> 01:00.217
if I'm attracted to you.

01:00.219 --> 01:02.819
Oh, I get it. You dump me
as a patient

01:02.821 --> 01:04.504
just so you can ask me out?

01:04.507 --> 01:05.639
I'm not gonna ask you out.

01:05.641 --> 01:06.974
You're not?

01:06.976 --> 01:09.810
No. We met in therapy.

01:09.812 --> 01:12.579
It's inappropriate for me
to date a patient.

01:13.348 --> 01:15.699
Anyway, it was nice seeing you.

01:16.518 --> 01:19.503
Hey, wait.

01:19.505 --> 01:21.004
How do you define "date"?

01:21.006 --> 01:24.141
Two people having a meal
together,

01:24.143 --> 01:25.192
sitting across the table

01:25.194 --> 01:26.643
making googly eyes
at each other...

01:26.645 --> 01:30.981
What about two people eating
alone, sitting side by side,

01:30.983 --> 01:34.184
making googly eyes
at the coffee maker?

01:34.186 --> 01:36.704
Okay, it's not a date.

01:36.706 --> 01:38.122
Exactly. Not a date.

01:38.124 --> 01:40.991
And <i>so Robin and Kevin had</i>
<i>breakfast alone,</i>

01:40.993 --> 01:45.412
<i>side by side</i>
<i>every day that week.</i>

01:46.948 --> 01:48.382
<i>Until finally...</i>

01:53.938 --> 01:54.705
Oh, hey!

01:54.707 --> 01:56.507
Sorry. No cabs.

01:56.509 --> 01:58.208
Ran 40 blocks
all the way here.

01:58.210 --> 01:59.560
May have knocked an old lady

01:59.562 --> 02:01.211
into the street,
don't know, I didn't look back.

02:01.213 --> 02:02.262
Let's just go on a real date.

02:02.264 --> 02:03.931
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

02:03.933 --> 02:05.399

Oh, I can't wait

02:22.588 --> 02:23.554
Is it good?

02:23.556 --> 02:24.772
Awesome. Wait, totally
hypothetically,

02:24.774 --> 02:27.224
do you like movies with a
shocking twist where all

02:27.226 --> 02:28.943
the main characters die
at the end?

02:28.945 --> 02:30.061
Yes.

02:30.063 --> 02:31.362
You will love this movie.

02:31.364 --> 02:32.697
Hey, guys.

02:32.699 --> 02:33.948
Hey, Marshall.
What's up?

02:33.950 --> 02:35.616
Well, I'll tell you what's up.

02:35.618 --> 02:37.802
You know how my boss,
Garrison Cootes, is,

02:37.804 --> 02:39.737
like, the most famous
environmental lawyer

02:39.739 --> 02:40.554
in the world?

02:40.556 --> 02:42.206
Yeah...

02:42.208 --> 02:45.576
I mean, it's him
or the other guy.

02:45.578 --> 02:46.911
Sir Anthony Howel?

02:46.913 --> 02:49.297
Yeah...

02:49.299 --> 02:51.415
Anyway, he's an important guy,
okay?

02:51.417 --> 02:52.984
And so today at work,

02:52.986 --> 02:55.136
I was trying to show him
that I'm tough.

02:55.138 --> 02:56.971
I've been thinking
about this

02:56.973 --> 02:58.222
settlement offer we're about

02:58.224 --> 03:00.308
to get from Gruber
Pharmaceuticals.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.226
If it's anything less
than $20 million,

03:02.228 --> 03:03.293
then I'm gonna grab

03:03.295 --> 03:06.063
those corporate Earth rapists
by their...

03:06.065 --> 03:08.065
Okay, I'm just gonna
say something.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.984
I'm growing a child
in my belly,

03:09.986 --> 03:11.902
a child that just
developed ears.

03:11.904 --> 03:14.572
This is a very
thin sweater.

03:14.574 --> 03:16.324
So please, if you must
tell your story...

03:16.326 --> 03:17.942
just make it
cheerful.

03:17.944 --> 03:19.560
Cheerful.

03:19.562 --> 03:21.696
Okay...

03:21.698 --> 03:23.414
Then I'm gonna grab those
corporate...

03:23.416 --> 03:24.849
employees...

03:24.851 --> 03:26.817
by their sweaty, dangling...

03:26.819 --> 03:27.835
hands...

03:27.837 --> 03:30.487
and squeeze until those greedy
sons of...

03:30.489 --> 03:32.790
parents... realize that
I'm the baddest mother...

03:32.792 --> 03:35.676
nature lover around.

03:35.678 --> 03:38.512
It's like watching
<i>The Breakfast Club</i> on TBS.

03:38.514 --> 03:40.431
So what did he say?

03:40.433 --> 03:45.102
Marshall, bend down so I
can put my arm around you.

03:45.104 --> 03:47.221
That's all the way down.
That's good.

03:47.223 --> 03:49.190
Gruber Pharmaceuticals
is a company full

03:49.192 --> 03:51.142
of well-meaning people
doing their jobs,

03:51.144 --> 03:53.227
just like you and me.

03:53.229 --> 03:55.980
Guys, I'm afraid that Garrison
Cootes has gone soft!

03:55.982 --> 03:57.982
He's like a teddy bear!

03:57.984 --> 04:00.568
A teddy bear
or an Ewok?

04:00.570 --> 04:02.737
You know, cute and cuddly
around the village,

04:02.739 --> 04:04.655
but once the battle starts...

04:04.657 --> 04:08.042
He'll smash in your metal skull
with giant swinging logs.

04:08.044 --> 04:09.160
Marshall!

04:09.162 --> 04:10.411
Okay, he'll hug you

04:10.413 --> 04:12.830
until you agree to peaceably
shut down the Death Star.

04:12.832 --> 04:14.031
Hi, sweetie.

04:14.033 --> 04:15.149
Hey.

04:15.151 --> 04:16.867
What are we
all talking about?

04:16.869 --> 04:17.985
Ewoks.

04:17.987 --> 04:19.253
Ugh, I hate the Ewoks.

04:19.255 --> 04:21.471
The only good
thing about Ewoks in that movie?

04:21.474 --> 04:23.373
You got to see some of them die.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.010
Well, I fancy a pint.

04:27.378 --> 04:28.979
Nora hates Ewoks.

04:28.981 --> 04:30.881
Well, I have
to break up with her.

04:30.883 --> 04:32.917
Be gentle
when you tell her, guys.

04:32.919 --> 04:35.519
I'll call you from Vegas.
Tell me how it went. Okay.

04:35.521 --> 04:36.487
Okay, Barney!

04:36.489 --> 04:37.554
Sit down!

04:37.556 --> 04:38.889
Not liking Ewoks

04:38.891 --> 04:41.409
is no reason not
to date somebody.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.994
Yeah, I mean, who knows
what the rules are, ya know?

04:43.996 --> 04:46.664
I mean, you're dating
a girl who doesn't like Ewoks,

04:46.666 --> 04:48.565
I'm dating my former
therapist.

04:48.567 --> 04:49.617
- Oh!
- Eww!

04:49.619 --> 04:51.452
We are
gentlemen of Harvard!

04:51.454 --> 04:52.886
It's not a big deal!

04:52.911 --> 04:54.699
Robin, if you asked
a hundred people,

04:54.700 --> 04:56.543
"Who's the worst person
you could possibly date?"

04:56.575 --> 04:58.125
they'd all say,
"Your therapist."

04:58.127 --> 04:59.877
Except the ones
saying "Barney."

04:59.879 --> 05:02.263
Hey! Yeah, that tracks.

05:02.265 --> 05:04.081
Well, I should
get going.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.933
I got the big field
trip tomorrow.

05:05.935 --> 05:06.801
Field trip?

05:06.803 --> 05:07.635
Yeah. I'm taking

05:07.637 --> 05:08.803
my Intro to
Architecture class

05:08.805 --> 05:10.354
to the GNB Tower
construction site.

05:10.356 --> 05:11.772
I'm trying to get
them interested

05:11.774 --> 05:13.357
in architecture
as a career.

05:13.359 --> 05:15.425
Why? Are we running out
of buildings?

05:15.427 --> 05:16.894
Are we running out
of boring people?

05:16.896 --> 05:18.646
Guys, this is
a big deal, okay?

05:18.648 --> 05:20.781
If I can get just
one kid interested in

05:20.783 --> 05:21.932
becoming an architect...

05:21.934 --> 05:24.452
Okay, I'm just gonna stop
you right there.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.487
Ted, it's an Intro class.

05:26.489 --> 05:28.691
Yeah, don't try to
<i>Stand and Deliver</i>

05:28.692 --> 05:29.440
an Intro class.

05:29.441 --> 05:32.493
Nobody takes an Intro class
to get on any other path

05:32.495 --> 05:35.246
but the path to not
being hungover anymore.

05:35.248 --> 05:39.333
I learned that in my Intro
to something-ology class.

05:39.335 --> 05:41.752
Well that's fine for
something-ology,

05:41.754 --> 05:44.054
but tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m. sharp

05:44.056 --> 05:47.258
Intro to Architecture is
going on a field trip!

05:47.260 --> 05:48.642
All 200 of 'em.

05:48.644 --> 05:49.660
Well, it's 9:45.

05:49.662 --> 05:52.229
I guess the other 170
of you got lost,

05:52.231 --> 05:53.597
so we'll just start.

05:53.599 --> 05:57.101
Now, some might say you guys are
just taking this class

05:57.103 --> 06:00.571
because it's easy or because
you've confused architecture

06:00.573 --> 06:02.356
with archaeology and think
we're gonna do

06:02.358 --> 06:04.141
some cool
Indiana Jones stuff today.

06:04.143 --> 06:05.943
But I think that...

06:08.330 --> 06:12.666
I think just maybe, we got some
future architects in the house.

06:12.668 --> 06:17.288
Show of hands: who's thinking
about a career in architecture?

06:19.791 --> 06:22.209
Well, today,
all that's gonna change.

06:22.211 --> 06:24.161
Follow me.

06:25.797 --> 06:27.548
Hey. Uh, sorry,

06:27.550 --> 06:29.450
nobody gets in here
without a site pass.

06:29.452 --> 06:33.053
It's okay, I'm Ted Mosby, the
architect of this building.

06:33.055 --> 06:35.472
I don't care if you're the
archaeologist of this building.

06:35.474 --> 06:36.607
Site's closed.

06:42.147 --> 06:43.831
Moving on!

06:45.516 --> 06:46.800
<i>That morning, Marshall's firm</i>

06:46.802 --> 06:48.452
<i>was getting</i>
<i>the settlement offer</i>

06:48.454 --> 06:50.905
<i>from Gruber Pharmaceuticals,</i>
<i>and Marshall couldn't wait</i>

<i>to see the teddy</i> <i>bear</i>
<i>turn into an Ewok.</i>

06:53.960 --> 06:57.861
Gruber Pharmaceuticals dumped
toxic waste into Frog Creek,

06:57.863 --> 07:00.548
a tributary of the Trout River
that feeds into Clearwater Lake.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.717
All three of which
now need new names.

07:04.719 --> 07:09.539
So it's time to win one
for Mother Earth.

07:09.541 --> 07:11.759
Let's take out the trash,
shall we?!

07:11.761 --> 07:14.011
- Yes!
- All right, everyone grab a bag.

07:14.013 --> 07:15.813
Blue is recycling,
green, compost.

07:15.815 --> 07:17.815
There we go.

07:19.184 --> 07:20.884
Sheila...

Yeah , that seems reasonable.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.461
<i>Kids, I</i> <i>was wandering the city</i>

07:53.480 --> 07:57.115
Okay, guys, seeing a building
get built, not that exciting.

07:57.117 --> 07:59.817
What's really exciting is the
financial side of...

07:59.819 --> 08:01.285
Sit down, Ted, I got this.

08:01.287 --> 08:04.539
Hey, Weird Beard, lights!

08:04.541 --> 08:06.824
College...
it's a confusing time.

08:06.826 --> 08:07.925
Oh, no.

08:07.927 --> 08:11.646
Studies show that 83% of all
college students

08:11.648 --> 08:13.681
desperately need...

08:13.683 --> 08:15.667
sex lessons!

08:15.669 --> 08:17.552
Lights!

08:17.554 --> 08:19.704
Barney, these are
18-year-olds!

08:19.706 --> 08:23.040
Ted, these are 18-year-olds!

08:23.042 --> 08:25.376
You have a girlfriend.

08:25.378 --> 08:26.594
But she doesn't like Ewoks!

08:26.596 --> 08:27.478
So what?

08:27.480 --> 08:31.566
So what?!
Bieber, lights!

08:31.568 --> 08:37.105
In 1983, George Lucas introduced
the world to the Ewoks,

08:37.107 --> 08:40.842
a race of creatures indigenous
to the second moon of Endor.

08:40.844 --> 08:42.844
Now, the Ewoks have
a rich back-story

08:42.846 --> 08:44.245
that the movie didn't
really go into.

08:44.246 --> 08:45.413
Barney, why don't
you just skip

08:45.415 --> 08:47.498
to the part
about you and Nora?

08:47.500 --> 08:49.250
Fine.

08:58.677 --> 09:00.077
Ah, yes.

09:00.079 --> 09:04.348
Ultimately, Ewoks split <i>Star</i>
<i>Wars</i> fandom into two camps:

09:04.350 --> 09:09.437
those born before, and those
born after May 25, 1973:

09:09.439 --> 09:12.640
the Ewok Line.

09:12.642 --> 09:15.727
Anyone born on this side
of the Ewok Line was

09:15.729 --> 09:18.129
at least ten years
old when Jedi came out,

09:18.131 --> 09:22.433
and thus too old for something
so cloying and cute.

09:22.435 --> 09:29.373
Anyone born on this side
loved the Ewoks because, why?

09:30.492 --> 09:32.410
They reminded you of...

09:32.412 --> 09:33.494
Our teddies?

09:33.496 --> 09:35.963
They reminded you
of your teddies.

09:35.965 --> 09:37.799
Thank you, Gina.

09:37.801 --> 09:39.584
How do you know her name?

09:39.586 --> 09:44.121
And so... by the immutable laws
of the Ewok Line,

09:44.123 --> 09:48.593
my 29-year-old girlfriend
who hates Ewoks

09:48.595 --> 09:54.315
must in fact be
no younger than... 37.

09:54.317 --> 09:56.601
That's only a year younger
than Will's mom.

09:56.603 --> 09:58.820
How do you know my mom?
Class dismissed!

09:58.822 --> 10:00.321
I need to be alone.

10:00.323 --> 10:01.806
All right, we're moving on.

10:01.808 --> 10:03.191
Ooh, can I come?

10:03.193 --> 10:05.276
Hey, baby.

10:05.278 --> 10:08.780
Hey, I just want to remind you
we have Dr. Sonya at 4:00.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.482
I'll be there. I'm sorry.
I'm just... I'm bummed.

10:11.484 --> 10:14.035
We got
our settlement offer today:

10:14.037 --> 10:17.321
$24,000 from
a billion-dollar company.

10:17.323 --> 10:19.774
Wow. I take it people aren't
happy about that.

10:19.776 --> 10:22.827
We won! Champagne and cake
for everybody!

10:22.829 --> 10:23.961
They're celebrating.

10:23.963 --> 10:24.962
I mean, it's crazy.

10:24.964 --> 10:27.431
We have no right
to be eating cake.

10:27.433 --> 10:29.851
There's cake?! I'm on my way!

10:29.853 --> 10:33.337
<i>Meanwhile, the worst field trip</i>
<i>of all time was still trucking.</i>

10:33.339 --> 10:36.307
All right, this, <i>this</i> is
exciting, okay?

10:36.309 --> 10:37.692
This is the very room

10:37.694 --> 10:40.144
where I had the idea
for the GNB Tower.

10:40.146 --> 10:43.013
Now, Webster's defines
"inspiration" as...

10:43.015 --> 10:45.700
Hold on.
It's still loading.

10:45.702 --> 10:46.701
Uh, hey, roomie.

10:46.703 --> 10:49.403
Robin! Hey,
what are you doing here?

10:49.405 --> 10:52.156
Well, I <i>was</i> about
to get my swerve on.

10:52.158 --> 10:54.041
You were?

10:54.043 --> 10:56.460
So you're the therapist.

10:56.462 --> 10:59.580
You know, it's one thing
to pretend to be a shrink

10:59.582 --> 11:01.632
and bang your patients.
That's normal.

11:01.634 --> 11:05.336
But to do it for real?
A little creepy, bro.

11:05.338 --> 11:06.921
Okay, it's not creepy.

11:06.923 --> 11:09.006
Ehhhh... it's creepy.

11:09.008 --> 11:10.842
Class, show of hands:

11:10.844 --> 11:13.711
Who thinks it's creepy
to date your therapist?

11:13.713 --> 11:15.346
- Pollstered.
- Get out!

11:15.348 --> 11:17.381
All right.
We're moving on!

11:17.383 --> 11:18.716
So, class, to your left,

11:18.718 --> 11:21.402
you will see some
excellent examples of

11:21.404 --> 11:25.072
what we'd call windows.

11:25.074 --> 11:26.908
So where are we going now?

11:26.910 --> 11:27.909
I have no idea.

11:27.911 --> 11:29.410
This is a disaster.

11:29.412 --> 11:31.395
Some of them are already
starting to go home.

11:31.397 --> 11:34.081
Although we seem to have
picked up a German family.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.000
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

11:36.002 --> 11:38.736
That thing with Robin
and her creepy therapist

11:38.738 --> 11:39.737
gave me an idea.

11:39.739 --> 11:41.706
Ted, we have here a way

11:41.708 --> 11:44.575
to solve every single debate
we've ever had!

11:44.577 --> 11:46.410
I mean, just look at the sample:

11:46.412 --> 11:49.463
guys, girls,
blacks, Asians, a German family.

11:49.465 --> 11:52.049
You can't pay for that kind of
focus group!

11:52.051 --> 11:54.752
Is macaroni salad
really a salad?

11:54.754 --> 11:56.253
Hands up if you say "no."

11:57.255 --> 11:58.272
Ha!

11:58.274 --> 11:59.273
Jacob or Edward?

11:59.275 --> 12:00.257
Who says Edward?

12:00.259 --> 12:02.226
Ha, ha. See?
I told you.

12:02.228 --> 12:04.612
It's Edward
James Olmos.

12:04.614 --> 12:08.282
Would you rather have sex
with a dead human being

12:08.284 --> 12:11.035
or a live an...?
Dude.

12:11.037 --> 12:12.603
What?
Find the line.

12:12.605 --> 12:15.072
Who thinks David
Hasselhoff is awesome?

12:16.041 --> 12:17.742
Hmm.
It's true.

12:17.744 --> 12:19.460
Okay. I've got one.
If you're dating a girl,

12:19.462 --> 12:20.962
and she lies
about her age,

12:20.964 --> 12:22.930
who says break up
with her?

12:22.932 --> 12:25.166
Yes, yes, but what if
the person she's lying to

12:25.168 --> 12:27.284
is notoriously
shallow about age?

12:27.286 --> 12:29.637
Okay, but what if early
in our relationship,

12:29.639 --> 12:30.972
she made a really big deal

12:30.974 --> 12:32.590
about wanting to not
lie to each other?

12:33.475 --> 12:34.642
What if she's hot?

12:35.510 --> 12:36.677
Who wants five bucks?

12:37.596 --> 12:39.263
Pollstered!

12:39.265 --> 12:40.765
Let's do this.

12:45.153 --> 12:46.971
Hmm? Yeah.

12:47.991 --> 12:48.990
Mm...

12:48.992 --> 12:50.491
Okay, this is creepy.

12:50.493 --> 12:51.993
It's Crispin
Glover creepy.

12:51.995 --> 12:53.411
You were my patient.

12:53.413 --> 12:54.695
You shared intimate stuff.

12:54.697 --> 12:56.497
It would be like dating
your gynecologist.

12:56.499 --> 12:58.616
You were vulnerable.

12:58.618 --> 13:01.118
That's not something
we can move past.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.287
Guess not.

13:04.206 --> 13:07.508
So, dating your gyno,
that's bad, too?

13:07.510 --> 13:08.676
Oh, Robin.

13:08.678 --> 13:10.378
Kidding!

13:10.380 --> 13:12.079
Look, we've got another one!

13:14.100 --> 13:15.499
Come on,
have a bite.

13:15.501 --> 13:17.385
No, it's a matter
of principle.

13:17.387 --> 13:18.853
I don't care how good it is,

13:18.855 --> 13:20.471
I'm not gonna have
a third piece of cake!

13:20.473 --> 13:24.508
Okay, guys, you all had
a lot of fun today,

13:24.510 --> 13:27.395
but now it's time...
to have even more fun!

13:27.397 --> 13:29.597
Another cake!

13:29.599 --> 13:31.365
Another cake?!

13:31.367 --> 13:33.317
What is the matter
with you people?!

13:33.319 --> 13:37.855
That settlement today was
a flaming pile of...

13:37.857 --> 13:39.757
puppies...

13:39.759 --> 13:41.542
that aren't on fire!

13:41.544 --> 13:43.711
Look at what's happening
to the environment,

13:43.713 --> 13:45.413
and we're here doing the limbo?

13:45.415 --> 13:48.499
I mean, we should be ashamed
of ourselves!

13:56.842 --> 13:59.510
Sir, all I meant was...

13:59.512 --> 14:01.896
Ten years from right now,

14:01.898 --> 14:05.049
everyone outside in that bullpen
will be dead.

14:05.051 --> 14:06.517
What?

14:06.519 --> 14:08.436
I've seen the
latest research, Marsh.

14:08.438 --> 14:10.004
You know how I'm always saying

14:10.006 --> 14:12.023
it's not too late
to save the planet?

14:12.025 --> 14:14.058
It's too late
to save the planet.

14:14.060 --> 14:17.244
There's nothing to do
but sit back

14:17.246 --> 14:20.931
and await our inevitable doom.

14:22.335 --> 14:23.901
Oh, my goodness, a piñata!

14:23.903 --> 14:25.336
Just give me one minute, Larry.

14:25.338 --> 14:26.904
Thank you.

14:26.906 --> 14:30.257
Our grotesque, inevitable doom!

14:31.209 --> 14:33.044
Now, of course,
you can't go around

14:33.046 --> 14:34.095
telling all the people

14:34.097 --> 14:35.846
that the good ship
<i>Environmentalism</i>

14:35.848 --> 14:37.414
has sailed off into the sunset.

14:37.416 --> 14:39.050
There would cause a panic.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.901
So, instead,
what we do is,

14:40.903 --> 14:43.354
we come to work,
we put on a happy face,

14:43.356 --> 14:45.606
and we sue the big guys

14:45.608 --> 14:48.092
for just enough money
for some cake

14:48.094 --> 14:52.563
before the unfiltered rays
of the sun fry us like chalupas,

14:52.565 --> 14:55.533
and our lungs fill up
with salt water,

14:55.535 --> 14:57.952
and we all die!

14:57.954 --> 15:00.538
Mmm. This cake is delicious.
Everything's fine.

15:04.714 --> 15:05.764
Ugh, this day sucks.

15:06.380 --> 15:08.213
Kevin and I are kaputski.

15:08.215 --> 15:09.831
You think that's bad?

15:09.833 --> 15:12.167
The world is
coming to an end.

15:12.169 --> 15:14.069
You think that's bad?

15:14.071 --> 15:18.206
My girlfriend is 37!

15:18.208 --> 15:21.510
And my field trip is not going
as well as I'd hoped.

15:21.512 --> 15:23.662
Hmm.

15:23.664 --> 15:25.564
This day sucks.

15:25.566 --> 15:28.183
Professor Mosby,
is the field trip over?

15:28.185 --> 15:30.018
We'd like to go home.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.603
Yeah, it's over.

15:31.605 --> 15:33.772
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

15:33.774 --> 15:35.440
I just wanted
to inspire them,

15:35.442 --> 15:38.893
you know, like my professors
inspired me.

15:38.895 --> 15:42.114
But here we are,
at the end of the day...

15:42.116 --> 15:43.665
Hey, class,
quick question.

15:43.667 --> 15:46.418
Uh, is anyone here thinking
of becoming an architect?

15:51.624 --> 15:53.759
Really?

15:53.761 --> 15:55.928
Yeah, dude.
I mean,

15:55.930 --> 15:57.579
all jobs suck,

15:57.581 --> 15:59.581
but it's 4:00
in the afternoon,

15:59.583 --> 16:01.550
and you're out at a bar
with your friends,

16:01.552 --> 16:03.769
so the hours can't
be that bad.

16:03.771 --> 16:05.387
So...

16:05.389 --> 16:07.773
yeah, I don't know,
I'd think about it.

16:07.775 --> 16:11.092
I got through to you. Oh!

16:11.094 --> 16:14.763
I mean, that is, if becoming
a deejay doesn't pan out.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.983
You are gonna be
a great architect.

16:17.985 --> 16:20.101
<i>He became a deejay.</i>

16:22.772 --> 16:24.072
Robin, what are you doing here?

16:24.074 --> 16:25.614
I told you I can't
be your therapist.

16:25.639 --> 16:26.459
I know.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.943
Today, I am your therapist.

16:28.945 --> 16:29.944
What?

16:29.946 --> 16:31.163
You said yourself,

16:31.165 --> 16:33.415
I'm always looking for reasons
not to be happy.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.334
Well, I'm trying to change that.

16:35.336 --> 16:37.452
So, if the only reason
we can't be together

16:37.454 --> 16:39.454
is because I was
in a vulnerable place

16:39.456 --> 16:41.139
for the first two hours
we knew each other

16:41.141 --> 16:45.427
then that is two hours of
vulnerability you owe me.

16:46.312 --> 16:47.346
Sit down.

16:47.348 --> 16:49.297
Okay.

16:49.299 --> 16:53.819
Okay, but I must warn you, as a
professional, I'm immune to...

16:53.821 --> 16:54.786
Tell me about your mother.

16:54.811 --> 16:56.934
Everything she says
is a manipulation!

16:56.973 --> 16:58.273
When I was
seven years old...

16:58.275 --> 16:59.941
Mr. Cootes.

16:59.943 --> 17:01.827
- Hey.
- Listen, I've been thinking

17:01.829 --> 17:03.745
a lot about what you said
yesterday,

17:03.747 --> 17:05.280
about how we're all gonna die.

17:05.281 --> 17:06.580
Oh, I'm not gonna die.

17:06.583 --> 17:09.701
I bought an old mine shaft
in Colorado.

17:09.703 --> 17:12.738
I've spent the last six months
filling it with canned goods,

17:12.740 --> 17:15.874
assault rifles and all five
seasons of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i>

17:15.876 --> 17:18.760
Okay, first of all,
you can skip season two.

17:18.762 --> 17:22.163
Second of all, after our talk...

17:22.165 --> 17:25.751
I came pretty close
to giving up myself.

17:25.752 --> 17:29.304
But then I went to the doctor
with my wife...

17:29.306 --> 17:30.305
and...

17:31.642 --> 17:33.942
I saw this.

17:35.945 --> 17:38.380
Boy or girl?

17:38.382 --> 17:40.515
I don't know.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.285
But I know I sure as hell
can't give up now.

17:43.287 --> 17:45.737
So, if you're just looking
for someone

17:45.739 --> 17:48.123
to hold the other end
of the limbo stick,

17:48.125 --> 17:51.209
you got the wrong guy for
the job, and you know why?

17:51.211 --> 17:53.962
'Cause you're three feet taller
than everyone in this office?

17:53.964 --> 17:56.965
No. Because if I am
gonna work here,

17:56.967 --> 17:58.800
then first thing
tomorrow morning,

17:58.802 --> 18:00.869
I'm walking down
to Gruber Pharmaceuticals,

18:00.871 --> 18:02.838
and I'm rejecting their offer.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.173
Even if I have to do it myself.

18:07.177 --> 18:11.680
Listen, I want you
to know... I know.

18:11.682 --> 18:12.681
Know what?

18:12.683 --> 18:14.282
Nora.

18:14.284 --> 18:15.684
Barney.

18:15.686 --> 18:16.718
Nora.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.219
Just say what you're gonna say!

18:18.221 --> 18:19.604
I know you're old!

18:19.606 --> 18:22.157
And I've been struggling
with it,

18:22.159 --> 18:25.059
but when I look at you...

18:25.061 --> 18:27.395
I don't care,
because I really like you.

18:27.397 --> 18:32.567
And because for 37,
you are keeping it toit!

18:32.569 --> 18:34.870
You think I'm 37?

18:34.872 --> 18:36.822
Well, if you were really 29,

18:36.847 --> 18:38.117
then you would have
been a little kid

18:38.125 --> 18:41.009
the first time you saw the Ewoks
and you would have loved them.

18:41.011 --> 18:42.474
Barney, I didn't see
any of the <i>Star Wars</i>

18:42.499 --> 18:43.944
movies until last year.

18:44.080 --> 18:48.884
You... you're 29!

18:50.052 --> 18:52.086
You still have
one good year left.

18:52.088 --> 18:54.272
- What?
- Nothing.

18:54.274 --> 18:55.807
Mm...

18:55.809 --> 18:57.476
But Naveen's the neurosurgeon,

18:57.478 --> 18:59.594
so of course he gets
all the attention!

18:59.596 --> 19:00.896
Oh, Naveen is so smart,

19:00.898 --> 19:03.815
he operates on people's brains!

19:03.817 --> 19:05.901
Well, guess what, Mom?!

19:05.903 --> 19:08.620
I treat the human mind!

19:08.622 --> 19:10.622
Our time is up.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.708
I don't think
this is gonna work.

19:13.710 --> 19:15.410
I scared you off, didn't I?

19:15.412 --> 19:19.164
No, I mean, I don't think
I can be your therapist.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.800
You're really cute.

19:23.069 --> 19:24.486
<i>The next day,</i>

19:24.488 --> 19:26.671
<i>Marshall returned to</i>
<i>Gruber Pharmaceuticals alone.</i>

19:26.673 --> 19:29.791
I mean, you admit
that you polluted the lake.

19:29.793 --> 19:30.959
We got the evidence.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.961
We got the charts.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.147
The fish...

19:36.566 --> 19:38.683
Fish, huh?

19:38.685 --> 19:40.569
Fish are weird.

19:40.571 --> 19:43.205
You ever think
about the names of fish?

19:43.207 --> 19:44.689
I mean, come on.

19:44.691 --> 19:45.974
Carp.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.910
Garrison, what a nice surprise.

19:48.912 --> 19:51.413
Your star apprentice
was just, uh...

19:51.415 --> 19:53.081
"Floundering."

19:53.083 --> 19:55.083
Little, little
fish humor

19:55.085 --> 19:56.418
for you guys.

19:56.420 --> 19:57.752
It was not going well.

19:57.754 --> 20:00.455
I'm here to turn
down the 24,000.

20:00.457 --> 20:04.342
Well, I can maybe get you
24,500.

20:04.344 --> 20:09.881
Not... good... enough.

20:14.070 --> 20:16.170
Where are we going?

20:16.172 --> 20:18.440
To war, son.

20:18.442 --> 20:21.226
We're going to war.

20:22.678 --> 20:25.397
We're going to save the planet.

20:25.399 --> 20:30.485
<i>And kids, as we now know,</i>
<i>they did.</i>

20:33.305 --> 20:34.772
Hey, you know
what was on last night?

20:34.774 --> 20:36.144
- <i>Stand and Deliver.</i>
- Mm.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.369
- So good.
- Mm-hmm.

20:37.693 --> 20:40.344
Whatever happened
to Jacob James Olmos?

20:40.346 --> 20:41.545
Who?

20:41.547 --> 20:44.515
Jacob James Olmos.
Whatever happened to that guy?

20:44.517 --> 20:46.216
He never existed.

20:46.218 --> 20:47.484
It's Edward James Olmos.

20:47.486 --> 20:49.186
You're Olmos correct.

20:49.188 --> 20:51.555
It's Jacob James Olmos.

20:51.557 --> 20:53.607
- It's Edward James Olmos.
- Jacob James Olmos.

20:53.609 --> 20:55.278
Edward James Olmos.

20:55.303 --> 20:56.320
- You're joking, right...?
- Are you serious...?

20:56.345 --> 20:58.106
- Seriously.
- Jacob James Olmos.
