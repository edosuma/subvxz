00:05.606 --> 00:07.075
[Payson] Previously
on Make It Or Break It:

00:07.108 --> 00:10.344
[Payson] Sasha,
you inspire me.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.413
Payson!

00:12.446 --> 00:15.749
[Steve] You knew they were
having sex and didn't tell me.

00:15.783 --> 00:19.353
- Can you forgive me?
- I don't think I can.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.390
- Come on, take one bite.
- If I'm not hungry,
I'm not hungry.

00:22.423 --> 00:26.026
You told Leslie not to come!
Lauren was so excited
to see her,

00:26.060 --> 00:29.263
- and you scared her off!
- [Damon] In two years,
we'll meet here,

00:29.297 --> 00:32.566
under the Eiffel Tower.
Then we'll decide
if it's goodbye.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.568
- Where's Mom?
- She's at her new job.

00:34.602 --> 00:38.239
My brother is having
seizure symptoms tonight.
He needs his meds.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.076
You're under arrest.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.440
[dialing]

01:12.473 --> 01:16.110
Look, I know I'm calling
you out of the blue,

01:16.144 --> 01:21.182
but, um...
I'm in really big trouble.

01:21.215 --> 01:25.453
You know, isn't justice
supposed to be swift and speedy?

01:25.486 --> 01:29.757
I mean, you guys have been
holding Miss Kmetko
for quite a while now.

01:29.790 --> 01:34.162
Miss Kmetko is a minor and must
be released to a legal guardian.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.664
Yeah, OK.

01:36.697 --> 01:42.370
But what exactly makes
me an illegal guardian, huh?

01:42.403 --> 01:46.307
We finally got a hold
of her mother. She's on
her way in right now.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.777
Hey, Emily,
how you doing?

01:49.810 --> 01:53.447
Ridiculously bad.
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.517
I couldn't get a hold
of my mom and I didn't
know who else to call.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.320
Everybody knows
I'm the bail-out guy.

02:00.254 --> 02:04.392
Emily? Thank God you're OK!

02:04.425 --> 02:07.595
- Mom, where were you?
- I was at my new job,

02:07.628 --> 02:11.098
answering phones for the
emergency response center.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.633
And you couldn't
get messages there?

02:12.666 --> 02:15.636
They make us turn
off our cell phones

02:15.669 --> 02:19.373
so that our personal emergencies
don't distract us from
other people's emergencies.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.741
Don't try to change the subject!

02:20.774 --> 02:23.211
What were you thinking
stealing medicine?!

02:23.244 --> 02:26.414
You were nowhere to be
found and Brian needed
his meds right away!

02:26.447 --> 02:28.682
What was I supposed to do?!

02:28.716 --> 02:33.687
Ladies, ladies, perhaps we
should just take this outside?

02:45.399 --> 02:50.204
Brought you some fruit
and a cranberry flaxseed
muffin, your favorite.

02:50.238 --> 02:53.774
- Yum.
- Honey, you barely touched
your dinner last night.

02:53.807 --> 02:58.612
- You've gotta be starving.
- Mom, I'm the number-one
gymnast in the country,

02:58.646 --> 03:02.416
and nailing moves that
only one other girl
in the world can land.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.219
Now, does that sound like
somebody who's under-
nourished to you?

03:05.253 --> 03:09.290
[laughs] I, uh, can't
really argue with that.

03:09.323 --> 03:14.228
But you do need
your fuel for the day.
So... come on, eat up.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.744
I kissed my coach, Mom.
Kissed him!

03:30.778 --> 03:32.680
He was freaked.
I'm freaked!

03:32.713 --> 03:35.249
How am I supposed
to continue working with him
like nothing ever happened?

03:35.283 --> 03:37.851
How can I even face him?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.521
Sasha is a smart
and well-adjusted man.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.857
I'm sure he will handle this
in the best possible way.

03:43.891 --> 03:47.628
And he's already said he doesn't
want it to derail your training.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.498
- You talked to him?
- Of course.
He called me immediately.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.567
- He's worried about you.
- Have you talked to
anyone else about this?

03:53.601 --> 03:57.738
No, I swear.
You have a crush, Pay.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.608
Had. Had a crush.
It's over, OK?

04:00.641 --> 04:04.712
Crushes don't
disappear over night.
And they're completely normal.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.948
Yeah, well, I'm the one
who let herself get all
caught up in the moment.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.619
And that's all it was,
just a stupid moment.

04:11.652 --> 04:16.757
Payson, in time,
you will look back on
this day and laugh.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.626
I seriously doubt that.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.762
Every time I remember it,
I practically freak out.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.565
Ugh. If anybody else
finds out about this,
I will die.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.671
Yippee, I'm the
first one here.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.741
See, now, I thought you were the
first one here every morning.

04:33.774 --> 04:39.380
But silly me, you were having
sex in your meditation room
with that mop-haired air brain.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.482
Do you know how
unfunny you are?

04:41.515 --> 04:45.419
I'll work on my act for when
I pick you up after practice.

04:45.453 --> 04:49.623
This is ridiculous!
Carter and I broke up.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.925
He isn't even
in Boulder this week.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.596
He's with the rest
of the boys at the Men's
Invitational in Dallas.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.031
Like it or not, I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.668
Why, because you suddenly care
about being a good father?

05:00.701 --> 05:05.706
[sighs] Because I don't want
to see you make mistakes
that might ruin your life.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.743
You ruined my life when
you let Summer walk out
on us at Nationals.

05:09.777 --> 05:13.313
I finally thought I was
going to have a mother,
and then it was just over.

05:13.347 --> 05:17.418
Lauren, I'm sorry things didn't
work out between Summer and me.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.319
And I'm sorry
that disappointed you.

05:19.353 --> 05:23.757
But Summer's made it
pretty darn clear she
wants nothing to do with me.

05:23.791 --> 05:27.928
I just, I can't accept that.
There has to be some way.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.830
We just can't give up.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.652
[gasps]

05:51.685 --> 05:54.422
No freaking way!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.803
- What are you smiling about?
- Nothing.

06:42.836 --> 06:46.106
- [Emily sighs]
- You look a little tired.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.976
Were you up consoling
your poor mom

06:49.009 --> 06:50.811
after my dad dumped her?

06:50.844 --> 06:54.114
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't know?

06:54.147 --> 06:57.084
It's for real this time.
I heard the whole thing.

06:57.117 --> 07:02.456
Honestly, I'm really not
in the mood for your
crap today, Lauren.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.696
So do you rehearse these little,
evil performances

07:08.729 --> 07:10.831
or they just come to you
on the spot?

07:39.092 --> 07:42.930
- How's Payson?
- Well, she's...

07:42.963 --> 07:46.433
Yeah. Me, too.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.069
I don't know whether to
address it or to give her space.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.505
But if I give her space,
I don't want her to
think I'm avoiding her.

07:51.539 --> 07:55.075
Maybe we should talk about it,
the three of us.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.778
Yeah, you're right.
We just need to
get it out in the open,

07:57.811 --> 08:00.213
clear the air and move on.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.783
- [Summer] Good morning!
- [Sasha] Morning.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.685
So I have some interesting
news regarding

08:04.718 --> 08:06.687
the Parents Board election
for tomorrow night.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.090
I did a straw poll,
among the gym parents,
to see who's favored.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.725
What does all this mean?

08:11.759 --> 08:15.162
Well, it looks like you
and Steve are neck-and-neck.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.898
So we're close.
That's good news, right?

08:17.931 --> 08:20.934
Wrong. Neck-and-neck means
you're not winning yet.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.036
Look, if Steve becomes
the Board president,

08:23.070 --> 08:24.772
he'll basically just hand
The Rock over,

08:24.805 --> 08:26.707
lock stock and barrel,
to Ellen Beals.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.810
- And goodbye Sasha.
- And hello Ellen.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.146
After what she did to Payson,
I will not allow that woman

08:33.180 --> 08:36.884
to have any more power over my
daughter than she already has.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.252
Which is why you have
to win this election.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.222
OK, so, what do I do?
Start kissing babies?

08:42.255 --> 08:44.992
No. Just Alex Cruz.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.095
He hasn't endorsed anyone yet,
and as the former president,

08:48.128 --> 08:52.833
- he carries a lot of weight.
- I have to schmooze Alex Cruz?

08:52.866 --> 08:57.204
I'd rather cover myself
in paper cuts and jump
into a pool of lemon juice.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.876
[rock music plays]

09:21.261 --> 09:25.065
Kaylie, I'm worried you
might still be losing weight
to master this Genji Cho move.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.200
I want to make sure
you're not overdoing it.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.569
You don't need this move
to win at Worlds.

09:29.603 --> 09:34.274
Ellen Beals thinks
my training schedule
and my diet are perfect.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.176
And what do you care, anyways?

09:36.209 --> 09:39.112
What's going on
with you, Kaylie?

09:39.146 --> 09:42.249
Nothing. I'm fine.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.721
Now, with your permission, I'd
like to get back to my training.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.591
Go on.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.268
[doorbell rings]

10:07.841 --> 10:11.078
- Hello, Steve.
- Leslie!

10:20.220 --> 10:22.756
I apologize
for just showing up.

10:22.790 --> 10:26.894
Yeah, what the hell
were you thinking?

10:26.927 --> 10:28.729
What if Lauren were home?

10:28.762 --> 10:31.665
Actually, I was hoping
that Lauren would be home.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.872
I have a right to see
my own daughter, Steve.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.008
And since you refuse
to return my calls...

10:41.041 --> 10:44.277
- Still the victim, huh?
- It's not like Lauren
doesn't want to see me.

10:44.311 --> 10:48.081
She invited me to Nationals,
but you kept me away
with your nasty threats.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.719
It amazes me how you manage

10:51.752 --> 10:54.688
to still ruin my life.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.257
Even all the way
from North Carolina.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.159
I'm here to see Lauren,

10:59.192 --> 11:01.261
and I will not let you
scare me away anymore.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.832
You seem to forget there's
still a restraining order

11:04.865 --> 11:07.334
forbidding you from having
any contact with Lauren.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.937
That was granted
when I was still using.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.773
I promise you, Steve, I've been
sober for over two years now.

11:12.806 --> 11:17.945
Yeah, I believed that,
once upon a time.

11:17.978 --> 11:22.382
Then I took you back
and you left us again.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.217
Face it.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.219
You're a pathetic,
weak woman

11:26.253 --> 11:29.256
who chose drugs
over her own family.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.291
Twice.

11:32.292 --> 11:37.130
Well... I'm ready
to make amends.

11:37.164 --> 11:41.268
Well, I'm not ready to give you
a chance at a third strike.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.137
You can see her in two years,
when she's 18.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.440
Steve, that's two more years
for her to wonder why

11:47.474 --> 11:49.743
her mother hasn't seen her!

11:49.777 --> 11:53.346
Two more years for her to harden
against me. Steve, please!

11:53.380 --> 11:55.949
Think of our girl.

12:00.253 --> 12:04.724
If you try to see Lauren
without my permission,
I'll have you arrested.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.198
You'll regret this, Steve.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.867
And I know what
regret feels like.

12:13.901 --> 12:18.471
Believe me, that's a bitch
you don't want to live with.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.915
I can't believe you drove me all
the way to the gym this morning

12:27.948 --> 12:30.217
and didn't even tell me that
Steve Tanner broke up with you.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.219
So I could hear
you say, "I told you so"?

12:32.252 --> 12:35.055
Besides, we have more
important things to
worry about right now.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.890
Oh, the court called
with your hearing date.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.192
Mom! Not here!

12:39.226 --> 12:41.962
I can't have anybody
knowing I got arrested.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.197
I'm sorry.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.267
Oh, God. How did everything
get so screwed up?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.136
A few weeks ago,
I thought I had it all,

12:49.169 --> 12:50.470
and now my spot
on the National Team

12:50.503 --> 12:51.905
is hanging by a thread,

12:51.939 --> 12:53.506
I'm back working
at the Pizza Shack

12:53.540 --> 12:55.909
and I might have
a criminal record.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.311
I can't imagine
being a bigger loser.

12:58.345 --> 13:02.315
- [horn honks]
- Hey, super star. Need a ride?

13:02.349 --> 13:03.383
[rock music plays in car]

13:03.416 --> 13:05.986
[gasps]

13:13.193 --> 13:16.296
So are we far enough away
from the gym for me
to say a proper hello?

13:16.329 --> 13:18.198
[sighs]

13:22.269 --> 13:25.405
Look at you.
You are such a rock star,

13:25.438 --> 13:29.242
with your fancy car
and your skinny jeans

13:29.276 --> 13:31.444
and your funky T-shirt.
[laughs]

13:31.478 --> 13:33.380
It's more than just a shirt.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.348
So I'm supporting
a group called truth.

13:35.382 --> 13:38.118
It's all about exposing the
truth about tobacco companies.

13:38.151 --> 13:43.290
Here, I, uh,
brought you a bag.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.225
- Thanks.
- Mm.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.128
I can't believe
you're back in Boulder.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.098
So, what do you think
of my pimped-out wheels?

13:51.131 --> 13:56.003
[laughs] Pretty,
uh, swanky, I guess.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.138
Um, did you buy it?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.407
- No, it's a rental.
- [laughs]

14:00.440 --> 14:02.876
My, uh, new label's
paying for it.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.812
- Your new label?
- Yeah.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.916
I got a record deal!

14:08.949 --> 14:12.285
Oh, my God!
That is amazing!

14:13.320 --> 14:14.955
Wow.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.256
Yeah, that's why I had
to leave the tour.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.858
I go to a studio in LA and
start recording in ten days.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.361
So I thought I'd stop in Boulder
and celebrate with you.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.831
I am so happy for you.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.366
You're really coming
into your own.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.302
I'm happy for both of us.
I mean, look at us, Emily!

14:29.336 --> 14:32.305
We're both on our way
to the top of the world.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.320
Do we have to talk about this?
Can't we just pretend
like it never happened?

14:47.354 --> 14:49.056
We have to recognize it did
happen and clear the air.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.858
We just want you to be honest
about your feelings

14:51.891 --> 14:53.260
so we can help you through them.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.495
And you guys have
to trust me when I say

14:55.528 --> 14:58.165
I don't have any feelings
and I just want to get
on with my training.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.466
That's all I want
for you as well.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.234
You're making such
incredible progress,

15:01.268 --> 15:04.404
- I don't want anything
to derail that.
- Me either.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.173
Good, so we're
all in agreement.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.408
Starting tomorrow,
we can get back to business.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.913
I think that's the best
we can hope for right now.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.884
Oh, Summer.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.587
Now that my dad
broke up with Chloe,

15:20.620 --> 15:24.958
I was wondering if maybe
we could all have dinner
together tonight?

15:24.992 --> 15:29.629
- You know, like old times?
- Lauren, it's... it's never
gonna be like old times.

15:31.098 --> 15:34.901
I don't believe that.
You and my dad were engaged.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.504
It's obvious you
belong together.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.473
Come on, doesn't your finger
feel just a little bit naked

15:40.507 --> 15:42.409
without that big,
shiny rock on it?

15:42.442 --> 15:46.513
Lauren, I'm...
I'm seeing someone else.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.648
You told me you were single.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.617
Well, I didn't
wanna upset you and...

15:50.650 --> 15:52.085
Well, who is it?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.587
I'd rather not say.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.991
You're lying.
You're not seeing anybody.

15:58.025 --> 16:01.928
- Lauren...
- Well, then...

16:01.961 --> 16:04.064
Tell me who.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.137
I'm seeing Sasha.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.604
What?!

16:11.638 --> 16:14.241
How could you date my coach?
That's totally wrong!

16:14.274 --> 16:15.575
You were almost my mother!

16:15.608 --> 16:18.978
But, Lauren,
I'm not your mother.

16:19.012 --> 16:22.115
You promised that you'd
always be there for me.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.251
And obviously that
was just a big load of BS.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.987
I am here for you.
You know that.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.956
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna marry your father.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.460
You want Sasha over my father?

16:33.493 --> 16:36.363
He's not even a Christian.
He's not the man for you.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.999
- He's a good man, Lauren.
- How can you say that?

16:40.033 --> 16:42.469
He's keeping you
from being my mom!

16:42.502 --> 16:44.971

You're not here for me.

16:45.004 --> 16:49.176
If you were really
here for me,

16:49.209 --> 16:52.712
you wouldn't have dumped
my father for my coach.

We don't officially work
together until tomorrow.

Hey, it could be worse.

I had you all to myself.

The last time I saw Damon,

18:34.214 --> 18:36.583
I was the number three gymnast
in the country

18:36.616 --> 18:40.620
with a major sports endowment,
which ended up being a fraud.

I'm working here

I hesitated just now.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.589
You never would
have done that before.

26:30.623 --> 26:32.224
You're afraid to touch me,
and it's all my fault.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.559

26:33.592 --> 26:36.629
No. No, you haven't.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.166
You know...

26:42.702 --> 26:44.671
...we've never
talked about my coach.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.806
Your dad?

26:46.839 --> 26:49.075
No. Uh...

26:49.108 --> 26:51.110
That didn't work out so well.

26:51.143 --> 26:53.612
He wasn't a good coach?

26:53.646 --> 26:56.315
He was, in some ways,
the best.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.617
And what happened?

26:58.651 --> 27:02.588
He'll never forgive me for
winning the gold for England
and not Romania.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.792
- Wow.
- But the coach
I replaced him with

27:05.825 --> 27:08.961
became the most
important person in my life.

27:08.995 --> 27:12.231
- Nicolae Kobori.
- You dedicated
your biography to him.

27:12.264 --> 27:16.035
- "Nicolae the Great."
- That relationship
was based on trust

27:16.068 --> 27:19.972
and loyalty and admiration,
even a certain kind of love.

27:22.675 --> 27:26.879
You know, I was... I was just
an arrogant, little punk,

27:26.913 --> 27:31.183
but he taught me what it
meant to be an athlete.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.686
He pushed me
beyond my limits,

27:33.720 --> 27:39.291
harbored my dream.
He made me an Olympian.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.160
And if he was
"Nicollette the Great,"

27:41.193 --> 27:42.795
I would have tried
to kiss him, too.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.196
[chuckles]

27:45.698 --> 27:49.836
A coach and his athlete
is like no other
relationship I know.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.971
It is intense and intimate,

27:52.004 --> 27:54.173
and sometimes confusing
and complicated.

27:54.206 --> 27:58.711
And there are bumps in the road,
like any other relationship.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.247
But together,
we can overcome any obstacle,

28:01.280 --> 28:04.784
as long as we communicate
and trust in each other.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.453
I trust you, Payson.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.791
I trust you, too.

28:13.259 --> 28:16.328
You see, you haven't
ruined anything.

28:16.362 --> 28:20.699
And I expect to see
my name on the dedication
page of your biography.

28:20.733 --> 28:23.302
- Deal?
- I don't know, Belov.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.403
We'll see if you make the cut.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.373

28:29.241 --> 28:33.012
I got to be honest. I don't know
just how pro-Sasha I am.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.981
I'm not asking you
to vote for Sasha.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.215
I'm asking you to vote for me.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.383
We both know you
stand behind him.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.351
Is that gonna change
when you become president?

28:39.385 --> 28:41.788
No. But as president
of the Board,

28:41.821 --> 28:44.223
I will listen to arguments
for all sides.

28:44.256 --> 28:47.794
You think Steve Tanner's gonna
listen to anyone but himself
if he gets elected?

28:47.827 --> 28:49.728
No, I don't.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.163
You know me, Alex.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.800
My only agenda is to do
what's best for our girls.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.401
All our girls.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.909
[up-tempo music plays]

29:02.942 --> 29:05.377
OK, uh, you don't
really look like a girl

29:05.411 --> 29:08.480
whose boyfriend
just blew into town.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.819
So how was the
big date last night?

29:12.852 --> 29:15.721
It was a disaster.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.858
He doesn't understand
why I couldn't take money
from Steve Tanner.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.493
What, he thinks it's cool
that you're being pimped out

29:21.527 --> 29:23.495
by the guy
who's dating your mom?

29:23.529 --> 29:25.197
Doesn't really
sound like Damon.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.266
Yeah, well, I guess the view
is different from up there

29:27.299 --> 29:29.501
- than it is down here.
- Whoa! Wait.

29:29.535 --> 29:32.471
This is exactly the same
issue you two had before.

29:32.504 --> 29:36.108
But it was Damon that
was all bent outta shape

29:36.142 --> 29:38.444
because his Hollywood deal
went south.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.847
- It's not the same at all.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.749
He didn't get
arrested either, right?

29:43.782 --> 29:46.352
Oh, God.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.821
Have you told him about that,
by the way?

29:48.855 --> 29:51.357
No. I couldn't.
And I can't.

29:51.390 --> 29:55.027
No, I get it. You want to
feel big with him, not small.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.331
- Yeah.
- But with me,

29:59.365 --> 30:01.333
you can show up
just the way that you are.

30:03.802 --> 30:08.540
OK, look. I'll help you with
the whole "feeling big" thing.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.977
Maybe we could put you
in a pair of heels?

30:11.010 --> 30:13.279
You could stand on a box?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.381
Or... You know, yeah.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.483
You can eat
a whole bunch of this,

30:17.516 --> 30:18.985
and gain a bunch of weight.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.153
You are such a dork!

30:21.187 --> 30:24.056
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

30:24.090 --> 30:27.159
- [laughing]
- Don't start something
that you're gonna regret.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.228
- No, no, no!
- No, it's too late!

30:29.261 --> 30:31.830
- [screaming]
- Seriously? Peppers?

30:31.864 --> 30:35.401
- That is just uncalled for!
- [both shouting, laughing]

30:35.434 --> 30:37.469
Salami? Oh, you want some?

30:37.503 --> 30:41.807
We have let this gym
become a dictatorship,

30:41.840 --> 30:44.476
and the fuehrer in charge
is named Sasha Belov!

30:44.510 --> 30:46.345
[murmuring]

30:46.378 --> 30:49.348
Did he just compare
Sasha to Hitler?

30:49.381 --> 30:51.450
We need to take
control of this gym!

30:51.483 --> 30:54.020
Take control
of our kids' futures!

30:54.053 --> 30:58.057
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why I'm running
for Board president.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.192
Thank you.

31:00.226 --> 31:03.362
[scattered applause]

31:03.395 --> 31:08.400
And now, we'll hear from the
other candidate for president of
the Parents Board, Kim Keeler.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.502
- Thank you.
- [applause]

31:10.536 --> 31:12.138
Thanks.

31:12.171 --> 31:15.407
Uh, it seems like this election
has become about Coach Belov.

31:15.441 --> 31:19.845
And I work with him every day.
I can honestly tell you,

31:19.878 --> 31:23.449
I feel he's a great coach.
But as president,

31:23.482 --> 31:26.385
it would be my job
to hear your concerns,

31:26.418 --> 31:29.488
whether they're about Sasha
or anything else at this gym.

31:29.521 --> 31:33.625
And you can count on me
to support your needs.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.862
I'm a mom,
that's what I do.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.098
Thanks. And that's
really all I have to say.

31:39.131 --> 31:42.001
- [applause]
- [mouths] Good job.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.473
Before we vote,

31:47.506 --> 31:49.475
I'd like to endorse Kim Keeler.

31:49.508 --> 31:53.412
- Thank you.
- Um, I second that.

31:53.445 --> 31:58.684
- My vote is for Kim.
- And, uh, mine, too.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.521
[applause]

32:05.191 --> 32:07.893
Would anyone else
like to say something?

32:07.926 --> 32:10.462
- [Beals] I would.
- [crowd murmuring]

32:12.531 --> 32:15.334
Excuse me,
this is Rock business.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.502
Your opinion
isn't relevant here.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.170
True.

32:18.204 --> 32:20.472
But I do have some information

32:20.506 --> 32:23.509
that is relevant
to the parents of the gym.

32:23.542 --> 32:27.379
About their coach and his
inappropriate conduct.

32:27.413 --> 32:30.382
What exactly do you mean
by inappropriate conduct?

32:30.416 --> 32:34.953
I'm uncomfortable divulging
the details at this time.

32:34.987 --> 32:39.158
But I will say that I was
presented with clear evidence

32:39.191 --> 32:44.530
of Sasha Belov engaging
in something that was...

32:44.563 --> 32:48.067
...disturbing to myself,

32:48.100 --> 32:51.137
and the National Committee.

32:51.170 --> 32:55.274
If you have evidence of any
real misconduct by Sasha,

32:55.307 --> 32:59.111
I think we, as parents,
have a right to know what it is.

32:59.145 --> 33:04.683
Mrs. Keeler, I really don't
think you want me to do that.

33:04.716 --> 33:07.453
Because you don't
have anything on Sasha.

33:07.486 --> 33:11.090
You're just trying to get
Steve Tanner elected
so he can get rid of Sasha

33:11.123 --> 33:13.092
and you can
take control of The Rock.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.495
[Beals] You leave me no choice.

33:18.330 --> 33:22.000
I'm truly sorry
to do this publicly,

33:22.034 --> 33:25.737
but if you need proof,
here it is.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.573
[crowd gasping]

33:31.477 --> 33:33.579
- [woman] Oh, my God.
- [clears throat]

33:38.250 --> 33:40.686
That photo is a
misrepresentation.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.456
I know all about this.
It's completely innocent.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.726
You knew about this,
and you did nothing about it?

33:47.759 --> 33:52.064
- It was just a crush.
- [laughs] Just a crush?

33:52.098 --> 33:57.669
So I guess it's OK for our
daughters to kiss their coaches,

33:57.703 --> 34:02.208
or teachers, as long
as they just have a crush?

34:02.241 --> 34:06.578
She's trying to turn this
whole thing into something
awful or dirty,

34:06.612 --> 34:11.350
- and it's just not.
- Look, I understand

34:11.383 --> 34:14.553
there are certain parents
who are very invested

34:14.586 --> 34:17.123
in their kid's success,

34:17.156 --> 34:21.427
and their ambition might
cause them to turn a blind eye.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.463
But is that the kind
of parent you want

34:24.496 --> 34:27.133
as the president of your Board?

34:27.166 --> 34:29.568
[Kim] That's outrageous!
You know us.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.670
You know we're not
those parents. We're...

34:34.606 --> 34:37.776
Hey, folks, um...

34:37.809 --> 34:39.545
Look...

34:41.447 --> 34:44.316
- I move we get on
with the vote...
- [man] I second that.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.418
...so once a president
is elected,

34:46.452 --> 34:48.587
the Board can deal with this

34:48.620 --> 34:51.590
very serious matter
as soon as possible.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.192
[murmuring]

35:08.707 --> 35:11.243
I'm sorry we don't
serve champagne,

35:11.277 --> 35:14.380
Mr. Rock Star
With A Record Deal. [chuckles]

35:14.413 --> 35:18.717
Just don't forget us little
people still slingin' pizzas
for a living, huh?

35:18.750 --> 35:22.454
You look like you're
having fun. You and Emily.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.657
Don't forget,
I worked with her first.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.759
So, what's going on with her?

35:27.793 --> 35:30.862
I thought that she'd
be happy to see me.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.598
But I feel like there is
something she's not telling me.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.267
Maybe you should
of stuck to the rules.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.369
Paris in 2012, right?

35:37.403 --> 35:39.705
Until then, you guys
can do your own thing.

35:39.738 --> 35:43.675
The point was for her to take
the next two years to focus
on getting to the Olympics.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.645
While your fans are throwing
themselves at you
night after night?

35:47.713 --> 35:49.715
Maybe she needs
to have a little fun, too.

35:53.352 --> 35:54.720
Did you ever think
that she might need that,

35:54.753 --> 35:58.357
with all the pressure
that she's under?

35:58.390 --> 36:00.592
I got a delivery to make.

36:10.836 --> 36:11.937
[door opens]

36:14.706 --> 36:18.410
- Did you win?
- Steve won.

36:18.444 --> 36:19.911
No way.
How is that possible?

36:19.945 --> 36:24.483
Sweetheart, there's
something you need to know.

36:25.751 --> 36:29.154
Ellen Beals showed up at
the Board elections tonight.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.824
And I have no idea
how she got this,

36:32.858 --> 36:35.794
but she has a picture
of you kissing Sasha.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.167
The... The training cam.
It was recording.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.802
Now, everybody's gonna
know what I did.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.772
Not everyone.
It was just an innocent kiss.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.840
Oh, my God.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.811
I want to die.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.947
I know.

36:55.981 --> 36:58.917
[Steve] I mean,
I'm sure I would have won,

36:58.950 --> 37:00.786
even if Ellen Beals
hadn't shown up.

37:00.819 --> 37:05.257
But that picture...
[laughs] made it a landslide.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.426
Summer must've
totally flipped out.

37:07.459 --> 37:08.827
I bet she breaks up with Sasha.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.630
Now that she sees
what kind of man he really is.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.699
Things do not
look good for Sasha.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.701
And as the new president
of the Rock Board,

37:15.734 --> 37:18.404
I can assure you
his days are numbered.

37:18.437 --> 37:22.207
[laughs] Well,
the best man won in the end.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.276
Hey, we both won.

37:24.310 --> 37:27.713
And now that we have
control of The Rock back,
nothing can stop us.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.515
[laughs]

37:29.548 --> 37:31.783
It's been a long time
since we've had a
father-daughter dinner.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.219
Let's go to Le Privilege
to celebrate.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.723
I know exactly
what I'm going to wear.
Team Tanner is back!

37:37.756 --> 37:39.991
[phone rings]

37:44.830 --> 37:46.932
Steve Tanner.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.568
Uh, Leslie Tanner
is my ex-wife.
We're divorced.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.337
What's this about?

37:59.678 --> 38:01.347
[door opens]

38:24.803 --> 38:27.739
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.980
I'm really sorry
about last night.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.816
No, I'm sorry.

38:37.849 --> 38:43.622
We said goodbye in France,
until 2012...

38:43.655 --> 38:47.793
...if we still feel
the same about each other.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.362
I am really happy to see you.

38:50.396 --> 38:52.364
[* Cary Brothers: Alien]

38:52.398 --> 38:56.368
- It's just...
- You're doing your own thing,
like we said.

38:56.402 --> 39:01.473
- I feel so bad.
- You don't have to feel bad.

39:01.507 --> 39:06.311
Hey, I promised to give you
space to pursue your dream.

39:06.344 --> 39:10.749
And... I don't
want you to be lonely

39:10.782 --> 39:14.520
in the meantime.

39:14.553 --> 39:17.389
I mean, if you
want to be with...

39:17.423 --> 39:20.058
What I'm trying to say

39:20.091 --> 39:23.028
is you're free.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.362
And I'm free.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.799
And after seeing
you here with Razor today,

39:27.833 --> 39:31.069
I get why you've
been acting weird.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.673
OK, but I, you know...

39:34.706 --> 39:36.007
I get it.

39:36.041 --> 39:39.711
It's cool.
I'm cool.

39:39.745 --> 39:43.048
And you're right. I should be
in LA focusing on my album,

39:43.081 --> 39:45.551
and not getting
sidetracked in Boulder.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.753
This is the time
to do my thing.

39:47.786 --> 39:52.591
And I can't...
be distracted with love.

39:55.627 --> 39:59.364
So I just wanted to tell you
that I'm leaving tonight.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.133
And thank you
for the wakeup call. I...

40:03.969 --> 40:05.537
I needed it.

Your mother
was in an accident.

41:19.545 --> 41:22.948
- What? Was she high?
- No.

41:22.981 --> 41:26.017
The authorities said it
wasn't her fault. She...

41:28.053 --> 41:30.789
There's no
easy way to say this.

41:31.657 --> 41:33.091
She's dead, Lauren.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.895
I'm so sorry, baby.

41:39.898 --> 41:44.169
Lauren, do you understand
what I just told you?

41:45.170 --> 41:47.806
I understand perfectly.

41:49.975 --> 41:53.779
And honestly,
I feel nothing.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.523
I won't let Ellen Beals
destroy Payson's career.

42:38.556 --> 42:43.862
[sighs] I can't believe
even she could sink so low.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.632
Payson is gonna be devastated.

42:46.665 --> 42:49.067
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

42:49.100 --> 42:52.871
I wanted to protect
her privacy.

42:53.972 --> 42:56.041
Now, the whole world knows.

42:56.074 --> 42:59.144
The facts will
win out in the end.

42:59.177 --> 43:01.880
No one will ever believe
that you did anything wrong.

43:01.913 --> 43:06.284
- You're an honorable man.
- And Payson?

43:07.853 --> 43:10.055
Payson is strong.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.290
* We have become

43:13.591 --> 43:16.561
- * Alien *
- You're right.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.730
You're right.
Payson is strong.
