WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:09.298
(theme music playing )

00:36.329 --> 00:38.661
Guard: Mind them.

00:51.761 --> 00:54.878
( fanfare )

01:06.150 --> 01:08.015
The noble House of Batiatus

01:08.194 --> 01:10.981
stands humbled--

01:11.155 --> 01:13.817
humbled by the blessings
the gods have seen fit

01:13.991 --> 01:16.824
to shower upon us...

01:18.829 --> 01:20.660
and by the presence

01:20.831 --> 01:23.117
of the most revered citizens
in all of Capua,

01:23.292 --> 01:25.874
come to join in celebrating
the patronage

01:26.045 --> 01:29.037
of Legatus Claudius Glaber.

01:29.215 --> 01:30.751
The man himself regrets

01:30.925 --> 01:32.790
the duties of the senate
prevent his attendance,

01:32.969 --> 01:35.301
but he would see us
properly addressed,

01:35.471 --> 01:38.463
his words delivered
by pleasing tongue of trusted wife.

01:42.228 --> 01:45.470
Good citizens
of Rome's favored sister,

01:45.648 --> 01:49.061
it is with great pleasure
that l, Legatus Claudius Glaber,

01:49.235 --> 01:52.944
bestow upon
Quintus Lentulus Batiatus

01:53.114 --> 01:56.527
my patronage
and all encompassing benefits.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.908
No man in all of Capua
is more deserving

01:59.078 --> 02:00.784
of such esteemed privilege.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.820
Good Batiatus
should be held as example

02:02.999 --> 02:05.957
to a city mired in shadows
and treachery,

02:06.127 --> 02:07.867
the guiding light
of his virtuous heart

02:08.045 --> 02:11.458
providing illumination in these
dark and troubling times.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.419
For this reason
and too many others to give voice...

02:14.593 --> 02:16.458
( whispers )
Still yourself.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.923
...| lend my full
and unconditional support

02:19.098 --> 02:22.010
to the honored position
ofaedHe.

02:22.184 --> 02:25.768
Aemilia failed to mention
you had mind towards office.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.678
Oh, I admit to none,
good Sextus,

02:27.857 --> 02:30.314
until the legatus
broached the subject.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.480
Aedile is but a breath
below magistrate.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.110
Hmm.

02:35.281 --> 02:38.148
We should dine
and discuss the matter further.

02:40.119 --> 02:43.828
My heart to Legatus Glaber
and his support.

02:43.998 --> 02:47.081
In the hopes that you will share it
in the coming days,

02:47.251 --> 02:50.038
I present a gift of blood--

02:50.212 --> 02:52.544
two legends of the arena

02:52.715 --> 02:55.081
to face each other
sine missione--

02:55.259 --> 02:57.966
no quarter given,
no mercy shown.

02:58.137 --> 03:01.550
Behold Crixus,

03:01.724 --> 03:03.931
the savage Gaul.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.057
( applause )

03:09.023 --> 03:11.389
And who shall attempt
to tame him?

03:11.567 --> 03:14.479
There can be
but one man--

03:14.653 --> 03:16.644
Spartacus,

03:16.822 --> 03:19.154
slayer of the Shadow of Death.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.452
He is of a form, is he not?

03:30.503 --> 03:31.993
He stands a god.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.087
Crixus.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.873
l have given my answer.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.963
Let us finish this.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.353
Begin!

04:04.995 --> 04:07.202
(yelling)

04:26.976 --> 04:29.092
You speak
of dangerous things.

04:35.151 --> 04:37.563
We live in dangerous times.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.907
Many yet hold Crixus
our true champion.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.578
Count me among them.

04:52.042 --> 04:55.284
Doctore, I would work
the palus.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.125
Permission for Spartacus.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.850
Have you traded words
with Hamilcar?

05:12.021 --> 05:13.682
He is with us.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.894
But Lisus
and the other Gauls

05:18.068 --> 05:21.356
refuse to grab cock
without Crixus holding their balls.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.737
Where does Rhaskos stand?

05:23.908 --> 05:25.739
The same.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.117
Our numbers
are yet shallow.

05:29.288 --> 05:32.371
We must gain Crixus's support
and see them rise.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.749
The fucking madman's
still under lock and key.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.878
How will you turn him to cause
if you cannot break words with him?

05:39.048 --> 05:41.334
Being champion
yet affords privilege.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.295
A way shall present itself.

05:43.469 --> 05:46.302
- Guard: Answer.
- lt best present fucking soon.

05:46.472 --> 05:48.463
Did he tell you to stand?

05:51.227 --> 05:53.468
(man grunting)

05:53.646 --> 05:56.638
Glaber falls to patronage

05:56.815 --> 05:59.147
and the men of influence
greet me as a fucking brother.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.309
A day of shining glory

06:01.487 --> 06:04.820
marred by darkening cloud.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.981
I beg a word, Dominus,

06:07.159 --> 06:08.820
in private.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.953
Doctore,

06:13.123 --> 06:16.832
well, spill sour thoughts
and hear them sweetened.

06:17.002 --> 06:20.210
Glaber's mercenaries punish
absentcause.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.042
The men suffer
at their hand.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.922
It is a burden
that must be endured.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.334
l have no time
for such petty concerns.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.173
With respect,

06:28.347 --> 06:30.963
every ludus requires
the attention of its lanista.

06:31.141 --> 06:34.633
I seek a loftier title,
one far removed from the arena.

06:34.812 --> 06:37.849
You would see your family's heritage
a thing of memory?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.684
No.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.440
Yet | tire of the dust
and drudgery

06:42.611 --> 06:45.353
and lwould have my interests
in blood and sand

06:45.531 --> 06:49.149
overseen by someone
with more attentive eyes,

06:49.326 --> 06:51.817
someone who has forever
proven loyal.

06:53.706 --> 06:56.038
You would entrust the ludus
to a slave?

06:56.208 --> 06:58.995
A slave-- never.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.541
I had thought
to make announcement

07:02.715 --> 07:06.082
at the celebration,
but you force my hand.

07:06.260 --> 07:09.343
My advocate is drawing up papers
granting your freedom.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.014
Freedom?

07:11.181 --> 07:12.637
No longer shall you be
my doctore.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.719
You will assume the mantle
of lanista

07:14.893 --> 07:19.136
and be warmly greeted
by your name-- Oenomaus.

07:19.315 --> 07:22.148
I had thought
the news to please.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.650
Apologies.

07:24.820 --> 07:28.733
l have heard rumor--
one that has vexed sleep.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.193
Well, give voice,
and dream again.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.361
Barca was not
granted freedom.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.905
Instead he met his end
at your hands.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.880
The rumor is true,

07:55.059 --> 07:57.175
yet absent reasoning.

07:57.353 --> 08:01.437
Barca was dispatched to deliver
a simple message to Ovidius.

08:01.607 --> 08:04.223
Instead he slaughtered the man
and his entire fucking family

08:04.401 --> 08:07.438
against command.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.899
I had no choice but to take his life
before the magistrate

08:10.074 --> 08:12.110
discovered the deed
and pulled us all to ruin.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.899
And Ashur--

08:14.078 --> 08:17.161
did he aid in this choice?

08:20.876 --> 08:23.583
When you are lanista,
you shall also be faced

08:23.754 --> 08:25.460
with decisions
grave of consequence

08:25.631 --> 08:29.465
and know your measure
by how your blade falls.

08:31.595 --> 08:31.629
(men grunting)

08:31.637 --> 08:34.299
(men grunting)

08:37.768 --> 08:39.304
Can you yet
feel him move,

08:39.478 --> 08:41.139
eager to make entrance
into the world?

08:41.313 --> 08:43.349
How do you divine a boy?

08:43.524 --> 08:46.140
Because the gods
fucking favor us.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.651
Glaber's patronage,
access to the upper strata of Capua,

08:49.822 --> 08:51.312
the promise
of political office--

08:51.490 --> 08:55.028
everything we have bled for
finally within our grasp.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.490
We are truly blessed.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.325
( chuckles )

09:00.499 --> 09:02.330
l deliver but glorious news
this day,

09:02.501 --> 09:04.708
to be met
with tempered response.

09:04.878 --> 09:09.212
Joy is restrained to lend
clear mind to celebration.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.466
Glaber's patronage may have
paved road to the elite,

09:12.636 --> 09:14.172
but they are
of ravenous appetite.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.337
And what meal would you suggest
to see them sated?

09:16.515 --> 09:19.848
One that only
the House of Batiatus can prepare--

09:20.018 --> 09:23.181
Spartacus,
the slayer of Theokoles,

09:23.355 --> 09:25.141
in a contest to the death.

09:26.984 --> 09:30.647
We have already presented such
diversion at Numerius's toga virilis.

09:30.821 --> 09:33.813
Varro was no match
for the champion of Capua.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.323
We must give them
what was denied that night,

09:36.493 --> 09:38.654
what all of Capua
longs to see

09:38.829 --> 09:41.696
but only a privileged few under our roof
may bear witness to--

09:41.874 --> 09:45.537
the champion of Capua,
Spartacus,

09:45.711 --> 09:47.872
in a fight for his life
against the only man

09:48.046 --> 09:50.332
who has ever
defeated him.

09:51.383 --> 09:54.295
Is this your fucking hope--
that the fallen Gaul

09:54.470 --> 09:57.052
is granted opportunity
to regain position?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.087
Out.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.095
You mistake intent.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.886
I would see Crixus dead

10:06.064 --> 10:08.396
for offenses committed
against the House of Batiatus.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.728
Then we stand as one
in such regard.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.895
Oh, your tongue named
cause of doubt.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.781
Crixus is the only gladiator
to pose threat to Spartacus.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.237
And there is yet
political advantage

10:20.412 --> 10:24.280
to parading the bringer of rain
as l campaign for office.

10:25.334 --> 10:29.577
Then we must ensure
Spartacus victorious.

10:29.755 --> 10:33.088
And Crixus
fades from memory.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.600
That will be all.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.267
Patronage comes
with unfortunate attachments.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.104
A fact I am well aware of.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.820
I am reminded of the first time
you stood before me in this office,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.982
a savage in chains.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.617
Now you stand
as death made meat and bone.

11:02.788 --> 11:05.996
It was your hand
that forged my purpose.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.282
Yet it is upon your shoulders
the House of Batiatus

11:08.460 --> 11:12.624
has been so elevated
and continues to rise.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.164
Two days hence
we play host

11:15.342 --> 11:17.424
to the most influential
in Capua,

11:17.594 --> 11:19.585
in celebration
of patronage.

11:19.763 --> 11:22.470
Although a closer look
at the slayer of Theokoles

11:22.641 --> 11:24.506
be the true draw.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.597
A great honor. Will the men be
displayed in the villa?

11:27.771 --> 11:30.934
The legatus would frown
upon such storied tradition.

11:31.108 --> 11:34.100
You and the others
will be confined to the square.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.234
And how will our guests
have view?

11:36.405 --> 11:38.111
From purchase
of the balcony.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.773
No eye will be denied
the champion of Capua

11:40.951 --> 11:43.988
as he faces his archenemy
in a match to the death.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.284
I'm to fight Crixus?

11:48.458 --> 11:49.994
This concerns you?

11:50.168 --> 11:53.501
It is long overdue.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.084
Yet there is no honor

11:56.258 --> 11:58.749
in taking the life
of a caged lion.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.667
I would see him return
to training,

12:00.846 --> 12:04.009
so he may better thrill the crowd
before his end.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.720
( guffaws ) You truly have
fucking mind for this.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.811
Crixus shall be freed from bond,
yet only for training.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.223
I would not have
the animal run free,

12:14.401 --> 12:16.141
lest he again bares teeth.

12:16.320 --> 12:20.063
Remove yourself to slumber
and dreams of extracting them.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.778
Apologies, Dominus.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.443
There is something

12:26.622 --> 12:29.034
I crave more than sleep.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.340
You ask the impossible.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.300
The gates to the villa
must stand open

12:46.475 --> 12:47.885
before I make a move
on Batiatus.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.392
You would have me risk all.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.387
And for what?

12:54.441 --> 12:56.557
So that Spartacus
may have his revenge?

12:56.735 --> 12:59.351
No.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.612
So that his heart might find
a measure of peace.

13:06.703 --> 13:10.070
Was she such a woman--

13:10.248 --> 13:11.658
your wife?

13:13.126 --> 13:16.618
She was the sun,

13:16.797 --> 13:18.753
never to rise again.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.416
A heavy thing--

13:22.594 --> 13:26.257
to be denied its warmth.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.218
I will see the gate opened.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.844
But I would have exchange.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.104
This is my price--

13:36.274 --> 13:40.267
to feel you inside me,

13:40.445 --> 13:42.652
to know a pale shadow

13:42.823 --> 13:44.859
of the love
that you felt for her.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.035
(yelling)

14:51.016 --> 14:53.553
I would not have wagered the Gaul
such a challenge to Spartacus.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.638
You underestimate
the man, Aemilia.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.679
Crixus was once champion,
was he not?

14:58.857 --> 15:00.973
The match is
but newly born.

15:02.027 --> 15:05.360
Much may yet happen
as it matures.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.361
Apologies, Domina.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.944
I must gather more wine
from the stores.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.619
Send another.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.994
lwould keep you close
to attend the guests.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.047
You must listen to me.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.653
Dominus has ordered
my release?

15:48.824 --> 15:50.906
It was Spartacus
that moved his hand.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.862
Spartacus?

15:53.036 --> 15:55.402
He desires you
at your best

15:55.580 --> 15:59.573
when you stand before him
sine missione.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.413
The gods finally answer
my prayers.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.203
Had they
but answered sooner.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.373
You stand before him
tomorrow

16:07.551 --> 16:09.416
as the sun fades.

16:09.594 --> 16:13.337
If it were this very moment,
the outcome would not change.

16:13.515 --> 16:16.427
l have made promise
to Naevia.

16:21.606 --> 16:24.894
lwill not die until I have gained
my freedom

16:25.068 --> 16:26.433
and she is
in my arms again.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.351
Delay talk of freedom

16:28.530 --> 16:31.067
until there are ears
that would welcome the sound.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.946
I fear Dominus
shall forever be deaf to it.

16:35.954 --> 16:40.664
Place your faith
to closer quarters.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.496
Dominus releases me
from the bonds of servitude

16:43.670 --> 16:46.412
to assume mantle
as lanista.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.551
It is a title well deserved.

16:53.722 --> 16:57.385
Together we will restore honor
to this ludus

16:57.559 --> 16:59.049
and Naevia to your arms.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.139
Spartacus but stands
in your way.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.976
Then he shall fall.

17:11.907 --> 17:14.819
- A celebration?
- Filled with the elite.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.949
Their deaths will shatter Capua
to chaos.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.032
It'll be days before they
regain senses to pursue us.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.664
- Our plan takes form.
- What of Crixus?

17:22.834 --> 17:25.450
You still must find way to broach
subject with the fucking Gaul.

17:25.629 --> 17:28.666
It presents itself,
as promised.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.674
Men: Yeah, Crixus!
Crixus!

17:32.844 --> 17:36.837
Crixus! Yeah!

17:37.015 --> 17:39.301
Crixus!

17:39.476 --> 17:41.967
Fuck my ass.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.056
Now all that remains
is convincing

17:44.231 --> 17:46.768
a man that hates you
to join your cause.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.860
Lucretia: Have you seen
task to completion?

17:53.031 --> 17:55.488
My husband's patronage
has lifted your celebration

17:55.659 --> 17:57.320
beyond the heavens,

17:57.494 --> 17:59.655
clouds bursting
with honored guests.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.320
Altius and his cousin Gaius?
They are a necessity.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.115
And are delivered,
as commanded.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.459
Aemilia's husband Sextus?

18:08.630 --> 18:11.212
He's a former magistrate,
yet beloved by many.

18:11.383 --> 18:14.045
His support would
all but secure office.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.211
Pressing affairs
draw him to Rome.

18:17.389 --> 18:20.051
That does not bring
comfort, llithyia.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.050
Then perhaps
his attendance shall.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.389
He will delay travel

18:25.563 --> 18:27.895
with mind towards
your celebration.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.727
How did you turn
his attentions?

18:29.901 --> 18:31.892
He favors me.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.606
Most husbands do.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.364
( laughs)

18:37.534 --> 18:40.901
Well, your services have been

18:41.079 --> 18:42.990
deeply appreciated.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.870
Yet more is needed.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.702
In the absence of your
honored husband,

18:46.876 --> 18:50.084
we would have you address
our most noble guests--

18:50.255 --> 18:53.998
just a few words
as if fallen from his mouth,

18:54.175 --> 18:57.463
extolling the virtues
of the House of Batiatus.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.928
I shall compose something
appropriate for the occasion.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.590
No need.
I've already seen to it.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.847
My hands are
no longer my own,

19:11.026 --> 19:13.608
and now you seize
my fucking tongue?

19:13.778 --> 19:17.691
I would not have it flap about
absent direction.

19:17.866 --> 19:20.027
How much longer must I suffer
your indignities?

19:20.201 --> 19:24.035
While breath gives life
to my command.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.451
As you wish then.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.956
I know there have been
tensions between us,

19:36.134 --> 19:39.968
yet I see no cause
for our current arrangement

19:40.138 --> 19:42.925
to fall into
unpleasantness.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.637
We were
such dear friends once.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.427
Would you not
see it so again?

19:50.940 --> 19:53.647
Would that I had power
to reverse the sun

19:53.818 --> 19:56.560
and restore the world
to its proper place.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.383
Rest. Eat.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.265
We resume
after midday sun has passed.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.370
You move well,

20:49.541 --> 20:51.372
as if lash
had never struck.

20:51.543 --> 20:54.956
Pain is erased
when inflicted upon others.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.121
I would have you at your best
when we face each other.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.549
Is that all
you'd have from me?

20:58.716 --> 21:01.628
Rhaskos speaks
of your desires.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.135
What fever grips brain
that Spartacus would think me

21:04.305 --> 21:07.138
to band with him,
to risk the lives of my men,

21:07.308 --> 21:08.844
my life?

21:09.018 --> 21:10.394
Is there one,

21:10.562 --> 21:12.974
without the woman you love
within it?

21:15.483 --> 21:17.064
I've never had
stronger reason to live.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.521
I know your heart, Crixus.

21:19.696 --> 21:23.405
I felt the beating of it
within my chest once.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.736
Then you know
I'll fucking survive

21:25.910 --> 21:27.411
and see Naevia
returned to me.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.742
As my wife
was returned?

21:30.915 --> 21:34.157
( quietly ) Batiatus ordered
her death.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.875
How did you come
upon this?

21:40.049 --> 21:42.005
Bytongue
of his man Aulus,

21:42.177 --> 21:44.884
before silencing it
forever.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.796
I will see
the House of Batiatus fall,

21:47.974 --> 21:49.930
and with it the villain's blood
upon the earth.

21:50.101 --> 21:53.013
As would I
in your position.

21:53.188 --> 21:56.726
But I am far removed.
My escape would not aid Naevia.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.391
How would I purchase
her freedom or even find her

21:59.569 --> 22:01.525
while being hunted
like a dog by the Romans?

22:01.696 --> 22:03.607
Join me

22:03.781 --> 22:07.444
and we will find her
together.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.617
You know
that in another life

22:13.791 --> 22:15.782
you and I may have been
as brothers.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.787
But not in this one.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.965
I must win my freedom
in the arena.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.468
Then we stand in the way
of each other's cause.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.595
And both are just.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.057
But if I fall,

22:34.229 --> 22:36.515
I'd have you swear
to find Naevia

22:36.689 --> 22:38.645
and see her freed.

22:38.816 --> 22:42.559
And I would have word
that if you are victorious,

22:42.737 --> 22:46.150
one day you will have
Batiatus's life.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.241
Tomorrow then

22:54.415 --> 22:56.827
one of us dies.

22:57.001 --> 23:00.334
I fear it was always
fated so.

23:13.101 --> 23:14.307
Dominus.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.729
Were you able to procure
what we need for tomorrow?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.185
Ashur: Good Marcellus
was ever helpful.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.317
Leave us.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.655
Varro possessed
a fine eye.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.862
Turn yours
towards business.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.901
What has coin extracted
from Marcellus?

23:34.080 --> 23:37.038
A solution to a most
vexing problem.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.915
A few drops in his cup,
and fate is sealed.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.169
It must not kill him. Our guests need
to believe the match balanced,

23:43.339 --> 23:44.875
lest good will
turn to accusation.

23:45.049 --> 23:48.507
It will but weaken Crixus,
allowing Spartacus advantage.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.589
Hmm.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.800
It is a marvel

23:53.975 --> 23:56.557
that something so slight
could topple a legend.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.593
All men fall.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.308
It is but time and method
that differ.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.232
See it done,

24:05.403 --> 24:08.566
and in the act--
the end of that fucking Gaul.

24:12.869 --> 24:15.406
(Crixus yelling )

24:24.047 --> 24:26.459
Crixus moves
with deadly purpose.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.589
He gives much better showing
against Spartacus

24:28.760 --> 24:30.216
than the fool Varro.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.887
llithyia: Poor Varro.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.262
He never stood
proper chance, did he?

24:38.102 --> 24:40.593
Crixus, however, threatens to strip
the champion

24:40.772 --> 24:43.104
of life and title.

24:43.274 --> 24:44.480
lndeed.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.767
The Gaul yet surprises.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.684
To the very end.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.747
(jug crashes)

25:08.925 --> 25:10.415
Apologies.

25:38.287 --> 25:43.327
Batiatus: Esteemed and
special friends,

25:43.501 --> 25:45.867
the noble House of Batiatus

25:46.045 --> 25:48.331
stands humbled--

25:48.506 --> 25:50.337
humbled by the fortunes

25:50.508 --> 25:52.214
the gods have seen fit
to shower upon us.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.171
I should use
"blessings" instead.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.836
"Fortune" has
but connotation of coin.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.300
Blessings then.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.927
Oh, Quintus,

26:04.105 --> 26:07.939
has this city
yet beheld such a man?

26:08.109 --> 26:10.316
Your father
would be so proud.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.863
The old bastard would have
cracked with jealousy,

26:13.030 --> 26:14.611
to be so eclipsed
by unworthy son.

26:14.782 --> 26:17.194
He loved you, Quintus.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.359
Yet he never
believed in me.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.903
Would that he were alive
to see the House of Batiatus

26:22.081 --> 26:25.244
soaring beneath the flapping
of my wings.

26:25.418 --> 26:28.251
Our son shall inherit
a fucking empire.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.831
An empire now, is it?

26:30.006 --> 26:31.712
The foundation's
already laid.

26:31.883 --> 26:33.544
Today we build upon it.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.879
Spartacus and Crixus,
hated foes,

26:36.053 --> 26:38.214
facing each other in death.

26:38.389 --> 26:39.595
( chuckles )

26:39.766 --> 26:41.552
The whole of the republic
will whisper with envy

26:41.726 --> 26:44.718
what so privileged few
bore witness.

26:44.896 --> 26:48.184
It will be a thing
not soon forgotten.

26:50.234 --> 26:53.101
I fear your resolve
grows soft.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.440
Stone.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.530
l but wish an end
to the matter

26:58.701 --> 27:00.566
and to the man himself.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.736
Ashur already attends to it.

27:02.914 --> 27:05.121
Turn thoughts
from unfortunate past

27:05.291 --> 27:07.782
and fix
on glorious future.

27:24.310 --> 27:28.144
These celebrations
can cause hands to tremble,

27:28.314 --> 27:30.726
even most practiced ones.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.106
Gratitude.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.267
See nerves calmed.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.231
You'll do well here.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.612
l have a feeling of it.

27:38.783 --> 27:41.650
You are allowed to eat
from your master's table?

27:41.828 --> 27:45.286
I prepare this as a tribute
to the mighty Crixus

27:45.456 --> 27:47.037
before his match
against the champion.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.073
May the gods
bless it then

27:49.252 --> 27:50.958
and give him strength
to kill Spartacus.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.165
I would save prayer.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.087
I do not believe
Spartacus will fall this day.

28:00.763 --> 28:03.800
l have heard Crixus
bested him once in the arena

28:03.975 --> 28:05.840
at the vulcanalia.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.725
What leads you to certainty
against similar outcome?

28:08.896 --> 28:12.980
I'm certain of many things
within these walls,

28:13.150 --> 28:16.062
your beauty among them.

28:16.237 --> 28:19.320
Aurelia, you are needed
in the square.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.693
Agron: Stay to my side.

28:59.864 --> 29:02.230
Do not stray from it, and I will see you
beyond these walls.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.114
I do not need you
to hold hand.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.571
Agron: | only wish your life protected,
you fucking cock.

29:06.746 --> 29:09.738
Speak louder
and see us all undone.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.875
I would have
his fucking whip removed,

29:14.045 --> 29:15.581
along with the arm
that wields it.

29:15.755 --> 29:18.212
Doctore is
an honorable man.

29:18.382 --> 29:22.341
I would not have him dead,
nor any slave.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.173
You fret of shit and piss.
Rhaskos and the others

29:25.348 --> 29:27.213
still will not fall to purpose
without Crixus.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.803
They will seize
the moment.

29:30.853 --> 29:34.220
Crixus is dead, and there stands
but one champion.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.735
Doctore.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.740
Water.

30:05.346 --> 30:08.429
These celebrations have habit
of turning from control.

30:08.599 --> 30:10.635
Should they again,

30:10.810 --> 30:12.801
remove to a safe place.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.140
None exist,

30:15.314 --> 30:18.181
not since Varro was taken
from me by your hand.

30:18.359 --> 30:21.396
And I shall forever despise it
for the deed,

30:21.570 --> 30:23.526
in company with the voice
that commanded it.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.108
You blame Batiatus?

30:25.282 --> 30:28.524
For many things,
but not this.

30:30.287 --> 30:32.278
It was the boy Numerius

30:32.456 --> 30:36.119
who demanded
simple sport end in death.

30:38.212 --> 30:42.296
And I should believe a man
that would do anything to win?

30:48.222 --> 30:50.383
Do not take me a fool.

30:50.558 --> 30:52.799
Ashur prepares meal
for Crixus

30:52.977 --> 30:55.059
and speaks of the certainty
of your fucking victory.

30:55.229 --> 30:57.060
They corrupt his food?

30:57.231 --> 30:59.813
Was it the same
for Varro?

30:59.984 --> 31:02.646
Is that
how you bested him?

31:05.197 --> 31:07.529
l have no hand in this.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.986
Were that true,

31:10.161 --> 31:12.527
I would still pray

31:12.705 --> 31:15.367
Crixus takes your life
before he falls.

31:35.186 --> 31:37.347
Lucretia:
You betrayed me.

31:39.106 --> 31:41.062
Yet I've come to see

31:41.233 --> 31:44.270
that the fault
is not your own.

31:44.445 --> 31:48.108
You cannot be blamed
for being weak.

31:48.282 --> 31:52.070
All men are, when faced
with wet opportunity.

31:53.162 --> 31:55.699
lwould put it behind us.

31:57.041 --> 32:00.124
All | ask in return is the truth.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.708
Tell me Naevia

32:05.883 --> 32:08.420
held no meaning for you.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.762
You ask me to speak
with false tongue.

32:14.642 --> 32:16.553
What would it conjure
for our child?

32:16.727 --> 32:18.263
Child?

32:18.437 --> 32:22.476
Seed has at last taken hold.

32:22.650 --> 32:24.732
The gods bless us.

32:24.902 --> 32:28.394
And you would divine me
as father,

32:28.572 --> 32:31.234
not Dominus?

32:31.408 --> 32:35.276
| feel the blood of a champion
swelling inside me.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.241
| feel you, Crixus.

32:39.708 --> 32:43.200
l have often dreamt
in quiet moments

32:43.379 --> 32:46.746
of having a child

32:46.924 --> 32:50.087
with Naevia.

32:51.887 --> 32:55.425
So there is nothing left
between us?

33:05.276 --> 33:07.107
Crixus...

33:09.113 --> 33:12.571
I didn't intend for it
to end this way.

33:36.307 --> 33:37.797
( cheers, applause)

33:37.975 --> 33:40.011
- Man: Kill that Gaul!
- Crixus begins to fade.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.643
As all memories do.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.941
Man:
I want to see him bleed!

33:50.112 --> 33:52.649
You're weakened because
they have poisoned you.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.154
Woman: Finish him!

33:54.325 --> 33:56.111
They wish you dead.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.322
Man: More blood!

34:10.466 --> 34:11.797
Man: Stuff that pig!

34:11.967 --> 34:13.673
I would not have this.

34:21.352 --> 34:24.264
Join me, brother,

34:24.438 --> 34:26.645
and we shall see
the House of Batiatus fall.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.851
Man: Slice him in two!

34:30.486 --> 34:32.693
Man #2: Kill the dog!

34:40.871 --> 34:43.248
( applause )

34:53.175 --> 34:55.882
Spartacus...

35:00.849 --> 35:02.555
(yelling)

35:06.730 --> 35:08.391
( guests screaming )

35:11.026 --> 35:12.527
Sextus!

35:38.095 --> 35:40.461
Kill them!
Kill them all!

35:40.639 --> 35:42.595
(yelling)

35:42.766 --> 35:45.633
Guard: Seize them!
Attack!

35:45.811 --> 35:47.767
Man: Batiatus, what is this?

35:47.938 --> 35:51.601
Do not be alarmed, people.
Everything is under control.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.481
Please.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.563
He tried to kill you,
that fucking animal.

35:55.738 --> 35:58.696
We must calm this.
Where are the fucking guards?

36:00.409 --> 36:02.821
Why do you stand there?
Gather your men.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.747
I shall see you
properly attended.

36:23.474 --> 36:25.465
(screaming )

36:39.782 --> 36:41.613
Hamilcar!

36:54.171 --> 36:56.833
Crixus!

36:59.176 --> 37:01.918
- What is this madness?
- Spartacus shows us the way.

37:02.096 --> 37:04.087
He is a dog without honor.

37:04.264 --> 37:06.004
This house
is without honor.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.515
Batiatus ordered
his wife dead.

37:08.685 --> 37:11.347
And Domina--
she has tainted me

37:11.522 --> 37:13.638
because I spurn
her fucking heart.

37:13.816 --> 37:16.353
l have given my life
to this ludus.

37:16.527 --> 37:19.860
No, they stole it from you,
from all of us.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.112
You asked me
to put faith in you.

37:22.282 --> 37:24.989
| ask the same.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.866
Honor us all

37:27.037 --> 37:28.902
and see an end
of this fucking house.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.872
(yells)

37:39.174 --> 37:40.380
Go!

38:14.835 --> 38:16.291
(laughing)

38:16.462 --> 38:18.418
- ( guard
yellin
- No! Q)

38:36.064 --> 38:39.522
| save you this time,
brother.

39:06.595 --> 39:10.213
(screaming )

39:10.390 --> 39:13.473
Friends, we are perfectly safe
inside the villa.

39:13.644 --> 39:16.636
The situation is being attended.
Still your hearts.

39:16.813 --> 39:20.146
This very moment my guards are
no doubt dealing with these--

39:20.317 --> 39:22.353
- ( men shouting )
- They've lost mind.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.860
( guests screaming )

39:51.098 --> 39:53.339
Where the fuck is llithyia?

39:54.351 --> 39:56.433
Come. Let us away.

39:58.313 --> 40:01.055
Seal the doors.
Let no one beyond them.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.439
What of the guests?

40:02.609 --> 40:04.190
I am the wife
of the legatus.

40:04.361 --> 40:06.192
Seal the fucking doors.

40:13.537 --> 40:15.869
llithyia!

40:24.548 --> 40:26.254
Man: Open the doors!

40:46.403 --> 40:48.394
Do you recall what I said

40:48.572 --> 40:50.563
in this very room--

40:50.741 --> 40:53.483
that if there was more
to Barca's departure,

40:53.660 --> 40:56.993
you and I
would share words?

41:00.542 --> 41:01.782
Doctore.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.997
Do not fucking speak.

41:05.172 --> 41:07.333
l have seen you ply
tongue upon ear,

41:07.507 --> 41:08.917
whispering poison,

41:09.092 --> 41:11.504
infecting the honor
of this house.

41:11.678 --> 41:14.420
You would kill
a defenseless man?

41:14.598 --> 41:16.714
Where is the fucking honor
in that?

41:16.892 --> 41:18.757
Let's see if you recall
what I taught you

41:18.935 --> 41:21.221
when you were
yet a man.

41:27.152 --> 41:31.441
The doors. The doors.

41:31.615 --> 41:34.231
Glaber's men
sealed the doors.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.785
llithyia.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.453
Why would she do
such a thing?

41:37.621 --> 41:39.327
Mother!

41:50.926 --> 41:52.257
Quintus.

41:52.427 --> 41:55.169
Go. Go!

41:55.347 --> 41:57.429
Come.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.179
Man: Come here,
you Roman pussies.

42:02.354 --> 42:04.060
(women screaming )

42:04.231 --> 42:07.098
- Numerius: We are all of us dead.
- No, we will regain this house.

42:09.069 --> 42:11.185
Take Numerius.
Conceal yourselves.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.069
Come. I know a place.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.322
Where do you go?

42:15.492 --> 42:17.483
To my husband...

42:19.830 --> 42:21.616
and the death
of Spartacus.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.046
Pathetic.

42:31.216 --> 42:35.209
You think this will
cause difference?

42:36.513 --> 42:38.925
Even if life fades,

42:39.099 --> 42:41.966
my hand shall yet be felt.

42:42.144 --> 42:45.181
lt plotted
the death of Barca,

42:45.355 --> 42:47.687
saw the magistrate's end.

42:47.858 --> 42:50.770
It even helped force
Glaber to patronage.

42:50.944 --> 42:53.060
Every beam,

42:53.238 --> 42:56.321
every stone
in this fucking house

42:56.491 --> 42:59.153
bears the mark
of Ashur.

42:59.327 --> 43:02.660
It bears only
your treachery.

43:04.875 --> 43:08.288
My fucking treachery?

43:09.379 --> 43:14.089
When did you stand forth
for Ashur?

43:14.259 --> 43:18.093
When did any of you
greet me

43:18.263 --> 43:20.219
short of mockery
and scorn,

43:20.390 --> 43:23.723
you fucking cunts?

43:27.898 --> 43:29.889
You received
what you deserved

43:30.066 --> 43:32.682
for Barca and all the others
you have betrayed.

43:32.861 --> 43:35.193
Your time is done.

43:44.998 --> 43:48.240
Would that this were
the arena.

43:48.418 --> 43:51.160
Your blood would
dishonor the sand.

43:52.923 --> 43:55.380
Send me on my way then

43:55.550 --> 43:58.838
as you would a gladiator.

44:01.014 --> 44:04.006
Please, Doctore--

44:04.184 --> 44:06.766
a parting kindness.

44:26.790 --> 44:29.782
( screams )

44:29.960 --> 44:31.666
Ashur!

44:32.671 --> 44:34.787
Ashur!

44:34.965 --> 44:37.297
( insects chirping )

45:10.959 --> 45:12.324
Quintus.

45:14.504 --> 45:15.835
Quintus.

45:16.006 --> 45:18.418
You were right.

45:22.470 --> 45:25.382
There is still something
between you and l.

45:27.767 --> 45:30.099
Where is Naevia?

45:31.521 --> 45:33.022
Where?

45:36.109 --> 45:38.350
See me and Dominus
out of the villa

45:38.528 --> 45:40.359
and lwill tell you.

45:43.033 --> 45:44.694
I do not believe you.

45:46.161 --> 45:48.026
Please,

45:48.204 --> 45:50.581
Crixus.

45:53.209 --> 45:55.666
Our child.

46:00.216 --> 46:03.504
I would rather see it dead

46:03.678 --> 46:06.340
than suckle your breast.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.994
We must
conceal ourselves.

46:49.307 --> 46:51.468
Was it yours--

46:51.643 --> 46:55.886
that small, little voice?

46:56.064 --> 46:58.931
Did it form the words
that robbed Varro of his life?

46:59.109 --> 47:01.100
Varro?

47:02.612 --> 47:04.648
He deserved to die.

47:04.823 --> 47:06.814
He was nothing.

47:10.787 --> 47:13.620
What did you know
of the man?

47:13.790 --> 47:18.079
That he would sing
to his child

47:18.253 --> 47:20.869
sleeping in his arms

47:21.047 --> 47:23.288
or kiss the tears
from my cheek

47:23.466 --> 47:25.627
when l was of a mood?

47:25.802 --> 47:29.135
Did you know the father,

47:29.305 --> 47:31.717
the husband?

47:37.981 --> 47:41.144
He was not
a perfect man...

47:44.654 --> 47:47.111
but he was mine.

47:48.867 --> 47:51.825
He was mine!
He was mine!

47:51.995 --> 47:53.701
- ( screams )
- He was mine!

47:53.872 --> 47:56.989
Mine! Mine!

47:59.169 --> 48:00.830
(screaming )

48:01.004 --> 48:02.915
He was mine!

48:03.089 --> 48:06.126
Argh! Mine!

48:06.301 --> 48:09.839
Aurelia.

48:10.013 --> 48:11.719
It's done.

48:12.724 --> 48:14.260
It's done.

48:14.434 --> 48:17.426
(Aurelia sobbing )

48:26.279 --> 48:27.940
Look to the girl.

48:28.114 --> 48:30.150
Is this not enough?

48:30.325 --> 48:32.156
How many more must die?

48:32.327 --> 48:34.864
I would see but one.

48:37.791 --> 48:39.873
lam your dominus.

48:40.043 --> 48:42.284
I will have your
fucking hearts.

48:44.881 --> 48:46.872
Quintus.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.887
Lucretia.

48:56.935 --> 48:59.551
What would you do

48:59.729 --> 49:03.142
to hold your wife again,

49:03.316 --> 49:07.104
to feel the warmth
of her skin,

49:07.278 --> 49:09.894
the taste of her lips?

49:10.073 --> 49:11.688
How many men
would you kill?

49:11.866 --> 49:15.609
A hundred?
A thousand?

49:15.787 --> 49:17.743
There stands but one

49:17.914 --> 49:20.075
between you and her.

49:29.384 --> 49:31.841
Go to her.

49:33.263 --> 49:37.006
Tell her
the gods themselves

49:37.183 --> 49:39.515
would not
keep you apart.

49:41.271 --> 49:45.935
Lie, as you lied to me
of my wife.

49:47.569 --> 49:49.730
Oenomaus.

49:58.454 --> 50:03.073
You were nothing
before me.

50:03.251 --> 50:05.788
I gave you everything.

50:05.962 --> 50:09.204
I gave you the means
to accept your fate.

50:13.261 --> 50:16.799
And now you are
destroyed by it.

50:57.722 --> 51:01.055
Spartacus: l have done this thing
because it is just.

51:01.226 --> 51:04.434
Blood demands blood.

51:08.274 --> 51:11.607
We have lived and lost

51:11.778 --> 51:16.067
at the whims of our masters
for too long.

51:16.241 --> 51:19.028
I would not have it so.

51:21.871 --> 51:24.613
I would not see
the passing of a brother

51:24.791 --> 51:27.954
for the purpose of sport.

51:28.127 --> 51:31.369
I would not see another heart
ripped from chest

51:31.547 --> 51:34.960
or breath forfeit
for no cause.

51:36.594 --> 51:39.552
I know not all of you
wished this.

51:40.556 --> 51:42.592
Yet it is done.

51:44.227 --> 51:47.219
It is done.

51:47.397 --> 51:49.513
Your lives are your own.

51:49.691 --> 51:51.682
Forge your own path

51:51.859 --> 51:53.520
orjoin with us,

51:53.695 --> 51:55.902
and together

51:56.072 --> 51:58.279
we shall see
Rome tremble!

51:58.449 --> 52:00.986
( cheering )

52:11.212 --> 52:11.291
(theme music playing )

52:11.296 --> 52:13.537
(theme music playing )
