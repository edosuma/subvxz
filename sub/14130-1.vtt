EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN

04:37.457 --> 04:40.221
Hello? Have you eaten? Not yet?

04:41.127 --> 04:43.960
Just throw together some noodles
for lunch.

04:44.364 --> 04:46.264
That fish is excellent.

04:47.267 --> 04:50.532
Don't roast it. That would be a pity.

04:51.037 --> 04:53.528
It just needs to be slightly steamed.

04:53.607 --> 04:56.098
Don't add any salt!
Whatever you do, no salt!

04:56.409 --> 04:59.537
Salt dries the fish, and it won't be tender.

04:59.879 --> 05:04.145
Just get a pot of boiling water,
and put salt around the plate.

05:08.355 --> 05:11.347
If not today,
then when will we talk about it?

05:44.424 --> 05:46.449
Small coke, three chickens?

05:46.860 --> 05:48.623
That'll be 100 yuan.

05:48.762 --> 05:51.424
- I ordered chicken!
- That is chicken!

05:53.533 --> 05:56.934
I can't cover for you today.
Guo-Lun is taking me to the beach.

05:57.003 --> 06:00.302
You have to! Father'll kill me
if I'm late for Sunday dinner again.

06:00.373 --> 06:03.001
And I thought you and Guo-Lun broke up!

06:03.109 --> 06:05.805
We did.
I just want to torture him a bit more.

06:05.879 --> 06:09.007
Then torture him
by keeping him waiting an hour.

06:09.783 --> 06:11.717
- Hurry up!
- Great idea!

06:28.935 --> 06:30.766
- Hello?
- How's the new boyfriend?

06:30.837 --> 06:34.000
Hi, Jia-Chien.
Still working on a Sunday afternoon?

06:34.074 --> 06:37.635
New boyfriend's okay, pretty quiet.
Especially after Bo-Kang.

06:37.711 --> 06:38.939
Sounds good.

06:39.012 --> 06:41.674
Let's get together later?
Don't work so hard!

06:41.748 --> 06:46.208
- Thanks, but I'm seeing Raymond later.
- Raymond?

06:46.419 --> 06:48.387
What does that mean?

06:48.488 --> 06:51.423
The difference between Christians
and ordinary people...

06:51.491 --> 06:54.858
...is not only do we have eternal hope...

06:55.462 --> 06:58.795
...but we also rely on God...

06:59.599 --> 07:02.796
...to give us wisdom
to overcome our difficulties...

07:02.869 --> 07:06.669
...and to give us joyfulness and peace
to settle our frustrations.

07:31.965 --> 07:33.227
You okay?

07:35.835 --> 07:38.065
Yeah. Just a little wound up.

07:40.039 --> 07:44.100
Work, you know,
and I just closed on the new apartment.

07:45.145 --> 07:46.908
All my savings...

07:47.280 --> 07:50.772
...but it'll be worth it
to get out of that house.

07:52.152 --> 07:53.881
That was wonderful.

07:55.121 --> 07:58.579
- Better than when we were together.
- It's much easier like this.

08:00.293 --> 08:04.696
We were a disaster as a couple.
All that shouting and fighting.

08:10.136 --> 08:12.195
You want to come down
to my gallery now?

08:12.272 --> 08:15.537
A new woman artist. You'd like her work.

08:15.608 --> 08:19.135
I have to get home
for the Sunday dinner torture ritual.

08:26.085 --> 08:27.746
Punch your time card.

08:27.821 --> 08:31.484
- Change my Sunday schedule, please?
- I'll see what I can do.

08:36.663 --> 08:38.062
Hi, Guo-Lun.

08:39.164 --> 08:41.133
- Hi.
- I'm Chu Jia-Ning.

08:42.635 --> 08:45.900
Rachel asked me to tell you
she'll be an hour late.

08:47.740 --> 08:49.503
Shit! How dare she!

08:49.576 --> 08:53.478
Don't be angry!
It's just an hour, even less now.

08:53.546 --> 08:56.572
It's not the first time
she's made a fool of me.

08:56.649 --> 08:59.413
- It's not serious.
- What would you know?

09:00.153 --> 09:02.485
Have you loved someone who hates you...

09:02.555 --> 09:04.614
...who hurts you every day?

09:04.691 --> 09:07.683
It's my fault, really.
She forgot she was covering for me.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.729
I didn't know I'd cause so much suffering.

09:10.797 --> 09:12.924
You're not to blame. It's me.

09:13.833 --> 09:17.291
I want to end this addiction to love,
but I'm too weak.

09:17.770 --> 09:20.739
- Well, I'd better be going.
- Bye.

09:21.374 --> 09:25.674
Will you tell Rachel to bring back
the red shirt she borrowed?

09:25.979 --> 09:27.970
She can bring it to work.

09:28.348 --> 09:29.610
Whatever.

09:30.016 --> 09:31.813
What are you reading?

09:32.452 --> 09:33.976
Dostoyevsky.

09:35.688 --> 09:36.780
Bye.

10:01.114 --> 10:04.413
- Thank you.
- Promise me we'll go to choir practice?

10:04.484 --> 10:05.746
I'll think about it.

10:05.818 --> 10:08.844
Brother Chai is the handsomest man
in the congregation...

10:08.922 --> 10:10.412
...and he loves your voice!

10:10.490 --> 10:13.948
Sister Chang,
I don't wish to be liked only for my voice!

10:14.027 --> 10:16.461
I'll never find a husband for you!

10:20.833 --> 10:22.460
Then stop trying.

11:00.340 --> 11:04.140
Dear God, please bring luck to our family...

11:04.410 --> 11:06.970
...we are happy to have God in our hearts...

11:07.046 --> 11:11.210
...and thank you so much
for this terrific dinner...

11:11.284 --> 11:15.448
...and thank you again for bringing
our family together with happiness.

11:15.521 --> 11:18.752
In the name of Jesus Christ, thank you.
Amen.

11:36.309 --> 11:38.436
These past two days, I....

11:42.215 --> 11:45.707
- Something wrong?
- No, it's fine.

11:54.594 --> 11:55.822
Nothing.

11:57.397 --> 11:58.659
Say it!

12:01.467 --> 12:03.560
The ham was over smoked.

12:04.270 --> 12:06.704
- It's fine.
- Father probably forgot to taste it.

12:08.474 --> 12:11.671
- Or his taste is getting worse.
- My taste is fine!

12:15.648 --> 12:17.445
- Yesterday--
- Our school--

12:17.517 --> 12:18.643
You first.

12:19.018 --> 12:22.181
Jin-Feng called from America.
Her mother is coming back.

12:22.255 --> 12:26.248
- But her green card?
- She just can't stand it anymore.

12:26.626 --> 12:30.357
They fight and fight. Even the police came.

12:30.430 --> 12:33.729
Mrs. Liang is really hell on wheels.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.862
She can't live there.

12:36.936 --> 12:39.598
The language,
no companion for mah-jongg...

12:39.672 --> 12:43.802
...her son-in-law isn't Chinese.
It's a miracle she lasted that long.

12:43.876 --> 12:48.404
It might be a good thing for Jin-Rong.
She can help take care of Shan-Shan.

12:48.481 --> 12:51.382
- She might cause more stress.
- It'll be fine.

12:51.451 --> 12:54.147
And Dad will have someone to chat with.

12:54.220 --> 12:59.021
Like I have time to gossip
after taking care of you three?

13:03.896 --> 13:05.761
These past two days, I....

13:06.999 --> 13:08.261
What now?

13:09.669 --> 13:12.229
I have a little announcement to make.

13:12.505 --> 13:16.168
Have you seen the TV ads
for "Little Paris in the East"?

13:16.442 --> 13:19.036
That new luxury apartment building
in Hsin-Den?

13:19.112 --> 13:22.809
A friend, who knows the contractors,
told me how well-built it is.

13:22.882 --> 13:25.407
He was able to get my bid in
for a good price.

13:25.485 --> 13:27.146
You're moving out?

13:27.987 --> 13:30.547
Not immediately, of course.
It isn't ready yet.

13:30.623 --> 13:33.717
I used most of my savings for the deposit.

13:33.793 --> 13:35.192
That's good.

13:35.328 --> 13:38.559
Real estate is a smart investment today.

13:39.899 --> 13:42.527
Then I'll move
when the apartment is ready?

13:46.973 --> 13:49.305
- Hello?
- I need to speak with your dad!

13:49.375 --> 13:51.036
Dad, it's for you.

13:51.611 --> 13:54.739
- Hello?
- Hurry here, I need your help....

13:55.047 --> 13:56.708
What? Right away!

14:03.556 --> 14:05.820
There are crab dumplings in the steamer!

14:05.892 --> 14:08.759
Get them out
when you're ready to eat them!

14:33.252 --> 14:35.243
Master Chu, how are you?

14:43.396 --> 14:45.364
Master Chu, how are you?

14:49.669 --> 14:51.603
Hello, Master Chu.

14:55.141 --> 14:56.904
Hello, Master Chu.

15:02.381 --> 15:05.873
- Serve the sea cucumbers first! Hurry!
- Master Chu is here!

15:05.952 --> 15:08.182
Thank God, you're here!

15:08.254 --> 15:11.087
- Where's Old Wen?
- Over here! What a mess!

15:11.357 --> 15:15.691
The boss wanted the banquet to be perfect.
Now look at this mess!

15:16.629 --> 15:18.256
- The menu?
- Here.

15:18.798 --> 15:20.959
What's going on? Hurry up!

15:29.742 --> 15:32.677
It's all right.
The last four courses are stews.

15:32.778 --> 15:35.303
We'll make the Whole Shark Fin,
and problem solved.

15:35.381 --> 15:39.215
With you here, I can relax.
You can take charge here. I'll be up front.

15:39.285 --> 15:42.254
The guy who bought the fins
didn't know anything.

15:42.321 --> 15:45.722
It looked genuine,
but it fell apart when we cooked it.

15:50.229 --> 15:53.596
Fake fins don't have elasticity
when boiled in hot water.

15:53.666 --> 15:56.157
There's no flavor,
no matter how long you cook it.

15:56.235 --> 15:59.295
What will we do now?
It's a wedding for the General's son!

15:59.372 --> 16:00.930
This is only good for gravy.

16:01.007 --> 16:03.635
The Whole Shark Fin dish
will look like a porcupine.

16:03.709 --> 16:05.734
We'll make Joy Luck Dragon Phoenix.

16:05.811 --> 16:09.747
- Abalone? We'll lose money on this!
- Money is not important now.

16:09.815 --> 16:14.275
We'll first settle the situation,
and I'll explain this to the boss later.

16:14.387 --> 16:18.153
Let's get ready, everyone!
I need lobsters, abalone and jade prawns!

16:19.659 --> 16:21.923
On the 10th floor,
and the windows face south.

16:21.994 --> 16:23.484
Central air conditioning?

16:23.562 --> 16:27.555
Of course. There's also a guest room
for you to stay when you visit.

16:30.670 --> 16:32.194
What's wrong?

16:32.638 --> 16:33.866
Nothing.

16:34.373 --> 16:36.466
I don't know why I'm upset.

16:37.009 --> 16:39.034
I should be happy for her.

16:40.012 --> 16:43.004
No, I understand.
I should be the one apologizing.

16:43.082 --> 16:45.380
I shouldn't leave Father in your hands...

16:45.451 --> 16:48.386
...but I just can't live here
with him any more.

16:49.055 --> 16:53.992
Even though I'll be just a few miles away,
it's like being in another world.

16:55.027 --> 16:58.485
- I don't blame you for being upset.
- Why should we be upset?

16:58.564 --> 17:02.330
It's just a matter of time before you
or Jia-Jen gets married and moves out.

17:02.401 --> 17:03.993
What's the difference?

17:04.069 --> 17:07.436
I'm acting upset because
I worry how Father will take it.

17:07.506 --> 17:09.872
He can barely stand
the sight of me these days.

17:09.974 --> 17:13.968
We hardly speak to each other.
It will be a great relief for everyone.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.207
Anyhow, Dad doesn't need us around.

17:16.281 --> 17:18.944
What he really needs
is a companion his own age...

17:19.018 --> 17:20.747
...like Mrs. Liang.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.285
That's not even funny.

17:22.421 --> 17:25.185
We've tried setting him up,
and it's been a disaster.

17:25.257 --> 17:28.784
The only true love in his life
was our mother.

17:28.861 --> 17:31.762
- You call bickering and fighting love?
- What do you know?

17:31.831 --> 17:33.924
Maybe it's not romance to you...

17:33.999 --> 17:37.162
...but it was founded on real
old-fashioned respect and values.

17:37.236 --> 17:41.639
It was an old-fashioned war
that ended only when Mom died!

17:41.874 --> 17:44.672
How would you know?
You were a kid when she died.

17:44.744 --> 17:46.678
I was old enough to know her better.

17:46.746 --> 17:48.373
Stop it, you two.

17:55.454 --> 17:56.648
Try it.

18:02.862 --> 18:04.659
This is how it's done.

18:32.425 --> 18:34.188
Jin-Rong is here!

18:39.231 --> 18:40.255
Hi.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.268
You're all here. Where's Uncle Chu?

18:43.335 --> 18:45.826
Something came up at the restaurant.
He went to help.

18:45.905 --> 18:48.738
Jia-Chien is busy in her room.
Have you eaten?

18:48.808 --> 18:52.972
- It's 8:00! Of course we ate.
- Today, Mom burned the fish.

18:53.045 --> 18:55.275
I didn't bring you along to complain.

18:55.347 --> 18:58.783
I'll give you some of Grandpa Chu's
crab dumplings to take home.

18:58.851 --> 19:02.218
- You got a haircut.
- Yes. I run around like crazy every day.

19:02.288 --> 19:04.848
I don't have time to care for it.
It's easier short.

19:04.924 --> 19:06.983
- You look younger.
- Really?

19:07.059 --> 19:09.391
I wanted to look more professional.

19:09.462 --> 19:11.327
Can we go draw now?

19:14.166 --> 19:16.430
Can we draw Grandpa Chu today?

19:26.912 --> 19:29.676
- Was it really that bad?
- Who knows?

19:29.748 --> 19:33.240
They were both crying and fussing.
Mom said Jin-Feng wasn't being filial.

19:33.319 --> 19:36.413
Jin-Feng said if Mom stayed with them,
she'd end up divorced.

19:36.489 --> 19:39.720
If Jin-Feng got a divorce, too,
my mother really couldn't take it.

19:39.792 --> 19:42.056
I still feel that Jin-Feng should care for her.

19:42.127 --> 19:45.290
With your current situation,
you have a job, take care of a child...

19:45.364 --> 19:48.333
...take care of an elder person,
and deal with your divorce?

19:48.400 --> 19:52.029
Which just got worse. He hired
a private investigator to have me followed.

19:52.104 --> 19:53.298
Really?

19:54.106 --> 19:57.200
He'll do anything to take
Shan-Shan away from me.

19:57.276 --> 19:59.676
I can't wait for the final decree.

20:00.079 --> 20:03.913
- Why don't you tell her to come back later?
- Forget it.

20:04.149 --> 20:07.550
You and Jin-Feng were old schoolmates.
You know her.

20:07.620 --> 20:10.748
Mother always wanted to be with me
instead of her.

20:11.323 --> 20:12.915
Same thing here.

20:13.359 --> 20:15.554
Father wants to live with me.

20:15.628 --> 20:17.289
It's not the same.

20:17.630 --> 20:21.623
Uncle Chu is much stronger than my mom.
He takes care of himself and others.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.066
Unlike my mother,
who needs constant attention.

20:24.136 --> 20:25.967
My dad needs attention, too.

20:26.038 --> 20:28.939
How many more Sunday dinners
can we have?

20:29.008 --> 20:31.533
Jia-Ning is young,
Jia-Chien is independent...

20:31.610 --> 20:34.545
...so I'll have to take care of Dad
for the rest of my life.

20:34.613 --> 20:36.706
I'm sure he doesn't want that.

20:36.782 --> 20:39.808
Mom, look.
Auntie's drawing of Grandpa Chu.

20:42.221 --> 20:43.813
It's time to go home.

20:44.056 --> 20:46.047
Wait, I'll get the dumplings.

20:46.158 --> 20:48.626
Please, don't.
We're always taking food home.

20:48.694 --> 20:52.152
Don't worry,
you're like another daughter in this family.

20:52.264 --> 20:55.290
So you really are like Dad's granddaughter.

20:55.367 --> 20:58.803
- I want to show this to Grandpa Chu.
- Don't, Shan-Shan!

20:59.238 --> 21:01.763
I want to show this to Grandpa Chu!

21:06.078 --> 21:07.978
- Stop running.
- Okay.

21:08.514 --> 21:10.106
I lied, I lied!

21:17.556 --> 21:20.252
Those dumplings are fresh.
Take them home to your kids.

21:20.326 --> 21:22.419
Do you want this to go?

21:23.495 --> 21:25.622
Old Chu, don't get upset.

21:26.131 --> 21:29.191
Girls eventually leave home.
It was bound to happen.

21:29.535 --> 21:30.832
I'm not upset.

21:30.903 --> 21:33.599
I hope they all move out,
so I can have a quiet life.

21:33.672 --> 21:36.197
Quiet life? I know you.

21:36.775 --> 21:40.472
What you want, you can't get.
What you don't want, you can't get rid of.

21:40.546 --> 21:44.038
You're as repressed as a turtle.

21:45.217 --> 21:50.177
That old maid of yours, Jia-Jen,
will stick to you for life...

21:50.756 --> 21:53.190
...unless you marry her off!

21:53.258 --> 21:54.589
Marry who?

21:55.060 --> 21:58.621
Since she lost her asshole
college boyfriend...

21:58.697 --> 22:01.598
...she's never looked at another man.

22:02.234 --> 22:03.667
You know that.

22:04.036 --> 22:06.527
And now she has the perfect boyfriend:

22:06.605 --> 22:08.004
Jesus Christ.

22:08.273 --> 22:10.571
Don't make fun of her religion!

22:11.210 --> 22:15.909
How is it that for 30 years I have
put up with this kind of talk from you?

22:17.116 --> 22:18.515
The truth is...

22:18.584 --> 22:23.146
...you should be thankful
someone's around to tell you the truth.

22:25.391 --> 22:28.155
That Jia-Chien's temper....
She was spoiled as a child.

22:28.227 --> 22:30.092
I can't take it anymore.

22:30.362 --> 22:33.024
That girl just didn't come from nowhere.

22:33.532 --> 22:37.263
Jia-Chien's a perfect blend
of you and her mother.

22:38.137 --> 22:40.901
Her mother's stubbornness and willfulness.

22:40.973 --> 22:43.464
And the pickiness and pomposity...

22:43.942 --> 22:45.967
...come straight from you!

22:47.179 --> 22:49.807
I think I know her better than you do.

22:50.949 --> 22:54.316
I don't understand any of them,
and I don't want to know.

22:54.386 --> 22:56.479
Let them grow up and leave.

22:56.588 --> 22:58.146
It's like cooking.

22:58.223 --> 23:01.056
Your appetite's gone
when the dish is done.

23:01.126 --> 23:04.857
That's not the worst thing.
At least people like your cooking.

23:05.130 --> 23:09.658
Honestly, I'd have to give that up
if it hadn't been for you lately.

23:10.569 --> 23:12.901
My sense of taste
is getting worse and worse.

23:12.971 --> 23:16.168
My food is only as good
as the expression on your face.

23:16.241 --> 23:17.435
Don't be silly.

23:17.509 --> 23:22.242
You rely on your feelings when you cook,
not your taste buds.

23:22.848 --> 23:25.874
Like that Western deaf composer,
called Bee--

23:25.951 --> 23:28.920
- Beethoven.
- That's right, Beethoven.

23:29.054 --> 23:33.548
Good sound is not in the ear,
good taste is not in the mouth...

23:33.826 --> 23:35.384
...and good sex...

23:36.762 --> 23:38.855
...God knows where.

23:39.698 --> 23:41.097
You're drunk.

23:42.968 --> 23:45.493
Eat, drink, man, woman.
Basic human desires.

23:45.571 --> 23:47.198
Can't avoid them.

23:47.706 --> 23:50.675
All my life, every day,
that's all I've ever done.

23:50.743 --> 23:54.304
It pisses me off. Is that all there is to life?

23:54.947 --> 23:58.383
We should be thankful
that we're still alive and cooking.

23:58.450 --> 24:01.681
By the way, when will you have
your recipes written up?

24:01.954 --> 24:03.353
What recipes?

24:03.422 --> 24:07.950
Didn't you say that you wanted to write
down the great recipes from your memory?

24:08.026 --> 24:10.893
I'm just afraid that one day, you'll....

24:10.963 --> 24:12.430
God damn you!

24:12.865 --> 24:16.824
Are you counting the days
to take advantage of the opportunity?

24:17.102 --> 24:18.729
Here, taste this!

24:43.562 --> 24:45.120
Little daughter?

24:47.399 --> 24:48.991
It's 6:00.

24:50.235 --> 24:52.863
Get up, lazy-bones.

25:12.124 --> 25:13.785
Jia-Chien, get up!

25:14.827 --> 25:18.661
How many times have I told you
not to fall asleep at your desk?

25:19.298 --> 25:21.698
It's bad for your posture.

25:22.367 --> 25:26.098
And didn't the doctor tell you that
jogging was bad for your back?

25:55.033 --> 25:57.524
- Shan-Shan!
- Good morning, Grandpa Chu.

25:57.603 --> 26:01.061
Morning! Off to school?
Why are you eating your breakfast here?

26:01.139 --> 26:03.664
I don't have time for breakfast.

26:03.742 --> 26:06.267
Look! Your dumplings from yesterday.

26:06.345 --> 26:11.282
But Mom squeezed the juice out,
so I wouldn't get my hands all greasy.

26:11.450 --> 26:14.283
Come to my house at noon,
and I'll make lunch for you.

26:14.353 --> 26:16.514
- I have school all day.
- All day?

26:16.588 --> 26:18.556
Then where's your lunch box?

26:18.624 --> 26:19.818
Here.

26:20.058 --> 26:21.719
The bus is here!

26:38.176 --> 26:41.475
The valence electron of a typical element...

26:43.148 --> 26:45.275
...is equal to its groups.

26:46.685 --> 26:50.382
And its valence electron in turn
is equal to its groups. Understood?

26:50.455 --> 26:54.186
Okay, let's look at the periodic table
of the elements again.

26:54.259 --> 26:55.817
The Group A elements:

26:56.762 --> 26:57.751
1A...

26:58.297 --> 26:59.286
...2A...

26:59.598 --> 27:00.587
...3A....

27:07.272 --> 27:08.762
Pay attention.

27:09.741 --> 27:13.609
...4A, 5A, 6, 7, 8....

27:14.112 --> 27:18.845
Okay, let's use the color red for Group 1A.
Let's take a look.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.480
- Who will return the ball?
- I'll go!

27:28.126 --> 27:30.117
Very well, then I'll do it.

27:35.834 --> 27:38.268
Hey, where'd it go? Give it back.

27:39.938 --> 27:41.098
Sorry!

27:41.873 --> 27:43.500
Sorry! We missed!

27:43.809 --> 27:45.140
It's okay.

27:45.377 --> 27:48.278
- I'll come up and get it.
- I can throw it down.

27:49.281 --> 27:51.374
She's throwing the bouquet!

27:57.089 --> 27:58.647
Let's continue!

28:02.894 --> 28:04.987
What's going on? What's in your hand?

28:05.063 --> 28:06.655
Nothing, Teacher.

28:06.932 --> 28:10.424
- Bring it here, let me see it.
- There's nothing to see.

28:10.502 --> 28:11.992
Bring it here!

28:13.305 --> 28:14.567
Sit down!

28:16.174 --> 28:17.664
Give it to me.

28:23.348 --> 28:25.873
Writing love letters in chemistry class?

28:25.951 --> 28:28.613
Love letters are
a kind of chemical catalyst.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.150
- Someone wrote it to me.
- So what?

28:31.223 --> 28:33.555
What is this doing in class?

28:33.725 --> 28:36.785
Showing off?
Who hasn't received love letters before?

28:42.801 --> 28:46.259
"A la fin tu es las de ce monde ancien

28:48.907 --> 28:54.277
"Bergère ô tour Eiffel
le troupeau des ponts bêle ce matin"

29:20.238 --> 29:23.401
The American airline industry
is going through a recession.

29:23.475 --> 29:27.377
This is a golden opportunity for us
to bid for the Sydney to Bangkok routes...

29:27.446 --> 29:29.812
...which the British are also eyeing.

29:29.881 --> 29:33.977
They will be our toughest competition,
and the fight will be fierce.

29:36.721 --> 29:40.817
I'll be able to put a price
on these routes within two weeks...

29:40.892 --> 29:44.851
...and I feel that there is
significant potential in all of them.

29:49.201 --> 29:50.293
Good.

29:50.469 --> 29:52.835
Thank you, Deputy Director Chu,
for that report.

29:52.904 --> 29:55.771
Obviously,
this plan poses real opportunities...

29:55.841 --> 29:58.275
...for the growth of our company.

29:58.343 --> 30:02.439
The question is, "Do we have enough
airplanes to handle all these cities?"

30:02.514 --> 30:05.347
Be quiet. What do you know?

30:12.924 --> 30:15.654
That kid. My son just graduated.

30:16.228 --> 30:17.923
He'll get it slowly.

30:18.396 --> 30:19.863
That's right.

30:20.332 --> 30:22.129
Our chief negotiator!

30:22.334 --> 30:25.462
Everyone, please welcome Mr. Li Kai.

30:26.671 --> 30:29.037
He was the one who single-handedly...

30:29.107 --> 30:32.406
...fought to get us our Amsterdam routes.

30:32.911 --> 30:35.345
I'm very happy to see him
as a part of our team.

30:35.413 --> 30:38.678
My apologies for being late.
My flight was delayed.

30:42.888 --> 30:44.617
Always kidding.

30:46.458 --> 30:49.018
We have a big battle to wage.

30:49.294 --> 30:52.821
I want to announce that
Li Kai is our general in charge.

30:53.165 --> 30:57.898
We are to give him
the manpower and assistance he needs.

30:58.403 --> 31:01.236
By following this order,
one observes the energy...

31:01.306 --> 31:03.433
...of the chemical element rising.

31:03.642 --> 31:06.577
- Go home, study hard. Class dismissed.
- Attention.

31:07.379 --> 31:09.313
Stand straight. Bow.

31:09.915 --> 31:12.543
Thank you, Teacher.

31:18.290 --> 31:20.019
Over here, over here.

31:22.627 --> 31:24.492
To the left, to the left!

31:25.397 --> 31:26.989
- Got it!
- Good!

31:45.050 --> 31:46.608
Is it broken?

31:50.255 --> 31:51.779
What happened?

31:52.424 --> 31:55.325
- Coach dislocated his shoulder.
- Dislocated?

31:55.393 --> 31:57.554
My right shoulder always goes.

31:58.363 --> 32:01.890
- We need to rush him to the hospital.
- They're getting Coach Chai.

32:01.967 --> 32:03.457
What for?

32:03.868 --> 32:06.928
What's up? Out again? Come on!

32:15.981 --> 32:18.347
Thanks, Coach! It's as good as new.

32:18.416 --> 32:21.908
- C'mon, let's keep going.
- That's it for today.

32:22.487 --> 32:23.954
Break it up.

32:44.843 --> 32:48.370
Please hurry, and leave for your lunch hour.

32:52.617 --> 32:55.518
Teacher,
I'm bringing Shan-Shan her lunch box.

32:59.257 --> 33:03.489
I didn't have much time to make you
more than a few small dishes.

33:06.765 --> 33:10.132
Spareribs, crab with vegetables...

33:12.737 --> 33:16.537
...shrimp with green peas,
bean sprouts and sliced chicken...

33:16.608 --> 33:20.169
...and your favorite,
spareribs and bitter melon soup.

33:20.312 --> 33:22.974
It's not much,
because I was afraid you can't finish.

33:23.048 --> 33:25.141
Come on, eat while it's hot.

34:16.134 --> 34:18.466
- Sorry.
- Are you catching a bus?

34:20.038 --> 34:22.905
- Your shoulder? Can you ride?
- No problem.

34:23.375 --> 34:26.811
Tomorrow, I'll spike the ball again.
Next week's the big tournament.

34:26.878 --> 34:30.313
- I haven't seen you before.
- I'm the new volleyball coach.

34:30.382 --> 34:32.646
- I'm Chou Ming-Dao.
- Chu Jia-Jen.

34:32.717 --> 34:35.185
- Where do you live?
- Her-Ping East Road.

34:35.253 --> 34:37.687
- That's a nice area.
- It's an old house.

34:37.755 --> 34:40.657
I would have given you a ride
if it were on the way.

34:40.725 --> 34:43.888
- The bus is convenient.
- Well, I'm off.

34:48.333 --> 34:50.893
Come and root for the team next week.

35:20.198 --> 35:21.927
Why are you here?

35:22.600 --> 35:25.364
Guess. I'm here for Rachel...

35:25.437 --> 35:28.736
...who will no doubt keep me waiting
for another hour again.

35:28.807 --> 35:30.866
- I doubt it.
- How do you know?

35:30.942 --> 35:34.571
She got off work an hour ago.
She said she was going home.

35:42.287 --> 35:44.312
Try this. It tastes great.

35:44.456 --> 35:46.390
The smell is making me sick.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.790
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.

35:48.860 --> 35:51.852
No, I feel wonderful. Love is torture.

35:52.330 --> 35:55.493
I know that deep in her heart,
she truly loves me.

35:55.567 --> 35:58.468
But she told me she doesn't love you at all.

35:59.304 --> 36:00.999
If she doesn't love me...

36:01.072 --> 36:03.506
...then why is she wasting her energy
torturing me?

36:03.575 --> 36:06.601
That's not true love.
You hardly know each other.

36:06.678 --> 36:08.373
You two hardly even talk.

36:08.446 --> 36:10.812
Tell me,
when was your last real conversation...

36:10.882 --> 36:13.942
...about your thoughts, feelings and life?

36:16.154 --> 36:18.588
I can't remember. It's all a blur now.

36:18.656 --> 36:21.921
I'll tell you what's a blur: your idea of love.

36:21.993 --> 36:24.553
True love is being with someone
who loves you.

36:24.629 --> 36:27.223
You can feel free to express your feelings.

36:27.298 --> 36:30.392
Next to her,
you can feel free to talk about anything.

36:30.468 --> 36:33.301
But I feel free to talk
about my feelings around you.

36:33.371 --> 36:35.032
Is that true love?

36:38.276 --> 36:39.800
Don't be silly!

36:41.646 --> 36:43.511
Here's your Stinky Tofu.

36:52.056 --> 36:53.387
Bye.

37:14.879 --> 37:18.576
He's still jet-lagged.
He flew in and came straight to work.

37:18.883 --> 37:20.407
Cute, isn't he?

37:48.646 --> 37:50.841
The best way to increase sexual prowess...

37:50.915 --> 37:53.713
...is to mix 3 ounces of ginseng,
3 ounces of aloe vera...

37:53.785 --> 37:56.276
...and 8 ounces of dried sea cucumber.

38:11.636 --> 38:14.969
- What are you doing?
- That cat's driving me crazy.

38:20.211 --> 38:23.271
At least someone's
having some fun around here.

38:24.182 --> 38:27.151
Here they are.
No wonder I couldn't find them.

38:31.289 --> 38:33.484
I'm sorry about that crack.

38:34.092 --> 38:36.356
- I'm sure you'll find someone--
- Oh, please!

38:36.427 --> 38:39.089
Why does everyone think
I'm looking for a boyfriend?

38:39.163 --> 38:41.654
I already found someone, thank you.

38:41.799 --> 38:45.462
Sis, it's been nine years.
You can't still be heartbroken--

38:45.536 --> 38:48.027
- None of your business.
- Fine, then.

38:54.612 --> 38:57.877
It's agreed, then.
I'll make you a lunch box every day.

38:57.949 --> 39:01.248
But sometimes Mama makes me
a lunch box. Then what?

39:01.319 --> 39:04.550
We'll trade. I'll eat your lunch,
and your mom won't find out.

39:04.622 --> 39:07.887
Can you make one for Chen Pei-Hsin, too?
She's my best friend.

39:07.959 --> 39:10.086
We had to eat hamburgers every day.

39:10.161 --> 39:13.426
No problem.
It's a simple job, just more ingredients.

39:13.498 --> 39:15.398
Thank you, Grandpa Chu!

39:29.380 --> 39:30.404
Chief.

39:40.525 --> 39:43.824
- Your plant is dying.
- I always forget to water it.

39:46.497 --> 39:49.466
- You can't take it with you, anyhow.
- Am I fired?

39:49.534 --> 39:51.866
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

39:51.936 --> 39:56.930
Of course, it's premature to tell you this.
I still need approval from the board.

39:57.175 --> 40:01.339
I've recommended you to be vice-president
of our Amsterdam office...

40:01.546 --> 40:04.014
...in charge of all our operations.

40:04.282 --> 40:05.647
Chief, I....

40:06.250 --> 40:09.811
Frankly,
you're much too young for the position...

40:10.354 --> 40:12.083
...and too beautiful.

40:12.223 --> 40:15.386
But all the men I've sent over are idiots...

40:15.860 --> 40:17.725
...so you'll have to do.

40:17.895 --> 40:19.886
But, Chief, I....

40:21.199 --> 40:24.396
Everyone wants this job.
What are you waiting for?

40:25.737 --> 40:28.205
- I just purchased an apartment.
- Rent it out.

40:28.272 --> 40:30.502
You'll probably make a profit.

40:30.875 --> 40:34.868
Then again, let's wait until the board
confirms your appointment.

40:54.465 --> 40:56.228
I felt like cooking.

40:58.636 --> 41:00.661
The kitchen is all yours.

41:22.527 --> 41:24.290
This is Tsu-An Tofu.

41:24.695 --> 41:28.688
Unfortunately, you don't have
a bamboo steamer, but taste it anyway.

41:29.634 --> 41:32.762
- Where's the tofu?
- The tofu is blended in with the chicken.

41:32.837 --> 41:36.136
It's steamed in the pot
until it looks like a beehive...

41:36.207 --> 41:40.041
...which is then cut into pieces
and stewed with ham in an old hen broth.

41:40.111 --> 41:42.705
You shouldn't have rewarded me like this.

41:42.780 --> 41:45.943
I like cooking elaborate dishes.
I wish I could do it at home.

41:46.017 --> 41:50.215
- You can't cook tofu at home?
- No, I can't cook at home.

41:50.955 --> 41:53.822
- Doesn't your dad have a big kitchen?
- Yes.

41:54.091 --> 41:58.619
But it's off-limits to me.
If I cooked there, he'd come and stop me...

41:58.696 --> 42:00.721
...as if I'd be stealing his thunder.

42:05.236 --> 42:08.728
Carp with garlic sauce,
the first dish Uncle Wen taught me.

42:11.943 --> 42:15.344
And this is duck-oil sautéed pea sprout.
One duck, two dishes.

42:15.413 --> 42:18.678
Duck sautéed with garlic.
A perfect balance.

42:18.816 --> 42:23.185
It's an ancient philosophy: food balanced
with energy, flavor and nature.

42:23.254 --> 42:26.087
This I understand.
Like balancing yin and yang.

42:26.958 --> 42:30.394
Take your time.
There's also a tofu dumpling coming up.

42:30.761 --> 42:32.592
There's enough for 10 people.

42:32.663 --> 42:37.100
I always cook in large servings,
because I learned in a large restaurant.

42:37.535 --> 42:39.696
- That kitchen....
- What?

42:41.138 --> 42:43.732
It's strange,
I don't have any childhood memories...

42:43.808 --> 42:46.299
...unless I cook them into existence.

42:46.811 --> 42:49.211
I can't remember a thing
from my childhood.

42:49.280 --> 42:53.478
You wouldn't believe
how fun and warm my father used to be.

42:54.585 --> 42:57.145
Back then, after school,
before the dinner rush...

42:57.221 --> 42:59.951
...he'd bake me bracelets made of bread.

43:00.258 --> 43:02.123
I used to have a ring...

43:02.894 --> 43:07.388
...full of spices and sugar diamonds
made from dough.

43:08.032 --> 43:11.001
He enjoyed letting me play
in the big kitchen.

43:11.068 --> 43:13.059
Jia-Jen was so jealous.

43:14.038 --> 43:17.496
- Here, wear this squid ring, and then eat it.
- Don't play.

43:17.575 --> 43:19.600
How about nibbling my earring?

43:20.945 --> 43:22.412
Stop playing.

43:26.450 --> 43:29.078
I'm sorry I got so sentimental tonight.

43:32.356 --> 43:34.586
No, I just had too much to eat.

43:39.830 --> 43:41.525
The pepper smells good.

43:48.139 --> 43:49.333
How is it?

43:49.640 --> 43:50.971
Too spicy?

43:51.442 --> 43:54.934
Say something!
Don't make me guess your expressions.

43:56.814 --> 43:59.510
Old Wen!

44:04.855 --> 44:09.451
Name, address, social security number,
family status, relatives.

44:09.527 --> 44:13.293
If he needs special care,
please fill out this bottom section.

44:13.731 --> 44:17.030
- Dad.
- You're here. It's okay now.

44:17.702 --> 44:20.364
They ran some tests in the ER.
He feels better now.

44:20.438 --> 44:23.930
- Was it a heart attack?
- We'll have to do more tests.

44:24.308 --> 44:26.868
- Do you have a pen?
- I'll fill it out.

44:33.784 --> 44:35.115
Uncle Wen.

44:35.619 --> 44:36.950
Jia-Chien.

44:38.055 --> 44:43.015
Just like me to be practically killed
by a fart.

44:44.462 --> 44:46.396
Blame your father's cooking.

44:46.664 --> 44:49.599
His cooking is getting worse and worse
these days.

44:49.767 --> 44:51.394
You had too much of it.

44:51.469 --> 44:53.767
Come on, give Uncle Wen a hug.

44:58.009 --> 45:01.274
- Why'd you grow up to be so pretty?
- To be courted by men.

45:01.879 --> 45:05.315
It seems like only yesterday,
you were a little girl...

45:05.950 --> 45:09.249
...following your father and I
around the kitchen.

45:10.488 --> 45:12.012
Back and forth.

45:12.390 --> 45:16.554
You were so smart.
You learned everything just once.

45:17.495 --> 45:20.726
- What a talent. Right, Old Chu?
- Of course.

45:22.199 --> 45:24.963
What's the use?
You still banished me from the kitchen.

45:25.036 --> 45:28.563
It was for your own good.
You should learn something useful.

45:28.739 --> 45:31.173
You just can't accept a woman
being a great chef.

45:31.242 --> 45:33.870
Don't start again, you two. Jia-Chien...

45:34.345 --> 45:39.078
...if you wanted to be a chef,
you would've been one of the greats.

45:39.417 --> 45:42.818
But your father was right
to send you to college.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.220
You should thank your father...

45:45.356 --> 45:48.416
...for throwing you out
of our smelly kitchen.

45:48.492 --> 45:51.518
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have what you have today.

45:52.129 --> 45:54.859
No one ever asked me if I'd appreciate this.

45:57.234 --> 45:59.964
Don't hold a grudge against your father.

46:00.538 --> 46:03.974
He's getting old
and just as confused as I am.

46:04.742 --> 46:09.304
But I know that in his heart,
he's extremely proud of you.

46:11.348 --> 46:12.975
Just look at him.

46:13.250 --> 46:17.846
He keeps all of his feelings and emotions
bottled up inside him.

46:18.622 --> 46:22.422
Someday,
he'll have to express himself to you...

46:23.527 --> 46:26.621
...or he'll end up in a hospital
with something...

46:27.064 --> 46:30.932
...worse than an upset stomach.

46:47.084 --> 46:50.247
There's 10 yuan in change.
Why didn't you ask for it?

46:50.554 --> 46:53.580
We're lucky he got us here
through the traffic in the rain!

46:53.657 --> 46:57.855
The meter was running! If there's money
to be made, they'll make it!

46:58.496 --> 47:01.260
Tell him to get out
and help with the luggage!

47:01.832 --> 47:04.528
They're supposed to carry
the luggage for tips!

47:04.602 --> 47:07.628
Just like your sister,
you throw out tips like water.

47:07.705 --> 47:11.163
But how much does your sister make
compared to you?

47:12.343 --> 47:13.605
Let's go.

47:14.178 --> 47:17.341
You're all alone now.
Save as much as you can.

47:17.414 --> 47:20.042
Who are you gonna depend on
when you get old?

47:20.117 --> 47:23.314
I'll be depending on whomever
you're depending on!

47:25.723 --> 47:27.452
What? No elevator?

47:37.067 --> 47:40.730
He hasn't come by in a week.
He didn't even call me.

47:41.939 --> 47:43.839
Maybe he's busy with exams.

47:44.208 --> 47:47.905
Weren't you ignoring him?
Didn't you want to break up with him?

47:48.012 --> 47:51.072
No. I was just playing hard to get.

47:51.148 --> 47:53.048
I love him, you know.

47:54.285 --> 47:56.219
I think I really love him.

47:56.587 --> 47:59.021
That's strange. Is it because....

48:00.891 --> 48:03.485
Why is he ignoring me all of a sudden?

48:03.861 --> 48:05.658
What should I do?

48:07.631 --> 48:10.429
You honestly think we can
pull that many out of Sydney?

48:10.501 --> 48:12.662
Why not Bangkok? Or Osaka?

48:13.103 --> 48:17.130
I showed you the projections yesterday.
Do you still have questions?

48:17.241 --> 48:18.640
That's right.

48:19.643 --> 48:21.008
Sorry.

48:21.078 --> 48:25.139
I'm not used to working with someone
who's not a certifiable idiot.

48:25.683 --> 48:28.117
Or maybe you're a little too smug?

48:28.319 --> 48:31.083
Probably, but you know what I mean.

48:31.155 --> 48:33.646
Maybe it's because
I sometimes get a flash...

48:33.724 --> 48:36.454
...about how meaningless all this crap is.

48:36.860 --> 48:38.828
Or maybe I'm just tired.

48:40.664 --> 48:43.531
- You want some tea?
- I want liquor.

48:44.768 --> 48:47.862
I sense a bottle of scotch in the vicinity.

49:15.332 --> 49:17.926
- How did you know?
- Educated guess.

49:18.535 --> 49:21.129
I figured you spend so much time in here.

49:21.205 --> 49:23.935
Am I really that much of an old maid?

49:24.475 --> 49:26.204
No, far from it!

49:26.810 --> 49:29.836
You remind me of when I was a student.

49:30.381 --> 49:33.214
The smartest were often the wildest.

49:33.517 --> 49:37.317
We used to make liquor in chemistry lab
and hide it behind the blackboard.

49:37.388 --> 49:38.855
So you were a chemist?

49:40.190 --> 49:43.353
That's what I studied to be
in a prior lifetime.

49:45.596 --> 49:48.793
- Then why this?
- Business? The airline business?

49:50.000 --> 49:53.265
- The same way you did.
- Well, I didn't really plan this.

49:53.704 --> 49:54.932
Exactly.

49:57.274 --> 49:58.798
To your health.

50:08.285 --> 50:11.880
Why did the two of you
turn in your homework so late?

50:11.989 --> 50:14.549
Take a look at your work.
Practically identical.

50:14.625 --> 50:16.422
I better not see this again.

50:23.867 --> 50:26.665
You appeared like May sunshine
with your rose smile

50:26.737 --> 50:28.364
Spreading love and warmth

51:10.481 --> 51:12.472
Torturing yourself again?

51:13.350 --> 51:15.580
Actually, I'm waiting for you.

51:58.262 --> 52:01.459
- Do you live here?
- Nobody lives here. I just sleep here.

52:01.532 --> 52:04.695
- Your parents?
- In China, eyeing real estate deals.

52:04.768 --> 52:07.498
They stop by once in a while
to check up on the place.

52:07.571 --> 52:08.833
Busy making money.

52:08.906 --> 52:11.033
- Do they stay downstairs?
- No.

52:11.241 --> 52:14.176
Just a tenant downstairs.
My grandma used to live there...

52:14.244 --> 52:17.236
...but since her stroke,
my parents put her in a nursing home.

52:17.314 --> 52:20.340
- Would you like something to drink?
- Some ice water.

52:46.777 --> 52:48.108
Ice water.

52:53.383 --> 52:55.180
It's very quiet here.

52:55.586 --> 52:58.111
- Do you want to hear some music?
- No.

53:00.557 --> 53:02.457
- Are these yours?
- Yeah.

53:02.893 --> 53:05.327
I didn't know you were into photography.

53:05.395 --> 53:09.491
Not really, I only take pictures
of my grandmother. I visit her every week.

53:09.600 --> 53:12.728
The camera seems to be
the only thing she responds to...

53:12.803 --> 53:14.293
...you know...

53:15.572 --> 53:17.199
...with her eyes.

53:17.574 --> 53:19.303
Probably the flash.

53:19.743 --> 53:21.335
She can't talk?

53:22.412 --> 53:25.176
Maybe she doesn't want
to be photographed.

53:25.449 --> 53:27.849
I had the same thought but....

53:36.026 --> 53:37.653
Here she comes.

54:28.072 --> 54:32.338
I'm on the 10th floor.
There is a window view overlooking Taipei.

54:34.845 --> 54:37.575
- Why can't we go in?
- It must be dangerous.

54:38.315 --> 54:40.909
Oh, no! It's a big fraud.

54:41.485 --> 54:44.181
The police shut it down.

54:45.189 --> 54:48.818
- What do you mean?
- This land is a toxic waste dump.

54:49.193 --> 54:52.754
Can't you smell the poison?

54:53.997 --> 54:55.862
I don't smell a thing.

54:56.200 --> 55:00.534
Hope you weren't one of the suckers
who bought it. The company's bankrupt!

55:00.871 --> 55:03.362
The company took the money and ran.

55:19.490 --> 55:22.357
I told you, you should have invested in art.

55:23.627 --> 55:25.322
Sorry. Bad joke.

55:25.796 --> 55:27.923
Just wanted to cheer you up.

55:28.732 --> 55:31.257
If you don't want to stay at home...

55:32.503 --> 55:34.562
...I can help you find a place.

55:37.074 --> 55:38.564
You all right?

55:39.042 --> 55:41.636
Oddly, I feel light and free.

55:42.846 --> 55:46.043
- Free enough to fly to Amsterdam!
- Exactly.

55:57.194 --> 55:59.094
Where is Mr. Wen in Room 22?

55:59.163 --> 56:02.826
He checked out this morning
against his doctor's advice.

56:02.900 --> 56:06.131
- Are you his relative?
- He's my father's associate.

56:24.121 --> 56:26.681
Miss, which way is the elevator?

56:26.757 --> 56:29.385
- Straight down, turn left.
- Thanks.

56:40.037 --> 56:41.299
This way.

57:03.727 --> 57:05.058
Excuse me.

57:15.639 --> 57:19.871
Paging Cardiovascular, Dr. Wang Tze-Chen,
please report to room....

57:21.044 --> 57:22.739
- Sorry.
- May I help you?

57:22.813 --> 57:25.281
- What department is this?
- Cardiovascular.

57:25.349 --> 57:26.680
Thank you.

58:23.273 --> 58:24.535
Jia-Ning?

58:27.044 --> 58:29.137
Wake up, sleepyhead.

58:42.859 --> 58:43.883
Morning.

58:45.128 --> 58:46.618
Morning, Dad.

59:33.810 --> 59:35.209
Thanks, Dad.

59:42.285 --> 59:45.743
Dad forgot to add the shrimp paste
in the flat mushroom.

59:54.531 --> 59:56.192
Mrs. Liang is back.

59:56.666 --> 01:00:00.227
She repeatedly tells Jin-Rong
what happened in America...

01:00:00.504 --> 01:00:01.971
...driving her crazy.

01:00:02.038 --> 01:00:05.474
Shan-Shan said Mrs. Liang's cooking
is worse than her mother's.

01:00:09.679 --> 01:00:11.977
I have an announcement to make.

01:00:12.883 --> 01:00:16.011
It's about my work.
Lately, my company is--

01:00:16.353 --> 01:00:20.483
You don't need to tell us. We read
about your apartment in the paper.

01:00:20.557 --> 01:00:22.422
What are you going to do?

01:00:22.692 --> 01:00:24.819
Can't you get your money back?

01:00:25.595 --> 01:00:29.053
Did you put all of your savings
in that apartment?

01:00:30.267 --> 01:00:31.598
Of course...

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:36.070
...you may continue to live here.

01:00:50.987 --> 01:00:53.251
Your t-shirts were in my closet.

01:00:53.323 --> 01:00:56.622
These are yours.
He should let us sort our own clothes.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.125
He seems preoccupied lately.

01:00:59.196 --> 01:01:02.324
Exactly. Would I wear
old-fashioned underwear like these?

01:01:02.399 --> 01:01:04.230
Did my underwear offend you?

01:01:04.301 --> 01:01:07.099
- You know what I mean.
- I'm afraid I don't.

01:01:18.148 --> 01:01:20.946
- Dad, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:01:25.489 --> 01:01:28.356
- Why did you ask?
- No, it's just that....

01:01:29.392 --> 01:01:31.553
- Do I look bad?
- No....

01:01:35.298 --> 01:01:36.560
I'm fine!

01:01:49.613 --> 01:01:52.878
- Grandpa Chu!
- Shan-Shan, Jin-Rong, come in!

01:01:55.385 --> 01:01:59.185
I should have come sooner
to visit and thank you in person.

01:01:59.422 --> 01:02:03.984
Jin-Rong is too busy to bring me over.
I almost had to force her to take me.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.652
She said that you and your whole family
really took care of them.

01:02:07.731 --> 01:02:11.690
It's only my duty. Jia-Jen and Jin-Feng
were good classmates.

01:02:13.169 --> 01:02:16.229
You took care of my daughter
when she was in Tainan.

01:02:16.306 --> 01:02:19.002
Now that Jin-Rong is alone in Taipei....

01:02:19.075 --> 01:02:21.635
- Shan-Shan!
- Little Aunt, can we draw?

01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:23.540
- For Uncle Chu.
- Thanks, but--

01:02:23.613 --> 01:02:26.844
- Jia-Jen, it's been so long.
- Mrs. Liang!

01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:29.317
- Still teaching at the same school?
- Yes.

01:02:29.386 --> 01:02:31.513
- Still not married?
- Yes.

01:02:32.055 --> 01:02:35.081
Frankly, marriage is quite meaningless.

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:39.189
A bad marriage is such a burden.
You might as well get a divorce.

01:02:39.262 --> 01:02:43.096
You have to be insane to marry
such a loser, like Jin-Rong's husband.

01:02:43.466 --> 01:02:46.196
It's like a tired dog
dragging some broken cart.

01:02:46.336 --> 01:02:48.930
And in the end, you're left all alone.

01:02:49.005 --> 01:02:51.064
- Isn't that so, Mr. Chu?
- Yes.

01:02:51.141 --> 01:02:54.577
- Ma, why do you have to say that?
- But it's true!

01:02:54.644 --> 01:02:57.135
- Prepare some fruit, Jia-Jen.
- Okay.

01:02:57.414 --> 01:02:59.609
- Your second daughter?
- The youngest.

01:02:59.683 --> 01:03:02.243
- Hello, Mrs. Liang.
- How old are you?

01:03:02.485 --> 01:03:05.147
- Twenty.
- It's time to have a boyfriend.

01:03:05.221 --> 01:03:07.951
Don't wait too long like your older sister.

01:03:08.058 --> 01:03:11.255
- Let's sit down.
- Let me make some tea.

01:03:11.428 --> 01:03:13.487
- Can we draw now?
- All right.

01:03:15.165 --> 01:03:16.860
- Mrs. Liang.
- You are?

01:03:17.067 --> 01:03:18.967
- Jia-Chien.
- That's right.

01:03:19.035 --> 01:03:20.696
You're No. 2.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:23.000
- Aren't you pretty?
- Thank you.

01:03:23.306 --> 01:03:27.367
- Are you used to Taipei yet?
- It's okay. Good to be home.

01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:30.746
Do you have a boyfriend?
I'm sure you have several.

01:03:31.214 --> 01:03:33.079
Keep your options open.

01:03:33.149 --> 01:03:37.210
Don't listen to what men say,
but watch their actions. Understood?

01:03:38.054 --> 01:03:40.079
Isn't that right, Mr. Chu?

01:03:42.258 --> 01:03:45.455
- Your daughters aren't bad.
- Your daughters are fine, too.

01:03:45.528 --> 01:03:47.519
Mine are no good.

01:03:47.597 --> 01:03:51.590
My oldest is in the middle of
this nasty divorce.

01:03:51.668 --> 01:03:56.037
Her husband was so sordid.
He fools around with several other women.

01:03:56.339 --> 01:03:58.500
I can't even mention the details.

01:03:58.575 --> 01:04:01.942
And there's my youngest
with her white husband...

01:04:02.178 --> 01:04:05.079
...who plays electric guitar
in the garage all weekend.

01:04:05.148 --> 01:04:07.412
He eats hamburgers with onions every day.

01:04:07.484 --> 01:04:10.248
And when I fry rice,
the smoke alarm goes off!

01:04:10.387 --> 01:04:13.720
I tell you,
it was like a living hell there for me.

01:04:14.057 --> 01:04:17.993
- Mr. Chu, I'm sure you don't mind, do you?
- Of course not. Please.

01:04:19.396 --> 01:04:20.727
Old witch.

01:04:26.803 --> 01:04:28.395
A breeze blows in...

01:04:30.206 --> 01:04:33.107
...fluttering through your clothes,
across your smile.

01:04:47.357 --> 01:04:51.157
In a dreamy garret,
I am keeping my late autumn love for you.

01:04:54.097 --> 01:04:56.031
"Late autumn love...."

01:05:46.316 --> 01:05:49.251
"So many times,
I want to say 'I love you'

01:05:50.386 --> 01:05:53.412
"So often,
I want to say "I'm sorry"

01:05:55.525 --> 01:05:59.621
"You cried, 'This is fate. It's over'

01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:03.990
"It's over"

01:06:08.238 --> 01:06:10.069
How are you, Teacher?

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.802
"But give me just one moment

01:06:12.876 --> 01:06:15.208
"One more look

01:06:15.278 --> 01:06:17.746
"Don't take everything away

01:06:18.014 --> 01:06:20.346
"Another chance

01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:22.941
"A little tenderness

01:06:23.419 --> 01:06:26.582
"Don’t let me hurt so bad

01:06:37.033 --> 01:06:40.469
"You can make me happy

01:06:41.337 --> 01:06:44.397
"Make me sad

01:06:45.608 --> 01:06:50.477
"Make me willing to give you...

01:06:53.183 --> 01:06:55.344
"...everything"

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.926
Thank you. Thank you.

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:09.658
I'm new here,
so I'm not familiar with everyone.

01:07:09.732 --> 01:07:12.166
So I nominate Teacher Chu for a song.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.171
Be careful.

01:07:21.644 --> 01:07:23.509
Teacher, what do you want to sing?

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.640
That won't be necessary.
I'll sing Love's Commandments.

01:07:29.118 --> 01:07:33.384
"Love is forever, patient, and kind

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:37.350
"Love isn’t jealous

01:07:39.229 --> 01:07:43.325
"Love isn't boastful or crazy

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.297
"Love doesn't do shameful things"

01:07:56.679 --> 01:07:59.045
A soprano! You have a great voice.

01:07:59.115 --> 01:08:01.811
- You, too.
- I wanted to ask you a question.

01:08:02.085 --> 01:08:04.076
Are you free this Sunday?

01:08:05.088 --> 01:08:08.990
I'm taking the volleyball team on an outing.
Do you want to come?

01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:12.193
- An outing?
- You should get some sun.

01:08:12.662 --> 01:08:15.153
Join us if you've got nothing else to do.

01:08:15.632 --> 01:08:18.192
Think about it, and let me know. Bye!

01:08:49.064 --> 01:08:52.363
Don't crowd me! Be quiet!

01:08:53.069 --> 01:08:55.799
- What do you want?
- Curried beef and rice.

01:08:58.308 --> 01:09:00.401
- And you?
- Fried rice with eggs.

01:09:00.475 --> 01:09:04.173
It's too easy for Grandpa Chu.
He won't do it. Something more difficult.

01:09:06.549 --> 01:09:09.814
Here is Mom's lunch box
and tomorrow's menu.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.778
Bye.

01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:33.832
You're right. The Sydney route
is worth half as much as they're asking.

01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:37.368
To think that the Chief
was going to offer $30 million.

01:09:46.723 --> 01:09:49.850
Great. This is why
you get paid the big bucks.

01:09:50.225 --> 01:09:53.457
- No wonder you're so tired all the time.
- You should try it.

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:57.124
In one morning, I've already killed
2,000 aliens and saved the world.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.636
- What did you accomplish this morning?
- A small headache.

01:10:01.037 --> 01:10:03.699
How could you kill those cute aliens?

01:10:07.977 --> 01:10:10.036
I remember now. Forget it.

01:10:10.713 --> 01:10:14.114
- You have time to give me a hand?
- Sure.

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.984
I always wanted to find
something Chinese for him.

01:10:20.056 --> 01:10:21.956
He has plenty of these already.

01:10:22.025 --> 01:10:24.687
- He's interested in Chinese culture?
- I wish.

01:10:24.761 --> 01:10:29.164
I can't believe that in a few years,
my son is growing up to be an American.

01:10:29.232 --> 01:10:32.531
Sometimes I look at him
and wonder if he's actually my son.

01:10:32.602 --> 01:10:35.264
He was raised in America,
and his mother doesn't mind.

01:10:35.338 --> 01:10:38.603
His mother? How does she feel
about you being away all the time?

01:10:38.674 --> 01:10:40.699
She's glad I'm not around.

01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:43.945
I think the only reason we're not divorced...

01:10:44.447 --> 01:10:47.280
...is that we're both too busy.

01:10:48.217 --> 01:10:50.185
That sounds so cynical, doesn't it?

01:10:50.253 --> 01:10:53.711
I'm just as cynical
when it comes to my personal life.

01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:58.952
- Sometimes I wish I could just....
- Pick up and fly away.

01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:02.660
Seems like that's what
you'll be doing pretty soon.

01:11:02.732 --> 01:11:05.257
I thought that was the answer, too.

01:11:05.835 --> 01:11:09.703
As a result, I really messed things up
after I graduated from Chen-Kong.

01:11:09.772 --> 01:11:12.036
- Chen-Kong University?
- Yeah.

01:11:12.208 --> 01:11:16.167
After graduation, my old man had a post
for me in his chemical business.

01:11:16.245 --> 01:11:18.179
- Chemical?
- That's right.

01:11:18.347 --> 01:11:20.508
Remember the whiskey lab?

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:24.351
I actually enjoyed it as a subject.
It's the chaos in my life.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.117
There was a lot of pressure
from my parents, my girlfriend.

01:11:28.524 --> 01:11:31.084
I guess I didn't have the courage. So I left.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.219
Then you went to the U.S.?

01:11:34.263 --> 01:11:38.324
It wasn't great, but it was better
for everyone in the long run.

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.202
You okay?

01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:50.503
- This looks Chinese.
- That's Harvey.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.511
You have no idea how much I suffered
from those kids' shows.

01:11:55.017 --> 01:11:56.746
Wanna hear the theme?

01:11:57.019 --> 01:11:58.953
- "I love--"
- Please don't.

01:11:59.755 --> 01:12:03.122
What the hell, I'll just buy this one.
He'll like it.

01:12:20.764 --> 01:12:22.061
Uncle Chu!

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.458
Jin-Rong, what's wrong?
Is it the detective?

01:12:27.237 --> 01:12:31.230
No. Shan-Shan is not feeling well.
She won't be going to school.

01:12:31.842 --> 01:12:33.173
So you...?

01:12:33.377 --> 01:12:36.869
I was wondering why her lunch box
was always so clean.

01:12:37.081 --> 01:12:40.244
No one could ever finish
all my short ribs before!

01:12:40.784 --> 01:12:43.309
- Hope you don't mind.
- Of course not.

01:12:43.587 --> 01:12:46.647
But what about the lunches
I'd prepared for her?

01:12:46.724 --> 01:12:49.420
I ate them myself, down to the last bite.

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:53.957
How embarrassing.
A master chef like you, eating my lunches.

01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:55.760
I was more than happy to.

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:59.963
Besides, I lost my sense of taste,
so it's the feeling that counts.

01:13:01.905 --> 01:13:03.896
All right. I should go now.

01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:06.866
Don't tell Shan-Shan
that I know about this.

01:13:06.944 --> 01:13:10.812
- She'd like a little secret between you two.
- Yes, I understand.

01:13:11.014 --> 01:13:12.072
Bye.

01:13:20.491 --> 01:13:22.686
I loved him so much.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.026
How could he do this to me?

01:13:27.164 --> 01:13:29.189
You hardly cared for him.

01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:31.634
I was only pretending...

01:13:32.269 --> 01:13:35.329
...because my love for him was so strong!

01:13:35.639 --> 01:13:39.370
I was scared of its intensity.
I feel humiliated!

01:13:39.443 --> 01:13:41.570
I went to see him, and he....

01:13:42.513 --> 01:13:44.674
I don't want to live anymore.

01:13:46.984 --> 01:13:49.680
If I only knew, then I wouldn't have....

01:13:50.354 --> 01:13:52.151
I thought you two....

01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:01.297
Chu Jia-Ning.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.894
You....

01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:07.535
You two....

01:14:20.684 --> 01:14:22.413
Dad, do you need any help?

01:14:22.486 --> 01:14:24.647
Call your sisters to dinner.

01:14:26.423 --> 01:14:27.617
Dad....

01:14:29.726 --> 01:14:30.784
Go.

01:14:48.378 --> 01:14:51.779
Can't they stop for once? It's so annoying.

01:14:52.182 --> 01:14:56.243
We communicate by eating.
So what's wrong with singing karaoke?

01:15:07.698 --> 01:15:09.996
I have an announcement to make.

01:15:11.635 --> 01:15:13.865
I know it sounds incredible...

01:15:14.137 --> 01:15:16.571
...but a lot of times
things happen this way.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.631
Which class did you fail?

01:15:19.209 --> 01:15:21.370
I met a boy. A man.

01:15:21.812 --> 01:15:24.178
We're in love. We plan to live together.

01:15:24.248 --> 01:15:27.411
His family has a huge apartment,
and his parents will like me.

01:15:27.484 --> 01:15:30.817
So I plan on moving in with them.
But the main reason is...

01:15:31.555 --> 01:15:33.455
...I’m having his baby.

01:15:51.742 --> 01:15:53.175
Bye, Dad.

01:16:24.007 --> 01:16:25.497
That Jia-Ning.

01:16:26.076 --> 01:16:28.306
I'm still in a state of shock.

01:16:31.315 --> 01:16:33.943
Do you think Dad's okay? Where'd he go?

01:16:34.384 --> 01:16:36.909
He's probably chatting with Mrs. Liang.

01:16:36.987 --> 01:16:40.320
Don't worry about him.
Take off to Amsterdam.

01:16:40.724 --> 01:16:42.885
Just do what you have to do.

01:16:47.064 --> 01:16:49.464
Go ahead. I really meant it.

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:57.137
Sis, do you ever think about what
might have been if you had stayed with...

01:16:58.809 --> 01:17:00.800
...what's his name again?

01:17:01.979 --> 01:17:03.173
Li Kai.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:07.141
Had you left to the US
with Li Kai after graduation...

01:17:07.351 --> 01:17:09.410
...what things might have been like?

01:17:09.486 --> 01:17:11.181
Why are you asking?

01:17:11.388 --> 01:17:15.324
- Your life could've been different.
- What's wrong with my life now?

01:17:15.392 --> 01:17:17.690
Do you want to be stuck here forever?

01:17:17.761 --> 01:17:20.389
- What if I told you I saw--
- That's enough.

01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:22.361
This is my home, and it's fine.

01:17:22.432 --> 01:17:26.027
"This is my home, and it's fine,"
but it isn't everything!

01:17:26.536 --> 01:17:30.438
But it's Dad's everything!
I know him far better than you do!

01:17:34.711 --> 01:17:37.874
Why is it that you feel
that you have to meddle in my life?

01:17:37.948 --> 01:17:41.111
What gives you the right
to tell me what to feel?

01:17:41.785 --> 01:17:43.252
That's right...

01:17:43.954 --> 01:17:46.445
...my heart was broken by Li Kai.

01:17:48.258 --> 01:17:52.319
And you probably think that I'm pathetic
for never getting over it.

01:17:52.396 --> 01:17:54.694
But at least I had a heart to break.

01:17:54.865 --> 01:17:56.765
I don't need your pity.

01:17:58.301 --> 01:18:00.701
And what do you know of my heart?

01:18:01.838 --> 01:18:03.499
Nothing whatsoever...

01:18:04.307 --> 01:18:08.243
...because you never felt that
I was worth sharing your feelings with.

01:18:08.311 --> 01:18:09.505
You're wrong.

01:18:09.579 --> 01:18:13.572
Ever since Mom died,
you acted more like a parent than a sister.

01:18:14.284 --> 01:18:15.876
You shut me out.

01:18:24.428 --> 01:18:26.089
I thought you hated me.

01:18:28.465 --> 01:18:29.625
Never.

01:18:36.873 --> 01:18:38.534
I broke the plate.

01:18:40.377 --> 01:18:41.708
It's okay.

01:18:58.028 --> 01:19:00.121
Hi, if it’s Bo-Kang, stop calling me.

01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:03.063
If it’s Mom,
get Dad to drink the healthy tea.

01:19:03.133 --> 01:19:06.534
Everyone else, please leave a message.
Okay, leave a message.

01:19:07.571 --> 01:19:10.631
Hi, Grace. Please call me
when you hear this message.

01:19:10.707 --> 01:19:12.698
Nothing really urgent, but...

01:19:13.009 --> 01:19:14.533
...we haven't spoken--

01:19:14.611 --> 01:19:17.671
- Congratulations, Vice-President!
- Congratulations!

01:19:17.781 --> 01:19:19.976
Your promotion is official!

01:19:21.918 --> 01:19:24.318
My family's from the Hunan Province.

01:19:24.387 --> 01:19:27.652
After the war,
my husband and I moved to Shanghai.

01:19:27.724 --> 01:19:32.252
There was a Tong De girls' school
in Shanghai. We lived behind that alley.

01:19:32.329 --> 01:19:34.797
My husband also loved to cook.

01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:37.261
He was just very unlucky.

01:19:37.434 --> 01:19:40.460
After we came to Taiwan,
he got stomach cancer and passed away.

01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:48.136
I also had to fight tooth and nail
to bring up my children alone.

01:19:48.211 --> 01:19:49.940
It's not easy, Mr. Chu.

01:19:50.013 --> 01:19:53.744
And look at them now.
Their wings grow stronger and stronger.

01:19:53.817 --> 01:19:55.341
They do as they please.

01:19:55.418 --> 01:19:58.546
They could care less about you.
It's so not worth it.

01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:14.000
That's it.

01:20:15.172 --> 01:20:17.834
I'll translate it first thing tomorrow.

01:20:18.175 --> 01:20:20.541
And then you're off to negotiate?

01:20:20.944 --> 01:20:22.707
Probably in a couple of weeks.

01:20:22.779 --> 01:20:26.977
I'll be in the States for a few days,
then here, and finally to Sydney.

01:20:27.317 --> 01:20:30.718
I requested that you take
a few days off to come with me.

01:20:30.987 --> 01:20:32.511
I'll need you.

01:20:32.856 --> 01:20:34.915
You'll do fine by yourself.

01:20:35.091 --> 01:20:37.821
Frankly, with your promotion now...

01:20:38.361 --> 01:20:40.420
...it's really your decision.

01:20:40.497 --> 01:20:43.466
You're my boss, technically speaking.

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:46.095
Wrong. I am your boss, period.

01:20:46.937 --> 01:20:48.802
Yes, "boss."

01:21:16.766 --> 01:21:18.131
What is it?

01:21:19.035 --> 01:21:21.868
- Don't you know who I am?
- No.

01:21:23.006 --> 01:21:26.840
- Call me Chu Jia-Chien.
- Okay, whatever you like.

01:21:27.777 --> 01:21:30.302
Call me Chu Jia-Chien!

01:21:40.357 --> 01:21:43.554
Have you completely erased
my older sister from your memory?

01:21:43.627 --> 01:21:45.026
Your older sister?

01:21:45.195 --> 01:21:47.686
That's right. My older sister.

01:21:49.065 --> 01:21:51.363
Chu Jia-Jen is my older sister.

01:21:51.768 --> 01:21:55.431
It's only been nine years
since your romance with her in college.

01:21:55.505 --> 01:21:58.770
She's still living in the past
and refusing to marry another!

01:21:58.842 --> 01:22:01.868
- You've completely forgotten her!
- Chu Jia-Jen?

01:22:01.945 --> 01:22:03.606
Now you remember?

01:22:04.514 --> 01:22:08.211
I don't remember this person,
but I've heard that name before.

01:22:08.385 --> 01:22:09.750
"Heard"?

01:22:11.588 --> 01:22:13.647
But I really can't remember.

01:22:14.524 --> 01:22:16.287
Are you just pretending?

01:22:16.359 --> 01:22:19.021
If you feel embarrassed, then forget it.

01:22:19.162 --> 01:22:21.426
There must be
some sort of misunderstanding.

01:22:21.498 --> 01:22:25.628
I wouldn't deny it if I really knew her,
whether she was your sister or not.

01:22:25.702 --> 01:22:29.160
- I need more information.
- The Chemistry Department at Chen-Kong.

01:22:29.239 --> 01:22:31.730
- What else do you need?
- That's impossible.

01:22:31.808 --> 01:22:35.335
There weren't many female students
in the Chemistry Department.

01:22:35.412 --> 01:22:38.506
- What's she like?
- She was your girlfriend!

01:22:38.581 --> 01:22:42.073
She gave you her first kiss!
I don't know what else to tell you!

01:22:42.152 --> 01:22:44.518
No, she wasn't my girlfriend.

01:22:45.889 --> 01:22:48.722
She wasn't even in my class. Now I recall.

01:22:49.659 --> 01:22:52.685
We were in the same department,
but not the same class.

01:22:52.762 --> 01:22:54.787
I think she hung out with Jin-Feng.

01:22:54.864 --> 01:22:56.525
You know Jin-Feng?

01:22:57.167 --> 01:23:00.625
She was my girlfriend!
We broke up after graduation.

01:23:01.371 --> 01:23:04.363
She married an American guy
before I left for the States.

01:23:04.441 --> 01:23:06.966
I saw her once in Chicago last year.

01:23:07.377 --> 01:23:08.844
Now I know.

01:23:09.746 --> 01:23:13.910
She often spoke of her best friend.
That must have been Chu Jia-Jen.

01:23:15.285 --> 01:23:16.946
Are you all right?

01:23:17.287 --> 01:23:20.256
You mean, she made it all up!

01:23:21.024 --> 01:23:23.584
- You're lying.
- Why would I lie to you?

01:23:25.328 --> 01:23:27.193
How did this happen?

01:23:27.263 --> 01:23:29.390
She made the whole story up.

01:23:37.907 --> 01:23:39.431
Please be home.

01:23:41.611 --> 01:23:43.772
Raymond, so glad you're home.

01:23:43.847 --> 01:23:47.078
- I just heard an absurd story.
- Raymond, who is it?

01:23:47.283 --> 01:23:48.648
No one!

01:23:51.955 --> 01:23:53.547
I'm in a little....

01:23:54.391 --> 01:23:56.154
Oh, I understand.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.260
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:24:09.439 --> 01:24:11.373
Welcome back, Chef Wen!

01:24:14.911 --> 01:24:17.675
Stop kissing up. Back to work, you fools!

01:24:18.982 --> 01:24:21.007
- Chef Wen--
- Just a second!

01:24:43.039 --> 01:24:44.301
Chef Wen?

01:25:07.564 --> 01:25:09.327
Where have you been?

01:25:13.603 --> 01:25:15.662
Uncle Wen passed away.

01:25:44.534 --> 01:25:46.263
B, South, 7204.

01:25:48.204 --> 01:25:50.035
Should be around here.

01:26:45.762 --> 01:26:47.389
I don't want tea.

01:26:48.031 --> 01:26:49.498
I want water.

01:26:50.099 --> 01:26:54.229
Drink it, Dad. It's your favorite
mountain tea. You'll feel better.

01:26:54.537 --> 01:26:56.437
My taste buds are gone.

01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:58.464
I prefer water.

01:28:43.112 --> 01:28:45.342
Why is she dressed like that?

01:28:48.851 --> 01:28:50.978
I love you, Teacher Chu!

01:29:45.241 --> 01:29:47.141
Can a single hand clap?

01:29:47.477 --> 01:29:49.775
Even a ballplayer needs an opponent!

01:29:49.846 --> 01:29:52.974
Why do I only get to talk
to thin air about love?

01:29:53.449 --> 01:29:57.510
Who's been writing these letters to me?
If you have guts, step up!

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.686
Who's been putting disgusting letters
on my desk every day? Who?

01:30:02.692 --> 01:30:05.058
Why hide if you had the guts
to write them?

01:30:05.328 --> 01:30:06.886
I'm not gonna let this go!

01:30:06.963 --> 01:30:09.693
I'll post the letters
to check the handwriting!

01:30:09.766 --> 01:30:12.826
I'll see where you can hide!
Go ahead and hide!

01:30:27.650 --> 01:30:29.174
What happened?

01:30:29.786 --> 01:30:33.244
Teacher said she'd forgive us
for writing the letters.

01:30:36.459 --> 01:30:38.654
You guys really went too far.

01:30:51.374 --> 01:30:54.002
The outing has been changed to next week.

01:30:54.076 --> 01:30:55.805
Will you be coming?

01:30:56.279 --> 01:30:58.975
Here's what I'll do, I'll sign you up for now.

01:30:59.048 --> 01:31:01.846
If you're busy, then let me know later.

01:31:09.992 --> 01:31:13.553
I'm sorry those jerks
hurt your feelings this way.

01:31:39.055 --> 01:31:41.353
I'm sorry about the other night.

01:31:41.424 --> 01:31:43.722
It was just a really confusing experience.

01:31:43.793 --> 01:31:47.661
My mind was blank. Besides you,
I didn't know where else to go.

01:31:47.797 --> 01:31:50.891
It's all right.
I should be the one apologizing.

01:31:50.967 --> 01:31:53.435
Why should you be sorry? It's your life.

01:31:53.503 --> 01:31:56.870
In any case,
I've made some decisions about my future.

01:31:57.206 --> 01:32:01.267
I want to go someplace where
no one knows me to get a fresh start.

01:32:01.477 --> 01:32:04.071
I knew you could take care of yourself.

01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:07.081
I also have a decision to announce
about my future.

01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:08.707
What decision?

01:32:09.452 --> 01:32:12.250
You know I'm not the type to settle down.

01:32:13.089 --> 01:32:17.253
I'm still not sure about this.
Nevertheless, it's been....

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.787
Remember Sophia?

01:32:21.163 --> 01:32:24.599
No? I'm sure I've mentioned her name
to you a few times.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.792
Nothing serious in the beginning, until....

01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:29.770
You're getting married?

01:32:31.374 --> 01:32:35.310
I would have told you about it sooner,
but it was all so sudden.

01:32:35.811 --> 01:32:38.041
She's really changed my life.

01:32:38.114 --> 01:32:40.548
Maybe she'll also change my future.

01:32:41.284 --> 01:32:43.809
It sounds more absurd than your story.

01:32:43.886 --> 01:32:47.151
- I didn't know how you'd take it.
- Congratulations!

01:32:49.425 --> 01:32:51.393
I knew you'd understand.

01:32:51.861 --> 01:32:54.955
And I know you'll really like
and admire Sophia.

01:32:55.197 --> 01:32:57.392
She's quite a painter, a teacher...

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.760
...and she's also managing my gallery.

01:33:01.103 --> 01:33:03.003
And she's a great cook.

01:33:04.307 --> 01:33:08.744
But you know, this marriage is not
going to change my current lifestyle.

01:33:09.412 --> 01:33:12.313
She's moving into my apartment
this weekend.

01:33:13.749 --> 01:33:17.276
Pretty much the same place,
same job and the same life.

01:33:18.454 --> 01:33:19.785
Of course.

01:33:22.925 --> 01:33:24.893
It's 2:00 already.

01:33:25.227 --> 01:33:27.855
- I'd better be going.
- To where? I'll take you.

01:33:27.930 --> 01:33:29.192
I'm fine.

01:33:31.767 --> 01:33:34.429
Actually, I've got two hours to spare.

01:33:35.438 --> 01:33:39.932
Will we be continuing
with our "friendship" status like before?

01:33:41.577 --> 01:33:44.375
I mean,
you do know about the office in the back.

01:33:46.148 --> 01:33:48.343
Sorry. I should go now.

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.617
Let's keep in touch.

01:34:18.742 --> 01:34:21.472
Please think about it some more,
Master Chu.

01:34:21.544 --> 01:34:24.308
The restaurant really needs your presence.

01:34:24.481 --> 01:34:27.939
With so many good young chefs,
you can easily find someone.

01:34:28.051 --> 01:34:32.420
But none with the expertise
in the art of Chinese cuisine like you.

01:34:32.989 --> 01:34:36.789
Just your presence there would be
a living, treasured cookbook.

01:34:37.794 --> 01:34:41.423
Do I just stand in the kitchen
until I rest in peace, like Old Wen?

01:34:41.498 --> 01:34:44.831
It's been said,
"People die for money. Birds die for food."

01:34:45.034 --> 01:34:47.764
To die for money is a man's business...

01:34:48.071 --> 01:34:51.837
...but to die for food?
That's for the birds. Is it worth it?

01:34:52.008 --> 01:34:56.240
There's truth to the saying. But your life
has been devoted to the art of cooking.

01:34:56.312 --> 01:34:58.542
What a pity to just let it go.

01:34:58.882 --> 01:35:00.975
People today are so insensitive.

01:35:01.050 --> 01:35:04.178
They can't appreciate
the art of exquisite dining.

01:35:04.487 --> 01:35:07.786
Chinese cuisine has traveled
to Taiwan for 40 years.

01:35:07.924 --> 01:35:11.724
And just like the rivers
that eventually flow into the sea...

01:35:12.028 --> 01:35:14.258
...it's all the same in the end.

01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:18.027
Even a mess of slop can pass for
"Joy Luck Dragon Phoenix."

01:35:18.101 --> 01:35:19.864
What more can I say?

01:35:20.670 --> 01:35:22.228
What is "pity"?

01:35:23.306 --> 01:35:26.969
Only when a heart feels dissatisfied
can it feel pity.

01:35:27.243 --> 01:35:31.942
Fortunately, I don't plan on wasting
my whole life on this stuff.

01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:34.947
Miss Chu.

01:35:35.118 --> 01:35:38.315
Please help me to convince your father
not to retire.

01:35:38.488 --> 01:35:40.581
Dad, you plan on retiring?

01:35:42.725 --> 01:35:45.990
It's his own business.
He can make his own decision.

01:35:56.806 --> 01:36:00.537
Master Chu, are you thinking of
opening your own restaurant?

01:36:02.145 --> 01:36:04.909
Be sure to let me know. I'll follow you.

01:36:09.719 --> 01:36:13.746
I see that Mr. Chu worries a lot
about his daughters.

01:36:14.791 --> 01:36:18.693
- Isn't that parenting?
- It's harder for a single man.

01:36:19.529 --> 01:36:21.360
It's been so many years.

01:36:21.431 --> 01:36:23.296
When did Mrs. Chu die?

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.599
When Jia-Ning was 4 years old,
about 16 years ago.

01:36:27.904 --> 01:36:30.202
A widower usually has a short life.

01:36:30.273 --> 01:36:32.138
Why didn't he remarry?

01:36:32.775 --> 01:36:35.039
Maybe because of the children.

01:36:36.279 --> 01:36:39.840
He needs to wise up.
He's raising his daughters for others.

01:36:39.916 --> 01:36:42.476
Only the ones nobody wants
end up with you.

01:36:42.552 --> 01:36:46.147
If you were so wise, you wouldn't be
haranguing over my divorce.

01:36:46.256 --> 01:36:48.986
And you shouldn't blame Jin-Feng either.

01:36:49.192 --> 01:36:51.387
What do you think of Mr. Chu?

01:36:51.628 --> 01:36:53.152
What about him?

01:36:53.663 --> 01:36:56.655
He seems like a nice person
and a great cook.

01:36:56.933 --> 01:36:58.833
He doesn't talk much...

01:36:59.135 --> 01:37:00.966
...but we really connect.

01:37:45.415 --> 01:37:48.009
I have a little announcement to make.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.985
You know, just like Jia-Ning, I....

01:37:54.557 --> 01:37:57.117
- You're pregnant?
- Nonsense! Of course not!

01:37:57.193 --> 01:37:58.387
But....

01:38:00.263 --> 01:38:01.924
It's just that....

01:38:05.568 --> 01:38:07.297
We just couldn't wait....

01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:08.564
He wants to....

01:38:08.638 --> 01:38:10.105
But I'm a Christian....

01:38:10.173 --> 01:38:13.006
We asked the priest to marry us
this morning.

01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:17.571
Hold on! He's waiting outside right now.
One second!

01:38:28.057 --> 01:38:29.888
Come in! Come in.

01:38:36.165 --> 01:38:39.362
Dad, Jia-Chien,
this is my husband, Chou Ming-Dao.

01:38:40.336 --> 01:38:41.360
Hi.

01:39:39.429 --> 01:39:40.760
Jia-Chien!

01:39:42.699 --> 01:39:45.293
- You scared me.
- You're gonna be late.

01:39:59.449 --> 01:40:02.179
- What are you doing?
- Packing Jia-Jen's things.

01:40:02.251 --> 01:40:04.378
- Let me help you.
- I'm okay.

01:40:09.025 --> 01:40:11.619
I loved this room when I was a child.

01:40:12.095 --> 01:40:15.030
When your mom wanted
some peace and quiet...

01:40:15.898 --> 01:40:18.298
...she also liked being in this room.

01:40:18.367 --> 01:40:22.531
Mrs. Liang says this room
is airy and has plenty of light...

01:40:22.939 --> 01:40:26.534
...and it would be the perfect place
for an exercise bike.

01:40:26.909 --> 01:40:28.274
Mrs. Liang?

01:40:29.278 --> 01:40:33.374
I went to Jin-Rong's place last night
and told them Jia-Jen's news.

01:40:34.517 --> 01:40:37.577
I'm running late.
I'll be back early from work.

01:40:39.856 --> 01:40:42.689
Don't move any more stuff until I get back.

01:40:50.199 --> 01:40:51.791
Let me tell you...

01:40:51.868 --> 01:40:55.804
...kids are creditors collecting
for the sins of our past lives.

01:40:55.872 --> 01:40:59.137
They know no compassion.
It's better off not having any.

01:40:59.208 --> 01:41:02.268
"Life is a boundless sea.
Only returning to shore is happiness."

01:41:02.345 --> 01:41:04.108
Marriage is a source of sin.

01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:08.207
A series of worries, disappointments,
misery, conflict and ingratitude.

01:41:08.284 --> 01:41:12.084
I tell you, every family has a book
of unspeakable problems.

01:41:14.123 --> 01:41:16.284
I have a cause for celebration!

01:41:16.359 --> 01:41:19.988
Jin-Rong's divorce decree came through.
I should have it framed.

01:41:20.062 --> 01:41:22.963
I want her to remember
her mother's words forever.

01:41:23.032 --> 01:41:25.967
I warned her not to marry that bastard!

01:41:26.035 --> 01:41:30.495
I'll have this divorce decree framed
and hung on the bathroom wall.

01:41:32.742 --> 01:41:34.869
You shouldn't worry so much.

01:41:35.077 --> 01:41:37.341
Whatever will be, will be.

01:41:37.713 --> 01:41:42.377
Instead of thinking about those creditors,
why not think more about yourself?

01:42:10.246 --> 01:42:12.441
Be careful. Watch your step.

01:42:16.185 --> 01:42:18.346
Dad's really willing to give the vase to me?

01:42:18.421 --> 01:42:22.289
Not really.
But if you don't take it, Mrs. Liang will.

01:42:22.825 --> 01:42:26.283
- What do you mean?
- She's been here almost every night.

01:42:27.029 --> 01:42:28.553
You're kidding.

01:42:29.599 --> 01:42:31.999
I decided not to go to Amsterdam.

01:42:35.104 --> 01:42:38.301
- Are you okay? Be careful.
- No problem.

01:42:41.444 --> 01:42:44.641
He's not Christian.
Why did you agree to marry him?

01:42:44.714 --> 01:42:46.113
He will be.

01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:51.881
- Welcome. Table for one?
- I'm meeting someone.

01:42:51.954 --> 01:42:53.717
Sure, help yourself.

01:43:00.997 --> 01:43:04.023
Thanks for coming.
I thought you might not show up.

01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:05.328
Why not?

01:43:05.835 --> 01:43:07.359
The other night....

01:43:07.536 --> 01:43:10.437
- What kind of tea would you like?
- What are you having?

01:43:10.506 --> 01:43:12.599
- Mountain tea.
- Same for me.

01:43:12.708 --> 01:43:14.039
Thank you.

01:43:21.651 --> 01:43:25.018
You know,
I understand what you're going through...

01:43:25.655 --> 01:43:29.147
- ...although I can't really explain it.
- Neither can I.

01:43:29.525 --> 01:43:32.426
It's complicated, but I can understand that.

01:43:33.729 --> 01:43:34.923
Thanks.

01:43:40.102 --> 01:43:43.697
I heard that you turned down
your promotion. Everyone's shocked.

01:43:43.773 --> 01:43:46.003
I hope I wasn't a factor.

01:43:46.809 --> 01:43:48.208
Not at all.

01:43:48.544 --> 01:43:50.671
Well, maybe only a tiny bit.

01:43:52.181 --> 01:43:56.140
I don't know. It's a whole series of things.
A family wedding...

01:43:56.385 --> 01:43:59.616
...actually, two marriages,
and someone passed away.

01:43:59.889 --> 01:44:02.084
And a really bad investment.

01:44:03.225 --> 01:44:07.025
All of a sudden, everything's gone.
Plus my father's health.

01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:09.720
So I've decided
to stay with him for a while.

01:44:09.799 --> 01:44:11.562
I think he needs me.

01:44:16.472 --> 01:44:19.669
The chief asked me
to try to change your mind.

01:44:19.742 --> 01:44:22.233
But what the hell? It's just a job.

01:44:27.016 --> 01:44:28.745
I'm glad, you know?

01:44:29.785 --> 01:44:30.877
Glad?

01:44:31.354 --> 01:44:35.085
That we didn't make love.
Not that I still wouldn't want to.

01:44:36.759 --> 01:44:39.523
But seeing you like this makes me happy.

01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:42.119
I'm happy, too.

01:44:43.666 --> 01:44:46.567
I think that we can be really good friends.

01:44:47.970 --> 01:44:49.062
Sure.

01:44:50.339 --> 01:44:52.330
Then, good friends?

01:44:56.379 --> 01:44:57.869
Good friends.

01:45:06.222 --> 01:45:10.659
When you were a baby, I'd spin this
for hours. You wouldn't let me stop.

01:45:11.627 --> 01:45:14.790
Well, please stop now.
I'm getting nauseous again.

01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:19.099
And I should go.

01:45:19.168 --> 01:45:21.762
I told Dad I'd help shop
for Sunday's dinner.

01:45:21.837 --> 01:45:25.933
Why did Dad send formal invitations?
Is it for Guo-Lun and Ming-Dao?

01:45:26.008 --> 01:45:29.375
He said he has his own
"little announcement" to make.

01:45:29.845 --> 01:45:31.938
- Mrs. Liang?
- Probably.

01:45:33.315 --> 01:45:37.376
I think, unlike you and Guo-Lun,
they won't rush their engagement.

01:45:37.453 --> 01:45:40.684
So hopefully,
he'll have enough time to think it over...

01:45:40.756 --> 01:45:42.781
...and realize what a nightmare she is.

01:45:42.858 --> 01:45:46.726
But I don't think he will fully recover
from the shock of recent events.

01:45:46.796 --> 01:45:49.196
Had I known he'd go crazy,
I wouldn't have....

01:45:49.265 --> 01:45:51.062
Don't blame yourself.

01:45:51.333 --> 01:45:54.496
He's not going crazy. He's an old horse.

01:45:55.004 --> 01:45:56.995
Horses don't get married.

01:46:29.705 --> 01:46:31.366
What do you think?

01:46:42.651 --> 01:46:46.712
Don't just run around!
One of you chase it, and the other grab it!

01:46:47.256 --> 01:46:49.019
Over here, Ming-Dao!

01:46:53.762 --> 01:46:54.956
Got it!

01:47:06.809 --> 01:47:09.107
- Jin-Rong, Mrs. Liang.
- Grandpa Chu!

01:47:09.178 --> 01:47:12.375
A tie for your father
and a bottle of good wine.

01:47:12.681 --> 01:47:15.206
- Also for your father.
- You shouldn't have.

01:47:15.284 --> 01:47:17.912
I should've been here earlier to help.

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.480
Fine.

01:47:20.756 --> 01:47:23.987
- I hope we're not intruding.
- No, not at all.

01:47:25.561 --> 01:47:28.530
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

01:47:29.899 --> 01:47:31.389
Come, a toast.

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:33.429
Cheers.

01:47:38.374 --> 01:47:40.274
Please help yourselves.

01:47:40.609 --> 01:47:42.941
Everyone, please help yourself.

01:47:48.384 --> 01:47:50.614
- Are you moving abroad?
- Not anymore.

01:47:50.719 --> 01:47:52.380
Mom, what's this?

01:47:55.024 --> 01:47:56.924
Do you want some shrimp?

01:47:58.827 --> 01:48:01.352
It's a simple meal. Please help yourselves.

01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:03.830
Mr. Chu, you've prepared too much.

01:48:04.033 --> 01:48:05.660
Help yourselves.

01:48:06.335 --> 01:48:07.802
Winter melon soup.

01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:11.806
Today's Red Seven Star Fish was too big.
They're best at 2 pounds.

01:48:11.874 --> 01:48:13.171
Listen to yourself.

01:48:13.242 --> 01:48:17.178
So picky already. You'll never find
a husband when you grow up.

01:48:19.515 --> 01:48:21.107
You girls are lucky.

01:48:21.183 --> 01:48:24.118
Your father's a great cook.
Look at this wonderful cuisine.

01:48:24.186 --> 01:48:27.212
Looks, smells and tastes good.
It's all here.

01:48:34.063 --> 01:48:35.428
Jia-Jen...

01:48:37.099 --> 01:48:38.964
...you two, bottoms up.

01:48:42.171 --> 01:48:44.605
Jia-Ning, you two, bottoms up.

01:48:49.278 --> 01:48:52.042
- Don't drink too much.
- I'm fine.

01:48:53.582 --> 01:48:54.981
Jia-Chien...

01:48:56.085 --> 01:48:57.450
...bottoms up!

01:49:26.315 --> 01:49:30.251
Fate has brought us to this table tonight.

01:49:30.319 --> 01:49:31.513
That's right.

01:49:31.587 --> 01:49:34.021
Although we're not actually related...

01:49:34.089 --> 01:49:36.489
...we're still considered family.

01:49:38.494 --> 01:49:40.860
And since we're one big family...

01:49:40.929 --> 01:49:43.830
...there's really nothing
we can't say to each other.

01:49:43.899 --> 01:49:47.027
I've kept this inside me for a long time.

01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:51.433
It wasn't as if I was trying to hide
any secrets from you.

01:49:51.974 --> 01:49:55.171
I just feel that I shouldn't allow
my personal affairs...

01:49:55.244 --> 01:49:58.509
...to be the family's worry
and, thus, become a burden.

01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:01.310
As a family, living under the same roof...

01:50:01.650 --> 01:50:04.118
...we can still live separate lives.

01:50:04.186 --> 01:50:08.714
This worry that we have for each other
is what makes us a family.

01:50:09.291 --> 01:50:11.885
I've done nothing wrong by not telling.

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:14.588
By telling, I can end this lingering.

01:50:14.897 --> 01:50:18.264
I cannot live my life
like my methods of cooking.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:22.263
I can't wait until all the ingredients
are prepared and then cook.

01:50:22.338 --> 01:50:25.899
Of course, after the first bite,
whether it's sour, sweet or spicy...

01:50:25.974 --> 01:50:28.534
...it's totally up to the individual.

01:50:29.812 --> 01:50:32.246
That's it for now. I'll continue after dinner.

01:50:32.314 --> 01:50:35.408
- Dad, what are you trying to say?
- We already knew.

01:50:35.484 --> 01:50:37.475
- You do?
- Let Dad tell us.

01:50:37.553 --> 01:50:40.716
Go ahead and say it.
The dishes are getting cold.

01:50:40.856 --> 01:50:42.050
So be it!

01:50:42.124 --> 01:50:45.389
Since the situation has come this far,
I'll say it.

01:50:46.829 --> 01:50:50.526
To me,
this house contains several old memories.

01:50:51.633 --> 01:50:55.194
But now, it's so empty,
and almost everyone has left.

01:50:55.738 --> 01:50:57.467
I've decided to sell it.

01:50:57.539 --> 01:51:00.235
I found a really nice place on Kum Dao.

01:51:01.276 --> 01:51:04.245
It's a bit old
and may require some remodeling.

01:51:04.313 --> 01:51:06.213
But it's a great place.

01:51:06.315 --> 01:51:08.476
It should be ready in a few months.

01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:11.280
Great. It's always nice
to move to a new place.

01:51:11.353 --> 01:51:13.844
New people, new house, new life.

01:51:14.356 --> 01:51:15.516
Great.

01:51:16.859 --> 01:51:18.884
I'll make a toast to you...

01:51:19.795 --> 01:51:21.422
...Auntie Liang.

01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:23.998
I haven't taken care of Jin-Rong...

01:51:24.266 --> 01:51:26.564
...but I can swear to Heaven...

01:51:26.635 --> 01:51:29.229
...as long as I, Old Chu,
have one last breath...

01:51:29.304 --> 01:51:32.899
...I’ll see that they both
shall never go cold or hungry...

01:51:32.975 --> 01:51:36.001
...and that you're always welcome
in our new home.

01:51:36.745 --> 01:51:38.007
Take a look.

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:42.915
This is a medical report I had done
at the Veteran's Hospital last month.

01:51:43.352 --> 01:51:45.912
Please, Auntie, we ask for your approval.

01:51:46.088 --> 01:51:48.079
I'll first drink a toast.

01:51:50.492 --> 01:51:51.686
Cheers!

01:51:52.261 --> 01:51:54.422
Dad, you should stop drinking.

01:51:54.496 --> 01:51:57.021
- You're getting drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

01:51:58.467 --> 01:51:59.729
Jin-Rong.

01:52:03.205 --> 01:52:06.436
Uncle Chu and I have been planning
for a long time.

01:52:06.742 --> 01:52:11.008
But because of this terrible divorce,
our love was a secret until now.

01:52:12.414 --> 01:52:14.905
Although love should be
between two people...

01:52:14.983 --> 01:52:17.383
...Uncle Chu loves all of you.

01:52:18.353 --> 01:52:20.184
And he loves Shan-Shan also.

01:52:20.255 --> 01:52:23.816
So he really wishes
for your approval and understanding.

01:52:24.993 --> 01:52:26.358
As for me...

01:52:27.296 --> 01:52:30.129
...I only hope to be with him at his side.

01:52:30.799 --> 01:52:32.460
I'm willing to be with him.

01:52:32.534 --> 01:52:34.502
That's enough! Don't say anymore.

01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:37.004
- Is there a mistake?
- Dad, are you crazy?

01:52:37.072 --> 01:52:40.007
I'm not crazy.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

01:52:42.177 --> 01:52:43.235
Mom?

01:52:45.747 --> 01:52:47.874
- Loosen her collar!
- Don't touch me!

01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:51.716
Keep your dirty hands off of me!
Damn you, Old Chu!

01:52:51.787 --> 01:52:54.278
- Help carry her to the sofa!
- Be careful!

01:52:54.356 --> 01:52:56.756
- Be careful!
- Damn you! Don't touch me!

01:52:56.825 --> 01:52:58.850
Take me home, Jin-Rong!

01:52:59.695 --> 01:53:04.689
Let me tell you, don't even think about it
for as long as I still have my last breath.

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.428
- Let's go, Shan-Shan.
- Mom, calm down.

01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:10.129
- Let's take her home.
- Okay, okay.

01:53:10.205 --> 01:53:12.105
What kind of world is this?

01:53:12.174 --> 01:53:13.664
I want to die!

01:53:14.009 --> 01:53:16.807
- What kind of family is this?
- Be careful!

01:53:17.312 --> 01:53:19.007
I'll take Shan-Shan.

01:53:22.251 --> 01:53:24.981
God won't let you get away with this!

01:53:26.388 --> 01:53:28.583
I want to go back to America!

01:54:21.443 --> 01:54:22.603
Hello?

01:54:22.844 --> 01:54:24.937
Guo-Lun, how are you?

01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:26.404
Fine.

01:54:26.548 --> 01:54:30.541
But we've been up all night.
I don't have the heart to wake them.

01:54:30.752 --> 01:54:33.152
Don't wake them. Get some sleep.

01:54:33.422 --> 01:54:36.949
I'll be back again in a few months.
I'll come visit then.

01:54:37.526 --> 01:54:41.053
Bye, then. Tell us all about Amsterdam
when you come back.

01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:44.160
And thanks for your help
these past months.

01:54:44.566 --> 01:54:46.261
Take care of your wife and kid.

01:54:46.401 --> 01:54:47.766
Of course.

01:54:48.036 --> 01:54:50.231
Say hello to Jia-Jen and Ming-Dao for us.

01:54:50.439 --> 01:54:54.500
They can't make it either.
They've got a big day today themselves.

01:54:55.811 --> 01:54:56.800
Bye.

01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:08.548
Do you believe that Jesus Christ
has forgiven your sins...

01:55:08.624 --> 01:55:11.149
- ...and made you a new person?
- Yes.

01:55:11.393 --> 01:55:15.693
Do you believe in following Jesus Christ
unto eternity and never regret?

01:55:16.231 --> 01:55:17.255
Yes.

01:55:17.332 --> 01:55:20.096
Believe in your heart.
Say "yes" from your mouth:

01:55:20.369 --> 01:55:23.361
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit...

01:55:23.438 --> 01:55:25.406
...I baptize you. Amen.

01:55:58.073 --> 01:55:59.836
How are you feeling?

01:56:00.575 --> 01:56:02.770
Fine. Just a small headache.

01:56:03.612 --> 01:56:06.103
- You should get going.
- All right.

01:56:06.715 --> 01:56:10.412
I'll pick up Shan-Shan on my return.
Get some rest at home.

01:56:10.485 --> 01:56:11.577
Sure.

01:56:25.567 --> 01:56:26.932
I love you.

01:56:55.897 --> 01:56:57.125
SOLD

01:57:22.124 --> 01:57:24.115
- Hi.
- Hi. Please come in.

01:57:25.293 --> 01:57:27.227
You'll be the only one here tonight.

01:57:27.295 --> 01:57:30.287
Everyone else called to apologize,
because they had plans.

01:57:30.365 --> 01:57:34.597
- Where's Shan-Shan and Jin-Rong?
- Jin-Rong's not feeling well today.

01:57:34.803 --> 01:57:37.033
Shan-Shan is with her grandma.

01:57:37.939 --> 01:57:40.874
No need to take off your shoes.
Just come in.

01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:45.368
- Did they tell you the ultrasound results?
- I don't want to know.

01:57:45.447 --> 01:57:46.778
Another daughter?

01:58:01.930 --> 01:58:04.455
Have a seat. Dinner's almost ready.

01:58:29.090 --> 01:58:31.820
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's delicious.

01:58:32.227 --> 01:58:33.888
- But....
- But what?

01:58:34.896 --> 01:58:38.593
You put too much ginger in the soup.
Its effect is ruined.

01:58:42.537 --> 01:58:44.198
Too much ginger?

01:58:44.306 --> 01:58:46.900
This is the same as Mother's recipe.

01:58:47.175 --> 01:58:49.473
I remember you
bickering about this back then.

01:58:49.544 --> 01:58:51.705
You're too timid with ginger.

01:58:51.913 --> 01:58:54.882
- It's just a comment.
- Don't boss me around the kitchen.

01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:57.817
I wasn't. It was a minor critique.

01:58:58.253 --> 01:58:59.777
The taste....

01:59:00.689 --> 01:59:02.020
Taste.

01:59:05.493 --> 01:59:07.358
What about the taste?

01:59:11.233 --> 01:59:12.632
Jia-Chien...

01:59:13.401 --> 01:59:16.063
- ...your soup....
- What about my soup?

01:59:26.114 --> 01:59:28.514
Your soup, Jia-Chien...

01:59:30.552 --> 01:59:32.247
...I can taste it.

01:59:33.722 --> 01:59:35.212
You can taste?

01:59:41.429 --> 01:59:42.953
I can taste it.

01:59:45.467 --> 01:59:46.866
Some more...

01:59:47.302 --> 01:59:48.633
...please.

02:00:00.015 --> 02:00:01.277
Daughter.

02:00:02.317 --> 02:00:03.511
Dad.
