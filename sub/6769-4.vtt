00:07.006 --> 00:08.550
(door opens)

00:14.347 --> 00:16.265
He hasn't called.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.144
Okay, that scared me.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.314
{\an1}Brandon's been in New York
for three days.

00:24.649 --> 00:25.942
His interview was yesterday.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.277
Did he say he'd call?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.865
Maybe it-it didn't go well,

00:31.948 --> 00:34.451
and he's just embarrassed.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.453
Or maybe it went great,

00:36.536 --> 00:38.788
and he's having
the time of his life.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.583
Or maybe he wants to call,
but doesn't know if he should.

00:41.666 --> 00:42.625
How'd you leave it?

00:42.709 --> 00:44.127
Doesn't really matter.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.171
{\an3}I hate

00:46.254 --> 00:47.672
being up in the middle
of the night.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.257
It's the worst, right?

00:49.340 --> 00:50.967
I'm pathetic.
What's your excuse?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.510
(giggles)

00:52.594 --> 00:55.305
Well, memorial service
for Noah's dad's tomorrow.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.682
He hasn't really said anything.
Do you think I should go?

00:57.766 --> 00:59.601
I don't even know
if he wants me to go.

00:59.684 --> 01:00.769
Do you want me to go?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.520
He's giving the eulogy.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.563
I'll take that as a yes.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.275
He'll be fine.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.276
Brandon's gonna call.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.695
Yeah.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.781
Want to watch TV?

01:12.864 --> 01:14.866
Yeah. Thought you'd never ask.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.997
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.999
I just don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:23.082 --> 01:25.001
Tomorrow,

01:25.084 --> 01:26.795
or the day after that...

01:26.878 --> 01:28.463
For the rest of my life.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.422
{\an1}Well...

01:29.506 --> 01:32.175
you could start
by pushing the "on" button.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.968
Thanks.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.470
{\an5}MAN (on TV):
Tomorrow's weather should
be more of the same.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.846
Look for a high of...

01:36.930 --> 01:38.431
{\an1}Now what?
Just relax.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.892
Check out your options.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.435
{\an1}Find

01:42.519 --> 01:44.187
something you like, go for it.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.814
What if I don't find anything
I like?

01:45.897 --> 01:47.023
You will.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.024
Sooner or later.

01:48.107 --> 01:50.151
Definitely will.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.170
Third night in a row.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.548
{\an3}What?
"What?"

02:11.631 --> 02:12.674
That you've left.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.217
Go back to sleep.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.552
We'll talk in the morning.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.345
I'm awake.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.600
It's nothing.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.935
{\an1}Really.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.019
{\an1}It's just

02:25.103 --> 02:27.230
we're moving pretty quick.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.147
And leaving at

02:28.231 --> 02:29.732
3:00 in the morning
slows things down?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.484
Yeah. A little.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.569
And that's the reason?

02:32.652 --> 02:34.571
That...

02:34.654 --> 02:36.656
and you snore like thunder.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.741
{\an3}How's

02:38.825 --> 02:40.243
the hunt for the
dorm room going?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.078
Uh, I talked to 'em last week.

02:42.161 --> 02:43.079
Still on the waiting list.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.998
Wow, must be a long list.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.416
They said something
will open up soon.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.709
Did they really?

02:47.792 --> 02:49.711
Yes, they really did.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.212
You know, I don't think
we're moving too quick.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.505
And I don't think you do either.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.718
If this is about Steve...

02:56.801 --> 02:57.468
If?

02:57.552 --> 02:58.595
I'm staying with him

02:58.678 --> 03:00.221
{\an1}because he offered me
a place to live.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.264
What if I did?

03:01.347 --> 03:02.515
Are you?

03:04.183 --> 03:06.144
I'm out of here.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.940

03:11.024 --> 03:13.234

03:38.718 --> 03:41.262

04:07.163 --> 04:09.415

04:15.213 --> 04:17.298

04:53.126 --> 04:56.921
I remember when I was pregnant
with our son...

05:00.174 --> 05:01.884
Daniel would talk to Noah.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.471
He said it was like speaking
through a curtain.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.807
That made him feel safe.

05:07.890 --> 05:11.769
I think it allowed him to...

05:11.853 --> 05:14.856
say what he felt in his heart.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.528
And he felt so much.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.782
More than you'll ever know.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.537
Thank you.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.250
Thank you, Mrs. Hunter.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.378
Our prayers are with you
and your family.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.463
Noah.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.507
I love you.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.305
(clearing throat)

05:49.182 --> 05:51.225
My father...

05:53.644 --> 05:55.646
My dad, um...

05:59.400 --> 06:01.611
Hell, look...

06:01.694 --> 06:05.615
my father always told me
when you're going on a trip...

06:05.698 --> 06:07.617
take all your clothes,
and all your money,

06:07.700 --> 06:10.745
and lay it out on the bed.

06:12.371 --> 06:15.375
And you talk half the clothes
and all the money.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.668
Daniel Hunter,

06:17.752 --> 06:20.797
1945 to 1998.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.801
CEO of Hunter Oil.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.890
Liked his martinis dry
with three olives.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.480
Noah. Noah.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.482
(minister speaks indistinctly)

06:39.565 --> 06:41.150
{\an3}Let him go.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.235
I can't.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.403
KELLY:
You have to.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.497
STEVE:
<i>Admit it.</i>

06:54.580 --> 06:55.289
It's good.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.541
It's okay.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.376
{\an3}SOPHIE:
It's a total find.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.585
{\an3}No one's ever heard
of the club.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.629
Well, I'm not saying that
we shouldn't run your article.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.005
It's-it's just not a column.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.841
{\an1}Well, then we'll call it
"Sophie's Scene."

07:04.924 --> 07:06.676
{\an1}"Sophie's Suggestion."
Yeah.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.010
"Sophie's..."
Something like that.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.013
{\an3}We'll run my review,
my picture and...

07:11.097 --> 07:12.682
Your picture?

07:12.765 --> 07:13.766
It's a good idea.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.227
{\an3}No, Steve, I think that
<i>this</i> is a great ide.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.271
{\an3}Well, at least Brandon
thinks so.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.189
What's that?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.482
A Web site.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.694
JANET: Mm-hmm. People will be
able to access articles online.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.070
So, we'll expand
our reader base,

07:26.154 --> 07:27.530
we'll more get more subscribers,

07:27.613 --> 07:28.948
more advertisers.
This is a good idea.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.867
{\an1}But for now,
what about this?

07:30.950 --> 07:33.327
{\an4}SOPHIE:
I think the Web site's
a great idea.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.579
Oh, do you?
Mm-hmm.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.706
Just not this one.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.542
How many hits have
you gotten so far?

07:39.625 --> 07:40.543
Well, it's only been a day.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.712
But after we register
with the search engines,

07:42.795 --> 07:44.213
and do a little promotion...

07:44.297 --> 07:45.548
{\an3}No, you know what
you need?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.341
One of those live
digital cameras.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.718
{\an1}So you can see
the entire newsroom.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.721
{\an3}You know, the hustle
and the bustle,

07:51.804 --> 07:54.807
copyboys copying,
editors editing.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.935
That kind of thing.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.937
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.023
That's happening.

08:02.106 --> 08:05.026
{\an1}I think the camera's
a great idea.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.028
Great.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.404
So about the column--

08:08.487 --> 08:09.780
{\an3}I'll get you a picture
right away.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.908
{\an3}Okay?

08:15.870 --> 08:17.580
You were on your honeymoon.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.207
{\an3}I wanted to hear
your voice.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.209
With my mother.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.585
God.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.420
I shouldn't have called,
I was wrong,

08:24.503 --> 08:26.505
but I miss you.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.091
You don't even know me.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.468
Here she comes.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.929
I kept thinking about Las Vegas.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.429
Forget about Las Vegas.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.222
It was a mistake.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.432
And if I can't?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.226
(elegant piano music plays)

08:38.308 --> 08:41.062
Ah, handsome, kind and polite.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.563
How did I ever get so lucky?

08:50.696 --> 08:52.406
I just wish
we would've found him.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.408
Just so I can know
he was okay.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.994
{\an3}He needs to be alone
right now.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.829
{\an1}Look at all this.
I have so much work,

08:58.913 --> 09:00.957
{\an1}and I can't imagine
doing any of it right now.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.416
{\an3}So don't.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.626
I have deadlines.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.002
Blow 'em off.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.420
{\an1}Customers depending
on me.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.047
Disappoint them.
I can't.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.257
{\an3}Why not?

09:09.340 --> 09:11.342
{\an1}I hate rhetorical
questions.

09:13.427 --> 09:16.305
You know, when we were
at the funeral,

09:16.389 --> 09:19.183
I was thinking about my life,

09:19.267 --> 09:22.311
{\an3}and then Noah got up and
he freaked out and ran off.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.939
And I realized
I have no problems.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.984
No deaths, no moments
that I can't get back.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.444
So you feel good knowing
he feels bad?

09:30.528 --> 09:32.446
No. I feel terribly for Noah.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.157
I mean, the regret
that he must feel

09:35.241 --> 09:37.660
for having missed out on all
that time with his dad.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.120
I can't imagine it,

09:39.203 --> 09:40.663
and I don't want to.

09:40.746 --> 09:41.956
{\an3}Last night,
you know,

09:42.039 --> 09:44.667
I was talking about I don't know
what I'm gonna do with my life.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.294
Well, now I do.
I'm gonna live it.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.461
That's good.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.214
You live it, I'm gonna work.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.507
Work later.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.675
{\an3}That's funny.
No,

09:52.758 --> 09:54.010
come on, we'll go for a walk,

09:54.093 --> 09:55.011
we'll get a cappuccino.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.137
I don't think so.

09:56.220 --> 09:56.679
It'll be fun.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.514
No. I... I said no.

09:58.597 --> 09:59.807
Donna.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.393
Sorry.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.186
{\an3}I'm just stressed
That is exactly why

10:04.270 --> 10:06.522
we are gonna change
and you're coming with me.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.321
It looks more like an eyeball
than a camera.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.325
It's an all-seeing eye,
that's the idea.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.038
{\an3}Okay, click on
beat cam.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.664
Oh, it works.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.207
DAVID:
Yeah?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.208
JANET:
Oh, the hustle

10:26.292 --> 10:27.376
and bustle of
the newsroom.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.211
Hey, not bad.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.379
I think it's awesome.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.589
Thank you.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.215
{\an3}It's only still
pictures.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.216
Yeah, that's
how it works.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.718
{\an1}It reloads every
few seconds,

10:35.801 --> 10:38.262
{\an1}but, see, with this JPEG
program that I have in here,

10:38.346 --> 10:39.889
{\an1}it's almost like watching
a time lapse movie

10:39.972 --> 10:41.265
{\an4}of the whole day.
JANET:
See Janet.

10:41.349 --> 10:45.603
{\an3}See Janet give Sophie her
article to rewrite.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.730
{\an1}You know, when
they give an Oscar

10:47.813 --> 10:49.732
for most boring film, you
better dust off that tux.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.150
{\an3}Thank you.

10:52.026 --> 10:52.943
{\an1}Steve?
Yeah?

10:53.027 --> 10:54.070
{\an1}You gave
Sophie a column?

10:54.153 --> 10:55.696
Yeah, weekly reviews.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.366
{\an3}The more she's near greatness,
the sooner she'll weaken.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.742
{\an1}You guys are living
together.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.911
Yeah, but she's always at
school or studying late.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.622
{\an3}This way, at least
I'll have a chance.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.917
Has it crossed your mind that
maybe she's just not interested?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.251
Mm-hmm, yep, yep.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.920
{\an1}And?

11:11.003 --> 11:14.882
{\an3}And I do 100 push-ups, 500
sit-ups and run three miles.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.469
{\an3}And then that thought
disappears.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.388
(computer beeps)

11:20.471 --> 11:22.223
Hey, B-cam got its first hit.
Well, reload.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.724
{\an3}Let's see what
they're looking at.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.811
DAVID:
Ta-da.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.398
JANET:
Hey, Sophie...

11:30.481 --> 11:32.650
you're blocking the hustle
and bustle of the newsroom.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.235
DAVID:
Janet, Sophie <i> is</i> the hustle

11:34.318 --> 11:36.362
and bustle of the newsroom.

11:39.657 --> 11:43.786
KELLY: The thing about Sophie
is, she just seems so carefree.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.288
Were we ever like that?

11:46.372 --> 11:49.166
{\an3}I think I have
a vague recollection.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.960
I envy that about her.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.504
Well, it certainly does
make her unpredictable.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.464
{\an1}Maybe that's a good
thing for Steve.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.175
{\an3}Steve? I thought she
was seeing David.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.512
What? No, the way he talks,
they're practically engaged.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.305
Oops, so much
for carefree.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.515
Did I say that about her?

12:04.598 --> 12:06.600
{\an3}Enviously.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.103
{\an1}And people say I'm a
good judge of character.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.313
(sighs) Well, I wish the
whole mess surprised me.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.481
But it's just so typical.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.067
I mean, you and Brandon,

12:15.151 --> 12:16.152
me and Noah.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.779
{\an1}Do you ever say to yourself
it's just not worth it?

12:18.863 --> 12:20.156
Kel?

12:20.239 --> 12:23.284
I want a cappuccino.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.953
What? You have
a cappuccino.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.289
I think I want another one.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.248
Huh?

12:29.331 --> 12:30.708
Oh! Ooh!

12:30.791 --> 12:32.668
MAN: We can eat outside.
That's cool. All right, great.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.305
DONNA: Oh, yeah, he's not gonna
see us standing here.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.308
Well, look inconspicuous.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.435
Sure, mm-hmm, we blend.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.191
Okay, gone, playtime's over.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.734
Back to work.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.112
We <i> are</i> at work.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.322
At least you are.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.615
What are you talking about?

13:02.698 --> 13:04.033
Your own boutique.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.493
"Fashions by Donna."

13:05.576 --> 13:07.870
Ha, you kidding?
All right.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.163
{\an1}We'd come up
with a different name.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.957
{\an3}Okay, sure, how about
"Not on your life"?

13:12.041 --> 13:14.210
Come on.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.212
(dialing phone)

13:16.295 --> 13:18.380
{\an3}(sighing):
God...

13:18.464 --> 13:19.757
Hello, hi.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.177
Yeah, you have a store
for lease on Robertson.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.887
We'd like to see it.
Mmm.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.723
(rock music playing)

13:34.647 --> 13:37.066
This is KVIB live
from the After Dark.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.567
{\an1}What's your name, and what
do you want to hear?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.277
Yeah, hi, it's Freddy.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.654
It's for Jenna.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.113
If you're listening,

13:43.197 --> 13:44.532
Rick's having this great party

13:44.615 --> 13:46.534
and I wanna take you.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.786
{\an1}Fred, my friend, the chances
that Jenna's listening

13:48.869 --> 13:50.746
are like zero, okay?

13:50.829 --> 13:52.456
What am I supposed to do?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.542
How about calling her?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.919
Girl doesn't even know my name.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.754
Okay, then how about
I call her for you?

13:58.837 --> 13:59.922
Dude, you wouldn't?!

14:00.005 --> 14:02.424
I shouldn't, but...

14:02.508 --> 14:04.760
lately it's all
I seem to be doing, so, uh,

14:04.843 --> 14:07.054
hold on a minute and I'll
get her number, okay?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.473
(rock music begins)

14:12.393 --> 14:14.478
Mom, what is it?

14:14.562 --> 14:16.480
You tell me. Carl left.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.232
He said I should ask you why.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.276
Left? Like as in, "go home"?

14:20.359 --> 14:22.278
{\an3}Yeah.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.489
Valerie, listen,

14:25.573 --> 14:27.157
he's getting an annulment.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.285
{\an1}Is there anything
I should know?

14:29.368 --> 14:30.452
I'm sorry.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.787
Anything at all?

14:31.870 --> 14:33.247
Don't lie to me, Valerie.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.624
Mom, the-the truth is... is...

14:36.709 --> 14:38.294
Carl's a jerk.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.296
You're way too good for him.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.340
You saw him at lunch. Did he
seem at all unhappy to you?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.426
No, he seemed extremely happy.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.304
I have no idea what happened.

14:48.387 --> 14:52.474
I thought he was the one.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.770
I thought that I...
was finally gonna be happy.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.814
I'm sorry.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.484
I just don't understand, honey.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.626
(police siren wails)

15:38.479 --> 15:40.856
{\an3}License and registration,
please.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.441
Um, sure.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.280
{\an3}I'm gonna need you to
step out of the car, sir.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.865
What'd I do?

15:49.948 --> 15:51.033
Driving erratically.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.201
Weaving.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.913
{\an3}And possession of an
open container.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.248
Step out of the car.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.875
{\an3}(sighs)
And to the curb.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.877
Why are you doing this?

16:01.960 --> 16:04.421
{\an3}Right up here
on the curb, please.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.048
That's good.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.217
If you'll turn around
and face me.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.386
Now if you'll count backwards
from 100, please.

16:10.469 --> 16:14.682
100, 99, 98, 96, 97.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.308
I can count, great.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.935
Now, if you'll recite
the alphabet for me.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.269
All right.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.312
A for attitude.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.231
B for badge.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.108
{\an3}(laughing):
C for cop.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.442
{\an1}What?
You're under arrest

16:25.526 --> 16:27.027
{\an1}for driving
under the influence.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.279
{\an3}I'm not even finished yet,
I'm still on D.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.574
You got Daniel,

16:32.658 --> 16:36.203
you got Dad.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.122
You got death, right?

16:38.205 --> 16:39.665
Huh?

16:39.748 --> 16:40.916
Step this way, please.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.549
(knocking on door)

16:51.719 --> 16:52.261
I made it.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.054
In print, my first column.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.764
Thank you, Steve.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.558
Congratulations.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.768
{\an3}I mean, I knew it was
coming out this morning,

16:59.852 --> 17:01.353
but to actually see it.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.439
{\an3}I can't wait
to send copies home.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.691
What do you expect me to say?

17:05.773 --> 17:08.277
Uh, let's see,
that you're happy for me?

17:08.359 --> 17:09.444
That you're impressed?

17:09.528 --> 17:11.280
{\an3}(clears throat)
Look, if this

17:11.363 --> 17:12.781
is about my
leaving last night,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.282
I have an explanation.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.744
{\an1}No, I'm sure
you have an excuse.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.913
I couldn't sleep;
I was too excited.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.790
I drove around to find
an open newsstand.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.791
Steve know this is the only
reason you're friends with him?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.711
Take that back.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.296
I wish I could.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.635
WOMAN:
<i>Standard lease,</i>

17:33.719 --> 17:35.471
three years.
Security: first and last.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.472
{\an1}DONNA:
Thanks.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.140
But we're just looking.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.142
{\an1}Give us till
the end of the day.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.769
I have two showings
tomorrow morning,

17:41.852 --> 17:44.813
so I need to know by 6:00
if I'm gonna cancel them.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.273
You got it, thanks.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.066
Thanks.
Thank you.

17:47.149 --> 17:51.028
{\an1}Have you completely
lost your mind?

17:51.111 --> 17:53.197
No, I have come to my senses.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.449
{\an3}Donna, trust me,
this feels really good.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.533
I know we can do this.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.827
We? Ha!
Yes, we.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.370
You and me, hi, partner.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.331
{\an1}Hi.
Hi.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.541
Hi.
Hello.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.584
Oh...

18:05.667 --> 18:07.503
Did I, uh, come at a bad time?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.129
No, no, come on in.
Not at all.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.547
{\an3}He's in. Mmm.
Oh.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.174
Uh, I'm Matt.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.968
I, uh, have an office upstairs.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.136
Donna, Kelly.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.179
Right. Hi.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.139
{\an1}Oh, I already said that,
didn't I?

18:19.223 --> 18:21.016
You guys, uh, renting
this space?

18:21.099 --> 18:22.184
{\an3}No. No. No.
(cell phone rings)

18:22.267 --> 18:23.185
{\an3}Ooh.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.020
{\an3}Excuse me for
a second.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.981
Yes.

18:28.065 --> 18:28.774
Maybe. A boutique.

18:28.857 --> 18:29.900
Well, if you're
thinking about,

18:29.983 --> 18:32.694
uh, fixing up the place,
I have a list of people for you.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.987
{\an3}I got an

18:34.071 --> 18:35.989
electrician, a carpenter,
locksmith.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.699
{\an6}What are you, a temp agent
or something?
No.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.701
No, no. An attorney, actually.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.703
{\an4}These guys are just
former clients.
Oh,

18:41.787 --> 18:43.747
you're nice
to give them referrals.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.540
Well, they're good people.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.333
And, besides,

18:46.416 --> 18:48.544
would be a hit
with their parole officers.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.920
Parole--

18:50.003 --> 18:51.505
{\an3}They're convicts?
Well,

18:51.588 --> 18:54.508
not anymore.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.510
Noah's been arrested.
What?

18:56.593 --> 18:57.886
What happened?
Drunk driving.

18:57.970 --> 18:58.929
{\an1}His arraignment's
in an hour.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.848
How did he sound?

19:00.931 --> 19:02.057
{\an3}I don't know.
It was Valerie.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.059
He called her.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.061
{\an1}Well, he was probably
just too upset

19:06.144 --> 19:07.729
{\an1}or embarrassed
to call you.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.565
{\an3}Yeah, I'm sure that's
the reason.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.025
Does he, uh, have an attorney?

19:12.109 --> 19:14.611
He does now.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.582
Stay away from me.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.916
{\an1}You're not returning
my calls.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.917
'Cause I hate you.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.087
{\an3}You didn't hate me
in Las Vegas.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.715
Because I slept with you?

19:34.798 --> 19:36.091
{\an1}Please.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.384
Hatred's a prerequisite.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.927
Abby is upset.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.929
And I'm sorry about that, but...

19:41.013 --> 19:42.931
you had a hand
in making that happen.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.474
And I thought sleeping
with my mother's husband

19:44.558 --> 19:45.392
would make her so happy.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.603
I will never forgive myself
for that.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.605
{\an3}The line forms to the left.
But...

19:49.688 --> 19:52.816
I did it thinking
we had something.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.778
You know, until pretty recently,

19:56.862 --> 19:59.114
I thought I was gonna die.

19:59.197 --> 20:02.117
I made a promise that I would
live my life decently.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.621
I find out that I'm okay, and I
go and I ruin my mother's life.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.081
{\an1}We don't have
anything, Carl.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.917
And you know what?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.169
You're incredibly lucky
we don't.

20:21.219 --> 20:22.471
You said so yourself.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.972
{\an1}No one's logging on
to the articles.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.307
{\an5}Not yet, but
they will.
Well, fine.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.309
{\an1}In the meantime,
they're loving the beat cam.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.394
And she is a columnist.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.106
Right, which is why
we gave her a desk

20:33.190 --> 20:34.650
{\an3}directly in front
of the camera,

20:34.733 --> 20:37.486
because she's
a columnist.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.863
{\an1}You're the one who wanted
to go online, okay?

20:39.947 --> 20:42.991
{\an1}I'm just adding a little...
salesmanship.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.995
{\an3}Put her in a wet T-shirt
and I'm out of here.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.875
{\an3}You're a sick,
sick man.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.002
(snorts)

20:56.046 --> 20:58.340
{\an1}Any ideas for column
number two?

20:58.423 --> 21:00.008
Yeah, actually.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.177
{\an3}Um, I was thinking of doing
something on David.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.054
{\an6}David?
You know his
radio show

21:04.137 --> 21:06.264
{\an3}is new, and I just thought it
could use the publicity.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.141
Yeah, sure. So could the club.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.059
So you're okay with the idea?

21:09.142 --> 21:09.893
It's your column.

21:09.977 --> 21:10.978
Steve.

21:11.061 --> 21:11.853
Fine.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.647
You know big a star
you're gonna be?

21:13.730 --> 21:15.148
{\an1}Huge.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.025
Huger than huge. You're gonna be

21:17.109 --> 21:19.111
like a-a supernova.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.409
(car horns honking)

21:28.954 --> 21:30.872
DONNA:
Noah?

21:30.956 --> 21:32.874
{\an4}Why didn't you
call me?
'Cause I felt like a jerk.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.251
This whole thing's stupid,
all right?

21:34.334 --> 21:36.294
Hi, Matt Durning.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.088
That's great.
Who are you?

21:38.171 --> 21:40.090
{\an3}Your lawyer.
I didn't hire one.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.925
{\an1}I did.
(gavel pounding)

21:42.009 --> 21:44.886
Next case: <i> The State</i>
<i>v. Noah Hunter.</i>

21:44.970 --> 21:46.722
The defendant will be held
to answer the charge

21:46.805 --> 21:48.724
of driving under the influence
of alcohol,

21:48.807 --> 21:50.726
and possession
of an open container.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.768
How do you plead?

21:51.852 --> 21:54.021
{\an1}Matt Durning, Your Honor,
I represent Mr. Hunter.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.939
{\an1}We haven't had time
to discuss the, uh...

21:56.023 --> 21:57.733
{\an3}Not guilty.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.901
JUDGE:
Case is set for tomorrow.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.903
2:00 sharp.
Drive safely.

22:01.987 --> 22:07.409
Next case-- number 3572249.
<i>The State v. Derrick Magnuson.</i>

22:08.493 --> 22:10.037
Are there any problems
with your car?

22:10.120 --> 22:11.913
With the steering
or the alignment?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.290
{\an3}No.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.000
That could account
for the impaired driving.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.251
Maybe your driving was perfect,

22:16.334 --> 22:18.378
so they had no right
to pull you over.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.588
{\an3}So, what you're
saying is,

22:19.671 --> 22:21.089
either way you
can argue it.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.257
Like I said,
I'm your attorney.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.550
{\an1}So, how's
your hangover?

22:23.633 --> 22:24.926
You know,
that's your brain shrinking.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.386
It's actually pulling away
from the skull.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.055
You see, the dehydrating effects
of alcohol...

22:28.138 --> 22:29.931
{\an4}I get the picture.
I don't think so.
You know,

22:30.015 --> 22:32.309
if you lose this case, you can
get up to five years probation.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.061
Maybe even get your
license suspended.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.270
Good luck getting
insurance again,

22:35.353 --> 22:36.980
{\an1}and tack that on
to the fines

22:37.064 --> 22:38.815
{\an3}and the D.U.I.
class costs,

22:38.899 --> 22:40.317
and you're gonna
like this one--

22:40.400 --> 22:42.194
{\an3}a year of mandatory
A.A. meetings.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.278
No, I don't need A.A. meetings.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.279
Now you got
the picture.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.614
I charge $300 an hour.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.074
It's a shade higher
than usual,

22:47.157 --> 22:49.117
{\an3}but frankly, I'm, uh,
strapped for cash,

22:49.201 --> 22:50.160
and I got a thing

22:50.243 --> 22:53.121
{\an3}about booze hounds driving
the same streets I do.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.623
Good day, Donna.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.709
Charming guy.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.135
Did he call?

23:07.219 --> 23:08.512
No.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.263
{\an3}When you said it
was important,

23:10.347 --> 23:12.349
{\an3}I thought maybe
you'd talked to him.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.478
This isn't about Carl.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.522
{\an3}It is...

23:18.605 --> 23:21.316
{\an1}but it's also about something
that's much more important.

23:21.399 --> 23:22.651
My husband just left me.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.319
{\an3}What could be more
important than that?

23:24.402 --> 23:25.529
Our relationship.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.197
(sighs) Whatever it
is, it can wait.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.323
{\an3}It can't.
It has to.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.491
Mom!

23:29.574 --> 23:30.492
I don't want to hear it!

23:30.575 --> 23:32.119
I slept with Carl.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.955
No, you didn't.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.748
In Vegas.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.501
The night before your wedding.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.884
You are so sick!

23:47.968 --> 23:50.554
Yeah, well, sleeping with
your father will do that to you.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.472
You seduced Carl?

23:52.556 --> 23:54.516
I looked his way,
he looked back.

23:54.599 --> 23:58.645
I had no idea
that you hated me so much.

23:58.728 --> 23:59.896
You knew.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.984
You knew I was being abused,
and you didn't do anything.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.987
When I found out,
I insisted he get help.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.989
You didn't make it stop.

24:09.072 --> 24:09.990
I tried.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.199
You failed.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.035
I didn't.

24:15.620 --> 24:18.248
Dad didn't commit suicide.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.210
I killed him.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.771
Is Donna around?
Put you both in the shot.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.273
{\an1}No. She went
to the apartment

24:43.356 --> 24:45.442
{\an1}to pick up some stuff,
but she said

24:45.525 --> 24:46.735
that you did great in court
with Noah today.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.695
They say good girls go
for bad guys.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.905
That's not true.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.365
Yeah. No kidding.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.658
See Bobby over there?

24:53.742 --> 24:54.910
Can't get a date.

24:54.993 --> 24:55.952
Breaking and entering.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.246
{\an3}Then again, Noah's only
up for a misdemeanor.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.456
Maybe that's the difference.

24:59.539 --> 25:01.625
Remind me. He's reformed, right?

25:01.708 --> 25:03.251
{\an3}Well, you couldn't ask
for more experience.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.961
Tell you something.
If he didn't catch

25:05.045 --> 25:07.923
{\an3}a flat tire on the 101, would
have been a millionaire.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.550
{\an1}Ah. Tell me not
to worry.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.760
{\an3}(laughs)
Totally reformed.

25:11.843 --> 25:12.928
Really. Seriously.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.804
{\an3}Would have got you
an iced tea, but

25:14.888 --> 25:16.598
I just spent my last two
bucks on this one here.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.434
And it's for a client...

25:19.517 --> 25:20.769
and he is late.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.270
Hmm. What's his crime?
His crime

25:22.354 --> 25:24.231
is being a, uh,
horrible husband.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.274
Wife's divorcing him, suing

25:26.358 --> 25:27.734
{\an3}for sole custody of
their three-month-old.

25:27.817 --> 25:29.110
Mm. That's so sad.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.570
What do you think's
gonna happen?

25:30.654 --> 25:32.155
I honestly couldn't say.

25:32.239 --> 25:35.450
Family law wasn't a specialty
over at Phelps, Hatton &amp; Cahill.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.785
Phelps, Hatton &amp; Cahill?

25:36.868 --> 25:38.411
{\an3}Yeah, Phelps,
Hatton &amp; Cahill.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.788
Yeah. Depositions this thick.

25:39.871 --> 25:40.830
That's a lot of billable hours.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.332
You get the picture.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.459
The picture,
the cars, the perks.

25:44.542 --> 25:45.460
{\an3}Yeah.

25:45.543 --> 25:46.419
And I don't miss 'em.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.796
{\an1}Hmm.
Lenny?

25:47.879 --> 25:49.923
{\an3}Over here.
Oh, hey.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.425
Look, sorry I'm late,

25:52.509 --> 25:54.469
but, uh, I heard
Allison was crying all night,

25:54.552 --> 25:56.263
so I... I stopped by the house.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.431
Unscheduled?
It's not a good idea.

25:58.515 --> 25:59.474
{\an1}Yeah.

25:59.557 --> 26:02.269
I know, but, uh, I thought
she might have a fever.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.479
Kelly, Lenny.

26:04.562 --> 26:05.647
Hi.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.607
You look so familiar.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.360
Really? I can't think why.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.071
So, uh,
what are you shooting there?

26:13.154 --> 26:14.030
An historical moment.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.074
{\an1}Kelly and her friend Donna
just opened up shop.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.201
I'm sorry. I...

26:18.285 --> 26:20.078
I just never forget a face.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.496
{\an3}MATT:
Oh, this way you'll

26:21.579 --> 26:24.124
never forget mine.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.503
{\an1}LENNY:
Smile.

26:28.586 --> 26:29.671
(laughs)

26:29.754 --> 26:32.299
(camera shutter clicks)

26:32.382 --> 26:34.301
(phone ringing)

26:40.098 --> 26:41.433
You on strike?

26:42.934 --> 26:44.060
Yeah. After Dark.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.854
Mm-hmm.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.897
That's not a problem.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.399
Yeah, we'll pick it up.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.192
Thanks.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.110
Cappuccino machine is fixed,

26:52.193 --> 26:54.696
and they're short
on delivery people.

26:54.779 --> 26:55.864
So? Your license
wasn't revoked.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.115
That's cute.

26:57.198 --> 26:59.826
Donna was thrilled to see me in
court. Thanks for telling her.

26:59.909 --> 27:01.536
Look, I've got
my own problems, okay?

27:01.619 --> 27:03.747
By the way,
if my mother calls, I'm out.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.081
What if she stops by?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.374
It's a good point.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.126
Okay, I'm going with you.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.670
You guys aren't
getting along?

27:10.754 --> 27:12.714
You could say that.
Well, I mean,

27:12.797 --> 27:14.257
{\an3}you're an adult. What's
she gonna do, ground you?

27:14.341 --> 27:15.925
No. She can tear me up
in three million pieces

27:16.009 --> 27:17.135
{\an1}with one look
and three sentences.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.095
You want to talk about it?
Do you want to hear about it?

27:19.179 --> 27:21.181
Absolutely not.
Good. Let's go.

27:21.264 --> 27:23.391
Let's go. Let's pick it up.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.437
Oh, hey.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.439
Oh.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.066
{\an1}Hey.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.610
Hi. Nice dress.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.487
Oh, it's nothing.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.696
{\an3}KELLY:
Just your

27:36.780 --> 27:38.114
{\an3}ordinary,
average, fabulous

27:38.198 --> 27:39.741
{\an3}Donna Martin
original.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.368
It's a condition with her.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.745
{\an1}Exaggeration.
It's kind of like asthma.

27:43.828 --> 27:44.746
Yeah.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.207
{\an3}Well, uh, Noah called me
after the arraignment.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.708
He asked me to represent him.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.251
Oh.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.379
{\an1}I, uh, guess
I should have told you.

27:52.462 --> 27:55.924
His arrest-- it was right after
his father's memorial service.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.300
Oh, really? Was his father ill?

27:57.384 --> 27:59.094
No. It was suicide.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.261
{\an3}So, he's been
going through a lot.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.264
Yeah. Alone.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.100
He's kind of a private person.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.602
{\an3}That's when most people
get hurt-- alone.

28:07.685 --> 28:10.063
So, what? Geometry?

28:10.146 --> 28:12.482
Physics? Spatial relations?

28:12.565 --> 28:14.275
{\an5}(laughs)
It's kind of
your thing?

28:14.359 --> 28:17.028
{\an1}Mm. Seems like the only
relations I'm good at lately.

28:17.112 --> 28:20.615
Oh. Well, if you need any help
unpacking, you just let me know.

28:20.698 --> 28:22.450
Okay. Thank you.
All right.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.953
See you, Kelly.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.122
Oops. Sorry.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.456
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.583
And I think he's available.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.961
{\an3}Oh, he left his
folders here.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.422
You know, he really is nice.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.631
{\an3}Wait a second.
I know this girl.

28:36.714 --> 28:39.175
{\an3}This is Leah. She
came into the clinic

28:39.259 --> 28:40.468
last year. That's
how I know Lenny.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.971
{\an3}Who?
Matt's client.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.098
He's a wife beater.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.772
(rock music playing)

28:52.856 --> 28:54.691
Freddie. Come on, man.
I set you up.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.276
The rest is up to you.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.527
FREDDIE:
No doubt.

28:57.610 --> 29:01.448
But listen, Jenna says she wants
to meet at the party tonight.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.450
She's going with a bunch
of girlfriends.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.368
A bunch?

29:05.452 --> 29:07.454
(scoffs)
Enjoy it.

29:07.537 --> 29:08.830
No interest.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.207
I want this girl.

29:11.291 --> 29:14.836
You, uh, think
she's shining me on?

29:14.919 --> 29:16.463
Uh...

29:16.546 --> 29:17.922
To be honest with you, man,

29:18.006 --> 29:20.175
with some girls,
it's hard to tell.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.260
(music volume increases)

29:24.387 --> 29:25.972
{\an3}I love Silver,
although sometimes

29:26.055 --> 29:28.016
{\an3}I'm not quite sure
what he's talking about.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.642
Can I quote you for my column?

29:29.726 --> 29:31.644
{\an3}Oh, absolutely.
You think that's...

29:31.728 --> 29:33.354
{\an3}This girl calls
the show earlier.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.481
{\an6}Hey.
STEVE:
Yeah?

29:34.564 --> 29:35.565
Hey. And, uh,

29:35.648 --> 29:38.902
{\an3}she says she's seeing this
guy that her girlfriend

29:38.985 --> 29:40.153
{\an3}also likes.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.362
Does the girlfriend know?

29:41.446 --> 29:42.655
That's the thing. No.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.033
{\an6}STEVE:
Oh. You better
write this down.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.159
It's gonna be good
for your column.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.036
{\an4}Column?
SOPHIE:
Yeah.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.078
The one I'm writing on you.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.872
That's why we're here together,
to interview you.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.333
Right.

29:53.416 --> 29:57.045
{\an3}Um, anyway,
the caller says that

29:57.128 --> 29:59.422
she's afraid her friend is gonna
be crushed when she finds out.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.049
{\an3}What I want
to know is,

30:01.132 --> 30:02.592
should I have told her
to come clean with her friend?

30:02.675 --> 30:04.552
Does the girlfriend have
a shot with this guy?

30:04.636 --> 30:06.846
{\an5}No.
STEVE:
Then I say, why add insult

30:06.930 --> 30:07.722
to injury?

30:07.805 --> 30:09.390
I hope you told her
to keep it quiet.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.225
You believe that?

30:10.308 --> 30:11.434
Don't tell me you told her

30:11.518 --> 30:12.227
to tell the truth?

30:12.310 --> 30:14.229
Yeah, I did,

30:14.312 --> 30:15.230
but I have a feeling

30:15.313 --> 30:16.272
she's not going to.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.899
Women.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.653
Women.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.075
NOAH (knocking): Donna, I know
it's late... let me in?

30:27.158 --> 30:29.244
Donna?

30:29.327 --> 30:31.204
Come on.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.873
{\an3}Hey.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.375
(sighs)

30:35.458 --> 30:37.544
I need you.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.587
I can't believe this.
You're drunk.

30:41.005 --> 30:41.965
Did you drive here yourself?

30:42.048 --> 30:45.343
{\an3}How do you think these
people do it? They just...

30:45.426 --> 30:48.805
{\an3}they talk and talk, and they
just get it all out, you know?

30:48.888 --> 30:51.266
{\an3}You think it works,
just talking about it?

30:51.349 --> 30:52.809
{\an1}No. You have to
pull it together.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.352
Need to be in court tomorrow.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.437
{\an3}I'm tired.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.274
Will you let me in?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.109
It's not funny.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.944
I keep asking you
the same thing.

31:03.027 --> 31:05.613
Look, I'll listen to you.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.948
I'll cry with you.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.075
{\an1}We'll drop it,
we can talk about it.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.244
{\an1}I'll do anything
you need me to do...

31:11.327 --> 31:12.453
when you're sober.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.498
I want to be with you tonight.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.711
I'm gonna call you a cab.

31:19.794 --> 31:22.463
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

31:22.547 --> 31:25.133
Will you please do this for me?

31:25.216 --> 31:26.509
I'd do anything for you.

31:26.593 --> 31:30.179
Okay. All right.

31:31.889 --> 31:33.474
{\an1}Why don't you go
sit down over there?

31:33.558 --> 31:35.310
I'm gonna go call,
and I'll come right back, okay?

31:35.393 --> 31:37.395
Okay.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.818
It's 3:00 a.m.

31:43.901 --> 31:45.111
I got your message.

31:45.194 --> 31:47.488
I'm glad you came.

31:47.572 --> 31:51.034
{\an1}Well, it's kind of an odd time
to be doing an interview.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.453
{\an3}Well, I would have
done it at the club,

31:53.536 --> 31:55.204
but you were
kind of busy.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.373
So were you.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.961
{\an3}You know, your
call-in, Freddie--

32:02.045 --> 32:03.796
{\an3}he's gonna get his
heart broken tonight.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.173
Really?

32:05.256 --> 32:07.300
So you can read
that girl's mind?

32:07.383 --> 32:09.802
No. His.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.388
{\an3}You know, you
imagine yourself

32:12.472 --> 32:15.558
{\an3}at a party, arm in arm with
the object of your affection.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.560
That's your costume.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.438
You're the one they want.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.691
I always felt completely
naked at those parties.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.194
(laughs)

32:26.277 --> 32:28.613
It's kind of hard
to imagine your lonely years.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.034
Here's a clue.

32:33.117 --> 32:34.369
I can't hurt Steve.

32:34.452 --> 32:37.664
He thinks that I can
be anything I want,

32:37.747 --> 32:39.207
and that I'm, like,
the greatest thing

32:39.290 --> 32:40.541
that ever happened to him,

32:40.625 --> 32:42.710
and tonight, I didn't
want to be the worst.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.421
Has nothing to do
with a free place to stay?

32:45.505 --> 32:48.508
I'm in the dorms
next week, I swear.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.887
Well, tomorrow...

32:52.970 --> 32:54.889
this, uh...

32:54.972 --> 32:57.392
sneaking around crap is over.

33:00.853 --> 33:03.022
Are we?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.244
{\an1}Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Sophie, the camera.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.328
Oh.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.585
{\an1}(laughs)
Okay.

34:21.391 --> 34:22.810
Hey, you're here early.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.812
{\an3}I was having
trouble sleeping.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.813
And I wondered
how you manage to.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.149
I realized I left these,

34:28.232 --> 34:29.900
{\an1}but you guys
were already gone.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.360
I wasn't snooping, but

34:31.444 --> 34:33.821
I saw that picture,
and I do know him.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.656
Actually, his wife.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.158
Your client is a monster.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.784
Wait. Should I be hearing this
right now?

34:38.868 --> 34:39.994
{\an3}I used to
work at a

34:40.077 --> 34:41.286
free clinic, and Leah, his wife,

34:41.370 --> 34:43.164
came in after he had beaten her.

34:43.246 --> 34:44.165
Are there any records?

34:44.248 --> 34:46.000
I saw the bruises.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.168
Did she file a formal complaint?

34:48.252 --> 34:49.337
I'm talking
to you like a friend,

34:49.420 --> 34:50.630
and you're acting like a lawyer.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.297
Lenny has a right
to representation, okay?

34:52.380 --> 34:53.382
Just like your pal Noah.

34:53.466 --> 34:55.635
Or maybe you don't think
I should defend him, either.

34:55.717 --> 34:57.303
Lenny hit a woman.

34:57.386 --> 34:58.513
And Noah drove drunk.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.139
But just because
I represent them

35:00.223 --> 35:01.891
doesn't mean I condone
what they did.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.893
The Constitution protects

35:03.976 --> 35:04.894
everyone's rights, okay?

35:04.977 --> 35:06.020
Even a guy like Lenny.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.313
That's a nice speech.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.731
I'm sure battered women

35:08.815 --> 35:11.275
across the nation
will be moved to tears.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.196
(door closes)

35:18.282 --> 35:19.826
(pounding door)

35:25.289 --> 35:26.833
What's all this?

35:26.916 --> 35:28.334
It's Sophie's.
She's moving out.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.837
Look, if you see her around,
let her know, okay?

35:30.920 --> 35:32.004
Steve.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.006
{\an3}Hey, look. Steve, look,
I've been wanting to tell you

35:34.090 --> 35:35.258
{\an5}for a long time.
"I'm sleeping
with her."

35:35.341 --> 35:36.384
How long did that take?

35:36.467 --> 35:39.220
Steve.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.513
{\an6}I'm so sorry.
STEVE:
Why don't you

35:40.596 --> 35:42.598
at least go put a robe on, you
opportunistic, selfish bitch?

35:42.682 --> 35:45.643
Look, just relax. Okay? We
handled it bad. It was awkward.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.061
{\an3}Awkward? Well, you
seemed pretty smooth

35:47.144 --> 35:48.813
last night on the Internet.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.898
Like you're old pros.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.192
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.278
You're famous in
my book, Sophie.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.073
That's all of it.

35:59.156 --> 36:02.535
It ain't much, Dave,
but it's yours now.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.748
(sighs)

36:10.167 --> 36:12.253
What are you doing?

36:12.336 --> 36:15.298
{\an3}Bringing my
stuff inside.

36:15.381 --> 36:18.092
{\an3}You know, an invitation would
feel really nice right now.

36:18.175 --> 36:19.468
{\an1}You know, Steve wouldn't
be this hurt

36:19.552 --> 36:21.262
{\an1}if he didn't think
he had some kind of chance.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.471
He had a crush.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.432
{\an3}Why do you think
they call it that?

36:24.515 --> 36:26.434
(scoffs)

36:26.517 --> 36:28.227
What day does the dorm open?

36:28.311 --> 36:30.229
Next week. I...

36:30.313 --> 36:31.606
I don't know.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.816
{\an1}Sophie, you haven't been
to class in weeks.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.651
You spent every dime
of that student loan.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.069
There is no dorm.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.946
{\an3}So I have other
priorities. So what?

36:39.030 --> 36:40.948
"I'm not using him, David."

36:41.032 --> 36:43.951
This has nothing to do
with a place to stay.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.122
{\an3}I'm not that hard
up for hospitality.

36:48.205 --> 36:49.290
{\an1}Fine.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.125
{\an3}I stayed with him
because I liked him.

36:51.208 --> 36:53.169
{\an5}I slept with
you, because...
Sophie.

36:54.211 --> 36:56.464
You just called me a whore.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.971
(sighs)

37:04.055 --> 37:05.806
ABBY:
<i>When I told you</i>

37:05.890 --> 37:07.767
{\an1}that Carl left me,
you acted surprised.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.810
{\an3}Like when I told you
about the abuse?

37:09.894 --> 37:11.520
So many lies.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.189
You know, when I asked you
to come here,

37:13.272 --> 37:14.315
I wanted to clear things up.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.150
You bring Carl, you didn't even
want to hear that...

37:16.233 --> 37:19.487
I have heard enough
to keep me up many nights.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.821
Imagining the two of you.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.324
Me and Carl--
I know it was stupid and wrong.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.660
You and your father.
You say you killed him.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.161
That was self-defense.

37:27.244 --> 37:28.412
Yet you staged a suicide.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.499
You put the gun in his hand, you
wiped the blood off yourself.

37:31.582 --> 37:32.583
I was scared!

37:32.667 --> 37:34.835
You know what he did was wrong,
but what you did...

37:34.919 --> 37:36.128
He got what he deserved.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.171
...was wrong, too.

37:37.254 --> 37:38.130
I don't think so.

37:38.214 --> 37:39.465
I do.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.300
But that's for a court
to decide.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.010
I'm not turning myself in.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.470
Get yourself a lawyer, Valerie,

37:44.553 --> 37:47.014
'cause if you don't
turn yourself in, I will.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.774
And as you can see from
the maintenance records,

37:56.857 --> 37:58.609
{\an3}Your Honor, the breathalyzer
had not undergone

37:58.693 --> 38:00.111
{\an3}the proper and
timely calibration.

38:00.194 --> 38:03.864
{\an1}The machine was calibrated
just eight days prior

38:03.948 --> 38:05.032
to Mr. Hunter's test.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.034
{\an1}Ten days is a statutory
requirement.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.329
{\an3}Yes, ten days,
or 150 uses.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.540
{\an3}My client was
the 154'th person

38:12.623 --> 38:14.250
to be tested in that period.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.544
You want me to let your client
off on a technicality?

38:16.627 --> 38:18.087
{\an1}MATT: With all due
respect, Your Honor,

38:18.170 --> 38:22.174
my client is alleged to have a
blood alcohol content of .09.

38:22.258 --> 38:26.053
Now, that's just 1/100 of a
percent above the legal limit.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.097
Now, with a margin of error
that narrow,

38:28.180 --> 38:29.056
the reliability of the test

38:29.140 --> 38:31.225
{\an3}could hardly be considered
a technicality.

38:31.308 --> 38:34.228
{\an1}The machine was tested
the very next day, Your Honor.

38:34.311 --> 38:35.021
It required no recalibration.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.939
Yes, but that's
no proof that...

38:37.023 --> 38:39.567
Mr. Durning, I will not argue
minutiae with you.

38:39.650 --> 38:42.236
The officers observed
erratic driving.

38:42.319 --> 38:43.779
There was an open container

38:43.863 --> 38:45.072
in the car.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.074
My client would plead guilty to
the open container, Your Honor.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.077
Good try, Counselor,
but drunk is drunk.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.871
Mr. Hunter?

38:54.874 --> 38:57.084
Fine is $1,000.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.085
Probation for one year,

38:58.169 --> 39:00.588
during which you will attend
a 90-day alcohol

39:00.671 --> 39:02.965
{\an1}treatment program
and 12 A.A. meetings.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.259
Wind up in my courtroom
again on this charge,

39:05.342 --> 39:06.260
and you go to jail.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.595
Am I clear?

39:07.678 --> 39:08.721
Yes, Your Honor.

39:08.804 --> 39:11.557
Due to the lateness of the hour,
this court is adjourned

39:11.640 --> 39:13.601
{\an5}until 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.
(gavel bangs)

39:13.684 --> 39:15.770
Thank you, Your Honor.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.229
{\an3}Oh, boy.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.230
{\an3}Thanks for
the effort.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.565
I appreciate it.

39:19.648 --> 39:20.941
And I'd appreciate $1,100.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.651
(scoffs) I miss
something here?

39:22.735 --> 39:24.111
{\an1}Yeah. You could have
killed someone,

39:24.195 --> 39:25.780
and I almost got you off.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.949
{\an1}I don't know who to be more
upset with-- you or me.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.242
A lawyer with
a conscience.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.744
What do you know?

39:31.827 --> 39:33.287
Pretty steep penalty.

39:33.370 --> 39:35.122
Price I pay

39:35.206 --> 39:36.957
{\an3}for letting my
father get to me.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.335
Will you talk to me
about that? Please?

39:40.211 --> 39:42.254
{\an3}(sighs)

39:46.258 --> 39:49.929
{\an3}The eulogy I
never delivered.

39:50.012 --> 39:51.138
I'd like to read it.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.224
{\an1}Can I?

39:54.725 --> 39:56.852
I'd like that.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.200
(phone ringing)

40:13.410 --> 40:15.413
(ringing continues)

40:16.747 --> 40:18.499
Hello?

40:18.582 --> 40:20.167
Brandon, hi.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.503
Oh, please. No.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.131
You've been busy.
I totally understand.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.841
How'd the interview go?

40:28.092 --> 40:29.510
(knocking)

40:29.593 --> 40:31.345
Hang on a sec.

40:31.428 --> 40:32.847
Yeah?

40:32.930 --> 40:34.515
When we used to play well
together.

40:40.479 --> 40:42.064
Are you dropping the case?

40:42.148 --> 40:43.190
No.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.693
Ah. Thanks for the memories.

40:45.776 --> 40:48.529
You know, you're not too good
at giving second chances.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.197
Like Leah gave Lenny?

40:56.871 --> 40:58.372
Sorry.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.126
Nobody.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.659
♪ ♪

41:52.009 --> 41:54.220
FREDDY (over phone):
She cheated on me, man.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.221
She-She cheated.

41:55.304 --> 41:58.432
DAVID:
Freddy, slow down. Okay?

41:58.515 --> 42:00.809
Now, uh...

42:00.893 --> 42:02.436
You're at the party.

42:02.519 --> 42:04.271
And she asked me
to get her a beer.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.482
I'd drive to Canada
to get the kind she likes.

42:06.565 --> 42:10.069
When I come back,
she's in the car with Joe.

42:10.152 --> 42:12.154
What do I do?

42:13.197 --> 42:15.950
Forget about her.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.493
How's that for impossible?

42:17.576 --> 42:19.578
Hold on a second.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.121
(rock music plays)

42:21.205 --> 42:25.292
Okay, let's see, um...

42:25.376 --> 42:28.128
If you're by
yourself tonight, I'd...

42:28.212 --> 42:31.507
I'd say "join the club,"
but it's not much of a club.

42:31.590 --> 42:34.927
It happens to a lot of people.

42:37.221 --> 42:40.140
{\an5}NOAH:
<i>I remember my dad</i>
<i>in bits and pieces,</i>

42:40.224 --> 42:42.142
<i>like the night</i>
<i>he came into my room.</i>

42:42.226 --> 42:43.102
<i>I'm a little kid,</i>

42:43.185 --> 42:45.145
<i>and I'm supposed to be</i>
<i>asleep hours ago.</i>

42:45.229 --> 42:46.480
<i>So I pretend.</i>

42:46.563 --> 42:49.191
<i>Turns out he's been</i>
<i>pretending, too...</i>

42:49.275 --> 42:51.318
<i>to be strong.</i>

42:51.402 --> 42:53.570
<i>'Cause when I open my eyes,</i>
<i>he's at the window</i>

42:53.654 --> 42:55.531
<i>with his shoulders</i>
<i>moving up and down</i>

42:55.614 --> 42:57.449
<i>'cause he's been crying.</i>

42:57.533 --> 42:58.701
<i>Then he goes.</i>

42:58.784 --> 43:00.744
<i>After he closed the door,</i>
<i>I hear him say,</i>

43:00.828 --> 43:02.997
<i>"Good night, Noah,"</i>
<i>through a closed door.</i>

43:03.080 --> 43:05.291
<i>There's always</i>
<i>this closed door between us.</i>

43:08.419 --> 43:11.171
<i>It's locked now,</i>
<i>with no key in sight.</i>

43:11.255 --> 43:13.966
<i>He took his with him.</i>

43:14.049 --> 43:16.051
<i>And I can't find mine.</i>
