00:17.466 --> 00:22.883
It's alive!

00:41.451 --> 00:44.062
I, Kratos, the God of War,

00:44.097 --> 00:48.034
feed the Blades of Chaos with
the blood orbs of your souls!

00:50.458 --> 00:55.719
Quickly, Kratos, pleasure your lovers
and receive a bounty of blood orbs.

00:55.778 --> 00:57.778
Uh... one of them's a dude.

00:57.780 --> 00:59.880
What's the problem?
You're in Greece.

00:59.915 --> 01:01.395
I'm not sleeping with a dude!

01:01.397 --> 01:06.569
Surely you would at least let him
watch if I offered you 1,000 blood orbs.

01:06.604 --> 01:09.302
<i>The Blades of Chaos are
thirsty.</i>

01:09.304 --> 01:11.135
I could not turn that down.

01:11.170 --> 01:15.338
Then let's make it 1,500 and
he gets to play with your balls.

01:15.373 --> 01:17.306
What do you think I am?

01:17.341 --> 01:19.746
We've already established
what you are.

01:19.748 --> 01:21.354
Now we're just negotiating.

01:21.383 --> 01:25.189
Oh, I see what you did there.
Very smug and demeaning.

01:25.224 --> 01:28.403
I'm just gonna throw this out
there- 2,000 blood orbs.

01:28.657 --> 01:30.222
Anything goes.

01:33.128 --> 01:34.545
All right.

01:35.631 --> 01:38.560
You're not gonna watch, are you?

01:38.634 --> 01:41.021
Only as long as I need to.

01:42.638 --> 01:44.600
Eh, nah.

01:45.808 --> 01:48.168
Sweetie, I'm home.

01:48.610 --> 01:49.776
Honey?

01:49.778 --> 01:51.768
Sharon, what happened?

01:55.584 --> 01:58.378
- Oh, good. You're awake.
- Who's there?

01:58.454 --> 01:59.386
Don't you know?

01:59.388 --> 02:02.522
Oh, no, that's right, you
wouldn't know my voice, would you?

02:02.557 --> 02:04.666
'Cause you never even
heard me scream.

02:05.027 --> 02:07.054
Now you remember me?

02:07.062 --> 02:08.461
Not so fast!

02:08.464 --> 02:09.833
Look, I don't know
what you want.

02:09.876 --> 02:13.203
What I want? I want my life
back, you son of a bitch!

02:13.235 --> 02:14.391
Now sit down.

02:15.571 --> 02:16.403
Have a bite.

02:16.405 --> 02:18.071
I'm not- I'm not hungry.

02:18.073 --> 02:19.213
And I'm not asking.

02:19.248 --> 02:20.841
This is what you wanted, right?

02:20.876 --> 02:21.208
Uh-huh.

02:21.210 --> 02:22.413
A nice piece of fish?

02:22.578 --> 02:25.011
I guess I wasn't big
enough for you, was I?

02:25.013 --> 02:27.281
So you just take and
you take and you take

02:27.282 --> 02:29.352
and you don't care who
you hurt along the way.

02:29.551 --> 02:31.221
Look what you did to me!

02:31.256 --> 02:32.520
I died that day!

02:32.555 --> 02:34.152
But th-th-that was just
this morning.

02:34.423 --> 02:35.764
Take a fucking bite.

02:38.093 --> 02:40.122
Mmm. Good, huh?

02:40.429 --> 02:41.646
Sharon!

02:41.681 --> 02:43.263
At least the sharks make it quick.

02:43.265 --> 02:45.975
You can't blame 'em
'cause you feel no pain.

02:46.010 --> 02:49.756
But you- you don't even have the
stones to finish what you started.

02:49.838 --> 02:52.205
That's where you're wrong.

02:53.942 --> 02:55.327
Ow! Fuck!

03:02.487 --> 03:04.818
Hello!
Welcome to my pipe store, sir!

03:04.820 --> 03:05.519
Hey!

03:05.521 --> 03:08.054
You're the white rap kid from
90210!

03:08.056 --> 03:09.723
You're Brian Austin Green,
right?

03:09.725 --> 03:14.204
Well, I used to be an actor, but now
I'm following my true love- Pipes!

03:15.297 --> 03:16.566
Oh, yeah!

03:16.601 --> 03:18.598
Now that sign
makes a lot more sense!

03:18.633 --> 03:20.636
Now, can I help you
find a pipe?

03:20.671 --> 03:23.265
Hey, say, didn't you used to
date Megan Fox?

03:23.300 --> 03:24.271
That was a long time ago.

03:24.273 --> 03:25.272
What happened?

03:25.274 --> 03:28.615
I told you, man- pipes are
my one true love.

03:30.612 --> 03:32.412
I need a box to ship some
antiques.

03:32.414 --> 03:34.147
I'm sure I can
help you with that.

03:34.149 --> 03:35.949
Hey, you're Megan Fox,
the actress.

03:35.951 --> 03:36.816
<i>Former actress.</i>

03:36.818 --> 03:37.817
Boxes are my life now.

03:37.819 --> 03:40.720
Didn't you used to date that,
uh, Austin Greenbriar or whoever?

03:40.722 --> 03:41.922
Brian Austin Green, yeah.

03:41.924 --> 03:44.982
But these days, boxes are my
one true love.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.564
Excuse me, miss, do you
have any boxes that would fit...

03:49.064 --> 03:50.397
my heart?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.332
Well, I know
I'm the third wheel!

03:57.773 --> 04:02.344
You mean all this time, you were
running B.A.G. Pipes next door?

04:02.379 --> 04:04.838
You're the owner of
Fox's Boxes?

04:04.880 --> 04:08.206
I guess, that some things are
just meant to be.

04:09.551 --> 04:12.719
♪ And all this time, I never ♪

04:12.721 --> 04:16.055
♪ saw the lighthouse
on your heart ♪

04:18.392 --> 04:22.599
And together, they formed the most
successful pipe-shipping company

04:22.634 --> 04:24.264
in the United States.

04:24.266 --> 04:27.873
Yeah, well, that ends the 46th and
final season of "Masterpiece Theatre."

04:27.908 --> 04:31.293
Toward the end, I became very confused about
what this show was trying to accomplish,

04:31.328 --> 04:34.681
and quite honestly, PBS viewers grew
outraged their pledge money was funding it.

04:34.716 --> 04:37.788
I'm not sure what I'll do with my
career in the months and years to come,

04:37.823 --> 04:40.406
but I can guarantee you
I won't be book-ending tales

04:40.441 --> 04:43.037
about Brian Austin Green
running a fucking pipe store.

04:43.485 --> 04:45.447
Oh, did I go off-script?

04:45.487 --> 04:48.074
Did I ruin your precious take,
you insufferable prick?

04:48.190 --> 04:51.146
Brian Austin Green can swing
from my balls.

04:51.159 --> 04:52.471
Get a good grip, Brian!

04:52.506 --> 04:54.494
You've destroyed
"Masterpiece Theatre"!

04:54.496 --> 04:56.139
You fucking destroyed it!

04:56.832 --> 05:00.619
So, uh, we still have a lot
of those tote bags left.

05:04.921 --> 05:10.110
You killed me, Billy!

05:10.535 --> 05:14.219
One day, my son, all this
will belong to you!

05:14.616 --> 05:15.389
What's this?

05:15.550 --> 05:17.405
It must be a sign
from the gods!

05:17.552 --> 05:19.219
They are showing us favor!

05:19.221 --> 05:20.887
Ooh- that's a little warm.

05:24.893 --> 05:26.701
Father!

05:27.229 --> 05:32.111
Why? Why? Wh-y-y-y?!

05:36.161 --> 05:38.845
Hey, check it out, baby!

05:38.880 --> 05:41.083
You've got an admirer.

05:41.118 --> 05:43.462
Oh, wow.
That's great.

05:43.912 --> 05:45.337
What are you doing?

05:45.372 --> 05:47.414
Get over there and talk to her!

05:47.449 --> 05:50.550
Haven't you noticed she looks
exactly like me, but in drag?

05:50.552 --> 05:50.884
So?

05:50.886 --> 05:52.362
What am I, a fucking
narcissist?

05:52.397 --> 05:53.854
I need to look at myself
while I'm busting a-

05:53.917 --> 05:55.082
Oh, God, she's coming over.

05:57.092 --> 05:59.193
Oh, my goodness!

05:59.228 --> 06:01.637
I'm a hideous woman!

06:03.765 --> 06:05.802
Want to get out of here?

06:06.768 --> 06:10.408
Well, I guess the Daily Planet's
a fucking iPad app now.

06:10.443 --> 06:12.405
I'm out on my ass 'cause I never
learned Photoshop.

06:12.407 --> 06:13.540
Clark, you idiot!

06:13.542 --> 06:16.343
I couldn't figure out layers, Lois.
Sue me!

06:16.378 --> 06:16.676
No!

06:16.678 --> 06:19.432
You were supposed to remind me
to Tivo "Top Chef."

06:19.467 --> 06:20.547
Oh, I guess I didn't hear you.

06:20.549 --> 06:24.209
But you can hear a boy scout
getting bad-touched 600 miles away?

06:24.244 --> 06:24.484
You know what?

06:24.486 --> 06:28.029
Do that thing where you fly around the
Earth really fast and go back in time!

06:28.064 --> 06:30.390
Okay, I'm not gonna travel
through time for "Top Chef."

06:30.392 --> 06:32.143
Do you want a divorce, Clark?!

06:36.772 --> 06:39.811
You know, I love this show,
but I hate to cook,

06:39.846 --> 06:41.181
which is so weird, right?

06:41.259 --> 06:42.068
- There you are.
- Clark?

06:42.070 --> 06:45.143
Look, if I don't remind you to Tivo
"Top Chef," you're going to forget-

06:45.240 --> 06:47.270
You really think I'm stupid,
don't you?

06:47.305 --> 06:50.044
No, no, I- Can I get a
moment please?

06:50.712 --> 06:54.362
Look, sweetie, you sent me back
in time to remind you-

06:54.397 --> 06:57.019
Well, you embarrassed me.
Go back and do it right!

06:57.054 --> 06:58.987
I really shouldn't-

06:59.022 --> 07:03.539
Oh, right, so you'll go back in time for
future Lois but you won't do it for me?

07:03.558 --> 07:06.175
I will do it for you.

07:06.361 --> 07:08.498
Up and away.

07:11.512 --> 07:14.863
Lois, wait!
Where are your girlfriends?

07:14.898 --> 07:15.869
Are you checking up on me?

07:15.871 --> 07:17.303
You're smothering me, Clark!

07:17.305 --> 07:20.275
No, no, sweetheart, look,
you forgot to Tivo "Top Chef,"

07:20.310 --> 07:21.741
so I went back in time as a-

07:21.743 --> 07:25.545
Oh, well, you'll go back in time for
some stupid TV show but not for me?

07:25.547 --> 07:26.955
But that's not even-

07:26.990 --> 07:29.149
Give me a second.

07:34.306 --> 07:36.940
Hey!

07:36.975 --> 07:39.194
- You're me!
- That's right, from the future.

07:39.229 --> 07:41.294
Look, I know you're gonna tell
Lois about "Top Chef."

07:41.296 --> 07:44.197
But she's gonna take it the
wrong way and have a shit fit?

07:44.199 --> 07:47.393
I- I already knew what was
going to happen, didn't I?

07:47.636 --> 07:49.878
I'm in a dysfunctional
relationship.

07:50.138 --> 07:51.859
I just needed to talk it out...

07:51.894 --> 07:53.256
with someone I trusted.

07:53.542 --> 07:57.272
Sweet Mary and Joseph!
I am an attractive man.

07:57.307 --> 07:59.354
So, you thinking
what I'm thinking?

08:00.248 --> 08:02.827
Oh, God! Somebody help me!

08:03.251 --> 08:05.867
Ugh- like nails on a
chalkboard.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.317
I was just thinking that.

08:07.352 --> 08:07.636
Jinx!

08:07.754 --> 08:09.090
- Buy me a coke!
- You buy me one!

08:09.125 --> 08:09.645
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

08:09.680 --> 08:10.117
Jinx!

08:10.196 --> 08:12.226
Ba-da-bap, ba-da-bap,
Superman!

08:15.795 --> 08:17.390
Play the pipe cones.

08:30.712 --> 08:32.611
Well, that's a lot better
than our song, Steve.

08:32.614 --> 08:34.977
They're playing a crunchy tune!

08:35.011 --> 08:36.697
We're getting
embarrassed out here!

08:44.526 --> 08:46.059
They've got a backbeat!

08:46.061 --> 08:47.227
Bring in the snare!

08:47.229 --> 08:49.963
