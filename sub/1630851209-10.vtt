WEBVTT

00:05.614 --> 00:06.658
What happened to this country?

00:10.097 --> 00:11.098
Bravo.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.031
<i>It's a really weird time
in the household</i>

00:31.074 --> 00:35.078
because Colin Robinson
is no longer with us.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.080
I mean, vampires are
no strangers to death.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.648
They deal with it every day
with the people that they kill.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.563
But when they lose
one of their own,

00:41.606 --> 00:43.173
they just don't know
how to deal with it.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.088
<i>I mean, their only
funeral-type tradition</i>

00:45.132 --> 00:46.872
<i>is that they get
a new portrait made</i>

00:46.916 --> 00:48.483
<i>with all of them except for
the newly deceased,</i>

00:48.526 --> 00:49.962
<i>and I don't think that's
a really healthy way</i>

00:50.006 --> 00:52.095
of dealing with the loss
of a family member.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.402
Perhaps we'd all like
to go around the room

00:54.445 --> 00:56.969
and each one of say something
that we liked

00:57.013 --> 00:59.015
- about Colin Robinson?
- Oh, leave us alone, Guillermo.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.538
You're giving everyone
a big bummer.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.192
When she's right, she's right.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.020
Should he even be here?
I know.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.502
I did think this was sort of
a "vampires only" portrait.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.199
Hey, he is a valued member
of the team

01:09.243 --> 01:12.115
and has every right
to be in this portrait.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.770
Even though he is a dog.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.250
I wasn't talking about the dog,
you halfwit,

01:16.293 --> 01:17.860
I was talking about Gizmo.

01:17.903 --> 01:18.948
Yes, well,
Gizmo needs to be here

01:18.991 --> 01:20.863
to help control the Hellhound.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.212
<i>If they talked about
their feelings,</i>

01:22.256 --> 01:23.605
<i>then the healing could begin.</i>

01:23.648 --> 01:24.780
- Guillermo,

01:24.823 --> 01:26.173
your Hellhound is
wandering around

01:26.216 --> 01:27.826
and pissing all over
our floors.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.133
<i>And once they're healed,
they would realize that</i>

01:30.177 --> 01:31.613
<i>the dynamic's a little off.</i>

01:31.656 --> 01:34.311
So maybe they need
to make a new vampire.

01:34.355 --> 01:37.575
I-I just heard it,
and I know...

01:37.619 --> 01:39.142
I know what you're thinking,

01:39.186 --> 01:41.405
but I truly believe that
that's what's needed

01:41.449 --> 01:44.713
to really restore--
And I deserve it.

<i>Yeah,
I took up painting</i>

02:23.578 --> 02:25.232
during season two
of <i>Grounded for Life.</i>

02:25.275 --> 02:26.711
As an actor,
you spend a lot of time

02:26.755 --> 02:28.452
sitting around your trailer,
waiting for them

02:28.496 --> 02:30.193
to light the next scene
or whatnot,

02:30.237 --> 02:33.327
so I got some brushes
and a how-to book from Blick,

02:33.370 --> 02:34.893
and I think I've gotten
pretty good.

02:34.937 --> 02:37.244
<i>This is the cast of
Grounded for Life.</i>

02:37.287 --> 02:39.550
<i>Oh, my God, Jake and Griffin
were so squirrely,</i>

02:39.594 --> 02:41.378
<i>I was like,
"Look, here's the deal.</i>

02:41.422 --> 02:43.598
"I'm gonna take a picture,
and then you guys can fuck off

02:43.641 --> 02:45.991
and do whatever
you want to do."

02:46.035 --> 02:48.603
<i>I finished the painting
from a photo, but you know,</i>

02:48.646 --> 02:50.866
that's the way a lot
of the masters work now.

02:50.909 --> 02:53.477
<i>This is the front gate
of Radford in Studio City.</i>

02:53.521 --> 02:55.653
<i>I was really happy with
the way the light reflected</i>

02:55.697 --> 02:57.525
<i>off the admin building
that day.</i>

02:57.568 --> 03:00.049
I think I really captured it.

03:00.092 --> 03:02.791
<i>This was a gaffer
I worked with onER.</i>

03:02.834 --> 03:04.662
<i>The guy had just
such an amazing face,</i>

03:04.706 --> 03:06.229
<i>I was just staring at it.</i>

03:06.273 --> 03:07.926
I was staring at it
when I was on camera,

03:07.970 --> 03:09.754
which would get me in trouble,
you know?

03:09.798 --> 03:12.931
<i>But I think
I really got his essence.</i>

03:12.975 --> 03:14.585
So when the gang here said
that they needed

03:14.629 --> 03:16.239
a new portrait done,
I said I'd be more than happy

03:16.283 --> 03:18.894
to stick around and do it
because I had some downtime

03:18.937 --> 03:21.549
between the next meeting of
the Worldwide Vampiric Council

03:21.592 --> 03:25.335
and the two-episode arc
I booked on <i>SVU</i> next month.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.424
You gotta remember
I came up with MTV in the '90s,

03:27.468 --> 03:29.296
where they were like,
"Go shoot 15 hours

03:29.339 --> 03:30.862
"of <i>Jimmy the Cab Driver,</i>

03:30.906 --> 03:32.386
and then we'll figure out
where to stick it later,"

03:32.429 --> 03:34.039
- but when I got <i>Grounded...
Oof.</i>

03:34.083 --> 03:35.824
- This buhbutz is really
killing me.
- I know.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.261
Right? I mean,
I like the cinema,

03:38.305 --> 03:40.524
but don't need to know
how the sausage is made.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.309
Yeah, and it's kind of
insensitive.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.527
I mean, we're all still
mourning the death

03:43.571 --> 03:45.181
- of Colin Robinson.
- I'm not.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.226
Well, that's what
I'm talking about.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.749
We need to talk about that.

03:47.792 --> 03:48.532
- How you're feeling...
- We don't need to talk

03:48.576 --> 03:49.968
about anything.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.796
We are having our picture
painted.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.016
Then we will have a picture
that Colin Robinson is not in,

03:54.059 --> 03:55.583
and we can forget about him
forever,

03:55.626 --> 03:56.888
and this will heal us.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.890
Why did we have to rush it?

03:58.934 --> 04:00.196
The corpse has barely
begun to stink,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.719
and we've got the <i>Tao of Steve</i>

04:01.763 --> 04:03.286
- painting our portrait.
Oh, here we go.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.071
Nadja's masking her
true feelings with a joke.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.073
That was not a joke.
A joke has a punchline.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.553
And you wouldn't know
a punchline if it ran over

04:09.597 --> 04:11.251
your scrotum with
a penny farthing!

04:13.470 --> 04:16.299
Oh, I am sorry,
but that was a good one.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.171
Also, I feast upon hate.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.304
You know what?
Fuck this whole thing!

04:21.348 --> 04:24.351
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

04:24.394 --> 04:27.963
You're cool.
Fuck you, and fuck you!

04:28.006 --> 04:29.486
- Fuck all this shit!
- Whoa.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.314
You are not storming away
from me.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.099
I am storming away from you,
but in a different direction!

04:34.143 --> 04:35.840
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Fuck you.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.189
You know what,
maybe we should just

04:37.233 --> 04:38.887
take five, shake it off.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.889
When he says "take five,"
five of what?

04:40.932 --> 04:42.412
And where are we taking them?

04:42.456 --> 04:45.415
This last year,
it has not been easy on me.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.765
<i>My search for love has</i>

04:47.809 --> 04:49.332
been stymied at every turn.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.073
- I'm a lesbian.
- Are you sure?

04:51.116 --> 04:52.248
Definitely sure.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.250
Would you do me the honor
of being

04:54.294 --> 04:55.686
my vampire bride?

04:55.730 --> 04:57.645
I was married before.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.951
<i>I discovered that
there is no meaning or purpose</i>

04:59.995 --> 05:01.823
<i>to the universe,</i>

05:01.866 --> 05:03.607
because of the Big Bang Theory.

05:03.651 --> 05:06.741
And on top of all that,
the death of Colin Robinson--

05:06.784 --> 05:10.440
it has, I must confess,
hit me quite hard.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.355
Life is precious.

05:12.399 --> 05:15.358
Even so-called eternal life
can be snuffed out

05:15.402 --> 05:17.055
at a moment's notice.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.841
Colin Robinson's head imploding
into a pile of goo

05:19.884 --> 05:24.628
has made me realize that I need
to make the most of my life.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.762
Which is why I've decided
to leave Staten Island

05:27.805 --> 05:29.764
- and travel the world.
- What?

05:29.807 --> 05:33.071
Visit the Great Fjords of
whatever country they're in.

05:33.115 --> 05:35.160
Get a job on one of those boats
that collect plastic

05:35.204 --> 05:36.945
- from the ocean.
- What the hell
are you talking about?

05:36.988 --> 05:40.905
- Guillermo, did I not tell you
all this already?
- No.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.777
- Sorry. Would you mind giving
us a moment?
- Sorry.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.344
Can you just give us
one minute?

05:44.387 --> 05:45.606
- Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.259
Careful with the rug.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.913
You can't make any rational
decisions right now

05:48.957 --> 05:50.437
because you're dealing
with Colin Robinson's death

05:50.480 --> 05:51.786
and you're running away
from your feelings.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.396
Yeah. So what?
I hate my feelings.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.137
You know what, this plan,
it sounds great out loud,

05:55.180 --> 05:56.921
but I-I, I just can't drop
everything that I'm doing.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.488
I have duties, you know.
Responsibilities.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.272
Like, my mom is here.
I can't just pack a bag

06:00.316 --> 06:01.665
and go on a world tour with you
at the drop of a hat.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.494
You're not coming with me.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.409
What?

06:06.453 --> 06:08.672
You are one of the things
I need to get away from

06:08.716 --> 06:10.326
to make a fresh start.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.502
No offense.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.330
Okay, well,
how you gonna travel?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.114
Just by night?
You're just gonna carry

06:16.158 --> 06:17.768
your ancestral dirt with you
and your coffin wherever you go?

06:17.812 --> 06:20.031
- That-that's insane.
- Yes, you're right.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.772
There's a lot of details
to figure out.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.862
And you are going
to figure them out for me.

06:24.906 --> 06:27.387
- Oh, surprise, surprise.
- As your last duty.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.956
My sweet, sweet Guillermo.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.177
You don't understand because?

06:35.220 --> 06:37.179
I'm not a vampire.

06:37.222 --> 06:39.616
Yes! Trust me,

06:39.660 --> 06:42.489
Nadja and Laszlo,
they are itching to get away.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.274
These vampire pods,
they don't last forever.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.450
And I'm not gonna be
the last one in here

06:47.494 --> 06:50.018
all alone like a fucking loser.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.501
I would rather not talk
about the death

06:54.544 --> 06:57.591
of Shmolin Shmobinson
because my dear husband Laszlo

06:57.634 --> 06:59.114
is having a bit of
a hard time dealing with it.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.594
What are you talking about?

07:00.637 --> 07:02.378
I said you were having
a hard time dealing

07:02.422 --> 07:04.859
with Colin Robinson's very
disgusting and tragic death.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.296
Well, that would be bullshit,
then, wouldn't it, my darling?

07:07.339 --> 07:09.037
I couldn't give a tinker's fig.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.473
- People die all the time.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.954
- Animals die, plants die.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.042
Oh, Gizmo, it's just you.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.783
It's kind of important.

07:15.826 --> 07:18.002
Can't you see I'm doing my
talking-to-the-camera thing?

07:18.046 --> 07:20.614
I'm busy. Shoo!

07:20.657 --> 07:22.137
...by lunchtime I was
in the whorehouse

07:22.180 --> 07:24.487
with two prostitutes
and three good-time boys.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.229
Hold on, I've just had
the best idea.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.448
I think I might know
just the thing

07:28.491 --> 07:30.493
to cheer you up, my love.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.016
I don't need cheering up.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.801
How's about me and you
take a lovely little trip

07:33.844 --> 07:37.108
- back to merry old England?
- No.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.762
We could get a red bus
and make love in it.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.983
We could get a black cab
and make love in it.

07:42.026 --> 07:44.420
We could go to Madame Tussaud's
and look around.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.117
If I were to need
rest and recuperation

07:46.161 --> 07:49.120
for my dear friend's death,
that fuck hole would be

07:49.164 --> 07:51.035
the last place on Earth

07:51.079 --> 07:52.428
that I would choose
to go back to.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.909
You know this.
I made a precious vow

07:54.952 --> 07:58.129
- never to go back there again.
- Laszlo! Ugh!

07:58.173 --> 08:01.350
United Kingdom?
United Ding-dong, more like.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.961
Nadja, Nadja,
I really need your help.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.397
It's about Nandor.

08:07.008 --> 08:10.881
- I suppose we just wait.
I don't know.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.404
We have a problem.

08:12.448 --> 08:13.928
You are not the only one
with problems, Gizmo!

08:13.971 --> 08:15.843
Look at you.
"Oh, everyone feel sorry for me

08:15.886 --> 08:17.322
"'cause I'm a pathetic human,

08:17.366 --> 08:18.846
"and I can't fly,
and all I do is

08:18.889 --> 08:20.456
sit on the toilet all day."

08:20.500 --> 08:23.590
Well, what about my needs?
Look. Look at this.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.899
Uh, that's not how that works.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.422
- Oh, you do it!
- Okay.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.512
This is a glass paperweight,

08:32.555 --> 08:35.123
and this is the TV control.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.081
- We push this in...
- Patronizing.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.692
...and play.

08:41.956 --> 08:45.089
<i>-This is not taping over
RuPaul, is it?
- No, no.</i>

08:45.133 --> 08:46.830
<i>-'Cause I haven't seen
the latest episode.
- It's a fresh...</i>

08:46.874 --> 08:49.180
<i>-Okay, good. What?
- We're recording.</i>

08:49.224 --> 08:50.747
<i>Oh. Ahem.</i>

08:50.791 --> 08:54.272
<i>Dark greetings,
Nadja of Antipaxos.</i>

08:54.316 --> 08:56.710
<i>You must know by now
that I've had my eye on you</i>

08:56.753 --> 08:58.363
<i>for quite some time.</i>

08:58.407 --> 09:00.975
<i>Your work on your local
Vampiric Council</i>

09:01.018 --> 09:03.891
<i>has been quite impressive.
Yas, queen.</i>

09:03.934 --> 09:06.023
<i>Everyone is going on about it.</i>

09:06.067 --> 09:09.461
<i>And thus, we would be delighted
for you to join us</i>

09:09.505 --> 09:11.681
<i>in London, in England,</i>

09:11.725 --> 09:14.162
<i>where you will take a position
that ranks amongst</i>

09:14.205 --> 09:18.427
<i>the highest of all worldwide
Vampiric Council positions.</i>

09:18.470 --> 09:20.690
<i>We do hope you'll accept
this offer promptly,</i>

09:20.734 --> 09:22.736
<i>because as you know,
vampires hate waiting.</i>

09:22.779 --> 09:26.087
<i>Even though we're immortal,
waiting is just still a thing.</i>

09:26.130 --> 09:29.003
<i>So, if you accept,
as fast as you can,</i>

09:29.046 --> 09:32.528
<i>tape your acceptance speech
on a VHS tape, and then</i>

09:32.572 --> 09:35.575
<i>put it in an envelope
and send it by mail,</i>

09:35.618 --> 09:37.794
<i>and eventually
it'll get to us.</i>

09:37.838 --> 09:39.579
<i>This is your last ch...</i>

09:39.622 --> 09:41.624
You're thinking of leaving, too?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.583
Of course I want to leave.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.846
It is such a great honor
and opportunity,

09:45.889 --> 09:48.065
and I would have a chance
to finally do something

09:48.109 --> 09:49.763
with my stupid eternal life.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.199
But it is not to be.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.417
- Good.
- What?!

09:52.461 --> 09:53.897
I mean, uh, why?

09:53.941 --> 09:56.204
Because Laszlo will never
go back to England.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.249
You heard him.
He has sworn it.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.121
But I cannot leave him
on his own.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.646
You know, I went on holiday
for two weeks in 1924,

10:03.690 --> 10:05.692
and when I got back,
he hadn't fed himself once.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.956
He spent all his time writing
poetry and wanking.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.522
So, no, I can't go.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.873
So you're saying
if Laszlo doesn't go,

10:12.916 --> 10:15.789
then you certainly won't go?

10:15.832 --> 10:18.008
I literally just
said that to you.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.012
I know it seems like
I'm panicking,

10:22.056 --> 10:23.840
but I'm not panicking.
It's just that I'm afraid

10:23.884 --> 10:25.668
it's like a party; as soon as
one person leaves the party,

10:25.712 --> 10:27.496
another person decides it's okay
for them to leave the party,

10:27.539 --> 10:28.758
and before you know it,
the whole party's over.

10:28.802 --> 10:29.803
And you devoted 12 years
of your life

10:29.846 --> 10:31.108
to a certain type of party,

10:31.152 --> 10:31.892
and it's not gonna end
like this!

10:34.851 --> 10:36.723
- Sorry.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.115
Hey...

10:38.159 --> 10:39.290
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you,

10:39.334 --> 10:40.814
I just had a question.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.729
If this has anything to do
with the fact that

10:42.772 --> 10:44.731
I won't let anybody touch
Colin Robinson's body,

10:44.774 --> 10:47.298
yet I myself have not been
down to the basement

10:47.342 --> 10:49.823
to pay my respects,
I can answer that.

10:49.866 --> 10:52.782
There's nothing down there.
Only a bag of skin.

10:52.826 --> 10:56.264
Plus I find that kind of
sentimental gesture

10:56.307 --> 10:57.613
fucking tawdry.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.486
No, no, that wasn't it.
I wasn't--

11:01.530 --> 11:04.011
No, it was just a random
question that I was--

11:04.054 --> 11:07.754
What do you think about England?
Is it a cool place to live?

11:07.797 --> 11:11.888
No, it is absolutely not
a cool place to live.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.760
- Why not?
- You want to know a story about

11:13.803 --> 11:17.067
- England and the English way?
- Yeah.

11:17.111 --> 11:20.680
- I used to be a member
of a club.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.203
The Sherwood Club of London.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.596
My father was a member of a club

11:24.640 --> 11:26.947
called the Sherwood Club
of London.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.557
His father was a member
of a club

11:28.600 --> 11:31.429
called the Sherwood Club
of London.

11:31.473 --> 11:34.084
- You get where I'm going
with this?
- I think so.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.521
Anyway, treachery was afoot,
and I was expelled

11:36.565 --> 11:38.741
from the Sherwood Club
of London.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.875
The decision was unanimous.

11:41.918 --> 11:46.053
So I left the UK and came here,

11:46.096 --> 11:47.489
to the New World.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.926
To the land of opportunity,

11:49.970 --> 11:52.799
where men--
and, I'm told, some women--

11:52.842 --> 11:55.453
can be kings
of their own castle.

11:55.497 --> 11:59.022
Where industrialists can rub
shoulders with chimney sweeps.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.285
My late friend Walt Whitman
said to me,

12:01.329 --> 12:04.071
-"You'd better put
that away, Laszlo..."
- So you're saying

12:04.114 --> 12:08.423
you would never, ever
go back to England.

12:08.466 --> 12:09.772
Yes, I am.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.469
- I would never, ever,

12:11.513 --> 12:14.342
ever, ever, ever

12:14.385 --> 12:15.735
go back to England.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.127
Well, there you have it.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.738
- Oh.

12:18.781 --> 12:19.826
- There's the bell.
Five minutes, vamps.

12:19.869 --> 12:20.783
Time to get back
to the portrait.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.567
Tell him to fuck off.

12:22.611 --> 12:23.960
- I'm busy here.
- All right.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.223
Plus, that conversation
about my homeland

12:26.267 --> 12:27.964
has given me the pip.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.879
- Of course.
- I shall need ten minutes
to recover.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.455
Hel-lo.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.762
Your English is
coming along nicely.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.981
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
Hey...

12:45.025 --> 12:46.591
You see?
You have made progress.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.072
I have to remind myself
that vampires always make

12:49.116 --> 12:51.858
these grandiose plans,
but they never see them through.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.685
- Everything's gonna be A-ok...
It's a map.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.209
It's a cape.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.080
- It's a mape!
I'll tell you what,

12:57.124 --> 13:00.170
- world travel looks good
on you, Nandor.
- Thank you.

13:00.214 --> 13:03.260
- Oh, hi, Guillermo. Good news.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.437
She is an expert on
international vampire travel.

13:06.481 --> 13:09.919
It's true. I book all the trips
for the Vampiric Council.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.356
- Really the only fun part
of my job.
- Yes.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.097
Anyway, we figured out
all the details

13:14.141 --> 13:15.838
- so you don't have to
worry about a thing.
- No.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.319
I mean, I don't think
you've thought of everything.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.886
- I mean, what about...
- The coffin? Super easy.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.409
All you need is international
bill of lading,

13:21.452 --> 13:22.627
- and that's kind of it.
- Really?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.064
Here's a tip.
- Yes?

13:24.107 --> 13:26.936
Put your ancestral soil
in your Jansport

13:26.980 --> 13:30.070
so it's always on your back, and
you can just lie down anywhere.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.507
- What's a Jansport?
- It's a backpack.
- It's a backpack.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.379
- It's a very popular backpack.
- It's a children's backpack.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.251
That's smart.
That's very smart.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.861
- Anyone could have
thought of that.
Let's celebrate.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.170
Master, listen to me.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.911
Nadja and Laszlo
aren't leaving after all.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.869
So you don't have to worry
about being all by yourself.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.263
But I'm excited
for this trip now.

13:49.306 --> 13:52.396
It's gonna be a real eat,
prey, love kind journey for me.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.616
What do you mean?
You're gonna pray?

13:54.659 --> 13:56.705
Well, how am I gonna eat if
I don't prey on people, dummy?

13:56.748 --> 14:00.535
Now, you must travel
by railway and always at night.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.971
It's the only way
to stay safe.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.452
Plus, it's usually much cheaper.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.541
Oh, I'm so excited.

14:06.584 --> 14:09.544
I cannot wait to see
all the wonders of the world.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.154
The Colossus of Rhodes.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.591
The Hanging Gardens
of Babylon.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.550
The beautiful unmarred face
of the Sphinx.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.900
Ah, cheers to that!

14:17.944 --> 14:19.293
- We should finish our portrait.
Come on, everybody!

14:19.336 --> 14:20.294
- Shall we?
- Absolutely.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.469
And there are so many

14:21.512 --> 14:23.036
wonderful vampire hosts

14:23.079 --> 14:24.515
- I can hook you up with.
- Oh, please.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.997
You know, you spend
your whole life wanting

14:28.041 --> 14:30.695
to shoot in New York;
Brooklyn in this case.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.262
We were at Steiner Studios.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.656
And then you find yourself
so far from your family,

14:34.699 --> 14:36.745
- it gets kind of lonely.
- I have to say something.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.226
- I'm sorry, Donal Logue.
- Quite all right.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.750
I know that we're all
a little bit shaken up

14:41.793 --> 14:43.795
- by the death of Colin Robinson.
Speak for yourself.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.885
I'm as dry as a nun's doodah.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.756
Well, regardless,
we have to remember

14:47.799 --> 14:50.019
that there's the family
that you're born into,

14:50.063 --> 14:51.760
and then there's
your chosen family.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.501
That's what we are.

14:53.544 --> 14:56.112
We're a chosen family,
and it's a rare thing...

14:56.156 --> 14:57.505
I've been offered
a job in England,

14:57.548 --> 14:58.810
- and I want to move there!
- Whoo-hoo!

14:58.854 --> 15:00.290
- Over my dead body.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.031
Well, it seems everyone's
getting into it now.

15:02.075 --> 15:05.121
I have decided to leave
the island of Staten,

15:05.165 --> 15:09.473
travel the world and
rediscover my groove.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.301
- You are so selfish, Laszlo!
She's right.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.609
I made a vow never to return
to that cack house

15:14.652 --> 15:16.089
ever, ever again.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.308
- But why?
- You know why.

15:18.352 --> 15:21.790
- The British are a pack of
classist wankers.
Here, here.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.271
And those fuckers
expelled me

15:24.314 --> 15:25.837
- from the Sherwood...
- From the Sherwood Club.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.752
Yes, I know. You have told me
so many times.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.363
Yeah, I've told you
so many times,

15:29.406 --> 15:31.713
but I've never told you why.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.454
And now I will.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.890
I always thought
it was because of

15:34.934 --> 15:35.978
all the whores and the whoring.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.110
They don't give a fuck about

15:37.153 --> 15:38.676
whores and whoring, my darling.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.765
They didn't even care
that I was a vampire.

15:40.809 --> 15:43.986
What they did object to,
however, was the fact

15:44.030 --> 15:46.249
that I fell in love
and eventually married

15:46.293 --> 15:50.601
the most beautiful,
simple girl.

15:50.645 --> 15:53.517
A girl with no surname,

15:53.561 --> 15:56.477
no social standing.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.262
They actually called her
a peasant girl.

15:59.306 --> 16:04.050
A girl from a tiny village
on a dirt island

16:04.093 --> 16:05.442
in the Mediterranean.

16:05.486 --> 16:08.968
That girl is the most
beautiful girl

16:09.011 --> 16:10.578
I have ever known.

16:10.621 --> 16:14.277
That girl's name--
yes, my darling--

16:14.321 --> 16:18.064
- Is my name?
- Is your name. Nadja.

16:18.107 --> 16:21.110
- Oh, snap.
- Snap, indeed, Donal.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.808
But, my dark baby,

16:23.852 --> 16:26.115
I will be returning to England
to assume a position

16:26.159 --> 16:28.596
on the Supreme Vampiric Council.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.119
Wait, what?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.556
We would be going back
as the tip of the tops

16:32.600 --> 16:33.862
of the upper classes.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.516
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.649
Well, that changes pretty much
fucking everything.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.609
- Count me in.
No, no, Laszlo,

16:41.652 --> 16:43.741
You made a lifelong vow
to never go back

16:43.785 --> 16:45.830
- to that shithole, remember?
- Didn't you hear what
she just said?

16:45.874 --> 16:47.658
We're gonna rule
the fucking place.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.138
Rule Britannia!

16:52.794 --> 16:54.926
- Oh, okay, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Now I'm ready.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.537
Now I am ready.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.713
- So romantic. Great!
Oh, yeah, get some.

16:58.756 --> 17:02.021
It is decided, we will all
move on from this place

17:02.064 --> 17:03.848
- and regroup elsewhere.
- Yes. Whoo-hoo!

17:03.892 --> 17:06.199
I think we should all
just take a second, breathe.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.331
You know,
just take a deep breath.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.072
And, I mean, the portrait's
not even done, so we could...

17:10.116 --> 17:11.682
No, it's almost done.
- What?

17:11.726 --> 17:13.032
And that's that.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.077
So, you're all free
to go about doing

17:15.121 --> 17:16.600
whatever the hell it was
you were doing before.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.907
Plus, I just got a text
from my agent

17:18.950 --> 17:21.562
that I have to do a self-tape
for a CBS pilot,

17:21.605 --> 17:22.867
so Logue out.

17:25.218 --> 17:28.047
Always a drama with
this little rascal.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.353
I will fix.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.095
You know, usually when
someone is upset,

17:33.139 --> 17:34.705
they go to their own room,

17:34.749 --> 17:37.186
but I understand why
you would come to my room,

17:37.230 --> 17:39.101
as it is a far superior
room to yours.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.016
Which probably makes you feel
even more depressed.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.888
- Is this your attempt
at cheering me up?
- Guillermo...

17:43.932 --> 17:47.544
You want us to go through this
one more time? Hmm?

17:47.588 --> 17:49.329
It is a very dangerous world
out there.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.114
You're joking, right? It's me
who's been protecting you!

17:52.158 --> 17:54.029
So what, you shooed away some
assassins; who gives a shit?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.683
If it wasn't for me,
you would be dead by now.

17:55.726 --> 17:58.120
If not by assassins
then by my very own hands

17:58.164 --> 17:59.861
because I am,
and I will remind you,

17:59.904 --> 18:02.733
by birth and lineage,
a vampire killer.

18:02.777 --> 18:06.172
And the only reason
you're alive is because...

18:06.215 --> 18:07.956
I let you live.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.049
What did you just say?

18:14.093 --> 18:18.053
I said, the only reason
you're alive

18:18.097 --> 18:20.142
is because I

18:20.186 --> 18:24.581
let you live.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.934
My poor, dear thing.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.111
You forgot that
we hypnotized you

18:32.154 --> 18:34.896
to make it physically impossible
for you to harm me

18:34.939 --> 18:36.724
or any or your masters.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.247
Do you remember that? Hmm?

18:38.291 --> 18:41.598
No, because we used hypnosis.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.339
Hypnosis doesn't work on me.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.907
I just let you think it did
so you wouldn't feel weak.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.910
I never feel weak,
my furry little friend!

18:53.306 --> 18:56.135
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.397
Master, your-your sword
needs polishing.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.963
It does?

18:59.007 --> 19:01.270
- Hey!

19:02.228 --> 19:05.187
- Plancha!
- Don't you dare!

19:05.231 --> 19:06.971
Ow.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.412
Once a familiar,
always a familiar!

19:19.201 --> 19:20.333
Uh-uh-uh.

19:22.378 --> 19:25.120
You almost hit John!

19:29.298 --> 19:31.518
Yes, yes, finally.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.172
This is what
I've been waiting for.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.913
- What?
- Put the crucifix away,
Guillermo.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.611
You have passed the test.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.136
What test?

19:41.180 --> 19:44.183
I have been worried that you
have been going a little soft.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.795
But tonight, you have
proved to me finally

19:47.838 --> 19:50.711
that you can take care
of yourself.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.713
And more importantly,

19:52.756 --> 19:55.672
you can take care of me.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.066
Guillermo de la Cruz,

19:58.109 --> 20:02.897
will you do me the honor...

20:02.940 --> 20:06.379
of accompanying me on my journey
around the world?

20:06.422 --> 20:09.469
If you're scared of me
right now...

20:09.512 --> 20:11.732
If you accompany me
on this journey,

20:11.775 --> 20:15.736
when we arrive at the banks
of the River Tigris

20:15.779 --> 20:18.521
in my homeland of Al-Qolnadar,

20:18.565 --> 20:21.263
you will take a knee,

20:21.307 --> 20:23.918
and I will make you...

20:23.961 --> 20:26.225
a vampire.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.576
- Really?
- My word

20:29.619 --> 20:31.447
is my bond.

20:32.796 --> 20:36.365
Then yes. Yes, of course
I'll go with you, Master.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.890
There will be plenty of time
for that kind of thing.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.328
- Right.
- Well...

20:42.371 --> 20:44.678
you should go,
start making arrangements.

20:44.721 --> 20:45.896
Yes.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.769
Let our great journey commence!

20:49.944 --> 20:52.338
That little fucker can
really move when he wants to.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.995
Yeah, I'm gonna miss
this house, but...

20:58.039 --> 21:00.259
definitely won't miss
cleaning it.

21:00.302 --> 21:03.436
It'll be sad to say bye
to Nadja and Laszlo.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.264
They're off
on a big adventure now,

21:05.307 --> 21:07.048
so I'm really happy for them.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.311
Don't you even fucking dare!

21:09.355 --> 21:12.183
But the real thing
I'm looking forward to is...

21:12.227 --> 21:16.362
traveling the whole world
with my Nand-- master.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.147
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

21:20.540 --> 21:22.106
- Master.
- Yes?

21:22.150 --> 21:24.108
You need to hurry up.
I still have to help

21:24.152 --> 21:26.110
Nadja and Laszlo load
their coffin into the boat.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.765
And then you and I are catching
a midnight train.

21:28.809 --> 21:32.073
Why are you helping them when my
ancestral soil needs scooping?

21:32.116 --> 21:33.596
Because it's the last time
I can say goodbye to them.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.859
- I thought you'd understand.
- Oh, Guillermo.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.818
Fine, I will allow it.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.907
But don't think for one second
I'll be getting into the habit

21:39.950 --> 21:41.909
- of scooping my own soil.
- No, of course not.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.650
Oh. Can you take my luggage
to the train station?

21:43.693 --> 21:45.216
I don't want to carry it
to the dock

21:45.260 --> 21:46.479
and then have
to carry it back...

21:46.522 --> 21:48.698
Hey! What,
am I working for you now?

21:50.265 --> 21:51.353
I'm kidding, Guillermo.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.833
I will take your bag for you.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.661
Okay, gracias.

21:54.704 --> 21:57.446
- Knock, knock,
Mr. Relentless.
- Hi.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.406
Hello.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

22:00.449 --> 22:03.713
- Thank you.
- I got you a little card.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.367
"Bon voyage."

22:05.411 --> 22:07.151
Those are
the wraiths' signatures.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.197
- Oh.
- Some of them
don't know how to write,

22:09.240 --> 22:11.634
and others once did
but have long since forgotten,

22:11.678 --> 22:13.636
so I just dipped
their claws in ink

22:13.680 --> 22:15.159
and let them go at it.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.944
Smart.

22:16.987 --> 22:18.119
Thank you.

22:18.162 --> 22:20.121
Should we hug now, or...?

22:20.164 --> 22:22.558
I think it would be too much.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.865
- Okay.
- Nandor, I have come
to bid you adieu.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.128
You are a vampire
I have known for a while now,

22:27.171 --> 22:29.348
and now our time together
has ended.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.697
Cheers! Bye! Ha!

22:30.740 --> 22:32.916
Nadja, Laszlo, <i>vámonos!</i>

22:32.960 --> 22:34.353
We have to go!

22:34.396 --> 22:35.658
Don't you dare shout at me,
Guillermo!

22:35.702 --> 22:37.181
I could suck out
all of your bodily fluids

22:37.225 --> 22:38.357
in less than two seconds.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.316
- Not gonna miss that.
- Laszlo?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.665
Where are you?
It's time to get to...

22:42.709 --> 22:44.754
Oh.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.930
What were you doing
in the basement, my dear?

22:46.974 --> 22:49.672
Nothing. Just taking care
of some business.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.066
Oh, my sweet love.

22:52.109 --> 22:54.068
Were you finally saying goodbye
to the decaying corpse

22:54.111 --> 22:55.852
of your very dead friend
Colin Robinson?

22:55.896 --> 22:57.376
Something like that.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.812
Are you okay?
Do you need a bit more time?

22:58.855 --> 23:00.248
Not at all. I feel fine.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.684
Let's rock and roll.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.904
We're missing
three boxes of porn.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.916
- Whoo-hoo! Guillermo, my things.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.484
- Coming.
- Ah, smell the sea.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.486
I do love a journey.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.879
- And I went ahead and downloaded

23:22.923 --> 23:24.751
all the seasons
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

23:24.794 --> 23:26.535
Thank you very much, Guillermo.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.929
It has been... nice.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.496
Yeah.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.715
My darling, I will see you

23:32.759 --> 23:35.631
when we are kissing the ground
of your native land

23:35.675 --> 23:38.591
and make love on the bones
of those who scorned you.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.636
Safe passage, my darling.

23:42.333 --> 23:45.685
- Are you in?
- Yes. Lock me up.

23:45.728 --> 23:48.165
Right. Now, come on,
don't fuck about, get that in.

23:48.209 --> 23:51.168
Why do you have water and food
if you can't even eat it?

23:51.212 --> 23:52.953
It's Oreos and Pedialyte.

23:52.996 --> 23:55.129
This stuff's worth its weight
in gold where I come from.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.044
I can barter that
and get anything I want.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.350
Makes sense. Well, this is it.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.396
- Indeed.
- All right.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.658
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:02.702 --> 24:03.833
Right.

24:03.877 --> 24:05.400
Safe fare.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.706
You, too.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.447
It's a lot of Oreos.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.796
Make sure
you look after my wife.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.581
What? Aah! No! No, no, no, no!

24:12.625 --> 24:14.583
- No, no, no!

24:14.627 --> 24:16.672
What the fuck?! Master!

24:16.716 --> 24:17.934
Wait for me!

24:20.110 --> 24:23.287
Help! Let me out!
Let me out, Laszlo!

24:23.331 --> 24:25.812
Laszlo, please don't!
Hello! Hello?

24:26.813 --> 24:28.771
Hey...

24:31.339 --> 24:33.472
All aboard!

24:34.821 --> 24:37.345
Guillermo...!

24:38.738 --> 24:40.174
You coming or staying?

24:53.143 --> 24:55.276
<i>My dearest Nadja,</i>

24:55.319 --> 24:58.584
<i>you must be deucedly cross
with me for my subterfuge.</i>

24:58.627 --> 25:01.848
<i>But you have Gizmo at your side,</i>

25:01.891 --> 25:04.154
<i>if he has not expired
or drowned in his own filth</i>

25:04.198 --> 25:06.417
<i>during the transatlantic crossing.</i>

25:06.461 --> 25:09.203
<i>I did cut a small hole
in the bottom of the coffin,</i>

25:09.246 --> 25:12.336
<i>so if he is
either accurate or persistent,</i>

25:12.380 --> 25:14.556
<i>he should be fine.</i>

25:14.600 --> 25:16.253
<i>But I digress.</i>

25:17.777 --> 25:20.693
<i>Guillermo is
a damn good bodyguard.</i>

25:20.736 --> 25:22.259
<i>He will keep you safe.</i>

25:23.652 --> 25:25.654
<i>But the truth is, my darling,</i>

25:25.698 --> 25:28.527
<i>you don't need anyone
to keep you safe.</i>

25:28.570 --> 25:30.529
Okay, so,
this is my trinkets case.

25:30.572 --> 25:33.053
<i>Over these past
200 or 300 years,</i>

25:33.096 --> 25:36.230
- Hurry up! <i>
- you have grown into a strong,</i>

25:36.273 --> 25:39.059
<i>bold, independent woman
of the world.</i>

25:39.102 --> 25:42.497
<i>It is a strange and dangerous
netherworld we inhabit,</i>

25:42.541 --> 25:45.631
<i>and I once thought you
too weak and defenseless</i>

25:45.674 --> 25:47.633
<i>to navigate it on your own,</i>

25:47.676 --> 25:50.505
<i>and that you needed me about
at all times</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:52.246
<i>to take care of you.</i>

25:52.289 --> 25:55.945
<i>But that is no longer true,
were it ever so.</i>

25:55.989 --> 25:57.251
Um...

25:57.294 --> 26:00.341
safe passage, Colin Robinson.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.039
Not much more to say.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.302
What's that...

26:06.303 --> 26:07.522
Oh, my...

26:07.566 --> 26:09.568
What the fuck?

26:10.830 --> 26:13.136
- What?

26:13.180 --> 26:15.791
- Shit. <i>
- There are, it seems,</i>

26:15.835 --> 26:17.619
<i>others in our world...</i>

26:17.663 --> 26:19.099
What's this shit?

26:19.142 --> 26:21.623
<i>...whose future
is far less certain,</i>

26:21.667 --> 26:23.538
<i>whose existence</i>

26:23.582 --> 26:27.673
<i>is even more terrifying
and mysterious than our own...</i>

26:28.891 --> 26:33.069
<i>...who actually are weak
and defenseless,</i>

26:33.113 --> 26:37.639
<i>- who need protection and care.</i>

26:37.683 --> 26:39.510

28:17.391 --> 28:19.045
She has changed my life.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.272
<i>We're not safe here.</i>

28:31.187 --> 28:32.362
We don't really
live in this world.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.016
We feed off of it.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.149
<i>Aliens.</i>

28:36.192 --> 28:37.541
Mother of God!

28:38.717 --> 28:40.327
How have you
not gone insane?

28:41.632 --> 28:43.678
Once you sell your soul,
it's gone.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.332
<i>Boom!</i>

28:45.375 --> 28:46.550
<i>It's breaking
all the rules.</i>

28:48.074 --> 28:49.118
And I'm here for that.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.519
<i>It happened
pretty fast.</i>

28:58.562 --> 29:00.260
<i>The world
has changed.</i>

29:00.303 --> 29:01.827
<i>His survivor's classified.</i>

29:01.870 --> 29:03.393
Nobody can know
about him.

29:05.308 --> 29:06.745
People are going
to have to pick sides.

29:08.224 --> 29:09.835
I think it's going
to get worse

29:09.878 --> 29:10.966
<i>before it gets better.</i>

29:11.967 --> 29:12.968
Run!

29:15.188 --> 29:16.493
I imagine
that you attract

29:16.537 --> 29:17.799
quite a bit
of attention.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.279
You know, more than before.
That's for sure.

29:25.546 --> 29:26.765
<i>Hillary.</i>

29:26.808 --> 29:27.896
Hillary, wake up.

29:30.681 --> 29:31.682
I'm sorry.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.249
For what?
