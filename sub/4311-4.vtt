31:43.975 --> 31:46.319
And Mr. Melton's phone was never used

31:46.344 --> 31:47.851
after the 23rd, either.

31:48.343 --> 31:49.783
No, ma'am.

31:50.316 --> 31:53.038
Just the pinging to the
tower for the next few days.

31:59.095 --> 32:01.095
Anything else on the Holden front?

32:01.130 --> 32:02.963
Just the more people I talk to,

32:02.965 --> 32:05.311
the more narrow his window
of opportunity becomes.

32:05.559 --> 32:06.562
But not impossible.

32:06.829 --> 32:08.662
No, but improbable.

32:09.882 --> 32:12.806
I mean, I still believe he had the motive,

32:12.808 --> 32:14.224
but I don't know.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.977
He's a confounding son of a bitch,

32:16.979 --> 32:20.694
but it just seems like he's
too honest for his own good.

32:20.719 --> 32:23.420
Whereas Trey, feels like
he's trying too hard.

32:23.675 --> 32:24.908
Too hard to do what?

32:24.933 --> 32:26.194
To pin it on Daniel.

32:28.129 --> 32:29.124
Okay.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.249
I got the warrant.

32:38.058 --> 32:39.288
All right.

32:41.155 --> 32:44.343
Still doesn't mean that
Holden didn't kill Hanna Dean.

32:45.522 --> 32:46.757
Of course it doesn't.

32:46.809 --> 32:49.171
Could be two separate crimes, for sure.

32:49.506 --> 32:50.624
Three.

32:51.514 --> 32:54.038
Right. Three.

33:10.025 --> 33:12.559
He was here. Left a note.

33:12.643 --> 33:13.897
Is that right?

33:15.249 --> 33:17.546
He took the new clothes
I got him for his trip...

33:18.596 --> 33:19.929
For his move.

33:20.501 --> 33:22.146
Well, that's good.

33:22.741 --> 33:23.940
Is it?

33:25.085 --> 33:26.257
What do you mean?

33:26.547 --> 33:28.819
I don't know what language
you speak anymore, Ted.

33:30.663 --> 33:32.186
Well, I'm not real sure

33:32.221 --> 33:34.124
what you're saying right now, Janet.

33:34.765 --> 33:37.866
"That's good"? I don't
know what that means.

33:38.652 --> 33:41.402
That's good that he
has new clothes to wear?

33:41.564 --> 33:43.194
That's good that he's leaving?

33:43.819 --> 33:45.532
That's good that you didn't have to see him

33:45.591 --> 33:47.249
'cause he snuck over here
during the middle of the day

33:47.274 --> 33:48.983
while you were at work?

33:52.228 --> 33:54.374
That's good that he has
some new clothes, Janet.

33:54.849 --> 33:56.049
Well, that's good.

34:00.342 --> 34:03.311
Did you ever ask Teddy
about his part in all this?

34:03.819 --> 34:05.085
I asked Daniel.

34:05.137 --> 34:06.897
About Teddy's part?

34:06.929 --> 34:08.007
Yes.

34:08.664 --> 34:09.983
What did he say?

34:11.061 --> 34:12.259
He didn't, really.

34:12.311 --> 34:13.976
Of course he didn't.

34:20.295 --> 34:22.905
There was a lot of pressure put on Teddy

34:22.937 --> 34:24.701
to file assault charges against Daniel,

34:25.170 --> 34:26.303
but he didn't.

34:27.235 --> 34:28.366
Of course he didn't.

34:29.578 --> 34:31.092
Well, good for Teddy.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.581
Janet, I know he's your son

34:35.108 --> 34:37.022
I know he's had a troubled life...

34:37.047 --> 34:38.045
Troubled?

34:38.449 --> 34:40.398
Difficult, tragic...

34:40.422 --> 34:42.121
Whatever word you want to use,

34:42.174 --> 34:43.956
but he rendered my son unconscious.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.458
Do you understand that?

34:46.217 --> 34:49.463
So I'm not gonna
apologize for being worried

34:49.465 --> 34:52.099
or even afraid for the safety of my family,

34:52.134 --> 34:53.358
no matter who it is.

34:54.382 --> 34:56.014
So what are you gonna do, Ted?

34:57.940 --> 34:59.085
Right now...

35:01.391 --> 35:03.341
I'm gonna finish this kitchen.

35:07.032 --> 35:08.816
Can't wait.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.554
I'm proud of you, Daniel.

35:38.464 --> 35:39.835
For what?

35:40.156 --> 35:41.655
For trying.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.263
[ Sighs ]

35:52.059 --> 35:53.772
I saw Jon today.

35:55.080 --> 35:59.917
He told me about George Melton and Daggett.

36:01.465 --> 36:04.374
He loves you... Jon.

36:07.011 --> 36:10.452
I'm really sorry that you have
to go through this again, Danny.

36:10.477 --> 36:12.310
Do you love him?

36:13.686 --> 36:15.182
I do.

36:15.475 --> 36:16.561
But not enough?

36:17.764 --> 36:19.186
I don't know.

36:20.397 --> 36:22.264
I'm not sure what enough is.

36:24.038 --> 36:26.366
I thought I loved someone once.

36:28.132 --> 36:29.585
Maybe you did.

36:30.550 --> 36:32.873
I thought she could save me.

36:33.063 --> 36:35.225
I thought that she was my savior.

Girl Jesus.

36:40.679 --> 36:43.155
We all do that sometimes.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.257
I got it all mixed up.

36:46.889 --> 36:48.460
And it wasn't love. It was...

36:50.809 --> 36:52.044
Insanity.

36:53.811 --> 36:56.757
You're gonna get help where you're going.

36:57.825 --> 36:59.350
Like Humpty Dumpty?

Kind of.

And who will I be when they
put me back together again?
