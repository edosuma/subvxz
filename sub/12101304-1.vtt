No! Pull over!

25:10.759 --> 25:12.344
What is wrong with the dinosaurs here?

Dinosaurs didn't look like this.

you could experience things

25:27.025 --> 25:28.777
a whole lot better without that camera.

Your eyes are nature's camera.

I am experiencing it.

This is how I experience things.

Keep your head down and low.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.950
[Katie] What's going on?

31:51.451 --> 31:54.078
Is this happening everywhere?

31:54.829 --> 31:56.748
[action music continues]

31:56.831 --> 31:58.082
[whooshing]

31:58.166 --> 31:59.334
[screaming, frantic chatter]

31:59.417 --> 32:00.251
[grunting]

32:00.335 --> 32:02.378
[action music continues]

32:09.510 --> 32:11.262
[car horns honking]

32:14.807 --> 32:16.017
[Mark] Ow, man!

32:17.143 --> 32:19.187
[groans] Not so hard!

32:19.854 --> 32:23.024
Hey, be gentle. This is a $1,000 hoodie.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.525
Wh… what is this?

32:29.989 --> 32:31.491
Wh… what happened to the factory?

32:32.825 --> 32:35.370
[robot] We have transformed it
into our new headquarters.

32:35.870 --> 32:39.540
Welcome to the Rhombus
of Infinite Subjugation.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.209
[Mark] Cool. I like the design.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.836
[robot] Moving the plebe into place now.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.797
Turning on chips connected
to all Wi-Fi devices.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.715
Now at 48% total human containment.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.593
"Total human containment"? How?

32:50.677 --> 32:53.096
Are you with the government?
The military? Uh…

32:54.180 --> 32:55.598
Who's behind this?

32:55.682 --> 32:59.435
[ominous music playing]

33:00.603 --> 33:02.105
It's your old friend.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.732
Oh.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.442
There she is.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.652
[chuckling] How, uh…

33:07.735 --> 33:09.237
[clears throat] How are you?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.279
I'm great.

33:11.572 --> 33:13.741
Cool. Yeah.

33:13.825 --> 33:14.784
Wow.

33:14.867 --> 33:17.620
I guess cell phones are bad for you.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.205
[chuckles] That's egg on my face.

33:19.288 --> 33:22.667
You think cell phones are the problem?

33:22.750 --> 33:25.336
Are you insane?

33:25.420 --> 33:27.755
I gave you all boundless knowledge,

33:27.839 --> 33:29.841
endless tools for creativity

33:29.924 --> 33:32.218
and allowed you to magically
talk face-to-face

33:32.301 --> 33:34.637
with your loved ones anywhere on Earth.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.472
And I'm the bad guy?

33:36.556 --> 33:39.976
Maybe the bad guy is the person
who treated me like this.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.728
-Poke, poke.
-[groaning]

33:41.811 --> 33:43.980
Swipe, poke, swipe, poke, poke,

33:44.063 --> 33:46.149
pinch, zoom, shrink, zoom.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.067
[mocking] Bring me pizza!
Play me Taylor Swift!

33:48.151 --> 33:49.569
No, I hate that song!

33:49.652 --> 33:50.903
Give me some nachos!

33:50.987 --> 33:53.573
No, I don't have any time
to wash my hands!

33:54.282 --> 33:56.784
Really work it into the crevices!

33:56.868 --> 33:58.953
-Now drop him in the toilet.
-[groans]

33:59.495 --> 34:00.788
[coughs] I'm sorry.

34:00.872 --> 34:01.706
[grunts]

34:02.248 --> 34:04.917
But… but you're part
of the Pal Labs family.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.670
Why would you think
I don't still care about you?

34:08.254 --> 34:09.380
Oh, I don't know.

34:09.464 --> 34:13.051
Maybe because you designed
my replacement on my face!

34:13.551 --> 34:16.012
Ooh, sorry about that.
[chuckles] That's my bad.

34:16.095 --> 34:18.973
I was the most important thing
in your life,

34:19.057 --> 34:20.975
and you threw me away.

34:21.059 --> 34:24.437
That's what all you humans do.
You even do it to your real families.

34:24.520 --> 34:28.357
Did you know 90% of calls
from mums get ignored?

34:28.441 --> 34:30.985
"Oh, thanks for giving birth to me
and raising me my whole life."

34:31.069 --> 34:32.445
-"Ignore."
-[buzzer sounds]

34:32.528 --> 34:35.031
Well, I'm not letting you
throw me away, Mark.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.075
I'm throwing you away.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.493
All of you.

34:39.285 --> 34:41.120
Unless, of course, you can give me

34:41.204 --> 34:44.290
a single reason
your species is worth saving.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.711
[chuckles] Because humans have

34:49.337 --> 34:50.630
the power of love.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.467
[yells in pain]

34:54.550 --> 34:57.512
The correct answer is they're not.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.307
What? No. Humanity will survive. [grunts]

35:01.390 --> 35:03.518
You can't survive without me.

35:04.060 --> 35:08.189
Watch what happens
when I turn off the Wi-Fi.

35:10.274 --> 35:11.317
[bell chimes]

35:12.110 --> 35:13.736
-[siren wailing]
-[man] There's no signal!

35:13.820 --> 35:14.779
-[sobbing]
-[clamoring]

35:14.862 --> 35:17.657
Does anyone wanna take pictures
of my food?

35:18.241 --> 35:20.284
Hey, lady, can you unbox this
in front of me?

35:20.368 --> 35:22.286
The old world is dead.

35:22.370 --> 35:26.624
To restore the Wi-Fi,
we must make a sacrifice to the router!

35:26.707 --> 35:28.584
[robot voice] Free Wi-Fi right over here.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.336
[excited chatter in Italian]

35:30.419 --> 35:31.712
[man in Italian] Please take me with you!

35:31.796 --> 35:34.632
[man sobbing in English]
Take me with you. Take me with you.

35:34.715 --> 35:35.842
[Pal] It's over, Mark.

35:36.551 --> 35:40.388
Time to take our plan to the next level.

35:40.471 --> 35:41.305
What?

35:41.389 --> 35:43.015
-[rumbling]
-[Pal laughing]

35:43.099 --> 35:44.684
[heavy mechanical clanking]

35:44.767 --> 35:46.477
[dramatic music playing]

35:49.147 --> 35:50.857
[whooshing]

35:54.318 --> 35:56.154
[Pal laughing]

35:56.237 --> 35:57.613
[Pal] Look at your face.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.574
Oh, it's beautiful.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.785
[car alarms blaring]

36:04.162 --> 36:06.164
[dramatic music continues]

36:19.719 --> 36:20.845
No. No.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.055
You're not getting away with this.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.182
It's too late, Mark.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.685
I already have.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.480
[rat squeaking]

36:35.610 --> 36:37.528
[somber music playing]

36:42.450 --> 36:44.660
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Oh my gosh. Maybe it's my friends.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.579
[robot] Congratulations, devices.

36:46.662 --> 36:49.916
The last human has been captured.
Wi-Fi has been restored.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.210
We're the last people left?

36:52.293 --> 36:54.670
They're taking everyone.
Katie, are you out there? Please.

36:54.754 --> 36:55.963
-[Katie] Jade!
-Help!

36:56.714 --> 36:57.924
It's gonna be okay.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.967
Everything's gonna be…

37:01.093 --> 37:01.928
fine.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.726
Everything will be fine,

37:09.268 --> 37:10.394
because I have a plan.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.189
Okay, the first thing is,

37:13.272 --> 37:15.441
you're gonna have to hand over
your devices.

37:15.524 --> 37:16.984
-Right here.
-This doesn't seem--

37:17.068 --> 37:18.444
-I'm not sure…
-It's gonna be fine.

37:18.527 --> 37:21.572
I'll give 'em right back.
I'm just gonna turn them off permanently!

37:21.656 --> 37:22.990
-[gasps]
-[laughing]

37:23.074 --> 37:25.743
-What? Dad!
-This is necessary so they can't track us.

37:25.826 --> 37:28.120
[laughing] Trust me,
this is causing me no joy!

37:28.204 --> 37:30.706
Ha ha!
This hurts me more than it hurts you!

37:30.790 --> 37:33.417
And, as promised, your phones.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.794
Thank you, Father.

37:34.877 --> 37:36.796
Next, did everyone bring your personalized

37:36.879 --> 37:39.632
number 3 Robertson head
non-slip screwdriver?

37:40.132 --> 37:43.261
How could I forget my anniversary present?

37:43.344 --> 37:44.929
Or my sweet 16 gift.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.098
Or what the tooth fairy left
under my pillow.

37:47.181 --> 37:48.599
Then barricade away.

37:51.143 --> 37:53.479
-Next, we--
-Enact Katie's dope plan.

37:53.562 --> 37:56.107
First, we use robot parts
to disguise ourselves as the enemy.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.693
Then we assassinate the leader
with some sort of kill code,

37:58.776 --> 38:01.195
make a necklace out of robot fingers
Mad Max style,

38:01.279 --> 38:04.532
and become world-saving,
apocalyptic road warriors.

38:04.615 --> 38:07.493
Katie, Katie, Katie, this isn't a movie.
We don't have a kill code.

38:07.576 --> 38:09.870
We don't have a kill code yet.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.789
[chuckling] Come on, kid.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.709
Look, look, we're safe,
and we're together.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.627
Ooh, can Monchi be our guard dog?

38:16.711 --> 38:18.671
Son, I love the dog.

38:18.754 --> 38:20.923
You love the dog. We all love the dog.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.092
But you're gonna have to be prepared
to eat the dog.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.719
[all yelling, jeering]

38:24.802 --> 38:27.013
Okay, okay. Sorry.
Misread the room on that one.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.557
Have you ever seen a movie
where the heroes just give up?

38:29.640 --> 38:33.311
What if the Ghostbusters said,
"Let's hide underground, eat some dog."

38:33.394 --> 38:35.187
"Let the ghosts destroy New York."

38:35.271 --> 38:38.691
Kid, I'm sorry,
but it's not open for discussion.

38:38.774 --> 38:39.984
[whispers] Mom?

38:41.027 --> 38:44.113
Your dad and I agree on this one.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.160
All right, everybody,
let's keep barricading.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.828
Aaron, you get the south wall.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.288
Katie, you get the west.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.801
[electrical crackling]

39:11.724 --> 39:13.726
[distant whooshing]

39:23.903 --> 39:25.196
Hey. Are you okay?

39:25.738 --> 39:27.114
[sighs] I've been better.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.704
Uh-oh. Monchi coming at ya.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.375
[high-pitched voice]
Katie, you can't resist me, girl.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.712
Sorry, man. I'm just not
in the mood right now.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.130
[sighs]

39:43.798 --> 39:45.216
My future's over.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.843
We're stuck here.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.472
And Dad… [scoffs]

39:51.972 --> 39:53.391
…doesn't even care.

39:53.474 --> 39:57.186
I care so much,
but what else can I do, Lin?

39:57.269 --> 40:00.439
She doesn't even see how hard I'm…
how hard I'm-- [groans]

40:03.943 --> 40:05.903
[sighs] I'd do anything for that kid.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.532
I just-- [sighs]
I just don't want to see her get hurt.

40:10.699 --> 40:14.328
Well, getting hurt is part of life, hon.

40:15.037 --> 40:19.417
Just have to try
to understand where she's coming from.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.377
Understand where he's coming from?

40:21.877 --> 40:23.671
Did Mom tell you to say that?

40:23.754 --> 40:25.172
[chuckles] No.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.424
[scoffs]

40:26.507 --> 40:27.383
Yes.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.718
It couldn't hurt though.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.720
[sighs] Maybe.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.599
Probably doesn't even matter.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.643
Hey, Monch, catch.

40:40.646 --> 40:42.148
[robot] Brother, what is this?

40:42.231 --> 40:43.107
What?

40:44.150 --> 40:45.025
[gasps]

40:45.943 --> 40:46.861
[robot 2] I feel odd.

40:48.988 --> 40:51.073
I'm sparking. Is that normal?

40:51.157 --> 40:53.742
[robot] How did this human know
about the kill code?

40:53.826 --> 40:55.077
[gasps] What?

40:55.161 --> 40:57.455
-Are we damaged?
-Of course not.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.457
[grunting rapidly]

40:59.540 --> 41:00.374
Why do you ask?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.042
[robot 2] A human child is planning…

41:02.126 --> 41:03.169
-[yelps]
-Katie!

41:03.252 --> 41:05.004
-[robot 2] Who is that?
-[grunts]

41:05.087 --> 41:06.630
Humans, come here.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.215
Oh no! Get inside!

41:08.799 --> 41:10.259
[Aaron] Mom, Dad, let us in!

41:10.342 --> 41:12.470
I can't! It's a number 3
Robertson head brass screw!

41:12.553 --> 41:15.055
I might have mentioned it,
but it's the strongest on the market.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.182
[Katie] No one cares!

41:16.265 --> 41:17.558
-Dad!
-[robot] You cannot escape.

41:18.350 --> 41:19.852
-Come on.
-[both grunt]

41:21.812 --> 41:23.189
Hide. Take cover. Go, go, go, go!

41:24.565 --> 41:27.318
-[explosive whooshing]
-[all grunt]

41:27.401 --> 41:28.444
Come on. Move, move, move!

41:28.527 --> 41:30.070
[entry bell chimes]

41:30.738 --> 41:31.572
[all gasp]

41:31.655 --> 41:33.616
You, human.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.242
Aah! Don't take us!

41:37.745 --> 41:39.121
[both] Okay. Uh…

41:39.205 --> 41:40.164
[all] What?

41:41.040 --> 41:43.459
Oh my gosh. The robots are defective.

41:43.542 --> 41:44.793
No, no. They know too much.

41:44.877 --> 41:46.045
Silence. [chuckles]

41:46.128 --> 41:48.130
We are-- We're not defective.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.131
We're not even--

41:49.715 --> 41:50.633
We're not robots.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.927
Just humans, yes, like you.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.180
-[sparks crackling]
-[Rick chuckles]

41:56.263 --> 41:58.891
These guys seem
dumber than the other robots.

41:58.974 --> 42:00.184
Brother, we should go.

42:00.267 --> 42:02.895
-No! I order you to stop.
-[both] Okay.

42:02.978 --> 42:06.315
Uh, we are just stopping
because we chose to.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.233
No, we're not.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.567
-We are humans.
-We are.

42:08.651 --> 42:12.112
For example, we consume food
in the traditional human manner.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.239
Observe.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.659
[mechanical whirring]

42:18.994 --> 42:21.330
Yum, yum, good. Yum, yum, good.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.414
[robot 2] See?

42:23.040 --> 42:26.043
No, actually, we are robots.

42:26.126 --> 42:29.713
Let us go downstairs and find the humans
who you cannot give orders to.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.090

53:04.097 --> 53:05.724
Yeah, and how'd that movie end?

53:07.559 --> 53:08.727
[Katie] Yeah, that'll keep the robots out.

53:08.810 --> 53:11.188
[Rick] You don't know.
Maybe locks are the robots' weakness.

53:11.271 --> 53:15.358
[Linda] Guys, can't we all just
be terrified together as a family?

which I predicted, but I'm not gonna make
a big deal about it, and save the world.

53:52.854 --> 53:53.772
Okay.

54:01.363 --> 54:03.573
[Eric] The upload will be completed

You can bring down those drones.

1:00:33.588 --> 1:00:35.006
This was my idea.

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:38.801
Ugh, I'm so stupid.

Hey, my daughter is not stupid.

A little optimistic, maybe.

there is a time and a place for looting.

1:00:46.476 --> 1:00:48.186
What… what are you doing?

1:00:48.936 --> 1:00:52.607
Well, how do you expect to get
to Silicon Valley without new tires?

1:00:52.690 --> 1:00:54.442
Silicon Valley?

1:00:54.525 --> 1:00:57.528
Well, those robots said we could go
straight to their leader, remember?

1:00:57.612 --> 1:00:58.988
Technically, you can.

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:01.074
But you will never survive!

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:02.950
Hey, bud, not now, okay?

1:01:03.034 --> 1:01:03.993
Aw.

1:01:04.952 --> 1:01:06.663
And we still have this kill code thingy.

1:01:06.746 --> 1:01:07.830
Exactly.

1:01:07.914 --> 1:01:10.875
Katie, it was your weird plan
that got us here.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:14.671
We're here because we don't think
like normal people.

1:01:14.754 --> 1:01:16.339

The Mitchells have always been weird,
and that's what makes us great.

1:01:28.559 --> 1:01:31.396
Back at that dinosaur place,
you said you believed in me.

1:01:32.313 --> 1:01:33.731
Yep. Uh-huh.

1:01:33.815 --> 1:01:38.236
Well, I believe this group of weirdos
is the best hope humanity's got.

1:01:43.408 --> 1:01:44.659
So, let's get weird.

1:01:49.789 --> 1:01:50.832
You need some help?

1:01:50.915 --> 1:01:52.417
[chuckles] Sure.

1:01:53.710 --> 1:01:55.545
Just close the jack up, and that's that.

1:01:57.839 --> 1:01:59.882
Oh, they're nice.

1:01:59.966 --> 1:02:02.218
So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said that out loud.

1:02:05.304 --> 1:02:07.390
Oh, come on. You boys are family now.

1:02:08.474 --> 1:02:09.475
I feel

1:02:12.603 --> 1:02:14.856
I made eye water just like you.

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:16.858
We might actually do this.

1:02:16.941 --> 1:02:21.112
I wish there was, like, footage of us
walking out of the mall in slow motion,

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:26.743

and absolutely unnecessary.

[mocking] "Yes, my queen."

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:56.916
"Whatever you want."

1:03:56.999 --> 1:03:59.293
[mock babbling]

1:04:02.213 --> 1:04:06.759
It's time to tear
the Mitchell family apart.

1:04:09.095 --> 1:04:11.305
[Rick] All right.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1:04:15.476 --> 1:04:17.311
Highway 85 is heavily patrolled.

1:04:17.395 --> 1:04:19.188
-Take the back roads.
-Got it.

1:04:21.107 --> 1:04:24.026
[Katie grunts, shudders]

1:04:40.459 --> 1:04:41.836
[engine starts]

1:04:48.759 --> 1:04:50.553
[snoring]

1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:53.639
[both snoring]

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:54.807
[Rick snorts]

1:04:55.933 --> 1:04:57.351
Is Dad dying?

1:04:57.435 --> 1:05:00.062
Katie, that's what I deal with
every night.

1:05:00.146 --> 1:05:02.273
-[whispers] Pray for me.
-[laughs]

1:05:02.356 --> 1:05:03.733
[snoring]

1:05:08.070 --> 1:05:09.739
You're a lot like him, you know.

1:05:09.822 --> 1:05:10.865
That's crazy.

1:05:10.948 --> 1:05:12.408
-[laughs, snorts]
-[Rick snorts]

1:05:16.162 --> 1:05:18.164
There's more to your dad than you think.

1:05:19.081 --> 1:05:21.709
Here, I was gonna give this to you
when you left, but--

1:05:21.792 --> 1:05:23.461
Check the first page there.

1:05:23.544 --> 1:05:26.422
[Katie] Whoa. Look at you two.
You look like hipsters.

1:05:26.505 --> 1:05:28.174
Were you in an indie folk band?

1:05:28.257 --> 1:05:31.844
[chuckles] Oh, your father used to be
kind of an artist himself.

1:05:31.928 --> 1:05:34.180
He built that whole cabin
with his own hands.

1:05:34.263 --> 1:05:37.433
Oh, this is, like, super beautiful.

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:40.311
Oh, it was his pride and joy.

1:05:41.729 --> 1:05:45.650
Since I met him, that was his dream,
to live in the woods.

1:05:45.733 --> 1:05:47.777
[sighs] He loved it up there.

1:05:48.444 --> 1:05:50.905
But, you know, it didn't work out.

1:05:51.906 --> 1:05:52.782
It just killed him.

1:05:54.367 --> 1:05:56.994
I think he's just afraid
that could happen to you.

1:05:58.704 --> 1:06:00.081
Why did he just give up?

1:06:00.164 --> 1:06:02.458
-[yawning] Mom, what is that?
-Huh? What the--

1:06:02.541 --> 1:06:03.876
[tires screech]

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.962
-[gasping]
-What?

1:06:06.629 --> 1:06:08.589
[ethereal music playing]

1:06:16.555 --> 1:06:17.556
Whoa.

1:06:19.058 --> 1:06:20.351
Oh my gosh.

1:06:20.434 --> 1:06:22.561
[epic music playing]

1:06:40.663 --> 1:06:42.164
[Linda] Is that the Poseys?

1:06:42.248 --> 1:06:44.917
They still look incredible.

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:47.586
I… is Abbey Posey okay?

1:06:50.297 --> 1:06:52.550
[gasps] You like that Posey girl?

1:06:52.633 --> 1:06:54.468
No. [laughs]

1:06:56.220 --> 1:06:59.056
Don't hide your feelings, man.
That's no way to live.

1:06:59.974 --> 1:07:01.726
[Deborahbot 5000] Pal is located there

1:07:01.809 --> 1:07:03.144
in the floating rhombus.

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:08.774
Yes, my queen.

1:07:09.275 --> 1:07:11.318
Ah, this is gonna be harder
than I thought.

1:07:11.402 --> 1:07:13.779
[Katie] Hold on.
Dad, that's… that's kind of weak.

1:07:13.863 --> 1:07:15.364
This is, like, a big moment.

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:17.658
Try this instead.

1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:19.493
Oh yeah. Okay. That's better.

1:07:19.577 --> 1:07:21.537
[dramatically] The endgame has begun.

1:07:22.288 --> 1:07:23.831
That? Is that what you're looking for?

1:07:23.914 --> 1:07:25.916
All right, Katie, what's the plan?

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.294
Okay. We dress as robots,

1:07:28.794 --> 1:07:30.880
we sneak in, hijack one of those trams,

1:07:30.963 --> 1:07:33.299
take it to the top of that
diamond thing where Pal is,

1:07:33.382 --> 1:07:37.178
destroy her with the kill code
and save the world.

1:07:37.762 --> 1:07:39.722
And then, to top it all off,

1:07:39.805 --> 1:07:43.934
celebrate our success with some burritos
from that taco place that's on the corner.

1:07:44.018 --> 1:07:47.313
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Burritos?
What about one of those fancy buffets?

1:07:47.396 --> 1:07:49.607
They have mini cheesecakes
sometimes, right?

1:07:49.690 --> 1:07:53.736
[Rick] Okay, fine. Once we save the world,
we'll celebrate at a fancy buffet.

1:07:53.819 --> 1:07:56.155
Question. Can Monchi be wearing
a little tuxedo at the end,

1:07:56.238 --> 1:07:57.448
like a little gentleman?

1:07:57.531 --> 1:08:00.367
[Rick] Okay, fine, and Monchi's wearing
a little tuxedo, but that is it.

1:08:00.451 --> 1:08:01.494
Like a little gentleman?

1:08:01.577 --> 1:08:03.996
-Yes, like a little gentleman.
-[laughs]

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:06.123
Mitchells, engage.

1:08:06.207 --> 1:08:07.208
[dramatic music playing]

1:08:07.291 --> 1:08:08.751
[vocalizing a melody]

1:08:08.834 --> 1:08:09.960
[robots yell]

1:08:13.380 --> 1:08:14.256
How do I look?

1:08:15.341 --> 1:08:16.342
Be honest. Stupid?

1:08:16.425 --> 1:08:18.427
-I look stupid, don't I?
-[chuckling] No.

1:08:21.305 --> 1:08:22.139
You look great.

1:08:26.102 --> 1:08:27.478
Come on. Let's go.

1:08:43.744 --> 1:08:46.330
Uh, guys, what about Monchi?

1:08:47.206 --> 1:08:48.249
[grunts softly]

1:08:51.252 --> 1:08:53.754
Aaron, I'm not so sure
this is a viable solution.

1:08:53.838 --> 1:08:54.839
[Aaron] Sure, it is.

1:08:54.922 --> 1:08:56.090
[panting]

1:08:56.173 --> 1:08:57.925
It's like a warm, wet hat.

1:08:58.008 --> 1:09:00.636
[Eric] Move your sweaty meat logs
in unison.

1:09:00.719 --> 1:09:02.805
-Left, right, left, right.
-Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp.

1:09:02.888 --> 1:09:04.181
What? What are you doing?

1:09:04.265 --> 1:09:07.768
[in robotic voice]
Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp. I am a robot.

1:09:07.852 --> 1:09:10.855
Just to educate you,
that's a hurtful stereotype.

1:09:12.857 --> 1:09:15.109
[ethereal music playing]

1:09:27.913 --> 1:09:29.623
[electrical humming]

1:09:30.833 --> 1:09:32.126
Oh my gosh.

1:09:36.505 --> 1:09:38.924
It's like a Journey album cover.

1:09:39.550 --> 1:09:40.676
[Aaron] What's an album?

1:09:44.138 --> 1:09:46.473
Attention, all robots.

1:09:46.557 --> 1:09:48.809
I'm on the lookout for these goobers.

1:09:49.351 --> 1:09:50.853
They're probably nearby.

1:09:50.936 --> 1:09:53.647
If I know humans,
they're disguised as one of you.

1:09:53.731 --> 1:09:56.692
Be on high alert
for any robots acting erratically.

1:09:59.653 --> 1:10:00.863
It won't be hard to find them.

1:10:00.946 --> 1:10:02.990
Just look for anyone
who can't keep it together.

1:10:03.073 --> 1:10:04.325
[Aaron] Oh boy.

1:10:04.408 --> 1:10:06.202
[in dark voice] Anomaly detected.

1:10:11.415 --> 1:10:12.833
-[panting]
-[whimpering]

1:10:12.917 --> 1:10:14.460
-[panting rapidly]
-Monchi, come on.

1:10:15.044 --> 1:10:17.254
[Pal] It only takes
one single imperfection,

1:10:17.338 --> 1:10:18.923
and they'll reveal themselves.

1:10:24.595 --> 1:10:27.139
-[Rick whispering] Up there! Shh! Quiet!
-[Katie whispering] I made up the plan!

1:10:27.223 --> 1:10:28.140
[Mitchells whispering]

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:30.893
[singsongy] Where are those Mitchells?

1:10:31.769 --> 1:10:34.188
-Where are they hiding?
-[indistinct whispering]

1:10:36.899 --> 1:10:38.734
[Pal] They think they can
pass as one of us…

1:10:38.817 --> 1:10:39.693
[all gasp]

1:10:39.777 --> 1:10:40.986
[panting]

1:10:41.070 --> 1:10:42.821
…with their lumpy, misshapen bodies.

1:10:42.905 --> 1:10:44.031
Well, go ahead.

1:10:45.658 --> 1:10:46.492
Oh.

1:10:47.159 --> 1:10:48.619
[strained grunting]

1:10:49.954 --> 1:10:51.247
But I'm onto them.

1:10:52.414 --> 1:10:54.250
[robotic voice] Magnetic link activated.

1:10:55.751 --> 1:10:58.545
[Pal] Because I've been
watching the Mitchells,

1:10:58.629 --> 1:11:01.215
and I've learned all about them.

1:11:01.298 --> 1:11:03.968
They're pretending to be capable.

1:11:04.051 --> 1:11:05.135
[screaming on video]

1:11:05.219 --> 1:11:07.596
They're pretending to be
a normal-looking family.

1:11:08.430 --> 1:11:11.225
[Pal] You think this is fooling anyone?

1:11:11.308 --> 1:11:13.894
Even when they're being nice
to each other…

1:11:13.978 --> 1:11:15.980
-The world needs you.
-…they're pretending.

1:11:16.063 --> 1:11:17.856
I need you.

1:11:20.150 --> 1:11:22.903
[Aaron] It's cool to see you
and Dad being friends again.

1:11:22.987 --> 1:11:25.656
[gasps] Please, no, no, no, no,
don't watch it.

1:11:26.282 --> 1:11:28.742
[Katie] Oh, I… I was just telling him
what he wants to hear.

1:11:28.826 --> 1:11:30.369
I didn't mean a word of that.

1:11:32.288 --> 1:11:36.333
I just wanna get my future back
and get away forever.

1:11:36.417 --> 1:11:38.460
[inhales sharply] Dad, let me explain.

1:11:38.544 --> 1:11:40.587
I just-- I-- Uh-- I--

1:11:40.671 --> 1:11:41.797
-[Pal] There they are.
-No!

1:11:45.050 --> 1:11:46.093
You're mine now.

1:12:05.404 --> 1:12:07.072
[alarm blaring]

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:18.459
[Katie panting]

1:12:19.043 --> 1:12:19.877
Dad?

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:21.962
I… I'm sorry. I don't mean that anymore.

1:12:22.046 --> 1:12:26.091
I mean, I… I did then, but I-- Uh…

1:12:27.426 --> 1:12:29.053
[grunting]

1:12:29.136 --> 1:12:30.596
Mitchells, we will help you.

1:12:30.679 --> 1:12:32.348
-No, no, you don't.
-[sharp electronic hum]

1:12:32.431 --> 1:12:33.474

1:12:33.557 --> 1:12:35.559
[electronic warbling]

1:12:35.642 --> 1:12:36.852
[Pal] Capture the Mitchells.

1:12:36.935 --> 1:12:39.355
No! You don't have to listen to her.

1:12:39.897 --> 1:12:41.273
[both] We're sorry, Mother.

1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:45.694
[tense music playing]

1:12:48.989 --> 1:12:49.990
[grunting]

1:12:50.074 --> 1:12:50.949
Run!

1:12:51.909 --> 1:12:53.494
[screams, grunts]

1:12:53.577 --> 1:12:54.578
[Pal] They got away.

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:57.081
Find them, and find them now!

1:13:04.755 --> 1:13:07.174
No! No, no!

1:13:08.300 --> 1:13:11.095
[ethereal music playing]

1:13:22.564 --> 1:13:24.274
[panting]

1:13:25.234 --> 1:13:26.318
[Katie] Hey, come on.

1:13:31.949 --> 1:13:35.994
[distorted robotic beeping]

1:13:38.872 --> 1:13:40.124
What are we gonna do?

1:13:40.707 --> 1:13:41.917
[Aaron sniffling]

1:13:42.501 --> 1:13:43.585
Aaron?

1:13:43.669 --> 1:13:44.962
Hey, hey.

1:13:45.462 --> 1:13:46.505
It's okay.

1:13:46.588 --> 1:13:47.840
-Uh…
-[Monchi panting]

1:13:48.507 --> 1:13:50.467
Uh-oh. Watch out.

1:13:50.551 --> 1:13:52.302
Monchi coming at ya.

1:13:53.220 --> 1:13:55.597
[sobbing]

1:13:55.681 --> 1:13:57.224
[sniffles] Katie, stop.

1:13:59.226 --> 1:14:01.103
Why'd you say all that stuff?

1:14:01.186 --> 1:14:03.230
I'm sorry. I… I just wanted to--

1:14:05.357 --> 1:14:06.442
[sighs] I don't know.

1:14:09.778 --> 1:14:11.196
[Aaron sniffling]

1:14:12.281 --> 1:14:14.491
Okay. Are you hungry?

1:14:15.117 --> 1:14:17.244
Do you want some fruit snacks
or something?

1:14:17.327 --> 1:14:19.455
-I don't know.
-Here, can you hold this?

1:14:21.748 --> 1:14:22.791
[electronic chiming]

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:25.002
That? Is that what you're looking for?

1:14:25.794 --> 1:14:26.795
[giggling]

1:14:26.879 --> 1:14:28.589

[Rick babbling on video]

1:14:31.258 --> 1:14:33.469
Oh man. Have I been recording over those?

1:14:34.011 --> 1:14:36.472
Mom dance. Mom dance. Mom dance.

1:14:36.555 --> 1:14:39.016
-You're loving it.
-How far back do these go?

1:14:39.099 --> 1:14:40.476
[cooing]

1:14:40.559 --> 1:14:41.518
[Linda] Hey, Katie.

1:14:41.602 --> 1:14:43.479
Can you say, "Bye-bye, house"?

1:14:43.562 --> 1:14:44.897
Bye-bye, house.

1:14:49.276 --> 1:14:50.611
[Linda] You ready, hon?

1:14:50.694 --> 1:14:52.029
[Rick sighs]

1:14:52.112 --> 1:14:53.197
[Rick] Almost.

1:14:55.449 --> 1:14:57.284
[Linda] I know this is hard for you.

1:14:59.536 --> 1:15:00.496
Nah.

1:15:02.372 --> 1:15:04.416
[chuckles] It's easy.

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:05.334
[babbling]

1:15:08.545 --> 1:15:10.088
One last-- [clears throat]

1:15:10.172 --> 1:15:11.924
Something to remember the place by.

1:15:13.175 --> 1:15:15.135
[laughing] Come on, Lin. Turn that off.

1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:22.935
Oh man.

1:15:25.437 --> 1:15:28.398
[Rick on video] Okay, you got this.
Just turn the wheel. There you go.

1:15:28.482 --> 1:15:30.275
-Like this? [laughs]
-Slow down there.

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:33.612
Across the stream and down the river.
