AND I'M TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW,

17:39.192 --> 17:41.325
NEVER TELL A WOMAN
IN LABOR

17:41.327 --> 17:43.694
THAT SHE LOOKS
LIKE BUDDY HACKETT.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.532
I DON'T KNOW. JUSTIN WAS
MY FIRST REAL BOYFRIEND.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.101
I THINK MAYBE
I SHOULD BE MORE UPSET.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.336
WHAT YOU<i> THINK</i>
DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.038
SEE, THIS IS
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.441
AND YOUR FEELINGS
ARE GONNA COME UP.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.676
EVEN IF
IT'S 50 YEARS LATER

17:58.678 --> 18:01.045
WHEN YOU'RE SHOWING OFF
YOUR MEDIA ROOM.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.947
SO, I'M NOT COLD?
YOU'RE NOT COLD AT ALL.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.248
YOU HAVE
GREAT FEELINGS.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.850
YOU -- YOU CARE
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY

18:05.852 --> 18:08.786
AND YOUR FRIENDS AND GOD
AND THE BRONCOS...

18:08.788 --> 18:10.955
I DO CRY WHEN THEY LOSE.
MM-HMM.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.391
AND I CRIED
AFTER THE 2012 ELECTION.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.860
I MEAN,
EVEN ROMNEY DIDN'T CRY.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.428
HE'S NOT
PROGRAMMED TO.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.931
ROMNEY IS,
IN FACT, A ROBOT.

18:22.968 --> 18:25.203
HEY.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.771
HEY, HOW WAS ED'S TV?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.439
HEAVY.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.641
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU OKAY?

18:30.643 --> 18:31.642
YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS
YOU WANT --

18:31.644 --> 18:34.712
I GOT TO GO.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.980
WELL, GOOD GOING.
YOU SPOOKED HER.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.883
LIKE THAT 10-POINT BUCK I TRIED
TO SHOOT ON OUR HONEYMOON.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.251
YEAH.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.286
YEAH, HONEY, YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOT AT A DEER

18:42.288 --> 18:44.155
FROM THE BALCONY
OF OUR BRIDAL SUITE.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.757
MM-HMM.
AND, UH -- AND I'M THE ONE
WHO'S OUT OF LINE?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.960
UNH-UNH.
[ CHUCKLES ]

18:48.962 --> 18:50.795
HEY, DID SHE SHOW ANY EMOTION?
SHE CRY? ANYTHING?
NO.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.396
IF SHE NEEDS LESSONS,

18:52.398 --> 18:55.633
SHE CAN TAKE THEM
FROM ED AND CHUCK.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.468
HEY, MOM, HAVE YOU SEEN
JUSTIN'S HEADPHONES?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.337
I WANT TO RETURN THEM
AND GET THIS OVER WITH.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.339
UH, YEAH, I DROPPED THEM OFF
WITH JUSTIN'S MOM.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.008
WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE IS SO SWEET.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.944
WOULD IT BE WEIRD FOR YOU
IF BETTY AND I STAYED FRIENDS?

19:06.946 --> 19:08.946
YOU DROPPED THEM OFF?

19:08.948 --> 19:10.581
WELL, Y-Y-YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO HAVE TO SEE HIM,

19:10.583 --> 19:11.782
SO I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD --
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT, MOM?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.484
I WAS GOING TO DO THAT!
YOU DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME FIRST!

19:13.486 --> 19:14.986
NO, NO, NO, BUT, BABE,
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
A CLEAN EXIT, RIGHT?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.921
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST DO ME
A FAVOR AND DON'T THINK, OKAY?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.856
JUST -- FROM NOW ON,
STAY OUT OF MY LIFE.

[ EVE CRYING ]

19:33.805 --> 19:35.640
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:35.642 --> 19:38.643
SHE'S IN THERE CRYING, MIKE.
IT'S TERRIBLE.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.111
ALL WEEK LONG,
YOU'VE WANTED HER TO CRY.

19:40.113 --> 19:41.712
YES, SHE'S MY BABY.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.215
WELL, NOW THAT SHE'S CRYING,
YOU WANT HER TO STOP?

19:44.217 --> 19:47.652
YES, SHE'S MY BABY.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.853
S-S-SHE JUST NEEDS SOME TIME
BY HERSELF.

19:48.855 --> 19:49.820
JUST GET AWAY FR--
W-W-WAIT, BUT IF --

19:49.822 --> 19:51.222
HAVE I MADE IT CLEAR

19:51.224 --> 19:53.791
THAT I'M AVAILABLE
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THIS?

19:53.793 --> 19:55.826
I THINK
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

19:55.828 --> 19:59.630
OH -- WELL, I-I'M GONNA WAIT
HERE JUST IN CASE SHE NEEDS ME.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.798
AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

Eve: MOM?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.901
OH, THANK GOD.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.744
HEY, MIKE BAXTER HERE
FOR OUTDOOR MAN

20:13.746 --> 20:16.180
WITH OUR VALENTINE'S DAY
GIFT COMBO --

20:16.182 --> 20:19.750
HIP WADERS AND A SLEEPING BAG.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.985
HMM?

20:20.987 --> 20:22.553
SEE, YOU'LL NEED
THE SLEEPING BAG

20:22.555 --> 20:23.988
WHEN YOUR WIFE KICKS YOU OUT

20:23.990 --> 20:26.190
BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT HER
HIP WADERS.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.159
VALENTINE'S DAY
IS A CELEBRATION OF LOVE.

20:28.161 --> 20:29.760
BUT FOR A LOT OF LONELY PEOPLE,

20:29.762 --> 20:31.362
IT'S A BIG HOLIDAY
FOR DEPRESSION,

20:31.364 --> 20:33.998
WHICH IS WHY WE'LL BE CLOSING
THE SHOOTING RANGE

20:34.000 --> 20:36.200
VERY EARLY THAT DAY.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.202
WITH SO MUCH HEARTBREAK,

20:38.204 --> 20:40.004
WHY DO WE PUT
OURSELVES THROUGH THIS?

20:40.006 --> 20:43.007
IS LOVE NECESSARY
FOR OUR SURVIVAL?

20:43.009 --> 20:45.176
ANIMALS DON'T LOVE,
AND THEY SURVIVE JUST FINE,

20:45.178 --> 20:48.212
PRESENT COMPANY EXCLUDED.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.581
WHEN YOU SEE A GIRAFFE RUNNING
ON THE SAVANNAH,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.383
IT'S NOT RUNNING
AFTER ANOTHER GIRAFFE

20:52.385 --> 20:54.218
SAYING,
"PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME."

20:54.220 --> 20:58.623
IT'S RUNNING FROM A LION SAYING,
"PLEASE DON'T EAT ME."

20:58.625 --> 21:00.224
ONLY HUMANS ARE CAPABLE OF LOVE,

21:00.226 --> 21:02.226
AND THE BEST KIND OF LOVE
IS UNCONDITIONAL --

21:02.228 --> 21:05.062
LOVE OF FAMILY, LOVE OF FRIENDS,
LOVE OF GOD...

21:05.064 --> 21:08.366
AND LOVE OF YOUR NEW 4x4.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.534
LOVE IS ABOUT
THE BEST THING HUMANS HAVE.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.136
AS THE AUTHOR
ROBERT BRAULT SAID,

21:12.138 --> 21:14.138
"FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL LOVE YOU
FOR NO REASON,

21:14.140 --> 21:16.274
AND SHOWER THAT PERSON
WITH REASONS."

21:16.276 --> 21:18.909
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE HAPPINESS.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.879
SO, MAYBE FOLLOW UP THOSE
HIP WADERS WITH SOME FLOWERS.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.147
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,

21:23.149 --> 21:26.150
DON'T SHOW HER THE PRESENT
YOU GOT YOUR TRUCK.

21:26.152 --> 21:29.053
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY
FROM ALL OF US AT OUTDOOR MAN.
