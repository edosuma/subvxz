00:34.917 --> 00:37.402
DOUG, YOU'RE NOT
EVEN DRESSED YET?

00:37.470 --> 00:41.339
WE'RE NOT REALLY
GOING TO KARAOKE, ARE WE?

00:41.407 --> 00:43.224
I WENT TO SEE
JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME

00:43.292 --> 00:45.860
AT THE LEARNING ANNEX.

00:45.928 --> 00:48.563
YOU KNEW THAT BILL
WAS COMING DUE.

00:48.631 --> 00:52.417
DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS. I DON'T
PERFORM WELL UNDER PRESSURE.

00:52.485 --> 00:55.202
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

00:55.270 --> 00:59.757
BUT MAYBE KARAOKE
WILL BE DIFFERENT.

00:59.825 --> 01:03.044
RELAX, MAN. WE'LL ALL BE
THERE. IT'S GONNA BE A HOOT.

01:03.112 --> 01:05.029
A HOOT?

01:05.098 --> 01:07.832
YOU GOT TO STOP HANGING
AROUND WHITE PEOPLE.

01:09.685 --> 01:11.503
HEY, HEY. DANNY
ISN'T HERE YET, IS HE?

01:11.571 --> 01:12.737
MM-MMM.

01:12.805 --> 01:15.873
WHEN HE COMES HERE,
EXCUSE YOURSELF AND GO UPSTAIRS.

01:15.892 --> 01:17.058
WHAT FOR?

01:17.059 --> 01:18.944
I WANT YOU TO CALL HIM
ON HIS CELL PHONE, OK?

01:19.011 --> 01:23.230
SAY YOU'RE FROM THE LAB AND
YOU HAVE HIS TEST RESULTS, OK?

01:23.298 --> 01:26.500
AND THEN... YOU KNOW WHAT? I
HAVE IT ALL HERE IN THIS SCRIPT.

01:28.170 --> 01:31.873
THIS IS FUNNY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULD DO IT IN AN ACCENT.

01:31.941 --> 01:34.742
LIKE...
"I'M FROM THE INSTITUTE."

01:34.810 --> 01:37.095
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THAT
WOULD BE GREAT. HERE HE COMES.

01:37.163 --> 01:38.729
I GOT TO TRY
NOT TO LAUGH.

01:38.798 --> 01:41.032
WHAT'S UP, MAN?
HI, GUYS.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.233
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:42.301 --> 01:45.153
SPENCE WANTED ME
TO SCREW WITH YOU.

01:45.221 --> 01:46.838
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:46.922 --> 01:49.224
WOW. YOU REALLY DID
YOUR HOMEWORK.

01:49.291 --> 01:51.659
I WOULD'VE BEEN
DEVASTATED.

01:51.727 --> 01:54.596
I'M GONNA GRAB A BEER.

01:54.663 --> 01:56.965
DANNY PULLS PRANKS
ON ME ALL THE TIME.

01:57.032 --> 01:58.817
I JUST WANTED
TO GET HIM BACK ONCE.

01:58.851 --> 02:02.002
SPENCE, LET ME BREAK IT DOWN
FOR YOU. YOU'RE NOT A PRANKSTER.

02:02.070 --> 02:04.004
YOU'RE A VICTIM.

02:04.106 --> 02:08.092
ACCEPT IT, AND YOU'RE GONNA
SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF HEARTACHE.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.610
OH, BY THE WAY, WHEN WE
GET TO KARAOKE TONIGHT,

02:10.679 --> 02:12.480
I'M STAYING IN CHARACTER,

02:12.548 --> 02:17.152
SO I'LL ONLY ANSWER
TO "NEIL" OR "MR. DIAMOND."

02:17.219 --> 02:20.372
SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS GONNA SING?

02:20.506 --> 02:22.223
I WAS GONNA DO
THE CARPENTERS,

02:22.291 --> 02:24.659
BUT AFTER THAT
"WHITE PEOPLE" COMMENT,

02:24.726 --> 02:27.628
THINKING I MIGHT GO TUPAC.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.552
I DON'T GET
THIS SONG.

02:51.621 --> 02:54.172
DID SHE HEAR ABOUT THE
LETTER LISTENING TO THE RADIO,

02:54.240 --> 02:57.808
OR WAS IT PHYSICALLY
ON TOP OF THE RADIO?

02:57.877 --> 02:59.177
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M BLACK AND I'M PROUD,

02:59.245 --> 03:01.580
AND I'M SINGING
"LAUGHTER IN THE RAIN."

03:05.801 --> 03:08.052
WHOO!
GOOD, CARRIE!

03:09.655 --> 03:12.757
GIVE IT UP. YEAH!

03:12.824 --> 03:15.126
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.
YOUR TURN. HAVE FUN.

03:15.193 --> 03:16.761
YEAH, I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

03:16.828 --> 03:19.831
LET'S HAVE A BIG SCOOTER McGEE'S
WELCOME FOR DOUG HEFFERNAN!

03:19.898 --> 03:21.132
WHOO!

03:21.200 --> 03:24.068
YEAH!
COME ON, BABY!

04:17.773 --> 04:18.973
WHOO!

04:19.041 --> 04:21.509
WHOO! OOH!

04:24.830 --> 04:26.564
LET'S GIVE IT UP
FOR DOUG HEFFERNAN.

04:26.632 --> 04:27.865
YEAH!

04:27.883 --> 04:28.733
HONEY,

04:28.801 --> 04:31.536
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THAT DID NOT SUCK.

04:31.603 --> 04:33.488
YEAH, THAT WAS GREAT.

04:33.556 --> 04:35.340
I FELT LIKE
I WAS OFF-REALLY?

04:35.424 --> 04:36.424
YEAH.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.147
DID YOU FIND
A MOVIE YET?

04:42.214 --> 04:45.449
AT THE MIDWAY WE CAN
STILL MAKE THE 7:15 SHOWING

04:45.517 --> 04:46.851
<i>OF HABEAS CORPUS.</i>

04:46.919 --> 04:49.988
I HEAR THAT'S GREAT.
IT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY.

04:50.105 --> 04:52.039
MM-MMM. YOU KNOW MY RULE.

04:52.107 --> 04:55.743
IF IT'S TRUE,
IT'S CRAPAROO.

04:56.962 --> 04:58.396
I'LL KEEP LOOKING.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.633
DOUG, YOU GOT AN E-MAIL.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.818
HMM. WHO IS IT FROM?

05:03.869 --> 05:07.605
UH, IT SAYS,
"CUTIEPIE32."

05:07.656 --> 05:09.791
OH. OPEN IT UP.

05:09.858 --> 05:11.025
OK.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.461
"I HOPE THIS IS
THE RIGHT DOUG HEFFERNAN.

05:13.528 --> 05:16.197
"DID YOU SING AT THE
KARAOKE BAR LAST NIGHT?

05:16.264 --> 05:18.600
"I'M THERE ALMOST EVERY
NIGHT, AND YOU WERE AWESOME.

05:18.667 --> 05:20.602
ANYWAY, JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW."

05:20.669 --> 05:21.836
HMM.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.072
FAN MAIL.

05:24.139 --> 05:27.541
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET THAT WHEN
YOU WON THE WING-EATING CONTEST.

05:27.610 --> 05:29.777
THAT TIME YOU PUT
YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE.

05:29.845 --> 05:31.779
YEAH, RELAX, EVERYBODY, ALL RIGHT?

05:31.847 --> 05:34.148
YOU SANG "BRANDY."
IT'S LIKE ONE OCTAVE.

05:35.901 --> 05:38.869
OK, GUYS, LET'S HIT THIS
PIZZA HARD AND GET OUT OF HERE.

05:38.937 --> 05:41.573
<i>I'M NOT MISSING THE HARRY
POTTER PREVIEW AGAIN.</i>

05:43.809 --> 05:45.243
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:45.311 --> 05:47.278
DOUG'S GOT A LITTLE
KARAOKE FAN.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.113
REALLY?
YEAH.

05:49.181 --> 05:52.584
APPARENTLY, I DON'T JUST SING
A SONG. I MAKE LOVE TO IT.

05:52.635 --> 05:55.853
MAN. DO YOU THINK IT WAS
THOSE AER LINGUS STEWARDESSES

05:55.921 --> 05:57.888
THAT SANG
"DANCING QUEEN"?

05:57.956 --> 06:00.425
WHOA. LET'S NOT
GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES HERE.

06:00.476 --> 06:04.829
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
"CUTIEPIE" ISN'T "CUTIEGUY"?

06:04.897 --> 06:07.599
YOU KNOW WHO IT IS?
I BET YOU IT'S THE HOT WAITRESS.

06:07.666 --> 06:09.267
YOU REMEMBER SHE SAID
I DID A GOOD JOB.

06:09.301 --> 06:11.952
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S NOT LIKE SHE
WAS ANGLING FOR A TIP OR ANYTHING.

06:15.657 --> 06:19.227
OOH, LOOK AT THIS. I GOT
ANOTHER E-MAIL FROM CUTIEPIE32.

06:19.294 --> 06:21.095
UNBELIEVABLE.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.580
"OK, TRUTH TIME.

06:22.648 --> 06:25.182
"IT'S NOT JUST THAT
I'M A FAN OF YOUR SINGING.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.184
"I THINK YOU'RE REALLY SEXY.

06:27.252 --> 06:29.186
"OH, AND THANKS FOR OPENING
YOUR SHIRT A LITTLE.

06:29.254 --> 06:31.221
THAT WAS THE ICING
ON THE CAKE."

06:31.240 --> 06:33.975
SHE'S USING A SEMI-COLON
AND CLOSED PARENTHESES.

06:34.042 --> 06:37.378
SHE'S WINKING AT YOU.

06:37.496 --> 06:39.813
HEY. I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE GOING TO THE MOVIES.

06:39.849 --> 06:41.850
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
LET'S GET GOING.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.151
TAKE CARE, CARRIE.

06:43.219 --> 06:46.221
<i>DON'T WANNA BE LATE
FOR HABEAS CORPUS.</i>

06:46.305 --> 06:49.006
HAVE FUN. DOUG.
YEAH?

06:49.024 --> 06:51.492
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
YOUR LAPTOP TO THE MOVIES?

06:51.644 --> 06:54.846
UH, SO I CAN WRITE
ABOUT IT IN MY BLOG.

07:03.972 --> 07:05.322
COME ON, MAN.

07:05.390 --> 07:07.458
ARE WE GONNA PLAY
BASKETBALL OR WHAT?

07:07.543 --> 07:11.178
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES. SHE'S
GONNA E-MAIL ME. I CAN FEEL IT.

07:11.246 --> 07:13.364
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HER IN 3 DAYS.

07:13.431 --> 07:17.568
I KNOW. ONE MINUTE SHE'S SENDING
ME A LIST OF OUR CHILDREN'S NAMES-

07:17.636 --> 07:19.353
I LIKE CALEB.

07:19.421 --> 07:22.423
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, NOTHING.
I DON'T GET IT.

07:22.490 --> 07:24.609
MAYBE SHE'S JUST BEEN BUSY
AND DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME.

07:24.626 --> 07:25.893
HEY, YOU'RE A STALKER.

07:25.961 --> 07:28.029
YOU MAKE THE TIME.

07:30.299 --> 07:32.300
UH-HUH. BACK IN BUSINESS.

07:32.367 --> 07:34.102
LET ME SEE HERE.

07:34.169 --> 07:36.737
UHH! IT'S FROM MY MOM.

07:36.805 --> 07:39.807
"10 REASONS WHY MEN
LEAVE THE SEAT UP."

07:39.875 --> 07:42.610
DELETE! DELETE!

07:42.661 --> 07:45.746
TAKE IT EASY, MAN. WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING ALL WORKED UP ABOUT THIS FOR?

07:45.814 --> 07:48.166
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST MADE ME FEEL GOOD.

07:48.233 --> 07:52.870
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THAT A WOMAN
ASKS TO SEE ME IN TIGHTER CLOTHES.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.356
YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE
PROBABLY JUST LOST INTEREST.

07:55.424 --> 07:58.125
MEMORIES FADE, MAN.
THINK ABOUT IT.

07:58.193 --> 08:01.028
YOU SANG ONE SONG
TO HER A WEEK AGO.

08:30.709 --> 08:33.577
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE NEXT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SING?

08:33.645 --> 08:37.347
NEIL DIAMOND.

08:37.414 --> 08:39.933
OH, SORRY. YOU, UH
- YOU GOT TO PICK SOMETHING ELSE.

08:40.001 --> 08:43.037
SOMEBODY SANG HIM
AT HAPPY HOUR.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.257
SO WHAT?

08:46.325 --> 08:48.759
WE DON'T
DOUBLE DIAMOND HERE.

08:50.128 --> 08:52.062
IT SAYS SO
ON THE SIGN-UP SHEET.

08:52.130 --> 08:54.799
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'LL DO IT NEXT WEEK.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.069
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT PUNISHING ME.

08:58.136 --> 09:00.304
YOU'RE PUNISHING THEM.

09:32.287 --> 09:34.739
HOW MUCH FUN WAS THAT?
I KNOW.

09:34.806 --> 09:37.091
I HAD TO DRAG YOU THERE
THE FIRST TIME,

09:37.159 --> 09:39.160
AND NOW YOU'RE
DRAGGING ME THERE.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.979
I GOT THE FEVER!
I KNOW.

09:42.064 --> 09:44.298
HEY, HONEY, WHAT DO
YOU SAY WE GO UPSTAIRS

09:44.366 --> 09:47.668
AND, UH, MAKE
SOME MORE ENDLESS LOVE?

09:47.736 --> 09:50.571
OH. WELL, I WOULDN'T COUNT
ON THE "ENDLESS" PART,

09:50.638 --> 09:52.339
BUT YEAH.

09:52.407 --> 09:54.242
OK. I'M GONNA
GO TAKE A SHOWER.

09:54.359 --> 09:58.178
ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE UP THERE
IN A MINUTE.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.236
S- S-STILL NOTHING.

10:06.304 --> 10:07.638
HONEY?

10:07.706 --> 10:09.407
UH... WHAT?

10:09.475 --> 10:12.576
UH, I WAS THINKING...
WANNA TAKE A SHOWER WITH ME?

10:12.644 --> 10:14.312
CONSERVE WATER?

10:14.396 --> 10:16.597
OH. SEE, NOW, I LIKE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING THERE

10:16.665 --> 10:19.667
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE
WE CAN GET UP THERE

10:19.735 --> 10:22.035
AND HAVE A LITTLE-

10:24.473 --> 10:26.740
FUN. LET'S LATHER UP.

10:26.808 --> 10:30.278
WHO'S "CUTIEPIE32"?

10:30.345 --> 10:32.613
YEAH, I THINK IT'S DEA-
IT'S DEACON.

10:35.617 --> 10:39.353
"THE SUBJECT IS 'YOUR ARMS
LOOKED SEXY TONIGHT.'"

10:40.722 --> 10:43.824
YEAH, IT'S
DEFINITELY DEACON.

10:43.892 --> 10:45.059
OPEN IT UP.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.360
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TALK TO HIM TOMORROW.

10:46.378 --> 10:48.145
YOU SHOULD OPEN IT UP.
OK.

10:48.163 --> 10:49.664
OK.

10:52.801 --> 10:54.836
THERE YOU GO.
OH!

10:54.903 --> 10:59.239
DID DEACON SCAN HIS PANTIES
AND SEND THEM TO YOU?

10:59.307 --> 11:02.126
THAT, MY FRIEND,
IS A CRY FOR HELP.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.379
ALL RIGHT, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

11:05.447 --> 11:07.715
NOTHING. JU-
WHO IS THAT?

11:07.783 --> 11:09.800
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW?

11:09.868 --> 11:11.436
I DON'T KNOW.
I NEVER MET HER.

11:11.503 --> 11:13.204
SHE SAW ME SING KARAOKE,

11:13.272 --> 11:16.407
AND, UH, SHE'S BEEN E
- MAILING ME EVER SINCE. I DON'T WRITE HER BACK.

11:16.492 --> 11:19.744
SO THAT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT ME THERE
TONIGHT? SO YOU COULD SING TO HER?

11:19.795 --> 11:21.312
AND YOU.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.949
COME ON.
HOW ABOUT THAT SHOWER?

11:25.017 --> 11:26.750
OH, MY-
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.552
I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING WRONG HERE.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.654
YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING WRONG?

11:29.721 --> 11:31.956
YOU'RE HAVING SOME THING
WITH SOME CYBER-SKANK.

11:32.023 --> 11:35.292
IT'S NOT A THING. SHE'S
STALKING ME. I'M THE VICTIM HERE.

11:35.344 --> 11:38.078
OH, YOU'RE THE VICTIM.
OK. YOU'RE LOVING THIS.

11:38.147 --> 11:39.847
OH, COM-

11:39.914 --> 11:41.715
OH, I GET IT.

11:41.783 --> 11:43.917
OH, MY... YOU'RE JEALOUS.

11:43.936 --> 11:46.070
I'M JEALOUS.
I'M JEALOUS OF WHAT?

11:46.105 --> 11:49.223
YOU'RE JEALOUS I HAVE
A STALKER AND YOU DON'T.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.292
EXCUSE ME, DOUG.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.194
I HAVE HAD
PLENTY OF STALKERS, OK?

11:53.262 --> 11:55.429
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAD
TO MOVE OR CHANGE MY PHONE NUMBER

11:55.497 --> 11:57.831
'CAUSE I WAS BEING
HOUNDED BY SOME WEIRDO?

11:57.950 --> 12:01.602
HMM. NOT RINGING A BELL
SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU.

12:01.670 --> 12:06.173
ANYONE STALK YOU, SAY,
IN THE 21ST CENTURY?

12:06.241 --> 12:09.109
YES. AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M BEING STALKED RIGHT NOW.

12:09.178 --> 12:10.861
REALLY?
YEAH.

12:10.962 --> 12:13.647
BY WHO?
BY TOMMY LEONARDI, OK?

12:13.715 --> 12:16.383
I KNEW HIM FROM HIGH SCHOOL. HE GOOGLED
ME, AND HE E-MAILED ME JUST TODAY.

12:16.451 --> 12:17.918
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

12:17.985 --> 12:20.737
WOW. WHY DON'T
YOU SHOW ME?

12:25.310 --> 12:26.743
FINE. THAT'S FINE.

12:26.812 --> 12:29.446
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
IT AIN'T PRETTY.

12:31.616 --> 12:35.019
"THEN IN APRIL,
I WAS TRANSFERRED TO TUCSON.

12:35.086 --> 12:38.055
SO ME, ALICE, DYLAN, AND
THE TWINS PACKED UP THE CAR... "

12:38.156 --> 12:40.140
THAT'S YOUR STALKER?

12:40.208 --> 12:42.676
THAT'S A CHRISTMAS LETTER.

12:42.744 --> 12:44.562
DOUG, THAT'S
THE WAY IT STARTS.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.797
THEN THE PHONE CALLS.
THEN THE HANG-UPS.

12:46.865 --> 12:49.267
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE'S
GONNA BE WEARING MY SKIN AS A SUIT.

12:49.334 --> 12:51.068
NOW YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

12:51.136 --> 12:53.471
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

12:53.539 --> 12:57.608
ALL RIGHT. YOU AND YOUR LITTLE KARAOKE SLUT
- YOU'RE THROUGH. OK?

12:57.676 --> 12:59.143
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

12:59.177 --> 13:01.945
BELIEVE ME, IF THERE
WAS SOME MAGICAL WAY

13:02.013 --> 13:05.349
TO BLOCK HER
FROM E-MAILING ME, I WOULD.

13:09.271 --> 13:10.938
THERE.

13:11.005 --> 13:12.607
SHE'S BLOCKED.

13:14.042 --> 13:15.576
THANK YOU.

13:21.366 --> 13:23.334
DOUG, STOP
CHECKING YOUR INBOX.

13:23.401 --> 13:25.336
CARRIE BLOCKED HER.
IT'S OVER.

13:25.403 --> 13:27.171
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.689
I CAN'T HAVE
ANYTHING ANYMORE.

13:28.756 --> 13:31.125
NO MORE RING-DINGS.
NO STALKER.

13:31.193 --> 13:34.395
WHY DO I EVEN
GET OUT OF BED?

13:34.463 --> 13:36.247
<i>JUST COME WATCH
CELEBRITY POKER.</i>

13:36.315 --> 13:40.117
MARG HELGENBERGER
HAS POCKET ACES.

13:40.135 --> 13:41.902
I'M NOT
TAKING THIS ANYMORE.

13:41.970 --> 13:44.839
SPENCE, YOU KNOW ABOUT COMPUTER CRAP.
IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN UNDO THIS BLOCK?

13:44.906 --> 13:46.690
WELL, YEAH, BUT...

13:46.758 --> 13:47.958
THEN COME OVER HERE
AND HELP ME.

13:48.026 --> 13:49.776
I DON'T WANNA
GET CARRIE MAD AT ME.

13:49.844 --> 13:52.446
SHE DOESN'T
LIKE YOU ANYWAY, OK?

13:52.513 --> 13:54.748
NOW, DO ME A FAVOR AND
JUST UN-CRACK THE CODE.

13:54.816 --> 13:57.884
THERE'S NO CODE.
YOU JUST HIT "UNBLOCK."

13:57.953 --> 14:01.288
OK, I DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW
THE SAUSAGE IS MADE. JUST DO IT.

14:01.356 --> 14:04.724
I DID IT, OK?
AND I WAS NEVER HERE.

14:04.792 --> 14:07.127
OK. COME ON, CUTIEPIE32.

14:07.195 --> 14:09.129
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

14:09.197 --> 14:12.132
I'M SEEING YOUR CLOTHES
ALL OVER THE LAWN.

14:13.368 --> 14:14.435
AH.

14:14.503 --> 14:16.437
AND WELCOME BACK,
CUTIEPIE.

14:17.972 --> 14:21.758
"DEAR DOUG. FIRST YOU BLOCK
ME, THEN YOU UNBLOCK ME.

14:21.826 --> 14:25.396
NOBODY TREATS ME
LIKE THAT. NOBODY."

14:26.731 --> 14:27.965
DA-

14:28.033 --> 14:30.968
SHE'S A LITTLE...
SHE'S A LITTLE MIFFED.

14:34.172 --> 14:36.173
"DON'T THINK YOU CAN
GET AWAY FROM ME,

14:36.241 --> 14:38.175
BECAUSE I'M WATCHING YOU."

14:39.544 --> 14:40.945
WATCHING ME.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.915
THAT'S RIGHT OUT OF THE
"CRAZY" HANDBOOK, AM I RIGHT?

14:43.982 --> 14:45.950
YEAH. RIGHT.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.824
"I LIKE YOUR SHIRT.
I'M A METS FAN, TOO."

14:56.761 --> 14:58.695
UH... I-I-I'M
GONNA HEAD OUT.

14:58.763 --> 15:00.965
YEAH, YEAH. MY, UH, DOG'S
BEEN COOPED UP ALL DAY.

15:01.033 --> 15:02.633
I'M GONNA HEAD OUT, TOO.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.484
GUYS, IT'S
A LUCKY GUESS.

15:04.553 --> 15:08.072
HALF THE FAT GUYS
IN QUEENS WEAR METS SHIRTS.

15:45.293 --> 15:48.512
OH, GOD!

15:50.748 --> 15:53.817
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN WARN A PERSON
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA MAKE TEA, OK?

15:53.885 --> 15:56.286
COMMON COURTESY!

15:56.354 --> 15:58.172
YOU EVER HEAR OF KNOCKING?

15:58.240 --> 16:00.141
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:00.208 --> 16:02.126
THIS CAME IN.

16:04.128 --> 16:06.731
"HEY, DOUG, SORRY I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE HARD ON YOU.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.098
"YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
REALLY CHEER ME UP?

16:08.166 --> 16:10.601
"IF YOU WOULD SING ME A SONG
TONIGHT AT THE KARAOKE BAR.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.603
"HOW ABOUT
'I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU'?

16:12.671 --> 16:16.039
I REALLY HOPE
YOU DON'T LET ME DOWN."

16:17.742 --> 16:19.743
DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.279
YEAH? THIS CAME WITH IT.

16:27.219 --> 16:30.487
I GUESS YOU PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T LET HER DOWN.

16:31.873 --> 16:35.292
HEY, HOW MANY OF YOU
OUT THERE LIKE CHRISTMAS?

16:35.360 --> 16:38.562
WELL, I DO, TOO.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.465
WHY DON'T WE CELEBRATE A LITTLE
EARLY WITH ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

16:41.533 --> 16:44.268
AND IF ANYBODY LIKES
WHAT THEY HEAR OR SEE,

16:47.406 --> 16:49.907
THAT'S WITH TWO F's,
BY THE WAY. HERE WE GO.

17:05.390 --> 17:07.574
HELLO. ARE YOU
FROM OUT OF TOWN?

17:07.642 --> 17:09.476
YEAH, I COULD TELL.

17:09.544 --> 17:11.478
DID YOU GUYS
COME TOGETHER?

17:11.546 --> 17:14.114
OH, THAT'S
SO UNFORTUNATE.

17:14.182 --> 17:16.550
HEY, I NEED YOUR SPOT.
WHAT?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.801
NO WAY. I'VE BEEN
WAITING 2 WEEKS TO DO THIS.

17:18.869 --> 17:21.070
DANNY, IF MY STALKER DOESN'T HEAR
ME SING TONIGHT, I'M GONNA DIE.

17:21.156 --> 17:23.390
OH. I SEE. NOW I HAVE
TO GO ON HER SCHEDULE.

17:23.457 --> 17:26.242
YES. AND TELL THEM I'M GONNA
SING "I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU."

17:26.310 --> 17:28.595
FINE. I'LL TELL DJ RON.

17:28.663 --> 17:31.464
WHEN IS YOUR SPOT?
RIGHT AFTER CARRIE.

17:52.187 --> 17:53.720
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:55.924 --> 17:57.490
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:57.558 --> 18:00.244
CARRIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:00.312 --> 18:02.078
SINGING.

18:02.146 --> 18:04.330
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET STALKED.

18:04.398 --> 18:06.549
OK, LET'S MAKE
A LITTLE NOISE

18:06.617 --> 18:08.535
FOR DOUG HEFFERNAN!

18:08.603 --> 18:11.271
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,
IMPRESS YOUR LITTLE STALKER?

18:11.339 --> 18:13.741
NO. MY STALKER WENT ALL FATAL ATTRACTION
ON ME SINCE YOU BLOCKED HER E-MAILS.

18:13.808 --> 18:15.175
NOW SHE WANTS ME TO SING.

18:15.243 --> 18:17.361
WELL, SHOW HER TO ME.
I'LL KICK HER ASS.

18:17.428 --> 18:19.413
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING. NO! LET'S GO.

18:38.983 --> 18:40.517
I WILL ALWAYS...

18:40.585 --> 18:42.118
LOVE YOU.

19:10.165 --> 19:11.832
DOUG?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.400
WAIT.

19:20.624 --> 19:23.143
WHAT ARE YOU IN SUCH
A HURRY FOR, SWEETIE?

19:23.210 --> 19:26.630
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I SANG
YOUR SONG. NOW, LEAVE ME ALONE.

19:26.648 --> 19:29.482
SOMEBODY JUST WANTED ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS MESSAGE.

19:29.550 --> 19:31.118
HERE.

19:37.441 --> 19:39.009
"LOOK BEHIND YOU"?

19:40.712 --> 19:42.613
HELLO, DOUG.

19:42.680 --> 19:43.914
SPENCE?

19:43.981 --> 19:45.916
YOU'RE CUTIEPIE32?

19:45.983 --> 19:47.951
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:48.019 --> 19:50.086
WELL...

19:50.154 --> 19:52.823
SO... YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH ME?

19:52.891 --> 19:54.425
WHAT? NO!

19:54.492 --> 19:58.194
NO. LISTEN. IT ALL STARTED THAT
FIRST NIGHT WE WENT TO KARAOKE.

19:58.262 --> 20:00.613
YOU'RE NOT A PRANKSTER.
YOU'RE A VICTIM.

20:00.682 --> 20:03.750
ACCEPT IT, AND YOU'RE GONNA
SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF HEARTACHE.

20:36.968 --> 20:39.470
WHO'S THE VICTIM NOW?

20:39.537 --> 20:40.904
ME.

20:42.039 --> 20:45.576
AND IN ABOUT
ONE MINUTE, YOU.

20:45.643 --> 20:48.111
I'M-I'M GONNA GET GOING.
