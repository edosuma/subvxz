WEBVTT

00:06.277 --> 00:08.479
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I WAS INVESTIGATING

00:08.479 --> 00:11.182
WHAT CAUSED ALL THIS.

00:11.182 --> 00:14.285
I SEEMED TO HAVE AN IDEA WHY
ALL OF THIS WAS HAPPENING.
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE--
FINDING OUT WHAT CAUSED THIS.

00:14.285 --> 00:17.118
PRIORITY NUMBER TWO
IS FIGURING OUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:17.118 --> 00:21.152
IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN.
WHAT IF I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
BECAUSE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,

00:21.152 --> 00:25.126
I'M GONNA BE DEAD?
D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.758
TRACY WAS KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN,
BUT IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

00:27.758 --> 00:30.661
SHE'S ALIVE. YOU'RE WORRIED
YOUR FUTURE'S GONNA COME TRUE.

00:30.661 --> 00:34.065
I'M WORRIED MINE WON'T.

00:34.065 --> 00:36.507
(cell phone rings)

00:36.507 --> 00:38.369
THIS IS DEMETRI.

00:38.369 --> 00:40.541
(woman) Mr. Noh?
I'm sorry to disturb you,

00:40.541 --> 00:44.145
but I'm calling in response
to your Mosaic board posting.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.647
WHO IS THIS?
HOW DID YOU GET THIS NUMBER?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.219
I CAN'T DIVULGE THAT,

00:48.219 --> 00:51.152
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
MY VISION INVOLVED YOU.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.284
GO ON.
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

00:53.284 --> 00:56.387
I WAS READING
AN INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING,

00:56.387 --> 00:58.389
AND I AM SORRY.

00:58.389 --> 01:01.432
THERE IS NO DELICATE WAY
TO SAY THIS,

01:01.432 --> 01:05.396
BUT ON MARCH 15th, 2010,

01:05.396 --> 01:09.069
YOU ARE GOING
TO BE MURDERED.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.373
WHAT? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:12.373 --> 01:14.375
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE UPSET,

01:14.375 --> 01:17.548
BUT MY HOPE IS
BY TELLING YOU WHAT I KNOW,

01:17.548 --> 01:20.351
you will be able to prevent
your murder from happening.

01:20.351 --> 01:22.853
YOUR BRIEFING--
DID IT SAY WHO KILLED ME?
I'M AFRAID NOT.

01:22.853 --> 01:26.857
WELL, WHAT DID IT SAY THEN?
That you were an agent
from the American FBI,

01:26.857 --> 01:29.820
AND THAT YOU WERE SHOT
THREE TIMES IN THE CHEST.

01:29.820 --> 01:31.822
YOU GOTTA GIVE ME
MORE TO GO ON HERE.

01:31.822 --> 01:34.225
WHAT--WHAT KIND
OF BRIEFING WAS THIS?

01:34.225 --> 01:36.797
I'M SORRY, MR. NOH.
I HAVE TO END THIS CALL NOW.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.870
NO. WAIT, WAIT. HELLO? HELLO!
(dialing)

01:39.870 --> 01:41.632
HELLO? HELLO?
(error tone sounds)

01:41.632 --> 01:44.135
(automated female voice)
We're sorry. Your call

01:44.135 --> 01:50.811
cannot be completed as dialed.
(grunts) COME ON!

01:50.811 --> 01:53.244
(birds chirping)

01:53.244 --> 01:55.246
(speaking German)

01:59.290 --> 02:02.353
(speaking German)

02:20.311 --> 02:21.212
(chuckles)

02:53.844 --> 02:57.848
WE'RE TRAPPED IN HERE.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT.
I'M F-FREEZING!

02:57.848 --> 02:59.850
AT LEAST YOU HAVE FUR.

02:59.850 --> 03:01.882
OH! OH!

03:01.882 --> 03:04.455
HEY, NICOLE,
IT'S OLIVIA AGAIN.

03:04.455 --> 03:06.717
LOOK, BABE,
WE'RE NOT MAD, OKAY?

03:06.717 --> 03:09.360
WE'RE JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
SO CAN YOU PLEASE CALL

03:09.360 --> 03:11.722
AND LET US KNOW
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

03:11.722 --> 03:13.864
OKAY, WE'LL SPEAK
TO YOU SOON. BYE.

03:13.864 --> 03:16.897
(beep)
MAN. WE GOTTA COVER
FOR NICOLE AGAIN.

03:16.897 --> 03:20.771
I CAN PICK HER UP AFTER SCHOOL,
TAKE HER BACK TO WORK WITH ME.
ARE YOU SURE?

03:20.771 --> 03:23.574
YEAH. WE'RE SIFTING
THROUGH BLACKOUT INTEL

03:23.574 --> 03:26.737
FROM INTERPOL AND SUCH.
I'LL WELCOME THE DISTRACTION.

03:26.737 --> 03:28.439
(doorbell rings)
(Olivia) OKAY.

03:28.439 --> 03:31.542
THAT'S AARON.
AARON'S COMING HERE?

03:31.542 --> 03:34.915
PHONE'S BROKE.
SAID HE'D TAKE A LOOK.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.717
I JUST CALLED NICOLE.

03:36.717 --> 03:40.251
YEAH, THE PROBLEM'S
WITH MY WORK LINE.

03:40.251 --> 03:43.394
YOU CALLED ME FROM YOUR
WORK PHONE, SAID IT WAS URGENT.

03:43.394 --> 03:45.926
NOW YOU'RE LYING TO OLIVIA?
(scoffs)

03:45.926 --> 03:48.959
IF YOU WANT TO PREVENT
THE FUTURE AND SAVE

03:48.959 --> 03:51.862
YOUR MARRIAGE, FIRST STEP ISN'T
KEEPING SECRETS FROM YOUR WIFE.

03:51.862 --> 03:55.005
TAKE THAT FROM A GUY WHO'S
ALREADY BEEN DIVORCED, HUH?
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
IT'S ABOUT CHARLIE.

03:55.005 --> 03:58.769
WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU KNOW SHE'S BEEN FREAKING OUT
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW, RIGHT?

03:58.769 --> 04:00.671
THERE'S A GUY
WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING.

04:00.671 --> 04:02.613
WE'VE BEEN CALLING HIM
D. GIBBONS.

04:02.613 --> 04:04.915
CHARLIE'S VISION
HAD TO DO WITH HIM.

04:04.915 --> 04:07.478
SHE KNEW WHO HE WAS.

04:07.478 --> 04:10.981
SHE SAID,
"D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN."

04:10.981 --> 04:14.254
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD...

04:14.254 --> 04:17.257
(whoosh)
MASKED GUNMEN WERE COMING
INTO THE OFFICE.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.990
MAYBE D. GIBBONS
IS CONNECTED TO 'EM.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.333
YOU THINK WHOEVER'S
SUPPOSED TO BE AFTER YOU

04:22.333 --> 04:25.466
WILL COME AFTER CHARLIE?
WHAT IF THIS WHOLE INVESTIGATION
CIRCLES BACK ON ME?

04:25.466 --> 04:28.268
WELL, ISN'T THAT ALWAYS THE RISK
WITH YOUR LINE OF WORK?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.971
AND SHOULDN'T YOU BE TALKING
TO SOMEBODY DOWN AT YOUR OFFICE?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.973
BLACKOUT'S CHANGED
EVERYTHING.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.477
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'D DO--
FATHER TO FATHER.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.979
IF SOMEONE'S GONNA
HURT YOUR FAMILY,

04:38.979 --> 04:41.752
THE BEST THING TO DO IS
CATCH 'EM BEFORE THEY CAN.

04:41.752 --> 04:43.754
THE WORLD'S CHANGED.

04:43.754 --> 04:45.916
MAYBE THE RULES NEED
TO CHANGE A LITTLE, TOO.

04:45.916 --> 04:48.919
IF IT WERE UP TO ME,
I'D DO WHATEVER I HAD TO DO.

04:51.822 --> 04:54.825
(jet engine revving)

04:59.600 --> 05:03.534
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:03.534 --> 05:07.007
(bell chimes)
(man) FLIGHT ATTENDANTS, PLEASE
PREPARE THE CABIN FOR TAKEOFF.

05:07.007 --> 05:10.781
SO ARE YOU FLYING
TO HOME OR FROM?

05:10.781 --> 05:13.384
TO. BACK TO MY FIANCÃ©.

05:13.384 --> 05:15.886
I'VE BEEN STUCK HERE
SINCE THE BLACKOUT.

05:15.886 --> 05:18.889
BUT NOW THAT THE AIRLINES
ARE UP AND RUNNING AGAIN...
(bell chimes)

05:18.889 --> 05:21.392
I HOPPED ON THE FIRST FLIGHT
THEY WERE OFFERING.

05:21.392 --> 05:23.323
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN SEATTLE?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.396
I'M A LAWYER--
CRIMINAL DEFENSE.

05:25.396 --> 05:27.728
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHY ARE YOU FLYING?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.830
I HAVE TO.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.932
I'M THE C.E.O. OF THE AIRLINE.

05:31.932 --> 05:35.536
(jet engines powering up)
ALL THE EXECUTIVES
ARE TAKING FLIGHTS TODAY

05:35.536 --> 05:39.510
TO PROVE TO OUR CUSTOMERS
THAT THE SKIES ARE SAFE AGAIN.

05:39.510 --> 05:41.942
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT
FOR YOU?

05:41.942 --> 05:43.444
GANGBUSTERS.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.446
ANOTHER SCOTCH.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.449
(jet engines revving)

05:52.883 --> 05:55.456
(indistinct conversations)

05:55.456 --> 05:56.827
AL.

05:56.827 --> 05:58.358
YO.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.131
CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR?
SURE. WHAT DO YOU NEED?

06:01.131 --> 06:02.933
I GOT A CALL LAST NIGHT
FROM AN UNKNOWN NUMBER.

06:02.933 --> 06:05.466
CAN YOU HAVE THE TECH GUYS
BACK-TRACE IT

06:05.466 --> 06:07.938
THROUGH THE CARRIER
AND SEE IF THEY CAN IDENTIFY

06:07.938 --> 06:10.901
THE CELL SITES
IT WAS ROUTED THROUGH?
WHAT'S THE PRIORITY ON THIS?

06:10.901 --> 06:13.444
NUCLEAR.

06:15.846 --> 06:19.610
HOW'S IT GOING?
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY--
I MISS THE GOOD, OLD DAYS

06:19.610 --> 06:22.413
WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT
DIDN'T SHARE THEIR LEADS

06:22.413 --> 06:23.884
WITH EACH OTHER.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.687
WE'RE GONNA BE CASHING IN
OUR PENSIONS BEFORE WE FINISH

06:26.687 --> 06:28.789
SIFTING THROUGH
ALL OF THIS INTEL.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.090
KINGDOM OF TONGA?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.763
NOW WHO KNEW THEY EVEN HAD
AN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY?

06:32.763 --> 06:34.925
THEY'RE BLAMING
THE FLASH-FORWARDS

06:34.925 --> 06:36.497
ON PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.969
WELL, I'LL SEE YOUR BORING
AND RAISE YOU AN INSANE.

06:38.969 --> 06:42.473
"THE FLASH-FORWARDS WERE
CAUSED BY A TOXIC GAS

06:42.473 --> 06:44.805
"THAT WAS RELEASED FROM DEEP
WITHIN THE EARTH

06:44.805 --> 06:46.837
AS A RESULT
OF CRUSTAL RIFTING."

06:46.837 --> 06:49.640
SO THE EARTH FARTED,
AND WE BLACKED OUT.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.642
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.
(chuckles)

06:51.642 --> 06:54.815
AT LEAST THIS ONE'S VETTED
BY OUR LEGATES IN GERMANY.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.947
APPARENTLY THERE'S
A-A PRISONER, A FORMER NAZI--

06:56.947 --> 07:00.921
A RUDOLF GEYER--WHO'S CLAIMING
TO KNOW WHY THE BLACKOUTS

07:00.921 --> 07:03.654
LASTED EXACTLY 137 SEKUNDEN.

07:03.654 --> 07:05.956
SEKUNDEN.
THAT'S GERMAN FOR "SECONDS."

07:05.956 --> 07:07.998
(whoosh)

07:10.601 --> 07:12.933
WAIT A MINUTE.
THE GUY WHO SENT THIS IN--

07:12.933 --> 07:15.165
DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.911
THAT'S HIM.
HE WAS ON MY BOARD.

07:20.911 --> 07:23.574
WE GOTTA FOLLOW UP ON THIS.

07:23.574 --> 07:26.977
BASED ON WHAT, MARK--
YOUR SPIDEY SENSE?

07:26.977 --> 07:28.979
SOMETHING SPOOKIER.

07:28.979 --> 07:31.752
THE NAZI'S REPORT...

07:31.752 --> 07:33.984
MENTIONS MARK BY NAME.

07:45.496 --> 07:47.498
LET ME SEE
IF I GOT THIS RIGHT.

07:47.498 --> 07:50.000
WE GOT AGENTS WORKING 24/7
TO IDENTIFY THE TWO GUYS

07:50.000 --> 07:52.002
WHO WERE AWAKE
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

07:52.002 --> 07:53.504
THIS WEEK ALONE
I'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT

07:53.504 --> 07:55.706
HOW TO EULOGIZE
EIGHT DEAD AGENTS,

07:55.706 --> 07:58.779
AND YOU WANT TO FLY TO GERMANY
TO TALK TO A NAZI?

07:58.779 --> 08:01.081
WELL, A FORMER NAZI.

08:01.081 --> 08:05.185
WELL, THAT JUST MAKES ME FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER.
GEYER REQUESTED A MEETING
WITH ME SPECIFICALLY.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.989
HOW DOES HE EVEN KNOW YOU?
I HAVE NO IDEA,
BUT HE SAYS HE CAN EXPLAIN

08:08.989 --> 08:10.991
WHY THE BLACKOUT
LASTED 137 SECONDS,

08:10.991 --> 08:14.765
AND HE WON'T TALK UNLESS
I SEE HIM FACE-TO-FACE.

08:14.765 --> 08:16.767
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU'RE GETTING NOWHERE

08:16.767 --> 08:19.900
WITH TRACKING DOWN
SUSPECT ZERO OR D. GIBBONS.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.833
N.S.A.'s STILL WORKING
ON THE SUSPECT ZERO VIDEO.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.975
AND WE'RE RUNNING DOWN
DIGITAL FORENSICS

08:24.975 --> 08:26.977
FROM D. GIBBONS' CELL PHONE.
FOR ALL WE KNOW,

08:26.977 --> 08:30.040
IT'S GEYER'S INFORMATION
THAT WILL LEAD US TO THEM.

08:34.284 --> 08:36.647
BOOK THE FLIGHTS.

08:36.647 --> 08:38.849
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

08:43.293 --> 08:47.958
...FROM NEW YORK KENNEDY
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT...

08:47.958 --> 08:50.831
(continues indistinctly)

08:57.968 --> 09:00.671
I THOUGHT I WAS NEVER
GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

09:00.671 --> 09:02.673
ME, TOO.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.720
SO CAN I TELL YOU NOW?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.752
TELL ME WHAT?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.854
WHAT I SAW
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.555
ZO--

09:15.555 --> 09:17.027
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, BABE?

09:17.027 --> 09:20.030
IT'S NOT LIKE WE DIDN'T SEE
THE SAME THING.

09:20.030 --> 09:24.334
HERE. WE COULD TALK, OR...

09:24.334 --> 09:26.667
OR?
OR WE COULD GO TO A MOTEL...

09:26.667 --> 09:29.569
OH! I LIKE YOUR THINKING,
STRANGER. (laughs)
(laughs)

09:43.814 --> 09:46.286
(bottles clink)

09:46.286 --> 09:49.219
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

09:49.219 --> 09:53.223
JUST A SODA WATER, KATE.

09:55.666 --> 09:57.698
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:57.698 --> 10:01.772
OUR DAUGHTER'S ALIVE, KATE.

10:01.772 --> 10:04.204
I SAW HER
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.376
IN MY VISION,
I WAS WITH HER.

10:06.376 --> 10:08.178
SHE WAS WOUNDED.

10:08.178 --> 10:11.311
I TH--I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN SOMEWHERE IN AFGHANISTAN.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.884
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WEREN'T DEAD?

10:13.884 --> 10:15.886
MAYBE YOU WERE
IN HEAVEN WITH HER.

10:15.886 --> 10:18.148
HEY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK
ON THAT WITH YOUR HIGHER POWER.

10:18.148 --> 10:20.821
I'M SERIOUS, KATE. YOU KNOW
WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.724
THIS THING IS REAL--
GLIMPSES OF WHAT'S TO COME.
(chuckles)

10:23.724 --> 10:26.857
WHAT'S TO COME?

10:26.857 --> 10:29.700
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SAW?

10:29.700 --> 10:31.031
THIS.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.133
I WAS DOING THE SAME THING
I'M DOING NOW,

10:33.133 --> 10:36.006
SAME THING I'VE BEEN DOING
THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

10:36.006 --> 10:40.010
AND THOSE SORRY-ASS REGULARS
THERE? THEY WERE HERE, TOO.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.312
WHAT YOU SAW WAS
WISHFUL THINKING.

10:42.312 --> 10:44.144
LET HER GO, AARON.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.316
I CAN'T.
NOT WHEN I KNOW SHE NEEDS ME.

10:46.316 --> 10:49.950
SHE'S OUT THERE. I'M POSITIVE.
SHE'S DEAD! SHE'S BURIED!

10:49.950 --> 10:51.982
THIS ISN'T ABOUT SOME VISION.

10:51.982 --> 10:54.654
THIS IS ABOUT YOU COMING UP
WITH A FANTASY

10:54.654 --> 10:56.326
BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY,
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE REASON

10:56.326 --> 10:58.829
SHE WENT INTO THE MILITARY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

10:58.829 --> 11:00.761
NO, OF COURSE IT IS.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.064
SHE'S DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL,
FOLLOWING IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.066
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
ANYWAY?

11:06.066 --> 11:08.068
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME,
ANYWAY?
HEY.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.070
STOP. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.302
I JUST WANT YOUR SIGNATURE.

11:12.302 --> 11:15.075
I NEED YOU TO SIGN
AN AFFIDAVIT

11:15.075 --> 11:17.978
SO I CAN EXHUME
HER REMAINS.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.080
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET IT, AARON.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.814
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAKE THIS AND GO?

11:23.814 --> 11:27.017
I'M GONNA FIND HER, KATE,
WHETHER YOU HELP ME OR NOT.

11:27.017 --> 11:30.390
AND WHEN I DO,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.093
(Zoey and Demetri chuckle)

11:33.093 --> 11:35.996
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
I'VE BLACKED OUT THIS WEEK.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.327
(both laugh)

11:42.002 --> 11:44.134
NOW CAN I TELL YOU
ABOUT WHAT I SAW?

11:44.134 --> 11:47.738
OKAY.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.812
IT WAS OUR WEDDING.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.014
IT WAS ON A BEACH--

11:54.014 --> 11:56.947
HAMOA BEACH IN HAWAII, I THINK,
WHERE WE WENT LAST SPRING.

11:56.947 --> 12:02.993
(whoosh)

12:02.993 --> 12:05.325
IT WAS SO PEACEFUL.
THE WIND AND--

12:05.325 --> 12:07.497
AND THE WAVES...
(whoosh)

12:07.497 --> 12:11.161
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.

12:11.161 --> 12:14.164
AND YOU SAW ME THERE?
YEAH.

12:16.206 --> 12:18.008
DID YOU SEE ME?

12:18.008 --> 12:21.271
YEAH.

12:21.271 --> 12:25.415
OF COURSE I SAW YOU...

12:25.415 --> 12:28.048
IN THAT WHITE DRESS...

12:28.048 --> 12:30.120
(whispers) BAREFOOT.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.482
BABY,
YOU WERE SO BEAUTIFUL.

12:34.885 --> 12:37.988
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU DESCRIBED.

12:37.988 --> 12:41.061
YOU REALIZE THAT'S GONNA BE
OUR WEDDING DAY, DON'T YOU?

12:41.061 --> 12:45.065
APRIL 29th? D-DAY?

12:45.065 --> 12:48.839
ALL THAT'S HAPPENED, BABY,
I'M NOT SURE WE SHOULD...

12:48.839 --> 12:51.071
COMMIT TO A DATE.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.073
WE ALREADY HAVE.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.045
SO...

12:55.045 --> 12:57.077
CAN'T YOU JUST...

12:57.077 --> 13:00.150
FALL BACK...

13:00.150 --> 13:02.512
LET THE FUTURE HAPPEN

13:02.512 --> 13:04.514
LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO?

13:19.930 --> 13:22.933
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:31.982 --> 13:33.844
WELCOME TO MUNICH.

13:33.844 --> 13:35.846
AGENT BENFORD, AGENT HAWK.

13:35.846 --> 13:39.089
STEFAN KRIEGER.

13:39.089 --> 13:42.252
I'LL BE YOUR B.N.D. LIAISON
DURING YOUR STAY.

13:42.252 --> 13:45.595
THANKS FOR ARRANGING THIS
MEETING ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

13:45.595 --> 13:48.859
YOU'RE HERE AS GUESTS
OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.

13:48.859 --> 13:50.861
AS SUCH, YOU HAVE
NO ACTUAL AUTHORITY

13:50.861 --> 13:53.833
AND WILL PROCEED WITH
APPROPRIATE DECORUM. AGREED?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.005
AGREED.

13:55.005 --> 13:57.908
THERE ARE A LOT
OF GHOSTS HERE.

13:57.908 --> 13:59.910
ISN'T THIS WHERE SOPHIE SCHOLL

13:59.910 --> 14:02.242
AND THE REST OF THE WHITE ROSE
NAZI RESISTANCE GROUP

14:02.242 --> 14:04.844
WERE EXECUTED?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.017
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
YOUR COUNTRY ERADICATED

14:07.017 --> 14:09.019
ITS INDIGENOUS
INDIAN POPULATION

14:09.019 --> 14:14.054
AND PRACTICED INSTITUTIONALIZED
SLAVERY FOR OVER 250 YEARS.

14:14.054 --> 14:17.157
WE ALSO GAVE THE WORLD
BRITNEY SPEARS.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.588
(clank)

14:18.588 --> 14:20.590
RUDOLF GEYER
MAY PRESENT HIMSELF

14:20.590 --> 14:23.533
AS A FRAIL,
FORGETFUL OLD MAN,

14:23.533 --> 14:26.366
BUT I SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT
HE MANAGED TO ELUDE CAPTURE

14:26.366 --> 14:28.368
FOR MORE
THAN HALF A CENTURY,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.370
SPENDING AT LEAST
20 OF THOSE YEARS

14:30.370 --> 14:35.005
WITHIN YOUR OWN U.S. BORDERS.
HE'S AN UNREPENTANT MURDERER.

14:35.005 --> 14:36.646
HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE

14:36.646 --> 14:39.049
HAS BEEN BASED ON DISSEMBLANCE
AND FALSEHOOD.

14:39.049 --> 14:41.451
NEVER FORGET THAT.

14:41.451 --> 14:43.053
(door clanks)

14:45.355 --> 14:46.987
HERR GEYER.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.025
GENTLEMEN...

14:55.025 --> 14:57.397
AND LADY.

14:59.269 --> 15:04.174
I'VE LOOKED FORWARD TO
MEETING YOU, HERR BENFORD.

15:06.076 --> 15:07.337
(whoosh)

15:17.047 --> 15:21.521
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME?
I SAW IT IN MY VISION.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.955
YOU SAID YOU HAD INFORMATION
ABOUT THE FLASH-FORWARD,

15:24.955 --> 15:26.596
ABOUT HOW LONG THEY LASTED.

15:26.596 --> 15:29.459
IT'S NOT QUITE
THAT SIMPLE, I'M AFRAID.

15:29.459 --> 15:32.662
YOU SEE, BEFORE
MY UNFORTUNATE INCARCERATION,

15:32.662 --> 15:34.634
I LIVED IN AMERICA,

15:34.634 --> 15:38.608
AND I LEARNED HOW YOU CAN'T
GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.

15:38.608 --> 15:40.640
WE'VE ANTICIPATED THIS,
HERR GEYER.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.612
UPON VERIFICATION
OF YOUR INFORMATION,

15:42.612 --> 15:46.676
YOU WILL BE TRANSFERRED
TO A MINIMUM SECURITY FACILITY.

15:46.676 --> 15:48.678
(speaks German)

15:48.678 --> 15:52.983
BUT I HAD MORE
THAN A GESTURE IN MIND.

15:52.983 --> 15:55.685
I WANT TO RETURN TO AMERICA,

15:55.685 --> 15:59.029
AND ALL CHARGES AGAINST ME

15:59.029 --> 16:00.390
ARE DROPPED.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.068
YOU'RE DREAMING.
I'M NOT PERMITTING MY CLIENT TO
BREATHE A WORD OF WHAT HE KNOWS

16:08.068 --> 16:12.142
WITHOUT GETTING
HIS PARDON FIRST.

16:12.142 --> 16:15.605
I BELIEVE WE HAVE
WHAT'S CALLED

16:15.605 --> 16:17.177
A GAME OF CHICKEN.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.380
WHO DO YOU THINK
WILL BLINK FIRST?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.682
BEFORE YOU ANSWER,
CONSIDER THE FACT

16:22.682 --> 16:25.085
THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

16:28.418 --> 16:30.320
HE'S PLAYING US.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.123
THINK ABOUT IT.
THIS IS WIN-WIN FOR HIM.

16:33.123 --> 16:35.995
AT BEST,
HE'S JUST JERKING US AROUND

16:35.995 --> 16:39.129
FOR A FEW DAYS' ENTERTAINMENT,
AND AT WORST HE GOES FREE,

16:39.129 --> 16:41.271
AND WE HAVE NO--
WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COVER
OURSELVES IF HE'S LYING.

16:41.271 --> 16:42.772
NO, YOU HEARD HIS LAWYER.

16:42.772 --> 16:44.774
THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET US
COVER OURSELVES.

16:44.774 --> 16:47.307
MARK, THIS IS FULL PARDON
OR NOTHING,

16:47.307 --> 16:50.009
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT GEYER'S GONNA GIVE US.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.
THE ONLY THING WE KNOW IS

16:50.009 --> 16:52.482
GEYER'S IMPORTANT TO OUR CASE
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,

16:52.482 --> 16:54.484
WHICH MEANS, JANIS--
YEAH, LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

16:54.484 --> 16:57.187
I AM LISTENING.
MARK, SIX MONTHS FROM NOW?
COME ON.

16:57.187 --> 17:00.050
THE ONLY THING WE KNOW RIGHT NOW
IS HOW MUCH WE DON'T KNOW.

17:00.050 --> 17:03.123
MARK, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
LETTING A MASS MURDERER GO FREE

17:03.123 --> 17:05.425
IN EXCHANGE FOR
POTENTIALLY NOTHING.

17:05.425 --> 17:09.028
JANIS, THERE ARE
SEVERAL BILLION PEOPLE--

17:09.028 --> 17:10.660
SEVERAL BILLION--
WHO NEED ANSWERS.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.402
THAT'S NOT NOTHING.

17:12.402 --> 17:14.404
THEY NEED TO KNOW
WHY IT HAPPENED,

17:14.404 --> 17:16.406
WHETHER IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN.

17:16.406 --> 17:18.408
THE GUY MAKES ME SICK.

17:18.408 --> 17:21.341
BUT HE'S 86 YEARS OLD.
HE'S ON HIS WAY OUT.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.214
AND AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO
PERSONALLY HELP HIM ON HIS WAY,

17:24.214 --> 17:27.217
I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF IF THE ENDS
DON'T JUSTIFY THE MEANS HERE.

17:27.217 --> 17:30.380
THEY NEVER DO, MARK.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.422
AND YOU KNOW,
GEYER'S AGE IS IRRELEVANT.

17:32.422 --> 17:35.185
THERE'S NO STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS ON EVIL.

17:35.185 --> 17:37.527
GEYER DESERVES HIS PUNISHMENT,
AND HIS VICTIMS DESERVE

17:37.527 --> 17:39.529
HIM GETTING THAT PUNISHMENT,

17:39.529 --> 17:43.133
AND YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM THEM ON A HOPE.

17:45.135 --> 17:47.437
(woman) SO HOW'S MARK
HANDLING ALL OF THIS?

17:47.437 --> 17:49.769
THE USUAL WAY--
THROWING HIMSELF INTO WORK.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.771
HOW ABOUT STAN?
THE SAME.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.773
SINCE BECOMING
BUREAU ASSISTANT DIRECTOR,

17:53.773 --> 17:56.446
HE'S CONVINCED HE HAS
TO WORK TWICE AS HARD

17:56.446 --> 17:58.848
AS EVERYBODY ELSE
IN THE BUREAU.
MM.

17:58.848 --> 18:01.111
HE'S PULLED
TWO ALL-NIGHTERS IN A ROW,

18:01.111 --> 18:04.514
WORKING ON THIS EULOGY
FOR THE--THE MEMORIAL SERVICE.

18:04.514 --> 18:07.357
LIKE IF HE FOUND
JUST THE RIGHT WORDS,

18:07.357 --> 18:11.161
HE COULD BRING THESE AGENTS
BACK TO LIFE.
WELL, MARK'S CONVINCED THAT WHAT
HE SAW IN HIS FLASH-FORWARD

18:11.161 --> 18:13.693
IS SOMEHOW GOING
TO SAVE US ALL.
SO MARK SAW HIMSELF
SAVING THE WORLD,

18:13.693 --> 18:15.795
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?

18:15.795 --> 18:17.797
(whoosh)
HEY, HONEY.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.799
NOTHING IMPORTANT.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.631
HOW ABOUT YOU?

18:21.631 --> 18:23.633
I WAS HOME.

18:23.633 --> 18:27.277
I WAS IN JASON'S ROOM,
BUT ALL OF HIS STUFF WAS GONE.

18:27.277 --> 18:30.580
THAT MAKES SENSE.
HE'S IN COLLEGE, RIGHT?
HE STILL COMES HOME
FOR HOLIDAYS.

18:30.580 --> 18:33.112
BUT IN MY VISION,
EVERYTHING WAS GONE

18:33.112 --> 18:36.186
AND REPLACED BY
A YOUNG BOY'S THINGS.

18:36.186 --> 18:39.649
HE WAS ABOUT 8 OR 9 YEARS OLD,
AND I WAS PUTTING HIM TO BED.

18:39.649 --> 18:41.351
GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

18:41.351 --> 18:43.693
GOOD NIGHT, ATTAF.

18:43.693 --> 18:45.855
(Olivia) AND YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN THIS KID BEFORE?

18:45.855 --> 18:48.658
NO. NO, NEVER.

18:48.658 --> 18:51.761
LOOK, PEOPLE ARE SAYING
THESE VISIONS ARE REAL.

18:51.761 --> 18:53.903
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS,

18:53.903 --> 18:56.836
THIS LITTLE BOY'S GONNA
COME INTO MY LIFE,

18:56.836 --> 18:59.869
AND I'M GONNA BE HIS MOM.
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE

18:59.869 --> 19:02.872
THESE VISIONS ARE RANDOM.

19:02.872 --> 19:05.845
THERE IS A PURPOSE.
I JUST--I KNOW IT.

19:08.678 --> 19:11.221
(Geyer) WE HAVE
A COMPROMISE TO SUGGEST--

19:11.221 --> 19:13.323
ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION NOW

19:13.323 --> 19:15.154
AND ONE LATER.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.756
AN OFFER OF PROOF.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.230
YOU VERIFY CERTAIN ASPECTS
OF MY CLIENT'S FLASH-FORWARD,

19:20.230 --> 19:21.831
PARDON HIM.

19:21.831 --> 19:26.766
THEN HE WILL GIVE YOU
THE REMAINDER OF WHAT HE KNOWS.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.399
FINE.

19:29.399 --> 19:32.202
THE 137 SECONDS--WHY?

19:32.202 --> 19:35.745
IN MY TIME AT TREBLINKA,

19:35.745 --> 19:40.680
I, UH, OBVIOUSLY CAME
INTO CONTACT WITH MANY JEWS.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.214
I ALSO CAME TO LEARN
ABOUT CERTAIN ASPECTS

19:44.214 --> 19:47.687
OF THEIR BELIEFS,
THEIR CULTURE--
IS THIS GOING SOMEWHERE?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.819
EH...

19:49.819 --> 19:54.224
TELL ME, MISS HAWK, WHY DO YOU
WEAR A RING ON YOUR LEFT THUMB?

19:56.266 --> 19:59.198
WHAT'S IT MATTER?

19:59.198 --> 20:02.232
IN SOME EASTERN EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES,

20:02.232 --> 20:05.705
UH, WHERE HOMOSEXUALITY
IS ILLEGAL,

20:05.705 --> 20:09.439
A RING ON A WOMAN'S LEFT THUMB
IS CONSIDERED AN INDICATION

20:09.439 --> 20:12.442
OF HER PROCLIVITIES.

20:12.442 --> 20:14.844
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

20:14.844 --> 20:16.986
EVERYTHING AND NOTHING.

20:16.986 --> 20:21.291
I AM MERELY REFERENCING
A CERTAIN KIND OF CODE.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.394
I WILL NOW MAKE A REFERENCE
TO ANOTHER KIND OF CODE.

20:24.394 --> 20:26.225
HAVE YOU HEARD OF KABBALAH?

20:26.225 --> 20:29.459
IT'S A SET
OF ESOTERIC TEACHINGS--

20:29.459 --> 20:30.700
JEWISH MYSTICISM.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.502
IN KABBALAH,

20:32.502 --> 20:35.365
EVERYTHING HAS
A HIDDEN MEANING.

20:35.365 --> 20:39.339
THIS IS THE WORD
SPELLED IN HEBREW...

20:39.339 --> 20:41.741
QOF, BEIT,

20:41.741 --> 20:44.744
LAMED, HEI.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.847
AND EACH LETTER
IN THE HEBREW ALPHABET

20:47.847 --> 20:51.020
IS ASCRIBED A NUMBER.

20:51.020 --> 20:53.953
AND IF YOU ADD UP
THESE NUMBERS,

20:53.953 --> 20:56.926
YOU ARRIVE AT 137--

20:56.926 --> 21:01.591
EXACTLY THE NUMBER OF SECONDS
THAT THE BLACKOUT LASTED.

21:01.591 --> 21:03.593
(pounds table)
LISTEN TO ME.

21:03.593 --> 21:06.636
THE ONLY REASON I'M SHARING
THE SAME AIR AS YOU IS BECAUSE

21:06.636 --> 21:10.039
YOU SAID YOU'VE GOT
RELEVANT INFORMATION.

21:10.039 --> 21:12.972
AND YOU'VE GOT EXACTLY
ONE MINUTE TO PROVE THAT TO ME,

21:12.972 --> 21:14.674
OR I'M GONE.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.647
YOU WON'T LEAVE.
NOT YET.

21:17.647 --> 21:22.882
I HAVE INFORMATION THAT'LL PROVE
CRUCIAL TO YOUR INVESTIGATION.

21:22.882 --> 21:27.016
AND I KNOW IT,
BECAUSE IN MY FLASH-FORWARD...

21:27.016 --> 21:30.790
I WAS BEING REPATRIATED

21:30.790 --> 21:32.692
TO THE UNITED STATES,

21:32.692 --> 21:35.925
AND I HAD BOUGHT MY FREEDOM

21:35.925 --> 21:40.830
WITH THE SECOND PIECE
OF INFORMATION...

21:40.830 --> 21:44.003
WHICH I AM PREPARED
TO SHARE WITH YOU.

21:46.336 --> 21:48.077
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

21:48.077 --> 21:51.611
(whoosh)
I WAS IN AN AMERICAN AIRPORT.

21:51.611 --> 21:56.045
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE. I WAS
CLEARING THROUGH IMMIGRATION.
THANK YOU.

21:56.045 --> 21:59.419
THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO
WAS PROCESSING MY DOCUMENTS.

21:59.419 --> 22:03.593
I REMEMBER HE HAD A NAMETAG
THAT READ "J. MURPHY."

22:03.593 --> 22:07.757
DISAPPOINTING AGENT BENFORD'S
NOT HERE TO WELCOME ME HOME.

22:07.757 --> 22:09.529
(laughs)

22:09.529 --> 22:12.502
(German accent) COMING BACK
FROM GERMANY, JA?

22:12.502 --> 22:15.535
RETURNING HOME, ACTUALLY,

22:15.535 --> 22:18.538
AND I HAVE ONE MURDER
TO THANK FOR IT.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.871
A MURDER? WHOSE MURDER?

22:23.943 --> 22:26.015
THIS IS JUST
OUR OFFER OF PROOF.

22:26.015 --> 22:28.778
LOCATE THIS CUSTOMS AGENT,
THIS J. MURPHY.

22:28.778 --> 22:32.682
COMPARE HIS FLASH-FORWARD
TO MY CLIENT'S.

22:32.682 --> 22:35.985
CONFIRM HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.
ARE YOU ENJOYING WATCHING US

22:35.985 --> 22:38.127
JUMP THROUGH YOUR HOOPS?
I HOPE YOU ARE.

22:38.127 --> 22:40.530
BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER LEAVING
THIS PRISON, GEYER.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.992
I WILL LEAVE...

22:42.992 --> 22:47.767
ON APRIL 29th, 2010.

22:47.767 --> 22:51.541
IT IS A FUTURE THAT
HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.755
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE RUNNING WITH THIS.

23:05.755 --> 23:08.588
LET'S JUST SEE IF
HIS FLASH-FORWARD PROVES OUT.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.661
IF IT DOES, IT MEANS GEYER'S
FREE IN SIX MONTHS' TIME,

23:11.661 --> 23:14.063
WHICH MEANS
HE'S TELLING US THE TRUTH.
OR A LIE WE BELIEVED.

23:14.063 --> 23:16.125
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS?

23:16.125 --> 23:18.898
(cell phone rings)

23:18.898 --> 23:20.069
(beep)

23:20.069 --> 23:21.400
BENFORD.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.402
HEY, IT'S ME.
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.404
Just. What's up?

23:25.404 --> 23:28.478
I NEED A FAVOR--
A BIG FAVOR.

23:28.478 --> 23:30.980
IT'S FOR TRACY.

23:30.980 --> 23:32.882
I want to get
her remains exhumed,

23:32.882 --> 23:34.884
test 'em against the D.N.A.

23:34.884 --> 23:36.986
the military's got
on file for her.
AARON.

23:36.986 --> 23:38.918
TELL YOU WHAT--I'LL LISTEN

23:38.918 --> 23:41.691
TO ANY "THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA"
SPEECHES YOU GOTTA GIVE

23:41.691 --> 23:43.893
if you can swear you wouldn't
do the exact same thing

23:43.893 --> 23:46.756
if it were Charlie.
OKAY.
YOU FAX OVER THE PAPERWORK.

23:46.756 --> 23:49.859
I'LL PUSH IT THROUGH.
There's no paperwork,

23:49.859 --> 23:52.001
'CAUSE IT'S NOT SIGNED,
AND IT'S NOT SIGNED

23:52.001 --> 23:55.465
'CAUSE IT NEEDS
KATE'S SIGNATURE.

23:55.465 --> 23:58.538
I need you to push through
more than paperwork here.
AARON, THAT'S--

23:58.538 --> 24:02.872
I SAID IT WAS A BIG FAVOR.
LEAVING ASIDE THE ILLEGALITY,

24:02.872 --> 24:04.844
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT'LL HAPPEN

24:04.844 --> 24:06.846
IF THE RESULTS
COME BACK POSITIVE,

24:06.846 --> 24:09.148
AND THE PERSON IN THAT GRAVE
IS TRACY?

24:09.148 --> 24:14.023
I SAW HER, MARK.
I SAW HER ALIVE.

24:14.023 --> 24:16.526
WHAT YOU SAW WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

24:16.526 --> 24:19.158
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
A LEAP OF FAITH, MARK.

24:19.158 --> 24:23.893
You've never taken
a leap of faith?

24:23.893 --> 24:26.766
MARK, I'M A LITTLE BUSY
RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

24:26.766 --> 24:29.238
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
I'M--I'M JUST...

24:29.238 --> 24:31.501
EVERYTHING'S FINE WITH ZOEY.

24:31.501 --> 24:33.503
LISTEN, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

24:33.503 --> 24:36.706
YOU TELL HIM I'LL CALL WHEN
I'VE GOT THE WARRANT. OKAY.

24:36.706 --> 24:40.580
A WARRANT?
FOR A CUSTOMS OFFICER?
NO, THAT'S... SOMETHING ELSE.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.052
LISTEN, MARCIE RAN THROUGH
THE T.S.A. EMPLOYEE DATABASE,

24:43.052 --> 24:45.785
AND THERE AREN'T ANY
J. MURPHYS WORKING CUSTOMS

24:45.785 --> 24:49.889
AT ANY OF THE AIRPORTS IN
THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES.
DID YOU CHECK APPLICANTS?

24:49.889 --> 24:52.892
NO. GEYER SAID HE SPOKE
TO AN ACTUAL OFFICER.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.193
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.025
OUR GUY MIGHT NOT
BE WORKING CUSTOMS YET.

24:56.025 --> 25:00.129
HAVE MARCIE CHECK. IF SHE
FINDS SOMETHING, RUN IT DOWN.

25:00.129 --> 25:04.273
THERE A PROBLEM?
MY HEAD'S JUST NOT
IN THE GAME TODAY, BOSS.

25:04.273 --> 25:06.275
DEMETRI?
YEAH.

25:06.275 --> 25:09.609
GET IT IN THE GAME.

25:16.646 --> 25:19.689
(K.C. & the Sunshine Band)
â™ª I WANT TO PUT ON â™ª

25:19.689 --> 25:21.851
â™ª MY MY MY MY MY BOOGIE SHOES â™ª

25:21.851 --> 25:22.992
HELLO?

25:22.992 --> 25:25.695
â™ª JUST TO BOOGIE WITH YOU â™ª

25:25.695 --> 25:29.959
â™ª I WANT TO DO IT
TILL THE SUN COMES UP â™ª

25:29.959 --> 25:31.300
HELLO?

25:31.300 --> 25:34.203
â™ª OH, YEAH â™ª

25:34.203 --> 25:35.905
â™ª I WANT TO DO IT TILL â™ª

25:35.905 --> 25:37.907
HELLO?

25:37.907 --> 25:40.610
â™ª YEAH, YEAH â™ª

25:40.610 --> 25:44.674
â™ª OH! I WANT TO PUT ON â™ª

25:44.674 --> 25:46.676
â™ª MY MY MY MY MY BOOGIE SHOES â™ª

25:46.676 --> 25:48.277
â™ª JUST TO BOOGIE WITH YOU â™ª

25:48.277 --> 25:49.919
HEY.

25:49.919 --> 25:52.081
â™ª I WANT TO PUT ON â™ª

25:52.081 --> 25:54.253
HEY! JEROME MURPHY?

25:54.253 --> 25:56.125
FBI. HAVE A MINUTE?

25:56.125 --> 25:58.127
â™ª WHOO! â™ª
(music stops)

25:58.127 --> 26:00.189
(panting) LIKE,
YOU'RE SAYING I MAKE IT?

26:00.189 --> 26:02.061
I'M GONNA BE
A CUSTOMS OFFICIAL?

26:02.061 --> 26:05.995
MAN, I SAW IT, BUT I DIDN'T
REALLY BELIEVE IT, YOU KNOW?

26:05.995 --> 26:09.038
THIS ROCKS, DUDE. I TOTALLY
THOUGHT I BLEW THE PHYSICAL.

26:09.038 --> 26:12.972
DO I GET A GUN AND STUFF?
JEROME, I NEED YOU
TO FOCUS HERE, OKAY?

26:12.972 --> 26:15.905
I'M TRYING TO CORROBORATE
A SUSPECT'S FLASH-FORWARD,

26:15.905 --> 26:18.177
AND HE CLAIMS
THAT YOU WERE IN IT.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.750
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:20.750 --> 26:23.052
YEAH, SURE. NO PROBLEM.

26:23.052 --> 26:25.915
WHAT'S "CORROBORATE" MEAN?
(clears throat)

26:25.915 --> 26:29.018
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME WHETHER
YOU SAW THE SAME THING

26:29.018 --> 26:33.222
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD AS
THIS GUY CLAIMS HE SAW IN HIS.

26:33.222 --> 26:35.725
(gasps) I KNOW THAT DUDE.

26:35.725 --> 26:38.728
I WAS WORKING IN AN AIRPORT.
IT FELT GOOD, YOU KNOW?

26:38.728 --> 26:43.102
(stamps twice)
BADGE... UNIFORM...

26:43.102 --> 26:45.334
IT GAVE ME PURPOSE.

26:45.334 --> 26:49.138
(German accent) COMING BACK
FROM GERMANY, JA? (laughs)

26:49.138 --> 26:53.082
I WOKE UP AFTER THE BLACKOUT,
APPLIED THE NEXT DAY.
(whoosh)

26:53.082 --> 26:55.685
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE,
ANYTHING ODD?

26:55.685 --> 26:58.047
YOU KNOW, COME TO THINK OF IT,
HE DID.

26:58.047 --> 27:00.349
HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A MURDER.
I HAVE A MURDER
TO THANK FOR IT.

27:00.349 --> 27:02.652
I FIGURED
I JUST MISHEARD HIM.

27:02.652 --> 27:05.054
ALL RIGHT.

27:05.054 --> 27:08.097
I MIGHT BE IN TOUCH.
(clatter)

27:08.097 --> 27:10.800
I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.933
THAT'S OKAY.
I KNOW WHAT A BONG IS.
THAT'S NOT MINE.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.666
IT'S... MY ROOMMATE'S.

27:16.666 --> 27:19.969
LOOK, UM, HOME SLICE,

27:19.969 --> 27:23.342
IF I GET TAGGED FOR THIS,
THAT'S IT FOR ME.

27:23.342 --> 27:27.847
THEY WON'T HIRE ME WITH
A DRUG BUST ON MY RECORD.
IT DOES SEEM UNLIKELY, YEAH.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.980
BUT I WAS DOING IT.
I SAW MYSELF DOING THE JOB.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.952
I SAW MYSELF
WEARING THE UNIFORM,

27:32.952 --> 27:35.184
AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF YOU BUST ME.

27:35.184 --> 27:37.987
I MEAN, IT WON'T HAPPEN
IF YOU BUST ME.

27:37.987 --> 27:39.989
I MEAN,
WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS

27:39.989 --> 27:42.992
IT'S UP TO YOU WHETHER OR NOT
MY FUTURE HAPPENS.

27:52.942 --> 27:55.945
(piano music playing)

28:02.752 --> 28:05.815
THANK YOU.

28:05.815 --> 28:07.957
BUY YOU A DRINK?

28:07.957 --> 28:09.418
NO, THANKS.

28:13.092 --> 28:16.325
TO MORAL RELATIVISM.

28:16.325 --> 28:19.068
I'M SORRY THIS IS
BOTHERING YOU SO MUCH.

28:19.068 --> 28:22.271
OH, I'M SORRY THIS ISN'T
BOTHERING YOU AT ALL.

28:22.271 --> 28:24.273
OH, DON'T MAKE THIS PERSONAL.

28:24.273 --> 28:26.435
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T HIDE BEHIND THE BADGE.

28:26.435 --> 28:28.707
YOU'RE THE ONE DRIVING
THIS THING, MARK.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.810
YOU ARE.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.712
JUST OWN IT...

28:33.712 --> 28:35.044
AT LEAST.

28:35.044 --> 28:38.387
FINE.
I'VE BEEN DRIVING THIS.

28:38.387 --> 28:40.389
IT'S WHAT WE DO, JANIS.

28:40.389 --> 28:42.922
WE CUT THE DEALER A PASS
TO GET THE DISTRIBUTOR.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.925
WE LET THE FOOT SOLDIER WALK
TO BUST THE KINGPIN.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.997
BUT THERE HAVE TO BE
SOME LIMITS, MARK.

28:47.997 --> 28:49.929
THERE HAVE TO BE PEOPLE

28:49.929 --> 28:52.231
THAT WE WON'T DEAL
OR FLIP.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.103
AND I'M SORRY,

28:54.103 --> 28:56.065
BUT IF WE CAN'T EVEN
DRAW THAT LINE AT A NAZI...

28:56.065 --> 28:59.438
(scoffs) I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING ANYMORE.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.971
HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN
A LEAP OF FAITH?

29:01.971 --> 29:05.044
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

29:05.044 --> 29:07.216
I'M PUSHING THIS
BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH

29:07.216 --> 29:09.879
THAT SEEING GEYER'S PICTURE
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD

29:09.879 --> 29:12.181
MEANS HIS INFORMATION
WILL BE IMPORTANT TO US.

29:12.181 --> 29:14.183
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
THERE'S OUR PROBLEM,

29:14.183 --> 29:16.055
BECAUSE IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

29:16.055 --> 29:19.358
ALL I SAW WAS A BABY
THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW I WANT.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.360
SO HOW CAN I HAVE FAITH

29:21.360 --> 29:23.893
IN SOMETHING
I'M NOT EVEN SURE IS REAL?

29:23.893 --> 29:25.394
â™ªâ™ª

29:25.394 --> 29:27.967
THEN YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM,

29:27.967 --> 29:31.040
BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT FAITH IS.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.843
(cell phone rings)

29:33.843 --> 29:35.074
(beep)

29:35.074 --> 29:36.545
BENFORD.

29:36.545 --> 29:38.848
DEM FOUND
YOUR NAZI'S CUSTOMS AGENT.

29:38.848 --> 29:40.209
SAME FLASH-FORWARD.

29:40.209 --> 29:43.052
SO HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.
I'll put a call into State,

29:43.052 --> 29:46.385
HAVE THEM START THE ARM-TWISTING
OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.257
YOU SURE?

29:48.257 --> 29:50.259
HELL, NO,
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME

29:50.259 --> 29:53.092
I BETTER GET USED
TO THAT PARTICULAR FEELING.

29:53.092 --> 29:56.125
(Wedeck) WE ALL BETTER.
WORLD'S CHANGED.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.928
SOME OF US, ALL OF US,
ARE MAKING DECISIONS

29:58.928 --> 30:00.930
NOW BASED ON WHAT WILL HAPPEN,

30:00.930 --> 30:02.902
NOT WHAT COULD.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.204
IT MAKES US DO THINGS
WE WOULDN'T ORDINARILY DO.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.539
(Wedeck) YOU'D THINK
KNOWING THE FUTURE

30:10.539 --> 30:13.983
WOULD MAKE US
LESS CONCERNED ABOUT IT.

30:13.983 --> 30:15.985
BUT JUST THE OPPOSITE
HAS HAPPENED.

30:15.985 --> 30:20.089
THE FUTURE'S WHAT ALL OF US
ARE LIVING FOR NOW.

30:20.089 --> 30:22.091
IT'S WHAT WE'RE LIVING BY.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.195
(whoosh)

30:27.897 --> 30:29.058
(whoosh)

30:34.033 --> 30:37.236
(whirring)

30:43.572 --> 30:44.974
(telephone rings)

30:44.974 --> 30:47.316
HEY, D. WE GOT NOTHING
ON YOUR UNKNOWN CALLER.

30:47.316 --> 30:50.279
TECH TRACED IT TO SOMEWHERE
OFF THE NEW YORK COAST,

30:50.279 --> 30:52.281
BUT FROM THERE,
THEY READ THE SIGNAL

30:52.281 --> 30:54.924
AS COMING FROM
TWO DIFFERENT SITES AT ONCE.

30:54.924 --> 30:58.157
WHOEVER IT WAS, THEY KNOW HOW
TO COVER THEIR TRACKS.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.859
THANKS FOR TRYING.

31:02.331 --> 31:04.333
HEY.

31:04.333 --> 31:07.096
CAN YOU PULL THE L.U.D.s
OFF THOSE TWO REPEATER SITES?

31:07.096 --> 31:10.139
THERE'S PROBABLY
A MILLION OR SO CALLS

31:10.139 --> 31:11.600
ROUTED THROUGH THOSE TOWERS.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.972
AT LEAST.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.604
(doors close and open)

31:15.604 --> 31:17.977
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

31:17.977 --> 31:20.149
YOU NEED MY GOVERNMENT'S CONSENT
TO FREE GEYER,

31:20.149 --> 31:23.212
AND MY SUPERIOR--
SIGNED OFF FIVE MINUTES AGO.

31:25.014 --> 31:27.386
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.358
JUST LIKE THAT?

31:29.358 --> 31:31.390
START TALKING.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.263
(chuckles)

31:34.263 --> 31:37.066
I BLACKED OUT, AS WE ALL DID.

31:37.066 --> 31:41.070
THE FLASH-FORWARD HAPPENED
AS I DESCRIBED IT.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.571
AND THEN I WOKE UP.

31:42.571 --> 31:45.034
I WENT TO MY WINDOW,

31:45.034 --> 31:48.677
AND I SAW THE CITY BURNING
IN THE DISTANCE.

31:48.677 --> 31:51.480
AND ON THE GROUND,

31:51.480 --> 31:53.682
IN THE COURTYARD OUTSIDE...

31:56.015 --> 31:58.017
I SAW CROWS.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.049
THEY WERE DEAD.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.255
DEAD CROWS?

32:06.255 --> 32:08.257
THE GROUND
WAS LITTERED WITH THEM.

32:08.257 --> 32:11.300
"A MURDER OF CROWS..."

32:11.300 --> 32:14.603
IN PROPER PARLANCE,
A GROUPING OF CROWS.

32:14.603 --> 32:17.236
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THIS HAVE TO DO

32:17.236 --> 32:20.109
WITH THE KABBALAH
AND 137 SECONDS?
NOTHING, FRAULEIN.

32:20.109 --> 32:25.144
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE BLACKOUT
LASTED AS LONG AS IT DID.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.116
SO WHAT, IT WAS ALL CRAP--

32:27.116 --> 32:29.078
THE KABBALAH, THE BIRDS?

32:29.078 --> 32:32.281
THE CROWS ARE REAL. THEY WERE
DYING OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.

32:32.281 --> 32:35.254
THAT MUST MEAN SOMETHING.
TELL US!

32:35.254 --> 32:38.957
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT I DON'T KNOW.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.361
PLEASE TAKE THIS.
I HAVE NO FURTHER USE FOR IT.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.963
BUT I BELIEVE YOU WILL,
HERR BENFORD.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.696
IN MY VISION,
I KNEW THAT I'D BE FREED

32:47.696 --> 32:51.640
BECAUSE OF WHAT I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE CROWS DYING.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.104
IT COULD BE HELPFUL
IN YOUR INVESTIGATION.

32:55.104 --> 32:58.647
HOW HELPFUL IT WILL BE...
UH, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE.

32:58.647 --> 33:02.211
THEN YOU'LL ROT IN HERE
UNTIL WE DO.

33:02.211 --> 33:08.287
AH, MY ATTORNEY IS HERE
TO PREVENT THAT, HERR KRIEGER.

33:08.287 --> 33:11.020
YOU PLAYED US.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.092
THE FUTURE WILL TELL
WHETHER IT'S TRUE.

33:13.092 --> 33:17.226
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
I AM, AS YOU SAID, HOWEVER...

33:19.168 --> 33:21.700
A FREE MAN.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.442
(Smashing Pumpkins' "To Sheila"
playing)

33:33.442 --> 33:36.685
â™ª TWILIGHT FADES â™ª

33:36.685 --> 33:41.220
â™ª THROUGH BLISTERED AVALON â™ª

33:41.220 --> 33:45.524
â™ª THE SKY'S CRUEL TORCH â™ª

33:45.524 --> 33:50.028
â™ª ON ACHING AUTOBAHN â™ª

33:50.028 --> 33:52.101
â™ª INTO THE UNCERTAIN â™ª

33:52.101 --> 33:53.462
MMM.

33:53.462 --> 33:55.104
â™ª DIVIDE â™ª

33:55.104 --> 33:57.366
HEY. YOU LOOK HORRENDOUS.

33:57.366 --> 34:00.369
GLAD I ACCOMPLISHED AT LEAST
SOMETHING WITH THIS TRIP.

34:00.369 --> 34:02.441
â™ª ...THE LAST DIVINE â™ª

34:02.441 --> 34:04.513
(sighs)
THAT BADLY?

34:04.513 --> 34:09.418
AS BAD AS IT COULD'VE GONE
WITHOUT GETTING SHOT AT, YEAH.

34:09.418 --> 34:12.081
(shoe thuds)

34:12.081 --> 34:15.684
MY MOM--SHE ALWAYS SAYS,
"LIVE IN THE NOW."

34:15.684 --> 34:20.189
HOW THE HELL IS ANYONE
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT ANYMORE?

34:20.189 --> 34:21.360
(shoe thuds)

34:21.360 --> 34:22.691
COME HERE.

34:22.691 --> 34:26.695
â™ª STRONG AS I FEEL â™ª

34:26.695 --> 34:28.537
WHAT YOU DOING?

34:28.537 --> 34:31.140
WHAT AM I DOING?
MM-HMM. WHAT YOU DOING?

34:31.140 --> 34:33.142
LIVING IN THE NOW.
OH.

34:33.142 --> 34:35.144
UH-HUH.
LIVING IN THE NOW.

34:35.144 --> 34:37.106
MM-HMM. (kisses)
(chuckles)

34:37.106 --> 34:39.108
â™ª LATELY I JUST CAN'T SEEM â™ª

34:39.108 --> 34:40.479
MM-HMM.

34:43.412 --> 34:45.114
(kisses)

34:45.114 --> 34:46.755
â™ªâ™ª

34:46.755 --> 34:49.418
MM.
I GUESS MY MOM'S ADVICE
WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL.

34:49.418 --> 34:51.190
NOT SO BAD, HUH?

34:51.190 --> 34:52.221
(chuckles)

34:52.221 --> 34:55.324
â™ªâ™ª

34:56.795 --> 34:58.797
HI, JACK.

35:00.129 --> 35:02.131
HE'S BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE.

35:02.131 --> 35:04.833
HASN'T ASKED ME
TO POUR A DROP.

35:04.833 --> 35:07.836
BUT YOU CAN TELL
HE'S THINKING ABOUT IT HARD.

35:14.643 --> 35:18.647
I CAN'T BE TOO SURE
SINCE I HAD A FEW YESTERDAY,

35:18.647 --> 35:20.649
BUT I THOUGHT I WAS
PRETTY PARTICULAR

35:20.649 --> 35:23.852
ABOUT NOT WANTING
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

35:23.852 --> 35:24.853
YEAH.

35:24.853 --> 35:28.197
WELL...

35:28.197 --> 35:32.201
I FIGURED YOU'D MAKE
AN EXCEPTION FOR--FOR GOOD NEWS.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.535
YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.807
THE BODY--

35:38.807 --> 35:42.911
THE REMAINS.

35:42.911 --> 35:44.913
TRACY'S GRAVE.

35:47.816 --> 35:50.148
YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:55.153 --> 35:59.188
I'M SORRY
I WENT BEHIND YOUR BACK.

35:59.188 --> 36:00.859
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T LISTEN TO YOU.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.832
â™ªâ™ª

36:03.832 --> 36:06.565
I'M--
IT'S OKAY.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.568
(Jeff Buckley's "Lover,
You Should've Come Over" plays)

36:09.568 --> 36:13.872
â™ª LOOKING OUT THE DOOR,
I SEE THE RAIN FALL UPON... â™ª

36:13.872 --> 36:15.874
IT'S ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.876
â™ª ...MOURNERS â™ª

36:21.480 --> 36:25.854
â™ª PARADING IN A WAKE
OF SAD RELATIONS â™ª

36:25.854 --> 36:28.457
â™ª AS THEIR SHOES FILL UP
WITH WATER â™ª

36:28.457 --> 36:31.590
THERE ARE NO WORDS FOR THIS...

36:31.590 --> 36:34.863
NONE THAT MEAN HALF A DAMN
ANYWAY.

36:34.863 --> 36:36.425
â™ªâ™ª

36:36.425 --> 36:39.528
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE ARE GONE,
AND THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK.

36:39.528 --> 36:40.929
â™ª TO KEEP GOOD LOVE â™ª

36:40.929 --> 36:42.931
AND WE'LL MISS THEM.

36:42.931 --> 36:44.433
â™ª FROM GOING WRONG â™ª

36:44.433 --> 36:45.974
â™ª BUT TONIGHT â™ª

36:45.974 --> 36:48.907
BUT THINGS ARE GOING
TO GET BETTER.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.740
THE SUN'S GONNA RISE
ON A NEW DAY.

36:51.740 --> 36:55.914
I KNOW IT DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE IT WILL,

36:55.914 --> 36:58.547
BUT THAT DAWN IS COMING.

36:58.547 --> 36:59.918
THERE'S HOPE.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.821
ONE OF THE AGENTS HERE
REPEATED TO ME

37:02.821 --> 37:05.924
SOMETHING THAT A FRIEND
HAD MENTIONED TO HIM.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.956
AND HE SAID,
"WE'RE ALL PROPHETS NOW."

37:07.956 --> 37:13.231
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T THINK
OF A PROPHET WORTH A DAMN...

37:13.231 --> 37:14.863
THAT DIDN'T SUFFER.

37:14.863 --> 37:17.406
â™ª HOW MUCH I NEED IT â™ª

37:17.406 --> 37:22.441
AND I ALSO CAN'T THINK
OF A PROPHET...

37:22.441 --> 37:23.912
â™ª TOO YOUNG... â™ª

37:23.912 --> 37:26.915
THAT GOD DIDN'T LOVE.

37:26.915 --> 37:32.721
â™ª AND TOO OLD
TO JUST BREAK FREE AND RUN â™ª

37:34.283 --> 37:36.525
â™ª SOMETIMES A MAN â™ª

37:36.525 --> 37:38.427
(whoosh)
GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

37:38.427 --> 37:40.289
â™ª GETS CARRIED AWAY
WHEN HE FEELS LIKE â™ª

37:40.289 --> 37:42.291
THIS LITTLE BOY'S
GONNA COME INTO MY LIFE,

37:42.291 --> 37:44.593
AND I'M GONNA BE HIS MOM.

37:44.593 --> 37:47.596
â™ª AND MUCH TOO BLIND TO SEE â™ª

37:47.596 --> 37:51.300
â™ª THE DAMAGE HE'S DONE â™ª

37:51.300 --> 37:54.973
â™ª AND SOMETIMES A MAN
MUST AWAKE â™ª

37:54.973 --> 37:56.845
â™ª TO FIND THAT REALLY â™ª

37:56.845 --> 38:03.412
â™ª HE HAS NO ONE â™ª

38:03.412 --> 38:07.316
â™ª IT'S NEVER OVER â™ª

38:07.316 --> 38:13.362
â™ª A KINGDOM
FOR A KISS UPON HER SHOULDER â™ª

38:13.362 --> 38:15.894
â™ªâ™ª

38:15.894 --> 38:17.496
ABSENT FRIENDS.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.498
(all) ABSENT FRIENDS.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.970
(glasses clinking)

38:21.970 --> 38:23.972
(Demetri)
HOW MANY OF THESE SPEECHES

38:23.972 --> 38:26.435
DO YOU THINK HAVE BEEN GIVEN
SINCE THE BLACKOUT?

38:26.435 --> 38:29.438
YOU GOTTA FIGURE SOMETHING LIKE
THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY,

38:29.438 --> 38:30.939
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

38:30.939 --> 38:33.011
ALL OVER THE WORLD. HMM.

38:39.918 --> 38:42.451
(mutters)

38:44.022 --> 38:46.024
I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.026
WHAT?
EXCUSE ME. JUST COME ON.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.959
(indistinct conversations)

38:53.562 --> 38:54.733
(chuckles)

38:54.733 --> 38:56.665
I'M A RAINDROP,

38:56.665 --> 38:58.667
AND I'M FALLING FOR YOU.

38:58.667 --> 39:02.010
(laughs) WHAT?
(laughs) THAT'S HOW YOU TRIED
TO PICK ME UP. REMEMBER?

39:02.010 --> 39:04.072
I WOULD NEVER USE THAT LINE.
MM-HMM.

39:04.072 --> 39:06.745
I SAID, UM,
YOU OWED ME A DRINK

39:06.745 --> 39:09.047
FOR, UH, SHREDDING MY ASS
ON THE WITNESS STAND.

39:09.047 --> 39:12.080
I DID SHRED YOUR ASS,
BUT I LEFT ALL THE GOOD PARTS.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.023
(laughs)

39:15.023 --> 39:16.685
YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:16.685 --> 39:19.528
YEAH. YEAH.

39:19.528 --> 39:20.989
YEAH.

39:20.989 --> 39:22.891
LET'S DO IT.
HUH?

39:22.891 --> 39:24.893
THE "D-DAY" WEDDING.
LET'S DO IT.

39:26.395 --> 39:28.397
ARE YOU SURE?
'CAUSE THE OTHER DAY--

39:28.397 --> 39:30.639
THE OTHER DAY
WAS THE OTHER DAY.

39:30.639 --> 39:31.940
I, UM... TODAY...

39:35.073 --> 39:37.976
I WANT US
TO MAKE OUR FUTURE HAPPEN.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.408
YEAH?

39:41.710 --> 39:43.882
(squeals) BABY!
(chuckles)

39:43.882 --> 39:47.816
OKAY, JUST GO WITH ME ON THIS
FOR A SECOND.

39:47.816 --> 39:49.818
(clears throat)
IT SAYS HERE

39:49.818 --> 39:52.120
THAT THE AUDUBON SOCIETY
TRACKS BIRD POPULATION TRENDS.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.123
OKAY, I NEED YOU TO LOOK UP
THE WORLDWIDE CROW POPULATION

39:55.123 --> 39:57.866
FOR, SAY, THE LAST YEAR.

39:57.866 --> 40:00.629
(typing)

40:00.629 --> 40:02.901
(rapid beeps)

40:02.901 --> 40:05.474
THERE. SEE THAT DIP?

40:05.474 --> 40:07.135
THE DAY OF THE BLACKOUT.

40:07.135 --> 40:10.839
GEYER SAID THAT CROWS DIED
OUTSIDE HIS CELL,

40:10.839 --> 40:13.141
BUT IT WASN'T JUST
IN GERMANY.

40:13.141 --> 40:16.414
CROWS DIED ALL OVER THE WORLD
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.786
(exhales deeply) MARK...

40:17.786 --> 40:19.788
AND I SAY THIS WITH LOVE,

40:19.788 --> 40:21.450
WHO GIVES A DAMN?

40:21.450 --> 40:23.892
LOOK AND SEE IF THERE WERE
ANY OTHER INSTANCES

40:23.892 --> 40:26.595
OF CROW POPULATIONS
PLUMMETING LIKE THIS.

40:26.595 --> 40:29.628
(typing)

40:30.929 --> 40:34.663
IN THE GANWAR REGION
OF SOMALIA.

40:34.663 --> 40:37.606
IN 1991, ALL THE CROWS DIED
ON THE SAME DAY.

40:37.606 --> 40:40.138
MARK, WHO CARES?
WHY DID WE SET UP MOSAIC?

40:40.138 --> 40:42.541
TO LOOK FOR PATTERNS.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.543
THANKS TO GEYER, WE NOW KNOW

40:44.543 --> 40:46.615
CROWS DIED ALL OVER THE WORLD
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

40:46.615 --> 40:49.778
SEARCH ON GANWAR
AND THE DATE THOSE CROWS DIED.

40:49.778 --> 40:51.750
(sighs)

40:51.750 --> 40:54.653
(types, beeps)

40:54.653 --> 40:55.954
JUST ONE HIT.

40:55.954 --> 41:00.058
A C.D.C. REQUEST FOR
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM D.H.S.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.631
YOU KNOW, MARK,
THIS IS JUST ANECDOTAL.

41:02.631 --> 41:04.893
LOOK, THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE
ANY CORROBORATION.

41:04.893 --> 41:06.595
NO, NO, NO, NO.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

41:06.595 --> 41:08.997
"C.D.C. DOCTORS
TRAVEL TO THE GANWAR REGION

41:08.997 --> 41:10.769
"IN RESPONSE TO CLAIMS

41:10.769 --> 41:14.743
THAT THE INHABITANTS SUFFERED
A MASS LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS."

41:14.743 --> 41:16.775
(exhales)
JANIS, WE'VE BEEN SO WORRIED

41:16.775 --> 41:18.777
THE BLACKOUT
MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.510
WE HAVEN'T STOPPED
TO ASK OURSELVES,

41:21.510 --> 41:23.512
WHAT IF IT HAPPENED BEFORE?

41:28.557 --> 41:31.560
(goats bleating)

41:42.000 --> 41:46.074
(goats grunting and bleating
rapidly)

41:46.074 --> 41:49.738
(crows cawing loudly)
