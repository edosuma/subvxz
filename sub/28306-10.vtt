00:01.169 --> 00:03.971
ANNOUNCER: In space,
no one can hear you sc--

00:04.004 --> 00:06.107
(all screaming)

00:06.140 --> 00:07.941
ANNOUNCER: Archer 1999.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.811
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FXX.

00:12.546 --> 00:15.849
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:15.883 --> 00:16.884
[bats squeal]

00:18.018 --> 00:21.155
*

00:21.189 --> 00:23.124
GUILLERMO:
I like being a familiar.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.459
It's a very satisfying job.

00:25.493 --> 00:28.729
Well, actually, calling it
a job would imply that it pays.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.765
So it's more of a vocation.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.534
Less glamorous than I imagined.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.804
(retching)

00:36.837 --> 00:38.872
I thought by now
I'd be like Armand,

00:38.906 --> 00:41.041
but sometimes I feel like

00:41.075 --> 00:43.010
I'm halfway
turning into a Renfield.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.545
(insect buzzes)

00:44.578 --> 00:46.214
*

00:46.247 --> 00:48.816
I think the worst part
for me is the loneliness.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.852
I'm awake when
my master's asleep, and...

00:51.885 --> 00:53.687
the house gets quiet

00:53.721 --> 00:55.689
and it's lonely,
but I'm also awake

00:55.723 --> 00:56.924
when he's awake.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.693
I'm always awake.
(sighs)

00:59.727 --> 01:01.829
You know, sometimes I wonder
what my life would be like

01:01.862 --> 01:03.864
if I was still at Panera Bread.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.866
I'd probably be manager.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.536
I'd get to boss other people
around for a change,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.738
sleeping, health insurance,

01:10.771 --> 01:11.972
friends...

01:12.005 --> 01:13.073
(saw whirs)

01:13.107 --> 01:14.608
...getting paid,

01:14.642 --> 01:17.845
all the Panera Bread
you can eat.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.547
But you know what they say:

01:19.580 --> 01:22.616
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.818
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

01:24.852 --> 01:27.288
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

01:27.321 --> 01:29.857
* They have no use
for your song *

01:29.890 --> 01:32.493
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

01:32.526 --> 01:35.396
* You're dead
and out of this world *

01:36.964 --> 01:40.033
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

01:40.067 --> 01:42.770
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

01:42.803 --> 01:45.072
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

01:45.105 --> 01:47.775
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

01:47.808 --> 01:49.410
*

01:58.719 --> 02:00.288
*

02:07.495 --> 02:09.797
-NANDOR (muffled):
Good evening, Guillermo.
-Good evening, Master.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.165
I have an envelope for you.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.767
Okay, pop it in the coffin.
Thank you.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.537
Uh, just... pop it in there.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.406
That's... that's...

02:18.439 --> 02:20.274
Is it in yet?

02:22.009 --> 02:25.646
I can't read it.
It's too dark in here.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.015
Is it another summons
for jury duty?

02:28.048 --> 02:29.950
Just tell them I'm dead.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.452
Oh, no.
It's something very cool.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.986
I had your DNA tested.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.087
A lab tested it.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.627
How did they get the DNA?

02:39.660 --> 02:42.095
Did they steal my semen?

02:42.129 --> 02:44.898
-What? No.
-I won't have my semen
stolen again.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.334
No, I don't, I don't...

02:46.367 --> 02:47.935
No, I don't even know
what that story is.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.737
No, this is all very scientific.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.072
Huh. Okay.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.407
Well, the story is

02:53.441 --> 02:57.144
some witches decided
to steal my semen

02:57.177 --> 03:00.180
and put it into a semen spell.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.517
But it didn't even work, and
then they got semen everywhere.

03:03.551 --> 03:07.888
But this seems
much more aboveboard, so...

03:07.921 --> 03:09.757
This just uses science
to find out

03:09.790 --> 03:11.525
where your ancestors came from.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.395
It could also be used to see if
you have any living relatives.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.697
Living relatives?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.031
* Dun, da-da, da. *

03:18.065 --> 03:19.867
Here's yours.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.202
You have...

03:22.236 --> 03:24.204
Oh, wow.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.206
-What?
-You have...

03:26.240 --> 03:30.844
200,000 direct
living descendants.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.179
That's a lot.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.881
I'm a granddad?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.916
Well, technically, you're a...

03:35.949 --> 03:38.686
great-granddad times 30.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.953
(chuckles)

03:39.987 --> 03:41.522
NANDOR:
Becoming a vampire came

03:41.555 --> 03:43.691
at a strange time in my life.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.759
I was married at the time

03:45.793 --> 03:47.861
to 37 women.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.863
My 37 wives weren't very happy

03:49.897 --> 03:51.732
about the changes
I was going through.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.703
I was becoming very moody,
sleeping all day now.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.572
Nighttime was mainly
drinking people's blood.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.641
Put a strain on all of us.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.209
Then they left,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.477
all 37 of them.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.279
It was a sad night for me,

04:05.313 --> 04:08.081
because I really loved
35 of them.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.683
In those days,

04:09.717 --> 04:12.085
fathers didn't really
look after their children.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.821
It was down to the women.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.690
And in some cases,
a couple of friendly wolves.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.527
-(wolf howling)
-I did try to visit
my children, but...

04:19.560 --> 04:23.163
they were just afraid,
you know, 'cause...

04:23.196 --> 04:26.867
I'm a vampire floating
outside the window.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.402
Hey, kiddies.

04:28.436 --> 04:31.572
Hey, you've got my nose.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.743
That's the last time I saw them.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.246
Probably dead now, I suppose.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.349
And another cool thing is,
you can find out

04:41.382 --> 04:44.051
if any of them live near you.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.454
You have one of them

04:46.487 --> 04:48.121
living right here
in Staten Island.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.723
Madeline.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.526
Exciting.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.195
-Why are we going
to the library?
-This better be good, Nandor.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.064
-How long is this gonna take?
-I was cleaning my skull.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.066
Not long, not long. Thank you.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.869
Everyone, I have
some very exciting news.

05:01.902 --> 05:05.973
Guillermo has had my DNA tested.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.908
You need to be careful
that's not evil witches trying

05:07.941 --> 05:10.444
-to pinch your semen.
-Yes. Witches
are semen stealers.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.480
There's no semen-stealing.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.214
It's very official.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.983
It came in an envelope.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.551
GUILLERMO:
I actually had
everyone's DNA tested.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.319
NADJA:
How did you get our DNA

05:19.353 --> 05:22.623
-without us knowing?
-You literally leave it
laying everywhere,

05:22.656 --> 05:24.625
so it wasn't that hard.
So, here's yours, Nadja.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.395
No, thank you, please. Put that
on the pile there for burning.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.497
-You sure you
don't want to open it?
-Don't test me!

05:29.530 --> 05:31.264
Okay, forget that.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.100
-So, Laszlo...
-Don't you dare.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.468
-You don't want to...?
-Bugger off.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.470
-(hisses)
-That's not very nice.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.871
Okay. Colin Robinson.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.608
-Ding, ding, ding.
-There you go.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.909
Could I get a drumroll first?

05:41.942 --> 05:43.010
-No.
-No.
-Nope.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.812
Fine. I'll do my own.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.147
(imitating drumroll)

05:47.180 --> 05:48.916
Frankly, I would be flattered

05:48.949 --> 05:52.252
if witches collected my semen.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.988
(imitates cymbal striking)

05:55.022 --> 05:56.289
It says here that

05:56.323 --> 05:59.493
I am 100% white.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.195
People are
from all different places.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.831
It just can't say "white"
on your paper.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.332
Oh, wow. "100% white."

06:05.365 --> 06:07.935
COLIN:
No other nuance.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.870
NANDOR:
Tell them my other news,
Guillermo.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.840
Okay. He has over two hundred...

06:12.873 --> 06:16.644
200,000 direct descendants
living today!

06:16.677 --> 06:18.679
Fucking hell.
Well done, chap.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.280
NANDOR:
Thank you, Laszlo.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.250
Congratulations, Nandor.
That is some very exciting seed.

06:23.283 --> 06:26.019
-Yes.
-But I'm telling you, don't let
the witches find out about it.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.354
They'll be coming for you.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.490
-No...
-That is top-quality seed.

06:29.523 --> 06:32.225
And thanks to your little
helper, they know about it.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.127
I'm telling you,
they're coming for more.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.663
They use it to make magnets.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.365
I'm a granddad.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.067
-COLIN: You know...
-NANDOR: Don't ruin it.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.369
Oh, I-I wouldn't
think of ruining it.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.371
-Thank you.
-The great Genghis Khan

06:44.404 --> 06:48.476
-I knew it.
-has over 16 million
living descendants.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.911
Now, that's a seed.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.345
You just have to bring up
Genghis Khan.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.981
Do any of his relatives
live nearby?

06:54.014 --> 06:55.415
Actually, yes.

06:55.449 --> 06:59.252
Uh, he has a great-times-30
granddaughter

06:59.286 --> 07:02.089
who lives here in Staten Island.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.091
So did you get your DNA tested,
Guillermo?

07:04.124 --> 07:06.860
I did, but you probably
wouldn't be interested

07:06.894 --> 07:09.930
-in finding out the results.
-Yes. Probably not.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.534
NANDOR:
Thank you for attending.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.303
GUILLERMO:
I'm mainly mestizo,
which I already knew.

07:16.336 --> 07:19.272
3.12% Dutch.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.475
That's pretty cool.
(chuckles)

07:21.509 --> 07:23.644
This basically shows
my family tree.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.412
There's the Dutch family,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.180
and the name is Van Helsing.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.149
That's...
(chuckles)

07:29.182 --> 07:31.318
that's actually really funny.

07:31.351 --> 07:34.254
Uh, 'cause I don't know
if you're familiar with, uh,

07:34.287 --> 07:35.923
who Van Helsing is...

07:35.956 --> 07:38.058
*

07:38.091 --> 07:39.927
The most notorious
vampire killer.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.730
I have Van Helsing DNA
in my blood,

07:42.763 --> 07:45.398
which is...

07:45.432 --> 07:47.901
But he's not real, so...

07:47.935 --> 07:49.670
He's not real.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.640
Is he?

07:52.673 --> 07:53.774
I mean, vampires are real,

07:53.807 --> 07:56.143
but...

07:56.176 --> 07:58.979
I suppose there could be
a vampire...

08:00.213 --> 08:01.414
Oh, wow.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.415
I love vampires.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.752
I-I...

08:04.785 --> 08:07.154
I killed two accidentally.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.023
-Stay back!
-(grunts)

08:10.057 --> 08:11.058
(gasps)

08:11.091 --> 08:12.993
Oh, fuck.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.261
My tummy feels weird.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.963
Just...

08:15.996 --> 08:18.465
I th... What'd I have for lunch?
I had for lunch...

08:18.498 --> 08:20.300
I had, um...

08:20.333 --> 08:22.369
(whispers):
garlic.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.979
LASZLO:
When I was a human man,

08:32.012 --> 08:34.481
I had rosy cheeks,
yet in between those cheeks,

08:34.514 --> 08:36.817
there was never a smile.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.587
And then, one night,
everything changed.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.022
Nadja came through the window

08:42.055 --> 08:43.657
and took my life.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.893
She opened a window to my soul

08:45.926 --> 08:48.829
and let the darkness in.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.364
I'm creating something
very special for her.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.800
It's yet to take shape.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.935
When it does, I think
she'll be very impressed.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.805
I can't be bothered to hold this
anymore. Can you tether it?

08:57.838 --> 09:00.140
-Uh, actually...
-What the fuck
have you got in your hand?!

09:00.173 --> 09:01.474
Put that down!

09:01.508 --> 09:03.276
That's a wooden stake,
you dickhead!

09:03.310 --> 09:05.078
Well, you asked me to buy
garden stakes, so I b...

09:05.112 --> 09:07.014
Get them out of my sight now,
you smart-ass.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.481
-Okay.
-Where did you get them from?

09:08.515 --> 09:10.217
-Amazon, so...
-Well, then you get in your car,

09:10.250 --> 09:11.518
and you drive back
to the Amazon.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.786
That's not how that w...
It's online.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.322
Shut your mouth,
and tie this thing up.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.190
Fucking halfwit.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.661
Stakes! The most offensive thing
he could bring into the house.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.895
Tighter!

09:21.929 --> 09:24.998
So, Nandor has
200,000 descendants.

09:25.032 --> 09:29.069
Still far fewer than,
uh, Genghis Khan.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.538
Um, so we're gonna go visit one.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.406
NANDOR:
Her name is Madeline.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.109
I'm going to float up
to her window and see her.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.546
Not going
to introduce myself yet.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.248
Don't want to frighten her.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.952
I need you to be very supportive
of me at this delicate moment.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.854
Going to give her some gifts.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.056
Got her a little teddy bear.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.557
Ugh. You know what?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.559
This isn't working,
me being supportive.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.562
I feel like
I am literally eating myself.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.563
Ugh!

09:56.596 --> 09:58.598
It is time.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.634
*

10:08.475 --> 10:09.943
Don't tap on the window.

10:09.977 --> 10:13.346
I see her. She's asleep.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.882
How does she look, Master?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.918
She looks a little older
than I was anticipating.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.553
That-That's what I was trying
to tell you-- she's 94.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.223
-So young! (gasps)
-COLIN: Don't tap on the window.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.893
She is stirring.
I'm going to tap on the window.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.929
-No.
-N-No, Master,
don't tap on the window.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.798
Madeline!

10:30.831 --> 10:32.700
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap!

10:32.733 --> 10:34.434
-Oh, crap.
-Wakey, wakey!

10:34.467 --> 10:36.236
Ah.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.637
She's awake.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.472
Come to me, my little one.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.709
Come, look, this is for you.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.844
Your grandpappy is here.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.378
Say hello.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.747
-This is...
-(Madeline gasps)

10:46.780 --> 10:47.748
(body thuds)

10:47.781 --> 10:49.482
Oh, no.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.186
I knew I shouldn't have tapped
on her window,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.255
but you goaded me.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.025
If, by "goading,"
you mean my saying,

10:58.058 --> 11:00.928
"Under no circumstances
should you tap on her window,"

11:00.961 --> 11:02.662
then, yes, I goaded you.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.231
Yes, exactly. You see,

11:04.264 --> 11:06.666
you are a goader,
Guillermo is a goader.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.770
You saw an opportunity to goad
and what did you do?

11:09.803 --> 11:12.172
-You goaded it.
-Okay.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.941
NANDOR:
Guillermo!

11:13.974 --> 11:15.943
What is this feeling

11:15.976 --> 11:17.610
I am feeling?

11:17.644 --> 11:19.446
It's grief, Master!

11:19.479 --> 11:21.514
Grief?

11:21.548 --> 11:23.550
-(siren wailing)
-I don't care for it.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.519
Wait, wait. Nandor!

11:26.553 --> 11:28.756
How am I supposed
to get down, Nandor?

11:28.789 --> 11:32.125
You goaded me, and now
you got to take the stairs!

11:32.159 --> 11:34.294
This is why you don't
get attached to humans.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.463
They don't last long.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.365
It is like with my sweet Gregor.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.001
He is reborn and then he dies.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.671
And again and again and again.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.540
And every time he comes back,
our love is reignited

11:47.574 --> 11:49.542
like a big ball of flames,

11:49.576 --> 11:52.479
-and then
he is brutally decapitated.
-(yelling)

11:52.512 --> 11:54.647
Look at this one.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.817
Such a beautiful head of hair.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.385
I like it when he's subservient,

11:58.418 --> 11:59.686
but not like this.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.823
Hello!
Num, num, num, num, num.

12:02.856 --> 12:06.860
* Gregor,
you are the sweetest boy *

12:06.894 --> 12:08.628
* Kid. *

12:08.661 --> 12:11.531
(whispering): I have to be very
careful in case Laszlo sees.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.535
* My sweet Gregor *

12:15.568 --> 12:17.971
* Gregor, can you hear me? *

12:18.005 --> 12:19.773
* Gregor, hear me *

12:19.807 --> 12:22.309
* Singing this song *

12:22.342 --> 12:25.445
* Gregor, can you hear me? *

12:25.478 --> 12:27.580
-* Gregor, hear me *
-Nadja.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.217
-Nadja! Nadja!
-* Singing this song... *

12:30.250 --> 12:33.954
(yelling)

12:35.923 --> 12:37.724
-(grunts)
-(bones snap)

12:37.757 --> 12:39.793
I'm Gregor!

12:39.827 --> 12:41.594
(grunts)

12:41.628 --> 12:42.729
(keys jingle)

12:42.762 --> 12:45.532
Nadja!

12:45.565 --> 12:47.500
-(grunting)
-(glass breaking)

12:47.534 --> 12:48.635
Nadja?

12:49.903 --> 12:51.905
Nadja!

12:57.110 --> 12:58.678
(car alarm chirps)

13:01.248 --> 13:04.251
Hey! Hey!
Goddamn it. Call the cops.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.558
NADJA:
Nandor has invited us
to join him at the funeral

13:11.591 --> 13:13.927
of his descendant Madeline.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.795
-NADJA: Wait. It's in a church?
-LASZLO: Oh, bloody hell.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.630
-Well, of course.
It's a funeral.
-But hang on.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.867
It's night. Shouldn't there be
no one in there?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.568
I got it changed
to later in the evening.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.003
-Asshole.
-How did you do that?

13:23.036 --> 13:25.205
I... called in a bomb scare.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.473
-I can't go in there.
-No.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.575
Do it for Madeline.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.077
Look at the pictures
on the glass.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.279
It's the Jeebus man.
(groans)

13:32.312 --> 13:34.447
Thought of going
in a church-- a church--

13:34.481 --> 13:36.283
makes me nervous
to say the word.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.485
I just...
(guttural gagging)

13:38.518 --> 13:40.420
You know, this...
Not much scares me,

13:40.453 --> 13:41.788
but this...
(guttural gagging)

13:41.821 --> 13:43.356
She can go in.
Why can't we? Look at...

13:43.390 --> 13:44.992
-Because she's not a vampire!
-Look at her.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.793
I'm a vampire.
I can go in.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.497
Energy vampires have no problems
going into places of worship.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.365
We find it to be
fertile feeding ground.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.001
-No! Ooh!
-NADJA: Wonderful, Colin.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.435
Can you go in
and pay our respects,

13:55.468 --> 13:56.870
and we'll just stand here?

13:56.904 --> 13:58.371
This is not
about feeding ground.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.407
This is about
my great-great-great-great-

14:00.440 --> 14:02.876
great-great-
great-great-great-great-

14:02.910 --> 14:06.379
great-great-granddaughter.
Please.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.248
-(Nadja scoffs)
-Please?

14:08.281 --> 14:10.984
-(muttering)
-Fuck it. Fine.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.486
-Madeline.
-Again, it's okay
for me to go in.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.955
I-I'm... I'm gonna be fine.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.489
-NANDOR: Madeline.
-NADJA: Laszlo.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.459
-(organ playing somber music)
-PRIEST: And it is with
great sadness

14:19.492 --> 14:21.394
and tremendous remorse

14:21.428 --> 14:23.796
that we say goodbye
to Madeline Darvish.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.999
She did not have children
of her own,

14:26.033 --> 14:28.801
but many considered her
a mother figure.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.037
-Please rise.
-NADJA: Motherfucking rise.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.871
-Then you rise.
-You rise.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.706
-I really appreciate you coming.
-PRIEST: The Lord
is my shepherd.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.243
-I shall not want...
-Nandor, we got
to get out of here.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.811
Nandor, I'm so sorry. I don't
know how much longer I can last.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.914
-(group grunting)
-(banging on pew)

14:40.948 --> 14:44.817
Nandor, my mascara is running
because of the blood.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.319
You look great.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.720
-(groans)
-I got to get out.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.156
-(grunting)
-I can't do this.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.891
It is a lovely service,
but I'm on fire.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.994
PRIEST:
Your rod and your staff...

14:54.027 --> 14:55.595
-they comfort me.
-Thank you for coming, Nadja.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.998
Hey, I'm gonna go, too.
I'd rather watch TV.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.667
Thank you, Colin Robinson.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.735
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.504
-(gasps)
-Please be seated.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.738
(panting)

15:05.772 --> 15:07.007
Guillermo.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.176
Guillermo, I'm on fire.
Get some water.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.343
Water.
(groans)

15:10.377 --> 15:12.212
Aah!

15:12.245 --> 15:14.214
(congregation murmuring)

15:14.247 --> 15:16.816
So sad. I...

15:16.849 --> 15:19.419
really miss her.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.354
That was holy water, Guillermo.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.124
Are you trying to kill me?

15:24.157 --> 15:25.558
She died too young.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.926
PRIEST:
If anyone

15:26.960 --> 15:28.528
from the family would like

15:28.561 --> 15:30.597
to say a few words,

15:30.630 --> 15:33.333
-(hissing)
-n-now would be a good time.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.804
LASZLO:
Good night, my darling.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.506
Good night, my darling.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.112
MAN (over radio):
West on Jefferson Avenue,

15:45.145 --> 15:47.047
got a late model
red station wagon.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.582
10-96. Escaped mental patient.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.452
-So, my boy Sean...
-Ca-caw!

15:52.485 --> 15:54.654
came to the corner store
down on Eastern Parkway

15:54.687 --> 15:57.024
to get some Twizzlers,
but they only had a family size.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.326
-Yo, shut up, shut up, look.
-What, man? I'm telling a...

15:59.359 --> 16:01.061
-Yo! Whoa!
-TEEN 2: What the fu...?
Dude, what?

16:01.094 --> 16:02.895
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.331
TEEN 1:
Whoa!

16:04.364 --> 16:06.133
-TEEN 2: Dude, holy... Yo...
-(Jeff yelling)

16:06.166 --> 16:08.801
-TEEN 1: Holy shit! Oh, my God.
-TEEN 2: Oh! Look at that!

16:08.835 --> 16:10.970
-TEEN 1: Look at that.
-TEEN 2: Holy shit.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.405
Nadja!

16:12.439 --> 16:13.640
-TEEN 1: Are you okay?
-TEEN 2: Holy shit.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.708
Cheeze-It, yo, yo, yo.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.144
-TEEN 1: Hey, hey, hey.
-TEEN 2: Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.878
-TEEN 1: Oh!
-TEEN 2: Oh, my God.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.381
Nadja!

16:21.414 --> 16:23.016
TEEN 1: That's not-that's not
yours. Hey!
-TEEN 2: Dude!

16:23.050 --> 16:25.152
TEEN 1:
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.920
-(teens shouting indistinctly)
-(siren wails)

16:27.954 --> 16:29.456
-TEEN 1: Yo, yo, yo, yo.
-TEEN 2: Stop!

16:29.489 --> 16:30.990
JEFF (in distance): Nadja?!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.994
Nadja!

16:36.463 --> 16:38.098
Nadja!

16:38.131 --> 16:39.432
Shit.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.702
JEFF:
Nadja!

16:42.735 --> 16:44.171
-Jesk?
-Nadja.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.972
-Oh...
-My Nadja. I heard your call.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.608
-Shh.
-My destiny has brought me here,

16:48.641 --> 16:51.111
-and it is to be with you.
-Oh.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.613
Jesk, uh,
you-you shouldn't be here.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.014
-My husband lives here.
-Husband?

16:55.048 --> 16:57.217
And he is very big, wide man,

16:57.250 --> 16:58.985
-and he loves to bite.
-I don't give a shit.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.853
-He loves to bite...
-Our destiny cannot be denied.

17:00.887 --> 17:04.357
-Who's this, my darling?
-Well... Oh...

17:04.391 --> 17:06.193
A gentleman caller?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.395
Uh, no. This is just my friend
from the park.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.996
We're having a quick catch-up.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.265
I am here for Nadja.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.968
Nadja... is my wife.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.471
I should cut your head off.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.573
Oh, L-Laszlo,
you don't need to do that.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.376
I always have.
(chuckles)

17:23.410 --> 17:24.377
-Wait, what?
-What?

17:24.411 --> 17:25.378
I know who you are.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.714
Outward appearance
may have changed.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.382
The pattern remains the same.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.784
You get reborn,
you try and find her,

17:31.818 --> 17:34.221
and I cut your head off.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.156
(Nadja gasps)

17:36.189 --> 17:38.558
-(flesh squishes)
-(man screams)

17:38.591 --> 17:40.593
-Oh, shit.
-(chuckling)

17:42.829 --> 17:44.497
When I was a street thief?

17:44.531 --> 17:46.199
I had the cleaver in my hand.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.000
-(man screams)
-(flesh squishes)

17:48.034 --> 17:49.402
When I was a naval officer?

17:49.436 --> 17:50.937
I was on board that ship
with a cutlass.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.539
-(man screams, knife scrapes)
-JEFF: When I was atop

17:52.572 --> 17:53.873
-that horse
in the battlefield in...
-Yeah, yeah.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.542
-That was me.
-(horse neighing)

17:55.575 --> 17:56.576
The Amazon explorer?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.345
Guess who tipped off
the natives.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.247
-When I was a mouse?
-I was a cat.
-(cat growls)

18:00.280 --> 18:01.914
When he was a washer woman?

18:01.948 --> 18:04.384
-We can do this all night.
-Really?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.453
-You're an evil genius.
-My darling,

18:06.486 --> 18:09.489
every time doughboy turns up,
you start crying.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.891
Now, I'm not having that.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.927
You're my sweet baby, and I'm
here to stop that kind of jive.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.597
Aw. Crazy knight in...

18:17.630 --> 18:20.032
shining black coat.
(chuckles)

18:20.066 --> 18:21.401
Oh, Laszlo.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.436
JEFF:
Well, this is fucked up.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.904
-Should we get on with it?
-No. No.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.874
Let him have at least
one full life, my darling.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.176
Is this what you want?

18:29.209 --> 18:31.110
Why... y-yes.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.746
I suggest you fuck off

18:33.780 --> 18:36.082
and never darken
our doorstep again.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.852
My wife has everything she needs
with me. Is that understood?

18:39.886 --> 18:42.689
-Goodbye.
-(chuckles)

18:42.722 --> 18:44.224
May-Maybe I'll see you
in the next life.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.058
-Yeah, maybe you won't.
-Oh, okay. All right.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.427
All right, all right.
I'm going.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.896
-May-Maybe you will.
-Mm-hmm.

18:49.929 --> 18:54.100
Now, my darling.
I've created something for you.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.935
Here's your surprise.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.905
(gasps, chuckles)
It's me.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.907
-It is the most beautiful thing
-That's it.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.310
-my eyes has ever witnessed.
-I'm out of here.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.911
Farewell, my love...
(grunts)

19:04.944 --> 19:06.246
-LASZLO: Ooh!
-(Nadja gasps)

19:06.279 --> 19:08.481
-Bloody not.
-Laszlo, what the

19:08.515 --> 19:10.683
-fucking hell have you done?!
-No, no, no, no, my darling.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.252
I swear,
that had nothing to do with me.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.653
NADJA:
Aw. Ew.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.723
I'll leave you some time
alone with...

19:16.756 --> 19:18.157
whatever his name is.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.428
Oh, Gregor,

19:21.461 --> 19:24.631
thank you for all the lovely
times, and I'll see you soon.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.408
NANDOR:
Guillermo?

19:35.442 --> 19:37.577
-Yes, Master?
-You all right?

19:37.610 --> 19:39.111
I'm just tired, Master.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.747
You sure?

19:40.780 --> 19:43.550
Yes, I'm sure.
Time for bed.

19:43.583 --> 19:47.153
What was the results
of your ancestry test?

19:47.186 --> 19:50.357
* Gliding side by side... *

19:50.390 --> 19:53.960
Just...
stereotypical... Mexican.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.529
-Piñata farmers.
-Piñata farmers. Mm-hmm.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.531
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.533
People love piñatas.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.636
Someone's got to breed
those colorful donkeys.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.605
Thank you, Master.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.608
* Underneath the moon... *

20:08.641 --> 20:12.178
Thank you for helping me tonight
on my saddest night.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.114
Even though you did throw
holy water onto me!

20:15.147 --> 20:18.285
Do you remember that?!
It really burned!

20:18.318 --> 20:20.152
-Sorry.
-Why would you do that?!

20:20.186 --> 20:22.188
Outrageous!

20:22.221 --> 20:24.156
Aah, my burns!

20:24.190 --> 20:27.193
From the holy water
that you threw on me.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.629
That is one demerit point
for you,

20:29.662 --> 20:32.465
and one more year
as my familiar.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.166
Good night.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.503
* Underneath
the silvery moon... *

20:36.536 --> 20:38.905
-Guillermo?
-Hmm?

20:38.938 --> 20:41.341
You're having a serious thought?

20:41.374 --> 20:42.909
No.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.712
Oh, yeah, you probably weren't.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.380
Good night.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.116
Good night, Master.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.022
* Underneath the moon
with shadows creeping *

20:56.055 --> 20:57.690
* Underneath the silvery moon *

20:57.724 --> 21:01.894
* Making love while
all the world is sleeping *

21:01.928 --> 21:04.230
* Making love
while the world sleeps *

21:04.263 --> 21:07.133
-* Come along, my dear *
-* Come along, my dear *

21:07.166 --> 21:10.503
-* I am waiting here *
-* I am waiting here *

21:10.537 --> 21:13.673
* Waiting underneath *

21:13.706 --> 21:16.242

21:37.830 --> 21:39.799
* Used to love the street,
euphoria's gone *

21:39.832 --> 21:42.201
* Crack dealer,
sorcerer's stone *

21:42.234 --> 21:43.903
* See, my son,
he was born as a clone *

21:43.936 --> 21:45.738
* Take a seat at the throne *

21:45.772 --> 21:47.740
* Elvis left the building,
eagle has flown *

21:47.774 --> 21:49.909
* I've been mindin' my own,
so just leave me alone *

21:49.942 --> 21:52.512
* This is the season of gods,
I'm-a even the odds *

21:52.545 --> 21:54.781
* You can read between the lines
'cause I'm speakin' in psalms *

21:54.814 --> 21:58.284
* Oh, oh, take a shot
of that holy water *

21:58.317 --> 22:00.820
* Ha, have a talk
with the Holy Father *

22:00.853 --> 22:02.589
* I know that you hear me,
I hope you forgive me *

22:02.622 --> 22:04.290
* 'Cause tonight
I'm pressin' hard *

22:04.323 --> 22:05.725

that you give me *

-(agreeing)

22:24.977 --> 22:26.546
(shouting)

22:26.646 --> 22:29.782
We're stuck inside
a space nautilus, between
his colon and his cloaca.

22:29.816 --> 22:30.850
What's a cloaca?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.819
It's an organ
that's used for excretion

22:32.852 --> 22:34.320
and also intercourse.

WOMAN:
It's a place I go.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.569
It looks like a hallway

23:23.269 --> 23:24.671
with all these doors.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.707
It moves
in two directions.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.442
One way...
(echoes)

23:29.542 --> 23:30.977
