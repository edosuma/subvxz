00:01.160 --> 00:03.003
<i>(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)</i>

00:54.020 --> 00:56.281
it is no surprise to me

00:56.360 --> 00:58.681
that these Northmen
have arrived in Wessex.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.683
After I heard about their
raids into Northumbria,

01:00.800 --> 01:02.723
I realized it was only
a matter of time

01:02.800 --> 01:04.802
before they came ashore here.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.731
When I lived at the court
of the Emperor Charlemagne,

01:11.840 --> 01:14.571
of long and blessed memory,

01:16.040 --> 01:18.930
these Northmen had already
emerged from their lairs

01:19.000 --> 01:20.411
to attack parts of his empire.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.927
And I remember an incident
from this period very well.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.287
I was with Charlemagne's party

01:26.560 --> 01:29.211
at a harbor town
in southern Gaul.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.760
As we sat eating supper,

01:31.840 --> 01:34.491
a fleet of pirates
attacked the harbor.

01:34.880 --> 01:38.089
There was some confusion
about their identity,

01:38.200 --> 01:41.329
but from the build of their ships
and their speed through the water,

01:41.400 --> 01:44.847
the Emperor recognized them
at once as Northmen.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.802
<i>After a lightning attack...</i>

01:49.600 --> 01:50.886
(EXHALES)

01:53.000 --> 01:54.525
They made their escape.

01:54.600 --> 02:00.209
The Emperor's men took up the chase,
but they were soon out-sailed.

02:01.040 --> 02:05.682
Charlemagne rose from the table and
stood at the window, facing east.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.889
I remember it as clearly
as if it were yesterday.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.688
For a long time, he stood

02:15.800 --> 02:18.406
<i>while the tears
poured down his face.</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:24.762
In the end, he said, "Do you
know why I weep so bitterly?

02:25.080 --> 02:29.005
"It's not because I'm afraid these
ruffians will do me any harm.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.686
"I am sick at heart

02:31.760 --> 02:33.683
"to think that
even in my lifetime,

02:33.760 --> 02:36.366
"they have dared
to attack this coast.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.523
"And I am horror-stricken when I
foresee what evil they will do

02:41.720 --> 02:44.246
<i>"to my descendants
and their subjects."</i>

02:46.760 --> 02:51.049
And now, it is our turn
to deal with these ruffians.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.530
These pagans.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.682

03:00.840 --> 03:02.171

03:08.120 --> 03:09.281
Yes, Father.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.807
I put it in your hands to work with
our ealdormen to raise an army.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.526
In the meantime,
we shall send spies and others

03:15.600 --> 03:19.366
to observe the size of the raiding
party and their intentions.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.566
These Northmen never like to
venture far from their ships,

03:22.680 --> 03:25.968
and they prefer not to be
drawn into pitched battle.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.762
Let us not be afraid,
but rather watchful.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.208
And ultimately, decisive.

23:03.560 --> 23:07.087
Did I want to discover where
the pagans would strike?

23:07.760 --> 23:08.886
Yes.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.043
For now I know
where they are.

23:12.320 --> 23:17.087
So Bishop Swithern was
a necessary sacrifice.

23:19.160 --> 23:23.006
As a man of God, I assumed he welcomed
the opportunity for martyrdom.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.648
Or do you disagree?
Oh, no, Sire.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.565
All of the cloth would welcome
martyrdom in the cause of our faith,

23:32.680 --> 23:34.762

lord Jesus Christ.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.681
Good.

precisely that same opportunity,

Even in the darkest moments.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.007
Now, he's making
the gods laugh.

24:33.240 --> 24:37.404
That's why they took him from
us, 'cause they were jealous.

Don't you want it?

25:01.560 --> 25:04.245
Are these not
the images of your god?

25:05.760 --> 25:08.604
I told you before,
and I will tell you again.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.522
My god is Odin,

25:20.920 --> 25:22.604
Ragnar gave me this.

doesn't make you a dog.

This land is rich.

I am a farmer and
the son of a farmer,

26:21.200 --> 26:23.487

I understand.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.927
Compared to our poor countries
where it is hard to farm,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.207
here, it is easy.

If we lived here, we could feed everybody.
There would be no hunger.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.411

but here is my question.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.164
Will the Saxons simply invite
us to live among them?

because my own brother
poisoned the drinks that day.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.046
They have gone raiding west

to myself, but to all of you.
