WEBVTT

00:04.333 --> 00:06.583
(Ivanova)
Commander's personal log.

00:06.667 --> 00:08.333
We're still searching
for First Ones

00:08.417 --> 00:11.292
to use in our war with
the Vorlons and the Shadows.

00:11.375 --> 00:12.875
There's less than 24 hours left

00:12.958 --> 00:15.375
before everything
hits the fan.

00:15.458 --> 00:17.667
We can't afford to waste
any more time.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.375
We have to get back
to Babylon 5

00:19.458 --> 00:21.625
then catch up with the fleet.

00:21.708 --> 00:24.542
We've been waiting for two
hours. We have to move on.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.208
'There aren't any more
First Ones around here.'

00:28.292 --> 00:30.500
We've got five so far.
That's as good enough.

00:30.583 --> 00:34.958
There is time for one more.
This is the last.

00:35.042 --> 00:37.958
It's important
to have them all.

00:38.042 --> 00:39.667
Keep sending the signal.

00:41.292 --> 00:44.333
I'll give you ten more minutes,
and then we're leaving.

00:44.417 --> 00:48.042
I just wish I knew how things
were going out there.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.042
Captain's idea about hitting
Vorlon targets

00:50.125 --> 00:52.667
delaying them long enough to put
our fleets in the killing zone

00:52.750 --> 00:54.458
between the Vorlons
and the Shadows, it's..

00:54.542 --> 00:57.292
A brilliant strategy.

00:57.375 --> 00:58.625
He's making a crucible

00:58.708 --> 01:01.583
which he hopes will force out
the truth.

01:01.667 --> 01:07.625
Quite brave. Possibly futile,
but...very human.

01:07.708 --> 01:09.375
[beeping]

01:10.708 --> 01:13.750
[dramatic music]

01:25.417 --> 01:28.083
I will introduce them
to you now.

01:28.167 --> 01:30.542
They're almost as old
as the Vorlons.

01:30.625 --> 01:33.667
They've not spoken to anyone
outside their own race

01:33.750 --> 01:35.417
for centuries.

01:37.042 --> 01:39.125
But they'll remember you?

01:39.208 --> 01:40.875
Oh, yes.

01:43.458 --> 01:45.583
I just hope the captain's okay.

01:46.375 --> 01:49.417
[music continues]

01:51.500 --> 01:54.375
White Star 9, break off
and target their forward guns.

01:55.208 --> 01:58.250
[music continues]

02:01.750 --> 02:03.375
Forward screens are down.

02:03.458 --> 02:05.792
Tactical Squadron,
follow us in.

02:07.958 --> 02:11.000
[zapping]

02:17.375 --> 02:19.750
Vorlon observation post
destroyed.

02:19.833 --> 02:22.042
Good. We can proceed
to the rendezvous point

02:22.125 --> 02:23.375
without being watched.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.500
Make the jump to hyperspace,
Mr. Lennier.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.125
Look at it.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.333
Thousands of ships.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.583
Over two dozen races
working together

02:50.667 --> 02:52.750
for the very first time.

02:52.833 --> 02:55.125
You put together
a hell of a team, Delenn.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.250
You should be proud.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.417
Win or lose,
we'll go down fighting.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.458
Pour it on, Mr. Lennier.

03:03.542 --> 03:04.958
Take us into the fire.

03:06.583 --> 03:09.625
[intense music]

03:16.875 --> 03:18.750
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.750
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.583
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.583
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.917
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.500
(Marcus)
The year of pain..

03:29.583 --> 03:31.125
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.958
(Londo)
It was a new age.

03:33.042 --> 03:34.833
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

03:34.917 --> 03:37.708
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

03:40.208 --> 03:44.125
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261. The place..

03:44.208 --> 03:46.375
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

03:46.458 --> 03:49.500
[theme music]

04:19.458 --> 04:22.542
[music continues]

04:42.750 --> 04:44.542
[dramatic music]

04:46.667 --> 04:48.083
I've heard that
some of the Vorlons

04:48.167 --> 04:49.458
would be within
striking distance

04:49.542 --> 04:51.083
of Centauri Prime
about the same time

04:51.167 --> 04:53.750
we reach Coriana VI..

04:53.833 --> 04:56.625
...so why are we here
instead of there?

04:57.792 --> 05:00.208
Six billion lives on Coriana.

05:00.292 --> 05:03.208
Three billion lives
on Centauri Prime.

05:03.292 --> 05:05.250
We have enough ships
to make a stand at one of them

05:05.333 --> 05:07.375
so which do you choose?

05:07.458 --> 05:08.875
It's numbers..

05:08.958 --> 05:11.500
Cold, unsympathetic numbers.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.083
Let's just hope we pulled
enough of the Vorlons away

05:15.167 --> 05:17.042
to give the Centauri a chance
or if they've

05:17.125 --> 05:20.875
got rid of any
Shadow influences by now.

05:20.958 --> 05:25.042
Otherwise, I wouldn't give you
two cents for their chances.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.875
Ambassador. I mean-I mean..

05:32.958 --> 05:35.917
I-I mean..
Prime Minister Mollari

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
but we tried to get everything
you wanted in place

05:38.083 --> 05:40.000
but you've given us
so little time

05:40.083 --> 05:41.958
and with the death
of Emperor Cartagia

05:42.042 --> 05:44.292
we have all been in mourning.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.042
(Londo)
'Well, you'll be mourning
the entire planet'

05:46.125 --> 05:47.875
unless we take care
of this quickly.

05:47.958 --> 05:50.250
The Vorlons are less
than 12 hours away.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.750
We have to get rid
of the Shadow Vessels

05:51.833 --> 05:53.167
before they get here.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.917
Bring me the ministers of war,
intelligence

05:56.000 --> 05:57.542
transportation, and security.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.000
I want them here
in ten minutes.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.208
Prime minister,
please--

06:01.292 --> 06:02.917
And then you will clear
the palace

06:03.000 --> 06:05.083
of everyone who has
worked for Cartagia.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.750
Personal guards,
food tasters

06:07.833 --> 06:09.625
physicians, everyone.

06:09.708 --> 06:11.292
I have enough
to deal with as it is

06:11.375 --> 06:13.542
without worrying about
a knife in the back.

06:13.625 --> 06:15.208
Minister, please!

06:15.292 --> 06:17.583
Oh, oh, oh. Sorry.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.208
I wasn't thinking.

06:19.292 --> 06:21.292
Felt very natural though.

06:21.375 --> 06:24.500
Why is he..
Why are you still here?

06:24.583 --> 06:26.917
- Go, go!
- Go, go.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.042
We have very little time left,
Vir

06:32.125 --> 06:34.708
and much work ahead of us,
and then..

06:34.792 --> 06:38.125
...then we must find Mr. Morden

06:38.208 --> 06:40.833
and tell him the bad news.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.708
John, I've just
heard from Ivanova.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.333
They have found all of
the remaining First Ones

06:50.417 --> 06:52.333
and sent them on
to the rendezvous point.

06:52.417 --> 06:54.875
She was about to follow,
but, uh..

06:54.958 --> 06:57.167
...I told her to wait
for confirmation.

06:59.292 --> 07:01.375
John, we have so many ships.

07:01.458 --> 07:04.167
One more will not
turn the tide of battle.

07:04.250 --> 07:08.500
I promised Ivanova she'd be here
with the fleet at the end.

07:08.583 --> 07:10.667
I owe it to her
to keep that promise.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.500
Tell her to come on in
and to haul ass

07:12.583 --> 07:14.708
or she'll miss
all the excitement.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.292
Very well.

07:16.375 --> 07:19.333
I'll tell her to haul ass

07:19.417 --> 07:21.958
but that seems to me
a very undignified position

07:22.042 --> 07:24.667
from which to command
one of the White Star fleet.

07:29.792 --> 07:31.208
[doorbell beeps]

07:31.292 --> 07:32.750
Yes?

07:37.833 --> 07:40.167
I was told you were
ready to leave.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.042
Almost. You're awfully impatient

07:42.125 --> 07:43.917
for someone who's supposed
to be immortal.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.750
Not immortal as you mean it.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.958
My race can die..

07:49.042 --> 07:50.958
...through illness or injury.

07:51.042 --> 07:53.708
So where are the rest of them?

07:53.792 --> 07:57.792
They, uh, fell ill and died,
were injured and died.

07:57.875 --> 08:04.083
The rest went away. I am
the last, and I was the first.

08:04.167 --> 08:07.167
I have to admit I'm a little bit
skeptical about that.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.708
Skepticism is the language
of the mind.

08:10.792 --> 08:14.625
What does your heart tell you?

08:14.708 --> 08:16.875
My heart
and I don't speak anymore.

08:16.958 --> 08:18.042
Yes.

08:19.042 --> 08:20.833
I have noticed that.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.125
Okay.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.083
Let's assume that
in all of the universe

08:31.167 --> 08:34.000
you were the first living being
to achieve sentience

08:34.083 --> 08:35.958
billions of years ago.

08:36.042 --> 08:38.583
At that point,
you'd be doing pretty good

08:38.667 --> 08:41.000
to invent fire or the wheel.

08:41.083 --> 08:43.625
You couldn't come up
with science, technology

08:43.708 --> 08:46.500
find a serum for immortality,
all in one lifetime.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.500
It wasn't necessary.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.417
We were born
naturally immortal.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.083
It's impossible.
Everything dies.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.458
Yes...now.

08:57.542 --> 09:00.750
At first, we were kept in
balance by birth rate.

09:00.833 --> 09:05.333
Few of us were ever born,
less than a handful each year.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.542
Then, I think
the universe decided

09:07.625 --> 09:09.917
that to appreciate life

09:10.000 --> 09:12.042
for there to be
change and growth

09:12.125 --> 09:14.667
life had to be short

09:14.750 --> 09:17.375
so the generations
that followed us

09:17.458 --> 09:21.333
grew old, infirm, died.

09:21.417 --> 09:24.792
But those of us
who were first went on.

09:24.875 --> 09:27.292
We discovered the Vorlons
and the Shadows

09:27.375 --> 09:30.833
when they were infant races,
and nourished them

09:30.917 --> 09:35.583
helped them and all the other
races you call the First Ones.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.833
In time, most of them died

09:38.917 --> 09:42.750
or passed beyond the rim
to whatever lies

09:42.833 --> 09:45.542
in the darkness
between galaxies.

09:45.625 --> 09:48.583
We've lived too long,
seen too much.

09:49.708 --> 09:51.583
To live on as we have

09:51.667 --> 09:57.125
is to leave behind joy
and love and companionship

09:57.208 --> 10:00.792
because we know it to be
transitory of the moment.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.208
We know it will turn to ash.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.375
Only those
whose lives are brief

10:08.458 --> 10:10.250
can imagine that love..

10:11.625 --> 10:13.125
...is eternal.

10:17.458 --> 10:22.000
You should embrace
that remarkable illusion.

10:22.083 --> 10:27.250
It may be the greatest gift
your race has ever received.

10:41.417 --> 10:43.792
Prime minister, I'd like to
speak with you, if I could.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.542
Well, I'm in rather a hurry.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.292
If there is something
you need to discuss

10:47.375 --> 10:49.250
you should've done so
during the meeting, yes?

10:49.333 --> 10:51.542
I think you will agree
that this is a personal

10:51.625 --> 10:53.625
and, uh, private matter.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.417
Alright, Durano.

11:00.792 --> 11:03.875
What does the Ministry of
Intelligence want with me, hmm?

11:03.958 --> 11:07.167
Several months ago, someone
close to you was murdered

11:07.250 --> 11:08.542
'poisoned, I believe.'

11:08.625 --> 11:11.500
Yes. Yes, the Lady Adira.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.292
I don't know if lady
is the correct designation.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.625
She was apparently
a dancer, a former slave.

11:16.708 --> 11:20.417
I know what she was,
and I know what she meant to me

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
if you are even thinking
of using that relationship

11:22.583 --> 11:24.042
against me
with the Royal Court--

11:24.125 --> 11:25.917
You misunderstand me,
prime minister.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I was merely being specific.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.250
In my experience, if you cannot
say what you mean

11:30.333 --> 11:32.708
you can never mean what you say.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.208
The details are everything.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.042
Go on.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.292
Her death by poisoning
was proceeded by rumors

11:40.375 --> 11:43.958
that you had attempted
to poison Lord Refa.

11:44.042 --> 11:47.542
Emperor Cartagia asked me
to look into the matter.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.875
It was easy to see
that these two matters

11:50.000 --> 11:52.458
were somehow connected.

11:52.542 --> 11:56.208
I continued the investigation,
even after the unfortunate death

11:56.292 --> 11:58.667
of Lord Refa on Narn.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.500
The emperor did not look kindly
on unfinished work.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.958
'When I gave him
my final report'

12:05.042 --> 12:06.625
he said that you would
know nothing of it

12:06.708 --> 12:08.375
as long as he was alive.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.125
Since that is no longer
an issue..

12:12.208 --> 12:13.917
There is nothing to know.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.958
Refa was responsible
for her death.

12:18.042 --> 12:19.250
He wanted to punish me.

12:19.333 --> 12:22.875
True.
He was quite annoyed with you.

12:22.958 --> 12:25.833
The liner came to Babylon 5
straight from here.

12:25.917 --> 12:29.208
- Poison was of Centauri origin.
- Also correct.

12:29.292 --> 12:31.083
We found the dealer
who supplied the poison

12:31.167 --> 12:33.833
and confirmed that it
was slipped on to a starliner

12:33.917 --> 12:36.792
en route to Babylon 5..

12:36.875 --> 12:40.583
...but it was not Lord Refa
who commissioned her murder.

12:42.417 --> 12:43.542
What?

12:43.625 --> 12:46.833
As I said, the details
are everything

12:46.917 --> 12:48.083
and we were quite..

12:48.167 --> 12:49.333
Who gave the order?

12:50.250 --> 12:52.083
Your associate, Mr. Morden.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.833
'The dealer didn't know
his motives.'

12:55.917 --> 12:59.208
'In his profession, one doesn't
ask such things.'

12:59.292 --> 13:02.708
But I suspect Morden was hoping
to guarantee his position

13:02.792 --> 13:06.292
by making you turn to him for
support in evening the score.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.000
Go. Leave me.

13:10.083 --> 13:12.542
I can provide a full report,
if you..

13:13.875 --> 13:15.708
I said get out.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.000
[sobbing]

13:28.750 --> 13:31.000
He played me.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.792
He played me like a puppet.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.333
Ohh!

13:40.083 --> 13:41.833
Aah!

13:44.958 --> 13:47.000
[sobbing]

13:48.042 --> 13:49.583
He played..

13:51.083 --> 13:52.292
Aah!

13:54.625 --> 13:55.917
My God!

13:56.833 --> 13:58.750
Oh, God!

14:00.708 --> 14:02.417
[crying]

14:11.250 --> 14:13.042
[intense music]

14:14.792 --> 14:16.208
Can't this thing go any faster?

14:16.292 --> 14:18.750
The captain's gonna need
all the weapons we've got.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.917
[speaking in foreign language]

14:21.000 --> 14:22.208
Ahel.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.333
What's going on?

14:27.417 --> 14:31.083
means continuous fire
in Minbari.

14:31.167 --> 14:32.417
Oh, great.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.875
[speaking in foreign language]

14:33.958 --> 14:35.750
Cease fire.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.625
You know, patience is also a
weapon when used properly.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.375
We will arrive when we arrive

14:41.458 --> 14:43.958
and we will have
the weapons we have.

14:44.042 --> 14:45.833
You cannot win this war
through force.

14:45.917 --> 14:50.208
You must...understand
your way out of this.

14:50.292 --> 14:51.708
Sheridan knows.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.792
What remains to be seen

14:55.875 --> 14:58.500
is whether
he knows that he knows.

15:07.792 --> 15:12.375
Not bad. We still can't win,
but it's not bad.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.792
We can't win?

15:14.875 --> 15:17.208
Against the Vorlons
and the Shadows?

15:17.292 --> 15:18.500
No.

15:18.583 --> 15:19.875
Then what are we doing here?

15:19.958 --> 15:22.417
Hoping that the truth
will set us free..

15:22.500 --> 15:25.000
...before it kills us.
Are the nukes ready?

15:25.083 --> 15:27.708
We've seeded them on several
nearby asteroids.

15:27.792 --> 15:30.000
With luck, neither side will
detect the bombs

15:30.083 --> 15:31.333
until it's too late.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.083
- Are you ready?
- It think so.

15:33.167 --> 15:36.292
'Stay open to anything you might
pick up out there.'

15:36.375 --> 15:37.875
When you came
after me at Z'ha'dum

15:37.958 --> 15:40.625
you made contact
with the Shadows.

15:40.708 --> 15:42.917
We'll need that advantage.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.583
It's the only one we've got.

15:51.625 --> 15:54.500
Ahh...Mr. Morden.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.458
I see they found you.

15:56.542 --> 15:59.208
Good. Good.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.875
You're looking well.

16:00.958 --> 16:02.625
All healed now, I take it.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.250
I'm fine.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.375
What the hell
is going on, Mollari?

16:06.458 --> 16:09.542
A number of Vorlon ships
are on their way here

16:09.625 --> 16:12.542
accompanied by one
of their planet killers.

16:12.625 --> 16:15.042
'They will arrive
in a matter of hours.'

16:15.125 --> 16:20.833
They have been...wiping out
any colony, world, or outpost

16:20.917 --> 16:24.792
where your...associates
have influence.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.667
Cartagia gave your associates
the island of Selini

16:27.750 --> 16:30.333
as a base for their ships.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.208
Now that Cartagia is dead

16:32.292 --> 16:36.417
I am ordering you
to remove those ships at once.

16:36.500 --> 16:39.042
There are three billion people
here.

16:39.125 --> 16:42.042
The Vorlons would never attack
a civilian population that big.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.708
The ships stay.

16:49.167 --> 16:51.250
You're afraid, aren't you?

16:54.042 --> 16:55.458
They're afraid.

16:57.042 --> 16:59.875
And speaking of your associates

16:59.958 --> 17:03.708
'we must make sure that
we can talk privately.'

17:05.250 --> 17:06.875
Do not move.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.375
[zapping]

17:23.208 --> 17:25.625
I will have to have that
painted over, I suppose.

17:27.167 --> 17:29.542
You're insane.

17:29.625 --> 17:32.917
On any other day, Mr. Morden,
you would be wrong.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.292
Today?
Today is a very different day.

17:37.542 --> 17:40.583
One last time,
remove your ships.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.708
No.

17:43.792 --> 17:46.125
You don't frighten me, Mollari.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.125
If you try to attack our forces,
you'll lose.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.625
Yes, your ships are very
impressive

17:50.708 --> 17:53.458
in the air or in space

17:53.542 --> 17:56.625
but at this moment,
they are on the ground.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.833
Fine, they're on the ground

17:59.917 --> 18:02.292
but they can sense an
approaching ship miles away.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.500
So what are you going to do,
Mollari, huh?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.667
Blow up the island?

18:06.750 --> 18:08.542
Actually..

18:11.708 --> 18:13.333
...now that you mention it..

18:14.667 --> 18:16.000
No!

18:16.708 --> 18:18.000
[explosion]

18:39.542 --> 18:42.000
I had most of our people
evacuated from Selini

18:42.083 --> 18:43.833
during the night.

18:43.917 --> 18:46.250
A few stayed..

18:46.333 --> 18:49.292
...to maintain the illusion
of our presence.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.000
They knew what was
being asked of them.

18:52.292 --> 18:54.708
'I would have
preferred another way'

18:54.792 --> 18:58.500
hoped that you would
be reasonable, but..

19:01.042 --> 19:03.625
Take him to a cell.
Keep him there.

19:04.958 --> 19:07.083
You just made a mistake, Londo.

19:07.167 --> 19:10.042
Even if my associates lose
this war, they have allies!

19:10.125 --> 19:13.292
They'll make sure
Centauri Prime pays the price

19:13.375 --> 19:15.417
'for what
you've done here today!'

19:18.792 --> 19:21.042
What I have done?

19:21.125 --> 19:26.000
Oh, Mr. Morden, I have not even
started with you yet.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.250
(Ivanova)
'Ivanova to White Star 2.
Do you receive?'

19:31.333 --> 19:33.250
Susan, you made it.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.375
(Ivanova)
'You think I'd miss
a party like this?'

19:35.458 --> 19:38.292
(Ivanova)
'Listen, Lorien wants to come
over ASAP. You okay with that?'

19:38.375 --> 19:39.583
Fine. Fine.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.375
- I'll send over a shuttle.
- Captain..

19:41.458 --> 19:42.917
(Ivanova)
'What's our status?'

19:43.000 --> 19:44.125
Everything's in place.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.750
We're as ready
as we're ever going to..

19:45.833 --> 19:47.750
Captain..

19:47.833 --> 19:49.875
...I think they're coming.

19:51.167 --> 19:54.167
[dramatic music]

20:17.292 --> 20:19.125
They're heading
straight for each other.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.708
It's as if they don't
even know we're here

20:21.792 --> 20:22.917
or they don't care.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.042
Then let's get their attention.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.333
Which of our nukes
are in that area?

20:27.417 --> 20:29.333
Five, seven, and twelve.

20:29.417 --> 20:32.042
Transfer firing control
to my station, Mr. Lennier.

20:33.542 --> 20:34.542
Done.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.792
Good morning, gentlemen.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.250
This is your wake-up call.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.125
[explosion]

20:57.083 --> 20:58.417
Captain..

20:58.500 --> 21:00.292
Hmm?

21:00.375 --> 21:02.083
They're pissed.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.333
Marcus, what are you doing here?

21:12.417 --> 21:14.292
There was only room in the
shuttle for two people.

21:14.375 --> 21:17.000
I traded places with Lorien,
so he could get to Sheridan.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.667
Figured you could
use another hand.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.292
I'll take it.
Man the weapons system.

21:21.375 --> 21:22.458
Here they come.

21:23.458 --> 21:26.500
[dramatic music]

21:37.500 --> 21:38.667
We have to stop them.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.208
Open up a com channel.

21:41.708 --> 21:44.792
This is Captain John Sheridan
to Vorlon fleet.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.042
Coriana VI
is a low-tech planet.

21:47.125 --> 21:50.208
The Shadows forced them to allow
a base on their planet.

21:50.292 --> 21:51.417
It's not their fault.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.750
You can't destroy
an entire planet

21:52.833 --> 21:54.958
of six billion people
just for that.

21:56.417 --> 21:58.167
No response.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.667
But, captain..

22:00.833 --> 22:02.583
...they may not even
be listening.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.542
[sighs]

22:04.625 --> 22:07.292
Lyta, you were close
to the Vorlons.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.667
They responded before to a
telepathic signal from you.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.042
Can you send it again?

22:11.125 --> 22:13.458
Tell them we need
to talk to them.

22:13.542 --> 22:14.875
I'll try.

22:18.458 --> 22:21.500
[dramatic music]

22:31.125 --> 22:34.667
Ah, Vir, good.
I was about to send for you.

22:34.750 --> 22:38.250
The Vorlons will arrive shortly,
and as we both know

22:38.333 --> 22:41.500
they will strike if there
is any Shadow influence

22:41.583 --> 22:42.750
still here, yes?

22:42.833 --> 22:44.458
Yes.

22:44.542 --> 22:48.750
Well, I have removed
the last of their influence.

22:48.833 --> 22:51.583
Go out into the garden,
you'll see.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.167
Consider it a gift.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.875
Go.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.750
I'll join you in a moment.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.250
[dramatic music]

23:22.542 --> 23:23.875
What do you want?

23:23.958 --> 23:26.167
I'd like to live just long
enough to be there

23:26.250 --> 23:28.833
when they cut off your head
and stick it on a pike

23:28.917 --> 23:30.875
as a warning to
the next ten generations

23:30.958 --> 23:33.583
that some favors come
with too high a price.

23:33.667 --> 23:35.458
I want to look up
into your lifeless eyes

23:35.542 --> 23:37.292
and wave like this..

23:54.500 --> 23:56.958
- Anything yet?
- No, nothing.

23:57.042 --> 23:59.708
We don't have a chance
if we can't speak to them.

23:59.792 --> 24:01.000
It can't end like this.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.750
I won't allow it.

24:02.833 --> 24:05.125
Captain,
the Vorlon planet killer

24:05.208 --> 24:07.292
is almost within range
of Coriana VI.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.042
Shall I call in the First Ones?

24:10.125 --> 24:12.458
John, we were going
to keep them in reserve.

24:12.542 --> 24:15.250
If everything else failed, they
would at least give us a chance.

24:15.333 --> 24:17.333
I know, I know,
once we call the First Ones in

24:17.417 --> 24:20.292
we won't have anything left
to fall back on, but..

24:20.375 --> 24:23.750
...I can't just sit here and let
six billion people be murdered

24:23.833 --> 24:26.208
because they were in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

24:26.292 --> 24:28.167
Send the signal, Mr. Lennier.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.458
[dramatic music]

25:04.583 --> 25:06.792
Vir. Vir.

25:06.875 --> 25:08.917
I have just sent the message
to the Vorlons

25:09.000 --> 25:11.042
told them what we had done

25:11.125 --> 25:13.500
that there is no longer
anything here

25:13.583 --> 25:15.875
that has been touched
by these Shadows.

25:15.958 --> 25:17.875
Sent them all the proof
they will need.

25:17.958 --> 25:19.167
[chuckles]

25:19.250 --> 25:21.333
I imagine
they will turn back now.

25:21.417 --> 25:23.208
[chuckling]

25:23.292 --> 25:25.375
Oh, Vir, we have done it.

25:25.458 --> 25:30.292
We have saved Centauri Prime,
as I knew we could.

25:30.375 --> 25:32.542
And now we only have to..

25:38.042 --> 25:39.375
What?

25:39.458 --> 25:40.750
What is it?

25:40.833 --> 25:42.750
You're wrong.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.667
There's still one thing left.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.625
Something that's been
touched by the Shadows

25:46.708 --> 25:48.458
influenced by them.

25:48.542 --> 25:49.750
What?

25:57.583 --> 26:00.417
[rumbling]

26:02.375 --> 26:03.708
No.

26:04.708 --> 26:06.250
'Not for me.'

26:09.917 --> 26:12.083
They would not.

26:12.167 --> 26:14.167
They would not do it
just to get me.

26:14.250 --> 26:17.042
- They won't know.
- You sent them a message.

26:17.125 --> 26:19.042
You told them
that you were here.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.667
No..

26:32.792 --> 26:35.750
Come on, you bastards,
talk to us.

26:35.833 --> 26:38.458
I'm picking up a message.

26:38.542 --> 26:40.750
The Vorlons are sending
for reinforcements.

26:42.375 --> 26:44.500
They're calling in
all their other ships.

26:46.667 --> 26:47.875
[sighs]

26:52.292 --> 26:55.167
You must kill me, Vir.
Quickly.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.542
And then tell them, show them
that you have done it!

26:57.625 --> 26:58.708
Londo, I can't.

26:58.792 --> 27:00.667
You must!
It is the only way to..

27:09.208 --> 27:11.042
They're leaving.

27:11.125 --> 27:13.250
Yes. Yes, Vir.

27:14.083 --> 27:15.583
They're leaving.

27:18.792 --> 27:21.042
Lorien, you've seen?

27:21.125 --> 27:22.292
Yes.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.833
Can you try to get through?
Tell them to--

27:24.917 --> 27:26.875
(Lyta)
'There is nothing to tell.'

27:37.292 --> 27:40.167
You thought
we could not touch you.

27:40.250 --> 27:41.667
You were wrong.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.167
John!

27:45.250 --> 27:47.083
(Lorien)
No! Do not touch him!

27:47.167 --> 27:49.375
If you try to interrupt,
it will kill him.

27:51.958 --> 27:54.542
And you, they have left..

27:54.625 --> 27:56.125
...for us.

28:08.958 --> 28:09.917
Delenn!

28:10.000 --> 28:11.208
Do not interfere..

28:11.292 --> 28:14.083
...or you will lose
your one chance to end this.

28:14.167 --> 28:17.458
He was hoping they could be
provoked into doing this.

28:17.542 --> 28:19.500
What's happened to them?

28:19.583 --> 28:22.750
They are...elsewhere.

28:22.833 --> 28:26.417
The others, out there,
still work in secret.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.125
But he wanted you to know
what is at stake.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.375
He wants all of you to know

28:30.458 --> 28:33.125
what you may be asked
to die for..

28:33.208 --> 28:34.708
...and why.

28:49.875 --> 28:51.125
[gasps]

28:53.250 --> 28:54.750
I can see.

28:56.417 --> 28:57.917
I can see them.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.167
Where are you?

29:02.708 --> 29:04.125
Show yourselves!

29:04.208 --> 29:05.750
We are here.

29:05.833 --> 29:08.250
We do not understand you.

29:08.333 --> 29:11.250
We have wished
only the best for you.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.042
We only want to help you.

29:14.125 --> 29:16.167
You're destroying
whole worlds.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.167
The others are a disease.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.500
You have given us the
opportunity to eliminate it.

29:21.583 --> 29:24.083
We are grateful.
Why do you oppose us?

29:24.167 --> 29:26.667
Because I don't like
being used or lied to!

29:26.750 --> 29:28.250
We have not lied.

29:28.333 --> 29:31.750
Our goal is the same as yours,
to destroy the darkness.

29:31.833 --> 29:34.375
Then why haven't you
struck at them directly?

29:36.250 --> 29:37.375
[scoffs]

29:37.458 --> 29:40.500
You don't want to answer
that one, do you?

29:40.583 --> 29:44.833
See...I finally understood
the rules of this war

29:44.917 --> 29:48.375
when I saw your
planet killers in action.

29:48.458 --> 29:51.958
You've had the technology to
destroy Z'ha'dum all along!

29:52.958 --> 29:54.417
So why haven't you
used it?

29:54.500 --> 29:56.792
You do not understand.

29:56.875 --> 29:59.083
Oh, but I do understand.

29:59.167 --> 30:01.375
And that's what's got you
worried, isn't it?

30:03.458 --> 30:04.708
A Vorlon said

30:04.792 --> 30:07.875
"Understanding is
a three-edged sword."

30:07.958 --> 30:10.958
Your side, their side
and the truth.

30:12.542 --> 30:15.500
The truth is
we don't need you anymore.

30:15.583 --> 30:18.875
The Vorlons stand for order
above anything else.

30:18.958 --> 30:21.375
No passion, no dreams..

30:21.458 --> 30:24.083
...just discipline, obedience.

30:24.167 --> 30:27.375
They're frozen in place,
an evolutionary dead end.

30:27.458 --> 30:30.083
Why side with the old?

30:30.167 --> 30:32.042
Embrace the new.

30:32.125 --> 30:36.833
Growth through pain and
struggle, conflict and war.

30:36.917 --> 30:41.417
You, of all people,
should understand this.

30:41.500 --> 30:45.250
Your race came out
of the last war stronger..

30:45.333 --> 30:47.708
...better.

30:47.792 --> 30:49.792
How much better?

30:49.875 --> 30:52.917
How much stronger will
they be after this war?

30:54.750 --> 30:59.083
You will rise from the ashes
with a strength and power

30:59.167 --> 31:01.375
beyond your imagination.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.625
Until you do it to us again.

31:03.708 --> 31:05.375
It is the cycle.

31:05.458 --> 31:08.000
It is the force
of history itself.

31:08.083 --> 31:11.167
You cannot win
against that.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.958
We have embraced it.

31:14.042 --> 31:17.333
We've helped it along
by creating conflict.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.125
Weak races die

31:19.208 --> 31:21.958
strong races are
made even stronger.

31:22.042 --> 31:25.917
Evolution must be served.
There is no other way.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
No. That's what you
want us to believe.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.542
That's why
you're really doing this.

31:31.625 --> 31:34.292
That's why you've been targeting
planets that support the Shadows

31:34.375 --> 31:37.083
instead of destroying
Z'ha'dum itself.

31:37.167 --> 31:38.375
You don't want
to kill the messenger.

31:38.458 --> 31:40.417
You just want to kill
the message

31:40.500 --> 31:42.792
make it harder
for them to get to us

31:42.875 --> 31:45.792
guarantee
that we do things your way.

31:45.875 --> 31:48.458
After all, if you
destroy the Vorlons

31:48.542 --> 31:50.083
they'll never know you won.

31:50.167 --> 31:52.792
They'll never see that you were
right and they were wrong.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.792
It's about ideology.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.625
Of course.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.375
What isn't?

31:59.458 --> 32:00.875
Order..

32:00.958 --> 32:02.458
...versus..

32:02.542 --> 32:05.167
...chaos.

32:05.250 --> 32:06.708
Choose one.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.667
Yes, choose..

32:08.750 --> 32:10.958
...but only from
the choices you give us.

32:11.042 --> 32:14.083
Don't you see
that this is wrong?

32:14.167 --> 32:16.625
When the other First Ones
passed beyond the rim

32:16.708 --> 32:20.750
you stayed behind as guardians,
shepherds for the younger races

32:20.833 --> 32:22.708
but you have lost your way.

32:22.792 --> 32:25.667
This isn't about teaching us
or helping us.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.583
This is about you being right.

32:27.667 --> 32:31.667
You're trying to force us to
decide which of you is right.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.500
You're like a couple of parents
arguing in front of their kids

32:34.583 --> 32:37.875
manipulating them,
trying to get them to take sides

32:37.958 --> 32:40.667
not for their benefit,
but for yours!

32:42.792 --> 32:45.542
But what if the right choice..

32:45.625 --> 32:47.792
...is not to choose at all?

32:47.875 --> 32:49.208
What if we reject the idea

32:49.292 --> 32:51.542
that we must decide
which of you is right?

32:51.625 --> 32:54.250
What if we simply walk away?

32:54.333 --> 32:55.792
You cannot do that.

32:55.875 --> 32:57.250
The war will never end.

32:57.333 --> 32:58.583
That is correct.

32:58.667 --> 33:00.083
Then there is no hope.

33:00.167 --> 33:02.458
There is only chaos
and evolution.

33:02.542 --> 33:05.042
(female #1)
'There is only order
and obedience.'

33:05.125 --> 33:06.750
You will do as you are told.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.417
You will fight..

33:10.500 --> 33:13.042
...because we tell you
to fight.

33:13.125 --> 33:16.042
(female #1)
'You will die for us when
we tell you to die for us'

33:16.125 --> 33:18.250
because the others
know no other way.

33:18.333 --> 33:19.917
That's where you're wrong.

33:24.167 --> 33:26.625
You've let them see.
You've let them know!

33:26.708 --> 33:30.083
(Lorien)
'Hurry, take my hand.'

33:30.167 --> 33:31.917
'Quickly.'

33:39.875 --> 33:41.583
I'm fine.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

33:41.667 --> 33:44.083
(Lennier)
'Captain...look!'

33:44.167 --> 33:46.333
'The Shadow cloud doesn't
show up on our instruments.'

33:50.333 --> 33:51.917
(Ivanova)
'Captain, can you receive?'

33:52.000 --> 33:54.333
Ivanova? Did you see it?

33:54.417 --> 33:56.500
Did the rest of the fleet
hear what they said?

33:56.583 --> 33:59.042
We did, but then the cloud
came up all around us

33:59.125 --> 34:01.125
getting through
no matter what we do.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.625
Picking up thousands
of missiles all around us.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.458
Extreme cold's shut down
the jump engines

34:05.542 --> 34:07.750
not just ours, the entire fleet.

34:07.833 --> 34:09.417
Estimate we have ten minutes

34:09.500 --> 34:12.042
before the temperature drops
below that which we can survive.

34:13.542 --> 34:15.583
Is that it?

34:15.667 --> 34:18.458
We come all this way,
we figure it out..

34:18.542 --> 34:21.292
...and now they don't
want us to leave?

34:21.375 --> 34:23.458
[scoffs]
They'd rather let us die here

34:23.542 --> 34:25.125
than get in the way
of their little war?

34:25.208 --> 34:26.542
No.

34:26.625 --> 34:29.292
They're not quite
finished yet.

34:29.375 --> 34:30.875
Look.

34:34.708 --> 34:37.333
They're giving you a chance
to change your mind..

34:37.417 --> 34:42.042
...ask forgiveness...choose.

34:42.125 --> 34:44.833
Your next words will decide
which way this goes.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.500
I cannot help you.

34:55.250 --> 34:59.000
The Vorlons ask only one
question over and over..

34:59.083 --> 35:01.083
"Who are you?"

35:01.167 --> 35:05.750
You, for you the question is,
what do you want?

35:05.833 --> 35:09.333
I have never heard you
answer that question.

35:09.417 --> 35:11.750
Who are you?
want?

35:13.500 --> 35:15.500
(Delenn)
You don't know, do you?

35:15.583 --> 35:18.667
You've been fighting each other
so long, you've forgotten.

35:18.750 --> 35:22.167
You've lost your way,
so how can you guide us?

35:22.250 --> 35:25.125
learn who we are
and what we want

35:25.208 --> 35:26.708
don't even
know it anymore?

35:26.792 --> 35:29.875
It doesn't matter
which side wins this today.

35:29.958 --> 35:33.875
A thousand years from now,
it'll start all over again.

35:33.958 --> 35:37.583
You're as trapped in this cycle
as much as we are.

35:37.667 --> 35:39.000
But we can't afford it anymore.

35:39.083 --> 35:41.792
We don't need it.
We don't need you.

35:41.875 --> 35:45.000
We've learned how
to stand on our own.

35:45.083 --> 35:48.250
We'll make mistakes, but they'll
mistakes, not yours.

35:48.333 --> 35:50.042
Your secret is out.

35:50.125 --> 35:53.250
All these other races
know you for who you are.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.375
So what now?

35:55.458 --> 35:58.208
You do not speak for the rest.

35:58.292 --> 36:01.583
They will not follow you
if you are dead.

36:01.667 --> 36:02.708
Missile on approach.

36:02.792 --> 36:04.875
Impact in ten seconds!

36:12.125 --> 36:13.542
What ship was that?

36:13.625 --> 36:15.458
Drazi warship.

36:15.542 --> 36:17.250
The Strakath.

36:17.333 --> 36:19.500
They took the hit for us.

36:19.583 --> 36:22.375
The other ships are moving in,
surrounding us.

36:31.167 --> 36:33.000
The others have rejected you.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.292
How will you have a war

36:34.375 --> 36:36.000
when no one will fight
for either of you?

36:36.083 --> 36:39.083
We refuse to take sides
in this anymore.

36:39.167 --> 36:42.792
And we refuse to let you
turn us against one another!

36:42.875 --> 36:44.750
We know who we are now.

36:44.833 --> 36:48.083
We can find our own way
between order and chaos.

36:48.167 --> 36:51.667
You can kill us, one by one,
and those who follow us

36:51.750 --> 36:53.333
and those who follow them,
on and on

36:53.417 --> 36:55.083
every race, every planet

36:55.167 --> 36:57.625
until there's no one
left to kill.

36:57.708 --> 37:00.292
You will have failed
as guardians.

37:00.375 --> 37:02.417
And you will be alone.

37:02.500 --> 37:05.042
It's over because
we've decided it's over!

37:06.333 --> 37:08.458
Now get the hell
out of our galaxy!

37:08.542 --> 37:09.875
of you!

37:13.833 --> 37:16.250
As I taught you,
then stepped aside

37:16.333 --> 37:18.042
now you must do the same.

37:19.125 --> 37:21.458
Our age is past.

37:21.542 --> 37:25.917
This belongs
to the younger races now.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.667
They have learned
to stand on their own.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.167
They have learned..

37:31.417 --> 37:34.333
...to understand.

37:34.417 --> 37:36.250
Time to let them go.

37:37.583 --> 37:40.792
Will you come with us?

37:40.875 --> 37:43.208
I have been here
since the beginning.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.167
I will not leave you now.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.750
I will go with you
beyond the rim

37:49.833 --> 37:53.000
and we will see again all
those who went ahead of us

37:53.083 --> 37:57.458
all those who we have missed
for so long.

37:57.542 --> 38:00.000
Then we will not be alone?

38:00.083 --> 38:01.708
No.

38:01.792 --> 38:03.292
Never alone.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.208
Did we just win?

38:24.417 --> 38:26.042
Don't jinx it.

38:33.833 --> 38:37.375
I waited a long time
for someone to find me.

38:37.458 --> 38:41.083
Now, like the others,
I find I hate to leave..

38:42.750 --> 38:46.708
...but none of us can
stay behind this time.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.292
That was why
it was necessary to find

38:48.375 --> 38:50.083
all the remaining First Ones.

38:52.958 --> 38:55.250
This..

38:55.333 --> 38:57.750
...is yours now.

38:57.833 --> 39:02.500
'And you have an obligation
to do as we have done'

39:02.583 --> 39:05.083
to teach the races
that will follow you

39:05.167 --> 39:09.875
and when your time comes,
as ours has, to step aside

39:09.958 --> 39:13.125
and allow them to grow
into their own destiny.

39:14.833 --> 39:20.083
If your races survive,
if you do not kill yourselves

39:20.167 --> 39:23.750
I look forward to the day
when your people join us

39:23.833 --> 39:25.500
beyond the rim.

39:27.917 --> 39:30.042
(Lorien)
'We will wait for you.'

39:42.500 --> 39:47.958
I think about this war being
over, and I find I cannot quite

39:48.042 --> 39:50.875
wrap my brain
around the concept.

39:50.958 --> 39:53.083
I don't know what to feel.

39:53.167 --> 39:55.333
Well, let's see,
the war is over

39:55.417 --> 39:59.583
the Shadows are gone forever,
the Vorlons are gone forever

39:59.667 --> 40:02.792
Cartagia is dead,
and we saved Centauri Prime.

40:02.875 --> 40:06.583
I mean, I'm no expert,
but I think..

40:06.667 --> 40:07.792
...you should feel happy!

40:07.875 --> 40:10.125
[chuckling]
Yes, perhaps.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.458
But every time I have been happy

40:12.542 --> 40:15.333
the universe has conspired
to do something nasty to me.

40:15.417 --> 40:17.917
Maybe, but that's tomorrow.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.333
I don't think any one
of our Gods would object

40:20.417 --> 40:25.750
Londo Mollari having one
single night of happiness.

40:25.833 --> 40:27.208
I suppose.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.125
And you..

40:30.208 --> 40:33.500
...you are going back
to Babylon 5 now, yes?

40:33.583 --> 40:34.708
I may join you.

40:34.792 --> 40:36.333
'I've created
quite a stir here'

40:36.417 --> 40:39.000
by giving the order
to free Narn.

40:39.083 --> 40:42.042
And some have decided
that killing the emperor

40:42.125 --> 40:45.167
was an attempt to
undermine the monarchy.

40:45.250 --> 40:48.167
They have taken it personally.
Who knew?

40:48.250 --> 40:50.667
Once I have
tidied up things here

40:50.750 --> 40:53.833
it might be best for me
to be elsewhere for a while.

41:25.292 --> 41:28.333
[dramatic music]

41:34.292 --> 41:37.375
It's hard to believe
it's really over.

41:37.458 --> 41:38.625
The First Ones' gone.

41:38.708 --> 41:41.708
Mm-hmm. We're all alone now.

41:41.792 --> 41:44.583
Just the younger races.

41:44.667 --> 41:47.333
We can't blame
anyone else from now on.

41:50.417 --> 41:52.417
It's a new age, Delenn.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.792
A third age.

41:53.875 --> 41:55.583
Why third?

41:55.667 --> 41:56.917
We began in chaos

41:57.000 --> 42:00.083
too primitive to make
our own decisions.

42:00.167 --> 42:02.333
Then, we were manipulated
from outside by forces

42:02.417 --> 42:04.500
that thought they knew
what was best for us

42:04.583 --> 42:06.583
and now..

42:06.667 --> 42:09.125
...now we're finally
standing on our own.

42:11.167 --> 42:14.792
Lorien was right.
It's a great responsibility.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.667
This is ours now.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.917
Strange.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.875
The galaxy seems
somehow smaller

42:22.958 --> 42:25.708
now that the First Ones
are gone forever.

42:25.792 --> 42:27.750
It feels like the magic's gone.

42:27.833 --> 42:30.958
No. Not gone.

42:31.042 --> 42:33.708
Now we make our own magic.

42:33.792 --> 42:36.167
Now we create
our own legends.

42:36.250 --> 42:39.375
Now we build the future.
Now we stop--

42:39.458 --> 42:42.208
Being afraid of shadows.

42:48.750 --> 42:51.833
