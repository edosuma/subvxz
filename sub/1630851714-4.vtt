WEBVTT

00:26.680 --> 00:29.240
APPLAUSE

00:33.360 --> 00:35.360
Good evening, and welcome to QI

00:35.360 --> 00:38.280
where tonight we are
swanning around Sideshows,

00:38.280 --> 00:40.480
Stunts and Scavenger Hunts.

00:40.480 --> 00:41.760
Phew!

00:41.760 --> 00:43.560
Let's meet the fairground
attractions.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.600
Roll up, roll up, it's Rosie Jones.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.440
APPLAUSE

00:49.400 --> 00:51.560
The wild man of Croydon, Nish Kumar.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.720
APPLAUSE

00:55.440 --> 00:58.360
Behold, the freak of nature
that is Gyles Brandreth.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.040
APPLAUSE

01:01.840 --> 01:05.000
And the star of
Ferris Wheel's Day Off, Alan Davies.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
APPLAUSE

01:09.120 --> 01:12.240
Right, let's hear how much fun
you're all having. Nish goes...

01:12.240 --> 01:14.760
CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYS

01:14.760 --> 01:16.960
You can't help yourself
but start doing that, can you?

01:16.960 --> 01:18.320
No, you've got to bounce to that.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.640
Rosie goes...

01:19.640 --> 01:21.800
CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYS

01:21.800 --> 01:23.200
Gyles goes...

01:23.200 --> 01:25.240
CIRCUS MUSIC CONTINUES

01:25.240 --> 01:27.040
And Alan goes...

01:27.040 --> 01:28.760
CLOWN HOOTER

01:32.600 --> 01:35.840
How did this woman pick up men?

01:35.840 --> 01:37.240
Oh. Ooh.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.320
Is it going to be with
her teeth or something?

01:39.320 --> 01:41.200
Well, you're heading in the right...

01:41.200 --> 01:44.520
Am I? Oh.
Heading in the right direction, yes.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.160
This is one of
the great acts of all time.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.520
Ah. Gyles?

01:48.520 --> 01:49.960
It's a strong woman of some kind.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.200
Yeah. It's the very first
female body-builder.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.720
The first female body-builder.
Yes. And doesn't she look,

01:54.720 --> 01:57.080
if I may say so, are we allowed
to make personal remarks?

01:57.080 --> 01:59.920
Or will I have to apologise on...?
She's dead, so I think it's fine.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.000
Oh, fine.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.680
She was a fine figure of a woman.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.400
She's called Katie Brumbach,
aka the Great Sandwina.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.280
And if we pull out on this picture,
we can see that she's...

02:08.280 --> 02:12.120
There's rather more to her
than we had first anticipated. Oh.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.880
And what I like is, her act involved
picking up her 5ft 6in husband

02:15.880 --> 02:18.440
and twirling him over her head.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.080
I think it's
a fine way to make a living.

02:21.080 --> 02:25.040
Sorry, I feel like
I need to say it...

02:25.040 --> 02:26.560
Yes?

02:26.560 --> 02:28.360
She's fit.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.160
That waist, those arms...

02:35.160 --> 02:40.000
Oh, the things she could do with me.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.400
Ooh!

02:44.680 --> 02:47.200
Well, she's an extraordinary woman,
she was born in Vienna,

02:47.200 --> 02:49.960
she was the daughter of a strong man
and a strong woman in the circus.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.280
She was the second of 16 children.

02:52.280 --> 02:56.160
Wow. Her father could reportedly
lift more than 500lb

02:56.160 --> 02:58.800
with a single finger. What? Wow.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.760
I know, right? She starred in
the Barnum and Bailey circus.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.160
And in her spare time
she became the Vice President

03:04.160 --> 03:06.400
of the circus's suffrage movement.
Oh, wow.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.320
And her husband Max
would tell a story,

03:08.320 --> 03:11.440
I suspect it's a tall tale,
that he met her when he took on

03:11.440 --> 03:15.000
the challenge of wrestling her
with the hopes of winning 100 marks.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.080
And when she threw him
to the ground, they immediately

03:18.080 --> 03:19.880
realised that they loved each other.

03:19.880 --> 03:23.120
And that there was a good
double act in it, I think.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.920
Have a look at this picture,

03:24.920 --> 03:28.000
we've got her underneath
a human bridge. There she is.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.600
Whoa. Oh. No.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.240
Basically, she's a good egg.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.720
Yeah. She was a good egg,
she was a feminist,

03:33.720 --> 03:37.320
she was a suffragette and
she did good works for the cause

03:37.320 --> 03:38.800
of strong women.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.720
And she was fit.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.280
Exactly.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.800
You know we're all
stronger than we realise?

03:48.800 --> 03:51.480
I learnt this when
I was a very little boy,

03:51.480 --> 03:54.720
because I was born in Germany
after the Second World War,

03:54.720 --> 03:57.480
the late 1940s, not a lot
of work for the circuses.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.920
And my parents engaged
a couple to look after me,

04:00.920 --> 04:03.520
as a sort of nanny and governess.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.640
And they were strong people
from the local circus.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.840
So almost the first things I learnt
were to walk the tightrope,

04:09.840 --> 04:13.240
and to stand on my head,
and to be a strong baby.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.320
We can all do
this experiment now.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.240
Put your hand on your head. OK.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.840
Like this. Oh, wait,
I've got to find my head. OK.

04:19.840 --> 04:24.400
Now, with your other hand, attempt
to lift your arm off your head.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.360
From underneath,
just push with this hand.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.200
Please do this at home
if you're watching.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.720
You can't do it, can you? No.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.080
You really cannot do it.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.320
The strongest person in the world,
that strong woman, could not

04:34.320 --> 04:36.160
lift my hand from my head.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.640
It's all done with mechanics.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.680
They're not
particularly strong at all.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.680
That's the trick I learnt
when I was two and I'm pleased

04:43.680 --> 04:46.360
after all these years to
be able to share it with you now.

04:46.360 --> 04:50.200
Someone told you that
when you were two?

04:50.200 --> 04:51.640
Yes.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.880
And you remembered it?

04:53.880 --> 04:56.400
Yes. How?!

04:56.400 --> 04:58.000
I treasured it. Yeah.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.240
I don't...

04:59.240 --> 05:01.720
Never ask Gyles
a follow-up question.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.160
Sandwina herself had two children
and, in fact, her first,

05:15.160 --> 05:17.480
Theodore Roosevelt Sandwina,
when he was two,

05:17.480 --> 05:19.240
he weighed 3.5 stone - 50lb.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.720
He could pick up a 25lb dumbbell.
Wow.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.160
Sandwina actually got her name,

05:24.160 --> 05:26.320
because her real name
was Katie Brumbach, she got it

05:26.320 --> 05:28.360
from the very first male
professional body-builder.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.640
Oh, Eugen Sandow.
Yes, indeed, darling.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.920
Yes. There he is, look at that.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.320
I mean, there's a use of Blu Tack.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.200
Hang on, are we just, like...
How did you know that?!

05:38.200 --> 05:41.120
Because he was
my great-uncle's godfather.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.600
Not, frankly, that he looked...
He didn't come to the christening,

05:48.600 --> 05:51.040
I assure you, dressed like that.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.160
Gyles, I've wanted to ask you this
for a long time

05:53.160 --> 05:54.960
and I want you to give me
a straight answer.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.240
Are you quite literally
Forrest Gump?

05:59.280 --> 06:04.560
No relation of any kind, but Eugen
Sandow and my great-great-uncle,

06:04.560 --> 06:07.040
I've got that generation right,
they knew one another.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.440
He was incredibly famous.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.840
Even today
the Mr Olympia competition,

06:11.840 --> 06:13.840
the trophy is a statue of Sandow.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.320
The legend has it that Eugen Sandow
and Katie Brumbach once had

06:17.320 --> 06:21.520
a competition to lift a 300lb weight
and she won.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.680
Wow.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.000
And so she referred to herself
as the Great Sandwina.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.400
But this guy,
he could do a somersault holding

06:29.400 --> 06:31.800
a 24-kilo dumbbell in each hand.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.880
He would sometimes lift a dumbbell
that had a huge sphere on each end,

06:34.880 --> 06:36.200
and when he put it down,

06:36.200 --> 06:38.680
a grown man would walk out
of each of the spheres.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.000
I mean, he could lift a grand piano
with an orchestra of eight on top.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.320
Is he enormous?
It's hard to tell there.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.840
I think he wasn't that big.
And the leaf isn't that big. OK.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.360
Now, Gyles... Yes?

06:52.360 --> 06:57.960
Tell me, what's the best way to win
a nonstop speaking competition?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.720
Oh, look.
Oh, look, there you are.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.520
There's a picture of me
in younger and happier days. Hm.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.920
Making the longest speech
in the history of the world.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.120
I spoke on that occasion only
for about three-and-a-half hours.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.600
Oh. I then broke the record again,
speaking for seven hours.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.440
Then for eight hours,
then for 11 hours,

07:14.440 --> 07:16.520
I shared that record
with Nicholas Parsons.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.240
And eventually I retired
when I'd spoken nonstop

07:19.240 --> 07:20.840
for 12-and-a-half hours.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.120
Do you actually make notes,
or do you just...? No. No.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.880
You had to do it without notes,
without repetition

07:25.880 --> 07:27.760
and keeping the audience there,
that was the challenge.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.720
And also staying there
through the night. Hm.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.560
And I...
Could you have a wee, darling?

07:31.560 --> 07:34.280
That's the whole problem. Hm.
I knew I'd need to go the loo.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.480
But this was for a charity
and they supplied me

07:36.480 --> 07:39.680
with an appliance that
you strap around yourself.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.800
It's given to field marshals.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.960
And babies. I know.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.440
It's a full size, for field marshals
on cold parade grounds.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.760
Old men. It's a sort of tube thing.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.440
Isn't that uncomfy?

07:51.440 --> 07:54.360
Well, initially, but it's
quite exciting, actually,

07:54.360 --> 07:55.920
as the evening wears on.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.240
Do you know, it's very funny,
they said, "See if Gyles can be

08:02.240 --> 08:04.320
"persuaded to reminisce,"
and you were.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.000
Well, nonstop competitive speaking
is a sort of lesser-known sibling

08:13.000 --> 08:14.800
of the dance-marathon craze.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.680
There was a thing in 1928
called the Noun and Verb Rodeo

08:17.680 --> 08:19.120
and it took four days.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.600
And you could say whatever
you wanted, as long as

08:21.600 --> 08:23.200
you spoke for 22.5 hours a day.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.880
Could you do that, do you think?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.800
Yeah, oh, certainly.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.600
Don't start, I mean...

08:28.600 --> 08:30.560
But wouldn't that be exciting?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.760
We could do it here
and break a record

08:32.760 --> 08:34.440
and do something useful
for a change.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.080
But repetition was allowed.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.800
There was one woman who repeatedly
recited the part of Lady M

08:38.800 --> 08:40.320
until she passed out.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.160
Another competitor used his words
to propose to a fellow player

08:43.160 --> 08:46.600
who used her time to explain
why she wasn't interested.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.720
And a third said something
so offensive they had to have him

08:50.720 --> 08:53.600
arrested for "loose talking".

08:53.600 --> 08:57.000
In fact, as far as I know,
the longest speech is a filibuster

08:57.000 --> 08:59.240
in the United States Senate. Yeah.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.960
Which was a man called
Storm Thurmond of South Carolina,

09:01.960 --> 09:03.640
US Senator, in 1957.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.040
And he spoke for 24 hours
and 18 minutes.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.240
It's a record that still stands.
Wow.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.160
But he's not my favourite person,

09:10.160 --> 09:12.480
because he spoke against
the Civil Rights Act. Yeah.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.240
What a prick. Yeah.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.080
What... Yeah, yeah.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.120
It's like one of those
Olympic records where

09:18.120 --> 09:19.720
the person was on steroids. Yeah.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.640
Like, it definitely should come
with a big old asterisk. Yeah.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.840
I mean, don't speak ill
of the dead, apart from him.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.480
Yeah.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
You know, I'm going to say it

09:32.000 --> 09:34.440
right here, right now,

09:34.440 --> 09:37.600
I think I can beat that,

09:37.600 --> 09:42.920
because all I need to do is say,

09:42.920 --> 09:46.440
like, four sentences.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.400
All right.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.600
Absolutely, that is one
of the ways of doing it,

09:53.600 --> 09:55.760
just take it very slowly indeed.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.040
But for me, the challenge, really,
was keeping the audience awake,

09:59.040 --> 10:02.280
as you can imagine,
because that was the rule,

10:02.280 --> 10:04.560
they had to stay.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.200
Sorry, I'd drifted off,
I wasn't listening, but you were...?

10:12.960 --> 10:15.360
So, lots of competitive crazes
in the United States.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.240
The late 1930s, swallowing live
goldfish was a competitive craze.

10:19.240 --> 10:23.160
Oh. This guy, whose name
is Lothrop Withington,

10:23.160 --> 10:26.080
he was a freshman at Harvard,
he said he settled his stomach

10:26.080 --> 10:28.240
with some mashed potato
before he swallowed.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.600
Yeah, don't do this, OK?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.000
It's not nice.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.920
And also, in this country you'll be,
I think, arrested and banned

10:33.920 --> 10:35.120
from keeping animals.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.640
The young man who brought
the goldfish looks a bit put out.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.880
He does look a bit put out.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.800
"Well, no-one said
anything about this." Yeah.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.480
"They said, 'Have you got a fish?'

10:42.480 --> 10:44.560
"I said, 'Yes, I've got Geoffrey
and I'll bring him in.' "

10:44.560 --> 10:47.120
What I love is, this guy looks
so sort of trendy and everything,

10:47.120 --> 10:49.320
so I had a look to see
what happened to him later in life.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.560
There's a terrible interview
when he's an old man,

10:51.560 --> 10:54.080
interviewed about his collection
of antique spoon moulds.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.320
And you just think,
"Oh, you were so exciting

10:56.320 --> 10:59.360
"in 1939, now look at you."

10:59.360 --> 11:03.120
But it was a craze, and the final
record before it was banned

11:03.120 --> 11:06.480
was a student swallowing 210 fish
in one sitting.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.240
Another swallowing phenomenon
of the era is one of my favourite

11:10.240 --> 11:13.200
Vaudeville acts of all time,
the great Hadji Ali,

11:13.200 --> 11:15.120
the Great Regurgitator.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.080
So, this guy, he was billed
as the Egyptian Enigma.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.880
And one of the things
I like about him is,

11:19.880 --> 11:22.400
he was Judy Garland's favourite
Vaudeville act, OK?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.480
So he would swallow...
"I love him!"

11:24.480 --> 11:26.800
"I think he's fabulous."

11:26.800 --> 11:30.920
He would swallow increasingly
improbable things and then reproduce

11:30.920 --> 11:34.640
them in an order specified
by the audience. Oh, brilliant.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.520
So he could swallow 50 hazelnuts and
an almond and bring the almond up

11:38.520 --> 11:41.640
at the moment requested
by the audience. No!

11:41.640 --> 11:43.920
Yeah. And his greatest...

11:43.920 --> 11:45.880
"What a great show.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.880
"I love nuts."
"I love the almond."

11:49.240 --> 11:52.200
Why in all these pictures do
there have to be three men in suits

11:52.200 --> 11:54.360
who appear to have nothing to do
with it? No, they don't.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.360
To bulk out the crowd. Yeah.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.920
His greatest trick, right,
he would swallow some kerosene,

11:58.920 --> 12:01.840
then some water, then
he would regurgitate the kerosene,

12:01.840 --> 12:05.600
set it on fire, regurgitate
the water from six feet away

12:05.600 --> 12:07.280
and put the fire out.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.960
How do you discover
you're good at that?!

12:09.960 --> 12:12.200
This is Le Petomane
in reverse, isn't it?

12:12.200 --> 12:14.680
It is, exactly Le Petomane
in reverse, yes. Yeah, yeah.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.680
Le Petomane was
a similar period, I think.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.120
Yes, I think it's about right.
A similar vintage of act. Yeah.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.680
And he was somebody who broke wind,
out of his backside -

12:21.680 --> 12:23.760
Le Petomane could blow out candles
at a distance.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.440
Well, darling, he could do the whole
of the Marseillaise, apparently.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.040
Oh, yes. Yeah.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.880
You can do that.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.440
No, I can't do that.

12:32.440 --> 12:36.200
I can't. Look, all... Look, OK,
Rosie and I spent

12:36.200 --> 12:37.760
a lot of 2018 and '19

12:37.760 --> 12:41.200
on tour together and I...
All that would happen is,

12:41.200 --> 12:45.120
I'd have a Nando's slightly too
close to the show and unfortunately

12:45.120 --> 12:47.840
there wasn't as much privacy
in the dressing rooms

12:47.840 --> 12:50.640
of the regional arts centres
of the United Kingdom.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.720
And so, just every so often I'd hear
Rosie go, "Can you not?"

12:58.280 --> 13:01.000
Why does Nando's make you
effervescent?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.800
Because I have it extra hot
and with a Coke.

13:03.800 --> 13:08.040
And the whole thing goes a bit
Petomane Kumar.

13:09.720 --> 13:15.000
You cannot imagine the stench.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.360
Oh. Nonstop speaking and goldfish
swallowing are both forgotten sports

13:24.360 --> 13:26.200
and possibly should stay that way.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.680
Are some of my other
records on your list?

13:28.680 --> 13:31.040
No, darling, what are
your other records? Oh, well...

13:31.040 --> 13:33.320
Oh, I can't believe
I asked you that.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.080
The longest ever screen kiss?

13:39.080 --> 13:41.200
You?! Me.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.560
Were you alone?

13:47.600 --> 13:50.280
The record was held for many years

13:50.280 --> 13:52.800
by Regis Toomey and Jane Wyman,

13:52.800 --> 13:55.800
the first wife of Ronald Reagan.
Yes, indeed.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.560
In a film called, You're
In The Army Now in the 1940s.

13:58.560 --> 14:02.080
They had an osculatory marathon that
lasted about two-and-a-half minutes.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.440
And I thought it would be rather fun
to see if I could beat this

14:05.440 --> 14:08.680
on screen, and be in
the Guinness Book Of Records again

14:08.680 --> 14:10.880
for the longest
sustained screen kiss.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.000
And this was in the 1980s
and I was on a programme called

14:14.000 --> 14:16.200
TV-AM with a lovely presenter,
Anne Diamond.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.760
And she agreed on Valentine's Day
to give it a go.

14:18.760 --> 14:22.640
And so we began kissing,
the clock was ticking,

14:22.640 --> 14:25.800
but these were the early days
of TV-AM and we had a mission

14:25.800 --> 14:29.040
to explain, and unfortunately,
about two minutes into our kiss,

14:29.040 --> 14:31.800
we had to go live to Moscow

14:31.800 --> 14:34.400
for coverage of
President Brezhnev's funeral.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.240
You killed Brezhnev?

14:40.240 --> 14:42.080
And it was felt inappropriate.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.120
They wanted to put the picture
in the corner of the screen. Yes.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.600
But actually, as Madame Brezhnev
was weeping and the body

14:47.600 --> 14:50.120
was being put into the...
They felt this was inappropriate.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.560
Anyway, so we did not break
the record on that occasion.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.600
But a year later, I thought,
"I'm going to do it again."

14:56.600 --> 14:58.200
So here we are on Valentine's Day

14:58.200 --> 15:00.840
and there is the lovely
Cheryl Baker from Bucks Fizz.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.600
I remember. Well, she's still
lovely, she's still brilliant.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.960
Anne said no?

15:04.960 --> 15:07.800
Anne said two minutes was enough.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.320
Anne said, "How's the Russian
President, before we start?"

15:14.160 --> 15:17.000
Anyway, the long and the short
of it is, I have held the record

15:17.000 --> 15:20.080
for the longest ever screen kiss
with Cheryl Baker.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.360
APPLAUSE

15:21.360 --> 15:23.040
Thank you. Thank you.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.000
Have you done screen kisses, Alan?
They're so awkward.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.880
Yes. I had to do a sex scene in a
train toilet with Lesley Sharp.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.480
Brilliant, brilliant actress

15:35.480 --> 15:38.800
and very nice to do
a sex scene with.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.720
But it wasn't a real train toilet.
It was a studio set,

15:41.720 --> 15:45.440
and to get the idea that
the train was moving

15:45.440 --> 15:49.720
they had a light outside the
window, and a spark with a board,

15:49.720 --> 15:53.840
just passing it in front of the
light, and that's all I remember.

15:53.840 --> 15:58.760
Very heightened passion and just the
other side was a man just going...

16:04.480 --> 16:07.320
Now you can't have sex without a man
outside your window.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.400
About two years after that I would
call him and say,

16:10.400 --> 16:13.160
"I might be in luck tonight,
can you be at 330..."

16:13.160 --> 16:15.560
Right, Gyles obviously finds
speaking easy

16:15.560 --> 16:17.600
but now onto speakeasies.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.880
Which of you would have made
the best bootlegger?

16:22.080 --> 16:25.280
I want to say Rosie Jones.
You would be right.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.200
Oh, really? Why might that be?

16:27.200 --> 16:30.400
I think she just gets away with
a huge amount because she looks like

16:30.400 --> 16:32.160
butter wouldn't melt in her mouth,

16:32.160 --> 16:34.200
but let me tell you, it would,
and it does.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.840
Is it not to do with making
illicit alcohol, then?

16:39.840 --> 16:42.440
It's absolutely to do with making
illicit alcohol.

16:42.440 --> 16:45.080
But why would a female....
Do better? Yes.

16:45.080 --> 16:49.720
Is that cos I'm a cute little lady?
It is.

16:49.720 --> 16:54.760
And I'm like, "Alcohol? No!"

16:57.320 --> 17:01.800
It's the reluctance of officers
to search women. Ahhh!

17:01.800 --> 17:03.840
It was thought inappropriate,

17:03.840 --> 17:06.320
even to search cars
with women in them,

17:06.320 --> 17:09.720
and lots of women, hard to
believe, took advantage of this,

17:09.720 --> 17:13.960
and they reckon female bootleggers
outnumbered men by five to one.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.840
Really? Yeah.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.600
In some states it was illegal
for women to be strip-searched

17:18.600 --> 17:20.440
so they would provoke officers
by saying,

17:20.440 --> 17:22.760
"Oh, it's hidden down the bra,"
or wherever

17:22.760 --> 17:24.640
and threaten to sue the officers...

17:24.640 --> 17:27.160
I don't know why
I suddenly turned into...!

17:28.640 --> 17:31.240
You're like, "Oh, it's that man
with the police..." I know.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.640
The sworn enemies were two
prohibition agents,

17:34.640 --> 17:38.080
called Isidor "Izzy" Einstein
and his partner Moe Smith,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.760
and there they are.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.520
They specialised in costumes,
so they would turn up as

17:42.520 --> 17:45.720
German pickle-packers,
Hungarian violinists, or whatever.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.960
My favourite is that several
times Einstein,

17:47.960 --> 17:50.840
who is the one on the right, went
into a bar and identified himself as

17:50.840 --> 17:53.400
a prohibition agent and the barman
and thought it was hilarious

17:53.400 --> 17:55.200
and let him in.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.880
To be fair to those two gents,
if they were going to disguise

17:58.880 --> 18:02.320
themselves as anything, it would be
"people who are too drunk at a bar".

18:02.320 --> 18:04.640
But wait until you see
some of the disguises...

18:10.160 --> 18:14.360
I love the one on the right.
GYLES: Oh, yes.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.080
That's very Some Like It Hot.
Yep.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.040
Anybody know another country
that enforced prohibition?

18:22.320 --> 18:25.600
Iceland - banned all alcohol
in 1915.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.120
So for 20 years they didn't have
alcohol at all.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.880
In 1935 they legalised
everything except strong beer.

18:30.880 --> 18:35.200
And full-strength beer was only
legalised in 1989. Really? Yeah.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.120
They come late to a lot of things.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.960
I think I'm right in saying
they didn't allow television

18:39.960 --> 18:42.400
on Thursday nights
until quite recently.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.520
They wanted people to read books
on Thursday nights.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.120
Have a drink and read a book.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.360
One of the things they did do
was once a month,

18:48.360 --> 18:51.240
particularly in Reykjavik, they
would turn out the streetlights

18:51.240 --> 18:54.040
and somebody would give a lecture
on the National Public Radio

18:54.040 --> 18:57.080
about the stars that evening and the
lights were turned out so everybody

18:57.080 --> 18:59.720
could see the constellations
clearly. Oh, wow.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.360
That's so... I think that is a
really lovely thing. That's amazing.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.520
I was a guest of the Prime Minister
in Iceland and my wife and I went.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.200
We were staying with the Prime
Minister and her wife,

19:09.200 --> 19:11.680
so just the four of us
in their equivalent of Chequers.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.480
We were shown up to bed
by the Prime Minister.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.360
"Here are the spare towels,
here is the bathroom.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.200
"If you get up in the night, don't
touch the red button."

19:20.200 --> 19:23.600
"Oh, what happens?"
She said, "The SAS will come."

19:29.600 --> 19:32.560
What career skills can you pick
up at a funfair?

19:32.560 --> 19:35.280
Funfair? So not a circus,
more a funfair,

19:35.280 --> 19:38.040
more rides and coconut shies,
that sort of thing.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.000
Exactly that, my darling.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.280
For your career as...someone
who throws things?

19:44.280 --> 19:48.040
I think the fact the woman is riding
a machine is a bit of a clue.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.880
It's flying. What?
I know, it seems extraordinary.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.000
The first ever plane-themed
funfair rides were invented

19:55.000 --> 19:59.960
to train pilots to actually fly
a real plane.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.080
There was an American engineer
in 1931 called Lee Eyerly

20:03.080 --> 20:06.000
and he invented a device called
the Orientator.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.920
It was a small model of a plane and
it could tilt and turn and roll

20:10.920 --> 20:12.760
whilst stuck in a Y-shaped...

20:12.760 --> 20:14.680
This is an extraordinary picture,

20:14.680 --> 20:18.720
because this is Amelia Earhart
in his training machine.

20:18.720 --> 20:23.160
The Cuban government ordered five
of them to train their air force

20:23.160 --> 20:26.680
and it is the only five
that he ever sold, Eyerly. Wow.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.880
Nobody else was interested, and then
a friend of his convinced him

20:29.880 --> 20:32.840
that actually it would do better if
he turned it into a carnival ride.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.920
It was renamed the Acro plane
and it sold ten times as many

20:35.920 --> 20:38.880
as when it was a training simulator.

20:38.880 --> 20:44.720
Is it the same for driving a car
and dodgems?

20:44.720 --> 20:46.320
Exactly the same, darling, yes.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.160
Just go for it,

20:48.160 --> 20:50.440
hit anybody, I think,
is the way forward!

20:53.080 --> 20:56.640
I do have a particular interest
in these plane rides because

20:56.640 --> 20:58.960
the machine gun inventor,
Sir Hiram Maxim -

20:58.960 --> 21:00.880
that's him with the white beard.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.560
He built a fairground ride
with gondoliers which spun.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.480
It sort of flew by virtue
of a centrifugal force.

21:06.480 --> 21:10.440
And his captive flying machines
are a Blackpool ride,

21:10.440 --> 21:14.200
still operating today - possibly the
oldest fairground ride in Europe.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.480
And the guy who built it for him
is the guy in the other bowler hat,

21:17.480 --> 21:22.120
Field Trickett, and that is my
great-grandfather. Oh, wow!

21:22.120 --> 21:25.320
You're turning into me!
I am, darling!

21:25.320 --> 21:28.440
I mean, you and the Prime Minister
of Iceland, you and your grandpa.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.160
I know, it's very exciting.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.320
Right.

21:31.320 --> 21:34.680
Which is easier to do,
get a sonic boom out of a potato,

21:34.680 --> 21:37.960
unboil an egg
or eat your own umbilical cord?

21:37.960 --> 21:39.080
Oh.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.160
Hm. Hm.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.080
Is that what
an umbilical cord looks like?

21:43.080 --> 21:44.880
Not the one in the middle.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.640
Have you not seen one?
No. No.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.720
I was forced to cut the umbilical
cord... Yes, yes. Oh, no.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.000
..of my...well, I say unborn
children, recently born.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.440
It's quite tough.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.280
Very sharp little scissors. Yeah.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.800
You know our friend Brian Blessed?

22:00.800 --> 22:03.360
Hm. He cut an umbilical cord
with his own teeth.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.560
Why?

22:04.560 --> 22:08.000
Because he was, this is a true
story, and were he here, he would

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
tell it to you more concisely.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.640
He was on a walk

22:12.640 --> 22:17.000
and a lady was giving birth,
and in some discomfort.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.720
He went to the rescue,
with his beard, ready,

22:20.720 --> 22:23.360
and tickled her through
the last moments.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.880
And the baby was born
and he realised he was alone,

22:26.880 --> 22:31.280
somehow the umbilical cord had to be
cut and he bit through the umbilical

22:31.280 --> 22:33.240
cord with his teeth.

22:33.240 --> 22:38.480
And I think he keeps a little bit
of it in a sort of jam jar at home.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.120
Please stop!

22:45.560 --> 22:47.200
So we're talking about

22:47.200 --> 22:49.320
the University
of Chicago's scavenger hunt.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.560
It is possibly the most challenging
scavenger hunt on the entire planet.

22:52.560 --> 22:56.480
The challenges have included
building a nuclear reactor

22:56.480 --> 22:59.080
and getting yourself circumcised.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.760
Both have been achieved.

23:00.760 --> 23:03.240
It's the gold standard
of scavenger hunts, frankly.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.760
It's fiendishly hard,

23:04.760 --> 23:06.920
first of all because they don't
tell you what the list is,

23:06.920 --> 23:08.600
you have to find the list yourself.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.920
And there are about 300 items

23:09.920 --> 23:11.680
to either find
or do a quest each year.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.360
So over the years, the challenges
have included unboiling an egg.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.160
Now we've done this, Alan, we did
unboil an egg on the show. Did we?

23:17.160 --> 23:18.400
How does one do that?

23:18.400 --> 23:21.760
What you do is,
you inject urea into the egg.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.240
Piss?!

23:23.240 --> 23:26.200
Yes, darling, I said urea
just to be nice, but, yes.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.800
I used another four-letter word that
I thought made me look cleverer.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.400
What it does is, it breaks down
the bonds of protein

23:37.400 --> 23:38.680
and then you have to spin it.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.880
Do you remember that? No, OK.

23:40.880 --> 23:45.920
Wait, did you two wee on an egg?

23:45.920 --> 23:47.520
We had people for that.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.960
OK.

23:48.960 --> 23:52.320
Because I was going to say

23:52.320 --> 23:56.680
I missed that episode.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.200
Somebody had to get a potato
to break the sound barrier,

23:59.200 --> 24:01.600
somebody had to get a live lion,
tiger and bear

24:01.600 --> 24:03.200
into the same place on campus.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.360
And one person had to eat
their own umbilical cord,

24:05.360 --> 24:08.400
which they did manage,
because it turned out their mother

24:08.400 --> 24:12.680
had kept it as a souvenir
and he put it in an American cake

24:12.680 --> 24:14.520
called a Twinkie and ate it.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.760
Wow.

24:15.760 --> 24:20.160
Um... Sorry, but why?

24:24.720 --> 24:27.800
You ask that question because you're
not a boy at university.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.640
Nobody's found a way to get
the potato

24:31.640 --> 24:33.520
to break the sound barrier yet.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.280
Although, do you know how McDonald's
make their French fries?

24:36.280 --> 24:37.720
Which I've just discovered.

24:37.720 --> 24:42.440
They fire them at 75mph through a
grid of knives that chop them.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.360
What?! Oh! Yes, I know.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.200
That's good, isn't it?
Quite exciting. A rather good fact.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.000
Anyway, the building a nuclear
reactor, 1999, a pair of physics

24:52.000 --> 24:55.600
students at Chicago earned 500
points by building a working nuclear

24:55.600 --> 24:59.480
reactor in their dorm, using
scrap aluminium and carbon sheets,

24:59.480 --> 25:01.880
and it was capable
of producing high-grade uranium.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.680
What?! So, we're going to try and
get you guys to do something.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.040
You should have two balloons.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.120
This is not exactly a nuclear
reactor, but you know,

25:08.120 --> 25:09.760
just to start simple.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.720
I want you to take your two
balloons, or tell me how you would,

25:12.720 --> 25:15.520
take your two balloons and turn them
into a pair of slippers.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.280
I'm going to go ahead and assume...
Yeah?

25:18.280 --> 25:21.160
..it isn't just a case
of wham your feet in?

25:21.160 --> 25:23.840
Putting your foot into the balloon?
Yeah, just straight in the balloon.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.880
No. OK. Because it will break.

25:25.880 --> 25:29.600
Do you chop your foot off?

25:29.600 --> 25:32.560
Chop your foot off,
chop your foot off!

25:32.560 --> 25:38.280
Chop your foot off
and put it in a blender?

25:43.120 --> 25:46.800
And then you pour it into there?

25:46.800 --> 25:48.960
How can I say this? No.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.200
Right. It's never a good sign
when she goes quiet for a bit.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.040
Yeah, just having a think there.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.320
I mean, you'd have to be desperate
to win, Rosie, for that.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.840
I'll do it!

26:01.160 --> 26:02.600
Let's have a look at how you do it.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.840
OK, this is a very
straightforward trick.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.160
So you blow the balloon up
and get the friend

26:07.160 --> 26:08.800
to just hold it like that.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.760
And then let the air out.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.520
Oh.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.400
Isn't that clever?
That's brilliant.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.960
Yeah. Oh, that's good. What
attractive slippers they are, too.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.560
They're perfectly nice, aren't they?

26:18.560 --> 26:21.120
It's a good job I didn't ask you
to make a nuclear reactor.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.680
And are you into this sort of thing?
I was just...

26:23.680 --> 26:25.160
I love puzzles and games. Love them.

26:25.160 --> 26:28.280
No, no, I was brooding
about the circumcision thing. Oh...

26:28.280 --> 26:30.240
I think it was boys only, darling.

26:36.800 --> 26:40.040
Recently, Mothering Sunday, I saw
some flowers in the window

26:40.040 --> 26:43.120
of a shop and I went in and I said,
"Can I have some flowers?"

26:43.120 --> 26:44.880
And they said,
"No. We don't sell flowers."

26:44.880 --> 26:46.640
I said,
"There are flowers in the window."

26:46.640 --> 26:49.640
They said, "We are
a circumcision clinic.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.520
"What do you expect us
to put in the window?"

26:57.160 --> 26:59.720
So the scavenger hunt
as a sort of an idea

26:59.720 --> 27:02.120
was the brainchild of a marvellous
woman called Elsa Maxwell.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.960
She was one of the great party
hostesses of the 20th century.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.160
And there she is in the middle,
there she is with Cole Porter.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.720
And she threw the very first one
in Paris, in 1927.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.320
And the items included,
somebody had to get a black swan

27:14.320 --> 27:15.840
from the Bois de Boulogne park.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.960
Do we get a bonus for knowing
who the other fellow is?

27:17.960 --> 27:20.600
Is it your grandad?

27:26.160 --> 27:28.360
No, it's a man called William Lada.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.880
Who? Well, that's
all we know about him, apart from

27:30.880 --> 27:32.320
he liked to smoke cigarettes.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.520
So you had to get a black swan
from the Bois de Boulogne,

27:34.520 --> 27:37.680
a shoe of the music hall
star Mistinguett...

27:37.680 --> 27:40.520
Do you know about Mistinguett?
I do know about Mistinguett.

27:40.520 --> 27:43.400
She was a great favourite of
Maurice Chevalier.

27:43.400 --> 27:47.000
She was, in her day, the highest
paid female entertainer in the world

27:47.000 --> 27:48.840
and hardly anybody
knows about her now. Wow.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.560
They had to try
and get a shoe of hers,

27:50.560 --> 27:52.520
a red pompom from a sailor's hat,
and so on.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.480
And riots, riotous scenes
across Paris ensued

27:55.480 --> 27:56.720
because of this thing.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.040
And the police came to interview
Elsa Maxwell and said,

27:59.040 --> 28:00.280
"What on earth are you doing?"

28:00.280 --> 28:03.000
And then she named the guests
at her party and it included

28:03.000 --> 28:05.560
the Chief of Police's nephew
and the Mayor's son.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.120
That was the end of it.

28:07.120 --> 28:10.480
The University of Chicago
scavenger hunt stunts are usually

28:10.480 --> 28:12.320
completed by a bunch of...

28:12.320 --> 28:14.000
..undergraduates.

28:17.320 --> 28:21.640
What looks like a scrotum
and loves doing press-ups?

28:21.640 --> 28:23.200
Oh! Nish!

28:28.920 --> 28:31.360
Can I just say,
I do not enjoy press-ups,

28:31.360 --> 28:33.960
so I don't know where you've
got that from!

28:33.960 --> 28:37.040
Yeah, that's ridiculous!
Any other thoughts?

28:37.040 --> 28:39.680
It's going to be something
from the animal kingdom, is it?

28:39.680 --> 28:41.360
Something wrinkly and undersea?

28:41.360 --> 28:43.160
Underwater, certainly.

28:43.160 --> 28:46.160
It's the pleasingly named
Titicaca water frog.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.840
That's my favourite... Ah!

28:47.840 --> 28:49.640
It's nickname is "the scrotum frog".

28:49.640 --> 28:52.080
There it is. You can see its skin
looks much too big.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.840
If you're looking at your scrotum
and you're seeing eyes,

28:54.840 --> 28:56.440
go to the doctor.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.280
If you're looking at your scrotum
and it's looking back at you...

28:59.280 --> 29:00.880
Yeah, it's looking back at you!

29:02.400 --> 29:05.640
Well, this frog spend its entire
life in the water

29:05.640 --> 29:08.840
of Lake Titicaca, which is between
Peru and Bolivia,

29:08.840 --> 29:11.800
12,500 ft above sea level,
so there we are there.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.080
It never leaves the lake,

29:13.080 --> 29:15.320
so it goes for its whole life
under the surface.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.040
Oh, is that why it's all shrivelled
up, as it were? It's partly that,

29:18.040 --> 29:21.600
but there's relatively little
oxygen in the lake.

29:21.600 --> 29:25.720
So the frog's huge skin surface
allows it to absorb as much

29:25.720 --> 29:28.960
oxygen as possible through the skin.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.400
If it ever needs extra oxygen,
it has two options.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.600
It can surface briefly to breathe
through its tiny lungs,

29:34.600 --> 29:38.560
or it can do press-ups
at the bottom of the lake.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.760
What?

29:39.760 --> 29:41.400
To disturb the water around it

29:41.400 --> 29:45.040
and so there's more oxygen which
can reach the skin.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.000
How cute is that? It just thinks,
"Oh, I'm a bit out of breath."

29:48.000 --> 29:49.440
SHE PANTS

29:49.440 --> 29:52.720
The frogs came to fame in 1968
when Jacques Cousteau visited

29:52.720 --> 29:54.400
and he estimated at the time

29:54.400 --> 29:57.680
that there was about
a billion frogs in the lake.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.720
In one lake?! What?!

29:59.720 --> 30:02.720
Well, you're talking about
two million acres of lake,

30:02.720 --> 30:04.240
so it's a lot of lake.

30:04.240 --> 30:09.200
Now there is possibly as few
as 50,000 left. No? Aw...

30:09.200 --> 30:10.240
Yeah. It's such a shame.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.960
Pollution,
humans hunting them for food,

30:12.960 --> 30:15.680
invasive trout eating their tadpoles
and so on.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.880
And they're trying to work out
how to save them.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.040
People eat these, do they?
Are they a delicacy? Apparently so.

30:21.040 --> 30:24.040
Denver Zoo just hatched their
first-ever scrotum frogs in 2017.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.200
Oh, wow.

30:25.200 --> 30:29.920
Do you remember the poet WH Auden
had a face lined, absolutely covered

30:29.920 --> 30:31.840
with lines, like a crisscross?

30:31.840 --> 30:33.720
Noel Coward said, "Picture his face.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.480
"Now imagine his scrotum."

30:39.200 --> 30:42.720
I have a sort of scrotum aversion,
I must say.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.400
Well, finally we've found something
we have in common.

30:49.360 --> 30:53.000
Well...you remember...

30:54.120 --> 30:57.120
..our mutual friend
Maureen Lipman's wonderful line.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.200
"What's the worst thing about
oral sex?

30:59.200 --> 31:01.040
"The view!"

31:04.680 --> 31:05.760
Now, um...

31:08.560 --> 31:10.600
Here's a bit of a spectacle -
how do you think

31:10.600 --> 31:14.240
a fight between a submarine
and a stallion would go?

31:14.240 --> 31:15.720
A stallion's a horse.

31:15.720 --> 31:20.400
Yes. A submarine is a submersible
ship. Nothing gets past you.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.680
They rarely meet.

31:22.680 --> 31:27.000
So, there are a couple of instances
where they have met.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.680
So, 1915, there was a British
submarine which fought

31:29.680 --> 31:32.000
and lost a battle
with Turkish cavalry.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.280
What?! Yeah.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.720
So, British captain,
Lieutenant-Commander

31:35.720 --> 31:37.280
Martin Dunbar-Nasmith...

31:37.280 --> 31:39.960
Oh! Not your godfather?!

31:39.960 --> 31:41.840
But Dunbar-Nasmith, did you say?

31:41.840 --> 31:44.440
Now, you're going to think
I'm inventing this...

31:44.440 --> 31:48.400
I'm afraid that submarine
might have sailed, Gyles.

31:48.400 --> 31:53.000
This man was born on
1st April 1883.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.800
He won the Victoria Cross. Yes.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.920
And I know about him

31:57.920 --> 32:03.000
because I live in the house
in which this man was born.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.800
What?!

32:04.800 --> 32:07.400
How?! How?!

32:07.400 --> 32:10.600
It's true.
It's absolutely true.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.360
How?

32:12.360 --> 32:14.600
And anyway, he was a great man.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.960
And he had many adventures in
submarines. Yeah. He was heroic.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.920
He was extraordinary,
but on one occasion, in 1915,

32:20.920 --> 32:23.520
he was attacking shipping
outside Constantinople Harbour,

32:23.520 --> 32:26.880
and the Turkish cavalry unit
appeared on a cliff nearby.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.960
They spotted the sub and started
attacking and started firing.

32:29.960 --> 32:31.800
And the submarine had to retreat.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.200
So he was beaten back
by the Turkish cavalry.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.000
But horsemen aside,
he was an exceptional captain.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.800
At one point the crew -
and this is such a good idea -

32:39.800 --> 32:42.880
captured a Turkish sailing vessel,
a dhow, and they tied it

32:42.880 --> 32:45.720
to the sub's conning tower
to act as camouflage.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.200
And so when they were
approaching enemy vessels,

32:48.200 --> 32:51.640
people thought it was just
a Turkish dhow approaching.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.440
And then they worked out that
when they weren't attacking people,

32:54.440 --> 32:56.760
they could use the captured boat
which was attached to

32:56.760 --> 32:58.800
the conning tower to go up
and stretch their legs.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.960
But he also had, apart
from resourcefulness,

33:00.960 --> 33:03.400
Nasmith had a tremendous
reputation for gallantry.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.400
So he always used to present
boxes of chocolates to any women

33:06.400 --> 33:09.760
travelling as passengers on
Turkish ships that they'd captured.

33:09.760 --> 33:12.000
He just thought
that was polite to do that.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.920
I feel like we've really
breezed past the fact

33:13.920 --> 33:16.640
that this whole show has turned
into like a posh white version

33:16.640 --> 33:18.640
of Slumdog Millionaire.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.440
There's the film
they should have made.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.080
Yeah, a film called
Posh White Millionaire.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.960
It must have been extraordinary
on the submarines,

33:34.960 --> 33:36.880
though, cos navigation was
incredibly basic.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.880
So it was too risky to surface
with the periscope

33:38.880 --> 33:40.880
most of the time,
so the crew found their way

33:40.880 --> 33:42.960
by bumping
along the bottom of the sea

33:42.960 --> 33:45.680
and trying to match the bumps with
the contours on the map.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.280
And ammunition was so limited,

33:47.280 --> 33:50.520
if you fired a torpedo and it
missed its target and it floated

33:50.520 --> 33:54.960
in the water, somebody would swim
out and get it and bring it back.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.840
They baked bread
daily in an electric oven,

33:58.840 --> 34:02.240
but they did not have enough
electricity to both power the oven

34:02.240 --> 34:06.960
and to run at full speed, so you had
to choose between bread or speed.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.640
Oh, bread!

34:08.640 --> 34:10.040
I know.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.320
Horses were actually transported
on submarines in the same year.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.320
Do you know about that?
Oh, I bet they loved that.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.440
They were taken from Britain
to the Battle of Gallipoli

34:18.440 --> 34:21.320
in the Dardanelles. Ten horses
at a time in a submarine. Wow.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.840
It was 16 days to get there,
they stopped

34:23.840 --> 34:26.800
for a couple of hours in Malta so
the horses could stretch their legs.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.800
Wow! Yeah.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.680
That's not the only time the Navy

34:30.680 --> 34:32.600
and the cavalry have
fought each other.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.520
So, the Battle of Texel took place
just off Texel Island,

34:35.520 --> 34:36.720
which is north of Amsterdam.

34:36.720 --> 34:40.280
1795, French and Dutch were at war
and it was winter,

34:40.280 --> 34:42.960
and when the Dutch invasion fleets -
about 14 ships -

34:42.960 --> 34:45.960
when they dropped anchor
on a strait just off this

34:45.960 --> 34:48.920
port of Den Helder, the water froze
and trapped them in place.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.440
And the French cavalry got wind of
this and they approached overnight,

34:52.440 --> 34:55.280
and they put cloth on the horses'
hooves so that no noise was made

34:55.280 --> 34:56.720
as they approached over the ice,

34:56.720 --> 34:59.040
and the Dutch woke up to find
themselves surrounded

34:59.040 --> 35:00.520
on the frozen
ice by the cavalry.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.160
Wow. And they surrendered
immediately.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.320
What do you think would happen if
two submarines

35:04.320 --> 35:06.200
battled each other underwater?

35:06.200 --> 35:09.800
Is it like battleships?

35:11.920 --> 35:14.560
What, you think they're both
out there, "D3."

35:14.560 --> 35:16.440
Oh, damn it!

35:17.840 --> 35:19.440
You win!

35:21.160 --> 35:24.040
The real problem is, until recently,
it was very hard to tell how

35:24.040 --> 35:26.920
deep the other sub is submerged
because they're... Oh, really?

35:26.920 --> 35:29.040
They don't know where it is?
No, exactly.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.960
But it has happened - 1945,

35:30.960 --> 35:35.600
the British sub HMS Venturer met
the U-864 off a Norwegian island

35:35.600 --> 35:38.640
and they fired six torpedoes
pretty much at random,

35:38.640 --> 35:42.200
and unfortunately the German sub
dived to get out the way

35:42.200 --> 35:44.240
and accidentally went
into one of the torpedoes.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.440
Although, can I just say,
the Germans had the right idea.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.760
Not all their U-boats were
engaged in deadly activities.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.200
They had the submarine U-1231

35:51.200 --> 35:54.280
and it was a North Atlantic
travelling off-licence.

35:54.280 --> 35:58.000
It used to go around and...
The party boat! Yes!

35:58.000 --> 36:00.080
It delivered booze to
the other U-boats.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.080
Right, it's time to enter
the horrible hall of mirrors

36:04.080 --> 36:05.560
that is General Ignorance.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.800
Fingers on buzzers, please.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.920
Which country are ponchos from?

36:09.920 --> 36:11.400
Mexico.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.920
KLAXON

36:16.120 --> 36:18.800
Shall we go through other countries?
Let's do lots of countries.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.600
Central and South America? Bolivia?

36:20.600 --> 36:22.400
Bolivia, no. Portugal? No.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.080
Peru. England.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.080
England, I want it to be England.
Ah, of course.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.520
I want it to be England.
Is it Denmark?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.480
No. Give us a clue.
What did you say?

36:30.480 --> 36:34.320
Peru. Is correct. Yes!

36:37.200 --> 36:39.400
Oh, my God!

36:40.600 --> 36:46.600
This is the greatest
moment of my life!

36:51.360 --> 36:52.400
Yes!

36:52.400 --> 36:54.120
You knew that, right?
It wasn't a guess?

36:54.120 --> 36:55.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.440
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

36:59.120 --> 37:02.080
She's got a few follow-up questions
about how you knew it.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.800
No, no, no.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.920
It's not all about me.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.240
Lots of claims about
who invented the poncho.

37:14.240 --> 37:17.160
In the West we most associate it
with Mexico today, but the first

37:17.160 --> 37:19.600
came from Peru's Paracas Peninsula.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.640
You knew all this. Yeah.

37:21.640 --> 37:26.160
Yeah.
I mean, I'm really bored now.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.880
Blah, blah, blah.

37:31.320 --> 37:34.240
So the oldest recorded poncho
is about 2,500 years old.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.360
Initially for nobility
and embroidered with a shamanic...

37:37.360 --> 37:40.000
If they're recorded,
I mean, in what...?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.800
Well, it's very difficult
to find fabric in archaeology.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.680
There's a problem with women's craft
generally in history that

37:45.680 --> 37:47.840
a lot of those things just perish
and disappear.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.280
The ones that we know about,
the oldest recorded ponchos,

37:50.280 --> 37:53.920
they come from preserved "mummy
bundles" of Paracas. Oh, really?

37:53.920 --> 37:56.400
And the bundle would be multiple
layers of highly embroidered

37:56.400 --> 37:57.520
fabric and textiles.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.520
I mean, it could be as much
five-foot high

37:59.520 --> 38:00.760
and seven-foot across.

38:00.760 --> 38:04.080
Frustratingly, I've just remembered
a story from my travels.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.120
No-one cares.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.800
I care, Nish.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.440
This is why your chat show
is never going to take off.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.280
Most famous poncho in the world?

38:18.440 --> 38:21.120
Clint Eastwood. Of course!
Of course.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.280
For his Spaghetti Western trilogy.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.480
He still has it.

38:24.480 --> 38:27.360
He's had it for 55 years
and never washed it.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.400
That's... And what about the poncho?

38:31.400 --> 38:33.760
Hey!
He's about 100 years old, I think.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.320
He's still working, though, isn't
he? Still carrying on, yes, I know.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.680
Just like Alan. Right, uh...

38:42.480 --> 38:45.360
Now, what's the highest British
mountain?

38:45.360 --> 38:47.840
This is not going to be
the one we think it is.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.800
What do you think it is?
I think it's Ben Nevis.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.080
Then it's not going to be that.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.680
KLAXON

38:54.360 --> 38:55.720
Is it Richard Osman?

38:57.440 --> 39:00.120
It's Richard Osman
standing on Ben Nevis.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.520
What country did you speak of?

39:02.520 --> 39:05.760
So, I said British mountain,
but I did not say inside Britain.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.000
No. Hmm.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.080
In a territory, a territory?
Ah, very good.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.640
Yes, British overseas territory?
So...

39:12.640 --> 39:15.680
The British overseas territory
of South Georgia has Mount Paget,

39:15.680 --> 39:19.000
which is 2,935 metres
above sea level,

39:19.000 --> 39:20.920
so twice the height of Ben Nevis.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.000
The British Antarctic
Territory contains

39:23.000 --> 39:26.400
Mount Hope, 3,239 metres.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.040
Bit of a vexed question
as to whether or not it's British,

39:29.040 --> 39:31.200
because there's only four other
countries which

39:31.200 --> 39:32.760
recognise it as such.

39:32.760 --> 39:36.800
It's certainly the highest mountain
that Britain claims to own. Sure.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.920
Mount Hope got a boost in 2017 -
they remeasured it.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.520
You know how children keep growing?

39:41.520 --> 39:45.280
Yeah, Mount Hope, they found that
it was 377 metres taller

39:45.280 --> 39:46.560
than they thought.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.760
Wow, that's quite a lot.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.360
Did they stand them up against
the fridge in the kitchen? Yes.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.760
No, to be fair, 1936,
when they first measured it,

39:53.760 --> 39:55.600
they used dog sleds
and simple tools.

39:55.600 --> 39:58.400
In 2017, they used satellites,
so...I think it's fair,

39:58.400 --> 39:59.680
it's fair enough.

39:59.680 --> 40:03.120
Even excluding the mountains
in the British Antarctic Territory,

40:03.120 --> 40:05.520
there are so many higher peaks
in South Georgia and Saint Helena

40:05.520 --> 40:08.200
that Ben Nevis doesn't even make
the top ten British mountains.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.760
Whoa. Sucks to be you, Ben Nevis.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.760
But here's a thing,
Ben Nevis, right,

40:11.760 --> 40:14.720
so there's some volunteers,
2006, they're picking litter off

40:14.720 --> 40:17.240
the slopes of Ben Nevis,
and they suddenly came

40:17.240 --> 40:20.640
across a church organ, OK?

40:20.640 --> 40:22.520
Yeah, quite near the summit.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.240
It was entirely by itself.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.680
This is obviously...

40:25.680 --> 40:27.080
Obviously...

40:27.080 --> 40:29.880
I love the fact that
we're so gullible.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.880
We were like, "Whoa!"

40:31.880 --> 40:35.040
Whoa! Whoa, that's massive!

40:35.040 --> 40:37.400
That's so massive!

40:37.400 --> 40:40.280
So, there was a local Highland Games
athlete called

40:40.280 --> 40:42.680
Kenny Campbell and he said
he carried it up the mountain

40:42.680 --> 40:44.960
for charity in 1971.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.360
It took him four days.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.440
When he got there
he played Scotland The Brave,

40:48.440 --> 40:50.760
and then he couldn't be arsed
to bring it back down again.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.200
Well, I don't blame him.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.160
Someone else can go and get it.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.800
"I'm not bringing that down again!"

40:55.800 --> 40:58.920
Now, where's the biggest fire
in the solar system?

40:58.920 --> 41:00.160
ALAN'S BUZZER

41:00.160 --> 41:02.000
Yes, darling?
Is it the sun?

41:02.000 --> 41:04.640
KLAXON

41:04.640 --> 41:06.520
Oh!

41:06.520 --> 41:07.920
The sun isn't on fire.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.960
It's not on fire.
Is it not? No.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.480
The sun's not on fire?

41:11.480 --> 41:15.200
So what it does, every second,
it uses up 700 million tonnes

41:15.200 --> 41:19.240
of the hydrogen inside it
in a reaction which produces energy

41:19.240 --> 41:21.840
and light, but it's a nuclear
reaction, not a chemical one,

41:21.840 --> 41:23.280
which is what fire is.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.000
And that applies to
all the other stars

41:25.000 --> 41:26.320
that we can see, too.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.360
That's a lot of hydrogen.
It's a lot of hydrogen.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.080
I'm worried about
the amount of hydrogen.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.200
It used to be that oxygen levels
were higher on Earth

41:32.200 --> 41:34.280
than the 21% that they are today,

41:34.280 --> 41:36.120
and it's a good thing
that it's not higher,

41:36.120 --> 41:39.080
because if it was 25%,
for example, then even

41:39.080 --> 41:41.040
wet plants could burn.

41:41.040 --> 41:46.040
And so in the Late Palaeozoic era,
the levels were 30% to 35%

41:46.040 --> 41:48.560
and there were frequent
catastrophic fires.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.600
So you don't want too much of it.

41:50.600 --> 41:53.000
But the reason that there seems
to be, as far as we know,

41:53.000 --> 41:56.120
no fire in the solar system anywhere
other than Earth, is that fire

41:56.120 --> 41:57.400
requires three things.

41:57.400 --> 42:01.200
It requires oxygen, it requires heat
and it requires something to burn.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.400
And there just isn't
enough oxygen elsewhere.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.960
The only reason there's a meaningful
amount of oxygen on Earth

42:06.960 --> 42:08.200
is photosynthesis, right.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.800
So there's no oxygen without life.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.160
So if there's no life
elsewhere in the universe,

42:12.160 --> 42:14.280
there simply can't be
any fire either.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.840
You seem to know a lot, Sandi.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.960
Can you tell us, when is
the world going to end?

42:17.960 --> 42:19.720
Tuesday.

42:19.720 --> 42:22.040
No, but I mean, is there
going to be a cataclysm?

42:22.040 --> 42:24.360
Possibly, darling,
but in a million years and, I mean,

42:24.360 --> 42:26.600
you'll still be working, but I...

42:29.080 --> 42:31.040
Blah, blah, blah.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.840
Which brings us to the scores.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.840
Scavenging for scraps in last place,
with minus 16, it's Nish.

42:38.840 --> 42:40.280
Boom! Oh.

42:40.280 --> 42:41.520

42:41.520 --> 42:43.520
Minus 16.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.960
In third place, with minus 8,
it's Gyles.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.200
Hey.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.240

42:50.240 --> 42:52.040
In second place, with minus 5, Alan.

42:52.040 --> 42:54.080
APPLAUSE

42:55.960 --> 42:58.680
And in first place... Hey!

42:58.680 --> 43:01.160
..with a positive 6 points,
it's Rosie!

43:01.160 --> 43:03.160
Yes!

43:03.160 --> 43:05.320
APPLAUSE

43:10.120 --> 43:12.440
My thanks to Rosie,
Nish, Gyles and Alan,

43:12.440 --> 43:15.600
and I leave you with this schooldays
sign-off from Eric Morecambe.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.080
"When I was eight,
I ran away with a circus.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.160
"When I was nine,
they made me bring it back."

43:20.160 --> 43:21.680
Goodnight.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.760
