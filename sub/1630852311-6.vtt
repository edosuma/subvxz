WEBVTT

00:00.584 --> 00:02.419
The battle to control
the entertainment pipe

00:02.503 --> 00:04.713
into your living room
just got a bit more interesting.

00:05.047 --> 00:08.175
Microsoft's Xbox announcing
some landmark news today

00:08.258 --> 00:10.385
as it moves into the media business.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.055
It's time for a new generation of Xbox!

00:13.138 --> 00:16.517
And now, Microsoft wants to
appeal to more than just gamers.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.520
It can also control your TV
and cable box and you...

00:19.603 --> 00:23.315
Everything from your movies
to video conferencing on Skype

00:23.398 --> 00:24.942
to doing all kinds of things.

00:25.025 --> 00:29.571
Casual gaming.
Television. Social, music, and video.

00:29.655 --> 00:33.617
The game console will transform
into a next-generation entertainment hub.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.286
For both gamers and non-gamers alike.

00:36.370 --> 00:41.583
What if I told you, that going forward,
our competition is not going to be

00:41.667 --> 00:45.921
Sony and Nintendo,
but television and media.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.506
Oh, God.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.218
There's a new contender
in the video game wars.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.469
Xbox is going to be...

00:52.553 --> 00:54.847
- The future.
- Truly the future of video games.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.849
Xbox.
Taking over the living room.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.309
Limitless connected
digital entertainment.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.686
You guys never understood!

01:00.811 --> 01:03.063
The company is going
to face fierce competition.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.690
Sniper. Nooo!

01:04.773 --> 01:06.316
It's a ticking time bomb.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.151
It makes me very nervous
to actually play this for you.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.112
Xbox, getting a major overhaul.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.239
A bold vision for the future of gaming.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.783
It's the Xbooooooox!

01:28.881 --> 01:32.968
On May 21st, Microsoft will unveil
its latest Xbox system.

01:33.051 --> 01:37.723
Xbox has been the best-selling gaming
console for 27 consecutive months.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.017
We're expecting a slew
of entertainment options

01:40.100 --> 01:42.561
including possibly
taking over your cable box.

01:42.644 --> 01:46.565
And also delivering web content
in easy and attractive ways.

01:46.732 --> 01:51.403
It was exciting to think about
what a single purpose,

01:51.486 --> 01:54.239
dedicated entertainment console could be.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.784
So we picked that as a path with Xbox One.

01:57.868 --> 02:03.832
We wanted a broad device that touched
all parts of gaming and entertainment.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.126
Go on. Put your hands in.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.837
We wanted
to bring new audiences into Xbox,

02:08.962 --> 02:11.507
people that were outside of what
traditionally was thought of

02:11.590 --> 02:14.343
as our core gaming audience
that was really the intent at the time.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.512
Within the company
there's always a sense

02:16.595 --> 02:18.055
of do more, and grow.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.559
But I think Don was looking for like,
what's that next big leap after Kinect,

02:22.643 --> 02:26.188
and I think there was a sense
that TV could be that thing.

02:26.271 --> 02:30.234
Microsoft's gaming platform
is becoming a true entertainment hub.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.110
It just announced that for the first time,

02:32.194 --> 02:34.738
people are using the Xbox
more for entertainment,

02:34.821 --> 02:37.950
TV, movies and music,
than for playing video games.

02:38.033 --> 02:42.246
Having our team
think not only about gaming,

02:42.329 --> 02:46.625
but television, movies, stories that lived

02:46.708 --> 02:50.212
inside our gaming community,
was something that I believed in.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.256
Okay, this is an interesting idea.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.259
Microsoft's going to get
behind linear entertainment as well.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.302
Xbox Entertainment Studios.

02:57.928 --> 03:02.182
The idea was to take Xbox
the brand from gaming

03:02.266 --> 03:05.477
to Xbox the brand as entertainment.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.521
Movies, music, television.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.939
There was going to be
a number of documentaries.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.777
We all had big eyes for that, it's like
whoa, we're gonna go Hollywood now.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.779
Aaaand, action.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.497
After years in development,
Microsoft's next generation console

03:25.581 --> 03:29.793
was finally ready to be unveiled
at a media event codenamed Newcastle.

03:30.335 --> 03:35.215
Coming off the success of the Xbox 360,
expectations were through the roof.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.134
Good morning everyone.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.345
On behalf of the entire team,
we're thrilled to unveil

03:40.429 --> 03:43.557
the ultimate all-in-one
home entertainment system.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.017
We did a stream from,

03:45.100 --> 03:49.062
around the world, and invited a bunch
of media and influencers up to watch.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.564
We gathered everybody
into the conference room,

03:50.647 --> 03:54.526
we have it streaming on our television,
we're all really excited.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.529
Team Xbox is on a new mission.

03:57.613 --> 04:01.200
To become the all-in-one system
for every living room.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.536
The place where your games, TV,
and entertainment come alive.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.830
We're driven to build
a future-proof system

04:06.914 --> 04:10.459
that brings together the cloud,
smart devices, new content.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.462
We are really excited
to bring the world of Halo

04:13.545 --> 04:16.298
to Xbox as a premium television series.

04:16.381 --> 04:17.799
We're sitting there
listening to it the whole time,

04:18.217 --> 04:19.718
and I remember one of our engineers,

04:19.801 --> 04:22.721
said like, "They're not even talking
about any of the games yet.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.223
Are they gonna talk about games?"

04:24.306 --> 04:26.642
With Kinect, we made you the controller.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.770
This is human control
for a human experience.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.063
It was all about entertainment.

04:31.146 --> 04:35.317
Even a partnership with Steven Spielberg,
and they showed a TV guide.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.403
At the reveal event.
I mean that was really like, the vision.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.323
This is the beginning
of truly intelligent tv.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.616
Xbox.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.784
Watch TV.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.455
You said television.
We wanted to hear video games.

04:48.539 --> 04:49.957
You know, we showed a few games.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.626
But core gamers were left unsatisfied.

04:55.254 --> 04:59.633
We're all in the green room,
and as each person would get offstage,

04:59.800 --> 05:01.426
you know, the execs in the room would ask

05:01.510 --> 05:05.889
what the pulse is on social
and it was not good.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.349
This is not going well.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.393
This is not going well at all.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.815
I am really, really disappointed.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.025
I think I'm going to go into mourning now.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.279
That's how I feel about you, Xbox One.

05:20.362 --> 05:25.200
There were hypercuts released minutes
after the initial unveiling of the Xbox.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.618
Watch TV. TV.

05:26.702 --> 05:27.786
- TV remote.
- TV.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.663
- TV. TV. TV.
- Television.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.956
Television. Television.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.207
- TV. TV.
- Television.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.792
Television. Television.

05:33.876 --> 05:37.212
That was not the right way to unveil
the next generation of gaming.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.846
Wow.

05:45.929 --> 05:51.643
That was the worst gaming event

05:53.020 --> 05:55.898
that I've ever watched, ever.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.859
Probably could have done a better job
of reassuring people

05:58.942 --> 06:00.986
that we were committed
to excellence in gaming.

06:01.069 --> 06:06.158
The response was so negative,
and that was when I knew our lack of focus

06:06.241 --> 06:07.951
was going to hurt us
with our core audience.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.915
I can't... I can't even start.

06:12.998 --> 06:19.129
The Newcastle reveal really was about
showcasing the entertainment proposition

06:19.213 --> 06:20.756
that was going to come with the Xbox One.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.926
We knew that E3 coming up
in a few weeks was about games,

06:24.009 --> 06:26.178
we'll talk about all games
when we get to E3.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.223
In hindsight,
definitely not the right decision,

06:29.306 --> 06:31.850
you don't tell console gamers
to tune in to something

06:31.934 --> 06:33.393
and then not show them the games.

06:33.477 --> 06:37.689
The next evolution of gaming is a

06:37.773 --> 06:40.859
voice remote control for your television!

06:43.779 --> 06:47.115
The Xbox One reveal had
obviously underwhelmed fans,

06:47.324 --> 06:51.662
but Microsoft saw an opportunity
to right the ship just 3 weeks later,

06:51.870 --> 06:54.206
on the game industry's biggest stage.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.500
This is an exciting day for our teams.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.712
And as we've been promising,
it's all about the games.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.674
We're excited to share with you
a stunning lineup

07:03.757 --> 07:06.802
of world premiere gameplay
and announcements.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.931
The ball's in Microsoft's court, and they
come out and they show some games.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.726
And then right at the end
of their press conference,

07:14.810 --> 07:17.563
I remember looking up at the teleprompter.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.357
Xbox One will launch this November

07:20.566 --> 07:25.070
in 21 markets around the world,
at $499 in the US...

07:25.153 --> 07:27.531
$499.

07:28.448 --> 07:33.161
At the time,
the ideal price point was $399.

07:33.412 --> 07:37.666
Anything over $399,
you're in for a real struggle.

07:42.921 --> 07:47.217
The issue was that, with
Xbox One, Don's view was the new Kinect

07:47.301 --> 07:49.803
was going to be required
as part of the box.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.806
So it was no longer just a peripheral,
like the original Kinect,

07:53.056 --> 07:54.892
now you were going to be
forced to buy one.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.768
This is a terrible mistake.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.353
A huge mistake.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.522
It definitely caused a disconnect.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.983
Why are you charging me more money?
I don't want this.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.027
Kinect had so much promise.

08:05.194 --> 08:10.616
It just wasn't ever going to be a thing
that hardcore gamers wanted.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.785
Especially when it upped the price
by a hundred dollars.

08:15.621 --> 08:16.955
Felix!

08:22.127 --> 08:27.674
And then, later that day, Sony
announces the price of the PlayStation 4.

08:27.883 --> 08:34.806
I'm very proud to announce that
PlayStation 4 will be available at $399.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.520
We were surprised by the $100 difference.

08:40.687 --> 08:44.983
You know. Didn't, this, like, it, that's
a pretty big headwind to come back from.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.277
You have
essentially the same hardware

08:47.361 --> 08:49.696
but one device is $100 cheaper...

08:49.780 --> 08:51.990
"Cool. I'm going to go with that one."

08:53.992 --> 08:56.036
And that's where they lost.

08:57.246 --> 09:01.500
360 set us up for being
the best box for developers,

09:01.583 --> 09:03.460
the best box for core gamers.

09:03.836 --> 09:08.298
And we then flipped it around
and said this isn't a dev box,

09:08.507 --> 09:10.300
this isn't a core-gaming box.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.678
This is an entertainment device.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.556
People didn't know what to think,
they were just confused.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.267
You know they wanted to
push into this digital future.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.477
The idea was, all connected, all the time.

09:20.561 --> 09:25.357
The console would have to be able
to check in with Microsoft servers,

09:25.607 --> 09:27.276
or else the games wouldn't work.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.153
Your content is available
and it's stored in the cloud.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.072
There were gonna be benefits to this

09:32.155 --> 09:35.576
but Microsoft did a bad job
of messaging those benefits.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.536
You don't always have to be connected,

09:37.828 --> 09:39.955
but for a lot of things
like multiplayer gaming

09:40.038 --> 09:43.292
or streaming content from the Internet,
you're gonna need an Internet connection.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.710
That's, that's the world we live in.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.963
One of the biggest points of confusion

09:48.046 --> 09:50.382
was how the new always online device

09:50.507 --> 09:55.846
complicated the selling, trading, and
gamers' biggest concern, sharing of games.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.557
We knew the digital age
and era was coming.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.310
We knew it. And the original concept was,

10:01.435 --> 10:04.021
you were going to have to be
connected to play your games.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.981
You're gonna play your games
on your Xbox One.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.191
Here's a disk.

10:07.274 --> 10:11.028
Load it in, and you were gonna have
to get a license for that disk,

10:11.236 --> 10:13.155
but you had to be online
to buy the license.

10:13.530 --> 10:17.242
So it was a great way to not have
people doing big downloads,

10:17.326 --> 10:19.161
but here's the disk,
and just pass it around.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.996
That's it. Simple as that.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.332
Well, that wasn't clear.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.541
It seems like every single outlet

10:24.625 --> 10:25.876
got a slightly different statement

10:25.959 --> 10:28.420
- on used games.
- Yep.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.963
You can't share games between friends.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.466
- You don't own the game you're buying.
Yeah.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.344
Don't, don't pretend like you own
this thing that you just paid for.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.346
And then, stuff got really ugly.

10:38.138 --> 10:42.226
Sony came out, guns blazing, with the
immediate response to the Xbox One.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.312
This is how you share your games on PS4.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.193
Thanks.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.695
One person just hands
another person a disk.

10:54.112 --> 10:57.783
Because you, you weren't gonna be able to
do that with this always online Xbox One.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.034
Your game is your game.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.202
You own it. You can sell it.

11:00.285 --> 11:03.497
You can trade it in.
That was, that was brutal.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.925
As a team you've gotta take some bets

11:15.008 --> 11:17.761
on things that you believe in
and put that thing out.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.472
Clearly in hindsight it was wrong.

11:21.849 --> 11:26.270
People didn't want to spend $499 for a box
to plug into their television to watch TV.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.856
They weren't wrong, Microsoft wasn't wrong

11:28.939 --> 11:32.484
that gamers wanted and expected
more from their consoles.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.904
Absolutely. In fact,
it was Microsoft's fault if anything.

11:35.988 --> 11:41.702
They were too far ahead of where
their users thought they should be.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.872
And there was this whole backlash
that they didn't expect.

11:45.998 --> 11:48.083
In 2013, the world wasn't ready for it.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.295
We got pushback from consumers,
from some journalists,

11:51.628 --> 11:54.715
questioning whether we'd made
the right choice as a company.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.468
It was a valid criticism,
but it was a very binary choice.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.930
And we chose to bet on online.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.518
It was a dark, dark,
dark, dark moment for us.

12:06.602 --> 12:09.521
And, ah, very, very, very painful.

12:17.654 --> 12:21.783
News raced around the tech blogs Monday
that the man behind Microsoft's

12:21.867 --> 12:24.912
future console, the Xbox One,
is leaving the company.

12:26.288 --> 12:30.709
I wish that I would have had
an opportunity to stay,

12:30.918 --> 12:34.171
to execute on the vision
and the capabilities

12:34.254 --> 12:38.091
that the team had created,
but I ended up in the summertime

12:38.175 --> 12:40.219
announcing that I was going to be leaving.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.430
I just remember getting
an email from Steve Ballmer

12:43.514 --> 12:45.933
that essentially said
Don Mattrick has left.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.477
I think we all just sort of
looked at each other

12:48.560 --> 12:51.104
and were like,
"Okay so, what happens now?"

12:52.523 --> 12:53.690
There was no fear.

12:54.816 --> 12:55.901
No failure.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.030
But the rules have changed.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.540
It was a long road,
and a long path from there,

13:09.748 --> 13:12.334
but the team didn't give up,
didn't wanna quit,

13:12.417 --> 13:14.461
didn't feel like
we couldn't overcome this,

13:14.545 --> 13:17.923
and, we still had to come out
and deliver the console.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.093
Well it's here. Xbox One, finally on sale.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.055
- Xbox One!
We had a line of people

13:25.138 --> 13:27.099
at the launch event,
people were excited about it.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.477
We had kind of an early signal
that maybe things were okay.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.688
The MBD group has revealed that Xbox One

13:32.771 --> 13:35.566
led console sales in December,
and with its $500 price point,

13:35.649 --> 13:38.902
the Xbox One led annual hardware sales
on a dollars basis.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.073
But, by April, we were outsold six-

13:43.156 --> 13:45.868
or seven-to-one in the market,
maybe eight-to-one.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.666
This was really bad.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.251
Like catastrophic bad.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.757
The reality is when you
have moments like this,

14:01.341 --> 14:05.429
the, the future of the brand is at stake.

14:05.721 --> 14:10.434
You question whether or not
you're gonna be here in five years.

14:10.684 --> 14:16.440
It's never a given that you're gonna get
to make another generation of a console.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.818
Brands die every day.

14:19.902 --> 14:25.616
No one's playing on an Atari anymore,
like nobody is playing on a Sega Genesis.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.492
We felt like our future was at stake.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.246
I think Microsoft learned the hard way,

14:34.416 --> 14:38.462
if you take your eye off the ball,
and if you don't put gamers and games

14:38.545 --> 14:42.299
at the center of your ambitions,
it's going to come back and bite you.

14:44.468 --> 14:45.719
Our fans had lost faith.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.054
It's collapsing.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.556
Move it! Move, move, move!

14:51.517 --> 14:55.187
How do we re-earn the trust of customers?

14:55.270 --> 14:59.441
One thing that was very clear,
more of the same was not gonna work.

15:02.361 --> 15:05.030
Today Microsoft has announced
that the Microsoft Studios

15:05.113 --> 15:06.406
corporate vice president Phil...

15:06.490 --> 15:08.325
Spencer is the new head of Xbox.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.369
Let's talk about your new role.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.537
What are you gonna be doing?

15:12.246 --> 15:16.917
The emergency glass was shattered
and Phil was pulled out and put in

15:17.000 --> 15:19.336
to right the Xbox ship that was sinking.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.923
He was there early days,
studied under Ed Fries,

15:23.006 --> 15:25.717
so he knew exactly what made
the original Xbox work.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.971
He was a gamer. But he was also
a longtime Microsoft guy,

15:29.054 --> 15:30.597
so he's sort of the perfect hybrid.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.225
He is a proxy for gamers.

15:33.308 --> 15:34.685
They believe in Phil.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.104
I play lots of games with Phil
on weekends and evenings,

15:37.187 --> 15:39.106
and he's always thinking
about the player first.

15:39.314 --> 15:43.569
Having someone lead the platform,
who comes from that place.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.237
It was a big turning point for us.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.573
We needed somebody that could lead us,

15:47.656 --> 15:49.992
that we trusted,
that cared about the team.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.789
I had no training
in running a team of that size,

15:55.873 --> 15:58.208
or the platform team or the hardware team.

15:58.292 --> 16:01.295
So I knew that it would be a challenge.

16:01.378 --> 16:05.340
One of the things that was really hard
about the Xbox One launch was,

16:05.424 --> 16:08.010
Phil had more than a broken business,
he had a broken culture.

16:08.552 --> 16:11.305
There were people who would
literally come up to me in, in tears.

16:11.388 --> 16:15.058
Who had killed themselves
to try to get a product into market.

16:15.559 --> 16:18.228
The product did not make gamers happy.

16:18.312 --> 16:21.899
So I knew we had to get the team onboard,
we have to believe in why we're here.

16:21.982 --> 16:25.777
The first thing that Phil did
was he went after culture.

16:25.861 --> 16:29.198
I wanted to try to continue to see Xbox

16:29.281 --> 16:32.910
be an important brand in gaming,
but it's not just about me.

16:32.993 --> 16:37.039
As a leader you realize
that if we can't empower our great people

16:37.122 --> 16:39.249
to do great things that we should give up.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.587
I knew that this effort
would take the entire team,

16:44.087 --> 16:47.382
and it was gonna be incredibly hard.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.847
Under Phil's leadership,
and with a green light from Microsoft,

16:53.931 --> 16:58.852
the Xbox team launched a plan to pull back
from the edge of console obscurity.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.063
Xbox had a lot of plates to spin.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.357
They had to gain the trust of developers,

17:03.482 --> 17:05.359
they had to make
a statement with the gamers,

17:05.442 --> 17:07.694
reverse all of the messaging
that they made,

17:07.778 --> 17:10.614
and that's not a switch
that you flip overnight.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.659
That can take years. Years.

17:13.742 --> 17:17.496
I don't think there was a question
around where I wanted to focus.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.791
We know that day-one customer
every year has to be the gamer,

17:20.874 --> 17:22.626
you expand from that gaming audience out.

17:25.254 --> 17:30.551
With Phil being in charge, it sort of
cemented putting a game face back on Xbox.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.137
- Marty? Big news today.
- Yeah?

17:34.221 --> 17:35.305
Yeah, bombshells.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.310
Microsoft announced that a
Kinect-less Xbox One is coming June 9th.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.771
Yeah. For $399.
Yeah.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.565
One of the decisions that we had made

17:44.648 --> 17:46.984
is that we were gonna offer
Xbox One without Kinect,

17:47.067 --> 17:49.361
and lower the price by $100.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.781
This is what everyone wanted.

17:52.865 --> 17:55.534
Xbox Entertainment Studios,
which is better known

17:55.617 --> 17:58.120
as the TV division, has been shut down.

17:58.912 --> 18:04.293
Shutting down Xbox Entertainment Studios
was really just tradeoffs we had to make.

18:04.376 --> 18:08.005
All of the investments that you're making
in that entertainment, the movies,

18:08.088 --> 18:10.716
the TV shows, and things,
are going to come at the expense

18:10.799 --> 18:13.010
of making the same investments in games.

18:13.552 --> 18:17.347
And, we still had more games
we needed to make.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.437
Microsoft has announced a new platform
for independent developers

18:23.520 --> 18:25.856
looking to bring their games to Xbox One.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.401
Game content is the thing
that's gonna drive our success

18:29.484 --> 18:31.236
as much as anything else that we do.

18:31.653 --> 18:35.365
We needed external independent developers
to be successful on our platform.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.159
Independent developers

18:37.242 --> 18:40.996
have fundamentally changed
the way we play games this generation.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.540
The smartest move that Microsoft made was,

18:43.624 --> 18:45.459
they took Chris Charla,
who was a developer,

18:45.542 --> 18:47.377
and said we're gonna allow self-publishing

18:47.461 --> 18:48.795
and this is the guy who's gonna
really help with that.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.799
Players don't care
if it's from a big company,

18:52.966 --> 18:55.260
or a single person,
they just wanna play fun games,

18:55.344 --> 18:58.805
and our job as a platform holder
is to make that happen.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.225
This was a guy who was a developer,

19:01.308 --> 19:02.935
smart guy, he understands the community,

19:03.310 --> 19:05.687
he's been there himself,
he was great in that role.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.315
Major League Baseball
publishes a baseball game

19:08.398 --> 19:09.691
through the ID@Xbox program.

19:09.983 --> 19:13.028
Fortnite, from Epic,
came through the ID@Xbox program.

19:13.445 --> 19:14.613
We have the ability to get, you know,

19:14.696 --> 19:16.949
our small, cool little ideas
up on the big screen.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.536
It's just an amazing experience
that none of us really saw coming.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.625
Back when Microsoft said
Phil's gonna be in charge,

19:26.875 --> 19:29.211
our faith went way up
that things were gonna change

19:29.294 --> 19:32.422
and then right away they did,
and then when Microsoft showed

19:32.506 --> 19:35.509
that they were making these moves,
you were like, this has all the

19:35.592 --> 19:39.930
opportunities to really go the right way,
but the gamers were still upset,

19:40.013 --> 19:43.016
and you're like,
"Well look, it's a big ship,

19:43.392 --> 19:46.019
but the changes they just made,
give them a chance."

19:46.520 --> 19:50.148
While lowering the price
of Xbox One and reprioritizing developers

19:50.232 --> 19:53.527
were major steps towards getting back
into the good graces of gamers,

19:53.735 --> 19:57.364
a desire to enlist
an entirely new generation of players

19:57.447 --> 20:00.993
inspired Xbox to go somewhere
it had never been before.

20:01.618 --> 20:05.289
Let's go to a place
where everything is made of blocks.

20:05.956 --> 20:08.625
Where the only limit is your imagination.

20:08.709 --> 20:13.046
The team said, how many kids have
their first experience with any video game

20:13.130 --> 20:17.301
with mom or dad's cell phone
in the back seat playing Minecraft?

20:17.384 --> 20:20.137
The company that is known
for Windows and word processors,

20:20.429 --> 20:25.142
will pay two-and-a-half billion dollars
for Swedish game developer Mojang,

20:25.225 --> 20:29.897
that is the company behind the wildly
successful, ever-popular Minecraft game.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.815
No, they're gonna mess it up!

20:33.192 --> 20:36.069
Right after the acquisition,
all of the public perception

20:36.153 --> 20:38.238
when you read about in the press
was that evil Microsoft

20:38.322 --> 20:39.948
was going to come ruin Minecraft.

20:40.032 --> 20:43.785
Can Microsoft keep its hands off Minecraft
and just keep that, that pure experience.

20:43.869 --> 20:47.623
There was an assumption, you know again
that old console war thinking,

20:47.706 --> 20:54.087
that Microsoft would pull it off of any
platforms that weren't Windows or Xbox.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.382
There certainly could have been
a decision that look, we just paid

20:57.466 --> 21:01.470
a bunch of money for this game,
we need it to go help Xbox so from now on,

21:01.595 --> 21:04.097
the only place you're gonna be able
to play Minecraft is on Xbox.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.517
There's gotta be something
bigger going on here.

21:07.434 --> 21:11.730
But I'm grateful that Phil Spencer
understood that what we had

21:11.813 --> 21:14.233
was a cultural phenomenon
and what we had acquired

21:14.316 --> 21:18.111
almost as much as a game
was the community that came with it.

21:18.195 --> 21:22.241
Go Red Side, go! C'mon Red Side! C'mon!

21:22.324 --> 21:23.659
The world is changing

21:23.742 --> 21:27.788
and the idea that limiting the places

21:27.871 --> 21:31.041
where people can experience your games
is not always right.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.587
Whether you're playing
on an Xbox, PlayStation,

21:35.671 --> 21:40.133
an Android, iOS device,
our goal is to continue to evolve

21:40.217 --> 21:42.427
and innovate with Minecraft
across all those platforms.

21:42.511 --> 21:44.763
Woohoo!

21:47.099 --> 21:48.725
The decision to make Minecraft

21:48.809 --> 21:52.020
accessible across all platforms
surprised the industry,

21:52.271 --> 21:56.108
but Xbox had something on the horizon
that would upend it.

21:56.859 --> 21:58.527
Wondering what's going on, eh?

21:58.610 --> 22:00.654
Wonderful. Let's get started!

22:00.737 --> 22:03.156
With all of the things
that we're trying to go do,

22:03.240 --> 22:06.827
creating Game Pass,
was a decision that was gonna be

22:06.910 --> 22:08.579
disruptive to the industry.

22:09.705 --> 22:10.747
Oh, hey!

22:10.831 --> 22:12.541
Game Pass was the first service

22:12.624 --> 22:14.334
where you'd have access
to a library of games

22:14.418 --> 22:17.129
and you could download and play the games
in their full fidelity locally.

22:19.923 --> 22:23.385
We heard from people who said
buying multiple $70 games

22:23.468 --> 22:25.345
is actually just
economically not possible.

22:25.804 --> 22:28.307
And people wanted to play across devices.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.976
With Game Pass, you now have
a shared library with your friends,

22:31.059 --> 22:34.688
and you can just decide to say, "Hey,
let's go, let's go jump on and play this."

22:37.065 --> 22:39.651
What we learned as part of it
was kind of not necessarily

22:39.735 --> 22:42.196
something we do at the beginning,
it became this part of the journey

22:42.279 --> 22:44.865
is it also created
enormous value for publishers.

22:44.948 --> 22:48.785
Developers that might not have had
the front row or front seat.

22:49.036 --> 22:52.206
They're in there,
and they're on the same level as Halo.

22:53.123 --> 22:55.542
You know when you're building a game,
if you're not a known IP,

22:55.626 --> 22:57.044
it's really easy to get lost.

22:59.922 --> 23:03.717
The biggest thing about Game Pass
is the amount of players.

23:04.384 --> 23:08.555
I can put a game into Game Pass
and 10 million players

23:08.639 --> 23:11.433
can show up the next day
who might not have decided

23:11.517 --> 23:13.685
to plunk down $60 for my game.

23:13.769 --> 23:16.146
It lowers the barrier to entry,

23:16.230 --> 23:19.650
it makes it easier for you
to experiment and choose.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.402
The people that subscribe
actually play more games.

23:22.486 --> 23:26.323
It's just like flick, flick, flick,
oh yeah I'll play this one for a while.

23:26.406 --> 23:29.409
And now you see other companies
considering and moving

23:29.493 --> 23:30.786
in faster to the Game Pass model.

23:30.869 --> 23:33.413
Game Pass is probably the future
of how we distribute games.

23:39.628 --> 23:42.798
Game Pass revolutionized
the landscape of video gaming,

23:42.881 --> 23:44.508
but in order to get the most

23:44.591 --> 23:46.760
out of the tsunami of new content
they were providing,

23:46.844 --> 23:49.638
Xbox knew it was time to up the ante.

23:52.850 --> 23:57.312
When we launched the original Xbox,
we had this tagline.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.022
"There's no power greater than X."

23:59.314 --> 24:02.109
And we were the most powerful.
And we owned that.

24:02.401 --> 24:03.986
That's what our gamers expected from us.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.446
That's what we had delivered um, early on.

24:06.530 --> 24:08.156
We were always the most powerful console.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.659
And we lost that with Xbox One.

24:11.535 --> 24:13.787
As we thought about broadening
what the Xbox One did,

24:13.871 --> 24:18.208
we had sort of lost sight of first
and foremost, this is a gaming machine.

24:19.376 --> 24:22.504
The PlayStation 4
was a technically superior experience.

24:23.005 --> 24:25.507
You know, one friend tells his friends,

24:25.591 --> 24:28.927
"Hey, it's better on PlayStation 4,
you should play it over there,"

24:29.011 --> 24:30.637
and that just spreads.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.640
You know if we were a car company,
we always made the fastest car.

24:34.016 --> 24:35.767
That's what, was what our brand was.

24:36.268 --> 24:39.563
But for us to get back
to what we were always about,

24:39.646 --> 24:44.359
we needed a console that would be
more powerful than any other console.

24:44.651 --> 24:48.071
It was about reclaiming
the horsepower narrative.

24:52.743 --> 24:56.788
So Phil delivered Project Scorpio,
which they called the Xbox One X.

24:57.122 --> 25:01.919
We went back to our roots of being
the most powerful console ever built.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.714
More power, more pixels, more framerate.

25:05.797 --> 25:09.718
It was all about core gaming goodness.

25:09.801 --> 25:10.969
- True 4
- K gaming.

25:12.054 --> 25:15.015
They engineer
the world's most powerful console,

25:15.349 --> 25:17.935
they win back a lot
of gamer trust with that.

25:19.228 --> 25:25.067
This monster was almost like the rebirth
of the Xbox brand to continue to make sure

25:25.150 --> 25:27.653
there is no power greater than X
as we thought about the future.

25:29.613 --> 25:32.074
The most powerful console,
it's a thing of beauty.

25:32.157 --> 25:34.076
I think the big thing for me
is just games.

25:37.996 --> 25:40.582
How do we deliver
the best games to people?

25:41.375 --> 25:43.669
Get the games that our players love?

25:43.752 --> 25:45.420
We said, you know, content is critical.

25:45.838 --> 25:47.589
And one of the best ways

25:47.673 --> 25:50.092
to get the best games
is to invest in studios.

25:50.175 --> 25:51.426
That's what we like to see.

25:51.510 --> 25:54.137
But making games is hard,
it's complicated,

25:54.513 --> 25:56.306
it's about hey, can a group of people

25:56.390 --> 25:58.809
actually effectively
create something together?

25:59.560 --> 26:00.811
We have to be really thoughtful

26:00.894 --> 26:03.730
and mindful about respecting the culture

26:03.814 --> 26:07.401
and the heritage of the studio
but also infusing, you know,

26:07.484 --> 26:08.944
kind of the power of Microsoft.

26:09.027 --> 26:10.821
There's no magic formula for that,

26:10.904 --> 26:12.865
you know, I think that's more
of an art than a science.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.951
One of the biggest missteps

26:16.034 --> 26:18.954
that we learned from
in the past was Lionhead.

26:19.955 --> 26:23.876
We had already published Fable 1,
and it was a hit, people loved it,

26:23.959 --> 26:27.337
the beauty of that game,
it was basically like a moving

26:27.421 --> 26:30.591
stained-glass window, people wanted more,
and so we bought Lionhead.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.551
Those were good years.

26:32.885 --> 26:34.344
The game was great.

26:34.511 --> 26:35.929
Just everything came together.

26:36.513 --> 26:38.974
But after Fable II, Kinect came along,

26:39.057 --> 26:42.394
and the Fable-Kinect marriage
just never really took.

26:42.728 --> 26:45.314
And then Fable Journey
was a passion project

26:45.397 --> 26:47.733
for a lot of people,
but I think it deviated

26:47.816 --> 26:51.987
pretty significantly from the pillars
of what made Fable 1 and 2 so popular.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.823
Some very, very sad news
coming out of Microsoft today.

26:54.907 --> 26:57.743
They're shutting down Fable
developer Lionhead Studios.

26:57.826 --> 26:59.995
We acquired Lionhead in 2006.

27:00.454 --> 27:02.748
Shut it down in 2016.

27:02.915 --> 27:05.959
A couple years later,
we reflected back on that experience.

27:06.043 --> 27:09.004
What did we learn,
how do we not repeat our same mistakes?

27:09.087 --> 27:12.424
You acquire a studio
for what they're great at now,

27:12.883 --> 27:16.970
and your job is to help them accelerate
how they do what they do.

27:17.054 --> 27:19.431
Not them accelerate what you do.

27:19.515 --> 27:22.976
I wish Lionhead
were still a viable studio.

27:25.437 --> 27:30.609
It is only when you fall
that you learn whether you can fly.

27:31.777 --> 27:35.614
When we launched Xbox One X in 2017,

27:35.697 --> 27:38.867
we knew studio acquisitions
were gonna be huge for us.

27:38.951 --> 27:41.703
The studios we had
were creating amazing games,

27:41.787 --> 27:45.374
but we wanted to have more,
and the challenges that

27:45.457 --> 27:49.461
we went through with Lionhead
taught us what to do this time.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.672
Welcome to E3 2018.

27:52.005 --> 27:54.508
So with the many failures of the Xbox One,

27:54.591 --> 27:58.178
they're a distant second to Sony,
but, to their credit,

27:58.512 --> 28:05.102
they had been doing everything right,
the potential is there at E3 2018

28:05.185 --> 28:09.064
to regain that foothold
in the upcoming next generation.

28:09.147 --> 28:13.777
We know that exclusive games
from our Microsoft Studios

28:14.111 --> 28:17.614
are what originally turned
so many of us into Xbox fans.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.409
The first and greatest instance of us

28:20.492 --> 28:24.955
showcasing what we do for players
is what we do with our studios.

28:26.498 --> 28:28.333
Phil, he took out the credit card,

28:28.417 --> 28:31.378
went on a shopping spree,
bought some amazing companies.

28:31.587 --> 28:32.671
Started promising games.

28:33.964 --> 28:38.635
I'm excited to welcome Undead Labs
to Microsoft Studios.

28:38.969 --> 28:41.180
It doesn't matter what your technology is.

28:41.263 --> 28:43.473
If you don't have the games, we were done.

28:43.682 --> 28:44.850
Content is king.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.351
Ninja Theory.

28:46.435 --> 28:47.978
Compulsion Games.

28:48.061 --> 28:51.273
Brand new Microsoft studio.
The Initiative.

28:51.648 --> 28:52.816
Playground Games.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.320
Yesterday was a huge moment.

28:56.403 --> 28:59.615
You brought not 1, not 2
not 3, not 4, but 5 new studios...

29:00.240 --> 29:03.160
The acquisitions kept coming
at a blistering pace.

29:03.869 --> 29:09.291
We'll be acquiring InExile Entertainment,
Obsidian Entertainment.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.668
We doubled the number of internal studios

29:11.752 --> 29:14.838
to 15 internal studios
and made a big group of acquisitions.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.007
Double Fine Productions.

29:17.799 --> 29:22.429
Buying all those studios, Microsoft
focused back on the hardcore gamer.

29:22.513 --> 29:24.431
We're highlighting 60 games for you.

29:24.515 --> 29:27.809
Fourteen games from Xbox Games Studios.

29:27.893 --> 29:32.940
And over 30 games
premiering in Xbox Game Pass.

29:33.023 --> 29:34.358
Let's jump in.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.531
This volley of acquisitions
created one of the largest,

29:40.614 --> 29:42.574
most diverse catalogs in the industry.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.953
But Microsoft had its eye on more target.

29:46.036 --> 29:48.163
And it was a big one.

29:52.668 --> 29:56.296
We're really delighted to reach
this agreement with ZeniMax

29:56.380 --> 29:58.966
and bring Bethesda
into the Microsoft family.

29:59.049 --> 30:03.637
The move adds eight more studios
to Xbox's first-party portfolio,

30:03.929 --> 30:07.516
including Bethesda Game Studios,
ID Software, Arkane,

30:07.975 --> 30:10.352
MachineGames, Tango Gameworks, and more.

30:10.936 --> 30:15.107
What you really see us doing
is broadening the opportunity

30:15.190 --> 30:18.861
for people to participate in,
you know, what is one of the world's,

30:18.944 --> 30:22.155
you know, greatest entertainment
and leisure-time activities.

30:22.239 --> 30:23.615
It's a game-changer because it's bigger

30:23.699 --> 30:26.243
than anything else
we've ever done in gaming.

30:26.326 --> 30:27.744
It's the third largest acquisition

30:27.828 --> 30:30.372
in Microsoft's history,
which still blows my mind.

30:30.455 --> 30:35.878
So now more than ever like
our commitment to games, is absolute.

30:40.048 --> 30:43.051
Microsoft's commitment
to keeping fans on their toes

30:43.135 --> 30:45.345
was also absolute.

30:45.429 --> 30:47.222
Good evening everyone!

30:49.433 --> 30:52.436
Welcome to the Game
Awards 2019, I'm Geoff Keighley.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.023
Ah, world premieres
are a big part of this show,

30:56.356 --> 30:59.401
and you guys have a lot of expectations
on the Internet, for things,

30:59.484 --> 31:01.111
there are lots of rumors, lots of leaks.

31:01.195 --> 31:05.991
It's pretty rare I think nowadays
that any new tech doesn't leak

31:06.074 --> 31:08.035
and like nobody knows that it's coming.

31:08.118 --> 31:12.664
And then sometimes there's surprises
that come out of nowhere.

31:12.748 --> 31:13.874
Enjoy this.

31:16.251 --> 31:18.462
Let's suppose that
you were able every night

31:18.545 --> 31:20.422
to dream any dream you wanted to dream.

31:22.925 --> 31:23.926
A lot of dreams.

31:24.343 --> 31:26.053
And that you could have the power...

31:26.428 --> 31:28.180
I don't think anybody saw it coming.

31:28.263 --> 31:30.307
It was something completely unexpected.

31:32.518 --> 31:33.769
Uh...

31:33.852 --> 31:34.937
Whoa is it Elden Ring?

31:35.395 --> 31:37.397
Even the video was deliberately designed,

31:37.481 --> 31:40.901
talking about power your dreams
and, you know the visuals of that.

31:40.984 --> 31:42.528
Let's have a surprise.

31:42.903 --> 31:45.197
- Bioshock?
And then...

31:45.280 --> 31:47.241
Wait a minute, what was that?

31:48.951 --> 31:50.744
Wait what?

31:51.328 --> 31:54.957
I just saw a car race through,
and then there was like a soccer scene

31:55.040 --> 31:58.126
and then, by the time
I saw Master Chief...

31:58.210 --> 32:01.755
- That's Halo!
- Halo. That's what I want.

32:02.047 --> 32:06.343
And finally you would dream
of where you are now.

32:06.426 --> 32:09.847
And seeing the streamers that were
streaming, and their reactions,

32:10.639 --> 32:14.768
that element of surprise
is so magical and so powerful.

32:15.602 --> 32:16.687
- That's, that...
- Oh, that's Scarlet?

32:16.770 --> 32:18.939
Oh! Oh! yeah!

32:19.022 --> 32:20.941
Xbooooox!

32:21.024 --> 32:22.568
This is not the new Xbox console.

32:22.651 --> 32:24.278
Wait, this is not the new Xbox console,
what...

32:24.361 --> 32:26.405
They're showing their new box?

32:26.488 --> 32:27.656
What the heck!

32:29.449 --> 32:32.494
For 18 years and three generations,

32:32.619 --> 32:36.248
we've designed Xbox consoles
to power your dreams.

32:36.331 --> 32:37.833
Oh, my boy!

32:37.916 --> 32:39.501
You dog.

32:39.585 --> 32:41.211
Meet the Xbox Series X.

32:41.295 --> 32:45.883
It was nuts-o! Because I had no clue
it was coming, and I was there!

32:45.966 --> 32:51.763
Our fastest, most powerful Xbox
will set a new bar for performance.

32:51.847 --> 32:53.849
Games are going to look better.

32:53.932 --> 32:56.393
You know games are going to play better.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.645
It is in fact the most powerful console

32:58.854 --> 33:00.856
you can have
in your living room right now.

33:00.939 --> 33:03.734
Yes! Yes!

33:05.527 --> 33:07.863
When we talk about freedom to play,

33:07.946 --> 33:13.118
Project Scarlet is the formation
of our future in cloud.

33:13.202 --> 33:16.371
Microsoft meanwhile launching
a video-game streaming service.

33:16.455 --> 33:19.917
All your games can be streamed
right into your phone, or your computer.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.377
The same way the original
Xbox bridged the gap

33:22.461 --> 33:26.673
from early adopters with broadband,
this powerful beast of a machine

33:26.757 --> 33:29.760
that can play games locally,
it's also going to connect to the cloud.

33:29.843 --> 33:32.888
So it will bridge the gap
between traditional,

33:32.971 --> 33:35.516
in-the-living-room local gaming
and cloud-based gaming.

33:35.599 --> 33:38.435
We envision a world where you can play

33:38.519 --> 33:42.898
any game with anyone on any device.

33:42.981 --> 33:46.777
It is the next instance
of what it means to game anywhere.

33:47.653 --> 33:51.823
We're streaming from data centers
around the world to people's cell phones.

33:51.907 --> 33:55.327
We have thousands of people doing it,
in three continents.

33:55.410 --> 33:56.578
Like that's just crazy.

33:56.662 --> 33:59.414
And I'll be damned
if it doesn't actually...

33:59.540 --> 34:01.583
I mean, it works. It actually works!

34:02.793 --> 34:03.877
Where are we?

34:06.380 --> 34:07.506
I'm a big believer

34:07.589 --> 34:11.844
in the technology-access story
of Project Xcloud.

34:11.927 --> 34:14.888
Think about the way
you could unlock community.

34:14.972 --> 34:17.432
One of the things that we were
really focused on with this generation

34:17.516 --> 34:20.978
was making Xbox available
and appealing to the widest audience.

34:21.061 --> 34:23.480
I think we have some
unique responsibilities

34:23.564 --> 34:27.693
to bring people from different backgrounds
into the experience,

34:27.776 --> 34:32.990
and in order for us to succeed in that,
we need to have the right services

34:33.073 --> 34:37.536
and content and creators building things
for all kinds of players.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.455
It's about creating an opportunity

34:40.581 --> 34:43.292
for those that would not
have had it otherwise.

34:44.084 --> 34:45.419
2.5 billion people on the planet

34:45.502 --> 34:47.713
play video games today,
half the connected world.

34:48.255 --> 34:53.093
And that is the scale of opportunity
a company like Microsoft should go after.

34:53.343 --> 34:57.681
Being bold and making bets is part of
the culture of what it means to be here.

34:58.015 --> 35:02.853
I think that's true now,
and it was true from the beginning.

35:07.858 --> 35:11.361
- Where are we going?
- Back to where it all began.

35:15.949 --> 35:17.409
You know, we had some guys at Microsoft,

35:17.492 --> 35:19.453
came and said, "We should do a console."

35:19.912 --> 35:21.914
A Microsoft console?

35:23.248 --> 35:26.126
It's insane to launch a game console
when you're Microsoft!

35:26.210 --> 35:28.253
You made frickin' Windows,
and a spreadsheet.

35:29.004 --> 35:31.006
Bill Gates took a bet on us.

35:36.136 --> 35:39.139
Being able to do something
very different and revolutionary,

35:39.515 --> 35:41.642
was where we were getting our energy from.

35:41.850 --> 35:43.560
Are you ready?!

35:44.019 --> 35:46.146
If you think about
where we were 20 years ago,

35:46.230 --> 35:48.440
when I first moved into the games group,

35:48.524 --> 35:51.610
my dad was horrified
because gaming wasn't a career,

35:51.693 --> 35:53.737
and gaming was something that nobody did.

35:55.739 --> 35:57.407
One of the most incredible things

35:57.491 --> 36:01.912
is this turning point
in how gaming is viewed.

36:01.995 --> 36:04.456
That evolution of people
suddenly seeing the value

36:04.540 --> 36:06.667
of the community that comes with gaming.

36:06.792 --> 36:10.420
There's a fundamental change to the way
we think about human interaction.

36:10.504 --> 36:11.505
There he is!

36:11.588 --> 36:13.173
We can have deep, meaningful relationships

36:13.257 --> 36:15.425
with people a world away
that we've never met in person.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.427
11 years of playing together.

36:17.511 --> 36:19.805
11 years, we finally see each other.

36:19.888 --> 36:23.934
Woohoo! Ha ha ha ha ha!

36:24.017 --> 36:27.354
Even in recent history,
you know throughout 2020,

36:27.437 --> 36:33.151
we saw that people recognized this
as a way to have a social experience,

36:33.235 --> 36:35.195
in a time when we had to be distanced.

36:36.238 --> 36:40.325
The pandemic got people to rethink
how they think about video games.

36:40.409 --> 36:43.829
Children can sit and play
Minecraft with friends and build

36:43.912 --> 36:46.290
and create something and connect.

36:46.540 --> 36:49.710
And at the core,
that's what Xbox is about.

36:53.547 --> 36:57.301
As Xbox continues to grow,
I think it's going to continue

36:57.384 --> 36:59.720
to shape the future
of the gaming community.

37:00.679 --> 37:03.640
It goes beyond how many units they sold,

37:03.932 --> 37:08.896
it goes beyond which generation
they won or were dominant in.

37:10.731 --> 37:14.318
I think a company like Microsoft,
we should stand for something more

37:14.401 --> 37:18.113
than just what place we're in,
and I want Xbox to be around forever,

37:18.739 --> 37:20.073
and I want to be able to look back on it

37:20.157 --> 37:25.078
and say we really used this
opportunity to shape culture.

37:29.249 --> 37:31.668
So I'm announcing the Xbox.

37:32.044 --> 37:34.505
The future of console gaming.

37:34.588 --> 37:40.594
A whole new platform that all of you
are going to take in directions

37:40.677 --> 37:44.139
that we can't even imagine,
and the empowerment

37:44.223 --> 37:47.226
that comes out of this
is going to be amazing.

37:48.227 --> 37:49.770
The power of X.
