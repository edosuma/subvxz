Oh, yeah.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.916
Well, I saved up for the down payment

Are you? That's great. I-- Yeah,
I'm gonna be a big writer one day.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.583

- I want to be.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.416

In lady years, I'm a crone,

still be considered sexy at, like, 70,

I'll admit it. It's a good deal.

to bring you anything in New York,

but do you have any herb plants?

02:55.750 --> 02:56.791
What?

02:56.875 --> 02:59.708
You know, herb plants?
Never mind, I'll just pick some up.

You pop them in the windowsill
and then you have fresh basil or mint

03:02.958 --> 03:05.625

or eat it, or just smell it.

03:05.708 --> 03:11.250

soil into my apartment. I'm begging you.

Big shocker, you listen
to The Cars in the morning.

03:13.458 --> 03:16.041
- [chuckles] Morning, noon, and night.
- Oh, I wanted to mention,

03:16.125 --> 03:18.291
when I'm at your place,
if you wanna have somebody over,

03:18.375 --> 03:20.916
and you want me to get out of the way,
I can do that, so you can…

03:21.000 --> 03:22.708
Okay, now I'm feeling uncomfortable.

03:22.791 --> 03:24.625
Oh, please, I've seen you naked.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.041
- Never stops being weird.
- Which is so weird.

I think I can control myself for one week.

someone while you're here

Anyway, no chance of me meeting anybody.

You-- You want my opinion?

04:25.458 --> 04:28.416
Just you saying that,
I know exactly what your opinion is.

04:28.500 --> 04:33.666

but I think Jack could use the space.

Okay, hold on. Here's your present. Look.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.375
I put this in the end table
the night you stayed over,

05:32.458 --> 05:34.791
because, I don't know,
I thought it would be a keepsake

05:34.875 --> 05:38.250
at our wedding or something.
That's how dumb I was in my 20s.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.916
- You weren't dumb.
- I was a little bit dumb.

<i>was when I took all your money!</i>

05:44.166 --> 05:45.541
That was the best part?

05:45.625 --> 05:49.541
I mean, it overshadowed the sex part,
because you fled the next day.

05:49.625 --> 05:52.750
- Wait, hold on. I did call you later.
<i>- Yeah, you did call me later.</i>

05:52.833 --> 05:55.541
When you said
that you couldn't date me or anybody else

05:55.625 --> 05:59.041

"an unknowable piece of shit"?

in me right there.

Yeah, no, I-- I mean with us.

I mean, we've been together
for six months, and…

07:46.208 --> 07:49.833
I just feel like
we're not really getting any closer.

07:49.916 --> 07:52.500
- I mean, I don't know that much about you.
- Yes, you do.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.625

before the end of the year

10:42.375 --> 10:44.958

for that open Senior Accounting position

10:45.041 --> 10:46.416

is only gonna be covered by my insurance

10:56.166 --> 10:58.375

and then it's, like…

10:58.458 --> 11:00.166
- One thousand dollars.

So, no, not a vacay.

to do something nice for yourself.

Thanks.

you're kinda irresponsible.

She does, huh?

32:02.166 --> 32:04.583
Yeah, she also says
you're terrible with women.

Ah. [chuckles] Your mom!

'cause you're chill.

Chill.

- [door closes]

Hi, I'm Debbie.

33:21.708 --> 33:26.500
Wait a second. Are you <i>the</i> Debbie?
Peter talks about you all the time!

33:26.583 --> 33:28.375
- Oh, yeah, I guess that's me.
- [chuckles]

33:28.458 --> 33:29.833
Um, who are you?

33:29.916 --> 33:33.833
I'm Minka, and I am a skosh embarrassed.

33:33.916 --> 33:38.208
I thought Peter was here
and I am not wearing anything under this.

33:38.291 --> 33:41.166
- [Debbie] I figured that.
- Yeah, I feel like an idiot.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.500
Oh, don't worry about it.

33:42.583 --> 33:45.583
We've all done the thing where we knock

33:45.666 --> 33:47.291
So you and Peter are…

33:47.375 --> 33:48.833
We were. We used to.

33:48.916 --> 33:50.375
We broke up after six months

33:50.458 --> 33:52.958
and then he started dating
this woman Becca,

33:53.041 --> 33:54.791
but through the careful study
of her socials,

33:54.875 --> 33:56.500
I figured out they broke up.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.750
So I thought I would come over and…

33:58.833 --> 34:02.791
- So that is how you sit there.
- By the way, where is Peter?

34:02.875 --> 34:04.791
Oh, he's staying at my place in LA.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.041
- And I'm just here for a few days.
- Cute!

34:07.875 --> 34:09.041
Can I buy you a drink?

34:09.541 --> 34:11.083
No ulterior motive.

34:11.166 --> 34:15.791
I will not ask you
why Peter is so emotionally, like, broken.

34:15.875 --> 34:18.583
Oh, I would love that,
but, um, I'm starting classes tomorrow.

34:18.666 --> 34:21.000
I have to get up early.
I'm doing this program, and…

34:21.083 --> 34:23.333
- Anyway, maybe some other time.
- Yeah, sure!

34:23.416 --> 34:26.583
I will take you to the Brownstone Club.
That's where Peter and I met.

34:26.666 --> 34:28.458
You know, you are great.

34:29.291 --> 34:30.500
I like you.

[Peter] <i>You're gonna party with Minka?</i>

to go for a drink sometime.

- Right.

- [Peter] <i>Um…</i>

34:46.250 --> 34:49.833
<i>- What did we do? Um, nothing special.</i>
- Oh, is he there?

34:49.916 --> 34:51.333
- Does he want to talk to me?
- [yells]

34:51.416 --> 34:54.458
Uh, he's-- he's actually doing
his homework right now, so…

34:54.541 --> 34:56.083
[Debbie] <i>Oh! Oh, that's good.</i>

34:56.666 --> 34:59.250
Hey, uh, by the way, are you aware

34:59.333 --> 35:02.125
that there is a gentleman
and his butt crack

35:02.208 --> 35:04.208
in your yard all ding-dong day?

35:04.291 --> 35:08.291
Oh, yeah, that's Zen.
He just-- He's around a lot.

35:08.375 --> 35:11.083
It's, uh-- You know, he does
a really great job with the garden

35:11.166 --> 35:14.791
and-- and so I just let him do his thing.
Um, did I not mention Zen?

35:14.875 --> 35:19.750
Yeah. No, no, you failed to mention
that there is a man living in your yard.

35:19.833 --> 35:23.083
Um, Peter, I just want to say thank you.
This place is amazing.

35:23.166 --> 35:26.833
- It's just comfortable and…
- [chuckles] Really?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.875
- No, not really. It's very, very empty.
- [laughs]

35:29.958 --> 35:31.708
It looks like somebody stole
all your stuff.

35:31.791 --> 35:35.041
Yeah, well, if they did, they brought it
all here, 'cause you have <i>all</i> the stuff.

35:35.125 --> 35:39.416
Like, literally, all the things that are,
were, and ever shall be, are here.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.666
Oh, really? Well, you don't have
a photo or a knickknack.

35:42.750 --> 35:45.458
I don't do knickknacks.
I don't buy them, like, ever.

35:45.541 --> 35:46.958
I have nixed the knickknacks.

35:47.041 --> 35:50.625
Oh, by the way, your books
are all color-coded, which is…

35:50.708 --> 35:53.500
I mean, I knew New York had changed you,
but that one hit me hard.

35:53.583 --> 35:55.041
Yeah, my decorator did that.

35:55.125 --> 35:57.750
That's just gross,
and I can't believe you said it out loud.

35:57.833 --> 36:00.333
Also, you don't have any mementos from LA?

36:00.416 --> 36:03.208
No! You know my policy on mentos.

36:04.291 --> 36:06.125
So, let me ask you a question.

36:06.208 --> 36:09.416
I mean, I'm not trying to pry,
but what happened with Minka?

36:09.500 --> 36:12.583
She seems like she's your type.
She's so silky and sleek.

36:12.666 --> 36:14.208
Okay, what? She's not an otter.

36:14.291 --> 36:16.000
- What happened?
- I don't know. I don't--

36:16.083 --> 36:18.333
You know me.
I probably did something to screw it up.

36:18.416 --> 36:20.041
Oh, stop it.

36:20.666 --> 36:24.500
Yeah, well, let the fossil record show
that I am terrible with women.

36:24.583 --> 36:28.708
In-- In fact, some would say that I am
"a rolling stone that gathers no moss."

36:28.791 --> 36:29.625
Uh, what?

36:29.708 --> 36:32.958
Oh, yeah, just so you know,
your kid's a sieve, all right?

36:33.041 --> 36:35.333
So everything you've ever said about me,
I'm about to hear.

36:35.416 --> 36:37.833
Okay, I didn't--
I didn't say it like that.

36:37.916 --> 36:39.750
- Okay, yeah, I-- I did. I said that.
- Yeah.

36:39.833 --> 36:42.375
- But I think he misunderstood me.
- Yeah, I'm sure. Right, look.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.666
It's getting late out there.
You should go to sleep.

36:44.750 --> 36:47.500
And 'cause I have a list
of things that's a mile long

36:47.583 --> 36:49.750
that was left here for me to do
by a crazy person.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.916
[laughs] "Goodnight,"
said the crazy person.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.875

And I'll see you later on the interwebs.

that she had to be practical,

41:07.416 --> 41:09.000

41:09.083 --> 41:12.666

that she told herself.

- What are-- These aren't seats.

41:54.416 --> 41:56.458
These are tickets to a luxury box.

41:56.541 --> 41:58.375
Isn't that bribing them
to be friends with me?

41:59.041 --> 42:00.916
Ah, and this is
where the rebrand comes in.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.291
So we're gonna rebrand
the word "bribing" with "incentivization."

42:06.208 --> 42:07.291
That's not a word.

42:07.875 --> 42:10.791
In my line of work,
we make up the words that we need.

42:10.875 --> 42:13.041
That's kind of sketch.

42:13.125 --> 42:16.166
Now you're getting it.
There you go, "sketch."

42:17.000 --> 42:20.208
- Look at-- Look at my sketch coffee.
- I really want one of those.

42:21.208 --> 42:24.250
Hey, uh, remember,
I'm gonna pick you up after school.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.625
- We're gonna go to that Kings game. Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

42:26.708 --> 42:30.041
Got it. And we got the big private box
so you can invite whoever you want.

42:30.125 --> 42:32.875
- 'Cause it's the luxury box.
- [Jack] Yeah. See you after school, Peter.

42:32.958 --> 42:35.458
We'll see you after school
when we go to the Kings game!

42:35.541 --> 42:37.583
[Jack, forcefully] Yep, big game!
Let's go!

42:37.666 --> 42:40.125
[Peter] Yeah, with all that candy
and ice cream!

42:40.791 --> 42:43.291
- Hey! Coffee?
- You buying?

42:44.291 --> 42:48.041
Yeah. Oh! Oh, yeah, can we get
one of those, uh… the butter coffees?

42:48.583 --> 42:50.625
- With the butter…
- [sighs] He's miming.

42:51.625 --> 42:52.666
He's miming.

42:54.375 --> 42:55.625
Yes, he is.

42:55.708 --> 42:58.375
- That's actually really good.
- I've been working on it.

Isn't it great?

43:51.916 --> 43:54.666
You know you don't have to take notes.
It's all online.

Oh, I know, but I find if I write it…

- …it goes in my brain…

43:58.916 --> 44:02.083
- Welcome to Statistics in Risk Modeling.
- We'll talk later.

44:02.166 --> 44:04.500
Now, we got a lot to cover.
So let's get started here.

44:05.125 --> 44:06.541
First, we're going to start

44:06.625 --> 44:09.541
by reviewing types
of modeling problems and methods,

44:09.625 --> 44:13.041
including supervised
versus unsupervised learning.

44:13.125 --> 44:14.875
You know, that was a lot of information.

44:14.958 --> 44:16.958
Do you feel like sometime,
we could share notes, or…?

44:17.041 --> 44:18.041
- Hey!
- [woman] Hey.

44:19.416 --> 44:21.708
[man] Oh, my God,
that class was so boring.

44:26.958 --> 44:30.083
- How was your first class?
<i>- It was fine.</i>

44:30.166 --> 44:32.708
Now, that drink we talked about,
you in the mood?

44:32.791 --> 44:34.791
- Yeah, sure!
<i>- Great! I'm right near you.</i>

44:34.875 --> 44:37.541
So, I'll come pick you up.
See you soon! Bye!

44:39.125 --> 44:44.750
In this literature class,
prepare yourself to do a lot of reading.

44:45.625 --> 44:49.458
We're gonna be tackling some big novels,
I'm talking about the chunky ones.

44:49.541 --> 44:51.666
I'm talking some real door-stoppers.

44:51.750 --> 44:54.250
In this class,
<i>Anna Karenina</i> is a pamphlet.

44:54.333 --> 44:55.791

44:55.875 --> 44:59.458

a massive book with tiny, tiny print.

Oh, hey, Miss Backpack! You ready?

- [chuckles] That was fast.
- Cute college.

[Debbie] Right?

45:26.458 --> 45:28.666
I mean, I'm personally allergic to school.

45:28.750 --> 45:31.125
After I got the master's
in differential calculus,

45:31.208 --> 45:34.000
I was like, "Enough!"
You know? Okay, follow me.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.750
Did you say differential calculus?

45:36.833 --> 45:38.666
- [horn blows]
- [crowd cheering]

45:40.833 --> 45:43.625
[Wade] So funny. You ran, like,
right into the practice station.

45:43.708 --> 45:46.541
Dude, it's not my fault
the lace on my right skate snapped!

45:46.625 --> 45:47.625
Whoa! Look at these!

45:47.708 --> 45:51.666
- Dude! Jelly beans.
- I love those! Those are my favorite!

45:51.750 --> 45:54.000
Dude, I think this is
the cinnamon one that's super spicy.

45:54.083 --> 45:56.041
- Really?
- You ever had the cinnamon Jolly Rancher?

45:56.125 --> 45:57.208
- The spicy one?
- Yeah.

45:57.291 --> 46:00.583
Oh! I love those cinnamon… spicy ones!

46:00.666 --> 46:03.916
That's so spicy. I'm good.
I don't really like those ones.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.041
Hey, hey, none of this stuff
is on the allergy list,

46:07.125 --> 46:08.291
so you're good to go.

46:08.375 --> 46:10.416
So just go nuts, have at it.

46:10.500 --> 46:13.416
- Without eating any nuts.
- [Wade] I think that's actually licorice.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.958
[Jack] Why aren't they talking to me?

46:15.041 --> 46:16.500
- [boys] Dots!
- [Peter] They will!

46:16.583 --> 46:18.791
They will. Don't worry about it. Let's go.

46:18.875 --> 46:22.750
We'll, hey, get a jersey or something.
Let's get our kit on. Let's go. Go, Kings!

[Minka] <i>Okay, I need a drink.</i>

46:24.375 --> 46:26.583
[Debbie] Oh, yes. Let's have a drink!

46:26.666 --> 46:29.083
- [Minka] For one, I'm so thirsty.
- I know!

46:29.166 --> 46:30.041
[Minka] Ooh!

46:30.541 --> 46:31.375
Okay.

46:33.083 --> 46:35.625
[Debbie] Wait a second.
The-- These people look really fancy.

46:35.708 --> 46:38.625
[Minka] Yeah, you have to be someone
or know someone, and I'm both.

46:38.708 --> 46:41.333
And also kind of neither.
That's what's great about me.

46:42.333 --> 46:43.333
Oh, wow.

46:43.416 --> 46:45.625
Uh, I don't think I fit in here.

46:46.291 --> 46:49.000
I mean, obviously.
But you're with me. Come on.

46:50.208 --> 46:51.750
Thank you, Petra!

46:51.833 --> 46:53.791
[lively pop music plays faintly]

46:54.583 --> 46:57.291
By the way, we do not
have to talk about Peter.

46:57.375 --> 46:59.375
[Debbie] Oh, okay. Got it.

47:00.166 --> 47:02.000
[crowd cheering]

47:03.375 --> 47:04.666
Honestly, bro.

47:04.750 --> 47:05.833
- Yeah!
- I mean, he had it--

47:05.916 --> 47:07.416
- He had it at the start, right?
- Dude!

47:07.500 --> 47:09.291
- He literally had it--
- Guys, guys!

47:09.375 --> 47:11.125
Did you see that last rally?

47:11.625 --> 47:13.208
That was crazy, huh?

47:13.291 --> 47:15.333
That was, like-- That was sketch!

47:15.416 --> 47:17.625
Or as the Canadians would say,
that was sketch, eh?

47:17.708 --> 47:19.000
What is he talking about?

47:20.916 --> 47:23.916
- [Minka] Just be conscious of--
- [server] All right.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.666
Manhattan Maiden for you.

47:25.750 --> 47:26.708
Ooh!

47:26.791 --> 47:29.166
And the Garden Glory for you.

47:29.666 --> 47:30.541
Oh.

47:31.625 --> 47:33.333
- Enjoy!
- Thank you. [chuckles]

47:33.416 --> 47:35.458
Am I supposed to drink it or water it?

47:35.541 --> 47:37.375
So how did you and Peter meet again?

47:37.458 --> 47:39.333
Is this the part
where we don't talk about Peter?

47:39.416 --> 47:40.708
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

47:40.791 --> 47:41.875
[Minka] This is that part.

47:41.958 --> 47:44.833
Well, short story, we hooked up once,

47:44.916 --> 47:47.083
and then he bailed, and we became friends.

47:47.625 --> 47:49.583
And you married someone else.

47:49.666 --> 47:53.000
- Mm, Jimmy the mountain climber.
- [Minka] Mm.

47:53.083 --> 47:57.041
Which is funny, 'cause at the time,
he felt like a safe choice for me.

47:57.125 --> 47:59.041
- Mm.
- He was just very sure about me.

47:59.125 --> 48:00.125
Mmm.

48:00.208 --> 48:03.041
But, ultimately,
he wanted to go on big adventures,

48:03.125 --> 48:06.375
and my adventures
are reading books and being a mom.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.375
So, we realized he needed somebody
who always wanted to be by his side

48:10.458 --> 48:12.000
and that just wasn't gonna be me.

48:12.833 --> 48:14.291
And your love life now?

48:15.458 --> 48:16.666
Sort of like…

48:17.666 --> 48:20.583
wind on an open prairie, or…

48:21.583 --> 48:23.833
footsteps in an empty attic,

48:24.333 --> 48:25.666
or what are those…

48:26.583 --> 48:30.375
Tumbleweeds going through
an old ghost town. Sort of like that.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.750
Okay, we need to get on that.

48:33.375 --> 48:35.250
Well, good luck. It's been a minute.

48:35.333 --> 48:37.625

48:37.708 --> 48:38.791
Oh, I know that guy.

48:38.875 --> 48:41.208
He's a professor at my school,
the guy with the bow tie.

48:41.708 --> 48:44.500
- Wow, the guy he is sitting with is…
- [Debbie] Oh, my God.

48:44.583 --> 48:46.791
I know. He is <i>fuego.</i>

48:46.875 --> 48:49.708
Oh, no, yes, that--
And that's, uh, Theo Martin.

48:49.791 --> 48:52.041
He's the editor of Duncan Press.

48:52.125 --> 48:53.041
[Minka] Mmm.

48:53.125 --> 48:55.625
They publish
the best contemporary fiction on earth.

48:55.708 --> 48:58.375
Mmm, yeah.
I only listen to celebrity bios.

48:58.458 --> 49:00.958
The Rob Lowe one is my favorite.
The first one, of course.

49:01.041 --> 49:02.916
Theo Martin is so famous.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.291
Also, he's yummy,
and he's sitting with someone you know.

49:06.375 --> 49:08.416
- He's very attractive, that's true.
- So, come on.

49:08.500 --> 49:12.041
Wait, where you going? Oh, oh… okay.
Maybe I should bring my plant.

49:12.125 --> 49:13.875

49:13.958 --> 49:17.208
- It's true. You know, ambitious.
- Hi! Sorry to barge over.

49:17.291 --> 49:18.958
But we saw you from over there--

49:19.041 --> 49:21.375
Hold on, you! You were in my class.

49:21.458 --> 49:24.166
- You came over and I saw… Yeah, hi.
- Yeah! That was me.

I never forget a denim skirt.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.500

49:27.583 --> 49:31.416
Cute! That's a really cool story!
I'm Minka. This is Debbie. You are?

49:31.500 --> 49:34.125
- Theo Martin from Duncan Press.
- Yes.

49:34.208 --> 49:36.916
I recognized you.
I've read every Duncan Press book.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.333
Wow. Well, not every book.
I mean, no way. [laughs]

49:39.416 --> 49:40.541
Yes, way!

49:41.125 --> 49:44.916
Okay, 870-page tome
set on a pirate ship in the South Pacific?

49:45.000 --> 49:47.708
<i>Hobart's Horizon.</i>
I read it in two days. Ahoy!

[all laugh]

49:49.166 --> 49:51.625
All right, spy novel set in Crete.

49:51.708 --> 49:53.875
Oh, <i>Ocean of Lies!</i>
I mean, one of the best!

49:53.958 --> 49:57.000
I kept saying for a week,
<i>"Eímai katáskopos!"</i>

49:57.083 --> 49:59.250
- [laughs]
- [Minka] Sorry?

49:59.333 --> 50:01.458
- That's, um, Greek for "I am a spy."
- "I am a spy."

50:01.541 --> 50:03.458
- Sure.
- All right, I got it, I got it.

50:03.541 --> 50:06.500
You did not read the Dust Bowl book,
because no one read the Dust Bowl book.

50:06.583 --> 50:09.625
<i>Where The Rattlesnake Sings.</i>
I-- I bought it the day it came out.

50:09.708 --> 50:13.083
That was you? I'm pretty sure
we only sold the one copy.

50:13.166 --> 50:14.458
That was me! I bought it!

50:14.541 --> 50:16.583
[laughs]

50:17.708 --> 50:18.916
- [Theo] Wow.
- Anyway, yeah.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.500
[Theo] S-- So many vegetables.

50:20.583 --> 50:22.083
Oh, I know, isn't this crazy?

50:22.166 --> 50:25.750
I even said, "Oh, what? Should I get
some dip with my crudité platter?"

50:25.833 --> 50:26.666
[chuckles]

50:27.916 --> 50:30.958
- [Minka] It was so nice to meet you both!
- [Theo] Yeah, you too.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.250
Can I get your number, actually?

50:34.333 --> 50:37.333
I occasionally have galleys
to give away, signed ones even.

50:37.416 --> 50:39.416
[gasps] I would love that!

50:41.166 --> 50:42.208
[Minka] Oh, my God.

50:43.750 --> 50:44.625
[phone clicks]

50:44.708 --> 50:46.458
Here, put in your number.

50:46.541 --> 50:47.458
[Theo] Ah.

50:52.333 --> 50:53.333
Okay.

50:54.041 --> 50:55.666
- Okay! Ciao, boys!
- Ciao.

50:55.750 --> 50:58.541
- [professor] We're gonna go this way.
- OMG, he is into you!

50:58.625 --> 51:01.666
- No, he's not.
- Uh, okay.

51:01.750 --> 51:03.625
- He's being nice.
- No, he's not.

51:03.708 --> 51:06.041
That is what "into you" looks like.

51:06.125 --> 51:07.791
[Debbie] Oh, please!

51:08.875 --> 51:13.500
It's cute how you like the book people,
and how you and Peter actually read books.

51:13.583 --> 51:14.916
- [sighs]
- It's very cute.

51:15.416 --> 51:17.708
[Debbie] Yeah,
we always had that in common.

51:17.791 --> 51:20.083
We were just two
old-fashioned book lovers.

51:20.166 --> 51:21.541
Yeah, sure.

51:21.625 --> 51:23.750
And, well, there's the book he wrote.

51:24.500 --> 51:27.125
- What book?
- Novel, big thing, massive.

51:27.208 --> 51:28.500
[chuckles] What? No.

51:28.583 --> 51:31.291
[mock chuckles] "What?" Yeah.

51:32.375 --> 51:33.583
I don't believe you.

51:33.666 --> 51:35.666
I'm telling you,
he wrote a whole big fat book.

51:35.750 --> 51:37.583
Keeps it in an envelope in his oven.

51:37.666 --> 51:39.958
I found it once
when I was trying to bake keto brownies,

51:40.041 --> 51:41.875
which, by the way, do not recommend.

51:41.958 --> 51:44.125

There's zucchini in the recipe.

51:44.208 --> 51:47.250
Peter used to want to be a writer,
but he quit when he moved here.

51:47.333 --> 51:48.791
He-- He doesn't write anymore.

51:48.875 --> 51:51.666
Uh-huh. Except for the part where…

51:55.083 --> 51:56.125
he does.

52:02.041 --> 52:02.958
Open it.

52:09.041 --> 52:12.166
<i>The Boy</i> by P. Coleman. Peter!

52:12.250 --> 52:14.833
Wow. You're good at detective-y things.

52:14.916 --> 52:15.916
Hold on.

52:17.291 --> 52:20.708
Peter wrote a whole novel
and never mentioned it to me?

52:20.791 --> 52:21.875
You should read it.

52:21.958 --> 52:24.083
I didn't read it because it's a book.

52:24.166 --> 52:25.375
Oh, no, I-- I can't read it.

52:25.458 --> 52:27.416
If-- If he wanted me to read it,
he would have told me,

52:27.500 --> 52:29.250
because we tell each other everything.

52:29.333 --> 52:31.708
I mean, obviously, you don't.

52:32.833 --> 52:33.666
But we do.

52:34.541 --> 52:35.375
Okay.

52:36.375 --> 52:39.541
See, that's the thing.
We tell each other… everything.

52:39.625 --> 52:40.583
Mmm.

52:41.583 --> 52:42.583
"Everything."

52:44.583 --> 52:47.083
[Peter] All right,
this is a minor setback, right?

52:47.166 --> 52:49.416
This happens all the time
at the beginning of a project.

52:49.500 --> 52:53.291
What we need to do is pivot, okay?
We're gonna stay with the same approach--

52:53.375 --> 52:54.458
I don't want to talk.

53:05.375 --> 53:06.375
Hey.

53:09.166 --> 53:10.083
I'm sorry.

53:11.875 --> 53:12.791
That sucked.

53:14.666 --> 53:16.500
My problem-solving skills are…

53:17.541 --> 53:20.500
I guess, more pertain
to the business world.

53:21.416 --> 53:24.416

- Good, good.

Uh, no. You know what?
It sounds echo-y there.

- Are you in the bathtub?
- No! I don't take baths.

54:25.208 --> 54:26.583
I don't even get baths.

54:26.666 --> 54:27.500
Right, right.

each other everything, right?

54:32.166 --> 54:33.166
- No.
- What?

54:35.250 --> 54:36.583
I took Jack to the hockey game

54:36.666 --> 54:39.333
without asking you first, and he brought
his friends Wade and Evan.

54:39.416 --> 54:41.208
You got Wade and Evan
to hang out with Jack?

54:41.291 --> 54:45.458
Yes. I-- Yeah, yes.
And-- And he ate pizza.

54:45.541 --> 54:48.375
It was gluten-free pizza,
but pizza all the same.

54:48.458 --> 54:50.333
- Okay, Peter, I--
- I-- I'm not done.

54:53.041 --> 54:55.291
We're not gonna eat
your casseroles, Debbie.

54:55.375 --> 54:57.541
Uh, ever. They're gross.

54:57.625 --> 55:00.375
Okay, thank you.
That's a refreshing amount of honesty.

55:00.458 --> 55:01.958

55:02.041 --> 55:04.083
I got it all out. That's it.

Look, you don't have to report
everything to me. I trust you.

55:07.833 --> 55:09.250
- You do?
- Mostly.

55:09.333 --> 55:11.666
- And you trust me, right?
- [chuckles] Of course.

55:11.750 --> 55:15.791
So, if you ever wanted to tell me
about anything, you could, right?

55:15.875 --> 55:17.583
Tell you? About what?

55:17.666 --> 55:19.666
I mean, I don't know.

55:19.750 --> 55:23.583
- Like, if you have a special project.
- You want to hear about my projects?

55:23.666 --> 55:25.666
My point is, you can tell me anything.

55:25.750 --> 55:27.500
Which is what I do, like, always.

55:27.583 --> 55:30.791

1:02:49.916 --> 1:02:53.083
Oh, hi. Uh, I'm looking for Theo Martin.

1:02:53.166 --> 1:02:54.166
Mmm.

1:02:54.250 --> 1:02:55.208
Oh, sorry.

1:02:55.833 --> 1:02:59.541
- Cute.
- Oh, my God. Look at those book covers.

1:02:59.625 --> 1:03:02.208
Oh, there you are. Welcome. Hello, Minka.

1:03:02.958 --> 1:03:03.875
Theo.

1:03:03.958 --> 1:03:05.250
- Debbie.
- Hi!

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:08.000
Sorry to have you run uptown
without much notice,

1:03:08.083 --> 1:03:11.541
but this book, I mean, it is…
It has a lot of promise.

1:03:11.625 --> 1:03:13.958
Oh, my God. Did you read
the whole thing already?

1:03:14.041 --> 1:03:15.625
That's, like, a shit ton of pages!

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:17.041
Well, my assistant did.

1:03:17.125 --> 1:03:19.125
She thought it had potential,
and passed it on to me,

1:03:19.208 --> 1:03:20.833
and I gotta say, I-- I agree.

1:03:21.791 --> 1:03:22.666
Wow. [gasps]

1:03:22.750 --> 1:03:25.083
I also see why you cried.
I may have shed a tear myself.

1:03:25.166 --> 1:03:26.208
The dad, right?

1:03:26.291 --> 1:03:30.125
[chuckles] Especially, yeah.
I mean, look, I'm very interested.

1:03:32.791 --> 1:03:33.750
And I would--

1:03:33.833 --> 1:03:36.875
I would really like to speak
to the author as soon as possible.

1:03:36.958 --> 1:03:39.458
The author. You know, can I, um…

1:03:39.541 --> 1:03:42.416
I had a really big coffee on the way here.
I just need to tinkle.

1:03:43.375 --> 1:03:46.083
Sure, yeah. Most of the tinkling
happens right down the hall.

1:03:46.166 --> 1:03:47.333
Okay.

1:03:48.625 --> 1:03:51.875
- This is insane!
- I know, this place is so old school.

1:03:52.458 --> 1:03:54.041
I smell dead people.

1:03:54.125 --> 1:03:55.666
No, no, no! What am I doing?

1:03:55.750 --> 1:03:59.000
I'm acting crazy!
I know I like to help friends out,

1:03:59.083 --> 1:04:02.291
but that normally means
picking up Alicia's twins at carpool.

1:04:02.375 --> 1:04:04.291
I have to just call Peter,
and put a hold on this.

1:04:04.375 --> 1:04:05.250
Ew, no.

1:04:05.333 --> 1:04:06.291
No?

1:04:06.375 --> 1:04:10.375
You believe in Peter's book,
so why not see this through?

1:04:10.458 --> 1:04:11.666
So, just…

1:04:13.833 --> 1:04:15.666
Yeah! You got this, girl!

1:04:15.750 --> 1:04:17.291
Okay. Okay, okay.

1:04:17.375 --> 1:04:19.291
Also, no, I actually do have to pee.

1:04:21.791 --> 1:04:24.666
Theo, I would like
to discuss the next steps.

1:04:25.875 --> 1:04:28.291
Sure. You free for dinner?

1:04:29.625 --> 1:04:30.458
Uh…

1:04:31.708 --> 1:04:32.833
Uh, yes.

1:04:32.916 --> 1:04:34.208
Yes! Sure.

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:35.833
Perfect.

1:04:36.666 --> 1:04:38.250
Perfect. [sighs]

1:04:38.333 --> 1:04:39.333
Perfect!

1:04:46.333 --> 1:04:48.250
- Uh, is that the coach?
- Yeah, that's him.

1:04:48.333 --> 1:04:50.666
All right, you stay here.
Let me do my thing.

1:04:50.750 --> 1:04:52.458
[hopeful music playing]

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:55.625
[imperceptible]

1:05:10.166 --> 1:05:12.000
- Say hey to your coach.
- [Jack] Hey.

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:25.291
- You got-- One of these yours? Yeah?
- Uh, yeah.

1:05:25.375 --> 1:05:27.916
- That's him.
- Oh, Weasel F-- Ev-- Evan!

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.666
- That's him, yeah.
- Yeah, he's… Yup.

1:05:33.916 --> 1:05:35.125
That's it, J-- You're good!

1:05:35.208 --> 1:05:36.583
[coach] Are you ready?

1:05:37.333 --> 1:05:41.000
Oh! That's it! Yep!
Yep, that's my guy! That's him.

1:05:41.083 --> 1:05:42.958
- [woman] That's great.
- That's my guy.

1:05:43.041 --> 1:05:44.208
[doorbell rings]

1:05:45.375 --> 1:05:47.916
[panting] I thought black was best,

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.291
since you are a bright winter.

1:05:51.375 --> 1:05:52.791
Oh, I-- I don't need a new outfit.

1:05:52.875 --> 1:05:54.250
[laughs] Aww!

1:05:54.333 --> 1:05:56.458
[sighs] I feel terrible.
I'm about to tell a guy,

1:05:56.541 --> 1:05:59.041
who's the most famous literary editor
in all of America,

1:05:59.125 --> 1:06:02.041
that I gave him a manuscript
that he might want to publish,

1:06:02.125 --> 1:06:05.125
but he possibly cannot.
And why isn't Peter calling me back?

1:06:05.208 --> 1:06:07.083
If you can't reach Peter
before your date with Theo--

1:06:07.166 --> 1:06:08.708
No, no, no, it's not a date.

1:06:09.583 --> 1:06:11.000
- Let me have this!
- Okay.

1:06:11.083 --> 1:06:13.833
I mean, I can't even stay out that late.
I have an exam tomorrow.

1:06:13.916 --> 1:06:15.625
Shh. Try a dress on.

1:06:15.708 --> 1:06:17.625
I'm sorry, I'm just worried
about Peter and Jack.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:19.208
- Where are they?
- Try one on!

1:06:19.291 --> 1:06:21.416
[breath trembling]

1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:22.333
Please.

1:06:24.041 --> 1:06:26.708
[Peter] You are by far
the fastest guy out there.

1:06:26.791 --> 1:06:29.375
New nickname, Jack Frost,
'cause you own the ice!

1:06:29.458 --> 1:06:30.958
- 'Sup, fellas!
- What's up, man?

1:06:31.041 --> 1:06:32.708
- Great day?
- Great day, brah.

1:06:33.333 --> 1:06:34.833
- Yes, I love that!
- Great day.

1:06:36.333 --> 1:06:38.875
So, you ever gonna have kids?

1:06:39.833 --> 1:06:41.666
What? I don't know.

1:06:43.291 --> 1:06:44.250
Should I?

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.833
I mean… you're not terrible at it.

1:06:49.916 --> 1:06:51.750
A little weird, but you don't suck.

1:06:53.958 --> 1:06:54.791
I don't?

1:06:55.458 --> 1:06:56.291
No.

1:06:57.166 --> 1:07:00.000
Well, I should probably start my homework.

1:07:02.041 --> 1:07:02.875
See ya.

1:07:05.666 --> 1:07:06.583
[chuckles softly]

1:07:13.541 --> 1:07:14.708
[Peter] Oh! [sighs]

1:07:15.833 --> 1:07:16.666
Hey-o.

1:07:18.083 --> 1:07:18.916
Oh, for me?

1:07:19.666 --> 1:07:21.416
Yeah. Come on, take a break.

1:07:22.208 --> 1:07:24.291
Well, I don't-- I don't need a break.

1:07:24.375 --> 1:07:25.750
I don't work here, so…

1:07:25.833 --> 1:07:26.916
Yeah, I know.

1:07:27.958 --> 1:07:29.166
[both chuckle]

1:07:29.750 --> 1:07:31.416
Oh. All right.

1:07:31.500 --> 1:07:33.041
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

1:07:33.125 --> 1:07:33.958
Yeah.

1:07:34.666 --> 1:07:36.583
[both breathe loudly]

1:07:36.666 --> 1:07:37.500
[Peter] Mmm.

1:07:37.583 --> 1:07:40.291
You know, I thought you didn't like me.

1:07:40.375 --> 1:07:42.958
Why? [laughs]
Because I've been such a jerk to you?

1:07:43.541 --> 1:07:44.833
Yeah, that.

1:07:44.916 --> 1:07:46.708
Ah, look, I'm sorry.

1:07:47.208 --> 1:07:50.458
I-- I think I've just been stressed out
being responsible for a human.

1:07:50.541 --> 1:07:53.541
[chuckles] You know,
I've never even taken care of, like, a…

1:07:53.625 --> 1:07:55.000
herb plant before.

1:07:55.083 --> 1:07:58.125
Well, dude, herb plants
can be as hard as children.

1:07:58.208 --> 1:08:02.333
Yeah, I got--
I got a sage over by the patio,

1:08:02.416 --> 1:08:04.333
kept me up till 3:00 a.m. last week.

1:08:04.416 --> 1:08:06.375
I call it "plant colic."

1:08:06.458 --> 1:08:08.916
So, you know, I get it.

1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.083
Yeah, no, you get it.

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.416
- Same damn thing.
- Yup.

1:08:14.333 --> 1:08:19.375
Yeah, actually, I feel like
I'm, uh, doing an okay job now.

1:08:19.458 --> 1:08:20.958
Ah, that's dope, brah.

1:08:21.625 --> 1:08:22.458
Hmm.

1:08:23.083 --> 1:08:26.833
And so I'm sorry if I wasn't
as friendly as I could have been.

1:08:26.916 --> 1:08:28.625
Right? 'Cause I'm-- Hey, I, actually--

1:08:28.708 --> 1:08:31.625
I think Debbie's really lucky
to have you 'round here helping out.

1:08:31.708 --> 1:08:34.208
Oh, no, no, no. I'm the lucky one, okay?

1:08:34.291 --> 1:08:35.625
I mean, she is…

1:08:36.166 --> 1:08:37.916
[sighs and chuckles]

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:39.750
…amazing, you know?

1:08:39.833 --> 1:08:41.833
Yeah. Yeah, she really is.

1:08:41.916 --> 1:08:45.375
I mean, we've been friends
for a long time.

1:08:46.166 --> 1:08:48.458
I mean, not as long
as she and I have been friends, so…

1:08:48.541 --> 1:08:51.041
- Oh, no. Well, of course, I'm not--
- In years.

1:08:51.125 --> 1:08:52.083
Right. Look.

1:08:52.791 --> 1:08:56.833
You and Debbie, you have your thing,
which is different from our thing.

1:08:56.916 --> 1:09:00.041
- Your thing. Yeah.
- Right! Like, you're her friend.

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.208
I'm her neighbor
and, like, part-time lover, you know?

1:09:06.125 --> 1:09:07.916
- What was that?
- Oh, you know what?

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.458
You probably haven't noticed this
because you guys are just friends, but…

1:09:11.958 --> 1:09:16.708
brodiddly, she is pretty hot.

1:09:16.791 --> 1:09:18.083
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

1:09:18.166 --> 1:09:20.833
I mean, I know, I know,
she's out of my league. I got it.

1:09:20.916 --> 1:09:22.958
But I have a plan.

1:09:24.125 --> 1:09:25.708
Okay? My thing is…

1:09:27.458 --> 1:09:30.208
I just keep showing up
in her life, you know?

1:09:30.291 --> 1:09:34.583
And then maybe, <i>maybe,</i>
she'll change her mind about me.

1:09:34.666 --> 1:09:35.916
You know what I mean?

1:09:36.750 --> 1:09:40.125
In the meantime,
I'll take friends with benefits.

- Oh, isn't it amazing?
- [sighs happily]

1:10:10.791 --> 1:10:12.916
It reminded me of <i>As I Lay Dying.</i>

1:10:13.750 --> 1:10:15.625
- Faulkner? Really?
- Mmm.

1:10:15.708 --> 1:10:17.916
Yeah, I was thinking more Franzen.

1:10:18.666 --> 1:10:20.750
Oh, I see that. The-- The family dynamics?

1:10:20.833 --> 1:10:22.416
- Yeah, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:24.958
I mean, you really--
You really found a gem.

1:10:26.166 --> 1:10:27.208
I think I did.

1:10:28.416 --> 1:10:30.916
The book that I have read the most
is <i>House of Mirth.</i>

1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:34.708
Oh, Edith Wharton.
Very underrated social critic, I must say.

1:10:34.791 --> 1:10:36.250
- Scathing.
- Do you like her work?

1:10:36.333 --> 1:10:37.166
Of course!

1:10:37.250 --> 1:10:40.375
Look, anybody who doesn't love Edie Dubs
just hasn't really read Edie Dubs.

1:10:40.458 --> 1:10:44.291
[laughs] And I cry my eyes out
every time Lily Bart dies.

1:10:44.375 --> 1:10:46.000
Oh, I know!
And then poor Lawrence shows up

1:10:46.083 --> 1:10:48.041
the next morning to propose.
Like, buddy, come on!

1:10:48.125 --> 1:10:49.250
It's just a little bit late.

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:52.625
I took all that sleeping potion stuff
last night and I am super dead!

1:10:52.708 --> 1:10:54.916
Yeah, sorry, but I have perished, <i>mon ami.</i>

1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.208
[sighs] But looked gorgeous doing it.

1:10:57.291 --> 1:10:58.875
[Debbie laughs]

1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.250
Do you know what Walt Whitman
said about the Brooklyn Bridge?

1:11:05.333 --> 1:11:06.208
No, tell me.

1:11:06.791 --> 1:11:10.625
He said, "It was the best
and most effective medicine

1:11:10.708 --> 1:11:12.708
my soul has yet partaken."

1:11:13.375 --> 1:11:14.791
That's a really great quote.

1:11:16.791 --> 1:11:18.833
Sadly, that's the Manhattan Bridge.

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:22.958
Good quote, though.

1:11:24.083 --> 1:11:26.916
- And I-- I knew that.
- I figured. I thought you did.

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.375
- I just wanted to see if you knew that.
- Right, right.

1:11:29.458 --> 1:11:32.541
- So, clearly you're very smart.
- Yeah. This is, I must say, going well.

1:11:32.625 --> 1:11:34.958
- [Debbie] It was a test!
- Did I pass?

1:11:35.041 --> 1:11:35.916
[Debbie] Yes!

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.333
Well, I'm-- I'm gonna talk
to the writer about that manuscript.

1:11:39.416 --> 1:11:41.375
Oh, perfect. Great!

1:11:41.458 --> 1:11:42.541
- Yeah.
- I was gonna…

1:11:43.250 --> 1:11:44.416
So, um…

1:11:45.541 --> 1:11:47.500
And, um, I can't--
I forgot whether or not you…

1:11:47.583 --> 1:11:49.958
Did you have a cappuccino
at the restaurant?

1:11:50.041 --> 1:11:52.916
Oh, yeah. Yes, you ordered it for me.

1:11:53.500 --> 1:11:54.791
- Oh, okay!
- [both laugh]

1:11:54.875 --> 1:11:55.958
Yeah.

1:11:56.041 --> 1:11:59.416
Um, this is the part where…
This is the part, right?

1:11:59.500 --> 1:12:00.750
- I think so.
- Okay.

1:12:00.833 --> 1:12:02.541
- Let's… Yeah.
- [elevator bell rings]
