01:08.068 --> 01:10.912
What would home look like?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
I don't know.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.962
A farmhouse in the valley,
I guess,

01:19.121 --> 01:22.591
like the one we grew up in,
Liza and I.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.434
I remember hiding
in the orchard at night

01:36.597 --> 01:39.601
looking down
at the lighted windows,

01:39.766 --> 01:41.564
waiting for our daddy
to fall asleep

01:41.727 --> 01:44.731
just so we could
go back inside.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.864
Do you remember that, Liza?

01:48.275 --> 01:51.495
Hmm?
Do you remember that?

01:51.653 --> 01:52.996
I'd imagine him passing out

01:53.155 --> 01:55.533
with one of his
Lucky Strikes in his hand,

01:55.699 --> 01:58.327
the house catching fire,

01:58.493 --> 02:02.498
the orchard,
the whole valley burning up.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.633
So, how's it feel, Liza?
Your first big score?

02:09.795 --> 02:11.218
I don't know.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.635
Excited, nervous,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.145
like I'm spying on someone,

02:17.304 --> 02:18.647
someone doing something dirty.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.605
Yeah, I know what you mean.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.520
Shame.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.484
It's all right, little sis.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.820
It's a good sign
when you feel a little bad.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.563
Liza?

03:00.722 --> 03:03.191
Liza, can you hear me?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.523
- Liza?
- I can hear you.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.814
Are you in pain?

03:07.979 --> 03:10.823
No. I think
I'm all right.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.984
Theo?

03:13.151 --> 03:15.529
Theo should've worn
his safety belt.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.243
Shit.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.737
- Radio 234, TA on Highway 131.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.585
Liza, can you move?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.091
I think so.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.422
- Then be ready to.
- Okay.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.430
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

04:19.593 --> 04:22.267
Sir, I hope you can forgive me.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.813
Addison?

04:31.980 --> 04:35.405
Liza, get the money.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.362
Liza, now!

04:54.961 --> 04:57.885
See if you can get to your bag.
Get anything warm.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.676
I'm sure that officer called for backup,
at least an ambulance.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.220
We can't be foolish now,
you understand?

05:03.386 --> 05:06.811
- Do you have the money?
- Mm-hmm. Most of it.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.522
- Do you have your health?
- I think so.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.062
Let's not dally.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.710
Mills! Let's go.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.299
Pack it up.
You're out of here.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.556
Yo, you be cool,
white boy.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.342
- Yeah.
- You be cool out there, man.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.477
- Yeah!
- Come on, keep going!

05:47.514 --> 05:48.811
You got your papers?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.351
You know how to get
your car out of impound?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.144
I'm okay.
Thanks.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.278
Going home to see your folks
for Thanksgiving?

05:54.437 --> 05:56.110
I don't know.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.651
- Just let me out of here.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.648
Hello?

06:37.355 --> 06:39.357
Hello?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.401
Dad, it's Jay.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.289
Dad, are you there?

06:46.448 --> 06:48.291
Hello, son.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.962
How you been?

06:54.956 --> 06:57.129
Decent.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.932
Listen, I'm in the middle
of something.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.092
I'll get your mother.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.186
Who is it?

07:13.892 --> 07:15.189
Hello?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.195
Mom, it's me.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.699
Oh! Oh, my goodness.
Hi, honey!

07:20.857 --> 07:22.780
How are you?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.286
I'm out.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.618
- What?
- This morning. Good behavior.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.536
Oh, <i>my</i> God.
That's wonderful.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.124
Then you'll be here
for Thanksgiving tomorrow?

07:34.287 --> 07:38.588
Oh! I'll make it nice, honey,
just the way it used to be.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.465
What about Dad?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.761
Your father loves you, Jay.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.931
He just has a hard time
showing it.

07:52.097 --> 07:55.067
Listen, if it's more
comfortable tomorrow morning,

07:55.225 --> 07:56.351
he'll be gone hunting.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.486
We can talk about it then.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.489
I just need the keys
to the cottage, if that's okay.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.867
Oh, sure. They're here.
Just come and get them.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.446
Do you need money?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.034
Are you in trouble?

08:09.197 --> 08:11.450
Mom, I've got to go.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.855
Read the sign!

08:47.944 --> 08:50.038
Oh, shit.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.823
Jay.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.333
"Mohawk" Mills.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.368
Jay.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.003
Just Jay.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.711
Time really flies by.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.422
It didn't fly by for me.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.212
Well, come on in, kid.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.678
Just watching some tape
on a new fighter.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.140
Yeah, you were
really something then.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.065
No one threw
a left hook harder.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.146
You weren't even there, Ronnie.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.778
How'd you end up with my medal?

09:21.936 --> 09:24.655
I just figured
I'd hang on to it,

09:24.814 --> 09:26.862
you know, for safekeeping.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.527
Right.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.333
Looks good on you, kid.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.997
- When did you get out?
- Couple of hours ago.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.212
Wow, you came straight here.
I'm honored.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.297
Who tipped off the boxing
commission, Ronnie?

09:45.460 --> 09:47.178
Hell if I know.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.511
Well, how come I was the only one
that took the fall?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.391
How come you were
never indicted?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.676
A lot of questions.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.596
I had a lot of time
to think of them.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.274
I want the money you owe me.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.152
How do you figure
I owe you money, kid?

10:03.311 --> 10:06.611
- The fucking fight, Ronnie!
- Okay, I get it.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.492
Remember, kid,

10:09.651 --> 10:11.619
you were like a son to me.

10:11.778 --> 10:16.033
I don't got a lot right now,
but I've got some.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.294
Some's better than none, right?

10:23.873 --> 10:26.547
It's not much,
but it's all I got right now.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.974
- Are you fucking stupid?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.135
Do you think you can come in here
and make demands?

10:35.301 --> 10:38.646
You're on parole!
You don't dare touch me.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.366
You could've been
a great fucking loser!

10:40.390 --> 10:42.142
We could've made
a lot of money together.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.187
See, the way I figure,
you owe me.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.610
Ronnie.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.624
Oh, Jesus.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.680
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.933
Hello?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.934
9-1-1.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.845
Is anybody there?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.889
Stay on the line with me
if you can hear me.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.602
We'll dispatch a car
to this address.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.946
Jay? Hey, man!
Long time no see!

11:29.105 --> 11:30.698
Hey. Sorry, man.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.484
Jay? Hey!

11:32.650 --> 11:34.698
- What's your problem?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.406
Hey, watch it, man!

11:44.829 --> 11:48.174
I told Jay to stop by
tomorrow morning.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.544
I see.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.553
Don't do this, Chet.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.261
It's not fair.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.644
He turned his back
on his family.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.865
Wonder who that is.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.656
- Hi, Hanna!
- Hi!

12:19.822 --> 12:22.200
- Hi, Sheriff Mills.
- Not me.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.495
- My spurs are hung.
- Oh!

12:24.661 --> 12:26.254
It's so good to see you guys.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.791
- Seems like it's been forever.
- Look at you.

12:29.958 --> 12:33.258
What a pretty young woman
you turned into.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.387
You're the spitting
image of your mom.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.469
I remember my mom and dad
used to take me here

12:37.632 --> 12:39.100
for Thanksgiving
when I was little.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.933
Jay and I used to always feed
all those leftover bones and things

12:42.095 --> 12:43.938
to that big pig you guys had.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.770
Jay was always
going on about...

12:45.932 --> 12:48.185
So, uh, what brings you
out here now?

12:48.351 --> 12:52.697
Oh, um, we actually
have a bad situation.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.857
I wanted to give
you guys a heads up.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.947
What do you mean by bad?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.533
Late last night,
one of the tribal casinos

12:59.696 --> 13:01.289
down in Mt. Pleasant
was robbed.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.200
Two armed suspects
wearing masks.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.119
Anyone hurt?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.539
Around 6:00 this morning,
a state trooper came upon

13:08.705 --> 13:10.707
an accident site
a ways south of us.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.797
And when backup arrived,
they found the trooper shot to death.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.303
Oh, my God.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.384
One of the suspects
died in the crash.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.641
At least one more took
to the national forest here.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.473
We're setting up roadblocks
and sending in search teams,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.236
but it is possible
he could slip through,

13:24.345 --> 13:27.144
so we're just letting
all the families out here know.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.776
Well, it's a huge area.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.653
He'd never make it
this far north on foot.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.985
And the temperature's
supposed to keep dropping.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.741
I heard blizzard conditions.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.698
I say let him freeze to death.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.989
Coyotes will find him.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.813
What are you
looking at, Addison?

14:07.972 --> 14:10.395
Pardon me.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.606
It's okay to look.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.777
Hush! The devil
will hear you.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.910
What did I promise you
when we started this?

14:21.069 --> 14:23.288
That no one would get hurt.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.198
Well, I want you
to remember this...

14:25.365 --> 14:27.163
you didn't hurt anyone.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.578
I made the choice,
and now things are different.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.212
Different how?

14:31.371 --> 14:32.964
We're going to split up.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.669
They don't know
anything about you.

14:34.832 --> 14:38.006
- You were just a distraction.
- I don't like this plan.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.529
- I didn't ask you if you liked it.
- We shouldn't split up!

14:40.546 --> 14:43.265
Shh! Listen.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.803
You follow that path
and then cut toward the road.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.813
Use your wits.
Hitch a ride.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.599
Keep heading north.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.484
We can still make it to Canada.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.362
But till then,
you don't know me any more.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.239
I'm not your brother any more,

14:58.398 --> 15:01.151
not until I let you know
it's okay.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.997
Remember how I taught you?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.747
Leave your phone on,

15:09.909 --> 15:12.037
and I'll call you
tonight, okay?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.386
You're my little girl.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.888
Say it.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.925
I'm your little girl.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.934
That's good.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.517
Here you go.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.237
What if you don't call?

15:42.233 --> 15:44.452
Well, then I'm dead.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.625
So do you have any plans
for Thanksgiving?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.787
No, just dinner.
How about you?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.627
Any news from your mom, Hanna?

15:56.789 --> 16:00.384
- You?
- No, sweetie. Not in a long time.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.511
Well, it was really good
to see you.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.807
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.719
Oh, you should stop by
tomorrow for dinner.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.479
Oh, thanks.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.230
You know, I...

16:13.389 --> 16:15.312
I was going to ask my dad
if he had any plans,

16:15.475 --> 16:17.115
see if he wanted to do
something together.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.437
Okay.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.321
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.004
Hey, Doris!
What's the word?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.756
The word is shit,

16:38.915 --> 16:40.963
and there's a big pile of it
waiting for you in the office.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.002
- Becker?
- And the boys.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.342
Any mail come for me?
A letter?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.132
Didn't come in yet.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.845
- Well, let me know.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.181
We'll provide manpower
and additional search support

16:51.344 --> 16:52.544
along with the other counties.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.521
Shut the fucking door, eh?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.560
State K-9 teams won't
be here till late tonight,

16:56.724 --> 16:59.898
so we're going in
this afternoon with my dogs.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.779
Use your radios,
use your heads.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.815
Everybody wears their vests.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.700
If you come upon this guy,
call it in.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.406
We all want to make it home
for turkey dinner.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.788
Well, you keep talking, I'm not going
to make it for turkey dinner.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.325
Travis, this morning
while you were fucking

17:13.491 --> 17:14.834
that little rat you call a wife,

17:14.992 --> 17:17.665
this guy shot a cop
in the face.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.626
The cop's name
was Alan Townsend.

17:19.789 --> 17:23.009
He served as a trooper
for 18 years.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.885
That man is dead, gone forever.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.718
All right, all right.
Take it easy. Sorry.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.349
This is the real deal, boys.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.260
You understand?

17:32.426 --> 17:35.054
All right, now listen up.
Here's what we're going to do.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.724
Travis, Brice, Bill,
you'll be with me heading west

17:37.890 --> 17:39.650
from the accident site
toward the lake shore.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.068
The other four of you
will be led by Denny.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.229
You'll head east toward I-75.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.900
Okay?
Let's get going,

17:47.066 --> 17:49.444
What about me?

17:49.610 --> 17:50.953
What about you?

17:51.112 --> 17:53.740
- What team am I with?
- None.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.409
- What do you mean?
- I mean you ain't going out.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.079
- You can't do that.
- I'm responsible for these men's lives.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.088
I'll do whatever the hell I see fit.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.841
Besides, what if we got out there
and something major happened,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.048
like you had to change
your tampon?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.633
- No offense, Deputy.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.217
Then I'd change it, Dad.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.408
Shit.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.050
Coroner's going to probably be done
in about five minutes.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.465
- Okay.
- Check in with him, will you?

19:02.058 --> 19:03.810
Shit!

19:13.444 --> 19:14.991
Miss.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.324
- Miss, are you okay?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.254
Hey, hey.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.462
Are you all right?

20:53.127 --> 20:55.425
Come on, old pain!

21:00.342 --> 21:03.471
Ah, you no good mule!

21:07.349 --> 21:09.772
Start, God damn you!

21:14.398 --> 21:18.323
- You rotten old pile of shit!

21:59.026 --> 22:01.529
- Ha!

22:01.695 --> 22:05.825
I have a past wife
that comes to me in dreams.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.789
She told me you'd be coming.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.844
You can barely
see anything out there.

23:03.007 --> 23:06.056
- Yeah. It's going into white-out.
- What?

23:06.218 --> 23:08.721
When you can't see
what's right in front of you.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.026
My car broke down.
I got lost.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.024
You live around here?

23:22.401 --> 23:25.621
My folks.
They live close to the border.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.407
I'm just passing through.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.041
You think you could
give me a lift?

23:33.203 --> 23:35.752
No.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.963
I'm sorry.
I can't.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.924
I'll drop you at the next
gas station, all right?

24:02.608 --> 24:05.953
This is kind of like an old movie,
don't you think?

24:06.111 --> 24:07.454
What is?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.911
Us.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.748
Two people meeting
in a snowstorm.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.122
I guess.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.803
What's your name?

24:22.962 --> 24:25.681
What do you want it to be?

24:25.839 --> 24:28.809
Come on, didn't you ever play
pretend when you were a kid?

24:28.968 --> 24:31.972
We're strangers.
We can be whoever we want.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.356
So, who am I?

24:34.515 --> 24:36.358
- Come on, give me a name.
- Look, I'm sorry.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.940
- I really don't...
- Shh.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.480
Name me.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.991
Patricia.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.575
I like that.

24:48.737 --> 24:52.833
Patricia, the bad girl.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.517
The FBI Academy!

25:13.679 --> 25:15.898
You passed the exam!

25:16.056 --> 25:18.809
I'm so damn proud of you, honey.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.603
Yeah.

25:20.769 --> 25:24.194
Well, I don't know.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.242
Hanna, you're going
to be an FBI agent

25:27.401 --> 25:30.780
and you're finally getting
to leave this shit hole.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.369
Turn around and look at me.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.418
He's a son of a bitch, Hanna.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.125
- Who?
- Who do you think?

25:39.288 --> 25:40.756
The sheriff, your dad!

25:40.914 --> 25:43.133
No. He's not that bad.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.511
He doesn't really
mean it, you know?

25:45.669 --> 25:48.468
It's just been hard for him
since my mom took off.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.224
That was years ago, Hanna.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.855
You're not actually
considering giving this up?

25:56.972 --> 25:58.565
Why?

25:58.724 --> 26:01.773
So you can take care of him?

26:01.935 --> 26:04.154
I'm all he's got left.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.900
This is from my heart, honey.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.115
This is your life,

26:10.277 --> 26:13.702
and you only get one.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.878
- Ah!

28:52.189 --> 28:53.736
Well, good luck.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.401
Thanks for rescuing me.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.864
Hey, folks.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.779
Just to let you know,
state police were just here.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.119
- They're closing the roads.
- Are you serious?

29:01.281 --> 29:02.624
Full-on blizzard.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.535
Plows can't get through
till the morning.

29:04.701 --> 29:08.080
So batten down the hatches
and pull up a stool.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.341
You're probably going
to be here all night.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.501
I know I will.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.172
- You got a phone?
- Oh, yeah.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.261
Pay phone's in back by the can.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.316
Hey, it's me.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.817
I'm at this place.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.525
I'm stuck here for the night.

30:13.687 --> 30:16.907
There's this guy.
He's the perfect ride.

30:17.065 --> 30:20.069
His parents have a place
near the border.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.237
I'm going to get him
to take me there.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.953
The address is 207

30:25.115 --> 30:28.415
Old Mills Farm Road, Bear Lake.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.539
Can you make it there?

30:32.706 --> 30:35.129
I hope you're okay.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.634
Okay. Bye.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.901
Hey, can I get you a drink?

30:53.060 --> 30:55.358
- I'm okay.
- Ah, first one's on me.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.692
Call it a snowstorm special.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.232
You and your wife?

30:58.398 --> 31:00.366
Oh, we'd love a drink.
Thank you.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.404
You're welcome.
Here you go.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.197
My name's Patricia.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.991
This is my husband Addison.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.751
Addison?
That's a funny one.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.457
It's his daddy's name.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.545
You two married long?

31:18.168 --> 31:19.886
No. We're pretty new at it.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.389
Ah, thought so.
Still got the glow.

31:22.547 --> 31:26.097
Well, my name's Mandy
and this is my bar.

31:26.259 --> 31:27.636
Got it in the divorce.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.476
Never used to come in here
when he ran the place,

31:29.638 --> 31:31.936
- but now I love it.
- Hey, Mandy!

31:32.099 --> 31:35.103
Now, how about bringing us
some more pitchers, huh?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.402
My ex-sister-in-law Tricia.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.737
Listen, honey.
You can pick the guy.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.153
You just can't pick the family.

32:13.723 --> 32:16.943
Come here!

32:18.270 --> 32:20.113
Come to Mommy!
Come here!

32:20.272 --> 32:22.866
- Lisa, get back here!
- Stop it! No!

32:23.024 --> 32:25.072
- No!
- Lisa, come.

32:25.235 --> 32:26.236
Come here, baby.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.701
Come here, come here.
No, stop it!

32:28.864 --> 32:30.958
Lisa, you get your ass
back in the cabin

32:31.116 --> 32:33.118
if you know
what's good for you!

32:33.285 --> 32:35.834
Come to Mommy.
Come to me.

32:35.996 --> 32:39.876
- No. No!
- That goes for your mother, too,

32:40.041 --> 32:43.295
or I'll be hunting
more than deer tomorrow!

32:43.462 --> 32:45.135
You're not going anywhere!

32:45.297 --> 32:46.970
There's nothing for miles!

32:47.132 --> 32:50.477
That baby's going to freeze!

32:50.635 --> 32:53.184
I'll be waiting!

32:53.346 --> 32:56.099
- No!

33:25.045 --> 33:26.888
Don't you move.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.137
Take your coat and go outside.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.441
- Who are you...
- Shut your mouth!

33:38.600 --> 33:40.853
Liza, get outside now.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.566
Her name's Lisa.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.481
She only does what I tell her.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.076
You'll be dead before
your hand touches it.

33:51.071 --> 33:54.666
Lisa, your mom's up
on the hill with the baby.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.703
She's very cold
and she needs your help.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.269
You need to take her
something warm.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.169
You stay right there, Lisa.

34:01.331 --> 34:03.208
He ain't got the guts
to do it in front of you.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.719
Probably wouldn't be good
for a little girl

34:05.877 --> 34:08.380
seeing her stepfather killed.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.889
Later in life, I mean.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.176
I want my mom.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.687
She's up on the hill
with the baby.

34:15.844 --> 34:18.974
- You're fucking my wife, is that it?
- Lisa, leave now.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.393
- Shh.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.608
Is that who you are, huh?

34:23.770 --> 34:25.647
I knew it.
I fucking knew it!

34:25.813 --> 34:27.110
Go ahead!

34:27.274 --> 34:29.822
You can have her,
the little fucking slut!

34:29.985 --> 34:31.362
Fuck you!

34:31.527 --> 34:34.748
- Fuck you...

34:42.746 --> 34:45.670
So, tell me something
about you, Addison.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.634
What do you want to know?

34:50.797 --> 34:52.299
I don't know.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.308
What do you do for a living?

34:54.467 --> 34:56.435
Why are you always so serious?

34:56.594 --> 34:57.972
Anything.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.149
I was a boxer,

35:01.308 --> 35:04.812
but it seems like
a long time ago now.

35:04.978 --> 35:07.481
Like a boxer in the ring boxer?

35:07.647 --> 35:10.366
Mm-hmm.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.449
Yeah, my dad trained me
since I was a kid.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.157
Got me all the way
to the Beijing games.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.043
Wow, you must have
been really good.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.295
I won the silver medal.

35:24.914 --> 35:27.337
- Is that it?

35:27.500 --> 35:28.752
You have it on you?

35:28.918 --> 35:31.797
I don't usually,
but I happen to be today.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.761
Can I...

35:36.760 --> 35:38.933
Wow!

35:39.095 --> 35:41.814
That is really cool.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.817
It ain't the gold, but...

35:44.976 --> 35:47.980
It's amazing.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.148
I've never been good
at anything.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.519
Here we go.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.313
You're going to have to help.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.197
Carry the baby.

36:31.356 --> 36:34.326
This boy needs you, okay?

36:34.484 --> 36:37.203
He can't make it without you.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.364
Here you go.

36:52.168 --> 36:55.638
Lisa, you can help
your mom and the baby

36:55.797 --> 36:58.175
by getting in here

36:58.341 --> 37:00.343
and getting under the covers
and cuddling up.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.184
There you go.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.064
Cuddle up real tight,

37:05.223 --> 37:07.567
while I have a think
for a minute.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.803
You know, Lisa,

37:35.962 --> 37:38.431
I'm trying to imagine
how you must feel.

37:40.717 --> 37:44.438
I think it would be
a complicated feeling.

37:46.473 --> 37:51.024
I guess right now nothing
in the whole world seems safe.

37:51.186 --> 37:54.486
Your stepdaddy's gone.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.275
Your mom's sick.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.241
And you're in the forest
with a stranger.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.537
Ah!

38:09.496 --> 38:11.214
What happened to your hand?

38:13.541 --> 38:17.466
Well, I got into a fight

38:17.629 --> 38:20.303
with a great Indian chief.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.184
He cut my finger off.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.478
Did you kill him?

38:29.641 --> 38:32.144
Yes, I did.

38:33.436 --> 38:36.315
Are you going to kill me?

38:36.481 --> 38:38.483
No.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.534
You're a child.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.290
Children should be protected.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.498
Angels protect me.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.629
Maybe that's how
you should think of me.

38:58.795 --> 39:02.516
I'm like an angel
come down from the storm

39:02.674 --> 39:06.304
to remove that man
from your life.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.825
Once you're up
at this cottage of yours

39:24.988 --> 39:28.538
all by your lonesome,
what then?

39:30.410 --> 39:33.505
I don't know.

39:33.663 --> 39:36.212
I just need to think
for a while, you know?

39:40.003 --> 39:43.007
I couldn't stand that.

39:43.172 --> 39:46.642
I hate being alone.
It scares me, always has.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.521
If you still want it,

39:54.684 --> 39:57.403
I'll give you a lift
to the border.

40:02.442 --> 40:05.821
I wish you hadn't
stopped for me.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.490
I wish somebody else
had come along.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.999
I wish I was somebody else.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.279
Just pretend, okay?

40:41.272 --> 40:44.116
I'm not pretending.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.619
Fuck me, Addison.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.435
So, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

42:38.598 --> 42:40.225
A nurse.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.689
Grandma Vicky is a nurse.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.106
I always wanted to be a farmer.

42:46.272 --> 42:49.367
We had a fruit farm.
Peaches mostly.

42:49.525 --> 42:53.746
But my daddy was a drunk
and he ran it into the ground.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.750
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to fix it up

42:57.909 --> 43:01.004
and farm it just right.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.463
Can I change the baby?

43:09.629 --> 43:11.597
Yeah.

43:24.894 --> 43:26.441
Liza:
Hey, it's me.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.528
I'm at this place.
I'm stuck here for the night.

43:29.690 --> 43:31.909
There's this guy.
He's the perfect ride.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.411
His family lives
near the border.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.049
I'm going to get him
to take me there.

43:35.196 --> 43:39.997
The address is 207
Old Mills Farm Road, Bear Lake.

43:40.159 --> 43:41.661
Can you make it there?

43:43.996 --> 43:46.124
You'll make a great nurse.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.127
I have a baby sister.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.853
When we were kids, I used to
take care of her, just like you are.

43:52.004 --> 43:54.348
Where is she now?

43:55.466 --> 43:58.015
She's out there somewhere.

44:06.769 --> 44:09.443
I think you should leave
your sister alone.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.350
It's about Amy, my daughter.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.859
- You know her.
- Sure.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.941
She was a couple of years
ahead of me at school, but sure.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.150
Please.

44:50.313 --> 44:52.657
Then you know
she's always been afraid

44:52.815 --> 44:54.488
to be without a man in her life.

44:54.650 --> 44:56.277
It's probably because
of her dad and I.

44:56.444 --> 44:57.696
We never...

44:57.862 --> 44:59.622
Please, Mrs. Woodward,
tell me what happened.

44:59.655 --> 45:02.078
She didn't come home
last night.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.414
She was supposed
to come to my house...

45:04.577 --> 45:07.626
she and the kids
and her husband Bobby.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.712
He's a horrible man,
a violent man.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.218
Do you know him?

45:12.376 --> 45:14.970
We've had calls to their house
on a few occasions.

45:16.505 --> 45:19.179
Well, she was going to ask him
for a divorce yesterday.

45:19.342 --> 45:21.891
- Did you try calling?
- No.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.771
They were at Bobby's
hunting cabin.

45:23.930 --> 45:25.273
There's no phone there.

45:25.431 --> 45:27.559
There's no nothing,
and it's out in the woods.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.102
Could you please check on her?

45:29.268 --> 45:32.192
Make sure... just tell me
everything's all right.

45:32.355 --> 45:34.949
Make me feel like
a silly old mother.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.905
Sure.

45:42.240 --> 45:46.586
I'll be home around noon,
unless I'm tracking one.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.918
- Hey.
- Yeah?

45:50.081 --> 45:51.754
You've been pretty quiet
this morning.

45:51.916 --> 45:56.342
- You okay?
- Yeah.

45:56.504 --> 46:00.680
You know, parenting isn't easy,
Chet, not for anyone.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.388
You make it look that way.

46:02.551 --> 46:05.771
Well, just because I'm better
at hiding the hard parts.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.774
And you're always graceful.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.735
In case you get hungry.

46:16.482 --> 46:20.077
I thought you said
your spurs were hung.

46:20.236 --> 46:22.489
It's better to have and not need.

46:23.656 --> 46:25.158
Okay, then.

46:27.076 --> 46:29.295
Stay warm.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.290
Don't tell me what to do.

46:52.351 --> 46:54.524
It's getting light out.

46:54.687 --> 46:56.940
Where are you?

46:57.106 --> 46:58.699
Are you still alive?

46:58.858 --> 47:00.781
I think I'd feel it if you died.

47:00.943 --> 47:03.196
I mean, at least
I think I would.

47:03.362 --> 47:06.912
I feel like I just have to...
I have to keep moving.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.086
Addison?

47:12.288 --> 47:16.839
Everything is just...
everything's getting so confusing.

47:20.046 --> 47:22.890
That guy I told you about,

47:23.049 --> 47:26.223
he turned out to be a real jerk.

47:26.385 --> 47:29.104
He just disappeared
on me, so...

47:31.223 --> 47:33.726
I'll find another way,

47:33.893 --> 47:36.021
and I'll call you.

47:36.187 --> 47:39.361
Or you call me.
Where are you?

47:39.523 --> 47:41.946
Okay. Bye.

48:21.899 --> 48:25.278
Hey! Hey!

48:28.864 --> 48:30.286
Hey, buddy.
What's your problem?

48:30.449 --> 48:33.123
I'll put you in a fucking coma!

48:33.285 --> 48:35.959
Drive the fuck away!

48:36.122 --> 48:38.090
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

48:38.249 --> 48:40.672
- Last night was fun and all, but...
- But what?

48:40.835 --> 48:43.805
- But it was just a game!
- That is bullshit and you know it.

48:43.963 --> 48:47.217
Do I? You don't even
know my name.

48:48.467 --> 48:50.140
So tell me.

48:50.302 --> 48:53.272
What does it matter?
I could've been anybody.

48:54.723 --> 48:56.725
It matters to me.

48:58.227 --> 49:00.525
Why are you doing this?

49:12.158 --> 49:14.536
Hey, Bill, you order breakfast?

49:14.702 --> 49:17.581
- Come on, Travis.

49:22.001 --> 49:23.423
What are you doing here, Hanna?

49:23.586 --> 49:24.678
Becker will have your head.

49:24.837 --> 49:26.760
Vicky Woodward is worried
about her daughter.

49:26.922 --> 49:29.016
Their cabin's a couple
of miles from here.

49:29.175 --> 49:31.598
Where's Becker?

49:31.760 --> 49:33.353
Headed north about an hour ago

49:33.512 --> 49:34.934
to meet with the state police.

49:35.097 --> 49:36.849
You want us
to come with you?

49:37.016 --> 49:38.768
Not necessary.

49:38.934 --> 49:41.357
No, it probably is.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.886
When I was 10, I watched
my father bleed to death

50:09.048 --> 50:11.551
in the weeds beside our house.

50:11.717 --> 50:14.766
He pulled himself across
the yard with his arms,

50:14.929 --> 50:17.682
screamed at me,
and then he died.

50:17.848 --> 50:20.226
Someone shot him.

50:20.392 --> 50:22.520
Want to know what I did next?

50:26.357 --> 50:29.577
Washed him off
with the garden hose,

50:29.735 --> 50:31.533
combed his hair,

50:31.695 --> 50:34.995
sat beside him and waited
for someone to find me.

50:38.786 --> 50:41.335
Who found you?

50:44.124 --> 50:46.126
My brother.

50:47.795 --> 50:51.265
He turned off the hose
and took me for a walk.

50:53.509 --> 50:55.511
What happened then?

50:58.222 --> 51:00.771
A lot of strangers
at our house, a lot of cops.

51:00.933 --> 51:03.937
People trying to figure out
where to put me.

51:08.899 --> 51:11.243
My father was a monster.

51:12.653 --> 51:14.906
An animal.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.995
And he died like one.

51:25.874 --> 51:28.252
I'm supposed to be a grownup.

51:30.170 --> 51:34.300
If I was someone else,
I could have a husband of my own,

51:34.466 --> 51:36.719
be having my own babies.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.814
Instead I'm all messed up.

52:08.876 --> 52:10.970
Liza.

52:12.463 --> 52:14.682
My name is Liza.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.677
I'm Jay.

53:20.114 --> 53:21.616
What's the matter, Hanna?

53:21.782 --> 53:23.705
Why are we stopping?

53:23.867 --> 53:26.586
Guys, it looks like
this was left here.

53:26.745 --> 53:28.747
- Strange, huh?
- So what?

54:30.476 --> 54:32.228
- Becker, do you copy?
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

54:32.394 --> 54:33.646
I'm calling it in to Becker
for backup.

54:33.812 --> 54:35.064
Calling in what?

54:35.230 --> 54:36.482
It's a snowmobile
and a hunting cabin.

54:36.648 --> 54:38.650
While the two of you
have your little spat,

54:38.817 --> 54:40.319
I'm just going to go
and do my job.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.705
- We have to check it out.
- Okay, fine.

54:42.863 --> 54:45.383
So we check it out, but don't go
calling Becker now for nothing.

54:45.407 --> 54:47.767
Me and Brice are the ones
who are gonna end up in deep shit.

54:47.785 --> 54:50.413
Becker told us to call.
I'm calling.

54:50.579 --> 54:52.627
Becker, do you copy?

54:52.790 --> 54:54.167
What the hell?

54:54.333 --> 54:56.085
- You can't do that!
- Can't do what?

54:58.670 --> 55:01.549
Such an asshole.

55:07.179 --> 55:09.398
Hello! Bobby?

55:09.556 --> 55:11.524
Hello?

55:11.683 --> 55:13.443
- It's the sheriff's office.

55:13.477 --> 55:14.524
Hello!

55:19.358 --> 55:21.326
You're going to get us
in trouble, Hanna.

55:21.485 --> 55:23.783
I know it's early.

55:23.946 --> 55:25.493
We'd just like
to have a quick word.

55:29.284 --> 55:31.707
Oh, my God.

55:35.249 --> 55:36.250
Hello?

55:36.416 --> 55:37.918
Brice!

55:38.085 --> 55:40.884
Get away!
It's him!

55:42.714 --> 55:44.216
- Brice?

55:44.383 --> 55:47.262
- You're no angel at all.

55:47.427 --> 55:49.896
No, I am not.

55:50.055 --> 55:53.184
Brice, you all right?

55:53.350 --> 55:55.978
Christ!
Hanna, get down!

56:02.317 --> 56:04.411
Come on!

56:15.831 --> 56:17.424
Oh, fuck!

57:20.103 --> 57:23.403
- You all right?

57:23.565 --> 57:25.442
You're not even supposed
to be here, Hanna!

57:28.153 --> 57:30.656
God damn it, Travis!

58:18.704 --> 58:20.832
Travis!

59:08.879 --> 59:11.428
You know this is
my first snowman?

59:11.590 --> 59:12.933
You're shitting me.

59:13.091 --> 59:16.595
Ha, not a lot of snow
in Alabama.

59:16.762 --> 59:18.935
One night when I was a kid,

59:19.097 --> 59:20.440
the Northern Lights were out

59:20.599 --> 59:22.719
and my dad and I made
these snowmen out in the pasture

59:22.768 --> 59:24.896
like a boxing match...

59:25.062 --> 59:27.906
two snow fighters
throwing punches.

59:28.065 --> 59:31.490
I remember I didn't want
to go to bed that night.

59:31.651 --> 59:34.700
My dad carried me
all the way back to the house.

59:40.243 --> 59:44.965
When I got down
off the podium in Beijing,

59:45.123 --> 59:47.501
he was so fucking proud of me.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.304
And then later
in the dressing room,

59:51.463 --> 59:54.137
I told him I was
leaving home to go pro.

59:54.299 --> 59:56.393
I said to him...

59:56.551 --> 01:00:00.806
I said if I had a real coach,
maybe I'd have won the gold.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:08.113
He still love you?

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.319
Yeah, I guess, but...

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.985
Well, you're lucky.

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.620
You should see him.

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:28.793
If I was going to see him,

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.212
I'd like to introduce you.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:37.476
It's Thanksgiving.
That's standard procedure.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:40.433
You don't want me there,
Jay, seriously.

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.433
I seriously do.

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:51.319
What about Patricia?
Isn't she going to be there?

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.824
Who?

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.577
Now, don't tell me
there's no Patricia.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.705
Who is she to you?

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.047
I'd rather not talk about her.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:12.173
It's kind of personal.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.430
I think I've told you
some personal things, Jay.

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:19.597
- Miss December.
- What?

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.352
Patricia is Miss December.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.936
"Playboy", Christmas issue.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:28.227
She's a centerfold?

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:30.066
A nudie picture?

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:36.569
And did you two have
a meaningful relationship?

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.328
- We did.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:41.956
She was very understanding,
not too demanding.

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:45.085
And were you... were you
faithful to her, Jay?

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:46.244
I was.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:48.004
She was my one and only.

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.257
She never let me down.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:55.053
Hey, lovebirds!

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.431
Roads are open!

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.594
And to answer your question,
she probably won't be

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.229
at Thanksgiving dinner
at my parents' house.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.685
Good.
Bitch better stay clear.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.702
Guys!

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.033
Dad, I think I shot him.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.244
I think he's wounded.

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:08.536
He's wearing a buckskin jacket

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:12.081
with a blackbird or an eagle.

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:13.499
At least I think
it's an eagle on the back...

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.292
Just shut your mouth.

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.586
- Dad!
- I said shut your mouth!

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.798
I told you to stay
out of the woods!

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:23.137
You see what happens
when you stick your nose in?

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.177
People start dying!

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:26.811
Where's Travis?

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:32.685
Afield, about 10 miles west.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.819
He's dead?

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:39.824
If you were one of my boys,

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:42.406
I would hit you
so fucking hard.

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:45.869
If I were one of your boys,
you'd be proud of me.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.347
I want everybody
the hell out of here.

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:51.711
All of you.
You hear me?

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.213
- But I can help...
- All of you!

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:58.171
Shut up!

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.336
Chester Mills,
you'd better not be

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:43.756
- walking in here with your boots...
- Shh.

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:46.892
What's your name?

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.098
June.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.480
June, put that pan down, please.

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:03.237
Is there anyone else
in the house, June?

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.573
No.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.363
Step down and take a seat.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.164
Who might come home, June?

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:15.328
My husband...

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.715
- Chet.
- Where is he?

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:21.467
Deer hunting.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:23.128
He'll be armed?

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.049
With a rifle.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.436
Why are you so calm?

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:43.527
A panicking woman
is no help to anyone.

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.825
I like you, June.

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:52.741
You do as I say, and I won't
hurt you or your family.

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:55.622
Thank you.

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:10.592
Would you mind op...

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:14.517
opening a window, please?

01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:51.717
May I take a look at that?

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:53.681
Are you my mother?

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:57.472
I'm somebody's mother.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.798
Ah, shit!

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.210
You'll live.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.254
Well, that remains
to be determined, June,

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.172
but thank you.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.390
Do not turn around.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:39.352
Do exactly what I say.

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:41.266
Slowly put your hands
on your head,

01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:43.105
interlocking your fingers.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.903
To do that, I'd have
to take my hand

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:50.158
off the gun I have pointed
at June on the table,

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:52.193
which isn't going to happen.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.579
He will shoot you, kiddo.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.114
I don't think he will.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.124
Don't try me, son.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:01.628
No. He has too much to lose.

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:06.838
Sir, believe me when I say
that I genuinely like June.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:13.135
So, for both of us,
would you please back down?

01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:20.145
God damn it.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.854
Open the rifle action
and put the gun on the floor.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:31.279
Take a seat beside your wife.

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:35.745
I'm sorry.

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:37.871
Nothing to be sorry for.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:42.002
Chet, is it?
How was the hunting?

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.663
You know, when I was a kid,
we had a Springfield 20 gauge.

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.050
We used to hunt
ducks and coons.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.471
You bake pies
from scratch, June.

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:01.475
For Thanksgiving I do.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.857
Oh, that's right.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:06.188
It's Thanksgiving.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:09.779
Would it be all right

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:12.359
if we went ahead
and served dinner?

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:16.990
It'd be really nice
to have a good meal.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:20.157
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- I would like that.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:21.950
- Honey...
- Chet, we have to eat.

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:23.493
It will occupy us.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.627
Keep things from getting
too crazy.

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.038
Thank you, June.

01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:29.048
Don't thank me.
Chet shot the goose.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:32.131
Well, thank you, Chet.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.011
What are you looking for?

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:41.219
Nothing.
I'm just, uh...

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:43.889
Wondering if the police
are waiting for you?

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:48.685
I know what people are like
when they're on the run.

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:56.567
I fucked up.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:01.114
It wasn't my fault, but...

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.955
I'm not going back to prison.

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:06.961
I can't.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:23.182
Is it safe?

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.566
Who's that, June?

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:35.698
Oh, my God.
It's our son.

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:37.359
It's Jay.

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:44.916
Well, well, well.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:52.461
Careful.
The steps are icy.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.094
- Hey, Mom.
- Jay.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.721
On, Jay.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.636
- I brought a guest.
- Jay, listen to me.

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:06.975
There's a man in our house
and he has a gun.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:10.558
Don't!
Don't do anything.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:12.568
He'll hurt your dad.

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.105
Please just... just come in,
both of you.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:21.695
Dad, you okay?

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:24.364
I'm okay, son.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.077
Good afternoon.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.208
You must be Jay.

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.290
What do you want?

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.080
And this must be your wife.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:35.625
- She's my friend.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:38.762
Well, I think the lady
can speak for herself.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.263
What's your name?

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:44.221
Liza.

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.511
Well, that's a nice name.

01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:48.224
Take a seat.

01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:54.315
Both of you.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.775
The goose should be done soon.
Is that correct, June?

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:58.485
- Yes.
- Great.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.868
I don't know about you all,
but I'm famished.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.073
Chet, here.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.584
Have some wine.

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.837
Take it away from me.
It's going straight to my head.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:16.716
I need some food
and I need some sleep.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:19.627
Besides, it's Thanksgiving.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.477
Are you testing me, Jay?

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.898
Because that would be
a terrible idea.

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:11.096
Becker:
This is Sheriff T. Becker,

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.390
requesting the state
police crime scene unit

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:14.899
and county coroner.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.276
And be advised
we're losing daylight

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:20.439
and must stay
on the suspect’s trail.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:22.778
Happy Thanksgiving, Mom.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.460
Hello.

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.019
Yeah, this is the sheriff's office.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.293
Hanna Becker speaking.

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.129
Sure.

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:48.058
Detective Frank Mack,
Detroit Police Department.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:53.471
Say that again?

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:56.061
Oh. Yeah,
I know the family.

01:13:56.223 --> 01:13:57.816
I know where they live.

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:04.316
A concussion?
So you need his statement.

01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:06.610
Got it.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:09.529
I'll go over there.
I'll let you know.

01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:13.283
Happy holiday to you, too.

01:14:16.327 --> 01:14:18.625
Jesus Christ.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:26.300
June, do you say grace
at Thanksgiving?

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.180
We give thanks.

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:29.841
And how does that work?

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:34.228
We all go around, say something
we're thankful for.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.981
An excellent idea.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.141
Would you mind starting?

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.106
Please?

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.985
I'm thankful for this food,

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:52.280
for God's charity,

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:54.699
and for giving me
His two greatest men,

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:57.334
my husband and my son.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.336
Well said.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:04.129
Chet, you're next.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:08.012
I'm thankful for June,
the love of my life.

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:12.641
Wow, that was sweet, Chet!

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.553
How about your son?

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.691
What's wrong with him, hmm?

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:26.071
Let's ask him.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.824
Jay, what are you grateful for?

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:31.077
It's none of your
fucking business.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:33.704
No, you're missing
the point, Jay.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.464
Well, I'm not going
to give you anything.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:38.751
- Jay, it's your turn.
- Addison, please stop.

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:40.957
These people haven't done
anything to you.

01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:47.380
You best watch
your mouth, little girl.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.513
Don't you forget
where you belong.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:56.052
Give thanks, Jay.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:58.892
And you'd better say something
I know you really mean.

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:01.478
You think I'm afraid of you?

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.108
Look at you.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:05.065
You're nothing without that gun.

01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:11.284
What if this is your daddy's
last moment of life?

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:13.410
What do you want him
to take with him?

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:17.119
Jay. Please, honey.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:24.547
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.797
I messed everything up so bad.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:33.969
That fight, they told me
it was the only way

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:36.304
they'd give me a shot at the title.

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:39.895
I laid down.

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:44.650
I let him beat me.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:50.235
I don't deserve to be
sitting at your table.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.412
This is your table, son.

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:08.542
And you're not the only one
who messed up.

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:37.069
Once again, June,

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:40.536
the goose was really
quite wonderful.

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:42.792
What are you going to do?

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.373
I'm going to have
some more red wine.

01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:48.289
I'm going to have some more
of your wife's homemade pie.

01:17:48.455 --> 01:17:51.299
About the police.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:52.835
I don't know, Chet.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:54.720
I feel pretty good
just sitting here.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.723
Hey, it's Hanna.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:04.685
Hanna Becker.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.645
We know that officer.

01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:08.150
She's a friend of the family.

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:11.813
Just dropping by
on Thanksgiving?

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:16.366
- I invited her.
- That slip your mind, June?

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:20.742
Ask her in.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.371
No.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:25.876
Do it.

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:30.210
Come on in, Hanna.

01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:33.626
Hey, everybody.
Sorry to interrupt.

01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:35.260
I don't think
you know everyone.

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:37.842
- This is...
- I'm the killer.

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:41.517
The one you're all looking for.

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:43.552
I'm sorry, Hanna.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.767
I didn't know what to do.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.273
I wouldn't either.

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.604
Give me your belt.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.115
Take a seat.

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:00.244
Go on.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:04.828
June, would you please
serve some pie?

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:08.127
Do you want pumpkin or apple?

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:09.958
I'm going to have pumpkin.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.748
Seems more appropriate
for the holidays.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:16.586
So, Hanna, what are
you doing here?

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.595
Thank you.

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.631
It's Thanksgiving.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:23.927
Don't you got anybody
of your own?

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:26.892
I'm here for Jay.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:29.148
Hey.

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:31.479
- Long time.
- Yeah.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.692
I got a call from
a detective in Detroit.

01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:37.197
He needs to talk with you.

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:38.699
Whoops.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.257
You in trouble
with the police, Jay?

01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:44.205
That's kind of embarrassing
for your folks.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:46.786
I mean, this all seems
pretty wholesome.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.748
What went wrong, buddy?

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.333
What are they after you for?

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:53.839
I'm dying to know.

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:57.002
I have something I'd like
to give thanks for.

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.672
What's that?

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:04.308
My brother.

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:08.641
Why?

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.181
Because when we were little,

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:13.351
he protected me
when I couldn't protect myself.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:16.654
I was so young.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.656
He thinks I can't remember,
but I remember all of it.

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:25.614
The sound of the gun,
the blood on my shoe.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.872
My brother killed the devil.

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:34.255
He saved me from hell,
and I am forever thankful.

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:37.542
I love him so much for it.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:45.808
But now I need a...
I need a chance.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.887
I need a chance at my own life,

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:53.900
and I want
my brother's blessing.

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:59.906
I need him to please let me go.

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:29.722
Eat.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:36.100
Eat!

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:13.308
Hmm.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:19.811
You two in love?

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:25.612
You think he loves you?

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:33.412
Do you think he loves you?

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:37.036
Look at me.

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:39.960
Look at me!

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.501
- Don't fucking touch her!
- Sit!

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:51.016
You put your hand on the table
where I can see it.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:56.184
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:22:56.346 --> 01:22:59.475
Sit down!
Sit, June, sit!

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.357
God damn you to hell.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.114
Addison, please.
Come on, let's just go.

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:07.445
- Just you and me.
- No, baby.

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:09.326
Come on, let's go right now.
Come on.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:11.158
- We're way past that now.
- I'm your little girl.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.164
No. Please.

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.997
Did you fuck her, Jay?
Did you?

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:18.502
You think he cares about you?

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.379
You look at your boyfriend now.

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:23.290
- Look at him!
- Please, God, no!

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:25.380
You look at your family.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:27.590
You look what
you've done! Huh?

01:23:27.753 --> 01:23:30.552
This is Sheriff T. Becker
requesting immediate backup.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.216
I'm going into
the Old Mills Farm,

01:23:32.382 --> 01:23:35.056
Mills Farm Road
off county line 55.

01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:37.313
Possible manhunt suspect
on premises,

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:40.224
described as wearing
a deerskin jacket

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.564
with an eagle emblem,
possibly wounded.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:45.479
Copy that. Units en route.

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:47.444
Be advised not to engage
until backup...

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:49.005
Shh.

01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:04.641
Dad, the living room.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:07.774
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:11.152
I'm glad you could make it.

01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:15.068
Don't!

01:25:15.235 --> 01:25:17.613
- Please don't!
- Ah!

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.747
- No!

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:51.981
Jay!

01:25:53.857 --> 01:25:55.029
Please!

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.158
Please.

01:26:03.033 --> 01:26:05.536
He's my brother.

01:26:20.133 --> 01:26:22.727
- You love her, Jay?

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.854
Do you love her, Jay?

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:34.482
Yes, I do.

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.604
Sheriff Mills! To the right!

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:10.142
- You take the girl. Go!
- I got her.

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:12.606
Addison...

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:20.782
Ma'am. Ma'am.
Get him out of here!

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:22.787
Ma'am, I need you to get back.

01:27:22.946 --> 01:27:25.495
Please, I need you to get back.

01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:28.957
Ma'am.
Get an ambulance!

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.496
Come on.

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.255
That's it.

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:41.511
That other officer, the sheriff,
wasn't wearing a vest.

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:43.266
He's in rough shape.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:45.427
Do you know who
his next of kin is?

01:27:59.065 --> 01:28:02.239
What would home look like?

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:06.407
I don't know.

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:10.328
A farmhouse in the valley,
I guess,

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:14.294
like the one we grew up in,
Liza and I.
