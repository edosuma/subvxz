<i>As a child,</i>

32:39.876 --> 32:43.375
<i>I didn't know how monumental
the deals were</i>

32:43.459 --> 32:46.083
<i>that my dad was involved in.</i>

32:46.167 --> 32:48.792
I just knew he was
really, really busy.

32:53.083 --> 32:55.083
But PayPal is
an exciting company,

32:55.167 --> 32:57.959
but it should have been
spun off, but the board
didn't wanna lose it.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.250
After we were fighting
to spin it off for three years,

33:00.334 --> 33:02.542
and the CEO suddenly
had an epiphany.

33:02.626 --> 33:06.125
"Wow, great idea I just had.
Let's spin off PayPal."

33:06.209 --> 33:07.626

33:07.709 --> 33:09.459
He works all the time.

33:09.542 --> 33:12.125

that's his mission.

33:14.083 --> 33:15.667
What's surprising is

33:15.751 --> 33:17.334

33:17.417 --> 33:20.083

have a point.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.918
And I don't like them, I mean,
because I don't like socialism.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.626

but what they are saying,

33:25.709 --> 33:28.250
this wealth gap,
the tremendous wealth gap,

33:28.334 --> 33:30.083
-should not exist.
-Yeah.

33:30.167 --> 33:32.709
People on Wall Street
are tremendously overpaid.

33:32.792 --> 33:36.250

ridiculous incomes,

33:36.334 --> 33:39.292

33:39.375 --> 33:41.667
You know, I think my father

33:46.250 --> 33:48.042

33:48.125 --> 33:52.334

35:24.167 --> 35:27.167
I had to learn one area

35:27.250 --> 35:29.209
I looked at the option world.

35:29.292 --> 35:33.167
I realized there
was something awry,
that there was a problem.

35:33.250 --> 35:34.751
Options were mysterious.

35:34.834 --> 35:37.626

36:00.417 --> 36:03.125

36:03.209 --> 36:04.834

with something called

36:04.918 --> 36:06.626
"The Midweek Option Report,"

36:06.709 --> 36:08.209

"This is what you should have
been getting for your option

he thought he was

1:03:27.167 --> 1:03:29.959

1:03:30.042 --> 1:03:32.250

1:03:32.334 --> 1:03:34.709

financier.

1:03:34.792 --> 1:03:37.000

start laying off,

Every one
of those flight attendants

1:03:52.709 --> 1:03:55.167
could have walked across
the picket line, which many did.

"Hey, Vicki Frankovich,
the heck with it."

1:03:58.125 --> 1:03:59.542

kept their jobs.

1:03:59.626 --> 1:04:01.959

1:12:41.292 --> 1:12:42.834
that sells our products
exclusively

1:12:42.918 --> 1:12:45.459
through a network of people
just like you.

1:12:47.292 --> 1:12:50.042
Herbalife is a nutrition company
based in California

1:12:50.125 --> 1:12:53.626
that Carl Icahn probably
had never heard of.

1:12:53.709 --> 1:12:55.292
I mean, nothing.

1:12:55.375 --> 1:12:57.417
Until Bill Ackman showed up.

1:13:00.834 --> 1:13:02.876
Throughout my career,
the vast majority,

1:13:02.959 --> 1:13:04.959
particularly our most
successful investments,

1:13:05.042 --> 1:13:07.584
have been ones that have been
controversial in one way
or another.

1:13:07.667 --> 1:13:11.459
Bill Ackman is another one
of the major activist
investors out there.

1:13:11.542 --> 1:13:12.959
He's a fellow billionaire.

1:13:13.042 --> 1:13:15.542
One of these masters
of the universe in New York.

1:13:15.626 --> 1:13:19.000
<i>Harvard educated
versus Carl's Princeton.</i>

1:13:19.083 --> 1:13:23.000
reporter:
<i>Although unlike Carl,</i>
<i>he was born into privilege.</i>

1:13:23.083 --> 1:13:27.459
He also likes to publicly
spar with companies
the way Icahn does,

1:13:27.542 --> 1:13:29.876
but he goes about it
in a slightly different manner.

1:13:29.959 --> 1:13:31.959
<i>And please welcome
Bill Ackman.</i>

1:13:32.042 --> 1:13:36.250
(crowd applauding)

1:13:36.334 --> 1:13:38.167
<i>Okay, so we've got
a lot to cover today,</i>

1:13:38.250 --> 1:13:39.918
<i>so we're going to move
pretty quickly.</i>

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:41.626
<i>Why don't we start...</i>

1:13:41.709 --> 1:13:43.834
Sorkin:
<i>So Bill Ackman decides</i>

1:13:43.918 --> 1:13:47.375
that Herbalife effectively
is a fraud, it's a scam.

1:13:47.459 --> 1:13:50.667
<i>Herbalife is a pyramid scheme.</i>

1:13:50.751 --> 1:13:52.125
<i>It's caused enormous harm</i>

1:13:52.209 --> 1:13:54.500
<i>to millions around the world.</i>

1:13:56.417 --> 1:13:57.792
<i>Our goal is for the facts</i>

1:13:57.876 --> 1:14:00.000
<i>about Herbalife
to be made public.</i>

1:14:00.083 --> 1:14:03.542
And he believes that
if he's able to expose

1:14:03.626 --> 1:14:06.459
what he believes are the
company's frauds to the public,

1:14:06.542 --> 1:14:08.918
that regulators
are gonna jump in

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.709
and the stock is gonna tank.

1:14:10.792 --> 1:14:12.459
<i>I don't want to make
any money from this, okay?</i>

1:14:12.542 --> 1:14:14.709
<i>I view this as blood money,
but let me be clear.</i>

1:14:14.792 --> 1:14:16.292
<i>We'll short the stock.</i>

1:14:16.375 --> 1:14:18.250
<i>Herbalife stock goes down,
we make money.</i>

1:14:18.334 --> 1:14:20.167
<i>Herbalife stock goes up,
we lose money.</i>

1:14:28.584 --> 1:14:29.918
He's gonna short the company,

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000
so he's gonna bet that
the stock is gonna fall

1:14:32.083 --> 1:14:35.167
all the way to zero.

1:14:35.250 --> 1:14:38.709
Ackman:<i> A pyramid scheme is</i>
<i>actually a modern-day version</i>
<i>of a Ponzi scheme.</i>

1:14:38.792 --> 1:14:42.751
Carl, meanwhile,
is watching this all play out.

1:14:42.834 --> 1:14:45.292
Ackman:
<i>...the version is called 3.0.</i>

1:14:45.375 --> 1:14:47.792
<i>It's 1.0 is the Ponzi scheme.</i>

1:14:47.876 --> 1:14:50.584
And he's thinking to himself
that Bill is gonna lose,

1:14:50.667 --> 1:14:53.626
that he's never gonna
get the stock to go
even further down

1:14:53.709 --> 1:14:55.751
and effectively bets
against him.

1:14:55.834 --> 1:15:00.500
(discordant music plays)

1:15:00.584 --> 1:15:02.000
Carl:
<i>Ackman is a real,</i>

1:15:02.083 --> 1:15:04.125
<i>I think, a smart guy
and a good investor.</i>

1:15:04.209 --> 1:15:06.667
He might have talked himself
into believing

1:15:06.751 --> 1:15:09.167
that he was going to be
a savior,

1:15:09.250 --> 1:15:11.626
but I felt that Ackman
had an agenda.

1:15:11.709 --> 1:15:14.459
♪ ♪

1:15:14.542 --> 1:15:19.042
Icahn and Ackman
had done a deal together
some years earlier

1:15:19.125 --> 1:15:24.209
where the contract
was somewhat ambiguous.

1:15:24.292 --> 1:15:29.334
And the court eventually said
that Icahn had to pay.

1:15:29.417 --> 1:15:31.167
After Carl paid Bill,

1:15:31.250 --> 1:15:33.667
the unwritten rule
on Wall Street,

1:15:33.751 --> 1:15:36.417
"Don't gloat
about your victories."

1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:39.209
Bill went to the newspaper
and he gloated about the victory

1:15:39.292 --> 1:15:42.542
and that pissed Icahn off
like you don't know.

1:15:42.626 --> 1:15:45.125
I think Herbalife was personal.

1:15:45.209 --> 1:15:47.959
Carl:<i> Ackman's whole thesis</i>
<i>is completely wrong.</i>

1:15:48.042 --> 1:15:50.250
<i>I mean, I can't even
understand his argument.</i>

1:15:50.334 --> 1:15:53.667
I was walking through
the CNBC newsroom,

1:15:53.751 --> 1:15:57.918
and I saw Carl on TV
on another network

1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.292
absolutely annihilating Ackman.

1:16:00.375 --> 1:16:02.918
Carl:<i> He may believe what</i>
<i>he's saying, I don't know.</i>

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.751
<i>Herbalife gives jobs to people.</i>

1:16:04.834 --> 1:16:07.209
<i>I mean, it's absurd
what Ackman is saying.</i>

1:16:07.292 --> 1:16:11.042
And I stopped in my tracks
and I said,

1:16:11.125 --> 1:16:12.584
"This is unbelievable."

1:16:12.667 --> 1:16:15.918
And I was kind of mad that
it was happening somewhere else.

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.083
But I went and I called Bill.

1:16:18.167 --> 1:16:21.751
And I said, "Do you want
to respond to this?"

1:16:21.834 --> 1:16:23.250
And he's like, "You know what?

1:16:23.334 --> 1:16:24.626
"Carl's an asshole.

1:16:24.709 --> 1:16:26.500
"I'm sick and tired
of this bullshit.

1:16:26.584 --> 1:16:28.292
"He tried to take
advantage of me.

1:16:28.375 --> 1:16:31.500
I'll come on, I'll do it"
So I said, "Great."

1:16:31.584 --> 1:16:33.667
(intense music playing)

1:16:33.751 --> 1:16:35.751
Ackman:<i> Carl has been</i>
<i>maligning my reputation,</i>

1:16:35.834 --> 1:16:37.834
<i>so it's very important
that we get to the facts.</i>

1:16:37.918 --> 1:16:40.876
Ackman comes on,
we're talking about Herbalife.

1:16:40.959 --> 1:16:43.667
Ackman:<i> Carl, he can try</i>
<i>to scare my investors</i>
<i>from investing with me,</i>

1:16:43.751 --> 1:16:45.459
<i>which it sounds like
he's attempting.</i>

1:16:45.542 --> 1:16:48.834
And then Carl calls in
to the control room.

1:16:48.918 --> 1:16:51.125
I look down at my computer
and there's a tweet

1:16:51.209 --> 1:16:53.918
from a CNBC
colleague of mine,

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.334
and it says,
"This is gonna be good."

1:16:56.417 --> 1:16:58.792
-(dramatic flourish plays)
-All right, welcome back

1:16:58.876 --> 1:17:01.626
to the "Halftime Report,"
live today from
the New York Stock Exchange.

1:17:01.709 --> 1:17:04.459
We've been speaking with
hedge fund investor Bill Ackman.

1:17:04.542 --> 1:17:07.083
Now it's time to hear
what Carl Icahn thinks
of our conversation.

1:17:07.167 --> 1:17:09.792
He joins us live on the phone.
Carl, are you there,
Bill, there?

1:17:09.876 --> 1:17:12.375
-Carl:<i> Okay,</i>
<i>good to talk to you.</i>
-Ackman:<i> I am here as well.</i>

1:17:12.459 --> 1:17:14.375
Wapner: You know, Carl,
you have an issue with the way

1:17:14.459 --> 1:17:17.209
that Bill went about
the Herbalife short

1:17:17.292 --> 1:17:19.792
as aggressive and as
publicly as he did,

1:17:19.876 --> 1:17:22.667
and he's essentially saying
that you're a hypocrite.

1:17:22.751 --> 1:17:23.876
How do you respond?

1:17:23.959 --> 1:17:26.167
Carl:<i> Let's start</i>
<i>with what I want to say.</i>

1:17:26.250 --> 1:17:28.626
<i>I've really sort of had it
with this guy Ackman,</i>

1:17:28.709 --> 1:17:32.834
<i>'cause Herbalife is a classic
example of what he does.</i>

1:17:32.918 --> 1:17:34.459
<i>You scare the hell
out of people,</i>

1:17:34.542 --> 1:17:35.834
<i>get the stock down</i>

1:17:35.918 --> 1:17:38.292
<i>and make 600 million bucks
on paper</i>

1:17:38.375 --> 1:17:40.250
<i>and tells the world
how great he is.</i>

1:17:40.334 --> 1:17:41.626
<i>I had dinner with him.</i>

1:17:41.709 --> 1:17:43.292
<i>I couldn't figure out
if he was</i>

1:17:43.375 --> 1:17:45.584
<i>the most sanctimonious guy
I ever met in my life</i>

1:17:45.667 --> 1:17:47.334
<i>or the most arrogant.</i>

1:17:47.417 --> 1:17:49.751
And I'd like to give Bill
a chance to respond
to you as well.

1:17:49.834 --> 1:17:52.500
Ackman:
<i>Carl has been-- is gonna try</i>
<i>to attack my integrity.</i>

1:17:52.584 --> 1:17:55.167
<i>And Herbalife,
we're not scaring people</i>

1:17:55.250 --> 1:17:56.959
<i>but going through the facts
about the company--</i>

1:17:57.042 --> 1:17:58.834
Carl:
<i>If that wasn't scaring people,</i>
<i>you could have fooled me.</i>

1:17:58.918 --> 1:18:00.334
Ackman:
<i>And we will either</i>
<i>be proven right,</i>

1:18:00.417 --> 1:18:01.751
<i>or we'll be proven wrong.</i>

1:18:01.834 --> 1:18:03.751
There had never been
quite a showdown

1:18:03.834 --> 1:18:05.417
between two people
of such high stature

1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:08.083
as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman
on live TV.

1:18:08.167 --> 1:18:10.918
Carl:
<i>Then he talks about charity,</i>
<i>that's complete (bleep).</i>

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.751
<i>He's not giving it to charity,</i>

1:18:12.834 --> 1:18:15.042
<i>assuming they don't need
charity themselves.</i>

1:18:15.125 --> 1:18:17.250
-Let me do this, I mean...
Carl.

1:18:17.334 --> 1:18:19.542
Carl:<i> Now, that's what</i>
<i>I'll say about Ackman, okay?</i>

1:18:19.626 --> 1:18:21.751
Let me remind you that
we are on live television.

1:18:21.834 --> 1:18:24.334
We're doing the show that day
at the stock exchange,

1:18:24.417 --> 1:18:25.918
and it's on a delay.

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.042
So each time Carl would say
something nasty about Bill,

1:18:30.125 --> 1:18:33.083
two seconds later
you would hear all the traders
on the trading floor...

1:18:33.167 --> 1:18:35.626
Carl:
<i>He's the quintessential</i>
<i>example on Wall Street,</i>

1:18:35.709 --> 1:18:37.500
<i>if you want a friend,
get a dog.</i>

1:18:37.584 --> 1:18:40.417
-traders: Ohh!
-Carl:<i> And he does</i>
<i>a pump-and-dump...</i>

1:18:40.500 --> 1:18:41.876
Wapner: Uh, the guys
on the trading floor

1:18:41.959 --> 1:18:43.459
down here at
the New York stock exchange...

1:18:43.542 --> 1:18:47.042
Same thing when Bill would,
you know, insult Carl,

1:18:47.125 --> 1:18:48.918
the floor would erupt.

1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.459
Ackman:<i> This is not</i>
<i>an honest guy.</i>
<i>He's a bully, okay?</i>

1:18:51.542 --> 1:18:53.834
<i>Says he doesn't like
behaviors that are bad...</i>

1:18:53.918 --> 1:18:59.042
It quickly devolved
into a battle, a war.

1:18:59.125 --> 1:19:02.042
-Carl:<i> Ackman is a liar, okay?</i>
-(traders clamoring)

1:19:02.125 --> 1:19:06.083
<i>He's got one of the worst
reputations on Wall Street.
The guy is a major loser.</i>

1:19:06.167 --> 1:19:09.417
Ackman:<i> The big issue about</i>
<i>Carl Icahn is he's not used</i>
<i>to someone standing up to him.</i>

1:19:09.500 --> 1:19:12.375
<i>Carl, you wanna bid
for the company, go ahead
and bid for the company.</i>

1:19:12.459 --> 1:19:14.751
Carl:<i> Hey, you don't have</i>
<i>to tell me what I'm free to do.</i>

1:19:14.834 --> 1:19:17.500
I'm reporting from Davos,
Switzerland,

1:19:17.584 --> 1:19:20.000
<i>at the World Economic Forum,</i>

1:19:20.083 --> 1:19:23.667
<i>where all the CEOs
from around the globe come.</i>

1:19:23.751 --> 1:19:26.042
And I remember being
at a cocktail party,

1:19:26.125 --> 1:19:31.334
trying to get Wi-Fi on my phone
so I could watch it,

1:19:31.417 --> 1:19:35.334
and literally a swarm of CEOs

1:19:35.417 --> 1:19:37.459
standing around,
we were all watching...

1:19:37.542 --> 1:19:40.792
Carl:<i> I appreciate, Bill,</i>
<i>that you called me</i>
<i>a great investor.</i>

1:19:40.876 --> 1:19:43.250
<i>Unfortunately I can't
say the same for you.</i>

1:19:43.334 --> 1:19:45.792
It was like must-see TV.

1:19:45.876 --> 1:19:48.751
Ackman:<i> Simply said to him,</i>
<i>I said, "Look, Carl,</i>
<i>you are no friend of mine."</i>

1:19:48.834 --> 1:19:50.459
You couldn't take
your eyes off of the thing.

1:19:50.542 --> 1:19:52.459
Ackman:<i> Do you think</i>
<i>I wanna invest with you?</i>

1:19:52.542 --> 1:19:55.709
Carl:<i> I wouldn't invest</i>
<i>with you if you were</i>
<i>the last man on Earth.</i>

1:19:55.792 --> 1:19:58.709
Volume of trading
at the New York Stock Exchange

1:19:58.792 --> 1:20:00.375
went down 20%,

1:20:00.459 --> 1:20:04.042
as everybody was just sort of
standing there watching TV.

1:20:04.125 --> 1:20:06.459
Carl:<i> I'm telling you,</i>
<i>he's like the crybaby</i>
<i>in the schoolyard.</i>

1:20:06.542 --> 1:20:08.417
<i>You know, I went to
a tough school in Queens</i>

1:20:08.500 --> 1:20:11.334
<i>and they used to beat up
the little Jewish boys</i>

1:20:11.417 --> 1:20:13.417
<i>and he was like one
of these little Jewish boys,</i>

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:16.000
<i>crying that the world
was taking advantage of him.</i>

1:20:16.083 --> 1:20:18.834
Wapner:
Let me, guys, we're gonna...
we're gonna end it there.

1:20:18.918 --> 1:20:22.250
Bill Ackman, Carl Icahn,
we'll go to break.

1:20:22.334 --> 1:20:24.834
Herbalife played out
for a number of years,

1:20:24.918 --> 1:20:27.792
but it was really a foregone
conclusion from that moment,

1:20:27.876 --> 1:20:30.209
because once Carl emerged,

1:20:30.292 --> 1:20:31.834
Bill didn't really have
a chance.

1:20:31.918 --> 1:20:33.918
Just as the markets are falling,

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.751
Herbalife is hitting
an all-time high today.

1:20:36.834 --> 1:20:38.918
Carl wasn't going
to go anywhere.

1:20:39.042 --> 1:20:41.542
And Wall Street
was betting with Carl.

1:20:41.626 --> 1:20:43.709
(trance music playing)

1:20:46.459 --> 1:20:48.751
Herbalife is officially

1:20:48.834 --> 1:20:51.751
the worst investment ever made
by Pershing Square.

1:20:56.459 --> 1:21:00.417
Bill lost the majority of
his investment in Herbalife.

1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:02.167
It was a billion-dollar short.

1:21:02.250 --> 1:21:04.542
And eventually Bill
just threw in the towel,

1:21:04.626 --> 1:21:08.250
and Icahn, he won.

1:21:11.626 --> 1:21:12.792
It obviously felt good.

1:21:12.876 --> 1:21:14.459
It felt good that I beat him.

1:21:14.542 --> 1:21:19.083
We did have a vendetta, and I
felt he had screwed me once,

1:21:19.167 --> 1:21:21.125
so it felt good to do it.

that Brett will be coming back?"

1:31:21.876 --> 1:31:24.876

"You know, we've been trying
to negotiate a deal."

approaching this negotiation

"This is great."

1:40:40.626 --> 1:40:42.542
"I can build a terrace."
And my mother comes home,

1:40:42.626 --> 1:40:44.500
says, "What is that?"
I say,

1:40:44.584 --> 1:40:47.709
"They're bricks, Ma.
I got bricks for you
to build your terrace."

1:40:47.792 --> 1:40:50.000
And she says, "We can't steal.

1:40:50.083 --> 1:40:51.959
That is wrong."

1:40:52.042 --> 1:40:53.959
I said, "You cut the bullshit."

1:40:54.042 --> 1:40:56.709
I said, "You, first of all,
you keep talking about

1:40:56.792 --> 1:40:59.250
you hate these builders, they're
all making too much money."

1:40:59.334 --> 1:41:01.500
And she goes,
"Don't talk to me like that."

1:41:01.584 --> 1:41:04.250
And my father says,
"Hey, who's gonna miss 'em?

1:41:04.334 --> 1:41:06.000
They're not gonna miss 'em."

1:41:06.083 --> 1:41:10.083
"Yeah... I guess they weren't
gonna use them anyway."

1:41:10.167 --> 1:41:13.083
And we, "Here's the bricks,"
and we took 'em out.
That was it.

1:41:13.167 --> 1:41:14.792
I just, I'll never forget that.
