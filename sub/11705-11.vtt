WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.545
{\an8}- WE'LL TYPE
AN ANONYMOUS LETTER.

00:03.628 --> 00:06.506
{\an8}"RON MADE OUT WITH TWO GIRLS.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.341
{\an8}THEREFORE YOU SHOULD KNOW
THE TRUTH."

00:08.425 --> 00:09.467
{\an8}- THIS IS GONNA BE SO BAD.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.428
{\an8}- I FOUND THIS.
YOU ASKED FOR HER NUMBER?

00:11.511 --> 00:14.431
{\an8}- I GOT HER NUMBER, YES.
- [bleep] YOU.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.598
{\an8}- WHO WROTE THE NOTE?
YOU TWO.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.308
{\an8}- DID YOU GROW SOME BALLS
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

00:17.392 --> 00:18.727
{\an8}- FUNNY HOW PEOPLE
BECOME [bleep].

00:18.810 --> 00:20.562
{\an8}- I'M IN YOUR [bleep] FACE
RIGHT NOW!

00:20.645 --> 00:23.189
{\an8}- I'M IN YOUR [bleep] FACE TOO!
- [yells]

00:23.273 --> 00:25.859
{\an8}- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
ABOUT ANYBODY IN THIS HOUSE.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.111
{\an8}- OKAY.
HOLD MY EARRINGS, PLEASE.

00:28.194 --> 00:31.406
{\an8}- AH! OH, OH, OH!
- BRING IT ON, BITCH.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.116
{\an8}- [laughs]

00:33.199 --> 00:35.785
{\an8}- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS HAVE NO HEARTS.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.620
{\an8}- GET OUT OF HERE.
- PEACE OUT, FAKE PEOPLE.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.708
{\an8}- BYE.
- YOU'RE A [bleep] LOSER.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.817
{\an8}- WAKE UP THIS MORNING,
IT'S LIKE...

01:07.901 --> 01:10.445
{\an8}[exhales] IT'S LIKE A WEIGHT
OFF EVERYONE'S SHOULDERS.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.031
{\an8}THE BAD AURA
IN OUR HOUSE IS FINALLY GONE.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.741
{\an8}- LET'S--LET'S GET THAT BED
OUT OF THAT ROOM

01:14.824 --> 01:16.993
{\an8}SO SHE CAN'T COME BACK IN HERE.

01:17.076 --> 01:18.536
{\an8}- [laughs]
- LET'S GET IT OUT OF HERE.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.913
{\an8}LET'S PUT IT OUTSIDE.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.373
{\an8}- THE ONLY THING LEFT
IS HER DIRTY, DISGUSTING BED.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.126
{\an8}SO MIKE AND I DECIDE
TO GET IT OUT OF OUR ROOM.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.252
{\an8}[mutters]

01:26.336 --> 01:28.755
{\an8}- YO, SHE'S SO BIG, DOG,
SHE BROKE THE BED, DOG.

01:28.838 --> 01:32.884
{\an8}- I SEEN THAT.
- OH, YEAH.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.303
{\an8}- REARRANGING THE ROOM!
OH, YEAH!

01:35.386 --> 01:37.680
{\an8}GONNA GET BUSTED.
MIKE!

01:37.764 --> 01:39.516
{\an8}- WHAT?
- GET ONE END OF THIS!

01:39.599 --> 01:44.395
{\an8}- DON'T WORRY.
OH, YEAH. GO YOUR WAY.

01:44.479 --> 01:49.734
{\an8}GO THAT WAY.
OH, YEAH. GO YOUR WAY.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.028
{\an8}GO THAT WAY.
TO THE--NO, THE OTHER WAY, DOG.

01:52.111 --> 01:53.696
{\an8}WE GOT A SITUATION.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.199
{\an8}WE GOT TO COME OUT
WITH THAT SIDE FIRST.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.535
{\an8}GO STRAIGHT INTO THE BATHROOM
WITH THAT JOINT.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.205
{\an8}LEFT. NO, NO, THE OTHER WAY.
- I'M STUCK.

02:02.288 --> 02:06.209
{\an8}- WAIT, BRING IT BACK OUT.
NOW ROTATE IT THIS WAY.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.044
{\an8}[bleep]
CAN WE JIMMY IT OUT?

02:08.127 --> 02:10.045
{\an8}OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.632
{\an8}[loud banging]
IT'S WORKING.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.009
{\an8}[metal clanging]

02:15.093 --> 02:18.555
{\an8}- WE WANT EVERY SINGLE THING
OUT OF THE ROOM.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.349
{\an8}OH, WOW.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.394
{\an8}THERE YOU GO, GIRL.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.146
{\an8}ANGELINA'S BED'S OUT OF HERE.
WE GOT ALL THIS EXTRA SPACE.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.440
{\an8}WE CAN BRING GIRLS IN HERE.
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT NOW.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.901
{\an8}OH, BRO, WE GOT SOME SHOES
TO THROW OUT.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.069
{\an8}- GUESS WHAT.
YOU LEFT.

02:33.152 --> 02:37.574
{\an8}YOUR STUFF'S
IN THE GARBAGE, GIRL.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.616
{\an8}[car alarm rings]

02:38.700 --> 02:40.201
{\an8}- OH, THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN
A PROBLEM.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.494
{\an8}[laughter]

02:41.578 --> 02:42.537
{\an8}SOMEBODY'S FERRARI.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.747
{\an8}YO, WE CAN WORK OUT
IN THIS ROOM NOW.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.504
{\an8}- YOU GOT THE WATER?

02:51.588 --> 02:53.423
{\an8}- OOH, SMELLS LIKE LOBSTERS.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.549
{\an8}ARE THEY ALIVE?

02:54.632 --> 02:55.508
{\an8}- WE'RE COOKING
SOME LOBSTERS TONIGHT.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.927
{\an8}THIS IS A MEAL
TO CELEBRATE THE FAMILY

02:58.011 --> 02:59.304
{\an8}AND, UH, ANGELINA LEAVING.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.222
{\an8}- THEY'RE [bleep] ALIVE.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.849
{\an8}- DON'T FREAK ME OUT.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.935
{\an8}- [screams]
STOP!

03:06.019 --> 03:08.104
{\an8}- EVERY SINGLE THING
THAT SNOOKI EATS

03:08.187 --> 03:09.606
{\an8}IS LIVING AT ONE POINT.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.107
{\an8}SO IT JUST MAKES ME LAUGH

03:11.190 --> 03:13.109
{\an8}THAT SHE'S NOT GONNA EAT LOBSTER
BECAUSE IT'S LIVING.

03:13.192 --> 03:15.320
{\an8}DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
- LET'S SAVE THEM.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.988
{\an8}- DO YOU KNOW IF THEY PUT
ELASTIC BANDS AROUND MY CLAWS?

03:17.071 --> 03:18.072
{\an8}- WHERE ARE WE GONNA PUT THEM?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.616
{\an8}- ME AND JENNI DECIDED TO SAVE

03:19.699 --> 03:20.909
{\an8}ONE OF THE LOBSTERS

03:20.992 --> 03:22.577
{\an8}SO JENNI GETS A BOWL
OF WATER.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.455
{\an8}SHE BRINGS IT INTO THE ROOM.
WE'LL KEEP IT AS A PET.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.958
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW,
WE'LL FEED IT AND SAVE IT.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.168
{\an8}I'M NOT SURE
WHAT LOBSTERS EAT.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.086
{\an8}BUT I THINK THEY EAT,
LIKE, INSECTS OR SOMETHING.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.632
{\an8}SO I WAS GONNA FEED THEM,
LIKE, WORMS.

03:35.715 --> 03:39.844
{\an8}- YOU GRAB ONE SIDE,
I GRAB THE OTHER.

03:39.928 --> 03:44.140
{\an8}[both scream]

03:44.223 --> 03:46.059
{\an8}- [gasps] OH, NO.
IT'S UPSIDE DOWN.

03:46.142 --> 03:49.228
{\an8}- HE'S GONNA DROWN.
- THEY LIVE IN WATER.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.814
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?
- WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE IT.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.524
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SAVE IT, BROO.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.485
{\an8}- IT GOES IN SALT WATER,
YOU IDIOT.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.362
{\an8}- OH, TAKE HIM OUT!
- WELL, TAKE HIM OUT!

03:57.445 --> 03:58.029
{\an8}- SOMETHING THAT LIVES
IN SALT WATER,

03:58.112 --> 03:58.863
{\an8}YOU PUT IN FRESHWATER,

03:58.947 --> 04:00.949
{\an8}IT'S GONNA KILL IT

04:01.032 --> 04:02.241
{\an8}FASTER THAN WE WERE GONNA
KILL IT.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.534
{\an8}- WE WANT TO NAME HIM CHARLIE.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.495
{\an8}- WELL, CHARLIE'S DEAD!
CHARLIE'S DEAD!

04:05.578 --> 04:07.288
{\an8}- STOP IT!
- CHARLIE'S FREAKING DEAD NOW!

04:07.372 --> 04:11.709
{\an8}- WHAAAH. WE TRIED.
- SNOOK, YOU WANT TO PUT IT IN?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.044
{\an8}- NO.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.880
{\an8}- MIKE, IT SMELLS DELICIOUS,
LIKE ALWAYS.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.966
{\an8}- TIME TO EAT!

04:18.048 --> 04:22.136
{\an8}EVERYBODY
TO THE DINNER TABLE!

04:22.220 --> 04:23.638
{\an8}- JENNI, WANT TO SAY GRACE?

04:23.721 --> 04:25.723
{\an8}- I KNOW, RIGHT?
RIGHT AFTER ANGELINA LEAVES.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.686
{\an8}WE'RE THANKFUL THAT, UH,
THERE'S STILL SEVEN OF US LEFT.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.104
{\an8}WHAT ELSE?

04:31.187 --> 04:32.814
{\an8}AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU KNOW,

04:32.897 --> 04:34.732
{\an8}NO MATTER WHAT PROBLEMS
THAT WE HAVE, WE'RE TOGETHER.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.150
{\an8}- WE'RE A FAMILY.
I THINK WE'RE CLOSER.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.193
{\an8}- I'M CLOSER.
- I'M VERY HAPPY.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.195
{\an8}- SO TO OUR FIRST
REAL FAMILY DINNER.

04:39.278 --> 04:40.405
{\an8}- YAY.
- YAY.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.198
{\an8}- LITTLE CELEBRATION.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.033
{\an8}- OH, YEAH.
CHAMPAGNE, YEAH.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.370
{\an8}OH, YEAH!
- YAY!

04:47.453 --> 04:48.705
{\an8}- OH!

04:48.788 --> 04:50.248
{\an8}- THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
FOR ANGELINA.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.709
{\an8}- I WAS KIND OF WORKING
ON A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGELINA,

04:52.792 --> 04:54.085
{\an8}UM, TO BE HER FRIEND.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.420
{\an8}BUT, LIKE,
NOW THAT SHE'S GONE,

04:55.503 --> 04:57.547
{\an8}I'M ON MY OWN COMPLETELY.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.841
{\an8}AND IT SUCKS,
BECAUSE NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO,

04:59.924 --> 05:01.217
{\an8}BE UP RON'S ASS ALL THE TIME?

05:01.300 --> 05:02.343
{\an8}LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.972
{\an8}WHAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DO?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

05:06.055 --> 05:06.889
{\an8}- CHEERS.
- CHEERS TO FAMILY.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.225
{\an8}- THE REAL FAMILY.

05:09.308 --> 05:11.227
{\an8}- [speaking gibberish]

05:11.310 --> 05:14.439
{\an8}- AH, AMELIA.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.773
{\an8}- SUCH A SHAME.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.568
{\an8}- GOING "JACUZZING."
- YEAH. YEAH, I'M GONNA COME.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.902
{\an8}- HOW COME I CAN'T COME?
- OH, YEAH!

05:19.986 --> 05:22.405
{\an8}IN THE JACUZZI, YEAH!

05:22.488 --> 05:25.199
{\an8}- LITTLE HOMOSEXUAL--
THREE GUYS IN A HOT TUB.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.576
{\an8}[laughter]

05:26.659 --> 05:27.994
{\an8}- SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT SAM?

05:28.077 --> 05:28.995
{\an8}- I DON'T LIKE HER.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.204
{\an8}BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE--

05:30.288 --> 05:32.248
{\an8}- SINCE, LIKE, THE BAD BITCH
IS OUT OF THE HOUSE,

05:32.331 --> 05:33.708
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE WE'RE
A FAMILY AGAIN.

05:33.791 --> 05:36.252
{\an8}DON'T YOU WANT TO SQUASH IT?
'CAUSE I DO.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.712
{\an8}- I DO, AND I DON'T.

05:37.795 --> 05:38.921
{\an8}ME PUTTING MY NECK OUT
ON THE LINE FOR SAM,

05:39.005 --> 05:43.092
{\an8}AND SHE, LIKE, BASICALLY
SMACKED ME IN MY FACE OVER IT.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.970
{\an8}WHY? 'CAUSE I WROTE YOU A NOTE
ABOUT WHAT YOUR BOYFRIEND DID?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.930
{\an8}- SO DO YOU WANT TO TALK
TO HER?

05:48.014 --> 05:49.432
{\an8}- TONIGHT? NOW?
- COME ON.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.101
{\an8}I JUST DON'T LIKE
PEOPLE THAT I LOVE

05:52.185 --> 05:53.394
{\an8}TO BE FIGHTING.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.896
{\an8}AND JENNI, SHE PRETTY MUCH
DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING

05:54.979 --> 05:56.814
{\an8}TO DO WITH THE GIRL.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.107
{\an8}SHE'S LIKE,
"JUST DROP IT."

05:58.191 --> 06:00.318
{\an8}SO OBVIOUSLY,
I NEED TO TALK TO SAM MYSELF.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.239
{\an8}I KIND OF WANT TO TALK
TO YOU.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.534
{\an8}- ABOUT WHAT?
- THE NOTE.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.161
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT TO COME TALK TO ME
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

06:10.244 --> 06:13.081
{\an8}- YEAH, IF YOU WANT.
- YEAH.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.923
{\an8}OKAY.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.300
{\an8}- SO, LIKE,
THE WHOLE NOTE DEAL,

06:24.383 --> 06:25.802
{\an8}I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.345
{\an8}OBVIOUSLY, IT RUINED
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.888
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.641
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD FRIEND TO YOU.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.059
{\an8}AND IT'S SAD
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.185
{\an8}- I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.938
{\an8}- I APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYTHING.
IT WAS STUPID.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.440
{\an8}I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON
FROM IT, IF YOU DO.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.566
{\an8}- WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING UP TO ME.

06:40.650 --> 06:44.821
{\an8}UM, I ACTUALLY, LIKE,
ENJOY MY TIME WITH YOU.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.510
{\an8}- [sighs]

07:07.593 --> 07:11.347
{\an8}[laughter and cheers]

07:14.559 --> 07:17.186
{\an8}- SAM DIDN'T EVEN
ACKNOWLEDGE ME.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.938
{\an8}SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.
SHE'S NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

07:19.021 --> 07:24.652
{\an8}IT'S VERY AWKWARD.
AND I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.113
{\an8}- I WILL NOT TALK TO JENNI.
I WILL NOT LOOK AT HER

07:27.196 --> 07:28.030
{\an8}IN THE FACE--
SHE GROSSES ME OUT.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.867
{\an8}I WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT GIRL.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.544
{\an8}- I HAVE TWO HOT-ASS GIRLS
COMING TO THE HOUSE.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.337
{\an8}AND THEN I HAVE RAMONA,

07:43.421 --> 07:44.547
{\an8}THE GIRL THAT'S BEEN STANDING
ME UP, FINALLY AT THE HOUSE.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.925
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL
AM I GONNA DO?"

07:48.009 --> 07:51.554
{\an8}- I DECIDE WHEN WE'RE GONNA
LEAVE THE CLUB, AND THAT'S IT.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.400
{\an8}[laughter and cheers]

08:15.203 --> 08:17.413
{\an8}- LIKE, WHAT WE HAD
BEFORE THE FIGHT,

08:17.496 --> 08:19.332
{\an8}I THINK WAS AMAZING.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.959
{\an8}- IT WAS FUN.
I HAD FUN WITH YOU GUYS, BUT...

08:25.171 --> 08:27.089
{\an8}- SOMETHING I THINK I NEVER
DONE BEFORE IN MY LIFE

08:27.173 --> 08:31.928
{\an8}IS, LIKE, CHEW MY PRIDE BACK
AND APOLOGIZE.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.263
{\an8}SO I AM SORRY, SAM.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.847
{\an8}- UM, THANK YOU.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.933
{\an8}I DON'T THINK JENNI'S APOLOGY
WAS SINCERE.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.727
{\an8}IT TOOK HER FIVE WEEKS
TO SAY SOMETHING TO ME,

08:39.809 --> 08:42.688
{\an8}AND SHE KIND OF WAS JUST, LIKE,
"UH, I DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS,

08:42.772 --> 08:44.440
{\an8}BUT I'M SORRY."

08:44.524 --> 08:46.108
{\an8}- IT WAS ALL ANGELINA.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.443
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WITHOUT HER HERE,

08:47.526 --> 08:50.821
{\an8}I THINK THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE
WOULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.699
{\an8}- BUT NOW THAT SHE'S NOT HERE,
WE CAN HAVE GIRL TIME AGAIN.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.789
{\an8}NO?
- WELL, BABY STEPS.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.791
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH I SAID MY PIECE
TO SAM,

{\an8}BUT IT WORKS
IN MY BENEFIT 100%,

22:19.755 --> 22:21.631
{\an8}'CAUSE THE GIRLS SEE
HOW NICE I AM

22:21.715 --> 22:23.759
{\an8}AND HOW SMOOTH I AM.

ABOUT ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF.

{\an8}AND HE JUST WANTS TO DO
HIS OWN THING

22:48.408 --> 22:50.535
{\an8}WHEN HE WANTS TO
ON HIS OWN TIME.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.330

IT'S HARD TO EVEN TALK TO HER.

{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
AN ATTITUDE

23:24.820 --> 23:26.613

{\an8}- HERE WE GO AGAIN.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.042
{\an8}THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL
WE'RE LEAVING.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.356
{\an8}- SNOOKS DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A
RIGHT TO BE MAD AT ME.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.362
{\an8}I'M JUST ROUNDING UP EVERYBODY
LIKE I NORMALLY DO.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.072
{\an8}SHE KNOWS THIS IS WHAT I DO.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.491
{\an8}BUT SNOOKI'S DRUNK,
AND SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.705
{\an8}YO, PAULY, LET'S GO.

24:18.373 --> 24:20.542
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE [bleep]

{\an8}WE NEED MORE [bleep] ALCOHOL.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.174
{\an8}DO YOU WANT
TO GO THE ALCOHOL SHOP?

30:01.257 --> 30:03.092
{\an8}- YES.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.512
{\an8}BYE!

30:05.595 --> 30:06.387
{\an8}OH, IT'S STILL LIGHT OUT.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.348
{\an8}I THOUGHT
IT WAS [bleep] DARK.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.561
{\an8}ORANGE JUICE,
HAWAIIAN PUNCH...

30:13.645 --> 30:15.396
{\an8}- THIS ISN'T ALCOHOL.
WHAT WERE WE TRYING TO MAKE?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.398
{\an8}WHAT IS THIS?

30:17.482 --> 30:19.609
{\an8}- BUT THEN YOU NEED RUM.
- SO GET RUM.

30:19.692 --> 30:20.902
{\an8}THANK YOU! OY.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.570
{\an8}WAIT, LET ME FIX
MY BUTT CHEEKS.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.740
{\an8}- YOU LOOKING GOOD, GIRL.

30:25.823 --> 30:29.619
{\an8}- WHERE ARE WE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:29.702 --> 30:30.954
{\an8}- OH, [bleep].
- HEY.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.163
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

30:32.247 --> 30:33.915
{\an8}YO, WE'RE GONNA GO
TO KLUTCH TONIGHT.

30:33.998 --> 30:34.958
{\an8}- YEAH, I KNOW.

30:35.041 --> 30:35.667
{\an8}- I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT, BABY.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.835
{\an8}NOW NOBODY'S DRUNK.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.255
{\an8}- NO, THERE NEEDS TO BE
A BIGGER TALK THAN THAT.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.589
{\an8}I NEED MORE THAN A "SORRY."

30:41.673 --> 30:43.883
{\an8}I NEED, LIKE, A CONVERSATION,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

30:43.967 --> 30:46.427
{\an8}"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

30:46.511 --> 30:47.762
{\an8}WHAT THE [bleep] IS WRONG
WITH YOU?"

30:47.845 --> 30:50.306
{\an8}- I GOT YOU.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.517
{\an8}- AT LEAST HE KNOWS
HE WAS WRONG.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.768
{\an8}STILL GOT TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT IT.

30:53.851 --> 30:55.270
{\an8}I'M REALLY PISSED OFF.

30:55.353 --> 30:58.439
{\an8}AND MAYBE I WILL TAKE
THAT APOLOGY, OR I WON'T.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.651
{\an8}YEAH, I DON'T TAKE APOLOGIES
LIKE THAT.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.069
{\an8}SORRY.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.321
{\an8}- SNOOKI IS A DRAMA QUEEN.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.156
{\an8}SHE LIKES TO GET CODDLED.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.658
{\an8}AND I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

31:08.741 --> 31:09.951
{\an8}- JUST NOT SAYING YOU'RE SORRY
IS GONNA FIX IT.

31:10.034 --> 31:13.288
{\an8}YOU STARTED THE FIGHT,
SO GET UP AND, YOU KNOW,

31:13.371 --> 31:17.041
{\an8}MAKE--MAKE THE MOOD HAPPY AGAIN,
BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.301
{\an8}- VINNY'S GIRL IS ONE
OF THE HOTTEST GIRLS

31:26.384 --> 31:27.927
{\an8}I'VE SEEN IN MIAMI,
DEFINITELY.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.681
{\an8}YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE A CHICK
LIKE THAT BY HERSELF.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.726
{\an8}- "MY [bleep] BEST FRIEND
IS HERE

31:34.809 --> 31:35.476
{\an8}"AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO [bleep] LEAVE?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.979
{\an8}ARE YOU SERIOUS?"

31:38.062 --> 31:40.064
{\an8}I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS KID
EVER AGAIN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.655
{\an8}- FOUR CUPS OF ICE.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.781
{\an8}- TELL ME WHEN.
- OKAY, BABE.

31:48.865 --> 31:53.244
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE EXCITED.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.413
{\an8}[gasps] LET'S MAKE A REALLY GOOD
DESIGN ON THE BOARD.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.749
{\an8}- OKAY.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.001
{\an8}EW, THAT'S TOO SMALL!
DO IT BIGGER!

32:00.084 --> 32:01.210
{\an8}- THAT'S HOW SMALL YOU ARE.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.170
{\an8}LOOK AT YOUR POOF
AT YOUR GOGGLES.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.715
{\an8}- SKINNY DRESS.
THAT LOOKS LIKE PAULY.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.925
{\an8}- HE'S, LIKE, THIS.
MM, MM, MM.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.260

32:09.344 --> 32:10.845
{\an8}LIKE, HE HAS BIG, LIKE,
UPPER ARMS,

32:10.928 --> 32:14.557
{\an8}BUT, LIKE, NO, LIKE, BODY.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.184
{\an8}- NO, THAT'S HIS HAND
ON YOUR BUTT.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.519
{\an8}[both laughing]

32:18.603 --> 32:20.938
{\an8}- RYDER DREW EVERYONE.
IT WAS SO, SO FUNNY.

32:21.022 --> 32:24.025
{\an8}JENNI LOOKS LIKE JENNI.
OH, MY GOD.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.193
{\an8}OH, MY GOD.
IT WAS PERFECT.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.361
{\an8}CHEERS, LOVE YOU.

32:26.444 --> 32:30.448
{\an8}- WHAT'D YOU PUT IN IT?

32:30.531 --> 32:31.532
{\an8}- EW.

32:36.954 --> 32:40.249
{\an8}- KISSING MY OWN MUSCLES.
[chuckles]

32:40.333 --> 32:41.376
{\an8}- EW. LOOK HOW THEY MADE
MY LEGS.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.710
{\an8}EW.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.003
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT TO BRING HOME
BOYS TONIGHT?

32:44.087 --> 32:45.546
{\an8}LAST NIGHT WAS
THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.090
{\an8}- I HAVE NO WORDS.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.050
{\an8}[both laughing]
- OH, YEAH!

32:49.133 --> 32:50.343
{\an8}SO ME AND RYDER

32:50.426 --> 32:51.886
{\an8}WANT TO JUST FORGET ABOUT IT,
GO TO THE [bleep] CLUB,

32:51.969 --> 32:54.764
{\an8}AND DANCE
AND, LIKE, GO CRAZY.

32:54.847 --> 32:56.683
{\an8}- SO, SAM, WE'RE GOING
TO THE CLUB TONIGHT.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.434
{\an8}SO WHAT DO YOU DO
TO GET READY?

32:58.518 --> 33:00.103
{\an8}DO YOU MASTURBATE BEFORE?
- DO YOU?

33:00.186 --> 33:01.187
{\an8}- NO.
- ME EITHER.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.397
{\an8}- OKAY.
- ANYWAY.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.440
{\an8}- FEEL HER BOOBS.
DID YOU FEEL HER BOOBS YET?

33:04.524 --> 33:06.651
{\an8}THEN FEEL YOURS.

33:06.734 --> 33:09.278
{\an8}WHAH!

33:09.362 --> 33:11.781
{\an8}- I LIKE MY LITTLE BOOBS.
- I LIKE HER BOOBS.

33:11.864 --> 33:16.285
{\an8}- MY LITTLE BABY BOOBS.
[chuckles]

33:16.369 --> 33:18.413
{\an8}- HELLO.
PALACE OF LOVE.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.457
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, NO PROBLEM.
BYE.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.793
{\an8}THE CABS ARE HERE!
THE CABS ARE HERE!

33:23.876 --> 33:24.961
{\an8}- LET'S GO.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.838
{\an8}- T-SHIRT TIME!

33:26.921 --> 33:29.215
{\an8}- I DON'T FEEL
LIKE I LOOK NICE.

33:29.298 --> 33:30.049
{\an8}- SHUT UP.

33:40.059 --> 33:43.730
{\an8}- WE'RE ALL DANCING
AND HAVING A GOOD TIME,

33:43.813 --> 33:45.732
{\an8}FIST PUMPING.

33:45.815 --> 33:49.944
{\an8}SNOOKI AND RYDER AND JENNI
ARE DANCING ON TOP OF TABLES.

33:50.027 --> 33:52.405
{\an8}BUT EVERYONE'S TOGETHER.
IT FEELS GREAT.

33:57.034 --> 34:02.331
{\an8}AND RAMONA SHOWED UP.
SCENE GETS A LOT BETTER.

34:04.292 --> 34:07.795
{\an8}- YO, VINNY'S GIRL
IS LOOKING SMOKING.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.797
{\an8}THIS IS ONE
OF THE HOTTEST GIRLS

34:09.880 --> 34:11.757
{\an8}I'VE SEEN IN MIAMI,
DEFINITELY.

34:11.841 --> 34:15.178
{\an8}YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE A CHICK
LIKE THAT BY HERSELF.

34:16.637 --> 34:20.224
{\an8}EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M A PIMP.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S HOW IT IS.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.143
{\an8}MY GRANDPAPPY WAS A PIMP.
HIS GRANDPAPPY WAS A PIMP.

34:23.226 --> 34:27.106
{\an8}SO I'M ABOUT TO GET
TO BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.860
{\an8}- I SEE MIKE TALKING
TO RAMONA.

34:31.944 --> 34:32.945
{\an8}AND HE KIND OF, LIKE, PULLS
A LITTLE BIT OF THE ROBBERY.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.697
{\an8}I WOULD NEVER DO
THAT TO MY DUDE VINNY.

35:06.395 --> 35:11.192
{\an8}- I'M WORRIED THAT MIKE
WILL STRAIGHT UP GRAB THIS GIRL

35:11.275 --> 35:13.986
{\an8}AND, LIKE, KISS HER
JUST TO BE THE MAN,

35:14.070 --> 35:14.695
{\an8}BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS
HOOKING UP WITH THE SAME GIRLS

35:14.779 --> 35:16.823
{\an8}I'M HOOKING UP WITH.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.199
{\an8}HAPPENED IN JERSEY.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.912
{\an8}IT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE.

35:26.457 --> 35:31.128
{\an8}MIKE MIGHT HAVE A SECRET
POSSIBLE OBSESSION WITH ME.

35:36.759 --> 35:38.845
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

35:38.928 --> 35:39.929
{\an8}- ME AND PAULY
ARE STARING AT MIKE

35:40.012 --> 35:43.266
{\an8}STARE HARD
AT, LIKE, RAMONA

35:43.349 --> 35:44.267
{\an8}AND--AND VINNY

35:44.350 --> 35:46.227
{\an8}AND JUST, LIKE, GETTING
REALLY ANGRY.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.770
{\an8}I'VE NEVER SEEN MIKE LIKE THAT.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.063
{\an8}AND I THINK HE WAS JUST,
LIKE, REALLY HATING

35:49.146 --> 35:53.317
{\an8}THAT EVERYONE WAS HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.410
{\an8}- SNOOKI IS BEING SNOOKI.
SHE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.245
{\an8}SHE'S DANCING. RYDER'S DANCING.
JENNI'S DANCING.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.706
{\an8}LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.249
{\an8}AND SITUATION'S
JUST SITTING THERE

36:08.332 --> 36:10.251
{\an8}WITH NO CHICK,
AND HE'S WATCHING THE SHOW.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.439
{\an8}- OBVIOUSLY,
MIKE'S NOT GETTING GIRLS,

36:31.522 --> 36:32.690
{\an8}SO WHAT DOES HE WANT TO DO?

36:32.773 --> 36:33.941
{\an8}HE COMES OVER TO ME
AND STARTS TO KISS ME.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.444
{\an8}AND I KIND OF PUSHED HIM BACK,
AND I WAS, LIKE, "UGH."

36:36.527 --> 36:37.945
{\an8}HIS MAIN GOAL
IS TO GET GIRLS,

36:38.029 --> 36:39.530
{\an8}AND WHEN
HE DOESN'T HAVE GIRLS,

36:39.614 --> 36:41.115
{\an8}HE'S A VERY,
VERY DIFFERENT PERSON.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.869
{\an8}HE'S MEAN, AND HE JUST WANTS
TO GO HOME AND GO TO BED.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.954
{\an8}HERE WE GO AGAIN.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.165
{\an8}HE'S LIKE, "WE GOT TO GO."
HE'S LIKE, "WE'RE LEAVING."

36:49.248 --> 36:52.585
{\an8}THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL
WE'RE LEAVING.

36:52.668 --> 36:56.088
{\an8}AND THEN HE SLAPS ME
IN THE MOUTH.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.392
{\an8}- I'M, LIKE, THE LEADER
OF THIS GROUP.

37:08.476 --> 37:09.977
{\an8}I'M THE [bleep] DADDY
OF THIS HOUSE.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.270
{\an8}I SAY WHAT GOES.

37:11.354 --> 37:15.149
{\an8}AND IF I SAY WE'RE LEAVING,
WE'RE LEAVING.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.186
{\an8}- DON'T [bleep] SLAP ME
IN THE FACE

37:52.269 --> 37:53.771
{\an8}AND TELL ME
THAT I NEED TO GO HOME.

38:00.653 --> 38:04.156
{\an8}- IF SOMEBODY GRABBED MY FACE,
I WOULD LISTEN THE FIRST TIME.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.325
{\an8}AND I WOULD BE LIKE, "I'M EITHER
LEAVING, OR I'M STAYING."

38:06.409 --> 38:07.326
{\an8}NOT, LIKE, EHHH.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.027
{\an8}- MIKE USED TO BE REALLY COOL.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.029
{\an8}RECENTLY, HE'S NOT HIMSELF.

38:43.112 --> 38:45.406
{\an8}HE'S BEEN, LIKE, A CREEP.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.742
{\an8}AND I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO BE HANGING AROUND WITH HIM.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.080
{\an8}- I KIND OF FEEL BAD
FOR SNOOKI.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.166
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SITCH'S PROBLEM IS.

38:55.249 --> 38:56.542
{\an8}HE'S JUST BEING NEGATIVE
AND BEING SOUR.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.253
{\an8}AND HE'S NOT FUN TO BE AROUND
WHEN HE'S LIKE THAT.

38:59.336 --> 39:00.337
{\an8}- SO WHY DON'T YOU GO
BACK INSIDE?

39:00.421 --> 39:02.089
{\an8}- BECAUSE HE WILL SMACK YOU
IN THE FACE.

39:02.173 --> 39:06.844
{\an8}HE DOESN'T CARE
WHO YOU ARE.

39:06.927 --> 39:07.887
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
WITH MIKE LATELY.

39:07.970 --> 39:10.222
{\an8}LIKE, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
HE'S JUST, LIKE,

39:10.306 --> 39:11.348
{\an8}JUST ON THE EDGE.

39:11.432 --> 39:14.685
{\an8}NO PATIENCE WHATSOEVER
FOR ANYBODY ELSE.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.193
{\an8}- JUST BECAUSE
HE CAN'T GET NO [bleep]

39:22.276 --> 39:24.236
{\an8}DOESN'T MEAN HE HAS TO [bleep]
TELL US ALL TO LEAVE.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.571
{\an8}- [bleep] YELL AT ME

39:25.654 --> 39:27.073
{\an8}WHEN I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME
WITH MY BEST FRIEND!

39:27.156 --> 39:29.366
{\an8}MY [bleep] BEST FRIEND
IS HERE,

39:29.450 --> 39:31.035
{\an8}AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO [bleep] LEAVE?

39:31.118 --> 39:32.244
{\an8}ARE YOU SERIOUS?
ARE YOU [bleep] SERIOUS?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.413
{\an8}- MIKE IS GETTING
ON OUR NERVES.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.123
{\an8}AND HE IS GETTING OVERWHELMING.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.625
{\an8}HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN TO SHUT UP.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.210
{\an8}AND HE TAKES THINGS
TOO FAR.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.712
{\an8}WE ALL SEEN IT. WE ALL HEARD IT.
AND WE'RE ALL TIRED OF IT.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.214
{\an8}- "I'M GONNA [bleep] YOU UP.
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]."

39:43.297 --> 39:45.299
{\an8}- GO BACK IN.
[bleep] HIM.

39:45.382 --> 39:47.093
{\an8}- IF I SEE HIM,
I'M GONNA [bleep] HIM UP.
