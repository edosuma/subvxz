00:27.800 --> 00:34.988
My bird is missing.

00:36.855 --> 00:39.224
It's "I lost my canary."

00:39.225 --> 00:42.218
And try telling it to the
woman in the cafe upstairs.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.923
I, uh...

01:19.639 --> 01:22.035
I've lost my canary.

01:22.036 --> 01:24.536
You should have clipped its wings.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.125
It's weird.

01:27.126 --> 01:28.538
Are you cold?

01:28.539 --> 01:30.235
I'm kind of cold.

01:30.236 --> 01:32.736
It's probably nerves. It's
not like I've ever sto--

01:40.964 --> 01:43.625
Now, can I see my money?

01:43.763 --> 01:46.263
As soon as you show me the weapon.

01:46.484 --> 01:50.576
Yeah, um... funny thing about that.

01:51.134 --> 01:52.871
The weapon...

01:52.872 --> 01:55.372
might take a little while.

01:55.462 --> 01:57.962
Only way I could smuggle it out.

01:59.877 --> 02:02.377
I swallowed it.

02:31.184 --> 02:32.648
Uh, we have company.

02:32.649 --> 02:35.013
Single white male
downstairs at the back.

02:35.014 --> 02:36.601
What? What's wrong?

02:36.602 --> 02:38.733
You didn't follow our
safety protocols, did you?

02:38.734 --> 02:41.680
What? Of course I did. Why wouldn't I?

02:41.773 --> 02:44.273
You were followed.

02:47.025 --> 02:48.681
I've got second white male.

02:48.682 --> 02:50.193
I see another two.

02:50.194 --> 02:52.418
Strike that. Three more.

02:52.419 --> 02:53.262
Going to plan "B."

02:53.263 --> 02:55.763
- What's plan "B"?
- Come on!

03:12.844 --> 03:15.344
Come on, come on.

03:33.328 --> 03:34.221
I can't make it.

03:34.222 --> 03:36.722
You don't have a choice.

03:41.408 --> 03:43.908
Anybody got a twenty on the last guy?

03:57.913 --> 04:00.413
Come on.

05:07.032 --> 05:08.947
Hey.

05:08.948 --> 05:11.448
Hey.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.023
God, you look awful.

05:18.024 --> 05:19.534
Thank you.

05:19.535 --> 05:22.035
Good morning.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.837
You all right?

05:24.838 --> 05:27.338
Yeah. You know.

05:28.407 --> 05:31.163
It's not every day you see a guy
shattered into a million pieces.

05:32.468 --> 05:34.968
Yeah.

05:35.041 --> 05:40.657
Two weeks ago, the CIA was contacted by
an American ex-patriot named Derek Modell.

05:41.124 --> 05:44.259
Mr. Modell, for reasons more
pecuniary than patriotic,

05:44.397 --> 05:49.281
stole a sample of a new biological
agent from an arms dealer in Montenegro.

05:49.419 --> 05:53.605
He called it Ice 5, and offered
it to the agency for $10,000.

05:53.697 --> 05:54.257
As you know,

05:54.258 --> 05:57.823
Mr. Modell failed to comply with any
number of safety protocols we'd outlined,

05:57.916 --> 06:00.575
and he was flowed and killed before
the exchange could be completed.

06:00.621 --> 06:03.661
Killed? He exploded
like a frozen piñata.

06:03.847 --> 06:08.127
We believe his death was caused by this
biological agent he was transporting.

06:08.220 --> 06:11.309
Are you saying this stuff turned
Modell into a human popsicle?

06:11.634 --> 06:12.859
Uh...

06:12.860 --> 06:17.903
if I may, I might be able to --
if you're all curious -- elucidate.

06:18.043 --> 06:20.250
Well, we know that this guy Modell,

06:20.251 --> 06:23.816
he swallowed the sample to smuggle
it out, kind of like a drug mule.

06:23.908 --> 06:25.417
Based on some tests,

06:25.418 --> 06:29.794
we found the sample in
this medical container.

06:29.933 --> 06:31.730
It was found in the
van amongst the, uh...

06:31.731 --> 06:32.997
Chunks.

06:32.998 --> 06:35.498
Yeah. Chunks.

06:38.203 --> 06:40.374
This was not meant to be swallowed.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.891
It probably started leaking as
soon as it got into his stomach.

06:42.983 --> 06:44.923
And then when he was tackled, bam!

06:44.924 --> 06:47.388
Complete rupture. Instant O.D.

06:47.389 --> 06:50.383
When you say "instant O.D."
You mean it instantly froze him?

06:50.521 --> 06:53.991
Well, not exactly. It didn't really
freeze him as much as freeze-dry him.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.107
It crystallized him in seconds.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.616
So the mission was a bust.

06:58.617 --> 06:59.795
So to speak.

06:59.796 --> 07:01.022
Now this man Derek Modell

07:01.023 --> 07:05.349
spent the last nine months as a relief
worker at the hospital Sava in Montenegro.

07:05.536 --> 07:08.766
We believe that ice 5 is
being covertly developed there

07:08.860 --> 07:10.829
by a man named Fintan Keene.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.437
I haven't heard that name in a while.

07:12.438 --> 07:15.050
That's because Mr. Keene
claims to have gone legitimate.

07:15.142 --> 07:18.135
Seems to be all the
rage among evil geniuses.

07:18.415 --> 07:20.915
Fintan Keene is wanted
by just about everybody.

07:20.928 --> 07:22.677
But he's protected.

07:22.678 --> 07:25.433
He runs his arms and
drug op out of Montenegro,

07:25.525 --> 07:28.089
taking advantage of its
political instability.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.932
You want us to take down Keene.

07:29.933 --> 07:33.736
The director simply wants us to
obtain a viable sample of Ice 5.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.007
So, Sydney, we're
sending you into Montenegro

07:36.008 --> 07:38.810
as a relief worker for the
U.K. branch of OMNIFAM.

07:38.903 --> 07:41.403
I want you to understand this
is not a tactical mission.

07:41.743 --> 07:45.051
We go in, obtain the
Ice 5, and come out.

07:45.518 --> 07:48.655
I don't want anybody else getting this
before we do. That's all. Good luck.

07:58.456 --> 08:00.956
Is something on your mind, agent Vaughn?

08:01.329 --> 08:03.829
No. Not really.

08:07.925 --> 08:10.425
I'm not sleeping very well.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.720
It's Lauren, isn't it?

08:14.689 --> 08:17.300
I think I see her sometimes. Or...

08:18.373 --> 08:23.033
I thought I saw her in
the market in Algeria.

08:23.219 --> 08:25.160
That ever happen with you?

08:25.161 --> 08:27.661
Do I have visions of Lauren?

08:28.780 --> 08:31.820
I don't know that many people who
killed the woman they were married to.

08:31.913 --> 08:34.091
I was just wondering
if that's what happens.

08:34.092 --> 08:36.160
It did.

08:36.162 --> 08:38.662
Now it doesn't.

08:45.888 --> 08:47.828
I'm taking the last of the toothpaste.

08:47.829 --> 08:50.329
It's  okay. I'm going
to the store later.

08:50.892 --> 08:54.790
Do you know how excited I am that I'm
not the only one going to the store?

08:56.423 --> 08:57.837
Do  you need anything?

08:57.838 --> 09:00.338
No, I'm good, thanks.

09:05.192 --> 09:07.547
You mind if I...

09:07.548 --> 09:10.048
No, go ahead.

09:15.352 --> 09:17.852
Are these our mother?

09:18.879 --> 09:20.437
There was a fire.

09:20.438 --> 09:22.521
I lost all the pictures I had of her.

09:22.522 --> 09:25.706
So I asked my dad if he
had any, and he found those.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.858
The only one she hadn't thrown out.

09:30.497 --> 09:32.428
Is this you?

09:32.429 --> 09:34.929
I don't know who the baby is.

09:35.344 --> 09:37.844
I've never seen pictures
of her like this.

09:38.416 --> 09:40.916
Just the official stuff.

09:42.602 --> 09:45.102
I haven't seen much.

09:47.747 --> 09:50.247
It's Vaughn.

09:50.842 --> 09:52.186
Be safe.

09:52.187 --> 09:54.687
You too.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.841
I hope you're not squeamish.

10:16.842 --> 10:20.263
From time to time, they send me a
squeamish one. It never ends well.

10:20.356 --> 10:21.200
I'm not squeamish,

10:21.201 --> 10:24.051
though most of my relief work with
OMNIFAM has been administrative.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.117
We'll fix that. Have you
patching folks up in no time.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.149
You're a doctor?

10:28.150 --> 10:32.955
Nurse by training, doctor,
janitor, and babysitter by default.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.322
Sounds overwhelming.

10:34.323 --> 10:37.317
Nothing a bit of bushmills and
a few "Hail Marys" can't cure.

10:40.910 --> 10:42.757
Phoenix is in play.

10:42.758 --> 10:43.600
Copy that.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.101
I know it's too risky, but I wish
she was wearing a transmitter.

10:46.164 --> 10:48.664
She will once they trust her.

10:48.946 --> 10:52.512
Besides, it'll give you a chance to brush
up on some of your old-school tricks.

10:53.024 --> 10:55.731
Hey, a little respect for your elders.

10:55.918 --> 10:58.191
No, I'm not happy.

10:58.192 --> 11:02.044
You promised we'd have the test tube kits
two days ago, and we're still waiting.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.815
Tell you what.

11:06.816 --> 11:11.240
Our cafeteria lucked into about
20 crates of fresh strawberries.

11:11.847 --> 11:14.504
You have my kits here by dawn tomorrow,

11:14.644 --> 11:18.971
and I'll cut you in for half the fruit.

11:20.691 --> 11:23.191
Yeah, fresh as in...

11:23.762 --> 11:26.332
not old or frozen.

11:27.634 --> 11:29.139
You're amazing.

11:29.140 --> 11:31.640
Thank you.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.903
Okay then.

11:39.704 --> 11:42.412
There's more work than we can
do, so you need to pace yourself.

11:42.505 --> 11:44.063
Be quick, but don't hurry.

11:44.064 --> 11:46.564
I've gone through nine relief
workers in the past six weeks.

11:46.672 --> 11:47.946
I'd hate to lose another.

11:47.947 --> 11:49.839
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.787
That, Madame, is what they
all say. Let's find out.

11:56.074 --> 11:58.971
Poor old guy suffers from
psoriatic arthropathy.

11:59.157 --> 12:02.532
He needs to be greased from head to toe.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.757
Welcome aboard.

12:08.384 --> 12:10.467
There's no way I'd eat this. No way.

12:10.468 --> 12:13.509
My kid would. Mitchell?
He would eat anything.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.594
He's already been to
the emergency room twice.

12:16.780 --> 12:18.482
He swallowed a quarter and a car.

12:18.483 --> 12:22.238
But not a real car, ‘cause,
you know, I mean -- well, huge.

12:22.610 --> 12:24.644
- He's beautiful.
- Yeah, thanks.

12:24.645 --> 12:27.256
I got a million of these pictures.
I probably should update them.

12:27.769 --> 12:30.269
You like that one? There's a
funny story behind that, actually.

12:30.328 --> 12:32.822
I gotta warn you right now, Nadia's
immune to your cute baby story charm.

12:32.823 --> 12:35.310
I'm not so sure.

12:35.311 --> 12:37.490
Do you have any weaponizing
scenarios for Ice 5?

12:37.491 --> 12:39.670
The three obvious forms
are liquid, powder, and gas,

12:39.671 --> 12:41.163
but it really depends on a few things.

12:41.164 --> 12:44.234
Difficulty of manufacturing,
stability, intended use.

12:44.327 --> 12:47.034
Right. I mean, is it
designed for an evil empire

12:47.127 --> 12:49.738
that wants to dump it in the water
supply and freeze-dry an entire city,

12:49.832 --> 12:52.444
or, you know, maybe for
just one crazy assassin guy?

12:52.582 --> 12:54.094
Put a couple drops on
a hollow-tip bullet --

12:54.095 --> 12:55.226
Either, it's a hot ticket.

12:55.227 --> 12:57.548
We should target major players --
governments, large terrorist cells.

12:57.549 --> 12:59.441
Then offer it for sale ourselves.

12:59.442 --> 13:01.575
See who might be shopping
for designer bioweapons.

13:01.576 --> 13:02.394
Right. I'll put a list together.

13:02.395 --> 13:04.895
You're married.

13:32.357 --> 13:34.012
What are you doing in here?

13:34.013 --> 13:35.667
We're almost out of syringes.

13:35.668 --> 13:38.168
I was searching for a purchase order.

13:54.285 --> 13:56.080
What can I do?

13:56.081 --> 13:58.581
Prayers  never hurt.

14:02.304 --> 14:03.461
What happened to him?

14:03.462 --> 14:05.962
I don't know.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.397
What did he say?

14:11.398 --> 14:13.898
Car accident.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.488
- We can handle it from here.
- I don't mind helping.

14:30.489 --> 14:32.569
If you want to last
here, you'll do as I say.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.088
Get back to that supply room
and finish what you were doing.

14:35.226 --> 14:37.726
This area's off limits.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.306
You can eliminate both the KTL

14:52.399 --> 14:55.394
and the African global party from
your list of potential Ice 5 buyers.

14:55.532 --> 14:56.663
It's out of their league.

14:56.664 --> 14:58.076
Everyone else seems good.

14:58.077 --> 15:00.419
Thanks.

15:00.420 --> 15:02.791
Jack?

15:02.792 --> 15:05.355
I was wondering if you
knew who this baby is.

15:07.316 --> 15:09.476
Where did you get this?

15:09.477 --> 15:11.692
Oh, it's Sydney's.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.413
She  gave this to you?

15:13.414 --> 15:14.354
I found it.

15:14.355 --> 15:16.200
I was hoping you might
be able to tell me --

15:16.201 --> 15:18.701
There's nothing to tell.

15:20.313 --> 15:24.242
Sorry to, uh, interrupt. We
got the uplink from Montenegro.

15:29.703 --> 15:33.315
A soldier came in presenting the same
frozen symptoms we saw in Algeria.

15:33.454 --> 15:37.019
He was taken to a secure wing of the
hospital by a nurse named Kiera MacLaine.

15:37.345 --> 15:40.528
That's M-a-c
capital L-a-i-n-e.

15:40.621 --> 15:42.542
She said she was from Glasgow.

15:42.543 --> 15:45.252
- Is MacLaine imbedded with Keene?
- We don't know yet,

15:45.343 --> 15:48.099
but Sydney said MacLaine definitely
recognized the effects of Ice 5.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.511
She's still at the hospital
trying to learn more.

15:50.512 --> 15:52.879
There's a strong military
presence at the hospital,

15:52.880 --> 15:55.444
but it seems to be in support of
the staff. Nothing we can't handle.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.959
Okay, MacLaine seems to be clean.
Registered nurse, no criminal record.

15:59.098 --> 16:02.187
For the last nine years, she's worked
for relief agencies around the world.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.170
We know Keene gives
cash to the hospital.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.446
Maybe she takes care
of his men in exchange.

16:06.447 --> 16:08.193
What do you know about this secure wing?

16:08.194 --> 16:09.659
We think it's the research lab.

16:09.660 --> 16:12.366
Blueprints indicate several
interconnected rooms in the large ward.

16:12.506 --> 16:15.118
The entrance is protected
by a swipe card and a keypad.

16:15.192 --> 16:16.227
We already have the access code,

16:16.228 --> 16:18.728
but we need that card,
which we'll get off MacLaine.

16:22.989 --> 16:25.600
Come on, man, it's got
to look real. Do it again.

16:25.788 --> 16:27.108
Vaughn, I hit you.

16:27.109 --> 16:29.609
Yeah, like a girl. Just
hit me again. Come on.

16:35.686 --> 16:36.673
One more time.

16:36.674 --> 16:39.332
You can do better than
that. Come on. One more time.

16:45.267 --> 16:47.295
Damn it! Watch it!

16:47.296 --> 16:49.046
What are you doing?

16:49.047 --> 16:51.547
- Sorry, father.
- Just trying to help.

16:51.654 --> 16:53.162
Let me take a look at that.

16:53.163 --> 16:55.663
Maybe I should watch, see how you do it.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.376
I was going to sew
it shut right there --

16:58.469 --> 16:59.789
- Ah! Stop that.
- Sorry.

16:59.790 --> 17:02.290
Go! I'll look after him.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.680
Sorry. She's new. A bit eager.

17:22.364 --> 17:25.692
I can't help but notice the fine
cologne you're wearing, father.

17:27.090 --> 17:29.591
Glenlivet, if I'm not mistaken.

17:29.599 --> 17:32.099
- Is it that bad?
- Not at all.

17:34.113 --> 17:36.963
Come here. I'll finish
you up in the office.

17:58.951 --> 18:03.660
It's a pretty nasty cut. Mind
telling me how you got it?

18:04.546 --> 18:07.046
Someone didn't like my last sermon.

18:08.487 --> 18:11.003
Well, I've known a priest or two.

18:11.564 --> 18:13.636
That sounds rather ominous.

18:13.637 --> 18:16.137
But none that get into bar fights.

18:17.502 --> 18:20.002
Well, I see my reputation precedes me.

18:21.311 --> 18:22.770
I'm father Michael Lacott.

18:22.771 --> 18:24.892
I'm new here at St. Cyrus.

18:24.893 --> 18:29.268
Kiera MacLaine. Good
to know you. I think.

18:29.594 --> 18:31.058
I should also mention I

18:31.059 --> 18:34.720
hear confession every week day
from 4:00 to 6:00 at tavern Nikolai.

18:35.092 --> 18:37.943
Why does that not surprise me?

18:41.769 --> 18:45.382
When's the last time you went
to confession, Kiera MacLaine?

18:49.724 --> 18:52.133
I'm  not sure how I'm supposed to feel.

18:52.134 --> 18:54.177
About what?

18:54.178 --> 18:56.678
A flirty priest.

18:57.656 --> 19:00.316
I assure you my
intentions are honorable.

19:01.949 --> 19:04.449
Mostly.

19:12.993 --> 19:15.493
You're not what I expected.

19:17.626 --> 19:18.710
Is that your way of saying

19:18.711 --> 19:22.468
"what's a nice catholic girl
doing in a hellhole like this?"

19:23.586 --> 19:25.646
Same as you.

19:25.647 --> 19:29.308
- I was sent here for my sins.
- It's not that bad.

19:32.249 --> 19:35.957
Fintan. What are you doing here?

19:36.077 --> 19:38.017
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

19:38.018 --> 19:41.155
She's not real happy
with me of late, father.

19:41.790 --> 19:43.202
I see.

19:43.203 --> 19:44.522
You two are married?

19:44.523 --> 19:48.851
No. Your good book would
frown up on that, wouldn't it?

19:59.122 --> 20:01.536
- We had an agreement.
- We do.

20:01.537 --> 20:03.906
But one of my men had
a wee accident today.

20:03.907 --> 20:06.407
I thought I'd spin by, pay my respects.

20:06.607 --> 20:09.410
You treated him, right?
So how's he doing?

20:09.503 --> 20:11.998
I think you know.

20:11.999 --> 20:14.518
You should be nicer to your big brother.

20:14.936 --> 20:16.591
Isn't that what the Bible says?

20:16.592 --> 20:19.092
What, do I look like
some kind of an expert?

20:19.246 --> 20:23.144
Don't worry, Kiera. I'll be
out of your way soon enough.

20:37.243 --> 20:40.334
Your brother seems like a
nice enough guy. What's he do?

20:40.706 --> 20:43.206
You must be new here.

22:11.712 --> 22:14.658
Not only has Keene developed
Ice 5, he's testing it on humans.

22:14.798 --> 22:16.595
I saw a roomful of test subjects.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.821
I'm more concerned by the
pressurized canisters.

22:18.822 --> 22:21.625
It means Keene's found a
way to make it airborne.

22:21.764 --> 22:24.106
Here are the photos Sydney took.

22:24.107 --> 22:26.479
I thought the tanks were full
of propane or liquid nitrogen.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.086
Then I saw the Cyrillic stencil.

22:28.087 --> 22:31.319
Ice 5 released into a city-- the damage
could be in the tens of thousands.

22:31.412 --> 22:32.780
How many tanks in the lab?

22:32.781 --> 22:33.987
I'd say 14.

22:33.988 --> 22:36.166
We found a buyer in Damascus.
That's what they're expecting.

22:36.167 --> 22:38.585
And they want it fast.
Less than 48 hours.

22:38.586 --> 22:39.953
We have to shut Keene down.

22:39.954 --> 22:42.179
I don't disagree, but
you lack the manpower.

22:42.180 --> 22:43.833
You aren't a tactical squad.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.684
We can do it without a fight.
We can use Kiera MacLaine.

22:47.103 --> 22:50.193
After we learned she was Keene's
sister, we re-ran her info.

22:50.425 --> 22:52.925
Her real name is Meghan Keene.

22:52.985 --> 22:55.400
She's former IRA, as is her brother.

22:55.401 --> 22:57.771
They were involved in several
bombings in the early '90s,

22:57.772 --> 23:00.622
including one that killed
a father and two boys.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.943
But MacLaine's conflicted.
Has issues with her brother.

23:02.944 --> 23:04.169
We think we can turn her.

23:04.170 --> 23:06.445
She's the one person who
could get Keene alone,

23:06.446 --> 23:07.480
away from his men.

23:07.481 --> 23:10.855
It could give us a chance to grab him
without a fight, shut down the lab.

23:10.948 --> 23:13.561
Have you determined how
to approach MacLaine?

23:13.654 --> 23:16.791
Yeah. In confession.

23:31.802 --> 23:34.302
Thank you.

24:00.070 --> 24:02.874
I'll have another one of
these for my parishioner.

24:07.214 --> 24:09.714
I don't know what I'm doing here.

24:09.715 --> 24:12.215
I'm glad you came.

24:12.432 --> 24:14.932
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:23.186 --> 24:26.227
- Is it that bad?
- Is what that bad?

24:26.599 --> 24:29.099
I don't know. You tell me.

24:32.878 --> 24:35.729
I supposed I'm feeling a bit... trapped.

24:36.661 --> 24:39.161
At the hospital?

24:39.288 --> 24:40.809
Yeah.

24:40.810 --> 24:43.310
Trapped by your brother?

24:44.429 --> 24:47.612
I do this for a living.
Not the drinking.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.394
And it doesn't take a priest to notice

24:50.395 --> 24:52.895
how angry you were when
you saw him yesterday.

24:53.792 --> 24:59.743
It's complicated. "Love
the sinner, hate the sin."

25:00.022 --> 25:02.101
Isn't that what they say?

25:02.102 --> 25:04.602
Something like that.

25:06.563 --> 25:09.842
A long time ago, he saved me.

25:11.474 --> 25:13.166
I owe him.

25:13.167 --> 25:15.667
But he scares you.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.282
You don't know Fintan.

25:20.384 --> 25:22.884
He's done some awful things.

25:25.465 --> 25:27.965
We both have, I suppose.

25:30.023 --> 25:32.523
You could always leave.

25:35.013 --> 25:38.006
Like I said, you don't know my brother.

25:39.220 --> 25:41.141
He can do it.

25:41.142 --> 25:43.202
He can turn her.

25:43.203 --> 25:45.703
I know what it's like to feel trapped,

25:46.173 --> 25:49.453
to have a past you despise,
that you can't escape.

25:50.712 --> 25:53.212
We all have secrets, Kiera.

25:56.935 --> 25:59.435
I was married --
for a short time.

26:00.687 --> 26:02.709
That being your secret?

26:02.710 --> 26:06.038
That being a part of it.

26:06.177 --> 26:09.933
Now, obviously it was
before I had the collar.

26:11.239 --> 26:13.739
The woman I was married to betrayed me.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.906
She betrayed a lot of people.

26:18.593 --> 26:21.093
And when I found out what she'd done,

26:22.066 --> 26:25.584
I let my hate for her consume me.

26:26.564 --> 26:32.846
And I began to wish the
woman I loved was dead.

26:34.806 --> 26:40.136
I woke up every day
imagining how I'd do it.

26:40.415 --> 26:42.403
What was the best way.

26:42.404 --> 26:44.904
What was the most efficient way.

26:45.891 --> 26:48.391
I mean, it's all I wanted.

26:55.121 --> 26:59.831
That woman was evil, and
deserved to be punished,

26:59.905 --> 27:02.405
so I killed her.

27:04.179 --> 27:08.125
And although that woman
was the worst kind of evil,

27:08.917 --> 27:12.818
I also know that killing her was wrong.

27:18.372 --> 27:20.872
I don't sleep
much. I --

27:22.467 --> 27:25.175
I mean, I can't close my eyes

27:26.888 --> 27:28.550
without seeing it.

27:28.551 --> 27:32.357
That --
that moment.

27:35.576 --> 27:38.076
That look on her face.

27:39.424 --> 27:41.924
She won't leave me.

27:42.533 --> 27:45.033
She won't.

27:56.781 --> 27:59.726
Forgiveness is a tricky thing, isn't it?

28:02.059 --> 28:04.958
Even God can't do it
if you won't let him.

28:09.628 --> 28:14.987
I've never been able to say
no to him -- to my brother.

28:15.499 --> 28:18.445
I'm not alone in that, but...

28:19.331 --> 28:21.831
it's my shame.

28:23.563 --> 28:26.510
It's the one thing I
can't forgive myself for.

28:28.376 --> 28:32.467
I understand what it feels
like to wish someone was...

28:39.002 --> 28:41.502
I just wish there was a way out.

28:46.766 --> 28:49.266
There are other ways

28:49.353 --> 28:52.966
to keep him from having power
over you, to make him go away.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.493
You underestimate my brother.

28:56.881 --> 28:59.381
Or maybe you underestimate me.

29:01.444 --> 29:05.391
I know it doesn't feel
like it, but you can leave.

29:08.284 --> 29:11.231
- What are you --
- You deserve another chance.

29:13.845 --> 29:16.345
I can't even think about
doing something like that.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.906
Why not?

29:20.246 --> 29:22.301
When?

29:22.302 --> 29:24.802
Tonight.

29:33.181 --> 29:35.681
- Here.
- Just --

29:35.902 --> 29:39.391
Freight manifests from
our contact in Damascus.

29:39.650 --> 29:42.795
Thank you. And that?

29:43.353 --> 29:46.013
I thought you might know
something about the picture.

29:46.665 --> 29:49.165
Who the baby was.

29:56.389 --> 29:59.765
Yeah. Well...

30:07.747 --> 30:11.552
Your mother was a very
private person, Nadia.

30:11.737 --> 30:14.683
And as you know, my
relationship with her was...

30:17.717 --> 30:20.217
brief.

30:20.382 --> 30:21.559
That's okay.

30:21.560 --> 30:24.060
I just thought maybe
you'd seen it before.

30:36.751 --> 30:39.251
Thanks.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.802
What are you?

31:01.803 --> 31:03.296
S.A.S.?

31:03.297 --> 31:04.712
MI-5?

31:04.713 --> 31:07.467
I meant what I said. I can
make your brother go away.

31:09.661 --> 31:14.037
Well, whoever you are, you're sweet.

31:14.689 --> 31:17.189
Kiera, I need you to listen.

31:17.191 --> 31:18.798
Whatever your brother's done in the past

31:18.799 --> 31:21.299
pales to what he's doing now.

31:22.430 --> 31:23.560
I wouldn't know --

31:23.561 --> 31:25.311
Yes, you do. You've seen it.

31:25.312 --> 31:27.682
You know he's been testing
it on your own patients.

31:27.683 --> 31:29.293
I have nothing to do with that.

31:29.294 --> 31:30.949
You're a party to it. That's enough.

31:30.950 --> 31:31.986
There's nothing I can do about that.

31:31.987 --> 31:34.837
Thousands of people will die
if you don't say no to him now.

31:35.442 --> 31:38.246
Do you want that on your conscience?
Could you ever forgive yourself?

31:40.298 --> 31:42.798
Who do you work for?

31:42.940 --> 31:45.552
You've been afraid of
your brother for too long.

31:45.785 --> 31:48.777
Help me, and I swear I will protect you.

31:52.839 --> 31:55.339
I can't wait to hear the details.

32:03.757 --> 32:07.305
Did you really think my
sister would betray me

32:07.444 --> 32:11.964
for you after everything
she and I have been through?

32:12.197 --> 32:14.697
Nothing really surprises me anymore.

32:14.822 --> 32:17.322
You'll discover that isn't true.

32:20.459 --> 32:23.740
You know, the trouble with
Ice 5 in its liquid form

32:24.718 --> 32:27.218
is it's too unstable.

32:28.148 --> 32:30.648
It's too hard to mass-produce.

32:32.192 --> 32:34.692
I've made people drink it, breathe it.

32:35.216 --> 32:38.066
I've applied it topically.
I've mixed it into food.

32:38.299 --> 32:40.799
The one thing I've never tried, though,

32:41.643 --> 32:44.206
is to inject it directly into the brain.

32:47.567 --> 32:50.371
Mainly because it's not cost-effective.

32:53.170 --> 32:55.012
I think you should do it.

32:55.013 --> 32:57.513
It's your fault he's here.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.107
You hate him. You hate what he does.

33:14.108 --> 33:15.603
Shut up.

33:15.604 --> 33:17.724
I could have helped you.

33:17.725 --> 33:19.417
I would have.

33:19.418 --> 33:21.483
My sister may look like an angel,

33:21.484 --> 33:25.097
but her heart is as
black as yours and mine.

33:25.189 --> 33:26.933
I don't believe that.

33:26.934 --> 33:28.586
I know you want out.

33:28.587 --> 33:31.247
Everything I told you was
true. I can still help you.

33:31.574 --> 33:33.179
You know it. You can feel it.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.680
Show this fool he's wrong.

33:38.773 --> 33:40.620
Inject it into his eye.

33:40.621 --> 33:43.121
I want you to be the last thing he sees.

34:02.137 --> 34:05.511
I don't know how you got in here,
little girl, but it was a big mistake.

35:05.399 --> 35:07.899
For...give --

35:08.462 --> 35:12.503
- Forgive...
- Kiera...

35:13.389 --> 35:16.239
You know I'm not really
a priest. I can't do that.

35:17.125 --> 35:19.322
No.

35:19.323 --> 35:21.528
I --

35:21.529 --> 35:24.029
I forgive --

35:25.959 --> 35:28.907
I forgive you.

36:10.834 --> 36:13.352
Fintan Keene's in custody and
the Ice 5 has been acquired.

36:13.724 --> 36:16.623
Sydney's safe. Our whole team made it.

36:16.763 --> 36:19.263
Good. Thank you.

36:20.162 --> 36:22.662
May I see that photograph?

36:41.000 --> 36:45.425
Irina told me years ago that this is
a picture of her holding her niece.

36:46.685 --> 36:49.725
She told me that holding this
baby filled her with a longing and

36:49.819 --> 36:52.526
a hope to have children of her own.

36:55.795 --> 36:58.549
The next day, I asked Irina to marry me.

36:59.248 --> 37:02.814
I wanted my child to be loved
like the baby in this photograph.

37:06.641 --> 37:09.141
Of course her story could
have been a total fabrication.

37:11.069 --> 37:14.139
Another one of her countless
lies designed to draw me in.

37:15.725 --> 37:18.576
But I choose to believe
it was the truth.

37:21.284 --> 37:25.469
When we had Sydney, Irina held
her in this exact same way.

37:27.055 --> 37:30.145
And I can only imagine that
she did the same with you.

37:34.112 --> 37:36.612
So, for me,

37:37.546 --> 37:40.046
I choose to believe.

37:43.314 --> 37:48.168
Well, then I suppose each of us needs
to find our own sense of closure.

38:42.658 --> 38:46.604
Listening to you talk to that woman...

38:51.992 --> 38:54.492
I know.

38:58.351 --> 39:05.683
I just wanted you to know you
can talk to me whenever you want.

39:08.811 --> 39:11.311
Thanks.

39:16.661 --> 39:20.132
When we get back, maybe
you should spend the night.

39:28.444 --> 39:30.944
Vaughn?

39:45.844 --> 39:45.845
