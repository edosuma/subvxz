WEBVTT

00:08.960 --> 00:11.440
Come on. Follow me this way.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.130
Come and see the elephant.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.969
Okay, I have questions.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.842
You never said we could travel
into parallel worlds.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.325
Not a parallel world.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.566
But that's London?

00:32.960 --> 00:33.961
Our London.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.323
We're on the Thames,
the last great Frost Fair, 1814.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.567
February the fourth.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.761
Hang on.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.889
Why aren't we home?
Can't you steer this thing?

00:41.960 --> 00:44.486
I told you, you don't steer the TARDIS,
you reason with it.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.767
- How?
- Unsuccessfully, most of the time.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.844
She's a bad girl, this one.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.605
Always looking for trouble.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.480
Oh.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.843
Last day before the thaw.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.521
Thought I'd better find
a more reliable parking spot.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.484
Wait, you want to go out there?

01:10.640 --> 01:12.404
- You don't?
- It's 1814.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.885
Melanin.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.531
- Yes?
- Slavery is still totally a thing.

01:19.720 --> 01:20.801
Yes, so it is.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.928
It might be, like, dangerous out there.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.644
Definitely it's dangerous.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.565
So how do we stay out of trouble?

01:26.640 --> 01:28.483
Well, I'm not the right person to ask.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.121
Okay, when you go somewhere dangerous,
what do you take?

01:31.520 --> 01:33.522
First on the left, second right,

01:33.640 --> 01:35.927
under the stairs, past the bins,
fifth door on the left.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.645
- What's there?
- The wardrobe.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.841
Pick a dress.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.965
So the TARDIS has dresses
and likes a bit of trouble?

01:43.280 --> 01:44.486
Yeah, I think I'm low key
enough for that.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.126
Me too.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.841
Watch out, sir. Whoa!

02:52.680 --> 02:54.808
Doesn't anyone notice the TARDIS?

02:54.960 --> 02:56.769
Your species
hardly notices anything.

03:04.840 --> 03:05.966
So, what are the rules?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.401
Rules?

03:07.480 --> 03:08.606
Yeah.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.607
Travelling to the past,
there's got to be rules.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.087
If I step on a butterfly,
it could send ripples through time that,

03:14.160 --> 03:16.606
I mean, I'm not even born in the first
place and I could just disappear.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.523
Definitely. I mean,
that's what happened to Pete.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.002
- Pete?
- Your friend, Pete.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.089
He was standing there, a moment ago,

03:23.160 --> 03:25.561
but he stepped on a butterfly.
Now you don't even remember him.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.487
Shut up.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.325
- I'm being serious.
- Yeah, so was Pete.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.845
You know what I mean.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.804
Every choice I make in this moment,

03:34.920 --> 03:37.605
here and now,
could change the whole future.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.966
Exactly like every other
day of your life.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.003
The only thing to do is
to stop worrying about it.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.766
Mmm.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.241
Okay.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.890
If you say so.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.801
Petes don't worry.

03:47.880 --> 03:48.881
Chestnuts, sir?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.365
Ooh. Here you are, sir.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.808
Come to the Frost Fair, miss.
Only a sixpence, miss.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.568
Oh, my God.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.640
You're not stepping on a butterfly,
you're just taking a flyer.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.731
It's just time travel.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.246
Don't overthink it.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.961
- Is that what you said to Pete?
- Who's Pete?

04:46.760 --> 04:49.969
Yeah, no big deal.
Just walking on the Thames.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.367
I hope you realise
I'm going to try everything.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.446
Everything-

04:56.920 --> 05:00.561
- Tasty ox cheek, piping hot.
- Lapland mutton. Lapland mutton.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.403
Get your sheep hearts here.
Juicy, juicy sheep hearts.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.284
Yeah, maybe not everything.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.170
Oh, go on, try this.
This is my favourite.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.605
Your favourite?

05:10.680 --> 05:11.761
You've been here before?

05:11.920 --> 05:13.490
Oh yeah, few times.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.527
Get him!

05:23.600 --> 05:26.001
Course it's not really wrestling
unless it's in zero gravity.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.451
Seriously?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.767
- With tentacles.
- Okay.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.285
And magic spells.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.444
- Interesting.
- What is?

05:42.760 --> 05:45.650
Regency England. Bit more black
than they show in the movies.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.685
So was Jesus.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.281
History's a whitewash.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.523
Pub champion. Two years running.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.566
Huh.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.808
Fresh fish pies on the ice!

06:30.840 --> 06:34.322
Try your luck, ladies and gentlemen,
toss for a pie.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.762
Better luck next time, miss.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.364
And you're sure this isn't cow brains
or sheep eyes.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.363
No, I've caught the fish meself, miss.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.761
Made it right here in the old... Hey!

06:49.200 --> 06:51.202
- What are you about?
- Do that again, toss the coin.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.805
You pay me another, I will.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.282
Forget about the pie,
I don't want a pie.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.443
- I just want to see how you cheated.
- Cheated?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.086
Doctor.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.525
Don't look at me like that.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.490
I'm saying, you're a very good con-man.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.651
- A what?
- A trickster. A swindler.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.449
See, I'm a bit of a thief myself.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.569
You know, I bet you that I could steal
anything from your shop.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.920
Get out!

07:17.280 --> 07:18.566
In theory.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.405
I could steal anything. In theory.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.608
- Doctor.
- Honestly, some people...

07:25.160 --> 07:26.400
More pie?

07:29.120 --> 07:31.202
Are there side-effects to time travel?

07:31.280 --> 07:32.441
Like, physical symptoms?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.443
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.644
Sometimes, you see lights under the ice.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.243
Okay, so... You've seen the lights?

07:43.360 --> 07:44.407
Of course.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.209
Well, why didn't you say something?

07:46.280 --> 07:48.203
Well, you were enjoying yourself.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.482
I assumed we'd get to work eventually.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.443
Are these lights electric or organic?

08:30.120 --> 08:31.360
Organic lights?

08:31.680 --> 08:32.885
Bioluminescence.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.844
Fireflies. Glow-worms.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.967
Please, sir,
have you seen me dog?

08:39.039 --> 08:41.441
He was right here,
but then I looked away and he...

08:42.799 --> 08:44.564
Oh, it's okay. We'll help.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.690
Erm, what does he look like?

08:47.080 --> 08:48.366
He's small,

08:48.800 --> 08:51.087
and brown and ever so soft.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.646
Are you sure of that?

08:53.120 --> 08:55.441
That collar's for a big dog,
with long white hair.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.849
Nice con, though, respect.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.686
Run!

09:22.400 --> 09:23.447
What is it, do you think?

09:23.520 --> 09:24.965
Something valuable.

09:25.920 --> 09:26.967
Don't break it.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.320
What happened to the girl?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.562
Does it matter?
Boy's the one with your magic wand.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.211
Sonic screwdriver.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.441
How is that a screwdriver?

09:34.560 --> 09:35.766
In a very broad sense.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.247
- Oh, well, how is it sonic?
- It makes a noise.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.851
There they are!

09:52.080 --> 09:53.525
Spider! Come on!

09:54.600 --> 09:56.329
Kitty, come look.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.361
They'll catch you
and have you transported.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.521
Is that what you want?

10:01.120 --> 10:02.326
Spider!

10:02.920 --> 10:04.365
Spider! Quick!

10:04.720 --> 10:05.846
The lights.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.285
I see the lights.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.525
Kitty!

10:14.400 --> 10:15.526
Stay back!

10:46.720 --> 10:47.721
Save him.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.365
I can't. He's gone.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.169
Do something and save him.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.291
I'm sorry about your friend,

10:58.400 --> 10:59.765
but the danger isn't over yet.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.249
There must be more of you
living rough here.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.321
Tell me where.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.640
So you can take us to the magistrate?

11:04.720 --> 11:06.006
No, of course not!

11:06.080 --> 11:07.730
We're not here to arrest you,
we're here to help.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.604
And if you show me where you live,
we can do that.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.729
We? She's gone!

11:31.520 --> 11:33.124
How did you find me?

11:33.200 --> 11:34.406
Get used to that question.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.686
Oh, clever.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.490
You're very clever.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.326
What's wrong?

11:40.960 --> 11:42.291
What's wrong?

11:42.720 --> 11:44.484
Seriously? What's wrong?

11:45.680 --> 11:48.331
I've never seen anyone die before.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.523
A few hours ago, we were standing
in a garden full of dead people.

11:52.840 --> 11:53.966
It was different.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.162
- How?
- They were dead already.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.966
Morally and practically, that is not
a useful distinction, unlearn it.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.008
Don't tell me what to think.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.166
I'm your teacher.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.004
Telling you things is what I do.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.969
Yeah? Tell me this.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.291
You've seen people die before, yeah?

12:10.400 --> 12:11.686
- Of course.
- You still ca re?

12:11.760 --> 12:12.807
Of course I care.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.041
How many?

12:14.120 --> 12:15.281
How many what?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.650
If you care so much,

12:18.320 --> 12:20.402
tell me how many people you've seen die.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.166
I don't know.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.766
Okay-

12:28.200 --> 12:29.770
How many before you lost count?

12:31.240 --> 12:33.811
I care, Bill, but I move on.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.168
Yeah. How quickly?

12:37.280 --> 12:38.725
It's not me you're angry with.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.370
Have you ever killed anyone?

12:42.160 --> 12:44.606
There's a look in your eyes sometimes
that makes me wonder.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.441
Have you?

12:49.320 --> 12:51.482
There are situations when
the options available are limited.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.846
Not what I asked.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.880
Sometimes, the choices...

12:54.960 --> 12:56.803
That's not what I asked!

13:03.520 --> 13:04.646
Yes.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.286
How many?

13:17.520 --> 13:19.045
Don't tell me.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.444
You've moved on.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.685
And you know what happens
if I don't move on?

13:25.760 --> 13:26.886
More people die.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.166
There are kids living rough near here,

13:31.240 --> 13:32.890
they may well be next on the menu.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.766
Do you want to help me? Do you want
to stand here stamping your foot?

13:35.840 --> 13:39.162
Because let me tell you something,
I am 2,000 years old

13:40.320 --> 13:42.129
and I have never had the time

13:43.200 --> 13:45.282
for the luxury of outrage.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.044
What do you mean, "on the menu"?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.169
Is this where you live?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.526
For now.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.448
But there's no one here.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.721
Good work.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.284
Except you, Dot. I can see your shoes.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.409
They're too big, that's why.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.803
Oh, I see! I get it.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.564
You lure people to the fair,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.809
and then you rob them. Very good.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.964
Very enterprising.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.280
They're all right, Dot.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.802
Strange, but all right.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.731
And that's not how it is.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.806
Oh, what, uh, you don't rob people?

14:33.920 --> 14:35.331
Of course we do.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.244
But bringing people to the fair,
that's by the by.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.566
On the side, like.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.921
Why?

14:43.040 --> 14:46.408
Why? For coin of course, why else?

14:46.520 --> 14:48.488
Someone pays you to promote the fair.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.210
Get people onto the ice.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.564
Who? Who pays you?

14:54.680 --> 14:57.126
Kitty, where's Spider?

15:00.320 --> 15:01.446
Spider is...

15:02.920 --> 15:04.001
He...

15:06.480 --> 15:08.562
Who's hungry? I'm hungry.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.768
Food! Bill, food.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.360
- Food is always useful. Now!
- Yeah.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.522
I know what you're thinking.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.723
But don't worry, these are stolen!

15:26.120 --> 15:28.009
Well, eat up.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.531
Uh, with your permission, of course.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.406
"Don't suck your thumbs while I'm away."

15:45.480 --> 15:48.006
"The great tall tailor always comes"

15:48.120 --> 15:51.522
"To little boys who suck their thumbs."

15:51.840 --> 15:53.888
"And ere they dream what he's about"

15:54.400 --> 15:57.449
"He takes his great sharp scissors out"

15:57.960 --> 16:00.725
"And cuts their thumbs
clean off and then..."

16:00.800 --> 16:02.040
You done staring yet?

16:05.960 --> 16:08.088
We're gonna find out
what those things are, okay?

16:08.160 --> 16:10.367
They're not gonna
hurt anyone else, I promise.

16:11.560 --> 16:12.846
I promise.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.964
The Doctor, he helps people.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.406
That's what he does.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.401
And you? What do you do?
Apart from shout at him.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.486
We were fighting.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.811
- It happens.
- Are you still fighting now?

16:30.880 --> 16:32.006
No.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.851
I moved on.

16:40.680 --> 16:45.129
Okay, I'm wondering why the Frost Fair's
on this part of the river.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.207
I bet that at least one of you knows

16:48.440 --> 16:50.568
who paid Kitty to take people
out on the ice.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.283
- It was bad man with a ship.
- Dottie!

16:54.560 --> 16:56.050
A ship, what? You mean a merchant?

16:56.320 --> 16:57.765
- Not that kind of ship.
- Harry!

16:57.880 --> 16:59.530
- What?
- It's all right.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.605
You can tell him.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.170
It's a drawing.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.604
Here, on his hand.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.891
So, this guy, where would we find him?

17:09.960 --> 17:11.405
He finds us.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.567
But a tattoo on his hand, I mean,
we could ask around.

17:15.520 --> 17:19.002
Boring. I know something
that's much easier to find.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.770
Where are we going?

17:21.160 --> 17:23.401
All right, you guys, hang tight-

17:23.520 --> 17:24.646
Laters.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.361
I was being "all down with the kids"
there.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.441
Did you notice?

17:28.520 --> 17:30.841
- Yeah, my hair was cringing.
- Awesome.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.451
Please stop.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.411
So, what's easier to find?

17:36.480 --> 17:39.245
Conjecture that something's frozen
under the Thames and it's eating people.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.601
Okay-

17:40.720 --> 17:42.051
Proposal, we need to get
a closer look at it.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.483
- Good, yeah.
- Plan... Let's get eaten.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.326
Wha...

17:48.920 --> 17:50.410
Is this stuff safe?

17:51.360 --> 17:52.805
- Potentially.
- Potentially?

17:52.920 --> 17:54.081
What does "potentially" mean?

17:54.200 --> 17:55.486
Safe for the frisson of excitement.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.370
Right, but we're not gonna be, like,

17:58.440 --> 18:00.283
completely defenceless down there,
though?

18:00.360 --> 18:01.646
No, no, no, no.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.681
Well, yes, but don't worry about it.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.329
Why not?
What have you got up your sleeve?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.331
Oh, my God!

18:09.440 --> 18:10.885
Have you been holding out on me?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.445
Do you have, like, magical alien powers?

18:15.480 --> 18:17.130
What, was that an impolite question?

18:18.080 --> 18:20.606
Why do we need diving suits
on top of the ice?

18:20.680 --> 18:23.684
If we're lucky,
the lights will come and take us under.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.009
Whatever they are, they're clever.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.844
When they went after the boy,

18:27.960 --> 18:31.601
they waited until he was away
from the crowds. By himself.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.121
What?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.251
Did you say something?

18:35.520 --> 18:36.851
Question is, how?

18:55.160 --> 18:56.366
Doctor?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.401
Doctor?

19:06.720 --> 19:08.643
Doctor!

19:16.640 --> 19:18.529
Bingo!

21:08.360 --> 21:10.408
Stop, I know you!

21:10.720 --> 21:12.643
You're the cheat. I love your work!

21:15.960 --> 21:17.450
That sound it made.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.961
I couldn't hear you, but that noise...

21:21.600 --> 21:23.523
It was like I felt it in my bones,
you know?

21:24.960 --> 21:27.042
It sounded like... Like...

21:27.160 --> 21:28.491
Despair.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.730
Loneliness.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.841
A prisoner in chains.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.805
That guy, he said he caught
the fish himself.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.971
I bought a pie off that guy. Fish pie.

21:42.520 --> 21:43.885
Oh, hello!

21:45.240 --> 21:46.844
Aren't they magnificent.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.601
I ate that pie. I liked that pie.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.765
Definitely not carnivores.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.403
Which means you're co-operating
with the creature.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.002
Providing for him.
What do you get in return, hmm?

21:57.360 --> 21:59.010
What did it take for you
to evolve into that?

22:01.280 --> 22:03.726
The creature. Do you reckon
that's what's making London so cold?

22:04.760 --> 22:06.091
Very possibly.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.925
What kind of alien messes
with the weather?

22:08.240 --> 22:10.368
You assume it's alien.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.486
- Of course it's alien.
- Alien, terrestrial... It's irrelevant.

22:14.560 --> 22:18.087
The real question is,
who's keeping it in those chains?

22:18.440 --> 22:21.728
And perhaps our friend here
can answer that.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.688
Who are ya? What do you want with me?

22:26.880 --> 22:28.803
The coin trick, just tell me
how to do it, please.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.721
Okay, not the time.

22:30.800 --> 22:35.931
Have you ever seen a man around here
with a tattoo of a ship?

22:37.680 --> 22:39.205
What's that face? Is that a no?

22:39.560 --> 22:41.642
Or are you against tattoos?
I'm against tattoos, too.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.210
I think that we are bonding.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.320
We're stood by the docks
and you just asked me

22:46.400 --> 22:47.970
if I've ever seen a man
with a tattoo of a ship.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.924
- Exactly.
- Fair point.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.921
- What point?
- Forget the tattoos.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.251
Have you seen anyone
acting suspiciously since the freeze?

22:56.320 --> 22:58.641
Well, there's the dredges.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.600
The dredges?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.848
- There's a workhouse up river.
- Hurry up!

23:02.920 --> 23:05.127
There's men out there
patrolling all hours.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.486
Be quick about it!

23:06.880 --> 23:09.247
- What are they dredging for?
- Let's find out.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.124
How we getting in?

23:14.640 --> 23:16.210
You work for the palace.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.404
Haven't heard that one in a while.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.721
Oy. How'd you get through here?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.601
A-ha. At last, someone in authority.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.289
Oh, I... I do apologise, sir.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.245
Does Lord Sutcliffe know you're here?

23:34.800 --> 23:36.689
Does Lord Sutcliffe know we're here?

23:37.760 --> 23:39.205
Does Lord Sutcliffe know we're here?

23:40.320 --> 23:43.210
- Lord Sutcliffe insisted we come.
- Hmm.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.364
- Oh, that Lord Sutcliffe, yes.
- Mmm.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.920
There's no arguing with Sutcliffe
when he puts his foot down.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.365
You better show us around.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.524
Follow me, sir.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.605
Take it inside!

23:57.880 --> 23:59.370
Why all the fuss?

23:59.680 --> 24:03.002
- It's just mud from the river, isn't it?
- Ah, that's one word for it.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.123
Is this even the right place?

24:05.360 --> 24:07.203
Creature's almost a mile away.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.169
The creature's head
is almost a mile away.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.204
I assume we're now at the other end.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.529
These men, why do we trust them?

24:16.080 --> 24:18.890
- Hired them all myself, sir.
- Ah, and why do I trust you?

24:19.520 --> 24:20.567
Sir?

24:20.640 --> 24:22.369
You understand how important
this is, yes?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.722
It's imperative that no one discovers

24:24.800 --> 24:26.643
where the stuff goes
when it leaves here.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.324
Oh, I know that, sir.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.522
- We use unmarked cars.
- And are they ever followed?

24:31.080 --> 24:32.570
- Oh no, sir.
- Have you checked this personally?

24:32.640 --> 24:34.130
- Oh yes, sir.
- All the way to Hampton?

24:34.720 --> 24:36.643
No, to the steel mill, sir.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.722
- Hampton's code for the steel mill.
- Code?

24:41.040 --> 24:43.202
Yes, we need to use code,
otherwise anyone can walk in here

24:43.280 --> 24:44.770
and get you blabbing away like a fool.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.811
That's a good point, sir.

24:48.280 --> 24:52.330
Now, these men,
what do they know of this material?

24:52.920 --> 24:54.251
No more than I do, sir.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.251
Yes, but you are someone
who knows more than he tells.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.325
I'm not one to speculate.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.726
But you can't help it
because you are a man of intelligence.

25:04.560 --> 25:08.326
Well, they won't let us smoke in here
so I assume it's fuel.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.245
Fuel for the furnaces, sir.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.484
Excellent reasoning.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.850
Lord Sutcliffe appreciates
an inquiring mind.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.002
Well, I keep me ear
to the ground, you know.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.003
And what does the ground say these days?

25:22.560 --> 25:25.882
That this stuff burns
a thousand times longer than coal.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.891
Very good.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.964
Hotter too.
Hotter than they can measure.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.286
Excellent.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.450
First class.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.771
- I'm right, aren't I, sir?
- Oh, there's no stopping you.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.161
You keep this up, and you won't be
working in this yard for very long.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.169
- Oh, you think not?
- Oh, I can almost guarantee it.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.883
You know what else they say?

25:49.440 --> 25:52.091
They say it even burns under water.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.886
No sh...

25:56.800 --> 26:00.327
So, this guy has a pet monster
that turns people into fuel

26:00.440 --> 26:02.761
and we're just walking up at his door?

26:03.120 --> 26:05.282
That's his door, this is us walking.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.887
If we're going to stop him,
I need to know where he started.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.530
- Meaning?
- Which planet.

26:10.680 --> 26:11.761
Which planet?

26:14.160 --> 26:17.687
- So, you think Sutcliffe is an alien?
- Possibly.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.371
Because the creature is an alien.

26:19.640 --> 26:23.440
It certainly appears to be producing
fuel suitable for interstellar travel.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.046
By the way, Bill...

26:29.040 --> 26:32.442
- I need you to leave the talking to me.
- Why?

26:33.440 --> 26:34.726
Because you have a temper.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.771
Okay, well,
I lost it a tiny bit.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.764
You're about to meet a man,
alien or otherwise,

26:39.840 --> 26:41.444
for whom human beings are raw material.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.404
Who grinds up children for profit.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.929
What we're here for is one thing.
Information.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.282
You get that with diplomacy and tact,
charm, if necessary.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.201
Okay-

26:55.680 --> 26:56.920
I get it.

26:58.400 --> 27:03.281
Always remember, Bill.
Passion fights, but reason wins.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.485
Dr Disco from the Fairford Club.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.211
Obviously, one aspires to membership

27:11.280 --> 27:13.362
but to actually be considered for...

27:15.840 --> 27:18.161
Who... Who let this creature in here?

27:18.240 --> 27:21.210
On your feet, girl,
in the presence of your betters.

27:27.840 --> 27:32.004
He's human. Thirty-one years of age.
Low in iron.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.130
Yeah, that was pretty convincing racism
for an extra-terrestrial.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.770
My thoughts exactly.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.165
Oh, hello. Er, can I just say
this is very unlike me.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.289
- I don't normally do this.
- Er, yeah, he was aiming for charming.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.680
Basically.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.085
Well...

27:52.440 --> 27:54.090
You're not from the Fairford Club.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.929
The creature in the river,
where did it come from?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.843
Who the devil are you people?

27:57.920 --> 27:59.843
- Where did it come from?
- Nowhere.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.611
It's always been there.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.001
The secret's been passed down
in the family since...

28:04.280 --> 28:05.361
I don't know when.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.602
As far back as records go.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.648
And tell me, do you also keep a record
of how many it's killed?

28:09.760 --> 28:10.761
Please.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.364
People know the ice is dangerous,

28:13.440 --> 28:15.602
yet they will insist
on their festivities.

28:15.680 --> 28:16.966
That's hardly my fault.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.241
Don't sell yourself short.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.004
This is the biggest Frost Fair
in decades.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.206
- That's down to you.
- It is?

28:24.480 --> 28:27.051
Man holding me has a tattoo
on his left hand.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.044
That's not all, is it?

28:29.440 --> 28:32.489
The circus performers,
the elephant, it's all you.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.291
I made the most of the situation.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.644
It's the first proper freeze
it's caused in years.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.531
Why? Production down, huh?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.206
Not enough people dying.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.807
Girl, you show the ignorance
of all your kind.

28:49.120 --> 28:52.727
Without that beast,
my mills would rely on coal mines.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.361
Men die in coal mines all the time.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.811
I preferred it when you were alien.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.126
When I was...

29:00.280 --> 29:01.884
Well, that explained
the lack of humanity.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.687
What makes you so sure
that your life is worth more

29:05.760 --> 29:06.966
than those people out there on the ice?

29:07.040 --> 29:08.849
Is it the money?
The accident of birth

29:10.320 --> 29:11.924
that put you inside the big,
fancy house?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.129
I help move this country forward.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.730
I move this empire forward.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.729
Human progress
isn't measured by industry.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.765
It's measured by the value you
place on a life.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.650
An unimportant life.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.649
A life without privilege.

29:30.720 --> 29:34.042
The boy who died on the river,
that boy's value is your value.

29:34.480 --> 29:39.691
That's what defines an age.
That's what defines a species.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.485
What a beautiful speech.

29:45.120 --> 29:50.047
The rhythm and, and vocabulary...
Quite outstanding.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.449
It's enough to move anyone
with an ounce of compassion.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.408
So it's really not your day, is it?

30:02.560 --> 30:04.642
If they know about the beast,
then others must, too.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.250
We bring the plan forward.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.004
- When, sir?
- Now.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.366
In daylight.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.529
No time for outrage.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.724
Never had time for anything else, right?

30:28.800 --> 30:30.006
Don't be smug.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.970
Smug belongs to me.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.769
Are you really 2,000 years old?

30:38.240 --> 30:39.366
Why?

30:40.600 --> 30:41.840
I just

30:42.000 --> 30:44.002
wanted to know how long it takes

30:44.120 --> 30:46.327
before you can make a speech
like the one you just made.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.805
It's worth the wait.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.926
- Trouble.
- Out!

31:10.160 --> 31:11.207
Get in!

31:11.600 --> 31:13.125
Sit down and shut up!

31:13.880 --> 31:14.881
Could be rum.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.004
Rum came in barrels.

31:19.640 --> 31:21.130
Smell that.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.931
It's homemade rocket fuel
redeployed as explosive.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.211
It's a little reckless, don't you think?

31:26.680 --> 31:28.523
Half the fair disappears into the river.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.888
The secret of your success
won't be a secret any more.

31:31.160 --> 31:33.527
Hardly. The city will pause to mourn

31:33.600 --> 31:35.602
a fireworks display gone
tragically awry,

31:35.680 --> 31:37.921
and the creature will be fed.

31:38.520 --> 31:42.002
By spring, this will be a footnote
in history.

31:42.240 --> 31:45.210
That is progress.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.081
They're bringing the elephant
out presently.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.685
You won't get bigger crowds than that,

31:49.760 --> 31:52.570
so make sure you're off the ice by noon.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.926
Noon?

31:54.040 --> 31:55.690
There's no way you can keep us here
that long.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.524
We'll just scream our heads off.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.331
- No, no, please, please, please...
- Help!

32:05.120 --> 32:06.406
Sixpence to the waterman...

32:14.960 --> 32:16.644
If you're quite finished,
I could use some help.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.886
What are you...

32:19.440 --> 32:21.841
- Sonic screwdriver. Inside pocket.
- Oh. Okay.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.247
Can you...

32:36.320 --> 32:39.051
- Yes! Yes!
- Okay.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.964
Okay.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.841
Um, Doctor...

32:47.920 --> 32:49.126
Huh?

32:50.080 --> 32:51.366
Oh, hello.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.607
- How are you doing that?
- Er... Er...

32:57.280 --> 32:58.884
Sonic screwdriver.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.326
It makes a noise.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.323
That's how the fish choose their victim.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.968
That's how they know they've isolated
someone on the ice.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.282
Erm, better question,
why are you doing that?

33:07.680 --> 33:09.284
Just... just a little more.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.046
What are you...

33:17.920 --> 33:19.001
Give me that!

33:26.560 --> 33:27.607
What the...

33:27.680 --> 33:28.681
Turn it off.
There's a button on the side.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.487
Here! Give it here!

33:36.480 --> 33:38.244
I'm afraid it has a knack to it.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.686
Bill?

33:47.840 --> 33:51.925
- Miss Potts, I need you with me.
- I... I...

33:52.200 --> 33:54.771
Things to do, Bill, decisions to make.
What are we going to do about Tiny?

33:56.120 --> 33:57.610
- Tiny?
- The creature.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.163
The Loch Ness monster.
The naughty little mermaid.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.446
Are we just going to leave
her down there?

34:01.880 --> 34:03.325
Well, we can't set her free.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.971
She could burst up out of the water
and eat a hundred people

34:07.040 --> 34:08.485
right off of South Bank.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.449
- She could eat half of London!
- She might. It's a risk.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.563
- So, what do you want to do, Bill?
- We already know the answers.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.722
- Why are you even asking?
- I don't know the answers.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.364
Only idiots know the answers.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.730
But if your future is built
on the suffering of that creature,

34:23.960 --> 34:25.291
what's your future worth?

34:29.120 --> 34:30.485
Why is it up to me?

34:30.560 --> 34:32.005
Because it can't be up to me.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.329
Your people, your planet I serve
at the pleasure of the human race,

34:35.400 --> 34:37.607
and right now, that's you.
Give me an order.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.370
Not long till noon.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.685
I need an order.

34:54.239 --> 34:57.608
Save her.

35:00.360 --> 35:03.284
I'll take care of this,
you get everyone off the ice.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.004
- Need help. Need it now. You in?
- Where's your friend?

35:11.400 --> 35:13.289
- Not here.
- What's he doing?

35:13.400 --> 35:16.449
Not sure, but whatever it is,
I don't think we're going to miss it.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.570
The thaw! The thaw is here!

35:18.840 --> 35:20.365
A lady fell through the ice!

35:24.760 --> 35:26.250
Quick! Get to the shore!

35:30.440 --> 35:31.646
The ice is melting!

35:36.760 --> 35:39.366
It's a mistake! The ice isn't melting!

35:40.200 --> 35:42.202
I swear to you. There's no thaw!

35:44.920 --> 35:45.921
Argh!

35:46.240 --> 35:47.685
The ice is melting!

35:48.160 --> 35:51.209
Quickly, quickly. That's it.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.602
Come on! Hurry! Come on!

36:02.720 --> 36:04.449
Something's happened.
They've got the word out.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.885
We blow it now.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.080
Not yet.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.804
- The ice is melting!
- Harriet.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.329
- Run.
- But there's still people...

36:15.400 --> 36:16.811
Forget them. There's no time.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.246
Kitty?

36:18.360 --> 36:19.486
Run.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.491
Now!

36:36.640 --> 36:37.766
What?

36:46.880 --> 36:48.848
Out of my way!

36:53.240 --> 36:54.526
Quick! Get to the shore!

37:36.160 --> 37:38.049
Doctor! Doctor!

37:38.400 --> 37:39.561
Bill!

37:42.200 --> 37:43.247
Bill!

37:43.680 --> 37:44.806
You did it!

37:44.920 --> 37:46.081
She's free!

38:10.240 --> 38:11.366
Go.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.206
Where will she go?

38:13.280 --> 38:14.566
Somewhere cold, I imagine.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.489
Hopefully, she's smart enough
to avoid you lot now.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.324
You... What if she isn't?

38:20.640 --> 38:22.722
What if we just, like, doomed Greenland?

38:23.960 --> 38:25.325
I'll check in on Greenland.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.490
How long is she?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.330
Aw...

38:44.280 --> 38:45.884
Can you hear that?

38:52.160 --> 38:53.446
Hattie, look!

38:59.480 --> 39:01.005
No pinching anything, you hear me?

39:02.040 --> 39:04.646
And no staring like gapeseeds
when the lady talks peculiar.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.209
It's rude.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.887
Get a load of you lot!
Cute house. Come in.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.730
You gonna tell us what we're here for?

39:18.680 --> 39:20.125
A very long time I hope.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.205
Go on!

39:33.280 --> 39:34.406
Eat as much as you like.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.801
Er, you boy, remind me,
what's your name?

39:44.160 --> 39:45.286
Perry.

39:46.400 --> 39:49.165
Perry. His name's Perry. Why?

39:50.960 --> 39:54.362
Er, apparently, Lord Sutcliffe's
long-lost heir can't be a girl.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.008
We must have
changed something, right?

40:13.280 --> 40:15.567
I mean, people saw a monster
in the Thames.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.364
Oh, it doesn't look any different.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.804
All right.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.001
Here you go.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.126
Here's your tea.

40:27.080 --> 40:29.970
And I put a bit of coffee in it as well
just to give it some flavour.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.611
See? It's much better
when you stick to your oath.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.525
Oh, sir, no. This is unacceptable.
This is beyond unacceptable.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.648
- This is naughty.
- Language.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.081
I don't get it. "London 1814."

40:48.040 --> 40:50.407
"Monster." "Sea creature." "Serpent."

40:51.200 --> 40:53.282
"Really, really big fish." Nothing.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.970
Sir, you said you wouldn't be
going off-world.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.240
Do these look like off-world
clothes to you?

41:00.560 --> 41:02.483
But, sir, you said
you'd be coming back to your office.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.205
Look. Here I am.

41:04.800 --> 41:09.761
I'm in my office. I'm drinking my tea,
in my specially-chosen tea clothes.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.206
I don't understand.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.090
How could it not have
been headline news?

41:13.160 --> 41:15.322
Never underestimate
the collective human ability

41:15.400 --> 41:17.129
to overlook the inexplicable.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.847
Also, the Frost Fair involved
a lot of day drinking. May I?

41:23.160 --> 41:25.481
You can always rely upon the papers
to miss a headline.

41:28.880 --> 41:31.247
"Shock as steel fortune
is passed to street urchin."

41:31.840 --> 41:34.923
Sir, we need to talk. Your oath.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.486
- Give us a coin.
- What?

41:36.680 --> 41:39.923
"The new Lord Sutcliffe was found
starving on London's streets."

41:40.640 --> 41:42.130
"Inheritance was contested."

41:42.680 --> 41:45.445
Everyone got super mad.
Blah, blah, blah...

41:45.720 --> 41:47.643
"Urchin boy deemed legitimate."

41:48.160 --> 41:49.650
Oh, my God, it worked!

41:50.560 --> 41:53.086
You did it. You saved them.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.841
You did.

41:56.480 --> 42:00.485
- You gave the order, boss.
- Sir...

42:02.880 --> 42:04.211
Give me a coin.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.571
We'll toss for it.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.809
Heads the TARDIS stays put...

42:09.720 --> 42:10.926
Tails...

42:12.320 --> 42:13.765
You leave me alone.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.803
Leave him alone.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.609
Chance would be a fine thing.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.006
Leave me alone.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.322
How's about that for a new idea?

42:25.760 --> 42:27.967
Never asked to be reassembled, did I?

42:31.080 --> 42:32.320
Knocking.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.530
What's that about?

42:36.640 --> 42:38.768
No one's gonna open the door
just because you're knocking.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.846
Oh, getting cocky now, are you?

42:43.960 --> 42:46.281
Why? What do you think you know?

42:48.960 --> 42:50.530
What has he told you?

42:52.320 --> 42:54.926
Because yeah,
he might have a little friend now

42:55.040 --> 42:57.088
and yeah, he may be a little
bit distracted,

42:57.160 --> 42:58.366
but I'll tell you something,

42:58.440 --> 43:00.010
I'm still here!

43:00.320 --> 43:01.731
And as long as I'm still here,

43:01.800 --> 43:04.167
you are going nowhere!

43:11.800 --> 43:13.450
Are you looking for somewhere to live?

43:15.520 --> 43:16.601
That's your house?

43:16.840 --> 43:18.410
Sharing, yeah. Six of us.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.682
- How do you get into the tower?
- You don't.

43:21.120 --> 43:23.043
What's that noise?

43:23.160 --> 43:24.525
There's a massive mystery going on.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.004
See you in the morning.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.769
The house is eating people.

43:32.840 --> 43:34.888
No, no, no. There's something in here.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.969
Come back, hey!

43:37.440 --> 43:40.330
You signed the contract.
It's time to pay.
