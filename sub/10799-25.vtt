00:02.250 --> 00:05.792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.250 --> 00:05.792
<i>Stardate 43957.2.</i>

00:05.834 --> 00:08.291
<i>We are charting</i>

00:05.834 --> 00:08.291
<i>an unexplored star system</i>

00:08.333 --> 00:10.208
<i>within the Zeta Gelis Cluster.</i>

00:10.250 --> 00:12.083
<i>This routine assignment</i>

00:10.250 --> 00:12.083
<i>has made</i>

00:12.125 --> 00:17.125
<i>for a refreshingly quiet time</i>

00:12.125 --> 00:17.125
<i>aboard the</i> Enterprise.

00:17.166 --> 00:18.750
That's her.

00:20.166 --> 00:21.500
WORF:

00:20.166 --> 00:21.500
Which one?

00:21.542 --> 00:22.917
LA FORGE:

00:21.542 --> 00:22.917
The one on the right.

00:23.917 --> 00:25.500
Don't stare.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.667
Why not?

00:26.709 --> 00:29.291
Because she'll see.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.750
Good.

00:30.792 --> 00:34.667
You must let her see

00:30.792 --> 00:34.667
the fire in your eyes.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.875
But what would I say?

00:41.583 --> 00:43.417
Words come later.

00:43.458 --> 00:47.959
It is the scent

00:43.458 --> 00:47.959
that first speaks of love.

00:49.667 --> 00:53.041
Thanks, Worf.

00:49.667 --> 00:53.041
That helps a lot.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.208
Hi, Geordi.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.834
(<i> clears throat</i> )

01:06.041 --> 01:08.291
Hi.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.667
So, how have you been?

01:09.709 --> 01:11.625
Good, uh...

01:11.667 --> 01:14.041
(<i> sighs</i> )

01:14.083 --> 01:16.208
How are things

01:14.083 --> 01:16.208
down in Engineering?

01:16.250 --> 01:18.166
Fine, they...

01:19.417 --> 01:20.542
(<i> growls softly</i> )

01:20.583 --> 01:22.709
They-- they've been fine.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.792
Well, I'll see you around.

01:29.583 --> 01:32.375
(<i> sighs</i> )

01:32.417 --> 01:34.625
I have much to teach you

01:32.417 --> 01:34.625
about women.

01:34.667 --> 01:38.041
RIKER:

01:34.667 --> 01:38.041
Mr. La Forge, report

01:34.667 --> 01:38.041
to Transporter Room Three.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.000
What's this all

01:45.500 --> 01:47.000
about, Commander?

01:47.041 --> 01:48.792
Sensors have discovered

01:47.041 --> 01:48.792
a small one-man spaceship

01:48.834 --> 01:50.041
crashed on the planet.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.417
We've picked up

01:50.083 --> 01:51.417
life-signs--

01:51.458 --> 01:53.875
humanoid, very faint and fading.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.041
Radiation levels

02:04.291 --> 02:07.041
within acceptable limits.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.041
LA FORGE:

02:27.333 --> 02:29.041
We can beam him out

02:27.333 --> 02:29.041
from under there.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.291
Get him right up

02:29.083 --> 02:30.291
to Sick Bay.

02:30.333 --> 02:32.709
He's not stable enough

02:30.333 --> 02:32.709
for transport.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.583
There's damage

02:32.750 --> 02:34.583
to his brain stem.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.166
Autonomic functions are failing.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.208
His heart needs

02:36.208 --> 02:38.208
active neural feedback.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.291
It can't regulate itself.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.709
I need a volunteer.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.208
Right here.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.834
I'm going to hook up

02:45.834 --> 02:47.834
your nervous systems

02:47.875 --> 02:49.542
through the tricorder.

02:49.583 --> 02:52.041
Your brain will

02:49.583 --> 02:52.041
regulate both systems.

02:52.083 --> 02:53.625
That should stabilize

02:52.083 --> 02:53.625
him long enough

02:53.667 --> 02:55.875
to get him

02:53.667 --> 02:55.875
up to the ship.

02:55.917 --> 02:58.333
Take deep, regular breaths.

02:58.375 --> 02:59.542
If anything goes wrong,

02:59.583 --> 03:00.917
I'll break

02:59.583 --> 03:00.917
the connection.

03:00.959 --> 03:02.208
Okay.

03:06.375 --> 03:07.500
(<i> gasps</i> )

03:07.542 --> 03:09.750
Geordi.

03:09.792 --> 03:12.250
I'm fine. No problem.

03:12.291 --> 03:15.959
Transporter Room, three to

03:12.291 --> 03:15.959
beam directly to Sick Bay.

03:48.875 --> 03:53.417
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

03:53.458 --> 03:57.417
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:53.458 --> 03:57.417
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

03:57.458 --> 03:59.250
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

03:59.291 --> 04:02.875
<i>to explore</i>

03:59.291 --> 04:02.875
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

04:02.917 --> 04:07.417
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:02.917 --> 04:07.417
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

04:07.458 --> 04:12.166
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:07.458 --> 04:12.166
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:28.875 --> 05:30.750
Autonomic responses

05:28.875 --> 05:30.750
are still low.

05:30.792 --> 05:32.291
Begin cardiostimulation.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.667
60 cc's of inaprovaline.

05:37.041 --> 05:38.583
Massive infection is setting in.

05:38.625 --> 05:41.542
Use the protodynoplaser

05:38.625 --> 05:41.542
to stabilize his immune system.

05:41.583 --> 05:43.417
We need to design a virus

05:43.458 --> 05:45.041
that can infiltrate

05:43.458 --> 05:45.041
his cell structure

05:45.083 --> 05:46.667
and boost his ATP production.

05:46.709 --> 05:48.041
NURSE TEMPLE:

05:46.709 --> 05:48.041
What about Commander La Forge?

05:48.083 --> 05:49.625
He's waiting

05:48.083 --> 05:49.625
in the diagnostic center.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.208
I need you to give him

05:49.667 --> 05:51.208
a full bio-scan.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.709
See if there's

05:51.250 --> 05:52.709
any residual effect

05:52.750 --> 05:54.917
from that energy discharge

05:52.750 --> 05:54.917
during the neurolink.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.834
Keep his arm

05:54.959 --> 05:56.834
in cryogenic stasis

05:56.875 --> 05:58.542
until the vital signs

05:56.875 --> 05:58.542
are strong enough

05:58.583 --> 06:00.709
for surgical procedures.

06:02.166 --> 06:03.667
From the size and shape

06:02.166 --> 06:03.667
of the wreckage,

06:03.709 --> 06:05.834
it appeared to be

06:03.709 --> 06:05.834
some kind of an escape pod.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.625
Their control system

06:05.875 --> 06:07.625
was badly damaged,

06:07.667 --> 06:09.375
which is probably

06:07.667 --> 06:09.375
what caused the crash.

06:09.417 --> 06:10.709
An escape pod?

06:10.750 --> 06:12.500
Then he couldn't

06:10.750 --> 06:12.500
have traveled very far.

06:12.542 --> 06:15.417
Mr. Data, are there any other

06:12.542 --> 06:15.417
signs of ships in the area?

06:15.458 --> 06:17.250
I am picking up

06:15.458 --> 06:17.250
a scattering of debris

06:17.291 --> 06:19.625
in extended orbit

06:17.291 --> 06:19.625
around the planet.

06:19.667 --> 06:23.458
It reads as refined metals

06:19.667 --> 06:23.458
and other synthetic compounds.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.208
The remains of

06:23.500 --> 06:25.208
a larger vessel.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.583
He must have

06:25.250 --> 06:26.583
left in the pod

06:26.625 --> 06:28.583
before the ship

06:26.625 --> 06:28.583
was destroyed.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.417
Sensors show trace elements

06:28.625 --> 06:30.417
in the debris

06:30.458 --> 06:33.250
that would indicate phaser fire

06:30.458 --> 06:33.250
was recently exchanged.

06:33.291 --> 06:35.291
Were you able to

06:33.291 --> 06:35.291
salvage anything else

06:35.333 --> 06:36.750
from the escape pod?

06:35.333 --> 06:36.750
This is all that was left

06:36.792 --> 06:38.500
from their

06:36.792 --> 06:38.500
computer system.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.291
Mr. Data,

06:38.542 --> 06:40.291
can you access it?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.041
It will take time, sir.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.500
Downloading this into our system

06:43.542 --> 06:45.917
will require fabrication

06:43.542 --> 06:45.917
of a matrix translator

06:45.959 --> 06:47.834
to emulate

06:45.959 --> 06:47.834
the alien's computer system.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.500
Keep me apprised

06:47.875 --> 06:49.500
of your progress.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.083
Aye, sir.

07:11.375 --> 07:14.542
Limb re-fusion appears

07:11.375 --> 07:14.542
to be successful, Doctor.

07:14.583 --> 07:17.291
Tissue oxygenation

07:14.583 --> 07:17.291
is within norms.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.959
Hmm. That's all

07:17.333 --> 07:19.959
we can do for now.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.250
We won't be

07:20.000 --> 07:21.250
able to test

07:21.291 --> 07:23.125
neuromuscular function

07:21.291 --> 07:23.125
for a few days.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.333
(<i> door opens</i> )

07:26.083 --> 07:27.875
Ah, Geordi.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.667
Can I go now, Doc?

07:29.709 --> 07:31.375
No need to keep you here,

07:29.709 --> 07:31.375
your bio-scan

07:31.417 --> 07:32.542
came out negative.

07:32.583 --> 07:33.750
Could have told you that.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.750
I feel great.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.750
How's your patient?

07:41.792 --> 07:43.041
(<i> sighs</i> )

07:43.083 --> 07:45.583
I never thought

07:43.083 --> 07:45.583
he'd make it this far.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.500
There was major trauma to

07:45.625 --> 07:48.500
his head and chest cavity,

07:48.542 --> 07:51.792
massive plasma loss and severe

07:48.542 --> 07:51.792
damage to most of his organs.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.250
What are his chances?

07:53.291 --> 07:55.000
I believe he's

07:53.291 --> 07:55.000
going to live.

07:55.041 --> 07:58.667
I'm afraid I can't take

07:55.041 --> 07:58.667
the credit for it, though.

07:58.709 --> 08:03.208
His body seems to have

07:58.709 --> 08:03.208
amazing recuperative powers.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.583
The damaged tissue seems

08:03.250 --> 08:05.583
to be repairing itself

08:05.625 --> 08:08.834
at a phenomenal rate.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.000
There's one thing

08:08.875 --> 08:11.000
that troubles me, though.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.875
What's that?

08:13.917 --> 08:16.208
Take a look at this.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.125
Cell regeneration.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.000
Yes.

08:23.041 --> 08:27.375
The thing is, it has nothing

08:23.041 --> 08:27.375
to do with the injuries.

08:27.417 --> 08:30.959
These are undamaged cells

08:27.417 --> 08:30.959
that seem to be mutating.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.917
Do you have a theory

08:31.000 --> 08:32.917
as to the cause?

08:32.959 --> 08:36.834
No, I've never seen anything

08:32.959 --> 08:36.834
like it in my life.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.291
There is a possibility

08:38.333 --> 08:41.500
that it's part of his

08:38.333 --> 08:41.500
natural healing process.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.083
I hope it is,

08:43.125 --> 08:45.709
because there's nothing

08:43.125 --> 08:45.709
I can do to stop it.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.500
I'm telling you, Data,

08:47.208 --> 08:49.500
there's got to be some way

08:49.542 --> 08:51.500
to decode the information

08:49.542 --> 08:51.500
in this thing.

08:51.542 --> 08:55.458
I agree, Geordi, but the data

08:51.542 --> 08:55.458
matrix within the capsule

08:55.500 --> 08:57.834
does not correspond

08:55.500 --> 08:57.834
to any standard format.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.583
All we have been

08:57.875 --> 08:59.583
able to determine

08:59.625 --> 09:02.250
is that the device contains

08:59.625 --> 09:02.250
a chemically-based system

09:02.291 --> 09:03.750
for molecular energy encoding.

09:03.792 --> 09:05.625
Yeah, and the computer

09:03.792 --> 09:05.625
still can't analyze

09:05.667 --> 09:07.750
the specific chemical

09:05.667 --> 09:07.750
elements involved.

09:07.792 --> 09:10.291
It's gotta be part of the

09:07.792 --> 09:10.291
data processing system.

09:10.333 --> 09:15.083
What if... it's a feedback

09:10.333 --> 09:15.083
loop controller?

09:15.125 --> 09:17.041
The compact shape does suggest

09:17.083 --> 09:20.250
a rapid chemical processing

09:17.083 --> 09:20.250
and storage capacity.

09:20.291 --> 09:21.750
We found it

09:20.291 --> 09:21.750
near the escape pod's

09:21.792 --> 09:23.458
instrumentation assemblage.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.417
This capsule might process

09:23.500 --> 09:26.417
the ship's dynamic motions

09:26.458 --> 09:28.542
and augment its manual

09:26.458 --> 09:28.542
control inputs.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.417
You know, we could

09:28.583 --> 09:30.417
send it a few test signals.

09:30.458 --> 09:31.917
Make it think

09:30.458 --> 09:31.917
the entire assemblage

09:31.959 --> 09:33.041
was awake and operating.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.542
An intriguing experiment.

09:35.583 --> 09:37.417
The capsule might provide us

09:35.583 --> 09:37.417
with information

09:37.458 --> 09:41.667
without the need to decode

09:37.458 --> 09:41.667
the storage medium itself.

09:41.709 --> 09:44.000
Perhaps we should examine

09:41.709 --> 09:44.000
your theory immediately.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.542
WORF:

09:44.041 --> 09:45.542
Less talk.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.917
More synthehol.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.834
We came here to relax.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.333
I am relaxed.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.750
In fact, I've never felt better.

09:59.875 --> 10:02.834
But you know, Worf,

09:59.875 --> 10:02.834
you're right.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.625
The storage capsule

10:02.875 --> 10:05.625
can wait awhile.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.458
See you, Patti.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.959
Christy, you're not

10:14.500 --> 10:17.959
leaving, are you?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.333
I was just on my way

10:18.000 --> 10:20.333
down to the arboretum.

10:20.375 --> 10:24.250
Mmm, would you care

10:20.375 --> 10:24.250
for some company?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.750
I'd love some,

10:24.291 --> 10:25.750
but I didn't think

10:25.792 --> 10:27.667
you were interested

10:25.792 --> 10:27.667
in that kind of thing.

10:27.709 --> 10:30.125
Mmm, there are a

10:27.709 --> 10:30.125
lot of things

10:30.166 --> 10:32.625
that you don't

10:30.166 --> 10:32.625
know about me.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.667
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

10:38.709 --> 10:41.333
I've been tutoring him.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.709
He learns very quickly.

10:46.291 --> 10:50.542
CRUSHER:

10:46.291 --> 10:50.542
<i>Medical Log, Stardate 43958.8.</i>

10:50.583 --> 10:53.500
<i>I have removed patient</i>

10:50.583 --> 10:53.500
<i>"John Doe"</i>

10:53.542 --> 10:56.375
<i>from the emergency</i>

10:53.542 --> 10:56.375
<i>bio-support unit.</i>

10:56.417 --> 10:59.375
<i>In just 36 hours, most of</i>

10:56.417 --> 10:59.375
<i>his major organ systems</i>

10:59.417 --> 11:01.166
<i>have regenerated themselves</i>

11:01.208 --> 11:04.625
<i>to the point where they can</i>

11:01.208 --> 11:04.625
<i>now function on their own.</i>

11:12.750 --> 11:14.125
(<i> gasps</i> )

11:19.959 --> 11:21.709
(<i> sighs</i> )

11:25.125 --> 11:28.625
I am... alive.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.000
You certainly are.

11:32.583 --> 11:35.166
Thank you for my life.

11:37.542 --> 11:40.250
Tell me...

11:40.291 --> 11:42.792
who am I?

11:47.834 --> 11:52.542
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

11:47.834 --> 11:52.542
<i>Stardate 43960.6.</i>

11:52.583 --> 11:55.125
<i>Our mission to map</i>

11:52.583 --> 11:55.125
<i>the Zeta Gelis Star Cluster</i>

11:55.166 --> 11:57.041
<i>is proceeding on schedule.</i>

11:57.083 --> 11:58.959
<i>Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher reports</i>

11:59.000 --> 12:02.166
<i>that the recovery of the</i>

11:59.000 --> 12:02.166
<i>patient she has named John Doe</i>

12:02.208 --> 12:04.375
<i>continues at a remarkable pace.</i>

12:11.709 --> 12:14.250
Are you experiencing

12:11.709 --> 12:14.250
any discomfort?

12:16.417 --> 12:18.542
None.

12:18.583 --> 12:21.250
I can feel the life

12:18.583 --> 12:21.250
returning to my body.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.000
Your neurofibrowaves

12:23.041 --> 12:25.291
are functioning

12:23.041 --> 12:25.291
almost normally again.

12:25.333 --> 12:29.959
That puts you about six weeks

12:25.333 --> 12:29.959
ahead of my original schedule.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.834
That should give you

12:30.000 --> 12:31.834
and your colleagues

12:31.875 --> 12:33.166
something to talk about.

12:33.208 --> 12:34.959
You are all

12:33.208 --> 12:34.959
we've talked about

12:35.000 --> 12:38.208
since your arrival.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.750
I believe I'm ready for the

12:38.250 --> 12:40.750
next phase of my treatment.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.709
You are right.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.709
It is about time

12:42.750 --> 12:45.375
you stopped taking up

12:42.750 --> 12:45.375
valuable bed space.

12:45.417 --> 12:48.750
Now, these motor-assist

12:45.417 --> 12:48.750
bands will provide you

12:48.792 --> 12:52.875
with electrical stimulation

12:48.792 --> 12:52.875
for your arms and legs.

12:52.917 --> 12:54.333
They will help you

12:52.917 --> 12:54.333
to relearn

12:54.375 --> 12:56.417
how to control

12:54.375 --> 12:56.417
your muscles again.

12:56.458 --> 12:59.917
But remember, you've been off

12:56.458 --> 12:59.917
your feet for almost a month.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.875
So, don't be disappointed

13:01.917 --> 13:04.250
if at first your mobility

13:01.917 --> 13:04.250
is restricted.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.709
Your limbs are still weak.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.667
I appreciate your

13:06.750 --> 13:08.667
concern, Doctor,

13:08.709 --> 13:13.208
but I think I may

13:08.709 --> 13:13.208
surprise you again.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.959
I feel strong enough to fly.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.125
Whoa.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.625
Perhaps I should concentrate

13:28.750 --> 13:31.625
on walking first.

13:31.667 --> 13:35.542
Let's try it again, but a

13:31.667 --> 13:35.542
little more slowly this time.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.583
Much more slowly.

14:11.041 --> 14:13.917
I envy your

14:11.041 --> 14:13.917
reflexes, Captain.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.959
I envy your strength of will.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.417
Dr. Crusher has been keeping me

14:16.041 --> 14:18.417
informed of your progress.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.709
It's really quite extraordinary.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.000
I have an

14:20.750 --> 14:23.000
extraordinary doctor.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.208
Oh...

14:24.250 --> 14:26.458
She gave me

14:24.250 --> 14:26.458
back my life.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.792
I hope that I am worthy

14:26.500 --> 14:29.792
of her efforts.

14:32.500 --> 14:36.500
Are you still unable to recall

14:32.500 --> 14:36.500
anything about your past?

14:40.709 --> 14:42.291
Unfortunately,

14:40.709 --> 14:42.291
Captain,

14:42.333 --> 14:46.291
my memories begin the moment

14:42.333 --> 14:46.291
I woke up in Sick Bay.

14:48.333 --> 14:51.542
Dr. Crusher told me you think

14:48.333 --> 14:51.542
I was in some kind of battle.

14:51.583 --> 14:52.792
PICARD: We're quite

14:51.583 --> 14:52.792
sure of that.

14:52.834 --> 14:54.083
Have you any idea

14:54.125 --> 14:56.291
how you came to be

14:54.125 --> 14:56.291
in that escape pod,

14:56.333 --> 14:58.458
or what happened

14:56.333 --> 14:58.458
to the ship?

14:58.500 --> 14:59.750
No.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.041
Believe me, Captain,

15:01.041 --> 15:03.041
it's a horrible feeling

15:03.083 --> 15:06.291
not knowing who you are,

15:03.083 --> 15:06.291
where you're from.

15:06.333 --> 15:09.291
Have you tried

15:06.333 --> 15:09.291
synaptic induction?

15:09.333 --> 15:12.250
His neural nets don't conform

15:09.333 --> 15:12.250
to any known patterns.

15:12.291 --> 15:16.125
Conventional neurotherapy

15:12.291 --> 15:16.125
has proven ineffective.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.250
Hopefully, in time,

15:16.166 --> 15:18.250
his memory pathways

15:18.291 --> 15:21.041
will reestablish

15:18.291 --> 15:21.041
themselves naturally.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.041
That same pain?

15:25.083 --> 15:26.291
Yes.

15:29.125 --> 15:32.417
I think I've made

15:29.125 --> 15:32.417
enough progress for one day.

15:32.458 --> 15:34.000
Not a relapse, I hope.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.750
This has nothing to do

15:34.041 --> 15:36.750
with his previous wounds.

15:36.792 --> 15:38.417
I think this has

15:36.792 --> 15:38.417
something to do

15:38.458 --> 15:40.792
with the continuing mutation

15:38.458 --> 15:40.792
of his cell structure.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.792
And you still have no theory

15:40.834 --> 15:42.792
as to what's causing it?

15:42.834 --> 15:44.834
It doesn't make any sense.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.542
I seem to be

15:44.875 --> 15:47.542
a mystery, Doctor.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.417
To you...

15:49.458 --> 15:51.375
and to myself.

16:00.792 --> 16:01.917
(<i> clears throat</i> )

16:01.959 --> 16:04.750
Well, this is where I get off.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.333
See you tonight

16:04.792 --> 16:06.333
in Ten-Forward?

16:06.375 --> 16:09.709
Yeah, I'll be there.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.291
Hello, Commander.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.959
Miss Henshaw.

16:17.208 --> 16:19.083
Bridge.

16:19.125 --> 16:21.458
Deck six.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.458
So, you and Miss Henshaw

16:23.500 --> 16:24.750
have been seeing

16:23.500 --> 16:24.750
a lot of each other.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.667
Every night this week.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.667
Is that all?

16:26.709 --> 16:28.083
I thought you'd been walking

16:26.709 --> 16:28.083
around with that smile

16:28.125 --> 16:30.792
on your face a lot

16:28.125 --> 16:30.792
longer than that.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.792
Well, I guess I have.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.792
This whole last month or so,

16:33.834 --> 16:35.750
everything seems

16:33.834 --> 16:35.750
to be going my way.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.083
I don't know what it is,

16:35.792 --> 16:37.083
but something

16:37.125 --> 16:38.500
sure has

16:37.125 --> 16:38.500
changed around here.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.291
The only thing

16:38.542 --> 16:40.291
that's changed is you.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.208
Me?

16:42.250 --> 16:44.000
I'm the same old

16:42.250 --> 16:44.000
guy I always was.

16:44.041 --> 16:45.500
If you say so.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.041
I don't remember

16:45.542 --> 16:47.041
the old Geordi having

16:47.083 --> 16:50.458
that much success with

16:47.083 --> 16:50.458
Miss Christy Henshaw.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.917
(<i> chuckles</i> )

16:51.959 --> 16:55.291
Well, maybe I am

16:51.959 --> 16:55.291
a little bit more confident

16:55.333 --> 16:56.750
than I used to be.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.333
What happened to you?

17:11.375 --> 17:14.417
I was kayaking in

17:11.375 --> 17:14.417
the holodeck again.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.792
You dislocated

17:17.875 --> 17:20.792
your shoulder.

17:20.834 --> 17:24.417
Sit down, I'll get the

17:20.834 --> 17:24.417
osteotractor frame.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.750
Hi, Mom.

17:25.792 --> 17:27.000
We still on

17:25.792 --> 17:27.000
for dinner tonight?

17:27.041 --> 17:29.250
7:30 sharp.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.250
I'll be right back.

17:29.291 --> 17:30.834
(<i> whimpers in pain</i> )

17:30.875 --> 17:32.500
Kayaking again?

17:32.542 --> 17:35.208
Yeah.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.041
How's my mom's

17:35.250 --> 17:37.041
favorite patient?

17:37.083 --> 17:38.834
Judge for yourself.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.709
Not bad.

17:43.750 --> 17:47.750
Your mom promised me

17:43.750 --> 17:47.750
a tour of the ship tomorrow.

17:47.792 --> 17:50.083
You may find this hard

17:47.792 --> 17:50.083
to believe, but Sick Bay

17:50.125 --> 17:52.834
can be an incredibly

17:50.125 --> 17:52.834
boring place to be.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.125
O'BRIEN:

17:52.875 --> 17:54.125
Hey, Doc!

17:54.166 --> 17:56.125
I'm dying out here.

18:01.792 --> 18:04.709
Don't worry, my friend.

18:01.792 --> 18:04.709
You'll be all right.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.542
The pain's gone.

18:16.792 --> 18:19.500
It's completely healed.

18:19.542 --> 18:22.041
I don't understand.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.166
What did you do?

18:23.208 --> 18:25.125
I don't know.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.875
It was instinct.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.875
I just touched him.

18:39.667 --> 18:43.917
I've run every test and scan

18:39.667 --> 18:43.917
on him that I can think of.

18:43.959 --> 18:46.709
And yet, there's

18:43.959 --> 18:46.709
no physiological evidence

18:46.750 --> 18:50.625
to indicate that he would

18:46.750 --> 18:50.625
possess such powers.

18:50.667 --> 18:54.083
But then, there's so much

18:50.667 --> 18:54.083
about John that's a mystery.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.250
You know,

18:54.125 --> 18:56.250
I really like him.

18:56.291 --> 18:59.083
He does have a certain charm,

18:56.291 --> 18:59.083
doesn't he?

18:59.125 --> 19:03.375
The entire medical staff

18:59.125 --> 19:03.375
has commented on it.

19:03.417 --> 19:07.041
You seem a little taken

19:03.417 --> 19:07.041
with him yourself.

19:07.083 --> 19:11.959
He has a strength and serenity

19:07.083 --> 19:11.959
that I find very attractive.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.667
And yet,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.667
he's vulnerable.

19:14.709 --> 19:18.834
I guess I find him...

19:14.709 --> 19:18.834
intriguing.

19:18.875 --> 19:21.959
Seems like there's a little

19:18.875 --> 19:21.959
more to it than that.

19:23.208 --> 19:24.834
Is this your way of asking me

19:24.875 --> 19:27.000
if I'm getting

19:24.875 --> 19:27.000
romantically involved with him?

19:27.041 --> 19:29.291
You said it, I didn't.

19:29.333 --> 19:34.083
My feelings towards him

19:29.333 --> 19:34.083
aren't romantic...

19:34.125 --> 19:35.834
exactly.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.792
I mean, I know that

19:35.875 --> 19:39.792
the doctor-patient relationship

19:39.834 --> 19:42.208
can sometimes create

19:39.834 --> 19:42.208
a false sense of intimacy,

19:42.250 --> 19:47.041
but this... is different.

19:47.083 --> 19:51.625
There's an almost

19:47.083 --> 19:51.625
spiritual connection.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.333
(<i> sighs</i> )

19:51.667 --> 19:53.333
I guess I'm not making

19:53.375 --> 19:55.166
any sense, am I?

19:56.250 --> 19:58.333
I think I understand.

20:08.417 --> 20:12.000
Data, I was thinking about

20:08.417 --> 20:12.000
the storage capsule last night,

20:12.041 --> 20:13.959
and I was wondering.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.625
What if we've been going

20:14.000 --> 20:16.625
about this thing the wrong way?

20:16.667 --> 20:19.500
We've been trying to analyze

20:16.667 --> 20:19.500
its mechanical properties.

20:19.542 --> 20:22.000
What if it's a biochemical

20:19.542 --> 20:22.000
storage medium?

20:22.041 --> 20:23.834
Are you suggesting

20:22.041 --> 20:23.834
that it employs

20:23.875 --> 20:26.000
memory RNA, like

20:23.875 --> 20:26.000
an organic cell?

20:26.041 --> 20:28.792
Well, it<i> does</i> contain

20:26.041 --> 20:28.792
quantities of nucleic acids.

20:28.834 --> 20:31.250
Perhaps the information

20:28.834 --> 20:31.250
sequences are encoded

20:31.291 --> 20:33.000
in the molecular

20:31.291 --> 20:33.000
patterns themselves.

20:33.041 --> 20:35.875
Computer, scan

20:33.041 --> 20:35.875
the storage capsule.

20:35.917 --> 20:39.625
Analyze molecular sequences

20:35.917 --> 20:39.625
on nucleic acid chains.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.041
Well, what do you know?

20:42.500 --> 20:46.041
A navigational chart.

20:46.083 --> 20:49.041
It appears that your hypothesis

20:46.083 --> 20:49.041
was correct, Geordi.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.166
I knew it.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.166
Captain!

20:51.208 --> 20:52.542
You found something?

20:52.583 --> 20:54.208
We've determined that

20:52.583 --> 20:54.208
the storage capsule

20:54.250 --> 20:55.583
from John Doe's

20:54.250 --> 20:55.583
escape pod

20:55.625 --> 20:57.875
contains navigational

20:55.625 --> 20:57.875
information.

20:57.917 --> 21:00.375
Can you match these stars

20:57.917 --> 21:00.375
to our charts?

21:00.417 --> 21:04.291
Computer, run transformational

21:00.417 --> 21:04.291
matrix calculations.

21:04.333 --> 21:08.667
Match navigational referents

21:04.333 --> 21:08.667
to known stars in this sector.

21:08.709 --> 21:11.417
COMPUTER: Information on

21:08.709 --> 21:11.417
this sector is incomplete.

21:11.458 --> 21:12.959
No correlation.

21:13.041 --> 21:14.875
I'm not giving up yet,

21:13.041 --> 21:14.875
not after coming so close

21:14.917 --> 21:16.667
to cracking this thing.

21:16.709 --> 21:20.667
You know, that might be

21:16.709 --> 21:20.667
flight path information

21:20.709 --> 21:22.291
from John's ship, but without

21:20.709 --> 21:22.291
a frame of reference,

21:22.333 --> 21:25.417
I can't determine

21:22.333 --> 21:25.417
its origin points.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.834
Computer, assume those paths

21:25.458 --> 21:28.834
are course corrections

21:28.875 --> 21:30.667
and derive

21:28.875 --> 21:30.667
gravitational values

21:30.709 --> 21:33.333
for stellar objects near

21:30.709 --> 21:33.333
those flight paths.

21:36.667 --> 21:39.458
Most of these are

21:36.667 --> 21:39.458
ordinary G-type stars.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.375
This would appear to be

21:39.500 --> 21:42.375
a neutron star,

21:42.417 --> 21:43.959
possibly a pulsar.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.542
LA FORGE:

21:44.000 --> 21:45.542
Which means that this

21:45.583 --> 21:47.792
might be a rotational

21:45.583 --> 21:47.792
time reference.

21:47.834 --> 21:51.959
Computer, assume these symbols

21:47.834 --> 21:51.959
are pulsars.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.667
Translate associated values

21:53.709 --> 21:55.750
into standard

21:53.709 --> 21:55.750
temporal notations.

21:57.291 --> 22:01.166
Computer, is there a pulsar

21:57.291 --> 22:01.166
with a rotational period

22:01.208 --> 22:05.208
of 1.5244 seconds

22:01.208 --> 22:05.208
within sensor range?

22:05.250 --> 22:06.709
COMPUTER:

22:05.250 --> 22:06.709
Affirmative.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.792
Bingo!

22:06.750 --> 22:08.792
Now, Computer,

22:08.834 --> 22:11.250
overlay navigational chart

22:08.834 --> 22:11.250
using referenced pulsars

22:11.291 --> 22:13.291
and project a flight path

22:11.291 --> 22:13.291
back to its origin.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.375
COMPUTER:

22:15.041 --> 22:16.375
Flight path originated

22:16.417 --> 22:20.625
at bearing 003, mark 015.

22:20.667 --> 22:23.834
Distance, 2.3 parsecs.

22:23.875 --> 22:24.875
That's it, Captain.

22:24.917 --> 22:26.667
That's where John Doe

22:24.917 --> 22:26.667
came from.

22:26.709 --> 22:29.458
That bearing is almost directly

22:26.709 --> 22:29.458
along our planned course, sir.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.834
Good. Then, we can

22:29.500 --> 22:31.834
continue our mission

22:31.875 --> 22:33.875
without significant

22:31.875 --> 22:33.875
interruption.

22:45.834 --> 22:47.709
Home?

22:45.834 --> 22:47.709
PICARD: Yes.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.709
Using the information

22:47.750 --> 22:49.709
we found in your escape pod,

22:49.750 --> 22:51.792
we may be able to return

22:49.750 --> 22:51.792
you to your people.

22:54.083 --> 22:56.166
I cannot go back.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.083
Why is that?

22:59.125 --> 23:01.834
You must not take

22:59.125 --> 23:01.834
me home, Captain.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.166
CRUSHER:

23:01.875 --> 23:03.166
John?

23:03.208 --> 23:04.917
Your memory--

23:03.208 --> 23:04.917
has it returned?

23:04.959 --> 23:07.417
All I know is that

23:04.959 --> 23:07.417
we came out here to escape.

23:07.458 --> 23:08.375
Escape?

23:08.417 --> 23:09.542
There were others with you?

23:09.583 --> 23:12.041
Yes, I was not alone.

23:14.083 --> 23:18.083
But what happened to the others,

23:18.125 --> 23:22.000
or what we were escaping from,

23:18.125 --> 23:22.000
I cannot remember.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.375
But I do know

23:25.000 --> 23:27.375
you must not take me back.

23:27.417 --> 23:29.333
Not yet!

23:32.083 --> 23:33.500
We'll not arrive

23:32.083 --> 23:33.500
in your star system

23:33.542 --> 23:35.333
for at least three weeks.

23:35.375 --> 23:38.834
That will give us plenty of

23:35.375 --> 23:38.834
time to discuss this further.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.792
Hopefully, by then,

23:38.875 --> 23:40.792
you will have regained

23:40.834 --> 23:42.166
more of your memory.

23:42.208 --> 23:45.375
You're right.

23:42.208 --> 23:45.375
Of course, Captain.

23:45.417 --> 23:47.625
I apologize for my outburst.

23:47.667 --> 23:50.417
It's...

23:50.458 --> 23:52.375
it's understandable.

23:53.709 --> 23:57.417
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

23:59.375 --> 24:02.458
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

24:06.458 --> 24:08.083
(<i> gasps</i> )

24:24.000 --> 24:27.458
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

24:30.917 --> 24:32.750
This ship is astounding.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.250
It seems to stretch on

24:32.792 --> 24:35.250
without end.

24:35.291 --> 24:37.750
We can see the rest

24:35.291 --> 24:37.750
of it some other time.

24:37.792 --> 24:39.375
This is your first day

24:37.792 --> 24:39.375
out of Sick Bay,

24:39.417 --> 24:43.542
and I don't want you

24:39.417 --> 24:43.542
to overexert yourself.

24:43.583 --> 24:47.000
This looks like

24:43.583 --> 24:47.000
an ideal place to rest.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.583
My thoughts exactly.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.041
Truly remarkable.

25:05.083 --> 25:06.959
What is?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.875
These people.

25:08.917 --> 25:10.417
They're all so different

25:08.917 --> 25:10.417
from one another,

25:10.458 --> 25:12.291
and yet, they work

25:10.458 --> 25:12.291
together freely.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.667
That surprises you?

25:13.709 --> 25:17.625
It is... new to me.

25:19.083 --> 25:23.166
My people are different somehow.

25:23.208 --> 25:25.250
If only I could remember.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.959
Yesterday...

25:30.000 --> 25:34.041
for one... terrifying moment,

25:30.000 --> 25:34.041
there was clarity.

25:34.083 --> 25:35.625
You mean, the energy pulse?

25:35.667 --> 25:38.250
Yes.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.250
For that moment,

25:38.291 --> 25:41.000
my purpose seemed clear.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.625
And then it was gone.

25:48.917 --> 25:52.458
The pain... the energy pulse...

25:52.500 --> 25:56.625
must be linked to the cell

25:52.500 --> 25:56.625
mutation in the body.

25:56.667 --> 26:00.250
Oh, I wish I could

25:56.667 --> 26:00.250
help you find the truth.

26:01.750 --> 26:04.417
Beverly, you've done

26:01.750 --> 26:04.417
so much for me.

26:04.458 --> 26:07.250
I only wish there was some way

26:04.458 --> 26:07.250
I could repay you.

26:07.291 --> 26:08.792
But you have.

26:08.834 --> 26:13.125
The friendship we've developed

26:08.834 --> 26:13.125
has made me very happy.

26:14.792 --> 26:16.917
The rapport

26:14.792 --> 26:16.917
that exists between us

26:16.959 --> 26:20.000
also means a great deal to me.

26:20.041 --> 26:23.875
But... I am on some

26:20.041 --> 26:23.875
kind of a journey.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.083
Whatever brought me here...

26:28.125 --> 26:31.750
whatever is happening

26:28.125 --> 26:31.750
to my body,

26:31.792 --> 26:34.500
is all part of that journey.

26:36.750 --> 26:40.041
And I must complete it...

26:40.083 --> 26:43.458
before...

26:40.083 --> 26:43.458
any other consideration.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.917
(<i> console beeping</i> )

26:52.959 --> 26:56.083
Sir, I am reading a vessel

26:52.959 --> 26:56.083
on long-range scanners.

26:56.125 --> 26:58.709
It is coming from Sector 9569.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.417
What configuration?

27:01.458 --> 27:03.917
Impossible to identify

27:01.458 --> 27:03.917
at this distance.

27:03.959 --> 27:06.625
However, it<i> is</i>

27:03.959 --> 27:06.625
on an intercept course.

27:06.667 --> 27:10.500
Captain, the ship is

27:06.667 --> 27:10.500
traveling at warp 9.72.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.500
Warp 9.72?

27:12.542 --> 27:14.083
Time till intercept?

27:14.125 --> 27:17.625
At present course and speed,

27:14.125 --> 27:17.625
ten hours, 53 minutes.

27:17.667 --> 27:19.208
Try and hail them, Mr. Worf.

27:21.083 --> 27:23.709
No response, Captain.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.500
Keep monitoring their approach.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.500
Repeat the hail

27:25.542 --> 27:27.625
every half an hour.

27:25.542 --> 27:27.625
Aye, sir.

27:27.667 --> 27:30.458
Whoever they are, they're

27:27.667 --> 27:30.458
in a big hurry to get here.

27:44.125 --> 27:47.500
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

27:47.542 --> 27:50.709
Dr. Crusher, medical emergency,

27:47.542 --> 27:50.709
room four.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.458
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

27:55.875 --> 27:58.417
I can't make it stop.

28:04.959 --> 28:07.375
John, tell me, is it

28:04.959 --> 28:07.375
worse than before?

28:07.417 --> 28:08.959
Much worse.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.417
Should I get something

28:09.000 --> 28:10.417
for the pain?

28:10.458 --> 28:12.542
No, the readings are

28:10.458 --> 28:12.542
fluctuating too wildly.

28:12.583 --> 28:14.041
Besides, it wouldn't

28:12.583 --> 28:14.041
do any good.

28:14.083 --> 28:16.375
His entire cell structure

28:14.083 --> 28:16.375
is transforming.

28:16.417 --> 28:18.041
I have to leave, Beverly.

28:18.083 --> 28:20.000
John, where do

28:18.083 --> 28:20.000
you have to go?

28:20.041 --> 28:22.667
I must get off this ship.

28:22.709 --> 28:25.542
That's impossible.

28:22.709 --> 28:25.542
Not in your condition.

28:25.583 --> 28:27.000
I must!

28:41.041 --> 28:42.500
Security.

28:54.792 --> 28:56.667
Okay, let's realign

28:54.792 --> 28:56.667
the magnetic inducer

28:56.709 --> 28:58.458
on the starboard nacelle.

29:16.333 --> 29:18.333
(<i> groaning</i> )

29:28.250 --> 29:30.375
John.

29:32.291 --> 29:35.083
Leave the control booth

29:32.291 --> 29:35.083
immediately!

29:47.667 --> 29:50.667
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

29:54.041 --> 29:56.083
John, listen to me.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.000
You must come down.

29:58.041 --> 29:59.875
I'll try to help you.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.667
Step away from

30:01.166 --> 30:03.667
the controls.

30:16.834 --> 30:19.291
Get back.

30:16.834 --> 30:19.291
Please, stay away.

30:19.333 --> 30:21.834
I have no wish to harm you,

30:21.875 --> 30:24.333
but you must return

30:21.875 --> 30:24.333
to Sick Bay immediately.

30:24.375 --> 30:27.500
No. Do not come

30:24.375 --> 30:27.500
any closer.

30:27.542 --> 30:30.417
I cannot control what

30:27.542 --> 30:30.417
is happening to me.

30:30.458 --> 30:33.333
(<i> yells</i> )

30:40.458 --> 30:41.875
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

30:41.917 --> 30:43.417
(<i> steady tone</i> )

30:43.458 --> 30:46.083
His neck is broken.

30:43.458 --> 30:46.083
No life signs.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.000
Sick Bay, form a

30:47.667 --> 30:49.000
resuscitation team.

30:49.041 --> 30:50.709
I have a code seven

30:49.041 --> 30:50.709
in Shuttle Bay Two.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.875
Transporter room, stand by.

30:52.917 --> 30:54.333
Hold it!

30:52.917 --> 30:54.333
No, don't.

31:03.709 --> 31:06.458
(<i> inhales sharply</i> )

31:12.875 --> 31:14.000
Hold still.

31:14.041 --> 31:15.458
LA FORGE:

31:14.041 --> 31:15.458
Doc?

31:17.375 --> 31:19.291
I can't

31:17.375 --> 31:19.291
believe it.

31:21.875 --> 31:24.083
There's no trace of injury.

31:33.375 --> 31:36.291
You admit you were trying

31:33.375 --> 31:36.291
to steal a shuttlecraft.

31:36.333 --> 31:37.500
JOHN:

31:36.333 --> 31:37.500
Yes.

31:37.542 --> 31:40.792
So, I ask you again, why?

31:40.834 --> 31:41.959
I don't know.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.417
Unacceptable.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.417
You had a reason.

31:43.458 --> 31:45.375
I want to know

31:43.458 --> 31:45.375
what it was.

31:45.417 --> 31:47.291
Damn it, you nearly killed

31:45.417 --> 31:47.291
a member of my crew.

31:47.333 --> 31:48.834
And healed him.

31:47.333 --> 31:48.834
I'm not forgetting that.

31:48.875 --> 31:51.166
That's the reason he's

31:48.875 --> 31:51.166
here and not in the Brig.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.375
I warned him.

31:52.417 --> 31:54.000
Told him it was dangerous.

31:54.041 --> 31:56.792
Why?

31:54.041 --> 31:56.792
Why was it dangerous?

31:56.834 --> 31:59.834
What is happening

31:56.834 --> 31:59.834
to you?

31:59.875 --> 32:01.625
I don't know.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.625
The rate of metamorphosis

32:03.083 --> 32:05.625
is accelerating.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.417
It's almost as if

32:05.667 --> 32:07.417
your body is generating

32:07.458 --> 32:10.542
an electrical field that's

32:07.458 --> 32:10.542
warping the tissue.

32:12.667 --> 32:16.000
Who are you?

32:12.667 --> 32:16.000
What are you?

32:16.959 --> 32:19.125
I'm afraid...

32:19.166 --> 32:23.208
for myself, for all of you.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.542
I have to get away.

32:26.583 --> 32:29.083
Isolate myself.

32:29.125 --> 32:32.542
Whatever is happening to me,

32:29.125 --> 32:32.542
it's dangerous.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.709
As Lieutenant Worf discovered.

32:34.750 --> 32:38.583
I don't want to hurt anyone.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.625
Captain, for the sake

32:38.625 --> 32:40.625
of your crew,

32:40.667 --> 32:43.458
let me go

32:40.667 --> 32:43.458
before this happens again.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.500
John, I don't believe you're

32:43.500 --> 32:46.500
capable of harming any--

32:46.542 --> 32:48.625
DATA: Captain.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.625
The alien vessel is coming

32:48.667 --> 32:51.291
within weapon's range.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.291
Its shields are up.

32:51.333 --> 32:52.709
I'm on my way.

32:52.750 --> 32:55.041
I want him kept under

32:52.750 --> 32:55.041
constant surveillance.

33:00.125 --> 33:01.583
John.

33:02.875 --> 33:05.417
I really want

33:02.875 --> 33:05.417
to thank you.

33:05.458 --> 33:07.166
For what?

33:07.208 --> 33:09.041
I don't know how,

33:07.208 --> 33:09.041
or even why,

33:09.083 --> 33:11.083
but down on the planet,

33:09.083 --> 33:11.083
you gave me something--

33:11.125 --> 33:15.041
a... well,

33:11.125 --> 33:15.041
a new confidence.

33:15.083 --> 33:18.083
I doubt I can take

33:15.083 --> 33:18.083
credit for that.

33:18.125 --> 33:21.917
Perhaps I only helped you

33:18.125 --> 33:21.917
find something you already had.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.917
DATA:

33:26.875 --> 33:28.917
Captain, on screen.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.750
Alien vessel approaching

33:30.709 --> 33:33.750
at half-impulse, sir.

33:33.792 --> 33:37.542
Heading 051, mark 114.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.834
Raise shields.

33:38.875 --> 33:40.709
Slow to one-third

33:38.875 --> 33:40.709
impulse power.

33:40.750 --> 33:43.500
Bring us to 103, mark 025.

33:43.542 --> 33:46.834
Mr. Worf,

33:43.542 --> 33:46.834
hail the alien vessel.

33:46.875 --> 33:49.792
They continue

33:46.875 --> 33:49.792
to ignore our hail, sir.

33:49.834 --> 33:52.208
DATA:

33:49.834 --> 33:52.208
They are scanning us, sir.

33:52.250 --> 33:54.500
They are answering our hail,

33:52.250 --> 33:54.500
Captain.

33:54.542 --> 33:56.000
On screen.

33:57.583 --> 33:59.709
JOHN:

33:57.583 --> 33:59.709
Sunad.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.458
You know him?

34:07.500 --> 34:08.792
Yes.

34:08.834 --> 34:12.709
I don't know how,

34:08.834 --> 34:12.709
but... he's dangerous.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.166
I am Commander

34:16.500 --> 34:19.166
Sunad of Zalkon.

34:19.208 --> 34:22.542
You are trespassing

34:19.208 --> 34:22.542
into our space

34:22.583 --> 34:24.917
and you are holding

34:22.583 --> 34:24.917
a Zalkonian citizen.

34:24.959 --> 34:26.333
I'm Captain

34:24.959 --> 34:26.333
Jean-Luc Picard

34:26.375 --> 34:28.125
of the United Federation

34:26.375 --> 34:28.125
of Planets.

34:28.166 --> 34:29.834
We do not intend

34:28.166 --> 34:29.834
transgression of--

34:29.875 --> 34:33.667
You will return him

34:29.875 --> 34:33.667
to us immediately.

34:33.709 --> 34:36.792
Sunad, this individual

34:33.709 --> 34:36.792
is a guest aboard our ship.

34:36.834 --> 34:38.333
We found him dying

34:36.834 --> 34:38.333
in a shipwreck.

34:38.375 --> 34:39.667
We have returned him to health.

34:41.083 --> 34:43.625
Then you aided a criminal.

34:43.667 --> 34:46.208
He is one of four

34:43.667 --> 34:46.208
escaped prisoners.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.792
We eliminated

34:46.250 --> 34:48.792
the other three.

34:48.834 --> 34:50.917
We thought this one

34:48.834 --> 34:50.917
dead as well.

34:50.959 --> 34:54.333
Return him

34:50.959 --> 34:54.333
so we may complete our task.

34:54.375 --> 34:55.917
Of what is he accused?

34:55.959 --> 34:58.583
He is a disruptive

34:55.959 --> 34:58.583
influence.

34:58.625 --> 35:00.542
He spreads lies.

35:00.583 --> 35:02.375
He encourages dissent.

35:02.417 --> 35:05.458
He disturbs the natural order

35:02.417 --> 35:05.458
of our society.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.166
In what way?

35:07.208 --> 35:09.291
That is not your concern!

35:09.333 --> 35:12.208
I will give you

35:09.333 --> 35:12.208
two hours to comply.

35:13.166 --> 35:15.208
RIKER:

35:13.166 --> 35:15.208
Tactical analysis.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.875
The Zalkonian ship

35:15.250 --> 35:17.875
has a formidable armament.

35:17.917 --> 35:19.875
Their weaponry

35:17.917 --> 35:19.875
is comparable to ours.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.333
They're as fast

35:19.917 --> 35:21.333
as the<i> Enterprise</i>

35:21.375 --> 35:24.000
and probably just

35:21.375 --> 35:24.000
as maneuverable.

35:24.041 --> 35:26.250
Counselor, do they mean

35:24.041 --> 35:26.250
to carry out their threat?

35:26.291 --> 35:28.500
I believe so.

35:28.542 --> 35:31.417
Sunad's hatred

35:28.542 --> 35:31.417
for John was evident,

35:31.458 --> 35:33.792
but there's

35:31.458 --> 35:33.792
something else.

35:33.834 --> 35:36.542
The Zalkonians

35:33.834 --> 35:36.542
are afraid of John.

35:37.667 --> 35:39.458
Commander Riker,

35:37.667 --> 35:39.458
Counselor, Doctor.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.166
John, I want you

35:39.500 --> 35:41.166
to join us.

35:41.208 --> 35:43.750
Mr. Data, you have the Bridge.

35:41.208 --> 35:43.750
Mr. Worf, stay at Tactical.

35:43.792 --> 35:45.500
Counter any moves

35:43.792 --> 35:45.500
the Zalkonian makes.

35:45.542 --> 35:46.959
WORF:

35:45.542 --> 35:46.959
Aye, sir.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.375
I can neither

35:51.291 --> 35:53.375
confirm nor deny

35:53.417 --> 35:55.875
what the Zalkonians

35:53.417 --> 35:55.875
told you.

35:55.917 --> 35:59.750
They make serious

35:55.917 --> 35:59.750
accusations against you.

35:59.792 --> 36:01.500
Their accusations

35:59.792 --> 36:01.500
may be true.

36:01.542 --> 36:04.208
I don't know.

36:04.250 --> 36:06.750
I don't believe

36:04.250 --> 36:06.750
that I am a criminal.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.333
You understand the

36:06.792 --> 36:08.333
difficult position

36:08.375 --> 36:11.208
in which I am placed.

36:11.250 --> 36:13.291
Completely.

36:13.333 --> 36:16.375
And I refuse to place

36:13.333 --> 36:16.375
your ship in danger.

36:19.291 --> 36:22.125
If necessary, I will

36:19.291 --> 36:22.125
surrender to them.

36:23.792 --> 36:25.083
But I am convinced

36:25.125 --> 36:29.208
there is more at stake

36:25.125 --> 36:29.208
here than my life.

36:29.250 --> 36:33.750
There's something...

36:29.250 --> 36:33.750
important I must complete.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.875
My survival is vital.

36:40.500 --> 36:44.458
(<i> sighs</i> )

36:40.500 --> 36:44.458
If I could explain it, I would.

36:51.041 --> 36:54.083
I'll inform you of

36:51.041 --> 36:54.083
my decision shortly.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.792
Captain, you can't

37:02.959 --> 37:04.792
seriously be considering--

37:04.834 --> 37:07.166
We must consider all options,

37:04.834 --> 37:07.166
Doctor, and not let

37:07.208 --> 37:09.834
our personal feelings

37:07.208 --> 37:09.834
impede our judgment.

37:09.875 --> 37:11.166
You're going to

37:09.875 --> 37:11.166
tell me it's irrelevant

37:11.208 --> 37:12.792
that we'll be sending

37:11.208 --> 37:12.792
him to his death?

37:12.834 --> 37:15.000
Whether we approve of the

37:12.834 --> 37:15.000
Zalkonians' intentions

37:15.041 --> 37:17.583
is not the issue.

37:17.625 --> 37:22.500
But for what it's worth,

37:17.625 --> 37:22.500
I believe that John is correct,

37:22.542 --> 37:25.667
that his existence

37:22.542 --> 37:25.667
has broader ramifications

37:25.709 --> 37:27.375
than that of a simple criminal.

37:27.417 --> 37:29.250
TROI:

37:27.417 --> 37:29.250
Sunad thinks so.

37:29.291 --> 37:31.750
He feels personally

37:29.291 --> 37:31.750
threatened by John.

37:31.792 --> 37:34.166
Sunad called John a

37:31.792 --> 37:34.166
"disruptive influence."

37:34.208 --> 37:36.125
That's hardly a capital offense.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.542
It's not up to us

37:36.166 --> 37:38.542
to judge their laws, Doctor.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.250
RIKER: I know how I would

37:38.583 --> 37:40.250
feel if the situation

37:40.291 --> 37:42.583
were reversed-- if they

37:40.291 --> 37:42.583
were in our territory

37:42.625 --> 37:44.542
holding a Federation citizen.

37:44.583 --> 37:46.792
The Zalkonians truly

37:44.583 --> 37:46.792
don't understand

37:46.834 --> 37:49.667
our indecision

37:46.834 --> 37:49.667
about returning John.

37:49.709 --> 37:52.458
In their eyes, we shouldn't

37:49.709 --> 37:52.458
even be involved.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.875
But we<i> are</i> involved.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.125
I saved his life.

37:57.166 --> 38:00.166
For what? So that they

37:57.166 --> 38:00.166
could chase him down

38:00.208 --> 38:02.291
and take away that life again?

38:13.667 --> 38:16.417
Picard, we will not tolerate

38:13.667 --> 38:16.417
more delays.

38:16.458 --> 38:19.458
Commander,

38:16.458 --> 38:19.458
let me remind you,

38:19.500 --> 38:21.917
we are on a mission

38:19.500 --> 38:21.917
of exploration.

38:21.959 --> 38:24.417
Our purpose is to establish

38:21.959 --> 38:24.417
peaceful relations

38:24.458 --> 38:25.959
with the civilizations

38:24.458 --> 38:25.959
we encounter.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.667
We do not want

38:26.000 --> 38:28.667
relations with you.

38:28.709 --> 38:31.500
If that is your wish,

38:28.709 --> 38:31.500
we will respect it.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.667
We simply want you

38:31.542 --> 38:34.667
to leave Zalkonian space

38:34.709 --> 38:36.625
as soon as you return

38:34.709 --> 38:36.625
the criminal.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.792
Commander, we will leave.

38:38.834 --> 38:40.709
It is not our policy

38:38.834 --> 38:40.709
to intervene

38:40.750 --> 38:42.834
in the affairs

38:40.750 --> 38:42.834
of other cultures.

38:42.875 --> 38:46.291
But before I return

38:42.875 --> 38:46.291
the survivor to you,

38:46.333 --> 38:49.500
I would appreciate a more

38:46.333 --> 38:49.500
detailed explanation

38:49.542 --> 38:52.083
of what he has done

38:49.542 --> 38:52.083
to merit a death sentence.

38:52.125 --> 38:55.208
As I said,

38:52.125 --> 38:55.208
it is not your concern.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.500
Agreed. However,

38:55.250 --> 38:57.500
there are circumstances

38:57.542 --> 38:59.667
of which you may be unaware.

38:59.709 --> 39:02.333
The survivor has

38:59.709 --> 39:02.333
suffered a memory loss.

39:02.375 --> 39:04.083
He's therefore ill-equipped

39:02.375 --> 39:04.083
to defend himself

39:04.125 --> 39:05.542
against your accusations.

39:05.583 --> 39:08.792
There<i> is</i> no defense.

39:05.583 --> 39:08.792
Our judgment is final.

39:08.834 --> 39:10.333
There's something else.

39:10.375 --> 39:14.250
Since his recovery, he's

39:10.375 --> 39:14.250
manifested unusual abilities.

39:15.250 --> 39:16.667
What kind of abilities?

39:16.709 --> 39:19.542
He apparently has the power

39:16.709 --> 39:19.542
to heal injuries

39:19.583 --> 39:20.917
with a simple touch.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.083
Lies.

39:22.125 --> 39:25.125
And even to reverse

39:22.125 --> 39:25.125
death itself.

39:25.166 --> 39:27.875
Obviously,

39:25.166 --> 39:27.875
he has corrupted you as well.

39:27.917 --> 39:29.834
I see I'm wasting my time.

39:31.875 --> 39:33.917
(<i> gasping</i> )

39:39.208 --> 39:42.500
(<i> all gasping</i> )

39:48.542 --> 39:50.750
I can't breathe.

39:55.583 --> 39:58.291
(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

40:03.458 --> 40:05.917
It's come back to me, Beverly.

40:07.542 --> 40:11.333
I know who I am...

40:11.375 --> 40:13.333
what I am.

40:48.125 --> 40:49.875
Ready all weapons.

40:52.709 --> 40:55.500
You will no longer harm

40:52.709 --> 40:55.500
these people, Sunad.

40:55.542 --> 40:57.750
Fire upon that ship.

41:01.750 --> 41:04.375
Do not be afraid.

41:04.417 --> 41:06.625
I won't hurt you.

41:06.667 --> 41:09.834
Kill him, Captain.

41:06.667 --> 41:09.834
He's evil.

41:09.875 --> 41:12.500
You could learn

41:09.875 --> 41:12.500
from these people, Sunad.

41:12.542 --> 41:13.792
They do not fear me.

41:13.834 --> 41:15.834
They don't know how

41:13.834 --> 41:15.834
dangerous you are--

41:15.875 --> 41:17.917
you and the others

41:15.875 --> 41:17.917
like you.

41:17.959 --> 41:19.583
That is what you and

41:17.959 --> 41:19.583
the other leaders

41:19.625 --> 41:21.417
have maintained

41:19.625 --> 41:21.417
for generations,

41:21.458 --> 41:24.750
but it is not true.

41:24.792 --> 41:25.875
Captain,

41:25.917 --> 41:27.375
my species

41:25.917 --> 41:27.375
is on the verge

41:27.417 --> 41:29.333
of a wondrous

41:27.417 --> 41:29.333
evolutionary change--

41:29.375 --> 41:32.667
a transmutation beyond

41:29.375 --> 41:32.667
our physical being.

41:34.333 --> 41:37.625
I am the first of my kind

41:34.333 --> 41:37.625
to approach this metamorphosis.

41:39.625 --> 41:41.625
They tried to

41:39.625 --> 41:41.625
convince us it was a sickness

41:41.667 --> 41:43.709
we would never survive,

41:41.667 --> 41:43.709
that the pain

41:43.750 --> 41:46.417
and energy pulses

41:43.750 --> 41:46.417
would kill us.

41:46.458 --> 41:49.709
They claimed we were dangerous,

41:46.458 --> 41:49.709
so they destroyed anyone

41:49.750 --> 41:52.000
who exhibited the signs

41:49.750 --> 41:52.000
of the transfiguration.

41:52.041 --> 41:54.417
We were protecting our society.

41:54.458 --> 41:56.458
By murdering us?

41:56.500 --> 41:58.959
You saw the mutations

41:56.500 --> 41:58.959
as a threat to your authority.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
You were terrified of something

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
you couldn't understand.

42:02.041 --> 42:04.917
Some suspected that what

42:02.041 --> 42:04.917
was happening to them

42:04.959 --> 42:07.000
was not evil.

42:07.041 --> 42:09.500
Four of us decided

42:07.041 --> 42:09.500
to flee Zalkon

42:09.542 --> 42:13.291
and let the metamorphosis

42:09.542 --> 42:13.291
take its course.

42:13.333 --> 42:15.125
You hunted us down,

42:15.166 --> 42:20.000
killed the others,

42:15.166 --> 42:20.000
but I survived...

42:20.041 --> 42:23.875
with the help

42:20.041 --> 42:23.875
of a kind...

42:23.917 --> 42:26.125
and generous people.

42:44.375 --> 42:46.875
(<i> voice resonating</i> ):

42:44.375 --> 42:46.875
There is nothing to fear.

42:46.917 --> 42:50.458
You can join me.

42:46.917 --> 42:50.458
All Zalkonians can.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.041
Let me show you.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.041
Don't touch me!

42:53.083 --> 42:55.583
As you wish.

42:53.083 --> 42:55.583
But others will listen,

42:55.625 --> 42:57.208
now that you can no longer

42:55.625 --> 42:57.208
prevent me

42:57.250 --> 42:58.917
from telling

42:57.250 --> 42:58.917
them the truth.

42:58.959 --> 43:02.375
Those who are willing

42:58.959 --> 43:02.375
will follow me.

43:08.458 --> 43:12.333
Sunad is back aboard

43:08.458 --> 43:12.333
the Zalkonian vessel, Captain.

43:26.125 --> 43:28.792
My people are about to

43:26.125 --> 43:28.792
embark on a new realm--

43:28.834 --> 43:31.875
a new plane of existence,

43:28.834 --> 43:31.875
thanks to you.

43:31.917 --> 43:35.375
It is our mission

43:31.917 --> 43:35.375
to seek out life in all forms.

43:35.417 --> 43:37.083
We are privileged

43:35.417 --> 43:37.083
to have been present

43:37.125 --> 43:39.333
at the emergence

43:37.125 --> 43:39.333
of a new species.

43:41.125 --> 43:43.750
Beverly,

43:41.125 --> 43:43.750
you gave me life,

43:43.792 --> 43:46.625
and more.

43:46.667 --> 43:50.709
I do not have the words

43:46.667 --> 43:50.709
for my gratitude...

43:50.750 --> 43:54.333
nor my sorrow at leaving you.
