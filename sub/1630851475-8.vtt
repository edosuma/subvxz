WEBVTT

00:13.847 --> 00:16.182
Hey! Sorry you had to wait so long.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.893
I was second scalpel
on a snoozer hip arthroplasty

00:18.977 --> 00:21.271
when a Bovie submarined
the lateral circumflex.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.689
It was a sponge party.

00:23.648 --> 00:24.733
Sorry.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.317
Surgical jargon.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.569
Gotcha. No worries!

00:27.652 --> 00:28.653
Well, I mean, while I waited,

00:28.737 --> 00:30.739
I nailed a double fakie hardflip
into a frontside overcrook,

00:30.822 --> 00:33.825
and then I combo'd a reverse gingersnap
into an old-school ho-ho.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.326
And I was like, what?

00:36.202 --> 00:37.662
-Skating jargon.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.456
And really, I don't mind waiting.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.207
You know I'd wait all day for you.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.251
Thanks.

00:43.334 --> 00:47.005
It'd be cool to do normal stuff,
like, meet my skate crew Saturday?

00:48.590 --> 00:50.050
But I get it. You're a doctor.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.093
You got weird hours
and you're just doing your job.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.928
Like Big Mo.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.514
Dude won't let me in to use the bathroom
unless I snap my ankle.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.350
It's fine! Walter's my boyfriend!

01:01.311 --> 01:02.228
All respect, brah!

01:04.397 --> 01:08.818
So, I do have to work on Saturday,
but I'm all yours for the next...

01:09.360 --> 01:10.779
fifty-two minutes?

01:10.862 --> 01:11.946
You wanna go for a walk?

01:12.030 --> 01:13.281
-Feed the feral cats?

01:13.364 --> 01:15.867
Only if we get to invent
elaborate backstories for them.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.244
-Crap!

01:18.328 --> 01:20.288
Code Blue, my patient's flatlining!

01:20.371 --> 01:21.956
-That's jargon for...
-I think I know what that one means.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.208
-Go!
-Okay.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.255
Your THR patient from this morning.
He's 83 years old, yeah?

01:29.339 --> 01:33.593
Eighty-four. Possible post-op DVT
or pulmonary embolus. Or caught a PJI.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.637
-Poor old guy's on his honeymoon.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.601
Oops.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.188
Bonnie, we've got a crowd!

01:48.233 --> 01:49.692
Your pulse oximeter came off.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.903
We all thought you flatlined.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.114
Sorry. We're newlyweds.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.533
We just can't keep our mitts off
of each other!

02:01.621 --> 02:02.747
Gotta say,

02:02.831 --> 02:04.707
not a bad way
to spend the end of your life.

02:42.620 --> 02:46.291
That was like watching Nana
and Pop-Pop get to second base.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.168
Girl, we doc-blocked them!

02:48.251 --> 02:50.628
I think it's so sweet
they found each other.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.630
It's inspiring to know
the candle of love still burns

02:52.714 --> 02:53.840
so close to the end of the wick.

02:53.923 --> 02:54.924
Oh, barf.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.926
I hope Walter and I
are like that when we're 80.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.470
Poor Walter.
He reminds me of my first boyfriend.

03:00.763 --> 03:01.598
Huh?

03:01.681 --> 03:05.143
I mean, Doogie, you're 16.
You're still a keiki.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.021
Trust me, you're gonna meet guys
who are way better fits.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.480
We fit great.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.732
He's my first love.

03:10.815 --> 03:15.612
Ignore that hard-up witch
who's clearly been burnt before

03:15.695 --> 03:17.697
and believe in love, honey.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.073
Like me and Trent.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.117
You know,
we're navigating choppy waters right now,

03:21.201 --> 03:23.661
-but we're destined to be together.
-Hm.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.913
You mean your ex?

03:24.996 --> 03:27.373
In Chicago?
Who just moved in with another man?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.917
I said choppy waters!

03:29.000 --> 03:30.210
Walter and I are great.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.253
I just wish I could see him more.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.505
He asked me to meet his friends
on Saturday,

03:34.589 --> 03:36.591
but that's my regular GI rotation.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.010
Why don't we swap?
You take Monday, I'll take Saturday.

03:39.093 --> 03:39.969
No prob.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.221
Really?

03:41.304 --> 03:42.138
Thanks!

03:42.222 --> 03:45.808
Trent and Todd are apple picking then
and are gonna light up Insta.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.020
Can't watch Trent pick
another man's apples.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.737
How much longer is Dad gonna be?

03:57.820 --> 03:59.697
Eternity?

04:00.615 --> 04:02.951
-Hey, Ono Ken, <i>aloha!</i>
-Hello, brother!

04:03.034 --> 04:04.786
-Guava! <i>A hui hou!</i>
-Hey there, Benny!

04:05.787 --> 04:07.413
How's it, Kamealoha family?

04:07.497 --> 04:09.874
Benny struck gold
at Mama Keona's macadamia stand!

04:09.958 --> 04:11.084
It was...

04:11.167 --> 04:12.001
...nuts!

04:14.921 --> 04:16.130
What's this noise?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.423
Carob chip brownies!

04:17.507 --> 04:19.425
Mama K gave 'em to me
for only seven bucks each!

04:19.509 --> 04:21.928
You and the farmers' market.

04:22.011 --> 04:25.431
You always promise to hit it and quit it,
then go in for hours.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.684
It's like <i>Narnia</i>
but with overpriced fig jam.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.895
Oh, come on. It's my chance
to talk story with everyone!

04:30.979 --> 04:34.565
You know, Guava Nohea, Ono Ken,
Smart Ken...

04:34.649 --> 04:36.150
...all the Kens!

04:38.069 --> 04:39.028
Diarrhea mouth!

04:39.112 --> 04:40.154
Garbage.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.574
Oh, my cookie cakes
would dunk all over these fools!

04:43.658 --> 04:47.662
Kai! Dad paid seven bucks
for these poop bricks.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.123
With your oven mitts
and my business savvy,

04:50.206 --> 04:52.750
we could get rich off
of eager suckers like Dad!

04:52.834 --> 04:54.752
Totally! The island's crawling
with chumps!

04:54.836 --> 04:55.795
I'm in.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.171
I could use extra money.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.717
But I don't wanna do any math
or money stuff.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.761
Don't worry, pretty boy.
I'll handle the cash.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.852
The hospital board
wants employee recommendations

05:10.935 --> 05:12.186
for the Chief of Staff search,

05:12.270 --> 05:15.857
which is great for my competition,
Dr. Lee.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.693
The heart surgeon that ranked
everyone's spouse by hotness?

05:19.944 --> 05:23.156
He drives me crazy,
but he can really work a room.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.782
Like Bill Clinton...

05:24.866 --> 05:28.119
if Bill Clinton were half-Malay,
wore cycling shorts to work,

05:28.202 --> 05:31.205
and could recite the entire script
of <i>Cool Runnings</i> from memory.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.624
I love <i>Cool Runnings,</i> John Candy.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.461
I love the hospital!

05:36.544 --> 05:39.839
And I know I can make it
so much better as chief.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.674
But I have to campaign for it?

05:41.758 --> 05:42.884
That's business.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.011
Part of the reason why I left trading.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.472
I do all the crap no one wants to do,

05:47.555 --> 05:50.516
and I'm focused
on actually running the hospital.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.728
But I'm no good at schmoozing.

05:53.811 --> 05:56.898
I'm a workhorse, not a show horse.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.443
Show horses aren't born, they're made.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.613
You have to be a workhorse
at being a show horse!

06:04.655 --> 06:05.573
I have an idea.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.827
You grab some fruit in the market
and lay it out at work with a sign,

06:10.453 --> 06:14.624
"Courtesy of Dr. Hannon.
Your next Chief of Aloha."

06:15.124 --> 06:16.834
That's a great idea.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.753
Then you should sing to them.
From the heart.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.297
But let's start with the fruit first.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.382
Yeah.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.718
You sure you didn't overdo it?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.012
Steph, I wanna make
a good first impression

06:28.096 --> 06:29.430
on Walter's skate crew.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.933
With a shnark-noodle-ree board?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.518
Charcuterie board!

06:33.601 --> 06:36.479
I used meats and cheeses
from six of the seven continents.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.023
It's delicious and conversational.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.904
Whoo!

06:56.999 --> 06:59.877
Why does it smell like a locker room
even though we're outside?

06:59.961 --> 07:00.962
Love it.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.255
Smells like dudes.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.057
-'Sup.
-Hey.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.809
Lahela, Steph, these are my boys!

07:15.143 --> 07:17.019
-This is Spyder.
-How's it?

07:17.103 --> 07:18.312
-Goofy J.
-'Sup.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.314
-And Carl.
-Cool meat.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.527
I'm so happy that you're here. Come on!

07:27.947 --> 07:30.116
GOOFY J.: Hey, look at those handle nerds!

07:30.950 --> 07:32.285
Scoots get the boot!

07:32.368 --> 07:34.370
Hey, no hobbies, lifestyles only!

07:34.620 --> 07:36.706
-They're yelling at children.

07:37.081 --> 07:37.957
Yeah.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.750
Beat it, Fisher-Price!

07:41.377 --> 07:42.336
No, I got ya!

07:42.420 --> 07:43.838
-Yeah, that was good.
-Come on!

07:43.921 --> 07:45.131
GOOFY J.: There you go.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.549
-Welcome to the club.
-GOOFY J.: Yeah

07:46.632 --> 07:48.551
-- Hey.
-- You should come here all the time.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.306
Okay, you left delicious fruit
in the break room...

07:53.389 --> 07:54.515
Now's the time to cash in.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.600
Yeah.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.560
Go get those employee recs.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.981
Oop.

08:02.940 --> 08:03.941
Ahoy, Gail!

08:05.026 --> 08:06.819
All right, that's, um...

08:06.903 --> 08:10.656
So, not sure if you saw,
but I put some treats in the break room.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.283
Yum.

08:12.783 --> 08:13.993
Okay.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.332
-Hey, Joannie! How are ya?
-Good.

08:19.415 --> 08:23.294
You have been a nurse here for,
what, seven years?

08:23.377 --> 08:25.713
Oh, 12. And, actually, it's Jenny.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.341
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry!

08:30.134 --> 08:31.260
Bye.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.014
I need a shave ice.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.474
Make it a double rainbow.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.518
Whoa. What's going on?

08:38.601 --> 08:41.312
My coworkers will never recommend me.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.522
No, they love you!

08:42.605 --> 08:46.275
I just called Jenny,
a longtime nurse here, Joannie!

08:47.235 --> 08:49.987
I mean, wear a name tag on campus,
but still...

08:50.071 --> 08:52.573
Oh, that reminds me,
I gotta get a gift for her baby shower.

08:53.157 --> 08:56.118
She said no gifts but come on,
I'm not an animal.

08:56.202 --> 09:00.206
You were invited to her baby shower...
and I wasn't?

09:01.832 --> 09:03.960
I'm so bad at this.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.421
And now it's gonna cost me Chief of Staff.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.592
-Hey!
-Oh!

09:11.676 --> 09:14.679
Hey, PS, your wife's still number one
on the list, bruh.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.892
Oh, hail Gail!

09:19.976 --> 09:21.644
I'm following your account on Insta.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.689
Dear Tabby? Yes, love it! Love it.

09:24.772 --> 09:28.359
Oh, Jenny! Hope people don't think
the baby's mine!

09:29.610 --> 09:32.488
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Don't call HR.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.701
I'm gonna rec you.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.203
As in "rec"?

09:39.287 --> 09:41.747
Short for recommendations.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.958
Boom!

09:44.041 --> 09:49.130
“Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme!
Get on up, it’s bobsled time!”

09:49.213 --> 09:51.632
-DR.Yeah! Yes!

09:55.052 --> 09:57.513
Dr. Lee is a star.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.724
No wonder Joannie didn't invite me.

10:00.933 --> 10:01.934
Jenny.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.021
You didn't get invited
to Jenny's baby shower.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.607
Right. Jenny.

10:14.947 --> 10:15.990
Hey.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.163
No, like, I can totally,
like, shred the gnar.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.372
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.000
So, like, why do they call you Spyder?

10:26.083 --> 10:29.045
I don't know.
But all the Tarantola men get called it.

10:30.379 --> 10:33.049
Italian! Like-a me-a!

10:34.508 --> 10:36.344
Hey, Lahela.
Thanks for bringing the food plate.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.261
It's cool.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.430
Yeah, Doc. These little pickles are dope!

10:39.513 --> 10:41.307
I feel like a giant man guy!

10:42.558 --> 10:45.770
And I don't know what those
tiny breadsticks are, but they're tasty!

10:45.853 --> 10:46.896
Toothpicks?

10:47.730 --> 10:50.775
Yo, Doc, you ever get to amputate stuff?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.320
Ideally not. But I kinda do it all.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.490
I'm currently
in my gastroenterology rotation,

10:57.573 --> 10:58.949
and it's surprisingly cool.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.201
Gastromony?

11:00.284 --> 11:03.371
Like, butt stuff?

11:03.454 --> 11:05.623
Yo, Doc, you specialize in farts?

11:05.706 --> 11:08.167
I guess you kinda came
to the right place, then.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.046
Okay, let's talk something different.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.635
So, is this what you guys normally do?

11:17.718 --> 11:20.137
Yeah. I mean, if we're not skating,
we're surfing.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.055
Wait.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.183
So you guys, like, never walk?

11:24.266 --> 11:25.810
Walking's for dopes.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.437
The Earth doesn't walk, it spins, man.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.108
Tony Hawk skated
so that we don't have to walk.

11:33.109 --> 11:37.488
Oh, sounds like the Ruth Bader Ginsburg
of transgressional street sports.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.989
I gotta look her up.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.826
Chicks with three names
are always smokin' hot.

11:41.909 --> 11:42.910
I have three names.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.704
So...

11:51.460 --> 11:54.004
Dr. Hannon's bribery guavas have spoiled.

11:55.881 --> 11:59.677
Oh, there she is, lover girl!

11:59.760 --> 12:02.221
So? How was your big Saturday with Walter?

12:02.304 --> 12:04.098
Hm. His buddies were underwhelming.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.934
I finally get why there's no dialogue
in energy drink commercials.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.229
Hm, well, welcome to the world
of mediocre boyfriends.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.523
I mean, if it's not deadbeat pals,

12:12.606 --> 12:17.194
it's unpaid rent, or a wife,
or one time, surprise back hair.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.823
Brillo-back Sammy! I remember him.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.616
-He was funny.

12:24.118 --> 12:28.998
Lahela, you are a gorgeous
16-year-old doctor.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.958
Just gotta keep those eyes open, girl.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.628
Walter and I are great. Great!

12:35.254 --> 12:36.922
I gotta go check on our newlywed.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.966
Oh, you know, I'd knock first.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.136
I think they discovered the handlebars
in the bathroom shower.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.058
Hey, yo! What are you doing?

12:49.518 --> 12:50.478
What?

12:51.145 --> 12:52.229
Sorry about the TV.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.106
I couldn't find the remote.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.524
Why don't you tell me who you are?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.860
Right. Sorry, that was rude. I'm Anthony.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.612
I just started volunteering here.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.572
I read to patients twice a week.

13:02.406 --> 13:03.324
Oh.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.076
Okay. That's cool.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.161
Full disclosure,

13:08.329 --> 13:11.040
it doesn't look too bad
on my college apps, either.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.792
The goal is Columbia for Comp Lit,

13:12.875 --> 13:15.920
and then it's off to Cambridge
for the Ph.D.

13:17.087 --> 13:21.342
Here, if you'd like to indulge
in humanities,

13:21.425 --> 13:23.636
William Carlos Williams
is your on-call poet.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.721
Thanks.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.015
Off to pediatrics!

13:33.938 --> 13:37.107
Chop-chop, partner!
I need 42 cookie cakes by the end of day.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.484
Buddy.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.821
The farmers' market's
not for another couple days. Relax.

13:41.904 --> 13:46.033
Did you not get the business plan
for Brian Patrick and Kai's Cookie Cakes?

13:46.116 --> 13:47.535
I slid it under your door.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.122
Okay, here's the deal with the deal.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.709
We fly high and fast
and force Keebler into a competitive M&amp;A.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.295
Make those smug little elves pay
through the nose.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.964
Build our own tree mansion.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.507
Eh, sounds intense.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.592
I'll fire up a couple cookie cakes,

14:03.676 --> 14:06.971
but I just wanna make enough
to buy myself a pair of kitchen clogs.

14:07.054 --> 14:10.224
But I thought we were doing this together?

14:10.307 --> 14:11.642
Not like this.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.562
I make cookies for fun.
I don't wanna bake for the man.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.021
Don't you get it?

14:16.105 --> 14:17.398
We're the man!

14:17.481 --> 14:19.358
Sorry. Can't do it, bruh.

14:24.738 --> 14:28.367
Then prepare to face
the invisible hand of the market, bruh.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.834
Ah, think next time,
I'll leave it in the box.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.461
At least Jenny won't have
to put it together. Carpal tunnel.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.423
How do you know more
about my colleagues than I do?

14:42.506 --> 14:44.174
'Cause you don't talk story with them.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.343
You come across
as all business all the time.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.345
You're like a mullet
with no party in the back.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.890
I wish I had time for talking,

14:50.973 --> 14:54.059
but with my life,
I have to always be doing.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.645
You should always be being.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.440
Come to the baby shower
and show your coworkers that side of you.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.650
People respond to that energy.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.611
Not only is it how you
should live your life,

15:03.694 --> 15:05.446
but it'll help you get Chief of Staff.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.655
You're right.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.450
I'll go.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.619
Now, this is the sort of event
that has the...

15:11.702 --> 15:13.954
-No booze.
-Yup, that's great.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.040
Awesome.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.878
I refuse to look at pics of Trent
apple-picking with Todd,

15:20.961 --> 15:23.464
but please describe them
and be just to the bitchy side of honest.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.760
Oh, this one looks like
they're in a big fight!

15:28.260 --> 15:31.722
Aw, no wait. They're Lady
and the Tramp-ing a Granny Smith.

15:33.682 --> 15:34.725
Dr. Kamealoha.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.729
So there's this live poetry reading
at the State Library tomorrow,

15:38.812 --> 15:39.647
if you're interested.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.648
Yeah!

15:41.857 --> 15:43.400
I mean, maybe.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.194
Okay, think on it, then.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.239
Oooh.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.324
Doogie!

15:50.407 --> 15:52.201
I think he's into you.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.452
What?

15:53.535 --> 15:54.495
Please.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.538
Girl, come on, she's in love with Walter.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.458
Lahela, do you really see yourself at 30,

15:59.541 --> 16:01.919
listening to Boardshorts Wally yammer on

16:02.002 --> 16:04.755
about how he wants to build a skate ramp
in Auntie's yard?

16:04.838 --> 16:08.133
He's not just a skater surfer dude.
There's more to him than that.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.636
Yes, Walter's like the little black dress
of boyfriends.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.514
He's cute, he is versatile,
and you can take him anywhere!

16:13.597 --> 16:16.850
I mean, he'd say yes to a poetry reading
if you asked, right?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.519
A hundred percent.

16:22.606 --> 16:26.610
Okay, as we buy fruit for the baby shower,
you practice talking story.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.611
Yeah.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.571
Play it nice and cool.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.282
Fanny pack?

16:32.366 --> 16:33.409
I'm good.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.537
Okay. Now remember, the goal today is...

16:36.996 --> 16:39.957
-Always be being.
-Always be being. Got it.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.126
-Let's farm this market.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.212
Cookie cakes!
Come and get your cookie cakes!

16:45.295 --> 16:46.797
-Cookie cakes!
-No, thank you.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.923
Dang it.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.091
Cookie cakes!

16:49.174 --> 16:52.469
-Nice and hot.
-There's a nice vendor I can talk to!

16:52.553 --> 16:55.389
Cookie cakes!
Come and get your cookie cakes!

16:55.472 --> 16:57.558
Ones you grew with your body don't count.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.934
-Oh.
-Good luck, son!

16:59.435 --> 17:01.020
Come and get 'em!

17:01.103 --> 17:03.063
I promise they do not suck!

17:03.647 --> 17:05.024
Cookie cakes!

17:06.150 --> 17:08.110
Trouble moving inventory?

17:13.323 --> 17:15.784
Dude, did you made cookie cakes?

17:16.618 --> 17:18.495
You can barely toast pizza bagels.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.874
I repackaged the brownies from Foodland.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.625
700 percent markup!

17:24.126 --> 17:25.502
Where'd you get the sign?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.380
And why is my name on it? And my face?

17:28.464 --> 17:31.383
Alliteration.
And you're easy on the peepers.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.471
Is that your confirmation suit?

17:35.554 --> 17:37.014
Dress for success!

17:37.431 --> 17:39.141
Paper's my religion now.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.519
Hey, there's still time
to climb aboard the profit train.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.730
Forty-nine percent ownership work?

17:45.314 --> 17:46.231
No.

17:46.774 --> 17:51.779
This place is about supporting farmers and
the sacred rule of one sample per person.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.282
I can't believe I actually wanted
to work with you.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.664
I'm a little nervous.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.416
I'm so bad at small talk.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.878
Relax and focus on eye contact and smiles.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.422
Eyes and teeth. Show horse!

18:15.803 --> 18:16.845
-Hey there!
-Hey!

18:16.929 --> 18:20.182
So, five pounds of mangos, please.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.810
-All right.
-And, um, where are you from?

18:22.893 --> 18:26.230
Oh, you know, originally outside Denver...

18:32.402 --> 18:36.365
Okay, good start with Mango Ken,
but now we add a follow-up question, yeah?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.659
Stay engaged.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.081
<i>Aloha!</i>

18:44.665 --> 18:47.960
Oh, these avocado look amazing!

18:48.043 --> 18:49.920
So, how are things going today?

18:50.712 --> 18:52.422
You always want more people, right?

18:52.506 --> 18:53.757
Oh, not at a hospital.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.760
It usually means a multi-car pileup, so...

18:57.928 --> 19:00.806
Have you ever been in an accident?

19:02.891 --> 19:06.019
And the finishing touch... touch.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.646
Physical contact.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.815
It lets people know you've heard them.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.029
Hit me with seven papayas, my good man!

19:17.573 --> 19:19.408
So, how long you been at this?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.493
Oh, gosh, three years now?

19:21.577 --> 19:24.454
Oh, great! And what did you do before?

19:25.664 --> 19:27.666
I was up in the prison
for stealing a Harley.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.925
Yeah.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.183
Hey! Sorry, you had to wait again.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.143
No worries.
I made some progress with Big Mo!

19:46.226 --> 19:48.270
Turns out, we're both distant relatives
of The Rock.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.521
Oh.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.524
So, I was thinking,
maybe we try something new tomorrow.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.234
Like, a poetry read?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.364
Sorry. I thought you were kidding.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.657
Um, you know, I'd love to,

20:00.741 --> 20:02.451
but Spyder and I are gonna wear GoPros
and skate the dead mall.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.203
You should come!
We're gonna grind down the old...

20:04.286 --> 20:05.204
Seriously?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.999
I mean, is that what you wanna do
with your life?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.794
Uh, I don't know.
I guess I haven't really thought about it.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.630
Yeah, that's the problem.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.425
I didn't realize that there was a problem.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.178
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't plan out
my life at the age of seven,

20:21.261 --> 20:23.096
or however old you were in 11th grade.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.020
Code Blue. I gotta go.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.029
-Okay, baby shower time!

20:39.112 --> 20:40.405
I'll assemble pop-up tents,

20:40.489 --> 20:43.242
you be your amazing self
and win employee recs.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.785
Always be being.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.745
Yeah. You were great
at the farmers' market.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.122
I just hope nine cubic feet
of fruit salad is enough.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.419
Oh, my!

20:54.503 --> 20:57.673
Hi! Benny, Dr. Hannon, welcome!

20:57.756 --> 21:00.801
Hi, Jenny! Where is everyone?

21:00.884 --> 21:03.136
Oh, god, was there a tsunami warning?

21:03.220 --> 21:04.763
Oh, no, no!

21:04.846 --> 21:07.015
Grace and I wanted to keep it small.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.059
Just family, you know?

21:09.142 --> 21:10.310
-Family?
-Family.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.606
Benny's always been so nice to me,
he's practically <i>ohana.</i>

21:15.107 --> 21:16.316
Practically <i>ohana.</i>

21:16.900 --> 21:19.444
Oh, that's so sweet.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.821
Could you just give us one sec?

21:20.904 --> 21:23.365
Just wanna talk for a sec, yeah.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.036
This is like the world's
smallest baby shower!

21:28.120 --> 21:29.538
I kinda hope she goes into labor

21:29.621 --> 21:31.665
because, at least then,
there'd be more people here.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.250
Come on, this'll be fun.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.461
Benny, it's her family and us.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.546
That's a little weird!

21:38.130 --> 21:41.842
See, this is the problem
with your "always be being" mentality.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.052
We end up in these awkward situations.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.847
What's awkward about a baby shower
with just the couple's parents

21:46.930 --> 21:48.348
and the guy they buy shave ice from?

21:48.432 --> 21:50.475
I have so much work to do,

21:50.559 --> 21:52.853
and I wasted all that time
at the farmers' market.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.521
You weren't wasting time!

21:54.604 --> 21:56.857
You were putting out good vibes
so that it comes back to you!

21:58.066 --> 21:59.192
Positive energy?

22:00.527 --> 22:01.945
Okay, I'll try it.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.488
Great, I'll go get the tents.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.365
Okay.

22:09.995 --> 22:13.999
...her barky sinews anchor to soil,

22:14.082 --> 22:17.627
pulling down, down, down.

22:18.253 --> 22:22.966
Until... deafening silence.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.349
Hey, thanks for bringing me.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.142
I don't usually do stuff like this.

22:35.437 --> 22:39.149
So, I'm in the middle
of my college application process,

22:39.232 --> 22:40.650
and it's...

22:40.734 --> 22:41.568
…intense.

22:43.111 --> 22:46.948
You know, I was thinking that a letter
from the world's only teen doctor

22:47.032 --> 22:48.700
would really help me get over the top?

22:50.494 --> 22:51.661
Cool.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.790
Here, I already wrote something up.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.667
You're gonna do is sign at the sticky tab.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.212
-...the beginning of a new day...
-Whoa.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.589
I'm not gonna sign
something I haven't read.

23:02.672 --> 23:03.799
Or actually wrote.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.303
What's the big deal?

23:08.595 --> 23:10.514
I mean, in what way am I
not an integral part

23:10.597 --> 23:11.640
of the hospital ecosystem?

23:11.723 --> 23:15.435
-Ice, ice, some ice!

23:15.519 --> 23:16.728
It's the hospital.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.731
There's an emergency with Glenn.
I'm really sorry, I gotta go.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.857
Can you drive me?

23:20.941 --> 23:24.986
Now? Yeah, I would,
but he's my favorite poet.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.279
-So...

23:26.363 --> 23:28.115
Well, I have a patient who needs me.

23:28.782 --> 23:33.495
Rock. Rock... rock!

23:36.248 --> 23:38.667
Every rideshare car
is over 20 minutes away!

23:39.084 --> 23:40.669
God, I hate tourists.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.762
Walking's for dopes...

23:57.269 --> 23:58.979
Ma'am! Ma'am!

23:59.479 --> 24:01.606
I'm commandeering your skates
for a medical emergency.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.066
A life is on the line!

24:08.989 --> 24:10.365
Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.721
Whoa.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.294
The things I do for science.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.767
Hmm. Yum.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.065
Well, these mangos are outstanding.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.776
Oh, thank you!
I got them at the farmers' market.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.736
The guy, Ken?

25:30.278 --> 25:32.155
He grew up in Denver.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.574
-Oh, I love Colorado!
-Oh.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.409
I'm actually a big skier.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.496
That's my go-to fun fact
for Two Truths and a Lie.

25:39.579 --> 25:42.457
-What, skiing? How'd you get into that?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.251
My mom's from the mainland,

25:44.334 --> 25:47.170
and we would always go visit
my grandparents in the Pocono Mountains.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.172
-In Pennsylvania?
-I'm from Philly!

25:49.256 --> 25:50.924
-When someone went missing,

25:51.007 --> 25:53.969
they would always find the body
in Big Pocono State Park!

25:54.052 --> 25:55.303
-It's amazing!
-What?

25:55.387 --> 25:56.972
Small world!

26:00.850 --> 26:02.102
I be being.

26:02.185 --> 26:05.272
I'm sorry. I know we don't get
to talk much at the hospital,

26:05.355 --> 26:08.024
but did Benny say you're going
for Chief of Staff?

26:08.108 --> 26:09.693
Yes, I am. Yeah.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.195
Would it be okay if I recommended
you to the other nurses?

26:12.862 --> 26:15.240
What? Of course!

26:15.323 --> 26:16.783
I would be honored!

26:16.866 --> 26:19.160
Oh, I know you'd be great!

26:19.244 --> 26:22.956
Benny always says how amazing you are
when we talk story.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.084
You know, you're always so busy
at the hospital.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.962
It's really nice to see
this other side of you.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.505
Aw.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.882
It's funny because
this is the only side I see.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.551
And I love it.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.809
Glenn is out of surgery
and doing very well.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.394
Textbook thrombectomy.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.687
Cleared that clot right out.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.355
He'll be up and kissing in no time.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.399
Thank you, doctor.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.404
Good work, Doogie.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.948
I don't actually want
to see them necking again,

26:57.032 --> 26:58.575
but it's comforting to know they can.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.828
So, how'd it go with Anthony?

27:01.911 --> 27:03.705
Terrible.

27:04.247 --> 27:06.625
I mean, he made a library no fun.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.753
Maybe Walter and I
don't share any interests,

27:09.836 --> 27:12.047
but Anthony's only interest is himself.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.049
Excuse me.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.468
Really, dear. Thank you.

27:16.551 --> 27:18.762
-I was so afraid I'd lose him again.
-Again?

27:19.512 --> 27:20.847
Glenn was my first love.

27:20.930 --> 27:24.351
But we went our separate ways,
lived different lives.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.771
We only just recently reconnected online.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.981
Let me guess, on the Facebook?

27:30.065 --> 27:31.191
On Hot2Trot.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.860
It's like Tinder but for seniors.

27:33.943 --> 27:35.278
And way more aggressive.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.531
But thank God we found each other again.

27:38.615 --> 27:41.826
Because there's no one else in the world
I'd rather be with.

27:41.910 --> 27:45.497
And when you find that, you hold on.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.129
I'm both grossed out and wanna cry.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.881
I just...

27:54.964 --> 27:57.133
And she...

27:57.217 --> 27:58.802
I need some air.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.401
Anthony wouldn't even drive me
to the hospital.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.904
But Walter would wait all day...

28:19.197 --> 28:21.324
...just to see me for 15 minutes.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.328
I think I blew it.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.205
I shouldn't have been
so hard on him.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.458
No.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.502
I blew it.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.089
I got in your head.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.716
What?

28:37.799 --> 28:43.054
God, it must be so hard
to be 16 and a doctor.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.515
And you never let on.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.684
And...

28:47.767 --> 28:48.893
Yeah.

28:49.561 --> 28:53.189
I... wanted to be a big sister to you,

28:53.273 --> 28:54.482
-and...

28:54.566 --> 28:57.444
I just ended up dumping
all my love baggage on you.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.195
I'm so sorry.

29:00.029 --> 29:01.448
It's okay.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.577
Isn't that kinda what big sisters
are supposed to do?

29:09.497 --> 29:15.086
Plus, I mean,
if Bonnie found love 65 years later...

29:18.214 --> 29:19.799
...then there's hope for us, too.

29:26.097 --> 29:29.601
Yeah, there's always hope
when it comes to love.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.478
Just ask Walter.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.756
Lahela, I bailed on skating the mall
with Spyder.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.591
I've been texting you all day.

30:01.674 --> 30:04.719
I'm so sorry for lashing out at you.

30:05.512 --> 30:06.846
I just, I didn't know what to say

30:06.930 --> 30:08.223
when you asked
what I wanted do with my life.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.682
No, I'm sorry.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.143
I shouldn't have put that on you.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.563
It's great that you love having fun
with your crew.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.940
That's high school.

30:19.400 --> 30:24.280
It's just hard for me sometimes
because my life's been so different.

30:26.449 --> 30:29.911
Brought a plate of continental cured meats
to a skate park.

30:30.411 --> 30:31.913
That plate was everything!

30:32.580 --> 30:35.124
I mean, you got Goofy J. to eat,
like, ten toothpicks!

30:37.001 --> 30:38.294
I do love how determined you are.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.464
I mean, my dream's being paid to surf.
I don't even know if that's a real thing,

30:41.548 --> 30:44.717
but I love that you care
about what I wanna do with my life.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.679
Because I want to share it with you.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.184
I love you, Lahela.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.856
I love you, too.

31:06.281 --> 31:09.367
Okay, you believe in love.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.368
Say it.

31:11.828 --> 31:12.996
-Fine.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.372
I knew it!

31:14.455 --> 31:16.416
So you think
I should get back together with Trent?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.003
I think we find you a new Trent.

31:25.592 --> 31:26.551
Sorry.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.613
You're not selling
Brian Patrick Presents Kai's Cookie Cakes?

31:46.696 --> 31:49.198
Nah, the vendors weren't very welcoming.

31:49.657 --> 31:52.493
Based on the body part
they spray-painted on my sign.

31:56.372 --> 31:57.206
Here.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.877
We shook hands,
so I owe you 50 percent of all my profits.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.758
Enjoy your clogs. Or clog.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.010
This is only gonna cover one.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.013
Sweet.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.475
You know, you're all right, BP.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.895
A little off, but you're all right.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.072
Wait, Mom, are you going in?

32:30.114 --> 32:32.200
We're going in.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.082
Don't wait up.

32:48.549 --> 32:53.304
As a doctor, you learn all there is
to know about the human body.

32:53.388 --> 32:56.808
How blood flows, how muscles contract,

32:56.891 --> 32:58.935
how the ileocecal valve can fail

32:59.018 --> 33:02.230
and allow colonic reflux
to overwhelm the sphincter.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.652
Sorry, I'm on my GI rotation
and it is fascinating!

33:09.570 --> 33:12.907
But what's harder to figure out
is how two people,

33:12.991 --> 33:18.579
who seemingly have nothing in common,
can fall in love.

33:22.875 --> 33:23.918
But when you're in it,

33:25.253 --> 33:27.839
and you hear those words
for the first time...

33:32.135 --> 33:35.138
…it's the most amazing feeling
in the world.
