WEBVTT

00:04.882 --> 00:05.947
Thank you so much,

00:06.050 --> 00:07.816
and welcome to the third annual

00:07.918 --> 00:11.420
national Small Talk Convention.

00:11.522 --> 00:12.854
How are you?

00:12.956 --> 00:14.189
How are you?

00:14.291 --> 00:16.625
Hi, how are you?

00:16.727 --> 00:18.527
Hi, how are you?

00:18.629 --> 00:20.762
Threyears, I can't believe
it's been that long.

00:20.864 --> 00:25.500
Back then, the weather was
not as warm as it is today.

00:25.602 --> 00:28.470
It's a little warmer.
Kind of warm.

00:32.109 --> 00:34.042
A lot of construction going up.

00:37.648 --> 00:39.214
It's true.

00:39.316 --> 00:40.949
I'd like to bring up
one of the founding members

00:41.051 --> 00:43.218
of the Small Talk organization,

00:43.320 --> 00:44.820
Ms. Erika Kern.

00:47.791 --> 00:49.624
Thank you so much.

00:49.726 --> 00:52.694
Got my hair cut

00:52.796 --> 00:54.196
the other day.
Um...

00:54.298 --> 00:55.797
I went to a new guy,

00:55.899 --> 00:58.567
and, uh, yeah,
he recommended, uh,

00:58.669 --> 00:59.801
a new conditioner,

00:59.903 --> 01:01.303
which I-I think, yeah, it's--

01:01.405 --> 01:03.972
I think it is working better.

01:06.910 --> 01:08.710
We have some great events
coming up.

01:08.812 --> 01:12.514
Um, pointing at someone else's
kid and saying, "Aww!"

01:14.418 --> 01:16.685
Oh, tomorrow morning, uh,
just "nice."

01:16.787 --> 01:18.386
"Nice."

01:18.489 --> 01:19.588
Also, uh, Sunday, uh--

01:19.690 --> 01:20.856
Yeah, hold on just a second.

01:20.924 --> 01:23.258
Hey, uh, is there a Sally here?

01:24.995 --> 01:29.197
Or is-- is this not the Public
Comedy Bits Convention?

01:29.299 --> 01:31.533
No, that's next week.

01:31.635 --> 01:32.567
That is embarrassing.

01:32.669 --> 01:34.069
Okay.

01:34.171 --> 01:38.240
Uh, and, uh, I am backing out
awkwardly.

01:38.342 --> 01:43.211
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

01:43.313 --> 01:45.647
beep, beep, beep.

01:48.452 --> 01:49.885
I like those shoes.
Are those new?

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074

02:32.496 --> 02:33.828
Okay, so-- so this is what
my name would be then.

02:33.931 --> 02:36.064
It would be Fabrizio Stivasen.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.632
- Isn't that a fun game?
- That's a good one.

02:39.369 --> 02:41.169
You guys took car services
here of some kind, right?

02:41.271 --> 02:43.138
- Yeah.
- There's a way

02:43.240 --> 02:45.640
to see your rating
as a passenger.

02:45.742 --> 02:47.142
- Really?
- Drivers rate you,

02:47.244 --> 02:48.476
- just like you rate drivers.
- What?

02:48.579 --> 02:49.811
- They rate you?
- Yes, they all do it.

02:49.913 --> 02:51.413
Open up the app

02:51.515 --> 02:53.915
and then check check--
"Check My Rating."

02:55.085 --> 02:56.518
And mine is...

02:56.620 --> 02:58.153
5.0.

02:58.255 --> 02:59.688
Oh, this is why you wanted
to play the game.

03:01.425 --> 03:02.691
Yeah, I have bragging rights.

03:02.793 --> 03:04.259
Right?
I earned it.

03:04.361 --> 03:05.660
Sure, okay, we get it.

03:05.762 --> 03:06.761
- I'm a good passenger.
- Great job.

03:06.863 --> 03:08.129
4.8.
You both have 4.8.

03:08.232 --> 03:10.198
- I got a 4.6.
- Ohh.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.334
That's okay.
That's fine.

03:12.436 --> 03:14.135
Do you ever argue with
the driver?

03:14.238 --> 03:16.171
Like, what direction to take?

03:16.273 --> 03:18.440
If they're going the wrong way
or something, sure.

03:18.542 --> 03:20.842
Ah.
That's usually what it is.

03:20.944 --> 03:23.278
Like, you have to sort of, like,
play it cool and let them...

03:25.816 --> 03:27.015
5.0.

03:27.117 --> 03:29.117
In your face.
In your face.

03:29.219 --> 03:30.185
It's a 5.0.

03:30.287 --> 03:31.186
Calm down, Amelia.

03:31.288 --> 03:32.187
Act like an adult.

03:32.289 --> 03:34.055
I don't know if a 4.6

03:34.157 --> 03:35.590
should be telling me
how to behave.

03:35.659 --> 03:36.791
I...

03:36.893 --> 03:38.627
It's not a moral barometer.

03:38.729 --> 03:41.363
It is.
It's how you treat other people.

03:41.465 --> 03:42.864
It's very insignificant.

03:42.966 --> 03:44.799
It's very insignificant
and silly,

03:44.901 --> 03:47.669
but, Carrie, we haven't heard
your rating yet.

03:47.771 --> 03:49.204
What, it doesn't matter.
I don't--

03:49.306 --> 03:50.705
Did you check it?
Just go into Settings--

03:50.807 --> 03:51.806
It can't be worse than
a 4.6, right?

03:53.277 --> 03:54.743
Can I get the check?
Yeah, okay, um...

03:54.845 --> 03:57.245
It's not even a big deal.

03:59.116 --> 04:00.382
- 3.1.
- I can't hear you.

04:00.484 --> 04:01.650
- I didn't see it.
- This was a...

04:01.752 --> 04:03.351
It was a 3.1.

04:03.453 --> 04:04.519
I'm sorry, she's all the way
over there

04:04.621 --> 04:05.587
and there's breakfast noise.

04:05.689 --> 04:08.356
It's a 3.1!
Okay?

04:08.458 --> 04:10.892
Are you guys satisfied?

04:10.961 --> 04:13.261
Who cares?
Who cares?

04:15.165 --> 04:16.498
Sorry.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.766
It's...

04:17.868 --> 04:19.034
- Um...
- You're taking off?

04:19.101 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, we're gonna take off.

04:20.103 --> 04:21.269
You guys are leaving?

04:21.370 --> 04:22.671
Yeah, we just--
we gotta take off.

04:22.773 --> 04:23.872
We'll see you Tuesday,
I think, right?

04:23.974 --> 04:26.741
- Yeah, Tuesday.
- Sorry.

04:28.945 --> 04:30.745
3.1.

04:30.847 --> 04:32.914
I didn't even think
they could rate that low.

04:32.983 --> 04:34.849
Could you help me
get my rating up?

04:34.951 --> 04:37.686
'Cause I don't want to be
shunned by my friends.

04:37.788 --> 04:39.354
Okay.
We're gonna t your score up,

04:39.456 --> 04:40.855
but you have to follow my lead.

04:40.957 --> 04:42.691
- Okay.
- The way we're gonna start is,

04:42.793 --> 04:44.125
I'm gonna call this car...

04:44.227 --> 04:45.460
- I'm nervous.
- Don't be nervous.

04:45.562 --> 04:46.594
- Okay.
- We're all paid up.

04:46.697 --> 04:47.796
I think we're ready to go.

04:47.898 --> 04:49.264
Here we are.

04:49.366 --> 04:51.433
- I'm-- I'm sweating.
- You have a 5.0

04:51.535 --> 04:52.701
in the sweat department.

04:52.803 --> 04:53.868
Thanks.

04:53.970 --> 04:55.403
- And here we go.
- Okay.

05:02.813 --> 05:04.312
Larry, thanks for coming in
today.

05:04.414 --> 05:06.781
You know, as people move up
in this company,

05:06.883 --> 05:09.951
we need to teach them
how to let employees go,

05:10.053 --> 05:11.453
how to fire people.

05:11.555 --> 05:13.955
- Am I getting fired?
- No, Larry.

05:14.057 --> 05:16.725
Um, this is a training session
for you.

05:16.827 --> 05:18.493
Oh.
Oh, okay.

05:18.595 --> 05:20.061
All right, great.

05:20.163 --> 05:21.296
So that's why we bring in
a local actor.

05:21.398 --> 05:23.765
- This is a Matthew.
- Hi. Larry.

05:23.867 --> 05:25.066
Larry, hello.

05:25.168 --> 05:27.135
But I'm gonna be
firing Matthew?

05:27.237 --> 05:28.837
Exactly.
And, you know,

05:28.939 --> 05:29.938
to make it easier, why don't
you guys switch places?

05:30.040 --> 05:31.339
Oh, all right.

05:31.441 --> 05:32.340
You know, Matthew is going
to toss out

05:32.442 --> 05:33.808
a few scenarios for you.

05:33.910 --> 05:35.009
He's going to give you
some practice.

05:35.112 --> 05:36.311
I've never done this before.

05:36.413 --> 05:37.579
Take your time.
You'll do great.

05:37.681 --> 05:38.947
All right,
don't feel sorry for me.

05:39.049 --> 05:40.148
- I don't.
- That's the key

05:40.250 --> 05:41.316
- to the whole thing.
- Okay.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.319
There!

05:48.525 --> 05:49.691
Hey, Matthew.

05:49.793 --> 05:51.626
Uh,
thank you for coming in today.

05:51.728 --> 05:54.429
I-I'm sorry,
but there is no longer

05:54.531 --> 05:57.265
a position here for you
at this firm.

05:57.367 --> 05:59.134
You're gonna fire me?

05:59.236 --> 06:00.635
The company is going through
a lot of--

06:00.737 --> 06:02.337
I have three children, buddy.

06:02.439 --> 06:04.639
One's 1.
One's 40.

06:04.741 --> 06:06.274
All right?
You know how much that costs?

06:06.376 --> 06:08.343
- How old are you?
- I got a 40-year-old

06:08.445 --> 06:10.278
who's trying to buy a house,
and you're gonna fire me?

06:10.380 --> 06:14.182
Matthew, there is no longer
a position here at the company,

06:14.284 --> 06:18.186
and so I am terminating
your employment as of now.

06:21.658 --> 06:23.191
Bleedle.
Bleedle.

06:23.293 --> 06:25.160
The Beatles.
The Beatles.

06:29.299 --> 06:31.199
Why am I here?
I've never been upstairs.

06:31.301 --> 06:33.001
Sir.

06:33.103 --> 06:36.805
Uh, I'm usually down
working in-- in-- in the factory.

06:36.907 --> 06:38.206
Matthew, have you been
taking classes?

06:38.308 --> 06:39.507
Private classes,
which is great.

06:39.609 --> 06:40.875
Yeah, it's every effective.

06:40.977 --> 06:42.477
Dude, by the way,
you're doing great.

06:42.579 --> 06:43.511
Thank you.

06:43.613 --> 06:45.313
What's your name again?

06:45.415 --> 06:48.049
- Larry.
- Larry?

06:48.151 --> 06:50.018
You believe in scripture?

06:50.120 --> 06:54.856
Scripture says that God does not
do onto being fired

06:54.958 --> 06:57.158
and the employees of yea.

06:57.260 --> 06:59.194
We have a very generous
severance package,

06:59.296 --> 07:01.429
which should help you
and your Catholic children

07:01.531 --> 07:02.831
with whatever you may need.

07:02.933 --> 07:03.898
You don't want to fire me

07:04.000 --> 07:04.899
because I'm good at math.

07:05.001 --> 07:06.367
I have theorems and...

07:06.470 --> 07:09.003
all kinds of Canadian
math problems.

07:09.105 --> 07:10.738
I think Canadian math is
pretty much the same

07:10.841 --> 07:11.840
as American math.

07:11.942 --> 07:13.274
I'm threatening you, man.

07:13.376 --> 07:14.876
I'm gonna throw a couple knives
at you.

07:14.978 --> 07:16.744
I got 'em right here
underneath the table.

07:16.847 --> 07:18.379
Matthew, there's no longer
a position.

07:18.482 --> 07:20.181
No!

07:20.283 --> 07:23.017
Never!

07:23.119 --> 07:24.686
You signed a contract.

07:24.788 --> 07:26.688
There's just no longer
a position for you here

07:26.790 --> 07:28.223
at the company.

07:28.325 --> 07:30.558
I could-- I could do, like,
web videos.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.727
- Matthew--
- Actually, let-- let him finish.

07:32.863 --> 07:34.028
You can do what kind of videos?

07:34.130 --> 07:35.430
So I could do little shorts.

07:35.532 --> 07:36.898
I could do a little series
of six episodes.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.199
- Okay.
- So my friend has, like,

07:38.301 --> 07:39.701
a little camera
and it does sound too.

07:39.803 --> 07:41.236
So it looks really lo-fi,
you know.

07:41.338 --> 07:42.303
- Like, fast edits.
- Oh, I love that stuff.

07:42.405 --> 07:43.471
You know, cut to the one guy,

07:43.573 --> 07:44.539
and then cut to the two guys,

07:44.641 --> 07:45.940
and then cut to the three guys,

07:46.042 --> 07:47.375
and then just do the joke
at the end.

07:47.477 --> 07:48.810
It kind of looks rough around
the edges,

07:48.912 --> 07:50.311
but, like, that's kind of
the charm of it.

07:50.413 --> 07:52.146
You know, we really need
someone like that.

07:52.249 --> 07:53.915
Nadine, that's--
that's pretty much what I do.

07:54.017 --> 07:55.383
No, but I could do it
on the cheap.

07:55.485 --> 07:56.818
'Cause I got a friend
who could edit it.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.319
So he can do it on the cheap,
though.

07:58.421 --> 07:59.487
And I think I'd like
to give you a raise

07:59.589 --> 08:00.922
if-- if you're able to do that.

08:01.024 --> 08:02.457
So, congratulations.

08:05.161 --> 08:08.229
I'm not-- I'm not sure
what's happening now.

08:08.331 --> 08:10.732
- I just gave him a raise.
- Yeah, you did.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.467
- Yeah.
- I failed.

08:12.569 --> 08:14.402
I know, I wanted to stop you.
It was really tough.

08:14.504 --> 08:16.905
- You're so convincing.
- He's really good.

08:17.007 --> 08:21.077
And I'm such a sucker
for content.

08:21.792 --> 08:22.000
Fred, here he is.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.669
Wait, wait, slow down.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.304
Don't be too enthusiastic,
you know what I mean?

08:25.406 --> 08:26.405
You could be pleasant,
but they're rating you

08:26.507 --> 08:27.406
- as soon they see you.
- Okay.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.740
So make a little smile,

08:28.842 --> 08:29.741
- and let's just go in calmly.
- Okay.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.376
Here we go.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.678
I'm gonna sit in the front.
Do you mind?

08:32.780 --> 08:33.812
- Hey, man. How are you?
- Hey, hey.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.515
Hello.
Hi, wow, what a nice car.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.950
It's so clean.
What's up, man?

08:40.052 --> 08:41.519
How are you? You look good.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.020
You know the destination,

08:43.121 --> 08:44.788
so make your way
any way that you see fit.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.223
Your eyes are on the road.

08:46.325 --> 08:47.725
You're not even using
your GPS, are you?

08:47.827 --> 08:48.993
You're not.
That's fantastic.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.494
Hey, man, you thirsty?

08:50.596 --> 08:51.795
Have a bottle of water here
in my pocket.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.664
That's a gift for you.

08:53.766 --> 08:54.832
See, that's the shirt I was
telling you about, Carrie,

08:54.934 --> 08:56.233
the one I wanted to get

08:56.335 --> 08:57.568
that is, like,
really expensive looking

08:57.670 --> 08:59.236
and makes everyone look
really handsome.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.804
This chair is great.
Where did you get this chair?

09:00.907 --> 09:01.872
Some Russian flags.
Are you from Russia?

09:10.249 --> 09:12.483
That was a great ride.
Thank you so much.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.818
Great work.
Thank you.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.689
All right, so here we go.

09:18.791 --> 09:19.890
Wait for it.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.825
Five stars.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.527
Well, I feel like
I'm ready to do it.

09:23.629 --> 09:24.828
- You're gonna do it?
- Yep.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.931
Here he comes, look.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.065
Filat.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.333
Filat?
No.

09:29.435 --> 09:30.834
That's "Fillip" with an "F."

09:30.937 --> 09:32.403
Oh, okay.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.704
Well, I'll ride in the front
this time.

09:33.806 --> 09:34.905
- You ride in the back.
- No.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.006
You're on your own.

09:36.108 --> 09:37.007
You're gonna do this solo.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.442
I believe in you.

09:38.544 --> 09:39.743
- All right.
- Here's some water.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.278
- The key is to agree.
- Okay.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.613
That's the important part,
okay?

09:42.715 --> 09:43.614
Whatever he says,
go along with it.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.683
Agree.
Thank you.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.451
Hey.

09:47.553 --> 09:50.955
So...
how are you today?

09:51.057 --> 09:53.924
All right.
Can't complain.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.594
Good.
Um...

09:56.696 --> 09:58.028
Smells great in here.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.763
It's kind of a...

09:59.865 --> 10:01.699
like a sweet and sour,
actually.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.367
Yeah, somebody threw up
in the back last night.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.402
I thought I got it all out.
Sorry.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.104
Well, you did.
I mean, you-- you got it out.

10:07.206 --> 10:08.639
I didn't notice it,
personally.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.774
- Oh.
- Um...

10:10.876 --> 10:11.875
Would-- would you like a water?

10:11.978 --> 10:14.712
I-I brought you...
a water.

10:14.814 --> 10:17.581
- You're giving me water?
- Yeah.

10:17.683 --> 10:18.949
You got water right there.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.384
Wow, thanks.
We both have water.

10:24.523 --> 10:26.824
Get the AC up.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.592
I-I just wanted to
let you know

10:28.694 --> 10:32.262
that you could turn the air
conditioning on, if you'd like.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.765
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.468
Wow, most chicks I know
are always cold, you know?

10:37.570 --> 10:40.304
Weaker sex and whatnot.

10:40.406 --> 10:43.073
Remember--
the key is to agree.

10:43.175 --> 10:47.277
Right, I mean, they need
shawls and the heat to be on.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.080
It's-- it's 'cause
they're weaker.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.515
Really?
'Cause I was kind of, like,

10:51.617 --> 10:53.117
half-joking when
I said that, but, uh...

10:53.219 --> 10:54.785
I was not joking.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.487
Hey, I got a joke for you.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.122
What's the difference

10:58.224 --> 11:01.091
between driving over here
and driving in Japan?

11:01.193 --> 11:02.660
- What?
- Well, over here,

11:02.762 --> 11:04.261
you got your wife on
the right-hand side going,

11:04.363 --> 11:06.130
"Wah-wah-blah-blah-blah."

11:06.232 --> 11:08.599
And in Japan, your wife is on
your left-hand side going,

11:08.701 --> 11:10.167
"Wah-wah-blah-blah-blah."

11:12.772 --> 11:14.271
Yes.

11:14.373 --> 11:15.939
What is so funny about that

11:16.042 --> 11:17.474
is that it's true.

11:17.576 --> 11:18.509
Wow, I got to say,

11:18.611 --> 11:21.145
I had you pegged all wrong.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.880
When I saw you get in the car,

11:22.982 --> 11:25.049
I went, "Okay, here's a typical
Portland liberal,

11:25.151 --> 11:26.884
pro-choice feminazi."

11:26.986 --> 11:27.951
But...

11:28.054 --> 11:29.520
You are cool.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.455
I am cool.
I'm none of those things.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.223
Hey, you know, you never told
me where you wanted to go.

11:33.325 --> 11:35.626
Oh, well, that's because
I'm just kind of along

11:35.728 --> 11:37.227
for-- for your ride,
for your day.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.065
- So you just want to hang out?
- Yeah.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.733
- With me?
- Sure.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.168
- Go where I want to go?
- Whatever you want to do.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.203
- I-I'm here for you.
- Okay.

11:46.305 --> 11:47.871
- I'm here for you.
- I was gonna make a stop

11:47.973 --> 11:49.406
at a gun store in a little bit,

11:49.508 --> 11:51.141
because I haven't been there
in a while,

11:51.243 --> 11:52.676
but, I mean, you don't want
to do that, do you?

11:52.778 --> 11:55.579
You love guns.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.082
I love guns.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.684
- I love guns.
- So you want to come with me?

12:00.786 --> 12:02.086
Sure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.887
- I totally do.
- Wow.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.856
You're the best.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.224
Just kidding.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.259
Of course it would
not be loaded.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.234
<i>Breathe, honey.</i>

12:17.336 --> 12:19.036
Okay, so,

12:19.138 --> 12:22.005
I'm ask you to scoot down
a little bit.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.774
Get me a doctor, please,
and small gloves.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.709
Okay.

12:25.811 --> 12:28.178
Knock, knock.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.880
- Hi!
- Yvonne. We spoke on the phone.

12:29.982 --> 12:31.749
Yeah, thanks for coming.

12:31.851 --> 12:32.750
Hey, I'm Clem.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.385
- Excuse me, but...
- You look beautiful.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.720
Hi, I'm Yvonne.

12:36.822 --> 12:37.955
Hey, this is Paul.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.089
It's okay.
We hired them

12:39.191 --> 12:40.090
to photograph the birth.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.125
Yeah, we paid for this.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.292
We just want it documented.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.427
Hi, hi.
Nice to meet you.

12:43.529 --> 12:44.628
Big day.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.029
- Big day.
- Okay.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.564
- You look great.
- Your ad says

12:47.666 --> 12:49.800
- that you're discrete.
- Absolutely.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.535
We had some ideas
for some of the pictures.

12:51.637 --> 12:53.470
- We've got...
- Okay, oh.

12:53.572 --> 12:56.039
- Beautiful.
- Film noir kind of thing.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.808
- I mean...
- Do you like that, sweetie?

12:57.910 --> 12:59.877
This is, uh, in case you guys
want to have a little fun.

12:59.979 --> 13:00.878
<i>Oh, I love this one.</i>

13:02.381 --> 13:04.214
I think just some candid shots
would be great.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.415
Will you just stand
by the monitor?

13:05.518 --> 13:06.784
That's great.
I love that.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.452
<i>Oh, I love that.</i>

13:08.554 --> 13:09.787
You have great bone structure.

13:09.889 --> 13:10.988
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.757
Okay...

13:15.361 --> 13:16.293
This side down.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.427
Put it right under her...

13:17.530 --> 13:18.829
This is great.
This is great.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.064
This is money.
This is money.

13:22.401 --> 13:23.967
Just-- stop it!

13:24.069 --> 13:26.270
Listen to me,
I love that.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.571
Let me just get some props
here.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.144
I love this.
I love this.

13:34.246 --> 13:35.145
<i>This is great.</i>

13:36.382 --> 13:37.848
Do you like the film noir?

13:37.950 --> 13:39.249
<i>♪ I can do this
all night long ♪</i>

13:39.351 --> 13:40.951
Eight... nine...

13:41.053 --> 13:42.686
Keep it--
keep your mouth shut there.

13:45.691 --> 13:48.158
Stop that!

13:49.428 --> 13:51.795
This is great.
This is great.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.865
It's a girl!

13:54.967 --> 13:58.936
- It's a girl!
- It's a baby girl.

13:59.038 --> 14:01.772
- All right, I'm back.
- Where is it?

14:01.874 --> 14:04.041
- She's right over there.
- No, no, no, wait.

14:04.143 --> 14:06.009
- I'm sorry.
- We missed the whole thing.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.611
You have to put it back in.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.179
Can you put the feet back in?

14:09.281 --> 14:10.581
Just a little bit of it.
Just the feet.

14:20.965 --> 14:22.198
- Hello?
- Hello, yes.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.000
This is Caleb from Synth Card.

14:24.102 --> 14:25.601
<i>Are you the current
account holder</i>

14:25.703 --> 14:28.604
<i>of a Fortune-preferred card
ending in 6099?</i>

14:28.706 --> 14:30.206
Yeah, that's me.

14:30.308 --> 14:32.208
Ms. Paulson, our
fraud detection was triggered

14:32.310 --> 14:33.843
by a recent purchase.

14:33.945 --> 14:35.177
<i>Bridal veil is, uh,
inconsistent</i>

14:35.280 --> 14:37.113
<i>with your purchase history.</i>

14:37.215 --> 14:38.914
I mean, 'cause we don't have
any previous charges

14:39.017 --> 14:40.850
in your account to indicate
any kind of engagement

14:40.952 --> 14:42.918
or long-term relationships.

14:42.987 --> 14:44.854
I am someone that dates.

14:44.956 --> 14:45.855
Look at this.
Meal, one.

14:45.957 --> 14:47.723
Meal, one.
Meal, one.

14:47.825 --> 14:49.425
- It doesn't--
- <i>Drinks, one.</i>

14:49.527 --> 14:50.760
<i>Drinks, one.</i>

14:50.862 --> 14:51.761
There's a meal with
mashed potatoes

14:51.863 --> 14:53.095
and chopped chicken.

14:53.197 --> 14:54.363
What's chopped chicken?

14:54.465 --> 14:55.531
Chicken.

14:55.633 --> 14:56.732
According to our system,

14:56.834 --> 14:57.733
you aren't the type of person

14:57.835 --> 14:59.535
to buy a bridal veil.

14:59.637 --> 15:00.870
Well, I am buying
a bridal veil.

15:00.972 --> 15:02.104
- Oh, you are?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

15:02.206 --> 15:03.606
Our apologies.

15:03.708 --> 15:05.541
<i>Congratulations
on getting married.</i>

15:05.643 --> 15:08.577
I actually-- thanks, but
I'm just the maid of honor.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.113
You're just the maid of honor?

15:11.215 --> 15:13.916
You know, you're the maid
of <i> honor.</i>

15:14.018 --> 15:15.651
<i>That's tremendous.</i>

15:15.753 --> 15:17.553
<i>Look how much you're spending
on things.</i>

15:17.655 --> 15:19.055
Yeah, I kind of didn't realize
it would be this much work.

15:19.157 --> 15:20.222
Yeah, well, you know what,

15:20.325 --> 15:21.924
you're gonna look great,

15:22.026 --> 15:23.426
<i>'cause of the elliptical
you bought.</i>

15:23.528 --> 15:24.660
<i>Get on there about 20 minutes
a day,</i>

15:24.762 --> 15:26.062
<i>and you're gonna do just fine.</i>

15:29.667 --> 15:31.567
- Hello?
- <i>Sandra Paulson.</i>

15:31.669 --> 15:33.602
We're like to verify
your most recent purchase.

15:33.705 --> 15:36.072
<i>Well, yeah, I just bought
a new glue gun,</i>

15:36.174 --> 15:37.173
but that shouldn't trigger
anything,

15:37.275 --> 15:39.442
'cause I do crafts all the time.

15:39.544 --> 15:41.610
I'm a premium Etsy member.

15:41.713 --> 15:44.580
Yes, but this glue gun
is industrial grade.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.082
<i>I would suggest you return it.</i>

15:46.184 --> 15:48.617
The other ones do exactly
the same thing.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.453
<i>You're just paying for the box.
There's no reason.</i>

15:50.555 --> 15:53.122
Well, thank you
for saving my life.

15:59.530 --> 16:01.030
<i>Hey, I've got a question
for you.</i>

16:01.132 --> 16:02.765
I'm seeing here that you bought
a book yesterday

16:02.867 --> 16:05.501
called "The True Path
to Finding Your Soul Mate."

16:05.603 --> 16:07.770
You know, a friend of mine
told me I had to buy that.

16:07.872 --> 16:09.839
It's this friends who's been
single, like, the whole time

16:09.941 --> 16:11.507
I've known her.

16:11.609 --> 16:13.876
Well, maybe no more listening
to her for advice.

16:13.978 --> 16:15.478
- Don't you think?
- Right.

16:15.580 --> 16:17.780
Right.

16:17.882 --> 16:20.049
No, declined, it's--
that is impossible.

16:20.151 --> 16:21.350
Oh, jeez.
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:21.452 --> 16:22.685
Can you hold on a second?

16:22.787 --> 16:24.553
Hello?

16:24.655 --> 16:27.523
You've bought enough stuff
for this wedding, all right?

16:27.625 --> 16:30.793
You cancel that order and
you tell that bridezilla

16:30.895 --> 16:32.695
she can get her own
personalized robes.

16:32.797 --> 16:34.964
You know what?
Caleb, you're right.

16:35.066 --> 16:36.332
You're right.

16:36.434 --> 16:39.602
<i>♪ when you're with me ♪</i>

16:39.670 --> 16:44.340
<i>♪ it's brighter ♪</i>

16:54.752 --> 16:57.653
Yeah?

16:57.755 --> 16:59.488
Don't you dare.

16:59.590 --> 17:01.424
I know.
I know.

17:03.027 --> 17:05.327
Listen, I was thinking of...

17:05.430 --> 17:06.829
going out to dinner
tomorrow night

17:06.931 --> 17:11.099
and buying, like,
an $800 bottle of wine.

17:12.637 --> 17:14.869
So, I guess
you'll have to join me.

17:14.972 --> 17:16.771
Oh, well...

17:19.710 --> 17:21.544
<i>You know I'll be there, Sandy.</i>

17:25.616 --> 17:28.017
I'm, um, I'm really glad
we did this.

17:28.118 --> 17:30.619
<i>Me too.
That was a lot of fun.</i>

17:32.356 --> 17:34.023
- Uh, I'd love--
- <i>Oh, Sandra, you know what,</i>

17:34.125 --> 17:35.691
<i>my shift is ending.</i>

17:35.793 --> 17:36.926
<i>I'm gonna turn you over
to my associate.</i>

17:37.028 --> 17:38.060
Wait. What?

17:40.298 --> 17:43.866
<i>Hello, this is Ricardo
from Synth Card.</i>

17:43.968 --> 17:45.534
<i>What's happening?
Am I having dinner?</i>

17:53.334 --> 17:54.900
Wow, you got your handy lever
action right here.

17:55.002 --> 17:56.135
Look at that scope.
Take a look at that.

17:56.237 --> 17:57.636
- All right?
- Wow, what a scope.

17:57.738 --> 17:58.804
- Isn't that nice?
- Yeah.

17:58.906 --> 18:00.406
- Yeah.
- Oh, my goodness.

18:00.508 --> 18:01.774
Right.
Doesn't that feel good?

18:01.876 --> 18:03.375
- So good.
- How good does this feel

18:03.477 --> 18:05.244
right now?
You can get a bird.

18:05.346 --> 18:06.545
You can get a deer.

18:06.647 --> 18:07.546
You can get a rabbit.

18:07.648 --> 18:09.114
You can, you know...

18:09.216 --> 18:10.816
Uh, I've never felt closer
to anyone.

18:10.918 --> 18:13.085
Carrie, I got your text.
What's happening?

18:13.187 --> 18:15.621
You told me to agree
with everything the driver said,

18:15.723 --> 18:18.057
and I did, and he said
he wanted to go buy a gun.

18:18.159 --> 18:20.059
Let's just get out of here.
Okay?

18:20.161 --> 18:22.494
But I am so close to getting
that 5-star passenger rating.

18:22.596 --> 18:24.396
So just stick with me here.

18:24.498 --> 18:25.764
Okay, hurry up.

18:25.866 --> 18:26.832
This place makes me
very nervous.

18:26.934 --> 18:28.400
I know.
I'm sorry.

18:28.502 --> 18:31.170
So what's your, uh--
what's your favorite gun?

18:31.272 --> 18:32.905
My favorite?
I don't know.

18:33.007 --> 18:34.239
I mean, how do you choose?

18:34.341 --> 18:35.240
- There's so many.
- Right.

18:35.342 --> 18:36.408
I know, there are so many.

18:36.510 --> 18:37.943
Right, Fred?
You know, yeah.

18:38.045 --> 18:39.511
- That's right.
- Hey, how are you, buddy?

18:39.613 --> 18:40.946
How are you? I'm Fred.
How you doing?

18:41.048 --> 18:41.947
Yeah, this your--
this your gal here?

18:42.049 --> 18:43.749
- This your fella?
- Yeah.

18:43.851 --> 18:44.750
- You got a good one here.
- You do have a good one, Fred.

18:44.852 --> 18:45.951
- Yeah.
- All right.

18:46.053 --> 18:46.985
So what are we gonna do today?

18:47.088 --> 18:48.454
Are we gonna load you up?

18:48.556 --> 18:50.923
Well, um...

18:51.025 --> 18:52.458
Do you--
do you have squirt guns or...

18:54.361 --> 18:55.627
What did I tell you about her?

18:55.729 --> 18:57.162
- You're right--
- You are funny!

18:57.264 --> 18:59.598
By the way, squirt guns
are not very cool.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.333
You know what,
I-I actually agree,

19:01.435 --> 19:03.102
because I think it really
just kind of normalizes

19:03.204 --> 19:05.637
the behavior of having kids
around guns.

19:05.739 --> 19:06.839
No, no, no.

19:06.941 --> 19:08.841
It makes guns seem like a toy,

19:08.943 --> 19:10.476
and guns are not toys.

19:10.578 --> 19:12.010
What you want to do, you know...

19:12.113 --> 19:14.179
- Whoa.
- This is a Walther PPK.

19:14.281 --> 19:15.781
Now, you want to wait till
they're a little bit older,

19:15.883 --> 19:17.316
want to just be casual with it

19:17.418 --> 19:18.484
so that they see that it's--

19:18.586 --> 19:19.485
Every time you point it to me,

19:19.587 --> 19:20.986
I want to put my hands up.

19:21.088 --> 19:22.488
- Oh.
- It's the strangest thing.

19:22.590 --> 19:23.989
Immediately.
I don't know what it is.

19:24.091 --> 19:25.290
All right.
Let's get you loaded up.

19:25.392 --> 19:26.291
Okay.

19:34.835 --> 19:36.135
So heavy.

19:36.237 --> 19:37.369
Whoa.

19:37.471 --> 19:39.071
I...

19:39.173 --> 19:40.739
I'm just gonna go look
at these.

19:40.841 --> 19:42.674
The rifles and stuff.
Thank you.

19:45.746 --> 19:46.879
Five stars.

19:48.015 --> 19:49.648
All right.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.049
Wow.

19:51.152 --> 19:52.985
Hey, I got to tell you
something, Carrie.

19:53.087 --> 19:54.853
You are the best passenger
I've ever had,

19:54.955 --> 19:56.355
hands down.

19:56.457 --> 19:57.389
I didn't know it could be
like this.

19:57.491 --> 19:59.191
Thank you so much.

19:59.293 --> 20:00.425
I mean, Fillip, I had a great
day and a great ride.

20:00.528 --> 20:02.494
Five stars for five stars,
right?

20:02.596 --> 20:04.229
Did you just call me Fillip?

20:04.331 --> 20:06.832
Well, yeah, yeah.
It's Fillip with an "F," right?

20:06.934 --> 20:09.501
No.
It's Filat.

20:09.603 --> 20:11.703
Filat.

20:11.805 --> 20:13.505
Wow, I thought we were friends.

20:13.607 --> 20:15.874
But, no, you're just like
every other woman I know:

20:15.976 --> 20:19.011
cunning, deceitful, and
unable to pronounce my name!

20:19.113 --> 20:20.779
But you're still gonna give me
five stars, right?

20:20.881 --> 20:22.281
Five stars my ass!

20:22.349 --> 20:25.551
I went to a gun store
with you!

20:25.653 --> 20:27.219
I told you his name was Filat.

20:27.321 --> 20:29.121
- Oh, Filat.
- Fred--

20:29.223 --> 20:30.789
now I'm a 1.3.

20:30.891 --> 20:32.791
- I'm a 1.3!
- Oh, no.

20:43.737 --> 20:46.738
<i>♪ that's how you die
a lonely man ♪</i>

20:49.810 --> 20:51.410
I'm from the Napa area.

20:51.512 --> 20:52.578
Beautiful country up here,

20:52.680 --> 20:55.581
up by the rolling hills.

20:55.683 --> 20:56.848
Gorgeous.

20:56.917 --> 21:00.152
You should see it sometime.

21:00.254 --> 21:02.160
The colors.

21:03.645 --> 21:05.113
Nice drive.
