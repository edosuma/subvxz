I have to pick up my daughter.

00:10.872 --> 00:12.040
He's never calling again.

00:12.065 --> 00:13.678
He also said he was going out of town.

00:13.678 --> 00:15.145
Yeah, he's never calling again.

00:15.179 --> 00:16.608
I'm the one who turned you in, Karen.

00:16.633 --> 00:19.215
For months, I have been
sitting here supporting you.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.550
Jacob, I'm so sorry!

00:20.584 --> 00:23.453
I choose you, Savi. You're my love.

00:23.487 --> 00:25.488
You feel so right to me.

00:27.590 --> 00:30.288
I prefer you sell this
house as quickly as possible

00:30.288 --> 00:32.704
- for as much money as you can.

actually feeling the wood?

01:11.902 --> 01:14.036
I mean, seriously. Who feels wood?

01:14.071 --> 01:15.404
People who come to an open house.

01:16.238 --> 01:17.239
I guess. It's just...

01:17.273 --> 01:20.575
It's so weird having everyone
touch my things, you know?

01:20.609 --> 01:24.102
And be so judgmental of my home.

01:24.188 --> 01:27.023
Maybe so, but on the plus
side, it went really well.

01:27.148 --> 01:28.348
I'd be surprised if we didn't

- miss the open house?
- It ended about 30 minutes ago,

appointment to come see it.

02:10.566 --> 02:12.971
multiple offers are a real possibility.

02:13.065 --> 02:15.366
You should let Harry know
this could be happening soon.

02:15.487 --> 02:17.522
Mm, that might be kind of difficult,

02:17.547 --> 02:20.216
considering that he is
still not speaking with me.

02:20.376 --> 02:22.577
Do you think maybe you
could fill him in for me?

Listing it in the school party book

- The theme?
- You know, theme.

03:44.237 --> 03:46.706
The hook. What makes it crazy and special.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.475
Last year, someone actually
had the USC marching band.

03:50.201 --> 03:53.713
Oh, no marching bands for me.

03:53.747 --> 03:55.871

back down in that chair.

04:27.140 --> 04:28.531
that reported you to the psych ward

04:28.556 --> 04:29.891
to get your license suspended?

04:29.949 --> 04:31.143
That's the one.

04:31.177 --> 04:32.820
Okay. Why are you having coffee with him?

04:33.222 --> 04:36.148
He said it was work related,
but he was kind of vague.

04:36.182 --> 04:38.348
Hey, do you think that maybe
he found out that you have

04:38.373 --> 04:40.875
a private practice and he's trying
to get your suspension extended?

04:40.900 --> 04:42.587
I hadn't thought of that.

04:42.621 --> 04:44.789
But thank you for putting that in my head.

year? I'm sure it's fine.

not to look at the real-estate website.

05:07.845 --> 05:09.436

over we need to upgrade

it goes on the market.

- No!

the go-between anymore, Harry.

05:29.045 --> 05:30.446
Okay. Joss, look. I know...

05:30.471 --> 05:32.864
- I know that this is awkward for you.
- Just call her!

05:32.889 --> 05:34.419
It will take all of five minutes.

05:34.473 --> 05:36.551
- I-I don't want to call her.
- Fine.

05:36.589 --> 05:38.075
If you can't talk to her, then text her.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.721
That's why texting was invented...
T o avoid any chance of intimacy.

05:40.746 --> 05:42.617
Joss, just one last thing,
okay? And then that's...

05:42.642 --> 05:43.609
that's it. And then you can be done.

05:43.674 --> 05:44.904
Harry, do you understand?

05:44.929 --> 05:46.385
This is exactly why we
can't work together...

05:46.419 --> 05:47.806
This right here. Sorry.

05:47.831 --> 05:49.283
Joss! Joss.

05:52.959 --> 05:54.819
I can't. I can't.

05:57.297 --> 05:58.696
if I could see her, I...

05:59.632 --> 06:01.069
But I just... I cannot, okay?

So, yeah, I'm asking for your help.

So, are you married? Single?

I am married.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.439
I'm actually going through a divorce.

any more money into the house,

Don't inappropriately

I'm sorry. I just... I don't want

07:48.038 --> 07:50.107
there to be a messenger anymore, okay?

07:50.132 --> 07:51.600
I want to talk to Harry

get there. Give him some time.

It's crazy.

08:13.544 --> 08:15.760

- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything is fine.

$1,000 that I don't have

to paint a room that
doesn't need to be painted.

call off the painter?

19:26.073 --> 19:27.706

Well, to be fair, you know, Karen,

19:38.284 --> 19:40.795
you weren't really in the
most "datey" place last year.

19:40.953 --> 19:42.926
When was the last time
you were even on a date?

19:43.026 --> 19:45.275

with a patient or his kid?

it's been way too long.

You have a new place.

I'll make you an online

20:34.567 --> 20:36.489
Oh, God. Did we have a meeting today?

20:36.514 --> 20:39.375
I'm so sorry. I've just been
totally scattered lately.

20:39.409 --> 20:40.899
[Chuckling] No, no. I'm just here

20:40.899 --> 20:42.795

Are you saying that he accepted
an offer without telling me?

20:54.690 --> 20:57.158
I had no idea. I assumed he told you.

20:57.183 --> 20:58.950
Mm, no. He didn't.

20:59.662 --> 21:01.229
I mean, I'm sorry.

21:01.264 --> 21:04.565
But I can't accept any offer on the house.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.669
And until I speak to Harry,

do anything with the house</i>

To save time,

[Chuckles] I definitely don't know.

21:53.238 --> 21:54.538
I guess I've always had

21:54.611 --> 21:56.841
a collector's mentality, you know?

21:56.895 --> 21:58.699
Same thing as when I was
a kid with baseball cards.

21:58.724 --> 22:01.162
You just... you can't stop with one pack.

23:42.364 --> 23:44.665
I'm sure it would be completely different

if we weren't sharing an office.

And you're right. She
has been through a lot.

I wasn't coming in to work yesterday.

40:27.747 --> 40:29.714
But I did let Mitchell's office know, okay?

40:29.739 --> 40:30.797
So don't worry about...

40:30.822 --> 40:33.457
Take a breath, all right?
I-I'm not calling about work.

40:33.501 --> 40:34.634
You weren't?

40:34.808 --> 40:36.168
No. I'm, um,

40:36.660 --> 40:39.761
calling as your boyfriend, you know?

40:39.786 --> 40:41.607
Checking in on my girlfriend.

40:41.774 --> 40:43.376
But I thought you were mad at me.

40:43.533 --> 40:45.210
Yeah, I was. I was. But you know what?

40:45.235 --> 40:47.804
That... that was just me being stupid.

40:48.011 --> 40:49.445
I'm... I'm sorry.

40:49.527 --> 40:52.239
Look, I know you're going
through a lot right now,

40:52.264 --> 40:55.047
and, uh, yeah, I should
be more sensitive to that.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.974
Look. You can always talk to me.

40:58.093 --> 41:00.395
Even if it's about Harry.

41:02.361 --> 41:03.432
I'm sorry, too.

41:03.552 --> 41:06.354
I should have never put you
in that position at work.

41:06.599 --> 41:10.069
From now on, you are only
my boyfriend after hours.

41:10.131 --> 41:11.139
Deal.

41:11.164 --> 41:14.266
And I promise I won't bring
up that Toni stuff anymore.

41:14.291 --> 41:17.167
That's just... me being stupid.

41:17.192 --> 41:18.199
[Sighs]

41:19.911 --> 41:21.746
Um, listen.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.341
I'm gonna work from the
office for a few hours today

41:24.366 --> 41:26.834
'cause it's quiet on the weekend.

41:27.145 --> 41:29.981
But, uh, I can come over
when I'm done if you want.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.756
You know what? I'm still pretty tired.

41:32.790 --> 41:35.556
But can I see how I feel
later and give you a call?

41:35.581 --> 41:36.763
Sure. No problem.

41:36.876 --> 41:38.500
Okay. Bye.

41:39.345 --> 41:40.535
[Telephone beeps]

41:41.772 --> 41:43.067
[Knock on door]

41:51.141 --> 41:53.085
Hi. Can I help you?

41:53.110 --> 41:54.375
Yeah. It's Zack.

41:54.999 --> 41:58.330
We met the other day. I
came for... the open house.

41:58.355 --> 42:00.788
Oh, yeah. Uh, hi.

42:01.260 --> 42:02.894
The house isn't on the market anymore.

42:02.919 --> 42:04.590
I actually accepted an offer.

42:05.889 --> 42:07.486
Oh, that's okay.

42:08.351 --> 42:11.629
Wasn't really interested
in the house anyway.

42:12.437 --> 42:14.699
I just wanted to meet you, Savannah.

42:17.833 --> 42:20.004
We need to talk.
