02:14.340 --> 02:16.741
Alec, how much longer, please?

02:16.743 --> 02:19.611
A couple more hours.

02:19.613 --> 02:22.549
I just didn't remember it was
gonna take this long. I'm sorry.

02:24.651 --> 02:27.018
Are you going
in the right direction?

02:27.020 --> 02:28.686
I know where I'm going.

02:37.731 --> 02:41.399
So when's the next rest stop?

02:41.401 --> 02:43.034
Um, I'm not sure.

02:43.036 --> 02:46.905
They put them every X-amount
of miles that's coming up.

02:46.907 --> 02:49.707
- I really have to pee.
- Want me to pull over?

02:49.709 --> 02:52.443
No. I wanna go to a rest stop.

02:52.445 --> 02:55.580
All right. You're gonna have to
hold it for a little while.

02:55.582 --> 02:57.849
You know I can't do that.

02:57.851 --> 03:00.019
Are you sure?

03:00.021 --> 03:02.089
Yeah, I mean, we'll see.

03:44.999 --> 03:46.467
Hello!

03:47.935 --> 03:49.935
I'm just gonna go
in the back, okay?

03:49.937 --> 03:52.773
All right.
I'll wait for you in the car.

05:24.901 --> 05:29.103
I wish you had came
and seen the tents with me.

05:29.105 --> 05:33.107
I just wanna stay in the car and
try to just like push through.

05:33.109 --> 05:37.244
No. It was like
an abandoned site.

05:37.246 --> 05:40.147
- Tents.
- Just can't wait?

05:40.149 --> 05:42.550
Yeah, people don't just
up and leave their stuff.

05:42.552 --> 05:44.819
They take their belongings
with them, their clothes.

05:44.821 --> 05:46.020
Maybe they were
throwing it away.

05:46.022 --> 05:47.588
Just left it there.

05:47.590 --> 05:49.559
Maybe it was like broken.

05:50.994 --> 05:53.761
Oh, we're getting low on gas.

05:53.763 --> 05:57.198
Got like a little less than
a quarter tank.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.632
We'll stop soon.

05:58.634 --> 06:00.634
Are we coming up
on a gas station soon?

06:00.636 --> 06:02.304
They'll be one soon.

06:02.306 --> 06:05.106
They put them on points
along the road.

06:37.374 --> 06:39.009
Hey!

06:40.610 --> 06:42.077
How's it going?

06:42.079 --> 06:44.646
I don't know.
It just died all of a sudden.

06:44.648 --> 06:46.014
Is it the battery
do you think?

06:46.016 --> 06:48.250
I don't know.
How should I know?

06:48.252 --> 06:50.352
Well, I got jumper cables.
I can try to start it.

06:50.354 --> 06:52.289
Yeah, do that.

06:58.362 --> 07:00.363
So are you from around here?

07:00.365 --> 07:02.866
Yeah.

07:14.145 --> 07:17.047
So where's the ring?

07:18.183 --> 07:19.415
Excuse me?

07:19.417 --> 07:21.716
You know, where's the ring?

07:21.718 --> 07:23.952
He's not your brother, is he?

07:23.954 --> 07:26.289
Um...

07:26.291 --> 07:28.391
That's really
none of your business.

07:28.393 --> 07:32.929
Well, with you standing there,
I'll make it my business.

07:32.931 --> 07:35.431
It's people like you that think
they can have everything

07:35.433 --> 07:38.367
and not take responsibility
for anything.

07:38.369 --> 07:40.970
We're trying to help you.

07:40.972 --> 07:43.806
Help me?
Did I ask for help?

07:44.943 --> 07:48.711
You stopped and...

07:48.713 --> 07:51.848
that no-good boyfriend of yours
or whatever you call him,

07:51.850 --> 07:54.450
he doesn't seem to know
what's he's doing anyhow.

07:54.452 --> 07:57.186
Uh, I'm sorry. I...

07:57.188 --> 07:59.822
I don't know
what the problem is.

07:59.824 --> 08:01.357
See? There you have it.

08:01.359 --> 08:03.995
You think he can
build you a house?

08:05.897 --> 08:08.231
Let's get out of here.

08:08.233 --> 08:09.901
I'm sorry.

08:12.070 --> 08:15.104
Yeah, that's right.
Go ahead and leave!

08:21.846 --> 08:23.215
Don't say it.

08:24.816 --> 08:27.351
Don't say it, okay?

08:27.353 --> 08:29.752
- 'Cause you told me so.
- Mm-hmm.

08:29.754 --> 08:33.256
You know, it's okay.

08:33.259 --> 08:35.825
You just have to learn
from your mistakes.

08:35.827 --> 08:38.028
If you wanna help crabby women
on the side of the road,

08:38.030 --> 08:39.462
go ahead.

08:39.465 --> 08:41.063
I didn't know she was
going to be crabby.

08:41.066 --> 08:43.001
I thought I was being nice.

08:44.169 --> 08:45.769
What?

08:45.771 --> 08:48.071
I could tell,
even from 20 feet away from her,

08:48.073 --> 08:50.741
I could tell she was gonna be
such a jerk to us.

08:50.743 --> 08:53.477
This is why I avoid
the country.

08:53.479 --> 08:56.982
I know.
'Cause they're all like that.

09:00.019 --> 09:01.919
I don't know, man.

09:01.921 --> 09:05.357
She was having a bad day.
Her car pooped out on her.

09:07.826 --> 09:09.293
Still, it doesn't
give her the right

09:09.295 --> 09:11.665
to be rude to people
who are helping.

09:35.555 --> 09:37.357
How's it going?

09:48.068 --> 09:50.168
Well, look at you,
young and tender.

09:51.972 --> 09:53.972
Can I get y'all
something to drink?

09:53.974 --> 09:55.974
Can I have a coffee, please?

09:55.976 --> 09:57.175
Sure.

09:57.177 --> 09:58.243
I'll do water.

09:58.245 --> 10:00.380
- Alrighty.
- Thank you.

10:01.848 --> 10:03.848
You're not eating?

10:03.850 --> 10:06.551
Uh, sure.
What's your special today?

10:06.553 --> 10:09.821
This is a diner.

10:09.823 --> 10:11.155
Have a burger.

10:11.157 --> 10:12.323
Sure.

10:12.325 --> 10:14.259
Can I have it with cheese,
please?

10:14.261 --> 10:17.295
I'll check.
How would you liked that cooked?

10:17.297 --> 10:19.097
- Medium-rare, please.
- All right.

10:19.099 --> 10:20.298
And you?

10:20.300 --> 10:22.434
I will do
the exact same thing.

10:22.436 --> 10:24.436
- You want fries with that?
- That would be awesome.

10:24.438 --> 10:26.871
- Oh, me too.
- All right.

10:26.873 --> 10:27.872
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:27.874 --> 10:29.310
Be right back.

10:30.411 --> 10:32.877
"What special is on today?"

10:32.879 --> 10:35.547
I don't know what to order
when I come to a diner.

10:35.549 --> 10:38.952
Maybe she likes
making something special.

10:43.024 --> 10:45.190
- Oh, thank you.
- And for you, water.

10:45.192 --> 10:46.893
Thank you.

10:49.297 --> 10:50.896
- It's good.
- Hmm?

10:50.898 --> 10:53.265
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I get some?

10:53.267 --> 10:55.503
- Sure.
- Oh, thank you.

10:57.238 --> 10:58.604
Mmm.

10:58.606 --> 11:01.173
Oh, my God,
I should've got a coffee.

11:28.570 --> 11:30.269
- Thank you.
- Cheese.

11:30.271 --> 11:31.404
Thanks.

11:31.406 --> 11:32.539
Thank you.

11:32.541 --> 11:34.108
Enjoy.

11:57.132 --> 11:58.365
Okay?

11:58.367 --> 12:00.202
That guy.

12:04.272 --> 12:06.608
I'm sure he just likes
new people.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.580
Let's go.

12:13.215 --> 12:14.449
Okay.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.420
- I'll get this.
- All right.

12:30.265 --> 12:32.666
You're not safe here.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.336
Hey, what's going on?

12:35.338 --> 12:36.637
Uh, nothing.

12:36.639 --> 12:38.608
- You okay?
- Yeah. Let's go.

13:02.598 --> 13:03.631
You okay?

13:03.633 --> 13:06.100
Yeah, no, I'm great.

13:06.102 --> 13:09.703
What was up with that guy?

13:09.705 --> 13:12.740
No, yeah,
he was just being weird.

13:12.742 --> 13:15.777
Local weirdo, I guess.
I don't know.

13:15.779 --> 13:18.412
I just never, you know...

13:18.414 --> 13:20.715
I don't wanna think about him,
you know what I mean?

13:20.717 --> 13:24.120
No, he's harmless, I'm sure.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.790
All right.

13:28.792 --> 13:31.260
- Just making sure you're okay.
- Yeah.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.354
Man, it feels good to stand.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.730
Do you need any help
with anything?

14:08.732 --> 14:10.367
No, I got it.

14:26.416 --> 14:28.083
Hi.

14:28.085 --> 14:29.386
Hi.

14:54.779 --> 14:57.480
- That'll be $50.
- Cool.

14:57.482 --> 14:59.116
And these, please.

15:00.718 --> 15:03.187
58.40.

15:05.456 --> 15:07.057
Here you go.

15:10.361 --> 15:12.828
Here you go.

15:12.830 --> 15:16.132
You know if there's like
a bed and breakfast around here?

15:16.134 --> 15:17.633
Bed and breakfast?

15:17.635 --> 15:20.836
Yeah, like a hostel or a motel
or something like that?

15:20.838 --> 15:22.638
Oh, yeah,
I know what you mean.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.508
Yeah, there's some cabins
down the road.

15:25.510 --> 15:27.443
On your right side,

15:27.445 --> 15:30.446
this guy rents them
pretty cheap.

15:30.448 --> 15:33.149
Okay, so like up the road
for how long?

15:33.151 --> 15:34.885
Maybe 20 minutes.
You can't miss it.

15:34.887 --> 15:37.621
It's like a few wooden cabins.

15:37.623 --> 15:40.556
Cool. Well, thank you.

15:40.558 --> 15:41.825
It's my pleasure.

15:41.827 --> 15:43.694
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

15:43.696 --> 15:45.864
- Yeah.
- You too.

15:58.544 --> 16:00.444
Ah, this is gonna be good.

16:00.446 --> 16:01.912
I could use some sleep.

16:01.914 --> 16:04.348
Yeah, let's check it out,
see how it looks

16:04.350 --> 16:06.850
and then figure out
what to do from there.

16:06.852 --> 16:09.853
- What do you mean?
- No, you know.

16:09.855 --> 16:14.191
Just make sure it's something
that is not sketchy.

16:14.193 --> 16:15.892
I mean, if there's a cockroach
in the bed,

16:15.894 --> 16:16.960
do you wanna stay there?

16:16.962 --> 16:18.362
I'll flick it out of the bed

16:18.364 --> 16:21.798
and then get in the bed
and go to sleep.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.433
I don't know.
That guy was...

16:23.435 --> 16:25.836
He was a little creepy
and just...

16:25.838 --> 16:27.571
I don't know.
What if he recommended us

16:27.573 --> 16:30.340
to his friend's place,
and he's a creep too?

16:30.342 --> 16:32.342
- What if he did?
- I don't know.

16:32.344 --> 16:35.545
It's just really unsettling.
I'd rather just go.

16:35.547 --> 16:37.280
Let's just go.

16:37.282 --> 16:39.884
Wouldn't it be much nicer
to just stay at home?

16:39.886 --> 16:41.786
Yes, it would be,
but I'm tired,

16:41.788 --> 16:43.988
and I don't want to get us
into an accident, okay?

16:43.990 --> 16:46.958
No, I know.
I know you do.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.660
You're lovely.

16:48.662 --> 16:51.596
I mean, I could fall asleep
at the wheel, you know,

16:51.598 --> 16:53.263
but it seems like
sleeping in a bed

16:53.265 --> 16:55.500
might be the better,
safer option.

16:55.502 --> 16:57.401
- Think so?
- Yeah, I think so.

17:46.453 --> 17:48.754
This place looks creepy.

17:48.756 --> 17:50.455
What do you mean,
it looks creepy?

17:50.457 --> 17:51.890
No, seriously,
I don't want to stay here.

17:51.892 --> 17:53.524
- Are you serious?
- I'm scared.

17:53.526 --> 17:55.894
Look how many cars
are around here. Come on.

17:55.896 --> 17:58.231
Come on, just give it a shot.
Come on.

18:04.805 --> 18:07.740
No, I don't wanna get hacked up
in the middle of the night.

18:07.742 --> 18:10.676
We're not gonna get hacked up.
Look how many cars are here.

18:10.678 --> 18:13.011
None of which are police cars.

18:13.013 --> 18:14.980
Somehow I think we are okay.

18:14.982 --> 18:16.381
You're so reassuring.

18:16.383 --> 18:17.616
Plus, you wanna know something?

18:17.618 --> 18:19.985
- What?
- I'm deadly with a knife.

18:54.790 --> 18:55.891
That's kinda cool.

19:03.799 --> 19:05.397
Come on.

19:15.844 --> 19:16.845
Hello?

19:28.690 --> 19:29.889
Okay, no one's here.

19:29.891 --> 19:31.524
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey.

19:31.526 --> 19:33.593
Hey, hold on, look.

19:33.595 --> 19:36.031
People have been here.
Relax.

19:41.503 --> 19:42.939
Hello!

19:47.742 --> 19:49.578
It's kinda amazing.

19:52.048 --> 19:55.015
No. Nobody's here.
This is...

19:55.017 --> 19:56.616
It's not ideal.

19:56.618 --> 19:58.855
There's plenty of people here.

20:21.477 --> 20:22.879
Hello?

20:25.781 --> 20:27.615
Hey there!

20:27.617 --> 20:29.583
Oh, hey.

20:29.585 --> 20:31.919
Sorry. I didn't hear you guys
come in.

20:31.921 --> 20:33.587
Have you been here long?

20:33.589 --> 20:36.959
No, not that long.
We're fine.

20:38.794 --> 20:40.861
Where you guys from?

20:40.863 --> 20:42.763
Los Angeles.

20:42.765 --> 20:45.466
Hey, I used to live
out there myself.

20:45.468 --> 20:48.502
San Fernando Valley.

20:48.504 --> 20:50.471
So I suppose you two
want a room?

20:50.473 --> 20:53.041
Uh, yeah, that'd be great.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.077
Wonderful.
Just follow me.

20:56.079 --> 20:57.480
Okay.

20:58.982 --> 21:01.515
- Let's go.
- Let's just check it out.

21:01.517 --> 21:03.952
If you don't like it,
we'll go, okay?

21:03.954 --> 21:05.155
You're so...

21:08.792 --> 21:10.761
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

21:21.171 --> 21:24.005
It's beautiful out here.

21:24.007 --> 21:25.943
It sure is.

21:31.882 --> 21:33.183
Here we go.

21:37.821 --> 21:39.890
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

21:44.195 --> 21:46.262
There's a lot of beds here
'cause we used to rent it out

21:46.264 --> 21:51.233
to Boy Scout troops
and church groups that, uh...

21:51.235 --> 21:53.635
They haven't been around here
a lot lately,

21:53.637 --> 21:56.805
so I just kind of made it
into a motel room.

21:56.807 --> 21:57.908
Cool.

21:59.543 --> 22:01.843
Hmm. So have you had
this place long?

22:01.845 --> 22:03.145
Since 1989.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.579
Wow.

22:04.581 --> 22:06.816
I fell in love with it
just driving by.

22:06.818 --> 22:11.020
I was driving, driving,
driving.

22:11.022 --> 22:12.121
Uh-huh.

22:12.123 --> 22:15.557
Driving from everything I knew.

22:15.559 --> 22:18.194
I saw this place,
stopped the car,

22:18.196 --> 22:21.197
walked in and asked
if I could work here.

22:21.199 --> 22:24.166
Repaired the cabin,
fixed things up.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.768
Been here ever since.

22:25.770 --> 22:29.171
Mrs. Anderson
used to run the place.

22:29.173 --> 22:33.642
She passed away
about four years ago now.

22:33.644 --> 22:34.977
Sorry.

22:34.979 --> 22:38.247
So I been running the place
ever since.

22:38.249 --> 22:39.717
Nice.

22:42.354 --> 22:45.788
Uh, so do you get
many people

22:45.790 --> 22:47.723
coming around here
in the summer?

22:47.725 --> 22:52.028
The usual.
Just a steady stream.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.662
Is there good hiking
around here?

22:53.664 --> 22:56.199
Um, I'm sorry.
Could you please excuse us?

22:56.201 --> 22:59.136
It's been a really long day.
We can use some sleep.

22:59.138 --> 23:02.239
Yeah, sure.

23:02.241 --> 23:04.707
Just trying
to make conversation.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.609
- Of course.
- Not a lot of people stop here,

23:06.611 --> 23:09.745
so I like to talk
to the people that do.

23:09.747 --> 23:12.184
I get it.

23:15.054 --> 23:17.020
- Have a good night.
- You too.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.255
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

23:18.257 --> 23:19.958
See you tomorrow.

23:24.296 --> 23:26.830
- A bit rude, wasn't it?
- No, no, no, no.

23:26.832 --> 23:28.999
Shut up. It's fine.
He's weird, okay?

23:29.001 --> 23:32.069
He seems nice. He doesn't have
many people around here.

23:32.071 --> 23:35.005
"Steady stream."
That's what I heard.

23:35.007 --> 23:38.708
So I'm sure he's got plenty
of other people to go talk to.

23:38.710 --> 23:41.311
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to be nice to the guy.

23:41.313 --> 23:43.914
He's just a little too...

23:43.916 --> 23:45.148
repulsive,

23:45.150 --> 23:47.651
just him standing there
talking so much.

23:50.055 --> 23:52.323
Repulsive?

23:52.325 --> 23:54.258
It's unsettling.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.128
Oh, my God.
He's a monster.

24:19.919 --> 24:21.321
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:59.521 --> 26:00.988
Alec!

28:27.604 --> 28:30.472
What is that?

28:30.474 --> 28:32.507
What is that?

28:32.509 --> 28:34.609
No! No!

28:34.611 --> 28:36.211
Hey, I said no!

28:36.213 --> 28:37.679
No! I said no!

28:37.681 --> 28:39.216
Get away!

28:41.017 --> 28:42.018
Get...

28:57.601 --> 29:00.068
You son of a bitch!
Fucking...

29:01.104 --> 29:03.004
What the fuck!

29:03.006 --> 29:05.676
What the fuck did you do?

29:11.381 --> 29:13.549
You stupid bitch!

29:13.551 --> 29:17.018
Fuck! You fucking bitch!

29:23.994 --> 29:25.329
Help!

33:47.662 --> 33:49.595
Help me.

33:49.597 --> 33:51.397
Help.

33:51.399 --> 33:52.732
Hey.

33:52.734 --> 33:53.768
Hey!

33:54.836 --> 33:56.571
Hey!

34:10.885 --> 34:12.885
Hey. Hey!

34:17.025 --> 34:19.027
Hey!

34:55.030 --> 34:56.364
Hey.

41:39.107 --> 41:40.242
Hey, man.

41:41.410 --> 41:44.043
All good?

41:44.045 --> 41:47.481
The food has to be ready to go
in three hours.

41:47.483 --> 41:49.884
We're cooking
for about 80 people.

41:52.188 --> 41:55.823
Are we even gonna have
enough food for tonight?

41:59.428 --> 42:02.162
We really have to be on our toes
with this thing.

42:02.164 --> 42:04.900
Do you think
you can manage that?

42:09.171 --> 42:11.038
Hey, everybody!

42:11.040 --> 42:15.042
The food has to be ready to go
in 2 1/2 hours,

42:15.044 --> 42:17.911
and they've added
an additional 20 portions,

42:17.913 --> 42:21.048
so step it up a notch!

42:21.050 --> 42:23.984
We need 15 pounds of ground beef
for the lasagna.

42:23.986 --> 42:26.386
Do we have that?
We have some here.

42:26.388 --> 42:28.388
It ain't nearly enough.

42:28.390 --> 42:31.959
Looks like we have
everything for the stew.

42:31.961 --> 42:36.464
And please, everybody,
this time use a little finesse.

42:36.466 --> 42:38.067
Thank you!

42:51.314 --> 42:54.047
Hello?

42:54.049 --> 42:56.517
Ah, hello, sir!

42:56.519 --> 42:59.920
Absolutely.

42:59.922 --> 43:03.591
And what time were you
thinking about coming by?

43:03.593 --> 43:05.892
Perfect.

43:05.894 --> 43:08.431
Okay, see you then.

43:10.267 --> 43:11.868
Shit.

43:21.478 --> 43:23.978
Hodder is coming.

43:23.980 --> 43:27.482
I guess we can use a bit of
our diary livestock a bit early.

43:27.484 --> 43:30.420
We really need to come up
with something special.

44:20.905 --> 44:24.640
And we have three more
in the stable?

44:24.642 --> 44:27.178
And only one is ready?

44:29.513 --> 44:30.981
Hmm.

45:38.550 --> 45:40.051
Come on.

45:43.288 --> 45:45.558
You two bring the milk
to the kitchen.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.230
Hey, little girl.

47:32.232 --> 47:34.167
Hey, little girl, what's up?

47:35.402 --> 47:37.237
You hungry?

47:38.639 --> 47:41.606
See? It's not so bad.

47:41.608 --> 47:43.542
You are out
of your fucking mind!

47:43.544 --> 47:45.110
That's mean!

47:45.112 --> 47:47.713
You're sick,
you fucking retard!

47:47.715 --> 47:49.481
Bad human!

47:49.483 --> 47:51.717
See?

47:51.719 --> 47:54.687
It's your own fault.

47:54.689 --> 47:57.657
It's your own fault!

47:57.659 --> 47:59.694
You're all bad!

48:50.345 --> 48:53.880
I'm very sorry
you feel that way.

48:53.882 --> 48:56.819
Of course I did not intend
to ruin your wedding.

48:58.486 --> 49:02.355
A tooth in the food?

49:02.357 --> 49:04.290
That's strange.

49:04.292 --> 49:07.128
I'll make sure to speak
to the chefs about this.

49:11.199 --> 49:12.966
Yes, I understand.

49:12.968 --> 49:15.334
I understand it's too late now,
but I want to make sure

49:15.336 --> 49:17.906
this doesn't happen again
on your next order.

49:19.541 --> 49:22.476
Look, we'll cater
your next event for free

49:22.478 --> 49:24.978
to compensate, okay?

49:24.980 --> 49:27.714
Please just think about it,
okay?

49:27.716 --> 49:29.852
All right, okay, goodbye.

49:44.466 --> 49:47.503
You spoiled a perfectly
healthy woman.

49:49.973 --> 49:52.374
"Andrew."

49:53.742 --> 49:56.911
Can't think,
but he sure can feel.

49:56.913 --> 49:58.311
Go find Andrew.

49:58.313 --> 50:00.482
He must be around here
someplace.

50:21.270 --> 50:22.704
Hey.

50:22.706 --> 50:25.640
Hey.

50:25.642 --> 50:28.576
What the fuck's
going on here?

50:28.578 --> 50:30.311
You don't wanna know.

50:30.313 --> 50:32.346
How do we get out of here?

50:32.348 --> 50:34.484
You don't.

50:42.592 --> 50:46.861
They're spying outside of
that rest stop where you were.

50:46.863 --> 50:49.632
They treat us like milk cows.

50:55.672 --> 50:57.607
How long have you been here?

51:00.077 --> 51:01.778
Two years.

51:06.016 --> 51:10.286
I've had one child
and several miscarriages.

51:12.690 --> 51:14.690
That's insane.

51:14.692 --> 51:17.762
But soon it's gonna be over.

51:20.698 --> 51:22.900
I can't get pregnant anymore.

51:28.906 --> 51:33.642
I'm so glad I get to be
done with this.

51:37.548 --> 51:39.114
Who is that?

51:41.385 --> 51:43.320
That's Ash.

51:45.956 --> 51:48.058
She's been here
about two weeks.

51:49.627 --> 51:50.628
Ashley.

51:52.063 --> 51:53.929
- Yeah?
- We're gonna get out of here.

51:53.931 --> 51:54.997
No, we can't.

51:54.999 --> 51:56.365
We will. I promise.

51:56.367 --> 51:59.336
They'll find us.
They always do.

53:09.641 --> 53:11.543
Don't say that.

53:12.777 --> 53:14.947
It's nicer to play.

53:17.616 --> 53:19.616
But I don't wanna play.

53:19.618 --> 53:21.888
I just wanna eat!

53:24.489 --> 53:26.558
You have to be good!

53:28.060 --> 53:29.795
Eat it.

53:32.565 --> 53:34.166
Good boy.

53:35.234 --> 53:37.536
That's a good boy.

53:43.109 --> 53:46.612
Everybody can now play.

53:47.980 --> 53:50.581
It wasn't my fault!
She was mean!

53:50.583 --> 53:52.716
She asked for my help,

53:52.718 --> 53:55.753
but when I came over,
she wasn't nice!

53:55.755 --> 53:57.922
She yelled at me!

53:57.924 --> 54:01.558
She said I was out of my mind,
but she's wrong!

54:01.560 --> 54:04.495
Sometimes my mind
is out of me!

54:13.739 --> 54:15.907
I'm sorry.

54:15.909 --> 54:17.608
Why aren't you
at the gas station?

54:17.610 --> 54:19.643
I don't know. I just...

54:19.645 --> 54:21.545
Just what?

54:21.547 --> 54:25.984
How many times have I told you
to stop playing with the food?

54:25.986 --> 54:27.718
Now we have to dispose to two,

54:27.720 --> 54:30.922
possibly three
perfectly healthy adults,

54:30.924 --> 54:35.160
one that would've given us milk
for at least a year.

54:35.162 --> 54:37.228
Do you know
how much that costs?

54:37.230 --> 54:39.597
I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

54:39.599 --> 54:40.699
I promise.

54:40.701 --> 54:42.934
Oh, of course you won't.

54:42.936 --> 54:44.736
Take him with you
on your chores today.

54:44.738 --> 54:46.972
Don't let him
out of your sight.

54:46.974 --> 54:50.008
You can start
by feeding these ones.

55:02.622 --> 55:04.155
Mmm!

55:04.157 --> 55:06.093
Something smells good.

57:42.218 --> 57:43.818
And oregano!

57:43.820 --> 57:45.019
Perfect!

57:45.021 --> 57:48.022
Exactly what we need.
Good boy.

57:48.024 --> 57:50.258
Hey, take two guys with you
to the dairy.

57:50.260 --> 57:52.894
Take care of the one
who can't produce milk.

57:52.896 --> 57:54.931
I'll take care of him
for the rest of the day.

01:00:56.916 --> 01:00:57.948
Alec?

01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:59.083
Oh, my God.

01:00:59.085 --> 01:01:00.250
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:00.252 --> 01:01:02.219
- Are they around?
- No.

01:01:02.221 --> 01:01:04.321
- Come on, come on.
- Let's get out of here.

01:01:04.323 --> 01:01:06.258
- Okay, I got you.
- Come on.

01:02:25.105 --> 01:02:26.772
There.

01:02:26.774 --> 01:02:28.707
Okay.

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:53.534
Okay.

01:03:26.634 --> 01:03:28.735
- We gotta go now. Now.
- Okay.

01:03:28.737 --> 01:03:30.137
Come on.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:13.576
Nora.

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.379
- Nora, they're coming.
- Okay.

01:06:14.505 --> 01:06:16.640
Oh, shit.

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:19.677
Come on.

01:06:29.921 --> 01:06:32.623
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:07:41.493 --> 01:07:42.494
Patrick.

01:08:12.992 --> 01:08:15.559
Hey, how do I get out of here?

01:08:15.561 --> 01:08:19.062
Please, please, please,
how do I get out of here?

01:08:19.064 --> 01:08:21.000
Please.

01:08:23.469 --> 01:08:25.903
The bus they used
to transport us.

01:08:25.904 --> 01:08:28.971
There's a key in the room
in the back of the house.

01:08:28.974 --> 01:08:31.008
You can find it
by the window.

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:33.011
Thank you, thank you.

01:13:18.768 --> 01:13:19.937
Ashley.

01:13:21.138 --> 01:13:23.772
Ashley, come on.

01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:25.440
What are you doing?
How did you get out?

01:13:25.442 --> 01:13:27.175
It's okay.
Come on, let's go. Shh!

01:13:27.177 --> 01:13:29.947
- They're gonna find us!
- Shh!

01:13:45.062 --> 01:13:47.264
Keys. Come on, let's go.
Keys.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:05.350
- Okay, stay here.
- Okay.

01:14:21.099 --> 01:14:24.035
Okay, let's go.
Run, run.

01:14:43.288 --> 01:14:44.420
Yes. Yes!

01:14:44.422 --> 01:14:47.158
Yes!
