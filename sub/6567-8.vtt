WEBVTT

00:00.163 --> 00:02.834
We are known as
the Sons of Mithras.

00:03.408 --> 00:06.879
Ignis fatuus, that's what this
Sons of Mithras business is.

00:07.085 --> 00:08.986
If I marry Camilla Pazzi...

00:08.992 --> 00:11.661
You and I can still snatch a
little freedom here and there.

00:11.729 --> 00:13.731
Do we kill Lorenzo
coming up the path?

00:13.798 --> 00:15.132
Strike only when
the brothers are together.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.734
Lucrezia Donati?

00:16.802 --> 00:19.337
Saddle the horses for Siena.
We'll question her directly.

00:19.405 --> 00:21.973
- And here's our final savior.
- Gentlemen.

00:22.041 --> 00:25.178
What possesses you
to betray Lorenzo, to betray us all?

00:25.245 --> 00:29.883
- You are Lucrezia Donati's father.
- Indeed.

00:32.854 --> 00:35.422
L'Artista,
I see you escaped.

00:35.490 --> 00:36.758
And I see a key.

00:36.825 --> 00:40.328
Cosimo de Medici
was a Son of Mithras.

00:40.396 --> 00:42.865
A ship provisioned
for a journey.

00:42.932 --> 00:45.167
The Vault of Heaven
is out there.

Allahu Akbar.

02:07.754 --> 02:10.389
Allahu Akbar.

02:14.895 --> 02:18.898
What does the future hold
for the Sons of Mithras, Al-Rahim?

02:18.965 --> 02:21.433
Augury is a tricky business.

02:21.501 --> 02:23.035
I see grim tidings.

02:23.102 --> 02:26.672
Darkness, despair.

02:26.739 --> 02:28.874
The usual cant
and caper, then.

02:28.942 --> 02:32.711
You would make light of our
circumstances, Cosimo de Medici?

02:32.779 --> 02:36.815
Light is the only thing
that sustains me, my friend.

02:38.485 --> 02:41.954
Are there no bright spots
on the horizon, then?

02:42.021 --> 02:45.858
There is one,
a boy from Vinci.

02:45.925 --> 02:48.327
He has promise.

02:48.394 --> 02:51.663
Even now, events conspire to
bring him to Florence.

02:51.731 --> 02:53.232
Am I to keep an eye on him?

02:53.299 --> 02:55.233
Only from a distance.

02:55.301 --> 02:59.137
He must ascend or fall
by his own devices.

02:59.205 --> 03:01.840
And speaking of devices,

03:01.908 --> 03:05.911
we give you this
for safe-keeping.

03:05.979 --> 03:09.248
Someone will come for this when
it is time to make the journey.

03:10.317 --> 03:13.352
Perhaps, the boy Al-Rahim
speaks of.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.721
Assuming he
survives his trial.

03:15.789 --> 03:17.990
I have faith he will.

03:18.058 --> 03:20.926
If I'm to keep
the candles burning,

03:20.994 --> 03:24.729
I'll need more reassurances
than faith and a vague prophecy.

03:57.961 --> 04:01.297
I'm afraid I cannot give you
any reassurances.

04:01.365 --> 04:06.269
If the future indicated by
these signs comes to pass,

04:06.337 --> 04:09.739
only one of us
will live to see it.

04:09.807 --> 04:13.343
So which lucky one
gets to survive?

04:13.410 --> 04:16.144
You misunderstand.

04:16.213 --> 04:18.481
The dead will
be the lucky ones.

04:18.548 --> 04:22.518
The one who lives
to see this future...

04:22.586 --> 04:25.020
..he will truly suffer.

04:39.569 --> 04:41.971
I'm going to miss
this place.

04:44.975 --> 04:48.644
And you. I'll miss you as well,
my friends.

04:52.982 --> 04:55.263
We've followed you into more
scrapes than I care to count.

04:55.285 --> 04:56.785
Why not add another
to the tally?

04:56.853 --> 04:59.488
I can't ask you to follow me
across an ocean.

04:59.556 --> 05:02.390
We want to,
Maestro.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.025
The Vault of Heaven,
the Book of Leaves,

05:04.093 --> 05:06.128
we want to be there
when you find them.

05:06.195 --> 05:07.763
The boy's a half-wit
moon-calf

05:07.830 --> 05:10.165
who'd smother his balls in
ox dung if you told him to.

05:10.233 --> 05:13.502
As for me? I've accrued
some gambling debts

05:13.569 --> 05:15.838
that make my near-term residence
in Florence problematic.

05:15.905 --> 05:19.642
So where to next?
We'll need a ship, won't we?

05:23.480 --> 05:24.714
The Portuguese
are establishing

05:24.782 --> 05:26.103
trade routes
along Western Africa.

05:26.150 --> 05:27.751
We'll book passage to
the Canary Islands.

05:27.818 --> 05:30.954
After that,
we'll have to improvise.

05:33.558 --> 05:36.527
First, I've certain accounts to
settle with the House of Medici.

05:36.595 --> 05:39.629
Why bother with the Medicis?
Why not skirt Florence entirely?

05:39.697 --> 05:43.600
There are things I have
to say to Lorenzo.

05:43.668 --> 05:45.669
Words for his ears alone.

05:50.408 --> 05:52.977
Shall we meet at the
Barking Dog this evening?

05:53.045 --> 05:57.349
<i>Why not? A pint, one last foray</i>
<i>into a Florentine slit for luck.</i>

05:57.416 --> 05:59.117
<i>We can see if Nico's balls</i>
<i>have dropped.</i>

05:59.185 --> 06:00.452
That's odd.

06:00.519 --> 06:02.420
That's a Lanner Falcon.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.589
<i>They're rare this side</i>
<i>of the Adriatic.</i>

06:04.657 --> 06:06.424
<i>Turkey, Africa, yes.</i>
<i>But here?</i>

06:06.492 --> 06:10.529
- It lost its way. It happens.
- No, not often.

06:10.596 --> 06:13.732
The last time
I saw a Lanner

06:14.967 --> 06:17.335
was the day my mother
disappeared.

06:21.641 --> 06:25.276
- You say they hail from Turkey?
- Mm.

06:25.344 --> 06:28.079
I'll wager that bird's
an omen, meant for you alone.

06:29.782 --> 06:31.749
I should follow it.

06:31.817 --> 06:34.777
I said it's an omen. If anything, you
should ride in the opposite direction.

06:34.786 --> 06:37.087
- I'll meet you at the Dog.
- Leo!

07:31.078 --> 07:32.812
Yah!

08:19.026 --> 08:22.762
I take it you now believe
in visions...

08:25.867 --> 08:28.535
..and demons?

08:55.862 --> 08:57.997
Where can be Giuliano be?

08:58.064 --> 09:01.767
How badly did you handle your talk
with him about this marriage?

09:01.835 --> 09:03.569
He knew he had
to wed the girl.

09:03.637 --> 09:05.605
He agreed there
was no other way

09:05.672 --> 09:07.273
to halt our feud
with the Pazzis,

09:07.341 --> 09:11.044
yet I've not seen
a trace of him for days.

09:11.111 --> 09:13.412
Did you actually hear him
utter the words, "I agree",

09:13.480 --> 09:16.515
or did you only hear
what you wanted to hear?

09:25.225 --> 09:26.792
<i>He agreed.</i>

09:38.606 --> 09:41.875
Giuliano may
not arrive at all.

09:41.942 --> 09:43.843
I say we strike.

09:43.911 --> 09:46.913
Kill Lorenzo and Clarice
while we have them here.

09:46.981 --> 09:51.484
Are you so blind to the success
of your rivals?

09:51.552 --> 09:54.687
The brothers are popular.

09:54.755 --> 09:56.690
Murdering only one will
allow the survivor

09:56.757 --> 09:58.959
to rally the city
against us.

09:59.026 --> 10:02.429
Only with the shock
of losing both men at once

10:02.497 --> 10:04.064
will Florence
bow to new leaders.

10:04.132 --> 10:07.000
You can send your men after
Giuliano, wherever he is.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.671
I can handle
Lorenzo myself.

10:10.738 --> 10:14.975
Do so and you defy the will
of Rome, Francesco.

10:15.810 --> 10:17.444
I warn you now.

10:25.087 --> 10:27.021
Remarkable.

10:29.491 --> 10:31.793
According to lore,

10:31.860 --> 10:36.531
these will open
the Vault of Heaven.

10:36.598 --> 10:41.436
Solomon Ogbai, the Abyssinian,
told you its location?

10:41.504 --> 10:43.805
He told me it rested

10:43.873 --> 10:47.108
on an old peak,
in a town made of stone.

10:47.176 --> 10:49.945
Beneath something called "the
hitching post of the sun."

10:50.013 --> 10:53.282
With these keys and
the map to the Vault itself,

10:53.350 --> 10:57.653
it would appear the Book of Leaves
lies firmly within our grasp.

10:57.721 --> 10:59.681
When was the last time
the Book was actually seen?

10:59.723 --> 11:02.191
A thousand years ago.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.594
When the Library
of Alexandria burned.

11:04.661 --> 11:07.229
Yet we still have faith
it exists.

11:07.297 --> 11:08.965
Faith.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.069
It always comes down to that,
doesn't it?

11:13.137 --> 11:15.872
Never anything that can be
proven. Just...

11:15.940 --> 11:19.675
It's just smoke.

11:19.743 --> 11:22.178
It's tales by the camp fire.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.580
You're angry.

11:23.647 --> 11:27.817
Pope Sixtus claims you're
an agent of the Ottomans.

11:27.885 --> 11:30.653
The Sons of Mithras
are not constrained

11:30.721 --> 11:32.823
by geographic borders.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.392
Our stewardship
encompasses all mankind.

11:35.460 --> 11:38.495
Well, this particular man

11:38.563 --> 11:41.498
is tired
of being manipulated.

11:41.566 --> 11:46.270
If you are lost in a forest
and you see a landmark,

11:46.338 --> 11:51.542
is that landmark manipulating
you along a certain path?

11:52.811 --> 11:56.014
I am merely your guide.

11:56.081 --> 12:00.519
But if I ignore
your chosen path, then--

12:00.586 --> 12:04.456
I'll never
find my mother, will I?

12:10.296 --> 12:12.498
She's a poor
little thing.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.100
Mending Camilla Pazzi's heart
will be the least of our concerns

12:15.168 --> 12:17.436
if my brother sabotages
this feast.

12:17.504 --> 12:21.907
The snub could propel us all into
still more years of blood feud.

12:21.975 --> 12:25.377
Look at Francesco.
Look at them all.

12:25.444 --> 12:29.381
- The Pazzis glower like that.
- Exactly.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.516
Today was supposed to be
different.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.718
How long should we wait?

12:33.786 --> 12:37.055
Always so impatient, Francesco.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.057
Talk with them.

12:39.125 --> 12:43.561
Complain of the scandal
of Giuliano's absence.

12:43.629 --> 12:46.864
Your anger at the cur's
impudence

12:46.932 --> 12:49.501
will disguise
your desire to kill.

12:49.568 --> 12:53.371
Or it may just spur me
to strike even faster.

12:59.311 --> 13:03.881
Captain, tracking the comings and goings
of Florentines is your specialty.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.683
Where is my brother?

13:05.751 --> 13:07.585
I cannot say.

13:07.653 --> 13:10.288
A week ago, my Officer Bertino
asked permission

13:10.356 --> 13:12.391
to accompany
Giuliano to Siena.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.526
I've seen neither
of them since.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.061
Why Siena?

13:16.129 --> 13:19.197
Giuliano,

13:19.265 --> 13:21.967
apparently longed for one last
fling before his nuptials.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.803
The pious Bertino promised to
keep him from too much trouble.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.006
What if Bertino failed?

13:27.074 --> 13:29.141
What if Giuliano
was waylaid on the road?

13:29.209 --> 13:31.010
Surely that's the only
reason he'd insult us

13:31.078 --> 13:32.711
with his
absence today.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.980
Take a few men
and search the roads

13:35.047 --> 13:36.381
between Florence
and Siena.

13:36.448 --> 13:39.784
All of us yearn to know what has
become of Giuliano, Captain.

13:39.852 --> 13:43.787
Settle the matter for us.
Please.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.527
There is a ship bound for
Cape Verde, the Basilisk.

13:49.595 --> 13:53.097
Under the command
of Antonio de Noli.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.867
As we speak,
de Noli is in Florence,

13:56.935 --> 14:00.471
loading a barge with provisions
for a journey.

14:00.539 --> 14:02.840
<i>At dawn, he takes</i>
<i>the barge to Pisa,</i>

14:02.908 --> 14:04.442
<i>where the Basilisk</i>
<i>is anchored.</i>

14:04.510 --> 14:09.580
You, Leonardo, must book passage
on that ship.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.215
With your
navigational skills,

14:11.283 --> 14:14.352
the Basilisk will survive
the storms

14:14.419 --> 14:17.822
and reach another land
entirely,

14:17.890 --> 14:20.759
where the Book of Leaves awaits.

14:20.827 --> 14:24.497
Some years ago, a magician promised
me he would hide something for you.

14:24.565 --> 14:26.032
A magician?

14:28.436 --> 14:30.003
Cosimo de Medici?

14:30.071 --> 14:34.174
Cached within Cosimo's tomb
is a mariner's astrolabe.

14:34.242 --> 14:37.411
With it, you will navigate
the Basilisk safely

14:37.479 --> 14:40.547
to the lands
indicated on the map.

14:40.615 --> 14:46.253
Cosimo hid it in a way that
only you would solve his riddle.

14:48.823 --> 14:52.892
As ever, you know the right
games to tantalize me.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.996
You must carry the astrolabe
onto that barge.

14:56.063 --> 15:00.600
The Book of Leaves,
of your mother's fate,

15:00.667 --> 15:02.935
will remain a mystery.

15:08.742 --> 15:13.112
Isn't this the moment
where you spin a coin,

15:13.179 --> 15:14.379
put me into a trance?

15:14.447 --> 15:17.249
No coins.

15:17.316 --> 15:19.851
No trances.

15:21.253 --> 15:26.124
You either book passage West
or you don't.

15:27.392 --> 15:32.062
You succeed or you fail.

15:32.130 --> 15:37.467
The choice and the consequences
are yours.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.442
- Be still, child.
- I'm going to be sick.

15:44.509 --> 15:48.613
You're already sick. No-one
calls for me if they're well.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.948
Here. Hold this.

15:54.553 --> 15:57.021
You've not stepped over
a grave, have you?

15:57.089 --> 15:58.856
Or drunk milk
that's gone to spoil?

15:58.923 --> 16:00.991
No, Ottavia.
Nothing like that.

16:01.059 --> 16:04.160
Here. Piss into this.

16:04.228 --> 16:08.464
I saw a butcher's daughter last week,
blubbering on about a malady akin to this.

16:08.532 --> 16:12.501
Had to split her open.
Worms.

16:19.475 --> 16:22.744
Oh. Cloudy as a winter's dawn.

16:22.812 --> 16:24.846
Is that bad?

16:24.914 --> 16:28.483
A pinch or two of this
every two days,

16:28.551 --> 16:32.021
and be sure to stay out
of the light of the moon.

16:32.088 --> 16:35.458
Not for your
sake but for his.

16:35.525 --> 16:37.293
For who?

16:37.361 --> 16:40.330
Your son. You're
not with worms, girl.

16:40.397 --> 16:42.165
You're with child.

16:45.103 --> 16:46.970
Bring me to him.

16:52.611 --> 16:57.548
I've sent Clarice away to spare her
whatever tragedy you may have brought here.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.719
Delay no more. Show me.

17:04.990 --> 17:09.291
My Officer Bertino.
Found on the road to Siena.

17:09.359 --> 17:13.096
Hacked to death. Bandits?

17:13.164 --> 17:16.900
Most likely. Yet we found
no trace of Giuliano.

17:19.303 --> 17:24.205
Take more men.
Find him, alive or dead.

17:24.273 --> 17:26.642
<i>I must know my brother's fate.</i>

17:39.790 --> 17:41.892
Where am I?

17:41.959 --> 17:44.361
In the Val d'Elsa, Signor.

17:44.428 --> 17:47.497
We found you in the river,
more dead than alive.

17:47.565 --> 17:49.833
I nursed your wounds.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.235
I thank you for that.

17:52.303 --> 17:57.007
Soon as I seen your clothes,
I knew you was a nobleman.

17:57.075 --> 17:58.675
And yet, you didn't rob me.

17:58.743 --> 18:00.878
Wouldn't be Christian.

18:09.821 --> 18:11.489
What day is it?
How long have I been out?

18:11.556 --> 18:13.758
Holy Saturday, Signor.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.993
When they laid Christ's body
in the tomb.

18:16.061 --> 18:18.696
Argh!

18:18.764 --> 18:21.299
I have to get
back to Florence.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.334
I need to warn Lorenzo.

18:23.401 --> 18:25.402
You need to rest, son.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.004
I can't.

18:27.072 --> 18:28.706
No time.

18:33.044 --> 18:36.914
Hm. The dead still walk.

18:36.981 --> 18:40.384
I assumed you had to be dead.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.622
Some said you traveled to
Wallachia, others to Rome.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.625
- Which was it?
- Both.

18:47.692 --> 18:49.994
Ah. Both.

18:50.061 --> 18:54.332
So why are we meeting
here? Hm?

18:54.399 --> 18:57.368
What intrigue are you
involving me in this time?

18:57.436 --> 19:00.838
This tomb, you designed it
for Cosimo?

19:00.906 --> 19:02.407
To an extent.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.009
Like Cosimo's portrait,

19:05.077 --> 19:07.878
is it possible this tomb
contains secret mysteries?

19:11.883 --> 19:15.453
This mosaic,
see how the circles

19:15.520 --> 19:17.822
weave through the design.

19:17.889 --> 19:22.059
Step back
and focus only on that.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.402
King Solomon's Knot.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.972
The ancient symbol representing
the wisdom of eternity.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.406
Yes.

19:39.378 --> 19:42.847
Other men live among
the trappings of this world.

19:42.915 --> 19:47.385
But Cosimo's face was
always turned beyond

19:47.453 --> 19:49.687
worldly distractions

19:49.755 --> 19:51.089
to the universe above.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.902
He had the most agile mind
I've ever known...

20:06.407 --> 20:08.708
..until I met you.

20:14.682 --> 20:17.518
You honor me.

20:17.585 --> 20:22.323
You're the closest thing
I've ever known to a father.

20:23.358 --> 20:25.526
I'm about to
leave you again.

20:27.295 --> 20:31.665
This time, on a quest
from which I may never return.

20:35.036 --> 20:38.072
Every question you answer
leads to another question.

20:38.139 --> 20:43.043
And such quests lead many
to nothing but misery.

20:44.546 --> 20:47.514
The true misery

20:47.582 --> 20:51.585
is if all the questions
are solved,

20:51.653 --> 20:55.189
cos then there's
nothing left to ask.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.362
- Where do you voyage now?
- It depends on what I find here.

21:01.430 --> 21:03.298
I designed no
secret compartment.

21:03.365 --> 21:06.434
Ah! But--

21:06.502 --> 21:09.370
but the Magician

21:09.438 --> 21:12.474
could install one without
anyone knowing.

21:12.541 --> 21:15.077
Like a flaw.

21:15.144 --> 21:18.547
Cosimo would never have
permitted it.

21:18.615 --> 21:20.982
And yet...

21:21.050 --> 21:24.252
Look. Look! Do you see?

21:24.320 --> 21:28.524
It's exactly the same as
the semi-circles

21:28.592 --> 21:30.226
in King Solomon's Knot.

21:30.293 --> 21:34.597
And Cosimo's gaze
reflected

21:34.665 --> 21:36.365
on Libra,

21:36.433 --> 21:38.400
the scales
of balance.

21:38.468 --> 21:41.503
Perhaps there's a matching
discrepancy?

21:41.571 --> 21:44.974
Here. Do you see?
There. Look.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.943
Do they form an axis?

21:48.010 --> 21:53.214
Well, if so, then there must be
another axis that crosses it.

21:53.282 --> 21:54.682
Exactly.

21:54.749 --> 21:56.683
Starting here.

21:56.751 --> 21:59.954
Then its mate would be...

22:00.022 --> 22:02.190
Here. Look.

22:02.257 --> 22:03.891
The center of the knot

22:03.959 --> 22:07.629
would be--

22:07.697 --> 22:10.398
directly
above the heart.

22:42.065 --> 22:44.933
The question answered.

22:45.001 --> 22:47.535
Which leads
to another question.

22:49.338 --> 22:51.106
Yes.

22:51.173 --> 22:54.209
Magnificently so.

23:17.502 --> 23:20.604
Signor!

23:23.675 --> 23:26.743
Signor Medici,
where have you been?

23:28.179 --> 23:29.546
What's befallen you?

23:29.614 --> 23:33.150
Treachery.
A moment alone, Captain?

23:37.989 --> 23:42.726
Bertino and I determined
Lucrezia Donati to be a spy.

23:42.793 --> 23:44.594
You cannot mean it.

23:44.662 --> 23:48.431
We sought her out in Siena, and came
across her being attacked by bandits.

23:48.499 --> 23:53.335
We dispatched them but at
the cost of Bertino's life.

23:53.403 --> 23:56.005
Lucrezia stabbed me.

23:56.072 --> 23:57.973
Left me for dead.

23:58.041 --> 24:02.011
She is an agent of
and Riario and Pope Sixtus.

24:02.078 --> 24:06.949
Capaldi! Ride with Black Martin.
Tell Lorenzo Giuliano lives.

24:07.017 --> 24:11.421
I will escort him home at a pace
his wounds allow. Go. Go!

24:11.488 --> 24:14.424
Thank you, Captain,
for your consideration.

24:14.491 --> 24:16.826
It is nothing.

24:18.061 --> 24:21.430
Someone needs to tend to you.

24:21.498 --> 24:24.033
We had a contract.

24:24.101 --> 24:26.269
You break it and
I will be justified

24:26.336 --> 24:28.437
in depriving you
of your freedom.

24:28.505 --> 24:30.673
And what happened
to the last man

24:30.741 --> 24:32.642
who tried to pen me up
in Florence?

24:32.710 --> 24:34.410
You'll find me more
of a match to you

24:34.478 --> 24:37.747
than that
hapless magistrate.

24:39.450 --> 24:41.417
I would.

24:41.485 --> 24:44.654
What about a small duchy
of your own?

24:44.722 --> 24:46.957
That would give you
the freedom to amass

24:47.025 --> 24:48.892
all the knowledge
you like.

24:51.262 --> 24:54.898
And you have duchies
sitting around

24:54.965 --> 24:56.966
to hand out
like party favors?

24:57.033 --> 25:02.004
The Duke of Urbino and I made an
alliance to move on the Papacy.

25:02.071 --> 25:05.006
That will give us
the ability to give you

25:05.074 --> 25:07.843
the legitimacy
you have never had.

25:12.882 --> 25:15.283
I suspect your
alliance is dead.

25:18.187 --> 25:21.523
At the Vatican I saw
the Duke of Urbino himself.

25:21.591 --> 25:24.693
One can't miss the man.
He looked quite at home.

25:28.465 --> 25:31.333
So as you desert me,
you bring me word that

25:31.401 --> 25:33.702
my only other source
of military defense

25:35.572 --> 25:36.839
is a sham?

25:36.907 --> 25:40.042
You approached him because
you knew he had a price, yes?

25:40.110 --> 25:41.778
Someone outbid you.

25:41.845 --> 25:43.413
Fuck you.

25:44.882 --> 25:47.551
Artists approach me
all the time.

25:47.618 --> 25:50.354
They are full of
vague and glorious ideas

25:50.422 --> 25:51.822
on which they
rarely deliver.

25:51.890 --> 25:55.627
Case in point.

25:55.694 --> 25:57.528
You were warned.

25:57.596 --> 25:59.897
You were warned
in this very room.

25:59.965 --> 26:02.833
I accept many commissions,
I finish few.

26:02.901 --> 26:07.071
I gave you the chance to be the
foremost artist of your day.

26:07.139 --> 26:10.274
I gave you the most desirable
woman in Florence as a subject.

26:10.342 --> 26:12.176
She was never my subject.

26:18.583 --> 26:23.053
You and I love this city,
do we not?

26:29.093 --> 26:30.361
We do.

26:30.428 --> 26:33.564
Then help me save it.

26:33.632 --> 26:35.833
What else can I give you?

26:43.976 --> 26:45.944
What about her?

26:50.683 --> 26:55.152
Her husband's
clearly not an obstacle.

26:55.220 --> 26:59.489
You think I would just toss her
to you just like that?

26:59.557 --> 27:01.358
You have a wife.

27:01.425 --> 27:04.861
Who has her charms.
Who needs attention.

27:07.365 --> 27:12.336
How much does Lucrezia
mean to you, Lorenzo?

27:14.272 --> 27:17.708
Are you willing to set
aside your toy

27:17.776 --> 27:19.977
to keep me in Florence?

27:22.881 --> 27:27.118
Magnifico, your brother
has been found.

27:58.819 --> 28:00.887
Giuliano is alive.

28:00.955 --> 28:03.189
Wounded but alive.

28:03.257 --> 28:04.991
Who wounded him?

28:05.059 --> 28:07.294
Lucrezia Donati.

28:07.361 --> 28:10.831
- And she is also alive?
- It appears so.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.901
What was she doing
attacking Giuliano?

28:15.370 --> 28:16.937
Did she know of
your plans?

28:17.005 --> 28:20.407
<i>Giuliano is unarmed and</i>
<i>in the care of Dragonetti.</i>

28:20.475 --> 28:21.909
He won't live to
see Florence again.

28:21.976 --> 28:23.844
But if people learn Giuliano
has been killed,

28:23.912 --> 28:26.446
Lorenzo will rally
the people behind him.

28:26.514 --> 28:30.484
We must strike
at Lorenzo first.

28:33.188 --> 28:36.189
Easter Mass.

28:36.257 --> 28:39.560
Dawn tomorrow we will
poison Lorenzo in the very act

28:39.627 --> 28:41.595
of taking holy communion,

28:41.663 --> 28:45.632
and damn Cardinal Orsini's
pious hesitations.

28:45.700 --> 28:50.204
It will look as if God himself
has taken down the tyrant.

28:50.271 --> 28:52.973
- What is your name?
- Capaldi.

28:53.041 --> 28:55.410
Find Father Bagnone
and Father Maffei.

28:55.477 --> 28:58.813
Have them prepare the Host
for Lorenzo,

28:58.881 --> 29:00.982
and his wife,

29:01.050 --> 29:04.452
and all his daughters.

29:04.520 --> 29:09.157
Then ride back to Dragonetti and make
sure that Giuliano has met his death.

29:09.225 --> 29:10.492
Consider it done, my lord.

29:11.527 --> 29:16.565
Within hours...
we will own Florence.

29:18.368 --> 29:22.205
But why would Lucrezia agree
to act as Rome's catspaw?

29:22.273 --> 29:25.274
Sixtus only rewards
his own blood.

29:25.342 --> 29:29.746
Did you know he's already rewarded
six of his nephews as cardinals?

29:29.814 --> 29:32.949
- He is loyal.
- To the point of incestuousness.

29:34.251 --> 29:36.719
The virtue of a republic
like Florence

29:36.787 --> 29:38.588
is that offices go to
the most worthy,

29:38.656 --> 29:43.093
appointments are made
only on merit.

29:43.161 --> 29:48.599
I dare say you earned your rank on the
basis of achievement, Dragonetti?

29:48.667 --> 29:50.534
I did.

29:50.602 --> 29:52.736
And you demonstrate
that repeatedly.

29:54.472 --> 29:56.773
The details in your curfew
ledgers -

29:56.841 --> 29:59.576
without them, Bertino and I
could never have uncovered

29:59.643 --> 30:01.778
the name of
Lorenzo's betrayer.

30:01.846 --> 30:04.648
All one needed was the time
to study the records.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.857
And you had the time,
of course.

30:14.692 --> 30:17.394
I do take my work seriously.

30:25.303 --> 30:28.539
That's how she was able to
avoid detection after curfew, isn't it?

30:28.606 --> 30:31.508
She had the perfect alibi,
fucking my brother,

30:31.576 --> 30:34.545
and because the first man to raise
questions about her activities

30:34.612 --> 30:37.180
was already in league
with Rome himself.

30:43.888 --> 30:46.856
I could try
and ride away.

30:46.924 --> 30:50.560
But you're unwounded,
your mount is fresher.

30:52.663 --> 30:55.131
Finish what your spy
began, then.

30:55.199 --> 30:57.534
Perhaps she'll reward you
between her legs.

30:57.602 --> 30:59.937
- That is not what spurs me.
- What does?

31:00.005 --> 31:03.407
A desire for a Florence
that fears God,

31:03.474 --> 31:05.342
not its masters.

31:05.410 --> 31:07.544
Let's get to
your brother's side.

31:18.021 --> 31:19.989
De Noli's barge,
bound for Pisa?

31:20.057 --> 31:21.658
Aye, Signor.

31:21.725 --> 31:23.993
How much to book passage
for three?

31:24.061 --> 31:26.429
We take only freight
and baggage.

31:34.438 --> 31:38.774
I told you,
only freight and baggage.

31:38.842 --> 31:41.644
I have to board the Basilisk.

31:41.712 --> 31:43.613
Yeah, you're beginning
to look like baggage.

31:50.822 --> 31:53.090
Dawn tomorrow.
Don't be late.

31:55.527 --> 31:59.496
Each of my brigades awaits
near one of these gates.

31:59.564 --> 32:02.633
You may consider Florence
already under our control.

32:05.970 --> 32:09.373
- Your men are loyal to you?
- But of course.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.609
Because if they get battle-hungry
and invade prematurely,

32:12.676 --> 32:14.777
the Florentines
will rise against them.

32:14.845 --> 32:18.648
The Florentines are
shopkeepers and clerks.

32:18.716 --> 32:20.083
We're soldiers.

32:20.151 --> 32:22.919
The Florentines live in narrow
corridors and alleyways

32:22.987 --> 32:25.489
where they can strike
unexpectedly.

32:25.557 --> 32:28.459
If they rise to fight
for their home,

32:28.527 --> 32:32.162
it will not resemble the
fields of battle you know.

32:32.230 --> 32:36.466
We have new weapons
for street warfare.

32:36.534 --> 32:38.101
You will follow our lead.

32:38.169 --> 32:40.938
The Pazzis' role in all this
is to overthrow the tyrants,

32:41.005 --> 32:43.073
establish a clear new regime.

32:43.141 --> 32:47.711
While your role is only
to appear if summoned

32:47.779 --> 32:50.381
to cement the
powers-that-will-be into place.

32:50.448 --> 32:53.317
If I choose to move
on Florence myself...

32:56.121 --> 32:57.655
..who are you to stop me?

32:57.723 --> 33:02.060
Tell, me, who is it
that pays your men?

33:04.197 --> 33:06.765
You sit in the middle,
conveying their wages

33:06.833 --> 33:10.969
which issue from the vaults
of Rome.

33:11.037 --> 33:12.904
Act against me,

33:12.972 --> 33:16.441
and that same city
shall brand you a heretic,

33:16.509 --> 33:20.545
strip you of your titles,
and excommunicate you.

33:20.613 --> 33:22.714
Resist further,
and His Holiness

33:22.782 --> 33:25.116
will have that metal eyepiece
of yours melted down

33:25.184 --> 33:28.753
and poured over your testicles in
the middle of the Piazza Navona.

33:30.389 --> 33:34.760
I've seen what he's capable
of with...both of my eyes.

33:43.536 --> 33:45.504
Your man returns.

33:45.571 --> 33:47.472
Perhaps with news
from my brother.

33:47.540 --> 33:48.973
He comes not from
Il Magnifico -

33:49.041 --> 33:51.008
but from Count Riario -

33:51.076 --> 33:53.010
to confirm I've killed you.

33:57.749 --> 34:00.551
Why is he not riding away
with news I'm still alive?

34:00.619 --> 34:04.188
I think he has another plan.

34:04.256 --> 34:06.323
Hold.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.728
- What are you doing?
- What's best for Florence.

34:14.266 --> 34:17.534
Aargh!

34:19.504 --> 34:22.940
Pick up his sword.

34:23.007 --> 34:26.342
You'll need a weapon if you're
going to save your brother.

34:26.411 --> 34:30.147
Do it now, Giuliano. Before
I change my mind again.

35:07.384 --> 35:08.618
It's me.

35:08.685 --> 35:10.753
You think I don't know
your footsteps?

35:19.363 --> 35:21.898
Give me a reason...

35:21.965 --> 35:25.668
why I shouldn't puncture
your neck this instant.

35:28.005 --> 35:30.907
Not today.

35:30.975 --> 35:34.144
You poisoned Vanessa and I risked
dementia trying to save her.

35:34.212 --> 35:37.448
You shared the secrets of my
war machinery with Riario

35:37.516 --> 35:39.616
and put the city at peril.

35:39.684 --> 35:42.820
This...this denunciation

35:42.888 --> 35:46.056
that names me
a sexual criminal,

35:46.124 --> 35:48.358
had me thrown
in jail to face the bonfire.

35:48.426 --> 35:51.695
This is your work!

35:51.763 --> 35:55.732
I had Nico send you to the convent
to keep your friend alive.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.402
I begged for your mercy
during the trial

35:58.469 --> 36:00.203
and made enemies
who seek my life.

36:00.271 --> 36:03.673
You will never understand
the risks I have taken...

36:03.741 --> 36:07.176
- To keep your father alive.
- What?

36:07.244 --> 36:11.081
I know. I know.

36:11.149 --> 36:14.651
He wishes me to tell you
how much he loves you.

36:16.320 --> 36:19.255
I spoke with him in his cell
in Castel Sant'angelo.

36:19.323 --> 36:23.593
Then you grasp the hold
they have maintained over me.

36:25.295 --> 36:28.297
It's a hold so strong...

36:28.365 --> 36:33.402
..that you would even poison
an innocent man.

36:37.474 --> 36:40.910
And what of the risks you have
faced in search of your mother?

36:40.977 --> 36:42.512
Huh?

36:42.579 --> 36:44.180
If it fell to you
to keep her alive,

36:44.248 --> 36:46.482
would you say "No, I'll
preserve another's life"?

36:46.550 --> 36:48.051
I would find another way.

36:48.118 --> 36:51.120
Yeah, how easy it is
for you to believe that.

36:53.023 --> 36:57.026
I would understand
your actions, Lucrezia...

36:57.094 --> 37:00.796
..if your father hadn't rejected
my offer to set him free.

37:00.863 --> 37:03.232
- You're lying.
- No.

37:03.299 --> 37:07.436
You've committed
these sins for nothing.

37:18.348 --> 37:22.484
Your work argues that man
is capable of anything.

37:24.854 --> 37:26.988
Well, between us,
we prove it.

37:28.957 --> 37:33.561
You show us the heights that we can
reach and I show us the depths.

37:55.218 --> 37:56.517
Of late...

37:59.989 --> 38:03.458
..I've met men
who dwell in shadows,

38:03.525 --> 38:07.996
speaking of...
other times and other lives.

38:11.934 --> 38:16.437
Maybe...
if they're correct...

38:19.307 --> 38:21.976
..a life exists
in which we...

38:22.043 --> 38:24.312
Yes. Yes.

38:24.379 --> 38:26.781
Yes.

38:32.053 --> 38:33.720
No, I can't do this.
I can't.

38:33.788 --> 38:35.689
- Please. Please.
- I can't. I can't.

38:35.756 --> 38:38.258
I have to go.
I have to...

38:38.326 --> 38:42.730
A ship waits in Pisa to take
me to the Book Of Leaves.

38:42.798 --> 38:43.998
If I'm not on the Basilisk...

38:44.066 --> 38:46.801
Riario and the Pazzis
are moving on Florence.

38:46.868 --> 38:51.238
- They want to kill Lorenzo.
- I could care less, what they do.

38:51.306 --> 38:54.843
Let the politicians kill each
other, that's their forte.

38:54.910 --> 38:58.647
Leonardo, please, you are
only one who can stop this.

39:00.016 --> 39:02.484
If you're not going to do it
for me or for Lorenzo,

39:02.552 --> 39:05.654
then do it for Florence.

39:05.722 --> 39:08.124
For Florence?

39:08.191 --> 39:12.261
For Florence? The city
that turned its back on me?

39:13.564 --> 39:16.466
The bastard son?

39:16.534 --> 39:18.301
The sodomite?

39:20.538 --> 39:23.339
A younger Da Vinci might've
bought your arguments, Lucrezia.

39:23.407 --> 39:26.775
But...I've endured too much
these last few months

39:26.843 --> 39:28.810
to be swayed by sentiment.

39:32.215 --> 39:33.548
It's Easter.

39:36.285 --> 39:38.520
If Florence demands
a sacrifice...

39:42.258 --> 39:45.026
..I suggest
you offer yourself.

40:29.671 --> 40:33.941
You still endeavor to taint the
air with that foul stench, I see.

40:35.410 --> 40:38.112
A vice.

40:38.179 --> 40:40.882
One that Girolamo
sees fit to allow me.

40:40.949 --> 40:44.451
Not the only one.

40:44.519 --> 40:47.988
I've never understood your
obsession with this game.

40:48.056 --> 40:52.226
I imagine you've played
thousands of times,

40:52.294 --> 40:54.128
and what has it brought you?

40:54.196 --> 40:57.531
Know thy self,

40:57.599 --> 40:59.266
know thine enemy.

40:59.334 --> 41:01.602
It is but a recreation.

41:01.670 --> 41:04.105
True strategic mastery

41:04.172 --> 41:08.776
must be forged
in the arena of life.

41:08.844 --> 41:12.147
- Happy Easter.
- Indeed.

41:12.214 --> 41:16.518
For today brings not only
the resurrection of Christ...

41:16.586 --> 41:21.156
..but the resurrection of
Florence under Rome's rule.

41:21.224 --> 41:26.129
Soon, all the Italian
states will fall into line.

41:26.197 --> 41:28.165
I will then
turn my attention

41:28.232 --> 41:31.635
to the true enemy of God...

41:31.703 --> 41:35.005
..the Ottoman Empire.

41:35.073 --> 41:38.142
A final Holy War.

41:38.209 --> 41:41.611
A glorious victory for which
I will be made...

41:41.679 --> 41:45.514
a saint.

41:45.582 --> 41:47.483
<i>Beware of practicing</i>
<i>your righteousness</i>

41:47.551 --> 41:51.454
<i>before other people</i>
<i>in order to be seen by them,</i>

41:51.521 --> 41:55.524
for then there will be
no reward from your Father...

41:55.592 --> 41:57.259
who is in heaven.

42:01.665 --> 42:05.569
I must thank you.

42:05.637 --> 42:09.673
For without you, I could never
have achieved today's triumph.

42:09.741 --> 42:13.811
<i>And for this,</i>
<i>perhaps you would offer me...</i>

42:13.879 --> 42:16.547
..something in return?

42:16.615 --> 42:18.149
Hmm.

42:18.216 --> 42:23.487
I believe it's time
you and I...

42:25.557 --> 42:28.626
..played another game.

42:31.296 --> 42:35.600
Don't you agree... Brother?

42:53.419 --> 42:55.687
Is all in place?

42:55.755 --> 42:58.756
Fathers Bagnone and Maffei
are preparing the poison.

42:58.824 --> 43:00.324
And the Cardinal?

43:00.392 --> 43:04.095
He's too fucking pious to be
told of this change of plans.

43:04.162 --> 43:07.931
While he prays, the priests will deliver
the tainted Eucharist to Lorenzo.

43:07.999 --> 43:11.701
Quattrone. Medici loyalist.

43:11.769 --> 43:13.535
If he goes against us,

43:13.603 --> 43:15.337
he'll join Lorenzo
in the afterlife.

43:21.077 --> 43:23.178
Is there any news
of Da Vinci?

43:23.246 --> 43:25.615
The last I heard,
he was in Rome.

43:25.682 --> 43:29.418
He's countered us
again and again!

43:29.486 --> 43:31.688
Can we act if we don't know
the man's whereabouts?

43:31.756 --> 43:33.923
Calm yourself,
Francesco.

43:33.991 --> 43:38.529
We have long prepared.
All is ready.

43:49.508 --> 43:52.276
Signorina,
you make an old man...

43:52.344 --> 43:55.346
believe in the perfectibility
of mankind.

43:55.414 --> 43:57.181
Thank you, Maestro.

43:58.583 --> 44:02.286
What troubles you,
Vanessa?

44:02.354 --> 44:05.255
Have you seen Giuliano
de Medici?

44:05.323 --> 44:09.192
I must speak to him.
He needs to hear this.

44:11.895 --> 44:15.264
Quickly,
before the Cardinal sees.

44:15.331 --> 44:18.166
Ensure that these wafers
go to the Medicis,

44:18.234 --> 44:19.835
and only the Medicis.

44:19.903 --> 44:23.106
And then we can truly
celebrate this mass.

45:18.863 --> 45:20.630
Happy Easter, Lorenzo.

45:22.533 --> 45:24.100
And to you,
Francesco.

45:27.871 --> 45:29.405
Where is Giuliano?

45:29.473 --> 45:31.640
I'm sure Dragonetti
will bring him straight here.

45:35.312 --> 45:37.279
I'm sure of nothing today.

45:43.220 --> 45:46.089
God's trousers, Leo. Where the
fuck have you been all night?

45:48.092 --> 45:50.394
Only haunted
by a final farewell.

45:50.462 --> 45:54.231
The barge is loaded and the
captain's keen to depart.

45:54.299 --> 45:57.401
Impatient canker blossom threatened to
double the fee if he waited any longer.

46:03.208 --> 46:07.411
Well...then let's
save some coin

46:07.478 --> 46:09.713
and be on our way.

46:11.349 --> 46:12.749
What's this?

46:12.816 --> 46:16.452
This is us asking the Fates
where the fuck you've been.

46:16.520 --> 46:20.857
The Chariot. Reversed?

46:20.925 --> 46:23.627
Uncontrolled passion,
leading to defeat.

46:23.695 --> 46:25.996
Time to leave, I'd say.
Come on.

46:28.166 --> 46:29.700
It's so quiet.

46:32.070 --> 46:34.105
The bells have stopped.

46:36.075 --> 46:37.976
Mass has begun.

47:29.331 --> 47:31.532
Fuck.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.300
There's something I must do.

47:33.368 --> 47:36.270
- There's no time.
- The barge won't wait. Make a decision.

47:36.337 --> 47:39.239
The Book Of Leaves or whoever
tears you away. You can't have both.

47:39.307 --> 47:44.210
I can. I can, if you just find a way
to keep them here until I return.

47:44.278 --> 47:47.079
I'm not gonna be long.
Just stall them, Zo.

47:47.147 --> 47:48.347
Please!

47:52.919 --> 47:54.819
There's another meaning
to that card.

47:54.887 --> 47:56.688
A journey thwarted.

47:57.957 --> 48:03.128
In nominee Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

48:03.196 --> 48:05.664
- Amen.
-  Amen.

48:09.803 --> 48:12.873
Do you fear God, Signora?

48:14.008 --> 48:18.646
The wise...
both fear and love God.

48:18.714 --> 48:22.083
Why then do you hesitate
to enter His house?

48:22.150 --> 48:25.119
Because it isn't God who waits
for me inside those doors.

48:25.187 --> 48:28.723
..tui, cum oblationibus
hostiarum:

48:28.791 --> 48:32.260
ut paschalibus
initiata mysteriis,

48:32.328 --> 48:35.497
<i>ad aeternitatis</i>
<i>nobis medelam,</i>

48:35.564 --> 48:38.166
<i>te operante, proficiant.</i>

48:38.234 --> 48:41.503
<i>Per Dominum.</i>

48:41.570 --> 48:43.938
Riders approach.

48:44.006 --> 48:46.374
Two.

48:50.779 --> 48:52.713
Hell is descending
upon this city.

48:52.781 --> 48:55.650
Get yourself
to safety. Now.

49:57.513 --> 49:59.047
What has happened to you?

49:59.115 --> 50:00.549
God will permit no violence.

50:00.616 --> 50:02.851
You cannot disrupt
a sacred mass!

50:02.918 --> 50:05.053
- Sheathe your weapon!
- I'm sorry, but I cannot.

50:05.121 --> 50:08.857
Cease your intrusion.
This is a House of God.

50:08.925 --> 50:12.762
And God loves truth.
Let him speak.

50:12.830 --> 50:17.066
The Pazzis conspire
against us - my family!

50:17.134 --> 50:20.269
They're in league with Rome
and betray all Florence!

50:20.337 --> 50:24.206
People and Liberty!
Death to the Medicis!

50:32.781 --> 50:35.482
Go. Take our daughters
to safety.

50:35.550 --> 50:38.719
They'll have men at the
doors. Find a way out. Go!

50:40.321 --> 50:42.656
- Giuliano!
- Lorenzo!

50:49.731 --> 50:51.298
Towards the door.

50:57.273 --> 50:59.841
You betray our cause,
Captain.

50:59.909 --> 51:02.010
Your cause
betrays Florence.

51:09.452 --> 51:12.521
Flee, my lady! It is a chaos
of swords in there!

51:18.828 --> 51:21.963
Kill them!

51:30.639 --> 51:34.643
Brother! Brother!
Help your family!

51:35.512 --> 51:38.213
Rome is my family.

51:38.281 --> 51:40.015
Forgive me.

51:41.985 --> 51:45.120
- Aaargh!
- Giuliano!

51:47.857 --> 51:50.926
Die, Medici scum!

51:50.994 --> 51:53.896
The wife and children.
Go, go!

51:53.964 --> 51:56.866
Oh, Giuliano! Oh, no! No!

51:58.368 --> 51:59.835
No!

51:59.903 --> 52:01.771
Come on!

52:10.615 --> 52:12.216
Aaargh!

52:21.158 --> 52:24.027
Clarice...please!

52:24.095 --> 52:26.229
Come on.

52:29.801 --> 52:32.836
I'm...I'm dying, Vanessa.

52:32.904 --> 52:37.140
Your line will live on.
In me.

52:38.575 --> 52:42.979
I'm bearing your child,
your son, Giuliano.

52:49.320 --> 52:52.255
Vanessa, it's too late.
Vanessa, leave him.

52:52.323 --> 52:54.758
Leave him! Vanessa!

52:54.825 --> 52:58.695
- No! No!
- Yes. Come on.

53:00.998 --> 53:02.599
Stay with me.

53:07.204 --> 53:10.907
Drop it, dear cousin.

53:10.974 --> 53:14.410
No, no!

53:14.478 --> 53:17.714
You imagine I can't take on
the lot of you?

53:17.781 --> 53:19.783
Riario.

53:22.052 --> 53:26.656
If your true loyalty is to
the Medicis, Captain...

53:26.724 --> 53:30.526
..I suggest you take them away
and leave this one to me.

53:30.594 --> 53:33.830
- But Signora Donati...
- Has betrayed you for Rome.

53:33.898 --> 53:37.200
Leave them to each other,
Signora.

53:37.268 --> 53:40.470
Children.

53:40.538 --> 53:42.673
Hurry.

53:44.409 --> 53:47.011
No...

53:50.448 --> 53:53.017
I've prayed for this day.
Today, Florence rejoices.

53:53.084 --> 53:55.019
Are you certain of that, Pazzi?

54:06.665 --> 54:07.732
Aaargh!

54:13.105 --> 54:14.639
Before you die, Lorenzo,

54:14.706 --> 54:17.308
know that I'll kill every
last Medici in Florence.

54:17.376 --> 54:21.245
I'll wipe all evidence of your
family's existence from this world!

54:24.116 --> 54:25.883
Iron rusts from disuse.

54:41.566 --> 54:44.235
Let us finish off
the Medicis, scribbler,

54:44.303 --> 54:45.870
and we might let you live.

54:45.938 --> 54:49.607
A Florence ruled by Pazzis? No!

54:49.675 --> 54:52.743
No. I think I'd rather
go down fighting.

54:52.811 --> 54:54.011
As you wish.

55:04.622 --> 55:07.357
Come on. Come on!

55:08.892 --> 55:12.061
Come on! Come on!

55:20.469 --> 55:23.505
- That won't hold long.
- The doors will hold.

55:23.573 --> 55:27.075
Verrocchio designed
the locks.

55:30.714 --> 55:34.483
Giuliano?
Have I lost a brother?

55:37.487 --> 55:40.690
Come on! Come on, come on!

55:41.626 --> 55:43.059
Da Vinci!

55:43.127 --> 55:45.663
Upon my arrival
I saw only you.

55:49.267 --> 55:52.737
- I knew you wouldn't abandon us.
- Stop. Save your strength.

55:53.839 --> 55:55.807
Da Vinci!

56:00.646 --> 56:02.480
It'll be over soon, Lucrezia!

56:06.251 --> 56:10.488
I'm sorry, Leonardo. You've saved my
life, and I know what it's cost you...

56:10.556 --> 56:14.425
Ssh. Save your praise
for someone who deserves it.

56:14.493 --> 56:17.628
I wonder which of the two men you
fuck will be buried alongside you?

56:17.696 --> 56:20.598
You chose Florence
over your own dreams.

56:20.665 --> 56:22.666
You will accept my love.

56:22.734 --> 56:24.868
It is the least
I can offer you.

56:27.505 --> 56:31.942
This ring.
I know this ring.

56:35.213 --> 56:37.415
It's Lucrezia's.

56:41.820 --> 56:46.191
Are you fucking her...
or is it more?

56:48.961 --> 56:52.164
You better finish the job they
have begun or I swear...

56:52.231 --> 56:55.767
if we survive this,
I'll kill you both.

56:57.804 --> 57:01.107
God's vengeance
is upon you!
