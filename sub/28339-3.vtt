WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.860
- Barry.
- Am I evil?

00:02.880 --> 00:05.700
Oh, my God. I mean...

00:05.710 --> 00:07.950
absolutely. Do I not
tell you that enough?

00:09.220 --> 00:10.790
What the fuck you doing here, man?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.050
Did you kill a fuckin' cop?

00:12.060 --> 00:13.710
- Fuches, you gotta go.
- Huh? No, no, I could go to jail.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.890
I don't wanna see you again!

00:16.550 --> 00:19.420
- Hi, Dad.
- Were you planned? No.

00:19.430 --> 00:21.290
So I did what every great actor does.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.380
I improvised.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.470
You left.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.020
You wanna leave them
wanting more, not less.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.710
That troll Esther is pulling fast one.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.710
So we get in there, we shoot her

00:32.720 --> 00:35.190
in her crazy watermelon-sized head,

00:35.200 --> 00:37.090
massive fumble turnover for Hank.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.450
Ah, come... !

00:48.310 --> 00:51.790
And what of the future?
What does it hold?

00:51.800 --> 00:54.210
Thomas Friedman, let's start with you.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.500
The future of the world is
multinational alliances.

00:57.510 --> 00:59.970
And to thrive in this new economy,

00:59.980 --> 01:03.210
you are going to have to sacrifice
some of your sovereignty.

01:03.220 --> 01:06.870
But make no mistake,
Asia is on the rise.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.290
Bullshit.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.010
Who brought dum-dum over here?

01:10.020 --> 01:11.580
Asia is not on rise,

01:11.590 --> 01:15.030
because Hank has rock-solid
plan to stop Asia

01:15.040 --> 01:16.830
and restore natural order of business.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.850
Well, respectfully, I'm not sure that

01:19.860 --> 01:21.970
you're going to single-handedly stop

01:21.980 --> 01:25.030
the rise of Asia as a
global market force.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.560
Well, respectfully, why
don't you shut the fuck up?

01:27.570 --> 01:30.960
Because Asia will be done
the second I put a bullet

01:30.970 --> 01:33.959
in her massive, massive head.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.960
So, you know what, Thomas Friedman?

01:35.970 --> 01:38.969
You are bad at writing,
and nobody likes you.

01:38.970 --> 01:40.960
Hank.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.240
Hank!

01:45.810 --> 01:48.519
Jeez. What's up?

01:48.520 --> 01:51.140
Cristobal needs you.
Something has happened.

01:53.850 --> 01:57.439
You mean like... like something bad?

01:57.440 --> 02:00.520
Cristobal, what's up? Did
something happen to Esther?

02:02.930 --> 02:05.960
Holy shit. I guess not,

02:05.970 --> 02:07.620
because here she is.

02:07.630 --> 02:11.120
Esther and her men were
attacked last night.

02:11.130 --> 02:14.670
At the monastery? I imagine?

02:14.680 --> 02:19.610
Wow, what a dirtbag would
attack you at a holy place

02:19.620 --> 02:20.759
and fail?

02:20.760 --> 02:22.330
Thankfully.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.009
I mean, you look great.
With your Slurpee.

02:25.010 --> 02:27.809
I guess he, uh, didn't do his job.

02:27.810 --> 02:30.160
Or her job...

02:30.170 --> 02:32.190
Or maybe it was
coordinated drone attack?

02:32.200 --> 02:34.939
A white boy, in a Lululemon tracksuit.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.670
- Hmm.
- He ran away.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.899
Someone is trying to play with us, Hank.

02:39.900 --> 02:43.029
Someone is playing games.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.370
Games like the chess you showed me.

02:45.380 --> 02:46.909
Now I just have to figure out

02:46.910 --> 02:51.059
if it is a small piece or a big piece.

02:51.060 --> 02:53.000
Hmm.

02:53.010 --> 02:54.930
Maybe the horsey.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.710
Maybe the horsey.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.799
Hank, I don't think it is safe for her

02:59.800 --> 03:01.370
to stay at the monastery.

03:01.380 --> 03:04.430
I have invited Esther, and
some of her men to stay here,

03:04.440 --> 03:05.630
with us.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.290
So you and your men will have
to make some room for them.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.790
So then, where are we supposed to stay?

03:19.490 --> 03:22.819
Akhmal, we have work to do.

03:22.820 --> 03:25.920
Should we go to Ikea?
Get area rug, maybe?

03:25.930 --> 03:27.980
Couple beanbag chairs?

03:29.260 --> 03:31.370
We have to kill Barry.

03:41.590 --> 03:46.270
This is the story of the
first time I took a life.

03:46.280 --> 03:50.530
I was at an OP with my
best friend, Albert.

03:51.630 --> 03:54.780
We had seen some suspicious activity,

03:54.790 --> 03:57.870
and Albert told me to take the shot.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.139
I did.

04:00.140 --> 04:04.660
And it was the first time I
ever felt a sense of purpose,

04:04.670 --> 04:06.610
a sense of community.

04:08.680 --> 04:12.319
First time I killed someone, it
was the best day of my li...

04:12.320 --> 04:14.570
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:14.580 --> 04:15.990
Fuck.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.470
Are you struggling with your piece?

04:17.480 --> 04:19.410
Anything I can help with?

04:19.420 --> 04:22.029
Yeah, I just don't
know if I wanna do it.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.040
What? Why?

04:24.050 --> 04:26.330
It was really powerful. I mean, it was

04:26.340 --> 04:27.880
literally about life and death.

04:27.890 --> 04:30.320
No, I know it's about
life and death, but...

04:30.330 --> 04:32.280
I don't know, I did a lot over there.

04:32.290 --> 04:35.049
It wasn't all just... this stuff.

04:35.050 --> 04:37.180
Listen, I know better than anybody

04:37.190 --> 04:39.120
how scary it is to confront the past.

04:39.130 --> 04:41.120
I mean, you know, when Gene pushed me

04:41.130 --> 04:42.740
to talk about my marriage, you saw me.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.059
It totally freaked me out.

04:45.060 --> 04:48.620
Honestly, it's... it's
kind of been therapeutic.

04:48.630 --> 04:51.160
Like, okay, I just wrote the part

04:51.170 --> 04:52.870
where I finally stood
up to him and left him.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.450
And I... Okay.

04:55.220 --> 04:57.950
But listen to this.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.620
You just put your hands on
me for the last time, Sam.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.950
You wanna choke me? Well, choke on this.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.010
I'm fucking leaving you.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.419
He choked you?

05:07.420 --> 05:09.959
Oh, yeah. I mean, he was
a total piece of shit.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.420
I'm actually supposed to
Skype with my friend Kate

05:12.430 --> 05:13.620
who was there the night I left him.

05:13.630 --> 05:15.230
So the Wi-Fi is better in
your living room, yeah?

05:15.240 --> 05:16.440
- Yeah.
- Yeah, great.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.800
You might wanna make sure
Nick's dressed, though.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.240
- Yeah.
- And... Okay.

05:22.980 --> 05:26.720
Leo, are you there?

05:27.980 --> 05:30.360
- Come on. What is this?
- I know, I know, I know.

05:30.370 --> 05:32.410
It looks a little Mark David Chapman,

05:32.420 --> 05:34.360
but here's the real reason I'm here.

05:34.370 --> 05:37.840
I'm so sorry about how our
last conversation ended,

05:37.850 --> 05:39.620
and I wanted to make it up to you,

05:39.630 --> 05:42.239
so I brought you something.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.090
Ta-da!

05:45.050 --> 05:46.840
Open it.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.600
- What is this?
- That is the key

05:50.610 --> 05:52.370
to my cabin. I want you to have it.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.320
I want to keep it in the family.

05:54.330 --> 05:55.790
No strings attached.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.880
I... don't need a vacation home.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.509
No, see, there's the rub. I don't
see it as a vacation home.

06:00.510 --> 06:03.110
I see it as a business opportunity

06:03.120 --> 06:04.540
where you and I work together,

06:04.550 --> 06:07.719
and it can really bring us closer.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.109
You can maintain it, you can
show it, you can rent it.

06:11.110 --> 06:12.700
You want me to be your groundskeeper?

06:12.710 --> 06:16.109
I like to think of it more
as assistant to the owner.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.860
- Okay.
- Now,

06:17.890 --> 06:20.560
- I can't give you a wage, obviously.
- Dad.

06:20.570 --> 06:22.500
- But we can share the proceeds.
- Dad! Dad, I don't want the cabin

06:22.510 --> 06:24.390
where your girlfriend was
murdered. That's sick!

06:26.320 --> 06:28.320
Just please... just please go away.

06:28.330 --> 06:30.130
Please, Dad. Please, please.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.280
Please leave me alone.

06:37.820 --> 06:40.340
So Mark is Hayden's baseball coach,

06:40.350 --> 06:42.130
and he's taking it so damn seriously.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.579
He's kind of taking out all
of his aggression on Hayden

06:44.580 --> 06:46.540
even though he wasn't even
a good baseball player

06:46.550 --> 06:48.640
- if you remember in high school.
- No, he was shit.

06:48.650 --> 06:50.140
Oh, and he's chewing tobacco now

06:50.150 --> 06:52.419
- which is so vile. I'm dying.
- Ew.

06:52.420 --> 06:54.800
- Tell him I say hi, though.
- I will.

06:54.810 --> 06:58.080
Um, okay, so I started writing.

06:58.090 --> 06:59.430
- Wow!
- Yeah.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.429
I mean, everybody writes their
own material these days, so...

07:02.430 --> 07:05.760
Um, and I decided I'm gonna
write a scene about Sam.

07:05.770 --> 07:08.260
Okay.

07:08.270 --> 07:09.860
- Why?
- I mean specifically

07:09.870 --> 07:10.870
about the night that I left.

07:10.880 --> 07:11.979
So do you remember that night?

07:11.980 --> 07:14.130
Um...

07:14.140 --> 07:18.020
Yeah, unfortunately I remember
that night really well.

07:18.030 --> 07:20.640
Yeah, I know. Sorry that we never
really, like, talked about it.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.540
Um, but this is really important.

07:22.550 --> 07:24.590
It's for this acting
class, and I just, I...

07:24.600 --> 07:28.110
I need to know like what you
remember about that last night.

07:28.140 --> 07:31.999
I remember that you came over
in the middle of the night,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.570
and you had the welts on your neck.

07:35.070 --> 07:36.999
And you were a mess.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.589
You said that you had been

07:39.590 --> 07:42.380
at the Rooster earlier,
dancing with Ken Singleton,

07:42.390 --> 07:44.240
and then Sam flipped out about it.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.970
- Yeah.
- So then when you got home,

07:46.980 --> 07:48.210
he beat you up.

07:48.940 --> 07:52.180
So we decided that you
needed to get out of there.

07:52.190 --> 07:53.980
And we headed over to your place,

07:53.990 --> 07:56.520
and I grabbed a baseball bat,

07:56.530 --> 07:58.229
like that's gonna do any good.

07:58.230 --> 07:59.800
And when we got there, he was

07:59.810 --> 08:01.489
passed out on the floor as usual.

08:01.490 --> 08:02.920
So we just grabbed a whole
bunch of your stuff,

08:02.930 --> 08:05.730
we just threw it in the
car, and you took off.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.749
Yeah, right, but that was
after I told him to fuck off.

08:10.750 --> 08:14.459
Oh. I don't... I don't
really remember that.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.890
No, I said... I said, "You
wanna choke me, you coward?

08:16.900 --> 08:19.270
Well, choke on this. I'm out of here."

08:19.980 --> 08:21.210
- Wow!
- Yeah.

08:21.220 --> 08:23.730
I told you this at the time.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.430
Well, it was a long time ago.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.010
- And... and it was a crazy night.
- Yeah.

08:30.020 --> 08:32.240
And... We shouldn't talk about that.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.360
We should talk about all the good things

08:33.370 --> 08:35.150
- that are happening for you.
- Yeah.

08:35.159 --> 08:38.559
Mark and I, we watched you
when you played the alien mom.

08:38.570 --> 08:40.649
- Oh, God, how crazy was that makeup?
- That was so good.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.580
Did you guys see this other show I did?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.239
It was called Pompeii's Burning.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.340
No, I don't think I've seen that. I...

08:46.350 --> 08:48.260
To be honest, I'm so busy with the kids,

08:48.270 --> 08:50.320
- I don't really have time to watch much.
- Oh, right.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.200
Except for Grey's Anatomy, Kardashians,

08:53.210 --> 08:55.829
all the Desperate
Housewives, This Is Us,

08:55.830 --> 08:58.520
So You Think You Can Dance?, The Voice.

08:58.530 --> 08:59.980
I love the Switched at Birth.

08:59.990 --> 09:02.060
I like that one with the
family with all the kids.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.080
That's a good one.

09:16.610 --> 09:19.970
This is not the story of the
first time I took a life,

09:19.980 --> 09:22.390
but the first time I saved a life.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.870
It was my second deployment.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.800
We were in the Korengal Valley.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.840
A villager's donkey had been killed,

09:28.850 --> 09:30.540
and Albert and I were trying to settle

09:30.550 --> 09:33.010
a dispute over who was responsible.

09:33.020 --> 09:36.130
Okay, anybody here shoot a donkey?

09:36.140 --> 09:37.720
Right, I didn't think so.

09:37.730 --> 09:40.220
Look, I understand that you're
upset about your donkey,

09:40.230 --> 09:41.300
but no one here shot it,

09:41.310 --> 09:42.910
so we're not gonna
compensate you for it.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.349
Talk to me, talk to me.
He can talk to me.

09:51.350 --> 09:52.820
- He said God is watching you.
- God is watching me?

09:52.830 --> 09:54.670
Well, then God knows that I...

09:58.940 --> 10:00.090
Corpsman!

10:03.550 --> 10:06.529
Corpsman. Corpsman!

10:06.530 --> 10:08.260
Corpsman, flank!

10:08.270 --> 10:10.210
Corpsman!

10:13.870 --> 10:16.789
Do you see 'em?!

10:16.790 --> 10:19.090
- No. No, Albert!
- Watch your ten!

10:19.100 --> 10:20.249
Watch your four to five!

10:32.650 --> 10:36.300
Hey, you!

10:36.310 --> 10:39.970
No, no, no, no, no...

10:39.980 --> 10:41.860
Fuck.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.130
How the fuck did you miss?

11:14.140 --> 11:15.509
I don't know how to shoot gun!

11:15.510 --> 11:16.840
Hey, you know this about yourself,

11:16.850 --> 11:19.340
yet when I ask you to come
kill Barry, you say okay?

11:19.350 --> 11:21.720
Hank, there is a power dynamic
here which prevents me...

11:22.830 --> 11:24.890
Get down!

11:24.900 --> 11:27.220
- What happened?
- I got fucking shot!

11:27.230 --> 11:29.550
- Shit.
- Ow, my fucking arm!

11:29.560 --> 11:31.500
Aah! It's so painful!

11:31.510 --> 11:33.620
I did a table read with
Wilmer Valderrama.

11:33.630 --> 11:35.840
You know him. He's a lot of fun.

11:35.850 --> 11:37.440
He's really... loose.

11:37.450 --> 11:40.440
- Fez? Yeah!
- Yeah, Fez! Yeah.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.720
Okay, Akhmal, you got to
get your shit together,

11:42.730 --> 11:44.050
just stand up there, and shoot him.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.440
- Okay? Believe in yourself!
- Fuck you!

11:45.450 --> 11:46.760
I... I just got shot!

11:46.770 --> 11:48.280
Well, I got shot too, remember?

11:48.290 --> 11:50.420
Barry shot me like
precisely in same arm.

11:50.430 --> 11:52.629
Oh, same spot! Wow, he's so good!

11:52.630 --> 11:54.240
All right, but I wasn't a baby about it,

11:54.250 --> 11:55.250
was I? Come on!

11:55.260 --> 11:58.099
Get up, Hank. Get up.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.550
You fucking nuts?

11:59.560 --> 12:01.990
Taking shots at me? My fucking
girlfriend's in there!

12:04.610 --> 12:06.439
You fucked our plan.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.790
I'm dead man anyway, so you know what?

12:10.610 --> 12:12.780
Just do it.

12:15.780 --> 12:17.780
Do it.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.409
Fuck!

12:22.410 --> 12:24.430
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck!

12:24.440 --> 12:26.430
Oh, my God, that was so scary!

12:26.440 --> 12:28.610
That was really scary.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.760
- Hank, listen to me. We can't...
- Oh, no.

12:34.770 --> 12:36.679
Come on, man. Hank.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.160
Oh, my God.

12:39.170 --> 12:41.170
Oh, my God!

12:41.990 --> 12:43.659
I vomited.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.189
I'm sorry. Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

12:46.190 --> 12:47.200
- All right, listen.
- That was so gross.

12:47.210 --> 12:48.860
I can't work for you anymore, all right?

12:48.870 --> 12:50.370
You gotta find someone else.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.760
Well, do you know any other assassins?

12:51.770 --> 12:52.780
No.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.940
Well, what do you want me to do?
Go to John Wick Assassin Hotel

12:54.950 --> 12:56.310
with help wanted sign? I mean what?

12:56.320 --> 12:57.790
You got good guys right here, man.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.930
Oh, my God, my guys
suck balls! You know it!

12:59.940 --> 13:02.140
Especially this motherfucker right here!

13:02.150 --> 13:04.740
If I suck balls, you are
king of Suck Balls Mountain!

13:04.750 --> 13:07.510
Oh, shut the fuck up!

13:07.520 --> 13:09.820
- Fuck you!
- Shut up.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.360
Look, what if, uh...

13:14.320 --> 13:16.020
What if I train your guys?

13:16.030 --> 13:17.890
They already have physical
trainer. They have like three.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.390
Not at a gym. I'm talking about...

13:19.400 --> 13:21.260
I'm a Marine, all right?

13:21.270 --> 13:24.429
I can teach them how to
shoot, combat skills.

13:24.430 --> 13:27.240
I don't have to kill anymore, debt paid.

13:28.990 --> 13:30.829
You give me army?

13:30.830 --> 13:33.890
You turn these pumpkins into
Cinderellas overnight, huh?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.800
Phew. We could take over Burmese mafia,

13:35.810 --> 13:37.660
go back to fifty-fifty with Cristobal.

13:37.670 --> 13:39.090
Or you could just take the
whole thing for yourself.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.200
Fifty-fifty with Cristobal.
I like the sound of that.

13:42.210 --> 13:44.460
Look, I need some gear
from you, all right?

13:44.470 --> 13:46.820
I'll send you a list of
things I'm gonna need

13:46.830 --> 13:47.860
if we're gonna do this, all right?

13:47.870 --> 13:50.080
And we've gotta go out someplace far.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.260
Like the desert or some...
what are you doing?

13:52.270 --> 13:53.379
Fifty-fifty...

13:53.380 --> 13:54.760
Hank.

13:54.770 --> 13:56.570
... with Cristobal.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.800
What are you doing?

14:00.810 --> 14:03.370
What are you doing?

14:03.410 --> 14:04.860
Come on, get up!

14:04.870 --> 14:06.390
We can't talk to each
other on the phone.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.900
♪ Fifty-fifty with Cristobal! ♪

14:09.280 --> 14:12.980
- People are looking at us.
- ♪ Fifty-fifty with Cristobal! ♪

14:12.990 --> 14:15.970
- ♪ And Barry's training me an army! ♪
- Hank. Hank! Stop!

14:29.900 --> 14:31.579
Oh, my God!

14:31.580 --> 14:34.720
- That was intense.
- Mm-hmm?

14:34.730 --> 14:36.840
Yeah, I was just on the
phone with my friend Kate

14:36.850 --> 14:39.920
for like an hour rehashing some
really difficult memories.

14:39.930 --> 14:41.960
Wait, it was super helpful,
though, to talk someone

14:41.970 --> 14:43.720
who was actually there, you know,

14:43.730 --> 14:45.080
just to get like a reality check.

14:45.090 --> 14:46.780
That's great.

14:47.110 --> 14:52.050
I feel like if I'm gonna
tell this story, I just...

14:52.060 --> 14:56.069
I have to do it a hundred
percent honestly, you know?

14:56.070 --> 14:59.010
And she basically remembers
it exactly the same way I do.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.610
Good.

15:02.740 --> 15:04.720
- Aw, you seem tense.
- Yeah?

15:04.730 --> 15:07.580
Yeah, don't worry. Look, it's
just a bit of writer's block.

15:07.590 --> 15:10.280
Okay? It happens to everybody.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.970
Who can you talk to to
help with your story?

15:13.980 --> 15:15.470
Um...

15:15.480 --> 15:18.500
What about the Marines that you
brought to Natalie's party?

15:19.940 --> 15:21.780
They don't really talk anymore.

15:21.790 --> 15:22.799
Oh.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.520
Well, there has to be
someone you can talk to

15:25.530 --> 15:26.840
about what you went through.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.620
You listen to me, Barry, you dumb fuck!

15:34.630 --> 15:37.360
I want you to admit it. You
killed Detective Janice Moss.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.640
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

15:38.650 --> 15:41.030
No, I didn't, you little piece of shit.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.090
- Is that necessary?
- Just go. Just do it again.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.490
Okay!

15:45.110 --> 15:48.090
Barry, I know you killed
Detective Janice Moss.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.699
- How?
- Because I was there.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.329
- You were?
- No.

15:52.330 --> 15:53.970
Well, I think he would know that.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.459
We don't know what he knows.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.420
Why don't you just let
me go talk to him, huh?

15:58.430 --> 16:01.160
I built this guy's mind. You
don't think I can tear it apart?

16:01.170 --> 16:03.130
Just give me five minutes with him!

16:03.140 --> 16:04.660
I'll have him shitting in my hand.

16:04.670 --> 16:07.260
- What? Wha... ?
- Mm-hmm.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.400
- You better make it work.
- Or I'll go to jail.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.590
- Yeah. Jail.
- Okay. I hear you.

16:16.030 --> 16:18.649
What the fuck is this place?

16:18.650 --> 16:24.550
This is a quinceañera store
which I bought for my wife,

16:24.560 --> 16:26.640
who then left me.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.130
So she's not my wife anymore, is she?

16:29.140 --> 16:31.070
Thanks for bringing that up.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.660
This quinceañera stuff,

16:33.670 --> 16:35.340
it's a really big deal
for these young ladies.

16:35.350 --> 16:38.670
Sort of like a female bar mitzvah.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.089
All right, listen up, you clowns.

16:43.090 --> 16:44.990
I'm just kidding. You guys look great.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.969
So, we are super lucky today
to begin exciting new project,

16:49.970 --> 16:51.180
learning all styles of combat

16:51.190 --> 16:53.180
from our very skilled special guest.

16:53.190 --> 16:56.520
He's your teacher, but he's
my best friend: Barry.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.510
Before we get started, does
anybody have any questions?

17:13.900 --> 17:16.619
Is it true you are the
most gifted assassin

17:16.630 --> 17:17.630
in all of America?

17:17.640 --> 17:20.800
No, I'm not the most gifted
assassin in all of America.

17:23.030 --> 17:25.628
He is being modest. He is
Air Jordan of assassins.

17:32.490 --> 17:35.130
We're all very excited
to be learning from you.

17:35.140 --> 17:36.809
Will we be shooting guns today?

17:36.810 --> 17:38.570
Yeah...

17:39.280 --> 17:41.490
Wait, how many of you
guys speak English?

17:43.490 --> 17:44.689
Okay, bounce.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.800
Come on, bounce. Get out.

17:46.810 --> 17:49.409
Go on, take a break. Walk.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.470
_

18:10.250 --> 18:11.990
_

18:14.150 --> 18:15.760
Oh, man!

18:15.770 --> 18:17.760
These guys are like a
Seal Team Six, huh?

18:17.770 --> 18:19.849
Maybe even like seven and a half!

18:19.850 --> 18:22.650
Natural born killers, huh?

18:23.030 --> 18:24.279
For reals though,

18:24.280 --> 18:27.609
how long until they
become like actual army?

18:27.610 --> 18:30.739
You know, like two, three hours?

18:30.740 --> 18:32.940
Hank, I can't magically wave a wand

18:32.950 --> 18:35.700
and make these guys an army.
Their skill set sucks.

18:35.710 --> 18:38.250
Well, you know what Sonny
and Cher would say,

18:38.270 --> 18:39.450
that's on you, babe.

18:39.470 --> 18:41.920
So come on, let's kick
up the training a notch.

18:41.930 --> 18:43.030
What do you think?

18:44.010 --> 18:45.070
Whoa.

18:48.070 --> 18:49.800
Holy shit, Mayrbek.

18:49.810 --> 18:52.800
You're like regular Annie Oakley.

18:52.810 --> 18:54.050
Nice!

18:55.640 --> 18:57.360
Annie Oakley.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.650
Hey, boss! Did you see?

19:01.910 --> 19:03.720
Good, good, good.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.310
Good job, man!

19:07.650 --> 19:09.250
_

19:09.270 --> 19:13.190
_

19:15.670 --> 19:18.430
_

19:21.080 --> 19:24.340
Sorry, we're closed.

19:24.350 --> 19:27.060
So this is how you're
earning a buck now, huh?

19:27.070 --> 19:30.259
Selling sports bras? What
the fuck happened to you?

19:30.260 --> 19:31.680
Fuches, listen...

19:31.690 --> 19:34.469
No, you listen to me, you
ungrateful piece of shit. I...

19:34.470 --> 19:36.530
I'm really glad you're here.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.720
Really?

19:40.730 --> 19:42.640
Korengal, man? You
really wanna talk about

19:42.650 --> 19:44.479
what happened in Korengal? Why?

19:44.480 --> 19:48.010
Well, they wanted me to talk
about my first confirmed,

19:48.020 --> 19:50.220
and I want to do
something more positive.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.790
So I was gonna talk about
when I saved Albert,

19:53.800 --> 19:54.820
but that story...

19:54.830 --> 19:56.900
That story gets fucked up really fast.

19:56.910 --> 19:58.320
- Yeah.
- That's literally the worst story

19:58.330 --> 19:59.490
you could tell.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.240
I mean, after everything we
did to make that go away,

20:02.250 --> 20:04.280
you want to start fucking
blab about that?

20:04.290 --> 20:06.540
- Well, it has to be honest. That's why...
- Honest?

20:06.550 --> 20:08.010
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

20:08.020 --> 20:09.800
You start telling the
truth about Korengal

20:09.810 --> 20:11.510
to those little acting buddies of yours,

20:11.520 --> 20:14.510
and they are never gonna look
at you the same way again.

20:15.940 --> 20:18.220
Come on, man. You're in show business.

20:18.230 --> 20:21.370
They don't want honest,
they want entertainment.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.520
I mean, Jesus, you think
that the real guy

20:23.530 --> 20:26.050
did that speech in Braveheart? No!

20:26.060 --> 20:27.880
No, he went and got
himself killed, you know?

20:27.890 --> 20:30.130
But that's not a story,
that's a situation.

20:30.140 --> 20:32.190
So you gotta have him do the speech,

20:32.200 --> 20:34.010
you know, so everybody can say, "Oh,

20:34.030 --> 20:36.620
he died for something."

20:43.460 --> 20:45.010
Hey.

20:45.020 --> 20:47.630
What's the matter with you, man? What?

20:48.460 --> 20:51.200
Nothing. It's just, this is...

20:51.990 --> 20:53.469
I...

20:53.470 --> 20:55.260
I don't have this, you know?

20:55.270 --> 20:57.930
Like, everyone in class, they have this.

20:57.940 --> 21:01.090
It's like, Sally, she has
a friend that, you know,

21:01.100 --> 21:03.020
she told her story to, and, you know,

21:03.030 --> 21:04.580
it was really helpful she said,

21:04.590 --> 21:06.130
because it was someone who was there.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.700
Yeah.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.490
Kind of someone who cared.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.130
I don't know, I just can't talk
about this shit with anybody...

21:17.140 --> 21:18.930
Just shut up, man.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.290
Just, you know...

21:24.320 --> 21:26.290
I missed you, man.

21:27.860 --> 21:30.880
I did. I know that sounds...
We can talk about other shit.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.470
I fucking miss you so much.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.300
- Oh, okay.
- Get in here.

21:34.310 --> 21:37.800
You don't think I fucking missed you?

21:37.810 --> 21:40.349
- You're my boy. I got you.
- Yeah.

21:40.350 --> 21:43.130
- I love you, man.
- Thanks, Fuches.

21:43.140 --> 21:45.350
- I really miss you, man.
- I miss you, too, man.

21:50.860 --> 21:55.359
Okay, so this is the true story

21:55.360 --> 21:57.900
of the moment that changed my life.

21:58.740 --> 22:02.470
We were on patrol in
the Korengal Valley.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.659
Albert had been shot in the face,

22:04.660 --> 22:06.220
and I was giving him first aid.

22:06.230 --> 22:10.020
And then something interesting happened.

22:10.030 --> 22:12.270
Barry, we've gotta leave
him! We've gotta go!

22:13.200 --> 22:14.640
Go?

22:14.650 --> 22:16.670
Go?!

22:18.400 --> 22:20.050
Listen to me.

22:20.060 --> 22:23.130
Run and live, at least for a while.

22:23.140 --> 22:26.750
And dying in your beds
many years from now,

22:26.760 --> 22:30.180
would you be willing
to trade all the days,

22:30.190 --> 22:31.820
from this day to that,

22:31.830 --> 22:35.609
for one chance, just one chance,

22:35.610 --> 22:38.080
to come back here and
tell our enemies...

22:38.090 --> 22:41.449
... that they may take our
lives, but they will never take

22:41.450 --> 22:44.280
- our freedom...
- Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:44.290 --> 22:45.560
- Yeah?
- That's Braveheart.

22:45.570 --> 22:47.560
- No, it's not.
- That's definitely Braveheart.

22:47.570 --> 22:49.700
I know this, 'cause I chased
that movie for months.

22:49.710 --> 22:51.760
- Huh?
- I know I knew that from somewhere.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.190
No. No, you don't.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.960
- I said that in Afghanistan.
- Dude, that was definitely Braveheart.

22:54.990 --> 22:57.240
- That's like my favorite movie.
- I said...

22:57.250 --> 22:59.090
Where is the sheep-fucker story?

22:59.100 --> 23:00.380
How do you go away from that?

23:01.280 --> 23:04.389
I just I wanna do something
inspirational and entertaining.

23:04.390 --> 23:07.050
So you thought you would
plagiarize Mel Gibson.

23:07.060 --> 23:09.389
I'm Jewish! What the fuck, Barry?

23:09.390 --> 23:11.660
You were in a war,

23:11.670 --> 23:14.380
and you give us pizzi-caca.

23:14.390 --> 23:17.400
You have got to get in touch
with your inherent darkness.

23:17.410 --> 23:19.860
- It's not inherent.
- Trust me, that is exactly what it is,

23:19.870 --> 23:20.870
and it is dark.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.590
And you better funnel it into your work,

23:23.600 --> 23:25.610
or there is the damn door.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.930
Okay, you know what? I've got an idea.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.890
- Sally...
- Yes?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.209
Have you settled on
someone to play your ex?

23:33.210 --> 23:36.540
- Yeah, uh, Nick's doing it.
- Yo.

23:36.550 --> 23:37.830
Is that firm?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.500
- Yes, yes.
- I don't know.

23:39.510 --> 23:41.160
Okay, Barry's gonna play your ex.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.490
Settled. Next.

23:42.950 --> 23:44.680
Don't think I can play straight?

23:44.690 --> 23:47.030
I played straight for
22 damn years, okay?

23:51.830 --> 23:54.110
All right, um...

23:54.820 --> 23:56.770
Are you sure you're
comfortable with this?

23:56.780 --> 23:59.480
Oh, my God, totally. Barry, you're
nothing like Sam like at all.

23:59.490 --> 24:01.220
If anything, I'm more
comfortable with you doing it.

24:01.230 --> 24:03.180
Hey, this is a really
good stretch for you.

24:03.190 --> 24:05.160
Try to access some rage, you know?

24:06.530 --> 24:08.090
Okay?

24:08.100 --> 24:10.990
- Where do you want me to start?
- Oh, sorry. Top of two.

24:14.290 --> 24:15.640
Why were you dancing with that guy?

24:15.650 --> 24:17.470
Ken?

24:17.480 --> 24:19.570
He's just a friend, Sam.

24:21.280 --> 24:24.300
I don't care, I don't like it.
It was embarrassing.

24:25.690 --> 24:27.040
You look like a whore.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.100
Can you try it again

24:28.110 --> 24:30.020
and just like really nail
me with the word "whore"?

24:30.030 --> 24:31.970
Really just come at me, you know?

24:31.980 --> 24:33.820
Okay.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.320
I don't care, I don't like it.
It was embarrassing.

24:38.330 --> 24:40.640
- You looked like a whore.
- Sam...

24:40.650 --> 24:43.860
- don't be an idiot.
- Don't call me a fucking idiot.

24:47.830 --> 24:49.490
I'm sorry, I don't think I can do this.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.120
- Why?
- This says I choke her.

24:51.130 --> 24:52.130
- It says I choke you.
- Mm-hmm.

24:52.140 --> 24:54.340
I don't know if I can do that.
I don't think I can choke you.

24:54.350 --> 24:56.240
Oh, that's really sweet, Barry,

24:56.250 --> 24:58.470
but I've done like years of
stage combat. It's fine.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.460
You know what? That is so sweet,

25:00.470 --> 25:02.800
but what you need to do if
you're gonna be in the scene,

25:02.810 --> 25:03.810
is you need to act.

25:03.820 --> 25:06.860
I need to see you acting.

25:07.530 --> 25:09.680
Yeah, if you don't choke me,

25:09.690 --> 25:11.670
then it doesn't make sense when I say,

25:11.680 --> 25:13.620
"You wanna choke me, you
coward? Well, choke on this.

25:13.630 --> 25:15.300
I'm fucking leaving you!" So...

25:15.310 --> 25:17.689
All right, action!

25:17.690 --> 25:21.280
Okay. Hey, you can do it.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.489
- Why were you dancing with that guy?
- Ken?

25:26.490 --> 25:28.420
He's just a friend, Sam.

25:28.430 --> 25:30.140
I don't care, I don't like it.
It was embarrassing.

25:30.150 --> 25:32.160
- You look like a whore.
- Sam...

25:32.170 --> 25:34.510
- don't be an idiot.
- Don't call me a fucking idiot!

25:34.520 --> 25:35.999
Sam...

25:36.000 --> 25:38.260
Don't be an idiot!

25:38.270 --> 25:40.340
Come on. Hey.

25:40.350 --> 25:41.720
Come on.

25:41.730 --> 25:43.370
- Sally, I can't choke you.
- Hey, Barry, come on.

25:43.380 --> 25:44.460
- No, just come on.
- It's just one thing...

25:44.470 --> 25:45.900
Come on!

25:45.910 --> 25:47.839
Don't do that. Please, Sally.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.110
It's just something
I'm not capable of...

25:51.390 --> 25:53.340
Come on, you baby.

25:53.350 --> 25:54.769
Hey!

25:54.770 --> 25:56.300
- Don't say that.
- Come on!

25:56.310 --> 25:57.840
What are you doing? Don't do that.

25:57.850 --> 25:59.769
- Come on! Come on!
- Look, Sally...

25:59.770 --> 26:01.720
- Look, I know who you really are, okay?
- Don't touch me!

26:01.730 --> 26:03.490
- You pretend to be this nice guy...
- Stop it. Stop it!

26:03.500 --> 26:05.160
- ... but deep down... you're nothing but rotten...
- Stop!

26:05.170 --> 26:06.540
- ... and you like it.
- What is wrong with you?

26:06.550 --> 26:08.050
That's why you're never gonna change

26:08.060 --> 26:10.390
and that's why I'm gonna
fucking leave you!

26:10.400 --> 26:12.940
- Why are you saying that stuff to me?
- Come on! Come on!

26:12.950 --> 26:14.699
- Stop saying that.
- Fucking choke me!

26:14.700 --> 26:16.240
Fucking do it, you fucking pussy!

26:16.250 --> 26:18.180
- Fucking do it! Come on!
- Barry, she's helping you.

26:18.190 --> 26:20.930
- Come on! Choke me!
- Stay in the scene with her. Let it out.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.420
Fuck off!

26:24.110 --> 26:25.130
Shit.

26:25.140 --> 26:27.370
Hey, Barry, hey!

26:30.700 --> 26:34.250
Hey. Hey! Barry, wait! I'm sorry. Look,

26:34.270 --> 26:36.570
I took it too far, I know. I was
trying to help you with the scene.

26:36.580 --> 26:38.209
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Look, look, I don't know why everybody

26:38.210 --> 26:39.300
wants me to do this, okay?

26:39.310 --> 26:41.050
- I don't want to hurt anybody!
- I know!

26:41.060 --> 26:43.010
I get it. You don't have to
hurt me, it's just acting.

26:43.030 --> 26:45.440
It's just part of the scene,
okay? It was only to...

26:46.070 --> 26:47.820
What?

26:49.240 --> 26:51.070
Hey, Sally.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.620
Hey, Sam.

28:33.830 --> 28:36.920
You don't think all this
Spy Game stuff is overkill?

28:36.930 --> 28:40.270
No. Just get him here, get him talking,

28:40.280 --> 28:41.560
and I'll do the rest.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.189
You just hit me for the last time, Sam.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.260
Hey, Sally said she didn't
want you seeing that.

28:46.270 --> 28:47.890
No you said you didn't
want me to see it.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.130
Sally, what's wrong?

28:49.140 --> 28:50.720
How do I explain to people the beatings

28:50.730 --> 28:53.470
- and apologies?
- You don't have to.

28:54.570 --> 28:58.180
Your story is that your
father was abducted

28:58.190 --> 29:00.310
and replaced by aliens?

29:00.320 --> 29:02.110
That's what happened.

29:02.570 --> 29:04.579
I'm having a little trouble with that.

29:09.490 --> 29:12.950
It's the first time I ever
felt a sense of purpose.

29:13.650 --> 29:15.380
A sense of community.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.480
First time I killed someone
was the best day of my li...

29:19.490 --> 29:21.490
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:22.650 --> 29:25.059
We had this idea of, you know,

29:25.060 --> 29:26.840
this thing from your
past that you don't like

29:26.850 --> 29:29.040
and how you rewrite it in your head.

29:29.050 --> 29:32.090
And Barry does that and we
kind of illustrate this

29:32.100 --> 29:34.220
in this way of showing
the same flashback

29:34.230 --> 29:35.630
over and over again.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.890
This is not the story

29:36.910 --> 29:38.690
of the first time I took a life,

29:38.700 --> 29:40.949
but the first time I saved a life.

29:40.950 --> 29:41.980
He wants to tell a nice story

29:41.990 --> 29:43.920
'cause the first story was so terrible,

29:43.930 --> 29:46.130
and it just gets a little
bit more ridiculous

29:46.140 --> 29:48.360
as he's trying to navigate.

29:48.370 --> 29:51.130
Okay, so this is the true story

29:51.140 --> 29:53.020
of the moment that changed my life.

29:53.030 --> 29:54.460
It's an interesting
thing in human nature

29:54.470 --> 29:58.030
that you rewrite your memories
to favor what you want to be

29:58.050 --> 30:00.139
as opposed to what you really are.

30:00.140 --> 30:03.810
You were in a war, and
you give us pizzi-caca!

30:03.820 --> 30:06.390
The same with Barry, the
same with Cousineau,

30:06.400 --> 30:09.200
the Sally character is
dealing with her past.

30:09.210 --> 30:11.860
We find out about her ex-husband, Sam.

30:11.870 --> 30:12.870
He choked you?

30:12.880 --> 30:15.480
Oh, yeah, I mean, he was
a total piece of shit.

30:15.490 --> 30:17.740
She Facetimed her friend
to get the real story,

30:17.750 --> 30:21.310
but it's just validation for
her version of the story.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.100
She's trying to sort of author the truth

30:24.110 --> 30:25.420
- in that scene where she's like...
- Yeah.

30:25.430 --> 30:27.500
"Right, remember and then
this happened. Remember?"

30:27.510 --> 30:30.079
Yeah, right, but that was
after I told him to fuck off.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.980
Same as Barry, like they're
both doing the same thing...

30:32.990 --> 30:34.820
- Yeah.
- ... which is that idea of like,

30:34.830 --> 30:36.920
"I'm gonna tell my truth,
but it's the version

30:36.930 --> 30:39.420
of the truth that I
feel the best about."

30:39.430 --> 30:40.800
- You know?
- Right.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.840
When we shot on that
roof, it was like...

30:43.850 --> 30:46.639
- A hundred degrees outside.
- It was so hot.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.700
Troy, the actor who plays Akhmal...

30:48.710 --> 30:49.769
I don't know how to shoot gun!

30:49.770 --> 30:51.550
When he gets shot and
drops out of frame...

30:51.560 --> 30:52.859
I got fucking shot!

30:52.860 --> 30:54.840
- The dialogue is all looped.
- Yeah.

30:54.850 --> 30:56.230
What actually you would hear
on the production track

30:56.240 --> 30:57.680
is Alec and I cracking up.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.529
- I think every take we ruined.
- Yeah.

30:59.530 --> 31:01.000
You got good guys right here, man.

31:01.010 --> 31:02.960
Initially, it was, "My guys
are shit," and he goes,

31:02.970 --> 31:04.980
"Well, if we're shit, you're
the king of Shit Mountain."

31:04.990 --> 31:07.329
And then on one take,
Anthony improvised...

31:07.330 --> 31:09.100
Oh, my god, my guys suck
balls, you know it.

31:09.110 --> 31:13.520
And Troy, his line was shi... so
he went, "Well, we suck balls

31:13.530 --> 31:16.110
then you are king of
Suck Balls Mountain!"

31:16.450 --> 31:19.340
And we like lost it, like we had to cut.

31:19.350 --> 31:20.720
- Yeah.
- We all started laughing.

31:20.730 --> 31:22.460
The crew, everyone. And Troy was like,

31:22.470 --> 31:23.900
"I'm sorry, I didn't know what to say!"

31:23.910 --> 31:25.520
And we're like, "No, no, that's it now!"

31:25.530 --> 31:26.860
Like, "That's now just the line."

31:26.870 --> 31:29.540
If I suck balls, you are
king of Suck Balls Mountain!

31:29.550 --> 31:31.440
Shut the fuck up.

31:31.450 --> 31:33.100
What if I train your guys?

31:33.110 --> 31:34.820
Tao, one of our writers said,

31:34.830 --> 31:36.440
"What if Barry trained the Chechens?"

31:36.450 --> 31:38.480
These guys are like a
Seal Team Six, huh?

31:38.490 --> 31:39.920
Maybe even like a seven and a half.

31:39.930 --> 31:41.300
And what he learns is that it's not

31:41.310 --> 31:43.340
like really a teachable skill,

31:43.350 --> 31:46.560
but then he's seeing that
in this Mayrbek character.

31:46.570 --> 31:49.369
Yeah, and does Barry then
have a responsibility

31:49.370 --> 31:52.540
not to take this kid down
the same path he went?

31:53.320 --> 31:56.050
So this is how you're
earning a buck now, huh?

31:56.060 --> 31:57.540
Selling sports bras?

31:57.550 --> 31:59.010
I really liked that scene.

31:59.020 --> 32:01.219
Barry and Fuches have
kind of a tearful...

32:01.220 --> 32:03.810
- Reunion.
- Reunion in the Lululemon.

32:03.820 --> 32:06.720
There is oddly, an honesty
to their relationship.

32:06.730 --> 32:08.500
- Yeah.
- 'Cause he's the only guy

32:08.510 --> 32:10.769
on Earth who actually knows
who Barry really is.

32:10.770 --> 32:13.380
Yeah, that's that weird thing
of both things can be true.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.200
- I got ya.
- Fuches loves Barry,

32:15.210 --> 32:16.510
but he's also using him

32:16.520 --> 32:18.900
and is a bad guy.

32:18.910 --> 32:21.070
- I love you, man.
- Thanks, Fuches.
