I spoke to your father.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.848
I told him

your dad agreed to let you
stay with us
until he gets back.

05:02.603 --> 05:06.338

ruined our lives

some of your amazing
mom wisdom, Mrs. G.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.556

08:33.213 --> 08:34.980
Looks like you got
some color at the beach.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.381
Did you wear sunscreen?
Don't do that.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.049
Did you reapply
after you went in the water?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.317
Huh? Tell me.
I can't remember.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.119
I was having fun.
What about this apple?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.153
Did you wash it?
Yeah.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.022
Don't you lie to me.
It still has a sticker on it.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.726
Okay, damn it!
Just tell me what you want!
Just tell me!

08:47.728 --> 08:49.694
She's cheerleading
five days a week

08:49.696 --> 08:51.830
and yet you still
have her taking gym class.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.533
Okay, fine.
Want to have
study hall instead?

08:54.535 --> 08:56.101
Wait, for real?
Oh, yeah, sure.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.435
Keep being my mom.
Do it. Go.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.938
I also noticed
Lainey isn't cheer captain

08:59.940 --> 09:02.507
when she's clearly the most
talented dancer on the squad.

09:02.509 --> 09:06.278
I demand you make her captain,
and I want her
on top of the pyramid.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.748
Here's a list
of more demands.
Meet them.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.984
And wash that apple.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.521
My work is done here.
See you at dinner.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.990
What happened?
What did she do?

09:18.992 --> 09:22.260
I'm so angry
even though I don't have
any of the information.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.529
Chill.
It was actually awesome.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.531
She's gone.
You can drop the act now.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.065
It's not an act.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.200
No! Our mom is just
poisoning your mind

09:29.202 --> 09:31.069
with her endless well
of love and support.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.338
Yeah, I'm not seeing
how that's a bad thing.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.039
(SCOFFS)

09:34.041 --> 09:35.807
No,
where are you going?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.375
Cheer practice,
where I'm the captain.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.611
You can't leave.
We have a party to plan.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.446
Yeah, no party.
Not feeling it.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.815
Maybe some other time.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.717
What the hell
just happened?

09:45.719 --> 09:49.521
Did we just lose our kick-ass
<i> Risky Business</i> party?

09:49.523 --> 09:50.956
It's worse.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.291
We just lost Lainey.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.229
MR. GLASCOTT: Thanks
for coming in, Mr. Goldberg.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.399
Wanted to address this
teacher's lounge breach
head on.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.068
Couldn't this have been
a phone call?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.202
Believe me, I don't
want to be here either.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.938
After school,
I go to the mall
with my parrot

10:06.940 --> 10:09.174
and people
treat me with respect.

10:09.176 --> 10:12.310
Her name is
Feather Locklear.
Real head turner.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.412
Look, I'm sorry
I used the fax,

10:14.414 --> 10:16.181
but I just want
to reach my girlfriend.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.750
Again with the girlfriend!
Unbelievable!

10:18.752 --> 10:20.619
You're a guidance guy.
Guide him.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.054
Tell him long-distance
relationships don't work.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.489
I'm sorry,
I beg to differ.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.358
I've been in
a long-distance relationship

10:26.360 --> 10:27.993
for the past
seven years.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.160
BOTH: Really?
Yeah.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.796
Ellen lives in Tampa.
And I'm lucky, too,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.198
because Ellen
has a male roommate

10:33.200 --> 10:35.400
to keep an eye on her
when we're apart.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.568
She lives with a guy?

10:36.570 --> 10:38.236
Yeah, Todd.
He's a lifeguard,

10:38.238 --> 10:39.437
so he can totally
give her CPR

10:39.439 --> 10:41.506
if she ever gets
in any kind of trouble.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.741
He's a real stud.
(CHUCKLES)

10:42.743 --> 10:46.111
I mean, does he even
own a shirt?
(LAUGHS)

10:46.113 --> 10:47.646
See, Dad?
It can work.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.882
Okay, pay attention.
This might be helpful to you.

10:50.884 --> 10:55.220
Uh, this long-distance
girlfriend you got,
you see her much?

10:55.222 --> 10:56.554
Well, not since
she went to Paris.

10:56.556 --> 11:00.692
And of course,
Todd tagged along
because he speaks French.

11:00.694 --> 11:01.459
He's a good egg.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.695
It sounds like
she's with this Todd guy.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.896
(CHUCKLES)
No, no, no.

11:04.898 --> 11:08.133
She's taken his last name
for insurance purposes.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.201
Point is,
long-distance can work.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.571
I want to believe you,
but your story has some holes.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.607
Hey, don't flip
this back on me.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.909
You and Dana
are the ones on the rocks.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.879
Frankly, we used to gab
about you guys
in the teacher's lounge

11:20.881 --> 11:23.381
how we didn't think
your relationship had legs.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.482
You're both wrong.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.318
I may not be able
to call or fax Dana,

11:27.320 --> 11:29.087
but she will know
how I feel,

11:29.089 --> 11:31.790
even if it means
doing the unthinkable.

11:31.792 --> 11:35.660
Bro, you've come
to the right person
for love advice.

11:35.662 --> 11:36.227
Let's do this.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.862
ADULT ADAM: <i> Without the phone</i>
<i> or the fax,</i>

11:37.864 --> 11:40.365
<i> my only option</i>
<i> was a musical love letter,</i>

11:40.367 --> 11:43.234
<i> written by my brother</i>
<i> and starring me.</i>

11:43.236 --> 11:44.769
Hey, sweet baby girl.

11:44.771 --> 11:45.904
I know we can't talk
on the phone,

11:45.906 --> 11:49.374
so I'm gonna
just let the music
speak for me.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.842
And I'll be speaking, too,

11:50.844 --> 11:53.278
'cause this jam
is written by Big Tasty.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.547
Ain't that right,
lil' yum yum?

11:55.549 --> 11:56.648
That's not my name,
girl.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.684
ADULT ADAM: <i> While I was</i>
<i> tarting to feel</i>
<i> this was a bad idea,</i>

11:59.686 --> 12:01.119
<i> Lainey couldn't have felt</i>
<i> more at home.</i>

12:01.121 --> 12:04.989
So, then you're gonna
say to yourself,
"Hey, that's too much cheese."

12:04.991 --> 12:05.790
But you know what?

12:05.792 --> 12:07.425
It's never
too much cheese.

12:07.427 --> 12:11.096
God, this is so much better
than cold pizza every night.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.064
And I love that little note
you put in my lunch today.

12:13.066 --> 12:17.135
Well, I meant
every word of it,
my little snuggle monster.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.637
<i> Yep, Lainey was happy</i>
<i> to be a Goldberg,</i>

12:19.639 --> 12:21.906
<i> but the Goldbergs</i>
<i> weren't so happy.</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:23.908
It's like
there's two moms now.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.977
This is bad.
This is really bad.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.646
All I wanted was a kick-ass
<i> Risky Business</i> party

12:28.648 --> 12:31.716
and a free pass to Princeton.
Is that
too much to ask?

12:31.718 --> 12:32.984
Don't give up hope yet.
(SIGHS)

12:32.986 --> 12:36.020
It's time to bring out
the big guns.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.056
Tissue me.

12:39.092 --> 12:39.858
(CRYING)

12:39.860 --> 12:41.493
And then he said,
"Let's break up,"

12:41.495 --> 12:43.294
and I'm like,
"But I love you,"

12:43.296 --> 12:44.863
and he's like,
"I love you, too,

12:44.865 --> 12:45.830
"but I'm not in love
with you."

12:45.832 --> 12:51.770
I'm sorry, Lainey.
I just really need my mom's
full and undivided attention.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.474
Wow, it's so surprising
and unsettling to hear

12:56.476 --> 12:58.476
that you've had
a boyfriend all this time

12:58.478 --> 12:59.844
and none of us
knew about it.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.212
Say,
what was his name?

13:01.214 --> 13:02.914
(STAMMERING) His name?
Uh-huh.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.483
His, his name was, uh...

13:06.887 --> 13:07.619
Shrimpson.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.055
Shrimpson.
It's Dutch!
(CRYING)

13:11.057 --> 13:13.558
I'm sorry, Lainey.
Maybe you should go.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.159
No. No, no, no.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.661
You're just trying
to remove me
from her life

13:16.663 --> 13:20.198
just like
how you removed me
from yours.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.101
What? (SCOFFS)
How dare you.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.170
Good luck
with Mr. Shrimpsteen.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.272
It's Shrimpson!

13:27.274 --> 13:28.606
(CRYING)

13:28.608 --> 13:30.074
Okay,
what are you doing?

13:30.076 --> 13:32.343
Saving you.
From what?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.645
Your mom's cooking?

13:33.647 --> 13:35.680
Her sweet little notes?
Her support?

13:35.682 --> 13:36.714
Yeah, sure,
it seems nice now,

13:36.716 --> 13:39.684
but my mom loves us
more than any mom
loves her kids.

13:39.686 --> 13:42.453
I don't think
the problem here
is your mom.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.356
It's you.
You don't appreciate her.

13:45.358 --> 13:45.924
Fine.

13:45.926 --> 13:49.227
But don't say
I didn't warn you.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.567
Lainey.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.736
Come to temporary mommy.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.605
Lainey. Lainey!

14:03.743 --> 14:05.476
(TAPPING)

14:07.447 --> 14:10.048
Hi. (CHUCKLES)
What are you
doing here?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.149
In the middle
of the day?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.651
Oh, it's kind of my thing.
You'll see.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.887
I just wanted
to drop this off.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.121
SAT prep?

14:17.123 --> 14:19.023
Yeah, here's the thing.
I'm not going to college.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.526
What's that, now?
I want to be a dancer
in New York.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.128
Or Vegas,
whichever one's closer.

14:24.130 --> 14:24.662
Oh.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.532
That sounds fun.
But yeah,
you're going to college.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.700
I'm really not.
Oh, you are.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.070
I spoke to your father
about it, and he signed off.

14:32.072 --> 14:32.804
This is Raji.

14:32.806 --> 14:35.006
He'll be tutoring you
every day at study hall

14:35.008 --> 14:37.709
and Saturdays at 8:00 a.m.
When you're nice and fresh.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.878
I'll see you at dinner,
love bug.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.847
Your mom's very pushy.

14:42.849 --> 14:46.284
ADULT ADAM: <i> As Lainey</i>
<i> was starting to panic</i>
<i> about her new smother,</i>

14:46.286 --> 14:48.753
<i> I was finishing my love jam.</i>

14:48.755 --> 14:51.222
<i> ¶ Nothin' in between us</i>

15:10.343 --> 15:13.411

15:15.215 --> 15:16.581
It's bad, isn't it?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.815
It's not great.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.785
Well,
I've tried everything.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.186
You were right, Dad.

15:22.188 --> 15:25.156
Long distance
never works.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.058
You win.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.993
You know,
I seem to recall

15:28.995 --> 15:31.396
a certain
long-distance relationship

15:31.398 --> 15:32.563
that worked just fine.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.464
What are you
talking about?

15:33.466 --> 15:36.334
Those six months
you spent in ROTC

15:36.336 --> 15:37.068
away from Beverly.

15:37.070 --> 15:41.306
You know, when you called her
every single day.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.042
That was different.
I was an adult.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.009
Just 'cause he's a kid

15:45.011 --> 15:47.712
doesn't mean
his feelings aren't real.

15:47.714 --> 15:51.182
Trust me, Mur.
He loves that girl.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.619
<i> ¶ There's nothin'</i>
<i> in between us</i>

15:54.621 --> 15:56.621
<i> ¶ 'Cept love</i>

15:56.623 --> 15:59.090
<i> ¶ And dinosaurs ¶</i>

15:59.726 --> 16:00.825
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While I had given up,</i>

16:00.827 --> 16:03.861
<i> Erica and Lainey were</i>
<i> preparing to take on my mom.</i>

16:03.863 --> 16:05.697
What have I done?
I unleashed the beast.

16:05.699 --> 16:07.832
Oh, this is not good.
You were right.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.400
This isn't a time for
"I told you so."

16:09.402 --> 16:11.836
It's a time for action,
and I told you so!

16:11.838 --> 16:14.272
I'll do whatever you say
to make it stop.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.606
There's only one way.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.108
She thinks that
she calls the shots,

16:17.110 --> 16:20.244
but you have to break
her heart and show her
that you do.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.314
May I suggest
throwing a kick-ass
"risky business" party?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.750
Can you stop eavesdropping
like a weirdo?

16:25.752 --> 16:29.153
I eavesdrop like a badass,
and you know it.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.555
The weirdo's right.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.257
The party is back on.
Yes!

16:33.259 --> 16:33.858
GIRL: Whoo!

16:33.860 --> 16:36.761
<i> Within three hours,</i>
<i> Lainey's house was jumping.</i>

16:36.763 --> 16:37.562
<i> A little too much.</i>

16:37.564 --> 16:41.099
<i> The TV was stolen,</i>
<i> furniture was danced upon,</i>

16:41.101 --> 16:42.834
<i> the record player was pizza'd.</i>

16:42.836 --> 16:44.535
<i> Also, this lady showed up.</i>

16:44.537 --> 16:47.138
Hey, we wanted
"risky business," right?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.239
Yeah,
but not this much.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.842
I think there are actual
you-know-what-stitutes here.

16:50.844 --> 16:54.846
<i> Even the nice geeks at school</i>
<i> got swept up in the madness</i>

16:58.284 --> 17:00.018
(SLOW-MOTION) No!

17:00.020 --> 17:03.721
<i> Unfortunately, they let loose</i>

17:03.723 --> 17:05.723
<i> Lainey's dad had won</i>

17:05.725 --> 17:07.125
<i> This party needed a hero.</i>

17:07.127 --> 17:10.862
<i> And tonight,</i>
<i> it wasn't Tom Cruise.</i>

17:11.464 --> 17:12.263
<i> And...</i>

17:12.265 --> 17:14.732
<i> It wasn't Barry Goldberg.</i>

17:14.734 --> 17:16.701
<i> It was my mom.</i>

17:16.703 --> 17:19.604
<i> Turns out the only thing worse</i>
<i> than an insane party</i>

17:19.606 --> 17:22.273
<i> is an insanely mad smother.</i>

17:22.275 --> 17:26.577
<i> It was 1:00 a.m.,</i>
<i> and the party</i>
<i> was still raging.</i>

17:26.579 --> 17:27.178
<i> So was my mom.</i>

17:27.180 --> 17:30.848
I have failed as a mother
and as a temporary mother.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.482
Shame on you.

17:31.484 --> 17:35.019
Lying, sneaking out,
betraying my trust.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.054
I mean, come... Oh.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.956
My God.
Thank you for coming.

17:39.626 --> 17:40.425
I'm so sorry.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.927
Oh.
Save us from ourselves.

17:42.929 --> 17:43.327
Shh.

17:43.329 --> 17:46.631
Everything's gonna be
all right. Mama will fix it.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.265
(CHUCKLES)

17:47.267 --> 17:51.269
Just let me soak in this hug
for one more moment.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.303
<i> And then the fixing began,</i>

17:52.305 --> 17:55.873
<i> as my mom made the coolest</i>
<i> party painfully uncool.</i>

17:55.875 --> 17:58.042
I know I told you
never to Tom Cruise the floor,

17:58.044 --> 18:01.612
but sometimes you just got to
say, "what the (BLEEP)"

18:09.222 --> 18:11.456
<i> Turns out</i>

18:11.458 --> 18:13.825
<i> to have a smother</i>
<i> so embarrassing</i>

18:13.827 --> 18:14.859
<i> that she can clear out</i>

18:14.861 --> 18:18.696

<i> that Lainey was right.</i>

18:18.698 --> 18:21.199

18:21.201 --> 18:22.100

I'm okay.

<i> ...and when the smoke clears,</i>

18:32.178 --> 18:34.045
Thank you for staying.

18:34.047 --> 18:36.547
It was
pretty cool of you.

18:36.549 --> 18:37.782
Look.

18:37.784 --> 18:41.686
I know I got carried away
with Lainey.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.187
(CHUCKLES)

18:43.189 --> 18:44.088
It's just...

18:44.090 --> 18:48.459
I loved having someone
who was willing to listen.

18:49.028 --> 18:52.296
Someone who's not always
pushing me away.

18:52.298 --> 18:56.434
And I know you
love us more
than anything.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.137
And we
appreciate it.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.438
We really do.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.707
So maybe you won't
push me away as much?

19:02.709 --> 19:05.643
Depends if you won't
get carried away so much.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.546
Yeah,
both aren't gonna happen.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.881
(CHUCKLES)

19:09.883 --> 19:11.983
For now.

<i> they'll never let you go.</i>

19:18.725 --> 19:22.026
<i> And sometimes, they give you</i>
<i> just the push you need.</i>

19:22.028 --> 19:23.427
What you writing?

19:23.429 --> 19:25.730
It's called
a break-up letter.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.364
Put your pen down.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.799
You don't have to break up
with what's-her-face.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.468
Her name is...
Dana, yes.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.937
I know.
I know. I know.

19:32.939 --> 19:33.538
(SIGHS)

19:33.540 --> 19:35.840
How about
if I let you
call her again?

19:35.842 --> 19:36.574
Wait. Seriously?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.676
Ten minutes a night.
Will that work?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.111
Really?
Ten minutes.

19:40.113 --> 19:41.612
Not a second more.
I mean it.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.014
I got a stopwatch
in the drawer.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.449
You said
long distance was impossible.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.450
Yeah, well,
I remembered

19:46.452 --> 19:48.786
that I actually knew a guy
who pulled it off.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.754
Really?
Yeah.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.490
No matter how far away
the girl was, he loved her,

19:52.492 --> 19:54.725
and that's all
that mattered.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.927
I love Dana.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.328
I... I really do.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.397
Well, then,
make that call.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.132
But 10 minutes only.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.710
Yeah, I did.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.245
Oh, my God,
that was amazing.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.947
You know
what the best part was?

20:15.949 --> 20:17.348
What?

20:17.350 --> 20:18.115
I saw it with you.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.585
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was a night</i>
<i> I'd remember forever.</i>

20:20.587 --> 20:23.054
<i> Sure, Dana and I</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:24.355

okay?

20:55.922 --> 20:59.624
Don't you see we're young?
It doesn't matter what we do.

just take a tab?

21:08.635 --> 21:10.434
Oh, my God,
you have no idea

21:10.436 --> 21:12.370
how long I've waited
for this moment.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.304
Yeah,
I just wanted to...

21:13.306 --> 21:16.340
Learn how to shred the axe?
You will.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.876
Oh.
You just wanted to...

21:18.878 --> 21:21.145
It lost
its minty flavor.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.883
Wait a minute.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.185
Ellen is with Todd.
