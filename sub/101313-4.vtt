12:05.015 --> 12:06.892
<i>-Ow!</i>
<i>-[Lucifer] You again?</i>

12:06.976 --> 12:09.937
<i>Oh, dear! Are-- Are you certain</i>
<i>you don't want me to get involved?</i>

12:10.020 --> 12:12.148
<i>It feels a little unsporting</i>
<i>just standing here.</i>

12:12.982 --> 12:14.400
<i>I take it back.</i>

12:15.526 --> 12:16.569
<i>[woman screams]</i>

12:18.529 --> 12:20.531
<i>[dogs barking]</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:30.458
<i>[cat screeches]</i>

12:38.758 --> 12:40.843
<i>Warmed them up for you, Mr. Stompanato.</i>

12:44.764 --> 12:46.098
<i>Thanks, boys.</i>

12:47.725 --> 12:49.185
<i>Wait, hold it!</i>

12:49.310 --> 12:50.686
<i>Oh, for crying out loud.</i>

12:50.770 --> 12:52.980
<i>I thought you said </i>Mr.<i> Stompanato.</i>

12:53.564 --> 12:54.982
<i>"Mr." is a man.</i>

12:55.065 --> 12:58.194
<i>Did you or did you not request</i>
<i>a gender-balanced narrative?</i>

12:58.277 --> 13:00.362
<i>I'm simply following your instructions.</i>

13:03.240 --> 13:06.577
<i>Perhaps you're wondering</i>
<i>why I gathered you here this fine evening.</i>

13:07.286 --> 13:08.162
<i>Thing is...</i>

13:09.538 --> 13:12.917
<i>I don't like folks asking questions</i>
<i>in my club.</i>

13:13.751 --> 13:16.045
<i>Sticking noses where they don't belong.</i>

13:16.962 --> 13:17.797
<i>So...</i>

13:19.131 --> 13:20.549
<i>if you could refrain...</i>

13:21.550 --> 13:23.719
<i>oh, I would deeply appreciate it.</i>

13:25.095 --> 13:26.388
<i>Because next time...</i>

13:28.849 --> 13:30.643
<i>I won't be so nice.</i>

13:32.353 --> 13:33.896
<i>That means you're gonna die.</i>

13:37.775 --> 13:39.360
<i>[henchmen laughing]</i>

13:43.030 --> 13:44.824
<i>And you...</i>

13:47.034 --> 13:49.036
<i>You're lucky you're a friend of Lily's.</i>

13:51.455 --> 13:52.873
<i>But don't get too friendly.</i>

13:57.253 --> 13:58.629
<i>Enjoy your evening.</i>

14:01.549 --> 14:02.633
<i>Let's go, boys.</i>

14:10.808 --> 14:12.810
<i>Yeah, thanks for having my six back there.</i>

14:12.893 --> 14:15.437
<i>But you told me to stay behind you,</i>

14:15.896 --> 14:18.816
<i>which wasn't easy, considering you spent</i>
<i>so much time on the pavement.</i>

14:20.317 --> 14:21.819
<i>So, what now?</i>

14:24.029 --> 14:26.699
<i>Well, we'll check out Lucky Larry's</i>
<i>usual haunts in the morning.</i>

14:26.782 --> 14:28.826
<i>You know,</i>
<i>petty thieves are like bad pennies.</i>

14:28.909 --> 14:30.744
<i>Sooner or later, they always turn up.</i>

14:31.287 --> 14:32.371
<i>Well, then.</i>

14:32.454 --> 14:36.333
<i>I am off to trip the light fantastic</i>
<i>with your city's best and brightest.</i>

14:36.417 --> 14:37.376
<i>[chuckles]</i>

14:37.793 --> 14:39.795
<i>I assume you have plans of your own.</i>

14:40.754 --> 14:42.006
<i>What can I say?</i>

14:42.256 --> 14:44.133
<i>Life's one big party.</i>

14:47.595 --> 14:48.888
<i>[Lucifer] </i>Little did I know,

14:48.971 --> 14:51.891
<i>Jack and his wife, Shirley, </i>
<i>were going through a rough patch.</i>

14:52.057 --> 14:53.392
<i>[Shirley] How are the potatoes?</i>

14:53.475 --> 14:54.435
<i>[Jack grunts]</i>

14:58.522 --> 15:01.150
<i>I made them with cream,</i>
<i>just like you like.</i>

15:06.655 --> 15:07.615
<i>Um...</i>

15:07.948 --> 15:09.325
<i>What happened with your eye?</i>

15:12.661 --> 15:13.537
<i>Nothing.</i>

15:14.663 --> 15:16.165
<i>Jack, I know you're still sore with me,</i>

15:16.248 --> 15:17.499
<i>-but you can't just--</i>
<i>-Excuse me.</i>

15:18.083 --> 15:19.376
<i>Lost my appetite.</i>

15:21.670 --> 15:22.713
<i>[door knocks]</i>

15:22.796 --> 15:26.008
<i>God forbid a man gets</i>
<i>a moment's peace around here.</i>

<i>[sighs deeply]</i>

15:32.932 --> 15:34.099
<i>[suspensful music plays]</i>

15:35.351 --> 15:36.435
<i>Lucky Larry?</i>

<i>[groans]</i>

15:38.646 --> 15:39.647
<i>[screams]</i>

15:44.526 --> 15:46.070
<i>[suspensful music crescendos]</i>

15:52.618 --> 15:53.911
<i>Give me that name again.</i>

15:57.206 --> 16:00.459
<i>I have to say,</i>
<i>that dress is a lovely color on you.</i>

16:01.085 --> 16:04.338
<i>What say we leave the dishes</i>
<i>and take it for a spin at the Copacabana?</i>

16:04.421 --> 16:06.840
<i>Well, that's sweet of you,</i>
<i>Mr. Morningstar, but...</i>

16:07.466 --> 16:09.134
<i>I already have my dance partner.</i>

16:09.218 --> 16:10.260
<i>Oh.</i>

16:11.178 --> 16:12.304
<i>At least, I thought I did.</i>

16:13.305 --> 16:14.306
<i>All right, thanks.</i>

16:18.978 --> 16:23.190
<i>If you know what's good for you,</i>
<i>you stay the hell away from my wife.</i>

16:23.273 --> 16:24.525
<i>Well, I didn't think you'd mind,</i>

16:24.608 --> 16:27.069
<i>considering you haven't said</i>
<i>two words to her since I arrived.</i>

16:27.152 --> 16:28.988
<i>I just got off the horn with my informant.</i>

16:29.071 --> 16:32.908
<i>Apparently, Lucky Larry got into it</i>
<i>with someone down at the docks yesterday.</i>

16:33.283 --> 16:37.287
<i>A, uh, bratwurst heir</i>
<i>by the name of William Kincannon.</i>

16:37.830 --> 16:39.581
<i>Folks call him "Willy the Sausage Prince."</i>

16:40.374 --> 16:41.792
<i>Sounds like an upstanding fellow.</i>

16:41.875 --> 16:44.420
<i>Yeah, well, we'll bust his chops</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

16:47.214 --> 16:49.299
<i>Jack, where are you going?</i>

16:49.383 --> 16:50.217
<i>[Jack] I, um...</i>

16:50.300 --> 16:52.553
<i>I think it's gonna be</i>
<i>an early morning and, uh...</i>

16:53.137 --> 16:54.013
<i>I'll just...</i>

16:55.222 --> 16:56.348
<i>sleep at the office.</i>

17:00.185 --> 17:04.106
<i>So, what did the missus do</i>
<i>to get your trousers in such a twist?</i>

17:04.398 --> 17:05.441
<i>Cheat on you?</i>

17:05.941 --> 17:08.402
<i>Kick your dog? Ruin your favorite shirt?</i>

17:08.819 --> 17:09.987
<i>None of the above.</i>

17:10.070 --> 17:11.655
<i>Couple weeks back, I...</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:16.201
<i>went out with some of my army pals, and...</i>

17:17.202 --> 17:18.245
<i>[sighs]</i>

17:18.328 --> 17:20.581
<i>a few drinks in, the captain says to me...</i>

17:22.416 --> 17:25.461
<i>"You and Shirley were</i>
<i>the best 20 bucks I ever spent."</i>

17:28.255 --> 17:31.133
<i>Well, I thought it was fate</i>
<i>that brought Shirley and I together</i>

17:31.216 --> 17:33.135
<i>in the public library that day.</i>

17:33.927 --> 17:35.387
<i>All along, it was...</i>

17:36.013 --> 17:37.097
<i>just about money.</i>

17:37.723 --> 17:39.558
<i>-Shirley was a call girl?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

17:40.642 --> 17:41.560
<i>That's right.</i>

17:41.643 --> 17:44.313
<i>And rousting me out of my shell shock</i>
<i>was her final trick.</i>

17:44.855 --> 17:45.689
<i>Well.</i>

17:46.148 --> 17:47.900
<i>Aren't you lucky</i>

17:47.983 --> 17:50.944
<i>to benefit from the experience</i>
<i>your wife has gained</i>

17:51.028 --> 17:53.530
<i>with dozens, maybe hundreds of men?</i>

17:54.198 --> 17:57.201
<i>Firemen, barbers,</i>
<i>sailors, carnival barkers--</i>

17:57.284 --> 17:58.410
<i>Yeah, I get it.</i>

18:00.037 --> 18:02.873
<i>Well, if it bothers you so much,</i>
<i>why not just up stakes and leave?</i>

18:02.956 --> 18:06.585
<i>Well, because I love her,</i>
<i>and, uh, she says she loves me.</i>

18:08.378 --> 18:11.507
<i>So when you find out the best thing that</i>
<i>ever happened to you started with a lie,</i>

18:11.590 --> 18:13.759
<i>well, it's like building a house</i>
<i>on quicksand.</i>

18:14.426 --> 18:16.428
<i>Sooner or later, it all falls apart.</i>

18:18.722 --> 18:20.849
<i>Sorry, got lost in a daydream,</i>

18:20.933 --> 18:24.478
<i>on account of your problem</i>
<i>being so extraordinarily boring.</i>

18:25.354 --> 18:27.773
<i>Have you considered forgetting about it?</i>

18:29.650 --> 18:32.027
<i>Have I considered forgetting about it?</i>

18:32.736 --> 18:33.987
<i>Is that your advice?</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:35.823
<i>-Well, in my experience...</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

18:35.906 --> 18:39.118
<i>...problems are like Bible salesmen, or...</i>

18:39.618 --> 18:40.661
<i>genital warts.</i>

18:41.203 --> 18:44.081
<i>If you pretend they're not there,</i>
<i>sooner or later, they disappear.</i>

18:52.714 --> 18:54.550
<i>Can you not paint the sword first?</i>

18:54.633 --> 18:56.176
<i>It's ridiculously heavy.</i>

18:56.260 --> 18:58.011
<i>Perhaps you'd like a break, sir.</i>

18:58.095 --> 18:59.054
<i>[groans]</i>

18:59.179 --> 19:00.013
<i>[Jack] Yeah.</i>

19:02.641 --> 19:05.727
<i>Why don't you take a load off, Willy?</i>

19:05.811 --> 19:07.312
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

19:07.396 --> 19:09.022
<i>Jack Monroe, PI.</i>

19:09.106 --> 19:11.108
<i>Lucifer Morningstar, Devil.</i>

19:11.942 --> 19:12.901
<i>Carmina!</i>

19:13.610 --> 19:14.570
<i>Tea!</i>

19:20.325 --> 19:23.078
<i>My dear friend Sigmund</i>
<i>would have had a field day with you.</i>

19:24.037 --> 19:24.872
<i>Where's the ring?</i>

19:25.831 --> 19:26.665
<i>The what?</i>

19:26.748 --> 19:28.333
<i>Never mind, I'll find it myself.</i>

19:29.334 --> 19:30.252
<i>What are you doing?</i>

19:30.711 --> 19:32.296
<i>What is he doing? What is he doing?</i>

19:32.379 --> 19:34.047
<i>Can you please tell me what he's doing?</i>

19:34.339 --> 19:36.425
<i>Hey, I wouldn't worry about that.</i>

19:36.842 --> 19:38.135
<i>What I would worry about is,</i>

19:38.218 --> 19:42.389
<i>we heard you had a pretty heated exchange</i>
<i>down at the docks yesterday.</i>

19:42.723 --> 19:44.224
<i>Guy named Lucky Larry.</i>

19:45.017 --> 19:45.893
<i>So?</i>

19:46.518 --> 19:49.771
<i>So Lucky Larry stole my friend's ring</i>
<i>and then wound up dead.</i>

19:49.855 --> 19:51.982
<i>Stabbed in the back,</i>
<i>some sort of fancy knife.</i>

19:52.065 --> 19:52.900
<i>[Willy laughs]</i>

19:52.983 --> 19:55.736
<i>Wait, you think I killed him?</i>

19:56.445 --> 19:57.529
<i>I would never.</i>

19:58.488 --> 20:01.241
<i>I mean, I could if I had to, but I didn't.</i>

20:01.325 --> 20:03.035
<i>And I don't know anything about a ring.</i>

20:03.118 --> 20:05.120
<i>Does anyone know about your whereabouts</i>
<i>last night?</i>

20:05.204 --> 20:06.038
<i>Yes.</i>

20:06.538 --> 20:07.664
<i>My portraitist.</i>

20:07.748 --> 20:10.918
<i>I was posing as Hannibal crossing the Alps</i>
<i>until almost midnight.</i>

20:11.001 --> 20:14.546
<i>The overtime fees for a rental elephant</i>
<i>are unconscionable.</i>

20:14.630 --> 20:16.632
<i>How do you know Lucky Larry exactly?</i>

20:16.715 --> 20:18.717
<i>-[grunts]</i>
<i>-[armor clanging]</i>

20:20.135 --> 20:21.637
<i>[groans]</i>

20:21.720 --> 20:22.930
<i>[gasps]</i>

20:23.388 --> 20:25.224
<i>[grunting]</i>

20:27.100 --> 20:28.435
<i>From time to time,</i>

20:28.936 --> 20:32.105
<i>I purchase a trinket or two from Laurence.</i>

20:32.689 --> 20:35.943
<i>How they come into his possession,</i>
<i>I do not ask.</i>

20:36.235 --> 20:38.654
<i>I collect </i>objets de guerre.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.199
<i>If he has something that I enjoy,</i>
<i>he calls me.</i>

20:43.325 --> 20:45.452
<i>I just love war, don't you?</i>

20:47.829 --> 20:48.664
<i>Sure.</i>

20:49.998 --> 20:50.832
<i>Fifth Infantry.</i>

20:51.291 --> 20:52.501
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>

20:53.210 --> 20:56.296
<i>And now, where exactly did you serve?</i>

20:56.380 --> 20:57.464
<i>I would have, but...</i>

20:58.382 --> 20:59.299
<i>asthma.</i>

20:59.841 --> 21:02.219
<i>That's why I was so upset when Lucky Larry</i>

21:02.302 --> 21:04.846
<i>insisted that we have our meeting</i>
<i>up on the docks.</i>

21:04.930 --> 21:06.390
<i>There was dirt everywhere.</i>

21:06.932 --> 21:08.809
<i>I'm almost certain I stepped in feces.</i>

21:09.393 --> 21:12.020
<i>I'm beginning to think</i>
<i>that Willy here doesn't have the brains</i>

21:12.104 --> 21:13.146
<i>to have nicked Lily's ring.</i>

21:13.230 --> 21:14.523
<i>-[Willy chuckles]</i>
<i>-No kidding.</i>

21:14.856 --> 21:16.400
<i>Where do you and Larry meet normally?</i>

21:16.650 --> 21:17.734
<i>At his apartment.</i>

21:17.818 --> 21:19.653
<i>It's not much cleaner than the docks.</i>

21:19.736 --> 21:22.447
<i>And yes, I will have Carmina</i>
<i>write down the address for you.</i>

21:23.699 --> 21:24.574
<i>Thanks.</i>

21:26.451 --> 21:28.203
<i>-Quite a unique fellow, aren't you?</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

21:29.496 --> 21:32.791
<i>There's a word to describe you,</i>
<i>but I can't quite put my finger on it.</i>

21:34.334 --> 21:36.336
<i>It's like a shower, but French.</i>

21:36.920 --> 21:38.964
<i>Oh, I'm sure it'll come to me.</i>

21:39.047 --> 21:40.090
<i>[Willy] Hmm. </i>

21:41.550 --> 21:43.260
<i>[jazz piano playing]</i>

21:43.510 --> 21:45.804
<i>Private dick track down</i>
<i>that ring of yours?</i>

21:45.887 --> 21:46.847
<i>Hardly.</i>

21:46.930 --> 21:48.932
<i>Our best lead just turned up dead.</i>

21:49.433 --> 21:50.392
<i>[sighs]</i>

21:51.059 --> 21:52.853
<i>Sounds like that ring meant a lot to you.</i>

21:57.899 --> 22:00.819
<i>I was married, a long time ago.</i>

22:01.945 --> 22:03.196
<i>Guy named Adam.</i>

22:04.656 --> 22:07.284
<i>Things weren't great between us.</i>

22:07.743 --> 22:09.828
<i>Even worse between me and his father.</i>

22:10.245 --> 22:11.621
<i>-Sorry.</i>
<i>-Don't be.</i>

22:12.539 --> 22:15.208
<i>By the time they sent me away,</i>
<i>it was almost a relief.</i>

22:16.835 --> 22:20.756
<i>I took one little piece of that garden</i>
<i>on the way out.</i>

22:21.923 --> 22:23.759
<i>The stone that was in my ring.</i>

22:26.219 --> 22:28.930
<i>I didn't like much of anything</i>
<i>about my life back then.</i>

22:30.432 --> 22:32.726
<i>But I sure did love that garden.</i>

22:36.563 --> 22:37.439
<i>Anyway.</i>

22:38.648 --> 22:41.985
<i>The ring reminds me that</i>
<i>I don't need Adam or his family,</i>

22:42.652 --> 22:43.862
<i>that I don't need anybody.</i>

22:44.738 --> 22:45.947
<i>Oh, Lily.</i>

22:46.031 --> 22:47.157
<i>You're married, right?</i>

22:48.367 --> 22:49.201
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:50.660 --> 22:52.329
<i>To my high school sweetheart, Bill.</i>

22:53.663 --> 22:55.624
<i>We got hitched just before he enlisted.</i>

22:56.500 --> 22:58.001
<i>Wrote each other every day...</i>

22:59.836 --> 23:02.005
<i>until he got wounded in Guadalcanal.</i>

23:04.216 --> 23:05.342
<i>But he made it out,</i>

23:05.425 --> 23:07.219
<i>all the way to the VA upstate.</i>

23:09.554 --> 23:11.098
<i>But the doctors, they can't...</i>

23:13.350 --> 23:15.185
<i>We've known each other all our lives.</i>

23:16.937 --> 23:18.105
<i>I just can't believe...</i>

23:18.939 --> 23:19.981
<i>I might lose him.</i>

23:21.525 --> 23:24.319
<i>Guess I'm lucky I never got attached</i>
<i>to anybody that way.</i>

23:24.403 --> 23:25.445
<i>Don't you say that!</i>

23:26.780 --> 23:29.074
<i>Every day with my Bill is a gift.</i>

23:31.827 --> 23:33.954
<i>Knowing we may not have much time left...</i>

23:36.206 --> 23:37.833
<i>only makes it that much sweeter.</i>

23:44.589 --> 23:45.924
<i>[Lucifer sniffing]</i>

23:46.383 --> 23:47.551
<i>Ugh!</i>

23:48.718 --> 23:51.054
<i>Well, I don't know why</i>
<i>they called him </i>Lucky<i> Larry.</i>

23:52.305 --> 23:56.268
<i>This apartment is literally</i>
<i>the most depressing hovel I've ever seen,</i>

23:56.852 --> 23:58.687
<i>and I've seen Kafka's Hell loop.</i>

24:05.944 --> 24:07.487
<i>Your friend's ring might not be here,</i>

24:07.571 --> 24:10.323
<i>but there is plenty of useful information.</i>

24:10.407 --> 24:12.159
<i>-You see this rug, crumpled up?</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

24:12.242 --> 24:15.620
<i>I think this is where our killer</i>
<i>bopped Larry right in the kisser.</i>

24:16.538 --> 24:18.373
<i>Larry falls backwards, here,</i>

24:18.457 --> 24:19.624
<i>hits his head</i>

24:19.708 --> 24:22.169
<i>right here on the table,</i>
<i>where you see these wood chips.</i>

24:22.252 --> 24:23.211
<i>[Lucifer] Mm-hmm.</i>

24:24.129 --> 24:25.005
<i>But then...</i>

24:25.922 --> 24:26.923
<i>he shakes it off.</i>

24:27.007 --> 24:32.137
<i>He gets up and he charges at our killer.</i>
<i>You, like this.</i>

24:32.637 --> 24:34.431
<i>-Oh!</i>
<i>-He knocks the wind out of him.</i>

24:34.514 --> 24:36.391
<i>-Sorry, pal.</i>
<i>-That's all right, I love role play.</i>

24:36.475 --> 24:40.061
<i>Things are looking up for our pal Larry,</i>
<i>until the killer pulls out a knife.</i>

24:40.937 --> 24:42.481
<i>-Ah-ha!</i>
<i>-Larry...</i>

24:43.106 --> 24:46.026
<i>heads to the window,</i>
<i>but the window was painted shut.</i>

24:46.443 --> 24:49.696
<i>He tried, he wrenched it open.</i>

24:51.990 --> 24:54.367
<i>He got halfway out when the killer...</i>

24:55.869 --> 24:57.662
<i>comes over, stabs him in the back...</i>

24:58.872 --> 24:59.873
<i>creating that</i>

25:00.415 --> 25:01.249
<i>blood spatter.</i>

25:01.917 --> 25:02.959
<i>Oh!</i>

25:03.251 --> 25:04.961
<i>[sighs] And then...</i>

25:05.921 --> 25:08.882
<i>Larry escapes into the evening.</i>

25:09.633 --> 25:11.885
<i>Only to expire on your doorstep.</i>

25:13.094 --> 25:15.180
<i>I just wish we had some more evidence</i>

25:15.263 --> 25:17.682
<i>pointing us to whoever dusted</i>
<i>poor old Larry.</i>

25:19.351 --> 25:20.435
<i>Well, actually,</i>

25:21.144 --> 25:22.687
<i>I might have something.</i>

25:23.897 --> 25:24.814
<i>[sniffs]</i>

25:25.148 --> 25:27.108
<i>A very expensive cigar.</i>

25:27.192 --> 25:28.652
<i>Well, just the tip. [chuckles]</i>

25:28.735 --> 25:31.780
<i>Romeo y Julieta,</i>
<i>a favorite of Winston Churchill and...</i>

25:31.863 --> 25:32.864
<i>Our old pal...</i>

25:32.948 --> 25:34.658
<i>-Tony Stompanato.</i>
<i>-Tony Stompanato.</i>

25:40.705 --> 25:41.540
<i>[Jack] Huh.</i>

25:44.042 --> 25:47.504
<i>So Stompanato finds out</i>
<i>Lucky Larry stole his girl's ring...</i>

25:48.547 --> 25:49.589
<i>poses as a buyer...</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:51.424
<i>gets the ring back.</i>

25:51.508 --> 25:53.385
<i>Then kills the thief to avenge the girl.</i>

25:53.468 --> 25:56.137
<i>But if Stompanato did all this</i>
<i>to impress Lily Rose...</i>

25:56.221 --> 25:57.430
<i>Why not give her the ring?</i>

25:57.514 --> 25:58.390
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:00.100 --> 26:02.102
<i>[suspenseful music plays]</i>

26:12.696 --> 26:15.365
<i>[suspensful music crescendos]</i>

26:27.502 --> 26:29.337
<i>Rise and shine, Stompanato.</i>

26:47.272 --> 26:49.774
<i>That certainly explains</i>
<i>why he never gave Lily's ring back.</i>

26:50.734 --> 26:54.154
<i>Looks like Mr. Stompanato's bark</i>
<i>was worse than his bite.</i>

27:03.330 --> 27:04.331
<i>They took his heart.</i>

27:05.040 --> 27:06.416
<i>What do you think they did with it?</i>

27:06.499 --> 27:08.668
<i>Well, he didn't seem the type</i>
<i>to wear it on his sleeve.</i>

27:08.752 --> 27:09.878
<i>I'll check the floor.</i>

27:09.961 --> 27:10.920
<i>[Jack] Ugh.</i>

27:15.675 --> 27:16.509
<i>Huh.</i>

27:17.260 --> 27:20.513
<i>Looks like we were right about</i>
<i>Stompanato rubbing out Lucky Larry.</i>

27:21.431 --> 27:23.975
<i>Same insignia as the knife</i>
<i>in Lucky Larry's back.</i>

27:24.059 --> 27:26.853
<i>But who rubbed out Stompanato?</i>

27:26.936 --> 27:29.272
<i>I think I know the answer to that.</i>

27:29.356 --> 27:31.191
<i>A man after his own heart,</i>

27:31.524 --> 27:33.276
<i>and Lily Rose's ring.</i>

27:34.778 --> 27:37.822
<i>[sighs] But it appears we're too late</i>
<i>on both counts.</i>

27:38.907 --> 27:41.076
<i>Who would have the stones</i>
<i>to carve up Stompanato,</i>

27:41.159 --> 27:43.536
<i>and what's that wackadoo symbol</i>
<i>on his face?</i>

27:43.745 --> 27:44.954
<i>They're hieroglyphics.</i>

27:47.374 --> 27:48.875
<i>I believe it's the Eye of Horus,</i>

27:48.958 --> 27:51.169
<i>a sacred symbol</i>
<i>in ancient Egyptian culture.</i>

27:51.628 --> 27:52.671
<i>Sacred eye.</i>

27:54.047 --> 27:55.423
<i>I've heard that before.</i>

27:55.799 --> 27:57.884
<i>I think I know where to find</i>
<i>our graffiti artist.</i>

28:09.187 --> 28:10.271
<i>[Jack] Hmm.</i>

28:14.734 --> 28:16.236
<i>-Salutations.</i>
<i>-Bloody hell!</i>

28:17.320 --> 28:18.446
<i>[gasps]</i>

28:18.780 --> 28:20.323
<i>Have you come seeking...</i>

28:21.282 --> 28:22.242
<i>books?</i>

28:22.742 --> 28:25.704
<i>Yeah, we have come...</i>

28:26.830 --> 28:28.790
<i>seeking books.</i>

28:29.082 --> 28:29.916
<i>Oh.</i>

28:31.126 --> 28:33.962
<i>Thought you were here</i>
<i>for the secret cult ceremony.</i>

28:34.045 --> 28:35.630
<i>Sorry, my friend is new.</i>

28:35.714 --> 28:38.800
<i>We are </i>absolutely <i>here</i>
<i>for the secret cult ceremony.</i>

28:39.134 --> 28:41.261
<i>If you wouldn't mind pointing us</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

28:41.594 --> 28:42.846
<i>Right through that door.</i>

28:43.346 --> 28:45.515
<i>And if you haven't mail-ordered</i>
<i>your robes yet,</i>

28:45.598 --> 28:47.684
<i>there's a few extra</i>
<i>hanging on the coat rack.</i>

28:48.226 --> 28:49.436
<i>Mm. Mm-hmm.</i>

28:50.353 --> 28:51.187
<i>Lovely.</i>

28:51.521 --> 28:52.355
<i>Thank you.</i>

29:16.045 --> 29:18.673
<i>Melvin the Magnificent, at your service!</i>

29:18.757 --> 29:20.425
<i>What is it with this place?</i>

29:20.508 --> 29:22.510
<i>Board-certified priest, oracle,</i>

29:22.594 --> 29:24.804
<i>shaman, and justice of the peace.</i>

<i>How may I assist you?</i>

29:26.723 --> 29:28.349
<i>Lift a curse? Cure a nasty rash?</i>

29:28.433 --> 29:31.853
<i>I got a love spell guaranteed</i>
<i>to reel in a dame at 50 paces.</i>

29:31.936 --> 29:34.314
<i>We're looking for something</i>
<i>much stronger than that.</i>

29:34.856 --> 29:38.651
<i>Preferably Egyptian, possibly involving</i>
<i>the removal of a heart.</i>

29:40.111 --> 29:41.196
<i>Ah...</i>

29:42.322 --> 29:45.950
<i>You seek the ceremony of Anubis.</i>

29:46.618 --> 29:49.871
<i>Yes, we do.</i>
<i>We'll take one of those, please.</i>

29:49.954 --> 29:50.830
<i>Very well.</i>

29:52.165 --> 29:53.124
<i>Look over there!</i>

29:57.837 --> 29:59.923
<i>For just 12 dollars, 12 dollars,</i>

30:00.006 --> 30:02.759
<i>our deluxe ceremony of Anubis includes</i>

30:02.842 --> 30:05.762
<i>this ceremonial mask, two acolytes,</i>

<i>and a drum made from the skin</i>
<i>of a Vestal Virgin,</i>

30:08.139 --> 30:09.933
<i>a gilded sacrificial dagger,</i>

30:10.016 --> 30:12.602
<i>and one live...</i>

30:12.685 --> 30:13.520
<i>chicken!</i>

30:14.479 --> 30:16.606
<i>-It never ends well for the chicken.</i>
<i>-[groans]</i>

30:16.689 --> 30:19.651
<i>Or you might prefer</i>

30:19.984 --> 30:21.236
<i>our economy package.</i>

30:22.195 --> 30:23.196
<i>Uh...</i>

30:23.279 --> 30:24.656
<i>only six dollars!</i>

30:25.156 --> 30:27.784
<i>And the chicken heart comes pre-sacrificed</i>
<i>for your convenience.</i>

30:27.867 --> 30:30.036
<i>[Lucifer] Not accurate, </i>
<i>historically speaking,</i>

30:30.119 --> 30:31.704
<i>but quite, uh, bloody.</i>

30:31.788 --> 30:33.748
<i>My old friend</i>
<i>Tutankhamen would've loved it.</i>

30:34.123 --> 30:37.377
<i>In the modern age,</i>
<i>we are taught to fear death.</i>

30:37.919 --> 30:40.213
<i>But the ancients understood that death...</i>

30:41.130 --> 30:42.048
<i>is power.</i>

30:42.131 --> 30:44.884
<i>[suspensful music plays]</i>

30:45.635 --> 30:46.886
<i>Did you feel powerful</i>

30:47.720 --> 30:51.266
<i>when you were holding Tommy Stompanato's</i>
<i>heart in your hands after you killed him?</i>

30:53.268 --> 30:55.311
<i>Somebody killed Tommy Stompanato?</i>

30:57.188 --> 31:00.275
<i>You... You can't possibly believe that</i>
<i>I had anything to do with that.</i>

31:00.358 --> 31:02.068
<i>Oh, yeah. We absolutely do.</i>

31:02.151 --> 31:05.071
<i>Yes, tell us, Melvin the Magnificent.</i>

31:05.613 --> 31:07.407
<i>What is it you desire?</i>

31:09.742 --> 31:11.369
<i>-I...</i>
<i>-Yeah...</i>

31:11.452 --> 31:12.287
<i>...want...</i>

31:13.079 --> 31:13.913
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:14.414 --> 31:16.332
<i>...a 1941 Pontiac Torpedo.</i>

31:19.544 --> 31:22.088
<i>Eight-cylinder engine, 103 horsepower,</i>

31:22.171 --> 31:25.550
<i>zero to forty in under three minutes, </i>
<i>and...</i>

31:26.426 --> 31:27.760
<i>surprisingly affordable.</i>

31:28.219 --> 31:30.847
<i>A few of these deluxe ceremonies a week,</i>

31:30.930 --> 31:33.600
<i>a couple of sacred objects here and there,</i>

31:33.683 --> 31:35.727
<i>and I'm cruising the open road by summer.</i>

31:35.810 --> 31:40.315
<i>You killed Stompanato and then you stole</i>
<i>my friend Lilith's very special ring,</i>

31:40.398 --> 31:43.735
<i>so forget the open road.</i>
<i>The only place you're going is downtown.</i>

31:43.818 --> 31:45.069
<i>Hold the line there, pal.</i>

31:45.737 --> 31:47.614
<i>Are you talking about the ring of Lilith?</i>

31:47.697 --> 31:48.990
<i>Because my clients...</i>

31:49.073 --> 31:54.120
<i>uh, </i>parishioners,<i> would pay top dollar</i>
<i>for even a slightly passable fake.</i>

31:54.203 --> 31:55.413
<i>We could split the profits.</i>

31:55.496 --> 31:58.333
<i>Objects of immortality are my bestsellers.</i>

31:58.416 --> 32:01.961
<i>Right. Can any of your "parishioners"</i>
<i>account for your whereabouts</i>

32:02.045 --> 32:03.338
<i>from noon to 6:00 today?</i>

32:03.421 --> 32:04.756
<i>Well, sure, I was here.</i>

32:04.839 --> 32:06.841
<i>I did four tarot card readings...</i>

32:07.258 --> 32:08.509
<i>uh, an exorcism...</i>

32:09.510 --> 32:11.554
<i>and a bar mitzvah.</i>

32:11.638 --> 32:13.973
<i>-Oh...</i>
<i>-Tony Stompanato's heart was ripped out</i>

32:14.057 --> 32:16.100
<i>in an identical manner</i>
<i>to your little chicken scam,</i>

32:16.184 --> 32:18.061
<i>so if it wasn't you that killed him,</i>

32:18.144 --> 32:19.646
<i>it had to be one of your customers.</i>

32:19.729 --> 32:22.190
<i>Did you tell any of them</i>
<i>about the ring of Lilith?</i>

32:22.273 --> 32:25.735
<i>Well, sure. I've been selling maps</i>
<i>to Lilith's tomb for years, but...</i>

32:26.319 --> 32:28.821
<i>I couldn't tell you who bought them</i>
<i>on account of all the robes.</i>

32:29.364 --> 32:33.242
<i>[sighs] Well, </i>
<i>that was a clucking waste of time.</i>

32:36.245 --> 32:38.873
<i>I'm afraid we've hit a dead end.</i>

32:39.332 --> 32:41.960
<i>Found a few heart puns,</i>
<i>had a few laughs, but...</i>

32:42.835 --> 32:45.296
<i>it seems you'll have to live</i>
<i>without your ring.</i>

32:46.756 --> 32:50.593
<i>So, why don't I repay my debt</i>
<i>some other way?</i>

32:52.178 --> 32:56.224
<i>A castle, a private island,</i>
<i>a mountain of gold?</i>

32:56.599 --> 32:59.727
<i>The world is your oyster,</i>
<i>and I, your concierge.</i>

33:01.813 --> 33:03.731
<i>Thousands of years, Lucifer,</i>

33:04.440 --> 33:06.943
<i>and that ring has always been with me.</i>

33:07.860 --> 33:10.029
<i>It reminds me of who I am,</i>

33:10.738 --> 33:13.324
<i>why I have done the things I've done.</i>

33:14.450 --> 33:16.786
<i>You mean, why you sent</i>
<i>your children to Hell?</i>

33:17.620 --> 33:19.372
<i>I gave you an army!</i>

33:19.455 --> 33:21.666
<i>An army I never asked for.</i>

33:22.333 --> 33:23.167
<i>And...</i>

33:23.626 --> 33:25.837
<i>one I didn't know I needed at the time.</i>

33:28.047 --> 33:31.968
<i>But... without them I would have spent</i>
<i>eternity alone, and...</i>

33:32.719 --> 33:35.304
<i>for that, I shall be forever in your debt.</i>

33:36.848 --> 33:40.560
<i>Which is why I'm truly sorry</i>
<i>I couldn't get your ring back.</i>

33:45.023 --> 33:46.190
<i>So am I.</i>

33:48.067 --> 33:49.068
<i>[Lucifer sighs]</i>

33:49.444 --> 33:50.278
<i>So...</i>

33:51.154 --> 33:54.073
<i>How exactly did everyone get the idea</i>

33:54.157 --> 33:56.451
<i>it's the ring that makes you immortal,</i>
<i>anyway?</i>

33:57.076 --> 33:57.952
<i>Hmm?</i>

33:59.871 --> 34:00.872
<i>Uh...</i>

34:01.539 --> 34:05.168
<i>So I hitch a ride through the Americas</i>
<i>with this explorer,</i>

34:05.376 --> 34:06.753
<i>Hernán Cortés,</i>

34:06.836 --> 34:10.882
<i>obsessed with gold, rains bloodshed</i>
<i>and terror wherever he goes.</i>

34:10.965 --> 34:11.966
<i>A real wet blanket.</i>

34:13.009 --> 34:19.766
<i>I split the second we hit land and hook up</i>
<i>with this strapping Aztec warrior.</i>

34:20.641 --> 34:21.768
<i>Montezuma.</i>

34:23.519 --> 34:27.190
<i>We have a few drinks,</i>
<i>he asks if I'm a virgin.</i>

34:27.440 --> 34:31.402
<i>I say yes because that always got</i>
<i>the folks in Spain going.</i>

34:31.861 --> 34:33.488
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>-Next thing I know,</i>

34:33.571 --> 34:36.157
<i>some priest fellas</i>
<i>are throwing me in a volcano.</i>

34:36.657 --> 34:37.950
<i>I survive, and...</i>

34:38.576 --> 34:42.038
<i>somebody writes it on a stone tablet.</i>
<i>You know how these things start.</i>

34:42.121 --> 34:44.248
<i>[laughs] I do.</i>

34:44.749 --> 34:46.125
<i>[sighs] Mortals.</i>

34:46.834 --> 34:49.378
<i>Wouldn't mind seeing the look</i>
<i>on that thief's face</i>

34:49.462 --> 34:52.632
<i>when they realize that</i>
<i>that ring doesn't do a damn thing.</i>

34:52.715 --> 34:53.549
<i>Hold on.</i>

34:54.801 --> 34:56.761
<i>The ring doesn't work,</i>

34:57.553 --> 35:00.681
<i>which means the thief will be looking</i>
<i>for a way to make it work.</i>

35:03.226 --> 35:06.521
<i>Lilith, I believe I've found a way</i>
<i>to get your ring back.</i>

35:07.438 --> 35:11.067
<i>All we need is a high priest, a jeweler,</i>
<i>and a distraction.</i>

35:17.824 --> 35:20.993
<i>Thanks to a certain high priest-</i>
<i>cum-magic school freshman I know,</i>

35:21.077 --> 35:22.912

48:51.345 --> 48:52.804
<i>My children are perfect.</i>

48:53.972 --> 48:54.848
<i>They can't be...</i>

48:55.766 --> 48:57.893
<i>banished, because they have no home.</i>

48:58.644 --> 49:01.438
<i>Can't be abandoned,</i>
<i>because they have no family.</i>

49:01.939 --> 49:04.691
<i>They'll never be cast out</i>
<i>of the proverbial garden.</i>

49:04.775 --> 49:07.110
<i>You can never tell them</i>
<i>what I've done today, Lucifer.</i>

49:09.529 --> 49:11.615
<i>Not if they are going to be unbreakable.</i>

49:12.658 --> 49:13.951
<i>Well, you have my word.</i>

49:15.827 --> 49:16.703
<i>Well...</i>

49:17.245 --> 49:19.122
<i>I never thought I'd say this, but...</i>

49:20.207 --> 49:21.708

49:22.167 --> 49:23.210

49:28.840 --> 49:29.925

50:57.012 --> 50:58.680
<i>[scoffs] Don't exaggerate.</i>

51:07.355 --> 51:08.732
<i>You got the story?</i>

51:16.948 --> 51:18.575
<i>I taught you well, kid.</i>

51:22.996 --> 51:25.874
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

<i>Mazikeen.</i>

52:26.518 --> 52:30.438
<i>Lucifer told you that I was here,</i>

52:32.023 --> 52:35.777
<i>You'd think the Devil would be better</i>
<i>at keeping his trap shut.</i>

52:35.861 --> 52:38.280
<i>No, I found you all on my own.</i>

52:38.363 --> 52:39.239
<i>Have you...</i>

52:40.157 --> 52:41.783
<i>been here all this time?</i>

52:42.367 --> 52:44.911
<i>I gave something a shot.</i>
<i>It didn't work out.</i>

52:45.996 --> 52:46.872
<i>That's it?</i>

52:47.414 --> 52:49.082

52:50.333 --> 52:51.585

52:53.420 --> 52:55.172
<i>I wanted to come and see you.</i>

52:59.968 --> 53:02.262
<i>I wanted to know why you abandoned us.</i>

53:04.222 --> 53:05.640
<i>Why you abandoned me.</i>

53:07.392 --> 53:10.270
<i>I did it to make you strong,</i>
<i>and it worked.</i>

53:11.646 --> 53:13.106
<i>Just look at you.</i>

53:13.940 --> 53:17.569
<i>I can see you don't need anyone.</i>

53:24.201 --> 53:25.035
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:26.578 --> 53:27.412
<i>Look at me.</i>
