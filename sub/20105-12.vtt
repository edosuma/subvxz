00:01.169 --> 00:02.629
<i>Previously on</i> iZombie...

00:02.837 --> 00:04.381
Weckler didn't commit suicide.
He was murdered.

00:04.589 --> 00:05.590
Remember the
phone call from prison?

00:05.799 --> 00:08.551
Weckler asked Tatum, "Are they
keeping you well-fed?"
In brains.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.637
Who would most want to
keep Weckler quiet,

00:10.845 --> 00:13.223
but also know how to best
threaten his zombie daughter?

00:13.431 --> 00:14.307
Baracus.

00:14.516 --> 00:15.350
<i>We did it!</i>

00:15.517 --> 00:16.977
Seattle has a zombie mayor.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.062
Let me give you this.
It'll turn you human again.

00:19.646 --> 00:21.690
Harley and his people
are targeting zombies.

00:21.898 --> 00:23.858
Any update on your
"wingnuts who believe
in zombies" story?

00:24.067 --> 00:25.860
You might want to make
some room on the front page.

00:28.613 --> 00:29.656
Oh, my God.

00:34.202 --> 00:38.581
You took everything!
My brothers. All dead!
All gone!

00:38.790 --> 00:41.334
Were you satisfied? No.

00:42.293 --> 00:44.921
- Finally.
- You made me a monster,
you dirty brain eaters!

00:45.213 --> 00:46.214
I came as soon as I could.

00:46.965 --> 00:47.590
Did you bring it?

00:47.799 --> 00:48.717
I'm not one of you!

00:49.384 --> 00:51.553
Why not just kill me? Huh?

00:53.054 --> 00:54.389
What're you waiting for?

00:54.597 --> 00:55.515
You're sick.

00:55.724 --> 00:57.225
You people are monsters!

00:58.560 --> 00:59.978
Finally.

01:00.186 --> 01:01.563
Sorry. Rush hour.

01:12.157 --> 01:14.325
Oh, you think
'cause I'm a zombie now,
I'm gonna eat brains?

01:14.534 --> 01:16.745
No, sir.

01:16.953 --> 01:18.079
No, sir!

01:18.997 --> 01:20.040
Okie dokie.

01:32.719 --> 01:34.220
Did you bring us
everything we asked for?

01:34.679 --> 01:36.473
Yeah. But why not just
take him to Fillmore-Graves?

01:36.681 --> 01:37.515
They'll know
how to handle him.

01:37.724 --> 01:40.602
I'd rather leave our friends
at Fillmore-Graves out of it
until we know more.

01:41.478 --> 01:43.980
His brothers are all dead,
the bunker's hidden.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.067
He should be okay in here,

01:47.233 --> 01:48.818
until we figure out
something better.

01:48.985 --> 01:49.986
Let's do this.

01:58.870 --> 02:01.831
Where've you been?
I've had to do all this
county paperwork myself.

02:02.040 --> 02:06.336
Just tracking Harley Johns
to his secret outhouse bunker,

02:06.544 --> 02:11.633
realizing he turned into
a zombie, and subduing him,
stashing him in a freezer...

02:11.841 --> 02:12.967
Ah. Well...

02:14.427 --> 02:15.929
I did the paperwork.

02:16.387 --> 02:20.308
And, before
you get too comfortable,
you should probably see this.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.728
Oh, my gosh. Is that me?

02:24.646 --> 02:25.605
How?

02:27.023 --> 02:28.691
How to identify us,
all the signs?

02:28.900 --> 02:30.401
White hair, pale skin.

02:31.361 --> 02:32.487
How did they get this?

02:33.321 --> 02:37.909
My understanding
is that reporters have
certain secret sources,

02:38.118 --> 02:39.994
"deep background",
I believe the term is.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.163
I'm on the cover.

02:42.372 --> 02:45.542
On the bright side,
things can't possibly
get any worse.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.586
Ravi, have you seen this
zombie thing in the paper?

02:49.337 --> 02:50.421
Ravi? You here?

02:53.133 --> 02:55.969
Oh, Katty,
I was just coming out
to start on this fellow.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.972
You see this?
Zombies, in Seattle?

02:59.597 --> 03:01.850
Well, uh, it's the alt weekly.

03:02.058 --> 03:04.811
Last year they did
an expose on Juggalos.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.104
Which are a real thing.

03:06.312 --> 03:07.480
This is tinhat stuff.

03:07.981 --> 03:08.898
We need to talk.

03:09.107 --> 03:10.066
Privately.

03:13.194 --> 03:16.948
At first, I just skimmed
the article, you know,
for my own amusement.

03:17.157 --> 03:18.908
But then this one thing...

03:19.075 --> 03:20.660
...jumped out at me...

03:20.869 --> 03:21.786
You all right?

03:21.995 --> 03:23.538
Old Quidditch injury.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.123
I want to discuss this.

03:25.874 --> 03:28.376
"According to
a source in the
medical examiner's office

03:28.585 --> 03:30.837
"who saw bodies
from the party firsthand..."

03:31.337 --> 03:32.505
- Ravi?
- Mmm?

03:33.173 --> 03:34.883
It's obviously you.

03:35.091 --> 03:37.886
Why would you be a source
in this absurd story?

03:38.094 --> 03:41.514
This is exactly
what got you fired
from the CDC.

03:41.723 --> 03:44.976
Pouring gasoline
on the fires of these
crazy fringe theories.

03:45.185 --> 03:47.312
When I spoke to the reporter,

03:47.520 --> 03:49.564
I was speaking
in the abstract.

03:49.772 --> 03:51.566
- No, I never thought...
- We have more cases

03:51.774 --> 03:54.027
of Aleutian flu
here every day.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.696
We could be looking
at a truly horrific
public health crisis.

03:56.905 --> 03:58.114
A real one.

03:58.323 --> 03:59.616
- Well, I...
- Think!

04:01.284 --> 04:02.869
That's all.
I'll show myself out.

04:11.002 --> 04:12.962
You were a source
for the story?

04:14.422 --> 04:15.673
It's complicated.

04:17.008 --> 04:19.344
Well, now things
can't get any worse.

04:20.094 --> 04:20.970
I sat in...

04:31.814 --> 04:32.857
You wanted to see me, sir?

04:33.066 --> 04:34.025
Major.

04:36.277 --> 04:36.945
Sit.

04:37.904 --> 04:38.988
Join me for lunch.

04:48.957 --> 04:49.666
Hmm.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.043
You haven't lived
until you've had these

04:52.252 --> 04:54.671
gourmet brain tubes made
especially for the top brass.

05:06.057 --> 05:07.809
See. Now you know.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.270
We eat the same nasty
brain sludge as everyone else.

05:12.605 --> 05:13.773
I never doubted it, sir.

05:13.982 --> 05:15.358
I'm just not hungry.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.526
Mmm.

05:20.405 --> 05:21.531
The Internet, huh?

05:22.073 --> 05:23.574
Weird to think
there was a time
when people didn't post

05:23.783 --> 05:25.702
all the details of their lives
for everyone to see.

05:26.327 --> 05:29.664
Yes, sir,
I remember it. Vaguely.

05:29.872 --> 05:32.917
And take this, uh,
shameless local girl,
for instance.

05:34.419 --> 05:35.795
<i>Sex Tent</i>. A Haiku.

05:37.005 --> 05:38.464
"We built a sex tent.

05:38.673 --> 05:40.174
"We did it in the sex tent.

05:40.633 --> 05:41.926
"Then we did it some more."

05:42.385 --> 05:44.387
Not even
a proper haiku, is it?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.473
Sir, I ended that.

05:47.807 --> 05:49.183
Wise, but not the point.

05:49.934 --> 05:53.104
From Shawna's ramblings,
it seems you had an intimate
relationship with a human,

05:54.731 --> 05:56.316
and she did not turn
into a zombie.

05:57.275 --> 05:58.901
So, either you discovered
a revolutionary

05:59.110 --> 06:00.361
form of prophylaxis,

06:02.530 --> 06:03.281
or you're human.

06:08.828 --> 06:09.954
Anyone else here know this?

06:10.163 --> 06:11.205
No one, sir.

06:11.706 --> 06:12.790
Look, I just wanted to serve.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.459
What you want doesn't matter.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.754
What matters is that
you've put zombies at risk

06:17.920 --> 06:19.380
every time you went
out into the field.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.176
It's not something
I can allow to continue.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.512
You are no longer an employee
of Fillmore-Graves,
effective immediately.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.097
Sir,

06:28.848 --> 06:30.224
I am sorry.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.226
Put me at a desk.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.603
I'll mop the floor.

06:34.604 --> 06:37.190
It's just, this is my family.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.653
Thank you for your service.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.261
So, is it true?

07:10.014 --> 07:10.723
You're human?

07:11.099 --> 07:11.849
Yeah.

07:13.267 --> 07:13.976
I'm sorry.

07:14.185 --> 07:15.353
What'd I always say?

07:16.521 --> 07:18.815
Major Lillywhite is a bad man.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.442
Stuff you did and you're
not even bulletproof?

07:21.859 --> 07:23.319
Sucks, man.
You might be human,

07:23.528 --> 07:24.529
but you're one of
the good ones.

07:24.779 --> 07:26.364
We're not gonna
let you go quietly, man.

07:26.572 --> 07:27.824
You're gonna get
a proper send-off.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.785
Squad house, Friday,

07:30.952 --> 07:31.994
farewell bash for the ages.

07:32.203 --> 07:33.788
- You in?
- I'm in.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.796
I can't stop
thinking about Baracus.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.714
And a fine morning to you.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.467
Everything points to him
playing a part
in Weckler's death.

07:46.676 --> 07:50.221
There are 20 men
on that dominatrix tape
who haven't been identified.

07:50.430 --> 07:52.473
There's a chance
Baracus had nothing
to do with it.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.100
But what if he did?

07:54.267 --> 07:55.893
And the guy running
Seattle right now is a guy

07:56.102 --> 08:00.148
who turns kids into zombies
and blackmails their parents.

08:00.356 --> 08:01.899
It's not like
we can arrest him.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.651
We could freeze him.

08:04.193 --> 08:04.819
Yeah?

08:05.319 --> 08:06.487
We're not freezing the mayor.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.158
Conspiracy theory brain
must be wearing off.

08:10.366 --> 08:11.951
You're being very reasonable.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.995
I'm more concerned with
the fact that I'm currently

08:14.203 --> 08:16.289
on the cover
of Seattle's alt weekly

08:16.539 --> 08:19.876
with red eyes and rage veins
bulging out of my face.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.044
I'm Seattle's only
identifiable zombie.

08:22.253 --> 08:24.213
No, you're not identifiable.

08:24.422 --> 08:26.591
People look at you
and all they see is gorgeous.

08:27.133 --> 08:30.261
That looks like
a picture of a monster.

08:31.179 --> 08:32.930
- You know
that's still me, right?
- Sorry...

08:33.181 --> 08:35.057
I mean, it's not
a great picture but...

08:35.266 --> 08:37.059
- Monster?
- A cute monster.

08:41.105 --> 08:42.398
Someone's running late today.

08:42.607 --> 08:43.900
<i>Yes. But that someone is now</i>

08:44.108 --> 08:46.110
<i>out front at the coffee cart
and ready to take your order.</i>

08:46.319 --> 08:47.612
Forgiven.

08:47.820 --> 08:51.073
I'll have a triple, full fat,
chai latte with light foam
and extra cinnamon.

08:51.282 --> 08:52.200
Thank you.

08:52.408 --> 08:53.409
<i>You're the worst. Bye.</i>

08:53.618 --> 08:57.872
My small black coffee
with a side of sugar
packets seems lame now.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.290
It was already lame.

09:00.041 --> 09:02.293
I couldn't tell you
that I was a reporter, Ravi.

09:02.502 --> 09:04.003
But I did keep
your name out of it,

09:04.212 --> 09:06.672
despite intense pressure
from my editor
to name my source.

09:06.881 --> 09:08.716
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:08.925 --> 09:09.884
I was being sarcastic.

09:10.301 --> 09:11.052
I know.

09:11.260 --> 09:14.680
But can you see how
reporting that zombies
are wandering around Seattle

09:14.931 --> 09:16.641
seemed more important
than your feelings?

09:16.849 --> 09:17.683
It's not about my feelings.

09:17.892 --> 09:18.893
It's all about your feelings.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.436
You used me.

09:20.978 --> 09:21.771
See?

09:22.146 --> 09:23.064
You need to leave.

09:23.314 --> 09:24.649
Please, Ravi.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.236
I've got just a couple
more questions.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.071
Oh, my God!

09:30.279 --> 09:31.531
Maybe five.

09:32.365 --> 09:33.950
I'm freaked out here.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.035
I came face to face
with that zombie girl,

09:36.244 --> 09:37.620
the one that
we put on our cover.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.914
I thought that she was
going to eat my face off.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.333
I really need you
to leave right now.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.877
This door leads out
to the loading dock.
Just follow the signs.

09:45.086 --> 09:47.296
We're not supposed
to have visitors.
It's not hygienic.

09:47.505 --> 09:49.215
Isn't everybody already dead?

09:49.382 --> 09:50.508
Good morning, princess!

09:50.716 --> 09:52.176
I got your triple,
candy-ass latte.

09:52.385 --> 09:53.928
Don't be pissy
about me being late.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.139
Oh, thank God.

09:57.348 --> 09:58.641
I got caught
in a primp spiral.

10:00.142 --> 10:00.893
Hi.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.520
Oh, this is Rachel.

10:02.728 --> 10:05.606
- Rachel, this is my colleague,
Olivia Moore.
- Rachel the reporter?

10:07.066 --> 10:08.734
Seems my reputation
precedes me.

10:09.944 --> 10:11.153
Oh, we have a body.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.072
Sorry. Duty calls.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.532
I'll call you later.

10:15.032 --> 10:15.866
Please don't.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.253
To clarify,
you were by the dumpster,
you saw the body?

10:27.461 --> 10:29.088
In, we were in the dumpster.

10:29.964 --> 10:31.549
So, you two
are homeless, or...

10:31.757 --> 10:32.883
We're freegans.

10:34.969 --> 10:37.597
Up to 50% of US food
is wasted,

10:37.763 --> 10:40.808
despite being quite edible,
so what we do is, we...

10:41.017 --> 10:42.893
So, in the garbage.

10:43.603 --> 10:44.812
And then you saw the body?

10:45.021 --> 10:49.150
I felt. I was climbing out,
and I touched something
like a wig, but...

10:49.358 --> 10:50.651
Get their info, will you?

10:50.860 --> 10:51.777
You got it.

11:02.747 --> 11:04.665
So, this is what
you look like.

11:04.874 --> 11:06.709
It's what I look like
with a layer of paint

11:06.917 --> 11:08.294
and this uncomfortable wig,

11:08.502 --> 11:09.754
so don't get used to it.

11:10.004 --> 11:12.006
Just with me being
the alt weekly cover girl.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.175
- The what?
- I'll show you later.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.343
What've we got?

11:16.010 --> 11:17.720
They found her
behind a dumpster.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.764
She had a couple
superficial stab wounds,

11:20.014 --> 11:21.057
but cause of death looks like

11:21.265 --> 11:22.808
blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

11:23.017 --> 11:24.602
So, like a mugging
gone wrong, or?

11:24.810 --> 11:26.979
Her credit cards,
cash, are all there.

11:27.188 --> 11:29.565
And, it's a head wound,
but there's no blood
near the body.

11:29.774 --> 11:33.319
My guess is
she was killed elsewhere,
killer dropped her here.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.695
She had a keycard
for the hotel

11:34.904 --> 11:36.656
around the corner
in her pocket,

11:36.864 --> 11:39.992
so it's possible
she's not a local.

11:42.995 --> 11:45.122
She's not local.
She's from Atlanta.

11:46.374 --> 11:48.209
That's my old boss,
Katty Kupps.

11:59.387 --> 12:00.429
You okay?

12:01.055 --> 12:03.182
My therapist will have
to make that call.

12:03.432 --> 12:08.187
And I've never
performed an autopsy
with someone I've slept with.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.232
But, you know,
I've done my job.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.360
What was she like?
Anything weird?

12:14.527 --> 12:17.863
You know, driven,
direct, nothing weird.
You've had worse.

12:18.072 --> 12:19.699
That's your
glowing endorsement?

12:19.907 --> 12:21.158
You slept with this woman.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.535
It was a grudge-boink.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.953
Although, um...

12:24.537 --> 12:27.164
You should know,
you might find yourself...

12:28.207 --> 12:29.166
Attracted to me.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.002
So much for nothing weird.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.979
We just checked out
Ms. Kupps' hotel room.

12:50.479 --> 12:53.649
Guess she was in town
working on this
Aleutian flu outbreak,

12:53.858 --> 12:58.362
so, Liv Moore,
Ravi Chakrabarti,
Meg Nevins, CDC.

12:58.571 --> 13:00.865
I asked her to brief us
on what Katty was doing here.

13:01.741 --> 13:02.450
Right.

13:02.742 --> 13:05.911
Katty was doing in-person
epidemiological data assembly,

13:06.120 --> 13:08.914
tracking a probable vector
of the Aleutian flu cluster.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.586
Doing interviews,
tracking the spread
of the virus.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.546
Probable vector?
So, you know how it got here?

13:15.755 --> 13:19.717
We traced the first cases
to an Air Liberte flight
from Paris to SeaTac.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.094
Our team's been interviewing
everyone on the flight.

13:22.303 --> 13:25.097
Ms. Kupps was tracking
passengers in first class.

13:25.306 --> 13:28.017
According to her record,
she had four left.

13:28.225 --> 13:32.438
Now, unless you have
any further questions
specific to Ms. Kupps,

13:32.646 --> 13:34.315
I have work to do. Good day.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.321
I've got Ms. Kupps' notes
that were left in her room.

13:40.905 --> 13:44.992
Hmm. Lots of notes
on cocktail napkins
from the hotel bar.

13:45.409 --> 13:48.287
So, if I understood correctly,
and it's possible I didn't,

13:48.537 --> 13:50.748
on the last day she was alive,
Ms. Kupps should've been

13:50.956 --> 13:54.126
interviewing the four
people in first class
she hadn't gotten to yet.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.254
We need to put together
a timeline of her last day.

13:57.713 --> 14:02.718
We got the passenger list,
lots of cryptic notes,

14:02.927 --> 14:07.264
including this one, "170."
What can that mean?

14:08.265 --> 14:11.268
D, 17D, a seat number?

14:11.477 --> 14:14.230
You know, our CDC friend
isn't telling us everything.

14:14.772 --> 14:18.651
I mean, A, the Aleutian flu
was considered dormant
until this outbreak.

14:18.859 --> 14:23.322
B, if Paris was the origin,
there'd be an active outbreak,
just like here.

14:23.572 --> 14:24.490
Are you saying...

14:24.657 --> 14:27.660
I'm saying the CDC fears

14:27.868 --> 14:30.287
this outbreak has been
caused by bio-terrorism.

14:30.496 --> 14:31.705
Bio-terrorism?

14:31.914 --> 14:33.749
Not definitely bio-terrorism.

14:33.958 --> 14:36.794
Just, you know,
possibly bio-terrorism.

14:37.002 --> 14:40.172
Okay, Ravi, I'm gonna need you
to sit in on these interviews.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.882
We'll need
your expertise on this.

14:42.091 --> 14:43.050
Right. Of course.

14:44.093 --> 14:45.511
Bio-terrorism.

14:47.388 --> 14:52.560
You know,
I'm not sure what time
the CDC lady showed up,

14:52.768 --> 14:56.063
but I know I asked her
to leave at 2:50.

14:56.272 --> 14:57.439
You asked her to leave?

14:57.731 --> 15:01.485
I needed time
to make my tea before
my news program started.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.612
I love that Shepard Smith.

15:03.821 --> 15:06.574
Those bedroom eyes.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.994
Can you tell us anything
about Dr. Kupps's demeanor?

15:10.244 --> 15:12.371
She was fine.

15:12.580 --> 15:13.873
A little standoffish.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.875
I was the one who was anxious.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.669
The thought that I was sitting
right next to a person

15:18.878 --> 15:20.629
who had those germs.

15:21.255 --> 15:22.631
Every time I get
a little tickle

15:22.840 --> 15:26.218
in the back of my throat,
I think, "This is it."

15:26.385 --> 15:27.928
You have a tickle
in your throat?

15:28.095 --> 15:29.722
Well, I get
a little dry sometimes.

15:33.684 --> 15:36.353
Have some water.
Give her some water.

15:36.562 --> 15:40.024
Do you happen to remember
any of the questions
Dr. Kupps asked you?

15:40.274 --> 15:42.735
She asked if
I ate the in-flight meal,

15:42.943 --> 15:47.990
what I drank,
if I had ice in my drink,
if I used the lavatory...

15:48.198 --> 15:50.451
Did she ask if you used
the soap in the lavatory?

15:50.659 --> 15:51.911
Please.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.787
We had a full
10 minutes on the soap.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.831
When investigating
an outbreak like this,

15:56.040 --> 15:58.459
it's imperative
that the CDC is extremely...

16:03.505 --> 16:04.715
Yeah? You like that?

16:04.924 --> 16:05.966
Oh, yeah.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.386
Oh!

16:10.596 --> 16:12.765
What? Is there a spider?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.184
Is it on me?

16:18.187 --> 16:19.063
Dead kittens.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.690
Winston Churchill
eating fried chicken.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.234
Flatulent Jabba the Hutt.

16:29.949 --> 16:30.950
Are you okay?

16:31.116 --> 16:33.786
Oh, please, for the love of
all things good and holy,
just make this stop.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.079
Is it a migraine, honey?

16:35.329 --> 16:36.330
I wish.

16:37.206 --> 16:38.248
Did you just have a...

16:39.500 --> 16:40.334
Was I in there?

16:42.878 --> 16:45.297
Can we just get this
over with, please?

16:45.506 --> 16:46.757
Dr. Chakrabarti.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.425
Maybe you should
continue with your questions

16:48.676 --> 16:50.427
while Dr. Moore
collects herself.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.354
Did Ms. Kupps ask you
about the other passengers?

17:00.562 --> 17:02.314
If you saw anyone
carrying anything odd?

17:02.523 --> 17:03.524
Yes.

17:04.108 --> 17:06.735
And I told her about
the man sitting next to me.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.947
He was very suspicious.

17:10.406 --> 17:11.573
How so?

17:12.366 --> 17:16.954
Well, he was one of those,
you know...

17:17.830 --> 17:23.002
Like you,
and he had one of those
whoosie-whatsits on his head.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.628
A whoosie-whatsit?

17:24.795 --> 17:28.007
One of those
Muslim thingamabobs.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.134
Like Norma Desmond
in <i>Sunset Boulevard.</i>

17:30.384 --> 17:32.678
So, by whoosie-whatsit
you mean turban.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.263
By Muslim you mean Sikh.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.807
And by like me you mean brown.

17:37.057 --> 17:37.933
Yes.

17:38.142 --> 17:38.934
Wow.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.854
Was there anything
he actually did
that concerned you?

17:43.480 --> 17:47.609
You know, he just
seemed like a person

17:47.818 --> 17:50.446
with no regard for human life.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.532
Yes, yes, yes.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.411
I just have to
bounce a little.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.038
Sorry. Is that
too distracting?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.080
It's fine.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.125
So, Ms. Kupps left your place
around 11:00 a.m.?

18:03.292 --> 18:04.251
I think that's right.

18:05.544 --> 18:06.462
Can I just get my notes?

18:06.670 --> 18:07.838
Stay back there.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.633
Uh, did she ask
about your fellow passengers?

18:11.842 --> 18:15.679
If anyone used anything,
like, say, an asthma inhaler
or perfume?

18:15.888 --> 18:16.805
Yeah, she asked me all that.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.515
But, like I told her,
the only thing of note

18:18.766 --> 18:21.435
was that there was
this little barking dog.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.062
Oh. And when
I took off my shoes,

18:23.228 --> 18:24.980
the lady beside me
freaked out.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.026
Thanks for your time.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.403
Yes, yes, yes.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.238
I already filed, Ed.
And, I have...

18:34.948 --> 18:36.575
My own problems.

18:36.784 --> 18:37.951
I'll call you back.

18:38.911 --> 18:39.953
Floyd?

18:40.496 --> 18:41.371
Have you seen this?

18:42.414 --> 18:43.415
It's the alt weekly.

18:43.749 --> 18:44.792
This is the beginning.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.087
I'm sorry? Mr. Mayor,
the beginning of what?

18:49.588 --> 18:52.216
Let's not pretend that
you're not in the loop.

18:53.092 --> 18:54.093
Zombies.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.348
Bit by bit, now,
the secret will leak out
and we need to prepare.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.350
Oh. We?

19:01.558 --> 19:03.102
Peyton, I'm now
mayor of a city

19:03.268 --> 19:05.771
on the verge of learning
that zombies are real.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.233
We may also be ground zero
to a deadly pandemic.

19:09.441 --> 19:13.070
And, I need people
who understand the nature
of the task ahead.

19:14.947 --> 19:16.490
I need you
to be my chief of staff.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.035
It's a flattering offer.

19:20.244 --> 19:24.456
But I... I love the work I do
here in the DA's office.

19:24.665 --> 19:27.209
I, uh... I found a new angle
on the Weckler case.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.003
The daughter might have
useful information for us.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.005
Fine.

19:32.589 --> 19:37.678
Uh, if you do find those
missing videos of that
dominatrix's sessions,

19:37.886 --> 19:40.347
don't be surprised
if you see me on them.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.977
Yeah. Just saying.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.147
Yeah, take a couple of days,
think it over.

19:48.355 --> 19:52.359
Chief of staff to the mayor
of a major American city
before you're 30.

19:52.568 --> 19:55.571
That beats assistant
district attorney, doesn't it?

20:11.670 --> 20:12.880
No way.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.323
Oh, come on. Like I'd be seen

20:39.531 --> 20:41.783
at the Space Needle
with Chaos Killer.

20:50.083 --> 20:55.005
So, some fame-hungry floozy
reminds all of Seattle
why they hate you,

20:55.214 --> 20:57.382
and then this zombie
army outfit that's like

20:57.591 --> 20:59.676
your only family,
throws you out

20:59.885 --> 21:01.762
because this floozy
outed you as a human?

21:02.304 --> 21:04.389
Pretty much covers it.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.099
That's terrible.

21:07.601 --> 21:08.936
What are you gonna do now?

21:09.853 --> 21:14.191
Well, lately, I've been
really into lying on the couch
and looking up.

21:14.566 --> 21:15.901
Sometimes sideways.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.654
Enough about me,
what about you?

21:20.489 --> 21:24.034
Well, since you liberated me
and gave me the cure,

21:25.285 --> 21:27.287
I've done what I said
I was gonna do.

21:27.496 --> 21:30.165
Traveled the world
looking for a perfect place
to call home.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.416
And I found it.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.293
Italy.

21:33.502 --> 21:34.628
Amalfi Coast.

21:34.836 --> 21:37.381
- Oh.
- I rented a place in Positano.

21:37.589 --> 21:41.593
Six-month lease, as long as
a tourist visa allows.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.053
Sounds fancy.

21:43.262 --> 21:46.890
I may have been
a working girl,
but I was no dummy. I saved.

21:47.099 --> 21:49.268
Like Jamie Lee Curtis
in <i>Trading Places.</i>

21:49.476 --> 21:51.061
- Hmm?
- It was on cable.

21:51.270 --> 21:53.647
Watched it here on the couch.

21:53.855 --> 21:57.109
I just came back
to move the stuff from
my house into storage,

21:57.359 --> 22:01.947
and, of course, to thank you
for what you did for me.

22:04.825 --> 22:09.496
Yeah, and then
I saw the shirt,
and, well, anyway...

22:09.955 --> 22:10.831
Here you are.

22:12.916 --> 22:13.959
Here I am.

22:14.876 --> 22:17.337
Hey, if you need help
moving stuff tomorrow,

22:17.546 --> 22:19.172
I mean, my schedule is...

22:20.799 --> 22:21.633
Wide open?

22:21.842 --> 22:23.302
Yeah, so...

22:23.468 --> 22:24.594
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

22:24.803 --> 22:25.804
Okay.

22:26.096 --> 22:27.764
<i>Good evening.
I'm Johnny Frost.</i>

22:27.973 --> 22:31.768
<i>In the wake of</i> 206 Weekly's
<i>controversial zombie story,</i>

22:31.977 --> 22:36.023
<i>parents in some local schools

22:36.231 --> 22:39.776
<i>until they conduct

22:39.985 --> 22:41.570
<i>What do they say

22:41.778 --> 22:43.488
<i>Discovery Day is coming?</i>

22:43.697 --> 22:45.407
<i>It certainly feels that way.</i>

22:45.574 --> 22:47.367
<i>If Katty's

22:47.576 --> 22:50.954

22:55.375 --> 22:58.128
<i>the least I can do

22:59.171 --> 23:00.547
Hey. What can I get for you?

23:01.715 --> 23:03.050
I'm with the SPD.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.760
I'm looking into the death
of a hotel guest.

23:07.179 --> 23:08.513
Do you recognize this woman?

23:10.098 --> 23:11.308
Sorry. Never seen her before.

23:11.475 --> 23:14.061
But I'm just filling in
for the regular guy
for a couple days.

23:14.269 --> 23:15.354
- Thanks, anyway.
- Yeah.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.110
You know?

23:22.527 --> 23:24.946
I might as well
have a vodka tonic
now that I'm here.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.448
I'm off duty.

23:26.656 --> 23:27.574
Of course.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.584
Feel like some company?

23:40.587 --> 23:41.797
I don't want to travel
all the time,

23:42.005 --> 23:44.049
but that's where the money is.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.677
There's something
kind of cowboy about being
on the road all the time.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.180
I think Bon Jovi
wrote a song about you.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.016
I gotta say, I envy you.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.935
Traveling city to city.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.062
A lot of opportunities
for reinvention.

23:57.687 --> 24:00.232
Chances to try on a whole new
version of yourself.

24:02.067 --> 24:05.028
Excuse me. Last call, guys.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.154
Okay.

24:09.491 --> 24:12.619
You know, I have
a fully-stocked mini-bar.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.914
Why don't you give me
15 minutes and join me.

24:16.123 --> 24:18.041
I need to call my wife,
report on my day.

24:19.418 --> 24:20.544
What's your room number?

24:27.175 --> 24:29.553
<i>What are you doing, Liv?
What are you doing?</i>

24:37.769 --> 24:39.521
<i>Still reaching out
to ya, Harley.</i>

24:39.729 --> 24:42.315
<i>Nobody's been
able to find you,
so give us a shout.</i>

24:42.566 --> 24:43.817
<i>Waiting to know what's what.</i>

24:54.995 --> 24:56.288
Is this how
it's going to be now?

24:56.496 --> 24:57.539
You refusing to even
look at me?

24:57.747 --> 24:59.166
I'm not refusing
to look at you.

24:59.374 --> 25:00.542
Clearly you're being distant.

25:00.709 --> 25:02.252
It's not my fault
we brain-banged.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.463
I'm just having
a weird day, okay?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.465
Most women can't help
thinking about sex
when they look at me.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.675
You'll get used to it.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.012
I have to ask.
Did you see my...

25:12.220 --> 25:13.763
I don't want to talk about it.

25:13.972 --> 25:14.890
I'll take that as a yes.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.016
And you're welcome.

25:17.309 --> 25:19.853
Hey. Peyton, what's up?

25:20.061 --> 25:22.522
So, in news of the weird...

25:22.731 --> 25:24.691
Baracus stopped by
my office yesterday,

25:24.900 --> 25:26.234
asked me to be
his chief of staff.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.028
Whoa. That's huge.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.655
Do you think Baracus
knows you suspect him
in the Weckler case?

25:30.906 --> 25:32.491
Is this his way
of buying you off?

25:32.699 --> 25:33.867
I tested him.

25:34.075 --> 25:35.660
He didn't even blink when
I mentioned Tatum Weckler,

25:35.911 --> 25:37.120
so, if he turned her
into a zombie

25:37.329 --> 25:39.915
to blackmail her father,
he's a world class liar.

25:40.332 --> 25:41.541
I think you should
take the job.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.751
Yeah?

25:42.959 --> 25:45.545
If it turns out
Baracus wasn't complicit
in Weckler's death,

25:45.754 --> 25:48.757
then you can help the city's
first zombie mayor
through a time of crisis.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.301
And if it turns out he was,
you can keep an eye on him,

25:51.510 --> 25:52.677
see what
he's going to do next.

25:57.057 --> 25:59.142
<i>I don't know why
I'm drawn to this place.</i>

25:59.643 --> 26:01.728
<i>It must have something to do
with Katty's murder.</i>

26:01.937 --> 26:03.480
<i>Two hours, no visions.</i>

26:03.688 --> 26:05.982
<i>But still,
I don't want to leave.</i>

26:24.834 --> 26:26.086
You look surprised.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.630
Was buying me a drink a weird
hint to stay at the bar?

26:29.589 --> 26:31.258
No. I just... I...

26:31.466 --> 26:33.927
I thought my fortune
had peaked with
the appreciative smile.

26:34.135 --> 26:36.555
Unless you're a hooker.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.015
Excuse me?

26:39.599 --> 26:42.352
Um... Yeah, it was a joke.

26:44.813 --> 26:45.647
Um...

26:45.855 --> 26:49.067
I mean, I was saying that
that's why you would
talk to me...

26:49.317 --> 26:51.236
Um, looking like you do.

26:52.195 --> 26:53.530
How is it that I look?

26:53.697 --> 26:55.365
Uh, like,
way out of my league.

27:01.496 --> 27:03.957
Oh, yes, um, door open. Uh...

27:04.165 --> 27:05.709
Oh, please, have my card.
Please, have my...

27:05.959 --> 27:07.085
Please, have my key.

27:07.919 --> 27:08.545
Yes!

27:09.379 --> 27:11.673
I just can't. I'm sorry.

27:11.881 --> 27:12.882
You're sorry?

27:19.472 --> 27:20.432
Hey.

27:26.396 --> 27:27.606
Everything okay?

27:28.982 --> 27:30.317
Your text seemed
kind of urgent.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.027
I'm just so happy to see you.

27:32.235 --> 27:32.986
Yeah?

27:33.445 --> 27:36.781
That's more of a welcome back
from a seven-month tour
in Afghanistan hug.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.827
I wanted to ask you something.

27:42.245 --> 27:43.872
What exactly are we?

27:44.080 --> 27:46.333
Oh. Glad you brought that up.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.293
I've been meaning to tell you.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.295
We're zombies.

27:50.879 --> 27:53.131
No, I mean, us. Together.

27:54.299 --> 27:55.592
Are we a couple?

27:55.800 --> 27:56.718
I think so.

27:57.427 --> 27:58.595
Unless you don't think so.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.263
An exclusive couple?

28:00.430 --> 28:02.140
Are you technically a couple
if you're not exclusive?

28:02.349 --> 28:03.516
I don't know.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.561
I think couple
equals exclusive.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.064
I can't believe
you were doubting this.

28:09.272 --> 28:12.734
I've just been feeling
a little uncertain lately.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.195
I haven't had
the best luck with boyfriends.

28:15.403 --> 28:18.823
And I think I may have been
keeping you at arm's length
because of that.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.910
Hmm. Well,
knock that crap off.

28:37.050 --> 28:40.345
How can one person
have that much stuff?

28:41.596 --> 28:43.973
Ah. Now I see why
you tracked me down.

28:45.058 --> 28:46.351
Free manual labor.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.228
Curses. You saw
through my plan.

28:50.730 --> 28:53.233
Oh, you poor fragile thing.

28:53.441 --> 28:54.401
Tell me where it hurts.

28:54.609 --> 28:56.361
- Everywhere.
- Hmm.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.530
I mean, here definitely.

29:04.703 --> 29:05.662
Here.

29:16.423 --> 29:17.340
Here.

29:20.969 --> 29:21.928
Here.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.054
Okay.

29:24.055 --> 29:24.973
Here?

29:25.557 --> 29:28.226
You stole this whole bit
from <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

29:28.435 --> 29:30.562
Yeah, saw it on the couch.

29:30.770 --> 29:31.896
Good movie.

29:40.905 --> 29:41.865
Wow.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.784
I definitely
didn't fake that one.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.580
That's the first time
in years.

29:50.415 --> 29:51.916
I'm glad I could be
a part of it.

29:57.380 --> 29:58.506
Why don't you come with me?

30:02.385 --> 30:03.762
Come away to Positano.

30:03.970 --> 30:04.679
Right.

30:05.305 --> 30:06.639
Why not?

30:06.848 --> 30:08.391
You're just telling me
about your life here,

30:08.600 --> 30:09.893
how people treat you.

30:11.102 --> 30:12.312
What's keeping you here?

30:15.857 --> 30:17.150
When's our flight?

30:17.317 --> 30:18.860
I'm being serious.

30:20.111 --> 30:21.321
Yeah. So am I.

30:22.489 --> 30:23.573
You're right.

30:24.365 --> 30:25.492
I just need to pack.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.827
And my old squad's
throwing me a send-off.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.454
I gotta go to that,
but then...

30:30.955 --> 30:32.040
Why not?

30:47.639 --> 30:49.182
<i>New Seattle
mayor, Floyd Baracus,</i>

30:49.390 --> 30:51.017
<i>has declared
a state of emergency</i>

30:51.267 --> 30:54.145
<i>in response to the spread
of the Aleutian flu,</i>

30:54.354 --> 30:55.605
<i>a condition for which he says</i>

30:55.814 --> 30:58.066
<i>there is a vaccine,
but no known cure.</i>

30:58.274 --> 31:00.360
Big government
to the rescue, huh?

31:00.568 --> 31:02.111
I'm sure
that'll work out fine.

31:03.112 --> 31:04.906
When none of
the Johns brothers showed up
to open Wham Bam's,

31:05.073 --> 31:07.075
I thought for sure
we'd find them out here.

31:07.534 --> 31:10.745
Maybe zombies ate the others
and were saving Harley
for later?

31:12.831 --> 31:15.083
Oh, whatever it is,
he deserves a proper burial.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.709
It's possible
the rest are still alive,

31:16.960 --> 31:18.920
maybe captured, now
the zombies are trying to get

31:19.087 --> 31:20.505
whatever intel they can
out of them.

31:20.672 --> 31:23.424
<i>Beginning Monday,
all Seattle public schools</i>

31:23.675 --> 31:24.843
<i>- will be closed.</i>
- Let's see here.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.928
Look here. We've been tracking

31:27.136 --> 31:30.557
all the Chaos Killer victims
and the bodyguards
protecting them.

31:30.723 --> 31:33.560
Let's get some guys
and hit every location until
we find Harley's brothers.

31:33.768 --> 31:34.686
Starting here.

31:35.019 --> 31:37.230
That's where a bunch
of bodyguards seem to gather.

31:38.273 --> 31:41.317
We humans,
we protect our brothers
until our last dying breath.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.444
I'm all for
helping out, but...

31:44.946 --> 31:46.322
I'm not looking to die.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.366
We all die, Billy.

31:48.575 --> 31:51.035
<i>The mayor's announcement
comes amid growing concern,</i>

31:51.286 --> 31:53.288
<i>believe it or not,
about zombies.</i>

31:53.454 --> 31:55.081
<i>Yes, zombies.</i>

31:55.331 --> 31:57.417
No, that's right.
They're coming
for your brains!

31:57.625 --> 31:58.668
Wake up, sheeple!

32:04.299 --> 32:07.010
All those bar napkins,
we might as well ask around.

32:07.218 --> 32:08.803
Maybe it won't be
a waste of time.

32:09.012 --> 32:11.681
Yeah, but I'm not sure why
you need me to come with you.

32:11.890 --> 32:13.141
You might have a vision.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.268
We've done
this sort of thing a lot.

32:15.476 --> 32:16.394
Excuse me, sir?

32:16.603 --> 32:18.104
What can I get for you folks?

32:18.605 --> 32:20.023
Clive Babineaux, homicide.

32:20.231 --> 32:22.066
This is Liv Moore.
She's a medical examiner.

32:22.275 --> 32:25.111
Right. A murdered lady.
Ms. Kupps.

32:26.571 --> 32:27.530
You knew who she was?

32:28.531 --> 32:29.991
Hey.

32:30.158 --> 32:31.326
I almost didn't recognize you.

32:31.534 --> 32:32.994
You didn't lose a lipstick,
did you?

32:33.202 --> 32:34.120
Pretty gold case?

32:34.329 --> 32:35.538
Nope. Thanks though.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.667
Uh, you were saying
you knew her.

32:39.876 --> 32:42.003
She was memorable. Big tipper.

32:42.211 --> 32:43.796
Hey. You're here early.

32:45.214 --> 32:47.258
I must look like
another customer.

32:49.385 --> 32:53.056
Do you remember if Ms. Kupps
was in the bar Tuesday night,
the night of the murder?

32:53.264 --> 32:54.682
I feel like
she was in here every night,

32:54.891 --> 32:57.018
but I can't be positive
she was here that night.

32:57.226 --> 32:58.895
Oh, think hard.
You said she was memorable.

32:59.062 --> 33:00.313
Was it just because
of the big tips?

33:00.521 --> 33:01.814
No.

33:02.065 --> 33:03.983
No, she was memorable
because she left the bar

33:04.150 --> 33:05.735
with a different man
every single night.

33:06.694 --> 33:08.029
Oh, God.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.990
Do you think you'd be able
to describe any of the men
she left with?

33:11.199 --> 33:13.284
Well, probably four or five.

33:13.493 --> 33:15.787
I want to send
a police sketch artist
over to talk to you.

33:16.204 --> 33:18.206
- Sure.
- I'll contact you
with the details.

33:18.414 --> 33:19.999
- Thank you.
- No problem.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.710
See? Worth a trip.

33:22.919 --> 33:24.295
Hmm. Totally.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.673
A woman who picks up
that many men,

33:26.881 --> 33:29.175
what are the odds one night
she picked the wrong guy?

33:29.884 --> 33:30.969
While we wait
on our sketches,

33:31.177 --> 33:32.804
I've got another one
of the first class passengers

33:33.054 --> 33:34.472
coming to the station later,
you free?

33:34.722 --> 33:35.640
I'm not.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.016
I'm going to a party
with my boyfriend,

33:37.225 --> 33:38.685
and I absolutely
can't miss it.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.024
So, Mr. Edsall...

33:47.527 --> 33:51.364
Ms. Kupps met with you
about the Paris flight?

33:51.572 --> 33:53.616
Yeah. She came by
in the morning.

33:53.866 --> 33:59.414
Asked her questions,
blah blah, CDC stuff,
and she left.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.166
Look, you want to know
what happened on that flight,
talk to my wife.

34:02.375 --> 34:04.794
She sat next to me
the whole time doing nothing.

34:05.461 --> 34:09.507
Wait, according to
the passenger list,
your wife was in coach.

34:09.716 --> 34:12.552
Yeah, there was a screw-up
and they wouldn't
let us upgrade.

34:13.136 --> 34:15.096
So I switched seats with the
girl sitting next to my wife,

34:15.263 --> 34:16.764
so I wouldn't have to listen
to her bitch at me

34:16.931 --> 34:18.933
the whole week
about how I abandoned her.

34:19.142 --> 34:20.893
You switched seats
with a girl...

34:23.146 --> 34:24.230
Let me guess...

34:24.814 --> 34:26.065
In 17D.

34:26.774 --> 34:27.734
Yeah.

34:31.779 --> 34:33.573
Man of the hour! Come on!

34:40.705 --> 34:42.540
All right, um,
everyone, this is Natalie.

34:42.749 --> 34:44.167
Natalie... Everyone.

34:44.375 --> 34:45.626
Natalie!

34:45.835 --> 34:47.128
Must be nice
to be pretty, son.

34:48.421 --> 34:50.089
Hey, uh, so is Liv here yet?

34:50.256 --> 34:52.925
Just texted. Crime stuff,
she's gonna be late.

34:53.176 --> 34:54.218
- All right.
- Drinks. Drinks.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.597
<i>I can't believe
I'm back here.</i>

34:57.805 --> 35:00.058
<i>I should just stand up
right now and go.</i>

35:00.516 --> 35:02.143
<i>I can refuse
this brain's desires...</i>

35:02.351 --> 35:04.812
<i>I can walk out right now.
I have the power.</i>

35:05.480 --> 35:07.774
Oh, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

35:08.441 --> 35:09.942
You finally tanned and dyed.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.072
Mind if I join you?

35:21.996 --> 35:24.624
Okay, 11:00.

35:24.874 --> 35:27.502
Brown-haired lady
with the burgundy cardigan.

35:28.086 --> 35:32.340
Okay. So, she owns
a crafty small business.

35:32.548 --> 35:33.424
Like a knitting store.

35:33.591 --> 35:34.550
A knitting store?

35:34.801 --> 35:36.010
It's a thing.

35:36.219 --> 35:37.887
She sells
knitting supplies like...

35:39.263 --> 35:40.306
- Yarn?
- Exactly.

35:40.556 --> 35:41.641
You had to search for yarn?

35:41.849 --> 35:44.185
Oh, I have had four drinks.

35:44.352 --> 35:45.853
Okay. So, she owns
this knitting store,

35:46.062 --> 35:48.898
and, it's got some
ill-conceived pun for a name,

35:49.107 --> 35:51.234
like Knitpicker, or...

35:51.484 --> 35:52.610
Ittie Bittie
Knittie Committee?

35:52.819 --> 35:53.820
Yes!

35:54.112 --> 35:56.823
And her secret sex fantasy
is being tied up.

35:57.031 --> 35:57.990
With yarn, of course.

35:58.241 --> 35:59.408
No. See, that's the thing.

35:59.617 --> 36:01.536
It's with anything but yarn.

36:01.744 --> 36:02.703
That's her kink.

36:05.039 --> 36:07.375
You know, I bet
they're over there
playing the same game as us.

36:07.583 --> 36:10.795
Oh, look at them.
Trying to guess
our sexual fantasies.

36:11.003 --> 36:13.673
Is this your stealthy way
of asking me about
my sexual fantasies?

36:13.881 --> 36:14.507
No.

36:15.675 --> 36:16.843
What are
your sexual fantasies?

36:17.009 --> 36:17.969
Feel free to get specific.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.303
You first.

36:19.512 --> 36:20.930
Chicken.

36:21.139 --> 36:22.598
Said the man who's stalling.

36:22.807 --> 36:23.933
Okay.

36:27.937 --> 36:30.231
I've been staying
in this hotel since
I got back from Tripoli.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.651
Since then, I've developed
a pretty detailed fantasy

36:33.901 --> 36:35.153
involving the desk
in my suite.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.907
Your sex fantasy
is about furniture?

36:40.116 --> 36:42.535
No. It's about having sex
with a beautiful woman

36:42.743 --> 36:44.495
who is sitting on top
of the furniture.

36:45.997 --> 36:48.166
The desk is right up
against this window
that overlooks the city.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.168
- A bang with a view.
- Yeah.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.336
There's something erotic
about it, actually.

36:53.045 --> 36:55.298
Being intimate,
but on display.

36:57.466 --> 36:58.926
It's also a really nice desk.

37:02.305 --> 37:03.806
Now how am I
supposed to follow that?

37:04.056 --> 37:05.766
Oh, you owe it
to yourself to try.

37:07.101 --> 37:08.186
Okay.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.608
So, I'm completely naked...

37:15.026 --> 37:16.110
Excellent start.

37:18.821 --> 37:19.906
Hey, Babineaux.

37:20.114 --> 37:21.991
You expecting something
from the CDC?

37:22.200 --> 37:24.577
- What is it?
- Fax. No cover.

37:24.785 --> 37:27.288
Passenger ID request
on an Air Liberte flight...

37:27.496 --> 37:29.332
17D? Yeah, that's me.

37:29.540 --> 37:30.791
You seen Harley Johns lately?

37:31.918 --> 37:34.378
Harley Johns? No. Why?

37:34.587 --> 37:37.006
Just... The guy's
basically disappeared.

37:37.215 --> 37:40.092
Whole Johns clan,
just off the map.

37:41.886 --> 37:43.221
That's weird.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.680
Yeah.

37:44.931 --> 37:45.973
It is weird.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.092
Detective?

38:21.300 --> 38:22.677
Babineaux.

38:22.843 --> 38:23.970
Is Patrice here?

38:24.178 --> 38:25.680
And a parent, maybe?

38:25.888 --> 38:28.516
Um, we're not supposed
to have guests this late.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.268
I'm not a guest,
I'm the police.

38:30.434 --> 38:31.394
Could you get Patrice for me?

38:33.312 --> 38:34.522
Hello, Patrice.

38:35.898 --> 38:37.650
I need to ask you
some questions.

38:38.818 --> 38:42.071
You recently flew
from Paris to Seattle
on Air Liberte, correct?

38:42.280 --> 38:43.489
Yeah?

38:43.698 --> 38:44.991
And you changed seats?

38:45.199 --> 38:46.659
Switched with a man
in first class?

38:47.451 --> 38:48.369
Yeah, but I...

38:48.577 --> 38:52.039
Were you
or anyone in this house
approached by this woman?

38:52.248 --> 38:54.458
She worked for the
Center for Disease Control.

38:54.667 --> 38:55.710
She was murdered.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.088
No. I've never seen her.

39:00.798 --> 39:02.091
Don't lie to me, Patrice.

39:02.258 --> 39:03.551
I... Like I said, I don't...

39:03.759 --> 39:04.635
What the hell's
going on, girls?

39:04.844 --> 39:06.178
Do you know what time it is?

39:08.639 --> 39:09.682
Carey Gold?

39:12.435 --> 39:13.769
Patrice is your daughter?

39:14.603 --> 39:17.273
Everyone. Everyone.
Can I have your attention?

39:17.523 --> 39:18.941
Everyone, if I may?

39:19.191 --> 39:20.026
A toast!

39:21.110 --> 39:22.486
To Major Lillywhite.

39:22.695 --> 39:25.031
A good man, a good friend.

39:25.239 --> 39:26.115
Too pretty?

39:27.533 --> 39:28.617
Too human?

39:28.993 --> 39:29.910
Too tan?

39:31.120 --> 39:32.580
Alas, yes.

39:32.788 --> 39:34.415
But I say,
let us not judge a man

39:34.582 --> 39:35.750
by the color of his skin,

39:35.958 --> 39:37.710
but by the content
of his character.

39:38.669 --> 39:39.587
To Major!

39:41.130 --> 39:42.965
Hey, hey, there's
a beverage here.

39:43.174 --> 39:45.343
All right.
I'll miss you guys, too.

39:48.763 --> 39:49.847
I mean it.

39:50.097 --> 39:51.057
I'm gonna miss you guys.

39:51.265 --> 39:52.433
Back at you, man.

39:53.059 --> 39:54.560
Listen, can we talk?

39:55.019 --> 39:55.770
Yeah.

40:00.691 --> 40:01.400
What's up?

40:01.609 --> 40:03.194
I hate to pull you
out of there.

40:03.444 --> 40:04.236
It's Liv.

40:04.945 --> 40:08.032
She was supposed to be here
a couple hours ago,
now I can't get a hold of her.

40:08.657 --> 40:10.659
Like, is this a thing
she does or...

40:10.910 --> 40:13.204
No. Sometimes she gets
caught up in her work.

40:13.454 --> 40:14.789
I'm sure something
just came up.

40:17.917 --> 40:19.502
Brace yourself. You ready?

40:20.544 --> 40:22.296
- Ready for what?
- Go get her, White Fang.

40:24.215 --> 40:25.383
Oh, my.

40:25.549 --> 40:27.218
You had a dog in there?

40:27.468 --> 40:29.553
Yeah, poor guy.

40:29.762 --> 40:31.180
He's getting tired
of hotel life.

40:32.098 --> 40:33.849
I'll finally get him to
my new place tomorrow.

40:34.475 --> 40:35.684
He's gonna like having a yard.

40:38.312 --> 40:39.522
I got a couple of brain tubes

40:39.730 --> 40:41.107
in my mini-fridge
if you're hungry.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.566
Or we can order room service.

40:43.651 --> 40:45.069
I should get going.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.196
It's probably getting late.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.702
You know, I have to,
uh, confess something to you.

40:56.205 --> 40:57.081
Yeah?

40:59.083 --> 41:02.002
I've been thinking
about you since we met
at the Baracus fundraiser.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.466
Sure I can't talk you
into staying?

41:07.675 --> 41:08.592
Perhaps joining me
in the shower?

41:13.139 --> 41:13.889
Hey.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.683
You know that guy?

41:16.725 --> 41:17.435
What guy?

41:17.601 --> 41:20.479
Guy in the dark coat
just wandered in here,
started drinking our beer.

41:21.522 --> 41:22.648
Never seen him before.

41:23.858 --> 41:27.153
Probably some wino,
got a whiff of alcohol,
sensed an opportunity.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.029
Hey, buddy.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.533
Yo, dude, look, it's...

41:33.784 --> 41:35.327
Zombies are abominations.

41:36.912 --> 41:39.540
That's what we are.
Abominations!

41:40.791 --> 41:41.417
No.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.753
I told Liv
I didn't want her out there
putting herself in...
