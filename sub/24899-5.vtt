[Pike Senior sighs]
I wanted to protect  you.

37:53.845 --> 37:55.445
No, you didn'’t.

37:55.485 --> 37:59.165
Everything I'’ve done
is to protect  you!

37:59.205 --> 38:02.205
Yes, I knew Sharp
back in the '’80s.

38:02.245 --> 38:04.365
Yes, he'’s always been bad news.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.285
I wanted you off the case...

38:09.885 --> 38:11.645
..because nothing good
has ever come

38:11.685 --> 38:13.765
from our attempts
to put him behind bars.

38:13.805 --> 38:16.085
So why didn'’t you just tell us
that you knew him, Dad?

38:16.125 --> 38:17.885
Why didn'’t you tell us
he was an ex-cop?

38:17.925 --> 38:19.445
That was 30 years ago.

38:20.685 --> 38:22.165
I told you we came across him,

38:22.205 --> 38:24.845
that he'’s slipped the net
a number of times.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.965
And how did he manage that, Dad?

38:27.005 --> 38:28.645
Huh?

38:28.685 --> 38:31.605
You and Sharp
was in something together.

38:31.645 --> 38:33.725
Now he'’s dead...
and I wanna know why.

38:33.765 --> 38:36.765
I have no idea why he'’s dead

38:36.805 --> 38:38.365
and I have no idea
who killed him.

38:38.405 --> 38:41.405
He was a bent cop
and you protected him!

38:41.445 --> 38:43.445
Look, for once,
just tell the truth!

38:43.485 --> 38:46.005
For once in your life,
just tell the fucking truth!

38:46.045 --> 38:48.085
- Careful, boy!
- What were you and Sharp doing?

38:48.125 --> 38:49.445
You'’re on thin ice!

38:55.365 --> 38:59.325
Son, there...there are things
I-I want to tell you.

38:59.365 --> 39:01.765
But you want things
to be simple -

39:01.805 --> 39:03.845
good, bad, black, white.

39:03.885 --> 39:06.125
- But this is complicated.
- Oh, Dad, whatever.

39:06.165 --> 39:07.925
- Junior.
- Get off me!

39:10.005 --> 39:12.965
All I'’ve ever wanted
was the best for  you.

39:14.565 --> 39:16.965
You made me move jobs
to get me out of the way...

39:19.045 --> 39:21.485
..to protect yourself,
your image...

39:22.245 --> 39:23.725
..your legacy.

39:23.765 --> 39:25.445
It'’s always been about you,
Dad -

39:25.485 --> 39:28.085
some wannabe middle-class
white-man'’s puppet

39:28.125 --> 39:30.045
with a fucking club tie...

39:31.445 --> 39:33.365
..and a secret handshake.

39:34.285 --> 39:35.525
Fuck me.

39:35.565 --> 39:37.485
I can'’t believe...

39:39.565 --> 39:42.645
Why should I ever
look up to you?

39:42.685 --> 39:45.405
All I'’ve ever wanted to do
was make you proud.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.605
More fool me.

39:51.685 --> 39:53.405
Do you know what?

39:53.445 --> 39:56.125
I know who you are.

39:56.165 --> 39:58.085
And I'’m gonna find out
what you did.

39:59.365 --> 40:01.285
Then I'’m coming for you.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.605
[Door slams]

40:31.325 --> 40:33.045
We need to talk.

40:41.965 --> 40:43.285
[Car engine starts]

40:57.805 --> 41:00.605
- [Ringing tone]
- Come on, Bish.

41:00.645 --> 41:03.125
- The number you are calling... - For God'’s sake.

41:04.085 --> 41:06.005
[Phone buzzes]

41:08.285 --> 41:09.965
Yo, what'’s happening, Pike?

41:10.005 --> 41:12.445
Yo, Munroe.
Oi, hand Bish your phone.

41:12.485 --> 41:14.005
I need to talk to him,
real quick.

41:14.045 --> 41:16.045
Er...he'’s not at his desk, bruv.

41:16.085 --> 41:19.085
Well, find him, Munroe!
It'’s important, man! Come on!

41:21.285 --> 41:22.765
[Mutters] Come on. Come on.

41:28.485 --> 41:31.245
It'’s Pike.
He needs to speak to you.

41:31.285 --> 41:32.805
Only if he'’s sorry.

41:35.205 --> 41:37.565
He says: only if you'’re sorry.

41:37.605 --> 41:39.485
Just put him on the phone now,
please!

41:39.525 --> 41:41.045
Mate.

41:41.085 --> 41:44.125
Nah, man, I need to know
that he'’s sorry.

41:44.165 --> 41:46.445
All right. All right, look.
I'’m sorry, yeah?

41:46.485 --> 41:47.925
MUNROE:  He says he'’s sorry.

41:49.365 --> 41:51.285
- He said that?
- Yeah.

41:52.805 --> 41:54.885
Yo, man. I need to hear it
with my own ears.

41:54.925 --> 41:56.685
Bish, I showed my dad
the photos.

41:56.725 --> 41:58.485
He looked scared, man.

41:58.525 --> 42:02.245
He was on his phone. He'’s acting
funny. I'’m tailing him now.

42:02.285 --> 42:04.685
Looks like he'’s involved
in some serious shit.

42:04.725 --> 42:07.165
Get mobile and come
and meet me, yeah?

42:07.205 --> 42:10.405
Get Kamali to track Pike'’s
co-ordinates and meet us there.

42:10.445 --> 42:13.165
KAMALI:  I traced Pike'’s phone
to Elizabeth Trading Estate,

42:13.205 --> 42:14.765
Juno Way, SE14.

42:15.925 --> 42:17.805
PIKE: Yo, Bish, are you mobile?

42:17.845 --> 42:19.885
It looks like
we'’re about to turn off.

42:19.925 --> 42:23.565
Two minutes, man, two minutes.

42:23.605 --> 42:26.445
This don'’t look good, man.
What the fuck'’s he doing?

42:47.245 --> 42:49.685
He'’s stopped. Looks like
he'’s waiting for someone.

42:49.725 --> 42:51.565
BISHOP: I'’m nearly there, man.
30 seconds!

42:56.365 --> 42:58.845
[Motorcycle approaching
at speed]

43:04.805 --> 43:06.125
Shit.

43:09.165 --> 43:10.365
No!

43:10.405 --> 43:11.405
Oh, fuck!

43:14.165 --> 43:18.445
Officer down! Elizabeth Trading
Estate, Juno way, SE14!

43:19.525 --> 43:20.765
Dad, no!

43:20.805 --> 43:22.245
Bishop in pursuit of shooter.

43:24.085 --> 43:25.325
Fuck!

43:27.205 --> 43:28.405
[Tyres screech]

43:30.085 --> 43:32.285
PIKE:  Get a fucking ambulance
here now!

43:32.325 --> 43:34.245
[Tyres screech]

43:38.005 --> 43:39.925
Armed Police. Get off the bike!

43:43.645 --> 43:45.565
Get off the bike!

43:46.885 --> 43:49.405
[Motorcycle engine revs]

[Engine revs]

44:09.885 --> 44:11.485
[Grunting]

44:24.485 --> 44:25.885
In another life...

44:27.165 --> 44:30.285
..we three could be...partners.

44:30.325 --> 44:32.485
BISHOP: He said it himself.
He'’s a hired gun.

44:32.525 --> 44:35.005
That'’s a job, it's not a reason.

44:35.045 --> 44:36.525
What do you want me
to do with this?

44:36.565 --> 44:38.885
- The right thing.
- You do know what that means?

44:38.925 --> 44:40.445
It'’s me.

44:40.485 --> 44:44.005
I'’ve found something out, it
stinks, it'’s not right or fair.

44:44.045 --> 44:45.765
That'’s Arjana.
What'’s she doing there?
