I've talked to lots
of principals

08:09.576 --> 08:11.229
about much worse things.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.014
- Like what?
- In high school,

08:13.057 --> 08:14.798
I had an affair
with the principal's wife.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.191
Worked out fine.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.323
We boxed
in front of the high school.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.977
Now was this fight
in black and white?

08:20.021 --> 08:21.588
And was Charlie Chaplin there?

08:21.631 --> 08:24.199
<i>[upbeat funky music]</i>

08:24.242 --> 08:27.463
- We're live in three, two...
- Welcome back.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.727
Are you ready to get your kids
off screens and outside?

08:30.771 --> 08:32.599
[together]
Yeah!

08:32.642 --> 08:35.078
Hey, I gotta warn you.
Just because your kids,

08:35.123 --> 08:36.428
it doesn't mean
I'm not coming for you.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.126
Yeah, he couldn't care less
who he hurts.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.083
Right, Kenan?

08:40.128 --> 08:41.563
What I think she means is,

08:41.607 --> 08:43.304
I'm a three-legged
race champion.

08:43.347 --> 08:45.307
- And a two-legged jerk.
- Easy.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.744
Now, we'd love to introduce you
to Couch Roy--

08:47.788 --> 08:50.486
Wagner here to tell us about
the Fulton County school's

08:50.530 --> 08:52.096
new youth initiative,

08:52.140 --> 08:54.577
Screens Off, Play On.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.231
Well, I'm super pumped
to be here

08:56.274 --> 08:58.538
and show you a few games
we're gonna be playing.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.017
- Yeah!
- Well, we're super pumped

09:00.061 --> 09:01.323
to have you.
- We are.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.020
All right.
Who's ready to do this?

09:03.064 --> 09:04.848
[together] Yeah!
- Let's get it started.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.589
- All right!
- Go!

09:06.633 --> 09:07.982
Okay, Kenan,
just come straight.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.331
Listen to my voice.

09:09.374 --> 09:10.332
I'm trying.
I'm trying.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.464
Walk forward to me, Kenan.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.554
Just, okay, now in just, like,
a straight line.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.381
Hey, hey.
Get away from me.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.340
That's just a stanchion.
Come this way.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.037
- Okay.
- Let's go left. Left!

09:20.081 --> 09:21.169
My left or your left?

09:21.212 --> 09:22.518
It's always about you.
Your left.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.519
Right, right, right,
right, right.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.564
I'm winning,
I'm win--Oh.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.218
Oh, come on.
[cheering]

09:28.089 --> 09:31.527
Ready, set, and toss.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.311
- Good toss.
- Everybody take a step back.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.357
And toss.
- Nice and easy now.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.837
Oh.
Gee, I'm sorry.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.360
- Damn it.
- You are out.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.014
I can't believe you.

09:40.057 --> 09:43.408
Ow. It's all right.

09:43.452 --> 09:46.063
I missed breakfast anyway.

09:46.107 --> 09:49.676
- Ready, set, go.
- Right, left, right.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.199
Okay, this is a first.
Okay, here we go.

09:51.242 --> 09:54.202
Wait, Kenan.
Left, right--ah!

09:54.245 --> 09:55.682
- Get up.
- Just stay down.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.727
You stay down.
This is your fault.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.555
Stop it.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.122
Just follow the directions that
we clearly decided on together.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.558
What directions?

10:02.602 --> 10:05.909
Well, we may have gotten
schooled by a bunch of kids,

10:05.953 --> 10:07.389
but at least we inspired

10:07.432 --> 10:09.217
everybody to turn
their screens off

10:09.260 --> 10:10.958
and play with their friends.
Right, y'all?

10:11.001 --> 10:12.960
[together] Yeah!

10:13.003 --> 10:15.702
Okay, don't get too excited.
You're just his show friends.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.921
All right.
Well, Phil, take it away.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.183
Say bye, everybody.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.881
[together] Bye.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.578
And we're out.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.797
Yeah, I think
that went pretty good.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.799
[bleep] you, Kenan.

10:25.842 --> 10:29.716
And luck you too--as well.
You have much luck.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.935
When y'all go home later, tell
your families she said "luck."

10:36.244 --> 10:38.681
Man.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.465
Hey, Kenan, so--oh,

10:40.509 --> 10:41.684
your dressing room stinks
more than that segment.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.077
Oh, hilarious.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.601
Maybe next time don't tether me
and Tami together

10:45.645 --> 10:47.690
and have us crawl
through a dog park.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.387
I came out
with two bruised elbows

10:49.431 --> 10:51.041
and a tracksuit full of dookie.

10:51.085 --> 10:53.000
Okay, what is going on
with you and Tami?

10:53.043 --> 10:54.566
Is this still about
her birthday toast?

10:54.610 --> 10:56.046
No.
She's all bent out of shape,

10:56.090 --> 10:57.700
'cause she thought
we were friends.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.615
And it's your fault,
because you hired her

10:59.659 --> 11:00.964
and forced us to work together.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.487
What?
Kenan, don't tell me

11:02.531 --> 11:04.664
that you're still hung up
on that after all these years.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.100
Why wouldn't I be?

11:06.143 --> 11:08.102
It was my show,
and then you brought her in

11:08.145 --> 11:10.974
for no reason.
- No reason?

11:11.018 --> 11:12.628
Do you not remember
what the show was like

11:12.672 --> 11:15.979
before Tami?
- Yeah, it was great.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.373
Common marker.
And now it's time for a segment

11:18.416 --> 11:20.157
called "Kenan on Kenan"

11:20.201 --> 11:22.943
where I interview
a very special guest, me.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.119
We're so happy
to have you here, Kenan.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.208
Yo, I'm humbled
to be here, Kenan.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.427
And we are so humbled
to have you here.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.952
So what are your thoughts
on the Middle East?

11:31.995 --> 11:34.171
I don't know, dawg.
It's, like, far as hell.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.608
Hmm. Hmm.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.307
Take 17.
This one, semi-clean.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.265
But the toilet paper,
rough as hell.

11:41.309 --> 11:44.355
So I'm sorry. I'm gonna have
to rank the public restroom

11:44.399 --> 11:47.924
on the corner of Auburn
and Peach Street as a no-go.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.361
I took my toast
out of the toaster

11:50.405 --> 11:52.450
and I just started crying.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.104
I have chills.

11:54.148 --> 11:57.107
Do y'all see Luther Vandross
on this toast?

11:58.500 --> 12:01.982
Okay. Hmm.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.287
I don't remember
it being that terrible.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.333
Oh, I do.
You were too close to it.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.683
And you had a bit
of an ego back then.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.076
I don't know about that.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.774
Uh, Kenan,
you interviewed yourself

12:11.818 --> 12:13.428
and demanded you both be paid.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.995
Man, how did the network
not cancel us?

12:15.038 --> 12:16.387
Oh,
they never saw these tapes.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.128
Yeah, I told them
they burned up in a fire.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.478
- Yep.
- Then I revamped the show

12:20.522 --> 12:22.306
and hired Tami.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.919
She was so excited to be able
to work with you back then.

12:25.962 --> 12:29.009
But you just had this wall up.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.794
Hmm, yeah,
I guess I never let it down.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.713
Thank you.
I owe somebody an apology.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.237
Oh, while you're making
new friends,

12:40.281 --> 12:43.023
why don't you give
old Brucie a shot?

12:43.066 --> 12:44.981
Pew-pew,
pew-pew-pew-pew.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.417
Hey, come on, man.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.115
That's why people don't
invite you to the cookout.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.725
This editing bay
is making people weird.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.249
[blows]

12:52.293 --> 12:56.079
The school enjoyed Birdie's
TikTok video about Mr. Jones.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.690
It's been sent
to him 150 times.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.432
I found him crying
in the toilet.

13:01.476 --> 13:04.000
- Hilarious.
- It's also a direct violation

13:04.044 --> 13:05.785
of our social media policy
here.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.831
Yeah, but you know, kids.
Am I right?

13:08.875 --> 13:10.702
They got all kind
of crazy ideas.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.008
They do.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.923
But I think Birdie
got this idea from you.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.012
You a damn liar.
Nobody gets an idea from me.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.580
<i>"Attention all students.</i> <i>
This is Mr. Jones,</i>

13:18.623 --> 13:21.539
<i>emperor of the parking lot."</i>

13:21.583 --> 13:24.542
That man is
a two-time teacher of the year

13:24.586 --> 13:28.024
and won three consecutive
Steve Harvey Hoodie Awards.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.331
You show him some respect.

13:30.374 --> 13:33.813
- You was recording me?
- Sorry. It was funny.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.249
- It was funny.
- Was it?

13:35.292 --> 13:36.859
'Cause it also carries
a penalty

13:36.903 --> 13:38.730
of a two-day
in-school suspension.

13:38.774 --> 13:42.038
- Suspension?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.866
Can't we work this out?
I mean,

13:43.910 --> 13:47.827
maybe over
a couple of margaritas?

13:48.784 --> 13:51.918
I'm a recovering alcoholic
and an active lesbian.

13:53.789 --> 13:57.053
- Huh.
- I got this.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.533
First of all,
congratulations.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.231
Listen, I have very deep
connections with a little show

14:01.275 --> 14:02.754
called "Wake Up with Kenan."

14:02.798 --> 14:05.061
How long would the suspension
be if I hooked you up

14:05.105 --> 14:09.022
with maybe a backstage tour?
Meet and greet?

14:09.065 --> 14:10.719
- Five days.
- What? Five?

14:10.762 --> 14:11.807
- That's right.
- That's more.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.243
- Mm-hmm.
- That's stupid.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.941
Can we go back to that
original plan of two days?

14:14.984 --> 14:16.072
- Good choice.
- Boom.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.204
- Good job.
- Got her.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.554
[groans]

14:19.597 --> 14:21.295
[doorbell rings]

14:21.338 --> 14:22.818
[clears throat]

14:24.211 --> 14:27.779
Hey, I just wanted to come by
and say, "I'm sorry."

14:27.823 --> 14:30.391
Okay.
Oh, great.

14:30.434 --> 14:34.003
Well, I wanted--splendid.
You enjoy that bubbly.

14:34.047 --> 14:37.485
I guess I'll just shove
my apologies up my bottom.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.533
[sighs heavily]

14:42.577 --> 14:44.753
Kenan.
Hey, buddy.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.450
Hey, David.
Man, I'm sorry.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.496
I just came by to talk to Tami,
but she--

14:48.539 --> 14:51.673
Is angry with you.
You're in the doghouse.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.457
Glad it's not me again.
[chuckles]

14:53.501 --> 14:54.589
Come on in, man.

14:54.632 --> 14:55.851
- You sure?
- Yeah, come on.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.114
Okay.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.246
Sorry about the mess.

14:59.289 --> 15:00.812
I didn't know company
was coming.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.424
Oh, you're still here.
Was the door slam not clear?

15:03.467 --> 15:05.905
Oh, God.
Tinky, come on.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.820
He came all the way out here.
Just talk to him.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.692
Here.

15:10.735 --> 15:14.478
You sit.
Have some champagne.

15:14.522 --> 15:15.697
Well, thank you.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.220
To be clear,
he calls you "Tinky"?

15:17.264 --> 15:18.569
Yeah, it's short
for Tinkerbell.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.789
I stole him
from a trash bag named Wendy.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.138
Tinky, stop it.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.662
That's my mom.
Love you.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.320
[clears throat]

15:32.757 --> 15:36.936
So look, Tami,
I'm really sorry.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.372
About everything.

15:38.415 --> 15:41.070
I realized I've been feeling
a way towards you

15:41.114 --> 15:42.506
for, like,
the last nine years because--

15:42.550 --> 15:44.987
I'm sorry.
Nine years?

15:45.031 --> 15:48.556
Yeah, but it wasn't anything
personal towards you, exactly.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.819
I mean, you've been great.
Always have been.

15:50.862 --> 15:54.344
I guess I just never let myself
get too close to you

15:54.388 --> 15:56.216
because of how
we were put together.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.870
But I realize now that
I'm the one that missed out,

15:58.914 --> 16:01.830
so I'm sorry.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.266
Tinky,

16:03.310 --> 16:04.398
Bridger says he doesn't need
to take a bath today.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.791
He doesn't get to decide.
He's five.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.445
Remember, you're the dad,
David.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.404
Ten-four, my love.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.234
My little Birdie
was the exact same way.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.844
She used to hate
to take a bath.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.585
We would throw her in the pool
with a Tide pod.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.456
- [laughs]
- Is that bad?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.676
Uh, I just bribe mine
with popsicles.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.330
Tinky's gotta do
what a Tinky's gotta do.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.506
Am I right?
- Yeah, sure does.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.943
This helps.
- Cheers to that.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.296
Oh, those playbills are cool.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.645
What? Oh.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.083
Is that one signed
by the wickedly talented,

16:37.126 --> 16:39.128
one and only Adele Dazeem?

16:39.172 --> 16:40.521

Um, yeah.
I'm kind of a Broadway nut.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.613
I used to spend summers
with my aunt in New York, so...

16:46.875 --> 16:49.051
I'm a touring
show guy myself.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.357
When "Little Shop"
came through Atlanta,

16:50.400 --> 16:51.749
that really made me
want to perform.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.012
- No way.
- Yeah.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.579
That and the money.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.146

from "Little Shop."

16:57.190 --> 16:58.713

16:58.756 --> 17:00.280
That would be a Little Shop

17:00.323 --> 17:03.065
You see what I--put
a little theater in the humor.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.415
Oh, my gosh. You would be
so great in that show.

17:05.459 --> 17:06.808
- You think?
- I do.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.896
Like as the plant or?

17:08.940 --> 17:10.986
No, I think
you could play Seymour.

Birdie and take her phone.

First they love you,
then they hate you.

And then they need something,
and it starts all over again.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.563

They hate you.

a little Kenan right now.
