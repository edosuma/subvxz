WEBVTT

00:00.929 --> 00:03.042
Previously on Royal Pains...

00:03.042 --> 00:05.243
Chief investigator of
the clinical trial agreed

00:05.311 --> 00:06.477
I would be able to travel...

00:06.545 --> 00:08.313
If there is continuity of care.

00:08.380 --> 00:09.781
Aha.

00:09.849 --> 00:11.049
Our marriage has been on hold

00:11.116 --> 00:13.051
since that crazy night it first began.

00:13.118 --> 00:14.953
We'll take the time we
need to work through this.

00:15.020 --> 00:17.121
And then we need to focus on us...

00:17.189 --> 00:18.122
We need to go to marriage counseling.

00:18.190 --> 00:20.024
On our honeymoon.

00:20.092 --> 00:21.459
Marriage counseling.

00:21.527 --> 00:23.728
You'll be on bed rest... No going to work,

00:23.796 --> 00:25.864
no going anywhere that's
farther than the fridge.

00:25.931 --> 00:27.232
You'll need help.

00:27.299 --> 00:29.634
- Are you two...?
- No, we're just friends,

00:29.702 --> 00:31.703
and I'll be taking care of her.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.806
Jeremiah, what if you
could return to Hankmed

00:34.874 --> 00:36.541
and not work with me at all.

00:36.609 --> 00:38.409
How would that be possible?

00:38.477 --> 00:40.645
You would be in charge.

00:40.713 --> 00:43.181
Just out of curiosity,
does your offer still stand?

00:43.249 --> 00:44.749
I would need a full commitment.

00:44.817 --> 00:46.751
How long till we leave?

00:46.819 --> 00:48.887
How fast can you pack?

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.586 --> 01:05.689
Young man, where is Divya?

01:05.756 --> 01:07.190
Uh, which one is she, the Indian one?

01:07.258 --> 01:09.826
I have another one of these in an hour.

01:09.894 --> 01:12.162
You double-booked puja ceremonies?

01:12.229 --> 01:14.230
Pujas don't pay as much as weddings.

01:14.298 --> 01:16.232
I have to overcommit to cover my nuts.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.169
I think it's "nut."

01:19.236 --> 01:22.172
I'll track her down for you.

01:33.417 --> 01:35.018
Inappropriate for this setting?

01:37.655 --> 01:39.322
Mmm.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.524
- Highly inappropriate.
- Oh.

01:41.592 --> 01:44.461
But I hear there's a dozen
empty bedrooms upstairs.

01:44.528 --> 01:47.630
- Oh, really?
- Quiet, private.

01:47.698 --> 01:52.302
In fact, some of them probably
haven't seen action in years.

01:52.370 --> 01:54.971
Well, I feel really bad
for those rooms, uh...

01:55.039 --> 01:56.373
More so for myself, actually,

01:56.440 --> 01:57.974
'cause I need to find Divya right now.

01:58.042 --> 02:01.059
I'll assume that's an unrelated matter.

02:01.059 --> 02:02.263
Highly unrelated.

02:02.353 --> 02:05.124
- Have you seen her?
- No.

02:05.324 --> 02:07.317
No, good call. Where is he at?

02:07.385 --> 02:09.987
Ah.

02:10.054 --> 02:13.190
So when was the last time
Divya spoke to the father?

02:13.258 --> 02:16.426
Oh, I-I'm not sure.
We're just good friends...

02:16.494 --> 02:18.228
And roommates and, uh...

02:18.296 --> 02:20.497
But I don't know all
the details of her life.

02:20.565 --> 02:21.598
Do you know where Divya is?

02:21.666 --> 02:24.434
Oh, yes, I do. Here, follow me.

02:24.502 --> 02:28.038
Sashi, your blouse is blue,
just like that sky up there.

02:33.211 --> 02:35.178
- Hey, you two.
- Hey.

02:35.246 --> 02:36.847
What are you doing way over here?

02:36.915 --> 02:39.850
I'm hiding from the army
of random Hampton notables

02:39.918 --> 02:41.418
my father has invited.

02:41.486 --> 02:45.022
Who has ever heard of hiring a
P.R. firm for a puja ceremony?

02:45.089 --> 02:47.090
Who ever heard of a puja ceremony?

02:47.158 --> 02:49.226
Your dad is so excited to be a grandpa.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.429
He's excited to be the center
of attention for a change.

02:52.497 --> 02:55.499
Hmm, well, you, Divya, need to
keep up with today's schedule.

02:55.567 --> 02:56.667
It's time to start already?

02:56.734 --> 02:58.468
Yeah, your pundit has summoned you.

02:58.536 --> 03:00.304
All we're missing now is Hank.

03:00.371 --> 03:03.073
Evan, you know that Hank RSVP'd "maybe."

03:03.141 --> 03:05.709
When did "maybe" become the
new "no," guys? Come on.

03:05.777 --> 03:09.468
Well, Rafa declined the old-fashioned way.

03:09.536 --> 03:10.903
He just said, "decline."

03:10.971 --> 03:11.971
- Oh.
- Did he give a reason?

03:12.039 --> 03:13.673
Uh, his latest stalker.

03:13.740 --> 03:15.274
The police are after her,

03:15.342 --> 03:18.044
and he didn't want to attract
any craziness to the puja.

03:18.111 --> 03:19.679
Mm-hmm. All right, giddy up.

03:19.746 --> 03:23.416
Hey, babe, listen, um, I know you miss Hank,

03:23.483 --> 03:25.951
But do you think
you might be projecting?

03:26.019 --> 03:27.687
What do you mean?

03:27.754 --> 03:30.556
I just don't want to see you
get hurt, like last time.

03:32.526 --> 03:34.260
Hey guys, we don't need to find a new doctor

03:34.327 --> 03:35.995
for the summer, okay? Hank will be back.

03:36.063 --> 03:37.430
Evan, you're being unrealistic.

03:37.497 --> 03:39.832
Boris' clinical trial won't
even end until August.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.702
Why don't I pull some resumes, just in case?

03:42.769 --> 03:44.637
That sounds like a fair compromise.

03:44.705 --> 03:46.505
- Agreed.
- I'm really proud

03:46.573 --> 03:48.107
of the way you just stepped
outside of yourself.

03:48.175 --> 03:52.011
Okay, so, Jeremiah, that covers personnel.

03:52.079 --> 03:53.546
Good. What's next?

03:53.613 --> 03:55.581
Next, you guys discuss
outstanding follow-ups

03:55.649 --> 03:57.483
while I continue making headbands

03:57.551 --> 03:59.385
- for the Valentine's Day party.
- You know what?

03:59.453 --> 04:01.721
- I will help you.
- Oh, good.

04:01.788 --> 04:03.656
How... oh, my goodness.
How am I gonna help you?

04:03.724 --> 04:07.560
Um, what do you think of this one?

04:08.895 --> 04:10.463
You're like a headband savant.

04:10.530 --> 04:12.231
We got another call from Mrs. Abovsky.

04:12.299 --> 04:14.533
Her abdominal discomfort hasn't abated.

04:14.601 --> 04:16.802
Let's move her up in the schedule.

04:16.870 --> 04:18.971
She's complaining of nausea,
cramps, sharp pains...

04:21.173 --> 04:22.842
- We're acting out symptoms now?
- No.

04:22.909 --> 04:25.878
No, I'm... I'm having a contraction.

04:25.946 --> 04:28.814
- Oh my God.
- Oh! Ho ho.

04:28.882 --> 04:30.950
Oh. Oh.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.623
And now the father of the mother

04:37.691 --> 04:42.181
will address all those congregated here.

04:53.627 --> 04:57.163
Rubina and I have the distinct
honor of informing you

04:57.231 --> 05:00.032
that Divya's daughter has been named Sashi

05:00.100 --> 05:03.736
after her grandmother, my beloved mother.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.805
It has taken 30 years,

05:05.873 --> 05:09.141
but Divya has finally embraced her heritage.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.944
Divya beti, I'm so proud of you,

05:12.012 --> 05:14.614
as are all of us here.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.827
Hello?

05:31.798 --> 05:33.966
Hello?

05:36.036 --> 05:39.205
Anyone home?

05:42.743 --> 05:45.511
You embraced your heritage?

05:45.579 --> 05:47.981
Well, I realized the importance of

05:48.049 --> 05:50.417
having a legacy to pass down to my child

05:50.485 --> 05:51.985
like that bottle of gripe water.

05:52.053 --> 05:54.388
Exactly, though medically speaking,

05:54.455 --> 05:56.123
I would never use that stuff on my baby.

05:56.191 --> 05:58.959
My mother used it to soothe
my stomach when I was little,

05:59.027 --> 06:03.130
so I carry it around everywhere
as a token of family tradition.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.702
- You forgot the gripe water.
- Yes.

06:10.205 --> 06:11.471
Oh, it's your phone again.

06:15.410 --> 06:17.177
Is everything okay?

06:17.245 --> 06:20.180
No. Rafa says that his stalker
may be in the Hamptons.

06:20.248 --> 06:22.216
He wants me to alert Shadow Pond security.

06:22.283 --> 06:25.185
I'll alert security and
then fetch the gripe water.

06:25.253 --> 06:28.455
Thank you, Jeremiah.

06:47.742 --> 06:49.393
Hello.

06:50.665 --> 06:51.516
Hi.

06:51.973 --> 06:54.050
Should I just leave my present here?

06:54.050 --> 06:56.931
Oh, yes. Divya's looking forward
to opening them after the party.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.812
I had no idea that Divya
had such a nice place.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.415
Oh, no... this is the Lawson residence.

07:03.482 --> 07:05.150
Divya's just throwing the party here.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.986
Oh, so the party's still going on?

07:08.054 --> 07:10.188
Technically, it hasn't started yet.

07:10.256 --> 07:12.957
They're doing the ceremony now.

07:13.025 --> 07:14.392
I'm Jeremiah.

07:14.460 --> 07:15.860
I'm Emma.

07:15.928 --> 07:19.164
- Oh.
- I'm a friend of Divya's.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.666
Oh. Well, I'm just grabbing
something for the baby,

07:21.734 --> 07:24.703
- then I can show you to her.
- Great.

07:26.706 --> 07:30.475
Wow. That is the biggest
house I have ever seen.

07:30.543 --> 07:32.343
At 109,000 square feet,

07:32.411 --> 07:34.479
it's the biggest house
most people have ever seen.

07:38.651 --> 07:40.752
Uh, well, I have to get this to Divya.

07:40.820 --> 07:44.022
I'll see you inside.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.889
I am sure it was just an RSVP mix-up.

08:17.957 --> 08:20.258
I'm sorry. I don't even see
you on the invitee list.

08:20.326 --> 08:21.593
Hi, Liz.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.695
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:23.763 --> 08:25.563
I don't believe that we've met. I'm Divya.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.565
Oh, hi. I'm Emma.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.434
Hi, Emma.

08:29.502 --> 08:30.869
And you are?

08:30.936 --> 08:33.638
- I'm a friend of Jeremiah's.
- Really?

08:35.140 --> 08:38.208
A friend of Jeremiah's?

08:38.277 --> 08:41.946
Yeah, um, a family friend.

08:42.014 --> 08:44.082
Oh.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.651
I'll escort her in, guys. Thank you.

08:50.222 --> 08:52.157
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:52.224 --> 08:55.360
Oh, uh, there's Jeremiah.
I should go say hello to him.

08:55.427 --> 08:57.195
Okay.

08:57.263 --> 08:59.531
How nice that he invited someone.

08:59.598 --> 09:01.266
Yeah.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.967
I hope you enjoy the party.

09:03.035 --> 09:05.970
- Yeah, I definitely will.
- Hmm.

09:17.049 --> 09:21.486
- Welcome home.
- Likewise, Hank.

09:21.554 --> 09:25.623
I hope you enjoy your stay...
all 24 hours of it.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.993
Watch your step, Boris.

09:29.061 --> 09:31.663
I'm more concerned with
other people watching it.

09:31.730 --> 09:35.266
Remember, Hank, we must preserve
appearances at all costs.

09:45.220 --> 09:49.586

09:50.807 --> 09:53.009
I can't believe how big Sashi's gotten.

09:53.076 --> 09:55.745
You blink at her age, you miss a lot.

09:55.812 --> 09:59.115
Thank you for stopping
through on your way to...

09:59.182 --> 10:01.017
- Oh.
- Wherever you and Boris

10:01.084 --> 10:02.919
- are headed to next.
- Uh, to be honest,

10:02.986 --> 10:05.154
I've kind of lost track
of our itinerary myself.

10:05.222 --> 10:08.257
I saw him limping earlier. Is he okay?

10:08.325 --> 10:09.725
Yeah, I saw that too. Has his...

10:09.793 --> 10:11.794
Has his family disease
finally kicked in or...?

10:11.862 --> 10:13.663
No, no, no, no. Nothing has kicked in.

10:13.730 --> 10:15.131
It's totally unrelated to his disease.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.832
- Oh.
- Uh, we were cliff diving in the Caymans,

10:16.900 --> 10:18.701
and he fractured his tibia.

10:18.769 --> 10:20.069
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

10:20.137 --> 10:21.871
- Cliff diving?
- When is his cast coming off?

10:21.939 --> 10:23.506
Uh, actually, it should come off today.

10:23.573 --> 10:26.108
- Great.
- Yeah.

10:29.579 --> 10:33.049
Hey. See... I thought you were in labor.

10:33.116 --> 10:34.317
She's not in labor.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.751
We don't have to cancel our party,

10:35.819 --> 10:38.354
and you need to dip faster
to keep up with my stirring.

10:38.422 --> 10:39.655
Dr. Neil determined

10:39.723 --> 10:42.158
that the pain earlier was Braxton Hicks.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.060
That means a practice contraction.

10:44.127 --> 10:45.294
Oh, I totally knew that.

10:45.362 --> 10:46.996
Remember what you learned in therapy.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.297
Humility is a strength.

10:48.365 --> 10:50.132
I totally didn't know that.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.968
In fairness, I was humbling Evan

10:52.035 --> 10:53.703
long before his therapist was.

10:53.770 --> 10:55.571
So, if you're not giving birth today,

10:55.639 --> 10:57.206
shouldn't you be back in bed?

10:57.274 --> 10:59.342
That's the good news. I am off bed rest.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.711
Now? So close to the day?

11:01.778 --> 11:03.913
Well, the onset of labor is
measured by cervical change,

11:03.981 --> 11:05.247
and Divya's cervix is...

11:05.315 --> 11:07.116
Not something I'm interested
in, but thank you.

11:07.184 --> 11:08.818
Thanks, Jeremiah.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.387
- What?
- Ugh. Lance hurt his arm.

11:11.455 --> 11:13.289
- Who's Lance?
- He's the lead singer

11:13.357 --> 11:15.925
and guitar player for the
band we booked for tonight.

11:15.993 --> 11:18.394
Sounds like someone should check him out.

11:18.462 --> 11:20.396
- Can you?
- Um, I'm not sure

11:20.464 --> 11:22.798
I can squeeze in another patient.

11:22.866 --> 11:25.835
Divya, you're cleared to stand,
walk, and work, right?

11:25.902 --> 11:27.436
I am.

11:27.504 --> 11:29.105
You know, I'm actually not
sure that's such a good idea.

11:29.172 --> 11:30.606
He's all the way out in Montauk.

11:30.674 --> 11:32.408
I can probably shuffle something around.

11:32.476 --> 11:35.277
Guys, I got it. Really.

11:35.345 --> 11:38.147
- Divya, you're my hero.
- Mm.

11:38.215 --> 11:40.249
With Valentine's Day hanging in the balance,

11:40.317 --> 11:41.884
you are definitely the man for the job.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.386
Hey! You're home!

11:43.453 --> 11:45.955
Hey! You're not answering any of my texts!

11:46.023 --> 11:48.290
Oh, sorry. I was dipping
strawberries in chocolate.

11:48.358 --> 11:49.925
Hey, I checked with the hospital,

11:49.993 --> 11:51.761
but they didn't have you admitted yet.

11:51.828 --> 11:54.130
- You called Hank.
- Hey, Jeremiah.

11:54.197 --> 11:55.631
- It was Braxton Hicks.
- Ah.

11:55.699 --> 11:57.500
- But welcome home!
- Thank you.

11:58.735 --> 12:00.503
- Really, Evan?
- You said "contraction."

12:00.570 --> 12:01.937
How am I... I thought...

12:04.041 --> 12:05.941
The point is, I'm so happy to see you.

12:06.009 --> 12:07.209
You're here in the nick of time.

12:07.277 --> 12:09.211
Someone needs to save
Valentine's Day, Henry,

12:09.279 --> 12:11.013
and Divya's in no condition
to go driving around

12:11.081 --> 12:12.181
seeing patients, right?

12:12.249 --> 12:13.682
You are definitely the man for the job.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.751
We have a musician in
Montauk with an injured arm.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.186
Henry, he's desperate.

12:17.254 --> 12:20.890
Yeah, I'm happy to help.
Just let me grab a quick shower.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.292
You realize you still haven't
given me a "welcome home" hug.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.461
- Let's talk after that shower.
- Okay, will do.

12:25.529 --> 12:28.097
Good to see you guys.

12:29.399 --> 12:32.068
Old-school Hankmed back in action.

12:32.135 --> 12:34.970
You think giving Hank a
patient will keep him here?

12:35.038 --> 12:37.973
It's never just a patient with Hank.

12:47.751 --> 12:50.286
Wow. No, I... trust me,
I'd love to fly to L.A.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.887
And play the new forum with you,

12:51.955 --> 12:53.956
but I just don't think I'm ready for that.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.792
Sorry, Billy.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.428
Sorry, Dr. Lawson, to keep you waiting,

12:59.496 --> 13:01.530
especially since there's
probably not much you can do.

13:01.598 --> 13:03.466
It's "Hank," and let's have a look

13:03.533 --> 13:05.267
before you turn down
another trip to Hollywood.

13:05.335 --> 13:07.803
He's always trying to get
me to play on the road.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.772
I'm not nearly good enough for his shows,

13:09.840 --> 13:13.008
but, you know, it's never easy
saying no to the piano man.

13:13.076 --> 13:16.745
Wait a second. I'm sorry.
That Billy was... Billy?

13:16.813 --> 13:18.948
He saw me play at a bar over on 27.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.282
He must've taken pity on me,

13:20.350 --> 13:22.017
because he's been calling me ever since.

13:22.085 --> 13:23.786
Wow. That's very cool.

13:23.854 --> 13:26.188
- All right, let's take a look.
- All right.

13:26.256 --> 13:29.525
- Ooh. Okay. Does that hurt?
- Ah. Yeah.

13:29.593 --> 13:30.960
How did this happen?

13:31.027 --> 13:34.130
I got dizzy, I fell, and
hit my elbow on the table.

13:34.197 --> 13:36.465
- Okay, does any of this hurt?
- Mm-mm.

13:36.533 --> 13:39.802
- I did save kitty cat, though.
- Who?

13:39.870 --> 13:41.137
That's the name of my guitar.

13:41.204 --> 13:43.472
Jerry Garcia called his "tiger."

13:43.540 --> 13:45.074
- So I decided... yeah.
- So you call yours "kitty cat."

13:45.142 --> 13:47.910
Well, I'm, uh... I'm glad
she survived the fall.

13:47.978 --> 13:50.045
Not that she's much use
to a one-armed musician.

13:50.113 --> 13:52.948
Well, let's get you back up to two.

13:54.284 --> 13:57.887
This aspiration should resolve
the traumatic bursitis,

13:57.954 --> 14:00.089
and I think you'll be able to
play tonight without a problem.

14:00.157 --> 14:02.691
Can you hold that down for me?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.326
Thank you.

14:04.394 --> 14:07.997
Lance, have you had other dizzy spells?

14:08.064 --> 14:09.265
Nothing too unusual.

14:09.332 --> 14:12.001
Okay. Other injuries? Falls of any kind?

14:12.068 --> 14:14.036
Not unless you count when I was six

14:14.104 --> 14:16.338
and I fell off the jungle gym.

14:16.406 --> 14:18.307
That's probably when I
decided to be a musician,

14:18.375 --> 14:19.842
not an athlete.

14:19.910 --> 14:21.644
And that's probably not the
answer we're looking for,

14:21.711 --> 14:23.646
but I'd like to do a head C.T.,
just to be safe.

14:23.713 --> 14:25.681
- Why?
- I just want to make sure

14:25.749 --> 14:28.984
your dizziness isn't something more serious.

14:29.052 --> 14:30.653
Do we really need to go there, doc?

14:30.720 --> 14:32.288
It's not very far to go.

14:32.355 --> 14:34.290
We can do it tonight before the party,

14:34.357 --> 14:37.259
our own little warm-up set.

14:37.327 --> 14:38.994
How's that? Is that better?

14:39.062 --> 14:41.397
- Wow, yeah.
- Okay, good.

14:44.734 --> 14:47.036
- Hey. Appletini, please.
- Yes, sir.

14:47.103 --> 14:50.272
If anyone asks, though,
it's a Midori Mojito.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.174
Yeah.

14:54.344 --> 14:55.811
What?

14:55.879 --> 14:58.447
- I didn't say anything.
- Your judgment is deafening.

14:58.515 --> 15:00.049
Just say it. Just speak your mind.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.251
Okay.

15:02.319 --> 15:05.321
If you're gonna drink like
a woman, own it like a man.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.559
You must be really close with Divya.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.832
Um, I'm Emma.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.802
Evan R. Lawson. Hi.

15:19.869 --> 15:21.904
You live here, right?

15:21.972 --> 15:24.306
No. I used to.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.342
My wife and I just found our
own place a few weeks ago.

15:26.409 --> 15:28.477
Oh, right. Right.

15:28.545 --> 15:30.379
I guess you have to leave the nest sometime.

15:30.447 --> 15:32.615
- Uh-huh.
- Your dad must get

15:32.682 --> 15:35.317
really lonely living here all by himself.

15:35.385 --> 15:37.152
My dad? Wow. That's precious.

15:37.220 --> 15:39.588
My dad couldn't afford the cable bill here.

15:39.656 --> 15:41.657
No, a man named Boris lives here,

15:41.725 --> 15:43.592
and my brother and I rent the guesthouse.

15:43.660 --> 15:45.060
You know, it's a nice arrangement.

15:45.128 --> 15:47.162
Oh, speak of the devil.
My brother's right there.

15:47.230 --> 15:50.065
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

16:01.222 --> 16:02.414
Yeah, I just want to drop my stuff off

16:02.483 --> 16:03.393
and get back to the party

16:03.512 --> 16:05.074
in time for Divya's dad's speech.

16:05.167 --> 16:07.407
Wow. Love what you've done with the place.

16:07.912 --> 16:09.841
What the hell have you done with it?

16:10.571 --> 16:13.797
Well, uh, according to the
time-honored roommate code,

16:13.876 --> 16:15.374
if you leave without saying good-bye,

16:15.374 --> 16:17.807
you know, your roommate takes
possession of all furniture

16:17.907 --> 16:20.369
and electronics and any
hypothetical loose change

16:20.467 --> 16:22.030
that might be hiding
between the sofa cushions,

16:22.112 --> 16:25.821
- even if it's a lot.
- Evan, where is all our stuff?

16:26.757 --> 16:27.857
Paige and I needed furniture,

16:27.925 --> 16:29.426
and furniture's really expensive,

16:29.493 --> 16:32.696
and you were off living the
high life with Boris, so...

16:32.763 --> 16:34.397
Speaking of, how's he doing? Is he okay?

16:34.465 --> 16:37.867
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, he's, um...

16:37.935 --> 16:39.102
He's doing well.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.804
That's great. Is he...

16:40.871 --> 16:42.105
cured?

16:42.173 --> 16:44.841
Well,
the trial isn't about curing the disease.

16:44.909 --> 16:47.944
It's about delaying the onset of symptoms.

16:48.012 --> 16:50.513
So this weekend is just
another pit stop for you?

16:50.581 --> 16:53.049
- Mm-hmm.
- Like last time?

16:59.223 --> 17:01.358
Okay, Lance, you can sit up now.

17:01.425 --> 17:03.059
Yes.

17:03.127 --> 17:05.395
So I don't know if you
know how lucky you are

17:05.463 --> 17:07.297
uh, to have Hank taking
care of you personally,

17:07.365 --> 17:09.499
but he's usually off
jetsetting with other patients.

17:09.567 --> 17:11.300
- Oh.
- You can ask Hank

17:11.368 --> 17:13.703
about any medical problem, anything...

17:13.771 --> 17:16.306
Anything in the world, like,
anything in the universe.

17:16.374 --> 17:19.709
- He'll know how to fix it, like...
- Okay, Ev, thanks for the plug.

17:19.777 --> 17:22.145
Babe, let's give the doctor
and his patient some privacy...

17:22.213 --> 17:23.913
- What a wonderful idea.
- So that Lance

17:23.981 --> 17:25.682
can pick Hank's huge, encyclopedic brain.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.617
Okay, thank you guys so much, really.

17:27.685 --> 17:29.586
I am sorry about that.

17:29.653 --> 17:31.488
I'm not sure why they're being so weird.

17:31.555 --> 17:33.089
What are they usually like?

17:33.157 --> 17:35.325
Uh, well, Paige is usually normal.

17:38.062 --> 17:40.096
Actually, there is something
I should probably tell you.

17:40.164 --> 17:42.232
Yeah?

17:42.299 --> 17:45.268
I didn't just fall off that
jungle gym when I was young.

17:45.336 --> 17:48.338
- My dad dropped me.
- Oh.

17:48.406 --> 17:52.308
It was the beginning of
his Huntington's Disease.

17:52.376 --> 17:54.110
You know that with Huntington's,

17:54.178 --> 17:55.779
there's a 50/50 chance of...

17:55.846 --> 17:57.313
Inheriting it from an affected parent.

17:57.381 --> 17:58.748
Yep, I know.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.651
And once you get it, it's a death sentence.

18:04.221 --> 18:08.691
My dad died less than ten
years after his diagnosis.

18:08.759 --> 18:12.562
There was so many things
he never got a chance to do.

18:12.630 --> 18:15.999
He didn't even have a bucket list.

18:16.066 --> 18:18.802
Lance, have you taken the blood test

18:18.869 --> 18:21.004
to check for the genetic mutation?

18:21.071 --> 18:22.572
No. And I won't.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.842
I don't want a Huntington's
diagnosis to control my life.

18:25.910 --> 18:29.446
If I do, then the disease kills
me before I even get sick.

18:29.513 --> 18:32.382
Well, the good news is
that your C.T. is clean.

18:32.450 --> 18:33.950
Of course it is.

18:34.018 --> 18:36.319
You're one of the ten best
doctors in the Hamptons.

19:07.551 --> 19:09.953
Oh, it's about finding the

19:13.290 --> 19:14.891
I'm gonna go get a drink at the bar.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.827
You tell Charlie Brown, if he's interested,

19:17.895 --> 19:19.696
he can come find me.

19:19.763 --> 19:22.532

Hi.

19:24.201 --> 19:26.002
Does Charlie Brown go with Sally?

19:26.070 --> 19:27.904
No. Linus.

Oh, sorry. Are you looking for a debate?

19:49.326 --> 19:51.227
He had no right to take you from Boris

19:51.295 --> 19:52.762
when I'm not even in labor.

19:52.830 --> 19:55.632
Boris is fine. I'm so happy I'm here.

19:55.699 --> 19:58.134
And happy to come back again when it's time.

19:58.202 --> 20:01.237
I wouldn't miss the birth
of your baby for anything.

20:01.305 --> 20:03.773
I'm gonna be right next to you,
watching her very first breath.

20:03.841 --> 20:06.709
Mm. Well, it means a lot that

That's a bad thing?

20:20.471 --> 20:22.906

20:36.087 --> 20:38.288
Hey, sorry, man, no more requests for now.

20:38.356 --> 20:39.656
Just... just let us surprise you.

20:39.724 --> 20:43.593
Oh. Uh, can I request speaking
to Lance for a minute?

20:43.661 --> 20:45.228
I'm a... I'm a friend of his.

20:45.296 --> 20:46.492
Oh, so you want to go over my head?

20:46.492 --> 20:47.892
- No, no, no. That's...
- That's all right.

20:47.994 --> 20:49.568
I'll hook you up, man,
if you want to hear it that bad.

20:49.657 --> 20:52.345
- It's cool.
- Okay, thank you.

20:56.662 --> 21:00.398
Lance, that was... I mean,
that was really impressive.

21:00.466 --> 21:01.966
Oh, I kind of botched that last stanza.

21:02.034 --> 21:02.967
- What?
- Good thing the drinks

21:03.035 --> 21:04.235
are strong, right?

21:04.303 --> 21:05.737
Lance, it was awesome...

21:05.804 --> 21:08.806
So awesome, in fact, I got to ask,

21:08.874 --> 21:11.743
why are you playing a winter
party at a summer resort

21:11.810 --> 21:14.612
when you could definitely be
playing a sold-out L.A. arena?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.981
This is a perfectly good gig.

21:17.049 --> 21:20.184
Yeah, sure, but is it the gig you want?

21:20.252 --> 21:21.652
You said you don't want to take the test

21:21.720 --> 21:23.121
'cause you don't want Huntington's

21:23.188 --> 21:25.223
to control your life.

21:25.290 --> 21:27.391
Is it possible that not taking the test

21:27.459 --> 21:29.627
is controlling your life even more?

21:31.363 --> 21:34.599
You've given me a lot to think about.

21:34.666 --> 21:36.734
And I will, right after this next set.

21:36.802 --> 21:38.236
Okay, good.

21:38.303 --> 21:40.304
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:48.747 --> 21:51.616
Okay, I'm done being a groupie.
How about a dance?

21:51.683 --> 21:54.786
Hank, my water just broke.

21:57.670 --> 21:59.057
Almost there. It's right here.

21:59.206 --> 22:00.913
Now, Divya, you're sure
this isn't Braxton Hicks?

22:00.913 --> 22:02.114
- Oh! Oh!
- Okay, I get it!

22:02.181 --> 22:04.950
I get it! I get it! Oh!

22:05.017 --> 22:06.384
Oh, my God.

22:06.452 --> 22:08.787
I think we made a wrong turn
into the Waldorf Astoria.

22:08.855 --> 22:11.089
Actually, the hospital gave
Divya a courtesy upgrade.

22:11.157 --> 22:13.992
Yeah, they did. Here we go. Easy, easy.

22:14.060 --> 22:16.261
- Lights dimmed to 50%, please.
- Check.

22:16.329 --> 22:19.965
My iPod set to soothing playlist number one.

22:20.032 --> 22:21.366
Check.

22:21.434 --> 22:23.368
All right, excuse me, folks.

22:23.436 --> 22:26.671
- I'm Tamara.
- Okay.

22:26.739 --> 22:28.640
Here we go. Hi, Divya.

22:28.708 --> 22:31.009
Go ahead and scooch down and
bend your knees for me, okay?

22:31.077 --> 22:33.111
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

22:33.179 --> 22:35.547
Just let your legs fall apart, all right?

22:37.950 --> 22:40.085
There we go. Wait a second. Wait a second.

22:40.153 --> 22:41.653
It's coming right now? Right this moment?

22:41.721 --> 22:43.121
It's coming out right now?

22:43.189 --> 22:45.223
Are you gonna be a problem?
Is he gonna be a problem?

22:45.291 --> 22:46.424
- He might be.
- Yeah.

22:46.492 --> 22:48.994
- We'll get the chocolate cigars.
- Or a pacifier.

22:49.061 --> 22:50.996
All right, just breathe.

22:51.063 --> 22:52.531
You're gonna feel a little bit of pressure.

22:52.598 --> 22:54.166
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, there you go.

22:54.233 --> 22:56.735
Mm-hmm.

22:56.802 --> 22:59.471
Great. Very good.

22:59.539 --> 23:01.039
8?

23:01.107 --> 23:05.177
- Okay, 7.
- 1 centimeter.

23:05.244 --> 23:07.312
I'm sorry to disappoint
you, but in my defense,

23:07.380 --> 23:08.914
your expectations are pretty high.

23:11.017 --> 23:13.518
All right, you know, 1 centimeter.

23:13.586 --> 23:16.288

Plus, he did kick off my labor,

23:38.644 --> 23:40.812
so Sashi and I figured that we owed him.

24:01.934 --> 24:03.268
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

24:03.336 --> 24:07.305
My degenerative terminal
illness is just acting up a bit.

24:07.373 --> 24:10.709
Symptoms started shortly
after I saw you last February.

24:10.776 --> 24:13.311
That's a fast progression for three months.

24:13.379 --> 24:15.714
What did Dr. Sacani say when
he followed up with you?

24:15.781 --> 24:19.084
Uh, he referred me to a
Huntington's specialist.

24:19.151 --> 24:21.953
You were right last Valentine's
about confronting the question.

24:22.021 --> 24:24.956
So, when symptoms acted
up shortly after that,

24:25.024 --> 24:27.959
I was... I was ready and
not exactly surprised.

24:28.027 --> 24:29.694
I'm just glad Divya liked the music enough

24:29.762 --> 24:30.962
to hire me back for this one.

24:31.030 --> 24:35.967
Lance, I can help you navigate this disease.

24:36.035 --> 24:39.037
- Hey, man, you got a sec?
- Yeah.

24:39.105 --> 24:41.477
Excuse me, Hank. The guys
probably want to know

24:41.544 --> 24:43.278
why I was break-dancing during my solo.

24:43.346 --> 24:46.281
Yeah. Okay.

24:57.427 --> 24:59.828
It appears I've healed just as we expected.

24:59.896 --> 25:02.264
Yeah, right.

25:02.332 --> 25:06.135
You've made this a part of
my official medical file, yes?

25:06.202 --> 25:08.804
Yes, anyone who reviews your history

25:08.872 --> 25:10.305
will see what you're seeing now.

25:10.373 --> 25:14.476
Excellent. This puts us right
on schedule for Monte Carlo.

25:14.544 --> 25:16.245
Sorry to interrupt.

25:16.312 --> 25:19.548
We were just trying to find
a place to have dinner.

25:19.616 --> 25:22.618
We'll just find another room.

25:25.855 --> 25:28.123
How long was she standing there?

25:28.191 --> 25:30.025
- I don't know.
- Did she see the X-ray?

25:30.093 --> 25:34.296
I don't know that either,
but I'll talk to her.

25:34.364 --> 25:37.733
- Don't talk to me.
- Divya, it's been six hours,

25:37.801 --> 25:39.134
and you know that pitocin is

25:39.202 --> 25:41.236
a normal, proven method
of stimulating labor.

25:41.304 --> 25:43.839
My baby will come when the time is...

25:43.907 --> 25:47.810
right!

25:52.749 --> 25:56.018
Okay,
I just think you need...

25:56.086 --> 26:00.255
Do... not... talk... to... me.

26:00.323 --> 26:02.257
Okay.

26:06.463 --> 26:09.665
Pitocin is not part of her birth plan.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.384
Oh, I assure you, it is not easy,

26:29.452 --> 26:32.087
but her smile makes it worth it. Mwah.

26:32.155 --> 26:34.189
Excuse me for one second, guys.

26:34.257 --> 26:37.392
Hi. Hi. Miss Sashi Katdare,
may I have this dance, please?

26:37.460 --> 26:39.628
And she just stopped smiling.

26:39.696 --> 26:40.796
"Evan, Evan,

26:40.864 --> 26:42.231
all the girls want to dance with you."

26:42.298 --> 26:44.533
I know, but I'm
choosing you. Can I, please?

26:44.601 --> 26:47.069
I promise to have her
back by a reasonable hour.

26:47.137 --> 26:49.738
- Watch this... master at work.
- Okay.

26:49.806 --> 26:51.106

27:12.829 --> 27:15.597

27:15.665 --> 27:18.767

27:18.835 --> 27:23.138
You don't have to apologize.

27:23.206 --> 27:25.607
But I was wondering about Boris.

27:25.675 --> 27:27.409
Oh.

27:27.477 --> 27:29.611
I saw the X-ray that he was holding.

27:29.679 --> 27:30.979
He's losing bone density,

27:31.047 --> 27:33.415
which could indicate he's
becoming symptomatic.

27:33.483 --> 27:35.450
Yeah, and... and I'm sorry if I misled you.

27:35.518 --> 27:38.187
He just... he wants to keep this very quiet.

27:38.254 --> 27:40.255
- Okay.
- Okay? Thank you.

27:42.659 --> 27:46.428
Hey. Oh, where did your friend go?

27:46.496 --> 27:48.330
- My friend?
- Yeah.

27:48.398 --> 27:50.299

27:50.366 --> 27:52.701
No. Emma said she was your friend.

27:52.769 --> 27:53.969
She told me the same thing.

27:54.037 --> 27:56.805
Emma told me she was a patient.

28:33.209 --> 28:36.011

- Does your neck hurt?

28:36.079 --> 28:37.112
- No.
- Okay.

28:37.180 --> 28:38.847

28:38.915 --> 28:40.349
Mm-hmm.

28:40.416 --> 28:42.742

- No.

28:49.037 --> 28:50.225
- Okay, and here?
- Aah!

28:50.293 --> 28:52.261
Okay, it's not his hip.
He fractured his pelvis.

28:52.328 --> 28:54.096
- Evan?
- 911, I know.

28:54.163 --> 28:56.431
We need to stop the bleeding,
or he could exsanguinate.

28:56.499 --> 28:59.668
Okay, we need to force his
pelvic ring closed, now.

28:59.736 --> 29:03.505
Uh... This could work.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.944
Aah! Aah! Okay.

29:09.012 --> 29:10.712
- Aah! What's he doing?
- Are you making

29:10.780 --> 29:12.214
a circumferential compression binder?

29:12.282 --> 29:14.283
I'm trying to, yeah.

29:14.350 --> 29:17.953
Okay. Jeremiah, can you
hold that tight? Thank you.

29:18.021 --> 29:21.256
This should work. Sorry, kitty cat.

29:22.859 --> 29:24.526
Good.

29:26.462 --> 29:28.497
- Okay, Lance?
- Yeah.

29:28.564 --> 29:31.300
- This is gonna hurt.
- Okay.

29:31.367 --> 29:33.101
Aah!

29:33.169 --> 29:36.405
Okay.

29:36.472 --> 29:39.408
- Pulse is steadying.
- Good. Good.

29:40.510 --> 29:42.444
What's gonna happen to me?

29:42.512 --> 29:43.845
Okay, the bad news is

29:43.913 --> 29:46.648
you'll need emergency
angiography with embolization

29:46.716 --> 29:48.817
and then pelvic surgery to repair the break.

29:48.885 --> 29:51.186
- Is there any good news?
- There may be.

29:51.254 --> 29:52.988
Lance, did you ever
actually see that specialist

29:53.056 --> 29:54.456
Dr. Sacani referred you to?

29:55.959 --> 29:57.993
And you never took the genetic test?

29:58.061 --> 30:01.897
- Why? To confirm the obvious?
- No, to rule it out.

30:01.965 --> 30:05.600
Lance, I don't think you
have Huntington's Disease.

30:13.034 --> 30:15.243
Will you give us a minute please?

30:16.753 --> 30:18.436
- Is she armed?
- No.

30:18.529 --> 30:20.008
- On any drugs?
- We don't believe so.

30:20.008 --> 30:22.176
Then I will be fine.

30:28.817 --> 30:31.686
I know why you're here.

30:31.753 --> 30:34.088
And you're probably
going to be really bummed

30:34.156 --> 30:36.857
when I tell you that the man
you're looking for is not.

30:36.925 --> 30:38.959
Yeah, I already found that out.

30:39.027 --> 30:40.861
It was a long trip for nothing.

30:40.929 --> 30:42.863
Even a short trip to find a famous person

30:42.931 --> 30:44.365
seems a little silly.

30:44.433 --> 30:46.267
He's more than just a famous person to me,

30:46.335 --> 30:47.601
and I'm more than just a fan.

30:47.669 --> 30:49.603
Have you ever even met him?

30:49.671 --> 30:51.138
No, that's the whole point.

30:51.206 --> 30:54.775
Well, these nice gentlemen
will be happy to drive you

30:54.843 --> 30:57.645
wherever you'd like to go,
and I am sure with time,

30:57.713 --> 31:00.214
you will outgrow this little
obsession that you have.

31:00.282 --> 31:02.950
But, please...

31:03.018 --> 31:07.621
Don't come near me or my family ever again,

31:07.689 --> 31:08.789
because the next time,

31:08.857 --> 31:11.392
these gentlemen will not be as nice,

31:11.460 --> 31:13.828
and nor will I.

31:16.698 --> 31:19.633
She's all yours.

31:30.345 --> 31:32.513
- Hey, Lance.
- Hey.

31:32.581 --> 31:34.248
Whoa.

31:34.316 --> 31:36.817
Did you get your pelvis fixed,
or are you just happy to see us?

31:39.254 --> 31:41.188
Am I happy to see you?

31:41.256 --> 31:44.125
So, Lance, the angiogram shows

31:44.192 --> 31:46.861
your symptoms have been caused by moyamoya,

31:46.928 --> 31:48.996
which is Japanese for "puff of smoke."

31:49.064 --> 31:51.132
Wow. One more reason to quit.

31:51.199 --> 31:53.401
Uh, no, it's not actual smoke.

31:53.468 --> 31:55.569
It's a bunch of small
blood vessels that form

31:55.637 --> 31:59.473
to compensate for a blockage
in the carotid artery.

31:59.541 --> 32:01.942
How did you figure it was moyamoya?

32:02.010 --> 32:05.012
Well, during your solo, I saw
you not getting enough oxygen,

32:05.080 --> 32:08.849
and hypoxia is not a symptom
of Huntington's, so...

32:08.917 --> 32:10.818
So what caused the blockage?

32:10.886 --> 32:13.287
Hard to say for sure,
but it might have formed

32:13.355 --> 32:17.391
when your dad dropped
you from the jungle gym.

32:18.794 --> 32:22.430
So I did get a condition from my father.

32:22.497 --> 32:24.565
Speaking of which...

32:27.469 --> 32:29.303
Your blood work came back.

32:30.872 --> 32:32.573
Now, I just need to confirm

32:32.641 --> 32:35.142
that you want the result
of your Huntington's test.

32:37.646 --> 32:40.381
- I do.
- Okay.

32:49.157 --> 32:51.258
Wow.

32:51.326 --> 32:52.626
Wow.

32:52.694 --> 32:54.161
Thank you, Hank.

32:56.064 --> 32:58.165
Really.

32:58.233 --> 33:01.502
I was so sure I had it, I...

33:01.570 --> 33:04.839
I avoided the opportunity
to be proven wrong.

33:04.906 --> 33:07.208
And in the process,

33:07.275 --> 33:09.109
I avoided a lot of other opportunities too.

33:09.177 --> 33:11.011
Well, you just need a procedure

33:11.079 --> 33:13.214
to correct the blockage, and after that...

33:13.281 --> 33:15.449
I can finally pursue the career I want.

33:15.517 --> 33:17.885
So the next time the piano man calls...

33:17.953 --> 33:20.421
Kitty cat and I will answer.

33:21.857 --> 33:24.859
About kitty cat, uh, medically speaking,

33:24.926 --> 33:26.794
she didn't fare quite as well as you.

33:26.862 --> 33:30.030
Oh, no. Well, she had a good run.

33:30.098 --> 33:33.067
She did. She did.

33:35.337 --> 33:38.172
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.673
Why'd you, uh, step out?

33:39.741 --> 33:42.109
I just wanted to give a doctor
and his patient some privacy,

33:42.177 --> 33:44.011
- you know.
- Oh, well, thank you.

33:44.079 --> 33:45.546
Good thing for him you were around.

33:45.614 --> 33:48.549
Yeah, well, you know,
I caught a lucky break.

33:48.617 --> 33:51.252
Don't worry. That was just a compliment.

33:51.319 --> 33:52.820
That was not me trying to get you

33:52.888 --> 33:54.588
to stick around like before, okay?

33:54.656 --> 33:57.157
- No, I...
- No, I get it.

33:57.225 --> 33:59.426
You... you're a different
kind of doctor now.

33:59.494 --> 34:00.761
It's... it's cool.

34:00.829 --> 34:02.830
No, that's not true, Ev. I'm not.

34:10.839 --> 34:14.241
You should take it. It's
probably someone important.

34:20.649 --> 34:23.449
Dilated to 5 centimeters.

34:23.518 --> 34:24.885
- At least there's progress.
- Yeah.

34:24.953 --> 34:27.321
But the baby's now in the
occiput posterior position,

34:27.389 --> 34:32.159
and as you well know, delivering
sunny-side up can be very risky.

34:32.226 --> 34:35.062
Divya, it's been nine hours.
You have a slight fever.

34:35.130 --> 34:36.397
I really think you need to consider...

34:36.464 --> 34:38.165
Divya has a very specific birth plan.

34:38.233 --> 34:40.000
Okay, well, sometimes plans have to change.

34:40.068 --> 34:42.835
I'd like to try different laboring positions

34:42.904 --> 34:45.005
- to adjust the baby.
- Okay.

34:45.072 --> 34:46.607
I'll be back in a few hours, then.

34:46.675 --> 34:47.875
Okay.

34:52.781 --> 34:55.882
- Hank, just take the call.
- No, no, no, I can't leave now.

34:55.951 --> 34:59.253
Unfortunately, this is gonna be a while.

34:59.321 --> 35:01.956
- Okay, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

35:02.023 --> 35:04.091
Yeah?

35:04.159 --> 35:06.026
Oh, easy.

35:13.068 --> 35:14.835
Uh, now... now rotate your hips.

35:20.108 --> 35:22.743
Maybe more like you're hula-hooping.

35:22.811 --> 35:24.411
I've never used a hula hoop.

35:34.689 --> 35:37.558
Me neither.

35:39.461 --> 35:41.795
A wire must have come loose.

35:43.665 --> 35:45.399
No, the baby's heart rate is dropping.

35:45.467 --> 35:47.001
- Is dropping to what?
- It's...

35:47.068 --> 35:49.003
The baby is in distress,
and your B.P. is dropping.

35:49.070 --> 35:51.171
- A placental abruption?
- It's possible.

35:51.239 --> 35:53.207
Let's get that C-section now.

35:53.274 --> 35:54.375
There's a lot happening here too,

35:54.442 --> 35:56.176
so just tell me what's going on.

35:56.244 --> 35:59.680
It's begun. I've broken my leg.

35:59.748 --> 36:01.915
You broke it now?

36:01.983 --> 36:05.119
Wait a second. Is this... are you sure?

36:05.186 --> 36:06.420
Hank, it's broken.

36:06.488 --> 36:08.155
O...

36:12.727 --> 36:13.761
Okay.

36:13.828 --> 36:15.596
Okay, I can be on the jet tomorrow.

36:15.664 --> 36:16.864
Make it tonight, please.

36:16.931 --> 36:18.298
No, Boris, I said tomorrow,

36:18.366 --> 36:20.367
and I really can't sit here
arguing with you about it.

36:20.435 --> 36:21.969
I think I made myself quite clear.

36:22.037 --> 36:23.804
Yeah, you have.

36:37.085 --> 36:38.519
Tamara! She's in the O.R...

36:38.586 --> 36:41.221
Emergency C-section.

36:49.431 --> 36:52.599
Here is your perfect baby.

36:52.667 --> 36:54.401
Hi.

36:54.469 --> 36:56.603
- Oh, my God!
- Hi.

37:18.359 --> 37:20.861
Sobald die arzt bereit ist.

37:20.929 --> 37:22.496
Ah.

37:22.564 --> 37:24.598
Where is your bag?

37:26.501 --> 37:28.969
I can't come to terms with leaving again.

37:29.037 --> 37:31.390
You made a commitment to me, Hank,

37:31.809 --> 37:34.095
and we have a very specific plan.

37:34.212 --> 37:35.815
sometimes plans have to change.

37:36.015 --> 37:37.196
I'll still fly to wherever I need to

37:37.264 --> 37:38.831
to continue administering the monthly dose

37:38.899 --> 37:41.000
- of your trial medication.
- It's not just about the trial.

37:41.068 --> 37:43.369
- And you know it.
- I do...

37:43.437 --> 37:45.838
which is why I should've
stayed behind the last time.

37:45.906 --> 37:47.173
Is this about your patients here?

37:47.240 --> 37:49.275
It's about them and much more.

37:49.343 --> 37:52.378
I don't want to be a
helicopter physician anymore.

37:52.446 --> 37:53.979
You can be any kind of physician you like

37:54.047 --> 37:55.981
after we've fulfilled our objectives.

37:56.049 --> 37:59.452
I'll see you on board.
We leave in ten minutes.

37:59.519 --> 38:02.888
Come to terms with that however you like.

38:10.863 --> 38:12.480
- I mean, look...
- I can't look,

38:12.561 --> 38:14.324
'cause I'm trying to look at the ball, okay?

38:16.925 --> 38:18.459
- Don't get me wrong. I'm...
- Okay.

38:18.527 --> 38:21.396
I'm thrilled you're back.

38:21.463 --> 38:24.432
I just want to know why
you changed your mind.

38:27.469 --> 38:30.805
Helping Lance made me remember
what I've been missing.

38:30.873 --> 38:33.708
Good.

38:33.776 --> 38:36.811
What about Boris?

38:36.879 --> 38:39.680
He's a patient too. He's the patient.

38:39.748 --> 38:43.384
He's top priority around here, right?

38:43.452 --> 38:46.421
Yeah, Boris is a...

38:46.488 --> 38:47.622
complicated man.

38:47.689 --> 38:50.525
That's a groundbreaking insight.

38:50.592 --> 38:52.026
Thank you.

38:52.094 --> 38:53.761
I'm gonna more beer now.

38:53.829 --> 38:55.763
Maybe if I get you drunk,

38:55.831 --> 38:57.932
I'll get a straight answer out of you.

39:11.197 --> 39:13.717
__

39:18.387 --> 39:19.454
- Mama?
- Hmm?

39:19.521 --> 39:22.323
- I'll be back.
- Okay, baby.

39:29.798 --> 39:32.099
So...

39:32.167 --> 39:34.602
- I had a major epiphany.
- Yeah? When?

39:34.670 --> 39:36.938
- Over the winter?
- No, just now in the kitchen.

39:37.005 --> 39:38.806
Oh, you found beer and enlightenment.

39:38.874 --> 39:40.374
I realized it doesn't matter about Boris.

39:40.442 --> 39:42.109
I'm just happy the family's back together.

39:42.177 --> 39:44.612
- Yeah.
- We're together.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.113
You and me are back together again.

39:47.516 --> 39:50.017
Things are finally back
to normal around here.

39:50.085 --> 39:51.519
To normal.

39:56.024 --> 39:58.226
In fact, I'm ready for
that "welcome home" hug.

39:58.293 --> 40:00.495
Actually, I'm good now, but thank you.

40:09.538 --> 40:12.240
Ah, come on.

40:16.111 --> 40:17.378
I missed you, bro.

40:17.446 --> 40:20.014
I missed you too, but this
is as long as it should be,

40:20.082 --> 40:21.682
- I think.
- Two more seconds.

40:21.750 --> 40:22.950
Okay.

40:23.018 --> 40:23.951
- And I'm...
- Make that six.

40:24.019 --> 40:25.019
I'm really... I'm good.

40:25.087 --> 40:26.087
- Make that eight.
- All right.

40:39.434 --> 40:41.669
Emma.

40:41.737 --> 40:43.871
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, that's funny.

40:43.939 --> 40:45.740
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

40:45.807 --> 40:47.542
I thought you knew why I was here.

40:47.609 --> 40:51.445
I thought so too, but you're
not Rafa's stalker, are you?

40:51.513 --> 40:54.382
Stalker? What? Who's Rafa?

40:55.918 --> 41:00.078
Emma, who were you looking
for today at Shadow Pond?

41:00.291 --> 41:02.091
I was looking for my father.

41:03.246 --> 41:04.554
Your father?

41:07.260 --> 41:08.847
Well, who is your father?

41:24.861 --> 41:28.130
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

41:28.197 --> 41:29.998
What's going on?

41:32.168 --> 41:34.469
Hank, this is Emma.

41:34.537 --> 41:36.371
Hi.

41:36.439 --> 41:40.742
The famous/notorious Emma.

41:40.810 --> 41:44.846
I've heard many different things about you.

41:44.914 --> 41:47.950
Well, Emma has another one

41:48.017 --> 41:51.153
to add to the list... the truth.
