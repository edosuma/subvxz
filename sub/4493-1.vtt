fabulous place, New York</i>

07:22.568 --> 07:26.656
<i>You busy, dizzy, razzle-dazzle
scandalous place, New York</i>

07:31.452 --> 07:34.622
<i>Dolls with hidden talent

07:34.705 --> 07:37.250
<i>Take off for Broadway
by taxi, by subway</i>

07:37.333 --> 07:39.794
<i>And land on the town
A merry-go-round</i>

07:41.879 --> 07:45.716
<i>Where millionaires and Cinderellas
rendezvous at the Stork</i>

07:47.552 --> 07:53.391
<i>In Central Park romantic babies

07:54.767 --> 07:58.479
<i>Crazy city with its hat

<i>Noisy city with

08:01.566 --> 08:04.443
<i>Doorway to glory

08:04.527 --> 08:08.239
<i>You'll never get your fill of it

<i>Glorious, glamorous wonderland</i>

<i>New York</i>

08:20.418 --> 08:24.380
Oh, is Mr. Benton here yet,
the agent for the apartments?

08:24.463 --> 08:26.465
Oh, yes. He's in there
waiting for you now.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.302
Thank you.

08:29.385 --> 08:31.304
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Page.

08:31.387 --> 08:33.306
I do hope I haven't
kept you waiting too long.

08:33.389 --> 08:36.225
Not in the least. I'm afraid I have
a little disappointment for you, though.

08:36.308 --> 08:40.020
You won't be able to meet Mr. Denmark.
He flew to Europe this morning.

08:40.104 --> 08:42.982
Oh, dear, I am disappointed.
Wasn't that awfully sudden?

08:43.065 --> 08:47.778
Oh, very. You know how those income tax
people are when you skip a whole year.

08:49.947 --> 08:54.035
And the result, of course, is that
a longer lease is now possible.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.581
Open, if you don't mind.

08:58.664 --> 09:02.460
Oh, oh, certainly. Certainly.

09:09.133 --> 09:13.888
How long a lease? Not that it matters
if he's to insist on a thousand a month.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.682
That's what I wanted to
see him about, personally.

09:16.766 --> 09:18.935
Oh, he won't be needing
the place for years now.

09:19.018 --> 09:22.396
I hear Mr. Whiskers really
blew his top this time.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.857
You mean he can't come back
to this country?

09:24.941 --> 09:27.902
It would be I understand
the very height of folly.

09:27.985 --> 09:33.324
Oh, I see. Well, it throws
an entirely different light.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.326
Where's that lease?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.536
Well, I'm afraid
I haven't got it with me.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.747
Oh, never mind.
You can mail it to me.

09:39.830 --> 09:43.167
This is for two months,
the first and the last.

09:43.251 --> 09:45.628
- That's the deal, isn't it?
- That's correct.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.755
How soon would you like
to take possession?

09:47.838 --> 09:50.508
Oh, anything wrong
with right now?

09:50.591 --> 09:53.761
Nothing at all. It's a little unusual,
of course, but...

09:53.844 --> 09:56.264
Thank you so much, Mr. Benton.
You've been awfully kind.

09:56.347 --> 09:58.391
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Page.

09:58.474 --> 10:01.269
It's a genuine pleasure to do business
with a woman of such decision.

10:01.352 --> 10:03.688
- We in the real estate game...
- Bye now.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.649
Oh, yes, of course. Well.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.735
Oh, I almost forgot.
How long shall I make the lease for?

10:09.819 --> 10:11.779
Oh, a year will be quite enough.
Thank you.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.115
But don't you think
you oughta have it...

10:31.048 --> 10:33.217
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Bingo.

10:33.301 --> 10:35.303
<i>I'll be right over.</i>

10:40.599 --> 10:43.561
- To the left.
- Thanks.

10:55.906 --> 10:58.993
All right, put 'em on.
No men here yet.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.329
You certainly got here in a hurry.
Did you take a taxi?

11:01.412 --> 11:03.789
No, I didn't have
enough money for a taxi

11:03.873 --> 11:08.002
I had the Chrysler people demonstrate
that new showboat for me again.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.671
- The one with the gold trim?
- Was it gold?

11:10.755 --> 11:13.382
I didn't want to put on my specs
with the driver there, you know.

11:13.466 --> 11:16.302
The one they sent for me
had gold trim.

11:18.888 --> 11:20.806
Brother!

11:20.890 --> 11:22.808
Smooth, huh?

11:22.892 --> 11:26.020
Creamy. Are we really in?

11:26.103 --> 11:28.856
- Built in.
- I'll call Loco.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.858
Loco who?

11:30.941 --> 11:33.569
You know, that girl
I was telling you about from Jersey.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.571
You didn't tell me
her name was "Loco."

11:35.654 --> 11:40.034
It isn't. That's what the other models
call her. It means crazy, you know?

11:40.117 --> 11:42.036
That's what I know.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.038
<i>- Hello?
- Bingo!</i>

11:44.121 --> 11:46.040
- Hold that for a minute.
- Just a minute, Loke.

11:46.123 --> 11:49.460
I can't shack up with a dame I haven't
even met, and she's crazy too.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.838
You don't have to. All I'm going to
ask her is to come up here.

11:52.922 --> 11:55.049
If you don't like her,
that's the end of it.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.968
- Is she class?
- Is she. Didn't I tell you?

11:58.052 --> 12:00.846
She's been on the cover of
Harper's Bazaar three times already.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.848
And she knows how to handle it?

12:02.932 --> 12:06.977
- Well, let's see if she does. Loke?
<i>- Yes?</i>

12:07.061 --> 12:09.397
- How much money you got?
<i>- I've</i> got a quarter.

12:09.480 --> 12:14.860
That's wonderful. Stop in on your way
up here and pick up lunch for us.

12:14.944 --> 12:16.862
<i>- How many?
- Three.</i>

12:16.946 --> 12:19.490
<i>Okay. Just as soon
as I get something on.</i>

12:19.573 --> 12:24.078
There's a fine contribution to a million
dollar proposition, one whole quarter.

12:24.161 --> 12:29.625
Maybe, but she's awful
clever with a quarter.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.171
I just don't know how I'll ever
be able to thank you enough.

12:34.255 --> 12:36.590
I'm still so embarrassed.

12:36.674 --> 12:40.302
You have no reason to be. Anybody can
forget their money. I've done it myself.

12:40.386 --> 12:43.431
I know, but...
Oh, hi, honey.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.891
- Come on in.
- Come in.

12:45.975 --> 12:48.602
This is a gentleman I met
at the cold cuts counter.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.771
- What did you say your name was?
- Tom Brookman.

12:50.855 --> 12:53.107
B-R-O-O-K-M-A-N.
Brookman.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.443
Well, this is my friend,
Miss Pola Debevoise.

12:55.526 --> 12:58.112
- How do you do?
- Oh, and this is Miss Page, isn't it?

12:58.195 --> 13:01.907
- Mrs. Page.
- How do you do? It was very funny.

13:01.991 --> 13:04.076
I was ordering some pastrami
and potato salad,

13:04.160 --> 13:06.537
and I heard Miss Dempsey explaining
she only had a quarter...

13:06.620 --> 13:08.539
You can just set that down.
We'll take it from here.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.916
Oh, wouldn't you like me
to put them in the kitchen?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.752
No, I don't think you'd better.
The cook's not dressed.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.630
- Oh, really?
- Thank you very much.

13:16.714 --> 13:20.134
Some other day.
Give us a ring next week.

13:20.217 --> 13:23.179
- I don't know your number.
- That's all right. It's in the book.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.181
Thank you very much,
Mr. Brookman.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.392
- But I don't know your first name.
- He was really very nice.

13:28.476 --> 13:30.394
I thought he might
have lunch with us.

13:30.478 --> 13:33.105
Look, the first rule of this proposition
is that gentleman callers

13:33.189 --> 13:35.149
have got to wear a necktie.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.486
I don't want to be snobbish,
but if we begin with characters like that,

13:38.569 --> 13:42.156
we might just as well
throw in the towel right now

14:00.299 --> 14:02.760
Thanks, Mick. Keep the change.

14:04.512 --> 14:07.264
- How do, Mr. Brookman?
- Hiya, Pete.

14:11.393 --> 14:14.897
The next thing to remember is
a gentleman you meet among cold cuts

14:14.980 --> 14:17.233
is simply not as attractive
as one that you meet,

14:17.316 --> 14:19.401
say in the mink department
at Bergdorf's.

14:19.485 --> 14:21.403
But he was cute,
don't you think?

14:21.487 --> 14:25.491
Sure he was, but then I never met one
of those gas pump jockeys that wasn't.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.993
- Is that what he is?
- You bet your life.

14:28.077 --> 14:32.540
I know those guys. I married one once.
Very, very cute fellow.

14:32.623 --> 14:35.876
- I didn't know you were really married.
- Just got back from Reno.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.504
Oh, then you must be loaded.

14:38.587 --> 14:43.092
Mine was one of those divorces you don't
read about. The wife finished second.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.636
But that's against the law, isn't it?

14:45.719 --> 14:49.431
I was absolutely nuts about that guy,
and you know what he did to me?

14:49.515 --> 14:51.600
First off, he gives me
a phony name.

14:51.684 --> 14:54.144
Second, it turns out
he was already married yet.

14:54.228 --> 14:56.397
Third, from the minute
the preacher said, "Amen,"

14:56.480 --> 14:58.941
he never did
another tap of work.

14:59.024 --> 15:02.945
The next thing I knew he'd stolen my
television set and given it to a carhop.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.656
When I ask him how about that,
he hits me with a chicken.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.784
- A live chicken?
- No, a baked chicken, stuffed.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.287
He sounds incompatible to me.

15:11.370 --> 15:16.709
Last I saw of him, I stepped out of
the car for a minute at a gas station.

15:16.792 --> 15:18.711
I had to walk home.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.755
Well, I'm surprised
you'd ever want to get married again.

15:21.839 --> 15:25.134
Oh, but that's the point
about this whole setup.

15:25.217 --> 15:27.261
Of course I want to
get married again.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.929
Who doesn't?

15:29.013 --> 15:31.849
It's the biggest thing
you can do in life.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.438
The way most people go about it,
they use more brains

15:37.521 --> 15:40.608
picking a horse in the third at Belmont
than they do picking a husband.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.693
- Do they really?
- It's your head you've got to use,

15:42.776 --> 15:45.154
- not your heart.
- Oh, I see.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.948
Tell her your idea
about this apartment.

15:48.032 --> 15:50.326
Well, to put it simply,
the idea is this.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.870
If you had your choice
of everybody in the world,

15:52.953 --> 15:56.040
which would you rather marry,
a rich guy or a poor one?

15:56.123 --> 15:58.042
I think I'd rather marry a rich one.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.961
All right. Where would you
be most likely to meet a rich one,

16:01.045 --> 16:04.798
in a walk-up on Amsterdam Avenue
or in a joint like this?

16:04.882 --> 16:06.800
Well...

16:06.884 --> 16:08.802
I should say in a joint like this.

16:08.886 --> 16:11.639
Okay, then, that's it.
We're all working steady,

16:11.722 --> 16:14.266
so we throw everything
we make into the kitty,

16:14.350 --> 16:16.602
and get a little organization
into this marriage caper.

16:16.685 --> 16:20.439
Class address, class background,
class characters.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.817
To be specific about it,
nothing under six figures a year.

16:23.901 --> 16:26.278
I've never heard anything
so intelligent in my life.

16:26.362 --> 16:28.906
If you want to catch a mouse,
you set a mousetrap.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.824
So, all right,
we set a bear trap.

16:30.908 --> 16:34.078
All we've got to do is one of us
has got to knock off a bear.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.330
- You mean marry him?
- If you don't marry him,

16:36.413 --> 16:39.458
you haven't caught him,
he's caught you.

16:39.541 --> 16:43.337
All my life, ever since I was a little
girl, I've had the same dream,

16:43.420 --> 16:46.465
to marry a zillionaire.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.467
Do you know who I'd like to marry?

16:48.550 --> 16:50.469
- Who?
- Rockefeller.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.847
- Which one?
- I don't care.

16:53.931 --> 16:56.725
I wouldn't mind marrying
a Vanderbilt.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.977
Or a Mr. Cadillac.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.271
No such person. I checked.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.774
Is there a Mr. Texaco?

17:03.857 --> 17:08.194
No. But how about one
of those rich maharajas?

17:08.278 --> 17:10.196
How about three of them?

17:10.280 --> 17:13.450
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had three
of them for dinner and they married us?

17:13.534 --> 17:15.536
Think of all those
diamonds and rubies.

17:15.618 --> 17:19.873
And all those crazy elephants.

17:19.957 --> 17:22.710
This is really living it up, isn't it?

17:22.792 --> 17:25.546
People that live any other way
are just crazy.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.548
I wonder who's going to pay for it.

17:27.631 --> 17:30.259
- Yeah, how about that?
- Well, I'll tell you.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.469
I knew it couldn't last.

17:32.553 --> 17:36.473
Relax, will you? And somebody
break open that other bottle.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.315
Good afternoon. I'm Mr. Bennett
of the Bennett Music Company.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.317
- Are you the lady...
- That's right. Come right in.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.486
Thank you.

17:51.155 --> 17:53.073
The reason I called you is,

17:53.157 --> 17:56.994
what will you give me
for this piano, cash?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.372
Well,

18:00.456 --> 18:02.833
it's a very handsome instrument.

18:07.671 --> 18:11.842
Really, Pola, I think she's the most
intelligent person I guess I ever met.

18:13.761 --> 18:16.722
Well, it's not in first-class condition,
you understand,

18:16.805 --> 18:21.393
but we might be interested
in paying you, say 2,500?

18:21.477 --> 18:24.146
We'll take it.

18:28.025 --> 18:31.695
Well, kids,
where will we eat tonight,

18:31.779 --> 18:33.697
the Stork or 21?

18:53.634 --> 18:56.178
Hello?

18:56.261 --> 18:59.139
<i>Is this Trafalgar 7-5098?</i>

18:59.223 --> 19:01.308
<i>- Yes?
- Who's this, Miss Page?</i>

19:01.391 --> 19:04.770
<i>- Yes, who is this?
- This is Tom Brookman.</i>

19:04.853 --> 19:06.897
- Oh.
- You remember me.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.650
- Oh, sure, but...
- Well, I kept thinking about you,

19:09.733 --> 19:13.487
but I didn't realize who you were till I
picked up an old magazine this morning.

19:13.570 --> 19:17.032
<i>- What</i> do you mean?
- You were Miss Steinbach Beer last year.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.660
Why, yes, I believe I was.

19:19.743 --> 19:23.038
<i>And isn't that you jumping around in
a girdle in all those ads in magazines?</i>

19:23.121 --> 19:26.708
I wouldn't exactly call it "jumping around."
I'm supposed to be dancing.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.295
Reason I called, I was wondering if you
wouldn't have dinner with me some night.

19:30.379 --> 19:33.549
Whatever night you say.
What about tonight?

19:33.632 --> 19:36.677
- I'm afraid I can't tonight.
<i>- Tomorrow night?</i>

19:36.760 --> 19:40.264
<i>- I'm sorry.
- What about Thursday night?</i>

19:40.347 --> 19:44.935
Mr. Brookman, you're wasting your time
on this number. Don't call it again.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.534
Hey, kid!

20:00.617 --> 20:02.870
- Pola?
- Yes?

20:06.290 --> 20:09.251
Do you think we'll ever be able
to get this job off the ground?

20:09.334 --> 20:11.420
- What do you mean?
- Here we are nearly three months,

20:11.503 --> 20:14.715
and we can't even get ourselves
engaged, much less married.

20:14.798 --> 20:18.719
- I could have got engaged last week.
- To?

20:18.802 --> 20:21.221
- That English fellow.
- What English fellow?

20:21.305 --> 20:24.892
You know, that tall one that
borrowed five dollars from me.

20:24.975 --> 20:28.520
That's what I mean. Here we are
set up strictly for the carriage train,

20:28.604 --> 20:31.815
and what do we get, you hook a schnook
who takes you for a fin,

20:31.899 --> 20:34.401
I get an invitation
to Hamburger Heaven for dinner,

20:34.484 --> 20:37.946
and Loco shows up every evening with
a gentleman she's met in the drugstore,

20:38.030 --> 20:41.408
with five more shower caps
and three quarts of aspirin tablets.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.661
And where do you think
that's gonna get us?

20:44.745 --> 20:48.498
I don't think it's us.
I think it's the men these days.

20:48.582 --> 20:52.544
They're getting more and more nervous,
especially the loaded ones.

20:52.628 --> 20:55.464
Meanwhile, where are
we gonna sit next week?

20:55.547 --> 20:58.091
Well, we're both trying, you know.

20:58.175 --> 21:00.636
It isn't always easy
to find out right away

21:00.719 --> 21:03.096
how much they're worth
or if they're married or not.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.891
They look at you like you're
prying into their private affairs.

21:06.016 --> 21:09.770
Something's got to break soon,
or we're gonna be out on the sidewalk.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.648
And all we need, you know,
is just one.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.108
That's the beautiful thing
about a bear trap.

21:15.192 --> 21:17.611
You don't have to catch
a whole herd of them,

21:17.694 --> 21:21.031
all you need is
one nice, big, fat one.

21:23.241 --> 21:27.037
Probably Miss Perth Amboy again
with another load of dollar-day Kleenex.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.378
Thanks.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.463
- Oh, hello, Schatze.
- Hello.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.466
This is... I'm sorry.
What did you say your name was?

21:39.549 --> 21:41.718
- Hanley. J.D. Hanley.
- Of course.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.304
This is Schatze Page,
and this is Pola Debevoise.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.306
- How do you do?
- How do you do, ladies?

21:46.390 --> 21:49.559
I met Mr. Hanley
in the mink department at Bergdorf's.

21:49.643 --> 21:52.229
- Really?
- Yes, the clerk was nice enough to...

21:52.312 --> 21:54.231
You'll have to excuse
the state of this apartment.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.233
We've just sent everything out
to be cleaned.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.986
But if you don't mind
coming into the dining room.

21:59.069 --> 22:01.113
Oh, of course not.

22:06.034 --> 22:09.162
And with the maid off today,
we're roughing it, you might say.

22:09.246 --> 22:12.207
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you very much, but I can't stay.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.960
I just came along to help
Miss Dempsey with her bundle.

22:15.043 --> 22:17.713
Mr. Hanley's from Dallas, Texas.

22:17.796 --> 22:21.091
Oh, really?
In the oil business?

22:21.174 --> 22:23.552
Oh, a little oil, but mostly stock.

22:23.635 --> 22:26.847
- Stocks and bonds?
- No, none of that sort of thing for me.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.516
My stock is
white-faced Hereford, polled.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.518
- Come again?
- Cattle.

22:31.601 --> 22:34.396
- You know, like cows.
- Oh, I see.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.232
Are you sure you won't sit down
for just a little while?

22:37.315 --> 22:41.486
Oh, I haven't time right now. But what
I was talking to Miss Dempsey about,

22:41.570 --> 22:44.865
there's a little organization that
I'm a member of, the Oil Institute.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.492
Kind of elder statesmen
of the business.

22:47.576 --> 22:49.703
We're having a little informal
reception tonight.

22:49.786 --> 22:52.372
If you young ladies would
honor us with your presence,

22:52.456 --> 22:54.708
I'm sure you'd make us
all very happy, indeed.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.877
Do you mean
nothing but oil men?

22:56.960 --> 23:00.338
Well, not exactly.
Probably a few bankers too.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.340
Well, bankers will be all right.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.092
- Don't you think?
- Naturally.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.636
I realize this is a little sudden
and unconventional,

23:06.720 --> 23:10.348
but there will be dancing and
a few drinks and a few laughs perhaps.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.393
- Sounds just creamy to me.
- I like laughs.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.437
- Well, then it's a deal?
- I'd love it.

23:15.520 --> 23:19.024
That's wonderful. I'll pick you up
around 8:30, if that's all right.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.234
Will we meet some of
the other gentlemen too?

23:21.318 --> 23:25.238
Oh, all of them. And don't worry,
they're not all old crooks like me.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.699
- What on earth!
- Stop it!

23:27.783 --> 23:29.868
You look just in the prime to me.

23:29.951 --> 23:35.582
Thank you, ladies. You've already
made my trip to New York worthwhile.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.709
Bye now.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.724
I think this is it, kids.

23:52.808 --> 23:56.353
A great big room full of nothing
but rich millionaires

23:56.436 --> 23:58.647
and us.

24:05.529 --> 24:08.782
This brings us down to 1947.

24:08.865 --> 24:11.409
I think it's a very good idea.
Where should we go?

24:11.493 --> 24:13.620
Well, there's a new place...

24:17.666 --> 24:19.793
Good evening, madame.
Good evening, sir.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.878
- Table for two.
- Certainly, sir.

24:21.962 --> 24:24.172
This way, madame.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.894
- Champagne?
- We might as well.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.483
Oh, a table for two, Philip.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.652
Certainly, madame.
Will you come this way?

24:45.735 --> 24:48.196
- The best, you know.
- Certainly, sir.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.367
The best we have, sir.

24:55.328 --> 24:58.165
- A quart of champagne.
- What kind, sir?

24:58.248 --> 25:00.208
- The best you've got.
- Very good, sir.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.087
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Two, please.

25:04.171 --> 25:06.381
This way, please.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.306
- This way, my dear.
- I'm so sorry.

25:17.809 --> 25:20.187
Oh, I am sorry.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.865
Did you say
you were alone here?

25:31.948 --> 25:34.910
Oh, there's quite a party
of us up from Texas.

25:34.993 --> 25:37.954
- All men?
- Oh, some wives too.

25:38.038 --> 25:41.833
You met some of them this evening.
The others went to a show.

25:41.917 --> 25:44.419
You know how the women are
when they get to New York.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.421
I know.

25:46.504 --> 25:49.549
I think Ella has seen five shows
in the last three days.

25:49.633 --> 25:52.552
- I see.
- Ella's my daughter.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.721
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

25:54.804 --> 25:57.849
Is Mrs. Merrill here with you?

25:57.933 --> 26:02.062
There is no Mrs. Merrill,
and I live in New York.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.731
Does that clear the situation
a bit for you?

26:04.814 --> 26:07.734
Oh, yes, indeedy, it does.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.736
Are you married?

26:09.819 --> 26:15.033
Married? I sometimes think
I'm the most married man in the U.S.A.

26:15.116 --> 26:18.787
Do you know how many females were
at my house when I left there tonight?

26:18.870 --> 26:21.331
No. I can't say that I do.

26:21.414 --> 26:25.919
Seven, my wife, her sister,
who's divorced.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.964
And I don't blame the guy
for a second.

26:29.047 --> 26:32.592
Their mother, who must be 110
if she's a day.

26:32.676 --> 26:36.429
An aunt from
North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

26:36.513 --> 26:39.808
And three more whose names
I didn't even catch.

26:39.891 --> 26:42.602
To tell the truth, I...

26:42.686 --> 26:45.105
I never really felt the loneliness
of being a widower

26:45.188 --> 26:48.108
until the past few years.

26:48.191 --> 26:51.945
At first, there were children,
you know, to keep me company.

26:52.028 --> 26:57.284
But they're grown up now.
My son's married. Ella's engaged.

26:57.367 --> 27:01.705
I must confess the house is beginning
to seem pretty big and empty.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.707
I can imagine.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.543
I suppose that's why I've done
so much travelling lately.

27:06.626 --> 27:10.213
London, south of France,
Scotland and so on.

27:10.297 --> 27:12.215
That's really no good, you know.

27:12.299 --> 27:15.343
Oh, no, I know. No good at all.

27:15.427 --> 27:17.804
Couple of years ago,
I chartered a boat.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.473
Not large, but quite comfortable.

27:20.557 --> 27:24.144
Took about six months,
just loafing around the world.

27:24.227 --> 27:27.188
But it was no use.

27:27.272 --> 27:31.693
I suppose there's really only
one cure for loneliness.

27:31.776 --> 27:35.030
- Yes?
- Human companionship.

27:35.113 --> 27:39.075
Oh, but you're so right.
You just don't know how right you are.

27:39.159 --> 27:42.662
I'm not accustomed really to going out
publicly with a married man.

27:42.746 --> 27:45.248
And if I'd had a chance
to ask you at the party,

27:45.332 --> 27:47.584
I don't know that I would have
accompanied you here.

27:47.667 --> 27:50.253
Well, this is all quite innocent, isn't it?

27:50.337 --> 27:55.300
If it is, it's the first time I ever
ran into it under similar circumstances.

27:57.385 --> 28:00.722
Of course, my first impulse was
to go directly to Arabia myself

28:00.805 --> 28:03.058
and take a good look-see
at the situation.

28:03.141 --> 28:06.019
I was certain those chaps from Socony
Standard of New Jersey...

28:06.102 --> 28:08.021
would have somebody on the spot.

28:08.104 --> 28:11.232
After all, there's quite
a tidy little sum involved,

28:11.316 --> 28:14.194
two or three hundred million.

28:14.277 --> 28:18.948
- I wasn't going to take any chances.
- Well, naturally.

28:19.074 --> 28:23.244
Trouble is it looks like I've got a thing
for guys who work in gas stations.

28:23.328 --> 28:26.039
I never met one yet
that didn't send me.

28:26.122 --> 28:29.209
This one handled a pump
for Standard Oil.

28:29.292 --> 28:31.711
You don't own that, do you?

28:31.795 --> 28:35.548
Oh, no, no. Standard Oil
is one of the interests

28:35.632 --> 28:38.635
of a man named,
I believe, Rockefeller.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.637
Is he a friend of yours?

28:40.720 --> 28:43.056
No, no, I'm afraid not.

28:45.058 --> 28:47.227
Oh, well. But as I was saying...

28:47.310 --> 28:49.604
When you live in
a lunatic asylum like that,

28:49.687 --> 28:52.148
you've got to get out of town
every now and then.

28:52.232 --> 28:54.818
- You know what I mean?
- Perfectly.

28:54.901 --> 28:59.280
I've got that all fixed now.
I've got me a lodge up in Maine.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.908
I love lodges.

29:04.160 --> 29:08.123
- You do?
- Simply adore them.

29:08.206 --> 29:11.334
You mean...

29:11.418 --> 29:13.545
you'd like to see mine?

29:13.628 --> 29:18.508
Oh, well, I was speaking
more figuratively than relatively.

29:18.591 --> 29:23.972
Because if you would,
I'm going up there Friday afternoon.

29:24.055 --> 29:26.391
Simply adore 'em!

29:34.816 --> 29:37.652
If you wanna know
what kind of a guy I've got...

29:41.030 --> 29:43.658
All I can say is
I'm a very happy woman.

29:43.741 --> 29:47.287
Not only is Mr. Hanley a perfect doll,
but he's absolutely unaffiliated.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.664
- You don't think he's a little old?
- Grow up, will you?

29:49.747 --> 29:52.125
Men with that much dough
are never a little old.

29:52.208 --> 29:55.211
Mine's loaded too,
but he's a real yawn.

29:55.295 --> 29:58.047
- He doesn't look single to me either.
- He's not.

29:58.131 --> 30:01.217
- What are you wasting time on him for?
- What else have I got?

30:01.301 --> 30:04.053
Unless you'd like me to lose him
and join you and your friend.

30:04.137 --> 30:06.848
You do, and I'll break your neck
in front of this restaurant.

30:06.931 --> 30:10.143
- Besides, he's invited me to a party.
- Oh, yeah? When?

30:10.226 --> 30:12.145
We're leaving Friday afternoon.

30:12.228 --> 30:14.814
- Leaving for where?
- His lodge in Maine.

30:14.898 --> 30:18.693
- You out of your mind?
- I don't think so. I like lodges.

30:18.776 --> 30:21.654
You can't go.
It's a violation of the whole idea.

30:21.738 --> 30:25.074
Why is it? I could meet somebody
else up there, couldn't I?

30:25.158 --> 30:27.911
Who are you going to
meet in Maine, Eskimos?

30:28.453 --> 30:30.371
Did you see this fellow I'm with?

30:30.455 --> 30:32.373
- I saw him.
- What's he look like?

30:32.457 --> 30:35.793
- Very nice for a one-eyed man.
- Is that all he's got?

30:35.877 --> 30:38.004
What do you think
he's got that patch on for?

30:38.087 --> 30:40.673
I didn't know it was a patch. I thought
somebody might have belted him.

30:40.798 --> 30:44.469
Why can't you keep those cheaters on
long enough to see who you're with?

30:44.552 --> 30:46.554
I'm not going to
take a chance like that.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.681
You know what they say
about girls who wear glasses.

30:48.765 --> 30:50.683
Maybe somebody shot him
in the eye.

30:50.767 --> 30:54.062
He sounds just wonderful. I was
curious to know what he looked like.

30:54.145 --> 30:56.189
- Who is he?
- I don't know that either.

30:56.272 --> 30:59.609
But he hasn't mentioned anything
under a million dollars yet.

30:59.692 --> 31:04.531
My guy's real class. Never mentions
his wealth, just refers to it.

31:04.614 --> 31:07.700
All Mr. Brewster talks about
is what a horrible family he's got.

31:07.784 --> 31:09.786
But I'll say this for him,
we haven't ordered anything yet

31:09.869 --> 31:11.788
under five dollars a portion.

31:11.871 --> 31:15.375
If there's anything leftover,
tell the waiter you want it for the dog.

31:15.458 --> 31:18.628
We'd better be getting back
before they cool off.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.966
Where's Maine, anyway?

32:09.596 --> 32:12.765
I'll take that and that
and that and that.

32:12.849 --> 32:14.767
And that and that.

32:14.851 --> 32:17.478
And that and that
and that and that.

32:17.562 --> 32:19.606
- And charge it.
- Certainly, Mrs. Hanley.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.752
Next stop Arabia, sir.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.404
- Is he kidding?
- Not at all.

33:08.488 --> 33:11.908
It's an old custom of the East
to make the stranger feel welcome.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.535
You can tell him from me
I think he's simply a doll,

33:14.619 --> 33:18.247
and I couldn't be crazier
about these old Eastern customs.

33:41.771 --> 33:46.526
Hello, Fashion House?
Is Mr. Antoine in for Mr. Brookman?

33:46.609 --> 33:49.195
Thank you.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.906
Mr. Antoine?

33:51.989 --> 33:53.908
On the phone.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.910
- Tony? Hiya, boy.
<i>- Yes?</i>

33:55.993 --> 33:57.912
<i>- How are you?
- Fine, fine.</i>

33:57.995 --> 34:00.790
How are you fixed for stuff for Florida,
beach stuff and all that?

34:00.873 --> 34:03.710
- You mean ultra?
- I got an aunt I want to get stuff for.

34:03.793 --> 34:06.546
- How old <i>is she?</i>
- About 25. A very young type aunt.

34:06.629 --> 34:09.549
<i>- I'm sure I could accommodate you.
- Could I see it on them?</i>

34:09.632 --> 34:12.844
- Today?
- That's right. That's the idea.

34:12.927 --> 34:15.054
Tony, you know a model
named Schatze?

34:15.138 --> 34:17.306
- Who?
- Schatze.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.976
<i>- Oh, Mrs. Page.
- That's the one.</i>

34:23.896 --> 34:27.442
- Oh, nice joint you got here, Tony.
- Thank you, sir.

34:27.525 --> 34:30.235
- Please sit here.
- If you'll excuse me.

34:30.319 --> 34:32.822
Your aunt,
is she blond or brunette?

34:32.905 --> 34:34.782
It depends entirely
on the weather.

34:34.907 --> 34:38.578
The way I'm going to handle it,
I'm not going to stall with Mr. Hanley.

34:38.661 --> 34:40.663
What are you going to do,
mother him?

34:40.746 --> 34:43.373
No, that's all right for kids,
but I don't think a mother

34:43.458 --> 34:46.585
is exactly what Mr. Hanley
has in mind.

34:46.668 --> 34:51.047
Our first we call
"Rainbow Over the Everglades."

34:52.800 --> 34:58.264
It's a pastel plaid, silk organza
day dress with a voluminous skirt

34:58.347 --> 35:01.934
for cocktail parties
and afternoon gatherings.

35:09.942 --> 35:13.362
You know, of course,
that diamonds are a girl's best friend.

35:13.446 --> 35:16.616
And this is our proof of it.

35:35.802 --> 35:38.471
You're not really thinking of going
away with that chowderhead, are you?

35:38.554 --> 35:40.598
Oh, for heaven's sake, no!

35:40.681 --> 35:43.893
- You're on, Loke.
- Oh, goodness!

35:43.976 --> 35:47.021
This one we call
"Looky, Looky, LookyP"

35:49.941 --> 35:53.069
It begins as
a spectator's sports dress.

35:53.194 --> 35:57.031
- Well, get you.
- Hi.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.617
Which converts into
a one-piece play costume

35:59.700 --> 36:02.829
of Jersey
and checked-matching wool.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.636
Our next we call
"Good Afternoon, Sweetheart."

36:18.719 --> 36:23.975
This is an afternoon tea dress, which
plunges in the back rather than the front.

36:24.058 --> 36:28.396
Made of imported printed sheer,
with parasol to match.

36:42.577 --> 36:44.829
<i>You like that, monsieur?</i>

36:44.912 --> 36:46.706
<i>Comme ci, comme ça.</i>

36:47.957 --> 36:49.959
That guy's really
the end of the line.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.003
I still think he's kinda cute.

36:52.086 --> 36:54.589
- Who is he?
- That garage man.

36:54.672 --> 36:58.175
- What garage?
- That fella I got with the cold cuts.

36:58.301 --> 37:03.389
"Trouble in the Afternoon." A beach
boy's shirt of pink and white gingham,

37:03.472 --> 37:05.516
with a deep rose crushed cummerbund.

37:05.600 --> 37:09.145
And a coolie hat of natural straw.

37:12.148 --> 37:16.444
"Hard-Hearted Hannah"
is a Palm Beach stroller

37:16.527 --> 37:19.530
consisting of
mustard crash pants

37:19.614 --> 37:23.367
and a shirttail blouse
of grey and white silk.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.874
Next we have
"Double Frozen Daiquiris."

37:29.957 --> 37:33.044
A beach costume of sleek
blue pants of fine wool,

37:33.127 --> 37:35.755
with a wrap around of Thai silk.

37:35.838 --> 37:40.051
You will notice the Egyptian influence
in the bizarre raffia hat.

37:42.845 --> 37:46.515
"South of the Border" is Mexican crepe
of black cotton twill,

37:46.599 --> 37:51.395
a tamale-colored serape
and a peon straw hat.

37:58.069 --> 38:00.613
Could I take another look
at that pink-and-blue job?

38:00.696 --> 38:02.990
But of course, sir. Miss Schatze.

38:30.559 --> 38:33.604
- Much obliged, Tony.
- Not at all, sir.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.652
Did you see anything
I could put aside for you?

38:39.735 --> 38:42.863
Nope. I don't see anything here
that I want. Thanks again, Tony.

38:42.947 --> 38:45.658
All right, girls. Thank you.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.663
- Mr. Antoine?
- Yes?

38:50.746 --> 38:52.915
- I know that guy. He's a screw pot.
- A screw pot?

38:52.999 --> 38:55.001
- He's making a chump out of you.
- Miss Schatze.

38:55.084 --> 38:57.420
- Yes?
- Do I tell you how to put on a girdle?

38:57.503 --> 38:59.422
You bet your sweet life you don't.

38:59.505 --> 39:03.259
Then, would you be good enough
not to tell me how to run my business?

40:03.736 --> 40:06.405
- Mr. Brewster?
- Yes.

40:06.489 --> 40:08.491
I'll take these.

40:13.788 --> 40:15.790
Aboard!

40:39.271 --> 40:41.440
You're not the regular
driver, are you?

40:41.524 --> 40:43.692
No, sir.
Pa's the regular driver.

40:43.776 --> 40:48.197
But he went to a Republican rally last
night and didn't get up this morning.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.658
It certainly is
a funny place for it.

40:50.741 --> 40:53.160
Funny place for what?

40:53.244 --> 40:55.371
A convention.

41:14.348 --> 41:17.476
- What's this?
- The lodge, naturally.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.687
This house?

41:31.699 --> 41:35.077
It'll look better
when I get a fire going.

41:35.161 --> 41:37.538
- But where are the others?
- Other what?

41:37.621 --> 41:39.832
- Members.
- I'm sorry, Miss Dempsey.

41:39.915 --> 41:43.711
I don't know what you're talking
about half the time. What members?

41:43.794 --> 41:46.630
- You said it was a lodge, didn't you?
- I did and it is.

41:46.714 --> 41:49.717
Then, where are the members.
Like the Elks Lodge.

41:49.800 --> 41:53.804
Mother and I went to an Elks Lodge
convention in Philadelphia,

41:53.888 --> 41:55.848
and there were thousands
of members there.

41:55.931 --> 41:57.975
It was one of the happiest
times of our life.

41:58.058 --> 42:00.394
Is that what you really
thought this was?

42:00.477 --> 42:02.188
Well, naturally. What else?

42:02.271 --> 42:04.356
- Where do you want these?
- Back in the car.

42:04.440 --> 42:06.358
What's the matter?
Something wrong?

42:06.442 --> 42:08.861
No, just going back
to New York, that's all.

42:08.944 --> 42:12.031
Well, not today, you're not.
No more trains till tomorrow.

42:12.114 --> 42:15.367
Oh, I may slit my throat.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.369
- Would you like a fire?
- I was about to...

42:17.453 --> 42:18.787
That's all right. I'll do it.

42:18.913 --> 42:20.831
Never saw so much snow
in my life.

42:20.915 --> 42:23.709
I'm sorry about all this.
If you'll just be patient,

42:23.792 --> 42:27.129
I'll try to get you out of here
as soon as I possibly can.

42:27.213 --> 42:31.050
I figured I might have to put on some
of those skis, but not in all this snow.

42:31.133 --> 42:34.887
I'll tell you what. I have
some old Medford rum in the pantry.

42:34.970 --> 42:39.225
I'll get a drink for you. And meanwhile,
maybe you'd like a little music.

42:39.308 --> 42:42.436
Meanwhile, maybe I'd like
a little poison too.

42:48.817 --> 42:51.111
You got radio
all the way up here?

42:51.195 --> 42:53.489
Oh, sure.
Radio and houses, everything.

42:53.572 --> 42:56.158
Here. Maybe you'd better
take the first one straight.

42:56.242 --> 43:01.664
Just listen to that music, all the way
from New York. Good ol' Harry James.

43:01.747 --> 43:04.208
Is it really? How can you tell?

43:04.291 --> 43:08.087
Oh, I can tell it's Harry James
because it is Harry James.

43:08.170 --> 43:11.632
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you are listening
to the music of Ziggy Colombo,</i>

43:11.715 --> 43:14.927
<i>- coming to you from the...
- Turn that liar off.</i>

43:15.010 --> 43:18.764
Why don't you stop acting like
a spoiled brat and behave yourself?

43:18.847 --> 43:21.433
I've never been mixed up
in a situation like this before.

43:21.517 --> 43:24.561
As long as I'm in my right mind,
I never will again.

43:24.645 --> 43:28.774
But it's not doing either of us any good
to stand here and jaw at each other.

43:28.857 --> 43:31.777
I feel awful. All tingly.

43:31.860 --> 43:35.239
Well, I wish I did.
Drink it. Drink it.

43:36.907 --> 43:39.159
Is this rum?

43:39.243 --> 43:41.453
Medford Rum.
It's over 100 years old.

43:41.537 --> 43:45.791
Then I'm sick. I've got a fever.
Call a doctor immediately.

43:45.874 --> 43:48.460
- What are you talking about?
- I've got a fever, I tell you.

43:48.544 --> 43:51.297
Whenever rum smells like a carnation,
I've got a fever.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.299
We've got to get
a doctor right away.

43:53.382 --> 43:55.384
- There's no reason to get hysterical.
- Don't you hit me!

43:55.467 --> 43:58.012
I'm not going to hit you.
I want to feel your forehead.

43:58.095 --> 44:00.931
- There's a thermometer outside the door.
- Get it! Get it!

44:01.015 --> 44:03.809
Will you please call a doctor?
I know when I've got a fever.

44:03.892 --> 44:05.811
You do feel a little warm.

44:05.894 --> 44:08.147
Are you going to call
a doctor or not?

44:08.230 --> 44:11.567
I can't call a doctor. Everybody knows
me here. Don't you understand?

44:11.650 --> 44:16.947
What am I supposed to do, die because
you got a big name around here?

44:17.031 --> 44:20.659
- It's a little large, but...
- Is there a hospital around here?

44:20.743 --> 44:22.703
- Open your mouth.
- What's that?

44:22.786 --> 44:25.414
- I want to take your temperature.
- Not with that flute.

44:25.497 --> 44:27.750
It's not a flute,
it's a thermometer. Look.

44:27.833 --> 44:30.252
That's not for people,
it's for blizzards.

44:30.336 --> 44:33.088
Open your mouth, I tell you.

44:33.172 --> 44:35.924
And don't you try to talk
until I take that out.

44:43.098 --> 44:45.392
If it was my daughter,
you know what I'd do?

44:45.476 --> 44:48.854
Well, she's not your daughter.
She's not my daughter either,

44:48.937 --> 44:51.315
if that's what you're driving at.

44:52.858 --> 44:55.319
- How much is it?
- One hundred and two.

44:55.402 --> 44:59.656
- Is that bad?
- It's definitely a slight temperature.

44:59.740 --> 45:02.034
Maybe you call it slight
in the city of New York,

45:02.117 --> 45:04.036
but in Maine,
she oughta be in bed.

45:04.119 --> 45:06.497
I'm gonna die. I know it.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.791
I'm gonna die out here
in this jungle!

45:08.874 --> 45:11.085
If you want, I'll call Ma.
She's a practical nurse.

45:11.168 --> 45:13.420
- Oh, what good will that do?
- We can tell her the symptoms.

45:13.504 --> 45:16.215
She'll give us the answers.

45:16.298 --> 45:19.426
All right. But be very careful
what you tell her.

45:19.510 --> 45:21.595
I'll tell her what you
tell me to tell her.

45:26.225 --> 45:28.644
Hazel? Eben.

45:28.727 --> 45:30.896
Ring Ma, will ya?

45:30.979 --> 45:33.065
Brewster's Lodge.
Yeah, he's here with...

45:33.148 --> 45:35.526
His skis.

45:35.609 --> 45:38.070
If it's mumps, I'll die.

45:38.153 --> 45:41.407
Ma? Say, what's it a sign of
when a girl is shivering and shaking

45:41.490 --> 45:44.034
and has a temperature of 102?

45:45.411 --> 45:48.747
- Her eyes watering?
- Like two faucets.

45:48.831 --> 45:50.749
They're watering.

45:50.833 --> 45:52.835
Look at her tongue.

45:53.752 --> 45:56.338
It looks kind of red.

45:56.422 --> 45:58.966
Tongue's blotchy.

45:59.049 --> 46:01.385
Look behind her ears.

46:02.803 --> 46:04.721
Have you been
scratching yourself?

46:04.805 --> 46:08.183
Of course not.
Models aren't allowed to scratch.

46:08.267 --> 46:10.436
Breaking out behind the ears.

46:21.613 --> 46:25.284
I see. Okay, thanks, Ma.

46:26.452 --> 46:28.829
- You got nothing to worry about.
- What is it?

46:28.912 --> 46:31.415
- Measles.
- Measles!

46:31.498 --> 46:33.417
And I've got nothing
to worry about.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.502
"Get her to bed," Ma says.

46:35.586 --> 46:39.465
Keep her quiet and the room dark
so you can avoid complications.

46:39.548 --> 46:41.925
She'll be as good as new
in a week or two.

46:42.009 --> 46:45.721
Oh!

47:01.445 --> 47:03.655
- Keep it.
- Much obliged.

47:13.582 --> 47:15.959
Yes, sir.

47:17.252 --> 47:19.338
- Hi, Mike.
- Well, for goodness sakes.

47:19.421 --> 47:21.673
How are you, Mr. Denmark?
I thought you were in Europe.

47:21.757 --> 47:24.801
I was. Come back here.

47:27.804 --> 47:29.723
You're a friend of mine, aren't you?

47:29.806 --> 47:31.850
- You bet your life, sir.
- Yeah, well,

47:31.934 --> 47:34.978
I'm in a little jam with the income
tax department, and I need your help.

47:35.062 --> 47:37.189
Anything you want, sir.
I've had a little trouble

47:37.272 --> 47:39.608
with those people myself
from time to time.

47:39.691 --> 47:42.236
- Who's got my apartment now?
- Three young ladies, sir.

47:42.319 --> 47:44.363
- Business women, I believe.
- Yeah, well,

47:44.446 --> 47:46.907
I gotta get in there for a few minutes.
Think you can arrange it?

47:46.990 --> 47:49.660
You can get in there now, sir.
They're both out for the evening.

47:49.743 --> 47:52.538
One of them's with a Texas fellow,
and the other's with the one-eyed man

47:52.621 --> 47:56.625
- How about the other one?
- Oh, she's away at an Elks convention.

47:59.336 --> 48:01.838
- You want me to wait here?
- Yeah, if you can.

48:01.922 --> 48:04.716
If I get a buzz, I'll come back.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.927
That's not them.
They never get in till 2:00 or 3:00.

48:07.010 --> 48:09.304
- I'll be right back.
- Okay if I turn on the lights?

48:09.388 --> 48:11.390
Sure.

49:02.232 --> 49:04.484
Pola must have left the lights on.

49:04.568 --> 49:08.030
- What will you have to drink?
- Milk, if you don't mind.

49:09.364 --> 49:12.159
Milk? Well, if we've got any.

49:12.242 --> 49:15.704
Go to the kitchen, will you?
I'll be there in a minute.

50:15.972 --> 50:18.600
Is that the best we've got?

50:18.684 --> 50:22.020
Apparently, but it's all I want.

50:22.104 --> 50:26.191
Schatze, you've made my visit
a very pleasant one.

50:26.274 --> 50:29.444
I'd like to do something
to show my appreciation.

50:29.528 --> 50:31.446
Oh, don't be silly, J.D.

50:31.530 --> 50:35.659
Tell me something. Is this furniture
really out to be cleaned,

50:35.742 --> 50:38.453
or is there
some other explanation?

50:38.537 --> 50:40.706
You don't have to
worry about that.

50:40.789 --> 50:44.418
Did you sell it or hock it?

50:44.501 --> 50:47.045
Well, we sold it.

50:47.129 --> 50:49.798
Will they sell it back?

50:56.054 --> 50:59.307
And now, dear Schatze,

50:59.391 --> 51:01.727
I'm afraid
we must say good-bye.

51:01.810 --> 51:05.397
Good-bye? But I thought
you were staying until next week.

51:05.480 --> 51:10.235
I was, but something has happened
that I would never have dreamed of.

51:10.318 --> 51:13.905
And I think the wisest thing I can do
is to get out of here at once.

51:13.989 --> 51:16.575
What do you mean?

51:16.658 --> 51:19.703
Do you remember the first time I came
into this apartment with Loco?

51:19.786 --> 51:21.246
Yes.

51:21.329 --> 51:24.332
I came in here a subtle and aging widower,

51:24.416 --> 51:27.586
with a pattern of my life all laid out
for the rest of my days.

51:27.669 --> 51:32.257
- Really?
- That isn't the way I went out of here.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.509
You didn't?

51:34.593 --> 51:37.012
Tell me, do you believe
in love at first sight?

51:37.095 --> 51:41.099
Oh, absolutely, J.D.
No question in the world about it.

51:41.183 --> 51:43.935
Well, I don't.
Not at my age, anyway.

51:44.019 --> 51:47.856
Stop talking about your age. You'd
think you were as old as Methuselah.

51:47.939 --> 51:51.359
Don't you know you're right
in the very prime of life?

51:51.443 --> 51:53.862
How old are you?

51:53.945 --> 51:56.198
Forty.

51:56.281 --> 51:59.910
Oh, Schatze, Schatze.

51:59.993 --> 52:03.413
That's probably the sweetest lie
you've ever told.

52:03.497 --> 52:05.832
Twenty-five would be
a little more like it, wouldn't it?

52:05.916 --> 52:09.127
But look here, J.D. You don't want
to go jumping to conclusions, do you?

52:09.211 --> 52:13.590
Look, it's no use, darling.
I'm 56 years old.

52:13.673 --> 52:15.967
Thirty years older than you.

52:16.051 --> 52:18.011
By your standards, anyway,
an old man.

52:18.094 --> 52:20.931
- Oh, no.
- We might support this difference

52:21.014 --> 52:24.768
for another
four to five years perhaps,

52:24.851 --> 52:27.145
but what happens
when I'm truly old?

52:27.229 --> 52:30.273
But listen, J.D.
I hate young men.

52:44.496 --> 52:48.375
- Thank you very much.
- That's all right.

52:48.458 --> 52:51.503
- Have you got to go already?
- I'm afraid so.

52:51.586 --> 52:53.922
- Well, nighty-night.
- Good night.

52:56.925 --> 52:59.761
I've always liked older men.

52:59.845 --> 53:01.888
Look at Roosevelt.
Look at Churchill.

53:01.972 --> 53:04.224
Look at that old fellow
what's-his-name in African Queen.

53:04.307 --> 53:06.309
Absolutely crazy about him.

53:06.393 --> 53:09.437
- So, you see, J.D...
- Pardon me.

53:10.230 --> 53:13.149
- Hello. Come in.
- Hope I'm not intruding.

53:13.233 --> 53:15.068
You're entitled to such
a hope, I believe.

53:15.151 --> 53:18.947
Don't let her kid you, Pola.
I've got to be going, anyway.

53:19.030 --> 53:22.450
- So early?
- Yes, I'm flying home tomorrow morning.

53:22.534 --> 53:24.703
- Oh, no.
- I've got to.

53:24.828 --> 53:28.081
Good-bye, my dear. It's been
a great pleasure knowing all you girls.

53:28.164 --> 53:30.166
Good-bye, J.D.
Come back, will you?

53:30.250 --> 53:32.544
I will. Someday, perhaps.

53:32.627 --> 53:35.171
Good-bye.

53:35.255 --> 53:37.173
What time
does your plane leave?

53:37.257 --> 53:38.884
9200.

53:39.259 --> 53:43.013
Don't you believe
anything I say at all?

53:43.096 --> 53:48.351
I believe that nothing could have been
more wonderful for me than marrying you.

53:48.435 --> 53:51.396
And nothing worse for you.

53:51.479 --> 53:55.400
- Will you call me before you go?
- That's too early for you.

53:55.650 --> 53:57.694
Very well.

53:59.696 --> 54:02.490
Good night, darling.

54:09.164 --> 54:11.416
What's the matter?

54:11.499 --> 54:14.336
I oughta punch you
right smack in the nose.

54:14.419 --> 54:16.546
- What did I do?
- Nothing.

54:16.630 --> 54:19.424
Nothing but break up a play
at the two-yard line, that's all.

54:19.507 --> 54:21.927
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Schatze.
Really I am.

54:22.010 --> 54:24.721
Little Miss Bubblehead
is terribly, terribly sorry, indeed.

54:24.804 --> 54:26.806
I was just so anxious
to tell you the news.

54:26.890 --> 54:30.393
- What news?
- We're going to be married.

54:30.477 --> 54:33.438
- You and who?
- Me and Stewart.

54:33.521 --> 54:35.440
You mean Blinky?

54:35.523 --> 54:37.943
Yes. And if he doesn't have to
fly to London this weekend,

54:38.026 --> 54:40.904
he's going to take me down
to meet his mother this Saturday.

54:40.987 --> 54:43.448
- Down where?
- Atlantic City.

54:43.531 --> 54:47.494
Oh. What did you say
this guy did?

54:47.577 --> 54:51.623
Oil, darling.
Simply barrels of it.

54:51.706 --> 54:53.792
- Says he?
- But of course.

54:53.875 --> 54:56.544
You ought to hear him
talk about it, really.

54:56.628 --> 54:59.047
I think we oughta put
a check on that one.

54:59.130 --> 55:01.299
Why? I don't know
what you mean.

55:01.383 --> 55:04.135
Nobody's mother lives
in Atlantic City on Saturday.

55:08.723 --> 55:10.642
<i>- Hello?
- Miss Page?</i>

55:10.725 --> 55:12.894
That's right, it's still no.

55:33.039 --> 55:35.083
Oh! Oh!

55:53.101 --> 55:54.894
Oh!

55:54.978 --> 55:56.896
Now who on earth
ever thought of this?

55:56.980 --> 55:59.232
- Thought of what?
- Skiing on snow.

55:59.315 --> 56:01.234
What else would you ski on?

56:01.317 --> 56:03.862
Why, the natural way,
like in Florida, on water.

56:03.945 --> 56:06.406
Ski on water? Why you.

56:06.489 --> 56:08.450
Oh, no!

56:22.714 --> 56:25.341
Mrs. Salem!

56:25.425 --> 56:27.761
Here she is now.

56:27.844 --> 56:31.264
How are you feeling?

56:31.347 --> 56:33.433
Never mind how I feel.
Where have you been?

56:33.516 --> 56:35.477
- Sitting on the mountain.
- Who with?

56:35.560 --> 56:37.479
Nobody.

56:37.562 --> 56:40.023
- What's that?
- I'm going to give you a manicure.

56:41.107 --> 56:43.234
- What was his name?
- Eben.

56:43.318 --> 56:46.905
You gotta be careful. You don't want to
get mixed up with a fellow like that.

56:46.988 --> 56:48.907
- Don't I?
- Never.

56:48.990 --> 56:50.909
Who do you think I oughta
get mixed up with?

56:50.992 --> 56:54.120
Well, I won't always
have measles, you know.

56:54.204 --> 56:56.790
Say, you are getting better.

56:56.873 --> 56:59.209
You just wait till
we get back to New York.

56:59.292 --> 57:02.128
- I don't dig you sometimes.
- What do you mean?

57:02.212 --> 57:04.339
- Is your wife a spook?
- Of course not.

57:04.422 --> 57:07.092
She's a very wonderful woman
and a true credit to her sex.

57:07.175 --> 57:10.178
- Oh, brother!
- I mean it.

57:10.261 --> 57:12.806
- Then, Why'd you flip like this?
- Pardon?

57:12.889 --> 57:14.808
What set you off that night?

57:14.891 --> 57:16.935
Oh! Well, for one thing,

57:17.018 --> 57:20.396
- you're a very beautiful young woman.
- I know.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.941
And for another,
I was a little upset that evening.

57:23.024 --> 57:25.610
My daughter had just
run away and got married.

57:25.693 --> 57:27.862
Well, for goodness sakes,
what's wrong with that?

57:27.946 --> 57:31.116
What was wrong with that
was the fella's no good. He's a gigolo.

57:31.199 --> 57:33.493
Oh, really? Maybe I know him.
What's his name?

57:33.576 --> 57:35.870
- His name's Martinez.
- I read about that.

57:35.954 --> 57:38.248
He's a dancer.
"Hoofer Weds Heiress."

57:38.331 --> 57:40.250
Well, she isn't one any more.

57:40.333 --> 57:42.377
- What do you mean?
- I disinherited her.

57:42.460 --> 57:44.379
Disinherited her?

57:44.462 --> 57:46.464
Well, there's one thing
I'll say for poor people,

57:46.548 --> 57:48.508
they don't go around
disinheriting their children.

57:48.591 --> 57:51.469
Obviously. They've got nothing
to disinherit them with.

57:51.553 --> 57:53.471
Say that again.

57:53.555 --> 57:57.517
Poor families don't have any money to
pass on from one generation to another.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.644
It doesn't make any difference.

57:59.727 --> 58:05.233
My mother, no matter how much money she
didn't have, she wouldn't disinherit me.

58:05.316 --> 58:08.111
Do you mind if we just
don't talk for a while?

58:08.194 --> 58:10.071
Not at all. I like not to talk.

58:57.952 --> 59:00.246
This is what
I wanted you to see.

59:00.330 --> 59:02.248
It's nice.

59:02.332 --> 59:05.543
It's all mine from the crest
of that second ridge to the north there,

59:05.627 --> 59:08.504
all the way around
as far as the eye can see to the west

59:08.588 --> 59:11.382
and back around that way
to just beyond old Baldy.

59:11.466 --> 59:14.385
- All yours?
- Yep.

59:14.469 --> 59:18.473
You mean all those trees
and mountains and everything?

59:18.556 --> 59:20.475
That's it.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.477
Well, for crying out loud.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.479
Isn't it beautiful?

59:24.562 --> 59:26.564
Isn't that what they call "timber"?

59:26.648 --> 59:28.566
Best in the world.

59:28.650 --> 59:31.486
Well, what do you know
about that?

59:31.569 --> 59:34.530
I think it's the most beautiful sight
in the whole world.

59:34.614 --> 59:37.283
Well, I certainly
don't blame you.

59:37.367 --> 59:40.787
Pure and as clean
and plenty of room.

59:40.870 --> 59:44.999
Do you think
you could ever come to like it?

59:45.083 --> 59:48.336
Well, I never thought
about it before,

59:48.419 --> 59:50.588
but I imagine I could.

59:50.672 --> 59:54.467
You should see it at night, with the
moon and the stars over that mountain.

59:54.550 --> 59:58.763
Look, show me again
how much is yours.

59:58.846 --> 01:00:01.641
Well, from the crest of
that second ridge to the north there,

01:00:01.724 --> 01:00:03.643
all the way around to the west.

01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:26.165
It's all right this time.
One went to work,

01:00:26.249 --> 01:00:29.460
one went to look at a bank and
the other one is still with the Elks.

01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:31.713
If I remember correctly,
that's what you said the other night.

01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:34.382
I know, but this time I'm positive.

01:01:15.006 --> 01:01:18.468
[Phone Rings 1

01:01:45.078 --> 01:01:46.704
Hello?

01:01:46.788 --> 01:01:49.207
Oh, hello.

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.751
- Hello.
- Just a moment.

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:54.003
- She's not back yet.
- She isn't?

01:01:54.087 --> 01:01:56.881
- You wanna wait?
- No thanks. I'd better be going.

01:01:56.964 --> 01:01:59.926
- I'll tell her you were here.
- Thank you.

01:02:00.009 --> 01:02:01.969
- Bye now.
- Bye.

01:02:05.181 --> 01:02:08.684
Sorry, darling. Just one of Schatze's
friends just popped in to say hello.

01:02:08.768 --> 01:02:11.521
- I'll tell you what I want you to do.
<i>- Yes?</i>

01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:14.690
It seems that I've got to nip down
to Washington this evening for dinner

01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:17.276
with a certain party
whose name I'll tell you later.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.696
But that means I'll probably
have to stay there overnight.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:24.158
<i>So, I'm going to ask you to take
the plane down to Atlantic City alone,</i>

01:02:24.242 --> 01:02:27.703
<i>and I'll be over from Washington
in time to meet you at the airport.</i>

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:30.498
<i>- Is that all right?
- Of course it is, darling.</i>

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:33.251
Then, here's a schedule
I suggest

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:37.797
There's a flight from Atlantic City
from La Guardia Airport at 5:00 P.M.

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:19.464
Fasten your seat belts, please.

01:03:19.547 --> 01:03:21.466
May I take these, please?

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.885
Well, everything's okay.

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:12.183
Well, I'll be darned.

01:04:12.266 --> 01:04:14.185
Pardon?

01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:16.187
Haven't we met before?

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:19.482
For goodness sakes, you're that friend
of Schatze's. What happened to you?

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:21.484
- When?
- Yesterday.

01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:24.195
I told Schatze you were coming back,
and she waited for you.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:26.197
I got tied up.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.324
- Your wife?
- Oh, I'm not married.

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:30.326
That's nice.

01:04:52.098 --> 01:04:55.393
- Look.
- Yes?

01:04:55.476 --> 01:04:57.520
Didn't you bring your glasses?

01:04:57.603 --> 01:05:00.147
What glasses?

01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:02.149
Don't you wear glasses?

01:05:02.233 --> 01:05:06.612
Oh, no. Whatever gives you that idea?

01:05:06.696 --> 01:05:09.532
You got the most peculiar
vision I ever saw.

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:13.160
- Why do you say that?
- You're reading that book upside down.

01:05:13.244 --> 01:05:15.162
But I'm no such thing.

01:05:15.246 --> 01:05:17.164
Not you, the book.

01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:22.420
Oh.

01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:24.422
Isn't it silly, though?

01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:26.424
What is it, astigmatism?

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:28.884
- No, just blind as a bat.
- Me too.

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:30.928
Oh, really?

01:05:31.012 --> 01:05:33.514
Then, why aren't you
wearing glasses?

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:36.851
I am wearing glasses.

01:05:41.022 --> 01:05:43.941
Well, there you are.

01:05:44.025 --> 01:05:47.486
I used to be like that. For years,
I went around banging into fireplugs

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:51.741
and shaking hands with lampposts because
I didn't want to be called four eyes.

01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:55.161
And then, something happened which
cured me of that sort of thing forever.

01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:57.246
What was that?

01:05:57.330 --> 01:06:00.875
One evening, I said hello to three
different fellows I owed money to.

01:06:03.002 --> 01:06:06.172
But it's different with girls,
don't you think?

01:06:06.255 --> 01:06:08.174
How is it?

01:06:08.257 --> 01:06:12.511
Well, you know what they say
about girls who wear glasses.

01:06:12.595 --> 01:06:14.722
What are you talking about?

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:17.642
Men aren't attentive
to girls who wear glasses.

01:06:17.725 --> 01:06:19.644
Did you ever try it?

01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:21.646
No.

01:06:21.729 --> 01:06:24.815
- You brought them with you, didn't you?
- Yes.

01:06:24.899 --> 01:06:28.152
Then, why don't you put them on?
Find out for yourself.

01:06:28.235 --> 01:06:29.654
With you?

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:31.238
Why not?

01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:35.409
Well.

01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:42.291
If you're worried about me, I'll tell
you right now before you put them on,

01:06:42.375 --> 01:06:45.044
I already think
you're quite a strudel.

01:06:45.127 --> 01:06:47.088
- Honestly?
- Absolutely.

01:06:47.171 --> 01:06:50.508
I've thought so
from the first minute I saw you.

01:06:51.384 --> 01:06:55.471
Well, if you really think so.

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:01.185
Go ahead. Put them on.

01:07:05.189 --> 01:07:08.234
- You're crazy.
- No?

01:07:08.317 --> 01:07:10.903
- You look better with them on.
- I do?

01:07:10.986 --> 01:07:14.156
Gives your face a certain mystery.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.158
No kidding.

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:19.120
And distinction.
A certain kind of distinction.

01:07:19.203 --> 01:07:21.789
Well, what do you know
about that?

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:24.583
You're already a very good-looking girl,
if you don't mind my saying so.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:26.585
- No, not at all.
- And the glasses.

01:07:26.669 --> 01:07:29.380
That particular type gives your face
a very interesting,

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:31.382
difference.

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:35.720
You don't think they make me
look like an old maid.

01:07:35.803 --> 01:07:40.474
I've never seen anybody in my whole life
who reminded me less of an old maid.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.859
What's your name?

01:07:58.284 --> 01:08:00.202
So what happened was this.

01:08:00.286 --> 01:08:02.413
I sent this check to this fellow,
this tax expert.

01:08:02.496 --> 01:08:06.625
Instead of paying the tax, he cashed the
check and put the money in his pocket.

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:08.669
But why didn't you tell that
to the government?

01:08:08.753 --> 01:08:10.671
Well, I did, but you know
how the government is.

01:08:10.755 --> 01:08:13.257
Couldn't be more sympathetic,
but they still wanted the dough.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.926
Even after you told them
that fellow was a crook?

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:20.014
What did that mean? As far as they
were concerned, the only crook was me.

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.892
I had to have some proof. That's why
I had to get back and get this check.

01:08:22.975 --> 01:08:25.227
Well, how do you like that?

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:28.104
When I found out he'd gone
to Kansas City, I jumped on a plane.

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:31.442
He's either going to kick in with the
money, or I'm going to break his neck.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.486
Is that where he is, Kansas City?

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:36.404
So I understand.

01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:38.948
Why are you going
to Atlantic City?

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:43.203
Who's going to Atlantic City?

01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:46.582
Doesn't this plane
go to Atlantic City?

01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:50.544
What are you talking about?
This is the Midland Sky Chief.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.712
- Are you kidding?
- Of course not.

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:55.633
We should be in Kansas City
in about 20 minutes.

01:08:55.716 --> 01:08:57.718
Why?

01:08:58.844 --> 01:09:00.970
Oh, nothing.

01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:03.974
Just one of those things.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.562
Go on. Tell me some more.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:10.606
Tell me anything.

01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:43.221
Does your family
live there with you?

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:44.515
Oh, no, they couldn't do that.

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.685
I see. You mean they have
a place of their own.

01:09:47.768 --> 01:09:49.979
Oh, sure, over at Dexter Mills.

01:09:50.062 --> 01:09:52.356
I saw a picture
in Harper's Bazaar once,

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:54.400
what they call
a mountain shack.

01:09:54.483 --> 01:09:56.443
It was creamy.

01:10:03.784 --> 01:10:06.120
Well, here we are.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:09.874
- Here we are where?
- The shack. This is it.

01:10:09.957 --> 01:10:12.126
Well, what do you mean?
This is a shack.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:14.128
Well, of course.
What did I tell you?

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:16.130
It's very comfortable inside.
Come on.

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:19.425
Just a minute.
Is this really on the level?

01:10:19.508 --> 01:10:23.512
- Is what on the level?
- Well, is this really your home?

01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:27.099
Well, it is when I'm on duty.
What did you expect?

01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:29.560
Well, certainly not this.

01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:32.563
I don't know what you mean, honey.
It's just a forestry lookout station.

01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:34.732
But they're all pretty much alike.

01:10:34.815 --> 01:10:37.610
But if you're so rich, why couldn't
you build yourself a bigger one?

01:10:37.693 --> 01:10:41.238
- Like in Harper's Bazaar.
- Rich? Who's rich?

01:10:43.032 --> 01:10:45.576
- Aren't you?
- Well, that's a good one.

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:48.579
Where on earth
did you get that idea?

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:51.749
But all these trees.
Didn't you say they were yours?

01:10:51.832 --> 01:10:54.293
Well, mine to watch, sure.
That's part of my job.

01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:56.921
I don't even own a bush.

01:10:57.004 --> 01:11:00.382
Oh. But I thought...

01:11:00.466 --> 01:11:02.760
Oh, darling, this is the worst.

01:11:02.843 --> 01:11:05.554
What's the matter, sweetheart?
I don't get it.

01:11:05.638 --> 01:11:08.933
I'm so crazy about you.

01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:12.811
Well, that's wonderful.
I'm crazy about you too.

01:11:12.895 --> 01:11:16.357
But I... Oh, honey.

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.235
Oh, I see.

01:11:20.319 --> 01:11:22.988
What you mean is you're not interested
in a man without trees.

01:11:23.072 --> 01:11:25.616
That's not it at all.

01:11:25.699 --> 01:11:28.619
I'm crazy about you, but I...

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:31.372
Let's not talk about it.
Do you mind?

01:11:31.455 --> 01:11:33.415
If only you'd told me.

01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:35.918
I told you. I told you
the first day we went skiing.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:38.796
I told you then
that's what I was, a ranger.

01:11:40.089 --> 01:11:42.007
Is that what you meant?

01:11:42.091 --> 01:11:44.635
What else could I have meant?

01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:49.223
I'm sorry. I just thought
you meant you came from Texas.

01:12:12.037 --> 01:12:13.956
What's the matter
with your dad this time?

01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:16.000
He went to another
Republican rally.

01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:18.002
Maybe he'd better
join the Democrats.

01:12:18.085 --> 01:12:20.087
Not in Maine. Too lonely.

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:40.190
Can we rent a car in Portland?

01:12:40.274 --> 01:12:42.359
I suppose so.

01:12:42.443 --> 01:12:45.029
You mean we're going to
drive back to New York?

01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:47.990
It'll probably be pretty expensive,
but I think it's the safest way

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:50.117
not to be seen by anybody.

01:13:00.794 --> 01:13:03.130
When you got the measles,
I wouldn't have given ten cents

01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:06.425
for my chances of getting
out of this jam without being caught.

01:13:06.508 --> 01:13:08.427
- You know what I did?
- What?

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:12.473
I got on long distance with a few
friends around Chicago and St. Louis.

01:13:12.556 --> 01:13:16.060
I had them keep sending telegrams
to my wife, signed with my name.

01:13:16.143 --> 01:13:19.313
All about this unexpected
business trip I was on.

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:21.356
It worked like a charm.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.317
That sounds very intelligent.

01:13:30.282 --> 01:13:33.535
I don't like to boast, but if I hadn't
had that little stroke of brilliance,

01:13:33.619 --> 01:13:36.246
there could have been a lot
of very serious results in my home.

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:38.248
And business too.

01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:40.417
What are you going to do
to show you're grateful?

01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:43.087
- What do you mean?
- Whenever a person pulls a rock

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:45.089
and skins out of it,
they oughta do something nice

01:13:45.172 --> 01:13:46.423
for the injured party,
don't you think?

01:13:46.507 --> 01:13:48.425
- For instance?
- Well, for one thing,

01:13:48.509 --> 01:13:50.928
you ought to drop into Cartier's
tomorrow morning and get your wife

01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:53.305
some sort of little bubble
for her wrist.

01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:55.307
How about some nice flowers?

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:58.393
Is that all the grateful you are,
five dollars worth of geraniums?

01:13:58.477 --> 01:14:01.438
Look, if I gave Mrs. Brewster
a piece of jewelry not on her birthday,

01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:05.734
she'd have 25 private detectives
on my tail within 10 minutes.

01:14:05.818 --> 01:14:09.238
Well, if you'll pardon my frankness,
I'd be ashamed to admit it.

01:14:09.321 --> 01:14:13.283
- I'll send her a nice box of roses.
- She'll love that.

01:14:13.367 --> 01:14:15.285
She's not used to
expensive gifts.

01:14:15.369 --> 01:14:18.455
Anything more than flowers
would upset her terribly.

01:14:18.539 --> 01:14:22.084
All right, then. How about doing
something nice for your daughter?

01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:24.294
- What?
- Why don't you inherit her again?

01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:26.463
I'm sorry, that's quite
out of the question.

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:28.715
But that wouldn't cost you
anything until you were dead.

01:14:28.799 --> 01:14:31.301
I'd rather not discuss it
if you don't mind.

01:14:31.385 --> 01:14:34.138
What's the matter with you, anyway?
Everybody loves their children.

01:14:34.221 --> 01:14:37.808
Even monkeys. It's a well-known law
of Mother Nature.

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:40.978
Mother Nature never
had to deal with a gigolo.

01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:43.814
And what else pray
were you trying to be?

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:47.818
The differences between the two
should be quite obvious, even to you.

01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:50.487
And would you be so kindly
as to specify how?

01:14:50.571 --> 01:14:55.075
If you don't mind, I don't think
I care to debate the question with you.

01:14:55.159 --> 01:14:59.746
Once you get one foot on the ground,
you're really quite a jerk, aren't you?

01:15:07.421 --> 01:15:09.339
Where are we now?

01:15:09.423 --> 01:15:11.341
We'll be crossing
the George Washington Bridge...

01:15:11.425 --> 01:15:14.511
George Washington Bridge?
What are we doing way over there?

01:15:14.595 --> 01:15:18.182
On the customary routes,
I could be recognized a dozen times.

01:15:18.265 --> 01:15:20.350
This side of the river
no one knows me.

01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:24.980
It's just another example of the use
of intelligence in a situation like this.

01:15:58.096 --> 01:16:00.557
If you've got intelligence,
you don't need luck.

01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:04.645
If you've got that good old American
know-how, you don't need anything else.

01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:08.232
Because the simple truth is
that when the chips are really down,

01:16:08.315 --> 01:16:10.817
man is still the master
of his own fate.

01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:14.279
The captain of his destiny.

01:16:14.363 --> 01:16:16.573
- What is it?
- Motorcycle cops.

01:16:21.495 --> 01:16:24.248
Are you sure
you're not on the lam?

01:16:32.714 --> 01:16:34.633
It's all right.
Just keep moving.

01:16:34.716 --> 01:16:36.927
I'm awfully sorry
if I'm going too fast.

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:38.929
You're all right.
Just follow me.

01:17:00.075 --> 01:17:03.287
Good afternoon, sir.
This is George Washington Bridge Week.

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:06.456
And the city of New York extends
its heartiest congratulations

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:11.128
to the happy couple driving the 50
millionth car across our noble edifice.

01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:13.130
- Hold it. This way, lady.
- Another smile, lady.

01:17:13.213 --> 01:17:15.173
Hold it. Hold it.

01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:29.146
I'm sorry I can't give you
any more, Mrs. Page, but...

01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:31.398
you know what the market
is these days.

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:34.401
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you again, Mrs. Page.

01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:38.655
[Phone Rings 1

01:17:41.575 --> 01:17:43.994
<i>- Hello?
- Miss Page?</i>

01:17:44.077 --> 01:17:47.914
Oh, it's you again.

01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:55.630
- Are you good for seconds?
- Oh, sure.

01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:58.008
- Let's order them now.
- Two more, Mac. Well-done.

01:17:58.091 --> 01:18:01.428
And slap a little chili on that one.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.722
- You know what the trouble with you is?
- Which one?

01:18:03.805 --> 01:18:07.017
Trouble with you is you're a hamburger
with onions dame and won't admit it.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.519
I wonder how long it took you
to work that one out.

01:18:09.603 --> 01:18:12.647
My guess is that I know you
better than you know yourself.

01:18:12.731 --> 01:18:14.691
Ketchup.

01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:18.320
Coleslaw?

01:18:18.403 --> 01:18:20.322
If I can get it on here.

01:18:20.405 --> 01:18:23.617
I just don't believe that you're the
kind of girl you pretend to be at all.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.328
I'll say this for you, that's
quite a line you've got there.

01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:28.413
Here. Pickles?

01:18:28.497 --> 01:18:30.499
Thanks.

01:18:30.582 --> 01:18:34.544
It's all an act. You know as well
as I do that money isn't everything.

01:18:34.628 --> 01:18:36.546
Who told you it wasn't?

01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:38.548
Nobody had to.

01:18:38.632 --> 01:18:41.176
Did you ever have any?

01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:43.178
A little, yes.

01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:45.680
Then, how do you know
it isn't everything?

01:18:45.764 --> 01:18:49.309
Do you seriously believe having money
automatically brings you happiness?

01:18:49.393 --> 01:18:51.853
Well, no, but it doesn't
automatically depress me either.

01:18:51.937 --> 01:18:53.897
I don't believe you, Schatze.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:56.775
Look, Tommy, I'm in a jam here
Don't you understand?

01:18:56.858 --> 01:18:59.027
I'm in a very bad
financial situation.

01:18:59.111 --> 01:19:01.029
If those kids don't come back,

01:19:01.113 --> 01:19:03.240
I'm on the hook for a year's
rent for that apartment.

01:19:03.323 --> 01:19:05.242
So, what do you think
I should do now,

01:19:05.325 --> 01:19:07.828
fall in love with a character
who doesn't even own a necktie?

01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:10.914
- Haven't they written to you?
- How can they? They're illiterate.

01:19:10.997 --> 01:19:13.583
- Listen, honey...
- It's no use, Tommy boy.

01:19:13.667 --> 01:19:17.421
Just as soon as I finish this horse
burger, I never want to see you again.

01:19:21.716 --> 01:19:23.635
Hello?

01:19:23.718 --> 01:19:25.720
<i>How about taking a look
at Miss Liberty today?</i>

01:19:25.804 --> 01:19:27.722
Well.

01:19:34.104 --> 01:19:36.773
If you were solvent, it would be
an entirely different matter.

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:40.277
But I had it with a grease monkey
like you, and that's all I want of that.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.739
Okay, Miss Cafe Society, take a look out
there and give me a rest for a moment.

01:19:44.823 --> 01:19:47.784
And the truth of the matter,
I don't care what you say,

01:19:47.868 --> 01:19:50.287
is that if you're not loaded,
you've already got two strikes on you.

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:53.915
I already said okay. What else
do you want me to say about it?

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:58.003
As soon as we get off this barge,
I never want to see you again.

01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:03.717
[Phone Rings 1

01:20:06.386 --> 01:20:08.680
<i>- Yes?
- Tonight?</i>

01:20:08.763 --> 01:20:10.265
No.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.730
I mean it I tell you.

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:19.566
Just as soon as we get home,
I never want to see...

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.370
I'm sorry we can't give you
any more, Mrs. Page.

01:20:32.454 --> 01:20:33.914
I already laughed at that one.

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:36.082
Well, anyway, thanks again.

01:20:46.176 --> 01:20:48.094
May I come in?

01:20:51.014 --> 01:20:52.933
May I change my mind?

01:20:53.016 --> 01:20:54.559
Is this on the level?

01:20:54.643 --> 01:20:56.603
From the bottom of my heart.

01:20:57.103 --> 01:20:59.481
Then, hold it
for just one second.

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.904
Fred? Fred? This is Mrs. Page.

01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:09.157
Grab that furniture man and tell him
to bring that stuff right back up here.

01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:11.159
Do you understand?

01:21:12.327 --> 01:21:14.287
Don't even move.

01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:37.435
Well?

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.440
Yes.

01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:04.546
Is something wrong, Mrs. Page?

01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:07.007
I don't know.
I just feel so lonely.

01:22:07.132 --> 01:22:09.593
- Your friends?
- Yeah.

01:22:09.676 --> 01:22:12.220
Not one of those two dingbats
to stand up with me.

01:22:12.304 --> 01:22:14.514
Well, there's still a good hope
they may come yet.

01:22:14.598 --> 01:22:16.725
If they come now,
I'll throw them out on their necks.

01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:18.727
- But I thought...
- I wanted them yesterday.

01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:20.854
What time have I got
to laugh at them now?

01:22:22.689 --> 01:22:24.691
Well, for crying out loud, a party.

01:22:24.774 --> 01:22:26.693
Wait a minute.

01:22:28.069 --> 01:22:31.990
- There's Loco!
- Well, hi!

01:22:32.073 --> 01:22:34.701
- What is it?
- Schatze's wedding. Didn't you know?

01:22:34.784 --> 01:22:37.579
- Who to?
- Dallas, Texas.

01:22:39.914 --> 01:22:43.793
- Pardon me, but my name is Ding Dong.
- How do you do?

01:22:43.918 --> 01:22:46.254
- Did you have much trouble?
- What do you mean, trouble?

01:22:46.338 --> 01:22:48.465
He's absolutely insane
about me.

01:22:48.548 --> 01:22:51.092
- No kidding.
- Out of his mind.

01:22:51.176 --> 01:22:53.136
- Do you know how much he's worth?
- How much?

01:22:53.219 --> 01:22:55.138
- Thirty mil.
- He's not.

01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:57.140
Give or take a mil.

01:22:57.223 --> 01:22:59.643
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

01:22:59.726 --> 01:23:02.437
Oh, and he's a doll.
A perfect doll.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.232
- What a break.
- I'm not kidding. It's a dream marriage.

01:23:06.316 --> 01:23:08.777
What about you?
Where have you been all this time?

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:11.154
Oh, I went back to Maine.

01:23:11.237 --> 01:23:13.365
What do you mean,
you went back to Maine?

01:23:13.448 --> 01:23:17.661
Well, to tell you the truth,
I got married up there.

01:23:17.744 --> 01:23:19.663
Not to that Shriner.

01:23:19.746 --> 01:23:21.998
- Oh, no, he was already married.
- That's what I thought.

01:23:22.082 --> 01:23:24.000
Who'd you marry?

01:23:24.084 --> 01:23:27.837
Well, he's not anybody
in particular.

01:23:27.921 --> 01:23:30.674
Just a fella I met up there.

01:23:30.757 --> 01:23:33.843
But I'm absolutely
crazy about him.

01:23:33.927 --> 01:23:38.515
How do you like that?
Both of us at the same time.

01:23:38.598 --> 01:23:40.517
What does he do?

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.019
- He's a ranger.
- Cattle, you mean?

01:23:43.103 --> 01:23:46.481
No, he's a forest ranger.

01:23:46.564 --> 01:23:50.360
Well, that's not bad. If you get enough
trees, they're really worth something.

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:53.530
- How'd you meet him?
- I don't mean he owns them,

01:23:53.613 --> 01:23:55.865
he just watches them.

01:23:55.949 --> 01:23:58.743
You mean, just looks at them?

01:23:58.827 --> 01:24:02.789
He's got a house on top of a mountain.
They keep a lookout for fires

01:24:02.872 --> 01:24:04.874
so all those trees
don't burn down.

01:24:04.958 --> 01:24:07.502
How can he make any dough
out of that?

01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:09.629
He doesn't, much.

01:24:09.713 --> 01:24:11.715
You mean
he's a kind of fireman?

01:24:11.798 --> 01:24:13.591
That's it.

01:24:21.433 --> 01:24:23.560
- Thank you.
- Mr. Hanley?

01:24:23.643 --> 01:24:26.938
- You have the license, I suppose.
- Yes, right here.

01:24:32.569 --> 01:24:34.612
Wouldn't you like to meet him?

01:24:34.696 --> 01:24:36.614
Oh, sure. Is he here?

01:24:36.698 --> 01:24:39.409
I'll get him.

01:24:49.002 --> 01:24:51.129
Hiya, Schatze.

01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:53.590
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

01:24:53.673 --> 01:24:57.969
Congratulations, honey. We read about it
on the plane. I think it's just creamy.

01:24:58.052 --> 01:24:59.971
You know how much he's got?

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:02.474
- How much?
- Fifty mil.

01:25:02.557 --> 01:25:04.476
- Brother!
- Give or take a mil.

01:25:04.559 --> 01:25:06.478
Have you been shopping yet?

01:25:06.561 --> 01:25:10.064
When they open the doors,
I fall in.

01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:12.984
- What a break!
- Where have you been?

01:25:13.067 --> 01:25:15.445
- Kansas City.
- For what?

01:25:15.528 --> 01:25:17.447
That's where Freddie and I
got married.

01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:20.283
- You mean you married that crowbar?
- Well, yes.

01:25:20.366 --> 01:25:22.535
Honest to goodness, Pola,
you need a governess.

01:25:22.619 --> 01:25:25.622
I could have pegged that guy as a phony
when I was eight years old.

01:25:25.705 --> 01:25:28.374
Oh, not Stewart.
I married Freddie.

01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:30.460
Freddie? Who he?

01:25:30.543 --> 01:25:35.465
Well, it's a little mixed up. You see,
I got on his plane to Kansas City.

01:25:35.548 --> 01:25:37.509
I thought you were going
to Atlantic City.

01:25:37.592 --> 01:25:40.386
I was, but the first stop
for this plane was Kansas City.

01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:42.806
Never mind. I don't want to
hear any more about it.

01:25:42.889 --> 01:25:45.683
Just tell me one thing...
is he holding or not?

01:25:45.809 --> 01:25:47.727
Well, yes and no.

01:25:47.811 --> 01:25:50.188
Oh, no, no, no. Not you too.

01:25:50.271 --> 01:25:53.608
I mean, he'd be holding
if he could get his hands on it.

01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:56.486
- Say that again.
- Well, he's on the lam.

01:25:56.569 --> 01:25:59.656
- A thief?
- No, no, he's not a thief.

01:25:59.739 --> 01:26:02.283
As a matter of fact,
he owns this apartment.

01:26:02.367 --> 01:26:04.661
But he gave this guy a check
for his income tax...

01:26:04.744 --> 01:26:06.663
Then, what's he on the lam for?

01:26:06.746 --> 01:26:10.208
Then, he went up to break this
guy's neck, but his glasses fell off.

01:26:10.291 --> 01:26:12.460
- Whose glasses?
- Freddie's.

01:26:12.544 --> 01:26:14.462
And the guy nearly
broke his neck.

01:26:14.546 --> 01:26:17.006
You mean, he's blind too?

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:19.175
Blinder than me.

01:26:21.553 --> 01:26:25.348
Here he is.
This is Schatze, darling.

01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.350
Oh, congratulations, Mrs. Page.

01:26:27.433 --> 01:26:29.853
Thank you. Congratulations to you too.
She's okay.

01:26:29.936 --> 01:26:32.522
- I think so.
- And this is Pola.

01:26:32.605 --> 01:26:35.233
- Glad to meet you.
- Holy Toledo!

01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:37.777
- Isn't he cute?
- Just a minute.

01:26:40.655 --> 01:26:43.867
Two more pounds
and she could be arrested for bigamy.

01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:47.829
Pardon me, Mrs. Page. Mr. Hanley would
like to know if there's a maid of honor.

01:26:47.912 --> 01:26:50.665
- If he can find one.
- Can I be it?

01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:53.334
Matron, I believe, is about
the best you can hope for.

01:26:53.418 --> 01:26:55.336
- Shall I tell him?
- Take him.

01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.881
- Come on, before Pola gets here.
- Bye.

01:26:57.964 --> 01:26:59.883
Bye.

01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:04.429
It's just Schatze. Come on.

01:27:05.555 --> 01:27:07.974
- Here he is.
- Hi, Mrs. Page.

01:27:08.057 --> 01:27:11.102
- Is that going to be permanent?
- No, it's just a brace.

01:27:11.185 --> 01:27:13.313
He takes it off at night.

01:27:13.396 --> 01:27:15.565
Don't you worry.
I'm going to get even with him yet.

01:27:15.648 --> 01:27:17.859
I just have to lay
a little low for a while.

01:27:17.942 --> 01:27:20.445
We're going underground
right after the ceremony.

01:27:20.528 --> 01:27:23.448
- You don't mind?
- Love it

01:27:23.531 --> 01:27:26.367
Well, congratulations
to you too.

01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:30.413
I think we'd better get started. Some
of the kids are beginning to foam over.

01:27:34.918 --> 01:27:39.380
Okay, tell them to blow the whistle.

01:27:44.761 --> 01:27:46.679
You're still sure?

01:27:48.222 --> 01:27:49.432
Of course.

01:28:19.921 --> 01:28:24.092
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here..."

01:28:24.175 --> 01:28:27.136
- Please.
- What's the matter, dear?

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:30.640
My ankle. Can you take me back?

01:28:30.723 --> 01:28:32.934
Why, yes. Of course.

01:28:42.694 --> 01:28:45.279
You're just too nice a guy
to get married to someone

01:28:45.363 --> 01:28:48.282
that doesn't love you all out.

01:28:48.366 --> 01:28:50.284
Was that what it was?

01:28:51.911 --> 01:28:54.580
What else?

01:28:54.664 --> 01:28:56.582
I can think of
a number of reasons

01:28:56.666 --> 01:28:59.669
why you should never have
considered me in the first place.

01:28:59.752 --> 01:29:01.879
Have I hurt you very bad?

01:29:03.214 --> 01:29:05.425
You have.

01:29:05.508 --> 01:29:07.677
But I'll recover.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.846
You sound as though
as you already have.

01:29:09.929 --> 01:29:15.018
No. No, that's just one of
the few advantages of age

01:29:15.101 --> 01:29:18.271
Disappointments become
a normal part of life.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.192
But what do you think
I should tell the guests?

01:29:23.276 --> 01:29:26.863
Oh, just tell them Mrs. Page
has blown her stack at last.

01:29:26.946 --> 01:29:29.198
No one will give you
an argument on it.

01:29:29.282 --> 01:29:31.868
Wouldn't you like to talk it over
first with Loke and Pola?

01:29:31.951 --> 01:29:35.288
- Those bubbleheads.
- Why do you say that?

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:38.207
Did you see what those
two goofballs turned up with?

01:29:38.291 --> 01:29:40.376
Yeah, I saw
Loke's forest ranger.

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.378
A fireman for trees.

01:29:42.462 --> 01:29:44.380
Seemed like a very nice boy.

01:29:44.464 --> 01:29:46.674
- Did you see what Pola brought back?
- No.

01:29:46.758 --> 01:29:49.594
- A fugitive from justice.
- No.

01:29:49.677 --> 01:29:51.637
And a blind one at that.

01:29:55.183 --> 01:29:57.018
Young man?

01:29:57.101 --> 01:30:00.646
As far as I could tell,
in back of that Halloween getup.

01:30:03.316 --> 01:30:06.736
Well, they love them,
don't they?

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:08.988
Drooling, all four of them.

01:30:11.157 --> 01:30:13.743
And who is your young man?

01:30:13.826 --> 01:30:17.205
- What young man?
- The one you're in love with.

01:30:17.288 --> 01:30:19.457
Who said I was in love
with a young man?

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.334
I did.

01:30:21.459 --> 01:30:24.087
Well,

01:30:24.170 --> 01:30:27.757
it's a sin and a shame,
but I guess I've got to admit it.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.926
I am.

01:30:30.009 --> 01:30:32.970
- Who is he?
- What does that matter?

01:30:33.054 --> 01:30:38.101
Well, I don't think it's unnatural
that I should have some curiosity.

01:30:38.184 --> 01:30:41.479
He's nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

01:30:41.562 --> 01:30:44.607
A character straight
from Characterville.

01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:47.985
- Is that his name?
- Brookman.

01:30:48.069 --> 01:30:51.697
- Brookman what?
- Tom Brookman.

01:30:51.781 --> 01:30:53.950
You say he's non-holding?

01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:56.786
One more hamburger
would break him.

01:30:56.869 --> 01:30:58.621
What does he do?

01:30:58.746 --> 01:31:02.291
He won't say, but that's nothing to me.
I already know.

01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:05.086
- What?
- He's a gas pump jockey.

01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:08.214
How do you know?

01:31:08.297 --> 01:31:10.842
How do I know how I know?

01:31:10.925 --> 01:31:14.846
There's something about those guys
that I can spot every time I see them.

01:31:14.929 --> 01:31:17.765
I married one once, remember?

01:31:17.849 --> 01:31:19.892
Does he really love you?

01:31:19.976 --> 01:31:22.520
To hear him tell it, he does.

01:31:22.603 --> 01:31:25.356
Well, what's to stop you
from marrying him?

01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:29.861
Nothing now, but it's scarcely
what you'd call progress.

01:31:31.154 --> 01:31:33.823
- He's here now, you know.
- Where?

01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:36.242
- Out there.
- How do you know?

01:31:36.325 --> 01:31:39.912
Well, there's a character out there
who looks like a gas pump jockey to me.

01:31:39.996 --> 01:31:42.915
- Has he got on a tie?
- No, no tie.

01:31:42.999 --> 01:31:47.420
And at a formal ceremony.
You see what I mean?

01:31:50.339 --> 01:31:52.425
Well, you can certainly
say that again.

01:31:52.508 --> 01:31:55.595
And after I told him
I never wanted to see him again, ever.

01:31:55.678 --> 01:31:59.682
Who does he think he is, anyway?
Crashing my wedding.

01:31:59.765 --> 01:32:03.019
Well, suppose I ask him?

01:32:03.102 --> 01:32:05.813
Now just a minute, J.D.

01:32:16.741 --> 01:32:18.659
Hiya, Tom.

01:32:18.743 --> 01:32:22.705
Okay, I guess. Congratulations.

01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:25.875
- Congratulations to you.
- Don't be funny.

01:32:25.958 --> 01:32:27.919
- Still the character?
- Well, why not?

01:32:28.002 --> 01:32:30.504
All she talks about is dough,
dough, dough. Nothing but dough.

01:32:30.588 --> 01:32:34.383
So, if that's all she wants, you can
have her. I don't want any part of her.

01:32:34.467 --> 01:32:38.387
That's the way she talks, of course,
but that's not the way she feels.

01:32:38.471 --> 01:32:41.724
I'll bet. What happened?

01:32:41.807 --> 01:32:45.561
It was a delayed decision
in your favor.

01:32:45.645 --> 01:32:48.314
- Are you kidding?
- Not in the least.

01:32:48.397 --> 01:32:51.234
- Did you tell her about me?
- Of course not.

01:32:51.317 --> 01:32:54.528
So far as she knows,
you're still hustling a gas pump.

01:32:54.612 --> 01:32:56.739
I don't believe this.

01:32:56.822 --> 01:32:59.325
- All right. Let's go ask her.
- Wait a minute.

01:33:01.202 --> 01:33:04.247
Wait a minute, J.D.
You think I ought to tell her now?

01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:06.249
Are you crazy?

01:33:06.332 --> 01:33:09.669
She obviously likes gas pump jockeys
better than millionaires.

01:33:09.752 --> 01:33:12.672
What do you want to do,
disillusion the girl?

01:33:13.673 --> 01:33:15.633
Mr. Brookman, darling.

01:33:19.303 --> 01:33:21.222
- Well, you've got a crust.
- Just a minute.

01:33:21.305 --> 01:33:24.100
- A big wedding and you with no necktie.
- Listen to me.

01:33:24.183 --> 01:33:26.978
Everybody else here dressed up in
striped pants and you show up like a...

01:33:27.061 --> 01:33:31.565
- Listen, Schatze!
- I never want to see you again.

01:33:33.526 --> 01:33:36.821
Hey, hey, hey, what about
a cheese dog burger this time?

01:33:42.201 --> 01:33:45.621
Following the ceremony, the party
adjourned to a fashionable greasy spoon,

01:33:45.705 --> 01:33:48.666
where perfectly delicious
dog burgers were served.

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:51.669
What happened with those zillionaires
everybody was talking about?

01:33:51.752 --> 01:33:53.671
Oh, what always happens
to rich zillionaires.

01:33:53.754 --> 01:33:57.550
I've got nothing to worry about.
What did you tell me you were worth?

01:33:57.633 --> 01:33:59.885
Oh, I should say
in the neighborhood of 14 dollars,

01:33:59.969 --> 01:34:02.263
- give or take a nickel.
- That's all cash too.

01:34:02.346 --> 01:34:04.307
How about you, Killer?
How are you fixed?

01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:06.976
To tell you the truth,
if I can get my hands on it...

01:34:07.059 --> 01:34:09.145
You're fixed but good.
I can tell.

01:34:09.228 --> 01:34:11.647
Wait a minute. I want to hear
from Mr. Fill 'Er Up.

01:34:11.731 --> 01:34:14.400
Just what you estimate
your fortune at?

01:34:14.483 --> 01:34:16.652
Oh, about 200 million,
I should imagine.

01:34:16.736 --> 01:34:20.323
Oh, that's not enough.
Might that all be in cash?

01:34:20.406 --> 01:34:23.034
I could probably dig up
a couple million cash if I had to.

01:34:23.117 --> 01:34:27.830
Oh, that's wonderful.
What might the rest be in, oil?

01:34:27.913 --> 01:34:30.833
Some oil.

01:34:30.916 --> 01:34:33.002
- Some airline stock.
- Good.

01:34:33.085 --> 01:34:36.505
A little steel.
Some cattle down in Texas.

01:34:36.589 --> 01:34:40.092
Couple of coal mines in Alabama.
Bit of real estate here and there.

01:34:40.176 --> 01:34:43.346
Some automobile stocks.
The Brookman Building.

01:34:43.429 --> 01:34:45.348
And, of course,
Brookman, Pennsylvania.

01:34:45.431 --> 01:34:50.353
A whole city he owns yet. Wouldn't
you know that would happen to me?

01:34:50.436 --> 01:34:52.355
Give me the check, Mac.

01:35:02.365 --> 01:35:04.950
Keep the change, Mac.

01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:15.961
Gentlemen,

01:35:16.045 --> 01:35:18.172
to our wives.

01:35:42.571 --> 01:35:43.572
English - US - SDH
