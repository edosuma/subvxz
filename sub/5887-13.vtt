01:21.967 --> 01:24.268
I need your license
and registration

01:24.303 --> 01:26.470
and I need to know
what you were doing.

01:26.472 --> 01:27.805
I'm driving.

01:27.857 --> 01:29.773
Don't get smart with me.

01:29.809 --> 01:31.809
We've been looking for you.

01:33.312 --> 01:35.195
There's been a mistake.

01:36.615 --> 01:38.982
You knew we'd catch up
with you eventually.

01:57.753 --> 01:59.219
I can't find any baking soda.

01:59.255 --> 02:01.004
We're gonna have
to make do with Colgate.

02:01.056 --> 02:03.223
On my arm?

02:05.010 --> 02:06.677
Well, you're back early.

02:06.679 --> 02:08.846
Well, we had to skip lunch.

02:08.898 --> 02:11.348
- Hello, Sherry.
- Hello.

02:11.350 --> 02:13.016
I got stinged.

02:13.068 --> 02:15.686
Oh, sweetheart.

02:15.688 --> 02:18.906
We were up at Lyman Orchards.
It's mostly bees.

02:18.941 --> 02:21.525
Daddy put toothpaste on it.

02:21.577 --> 02:23.193
Yes, and you're
no worse for wear.

02:23.245 --> 02:24.578
Not allergic, thankfully.

02:24.613 --> 02:26.497
I'm terribly so.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.000
I have an hour. I suppose
we could still grab lunch.

02:30.035 --> 02:32.336
No, this is fine.
She should probably rest.

02:32.371 --> 02:34.505
I'll see you Thursday,
Wonder Woman.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.874
We'll go to Friendly's.

02:41.297 --> 02:43.680
Well, I'm off.

02:47.853 --> 02:49.853
Go inside and lay down,
sweetheart.

02:52.691 --> 02:54.141
Every time Bill has the kids,

02:54.193 --> 02:55.642
something terrible happens.

02:57.279 --> 03:00.063
The incredible thing is
I make her lunch,

03:00.065 --> 03:02.733
I take her to school,
I read to her every night,

03:02.735 --> 03:04.902
and he spends Sunday
and Thursday night with her

03:04.954 --> 03:06.403
and that's all I hear about.

03:06.455 --> 03:08.071
Well, I admire you.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.458
Are you trying to get me
to make you lunch?

03:11.493 --> 03:15.329
No, I think it's admirable that you
haven't poisoned her against him.

03:15.381 --> 03:17.881
I don't know if I could
have that restraint.

03:17.917 --> 03:19.583
Yes, you would.

03:19.585 --> 03:21.501
Because you'd be concerned
about your child

03:21.554 --> 03:23.670
and do your best
to forget things.

03:23.722 --> 03:27.591
And not expect your friends
to remind you all the time.

03:28.644 --> 03:30.177
I am so sorry.

03:30.229 --> 03:32.429
That is not what
I was trying to say.

03:33.933 --> 03:35.482
I know.

03:38.737 --> 03:40.437
Would you like some of these?

03:41.941 --> 03:44.107
So what happened
to field hockey?

03:44.109 --> 03:47.277
If I'm on the yearbook,
I won't be a benchwarmer.

03:47.329 --> 03:50.447
Well, can you quit before I buy
you cleats and a stick next time?

03:50.499 --> 03:52.366
I'm going to sell everything.

03:52.418 --> 03:54.284
You know how much
Madrid's going to cost?

03:54.336 --> 03:56.336
I'm not gonna back out of that.

03:56.372 --> 03:57.921
I want to go to Spain.

03:57.957 --> 03:59.590
I want to go to Spain.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.509
You think it'll be more
interesting than Wyoming?

04:03.963 --> 04:06.129
I don't know.
Wyoming had a two-headed cow.

04:06.181 --> 04:07.631
You'll see it on the postcard.

04:08.634 --> 04:10.133
So where's next?

04:10.135 --> 04:13.937
Well, I'm in Kansas right now.

04:15.190 --> 04:17.891
I'm going to take Route 35.

04:17.942 --> 04:20.394
Then over on 40.

04:20.446 --> 04:23.647
<i>Then 89 to the Grand Canyon.</i>

04:23.649 --> 04:26.149
I feel like I'm sitting
right next to you.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.786
Is it cold yet?

04:29.822 --> 04:32.205
A little.
I wouldn't rush home.

04:32.241 --> 04:34.992
Well, I want to get your brothers
before they go to sleep.

04:35.044 --> 04:36.877
<i>I'll call you next week.</i>

04:36.912 --> 04:38.879
I really want you
to sell that equipment.

04:38.914 --> 04:40.547
You have no idea about money.

04:40.582 --> 04:43.083
I will. Bye.

04:43.135 --> 04:45.002
Bye, sweetheart.

04:58.233 --> 05:00.484
Are you lost?

05:00.519 --> 05:03.403
No, I'm a student here.

05:03.439 --> 05:05.822
Well, see you around.

05:10.696 --> 05:12.279
Oh!

05:12.331 --> 05:13.914
Hey, give her some room.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.783
You okay, lady?

05:16.835 --> 05:19.953
Just my pride.
New shoes.

05:21.874 --> 05:23.757
I think I need a minute.

05:29.598 --> 05:31.348
Duck, how are you?

05:31.383 --> 05:33.216
Fit as a fiddle, thank you.

05:36.555 --> 05:38.555
28th?
That's top brass.

05:38.607 --> 05:40.474
Actually, it's none
of your business.

05:40.526 --> 05:43.860
Don't be coy. You're helping
them replace Don, aren't you?

05:43.896 --> 05:47.064
I've done it before.

05:55.958 --> 05:58.408
Is it true he left behind
a couple million bucks?

06:00.079 --> 06:02.045
Nice to see you.

06:02.081 --> 06:04.915
Actually, let me
ask you something.

06:04.967 --> 06:06.917
Morning, John, Norm.

06:06.969 --> 06:08.418
One month and you're
already the mayor.

06:08.470 --> 06:10.003
They've been very hospitable.

06:10.055 --> 06:11.722
Of course I delivered everyone.

06:11.757 --> 06:13.473
I even brought
Burger Chef back.

06:13.509 --> 06:16.343
And after Joan cashed in,
I saved Avon.

06:16.395 --> 06:17.761
There have been whispers
about Coca-Cola.

06:17.763 --> 06:20.097
No need to impress me.

06:20.099 --> 06:21.815
What do you want?

06:21.850 --> 06:23.433
Not here.

06:26.155 --> 06:28.155
This will just
take a moment, Sarah.

06:30.776 --> 06:32.109
You can't be in here.

06:32.111 --> 06:34.277
Everyone's going to think
I'm looking for a job.

06:34.279 --> 06:36.113
You mind?

06:37.449 --> 06:39.282
They should always
think you're unhappy.

06:39.284 --> 06:42.119
You're wrong. And for the
first time, they don't.

06:42.171 --> 06:45.372
Now go outside and tell everyone you
staggered into the wrong office.

06:45.424 --> 06:48.291
- They'll believe you.
- Look, this isn't about you.

06:49.878 --> 06:52.295
I've been trying to get this
private aviation company

06:52.297 --> 06:53.797
to have me do all their hiring.

06:53.799 --> 06:55.098
But before any of that happens,

06:55.134 --> 06:57.134
they want to review
their overall strategy.

06:57.136 --> 06:59.302
So I want you to go
to dinner and recommend

06:59.304 --> 07:01.438
that they hire an in-house
senior marketing man.

07:01.473 --> 07:03.106
And I'm the guy to find him.

07:03.142 --> 07:04.558
Because you're the best?

07:04.610 --> 07:05.976
Yes.

07:05.978 --> 07:07.978
And then you can extoll
the wonders of McCann.

07:07.980 --> 07:09.312
Everybody wins.

07:09.314 --> 07:10.897
I don't need to poach.

07:10.949 --> 07:13.483
You know, I helped you for
free after that stupid merger.

07:13.485 --> 07:16.870
And then you sent Peggy to Gerald
what's-his-name when she was in need.

07:16.905 --> 07:18.572
This is how I make
my living, Pete.

07:18.624 --> 07:20.407
I've paid you at some point.

07:20.459 --> 07:22.993
You'd want this business if you
knew you couldn't have it.

07:22.995 --> 07:25.796
Learjet is private,
luxury air travel.

07:29.835 --> 07:33.336
Look, Pete, I just have
to fill this one position

07:33.338 --> 07:35.338
and I'll make it
through the winter.

07:35.340 --> 07:37.891
For old times' sake.

07:37.926 --> 07:41.311
Fine. Who is he?

07:41.346 --> 07:45.182
His name is Mike Sherman and he moved
to Wichita from Philly four years ago.

07:45.234 --> 07:47.601
Princeton '52. You should
have a lot in common.

07:47.653 --> 07:49.686
I'm Dartmouth '56.

07:49.688 --> 07:51.354
I know that.

07:51.356 --> 07:53.190
Don't pretend like you're not
gonna jack each other off.

07:54.693 --> 07:56.993
- Sarah.
- Yes, Mr. Campbell?

07:57.029 --> 07:59.996
Would you remind me that I need to
make a donation to Lincoln Center?

08:00.032 --> 08:01.781
Mr. Phillips
was very persuasive.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.167
Thank you for your generosity.

08:10.425 --> 08:12.509
<i>KOMA, fun-loving 1520.</i>

08:12.544 --> 08:13.960
<i>The capital radio...</i>

08:14.012 --> 08:16.963
<i>...for the capital city,</i>
<i>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.</i>

08:22.020 --> 08:23.970
Shit.

08:27.059 --> 08:30.560
<i>Look for clear skies with
a high temperature today of 75.</i>

08:30.562 --> 08:32.729
<i>A pleasant day</i>
<i>here in this pleasant city.</i>

08:32.731 --> 08:34.364
<i>Current temperature is 73.</i>

08:34.399 --> 08:36.066
<i>Beautiful weather</i>
<i>out there today.</i>

08:38.236 --> 08:40.904
Dr. Buckley will be right
with you, Mrs. Robinson.

08:40.956 --> 08:42.873
It's Mrs. Francis.

08:42.908 --> 08:45.742
Oh, the boys who dropped you
off said that was your name.

08:45.744 --> 08:48.461
I think that was a joke.

08:48.497 --> 08:50.130
Oh.

08:50.165 --> 08:52.048
Nurse, could you excuse us?

08:53.835 --> 08:56.920
Mrs. Francis, is it possible
to get your husband down here?

08:56.922 --> 08:58.838
I can drive with a broken rib.

08:58.891 --> 09:00.423
It's not even that sore.

09:00.425 --> 09:02.509
Well, I took a look
at your X-ray

09:02.561 --> 09:05.262
and it may be more serious
than just the rib.

09:06.815 --> 09:08.932
How serious?

09:08.934 --> 09:12.519
You can use the phone
at the nurses' station.

09:22.281 --> 09:23.914
I'm gonna sue them.

09:23.949 --> 09:25.532
First I'm gonna go through
the Health Commission

09:25.584 --> 09:27.284
and I'm gonna look
into their funding.

09:27.286 --> 09:30.253
That quack has some nerve
scaring you like that.

09:30.289 --> 09:32.789
What happens to my car?

09:32.841 --> 09:35.759
I'll send my secretary up here
in a cab tomorrow morning.

09:35.794 --> 09:39.045
And I'm gonna call--
call-- call Jim.

09:39.097 --> 09:40.964
Call--

09:41.016 --> 09:42.632
You know what?

09:42.634 --> 09:44.968
I'll just call Rocky's office.
That's what I'm gonna do.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.470
Henry, I want to go home.

09:47.472 --> 09:50.307
Babe, look at me.

09:52.144 --> 09:54.277
You're gonna be just fine.

10:21.506 --> 10:22.589
Afternoon.

10:22.641 --> 10:24.507
Wyatt called from
the service station.

10:24.509 --> 10:26.643
We've got our best
available for you.

10:28.263 --> 10:30.180
If you threw a rod,
it's gonna take some time.

10:30.232 --> 10:32.148
It's the rocker arm.

10:32.184 --> 10:36.519
Well, I've got a weekly for
$37 or a daily for six.

10:36.521 --> 10:38.238
Let's take it
a night at a time.

10:38.273 --> 10:39.689
I'm an optimist.

10:39.691 --> 10:42.859
Oh, hello.

10:42.861 --> 10:44.661
This is my wife Sharon.

10:44.696 --> 10:46.613
Of the Sharon Motel.

10:46.665 --> 10:48.581
This is Donald from New York.

10:48.617 --> 10:50.700
- Don.
- Pleasure to have you with us.

10:50.702 --> 10:53.620
Do you know where
I could get a meal?

10:53.672 --> 10:55.789
There's a cafe a couple
of miles up the road.

10:55.841 --> 10:57.507
He's got car trouble.

10:58.510 --> 11:00.093
Well, I made a roast.

11:00.128 --> 11:02.212
How'd you like leftovers
as room service?

11:02.264 --> 11:04.631
I don't want you
to go to the trouble.

11:04.683 --> 11:06.132
Do you have vending machines?

11:06.184 --> 11:07.801
You can have both.

11:07.853 --> 11:10.887
Give him some change and
have Andy take his luggage.

11:10.889 --> 11:12.305
This is all I got.

11:12.357 --> 11:14.307
Here's two dimes and a nickel.

11:14.359 --> 11:15.859
There you go.

11:22.567 --> 11:25.201
I believe that's one of the
best steaks I've ever had.

11:25.237 --> 11:28.071
Well, it's the best because
they flew it out from Kansas.

11:28.123 --> 11:29.906
Isn't Wichita cattle country?

11:29.958 --> 11:31.241
It sure is.

11:31.243 --> 11:32.742
But I was disappointed
when I got there

11:32.744 --> 11:34.327
that I didn't see
more ten-gallon hats.

11:34.379 --> 11:37.297
But your company is very glamorous.

11:37.332 --> 11:41.384
As far as I can tell, its entire public
reputation is based on Hollywood.

11:41.420 --> 11:43.887
Well, we thought we'd go with
our most exciting customers.

11:45.173 --> 11:48.341
Elizabeth Taylor.
Danny Kaye.

11:48.393 --> 11:50.343
Somebody you want to meet?

11:50.395 --> 11:52.395
Not really.

11:52.431 --> 11:54.814
In fact, I think that's the
problem if you have one.

11:54.850 --> 11:56.933
I have one, or I wouldn't
be talking to you.

11:56.935 --> 12:00.070
Corporate executives should
be your core business.

12:00.105 --> 12:02.572
You can read that
without glasses?

12:02.607 --> 12:06.576
I've looked at your business
and I think Duck's right.

12:06.611 --> 12:08.695
You need a senior
marketing executive.

12:08.747 --> 12:10.163
And not just anyone.

12:10.198 --> 12:11.781
You need someone comfortable

12:11.833 --> 12:15.085
with the kind of boardroom leaders
that see Learjet as a tool,

12:15.120 --> 12:18.121
not a frivolous extravagance for
movie stars and their pets.

12:19.424 --> 12:21.791
McCann could run circles
around Carson Roberts.

12:21.793 --> 12:23.293
But we wouldn't
even be interested

12:23.295 --> 12:25.795
unless Duck found the right
man for your company.

12:27.466 --> 12:29.099
I don't understand.

12:29.134 --> 12:31.634
Are you advocating for
your agency or for yourself?

12:31.636 --> 12:33.603
We're one and the same.

12:33.638 --> 12:35.555
Well, the jobs are not
one and the same.

12:35.607 --> 12:37.974
You can't work for McCann
and work for us.

12:40.145 --> 12:42.228
I'm aware of that.

12:42.280 --> 12:45.448
But I couldn't agree with
you more about who we need.

12:45.484 --> 12:48.284
I told Duck I was looking
for a real knickerbocker.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.820
Right schools, right family.

12:50.872 --> 12:52.822
Someone who can rap
his ring on the table

12:52.824 --> 12:55.291
and let everyone know
they're with a friend.

12:55.327 --> 12:57.710
Well, I'm flattered.

12:57.746 --> 13:00.797
But I'm afraid Duck Phillips has
tricked me into a job interview.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.750
I stand by my analysis,

13:03.802 --> 13:06.252
but I'm very happy where I am.

13:06.304 --> 13:08.588
I expect him to lie to me.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.140
I didn't expect him
to lie to you.

13:10.175 --> 13:11.641
I'm glad we got to meet.

13:11.676 --> 13:14.010
Likewise.
That's never a mistake.

13:16.014 --> 13:17.480
You want a brandy?

13:17.516 --> 13:18.932
Because Duck's going
to get the check.

13:24.322 --> 13:26.189
<i>Well, unfortunately,
we've discovered</i>

13:26.241 --> 13:28.274
<i>that the cancer has spread</i>
<i>from the lung</i>

13:28.326 --> 13:30.944
<i>and metastasized to the bones</i>

13:30.996 --> 13:33.413
<i>and to lymph nodes</i>
<i>in the mediastinum.</i>

13:33.448 --> 13:35.949
<i>I don't understand
what you're saying.</i>

13:36.001 --> 13:39.118
It's aggressive
and it's very advanced.

13:39.171 --> 13:41.838
I wish there was better news.

13:41.873 --> 13:43.957
What do we do?

13:44.009 --> 13:46.543
Well, I'm going to recommend
a radiation oncologist

13:46.545 --> 13:48.127
for therapy to help
mend the rib.

13:48.180 --> 13:52.048
It won't heal without it.
Then a medical oncologist.

13:52.050 --> 13:55.385
She could have
nine months to a year,

13:55.437 --> 13:58.771
but these treatments
are usually palliative.

14:00.192 --> 14:02.141
I'm so sorry.

14:11.781 --> 14:13.364
Oh, sorry about that.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.033
You should put the sign out.

14:15.068 --> 14:17.118
You're the maid?

14:17.153 --> 14:19.203
And the messenger.

14:21.958 --> 14:24.542
I guess they didn't know
you were in here.

14:24.577 --> 14:27.128
Wyatt called. It's a
bushing on the rocker arm,

14:27.163 --> 14:29.080
but it's got
to come from Tulsa.

14:29.082 --> 14:31.716
So I'm gonna need another book.

14:31.751 --> 14:33.635
The chlorine's killed
the piss in the pool by now.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.003
You can go for a swim.

14:36.306 --> 14:37.889
Anything else
to do around here?

14:39.592 --> 14:42.143
There's football at the
high school Friday night.

14:42.178 --> 14:44.846
Revival church every night.

14:44.898 --> 14:46.431
Fairview's got
a drive-in,

14:46.483 --> 14:48.016
but you don't have a car.

14:49.486 --> 14:50.985
Where can I get a drink?

14:51.021 --> 14:53.655
That's a little complicated.

14:53.690 --> 14:56.274
But I probably can
rustle up a bottle.

14:59.829 --> 15:01.162
That'd be great.

15:01.197 --> 15:02.830
Andy.

15:02.866 --> 15:04.115
You want me to clean up?

15:04.167 --> 15:06.417
Don. Maybe tomorrow.

15:40.153 --> 15:42.120
<i>There she is.</i>

15:42.155 --> 15:44.155
<i>Don't run.</i>

15:58.638 --> 16:00.922
I'm in Grand Central.
Come down.

16:00.974 --> 16:03.057
Only to throw you
under a train.

16:03.093 --> 16:04.976
Come on.

16:05.011 --> 16:06.594
I only have one question.

16:06.646 --> 16:08.613
I better have gotten
that lousy job.

16:08.648 --> 16:10.515
You did, and it's not lousy.

16:10.567 --> 16:12.984
I haven't even negotiated,
we're already at 100 a year.

16:13.019 --> 16:16.154
All benefits and unlimited
private jet travel.

16:16.189 --> 16:18.022
It's a flying limousine, Pete.

16:18.074 --> 16:20.191
You can have lunch in New
York and be back for dinner.

16:20.193 --> 16:22.693
Good, because I live here.
I have to go.

16:22.695 --> 16:25.663
- He wants to have dinner with wives.
- No.

16:25.698 --> 16:27.582
He's only meeting
with you and one other guy.

16:27.617 --> 16:29.200
Two last-round dinners.

16:29.252 --> 16:30.952
Help me turn it
into a horse race.

16:31.004 --> 16:33.788
How many times do you think
you can lie to this man?

16:33.840 --> 16:36.591
We both told him you didn't want the job.
What's the lie?

16:36.626 --> 16:39.710
Well, for one thing,
I don't have a wife.

16:39.763 --> 16:42.547
For the other,
I have four years left

16:42.599 --> 16:44.132
on my contract with McCann

16:44.184 --> 16:47.018
and a million dollars
contingent on my presence.

16:47.053 --> 16:50.772
Uh-huh, so now we know
there's a price.

16:50.807 --> 16:53.191
You're talking to yourself.

16:53.226 --> 16:54.976
Have dinner.
Yuck it up.

16:55.028 --> 16:56.727
Don't you want
to sign him one day?

16:56.729 --> 16:59.147
You know the corporate royalty
on those planes?

16:59.199 --> 17:01.699
<i>7:30 Saturday.</i>

17:01.734 --> 17:03.401
Grill Room at the Four Seasons.

17:03.403 --> 17:05.736
Your wife's under the weather,
but you didn't want to miss it.

17:16.833 --> 17:20.084
There's two guys. Hy Epstein wants
to start treatment immediately

17:20.136 --> 17:22.587
<i>and he's conducting a study</i>
<i>at New York Hospital.</i>

17:22.589 --> 17:24.505
The other one--

17:24.557 --> 17:26.339
can't read my own writing.

17:26.392 --> 17:28.759
He's a surgeon.
Very aggressive.

17:28.761 --> 17:30.261
But he's in Bethesda.

17:30.263 --> 17:33.397
Stop brushing your hair.
How's the rib gonna heal?

17:33.433 --> 17:35.149
My rib's not
going to heal, Henry.

17:35.185 --> 17:37.935
You can't waste any more
time being in shock.

17:37.987 --> 17:40.521
- You have to do something.
- Do what?

17:40.573 --> 17:43.024
What do you think would happen
if Nelson Rockefeller got this?

17:43.076 --> 17:44.775
He would die!

17:44.777 --> 17:47.495
Betty, do you want the kids
to hear you talk that way?

17:47.530 --> 17:51.115
I don't want them to hear anything
until I've decided what to tell them.

17:51.117 --> 17:53.117
That's what's
on my mind, Henry.

17:53.169 --> 17:55.786
Do you want to help with that, or do
you want to keep chasing your tail?

17:55.788 --> 17:57.371
You're being morose.

17:57.423 --> 17:59.841
You're a very lucky woman.
You have been your whole life.

17:59.876 --> 18:01.843
Stop yelling at me.

18:18.728 --> 18:20.311
Thanks for the books.

18:22.315 --> 18:24.315
It's $10.

18:24.317 --> 18:26.150
I gave you $10.

18:26.152 --> 18:27.785
It was hard to get.

18:29.122 --> 18:31.289
I'm not paying $20
for a bottle of whiskey

18:31.324 --> 18:33.074
and a couple of paperbacks
somebody left behind.

18:33.126 --> 18:34.792
You've got the money.

18:34.827 --> 18:36.994
I walked into town.
And it's hard for me.

18:36.996 --> 18:38.579
I got flatfeet.

18:53.846 --> 18:56.314
- You want one?
- No, sir.

18:56.349 --> 18:59.066
I'm one-eighth Comanche.
Can't ever touch it.

18:59.102 --> 19:01.852
Folks know the hustle you're
running out of their motel?

19:01.854 --> 19:03.604
My folks are over in Woodward.

19:03.656 --> 19:06.490
And ain't none of their
business how I get rich.

19:06.526 --> 19:08.075
That's true.

19:09.696 --> 19:11.412
How'd you get rich?

19:11.447 --> 19:14.332
I was in
the advertising business.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.450
You make commercials on TV?

19:16.502 --> 19:17.702
Lots of them.

19:17.704 --> 19:19.870
So many you don't
have to work no more?

19:19.923 --> 19:21.455
Anymore.

19:22.959 --> 19:24.759
All right.
Well, I'm around.

19:38.608 --> 19:41.025
Don't forget to take
the pie Tammy made you.

20:25.422 --> 20:27.817
Sorry to bother you,
but my TV just died.

20:27.857 --> 20:29.940
Oh, well, we'll get
you a new one.

20:29.993 --> 20:32.943
Soon as I'm done
fighting this battle.

20:49.262 --> 20:50.544
There you go.

20:50.596 --> 20:52.963
Then it comes loose.

21:08.448 --> 21:11.782
You're the quick brown fox.

21:11.818 --> 21:13.367
Did you learn to type
in the army?

21:13.403 --> 21:15.152
No, night school.

21:15.154 --> 21:16.654
Were you in the service?

21:16.656 --> 21:18.789
Yes.

21:18.825 --> 21:21.959
Well, everybody who's a vet
and likes drinking

21:21.994 --> 21:23.744
will be at the Legion
on Saturday night.

21:23.796 --> 21:26.464
My husband would be tickled
if you joined him.

21:26.499 --> 21:28.049
Why didn't he ask me?

21:28.084 --> 21:31.419
Oh, he's gonna.
Soon as he spies a chance.

21:31.471 --> 21:34.755
He could sure use someone new
to tell his stories to.

21:34.807 --> 21:36.424
I don't know that I'll be here,

21:36.476 --> 21:38.142
unless you know something
about my car that I don't.

21:38.177 --> 21:41.679
Wyatt's gonna overcharge you,
but he'll get the work done.

21:41.731 --> 21:43.347
Let's get that TV

21:43.349 --> 21:45.933
so you can get back
to relaxing.

21:52.909 --> 21:54.408
Hello?

21:59.248 --> 22:00.948
The whole pie is for you.

22:03.202 --> 22:04.452
Eat with me.

22:05.705 --> 22:07.254
There were two pies.

22:07.290 --> 22:09.290
I'm not gonna tell you what
happened to the other one.

22:15.098 --> 22:16.764
I have a favor to ask of you.

22:16.799 --> 22:18.432
I can repay you.

22:18.468 --> 22:21.051
I'll take her for a weekend next month.
You can go away.

22:21.053 --> 22:22.853
What?

22:22.889 --> 22:26.023
I have a dinner
with a potential client

22:26.058 --> 22:27.441
and I'd love for you
to join me.

22:27.477 --> 22:28.859
No.

22:28.895 --> 22:31.445
Thankfully, that's no longer
one of my obligations.

22:31.481 --> 22:33.114
You used to love it.

22:33.149 --> 22:37.151
I daresay it got you excited
trying to close over coffee.

22:37.203 --> 22:38.869
I never closed anything.

22:38.905 --> 22:40.571
I was just trying
to stay awake.

22:40.623 --> 22:44.241
Trudy, you understand
my business.

22:44.243 --> 22:45.793
No one else ever really has.

22:45.828 --> 22:49.630
Well, I'm not comfortable being
your date under any circumstances.

22:49.665 --> 22:52.716
Well, then,

22:52.752 --> 22:55.586
how about for old times' sake?

23:01.427 --> 23:04.929
You know, I'm jealous
of your ability

23:04.931 --> 23:07.681
to be sentimental
about the past.

23:07.733 --> 23:09.567
I'm not able to do that.

23:09.602 --> 23:11.852
I remember things as they were.

23:15.658 --> 23:17.408
It's late.

23:17.443 --> 23:19.243
I'd like to turn off
the lights.

23:21.330 --> 23:25.082
Well, good night, then.

23:25.117 --> 23:26.750
Good night.

23:36.538 --> 23:37.704
Because she got kicked
out of Brearley.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.540
Hold on. Easy.

23:40.626 --> 23:42.375
What are you doing here?

23:42.461 --> 23:44.377
You're not supposed
to be in here.

23:44.463 --> 23:46.213
Could you leave us
alone, sweetheart?

23:47.216 --> 23:49.216
Oh, of course.

23:52.604 --> 23:54.721
Come have a seat.

24:03.699 --> 24:06.283
I have some serious news.

24:06.318 --> 24:08.068
It's bad news.

24:13.709 --> 24:15.959
Your mother is sick.

24:15.994 --> 24:19.045
She has lung cancer
and it's very advanced.

24:21.049 --> 24:22.966
I'm very sorry.

24:24.837 --> 24:26.219
I've got to call her.

24:26.255 --> 24:27.754
She doesn't want
you kids to know.

24:27.756 --> 24:29.089
Then why are you telling me?

24:29.091 --> 24:31.258
Because there's hope
she could have more time.

24:31.260 --> 24:34.511
People do. It's a tough
road, but it's a chance.

24:35.514 --> 24:37.013
Well, that's good.

24:37.065 --> 24:39.099
But she won't do it.

24:39.151 --> 24:41.268
I don't know if she's just
being stubborn or vain,

24:41.320 --> 24:42.819
but she won't even hear of it.

24:42.855 --> 24:45.405
Henry, my ears
are still buzzing.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.607
I don't understand you.

24:47.609 --> 24:50.243
I breached her confidence
because I want you

24:50.279 --> 24:52.612
to talk some sense into her.

24:52.614 --> 24:54.614
She'll listen to you.

24:57.169 --> 24:59.619
I wouldn't know what to say.

25:03.542 --> 25:06.042
It's okay for you
to cry, honey.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.627
Jesus, what am I going to do?

26:03.936 --> 26:05.735
How's she running?

26:05.771 --> 26:07.854
Good as new.

26:07.856 --> 26:10.273
I suppose you're gonna
be on your way, then.

26:10.325 --> 26:11.441
I should settle up.

26:11.493 --> 26:13.526
Sure I can't talk you
into joining us tonight?

26:13.528 --> 26:15.946
I should get going.

26:15.998 --> 26:18.198
Mister, I know
you're not in a rush.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.834
We got plenty of tourists
with cars in the shop.

26:20.869 --> 26:23.670
You made two phone calls
in six days.

26:23.705 --> 26:25.171
Wyatt thought you ran away.

26:25.207 --> 26:27.424
I don't know.

26:27.459 --> 26:29.376
Tell you what.

26:30.712 --> 26:32.345
I'll throw in the room tonight

26:32.381 --> 26:35.015
and I'll give you another night
if you fix the Coke machine.

26:35.050 --> 26:37.517
I don't think I can
help you with that.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.719
I know you were right
about your car.

26:39.771 --> 26:41.972
And Sharon said she
caught you being handy.

26:42.024 --> 26:43.940
Don't they fix it?

26:43.976 --> 26:46.109
They want to give me a new one,

26:46.144 --> 26:48.561
but I like this one.
I'll get my tools.

27:00.659 --> 27:02.325
<i>Hello?</i>

27:02.377 --> 27:04.411
<i>Smells good.</i>

27:06.214 --> 27:08.298
I brought you a surprise.

27:22.180 --> 27:24.014
Betty.

27:26.651 --> 27:28.852
What are you doing here?

27:28.904 --> 27:30.937
I got in trouble
at school again.

27:32.274 --> 27:33.907
What'd you do?

27:33.942 --> 27:35.859
I don't want to talk about it.

27:37.913 --> 27:39.362
Are we supposed to eat?

27:39.414 --> 27:42.198
Genie, come over here.

28:05.690 --> 28:09.559
So, I'm going to tell you
in advance

28:09.611 --> 28:12.362
that I know we seem
like fine people,

28:12.397 --> 28:14.364
but I've been
a little dishonest.

28:14.399 --> 28:15.899
Okay.

28:15.951 --> 28:18.568
This is a fundraiser

28:18.620 --> 28:19.986
for Al Bettendorf over there.

28:20.038 --> 28:22.572
His house burned down.
Well, the kitchen.

28:22.624 --> 28:25.208
The most expensive room.

28:25.243 --> 28:27.327
There's a fine jar.

28:32.667 --> 28:36.252
We're just strangers,
but it does include barbecue

28:36.304 --> 28:37.804
and I'm getting your drinks.

28:42.427 --> 28:44.511
$40 for Don!

28:47.315 --> 28:49.983
What's your rank
and where did you serve?

28:50.018 --> 28:51.651
7th Infantry.
Korea.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.186
Rank?

28:54.606 --> 28:55.905
Lieutenant.

28:55.941 --> 28:58.741
Lieutenant,
7th Infantry, Korea.

28:58.777 --> 29:00.994
Shit, we should be paying him.

29:03.365 --> 29:05.999
That's $5 for swearing.

29:07.002 --> 29:08.368
What are you drinking?

29:15.710 --> 29:17.377
I'll just have
the shrimp cocktail.

29:17.429 --> 29:21.297
Well, as Mother used to say,
"You're not that fat."

29:22.684 --> 29:25.351
No, I have a--
well, something came up.

29:25.387 --> 29:28.354
Since I invited you?

29:28.390 --> 29:31.024
You're always complaining
we never see each other.

29:31.059 --> 29:33.526
Then I ask you to dinner,
miss a very important meeting,

29:33.562 --> 29:35.228
and you have other plans?

29:35.230 --> 29:38.231
It was very short notice.

29:38.233 --> 29:42.402
If you need an alibi,
you're going to have to ask.

29:42.404 --> 29:44.654
Please.

29:47.042 --> 29:48.575
Now, what did you want
to talk about?

29:50.078 --> 29:52.245
Let me ask you something.

29:52.297 --> 29:55.165
How do you know when something's
really an opportunity?

29:56.718 --> 29:58.468
I'm wrong sometimes,

29:58.503 --> 30:00.720
but the girls
aren't shy nowadays.

30:00.755 --> 30:03.973
No, I meant in your career.

30:04.009 --> 30:08.178
Oh. Well, in banking there's a
road and you just stay on it.

30:08.230 --> 30:10.647
Still, you're required
to assess risk.

30:10.682 --> 30:12.599
Pete, I don't buy
or sell anything.

30:12.601 --> 30:15.652
I just distribute
and it's never up to me.

30:15.687 --> 30:18.821
Fine, forget your business.

30:18.857 --> 30:20.857
You're taking a risk tonight.

30:20.909 --> 30:24.611
So now you're jealous and you're
trying to ruin my evening.

30:24.663 --> 30:26.446
Your wife knows.

30:26.498 --> 30:27.947
I'm not asking you
to imagine it,

30:27.999 --> 30:29.449
I'm telling you she knows.

30:29.501 --> 30:32.085
And how do you feel
now that you know that?

30:32.120 --> 30:35.288
Judy's always loved that I was
attractive to other women.

30:35.290 --> 30:36.873
It's part of what
she likes about me.

30:36.925 --> 30:38.374
I'm just supposed
to turn that off?

30:38.426 --> 30:40.376
You're not supposed
to act on it.

30:40.428 --> 30:43.429
But I always have.
That's the way we are.

30:43.465 --> 30:46.933
But why? Always looking
for something better.

30:46.968 --> 30:49.185
Always looking
for something else.

30:49.221 --> 30:51.387
Because Dad was like that.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.641
He really was, wasn't he?

30:57.779 --> 30:59.479
You know, once at
the polo grounds,

30:59.531 --> 31:03.483
some jeweler thanked him profusely
for buying a diamond necklace.

31:03.535 --> 31:07.120
Dad got very cross and called off
the sale right in front of me.

31:07.155 --> 31:10.907
He kept muttering
how the man was indiscreet.

31:10.959 --> 31:13.126
I looked it up.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.213
I didn't need
any detective work.

31:17.249 --> 31:19.048
I just saw the way
women looked at him.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.671
You really think she knows?

31:24.673 --> 31:27.590
I think it feels good
and then it doesn't.

31:29.227 --> 31:31.811
I have to make a phone call.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.730
Don't listen to me.

31:33.765 --> 31:35.982
I'll be right back.

31:41.131 --> 31:43.715
And Wayne's dad ran
the drugstore before Wayne.

31:43.767 --> 31:46.301
He was all 10 Commandments
rolled into one.

31:47.554 --> 31:51.940
He caught us smoking,
stealing, cussing.

31:51.975 --> 31:54.109
My wife went to high
school with these two.

31:54.144 --> 31:55.777
They were hooligans.

31:55.812 --> 31:59.314
I didn't break the real
Commandments till I was in Europe.

31:59.316 --> 32:01.533
Were you in Europe, Don?

32:01.568 --> 32:03.618
Don was in Korea.

32:03.654 --> 32:06.821
You don't just need new glasses,
you need a new hearing aid.

32:06.823 --> 32:09.708
Well, he hasn't said anything.

32:09.743 --> 32:11.793
Did you
introduce him to--

32:11.828 --> 32:14.913
Hey, Jerry!
Jerry Fandango!

32:14.965 --> 32:16.081
Get over here.

32:17.668 --> 32:19.751
Jerry served in Korea.

32:19.803 --> 32:22.504
So, you know, maybe
you've seen him before.

32:22.506 --> 32:24.339
What the fuck
do you farts want?

32:24.341 --> 32:28.009
- Gerald Fanning, this is--
- Don was in Korea.

32:28.011 --> 32:30.512
You two can reminisce.

32:31.682 --> 32:33.148
I don't want to talk about it.

32:33.183 --> 32:36.568
Jerry Fanning.
PFC, 34th Infantry.

32:36.603 --> 32:38.687
Come on, let me see your face.

32:42.326 --> 32:44.826
When and where?

32:44.861 --> 32:47.662
It was before they called it a war.
Near the Yalu River.

32:47.698 --> 32:49.781
Oh, hell.

32:49.833 --> 32:53.284
I wasn't there
till Christmas '53.

32:54.921 --> 32:56.705
I was home by then.

32:57.708 --> 32:58.957
Have a seat.

32:59.009 --> 33:00.592
No, I got one.

33:00.627 --> 33:02.794
Tell you one thing about Korea.

33:02.846 --> 33:04.546
They can keep it.

34:07.811 --> 34:08.976
Go away.

34:09.029 --> 34:10.478
<i>What the hell happened to you?</i>

34:10.530 --> 34:12.196
<i>You stood me up.</i>

34:13.617 --> 34:15.483
Get in here.

34:17.487 --> 34:19.286
I never said I would go.

34:19.322 --> 34:22.572
You did, and Mike was waiting
with Charlene at the Grill Room

34:22.626 --> 34:24.292
for an hour!

34:24.327 --> 34:26.661
For heaven's sake,
you're drunk.

34:26.713 --> 34:29.547
And you're being
very menacing right now.

34:29.581 --> 34:31.916
I'm happy.
Listen to me.

34:31.967 --> 34:33.251
You're on a streak.

34:33.303 --> 34:35.053
You're on one
of those magic--

34:35.088 --> 34:36.838
we used to call it a trend.

34:36.889 --> 34:39.891
You know, because of the graph
where the line just goes up.

34:39.926 --> 34:42.393
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:42.429 --> 34:44.846
Mike called me
from his hotel room.

34:44.898 --> 34:46.230
He was pretty sore.

34:46.266 --> 34:47.849
So I told him that
you wanted to come,

34:47.851 --> 34:49.600
but you were insulted
by the offer.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.686
- You what?
- He wants to do it all.

34:51.737 --> 34:54.155
Company car, company
plane, signing bonus.

34:54.190 --> 34:55.489
And he's gonna get you
out of McCann.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.275
He's gonna give me
a million dollars?

34:57.327 --> 34:59.327
He's gonna get very close
with stock options

34:59.362 --> 35:01.029
and McCann's gonna
cut a deal for the rest

35:01.031 --> 35:02.747
because you're gonna help them.

35:02.782 --> 35:05.249
Learjet's a tiny account.
It's peanuts to them.

35:05.285 --> 35:07.585
You're not the client.
Your passengers are.

35:07.620 --> 35:10.672
Jim Hobart's very excited about
who flies on those planes.

35:10.707 --> 35:12.957
Every important CEO in America.

35:13.009 --> 35:14.926
You talked to Jim Hobart?

35:14.961 --> 35:16.878
You know what $100
buys you in Wichita?

35:16.880 --> 35:18.379
A two-bedroom house.

35:18.431 --> 35:19.797
You stupid wino.

35:19.849 --> 35:22.433
You're going to
destroy everything!

35:22.469 --> 35:24.552
Who's going to win
the World Series this year?

35:24.604 --> 35:26.104
I don't know.

35:26.139 --> 35:28.056
You are!

35:28.058 --> 35:29.891
Because you are charmed,
my friend.

35:29.943 --> 35:31.693
Good night, Duck.

35:33.813 --> 35:36.948
I've been there.
It doesn't last long.

35:46.626 --> 35:49.077
So the doctor says,
"Sorry, son,

35:49.079 --> 35:51.329
but your pecker's got gangrene.

35:51.381 --> 35:53.047
We're gonna have
to amputate."

35:54.217 --> 35:56.467
So the GI goes
to the Jap doctor.

35:56.503 --> 36:00.138
"Oh, good news.
No need to amputate.

36:00.173 --> 36:02.807
In three days will
fall off by itself."

36:06.646 --> 36:08.730
To Don!

36:08.765 --> 36:12.350
For being generous
and not saying shit.

36:12.402 --> 36:14.819
I don't know that many jokes.

36:14.854 --> 36:16.521
Oh, just leave him alone.

36:16.573 --> 36:18.406
Don, you're not allowed to say,

36:18.441 --> 36:20.825
"I don't want to talk
about it" in this place.

36:20.860 --> 36:22.443
That's why I never joined.

36:22.495 --> 36:24.912
You're not listening to me.

36:24.948 --> 36:28.116
You're among friends.

36:28.118 --> 36:30.251
Floyd, tell him.

36:31.788 --> 36:34.756
- Floyd!
- What?

36:34.791 --> 36:37.341
Tell him about
the Hurtgen Forest.

36:38.795 --> 36:40.711
Give me a drink.

36:40.764 --> 36:42.263
Tell him the story first.

36:43.516 --> 36:45.099
Oh, shit.

36:49.055 --> 36:50.772
You know where it is?

36:52.525 --> 36:55.810
It's on the border
between Belgium and Germany.

37:03.903 --> 37:06.204
We were cut off.

37:06.239 --> 37:08.239
Three of us.

37:09.325 --> 37:11.659
Actually...

37:11.711 --> 37:14.078
there were nine of us
originally.

37:17.467 --> 37:21.085
We came on a machine gun nest.

37:23.256 --> 37:26.891
There were four Krauts in
there looking to surrender.

37:26.926 --> 37:30.595
They had their hands in the
air with their papers.

37:30.647 --> 37:33.848
They were starving.
Don't skip that.

37:33.900 --> 37:36.818
We were starving.

37:36.853 --> 37:39.020
Scrounging for grub.

37:39.022 --> 37:41.489
We were boiling bark.

37:45.445 --> 37:48.029
So there's three of us,

37:48.081 --> 37:50.498
four of them,

37:50.533 --> 37:52.500
and more snow coming.

37:56.339 --> 37:58.372
You did what you had to do.

38:01.261 --> 38:03.294
What did you do?

38:05.965 --> 38:09.100
Someone made them
start digging.

38:09.135 --> 38:11.886
And we bounced them.

38:11.938 --> 38:13.938
One at a time.

38:16.693 --> 38:19.360
Took a couple of hours.

38:19.395 --> 38:22.146
One of them was so skinny,
he tried to run away,

38:22.198 --> 38:24.398
his pants fell down.

38:28.121 --> 38:30.538
You know they all
got blue eyes.

38:35.578 --> 38:38.412
You just do what you
have to do to come home.

38:43.887 --> 38:45.753
I killed my CO.

38:53.096 --> 38:55.346
We were under fire.

38:57.150 --> 38:59.317
Fuel was everywhere.

39:01.437 --> 39:03.854
And I dropped my lighter.

39:06.409 --> 39:08.442
And I blew him apart.

39:13.750 --> 39:16.083
And I got to go home.

39:20.206 --> 39:24.592
That is the name of the game.

39:28.681 --> 39:31.265
Hey, where is that kid?

39:31.301 --> 39:33.134
We need a bottle over here!

39:33.186 --> 39:35.019
Over here!

39:35.054 --> 39:37.972
Over here!

39:37.974 --> 39:41.359
♪ Get that kid
with the booze over here... ♪

39:42.695 --> 39:45.646

39:45.648 --> 39:47.732

40:15.645 --> 40:18.229
- Did I wake you?
- No.

40:28.574 --> 40:31.158
Henry shouldn't
have scared you.

40:31.194 --> 40:33.995
I wanted to tell you myself.

40:34.030 --> 40:36.447
He doesn't know
you won't get treatment

40:36.499 --> 40:38.416
because you love the tragedy.

40:38.451 --> 40:40.618
Sally, I've learned

40:40.670 --> 40:43.170
to believe people when
they tell you it's over.

40:43.206 --> 40:47.124
They don't want to say it,
so it's usually the truth.

40:47.176 --> 40:49.377
Henry said you could
have a year.

40:49.429 --> 40:51.462
And what would
that year be like?

40:51.514 --> 40:53.381
I'll be with you.

40:53.383 --> 40:55.049
I won't let you give up.

40:56.302 --> 40:58.102
I know that.

40:59.272 --> 41:02.306
But I watched my mother die.

41:02.358 --> 41:04.275
I won't do that to you.

41:06.279 --> 41:08.396
And I don't want you
to think I'm a quitter.

41:08.448 --> 41:11.232
I fought for plenty in my life.

41:11.234 --> 41:14.201
That's how I know
when it's over.

41:14.237 --> 41:16.487
It's not a weakness.

41:16.539 --> 41:18.205
It's been a gift to me.

41:20.793 --> 41:22.743
To know when to move on.

41:29.085 --> 41:31.919
These are instructions.

41:31.971 --> 41:34.004
Open it the minute
you know I'm gone.

41:36.059 --> 41:38.426
- No.
- Listen to me.

41:38.478 --> 41:41.095
Things happen very quickly
when people die.

41:41.147 --> 41:44.148
Henry's not going to
be able to handle things.

41:49.772 --> 41:51.522
You're going back
to school in the morning.

41:51.574 --> 41:53.741
I don't want you
alarming your brothers.

42:00.583 --> 42:02.366
Go back to sleep.

42:19.469 --> 42:21.852
What the hell?

42:21.888 --> 42:23.437
We want our money.

42:23.473 --> 42:24.855
What?

42:24.891 --> 42:26.190
We know you took the money.

42:26.225 --> 42:29.777
Let me go!
Sharon, what's going on?

42:29.812 --> 42:32.480
Your car was fixed. You
should have been on your way.

42:33.866 --> 42:36.817
Now, I don't know
who the hell you are,

42:36.819 --> 42:39.954
but you've got five Mississippi
to get our money back.

42:39.989 --> 42:41.956
I didn't take your money.

42:42.959 --> 42:44.458
You threw all that money around

42:44.494 --> 42:45.993
'cause you knew
you'd get it back.

42:52.168 --> 42:53.918
I mean business!

42:55.254 --> 42:57.588
You really think I need
your spare change?

43:09.852 --> 43:13.270
Give us the cash and you
can have your car back.

43:13.322 --> 43:16.740
- Probably stolen.
- We'll find out.

43:40.832 --> 43:42.631
My God, what's wrong?

43:42.667 --> 43:44.416
I need to speak with you.

43:44.418 --> 43:45.918
My goodness,
it's 4:00 in the morning.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.503
Is everything all right?

43:53.227 --> 43:55.344
You're scaring me.
Please, what is it?

43:55.396 --> 43:57.596
It's good news.
Catch your breath.

43:57.648 --> 44:01.233
What on earth is going on?

44:01.269 --> 44:03.936
I was offered a job tonight.

44:03.938 --> 44:06.105
Because its origins
were supernatural,

44:06.157 --> 44:08.774
I realized that its
benefits might be as well.

44:09.994 --> 44:12.945
I want you and Tammy
to come with me.

44:12.947 --> 44:16.282
I want you to relocate to
Wichita, pick out a house,

44:16.334 --> 44:19.118
and be my wife
and family again.

44:21.122 --> 44:24.707
Peter, I'm not
dismissing you...

44:25.960 --> 44:28.127
I'm saying with
respect to whatever

44:28.129 --> 44:30.296
is happening in
your eyes right now,

44:30.348 --> 44:33.048
we both know things
can't be undone.

44:33.100 --> 44:35.184
Says who?

44:35.219 --> 44:37.770
We're not even through
half our lives.

44:37.805 --> 44:41.557
And even if we are,
we're entitled to more.

44:41.609 --> 44:43.309
Of what?

44:44.812 --> 44:47.112
Then we're entitled
to something new.

44:49.483 --> 44:51.233
I want to start over.

44:52.870 --> 44:55.154
And I know I can.

44:56.324 --> 44:58.123
I'm not so dumb anymore.

44:58.159 --> 45:01.126
I'm not ignoring the fact that I
could actually lose your love.

45:02.914 --> 45:04.880
You never lost it.

45:04.916 --> 45:07.800
But I will never allow you
to hurt me again.

45:09.637 --> 45:11.637
I love you, too.

45:13.090 --> 45:15.507
I always have.

45:15.509 --> 45:18.143
I've never loved anyone else.

45:18.179 --> 45:19.845
Never.

45:25.736 --> 45:28.270
You think you can come in here

45:28.322 --> 45:30.189
when I'm all disoriented

45:30.241 --> 45:33.025
and say the things I wanted you
to say to me two years ago

45:33.027 --> 45:34.827
and make me run away with you?

45:34.862 --> 45:38.447
I said it to you 10 years
ago and I'll say it again.

45:38.499 --> 45:40.115
I do.

45:44.038 --> 45:46.205
Wichita is beautiful.

45:46.207 --> 45:48.340
And wholesome.

45:48.376 --> 45:51.210
And not the city
and not Cos Cob.

45:51.262 --> 45:53.595
And you'll have a plane
to use at your disposal.

45:53.631 --> 45:54.847
We will.

45:54.882 --> 45:58.550
To pick up and go anywhere
anytime we want.

45:58.552 --> 46:01.387
Like driving to Montauk.

46:01.439 --> 46:03.856
I want to go
everywhere with you.

46:09.447 --> 46:12.448
Say yes with your voice,
not just your eyes.

46:14.485 --> 46:16.235
Oh!

46:34.255 --> 46:36.422
How will I explain
this to Tammy?

46:38.142 --> 46:42.177
Tell her her birthday
wish came true.

46:48.602 --> 46:51.020
I'm gonna go.

46:51.072 --> 46:53.939
And we're gonna have
dinner on Saturday night.

46:53.991 --> 46:55.858
The three of us.

46:56.944 --> 46:58.861
Like it was the first time.

47:15.763 --> 47:17.546
Good morning.

47:45.126 --> 47:47.159
This one's on the house.

47:49.997 --> 47:52.581
What do you want to know?
You want to know what I told them?

47:52.633 --> 47:54.416
I'm just being
a good citizen, man.

47:54.468 --> 47:57.169
You don't know anything about me.
I could kill you right now.

47:57.171 --> 47:58.971
You took that money
and you set me up.

48:00.424 --> 48:02.224
I don't know what
you're talking about.

48:02.259 --> 48:04.176
You have shitty instincts
for a con man.

48:05.646 --> 48:07.346
You're lucky you feel guilty.

48:07.398 --> 48:08.931
That's the one difference between
you and those animals right now.

48:08.983 --> 48:11.517
I don't feel guilty
taking that drunk's money.

48:11.569 --> 48:13.185
He burned his own house down.

48:13.187 --> 48:15.821
He doesn't deserve a pot to
piss in, let alone 500 bucks.

48:15.856 --> 48:17.322
You're gonna get me that money,

48:17.358 --> 48:19.108
pack your bag,
and get out of town.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.860
I can't leave
without that money.

48:21.862 --> 48:24.413
I know you think
you know how to hustle,

48:24.448 --> 48:27.533
but this is a big crime,
stealing these people's money.

48:27.535 --> 48:30.953
If you keep it, you'll have
to become somebody else.

48:31.005 --> 48:33.288
And it's not
what you think it is.

48:35.342 --> 48:38.260
You cannot get off
on that foot in this life.

48:38.295 --> 48:40.095
What do you care?

48:40.131 --> 48:42.381
You got money.
I know you got money.

48:42.433 --> 48:44.850
I cleaned your room
and didn't take nothing.

48:44.885 --> 48:46.051
Anything.

48:46.053 --> 48:47.553
You think this town is bad now?

48:47.555 --> 48:49.471
Wait until you can
never come back.

48:49.523 --> 48:51.306
Can I go?

48:51.358 --> 48:53.225
Go get the money.

49:25.893 --> 49:27.759
I'm not paying for the room.

49:38.439 --> 49:40.606
Could you drop me off
at the bus stop?

49:44.828 --> 49:46.111
Get in.

49:59.627 --> 50:01.677
I'm off.

50:01.712 --> 50:04.046
- Where are you going?
- I have class.

50:05.382 --> 50:07.015
Why are you doing that?

50:07.051 --> 50:09.935
Why was I ever doing it?

50:30.374 --> 50:31.990
<i>"Dear Sally,</i>
