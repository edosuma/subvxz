WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:02.460
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.460 --> 00:03.670
828 wing nuts
shouldn't be allowed

00:03.670 --> 00:05.290
to carry
the badge and gun.

00:05.290 --> 00:08.090
Adrian's making the rest of
the world scared to death of us.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.260
The rest of the world
needs to open their eyes!

00:10.260 --> 00:12.720
I was able to confirm
elimination of the 828 anomaly

00:12.720 --> 00:14.090
in a Petri dish.

00:14.090 --> 00:16.510
Now I need to test the serum
on a living specimen.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.010
The Calling said
"save the passengers."

00:18.010 --> 00:19.310
To me, that means
tracking them down

00:19.310 --> 00:21.140
and finding out who knows
something we don't.

00:21.140 --> 00:22.980
Grace:
The star represents hope.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.190
The woman said it was
what her future held.

00:25.190 --> 00:26.270
She gave it to Olive.

00:26.270 --> 00:27.270
How is this possible?

00:27.270 --> 00:29.070
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.280
Michaela,
this is Courtney.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.110
His wife.

00:38.370 --> 00:41.330
♪ You can't stop this train ♪

00:41.330 --> 00:44.170
Zeke?

00:44.170 --> 00:45.120
Hey, man.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.420
How you doing, man?

00:46.420 --> 00:48.130
Never better!
Aah!

00:48.130 --> 00:49.380
Must be love.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.510
Just might be.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.680
I got
some new merchandise.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.220
First two are on me.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.190
I don't mean to scare you,

01:04.190 --> 01:06.350
but I think there's a girl
in my bed.

01:06.350 --> 01:08.520
Uh-oh.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.360
I've heard they can be
very, very dangerous.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.150
I hope you brought her something
to keep her happy.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.240
Pink's my color.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.550
Now, what are we
gonna do today?

01:30.550 --> 01:33.550
You've already chosen pink.

01:33.550 --> 01:35.800
P-I-N-K.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.260
Okay, what number?

01:37.260 --> 01:38.430
You're crazy.

01:38.430 --> 01:42.350
Um...three.

01:42.350 --> 01:44.180
Okay.

01:46.190 --> 01:49.270
It says
we should get married.

01:57.030 --> 01:58.030
Ohh.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.450
I'm just kidding.

01:59.450 --> 02:02.330
It says,
"Go to the movies."

02:05.370 --> 02:08.080
Unless...

02:08.080 --> 02:12.420
Unless we should
just get married.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.670
Courtney: And we did.
We got married.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.340
'Cause that's how we were
back then --

02:19.340 --> 02:22.350
wild, impulsive...

02:22.350 --> 02:25.060
in love.

02:25.060 --> 02:28.850
But this guy and I,
we were also toxic together.

02:28.850 --> 02:31.270
We fed
each other's addictions.

02:31.270 --> 02:35.900
But he finally found a path
out of all of that.

02:35.900 --> 02:42.330
He's sober, dating
a police detective, happy.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.620
And he's trying to help me
find a path out, too.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.130
You asked for it.

02:55.130 --> 02:56.840
This is
"a few things"?

02:56.840 --> 02:59.430
Yeah, well, Grace has been
spending a lot of time

02:59.430 --> 03:00.510
in the house lately.

03:00.510 --> 03:01.840
Since the accident?

03:01.840 --> 03:04.760
And apparently, waging
a holy war on clutter.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.430
Hmm.
If this is too much,
I can --

03:06.430 --> 03:08.520
No, I could always
use three whisks.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.730
You are now a proud owner
of a slightly used air bed.

03:11.730 --> 03:13.230
Actually, this is good.

03:13.230 --> 03:15.270
It'll give Courtney a nice break
from the couch.

03:15.270 --> 03:18.030
Zeke just forget to mention
he had a wife?

03:18.030 --> 03:19.780
No, to be clear,
they were high as kites,

03:19.780 --> 03:21.570
so they never actually
filed the paperwork.

03:21.570 --> 03:23.410
They were never
legally married,

03:23.410 --> 03:25.410
and they broke up like a year
before he went into the woods.

03:25.410 --> 03:27.200
Oh. Okay. That doesn't
make it weird at all

03:27.200 --> 03:28.960
that she's been on your couch
for a week.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.540
Look, Zeke dealt with my drama
with Jared.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.750
He carried it all the way
to Rikers, so it's my turn.

03:32.750 --> 03:35.750
I mean, part of his sobriety
is making amends with the past,

03:35.750 --> 03:36.750
so he's helping her.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.130
It's fine.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.510
It's awful.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.300
Look, I'm trying
to be supportive,

03:42.300 --> 03:44.760
and she's actually really nice,
but I just want her gone.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.430
Well, I got some good news
for you.

03:46.430 --> 03:49.520
There's a hole
in the air bed.

03:55.020 --> 03:57.730
Alright.
Now you're even.

03:57.730 --> 04:00.240
Yeah?
Can I look?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.320
Mm-hmm.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.330
How you feel?

04:13.370 --> 04:15.540
Like a new man.

04:15.540 --> 04:18.420
You know, I feel like
an accessory to a crime.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.470
Didn't you tell your dad we're
doing tarot-card research today?

04:20.470 --> 04:21.880
And we will.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.970
You know, my mom used to
volunteer at a soup kitchen.

04:25.970 --> 04:27.510
There was this Buddhist Temple
that had one in it.

04:27.510 --> 04:29.970
Sometimes I'd go.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.270
So, your mom
was Buddhist?

04:33.270 --> 04:35.020
She was
a lot of things.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.360
When I came back
and she was gone,

04:37.360 --> 04:40.820
I, uh, had my own mini
Buddhist memorial rite for her.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.360
Did it help?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.740
Kind of.

04:43.740 --> 04:46.410
I could...feel her.

04:46.410 --> 04:49.200
It's an honor
to have you here.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.660
Oh. Okay.

04:50.660 --> 04:51.660
Where do we start?

04:51.660 --> 04:52.910
-No.
-I...

04:52.910 --> 04:54.960
No, no.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.500
You have to go.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.880
What?
Why?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.340
Your dad was very clear.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.590
'Cause you're a minor,
I have to comply.

05:01.590 --> 05:04.090
I'm sorry.

05:04.090 --> 05:05.430
Okay.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.390
If we're turning away
the very people

05:10.390 --> 05:12.560
who experienced the miracle
firsthand,

05:12.560 --> 05:15.270
how are we going to get the rest
of the world to believe?

05:15.270 --> 05:18.060
There'll be another miracle,
Isaiah.

05:18.060 --> 05:20.230
An even bigger one.

05:20.230 --> 05:21.480
I --

05:23.900 --> 05:26.030
Ben: Grace? Good news.

05:26.030 --> 05:28.620
Your whisks officially
have a new home.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.080
What is it?

05:34.580 --> 05:37.330
Hi! This is Jane Hawley
of New York Life.

05:37.330 --> 05:40.090
Our magazine is doing a cover
feature on your pregnancy.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.460
The first 828 baby
is a big story,

05:42.460 --> 05:44.420
and we'd love to interview you
for the article.

05:44.420 --> 05:46.840
Call us back --

05:46.840 --> 05:48.300
How did she find out?

05:48.300 --> 05:49.600
So many people
have seen us

05:49.600 --> 05:51.010
coming and going
from the hospital.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.890
I guess -- I guess
we can't hide it anymore.

05:53.890 --> 05:55.230
I don't want anyone else
to know.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.520
I don't want
the Xers to know.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.810
I don't want the Believers
to know.

05:57.810 --> 05:59.190
It's none
of their business.

05:59.190 --> 06:00.440
It's just two people
having a baby.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.940
There's no story here.

06:01.940 --> 06:06.400
It's not like it's a plane
coming back from the past.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.530
Ben?

06:10.320 --> 06:13.450
Great marriage pep talk.
Thank you.

06:13.450 --> 06:15.500
Michaela!

06:15.500 --> 06:17.580
That was really sweet
of you.

06:17.580 --> 06:19.630
You must be drunk.

06:22.630 --> 06:25.170
Saanvi!
Saanvi!

06:25.170 --> 06:27.430
Ben, please help!
You have to help!

06:27.430 --> 06:30.850
Wait!
Wait, Saanvi!

06:39.100 --> 06:40.480
Was that a Calling?

06:40.480 --> 06:43.150
I think Saanvi's
in trouble.

06:43.150 --> 06:44.860
Is she still hiding out
with Vance?

06:44.860 --> 06:46.190
No, not anymore.

06:46.190 --> 06:47.700
Even the former
director of the NSA

06:47.700 --> 06:49.240
couldn't keep her
from her research.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.820
Go.
I'll stay here with Cal.

06:50.820 --> 06:52.410
Just call me
if you need anything.

06:52.410 --> 06:53.490
Alright.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.710
Hey, Captain.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.540
Did you, um, hear from
Internal Affairs about the leak?

07:00.540 --> 07:04.340
Hey, Stone. You get any proof
there is a leak?

07:04.340 --> 07:07.970
Someone tipped off the Xers
right before that bust.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.630
I have a feeling
someone --

07:09.630 --> 07:11.760
Do I strike you as someone who's
interested in your feelings?

07:11.760 --> 07:14.680
Stop pointing fingers
and go catch a bad guy.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.020
Goodbye.

07:18.310 --> 07:20.390
Hey.
Sorry about that.

07:20.390 --> 07:22.900
I do have a lead on
an attempted burglary, though,

07:22.900 --> 07:24.480
if you want to...

07:26.320 --> 07:27.990
Go. I got it.
I'm sorry.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.570
I got this.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.570
Whoa!
What's up with the new do?

07:32.570 --> 07:36.990
Where's she going without you?

07:36.990 --> 07:40.040
Yeah.
Good luck.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.290
Saanvi? You in there?

07:44.290 --> 07:45.800
Come on, open up.

07:54.050 --> 07:55.930
Saanvi!

07:55.930 --> 07:57.640
-Saanvi!
-Hey.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.230
Is she in there?
I think so.
Her phone's in there.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.560
Hey. Excuse me.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.560
Can we get this door open,
please?

08:08.980 --> 08:11.450
-Get a doctor right now!
-Right away!

08:11.450 --> 08:12.570
Saanvi.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.580
Hey. Thanks.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.500
You know, with the hours
Saanvi's been keeping,

08:27.500 --> 08:28.710
she probably just collapsed
from exhaustion.

08:28.710 --> 08:29.960
I'm not so sure.

08:29.960 --> 08:33.130
I swiped this from the floor
next to her.

08:33.130 --> 08:34.680
Saanvi: I've prepped myself,

08:34.680 --> 08:36.760
and I will begin Phase One
of Human Trials.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.350
She was experimenting
on herself?

08:39.350 --> 08:41.270
Why would she do that?
That's so dangerous.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.600
She blames herself for the Major
getting her research,

08:43.600 --> 08:45.400
and now she feels
she has to...catch up.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.270
Well, she can't catch up
if she's dead.

08:47.270 --> 08:48.690
Dr. Rand: Excuse me.

08:48.690 --> 08:50.480
Dr. Bahl
is going to be fine,

08:50.480 --> 08:52.650
but she's very lucky
you found her when you did.

08:52.650 --> 08:55.030
You'll be able to see her
in a few minutes.

08:55.030 --> 08:56.160
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

09:00.580 --> 09:02.830
I got to go.
Can you let me know how she is?

09:02.830 --> 09:03.830
Yeah.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.750
Okay, so, most versions
of the Star Card

09:09.750 --> 09:11.300
show a woman at a river.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.300
This one
has a peacock.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.970
And a peacock is what helped you
figure out the Death Date.

09:15.970 --> 09:17.600
Yeah.
So, why would
the tarot reader

09:17.600 --> 09:19.810
give you and your mom a card
in the first place?

09:19.810 --> 09:21.600
Wouldn't that make
the deck incomplete?

09:21.600 --> 09:23.350
I supposed you would have to ask
the reader who gave it to us,

09:23.350 --> 09:24.810
but I don't know her name,

09:24.810 --> 09:27.020
nor do I know the name
of her business.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.820
It was literally a stand
on the sidewalk.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.820
We could go look for her.

09:32.820 --> 09:34.570
Field trip.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.780
Let's do it.

09:45.330 --> 09:47.290
It's kinda hard
to stay mad at you

09:47.290 --> 09:49.670
since you may just have
saved my life.

09:49.670 --> 09:51.380
Well...

09:51.380 --> 09:53.460
then I'll be mad at you.

09:55.340 --> 09:57.430
You were testing
on yourself?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.220
Saanvi, you were the one
that told me

09:59.220 --> 10:00.810
that testing on people
is unethical

10:00.810 --> 10:03.720
and it would never be considered
unless the patient is terminal.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.810
We are terminal.
That's what I'm working on, Ben.

10:05.810 --> 10:08.190
If there's a chance
to cure the Death Date,

10:08.190 --> 10:09.860
I have to figure it out.
That is on me.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.780
And how are you gonna do that
if you're dead and buried?

10:13.780 --> 10:16.070
You know what, Saanvi?
You've got to promise me

10:16.070 --> 10:18.070
you're not gonna test
on yourself again.

10:18.070 --> 10:20.870
I'll try, but --
No. Promise me.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.540
Saanvi, if we hadn't
had that Calling,

10:22.540 --> 10:23.990
if you hadn't asked me
to help you, I --

10:23.990 --> 10:28.460
Wait. In the Calling,
I wasn't asking you to help me.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.330
You didn't see the boy?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.040
Hey, are you okay?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.920
Hey, can you hear me?
Where are your parents?

10:36.920 --> 10:40.260
Help.

10:40.260 --> 10:43.060
Saanvi!
Saanvi!

10:43.060 --> 10:44.770
Help! Help!
You have to help, Ben!

10:44.770 --> 10:46.770
No, no.
Saanvi! Wait!

10:50.020 --> 10:51.520
That must have been

10:51.520 --> 10:53.190
right as I was passing out
from the hypoxia.

10:53.190 --> 10:55.440
Which explains why you
faded away in the Calling.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.860
I-I did see the kid
but only for a few seconds

10:57.860 --> 11:01.280
after you...disappeared.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.240
But Cal was the youngest kid
on 828.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.490
We both saw him.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.960
Okay, so it was 14C.
That was Finn Nowak.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.330
Wall Street guy.
We need to talk to Finn.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.170
That little boy
desperately needs our help.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.670
We have to find him.

11:14.670 --> 11:17.340
You are a patient here
who's not been discharged.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.760
I go talk to Finn.
Well, keep me in the loop.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.430
Hey.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.390
You memorized
the seating chart?

11:23.390 --> 11:25.930
Are you surprised?

11:25.930 --> 11:27.980
No, I'm impressed.

11:32.980 --> 11:35.020
I-I --
It was over there.

11:35.020 --> 11:38.570
It was under a black tent.
But...

11:38.570 --> 11:40.320
I don't know.
It's been three years.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.410
I can't remember.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.240
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.830
I came here last year
with a classmate.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.450
She's 25 now.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.660
Was she
your girlfriend?

11:48.660 --> 11:52.830
I don't really have too many
friends, much less girlfriends.

11:52.830 --> 11:54.380
Not that I wouldn't
want a girlfriend.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.880
And, you know, it's, uh --

11:55.880 --> 11:57.800
It'd be different if I,
you know, met the right person.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.920
No. Yeah.
Yeah.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.170
Exactly. You just --

12:00.170 --> 12:03.590
You just haven't met
the right person yet.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.890
I mean, I haven't
not met that person.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.810
It's just not too many people
know what it's like

12:12.810 --> 12:14.190
to be an 828er.

12:14.190 --> 12:17.110
Yeah. I bet.
It's complicated.

12:17.110 --> 12:18.900
Yeah.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.610
Just a bit.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.780
Is that it?

12:24.780 --> 12:28.240
Not even close, but let's
just see if she knows anything.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.790
Great.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.670
Vision of being
back on the plane?

12:33.670 --> 12:36.540
No. No, I haven't had
anything like that.

12:36.540 --> 12:40.460
So, you wouldn't know why
we saw a kid in your seat?

12:40.460 --> 12:43.760
Probably 5 or 6,
dark hair, dark eyes.

12:43.760 --> 12:44.760
No idea.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.850
I don't have a wife,
no kids, so...

12:46.850 --> 12:50.770
Definitely didn't
bring one to Jamaica.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.140
I was there
for a bachelor party.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.730
The funny thing is,

12:54.730 --> 12:56.980
I wasn't even supposed to
be on that plane.

12:56.980 --> 13:01.190
Yeah, me neither.
Last-minute voucher grab.

13:01.190 --> 13:02.650
What's your story?

13:02.650 --> 13:05.610
We went to this beach party
the night before,

13:05.610 --> 13:09.870
and I met this amazing woman,
Orlena.

13:09.870 --> 13:12.080
Smart, funny.
New Yorker.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.370
We just connected.

13:15.370 --> 13:16.960
Next morning,
she was gone.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.050
I went looking for her,
and I missed my plane.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.800
I ended up on 828.
That one little decision.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.300
Screwed up
pretty much everything.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.970
Yeah.

13:29.010 --> 13:30.600
That's him.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.390
That's the kid who was
on the plane in your seat.

13:33.390 --> 13:35.190
That's impossible.

13:35.190 --> 13:39.020
That's a childhood photo...

13:39.020 --> 13:40.440
of me.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.210
Zeke!
Who did this?

13:56.210 --> 13:59.040
Same people who did that
to Courtney.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.550
What the hell happened?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.970
Hi.
Excuse me.

14:11.970 --> 14:15.230
Um, do you know about
a tarot-card reader

14:15.230 --> 14:17.140
here about
three years ago?

14:17.140 --> 14:18.600
Sorry, I don't do
missing persons.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.730
Okay, then can you tell us
about this?

14:24.940 --> 14:28.910
It's a Star Card
from the Major Arcana.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.530
Corresponding to Aquarius
and Air Elements.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.990
Okay, uh,
but can you tell us

14:33.990 --> 14:35.870
the deck where
that card came from?

14:35.870 --> 14:39.580
Yeah.
I know this deck.

14:39.580 --> 14:42.340
Uh...

14:43.500 --> 14:45.590
It's called the Alzeraz deck,
I think.

14:45.590 --> 14:46.800
Stunning artwork.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.470
Alzeraz.
Okay, that's something.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.930
Okay, there's nothing
on Amazon or eBay.
Oh, no, no, no.

14:51.930 --> 14:54.390
This deck has been out of print
for decades.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.850
I do know a few places
in New York

14:58.850 --> 15:01.110
that sell rare
and out-of-print things,

15:01.110 --> 15:03.230
if you have some time
to dig around.

15:08.990 --> 15:12.740
So, this has something
to do with Finn's childhood?

15:12.740 --> 15:15.200
Young Finn shows up in a Calling
and asks for help?

15:15.200 --> 15:16.450
No, that can't be right.

15:16.450 --> 15:19.830
Let me, um,
see his photo again.

15:19.830 --> 15:21.250
Here.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.040
Maybe it's not
the same kid.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.420
Just a strong
family resemblance.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.710
He said he didn't
have any kids.

15:30.090 --> 15:31.840
Unless...

15:31.840 --> 15:33.720
Finn said he had
a one-night stand

15:33.720 --> 15:35.260
the night before
he left Jamaica.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.770
And the kid would be 5,
which seems about the same age

15:37.770 --> 15:39.430
as the kid that we saw
in the Calling.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.560
What do you know about
the one-night stand?

15:41.560 --> 15:43.610
Oh, not much.
He remembered her name.

15:43.610 --> 15:47.070
It was, um, Orlena
from New York.

15:47.070 --> 15:51.320
And we also know a due date --
40 weeks after April 7, 2013.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.490
If we try to find
all the --

15:52.490 --> 15:54.120
There were
only three Orlenas

15:54.120 --> 15:56.200
that gave birth that year
in New York --

15:56.200 --> 15:58.250
two in the spring and...

15:58.250 --> 16:03.330
Orlena Prager that gave birth
to a baby boy November 30, 2013.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.500
Named him Theo.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.090
Surprised?

16:09.090 --> 16:11.550
Impressed.

16:11.550 --> 16:14.510
So, what does Theo
need from us?

16:14.510 --> 16:16.810
I don't know.
Let's go talk to Orlena.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.850
I'm sorry.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.850
I didn't come here
just to get sober.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.440
I came here because
I thought Lucas

16:25.440 --> 16:27.020
wouldn't be able
to find me.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.280
Who's Lucas?

16:28.280 --> 16:29.480
He's a dealer.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.990
I owe him money.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.070
I thought I could pay it back
little by little.

16:34.070 --> 16:35.160
How much?

16:36.330 --> 16:37.580
$20,000.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.950
Jesus, Court!

16:38.950 --> 16:40.160
I know.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.250
I didn't think he'd be able
to find me here,

16:42.250 --> 16:43.540
but his guys followed me.

16:43.540 --> 16:46.540
They were just passing along
a message.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.170
Which was what?

16:48.170 --> 16:49.840
That I work for Lucas now.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.050
No way.
Absolutely not.

16:52.050 --> 16:53.220
Really?

16:53.220 --> 16:55.300
Do you have an extra 20K
just lying around?

16:55.300 --> 16:56.220
Because I don't.

16:56.220 --> 16:57.970
I'm stuck.

16:57.970 --> 17:00.970
If I don't go work for Lucas,
he's gonna have me killed.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.310
Hey.
Are you sure you're okay?

17:06.310 --> 17:07.730
Yeah.

17:07.730 --> 17:08.940
I should have come
without you.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.110
We both had the Callings.

17:10.110 --> 17:13.110
We're supposed to
do it together.

17:13.110 --> 17:16.110
I hope we're right about this.

17:22.580 --> 17:24.790
Hi. I'm Saanvi Bahl.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.540
This is Ben Stone.
Hi.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.500
We wanted to talk to you
about your son Theo.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.170
We're hoping we can help
in some way.

17:34.170 --> 17:35.720
In what way?

17:35.720 --> 17:37.430
We're not exactly sure.

17:37.430 --> 17:39.550
Do you remember
Finn Nowak?

17:39.550 --> 17:41.140
Man: Come on, kids.
Grab some groceries.

17:41.140 --> 17:42.640
You should go.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.640
Let's see who brings the bag
with the special treat.

17:45.640 --> 17:49.150
Please,
I-I have nothing to say.

17:49.150 --> 17:51.480
Saanvi: Mrs. Prager,
we know that you had a son

17:51.480 --> 17:53.740
less than a year after
you took a trip to Jamaica.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.530
Those are
my three children.

17:55.530 --> 17:59.570
And that man is my husband of
10 years, and he's their father.

17:59.570 --> 18:02.200
And he's a good father.
Please, just go.

18:04.370 --> 18:06.000
Saanvi:
Now what do we do?

18:06.000 --> 18:10.170
I don't know, but the husband's
not Theo's father.

18:10.170 --> 18:13.010
Still, I don't get the Calling.
Theo looks fine.

18:13.010 --> 18:16.220
I saw terror in that child's
eyes on the plane.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.340
We have to help him.

18:26.060 --> 18:28.020
Okay,
this is something.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.900
Tell me what you got.
It's not Alzeraz.

18:30.900 --> 18:35.400
It's the "Al-Zuras Deck,"
created by Yusuv Al-Zuras,

18:35.400 --> 18:39.280
a 16th-century Egyptian scholar
and artist.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.280
Yusuv Al-Zuras.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.080
Scholar,
traveled around Europe.

18:46.410 --> 18:48.460
Whoa.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.330
What?

18:50.330 --> 18:53.210
Uh, according to legend,
he was lost at sea for 10 years

18:53.210 --> 18:56.420
and mysteriously returned.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.300
Really?

18:58.300 --> 19:01.010
That sounds...familiar.

19:01.010 --> 19:05.180
Yeah. "Upon returning,
he claimed he could"...

19:06.430 --> 19:07.770
What?

19:07.770 --> 19:10.770
What is it?

19:10.770 --> 19:12.440
"Upon returning,
he claimed

19:12.440 --> 19:14.860
he could hear the voice of God
in his head."

19:14.860 --> 19:18.360
Does this mean
it's happened before?

19:18.360 --> 19:21.280
I don't know.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.990
Okay, it doesn't say
when he died,

19:22.990 --> 19:26.240
but I'm assuming it's 10 years
after he returned?

19:26.240 --> 19:28.290
Which means the Calling
led us to Al-Zuras

19:28.290 --> 19:30.120
to show that the Death Date
was real.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.590
Okay, well, we have no idea
when this guy died.

19:33.590 --> 19:38.760
For -- For all we know, he could
have lived another 30 years.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.430
Hey, maybe the Calling
led us to this guy

19:41.430 --> 19:44.260
because he survived
the Death Date.

19:44.260 --> 19:45.310
Yeah.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.720
You know what you need?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.230
A tarot reading.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.360
Oh.

19:55.360 --> 20:00.320
This -- See the man
in the jeggings?

20:00.320 --> 20:01.450
It's Emo Drake.

20:02.820 --> 20:07.830
And he's doing a slow jam
with a mandolin.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.500
And if I'm reading
the cards right,

20:09.500 --> 20:11.710
they say it's your favorite kind
of music.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.330
Yeah, but it is...

20:13.330 --> 20:15.290
Mm.
...not.

20:15.290 --> 20:18.510
And I'm pretty sure
that's a lute.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.880
Uh, now,
you see this card.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.510
This is a glowing path,

20:25.510 --> 20:28.770
illuminating the way
to true love.

20:28.770 --> 20:33.940
Yeah, that just looks so much
like a volcano and some lava.

20:33.940 --> 20:36.150
But whatever you say.

20:37.190 --> 20:39.320
What about
the third card?

20:44.990 --> 20:46.780
The heart and the crown?

20:46.780 --> 20:48.450
It's a strawberry.

20:48.450 --> 20:52.120
And that is
a fancy pie pan.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.330
Mm-hmm.

20:53.330 --> 20:54.960
Which means
you're gonna have

20:54.960 --> 20:58.380
a very fancy strawberry pie
in your future.

20:58.380 --> 21:02.420
You, sir,
have a bright, shining,

21:02.420 --> 21:06.760
and, uh,
very lucky future.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.760
Yeah.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.270
You're right.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.640
I am lucky.

21:17.230 --> 21:18.440
Thanks.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.650
I don't get you.

21:21.650 --> 21:25.570
How many women would let
their boyfriend's junkie ex

21:25.570 --> 21:28.030
stay with them?

21:28.030 --> 21:31.410
I'm a big believer
in second chances.

21:31.410 --> 21:33.290
Zeke said that,

21:33.290 --> 21:35.370
that you were the biggest part
of his recovery.

21:35.370 --> 21:37.920
No, no, Zeke wanted to get sober
on his own.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.540
It had nothing
to do with me.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.050
I don't know.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.420
I've seen Zeke try to get clean
plenty of times.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.840
We'd swear we were
gonna stop using,

21:46.840 --> 21:49.010
but he always had
a backup plan.

21:49.010 --> 21:53.020
He'd stash a couple pills
in a sock drawer,

21:53.020 --> 21:57.940
the barrel of his razor,
dryer sheets.

21:57.940 --> 22:02.440
But with you,
he seems pretty determined.

22:02.440 --> 22:08.530
We all have a limited time
on Earth.

22:08.530 --> 22:12.370
And I think that he's just
trying to live an honest life.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.500
Is it okay
if I take a shower?

22:17.500 --> 22:20.710
I need to get the feeling
of their hands off me.

22:20.710 --> 22:22.670
Of course. Yeah.

22:22.670 --> 22:24.510
Okay, cool, man.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.760
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'll see you.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.510
Okay, I'll be there soon.
Alright. Bye.

22:27.510 --> 22:29.340
Who was that?

22:29.340 --> 22:30.300
Lucas.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.430
I'm going
to deal with this.

22:31.430 --> 22:32.970
Zeke, no.

22:32.970 --> 22:35.560
Part of making amends
is not endangering yourself.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.730
How do you know she's not just
gonna buy from someone else?

22:37.730 --> 22:39.100
I don't.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.360
But I do know I turned my back
on my sister

22:41.360 --> 22:42.980
when she needed me
the most.

22:42.980 --> 22:45.440
I won't do that again.

22:56.580 --> 22:59.120
I'm coming with you.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.880
I'm the one who needs to
make amends, not you.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.130
I'm keeping you out of this.
It's not up to you.

23:04.130 --> 23:06.550
We're supposed to
do this together.

23:06.550 --> 23:07.590
You had a Calling.

23:07.590 --> 23:08.760
Snowflakes.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.050
Just like right before
we found you.

23:12.050 --> 23:13.680
Old-school.

23:14.850 --> 23:17.560
Lucas is a really scary guy,
Mick.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.520
Yeah, and I'm a cop.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.940
Once Lucas takes the money
and we get the pills,

23:27.940 --> 23:29.360
I'll signal you, okay?

23:29.360 --> 23:30.990
You sure you don't want
to requisition

23:30.990 --> 23:32.700
some high-tech gear
from one room over?

23:32.700 --> 23:34.490
I mean, this is basically
a Dixie cup on a string.

23:34.490 --> 23:37.040
I still think there's a leak.
I don't want to risk it.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.620
Alright. Got it.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.420
Dixie cups it is.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.090
I have a son.

23:47.090 --> 23:49.510
A son.

23:49.510 --> 23:51.640
I just...

23:51.640 --> 23:53.680
I've missed
five birthdays.

23:53.680 --> 23:54.850
It's not your fault.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.930
I have to
make it up to him.

23:56.930 --> 23:59.560
No, I want to.
I'm his father.

23:59.560 --> 24:04.610
Actually, when you met Orlena,
she was...

24:04.610 --> 24:06.520
she was married.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.570
I never would have --

24:09.570 --> 24:11.700
That wasn't your fault, either.
You didn't know.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.240
And the guy has no idea
that Theo isn't his?

24:15.240 --> 24:16.700
It seems that way.

24:16.700 --> 24:19.660
Orlena was pretty clear
that her husband

24:19.660 --> 24:22.540
is a very involved,
very loving father.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.800
But I can insist on visits,
right?

24:26.800 --> 24:28.760
Legally, yes.

24:28.760 --> 24:33.680
But you'd be risking blowing up
a happy family.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.180
I don't want to do that.

24:36.180 --> 24:38.930
But I should
get to meet Theo.

24:38.930 --> 24:41.390
Just once.

24:41.390 --> 24:44.560
Do you think you can
make that happen?

24:44.560 --> 24:46.150
Are you sure?

24:46.150 --> 24:50.240
Because as a father,
I have to say...

24:50.240 --> 24:53.320
I think it'd be harder
to walk away than you think.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.700
Okay, we'll try.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.250
I mean, we have to try.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.000
The Callings were clear.
Theo needs our help.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.500
And maybe that means
he needs your help, too.

25:06.580 --> 25:09.130
Lucas: Hey, Zeke!
it's been forever!

25:09.130 --> 25:10.800
So, where you been hiding?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.840
Uh, in a cave.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.760
I believe it.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.180
Well, the parties haven't
been the same without you.

25:17.180 --> 25:18.760
I'm sorry.
Where are my manners?

25:18.760 --> 25:20.100
I'm Lucas.
Ella.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.810
Nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you.

25:21.810 --> 25:23.640
Sit down, Ella.

25:25.230 --> 25:27.770
♪ Pour it down his throat ♪

25:27.770 --> 25:29.650
So, you spoke
to Courtney.

25:29.650 --> 25:33.190
Yeah. She says she's in bad
with you right now.

25:33.190 --> 25:36.610
Are you surprised?
No.

25:36.610 --> 25:40.370
I'll buy at over market value,
sell half, give you a cut,

25:40.370 --> 25:42.370
repay Courtney's debt
within a week.

25:42.370 --> 25:47.580
That girl still has got you
under her spell, doesn't she?

25:47.580 --> 25:49.040
♪ ...and an inhaler ♪

25:49.040 --> 25:51.090
-No offense.
-None taken.

25:51.090 --> 25:53.510
Those two were crazy.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.470
I mean,
Court was off the hook.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.890
That girl liked to party.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.800
What about you, Ella?

25:59.800 --> 26:01.640
You like to party?

26:01.640 --> 26:04.020
Well, I'm not just here
for the '90s decor.

26:04.020 --> 26:06.270
Well, I'm glad
to hear that.

26:06.270 --> 26:09.110
See, I know Zeke,
and I trust him.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.650
But I don't know you.

26:11.650 --> 26:15.900
So, let's consider this...

26:15.900 --> 26:18.030
sort of a trust exercise.

26:23.370 --> 26:25.580
What are you
talking about?

26:25.580 --> 26:29.080
She's gonna need to shoot up
before anything goes down.

26:29.080 --> 26:33.670
♪ Ain't gonna wait
for tomorrow ♪

26:33.670 --> 26:36.550
♪ You know you never should ♪

26:37.970 --> 26:41.180
Do you think any of this
has to do with the Death Date?

26:41.180 --> 26:42.890
Why would you say that?

26:42.890 --> 26:43.850
I don't know.

26:43.850 --> 26:45.770
'Cause it's better
than thinking

26:45.770 --> 26:48.810
the Callings
are just toying with us.

26:48.810 --> 26:50.980
I think we're supposed to
just help Theo.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.860
How's this help him?

26:52.860 --> 26:56.110
I mean, Finn sees him once,
then what?

26:56.110 --> 26:57.650
I don't know.

26:58.990 --> 27:00.700
Hey.

27:00.700 --> 27:02.620
Is she here?

27:07.870 --> 27:10.540
My God, you look
exactly the same.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.590
It's just this one meeting,
right?

27:13.590 --> 27:16.630
Then I'll leave,
if that's what Theo needs.

27:16.630 --> 27:17.670
It is.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.720
Theo.
Theo, come here for a sec.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.850
I want you
to meet some friends.

27:23.850 --> 27:27.890
This is Ben and Saanvi,
and this is Finn.

27:27.890 --> 27:29.600
Hi.
Hi.

27:29.600 --> 27:33.360
It's so nice
to meet you.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.280
I like your rock.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.320
It's not a rock.
It's a very still frog.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.530
It's very still.

27:41.530 --> 27:43.910
Can I tell you
a secret?

27:43.910 --> 27:44.870
Sure.

27:44.870 --> 27:46.870
It's actually a rock.

27:46.870 --> 27:49.960
Can we go in there to see
the dinosaurs, please?

27:49.960 --> 27:51.290
Yes, we can.
In a minute.

27:51.290 --> 27:53.170
-Okay.
-Bye.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.300
Has Theo always
had dark eyes?

28:00.300 --> 28:01.890
No yellow circles?

28:01.890 --> 28:04.760
Nope.
He has my eyes.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.270
Hey, you okay,
chiquito?

28:07.270 --> 28:08.810
I'm fine.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.850
He's -- He's
been tired lately.

28:12.850 --> 28:13.730
We should go.

28:13.730 --> 28:14.810
Wait. Already?

28:14.810 --> 28:17.320
But...I barely...

28:17.320 --> 28:21.320
Look, maybe I could just
be his friend, you know?

28:21.320 --> 28:23.820
Send some gifts
or something, money?

28:23.820 --> 28:26.030
I don't need anything,
and neither does Theo.

28:26.030 --> 28:28.540
Hey, guys.
You ready to go, huh?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.660
Did you fall too hard?

28:30.660 --> 28:32.670
Did you fall
pretty hard?

28:32.670 --> 28:34.000
Theo's having
motor issues.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.460
And in the Callings,
his eyes were different.

28:35.460 --> 28:36.790
They had distinctive
yellow rings,

28:36.790 --> 28:39.380
which is a sign
of liver disease.

28:39.380 --> 28:41.470
And you don't get that
until you're crashing.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.760
That's what the Calling
wanted us to figure out.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.970
Has he seemed disoriented
lately?

28:46.970 --> 28:48.850
Has he fallen asleep
at odd times?

28:48.850 --> 28:51.020
How'd you know that?
Orlena, listen to me.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.730
I am a doctor, and we need
to get Theo to a hospital.

28:55.810 --> 28:56.810
Now.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.990
Zeke:
She's not a needle girl.

29:04.990 --> 29:06.910
Too uptight.
Pills only.

29:06.910 --> 29:08.830
But I'm happy
to take it.

29:12.910 --> 29:15.250
Michaela:
Are you kidding me?

29:15.250 --> 29:18.000
I'm too uptight?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.460
Courtney wasn't too uptight,
right?

29:20.460 --> 29:21.880
Courtney, who apparently still
has you under her spell?

29:21.880 --> 29:23.550
Look, I told you we should've
gone to Colorado.

29:23.550 --> 29:25.050
This guy sucks.

29:25.050 --> 29:26.640
What did you say to me?
Zeke: Alright, back off.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.390
This guy and I have been
through a lot together.

29:28.390 --> 29:29.850
Plus his prices
are way better.

29:29.850 --> 29:31.270
No, we're paying
over market value

29:31.270 --> 29:32.600
'cause your ex is a junkie!

29:32.600 --> 29:34.690
At least she was fun
to be around!

29:34.690 --> 29:36.770
Whoa!

29:36.770 --> 29:37.940
Okay.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.730
Duncan.

29:40.730 --> 29:42.610
Let's finish
this transaction,

29:42.610 --> 29:45.490
then you two can take your drama
and go away.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.410
I know you.

29:54.410 --> 29:56.750
No, I don't think so.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.420
Nah, y-you're an 828er.

30:02.460 --> 30:03.970
And you're a cop.

30:10.930 --> 30:14.930
You know, I gotta say, Zeke,
I'm disappointed.

30:14.930 --> 30:18.310
And I hope you know this means
I'm revoking your VIP status.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.110
It's okay.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.860
I don't like hanging out with
with guys who beat up women.

30:21.860 --> 30:24.780
I don't beat up women.

30:24.780 --> 30:26.780
I get my guys
to do that.

30:29.570 --> 30:32.870
But in this case,
I might make an exception.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.460
Duncan: Hey!

30:41.040 --> 30:42.920
NYPD.
Weapons down.

30:47.130 --> 30:48.260
You're a dead man.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.800
Yeah.
I already know that.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.850
Come on.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.810
Dr. Bahl, heard you had
an amazing catch

30:54.810 --> 30:56.600
with this
pediatric liver case.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.940
He's not out of the woods yet.
He needs a transplant.

30:58.940 --> 31:02.020
We are still waiting to see
if his parents are a match.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.520
Well, it's rare
that this disorder

31:03.520 --> 31:05.440
shows up in someone his age.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.940
He's lucky
you caught it.

31:06.940 --> 31:09.160
Orlena: Saanvi?

31:09.160 --> 31:10.570
How'd it go?

31:10.570 --> 31:12.330
I'm not a match.

31:12.330 --> 31:16.410
They said they'd put him on a
list, but that could take weeks.

31:16.410 --> 31:20.040
Then they started talking
about his odds, and I...

31:20.040 --> 31:21.960
We need to ask Finn.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.840
Okay, he has as much of a chance
of matching as you did.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.340
I know.
I will.

31:27.340 --> 31:31.260
I just can't imagine how,
after the way...

31:31.260 --> 31:34.310
Actually,
you might not have to.

31:43.770 --> 31:46.530
They say
I'm a perfect match.

31:48.190 --> 31:49.700
And you'll...?

31:49.700 --> 31:53.200
I told you I wanted
to give something to my son.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.620
Now I can.

31:57.330 --> 31:59.120
Part of my liver.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.500
I didn't need
the whole thing anyway.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.540
Don't worry.

32:04.540 --> 32:07.960
It'll be
an anonymous donation.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.300
You don't have to change
your life or Theo's.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.680
No.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.390
You're saving his life.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.890
You deserve
to be part of it.

32:23.020 --> 32:26.320
Thank you
for convincing him.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.070
I didn't need to.

32:28.070 --> 32:30.610
Finn agreed right away.

32:30.610 --> 32:32.490
He's a good guy.

32:35.870 --> 32:39.200
Nice shot.
I got winner.

32:39.200 --> 32:42.710
Eh...I don't know.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.960
I've done
a little digging.

32:49.340 --> 32:52.380
What are you
talking about?

32:52.380 --> 32:57.390
Turns out you were engaged
to an 828er.

32:57.390 --> 32:59.390
Michaela Stone?

32:59.390 --> 33:01.350
I'm onto you.

33:01.350 --> 33:03.190
Don't come back here.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.400
Stay away
from Tamara, too.

33:18.120 --> 33:21.080
Alright.
You want to know about me?

33:21.080 --> 33:24.500
How I ended up here?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.210
I'm happy to share.

33:28.630 --> 33:29.710
You're right.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.670
I do know
Michaela Stone.

33:33.670 --> 33:37.850
And, yeah, yeah,
we were gonna get married.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.970
Then she went to Jamaica.

33:39.970 --> 33:43.140
I swear to God
she died on that plane.

33:43.140 --> 33:46.650
Because 5 1/2 years later,
whoever came back,

33:46.650 --> 33:51.940
hell, whatever came back,
see, that wasn't her.

33:51.940 --> 33:55.150
This person destroyed
my marriage,

33:55.150 --> 33:57.280
and then she threw me
under the bus in open court

33:57.280 --> 34:00.910
to protect some drug addict
she barely knows.

34:00.910 --> 34:06.210
Which destroyed everything
that I have worked for.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.880
Yeah, Billy, you want to know
why I'm here?

34:09.880 --> 34:13.210
It's because Michaela Stone
destroyed my life.

34:13.210 --> 34:16.300
My entire life.

34:24.060 --> 34:26.850
Well, then let's get
another round.

34:43.660 --> 34:45.830
This changes everything.

34:45.830 --> 34:49.000
I mean, the possibility that
all of this has happened before,

34:49.000 --> 34:51.210
it's...

34:51.210 --> 34:53.340
it's huge.

34:53.340 --> 34:59.010
I am so impressed that you and
TJ managed to track it all down.

34:59.010 --> 35:01.970
So...

35:01.970 --> 35:05.930
TJ just said he
figured something else out

35:05.930 --> 35:09.480
about the tarot, so...

35:09.480 --> 35:11.270
can I go meet him?

35:13.190 --> 35:16.990
Dad, if you're worried that
I'm gonna go to the church

35:16.990 --> 35:22.200
and poison my impressionable
mind, I'm not.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.870
Okay?

35:23.870 --> 35:26.620
Please understand me.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.540
You know us.
Other people don't.

35:28.540 --> 35:32.920
They listen to Adrian calling us
immortals, that we're miracles,

35:32.920 --> 35:36.300
but what they hear
is we're not human.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.550
And that's incredibly dangerous
for all of us.

35:38.550 --> 35:43.430
I know, okay?
You've made that very clear.

35:43.430 --> 35:45.470
Can I go now?

35:51.980 --> 35:53.270
Yes.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.280
Don't worry.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.690
You can track my phone.

35:58.690 --> 36:02.370
Oh, I am.
And I'm tracking his, too.

36:02.370 --> 36:04.240
You're the worst.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.410
Love you.

36:10.580 --> 36:12.120
Courtney?

36:14.670 --> 36:16.670
She's gone.
How do you know?

36:16.670 --> 36:18.510
'Cause that's what
Courtney does --

36:18.510 --> 36:20.470
upends your life
and then disappears.

36:20.470 --> 36:23.260
Except maybe it's okay
because it looks like

36:23.260 --> 36:27.180
she decided to
"move into sober house."

36:27.180 --> 36:29.730
Do you think
she actually went?

36:29.730 --> 36:32.020
It's up to her.

36:32.020 --> 36:34.650
But I've made my amends.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.270
I can't live her life
for her.

36:37.270 --> 36:39.360
I can only live mine.

36:41.650 --> 36:43.820
And I really like
this life.

36:58.630 --> 37:00.970
I was thinking maybe...

37:00.970 --> 37:03.380
maybe we should
do the story.

37:03.380 --> 37:08.100
Grace, I thought we agreed to
keep the pregnancy to ourselves?

37:08.100 --> 37:09.810
I mean,
if the Xers found out, it...

37:09.810 --> 37:12.480
That's what I've
been thinking about.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.770
But then you told me
about Orlena.

37:15.770 --> 37:18.360
What does she
have to do with this?

37:20.110 --> 37:24.450
For five years, she convinced
people that her son Theo

37:24.450 --> 37:27.240
was her husband's
and not a passenger's.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.240
And so that got me thinking
maybe we could convince people

37:30.240 --> 37:33.910
that our baby girl
is not an 828 baby.

37:34.790 --> 37:38.420
I-I'm sorry.
W-What are you saying?

37:38.420 --> 37:40.750
We could...

37:40.750 --> 37:43.340
We could tell people
she's Danny's.

37:46.340 --> 37:49.930
What?
I'm sure Danny would
go along with it.

37:50.930 --> 37:54.270
Two different Callings
have warned us

37:54.270 --> 37:57.560
that the baby
might be in danger.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.270
I'm scared.

37:59.270 --> 38:01.860
I am, too.

38:01.860 --> 38:04.490
I'm terrified.

38:04.490 --> 38:06.700
It was just an idea.
I'm sorry.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.870
I will protect
our baby.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.740
We both will.

38:10.740 --> 38:12.450
Together.

38:17.830 --> 38:19.750
There you are.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.090
Are you okay?

38:22.090 --> 38:24.760
You were right.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.720
The tarot.

38:26.720 --> 38:30.430
What are you
talking about?

38:30.430 --> 38:32.470
The illuminated path.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.890
Just like the card said.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.440
It's glowing lava.

38:43.650 --> 38:45.530
Well, they're LEDs.

38:45.530 --> 38:48.530
The tarot was a little concerned
about burning down Central Park.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.030
But as it turns out,
just like Emo Drake here,

38:52.030 --> 38:54.750
I, too, am kind of a fan
of mandolin music.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.960
Oh?

38:55.960 --> 38:58.540
Are you sure
that's not a lute?

38:58.540 --> 39:00.210
I'm not.

39:00.210 --> 39:03.550
But, look,
the final card.

39:09.470 --> 39:13.680
It's a fancy
strawberry pie.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.430
The tarot could have been
a little bit more specific

39:16.430 --> 39:19.100
on the difference between
baking soda and powder.

39:19.100 --> 39:20.770
But it's what we got.

39:20.770 --> 39:23.650
♪ Watch it fall from the sky ♪

39:23.650 --> 39:27.610
Well...it's perfect.

39:27.610 --> 39:31.910
♪ Feel it soak through my flesh
and my blood ♪

39:32.780 --> 39:36.950
♪ Feel it burn in my eyes ♪

39:55.390 --> 39:57.520
Theoretically,
the genetic anomaly

39:57.520 --> 40:00.980
could transfer to Finn's son
by way of the organ transplant,

40:00.980 --> 40:03.110
meaning we may have
just saved this kid

40:03.110 --> 40:04.770
and cursed him at the same time.

40:08.320 --> 40:11.490
Ben, if you find this,
I know I promised,

40:11.490 --> 40:13.950
but I also know that there was
no other way.

40:13.950 --> 40:15.450
I have to test on myself.

40:15.450 --> 40:17.580
I have to save the passengers.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.520
Ash.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.670
Oh, my God.

41:47.670 --> 41:49.340
Is this
what happened to us?

41:49.340 --> 41:51.300
Ben, did we crash?

41:52.670 --> 41:56.050
These people,
they weren't on the plane.

41:56.050 --> 41:57.680
Some of them were.

42:05.350 --> 42:07.150
What the hell's
happening?
