WEBVTT

01:07.985 --> 01:09.285
Violence

01:15.225 --> 01:16.525
Tyranny

01:20.545 --> 01:21.845
intrigues

01:25.305 --> 01:26.605
influence

01:29.305 --> 01:31.425
after the death of
the bohemian king

01:32.025 --> 01:34.185
the holy Roman
emperor Charles iv

01:34.665 --> 01:37.425
everything changed for the worse

01:38.425 --> 01:40.425
the darkness began to spread

01:40.545 --> 01:43.425
while a large part of
"Europe" sank into chaos

01:48.665 --> 01:53.065
The continent was engulfed
in war, plague and famine

01:54.665 --> 01:58.625
the catholic church
also experienced chaos

01:59.025 --> 02:00.905
so, two popes were elected.

02:01.825 --> 02:03.025
One in Rome

02:03.265 --> 02:07.385
and another under the protection
of the king of France in avignon.

02:11.785 --> 02:16.665
Only the coronation of a new
emperor can restore the rule of law

02:19.545 --> 02:23.265
but Charles iv's eldest son,
the bohemian king wenceslas,

02:23.625 --> 02:26.825
the one chosen for that
purpose is mired in debt

02:29.025 --> 02:31.825
his coronation lies only
in Rome by the pope.

02:33.185 --> 02:36.505
And all those who supported
pope ii in France.

02:36.625 --> 02:41.505
They are now trying to prevent
his coronation at all costs

02:45.545 --> 02:50.065
inspired by the true
story of jan jijka.

03:10.625 --> 03:11.825
Forgive us...

03:14.665 --> 03:16.145
What we're about to do

03:24.105 --> 03:25.945
Italy, 1402 ad

03:26.065 --> 03:27.265
eight

03:29.425 --> 03:30.625
seven

03:33.225 --> 03:34.525
six left

03:34.865 --> 03:36.665
and against 2000 or more now

03:42.465 --> 03:44.465
We won't hold out
much longer, yan.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.405
Five now

07:15.265 --> 07:19.325
Wait until the last of my knights
are killed and then show up?

07:22.745 --> 07:24.045
You are alive

07:26.225 --> 07:27.925
are you crazy

07:30.385 --> 07:32.945
maybe next time, pay on time

07:33.785 --> 07:36.185
and we want grouchy
coins, not florentines

07:36.305 --> 07:38.165
when did you not receive
your wages from me?

07:38.185 --> 07:40.685
When did you not
have our protection?

07:43.105 --> 07:46.125
Jan, Prague is ten days away

07:46.505 --> 07:48.625
know the importance
of what I'm doing!

07:50.825 --> 07:54.305
If I don't get there on time,
everything will go wrong

07:56.865 --> 08:00.705
I want to know who sent
the killers to kill me

08:06.905 --> 08:08.105
Who sent you?

08:08.625 --> 08:10.065
Just kill me

08:10.625 --> 08:13.305
or... you can join us

08:17.825 --> 08:19.025
why

08:19.705 --> 08:23.945
you are the last like most
of us... and the luckiest one

08:29.265 --> 08:35.105
The lord we used had
a patched coat of arms

08:38.985 --> 08:41.784
Henry was the
master of rosenborg.

08:50.745 --> 08:54.185
I'm supposed to trust a guy
who just tried to kill me?

08:54.665 --> 08:55.745
Yes

09:25.185 --> 09:27.305
Death brings life

09:41.625 --> 09:44.905
Prague, kingdom of bohemia

09:59.025 --> 10:00.705
Lord "Rosenberg"

10:01.025 --> 10:04.665
if you don't lend that money
to my brother to go to Rome...

10:05.265 --> 10:08.465
You may find men
waiting at your doorstep

10:09.625 --> 10:10.825
king sigismund

10:10.945 --> 10:15.545
just because your half-brother
here gave you some power

10:15.665 --> 10:18.585
we won't let you act like
you do in your own kingdom

10:19.065 --> 10:20.065
this is not Hungary.

10:20.185 --> 10:21.865
Don't let me do anything!

10:23.865 --> 10:27.665
I'm just here to help
my brother get to Rome.

10:28.305 --> 10:31.225
Let the only true "papa" go

10:35.025 --> 10:38.505
winter is approaching, and within weeks,
its journey will become impossible

10:38.625 --> 10:41.545
there is a way to
ease your fears

10:43.665 --> 10:45.545
I only fear one thing

10:46.065 --> 10:47.825
if you get killed
during this trip

10:47.945 --> 10:50.265
we will not only lose
the money you ask for now

10:50.385 --> 10:53.065
but we will also lose the
huge sums you already owe us

10:53.185 --> 10:54.385
this won't happen

10:54.505 --> 10:57.225
god help our father
to cross Italy safely

10:57.705 --> 10:58.705
for the crown itself

10:58.825 --> 11:03.305
and god brought your great-grandfather
back across Italy in a bone box!

11:04.025 --> 11:07.985
Great-grandfather
didn't have this!

11:08.465 --> 11:14.425
I have a document of safe passage for
our king to be crowned emperor in Rome.

11:14.545 --> 11:19.385
This will ease your
fears, rosenborg.

11:25.745 --> 11:27.505
You look like you saw a ghost

11:39.745 --> 11:44.305
Girl... can you get us a drink?

11:46.305 --> 11:47.505
Water

11:48.225 --> 11:52.585
or would a fierce warrior like
yourself prefer something stronger?

11:52.905 --> 11:54.145
It's your worst, girl

11:59.905 --> 12:01.505
She can smell a real man

12:02.345 --> 12:04.225
I can smell one too, back off

12:05.745 --> 12:06.945
thanks

12:14.945 --> 12:17.985
No one seems happy about
sending the king to Rome.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.685
Lord who has to pay for it

12:19.745 --> 12:20.945
yes

12:26.945 --> 12:28.265
You must be very rich

12:28.385 --> 12:31.025
I can't spend all my money,
you might want to help

12:33.545 --> 12:35.161
perhaps she should lend
some of it to the king

12:35.185 --> 12:38.665
yes, no matter how
much the king will get

12:38.785 --> 12:41.625
no one who is poor or even outside
of that room will benefit from it

12:50.145 --> 12:52.505
Rosenborg, wait! You
can't simply leave

12:53.065 --> 12:56.705
I promised support if I brought
the safe transit document

12:58.145 --> 13:01.025
I promised it before
sigismund arrived.

13:01.345 --> 13:04.625
Before the looting begins and brings
our kingdom to the brink of civil war

13:05.345 --> 13:07.025
forget about money

13:14.145 --> 13:15.145
Thanks

13:15.265 --> 13:16.465
lady Catherine

13:16.745 --> 13:17.945
lord "borish"

13:18.425 --> 13:20.825
my dad has missed you
since your last visit

13:21.985 --> 13:24.225
if things continue like this...

13:27.425 --> 13:28.665
I may come more often

13:49.185 --> 13:50.385
"Jigka"

13:51.665 --> 13:54.225
- torak - it surprises
me to see you back home

13:55.145 --> 13:56.845
just order across the place

14:00.585 --> 14:02.605
are you still working
for sigismund?

14:02.785 --> 14:06.985
We're recruiting... to support
his brother's trip to Rome.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.025
Are you still generous?

14:09.145 --> 14:10.505
Even more my friend

14:10.625 --> 14:12.505
it's the best time to come back

14:12.945 --> 14:15.785
they are all kind and gentle

14:16.945 --> 14:18.345
almost as if they
were volunteering

14:19.145 --> 14:20.345
we'll think about it

14:20.905 --> 14:25.505
unless you work for me, think
about it in another kingdom

14:27.385 --> 14:29.705
remember, we are doing
the lord's work here!

14:33.305 --> 14:34.545
The lord's work!

14:57.505 --> 14:58.905
Stop it immediately!

15:00.545 --> 15:01.745
Henry, do something

15:03.185 --> 15:04.385
stop hurting him!

15:04.945 --> 15:07.465
Is there anyone else who doesn't
want to join the king's army?

15:08.065 --> 15:10.105
Every citizen should
be properly tried

15:10.225 --> 15:13.345
according to the decree of law
promulgated by emperor "Charles iv"

15:13.785 --> 15:14.985
he died

15:15.585 --> 15:17.545
sigismund is the new
judge and referee here

15:17.665 --> 15:19.585
do something, we
can't let them do this

15:23.505 --> 15:26.585
this is sigismund's recruiting
officer, I'll handle it

15:27.305 --> 15:29.065
but we may need
your father's help

15:29.905 --> 15:31.145
whatever it takes

15:42.185 --> 15:46.865
We concluded that
kidnapping is the only way

15:46.985 --> 15:49.585
to help rosenborg keep his word

15:51.385 --> 15:54.105
I'll give you a discount
for his kidnapping

15:54.225 --> 15:58.185
not him, but his
fiancée, Catherine.

16:01.465 --> 16:03.145
We don't kidnap women

16:03.785 --> 16:04.985
it's a good base

16:05.945 --> 16:09.265
but we are talking about
the king and his rules

16:10.825 --> 16:12.105
it doesn't make a difference

16:15.305 --> 16:18.865
if you still believe that things
can be changed for the better

16:20.665 --> 16:21.985
I need your help

16:24.425 --> 16:28.025
there is something you need
to know, but keep it a secret

16:29.465 --> 16:32.225
her uncle is the king of France.

17:01.265 --> 17:03.105
More wine for everyone!

17:03.745 --> 17:05.224
And let's drink a
toast, "havier."

17:06.345 --> 17:09.265
We will miss you brother,
he died a good death

17:11.305 --> 17:12.505
to the lord

17:33.665 --> 17:35.225
That's enough son,
one more, okay?

17:35.345 --> 17:36.545
Come on dad, I know

17:36.945 --> 17:38.145
fetch the bucket

17:45.425 --> 17:46.625
Both

17:51.105 --> 17:53.425
there is someone
upstairs, knight

17:53.945 --> 17:56.745
ask him if he can
help carry the buckets

17:56.865 --> 18:00.025
I'm not lying, it's coming down

18:04.865 --> 18:06.365
don't come close, yan.

18:19.785 --> 18:21.085
Brother

18:22.345 --> 18:23.645
brother

18:29.465 --> 18:32.001
Is it true then that you killed a
wild animal with your bare hands?

18:32.025 --> 18:34.265
Don't believe everything
people say about me

18:34.385 --> 18:35.385
I had a knife

18:35.505 --> 18:36.665
the wild animal was small

18:36.785 --> 18:37.985
and me too

18:38.545 --> 18:40.745
not much game left,
but there are...

18:40.865 --> 18:42.885
But they're still fighting
with your army in Italy?

18:43.345 --> 18:45.225
How many men did you kill there?

18:54.665 --> 18:56.165
Hello hello

18:57.345 --> 18:58.825
Barbara, Matthew...

19:01.145 --> 19:02.705
This is my brother yan.

19:05.065 --> 19:06.425
Nice to meet you sir

19:07.385 --> 19:09.145
your father talked
a lot about you

19:11.245 --> 19:13.025
- I'll be back later.
- Good night

19:13.045 --> 19:14.745
good night

19:15.545 --> 19:17.545
thank you, thank you, yuroslav.

19:18.745 --> 19:19.745
Your wife?

19:19.865 --> 19:22.745
No, my mom died of the
plague, they're mad

19:22.865 --> 19:24.385
shut up boy, it's time for bed

19:39.025 --> 19:41.145
My grandfather didn't
like anyone touching that

19:41.585 --> 19:42.785
I know

19:44.665 --> 19:47.585
I got it as a gift

19:48.225 --> 19:53.625
from emperor Charles
iv's imperial housekeeper

20:09.105 --> 20:12.625
This wild animal tusk will
make you fast and strong

20:22.345 --> 20:23.585
Did you come to kill someone?

20:24.545 --> 20:25.985
To your bed now!

20:34.465 --> 20:35.785
Did you come for it?

20:35.905 --> 20:37.105
Of course not

20:56.505 --> 20:57.705
No, right

21:03.105 --> 21:07.025
Need a new deck among others

21:07.745 --> 21:09.785
I can fix all of
truknov with this money

21:22.345 --> 21:25.065
My dad was proud of
you, you know that?

21:32.065 --> 21:33.185
You should have witnessed it

21:33.305 --> 21:35.625
you get 1000 for every one
of us who survives this

21:35.745 --> 21:37.425
a total of 3000 to share

21:37.905 --> 21:40.705
kidnapping a woman
may bring bad luck

21:41.465 --> 21:44.225
for 1000 grooves I am
glad to do it my friend

21:54.025 --> 21:55.545
Would you join me for mass

21:56.025 --> 21:58.905
and let people think
I support jan hus?

21:59.865 --> 22:01.065
If you attend mass

22:01.185 --> 22:03.985
you'll realize that's not
all that jan hus preaches.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.585
These people hate sigismund
as much as you hate him

22:06.705 --> 22:09.385
you know a lot of
them hate me too

22:09.705 --> 22:11.945
the enemy of my
enemy is my friend

22:12.065 --> 22:13.385
but support "yan hoss"

22:13.785 --> 22:17.185
who openly oppose the doctrine
of the catholic church...

22:17.305 --> 22:20.585
Yan advances the doctrine of Jesus
over the doctrine of the pope.

22:20.945 --> 22:23.105
This may be what the
church needs to unite

22:23.225 --> 22:24.665
obsession may be right

22:24.785 --> 22:28.945
until I know for
sure, I'll be outside

22:32.345 --> 22:34.705
blessed my lady, blessed my lord

22:34.825 --> 22:36.025
bless you

22:39.505 --> 22:40.505
I will pray for you

22:40.625 --> 22:41.825
not out loud please

22:43.465 --> 22:44.665
thanks

22:45.945 --> 22:49.505
while you're inside, pray that god will
forgive you for failing to kill borich.

22:52.545 --> 22:55.505
These kings and lords are
fighting each other...

22:55.525 --> 22:57.565
Hello lady Catherine
hello lady Catherine

22:57.585 --> 22:59.905
instead of not going
to war to survive

23:00.225 --> 23:04.265
look around, king sigismund
recruits our innocent brothers

23:04.385 --> 23:07.945
to create an army for the
coronation of wenceslas in Rome.

23:08.265 --> 23:13.345
But at the same time, he is plundering
our kingdom in the name of the lord

23:13.865 --> 23:18.305
is this how he imagines the path to
the unification of the holy church?

23:18.425 --> 23:21.465
Which babawan has now brought
to the brink of destruction?

23:21.585 --> 23:26.585
It was the ambition of those rulers
who thirst for power what tore it apart

23:26.705 --> 23:29.985
there is no place in their
hearts except for themselves

23:30.625 --> 23:33.425
these kings and lords
act like they...

23:33.545 --> 23:35.345
Madam, if you please

23:35.905 --> 23:38.145
the brothers want to talk to
you about your generous gift

23:38.225 --> 23:40.065
everyone is equal in his opinion

23:40.505 --> 23:44.185
be strong and spread the
word to your neighbors

23:44.545 --> 23:45.745
let's sing

23:46.345 --> 23:52.625
"you soldiers of the lord"

23:53.425 --> 23:57.985
"and his law"

23:59.585 --> 24:05.825
"pray to the lord to help you"

24:06.865 --> 24:12.385
"and they believed in him"

24:14.705 --> 24:17.665
forgive us, my god, for
what we are about to do

24:24.945 --> 24:26.145
Lady Catherine?

24:30.425 --> 24:31.625
Lady Catherine?

24:36.465 --> 24:38.425
Lady Catherine, is
everything okay inside?

24:39.945 --> 24:41.145
Madam

24:46.585 --> 24:48.505
- Open the door.
- Yes, sir

24:49.105 --> 24:51.185
stop, stop! What are you doing

24:51.305 --> 24:53.505
do you have the key
with you? Go get it

24:53.625 --> 24:54.761
- accompany him.
- Present, sir

24:54.785 --> 24:55.825
- come in.
- Yes, sir

24:55.945 --> 24:57.145
come on

25:02.465 --> 25:03.665
Silently

25:08.465 --> 25:09.665
move on!

25:13.345 --> 25:14.545
Shut the door!

25:23.865 --> 25:24.865
Shit!

25:25.185 --> 25:27.585
Come on! Come on! Search
those houses! Come on

25:41.745 --> 25:43.525
Did you enjoy the trip?

25:44.705 --> 25:47.425
Not really terrible, it
smelled like your feet

25:47.545 --> 25:48.745
my foot

25:51.065 --> 25:52.505
do you have any
idea what you did?

25:53.985 --> 25:57.865
And in a church? Do you not understand
that it is a house of worship?

25:57.985 --> 26:01.665
If my words meant anything,
I refused to enter her

26:01.785 --> 26:03.525
but you took the money, right?

26:19.625 --> 26:21.925
Do you think about
your fiancé's work?

26:24.425 --> 26:25.965
What would he have done?

26:44.985 --> 26:46.485
Open the gates!

26:50.540 --> 26:52.040
Open the gates!

26:55.250 --> 26:56.550
My god

27:05.290 --> 27:06.809
Search there

27:06.810 --> 27:08.310
nothing here!

27:27.240 --> 27:28.740
Lord "borish"

27:31.760 --> 27:35.040
he'll take her to your hunting
palace in the next few days

27:35.640 --> 27:39.400
good, then we don't have to
worry about money anymore

27:40.040 --> 27:43.920
maybe we should use more
of its political value

28:14.200 --> 28:16.680
I don't want anyone to know you

28:24.640 --> 28:26.480
My fiancé will take
it from your corpse

28:49.880 --> 28:51.240
I need you alive

28:52.280 --> 28:53.800
I don't feel cold

28:59.240 --> 29:00.820
It wouldn't surprise me...

29:41.280 --> 29:43.520
I assumed your brother
was behind this

29:44.960 --> 29:48.280
but your involvement
makes much more sense

29:48.400 --> 29:51.320
don't pay attention to what i'm
saying where you are, I'm here to help

29:51.440 --> 29:54.500
to help me, then you mean
he was already your brother?

29:57.400 --> 30:00.040
As soon as I bring back
your beautiful fiancée...

30:01.200 --> 30:05.680
I want to support your whole union of
nobles for any and all activities here

30:09.320 --> 30:13.960
you might even go so far as to Rob
your brother of the bohemian crown?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.400
He's my half-brother

30:16.840 --> 30:20.560
and don't look so shocked that you and your
nobles' union are already plotting to take it

30:21.240 --> 30:23.560
that's why you tried
to kill borich.

30:27.720 --> 30:30.200
But what about the business
I might lose with her father

30:30.520 --> 30:32.320
if I make a deal with you?

30:32.680 --> 30:34.360
You know how much he hates you

30:34.480 --> 30:37.680
if you were the king here, I
would give you much more than that

30:37.800 --> 30:41.880
and as you know, her family is the most
hater of my brother being crowned emperor

30:44.480 --> 30:45.720
most important of all

30:46.400 --> 30:49.360
if you don't find it by
this time, you won't find it

30:50.520 --> 30:52.800
why were you so confident
that you could find her?

30:53.240 --> 30:58.560
I don't need to find it, the
lord will hand it over to me

31:05.920 --> 31:09.080
It's so far away,
you're stronger than me

31:17.760 --> 31:18.960
Where is "yan"?

31:19.600 --> 31:20.800
At home maybe

31:26.200 --> 31:27.760
Do you see your goal? Yes

31:29.440 --> 31:30.640
do you understand the method?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.576
- It's like you let go of your arm.
- Yeah

31:37.600 --> 31:39.520
stand still, do you
understand the method?

31:41.040 --> 31:44.040
Hurry up, do it fast

31:44.160 --> 31:45.400
put your hand in the middle

31:47.960 --> 31:49.400
- do you see your target?
- Yes

31:56.160 --> 31:57.360
Do you see

31:59.200 --> 32:00.400
my father

32:02.960 --> 32:05.640
run away! Come on! Run away!

32:12.200 --> 32:14.240
I don't know if I'm going
to let him play with that

32:16.720 --> 32:17.960
do you see how dangerous it is?

32:19.360 --> 32:20.560
Leave it

32:22.720 --> 32:24.440
- leave him alone!
- Run!

32:25.440 --> 32:26.640
Leave it

32:28.800 --> 32:30.000
it's real jigka

32:33.440 --> 32:35.480
"yan"? Come here

32:45.440 --> 32:48.480
Look, it's truknov, we'll move!

33:02.960 --> 33:04.280
Search the houses!

33:52.600 --> 33:56.560
I know, you fought bravely

34:41.840 --> 34:43.040
Rosenborg?

34:45.000 --> 34:48.560
No, sigismund man, torak.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.880
Leave me alive to
send you a message

34:57.760 --> 35:00.960
your brother will be hanged
if you do not return to him

35:30.600 --> 35:32.240
Death brings life

35:38.120 --> 35:39.440
It does not make sense

35:39.560 --> 35:41.960
why would sigismund want
to steal it from our king?

35:43.240 --> 35:45.320
Maybe he just wants
the ransom for himself

35:46.040 --> 35:47.200
we can't barter it

35:47.320 --> 35:48.320
of course not

35:48.440 --> 35:50.560
we won't do this,
no girl, no money

35:51.640 --> 35:53.440
we don't leave our men behind

35:53.840 --> 35:54.960
it wasn't one of us

35:55.080 --> 35:56.440
help with the issue of caves

35:57.040 --> 35:58.960
toorak warned us not
to work in this area

35:59.640 --> 36:01.960
so even if we trade it, you
know he'll never let us go

36:02.080 --> 36:05.280
your brother will die
anyway... but by our side

36:09.560 --> 36:10.760
we need your help

36:14.840 --> 36:16.040
talk to the rebels

36:36.880 --> 36:38.216
You will receive
a generous reward

36:38.240 --> 36:39.680
you don't have to pay us

36:41.080 --> 36:43.800
yuroslav is a good
man, one of us

36:43.920 --> 36:45.720
this is an action,
not a rebellion

36:45.840 --> 36:47.040
not for us

36:47.440 --> 36:49.280
we are here to fight for justice

36:51.720 --> 36:54.520
to prevent her fiancé
from taking our land

36:56.240 --> 36:57.920
if we die without a son

36:58.520 --> 37:01.120
rosenborg transfers
our property law to him

37:05.240 --> 37:06.720
I'm here for my daughter

37:06.840 --> 37:11.040
I'm here to kill every rosenborg
soldier in southern bohemia.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.000
Then he killed him

37:15.400 --> 37:17.480
I need your help
to send a message

37:19.240 --> 37:20.440
where are your weapons?

37:21.920 --> 37:23.120
Over here

37:23.960 --> 37:26.000
we just killed
two rosenborg men.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.120
We welcome you here

37:46.840 --> 37:48.560
I promise to protect it

38:14.480 --> 38:15.780
Divine

38:16.760 --> 38:20.800
you know that my brother is too
weak to unite the holy church

38:20.920 --> 38:22.120
under the shadow of Rome

38:23.040 --> 38:24.320
this is my mission

38:25.600 --> 38:28.320
with your blessing,
I'll use Catherine.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.880
To prevent the French
king from blocking my way

38:32.000 --> 38:33.640
so that we can achieve our goal

38:39.200 --> 38:40.520
King sigismund

38:45.360 --> 38:48.320
the lord answered
your prayers again

38:50.080 --> 38:51.280
oh really

38:56.000 --> 38:58.400
tomorrow it will be yours

39:00.440 --> 39:01.640
what about "jigka"?

39:02.560 --> 39:05.560
We'll be ready
because I trained him

39:08.040 --> 39:09.240
but I'm better than him

39:23.920 --> 39:25.960
Back! Yes, again

39:26.080 --> 39:27.280
and one!

39:33.240 --> 39:34.480
Extend your hands

39:34.600 --> 39:35.800
thus

39:54.960 --> 39:57.280
I need a blacksmith
and big nails

40:08.000 --> 40:10.400
He first saw you
at jan hoss church.

40:11.600 --> 40:12.920
What were you doing there?

40:17.880 --> 40:19.880
He is the only one who
does not fear the church

40:22.080 --> 40:24.560
how does it distort what
the Bible actually says?

40:27.680 --> 40:29.720
There may be one or two
things we can agree on

40:47.120 --> 40:49.160
No one of your fiancé's
men liked my cooking

40:51.760 --> 40:53.400
something more
must have happened

40:56.880 --> 40:58.080
much more

41:01.760 --> 41:04.040
it doesn't compare to
what some have experienced

41:07.400 --> 41:09.640
nobody wants to be here

41:12.880 --> 41:14.600
but we can't stand it anymore

41:24.960 --> 41:26.160
Yan!

41:53.200 --> 41:54.200
Why are you running away?

41:54.320 --> 41:56.920
You can't trade me for sigismund
you don't know who he is

41:57.320 --> 41:58.680
it's good enough for your fiancé

41:58.800 --> 42:00.160
sigismund does this on his own!

42:00.280 --> 42:02.920
By saving me, he will force my
fiancé to carry out his orders

42:03.040 --> 42:04.160
I can't live with that!

42:04.280 --> 42:05.320
It is the will of the lord

42:05.400 --> 42:07.960
all because you believe that the
lord has set kings on the throne

42:08.280 --> 42:09.896
please tell me more about
the will of the lord

42:09.920 --> 42:11.220
tie it up

42:12.120 --> 42:13.960
your nephew died because of you

42:14.560 --> 42:15.800
is that the will of the lord?

42:20.480 --> 42:22.720
If you hadn't done this,
he'd still be alive!

42:44.880 --> 42:46.080
Remove it

43:01.840 --> 43:03.040
Let's move

43:11.480 --> 43:12.680
Come on

43:14.200 --> 43:15.880
let's go! Hurry up!

43:32.160 --> 43:34.840
You went too far by
talking about your nephew

43:36.320 --> 43:37.520
we have arrived

44:31.280 --> 44:34.280
You built yourself a real
army, right? I'm proud of you

44:35.520 --> 44:37.200
I'd rather be alone

44:43.040 --> 44:44.240
I warned you, didn't I?

44:46.080 --> 44:47.720
The little bastard
was originally a thief

44:48.720 --> 44:52.640
or did you give it to him
as a token of your love?

45:00.600 --> 45:02.200
Bring my old friend's brother

45:21.360 --> 45:22.560
I will never go with your king

45:23.240 --> 45:24.856
would you rather stay
with your kidnappers?

45:24.880 --> 45:26.080
Commander Martin...

45:26.520 --> 45:29.480
Did Rosenberg give you
permission to stab the boys?

45:30.160 --> 45:32.160
- Lady Catherine...
- I'm in charge here

45:32.800 --> 45:36.800
this is all in the name of the
church and to save you, my lady

45:38.520 --> 45:40.020
I am in charge now

45:40.640 --> 45:43.760
and if this beast approaches me,
you will lead your men against it

45:43.780 --> 45:45.100
lady Catherine, give us...

45:45.120 --> 45:47.200
You are no longer in your
kingdom with your sisters

45:47.960 --> 45:52.200
build your uncle's great
alliance your way, madam

46:28.720 --> 46:31.080
What did you do? I killed him!

46:31.200 --> 46:34.520
If my father was alive, he would
be ashamed of you being his son!

46:35.560 --> 46:36.760
Come here

47:00.360 --> 47:02.560
Turn around, we've arrived

47:41.000 --> 47:42.200
The door

48:17.680 --> 48:18.880
Can I drink a little of it?

48:21.280 --> 48:22.480
Both

48:23.000 --> 48:24.200
right now

48:33.400 --> 48:34.600
Hey archers!

48:46.240 --> 48:47.440
Aim your arrows!

48:56.860 --> 48:58.060
Right now

48:58.080 --> 48:59.620
shield! Lift it up!

49:18.360 --> 49:19.560
You cavalry!

49:20.600 --> 49:21.800
Attacks

49:36.280 --> 49:37.480
They fired!

49:38.400 --> 49:39.960
Wait! Attack!

49:55.400 --> 49:58.040
We need more rosenborg
soldiers, now!

50:03.360 --> 50:04.800
Come on! Run!

50:06.120 --> 50:07.320
Watch her!

50:26.720 --> 50:27.880
Back off!

50:28.000 --> 50:29.200
Pull out!

50:34.440 --> 50:37.880
What are you doing?
You cowards! Come back!

51:04.800 --> 51:06.400
Rosenborg's foot soldiers

51:07.280 --> 51:08.480
they attacked!

51:15.720 --> 51:20.120
"You soldiers of the lord"

51:20.240 --> 51:23.680
"and his law"

51:24.280 --> 51:28.760
"pray to the lord to help you"

51:28.880 --> 51:32.440
"and they believed in him"

51:32.560 --> 51:38.760
with him you will
always be victorious.

52:35.960 --> 52:38.160
- A lot?
- No, sir!

52:48.120 --> 52:50.000
The money is back in our pocket

52:50.120 --> 52:51.320
just go!

53:11.000 --> 53:13.120
From here, come on, come on

53:33.240 --> 53:34.480
It was an ambush

53:38.440 --> 53:39.440
what

53:39.560 --> 53:43.240
they got it back! I
know where they are!

54:07.560 --> 54:10.320
This is not a good way to die

54:19.280 --> 54:21.400
I am honored to
fight by your side

54:22.960 --> 54:24.960
I hope it's worth it

54:30.080 --> 54:32.160
Her uncle is the king of France.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.760
Jigka, what's the plan?

55:56.680 --> 55:57.880
Catch him!

56:39.400 --> 56:41.160
Come on from here

56:49.040 --> 56:50.240
- "Jigka!"
- there!

56:53.760 --> 56:54.960
Let's go

56:57.040 --> 56:59.760
yan! Yan!

57:07.080 --> 57:08.760
Up here!

57:10.720 --> 57:11.920
Yan!

57:29.520 --> 57:30.920
- We have to go back - we can't

57:34.560 --> 57:35.760
jigka!

57:48.440 --> 57:49.640
It's a dead end

59:14.360 --> 59:17.000
They chased smoke to
all the exits, okay?

59:19.600 --> 59:21.080
Give my dogs their stimulus

59:24.040 --> 59:26.960
torak slashed yan's head, we
need to go back and help him

59:27.080 --> 59:28.960
both! We follow his plan

59:29.080 --> 59:31.936
we are reorganizing our ranks at the
meeting point near the fishing palace

59:31.960 --> 59:33.960
this is all because
of his brother

59:34.640 --> 59:36.920
this is all because of you!

59:38.680 --> 59:41.640
They have our tracks, we
can keep them away from yan.

59:42.480 --> 59:43.800
But we have to leave now

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.400
Yan! Help me

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.560
both! "I

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.040
death brings life

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.480
death brings life

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.360
there must be a
reason for all of this

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.040
I "! "I

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.560
I

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.640
I

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.660
Follow your path

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.680
My mom gave me this ring

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.360
Before I lose it

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.200
Who is "Anna"?

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.400
You mentioned it
while you were asleep

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.360
Do not touch it

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.600
How long do you think it will be
before the water gets low enough?

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.780
I have to go home soon to
solve this whole matter

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.240
we have to wait a little longer

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.140
won't you let me go?

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.400
Saved your life

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.340
Ask god where we hide from
her father if they kill her

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.420
because of this failed animal

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.940
I would have done it differently

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.180
I'll just give your
brother what he wants

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.520
why are you breaking
our agreement?

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:45.300
This reduces the possibility of
her dying and me dying with her

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.820
not necessarily

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.400
get out of my way, animal!

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:59.000
If you change our agreement, I will
do whatever it takes to kill her

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:05.000
I will burn every tree I will burn every
man in the forest and I will kill them

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.920
even the king of
France will pursue you

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.160
forever

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.120
So... if you are not with
me, you are against the lord

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.240
did I mention that earlier?

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.260
Where is jigka?

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.080
Maybe we should
let the dogs play

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.500
no, please

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:47.319
Have you seen the woman?

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:48.899
Come on, more quickly

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.939
look, down there

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.260
Thanks for the shield

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.540
I'll need more pegs

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.140
Conrad is gone.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.500
Fucking

01:10:56.105 --> 01:10:57.985
This scent brings back memories

01:11:17.545 --> 01:11:22.945
Conrad, to what do
we owe this honor?

01:11:26.225 --> 01:11:28.545
They will deliver it to
the king's hunting palace

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:38.385
but I can lead you to where
they will regroup before that

01:11:40.825 --> 01:11:42.105
ten thousand grooves

01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:34.305
Have you experienced all this so many
times that you no longer feel a thing?

01:12:37.825 --> 01:12:38.865
Jan hus teaches us...

01:12:38.985 --> 01:12:42.705
I heard him preach, but
he never went to war

01:13:14.425 --> 01:13:15.705
What happened to Anna?

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:21.825
Gone

01:13:25.265 --> 01:13:26.905
I can see that you cared for her

01:13:33.905 --> 01:13:36.825
Those feelings may be the only
thing you know that is real

01:13:41.825 --> 01:13:44.625
if there is one thing
the lord has given us

01:13:47.385 --> 01:13:48.965
maybe that's all he gave us

01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:56.685
Did you love her

01:14:12.545 --> 01:14:14.085
I ask you for myself

01:14:17.105 --> 01:14:19.685
I'm not sure you can get
these feelings for me

01:14:24.905 --> 01:14:27.225
My father gave me the
freedom to follow my heart

01:14:30.025 --> 01:14:31.385
as much as he does
with his people

01:14:34.545 --> 01:14:41.385
but my mother felt that my
peers should not marry for love

01:14:46.825 --> 01:14:50.225
And if my sisters and I
had arranged marriages...

01:14:51.945 --> 01:14:53.905
It may serve the greater good

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:11.825
Because of you, jigka will come close
to handing her over to king wenceslas.

01:15:13.105 --> 01:15:14.385
Prepare the horses!

01:15:16.705 --> 01:15:17.905
Move

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:27.825
Drop it!

01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:32.505
Help!

01:15:33.105 --> 01:15:34.345
You must kill him, dad

01:15:34.465 --> 01:15:36.385
they enforce the laws, yan.

01:15:37.225 --> 01:15:38.665
The lord will not allow this

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:40.865
the blessings of the lord
are not in what he gives

01:15:40.985 --> 01:15:42.105
but in what he takes

01:15:42.225 --> 01:15:43.425
go get the rescue!

01:16:09.505 --> 01:16:10.705
Let's go

01:16:12.905 --> 01:16:14.105
god welling

01:16:24.025 --> 01:16:26.065
I'll give you time to step away

01:16:32.745 --> 01:16:36.265
Whoever paid to kill lord borich
was your fiancée, rosenborg.

01:16:40.905 --> 01:16:42.985
There are many qualities
in it that you do not know

01:16:52.425 --> 01:16:54.665
Well! Let's move on!
- Yes, sir!

01:16:54.785 --> 01:16:55.985
- Bring the horses!
- Let's go

01:17:19.785 --> 01:17:22.345
I won't let them take
advantage of me anymore

01:17:27.185 --> 01:17:28.385
it's my will

01:17:43.865 --> 01:17:47.785
Hunting palace

01:18:01.905 --> 01:18:04.945
Did you arrive? Or did
rosenborg arrive with our money?

01:18:05.705 --> 01:18:06.905
Both

01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:12.025
your brother is now helping
rosenborg to try to save her

01:18:12.825 --> 01:18:15.041
so my brother doesn't know that
we are behind the operation

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:16.265
you will send him a message

01:18:20.345 --> 01:18:21.545
known

01:18:23.345 --> 01:18:24.545
well

01:18:26.385 --> 01:18:28.905
we can always go
to Rome next spring

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:34.625
you have to unite the church,
you have to unite Europe.

01:18:35.425 --> 01:18:36.625
Right now

01:18:37.185 --> 01:18:39.905
tell me, do you
want to be emperor?

01:18:47.145 --> 01:18:50.345
What can we do to make sure
Catherine runs away from my brother?

01:18:51.225 --> 01:18:54.465
Pray for them and for me

01:19:36.865 --> 01:19:39.425
This behavior should
be punished mercilessly

01:19:40.265 --> 01:19:44.225
according to the laws enacted by emperor
"Charles iv" the outstretched hand of god

01:19:45.345 --> 01:19:47.385
by order of lord rosenborg.

01:19:47.785 --> 01:19:49.385
I sentence you to
hanging for treason

01:19:49.505 --> 01:19:50.705
both

01:19:51.465 --> 01:19:52.945
I let him go, he did nothing

01:19:56.145 --> 01:19:57.345
we have to do something

01:19:57.505 --> 01:19:58.705
their number is very large

01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:02.905
please, sir, just
tell us what I've done

01:20:03.185 --> 01:20:04.185
we will punish him

01:20:04.305 --> 01:20:06.225
help this fucking "jigka"!

01:20:06.585 --> 01:20:07.905
How do you live with this?

01:20:09.425 --> 01:20:10.625
Hang him!

01:20:17.745 --> 01:20:18.985
Both! Stop

01:20:20.345 --> 01:20:22.105
no, David! Both

01:20:27.505 --> 01:20:31.585
Stop! Stop it!

01:20:32.385 --> 01:20:33.585
Lady Catherine?

01:20:34.505 --> 01:20:39.145
Download it now!
Download it now! Stop!

01:20:39.265 --> 01:20:40.425
Put it down!

01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:41.905
Get your hands off
her, you idiot!

01:20:42.025 --> 01:20:45.025
Put it down! Put
it down, you idiot!

01:20:46.105 --> 01:20:51.705
Both! Stop! Put
it down! Right now

01:21:04.705 --> 01:21:05.905
"David"

01:21:15.625 --> 01:21:16.825
David!

01:22:04.985 --> 01:22:06.185
They found it

01:22:18.905 --> 01:22:21.945
You can take it,
but let go, jigka.

01:22:22.065 --> 01:22:24.065
Yes, you better back off!

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.805
Otherwise, all of
you will die here

01:22:25.825 --> 01:22:27.125
I let it go

01:22:27.205 --> 01:22:28.565
- yeah - let him go!

01:22:33.585 --> 01:22:34.885
Back off!

01:24:01.945 --> 01:24:04.465
We can still catch them,
it's not far away...

01:25:01.145 --> 01:25:02.845
Are you well

01:25:04.905 --> 01:25:06.205
I do not know

01:25:16.825 --> 01:25:19.745
Probably the first thing I
ever did that really changed me

01:25:45.945 --> 01:25:47.745
He killed ten men to save me

01:25:48.305 --> 01:25:51.225
which? She killed
the leader herself

01:25:52.345 --> 01:25:55.065
jijka... a lot of
people are joining us

01:25:55.185 --> 01:25:56.745
we no longer need to run away

01:25:58.305 --> 01:26:00.225
we will help you to take
Catherine to the king

01:26:06.785 --> 01:26:08.585
I'll take Catherine
to her father

01:26:12.465 --> 01:26:13.665
her dad

01:26:17.025 --> 01:26:19.545
it's our only chance
against rosenborg here

01:26:20.065 --> 01:26:24.625
when he hears what happened, he'll do more
harm to rosenborg than you can ever do

01:26:31.945 --> 01:26:33.145
Let's go

01:26:42.545 --> 01:26:44.025
We have to take
her to the palace

01:26:44.045 --> 01:26:45.485
her father is in France.

01:26:45.505 --> 01:26:47.025
We can get paid here tomorrow

01:26:47.045 --> 01:26:48.485
her father will pay,
you can take my share

01:26:48.505 --> 01:26:49.705
it's a waste

01:26:49.725 --> 01:26:51.065
toorak has ten more
days to find us

01:26:51.085 --> 01:26:52.425
it's an order!

01:26:58.905 --> 01:27:00.205
Come on

01:27:12.585 --> 01:27:14.625
Are you really going
to oppose your king?

01:27:17.545 --> 01:27:19.345
Do you remember what we learned?

01:27:22.105 --> 01:27:23.345
My dad was wrong

01:27:35.985 --> 01:27:39.585
You look like you might stay

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:42.745
your hospitality made
me think about it

01:27:42.865 --> 01:27:45.265
but please, no more is necessary

01:27:45.745 --> 01:27:49.385
how can you help
rosenborg against us?

01:27:50.145 --> 01:27:51.445
Against you?

01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:56.230
I thought his help would
make him grateful to us

01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:58.790
he will give you
the money you need

01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:03.750
I wouldn't have imagined that you
would be involved in something similar

01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:10.390
I suppose now that you
know, you'll back off

01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:28.590
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised to see you

01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:36.550
I need any soldier you can provide to
help your mercenaries bring them in

01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:39.990
and if you do, I will
support your journey to Rome.

01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:50.390
For all this extra hassle, we
also want you to lower your taxes

01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:52.550
imposed on people in your area

01:28:57.670 --> 01:29:00.190
How many times did my
dear brother tell me

01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.110
god will always
find a way for us?

01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:33.670
Why are you doing this

01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:44.070
When I was young, all I wanted
was to be a knight to the king

01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:51.110
I trained in the woods,
I trained... hard

01:29:55.870 --> 01:30:03.470
then one day the knights of king Anna
were hanged because she killed a falcon

01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:12.110
I tried to stop them, but...

01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:24.630
My father made me understand that
what happened was the right thing

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:28.590
because the king's law
is the law of the lord

01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:40.390
Perhaps the lord chose the kings

01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:44.630
but they still
make human mistakes

01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:24.950
Stop! Both

01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:29.070
stop

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:30.950
both

01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:42.470
Yan!

01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:45.150
France is too far away

01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:10.230
I will go on faithfully in the duties
entrusted to me when I was born

01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:14.270
I will work relentlessly against
all those who work against us

01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:18.350
until our work is done
here, the world may be mine

01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:22.870
but the power and glory
be yours for ever and ever

01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:27.750
thank god for helping
me make this happen

01:33:59.230 --> 01:34:00.630
You will never
get away with this

01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:03.270
rosenborg and I
already made a deal

01:34:05.150 --> 01:34:10.550
it was just to convince you to empty
your mansion so I could come and...

01:34:11.670 --> 01:34:12.870
Took him

01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:17.590
and in return for my help, he will
give me lord Henry Rosenberg's support.

01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:23.150
Not only your crown but... maybe
the emperor's crown as well

01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:25.630
I don't remember
anything about that

01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:27.150
did I forget to mention that?

01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:29.030
How distracted am I?

01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:46.990
Jigka!

01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:52.510
Jigka!

01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:53.830
I am here

01:34:55.785 --> 01:34:57.665
lord borich is looking for you

01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:01.185
he was assaulted in the hunting
palace but his commander took him out

01:35:15.745 --> 01:35:16.945
"Jigka"

01:35:24.745 --> 01:35:25.945
Where is Catherine?

01:35:26.905 --> 01:35:28.705
Heading to the
palace with my men

01:35:30.265 --> 01:35:33.545
sigismund has taken
over... the palace

01:35:36.705 --> 01:35:39.345
he can't be allowed
to take Catherine.

01:35:54.745 --> 01:35:56.785
He can't be allowed to take it

01:35:58.905 --> 01:36:01.145
that will be the
end of the kingdom

01:36:08.225 --> 01:36:12.905
When even those who rule
descend to this level

01:36:14.545 --> 01:36:17.585
it is not possible
to change anything

01:36:24.305 --> 01:36:29.985
And when I think I
neglected these people

01:36:32.185 --> 01:36:36.105
there is a way... for you

01:36:37.585 --> 01:36:39.185
to all of you

01:37:29.505 --> 01:37:35.345
If you choose to
fight, you may die

01:37:37.745 --> 01:37:39.345
but for your cause!

01:37:42.305 --> 01:37:45.465
And that's a good dead!

01:37:55.985 --> 01:37:57.825
I already lost a lot

01:37:59.465 --> 01:38:01.705
please, stay here

01:38:08.305 --> 01:38:11.025
David, get more help
from other towns

01:38:54.905 --> 01:38:56.285
Your compensation

01:39:04.025 --> 01:39:05.325
"Catherine"

01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:10.205
where is lord borich?

01:39:11.425 --> 01:39:12.925
Hunting with the king

01:39:20.505 --> 01:39:21.805
"Catherine"

01:39:22.465 --> 01:39:24.205
aren't you so worried?

01:39:36.185 --> 01:39:37.885
Do it again!

01:39:46.425 --> 01:39:47.925
Don't shoot arrows!

01:39:48.345 --> 01:39:50.085
Show us another way out

01:39:50.865 --> 01:39:52.165
from here

01:39:54.205 --> 01:39:55.705
go get it!

01:39:55.785 --> 01:39:57.645
Go get it, you idiots!

01:40:11.625 --> 01:40:13.165
Protect this door!

01:40:33.865 --> 01:40:35.165
Back off!

01:40:35.785 --> 01:40:37.905
As soon as we go out with
the money, it becomes yours

01:40:39.185 --> 01:40:40.385
"Freddy"

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:46.305
cover

01:41:06.465 --> 01:41:07.665
Let's go

01:41:24.625 --> 01:41:25.825
Don't move

01:42:25.865 --> 01:42:28.385
Get me out! Both! Both

01:42:45.465 --> 01:42:46.665
Jigka!

01:42:48.145 --> 01:42:49.345
It's mine

01:42:54.745 --> 01:42:55.945
Jigka!

01:43:28.625 --> 01:43:30.425
Both! "Jigka"!

01:43:33.305 --> 01:43:34.505
Jigka!

01:44:02.785 --> 01:44:03.985
Both

01:45:46.025 --> 01:45:47.825
Look at me! Look at me

01:45:52.425 --> 01:45:53.625
no rules

01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:00.745
you are the last,
come and work for me

01:46:15.585 --> 01:46:17.985
- As you wish - you will
kill him for no reason

01:46:27.025 --> 01:46:28.225
Death brings life

01:46:29.385 --> 01:46:30.385
both

01:46:30.505 --> 01:46:31.705
both

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.185
both

01:47:26.945 --> 01:47:30.305
Do you understand
what you did to me?

01:47:54.465 --> 01:47:55.785
I got you out

01:47:58.825 --> 01:48:00.025
you'll be fine

01:48:17.185 --> 01:48:18.585
Better than ever

01:48:21.665 --> 01:48:23.505
because now I know
what it feels like

01:50:27.105 --> 01:50:33.945
"You soldiers of the lord"

01:50:34.505 --> 01:50:40.025
"and his law"

01:50:40.625 --> 01:50:47.465
"pray to the lord to help you"

01:50:48.945 --> 01:50:55.385
"and they believed in him"

01:50:58.305 --> 01:51:05.945
"you soldiers of the lord"

01:51:07.785 --> 01:51:12.985
"and his law"

01:51:15.185 --> 01:51:21.985
"pray to the lord to help you"

01:51:24.665 --> 01:51:30.665
"and they believed in him"

01:51:41.265 --> 01:51:46.225
After the death of his brother,
sigismund became king of bohemia.

01:51:46.345 --> 01:51:50.385
But the people
revolted against him

01:51:51.745 --> 01:51:54.185
when sigismund
called them heretics

01:51:54.305 --> 01:51:56.201
and organized the "Europe"
crusade campaigns against them

01:51:56.225 --> 01:51:59.785
jan jigka led the
far fewer peasants

01:52:20.505 --> 01:52:21.705
Honour

01:52:29.625 --> 01:52:30.825
Justice

01:52:37.065 --> 01:52:38.265
Freedom

01:52:46.065 --> 01:52:47.265
Faith

01:52:58.665 --> 01:52:59.865
Hope

01:53:10.945 --> 01:53:15.265
God, forgive us for
what we're about to do

01:53:19.945 --> 01:53:22.705
jan jijka is one of the
greatest military leaders

01:53:22.825 --> 01:53:25.505
and the creators of all ages

01:53:27.665 --> 01:53:31.825
never knew defeat

01:53:35.545 --> 01:53:40.145
dedicated to all who
fight for freedom
