Where are you going so early?

04:56.378 --> 04:59.189
Don't record any more
messages on my alarm clock.

04:59.256 --> 05:01.024
Why not?

05:01.091 --> 05:03.777
I'll start to think we're
married or something.

05:03.844 --> 05:05.695
Don't ever say that word.

05:05.762 --> 05:10.283
I'll never bring you chicken soup
and fuck your brains out again.

05:10.767 --> 05:16.164
- How's your cold?
- Still there. How about yours?

05:16.231 --> 05:20.210
- You definitely took my mind off it.
- Really?

05:21.027 --> 05:23.379
Yes!

05:30.286 --> 05:32.430
Juliana here.

05:32.497 --> 05:36.226
Hi, Rayna. I missed my
audition, I lost my head!

05:36.292 --> 05:38.269
Listen, I have to go.

05:38.336 --> 05:40.396
I'm with David.

05:44.175 --> 05:49.697
Help yourself to whatever you want.
Set the alarm before you go. And...

05:51.849 --> 05:53.659
You are the greatest.

05:54.394 --> 05:58.706
- Bye, honey!
- Bye, honey. I'll call you later.

05:58.773 --> 06:00.166
When?

06:01.192 --> 06:03.586
- When?
- Soon!

06:26.842 --> 06:28.986
<i>I know you say</i>

06:29.887 --> 06:31.906
<i>Maybe some day</i>

06:32.890 --> 06:36.952
<i>I need never be alone</i>

06:38.896 --> 06:41.957
<i>I know I say</i>

06:42.024 --> 06:44.794
<i>It's the right way</i>

06:45.444 --> 06:48.464
<i>But you'll never be the one...</i>

06:48.531 --> 06:50.508
Did you reserve the court?

06:50.574 --> 06:54.303
Easy. I can't handle heavy
conversation at this ungodly hour.

06:54.370 --> 06:58.599
Sorry to do this early.
I've got to be done by 10:00.

06:58.666 --> 07:01.435
'You're not going to
make the 8:45, are you?

07:01.502 --> 07:03.103
How did you find me?

07:03.170 --> 07:06.065
'You have to check the
colours for the new issue. '

07:06.131 --> 07:10.861
- What are the colours?
- 'Yellow and red, or the traditional white. '

07:11.387 --> 07:14.448
- Got to think about it.
- 'David, please. '

07:14.515 --> 07:17.159
'Don't be late for the 10
o' clock with the board. '

07:17.226 --> 07:21.538
Don't tell anybody where I am. I
don't care if God calls. I'm very busy.

07:27.361 --> 07:30.547
- Can't you get rid of that board?
- The Seven Dwarfs?

07:30.614 --> 07:32.466
They drive you nuts.

07:32.533 --> 07:35.802
That was the desire of
my father who hired them.

07:38.539 --> 07:41.808
You fucked Julie Gianni
again, didn't you?

07:41.875 --> 07:46.438
I know someone was there when
I called. You had that tone.

07:46.505 --> 07:50.692
"Oh, no, man. I've got a
cold. I'm hanging in today. "

07:50.759 --> 07:53.028
I had a cold.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.072
- I was alone.
- Fine.

07:56.139 --> 07:58.700
You can do what you want with your life,

07:58.767 --> 08:01.328
but one day you'll
know what love truly is.

08:01.395 --> 08:03.580
It's the sour and the sweet.

08:03.647 --> 08:07.250
I know sour, which allows
me to appreciate the sweet.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.879
Julie Gianni is a friend.

08:10.946 --> 08:13.381
Sometimes we sleep together.

08:15.158 --> 08:17.677
What? What?

08:17.744 --> 08:21.765
My dream girl, Julie Gianni,

08:22.457 --> 08:25.477
is your fuck buddy!

08:26.127 --> 08:28.980
- What do you want to listen to?
- Slow down.

08:29.047 --> 08:31.775
What have we got here? Barcelona...

08:32.884 --> 08:34.193
Radiohead?

08:34.260 --> 08:35.778
Look out!

08:37.347 --> 08:38.490
Fuck!

08:42.102 --> 08:43.912
Fuck!

08:47.440 --> 08:49.125
We almost died.

08:49.192 --> 08:53.421
I know. My own death was
right there in front of me.

08:53.488 --> 08:56.966
You know what happened? Your
life flashed before my eyes.

08:57.033 --> 08:59.761
- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.

09:01.371 --> 09:04.098
We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.

09:04.165 --> 09:06.476
- Morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

09:06.542 --> 09:09.479
- Eaten anything yet?
- No.

09:09.962 --> 09:12.315
David, you were playing racquetball.

09:12.382 --> 09:16.944
I've been covering you for an hour
and you're playing racquetball.

09:17.011 --> 09:18.946
We are exiting the elevator.

09:19.013 --> 09:20.740
The board is not happy.

09:20.807 --> 09:22.325
Hello, David.

09:22.391 --> 09:25.828
You're in "The Post". Courtney Love
called to see if you got her e-mail

09:25.895 --> 09:29.582
and Graydon Carter called to see
if you're still on for dinner.

09:29.649 --> 09:34.295
The art department still need the decision
on the colours for the bikini issue.

09:34.362 --> 09:37.131
Did I mention the board
is pissed? You're late.

09:38.491 --> 09:40.718
David, hold up! Choose one!

09:40.785 --> 09:43.262
Wait! This one? David!

09:43.329 --> 09:45.765
They're all waiting for you.

09:45.831 --> 09:49.101
- You changed your hair.
- Yes, and David...

09:49.168 --> 09:52.354
...opinions are expected.

09:58.177 --> 09:59.862
David.

10:00.137 --> 10:04.575
Do you dream about the board,
the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?

10:04.642 --> 10:07.870
Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy,

10:07.937 --> 10:13.625
Happy, Doc, Dopey
and, of course, Grumpy.

10:13.692 --> 10:17.212
- How was Aspen?
- Good.

10:17.279 --> 10:20.841
Now, I want answers and I want them now.

10:28.082 --> 10:29.766
How's it going?

10:29.833 --> 10:33.478
'They still look at me as
if I was 11 years old. '

10:33.545 --> 10:36.940
He's going to inherit
everything. He gets it all.

10:38.550 --> 10:42.654
- Are you scared of your dreams?
- It's a nightmare either way.

10:42.721 --> 10:45.324
Is that how you explain
what's happened to you?

10:45.390 --> 10:47.617
What happened to your face?

10:47.684 --> 10:51.455
- I'm not talking to you any more.
- You don't want to show me your face?

10:51.521 --> 10:53.248
No!

10:56.652 --> 11:00.046
- Do you know why you're here?
- The conversation, the coffee...

11:00.113 --> 11:02.966
David, the part where we parry and joust

11:03.033 --> 11:07.596
and get to know each other
bit by bit... No can do.

11:07.662 --> 11:12.058
We'll have to skip that because
you've been charged with murder.

11:12.125 --> 11:16.688
In four weeks, a judge will determine
your fate based on what I write.

11:16.755 --> 11:20.650
- So you will talk to me.
- There is no murder.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.779
There is no murder!

11:25.013 --> 11:27.490
It never happened.

11:28.266 --> 11:31.327
I don't have to talk to anybody!

11:31.394 --> 11:34.038
- Want me to help?
- Get away from me.

11:34.105 --> 11:36.750
Easy, Face! Your whole
story's full of holes!

11:36.816 --> 11:41.754
Stop. Stop! Please leave right
now. I'll take responsibility.

11:41.821 --> 11:45.300
Please leave right
now. He's got control.

11:45.450 --> 11:48.720
I'm going to get you,
daddy's boy, little freak!

11:48.787 --> 11:52.056
- My parents are dead, you fuck!
- Enough!

11:53.833 --> 11:56.561
- Is that true?
- Good cop, bad cop.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.147
That you're a daddy's boy?

11:59.756 --> 12:02.775
Primer on David Aames, Senior.

12:02.842 --> 12:05.778
'My father wasn't built
for the 21st century. '

12:05.845 --> 12:09.657
He never went to McDonalds.
He never watched television,

12:09.724 --> 12:13.536
yet his biggest magazine
is still the "TV Digest".

12:13.603 --> 12:17.165
'He and my mother threw the grandest
parties of the literary world.

12:17.231 --> 12:20.668
'Ballooned, jumped out of
aeroplanes. He sought adventure. '

12:20.735 --> 12:23.129
His autobiography is the manual

12:23.196 --> 12:25.631
for every cut-throat
publisher in New York.

12:25.698 --> 12:28.301
It's called "Defending The Kingdom".

12:28.367 --> 12:31.596
Terminar com essa gentileza do Paul
McCartney. I've read it. Page 127:

12:32.246 --> 12:35.349
"David Junior was a
delight as a child. "

12:35.416 --> 12:39.061
Did I miss something here? Is
that all he wrote about you?

12:39.295 --> 12:42.481
I don't think he ever got over the fact

12:43.341 --> 12:48.571
that I'm absolutely
terrified of heights.

12:49.388 --> 12:51.574
The irony continues.

12:52.433 --> 12:55.911
When he and my mother were
run over by a drunken teenager

12:55.978 --> 12:59.039
on New Year's Eve, ten years ago,

12:59.106 --> 13:02.668
he left the keys to the kingdom...

13:03.569 --> 13:05.004
...to me.

13:09.533 --> 13:13.887
Who all thought they were first in line.

13:13.954 --> 13:17.224
And you believe the
board, the Seven Dwarfs,

13:17.291 --> 13:20.686
put you here to take
control of your company?

13:23.088 --> 13:26.817
- What do you care?
- We're just talking.

13:28.218 --> 13:30.237
Tonight's Wednesday night.

13:30.304 --> 13:34.074
I go out for dinner with my
two daughters on Wednesday,

13:34.141 --> 13:36.285
so I'll have to leave soon.

13:36.351 --> 13:39.413
You understand that our
time is limited, don't you?

13:42.691 --> 13:44.876
If I talk...

13:45.068 --> 13:47.671
you'll just think I'm crazy.

13:58.999 --> 14:02.602
With all the possible
respect I can offer a man

14:02.669 --> 14:07.023
wearing a latex mask and spouting
conspiracy theories, David...

14:07.632 --> 14:10.360
...believe me. You've
crossed that bridge.

14:11.386 --> 14:13.238
Enjoy your dinner.

14:15.432 --> 14:19.452
There are five basic
emotions in life, David.

14:21.021 --> 14:26.334
Tell me, what emotion gripped
him before he entered that cell?

14:27.277 --> 14:30.338
Was it guilt? Hate?

14:32.657 --> 14:34.551
Shame?

14:36.536 --> 14:37.804
Revenge?

14:45.587 --> 14:46.813
Love?

14:47.839 --> 14:50.441
I'm completely on the
wrong track, aren't I?

14:56.264 --> 14:58.199
Who needs ice?

14:59.767 --> 15:02.578
- Hey, Emma!
- David, happy birthday.

15:02.687 --> 15:06.040
You have got the greatest
taste in shoes bar none.

15:06.107 --> 15:07.959
Emma, have you met Lynette?

15:08.026 --> 15:11.796
No, but I shudder to think
what we might have in common.

15:11.863 --> 15:14.382
Did you invite the
entire snowboarding team?

15:14.449 --> 15:15.883
It is my birthday.

15:15.950 --> 15:18.636
- Say happy birthday to David.
- Happy birthday.

15:21.706 --> 15:23.766
Welcome to Graceland.

15:27.628 --> 15:29.564
Happy birthday, you sonofabitch!

15:30.131 --> 15:32.191
Happy birthday!

15:33.384 --> 15:35.069
Friends of me!

15:35.136 --> 15:37.280
Let the fun ensue.

15:39.515 --> 15:44.036
...the great John Coltrane.
They would love an article on it.

15:44.103 --> 15:46.956
It's an amazing, amazing product.

15:48.774 --> 15:51.293
No, that's OK. I've got it.

15:56.032 --> 15:58.884
- Literary god, Brian Shelby.
- Happy birthday!

15:58.951 --> 16:03.514
- And all the usual shit. How you doing?
- Living the dream, baby.

16:03.581 --> 16:05.432
David Aames.

16:05.499 --> 16:08.769
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- The pleasure of Sofia Serrano.

16:08.836 --> 16:11.480
We met today at the library.

16:11.547 --> 16:15.567
- My coat's too big for your closet.
- We were pretending to be intellectuals.

16:15.634 --> 16:19.989
- It's amazing. I love your coat.
- I overdressed. I mean, I underdressed.

16:20.055 --> 16:22.491
I'll continue like you're
both listening to me.

16:22.558 --> 16:27.162
- Do you have another room to put it in?
- I have ceased to exist.

16:27.229 --> 16:30.416
Madison Square Garden is
nearby. It might fit there.

16:31.442 --> 16:34.628
- Happy birthday.
- We picked it out together.

16:34.695 --> 16:37.840
- Thank you.
- We picked it out together. We.

16:37.906 --> 16:39.883
You're welcome.

16:41.618 --> 16:44.054
Stop flirting and open it.

16:46.665 --> 16:48.475
- Let's get a drink!
- Yes.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.894
I'll leave this upstairs.

17:08.979 --> 17:10.622
- Listen...
- Hey, Tommy.

17:10.689 --> 17:12.415
Don't blow me off.

17:12.482 --> 17:16.461
I'm all packed, I'm going back
to London and I understand.

17:16.528 --> 17:19.964
You put me up for that attorney's
job so you didn't have to fire me.

17:20.031 --> 17:23.260
A classy move. Your father
would have done the same.

17:23.326 --> 17:27.097
- It's OK, Tommy.
- I became incompetent.

17:27.164 --> 17:31.559
Is there anything more
unbecoming than an ageing mascot?

17:32.294 --> 17:36.564
I cared for your father. I
lived and breathed for him.

17:36.631 --> 17:39.150
These guys, the Seven Dwarfs,

17:39.217 --> 17:43.113
they think you're stupid.
A corporate hazard, a rogue.

17:43.179 --> 17:45.782
They'll find a way to
catch you out, David.

17:45.849 --> 17:50.662
They're lined up for your
office, your life, your position.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.254
And they're going to sell
this tradition of words

17:59.320 --> 18:02.423
so they can eat in a better cafeteria.

18:03.283 --> 18:07.804
What they don't know is
this. People will read again!

18:07.871 --> 18:09.472
Yeah.

18:10.748 --> 18:12.183
I got it.

18:12.250 --> 18:16.437
They've even got a nickname
for you behind your back.

18:17.672 --> 18:20.650
Citizen... Dildo.

18:22.010 --> 18:26.614
You've got great instincts, but
I say this with complete love.

18:27.140 --> 18:31.577
Claim your life. Learn
to be an asshole...

18:31.644 --> 18:35.873
- Two's enough.
- Forgive me.

18:37.358 --> 18:42.505
I still believe in this family,
David, even if it's only you.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.633
Drive Tipp home.

18:49.704 --> 18:52.765
Give him that big office
across from the Seven Dwarfs.

18:52.832 --> 18:57.186
Set up a meeting with the other
attorneys. I'll be in early tomorrow.

18:57.253 --> 18:59.772
Earlier than usual.

19:11.225 --> 19:13.077
Hello, handsome.

19:15.062 --> 19:17.915
- I've come to wish you happy birthday.
- Oh, man!

19:20.276 --> 19:24.046
- I didn't invite you, Julie.
- That was a little weird.

19:24.113 --> 19:28.050
That's how it works with
parties. You have to be invited.

19:28.117 --> 19:29.718
Oh.

19:31.287 --> 19:33.847
I'm mad at you, you dick.

19:34.331 --> 19:36.892
We made love four times the other night.

19:38.335 --> 19:41.313
- Was that good?
- Two's good.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.858
Three... is very good.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.778
- But four...
- Four's pretty good?

19:47.845 --> 19:50.072
Four is...

19:54.852 --> 19:57.037
Four is what?

19:58.355 --> 20:04.002
Hold me, I'll leave and you can go
back and talk to that cute brunette.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.587
Four is what?

20:05.654 --> 20:09.716
I don't want to meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.

20:11.034 --> 20:13.011
Four is what?

20:13.495 --> 20:15.680
She looks like a moth, David.

20:17.207 --> 20:20.393
- A moth?
- Sometimes I worry about you.

20:20.460 --> 20:25.774
Some clever girl in a silly coat will
come along and play you just the right way.

20:25.841 --> 20:31.571
I'll lose my friend and there won't
be chicken soup parties for me and you.

20:44.150 --> 20:46.127
OK.

20:54.285 --> 20:57.388
When will you call me? Don't say "soon".

20:57.455 --> 21:00.433
I hate it when you say soon.

21:05.088 --> 21:07.315
So this is what's
become of rock and roll?

21:07.382 --> 21:12.820
A smashed guitar behind a glass case
displayed on some rich guy's wall.

21:12.887 --> 21:15.239
It was a gift, actually.

21:17.517 --> 21:21.162
- I like it.
- Whoa! Whoa!

21:21.229 --> 21:24.957
So how did you get all this
stuff? This apartment, this life?

21:30.029 --> 21:31.130
I see.

21:37.954 --> 21:40.973
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.810
- You are, but the food's good.
- I've got a stalker.

21:44.877 --> 21:48.522
- It doesn't sound life-threatening.
- I need you to pretend

21:48.589 --> 21:53.027
we're having a scintillating conversation
and you are wildly entertained.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.780
- I know it's tough.
- I'll improvise.

21:55.846 --> 21:59.075
She's right across the room,
burning a hole in my back.

21:59.141 --> 22:02.286
- Red dress, strappy shoes?
- Yes.

22:02.979 --> 22:05.206
She's really staring at you.

22:06.983 --> 22:09.668
I'm having a drink.

22:10.236 --> 22:14.381
- Shit.
- She seems to be crying. Less happy.

22:16.283 --> 22:20.221
I think she's the saddest
girl to ever hold a Martini.

22:23.749 --> 22:26.310
- Brian Shelby.
- Jennifer Kelly.

22:28.295 --> 22:31.523
- You have another apartment?
- Sort of a day office.

22:35.970 --> 22:39.573
- I am not going in there.
- I am. Goodnight.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.451
<i>...get one thing done</i>

22:42.518 --> 22:46.497
<i>Don't like the direction
you are going to</i>

23:03.330 --> 23:05.891
<i>Don't like the direction
you have come to...</i>

23:05.958 --> 23:08.143
- I hear her coming!
- Really?

23:08.210 --> 23:09.978
No.

23:10.921 --> 23:14.775
<i>Now it has the attention that it used to</i>

23:16.176 --> 23:19.654
<i>Stay home all night
with the TV and wife...</i>

23:19.721 --> 23:22.365
Brian. How are you?

23:24.226 --> 23:26.953
We're safe, but I've
got nothing to drink.

23:27.020 --> 23:29.664
Who did these paintings?

23:30.107 --> 23:33.710
This is Joni Mitchell,
this one is Monet...

23:34.236 --> 23:39.341
...and this one was done
by me. It is a snowboard.

23:40.325 --> 23:42.802
Well, two of them are geniuses.

23:45.121 --> 23:49.726
That is the real thing. His
paintbrush painted the vanilla sky.

23:51.336 --> 23:54.481
Canvas. My mother's.

24:01.638 --> 24:03.656
I'm surprised you're surprised.

24:03.723 --> 24:06.493
- I can't keep this going.
- Me neither.

24:06.559 --> 24:09.412
- I caught you.
- Brian, come in here.

24:10.146 --> 24:12.540
- What's going on?
- I'm drunk.

24:12.607 --> 24:16.127
- Julie Gianni is stalking me.
- She looked dangerous.

24:16.194 --> 24:18.421
Nobody stalks me so I drink.

24:18.488 --> 24:22.216
- We're out of drinks up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.

24:22.283 --> 24:23.968
- Stupid glass.
- I've got it.

24:24.035 --> 24:27.472
- It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry, no big deal.

24:27.538 --> 24:31.934
- I'll get us all something.
- I'd better hit it. I drank too much.

24:32.001 --> 24:34.353
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.

24:34.420 --> 24:37.440
- You are my guest of honour.
- Fuck you, David.

24:37.507 --> 24:40.443
You're paying me to write
my novel, so you own me.

24:40.510 --> 24:43.571
I don't own you. You are
brilliant, you are handsome.

24:43.638 --> 24:47.450
But why do you have to hit on Sofia?

24:48.434 --> 24:50.328
I wasn't hitting on Sofia.

24:50.394 --> 24:53.873
Fine, whatever you say.
I'm crazy, I'm blind.

24:53.940 --> 24:57.543
You're drinking Jack Daniels. When
you drink, you start with that...

24:58.444 --> 25:02.590
...Frank Sinatra, "she shot me
down, give me a cigarette" thing.

25:02.657 --> 25:05.760
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- I'll find one.

25:05.826 --> 25:10.222
You're rich and women love you.
I'm from Ohio and I'm drunk.

25:10.289 --> 25:12.683
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.

25:12.750 --> 25:17.188
I dig her. I've never said this
to you before about any girl.

25:17.546 --> 25:19.356
But she could be...

25:19.423 --> 25:23.819
Could be, could be, could
be the girl of my dreams.

25:23.886 --> 25:26.530
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.

25:26.597 --> 25:30.159
But if she fucks up our
friendship, she can go to hell.

25:30.226 --> 25:32.911
I won't allow it. We are brothers.

25:32.978 --> 25:35.205
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.

25:35.272 --> 25:36.582
Hey!

25:36.649 --> 25:38.876
- How you doing? Gracias.
- De nada.

25:38.943 --> 25:41.795
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:41.862 --> 25:47.676
- Where are you going?
- I am Frank... and Frank must go.

25:49.411 --> 25:52.598
- What?
- I good you bid evening.

25:52.665 --> 25:54.600
Wait, I'll go with you.

25:54.666 --> 25:57.936
- Stay, baby.
- I'll give you a ride home later.

25:58.003 --> 26:00.898
No, I have to work tomorrow.

26:00.964 --> 26:03.942
You... are in great hands.

26:04.510 --> 26:08.488
I'm just humouring myself
that my opinion matters.

26:13.352 --> 26:16.955
You will never know the exquisite pain

26:17.606 --> 26:20.584
of the guy who goes home alone.

26:20.651 --> 26:25.338
Because without the bitter,
baby, the sweet ain't as sweet.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.383
Have a good time.

26:31.453 --> 26:33.805
Sweet and sour speech again.

26:36.083 --> 26:39.102
<i>Hey, I'm coming down</i>

26:39.169 --> 26:41.313
<i>Like a wrecking ball</i>

26:41.379 --> 26:43.398
<i>Breaking her heart...</i>

26:47.219 --> 26:49.613
A lot of people are scared of heights.

26:49.679 --> 26:54.826
It's not the heights that bother me,
it's the impact that terrifies me.

27:01.608 --> 27:04.043
- I won't stay long.
- Hey, Paulo!

27:06.363 --> 27:09.966
Hello. I have to take you for a walk.

27:10.325 --> 27:14.220
I need protection.
This is a lethal canine.

27:14.287 --> 27:17.974
I love living here and
I refuse to clean up.

27:18.041 --> 27:20.143
No problem.

27:20.210 --> 27:23.396
I have to work around the
clock to keep this place.

27:23.463 --> 27:26.649
- You really are a dancer.
- For 14 years.

27:26.716 --> 27:29.736
But I don't dance like you dance.

27:30.511 --> 27:34.157
- Do you want something to drink?
- Sure.

27:36.601 --> 27:40.872
Hey, Paulo. Beautiful, beautiful boy.

27:41.606 --> 27:45.668
What do you want for dinner
tonight? You want fried chicken?

27:50.740 --> 27:52.550
Paulo!

27:55.453 --> 28:00.016
- I like your life.
- It's mine and you can't have it.

28:02.627 --> 28:07.648
I don't want to know the story
behind this photo. Who's Sergio?

28:07.715 --> 28:11.068
- It's a nickname.
- Your nickname is Sergio?

28:11.135 --> 28:13.904
It's a long story, and
we don't know each other.

28:16.140 --> 28:19.160
- So many secrets.
- I'm really an arms dealer.

28:19.226 --> 28:22.746
- I've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.

28:22.813 --> 28:25.541
What about you? What's your nickname?

28:31.197 --> 28:33.257
Citizen Dildo.

28:36.285 --> 28:38.012
You are not staying over.

28:42.625 --> 28:45.894
Never run a company. Stay an
artist. Stay an arms dealer.

28:45.961 --> 28:49.565
Please. Somehow I can't
play the violin for you.

28:49.632 --> 28:54.528
Although it must be difficult
controlling all those people's lives.

28:55.262 --> 28:59.158
Everyone at that party is
connected to you for survival.

29:00.309 --> 29:02.369
It seems.

29:05.230 --> 29:07.165
Ever been married?

29:09.443 --> 29:13.463
No. Did you ever accept any
of your 12,000 proposals?

29:13.530 --> 29:16.091
12,008. No.

29:16.158 --> 29:19.344
You moved to New York to
dance, paint, act and deal arms?

29:19.411 --> 29:25.183
Right. Do you want to hear
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?

29:25.250 --> 29:30.272
Jeff Buckley or Vicki
Carr? Both. Simultaneously.

29:32.466 --> 29:37.404
Everyone said: "Don't go to New York.
" But I think good things will happen

29:37.471 --> 29:41.741
if you're a good person with a
good attitude. Don't you think?

29:45.437 --> 29:50.125
- You think I'm naive.
- No, I really don't.

29:50.609 --> 29:53.587
'I dug her completely.

29:53.653 --> 29:58.174
'Somehow, I'd found the last
semi-guileless girl in New York City. '

29:58.950 --> 30:01.094
I have to get to sleep.

30:01.828 --> 30:05.890
Truthfully, I'm also working
mornings as a dental assistant.

30:06.291 --> 30:08.685
Boy, am I going to the wrong dentist.

30:11.338 --> 30:14.816
'You didn't immediately
want to sleep with her? '

30:14.883 --> 30:18.069
'Well, you know, I'm
a pleasure delayer. '

30:20.472 --> 30:24.158
- How does that work?
- Pleasure delay? You don't know?

30:25.977 --> 30:31.457
You keep a relationship casual
until the absolute breaking point.

30:32.317 --> 30:36.170
Then one evening, or
afternoon, or morning...

30:37.322 --> 30:40.341
It could be months from now.

30:41.034 --> 30:45.304
- You know how it works.
- No, actually I don't.

30:46.873 --> 30:51.894
- I've been married for 22 years.
- You've got dinner with your daughters.

30:53.546 --> 30:55.398
That's right, I do.

30:55.465 --> 31:00.361
Back then I had intricate systems
with women you wouldn't believe.

31:03.222 --> 31:05.324
Like... what?

31:06.726 --> 31:10.288
Hey, Doc. Don't get all melancholy

31:10.354 --> 31:14.500
over the 30 seconds you
were single a long time ago.

31:14.567 --> 31:17.128
- That's what you think I'm doing?
- Yes.

31:18.237 --> 31:20.673
You might be right.

31:21.157 --> 31:24.343
Let's continue. Time is not our friend.

31:56.942 --> 32:01.130
Just our shortcomings. That's
all we're allowed to draw.

32:02.614 --> 32:05.843
I've never drawn such
a true likeness before.

32:08.620 --> 32:11.390
- Mine's finished.
- Already?

32:17.796 --> 32:19.731
Done.

32:22.676 --> 32:25.821
- That's how you see me?
- Maybe I didn't add enough money.

32:25.888 --> 32:29.449
It's something you'd see on a
wall in a steak house in hell.

32:29.516 --> 32:32.494
It's wonderful. Sign it.

32:38.150 --> 32:41.211
- Let's see yours.
- No.

32:42.279 --> 32:44.381
Give me that.

32:44.448 --> 32:47.592
<i>Just had to trust imagination</i>

32:47.659 --> 32:51.304
<i>My heart going
boom-boom-boom</i>

32:51.371 --> 32:56.059
<i>Son, he said, grab your things
I've come to take you home...</i>

32:56.668 --> 33:01.106
I feel bad. You said
to draw a caricature.

33:02.007 --> 33:05.610
I know. I couldn't. I saw you like that.

33:09.681 --> 33:11.866
It's very good.

33:13.601 --> 33:17.288
- I'll sell it to you.
- You monster.

33:18.606 --> 33:20.792
How much for?

33:22.986 --> 33:24.629
One kiss.

33:30.285 --> 33:33.304
That smile's going to be the end of me.

33:35.290 --> 33:39.143
What happens when your
friend calls you tomorrow?

33:40.879 --> 33:45.108
He just met you a few hours
before me. He'd do the same.

33:45.174 --> 33:49.404
- I see that friendship is important to you.
- It is.

33:49.470 --> 33:52.865
And as his best friend,

33:53.433 --> 33:57.537
I know he's finishing a novel
about inadequacy and rejection,

33:57.603 --> 34:01.958
so the longer I stay, the
better it is for his career.

34:02.734 --> 34:05.795
Your career is the one I'd worry about.

34:13.327 --> 34:15.096
Sorry.

34:15.161 --> 34:17.931
You're more right than you even know.

34:19.583 --> 34:22.478
I used to be one of
those guys that just...

34:23.170 --> 34:26.524
...was snowboarding through his life,

34:26.882 --> 34:30.860
with no focus whatsoever.

34:31.721 --> 34:35.324
- When did you change?
- About five minutes ago.

34:36.058 --> 34:40.286
Every passing minute is another
chance to turn it all around.

34:47.235 --> 34:51.005
'And to those who think
that you're a charlatan? '

34:51.072 --> 34:57.763
'I understand. A frozen head waiting for
reanimation sounds like science fiction. '

34:57.830 --> 34:59.723
What are you watching?

34:59.790 --> 35:03.811
It's the greatest show.
It's called "Sofia".

35:03.877 --> 35:07.689
'Lt's a new science: Life Extension. '

35:07.756 --> 35:11.193
'How do you accomplish such a thing? '

35:11.260 --> 35:13.987
I've seen this 30 times.

35:14.054 --> 35:17.616
'Life is full of surprises,
but the greatest surprise of all

35:17.683 --> 35:20.786
'is that this doesn't
have to end... ever. '

35:20.853 --> 35:23.705
We did a story on this guy.
He owns half of Arizona.

35:23.772 --> 35:27.042
- Is he a fraud?
- How would you ever know?

35:27.109 --> 35:29.044
Good point.

35:29.111 --> 35:31.505
'Can you unfreeze a human life? '

35:31.572 --> 35:34.675
'Take the case of Benny the dog.

35:34.741 --> 35:38.720
'He was frozen for three months and
thawed out to live a normal life. '

35:38.787 --> 35:43.100
That's comforting. It's safe for Benny.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.644
I'm in.

35:47.921 --> 35:50.941
'Boy will still meet girl,
they will still fall in love.

35:51.007 --> 35:55.904
'Families will flourish,
but man will meet his mind. '

35:58.432 --> 36:01.409
We'd better watch out.

36:03.645 --> 36:06.164
'Raymond Tooley, creator
of Life Extension.

36:06.231 --> 36:09.626
'The book is "Life, The Sequel".'

36:11.653 --> 36:13.254
OK.

36:17.200 --> 36:20.804
- Where are you going?
- I left my number on your fridge.

36:21.454 --> 36:23.890
Come here. I want to tell you a secret.

36:45.728 --> 36:48.748
I meant that to be your forehead.

36:53.569 --> 36:55.713
Thank you for the inspiration.

36:57.073 --> 37:01.010
I will now attempt to run
my company showing compassion

37:01.077 --> 37:06.724
for the seething throng of my partners,
who root quietly for me to fail.

37:06.791 --> 37:10.978
And for things you don't
even know. Thank you.

37:12.380 --> 37:15.983
I'm going to work. I
have a company to run.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.447
Pleasure delayer.

37:57.341 --> 37:59.234
David Aames.

38:01.387 --> 38:03.989
- Julie Gianni.
- Hey, handsome.

38:04.598 --> 38:08.744
- You're following me.
- Just a little bit.

38:08.811 --> 38:11.246
I wanted to finish what
we were talking about.

38:11.313 --> 38:12.956
And?

38:13.774 --> 38:18.212
How did it go with our moth girl?
Did she turn into a butterfly for you?

38:19.863 --> 38:21.965
Yes, she did.

38:22.950 --> 38:24.801
She did.

38:27.121 --> 38:31.558
I could tell by the way you were
walking you didn't sleep with her.

38:32.251 --> 38:35.896
Let me guess. You haven't
slept with her because

38:35.963 --> 38:40.025
it's more fun when you draw
it out. Sex just isn't as good

38:40.092 --> 38:44.988
if a woman hasn't told her
friends she'd never sleep with you.

38:45.055 --> 38:47.866
You're right on the money, Julie.

38:47.933 --> 38:52.621
She must be exhausted from trying
to be witty for you all night long.

38:54.481 --> 38:57.167
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

38:58.402 --> 39:02.047
You're never there for your friends
until they've given up on you.

39:07.536 --> 39:10.305
I'm not blowing you off. I just...

39:11.498 --> 39:14.434
I want to be alone for
a little bit. Trust me.

39:14.501 --> 39:17.395
I have a lot of things to take care of.

39:17.462 --> 39:19.939
If we're friends, which we are,

39:21.216 --> 39:23.568
then you'll understand that.

39:23.635 --> 39:26.404
I'm sorry. I got weird.

39:28.306 --> 39:30.158
I missed an audition

39:30.225 --> 39:34.496
and it made me feel bad you
didn't invite me to your party.

39:40.693 --> 39:44.464
You want to make it up to
me? I won't tell a soul.

39:46.616 --> 39:48.885
<i>You look at me</i>

39:49.661 --> 39:53.181
<i>You speak my name</i>

39:54.415 --> 39:58.311
<i>I'm counting down</i>

39:59.170 --> 40:02.440
<i>You are to blame...</i>

40:04.592 --> 40:07.987
Would you do a story
on me if I made a CD?

40:16.604 --> 40:19.165
Do you like my music?

40:20.274 --> 40:22.251
It's vivid.

40:26.489 --> 40:29.967
If I weren't me, I would buy a CD by me.

40:30.034 --> 40:33.596
You know, if you can reach one person...

40:34.372 --> 40:36.057
Wow.

40:41.837 --> 40:45.232
What's happiness to you, David?

40:45.299 --> 40:47.818
What's happiness to me?

40:49.637 --> 40:52.156
- What is happiness?
- For me...

40:53.808 --> 40:56.160
...this is happiness.

40:56.227 --> 40:58.454
It's being with you.

41:03.484 --> 41:06.629
There's one thing that bothers me.

41:06.695 --> 41:10.883
Why did you tell Brian that
I was your... fuck buddy?

41:12.201 --> 41:15.304
I didn't tell him
that. I didn't say that.

41:16.372 --> 41:20.809
- When did you stop caring, David?
- Caring about what?

41:20.876 --> 41:24.271
About the consequences of
the promises that you've made.

41:25.297 --> 41:27.941
- Promises?
- Yes, the promises.

41:29.301 --> 41:31.820
I thought...

41:31.970 --> 41:34.573
What are you talking about?

41:34.640 --> 41:38.910
Do you understand how hard it
is to pretend to be your buddy?

41:38.977 --> 41:43.624
David, I love you. I fucking love you.

41:44.775 --> 41:47.794
I fucking love you! Fuck!

41:50.781 --> 41:52.924
Don't do this, don't do this.

41:52.991 --> 41:56.178
You fucked me four times
the other night, David.

41:56.244 --> 41:59.514
You've been inside me,
I've swallowed your cum.

41:59.581 --> 42:02.058
That means something.

42:04.086 --> 42:06.396
Slow down.

42:06.463 --> 42:08.899
Four times. It means something, David.

42:08.965 --> 42:11.026
- Four times.
- Stop the car.

42:11.092 --> 42:14.195
24 hours a day, I live
with this aching possibility

42:14.262 --> 42:16.781
that you might call me to do something.

42:16.848 --> 42:19.451
Let's go to your house
and we'll talk this out.

42:20.185 --> 42:23.621
Let's just slow down. Will
you stop the car, Julie!

42:23.688 --> 42:25.749
When you sleep with someone,

42:25.815 --> 42:29.294
your body makes a promise,
whether you do or not.

42:31.946 --> 42:35.175
Tell me something, David.
Do you believe in God?

42:39.913 --> 42:42.182
What are you doing?

42:43.917 --> 42:46.436
I love you. I love you.

43:47.688 --> 43:48.956
Hello.

43:50.858 --> 43:54.378
- You're amazing. Hola.
- Hola.

43:54.779 --> 43:57.381
Did you get to work all right?

43:58.407 --> 44:00.134
Yeah.

44:00.284 --> 44:02.469
No, actually...

44:02.536 --> 44:04.680
I had a horrible dream.

44:04.747 --> 44:07.600
You dreamed you'd never see me again.

44:07.666 --> 44:10.311
I left your apartment, I
went downstairs to the car

44:10.377 --> 44:13.939
and my friend, the stalker,
had followed me there.

44:14.006 --> 44:16.650
- Julie?
- Yes.

44:16.717 --> 44:21.905
She wanted to talk to me.
I remember I had this buzz,

44:22.139 --> 44:25.617
that buzz from you and me.

44:25.684 --> 44:30.539
I think my mind was still on
that terrible drawing of me.

44:32.941 --> 44:35.961
But she was upset.

44:37.070 --> 44:40.549
I don't know. I got in the car...

44:41.325 --> 44:44.261
...and she drove off a bridge

44:44.328 --> 44:47.764
and committed suicide
with me in the car.

44:47.831 --> 44:50.934
I thought you were
going straight to work.

44:54.630 --> 44:57.441
But I survive...

44:57.507 --> 45:00.026
with my arm...

45:00.093 --> 45:04.156
and my face reconstructed.

45:05.182 --> 45:07.909
And what's worse...

45:07.976 --> 45:11.830
I can't wake up.

45:36.546 --> 45:39.816
How was your house after the party?

45:41.676 --> 45:43.695
Party?

45:44.846 --> 45:47.782
- What party?
- The party.

45:51.019 --> 45:53.121
Remember?

45:53.438 --> 45:56.249
Red dress, strappy shoes.

45:57.859 --> 46:01.296
I spilled something on your shirt.

46:01.738 --> 46:04.090
Sweet and sour,

46:04.949 --> 46:08.678
and the saddest girl
to ever hold a Martini.

46:31.642 --> 46:34.203
'My dreams are a cruel joke.

46:36.856 --> 46:38.958
'They taunt me.

46:46.949 --> 46:48.634
'Even in my dreams,

46:48.701 --> 46:52.805
'I'm an idiot who knows he's
about to wake up to reality.

46:54.957 --> 46:57.601
'Lf I could only avoid sleep...

46:59.503 --> 47:01.564
'... but I can't.

47:02.131 --> 47:06.652
'I try to tell myself what to dream.
I try to dream that I'm flying.

47:08.179 --> 47:09.738
'Something free.

47:11.807 --> 47:14.201
'Lt never works. '

47:21.400 --> 47:24.253
Is that the only thing you dream?

47:26.655 --> 47:29.007
I don't remember.

47:34.955 --> 47:37.975
Do you dream about the car accident?

47:38.042 --> 47:42.396
Here's what you remember from a coma
- nothing.

47:46.925 --> 47:51.029
- What happened next?
- What really happened?

47:52.681 --> 47:57.911
Didn't you read the file? I was
out for three and a half weeks.

47:57.978 --> 48:01.665
My face and arm shattered,
my jaw broken in four places.

48:02.941 --> 48:06.461
No surgery could be
performed because of the coma.

48:07.696 --> 48:11.758
You can't feel the darkness or numbness.

48:13.160 --> 48:15.720
You can't even feel.

48:15.996 --> 48:19.766
And then, I came back to life.

48:22.502 --> 48:27.023
Just like that dog,
Benny. Benny the dog.

48:28.049 --> 48:30.402
Benny. Benny the dog.

48:30.468 --> 48:33.571
Only my life was no longer enjoyable.

48:34.514 --> 48:39.411
There are blinding migraines
now. Nerve damage. Why?

48:39.477 --> 48:43.623
This is how big business operates.

48:43.690 --> 48:48.086
Random accidents, a lifestyle mishap.

48:48.153 --> 48:50.421
They are not coincidences.

48:50.488 --> 48:54.759
How do you think airtight
contracts are broken?

48:54.826 --> 48:58.304
These are power upheavals.

48:58.371 --> 49:03.101
I'm from Ohio. We don't
have power upheavals.

49:03.168 --> 49:07.021
They're in the news every
day, right between the lines.

49:08.381 --> 49:10.441
Someone did this to me.

49:11.801 --> 49:14.278
My father wrote about this in his book.

49:14.345 --> 49:17.990
Chapter one, page one, paragraph one.

49:18.516 --> 49:22.245
"What is the answer to
99 out of 100 questions?

49:23.980 --> 49:25.414
"Money. "

49:25.481 --> 49:27.834
'David, I don't want to worry you.

49:27.900 --> 49:31.003
'I'm holding them off, but
we've got a situation here. '

49:34.615 --> 49:36.926
Only if you're mentally acute.

49:36.993 --> 49:39.262
'I'm sorry that poor girl died,

49:39.328 --> 49:42.640
'but you've handed the board
a gift with your mishap.

49:42.707 --> 49:46.310
'They'd like to declare
you incapacitated.

49:46.377 --> 49:48.980
'But you're back.

49:49.046 --> 49:52.983
'You sound good to me,
so let's fight the fuckers

49:53.050 --> 49:57.363
'and have a full recovery. Maybe
you should let people see you. '

49:57.430 --> 50:00.616
The last time we were
together, you were in a coma

50:00.683 --> 50:05.329
and you were very fucking rude
to me. You didn't say a word.

50:05.730 --> 50:10.626
The rumours of my death
have been mildly exaggerated.

50:14.113 --> 50:19.093
'Who could I trust? The ants
were taking over the ant hill.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.347
'Who could I trust? '

51:24.224 --> 51:27.577
'The cranial structure
was based on 30 pins,

51:27.644 --> 51:31.122
'and fastened by micro panels
and bone from the mandible.

51:31.189 --> 51:34.167
'The grafts have maintained
your cheek structure.

51:34.234 --> 51:36.753
Unfortunately, as you were in a coma...

51:36.820 --> 51:40.507
'Doctors. Their power is
in jargon, so you study up.

51:40.574 --> 51:43.760
Is that the procedure for
all bilateral haematomas

51:43.827 --> 51:46.805
in a LeFort llI fracture
of a comatose patient?

51:46.871 --> 51:48.723
'You do your best. '

51:48.790 --> 51:52.352
The potential for intra-cranial
brain damage was too great.

51:52.419 --> 51:54.187
Beyond the cheek grafts,

51:54.254 --> 51:57.232
are the pins fastened
with any kind of aluminium

51:57.298 --> 52:00.360
which could cause the
pressure in my head?

52:00.427 --> 52:02.487
We're working on prostheses,

52:02.554 --> 52:06.407
but you're not at the stage
where we can experiment.

52:07.934 --> 52:09.953
Experiment. Use me.

52:10.061 --> 52:14.415
- The headaches will go away.
- These are more than headaches.

52:15.191 --> 52:19.253
These are like steel plates
slicing through my every thought.

52:19.320 --> 52:21.631
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.

52:22.448 --> 52:25.009
I can't think straight most of the time.

52:25.076 --> 52:29.138
- We can increase your medication.
- Yes. Medication.

52:30.081 --> 52:34.685
We'll continue to investigate.
However, there are so many others

52:34.752 --> 52:39.273
who have not had the aesthetic
benefit of plastic surgery as you have.

52:39.841 --> 52:43.069
This isn't about vanity, Dr Pomerantz.

52:43.136 --> 52:46.948
This isn't about vanity. This is
about functioning in the world.

52:47.014 --> 52:50.117
It's my job to be out there functioning.

52:50.184 --> 52:52.828
I've got the money. I'll pay any amount.

52:54.021 --> 52:57.625
Just invent something! Just play jazz.

52:57.733 --> 53:01.837
You say you're the best face
man in New York? Prove it!

53:05.533 --> 53:09.011
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!

53:13.207 --> 53:16.268
Nobody here takes your
feelings for granted.

53:16.335 --> 53:19.813
We prepared something based
on the preliminary examination.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.440
Bring it on!

53:21.507 --> 53:25.194
It's sometimes useful in the
early stages of rejection.

53:25.261 --> 53:28.322
It's a facial prosthetic. It
was two weeks in the making.

53:28.389 --> 53:30.949
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.

53:40.818 --> 53:44.713
- A facial prosthetic?
- The aesthetic replacement does work.

53:44.780 --> 53:47.591
Emotionally and actually.

53:47.658 --> 53:50.719
The plastic in the shield
blocks out abusive rays

53:50.786 --> 53:54.181
and assists in the
regeneration of cells.

53:55.040 --> 53:59.144
- It's an aesthetic regenerative shield?
- That's correct.

53:59.211 --> 54:02.439
The ergonomics of the plate
barrier allows it to interact

54:02.506 --> 54:06.193
- with the movements of your face.
- I see.

54:06.760 --> 54:10.030
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.

54:10.097 --> 54:12.991
For a minute there, I
thought we were talking about

54:13.058 --> 54:15.285
a fucking mask!

54:17.062 --> 54:20.749
It's only a mask if
you treat it that way.

54:20.816 --> 54:25.003
No, it's great. This completely
takes care of Halloween.

54:27.322 --> 54:32.052
But what about the other
364 days of the year?

54:46.132 --> 54:49.235
'A new form of me began to take shape.

54:49.302 --> 54:54.824
'I planned my re-emergence
like the Normandy invasion. '

54:56.893 --> 54:58.620
Sofia. Sofia.

54:58.687 --> 55:01.456
So-fi-a...
Serrano.

55:02.440 --> 55:04.459
'I'll just say it.

55:04.526 --> 55:08.421
'I did my homework. I read every memo.

55:09.531 --> 55:13.968
'Thomas Tipp was right
- people will read again.

55:15.328 --> 55:18.931
'I attended the monthly meeting
of the Seven Dwarfs by video. '

55:18.998 --> 55:22.602
People aren't buying
books! Let's invest.

55:22.669 --> 55:25.355
'Oh, baby. This was war.

55:26.172 --> 55:28.816
'I grew stronger in ways I'd never known

55:28.883 --> 55:33.488
'and on December 5th,
my planes filled the sky.

55:33.554 --> 55:38.284
'The return of David
Aames, Jr. Citizen Dildo. '

55:50.947 --> 55:53.174
Did you see his face?

56:17.348 --> 56:20.659
You won't believe this...

56:23.062 --> 56:26.373
...but this is me smiling.

56:32.404 --> 56:34.256
It's been a long time.

56:34.323 --> 56:37.968
I tried to see you, but
your people wouldn't let me.

56:38.035 --> 56:40.763
I didn't want to see me, OK?

56:41.413 --> 56:45.768
But then I woke up today, and finally...

56:46.877 --> 56:48.687
...a good hair day.

56:52.549 --> 56:54.318
You want to get together?

56:57.054 --> 56:58.155
Sure.

57:00.099 --> 57:02.868
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.

57:02.935 --> 57:07.080
This weekend. I'll cancel
an operation or two.

57:07.564 --> 57:09.583
We'll have fun.

57:09.650 --> 57:13.587
Because I am all about fun.

57:16.531 --> 57:20.135
'Our first guest tonight is
an amazing survival story.

57:20.202 --> 57:22.429
'Please welcome Benny the dog!

57:28.043 --> 57:30.896
'Welcome to the show, Gary.

57:30.962 --> 57:33.023
'I have so many questions.

57:33.090 --> 57:37.777
'Tell us what has happened to
Benny? What's Benny been through? '

57:38.637 --> 57:41.573
'Benny fell into the water near our home

57:41.640 --> 57:46.036
- 'and was frozen in the Skykomish river. '
- 'Ln Washington. '

57:46.102 --> 57:49.914
'I went fishing, thinking he'd
been gone for three months,

57:49.981 --> 57:53.293
'and I see him in a block of ice. '

57:53.985 --> 57:56.379
'He is thawed out now, is that correct?

57:56.446 --> 57:59.924
'He's not moving a lot. I'm worried.

57:59.991 --> 58:02.677
'I'm worried about the dog. '

58:02.744 --> 58:06.347
'He's fine. He's just lost
a little of his friskiness. '

58:06.873 --> 58:09.017
Sofia? It's David.

58:09.793 --> 58:13.897
I'm back in your life.
I saw you earlier today.

58:13.963 --> 58:19.819
I was just watching our old
friend Benny the dog on "Conan"

58:21.262 --> 58:24.073
and I thought of you.

58:24.307 --> 58:26.701
Whatever. I...

58:27.977 --> 58:30.413
...I loved seeing you today.

58:31.147 --> 58:33.916
So I will see you soon.

58:35.109 --> 58:37.462
You're a great dancer.

59:30.414 --> 59:33.225
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.

59:33.292 --> 59:36.520
I'm in the mood for a cheap,
overpriced rum and Coke.

59:36.587 --> 59:38.689
- Do you want one?
- Is there any other kind?

59:38.756 --> 59:42.443
- I'll get us some.
- Where is the bathroom?

59:42.801 --> 59:44.903
It's behind...

59:44.970 --> 59:49.158
Over there, by the girl
who looks like Björk.

59:49.224 --> 59:52.035
- I'll be right back.
- Maybe I should...

59:53.687 --> 59:56.248
You look good. How's your book?

59:56.732 --> 59:59.710
- Take it off.
- This is a facial shield.

59:59.777 --> 01:00:03.172
It's kind of like a prosthesis.

01:00:03.238 --> 01:00:05.674
Take off the mask. It's freaking me out.

01:00:05.741 --> 01:00:07.759
I can't.

01:00:08.243 --> 01:00:11.138
It's my face. This is my face.

01:00:11.205 --> 01:00:13.682
Trust me, it's a little different.

01:00:13.749 --> 01:00:18.020
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.

01:00:18.086 --> 01:00:19.980
Sofia asked me.

01:00:20.047 --> 01:00:22.899
She didn't want to be alone
with me? That's bullshit!

01:00:22.966 --> 01:00:25.902
I'm being pretty cool
about this whole thing.

01:00:25.969 --> 01:00:29.656
Talk to a shrink. Or are
you going to call me sometime

01:00:29.723 --> 01:00:31.908
instead of hiding in your apartment?

01:00:31.975 --> 01:00:35.454
Don't take it out on a
girl you only met once.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.707
Did she say that? Once?

01:00:38.774 --> 01:00:40.792
She said I met her once?

01:00:40.859 --> 01:00:44.337
Just cut it out. I miss the old you.

01:00:45.322 --> 01:00:47.340
We all miss the old you.

01:00:47.407 --> 01:00:50.135
Because the new guy is shit.

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:55.974
That came out wrong. I love you. Period.

01:00:56.625 --> 01:00:59.894
- How's your arm, man?
- Fuck you, Brian.

01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:05.859
How about no sympathy? How
about that's the deal we make?

01:01:17.228 --> 01:01:20.123
Give me a Budweiser
and a shot of tequila.

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:22.083
What kind of tequila?

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:27.505
- What did you say to me?
- I said, "What kind of tequila?"

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:32.176
Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch?

01:01:35.538 --> 01:01:37.807
Patron, if you have it.

01:01:37.874 --> 01:01:40.101
<i>They are setting the stage</i>

01:01:40.168 --> 01:01:42.645

01:01:42.712 --> 01:01:46.315
<i>To control your mind

01:01:46.382 --> 01:01:50.444
<i>Free Zulu nation here to stay</i>

01:01:57.727 --> 01:02:00.538
<i>Let's get electrofied

01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:04.125

01:02:04.484 --> 01:02:06.627
<i>Pump it, rockin' it, stickin'

01:02:06.694 --> 01:02:09.880
- Another shot, another Bud.
- This is on the house.

01:02:09.947 --> 01:02:14.176
- Why?
- It just is... bitch.

01:02:14.243 --> 01:02:15.845
<i>...that's the way you say Zulu</i>

01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:19.390

01:03:05.169 --> 01:03:07.271
Patron!

01:03:16.054 --> 01:03:18.740
Fix your fucking face!

01:04:10.483 --> 01:04:12.877
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:16.047
Idea
- let's start over.

01:04:17.407 --> 01:04:21.010
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

01:04:21.077 --> 01:04:23.429
"You are, but the food is good. "

01:04:23.496 --> 01:04:27.141
I've got this little
problem. I've got a stalker.

01:04:28.793 --> 01:04:31.271
"It doesn't sound life-threatening. "

01:04:31.337 --> 01:04:35.066
I need you to pretend we're
having a scintillating conversation

01:04:35.133 --> 01:04:39.320
and you are wildly
entertained. I know it's tough.

01:04:40.179 --> 01:04:43.157
- "I'll improvise. "
- I don't talk like that.

01:04:44.225 --> 01:04:47.954
She's right across the room,
burning a hole in my back.

01:04:51.733 --> 01:04:54.418
Red dress, strappy shoes.

01:04:57.572 --> 01:04:59.632
That's right.

01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:05.513
I think she is the saddest
girl to ever hold a Martini.

01:05:19.093 --> 01:05:21.362
- Are you OK?
- No.

01:05:22.013 --> 01:05:24.115
What's wrong? Is it me?

01:05:25.433 --> 01:05:27.368
- Is it me?
- I'll tell you later.

01:05:27.435 --> 01:05:30.663
Tell me now. If something's
wrong, please tell me now.

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:34.708
- Just talk about everything.
- I'll tell you later!

01:05:34.775 --> 01:05:37.461
Let's get it all out.
Say everything now.

01:05:37.528 --> 01:05:41.173
Just say everything. Say
everything now, now, now.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:45.177
I'll tell you in another
life when we are both cats.

01:05:50.791 --> 01:05:53.936
I can't believe you just said that.

01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:58.774
That's the greatest
thing I've ever heard.

01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:01.819
That's hilarious. That you said that.

01:06:02.428 --> 01:06:05.322
That's... You said that. You said that.

01:06:05.389 --> 01:06:08.909
That is what I love about you.

01:06:09.852 --> 01:06:12.371
That's hilarious.

01:06:12.438 --> 01:06:15.916
I'll tell you in another
life when we are both cats.

01:06:17.234 --> 01:06:19.461
Cats! Cats!

01:06:25.409 --> 01:06:29.179
- This is where I leave you.
- I'll walk you to your door.

01:06:29.246 --> 01:06:32.224
- I live just around the corner.
- I've got my bike.

01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:34.393
- I'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.

01:06:34.459 --> 01:06:37.187
Can't you see she
wants to go on her own?

01:06:37.254 --> 01:06:39.773
Shut up, you're drunk.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.110
I may be an idiot, but I'm not drunk.

01:06:43.176 --> 01:06:47.614
Seriously, I don't need you
to walk me home. Thank you.

01:06:48.557 --> 01:06:50.575
OK, then, so...

01:06:50.976 --> 01:06:53.119
...we'll call you.

01:06:53.186 --> 01:06:56.289
We'll go catch a movie or something.

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.334
So we'll meet up soon.

01:07:02.779 --> 01:07:04.506
We'll meet up soon.

01:07:14.499 --> 01:07:17.727
We'll call you again to go out with me.

01:07:18.545 --> 01:07:20.897
We'll call you.

01:07:21.089 --> 01:07:24.734
It's been a real blast,
David. I bid you good evening.

01:07:24.801 --> 01:07:26.903
Wait, where are you going?

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:29.989
My bike is back over
there. We'll hang soon.

01:07:30.056 --> 01:07:33.201
Bring your mask if you
want. I'm getting used to it.

01:07:35.311 --> 01:07:37.956
- Wait a minute.
- What?

01:07:40.567 --> 01:07:42.335
I don't know.

01:07:42.402 --> 01:07:45.505
You drank too much. Call me tomorrow.

01:07:45.572 --> 01:07:48.383
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.

01:07:50.743 --> 01:07:53.638
No, you won't. You just need to sleep.

01:07:56.332 --> 01:07:59.393
- Hey. Hey!
- What?

01:08:04.632 --> 01:08:08.986
What did you say to Julie
Gianni the night of the accident?

01:08:09.053 --> 01:08:15.868
- What?
- You told her she was a fuck buddy.

01:08:16.685 --> 01:08:18.621
Never.

01:08:18.688 --> 01:08:22.041
She was a little more
than pissed about it.

01:08:22.692 --> 01:08:25.795
Have you been harbouring
this shit all along?

01:08:25.861 --> 01:08:28.546
I never talked to her.

01:08:32.158 --> 01:08:34.303
Whatever.

01:08:35.955 --> 01:08:40.975
Anyway, who am I if I can't be the
one to tell you you're not ugly?

01:08:42.336 --> 01:08:46.148
Come on! Give me a courtesy laugh!

01:08:47.133 --> 01:08:52.154
Brian, I'm so fucked
up. I'm just so fucked up

01:08:59.395 --> 01:09:03.665
We're best friends! We're bro's!

01:09:03.732 --> 01:09:06.877
Come on, man. We're bro's.

01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:18.680
<i>Readying to bury your
father and your mother</i>

01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:24.978
<i>What did you think when you lost another</i>

01:09:25.546 --> 01:09:31.109
<i>I used to wonder why did you bother</i>

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:37.407
<i>Distanced from one, blind to the other</i>

01:09:38.392 --> 01:09:43.537

01:09:44.064 --> 01:09:49.711
<i>What would you care
if you lost the other</i>

01:09:50.194 --> 01:09:55.675
<i>I always wonder why did we bother</i>

01:09:56.284 --> 01:10:01.973
<i>Distanced from one, blind to the other</i>

01:10:02.833 --> 01:10:07.771

<i>Oh... but sweetness follows...</i>

Open your eyes.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:55.360
Boo!

01:10:56.302 --> 01:11:01.824
- This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
- I'm OK. I'm OK.

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:04.744
And it worked. Get up.

01:11:05.436 --> 01:11:06.996
I agree.

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:12.084
This is a joke.

01:11:12.151 --> 01:11:15.046
David, I'm not going to lie to you.

01:11:15.113 --> 01:11:18.382
I liked the way you looked. But...

01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:22.595
...you have to pull
it the fuck together.

01:11:22.662 --> 01:11:25.514
If not, I'll forget the other guy.

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:29.185
You know that other guy? You?

01:11:30.086 --> 01:11:32.980
I'm still that guy.

01:11:33.047 --> 01:11:38.277
I don't have a mother saviour bone
in my body. It's not about that.

01:11:38.344 --> 01:11:42.782
You are coming inside, but if this
turns out to be a big mistake...

01:11:43.516 --> 01:11:48.579

out of love with you like that.

- Where's Brian?
- Brian? He went with you, didn't he?

01:12:10.084 --> 01:12:12.728
I thought you guys hooked up.

01:12:13.837 --> 01:12:17.608

the car with that girl.

my life in a zillion different ways.

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.921

that I actually deserved it. '

01:13:03.095 --> 01:13:05.030
Ah, Sofia.

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:09.618
I see you haven't
been wasting your time.

01:13:09.976 --> 01:13:14.205
- Do you ever draw anything else?
- No.

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.292
Did you sleep last night?

01:13:17.776 --> 01:13:19.502
I love you.

01:13:19.986 --> 01:13:21.796
No, I did not sleep.

01:13:21.863 --> 01:13:25.842
Got to leave early today, David,
so you'll have to be brief.

01:13:25.909 --> 01:13:30.388
What can you tell me
about the name Ellie?

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.642
Ellie.

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:37.520
Was that a girl you were in love with?

01:13:37.587 --> 01:13:39.814
I've only been in love once.

01:13:39.881 --> 01:13:43.276
Apparently you kept
repeating it last night.

01:13:43.343 --> 01:13:47.363
You did sleep, David. Your
advisor said you cried out.

01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:50.325
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.

01:13:50.391 --> 01:13:54.203
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?

01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:59.709
I... I don't...

01:14:00.902 --> 01:14:04.547
Dig deep, David. Dig deep.

01:14:04.614 --> 01:14:09.051
You cried out for Ellie. What
do you remember about Ellie?

01:14:10.495 --> 01:14:12.972
Show me your face, David.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:17.393
Help me open the door.

01:14:27.011 --> 01:14:31.157
It's true you had an accident,
it's true you were disfigured.

01:14:31.224 --> 01:14:33.451
But not any more.

01:14:33.809 --> 01:14:36.078
Do you remember?

01:14:37.563 --> 01:14:40.583
They did fix your face.

01:14:41.984 --> 01:14:47.298
Take off that mask, David. You'll
see your face is perfect under there.

01:14:48.616 --> 01:14:51.594
I never trusted the doctors.

01:14:52.953 --> 01:14:56.182
What happened next was surreal.

01:14:57.166 --> 01:15:00.686
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr Pomerantz, called me

01:15:00.753 --> 01:15:03.314
and suddenly he was my new best friend.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:08.068
David! My brother! I felt really
bad about our last conversation.

01:15:08.135 --> 01:15:11.530
'He'd discovered a new form
of reconstructive surgery

01:15:11.597 --> 01:15:14.033
'with the help of a
doctor from Berlin. '

01:15:14.099 --> 01:15:15.367
Hello.

01:15:15.434 --> 01:15:19.496
'Next thing I knew, they shot me
full of drugs I'd never heard of

01:15:19.563 --> 01:15:21.707
'and away we went. '

01:15:21.774 --> 01:15:25.919
<i>What if God was one of us?</i>

01:15:27.488 --> 01:15:31.383
<i>Just a slob like one of us?</i>

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:34.636
<i>Trying to make his way home...</i>

01:15:34.703 --> 01:15:36.513
He's got a good voice.

01:15:43.462 --> 01:15:46.898
And facial tissue could be regenerated.

01:15:46.965 --> 01:15:50.569
...the concept of endoscopic,
periorbital fibre optics.

01:15:50.636 --> 01:15:54.406
- Where are we eating later?
- I can't even tell you what they did.

01:15:54.473 --> 01:15:56.742
It seemed like science fiction.

01:15:56.808 --> 01:16:00.954
Madonna had that song "Borderline".
That was a hell of a song.

01:16:01.021 --> 01:16:04.374
This is going to be one
good-looking guy when I'm done.

01:16:04.441 --> 01:16:07.043
'Obviously I was suspicious. '

01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:12.757
- Wouldn't you be?
- Suspicious of whom? Of what?

01:16:13.325 --> 01:16:17.971
Doc, once you've been driven
off a bridge at 80 miles an hour,

01:16:18.413 --> 01:16:23.310
somehow you don't invite happiness
in without a full body search.

01:16:26.546 --> 01:16:31.234
At the risk of boring you, I can
present the alternate argument.

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:36.656
I once knew a guy who was a real loner.

01:16:37.974 --> 01:16:40.118
One day he woke up at 40

01:16:40.185 --> 01:16:43.538
with two daughters that lit
up his life with purpose.

01:16:43.605 --> 01:16:46.332
He suddenly goes to
endless school plays,

01:16:46.399 --> 01:16:49.627
he gets home at 9:20 for
the evening discussion

01:16:49.694 --> 01:16:52.672
and he has the time of his life.

01:16:53.448 --> 01:16:57.677
His favourite Beatle was
once John and now it's Paul.

01:17:00.038 --> 01:17:02.890
I always liked George.

01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:07.186
It all depends on the
individual, doesn't it?

01:17:07.253 --> 01:17:11.441
- Tell me, what's happiness for you?
- What's happiness to you, David?

01:17:13.009 --> 01:17:17.613
- How about another question?
- You won't show me your face, will you?

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.119
So, back to the timeline.
Hurry, let's move through this.

01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:25.204
David!

01:17:26.731 --> 01:17:29.625
- David?
- What?

01:17:31.736 --> 01:17:36.215
- You've got to take the plates off.
- I don't want to know what's under here.

01:17:36.282 --> 01:17:38.551
It'll be fine, you'll see.

01:17:38.618 --> 01:17:42.054
I called Pomerantz and
switched it to Wednesday.

01:17:47.793 --> 01:17:49.520
What?

01:17:51.088 --> 01:17:54.859
I hope that women at the front
desk gave you shit about it.

01:17:56.135 --> 01:17:59.530
Another day won't matter,
and the Mustang will be fixed.

01:17:59.597 --> 01:18:02.867
The plan was going in the
Mustang. It's not ready.

01:18:02.933 --> 01:18:07.162
So we'll go tomorrow in the
Mustang, when it's fixed.

01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:09.373
I know that the problem

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.502
wouldn't be you delaying
something you were dreading.

01:18:15.613 --> 01:18:19.174
- Couldn't be that.
- No, couldn't be that.

01:18:22.036 --> 01:18:24.012
I mean...

01:18:32.796 --> 01:18:35.607
I mean... I agree.

01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:41.238
I think it's very important to have...

01:18:44.057 --> 01:18:46.702
...the right car...

01:18:53.525 --> 01:18:55.335
...to take you...

01:18:57.446 --> 01:19:00.298
...where you want to go...

01:19:04.703 --> 01:19:06.888
...24 hours a day.

01:19:32.439 --> 01:19:34.582
How bad is it?

01:19:37.819 --> 01:19:41.172
Well, your ears are in the right place.

01:19:43.742 --> 01:19:46.386
And the rest of it...

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.266
...is not too bad at all.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.648
It's perfect.

01:20:13.813 --> 01:20:18.960
<i>When she said, "Don't waste
your words, they're just lies,"</i>

01:20:19.027 --> 01:20:22.004
<i>I cried she was deaf</i>

01:20:24.032 --> 01:20:30.137
<i>And she worked on my face
until breaking my eyes</i>

01:20:30.204 --> 01:20:33.474
<i>Then said, "What else
have you got left?"</i>

01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:38.437
<i>It was then that I got up to leave</i>

01:20:38.504 --> 01:20:41.190
<i>But she said, "Don't forget,</i>

01:20:42.967 --> 01:20:47.113
<i>Everybody must give something back</i>

01:20:47.179 --> 01:20:49.031
<i>For something they get...</i>

01:20:49.849 --> 01:20:53.077
Do you love me? I mean really love me?

01:20:53.936 --> 01:20:58.332
Because if you don't,
I'll just have to kill you.

01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:04.713
In my next life...

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:09.260
In my next life, I'm going to
come back as this mole right here.

01:21:10.327 --> 01:21:13.097
Seriously, this mole.

01:21:13.164 --> 01:21:19.061
You'll have to wear bikini tops
to work so that I can breathe.

01:21:19.795 --> 01:21:22.815
I love you. Love you.

01:21:25.593 --> 01:21:27.653
I love you.

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:30.989
I can live right there.

01:21:36.103 --> 01:21:38.372
Is this a dream?

01:21:39.106 --> 01:21:40.958
Absolutely.

01:21:51.618 --> 01:21:54.972
'We talked about the big
things, the little things...

01:21:55.038 --> 01:21:57.349
'... and the big things.

01:21:57.833 --> 01:22:02.020
'But, in truth, with Sofia
it was the in-between times. '

01:22:04.464 --> 01:22:08.276
<i>In the days When we were
swinging from the trees</i>

01:22:08.343 --> 01:22:11.279
<i>I was a monkey...</i>

01:22:11.346 --> 01:22:12.823
Je t'aime.

01:22:12.889 --> 01:22:16.910
<i>Stealing honey from a swarm of bees</i>

01:22:16.977 --> 01:22:20.789
<i>I could taste</i>

01:22:20.856 --> 01:22:24.084
<i>I could taste you even then</i>

01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:26.628
<i>And I would chase you...</i>

01:22:26.695 --> 01:22:29.923
- What did she say?
- I have no idea.

01:22:33.493 --> 01:22:35.553
- How's things, Brian?
- Fine.

01:22:36.288 --> 01:22:38.598
Brian, how's things?

01:22:38.665 --> 01:22:41.601
Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.

01:22:41.668 --> 01:22:45.355
Besides, Sofia is great, but
by no means one of a kind.

01:22:45.422 --> 01:22:48.483
She was a proximity infatuation.

01:22:49.551 --> 01:22:52.278
Don't use that, it's mine.

01:22:53.722 --> 01:22:55.782
Where did you get this camera?

01:22:55.849 --> 01:22:59.327
I'm into things you
have no idea, my friend.

01:23:00.728 --> 01:23:04.999
- Just so long as you're OK.
- Anyway, we're friends, aren't we?

01:23:05.191 --> 01:23:07.210
- Always.
- That's right.

01:23:19.956 --> 01:23:22.266
What's up with your face?

01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:24.268
Fuck!

01:23:24.335 --> 01:23:27.396
There's a seam opening or something!

01:23:32.719 --> 01:23:35.238
- David Aames.
- You fucking asshole.

01:23:36.055 --> 01:23:38.115
I know.

01:24:58.554 --> 01:25:00.864
Was I snoring?

01:25:02.224 --> 01:25:07.537
No. I think it was me. I
was thirsty, that's all.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.753
I'm dreaming about you. Mmm.

01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:33.873
I could listen to you say
"mmm" for the rest of my life.

01:26:46.994 --> 01:26:48.638
Baby, what's wrong?

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:57.480
- Where is she?
- Who?

01:27:02.426 --> 01:27:03.611
Who?

01:27:30.329 --> 01:27:32.598
I'm Sofia.

01:27:36.627 --> 01:27:41.231
I'm going to make sure that I tie
it four times. You know why, Julie?

01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:44.443
Because four times
really means something.

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:46.904
Please don't hurt me.

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.656
I'm freaked out, it worked.

01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:54.703
You won't get away with this,
so just tell me where Sofia is.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.123
- I am Sofia.
- Where's Sofia?

01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:01.460
- I am Sofia!
- Where is she?

01:28:01.527 --> 01:28:04.087
I'm calling the police. Tell it to them.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:07.716
You survived the accident.
Whose body was it?

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:10.969
It was the board, the
Seven Dwarfs, wasn't it?

01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:15.057
You're trying to steal my life!
You weren't in an accident.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.684
Now it's attempted murder!

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:20.145
I am Sofia, please!

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.607
Tell it to them.

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:27.444
This is David Aames. I need help.

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:31.823
I've captured an intruder
who's entered my home.

01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:33.158
Oh, God!

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:37.913
Wake up man. Are you for real?

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:50.884
They've kept me here for three hours.

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:54.304
They think that I had
something to do with this.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:57.432
Can you give us a minute here?

01:28:57.499 --> 01:28:59.809
Thanks very much.

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:04.856
They think I had
something to do with this.

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:08.443
We're going to handle this
the way your father would.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:12.322
- I've got it solved.
- You've got it solved?

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:14.657
Where is she?

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:19.537
She's going to be fine. This
whole file is going to...

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:25.251
Thank God you're here.

01:29:25.735 --> 01:29:26.919
It's OK.

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:29.881
I love her.

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:34.469
Look at these photos, then
I'm going to destroy them.

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:38.931
Sofia's testimony is also
in here. It won't exist.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:42.393
She's not going to press charges.

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:49.901
- Press charges against me?
- David, wake up.

01:29:53.137 --> 01:29:55.239
As a friend...

01:29:55.806 --> 01:30:00.077
...I think you should
see what you did to Sofia.

01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:05.249
The press won't get hold of
this if you get away quickly.

01:30:07.443 --> 01:30:10.421
This is Julie Gianni, this is not Sofia.

01:30:11.697 --> 01:30:13.716
This is Julie Gianni.

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:17.887
I didn't do this to her.
Someone's setting me up.

01:30:17.953 --> 01:30:21.849
David, the board and I have
taken care of everything.

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:25.811
They've been really great, actually.

01:30:25.961 --> 01:30:32.818
All this is going to disappear.
We're all behind you, even the board.

01:30:44.813 --> 01:30:46.707
Get out of here.

01:30:50.319 --> 01:30:52.755
This is a revolution of the mind.

01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:04.057
You're insane!

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:06.935
Don't ever hit a girl!

01:31:07.002 --> 01:31:09.980
Hit me, but don't ever hit a girl!

01:31:10.047 --> 01:31:12.983
It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.

01:31:14.009 --> 01:31:17.654
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.

01:31:19.598 --> 01:31:22.617
So Sofia was abducted by Julie

01:31:23.101 --> 01:31:25.996
and now Julie is posing as Sofia.

01:31:28.815 --> 01:31:31.710
You're in OJ land, man.

01:31:32.110 --> 01:31:34.212
Julie Gianni is dead!

01:31:34.279 --> 01:31:40.010
I don't care what they told you. I
can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.

01:31:40.076 --> 01:31:45.599
- I didn't talk to them, I talked to Sofia.
- Where is she?

01:31:45.665 --> 01:31:49.019
I just dropped Sofia off. I
saw everything you did to her.

01:31:49.085 --> 01:31:51.563
I did not do that to her.

01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:58.778
Look me in the eye and tell me that's
the girl you brought to the party.

01:31:58.845 --> 01:32:03.867
Tell me that's your dream girl,
your proximity infatuation.

01:32:03.933 --> 01:32:07.704
Yes! And you stole her from me.

01:32:07.771 --> 01:32:11.875
The one girl I really wanted
and you took her from me.

01:32:11.941 --> 01:32:14.961
You're insane. You're losing it, man!

01:32:15.111 --> 01:32:18.548
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:21.801
I'm with them.

01:32:26.372 --> 01:32:31.311
Where did you get the coat, Brian?
Where did you get the camera?

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.063
How much did they pay you?

01:32:35.048 --> 01:32:39.527
Listen to me, because this is the
last time we're ever going to speak.

01:32:39.594 --> 01:32:44.031
- I was your only friend.
- You have revealed yourself to me.

01:33:07.496 --> 01:33:09.181
Problems?

01:33:10.207 --> 01:33:13.144
I'm in no mood to be fucked with, so...

01:33:13.210 --> 01:33:16.397
There's an explanation
for all this, David.

01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:21.694
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.

01:33:23.304 --> 01:33:26.115
I'm here to help you, David.

01:33:27.975 --> 01:33:31.871
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?

01:33:31.937 --> 01:33:35.499
First of all, it's very
important that you calm down.

01:33:37.026 --> 01:33:40.754
Calm down? Calm down!

01:33:40.821 --> 01:33:44.174
You must overcome your
fears and regain control.

01:33:44.241 --> 01:33:48.429
Take hold of your life again, David.
It's as easy as holding that glass.

01:33:49.622 --> 01:33:54.476
What if I were to tell you that
you can take control of all of this?

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.104
Even me.

01:33:57.921 --> 01:34:00.023
I'm straight, OK?

01:34:04.344 --> 01:34:07.406
David, look at all these people.

01:34:07.473 --> 01:34:10.951
Seems as though they're all
just chatting away, doesn't it?

01:34:11.018 --> 01:34:13.370
- Nothing to do with you?
- No.

01:34:13.437 --> 01:34:18.500
And yet maybe they're only here
because you wanted them to be here.

01:34:19.818 --> 01:34:21.962
You are their god.

01:34:22.029 --> 01:34:26.508
You can make them obey
you or even destroy you.

01:34:26.575 --> 01:34:30.887
What I'd love for them
to do is shut the fuck up,

01:34:30.954 --> 01:34:32.472
especially you.

01:34:44.843 --> 01:34:46.486
You see?

01:34:58.607 --> 01:35:01.167
You and I signed a contract, David.

01:35:01.234 --> 01:35:04.254
'Who is the man in the
restaurant? ' Who is it?

01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:10.051
Can you tell the difference
between dreams and reality?

01:35:10.118 --> 01:35:12.762
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.

01:35:13.913 --> 01:35:19.310
Think with your head. You
signed a contract, did you not?

01:35:21.212 --> 01:35:24.732
- I signed something.
- Was the man in the restaurant there?

01:35:26.676 --> 01:35:30.113
- Fuck!
- Accept your body's resistance.

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:32.490
Let your head answer.

01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:38.454
- Yes.
- That's right. Who is Ellie?

01:35:40.982 --> 01:35:44.419
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?

01:35:44.485 --> 01:35:48.005
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.

01:35:48.072 --> 01:35:51.259
You understand you hold
the keys to this prison?

01:35:51.325 --> 01:35:53.678
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?

01:35:53.745 --> 01:35:55.972
- No.
- Who was it?

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:05.773
You want to let it
out, don't you, David?

01:36:08.050 --> 01:36:10.987
You're about to tell me.

01:36:11.345 --> 01:36:16.951
Tell me what your heart and soul
will not allow you to forget.

01:36:19.854 --> 01:36:22.248
Did you kill Sofia?

01:37:13.407 --> 01:37:15.551
I thought you were a vandal.

01:37:17.619 --> 01:37:20.097
Who are you?

01:37:24.126 --> 01:37:26.186
I'm Sofia.

01:37:27.963 --> 01:37:31.024
You are not Sofia!

01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:36.696
You are not Sofia.

01:37:38.056 --> 01:37:42.244
I'm Sofia. We're going
to be together again.

01:37:43.353 --> 01:37:47.499
You're going to forget about Juliana
and we're going to be together.

01:37:47.566 --> 01:37:50.502
I'm not going to be
afraid of you any more.

01:37:50.569 --> 01:37:53.630
I'll get you a cold
towel. I'll be right back.

01:37:54.656 --> 01:37:56.716
I love you.

01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:17.987
'Pleasure delayer. '

01:38:26.438 --> 01:38:28.540
Sofia?

01:38:46.833 --> 01:38:49.018
I am Sofia.

01:38:55.091 --> 01:38:59.695
I love you. I missed you so much.

01:39:09.021 --> 01:39:11.165
Where were you?

01:39:16.696 --> 01:39:22.510
Forget it. I don't need
to know. It doesn't matter.

01:39:25.413 --> 01:39:27.723
Just tell me that you love me.

01:39:33.087 --> 01:39:35.022
I love you.

01:39:37.466 --> 01:39:40.486
What is happiness to you, David?

01:39:40.594 --> 01:39:43.948
For me, it's being here with you.

01:39:51.021 --> 01:39:54.166
What the fuck is happening?

01:39:57.319 --> 01:39:59.755
What the fuck is happening?

01:39:59.822 --> 01:40:03.425
David was a real delight as a child.

01:40:07.246 --> 01:40:10.599
I'm so afraid of how powerful this is.

01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:14.144
Oh, David.

01:40:32.729 --> 01:40:34.790
Red dress, strappy shoes...

01:40:44.741 --> 01:40:48.178
That is the greatest
thing I have ever heard.

01:40:48.995 --> 01:40:52.224
I'll tell you in another
life when we are both cats.

01:40:58.672 --> 01:41:00.982
What's happening?

01:42:23.965 --> 01:42:26.400
I did it, didn't I?

01:42:28.511 --> 01:42:32.156
But I don't feel like I killed someone.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:40.581
- I feel like I'm in a dream.
- Who was the man at the restaurant?

01:42:59.375 --> 01:43:03.771
Sometimes the mind behaves
as if it were a dream.

01:43:03.837 --> 01:43:07.816
Faces change, people
become other people.

01:43:08.759 --> 01:43:12.446
The subconscious is a powerful thing.

01:43:13.555 --> 01:43:17.409
You treated Julie
carelessly, didn't you?

01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:29.838
Your feelings of responsibility
or guilt over Julie

01:43:29.905 --> 01:43:33.634
might have turned Sofia into Julie.

01:43:36.078 --> 01:43:40.098
- Do you know what derangement is?
- I need your help.

01:43:42.251 --> 01:43:47.230
All I know is you killed your girlfriend
and I don't know what's in your mind.

01:43:47.297 --> 01:43:49.566
I need your help.

01:43:49.633 --> 01:43:54.571
I would work on this case forever if
I could, but we've run out of time.

01:43:59.101 --> 01:44:01.578
What will you plead?

01:44:04.731 --> 01:44:09.669
Temporary derangement.
That's your best chance.

01:44:11.530 --> 01:44:14.007
I don't think they'll believe me.

01:44:15.158 --> 01:44:17.844
Who do you believe?

01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:22.140
Believe it or not, I care about you.

01:44:23.249 --> 01:44:27.979
You've become like family to me.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.861
I don't want to give up on you, David.

01:44:34.928 --> 01:44:39.657
But I needed more. I needed an answer.

01:44:40.517 --> 01:44:43.453
I even thought there was a chance

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.997
somebody was playing a trick on you.

01:44:46.064 --> 01:44:51.169
Maybe it was the board. But
I can't exceed my duties.

01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:59.135
I'm just a psychologist...

01:45:00.244 --> 01:45:02.638
...and I have to go now.

01:45:06.376 --> 01:45:09.270
Will I see you at the trial?

01:45:10.171 --> 01:45:14.567
No, I'm just the opening act.

01:45:34.487 --> 01:45:38.883
'Reassurance is our speciality.
That's the Life Extension creed.

01:45:46.749 --> 01:45:49.602
'Benny the dog was
frozen for three months

01:45:49.668 --> 01:45:52.188
'and thawed out to live a normal life.

01:45:52.254 --> 01:45:56.233
'Life Extension can translate

72 cryonised patients are currently
held at our facility in New Brunswick.

We feature the finest scientific
technicians on the planet.

- The book is "Life, The Sequel".
- McCabe!

01:46:17.196 --> 01:46:19.089
McCabe!

01:46:20.616 --> 01:46:22.759
Come back!

01:46:59.696 --> 01:47:04.843
Life Extension Corporation,
please. LE. We hold a court order.

01:47:07.829 --> 01:47:10.307
I think I've been here before.

01:47:22.844 --> 01:47:26.031
- Her name is Libby.
- Good morning, Mr McCabe.

01:47:26.097 --> 01:47:29.534
I'm Libby. I'm here to assist you.

01:47:31.269 --> 01:47:33.955
He's my son. He's very shy.

01:47:34.022 --> 01:47:38.293
You're not with the media or
part of any legal consortium?

01:47:40.153 --> 01:47:42.297
Welcome to Life Extension.

01:47:42.363 --> 01:47:45.633
Take a look at our
proposal. Please follow me.

01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:48.303
You can wait out here.

01:47:48.369 --> 01:47:52.807
You'll be meeting Rebecca
Dearborn, my personal role model.

01:47:54.834 --> 01:47:57.812
'I didn't need the pain any more. '

01:47:58.922 --> 01:48:01.315
'Life Extension wants you to live. '

01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:07.613
'I don't think that God
disapproves of this. '

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.408
Cryonisation, a journey of reawakening

01:48:10.475 --> 01:48:14.495
after the preservation of the human
body at extremely low temperatures.

01:48:14.562 --> 01:48:17.748
- They laughed at Jules Verne, too.
- David, you are not...

01:48:17.815 --> 01:48:20.751
Mr McCabe, how are you?
I'm Rebecca Dearborn.

01:48:23.863 --> 01:48:28.050
Life Extension, or LE as
we like to refer to it,

01:48:28.117 --> 01:48:33.639
is a glimpse of the future. A
ticket, not in the juvenile sense

01:48:33.706 --> 01:48:38.853
but in the deeply meaningful sense that
can only be borne in the human heart.

01:48:41.172 --> 01:48:44.316
The DNA codes of the human
body have been broken.

01:48:44.383 --> 01:48:49.196
Soon heart ailments, cancer, so much
more will be a thing of the past.

01:48:49.263 --> 01:48:54.034
Very simply, your anguish,
your discontent, even your death

01:48:54.101 --> 01:48:57.329
is no longer necessary
in a traditional sense.

01:48:57.396 --> 01:49:01.709
Whatever malady hides behind
that mask, it's temporary.

01:49:03.110 --> 01:49:08.132
Within an hour of your passing, LE
will transfer your body to a vessel

01:49:08.199 --> 01:49:12.970
where you will be sealed and
frozen at 196 degrees below zero.

01:49:13.037 --> 01:49:17.433
Power outages, earthquakes, nothing
will affect your suspension hibernation.

01:49:17.499 --> 01:49:20.561
Have you signed a contract
with these people, David?

01:49:24.131 --> 01:49:28.110
- What's the Lucid Dream option?
- Good choice.

01:49:28.761 --> 01:49:32.447
The Lucid Dream is Life
Extension's newest option.

01:49:32.514 --> 01:49:34.241
For a little extra,

01:49:34.308 --> 01:49:40.455
we offer the cryonic union
of science and entertainment.

01:49:41.565 --> 01:49:43.333
Cryotainment.

01:49:47.321 --> 01:49:50.424
Some find this presentation helpful.

01:49:57.581 --> 01:50:02.769
<i>I have a universe inside me...</i>

'Life part two. '

01:51:20.038 --> 01:51:22.265
A living dream.

01:51:24.333 --> 01:51:27.770
Your death will be
wiped from your memory.

01:51:27.837 --> 01:51:30.398
I guess I missed that
one in "USA Today".

01:51:30.465 --> 01:51:35.528
A dream. What if there was a mistake?

01:51:36.888 --> 01:51:39.949
What if the dream became a nightmare?

01:51:41.183 --> 01:51:45.788
Your subconscious can
always play tricks on you.

01:51:46.522 --> 01:51:50.209
The subconscious is
a very powerful thing.

01:51:53.487 --> 01:51:56.173
Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:59.635
But this is a serious business.

01:52:00.536 --> 01:52:03.764
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk.

01:52:04.874 --> 01:52:08.769
And what is any life if
not the pursuit of a dream?

01:52:08.836 --> 01:52:13.148
The dream of peace, the
dream of achievement,

01:52:14.383 --> 01:52:17.569
the dream of hearing
someone say these words...

01:52:17.636 --> 01:52:19.989
...when they truly mean them:

01:52:23.017 --> 01:52:25.077
I love you, David.

01:52:27.563 --> 01:52:29.623
- Te quiero.
- I love you.

01:52:29.690 --> 01:52:32.292
<i>And the way the sunlight
plays upon your hair...</i>

01:52:33.694 --> 01:52:38.048
Roam free, David. Most
of us live our whole lives

01:52:38.115 --> 01:52:42.678
without any real
adventure to call our own.

01:52:42.745 --> 01:52:47.349
It's hard to comprehend, but
they laughed at Jules Verne, too.

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:53.605
This is a revolution of the mind.

01:52:53.672 --> 01:52:57.526
<i>I'm picking up good vibrations</i>

01:53:15.610 --> 01:53:19.506
I want to wake up! Tech support!

01:53:23.535 --> 01:53:26.096
It's a nightmare!

01:53:42.846 --> 01:53:45.782
Tech support!

01:54:00.905 --> 01:54:04.050
Tech support!

01:54:40.945 --> 01:54:45.800
David Aames. I think it's time
we had a proper introduction.

01:54:45.867 --> 01:54:49.011
I'm Edmund Ventura
from the Oasis project,

01:54:49.078 --> 01:54:51.514
formerly Life Extension, LE.

01:54:51.581 --> 01:54:55.518
- Tech support?
- Yes, I'm your tech support.

01:54:55.668 --> 01:54:58.854
We first met 150 years ago.

01:54:59.755 --> 01:55:03.776
Shit. You sold me the Lucid Dream.

01:55:05.886 --> 01:55:10.074
- What the hell happened?
- I tried to warn you in the bar, David.

01:55:10.141 --> 01:55:14.328
I told you that it all
depended on your mind.

01:55:14.979 --> 01:55:18.791
All of this, everything
is your creation.

01:55:18.858 --> 01:55:21.794
Now we're heading towards
your true moment of choice.

01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.714
- True moment of choice?
- Yes.

01:55:30.828 --> 01:55:32.888
When did the Lucid Dream begin?

01:55:32.955 --> 01:55:36.350
- Do you remember the night club?
- We'll meet up soon.

01:55:38.168 --> 01:55:41.897
That night, after Sofia left you
and you fell asleep on the pavement,

01:55:41.964 --> 01:55:45.108
that was the moment that
you chose for the splice.

01:55:45.175 --> 01:55:47.861
- Splice?
- Splice.

01:55:47.928 --> 01:55:52.157
The end of your real life and
the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.

01:55:52.224 --> 01:55:54.159
A splice of many years

01:55:54.226 --> 01:55:57.287
which passed while you
were frozen and dreaming.

01:55:57.354 --> 01:55:59.498
From the moment you woke up,

01:55:59.565 --> 01:56:03.335
- nothing was real in the traditional sense.
- Open your eyes.

01:56:03.402 --> 01:56:06.171
Your Lucid Dream is
monitored by Life Extension

01:56:06.238 --> 01:56:09.633
and a panel of experts
following your every thought,

01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:12.469
even at this moment.

01:56:13.578 --> 01:56:15.889
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.

01:56:20.168 --> 01:56:23.188
I'm not a big fan of heights.

01:56:23.422 --> 01:56:25.273
I know.

01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.443
We erased what really
happened from your memory.

01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:30.737
- Erased?
- Replaced...

01:56:30.804 --> 01:56:36.826
...by a better life, under these
beautiful, Monet-like skies.

01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:43.541
- My mother's favourite.
- A better life because you had Sofia.

01:56:44.067 --> 01:56:48.630
You sculpted your Lucid Dream out
of the iconography of your youth.

01:56:48.697 --> 01:56:52.884
- An album cover that once moved you.
- An album cover?

01:56:52.951 --> 01:56:57.472
'There are some things that you're not
old enough to understand just yet. '

01:56:57.539 --> 01:57:01.601
A movie you saw once that showed
you what a father could be like.

01:57:12.178 --> 01:57:14.447
Or what love could be like.

01:57:14.806 --> 01:57:20.661
This was a kind woman, an
individual. More than your equal.

01:57:21.604 --> 01:57:23.331
You barely knew her in your real life,

01:57:23.398 --> 01:57:27.835
but in your Lucid Dream
she was your saviour.

01:57:32.198 --> 01:57:35.510
What happened in my real
life? Something happened.

01:57:35.576 --> 01:57:38.429
- What did you erase?
- Do you really want to know?

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:43.517
Tell me everything.

01:57:43.584 --> 01:57:48.397
The morning after the night club, you
woke up on the street, hungover and alone.

01:57:48.464 --> 01:57:53.778
You got up and you walked
away. You never saw Sofia again.

01:58:00.142 --> 01:58:01.994
I didn't kill Sofia.

01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:05.206
No.

01:58:05.272 --> 01:58:10.461
You battled your board, the Seven
Dwarfs, for control of the company.

01:58:10.528 --> 01:58:13.380
In the end it was Thomas
Tipp, your father's friend,

01:58:13.447 --> 01:58:17.635
who wrenched the company
back into your control.

01:58:19.286 --> 01:58:21.430
Tommy.

01:58:22.414 --> 01:58:24.433
But then...

01:58:24.917 --> 01:58:27.561
...somebody died.

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.524
You longed for Sofia.

01:58:32.591 --> 01:58:36.403
You shut yourself away
for months. You were alone.

01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:39.782
You couldn't stand the pain
any more, the headaches.

01:58:39.848 --> 01:58:44.745
- You could barely function.
- I found you on the Internet.

01:58:48.065 --> 01:58:51.168
I signed a contract with you and then...

01:59:12.673 --> 01:59:14.900
I remember.

01:59:23.642 --> 01:59:25.911
Somebody died.

01:59:27.437 --> 01:59:28.830
It was me.

01:59:36.238 --> 01:59:39.174
'And on a day in late December...

01:59:39.783 --> 01:59:42.802
'... you gave yourself to us.

01:59:43.787 --> 01:59:47.307
'You're now in a suspended state.

01:59:50.669 --> 01:59:55.273
'Your friend Brian Shelby threw a
three-day memorial in your old home.

01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:57.942
'He was a true friend.

02:00:06.768 --> 02:00:09.370
'You were missed, David.

02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:34.645
'Lt was Sofia who never fully recovered.

02:00:35.922 --> 02:00:39.233
'Lt was she who somehow knew you best.

02:00:39.884 --> 02:00:42.862
'Like you, she never
forgot that one night

02:00:42.929 --> 02:00:46.657
'where true love seemed possible.

02:00:54.607 --> 02:00:57.084
'Consequences, David.

02:01:13.542 --> 02:01:15.978
'Lt's the little things. '

02:01:19.799 --> 02:01:22.359
The little things.

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:26.530
There's nothing bigger, is there?

02:01:34.647 --> 02:01:38.542
Your subconscious did create problems.

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:42.546
Your dream turned into a nightmare.

02:01:42.738 --> 02:01:45.924
The glitch has been corrected.

02:01:46.867 --> 02:01:49.720
So all I have to do
is imagine something?

02:01:49.787 --> 02:01:53.932
Like if I wanted McCabe
to come back right now.

02:01:57.461 --> 02:02:01.064
Listen to me. These
people are dangerous.

02:02:02.257 --> 02:02:06.069
We're in trouble. We need
to get off this roof now.

02:02:09.431 --> 02:02:13.744
We're now on pause, and you're
about to return to your Lucid Dream.

02:02:13.810 --> 02:02:15.662
Pause?

02:02:15.729 --> 02:02:20.792
You won't remember any of this, nor will
you be charged for technical support.

02:02:20.859 --> 02:02:24.045
It's now your moment of choice.

02:02:24.363 --> 02:02:29.176
You can return to your Lucid Dream
and live a beautiful life with Sofia

02:02:29.242 --> 02:02:31.845
or whomever you wish.

02:02:31.912 --> 02:02:35.140
Or you can choose the world out there.

02:02:38.668 --> 02:02:40.020
The world out there?

02:02:40.796 --> 02:02:44.983
And you can bring me back?
Just like Benny the dog?

02:02:45.091 --> 02:02:48.653
Yes, just like Benny the dog.

02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:52.949
Your face and body can be fixed now,

02:02:54.059 --> 02:02:59.748
but things are very different now.
And your finances won't last long.

02:03:01.232 --> 02:03:05.462
Your panel of observers are
waiting for you to choose.

02:03:09.407 --> 02:03:14.846
There are no guarantees. But
remember, even in the future,

02:03:14.913 --> 02:03:19.559
the sweet is never as
sweet without the sour.

02:03:38.353 --> 02:03:42.290
- How do I wake up?
- The decision is yours.

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:50.756
I chose this scenario, didn't I?

02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:56.262
Yes, to face your last
remaining fear of heights.

02:03:56.329 --> 02:03:58.306
David, don't listen to him.

02:03:58.372 --> 02:04:01.309
This is the Seven
Dwarfs. It's a set-up!

02:04:01.375 --> 02:04:04.145
You can't trust him.

02:04:04.212 --> 02:04:08.065
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.

02:04:08.132 --> 02:04:11.068
It's in his nature to
fight for his existence,

02:04:11.135 --> 02:04:13.988
- but he's not real.
- I'm real.

02:04:16.724 --> 02:04:20.494
I'm real. I have two daughters.

02:04:20.561 --> 02:04:22.496
You know that.

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:24.790
What are their names?

02:04:39.747 --> 02:04:41.473
I'm real.

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:44.727
I'm...

02:04:47.296 --> 02:04:52.234
Mortality as home entertainment?
This cannot be the future!

02:04:53.927 --> 02:04:55.988
Can it?

02:04:57.014 --> 02:04:59.158
Can it?

02:05:26.918 --> 02:05:28.478
Goodbye.

02:05:31.631 --> 02:05:38.405
It's been a journey of self-awakening.
Now you've got to ask yourself this.

02:05:38.472 --> 02:05:40.949
What is happiness to you, David?

02:05:47.981 --> 02:05:50.875
I want to live a real life.

02:05:51.443 --> 02:05:53.837
I don't want to dream any longer.

02:05:54.863 --> 02:05:56.965
Any last wishes?

02:05:59.701 --> 02:06:03.221
Let them out there read my mind.

02:06:04.164 --> 02:06:06.766
I wish you well, David.

02:06:46.164 --> 02:06:50.768
Look at us. I'm frozen and you're dead.

02:06:51.586 --> 02:06:53.729
And I love you.

02:06:55.089 --> 02:06:57.525
It's a problem.

02:07:00.553 --> 02:07:05.074
I lost you when I got
in that car. I'm sorry.

02:07:07.852 --> 02:07:10.621
Do you remember what you told me once?

02:07:11.564 --> 02:07:14.208
Every passing minute

02:07:14.942 --> 02:07:18.462
is another chance to turn it all around.

02:07:23.451 --> 02:07:25.928
I'll find you again.

02:07:41.927 --> 02:07:44.655
I'll see you in another life...

02:07:44.722 --> 02:07:46.782
...when we are both cats.

02:08:59.170 --> 02:09:02.273
'Relax, David. Open your eyes. '
