WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:03.671
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.836 --> 00:05.510
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:08.892
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.051 --> 00:11.270
<i>Today I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:13.772
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its Mayor.</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:16.024
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:17.935
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:20.654
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:22.359
Previously on Arrow...

00:22.523 --> 00:24.116
Former Police Captain, Quentin Lance.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.197
Who'll be serving beside me
as Deputy Mayor.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.783
Appreciate the vote of confidence,
Mr. Mayor.

00:28.946 --> 00:32.540
- Are you not from Star City?
- No. Havenrock.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.702
<i>There's something
that I need you to know.</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:37.291
Havenrock was not the intended target.

00:37.454 --> 00:41.004
Someone redirected the missile
to reduce the number of casualties.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.168
That someone was me.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.635
- Ever since I killed Andy...
- You think you need to be punished.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.266
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.644
We need to talk about John. He's back
in the country. And he's in prison.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.180
And I need you to break him out.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.769
<i>Come on, Mr. Olympia. Hustle up.</i>

01:00.936 --> 01:05.032
Mr. Olympia is a bodybuilding competition.
I was... Am an Olympic athlete.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.613
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.119
<i>Very funny.
And it was a bronze medal.</i>

01:09.278 --> 01:10.404
<i>Why is that so hard to remember?</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:13.245
Quiet. Every time you're out in the field,
you could die.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.627
Don't forget that. Don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.503
Headed towards the east exit,
closing fast.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.335
- Do we know what he stole?
- Not yet.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.170
But I have a feeling
we're about to find out.

01:22.332 --> 01:26.007
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.388
Does this mean
I actually get to shoot someone?

01:28.547 --> 01:31.721
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone,
shoot someone. I just meant more that...

01:31.883 --> 01:34.386
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon,

01:34.553 --> 01:36.647
- then engage. Do you copy?
- Copy.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.935
- Copy.
- Copy. Still a lot of ground to cover.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.944
Rag should be here.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.276
Overwatch, do you have
a 20 on Ragman?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.659
I texted him, like, 10 times,
and then 10 more, but nada.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.320
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.533
And by the looks of those rags,

01:52.696 --> 01:54.198
he does not hit the dry cleaner
very often.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.623
- Hola, muchacho.
- Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.

02:02.789 --> 02:06.043
I got him. What the...

02:10.047 --> 02:11.594
<i>I</i> got him.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.130
What did I say? That was Artemis' shot!

02:52.297 --> 02:54.675
- Dude was getting away.
- No, he wasn't.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.684
And you missed.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.767
You were in the Navy,
you should know better.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.479
I was dishonorably discharged, actually.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.268
Do you think that I don't know that?

03:07.312 --> 03:11.488
Deliver that and the evidence
to the Anti-Crime Unit and then go home.

03:13.318 --> 03:17.448
- What about tonight's training session?
- You're taking a few days off.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.583
Nice going. Again.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.670
How we supposed to get this guy
to the ACU? Call an Uber?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.104
Oliver?

03:42.597 --> 03:46.477
The op's over and you've been MIA
for days. It's not acceptable.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.237
Get it together immediately,
or you're off the team.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.649
That's why I'm here,
to tell you in person.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.197
I'm off the team.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.987
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.781
I thought you were just getting started.

03:58.947 --> 04:03.123
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth
about her role in Havenrock.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.499
You didn't know she told me.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.836
Did she also tell you that she was faced
with an impossible choice?

04:08.999 --> 04:10.501
I completely realize that.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.177
I get it wasn't her fault.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.130
But that doesn't change
the fact that every time I look at her,

04:15.297 --> 04:17.220
I see the faces of my family,

04:17.382 --> 04:19.259
of everyone I ever loved.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.521
Felicity is a constant reminder
of what I lost.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.149
And as long as that's true, I'm sorry,
I can't be here.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.272
What about your father?

04:29.186 --> 04:31.154
I thought he was the reason
you were doing this.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.529
I'll have to find another way
to honor him.

04:37.736 --> 04:41.036
- I'm sorry to lose you.
- And I'm sorry to go.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.121
Thank you. For everything.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.290
Did my comms deceive me,

04:49.456 --> 04:51.834
or did you actually let the recruits take
an SCPD victory lap?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.252
It's never a victory lap.

04:53.418 --> 04:57.264
They're rough around the edges,
but they're making progress.

04:57.547 --> 05:01.302
Except Rory, who was waiting for me
upstairs to say that he quit.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.972
He said you spoke with him
about Havenrock.

05:08.683 --> 05:09.980
<i>He'!-</i>

05:10.227 --> 05:13.777
- How you holding up?
- She doesn't know?

05:13.939 --> 05:16.567
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me. I'm so sorry.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.909
What Lyla means...
We are going to break him out.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.536
- Of military prison?
- Yeah.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.996
Wait, and then what? John is just
a fugitive for the rest of his life?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.753
Better than being punished for something
he didn't do.

05:29.746 --> 05:33.125
Well, I've been studying the schematics
that you hooked me up with.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.386
This would be a lot easier
if we had John's cooperation.

05:36.545 --> 05:37.922
You don't have what now?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.511
Apparently prison
is more appealing to John

05:40.674 --> 05:42.221
than coming home
to his own wife and child.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.887
Okay, so wait a minute. Not only do you
want to commit multiple felonies,

05:45.053 --> 05:48.398
and make John a wanted man for the rest of
his life, he doesn't actually want you to?

05:48.557 --> 05:51.356
- Can I speak with you for a minute?
- Yeah.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.865
- Is she going to be a problem?
- No.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.118
But I was counting on her being a help.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.200
Maybe I should pull
a few of my agents in on this.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.707
Lyla, if this has your fingerprints on it,

06:05.866 --> 06:09.040
then both of John, Jr.'s parents
will be fugitives.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.048
There is something that might actually
make this not impossible.

06:13.206 --> 06:17.507
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece
of tech, an anti-molecular compound.

06:19.004 --> 06:22.133
I was kind of hoping Felicity
could help us get our hands on it...

06:22.299 --> 06:24.097
Lyla. Whatever it is, I'll handle it.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.607
Second test over.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.527
Do not make any worse
by pulling out sutures.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.983
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva
treat their new members,

06:36.146 --> 06:37.819
I'd hate to see
how they treat their enemies.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.779
Pass third and final test, find out.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.782
- What's the test?
- You keep asking about Kovar.

06:44.279 --> 06:48.034
Our sources say this man
will get you one step closer.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.078
You have to act fast though.
He will be arraigned in morning.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.088
- Arraigned?
- Jail.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.922
Yeah.
But what makes you think he'll talk to me?

06:58.209 --> 07:01.008
You trust me. I trust you.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.974
It's a little early for a drink,
don't you think?

07:05.467 --> 07:06.844
Is not for drinking.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.025
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?

07:37.666 --> 07:41.091
I should probably just start pre-recording
apologies for being late.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.677
Don't worry. Thea told us. I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.095
Yes, it is.

07:46.257 --> 07:49.887
I'm actually going to be taking some
time off to have it taken care of.

07:50.553 --> 07:55.024
Well, fortunately, we now have
a Deputy Mayor to help pick up the slack.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.153
It'll be great working with you. You've
had an impressive career, Mr. Lance.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.821
Yeah. I mean, a lot of people out there

08:00.021 --> 08:02.274
probably wouldn't share that opinion,
but thank you.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.029
Public service isn't easy.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.532
Sometimes you get a little dirty
clearing out the filth.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.789
Speaking of which,
I heard there was an arrest last night

08:08.947 --> 08:10.915
that may help
in our case against Tobias Church?

08:11.074 --> 08:14.954
Sergio Espinosa. Long-time Los Halcones
member turned Church strong man.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.748
The Green Arrow
and his merry band of vigilantes

08:17.914 --> 08:19.882
left him giftwrapped for us at Anti-Crime.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.839
The only thing that was missing was a bow.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.973
- You don't sound too happy about that.
- Vigilantes are a superficial solution.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.849
If we need their help
to get our streets clean...

08:28.008 --> 08:30.227
It means we haven't done our jobs right.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.934
Do you think that you can get Espinosa
to flip on Church?

08:34.264 --> 08:36.107
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.984
Make sure he doesn't get any help
from crooked cops.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.144
Not a chance.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.938
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence
in the custody chain through myself.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.858
Good. Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.904
Be my eyes and ears while I'm out of town.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.447
Sure. Give us a little bit of time
to get acquainted.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.698
Hmm.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.534
- Great.
- Yeah.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.796
Um...

08:57.996 --> 09:01.296
Sorry, when did, uh, babysitting evidence
become part of the job description?

09:01.583 --> 09:02.835
Since I trust you.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.923
You do?

09:05.462 --> 09:06.679
I mean, all things considered...

09:06.838 --> 09:10.468
If we didn't think you were right for the
job, we wouldn't have offered it to you.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.927
Right?

09:12.927 --> 09:15.521
I haven't had a drink in a week, okay?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.770
Where the hell are you going, anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.152
You should probably assume
that it's not a vacation.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.649
Should I even ask?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.527
No. I'm not gonna be gone long.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.819
Just please make sure that no one
destroys the city while I'm away.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.071
- Sure.
- Okay.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.209
- What are you doing?
- Reviewing the SCPD evidence log

09:36.367 --> 09:39.337
on what we kept from getting stolen from
Kord Industries last night.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.756
- A 6800 processor.
- So?

09:41.915 --> 09:46.091
Exactly. Kord manufactures bleeding-edge
tech, military-grade weapons.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.256
I mean,
all kinds of city-threatening items.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.802
Why would Church send a guy to steal
a computer chip

09:52.967 --> 09:54.844
that you could buy
from any Tech Village store?

09:55.220 --> 09:58.019
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lock-up now.

09:58.223 --> 10:02.228
Well, because knowing what
Church's endgame was is like...

10:02.560 --> 10:05.530
It's like this thing that's
still out there. Lurking.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.109
You all right over there?

10:09.275 --> 10:13.030
Because I've been doing a lot of talking
and you haven't.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.619
Which is very weird.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.579
You know how you
told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?

10:20.745 --> 10:23.544
Yeah? Oh, he's not sick
with the flu, is he?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.216
No. He's just

10:26.334 --> 10:27.711
sick of working with me.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.925
Did you try talking to him?

10:30.547 --> 10:33.221
There's not a lot I can say
that would make him feel okay

10:33.424 --> 10:35.222
about his entire family being killed.

10:38.221 --> 10:41.316
Incoming. Another robbery in progress at...

10:41.474 --> 10:43.351
Palmer Tech. Gotta call Oliver.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.566
Or maybe don't
and we just let them get robbed.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.403
It'll serve Mr. Dennis right
for firing us.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.619
- He fired me. You quit.
- Because he fired you. Same thing.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.076
<i>Hey, Sanchez,
you got anything?</i>

10:56.239 --> 10:57.240
Nada.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.580
<i>Okay, I'll kill the alarm.</i>

11:25.059 --> 11:26.151
What's up?

11:26.311 --> 11:29.485
Hey, there's been a break-in
at Palmer Tech. Are you still in the area?

11:29.814 --> 11:32.112
Uh, yeah. I can look into that.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.743
How was Palmer Tech?

11:41.910 --> 11:44.584
<i>Before you answer, you should consider
that your phone has GPS.</i>

11:44.746 --> 11:48.091
And if you were thinking of lying,
I do admire your consistency.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.969
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.

11:52.128 --> 11:56.383
I wasn't looping you in after you made it
clear you didn't approve of the decision.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.971
John is the one
who doesn't approve of the plan.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.387
- John is not thinking clearly.
- Well, I bet Roy is.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.100
And if he were here,
I think he would tell you

12:02.263 --> 12:04.311
that life on the run is no life at all.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.522
And I seem to remember you not being
on board with that plan.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.272
Roy was making a bad choice.
Just like John is making a bad choice.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.701
He is currently locked up in a military
prison for a crime he didn't commit.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.780
To atone for a crime that he did commit.
And what does it matter?

12:17.946 --> 12:19.744
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.704
Why do you always have to go
and make decisions for him?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.539
He already abandoned the team.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.703
Lam not going to let him
abandon his family.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.123
Is that what this is about?
John leaving the team?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.836
This is simple.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.763
Lam gonna stop John from making
a decision he will come to regret.

12:34.921 --> 12:39.597
You should consider doing
the exact same thing with Rory.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.932
You do realize that me having
a chat with Rory

12:42.095 --> 12:46.020
is completely different than you
committing half a dozen felonies, right?

12:46.683 --> 12:49.357
Did you ever think you'd be doing
this again? Handling evidence?

12:49.519 --> 12:52.773
No. Didn't think I'd be
Deputy Mayor either, but here we are.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.317
I was surprised you took the job,
to be honest.

12:55.525 --> 12:59.530
From what I hear, you and Queen
have a, uh, complicated history.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.490
Gotta be a lot of hatchets to bury there.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.706
Yeah, well,
at least I know where they're buried.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.666
That's something you can't buy or steal.

13:12.250 --> 13:16.096
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor too.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.762
Ah, bonus. Get ready to move.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.400
Let me guess. Felicity filled you in.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.907
That you're going to break
into a military prison, yeah.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.113
And you got the nerve to call me
"Wild Dog."

13:38.276 --> 13:39.744
- I'm done debating this.
<i>- Really?</i>

13:39.902 --> 13:42.872
Because this is the first we've heard
of it. I thought we were your team.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.830
Running off to bust someone out of
prison sounds like team business.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.336
And what happens to us
when you get caught?

13:48.494 --> 13:51.213
You've made it clear that we can't do
this vigilante thing without you.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.420
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.927
Right.
Because we're not gonna let you do this.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.430
I'm sorry.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.185
Did you say that you're not gonna
"let" me?

14:06.179 --> 14:09.058
Yes. I need to see you physically
deposit the item.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.976
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.

14:12.143 --> 14:15.568
Now, relax, Sergeant. No one's doubting
your proficiency here. Okay?

14:18.149 --> 14:19.776
Seems like.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.289
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?

14:32.455 --> 14:34.002
Have at it.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.641
What the...

14:51.849 --> 14:53.066
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get out of here!

15:08.074 --> 15:09.075
Whoo!

15:11.828 --> 15:13.626
Find the weapons, boys.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.624
<i>Ah.</i>

15:20.378 --> 15:23.006
Sorry, gents. Load them up!

15:24.006 --> 15:26.304
And burn this puppy down.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.684
Let's go, let's go. Get out! Go!

15:36.727 --> 15:38.195
Okay.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.024
Last chance.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.034
Get off the street.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.455
Oh!

16:07.008 --> 16:09.477
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.433
You know what really sucks?

16:11.596 --> 16:13.439
Realizing that
in all those training sessions

16:13.598 --> 16:15.566
where he was kicking our respective asses,
the whole time

16:15.725 --> 16:17.227
he was taking it easy on us.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.067
Yeah, remind me to never,
ever get on his bad side.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.569
I think that would imply
that he has a good side.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.703
And you know, Felicity, could you please
explain to me again

16:26.861 --> 16:29.535
how you thought
this was all gonna go down?

16:29.697 --> 16:34.077
I thought if he saw you guys all united
against his crazy plan, he'd reconsider.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.463
Right, because Oliver Queen is known
for thinking things through

16:37.622 --> 16:38.919
and taking input from others.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.458
<i>Right.</i>

16:42.418 --> 16:43.419
Wow.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.344
- The ever-expanding clubhouse.
- And who are you?

16:47.548 --> 16:50.768
- I'm Thea. Oliver's chief of staff.
- And also his sister.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.935
- Don't tell me, Oliver beat you up too.
- Wait, Ollie did this?

16:55.097 --> 16:58.271
Object lesson. Long story. It's fine.
Don't ask. What happened to you?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.357
Tobias Church happened.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.861
That "evidence" that you guys recovered
from Kord Industries?

17:04.022 --> 17:08.574
- Modified to go boom.
- He wanted it to be put into lockup.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.290
He wanted to raid it.
That's one-stop shopping for weapons.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.792
Including those RPGs that he took from
AmerTek, if this report's right.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.000
We gotta find out what he's planning
to do with those weapons

17:18.162 --> 17:19.664
'cause it ain't nothing good.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.877
This is a really bad time for Oliver
to be out of town.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.760
Yeah. Just tried him. He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?

17:24.919 --> 17:27.172
We wanna figure out what Church is up to
before it's too late.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.715
- You sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.142
I don't think Oliver would want us
out there without him.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.179
Right. Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion
when he left.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.315
Okay. But this is
an "all hands on deck" situation.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.976
Rag-covered hands included. Just saying.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.207
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.

17:55.366 --> 17:59.416
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.711
I don't see you on the list.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.009
Your C.O. should have submitted
a change of personnel form.

18:05.251 --> 18:09.301
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.467
Can't you refresh your WiFi or something?

18:14.385 --> 18:17.355
There you are. As you were, Private.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.685
Thank you, sir.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.677
I'm in.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.648
Twenty-five minutes till extraction.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.729
Roger that.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.569
Facility's cameras
are on a closed network.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.280
If you can get me access to the mainframe,
I can open it up.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.911
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.617
If you don't make it
to the extraction point...

19:15.780 --> 19:17.623
I'll make it. And I won't be alone.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.225
Hey, do you speak English?

19:42.098 --> 19:43.190
Yes.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.611
Your accent, you're American?

19:48.104 --> 19:51.108
Yeah, maybe once upon a time.

19:51.691 --> 19:56.618
But now I'm more just enjoying
everything that Russia has to offer.

19:56.821 --> 19:59.700
Yes, I can smell that.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.867
<i>W W“ Midge me...</i>

20:03.244 --> 20:04.666
You're in this cell, too.

20:05.162 --> 20:08.382
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.419
You mean Konstantin Kovar?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.008
How do you know that name?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.889
You know, the same that way that I know
you're name's Pyotr Friedkin.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.267
Same way I know that
you launder money for Kovar.

20:18.426 --> 20:22.181
- Same way that I know...
- That's what you're doing here.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.437
How can you know that? Unless...

20:29.145 --> 20:30.237
Are you Bratva?

20:32.940 --> 20:33.941
Huh?

20:39.905 --> 20:41.498
He's fine.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.164
Hmm. Hmm.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.374
I am Bratva.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.920
And you are going to tell me
everything that I want to know.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.892
Your turn to run systems check.
I'm gonna hit the hay.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.677
Don't touch my ball.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.875
Dude. What the hell?

21:34.168 --> 21:36.045
Transponder's in place.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.383
Roger that. I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.

21:49.767 --> 21:53.021
Hey! Hey, is this a bad time?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.071
Do I want to even ask how you found me?

21:58.567 --> 22:00.410
I feel like that's a trick question.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.997
Sorry about the mess.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.492
Wow.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.248
These are amazing!

22:08.577 --> 22:10.671
You spend enough time
with other people's castoffs,

22:10.871 --> 22:12.919
you find ways
to make something useful out of them.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.379
My father always used to say that.

22:14.750 --> 22:18.254
- He owned a pawn shop.
- On Southmoor Road, right?

22:20.089 --> 22:21.591
How did you know?

22:22.633 --> 22:26.228
Last week, you told Oliver that you had
joined the team to honor your father.

22:26.387 --> 22:27.889
When you quit,

22:28.764 --> 22:30.687
I wanted to find out more
about what you were giving up.

22:31.767 --> 22:36.398
Your father was a Gulf War veteran.
2nd Battalion, 1st Marines.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.035
But that's not what made him a hero,
was it?

22:41.777 --> 22:43.120
No.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.080
He wore your rags.

22:45.739 --> 22:50.119
Like his father before him,
whose name was also Rory.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.839
That's a big legacy to live up to.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.002
Mine is going to be
what happened to Havenrock.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.013
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that.</i>

23:01.255 --> 23:02.677
Every day for the rest of my life,

23:02.840 --> 23:04.763
knowing that I cannot fix it.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.850
And knowing that it's not the last mistake
that I'm ever gonna have to make.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.271
- I still don't know if I can...
- Work <i>side by side</i>

23:12.433 --> 23:14.481
<i>with someone who's a reminder
of what you lost.</i>

23:14.768 --> 23:15.940
I understand.

23:16.145 --> 23:20.321
Just like you're a reminder of what I did.
And I know they're not the same thing.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.533
We both want the same thing,
to be able to live with what's happened

23:24.695 --> 23:27.323
so that we can move forward.

23:35.456 --> 23:36.503
It's Curtis.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.344
I am so sorry.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.680
And we could really use you.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.009
I wish I could, Felicity. I just...

23:49.219 --> 23:51.438
I can't right now. I'm sorry.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.691
If you change your mind, well, we're here.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.032
<i>Cell 1138.</i>

24:02.191 --> 24:03.989
Right side, third from the left.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.870
- Harbinger, he's not here.
- Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.589
- Oh, no.
- What?

24:17.206 --> 24:19.504
They moved him into Gen Pop.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.795
You go in there,
neither of you are getting out.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.730
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?

24:35.057 --> 24:36.104
Outside our window.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.310
<i>Those MPs wake up, the first thing
they're gonna do is move John</i>

24:38.477 --> 24:41.196
and all the other prisoners to a more
secure location and we lose our shot.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.408
Abort. We're blown.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.197
Tell me where I can find Kovar.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.874
- You think you scare me more than him?
- No.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.957
But he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.792
You wouldn't kill me
in front of all of them.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.929
I'm not going to lay a finger on you.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.724
Same can't be said for Alisa.

25:10.384 --> 25:14.480
Or maybe I'll visit your wife, Maya,
when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.686
Somebody is gonna die.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.693
It could be Kovar, it can be your wife,
it can be your child,

25:19.852 --> 25:23.857
but I need you to choose
and do it quickly.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.025
Kovar is very paranoid. Careful.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.286
We never meet in person, only remotely.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.822
Remotely how?

25:33.532 --> 25:37.082
- A digital dead drop. The dark web.
- What's the IP address?

25:37.244 --> 25:38.837
What is the IP address?

25:39.121 --> 25:41.499
108.166.7.161.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.384
If this information is incorrect,
your family will suffer.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.966
How does an American become this?

25:47.629 --> 25:48.972
This...

25:50.340 --> 25:52.889
- Bratva devil.
- I don't know.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.004
About time, blondie. Can we go now?

26:24.166 --> 26:27.466
First of all, not my name. Second, were
you able to locate Church on your recon?

26:27.628 --> 26:30.381
No, but street cams actually picked
him up, so we know he's on the move.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.424
We just don't know where he's moving to.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.060
<i>We can't go after Church
without knowing his endgame first.</i>

26:35.219 --> 26:37.187
Sounds like an excuse to sit around
and do nothing.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.644
- What are you doing?
- Not nothing.

26:39.807 --> 26:44.358
You're cross-plotting Church's prior
locations into a projection algorithm.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.023
You probably got beat up
in grade school a lot.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.025
- And junior high.
- Okay, based on Church's route,

26:50.192 --> 26:53.662
I'm calculating an 86% likelihood
he's going to 18 Mill Road.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.700
- Why does that sound so familiar?
- Because we were just there.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.038
To hand over Sergio.

27:00.702 --> 27:04.377
It's where the ACU is bunkered.
Church is going to take them out.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.435
Montes, quit screwing around.

27:26.770 --> 27:30.400
Station Chief, this is Gans in Cell
Block C. We have a code yellow situation.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.410
Initiate immediate lockdown,
have all prisoners return to their cells.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.118
I'm not rolling on Church.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.578
You think you scare me more than him?

27:43.203 --> 27:44.830
Hmm.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.587
No.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.761
But he's not here with you.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.598
Lam.

27:58.093 --> 28:02.098
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.

28:02.264 --> 28:05.393
Nah, haven't you heard?

28:07.603 --> 28:11.278
All of the justice in this city
comes from vigilantes.

28:11.440 --> 28:15.161
Word on the street is,
is that Church is planning something.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.199
Something big.

28:17.946 --> 28:22.167
You tell me what it is, then he'll be
the one in those cuffs instead of you.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.174
You're talking about the Trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.

28:29.291 --> 28:32.090
Can't even come close.

28:36.173 --> 28:39.677
What the hell's going on? Church?

28:46.475 --> 28:48.477
At least we definitely know
where Church is now.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.817
D'Angelo is right. We gotta put him down.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.779
Against that? Without Oliver?
No, we're short-handed as it is.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.694
- You scared?
- No.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.537
But I'm not stupid either.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.993
Evie's right. I'm not sending you
out there just to get slaughtered.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.328
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.034
You saw what you're up against, okay?

29:04.243 --> 29:06.996
This isn't some drill where you take down
a petty thug or a drug dealer.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.541
This is real. And with real stakes.
The three of you could die out there.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.836
<i>That's something we get to decide
for ourselves, isn't it?</i>

29:14.002 --> 29:18.508
I mean, I don't know about everyone else,
but I didn't join this team to stay safe.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.935
Okay, why don't we take a vote?

29:22.344 --> 29:24.517
- All those in favor...
- We're all gonna say yes, blondie.

29:24.846 --> 29:29.067
God. Not my name!
Good. Okay. Go. Do not die.

29:33.689 --> 29:37.444
<i>Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.</i>

29:38.652 --> 29:42.577
<i>Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.</i>

29:52.582 --> 29:56.257
- Hey, John. What's new?
- I'm not doing this. I told Lyla.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.889
Yeah. You can yell at us later,
but right now we're on a bit of a clock.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.721
Are you even hearing me, right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.806
The MPs going to do a count
in a few minutes. My guess

30:03.969 --> 30:05.937
is there're only expecting
to find one person in here.

30:06.096 --> 30:08.315
Really? So that's your plan? Blackmail?

30:08.473 --> 30:10.567
Do what you say
or you get caught in here too?

30:10.726 --> 30:13.354
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.444
Oliver, I killed my brother.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.443
I went to the Army to change,
and I haven't changed.

30:19.609 --> 30:22.078
I know, all right?

30:22.237 --> 30:24.239
And I know that you think
this is your penance for that...

30:24.406 --> 30:26.750
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.703
Even when you told me not to.
I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.

30:29.870 --> 30:33.124
I need you. The team needs you.
The city needs you.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.760
I'm not saying you shouldn't do
your penance. You probably should.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.966
But do it as Spartan.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.597
What's in the box?

30:46.303 --> 30:49.307
It's an anti-molecular compound,
and theoretically,

30:49.473 --> 30:51.851
it should eat through anything.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.440
I'm not going to ask
how you got your hands on this.

30:55.979 --> 31:00.610
Hey, you came back for me,
even against my wishes.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.453
I guess I haven't changed
that much either.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.621
Maybe that's what I have to do
my penance for.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.585
That toy of yours is definitely coming
in handy.

31:18.752 --> 31:21.096
Project that Lyla's been keeping
an eye on for A.R.G.U.S.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.756
Should have known
that she'd be helping out.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.472
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.682
<i>Follow the sublevel north for
200 meters... </i>

31:27.844 --> 31:29.266
<i>...then climb up.</i>

31:31.556 --> 31:34.776
- What is it?
- Comms are being jammed.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.569
Go! Go! Go!

31:39.815 --> 31:42.238
Hey, is there another way out of here?

31:42.859 --> 31:44.861
You mind uncuffing me
before they kill you?

31:46.321 --> 31:47.493
Hey.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.971
Hey. If that's for taking out the wall,

32:03.130 --> 32:05.383
the blast will kill us
before we can get out. We're in too tight.

32:05.549 --> 32:08.849
- Trust me.
- Yeah. Says the creepy-looking...

32:09.010 --> 32:12.389
- What the hell are you, anyways?
- I'm in place. Blow it.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.037
Sorry we blew up your building. Come on!

32:32.909 --> 32:35.879
- We're goin' up.
- Then what?

32:58.518 --> 33:00.270
Which way, Overwatch?

33:00.437 --> 33:02.735
Take a right at the end of that hallway,
it should be a fire exit.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.572
You through there, you're home free. Easy.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.329
Not so easy.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.243
Rag! Cover me.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.254
Go, go: go'

33:28.757 --> 33:29.929
Let's go!

33:36.348 --> 33:38.225
- It's okay.
- Help me get him up.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.984
Come on.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.866
I probably should just shoot you, but...

33:47.692 --> 33:49.945
But you've earned a little suffering.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.248
- Get him to safety.
- But...

33:57.410 --> 33:59.412
- Go!
- Come on.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.063
Hey, don't kill him.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.112
He may have his uses.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.987
- We've to go back for Wild Dog
- Copy. Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.

34:29.150 --> 34:32.154
- We could use some help.
- Inbound. Hold on.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.239
Get in!

34:36.866 --> 34:39.790
- Where's the Wild Dog kid?
- Still inside. Fighting Church.

34:39.953 --> 34:41.079
We've gotta go back for him.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.248
No, unless you all want to die,
we to go now. Now!

34:43.415 --> 34:44.667
We can't just leave him!

34:44.833 --> 34:46.960
- You have to. Go.
- Come on!

34:51.214 --> 34:53.012
- Here.
- What's this?

34:53.174 --> 34:54.891
Put it on.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.389
Let's go.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.363
Digg, your harness.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.698
You two, freeze!

35:12.986 --> 35:15.535
Down on the ground.
Lace your fingers behind your head!

35:15.697 --> 35:16.994
<i>Do it now or we will shoot.</i>

35:18.366 --> 35:19.709
John, don't move.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.228
This place should keep you off the grid
for the time being.

35:38.386 --> 35:42.266
- Until we find a permanent solution.
- Hey, first things first...

35:43.558 --> 35:44.559
Mmm.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.233
I can't believe you broke me
out of prison.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.239
- For better or worse, Johnny.
- Told you I want to stay.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.693
And I figured if you wanted
to make your own decisions,

35:52.859 --> 35:54.327
then you wouldn't have gotten married.

36:04.371 --> 36:07.716
Okay. How mad was Felicity
that you went along with this?

36:08.041 --> 36:09.588
How do you know
she thought it was a bad idea?

36:10.168 --> 36:11.636
I know Felicity.

36:14.756 --> 36:16.258
What's wrong?

36:17.425 --> 36:19.348
- I have to go.
- Hey.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.606
When you said you haven't changed?

36:24.933 --> 36:25.934
Don't.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.619
How was first night in Russian prison?

36:44.828 --> 36:48.253
Friedkin gave up the dead drop and now
he's dead. Mission accomplished.

36:48.832 --> 36:53.303
- You are being sarcasm, yes?
- That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.302
He didn't deserve to die.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.842
In Bratva, there is no death
without purpose.

36:59.008 --> 37:02.808
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar,

37:02.971 --> 37:05.815
his information not so good.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.148
You know, maybe you could have explained
that to me before you sent me in there.

37:10.437 --> 37:11.859
I almost didn't kill him.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.949
But you did. Why?

37:15.567 --> 37:16.989
Because you told me to.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.658
You trust us.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.585
Now we trust you.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.588
Third test over.

37:30.457 --> 37:31.583
You get it?

37:32.959 --> 37:35.883
You are Bratva now. Family.

37:52.187 --> 37:56.192
Last handful of honest cops in the city
and Church nearly took 'em out.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.156
- Along with me.
- We're just glad you're all right.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.038
I've gotta be thinking
this is a PR nightmare,

38:02.197 --> 38:04.825
something like this going down
and the Mayor's MIA.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.665
Look, he called in this morning.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.505
His health problems are almost over.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.211
That's good news.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.967
We're hearing that one of
the, uh, vigilantes

38:15.126 --> 38:18.130
who was part of the rescue,
that he didn't make it out.

38:18.963 --> 38:23.093
- Um, any word on him?
- CSU hasn't found a body, so...

38:23.802 --> 38:24.849
So Church has him.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.557
I've spent most of my life thinking
that men in masks

38:28.723 --> 38:31.772
were only capable of doing
horrible things.

38:32.769 --> 38:35.022
I may have to reevaluate that.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.567
- Let me know when Queen gets in.
- Will do.

38:42.529 --> 38:43.951
Are you all right?

38:44.239 --> 38:46.583
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
I barely knew the kid, Thea.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.915
Well, doesn't make it sting any less.

38:50.787 --> 38:54.212
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is easy.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.422
I mean, cold as that sounds.

38:58.002 --> 39:02.007
Look, I know why you're asking, okay?
And I'm... I'm fine.

39:02.632 --> 39:03.929
Okay.

39:04.425 --> 39:07.099
I mean, I'm just saying.

39:08.137 --> 39:11.107
If things ever get less easy,

39:12.225 --> 39:13.477
you know I'm here for you, right?

39:14.811 --> 39:15.903
Noted.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.147
And appreciated.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.358
Okay.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.288
What is the point of having
keyhole satellite imagery

39:26.447 --> 39:27.994
if you can't use it to find anybody?

39:28.157 --> 39:31.036
Feel like I don't understand half
the sentences you say.

39:31.202 --> 39:36.049
What I'm saying is that no matter how
hard I try, I cannot find Rene anywhere.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.553
I was the one who told you guys
to leave him behind.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.849
Sounds like another impossible decision.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.972
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better
at making them?

39:50.179 --> 39:52.227
I'm saying you were right.

39:53.182 --> 39:56.937
If we're going to do this,
we can't let guilt swallow us up.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.273
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise
the same for me.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.534
Deal.

40:07.780 --> 40:08.781
Ow.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.993
Ow. Ow.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.164
So, "Ow," then?

40:15.330 --> 40:18.630
Things have really fallen apart
without Oliver, haven't they?

40:18.791 --> 40:20.168
It's a good thing I'm back, then.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.555
Was he waiting for an entrance line?

40:23.713 --> 40:25.841
Nope. He's just that cool.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.636
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?

40:30.720 --> 40:31.846
You get John?

40:32.972 --> 40:36.226
Yeah. He's fine. He's holed up at HIVE.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.528
I couldn't write him off.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.363
And we are not gonna write off Rene.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.028
We're gonna find him.
We're gonna bring him back.

40:50.073 --> 40:51.325
Wherever he is.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.372
Ah.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.837
Wakey, wakey.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.432
Hey, hell. Man.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.560
Been a long time
since I've been tagged like this.

41:11.052 --> 41:12.975
- Respect.
- Oh, my pleasure.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.769
But I promise you, if you untie me,

41:15.932 --> 41:17.855
I'll show you a hell of a lot
more than respect.

41:18.059 --> 41:22.405
Ooh, man, you've got spirit
and I am duly impressed.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.900
But I'm gonna break that spirit.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.577
I'm gonna break your soul.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.916
And when we're finished,
assuming that you're still alive...

41:33.074 --> 41:36.374
Now, I wouldn't bet
no money on that, though,

41:36.536 --> 41:40.461
there's gonna be very little of you left
for the Green Arrow to work with.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.260
Light him up.
