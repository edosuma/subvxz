you wanted me to go with you

need a beer, Rick?

03:31.559 --> 03:34.475
That's very

- Okay.

is, uh, Suzy ever gonna make

03:43.005 --> 03:44.876
or are things
just kind of status quo?

03:44.920 --> 03:47.879
Mm, things are still
very much status quo.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.098
She told me last night

03:49.141 --> 03:50.404
the thought
of being physically intimate

03:50.447 --> 03:52.623
with somebody was enough
to make her want to vomit.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.059
And this is coming
from a woman

03:54.103 --> 03:55.409
who is binge-eating pickles

03:55.452 --> 03:57.280
wrapped
in processed cheese slices.

03:57.324 --> 04:00.022
Okay, so she's having cravings.
Just not the right ones.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.329
That's right. But, you
know, I-I'm okay with it.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.895
I mean, right now,

04:03.939 --> 04:06.158
my job is to support her
through this pregnancy.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.639
If she wants to go
further later on, great,

04:08.683 --> 04:11.425
but, uh, you know, I'm not
gonna force the issue.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.774
It's still got to be tough, though,

04:12.817 --> 04:14.254
spending so much time with her

04:14.297 --> 04:15.733
when you have
all these feelings, right?

04:15.777 --> 04:16.908
I get that you don't want
to jeopardize

04:16.952 --> 04:18.214
the partnership. I understand

04:18.258 --> 04:19.389
that part of it.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.304
Okay, hang on.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.132
Why, all of a sudden,
are you asking

04:23.175 --> 04:25.221
these deeply probing questions?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.788
I mean, no offense,
but you have

04:26.831 --> 04:28.790
the emotional intelligence
of a nine-year-old.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.835
- That is not true.
- Come on, man. We're brothers.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.184
You can tell me anything.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.016
All right. Um...

04:39.191 --> 04:41.063
So, lately, I've been
kind of coming to terms

04:41.106 --> 04:42.978
with the fact that...

04:43.021 --> 04:45.763
I may possibly,

04:45.807 --> 04:49.245
uh, have feelings for Higgins.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.205
Now, I know
this is a lot to take in.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.207
Uh-huh.

04:55.251 --> 04:58.385
- What are you doing?
- I'm just recording the date

04:58.428 --> 05:00.430
- and time.
- Of?

05:00.474 --> 05:02.171
Of the moment where you realized

05:02.214 --> 05:03.868
what the rest of
us already know:

05:03.912 --> 05:06.131
that you and Higgins are
meant for each other.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.742
I mean, TC, Kumu and I,

05:07.785 --> 05:09.570
we got a text chain
going about it.

05:09.613 --> 05:10.745
Okay, first of all,
a text chain?

05:10.788 --> 05:12.616
That's pretty juvenile. Secondly,

05:12.660 --> 05:14.009
it's not that simple.
I mean,

05:14.052 --> 05:15.750
Higgins and I
are business partners, right?

05:15.793 --> 05:18.013
If things go wrong,
which they may,

05:18.056 --> 05:19.797
it could be very awkward,

05:19.841 --> 05:21.451
especially considering
how close everybody is.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.148
It would just get weird.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.586
Oh, so you're gonna die alone
for the sake of me?

05:25.629 --> 05:28.240
- That's very thoughtful of you.
- No, that's not what I'm saying. What I <i>am</i> saying is

05:28.284 --> 05:30.068
that if I'm gonna explore this,

05:30.112 --> 05:32.114
then I just want to make sure
that it's...

05:32.157 --> 05:34.029
it's the right move, you know?

05:34.072 --> 05:35.900
Yeah, fair enough.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.163
But maybe instead

05:38.207 --> 05:39.774
of thinking of all the ways
it could go bad,

05:39.817 --> 05:41.645
you think of the ways
it could go good.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.473
You owe that to yourself.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.827
Come on, man. You got this.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.612
Ten.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.440
Uh-huh.

05:53.483 --> 05:54.919
Eleven!

05:56.660 --> 05:58.923
That's outstanding,
dude. That's a new high.

05:58.967 --> 06:01.012
There's no way I'm gonna
make my goal by summer.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.754
Hey, that's what I thought when
I first made it to boot camp.

06:03.798 --> 06:06.540
Trust me, you keep
doing this Marine PT,

06:06.583 --> 06:08.629
you'll be busting out
20 pull-ups in no time.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.589
All right? We rest
when we dead, baby.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.375
Plank position.
One minute. Let's go.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.419
You know,
some people might consider this

06:16.463 --> 06:17.725
a form of child abuse.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.944
Look, you want to be able

06:19.988 --> 06:22.294
to post up bigger
- defenders, right?
- Yeah.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.644
This is what it takes.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.863
Oh, thank you, God.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.953
All right, get a drink
while I take this.

06:30.564 --> 06:31.869
Hey, Gordie, what's up?

06:31.913 --> 06:33.784
Listen, I just spoke
with Cade's social worker.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.876
Is something wrong?
Well, she just found out his mom

06:38.920 --> 06:40.225
has family back on the mainland.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.792
They were recently notified
about her death.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.577
Seems they didn't know
where she'd been living

06:43.620 --> 06:44.839
or that she even had a son.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.275
Wow.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.842
Okay.
There's more.

06:47.885 --> 06:50.061
Cade's grandmother
just flew in from Tennessee.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.889
She's asking to meet with him.

06:54.326 --> 06:57.025
- You still there?
- Uh, yeah. Sorry.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.506
I'm just processing.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.116
So, this lady
wants to meet, huh?

07:01.159 --> 07:02.683
I'm guessing
it's to make her case

07:02.726 --> 07:05.599
as to why Cade
would be better off with her.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.601
How 'bout we just take things
one step at a time.

07:07.644 --> 07:10.517
For now, she just wants to set
a time and introduce herself.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.128
Yeah, okay.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.043
But before
we make that happen,

07:15.086 --> 07:16.914
I want to meet
with her first.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.612
- Just the two of us.
- Fair enough.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.440
I'll set it up,
send you the details.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.006
All right, Gordie.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.706
Is everything cool?

07:25.749 --> 07:28.578
Yeah. It's all good.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.275
Least, it will be

07:30.319 --> 07:32.669
till you get halfway
through this two-minute plank.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.802
Two minutes?
It was supposed to be one.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.804
That was
before I gave you a break.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.632
Let's go, baby.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.547
- Oorah!
- Oorah!

07:56.911 --> 07:58.347
Oh. Magnum.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.829
How long
have you been standing there?

08:01.872 --> 08:05.485
Uh, sorry. I just didn't want
to startle you.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.488
Little early in the day,
don't you think?

08:09.532 --> 08:11.273
Something you need?

08:11.316 --> 08:14.189
Need? No, there's nothing
I need. I was just thinking

08:14.232 --> 08:17.105
that since we don't have
anything on the schedule,

08:17.148 --> 08:20.761
maybe we could do something
outside of work, like...

08:22.153 --> 08:24.242
...hike Pillbox or something.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.681
What is it?

08:27.724 --> 08:29.160
Oh.

08:29.204 --> 08:32.990
No, that sounds... lovely.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.993
Unfortunately,

08:36.037 --> 08:37.952
I already have plans.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.823
Cole invited me

08:39.867 --> 08:41.738
on a picnic. Hence the...

08:42.739 --> 08:44.262
Cole.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.221
So you're not just texting?

08:46.264 --> 08:48.528
No. It's still very early.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.660
I mean, we'll see.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.054
Okay. Well...

08:53.097 --> 08:54.621
have fun.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.276
It's the front gate.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.756
Hello.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.541
Is this Magnum
and Higgins Investigations?

09:01.584 --> 09:03.586
It is, yes.
I'm sorry. I know

09:03.630 --> 09:06.371
I don't have an appointment,
but I really need your help.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.508
Okay. So, just
so we're clear,

09:12.552 --> 09:14.815
the last thing you remember
is leaving a bar in Wisconsin

09:14.858 --> 09:17.469
with a woman who had
bought you several drinks.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.776
And then, nearly two
days later, you end up

09:19.820 --> 09:21.996
on a beach on Oahu

09:22.039 --> 09:23.519
with blood on your clothes

09:23.563 --> 09:25.695
and no recollection
of how you got there?

09:25.739 --> 09:27.871
Yeah, that's right.

09:27.915 --> 09:31.092
Also, I'm pretty sure
this blood isn't mine.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.920
I-I don't seem
to be cut anywhere.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.399
Well, clearly,
you're the victim here.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.532
This woman
obviously drugged you, right?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.882
So I think the next course
of action is to go to HPD

09:38.926 --> 09:40.710
so they can launch
a formal investigation.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.451
N-No, I-I can't go to the cops.

09:43.539 --> 09:46.890
Mr. Nettles, is there something
else you're not telling us?

09:49.893 --> 09:52.026
After I woke up, I...

09:52.069 --> 09:54.071
I found this in my pocket.

10:02.123 --> 10:04.168
It's recently been fired.

10:04.212 --> 10:08.303
Right. Well, I guess
I'd better cancel that picnic.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.008
Okay, here we
are. Looks like

10:18.052 --> 10:19.923
the gun was reported stolen

10:19.967 --> 10:21.403
two years ago, and
it's been linked

10:21.446 --> 10:23.927
to some unsolved robberies
in Michigan and Virginia.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.755
And eventually ended up
in the hands of our client,

10:25.799 --> 10:29.150
who has no idea how he got it
or how he got to Hawaii.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.717
This case is gonna be a breeze.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.635
Ah, look at that.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.506
- The aloha look suits you.
- Um,

10:37.549 --> 10:39.421
thanks for lending me
some clothes.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.857
Yeah, of course.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.120
Uh, everything okay?

10:43.164 --> 10:47.298
I didn't notice until I started
to change, but...

10:47.342 --> 10:49.823
That looks like a seat belt
bruise from a car accident.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.781
How does this even happen?

10:51.825 --> 10:54.305
HIGGINS:Well, I've done a
little research,

10:54.349 --> 10:56.090
and based on the symptoms
that you told me about--

10:56.133 --> 10:58.266
the dizziness, the dry mouth
and the light sensitivity--

10:58.309 --> 11:01.486
I think that you've been drugged
with scopolamine.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.184
What's that?

11:04.446 --> 11:06.796
- I just assumed I was roofied.
- HIGGINS:Rohypnol

11:06.840 --> 11:09.494
knocks you out, so it's unlikely
you would have been lucid enough

11:09.538 --> 11:11.801
to board a plane without
TCA stopping you,

11:11.845 --> 11:13.760
whereas scopolamine
will leave you fully conscious

11:13.803 --> 11:15.152
but very suggestible.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.024
It also erases memory

11:17.067 --> 11:18.373
of events.
Criminal organizations

11:18.416 --> 11:20.201
have used it to rob tourists.

11:20.244 --> 11:22.551
Well, if it's money
that lady was after,

11:22.594 --> 11:23.857
she picked a bad target.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.816
I got maybe 800 bucks
to my name.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.470
At least, I did yesterday.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.777
Guessing I'm broke now.
Well, actually,

11:30.820 --> 11:32.300
I ran your financials,

11:32.343 --> 11:33.780
and they haven't touched
your checking account.

11:33.823 --> 11:34.694
There are just a couple
of recent charges

11:34.737 --> 11:36.260
on your credit card.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.349
There's one for a flight
from Milwaukee to Honolulu

11:38.393 --> 11:40.482
and another
for a local car rental company

11:40.525 --> 11:41.831
here on Oahu.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.138
So, wait,
this wasn't about robbing me?

11:44.181 --> 11:45.617
No.

11:45.661 --> 11:46.967
It was about getting you here
to Hawaii.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.316
Yeah, and I think she just used

11:48.359 --> 11:49.578
your credit card
to avoid being traced

11:49.621 --> 11:51.058
from the purchases.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.755
Why would someone
want to bring me to Hawaii?

11:52.799 --> 11:54.757
I've never been before.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.019
I don't know anyone here.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.455
Look, I know this is, uh...

11:57.499 --> 11:59.022
It's all very overwhelming,

11:59.066 --> 12:01.677
but we're doing our best
to get you some answers.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.853
HIGGINS:For starters, I'm gonna
look into the car rental,

12:03.897 --> 12:06.116
and I'm also gonna contact
the bar in Wisconsin

12:06.160 --> 12:08.466
to see if they can help me ID
the lady who drugged you.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.859
And while she's doing that,

12:09.903 --> 12:11.382
I think we should
probably get you to a doctor.

12:11.426 --> 12:14.255
No. Won't the hospital
just report me to the cops?

12:14.298 --> 12:16.866
I wouldn't worry about that.
The doctor we're taking you to,

12:16.910 --> 12:19.477
uh, doesn't work at a hospital.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.885
- I'm here for a Mrs. Jensen?
- Mm-hmm. Right this way.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.413
Hi, Mrs. Jensen.

12:42.457 --> 12:43.806
I'm Theodore Calvin.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.373
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me.

12:49.116 --> 12:52.772
I am so grateful for everything
you've done for my grandson.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.078
Of course. He's a...

12:55.122 --> 12:56.688
He's a great kid.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.823
Um, please have a seat.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.961
I'll be honest.
The last few weeks

13:08.004 --> 13:09.876
have been a real
roller coaster.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.052
It had been nearly 20 years

13:12.095 --> 13:15.577
since I've seen
or heard about Monica.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.581
Learning she died
the way she did...

13:21.104 --> 13:24.673
Well, that sort of thing
can really break you.

13:25.717 --> 13:28.285
But then to be told
she had a son,

13:28.329 --> 13:29.809
that I had a grandson?

13:29.852 --> 13:31.854
It gave me hope
that something good

13:31.898 --> 13:33.638
might come out of this tragedy.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.860
That's actually
why I wanted to meet with you,

13:37.904 --> 13:42.038
to get a sense
of what your expectations are.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.214
I understand
Cade had it pretty hard

13:44.258 --> 13:46.390
after Monica passed.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.741
And you are a saint
for taking him in.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.656
But I'm here now,

13:51.700 --> 13:54.746
and I can give Cade
something he hasn't had

13:54.790 --> 13:56.487
since his mother died.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.794
Well, I agree with you,
Ms. Jensen,

13:58.838 --> 14:02.493
that... that kid's
been through more hurt than...

14:02.537 --> 14:04.626
anyone
should ever have to suffer.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.936
But he's got people here now.

14:09.979 --> 14:14.070
I mean, we may not be his blood,
but we are family.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.029
We've given him a home.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.901
A job. Stability.

14:18.945 --> 14:22.035
And you just show up
out the blue.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.560
I'm just worried
that Cade's life

14:25.603 --> 14:27.475
may be disrupted again.

14:28.519 --> 14:31.653
You're right. And it's a lot
to put on you all.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.046
And believe me,

14:33.089 --> 14:35.657
I only want
what's best for Cade.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.399
But I think you'll agree

14:38.442 --> 14:42.664
he deserves a chance
to meet his grandmother.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.535
So, please,

14:44.579 --> 14:46.973
can I see him?

14:52.587 --> 14:55.416
Not a fan of needles,
I'm guessing.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.635
I don't mind 'em usually,
but, uh...

14:57.679 --> 15:00.508
I'm feeling a little queasy
today for some reason.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.553
Stomach pain's a symptom
of scopolamine.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.382
But we'll know for sure
when the tox panel comes back.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.259
Oh.

15:12.302 --> 15:15.523
Winner, winner,
chicken katsu dinner.

15:15.566 --> 15:18.091
Looks like we got a hit
on the blood from your shirt.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.528
CODIS matched it to
a Trevor Lyttle?

15:20.571 --> 15:22.312
Aggravated assault,

15:22.356 --> 15:23.835
armed robbery.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.970
Most of these charges are
from Michigan and Virginia.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.277
Same states where
the gun was used.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.323
So, not only did you end up

15:33.367 --> 15:34.977
with Trevor Lyttle's
blood on you.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.545
You also ended
up with his gun.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.462
What's up?

15:41.505 --> 15:43.116
I've seen him before.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.118
<i>He was on top of me,</i>

15:45.161 --> 15:47.207
<i>and-and he had his hands</i> <i>
around my neck.</i>

15:47.250 --> 15:48.948
<i>He was trying to kill me.</i>

15:48.991 --> 15:50.950
But I got his gun away from him.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.084
<i>It just fired in my hand.</i>

15:55.128 --> 15:56.433
<i>I don't think I killed him,</i> <i>
but...</i>

15:56.477 --> 15:58.392
but I might have shot
his ear off.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.135
Okay.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.225
Yeah, that's, um...

16:05.268 --> 16:07.009
...a lot.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.359
Yeah, yeah. Give us
a second, will you?

16:15.322 --> 16:17.585
Higgy, good timing.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.717
So, we just ID'd
one of the kidnappers,

16:19.761 --> 16:22.372
and Greg is starting
to get his memory back.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.722
Brilliant.
We're going to need it.

16:24.766 --> 16:27.029
I found the car
they rented under his name.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.162
You should come see this.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.793
I guess it's a little late

16:51.836 --> 16:54.230
to ask if I took out
rental insurance.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.711
You know, if Lyttle
was behind the wheel,

16:56.754 --> 16:58.321
airbag could've broken his nose,

16:58.365 --> 17:00.106
which would cause
- all that blood. Yeah.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.847
The tire marks on the road
indicate that the car swerved

17:02.891 --> 17:04.327
before coming off it.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.983
<i>She was in the car, too.</i><i>Angie?</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:10.420
<i>Yeah, she was hitting me, trying
to get something away from me.</i>

17:10.464 --> 17:12.988
<i>And then Trevor</i> <i>
reached back to help.</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:14.990
<i>That's when we crashed.</i>

17:22.084 --> 17:24.043
Okay. Can you remember anything
after that?

17:28.003 --> 17:30.266
<i>I made it out of the car,</i> <i>
but before I knew it...</i>

17:32.225 --> 17:34.053
<i>...Lyttle was on top of me.</i>

17:34.096 --> 17:35.967
Well, that explains
how you got his blood on you.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.491
Honestly, the more

17:37.534 --> 17:38.796
I remember, the less any of this

17:38.840 --> 17:40.624
makes sense.
What was I even doing

17:40.668 --> 17:42.409
in a car with them?
Where were we going?

17:42.452 --> 17:43.845
Can't tell you
where you were going,

17:43.888 --> 17:45.151
but I can tell you
where you came from.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.676
Parking receipt
from Hawaii Union Bank.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.982
Time stamp, 4:37 p.m.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.462
yesterday afternoon.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.247
Well, that's only
a couple of miles from here,

17:54.290 --> 17:56.205
so it stands to reason that's
where you were coming from

17:56.249 --> 17:59.513
- when you crashed.
- Why the hell would they take me to a bank?

18:02.298 --> 18:05.127
Geez, it's like I'm watching
someone else.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.652
I seem so... normal.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.655
They're taking you to the back,

18:11.699 --> 18:13.788
which is normally where
the safe-deposit boxes are.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.137
Yeah, but don't you need a key
for those?

18:15.181 --> 18:16.573
I mean,
why would they let me back there

18:16.617 --> 18:18.445
- if I don't have an account?
- Not sure.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.708
But there aren't any cameras
back there for privacy reasons.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.754
So there's no way to know
what I did back there.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.584
It doesn't even look like
I left with anything.

18:27.628 --> 18:30.109
Or whatever was
in the safe-deposit box

18:30.152 --> 18:31.675
is small enough
to fit in your pocket.

18:33.068 --> 18:36.724
Wait, that's her. That's Angie.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.554
Okay, so she went
through all this trouble, right?

18:40.597 --> 18:42.121
She drugged you,
brought you to Hawaii

18:42.164 --> 18:44.949
to get whatever was
in that safe-deposit box.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.342
Which begs the question,

18:46.386 --> 18:49.302
what was inside it
that was worth so much effort?

19:01.052 --> 19:03.533
Does the name Frank Medina
ring a bell?

19:03.577 --> 19:05.796
Never heard of him. Why?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.972
Because the safe-deposit
box that you accessed

19:08.016 --> 19:10.366
belongs to him,
and he listed you

19:10.410 --> 19:11.846
as the beneficiary.

19:11.889 --> 19:15.545
Why would a stranger
make me his beneficiary?

19:15.589 --> 19:17.634
I don't know.
But according to Mr. Medina's

19:17.678 --> 19:20.333
recent account activity,
he's still very much alive

19:20.376 --> 19:22.030
and living here on the island.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.778
Great. Now what?

19:30.821 --> 19:32.083
Well,
this is typically the point

19:32.127 --> 19:33.607
where Magnum picks the lock.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.217
Ah.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.176
Don't have to.
It's already open.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.352
Isn't this
breaking and entering?

19:39.395 --> 19:41.745
Technically, it's trespassing.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.232
Oh.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.451
It looks like we aren't
the only people

19:51.494 --> 19:52.756
looking for Frank Medina.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.367
Shouldn't we leave?

19:54.410 --> 19:56.499
This is a crime scene now,
isn't it?

20:00.286 --> 20:01.591
What is it?

20:01.635 --> 20:03.114
This is me when
I was a kid.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.465
Who's the old guy?
That's

20:05.508 --> 20:07.945
my grandpa Ralph Nettles.

20:07.989 --> 20:11.166
But I haven't seen or heard
from him in over 20 years.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.615
Higgins?

20:25.659 --> 20:27.704
You should come here.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.409
No.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.588
Look, I'm...

20:41.631 --> 20:43.416
I'm really sorry, Greg.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.418
Thanks. It's, uh...

20:45.461 --> 20:48.159
It's just a lot to take in.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.205
Yeah.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.294
I'm guessing
you had absolutely no idea

20:52.338 --> 20:55.863
your grandfather was living
in Hawaii under an alias.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.995
I didn't even know
he was still alive.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.780
He and my dad

20:59.823 --> 21:01.869
had a falling-out
when I was a kid.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.697
Well...

21:04.698 --> 21:06.395
I'm no M.E.,

21:06.439 --> 21:08.702
but I think he's been dead
for at least a couple days.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.878
Found this shell
casing by his gun,

21:10.921 --> 21:12.793
so I think he got
a couple shots off

21:12.836 --> 21:15.186
when Angie and Lyttle
entered the room.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.580
How can you be so sure
it was them?

21:17.624 --> 21:19.800
Well, they tore the place apart
until they found the contract

21:19.843 --> 21:21.584
for your grandfather's
safe-deposit box.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.282
It was left out on a table.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.501
And that's how they knew
that Greg was the beneficiary.

21:25.545 --> 21:28.156
MAGNUM:Yeah, we should dig into
your grandfather's past.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.810
See what he's been up to
for the past couple decades.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.812
It could give us some
insight as to what could be

21:31.855 --> 21:34.902
in that safe-deposit box that
would be worth so much trouble.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.296
Yeah. And, Greg, I'm sorry,

21:37.339 --> 21:39.167
but we really are
gonna have to alert HPD.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.169
This is a murder case now.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.692
No, yeah. I-I get it.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.215
You all right?

21:44.259 --> 21:46.305
Oh, the stomach pain.
It's, uh...

21:46.348 --> 21:49.090
- It's getting worse.
- You could have internal bleeding

21:49.133 --> 21:51.397
from the car accident. We have
to get him to a hospital.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.486
Yeah, but we can't
leave the crime scene.

21:53.529 --> 21:54.617
Got an idea.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.967
Hey, Kumu.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.404
We need a favor.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.190
<i>Hey, man. Can I talk to you</i>

22:02.233 --> 22:03.713
<i>for a second?</i><i>
Yeah, what's up?</i>

22:03.757 --> 22:06.455
I got some news from
your social worker this morning.

22:07.891 --> 22:11.112
Your, uh, grandmom
just arrived on the island.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.809
Your mom's mom?

22:12.853 --> 22:14.376
And she wants to meet you.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.943
What?

22:15.986 --> 22:17.553
I-I don't understand.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.033
Your family on the mainland

22:19.076 --> 22:20.861
didn't know anything about you.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.384
They only just found out

22:22.428 --> 22:24.517
when they were contacted
about your mom's passing.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.694
Your grandmom booked a flight,
and now she's here.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.087
Look, this is

22:30.131 --> 22:32.394
totally your call,
but for what it's worth,

22:32.438 --> 22:34.875
I met with her this morning,
and she seems nice.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.964
She just wants a chance
to meet you.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.664
What do you think I should do?

22:41.708 --> 22:43.318
Well, she did come all this way.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.146
Maybe you should hear her out.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.453
See what she has to say.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.237
Will you be there with me?

22:49.280 --> 22:51.500
Yeah, if that's what you want.

22:52.545 --> 22:53.720
Yeah.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.112
Then you got it.

23:01.815 --> 23:04.426
Hey. Uh...

23:04.470 --> 23:07.342
Got to say, I'm impressed
with how well you handled that.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.431
Things are going so well
for Cade.

23:09.475 --> 23:10.954
Suddenly some relatives show up,

23:10.998 --> 23:12.739
want to take space
in the kid's life?

23:12.782 --> 23:14.001
I'd be freaking out.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.437
I <i>am</i> freaking out.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.004
I just don't want Cade
to see it.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.527
Every time that kid

23:18.571 --> 23:20.050
gets his footing
around here,

23:20.094 --> 23:21.574
the rug gets snatched
out from under him.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.532
I hear you, pal. It ain't easy.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.360
But you're doing
the right thing.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.841
Man, I don't even know if I know
what the right thing is anymore.

23:39.374 --> 23:42.116
Okay, they have your insurance.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.683
Now comes the fun part.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.511
Growing old while we wait.

23:49.732 --> 23:52.213
Juliet told me
about your grandfather.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.389
I'm so very sorry.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.173
Well, thanks.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.611
You know, it was only after

23:58.654 --> 24:01.222
he left that, uh,

24:01.265 --> 24:02.658
I started to appreciate

24:02.702 --> 24:05.356
all the adventures
he dragged me on.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.098
You know, riding around
on his motorcycle

24:08.142 --> 24:10.274
and playing hooky from school
to go hunting.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.410
Ah, he'd probably be disappointed

24:15.454 --> 24:17.760
to see I'm still in Wisconsin.

24:17.804 --> 24:20.110
Working 50-hour weeks.

24:20.154 --> 24:22.722
Living my boring life.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.290
There's nothing wrong
with a quiet,

24:26.334 --> 24:28.336
stable life.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.425
That's what most people want.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.472
True. But, uh...

24:34.908 --> 24:37.650
I guess when Grandpa split,

24:37.693 --> 24:39.347
I, uh...

24:41.305 --> 24:44.221
I kind of stopped believing
anything was possible.

24:45.222 --> 24:46.920
Sounds like a special guy.

24:46.963 --> 24:49.575
He was larger than life.

24:51.577 --> 24:54.667
Oh, I wish I'd have gotten
some more of his genes.

24:54.710 --> 24:58.279
I bet there's more of him in you
than you think.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.600
Okay, well, seems
like we got a hit

25:14.643 --> 25:16.906
on one of the prints CSU pulled,

25:16.950 --> 25:18.604
but it wasn't to Lyttle

25:18.647 --> 25:19.953
or the female accomplice.

25:19.996 --> 25:20.997
Who, then?

25:21.041 --> 25:22.346
No ID.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.784
But it matches
prints from a heist

25:24.827 --> 25:27.961
in Antwerp's diamond district
back in August 2003.

25:28.004 --> 25:31.617
A 40-karat diamond valued
at over $3 million was stolen.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.923
Well, Greg's grandfather
opened the safety-deposit box

25:33.967 --> 25:35.882
in September 2003.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.013
That's right around
the same time

25:37.057 --> 25:38.885
he disappeared from Greg's life.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.756
You throw in the fact
that he was living

25:40.800 --> 25:42.497
under an assumed name,
I'm beginning to think

25:42.541 --> 25:44.673
Ralph Nettles
was behind that heist.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.545
So, somehow Lyttle and
Angie discovered Nettles

25:46.588 --> 25:48.503
was hiding the diamond
in the safe-deposit box.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.983
They track him down.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.724
But before they can get him
to give up the key,

25:51.767 --> 25:53.900
he pulls a gun,
forcing them to shoot him.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.466
So they toss the place,

25:55.510 --> 25:57.730
find the safe-deposit contract,

25:57.773 --> 25:59.296
and then they realize

25:59.340 --> 26:02.125
that the only hope they have
is your client.

26:03.300 --> 26:07.174
Well, at least now we can
give Greg some answers.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.538
Ms. Jensen, this is...

26:23.582 --> 26:24.713
Cade.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.717
You are the spitting image
of your mother.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.807
It's nice to meet you.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.723
Let's sit down.

26:34.767 --> 26:38.292
I had so many things
I wanted to say,

26:38.335 --> 26:40.511
and now,
sitting here looking at you,

26:40.555 --> 26:42.426
I am speechless.

26:47.170 --> 26:50.260
Well, Cade's been doing
really well in school.

26:50.304 --> 26:53.133
His teachers say he's almost
all the way caught up,

26:53.176 --> 26:54.874
and he even made
the basketball team.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.702
That's wonderful.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.748
My children, they were always
excellent athletes.

26:59.792 --> 27:03.273
My youngest son
even played baseball in college.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.232
I-I have an uncle?
Two.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.887
And an aunt.
Too many cousins to count.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.149
Some of them

27:09.192 --> 27:11.281
are around the same age
as you.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.414
You could be
going to school together.

27:18.245 --> 27:21.291
I just know
they would love to meet you.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.772
Maybe you can visit.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.690
I've got a question.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.083
Of course.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.392
Where have you been
all this time?

27:38.831 --> 27:41.660
Your mother Monica,

27:41.703 --> 27:44.575
sh-sh-she was always...

27:44.619 --> 27:46.229
strong-willed.

27:46.273 --> 27:49.580
We tried to help her,
but at a certain point

27:49.624 --> 27:52.018
she stopped wanting
to be helped.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.933
Maybe, but she never stopped
needing it.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.849
Cade.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.546
We didn't know where she was.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.853
We didn't know about you.

28:00.896 --> 28:04.160
But now we do,
and I am here to tell you

28:04.204 --> 28:06.075
that you're part of our family.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.947
You don't have to be alone.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.688
Well, that's just it.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.341
I'm not alone.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.908
Cade, please. No,

28:12.952 --> 28:14.083
you don't get it.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.913
Your other grandkids,
they might need you.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.437
My mom,
she might have needed you.

28:20.481 --> 28:21.917
But I don't.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.400
Just go home.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.753
He's right.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.060
I should have done more
for Monica.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.975
I should have kept looking.

28:36.018 --> 28:38.673
Now she's gone.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.458
Cade's all I have left of her.

28:41.502 --> 28:45.332
And I don't even have him, do I?

28:46.768 --> 28:49.292
Maybe this was just...

28:49.336 --> 28:52.600
too much too soon.

28:52.643 --> 28:55.472
He's in good hands here.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.561
I can see that now.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.783
Thank you so much, Mr. Calvin.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.232
It's a lot to digest,

29:16.276 --> 29:18.713
but at least Greg finally knows
what happened to him.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.324
Agreed. This experience
couldn't have been easy,

29:21.368 --> 29:24.110
but hopefully closure
will be worth it.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.242
Yeah.

29:26.286 --> 29:27.330
Kumu?

29:27.374 --> 29:29.463
Uh, no. It's, uh, Cole.

29:29.506 --> 29:32.422
I'll get back to him later.

29:37.427 --> 29:38.864
So, you know...

29:39.865 --> 29:41.431
You know, this morning...

29:41.475 --> 29:44.826
I was just wondering

29:44.870 --> 29:48.743
what compelled you to ask me
to spend the day with you.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.093
Just kind of seemed
like it came out of nowhere.

29:51.137 --> 29:54.662
Uh, I don't know.

29:54.705 --> 29:57.491
Uh, TC was training Cade,

29:57.534 --> 29:59.710
and-and Rick's
on daddy duty,

29:59.754 --> 30:03.279
so... Right. So you're saying you just
didn't have any better options?

30:03.323 --> 30:05.064
No, that's not what I'm saying.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.761
That's not
what I'm saying at all. I...Thomas,

30:06.805 --> 30:08.632
it's okay. I'm kidding.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.507
♪ Why can't we be friends?

30:13.550 --> 30:15.030
Gordie, what's up?

30:15.074 --> 30:16.379
Got a hit on
our girl, Angie.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.120
The bar finally sent
over that footage.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.600
Facial recognition ID'd her

30:19.643 --> 30:21.254
as Chloe De Witte. 29.

30:21.297 --> 30:22.951
Belgian national.
The fact that she's

30:22.995 --> 30:24.692
from the same country where
the diamond heist took place

30:24.735 --> 30:26.520
can't be a coincidence.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.522
Although there's no way she
was involved. She's too young.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.611
She is.
But her father wasn't.

30:30.654 --> 30:33.092
According to Interpol,
the Antwerp heist

30:33.135 --> 30:35.529
was a two-man job
which included Chloe's father,

30:35.572 --> 30:36.965
Bertrand De Witte.

30:37.009 --> 30:39.141
He was arrested and died
in prison two years ago.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.882
So that's how she knew
about Ralph Nettles.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.537
She then enlists
Trevor Lyttle

30:43.580 --> 30:46.018
to track him down
- and get the diamond. Exactly.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.585
But it doesn't appear Chloe
and Trevor actually got it.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.110
Why do you say that?
Because they're still on the island.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.981
Chloe's credit card
was used last night

30:53.025 --> 30:55.114
to book a room
at the Aloha Sands Motel.

30:55.157 --> 30:56.724
It was used again today

30:56.767 --> 30:59.814
for parking at
the Honolulu Memorial Hospital.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.773
So, what, they're treating
injuries from the car accident?

31:02.817 --> 31:04.427
That's what we thought, too,

31:04.471 --> 31:07.300
until we saw they visited
three more hospitals today.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.563
They're looking for Greg.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.347
Right. They're not treating
their injuries.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.175
They're hoping
that he's treating his.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.655
Greg remembered

31:14.698 --> 31:16.178
struggling with Chloe
over something in the car.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.527
It must have been
the diamond.

31:17.571 --> 31:18.833
They think he knows
where it's at.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.226
And if they find him,

31:20.269 --> 31:21.705
the fact that he doesn't
remember anything

31:21.749 --> 31:23.577
is not gonna save his life.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.323
Hello?

31:30.366 --> 31:31.890
Kumu, we think Greg
may be in danger.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.240
The two of you need to leave
the hospital right now.

31:34.283 --> 31:35.676
But he's not with me.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.417
They just took him back
for an X-ray.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.332
Find security. Tell 'em they
got to lock down the building.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.594
Okay.

31:54.695 --> 31:55.914
Sir, stay in your room.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.765
Sorry, ma'am.
Building's been locked down.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.419
You'll have to take...

32:32.167 --> 32:33.734
Hi. Kumu.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.301
I'm so sorry.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.129
It's not your fault, Kumu.
I'm gonna call Gordon.

32:37.172 --> 32:40.045
HPD should be able
- to track the car.
I don't understand.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.872
Why do they think
Greg has any idea

32:41.916 --> 32:43.178
what happened to the diamond?

32:43.222 --> 32:44.832
No idea.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.573
Ms. Tuileta?

32:46.616 --> 32:48.183
I understand Mr.
Nettles consented

32:48.227 --> 32:50.229
to informing you
about his condition.

32:50.272 --> 32:51.970
There's something
you need to see.

33:00.239 --> 33:02.502
You got to be kidding me.

33:09.509 --> 33:10.989
He's waking up!

33:11.032 --> 33:12.251
Oh, well. I suppose this will be

33:12.294 --> 33:13.904
a lot more painful for him now.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.036
Get him on the floor.

33:27.614 --> 33:28.963
No!

33:30.921 --> 33:33.141
Time to get back
what you took.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.361
No! Oh, God, no!

33:41.845 --> 33:44.109
He's moving too much!

33:44.152 --> 33:45.501
Not for long.

33:46.241 --> 33:48.983
Wait! You want the entire motel
to hear the gunshot?

33:49.027 --> 33:51.116
Get something to muffle it.

33:53.205 --> 33:55.207
This will only take a minute. No, please!

33:55.250 --> 33:56.599
Good to see you again,
by the way.

34:07.567 --> 34:10.004
HPD! Hands in the air!

34:27.761 --> 34:29.850
I can't thank you enough.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.895
Just glad we got here in time.

34:33.201 --> 34:35.334
We'll circle back for more info,

34:35.377 --> 34:37.292
soon as we're done
questioning her.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.729
In the meantime, these guys are
gonna take you to the hospital,

34:39.773 --> 34:41.992
get that diamond
out of your tummy.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.429
It's actually probably
for the best.

34:43.472 --> 34:45.083
I mean, if we let Mother Nature
run its course,

34:45.126 --> 34:49.130
it would be... unpleasant.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.914
Still can't believe I did that.

34:50.958 --> 34:53.526
Guess the drugs were
wearing off and I had, like,

34:53.569 --> 34:55.441
a moment of clarity
or something.

34:55.484 --> 34:58.139
Seems like your abductors
not only overestimated

34:58.183 --> 35:00.185
the potency of those drugs,

35:00.228 --> 35:02.709
they also
underestimated you, Greg.

35:05.015 --> 35:07.453
We got a warrant for
the remaining contents

35:07.496 --> 35:08.932
of the safe deposit box.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.066
Looks like your grandfather
left this for you.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.071
We'll give you a little bit
of privacy.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.032
Thanks for your help today.

35:22.076 --> 35:23.904
Thank you for yours.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.601
Can you drop by HPD later?

35:25.645 --> 35:27.429
Got a couple things I need
to go over for the report.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.039
Of course.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.432
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

35:30.476 --> 35:32.217
- I'll see you there.
- See you.

35:35.524 --> 35:39.615
Greg seems to be handling all
this pretty well, considering.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.662
Yeah, aside from losing
his grandfather,

35:42.705 --> 35:44.403
I think, uh, you know,
this whole thing's

35:44.446 --> 35:46.100
kind of been a
thrill for him.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.234
It shook him up, definitely,
but sort of in a good way.

35:49.277 --> 35:51.584
Yeah.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.414
What is it?

35:55.457 --> 35:58.025
- Got somewhere to be?
- Yeah. Kind of.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.636
It's Cole?

36:01.855 --> 36:04.205
No. No, I, uh,
I just have an appointment.

36:04.249 --> 36:07.034
I ordered an Uber,
I'm gonna go, but...

36:07.077 --> 36:08.340
Oh.

36:08.383 --> 36:09.558
I'll see you back at the house?

36:09.602 --> 36:11.734
- Yeah, sure.
- Bye.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.496
You're gonna make me
talk first, aren't you?

36:36.019 --> 36:38.239
That wasn't the
plan, but...

36:38.283 --> 36:40.154
if you got something
you want to say.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.723
She had no right to do that.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.768
I mean, who does she
think she is,

36:45.812 --> 36:47.988
showing up out of nowhere,
talking about my mom

36:48.031 --> 36:50.425
and, like, how I'm part
of her family now.

36:50.469 --> 36:52.427
You're right.

36:52.471 --> 36:54.255
It was a lot to put on you.

36:54.299 --> 36:58.520
Nobody can blame you
for how you reacted.

37:03.395 --> 37:06.833
So why do I feel so bad?

37:06.876 --> 37:11.054
Just one man's opinion here,
but maybe you feel bad

37:11.098 --> 37:13.448
because you see what I see.

37:13.492 --> 37:17.496
That your grandmom just wants
to be a part of your life.

37:17.539 --> 37:22.501
Maybe you're afraid that
you'll have to choose between

37:22.544 --> 37:27.070
the family you got here with me,
and the one you were born into.

37:27.114 --> 37:31.161
Well, I choose here.
I choose you.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.253
I know.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.994
But maybe...

37:39.257 --> 37:40.867
...maybe you don't
have to choose.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.131
What's this?

37:44.174 --> 37:45.350
Email confirmation
for the ticket

37:45.393 --> 37:46.742
to Nashville I bought you.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.178
Round trip.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.529
Leaves Wednesday morning,
but you can

37:50.572 --> 37:53.967
change the dates
or cancel altogether.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.360
It's your call.

37:55.403 --> 37:56.883
So you think I should
go see them?

37:58.276 --> 38:01.453
I think, if you do,

38:01.496 --> 38:04.194
the worst that can happen is
you come home

38:04.238 --> 38:06.022
wanting nothing to do with them.

38:08.503 --> 38:10.375
But if you don't go...

38:13.465 --> 38:18.078
Knowing where you come from,
good or bad,

38:18.121 --> 38:21.124
becomes more important
the older you get.

38:21.168 --> 38:24.171
It may not seem
like it now, but

38:24.214 --> 38:25.825
there'll be a day when

38:25.868 --> 38:28.088
you'll regret not knowing
that part of yourself.

38:32.962 --> 38:34.573
Whatever you decide,

38:34.616 --> 38:37.227
just know this...

38:37.271 --> 38:42.232
I'll always be here for you,
no matter what.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.590
Suzy?

38:51.633 --> 38:52.808
SUZY:In here!

38:52.852 --> 38:54.462
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.072
What are you doing?

38:56.116 --> 38:57.378
You know you're not supposed
to be on your feet

38:57.422 --> 38:58.597
for long stretches.

38:59.598 --> 39:01.382
- Trade you?
- Okay.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.166
Thank you.

39:08.607 --> 39:11.131
Mmm.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.046
Don't get me wrong.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.613
I want this baby out of me.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.441
But part of me's gonna
miss that smell.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.012
Mmm.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.669
You know...

39:29.018 --> 39:31.543
I think we're gonna be
really good at this.

39:37.766 --> 39:40.726
<i>Thanks so much for seeing me</i> <i>
at such short notice.</i>

39:40.769 --> 39:43.424
I always make time
for a patient in crisis.

39:43.468 --> 39:46.471
Well, I don't know that
"crisis" is, uh,

39:46.514 --> 39:49.038
quite the right word, but...

39:49.082 --> 39:51.606
And yet here we are,
well after office hours,

39:51.650 --> 39:53.216
with you struggling
to tell me something

39:53.260 --> 39:55.175
you clearly
need to say. Mm.

39:56.481 --> 40:01.268
So, I recently met
a wonderful man called Cole.

40:01.311 --> 40:04.140
And we've been texting
for the past few weeks

40:04.184 --> 40:07.187
and then he finally
asked me out on a date.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.885
Okay, that all sounds lovely.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.932
Yes, but unfortunately
I had to cancel

40:12.975 --> 40:14.847
because w-we were hired
for a job.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.501
You can always reschedule,
right?

40:16.544 --> 40:21.462
Yes, I could. Only...

40:22.724 --> 40:24.552
You don't want to.

40:24.596 --> 40:27.816
I think that's why I'm here.

40:28.991 --> 40:31.167
Before we landed the job,

40:31.211 --> 40:33.561
Magnum actually asked

40:33.605 --> 40:35.955
if I wanted to spend
the day with him.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.827
And the truth is that

40:38.871 --> 40:41.874
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about it.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.006
Like, what did he mean

40:44.050 --> 40:47.009
and...

40:47.053 --> 40:49.795
why such a small gesture
is affecting me so much.

40:49.838 --> 40:53.276
Maybe because you wanted
to spend the day with him?

40:53.320 --> 40:56.410
Well, I mean, at that moment,

40:56.454 --> 40:58.543
the idea of spending the day
with Magnum,

40:58.586 --> 41:02.111
it was more appealing than
the idea of a picnic with Cole.

41:02.155 --> 41:04.549
So-so-so, yes, I suppose so.

41:04.592 --> 41:05.811
I mean,

41:05.854 --> 41:07.726
in any case,

41:07.769 --> 41:09.075
I have to fix this because

41:09.118 --> 41:11.599
I can't have Magnum,
of all people,

41:11.643 --> 41:13.906
on my mind all the time.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.213
Well, you're having
a recurring dream

41:17.257 --> 41:18.563
where the two of you kiss.

41:20.260 --> 41:23.219
I'd say he's on your mind,
whether you like it or not.

41:23.263 --> 41:26.396
Yes, but it isn't,
it isn't a good thing.

41:26.440 --> 41:31.924
I mean, I've had this
fearful feeling all day.

41:31.967 --> 41:33.752
Fearful of what might happen?

41:33.795 --> 41:38.365
Well, yes, that, but also...

41:38.408 --> 41:40.410
fearful that...

41:40.454 --> 41:44.110
maybe he would never
ask me again.

41:46.329 --> 41:51.204
Maybe I...
closed the door on...

41:55.164 --> 42:00.256
Juliet, do you want a romantic
relationship with Magnum?

42:01.301 --> 42:04.304
You know it's never too late
to tell someone how you feel.

42:04.347 --> 42:07.786
Well, no, I mean, I can't.

42:07.829 --> 42:10.092
The stakes are too high.
There's our friendship.

42:10.136 --> 42:11.920
Our business.

42:11.964 --> 42:14.401
I mean, once I let
that cat out of the bag,

42:14.444 --> 42:16.534
the-- you-- I can't just
put it back in.

42:16.577 --> 42:18.971
Don't you think
it might just be best

42:19.014 --> 42:21.974
to resist foolish impulses?

42:23.671 --> 42:26.587
What you resist persists.

42:26.631 --> 42:29.329
And I have a feeling that
you've been resisting this

42:29.372 --> 42:31.940
for far longer than
you'd care to admit.

42:31.984 --> 42:34.334
If you and Magnum

42:34.377 --> 42:36.597
are really as close as you feel,

42:36.641 --> 42:39.121
it's important to be honest

42:39.165 --> 42:41.254
with yourself and with him.

42:42.255 --> 42:44.213
There's a lot to risk,

42:44.257 --> 42:46.302
but it's better
than the alternative.

42:46.346 --> 42:48.391
Which is what?

42:48.435 --> 42:51.960
Saying no to
what you really want.

42:53.527 --> 42:56.399
Juliet, what do you want?
