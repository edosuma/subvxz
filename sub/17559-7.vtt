WEBVTT

00:05.588 --> 00:06.548
Oh.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.345
- Morning, sis.
- Morning...sis.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.806
Oh, how's my beautiful,
beautiful

00:14.889 --> 00:16.474
beautiful sister doing?

00:16.558 --> 00:18.810
Okay, I'm scared.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.563
Which makes you even
more beautiful and happy

00:21.646 --> 00:23.815
that I get to go away this
weekend with all of my friends.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.275
Skiing! Whoo-hoo!

00:28.153 --> 00:30.113
Parental supervision
will be provided.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.614
Parents! Whoo-hoo!

00:34.826 --> 00:38.288
Oh...my...God!

00:38.371 --> 00:40.331
Did something happen,
Lauren?

00:40.415 --> 00:42.959
Something so huge
that I am trembling.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.753
The gorgeous lawyer
from my yoga class

00:44.836 --> 00:46.254
finally asked me out.

00:46.337 --> 00:47.756
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

00:47.839 --> 00:49.257
Well, tell us,
how did it happen?

00:49.340 --> 00:50.425
Tell us,
tell us everything.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.886
Oh, well, it was so romantic.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.513
We were both
in the up dog position.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.099
Our breathing, as one.

00:58.183 --> 01:01.019
Our eyes met, and I kind of
gave him one of these.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.230
And then he returned
with one of these.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.236
And then I said,
"If you wanted to ask me out

01:10.320 --> 01:11.362
I wouldn't say no."

01:11.446 --> 01:13.615
And then totally
out of the blue

01:13.698 --> 01:14.824
he asked me out!

01:14.908 --> 01:17.619
(in unison)
Oh, my God!

01:17.702 --> 01:19.662
But I need you to help me.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.748
Okay, done.
What do you want me to do?

01:21.831 --> 01:24.667
Okay, well, normally
when I go out with a guy

01:24.751 --> 01:26.669
the minute there is
an awkward silence

01:26.753 --> 01:29.547
I usually go to that place.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.634
- What place?
- My place.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.677
So I just need you
to help me fill in

01:34.761 --> 01:36.012
those awkward silences.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.807
So would you mind
if I had the date here?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.850
You really like this guy,
don't you?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.352
So much.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.728
Good. Fine.
Bring him on over.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.855
We will talk, talk, talk
all night long.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.649
Okay.
Well, what do we say?

01:47.732 --> 01:49.192
Well, he's a lawyer, right?

01:49.275 --> 01:51.110
Uh, we'll talk about books

01:51.194 --> 01:53.696
and, um, politics,
current events.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.198
Ick!

01:55.281 --> 01:56.616
Got anything else?

01:56.699 --> 01:59.994
Oh, wait a minute.
What am I saying?

02:00.078 --> 02:02.038
You know what you're doing.

02:02.121 --> 02:05.708
I mean, you are the expert
at not sleeping with guys.

02:07.752 --> 02:10.880
You could go months
and months and months--

02:10.964 --> 02:12.215
Okay.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.300
Why don't we just
play it by ear?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.261
Okay, thank you.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.762
Hey, Lauren,
have you had breakfast yet?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.055
Oh, God, no.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.391
I have to lose seven pounds
in nine hours.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.269
Too bad. We're having chocolate
chip pancakes and bacon.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.395
Oh.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.647
Alright, well, no bacon.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.442
You look thinner already.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.910
So I just talked
to my parents.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.787
They said they got a foot
of fresh powder last night.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.914
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

03:25.997 --> 03:28.166
Oh, how much do we love
my boyfriend?

03:28.249 --> 03:31.461
I'll love him more
if his cabin has a Jacuzzi.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.462
Seats 12.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.756
Give me some love!

03:34.839 --> 03:37.175
- Jacuzzi.
- Give me some love!

03:38.635 --> 03:39.636
What's up, guys?

03:39.719 --> 03:40.929
- Vince!
- What's up, Vince?

03:41.012 --> 03:42.805
- What's going on, man?
- Here you go, dude.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.766
Don't lose 'em.
Those are my lucky gloves.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.101
They, uh, touched
many slopes.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.312
Ew!

03:49.395 --> 03:50.939
Where you guys gonna ski?

03:51.022 --> 03:53.107
Hunter Mountain. Cal's parents
have a cabin over there.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.234
Really? I used to teach
snowboarding up there.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.071
Are you kidding? I've been dying
to learn how to snowboard.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.198
Dude, you wanna go?
There's plenty of room.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.492
- You serious?
- Sure.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.910
You guys cool with that?

04:03.993 --> 04:05.578
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah, man, come on, let's go.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.163
Okay, well,
I'm gonna get a drink.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.581
Um, anyone want anything else?

04:08.665 --> 04:09.832
- Cheese fries.
- Cheeseburger.

04:09.916 --> 04:10.959
Coke, no ice.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.627
So, nothing?

04:12.710 --> 04:13.795
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.297
I'm gonna need
that back, dude.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.637
So, who are you gonna Jacuzzi
with? Henry or Vince?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.430
Shh! Don't even
make jokes about that.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.683
- Oh, my God. You invited him.
- No, I did not invite him.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.977
Okay, what was this? "I'm dying
to learn to snowboard."

04:29.060 --> 04:30.687
Okay, Vince and I hung out once.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.188
You know, I wish
I didn't even tell you.

04:32.271 --> 04:33.690
Okay, fine,
so no more Vince feelings?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.692
No, none. Gone.
End of story.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.652
Gotcha. Oh.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.278
- Tina?
- Todd, how are you?

04:39.362 --> 04:41.322
I'm good, I'm good.
You look great.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.075
So do you. Come here,
I want you to meet my friends.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.035
Okay, Todd,
this is Holly

04:46.119 --> 04:49.372
Henry, Gary, Vince,
and my friend Cal.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.290
- What's up, guys?
- What's up Todd?

04:51.374 --> 04:52.500
Look, I got to get going

04:52.583 --> 04:54.085
but it was great
to see you again.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.503
- You too. Bye.
- Bye.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.838
Nice meeting you.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.552
- What?
- Your "friend" Cal?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.345
You introduced me
as your friend?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.556
- Ooh..
- Sookie-sookie now.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.686
Wait. No, no.
No, you know what I meant.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.230
He didn't.
I'm your boyfriend.

05:14.313 --> 05:18.568
No, he saw how I touched you
and went like this.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.236
This freakin' sucks.

05:20.319 --> 05:21.571
I'm taking your friends
to go skiing

05:21.654 --> 05:23.197
and you treat me like dirt?

05:23.281 --> 05:26.534
Oh, God,
you are so overreacting.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.411
Oh, fine, walk away.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.329
And, you know,
you don't have to do me

05:30.413 --> 05:31.956
and my friends any favors.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.459
Nobody wants to go skiing
with a crybaby.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.544
No, I wanna ski with a crybaby.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.005
Sorry, guys.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.339
I wanted to go skiing
with my girlfriend

05:40.423 --> 05:41.924
but apparently
I don't have one.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.092
Trip's off.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.886
- She's sorry!
- No, I'm not!

05:44.969 --> 05:46.637
Shut up, girl!
Cal, come back!

05:48.639 --> 05:50.058
Can you believe him?

05:51.851 --> 05:52.977
What-what do you want me to do

05:53.061 --> 05:54.604
run after him
and say I'm sorry?

05:54.687 --> 05:55.646
- Yes.
- Yes.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.025
Hey, look,
Gary brought him back.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.860
(Holly)
'I bet you
he wants to make up!'

06:00.943 --> 06:02.111
Yeah, forget it.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.656
Tina, Cal loves you so much,
and you love him.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.783
No.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.743
Hey, we spent 150 bucks
on lift tickets.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.036
Go talk to him.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.666
Alright.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.127
It's gonna be fine,
you guys.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.629
I've seen them fight
a million times.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.672
Two seconds,
it'll be all over.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.301
(Vince)
'Uh-oh.'

06:25.384 --> 06:27.220
It's okay. Calm down.
I've seen this, too.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.805
It gets all heated up and, uh

06:28.888 --> 06:30.473
all hell breaks loose,
and then..

06:34.560 --> 06:35.812
That I haven't seen.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.202
Okay, so the guy says
to the librarian..

06:51.285 --> 06:52.662
[whispering]
"Can I get
a double cheeseburger

06:52.745 --> 06:55.790
large fries, and a small coke?"

06:55.873 --> 06:57.250
More! More!

06:57.333 --> 06:58.793
No, no, I can't.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.795
Come on.
You're really funny.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.630
Well, I am kind of on fire.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.342
Oh, man,
I got to get going.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.219
I have to be at court
in the morning.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.555
What did you do?

07:10.638 --> 07:12.056
See? I'm funny, too, huh?

07:12.140 --> 07:14.016
You're great.
You are all great.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.726
I have had
such a fantastic time.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.186
Come on.
I'd better get you home.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.230
- Okay.
- Oh, or, uh..

07:19.313 --> 07:21.774
You could just
stay the night here, Lauren.

07:21.858 --> 07:25.236
Oh, no. It's okay.
We're in a relationship.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.530
Really, it's not
a problem at all.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.990
Uh, Lauren,
I thought you were going

07:29.073 --> 07:31.367
to help me
with my homework.

07:31.450 --> 07:34.912
Yeah. Do you want her
to grow up stupid?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.873
Come on.
I'll walk you to the door.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.375
And then I'll go help
dummy with her homework.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.045
Bye.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.089
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:46.465 --> 07:48.009
Hey, that's my wine!

07:56.976 --> 07:58.728
I'm just saying,
it's not too late

07:58.811 --> 08:01.063
if you apologize to Cal,
we can all go skiing.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.899
No, I did,
but he wouldn't accept it.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.234
Did you actually say
"I'm sorry?"

08:05.318 --> 08:06.903
He wouldn't even let me
get that far.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.905
I said, "Why are you
being such an idiot?"

08:08.988 --> 08:11.199
And he like totally lost it.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.117
So, you're saying
he took "You're an idiot"

08:13.201 --> 08:15.745
as a negative thing?

08:15.828 --> 08:17.413
You know, I don't even wanna
go on this stupid trip.

08:17.496 --> 08:18.414
I hate skiing.

08:18.497 --> 08:19.957
You get cold and wet

08:20.041 --> 08:22.168
and your nose gets all red
and stuff drips out.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.587
- It's disgusting.
- Then why were you even going?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.088
To be with my boyfriend.

08:26.172 --> 08:30.468
That! That! How hard
is that to say boyfriend?

08:30.551 --> 08:33.261
- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you guys been?

08:33.346 --> 08:36.557
Ha, actually,
we were talking to Cal.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.852
He's still going, and he said
we can all go with him.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.313
Fine. Fine. Go.
I don't care.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.529
I..

08:51.989 --> 08:52.949
Uh..

08:53.032 --> 08:55.785
Um...okay, could you
just, uh

08:55.868 --> 08:57.495
excuse us for just a second?

08:57.578 --> 08:58.788
Come here.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.294
- Okay, you have to go.
- I want to, but Tina--

09:05.378 --> 09:06.712
Tina is being stubborn.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.881
Why should we let that
ruin our weekend?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.133
I know, and I wanted
to go away with you.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.426
And you still can.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.511
She just had a fight
with her boyfriend

09:13.594 --> 09:15.304
and she feels really bad.

09:15.388 --> 09:19.558
And it's heart-wrenching,
but these things happen.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.269
Look, if you don't come

09:21.352 --> 09:24.522
then who is gonna wear this?

09:24.605 --> 09:25.606
Huh?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.736
She's gonna be
all alone.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.321
That is her choice.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.322
This is horrible.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.949
Well, you can wear mine.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.452
- It has antlers.
- No!

09:38.536 --> 09:39.912
I feel like I shouldn't..

09:39.996 --> 09:40.955
Oh, God, I don't know.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.748
Holly, Holly, it's simple.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.209
Okay, do you think
she was right?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.335
No.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.463
And do you think
she should apologize?

09:49.547 --> 09:50.506
Yeah.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.134
And do you like Jacuzzis?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.679
Mm-hmm.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.264
Okay, that's it.
I'm going.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.433
- Okay.
- I just have to go tell her.

10:00.516 --> 10:03.352
Okay. Hey, Tina,
so, um, Henry and I..

10:03.436 --> 10:04.395
You're going?

10:04.478 --> 10:07.231
- I didn't say that.
- Are you?

10:07.315 --> 10:08.649
A little.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.900
I can't believe
you would do that.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.360
Okay, just let me explain.

10:11.444 --> 10:15.281
No, you know what?
I think I've heard enough.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.824
And cute hat!

10:19.201 --> 10:20.536
Move!

10:20.620 --> 10:22.079
Girl, you don't know me
like that!

10:35.259 --> 10:36.594
Hey. Good morning.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.221
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.474
You did such a good job
last night.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.017
There was not
one awkward pause.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.728
Oh, you're welcome.
He was easy to talk to.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.229
He comes from such
an interesting family.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.440
Can you imagine six brothers?

10:49.523 --> 10:51.859
He has brothers?

10:51.942 --> 10:54.111
You didn't hear him
say that?

10:54.195 --> 10:57.239
W-we talked about it
for like an hour.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.491
Huh!

11:00.284 --> 11:02.411
But he called me great
and thought I was funny.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.871
Did you hear that?

11:03.954 --> 11:05.956
Yeah, well, you were great.
You were funny.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.210
Then why hasn't he called me?

11:09.293 --> 11:10.294
Why?

11:11.670 --> 11:13.756
Was I too funny?
Was I too great?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.883
Lauren, calm down, okay?

11:15.966 --> 11:18.135
Guys like to wait a day
or two before they call

11:18.219 --> 11:19.595
you know, so they don't
seem desperate.

11:19.678 --> 11:20.596
Okay.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.140
[telephone rings]

11:25.518 --> 11:27.061
Hello?

11:27.144 --> 11:29.230
Oh, um, can you hold on
one second?

11:29.313 --> 11:30.439
It's him!

11:30.523 --> 11:31.982
Oh! Thank God!

11:32.066 --> 11:34.151
He's as desperate as me!

11:34.235 --> 11:35.236
Shh!

11:35.319 --> 11:36.737
I have a boyfriend!

11:36.821 --> 11:38.572
Shh!

11:38.656 --> 11:40.032
Sorry about that, Greg.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.534
Oh, yeah, it was great
meeting you too.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.036
Lots of fun. Um, so, I guess
you want to talk to Lauren.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.121
Okay, give me the phone.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.373
Uh...okay.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.041
Uh, about what?

11:53.170 --> 11:55.423
No, I don't think that would
be a very good idea, Greg.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.799
I have to go. Bye.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.719
Well, what did he say?

12:00.803 --> 12:03.264
I am so sorry.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.933
Is he dying?

12:06.016 --> 12:08.894
Oh, my God.
My soul mate is dying.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.897
No, he's not dying.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.483
Oh. Okay, well,
then what is it?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.111
He asked me to go out
for drinks with him tonight.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.826
I am so, so sorry.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.413
Oh...that is the lowest
thing a man can do.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.124
But, hey, don't you think
it's a good thing

12:30.207 --> 12:32.126
he-he showed you
his true colors now

12:32.209 --> 12:35.129
before you got involved
and got your heart broken?

12:35.212 --> 12:36.797
Huh? Don't you?

12:39.258 --> 12:40.926
You stole my boyfriend!

12:44.638 --> 12:45.973
Will you stop?

12:46.056 --> 12:47.683
I just wanna go away with
my boyfriend for the weekend

12:47.766 --> 12:49.477
and you're making me feel
all guilty about it.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.811
Oh, well, maybe
you feel guilty

12:50.895 --> 12:52.354
because you're guilty
about something.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.899
- What am I guilty about?
- You betrayed me!

12:55.858 --> 12:57.276
You betrayed me!

12:57.359 --> 12:59.028
I tried to help you.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.571
Help me? Ha!

13:00.654 --> 13:01.864
By cuddling up to him

13:01.947 --> 13:04.408
and whispering little jokes
in his ear?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.577
Okay, I didn't cuddle
up to him

13:06.660 --> 13:08.579
and, and that joke
called for whispering.

13:08.662 --> 13:09.872
It was a whisper joke!

13:11.540 --> 13:12.917
I had a fight
with my boyfriend

13:13.000 --> 13:15.669
and as my friend,
you should be on my side!

13:15.753 --> 13:17.213
But even if you were
kind of wrong?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.173
- I was not wrong.
- Oh, come on.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.925
Maybe you didn't introduce Cal
as your boyfriend

13:21.008 --> 13:23.511
because you were leaving
the door open for that Todd guy.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.804
You are doing
the exact same thing!

13:25.888 --> 13:27.389
You know, I think
the reason you wanted to go

13:27.473 --> 13:29.391
skiing so much
wasn't to be with Henry.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.768
It was to be with Vince.

13:30.851 --> 13:31.936
[gasps]

13:33.187 --> 13:34.396
You know what I think?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.940
I think you tried
to steal Greg

13:36.023 --> 13:37.233
because you couldn't
stand the thought

13:37.316 --> 13:38.734
of me being
in a relationship

13:38.817 --> 13:40.486
and you being all alone.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.654
[gasps]

13:43.781 --> 13:45.824
I tell you what,
I will apologize to Cal

13:45.908 --> 13:47.076
if you apologize to Henry.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.244
For what?

13:48.327 --> 13:49.745
For looking at Vince
the way you do.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.080
Okay, you know what?

13:51.163 --> 13:52.748
I used to think you were
crazy when it came to boys

13:52.831 --> 13:53.999
but you're just crazy!

13:54.083 --> 13:56.252
Oh, I'm crazy?
Hi, Vince.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.295
- Hey! Aah!
- Ha!

14:00.589 --> 14:02.258
- Hi, Holly!
- Hi, Lauren!

14:02.341 --> 14:04.885
- God, what is with people?
- I don't know! I hate 'em!

14:04.969 --> 14:07.012
Tina's mad because I wouldn't
let her wreck my ski trip!

14:07.096 --> 14:08.764
Lauren thinks
I stole her boyfriend.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.182
She doesn't even like to ski.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.433
I don't even like
defense attorneys.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.685
God, women are nuts!

14:12.768 --> 14:14.436
Yeah. Well, except for us.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.771
- Yeah, we're the best.
- Yeah.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.160
[phone rings]

14:32.037 --> 14:33.539
(Lauren)
'Hi, this is Lauren.'

14:33.622 --> 14:36.959
'If this is one of my friends,
please leave a message.'

14:37.042 --> 14:39.795
'If it's Val and you're
looking for your knife'

14:39.878 --> 14:41.797
'it's in my frickin' heart!'

14:46.385 --> 14:50.264
Lauren, I'm sensing
you're still mad at me.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.640
But when you're ready
to talk

14:51.724 --> 14:54.393
I made your favorite
peanut butter brownies.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.353
(Lauren)
'Just messenger them over.'

14:59.732 --> 15:02.318
- Hey.
- Hey. You talk to Tina yet?

15:02.401 --> 15:04.778
No, and I'm not going to
until she apologizes to me

15:04.862 --> 15:06.322
I don't need to talk to her.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.948
Yeah.
Maybe she'll calm down.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.492
No, she won't.
She's like a wild animal.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.411
You have no idea
how frustrating it is

15:12.494 --> 15:14.872
to have a friend who's insane.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.081
Maybe I do.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.754
[knock on door]

15:21.837 --> 15:22.963
One sec.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.215
- Hey!
- Hey!

15:25.299 --> 15:26.592
- 'Hi!'
- Hey, Val.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.678
Cal's waiting for us downstairs.
He's got a Hummer.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.890
[gasps]
Upper middle class is the best!

15:32.973 --> 15:34.183
Bye, Val. Have a good weekend.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.392
- I'll see you soon.
- Have fun.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.560
Alright. Oh, and remember

15:36.644 --> 15:38.479
if you do something
before you're ready

15:38.562 --> 15:39.688
you'll get worms.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.359
Oh, here,
I'll get that for you.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.861
- Thank you.
- I got it, got it, got it.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.196
Okay, you got everything?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.369
- You okay?
- You okay?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.829
Yeah. Yeah,
everything's okay.

15:56.955 --> 15:58.540
- Bye, Val.
- Bye-bye.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.459
- Later.
- Be careful.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.175
Hi, this is Lauren.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.928
If this is one of my friends,
please leave a message.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.931
And if this is Val, those pants
you were wearing last night

16:14.014 --> 16:15.766
made you look fat!

16:15.849 --> 16:17.643
Ha ha ha!

16:19.978 --> 16:21.188
[knock on door]

16:26.235 --> 16:27.861
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.659
I brought you your brownies.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.202
- Let me in!
- No!

16:35.285 --> 16:36.912
- Come on, let me in!
- No!

16:36.995 --> 16:38.872
I guess you don't want
hot fudge for your brownies.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.582
- Ooh.
- Ha ha.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.377
I didn't bring any.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.670
Another betrayal.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.469
So how you doing?

16:52.553 --> 16:53.637
I don't know.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.180
How would you feel
if you found out

16:55.264 --> 16:57.599
I was having an affair
with your soul mate?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.311
Okay, you know
I didn't have an affair

17:01.395 --> 17:02.813
with your boyfriend, right?

17:02.896 --> 17:03.814
Mm.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.108
Look, Lauren..

17:07.192 --> 17:09.944
...what that guy did
was horrible.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.488
Okay, but when you think
about it

17:11.571 --> 17:14.031
what did I really do?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.034
Well..

17:16.117 --> 17:18.037
You were funny.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.247
Lauren, what did I do?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.084
You tried to help me.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.127
That's right.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.131
You tried to stop me
from being loose with boys.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.720
And what did you do?

17:34.803 --> 17:37.431
I took out my heartbreak
and pain on you.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.392
I'm afraid so.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.397
I'm really sorry about Greg.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.899
Well, you know, it's okay,
I was probably just

17:46.982 --> 17:48.984
too much woman for him.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.111
Some guys can't handle my heat.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.200
I'm sure that is what happened.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.328
Yeah, and he probably only
asked you out because..

17:59.411 --> 18:01.789
I'm not as hot.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.836
Look, I didn't mean
those things I said, okay?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.922
I just took the breakup
really hard

18:10.005 --> 18:11.965
and then I lashed out at you.

18:12.049 --> 18:15.260
Well, you and Greg
had something very special.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.679
I know.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.765
Was it Greg or Craig?

18:36.406 --> 18:38.075
Can I sit down for a second?

18:38.158 --> 18:39.368
I don't care.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.376
I thought you guys already left.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.379
- I didn't go.
- Oh.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.047
I'm sorry.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.424
[sighs]
Me too.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.135
You know, I don't have
a right to tell you what to do.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.470
It's your life.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.681
They're your boyfriends.

19:00.764 --> 19:01.974
You know, actually,
you were right.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.475
I wasn't being fair to Cal.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.727
I wanted to leave
my options open.

19:05.811 --> 19:09.064
So, when Cal gets back
I'm gonna break up with him.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.233
- You can't break up with Cal.
- Why not?

19:11.316 --> 19:13.318
Because then you won't be
as screwed up as I am.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.778
[laughs]
What?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.531
You were right. I'm so confused
about Henry and Vince

19:17.614 --> 19:19.366
and the only thing
that made me feel better

19:19.449 --> 19:21.702
was knowing that you were
as messed up as I am.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.078
Oh, don't worry about it.

19:23.161 --> 19:25.038
You know that guy Todd?
He has a girlfriend.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.374
So when I hook up with him,
it's gonna be a huge mess.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.417
[both chuckle]

19:28.500 --> 19:30.752
Here's hoping.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.462
Oh, what you're gonna do?

19:32.546 --> 19:33.630
I have no idea.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.758
I mean, I care
about Henry so much

19:36.842 --> 19:41.471
but when I'm around Vince..

19:41.555 --> 19:43.056
I don't know.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.725
What would you do?

19:44.808 --> 19:46.184
Yeah, I'd live in denial
and hope that

19:46.268 --> 19:47.895
my feelings for Vince went away.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.147
Ooh, or I'll make out with Vince

19:50.230 --> 19:52.941
and hope that my feelings
for Henry went away.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.860
See how screwed up I am?

19:54.943 --> 19:56.153
You know,
we'd be perfect together.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.654

19:57.738 --> 19:59.531

20:01.700 --> 20:03.327
[both chuckles]

20:07.331 --> 20:10.250
