00:25.458 --> 00:27.659
Hey.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.613
I had a bad dream.

00:30.648 --> 00:33.498
I saw a ghost.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.870
Oh, no, honey. There's no
such thing as ghosts. Okay?

00:37.370 --> 00:41.141
- Okay.
- Did he look like anybody we know?

00:41.176 --> 00:44.342
No. He was mean
and ugly.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.213
Okay, okay, okay.
Go back to sleep.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.215
Okay.
All right.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.063
Denial, Tom.
It's a bitch.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.833
Shh. Everybody's asleep.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.837
You want me to go in and talk to
Katy? I will. I'll talk to Connor too.

01:10.872 --> 01:12.906
Leave 'em alone.
You're so scary.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.408
Tell me about the kid who blew
his brains out in the rectory.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.411
Come here for a second.
Just for a second. Tommy!

01:18.446 --> 01:20.931
Tommy!

01:20.966 --> 01:23.416
Shh!

01:35.929 --> 01:38.431
Hey, Tommy.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.934
Shh.
How's Sheila doing?

01:50.777 --> 01:54.280
Tommy, I'm gonna go in
and talk to the kids, okay?

02:00.720 --> 02:03.289
Gotcha!

02:27.547 --> 02:30.215
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

02:30.250 --> 02:33.553
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

02:34.053 --> 02:36.788
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

02:36.823 --> 02:39.791
Things were good
when we were young

02:39.826 --> 02:43.162
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

02:43.197 --> 02:46.499
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

02:46.534 --> 02:49.968
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

02:50.003 --> 02:52.939
Things were good
when we were young

02:53.173 --> 02:56.141
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

02:56.176 --> 02:59.345
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

02:59.380 --> 03:02.783
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

03:02.818 --> 03:06.186
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

03:19.699 --> 03:23.136
Jesus, Mike-- Okay. Okay.
Just give me a minute.

03:25.805 --> 03:29.042
Hey, look at this-- a meeting of the
minds, and the minds are a no-show.

03:29.077 --> 03:33.046
I don't suppose anybody made
any coffee. Of course not.

03:33.081 --> 03:35.346
Hmm.

03:35.381 --> 03:39.385
"Tag, arm, it, go."
That's great, guys.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.639
Why even bother
keeping score?

03:43.674 --> 03:47.393
Fell. F-E-L-L.
Read it and weep.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.396
Oh, shit.
How many points?

03:52.398 --> 03:54.866
Eight. No, seven.
Hey, guys.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.320
What's up? Is Laura Miles around?

03:57.355 --> 03:59.739
Yeah, that's me.

04:00.139 --> 04:02.692
- Um, I'm Laura.
- Hi. I'm Angel.

04:02.727 --> 04:05.210
- Nice name.
-Thanks.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.748
Now get the hell outta here. Nobody's
allowed back here as a civilian.

04:08.783 --> 04:11.216
Civilian? I'm not a civilian. Huh?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.254
I'm on the job, Chief.
67 truck downtown.

04:14.289 --> 04:16.523
Oh.
Excuse me one second.

04:16.558 --> 04:18.757
Laura, can we talk somewhere?

04:19.259 --> 04:22.011
Less in the spotlight, yeah.
And, Garrity--

04:22.046 --> 04:24.656
Yes. In the spirit of
helping each other out,

04:24.691 --> 04:27.267
that's for you,
and you can thank me later.

04:27.302 --> 04:29.602
- Nice.
- Let's step out here.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.072
Wow. "Fellatio."
That's cool.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.110
Well, write about
what you know, huh, boys?

04:37.610 --> 04:42.115
That's so cheating. It
really is. And you know what?

04:42.150 --> 04:47.585
Mmm.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.622
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.295
"Autofellatio." The art
of sucking one's own schlong.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.096
And a triple word score.
Well played, my friend.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.134
- Mm-hmm. - Wait. Autofellatio
means you can suck your own schlong?

05:01.169 --> 05:02.600
Yes.
Wow. Shit.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.104
- I thought it meant
gettin' a blow job in a car.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.809
That's funny. You didn't know it
was funny. That's even funnier.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.110
No, I did.
I totally did.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.814
Do you think that's enough?

05:15.181 --> 05:18.484
No. I like your skin
nice and dark.

05:18.851 --> 05:22.255
No, Damien. I swear to God.
Don't even think about it.

05:22.290 --> 05:25.556
- Damien!
- You looked so hot.

05:25.591 --> 05:28.828
Well, you're gonna be looking at the
ceiling in a hospital room, you little prick.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.129
Don't with the swearing,
Debbie.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.916
Cut it out, you
little chunk of shit!

05:33.951 --> 05:36.634
Hey, uh, how do I look
with the hose?

05:36.669 --> 05:41.507
It's a good fit, huh? I'm thinkin'
you might have to get used to this.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.345
Oh, yeah, no.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Never.

05:45.380 --> 05:47.812
Don't even think about it.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.684
There is no goddamn way that you are
ever gonna be a goddamn firefighter.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.519
So get that
right out of your head.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.856
And why not? My father
was a goddamn firefighter.

05:56.891 --> 05:58.858
My grandfather was
a goddamn firefighter.

05:58.893 --> 06:02.128
Yeah, and they're
both dead.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.867
Please don't do this to me.

06:08.101 --> 06:11.436
It's not about you, Mom.

06:11.471 --> 06:15.541
Don't walk away from me, Damien! There's no
goddamn way that you're going to probie school!

06:15.576 --> 06:17.877
Come back here!
I'm talking to you!

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
I gotta call Tommy.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.899
Hey. Hey,Martha Stewart
Living. What the hell is that?

06:39.934 --> 06:42.402
It's the opening of--
She just got out of jail.

06:42.437 --> 06:45.172
I think she was
unjustly convicted.

06:45.207 --> 06:47.872
Hey, what's this
Angel thing about?

06:47.907 --> 06:51.577
Hell if I know. Probie says
a friend of hers set them up.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.931
So you guys are pretty much--
Taking a break, you know?

06:54.966 --> 06:58.251
She doesn't trust me anymore
after the whole poetry thing.

06:58.286 --> 07:00.218
Uh-huh. Yeah.

07:00.253 --> 07:05.024
You, meanwhile, were banging lots of people
behind her back the whole time, right?

07:05.291 --> 07:07.260
Yeah, well,
now it's official.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.263
You know what, Tommy? You ain't
been acting like yourself lately.

07:10.298 --> 07:12.532
Except inside
of burning buildings,

07:12.567 --> 07:14.732
which is a marked
improvement.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.270
I don't know, man. You're happy
you're back with your wife. Whatever.

07:17.305 --> 07:20.106
Mark my words, brother. Stay the
hell away from Laura, asshole.

07:20.141 --> 07:22.407
Asshole?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.909
I walked in on something between
the two of you the other day.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.448
What was that? Huh? No. I explained that.
That was-- I was eating ice cream and had--

07:28.483 --> 07:31.451
Uh-uh.
I had that Biggy Iggy--

07:31.486 --> 07:34.919
Come again, Tom.

07:34.954 --> 07:39.959
Okay. I told-- I told her
the truth about the poetry.

07:39.994 --> 07:42.427
Oh, okay.
The truth, huh?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.429
Now, would this be
the real truth...

07:44.464 --> 07:46.431
or the Tommy Gavin,
reasonable facsimile,

07:46.466 --> 07:49.469
sort of in the ballpark, maybe a
few important details left out truth?

07:49.969 --> 07:52.937
'Cause I've seen that pig before, and
she don't fly. I told her exactly--

07:52.972 --> 07:55.475
I told her about the pills and how the
pills made me write that poem about my wife.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.943
I didn't want to freak her out,
and then you asked me for a poem.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.482
So I gave it to you, and I was just doing
you a favor so you could impress her.

08:02.517 --> 08:06.086
She got the wrong message,
and she thought I was, you know,

08:06.121 --> 08:10.224
trying to send the message
to her, which I said I wasn't.

08:10.259 --> 08:14.327
Mm-hmm. I don't know if I
can believe you on that, Tom.

08:14.362 --> 08:17.163
See, the Tommy Gavin
I used to know...

08:17.663 --> 08:21.667
was a lying, cheating, scheming,
brawling, skirt-chasing son of a bitch.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.920
I looked up to him.
He always knew where he stood.

08:24.955 --> 08:27.673
But this new Tommy,
this fancy coffee-drinking,

08:27.708 --> 08:30.676
pastry-eating, kind,
sweet, sincere one--

08:31.177 --> 08:35.515
Uh-uh, bro. I don't trust
him as far as I can throw him.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.986
Sheil, it's fine.
You know what?

08:43.022 --> 08:46.192
I'm actually surprised that he
didn't bring this subject up earlier.

08:46.227 --> 08:49.327
His father was a firefighter.
His grandfather was a firefighter.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.865
You know what I mean? All right.
I'm gonna be there in five minutes.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.832
Bye.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.703
We gotta go to Aunt
Sheila's house. But, Dad--

08:57.937 --> 09:00.372
Listen to me, okay?
Your cousin Damien...

09:00.407 --> 09:02.773
is thinking about
becoming a firefighter.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.545
I gotta go over there and talk
to him. What about my new mitt?

09:05.580 --> 09:09.013
Connor, listen to me, okay?
In the order of importance,

09:09.048 --> 09:12.051
you getting a new mitt and Damien
thinking about becoming a firefighter--

09:12.086 --> 09:14.387
Damien, firefighter
thing-- up here.

09:14.887 --> 09:18.856
Mitt-- way down here,
below the dashboard, okay?

09:18.891 --> 09:22.395
It's gonna be an hour, and then the
store will be closed like the last time.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.399
I'll-- I'll get you
some ice cream.

09:26.434 --> 09:28.234
No.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.237
You don't want ice cream? No.

09:31.272 --> 09:33.239
Come on.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.709
You gotta talk
some sense into him.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.248
You gotta turn his head around,
because I do not know what I'm gonna do.

09:42.283 --> 09:45.216
Hello, my little sweet pea.
You want some Fruit Loops? Sure.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.588
He already had cereal. I ain't
goin' to any more goddamn funerals.

09:48.623 --> 09:51.090
I've been to enough goddamn
funerals. You can tell him that.

09:51.125 --> 09:55.094
Hey, you look good.
Come on.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.706
This is it, huh?
The conversation?

10:06.741 --> 10:09.208
Yeah. Yeah.
Good. Good.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.711
So, you all right?

10:12.211 --> 10:14.213
Yeah.
You sure?

10:14.680 --> 10:16.681
Yeah.
You seem a little nervous.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.350
No, I'm good. Just--
You know, it's a big moment.

10:19.385 --> 10:23.422
Yeah, it is. It's a big moment.
So, what are you gonna say?

10:23.457 --> 10:27.460
I guess I'm just--
Tell him the truth, right?

10:27.495 --> 10:31.130
Yeah. Good. Right. The truth. Right.

10:31.165 --> 10:32.965
It's me.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.736
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What version
of the truth are we talking about?

10:37.003 --> 10:40.573
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.577
So-- I heard
about Aunt Janet.

10:44.844 --> 10:48.279
That she came back.
That's good.

10:48.314 --> 10:52.151
- Yeah, it's great.
- Yeah, it's better than you and my mom hooking up.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.587
That was kinda tough
to deal with.

10:54.854 --> 10:58.324
Of course, now I'm living in
Dyke Central, so who knows?

10:58.824 --> 11:02.662
I'll probably end up turning into
some gay ax murderer or something.

11:02.895 --> 11:06.265
Well, hopefully not gay.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.000
I'll kill you both
if that happens.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.468
The gay thing
or the ax murderer.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.804
So your mom's telling me
that you're thinking about--

11:13.839 --> 11:18.844
Thinking about it. You know,
maybe a way to connect with my dad.

11:19.345 --> 11:23.516
Well, you know, this is not a
spur-of-the-moment kind of a thing.

11:23.551 --> 11:25.951
What are you doin'?
I know.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.856
- It's some serious shit, you know?
- Hey, my dad's dead.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.324
Died on the job.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.160
And then my uncle,
my dad's best friend,

11:36.195 --> 11:39.198
the guy who showed me how to carry
my dad's helmet the proper way...

11:39.233 --> 11:41.666
when I marched
behind his casket--

11:41.701 --> 11:44.203
He ends up sleeping with my
mom and getting her pregnant.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.708
Listen. No, you listen.
Look, I loved my dad.

11:48.743 --> 11:52.211
His job, what he did,
what you do--

11:52.712 --> 11:54.512
It has an honor to it.

11:54.547 --> 11:58.217
Like no matter how screwed up
your life might be,

11:58.252 --> 12:02.054
when you come home at night,
part of you,

12:02.089 --> 12:04.021
you're satisfied, right?

12:04.056 --> 12:07.560
Like-- Like you know that
at some point during the day,

12:08.060 --> 12:11.564
even if only for a few hours,
you were doing the right thing.

12:11.599 --> 12:13.500
Right?

12:13.535 --> 12:15.366
Yeah.

12:15.401 --> 12:19.905
Yeah, well, that's what
my dad used to say anyways.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.907
Not in so many words.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.909
That's my son.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.347
Yeah, well,
that was before 9/11.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.683
We get paid shit.
We'll always get paid shit,

12:31.183 --> 12:34.086
because the politicians got us by the
balls 'cause we never go on strike.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.220
Jesus Christ, Tommy.
Come on.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.592
Yeah, this country respected us after
9/11. They put the spotlight on us.

12:39.627 --> 12:42.112
But now, because
this country has A.D.D.,

12:42.147 --> 12:44.562
we're back to being
glorified garbagemen--

12:44.597 --> 12:48.100
garbagemen with booze and drug
problems, but garbagemen nonetheless.

12:48.135 --> 12:51.068
Notthisversion
of the truth, okay?

12:51.103 --> 12:55.107
You know what I should do? I should
let you come down to the burn unit...

12:55.142 --> 12:58.075
and see what we're always
this close away from.

12:58.110 --> 13:02.281
Or maybe ride the rig with us for a
couple of days so you can see the shit.

13:02.316 --> 13:05.082
You can see the little kids
with lips so charred...

13:05.117 --> 13:07.953
that when you give 'em mouth-to-mouth,
their lips stick to yours, you know?

13:07.988 --> 13:10.254
Or the dead babies, you know,

13:10.289 --> 13:13.090
who died in their sleep because
the fire spread so quick,

13:13.125 --> 13:16.796
and their backsides are melted
to the mattress underneath 'em.

13:16.831 --> 13:19.565
That's it.
Come on, asshole. Come on.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.967
Sit down!
Sit down, goddamn it!

13:22.468 --> 13:25.304
Um, I am sitting down.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.573
Right.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.710
Good. All right, listen.

13:32.745 --> 13:36.248
That's one side of the coin.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.717
The other side--

13:39.752 --> 13:43.756
There isn't a job on the whole goddamn
planet I'd rather do than this one.

13:45.591 --> 13:50.830
Because every day you do feel
like you made a difference--

13:50.865 --> 13:53.098
like you gave something
back, you know?

13:54.667 --> 13:59.505
I came down here, truthfully,
to talk you out of this,

13:59.540 --> 14:03.943
but... I can't do it.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.079
The fire thing
is in our blood.

14:09.114 --> 14:12.416
It's in our family's...
bones, you know?

14:12.451 --> 14:16.655
My dad was a firefighter.
His dad was a firefighter.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.628
I, uh-- I got something
for you.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.472
That's your dad's badge.

14:33.507 --> 14:35.975
That's my dad's?
Yeah.

14:36.275 --> 14:39.311
I've had it with me
every day since he died.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.849
Even when I'm at work, I keep
it in my, uh, bunker gear.

14:44.283 --> 14:48.888
They gave it to me
to keep for you, in case--

14:51.390 --> 14:54.393
When a guy dies in the line of
duty, they retire his badge number,

14:54.428 --> 14:57.830
and the only person who can
take it after that is his son,

14:57.865 --> 15:02.001
if and when
he decides to come on.

15:04.169 --> 15:07.673
You like it though,
right? The job.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.707
Yeah. I love it.

15:09.742 --> 15:14.580
Even with the-- you know, all the
dead babies and all that other stuff?

15:14.615 --> 15:16.415
Yeah.

15:18.417 --> 15:22.855
- Hey, can I keep this?
- Yeah. That's why I brought it.

15:22.890 --> 15:25.222
Kid, if you really
make the move,

15:25.257 --> 15:28.594
I think you're gonna enjoy
being a firefighter.

15:28.629 --> 15:31.698
There's--
There's nothing like it.

15:31.733 --> 15:34.767
What are we
gonna tell my mom?

15:35.267 --> 15:37.269
I'll take care of your mom.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.074
Thank you, brother.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.446
You had me a little worried there
with the lips and the burn unit thing.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.548
I was just
busting your balls.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.790
Better go give Sheila
the bad news.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.296
Yeah.

16:08.534 --> 16:13.072
Oh, shit. Sean Garrity reading a
book. First sign of the apocalypse.

16:13.107 --> 16:15.873
- What's that?
- Nothing, man. What is that?

16:15.908 --> 16:19.144
Oh, it's-- it's a dictionary. I'm just
boning up for my next game with Laura.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.112
Hey, speaking of which, what's
going on with her and that Angel guy?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.817
- Ah, who knows?
- I wouldn't worry about it. It's obvious what she's doing.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.284
She brings this Ricky
Martin-looking dude around here.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.954
She parades him in front of
everybody, rubs your nose in it.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.491
Some high school bullshit. You think
she's trying to make me jealous?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.494
Yeah, of course. She's just
messing with your brain, dude.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.462
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta meet a hot chick,

16:38.497 --> 16:40.965
bring her around here, let Laura
think she's your new squeeze.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.004
Nah, man. That is-- That's like totally
adolescent. I know. It's cool, right?

16:45.039 --> 16:48.007
- I'm not doing that, Sean.
- Not doing what?

16:48.042 --> 16:50.307
Nothing.
Hey, how are you, Laura?

16:50.342 --> 16:53.178
Hey, how's your friend?
Um, what's his name? Angel.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.145
Angel. Right.
How's that?

16:55.180 --> 16:57.432
None of your business.
I was just asking.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.650
Sean, it's none of your
business. Thank you.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.688
You're welcome. Laura doesn't have
to talk about who she's dating,

17:02.723 --> 17:05.691
just like I don't have to talk
about the new chick I'm seeing.

17:05.726 --> 17:08.659
Right.
You're seeing someone?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.696
Hmm? Oh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, nothing serious.

17:11.732 --> 17:13.699
It could be,
but it's too early to tell.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.665
And what's she like?

17:15.701 --> 17:20.039
Oh, she's, uh-- You know, I don't even
really think we should get into this.

17:20.074 --> 17:22.339
Hey, you got your thing.
I got mine.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.877
Let's just be adults
and give each other some space.

17:24.912 --> 17:26.878
- That's the whole point, right?
- Right.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.719
Yes! Man, I got her.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.721
That was really good, man.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.224
You don't know how good, man. At one point,
her nostrils flared. She is totally bugged.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.227
That's cool. You know what you gotta
do if you really want to get her?

17:42.728 --> 17:44.496
Yeah, I gotta find somebody.
Yeah, somebody ultra hot.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.697
- Yeah, like porn chick hot.
- Exactly.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.699
You know what, man?
Actually, I know this guy.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.570
He knows a ton of porn chicks.
He owes me a favor too.

17:51.605 --> 17:53.405
I'm gonna give him a call.
Whoa. Holy shit.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.706
What?
Well, I know you,

17:55.741 --> 17:57.576
and you know a guy
that knows porn chicks.

17:58.077 --> 18:02.081
So I'm like six degrees from
porn chicks. That's fantastic.

18:02.116 --> 18:05.382
I heard the word "porn."
No, no. We were just--

18:05.417 --> 18:09.219
- Yes, yes, yes.
- You guys talking about porn chicks?

18:09.254 --> 18:12.925
No. No, no. Actually, Franco's thinking about
dating a porn star to make Laura jealous.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.428
No, no, no. Dating a porn chick is
not gonna make a regular chick jealous.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.264
Unless, of course, her sister's
a porn chick. Oh, that could work.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.565
- Hey!
- Hey, Jeannie!

18:21.600 --> 18:26.003
- Hi.
-Surprise, surprise. We're out and about this morning.

18:26.038 --> 18:29.541
Your bride and I made cookies, and we
thought you'd all like a special delivery.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.444
I haven't been here in a million
years. How are you, darling?

18:32.479 --> 18:35.631
Lou, good to see you.
Good to see you too.

18:35.666 --> 18:38.784
You remember him? Of course. Hi, Tommy.

18:39.184 --> 18:42.154
How are the kids? They're
great. They're great.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.824
Oh, and Franco. Sean.
Hi, Jeannie. How are you?

18:44.859 --> 18:47.424
It's amazing.
Oh, the gang's all here.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.962
She's having a good morning. You
want a cup of coffee, sweetie?

18:49.997 --> 18:53.465
Oh, no, we can't. We're gonna
visit her husband at work.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.968
No, honey.
We're visiting your husband.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.238
My husband doesn't work
in this firehouse.

18:59.273 --> 19:01.974
Yes, he does.
He's right here.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.083
Sweetie.

19:11.583 --> 19:14.086
Come on, Jeannie.
We're gonna go.

19:14.121 --> 19:16.553
Come on, sweetheart.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.657
- Bye, Jeannie.
- I'm sorry.

19:19.057 --> 19:20.826
Bye-bye, hon.

19:33.539 --> 19:36.008
Oh, you make me laugh so much.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.277
More wine?

19:38.744 --> 19:41.630
You want me to get that?

19:41.665 --> 19:44.516
Better not. Pour, stud.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.988
Hello? Hey. When?

19:51.023 --> 19:54.026
You want to talk?
I don't think I can.

19:54.061 --> 19:56.493
Why not?
I have company.

19:56.528 --> 20:00.532
Is it important?
Yes, it's very important.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.686
How long?
Oh, at least an hour.

20:03.721 --> 20:06.805
Okay, hold on.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.941
Go.

20:08.976 --> 20:11.043
Okay.

20:11.276 --> 20:15.214
Listen, did you think about
that thing I mentioned to you?

20:16.915 --> 20:20.219
Well, it's important.
I was serious about it, okay?

20:20.254 --> 20:22.554
Okay. Bye.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.142
- Dare I ask?
- F-Bomb.

20:27.177 --> 20:29.860
Says I have to go, now.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.731
It shouldn't come
as a complete surprise.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.566
It was only a matter
of time, right?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.072
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

20:41.573 --> 20:45.577
No. No. You know, I'm not.
I mean, I think it's bullshit.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.013
This asshole makes you drop
whatever the hell it is--

20:48.048 --> 20:50.749
I talked to him, Kenny,
about getting out. And?

20:51.116 --> 20:54.019
He said he'd think about it.
I just reminded him.

20:54.054 --> 20:56.922
You think there's
really a chance?

20:57.289 --> 20:59.223
I don't know.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.725
I told him I'd never
considered it before.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.764
But now, for the first time,
I got a great reason.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.271
Feels good...
being a reason.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.109
Hey.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.112
She's already down. The trip into
the city took a lot out of her.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.579
What were you thinkin'
doing that?

21:22.614 --> 21:25.415
I'm sorry, Jerry. She was very
present, very clear this morning.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.955
Right up until the point where she made me
look like a jackass in front of my whole crew.

21:29.990 --> 21:34.293
So you're more concerned about yourself
than you are about your sick wife?

21:34.328 --> 21:38.231
No. I'm more concerned about
her, which is why I hired you...

21:38.266 --> 21:42.134
to keep an eye on her here,
in her home, where she's safe.

21:42.169 --> 21:45.137
And out of sight.
Excuse me?

21:45.172 --> 21:47.490
It won't happen again.

21:47.525 --> 21:50.084
You bet your ass it won't.

21:50.119 --> 21:52.644
I'll see you in the morning.

21:56.348 --> 21:59.318
The pimp is in the
building, brother. What's up?

21:59.353 --> 22:02.321
Check it out.
Oh, my God. So hot.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.323
Look at that rack.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.827
That's like the nicest pair of breasts I've
ever seen. Whoa. What's goin' on with this dog?

22:08.862 --> 22:11.830
Is she gonna do something with it, or
is it just there? Forget about the dog.

22:11.865 --> 22:14.298
This is her. My friend
set me up with her.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.336
She's coming by tomorrow at 3:00, so we
gotta make sure Laura's in the kitchen.

22:17.371 --> 22:19.803
Are you kidding? What if we're
on a call? I told her to wait.

22:19.838 --> 22:23.008
I talked to her on the phone.
Brother, her voice is like caramel.

22:23.043 --> 22:26.810
It's soft and silky and
gooey. Oh, yeah, daddy. Shit.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.348
Laura's gonna shit when she sees
this chick. Definitely. Definitely.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.351
Hey, what kind of dog is that,
seriously? Hey, watch it, Garrity.

22:32.386 --> 22:35.854
That's my make-believe
girlfriend you're talking about.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.366
What?
What?

22:47.866 --> 22:50.334
That's like the third time
I've caught you looking at me.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.138
I'm not looking at you. What are
you talking about? Yes, you are.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.839
Get outta here. You got
somethin' to say, just say it.

22:55.874 --> 22:59.878
I-- I'm not looking at you. I was
glancing. You are. I just saw you.

22:59.913 --> 23:02.846
Is it against the law to
glance at people? Yes, it is.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.384
What do you wanna tell me? I
don't wanna tell you anything.

23:05.419 --> 23:07.886
You do. Just talk to me.
What? What is it?

23:08.387 --> 23:12.391
Okay, I was trying to tell you something
with the look, okay? Right. I know. Tell me.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.894
I'm trying to tell you that
I don't have a thing for you.

23:15.929 --> 23:18.195
- You don't?
- No.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.697
- Okay, close your eyes.
- What?

23:20.732 --> 23:23.735
Just close your eyes. Trust
me. Two minutes. Come on.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.238
What color are my eyes?
Don't look.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.873
Blue.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.876
- What? Oh, shit, they're green.
- Yeah.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.247
Shit, they're like
almost kelly green. Yeah.

23:35.282 --> 23:38.750
Way off.
Hey, what's wrong?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.718
Well, that's like
the ultimate test, you know?

23:41.753 --> 23:45.690
If you know what color my eyes are, then you've
been looking in them and you're interested.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.660
Oh, right.
I totally flunked it. See?

23:48.695 --> 23:51.596
So why are my signals
so crossed?

23:52.097 --> 23:55.600
Oh, you mean, like-- Well,
you know what I think it is?

23:56.101 --> 24:00.105
I think, uh, men, when it comes
to sex, even if they're in love,

24:00.140 --> 24:02.072
like, they gotta
have some space.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.574
Absence kind of makes
the heart grow fonder.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.279
So all these couples you see
who live and work together--

24:07.314 --> 24:09.448
It never works.
It crashes and burns.

24:09.483 --> 24:11.415
Every single one.
Desi and Lucy.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.453
Uh, J.Lo and Ben,
Matt and Ben, you know?

24:14.953 --> 24:18.457
Siegfried and Roy. Even Liza Minnelli
and that crazy manager homo guy.

24:18.492 --> 24:21.425
You know what I mean?
It always ends the same way.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.963
The acrimonious, you know, divorce
or spiteful separation, you know?

24:25.464 --> 24:29.468
Or, you know, a wild animal bites one
or the other's heads off, you know?

24:29.503 --> 24:33.472
So, Franco, I think, is just probably
feeling like he's suffocating.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.939
You might even be feeling
the same way.

24:35.974 --> 24:39.978
Just be thankful there's not a, you know, wild
animal running around the goddamn firehouse.

24:40.013 --> 24:42.481
You know what I mean? Yeah,
Garrity does have that, like,

24:42.516 --> 24:44.983
"just came off the savanna"
smell now and then.

24:45.018 --> 24:46.985
Yeah. Hey, guys, what's goin' on?

24:47.020 --> 24:48.952
Nothing.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.989
You all right?
Mm-hmm.

24:53.492 --> 24:58.330
Jesus, my neck! I can't believe you let
me spend the entire night in a jail cell.

24:58.365 --> 25:02.834
Well, you're the one who blew our
entire wad on the craps table, fat-ass.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.604
Yeah, well, had I known your
wife kept you on a weekly stipend,

25:05.639 --> 25:08.305
maybe I would've gambled
with more discretion.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.843
Who goes blow job hunting on the boardwalk,
moron? Sure. You tell me that now.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.311
Atlantic City is ruined. Ruined! Yeah?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.681
Yeah. A couple years back,
it was the knob job capital.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.017
You couldn't go there
and not get a knob job.

25:19.052 --> 25:20.984
You get blown
on the way in the cab,

25:21.019 --> 25:23.021
blown getting the luggage
out of the trunk.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.489
You get blown
checking into the hotel.

25:25.524 --> 25:29.277
Stop with the blow job stories. I don't want
the ball and chain to know about this mess.

25:29.312 --> 25:33.031
All right. All right. But I'm writing a
letter to the chamber of commerce down there.

25:33.066 --> 25:35.801
Sweetheart, I'm home.

25:35.836 --> 25:38.502
Hmm.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.540
Well, the keys are here.
Where the hell is she?

25:41.575 --> 25:44.007
Come on.
Get outta here, you guys.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.044
Look at them. They're all
over the place. I know.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.547
Jesus, half my life I prayed
to be knee-deep in pussy.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.014
This ain't exactly
what I had in mind.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.885
I gotta go. Hey, Dad, I'm
leaving. I'll see you later.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.155
No! No!
What? What's wrong?

25:56.190 --> 25:58.390
What's goin' on?
She's dead.

25:58.425 --> 26:00.857
Ah, shit.
Holy shit!

26:00.892 --> 26:03.662
- Is she dead, Son?
- Yeah, slightly.

26:03.929 --> 26:05.897
Get outta here, will you?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.400
That's why she didn't
answer the phone.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.701
She was laying like that
for three whole days.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.906
That explains the cats
eatin' her. I'm gonna be sick.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.207
I didn't know
cats ate people.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.745
I don't think it's high on the list, but
when it's the only item on the menu-- Oh, man!

26:21.246 --> 26:23.748
Well, you can't blame them. Nothing
in their little bellies for three days.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.251
I'm sure she started lookin'
like a Chinese buffet.

26:26.286 --> 26:28.051
Korean.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.689
Oh, wouldn't that be good
right about now?

26:30.724 --> 26:32.889
Do you mind?

26:32.924 --> 26:34.891
Sorry.
I'll be in the kitchen.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.929
I'll call Johnny, see if he can get
one of the guys from the precinct here.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.730
You all right? Yeah. Yeah.
She was a good woman, Tommy.

26:40.765 --> 26:44.269
You said she was a nightmare. Well,
that was before the cats ate her.

26:44.304 --> 26:46.605
Yeah. I mean, all
that money she had--

26:47.105 --> 26:49.608
Yeah, yeah. And then, you know,
she couldn't take care of herself.

26:49.643 --> 26:52.378
Jesus.

26:52.413 --> 26:55.078
Hey. Hey.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.115
You're rich.
Yeah, I'm rich.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.118
No, no, no. You're rich.
You're stinkin' rich.

27:00.153 --> 27:02.621
How much money did she
have? Fifty-six million.

27:02.656 --> 27:06.089
Oh, my God!
Goddamn it, you're rich!

27:06.124 --> 27:09.127
Sixty mil. I mean, I'm
rounding it off, but whoo!

27:09.162 --> 27:11.428
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

27:11.463 --> 27:14.382
We're rich. Hold it, Tommy. Stop it.

27:14.417 --> 27:17.267
You know,
let's honor the dead.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.805
There's a time and place for things
like this. You're right. I'm sorry.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.274
Teddy? Teddy!
Yeah.

27:24.309 --> 27:27.777
Come on. Let's go in the other room.

27:27.812 --> 27:33.283
Now, uh, yeah.
Listen, uh--

27:33.318 --> 27:36.786
We're rich! We're rich!
We're filthy stinkin' rich!

27:36.821 --> 27:39.824
We're rich! We're rich! We're rich!
We're rich! We're rich! We're rich!

27:41.626 --> 27:44.628
I can't.
I gotta get to work.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.165
I'm goin' up to the deli.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.633
Hello?

27:49.668 --> 27:53.672
Hey, uh, it's me. I was in the
neighborhood. I thought I'd take a chance.

27:53.707 --> 27:56.139
Hi.
You alone?

27:56.174 --> 27:58.677
Of course, silly.
Come on up.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.494
Hon, you ready?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.864
The reservation's at 7:30.
Yeah. All set.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.165
What are you doing?

28:22.200 --> 28:25.370
Just making myself
look fabulous for my man.

28:25.405 --> 28:28.171
Doin' a great job of that.
Yeah?

28:28.206 --> 28:30.709
Yeah. Give me two seconds.
I gotta take a piss.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.712
Since when do you--
Just two seconds.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.863
Honey?
Yep.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.900
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi--

28:58.403 --> 29:00.405
Okay.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.826
I have some news.
News?

29:04.861 --> 29:07.746
I talked to F-Bomb again.

29:07.979 --> 29:10.415
He says he's gonna
let me out of my contract.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.668
My God, that's fantastic!
That's-- That's terrific!

29:13.703 --> 29:16.313
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute. It was that easy?

29:16.348 --> 29:18.923
Well, no. I have to
pay him, buy myself out.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.891
How much?
You don't wanna know.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.262
No, I know I don't
wanna know, but tell me.

29:24.662 --> 29:27.098
Thirty thousand dollars.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.399
Are you okay?

29:29.434 --> 29:32.937
Yeah, I think I just-- I better
just sit down. Just-- I'm okay.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.939
Are you sure?
Yeah. Yeah.

29:36.941 --> 29:40.278
Honey, I gotta tell you.

29:40.779 --> 29:44.247
That dress--

29:44.282 --> 29:46.249
Thank you, honey.
Mm-hmm.

29:46.284 --> 29:49.252
Yeah, you look great too.
Yeah, yeah.

29:49.287 --> 29:53.124
Oh, honey, I don't want to get on
you about this, but Connor's mitt--

29:53.358 --> 29:54.858
Oh, I know. I know.

29:54.893 --> 29:58.528
I know you've been busy. I just wanted
to remind you. I promise you tomorrow,

29:58.563 --> 30:02.801
the first thing I'm doing is picking up
that mitt. Okay, I know you will, sweetie.

30:02.836 --> 30:05.136
God, he said
the strangest thing-- Connor.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.604
What? He tells me he's
gonna be a fireman.

30:07.639 --> 30:11.142
When? Today. But it wasn't
like it was a kid saying it.

30:11.177 --> 30:14.110
He was totally serious
and focused.

30:14.145 --> 30:18.650
What did he say? He said that it
was in his blood and in his bones.

30:18.685 --> 30:20.450
Can you imagine?

30:20.485 --> 30:23.953
I don't know where
he's getting that.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.825
Yeah, where do the kids
come up with this stuff?

30:27.058 --> 30:31.596
You know what? It's that
stupid Third Watchshow.

30:32.096 --> 30:34.098
Reruns.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.003
Here. Drink. No. No, thanks,
honey. I'm fine. I'm fine.

30:39.504 --> 30:43.007
It was just
a momentary stroke.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.977
Thirty grand?
Yeah.

30:48.012 --> 30:53.184
I've got five saved, so I guess if I cut
expenses, maybe take on more clients--

30:53.219 --> 30:56.521
No. You know what, Danny?
No more clients, okay?

30:56.556 --> 30:58.523
I'm gonna help you out
with this thing.

30:58.558 --> 31:00.824
No.
No, yes. Yes, I am.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.695
I have cash. I've got it squirreled
away so my wife couldn't get it.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.429
No, Kenny. Yes, Danny.
It's just sitting there.

31:06.464 --> 31:10.869
It's not doing anybody any good.
Kenny, I don't want your money!

31:11.236 --> 31:16.207
This is the only relationship I've had with
a man that didn't involve a cash exchange.

31:16.242 --> 31:19.043
I'd like to keep it
that way.

31:20.378 --> 31:25.216
Well, look. I've got it,
and the offer's on the table.

31:26.484 --> 31:28.319
And I love you for it.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.859
That was a fantastic restaurant. Yep.

31:35.894 --> 31:40.398
You know, we should make it our
regular place. No argument from me.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.902
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

31:43.937 --> 31:45.904
For a great date.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.872
I'm gonna check
on the kids real quick,

31:48.907 --> 31:52.410
and then I'm gonna slip into
something more comfortable.

31:52.445 --> 31:55.879
I like that plan.
A lot.

31:55.914 --> 32:00.383
Hey, Probie.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.385
Hey, I forgot to tell you
the other day.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.924
I found this really neat coffee
place near my new, uh, apartment.

32:05.959 --> 32:08.444
Get this.
They have caramel macchiatos.

32:08.479 --> 32:10.894
And, uh, it's like
a Snickers bar in a cup.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.182
Wow. I'm thinking maybe I'll
bring some to work, you know?

32:14.217 --> 32:17.435
Or you know what I'll do? I'll
bring some to the hockey game.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.903
The guys would
like that, right?

32:19.938 --> 32:22.440
Um, Tom, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

32:22.475 --> 32:25.944
Why? The reason
I'm calling is--

32:26.444 --> 32:29.913
This-- This isn't
how I feel.

32:29.948 --> 32:34.035
How you feel about what?
Well, it's just the team.

32:34.070 --> 32:37.681
I mean, Mungo and Ryan mostly,
but the other guys too.

32:37.716 --> 32:41.292
They, uh-- They don't want
you to be captain anymore.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.796
They think
you've gone soft.

32:44.831 --> 32:46.763
Hello?
I'm here.

32:46.798 --> 32:50.301
They actually don't
even want you to play.

32:50.336 --> 32:53.321
Mungo and Ryan said
that if you show up,

32:53.356 --> 32:56.272
they were gonna sit
the game out in protest.

32:56.307 --> 33:01.312
They got Turk Pollatta and Wildman
Iaco to come down and coach.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.279
Those guys are
completely out of control.

33:03.314 --> 33:07.151
All right, you know what? You tell those
assholes that not only am I gonna be there, okay,

33:07.186 --> 33:09.153
but I'm gonna be there and
kick some ass, all right?

33:09.654 --> 33:12.889
- Wait. Wait. Tom?
- What?

33:12.924 --> 33:15.927
Um, are you still gonna bring some
of that Snickers-flavored coffee?

33:15.962 --> 33:18.795
You know what, asshole?

33:18.830 --> 33:23.334
The only thing I'm bringing
is my "A" game, okay?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.981
I'm sorry.
Do we live in Paris?

33:38.016 --> 33:41.519
No. Good morning, hon.
Hey, breakfast is almost ready.

33:41.554 --> 33:43.486
Why didn't you
wake me up? Huh?

33:43.521 --> 33:45.989
Because when I got up at 4:00,
you were still awake.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.027
I thought you could use the extra
z's. Now I'm late for work. Perfect!

33:49.062 --> 33:51.529
It's all right, honey.
Just use a glass.

33:51.564 --> 33:55.033
No time for glasses.
What's this?

33:55.068 --> 33:57.500
Huh?
Uh, it's orange juice.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.872
Yeah. What's it say above
"orange juice" on the carton? Huh?

34:00.907 --> 34:03.172
Home-style? Which is a
code word for what? Pulp.

34:03.207 --> 34:07.176
Okay, I hate pulp. All right?
Since when do you hate pulp?

34:07.211 --> 34:10.047
Since they started taking the
time to take the goddamn pulp out.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.014
Christ.
Honey, I'm sorry.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.053
I didn't know you had a thing with
the pulp. Yeah, I hate all pulp, okay?

34:15.088 --> 34:17.554
Orange juice pulp, that stupid
British band named Pulp,

34:17.590 --> 34:19.522
Pulp Fiction,
Quentin Tarrantino--

34:19.556 --> 34:22.976
What's with that goddamn head? Is that not
the biggest head in the history of heads?

34:23.012 --> 34:26.397
He turns sideways, it's like you're looking
at a map of the New Jersey coastline.

34:26.431 --> 34:29.067
Kill Bill. What a piece of
shit. And there's aKill Bill 2?

34:29.101 --> 34:31.168
What's that about?
Jesus Christ.

34:31.204 --> 34:33.369
Tommy, the kids.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.908
Kids, when you grow up, don't
see either one of theKill Bills.

34:36.943 --> 34:39.678
They both suck, okay?
See ya.

34:39.713 --> 34:42.481
Have a nice day, honey.
Uh-huh.

34:42.516 --> 34:45.214
Do you hear that
crackling sound?

34:45.248 --> 34:48.217
That's the sound of my
ovaries drying up. Come on!

34:48.252 --> 34:52.255
All right. All right. Here we go. How
about this? Huh? What do you think?

34:52.757 --> 34:56.225
"Cock" again? What? You
can't use the same word twice?

34:56.260 --> 34:59.263
Oh, sure you can. Especially
if it has more than one meaning.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.432
Right.
Such as?

35:04.268 --> 35:06.370
Uh--

35:06.637 --> 35:10.875
If this is gonna turn into 20 questions,
that's a whole other ball of wax.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.344
Oh, that's very funny.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.511
Hi. Is Franco here?

35:15.546 --> 35:18.581
Yeah. I'm Franco. Hey. How you doin'?

35:18.616 --> 35:22.251
Thanks for comin' by. Good to see
you. Where are we going tonight?

35:22.286 --> 35:25.790
Oh, I-- I hadn't really-- I hadn't
given it a lot of thought, but, um--

35:26.190 --> 35:27.690
Come on in here, darling.
Don't be shy.

35:27.725 --> 35:31.129
No. Remember you said, Chief, no civilians
in the kitchen. It's really not safe.

35:31.164 --> 35:33.965
That doesn't mean it applies to pretty
girls. Come on in here, sweetheart.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.265
What is your name?

35:36.300 --> 35:39.637
Hi. I'm Chrissy.
You guys do such great work.

35:39.672 --> 35:42.939
It is an honor to meet you.
A huge honor.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.977
Yeah, you might even say
it's an enormous honor.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.814
Um, I'm Laura.
It's so nice to meet you.

35:50.047 --> 35:53.183
Welcome. What are you guys gonna
do tonight? A little dancing?

35:53.218 --> 35:56.320
Yeah. You know, maybe we'll
hit the club or something. Yeah.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.824
Whatever you wanna do.
You ready? After you.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.791
Bye.
Bye.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.828
Take care.
Bye now.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.801
All right, guys.
Listen up. Listen up.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.303
First line starts--
Davis, Jacobs, Callahan.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.341
And on defense-- O'Leary and
Reilly, you're in for Gavin.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.946
Hey, look who it is--
Dorothy Hamill.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.182
Holy shit!

36:25.516 --> 36:29.287
Anybody else?
Didn't think so.

36:39.864 --> 36:43.166
- Hello?
- Hey, you still on your date?

36:43.201 --> 36:46.204
Uh, no. We, uh--
We wrapped things up early.

36:46.704 --> 36:50.708
- Good. We gotta talk.
- Okay.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.222
Get him! Get him! Beat his
ass! I got him! Hold him!

37:12.063 --> 37:14.697
- Whoo!
- Good shot!

37:14.732 --> 37:18.034
Tommy! Yes!

37:18.069 --> 37:20.870
The matching hat trick. Is it
wrong to feel sorry for the cops?

37:20.905 --> 37:23.674
Yeah, but tonight I'll make an
exception. We should've bet this game.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.910
You're real hot shit,
huh, Gavin? Oh, yeah.

37:25.945 --> 37:27.578
Yeah.

37:31.182 --> 37:35.218
-Go get him, Tommy.
- All right. You're off the ice.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.256
- The bitch is back.
-Penalty Gavin. Five minutes. Fighting.

37:40.558 --> 37:42.892
Shit.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.430
Attaboy, Tom. Show 'em who's
boss. I'm the goddamn boss.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.165
Yeah. Show 'em.
Christ.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.733
Goddamn right, you are.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:50.768 --> 37:53.069
Look at Collins making
a fool of you out there.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.606
How could you take that from
him? He's making a fool out of me?

37:55.641 --> 37:57.775
He's really in the zone,
huh? Yeah,The Twilight Zone.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.544
-Who the hell is he talkin' to?
- No idea.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.947
That's right, Tommy.
Use that anger. Shut up!

38:03.347 --> 38:06.651
Yeah, yeah. Where's it been all this
time, huh? You know where it's been.

38:06.686 --> 38:10.721
Tommy, don't be a pussy! Go out
there and kick all their asses!

38:10.756 --> 38:13.723
Come on, Tommy!

38:13.758 --> 38:16.627
Go out there and get
that college guy.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.304
Come on! Come on!

38:38.582 --> 38:41.752
- Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
- Happy now, asshole?

38:41.787 --> 38:45.156
Look at the scoreboard.

38:49.527 --> 38:53.331
I hope they got an ambulance standin'
by. I'm gonna call 911 right now.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.135
Hey, Tommy, great job.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.423
Tommy, man, all these cars belong
to the cops. Let's trash 'em.

39:02.458 --> 39:05.676
Let's get 'em, Tommy. Come on.
Come on! Where you goin', man?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.643
Tommy, where you goin'?

39:07.678 --> 39:11.182
I need a new direction

39:12.683 --> 39:16.152
To get me around

39:16.187 --> 39:20.691
You don't have protection

39:22.193 --> 39:25.161
As you're coming down

39:25.196 --> 39:27.698
Have you made up your mind

39:28.199 --> 39:30.166
It's the only way

39:30.201 --> 39:34.705
Have you made it up
Have you made it up

39:35.206 --> 39:38.674
I admire the time
that you take

39:38.709 --> 39:42.178
Tommy! Where
are you going, man?

39:42.213 --> 39:45.216
You got sand in your vagina?
You can't get away from me!

39:45.716 --> 39:49.220
I own you.
Walk away. Walk away.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.691
Hiya, Tommy.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.693
Where are you going,
asshole? Huh?

39:57.728 --> 40:00.481
You're running away
like a little bitch!

40:00.516 --> 40:03.199
Go back there
and finish the job, huh?

40:03.234 --> 40:08.239
You're with us now.
Come on. Come on, Tommy.

40:14.245 --> 40:19.250
I need a good luck charm

40:21.252 --> 40:24.220
To give me good luck

40:24.255 --> 40:29.260
And I need a good alarm

40:31.262 --> 40:33.264
To wake me up

40:36.767 --> 40:39.235
Hey.
Dad.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.237
Look what I got you.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.774
Oh, my God.
See the mitt?

40:44.275 --> 40:46.242
That's awesome.
Yeah.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.530
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, sweetheart.

40:49.565 --> 40:52.783
Connor got a bike
and a mitt?

40:54.785 --> 40:57.788
Yeah, but look
what I got for you.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.790
Look at that.
Wow!

41:00.291 --> 41:01.757
Huh?
Thanks, Daddy.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.795
You're welcome.
She gets a PSP?

41:04.830 --> 41:06.797
You got a bike
and a mitt.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.634
You know, when I was
a kid-- Yeah, I know.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.137
There were only four
channels on the TV.

41:13.172 --> 41:14.906
That's right.
Thanks, Dad.

41:14.941 --> 41:16.640
Okay. Good night, guys.

41:18.142 --> 41:21.145
- I get to use her PSP, right?
- Can I ride his bike sometimes?

41:21.180 --> 41:23.647
Good night.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.821
Hey.
Hey.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.823
Come on in, man.
What's up?

41:33.324 --> 41:35.826
What's going on? I just wanted
to ask you a couple questions.

41:35.861 --> 41:38.329
Did you, uh, happen to mention
to Laura that I was suffocating?

41:38.364 --> 41:41.797
Um, yeah, I did,
I think. Yeah.

41:41.832 --> 41:45.336
And that our relationship was somehow related
to the one that Siegfried has with Roy?

41:45.836 --> 41:48.839
Yes. I was making--
making a point.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.841
Hey, do you want some--

41:53.844 --> 41:58.349
Light my white candle
Keep me safe

42:02.353 --> 42:06.390
It'll put that smile
back on my--

42:48.198 --> 42:49.567
Cloudland.
