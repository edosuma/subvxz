00:39.434 --> 00:41.768
Roses, a dozen.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.454
I know.

00:43.456 --> 00:45.739
He said he was heading to his
girlfriend's house

00:45.741 --> 00:47.241
and she cancelled on him.

00:47.243 --> 00:48.775
No, didn't even tell me
his name.

00:48.777 --> 00:50.744
Just said he didn't want them
to go to waste.

00:52.248 --> 00:53.464
It was nice.

00:53.466 --> 00:55.883
It's been a lousy week.

00:55.885 --> 00:58.585
Maybe things
are finally turning around.

01:01.574 --> 01:03.507
Tragic news out of Manhattan
this evening,

01:03.509 --> 01:06.744
where a young woman was pushed
in front of a subway train.

01:06.746 --> 01:08.762
Seriously, you guys have, like,

01:08.764 --> 01:09.980
the cutest
kids in New York.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.098
It's true.

01:12.101 --> 01:13.633
Who knew these
guys back in college

01:13.635 --> 01:15.602
would be
such a baby factory?

01:15.604 --> 01:17.070
Me, I did.

01:17.072 --> 01:19.323
Right after I caught
them having sex in my bed.

01:19.325 --> 01:20.441
One time, freshman year.

01:20.443 --> 01:21.575
You must move on.

01:21.577 --> 01:23.026
Yeah, and let's be honest,

01:23.028 --> 01:24.578
that is the most action that
bed saw all year.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.746
Ouch.

01:25.748 --> 01:27.614
Are you going
to be able to make it

01:27.616 --> 01:28.949
to Sammy's
birthday party on Saturday?

01:28.951 --> 01:30.451
2:00, yes.

01:30.453 --> 01:32.252
I am wrapping up
with my client on Friday

01:32.254 --> 01:34.338
and I may be able
to help and come set up.

01:34.340 --> 01:35.706
How is that going,
by the way?

01:35.708 --> 01:37.491
The companionship thing.

01:37.493 --> 01:40.043
If by "thing",
you mean career,

01:40.045 --> 01:42.045
it is going really well.

01:42.047 --> 01:45.466
I-I-I don't know, I've
worked with some amazing people.

01:45.468 --> 01:47.301
I think it's incredible,
what you're doing.

01:47.303 --> 01:49.186
I mean, you walk away from
being a doctor,

01:49.188 --> 01:50.670
find a new way to help people?

01:50.672 --> 01:52.272
Same old Jo.

01:52.274 --> 01:54.308
Sweet.

01:54.310 --> 01:55.309
To Joan.
To Joan.

01:55.311 --> 01:56.343
And the baby.

01:56.345 --> 01:59.530
And the baby!

02:02.485 --> 02:04.651
Oh, sorry, guys, this is,
um, one of the rehab facilities

02:04.653 --> 02:06.203
that, um, refers me
to other clients.

02:06.205 --> 02:07.354
I should take it.

02:07.356 --> 02:08.687
I'll be right back.

02:08.690 --> 02:11.825
This is Joan Watson.

02:11.827 --> 02:15.045
Joan, this is
Dr. Caruso at Hemdale.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.030
I sent you a case file
a little while ago.

02:17.032 --> 02:18.665
I was wondering if you had
a chance to look at it?

02:18.667 --> 02:21.251
I'm just opening it right now.

02:21.253 --> 02:22.803
The patient in question

02:22.805 --> 02:24.538
completes his stay with us
on Monday.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.374
His father expressed some
concerns about life post-rehab,

02:27.376 --> 02:29.977
so, I recommended a companion.

02:29.979 --> 02:32.179
He looked at some resumes
and chose you.

02:32.181 --> 02:35.265
So, can I tell him
the interest is mutual?

02:35.267 --> 02:37.651
Sure, I just have one question.

02:37.653 --> 02:39.853
Uh, what kind of name
is Sherlock?

03:14.473 --> 03:17.190
I can't do this.

03:17.192 --> 03:18.392
Ah, just shut it off.

03:20.262 --> 03:21.812
Can't let
the noise get to you.

03:21.814 --> 03:23.763
You know this.
I know.

03:23.765 --> 03:25.949
But you did better
with the lock this time.

03:25.951 --> 03:29.202
It only took you six seconds.

03:29.204 --> 03:30.770
How weird is this?

03:30.772 --> 03:31.872
You're Sherlock's sponsor

03:31.874 --> 03:33.490
and I'm his sober--

03:33.492 --> 03:36.076
well, I <i>was</i> his sober
companion-- until recently.

03:36.171 --> 03:38.872
And now you're teaching me
how to break into cars.

03:38.874 --> 03:41.090
You want to do
the kind of work he does.

03:41.092 --> 03:42.876
Besides, every hour
I spend with you,

03:42.878 --> 03:44.577
he's got to do two with me.

03:44.579 --> 03:46.045
How's that going?

03:46.047 --> 03:47.046
He's good.

03:47.048 --> 03:48.348
He's in a good place.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.216
Happier since you
decided to work with him.

03:54.922 --> 03:56.639
Hey, I gotta go.

03:56.641 --> 03:59.225
I'll give you a ride.

04:03.864 --> 04:05.198
Dreadful news:

04:05.200 --> 04:06.399
I heard from my father
this morning.

04:06.401 --> 04:07.567
Really?

04:07.569 --> 04:08.785
Not the man himself,
of course.

04:08.787 --> 04:10.320
One of his minions.

04:10.322 --> 04:12.104
Apparently, he's holding me
to the bargain

04:12.106 --> 04:14.123
that we struck when I borrowed
that pittance from him.

04:14.125 --> 04:16.075
If you're referring
to the $2.2 million

04:16.077 --> 04:18.611
that you borrowed to pay off
the kidnapping ransom,

04:18.613 --> 04:20.079
I'd say that's a
little more than a pittance.

04:20.081 --> 04:21.464
I foiled that kidnapper.

04:21.466 --> 04:22.799
Every penny was accounted for
and returned.

04:22.801 --> 04:24.116
Yeah, but still.

04:24.118 --> 04:25.301
You're off his teats now,
Watson,

04:25.303 --> 04:26.836
you can stop taking his side.

04:26.838 --> 04:28.454
What did he want?

04:28.456 --> 04:30.890
Uh, to meet with
one of his many attorneys

04:30.892 --> 04:34.477
this morning and discuss work
of an investigative nature.

04:34.479 --> 04:37.480
Knowing Father, the man
is a shyster's shyster.

04:37.482 --> 04:39.148
You know, Dad once
helped defending a client

04:39.150 --> 04:42.068
who was equal parts
Adolf Hitler and Bernie Madoff.

04:42.070 --> 04:43.987
Hey, does your father
know that I'm still here

04:43.989 --> 04:45.104
and that we're
working together now?

04:45.106 --> 04:46.356
Why would he care?

04:46.358 --> 04:47.774
I don't know,
I was just curious.

04:47.776 --> 04:49.659
You're an aspiring
detective now, Watson.

04:49.661 --> 04:52.144
Apply your
curiosity to your cases.

04:55.266 --> 04:56.599
Impressive.

04:56.601 --> 04:58.451
I know; I could look
at this all day.

04:58.453 --> 05:00.503
No, I was talking
about the glass.

05:00.505 --> 05:02.672
It's... bullet-proof.

05:02.674 --> 05:05.591
Six-inch glass-clad
polycarbonate, hmm.

05:05.953 --> 05:07.787
Mr. Holmes.

05:07.789 --> 05:09.372
Philip Armistead.

05:09.374 --> 05:10.522
Do you know that "shyster"

05:10.524 --> 05:13.909
is German for
"one who defecates"?

05:15.579 --> 05:17.463
And this is
my assistant Rebecca.

05:17.465 --> 05:19.749
So, let's cut to the proverbial
chase, shall we?

05:19.751 --> 05:21.467
How much slime
will my associate and I

05:21.469 --> 05:23.219
have to wade through in order
to help you?

05:23.221 --> 05:24.970
My father said you were
in need of my services.

05:24.972 --> 05:27.706
You're an attorney, you work
for him, he values you:

05:27.708 --> 05:29.141
three good reasons to assume

05:29.143 --> 05:31.227
that the work we will have to do
will be vile.

05:31.229 --> 05:35.481
Actually, I was hoping you
might be able to help Rebecca.

05:35.483 --> 05:37.183
My sister Callie...

05:37.185 --> 05:39.268
she went missing
almost six months ago.

05:39.270 --> 05:41.771
I'm worried her husband may
have done something to her.

05:44.391 --> 05:50.913
Uh, I guess I should start with
"I'm sorry."

05:50.915 --> 05:53.099
I hate that I can't say these
things to you face-to-face.

05:53.101 --> 05:54.367
It's just...

05:54.369 --> 05:59.839
I don't love you anymore, Drew.

05:59.841 --> 06:03.509
And it hurts to say that,
you don't know how much.

06:03.511 --> 06:07.012
I care about you,
I want you to be happy,

06:07.014 --> 06:09.882
but I need to be happy, too.

06:09.884 --> 06:11.517
And I thought that
I could tough it out

06:11.519 --> 06:14.053
and give us both
a little more time.

06:14.055 --> 06:16.856
But then that woman got pushed
in front of a subway train

06:16.858 --> 06:19.475
the other day-- the woman with
the flowers--

06:19.477 --> 06:22.528
and, I don't know, I couldn't
stop thinking about her.

06:22.530 --> 06:24.763
Life is too short
to stay with someone

06:24.765 --> 06:26.732
who doesn't make you happy.

06:26.734 --> 06:30.503
So, uh, I'm going to go away
for a little while.

06:30.505 --> 06:32.688
I don't know where and I-I don't
know for how long.

06:32.690 --> 06:34.457
I just know
that I need some time.

06:35.942 --> 06:37.293
Maybe, someday, you'll find it

06:37.295 --> 06:39.295
in your heart to forgive me.

06:41.248 --> 06:44.083
When my brother-in-law Drew
first showed me the video,

06:44.085 --> 06:45.551
I didn't question it.

06:45.553 --> 06:48.220
Callie had always
been a little fragile.

06:48.222 --> 06:50.389
Packing up her stuff
and hiding out for a while,

06:50.391 --> 06:51.957
that sounded like her.

06:51.959 --> 06:55.094
But then after the days started
turning into weeks,

06:55.096 --> 06:56.562
I got suspicious.

06:56.564 --> 06:58.681
The marriage
was... troubled?

06:58.683 --> 07:00.466
Callie had left him once before.

07:00.468 --> 07:01.517
That was about a
year and a half ago.

07:01.519 --> 07:03.018
What happened?

07:03.020 --> 07:05.187
I don't know.
Callie didn't even tell me

07:05.189 --> 07:06.605
she'd done it
till a few weeks later,

07:06.607 --> 07:08.140
and by then,
she and Drew were back together.

07:08.142 --> 07:10.526
And I tried to
get her to talk about it,

07:10.528 --> 07:12.811
but she said it
was all in the past.

07:12.813 --> 07:14.163
She was like that--

07:14.165 --> 07:15.915
she kept everything
bottled up; private.

07:15.917 --> 07:18.484
So, when she
didn't return my phone calls

07:18.486 --> 07:21.036
after Dr showed me the video,
I wasn't surprised.

07:21.038 --> 07:23.655
After a few weeks,
Rebecca went to the police.

07:23.657 --> 07:26.375
Th tried to locate
Callie via her cell phone,

07:26.377 --> 07:27.593
credit card,
e-mail records,

07:27.595 --> 07:29.512
but they came up empty.

07:29.514 --> 07:32.381
She hadn't used any of them
since before she disappeared.

07:32.383 --> 07:34.884
They questioned Drew, but
he managed to convince them

07:34.886 --> 07:36.218
the video was authentic.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.387
Oh, you-you
think it's a fake?

07:38.389 --> 07:41.440
I think things were bad between
Drew and my sister.

07:41.442 --> 07:43.225
He could've forced her
to make the video

07:43.227 --> 07:44.777
so that,
after he killed her,

07:44.779 --> 07:46.946
he could show it to the police
and convince them

07:46.948 --> 07:48.147
that she'd run away.

07:48.149 --> 07:49.482
Which he did.

07:49.484 --> 07:50.816
There's also the trunk.

07:52.819 --> 07:54.537
It was our grandmother's.

07:54.539 --> 07:57.689
My father willed
it to me before he died.

07:57.691 --> 07:59.325
My apartment
is tiny, so I let Callie

07:59.327 --> 08:00.543
keep it at her place.

08:00.545 --> 08:01.794
The deal was,

08:01.796 --> 08:04.079
she would give it
to me if I ever moved.

08:04.081 --> 08:05.548
The first time that I went

08:05.550 --> 08:07.216
to see Drew
after she disappeared,

08:07.218 --> 08:09.585
I realized that
the trunk was gone, too.

08:09.587 --> 08:11.136
He claimed that
she took it with her,

08:11.138 --> 08:12.721
but I know that
she would never do that.

08:12.723 --> 08:15.374
I told the police that I think
he did what he did.

08:15.376 --> 08:17.426
And he used the
trunk to get rid of her.

08:17.428 --> 08:18.727
I've had the firm's
top investigators

08:18.729 --> 08:20.312
on this for months.

08:20.314 --> 08:22.714
They haven't managed to
come up with anything.

08:22.716 --> 08:24.049
I happened to speak with
your father the other day,

08:24.051 --> 08:26.185
and he recommended
I reach out to you.

08:26.187 --> 08:28.270
Would you excuse us
for just one moment?

08:28.272 --> 08:30.022
Come on.

08:30.024 --> 08:31.690
That woman
could not be more wrong

08:31.692 --> 08:33.107
about her sister's video.

08:33.110 --> 08:35.277
It was most certainly
not made under duress.

08:35.279 --> 08:36.828
Tell me.

08:36.831 --> 08:38.581
The human face, Watson,
is like the penis.

08:38.582 --> 08:39.898
Or so said the great

08:39.900 --> 08:41.534
personality theorist
Silvan Tomkins.

08:41.535 --> 08:43.034
The point being:

08:43.037 --> 08:44.753
the face,
like the male member,

08:44.755 --> 08:46.589
has a mind of its own;
it betrays us

08:46.591 --> 08:49.908
on an almost daily basis;
advertises our secrets

08:49.910 --> 08:51.260
to those
who know that to look for.

08:51.262 --> 08:52.845
The woman in that video
was utterly calm

08:52.847 --> 08:54.380
when she filmed it.

08:54.382 --> 08:56.549
More than that, I think she was
excited to move on.

08:56.551 --> 08:58.851
You and I were not
looking at the same video.

08:58.853 --> 09:00.052
Her jaw muscles
were relaxed, not tight.

09:00.054 --> 09:01.353
Her nose wings
were not dilated.

09:01.355 --> 09:02.555
She wasn't going
off some script,

09:02.557 --> 09:04.223
she meant every
word she was saying.

09:04.225 --> 09:05.160
Nose wings.

09:05.185 --> 09:06.610
We have an opportunity
here, Watson.

09:06.611 --> 09:09.028
More precisely, you do.

09:09.030 --> 09:11.814
I think this would make
an excellent first case for you.

09:11.816 --> 09:14.650
You want me to find Callie
Burrell on my own?

09:14.652 --> 09:16.702
Every good investigator needs
to be able to find people

09:16.704 --> 09:18.237
who do not wish to be found.

09:18.239 --> 09:19.655
More often than not,
those are dangerous criminals.

09:19.657 --> 09:23.576
Ms. Burrell is merely a wife
grown tired of her husband.

09:23.578 --> 09:25.244
It's a case
with training wheels.

09:25.246 --> 09:27.046
You can't be sure
that Callie is okay.

09:27.048 --> 09:28.614
And, you know what,
th-th-there might be something

09:28.616 --> 09:30.049
to what her sister is saying.

09:30.051 --> 09:33.285
Maybe, maybe not.
Your job to find out.

09:33.287 --> 09:35.721
Is this because the case
came through your father?

09:35.723 --> 09:38.457
No, it's because the case
suits you.

09:38.459 --> 09:41.960
Besides, I have one of my own
which I wish to take up.

09:43.647 --> 09:45.797
Oh, that's the woman that Callie
mentioned in her video.

09:45.799 --> 09:48.150
She was murdered
just days before Callie

09:48.152 --> 09:50.402
quote-unquote vanished.

09:50.404 --> 09:52.104
The man who pushed her
was never found.

09:52.106 --> 09:54.490
I lost a valued informant
to a pusher back in London

09:54.492 --> 09:56.609
Ugly business, yeah.

09:56.611 --> 09:58.410
As horrific a death
as you can imagine.

09:58.412 --> 10:00.079
Now, I found that killer.

10:00.081 --> 10:02.498
I suspect I can
find this one as well.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
Hey, aren't
you going to tell

10:04.502 --> 10:06.168
your father's friend what we're doing?
Your case now, Watson.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.486
You tell him.

10:20.525 --> 10:22.161
I must confess,
I'm quite embarrassed

10:22.162 --> 10:26.415
this murder escaped my attention
when it first transpired.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.850
I was still locked away in
Hemdale at the time.

10:28.852 --> 10:31.319
"Locked away" is
a little exaggerated.

10:31.321 --> 10:32.921
When in days of my arrival,

10:32.923 --> 10:35.090
the staff forbade me access
to newspapers.

10:35.092 --> 10:38.143
Something about
police blotters riling me.

10:38.145 --> 10:40.896
No, you?
Curious case, this one.

10:40.898 --> 10:42.046
Man approaches woman.

10:42.048 --> 10:43.598
Man gives woman flowers.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.601
And walks away,
only to return moments later

10:46.603 --> 10:49.488
and push woman
in front of train.

10:49.490 --> 10:51.523
It's pretty obvious
the guy's a psychopath.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.408
Likely, yeah.

10:53.410 --> 10:55.610
Obvious, no.

10:55.612 --> 10:58.346
He takes great care
to keep his face

10:58.348 --> 11:01.032
angled away from the platform
security cameras.

11:01.034 --> 11:03.452
Speaks to premeditation.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.203
He'd been to the platform before
and cased it.

11:05.205 --> 11:08.573
Psychopaths can't premeditate?
No, of course they can.

11:08.575 --> 11:11.409
But tube pushers
tend to be lunatics

11:11.411 --> 11:13.261
of the raving variety.

11:13.263 --> 11:14.346
They're sloppy.

11:14.348 --> 11:16.765
This man was the opposite.

11:16.767 --> 11:19.384
Good news is...

11:21.304 --> 11:24.255
...I know exactly
what he looks like.

11:24.257 --> 11:25.774
Look, I can't tell

11:25.776 --> 11:27.776
if you're kidding
right now or not.

11:27.778 --> 11:29.260
I reached out

11:29.262 --> 11:30.595
to the witnesses
who helped generate

11:30.597 --> 11:31.780
that sketch--
completely useless,

11:31.782 --> 11:33.431
especially with regards
to the patch

11:33.433 --> 11:36.201
he has on his jacket here--
looks like some sort of logo.

11:36.203 --> 11:37.619
I can't tell
what it is.

11:37.621 --> 11:39.237
You think you can find
the guy from a patch?

11:39.239 --> 11:41.573
Stranger
things, Watson.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.107
How goes the search

11:43.109 --> 11:44.826
for father's lawyer's
assistant's sister?

11:44.828 --> 11:47.212
Well...
I went through

11:47.214 --> 11:48.246
everything that
the firm's investigators

11:48.248 --> 11:49.714
have put together,
and so far, nothing.

11:49.716 --> 11:51.583
I mean, if she's really
hiding from her husband,

11:51.585 --> 11:53.168
she's doing a bang-up job.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.620
I can see why the police
called off the search.

11:55.622 --> 11:57.012
Have you spoken
to the husband yet?

11:57.037 --> 11:58.057
No, I called

11:58.058 --> 12:00.058
his art gallery today,
and he's out of town.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.978
I'm gonna pop in tomorrow and do
my best Columbo impression.

12:03.996 --> 12:05.296
He was a...

12:06.149 --> 12:07.933
Never mind.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.467
I'm excited for you.

12:09.469 --> 12:11.403
When you talk to him,
you'll identify yourself

12:11.405 --> 12:13.405
as a "consulting detective."

12:13.407 --> 12:15.240
You haven't done that before.
I...

12:18.811 --> 12:20.812
Oh, no.

12:20.814 --> 12:22.781
Carver and Sons.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.850
8:00, I was
supposed to meet you.

12:24.852 --> 12:27.869
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say you forgot.

12:27.871 --> 12:29.504
It's okay. It's not like
Look, Em, I...

12:29.506 --> 12:32.073
you forgot to meet me
the last time we made plans.

12:32.075 --> 12:34.309
Oh, no, wait, you did.

12:34.311 --> 12:37.229
Let me make it up to you--
uh, tomorrow, my treat.

12:37.231 --> 12:40.415
I don't know, Joan.
Come on. I feel awful.

12:41.652 --> 12:43.268
Know what? Yeah.

12:43.270 --> 12:45.570
Tomorrow should work.
I'll see you at 8:00.

12:45.572 --> 12:47.672
Okay, great.
I'll see you then.

12:52.361 --> 12:54.696
Mr. Gardner?
Hi. I'm Joan Watson.

12:54.698 --> 12:56.064
I'm consulting, uh...

12:56.066 --> 12:58.233
I-I'm assisting
with an investigation

12:58.235 --> 13:00.485
into the disappearance
of your wife.

13:00.487 --> 13:02.988
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions?

13:02.990 --> 13:05.574
Of course. Come in.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.036
I thought Callie leaving

13:08.061 --> 13:09.712
me was the worst thing
that could ever happen.

13:09.713 --> 13:12.080
I was wrong-- the
worst part was...

13:12.082 --> 13:14.198
realizing Rebecca
thought I'd hurt her.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.418
Do you think it's strange
that Callie hasn't tried

13:16.420 --> 13:18.553
to contact you or Rebecca
since she left?

13:19.555 --> 13:21.539
Yeah.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.207
I guess I do.

13:23.209 --> 13:26.061
But... do I find it stranger
than her packing her things

13:26.063 --> 13:27.879
and sending me a
Dear John letter

13:27.881 --> 13:30.181
in the form of a video? No.

13:30.183 --> 13:32.216
She's always
been a very...

13:32.218 --> 13:34.218
complicated person.

13:34.220 --> 13:37.072
Rebecca mentioned that
Callie left you once before?

13:37.074 --> 13:39.057
About a year and half ago.

13:39.059 --> 13:41.860
It was just for a couple
of days, but still...

13:41.862 --> 13:43.411
it was devastating.

13:43.413 --> 13:45.697
That time she
called me.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.866
I begged her to come home.
I told her

13:47.868 --> 13:50.085
whatever was bothering her,
we could work it out.

13:50.087 --> 13:53.371
I guess I got through to her,
because... she came back.

13:53.373 --> 13:54.623
If you don't mind me asking,

13:54.625 --> 13:56.007
what <i>were</i> the problems
between you?

13:56.009 --> 13:57.208
I don't know.

13:57.210 --> 13:58.877
The first time she left,
it was like

13:58.879 --> 14:00.545
being hit over the head
with a club.

14:00.547 --> 14:02.013
I thought things
were good between us.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.266
I thought we were
in a good place.

14:04.268 --> 14:06.935
Obviously, I was... wrong.

14:06.937 --> 14:08.419
And what about
the second time?

14:08.421 --> 14:10.805
She seemed a little
distant of late.

14:10.807 --> 14:13.024
A little depressed.
Do you know why?

14:13.026 --> 14:14.609
Something to do
with that woman

14:14.611 --> 14:17.028
who got pushed in front
of the subway car.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.197
The one she talked
about in the video.

14:19.199 --> 14:21.866
Rebecca also mentioned
something about a trunk that

14:21.868 --> 14:23.568
went missing.
It didn't go missing; Callie took it.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.603
I don't know how many times
Rebecca has to hear it

14:25.605 --> 14:27.539
until she believes it.

14:27.541 --> 14:30.458
I just wish I could make her
understand that I want Callie back, too.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.961
Not because I think our
marriage can be saved--

14:32.963 --> 14:34.913
I know that...
ship has sailed--

14:34.915 --> 14:37.382
but... because I'm
worried about her.

14:37.384 --> 14:40.385
I want to tell her
that it's okay,

14:40.387 --> 14:42.337
that I want her to be happy.

14:42.339 --> 14:46.925
Even if being happy means...
being with somebody else.

14:48.895 --> 14:51.680
Watson?
Remember how you said yesterday

14:51.682 --> 14:54.316
you thought Callie Burrell
was probably okay?

14:54.318 --> 14:57.152
I do.
I'm pretty sure that's not right.

14:57.154 --> 15:00.355
I'm pretty sure
her husband killed her.

15:07.986 --> 15:09.487
...but because
I'm worried about her.

15:09.489 --> 15:11.506
I want to tell that
it's okay,

15:11.508 --> 15:13.458
that I want her to be happy.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.993
Even if being happy means...

15:15.995 --> 15:17.962
being with somebody else.

15:17.964 --> 15:20.165
That was recorded
by the police the first time

15:20.167 --> 15:21.933
they interviewed
Drew Gardner five months ago.

15:21.935 --> 15:24.519
He said the same exact
thing to me this morning.

15:24.521 --> 15:25.705
Verbatim.

15:25.730 --> 15:26.656
And because he
repeated himself,

15:26.657 --> 15:28.506
you think he's
a murderer.

15:28.508 --> 15:30.475
No, it's not because
he repeated himself,

15:30.477 --> 15:32.427
it's just that what he said
sounded rehearsed-- like...

15:32.429 --> 15:35.346
like he came up with his story
and then stuck with it.

15:35.348 --> 15:37.527
Perhaps it's lodged
in his brain because he's

15:37.552 --> 15:38.350
had to repeat it so often.

15:38.351 --> 15:40.268
To his sister-in-law,
to the police,

15:40.270 --> 15:42.153
to his friends,
to his colleagues, to you.

15:42.155 --> 15:44.522
I'm not poking holes;
you may very well be right.

15:44.524 --> 15:47.191
I just want to be certain that
you've thought this through.

15:47.193 --> 15:48.743
There's just something
about this guy,

15:48.745 --> 15:50.328
something I didn't like.

15:50.330 --> 15:52.830
Let's say your assessment
of the man is correct.

15:52.832 --> 15:55.700
He is a cad and a killer--
that would mean the stakes

15:55.702 --> 15:57.418
of this investigation
have just been raised.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.203
Would you like me to tag in?

15:59.205 --> 16:00.872
No.

16:00.874 --> 16:02.740
No, not yet.

16:09.682 --> 16:12.550
If you <i>were</i>
working this case,

16:12.552 --> 16:15.252
what would your next step be?

16:16.555 --> 16:19.941
Do you have
Mr. Gardner's cell number handy?

16:20.809 --> 16:22.426
Gaslighting.

16:22.428 --> 16:24.729
A form of psychological abuse

16:24.731 --> 16:26.981
in which false information
is presented

16:26.983 --> 16:30.285
with the intention
of disorienting a victim...

16:30.287 --> 16:34.271
and/or steering them
on a certain course of action.

16:34.273 --> 16:38.409
The name derives from
the 1938 stage play <i>Gaslight,</i>

16:38.411 --> 16:39.777
also known as

16:39.779 --> 16:41.913
<i>Angel Street.</i>
Why do you have

16:41.915 --> 16:43.965
so many phones?
Well, why do you have only one?

16:43.967 --> 16:46.117
These are burners.

16:46.119 --> 16:49.554
They are utterly discardable,
virtually untraceable.

16:49.556 --> 16:52.140
Uh, what are you doing?

16:52.142 --> 16:54.458
I know...

16:54.460 --> 16:56.961
that you killed her.

16:56.963 --> 16:59.013
I know...

16:59.015 --> 17:01.232
what you did with her body.

17:03.053 --> 17:07.137
Mr. Gardner's gas
has just been lit.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.656
Now it's just a question
of surveilling him,

17:08.657 --> 17:10.074
observing where he goes,
what he does.

17:10.076 --> 17:11.608
You'll need to rent
a car for that.

17:11.611 --> 17:13.161
If Gardner is a murderer,

17:13.163 --> 17:15.279
our message may
throw him off his game.

17:15.281 --> 17:17.781
He may reveal something to you
which he otherwise would have not.

17:17.784 --> 17:19.117
Where are you going?

17:19.118 --> 17:21.202
Police station to
question a suspect.

17:21.204 --> 17:24.821
You're not the only one who's made
progress on their investigation.

17:26.992 --> 17:28.926
Yeah, I recognize her.

17:28.928 --> 17:30.995
She was in the news
a few months ago.

17:30.997 --> 17:33.297
She got pushed in front
of a train or something.

17:33.299 --> 17:35.299
Yeah.

17:37.019 --> 17:39.336
But that's not...

17:39.338 --> 17:42.857
how <i>you</i> know her, though,
is it, Mr. Samuels?

17:42.859 --> 17:44.508
I mean, you...

17:44.510 --> 17:46.944
you worked in the same
office building together.

17:46.946 --> 17:48.479
Before she died.

17:48.481 --> 17:52.066
She was a secretary;
you were a custodial engineer.

17:52.068 --> 17:54.402
That's right.

17:54.404 --> 17:57.538
We used to see each other
around the building sometimes.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.207
Yeah. Yeah.

17:59.209 --> 18:01.709
Do you remember seeing her
around the subway platform?

18:03.078 --> 18:05.663
I arrived at a theory
last night.

18:05.665 --> 18:07.465
The man who killed Ms. Tully,

18:07.467 --> 18:09.667
he'd been
on that platform before.

18:09.669 --> 18:11.219
He'd studied it.

18:11.221 --> 18:13.921
He knew where
the security cameras were. Hm?

18:13.923 --> 18:17.725
So I began to look at footage
from the days and weeks

18:17.727 --> 18:20.011
preceding her murder.

18:20.013 --> 18:22.647
You'll never guess who
I saw following her...

18:22.649 --> 18:25.549
on more than one occasion.

18:29.271 --> 18:32.223
Now, this was recorded

18:32.225 --> 18:35.243
ten days before her murder.

18:35.245 --> 18:37.528
There's Ms. Tully.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.235
There's you.

18:44.237 --> 18:45.728
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

18:45.753 --> 18:47.706
that's a cell phone
that you're carrying?

18:47.707 --> 18:49.424
You're being discreet,

18:49.426 --> 18:52.743
but you are recording her.

18:52.745 --> 18:55.379
You have a record,
Mr. Samuels?

18:56.532 --> 18:59.517
You were arrested
on a stalking charge

18:59.519 --> 19:01.436
in Florida in 2009.

19:01.438 --> 19:03.271
That was a misunderstanding.

19:03.273 --> 19:06.057
Was this a misunderstanding, too?
What are you,

19:06.059 --> 19:07.892
six feet, about 185?

19:07.894 --> 19:10.194
So was this guy.

19:10.196 --> 19:12.113
Put a fake beard on you,
some sunglasses,

19:12.115 --> 19:13.815
be hard to tell
the difference.

19:13.817 --> 19:14.774
What do you think?

19:14.799 --> 19:16.374
I think you make
an excellent point.

19:16.936 --> 19:18.435
I would never have hurt Vivian.

19:18.437 --> 19:19.954
Course you wouldn't.
Nor would you have

19:19.956 --> 19:21.789
stalked her,
nor would you record images

19:21.791 --> 19:23.941
of her on your phone.

19:24.793 --> 19:27.111
All right, fine.

19:27.113 --> 19:29.613
You're right,
I was there that night.

19:29.615 --> 19:31.782
And I was in disguise.

19:31.784 --> 19:33.718
But I didn't kill her.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.419
I thought
she'd seen me

19:35.421 --> 19:37.755
following her
a few nights before.

19:37.757 --> 19:40.224
<i>So I started wearing a hat</i>
<i>and a scarf</i>

19:40.226 --> 19:42.626
that covered my mouth.

19:42.628 --> 19:44.562
I'm there.

19:44.564 --> 19:47.265
I just,
I'm not in frame.

19:47.267 --> 19:49.317
Well, that's convenient.

19:49.319 --> 19:51.068
You don't get it.
I was recording her

19:51.070 --> 19:52.987
that night, too.
I can prove that

19:52.989 --> 19:54.822
I wasn't the one
that pushed her.

19:58.777 --> 20:00.661
Oh, my God, no!

20:00.663 --> 20:03.598
So, what do you think?

20:03.600 --> 20:06.284
It's Anson Samuels' voice,
that much is certain.

20:06.286 --> 20:09.504
The question is, has the video been
manipulated in some way.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.789
If it hasn't,
did Samuels orchestrate

20:11.791 --> 20:13.090
the pushing.

20:13.092 --> 20:15.176
Did he hire an equally
mad associate

20:15.178 --> 20:17.261
to murder the object
of his obsession

20:17.263 --> 20:19.680
so that he could record
it for posterity?

20:19.682 --> 20:21.599
Well, we're holding on to him
either way, but eventually,

20:21.601 --> 20:23.500
we're gonna have to charge him
or cut him loose.

20:23.502 --> 20:25.770
I was hoping that this new angle
would shed some light

20:25.772 --> 20:27.271
on the identity
of the pusher, but...

20:27.273 --> 20:28.806
as luck would have it,

20:28.808 --> 20:31.192
his face isn't seen
by this camera, either.

20:31.194 --> 20:33.561
Nor was the patch
on his jacket.

20:33.563 --> 20:35.646
Patch?

20:38.317 --> 20:40.201
Excuse me.

20:41.620 --> 20:44.322
Watson. Still surveilling?

20:44.324 --> 20:46.791
If by "surveilling,"
you mean sitting on my butt

20:46.793 --> 20:50.378
watching a man do absolutely
nothing out of the ordinary,

20:50.380 --> 20:52.046
it's going great.

20:52.048 --> 20:53.998
The text I sent had no effect.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.500
Drew Gardner has not left
the gallery all day.

20:56.502 --> 20:57.919
Well, patience, Watson.

20:57.921 --> 21:00.087
There is <i>no</i> branch
of detective work

21:00.089 --> 21:02.340
which is as important
nor as neglected

21:02.342 --> 21:04.559
as the art of tracing footsteps.

21:04.561 --> 21:07.478
It's okay, I've still got
a few good hours left.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.480
Actually... you're not--
at least you're not good

21:09.482 --> 21:12.549
between the hours of 8:00
and approximately 10:00 p.m.

21:12.551 --> 21:14.088
What are you talking about?

21:14.113 --> 21:17.342
I overheard you making plans
with a friend last night. Em.

21:17.390 --> 21:19.407
Short for "Emily,"
if my memory serves.

21:19.409 --> 21:21.859
Oh, no, I can't believe
I forgot again.

21:21.861 --> 21:24.662
Well, I did not,
so I reached out to Alfredo

21:24.664 --> 21:27.615
earlier on, and he is
standing by to relieve you.

21:27.617 --> 21:28.899
Are you serious?

21:28.901 --> 21:30.751
Thank you.

21:39.628 --> 21:41.012
The busker.

21:41.014 --> 21:42.046
Excuse me?

21:42.048 --> 21:44.181
The busker.
The fiddler.

21:44.183 --> 21:46.384
He's playing Paganini's,
uh, <i>24 Caprices,</i>

21:46.386 --> 21:49.103
<i>Opus 1, Number 11.</i>

21:49.105 --> 21:51.639
Rewind it.

21:52.524 --> 21:53.774
There.

21:53.776 --> 21:55.343
I don't hear anything

21:55.345 --> 21:57.278
over the subway.
Yeah, neither do I.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.897
Then how can you tell he's
playing Paganini's whatever?

21:59.899 --> 22:02.733
I can see it-- I know
the piece from... the bowing,

22:02.735 --> 22:05.036
fingering,
double-stop trills.

22:05.038 --> 22:07.038
You don't know
I play the violin?

22:07.040 --> 22:09.240
Before today I didn't
even know you ate food.

22:09.242 --> 22:10.908
I don't get it
. does it matter

22:10.910 --> 22:12.710
what song the guy's playing?

22:12.712 --> 22:15.379
Oh, it doesn't. What matters is,
he stops in the middle.

22:15.381 --> 22:17.614
Watch.

22:17.616 --> 22:19.200
He stops halfway
through the andante,

22:19.202 --> 22:20.735
doesn't even touch the presto.

22:20.737 --> 22:22.270
why?

22:22.272 --> 22:25.139
Why does he stop so suddenly
and leave the platform?

22:25.141 --> 22:27.558
The answer is...

22:27.560 --> 22:31.312
he sees our pusher.

22:32.964 --> 22:37.418
He knows him.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.770
He might even have known
what he was about to do.

22:39.772 --> 22:46.143
We find our busker...
we find the pusher.

22:46.145 --> 22:47.778
Hey.

22:47.780 --> 22:50.414
Hey, I didn't know you guys
were gonna be here, too.

22:50.416 --> 22:52.750
It was sort of a last second thing.
Hey.

22:52.752 --> 22:54.818
How is everything?
What's going on?

22:54.820 --> 22:58.005
There's a reason why I asked
Hope and Ken to join us.

22:58.007 --> 22:59.707
Uh, can I get a beer?

22:59.709 --> 23:02.215
Uh, your mother called me
the other day.

23:02.240 --> 23:02.827
Yeah?

23:02.828 --> 23:04.679
We got to talking.
Thanks.

23:04.681 --> 23:06.964
I told her how you and I
kept missing each other.

23:06.966 --> 23:09.800
She said you're working
as some sort of detective now.

23:09.802 --> 23:13.670
And she's
so proud of you, excited.

23:13.672 --> 23:16.474
But when I heard, I just...

23:18.060 --> 23:19.810
What?

23:19.812 --> 23:21.946
I don't know. I...

23:21.948 --> 23:24.615
Well, in a way, on the one hand,
it explained a lot.

23:24.617 --> 23:26.734
You know, the way
you've fallen out of touch

23:26.736 --> 23:28.202
these last few months?

23:28.204 --> 23:30.871
How you've made and broken
so many plans with me.

23:30.873 --> 23:32.540
With Hope and Ken.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.125
With others.

23:34.127 --> 23:36.711
We were worried about you, Joan.
I guess we still are.

23:40.299 --> 23:43.501
Is this is an intervention?

23:43.503 --> 23:45.136
Wow. No, it's not.

23:45.138 --> 23:47.704
It's just a few friends
expressing concern

23:47.706 --> 23:49.507
for another.

23:49.509 --> 23:51.092
That's an intervention.
Trust me.

23:51.094 --> 23:53.477
I have helped organize
plenty of them.

23:53.479 --> 23:55.846
Back when you were still
a sober companion, right?

23:55.848 --> 23:57.515
After you were a surgeon,

23:57.517 --> 23:59.383
but before you decided
to become a private eye?

23:59.385 --> 24:03.053
I'm sorry,
but you seem lost.

24:03.055 --> 24:06.723
You have ever since
you stopped practicing medicine.

24:06.725 --> 24:11.228
We know that your new mentor
is your last sober client.

24:11.230 --> 24:12.580
And...?

24:12.582 --> 24:15.065
"And...?"

24:15.067 --> 24:18.669
Joan, you quit your job
and moved out of your apartment

24:18.671 --> 24:21.539
so you could live full-time
with a recovering drug addict

24:21.541 --> 24:24.542
who's going to teach you how
to be some sort of gumshoe?

24:24.544 --> 24:26.510
Are you involved with him?

24:26.512 --> 24:29.130
Because that would
explain a lot.

24:30.182 --> 24:32.583
You know what?

24:32.585 --> 24:35.019
I am gonna see you guys later.

24:35.021 --> 24:36.887
What? Joan!

24:36.889 --> 24:38.439
I didn't think that I would have

24:38.441 --> 24:40.757
to explain my life to you, Emily.
Come on.

24:40.759 --> 24:43.444
I mean, what would you say to me
if I told you

24:43.446 --> 24:45.095
I was quitting
journalism to become a...

24:45.097 --> 24:46.480
I don't know-- a windsurfer?

24:46.482 --> 24:48.399
Or if Hope told you

24:48.401 --> 24:50.618
she was giving up teaching
to join the Marines.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.903
Would you really just
congratulate us?

24:52.905 --> 24:56.290
Or would you pull us aside and
make sure everything was okay?

24:56.292 --> 24:58.793
So, do you think what I do
is like windsurfing?

24:58.795 --> 24:59.960
I don't know what it's like.

24:59.962 --> 25:01.212
I just know you.

25:01.214 --> 25:04.298
And I know
you're not a detective.

25:17.896 --> 25:19.396
One of those
self-storage places.

25:19.398 --> 25:22.483
The guy you wanted me to watch
talked to the manager,

25:22.485 --> 25:24.468
walked in that
unit right there.

25:30.075 --> 25:33.327
That trunk.

25:33.329 --> 25:35.746
<i>It belonged</i>
<i>to his sister-in-law.</i>

25:35.748 --> 25:37.814
<i>She thought he might he</i>
<i>used it to get rid of his wife.</i>

25:37.816 --> 25:39.850
Hold up. Are you trying to tell
me there's a person in there?

25:39.852 --> 25:41.652
Sherlock sent him
an anonymous text this morning,

25:41.654 --> 25:45.155
said he knew where the body was.

25:57.886 --> 26:00.337
We need to call the cops.
No, no, not yet.

26:00.339 --> 26:01.722
What do you mean "not yet".
I want to do this myself.

26:01.724 --> 26:03.173
Do you still have that slim Jim?
Yeah.

26:03.175 --> 26:05.309
Look, I didn't hear
a alarm trip on,

26:05.311 --> 26:07.645
so all I have to do is get past
that door lock.

26:07.647 --> 26:08.779
Joan...
What?

26:08.781 --> 26:09.763
You don't think
I can do this?

26:09.765 --> 26:10.948
Oh, I know you can do this,

26:10.950 --> 26:12.366
'cause after
everything I taught,

26:12.368 --> 26:14.128
you could jack that car
in your sleep-- Joan!

26:46.551 --> 26:48.903
Hey!

26:48.905 --> 26:50.437
That's enough, ma'am.

26:50.439 --> 26:51.939
Step away from
the car, please.

26:51.941 --> 26:53.524
Hey, is there a problem?

26:53.526 --> 26:55.559
Is this your vehicle, sir?
Yeah.

26:55.561 --> 26:57.945
I'm the guard here.
I saw this woman

26:57.947 --> 27:00.164
breaking into your car
in one of my monitors.

27:00.166 --> 27:02.899
You-- You're the one who came to
ask me questions about Callie.

27:02.901 --> 27:04.568
I'm investigating this man.

27:04.570 --> 27:06.954
I have reason to believe
that he murdered his wife

27:06.956 --> 27:08.622
and hid her body in this trunk.

27:08.624 --> 27:10.174
What?! That's a lie.

27:10.176 --> 27:11.425
There's an easy way
to see if I'm right.

27:11.427 --> 27:12.876
Just ask him to open it.

27:12.878 --> 27:14.578
Excuse me? I don't have
to open a damn thing.

27:14.580 --> 27:15.930
His name is Drew Gardner.

27:15.932 --> 27:17.765
You can look it up on
your phone.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.850
There are articles on
the disappearance of his wife.

27:19.852 --> 27:22.136
She went missing six months ago,
same time as this trunk.

27:22.138 --> 27:24.921
Would you open up
this trunk, please?

27:24.923 --> 27:26.757
Are you kidding me?!

27:26.759 --> 27:29.360
If she's wrong, you ain't
got nothing to hide.

27:29.362 --> 27:31.695
You can either open
up that trunk for me,

27:31.697 --> 27:33.447
or open it up
for them.

27:46.411 --> 27:49.780
Happy now?

28:12.881 --> 28:15.583
I have the very strongest
sensation of déjà vu.

28:17.336 --> 28:19.754
I paid your bail.

28:19.756 --> 28:21.472
Paperwork's being processed.

28:21.474 --> 28:25.793
You'll be released back
into society shortly.

28:25.795 --> 28:28.146
Thank you.

28:28.148 --> 28:30.297
I spoke with Alfredo
before I came here.

28:30.299 --> 28:32.350
He told me what
transpired tonight.

28:32.352 --> 28:34.802
You took a chance. Yeah?

28:34.804 --> 28:36.804
Fortune often favors the bold.

28:36.806 --> 28:38.523
But not tonight.
Mm.

28:38.525 --> 28:40.608
You were right.

28:41.743 --> 28:43.477
The trunk was the same one

28:43.479 --> 28:45.947
that Rebecca Burrell mentioned
to us the other day.

28:45.949 --> 28:47.782
If Drew Gardner
wasn't using that

28:47.784 --> 28:49.584
to get rid of his wife's body,
what was he doing with it?

28:49.586 --> 28:52.370
Well, I didn't speak
to the man himself,

28:52.372 --> 28:54.589
but I did speak to the officers
who arrested you.

28:54.591 --> 28:57.324
According to the statement
that he gave them,

28:57.326 --> 28:59.159
he sold the trunk

28:59.161 --> 29:02.046
shortly after he received
the video from his wife.

29:02.048 --> 29:03.631
Partly out of spite,

29:03.633 --> 29:05.850
partly because
his gallery was struggling.

29:05.852 --> 29:07.885
He knew it was worth
several thousand dollars.

29:07.887 --> 29:09.887
Sold it to a client.

29:09.889 --> 29:12.190
He could have told Rebecca
that months ago.

29:12.192 --> 29:14.058
Mm. Well, he was afraid.

29:14.060 --> 29:15.693
He knew
what he'd done was wrong.

29:15.695 --> 29:17.728
The trunk was not his to sell.

29:17.730 --> 29:20.948
Apparently, your visit yesterday
inspired him

29:20.950 --> 29:22.617
to come clean.

29:22.619 --> 29:24.569
The idea that
Rebecca thought

29:24.571 --> 29:27.071
he'd used the trunk
to dispose of Callie

29:27.073 --> 29:29.290
was more troubling
to him than the idea

29:29.292 --> 29:32.026
of being punished for
his actual transgression.

29:32.028 --> 29:34.245
So he reached out
to the guy he sold it to

29:34.247 --> 29:35.863
and made an offer
to buy it back.

29:35.865 --> 29:37.915
The storage space
that he accessed tonight

29:37.917 --> 29:39.750
was the collector's, not his.

29:39.752 --> 29:42.570
He was merely
picking up the trunk

29:42.572 --> 29:44.338
so he could return
it to Rebecca.

29:44.340 --> 29:46.007
Apparently,
there is a paper trail

29:46.009 --> 29:49.043
which confirms
this series of events.

29:49.045 --> 29:51.545
I was so sure
she was in that trunk.

29:51.547 --> 29:55.766
Given the many givens,
your hypothesis was good.

29:55.768 --> 29:57.935
But I was wrong.

29:57.937 --> 29:59.553
You were wrong about a trunk.

29:59.555 --> 30:01.572
That does not mean
that you were wrong

30:01.574 --> 30:02.940
about the man being a murderer.

30:02.942 --> 30:05.610
I just keep thinking

30:05.612 --> 30:08.496
that if you were the one
to break into that car,

30:08.498 --> 30:10.564
she would have been there.

30:10.566 --> 30:12.783
But because it was me...

30:12.785 --> 30:16.070
I have another errand to run
before tonight is through.

30:16.072 --> 30:17.588
In the morning,

30:17.590 --> 30:20.758
I propose that we begin
working both cases together.

30:20.760 --> 30:23.744
After you've helped me
find my subway pusher,

30:23.746 --> 30:27.682
perhaps I can help you find
Callie Burrell.

30:35.774 --> 30:38.526
Bach? Why, Thaddeus,
you've gone commercial.

30:38.528 --> 30:39.860
How do you know my name?

30:39.862 --> 30:41.228
Your many citations

30:41.230 --> 30:43.263
for performing
on subway platforms.

30:43.265 --> 30:44.949
I'm assuming
those are the reasons

30:44.951 --> 30:46.701
you're now performing
above ground.

30:46.703 --> 30:48.452
Oh, you're the cops.

30:48.454 --> 30:51.072
No, no, he is.
I'm a concerned citizen.

30:51.074 --> 30:53.491
Name Vivian Tully
mean anything to you?

30:53.493 --> 30:54.709
No.

30:54.711 --> 30:56.911
Well, maybe her
picture will.

31:01.616 --> 31:03.334
- No.
- You were there the night

31:03.336 --> 31:05.219
a madman pushed her in
front of a subway train.

31:05.221 --> 31:06.637
There's no use
in denying it.

31:06.639 --> 31:08.806
We've got you on video.

31:08.808 --> 31:10.975
Yeah, okay, I was there.

31:10.977 --> 31:13.293
But I only heard about
what happened on the news.

31:13.295 --> 31:15.062
I wasn't there
when it actually went down.

31:15.064 --> 31:17.648
Of course you were, 'cause
the minute you saw the pusher,

31:17.650 --> 31:19.567
you picked up your stuff,
and you left.

31:19.569 --> 31:22.019
Why? 'Cause you know him.
I'd like to know how.

31:22.021 --> 31:24.471
Sorry, man, I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:24.473 --> 31:25.906
You do know what
I'm talking about,

31:25.908 --> 31:27.241
and the sooner you
tell me the connection,

31:27.243 --> 31:28.859
the less likely
I'll be to tell

31:28.861 --> 31:30.745
Detective Bell here that
you're also a pickpocket.

31:30.747 --> 31:31.996
<i>I was studying you</i>
<i>from across the street.</i>

31:31.998 --> 31:33.664
<i>You're actually very good.</i>

31:33.666 --> 31:37.168
<i>Fiddling must keep</i>
<i>those fingers nimble, hmm?</i>

31:37.170 --> 31:40.838
Detective, would you give us
a moment, please?

31:44.876 --> 31:47.345
Look, I didn't know
the guy, okay?

31:47.347 --> 31:48.829
I just knew his face.

31:48.831 --> 31:50.931
I'd seen him on the platform
a few nights before,

31:50.933 --> 31:53.050
tried to lift his wallet,
he caught me.

31:53.052 --> 31:55.720
Grabbed my wrist, I panicked,
hauled off and punched him.

31:55.722 --> 31:57.054
He fell, I took off.

31:57.056 --> 31:59.390
When I saw him the night
he killed the girl,

31:59.392 --> 32:01.341
I was just worried
he might recognize me

32:01.343 --> 32:03.394
and call the transit cops,
so I left.

32:06.281 --> 32:08.649
You're checking out my
coat right now, aren't you?

32:08.651 --> 32:10.534
Thinking of where you
can infiltrate it.

32:10.536 --> 32:12.203
Sorry, okay?
It's a force of habit.

32:12.205 --> 32:13.871
Ah, of course.

32:13.873 --> 32:15.990
I mean, a coat to a
picker of pockets

32:15.992 --> 32:18.192
is like a vault to a
safecracker, isn't it?

32:18.194 --> 32:19.543
You've got to study it,

32:19.545 --> 32:21.545
find a way in without
being detected.

32:21.547 --> 32:24.331
So... the pusher.

32:24.333 --> 32:28.669
He had a patch on his
jacket right here.

32:28.671 --> 32:31.555
Perhaps you'd be able
to tell me what it was.

32:33.759 --> 32:38.062
If you feel like
you have to, don't.

32:38.064 --> 32:39.713
So your busker was able

32:39.715 --> 32:42.316
to pick out this patch
from an image search. Now what?

32:42.318 --> 32:44.235
We bring it
to the public's attention,

32:44.237 --> 32:46.053
see if it,
in conjunction with the sketch,

32:46.055 --> 32:47.054
shakes anything loose.

32:50.275 --> 32:52.059
I thought you both should know:

32:52.061 --> 32:55.913
I invited Drew Gardner to
the station a little while ago.

32:57.032 --> 32:59.033
If you apologize,

32:59.035 --> 33:00.951
promise to pay for the damage

33:00.953 --> 33:02.569
you did to his car,

33:02.571 --> 33:05.339
and refrain
from any further harassment,

33:05.341 --> 33:08.209
he'll drop the charges
against you.

33:08.211 --> 33:10.127
I wouldn't accept Mr. Gardner's
terms under any circumstances.

33:10.129 --> 33:12.579
Yeah, well, she's not you.

33:12.581 --> 33:13.931
Miss Watson's instincts
have been telling her

33:13.933 --> 33:15.349
that the man is a murderer.

33:15.351 --> 33:18.418
He's right. I'm not like you.
I'm not like you.

33:18.420 --> 33:20.521
I...

33:20.523 --> 33:22.606
I've never had a record before.

33:24.425 --> 33:25.976
Well...

33:25.978 --> 33:28.312
Me and Mr. Gardner

33:28.314 --> 33:30.531
will be in my office.

33:31.983 --> 33:33.767
Think about what you're saying.

33:33.769 --> 33:35.035
I am. I have.

33:35.037 --> 33:36.370
Last night was a wake-up call.

33:36.372 --> 33:37.404
You made a mistake.

33:37.406 --> 33:38.456
No, it wasn't just what happened

33:38.458 --> 33:39.907
at the storage facility.

33:39.909 --> 33:41.625
My friends found out
what I've been doing.

33:41.627 --> 33:42.993
I didn't realize you'd been
keeping it a secret.

33:42.995 --> 33:44.044
They don't get it.

33:44.046 --> 33:45.496
Opinions are like anine, Watson.

33:45.498 --> 33:46.797
Everyone has one.

33:46.799 --> 33:47.998
You know what, maybe what you do

33:48.000 --> 33:49.467
is not something
that you can teach.

33:49.469 --> 33:50.634
Maybe it's something

33:50.636 --> 33:52.336
that just has
to come naturally.

33:52.338 --> 33:54.672
I-I just... I have a lot to
think about, that's all.

34:13.641 --> 34:15.025
Ms. Burrell? Joan Watson.

34:15.027 --> 34:16.659
We met the other day.

34:16.661 --> 34:18.027
Please.

34:18.030 --> 34:19.313
Have a seat.

34:19.315 --> 34:20.498
Thank you.

34:20.500 --> 34:21.831
Did you want to ask me

34:21.833 --> 34:23.333
more questions
about Callie?

34:23.335 --> 34:26.820
Actually, I came
to apologize.

34:26.822 --> 34:28.606
I got a little too aggressive

34:28.608 --> 34:31.625
with the investigation
last night, and...

34:31.627 --> 34:34.494
I'm afraid that Mr. Holmes
and I will not be able

34:34.496 --> 34:36.679
to remain on the case.

34:48.193 --> 34:49.944
Ms. Watson?

34:49.946 --> 34:51.728
Callie's jacket-- that patch.

34:51.731 --> 34:54.532
You mean Drew's jacket.

34:54.534 --> 34:55.733
It was cold that day.

34:55.735 --> 34:56.984
He let her wear it.

34:56.985 --> 34:59.019
She called it
his "hippie coat.

34:59.021 --> 35:01.521
He got it at a concert
in college or something.

35:01.523 --> 35:03.190
This is gonna sound strange,

35:03.192 --> 35:05.376
but has Drew ever had a beard?

35:05.378 --> 35:07.494
Yeah, for a while.

35:07.496 --> 35:09.330
He shaved it off
around the same time

35:09.332 --> 35:10.965
that Callie disappeared.

35:10.967 --> 35:14.001
Why?

35:22.667 --> 35:25.202
Let's start with what
we know, shall we?

35:25.204 --> 35:26.670
Vivian Tully was murdered

35:26.672 --> 35:29.506
six months ago
by a bearded individual.

35:29.508 --> 35:31.909
We know that
Drew Gardner wore a beard

35:31.911 --> 35:33.277
at approximately
that time.

35:33.279 --> 35:35.078
He also owned a jacket

35:35.080 --> 35:37.915
identical to the one
worn by the killer.

35:37.917 --> 35:39.349
Several days later,

35:39.351 --> 35:41.268
Callie Burrell
records a video

35:41.270 --> 35:43.554
in which she says
the murder has affected her,

35:43.556 --> 35:45.255
it's made her think.

35:45.257 --> 35:47.224
She leaves Drew.

35:47.226 --> 35:49.693
Thanks to you, we now have
reason to believe

35:49.695 --> 35:51.645
that Drew Gardner
was the man

35:51.647 --> 35:52.896
that pushed Vivian Tully

35:52.898 --> 35:54.781
in front of
the subway train.

35:54.783 --> 35:57.234
Question is, why?

35:57.236 --> 35:59.653
What are the odds that it would

35:59.655 --> 36:03.373
affect his wife so much
that she leaves him?

36:03.375 --> 36:05.375
Is it possible that's
what he was counting on?

36:05.377 --> 36:07.294
If he was, what kind
of plan is that?

36:07.296 --> 36:09.946
I mean, how could he know
that killing Vivian Tully

36:09.948 --> 36:12.115
would affect Callie
the way that it did?

36:12.117 --> 36:14.218
I don't know.

36:14.220 --> 36:16.003
Maybe I'm wrong
about this, too.

36:16.005 --> 36:17.254
Maybe it's just
a coincidence

36:17.256 --> 36:18.622
that he has that
jacket with a patch.

36:18.624 --> 36:19.789
Have I... have I told you

36:19.791 --> 36:20.790
how distracting
I find self-doubt?

36:20.792 --> 36:22.142
If you must wallow,

36:22.144 --> 36:24.011
I ask that you do it
in the privacy of your room.

36:24.013 --> 36:25.429
Do I need to remind you
that I made

36:25.431 --> 36:27.097
a mistake last night
that got me arrested?

36:27.099 --> 36:28.065
Do I need to remind you

36:28.067 --> 36:29.066
that you made
a discovery today

36:29.068 --> 36:30.634
that may ultimately
solve both cases?

36:30.636 --> 36:33.570
Do you wish to mourn the former
or celebrate the latter?

36:33.572 --> 36:35.439
'Cause I, for one,
am fully engaged.

36:36.941 --> 36:38.308
I want to solve this.

36:38.310 --> 36:39.643
Oh!

36:39.645 --> 36:40.994
Two events.

36:40.996 --> 36:43.830
One murder by subway train,
one disappearance.

36:43.832 --> 36:47.167
Event "A" cannot
reasonably be said

36:47.169 --> 36:50.003
to have any effect
on Event "B."

36:50.005 --> 36:51.955
Yet it defies reason

36:51.957 --> 36:53.590
to think that the two
are not connected.

36:53.592 --> 36:56.126
We know Vivian Tully is dead.

36:56.128 --> 36:59.329
We strongly suspect
Callie Burrell is dead.

36:59.331 --> 37:01.164
Drew Gardner, he has
no discernible link

37:01.166 --> 37:02.933
to Vivian Tully,
and therefore,

37:02.935 --> 37:05.302
no discernible motive
for her murder.

37:05.304 --> 37:07.938
He does, meanwhile,
have motive for his wife's murder.

37:07.940 --> 37:09.106
The marriage
was in trouble;

37:09.108 --> 37:10.490
she had left him
once before.

37:10.492 --> 37:11.942
The question remains:

37:11.944 --> 37:13.860
What are the odds
that the murder

37:13.862 --> 37:16.697
we think he is responsible for
on the subway platform

37:16.699 --> 37:18.532
would compel his wife to leave

37:18.534 --> 37:20.450
the marriage for a second time?

37:20.452 --> 37:21.735
How, in this case,

37:21.737 --> 37:24.871
does "A" lead to "B"?

37:26.324 --> 37:28.408
Maybe "A" didn't lead to "B."

37:29.193 --> 37:31.912
Maybe "B" led to "A".

37:33.665 --> 37:36.166
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you people:

37:36.168 --> 37:37.217
I didn't kill Callie.

37:37.219 --> 37:38.735
Well, as a
matter of fact,

37:38.737 --> 37:40.420
that's only one
of the murders

37:40.422 --> 37:41.722
that we're
accusing you of.

37:41.724 --> 37:43.173
This is the other.

37:45.643 --> 37:49.396
This is the woman Callie
talked about in her video.

37:50.548 --> 37:53.016
You think I had
something to do with this?

37:53.018 --> 37:54.884
Six months ago, you had a beard

37:54.886 --> 37:56.820
like the one in that sketch.

37:56.822 --> 37:59.406
You also owned
an army jacket

37:59.408 --> 38:02.242
with a distinctive
patch on the right arm.

38:02.244 --> 38:05.696
I gave that jacket
to Goodwill a long time ago.

38:05.698 --> 38:07.648
Did you give them
your beard as well?

38:07.650 --> 38:10.617
Or did you shave it off,
so you would look

38:10.619 --> 38:12.753
less like the man
who murdered Vivian Tully?

38:12.755 --> 38:15.422
Last night,
when Ms. Watson

38:15.424 --> 38:18.091
suggested you that you
might also be the pusher,

38:18.093 --> 38:19.843
I was confused.

38:19.845 --> 38:21.545
And that doesn't
happen very often.

38:21.547 --> 38:23.013
But in my defense,

38:23.015 --> 38:25.716
the sequence of events,
as I understood them,

38:25.718 --> 38:28.018
just didn't make any sense.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.469
You choose a woman at random

38:29.471 --> 38:33.190
and you shove her to her death.

38:33.192 --> 38:34.558
Several days later,

38:34.560 --> 38:37.594
the crime inspires your wife
to leave you.

38:37.596 --> 38:39.946
Now, the odds that the first

38:39.948 --> 38:42.783
leads to the second--
astronomical.

38:42.785 --> 38:44.901
Then Ms. Watson recalled

38:44.903 --> 38:47.103
that your wife
had left you once before.

38:47.105 --> 38:48.205
The video.

38:48.207 --> 38:50.207
You claimed that
Callie left it for you

38:50.209 --> 38:51.941
six months ago,
but that was a lie.

38:51.943 --> 38:54.244
She made it for you
a year and a half ago...

38:54.246 --> 38:57.130
the first time
she left you.

38:57.132 --> 38:58.615
That's ridiculous.

38:58.617 --> 39:00.317
Pretend for a second
that I'm right.

39:00.319 --> 39:02.502
The video is 18 months old.

39:02.504 --> 39:03.887
In it, Callie
references a woman

39:03.889 --> 39:05.589
that was pushed
in front of a train.

39:05.591 --> 39:07.207
"The woman
with the flowers,"

39:07.209 --> 39:08.975
to use her exact words.

39:08.977 --> 39:10.594
That would mean 18 months ago

39:10.596 --> 39:12.896
another woman was pushed
in front of a train.

39:12.898 --> 39:14.798
Another woman holding flowers.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.817
Her name was Anna Peters.

39:16.819 --> 39:18.902
She was standing
on a platform

39:18.904 --> 39:20.771
in Harlem when two teenagers
on their way to school

39:20.773 --> 39:21.888
got into a shoving match.

39:21.890 --> 39:23.139
One of them bumped her

39:23.141 --> 39:24.408
over the edge by accident.

39:24.410 --> 39:25.776
It was a big story.

39:25.778 --> 39:27.310
A lot of the media outlets
that covered it

39:27.312 --> 39:29.279
mentioned that Anna was
on her way to the hospital

39:29.281 --> 39:30.814
to visit a sick friend.

39:30.816 --> 39:32.582
When she fell, she
was holding flowers

39:32.584 --> 39:34.418
that she had picked
from her own garden.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.319
Flowers that
she was planning

39:36.321 --> 39:37.954
- to give to her friend.
- Hmm.

39:37.956 --> 39:39.790
That's interesting, isn't it?

39:39.792 --> 39:42.459
The man who murdered
Vivian Tully six months ago

39:42.461 --> 39:45.762
inexplicably gave her
a bouquet of flowers

39:45.764 --> 39:47.597
right before he pushed her.

39:47.599 --> 39:49.666
You gave her those flowers.

39:49.668 --> 39:51.385
Why?

39:51.387 --> 39:53.804
You thought you had
figured out a way

39:53.806 --> 39:56.106
to kill your wife
and get away with it.

39:56.108 --> 39:58.108
You'd use the video
that she sent you

39:58.110 --> 40:00.610
the first time she left you
to explain her disappearance.

40:00.612 --> 40:01.862
All you needed now

40:01.864 --> 40:03.647
<i>was a subway pushing</i>
<i>in the present</i>

40:03.649 --> 40:05.198
<i>so that the video</i>
<i>would make sense.</i>

40:05.200 --> 40:08.518
A pushing involving a
woman holding flowers.

40:10.739 --> 40:12.622
This is insane.

40:12.624 --> 40:15.525
You're just some woman
with a crazy story.

40:15.527 --> 40:17.411
You want me to be guilty,

40:17.413 --> 40:19.129
so you've constructed
this elaborate fiction

40:19.131 --> 40:20.831
to accommodate your theory.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.282
So, you're sticking
to your story, then?

40:22.284 --> 40:23.283
On the record, you're saying

40:23.285 --> 40:24.334
that you received that video

40:24.336 --> 40:25.552
from your wife six months ago?

40:25.554 --> 40:27.554
I am repeating that
on the record.

40:27.556 --> 40:29.489
Well, we rather hoped
that you would.

40:30.158 --> 40:31.475
We were granted access

40:31.477 --> 40:33.643
to Callie's e-mails
this morning.

40:33.645 --> 40:35.512
Obviously, you also had
access to those e-mails,

40:35.514 --> 40:37.898
because you needed to prove
to anyone who might ask

40:37.900 --> 40:39.683
that the video
came from her.

40:39.685 --> 40:42.602
You deleted the original
e-mail from her account--

40:42.604 --> 40:45.188
the one she sent
a year and a half ago.

40:45.190 --> 40:48.191
You then re-sent it
when the time was right.

40:48.193 --> 40:49.726
The thing is...

40:49.728 --> 40:53.196
we found it archived and
stored in the server.

40:53.198 --> 40:54.781
We know and can prove,

40:54.783 --> 40:57.617
that you received that
e-mail 18 months ago,

40:57.619 --> 41:00.704
a few days after Anna
Peters was murdered.

41:01.789 --> 41:03.623
But... don't take
my word for it.

41:03.625 --> 41:06.075
I'm just a woman
with a crazy story.

41:25.112 --> 41:26.596
Hey.

41:26.598 --> 41:27.931
You picked up.

41:27.933 --> 41:29.699
I'm glad.
I wasn't sure you would.

41:29.701 --> 41:31.785
I wasn't sure I would, either.

41:31.787 --> 41:33.703
About the other night.

41:33.705 --> 41:35.605
You were out of line?

41:35.607 --> 41:38.208
I'm not gonna apologize
for worrying about you.

41:38.210 --> 41:39.376
Listen, Em...

41:39.378 --> 41:40.777
I am, however,
going to apologize

41:40.779 --> 41:42.245
for doubting you.

41:42.247 --> 41:45.665
My editor just assigned me
the craziest story.

41:45.667 --> 41:48.284
"Man Pushes Woman
In Front of Train

41:48.286 --> 41:50.119
to Cover Up Murder of Wife."

41:50.121 --> 41:51.721
Sound familiar?

41:51.723 --> 41:52.756
Watson?

41:52.758 --> 41:54.791
Oh, hold on a second.

41:54.793 --> 41:56.960
Oh, uh...

41:56.962 --> 41:58.728
when you're finished,

41:58.730 --> 42:02.232
if you could, uh, join me
downstairs to peruse some files?

42:02.234 --> 42:04.234
An old colleague
of mine in London

42:04.236 --> 42:05.819
asked for my thoughts
on a homicide investigation.

42:05.821 --> 42:07.821
I was able to identify
the murderer

42:07.823 --> 42:09.222
in a matter of seconds.

42:09.224 --> 42:10.407
I would like to see

42:10.409 --> 42:13.410
how long it takes you.

42:13.412 --> 42:15.362
You enjoyed a modicum
of success today, Watson.

42:15.364 --> 42:18.198
Let's not let it go
our heads, now, shall we?

42:20.651 --> 42:22.502
Hey, uh, Emily,

42:22.504 --> 42:23.954
something just came up
work-related.

42:23.956 --> 42:26.823
Another time?

42:26.825 --> 42:28.675
Yeah, another time, okay?

42:28.677 --> 42:30.377
Bye.
