NARRATOR:
Previously on Continuum...

00:02.753 --> 00:04.038
They have tattoos.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.496
It's a series of dots
between their fingers.

00:06.591 --> 00:07.706
Who are "they?"

00:07.800 --> 00:09.791
ESCHER:
You call them freelancers.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.175
KIERA: What do they want?
ESCHER:
What everyone wants.

00:12.263 --> 00:13.753
Power. Control.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.138
I'll be running this squad
under a separate mandate,

00:16.225 --> 00:18.341
a separate budget,
and a new set of rules.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.142
It's time for the gloves
to come off.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.728
Waking up in a fishery,
it's 1992.

00:22.815 --> 00:25.192
So do you know what they do?
They stick me in a nuthouse.

00:25.276 --> 00:26.857
Yes. Yes, of course.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.609
Kagame wants you to go.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.983
What ifyou could
save tens of
thousands of people?

00:32.325 --> 00:34.111
Even if it meant
killing one person?

00:34.202 --> 00:36.614
I'm not gonna be whatever
it is you say, okay?

00:36.704 --> 00:38.114
I'll be something
different!

00:38.206 --> 00:40.288
I promise! People can
change, I can change!

00:40.374 --> 00:41.489
You are too dangerous.

00:41.584 --> 00:43.620
Please, just don't kill me,
okay, please?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.622
I beg of you, please!

00:48.299 --> 00:50.130
Thank you! Thank you!

00:50.259 --> 00:51.339
KIERA: What if this is it?

00:51.594 --> 00:54.381
My pointing a gun
at his head...
This whole experience...

00:54.472 --> 00:57.009
What if I'm the one
that creates the monster?

00:57.099 --> 00:58.555
Welcome home,
Theseus.

00:58.643 --> 01:00.508
You say these people
are my followers.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.059
Gather them.

01:02.647 --> 01:04.228
l have something to say.

(DOOR OPENS)

01:26.837 --> 01:28.338
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:35.680 --> 01:37.420
We're locked down.
How did you get in?

01:37.515 --> 01:40.222
Even in our final days,
we're not without allies.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.437
You're preparing
for eternity?

01:49.986 --> 01:52.022
I'm not
a believer myself,

01:53.781 --> 01:56.022
but we all
have been fighting
for freedoms,

01:56.701 --> 01:58.692
including spiritual ones.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.570
I've done things.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.785
Made choices
contrary to my beliefs.

02:06.377 --> 02:07.617
That's what soldiers do.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.211
Death may not
be waiting for us.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.878
I thought you said
you weren't a believer.

02:14.969 --> 02:18.211
Not in a higher power,
but in a message.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.466
Our message.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.514
Kagame. The teachings
of Theseus.

02:22.601 --> 02:23.636
What are you saying?

02:23.728 --> 02:25.935
Simply this,
don't fear death.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.229
Each ending is merely
a new beginning.

02:33.029 --> 02:34.144
KIERA: 2077.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.445
My time, my city, my family.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.648
When terrorists killed
thousands of innocents,

02:38.743 --> 02:40.153
they were condemned to die.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.359
They had other plans.

02:41.454 --> 02:44.196
A time-travel device
sent us all back 65 years.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.530

02:45.624 --> 02:48.752
but / can’t be sure
what / will return to
if history is changed.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.825
Their plan,

02:49.920 --> 02:53.208
to corrupt
and control the present
in order to win the future.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.164
What they didn’t plan on
was me.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.604
What about Gardiner?
He's gone radio silent.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.478
Well, if Gardiner
left his house
in the last 24 hours

03:13.569 --> 03:15.230
we would have something.

03:15.321 --> 03:18.484
Cellphone ping,
facial recognition,
bank use...

03:18.949 --> 03:20.860
I've had nothing on him
in the last week.

03:23.162 --> 03:25.198
Arc isn't some magic trick.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.699
It relies on real time data,

03:26.791 --> 03:28.827
which means things
need to be happening
in real time,

03:28.918 --> 03:30.499
not yesterday
and not tomorrow.

03:33.756 --> 03:34.836
What?

03:36.759 --> 03:40.627
Julian needs to be added
to the watch list.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.926
Okay, fine. Added.

03:50.856 --> 03:54.565
Alec, what happened
in the woods is done.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.268
Julian's moving on.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.445
Past Liber8,
past his own actions.

03:59.532 --> 04:02.239
And, if he keeps his word,
so will I.

04:03.494 --> 04:05.485
You really
went somewhere.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.327
I'm not sure I know
who you are.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.575
ldidn't hurt him.

04:08.791 --> 04:09.780
(SCOFFS)
You were ready to.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.864
But I didn't.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.959
That's who lam.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.751
Well, thank God,
Carlos could get through
to you, 'cause I couldn't.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.291
You did.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.551
In your own way.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.514
(BEEPING)

04:24.598 --> 04:25.713
What's that?

04:26.267 --> 04:28.223
It's Garza.
What?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.562
I've been trying to find
a location on her ever since
she grabbed me.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.228
Arcjust got
a facial recog hit on her
90 seconds ago.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.939
Where?
I'm getting
the coordinates now.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.401
Carlos.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.574
l'm...
I'm sensing reluctance.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.360
You're as sharp
as your suit.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.901
Then let me
put you at ease.

04:46.996 --> 04:49.954
You can start by telling
me how this is all going
to blow up in my face,

04:50.082 --> 04:52.118
because you're
involved, Kellog,
so I know itwill.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.459
Looking into Escher
is in our mutual interest.

04:56.589 --> 04:57.795
If I'm right about
his intentions...

04:57.882 --> 05:00.464
I'm more concerned
about your intentions.

05:01.719 --> 05:02.879
Hey, you Okay, buddy?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.377
Yeah... Yeah, fine.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.639
Uh... Escher.
You were saying?

05:10.478 --> 05:11.934
KELLOG: You have resources,
I don't.

05:12.021 --> 05:14.808
You need to think about
yourfuture, Lucas.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.851
I do,
butwhy should I put them
at your disposal?

05:17.026 --> 05:18.732

05:20.237 --> 05:21.613

05:24.575 --> 05:25.655
KIERA: Thanks, Alec.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.575
I had him cross-reference
every tenant in the building

05:28.662 --> 05:31.278
to draw a probability of
association with Liber8

05:31.373 --> 05:32.453
or the Syndicate.

05:32.541 --> 05:37.080
He came up with a 93.5%
probability for the person
in apartment 24.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.169
93.5% probability.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.542
That's the best he can do?
(CHUCKLES)

05:41.967 --> 05:44.549
ERT units are on their way,
we should wait.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.838
Look, we can either
stand around

05:45.930 --> 05:48.046
and talk about
catching Garza,
or actually do it.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.303
By the time ERT gets here,
she'll be on the wind.

is off the record.

07:28.324 --> 07:29.439
You're okay with this?

That's why I'm here.

07:32.536 --> 07:33.946
That's not what
I'm talking about.

Dillon just gave you
a free pass to use
any tactic necessary.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.034
And I intend to use it.

He doesn't have
the authority to do that!

07:40.085 --> 07:42.041
Nobody does!
Dillon gets it.

I can only imagine
what you would
justify doing to Garza.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.799
Why leave it up
to your imagination

07:53.891 --> 07:55.597
when you can see it
for yourself?

07:56.310 --> 07:58.221

08:45.401 --> 08:49.610
He told me about the message
he put in your head
about your purpose.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.194

09:07.881 --> 09:09.963
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

09:11.260 --> 09:12.750
It's the military chip
they put in her head,

09:12.845 --> 09:14.381
it makes her loco,
you better watch that.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.631
(GRUNTS)

09:17.641 --> 09:21.225
Maybe you need to wake up,
start thinking
for yourself, huh?

09:28.318 --> 09:30.274
This kind of tactic
gets us nowhere.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.104
Or maybe it got me
exactly what I wanted.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.147
She's all yours.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.819
Alec, are you there?

09:37.494 --> 09:38.449
I wouldn't miss this!

09:38.537 --> 09:42.121
I think Garza
just accidentally gave me
a way to locate Travis.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.242
How?

09:43.333 --> 09:44.948
She said my CMR
was military.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.370
Is it?
No.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.461
But she thinks it is
because that's what
she knows from Travis.

09:49.882 --> 09:53.716
He must have had a military
CMR implanted when he was
in the Super Soldier program.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.755
Now, I’m guessing
they deactivated it

09:55.846 --> 09:57.677
when he went to prison.

09:58.724 --> 09:59.713
But...

09:59.808 --> 10:02.094
Maybe we can remotely
activate it the same way
we triggered Elena’s?

10:02.186 --> 10:03.175
Exactly.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.726
And then we can
find his location!

10:04.813 --> 10:05.802
Can you do that?

10:05.898 --> 10:08.230
Uh, let's give it a shot.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.144
Okay, I've got
a general area. Gastown.

10:13.697 --> 10:14.903
All right, keep working
on the signal.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.446

10:26.168 --> 10:27.203
You Okay?

10:28.504 --> 10:30.790
You were supposed
to locate Garza.
Why haven't you?

10:30.881 --> 10:34.419
Normally they would be
holding her downtown
at one of the precincts.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.507
But the cops ain't acting
like cops anymore.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.711
No. They're acting
like a private army.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.259
Find out which precinct
has added security.

10:41.850 --> 10:42.839
That's where she'll be.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.516
I'll look into it personally.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.390
Make sure you do.
'Cause I take
failure personally.

for world domination
still on track?

10:56.365 --> 10:57.400
Yep.

What are they, anyhow?

11:04.248 --> 11:06.364
Like, does this have
anything to do with it?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.413
This is Arc.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.586
It's a way to take
the entire Internet
and distill it

11:13.674 --> 11:15.665
into one single page
of information.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.922

how do you want
to be remembered?

I thought you were
going to pitch me.

Well, I could do exactly
that if that's what you want.

But I'm guessing it's not.

31:53.454 --> 31:56.036
I'm wagering
that you see past

that you are looking
for something.

It's that simple.

42:28.004 --> 42:29.744
Thank you, Travis,

42:30.465 --> 42:32.626
for giving me something
I thought I had lost.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.174
Hope?

42:34.469 --> 42:37.461
No, the knowledge
that my fight
is not over.

42:39.975 --> 42:41.761
lam still a soldier.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.228
This was here
when I arrived.

42:48.275 --> 42:50.140
Now I understand
what it means.

42:50.235 --> 42:51.475
What does it say?

42:51.570 --> 42:53.481
"Your brothers await you
in the next life.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.400
"Do not seek them,
they will find you.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.068
"Trust in that."
