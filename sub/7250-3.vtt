05:36.211 --> 05:38.755
COFFEE BEFORE SCHOOL?

05:38.797 --> 05:41.300
WHY? DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT LEAD

05:38.797 --> 05:41.300
TO HARDER STUFF --

05:41.340 --> 05:42.592
LATTES, CAPPUCCINOS?

05:42.634 --> 05:44.469
FORGET I ASKED.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.388
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING

05:44.511 --> 05:47.388
SATURDAY?

05:44.511 --> 05:47.388
JUST MY USUAL CHORES.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.515
YOUR USUAL CHORES,

05:47.430 --> 05:48.515
JOHN-BOY?

05:48.556 --> 05:51.143
WHAT ELSE DO YOU

05:48.556 --> 05:51.143
CALL "HOUSE JOBS"?

05:51.185 --> 05:54.729
I CALL THEM "THE STUFF YOU AVOID

05:51.185 --> 05:54.729
UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL

05:51.185 --> 05:54.729
PROTECTION AGENCY STEPS IN."

05:54.771 --> 05:57.274
WHY DO YOU ASK?

05:54.771 --> 05:57.274
I THOUGHT WE'D

05:54.771 --> 05:57.274
SEE A MOVIE.

05:57.316 --> 06:00.027
YOU'RE NOT FREE BECAUSE YOU'LL

05:57.316 --> 06:00.027
BE WORKING ON YOUR APPLICATION.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.903
NO, I'M NOT.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.903
REALLY?

06:01.945 --> 06:05.907
IT'S NOT DUE FOR WEEKS,

06:01.945 --> 06:05.907
AND I HAVE THE TOPIC PICKED OUT.

06:01.945 --> 06:05.907
WHICH IS?

06:05.949 --> 06:07.034
HILLARY CLINTON.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.785
SOUNDS PERFECT.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.785
I KNOW.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.204
SHE'S SO SMART AND TOUGH,

06:10.245 --> 06:12.497
NOBODY THOUGHT SHE'D WIN

06:10.245 --> 06:12.497
NEW YORK, BUT SHE DID,

06:12.539 --> 06:14.791
AND SHE'S DOING AMAZING.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.791
HAVE YOU HEARD HER SPEAK?

06:14.833 --> 06:18.586
ONLY WHEN YOU PLAYED ME

06:14.833 --> 06:18.586
THE THOUSANDS OF HOURS

06:14.833 --> 06:18.586
OF C-SPAN FOOTAGE YOU TAPED.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.799
SHE'S A GREAT SPEAKER --

06:18.628 --> 06:22.799
STRONG AND PERSUASIVE,

06:18.628 --> 06:22.799
WITH A WONDERFUL PRESENCE

06:22.841 --> 06:24.676
AND HER SUITS

06:22.841 --> 06:24.676
ARE GETTING BETTER.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.762
I'D INCLUDE THAT IN THE ESSAY.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.762
ANYHOW,

06:24.718 --> 06:27.762
NOW THAT I HAVE HILLARY,

06:27.804 --> 06:29.931
I JUST NEED A DATE

06:27.804 --> 06:29.931
FOR SATURDAY. SUGGESTIONS?

06:29.973 --> 06:32.142
YOU'RE ON.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.142
GREAT.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.477
OH, THERE'S MY BUS. SIP.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.980
KISS.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.107
AND BYE.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.107
BYE.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.404
FAST RUNNER.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.404
IT'S THE COFFEE.

06:45.446 --> 06:46.740
NOT YOUR FACE?

06:45.446 --> 06:46.740
EXCUSE ME?

06:46.781 --> 06:48.075
SORRY, JUST MISSED MY YOUTH

06:48.116 --> 06:49.826
FOR A SECOND. I'M BACK. COFFEE?

06:54.831 --> 06:57.251
[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

07:04.423 --> 07:06.760
EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS THAT.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.760
THIS<i> IS</i> MY SPEAKING VOICE.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.511
THIS IS ITS NATURAL VOLUME.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.764
FINE! FINE!

07:10.805 --> 07:13.016
SHORT-SIGHTED MORONS!

07:10.805 --> 07:13.016
WHAT NOW, PARIS?

07:13.058 --> 07:17.604
WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY WE SET UP

07:13.058 --> 07:17.604
THIS SEMINAR. I SAY WE, BUT I

07:13.058 --> 07:17.604
DID MOST OF THE WORK.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.940
MR. HUNTER WON'T LET ME

07:17.645 --> 07:19.940
DO IT MY WAY.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.026
THE PANELISTS ARE THERE.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.026
WE SIT AND ASK QUESTIONS.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.026
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

07:23.068 --> 07:26.029
IT'S BORING AND PREDICTABLE.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.029
I WANTED CHARLIE ROSE.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.822
TO ASK THE QUESTIONS?

07:26.071 --> 07:27.822
HIS STYLE --

07:27.864 --> 07:29.866
I WANTED A ROUND

07:27.864 --> 07:29.866
TABLE WITH BLACK BACKDROPS.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.701
THE AUDIENCE WON'T

07:29.908 --> 07:31.701
BE ABLE TO SEE.

07:31.743 --> 07:35.414
THE LOSERS IN THE A-V CLUB

07:31.743 --> 07:35.414
CAN PROJECT IT

07:31.743 --> 07:35.414
ON A GIANT VIDEO SCREEN.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.126
AND ALL MR. HUNTER SAID WAS,

07:35.455 --> 07:39.126
PARIS "THIS ISN'T THE BEATLES

07:35.455 --> 07:39.126
AT SHEA STADIUM."

07:39.167 --> 07:42.337
NICE ANACHRONISM, HUH? LIKE

07:39.167 --> 07:42.337
THEY HAD VIDEO SCREENS IN '65.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.423
HIS REFERENCES ARE AS TOPICAL

07:42.379 --> 07:44.423
AS HIS SUITS.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.759
EVERYONE, CAN I HAVE YOUR

07:44.464 --> 07:47.759
ATTENTION, PLEASE, WE CAN

07:44.464 --> 07:47.759
GET THE SEMINAR STARTED.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.761
I'D LIKE TO BRING UP

07:47.801 --> 07:49.761
THE ORGANIZERS.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.680
PARIS GELLAR

07:49.803 --> 07:52.680
AND RORY GILMORE.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.478
THANK YOU, MR. HUNTER.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.355
EVERYBODY, THIS IS A SEMINAR

08:00.397 --> 08:01.940
CALLED "THE BUSINESS

08:00.397 --> 08:01.940
OF GETTING IN."

08:01.982 --> 08:04.734
ITS GOAL IS TO HELP GUIDE US

08:01.982 --> 08:04.734
THROUGH THE TORTUOUS PROCESS

08:04.776 --> 08:07.612
OF APPLYING TO AND GETTING INTO

08:04.776 --> 08:07.612
THE RIGHT COLLEGE.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.530
MY PANELISTS ARE JIM ROMAINE,

08:09.572 --> 08:11.741
ADMISSIONS OFFICER

08:09.572 --> 08:11.741
AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,

08:11.783 --> 08:14.869
AND IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE

08:11.783 --> 08:14.869
CONSULTANT ROSE SAMUELS.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.165
WELCOME, PANEL.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.165
YES, WELCOME.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.583
NOW, PANEL, YOU'RE ADDRESSING

08:18.206 --> 08:20.583
A GROUP OF KIDS

08:20.625 --> 08:23.920
JUST BEGINNING THE STRESSFUL

08:20.625 --> 08:23.920
PROCESS OF APPLYING TO COLLEGE.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.841
QUESTION -- WHAT IS THE BIGGEST

08:23.962 --> 08:27.841
MISTAKE A PERSON CAN MAKE

08:27.882 --> 08:30.510
ON HIS OR HER APPLICATION?

08:27.882 --> 08:30.510
MR. ROMAINE?

08:30.551 --> 08:34.181
WELL, FORGETTING TO SEND IT IN

08:30.551 --> 08:34.181
WOULD BE THE WORST MISTAKE.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.475
BUT PERFUNCTORY ANSWERS

08:34.222 --> 08:36.475
WOULD BE HIGH ON MY LIST.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.976
EXPLAIN.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.894
I'M TALKING ABOUT

08:38.018 --> 08:39.894
RUN-OF-THE-MILL RESPONSES,

08:39.936 --> 08:41.438
A LACK OF ORIGINALITY,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.606
PARTICULARLY IN THE ESSAY

08:41.480 --> 08:43.606
CATEGORY.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.984
IF I READ ONE MORE

08:43.648 --> 08:45.984
OVER-ADULATING PIECE OF PROSE

08:46.026 --> 08:48.569
ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON

08:46.026 --> 08:48.569
AND HER PROFOUND INFLUENCE,

08:48.611 --> 08:50.364
MY HEAD WILL EXPLODE.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.158
I HEAR THAT. SOMETIMES A MISTAKE

08:50.405 --> 08:53.158
LIKE THAT COMES FROM WRITING

08:53.200 --> 08:55.535
WHAT ONE<i> THINKS</i> AN ADMISSION

08:53.200 --> 08:55.535
OFFICER WANTS TO READ,

08:55.576 --> 08:57.287
BIG MISTAKE.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.287
AND SOMETIMES

08:57.329 --> 08:59.831
IT'S LACK

08:57.329 --> 08:59.831
OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.831
JUST AS BIG A MISTAKE.

08:59.873 --> 09:04.044
PERSONAL ANECDOTE.

08:59.873 --> 09:04.044
WHEN I WAS 12 AND I WAS WRITING

08:59.873 --> 09:04.044
THE FIRST OF MY TRIAL ESSAYS

09:04.085 --> 09:06.087
IN PRACTICE FOR

09:04.085 --> 09:06.087
THE DAY I REALLY WOULD.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.048
I CHOSE HILLARY CLINTON.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.385
THEN I REALIZED,

09:08.089 --> 09:11.385
EVERY BINT IN A SKIRT

09:08.089 --> 09:11.385
WOULD BE WRITING ABOUT HILLARY,

09:11.426 --> 09:12.927
IT'S GOOD

09:11.426 --> 09:12.927
TO CLEAR THE PIPES.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.138
NOW, WHAT ARE SOME OTHER

09:12.969 --> 09:15.138
MISTAKES?

09:15.180 --> 09:19.351
WELL, SMALL THING, BUT IF YOUR

09:15.180 --> 09:19.351
PRINTING IS BAD, THAT

09:15.180 --> 09:19.351
SAYS SOMETHING WE DON'T LIKE.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.561
IF YOUR EXTRACURRICULARS

09:19.393 --> 09:21.561
AND VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES

09:21.602 --> 09:24.356
ARE TOO "BY THE BOOK," THAT

09:21.602 --> 09:24.356
SAYS SOMETHING WE DON'T LIKE.

09:24.398 --> 09:28.068
YES, THOSE ACTIVITIES SHOULD

09:24.398 --> 09:28.068
HAVE A PERSONALITY BEHIND THEM,

09:28.109 --> 09:30.570
A FOCUS, A DIRECTION.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.570
I'VE SEEN APPLICATIONS

09:30.611 --> 09:32.822
WHERE THE STUDENT HAS CIRCLED

09:30.611 --> 09:32.822
EVERY ACTIVITY LISTED.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.741
AGAIN, YOU'RE TRYING

09:32.864 --> 09:34.741
TOO HARD THERE.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.784
ONE CAN'T BE INTERESTED

09:34.782 --> 09:36.784
IN EVERYTHING.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.619
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO'VE HAD

09:36.826 --> 09:38.619
COLLEGE PARAPHERNALIA

09:38.661 --> 09:40.205
ON THEIR WALLS

09:38.661 --> 09:40.205
THEIR WHOLE LIVES.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.457
TOO HUNGRY.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.457
IT'S A LITTLE IMMATURE.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.252
INTERESTING. INTERESTING.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.962
RORY, DO YOU WANT TO ASK

09:45.293 --> 09:47.962
A QUESTION?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.964
NO.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.964
WHAT?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.508
NO. THANK YOU.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.134
OKAY.

09:53.176 --> 09:56.555
SO, HOW EARLY SHOULD A STUDENT

09:53.176 --> 09:56.555
GET AN APPLICATION IN?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.140
BY THE DUE DATE.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.140
EARLIER MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.643
IT'S A MYTH THAT THERE'S

09:59.182 --> 10:02.643
A BENEFIT TO BE DERIVED

09:59.182 --> 10:02.643
FROM EARLY ADMISSION.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.522
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

10:02.685 --> 10:05.522
TALK ABOUT THE INTERVIEW PROCESS

10:05.564 --> 10:09.150
I BELIEVE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

10:05.564 --> 10:09.150
TO WEED OUT

10:05.564 --> 10:09.150
THE HYPER-INTENSE CANDIDATE.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.571
SHE'S MEETING YOU HERE?

10:09.192 --> 10:12.571
SHE HAD A THING AFTER

10:09.192 --> 10:12.571
SCHOOL, RUMBLE OR SOMETHING.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.114
SHE'D BE OVER AFTER.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.114
A RUMBLE?

10:14.155 --> 10:15.907
A BUNCH OF KIDS

10:14.155 --> 10:15.907
IN AN ALLEY,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.243
THEY PIROUETTE, THEY PULL

10:15.949 --> 10:18.243
KNIVES -- IT'S A WHOLE TO-DO.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.204
SO, SHE'S MEETING YOU HERE.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.204
YES, SHE'S MEETING US HERE.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.082
WHERE'S DAD?

10:21.246 --> 10:24.082
THE MAGAZINES!

10:24.124 --> 10:27.001
THAT WAS...WEIRD

10:24.124 --> 10:27.001
AND UNRESPONSIVE.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.796
THESE ARE COLLEGE ISSUES

10:27.043 --> 10:29.796
OF VARIOUS MAGAZINES.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.839
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING THEM

10:29.837 --> 10:31.839
FOR MONTHS NOW.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.883
RORY'S PROBABLY SEEN

10:31.881 --> 10:33.883
ALL THOSE, BUT THANKS ANYWAY.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.510
HAVE YOU READ THESE?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.510
NO.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.930
WELL, YOU SHOULD. I'VE UNEARTHED

10:35.552 --> 10:38.930
SOME SHOCKING STATISTICS.

10:38.972 --> 10:43.143
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

10:38.972 --> 10:43.143
HOW HOT THE COMPETITION IS

10:38.972 --> 10:43.143
TO GET INTO HARVARD?

10:43.184 --> 10:46.729
WELL, YEAH, IT'S VERY HOT.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.729
IT'S ONE OF THE TOP

10:43.184 --> 10:46.729
SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.191
IN THE WORLD! PEOPLE FROM CHINA,

10:46.771 --> 10:50.191
RUSSIA, INDIA --

10:50.233 --> 10:52.360
CHILDREN FROM EVERY COUNTRY

10:50.233 --> 10:52.360
APPLY TO HARVARD.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.028
THERE'S MORE COMPETITION

10:52.402 --> 10:54.028
THAN EVER BEFORE.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.989
REALLY?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.989
MOM, I KNOW ALL THIS.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.783
WITH THE DOT-COM BUST AND

10:56.030 --> 10:58.783
THE JOB MARKET DWINDLING,

10:58.825 --> 11:01.578
AND THE STOCK MARKET GOING UP

10:58.825 --> 11:01.578
AND DOWN LIKE A YO-YO,

11:01.620 --> 11:03.704
EVERYONE KNOWS THE BEST CHANCE

11:01.620 --> 11:03.704
FOR SUCCESS

11:03.746 --> 11:05.790
AND FINANCIAL SECURITY

11:03.746 --> 11:05.790
IS NOT JUST ATTENDING COLLEGE,

11:05.832 --> 11:07.667
BUT TO GO TO A<i> TOP</i> COLLEGE.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.461
THANK YOU. GOT IT.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.461
APPRECIATE THE INFO.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.506
EVERY CHILD THAT APPLIES HAS THE

11:09.503 --> 11:12.506
SAME HIGH GRADE-POINT AVERAGE.

11:12.547 --> 11:16.092
THEY'VE TAKEN THE SAME A.P.

11:12.547 --> 11:16.092
CLASSES AND THEY'RE ALL

11:12.547 --> 11:16.092
ON THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.469
THEY'RE NOT ALL

11:16.134 --> 11:17.469
THAT IDENTICAL.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.262
ONE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS

11:17.511 --> 11:19.262
OFFICER SAID

11:19.304 --> 11:21.598
THAT HE SOMETIMES PUTS A RANDOM

11:19.304 --> 11:21.598
STACK OF APPLICATIONS

11:21.640 --> 11:25.935
IN THE "YES" PILE AND THE REST

23:37.708 --> 23:40.920
I SAW THAT HARVARD LOGO

23:37.708 --> 23:40.920
ON THE ENVELOPE, AND I SAID,

23:40.961 --> 23:44.006
"RORY, GET YOUR NOSE OUT OF

23:40.961 --> 23:44.006

23:44.048 --> 23:46.800
WE HAVE A TV SOMEWHERE,

23:46.842 --> 23:50.137
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

42:15.992 --> 42:18.203
KIND OF.

42:15.992 --> 42:18.203
RIGHT.

42:18.244 --> 42:19.704

42:19.745 --> 42:21.831
THE NEWSPAPER STUFF

42:19.745 --> 42:21.831

42:25.918 --> 42:27.462
WHAT DO<i> YOU</i> WANT TO DO?

42:27.504 --> 42:29.088
I DON'T KNOW. LET'S JUST HANG.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.804
WELL, YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

42:36.846 --> 42:38.348

42:38.390 --> 42:40.683
HOLLOW" ON STUPID THE MODEL,

42:40.725 --> 42:44.270
AND I DON'T LIKE THE EXTRA "P"

42:40.725 --> 42:44.270
