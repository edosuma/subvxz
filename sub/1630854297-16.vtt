WEBVTT

00:05.073 --> 00:08.776
Brr. Too cold.

00:08.876 --> 00:11.312
Don't you wish you were a
detective in the early 1900s,

00:11.412 --> 00:13.581
when the victim was found
in a nice mansion

00:13.681 --> 00:15.449
by a warm crackling fireplace

00:15.549 --> 00:18.018
and all ten suspects
were lined up in the study

00:18.119 --> 00:19.320
next to the candlestick?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.055
Come on, New York,
all these lights?

00:21.155 --> 00:23.057
I don't even feel
the cold.
Well, I do.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.692
Hey, what do we got?

00:24.792 --> 00:27.528
Male, white, beaten to a pulp
and robbed of his wallet,

00:27.628 --> 00:29.663
so no name,
no address, no age.

00:29.763 --> 00:30.798
Great.
But he's still alive?

00:30.898 --> 00:32.966
Barely.
Hey, how's he doing?

00:33.067 --> 00:34.235
Severe head trauma.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.636
Let's hope he makes it
to the hospital.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.004
Well, there is
some good news--

00:37.105 --> 00:38.539
half a dozen people
saw it go down.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.208
Well, I'll take 'em.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.676
You go back to the hospital
and try to ID our vic.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.911
Nah, I'm already
half-frozen.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.879
Might as well stay
and finish the job.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.549
I'll talk to
the witnesses.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.520
Thank you, Tracy.
Amazing dinner.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.088
Yes, and this tiramisu?

00:54.188 --> 00:56.990
I could eat, I don't know,
a dozen more?

00:57.091 --> 00:58.159
I wish she was joking.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.727
Oh, no, I-I know.

00:59.827 --> 01:00.761
I've seen her shovel it in
since I opened this place.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.130
Oh...

01:02.230 --> 01:03.597
Chased with flaming
vodka shots?

01:03.697 --> 01:05.133
No, no, no, no.
Let's not talk about our past.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.334
Thank you.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.801
Speaking of, where's Sandi
tonight?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.204
Oh, Sandi moved to
the city last month

01:10.304 --> 01:11.639
to get into fine dining.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.507
Uh, Sandi is one of our

01:13.607 --> 01:16.277
Astoria She-Devil Crew friends. Oh.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.412
It was so good to see you.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.980
And you. Seriously...

01:20.080 --> 01:21.582
thank you so much for all
of your takeout orders

01:21.682 --> 01:23.050
that you put in
during the pandemic.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.419
I mean, you truly
kept us afloat.
See?

01:25.519 --> 01:27.988
And, Jamie, it is so good
to finally meet you.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.124
And you.
Such a dreamboat...

01:30.224 --> 01:32.460
Oh, my...
You burn my <i>bistecca</i>
every night,

01:32.560 --> 01:33.961
and now you drop
my glassware?

01:34.061 --> 01:35.596
Get it together, Stefano.
You get out of my face!

01:35.696 --> 01:37.265
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, really?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.400
I thought
you closed up already.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.569
They're old friends. Relax.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.704
Uh, this is my fiancé

01:43.804 --> 01:45.339
and our chef Mauricio

01:45.439 --> 01:46.607
and his cousin Stefano,

01:46.707 --> 01:48.442
who are always fighting.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.011
Stuff that goes on
in restaurants, I mean,

01:51.111 --> 01:52.613
Eddie knows
what I'm talking about.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.615
It was really good to
see you. Good night.

01:54.715 --> 01:55.883
All right.
You, too.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.518
Bye.

02:00.221 --> 02:04.124
So, congratulations
on your undergraduate success

02:04.225 --> 02:06.427
and good luck as you prep

02:06.527 --> 02:08.496
for the LSAT because,

02:08.596 --> 02:10.631
unless it's gotten easier
since I took it,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.566
you are all gonna need it.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.902
Just keep in mind,

02:15.002 --> 02:17.671
amid all the coming decisions
about where to apply

02:17.771 --> 02:20.641
and what type of law
to practice,

02:20.741 --> 02:23.977
that it is never too early
to give back.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.515
Uh, justice cannot prevail
without community,

02:27.615 --> 02:28.749
so perhaps find

02:28.849 --> 02:31.319
a local charity
and volunteer.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.620
A favorite of mine

02:32.720 --> 02:35.289
is the Tunnel to Towers Foundation,

02:35.389 --> 02:37.658
which honors the heroic...
Bobbi, I got to go.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.395
...sacrifice of the first
responders on 9...

02:41.495 --> 02:44.732
Erin Reagan, you've been served.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.806
Um...

02:52.906 --> 02:55.543
Excuse me for a moment.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.646
What?

02:58.746 --> 03:02.015
The sister of
Robert Davis is suing me.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.351
The guy from our office?

03:03.451 --> 03:06.687
She's claiming that
I made him take his own life.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.527
So, Officer Gillson
stopped the attack?

03:13.627 --> 03:15.863
Stopped?
Try a full-speed run

03:15.963 --> 03:18.466
and a flying leap
off a park bench,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.934
knocking a mook down
on his sorry ass.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.971
Then the mook got back up,
went after her partner,

03:24.071 --> 03:27.308
and Officer Gillson
stopped that as well.
Boss, this girl is a champ.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.909
And when the perp
then tried to flee

03:29.009 --> 03:31.645
and got hit by a passing car,
Officer Gillson did CPR

03:31.745 --> 03:33.314
till paramedics arrived.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.582
That part I could do without.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.150
Well, I'm sure
she could have, too.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.919
I'd sure like to shake her hand.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.455
And you will
at the press conference,

03:41.555 --> 03:43.156
right after I do.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.558
Where the hell's Garrett?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.394
Right here,
sorry for the delay.

03:46.494 --> 03:49.597
Call your contacts, G-Man,
we got a hero on our hands.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.732
Yeah, and please
don't say "but."

03:51.832 --> 03:54.134
But... I just got a tip

03:54.234 --> 03:58.138
that our hero comes with a,
shall we say, caveat?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.140
Could you be more vague?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.343
A PrivatelyPlus account.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.344
A what?

04:03.444 --> 04:05.779
PrivatelyPlus is a website

04:05.879 --> 04:09.049
where subscribers pay
to see naked women.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.018
Or men.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.587
Or sometimes feet or hands

04:13.687 --> 04:15.523
or other body parts.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.891
And you know this how?

04:17.991 --> 04:20.093
Because I live
in the modern world?

04:20.193 --> 04:22.563
Well, so do I,
but in moderation.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.532
So I'm guessing you won't be
clicking the link

04:24.632 --> 04:26.066
I just sent
the three of you.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.835
I get the concept.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.837
Don't look at me either.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.238
I mean, I want to,
but I won't.

04:31.339 --> 04:34.007
Oh, for God's sake...

04:34.107 --> 04:35.909
Wow, she's...

04:36.009 --> 04:38.211
And not just hands and feet.

04:39.847 --> 04:43.250
From a parade
to walking papers.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.953
Sorry, Carlie.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.288
She's getting fired for this?

04:48.389 --> 04:51.825
Cops have been canned for
posing for nudie mags before.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.727
Hell, we've dinged
some people

04:53.827 --> 04:55.896
for dancing in uniform
on TokTik.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.031
TikTok.
That, too.

04:58.832 --> 05:03.203
But Officer Gillson isn't
in uniform in the images.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.205
Isn't identified as a cop.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.141
Uses an alias on the site.
Who would know she's on the job?

05:08.241 --> 05:10.944
Well, whoever tipped you,
for starters.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.782
Her heroics make the papers,
everybody will, end of the day.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.021
Your thoughts, Abigail?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.457
I'm...

05:23.557 --> 05:25.626
still thinking them.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.321
Hey.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.923
Aw, we brought
each other coffee.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.425
Yeah, we did.

05:57.525 --> 06:00.528
I thought you probably had
a late night at the hospital.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.930
Figured you could use
some warming up.
That's true.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.498
Any luck with the vic?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.233
Well, he's in a coma
at the hospital,

06:06.333 --> 06:09.403
but I did find some <i>Lion King</i>
ticket stubs in his pocket.

06:09.503 --> 06:13.040
I tracked them down
to a Bill Duckworth, 43.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.676
He's in town on vacation
from Kansas City

06:15.776 --> 06:18.211
with his family,
who are now at his bedside.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.380
Sounds like you did
better than me.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.416
I mean, the witnesses
all concurred

06:22.516 --> 06:24.485
the perp was wearing
a black puffer jacket

06:24.585 --> 06:26.754
with a blue hoodie
and expensive sneakers...

06:26.854 --> 06:27.955
So it's unanimous.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.290
No. Not when it comes
to the face.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.561
Then we get "Male, Black,
30s with braids."

06:33.661 --> 06:35.563
"Male, Asian, ran right by me."

06:35.663 --> 06:37.831
"Male, white,
middle-aged for sure."

06:37.931 --> 06:40.167
"Female, Hispanic,
looked me right in the eyes."

06:40.267 --> 06:43.704
So, are all of our witnesses
lying, or are they just racist?

06:43.804 --> 06:44.938
Probably neither.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.307
I mean, some of them did
identify people

06:47.407 --> 06:48.876
of their own race.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.511
It just seemed like
they were filling in the blanks

06:50.611 --> 06:52.145
when it came to the faces.
A lot of people do

06:52.245 --> 06:54.047
go off half-cocked
these days.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.583
Yeah, the problem for us is,

06:55.683 --> 06:57.451
if we put the cuffs
on the wrong person,

06:57.551 --> 06:59.419
then they're gonna go
half-cocked on us.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.689
Well, I guess we're up a river.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.192
Yeah. Let's grab an oar
and start paddling.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.397
Lieutenant Gormley.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.399
Sergeant Reagan,
please sit down.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.167
Everything all right
with Lieutenant Fleming?

07:14.267 --> 07:17.437
Other than being stuck
in court all week, he's fine.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.473
But he did ask me
to assess

07:19.573 --> 07:22.209
a situation that's come down
the pike inside FIO.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.745
Must be serious
if he called One PP.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.046
Serious, maybe.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.414
Sticky, yeah.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.150
You dined at Marino's
last night, right?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.451
You want to explain why?

07:31.552 --> 07:35.155
Eddie knows the owner.
So we dropped in.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.624
How does anyone even know?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.626
Intel has eyes
and ears on the joint.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.127
You're joking. Nope.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.497
They think heroin, ecstasy
is being shipped here

07:43.597 --> 07:45.633
from Southern Europe
inside food crates

07:45.733 --> 07:49.069
and then moved to stash houses
up and down the East Coast.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.470
And they suspect Tracy?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.972
So you're vouching for her?

07:53.340 --> 07:55.509
No.
I mean, I just met her.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.877
But she's a friend of Eddie's?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.779
Yeah, whose judgment
I trust completely.

07:58.879 --> 08:03.751
Well, as you know, Intel ain't
exactly in the trust business.

08:03.851 --> 08:07.087
And you now are the point man
on the operation.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.122
Why me?

08:09.222 --> 08:10.624
Chatter on the wire
last night

08:10.724 --> 08:13.761
had an unidentified male
asking Tracy about you two.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.530
And apparently
they have no idea you're cops.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.032
All right, so I go back in
there, I figure out what's what,

08:19.132 --> 08:20.801
try to get enough to secure
a search warrant.

08:20.901 --> 08:24.004
Right, and as always,
it's on the QT, right?

08:24.104 --> 08:26.006
Can't even tell the wife.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.841
All right.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.813
What are we doing here,
Anthony?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.282
Getting some expert advice
from someone.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.984
And here he is now. Hi.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.185
Hi.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.020
Jack, what the hell...?
Um...

08:40.120 --> 08:42.556
You just mispronounced
"Great to see you, honey."

08:42.656 --> 08:45.292
I've never called you
"honey" ever.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.526
It's not too late to start.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.562
And you are a criminal
defense attorney,

08:48.662 --> 08:50.297
and this is a civil case.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.399
What we need is
his shark-like instincts.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.901
And Jack
agrees with me

08:54.001 --> 08:55.535
that what we should do is...
Actually, I, uh,

08:55.636 --> 08:58.205
I, uh, read the complaint
on the way over

08:58.305 --> 08:59.707
and, uh, I changed my mind.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.174
What the hell'd you
go and do that for?

09:01.274 --> 09:02.776
Well, what do you...?
Do you want my opinion,

09:02.876 --> 09:04.011
or you just call me just
to rubber-stamp yours?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.613
Guys...
Jack, we agreed

09:05.713 --> 09:08.348
that her office should
make her immune from litigation

09:08.448 --> 09:10.450
and she ought to lay low
to protect her campaign.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.419
Guys, I'm...
Exactly what I'm tell--
what I'm telling you now

09:12.519 --> 09:14.588
is that the best way
to protect her campaign

09:14.688 --> 09:16.590
is to act like
the prosecutor she is

09:16.690 --> 09:18.692
and to go after
Holly Davis tooth and nail.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.293
Big mistake.
Hey, guys...

09:20.393 --> 09:22.663
It's not a big mistake...
Hi, I'm still here. Hi. Shh.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.132
First of all, Anthony,

09:25.232 --> 09:28.702
immunity or not,
we cannot ignore this lawsuit.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.338
Exactly.
Secondly, Jack,

09:31.438 --> 09:33.073
I'm not going to attack
a grieving woman

09:33.173 --> 09:34.441
just to look tough.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.410
Do-do you even know
the details of this?

09:37.510 --> 09:39.880
Yeah, Anthony told me.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.215
Robert Davis was an
A.D.A. in your office,

09:42.315 --> 09:43.383
a secret drunk.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.418
Six months ago
you caught him

09:45.518 --> 09:47.020
throwing cases
for organized crime figures,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.356
you fired him, and then,
um, then he hung himself.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.759
And now you're backstabbing me
with this new opinion of yours.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.827
Which is a hell of a lot
better than doing nothing

09:53.927 --> 09:55.696
like you want to do,
which is nothing.
Wrong. Wrong-o.

09:55.796 --> 09:56.764
Okay. Hey, guys.
If we do that...
He's wrong.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.431
Hey...

09:59.432 --> 10:00.701
If we are gonna work together,

10:00.801 --> 10:03.436
you are going to have
to play nice.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.838
I'm playing nice.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.439
What?

10:09.677 --> 10:12.780
That was really fun
meeting Tracy last night.
I know. I love her.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.748
I just wish that
I saw her more.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.217
Yeah. So, you've never met
her fiancé before?

10:17.317 --> 10:18.551
Or that weird cousin?
No.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.087
But they were
probably just high.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.522
There was a lot of that back
when we all used to hang out.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.693
Really?
Yeah, I mean,
I never partook.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.527
Much.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.163
So people didn't care
that you're a cop?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.631
Well,
I wasn't one back then.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.734
And I rarely tell
my friends what I do

10:33.834 --> 10:35.368
'cause the moment
they hear "cop,"

10:35.468 --> 10:38.806
they think, "killjoy,
party pooper, narc."

10:38.906 --> 10:41.675
And Tracy didn't want
narcs at her party.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.011
What are you getting at?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.312
Nothing.
Really?

10:45.412 --> 10:46.513
'Cause it sounds like
you're accusing my friend

10:46.613 --> 10:47.948
of being a druggie.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.817
No, I'm just saying,
sometimes people dabble

10:49.917 --> 10:52.019
in that stuff and get in deeper
than they meant to.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.586
Well, Tracy would never
do anything to risk

10:53.687 --> 10:54.755
losing her restaurant.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.224
All right.
Okay. I'm sorry.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.892
All right.
No more accusations?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.227
I just said
I dropped it.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.763
Fine. Stop talking
about it, then.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.568
Officer Gillson.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.473
Let's have her.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.917
Please have a seat.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.671
If you'd like,
Detective Baker can join us.

11:44.772 --> 11:49.276
Thank you, sir.
But not necessary.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.758
So this isn't about the incident
in Prospect Park?

12:04.858 --> 12:06.794
Well, it starts with that.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.429
That was great
police work, Officer.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.299
But now I hand in my shield.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.302
The department has rules

12:15.402 --> 12:19.039
about what is acceptable
off duty employment.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.142
Especially if I'm employed
buck naked.

12:22.943 --> 12:27.214
It's not specified as such
in the Patrol Guide.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.183
But yeah.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.654
But yeah.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.591
I have gone great lengths
to keep it private.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.863
And yet it has already
reached my desk.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.666
The last thing that
I would ever want to do

12:46.766 --> 12:49.102
is dishonor this department.

12:49.202 --> 12:53.506
And anything that comes my way
is something I can handle.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.542
Well, yeah, just ask the perp

12:55.642 --> 12:57.177
from last night.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.816
But still...

13:02.916 --> 13:06.053
moonlighting on the job
comes with restrictions.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.089
PrivatelyPlus doesn't pay
its creators,

13:09.189 --> 13:11.658
so technically it is not
a subscription-based site.

13:11.758 --> 13:14.061
I only receive donations
from the users.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.663
A distinction without
a difference.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.766
If I may?

13:21.168 --> 13:22.970
A friend of mine dared me
to post a few pictures,

13:23.070 --> 13:24.804
and I was gonna
take them down right away,

13:24.905 --> 13:27.007
but it kind of blew up.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.643
And so did the money.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.616
Were you doing this

13:36.716 --> 13:38.418
before you joined
the department?

13:38.518 --> 13:40.453
No.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.589
I just started late last year.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.723
Why?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.258
Well, then I'm confused.

13:45.358 --> 13:49.796
I mean, why join the NYPD
if money is that important?

13:49.897 --> 13:52.866
I mean, we're not exactly
famous for our paychecks.

13:52.966 --> 13:56.336
My mom lost her job last year
and her health care,

13:56.436 --> 14:01.241
and a month later was diagnosed
with stage II pancreatic cancer.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.282
I've been there.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.118
I'm very sorry.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.755
Which is what everybody says

14:15.855 --> 14:18.791
because it's basically
a death sentence.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.897
And I'll be damned if I don't
get her whatever help she needs.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.401
And it's like you kinda said...

14:28.501 --> 14:31.871
I can't do that
on my paycheck alone.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.684
Right this way,
Mr. Atkins.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.454
Take a seat right
over there.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.823
I didn't attack anyone.

14:50.924 --> 14:54.461
Says the guy wearing the same
outfit witnesses described

14:54.561 --> 14:56.329
and who started
throwing punches

14:56.429 --> 14:57.730
when patrol officers
came up to you.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.300
Hell I did. They beat my ass
'cause I'm Black.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.701
No, they apprehended you

15:01.801 --> 15:03.603
because you beat
some tourist's ass.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.805
Matching another assault
you committed

15:05.905 --> 15:08.341
at the same exact
spot a year ago.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.943
That was some beef
with a guy I know.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.211
They said this was a robbery.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.779
Well, maybe
you're branching out.

15:12.879 --> 15:16.016
And maybe I'm only here because
of the color of my skin.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.685
Now, why does everything got
to be about color these days?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.420
It's only "these days"
to you people.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.623
"You people"? I thought
we can't say that anymore.

15:23.723 --> 15:24.992
You can't.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.459
And I thought police reform
was supposed to

15:26.559 --> 15:27.860
keep your foot off my neck!

15:27.961 --> 15:29.496
You're here
because you have

15:29.596 --> 15:31.364
priors for similar crimes,

15:31.464 --> 15:32.632
and you're wearing
the same clothes

15:32.732 --> 15:35.035
as the attacker,
and you have

15:35.135 --> 15:38.905
an active bench warrant for a
shoplifting arrest last year.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.174
Which means you'd be
here no matter what.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.311
Fighting with cops and having
a bad attitude's just a bonus.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.379
Okay.

15:46.479 --> 15:50.317
I've made some mistakes.
Some bad ones.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.120
And, yeah, I got into it
with the cops

15:53.220 --> 15:54.621
'cause I had
a few beers after work.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.124
But that's what I am now--
a working man.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.791
After my last stretch,

15:58.891 --> 16:01.561
I got a job apprenticing
for a plumber.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.063
I missed my court appearance

16:03.163 --> 16:06.199
'cause I was on a gig
out in Locust Point.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.500
Okay.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.868
Where were you
two nights ago at 10:00 p.m.?

16:08.968 --> 16:13.340
I was walking home
from the Low-Line Bar.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.607
In the puffy jacket
with the blue hoodie

16:14.707 --> 16:16.609
and the nice sneakers,
right in the path of

16:16.709 --> 16:18.611
where the robbery
and assault took place.

16:18.711 --> 16:22.415
'Cause I live around the corner.
Check my address.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.085
You're under arrest, Mr. Atkins.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.486
But I'm innocent!

16:26.586 --> 16:28.421
You're under arrest
for the bench warrant.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.656
While you sit at Rikers,

16:29.756 --> 16:32.492
we'll see if
this other thing sticks.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.532
Hey.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.701
Oh, my God.
First him and now you?

16:41.801 --> 16:43.770
Him who?
Your hot hubby.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.672
He was here, like,
20 minutes ago.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.175
It is so exciting that you guys
might invest in this place.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.443
Invest?
I mean,

16:50.543 --> 16:52.345
I thought he'd wait for me,

16:52.445 --> 16:54.514
but apparently
he spilled the beans.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.848
Well, he wanted to
look at the books

16:55.948 --> 16:57.450
and the cash flow, but...

16:57.550 --> 16:59.652
I told him Mauricio
would have to okay that.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.555
So, how did you meet Mauricio?

17:02.655 --> 17:03.923
It was just
before the pandemic.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.292
And he came in to eat,

17:05.392 --> 17:06.993
and he started giving me
pointers on the menu...

17:07.094 --> 17:09.929
Oh, well, that is
like foreplay to you.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.298
Oh, God, you know me.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.734
Yeah, so, um, we hooked up,

17:14.834 --> 17:17.604
and I made him chef
and then he proposed.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.739
Did his cousin come
with the deal?

17:19.839 --> 17:21.408
Uh, he brought Stefano
over from Sicily

17:21.508 --> 17:22.609
like a month later.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.844
I-I put up with
their fighting

17:24.944 --> 17:27.480
because they really did
zhuzh this place up.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.450
Uh, and speak
of the devil...

17:30.550 --> 17:32.152
Hey. Eddie, yes?
Sorry about the other night.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.322
Oh, hey, well, the way you cook,
all is forgiven.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.756
You I like.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.758
Her friend Sandi said
I ruined this place.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.727
Ran off to Jersey or something.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.363
Anyway, we got to,
uh, open, so, um,

17:43.463 --> 17:45.398
enough with
the hen party?

17:49.136 --> 17:51.638
I thought that you said
that Sandi moved to the city.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.907
Who knows? I mean, she
was always such a flake.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.978
But, um, I'll see
you later, okay?
Okay.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.787
Hey.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.523
Hey.
Still pissed
I called Jack, huh?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.125
You put me
in the middle, Anthony.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.394
Well, there wouldn't have been
a middle if he didn't try to

18:14.494 --> 18:16.396
convince you
to attack Holly Davis.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.797
Oh, so now
it's his fault?

18:17.897 --> 18:20.167
You've been saying that
about him for years.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.835
Can't I have a go at it?
You're like a child.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.537
The two of you.
Yeah, fine.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.905
But you're gonna take
my advice, right?

18:26.005 --> 18:28.208
'Cause his is dumb.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.244
You know he said the same
exact thing about you

18:31.344 --> 18:32.545
on my way in today?

18:32.645 --> 18:33.880
Yeah, well, he's wrong
and I'm right.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.815
Keep your head down
about this lawsuit

18:35.915 --> 18:37.517
and it's not gonna hurt
your campaign,

18:37.617 --> 18:39.619
your job or anything else.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.021
Sydney, what's going on?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.023
I'm transferring
to another bureau.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.225
What?

18:45.325 --> 18:46.959
Robert was my mentor
and a friend.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.829
And now I find out he killed
himself because you fired him?

18:49.929 --> 18:51.264
Sydney,

18:51.364 --> 18:53.099
the guy had his own problems,
I'm sorry to say.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.868
Well, I now have a problem
working for the woman

18:55.968 --> 18:57.970
who kicked him out
when he needed help the most.

18:58.070 --> 19:01.040
And you know?
I'm not the only one.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.051
Captain...
Hey, good morning.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.353
Oh, no, it's a doozy.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.987
My kid's sick with the flu

19:15.087 --> 19:17.190
and my dog took a dump
on my newly-cleaned carpet.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.391
Yikes.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.726
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.127
Janko, don't ask me
if you can ask me.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.929
Just ask me, you know?
Okay. Okay, okay.

19:23.029 --> 19:26.098
Back when you were married
and your ex was on the job,

19:26.199 --> 19:29.202
did he ever grill you about
any of your girlfriends?

19:29.302 --> 19:32.272
Oh, so Jamie grills you
about yours.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.940
I didn't say that.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.742
Need to work on
your poker face, Janko.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.010
And, yes, Steve grilled me
about my girlfriends,

19:38.110 --> 19:40.447
but only if they were hot
and he wanted to bang 'em.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.349
But Jamie would never.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.751
Uh... he did insinuate

19:44.851 --> 19:46.586
that she might be
up to no good.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.455
Oh, so it's an FIO thing.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.989
You think?
Oh, yeah.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.725
Their boss Fleming-- he loves
sniffing out wrongdoers.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.026
Maybe it rubbed off on Jamie.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.962
I'm gonna do some
sniffing of my own

19:56.062 --> 19:57.964
and find out why they're
so focused on my friend.

19:58.064 --> 20:02.235
Okay. So you tell me that,
and now I'm complicit,

20:02.335 --> 20:05.238
and now I've got
Fleming on my ass, too?

20:05.338 --> 20:06.239
Oh, geez.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.440
Why don't you just tell me

20:07.540 --> 20:08.708
you're planning on killing
someone?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.710
We can share a cell
at Sing Sing.

20:21.788 --> 20:25.124
Well, despite Garrett's
best efforts, the dam broke.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.527
Do I even want to know
the headlines?

20:27.627 --> 20:29.829
"Stop and Frisky" kinda wins.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.533
Circus never leaves town. No.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.067
But she left with her shield,

20:35.167 --> 20:37.203
so I assume she held
her own with you.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.905
More than.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.778
Time's up.

20:49.048 --> 20:52.319
Honestly, I'm still
not sure what I think.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.720
At first I was
with Sid--

20:53.820 --> 20:55.488
yeah, this looks bad
for the department.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.891
Then I started wondering,
why exactly?

20:58.991 --> 21:00.727
So she's naked, so what?

21:00.827 --> 21:02.562
Aren't we all
a couple times a day?

21:02.662 --> 21:05.298
Well, not for
all the world to see.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.500
If it bothers you, don't look.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.802
Oh, I looked at 'em.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.272
Pretty good pictures.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.107
She's very photogenic.

21:15.207 --> 21:19.045
Her pictures are tasteful and
she looks entirely comfortable.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.714
And I'm not gonna be
a hypocrite here.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.450
Brad Pitt drops trou
in his next movie,

21:23.550 --> 21:24.851
I'm first in line
at the theater.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.386
Abigail, I'm not a prude,

21:26.486 --> 21:29.656
but I am charged with
protecting this department.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.724
And you do a great job of it.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.726
And back in the day
this might have been

21:33.826 --> 21:35.728
a huge deal, but times change.

21:35.828 --> 21:39.566
And not everybody looks
at the same calendar.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.233
True that.

21:41.334 --> 21:44.203
But yours needs to be turned
at least to the current month.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.142
Okay. If you're so smart...

21:50.242 --> 21:51.844
why don't you be
commissioner for a day

21:51.944 --> 21:54.280
and you make the call?

21:54.381 --> 21:56.816
Oh, not on your life.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.186
Good night, sir.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.193
I don't know.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.901
You know, I should probably

22:15.001 --> 22:17.303
prefer our ancestors'
million different variations

22:17.404 --> 22:18.538
on the humble potato,

22:18.638 --> 22:21.708
but I choose
Chinese takeout any day.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.110
My mouth has never
been happier.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.746
I'm sorry,
that came out weird.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.780
Yeah.
Mm.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.049
But appropriate.
Dad, yea or nay?

22:30.149 --> 22:31.250
Yea?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.786
That's it?
Just a meager yea?

22:33.886 --> 22:37.056
Maybe Dad's busy thinking about
that naked lady cop thing.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.525
Ooh.
Hmm.

22:38.625 --> 22:41.227
If I'm thinking
about Carlie Gillson,

22:41.327 --> 22:43.329
I have to see 360 around it.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.164
And half,
she's a damn fine cop.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.866
"Fine" being the operative word.

22:46.966 --> 22:50.437
And half, she's potentially
a huge distraction

22:50.537 --> 22:52.539
wherever her tours
may take her.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.741
So, does she stay
or does she go?

22:55.908 --> 22:57.209
I'm mulling it.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.478
What's there to mull?

22:58.578 --> 23:00.312
I mean, how long
before the distraction

23:00.413 --> 23:01.781
cancels the skills?

23:01.881 --> 23:04.150
Oh, come on. What are
we in, <i>Downton Abbey?</i>

23:04.250 --> 23:06.719
And PrivatelyPlus isn't
just for young women.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.821
You know, they got all sorts
of categories--

23:08.921 --> 23:10.923
guys, girls, bikini,

23:11.023 --> 23:12.725
fully nude.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.827
They've even got women
as old as you two.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.329
Excuse us?

23:17.430 --> 23:19.932
I just mean older than myself.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.501
Uh-huh.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.736
Sounds like you're a real expert
on these websites, son.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.605
Yeah, I heard of 'em.
Uh-huh.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.239
Tap-dance all you want, kid.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.608
Yeah, 'cause, uh,

23:28.708 --> 23:30.710
it's a little too late
to take the Fifth.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.744
Point is...

23:31.844 --> 23:33.446
What is
the point there, Sean?

23:33.546 --> 23:35.247
Please.
Give it to us.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.649
...that nudity isn't
such a big deal

23:36.749 --> 23:38.851
to people who grew up
with the Internet.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.352
You know, it's like,

23:40.453 --> 23:42.388
"I wonder what this person
looks like naked."

23:42.489 --> 23:43.856
Cool. Moving on.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.124
Really, that ho-hum?

23:45.224 --> 23:46.258
Yeah.
All right. Well...

23:46.358 --> 23:47.794
you might have a point.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.862
The Internet has changed
our views of privacy

23:49.962 --> 23:52.164
and movies, music,
and everything else.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.200
So why not modesty?

23:54.300 --> 23:56.002
Well, I would like
to go on record

23:56.102 --> 23:58.971
and say that I know
a lot of old people

23:59.071 --> 24:02.942
who have never had any problem
taking it all off.

24:03.042 --> 24:03.976
What now?

24:04.076 --> 24:05.244
Excuse me?

24:05.344 --> 24:07.647
Pop, now is not the time...?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.849
It's not something
I'm ashamed of.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.017
Huh.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.519
Your mother wasn't either.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.287
Uh... what the hell
is happening?

24:15.387 --> 24:16.589
This has taken a turn.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.458
Betty and I once went
to a nudist camp.

24:20.860 --> 24:21.894
Whoa!

24:21.994 --> 24:23.262
Okay, check, please.

24:23.362 --> 24:24.831
Okay.
Oh... no.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.866
Sunshine Lakes,
in the Poconos.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.969
A week.
I never felt so free.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.370
Pop, we're eating.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.739
We were eating.
Yeah, but wait.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.174
How did you know he was
gonna say something?

24:35.274 --> 24:36.442
Well...

24:36.543 --> 24:39.278
I found a brochure
in an old trunk.

24:39.378 --> 24:40.813
Worst day of my life.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.049
And now it's
the worst day of our lives.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.984
Uh, am I too young
to have a heart attack?

24:45.084 --> 24:47.887
First, we find out Gramps
used to like to smoke pot,

24:47.987 --> 24:50.790
now we find out he used
to run around the beaches naked.

24:50.890 --> 24:51.891
With Grandma.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.192
Yeah.

24:53.292 --> 24:56.062
I'm a man
of many contradictions.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.831
Yeah, well, we didn't want
any contradictions.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.401
No, we just want our fully
clothed grandpa back.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.936
Proud of yourself?

25:04.036 --> 25:06.172
I am.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.510
Amazing.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.746
It's a gorgeous
two-and-two, move-in ready

25:13.846 --> 25:15.715
and walking distance
to Lincoln Cent...

25:15.815 --> 25:18.551
Mr. Vick,
let me call you back.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.088
What the hell
are you doing here?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.690
Hoping you'll talk to me.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.125
No, I'm calling my attorney.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.595
Please, Ms. Davis,
I know this is unorthodox

25:28.695 --> 25:30.296
and probably
really stupid

25:30.396 --> 25:32.498
since I'm the respondent
in this case.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.901
But there are things
you need to know.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.103
You killed Robert.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.638
What else is there?

25:38.738 --> 25:41.173
Your brother took his own life.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.842
Because you fired him.

25:42.942 --> 25:46.779
Only after I discovered he was
involved with a drug cartel

25:46.879 --> 25:50.583
run by a very dangerous man
named Manny Vargas.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.384
Did you know that?

25:52.484 --> 25:54.621
And it was Robert's
gambling debts

25:54.721 --> 25:56.656
that let Vargas get
his claws in him.

25:56.756 --> 26:00.392
And Robert would routinely
have multiple martinis at lunch

26:00.492 --> 26:03.195
and come back to court
half in the bag.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.865
Robert was
deeply compromised.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.800
And all of that
will come out in court

26:07.900 --> 26:09.501
for the whole world to hear.

26:09.602 --> 26:10.703
You're coming in here
with this crap

26:10.803 --> 26:12.538
to try and save your ass.

26:12.639 --> 26:16.108
Yeah, I am looking out
for myself. Sure.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.678
But I am also looking out
for a woman

26:18.778 --> 26:23.683
who is deeply in pain after
a terribly tragic decision

26:23.783 --> 26:26.485
that her brother made.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.691
He made a lot of 'em.

26:31.791 --> 26:35.394
But... he was a good man.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.763
Yeah.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.230
And I know that person, too.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.433
I worked side by side
with him for years.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.903
So...

26:45.271 --> 26:46.405
...what now?

26:48.574 --> 26:51.010
That's...

26:51.110 --> 26:52.712
totally up to you.

26:52.812 --> 26:56.883
If you want to go to court,
I will meet you there.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.450
Or we could...

26:59.485 --> 27:03.823
...keep talking about Robert
and the good man he was.

27:04.691 --> 27:08.527
The way he deserves
to be remembered...

27:25.177 --> 27:26.212
Lieutenant, what's this?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.379
A wrinkle...

27:27.479 --> 27:28.881
caught on the wire last night

27:28.981 --> 27:31.951
at Marino's asking
a bunch of her own questions.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.352
You went back?

27:33.452 --> 27:34.787
Yeah, because you...

27:34.887 --> 27:36.222
Officer Janko, when
it's your turn to talk,

27:36.322 --> 27:38.024
I'll let you know, okay?

27:38.124 --> 27:41.493
Right now I want to know
why your husband broke

27:41.593 --> 27:43.562
FIO's rule on confidentiality.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.897
Except I didn't.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.332
Reagans don't spill stuff
to each other?

27:46.432 --> 27:47.333
Yeah, right.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.600
And me and your old man

27:48.701 --> 27:49.969
do Pilates every day
at lunchtime.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.905
Sir, he-he's right.
He didn't tell me anything.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.542
Boss, let her explain, please,
because I'd like to know.

27:57.609 --> 27:59.879
I went back
under my own steam

27:59.979 --> 28:02.281
because my friend
is being weird

28:02.381 --> 28:03.682
and her fiancé's
even weirder.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.052
And then when
Jamie started acting weird,

28:06.152 --> 28:07.820
I knew it had to be
work-related.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.156
And my guess is, it has
something to do with drugs?

28:10.256 --> 28:12.925
See? My wife.
And a damn good cop.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.061
Yeah. Now she has to leave.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.830
Even though I have an idea
how to get to the bottom of it?

28:17.930 --> 28:20.132
Let me help out,
I'll tell you what it is.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.937
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Patel to Radiology.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.538
Dr. Patel
to Radiology.

28:26.638 --> 28:29.175
Ms. Duckworth,
we understand

28:29.275 --> 28:30.676
your husband came
out of his coma?

28:30.777 --> 28:32.044
He did.
He's gonna be okay.

28:32.144 --> 28:35.047
Great.
I was just
calling my kids.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.452
Mr. Duckworth,

28:40.552 --> 28:42.789
I'm Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.356
We've been working
your case.

28:44.456 --> 28:45.892
Tell me you caught the guy.

28:45.992 --> 28:49.295
We have a suspect in
custody on another charge,

28:49.395 --> 28:51.563
but we need a positive ID

28:51.663 --> 28:53.432
to charge him with
assaulting you.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.567
Take all the time you need.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.469
I don't need any.
It's not them.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.205
The kid was white.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.308
That's who robbed you?

29:02.408 --> 29:03.776
He robbed me, too?

29:03.876 --> 29:05.778
God, this whole city's a sewer.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.847
Can you tell us
exactly what happened?

29:07.947 --> 29:09.115
Whatever
you can remember?

29:09.215 --> 29:10.783
Look, I didn't want
to come here,

29:10.883 --> 29:12.985
but my family wanted to see
a couple of shows.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.788
Of course I'm the one paying for
the tickets, the crappy hotel.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.389
I only went out that night
to find a market

29:17.489 --> 29:20.659
'cause the room service
prices were so outrageous.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.494
So you went out,
you got attacked.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.063
Did this guy say anything?

29:24.163 --> 29:27.333
No, he-he just bumped into me,
so I say, "Excuse me,"

29:27.433 --> 29:30.069
and he just goes off,
like totally nuts.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.171
When you say he was a kid...?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.906
College-aged.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.374
His pals called him Spencer,

29:35.474 --> 29:37.676
and they must have been
in a frat 'cause I saw

29:37.776 --> 29:39.678
Greek letters
tattooed on his hand.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.881
A white frat boy
named Spencer...

29:41.981 --> 29:44.650
The last place
we were looking.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.089
So, Sandi,
you lied to Tracy

29:50.189 --> 29:51.490
when you told her
that you were quitting

29:51.590 --> 29:52.892
to join a restaurant
in Manhattan?

29:52.992 --> 29:54.493
To get into fine dining?

29:54.593 --> 29:56.328
I was scared.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.697
We had so much fun
till she met Mauricio.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.199
And then they started
partying day and night,

30:00.299 --> 30:02.768
and then he goes
on a firing spree,

30:02.869 --> 30:06.238
and then a week
after Stefano arrives,

30:06.338 --> 30:07.539
I saw the two of them

30:07.639 --> 30:09.008
in a walk-in freezer
opening a food crate

30:09.108 --> 30:10.642
and I saw what was inside.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.011
Was Tracy with them?

30:12.111 --> 30:16.215
No, but there were drugs everywhere.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.884
She had to know.

30:21.854 --> 30:24.056
Any decisions regarding
Officer Gillson

30:24.156 --> 30:26.592
will not be made
from our locker rooms

30:26.692 --> 30:28.928
or RMPs

30:29.028 --> 30:31.663
or the bars after tour...

30:31.763 --> 30:33.165
Ten-hut!

30:41.440 --> 30:44.010
Sorry for the interruption, Sergeant.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.411
Sir.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.879
Thank you.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.882
As you were.

30:52.784 --> 30:56.688
I am aware
that Officer Gillson...

30:56.788 --> 30:58.891
is currently working nights.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.360
And I am also aware

31:01.460 --> 31:04.696
that there just might be
a lot of opinions

31:04.796 --> 31:07.566
concerning a certain issue.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.501
So let's have 'em.

31:09.601 --> 31:10.903
Well, I think
she's doing a terrific job...

31:11.003 --> 31:12.738
All right, one at a time, please.

31:13.672 --> 31:14.573
Officer...?

31:14.673 --> 31:15.908
Justin, sir.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.745
Officer Justin, and speak up.

31:21.948 --> 31:24.316
Sir, the fact that she's
out on patrol right now

31:24.416 --> 31:25.484
is a joke.

31:25.584 --> 31:26.986
How? By being a great cop?

31:27.086 --> 31:28.454
'Cause that's the only thing
that matters.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.656
Yeah, Commissioner,
he doesn't speak for me.

31:30.756 --> 31:34.026
I've done a million tours with
Gillson, and she's top-notch.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.462
Yeah, but now the public's
gonna be making eyes at her

31:36.562 --> 31:38.464
and every other woman
on the job.
Thank you.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.599
Like we're not getting
dissed enough out there already.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.069
It's gonna be a sideshow
every time she's out there,

31:43.169 --> 31:44.603
and everybody knows it.

31:44.703 --> 31:45.871
Come on!

31:45.972 --> 31:47.006
How long till all this
blows over?

31:47.106 --> 31:48.107
A day?
If it ever blows over...

31:49.575 --> 31:50.676
All right.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.115
Uh, Officer Martinez...

31:57.116 --> 32:00.419
Officer Martinez, you were...

32:00.519 --> 32:03.455
her partner in Prospect Park
the other night.

32:03.555 --> 32:04.623
What's your take?

32:04.723 --> 32:06.425
That she saved my neck.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.527
I didn't know about this other
stuff till yesterday,

32:08.627 --> 32:09.628
and I couldn't care less.

32:09.728 --> 32:12.631
Carlie's a hero in my book.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.500
Pretty much all of us, sir.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.038

see how bad this ends.

Step back over here.
Second of all,

32:40.259 --> 32:41.893
we want to talk to you
about an assault

about that dude.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.278
So you admit you
attacked him?

32:59.378 --> 33:00.746
The guy was some hick
and got in my face,

33:00.846 --> 33:01.947
but it was all me.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.982
I blew a midterm that day
and some...

33:04.083 --> 33:07.019
chick on Bumble ghosted me,
so I went out and got hammered.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.787
And then you hammered
a complete stranger

33:08.887 --> 33:10.656
and stole his money?
I needed money
to keep drinking.

33:10.756 --> 33:11.790
Why not his?

33:11.890 --> 33:14.260
Oh, delightful. Yeah.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.195
So I'm going to jail now, huh?

33:16.295 --> 33:17.596
Sure looks that way.

33:17.696 --> 33:20.199
Can I put on real shoes?

Where's Tracy?
Where is she?

33:43.322 --> 33:44.356
I have no idea.

33:45.924 --> 33:47.726
Scumbag out of here.

33:48.727 --> 33:49.961
Police!

33:50.062 --> 33:52.030
Drop the knife!
Drop it right now!

33:53.132 --> 33:54.333
Put it down.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.570
Detective.

33:58.670 --> 33:59.938
Cuff him up.

34:08.247 --> 34:09.448
Tracy's not running.

34:09.548 --> 34:10.682
Yeah?

34:10.782 --> 34:12.218
But if she is,
I'll find her.

34:12.318 --> 34:15.087
Cracked this one open,
though, all because of you.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.301
Told you
I didn't do it.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.571
Yeah, you did.
But you did have a warrant.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.340
But I didn't do it.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.708
I know.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.678
I'm sorry I didn't hear it.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.481
It's 'cause I'm Black?
No, it's not.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.715
It's 'cause I'm a cop.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.717
Both things can be true.

34:46.518 --> 34:50.722
Look, I learned very early on
that bad guys come

34:50.822 --> 34:52.124
in all shapes,
sizes and colors.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.126
Black and white.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.961
Good guys, too.

34:56.061 --> 34:57.363
But...?

34:57.463 --> 35:00.299
But I also learned
that nobody can do this job

35:00.399 --> 35:02.401
without letting
their personal feelings

35:02.501 --> 35:05.704
about race and other things
get involved sometimes.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.773
We all make mistakes.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.841
Me included.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.011
And we can all do better.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.581
Anyway...

35:15.681 --> 35:18.083
Sorry I couldn't hear it.

35:19.318 --> 35:23.021
And I really wish you luck
turning your life around.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.124
Is this supposed to make
everything all better?

35:26.225 --> 35:27.426
No.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.363
I'm not sure I can.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.700
But maybe if you believe
I'm telling you the truth,

35:34.800 --> 35:37.236
I don't know...

35:37.336 --> 35:40.939
maybe somehow that can
keep things from getting worse.

35:52.184 --> 35:55.721
$1.4 million
in cash and drugs.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.423
Gormley said to say,
"Great job."

35:57.523 --> 36:00.692
Except that
Tracy betrayed me.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.861
You know,
we should just go home.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.863
I don't really feel
like drinking tonight.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.865
Girl, I know I did not
just hear those words

36:06.965 --> 36:08.133
come out of your mouth.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.236
What...? I thought
that you-you...

36:10.336 --> 36:12.037
Ran off?
No way.

36:12.137 --> 36:15.307
I may have scheduled the raid
for before she came to work,

36:15.407 --> 36:17.543
and after we reviewed
what we had on the wire,

36:17.643 --> 36:18.877
realized she wasn't involved,

36:18.977 --> 36:21.112
I decided to ask her out
with us.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.814
You thought that
she was innocent, too.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.716
I wouldn't go that far,
but she was your friend,

36:24.816 --> 36:25.851
so I rolled the dice.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.686
I'll take it.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.120
Hey...!

36:29.221 --> 36:32.358
Astoria She-Devil Crew!

36:32.458 --> 36:34.260
Excuse me, can we get

36:34.360 --> 36:35.927
three flaming
vodka shots, please?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.729
Actually, we have
a lot to celebrate.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.298
Can you make those
doubles, please?

36:39.398 --> 36:40.599
Ooh!

36:40.699 --> 36:42.468
Now we need to talk
about your taste in men.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.505
Yeah, not great.

36:46.605 --> 36:47.806
It's not great.
Whatever, it's not,
it's not great.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.375
It's not great, right?

36:57.583 --> 36:59.585
Hi.
Jack.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.119
Congratulations.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.489
I heard that, uh, Holly Davis
dropped her lawsuit,

37:03.589 --> 37:07.293
and I knew that that wasn't
because you followed my advice.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.297
I can't do things
the way you do.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.232
At least Anthony can't gloat

37:14.333 --> 37:16.034
'cause I know that you didn't
take his advice either.

37:16.134 --> 37:18.937
He meant well,
I mean, as did you,

37:19.037 --> 37:21.940
even though that pains me
to say.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.345
So...

37:27.713 --> 37:32.183
...are you gonna stay outside,
or do you want to come in?

37:33.218 --> 37:36.388
Um, probably not the best idea.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.057
Oh, is it the sweats?

37:39.157 --> 37:41.993
You're not into my sweats?

37:42.093 --> 37:44.930
No, I'm-I'm into the sweats.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.300
Um...

37:48.400 --> 37:51.303
You said that you and me
didn't work these days. Well...

37:51.403 --> 37:56.408
I have been known
to be wrong from time to time.

37:57.709 --> 38:00.412
I'm sorry, did...
did my ears just screw up?

38:00.512 --> 38:02.414
You know what I mean.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.185
Yeah, it's-it's, uh,

38:07.285 --> 38:09.154
it's probably still not
the best idea.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.390
Well, we have had worse.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.925
Right?

38:16.628 --> 38:18.330
Um, you know what?

38:19.698 --> 38:23.301
Just c-call me anytime
you need help, okay?

38:27.673 --> 38:29.575
Yeah. Okay.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.544
Uh, good night, Erin.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.882
Good night.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.092
Officer Gillson is here.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.827
Let's have her.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.096
Okay, but let's be careful.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.933
Okay. Copy that.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.509
Please.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.314
Commissioner.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.185
Have a seat.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.495
Thanks for coming up.

39:23.595 --> 39:24.730
Of course.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.998
Beat me to the punch,
in fact.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.969
That's not how I wanted
this to go.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.505
Only way it can.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.542
Look...

39:36.642 --> 39:40.211
I know firsthand how brutal
the papers can be

39:40.311 --> 39:45.050
to anyone on the job, but...

39:46.151 --> 39:49.721
It's not that... sir.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.890
Then what?

39:51.990 --> 39:53.224
I mean, yeah.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.561
It's no fun seeing my name

39:55.661 --> 39:57.796
and my photos splashed everywhere.

40:00.298 --> 40:01.467
But when news got out,

40:01.567 --> 40:04.736
my followers went
through the roof.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.940
Doubled, tripled...

40:09.040 --> 40:11.009
still counting.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.348
And with it, their donations.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.686
In amounts that
I can't turn down.

40:42.073 --> 40:44.309
You can put that back on.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.152
I can't give up the side gig.

40:56.755 --> 40:59.925
I have 35,000 cops
under my command.

41:00.025 --> 41:03.261
What they do on their own time
is none of my business

41:03.361 --> 41:06.565
unless they're breaking the law,
which you are not.

41:07.533 --> 41:10.201
So you're forbidding me to quit?

41:10.969 --> 41:12.370
I am.

41:13.972 --> 41:18.076
I can't afford to lose any cops,
let alone an exceptional one.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.226
Thank you, sir.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.329
And if...

41:38.429 --> 41:43.001
anyone comes at you
with this personal stuff,

41:43.101 --> 41:45.403
let your partner handle it.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.173
Save your adrenaline
for the folks who need you.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.441
Copy that, sir.

41:52.477 --> 41:53.712
And...

41:54.913 --> 41:57.849
...maybe could we...

41:57.949 --> 42:00.552
just skip the formalities today?

42:04.522 --> 42:06.692
Just...

42:06.792 --> 42:08.126
do your job.

42:08.226 --> 42:09.861
Come home safe.

42:12.931 --> 42:14.700
Thank you, sir.
