07:40.000 --> 07:41.793
Well, Ravi,

07:41.794 --> 07:43.584
since you broke

07:40.000 --> 07:43.584
something of mine,

07:43.626 --> 07:44.938
I have no choice

07:44.939 --> 07:46.250
but to break

07:43.626 --> 07:46.250
something of yours...

07:47.042 --> 07:48.167
No!

07:48.209 --> 07:50.375
Not my lizard sunglasses!

07:50.417 --> 07:51.810
- Mrs. Kipling
- bought those for me

07:51.834 --> 07:52.897
So I could be the

07:52.898 --> 07:53.959
coolest kid at Lizard Con.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.147
Yes, I realize

07:55.148 --> 07:56.292
that is an oxymoron.

07:56.334 --> 07:57.751
No.

07:57.792 --> 07:58.876
Here's what

07:58.877 --> 07:59.959
payback sounds like.

08:01.584 --> 08:03.292
(SCREAMING)

08:03.834 --> 08:04.834
(WHIMPERING)

08:05.542 --> 08:07.000
Luke,

08:07.042 --> 08:08.542
how exactly was that

08:08.543 --> 08:10.042
"smoothing things over"?

08:10.083 --> 08:11.876
- I smoothed things
- over for me.

08:11.918 --> 08:13.042
What?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.667
Oh, was that not clear?

08:19.250 --> 08:20.792
- I don't even know
- why we're here.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.393
- I'm never getting behind
- the wheel again

08:22.417 --> 08:24.292
- After hitting that
- hot dog cart.

08:24.334 --> 08:25.667
So much blood.

08:25.709 --> 08:27.042
That was ketchup.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.792
- Look, Emma,
- I know how you feel.

08:28.834 --> 08:30.334
I took my first driver's test

08:30.335 --> 08:31.834
in a tank.

08:31.876 --> 08:33.813
I missed a stop sign

08:33.815 --> 08:35.751
and completely demolished

08:31.876 --> 08:35.751
an old building.

08:35.792 --> 08:37.708
- I'll always remember
- the Alamo.

08:38.876 --> 08:39.938
Jessie, I'm sad

08:39.938 --> 08:41.000
enough right now

08:41.042 --> 08:42.833
- without hearing about
- your pathetic life.

08:44.042 --> 08:45.375
Can we please go?

08:45.417 --> 08:46.876
No, Emma.

08:46.918 --> 08:48.727
- Look, you don't have to take
- the driver's test today,

08:48.751 --> 08:50.334
- Just at least take
- the written part.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.042
- I mean,
- you studied so hard for this.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.876
- You even made
- your thinky-face.

08:55.876 --> 08:57.667
- I don't ever want
- to come back here.

08:57.709 --> 08:59.042
- It smells like
- old retainers,

08:59.083 --> 09:01.042
- And the people here are
- supes creepy.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.188
Emma, the people

09:02.189 --> 09:03.292
aren't that creepy.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.375
Really?

09:07.918 --> 09:09.042
Oh, hello.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.709
I really like your shoe.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.042
It sets off your forehead.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.834
- Hello, I'm Jessie
- and this is Emma.

09:18.876 --> 09:20.476
- She's just gonna take
- the written test today...

09:20.500 --> 09:21.959
I stopped listening

09:21.960 --> 09:23.417
after you said, "Hello."

09:23.459 --> 09:24.647
Here, fill out

09:24.648 --> 09:25.834
this paperwork.

09:25.876 --> 09:26.960
Wow, we have

09:26.961 --> 09:28.042
to fill out all this?

09:28.083 --> 09:29.042
We'll be here forever.

09:29.083 --> 09:30.834
Welcome to the DMV.

09:30.876 --> 09:32.230
Where one hour

09:32.231 --> 09:33.584
feels like a week.

09:33.626 --> 09:35.018
- Head over there
- to take the exam.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.334
- Your mother can
- go with you,

09:36.375 --> 09:38.042
- But she's not
- allowed to help.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.042
- Mother?
- I am her nanny.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.459
Her just-slightly-older

09:41.460 --> 09:42.834
nanny, for your information.

09:42.876 --> 09:44.834
Calm down, lady.

It's not like they

09:45.899 --> 09:46.918

- It's on too late
- for me.

09:51.709 --> 09:52.709
- I know.
- Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.814
Hey, Ravi,

09:59.815 --> 10:01.626
have you seen my new

09:58.000 --> 10:01.626
Car Wash Cutie poster?

10:01.667 --> 10:03.001
This month, Carly

10:03.002 --> 10:04.334
washes a convertible.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.751
Oh, um, do you mean...

10:07.792 --> 10:09.500
This?

10:09.542 --> 10:10.876
Hey, give her back!

10:12.042 --> 10:13.083
(GROWLING)

10:13.125 --> 10:15.042

10:33.419 --> 10:35.042
sounds like

a constipated lemur.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.272
Oh, forget it!

10:36.273 --> 10:37.459
Here you go,

- Okay, so we're
- both at fault.

- But what - Zuri doesn't know
- Can't hurt me.

11:01.709 --> 11:03.042
- How much of that
- did you hear?

11:03.083 --> 11:04.334
Enough that when

11:04.335 --> 11:05.584
I get through with you,

11:05.626 --> 11:06.834
you're going to be

11:06.835 --> 11:08.042
in more pieces than

- Madam!

12:08.856 --> 12:10.083
take your Chris Paul

autographed basketball

12:10.125 --> 12:11.709
- and bounce pass it
- to Bayonne!

12:15.440 --> 12:16.876
have this coming.

All I have to do is

12:17.919 --> 12:18.919
give it a little push,

12:18.959 --> 12:21.459
and your car will be

12:21.460 --> 12:23.959
as shattered as my dreams

12:18.959 --> 12:23.959
of being popular.

to destroy your...

nothing from my

if you failed the test.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.834
visit West Dakota.

13:02.334 --> 13:05.792
to drive again.

Emma, I'm not gonna

13:07.335 --> 13:08.834
let you give up on yourself.

Look, we'll practice

13:10.356 --> 13:11.834
every day, okay? I promise.

13:11.876 --> 13:13.334
So, can we make an

13:13.335 --> 13:14.792
appointment for

13:11.876 --> 13:14.792
sometime next month?

- It's what I live for.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:16.792 --> 13:18.397

13:18.398 --> 13:20.000
a valid driver's license

13:16.792 --> 13:20.000
to secure the reservation.

13:20.042 --> 13:21.376
Okay, but I'm warning you,

13:21.377 --> 13:22.709
my license photo

13:20.042 --> 13:22.709
is a little scary.

13:22.751 --> 13:24.268
- Oh, don't be silly.
- I've seen a thousand...

13:24.292 --> 13:25.709
(SCREAMING)

13:25.751 --> 13:27.250
Why were you growling?

13:28.876 --> 13:30.460
I was having a bad day.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.042
Much like today.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.688
Ma'am, this license

13:33.689 --> 13:35.292
isn't just frightening,

13:32.083 --> 13:35.292
it's expired.

13:35.334 --> 13:37.209
What? (SCOFFS) Fine,

13:37.210 --> 13:39.083
I'll pay the stupid fee.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.584
- Emma, can I borrow
- some money?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.876
- Plus, this license
- was issued in Texas.

13:43.918 --> 13:45.268
- I can't renew it.
- You'll have to take

13:45.292 --> 13:46.542
The driving portion

13:46.543 --> 13:47.792
of the test.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.792
What?

13:47.834 --> 13:49.292
Ugh, old people.

13:49.334 --> 13:51.167
(YELLING) You have to take

13:51.168 --> 13:53.000
the driving portion

13:49.334 --> 13:53.000
of the test!

13:54.959 --> 13:56.292
Fine, but can we hurry it up?

13:56.334 --> 13:57.792
I don't want to be late

13:57.793 --> 13:59.250
for the early bird special.

13:59.959 --> 14:01.000
Hard candy?

14:05.959 --> 14:07.167
Okay, it's been

14:07.168 --> 14:08.375
two hours.

14:08.417 --> 14:09.585
This ball is

14:09.586 --> 14:10.751
starting to get heavy.

14:10.792 --> 14:11.876
And you think they'd

14:11.877 --> 14:12.959
make these things lighter,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.396
considering nerds

14:14.397 --> 14:15.792
have to carry them.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.564
Before our next standoff,

14:17.565 --> 14:19.292
remind me

14:15.834 --> 14:19.292
to use the rest room.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.876
Okay, look.

14:22.918 --> 14:24.397
What do you say

14:24.398 --> 14:25.876
we all stand down

14:22.918 --> 14:25.876
on the count of three?

14:25.918 --> 14:27.125
Zuri is right.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.042
- Look at what
- we have become.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.001
We should put aside

14:31.002 --> 14:32.918
our differences and end this,

14:29.083 --> 14:32.918
once and for all.

14:34.042 --> 14:35.375
Okay...

14:35.417 --> 14:37.042
One.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.083
Two.

14:39.918 --> 14:41.209
Math makes me nervous.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.250
Three.

15:22.419 --> 15:24.042
It bounced off the awning

15:20.792 --> 15:24.042
right into the street.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.167
And into that parade.

There.

if I do say so myself.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.042

are terrible drivers.

You just talked

yourself out of

16:37.459 --> 16:40.000
a butterscotch, sonny.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.834
I guess I failed the test.

16:43.876 --> 16:44.960
On the contrary.

16:44.961 --> 16:46.042
You passed.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.042
- I did?
- She did?

She had a fender bender

True, but Jessie's

brilliant defensive driving

I also avoided that mime.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.105
I know.

17:02.106 --> 17:03.125
I docked you

17:01.083 --> 17:03.125
a point for that.

17:06.584 --> 17:08.271
Listen, there's no reason

17:08.272 --> 17:09.959
for all of us to get punished.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.584
- Only one of us has
- to take the fall.

Luke's right.

a first time offender.

Judge Jessie

17:16.731 --> 17:18.041
will go easy on you.

17:19.210 --> 17:20.334
if you get grounded?

It's not like this

17:21.710 --> 17:23.041

gonna get invited to stuff.

- invited to those.

17:32.626 --> 17:33.813
Well, then I am

17:33.814 --> 17:35.000
particularly offended

17:35.042 --> 17:37.042
- that I was not on the
- guest list last semester.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.251
Why do you not take

17:39.252 --> 17:40.417
the blame, Luke?

After all,

17:41.690 --> 17:42.918
what is one more black mark

- on an already
- besmirched record?

17:44.584 --> 17:46.042
Me?

17:46.083 --> 17:47.375
Oh, what about Zuri?

- She can just give Jessie
- the old "puppy dog eyes"

17:49.334 --> 17:51.254
- And she'll be back
- on the streets in no time.

17:51.667 --> 17:52.959
RAVI: I concur.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.647
Zuri taking the blame

17:54.648 --> 17:56.292
is the best of all options.

You know,

18:07.418 --> 18:08.667
all I really wanted was

18:08.709 --> 18:10.147
for you two to apologize

18:10.148 --> 18:11.584
for breaking my Ball.

18:11.626 --> 18:13.001
Oh, like you would have

18:13.002 --> 18:14.375
let us off the hook that easy.

18:14.417 --> 18:16.730
Yes, you are not

18:16.731 --> 18:19.042
exactly known for your

18:14.417 --> 18:19.042
forgiving personality.

18:19.083 --> 18:20.563
Actually,

18:20.564 --> 18:22.042
I might have surprised you.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.542
But you'll never know,

18:23.543 --> 18:25.000
because you guys didn't

18:22.083 --> 18:25.000
give me the chance.

18:27.667 --> 18:30.584
(GROANS) I feel terrible.

18:30.626 --> 18:32.000
Me too.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.334
Everybody gets invited

18:35.335 --> 18:37.584
to school assemblies?

18:37.626 --> 18:39.168
I can't believe we both

18:39.169 --> 18:40.709
passed our driving tests

18:37.626 --> 18:40.709
on the same day.

18:40.751 --> 18:42.147
I know. I'm sorry

18:42.148 --> 18:43.542
you had to take it

18:40.751 --> 18:43.542
in a waterlogged limo.

18:43.584 --> 18:44.584
I still have a polliwog

18:44.585 --> 18:45.585
in my pants.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.064
Despite that,

18:49.065 --> 18:50.709
you really inspired me,

18:47.417 --> 18:50.709

18:50.751 --> 18:52.042
Aw. Well,

18:52.083 --> 18:54.000
- it's what any great
- leader would do.

18:54.042 --> 18:55.105
What was it?

18:55.106 --> 18:56.167
My encouraging words?

18:56.209 --> 18:58.042
My never-say-die attitude?

18:58.083 --> 18:59.605
No, you drove into a lake

18:59.606 --> 19:01.125
and still passed.

19:01.167 --> 19:02.876
I knew there was no way

19:02.877 --> 19:04.584
I could do worse than that.

19:04.626 --> 19:05.855
Well, great leaders

19:05.856 --> 19:07.083
inspire in different ways.

19:07.751 --> 19:08.709
Next.

19:08.751 --> 19:10.251
Hmm.

19:10.252 --> 19:11.751
Oh, Miss Prescott.

Are you here to get

19:13.127 --> 19:14.459
your submarine license?

No. I already failed that

19:16.356 --> 19:18.209
test because I ran aground.

Ironic, isn't it?

- Mmm-hmm.

19:22.334 --> 19:24.209
- Swell. - Step in front
- Of the screen

19:24.250 --> 19:25.584
- And try not to
- spill anything.

19:25.626 --> 19:27.334
I'm also the janitor.

- Let me just fix
- my hair first.

- the glam squad come from?

20:00.083 --> 20:01.709

- in the Maldives.

- time to take one more of me?

20:21.459 --> 20:23.375
You drove me into a lake.

20:23.417 --> 20:24.626
That's... Fair.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.083
Well, my license picture

20:30.084 --> 20:31.084
came out great.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.250
Look, I'm glowing.

20:32.292 --> 20:33.522
Emma, I'm sure

20:33.523 --> 20:34.751
it's very pretty, but I...

20:38.250 --> 20:39.667
Wow.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.518
- It's a good thing - police officers
- Wear sunglasses.

20:41.542 --> 20:42.709
Yeah.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.044
- Meanwhile, I look like
- I got attacked by bees.

- Hey, everyone!
- Pizza!

20:51.459 --> 20:52.626
Awesome!

20:52.627 --> 20:53.792
I love pizza!

20:53.834 --> 20:55.210
Bertram didn't cook it,

20:55.211 --> 20:56.584
did he?

20:56.626 --> 20:57.855
Great, now that

20:57.856 --> 20:59.083
I have your attention,

20:56.626 --> 20:59.083
who broke the desk?

21:00.334 --> 21:02.209
Oh, dang it.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.939
I cannot believe we fell

21:03.940 --> 21:05.626
for the old nonexistent

21:02.250 --> 21:05.626
pizza ploy.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.167
Yeah, it worked

21:07.168 --> 21:08.667
better than my,

21:05.667 --> 21:08.667
"Hey, kids, Brussels sprouts."

21:08.709 --> 21:10.630
- You didn't come out
- of your rooms for a week.

21:11.209 --> 21:12.542
BTW...

21:12.584 --> 21:13.897
Why was Zuri's car driving

21:13.898 --> 21:15.209
down Central Park West?

21:15.250 --> 21:16.626
Because the traffic is

21:16.627 --> 21:18.000
terrible on Broadway?

21:19.209 --> 21:20.250
(SIGHS)

21:20.292 --> 21:21.584
Jessie, it was an accid...

21:21.626 --> 21:22.626
I did it.

21:23.417 --> 21:26.042
No, we did it.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.376
The desk, the car,

21:27.377 --> 21:28.667
all of it.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.417
Zuri is blameless.

21:30.459 --> 21:32.125
We're really sorry,

21:33.209 --> 21:34.500
for everything.

21:36.876 --> 21:38.709
- They're just trying
- to protect me.

21:38.751 --> 21:40.043
But the truth is,

21:40.044 --> 21:41.334
it was my fault too.

21:41.375 --> 21:42.522
Wow,

21:42.523 --> 21:43.667
so everyone's confessing

21:43.709 --> 21:44.896
and I didn't even have

21:44.897 --> 21:46.083
to get the hose? (GASPS)

21:46.125 --> 21:47.876
You guys are growing up.

21:47.918 --> 21:48.939
Does that mean you are

21:48.940 --> 21:49.959
not going to ground us?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.230
Aw. (CHUCKLES)

21:51.231 --> 21:52.459
No, you're grounded.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.626
But I'll tell your parents

21:53.627 --> 21:54.751
Bertram broke the desk.

21:54.792 --> 21:55.976
- I already told them
- he sank the limo.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.125
(CHUCKLES)

21:57.167 --> 21:58.459
That's a long story.

22:01.250 --> 22:02.772
Now remember, Bertram,

22:02.773 --> 22:04.292
before you cross the street,

22:01.250 --> 22:04.292
look both ways.

22:04.334 --> 22:05.667
I know, Jessie.

22:05.668 --> 22:07.000
I'm not a child.

22:08.751 --> 22:10.834
Oh, my shoe is untied!

22:10.876 --> 22:12.916
- Could you put the bunny
- through the hole for me?

22:14.709 --> 22:15.918
Fine.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.840
- But tomorrow morning,
- you're wearing Velcro.

22:19.542 --> 22:20.626
(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)

22:20.667 --> 22:22.042
Out of the way, tourist!

22:22.083 --> 22:23.918
(SCREAMS)

22:23.959 --> 22:25.272
You have to watch

22:25.273 --> 22:26.584
for bikes, too.

22:26.626 --> 22:28.209
- Maybe you should
- just stay inside.

22:28.250 --> 22:29.459
Agreed. (PANTING)

22:29.500 --> 22:30.751
But for crying out loud,

22:30.792 --> 22:31.918
would someone please

22:31.919 --> 22:33.042
just get me a hot dog?

22:33.751 --> 22:35.042
(SOBBING)
