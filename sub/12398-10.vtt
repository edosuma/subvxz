37:08.268 --> 37:10.554
Yeah, well, he's tough.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.471
He'll be annoying the hell out of you
in no time.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.481
And you?

37:19.154 --> 37:20.189
How are you?

37:23.158 --> 37:24.773
I'm...

37:26.661 --> 37:27.741
...glad to see you.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.831
We have to go.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.836
The guardian's on the move.

37:39.007 --> 37:42.499
He doesn't have the box.
And Ari's probably destroyed it by now.

37:42.677 --> 37:46.135
No. Ari told me he wants to keep it.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.797
They must think they can use it
for something.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.340
We got a bigger problem.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.180
The police confiscated this laptop
from the guardian.

37:53.354 --> 37:57.688
I took it when we left the scene.
Guardians are on secondary protocol.

37:57.901 --> 37:59.983
Wait. What are you talking about?

38:00.528 --> 38:04.316
All right. Primary protocol is to stay put,
guard the box.

38:04.491 --> 38:08.279
Secondary protocol is to pull stakes
and report to a designated location...

38:08.453 --> 38:10.364
...and await further instructions.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.654
Percy instituted it a few years back.

38:12.832 --> 38:16.040
-Why he cleared out of the farmhouse.
-Who can initiate secondary protocol?

38:16.211 --> 38:19.203
-Only Percy.
-That's impossible. He's locked up.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.587
What location?
Where are they going?

38:21.758 --> 38:23.965
I don't know. It was to be given
by verbal command.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.717
Which is why we've got to get going,
start tracking the guardians.

38:26.888 --> 38:29.755
They're gathering. Percy's behind it.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.515
We don't know if there's
anything happening with Percy.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.772
It's biometrically sealed.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.727
They can't decrypt it without
the guardian's blood.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.142
Which is why the box isn't an issue.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.651
The box is always an issue.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.730
Okay.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.775
I'll go after the guardian,
you go after Ari.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.693
And you'll be fine with him.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.156
No, Michael goes with you.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.366
-What?
-Hold on.

38:54.541 --> 38:58.375
There are at least three guardians.
You're outgunned. It's gonna take both.

38:58.545 --> 39:01.036
Nikita, ljust got here.
I can't leave you now.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.372
-This isn't about us.
-You have no way of finding Ari.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.256
Yeah, she does.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.878
When Ari started threatening me,
I figured I'd keep tabs.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.550
I put a tracker on his car.

39:13.142 --> 39:15.633
Michael, we'll have the time
to deal with this all later.

39:15.812 --> 39:18.394
You realize every law-enforcement
agency is on high alert.

39:18.565 --> 39:21.523
And you're chasing Ari Tasarov
into the heart of Gogol territory.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.308
You don't know where he's headed.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.272
Yes.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.189
But it's the right thing to do.

39:32.871 --> 39:36.284
You're right. I don't know
what I'm going to find there.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.370
Uncomfortable?
It's hard to go back.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.788
It's not my first choice.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.424
Mine either.
But it was necessary.

39:48.720 --> 39:54.556
However, punishment is only effective if
there's an opportunity for rehabilitation.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.643
I'm willing to restore
some of your privileges...

39:58.813 --> 40:01.520
...if you tell me everything
you told Alex.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.896
Where she's getting her resources,
who she's working with...

40:05.069 --> 40:08.061
...how much she really knows
about Semak.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.438
Let's start again.

40:11.993 --> 40:15.235
I told her she needs to think
about her future.

40:15.496 --> 40:20.911
And in order to do that, she needs to be
completely clear-eyed about her past.

40:21.711 --> 40:22.746
After all...

40:23.755 --> 40:28.465
...can't know where we're going
until we know from where we came.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.336
It's not an easy journey.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.675
It can be painful.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.681
Arduous.

40:38.561 --> 40:41.394
But if we have the courage
to face the truth...

40:44.609 --> 40:46.019
...it could lead to the right path.

PERCY:
That's something we all seek.

40:57.413 --> 41:01.031
You expect Alex to have
some kind of revelation?

41:01.209 --> 41:02.745
Clarity.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.956
Our memories can be
unreliable narrators.

41:07.465 --> 41:11.299
You may think you know
with absolute certainty...

41:12.053 --> 41:14.009
...what's in your past...

41:16.099 --> 41:19.307
...and then you ﬁnd out
you don ’t know the past at all.
