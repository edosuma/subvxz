00:03.937 --> 00:06.140
Previously, on E.R.:

00:06.140 --> 00:07.341
Who are you?

00:07.341 --> 00:09.210
Victor Clemente.
Your new attending.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.379
And congratulations, Doc,
you just killed me.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.746
Look, I know
what happened in Newark,

00:12.746 --> 00:14.715
and I really do not want
a repeat here, okay?

00:14.715 --> 00:16.149
Hear you're getting out
of here today.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.085
You thought it
stunk to work here.

00:17.085 --> 00:17.718
Try being a patient.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.087
Zoe.
Yes?

00:19.087 --> 00:20.388
Do you know
what you're doing?

00:20.388 --> 00:21.789
Yeah, I know what
I'd like to do.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.424
I'm your half brother.
Good to meet you, man.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.159
This is my wife Evelyn,

00:25.159 --> 00:26.494
my daughter
Jocelyn.

00:26.494 --> 00:27.795
This is Greg...

00:27.795 --> 00:29.463
my son.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.831
You don't want to have anything

00:30.831 --> 00:32.600
to do with me, but what
about your little brother?

00:32.600 --> 00:34.102
Oh, don't use
him like that.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.069
I'm trying here.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.537
Then stop.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.447 --> 00:48.349
You getting ready
for a roast?

00:48.349 --> 00:49.783
We got to clean this place up.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.552
Gallant won't be here
for another three days.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.187
Yeah, well, it's gonna take
a week to disinfect.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.655
I just want it
to be nice for him.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.090
He's been over there
a long time.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.491
Okay, come on,
we're gonna be late.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.130
Oh. Hi. I'm Zoe.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.232
Yeah, I remember.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.134
You have a cool place.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.668
Thin walls, though.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.438
Uh, sometimes
you really get it going.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.207
Yeah... Have you seen my, um...

01:13.207 --> 01:14.442
toothbrush?

01:14.442 --> 01:15.609
Sorry.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.777
Keep it.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.647
I have gum.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.415
You're just leaving her here?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.517
Why, you afraid she's
gonna steal something?

01:23.517 --> 01:24.818
She already took my toothbrush.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.454
Don't worry, she'll lock up.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.788
We gave her keys?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.457
Look, it's different with Zoe.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.459
There's something real
between us.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.494
Yeah. Real loud.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.599
They wouldn't admit
him because what?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.368
Too young?

01:40.368 --> 01:43.837
Yeah, we got a
NICU, but it's...

01:43.837 --> 01:45.706
not exactly S.O.P.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.341
S.O.P.?

01:47.341 --> 01:48.776
Standard Operating
Procedure.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.178
It's military talk.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.812
Ah, that must mean
you like him.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.582
( laughs ):
It's gonna take
a little more than that.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.817
All right, all right,
but you owe me, man.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.452
Lockhart.
Abby.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.821
Incoming.
I need a room
with a warmer

02:00.821 --> 02:03.424
set up for an
infant, miller one
and a two-five.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.892
Two-five?
What's it, a preemie?

02:04.892 --> 02:07.428
Yeah, but, uh,
we got it. Thanks.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.932
You can see it
in his eyes.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.235
It's starting to sink
in on the poor sucker.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.469
What is?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.538
That he actually works here.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.706
( chuckles )

02:20.741 --> 02:22.876
This is a special case,
needs to be treated on the DL.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.245
You follow?

02:24.245 --> 02:25.546
Is it your
illegitimate
love child?

02:25.546 --> 02:27.515
Try to be cool, okay?

02:27.515 --> 02:29.483
Nine-week-old with two days
vomiting, diarrhea and fever.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.219
Vitals?
Tachy, couldn't get a BP.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.621
How about a sat?
Probe wouldn't stick
to the fur.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.389
Hey, easy, easy, easy.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.525
Lockhart, this is Darwin.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.797
That's... the ugliest baby
I've ever seen.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.651
Okay, folks, the good news is

03:37.651 --> 03:39.420
the hospital has approved
four-to-one ratios.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.289
Finally.
Now, that means

03:41.289 --> 03:43.291
extra full-time
equivalents

03:43.291 --> 03:47.295
and zero, zero tolerance
for excessive O.T.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.530
Well, let's hope we
have enough people to
fill all those shifts.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.998
DUBENKO:
Sam, you got a haircut.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.866
No, it's just high... lights.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.035
Good morning, E.R. staff.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.405
So it's true--
we're not alone.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.539
EVE:
What's going on?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.408
Well, this device was designed

04:00.408 --> 04:02.510
to offer remote
surgical consults.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.678
So, since
I'm still at home recovering,

04:04.678 --> 04:06.780
I thought I'd give it
a test drive.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.882
Okay, meeting's over.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.452
Uh, nurses, nurses, uh,
for the sake of the trial

04:11.452 --> 04:13.321
I'm gonna need a few things.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.856
Damn, I miss the Bronx.
This is why
I don't have cable.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.057
How are you doing that?

04:17.057 --> 04:18.726
I have a joystick in my lap.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.793
That is too much
information.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.530
Sam, we're gonna
be in sutures.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.797
You need help?

04:23.797 --> 04:24.998
No, that's okay, we got it.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.967
Morning, Dr. Lockhart.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.471
Some kid in triage
asking for you.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.939
Yeah, tell him
to take a number.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.974
He says he knows you.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.877
( sighs ):
Uh, yeah, um...

04:36.877 --> 04:39.813
set him up in two, okay?
Okay.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.352
Haleh, walk with me.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.619
You sure like to walk.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.521
Remember that little
chat we had?

04:47.521 --> 04:49.890
No more O.T.-- I did
what I promised.

04:49.890 --> 04:53.761
( laughs ):
You're picking up extra time
by taking shifts in ICU.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.996
Well, you never
said I couldn't.
Yeah, I also didn't say

04:55.996 --> 04:57.898
you couldn't start flipping
burgers around the corner,

04:57.898 --> 04:58.932
or turning tricks
in Lincoln Park.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.701
Excuse me?!

05:00.701 --> 05:04.037
It's overtime-- you know
what I'm talking about.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.941
I'm sorry-- it
won't happen again.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.446
Good boy.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.882
Okay, his temperature's only 94.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.751
I must have skipped
school the day they
taught monkey veins.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.920
Word on the street is,
you give good neonate.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.823
Human neonate, Dr. Moreau.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.592
Bet you didn't know
that chimps and humans

05:24.592 --> 05:26.093
share 96% of their DNA,
did you?

05:26.093 --> 05:27.795
I know--
it's fascinating.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.797
So this is what happened,
so Darwin's handler

05:29.797 --> 05:32.433
calls me up and tells
me that the vet's
kind of nervous.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.468
So he figures this
little guy's best shot
is here with me.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.504
Oh, of course he does.
Tachy,

05:36.504 --> 05:39.940
carotid's weak.
And this handler,
he knows you because, what,

05:39.940 --> 05:41.509
you went to clown
school together?

05:41.509 --> 05:43.944
How'd you guess?
No, I'm serious.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.913
I was at NYU while
he was at Ringling Brothers.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.148
I had kind of a...
circus thing.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.850
Okay.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.421
We need access, Lockhart.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.656
Right. Abby. I'm gonna try
to find a transilluminator.

05:55.656 --> 05:59.092
Is there anyone else
we can trust?
What are we doing?

05:59.092 --> 06:00.961
I-I'm an attending--
I can't spend all day

06:00.961 --> 06:02.596
in here with a chimp.
I know.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.064
So what are we doing?

06:05.666 --> 06:08.068
Go, go, go, okay? Go, go.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.840
Don't forget
the knock, okay?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.942
( whispers ):
Please, go.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.844
Hey, I heard you have
a baby in there.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.846
You need some help?
No. I, uh... we got it.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.949
Is it cute?
Yes, it's a...
hairy little monkey.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.751
I love babies.
And babies love me.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.118
I just have a
way with them.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.487
Can you get me
a transilluminator?

06:26.487 --> 06:29.590
I'm like the wind.
Thanks.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.493
Oh, hey, Neela, um,
do you have a minute?

06:32.493 --> 06:34.862
We could use
an extra set of hands.
"We"?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.797
Clemente and I have
a-a patient.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.566
Sure.

06:38.566 --> 06:39.933
( sighs )

06:42.135 --> 06:43.637
CLEMENTE ( quietly ):
Come on, hurry up.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.038
Transilluminator was MIA,
but I...

06:45.038 --> 06:47.575
Forget that, I got a 24
into the antecube.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.910
Oh. Wait. What?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.212
NEELA:
Uh...

06:52.212 --> 06:54.548
you two do realize
that's a monkey.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.016
Chimp, actually.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.184
ABBY:
96% human.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.652
Who knew?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.488
So how'd this happen?

07:00.488 --> 07:04.024
Aw, I was just
horsing around.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.059
Looks like you did a little bit
more than that to me.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.562
Got in a fight.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.730
Where, at school?

07:09.730 --> 07:11.131
Nah, at home.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.800
With Dad.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.034
Did he hit you?

07:14.034 --> 07:16.537
Nah, man, he doesn't do that.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.772
So what were you fighting about?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.608
I always felt
there was something going on

07:20.608 --> 07:22.876
at my house
I didn't know about.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.878
Then I met you, and...

07:24.878 --> 07:26.547
I got it.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.549
It was like...

07:28.549 --> 07:30.818
it was like
a cloud was lifted.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.620
But the cloud came back.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.688
You mean
'cause I cut off Charlie?

07:34.688 --> 07:37.124
Not just him, man,
you cut me off, too.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.693
I don't want it
to be like that.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.662
I mean, ain't we brothers?

07:41.662 --> 07:43.697
( sighs )

07:43.697 --> 07:46.600
This may be worse off
than it looks.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.072
( knocking )

07:52.072 --> 07:54.642
Sounds like they need this room
for an actual patient.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.710
You know, another thing
they share with humans

07:56.710 --> 07:59.547
is a tendency to get
sepsis as neonates, so...

07:59.547 --> 08:01.615
( phone rings )
let's go
with a CBC,

08:01.615 --> 08:03.216
d-stick, cultures,
portable chest

08:03.216 --> 08:05.018
and 20cc's per
kilo bolus.
Oh, that's it?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.253
No foley? No LP?

08:06.253 --> 08:07.655
Tap might be
jumping the gun,

08:07.655 --> 08:09.590
but foley's not
a bad idea.

08:09.590 --> 08:13.026
Hold on... hold on a second.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.928
( over speaker ):
Hello, Dr. Clemente?
Yes, Eve.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.564
We're over in Trauma Two

08:16.564 --> 08:18.198
with our friend Jessie,
who has multiple fractures

08:18.198 --> 08:19.967
from a fall.
Yeah, yeah.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.069
We were just wondering
if it would be possible

08:22.069 --> 08:23.871
for you to get your ass in here?

08:26.306 --> 08:28.108
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.611
Shake a leg, okay?
'Cause if this chimp

08:30.611 --> 08:32.813
gets sepsis,
he could crump at any minute.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.047
And lock the door.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.653
We should take
the core temp.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.255
I'm not sticking anything
up this monkey's ass.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.890
You know, if I had a nickel
for every time I said that...

09:16.890 --> 09:19.627
How about we flip for it?
Fine.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.261
Hey, Abby,
the transilluminator's missing

09:21.261 --> 09:22.630
a bulb,
but I thought I'd give you

09:22.630 --> 09:23.964
a little help with
the sweet lit...

09:23.964 --> 09:25.799
( gasps ):
By all that is good

09:25.799 --> 09:27.701
and holy, what
diabolical spell

09:27.701 --> 09:29.302
have you cast
on this child?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.874
Dr. Pratt, can you
sign off on this chart?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.275
Hey, who's it for?
The kid in two

09:35.275 --> 09:37.310
who got into it
with his father.
Wait. What?!

09:37.310 --> 09:39.079
Social worker's
in with him now.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.782
You weren't supposed
to do a chart!
I had to do a chart.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.084
No, no, no!
It's not like that!
Eve's strict with this stuff.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.386
Suspicion of abuse--
I have to call them in.
Damn!

09:46.386 --> 09:49.056
Look, I don't need any help
from you-- I'm fine.
That's not how it looks.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.224
Man, why do I got to go
through all this with her?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.694
I'm Dr. Pratt.
Liz Dade,
social work.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.663
Yeah, can I talk to you outside
for a minute?
When I'm finished here.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.731
Look, see, the thing is...
I'm not finished yet.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.399
Well, I think you should be.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.835
Look, the nurse
jumped the gun, okay?
I know this family.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.070
It's a stable home.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.905
It's just an innocent argument.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.274
The kid just got
a little too steamed.
Is that so?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.743
Yeah.
And nobody
hit anybody?

10:09.743 --> 10:11.378
I just got real mad
at a chair.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.114
( chuckles ):
That's not gonna do it.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.249
Okay, look, all right...

10:16.249 --> 10:18.686
He's my brother.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.988
Okay?
His brother.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.757
Yeah. Same last name,
check it out.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.058
Why didn't you
just say so?

10:25.058 --> 10:26.159
I'll do a follow-up
phone call.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.661
( screaming )
Sally!

10:27.661 --> 10:30.330
SALLY:
Tom Cruise? Retarded!

10:30.330 --> 10:33.066
Sally.
Sammy Sosa? Retarded!

10:33.066 --> 10:35.202
( screams, groans )

10:35.202 --> 10:37.738
Son of a... bitch!

10:41.008 --> 10:42.409
Sam.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.312
( laughs ):
Ah. Um... yeah, I just...

10:45.312 --> 10:46.413
No, that's all right.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.182
How retarded was that, huh?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.118
Listen, I overheard you
talking to Inez.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.220
Oh, yeah, sorry about that, Eve.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.122
It's just sometimes she needs
a little bit of guidance.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.390
Oh, no, that's okay-- I'm
actually really impressed.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.093
You have fantastic
interpersonal skills.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.929
The younger nurses
respect you,

11:01.929 --> 11:04.798
the older ones trust you.
Oh, thanks.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.400
So I think it's time
you moved up the ladder.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.401
( chuckles ):
What ladder?

11:08.401 --> 11:10.270
Nursing administration.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.105
I'm pretty happy
doing what I'm doing.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.440
Your job wouldn't
change that much.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.208
You'd help out
with staff education,

11:15.208 --> 11:17.845
implementing nursing policies
and procedures.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.848
Sounds like a lot of work.
There'd be a big pay hike.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.017
How big?

11:24.017 --> 11:27.154
Shopping on Michigan
Avenue big.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.756
Well, if you put it
that way...

11:28.756 --> 11:30.223
( chuckles )
when do I start?

11:30.223 --> 11:33.093
Right away. First thing I need
you to do is fire Haleh.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.327
Hold on. What?

11:34.327 --> 11:35.996
Welcome to management.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.134
Eve.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.135
Is it done?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.804
No.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.005
Inez, How's that pulse ox
probe working out?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.774
Fine
Okay.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.375
I'm not going
to fire Haleh.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.877
Hey, management's
a bitch.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.211
Yeah, and not
the only one.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.781
You know, Haleh's
been warned three times,

11:53.781 --> 11:54.414
twice in writing.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.116
She has?

11:56.116 --> 11:58.218
With all the O.T. she's doing,
we could hire two nurses

11:58.218 --> 11:59.787
and still have enough
for a wet bar

11:59.787 --> 12:00.854
in the lounge.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.489
Well, then let's counsel her.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.324
Oh, yeah, you're
confusing me with Oprah.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.160
Dr. Clemente, did you send in
this patient in sutures?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.797
No, no, no. VIP.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.966
What, he's the reincarnation
of the Dalai Lama or something?

12:12.966 --> 12:15.335
No, no, it's a privacy
issue kind of thing.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.337
Well, he still needs to be
tracked. Give me a name.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.006
Any name.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.307
Darwin.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.176
Darwin what?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.445
Magilla.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.380
Are you gonna need a NICU bed?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.382
No, no, no, 'cause we'll
be transferring him back

12:29.382 --> 12:30.818
to the referring
facility.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.953
It's closer to
where he lives

12:32.953 --> 12:36.289
'cause the mom doesn't drive.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.458
( clears throat )

12:41.361 --> 12:44.064
I'm not doing it.
I don't need the job that bad.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.566
Either way, Haleh's gonna go.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.068
But she's a great nurse.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.437
You've never fired
anyone before.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.972
No.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.174
All right, okay,
it's a new skill.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.109
It needs to be developed.
We'll do it together.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.245
What?
Ah, cheer up
It won't be so bad.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.081
Now, listen, my EMT trainees are
waiting for their 12-lead class.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.216
I'll come
find you after.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.986
( knocking at door )

13:05.986 --> 13:07.054
Hey.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.890
Hey, you left the door open.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.960
All right, so, Doctors,
so what's the status report?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.261
Heart rate's down.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.863
He's on 100-percent
room air.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.097
Took eight ounces PO.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.265
Oh, that's great.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.199
Good little guy.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.267
Good little guy.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.434
All right, let's ship him out

13:21.434 --> 13:22.970
before they put us all
on a psych hold.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.872
Shouldn't we keep him awhile?

13:24.872 --> 13:27.007
Yeah, for observation.
He's
awfully young.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.876
Guys, guys, it's just
a bad viral GE,

13:28.876 --> 13:30.577
that's all.
We should recheck
the cultures.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.379
Yeah, well, I'm sure
the vet can do that.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.447
Well, he's gonna need
another round of antibiotics.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.384
Oh, I thought
you didn't like monkeys.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.886
I never said that.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.954
And anyway, he's not a monkey.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.523
Okay. Now, I don't know if I'm
touched or if I'm nauseous,

13:43.523 --> 13:45.558
but, you know what,
we're done here, so DC the lock

13:45.558 --> 13:47.294
and let's get a move on.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.462
There's a giraffe out there
clogging up triage.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.065
12-year-old crushed
under scaffolding
at a construction site.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.233
PRATT:
What's your name,
little man?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.368
Barry.
Is my pop all right?

13:55.368 --> 13:56.569
PICKMAN:
Chest injury,

13:56.569 --> 13:57.971
respiratory distress,
but vitals stable.

13:57.971 --> 13:58.906
What happened to his father?

13:58.906 --> 14:00.040
Everything fell on me.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.408
Dad had an MI trying
to dig him out.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.642
Ray, that's you.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.177
All right, I'll check
on him, Barry.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.345
PRATT:
Okay, both lungs are up.
Let's go.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.646
Cardiac arrest
during exertion.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.448
All right, down time?
Maybe 12 minutes.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.183
Shocked him three times
with epi and atropine.
Okay.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.484
Hold compressions.

14:11.484 --> 14:15.022
Pulseless v-tach.
Let's go! Let's go!

14:15.022 --> 14:16.356
Okay, kiddo,
deep breath now.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.925
( takes deep breath ):
It hurts.

14:17.925 --> 14:18.992
Little bit of stridor here.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.127
INEZ:
Pulse ox 92.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.062
Chest, c-spine, pelvis, CBC.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.363
PICKMAN
You hang in there, Bar.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.564
Thank you, ma'am.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.432
MORRIS:
Chem 7, UA, type and screen.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.934
500cc saline bolus.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.069
Okay, Simon says
squeeze my fingers, pal.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.537
Good, man.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.005
Now wiggle those toes for me.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.206
PRATT:
I'll be right back.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.342
Oh, I didn't say "Simon says."

14:35.342 --> 14:36.643
Shock again at 360.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.611
( zap, beeping )
Sinus rhythm.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.348
I got a pulse.
Let's check a BP.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.583
Man, it's hard to keep track
of the Splenda in here.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.518
Pupils sluggish
but reactive.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.087
All right, folks, let's hope
for some neurological function.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.521
( cell phone rings )
God....

14:48.521 --> 14:49.589
( phone clicks off )
What, no response?

14:49.589 --> 14:52.492
No.
BP's 100 over 70.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.661
His GCS is only 3, fellas.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.463
Fellas, if we save the heart
and lose the brain,

14:56.463 --> 14:57.965
we might as well go home, huh?

14:57.965 --> 14:59.632
Worsening respiratory distress
in here.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.334
PRATT:
Okay, I'm coming.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.335
BARRY:
Pop!

15:02.335 --> 15:04.071
Come on.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.505
We need to paralyze
and intubate,

15:05.505 --> 15:06.439
six-and-a-half ET tube.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.975
Yeah, hold on.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.009
BARRY:
Is he okay?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.177
He will be.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.344
Why's he so stridorous?

15:11.344 --> 15:13.046
Uh... laryngeal injury?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.682
No neck injury,
no midline shift.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.384
Okay, get me some
lido and a tower clip.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.419
You think
the clavicle's displaced?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.421
I think
it's compressing the trachea.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.489
He needs an airway
right now.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.057
Draw up etomidate
and sux.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.325
Don't push anything yet.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.693
Pratt.
So, Barry,

15:26.693 --> 15:28.695
what's your dad
building?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.197
A dream house.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.698
MORRIS:
Oh, yeah?

15:31.698 --> 15:33.366
It's for my mom.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.302
That sounds nice, buddy.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.570
Okay, buddy, you're gonna
feel a little stick here.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.239
( inhales deeply )

15:39.239 --> 15:40.607
I'm helping.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.409
Pratt, push the etomidate.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.312
Oh, I just gotta get
a good grip.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.581
Okay. So, uh, Barry,

15:48.581 --> 15:49.616
what kind of house is it?

15:49.616 --> 15:50.717
A Craftsman.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.419
( sharp groan )

15:52.419 --> 15:53.753
ROBO-DUBENKO:
Is he all right?

15:53.753 --> 15:56.156
INEZ:
Sats coming up,
pulse is normalizing.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.558
Vitals stable, tenderness
over the lower ribs.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.493
ROBO-DUBENKO:
Get a CT abdomen and chest.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.761
What's next door?

16:01.761 --> 16:04.131
V-tach arrest. We got him back.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.267
Is that a robot doctor?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.436
Oh, yeah.
We're very advanced here.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.703
How's it going?

16:10.703 --> 16:11.704
He's not waking up.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.573
We got ROSC
without RONF.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.142
Come again?

16:15.142 --> 16:17.244
Return of spontaneous
circulation without return

16:17.244 --> 16:19.079
of neurologic function.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.313
The down time was
over ten minutes.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.481
Not good enough for brain cells.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.549
Cath lab?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.117
No, I don't think so.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.085
Look, all he's got is
a little ST depression.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.054
I think ICU.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.721
No, no, not yet.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.224
We're gonna go with a portable
chest and a cardiac echo.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.159
What for?

16:32.159 --> 16:33.426
Oh, a little ditty

16:33.426 --> 16:34.761
I like to call
"induced hypothermia."

16:34.761 --> 16:36.063
Look, I'll be right back.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.732
How you doing?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.102
Me? Uh... I'm okay.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.137
The board's
not too backed up.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.173
You need anything?

16:46.173 --> 16:48.175
Uh... no, I'm good.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.809
I kind of like this new energy.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.511
You mean Eve?

16:51.511 --> 16:54.647
She's tough, but it's gonna
be good for all of us

16:54.647 --> 16:55.648
in the long run.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.517
Yeah, I hope so.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.686
So, this new nurse manager's
working out, huh?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.089
She's a terrorist, Neela.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.226
Zoe.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.394
Hi.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.828
Are you looking for Ray?

17:08.828 --> 17:12.199
Oh, um, no. Actually,
I was hoping you could help me.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.368
Where did you
get this thing?

17:16.368 --> 17:18.405
I stole it from the last place
I worked at.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.339
Hey, but that's
between us, okay?

17:20.339 --> 17:21.840
How cold do you set it?

17:21.840 --> 17:24.144
91 Fahrenheit.
33 degrees centigrade.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.545
Which many consider dangerous.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.347
What, we're decreasing
his metabolism?

17:27.347 --> 17:29.282
Yeah, only six percent
per degree centigrade.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.184
Look, it might get his brain
started again.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.520
What about the effect on oxygen
demand in low-flow regions?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.155
The studies show
a 23-percent improvement

17:35.155 --> 17:36.523
in neurologic outcome.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.226
Yeah, I'm familiar
with the literature.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.229
Okay, okay, that's it. I'm done
arguing with a television set.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.131
It's believed to suppress
radical formation...

17:44.131 --> 17:45.565
Did you just call me
a television set?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.200
That's pretty funny.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.701
This isn't a surgical consult,
my friend.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.403
It's believed to suppress
radical formation...

17:50.403 --> 17:52.539
Look, if you can't get
out of bed and come into work,

17:52.539 --> 17:53.673
then I don't see why we should
have to listen to you.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.442
...slow enzymatic reactions

17:55.442 --> 17:56.709
and inhibit excitatory
neurotransmitters.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.745
It kind of burns when I pee.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.480
It sounds like a
bladder infection.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.249
Oh, I figured.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.750
You can get it
from many things,

18:03.750 --> 18:07.487
like having...
sex... a lot.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.322
Oh, I've been doing that.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.723
Don't I know it.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.525
Look, I hope
you don't mind.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.228
I just didn't want to ask Ray
to do this, you know?

18:15.228 --> 18:17.297
It's... fine.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.532
I'll need a urine sample
and run some tests,

18:19.532 --> 18:21.401
but first, I'll need to
get some information.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.402
Okay.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.670
Name?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.538
Um, Butler, Zoe Butler.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.207
Okay. Address?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.676
1226 Parkington Road.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.644
Okay. Date of birth?

18:33.713 --> 18:39.186
December 12th... 1990.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.453
Sorry?

18:40.453 --> 18:42.222
December 12th.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.391
No, I know, uh...

18:44.391 --> 18:46.626
1990.

18:46.626 --> 18:51.631
1990. So you're... 14 years old?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.200
Almost 15.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.237
( chuckling ):
My birthday's coming up.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.613
When will he wake up?

19:06.613 --> 19:11.318
Soon, we hope.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.753
He cheated.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.824
On a business trip,
with some lady from work.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.592
When my mom found out,

19:19.592 --> 19:21.694
she wouldn't let him come home
for a month.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.330
He lived in a hotel.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.532
You know, parents
make mistakes, too.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.735
He's trying
to make it up to her.

19:28.735 --> 19:32.539
Is that what the
house is for?

19:32.539 --> 19:35.242
He wants everything back
the way it was.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.678
WOMAN:
Barry.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.647
Are you okay?

19:40.647 --> 19:43.483
Yeah, Mom... I'm okay.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.851
He's got some
broken bones

19:44.851 --> 19:46.619
and a small injury
to his liver,

19:46.619 --> 19:48.755
but we don't think
he'll need surgery.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.423
And Paul?

19:52.459 --> 19:55.262
Your... your husband's
had a heart attack.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.797
His brain's been
deprived of oxygen.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.500
We're doing our best
to help wake him up.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.337
Excuse me.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.341
What's the big hurry?

20:08.341 --> 20:10.310
Zoe's here,
she's in Exam Two.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.544
She is?

20:11.544 --> 20:12.879
Yes, she is.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.015
Oh, and I almost forgot,
she's 14 years old.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.684
Shut up.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.420
She was born in 1990, Ray.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.821
What?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.956
That's the decade
immediately preceding

20:23.956 --> 20:26.259
the one that we're in.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.760
Are you for real?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.463
Yes. And in prison math,

20:30.463 --> 20:33.833
I believe 14
equals five-to-ten.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.504
Where is she?
Exam Two.

20:37.504 --> 20:39.939
And here's the
kicker, Jerry Lee--

20:39.939 --> 20:43.610
your prepubescent
penis pal has chlamydia.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.612
I had no idea
she was that young.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.514
Young? She's
still teething,

20:47.514 --> 20:49.816
although, I don't know,
maybe you enjoy that.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.285
She didn't say anything.
How was I supposed to know?

20:52.285 --> 20:54.754
Take her out for coffee,
converse with her a bit,

20:54.754 --> 20:56.823
before you start boffing
and handing out house keys.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.725
I don't card
my dates, okay?

20:58.725 --> 21:01.861
( chuckling ):
Oh, well, maybe it's
time you started.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.363
1990?

21:03.363 --> 21:05.332
It was a very good
year for chlamydia.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.599
Hmm.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.536
Why didn't you tell me?

21:09.536 --> 21:11.804
I just thought it was
a bladder infection

21:11.804 --> 21:13.573
from all the sex we were having.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.907
No. God, not that.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.009
Why didn't you tell me
how old you are?

21:17.009 --> 21:20.747
You never asked.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.815
You said you were
a student.

21:22.815 --> 21:23.950
I am.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.685
In what? Ninth grade?

21:25.685 --> 21:28.521
Eighth.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.791
But I didn't think
you'd like me if you knew.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.060
Well, you know,
you're right.

21:34.060 --> 21:37.830
Because I also don't
like courtrooms and prisons

21:37.830 --> 21:39.732
and men named Hank
who make me their bitch.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.867
What is the big deal?

21:40.867 --> 21:42.435
We like each other.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.703
It's fun.

21:43.703 --> 21:44.904
Wait, who's Hank?

21:44.904 --> 21:46.706
Zoe, I'm going
to give you

21:46.706 --> 21:47.974
a prescription
for doxycycline
for the chlamydia.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.709
And you're going to need
to be tested

21:49.709 --> 21:51.444
for a bunch of other STDs, okay?

21:51.444 --> 21:52.545
Like gonorrhea, syphilis

21:52.545 --> 21:53.580
HIV...

21:53.580 --> 21:55.415
Sure, whatever.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.750
And under the circumstances,
no parental consent is required.

21:57.750 --> 21:58.751
That's good.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.119
Thank you.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.588
Wonder who I got it from.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.490
Not me.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.560
Whoa.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.396
How many other
candidates are there?

22:09.396 --> 22:11.464
Were we being monogamous?

22:17.437 --> 22:18.771
He's starting
to shiver.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.540
All right, start
25 of Demerol, IV push.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.574
His wife coming in?

22:21.574 --> 22:22.609
Not just yet.

22:22.609 --> 22:23.610
Sam, ready?

22:23.610 --> 22:24.677
For what?

22:24.677 --> 22:25.745
Haleh's in the family room.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.580
Go ahead, I got this.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.549
I'll push the meds.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.618
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.553
Come on, do not do this.
It's wrong.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.422
You think I find
this enjoyable?

22:35.422 --> 22:36.823
Firing Haleh
is going to send

22:36.823 --> 22:38.691
a message to every
nurse in this joint.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.760
Joint? We're not
in jail, Eve.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.495
No, but it should
feel like we are.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.634
Haleh.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.836
Is something wrong?

22:49.836 --> 22:51.738
Well, we've had quite a few
meetings about your overtime,

22:51.738 --> 22:53.640
right, Haleh?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.007
Uh-huh.
And I've discussed

22:55.007 --> 22:57.109
those meetings with Sam.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.978
Right, Sam?

22:58.978 --> 23:00.713
Yeah, I guess.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.920
Haleh, uh...

23:07.920 --> 23:10.189
you are a wonderful nurse,

23:10.189 --> 23:13.626
and, um...

23:13.626 --> 23:16.463
I'm sure you're going
to continue to do great work,

23:16.463 --> 23:18.498
but...

23:18.498 --> 23:21.501
It's going to have to be
at some other hospital.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.035
Excuse me?

23:24.971 --> 23:27.840
It's just that you've
been warned three times

23:27.840 --> 23:29.909
and, uh...

23:29.909 --> 23:31.878
We're going to have
to let you go.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.548
You're not serious.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.051
Is she serious?

23:40.787 --> 23:43.089
You can report
to HR tomorrow.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.124
You can't do this.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.126
Where you'll turn in your badge
and collect your last paycheck.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.096
Sam.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.635
Haleh, I'm so sorry.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.121
Just getting out?

24:15.121 --> 24:16.589
Yeah.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.924
I read some
magazines.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.559
I never realized
the human esophagus

24:19.559 --> 24:21.227
could be
so complex.

24:21.227 --> 24:25.932
Look, man, you know,
I'm sorry about all this.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.834
But you've got to understand
that it's like this

24:27.834 --> 24:29.902
because of the choices
that Charlie made.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.704
It's not on me.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.641
Dad's a hard guy to figure.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.909
I think maybe some
stuff happened

24:36.909 --> 24:40.179
that he never talked about.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.048
Maybe so.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.584
I think there's some stuff
you don't know too, Greg.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.919
Some stuff that...

24:46.919 --> 24:50.256
maybe your mom didn't
tell you the truth about.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.925
Is that what he told you?

24:52.925 --> 24:53.960
Yeah.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.197
Radiology faxed down
these results.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.199
I just got here, Frank.
What patient?

25:00.199 --> 25:01.734
It's me, actually.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.273
I had a mammogram
last week.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.641
It's normal.

25:08.641 --> 25:09.942
Oh.
Hey, congratulations.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.844
Dr. Clemente, I'm out of here.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.646
The kid in one is stable.
You watching the dad?

25:13.646 --> 25:15.582
Yeah, I'm on the case.

25:15.582 --> 25:19.085
Frank, will you forward
anything for me to my house?

25:19.085 --> 25:21.253
Of course.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.989
We're all really
sorry, Haleh.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.857
Thanks.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.060
I'll try to come by
for a visit...

25:28.060 --> 25:29.896
when I'm up to it.

25:29.896 --> 25:30.797
Take care.

25:30.797 --> 25:31.964
Bye, Haleh.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.271
What?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.707
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.041
What happened?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.242
Sam fired Haleh.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.911
Screw you, Frank.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.078
Eve fired her.
I just...

25:46.078 --> 25:47.647
Helped?

25:47.647 --> 25:49.749
I'm sorry. That's
the word on the street.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.020
Eve's making a statement?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.255
And all the words
are dirty.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.289
Lockhart.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.290
Abby.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.325
Code banana.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.960
Our VIP's bouncing back.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.166
Haleh.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.869
Wait.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.040
Haleh, I feel terrible
about this.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.142
Who covered for you
all those times

26:16.142 --> 26:17.877
your kid was in trouble?

26:17.877 --> 26:19.211
How many shifts
were you late

26:19.211 --> 26:20.947
or had to leave early?

26:20.947 --> 26:24.751
And now you're going
to fire me for too
much overtime?

26:24.751 --> 26:26.953
For what, Sam?

26:26.953 --> 26:29.188
A couple extra hundred
bucks a month.

26:42.268 --> 26:46.072
You calling
her a liar?

26:48.741 --> 26:49.942
I don't know who you mean.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.010
My mother.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.411
Isn't that what you said?

26:52.411 --> 26:53.780
Slow down, son...

26:53.780 --> 26:55.081
Don't you ever call me that.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.216
Ever.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.118
You want to talk about
why you're upset?

26:59.118 --> 27:01.353
I'm not one of those
little Ceasefire punks

27:01.353 --> 27:03.189
you've got convinced
that you have wisdom.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.224
Don't forget,
I know you.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.760
You're not a lesson
or a role model
for anybody, Charlie.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.061
You don't know
everything that happened.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.030
How it all went down
when you were little.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.398
I don't want to talk about it.

27:12.398 --> 27:15.367
Then why the hell you here?

27:15.367 --> 27:17.704
You've already lost one son.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.438
Don't make the same
mistake with Chaz.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.940
You come to give me advice?

27:20.940 --> 27:23.142
Don't bring him into this, okay?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.344
Don't talk to him about it.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.913
He asked. He needed to know.

27:26.913 --> 27:27.914
Know what?

27:27.914 --> 27:30.282
Know what? How you spin it?

27:30.282 --> 27:32.184
Some nonsense
about a dead woman

27:32.184 --> 27:33.953
who happens to be my mother?

27:33.953 --> 27:36.022
She wasted her life away
taking care of me

27:36.022 --> 27:38.157
with no help from you-- nothing.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.360
I tried to come back.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.197
She wouldn't let me.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.799
Look...

27:46.799 --> 27:49.736
I can see we've both had
rough days.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.137
Let's not do
this tonight.

27:51.137 --> 27:54.073
Don't turn
away from me.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.079
You can come by the house
some other time.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.047
There's something
of your mother's

28:01.047 --> 28:02.214
I think you should have.

28:02.214 --> 28:05.317
You've got something of hers?

28:05.317 --> 28:09.756
It belongs to me and her.

28:09.756 --> 28:12.058
Maybe it belongs
with you now.

28:12.058 --> 28:16.495
Whatever it is, I want it.

28:16.495 --> 28:19.231
You hear what I said--
you can come by the house...

28:19.231 --> 28:21.901
Right now!

28:21.901 --> 28:23.770
Right now.

28:30.509 --> 28:31.944
He started breathing hard again,

28:31.944 --> 28:33.179
so I brought him
right back here.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.814
I thought you said
he was okay.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.215
He was, Alonzo, he was.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.984
He looked great
after the bolus.

28:37.984 --> 28:41.353
He was drinking
and playing.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.089
Bag him.
He's not moving air.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.957
Maybe you should have
kept him here longer.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.894
No. No, he seemed
buffed after the fluid.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.461
We thought it was
just dehydration.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.097
I promised Cookie's owners
he'd be okay.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.398
Who's Cookie?

28:52.398 --> 28:54.266
Darwin's mom.

28:54.266 --> 28:55.868
She belongs to this
super nice couple
from Evanstan.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.904
I also keep their llama.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.839
BP's 66/25.

28:59.839 --> 29:00.940
CLEMENTE:
He's gone hypertensive

29:00.940 --> 29:01.874
with a widened pulse pressure.

29:01.874 --> 29:02.842
Sepsis.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.476
Dopamine at ten mics.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.980
He's, um... he's got a bacterial
infection in his blood.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.816
But you gave antibiotics.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.317
Which ruptured
the bacteria,

29:11.317 --> 29:13.219
releasing endotoxins
which can make things worse.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.186
Suction.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.888
I'm so sorry, man.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.890
I thought he was doing
too well to be septic.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.893
Suction.

29:20.893 --> 29:24.130
Okay, tube.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.531
PVC's.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.867
Maybe you can put him
on a vent or something.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.535
We're doing
the best we can.

29:29.535 --> 29:33.005
Okay, I'm in.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.173
My God, I lost the pulse.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.374
V-tac.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.843
Please don't stop.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.845
These people really
love this little guy.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.282
I think we
should call it.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.851
Charge it ten joules.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.085
Starting CPR.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.867
Don't you want
to come in?

30:00.867 --> 30:02.101
No.

30:06.839 --> 30:10.476
You don't have your keys?

30:10.476 --> 30:12.078
Hey.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.445
Chaz, you okay?

30:13.445 --> 30:16.015
Yeah, Dad.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.050
I've got to get
something for your...

30:20.219 --> 30:21.420
for Greg.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.526
Hey, what's up, man?

30:27.526 --> 30:30.596
What's up, man?

30:30.596 --> 30:32.498
I just went to go talk to him.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.134
Because of me?

30:35.134 --> 30:38.304
It's fine.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.072
Why don't you come in?

30:40.072 --> 30:42.074
Nah, I, uh...

30:42.074 --> 30:44.043
EVELYN:
Chaz, dinner's on the table.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.945
My mom's mac and cheese.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.479
I swear to God,

30:47.479 --> 30:50.349
it's the best you ever
tasted in your life.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.418
Come on, man.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.327
Hey.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.931
I'm sorry.

31:04.931 --> 31:08.935
Why, because I talked myself
into liking some groupie

31:08.935 --> 31:12.171
who turned out to be
Hillary Duff with an STD?

31:12.171 --> 31:13.940
I know you liked her.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.207
I'm an idiot.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.109
The bright side is,
your urine dip came back

31:17.109 --> 31:18.978
negative for chlamydia.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.547
Oh, well, she must
have gotten it

31:21.547 --> 31:23.649
from another rock star
she was partying with.

31:23.649 --> 31:28.020
Probably one with
a recording deal.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.222
I should probably
still swab you.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.225
I used a condom, Neela.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.961
Did you also use
a dental dam?

31:48.607 --> 31:50.409
Neela, your top secret baby
is back.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.577
Abby needs you in sutures.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.145
Okay.

31:55.314 --> 31:56.682
CLEMENTE:
Going again.
Clear!

31:58.717 --> 32:00.486
Still v-tach.
RASGOTRA:
What happened?

32:00.486 --> 32:02.388
I don't know.
Just resuming
compressions.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.223
Septic shock.
How long since
the last epi?

32:04.223 --> 32:05.591
Two minutes. You want
another round of lido?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.659
( sighs ):
No.

32:07.659 --> 32:08.660
Are you sure you don't
want another round?

32:08.660 --> 32:09.996
Yeah, no, he's been...

32:09.996 --> 32:11.363
We been doing this
for 35 minutes.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.599
His brain's got
to be fried.
No, keep going.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.701
He's been through enough.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.536
I-I... we got to stop.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.071
His heart's still beating.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.173
That's more like a twitch.

32:21.173 --> 32:24.010
It's not actually pumping
any blood to his body.

32:25.344 --> 32:26.678
S-So, that's it?

32:30.016 --> 32:32.251
Just about.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.685
He's fading.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.026
Can I go get Cookie?

32:40.026 --> 32:41.460
I'm sorry?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.029
His mother.

32:43.029 --> 32:46.265
If he's dying,
she should be here with him.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.567
Her baby was taken from her.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.469
She needs to understand why.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.670
Anybody says "next of kin,"
I'm gonna lose it.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.605
I think you've
already lost it.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.242
Why? Because I tried to help
a guy and it didn't work out?

32:56.242 --> 32:57.676
Just game over,
that's all.
We're in it this far.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.378
Why not let the mother in?

32:59.378 --> 33:01.147
Because there's no need.
That's why.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.614
Well, there was no need
to treat a chimp

33:02.614 --> 33:04.183
in the first place,
but here we are.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.517
The chimp was sick.
The mom is what?

33:05.517 --> 33:07.053
She's a little depressed, maybe?

33:07.053 --> 33:09.355
Well, it's the humane thing
to do.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.689
Okay, forget it, guys.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.091
You guys are getting
carried away with this.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.759
Oh, come on.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.695
You're the one that started
this whole monkey business.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.797
( whispers ):
I didn't mean to say that.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.532
Thank You, Lord,
for the blessings

33:20.532 --> 33:22.301
we are about to receive.

33:22.301 --> 33:24.770
Look over those now
who cannot be with us,

33:24.770 --> 33:27.373
including the countrymen
who fight to protect us

33:27.373 --> 33:28.774
in an overseas war

33:28.774 --> 33:32.311
founded on lies told to us
by our government...

33:32.311 --> 33:33.579
Jocelyn?

33:33.579 --> 33:36.448
...and we welcome Greg,
and thank You, Lord,

33:36.448 --> 33:39.685
for bringing him into
our home and family.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.153
Amen.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.089
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.

33:45.624 --> 33:49.761
So, why do you have
that walker, if you
don't mind me asking?

33:49.761 --> 33:51.597
Had a little fall,
broke my hip.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.232
Little?
I was so scared

33:53.232 --> 33:55.267
when I found her,
I thought she was dead.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.169
She was laying there...
( imitates gasping )

33:57.169 --> 33:59.405
( laughing )

33:59.405 --> 34:01.673
I still have a ways to go
with my recovery.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.375
And where'd you get
your surgery?

34:03.375 --> 34:04.810
County.

34:07.713 --> 34:08.647
( sighs )

34:08.647 --> 34:11.550
Must be downstairs.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.120
It'll only take a minute.

34:21.592 --> 34:24.496
Um... excuse me for a minute.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.777
Why didn't you tell me
about Evelyn?

34:39.777 --> 34:42.313
That she was the one
at County that day?

34:42.313 --> 34:44.416
You know, maybe
I could have helped.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.784
You didn't seem in
the mood for helping.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.389
Here.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.161
A bunch of things
I sent your mother

34:56.161 --> 34:58.664
that she sent back.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.367
A few notes she
wrote me, and...

35:01.367 --> 35:04.403
and...

35:04.403 --> 35:05.771
this.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.178
An act of mercy--

35:12.178 --> 35:14.280
her sending me
that picture.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.650
I don't even remember
when this was taken.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.421
I made mistakes, Greg.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.924
I never denied it.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.494
Got busted for some
stupid, petty stuff

35:28.494 --> 35:30.629
and went away for awhile.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.831
Regretted it
ever since.

35:35.867 --> 35:39.438
But life is more complicated
than you think.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.678
RASGOTRA:
No respiratory effect.

35:46.678 --> 35:49.215
( monitor beeping slows )

35:49.215 --> 35:51.217
Yeah, well, it
won't be long now.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.884
ALONZO:
Is he in pain?

35:52.884 --> 35:54.220
No.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.788
( sighs )

36:00.826 --> 36:02.728
I'm gonna give him another
milligram of morphine,

36:02.728 --> 36:06.432
just in case.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.634
What? I just want to make
sure he's comfortable.

36:08.634 --> 36:09.635
( sighs )

36:21.480 --> 36:22.481
Okay, I'm sorry.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.450
No, no, let go.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.788
( Cookie moaning )

36:36.928 --> 36:38.930
( whispers ):
Thanks.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.530
( sighs ):
GCS is up from four to 11.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.899
He's blinking on command.
Starting to move his fingers.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.702
See? Sometimes you're good
and then sometimes you're lucky.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.036
Which one is this?

37:18.036 --> 37:19.871
This is sometimes
you're not sure.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.340
( both chuckling )

37:21.340 --> 37:22.641
MORRIS:
We're waiting on ICU.

37:22.641 --> 37:23.909
CLEMENTE:
Good, good.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.844
Hey, why don't you go
bring his kid in?

37:25.844 --> 37:27.646
Yeah.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.981
Hi.

37:29.981 --> 37:33.719
You know, patients
come and go.

37:33.719 --> 37:37.656
And, uh, some days, some of
them don't even register to me.

37:37.656 --> 37:40.426
So how is it that a
hairy little chimp

37:40.426 --> 37:44.330
crumps on the table
and it's like...

37:46.765 --> 37:49.000
Well, in any case it sounds
like you'll forgive me.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.470
For what?
Well...

37:51.470 --> 37:54.873
there's gonna be
some kind of disciplinary...

37:54.873 --> 37:56.508
suspension.

37:56.508 --> 37:57.776
( chuckles )

37:57.776 --> 37:58.810
What, did Eve find out?

37:58.810 --> 38:00.379
She's not an animal lover.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.414
More like an animal
strangler, I'm guessing.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.350
You know, it's funny,
'cause when I was a kid,

38:04.350 --> 38:05.884
I-I always wanted a robot
and a monkey.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.819
That doesn't shock me.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.555
No, no, I'm serious.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.022
Me, too.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.791
Well, I'm over it.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.526
( chuckles )

38:18.864 --> 38:20.366
CLEMENTE:
Spontaneous eye movement--

38:20.366 --> 38:22.501
that's a very good sign,
Lockhart.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.035
My name's Abby.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.404
Yeah, I know.

38:31.577 --> 38:34.012
( cell phone rings )

38:36.047 --> 38:40.386
Jodi, Jodi, if you call me
one more time, I swear to God...

38:40.386 --> 38:43.555
No, you just got to stop
that nonsense.

38:43.555 --> 38:44.923
No, I'm not in New York.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.692
Why would I tell you
where I'm at?

38:46.692 --> 38:48.927
Yeah, why-why would I tell you?

38:48.927 --> 38:50.829
Yeah, because you're...

38:50.829 --> 38:53.064
Every time tha...

38:53.064 --> 38:54.666
You're the... Hey!

38:54.666 --> 38:56.101
Hey! Hey!

38:56.101 --> 38:57.703
( clattering )

38:57.703 --> 39:00.472
( Jodi speaking indistinctly )

39:57.796 --> 40:00.466
( sighs )

40:00.466 --> 40:03.835
Sure are getting good
at finding me.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.170
Yeah.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.440
I talked to Olivia.

40:11.510 --> 40:15.046
This was our house.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.716
I used to play
out here.

40:17.716 --> 40:20.619
She would watch me
from the window.

40:24.490 --> 40:27.893
So, you tried to come back.

40:27.893 --> 40:31.029
She pushed you away.

40:31.029 --> 40:35.200
She lied to you.
She lied to me.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.003
And, no, I didn't know
any of it.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.541
But the question is:

40:42.541 --> 40:44.810
What did you do
to make her hate you so much?

40:47.145 --> 40:50.181
I got into trouble.

40:50.181 --> 40:53.184
Maybe she felt
she was protecting you.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.887
When I got out of the pen,

40:55.887 --> 40:58.056
I wanted us to be a family.

41:00.225 --> 41:03.929
I was still a kid when she died.
What about then?

41:03.929 --> 41:05.531
( sighs )

41:05.531 --> 41:08.634
I was living in Gary
with Evelyn.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.736
I came here to find you.

41:10.736 --> 41:13.539
But they told me
you had gone to Detroit

41:13.539 --> 41:15.073
with your cousin's people.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.844
So you gave up?

41:18.844 --> 41:22.548
( sighs ):
That was the biggest
mistake of all.

41:22.548 --> 41:23.982
But I had a second life

41:23.982 --> 41:27.218
that I was trying
to hold together.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.287
I've done my penance.

41:29.287 --> 41:34.092
I do it every day.

41:34.092 --> 41:39.765
But there's only one person who
I still need forgiveness from.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.007
I hear you.

41:54.245 --> 41:55.647
( sighs )

41:55.647 --> 41:58.584
I hear everything
that you say.

42:05.056 --> 42:07.726
( sighs )

42:07.726 --> 42:12.598
But you and me...
we're here now.

42:12.598 --> 42:15.066
None of that other
stuff matters anymore.

42:15.066 --> 42:18.737
Because even if the
story's more complicated

42:18.737 --> 42:24.610
than the one I spent the
last 20 years believing...

42:24.610 --> 42:27.112
you still were
not there for me.

42:29.114 --> 42:31.817
And I don't give a damn
why or who said what.

42:31.817 --> 42:32.818
Greg?

42:32.818 --> 42:36.021
You were not... here.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.723
Please listen to me.

42:37.723 --> 42:39.958
And we can never change that.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.863
We can fix it.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.935
Never, man.

42:53.004 --> 42:54.806
Never.

42:59.310 --> 43:01.647
( sighs )
