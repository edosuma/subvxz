08:09.050 --> 08:10.180
Everyone has dirt.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.520
-Now, this is just a rumor,

08:11.620 --> 08:13.860
but I heard Ida B. Wells
used to sell pussy.

08:13.960 --> 08:14.990
-Mm.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.990
Your slogan is
"Gayle, Take the Wheel."

08:18.060 --> 08:19.560
But as you can see here,

08:19.660 --> 08:22.360
there's still a lot of voters
that don't trust you.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.030
Why should they?

08:24.130 --> 08:25.630
-I'm sorry.

08:25.700 --> 08:29.070
Dareth, why is your name on
this list of undecided voters?

08:29.170 --> 08:31.910
-I mean, I can
still be persuaded.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.740
Come on. Wow me.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.880

Hello, and welcome

09:11.580 --> 09:14.050
I'm your host,
Dr. Hosneth Dalton.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.420
Today, we are proud to host
the Aldermanic debate

09:17.520 --> 09:19.120
for the 51st Ward,

09:19.220 --> 09:21.690
a ward that's had
its bumps and bruises,

09:21.760 --> 09:24.190
that sometimes
feels cracked and dry.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.590
But these two men right here
are here to apply

09:26.690 --> 09:30.260
some political cocoa butter
on the district's ashy elbows.

09:30.360 --> 09:36.740
Acclaimed hunter, author,
son, and grandson...

09:36.800 --> 09:40.440
America's favorite Aries,
Adam Bethune.

09:40.540 --> 09:41.910
-[ Chuckles ]

09:41.980 --> 09:44.280
Thank you, brother, so much
for that introduction.

09:44.380 --> 09:46.450
And mentioning my --
my grandfather?

09:46.550 --> 09:47.580
Beautiful.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.580
-And our other candidate,
uh, Allen Gayle.

09:49.650 --> 09:52.090
Welcome to the table.
-Okay.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.490
That's my entire introduction?

09:53.590 --> 09:55.620
Did you not get the bio
that we sent over?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.490
Look, I know that we can't all
be Harold Washington's godson

09:58.590 --> 10:01.130
like my friend here,
but, uh, I've done some things.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.160
I've done some things.
-Like?

10:03.260 --> 10:05.500
-I was told there'd be
no live fact-checking.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.340
-Alright, well, thank you both
for joining us.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.100
How about some
opening statements?

10:09.170 --> 10:10.500
-I think I should
actually go first

10:10.610 --> 10:11.970
since you guys are having
your little love fest.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.510
Um...a little -- little dry.

10:13.610 --> 10:14.840
Let me just, uh,
get something to drink here.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.140
-Did you need some water,
perhaps?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.610
-No, maybe I need
some milk because --

10:17.680 --> 10:19.150
Do y'all see this? Huh?

10:19.250 --> 10:20.780
Y'all getting this?
Which camera am I in?

10:20.850 --> 10:22.120
Is it this one? You getting it?

10:22.180 --> 10:23.320
You getting it, huh?

10:23.420 --> 10:24.750
This is because
he's been missing.

10:24.820 --> 10:27.590
He's been missing
from the 51st Ward.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.820
Bethune -- he treats
the community like a side piece.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.990
He's always like,
"Uh, hey, 51st.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.360
Oh, oh, you up?

10:33.460 --> 10:35.860
Oh, you know, I'm just in D.C.
doin' my thing,

10:35.960 --> 10:39.130

you know, for a day."

10:43.200 --> 10:44.340

10:44.440 --> 10:46.140

10:51.280 --> 10:53.610
-We know you.
-But do you know my opponent?

10:53.680 --> 10:56.450
My opponent, Allen Gayle,
is a public defender.

10:56.520 --> 11:00.720
And if Allen Gayle spent
more time defending his clients

11:00.820 --> 11:04.360
instead of making arts
and crafts out of milk cartons,

11:04.460 --> 11:07.290
well, then maybe fewer
of our brothers and sisters

11:07.360 --> 11:08.460
would be locked up,

11:08.530 --> 11:11.470
missing in
the jail system today.

11:11.530 --> 11:13.070
And also, soy milk?

11:13.170 --> 11:14.400
Black people don't drink that.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.470
-Oh, ho, bro, I mean --

11:16.540 --> 11:19.370
Lactose-intolerant
people say "aye."

11:19.470 --> 11:21.340
I heard some.
I heard some people say "aye."

11:23.010 --> 11:24.510
-How do you know if
the penis is worth it?

11:24.580 --> 11:30.220
I mean, it's good, but is it
"ruin my life" good?

11:30.320 --> 11:32.590
Okay, so, this dude
ghosted me, right?

11:32.690 --> 11:34.190
-Mm-hmm.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.220
-And, like, all of a sudden,
he popped back up, acting cute.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.730
So I got two options.
-Mm-hmm.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.090
-Either get back with an ex
who is a fuckboi.

11:40.190 --> 11:41.400
-Fuckboys. Nice. Good choice.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.860
-Or...
-Or?

11:42.930 --> 11:44.430
-...I can just re-up
my hot girl summer solstice

11:44.530 --> 11:46.900

and will forever be life.

-Oh, my God, you're always
championing that.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.400
"Ho is life! Ho is life!"
-It is.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.910
Ho is life.
-"Hey, everybody, ho is life."

11:52.010 --> 11:53.370
Ho is most cert--
-Yeah.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.780
-You know what?
And by the way, I really wish

11:54.880 --> 11:56.240
you would stop saying
around my son.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.280
'Cause he's saying it online
and I-R-L.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.580
-Yes, Josh. Good.
-No, Josh. Bad.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.080
Why don't you just stop dating
these street rascals

12:03.180 --> 12:04.520
and get a good guy?
You know what I'm saying?

12:04.590 --> 12:05.750
-Like you?
-Change it up.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.090
-Ohh.
-Yeah. You could do worse.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.590
Oh, my God.
I got this friend --

Did they ever fix this, uh,
Wi-Fi on this thing?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.270
-I think they did.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.570
-Okay, yeah,
he's on Negro Search.

12:19.630 --> 12:21.370
-Okay, let me see.
-Check this out.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.700

random people?

-What's tough about it?

12:34.650 --> 12:35.780
-Alright, fine, fuck it.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.950
Just call him.
-Yes!

-Do it quick
before I change my mind.

by fire right now?

-Oh, you got Bluetooth
in the helmet.

13:03.510 --> 13:04.810
Okay, you probably can't talk.
-No, no, I can talk.

-Oh, you can talk?
-Yes. Go ahead.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.480

Anyway, I got this -- I'm sorry.

It's really loud. There's a lot
of people screaming.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.290
-20 years today,
Alderman Mathers gave his famous

13:14.360 --> 13:16.490
"I Am Not" speech.

-Mm. Mm.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.660
-Let's take a look.
-Mm.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.530
-You cannot tell me what I am.

13:21.630 --> 13:23.360
You cannot tell me
what I can be.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.100
I know my place in this world,

13:25.170 --> 13:27.170
and I intend to let it
be known to everybody.

13:27.270 --> 13:30.300
I will stand up
to white politicians in power

13:30.370 --> 13:33.010
because I will always be me.

13:33.110 --> 13:35.810
And because I am not your nigga.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.680
And I will never be your nigga.

Lots of N-words there.

13:48.860 --> 13:52.230
Um, Adam, how do you respond?

13:52.330 --> 13:54.800
Is that speech still relevant?

13:54.860 --> 13:56.030
-Nigga, yes.

13:56.130 --> 13:59.970
Al Mathers remains
a inspired mentor to me,

14:00.030 --> 14:02.370
a person who pushed me
into politics,

14:02.470 --> 14:04.640
and I love
what he stood for there.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.880
And it's what I hope to stand
for in the city of Chicago now.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.480
-Great insight, Adam.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.580
Um, Allen, what do those words

14:12.680 --> 14:15.250
of Alderman Mathers'
mean to you?

14:15.350 --> 14:17.220
-Powerful. Powerful.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.550
We need to lift this word up.
We claimed it now.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.590
We should make it
the new crypto.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.760
"Nigga" as a crypto.
-I'm sorry.

14:24.860 --> 14:28.930
You're hoping to invest
and get other people to invest?

14:29.030 --> 14:31.330
-I'm just saying, brother --
-Buying and selling...

14:31.400 --> 14:33.230
-It's -- It's --
-...niggas.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.570
-You're gonna monetize
that word?

14:35.670 --> 14:37.270
-As a coin.

14:37.370 --> 14:38.910
-I'm just saying
there's value in niggas.

14:39.010 --> 14:41.340
-By reintroducing slavery
as a concept.

your ass is gonna end up broke.

-Mr. Gayle, when you were at
"Bough-den,"

15:26.650 --> 15:28.960
the black student union
held a sit-in

15:29.060 --> 15:31.890
that blocked a classroom
where you had classes.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
At the time, you wrote
an article called

How Communication Can Help Us
All Get Back to Class."

Can you expand
on what that was about?

on the pronunciation

You know, I grew up, you know,
in Englewood, had --

15:48.280 --> 15:49.780
had to overcome some stuff.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.150
I had to look out
on those streets sometimes

15:51.250 --> 15:53.080
and be like, "Mm, not tonight."

15:53.150 --> 15:54.950
But, you know, when it came time

-I understand.

15:59.850 --> 16:01.460
-That's -- That's how
I'm coming, you know, 51st.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.660
-So --
-I went to their schools

16:02.760 --> 16:04.260
to pick up
some of their knowledge,

16:04.330 --> 16:09.000
study from their teachers,
you know, the tricknology.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.170
And then I came back here,
and I was like, "Ay, brothers."

16:11.270 --> 16:12.700
You know, I used to be
a Five Percenter, too.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.500
I used to be like,
"Peace to the Gods of the Earth.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.000
Here's 120, and here's
what else I've learned."

16:16.100 --> 16:17.470
-I understand.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.670
Some people would say
that's getting in to fitting in.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.040
So, is that, uh, selling out
in any form or fashion?

16:23.140 --> 16:24.780
-Well, I don't rap, okay?
So I don't, you know --

16:24.850 --> 16:27.720
Stuff starts rhyming, and I --
I get a little suspicious.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.680
-Mr. Bethune, what are
the many reasons that make you

16:30.780 --> 16:33.520
the most qualified candidate
for this job?

16:33.620 --> 16:36.220
-For years,
the 51st has been represented

16:36.320 --> 16:39.060
by people with good intentions.

16:39.160 --> 16:43.560
But right now,
what the 51st needs is a boss.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.130
I am the biggest boss thus far,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.670
and, yes, Rick Ross gave me
permission to say that.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.870
I'm --
-He did?

16:48.970 --> 16:50.340
-He did.
-Major achievement.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.040
-He absolutely did,
and you know what else is major?

16:52.140 --> 16:53.670
-What?
-Me.

16:53.740 --> 16:57.380
If I hang out with a lady,
it's First Lady Michelle Obama.

16:57.480 --> 16:58.810
No disrespect to Barry.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.810
I go glasses shopping
with Oprah.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.050
-Mm.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.680
-I bought Michael Jordan
his first skinny suit.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.090
Now, he ain't worn it yet,
but it's coming.

17:06.190 --> 17:09.220
I'm a Chicon.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.230
The 51st doesn't need
an alderman

17:11.330 --> 17:13.260
who's a part of the system.

17:13.360 --> 17:17.560
The 51st needs an alderman who
is a partner with the system.

17:17.660 --> 17:20.770
Ladies, I am that partner.

17:20.870 --> 17:24.200
Gentlemen,
y'all can be there, too.

17:24.270 --> 17:27.040
Thank you for your time,
and thank for your vote.

17:27.110 --> 17:28.240
-Well said, Adam.

17:28.340 --> 17:31.210
Um, and, Mr. Gayle,
same question.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.580
-You know what?

17:32.680 --> 17:34.780
Forget anything I prepared
in advance, alright?

17:34.880 --> 17:37.420
Let me just speak from my heart.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.690
Let's say you have a leak
in your basement,

17:39.750 --> 17:41.590
and it's leaking into a bucket.

17:41.690 --> 17:43.020
-Now he's speaking my language.

17:43.090 --> 17:45.260
-Then once in a while,
you change the bucket.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.760
Problem solved, right?

17:46.860 --> 17:48.260
No, it's not solved.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.600
And that's all
I'm trying to say here.

17:49.700 --> 17:50.860
This man is an empty bucket.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.370
He wants you to believe

17:52.430 --> 17:55.300
that the system is gonna award
our community justice.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.970
No. No. Fix the leak.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.440
We have let a flood build up.
-That was good.

17:59.540 --> 18:02.040
We got this.
-Bethune doesn't give a damn.

18:02.110 --> 18:05.110
Well, I am here to build a dam.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.710
-Not bad.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.750
I'm gonna give it to you.

18:09.820 --> 18:11.820
-Wait, are you --
are you giving out points?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.790
-Yes, I am.

18:13.890 --> 18:16.260
-"And in a whisper
of golden light,

18:16.320 --> 18:18.890
you bring everything I am
back to life.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.260
My once quiet heartbeat
back in refrain,

18:22.330 --> 18:27.330
and I pause for them draws --
Endgame."

18:27.430 --> 18:29.600
-Yeah, yeah.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.840
You know, I really enjoyed
when you talked about

18:31.940 --> 18:34.810
the moonlight
splashing into her eyes.

18:34.910 --> 18:38.410
But I gotta say, describing eyes
is a bit tired

18:38.480 --> 18:39.980
and a road well-trod.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.320
But consider this --
talk about the moonlight

18:42.420 --> 18:45.850
splashing in the puddle
at her feet.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.290
Yeah, see?

18:47.350 --> 18:48.620
It shows that her presence
brings newness

18:48.690 --> 18:50.360
to everything around her, see?

18:50.460 --> 18:52.290
Know what I'm saying?

18:52.360 --> 18:54.430
The fuck you doing,
little nigga?!

18:54.500 --> 18:55.960
Huh?! Breathing?!

18:56.030 --> 18:57.830
And tuck your fucking chain in,
boy.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.830
You better tuck
your motherfucking chain in.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.610
Ay, man,
bring your chain out, dawg.

19:05.670 --> 19:07.540
Bring your chain out.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.440
Oh-ho-ho! You a king, brother.

19:10.510 --> 19:13.450
-Warden, he is not being scared.
He is being encouraged.

19:13.510 --> 19:16.650
-These dudes don't do nothing
all day but work out and write.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.050
You know I almost
let Tariq out last week?

19:18.150 --> 19:19.690
-Yeah, see that?

19:19.790 --> 19:23.020
-He wrote me a beautiful letter
on the effervescence of freedom.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.560
-One of the things
plaguing the 51st Ward

19:27.660 --> 19:30.060
is gang violence in schools.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.730
What do you two plan
to do about that?

19:31.830 --> 19:34.070
-You know, I have spent
a tremendous amount

19:34.170 --> 19:35.540
of time with gang youth.

19:35.640 --> 19:39.210
And it breaks my heart to think
that the degree

19:39.310 --> 19:41.210
to which you turn your hat

19:41.310 --> 19:44.810
might determine whether you live
long enough to get a degree.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.550
-I think we have to
try something new.

19:46.650 --> 19:49.720
Now, this answer isn't polite,
but let's reorganize

19:49.820 --> 19:52.920
the school system
according to gang affiliation.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.350
No, seriously.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.390
Give the Slashos
their own school.

19:56.490 --> 19:58.060
Like, Slasho science.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.330
Slasho home ec.

19:59.390 --> 20:00.660
Slasho quiz bowl.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.160
Trust me, St. Ignatius.

20:02.230 --> 20:04.060
Let them win the quiz bowl
this year.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.230

that will bring our students

20:07.330 --> 20:09.570

you're trying to say?

20:14.370 --> 20:17.110
It's pronounced "lit-er-acy."
-Little tongue tied.

20:17.210 --> 20:20.510
-I'm sure you are, but that's
how that's pronounced.

20:20.580 --> 20:21.880
-Okay.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.420
-But, seriously, special
education is no laughing matter,

20:24.520 --> 20:26.020

everything I can

20:26.090 --> 20:27.550

20:27.620 --> 20:30.290

bring up education, Adam,

20:30.390 --> 20:33.590

a year late from Yale

20:33.690 --> 20:35.800
