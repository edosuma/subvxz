and books he reads?

Mr. grundy's drinking habits?

But I tell you, Mr. Bradford,
like I said before,

09:27.899 --> 09:29.867
we only bump into each other
now and then.

09:29.934 --> 09:32.936

That man is from the
f.B.I., ain't he?

10:04.102 --> 10:08.105
He didn't say
he was from the f.B.I.
He's a government investigator.

right out and says,

shoot somebody, Edith.

bother with that stuff.

doesn't mean he did anything.

11:34.893 --> 11:37.395
That's crazy.
First Mr. grundy
and now you?

11:37.462 --> 11:40.364
Grundy. That's it.
He's up to his neck
in something.

11:40.432 --> 11:43.668
- They know I'm his best buddy.
They think I'm in it with him.
- In what?

11:43.735 --> 11:46.937
Whatever it is
he's in, meathead!
How the hell do I know?

11:47.005 --> 11:50.007
Daddy, I think
you're getting uptight
over nothing.

11:50.074 --> 11:52.176
What do you mean, "nothing"?
You call that nothing?

11:52.243 --> 11:54.945
Investigators going
around the neighborhood
asking neighbors about you.

11:55.013 --> 11:57.515
You should have heard
mcnab on the phone there.
Nervous.

11:57.582 --> 12:01.185
That dumb Mick,
he's so scared,
he'll tell them anything.

12:01.252 --> 12:03.887
Wait till they get
to old man bellini.
Oh, bellini.

12:03.955 --> 12:06.557
Why did I have to call
that dago a dago?

12:08.327 --> 12:11.362
Archie, how can
your friends hurt you?

12:11.430 --> 12:13.364
By spilling
everything they know.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.266
But there ain't
nothing to spill.
You ain't done nothing.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.669
It's only my word
against the f.B.I.'S.

12:18.737 --> 12:22.039
So? The f.B.I. Can't
do nothing to you.

12:22.106 --> 12:24.942
How do you know that?
'Cause you're innocent.

12:25.009 --> 12:27.945
But of what, Edith?
Of what?

12:34.653 --> 12:37.455
Archie, aren't you gonna
eat your dinner?

12:37.522 --> 12:39.690
I ain't got no appetite.
Forget about dinner.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.861
Can I have your portion,
arch?

12:50.201 --> 12:52.803
You know, I think you'd eat
through a tidal wave.

12:54.639 --> 12:57.975
Lionel said he was
coming over here.
What's keeping him?

12:58.042 --> 13:01.044
He said he'd run over
as soon as the investigator
left his house.

13:01.112 --> 13:04.047
Oh, geez.
If that ain't mortifying.

13:04.115 --> 13:06.617
The government checking me out
with the coloreds.

13:09.053 --> 13:11.655
I don't know what
you're so worried about, arch.

13:11.723 --> 13:14.157
Investigation has become
the new American way of life.

13:14.225 --> 13:16.627
Everybody's doing it--
the army, the Navy,
the senate.

13:16.695 --> 13:19.397
Banks and businesses--
every little
credit bureau investigates.

13:19.464 --> 13:22.332
Hire a hall, will ya?

13:22.401 --> 13:24.702
This ain't no little
credit bureau of investigation.

13:24.770 --> 13:27.371
This is the federal bureau
of investigation.

13:27.439 --> 13:31.742
Are they still out there?
<i>Sure they are, Edith.</i>
<i>Look out there.</i>

13:31.810 --> 13:35.145
I don't see nobody.
Of course you don't, Edith.

13:35.213 --> 13:38.215
Them f.B.I. Guys are experts
at keeping themselves hid.

13:38.283 --> 13:41.685
Then how do you know
they're watching?

13:41.753 --> 13:44.655
Edith,
when they ain't watching,
you can see 'em,

13:44.723 --> 13:47.892
and when you can't see 'em,
they're watching.

13:47.959 --> 13:51.462
- You see?
- Oh.

13:52.597 --> 13:55.365
Them f.B.I. Guys
are damn tricky.

13:55.434 --> 13:59.904
You don't really believe
the f.B.I. Has you under
constant surveillance, do you?

13:59.971 --> 14:03.841
Sure he does, Gloria.
Why else would he put the flag
out front at 8:00 at night?

14:11.583 --> 14:15.185
Because I love the flag.

14:15.253 --> 14:18.689
Sure you do, arch.
It's useful too. That way
you can spot the f.B.I. Guys...

14:18.757 --> 14:21.559
When they come out
of the bushes to salute.

14:23.895 --> 14:28.031
You better keep filling
your face. You're eating
for two, you know.

14:30.368 --> 14:33.437
Edith, you see that empty house
next to rizzo's there?

14:33.505 --> 14:35.573
Yeah.
You see the open window?

14:35.640 --> 14:37.608
Was that window open
yesterday?

14:37.676 --> 14:40.410
Archie, I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.980
Edith, they put guys
into houses like that...

14:43.047 --> 14:46.851
To watch 24 hours a day
through high-powered
"spectaculars."

14:48.720 --> 14:51.689
Hey, that's right,
arch. Yeah.

14:51.756 --> 14:53.891
I hear they've got
listening devices too.

14:53.959 --> 14:57.127
Be very careful what you say.
They've probably
got the house bugged.

14:57.195 --> 15:00.197
They could have the-- no!
What are you talking about?

15:00.264 --> 15:02.600
They couldn't do that
without nobody knowing!

15:02.667 --> 15:05.035
What do you say
a stupid thing
like that for anyhow?

15:05.103 --> 15:08.105
Letting your imagination
go crazy, talking about bugs.

15:08.172 --> 15:10.340
There ain't
no such thing around.

15:13.111 --> 15:15.546
Did you lose something,
Archie?

15:15.614 --> 15:19.517
- I didn't lose nothing, Edith!
- No, he's just looking
for bugs.

15:19.584 --> 15:22.085
Bugs? There ain't no bugs
in this house.

15:22.153 --> 15:26.189
I spread the roach paste
around last week.

15:29.494 --> 15:31.996
Why are you torturing me?

15:32.063 --> 15:36.333
No, ma, I'm talking about
microphones. The f.B.I. Can
plant those things anyplace.

15:36.401 --> 15:39.503
Keep your voice down.
Let's not get nobody
sore at us, huh?

15:39.571 --> 15:41.805
<i>Oh, I think it's too late</i>
<i>for that, arch.</i>

15:41.873 --> 15:45.676
If Bradford planted a bug,
they've heard everything
you've said since then.

15:45.744 --> 15:48.311
I ain't said nothin'
since then.
Well, I don't know.

15:48.379 --> 15:52.115
You said the f.B.I.'S tricky.
That could be very damaging.
Shh!

15:52.183 --> 15:56.219
I ain't never been nothing
but a patriotic citizen
as long as I've been alive.

15:56.287 --> 16:01.124
[ Loudly ]
I've been a number one loyal fan
of j. Edgar hoover,

16:01.192 --> 16:03.060
the greatest commie catcher
of them all,

16:03.127 --> 16:05.429
and remember where
youse all heard that.

16:05.496 --> 16:09.533
From Archie bunker,
704 hauser street,
veteran of the big war.

16:16.575 --> 16:20.044
Why was you talking
into the camel, Archie?

16:21.713 --> 16:24.848
Keep your voice down.

16:24.916 --> 16:28.185
[ Whispering ]
Why was you talking
into the camel?

16:28.252 --> 16:31.188
[ Yelling ]
Keep your voice down!
Geez--

16:31.255 --> 16:33.924
they can plant microphones
anywhere.

16:33.992 --> 16:36.927
They got microphones as small
as an olive or a raisin.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.563
Hey, arch!
Look at this!
Huh?

16:39.631 --> 16:43.533
That looks like a button.
It is. I just tore it
off my sleeve.

16:44.736 --> 16:46.904
Are you trying to make
a monkey out of me?

16:46.972 --> 16:51.742
You're doing it to yourself,
acting scared and guilty,
worrying about microphones.

16:51.810 --> 16:55.079
The f.B.I. Is investigating
your father. The bell.
[ Doorbell ringing ]

16:55.146 --> 16:57.347
<i>That's the door.</i>
<i>Edith, wait a minute.</i>

16:57.415 --> 16:59.416
It might be another one
of them g-men, see?

16:59.484 --> 17:02.119
So don't say anything
until you're sure
who it is.

17:02.186 --> 17:05.155
These guys can disguise
themselves as anything.
Go ahead. I'll be up here.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.156
All right.

17:07.224 --> 17:11.194
Hi, Mrs. bunker.
Oh, it's Lionel.

17:11.262 --> 17:13.262
I think.

17:15.199 --> 17:17.134
Get over here.

17:19.403 --> 17:21.605
What took you so long?
What happened, Lionel?

17:21.673 --> 17:25.108
This agent came to our house
and said he had to question
your close friends.

17:25.175 --> 17:28.612
Close friends?
Who'd he talk to
over at your house?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.615
The whole family.
We's close friends,
ain't we?

17:31.683 --> 17:34.251
I know that, Lionel,
but tell me what
the man said, huh?

17:34.318 --> 17:36.586
Well, he asked if you were
a loyal American,

17:36.655 --> 17:38.889
if you took more
than a social drink,

17:38.957 --> 17:41.625
do you read much,
did we ever hear you
discuss politics--

17:41.693 --> 17:44.728
yeah, yeah.
Lionel, what did you say?
Oh, let me see.

17:44.796 --> 17:46.930
Yes, no, no, yes,
maybe sometimes--

17:46.998 --> 17:50.134
hold it! Lionel,
I can't follow that!

17:50.201 --> 17:52.435
Tell me what was asked
and what youse answered.

17:52.503 --> 17:55.072
There was nothing
to it, really.
We know what you are,

17:55.140 --> 17:57.074
and we told him.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.848
Lionel, just give me
a "for instance" on that, huh?

18:04.916 --> 18:08.185
Well, we said
you were 100 percent
behind the constitution.

18:08.252 --> 18:10.954
Which I am.
One hundred percent
behind civil rights.

18:11.022 --> 18:12.956
Which I-- hold it.

18:13.024 --> 18:15.059
Well, you are
for civil rights,
aren't you?

18:15.126 --> 18:18.461
Lionel, that depends.
I mean, it depends on
what the man said...

18:18.529 --> 18:20.630
When you told him
I said that.

18:20.699 --> 18:24.101
What did he say?
Oh, he said, "right."

18:25.670 --> 18:30.140
Then, you mean,
the f.B.I. Thinks
I'm for the coloreds?

18:30.208 --> 18:33.677
It don't matter
if you are or not.
We said you was.

18:33.745 --> 18:36.880
And when we say
something nowadays,
they listen.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.254
Bye, Mr. bunker.
[ Mike ]
Bye, Lionel.

18:44.322 --> 18:46.890
Wasn't that sweet
of the jeffersons,

18:46.958 --> 18:49.760
giving you
a nice recommendation?

18:49.828 --> 18:52.129
The f.B.I. Better think
it's nice,

18:52.197 --> 18:56.333
or I'll be wearing
my fruit of the loom
drawers in leavenworth.

18:59.804 --> 19:03.240
Anyone-- anyone home
besides family?

19:03.307 --> 19:05.242
Larry, did anybody
see you coming in here?

19:05.309 --> 19:07.244
No, I snuck in
the back way.

19:07.311 --> 19:09.246
What is this
with the uniform?

19:09.313 --> 19:12.149
I got bugle practice tonight
over at the legion hall.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.484
What are you trying
to prove?

19:14.552 --> 19:16.954
Since when do you have to wear
a uniform to bugle practice?

19:17.021 --> 19:20.023
Since you started flying
your flag at night.

19:20.091 --> 19:24.594
You ain't kidding nobody,
'cause I know there was
a g-man at mcnab's today...

19:24.662 --> 19:26.596
Investigating you.

19:26.664 --> 19:30.000
Investigating me because
I was best buddies with you.

19:30.068 --> 19:32.535
"Was" is right.
"Was" is what I said.

19:32.603 --> 19:35.472
Hey, come on, you guys.
You're letting this thing
snowball.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.474
This fear
and suspicion's crazy.

19:37.541 --> 19:40.010
He's the one that's crazy.
He's calling me un-American.

19:40.078 --> 19:43.247
The f.B.I. Done that.
It ain't my fault
if you're a subversive.

19:43.314 --> 19:45.548
Me? A two-time
commander...

19:45.616 --> 19:49.653
Of American legion post 3201
a subversive?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.822
Benedict Arnold
was an admiral,

19:51.890 --> 19:55.058
and he was as subversive
as a termite.

19:55.126 --> 19:58.896
Listen, you. I fought for
my country. Purple heart--
wounded in action.

19:58.963 --> 20:03.066
Wounded in action?
You was wounded trying to
open a beer can in the px.

20:04.135 --> 20:07.704
It was during the war,
wasn't it?

20:07.772 --> 20:11.508
Listen,
I got war decorations,
too, and real ones.

20:11.575 --> 20:14.577
You want me to get
your "good conduct" medal?

20:14.645 --> 20:17.948
Will you
stay out of this?

20:18.016 --> 20:20.350
I want to tell you
something else.
I don't have to dress up...

20:20.418 --> 20:22.886
In no uniform
like a tin soldier
to prove that I'm American.

20:22.954 --> 20:26.323
You-- you're attacking
the American legion!

20:26.390 --> 20:28.625
No, I ain't, buddy.
I'm attacking you.

20:28.693 --> 20:30.994
I should have known
there was something
a little funny about you...

20:31.062 --> 20:34.131
The night you come into
kelcy's bar with that
weird old pal of yours.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.934
- Who are you talking about?
- I'm talking about petey.

20:37.001 --> 20:39.436
The guy
with the strawberry burl
on the side of his nose.

20:39.503 --> 20:41.638
He was always covering it up
with talcum powder.

20:41.706 --> 20:43.640
Petey,
the white-nosed commie.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.877
Pete--
petey, a commie?

20:46.945 --> 20:49.279
That's right,
and you are his pal.

20:49.347 --> 20:52.449
Listen, don't you point
at me, not with what you got
living in your house.

20:52.516 --> 20:55.719
What are you talking about?
This subversive radical here.

20:55.786 --> 20:59.556
Hey, hey, hey--
you've got him living with you,
and what does that make you?

20:59.623 --> 21:01.658
You longhaired freak.
Hey! Hey!

21:01.726 --> 21:03.660
You keep away from me.

21:03.728 --> 21:08.365
I seen you walking down
the street carrying peace
signs out in the open.

21:08.432 --> 21:11.001
"Peace" this
and "peace" that.

21:11.069 --> 21:15.072
"Down with war."
All kinds of
un-American slogans.

21:15.139 --> 21:18.942
I'm sorry, commander.
I didn't know that peace
was on the subversive list.

21:19.010 --> 21:22.346
You hear that commie talk?
Now, that's a dangerous
subversive.

21:22.413 --> 21:25.682
You're nuts, grundy.
The kid's stupid,
but he ain't dangerous.

21:28.319 --> 21:30.420
<i>No, no, you can't</i>
<i>weasel out of this.</i>

21:30.488 --> 21:32.990
You got a pinko subversive
living under your own roof,

21:33.057 --> 21:34.992
and you're as bad as he is.

21:35.059 --> 21:37.928
Listen. You want to
step outside?
Anytime.

21:37.996 --> 21:40.030
No, daddy!
Oh, no, arch.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.632
No, no!
Keep away from me.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.369
You step outside with me,
you're gonna be the sorriest
white man living.

21:45.436 --> 21:47.504
There ain't never been a day
I couldn't take you.

21:47.571 --> 21:49.172
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.442
You're both acting
like children,
and such good friends.

21:52.510 --> 21:55.979
Don't try to hold me back.
I'm gonna have to beat
the dog out of this guy.

21:56.047 --> 21:58.181
Oh, I'm waiting, bunker.

21:58.249 --> 22:00.183
You are, huh?
You're ready, huh?
Yeah! Yeah!

22:00.251 --> 22:02.519
You're ready to go, huh?
Then take off that uniform!
Yeah!

22:02.586 --> 22:04.888
I ain't gonna fight against
the American uniform.

22:04.956 --> 22:07.891
If I take off this uniform,
you're in big trouble.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.893
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.562
Go on!
Take it off right now!

22:12.630 --> 22:15.332
Well, first I got to go
to bugle practice, don't I?

22:18.169 --> 22:20.170
Listen, you'd better be
on your way,

22:20.238 --> 22:22.339
or they'll be blowing "taps"
for you, bugler.

22:22.407 --> 22:25.909
- Hit the trail.
- I ain't moving an inch until
I get back my fishing rods...

22:25.977 --> 22:28.445
- Which I loaned you
last summer.
- <i>[ Telephone rings ]</i>

22:28.512 --> 22:30.613
Answer that phone.
You want back
the fishing rods...

22:30.681 --> 22:32.615
You loaned to me
last summer, huh?
Hello?

22:32.683 --> 22:35.352
Well, I'll give 'em to you.
They're right in the closet.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.387
Here. Take 'em.

22:37.455 --> 22:41.224
And when you get 'em home,
you know what you can do
with 'em, hooks and all.

22:45.830 --> 22:50.233
Archie, it's about
the investigation.

22:50.301 --> 22:53.903
It's Mr. hoppy,
your shop steward.

22:53.972 --> 22:55.905
Hoppy, the shop--

22:59.210 --> 23:01.979
hiya, Billy.
Archie here. What's up?

23:02.046 --> 23:05.582
Huh?
No kidding?

23:05.649 --> 23:08.085
Yeah, yeah,
I understand, Billy.

23:08.152 --> 23:11.821
Yeah, sure.
Thanks for calling me up.

23:11.889 --> 23:14.224
Yeah. Bye-bye.

23:14.292 --> 23:17.027
What is it, Archie?

23:17.095 --> 23:21.664
That was Billy hoppy,
the shop steward. He's been
calling the guys from work.

23:21.732 --> 23:24.734
It's about
this investigation.

23:24.802 --> 23:28.671
He said it ain't the
f.B.I. Doing it at all.
It's the air force.

23:28.739 --> 23:31.708
It's because of
some defense contract
we had down at the plant.

23:31.775 --> 23:34.978
Defense contract?
Oh, yeah. Them little
gizmos we was making...

23:35.046 --> 23:37.847
That looked like
a bottle cap
with a tail on it.

23:37.915 --> 23:40.617
That was for
the air force?
Yeah.

23:40.684 --> 23:44.388
We finished off that contract
six months ago.

23:44.455 --> 23:47.491
Yeah, yeah.

23:47.558 --> 23:49.759
That's what Billy
reminded 'em, so...

23:49.827 --> 23:53.096
The union called up
the air force, and, uh,

23:53.164 --> 23:55.098
they dropped the whole thing
like that.

23:55.166 --> 23:58.135
Then all the snooping
was for nothing.

23:58.202 --> 24:02.672
- [ Both ]
Yeah.
- Well, ain't that wonderful!

24:02.740 --> 24:05.275
Then you two can
stop fighting.

24:05.343 --> 24:08.045
You can be
best buddies again.

24:09.313 --> 24:11.248
Can't you?

24:38.142 --> 24:40.077
Ah, well.

24:41.946 --> 24:44.647
All that
"best buddy" stuff...

24:46.184 --> 24:48.218
Is all for kids, anyhow.

24:55.759 --> 24:58.562
Hey, arch, listen to this.
We've been doing
some research...

24:58.629 --> 25:01.598
On some of the people
investigated by the government
in the last year.

25:01.665 --> 25:05.835
Yeah, daddy, you're in good
company. Congressmen, senators,
supreme court judges.

25:05.903 --> 25:09.406
Did you hear that, Archie?
How about that?

25:09.474 --> 25:11.908
Yeah.
