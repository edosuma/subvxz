WEBVTT

00:02.657 --> 00:05.177
Oh, my God.

00:05.315 --> 00:07.766
No, hey, no, no, no.
Stop. [ Laughs ] Stop.

00:07.904 --> 00:09.423
<i>One of the more harrowing parts</i>

00:09.561 --> 00:11.321
<i>of complex heart surgeries</i>

00:11.459 --> 00:12.840
<i>is the moment
we wean the patient</i>

00:12.978 --> 00:15.498
<i>off the cardiopulmonary
bypass machine.</i>

00:15.636 --> 00:19.122
Oh, Lucas!

00:19.260 --> 00:21.676
<i>We start slowly warming
the patient.</i>

00:21.814 --> 00:23.126
- You're up early.
- Couldn't sleep.

00:25.094 --> 00:28.269
<i>As the patient's
temperature rises...</i>

00:28.407 --> 00:29.822
<i>we check to make sure
all of the air</i>

00:29.960 --> 00:32.204
<i>has been removed
from the heart.</i>

00:32.342 --> 00:33.757
Good morning!

00:33.895 --> 00:35.725
- Hey.
- Morning.

00:36.657 --> 00:38.210
Coffee for the road?

00:38.348 --> 00:40.109
- Mm.
- You can bring it back tonight.

00:40.247 --> 00:41.869
Thank you.

00:44.009 --> 00:45.735
Anybody want
a weed whacker?

00:45.873 --> 00:48.324
The house on the corner's giving
away a bunch of stuff for free.

00:48.462 --> 00:50.602
Oh, I'm gonna be late,
but I'll see you tonight.

00:53.605 --> 00:55.296
- Bye!
- Bye.

00:55.434 --> 00:57.367
She took my mug.

00:57.505 --> 00:59.093
Apparently,
she'll bring it back. Tonight.

00:59.231 --> 01:00.819
I found some good
bridesmaid dress options.

01:00.957 --> 01:02.131
If you're looking.

01:02.269 --> 01:03.511
Those dresses belong
in a museum.

01:03.649 --> 01:04.719
They're free.
And go away.

01:06.135 --> 01:07.343
You think
that I could officiate?

01:07.481 --> 01:09.310
'Cause I've always wanted
to do that.

01:09.448 --> 01:11.554
I barely know you.

01:11.692 --> 01:13.728
Oh, I'm sorry,
are <i>you</i> gonna do it?

01:13.866 --> 01:15.144
Trey and I still have
a lot to figure out.

01:15.282 --> 01:16.904
Yes!
I'm in the mix.

01:17.042 --> 01:19.182
<i>Once the aortic cross-clamp
is removed,</i>

01:19.320 --> 01:22.358
<i>all eyes are on the heart
for that moment of truth.</i>

01:22.496 --> 01:23.876
<i>Will it start to beat?</i>

01:25.947 --> 01:27.535
Hey,
can I borrow a shirt?

01:27.673 --> 01:28.916
I need to bring some
more clothes over here.

01:29.054 --> 01:30.435
Uh, help yourself.

01:30.573 --> 01:31.953
Thank you.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.335
You know, I'm gonna
go make breakfast.

01:34.473 --> 01:37.787
Uh, meant to tell you--
We are out of the good granola.

01:37.925 --> 01:39.099
Really?
I just bought some.

01:39.237 --> 01:40.686
I know.
Been on a yogurt kick.

01:40.824 --> 01:42.032
I'll get some more.

01:42.171 --> 01:43.862
Oh, is that Kai?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.415
Will you tell them I said hi?
When are they coming back here?

01:45.553 --> 01:47.037
I've got this documentary
I want to show them.

01:47.176 --> 01:48.763
Yeah, can I talk about this
a little later?

01:48.901 --> 01:50.420
Yeah.
Um, they're about
to go into a meeting,

01:50.558 --> 01:51.352
so I just-- I've gotta--No, of course, of course.

01:51.490 --> 01:53.009
To be continued.

01:56.668 --> 01:59.533
Oh, uh,
I'm-- I'm sorry.

01:59.671 --> 02:03.053
I didn't know anyone was here,
um, doing this.

02:03.192 --> 02:05.642
Morning, baby.
Meet Taya.

02:05.780 --> 02:09.957
Taya is Seattle's most highly
regarded Reiki practitioner.

02:10.095 --> 02:12.304
R-Reiki.
Uh, of-- of course.

02:12.442 --> 02:15.307
Reiki, you know, it's
an energy healing technique.

02:15.445 --> 02:20.312
It clears the mind, promotes
relaxation, improves focus.

02:20.450 --> 02:22.625
I thought I'd give it a try
before my surgery today.

02:22.763 --> 02:24.420
- You want to go next?
- Uh, no, no, thank you.

02:24.558 --> 02:26.076
I was just, uh,
looking for my raincoat.

02:26.215 --> 02:28.148
It's in the hall closet.

02:33.739 --> 02:36.259
And it's not like my workload
has just evaporated.

02:36.397 --> 02:37.985
My paperwork has doubled
with the clinic.

02:38.123 --> 02:41.851
Oh, please complain more about
data entry to a chief resident.

02:41.989 --> 02:44.233
You want to make it a contest?
Because I work two jobs,

02:44.371 --> 02:45.648
I moonlight in general,
plus I'm a mom.

02:45.786 --> 02:47.097
That's like four jobs.

02:47.236 --> 02:48.444
Well, I feel like
I have seven.

02:48.582 --> 02:49.997
I'm having
recurring dreams

02:50.135 --> 02:51.930
about intern
rotation assignments

02:52.068 --> 02:54.829
when I should be
dreaming about... hot nurse.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.831
What?
Hot.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.281
Nurse. Hot.
What?

02:58.419 --> 02:59.696
Carlos. Oh, wait, quick.
Hide-- Hide me.

02:59.834 --> 03:01.422
Oh, my God.
What is happening right now?

03:01.560 --> 03:05.530
Carlos and I had
a-an interaction

03:05.668 --> 03:07.532
at the intern
house party.

03:07.670 --> 03:09.119
A quality interaction?

03:09.258 --> 03:12.295
Very high quality, yes.

03:12.433 --> 03:15.505
And afterwards,
he gave me his number.

03:15.643 --> 03:17.197
So, what's the problem?

03:17.335 --> 03:18.646
He thinks I'm cool.

03:18.784 --> 03:21.062
So?
Look at me.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.375
Okay, well, just take off
the bike helmet.

03:23.513 --> 03:24.687
Okay.

03:28.415 --> 03:30.451
- I'll tell you when he's gone.
- Oh, gosh.

03:31.866 --> 03:33.489
Hey, have you assigned someone
to supervise me today?

03:33.627 --> 03:35.145
Right, I knew I was
forgetting something.

03:35.284 --> 03:36.561
I have to got to look
at microscopes

03:36.699 --> 03:38.425
and then a compliance meeting,
whatever that is,

03:38.563 --> 03:40.530
so somewhere between that
and the hundred other things

03:40.668 --> 03:43.050
I have to do, uh,
I will get you a supervisor.

03:43.188 --> 03:44.327
Do that first.
Owen, I-I--

03:44.465 --> 03:47.157
I called
the medical commission.

03:47.296 --> 03:48.504
- And said what?
- I asked them for an appeal,

03:48.642 --> 03:50.057
and they granted me one.

03:50.195 --> 03:51.127
They're sending
a preceptor.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.508
He will assess me,
and if I pass,

03:52.646 --> 03:54.889
they will temporarily
reinstate my license.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.098
You just decided that? You
didn't even talk to me about it?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.100
You and I are broken.
You know it, I know it.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.068
I'm pretty sure
the entire hospital knows it.

04:01.206 --> 04:02.828
If I can
practice medicine again,

04:02.966 --> 04:05.555
maybe we can stop
resenting each other.

04:05.693 --> 04:07.074
Alright, when are they
coming to assess you?

04:07.212 --> 04:08.593
Today.
He's downstairs right now.

04:08.731 --> 04:11.734
So, about the supervisor.

04:11.872 --> 04:15.289
Porter's with Ndugu.
Millin's with Dr. Webber.

04:15.427 --> 04:17.878
Griffith and Yasuda,
you're with, uh, Shepherd.

04:18.016 --> 04:20.087
And Massey's on scut.

04:20.225 --> 04:21.744
As a gentle reminder,

04:21.882 --> 04:25.057
I will be in the OR today
with the Dr. Fox,

04:25.195 --> 04:28.060
so do not page me, call me,
or attempt to find me.

04:28.198 --> 04:29.752
Uh, what if our patient
is dying?

04:29.890 --> 04:33.238
Take that attitude
and channel it into saving them.

04:35.516 --> 04:37.035
Move.

04:37.173 --> 04:39.348
I've come to return my interns.

04:39.486 --> 04:40.797
Pretty sure there's
a no-return policy.

04:40.935 --> 04:42.765
All my surgeries
have been canceled.

04:42.903 --> 04:44.629
Only thing they'd be learning is
how to be the viper of Seattle.

04:44.767 --> 04:48.149
Well, I see that a possible
teaching opportunity--

04:48.288 --> 04:50.635
- Where do you want us?
- Look, just give me a second.

04:50.773 --> 04:52.119
Dr. Schmitt,
we're late.

04:52.257 --> 04:53.603
Oh, I'm--
I'm so sorry, Dr. Fox.

04:53.741 --> 04:56.157
I just need to reassign
these interns.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.298
Who wants to come
fix a penis?

04:58.436 --> 04:59.747
Totally.
I'm in.

04:59.885 --> 05:01.542
Consider them reassigned.
Let's go, fellas.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.716
Let's go.

05:05.960 --> 05:09.757
Uh, Natalia Asaki, 32, post-op
day two from right craniotomy

05:09.895 --> 05:12.070
for resection
of a metastatic lesion

05:12.208 --> 05:14.314
from the primary
esophageal carcinoma.

05:14.452 --> 05:16.592
Well, your incision
is healing well, Natalia.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.214
No sign of infection.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.112
Will I be able
to travel soon?

05:20.250 --> 05:22.667
Honey, you just had
brain surgery.

05:22.805 --> 05:24.220
Let's not
rush anything, okay?

05:24.358 --> 05:26.809
Our friends chipped in

05:26.947 --> 05:29.432
to give us
a divorce-honeymoon.

05:29.570 --> 05:33.471
We want to go to Europe
to see the sunsets.

05:33.609 --> 05:35.818
Sunset is Natalia's
favorite time of the day.

05:35.956 --> 05:40.305
Mm. It's the magical hour when
the sky becomes a painting.

05:40.443 --> 05:43.032
My wife and I took
a spectacular trip recently,

05:43.170 --> 05:46.035
and yes,
it really does feed the soul.

05:46.173 --> 05:48.624
See? Our trip is
doctor-recommended.

05:50.626 --> 05:53.214
When can we book
our plane ticket, Dr. Webber?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.216
Well, we need to get
a PET scan first.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.770
And then we'll re-stage
the cancer,

05:56.908 --> 05:58.599
and we'll go from there.

05:58.737 --> 05:59.807
Thank you.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.190
Venice first.

06:03.328 --> 06:05.123
If there's gelato,
I'll follow you anywhere.

06:05.261 --> 06:06.366
Yes.

06:09.023 --> 06:10.887
Barbara Collins, 45,

06:11.025 --> 06:12.820
presents with double vision
and headaches.

06:12.958 --> 06:15.305
A CT revealed a tumor in
the center region of the brain.

06:15.444 --> 06:17.135
Today, we will do
a trans-ventricular

06:17.273 --> 06:18.895
endoscopic approach
to resect it.

06:19.033 --> 06:20.621
And once removed,
we'll send it to pathology

06:20.759 --> 06:24.487
to determine if the mass
is benign or cancerous.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.352
And there it is. Our baby sister
finally has cancer.

06:27.490 --> 06:28.974
Took you long enough.

06:29.112 --> 06:32.150
Dr. Shepherd, meet my sisters,
Didi and Paula.

06:32.288 --> 06:35.567
They flew in from Boston last
night to offer their... support.

06:35.705 --> 06:37.742
We never miss
a cancer diagnosis.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.882
We don't know for sure
that it is cancer.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.297
I'll need to obtain
tissue first.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.748
She has it.
We've all had it.

06:43.886 --> 06:46.475
I had breast cancer,
Carol had skin cancer,

06:46.613 --> 06:48.511
and Paula had butt cancer.

06:48.649 --> 06:50.030
We all get it, and then
we make the best of it.

06:50.168 --> 06:51.480
That's right. Yeah.

06:51.618 --> 06:53.516
Barbara, you can finally
come to cancer camp.

06:53.654 --> 06:55.898
We go every year
with our chemo girls,

06:56.036 --> 06:57.037
but this one never
could because--

06:57.175 --> 06:58.487
- No cancer.
- No cancer.

06:58.625 --> 07:02.180
Oh, I forgot.
I brought champagne.

07:02.318 --> 07:03.492
Huh?

07:03.630 --> 07:06.011
Our mother was fertile
for 40 years,

07:06.149 --> 07:08.358
and she finally gave up sex
when Barbara was born.

07:08.497 --> 07:09.705
Is your other sister
on her way?

07:09.843 --> 07:13.087
Carol? No.
She's, uh...

07:13.225 --> 07:15.400
Oh, no. Ladies,

07:15.538 --> 07:16.712
meet Carol.

07:16.850 --> 07:19.646
She died 15 years ago.

07:19.784 --> 07:22.234
Well, she kicked the cancer,
but then she fell off a ladder.

07:22.372 --> 07:24.340
She was always
the clumsy one.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.617
Your sister's in that box?

07:25.755 --> 07:27.067
- Yeah.
- Yep.

07:27.205 --> 07:28.551
Well,
we take her everywhere.

07:28.689 --> 07:30.173
She loved meeting
new people.

07:30.311 --> 07:31.589
Yeah.

07:31.727 --> 07:33.729
It's nice--
nice to meet you.

07:36.076 --> 07:37.422
- Aww.
- See, that's nice.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.872
Good for you.

07:39.010 --> 07:39.907
Yeah.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.921
Oh. Bailey. Hey. Look,
I want to apologize

07:54.059 --> 07:56.786
for Owen and I fighting in front
of you and Ben at dinner.

07:56.924 --> 07:58.512
Cappuccino?

08:00.514 --> 08:02.758
Fine.

08:02.896 --> 08:05.450
Honestly, your pie
was the first thing

08:05.588 --> 08:07.521
that Owen and I
agreed on in months.

08:07.659 --> 08:10.662
I mean, the best pie ever.
The most tender crust,

08:10.800 --> 08:13.078
and the filling was sweet,
but not too sweet.

08:13.216 --> 08:15.287
I mean,
what is your secret?

08:15.425 --> 08:18.325
You know, you're my boss now.
You don't have to butter me up.

08:18.463 --> 08:21.155
No, I dreamt about your pie, truly.

08:21.293 --> 08:24.711
You can just ask for
what you want, Dr. Altman.

08:24.849 --> 08:28.577
Owen is being evaluated by
the medical commission today,

08:28.715 --> 08:30.958
and he's trying really hard
to fix this,

08:31.096 --> 08:32.926
and if anything goes wrong,

08:33.064 --> 08:35.376
he can't be reevaluated
for another six months.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.861
I'm still waiting
for the question.

08:36.999 --> 08:38.828
Would you supervise him,
please?
No.

08:38.966 --> 08:41.175
What happened to I'm your boss
and I can ask for what I want?

08:41.313 --> 08:43.419
Doesn't mean I have to say yes.
I'm busy.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.283
And I'm rooting for him.

08:45.421 --> 08:46.698
Mm.

08:46.836 --> 08:48.666
Okay.

08:53.153 --> 08:54.361
Link.

08:54.499 --> 08:56.121
What are you doing
right now?

08:56.259 --> 08:59.331
Gerald Lien, age 60,

08:59.469 --> 09:01.851
a history of increasingly
painful, curved erections

09:01.989 --> 09:05.337
that led to a diagnosis
of Peyronie's disease.

09:05.475 --> 09:07.029
Okay,
so who can tell me

09:07.167 --> 09:09.790
the pathophysiology
of this disease?

09:09.928 --> 09:11.205
It's an
inflammatory condition

09:11.343 --> 09:12.793
that can cause
a bend in the penis,

09:12.931 --> 09:14.554
and it's thought to be
caused from repeated injuries

09:14.692 --> 09:17.487
due to athletics,
accidents, or sex.

09:17.626 --> 09:20.905
Correct.
Okay, let's go meet Gerald.

09:21.043 --> 09:22.562
Gerald.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.219
So nice to see you again.

09:25.357 --> 09:29.154
This is Dr. Schmitt,
Dr. Kwan, and Dr. Adams.

09:29.292 --> 09:31.225
They're gonna be
assisting me today.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.400
Gerald first came to me
about six months ago,

09:33.538 --> 09:35.367
when his symptoms
first started,

09:35.505 --> 09:36.990
and we weren't able
to help him surgically

09:37.128 --> 09:40.269
because we needed to wait
until the progression stabilized

09:40.407 --> 09:41.408
and there was
no further curvature.

09:41.546 --> 09:43.134
You had to wait
six months?

09:44.860 --> 09:46.378
Uh, sorry.
Please just fix it.

09:46.516 --> 09:49.209
You can fix it, right?
So I can stop avoiding my wife?

09:49.347 --> 09:52.005
Today, Dr. Fox will resect
the plaques that have built up

09:52.143 --> 09:55.525
and then place a xenograft
to repair the damage.

09:55.664 --> 09:58.425
Gerald, are you sure there
isn't anyone you want to call

09:58.563 --> 10:00.807
and let them know
you're having surgery today?

10:00.945 --> 10:04.017
My wife and our friends think
I'm at a conference right now,

10:04.155 --> 10:06.606
where, in about three hours,
I'm gonna pull a muscle,

10:06.744 --> 10:08.608
which will require me to be
in bed for a couple days.

10:08.746 --> 10:11.196
Understood.
Alright, Schmitt, Kwan, Adams,

10:11.334 --> 10:13.405
let's go and study
his penile ultrasound,

10:13.543 --> 10:15.545
and I will see you
in the O.R.

10:15.684 --> 10:16.892
Thank you, Dr. Fox.

10:19.342 --> 10:20.861
I'll need her latest scans
so we can go over

10:20.999 --> 10:22.380
my approach
and positioning--

10:22.518 --> 10:24.796
Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd?
Didi and I were wondering

10:24.934 --> 10:26.936
if you could tell us
where we could get some coffee.

10:27.074 --> 10:28.766
Uh-- Uh, there's
a cafeteria downstairs,

10:28.904 --> 10:31.216
or Dr. Yasuda could grab
some from the lounge.

10:31.354 --> 10:32.424
- Oh, that would be great.
- Oh.

10:32.562 --> 10:34.357
Sure.
Two coffees, coming right up.

10:34.495 --> 10:35.980
Actually, three.

10:36.118 --> 10:38.051
Uh, and Carol takes hers
with cream and sugar.

10:38.189 --> 10:39.362
She always
had a sweet tooth.

10:40.778 --> 10:41.710
Okay. Sure.

10:41.848 --> 10:43.228
Thank you, Dr. Yasuda.

10:43.366 --> 10:45.230
Mm-hmm.

10:45.368 --> 10:46.922
How do I get coffee
for a dead person?

10:47.060 --> 10:48.786
Same way you get coffee
for a living person.

10:48.924 --> 10:50.857
Pour it in a cup.

10:50.995 --> 10:53.480
You worried she'll get mad at
you if you screw up her order?

10:58.312 --> 11:00.901
It looks like a... Boomerang.

11:01.039 --> 11:03.524
- How does he pee?
- Sideways?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.112
As you can see,
the ultrasound shows

11:05.250 --> 11:07.287
a build-up
of fibrous plaques,

11:07.425 --> 11:09.807
and these plaques
can contain calcifications

11:09.945 --> 11:11.325
or completely ossify,
which means--

11:11.463 --> 11:13.258
The tissue
can turn to bone.

11:13.396 --> 11:16.676
Correct. It's worth noting
this is not an ortho case.

11:16.814 --> 11:18.678
It's very complex.

11:18.816 --> 11:23.855
So be sure to carefully review
the ultrasound studies.

11:23.993 --> 11:27.134
Be extremely prepared.
Then get him up to pre-op.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.590
So, he's got bone...

11:34.728 --> 11:36.765
In his bone.

11:36.903 --> 11:38.076
Nope.

11:40.147 --> 11:43.012
Penile surgery can be
bloody and messy,

11:43.150 --> 11:45.532
and if anything goes wrong,
this man's erectile function

11:45.670 --> 11:46.671
will be permanently impaired.

11:46.809 --> 11:48.984
So, let's hear 'em.

11:49.122 --> 11:51.227
All of 'em, right now.

11:51.365 --> 11:53.471
Get your jokes out now.

11:53.609 --> 11:56.060
Not one more after you
set foot outside that door.

11:56.198 --> 11:57.682
Captain Hook. Gargoyle gherkin.
Bendy straw.

12:00.961 --> 12:02.445
Get back to work.

12:07.623 --> 12:09.556
Today, I'll be assessing
your clinical skills,

12:09.694 --> 12:12.076
bedside manner,
- and diagnostic knowledge.
- Yeah.

12:12.214 --> 12:13.663
I want you to pretend
I'm not here.

12:13.802 --> 12:15.320
Do everything
like you normally would.

12:15.458 --> 12:18.185
Yeah.
Mr. Williams, I am Dr. Hunt.

12:18.323 --> 12:19.911
I am here to take a look
at that cut.

12:20.049 --> 12:21.741
- Can you tell me how it happened?
- What's he doing here?

12:21.879 --> 12:23.156
Oh, sorry, I should have
introduced myself.

12:23.294 --> 12:24.191
I'm Dr. Lincoln.

12:24.329 --> 12:26.193
You-- You killed
the Tank.

12:26.331 --> 12:27.332
Mnh-mnh.
I don't want him touching me.

12:27.470 --> 12:29.541
Dr. Lincoln is
an excellent surgeon,

12:29.679 --> 12:30.750
but he is just here
to observe today.

12:30.888 --> 12:32.752
Observe what?

12:32.890 --> 12:35.340
Wh-- Well, I am
in a probationary period.

12:35.478 --> 12:36.997
Not because of any malpractice
or anything,

12:37.135 --> 12:39.034
more bureaucratic stuff.

12:39.172 --> 12:41.208
I assure you, I am a fully
board certified trauma surgeon,

12:41.346 --> 12:43.901
more than capable of sewing up
a small head laceration.

12:44.039 --> 12:46.213
So, when you're ready--

12:46.351 --> 12:48.733
I'll wait for another doctor.
Not you.

12:48.871 --> 12:50.942
Mr. Williams,
I really need to close that up

12:51.080 --> 12:52.116
before it becomes infected,
so--

12:52.254 --> 12:53.842
Mm,
I'll take my chances.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.431
Alright.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.192
So, the PET scan
won't take long.

12:59.330 --> 13:00.952
You can go back to planning
your trip once we're finished.

13:01.090 --> 13:03.092
Our first stop
is the island

13:03.230 --> 13:06.613
where Monet painted
"San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk."

13:06.751 --> 13:10.617
He's one of
my favorite painters.

13:10.755 --> 13:12.550
Do you have a favorite place
in Europe, Dr. Millin?

13:12.688 --> 13:14.241
I have never been,

13:14.379 --> 13:15.725
but I've always wanted
to go to Paris someday.

13:15.864 --> 13:17.244
Ooh!

13:17.382 --> 13:20.213
She has a case
of the somedays.

13:20.351 --> 13:22.146
The what?
Natalia always says

13:22.284 --> 13:23.803
that there are seven days
in a week,

13:23.941 --> 13:26.426
and someday
isn't one of them.

13:26.564 --> 13:29.774
When you live in "someday,"
you waste today.

13:29.912 --> 13:31.914
I had a real bad case
until I met her. She
knocked it out of me.

13:32.052 --> 13:34.434
The last time he used
the word "someday,"

13:34.572 --> 13:36.470
I made him sleep
in the guest room.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.128
Also known as the porch.
She made me sleep on the porch.

13:42.476 --> 13:45.410
Oh, God, she's bleeding!
Hey, Natalia, hey.

13:45.548 --> 13:47.827
I need suction and a crash cart,
and page Dr. Webber! Now!

13:47.965 --> 13:49.967
It's okay.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

13:50.105 --> 13:51.037
Into this.
Can you breathe?

13:58.561 --> 14:00.667
You know Peyronie's disease
is actually really common?

14:00.805 --> 14:03.359
Affects 1 in 11 men.

14:03.497 --> 14:05.292
Worried you got
a kink in the hose?

14:05.430 --> 14:07.467
If you bring that hyena home
again tonight,

14:07.605 --> 14:08.848
I am sleeping in my van.

14:08.986 --> 14:10.125
How is that a threat?

14:10.263 --> 14:11.920
Her name is Cara.

14:12.058 --> 14:14.198
Yeah, Cara
from internal medicine.

14:14.336 --> 14:15.544
Did she wear
her stethoscope in bed?

14:15.682 --> 14:17.511
What does that
even mean?

14:17.649 --> 14:19.272
Is she why you're worried
you have Peyronie's disease?

14:19.410 --> 14:20.929
- You're worried about Peyronie's?
- No.

14:21.067 --> 14:22.344
I don't trust anyone
who doesn't cut.

14:22.482 --> 14:24.829
You know, maybe I'm not
interested in "trusting" her.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.142
The people need sleep!

14:28.660 --> 14:31.698
Are you kidding me?
I have to get out of here.

14:31.836 --> 14:32.872
I understand.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.287
Seems like
it's going well.

14:34.425 --> 14:36.358
That woman is yelling
in his face.

14:36.496 --> 14:38.187
Well, it's not you
for once.

14:38.325 --> 14:40.396
This is me trying
to be encouraging.

14:40.534 --> 14:42.019
It's a UTI.Owen: You're probably right,

14:42.157 --> 14:43.675
but I need to do
a full work-up,

14:43.813 --> 14:45.539
just to make sure that
nothing else is going on.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.956
It burns when I pee,
and I have to go all the time.

14:48.094 --> 14:49.889
It's textbook UTI.

14:50.027 --> 14:51.994
Just give me the antibiotics,
and I'll free up a bed.

14:52.132 --> 14:54.341
We can't. I need to take your
vitals and take a urine sample.

14:54.479 --> 14:55.722
And how long
will that take?

14:55.860 --> 14:57.724
That depends on how busy
the labs are,

14:57.862 --> 14:59.691
but I promise we will get you
out of here as soon as we can.

14:59.829 --> 15:02.522
Okay, I'm already missing the
study group for my logic class,

15:02.660 --> 15:04.662
and then I have an econ paper
due at 5:00 p.m.,

15:04.800 --> 15:06.181
and my restaurant shift
starts at 7:00.

15:06.319 --> 15:07.941
I don't have time
for this.

15:08.079 --> 15:10.219
I'll just use my friend's
leftover antibiotics.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.014
No, no, no.
I wouldn't recommend that.

15:15.638 --> 15:16.708
Okay, what's next?

15:18.572 --> 15:20.574
We just need to send off
your type and screen,

15:20.712 --> 15:22.335
and then we'll
be ready to go.

15:22.473 --> 15:23.923
Okay.

15:24.061 --> 15:25.683
Uh, can I
ask you something?

15:25.821 --> 15:27.616
- Now that it's just you and me?
- Of course.

15:27.754 --> 15:30.688
If things don't go smoothly
in there, could it be permanent?

15:30.826 --> 15:33.760
There's always the possibility
of tissue damage,

15:33.898 --> 15:36.211
nerve damage, or more
severe erectile dysfunction,

15:36.349 --> 15:38.938
but that only happens
in 20% of the cases.

15:39.076 --> 15:41.492
And Dr. Fox is excellent.

15:41.630 --> 15:43.356
Oh.

15:43.494 --> 15:45.358
My wife's name is Gloria,
but I call her Glow

15:45.496 --> 15:48.982
because she...
just glows.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.571
She was a history professor
before she retired.

15:51.709 --> 15:55.230
She loves big concerts,
dive restaurants,

15:55.368 --> 15:57.197
and the ocean,
and I didn't tell her

15:57.335 --> 15:59.751
because I didn't want her
to feel sorry for me.

15:59.889 --> 16:01.650
Or look at me differently.

16:01.788 --> 16:03.755
So, what if I'm
in that 20%?

16:03.893 --> 16:06.448
How long have you been married?37 years.

16:06.586 --> 16:09.037
I don't think that your
condition will be permanent,

16:09.175 --> 16:11.349
but your marriage
sounds like it is.

16:11.487 --> 16:13.731
Right.

16:13.869 --> 16:16.182
I'll be back in a few minutes
to take you to pre-op.

16:19.564 --> 16:22.015
Right there.
Natalia's esophageal tumor

16:22.153 --> 16:24.811
has eroded into the aorta
and the posterior mediastinum.

16:24.949 --> 16:27.055
Tumor's everywhere.

16:27.193 --> 16:29.091
So, her heart's
bleeding out.

16:29.229 --> 16:30.782
Essentially, yeah.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.267
Can you resect it?

16:32.405 --> 16:33.440
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

16:33.578 --> 16:36.512
You paged me?

16:36.650 --> 16:38.756
I need a second opinion.

16:38.894 --> 16:42.277
Large esophageal mass,

16:42.415 --> 16:46.212
which has eroded into
the aorta and pericardium.

16:48.386 --> 16:50.319
Sorry.
Uh, you don't think

16:50.457 --> 16:51.976
a-a descending stent graft
would work?

16:52.114 --> 16:53.184
That won't help her.

16:53.322 --> 16:54.703
Well, so what do we do now?

16:54.841 --> 16:57.637
Nothing.
Best thing we can do

16:57.775 --> 17:01.986
for Natalia is, uh,
give her pain medication

17:02.124 --> 17:03.850
and help her
go peacefully.

17:06.853 --> 17:08.855
How much time do I have?

17:08.993 --> 17:10.477
It depends.

17:10.615 --> 17:14.516
Could be anywhere
from a few days

17:14.654 --> 17:16.449
to a few hours.

17:18.899 --> 17:20.901
I'm so sorry, Natalia.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.869
We'll make sure
you're comfortable.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.664
Whatever you need.

17:24.802 --> 17:26.804
Thank you.

17:26.942 --> 17:30.221
When Elliot gets back,
we can walk him through this.

17:30.359 --> 17:32.465
We know that these
conversations can be difficult.

17:32.603 --> 17:34.122
No.

17:34.260 --> 17:37.849
Just let us
plan our trip.

17:37.987 --> 17:40.680
Natalia, your husband
needs to be prepared.

17:40.818 --> 17:42.475
He needs to say goodbye.

17:42.613 --> 17:45.029
No, he doesn't.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.376
He doesn't need that.

17:47.514 --> 17:49.689
We cannot handle that.

17:52.795 --> 17:55.315
Please.

17:55.453 --> 17:58.870
Let us... plan our trip.

18:13.471 --> 18:15.508
I talked to Nurse Staci,
and I got the full download.

18:15.646 --> 18:17.165
- The full download?
- Yeah. Carlos.

18:17.303 --> 18:19.063
Okay, dogs, not cats.

18:19.201 --> 18:21.790
Star Trek, not Star Wars.
That's good, right?

18:21.928 --> 18:23.654
And then, oh, he went
to Costa Rica last year

18:23.792 --> 18:25.380
just to see the sloths.

18:25.518 --> 18:27.692
- Isn't that so cute?
- This is stalking.

18:27.830 --> 18:30.109
I really don't want to be
implicated in a stalking case.

18:30.247 --> 18:31.938
Listen, you and Nico broke up
over a year ago.

18:32.076 --> 18:34.182
- I have surgery.
- Oh, my God.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.184
Will you just talk to him?
It's not a big deal.

18:36.322 --> 18:38.220
No. I am not you.

18:38.358 --> 18:40.602
Why is it that every time
someone like me feels insecure,

18:40.740 --> 18:43.018
a very good-looking,
charming person is like,

18:43.156 --> 18:45.020
"Just do it.
It's not a big deal.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.022
It's fun.
It'll be easy"?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.748
Oh, and he hates
vampire shows!

18:50.163 --> 18:52.752
I know you're scared
of vampires.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.271
So, you got kids?

18:54.409 --> 18:56.825
Yes.

18:56.963 --> 18:58.930
- Okay, what do we got?
- Edgar Reyes, 38,

18:59.068 --> 19:01.485
MVC, unrestrained driver
with blunt trauma to the chest.

19:01.623 --> 19:03.280
Got diminished breath
sounds bilaterally,

19:03.418 --> 19:04.522
satting at 80%.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.490
BP is 95/40.

19:06.628 --> 19:07.974
Intubated and needle decompressions
done in the field.

19:08.112 --> 19:09.424
You ready?
On my count.

19:09.562 --> 19:12.047
1, 2, 3, let's go.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.704
Okay,
let's bring in the X-ray.

19:13.842 --> 19:15.326
Okay, sats are dropping.

19:15.464 --> 19:18.812
I'm seeing extensive
subcutaneous emphysema.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.055
Plate's already in.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.229
Alright, here we go.

19:22.989 --> 19:24.508
Damn it.
Deviated trachea.

19:24.646 --> 19:26.095
I can't make out
if there's a hemothorax

19:26.234 --> 19:29.271
with all the air
in the tissue.

19:29.409 --> 19:31.480
Okay, there's no oxygen
getting to his lungs.

19:31.618 --> 19:33.310
Systolic's falling.
We should call for bronchoscopy.

19:33.448 --> 19:35.277
He'll be dead by then,
especially if he has
a ruptured airway.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.521
Get me a 10-blade,
gloves, and betadine.

19:37.659 --> 19:39.971
- What the hell are you doing?
- He might have a tracheal injury.

19:40.109 --> 19:42.215
We need to do something
before he codes.

19:42.353 --> 19:44.769
So wait for the bronchoscopy
so you don't go in blind.

19:44.907 --> 19:47.634
We don't have time for me
to check all those boxes, okay?

19:47.772 --> 19:49.429
Somebody page Dr. Ndugu!

19:52.432 --> 19:56.264
Who can tell me
why I am injecting the penis

19:56.402 --> 20:00.509
with papaverine
to induce an erection?

20:00.647 --> 20:03.098
Hello?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.893
The penis must be erect--

20:05.031 --> 20:06.860
In order to place
the correct anatomic markings.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.173
Correct. 15-blade.

20:09.311 --> 20:11.175
Dr. Kwan,
should I make the incision

20:11.313 --> 20:13.591
on the long or short side
of the curvature?

20:15.835 --> 20:16.491
Short side.

20:16.629 --> 20:17.630
Correct.

20:17.768 --> 20:20.529
Here we go.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.048
Oh, nice blood flow.

20:22.186 --> 20:23.636
Suction, Kwan.

20:25.603 --> 20:26.708
Kwan.

20:26.846 --> 20:28.054
Blue?
Kwan.

20:28.192 --> 20:29.883
Blue.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.333
I would have bet my money
on the other one.

20:31.471 --> 20:32.541
Oh, crap.

20:32.679 --> 20:33.853
Eyes on the field, Schmitt.

20:33.991 --> 20:36.683
Someone get that intern
off my O.R. floor.

20:36.821 --> 20:38.064
Adams,
get him out of here.

20:38.202 --> 20:39.203
If I leave,
can I come back?

20:39.341 --> 20:41.481
Now!

20:48.143 --> 20:49.731
So, there's a chance
I won't remember anything

20:49.869 --> 20:51.526
- when I wake up?
- Well, there is a chance,

20:51.664 --> 20:54.183
but I'm very, very good
at my job.

20:54.322 --> 20:55.840
Oh, don't worry, honey,
you'll be fine.

20:55.978 --> 20:57.325
The doctors told Paula

20:57.463 --> 20:59.223
she'd never be able
to eat spicy food.

20:59.361 --> 21:01.432
And I eat hot sauce
on my eggs every day.

21:01.570 --> 21:04.021
And remember when they forgot
to give Didi her nipple?

21:04.159 --> 21:05.678
Who needs two nipples?

21:05.816 --> 21:08.025
Yeah, see, there.
- It all works out.
- You know what?

21:08.163 --> 21:09.785
We really need to get her
into the operating room.

21:09.923 --> 21:12.236
Her pulse is thready. But I will
update you as soon as I can.

21:12.374 --> 21:14.514
Okay. Mwah.
We'll be waiting for you.

21:14.652 --> 21:16.205
Yeah,
all three of us.

21:16.344 --> 21:17.759
What's wrong
with my pulse?

21:17.897 --> 21:19.416
Nothing.
It's perfect.

21:19.554 --> 21:22.350
But sometimes,
we need our space.

21:22.488 --> 21:25.422
You're right.
You are very good at your job.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.148
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Pathology, extension 2479.</i>

21:28.287 --> 21:30.737
<i>Pathology,
extension 2479.</i>

21:38.262 --> 21:40.506
Mr. Asaki,
is everything alright?

21:42.784 --> 21:45.373
Natalia sent me
to get hot chocolate.

21:45.511 --> 21:46.822
She only does that
when she knows

21:46.960 --> 21:48.755
that things are
gonna get worse.

21:48.893 --> 21:50.412
It's her tell.

21:54.554 --> 21:57.281
Coughing up blood is not
a sign of recovery, is it?

21:57.419 --> 22:00.319
There are always
unforeseen complications

22:00.457 --> 22:03.460
with any kind of cancer.

22:03.598 --> 22:05.738
Is she dying?

22:05.876 --> 22:07.395
This is really
a conversation

22:07.533 --> 22:09.431
you should be having
with your wife.

22:13.746 --> 22:15.610
Do we at least
have a month?

22:17.957 --> 22:19.993
A week?

22:22.824 --> 22:25.240
Do I have today?

22:31.246 --> 22:33.628
I just need a minute.

22:33.766 --> 22:36.631
I don't want her
to see me like this.

22:36.769 --> 22:38.943
I don't want to cause her
any more pain.

22:50.645 --> 22:52.198
Oxygen saturation
still dropping, Hunt.

22:52.336 --> 22:53.510
It's at 62%.

22:53.648 --> 22:55.650
Tube's in. Ambu bag.

22:55.788 --> 22:57.997
We had to do the clamshell
to get a better visualization

22:58.135 --> 22:59.654
of the tracheal repair.

22:59.792 --> 23:01.518
Okay.
Sats are rising.

23:01.656 --> 23:03.140
Oh, wow. Okay.

23:03.278 --> 23:04.728
Patient is
hemodynamically unstable.

23:04.866 --> 23:08.041
He needs an exploration and
a definitive tracheal repair.

23:08.179 --> 23:09.698
Alright. Okay.
Let's go.

23:26.163 --> 23:27.923
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Dr. Erica Newton to Trauma 2.</i>

23:28.061 --> 23:29.649
<i>Dr. Newton to Trauma 2.</i>

23:40.867 --> 23:43.939
Dr. Millin?
Are you alright?

23:44.077 --> 23:46.563
We're Natalia's doctors,

23:46.701 --> 23:50.049
and she is dying, and we are
standing here doing nothing.

23:50.187 --> 23:51.568
You gave her pain meds.
That's not nothing.

23:51.706 --> 23:53.846
She trusted us.

23:53.984 --> 23:56.883
We should be doing everything we
can think of to fix her heart.

23:57.021 --> 23:59.161
I mean, isn't that what you
would want if it were you?

23:59.299 --> 24:01.370
Or your wife?

24:01.509 --> 24:04.477
I wanted to become a surgeon
because we heal people.

24:04.615 --> 24:07.273
You don't just prescribe
them medicine and wait
to see if it works.

24:07.411 --> 24:09.378
You wheel them to the O.R.,
and then you open them up,

24:09.517 --> 24:11.139
and then you fix them.

24:13.003 --> 24:15.799
That's our job.
And right now, we are failing.

24:15.937 --> 24:18.249
We are failing Natalia,
and we are failing Elliot,

24:18.387 --> 24:20.251
and I don't know
what to do with that.

24:23.047 --> 24:27.224
The worst part of this job
is the powerlessness you feel

24:27.362 --> 24:29.260
when you know there is
nothing you can do.

24:29.398 --> 24:32.471
Yes, we could take her
back to the O.R.,

24:32.609 --> 24:35.439
but all we would be doing
is killing her faster.

24:37.924 --> 24:41.825
The best surgeons,
the best,

24:41.963 --> 24:44.483
learn how to live
with the worst part of this job.

25:01.361 --> 25:02.328
Ready?

25:02.466 --> 25:03.950
Ready.

25:04.088 --> 25:06.125
Wait. If I die--Barbara--

25:06.263 --> 25:08.783
If Carol can die from putting up
Super Bowl decorations,

25:08.921 --> 25:10.957
I can die
from brain surgery.

25:11.095 --> 25:14.789
If I die, do not let them
carry me in a box.

25:14.927 --> 25:17.585
I don't care. Let them
throw me out the car window.

25:18.620 --> 25:19.794
Okay.

25:26.766 --> 25:29.493
<i>Dr. Seip to oncology.
Dr. Seip, report to oncology.</i>

25:34.394 --> 25:36.500
Where's your preceptor?

25:36.638 --> 25:38.329
Gone.
He said he had what he needed.

25:38.467 --> 25:41.056
Ha. Yeah, was that
before or after

25:41.194 --> 25:45.544
you did an intracavitary
intubation in the E.R.?

25:46.993 --> 25:48.788
You know what, Bailey?

25:48.926 --> 25:51.204
I thrive on order and protocol.
I'm a solider.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.792
The chain of command
is in my bones,

25:52.930 --> 25:55.450
but I also know when to break
the rules to save the patient.

25:55.588 --> 25:56.865
My license
wasn't suspended

25:57.003 --> 25:58.280
because of my ability
to practice medicine.

25:58.418 --> 25:59.558
It was suspended because

25:59.696 --> 26:01.974
I fundamentally disagreed
with the law,

26:02.112 --> 26:03.907
because I did
what I thought was right.

26:04.045 --> 26:05.633
I want to get
my license back,

26:05.771 --> 26:07.876
and of course I want
to fix things with Teddy,

26:08.014 --> 26:10.569
but if I had done anything
differently today, that
patient would be dead.

26:10.707 --> 26:13.192
I did what I thought was
right, and I don't know how
to do this job any other way.

26:13.330 --> 26:16.022
Hey, none of those words
you just said

26:16.160 --> 26:18.887
is a thing that your wife
or any of us don't know.

26:19.025 --> 26:21.200
Have you tried apologizing

26:21.338 --> 26:24.065
for all of the things
that you got wrong

26:24.203 --> 26:27.689
instead of constantly defending
the things you got right?

26:32.245 --> 26:33.350
<i>Dr. Andorka to the NICU.</i>

26:35.007 --> 26:37.181
<i>Dr. Mary Andorka to the NICU.</i>

26:39.667 --> 26:42.221
Is he in
a lot of pain?

26:42.359 --> 26:43.878
I'm sorry.
And-- And you are?

26:44.016 --> 26:46.915
Gloria. Glow.
Gerald's wife.

26:47.053 --> 26:49.228
Oh, I wasn't aware
that he had called you.

26:49.366 --> 26:52.541
He didn't.
He has no idea I am here.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.233
I've--
I've known all along.

26:54.371 --> 26:55.959
He doesn't seem
to remember

26:56.097 --> 26:57.581
that I handle
all of our insurance payments.

26:57.719 --> 26:59.479
You never
said anything to him?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.792
I thought I should wait
until he was ready to tell me.

27:01.930 --> 27:04.450
And then months went by,
and he didn't,

27:04.588 --> 27:06.555
and I respect that.

27:06.694 --> 27:10.145
I respect his pride enough
to pretend.

27:10.283 --> 27:12.734
Well, the surgery
turned out beautifully.

27:12.872 --> 27:14.253
Thank you.

27:14.391 --> 27:16.255
Oh, you don't want to stay?
See him?

27:16.393 --> 27:19.776
I just needed to know
that he was going to be okay.

27:19.914 --> 27:21.432
I'll wait for his call.

31:10.972 --> 31:13.561
Are you happy?

31:13.699 --> 31:15.011
You know, I lost out
on a surgery today

31:15.149 --> 31:16.667
because you passed out.

31:16.805 --> 31:18.014
Then I had to drag
your sorry ass in here--

31:18.152 --> 31:19.429
heavier than it looks,
by the way--

31:19.567 --> 31:21.051
and, uh, babysit you.

31:21.189 --> 31:23.398
The way I see it,
you owe me.

31:23.536 --> 31:27.057
Fine. I will do your progress
notes for a week.

31:29.370 --> 31:31.441
Two weeks.

31:31.579 --> 31:33.339
What?

31:33.477 --> 31:36.066
Nothing. Just, uh,
sizing up the competition

31:36.204 --> 31:38.344
and liking my odds.

31:38.482 --> 31:40.933
Shut up.

31:49.183 --> 31:50.356
Did you get
all the tumor out?

31:50.494 --> 31:53.187
I did. And the pathology
report came back.

31:53.325 --> 31:56.259
It was a colloid cyst.
Your tumor is benign.

31:56.397 --> 31:59.779
- Say it again?
- Barbara doesn't have cancer.

32:04.888 --> 32:06.545
Oh, don't worry.
You'll get it.

32:06.683 --> 32:08.271
You still got time, huh?

32:08.409 --> 32:10.376
Yeah, you'll probably get
breast cancer like me,

32:10.514 --> 32:12.758
and then you can do a tummy tuck
when they do the mastectomy.

32:12.896 --> 32:14.346
I don't want cancer!

32:16.865 --> 32:19.938
And no matter what you say,
or how positively you say it,

32:20.076 --> 32:22.906
having cancer is not fun.

32:23.044 --> 32:24.735
Didi, you were exhausted
all the time,

32:24.873 --> 32:26.220
and I know you hated
losing your hair.

32:26.358 --> 32:28.049
You love your hair.

32:28.187 --> 32:30.362
And, Paula, I hated watching you
throw up all the time

32:30.500 --> 32:32.122
and then boast about
how skinny you were.

32:32.260 --> 32:34.021
I hate
everything about cancer.

32:34.159 --> 32:36.092
I don't want it,
I've never wanted it,

32:36.230 --> 32:39.026
and you need to stop making me
feel guilty for being healthy.

32:39.164 --> 32:42.132
I love you both so much,

32:42.270 --> 32:44.445
and I love
that you somehow turned

32:44.583 --> 32:47.689
the most horrible disease
that can happen to us

32:47.827 --> 32:49.657
into something positive.

32:51.555 --> 32:53.419
But I still don't want it.

32:58.114 --> 33:00.530
And you have to stop carrying
our dead sister around in a box.

33:00.668 --> 33:02.946
That is very weird.

33:03.084 --> 33:04.948
It is.

33:06.294 --> 33:09.642
We stay positive because,

33:09.780 --> 33:12.611
the truth is, it's the only way
we can deal with it, right?

33:12.749 --> 33:15.614
But you're right.
Cancer sucks.

33:15.752 --> 33:17.271
I hate cancer, too.

33:17.409 --> 33:18.824
And while we're telling
the truth,

33:18.962 --> 33:21.654
there's something else
you need to know.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.451
That's not Carol.
I left her in Reno in 2007.

33:25.589 --> 33:28.385
We've been carrying around
cat litter for 15 years.

33:35.772 --> 33:37.498
No. Stop it.

33:38.913 --> 33:40.501
Cat litter.
Stop it.

33:40.639 --> 33:41.778
Stop it.

33:47.749 --> 33:49.372
I heard what happened.

33:49.510 --> 33:50.683
I'm sorry.

33:52.754 --> 33:55.619
I am sorry that I made decisions
that affected your life,

33:55.757 --> 33:57.621
my life,
and the life of our kids.

33:57.759 --> 34:00.452
I'm sorry that we had
to flee to L.A.

34:00.590 --> 34:03.938
I'm sorry that I couldn't
bring myself to face it

34:04.076 --> 34:05.112
or even talk about it
with you,

34:05.250 --> 34:08.322
all the while
you supported our family.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.393
I'm sorry that my surfing
partner was attractive.

34:10.531 --> 34:13.189
You were right. I distracted
myself with her attentions,

34:13.327 --> 34:15.053
and then I pretended
like I wasn't doing that.

34:15.191 --> 34:17.883
I am sorry.

34:18.021 --> 34:20.023
I'm sorry for everything.

34:22.025 --> 34:25.028
Wait, stop.
It, um--

34:25.166 --> 34:27.513
It's my turn.

34:27.651 --> 34:29.377
I'm-- I'm also sorry.

34:29.515 --> 34:33.174
I'm-- I'm sorry
that I wasn't as supportive

34:33.312 --> 34:34.762
as I could have been
when you were struggling

34:34.900 --> 34:36.488
with the possibility
of losing your career.

34:36.626 --> 34:38.731
I'm sorry that instead
of talking to you,

34:38.869 --> 34:40.906
I chose to drink.

34:41.044 --> 34:42.942
I'm sorry
that instead of accepting

34:43.081 --> 34:44.944
that we are all
less than perfect,

34:45.083 --> 34:46.601
I chose to lash out,
and I'm sorry,

34:46.739 --> 34:49.087
because I know that nothing
you have ever done

34:49.225 --> 34:52.711
was meant to hurt me
or the kids or you

34:52.849 --> 34:55.265
or-- or our somewhat
chaotic life.

34:55.403 --> 34:59.338
You did it because you believed
it was right. And I love you.

34:59.476 --> 35:01.547
I always have,
and I always will.

35:03.825 --> 35:05.827
Also, um,
Dr. Patel called.

35:07.243 --> 35:10.453
And, um, you passed.

35:10.591 --> 35:13.421
And I would really love it
if you would return

35:13.559 --> 35:15.734
to chief of trauma
effective immediately.

35:18.702 --> 35:20.428
Congratulations.

35:20.566 --> 35:21.912
I would kiss you,
but I'm chief,

35:22.050 --> 35:24.018
and people can
see through the window.

35:26.676 --> 35:29.644
Did you never examine penises

35:29.782 --> 35:31.094
in the Caribbean?

35:31.232 --> 35:32.992
What about your
urology rotation?

35:33.131 --> 35:35.478
Once again,
it's not about the penis.

35:35.616 --> 35:38.377
I didn't expect that amount
of blood in the field

35:38.515 --> 35:39.827
and forgot
to eat breakfast.

35:39.965 --> 35:42.312
I saw you eat a bagel
and a sandwich.

35:44.797 --> 35:45.798
I don't want
to talk about it.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.697
Natalia died.

35:51.908 --> 35:54.807
I'm sorry.

35:54.945 --> 35:56.533
Yeah. Me, too.

35:58.294 --> 36:00.330

36:00.468 --> 36:02.505

36:13.309 --> 36:15.103
- No.
- He passed out in surgery--

36:15.242 --> 36:17.175
I meant, "No, I don't want
to talk about this."

36:18.624 --> 36:21.317
Uh, do you have
a problem with me?

36:21.455 --> 36:24.251
No, no.
Just had a long day.

36:24.389 --> 36:27.909
Really tired.
Didn't get any sleep last night.

36:28.047 --> 36:29.566
You sure that's it?

36:35.123 --> 36:36.815
Your fiancé's calling.

36:38.334 --> 36:41.820
Hey. Perfect timing.
Just got off my shift.

36:41.958 --> 36:43.684

Dr. Fox let me
place the graft,
