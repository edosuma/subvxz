WEBVTT

01:21.114 --> 01:23.817
Oh, glorious!
Homemade croissant.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.552
Just something I whipped up.

01:25.652 --> 01:26.753
Mmm!

01:26.853 --> 01:28.955
You know, over the years,
I have noticed an uptick

01:29.055 --> 01:31.558
in your baking triumphs
whenever a draft is proving...

01:31.658 --> 01:32.659
a challenge.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.027
No, it's going swimmingly!

01:34.127 --> 01:35.962
Hmm!
Terrific!

01:36.062 --> 01:37.430
Now, I'm wondering

01:37.530 --> 01:39.632
if you might want to meet
with some other writers.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.434
Oh, I don't have time.

01:41.534 --> 01:43.303
I'm writing too much
to mentor anyone.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.472
No, what I meant was
more of a consultation.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.440
You know,
to help expand your readership.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.809
I have a vast
and loyal readership.

01:49.909 --> 01:52.512
I am killing it
in the 40 to 85 demo.

01:52.612 --> 01:53.813
You said it yourself, Sarita.

01:53.913 --> 01:56.916
Yes, but darling,
this isn't me asking,

01:57.016 --> 02:00.286
it's the publisher,
who loves other demos, too...

02:00.386 --> 02:02.055
say 25 to 39?

02:02.155 --> 02:03.490
- Millennials?
- Mm-hm!

02:03.590 --> 02:04.757
Ugh, they don't even read!

02:04.858 --> 02:07.026
What are you talking about?
All we do is read.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.497
I am talking about books,
not Reddit!

02:10.597 --> 02:12.265
And what are you wearing, anyway?

02:12.365 --> 02:14.134
Slob-chic is not
a thing anymore.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.069
Look at those shoes!
What is happening?

02:16.169 --> 02:17.237
Oh, Darby!

02:17.337 --> 02:19.405
Shouldn't your mom
meet with younger authors,

02:19.506 --> 02:21.641
just to see if we might
refresh Bryn Martell

02:21.741 --> 02:24.844
for a younger audience?

02:24.944 --> 02:26.179
Definitely.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.947
- Good idea, Sarita.
- Thank you.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.883
You should try that, Mom.
You know, something new.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.786
Maybe it'll help
you stay relevant.

02:33.887 --> 02:34.854
Great!

02:34.954 --> 02:36.055
I'll set it up today.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.790
I have the perfect candidates.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.059
You have to keep
the publisher happy, love.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.327
Right?

02:43.229 --> 02:45.899
Hey, Antonio!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:47.100 --> 02:48.902
Whoa, whoa...
what's wrong?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.437
Oh, great,
now you're crying?

02:51.538 --> 02:54.440
Are you seriously crying
like a little girl right now?!

02:54.541 --> 02:59.012
I can't believe you!
What are you, stupid?

03:00.914 --> 03:03.516
Brain-dead or something?

03:03.616 --> 03:05.885
This is a workplace!

03:05.985 --> 03:07.053
Can you hear me?

03:07.153 --> 03:09.822
This is
a professional workplace!

03:09.923 --> 03:12.158
And you've got
no business being here

03:12.258 --> 03:14.694
if you can't take the heat!

03:18.698 --> 03:21.067
What are you doing?!

03:24.404 --> 03:26.940
That never happened.
That-- that's not me.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.509
I-I would never say
stuff like that.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.844
Okay.

03:31.945 --> 03:32.979
This could kill me.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.682
We've only been in business
for eight months.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.584
How can anybody even fake this?

03:37.684 --> 03:41.387
I'll send it to Alastair.
I'll get us answers ASAP.

03:41.487 --> 03:44.224
Oh my God...

03:44.324 --> 03:45.525
The review!

03:45.625 --> 03:48.027
We're getting
our first major review

03:48.127 --> 03:49.762
by Alder Bluffs Life
next week.

03:49.862 --> 03:52.098
If any of this ends up there,
it's over.

03:52.198 --> 03:54.067
Don't worry.
I've got your back.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.535
I'll help you figure this out.

03:55.635 --> 03:56.736
Absolutely.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.038
We will help you
figure this out.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.139
Thank you.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.207
Thank you both.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.810
I-I didn't know
who else to turn to.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.612
Oh, no, Zane is here!

04:05.712 --> 04:06.980
Hannah, go distract him!

04:07.080 --> 04:10.149
Okay, we cannot
tell him about this.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.185
Nobody.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.654
Why on Earth not?

04:14.754 --> 04:18.057
Because Zane is so...
protective!

04:18.157 --> 04:19.892
You know he will go overboard.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.728
He will, you know, interfere.

04:21.828 --> 04:22.929
Oh, definitely.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.732
Zane is extra when
his loved ones are threatened.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.066
It's intense.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.167
Hey!

04:28.268 --> 04:29.402
Hi!

04:29.502 --> 04:31.904
Did I miss the group text
about a team lunch?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.406
Oh, no, no, no.
We just...

04:33.506 --> 04:35.475
We came in to "hi,"
and... we did!

04:35.575 --> 04:37.010
- So, now we're saying "bye."
- Yeah!

04:37.110 --> 04:38.311
- There you go!
- Thank you.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.780
I have to go to...

04:40.880 --> 04:42.315
- The hairdresser.
- A new client.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.850
Both.
The...

04:43.950 --> 04:45.251
She cuts my hair.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.287
Yeah, it's a mystery 'cause
her scissors keep getting lost,

04:47.387 --> 04:48.421
so we've just gonna...

04:48.521 --> 04:50.423
Solve it. Goodbye!
Okay, have a good day!

04:50.523 --> 04:51.691
- Okay.
- Bye!

04:51.791 --> 04:53.159
Alright, off you go!

04:53.259 --> 04:56.729
Protect... and serve!

04:56.829 --> 04:58.665
Right.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.900
Okay.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.893
I can't believe you.
What are you, stupid?

05:26.993 --> 05:29.862
That is definitely a deepfake.

05:29.962 --> 05:31.731
You see how
the facial hair is smudged,

05:31.831 --> 05:32.965
especially under the chin?

05:33.066 --> 05:34.701
And the shark eyes.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.836
- Very Uncanny Valley.
- But how was it made?

05:36.936 --> 05:39.339
The artificial intelligence
pulls video, pictures,

05:39.439 --> 05:42.208
audio samples, and then creates
forgeries from that data set.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.543
Check it out.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.978
[video] Here it is.
My beautiful kitchen.

05:46.079 --> 05:49.716
Just had the range installed.
Yes!

05:49.816 --> 05:52.218
- I remember that.
- Yeah, we've seen that one.

05:52.318 --> 05:55.321
But that video was posted
prior to the bistro's opening.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.589
Mm-hm.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.459
Between this and the other
videos he's posted online,

05:59.559 --> 06:02.061
I think Antonio gave the perp
exactly what he needed

06:02.161 --> 06:05.498
to create the deepfake.

06:05.598 --> 06:08.668
I'm so sorry...
Do you want something?

06:08.768 --> 06:10.570
Like, you know,
some Italian sparkling water?

06:10.670 --> 06:12.705
Oh, yes!
You know me well!

06:12.805 --> 06:14.107
- Thank you so much!
- Okay.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.008
Yeah, I'm a little thirsty, too.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.478
Excuse me.

06:18.578 --> 06:21.381
So who has
this kind of technology?

06:21.481 --> 06:22.782
Hacker collectives?

06:22.882 --> 06:24.450
Russian troll farms?

06:24.550 --> 06:25.585
Well, yeah, maybe.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.920
Um, or, you know,
someone with a smartphone.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.555
You know,
some time and creativity.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.858
Well, that could
literally be anybody!

06:31.958 --> 06:34.861
Yes, which makes it
incredibly difficult to trace.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.763
Yeah,
but who would benefit

06:36.863 --> 06:38.865
from ruining Antonio's
reputation?

06:38.965 --> 06:41.467
A neighbouring competitor?
An angry neighbour?

06:41.567 --> 06:43.569
Hey, Antonio,
did you have a neighbour

06:43.669 --> 06:45.371
who complained about the bistro?

06:45.471 --> 06:46.939
It's so good!

06:47.039 --> 06:49.442
Uh-huh.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.210
Okay, sounds good.

06:51.310 --> 06:52.879
His next-door neighbour
complained to the city

06:52.979 --> 06:54.714
when he applied
to expand the patio.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.149
He's gonna text me the name.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.718
Well, that sounds promising!
Let's go.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.086
Thank you so much.

07:00.186 --> 07:04.857
Anytime, Victoria.
And I will keep digging.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.864
"Anytime, Victoria.
And I will keep digging."

07:11.964 --> 07:12.999
Idiot!

07:17.703 --> 07:19.806
Okay, neighbour's
name is Clive,

07:19.906 --> 07:21.641
and apparently
he had a temper tantrum

07:21.741 --> 07:23.209
at a public
consultation meeting.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.144
- Augh!
- I take it that's Clive.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.646
He looks angry.

07:26.746 --> 07:27.880
If he gets belligerent,

07:27.980 --> 07:31.117
I'm gonna hide behind you
like a human shield.

07:32.852 --> 07:33.886
Hello, Clive!

07:33.986 --> 07:35.121
Stupid piece of crap!

07:35.221 --> 07:36.422
Clive, uh...?

07:36.522 --> 07:37.990
Are-- are you Clive?
Hello?

07:38.090 --> 07:39.325
Yeah, who wants to know?!

07:39.425 --> 07:40.560
Hi.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.229
We're following up on
the public consultation meeting,

07:43.329 --> 07:45.631
for the bistro's
back patio permit.

07:45.731 --> 07:48.868
You had some concerns?

07:50.069 --> 07:51.671
You heard about that?

07:51.771 --> 07:53.639
Oh, man, I'm totally
embarrassed!

07:53.739 --> 07:55.141
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.543
Once Antonio actually
had the patio going,

07:57.643 --> 07:59.111
he put up
noise-cancelling baffles,

07:59.212 --> 08:01.481
he kept the music
and the hours reasonable.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.449
He even put up a suggestion box

08:03.549 --> 08:05.218
on his website
to keep up with feedback.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.720
- Sounds like Antonio, alright.
- Yeah!

08:07.820 --> 08:09.355
And I'm in anger management.

08:09.455 --> 08:11.958
Oh, good for you.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.326
Although it's...

08:13.426 --> 08:14.827
early days.

08:14.927 --> 08:16.028
Is that so?

08:16.128 --> 08:17.396
I'm a regular of Antonio's now.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.965
I'd feel terrible if he knew

08:19.065 --> 08:20.833
I was once dead set
against the patio.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.401
Me and some buddies
are even talking about

08:22.502 --> 08:23.903
starting a trivia night there.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.405
Oh! Well, we'd hate
to ruin that kind of fun,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.407
so... just carry on!

08:28.508 --> 08:30.009
Nice to meet you.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.011
Okay, I have to go home.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.246
What?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.580
We're just getting started.

08:34.680 --> 08:39.752
You're the one who thinks
I need a Millennial consultant.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.656
...with onion and garlic
to seal the grain in.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.392
Only then do we add the boiling
water-- so glad you like it!

08:46.492 --> 08:47.927
So sorry to interrupt!

08:48.027 --> 08:49.195
- Any luck?
- No!

08:49.295 --> 08:51.531
Your neighbour, Clive,
he's your biggest fan now.

08:51.631 --> 08:54.567
So maybe don't let him know that
you knew about the complaint.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.668
Got it.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.737
- Who else would have done this?
- I don't know.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.072
Do you have a rival
or a jealous ex?

09:00.172 --> 09:01.173
No.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.608
Did you have a major
falling out with somebody

09:02.708 --> 09:04.477
that I don't know about
for some weird reason?

09:04.577 --> 09:05.678
Wait...

09:05.778 --> 09:07.880
I know somebody who might
hate me enough to do this!

09:07.980 --> 09:09.348
Oh, that's...

09:09.448 --> 09:10.583
good news?

09:10.683 --> 09:12.351
Well, no, but...

09:12.451 --> 09:13.319
It's Randy!

09:13.419 --> 09:14.520
- Randy?
- Yeah.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.223
Yeah, Randy was the old
head chef at La Camargue.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.891
Oh, the place in Hamilton
where you worked

09:18.991 --> 09:20.192
- before you opened this one?
- Exactly.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.161
I've got time before
the dinner rush starts,

09:22.261 --> 09:24.297
so let's go there now
and see if anybody knows

09:24.397 --> 09:26.198
what happened to him.
We can take my car.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.600
Yeah.
Alright, see you out front.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.568
Okay.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.507
What the hell?

09:40.279 --> 09:42.715
It's such a treat to meet
with another writer

09:42.815 --> 09:45.284
and just... chat,
peer to peer.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.086
Oh!
Well, not exactly

09:47.186 --> 09:49.622
peer to peer, but yes,
it's... it is nice.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.057
Anyways, I've
whipped together

09:51.157 --> 09:54.060
a comprehensive data analysis
of all your books.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.295
Every Bryn Martell book
has been tracked.

09:56.395 --> 09:57.630
Oh!

09:57.730 --> 10:01.601
Results show she often
solves the case in the same way.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.836
Well, there is
a bit of a pattern

10:03.936 --> 10:07.106
in the structure
of a mystery novel...

10:07.206 --> 10:10.076
Or you could just
do... better.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.277
Here's the pitch!

10:11.377 --> 10:14.213
Bryn Martell is just
graduating from college!

10:14.313 --> 10:15.648
So she's a mature student?

10:15.748 --> 10:18.451
No.
She's, like, 22.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.519
Twenty-two?
Um... why?

10:20.620 --> 10:24.323
Because then people
would care about her.

10:24.423 --> 10:25.825
Wow.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.430
I don't know...

10:31.530 --> 10:34.066
Maybe Bryn's inaccessible
to a younger audience

10:34.166 --> 10:37.336
because she's so...

10:37.436 --> 10:39.105
...privileged?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.311
Hey, Jake!

10:45.411 --> 10:46.479
Antonio!

10:46.579 --> 10:48.814
Oh, man,
it is so good to see you again.

10:48.914 --> 10:49.849
Good to see you, too.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.350
Oh, and you came
at the perfect time.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.352
Like, lunch and dinner rushes
have been crazy.

10:53.452 --> 10:54.453
Good, good!

10:54.553 --> 10:55.788
So tell me, who's EC now?

10:55.888 --> 10:57.156
Executive chef.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.557
I had to step in.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.960
But I am no Antonio Pereira.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.161
Come off it!

11:02.261 --> 11:03.295
He's just being humble.

11:03.396 --> 11:07.033
No, no, no!
This guy here, a legend.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.567
I mean,
we had reservations

11:08.668 --> 11:09.735
literally months in advance!

11:09.835 --> 11:11.971
Celebrities coming in,
Antonio's winning awards

11:12.071 --> 11:13.973
- all over the place!
- Oh, stop!

11:14.073 --> 11:15.841
Oh my God, hi!

11:15.941 --> 11:17.643
- Oh, excuse me.
- Yeah.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.178
How are you?

11:19.278 --> 11:22.715
So Jake, I don't know
if you saw it or heard about it,

11:22.815 --> 11:25.551
but there was a deepfake video
online that targeted Antonio.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.720
Yeah, yeah,
one of the staff showed me.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.321
But there's
no way that's Antonio!

11:29.422 --> 11:31.090
Oh, believe me, I know.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.226
Um, we're actually looking
into an ex-employee of yours,

11:34.326 --> 11:36.562
Randy Weisbrock.

11:36.662 --> 11:37.963
Do you remember that guy?

11:38.064 --> 11:39.265
Randy...

11:39.365 --> 11:40.900
Do you happen to have
a forwarding address for him?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.368
Yeah, of course.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.070
You don't think
it could be him, do you?

11:44.170 --> 11:47.540
Maybe.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.375
Were you the one
who fired Randy?

11:49.475 --> 11:50.943
Yeah.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.714
Yeah, I took my eye off the ball
and didn't see how toxic

11:54.814 --> 11:56.816
the culture in the kitchen
had become under him.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.884
What was he like?

11:58.984 --> 12:00.686
Well, let's just say
that Randy got away with

12:00.786 --> 12:02.555
a lot of bad behaviour
for too long.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.556
And then...?

12:03.656 --> 12:05.725
When I hired Antonio,
he was clear:

12:05.825 --> 12:07.393
the culture needed to change.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.096
Harassment seminars,
more female chefs.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.698
Randy fought it
and he got pushed out.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.934
Antonio took his place as EC.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.870
So, Randy blamed Antonio
for everything.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.239
Doesn't surprise me
that he'd still have a grudge.

12:20.339 --> 12:24.076
Ah, here we go.

12:24.176 --> 12:27.480
I didn't think that Randy was
a very tech-savvy kind of guy,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.381
but I do remember him saying

12:29.482 --> 12:33.385
he was gonna make Antonio pay.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.888
Thank you.

12:37.423 --> 12:37.757
course I'm writing!

12:39.458 --> 12:40.860
What else do
you think I'm doing?

12:40.960 --> 12:41.961
Great.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.497
Because the publishers
are being so difficult...

12:44.597 --> 12:46.065
since they haven't
seen any pages.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.300
Well...
I have my process!

12:48.400 --> 12:50.336
Hey, I have
an incredible opportunity.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.739
Sheldon Marcasczy is stopping
in Toronto on his book tour.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.308
How about you set aside
some time and meet with him?

12:56.408 --> 12:58.477
The Langum Prize,
Washington Irving Medal,

12:58.577 --> 13:00.446
Pulitzer-Prize-winning
Sheldon Marcasczy?

13:00.546 --> 13:02.448
Isn't he more of
a historical novelist?

13:02.548 --> 13:03.682
Mm-hm!

13:03.783 --> 13:06.285
Well, I'm not writing
a 500-page novel about Iwo Jima!

13:06.385 --> 13:08.687
He's in town.
And he's a powerhouse.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.122
His agent owes me a favour.

13:10.222 --> 13:11.457
He'll do it.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.259
Will you?

13:13.359 --> 13:15.861
Okay, fine, if you stop
making me take these meetings!

13:15.961 --> 13:18.063
I promise.
I'll leave you alone.

13:18.164 --> 13:19.832
But you will be
calling to thank me.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.133
Doubtful.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.868
Oh, that's Darby.
I have to meet her.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.471
Byeee!

13:32.611 --> 13:34.180
Hey, Antonio.
Where's Darby?

13:34.280 --> 13:35.381
Oh, she's inside.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.817
She thought she might
get more out of Randy

13:37.917 --> 13:39.351
if she talked to him alone.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.854
: Hmm,
not her worst idea.

13:41.954 --> 13:42.822
Right!

13:42.922 --> 13:44.089
See you in a minute.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.524
Are you seriously crying

13:45.624 --> 13:47.359
like a little girl right now?

13:47.459 --> 13:50.229
This is a professional
workplace!

13:50.329 --> 13:53.532
And you've got no business being
here if you can't take the heat!

13:53.632 --> 13:55.568
Pretty sweet.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.903
Sucks to be him, I guess.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.138
Karma's a bitch.

13:59.238 --> 14:00.773
So you had nothing
to do with it?

14:00.873 --> 14:01.874
No, but thanks.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.309
Made my day.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.411
I'd just glad somebody
revealed that weasel

14:05.511 --> 14:07.379
for what he truly is.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.281
Antonio stole my job,

14:09.381 --> 14:11.250
then he wouldn't
give me a reference.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.451
I couldn't work anywhere

14:12.551 --> 14:13.853
that didn't have
chicken fingers on the menu.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.721
- Is that what I smell?
- Screw him.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.022
And screw you, too, lady.

14:17.122 --> 14:18.424
Very charming.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.926
Seems to me your getting
fired wasn't Antonio's fault.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.262
And that is not my fault.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.731
But what's great about it
is that he's finally

14:25.831 --> 14:30.336
getting a taste of what it's
like to be hated by everybody.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.613
Well, I appreciate
you both coming with me

14:40.713 --> 14:42.081
on that wild goose chase.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.283
Yeah, I wish
I would've stayed with you

14:44.383 --> 14:46.719
in the parking lot.
I cannot unsee that.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.454
I think we should
tell Zane what's up.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.056
No!
No, no, no, I can't do that.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.626
Okay, listen:
we are over-leveraged

14:53.726 --> 14:55.461
on our investment
in the restaurant

14:55.561 --> 14:59.098
and I may not have given Zane
the full scope of how bad it is.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.933
- Really?!
- I know, I know, I'm horrible,

15:01.033 --> 15:04.937
but listen-- Zane is already
feeling anxious about it.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.407
If he gets involved with this,
he will go overboard.

15:08.507 --> 15:09.441
Guaranteed.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.076
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:11.176 --> 15:13.712
Your staff was wondering
where you disappeared to.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.748
Uh...
Oh, look at that!

15:15.848 --> 15:18.951
I am, uh, late for the...

15:19.051 --> 15:20.085
dinner prep!

15:20.185 --> 15:22.821
I...
See you later!

15:22.922 --> 15:24.323
So, where did you go?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.724
- A local...
- The farmer's market.

15:25.824 --> 15:28.928
...beekeeper's
to get wild honey.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.096
- At the farmer's market.
- Yeah.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.232
At the farmer's
market, where it was fun.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.367
They had a stand.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.570
Okay.
Well, I hope it was worth it.

15:41.407 --> 15:44.643
It was.

15:56.221 --> 15:59.258
Bryn Martell walked

15:59.358 --> 16:00.492
happil--

16:05.130 --> 16:07.399
She stormed...

16:11.603 --> 16:14.473
Crept silently...

16:14.573 --> 16:17.176
Ugh!

16:31.757 --> 16:34.760
Perfect.
There you go.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.061
Antonio?

16:36.161 --> 16:37.529
- Antonio, hi.
- Yes?

16:37.629 --> 16:39.298
I need you to come
see something in the kitchen.

16:39.398 --> 16:40.766
- Yes, just a second, Hannah.
- No--

16:40.866 --> 16:41.867
Oh, Table 14
needs some champagne.

16:41.967 --> 16:43.369
- Could you handle that, please?
- No, I can't.

16:43.469 --> 16:44.603
- It's really important.
- Hi!

16:44.703 --> 16:46.271
- Seriously, come see this.
- Hannah, I will get to you.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.574
Whatever it is, I'm pretty sure
it can wait some more minutes.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.275
No, it can't, it can't.

17:02.621 --> 17:03.655
Uh...

17:03.756 --> 17:05.357
Oh, that is disgusting.

17:05.457 --> 17:09.728
Folks, I am so sorry
for this disruption.

17:09.828 --> 17:10.896
I can assure you that

17:10.996 --> 17:13.232
we're talking care
of everything, okay?

17:13.332 --> 17:15.634
Just enjoy your meals.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.236
Please.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.213
Let's go!

17:42.895 --> 17:44.763
How did
the rats get in?

17:44.863 --> 17:46.598
I've never had
a rat problem before.

17:46.698 --> 17:48.133
Well, this fresh air vent

17:48.233 --> 17:50.235
is supposed to have
a mesh screen thingy.

17:50.335 --> 17:51.703
That's probably how they got in.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.839
No, no, no, no,
this doesn't make any sense!

17:53.939 --> 17:55.941
I just had my mid-year
inspection last month.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.477
That's the kind of thing that
the Health Inspector checks,

17:58.577 --> 17:59.745
and it was fine then!

17:59.845 --> 18:01.814
Look, I don't
know what to tell you, man.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.415
I've laid down some traps,

18:03.515 --> 18:05.284
I'll come by and check
on them tomorrow, okay?

18:05.384 --> 18:07.286
The mesh screen thingy--
does it look like this?

18:07.386 --> 18:08.587
Yeah, exactly.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.456
Well, what's it doing
all the way over here?

18:10.556 --> 18:12.391
Looks like someone
took it from there

18:12.491 --> 18:15.127
and put it over there
on purpose.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.896
Will you give me a call
after you check the traps?

18:17.996 --> 18:21.400
Oh, for sure!
Yeah, I'll give you a call...

18:21.500 --> 18:24.636
No, but, like... 'cause
I want to know about the rats.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.438
- Rats?
- Yeah.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.073
Got it.

18:28.173 --> 18:30.709
No, but-- ugh!

18:30.809 --> 18:33.145
You really thought I wouldn't
learn about the deepfake?

18:33.245 --> 18:36.181
The debunked deepfake.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.183
I'm just gonna
give you some space.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.019
And now I'm guessing the same
person that got you closed down

18:41.120 --> 18:42.321
is trying to ruin
your credibility

18:42.421 --> 18:43.388
with a rat infestation?

18:43.489 --> 18:44.623
I think so.
I'm sorry, Zane.

18:44.723 --> 18:45.824
- Why would you hide this?
- I--

18:45.924 --> 18:47.526
I'm not even gonna start
with you two!

18:47.626 --> 18:48.660
It wasn't me.

18:48.760 --> 18:53.031
It was 100% Darby's idea
to not tell you.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.334
- I can't believe you.
- What?!

18:55.434 --> 18:56.735
Why would you say that?

18:56.835 --> 18:58.871
I don't know,
to try something new,

18:58.971 --> 19:00.572
be honest, be relevant?

19:00.672 --> 19:02.341
If this is about yesterday,
you started it!

19:02.441 --> 19:03.475
You called me a slob.

19:03.575 --> 19:05.811
Don't you have some
famous author to go meet?

19:05.911 --> 19:07.679
Zane!
Where are you going?

19:07.779 --> 19:09.181
I'm looking for evidence.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.682
Sir,
you forgot your... box!

19:10.782 --> 19:11.884
Zane, I'm sorry, okay?

19:11.984 --> 19:14.153
I wanted to tell you,
but Antonio asked me not to.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.688
He said that you might
worry because, you know,

19:16.788 --> 19:17.956
you do tend to...

19:18.056 --> 19:21.059
overreact when the people
you care about are threatened.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.261
No, I don't.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.863
Grade 10.
Brian Colossi.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.533
You trapped him in
a bathroom stall with duct tape.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.968
That's because he dumped you!

19:36.542 --> 19:40.212
Yeah, well, maybe Antonio
was onto something.

19:49.621 --> 19:50.923
That's weird.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.759
I thought Antonio sent
everyone home already.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.095
Let's see where she goes.

19:58.597 --> 20:01.667
Well, it's an honour
to meet you, Sheldon.

20:01.767 --> 20:05.270
Sarita tells me that you
may be able to provide

20:05.370 --> 20:07.873
some insight as to how
I could appeal to Millennials.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.074
Oh, Millennials.

20:09.174 --> 20:10.776
Throw in a past trauma
and climate change,

20:10.876 --> 20:11.977
you got a bestseller!

20:12.077 --> 20:13.912
Nice place
if you like frou-frou.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.582
- You got any coffee?
- Yes.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.450
So I hear
you got a problem, Vicki.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.886
Uh, the name is Victoria.

20:20.986 --> 20:22.187
Your output.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.622
Terrible.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.224
Uh...
Right.

20:25.324 --> 20:28.227
Well, I've only
written 44 novels.

20:28.327 --> 20:29.661
Look, don't
get down on yourself.

20:29.761 --> 20:32.397
You can still turn it around.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.267
And you?
Many significant awards,

20:35.367 --> 20:38.237
but you've written, what,
eight, nine books?

20:38.337 --> 20:40.072
Eight.
Under Sheldon Marcasczy.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.441
But then there's
my nom de plume--

20:42.541 --> 20:44.910
Shandra Mabrey.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.412
You're Shandra Mabrey?

20:47.512 --> 20:51.617
The best-selling
thriller novelist?!

20:51.717 --> 20:53.151
Well, bravo.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.886
No kidding.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.159
Hannah was the one
who saw the rats first.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.794
Now she's sneaking around
the restaurant

21:02.894 --> 21:03.895
when it's supposed to be empty?

21:03.996 --> 21:06.164
She had the key.
She could have planted the rats.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.566
Exactly!

21:07.666 --> 21:11.303
See, you could be
an honorary Spencer Sister.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.243
Hello!
Who's this now?

21:22.414 --> 21:24.583
See, this is why
surveillance is creepy.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.318
Yeah.

21:30.889 --> 21:32.124
Okay, Vicki...

21:32.224 --> 21:33.825
What are the five things
you need to know

21:33.925 --> 21:35.360
to get to work on your novel?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.195
Uh, it's Victoria, and...

21:37.296 --> 21:39.531
"Character, Setting,
Problem, Plot, Solution"!

21:39.631 --> 21:41.466
Wrong!
Boring.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.337
Okay.
What?

21:45.437 --> 21:47.773
Here's what's important--

21:47.873 --> 21:48.974
money.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.043
Oh, I don't really handle that.
My agent does.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.546
I'm quite comfortable.
I write for love, not money.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.148
No, no, no.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.416
M.O.N.E.Y.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.152
It's a mnemonic
to remember the following.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.720
Misfortune.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.488
What's your character's
problem, flaw?

22:03.588 --> 22:05.724
Something your judgey readers

22:05.824 --> 22:08.360
would like to make them
feel superior.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.162
Orgasms.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.530
Are they having any?

22:11.630 --> 22:13.065
Nifty Gizmos.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.101
What cool tools are they
using to solve the problem?

22:16.201 --> 22:17.936
A direct line to the Pentagon?

22:18.036 --> 22:19.571
A flamethrower in a lipstick?

22:19.671 --> 22:21.106
Envy.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.875
What do the characters have
that the readers will envy?

22:23.975 --> 22:25.510
A jawline that cuts diamonds?

22:25.610 --> 22:26.678
Legs for days?

22:26.778 --> 22:29.548
A yoga instructor
lover in Tahiti?

22:29.648 --> 22:31.483
That would cover off O as well.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.418
Yahoo!

22:33.518 --> 22:38.890
What do they do that makes
the reader say, "Yahoo!"...

22:38.990 --> 22:41.927
in the end?

22:42.027 --> 22:45.430
Well, um, Sheldon,
I don't really have the answers

22:45.530 --> 22:47.799
to any of those things
right this second.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.735
That's your problem.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.971
My problem is I'm too prolific.

22:53.071 --> 22:55.874
That's why I'm constantly
reinventing myself.

22:55.974 --> 22:59.678
As Shandra Mabrey,
as Shane Massimo--

22:59.778 --> 23:01.480
You're Shane Massimo, too?

23:01.580 --> 23:03.248
Of the Jack Hogan franchise?

23:03.348 --> 23:05.851
Yeah.
Just inked a new trilogy deal.

23:05.951 --> 23:07.786
Whoa.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.255
Well, I don't think your system
would work for me, honestly.

23:10.355 --> 23:12.557
I start with a spark,
an inspiration.

23:12.657 --> 23:13.759
I see that.

23:13.859 --> 23:15.560
I just read your
last three books.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.529
You could really use
some inspiration.

23:17.629 --> 23:18.864
Hmph!

23:20.432 --> 23:23.602
Okay...

23:23.702 --> 23:26.238
Okay.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.839
So she doesn't
have a criminal record,

23:27.939 --> 23:31.643
but she did get a suspicious
parking ticket yesterday.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.279
Wait, does that say
"heating needs"?

23:34.379 --> 23:36.915
It's an HVAC company.

23:37.015 --> 23:39.985
She got the guy to put
the rats in the ventilation!

23:40.085 --> 23:42.988
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Zane!

23:43.088 --> 23:45.991
Zane?

23:46.091 --> 23:48.927
Zane!

23:49.027 --> 23:50.929
Hey, Hannah!

23:51.029 --> 23:52.364
Hey, Zane.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.599
Darby...
What... are you doing here?

23:54.699 --> 23:56.601
- Who's the HVAC guy?
- Yeah.

23:56.701 --> 23:57.836
Were you spying on me?

23:57.936 --> 24:00.605
- No.
- Yes.

24:00.705 --> 24:01.907
Oh, okay.

24:02.007 --> 24:04.276
Well, the HVAC guy
is my boyfriend,

24:04.376 --> 24:08.079
and I was just asking if maybe
he could get an inspection

24:08.180 --> 24:10.315
for Antonio, to see
if there any more rats.

24:10.415 --> 24:11.516
Don't buy it.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.084
Why were you sneaking
out of the restaurant

24:13.185 --> 24:14.286
after Antonio
sent everyone home?

24:14.386 --> 24:16.855
I wasn't sneaking, I was
returning a bottle of wine!

24:16.955 --> 24:20.492
- That you stole?
- No, I was just...

24:20.592 --> 24:22.794
I was getting together with
some friends and I borrowed

24:22.894 --> 24:24.496
a bottle of wine
from the wine rack.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.398
But I bought a new one.
I returned it.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.133
- I have the receipt.
- There's more.

24:28.233 --> 24:31.503
You in the habit of
not paying parking tickets?

24:31.603 --> 24:32.771
I just got that yesterday!

24:32.871 --> 24:36.374
And the parking spot was
in front of a Humane Society.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.711
Maybe that's where
you got some rats... huh?

24:41.913 --> 24:46.218
Yeah, that's what I thought.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.887
I had to put my cat down.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.689
Oh, no, Zane.

24:50.789 --> 24:53.058
I think we're "duct tape
in the bathroom" territory.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.893
You guys think I did this?

24:54.993 --> 24:57.496
I can't believe this!
I defended Antonio!

24:57.596 --> 24:58.830
No, no!

24:58.930 --> 25:02.367
You can tell him I quit!

25:11.243 --> 25:12.944
Hello.

25:13.044 --> 25:15.046
You seem to be feeling...

25:15.146 --> 25:16.114
stabby.

25:16.214 --> 25:17.716
I just needed an outlet.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.484
There's a reason
why stabbing victims

25:19.584 --> 25:21.253
are never stabbed just once.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.554
Okay...?

25:22.654 --> 25:26.124
Feels too good
for the stabber to stop.

25:26.224 --> 25:27.559
Right...

25:27.659 --> 25:29.261
So how was the famous author?

25:29.361 --> 25:33.298
Oh, opinionated
about my new manuscript.

25:33.398 --> 25:36.468
Whoa, that's a lot of
crossed out words.

25:36.568 --> 25:37.969
What are all the Z's for?

25:38.069 --> 25:41.306
It's for every time
he said he went to sleep.

25:41.406 --> 25:43.441
Why didn't you tell
this guy to take a hike?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.710
You were happy to get rid
of all the Millennials.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.712
Because I'm stuck.

25:47.812 --> 25:51.650
My last two novels were flops
and I'm afraid that's it!

25:51.750 --> 25:54.786
Ride's over!

25:54.886 --> 25:57.556
I'm not relevant anymore.

26:01.159 --> 26:02.861
Unless you're making
a watermelon smoothie,

26:02.961 --> 26:05.297
I think you can...
stop with the chopping.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.867
You know what, I've had
enough criticism for today,

26:08.967 --> 26:10.135
especially from you.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.170
I wasn't criticizing, Mom.

26:14.773 --> 26:17.275
Oof, not good.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.860
Hey, I thought you finished
your shift a while ago.

26:35.961 --> 26:39.197
Where were you?

26:39.297 --> 26:42.000
Darby and I went
to talk to Hannah.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.135
And...

26:44.235 --> 26:46.304
she might have quit.

26:46.404 --> 26:48.873
Oh my God, Zane!

26:48.974 --> 26:50.175
That's it, that's it.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.811
This day could not
get any worse.

26:52.911 --> 26:54.012
It's gonna be okay.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.747
Well, is it?

26:55.847 --> 26:59.651
Babe, we just suddenly
lost one income,

26:59.751 --> 27:00.885
and I don't know for how long.

27:00.986 --> 27:02.954
And now we've got interest
on the bank loan

27:03.054 --> 27:05.924
and our mortgage, daycare.

27:10.095 --> 27:13.398
We might have to sell the condo.

27:13.498 --> 27:16.668
What?

27:16.768 --> 27:18.737
It can't be that bad.

27:18.837 --> 27:23.441
Yeah, um...
the thing is, I...

27:23.541 --> 27:26.511
kind of maxed out
the line of credit

27:26.611 --> 27:28.346
when I was doing
the patio reno.

27:28.446 --> 27:30.281
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry.

27:30.382 --> 27:33.251
But now with the interest,
there's no way that we can...

27:38.089 --> 27:41.693
This was all just
a huge mistake.

27:45.296 --> 27:48.566
Keeping the truth
from me was a mistake.

27:52.904 --> 27:55.707
But the bistro...

27:55.807 --> 27:57.776
it's your dream.

27:57.876 --> 28:01.780
I love that you're ambitious,
that you take risks.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.817
Well, maybe
I'm reconsidering that one.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.820
Maybe we can ask my parents
for a loan in the meantime.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.523
No.
No, no, no, I can't do that.

28:11.623 --> 28:12.957
I can't.
I'm sorry, there's no way.

28:13.058 --> 28:17.462
So it's better for us, for our
daughter, to lose her home?

28:17.562 --> 28:20.565
You might have to
let go of your pride.

28:20.665 --> 28:23.101
- My pride?
- Yeah.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.636
This-- it's not my pride.

28:24.736 --> 28:27.739
It's...
this is my responsibi--

28:27.839 --> 28:31.876
You know what?
I need to get some fresh air.

28:51.262 --> 28:53.732
Darby Spencer.

28:53.832 --> 28:56.134
Brendon?

28:56.234 --> 28:58.169
Oh, rat guy!

29:02.173 --> 29:06.311
Brendon, you know, I'm really
just not into dating right now.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.450
No, my sister
is not available either.

29:12.550 --> 29:15.887
How about those rats, Brendon?

29:18.623 --> 29:20.658
Can we talk about it
on the phone?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.528
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.

29:23.628 --> 29:25.163
Uh...

29:25.263 --> 29:27.432
Okay, "Misfortune."

29:27.532 --> 29:30.368
"Bryn has been
struck by malaria,

29:30.468 --> 29:33.471
"but must still learn
who's behind the tiger poaching

29:33.571 --> 29:35.673
"in the Serengeti."

29:35.774 --> 29:37.041
"Orgasm."

29:39.244 --> 29:41.513
The rats from the bistro
are Norway rats.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.448
They're clean,
they're domesticated--

29:43.548 --> 29:45.216
If you want a pet,
the answer is no.

29:45.316 --> 29:47.185
- It's always been no.
- The rat guy called!

29:47.285 --> 29:48.987
Oh, my future son-in-law?

29:49.087 --> 29:50.722
We're eloping;
you're not invited.

29:50.822 --> 29:53.458
He said the rats that normally
infest buildings around here

29:53.558 --> 29:54.526
are black rats.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.827
Which means these rats--

29:55.927 --> 29:59.430
Are from a store
or an animal shelter!

30:04.302 --> 30:07.472
Okay, let's hope
this is lucky number 11.

30:07.572 --> 30:10.008
Excuse me, do you sell rats?

30:10.108 --> 30:11.509
Uh, live or frozen?

30:11.609 --> 30:12.944
I'm getting tired
of saying this, but,

30:13.044 --> 30:14.746
live rats, please!

30:14.846 --> 30:16.447
Uh, what kind of snake
do you have?

30:16.548 --> 30:19.284
Do we look like
snake owners to you?

30:19.384 --> 30:21.619
Uh, yeah, I sell live rats.

30:21.719 --> 30:22.754
But I'm sold out.

30:22.854 --> 30:24.189
Sold out?
Huh!

30:24.289 --> 30:27.992
Did you happen to sell a bunch
of them to someone recently?

30:28.092 --> 30:29.327
Are you two cops?

30:29.427 --> 30:32.363
Provincial Animal
Welfare Services.

30:32.463 --> 30:35.400
Also known as PAWS.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.936
Uh, yeah,
some guy left a message

30:38.036 --> 30:39.437
asking to reserve them,

30:39.537 --> 30:40.738
and came at night
to pick them up.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.106
I'm sure you already know this,

30:42.207 --> 30:44.509
but you have to have signed
paperwork to buy a live animal.

30:44.609 --> 30:45.543
Do you have that?

30:45.643 --> 30:47.679
Mm-hm.
Do you?

30:47.779 --> 30:49.981
Yeah.

30:52.650 --> 30:56.120
Here you go.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.423
Randy Weisbrock.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.793
- That dirty--
- Do not say it, please.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.929
I already
told you it wasn't me.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.265
Well, this is your name,
and your address.

31:07.365 --> 31:08.800
We got this from the store

31:08.900 --> 31:11.402
where you bought those
fine Norway rats last night.

31:11.502 --> 31:13.805
And then you drove
to Antonio's bistro,

31:13.905 --> 31:16.241
somewhere between
midnight and 8 am,

31:16.341 --> 31:19.410
and you placed those
poor, innocent rats in a vent.

31:19.510 --> 31:20.612
No.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.514
That's my name and address,
but that's not true.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.750
You already told us
you hate Antonio.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.252
We spoke to
a neighbour of yours.

31:27.352 --> 31:29.187
He said you were gone all night.

31:29.287 --> 31:30.288
Where'd you go?

31:30.388 --> 31:32.156
How'd you get that hand injury?

31:32.257 --> 31:34.859
Maybe it was pulling
a metal grate from an air vent

31:34.959 --> 31:36.427
to put rats inside.

31:36.527 --> 31:39.597
No! I got loaded at the bar
and got into a fight.

31:39.697 --> 31:40.865
I cut my hand open.

31:40.965 --> 31:43.835
I spent eight hours
in Emergency.

31:43.935 --> 31:47.338
You got any other
crazy theories?

31:47.438 --> 31:51.643
Yes, but they're even flimsier
than this one, so...

31:51.743 --> 31:54.612
Alright,
you want any food or not?

31:54.712 --> 31:56.547
What's the Prairie Dog like?

32:01.653 --> 32:04.822
I guess I'm a terrible writer
and a terrible detective.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.624
That's definitely not true.

32:06.724 --> 32:09.961
But you are a terrible driver.

32:10.061 --> 32:12.130
Ah--
Oh!

32:12.230 --> 32:14.132
Really?

32:14.232 --> 32:16.100
Wait... do that again.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.102
What? I've already
proven I'm bad at omelettes.

32:18.202 --> 32:19.504
What more do you want?

32:19.604 --> 32:22.307
No, no, the saucepan flip
in Antonio's deepfake video,

32:22.407 --> 32:25.276
it was done by someone
very experienced.

32:25.376 --> 32:26.644
Are you seriously crying

32:26.744 --> 32:28.246
like a little girl right now?

32:28.346 --> 32:31.382
I can't believe you!
What are you, stupid?

32:34.719 --> 32:35.954
See?
There.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.989
Someone with real
chef skills did that.

32:38.089 --> 32:39.624
And, he's left-handed!

32:39.724 --> 32:41.626
And Antonio
is right-handed.

32:41.726 --> 32:42.727
Hmm!

32:45.563 --> 32:47.165
Aww!

32:47.265 --> 32:48.800
Are you sure
I can't pay you for this?

32:48.900 --> 32:51.369
I mean,
prosciutto-wrapped scallops!

32:51.469 --> 32:53.137
They'll be awful
if I freeze them.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.139
Better they get used
today or tomorrow.

32:55.239 --> 32:57.809
Wow, this is
very generous of you.

32:57.909 --> 33:00.712
I mean, come on, at least
let me give you a couple bills.

33:00.812 --> 33:01.713
No, of course not.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.747
But listen...

33:02.847 --> 33:07.819
there is a favour
I'd like to ask you.

33:07.919 --> 33:10.154
Any chance you need
help around here?

33:10.254 --> 33:13.324
I'll do whatever, sous-chef,
chef de cuisine--

33:13.424 --> 33:16.227
I'll do the dishes
if you need me to!

33:16.327 --> 33:18.062
Oh, wow.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.065
I am so sorry.

33:21.165 --> 33:24.902
I totally put you
on the spot there.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.038
You know what,
just forget I asked.

33:27.138 --> 33:29.040
No, no, no...

33:29.140 --> 33:33.444
You can have your old job back!

33:33.544 --> 33:35.880
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:35.980 --> 33:38.049
Yeah, are you kidding me!

33:38.149 --> 33:40.018
We can be just like old times!

33:40.118 --> 33:41.386
Big crowds.
Stellar reviews.

33:41.486 --> 33:42.787
Not an empty seat in the house.

33:42.887 --> 33:44.522
Guys, Antonio's comin' back!

33:44.622 --> 33:49.060
Ha-ha!

33:49.160 --> 33:50.528
Oh my God, thank you.

33:50.628 --> 33:52.830
Thank you!

33:55.800 --> 33:57.635
You know, this whole thing,
at the very least,

33:57.735 --> 34:02.974
it's reminded me
who my real friends are.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.710
Come on, come on,
let's go make some scallops.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.046
Yeah, sounds good!

34:08.146 --> 34:09.947
What do you mean, "It's Jake"?
I thought it was Randy!

34:10.048 --> 34:11.949
He bought the rats
using Randy's name,

34:12.050 --> 34:13.518
and the handwriting
on that paperwork,

34:13.618 --> 34:15.987
it matches the note
that he gave to Darby.

34:16.087 --> 34:17.722
Antonio is right-handed

34:17.822 --> 34:19.924
but the person in the video
is left-handed.

34:20.024 --> 34:22.794
And when Jake wrote down
Randy's address for Darby,

34:22.894 --> 34:24.529
he used his left hand.

34:24.629 --> 34:26.297
Really?
Okay.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.532
Antonio is there now.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.367
- What, where?
- With Jake!

34:29.467 --> 34:31.269
He's-- he's there
dropping off food.

34:32.837 --> 34:35.473
No, I see.
Okay, thank you.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.275
Guys, I just spoke to
the restaurant owner.

34:37.375 --> 34:41.012
He said that Jake was trying
to be the chef and the manager,

34:41.112 --> 34:42.313
and he was failing at both.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.015
Well, Antonio just
sent me a text.

34:44.115 --> 34:45.817
He's-- he's accepted
his old job back.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.585
Okay, we'll call him next.

34:47.685 --> 34:48.820
We're headed there now.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.455
Okay, I-I'll ask
the neighbour to come over

34:50.555 --> 34:52.290
and look after Lucy
and I'll meet you there.

34:52.390 --> 34:53.591
Great.

34:53.691 --> 34:55.226
Hang on to your hat.

34:55.326 --> 34:57.295
Go!

34:57.395 --> 35:00.131
I can't believe we're
gonna work together again!

35:00.231 --> 35:03.801
You know, I...
I can't thank you enough.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.036
Of course.

35:05.136 --> 35:06.938
I mean, I won't
be able to start you

35:07.038 --> 35:10.541
at the same salary, but...
but we'll get back there.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.578
Oh!

35:13.678 --> 35:14.979
Sorry.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.348
I'll get this.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.483
Hi.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.118
Antonio, are you okay?

35:20.218 --> 35:22.487
Uh, yeah, of course I'm okay.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.155
Listen to me--
it's Jake!

35:24.255 --> 35:28.025
Jake is the one who made the
deepfake and planted the rats.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.393
No way.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.529
Yeah, I just got off the
phone with the restaurant owner.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.564
He said that Jake
was about to be fired!

35:33.664 --> 35:35.466
He's lying, so be careful!

35:35.566 --> 35:36.868
Um, sure!

35:36.968 --> 35:41.539
Yeah, okay, if-- if Lucy
won't settle, just try her--

35:41.639 --> 35:44.108
Sorry...
Try her dinosaur stuffy.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.844
- Is he right there?
- Yes.

35:46.944 --> 35:49.514
Yes, that or her blankie.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.682
One of those should work.

35:51.782 --> 35:52.683
You know what?

35:52.783 --> 35:55.486
It's fine,
I can pick her up early.

35:55.586 --> 35:56.854
No, no bother at all.

35:56.954 --> 35:58.990
Okay, ciao.

36:02.793 --> 36:06.230
Uh, so thank you for the wine,

36:06.330 --> 36:07.798
but I have to get going.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.734
Oh, man, we're celebrating!

36:09.834 --> 36:11.369
Come on,
we got paperwork to sign.

36:11.469 --> 36:14.372
It-- it's fine.
Uh, I'll come back!

36:14.472 --> 36:15.473
I work here now!

36:15.573 --> 36:17.909
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.377
Who was that on the phone?

36:19.477 --> 36:21.179
Hmm?

36:21.279 --> 36:24.015
Uh, that-- that was
Lucy's daycare.

36:24.115 --> 36:28.186
She's being fussy, so I really
have to go pick her up.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.022
I thought you said
she was with Zane.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.256
No, I didn't.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.891
Did I?

36:33.991 --> 36:37.361
Alright, your campaign
to ruin Antonio's reputation

36:37.461 --> 36:38.529
stops now!

36:38.629 --> 36:40.064
Who are you?

36:40.164 --> 36:41.332
Victoria Spencer.

36:41.432 --> 36:45.336
One half of The Spencer Sisters,
private investigators.

36:45.436 --> 36:47.171
- Sisters?
- See?

36:47.271 --> 36:48.573
No one buys it!

36:48.673 --> 36:50.608
Now I get it.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.810
Jake asked me back
a few months ago,

36:52.910 --> 36:56.714
right after I opened the bistro,
and I turned him down.

36:56.814 --> 36:59.684
I can't believe
you did that to me!

36:59.784 --> 37:01.786
I thought we were friends.

37:01.886 --> 37:05.289
Yeah, I thought so too.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.226
But you screwed me over!

37:08.326 --> 37:10.094
Whoa.

37:10.194 --> 37:12.063
And I worked so hard!

37:12.163 --> 37:14.999
We were finally getting
somewhere and you deserted me!

37:15.099 --> 37:17.602
You have no loyalty.

37:17.702 --> 37:19.337
You're off enjoying
your new adventure

37:19.437 --> 37:21.138
and I-I'm left with, with...

37:21.239 --> 37:23.574
The frustration
that you maybe never

37:23.674 --> 37:24.942
even had any talent?

37:25.042 --> 37:27.979
That you're Salieri
to Antonio's Mozart?

37:28.079 --> 37:29.313
Yikes!

37:29.413 --> 37:30.948
Choose your moments, Mom!

37:31.048 --> 37:34.418
- What?
- Jake, it's over.

37:34.518 --> 37:35.586
- No.
- Yeah.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.488
- No.
- You have nowhere to go, okay?

37:37.588 --> 37:38.789
You're surrounded.
Give it up.

37:38.889 --> 37:40.691
Put the knife down.

37:42.827 --> 37:43.961
Come on.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.266
You're not going anywhere!

37:48.366 --> 37:50.301
I'm a bad-ass pickleball player

37:50.401 --> 37:53.871
and I will show
no mercy to your face!

37:53.971 --> 37:56.173
You're under arrest
for defamatory libel

37:56.274 --> 37:59.710
and animal endangerment.

37:59.810 --> 38:02.113
Man, we...
we had such a good thing,

38:02.213 --> 38:04.482
and you just threw it away!

38:04.582 --> 38:07.184
Some friend you are!

38:07.285 --> 38:08.419
You okay?

38:08.519 --> 38:10.488
- Now I am.
- Yeah, okay.

38:10.588 --> 38:11.822
God.

38:11.922 --> 38:14.525
Yeah.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.528
You're probably good
to set down the wok.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.964
Fair enough.

38:20.064 --> 38:21.699
We're wokking.

38:21.799 --> 38:22.800
Let's wok, hon'.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.835
Oh, God, you had to say it,
didn't you?

38:24.935 --> 38:25.870
It's a joke.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.138
I know.

38:37.214 --> 38:38.282
Hi.

38:38.382 --> 38:40.318
- Hey.
- I'm so happy she's back.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.486
What did Antonio
do to swing that?

38:42.586 --> 38:46.457
He made me apologize to her
and do my best grovelling.

38:46.557 --> 38:48.659
Also, I sent her a case
of the wine she liked.

38:48.759 --> 38:49.794
Oh, well done!

38:51.562 --> 38:52.797
And thanks to you two,

38:52.897 --> 38:54.565
it looks like Antonio and I
might be able to retire

38:54.665 --> 38:56.600
someday after all.

38:56.701 --> 38:57.768
Lucky you.

38:57.868 --> 38:58.936
So, the review just came out.

38:59.036 --> 39:01.839
Turns out Alder Bluffs Life...

39:01.939 --> 39:02.973
loves me!

39:03.074 --> 39:04.275
Look, look, look, look, look!

39:04.375 --> 39:06.677
Oh, it's so good!

39:06.777 --> 39:09.347
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.649
You and Victoria
can eat here free.

39:11.749 --> 39:13.617
- For life!
- We will!

39:13.718 --> 39:15.720
And a round of drinks
on the house!

39:15.820 --> 39:17.655
For everybody!

39:17.755 --> 39:22.293
And there goes
a chunk of our retirement.

39:22.393 --> 39:25.162
I'm really sorry
I lied to you, Zane.

39:25.262 --> 39:27.732
Well, I hear what you
and Antonio were saying

39:27.832 --> 39:29.500
about me going
a little overboard

39:29.600 --> 39:31.569
when my loved ones
are threatened, so...

39:31.669 --> 39:34.638
There are worse impulses
that a person can have.

39:34.739 --> 39:35.706
Namely?

39:35.806 --> 39:37.441
- Early rising.
- Okay.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.410
Shameless singing.

39:39.510 --> 39:42.580
Wearing revealing nighties
in front of family.

39:42.680 --> 39:47.084
So where is Victoria,
by the way?

39:48.285 --> 39:51.122
No, no, no,
you just don't understand.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.357
Okay, maybe
I'm more of a visual thinker.

39:53.457 --> 39:55.826
See, there's
your problem: thinking!

39:55.926 --> 39:57.895
Don't think.
Just do.

39:57.995 --> 39:59.330
Or maybe you
just don't understand

39:59.430 --> 40:02.066
what I'm trying
to teach you, Vicki.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.834
It's Victoria.

40:03.934 --> 40:06.537
Where is MONEY?
Show me MONEY!

40:06.637 --> 40:07.738
I don't know why I bother.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.540
Most women don't
understand MONEY, anyway--

40:09.640 --> 40:11.142
Okay, relax, mansplainer!

40:11.242 --> 40:13.043
You don't get to bully
and belittle my mother

40:13.144 --> 40:14.912
in her own home
with your stupid acronyms

40:15.012 --> 40:16.680
and your
paint-by-number formulas.

40:16.781 --> 40:18.849
You have no idea
how hard she works,

40:18.949 --> 40:20.885
how dedicated she is!

40:20.985 --> 40:23.320
It isn't just about how many
books she can spew out.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.289
She actually cares about
her readership and about

40:25.389 --> 40:27.892
offering her readers books
that are meaningful.

40:29.026 --> 40:31.295
- Does she care too much? Maybe.
- Darby...

40:31.395 --> 40:33.097
Does she get
paralysed by doubt?

40:33.197 --> 40:33.964
- Sometimes.
- Darby...

40:34.064 --> 40:35.266
Does she take it out
on her daughter?

40:35.366 --> 40:37.101
- I think so.
- Darby!

40:37.201 --> 40:38.269
What?

40:38.369 --> 40:40.871
It's my turn.

40:40.971 --> 40:42.173
You know what?

40:42.273 --> 40:44.909
You can take your tips,
your tricks, your fake names,

40:45.009 --> 40:46.944
and all of your awards,
and shove 'em!

40:47.044 --> 40:49.079
As for MONEY,
here's what I got.

40:49.180 --> 40:53.117
M for "Misfortune," for having
to spend my precious hours

40:53.217 --> 40:54.752
with a creep like you!

40:54.852 --> 40:56.454
- O, "Orgasms."
- Hmm!

40:56.554 --> 40:58.656
Plenty, and they're
none of your damn business!

40:58.756 --> 40:59.723
Ooh, TMI!

40:59.824 --> 41:01.725
N, "Nifty Gizmos."

41:01.826 --> 41:04.295
A direct line to Alder Bluff's
police department

41:04.395 --> 41:10.134
if you don't get
the hell out of my house.

41:10.234 --> 41:12.903
And E, "Envy,"

41:13.003 --> 41:17.775
