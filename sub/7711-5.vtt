00:03.407 --> 00:05.478
Brain teaser.

00:05.512 --> 00:07.549
I have two coins
totaling 15 cents.

00:07.583 --> 00:09.420
One of them is not a nickel.
What are they?

00:09.452 --> 00:10.454
A dime and a nickel.

00:11.757 --> 00:13.328
No, I said one of them
is not a nickel--

00:13.361 --> 00:14.562
But the other one is.

00:14.597 --> 00:15.599
I've heard that before.

00:15.631 --> 00:19.672
Okay, a man and his son
get into a car accident.

00:19.707 --> 00:21.211
They are rushed to
the hospital.

00:21.243 --> 00:22.478
The doctor says,

00:22.512 --> 00:24.150
"There's no way I can
operate on this boy."

00:24.182 --> 00:25.219
"Because he's my son."

00:25.251 --> 00:26.820
The doctor is the boy's mother.

00:26.854 --> 00:29.360
A man is found hanging
from the ceiling.

00:29.392 --> 00:30.795
He stepped on a block of ice,
hung himself,

00:30.828 --> 00:32.798
and the ice melted.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.603
A hunter--

00:34.637 --> 00:35.605
It's a polar bear because
you're at the North Pole.

00:35.639 --> 00:36.674
Damn it!

00:36.707 --> 00:39.680
[upbeat piano music]

00:39.713 --> 00:47.729
*

01:10.308 --> 01:11.676
Tell me what you did
yesterday.

01:11.711 --> 01:13.680
Uh, nothing.

01:13.715 --> 01:15.652
Nothing?
Yeah, nothing.

01:15.684 --> 01:16.853
How was your day?

01:16.887 --> 01:18.290
I don't care
how your day was, Michael.

01:18.325 --> 01:20.494
[sighs]
Wow.

01:20.529 --> 01:21.863
Well, okay.

01:21.897 --> 01:23.901
I don't care how
your day was either, Jan.

01:23.934 --> 01:25.905
I was just asking you
because you asked me.

01:25.938 --> 01:28.278
Tell me what you did
yesterday.

01:28.310 --> 01:29.680
I worked.

01:29.713 --> 01:32.286
And then I went home
to my condo.

01:32.319 --> 01:33.788
And Carol came over.

01:33.821 --> 01:35.959
And we had sex.

01:35.991 --> 01:38.331
Is that what
you want to hear?

01:38.365 --> 01:41.636
Never, ever, ever sleep
with your boss.

01:41.670 --> 01:42.938
I'm so lucky that Jan and I

01:42.973 --> 01:44.877
only got to second base.

01:44.910 --> 01:46.247
Hi, Pam.

01:46.281 --> 01:47.283
Hi.
I'm great.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.519
So, Pam,
I'd like you to keep

01:49.552 --> 01:51.824
a log of everything
Michael does hour by hour

01:51.857 --> 01:53.025
so that we can analyze it
at corporate, okay?

01:53.058 --> 01:55.265
Oh, I don't know--
Thanks, Pam.

01:57.001 --> 01:58.035
(Pam)
It's weird.

01:58.068 --> 01:59.373
Jan used to treat Michael

01:59.407 --> 02:00.241
like he was a 10-year-old.

02:00.241 --> 02:02.946
But lately it's like
he's five.

02:02.979 --> 02:05.017
So, are you excited?

02:05.049 --> 02:06.521
Yeah.

02:06.553 --> 02:08.758
Very excited?

02:08.790 --> 02:11.597
Yes, I'm very excited.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.367
Extremely excited?

02:14.469 --> 02:17.376
Just very--
That's cool.

02:17.408 --> 02:19.647
(Ryan)
I have spent a year here.

02:19.679 --> 02:24.422
And I have to commit
or get out, so...

02:24.457 --> 02:26.058
Dwight's the top salesman
in the company,

02:26.092 --> 02:28.697
and he's taking me on
my first sales call today.

02:28.730 --> 02:31.404
And, um, I'm excited.

02:31.436 --> 02:35.644
I am very excited.
Ryan hasn't made a sale yet.

02:35.678 --> 02:40.087
But more importantly,
he hasn't made an ally yet.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.493
Is he gonna be a slacker-
loser-wise-ass like Jim was,

02:42.526 --> 02:46.131
or is he gonna join
the Dwight Army of Champions?

02:46.164 --> 02:47.869
So, what if
they're not talking much?

02:47.903 --> 02:51.141
Then does it make sense to
kind of lead the conversation?

02:51.175 --> 02:52.979
You know, just until it gets
to a point where

02:53.013 --> 02:55.784
they are asking questions?

02:59.692 --> 03:01.430
[engine shuts off]

03:02.733 --> 03:06.104
So, where's
the sales office?

03:06.139 --> 03:08.042
When you are ready
to see the sales office,

03:08.076 --> 03:10.414
the sales office will
present itself to you.

03:11.916 --> 03:15.156
Your journey begins now.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.137
Hey.

03:22.170 --> 03:24.174
(Jim)
What?

03:24.209 --> 03:26.178
My chair's squeaking.

03:26.213 --> 03:27.014
Is it?

03:27.046 --> 03:28.718
You took my chair.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.022
No, I didn't.

03:31.054 --> 03:32.693
I took back the chair
that you took from me.

03:32.725 --> 03:33.995
But I didn't take your chair.

03:34.028 --> 03:34.963
When you get up,

03:34.997 --> 03:37.469
I'm just gonna take it back
anyway, so...

03:37.503 --> 03:39.940
So I guess I can't get up.

03:56.272 --> 03:58.109
Hey, Coselli!

03:58.143 --> 04:00.212
The Coz!
The Cosby.

04:00.248 --> 04:02.084
[imitating Bill Cosby]
Hey, hey, hey!

04:02.117 --> 04:04.823
I love Jell-O Pudding Pops!

04:04.857 --> 04:09.097
My son Theo love
Jell-O Pudding Pops too.

04:09.130 --> 04:11.904
(Dwight)
Do you know
where we are, Temp?

04:11.936 --> 04:13.540
(Ryan)
I know where we're not.

04:13.575 --> 04:16.780
I hold in my hand
a beet seed.

04:16.814 --> 04:19.051
Take it.

04:19.085 --> 04:20.053
Ah--

04:20.087 --> 04:21.089
When you--

04:22.792 --> 04:23.794
Damn it.

04:28.705 --> 04:29.707
Hey, Big Tuna.

04:29.739 --> 04:31.109
Can I talk to you
for a second?

04:31.142 --> 04:32.176
Sure.

04:32.211 --> 04:34.115
Can you stand up

04:34.148 --> 04:36.654
and talk to me over there?

04:40.060 --> 04:41.129
That's it?

04:41.162 --> 04:42.231
That's what you
came up with?

04:42.264 --> 04:44.902
I'm acting my heart out
here.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.940
Really, huh?
Yeah, really.

04:46.973 --> 04:49.211
You asked for my help,
so I helped.

04:53.419 --> 04:56.893
[man over P.A.]
Attention, Scranton
Business Park.

04:56.926 --> 04:58.163
There will be
complimentary pretzels

04:58.196 --> 05:01.803
available in the lobby
from now until 4:00

05:01.837 --> 05:04.208
as a thank-you
to our loyal tenants.

05:10.721 --> 05:12.693
(Pam)
Once a year, they bring in
a little cart.

05:12.725 --> 05:14.328
And they give away
free pretzels.

05:14.362 --> 05:17.334
It's really not a big deal.

05:17.368 --> 05:19.205
To some people it is.

05:19.238 --> 05:20.774
Productivity is important.

05:20.809 --> 05:22.813
But how can I be productive

05:22.845 --> 05:24.280
if I have this one little
thing in my brain

05:24.315 --> 05:26.118
that I cannot get out?

05:26.152 --> 05:28.725
And that one little thing
is a soft pretzel.

05:28.758 --> 05:30.260
So I'm just gonna have
my soft pretzel.

05:30.292 --> 05:31.262
And I'll get to work.

05:31.294 --> 05:32.866
And I'll be super productive.

05:32.898 --> 05:33.935
Look out for me!

05:35.270 --> 05:37.241
Oh, sh--

05:37.274 --> 05:39.110
Come on.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.237
And just as you have planted
your seed in the ground,

05:52.271 --> 05:55.343
I am going to plant my seed
in you.

05:55.378 --> 05:57.783
I don't think you know
what you're saying.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.351
Smells pretty bad,
doesn't it?

05:59.386 --> 06:00.721
Uh-huh.

06:00.721 --> 06:02.491
It's called bullcrap.

06:02.525 --> 06:05.162
And a client can smell it
from a mile away.

06:05.196 --> 06:06.900
Gotcha.

06:06.934 --> 06:07.902
Oh, hey--

06:07.936 --> 06:09.305
I forgot something
in my car.

06:09.337 --> 06:10.841
I'll be right back.

06:10.874 --> 06:12.276
Okay.

06:25.303 --> 06:26.906
Of course.

06:29.579 --> 06:32.351
(Stanley)
I wake up every morning
in a bed that's too small.

06:32.384 --> 06:34.823
Drive my daughter to a school
that's too expensive.

06:34.857 --> 06:36.325
And then I go to work
to a job

06:36.359 --> 06:38.228
for which I get paid
too little.

06:38.262 --> 06:41.101
But on pretzel day...

06:41.134 --> 06:44.008
Well, I like pretzel day.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.411
'Cause they're acting
all tough and everything.

06:45.444 --> 06:47.381
But what they were
rapping about was cupcakes

06:47.415 --> 06:48.918
and The Chronicles of Narnia.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.022
Who invented cupcakes,
right?

06:51.054 --> 06:52.156
I want to kill them.
Hey!

06:52.190 --> 06:53.225
Hey, Phyllis!

06:53.258 --> 06:54.429
What are you doing?

06:54.462 --> 06:56.064
I'm just saying hi
to Bob.

06:56.099 --> 06:57.502
No, I think you're
cutting in line.

06:57.535 --> 06:59.170
Well, settle down, Scott.

06:59.204 --> 07:00.474
No, I'm not gonna settle down.
No, no way.

07:00.508 --> 07:02.110
Uh-uh, boo!
Get in the back, please.

07:02.144 --> 07:04.415
Boo!
Back of the line!

07:04.449 --> 07:05.650
Thank you!

07:05.684 --> 07:07.421
Back of the line.

07:08.423 --> 07:09.892
That's right.

07:09.927 --> 07:11.294
What a pair of Marys.

07:11.329 --> 07:13.065
This is pretzel day.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.034
"Hey, Dwight,
you're a great salesman.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.036
Can you teach me?"

07:15.069 --> 07:16.205
"Sure, Ryan.

07:16.239 --> 07:17.542
"I'll make you kneel
in cow manure.

07:17.574 --> 07:19.612
And I'll abandon you
in a beet field."

07:19.645 --> 07:21.214
"Oh, that sounds great,
Dwight.

07:21.249 --> 07:22.384
"I really appreciate that.

07:22.417 --> 07:25.458
Thank you so much
for your mentorship."

07:29.398 --> 07:33.205
Congratulations,
resourceful salesman.

07:33.238 --> 07:36.144
You have passed
the second challenge.

07:36.179 --> 07:38.684
Welcome to Schrute Farm!

07:40.219 --> 07:43.225
[chair squeaking]

07:48.604 --> 07:50.508
* Love me, love me

07:50.541 --> 07:53.013
* Say that you love me

07:53.046 --> 07:55.083
* Fool me, fool me
Stop.

07:55.117 --> 07:57.488
* Go on and fool me

07:57.522 --> 07:59.357
* Love me, love me

07:59.390 --> 08:00.961
* Say that you love me
This is not fair.

08:00.961 --> 08:02.296
It's gonna be
in my head all day.

08:02.331 --> 08:03.466
Please?

08:03.499 --> 08:06.204
* Go on and fool me

08:06.239 --> 08:07.374
* Love me, love me

08:07.406 --> 08:09.244
This is not
a proportionate response.

* Say that you love me

08:10.313 --> 08:12.684
* Fool me, fool me

* Go on and fool me

08:15.156 --> 08:21.102
* I don't care 'bout
anything but you *

08:23.073 --> 08:25.511
Whatever happened
to those guys?

08:28.649 --> 08:29.619
Michael.

08:29.651 --> 08:30.653
No cuts!

08:30.688 --> 08:32.191
Oh, Pam.

08:32.223 --> 08:33.325
Just the woman
I'd like to see.

08:33.358 --> 08:34.327
You read my mind.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.197
Great.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.134
I thought you might want
to use this time

08:37.167 --> 08:38.203
to authorize some checks.

08:38.236 --> 08:39.270
I thought that maybe
you could

08:39.305 --> 08:40.808
wait in line for me
while I go to the bathroom.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.311
You're an angel.

08:42.343 --> 08:44.248
Hey, why don't you just
go up to your office,

08:44.280 --> 08:45.282
get some work done,

08:45.317 --> 08:46.319
and I'll bring you
a pretzel?

08:46.351 --> 08:47.787
Because I like them
a certain way.

08:47.822 --> 08:49.290
And if it gets screwed up,

08:49.325 --> 08:51.262
then this whole thing's blown.

08:51.294 --> 08:52.797
You know, I just think it's
really important that

08:52.832 --> 08:54.300
you be productive today.

08:54.335 --> 08:56.539
Pam, productivity starts with

08:56.573 --> 08:58.744
patience and determination.

08:58.777 --> 09:00.479
Okay.

09:07.862 --> 09:09.832
It is time for
your next test.

09:09.865 --> 09:12.171
You have planted
the beet seed.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.775
You have walked the long,
lonely walk of loneliness.

09:14.808 --> 09:15.777
Look, man.

09:15.810 --> 09:17.281
I was in a frat in college.

09:17.313 --> 09:19.218
So I know what you're doing.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.220
I get it.

09:20.252 --> 09:21.355
You know what
your problem is?

09:21.388 --> 09:22.891
You know why you haven't
made any sales?

09:22.925 --> 09:24.327
Because you think
you know everything.

09:24.361 --> 09:25.897
You have to trust
that maybe

09:25.931 --> 09:27.201
there are other people

09:27.234 --> 09:28.637
that can teach you things.

09:28.670 --> 09:31.341
Are you ready to learn?

09:31.375 --> 09:34.348
Are you ready for
the final test?

09:34.380 --> 09:35.350
Yeah.

09:35.382 --> 09:36.319
Come on!

09:40.694 --> 09:41.663
Thank you.

09:41.696 --> 09:42.665
Hi, please tell me
you have

09:42.698 --> 09:43.667
a sweet pretzel left.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.370
We do.
Thank God.

09:45.402 --> 09:46.571
And we have
18 different toppings.

09:46.605 --> 09:48.343
We have sweet glaze,
cinnamon sugar,

09:48.376 --> 09:49.477
chocolate, white chocolate,

09:49.510 --> 09:52.351
fudge, M&Ms, caramel dip,
mint chip, chocolate chip,

09:52.384 --> 09:54.722
marshmallows, nuts,
toffee nuts, coconuts,

09:54.756 --> 09:57.394
peanut butter drizzle, Oreos,
sprinkles, cotton candy bits,

09:57.426 --> 09:58.229
and powdered sugar.

09:58.263 --> 10:01.201
Is there any way
that you could do all?

10:01.201 --> 10:02.236
All of them?

10:02.270 --> 10:03.005
The works?
You got it.

10:03.038 --> 10:04.308
All right!

10:04.341 --> 10:05.611
Thank you.

10:06.713 --> 10:08.515
Please be seated.

10:14.661 --> 10:15.897
What was that?

10:15.930 --> 10:17.334
Pay no attention
to the spirits

10:17.366 --> 10:18.502
that haunt this
hallowed ground.

10:18.536 --> 10:20.372
Is that your cousin Mose?

10:20.407 --> 10:21.475
Yes.

10:21.508 --> 10:24.948
Mose is my cousin,
and he lives here.

10:24.982 --> 10:27.354
He will always be
my best friend.

10:27.386 --> 10:29.023
Unless things go well
with Ryan today.

10:29.057 --> 10:30.392
In which case
I won't hang out with Mose

10:30.427 --> 10:31.495
so much anymore.

10:31.528 --> 10:35.703
What is the greatest danger
facing Dunder-Mifflin?

10:35.737 --> 10:38.777
Outsourcing and consolidation
of competition.

10:38.810 --> 10:40.078
Wrong.
Flash floods.

10:40.111 --> 10:42.451
What is the true cause

10:42.484 --> 10:45.490
of Robert Mifflin's suicide?

10:46.692 --> 10:47.661
Depression?

10:47.694 --> 10:49.064
Wrong.
He hated himself.

10:49.096 --> 10:52.905
What is
the Dharma Initiative?

10:52.938 --> 10:55.076
I can't believe that
Ryan is not back yet.

10:55.108 --> 10:56.078
Where could they be?

10:56.110 --> 10:57.815
Sales take a long time.

10:57.848 --> 10:59.116
Oh, my God.
I'm so worried.

10:59.149 --> 11:01.321
I'm sure Dwight
will protect him.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.426
I don't know.
Dwight's so weird.

11:03.459 --> 11:05.698
He's not weird.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.601
He's just individualistic.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.936
No, he's a freak.

11:08.970 --> 11:10.372
You're a freak!

11:14.180 --> 11:15.783
Final question,

11:15.818 --> 11:18.355
young Ryan Howard.

11:21.127 --> 11:22.732
What...

11:25.537 --> 11:30.179
is Michael Scott's
greatest fear?

11:30.211 --> 11:33.653
Um, loneliness.

11:33.685 --> 11:35.423
Maybe women.

11:35.457 --> 11:36.559
Wrong.

11:36.592 --> 11:38.829
He's not afraid of anything.

11:38.863 --> 11:41.435
Also, I would've accepted
snakes.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.575
Fear is what
it's all about.

11:44.608 --> 11:48.182
You cannot sell
while undergoing fear.

11:48.214 --> 11:50.820
You need to vanquish fear!

11:50.853 --> 11:55.863
One must wrestle fear
to the ground.

11:55.897 --> 11:58.002
You will now
wrestle my cousin Mose!

11:58.035 --> 11:59.972
No!
Okay, all right!

12:00.006 --> 12:01.208
Wrestle him to the ground!

12:01.240 --> 12:02.476
This is over, okay?

12:02.510 --> 12:03.412
You're a freak.

12:03.445 --> 12:05.016
I'm not doing this anymore
and this is over.

12:05.049 --> 12:06.551
Ryan--
Good-bye.

12:06.585 --> 12:08.688
Ryan, you don't have
to wrestle him.

12:08.723 --> 12:09.724
Ryan, just get in
the coffin.

12:10.928 --> 12:13.164
Ryan...

12:13.198 --> 12:15.036
Bye, Ryan.

12:17.306 --> 12:18.909
He seemed nice.

12:20.279 --> 12:21.882
Where are all
the animals?

12:23.152 --> 12:24.989
[horn honking]

12:25.022 --> 12:26.624
Ryan, come on.
I am sorry.

12:26.659 --> 12:27.661
I am sorry.

12:27.693 --> 12:28.663
Mose is sorry too.

12:28.695 --> 12:29.665
Look--

12:29.697 --> 12:32.604
He sent over a basket
with eggs

12:32.636 --> 12:34.007
and some fat back bacon.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.009
And look--

12:35.042 --> 12:37.782
Something he whittled.

12:44.027 --> 12:45.563
[chair squeaks]

12:46.764 --> 12:49.771
[chair squeaking]

12:55.750 --> 12:57.153
You still mad?

13:01.360 --> 13:02.831
It's just--

13:02.865 --> 13:04.902
Jim and I didn't
get along.

13:04.936 --> 13:08.709
And...I didn't want it
to be that way again.

13:09.912 --> 13:12.150
You know, I wanted us
to be a team.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.820
An unstoppable team

13:13.853 --> 13:15.322
that competed against
other teams.

13:15.355 --> 13:17.393
Look, that's not
what I wanted, okay?

13:17.426 --> 13:20.332
I just wanted
to go on a sales call.

13:20.365 --> 13:23.272
Screw gun!
The sales call!

13:26.712 --> 13:29.685

13:38.904 --> 13:43.746

13:43.779 --> 13:45.282

* Hey

13:49.926 --> 13:51.194
Mr. Coselli.

13:51.228 --> 13:52.296
[imitating Bill Cosby]
Hey, hey, hey!

13:52.330 --> 13:54.300
The Cos!
What's going on?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.468
Do we have a deal?

13:55.501 --> 13:56.972
Deal or no deal?

13:57.005 --> 13:58.342
Let's make a deal.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.978
So what is the deal?

14:00.011 --> 14:01.181
Establish time frames.

14:01.214 --> 14:03.853
Keep the phrase "real dollars"
in their heads.

14:03.887 --> 14:05.455
And always keep the power
in the conversation.

14:05.488 --> 14:07.193
That's why you're losing them
on the cold calls.

14:07.226 --> 14:09.865
Because you say
the word "please" too much.

14:09.898 --> 14:11.001
Wait, can you go back?

14:11.034 --> 14:12.871
Michael always says
K-I-S-S.

14:12.904 --> 14:14.740
"Keep it simple, stupid."

14:14.775 --> 14:15.509
Great advice.

14:15.542 --> 14:17.747
Hurts my feelings
every time.

14:17.781 --> 14:20.151
Okay, I'm gonna
establish time frames.

14:20.185 --> 14:21.454
Good.

14:21.487 --> 14:22.892
I'm gonna put everything
in terms of real dollars.

14:22.924 --> 14:23.691
Right.

14:23.725 --> 14:24.626
I'm gonna ask
a lot of questions

14:24.659 --> 14:26.363
that all have sort of
positive answers.

14:26.398 --> 14:27.400
So they'll say
"That would be better" or

14:27.432 --> 14:28.434
"We would like that."

14:28.468 --> 14:29.838
Exactly, yes, good.

14:29.871 --> 14:31.108
I'm going to try
to be confident

14:31.140 --> 14:32.142
but not cocky.

14:33.577 --> 14:35.548
Oh, hey, everyone.

14:35.581 --> 14:37.821
I am officially streamlining
the efficiency

14:37.854 --> 14:39.390

14:40.894 --> 14:41.963
Yes, second, Toby.

14:41.995 --> 14:44.969

on increased accountability

14:45.001 --> 14:46.137
from every single
one of you.

14:46.170 --> 14:47.908
Account--
Michael, what's going on?

14:47.942 --> 14:49.243
And I will be
taking questions.

14:49.277 --> 14:51.080
Did you have a lot of
sugar today, Michael?

14:51.113 --> 14:52.249
What's on your suit?

14:52.283 --> 14:53.318
Caramel dip.

14:53.352 --> 14:54.519
But one question
at a time, please.

14:54.554 --> 14:55.991
Phyllis, Stanley--

14:56.023 --> 14:57.159
I want you to switch desks.

14:57.192 --> 14:58.594
I'm going to reorganize

14:58.627 --> 15:00.900
and restructure
the physical layout

15:00.934 --> 15:01.801
of the office to
maximize everything.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.374
I think we're getting
a lot done, don't you?

15:04.407 --> 15:05.475
On paper, at least.

15:05.509 --> 15:07.380
And we are, after all,
a paper company.

15:07.412 --> 15:08.582
Are we not?
Are we not?

15:08.614 --> 15:09.416
Are we not?
Are you with me?

15:09.450 --> 15:11.955
Are you with me?
Thank you very much.

15:14.493 --> 15:15.963
(Ryan)
They really didn't like me.

15:15.997 --> 15:16.999
(Dwight)
They did not.

15:17.032 --> 15:19.303
But they didn't have to
say it to your face.

15:19.337 --> 15:20.605
I don't get it.

15:20.639 --> 15:22.977
I don't get
what I did wrong.

15:23.012 --> 15:24.447
Not everything's
a lesson, Ryan.

15:24.479 --> 15:25.516
Sometimes you just fail.

15:25.548 --> 15:27.520
It's those
online paper jerks.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.524
The whole business
is changing.

15:29.556 --> 15:30.558
You know what?

15:30.592 --> 15:31.394
They're gonna be screwed

15:31.428 --> 15:33.432
once this whole
Internet fad is over.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.268
What are you doing?
Oh, no!

15:35.301 --> 15:38.607
No, no, no!
No, Ryan!

Yes!

could've sent you anywhere.

all the time.

go through the system

you'd be there.

send me a copy of that?

Yeah, totally.

17:39.284 --> 17:40.585

So--

17:40.619 --> 17:42.390
Do you--
Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.

17:42.422 --> 17:44.160
Uh, no--
I, um...

the same here.

we were?

It felt far.

18:07.673 --> 18:09.444
Yeah.

18:09.476 --> 18:11.481
I have a question for you.
What?

18:11.514 --> 18:13.217
How many words per minute

18:13.252 --> 18:14.953
does the average person type?

18:14.987 --> 18:16.258
I type 90.

18:16.290 --> 18:17.959
Shut up.

18:17.993 --> 18:19.730
Mavis Beacon doesn't even
type 90.

18:19.764 --> 18:20.799
It's true.

18:20.831 --> 18:22.436
Okay, I said average.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.438
70?

18:23.471 --> 18:24.440
How many do you type?

18:24.473 --> 18:25.576
Forget it.

18:25.608 --> 18:27.679
I was just about to brag.
Forget it.

18:27.713 --> 18:29.416
Come on, tell me.
No.

18:29.450 --> 18:30.952

No, it's--
That's respectable.

18:38.467 --> 18:39.536
Respectable?

18:39.569 --> 18:41.841
So, okay,
I'm watching the movie.

18:41.874 --> 18:44.914
By myself,
because I just wanted

18:44.947 --> 18:46.451
a relaxing evening
at home.

18:46.483 --> 18:49.390
Okay.

18:49.424 --> 18:50.558
And I'm freaking out!

18:50.591 --> 18:51.593
Yeah.

18:51.627 --> 18:52.595
That movie is so scary.

18:52.629 --> 18:53.597
I know.

18:53.631 --> 18:55.034
But I'm holding on

18:55.066 --> 18:56.971
because I keep waiting
for Sandra Bullock to show up.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.173
No way!

How do you confuse 28 Days
with 28 Days Later?

19:02.282 --> 19:03.817
Because I got it
at Blockbuster

19:03.852 --> 19:05.555
and they don't put
the pictures on the box.

19:05.588 --> 19:07.892
You're making this up.

19:07.926 --> 19:09.630
Would I make that up?

19:09.664 --> 19:10.965
Yes!

19:10.998 --> 19:12.969

would make that up.

19:17.713 --> 19:21.119
I have one bedroom,
one bathroom, and a closet.

19:21.151 --> 19:22.490
And how many kitchens?

19:22.522 --> 19:23.625
I have one kitchen.

19:23.657 --> 19:25.629
Wow, you got totally taken

19:25.661 --> 19:26.963
for a ride, Beesly.

19:26.998 --> 19:29.034
It's actually--

19:29.068 --> 19:31.540
Most apartments these days
have, like, three.

19:31.574 --> 19:32.542
Three kitchens?

19:32.576 --> 19:34.447
Yes.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.616
How are you gonna cook

19:35.648 --> 19:37.051
every meal of the day
in one kitchen?

19:37.083 --> 19:38.587
Hey, Ryan.
Are you okay?

19:38.622 --> 19:40.024
Pam?

19:40.057 --> 19:41.928
Yeah. Yeah.

19:41.961 --> 19:43.498
Pam?

19:43.532 --> 19:45.134
Um, okay.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.603
Bye.

19:46.638 --> 19:48.642
Oh, yeah.
I should probably--

19:48.674 --> 19:49.977
Oh, no--
I was, um--

19:50.010 --> 19:50.979
I don't know.

19:51.012 --> 19:52.749
You have to go?
Yeah.

19:52.782 --> 19:53.751
No, I should
probably go too.

19:53.784 --> 19:54.853
Okay.

19:54.887 --> 19:56.991
I mean, yeah.

19:57.024 --> 19:58.026
Yeah.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.034
Bye, Pam.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.671
Bye, Jim.

20:31.260 --> 20:35.468
364 days...
Until the next pretzel day.
