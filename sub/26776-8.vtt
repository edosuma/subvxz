give it back?

11:31.257 --> 11:34.527
So I can punch it, or?

become virus.

Here comes
a wrecking ball!

11:47.540 --> 11:48.707
Well I guess
I'll have to just

11:48.774 --> 11:51.010
have to mosey on back
to the Man Cave

11:51.077 --> 11:52.578

- What is this thing?

12:03.556 --> 12:06.225
- Uh, funny story...

12:06.292 --> 12:08.194
So the computer virus
took over Rick's body

12:08.260 --> 12:10.763
and now it's all angry
and wants to destroy humanity.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.198

surprise punch it?

12:12.264 --> 12:13.999

surprise punch it!

But it's got your
superfast reflexes now.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.437
- Well it is a
pretty sweet power.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.606
- Well not as good
as being indestructable, but.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.608
- I am virus,
I spread and destroy.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.309
I'm indestructible.
Well that's lucky.

I am 36.

good time with all of you.

And connecting.
Face to face.

Like real people.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.086
And I don't know,
I just think that--

18:43.121 --> 18:45.257
- Hey, power's back on.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.226
- That means
the internet's back!

18:47.292 --> 18:49.161
- What is the wi-fi
password?

18:49.228 --> 18:51.296

18:57.536 --> 19:00.339
So beat it and let me
stare at my phone!

19:04.009 --> 19:06.612
- Kid! I did it!

19:06.678 --> 19:07.713
I punched the virus

right outta that guy,

19:09.648 --> 19:14.453
and then everything...
...reversed... itself...

19:16.788 --> 19:18.290
What's wrong?

19:25.397 --> 19:26.665
- How are your legs?

- They hurt. A lot.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.801
How's your powers?

19:31.336 --> 19:33.272
- I'm still
running the tests...

19:33.338 --> 19:35.607
- So, what are we
gonna do with Rick Twitler?

19:35.674 --> 19:39.611
- I dunno, that computer
virus scrambled his brain.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.380

that you're Captain Man?

19:41.446 --> 19:42.614
That Henry
is Kid Danger?-

19:42.681 --> 19:44.950

attacked Henry's house?

19:57.696 --> 19:58.997
Don't they know that
he's Kid Danger?

19:59.064 --> 20:00.232
- Nah, they were
just hired goons.

20:00.299 --> 20:01.500
They know less than he does.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.669
- So...everything's
back to normal.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.237
- Not everything.

- Yeah Schwoz, what's
going on, man?
