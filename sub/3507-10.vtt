00:33.750 --> 00:34.799
A stabbing, rick?

00:34.800 --> 00:36.759
Isn't that a little pedestrian for you?

00:36.760 --> 00:38.549
Usually when you call me, it's to ask what happens

00:38.550 --> 00:42.040
- If you put a head in a microwave.
- Well, this one's a little less made-Up.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.299
The victim is the mother

00:44.300 --> 00:46.720
Of the detective i've been following around. Ah.

00:48.850 --> 00:50.869
The case has been cold ten years.

00:50.870 --> 00:53.012
I just figured, since you're the best forensic pathologist

00:53.012 --> 00:53.552
In the city,

00:53.587 --> 00:55.059
Maybe you could catch something they missed.

00:55.060 --> 00:57.879
You know reality isn't fiction, right?

00:57.880 --> 01:01.019
- The odds of finding anyone's killer after ten years
- Astronomical, i know.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.040
But i'd appreciate it if you took a look.

01:04.519 --> 01:06.439
Well, i'll do what i can.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.329
Just don't go making any promises i can't keep.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.590
Of course not.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.439
- Thanks again.
- Get back to you as soon as i can.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.680
I appreciate it.

01:19.060 --> 01:21.730
What was dr. Death doing here?

01:21.840 --> 01:22.979
Just a little consulting.

01:22.980 --> 01:24.829
It sounded to me like you were looking into

01:24.830 --> 01:27.310
Detective beckett's mother's murder.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.189
- Must you always eavesdrop?
- I wasn't eavesdropping.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.079
I happened to walk by your office door.

01:32.080 --> 01:36.000
- I live here, too, you know.
- Yes. I'm aware.

01:36.340 --> 01:39.849
So does she know you're poking into her mother's case?

01:39.850 --> 01:42.440
What's the sense in telling her until i find something new?

01:42.800 --> 01:46.370
Well, you ever stop to think you're invading her privacy?

01:46.380 --> 01:48.339
I'm not poking through her underwear drawer.

01:48.340 --> 01:50.289
I'm investigating her mother's murder.

01:50.290 --> 01:52.159
You are digging up her past, darling,

01:52.160 --> 01:53.429
Without her permission.

01:53.430 --> 01:57.240
Now you either tell her or leave it alone.
Oh, my gosh, dad!

01:57.750 --> 01:59.350
Dad, dad, dad!
What is it?

01:59.750 --> 02:02.960
I dad, he asked me! Dad, he asked me!

02:03.240 --> 02:05.399
Who asked you?
Owen. But i told him i had to ask you.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.079
But you'll say yes, right? 'Cause i told him yes.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.339
But you have to say yes, so say yes!
Yes?

02:09.340 --> 02:10.600
Yes!

02:11.850 --> 02:14.969
What am i saying yes to?
The junior-Senior prom.

02:14.970 --> 02:17.659
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You are not a junior

02:17.660 --> 02:20.470
Nor a senior.
True, but owen's a junior.

02:20.590 --> 02:24.609
Owen? I thought you said he was only 15.
Yeah, he skipped a grade. But he's so cute, dad.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.870
Please, please, please.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.340
If i say yes,

02:32.700 --> 02:34.339
Have a good time?
Yes!

02:34.340 --> 02:37.679
Inot-Not too good a time.
Dad, all we've done is hold hands.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.980
Ew, okay, please. Don't need details. Just...

02:40.700 --> 02:42.150
So i can go?

02:42.200 --> 02:45.970
Of course you can go.
Oh! I love you.

02:46.010 --> 02:48.109
Oh! I'm gonna need a dress.
Of course.

02:48.110 --> 02:50.140
A beautiful dress. A dress, a dress, a dress!

02:50.220 --> 02:53.770
Thanks, dad!
So do you like this... owen?

02:54.160 --> 02:57.089
I don't know. I haven't met him.
You are letting her go out with someone

02:57.090 --> 02:58.410
That you've never met-

02:59.330 --> 03:01.500
What kind of a father are you?

03:06.420 --> 03:09.509
I'm not running a background check on your daughter's date.

03:09.510 --> 03:11.039
Oh, come on. She says he's quiet,

03:11.040 --> 03:12.989
He keeps to himself, and he lives with his parents.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.819
Tell me that doesn't sound like a serial killer to you.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.059
Who's a serial killer?
Castle's daughter alexis got invited to prom.

03:18.060 --> 03:21.089
It's her first real date.
And you're worried he's a serial killer?

03:21.090 --> 03:24.410
You should be more worried he's a teenage boy.
Ah, he's only 15.

03:25.270 --> 03:26.909
Between satellite tv and the internet,

03:26.910 --> 03:30.259
15's the new 25.
Dude's right. I was 15 once.

03:30.260 --> 03:32.229
Still are.
If i had a daughter her age,

03:32.230 --> 03:34.599
I'd never let her out of the house.
Thanks, guys.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.420
Mm-Hmm. Car was towed in a few hours ago-Parking violations.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.209
When the attendant went to look for the vin number,

03:40.210 --> 03:42.910
He found the vic slumped over with a bag on his head.

03:44.810 --> 03:47.219
Six parking tickets and a tow sticker,

03:47.220 --> 03:48.899
And no one bothers to look inside?

03:48.900 --> 03:50.919
Tinted windows, sunshade on the windshield.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.179
You'd think someone would try to at least look inside.

03:53.180 --> 03:57.009
Yeah, welcome to new york. You got an i.D.?

03:57.010 --> 04:00.230
Yeah, dr. Joshua leeds, 37.

04:00.420 --> 04:02.378
According to the business cards in his wallet,

04:02.926 --> 04:04.214
He's a plastic surgeon.

04:04.380 --> 04:05.769
The car is also registered to him as well.

04:05.770 --> 04:09.110
Any money in the wallet?
Yeah, couple of hundred bucks.

04:09.670 --> 04:12.640
Well, i guess we can rule out robbery.

04:12.740 --> 04:14.149
A plastic bag and duct tape-

04:14.150 --> 04:15.999
Not a very efficient way to kill someone.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.459
No, but it's very personal.

04:19.470 --> 04:21.399
All right, find and notify next of kin.

04:21.399 --> 04:25.419
Let's see how long he's been missing.
From the state of decay, i'd say about a week.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.699
That matches the date on the first parking ticket.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.479
Preliminary cause of death indicates asphyxiation,

04:30.480 --> 04:32.819
But i'll run toxicology just in case.

04:32.820 --> 04:35.900
That bag's pretty thin. Why wouldn't he just rip it off?

04:36.280 --> 04:39.910
He must've been restrained.
That's only half the story.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.589
His fingernails were removed.

04:42.590 --> 04:44.089
And each finger presents signs

04:44.090 --> 04:46.439
Of having been broken premortem.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.409
Broken?

04:47.410 --> 04:49.479
If i had to guess, i'd say our doctor was tortured

04:49.480 --> 04:51.260
Before he was killed.

04:56.423 --> 05:00.396

Áéêéãîì¸ µúò»¼¾µú10¼¯</font>

05:06.290 --> 05:08.809
His fiancée courtney morantz.

05:08.810 --> 05:10.970
She reported him missing a week ago.

05:11.130 --> 05:14.379
C.S.U. Have any luck with the car?
They're running prints, testing fibers.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.679
We should have results by tomorrow.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.110
All right, thanks.

05:17.180 --> 05:18.460
Mm-Hmm.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.020
Ms. Morantz, i'm kate beckett.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.809
I'm the detective working on your fianc?S case..

05:25.810 --> 05:28.000
I'm very sorry about your loss.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.560
I was wondering if i could take a moment of your time.

05:31.780 --> 05:33.090
I knew it.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.960
When he didn't come home, i just felt it.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.980
How long were you engaged?

05:38.590 --> 05:39.859
Almost a year.

05:39.860 --> 05:43.060
We were gonna get married next month, at the gardens.

05:44.330 --> 05:45.649
What did they want, money?

05:45.650 --> 05:47.960
It doesn't appear to be a robbery.

05:48.950 --> 05:50.469
Then why?

05:50.470 --> 05:52.409
Was josh involved in anything that might've brought him

05:52.410 --> 05:56.639
Into contact with criminal elements?
No. No, not my josh.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.099
That's just not who he was.

05:58.100 --> 05:58.889
On the day he disappeared,

05:58.890 --> 06:01.999
Did you notice anything different about him?
Uh, different?

06:02.000 --> 06:06.360
Did he seem worried or scared or distracted?

06:06.510 --> 06:07.229
He was fine.

06:07.230 --> 06:09.170
I mean, we were gonna meet,

06:09.650 --> 06:12.350
Because we were gonna go taste some cakes.

06:13.350 --> 06:16.189
When he didn't show, i called the office

06:16.190 --> 06:18.129
And they said he'd left, so i called his cell phone,

06:18.130 --> 06:21.069
But he didn't pick up.
If his office was in midtown,

06:21.070 --> 06:22.169
Do you have any idea

06:22.170 --> 06:27.190
Why his car would be found on 133rd street?
133rd street?

06:27.210 --> 06:28.629
He'd never go that far north.

06:28.630 --> 06:31.530
He always took the midtown tunnel to the l.I.E.

06:31.660 --> 06:34.010
And if he was gonna be late, he'd call.

06:35.530 --> 06:37.449
He'd always call.

06:37.450 --> 06:39.720
He'd always let me know.

06:43.010 --> 06:45.479
Anything on the canvass?
Nada.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.799
Ilocals only remember seeing the car after the tickets.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.900
No security cameras on the street.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.109
Fiancée's story checks out.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.929
Cake shop confirms she was there waiting.

06:52.930 --> 06:55.579
Heading to meet his fiancée at a cake shop in great neck,

06:55.580 --> 07:00.509
How'd he wind up dead on a street in harlem?
Well, maybe he had secrets even his fiancée didn't know about.

07:00.510 --> 07:02.469
Like maybe he secretly made a living out of

07:02.470 --> 07:05.269
Using his surgeon skills to harvest organs off of tourists

07:05.270 --> 07:07.029
For the black market organ trade.

07:07.030 --> 07:12.489
Whoa, that was a good one. I'm writing that down.
So instead of making up stories,

07:12.490 --> 07:14.930
We are going to establish a timeline.

07:15.180 --> 07:16.980
When did he get his first ticket?

07:16.990 --> 07:19.459
Last wednesday morning. Okay, so you guys go to the midtown garage

07:19.460 --> 07:21.329
Where he kept his car, and we'll hit his office.

07:21.330 --> 07:22.700
Cool.
Okay.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.530
Hey, can i ask you something?

07:26.730 --> 07:29.659
Since when do you ask permission to ask questions?

07:29.660 --> 07:31.310
It's about your mother's case.

07:33.100 --> 07:36.560
Have you ever thought about... reopening it?

07:38.520 --> 07:40.050
What are you doing?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.100
Nothing. I just thought if we worked together
- No.

07:44.910 --> 07:48.859
I have resources.
Castle, you touch my mom's case,

07:48.860 --> 07:50.890
And you and i are done.

07:51.590 --> 07:53.140
Do you understand?

07:54.380 --> 07:55.600
Okay.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.320
Why don't you want to investigate it?

08:07.170 --> 08:07.999
Same reason

08:08.000 --> 08:10.790
A recovering alcoholic doesn't drink.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.761
You don't think i haven't been down there?

08:13.761 --> 08:14.261
You don't think

08:14.261 --> 08:17.630
I haven't memorized every line in that file?

08:17.930 --> 08:20.139
My first three years on the force,

08:20.140 --> 08:22.619
Every off-Duty moment was spent looking

08:22.620 --> 08:25.200
For something someone missed.

08:26.110 --> 08:27.979
It took me a year of therapy to realize

08:27.980 --> 08:30.539
If i didn't let it go, it was gonna destroy me.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.820
And so i let it go.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.659
Sorry.

08:43.659 --> 08:45.030
I didn't know.

08:45.060 --> 08:47.510
???????Like you do

09:00.820 --> 09:02.060
Well, this must be the place.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.279
Hmm?

09:04.280 --> 09:05.949
What is it with men and boobs, anyway?

09:05.950 --> 09:07.529
It's biological. We can't help it.

09:07.530 --> 09:08.669
But doesn't it bother you

09:08.670 --> 09:11.280
That they're so obviously not real?

09:11.870 --> 09:15.010
Santa's not real. We still love opening his presents.

09:16.030 --> 09:18.369
It wasn't like him to disappear.

09:18.370 --> 09:20.770
I think that, deep down, we all knew that, um,

09:21.550 --> 09:22.939
That something was wrong.

09:22.940 --> 09:27.079
Did he seem agitated at all?
No, i mean, it was pretty much business as usual.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.339
Except for the wedding.

09:28.340 --> 09:30.319
We were trying to clear his schedule for the honeymoon.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.569
When was the last time you saw him?
Last tuesday. He was on his way to meet his fiancée.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.639
What time did he leave the office?
Um...

09:37.640 --> 09:39.029
Around 5:30.
Yeah.

09:39.030 --> 09:41.009
When i called at 6:00, he was fine.

09:41.010 --> 09:45.090
He said he was in traffic at the tunnel.
He'd left manhattan then.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.200
Why would he come back?

09:48.220 --> 09:50.169
Did dr. Leeds have any enemies,

09:50.170 --> 09:53.289
Anyone that he had operated on who had had complications

09:53.290 --> 09:54.569
Or a bad experience?

09:54.570 --> 09:57.159
None of his patients had complications.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.350
That doesn't mean that they were always happy.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.429
Cosmetic surgery is about self-Image.

10:02.430 --> 10:03.999
For some people, it changes their lives.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.799
For others, nothing's ever enough.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.589
Did any of his patients ever threaten him?

10:08.590 --> 10:11.899
One. Jacey goldberg.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.439
She was a patient of dr. Leeds until about three months ago.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.299
What happened?
She wanted a face-Lift.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.820
So?
So she already had three,

10:20.060 --> 10:22.409
And dr. Leeds refused to perform the operation.

10:22.410 --> 10:25.110
So what'd she do?
She sued him.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.489
It was thrown out of court, of course.

10:27.490 --> 10:30.130
That's when the threats started.

10:32.390 --> 10:34.310
Oh.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.139
At the very least, she should be arrested

10:37.140 --> 10:38.669
For violating the laws of nature.

10:38.670 --> 10:41.819
Check this out- Jacey goldberg's husband jack

10:41.820 --> 10:43.619
Had her committed to bellevue a month ago

10:43.620 --> 10:46.279
For psychiatric treatment for her little obsession.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.700
Guess who testified in support of her commitment?

10:49.060 --> 10:52.319
Dr. Joshua leeds.
Mm-Hmm. Mandatory 1- Month treatment program.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.429
She was released last week.
Three days before our doctor went missing.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.659
Mentally unstable plastic surgery chick.

10:57.660 --> 11:00.750
That is way better than harvesting organs.
Get her in here.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.090
Wow.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.040
Look at her.

11:06.820 --> 11:09.900
How can anyone do that to themselves? Right?

11:09.990 --> 11:11.859
It's like she escaped from "the island of dr. Moreau."

11:11.860 --> 11:14.009
Come on, guys, she's not an animal.

11:14.010 --> 11:15.049
She's a human being.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.680
Yeah, i know, but...

11:17.000 --> 11:19.310
Wait, are you being sincere or quoting "the elephant man"?

11:20.060 --> 11:22.000
Oh. Saucy.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.199
Mrs. Goldberg, i'm detective beckett.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.079
This is richard castle, a consultant

11:28.080 --> 11:30.499
With the department. What's this all about, detective?

11:30.500 --> 11:33.599
Mrs. Goldberg, are you familiar with a plastic surgeon

11:33.600 --> 11:35.349
Named dr. Joshua leeds?

11:35.350 --> 11:36.169
Yes.

11:36.170 --> 11:39.399
You recently sued him for malpractice.
That's correct.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.659
"For refusing to perform elective cosmetic surgery,

11:41.660 --> 11:44.189
"Specifically a face-Lift, facial implants

11:44.190 --> 11:47.069
And liposuction."
I can assure you,

11:47.070 --> 11:49.379
Each procedure was medically necessary.

11:49.380 --> 11:53.569
Dr. Leeds didn't seem to think so.
Well, that arrogant bastard thought he could play god.

11:53.570 --> 11:55.299
Well, if you wanted the surgery so badly,

11:55.300 --> 11:57.310
Why didn't you just see another lips?

11:57.530 --> 11:59.380
Doc-Doctor.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.089
Because i wanted the best.

12:02.090 --> 12:06.450
Who is he to deny me the best?
So you threatened to ruin him.

12:06.550 --> 12:07.689
Why does he get to tell me

12:07.690 --> 12:09.610
What i can and cannot do?

12:09.740 --> 12:14.019
Why does he get to decide what i look like?
Is that why you killed him?

12:14.020 --> 12:16.619
What? Dr. Leeds was murdered last week.

12:16.620 --> 12:19.269
Murdered?
A couple of days after you were released

12:19.270 --> 12:20.859
From the psychiatric treatment facility

12:20.860 --> 12:22.649
That leeds helped commit you to.

12:22.650 --> 12:25.370
That's motive and opportunity, counselor.

12:25.510 --> 12:28.199
I said i'd ruin him, not kill him. Big difference.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.479
Then i suppose you won't mind telling me

12:29.480 --> 12:31.430
Where you were last tuesday night.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.350
So where was she?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.639
She was... in the hospital.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.530
Getting more surgery?
Yep.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.830
What's she got left to operate on?

12:45.020 --> 12:46.889
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

12:46.890 --> 12:48.999
Seriously? What could they possibly do down there?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.860
Well, apparently, quite a lot. Ugh.

12:52.890 --> 12:55.069
But if leeds had a reputation of turning people away,

12:55.070 --> 12:57.889
Maybe there's someone else out there he pissed off.
Yeah, esposito and ryan are already looking

12:57.890 --> 12:59.059
Through the patient list,

12:59.060 --> 13:01.149
But the c.S.U. Came back clean from the car.

13:01.150 --> 13:03.349
It would be almost impossible for a run-Of-The-Mill

13:03.350 --> 13:05.019
Revenge murderer to be that invisible.

13:05.020 --> 13:06.939
You thinking it's professional?
I don't know.

13:06.940 --> 13:09.249
Mrs. Goldberg had enough money to pay someone to do it,

13:09.250 --> 13:11.890
And her surgery is a pretty convenient alibi.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.429
But torture and suffocation? That doesn't seem like the work

13:14.430 --> 13:18.839
Of a disgruntled trophy wife turning 50.
A surgeon with broken fingers?

13:18.840 --> 13:21.040
That's someone sending a message.

13:28.410 --> 13:29.980
What do you think?

13:30.530 --> 13:31.739
You look beautiful.

13:31.740 --> 13:33.979
Dad, you say that about every dress.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.279
Don't you think this makes my skin look pasty?

13:36.280 --> 13:37.629
Sweetheart, i want you to know,

13:37.630 --> 13:39.469
No matter how you think you look,

13:39.470 --> 13:44.009
You are perfect exactly the way you are.
You're not helping.

13:44.010 --> 13:46.639
Oh, god. No. Hideous.
Thank you.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.419
Here. Try this.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.410
All right. Good color for you.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.189
What are you doing?
What?

13:56.190 --> 13:57.649
"You look hideous"? Are you trying

13:57.650 --> 14:01.939
To give her body-Image issues?
Oh. News flash-She already has body-Image issues.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.629
It's an intrinsic part of being a woman.

14:03.630 --> 14:04.529
Every woman in the world

14:04.530 --> 14:07.049
Has some part of herself that she absolutely hates.

14:07.050 --> 14:09.339
Her hands are too small, her feet are too big,

14:09.340 --> 14:12.459
Her hair's too straight, too curly, her ears stick out,

14:12.460 --> 14:15.269
Her-Oh, god- Her butt's too flat,

14:15.270 --> 14:17.769
Her nose is too big, and, you know,

14:17.770 --> 14:20.959
Nothing you can say will change how we feel.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.299
What men don't understand is, the right clothes,

14:24.300 --> 14:26.419
The right shoes, the right makeup just-

14:26.420 --> 14:29.370
It-It hides the flaws we think we have.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.500
They make us look beautiful to ourselves.

14:32.680 --> 14:36.160
That's what makes us look beautiful to others.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.640
Used to be...

14:38.860 --> 14:40.209
All she needed to feel beautiful

14:40.210 --> 14:43.029
Was a pink tutu and a plastic tiara.

14:43.030 --> 14:46.160
We spend our whole lives trying to feel that way again.

14:49.690 --> 14:51.140
Oh.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.510
What do you think?

14:59.831 --> 15:02.168
I think it's you

15:05.880 --> 15:07.699
Staff just went through all the files.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.849
No other red flags. Any dark secrets in here?

15:10.850 --> 15:14.020
Yeah... dr. Leeds had a weakness.

15:14.990 --> 15:16.540
Energy bars.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.339
He volunteered at doctors international,

15:18.340 --> 15:20.219
Did pro bono work. The guy's a boy scout.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.789
Hell, he didn't even have any porn on his computer.
That's weird.

15:22.790 --> 15:26.570
I know. You know what he had in his locked desk drawer?
A fifth of scotch?

15:26.860 --> 15:30.429
Checkbook. The guy locked up his checkbook.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.369
What about these folders?
Wedding stuff-

15:33.370 --> 15:36.189
Tux deposits, catering invoices.

15:36.190 --> 15:37.509
Maybe some angry couple killed him

15:37.510 --> 15:39.279
For their wedding venue, hmm?

15:39.280 --> 15:40.970
It's as good a theory as any.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.640
Hey.

15:45.030 --> 15:46.740
These aren't all wedding files.

15:51.420 --> 15:52.990
That's odd.

15:53.530 --> 15:56.010
All the patient information is blacked out.

15:56.420 --> 15:59.170
Maybe dr. Leeds has a secret after all.

16:02.190 --> 16:04.190
It's his handwriting, but...

16:04.310 --> 16:06.430
I've never seen this file before.

16:06.430 --> 16:08.470
Can you identify that patient?

16:08.750 --> 16:10.399
Not from his notes.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.979
Just that it was a male, 55 years old.

16:12.980 --> 16:15.040
How about this kind of procedure?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.199
This is impossible. I'm his primary nurse.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.489
I run his surgical team. He never operates without me.

16:21.490 --> 16:22.930
Apparently, he did.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.809
Mario, check on dr. Leeds' calendar.

16:25.810 --> 16:28.820
What do you have for march 18th?

16:29.520 --> 16:32.649
He... was supposed to be down at mercy

16:32.650 --> 16:35.110
Attending a panel on reconstructive surgery.

16:37.380 --> 16:39.260
Why would he lie?

16:39.720 --> 16:41.560
Why would he operate without me?

16:41.560 --> 16:44.199
According to the hospital, the procedure lasted nine hours.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.999
Neither the assisting nor the anesthesiologist

16:46.000 --> 16:47.379
Were with the hospital.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.079
Both were brought in by dr. Leeds.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.799
Neither of his regulars.
A 9-Hour mystery operation

16:52.800 --> 16:54.439
He didn't want his own people to know about.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.979
The hospital must've had some record of the patient.

16:56.980 --> 16:59.429
Get this-The hospital can't find the file.

16:59.430 --> 17:01.549
It's like it never happened.
Who did you talk to?

17:01.550 --> 17:04.608
Patient information.
Well... that was your first mistake.

17:04.609 --> 17:06.339
If you want to find someone at a hospital

17:06.339 --> 17:08.409
Who had a treatment there, there's only one department

17:08.410 --> 17:11.520
Ito go to where nothing ever falls through the cracks.

17:13.020 --> 17:14.459
Billing.

17:14.460 --> 17:16.440
Someone had to pay for it, right?

17:23.359 --> 17:24.319
Thank you.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.060
No, i appreciate it.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.169
Well, it looks like

17:28.170 --> 17:29.739
Our mystery patient's hospital bills

17:29.740 --> 17:32.329
Were paid promptly and in full.
By whom?

17:32.330 --> 17:35.409
Wire transfer. Esposito.
Yeah.

17:35.410 --> 17:37.549
See what you can find on this account number.
All right.

17:37.550 --> 17:41.540
So did alexis find a dress yet?
Yeah, yeah. A cute one, too.

17:41.910 --> 17:45.759
Boy. I can't believe my little girl's going to prom.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.009
My only comfort now is the long-Standing tradition

17:48.010 --> 17:50.809
Of torturing the boyfriend.
What do you mean?

17:50.810 --> 17:53.719
You know, the time-Honored hazing that goes on

17:53.720 --> 17:56.339
In those few moments we share where he and i are alone

17:56.340 --> 17:58.900
Just before my daughter descends the stairs.

17:58.980 --> 18:01.429
I remember the terror of meeting my date's old man.

18:01.430 --> 18:05.249
What did he do?
Checked my wallet for condoms, showed me his gun collection.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.099
My hands were shaking so bad, i could barely put on the corsage.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.590
What'd your dad do?

18:09.830 --> 18:13.689
I... i don't know. I was in my room.

18:13.690 --> 18:16.799
How was your date when you finally came out?
You know, actually,

18:16.800 --> 18:20.089
Now that you mention it, he looked terrified.

18:20.090 --> 18:21.799
And this whole time, i thought he was scared of me.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.669
Nope. And now it's my turn.

18:24.670 --> 18:28.900
What are you planning?
Something befitting the name of castle.

18:30.270 --> 18:31.749
Yo, you're never gonna believe this.

18:31.750 --> 18:34.629
What'd you find?
That account the money was wired from?

18:34.630 --> 18:36.559
It belongs to the u.S. Attorney's office.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.539
Whatever the procedure was, uncle sam paid for it.

18:39.540 --> 18:41.089
I guess we can rule out boob job.

18:41.090 --> 18:43.699
Why would the d.O.J. Pay for a cosmetic procedure?

18:43.700 --> 18:47.399
There's only one reason- To change someone's identity.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.379
So you think the guy was in witness protection?

18:49.380 --> 18:51.719
If dr. Leeds was tortured, i think our killer is trying

18:51.720 --> 18:53.679
To find this guy. Then we better find him first.

18:53.680 --> 18:59.330
How do you find someone who's in witness protection?
We ask the people who are protecting him.

18:59.870 --> 19:02.269
Ask "hard candy"?
Good luck.

19:02.270 --> 19:05.969
Hard-Hard candy?
Assistant u.S. Attorney candace robinson.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.059
She makes mobsters cry.

19:08.060 --> 19:10.199
I'm sorry, detective, but you must know that

19:10.200 --> 19:12.779
Information on a protected witness is confidential.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.149
Whether or not you have proof that we employed dr. Leeds

19:15.150 --> 19:17.339
Or whether or not you have proof that an operation took place

19:17.340 --> 19:18.660
Is irrelevant.

19:19.910 --> 19:22.160
Not to my victim it's not.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.349
Not to his family

19:24.350 --> 19:26.249
And certainly not to his fiancée.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.779
They were planning a life together

19:27.780 --> 19:29.540
That they will never have.

19:30.030 --> 19:32.419
Look, i am not unsympathetic to your situation,

19:32.420 --> 19:34.380
But we all have our jobs to do.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.869
Ms. Robinson, doesn't it matter to you

19:36.870 --> 19:39.249
That the man that you employed was killed

19:39.250 --> 19:42.930
And whoever murdered him might be looking for your witness?

19:43.430 --> 19:44.539
Detective,

19:44.540 --> 19:46.259
You are asking me to expose a witness

19:46.260 --> 19:48.559
During an ongoing federal investigation,

19:48.560 --> 19:50.920
And i am telling you, that is not going to happen.

19:51.610 --> 19:54.019
So what now?
This witness of theirs is key.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.209
Without knowing who he is or who's after him,

19:56.210 --> 19:59.279
There's no way of getting to the next step.
There's another way

19:59.280 --> 20:02.009
We could figure out who that witness is.
Yeah? How?

20:02.010 --> 20:04.199
Candace robinson's office deals almost exclusively

20:04.200 --> 20:05.969
With organized crime.
So?

20:05.970 --> 20:07.750
So what if we ask the other side?

20:07.880 --> 20:11.959
You want to ask the mob who the witness is?
Clearly, they already know who he is

20:11.960 --> 20:13.189
If they're trying to kill him.

20:13.190 --> 20:14.889
Like you said, he's got to be a significant witness

20:14.890 --> 20:17.159
In a pretty big case.
So what do we do, hop in the car,

20:17.160 --> 20:19.970
Drive down to the bada bing?
I know a guy. He owes me a favor.

20:20.130 --> 20:25.339
You "know a guy"? What is this, a mamet play?
From the early days of derrick storm.

20:25.340 --> 20:26.839
He's a capo with one of the families.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.949
He's actually pretty nice.
For a criminal.

20:28.950 --> 20:30.949
I'm just saying, maybe he knows something.

20:30.950 --> 20:33.620
Maybe he can tell us something the feds won't.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.090
I keep forgetting you read plays.

20:53.740 --> 20:55.639
Oh! Whoa! I'm-I'm a friend!

20:55.640 --> 20:57.309
I'm a friend.
Sal?

20:57.310 --> 20:59.799
Take him out back. Kill him.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.329
Sal, whoa! Oh! Sal! Whoa, you're go-

21:03.330 --> 21:05.009
It's-It's me, buddy.
Vito! Vito, wait! Vito, wait!

21:05.010 --> 21:08.490
Hold up. I was just messing with him.

21:10.750 --> 21:11.970
Sorry, man.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.149
Not funny, sal.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.019
Oh, you're right. No, it wasn't funny.

21:17.020 --> 21:19.870
It was frickin' hilarious!

21:20.640 --> 21:22.529
Richard frickin' castle-

21:22.530 --> 21:24.850
Master of the macabre. Ha.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.680
What brings you down off your cloud of money?

21:30.600 --> 21:31.800
Thank you.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.079
The guy you're talkin' about-

21:35.080 --> 21:36.859
He worked for the spolano family.

21:36.860 --> 21:40.039
Jimmy "the rat" moran. He was an underboss.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.519
He was a favorite of the old man's, but he got

21:42.520 --> 21:45.200
Squeezed out by junior when the old man bit it.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.359
Rumor has it that he turned state's a few months ago,

21:48.360 --> 21:50.559
And the spolanos are running scared.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.129
Apparently, moran's got it all- Bills of lading, calendars,

21:54.130 --> 21:55.539
Ledgers, the whole shooting match.

21:55.540 --> 21:59.790
Enough to take down all the top guys.
Well, no wonder he wanted to change his face.

22:00.140 --> 22:01.349
Hey, if they got to the surgeon,

22:01.350 --> 22:03.760
It's only a matter of time before they get to him.

22:04.270 --> 22:07.019
When i wrote "storm warning"
- Oh, i love that book.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.250
Thank you. Mm-Hmm.

22:08.710 --> 22:10.389
You told me that certain mob hit men

22:10.390 --> 22:13.419
Have signature styles or weapons.
That's right.

22:13.420 --> 22:16.489
Okay, well, this killer used a plastic bag with duct tape

22:16.490 --> 22:17.689
To suffocate his victim.

22:17.690 --> 22:19.420
Does that sound like anyone you know?

22:19.730 --> 22:23.630
You'd have to ask the spolanos about that one.
Yeah, i don't think they'd like that.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.270
Heh. Probably not.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.649
I bet you i know somebody else who might know.
Who?

22:28.650 --> 22:30.310
Jimmy the rat.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.649
Jimmy "the rat" moran, a.K.A. Jimmy pretty.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.999
He's been linked to gambling, loan sharking

22:38.000 --> 22:39.359
And extortion schemes.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.879
You know, you want a guy to be loyal,

22:40.880 --> 22:44.591
You probably shouldn't nickname him "the rat."
Okay, let's start off by digging up

22:44.591 --> 22:48.195
All known associates of the spolano family.
Yeah, sure, and while we're at it,

22:48.195 --> 22:49.489
We'll just bang our heads against a brick wall,

22:49.490 --> 22:53.579
You know, just for fun.
Professional hits are the hardest to close.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.779
Because of the anonymous nature of the murders, the usual rules

22:56.780 --> 22:59.189
Like motive and relationship to victim don't apply.

22:59.190 --> 23:02.139
We need to talk to moran. Gotta see what he knows.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.470
Yeah.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.729
What makes you think your friend "hard candy"

23:06.730 --> 23:07.959
Is going to cooperate with you now?

23:07.960 --> 23:10.310
You have your sources. I have mine.

23:10.410 --> 23:12.209
Oh, it's not your ex-Boyfriend, is it?

23:12.210 --> 23:15.069
Mr. Fbi-Tall, brooding and judgmental?

23:15.070 --> 23:18.019
Why, yes, in fact, it is. Is that a problem?
No. Not for me.

23:18.020 --> 23:19.819
But then again, i'm not the one

23:19.820 --> 23:21.650
He's trying to get back together with.

23:30.570 --> 23:31.819
Well, this is a nice surprise.

23:31.820 --> 23:34.730
Yeah? Hopefully, this is a nice surprise as well.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.440
Sprinkles. Am i really that predictable?

23:39.520 --> 23:41.830
Well, maybe i just know you too well.

23:42.090 --> 23:43.759
I mean, we did date once.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.740
Yeah.

23:46.250 --> 23:50.210
Oh, no, thanks. I don't eat sprinkles anymore.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.179
Right.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.419
So, kate, is this the part where you

23:55.420 --> 23:58.380
Ask me to bend the rules to help you on your case?

23:59.340 --> 24:01.069
Am i really that predictable?

24:01.070 --> 24:03.470
Imaybe i just know you too well.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.800
What do you need?

24:08.480 --> 24:10.330
I wanna talk to jimmy moran.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.880
Jimmy moran the mobster?
Yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.080
What makes you think i can help with that?

24:17.150 --> 24:19.319
The fbi and the u.S. Attorney's office

24:19.320 --> 24:23.199
Have him in witness protection.
And you know this how?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.680
Word on the street.

24:26.070 --> 24:29.190
Look, even if it's true,

24:29.270 --> 24:31.529
I don't work organized crime cases.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.819
Oh, come on, will, you and i both know how this works.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.529
You reach out to the agent in charge,

24:35.530 --> 24:37.919
He talks to the a.U.S.A. Running the case,

24:37.920 --> 24:43.020
And then i get to talk to jimmy moran.
And i do this for you why?

24:43.400 --> 24:45.190
All right, let me put this another way.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.889
The spolanos know

24:46.890 --> 24:49.379
That jimmy is cooperating with the government.

24:49.380 --> 24:50.669
We know that they want him dead

24:50.670 --> 24:52.009
Because they murdered the surgeon

24:52.010 --> 24:54.329
You feds hired to change his face.

24:54.330 --> 24:56.239
You guys put that doctor in harm's way,

24:56.240 --> 24:58.440
So you're doing it for him, not for me.

25:06.420 --> 25:09.920
This is it. Don't be nervous.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.699
Dad! No! No severed heads.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.849
That's-I- It's time-Honored.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.289
No! Richard... really.

25:20.290 --> 25:23.280
Take it off. Come on.

25:23.950 --> 25:25.400
Fine.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.439
Hi.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.240
Hi. Wow, you look, uh,

25:39.560 --> 25:40.669
Really nice.

25:40.670 --> 25:42.039
Thanks. You, too.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.629
Baby, find the lens. Dad.

25:44.630 --> 25:45.980
Shh. Pretend i'm not here. Oh...

25:46.380 --> 25:48.379
Uh, dad, gram, this is owen.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.019
Hi. Delighted.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.700
Hi. Hi. A pleasure.

25:51.920 --> 25:56.010
Oh, don't they look adorable? And... a corsage.

25:56.230 --> 25:58.889
Oh, uh, here. It, uh, it goes on your wrist.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.229
Oh, okay. Oh, thanks.

26:00.230 --> 26:01.309
Oh...

26:01.310 --> 26:03.319
It's beautiful.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.399
Uh, ready? Yeah.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.469
Yeah, okay. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

26:06.470 --> 26:08.039
Whoa, that's it? I don't even get a chance to ask him

26:08.040 --> 26:12.260
If he's killed a man? Dad, he hasn't, but i might.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.379
All right, get outta here. Don't do anything i would do.

26:14.380 --> 26:16.259
Bye! Enjoy yourselves.

26:16.260 --> 26:17.750
Have fun! Good-Bye!

26:17.940 --> 26:20.180
Oh... oh...

26:21.930 --> 26:24.179
My little girl- She's all grown-Up.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.829
Yeah, well, at least one of you is. Uh...

26:26.830 --> 26:29.449
A severed head? Ooh, i was just getting started, too.

26:29.450 --> 26:31.070
I was gonna break into my chris walken.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.419
Whoa. Tell me, little man...

26:34.420 --> 26:37.669
Have you ever been to prison? Very funny, very funny.

26:37.670 --> 26:40.140
But leave the acting to me, honey.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.619
Hi. Detective beckett.

26:43.620 --> 26:46.649
I'm so glad you called. Regale me.

26:46.650 --> 26:47.599
Castle?

26:47.600 --> 26:50.679
My chris walken. What do you think? Uh... needs work.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.079
Well, in-In all fairness, part of it's visual.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.519
Listen, sorenson's onboard. He pulled some strings

26:55.520 --> 26:57.459
And got someone at the u.S. Attorney's office to cave.

26:57.460 --> 27:00.219
He's gonna let you question moran. But we gotta be there in an hour. Are you in?

27:00.220 --> 27:03.150
Am i in? Is the pope catholic?

27:04.050 --> 27:05.400
It'll grow on you.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.730
Seriously, a parking garage?

27:08.760 --> 27:09.549
What?

27:09.550 --> 27:11.699
It's... pretty clich?.

27:11.700 --> 27:15.119
Yeah, well, no one said that the feds were original.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.019
Yeah, next thing you'll tell me,

27:16.020 --> 27:17.589
They'll be pulling up in a black suburban

27:17.590 --> 27:19.370
With tinted windows.

27:21.590 --> 27:22.789
Oh, someone's been watching

27:22.790 --> 27:24.830
Way too many bruckheimer films.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.319
Five minutes, detective. That's all you get.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.349
The nypd thanks you for your cooperation.

27:33.350 --> 27:34.699
Want me to watch the monkey?

27:34.700 --> 27:38.460
That's okay. Monkey comes with me. Suit yourself.

27:38.850 --> 27:41.880
Hey, i really like your car. It's very nondescript.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.029
Mr. Moran, i'm detective beckett.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.550
This is richard castle.

27:53.170 --> 27:54.749
Richard castle, like the novelist?

27:54.750 --> 27:58.210
Exactly like. I thought you guys were cops.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.039
He's consulting on the case.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.169
Well, look, i already told the feds everything i know.

28:03.170 --> 28:05.429
You want info on the spolanos, ask them.

28:05.430 --> 28:07.209
Actually, we're not here about the spolanos.

28:07.210 --> 28:10.859
We're here about dr. Leeds, the man who operated on you. What about him?

28:10.860 --> 28:12.569
He was found murdered last week.

28:12.570 --> 28:15.709
Murdered? The doc was murdered?

28:15.710 --> 28:18.829
Asphyxiated. They duct taped a plastic bag over his head.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.170
We believe the spolanos may have been involved.

28:21.270 --> 28:22.940
"May have been"?

28:23.610 --> 28:25.139
"May have been"?!

28:25.140 --> 28:26.459
Given how leeds was killed

28:26.460 --> 28:28.129
And given your knowledge of the organization,

28:28.130 --> 28:30.820
We were hoping that you would be able to help identify the-

28:31.200 --> 28:33.669
Hey! Hey! What's wrong?

28:33.670 --> 28:36.649
Get me out of here! We can help, mr. Moran.

28:36.650 --> 28:38.469
We can find the guys who did this,

28:38.470 --> 28:40.169
But you have to let me know if there was anyone

28:40.170 --> 28:42.629
In the spolano family that kills this way.

28:42.630 --> 28:46.359
Yeah, yeah, there is. Me.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.618
The duct tape, the bag- That was my m.O.

28:48.618 --> 28:50.910
Don't you get it? They're sending a message to me,

28:50.910 --> 28:52.220
And if they got to the doc...

28:52.680 --> 28:56.180
Take me back! Now!

28:56.520 --> 28:57.820
Hey, how'd it go?

28:57.960 --> 29:01.170
Oh, do the words "unmitigated disaster" mean anything?

29:01.170 --> 29:02.530
What happened?

29:02.540 --> 29:04.449
We scared a key witness in a huge federal case

29:04.450 --> 29:07.769
So bad that now he won't testify. Oh, is that all?

29:07.770 --> 29:10.439
Beckett. Just got a call from d.O.J.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.310
Sir, i can explain- No, no. It's-It's sorenson.

29:12.390 --> 29:14.999
On the way back to the fbi safe house with moran,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.240
Someone pulled up next to 'em and opened fire.

29:17.290 --> 29:19.200
He was in the back with the witness.

29:19.870 --> 29:21.680
They were both been shot

29:27.320 --> 29:29.419
Car was a late-Model sedan with dealer plates.

29:29.420 --> 29:30.979
The guy pulls up at a light with a mask on,

29:30.980 --> 29:35.469
Blew the tires, starts shootin' at the back of the vehicle. I thought the glass would be bulletproof.

29:35.470 --> 29:37.359
They used cop killers- Teflon rounds.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.720
Went right through the door.

29:41.150 --> 29:42.640
He's still in surgery.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.690
Moran's gonna be okay, though.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.279
You want to talk?

29:53.280 --> 29:56.129
There's nothing to talk about. I'm the one who pushed for it,

29:56.130 --> 29:59.819
And i'm the one who got will involved. There's no way you could have known this was gonna happen.

29:59.820 --> 30:01.089
Are you sure about that?

30:01.090 --> 30:05.779
Because their vehicle was attacked leaving our meet. So?

30:05.780 --> 30:07.129
So we were followed.

30:07.130 --> 30:09.319
Someone who knew about the investigation

30:09.320 --> 30:10.489
Found out about the meet.

30:10.490 --> 30:13.109
We led them to moran. So yeah, i should've known.

30:13.110 --> 30:15.580
And if i were a better cop, i would've.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.380
You think this is your fault?

30:24.240 --> 30:26.300
Yeah, you pushed for it,

30:26.640 --> 30:30.740
Not because it's your job, but because you care.

30:31.070 --> 30:34.240
Most people come up against a wall, they give up.

30:35.290 --> 30:36.660
Not you.

30:37.790 --> 30:39.930
You don't let go.

30:40.590 --> 30:42.460
You don't back down.

30:43.310 --> 30:45.900
That's what makes you extraordinary.

30:51.920 --> 30:55.390
He's gonna make it. He's gonna be okay.

31:13.510 --> 31:14.780
I, uh,

31:15.030 --> 31:16.400
I had a good time.

31:17.310 --> 31:18.720
Me, too.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.340
Uh... good night.

31:32.430 --> 31:33.810
Night.

31:47.890 --> 31:49.100
Did you have fun?

31:51.390 --> 31:54.170
As a matter of fact, i did.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.670
This dating thing is kind of nice.

31:57.680 --> 31:58.629
How was owen?

31:58.630 --> 32:01.059
Don't worry. I closed my eyes for the kissing part.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.590
Yeah, me, too.

32:04.910 --> 32:06.610
You know you didn't have to wait up.

32:06.810 --> 32:10.610
That's my job. I wait up. I make sure you're all right.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.489
But tonight i realized

32:12.490 --> 32:14.639
I'm not going to be doing it for much longer.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.109
Dad. A couple years, you're gonna go off to college,

32:17.110 --> 32:19.580
You're gonna get married, you're gonna have kids,

32:20.070 --> 32:22.850
And i'm only gonna see you on holidays.

32:22.970 --> 32:24.829
Until some gold digger steals all my money,

32:24.830 --> 32:26.540
But then i get to move in with you.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.009
Wow. I feel like i just lost 30 years of my life.

32:29.010 --> 32:30.889
That's how it happens.

32:30.890 --> 32:35.590
One day you're in tutus, and the next day you're...

32:37.110 --> 32:38.360
Too old for severed heads.

32:38.420 --> 32:40.059
Dad, don't worry.

32:40.060 --> 32:41.109
No matter how old i get,

32:41.110 --> 32:43.360
I'll always be your little girl.

32:44.470 --> 32:45.780
Promise?

32:45.820 --> 32:47.060
Promise.

32:48.370 --> 32:49.750
Thank you.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.079
Now go to bed.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.640
Okay.

33:36.380 --> 33:39.409
Desk officer said she came in at 4:00 this morning.

33:39.410 --> 33:41.239
She's been at the board ever since.

33:41.240 --> 33:43.319
She called us in at 6:00 a.M.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.949
To recheck every person we talked to on the case.

33:45.950 --> 33:49.270
And she's had, like, nine double espressos.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.339
Hey. Been reading on the internet

33:58.340 --> 34:00.119
About this new thing called "sleep."

34:00.120 --> 34:01.730
Supposed to be real good for ya.

34:05.270 --> 34:07.479
When i gave you that little speech last night,

34:07.480 --> 34:08.319
I really didn't mean for you

34:08.320 --> 34:10.250
To go all "beautiful mind" on me.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.759
It wasn't anyone at the u.S. Attorney's office.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.179
They wouldn't need us to find him.

34:14.179 --> 34:17.280
So it had to be someone that we talked to.

34:17.830 --> 34:20.000
You don't think it was my mafia connection?

34:20.050 --> 34:21.379
If he's in a rival family,

34:21.380 --> 34:23.219
Then they would want moran alive to testify

34:23.219 --> 34:24.998
Because if the feds take down the spolanos,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.009
Then the other families can take over their territories.

34:27.010 --> 34:31.369
No, we are looking for someone who had access

34:31.370 --> 34:33.570
To the doctor before we got the case.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.239
So that leaves the fiancée and his staff.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.429
Yeah, except the fiancée is clean,

34:38.429 --> 34:40.649
Alibied and accounted for last night.

34:40.650 --> 34:43.820
Phone records don't indicate any calls to unknown numbers.

34:43.889 --> 34:47.458
I thought you already ran his staff up. We did, and there were no records of anything

34:47.460 --> 34:51.300
That indicate ties to organized crime. What about last night?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.259
Maggie dowd was at dinner with friends.

34:53.260 --> 34:56.009
Mario guerrero worked late packing patient files,

34:56.010 --> 34:57.279
And the senior nurse, julia hammond,

34:57.280 --> 35:01.549
Claims she was home alone. What was mario doing packing patient files last night?

35:01.550 --> 35:03.849
They're closing up shop. Patient files are all going

35:03.850 --> 35:06.139
To new doctors. It's just, doesn't that seem like a weird thing

35:06.140 --> 35:10.249
To be doing on a friday night? Yeah, well, when you're low man on the totem pole,

35:10.250 --> 35:12.359
That's what life is like. People think they can

35:12.360 --> 35:17.299
Call you in to work at 6:00 a.M. On a saturday. Julia hammond and maggie dowd-

35:17.300 --> 35:19.430
How long did they work for dr. Leeds?

35:19.610 --> 35:21.099
Uh, hammond was with him ten years.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.890
Maggie came on a few months back. Why?

35:23.940 --> 35:26.749
Because our low man on the totem pole mario guerrero

35:26.750 --> 35:29.409
Started working for the doctor about a month ago.

35:29.410 --> 35:31.679
We checked him. We even called his nursing school.

35:31.680 --> 35:35.240
He's clean. Check again. They can't all be clean.

35:36.050 --> 35:36.959
Where are you going?

35:36.960 --> 35:40.100
To see if mario was actually at the office friday night.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.169
Detective.

35:43.170 --> 35:45.439
Is everything okay? Mario, i need you to come with me.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.579
Why? We need to ask you some questions.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.300
Did i do something wrong?

35:50.270 --> 35:52.090
Beckett. It's maggie.

35:52.370 --> 35:55.739
What? Maggie. We double-Checked everything,

35:55.740 --> 35:57.372
Even called the nursing schools again.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.399
This time we had 'em send pictures,

35:59.399 --> 36:00.385
And the one of maggie...

36:02.150 --> 36:03.840
It's a different girl.

36:04.250 --> 36:07.749
It's maggie. Where's maggie dowd? She didn't come in today. Why?

36:07.750 --> 36:08.990
Detective?

36:11.260 --> 36:13.539
Is dr. Leeds affiliated with st. Marcus hospital?

36:13.540 --> 36:16.609
Yeah. That's where we do our procedures. If she has a hospital i.D.-

36:16.610 --> 36:20.450
She can finish the job. You're off the hook...

36:22.150 --> 36:23.690
But don't leave town.

36:43.850 --> 36:46.429
Oh. Room's restricted. Need to see your i.D.

36:46.430 --> 36:49.689
Sure. You have a maggie dowd on your list?

36:49.690 --> 36:52.050
She's on the roster. You can let her through.

37:06.810 --> 37:09.770
I gotta say, jimmy, you're a hard man to find.

37:09.840 --> 37:13.640
Took me weeks to even find out that you changed your face.

37:13.860 --> 37:17.509
Sodium thiopental. It's what they use in lethal injections.

37:17.510 --> 37:20.740
It's not as much fun as a plastic bag...

37:21.150 --> 37:24.100
But it does the trick.

37:25.570 --> 37:29.399
Oh, and, uh, i got a message from junior, jimmy.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.350
He says,

37:32.120 --> 37:34.120
"Go to hell."

37:48.940 --> 37:50.290
Hi.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.929
You're under arrest for the murder of dr. Leeds

37:55.930 --> 37:59.460
And the attempted murder of jimmy moran. You're too late.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.680
Oh, no. Oh, god.

38:04.350 --> 38:07.880
Oh, don't worry. It's not attached to anything.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.580
It's like we knew you werere coming.

38:09.740 --> 38:11.459
Attempted murder of a federal witness-

38:11.460 --> 38:14.610
What's that going for these days? 25 to life.

38:23.880 --> 38:24.619
She's all yours.

38:24.620 --> 38:26.229
Looks like you managed to set things right with

38:26.230 --> 38:30.059
The u.S. Attorney's office. She turned state's. When moran recovers,

38:30.060 --> 38:32.139
The feds will have two witnesses against the spolanos.

38:32.140 --> 38:35.779
But only maggie back there can link them to murder. Oh, but her real name is carla dante.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.529
The call her "carla coldblood."

38:37.530 --> 38:40.390
She's been killing for the family for five years now.

38:40.630 --> 38:43.220
When jimmy dropped dime, the spolanos sent their best.

38:43.310 --> 38:46.009
Lady hit man-A real blow for women's rights.

38:46.010 --> 38:49.019
And the real maggie dowd? Works for a hospital in seattle.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.769
She had no idea that they had stolen her identity.

38:51.770 --> 38:53.219
Carla even pulled a recommendation

38:53.220 --> 38:54.569
Off of a job-Hunting site

38:54.570 --> 38:56.669
In order to apply for the position with leeds.

38:56.670 --> 38:59.269
Originally she thought she was gonna get a photograph of moran,

38:59.270 --> 39:02.189
And when she couldn't, she went after leeds. And then when leeds didn't talk, she killed him.

39:02.190 --> 39:05.859
But why stay around the office? If she left before leeds' body was found,

39:05.860 --> 39:08.009
It would have looked suspicious, and she probably didn't think

39:08.010 --> 39:09.699
He'd be sitting around for a week.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.339
Then we showed up, and she waited to see

39:11.340 --> 39:14.249
How far we'd get. That's good work, detective. Very good work.

39:14.250 --> 39:18.669
Thank you, sir. You know, sir, i never thought

39:18.670 --> 39:21.000
That i would be saying this, but...

39:22.460 --> 39:24.730
I don't think i could have done it without castle.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.800
Where is castle, anyway?

39:27.650 --> 39:31.480
The original m.E. Concluded that the stab wounds were random.

39:31.580 --> 39:35.459
Now maybe the killer got lucky, but you see this wound here?

39:35.460 --> 39:36.429
Yeah.

39:36.430 --> 39:39.259
It's a low-Angle thrust to the kidney.

39:39.260 --> 39:42.549
The wound size indicated that the knife was twisted.

39:42.550 --> 39:45.180
Her body would have gone into immediate shock.

39:45.780 --> 39:46.809
What about these?

39:46.810 --> 39:48.719
Well, their angles indicate that they were delivered

39:48.720 --> 39:51.470
Iafter she was immobilized and on the ground.

39:51.700 --> 39:53.720
They're just for show.

39:54.110 --> 39:55.879
This is the one that killed her.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.389
This is sounding less like a random killing,

39:58.390 --> 40:00.460
More like a targeted murder.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.650
There's more.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.949
On a hunch, i checked the city m.E. Files

40:05.950 --> 40:08.420
To see if this was an isolated incident

40:08.720 --> 40:11.389
And found three other stabbings around that time

40:11.390 --> 40:16.309
That the m.E. Working the case dismissed as... random.

40:16.310 --> 40:18.200
Were they related?

40:19.710 --> 40:21.500
Are you sure you want to know?

40:27.750 --> 40:29.680
You have to tell her, you know.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.770
Do you know what this would do to her?

40:32.900 --> 40:35.549
You have information that could lead to her mother's killer.

40:35.550 --> 40:39.080
You can't keep that from her. I know.

40:39.410 --> 40:42.520
But she said if i opened the file, that we'd be through.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.410
It doesn't matter.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.140
She has to know.

41:02.630 --> 41:04.230
No, you didn't.

41:04.510 --> 41:06.530
Stop making me laugh.

41:07.300 --> 41:10.630
Oh, come on. It's not like you've been shot or something.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.330
I thought you were over sprinkles.

41:16.630 --> 41:17.879
Maybe not.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.240
Mm.

41:21.470 --> 41:23.460
It's the writer monkey.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.640
What is he still doing here?

41:26.150 --> 41:28.450
Haven't you finished your book yet?

41:29.130 --> 41:30.630
Last chapter.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.900
Do you have a sec?

41:33.970 --> 41:34.990
Yeah.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.539
Watch it, kate. He likes you.

41:39.540 --> 41:42.230
You'll have to forgive him. He is heavily medicated.

41:46.790 --> 41:49.900
You look awfully serious. Is everything okay?

41:50.140 --> 41:51.520
Take a seat.

41:52.120 --> 41:53.500
What?

41:53.790 --> 41:54.939
Sit down.

41:54.940 --> 41:56.590
Castle, what's going on?

42:00.750 --> 42:03.200
It's about your mother.

42:10.611 --> 42:14.244
