01:33.780 --> 01:35.180
Prince Kenshin,
you must turn back.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.540
Return with us at once.

01:36.580 --> 01:37.780
No!

01:39.380 --> 01:41.740
Give up your weapon.

01:52.620 --> 01:54.940
Do not harm him.
Take him prisoner.

01:54.980 --> 01:57.980
No! You will have to
kill me first.

02:03.380 --> 02:05.580
Take him to the castle.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.540
Mitsu!

03:07.620 --> 03:09.060
Beat it.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.180
All right.

03:57.980 --> 03:59.060
Rock 'n' roll!

04:12.820 --> 04:14.060
Turtle tantrum.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.500
Hold it.
Oh, Raph, come on.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.180
What's going on, Raph?

04:21.220 --> 04:22.180
Nothing.

04:22.180 --> 04:25.180
Have patience, my son.

04:25.220 --> 04:26.500
What are we doing this for?

04:26.540 --> 04:30.260
Day after day, practicing,
killing ourselves, for what?

04:30.260 --> 04:31.220
Oh, Raphael.

04:31.220 --> 04:33.900
Nobody appreciates us.
Nobody sees us.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.260
Nobody even knows
we're alive down here!

04:36.300 --> 04:39.580
Hey, guys.
How's it going?

04:39.620 --> 04:42.700
Hi. Fine.
Good hair day?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.060
Brought you some stuff.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.020
I love stuff.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.580
Goodies!

04:46.620 --> 04:47.580
Later.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.220
Let's see what's in the bags.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.900
OK, here are the keys
to my apartment...

04:52.940 --> 04:54.660
somewhere... stop peeking!

04:54.700 --> 04:56.300
No peeking.

04:56.340 --> 04:57.300
I'm not peeking.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.620
I'm spelunking for pork rinds.

04:58.660 --> 04:59.860
Don't lose them.

05:00.860 --> 05:02.300
God, I need this vacation.

05:02.340 --> 05:03.940
Take us with you, April.

05:03.980 --> 05:05.580
Come on, take us with you.

05:05.620 --> 05:08.220
Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, guys.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.060
My suitcases are very full.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.580
Oh, too bad.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.500
Hey, I didn't forget
about you guys.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.140
I bought a lot of fun stuff
at the flea market for you.

05:17.180 --> 05:18.860
All right!

05:18.900 --> 05:20.340
OK, where's Raph?

05:20.380 --> 05:21.980
He's in another funk.

05:22.020 --> 05:22.940
Again?

05:22.980 --> 05:23.980
A major funk.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.700
Maybe this'll cheer him up.

05:25.740 --> 05:26.820
Hey, smooth.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.020
Pretty cool, huh?

05:28.060 --> 05:30.300
Nifty lid!

05:30.340 --> 05:32.060
All right, this is for Mikey.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.220
All righty.

05:35.260 --> 05:36.460
Hey, it's a lampshade.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.340
Let's see. What else
do we have here?

05:40.380 --> 05:42.900
And for Leonardo,
there you go.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.500
- And Donatello...
- Japanese swords!

05:46.540 --> 05:48.140
This'll keep you
busy while I'm gone.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.140
Thanks.

05:49.180 --> 05:52.180
All right, and for Splinter...

05:52.220 --> 05:53.740
where is he anyway?

05:53.780 --> 05:55.700
He's doing rat stuff.

05:55.780 --> 05:57.100
Found this...

05:57.140 --> 06:00.140
actually, I don't
really know what it is.

06:00.180 --> 06:03.060
Some kind of a weird
antique or something.

06:04.060 --> 06:05.780
I think it's Japanese.

06:05.820 --> 06:08.060
Elvis Presley in "Blue Hawaii."

06:08.100 --> 06:10.020
You're so cute.

06:10.060 --> 06:13.660
A super androdyne
radio with triode tubes!

06:13.700 --> 06:14.620
Boss!

06:14.660 --> 06:16.940
Hey, what's that, April?

06:16.980 --> 06:21.820
Some kind of weird
Japanese antique...

06:21.860 --> 06:23.860
egg timer.

07:14.940 --> 07:19.340
Kenshin, I forbid you
to leave the castle.

07:19.380 --> 07:21.420
You have disgraced me.

07:21.460 --> 07:24.020
It is you who have
disgraced me, Father...

07:24.060 --> 07:26.740
with your unjust war.

07:39.780 --> 07:42.100
Walker.

07:47.260 --> 07:50.300
Walker, you're alive.

07:50.340 --> 07:53.180
Yes, I'd say that
was a fair assumption.

07:53.220 --> 07:56.300
Survived a shipwreck, built
some new ones, and, well...

07:56.340 --> 07:59.180
here I am, hungry again.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.220
Niles!

08:00.260 --> 08:02.300
Move along, lads.

08:04.580 --> 08:07.420
Your sentries, I believe.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.820
Must be a great comfort
to know...

08:08.860 --> 08:11.740
how well-protected
you are, Lord Norinaga.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.860
Kenshin, inside!

08:15.900 --> 08:17.180
Now!

08:34.419 --> 08:36.820
Children are such
a pest, aren't they?

08:36.900 --> 08:39.340
Especially when they
side with the enemy.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.659
Oh, dear. Damn nuisance.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.220
I just keep birds now.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.620
Little finches.

08:44.660 --> 08:47.420
Shut up, Niles.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.220
Right. I have three ships
sitting in your harbor...

08:49.260 --> 08:50.980
Ioaded down with powder
and muskets...

08:51.020 --> 08:54.060
absolutely guaranteed
to win your ambitious war.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.740
Kappa.

09:52.980 --> 09:55.980
"Open wide the gates of time."

10:08.180 --> 10:10.700
Uh... guys?

10:10.740 --> 10:12.620
Guys!

10:15.780 --> 10:18.620
What's going on?

10:18.660 --> 10:20.220
Wait a second here.

10:24.060 --> 10:25.940
Lay low!

10:25.980 --> 10:27.980
Cover your face!

10:28.020 --> 10:30.660
Feels like tornado weather!

10:34.100 --> 10:35.740
No way!

10:39.220 --> 10:40.700
She's a man!

11:05.460 --> 11:06.620
Kappa!

11:12.220 --> 11:16.380
You have that effect on people,
don't you, master?

11:16.420 --> 11:18.540
Out cold.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.780
Wakey, wakey. Wake up.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.620
Hey, guys, these clothes
look familiar to you?

11:54.660 --> 11:56.100
Wake up. Wake up...

11:56.140 --> 12:00.100
weird-looking
James Dean dude.

12:00.140 --> 12:02.340
I think he's coming around.

12:03.340 --> 12:04.340
Kappa!

12:04.380 --> 12:06.260
Cappa? Cappuccino?

12:06.300 --> 12:07.700
Nah, it makes me hyper.

12:07.740 --> 12:08.820
What's a kappa?

12:08.860 --> 12:11.900
Ancient Japanese demon.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.540
Some were good,
and some were very bad.

12:19.340 --> 12:20.500
Demons.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.860
Hey, he speaks English!

12:22.860 --> 12:24.380
Where's he from anyways?

12:24.420 --> 12:28.780
Well, judging from sword,
I'd say feudal Japan.

12:28.820 --> 12:32.140
That explains why
he speaks our language.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.700
See, England started
trading with Japan...

12:33.740 --> 12:35.180
All right, already.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.580
How'd you get in April's pants?

12:37.620 --> 12:39.580
I want to know what
happened to April.

12:39.660 --> 12:44.740
It seems the scepter
has magic powers...

12:44.780 --> 12:48.460
and somehow transported
them both through time.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.860
Hold on, dudes.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.340
If April's back in feudal Japan,
does that mean we, like...

12:53.380 --> 12:56.140
have to ride that scepter
back through time to get her?

12:56.180 --> 12:59.260
You have no choice, my son.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.540
Awesome! But do you think
they had pizza back then?

13:02.580 --> 13:05.140
Get out of town.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.500
What's going on, Captain?

13:17.540 --> 13:20.060
Ignorant, superstitious fools.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.900
We was just wondering!

13:21.940 --> 13:24.340
Them, you moronic toad!

13:24.380 --> 13:26.420
They seem to think the woman's
some kind of witch.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.300
She's some sort of a witch!

13:28.340 --> 13:29.620
Shut up.

13:58.780 --> 14:00.220
Some sort of a witch!

14:00.260 --> 14:01.780
Would you keep quiet!

14:08.660 --> 14:10.300
Sorry?

14:11.380 --> 14:13.980
Look, I took Spanish
in high school.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.980
Hey, easy.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.620
Next time, ask me
to turn it off.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.900
Where is my son, witch?

14:57.940 --> 15:01.180
Hey, I really don't have
a clue, OK...

15:01.220 --> 15:04.180
so why don't you just
drop this macho stuff?

15:05.740 --> 15:08.860
Lord Norinaga, allow me.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.980
The Daimyo and his court
believe that you're a witch...

15:25.020 --> 15:27.260
who has somehow managed
to spirit away his son.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.060
Is this true?

15:31.460 --> 15:34.140
Yeah, it's true.

15:34.180 --> 15:36.500
I am a witch.

15:36.540 --> 15:39.060
See that?

15:39.100 --> 15:42.740
I shrunk four
incredibly cool guys...

15:42.740 --> 15:44.660
and I locked them in there.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.780
Really?

15:50.020 --> 15:54.380
Then go ahead, witch, shrink me.

15:56.180 --> 16:00.820
Don't push me, Ruffles...

16:00.860 --> 16:05.300
or I'll melt you into
a steaming puddle of puke.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.820
She has no power.

16:13.860 --> 16:15.820
Let me question her
about your son.

16:15.860 --> 16:17.300
Then you can roast her,
toast her...

16:17.340 --> 16:19.220
chop her into
tiny little pieces...

16:19.260 --> 16:20.860
and feed her to the birds.

16:20.900 --> 16:24.700
No. I want her to suffer.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.300
Let's see here.

16:34.340 --> 16:38.500
If I subtract the cosine
from the inverted integer...

16:38.540 --> 16:42.580
then I can take the flangeler
and put that here.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.380
That's it!

16:44.420 --> 16:45.460
Of course!

16:48.260 --> 16:50.580
It's equal mass displacement!

16:50.620 --> 16:54.500
See, guys, for every one of us
that goes back...

16:54.540 --> 16:57.300
someone from the past
will come here.

16:57.340 --> 16:59.340
But the problem is...

16:59.380 --> 17:02.180
that switch will only work
under one condition.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.660
You know what that is?

17:03.700 --> 17:05.339
Tuesdays?

17:05.380 --> 17:07.180
Groundhog's Day?

17:07.220 --> 17:09.460
Great.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.500
It will only work
if the magic travelers...

17:12.500 --> 17:14.780
each have the same weight.

17:17.140 --> 17:22.339
Bingo. Gee, you guys do have
a good educational system, huh?

17:22.339 --> 17:24.260
Step back, dudes.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.180
I just brought us
some heavy artillery.

17:30.220 --> 17:31.220
Donny!

17:31.260 --> 17:32.780
Long time!

17:32.820 --> 17:34.460
Leo, how's it going?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.820
Hey, Casey, welcome back.

17:36.860 --> 17:38.660
Hey, Raph, how'd your
brain implant go, good?

17:38.700 --> 17:41.780
What? Funny.

17:41.820 --> 17:45.700
Anyway, enough of this
camaraderie.

17:45.740 --> 17:48.500
When do we get together
and bust some skulls?

17:48.540 --> 17:50.300
Hold it there, Casey.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.740
You're not gonna do
any head-breaking this time.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.780
Sorry, guy.

17:53.820 --> 17:54.900
What was that?

17:54.940 --> 17:56.420
You want to run that
by me again?

17:56.460 --> 17:57.580
How come?

17:57.620 --> 17:59.820
'Cause we need somebody
to stay here with Splinter...

17:59.860 --> 18:02.260
in case the time bandit
here decides to flip out.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.900
If it ain't too much
of an inconvenience.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.660
It'll be a serious honor.

18:09.660 --> 18:12.460
It is time to go, my sons.

18:12.500 --> 18:16.100
Donatello, we shall wait
by the scepter...

18:16.140 --> 18:19.860
every twelve hours
as you have instructed.

18:19.900 --> 18:23.660
Correct, Master Splinter,
but the space-time continuum...

18:23.700 --> 18:26.020
will be out of phase
after sixty hours.

18:26.020 --> 18:27.500
Wait a second.
Time-out.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.860
What does all that mean
in American?

18:29.860 --> 18:31.900
If we don't come back
in 2 1/2 days...

18:31.940 --> 18:33.020
we're turtle soup.

18:34.140 --> 18:36.700
Bummer.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.940
Why don't you get
a real job, cue ball?

18:52.620 --> 18:55.460
Hey, hey. You know what?
This is a Rolex.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.020
It's a gold Rolex.
You want it?

18:57.100 --> 18:58.700
Let me out of here!

19:09.580 --> 19:12.140
If you stay with Walker,
you die.

19:12.180 --> 19:14.460
You come with me, you live.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.140
Lock him up, lads.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.740
You! Up, fool, up.

19:27.620 --> 19:33.180
Well, well, well.
What have we got here?

19:33.220 --> 19:37.660
Give us a kiss, duckling,
while you still got your lips.

19:39.900 --> 19:44.460
You're not the first one
to do that to me.

19:45.860 --> 19:47.980
There you are, Mr. Whit.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.900
You can lead your stinking
mutiny in here!

19:52.460 --> 19:55.140
Good night, me little
tweety birds.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.420
Come on, lads.

20:01.820 --> 20:02.860
Goodbye, Whit!

20:10.580 --> 20:11.860
Casey?

20:26.820 --> 20:28.940
Yeah, you look familiar, too.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.420
The scepter will be
in the temple...

20:33.460 --> 20:37.020
which means you will be
replaced by four priests.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.380
Nothing to it.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.860
Now we must please try to hurry.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.180
Mitsu is in great danger.

20:43.220 --> 20:44.140
Mits-who?

20:44.180 --> 20:47.420
Yes, Mitsu. She is
the woman who leads...

20:47.460 --> 20:48.780
the rebellion against my father.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.820
She is the most courageous
and beautiful woman...

20:52.860 --> 20:56.660
Yeah, we get the picture.
Can we go now?

20:56.700 --> 20:57.860
Enough Mitsu already.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.820
T-minus two minutes
and counting.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.100
Let's go, Mikey.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.020
What?

21:08.660 --> 21:10.460
Why are you wearing shorts?

21:10.500 --> 21:13.260
Kenshin switched with April
and got her clothes.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.420
Yeah, so?

21:14.460 --> 21:17.300
So this is for whoever
comes through in my place...

21:17.340 --> 21:19.500
so they won't arrive
bare-butt naked.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.460
I got three more pairs.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.060
No!

21:24.100 --> 21:28.340
We have no time for this
scientific debate.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.020
Yes, master.
Come on, guys, let's go.

21:31.060 --> 21:32.460
It's time.

21:34.740 --> 21:36.060
Kids.

21:37.820 --> 21:40.380
The inscription says,
"Open wide the gates of time."

21:40.380 --> 21:42.260
All right already.
Let's go!

21:42.260 --> 21:46.380
Go with care, my sons,
and return with swiftness.

21:46.420 --> 21:48.820
We will not fail you,
Master Splinter.

21:48.820 --> 21:51.100
OK, guys.
Hold on now.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.100
Here we go.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.100
It's starting to work.
Hang on!

22:04.220 --> 22:06.420
Make sure your tray tables...

22:06.460 --> 22:08.460
are in their full
upright positions!

22:08.500 --> 22:12.420
Hang on to your shells, dudes!

22:26.580 --> 22:28.220
This is very bad.

22:28.260 --> 22:29.660
They are not four priests.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.860
They are my father's
honor guard.

22:31.900 --> 22:34.420
The scepter was
not in the temple.

22:34.460 --> 22:36.340
There must have been a battle.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.140
I knew it.
I'm missing all the fun.

22:51.780 --> 22:54.460
Where are the priests?

22:54.500 --> 22:55.900
Where's the temple?

22:55.940 --> 22:58.140
Talk about your quantum leap.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.940
Hey, dudes, check it out!

23:02.980 --> 23:04.260
We're in "Shogun"!

23:07.940 --> 23:10.580
Hey, where'd we get
these clothes?

23:10.620 --> 23:13.820
These guys are pretty serious.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.380
How do you steer this thing?

23:21.420 --> 23:22.580
There's no steering
wheel on mine.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.660
You're lucky! Mine doesn't
even have a head!

23:24.700 --> 23:27.580
Watch out for the people!

23:36.380 --> 23:38.860
Don't these things
ever run out of gas?

23:38.900 --> 23:40.780
I think I swallowed a frog.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.300
Hope it wasn't an ancestor.

23:42.340 --> 23:44.060
That was fun.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.380
Well, at least
the time travel worked.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.780
We're here five minutes,
and already we lost...

23:48.820 --> 23:50.700
one brother,
the magic scepter...

23:50.740 --> 23:51.700
Our dignity...

23:51.740 --> 23:53.740
And no April.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.740
Hey, where's Mikey?

23:55.780 --> 23:58.300
Last time I saw him,
he was doing this...

23:59.620 --> 24:01.820
Jeez, what else could happen?

24:01.860 --> 24:04.580
Whoa, Buttermilk!

24:04.620 --> 24:06.460
Good horsey! Good horsey!

24:07.540 --> 24:09.340
Who turned out the lights?

24:09.380 --> 24:13.300
I think I saw this
on "Bonanza" once.

25:07.420 --> 25:10.860
OK, boys, who's first in line?

25:10.900 --> 25:12.380
Come on.

25:17.220 --> 25:20.500
Ancient wusses.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.260
Even here, you find me.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.260
Put down your sword, Kenshin.

25:31.300 --> 25:35.100
They are not enemies,
only lost warriors...

25:35.180 --> 25:36.220
like yourself.

25:45.060 --> 25:47.300
So far this disguise
has worked...

25:47.340 --> 25:49.620
but we're turtles,
not honor guards.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.540
Thanks for pointing
that out, Leo.

25:51.580 --> 25:54.100
That would explain
the large shell on my back.

25:54.140 --> 25:56.060
Well, you don't have
to be so sarcastic.

25:56.060 --> 25:58.420
Well, I'm sorry, Leo,
but that's my nature.

26:03.580 --> 26:06.940
You see, Walker,
we do not need your help.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.660
We're victorious
without your guns.

26:09.700 --> 26:13.900
Today my honor guard carried
my own secret weapon.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.300
Really? Well,
that's very good news.

26:16.340 --> 26:18.540
Where are my honor guards?

26:18.580 --> 26:21.460
Murata, find my honor guards.

26:21.500 --> 26:22.420
Yes!

26:22.460 --> 26:23.940
Now! Right away!

26:29.180 --> 26:30.100
You!

26:31.140 --> 26:33.500
Come here. Now!

26:33.540 --> 26:36.380
I told you these outfits
would get us into trouble.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.340
Let's go.
Blend in.

26:37.380 --> 26:38.300
Yeah, right.

26:38.340 --> 26:40.100
They're coming.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.500
They're behind the wagon.

26:41.540 --> 26:42.900
Step aside!

26:46.380 --> 26:48.340
Where are they?

26:50.380 --> 26:51.980
Go! Idiot!

26:55.060 --> 26:58.140
It's very impressive, my lord.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.740
This is very bad.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.700
Well, they fell for it.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.900
Shh! Keep it down, Leo.

27:06.940 --> 27:08.380
So they've gone missing.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.580
I mean, war does have a habit
of doing that to people.

27:10.620 --> 27:12.260
It's time to look to the future.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.500
You do not understand.
My honor guard carried...

27:14.540 --> 27:16.420
a sacred family relic
to ensure victory.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.460
Ah, yes, the golden scepter.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.180
Well, one does hear things.

27:20.220 --> 27:25.140
Secrets leak like
a stink from a dead pig.

27:25.180 --> 27:28.020
You certainly can
turn a phrase, my lord.

27:28.060 --> 27:30.700
Listen to me, Daimyo.
Guns ensure victory...

27:30.740 --> 27:32.580
not some ancestral
good-luck charm.

27:32.620 --> 27:33.580
You are wrong.

27:33.620 --> 27:35.260
If the scepter's lost,
my clan is lost...

27:35.300 --> 27:36.260
and you, Walker,
will have no one...

27:36.300 --> 27:40.420
to trade with but yourself.

27:40.460 --> 27:41.940
Niles!

27:46.020 --> 27:46.940
Captain?

27:46.940 --> 27:49.380
Bring me the woman.

27:52.340 --> 27:54.420
Come on, guys.
Let's find the temple.

27:54.460 --> 27:55.860
Maybe April's still in there.

27:55.860 --> 27:59.300
Boy, Kenshin's dad
must be seriously rich.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.620
I think I saw this place...

28:00.660 --> 28:02.580
on "Lifestyles of the
Rich and Dangerous."

28:02.580 --> 28:04.860
"Bring me the woman, Niles."

28:04.900 --> 28:06.900
"Lick my boots, Niles."

28:06.940 --> 28:08.420
"Feed my birds, Niles."

28:08.460 --> 28:10.980
What's next,
roll over and play dead?

28:11.020 --> 28:14.140
What are you looking at,
you ugly lump of dung?

28:14.180 --> 28:15.100
What?

28:19.020 --> 28:20.380
Dung, huh?

28:25.380 --> 28:28.700
You dirty... I oughta...

28:30.580 --> 28:31.540
Later, Popeye.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.420
I'm going to get that guy!

28:33.460 --> 28:35.260
You hear what he called me, Leo?

28:35.260 --> 28:36.980
Yeah, an ugly lump of dung.

28:37.020 --> 28:40.020
Well, that was an insult, Leo.

28:40.060 --> 28:41.580
Not necessarily, Raph.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.900
Did you know that
in some countries...

28:42.900 --> 28:44.820
dung is used as a fuel source?

28:47.300 --> 28:48.700
Thanks, Don.

28:48.700 --> 28:50.100
Hi-o, wasabi.

28:50.140 --> 28:51.980
Hello, mustard?

28:52.020 --> 28:54.820
OK, so my Japanese
is a little rusty.

28:54.860 --> 28:57.380
Suzuki, Kawasaki.

28:57.420 --> 28:59.860
How about sayonara?

28:59.900 --> 29:01.740
- That'll work.
- Ciao.

29:01.780 --> 29:03.500
- Adios.
- See you later.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.780
It's me again, Fatso-san.

29:11.860 --> 29:13.460
Open up.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.700
Hurry up!

29:19.620 --> 29:20.620
Woman!

29:20.660 --> 29:25.100
We want woman.

29:26.620 --> 29:28.220
Move it, you sot!

29:28.260 --> 29:31.140
He's not man enough
to do anything.

29:33.260 --> 29:34.860
There they are...

29:34.900 --> 29:36.500
the Three Stooges.

29:36.540 --> 29:39.020
Larry, Curly, and Moe.

29:40.020 --> 29:42.020
Get her down, you fat sot!

29:42.060 --> 29:43.940
Beat it.
See you later.

29:43.980 --> 29:46.460
Don't ruffle
me little duck's feathers.

29:46.460 --> 29:48.100
I want her for myself.

29:50.300 --> 29:51.580
Hurry up!

29:55.300 --> 29:57.780
It's wet willy time, Moe.

29:57.820 --> 30:00.820
Wet... what-um?

30:05.180 --> 30:06.620
What a maroon!

30:06.660 --> 30:07.900
Hey, what's up, April?

30:07.940 --> 30:08.860
Oh, hi, April.

30:08.900 --> 30:09.820
Yo, April.

30:09.860 --> 30:12.020
Raph? Leo?

30:12.060 --> 30:15.500
Boy, some vacation!
I'd fire my travel agent.

30:15.540 --> 30:16.500
Not me.
I think it's cool.

30:16.500 --> 30:17.500
Hey, fat boy.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.340
Yeah, get him in there.

30:27.380 --> 30:30.060
Hey, don't forget
to pack a lunch.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.060
As a matter of fact, pack three.

30:32.100 --> 30:34.380
Wow, he can actually
lift that thing.

30:34.420 --> 30:35.500
That's impressive.

30:35.540 --> 30:36.460
Hey, hello?

30:36.500 --> 30:37.900
Nice clothes, April.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.940
What? Would somebody
please tell me...

30:39.980 --> 30:41.820
what the heck is
going on around here?

30:41.860 --> 30:43.580
Well, relax, April.

30:43.620 --> 30:45.020
It's just your ordinary...

30:45.060 --> 30:47.700
time-travel-equal-mass-
displacement kind of thing.

30:47.740 --> 30:48.660
Yeah, what he said.

30:49.700 --> 30:52.380
So let's get out of here... now!

30:54.140 --> 30:56.220
Be nice, brave miss!

30:56.260 --> 30:59.180
Miss, cut me loose.
They'll hang me here.

31:00.340 --> 31:03.420
This is my favorite part!

31:03.460 --> 31:04.420
Come on!

31:07.660 --> 31:09.380
Next.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.940
I know I'm going to regret this.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.500
Hey, come and get me. Come on!

31:21.540 --> 31:22.900
Watch your head.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.940
Well, come on! Hurry!

31:37.820 --> 31:39.220
Hey, think these guys...

31:39.260 --> 31:41.900
have ever seen
a pinball machine before?

31:41.940 --> 31:43.820
Watch. Throw them to me.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.020
Boing! Tilt!

31:48.060 --> 31:49.940
Fight's over.
We're closed.

31:49.980 --> 31:52.540
These guys are really pushy.

31:52.580 --> 31:54.100
They don't know when to quit.

31:54.140 --> 31:55.500
What are you doing, April?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.460
Come on! I think
I found a way out.

31:58.660 --> 32:01.020
Obviously not
the age of chivalry.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.220
Come on!

32:02.260 --> 32:04.020
Go! We're right behind you!

32:09.140 --> 32:10.420
Not another sewer!

32:13.340 --> 32:14.300
I'll be back.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.740
Garbage!

32:30.420 --> 32:32.940
Boy, do I hate spinach.

32:35.820 --> 32:36.740
Raph?

32:40.460 --> 32:42.460
Well...

32:42.500 --> 32:45.420
I'm in there. Donny?

32:55.020 --> 32:59.780
Mud wrestling is definitely
a spectator sport.

33:00.780 --> 33:02.900
Gross.

33:02.940 --> 33:03.860
Grosser.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.500
April!

33:06.500 --> 33:07.420
Here.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.180
Help me up.

33:12.180 --> 33:13.580
All right. I'm coming.
On my way over.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.500
A little mud, no problem.

33:15.540 --> 33:16.460
Help me.

33:19.380 --> 33:21.900
Wait, wait.
I'm getting...

33:21.940 --> 33:25.580
This was the worst rescue
I have ever had.

33:25.620 --> 33:28.020
Help! I'm a turtle,
and I can't get up!

33:29.860 --> 33:31.180
Thanks.

33:31.220 --> 33:32.380
We'd better get out of here.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.380
Look on the bright side, April.

33:34.420 --> 33:37.180
We could've fallen into a big,
greasy, smelly pile of...

33:37.220 --> 33:39.140
Don't even say it, Don!

33:45.980 --> 33:47.260
Hello?

34:05.940 --> 34:07.060
Oh, hello.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.179
Oh, that hurts.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.739
What a head popper!

34:15.780 --> 34:18.780
Boy! Earth to me.

34:24.219 --> 34:27.260
God, my neck hurts.
My spots hurt.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.820
Even my bandanna hurts.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.460
Hey, little one.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.980
Hey, where am I?

34:38.020 --> 34:40.620
Mikey!

34:42.580 --> 34:45.500
Yo, Michaelangelo!

34:45.540 --> 34:48.219
Hey, Mikey!

34:54.100 --> 34:55.340
Much better.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.860
- A leg-o-rama.
- Yeah, I'll say.

34:58.900 --> 35:02.580
Hey! I'm allowed.
I'm on vacation.

35:02.620 --> 35:04.540
Right.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.940
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.620
- Schwing!
- Schwing!

35:19.940 --> 35:22.780
Hey, Leo.
Look at this water.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.260
I don't see anything.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.100
Exactly!

35:27.140 --> 35:32.220
No tires, no beer cans,
no dead fish...

35:32.260 --> 35:34.460
just water...

35:34.500 --> 35:37.860
clean, clear,
beautiful water.

35:41.580 --> 35:45.260
Nature! I love it!
Makes me want to...

35:45.300 --> 35:47.620
I don't know,
migrate or something.

35:49.620 --> 35:53.020
Turtles don't migrate, Raph.
Birds do.

35:53.060 --> 35:56.180
Hey, I got a beak, don't I?

35:57.260 --> 36:00.340
- OK, turtles, let's move out.
- You bet.

36:04.380 --> 36:05.580
Ambush!

36:05.620 --> 36:08.340
Here comes trouble, guys.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.020
One... and a two!

36:30.180 --> 36:32.580
Enjoy your swim, fellas.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.540
Miss me?

36:50.900 --> 36:53.220
You like baseball here?

36:53.260 --> 36:55.340
Strike one!
Strike two!

36:55.380 --> 36:56.740
You're out of there.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.180
I love that game.

36:58.220 --> 37:00.660
OK. I've had enough.

37:04.100 --> 37:06.260
Come on, Jack!

37:06.300 --> 37:08.860
It's hammer time.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.300
Missed!

37:20.180 --> 37:22.540
Here, hold these.
Thank you.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.660
Dance?

37:37.020 --> 37:38.900
What?

37:44.580 --> 37:47.500
No, no, no, lady.
That ain't nice.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.740
Hey, who blew the whistle?

37:57.780 --> 37:59.900
Hey, look!

38:03.100 --> 38:05.100
Hey, we're friends.

38:05.140 --> 38:07.980
We're here to find
our brother, that's all.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.620
Hey, I don't kiss
on the first date, lady.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.580
Raph, give it a rest, will you?

38:15.900 --> 38:17.540
Don't be afraid.

38:21.020 --> 38:23.740
You are just like
the other one.

38:23.740 --> 38:24.700
Say what?

38:24.740 --> 38:25.660
The other one?

38:25.700 --> 38:26.700
Mikey?

38:26.740 --> 38:28.660
- What?
- Bingo!

38:30.700 --> 38:31.620
Most excellent!

38:33.540 --> 38:35.100
Get down with
your turtle self.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.100
They say your friends
are devils or demons.

39:00.140 --> 39:02.700
Hey, pal, you got
a relative in Brooklyn?

39:03.700 --> 39:06.020
I figure they're mercenaries
in disguise...

39:06.060 --> 39:08.540
come to help the rebels.

39:08.580 --> 39:09.980
Invaders from the north.

39:15.060 --> 39:16.740
My village!

39:21.100 --> 39:23.420
Mikey!

39:31.860 --> 39:33.020
Find Kenshin!

39:33.060 --> 39:36.060
Fire over their heads and burn
this place to the ground!

39:36.100 --> 39:38.380
There's a reward for the man
who brings me the scepter!

39:38.420 --> 39:40.020
Go!

39:41.940 --> 39:42.900
Burn it!

39:48.700 --> 39:49.820
Go!

39:52.860 --> 39:54.660
Yoshi!

39:57.500 --> 39:59.340
Gunfire?

39:59.380 --> 40:01.420
Better cover the melon.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.820
I got to get out of here!

40:11.740 --> 40:13.820
Burn it to the ground!

40:17.700 --> 40:19.940
It's one of them honor guards.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.380
There's a reward for him.

40:27.420 --> 40:29.820
Greetings from Her Majesty.

40:33.300 --> 40:36.220
My heroes!

40:38.100 --> 40:40.060
Wait!

40:40.100 --> 40:42.660
I'm really a beautiful princess
in disguise.

40:42.700 --> 40:43.900
Oh, swords.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.660
Break the spell!

40:47.700 --> 40:50.260
Give me a kiss!

40:51.420 --> 40:52.340
A monster!

40:52.340 --> 40:53.300
What?

40:53.300 --> 40:54.220
Bright green!

40:54.260 --> 40:56.460
What do you mean, a monster?

40:56.500 --> 40:58.620
Which way did they go?

41:00.060 --> 41:01.460
Excuse me, Niles.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.700
Shouldn't you be trying
to scare somebody?

41:03.740 --> 41:05.460
But there's a demon
up the road, Captain...

41:05.460 --> 41:07.660
a wild beast
with the body of a man...

41:07.700 --> 41:09.260
and the head
of the devil himself.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.420
Listen to me,
you cretinous idiot...

41:11.460 --> 41:12.900
it's nothing but a Samurai...

41:12.940 --> 41:14.300
wearing one of his
ridiculous masks.

41:14.340 --> 41:16.100
- But...
- Shut up!

41:16.140 --> 41:17.620
Get on with it!

41:21.780 --> 41:24.540
What the...

41:26.900 --> 41:29.420
Clint Eastwood?

41:46.820 --> 41:48.380
Hey, Butch.

41:48.420 --> 41:50.340
Don't you know
westerns are dead?

41:50.380 --> 41:52.380
Speaking of dead...

41:59.780 --> 42:01.260
I'll save you, Captain.

42:01.300 --> 42:04.260
Hi there.

42:04.300 --> 42:05.540
You see, when I said
westerns were dead...

42:05.580 --> 42:07.020
what I meant was, uh...
well, they're not dead.

42:07.060 --> 42:08.380
'cause I forgot about Clint.

42:08.420 --> 42:11.020
You look a lot like Clint,
yes, you do.

42:12.580 --> 42:13.500
Wet willy.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.740
Sorry, Captain!

42:20.540 --> 42:23.980
Dudes!
Most excellent timing!

42:32.620 --> 42:33.940
Split up!

42:42.860 --> 42:45.580
Hold it right there, Zorro dude!

42:56.780 --> 42:58.060
He's getting away!

43:04.900 --> 43:05.820
Wimp!

43:05.860 --> 43:07.580
Captain, don't leave me here!

43:09.140 --> 43:10.620
Wait for...

43:12.700 --> 43:16.500
Help! Grandfather, help!

43:16.500 --> 43:20.620
- Yoshi!
- Help!

43:20.660 --> 43:22.180
- Grandfather, help!
- Easy, easy.

43:22.220 --> 43:23.220
Yoshi!

43:23.260 --> 43:24.420
Grandson!

43:26.180 --> 43:27.620
Stay right here.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.060
I don't think I'm cut out
for this hero stuff.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.420
Michaelangelo!

43:44.460 --> 43:46.860
Drink some water.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.420
What's going on?

43:49.740 --> 43:52.660
Well, here I go!

43:52.700 --> 43:54.220
I don't believe it!
He went in!

43:54.300 --> 43:55.980
Mikey, no!

44:05.660 --> 44:07.700
We've got to do something!

44:15.140 --> 44:17.660
Kurt Russell,
eat your heart out.

44:20.100 --> 44:22.220
I think he's going to be OK.

44:32.700 --> 44:34.140
Are you all right?

44:35.140 --> 44:36.180
You scared me half to death.

44:36.180 --> 44:38.460
Scared me half to death.

44:43.660 --> 44:46.220
I can't believe you did that!
You're a hero!

44:46.260 --> 44:47.900
He has no life in him!

44:49.540 --> 44:50.980
What's going on?

44:52.060 --> 44:53.980
Give him to me.

44:53.980 --> 44:56.020
Let me take him, please.

44:57.860 --> 44:59.620
Keep everyone back.

44:59.660 --> 45:00.700
Stay back, everyone.

45:00.740 --> 45:01.780
Give the guy some room.

45:01.820 --> 45:03.180
- Give me some room.
- Give him some room!

45:03.220 --> 45:04.780
Everybody get back.

45:17.100 --> 45:19.540
No, wait.
Let him try.

45:19.580 --> 45:22.180
No! He's casting an evil spell.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.620
No, it's not an evil spell.
He's helping.

45:24.660 --> 45:27.860
Keep back, everyone.
I need more time.

45:31.380 --> 45:32.820
Help him out.

45:33.940 --> 45:36.300
Come on, Leo. You can do it.

45:50.060 --> 45:54.900
One, two, three, four, five.

45:54.940 --> 45:57.100
One, two, three...

46:00.180 --> 46:02.140
That a boy, Leo.

46:02.180 --> 46:04.380
- He did it!
- All right!

46:14.020 --> 46:16.220
You're going to be OK, Yoshi.

46:20.140 --> 46:22.140
Here you go.

46:28.660 --> 46:31.860
- Outstanding, dude!
- Thanks.

46:33.420 --> 46:36.940
I just hope these village people
won't be afraid of us anymore.

46:49.900 --> 46:52.380
Well, it's a start.

46:55.780 --> 46:59.060
Your men showed
lack of courage today.

46:59.100 --> 47:03.220
They were frightened
by the demons, as were your men.

47:03.220 --> 47:04.980
Is that so?

47:06.100 --> 47:08.460
Walker...

47:08.500 --> 47:09.940
Look.

47:12.060 --> 47:14.420
Tell me...

47:14.420 --> 47:16.660
were the demons today not men?

47:16.700 --> 47:19.380
Real demons?

47:19.420 --> 47:20.980
I don't know.

47:21.020 --> 47:29.180
Old priests say once before,
demons defeated my ancestors.

47:31.940 --> 47:34.020
Now they've come back for me.

47:37.340 --> 47:40.780
I agree to your price.

47:40.820 --> 47:43.500
Guns for silver and silk.

47:44.500 --> 47:46.420
Guns for gold.

47:46.420 --> 47:49.100
Now there are demons.
Before there were just men.

47:50.140 --> 47:54.580
My cannons can destroy
these monsters, my lord.

47:54.620 --> 47:56.620
You can rewrite history.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.980
And I can rewrite you.

48:14.900 --> 48:16.100
Clothesline!

48:19.100 --> 48:21.340
Wipeout!

48:21.380 --> 48:22.900
Hi-yo, Silver!

48:24.580 --> 48:25.660
Oh, horse.

48:28.700 --> 48:29.740
Hey, horsey!

48:30.820 --> 48:33.620
Somebody dial 911.
Medic!

48:34.700 --> 48:35.940
You thirsty?

48:37.220 --> 48:38.340
My butt.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.620
You didn't find
the scepter, did you?

48:41.660 --> 48:43.540
Nah. It's history.

48:47.660 --> 48:49.140
Adios, amigos.

48:49.180 --> 48:52.300
You know, sometimes
I hate that guy.

48:54.740 --> 48:55.700
Let's see...

48:55.740 --> 48:59.020
Wait. Let's just
hold it here, OK?

48:59.060 --> 49:00.540
If the scepter
wasn't in the woods...

49:00.580 --> 49:02.380
maybe the Daimyo has it.

49:02.420 --> 49:04.500
No. He's been
looking for it, too.

49:04.540 --> 49:06.260
So what are we going to do?

49:06.300 --> 49:08.460
How are we going to get home?

49:08.500 --> 49:09.900
Wait!
Fellas, listen.

49:09.940 --> 49:12.700
Are you sure this isn't
a dumb thing to do?

49:12.740 --> 49:14.420
No, it's a smart thing to do.

49:14.460 --> 49:17.020
Losing the old scepter
was a dumb thing to do.

49:17.060 --> 49:18.460
I didn't lose it, OK?

49:27.300 --> 49:28.940
Excuse me.

49:31.940 --> 49:34.020
What?

49:34.060 --> 49:36.580
I don't mean to spoil
your little party here.

49:40.740 --> 49:42.340
This is your plan?

49:43.860 --> 49:45.500
You don't mean... you're
not seriously suggesting...

49:45.540 --> 49:46.900
that Donatello is
going to make...

49:46.940 --> 49:49.300
an incredibly arcane time
travel machine, are you?

49:51.780 --> 49:52.700
Totally bogus.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.180
Really stupid.

49:54.220 --> 49:55.620
Well, that's a relief.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.580
No, that guy's going to make it.

49:58.820 --> 50:01.060
He's good with his hands.

50:03.780 --> 50:04.740
What?

50:05.700 --> 50:07.980
Come on, April.

50:08.020 --> 50:09.420
Where are you going?

50:09.460 --> 50:11.260
To find an apartment.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.300
I have a feeling...

50:13.340 --> 50:15.860
we're going to be here
for a very long time.

50:15.900 --> 50:16.900
An apartment?

50:16.940 --> 50:18.220
Are there apartments in Japan?

50:18.260 --> 50:19.420
What do I look like,
a real estate agent?

50:19.460 --> 50:21.540
What about condos
and time-shares?

50:35.780 --> 50:38.140
Take me with you.

50:38.180 --> 50:40.020
Where? New York?

50:40.060 --> 50:42.460
No. You wouldn't fit in.

50:42.500 --> 50:46.220
I mean... well, actually,
you would fit in.

50:46.260 --> 50:48.380
But you wouldn't
really fit in...

50:48.420 --> 50:49.620
you know what I mean?

50:49.660 --> 50:50.860
You could teach me.

50:50.900 --> 50:52.700
No, I couldn't.

50:53.940 --> 50:59.140
Look, Whit... l'm going back
real soon and...

51:00.180 --> 51:02.740
I don't want to have
this conversation, OK?

51:16.660 --> 51:19.060
Take whatever you guys
need, all right?

51:25.220 --> 51:26.220
Hey, Ken.

51:26.260 --> 51:28.220
Maybe you ought to try
a little decaf?

51:28.260 --> 51:30.180
Kenshin is unhappy.

51:30.260 --> 51:33.780
He believes they will
never get home.

51:33.820 --> 51:35.860
It ain't exactly
a quick jaunt...

51:35.900 --> 51:37.580
across the Brooklyn Bridge,
is it?

51:41.980 --> 51:43.740
Hey, Ken.

51:43.780 --> 51:45.220
You know, maybe you
ought to try...

51:45.260 --> 51:46.860
a little herbal, Ken-man,
know what I mean?

51:46.900 --> 51:51.380
We can't wait for your sons!
Mitsu needs me now.

51:54.500 --> 51:55.740
The scepter.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.180
Please!

52:13.580 --> 52:15.020
Can you believe it?

52:15.060 --> 52:18.660
We're not even
in the playoffs yet.

52:18.700 --> 52:19.820
The space-time continuum...

52:19.860 --> 52:23.780
will be out of phase
after sixty hours.

52:23.900 --> 52:26.100
Pick up the pace, Smithy-san.

52:26.140 --> 52:28.420
We gotta have that scepter
done by tonight.

52:29.900 --> 52:31.300
No.

52:33.140 --> 52:34.220
What?

52:36.380 --> 52:37.740
You know, there is one...

52:37.780 --> 52:40.860
O sole mio

52:40.900 --> 52:42.580
We're talking franchises
here, bud.

52:42.620 --> 52:44.700
All you got to do
is keep your delivery...

52:44.780 --> 52:46.780
to under thirty minutes.

52:46.820 --> 52:49.140
Let's see what we got here.

52:51.900 --> 52:52.860
Pizza.

52:52.860 --> 52:54.260
Got that, dude?

52:54.300 --> 52:56.020
Pizza.

53:01.500 --> 53:04.540
Frisbee. Also cool.

53:08.340 --> 53:10.420
Who frisbeed me in the face?

53:10.460 --> 53:11.500
I'm out of here.

53:11.580 --> 53:13.180
Why, I ought to...

53:14.940 --> 53:18.100
It was Mike with the thing
and the lady.

53:32.740 --> 53:34.140
Hey, chill.

53:34.140 --> 53:36.540
What is this,
the Geraldo Show?

53:36.580 --> 53:39.100
You got to learn to control
that temper, guy.

53:39.140 --> 53:41.260
Did I say that?

53:41.300 --> 53:44.140
We're practicing
fighting the Daimyo.

53:44.180 --> 53:45.380
Fight the Daimyo?

53:45.420 --> 53:46.700
Hold on here.

53:46.740 --> 53:48.140
Fighting's for grown-ups...

53:48.180 --> 53:50.900
and that's only if you
got no other choice.

53:50.940 --> 53:53.980
You guys are kids.
You should be out...

53:54.020 --> 53:57.420
you should be out having fun,
flying those things.

53:57.500 --> 54:00.060
Come on. We can do it together.

54:00.100 --> 54:01.540
You could teach me.

54:01.580 --> 54:02.940
Fun is for children.

54:02.980 --> 54:05.580
And what, you're
a senior citizen?

54:05.620 --> 54:06.900
Come on!

54:06.940 --> 54:08.140
It'll be easy.

54:08.180 --> 54:10.060
What did you say your name was?

54:10.060 --> 54:11.020
Yoshi.

54:14.380 --> 54:17.220
You and your buddies
grab those kites...

54:17.260 --> 54:19.660
and I'll join you later.

54:22.420 --> 54:25.020
Kids.

54:31.540 --> 54:33.180
Yoshi! Wait up!

54:37.780 --> 54:39.580
Hey! I think I'm getting this.

54:39.620 --> 54:40.940
Yoshi, what do you think?

54:40.980 --> 54:41.980
Look at that.

55:11.740 --> 55:14.780
Lord Norinaga
accepts your price.

55:14.820 --> 55:16.260
Guns for gold.

55:16.300 --> 55:19.100
Tell the Daimyo
to prepare the papers.

55:43.420 --> 55:44.900
Sorry.

55:44.900 --> 55:48.180
I guess you want
to be alone, huh?

55:48.220 --> 55:51.860
I was asking the gods
to protect someone.

55:51.900 --> 55:53.500
Kenshin?

55:55.380 --> 55:58.620
He's, like, your beau, huh?

55:58.660 --> 56:00.300
You know him?

56:00.340 --> 56:02.140
Sort of.

56:02.140 --> 56:06.700
He kinda went on a cosmic cruise
and dropped in on us.

56:06.740 --> 56:08.620
But don't worry.
He'll be back...

56:08.660 --> 56:11.220
as soon as we leave.
I promise.

56:11.260 --> 56:13.340
How do you know this?

56:13.380 --> 56:15.100
Well...

56:16.780 --> 56:18.900
it's a kappa kind of thing.

56:22.580 --> 56:26.260
So... what's your sign?

56:46.620 --> 56:47.860
Man!

56:49.620 --> 56:51.580
- Hockey.
- Hockey.

56:51.620 --> 56:54.500
I guess it's time for
a little cultural exchange...

56:54.540 --> 56:56.540
if you know what I mean.

56:58.940 --> 57:00.540
OK, guys.

57:00.580 --> 57:02.900
Let's play a little hockey.

57:02.940 --> 57:03.860
Hockey?

57:09.460 --> 57:11.020
Take your best shot.

57:11.060 --> 57:13.340
Come on.

57:13.380 --> 57:16.020
Just like you saw on TV.

57:16.060 --> 57:17.020
Remember?

57:20.860 --> 57:21.780
Hey. Good.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.180
All right.

57:46.500 --> 57:49.300
OK. I can work with that.

58:28.780 --> 58:30.540
Good.

58:30.580 --> 58:34.340
Tomorrow, Walker,
we will use your guns.

58:34.380 --> 58:37.020
My pleasure.

58:37.060 --> 58:38.460
Walker.

58:40.260 --> 58:44.580
My dungeon's very crowded.

58:45.820 --> 58:47.260
Well, then it would
only be humane...

58:47.340 --> 58:49.980
not to take any more
prisoners then, wouldn't it?

58:50.020 --> 58:52.980
You'll just have to kill
everybody.

58:55.020 --> 58:58.220
What do you hear, sensei?

58:58.260 --> 59:00.140
Danger.

59:01.220 --> 59:03.580
Mitsu.

59:06.860 --> 59:08.700
What is it?

59:08.740 --> 59:11.260
Mitsu, I bring bad news
from the castle.

59:11.860 --> 59:13.460
It's two hours to midnight.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.900
I sure hope this works.

59:15.940 --> 59:17.380
Yes.

59:17.420 --> 59:18.900
Why, this is perfect.

59:18.940 --> 59:20.860
What if this doesn't
work, dudes?

59:20.900 --> 59:23.100
What if we make like
a cosmic U-turn...

59:23.140 --> 59:25.460
and end up back
in Godzilla land?

59:25.500 --> 59:28.340
We don't have a choice,
unless you want to stay here.

59:28.380 --> 59:29.780
Well, maybe we should.

59:29.820 --> 59:31.260
Hold it.

59:31.340 --> 59:33.140
Yeah, right. Now,
forget about Mitsu...

59:33.180 --> 59:34.180
and give me the scepter
before you...

59:34.220 --> 59:35.660
Hey! Raph!

59:35.700 --> 59:37.140
Give me back the scepter...

59:37.140 --> 59:38.820
Give it over here!

59:41.100 --> 59:43.580
- Nice going.
- Butterfingers.

59:45.220 --> 59:46.700
What next?

59:51.700 --> 59:53.900
The Daimyo is coming
in the morning...

59:53.940 --> 59:57.180
with Walker and guns.

59:57.180 --> 59:58.180
Great.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.580
Oh, God, man.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.940
Hey, Yoshi.
You awake, buddy?

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.820
What's the matter,
little man?

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.380
What's up with those tears?

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:23.900
What's going on here?

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.420
Nothing.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.100
Nothing, huh?
Well, too bad.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.500
'Cause if something
was bothering you...

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.420
I got a little present
here to cheer you up.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.420
It's called a yo-yo.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.060
It's yours.
I made it for you.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.380
I was going to give it
to you tomorrow...

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.900
but, you know, things
might get a little nuts.

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.060
I might forget.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.300
You fight Daimyo in the morning?

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.020
OK, so tomorrow afternoon...

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.980
I'll teach you some tricks
on your yo-yo.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.140
OK, buddy?

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.620
Tomorrow you might die.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.500
Yeah. OK, Yoshi,
you listen to me.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.580
Tomorrow morning,
you and your buddies...

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.780
go up into the mountains
and you play, you hear me?

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.220
No matter what happens.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:13.460
I cannot let you die,
Raphael-san.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.700
Don't worry, kid.
Nobody's going to die.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.060
Hey, Yoshi, come on.
Where you going?

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.460
It's late already.
Get yourself to bed.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.820
What are you doing?

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.860
Yoshi, this isn't playtime.
Your sister's going to kill me.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.100
What do you got?

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.100
For you, Raphael-san.

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.740
You didn't have to.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.660
I find in the woods.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.900
Now you and the other
kappa can go home.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.780
Now you no die.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.300
Son of a snapper!

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.020
I found it!

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.660
Look at this.
It was here the whole time.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.020
It was under the house.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.860
Our little brother put it there.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.860
Mondo surprise!

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.620
We're set.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:08.580
Let me see that.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.860
Careful, now!
Easy, guys.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.780
- Is it the one?
- That's the one.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:12.740
Look, it's the scepter.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:14.340
Oh, God.
I can't believe it.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:18.620
So you see, as long as we
didn't have the scepter...

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.420
we had no choice
but to stay and fight.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.900
Right?

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.140
You mean, we were set up?

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.180
- Uncool.
- Very uncool.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.620
Mitsu.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.620
Is that for real?

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.380
The vibes in here
just turned bad.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:42.700
Let's split.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.700
Wait! I am the one.

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.300
Please. I am the one...

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.220
who told my grandson
to hide the scepter.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.500
What?

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:56.020
I want you to fight, not Mitsu.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.300
- Come on, guys!
- Let's go! Move it!

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.780
Evening.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.580
Let me at him!

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.980
Mikey, stay back.
Calm down, man.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:20.900
Give me the scepter,
my little green friends.

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.260
No! Kill him!

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.300
Raph, give me the scepter.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.220
Man!

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.060
Bring Kenshin
to the castle tonight.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.580
You'll get her back.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.900
Come morning,
I was you, I'd be gone.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:52.300
He's riding off.
Guys, we got to do something.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.460
I apologize for this crude
interruption, Daimyo...

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.060
but perhaps this little bird
will sing for your supper.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.180
Why have you stolen my son?

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.660
I do not have your son.

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.860
He's gone on a magic journey.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.660
Only the scepter
can bring him back.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.940
You are lying.
You have them both.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.940
I have nothing.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.180
He has the scepter.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.940
Not as chirpy as I'd hoped.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.900
Niles.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.100
Come on.
Come on!

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.460
Get out!
Out!

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.540
Take her away!

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.780
Come on! Move it!

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.820
How did you capture
such a woman?

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.740
The same way you capture
any wild animal.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.300
By setting a trap.

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:04.940
I don't have it.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.940
Equal partners.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.780
Right? I'm not
your spy anymore.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.620
I want to see the Daimyo.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:40.500
Easy with the hands.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:43.020
Another little birdie
come home to roost.

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.060
Well, April's inside.
Now it's up to us.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:52.260
Is this what they mean
by getting totally vertical?

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:56.220
Turtles... it's not just a job.
It's an adventure.

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.100
Meow, dude!

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.340
His chin's landed on my foot.

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.340
Sayonara, blubber butt.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.540
Mitsu!

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.100
How's it hanging, babe?

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.100
Michaelangelo.

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.980
Sorry about the crack
about the bad vibes.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.460
You got great vibes.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.820
Quickly.
We must free the others.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.260
Hey, Whit!

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.780
Well, well, well.
Miss O'Neil.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:04.620
My partner Mr. Whit and I were
just discussing your future.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.780
Let me tell you something
about your partner here.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.980
He's scum.

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.300
He's the lowest scum
of the earth.

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.140
No, you know something?
He's lower than scum.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.220
He gives scum a bad name.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.100
Of course he does.
That's why I hired him.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.660
Take her away.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.340
Now, wait a minute.

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:25.100
I have information
about the Daimyo's son.

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.260
I think she's
telling the truth.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.660
Really? Well, I don't
pay you to think, do I?

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.220
I pay you to lie,
cheat, and steal.

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.020
So why don't you go
down to the harbor...

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.140
and bring back the men
and their guns?

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.220
Guns?

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.220
Maybe she's up here.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:43.420
Nice and light now.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.180
Love the artwork.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.540
Reservations for five?

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.540
Under "T" maybe?

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.700
Come on! Let's go!

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.740
Move it!

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.740
That's OK, fellas.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.020
We'll find a table ourselves.

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.420
Little log there.

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.380
Everything looks cool up here.

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:01.100
Come on.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.940
Clear on the right.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.380
Clear on the left.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.500
Hey, you guys.
Check it out.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.700
- Ancient us.
- Trippy.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:20.380
"The battle of the
thousand swords."

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.220
Four demons defeated
the Daimyo and his army.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.420
Definitely family.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.300
Looks like me, but it's
got Raph's beak.

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:32.899
But it was only a legend.

01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:35.700
- Dudes, we're legends!
- Hey, cool!

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.140
I like it.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.140
Wayne Newton.

01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:42.779
You.

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:46.100
You were expecting maybe
the Addams family?

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:48.540
Good one.

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.100
You have come back.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.500
Yeah, we like to drop in...

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.979
about every three
or four centuries.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.300
Yeah, and it looks like
you're having a rough day...

01:08:55.340 --> 01:09:00.540
so give us the scepter back
and we'll get out of here.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:07.420
You have disgraced my ancestor,
but you will not disgrace me.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:08.460
I'm willing to die.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.979
Kill them.

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:16.620
We will both die, but only
one of us with honor.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.899
Are we out of the loop here
or what?

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:31.740
Chill, dude!

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:35.340
You OK?

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.660
Mikey, watch out!

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:41.500
Oh, he who dings
the shell must pay!

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:03.820
Your turn!

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.220
One, two, three, and kick!

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.340
Good night!

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.940
Bases loaded.
Home run!

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.300
Leapfrog!

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.820
Triple play!

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.580
Hello.

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:33.540
Good-bye.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.660
All right, good job, turtles.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.660
Yes!

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.060
Leo, high foot!

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.940
All right. Let's
rock 'n' roll, dudes.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.460
More logs.

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.740
Hey, mac!

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.180
Take the rest of the day off.

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.620
I'll open the dungeon.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.020
You guys go that way.

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.420
We must open the gate.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.860
No problemo.

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:00.140
Scuds!

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.500
One, two, three, four.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:10.020
You're free, guys.
Let's go!

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.860
I love this stuff!

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.820
I get such a kick
out of this job!

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.740
Hold it, bucko!

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:27.740
Big mistake, dude.

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.420
Go ahead.
Finish me.

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.380
There. Short enough for you?

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:57.620
Kappa.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:14.580
Hello?

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.020
Who's trapped inside?

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.660
Lord Norinaga.

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.340
Name rings a bell.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.460
Turtles one.
Daimyo zip.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.980
Look!

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.580
It's April.

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.980
Well, if it ain't
the phantom of the opera.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.380
Love to stay and chat, but...

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:45.100
places to go... people to kill.

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:52.860
Come on, lads!

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.780
Move it. Move it!

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:55.740
Out of the way!

01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:57.420
Oh, no. Guns!

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.780
There goes the neighborhood.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:00.420
Wait!

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.740
Thank you, Mr. Whit.

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:02.900
Yeah, Whit.

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:04.180
You make a great servant.

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.580
I'm real impressed.

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.940
My God!
Who's your tailor?

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:09.940
We're naked.

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.260
You OK, April?

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.140
Sorry, guys.

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.180
We really don't have time...

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:16.340
for any of these
social pleasantries...

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:17.420
I'm afraid.

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.500
Shoot them.

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:19.860
Right.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.060
Don't move a finger!

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:27.860
What did you say?

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.260
I said, shoot them.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:34.100
That wasn't part of
the deal, Walker.

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.620
Well, if you feel like that...

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.180
you'd better join them,
hadn't you?

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.460
- Niles!
- Right.

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:43.980
Hey, come on.

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.740
Shoot him, too.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.140
With pleasure!

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:48.620
Weasel!

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.140
Ready...

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.540
Gee, if we die here
in the past...

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:57.620
does that mean that we don't
get born in the future?

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.540
Hey, Tinkerbell,
why don't you shoot us?

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.580
Leo, wait...

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.980
I'm sorry.
Are you addressing me?

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:09.100
Shoot us yourself,
unless you're too scared.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.020
I get it!

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.940
He knows he can't kill us.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.780
We're demons.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.460
We are demons!

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.980
Your bullets will
just bounce back...

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.100
and kill all you guys instead.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.460
Right. What he said.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:25.940
Capisce?

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.900
Would you like the pleasure
of the first shot, Captain?

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.460
Go ahead, punk.
Make my day.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.220
If it's going to make you all
feel better...

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.940
I've got a good idea.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.060
Where's he going?

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.140
Out. Out of the way.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.980
What's he doing?

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.060
This doesn't bode well.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.460
Nice bluff, Mr. Leader.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.460
Major bummer.

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:57.380
We're toast.

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.420
Try this on for size.

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.740
This could hurt.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:13.900
Hoo, boy, do I love
being a turtle!

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.460
Yes. That's very clever.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.220
Oh, yes. Very clever.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.620
Missed me!

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.060
Guess what time it is?

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.620
Willy, willy, willy!
Willy, willy!

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.620
Take a hike, pal.

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.980
Let's get Walker!

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.380
Hey, guys!

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.820
Oh, look. Don King.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.060
Smells like a geek
ran through here.

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:57.660
My little guys.
I almost forgot you.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:58.860
Come on.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.340
Where'd he go?

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.420
There he goes.
Out the window.

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.660
Over there!
Let's go!

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.620
Come on, Mikey.

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:09.580
We'll go out front
and cut him off.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:10.900
Come on, guys!

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:15.420
Hurry, Raph.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.060
Right behind you, Leo.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.660
He's up there, Donny. Come on.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.020
All right. Let's go.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.620
This is so good for your calves.

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:36.980
Stop right there!

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.900
Or you're a goner, dude.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.460
Totally.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.060
What kind of demons are you?

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.260
We're turtles, friend.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:56.340
Of the teenage mutant
ninja variety, sleazeball!

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.660
Check it out!

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:16.460
This, I believe, is what
you've been searching for.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.420
Go fetch.

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.060
Wait! There goes
our ride home!

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.220
Do you really think
I'd make it that easy...

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:29.380
you nasty little reptiles?

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.940
I got it!
I got it!

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:32.340
I call!

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.580
Oh, not again!

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.020
Mikey, get it!

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.700
Go, Mike, go!

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.100
Nice catch. I got you!

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.460
We got it.

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:14.420
Bungee jumping without a bungee.
That could be dangerous.

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.500
You got that.

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.380
Hey, guys.

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.860
We have an egg timer to catch.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.740
Let's move it.

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.260
Buckle up, dudes.
It's time to go home.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.700
Hey, guys.
I'm not going back.

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.140
- What?
- What did you say?

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.820
I said I'm staying here.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.780
I'm not going back with you.

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:42.900
Michaelangelo, come on.

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.020
You can't be serious.

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:46.220
He's serious.

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:48.380
Hey, wait a minute.

01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:51.660
You are going back to New York.

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.460
Been there, done that.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.500
Michaelangelo, it's our home.

01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:00.100
Sure. Your home's
a nice apartment.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:02.060
My home's a sewer.

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:04.300
I been thinking
the same thing, Leo.

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.460
People appreciate us here.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:07.820
We don't have to
live like moles.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.860
Hey, whoa.
No way!

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:12.780
We're all going back.
Tell him, Leo.

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:13.860
Actually...

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:16.140
Hey, not to sound
selfish or anything...

01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:17.740
but what the heck.
Why not?

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.700
I do not want to stay here.

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:21.660
Me, neither.

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.740
Do you think I could
possibly live...

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.860
without a single microchip?

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:29.820
Somebody's activated
the scepter.

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.380
We got to go now!

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.300
Kenshin, no!

01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:39.100
We wait four hundred years,
and this Casey is still late.

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.020
I will wait no longer.

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.380
Kenshin, you cannot go
without the others.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.580
It would be cowardly.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.460
Come on. Both of you.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.820
Yeah. Come on.
Got to get back.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.740
Time to go.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.500
Come on, you party animals.
I know. Yeah.

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.460
OK. Come on.
Get it together.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.860
I just wanted
to give you guys...

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.140
a nice peek at the future,
all right?

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:13.900
Bet you guys feel lucky
to be going back, right?

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:16.580
Very lucky.
We're going back.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.180
Not!

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.660
This could really
screw up history.

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.540
All right. OK.
Enough is enough.

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.860
OK? Let's go.
Come on.

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.860
Guys, you cannot split up.

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.980
You're brothers.
Remember?

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.780
Yeah. I guess.

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:39.500
Raphael-san.

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:40.780
Hey, Yoshi.

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.460
Yoshi wants to say good-bye.

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.820
But we're not going back.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.100
Me and Raph are
going to be staying.

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.100
No!

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.620
Kenshin must return.

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:53.940
You promised.

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.300
Yeah, but...

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:59.700
Our two families must be united,
or the wars will start again.

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.020
But I thought...

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:05.140
I want to stay here with you.

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.980
You will always
be here with me...

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.500
Michaelangelo.

01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.740
Uh-oh, guys.
It's picking up speed.

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:16.980
Come on!

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.540
There was traffic, man.

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.500
Benkei, no! Wait. No!

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:30.220
I been thinking.
We have to go back.

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.740
It's our destiny.

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:34.740
I mean, if we stay here...

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.660
we interfere with their lives,
and that would be selfish.

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:38.980
Exactly.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.860
Our lives are in New York.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:41.900
Right, guys?

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.820
It's "Star Trek" time, guys.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.140
Hey, Yoshi man.

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.580
Raphael-san.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.020
Yo, Yoshi.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.860
I will never forget you,
Raphael-san.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:57.900
I won't forget you, either,
little man.

01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:59.620
And remember, watch that temper.

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:03.620
Hey, all right!

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.980
No, no, no.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.540
I'll put this on layaway
for you, OK?

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.820
All right?
Give you an excuse...

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:12.700
to come back, Zen Meister, OK?

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.220
All right.

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:17.500
Benkei!

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.460
You got a bus to catch.

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:23.380
Come on. Go ahead.
Go ahead. Good.

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.420
It's OK, man.
Go ahead.

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.700
It'll be all right.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.900
Benkei!

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:33.820
See you later.

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:35.340
Later.

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.940
Come on, Mikey!

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:39.460
If you ever get to New York...

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:40.620
Yeah, later, Mikey!

01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:45.100
OK. Destiny... what a drag! Bye.

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.580
Mikey! Hurry!

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:49.180
I'm coming!

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:51.420
Come on, Mikey!
Come on!

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:56.300
Mikey!

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.300
Guys, we made it back
to the den.

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.340
Michaelangelo?

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.780
Mikey?

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500
- Get that guy!
- He's got the scepter!

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:28.300
- No!
- Get him!

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:29.900
Grab him!

01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.420
Oh, boy.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.420
You made it back!

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.740
We thought we lost you
forever, Mikey.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.660
Thought you were a goner!

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.060
- I'm glad you're OK.
- Hi, guys.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.380
Michaelangelo.

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:18.820
Father.

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:21.620
Kenshin.

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.340
Hockey.

01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:52.180
Hockey.

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:07.940
Kenshin!

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.380
Michaelangelo?

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.660
Yes, Master Splinter?

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:22.220
Something deeply
troubles you, my son.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.500
Growing up.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.220
I don't think
I'll ever laugh again.

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.620
Yo, dude!

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.980
Yo, dude!

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:40.380
Just like Elvis
in "Blue Hawaii."

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.180
I saw it on cable.

01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:48.100
Oh, boy.

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.100
Hey, Mikey!

01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:57.340
Gone.

01:26:58.305 --> 01:27:04.827
