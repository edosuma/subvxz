00:58.520 --> 01:00.556
<i>What a spectacle.</i>

01:02.200 --> 01:05.158
<i>Millions and millions of stars.</i>

01:07.440 --> 01:10.113
<i>Funny thing, the universe.</i>

01:11.360 --> 01:14.158
<i>Sort of scares the shit out of you,</i>
<i>doesn't it?</i>

01:14.640 --> 01:17.234
<i>So where did it</i>
<i>all come from, do you think?</i>

01:17.320 --> 01:19.311
<i>Don't know.</i>

01:19.760 --> 01:21.876
<i>Just happened, I suppose.</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:25.991
<i>So, what about when we die?</i>

01:26.680 --> 01:28.477
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:28.560 --> 01:30.278
<i>Nothing at all?</i>

01:44.560 --> 01:47.597
What fathead has caused all this?

01:49.200 --> 01:52.476
Listen... the first race has started.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.313
Ridiculous.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.392
All that money to sit in a queue.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.677
Arthur! Just relax, will you?

02:04.600 --> 02:06.079
I know, how about a song?

02:16.200 --> 02:18.509
- There's been an accident.
- Where?!

02:18.600 --> 02:21.068
I don't know, do I, fathead?!

02:21.160 --> 02:23.594
That's what we're gonna find out.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.637
Why can't you just sit and wait
like everybody else?

02:30.720 --> 02:33.518
- Show them the stethoscope, pet.
- What for?

02:33.600 --> 02:36.398
- Let them know we're doctors.
- We'll do no such thing.

02:36.480 --> 02:40.359
- What are you doing?
- It's all right. I'm a doctor.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.352
I'm a doctor, there's been an accident.
I'm a doctor.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.279
<i>This is the way</i>
<i>that it was with my father.</i>

02:48.360 --> 02:51.033
<i>Minor duplicities.</i>
<i>Little fiddles.</i>

02:51.120 --> 02:54.715
<i>My childhood a web</i>
<i>of little scams and triumphs.</i>

02:54.800 --> 02:57.917
<i>Parking where you shouldn't.</i>
<i>Drinking after hours.</i>

02:58.000 --> 03:00.912
<i>The goods off the back of a lorry.</i>

03:01.000 --> 03:04.117
<i>He was lost if he couldn't cheat</i>
<i>in a small way.</i>

03:04.200 --> 03:07.795
<i>My father could talk his way</i>
<i>into and out of anything.</i>

03:10.280 --> 03:13.511
- Tickets, sir.
- Certainly, here you are.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.716
- These are blue tickets, sir.
- Exactly.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.190
That is the whole problem.
I've been sent the wrong tickets.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.431
I'm sorry, sir. This entrance
is for private members only.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.592
- You'll have to go back to queue.
- But I am a member. See?

03:25.680 --> 03:28.717
Simpson, T, Trevor. Doctor, you see?

03:28.800 --> 03:32.236
As a matter of fact, we're in a bit
of a rush. The lad wants a wee-wee.

03:35.880 --> 03:39.839
- All right, Dr Simpson, in you go.
- Thank you very much.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.192
How about that, Blake?
Three bob tickets for just two bob.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.316
Marvellous, bloody marvellous.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.594
<i>My father seemed to me infallible.</i>

03:53.680 --> 03:55.671
<i>Invincible.</i>

03:55.760 --> 03:57.512
<i>Immortal, even.</i>

04:26.840 --> 04:28.796
What do you think?

04:28.880 --> 04:30.996
Very handsome.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.076
- I hope I'm going to get a mention.
- Mention?

04:36.160 --> 04:39.277
- In your acceptance speech.
- Oh, God, a speech.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.920
You really think
I'm going to have to make a speech?

05:00.280 --> 05:03.397
- Do we have time?
- I think so.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.718
What's going on in there?

05:16.800 --> 05:19.633
Right on cue.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.393
The sex police.
Be right there, Dad!

05:22.480 --> 05:25.199
We'll be late!
You got two minutes.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.918
Hear that? We got two minutes.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.835
At the risk of getting sentimental, I'd
like to say thank-you to my wife, Kathy.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.388
Not only for all her support
and encouragement,

05:38.480 --> 05:41.392
but because she asked me to mention her.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.350
My dad always used to say,

05:44.440 --> 05:47.238
and I'm sure he'll say it again
before the night's out,

05:47.320 --> 05:50.915
"Being a writer, in particular a poet,
is all well and good.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.753
But it's no way to make a living."

05:53.840 --> 05:56.877
Of course, as in most other things,
he's absolutely right.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.520
Too true.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.876
It's nice to be reminded I haven't been
completely wasting my time.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.428
So thank you very much for this.
Thank you.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.196
I wanted him to be a doctor.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.989
Nice pension, surgery, near us.
Take over my surgery for that matter.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.877
Have you actually read the poem?

06:19.960 --> 06:22.110
- 'Course he hasn't read it.
- He's tried.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.033
- Several times.
- Let's have a look then.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.678
- It's plastic.
- I'll take that from you, shall I?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.876
I'm going to the bar.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.518
He could've been a vet even.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.479
Two words, that's all I'd like.
Two words.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.630
- "Well" and "done".
- He doesn't mean it.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.358
He's here for the free buffet.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.274
The mean-spirited, sanctimonious,
narrow-minded old sod.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.796
- What now?
- He's talking to Salman Rushdie.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.314
Look, he's telling him
how it's done.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.995
"Have you read <i>Jaws,</i>
Salman? Now that is a book."

07:03.720 --> 07:06.473
- Together.
- Like this, Granddad?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.949
Oh, now where are you going?

07:10.680 --> 07:11.908
What's that?

07:12.200 --> 07:14.031
Have a guess.

07:14.120 --> 07:17.396
Now bring it to me. No, no, no.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.275
- Ends together. Like that.
- Just leave that, Dad.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.239
I still can't believe you hired a
removal firm. They're rip-off merchants.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.118
We could've done the whole thing
for nothing in the van.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.034
- There was too much stuff for the van.
- You can afford it on what you earn?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.514
Who wants to take mummy
up some breakfast?

07:37.600 --> 07:39.591
- Bye, Granddaddy.
- See you later.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.318
My little helpers!

07:41.400 --> 07:45.188
- I do all right, Dad.
- Why'd you borrow this money off me?

07:45.280 --> 07:48.397
- If you were a doctor...
- A bit late for this conversation.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.153
- What's this doing here?
- It's going in the loft.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.516
- This is Uncle Bert's chandelier.
- It's wire and glass, Dad.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.038
Right. I'm going to need a stepladder.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.431
Phillips screwdriver.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.397
Length of rope.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.236
- Dad?
- It's all right.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.993
Don't fuss. It's nothing.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.954
Your father's going to die, Blake.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.874
Of course we all die sooner or later,
but I'm afraid, with your father,

08:48.960 --> 08:51.110
it will be sooner.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.634
- Will there be pain?
- There shouldn't be.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.871
Not with this kind of cancer.
Usually they just slip away.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.110
- So how long?
- Can't say.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.760
Depends if he feels like fighting.

09:04.840 --> 09:05.989
He knows then?

09:06.080 --> 09:09.550
He asked me the moment he came around.
So I put him in the picture.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.033
- But we do have time?
- That depends.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.475
- Time for what?
- Well, time for...

09:19.560 --> 09:22.074
...you know, putting things in order.

09:22.760 --> 09:26.150
<i>That means you have</i>
<i>to get the conundrum.</i>

09:26.240 --> 09:29.118
<i>If you do, you will win</i>
<i>by just one point.</i>

09:29.200 --> 09:32.715
<i>It's so dramatic, I want to spell it out</i>
<i>so we all know what lies ahead</i>

09:32.800 --> 09:34.916
<i>in the next few seconds. OK.</i>

09:35.000 --> 09:37.468
<i>So very intense time for everybody now.</i>

09:37.560 --> 09:41.235
<i>Please now, if everyone's ready,</i>
<i>reveal the final</i>

09:41.320 --> 09:43.629
<i>Countdown Conundrum.</i>

09:43.720 --> 09:46.712
- What did the doctor say?
- He said there's progress.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.350
Said you'd be back home soon.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.198
<i>... young woman was</i>
<i>discovered in a house</i>

09:54.280 --> 09:57.397
<i>in the Clacton area of Leeds</i>
<i>just after midnight last night.</i>

09:57.480 --> 10:00.438
Terrible. Just terrible.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.239
- Know what I'd do?
- Bring back hanging?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.272
Go if you want.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.397
Actually, maybe I will,
if that's OK.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.597
I'll pop back when you're home?
Bring Kathy and the kids?

10:15.680 --> 10:17.671
What do I want visitors for?

10:17.760 --> 10:19.796
Not now, but maybe when you're at home.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.270
Come in, number one. Your time's up.
Number two, your time's up.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.510
Come in, number three.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.635
I'd better go, or I'll miss the train.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.438
See you soon.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.151
We're looking for Arthur Morrison.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.391
Arthur Morrison. Back corridor.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.629
Thank you.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.075
I came as quickly as I could.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.116
Am I too late?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.070
Who's that then?

12:01.160 --> 12:02.957
It's Blake, Dad.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.517
Blake. Blake, good.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.070
How did you get from the station?

12:11.160 --> 12:13.151
Taxi.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.596
Taxi, eh? Moneybags.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.158
When did His Lordship arrive?

12:31.240 --> 12:33.231
Just now.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.996
He's with him now.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.992
- Back in London by teatime.
- Gillian.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.833
That's enough.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.718
How's he taking it?

12:44.800 --> 12:47.314
- Don't know yet.
- Hello.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.038
Hi.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.872
All right.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.556
Get off.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.672
- Bloody thing.
- Just trying to remember who you are.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.394
She's just very pleased
to see you.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.948
Arthur's very pleased too.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.637
- Is he?
- Of course he is.

13:11.720 --> 13:16.919
Gosh, "Where's Blake? Where's Blake?"
Is all I've had for days now.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.794
Sorry, I would've gotten down sooner,
it's that new house and everything.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.519
No, it's fine, darling.
He knows how busy you are.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.430
I made up your old bedroom,

13:27.520 --> 13:30.114
when you want to take your stuff up.

13:30.720 --> 13:34.599
Down the corridor, up the stairs,
first on the right.

13:52.360 --> 13:56.911
Blake? Blake, where are you?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.309
Come on. She's here.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.948
Come on, chop-chop.

14:06.040 --> 14:09.510
She's here, Blake.
Come and say hello.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.318
Blake!

14:22.120 --> 14:26.636
Sandra, how are you?
I'm Arthur. This is Kim.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.950
This is our youngest, Gillian.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.270
Blake is somewhere,
probably still asleep.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.796
On a beautiful day like today.
Blake, come and say hello to Sandra.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.877
This is the kitchen.
Have you ever cooked on an Aga before?

14:54.960 --> 14:57.235
- No.
- Sandra, would you like a cup of tea?

14:57.320 --> 14:58.309
Yes, please.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.390
There he is! Sleeping Beauty.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.596
Blake, meet Sandra, our new maid.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.195
Maid or housekeeper?
Skivvy! I'm joking.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.431
- Let's just say one of the family.
- Pleased to meet you, Blake.

15:12.520 --> 15:16.115
- You're Scottish.
- Oh, what gave you that impression?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.116
- Whereabouts in Scotland?
- Glasgow.

15:19.200 --> 15:23.159
- Oh, Glasgow.
- Ever been to Glasgow?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.479
No. No, I haven't.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.510
Right! Well, let me show you your room,
you can get settled in,

15:31.600 --> 15:35.593
and then we'd like you to start
sweeping the chimneys. Just joking.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.070
Follow me, quick as you like.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.593
Mind the step.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.114
On the left,
that's Blake's room.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.191
Avoid at all costs, if I were you.

16:00.280 --> 16:03.716
The last maid we had went in there,
haven't seen her since.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.678
No, seriously, we do have some fun.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.672
It was stupid, really.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.389
You spend your life trying to avoid
someone, and then it's too late.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.436
<i>Why can't you talk to him now?</i>

16:14.520 --> 16:16.909
He's so doped up, I could be anyone.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.911
<i>I'm sure there'll be time.</i>

16:19.000 --> 16:21.833
Yeah, well, you haven't seen him,
have you?

16:21.920 --> 16:24.992
<i>No. No, I suppose not.</i>

16:27.040 --> 16:28.439
The kids are here.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.750
<i>Do you want to talk to them?</i>

16:30.840 --> 16:33.035
No, not just now, eh?

16:33.120 --> 16:35.918
Really? 'Cause they want to talk to you.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.991
Yeah, OK, put them on, will you?

16:39.360 --> 16:42.193
- <i>Miss you.</i>
- You too.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.592
He wants you to go through
all the papers.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.399
He thinks I won't understand it.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.069
I'll start tomorrow.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.870
Good luck.

17:01.960 --> 17:05.474
He's got every petrol receipt
since 1949 in there.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.190
And then there's the workshop.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.950
- You seen Sandra much?
- Now and then, yeah.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.517
She's moved into the village.

17:23.599 --> 17:27.229
One of those worker's cottages,
you know?

17:27.319 --> 17:29.117
Divorced.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.276
Why do you ask?

17:32.360 --> 17:34.078
Just curious.

17:41.680 --> 17:45.389
<i>President Kennedy</i>
<i>meanwhile remains incorrigible,</i>

17:45.480 --> 17:49.917
<i>and in a momentous decision, has</i>
<i>ordered an arms blockade of Cuba.</i>

17:50.000 --> 17:52.355
<i>This government, as promised...</i>

17:52.440 --> 17:54.237
Missed a bit.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.869
- You could help.
- Sorry. Busy.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.669
- Oh yeah? Doing what?
- Busy smoking my fag.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.032
- Give us a puff.
- No way.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.599
- Go on.
- No.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.636
- What if your dad finds out?
- He won't.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.188
He will. Your dad's all-seeing.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.874
- Like God.
- Omniscient, you mean?

18:14.960 --> 18:17.394
Aye, omni-whatever.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.872
Besides, it's bad for you,
gives you cancer.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.349
So? We'll all be dead soon, anyway.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.750
- Well, you're a little ray of sunshine.
- It's true.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.310
If the Americans invade Cuba,
there'll be nuclear war by Friday.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.914
Just think... dead.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.956
And me, still a virgin.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.155
Don't push your luck, Morrison.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.156
You're still here then?

19:46.680 --> 19:48.636
You're not running off?

19:49.640 --> 19:51.756
I'm here for a while, Dad.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.430
Yes, smashing. Smashing.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.876
- I don't understand, what's it for?
- It's for sleeping outdoors.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.996
It's like a normal sleeping bag,

20:27.080 --> 20:31.517
but inside, a waterproof sleeve to keep
out the rain and condensation.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.750
It will render the tent obsolete.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.833
- You'll still get condensation inside.
- No, you won't, 'cause it's plastic.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.196
- It's waterproof, see?
- But condensation's on the inside...

20:41.280 --> 20:45.034
We'll find out when we put it
to the test, won't we, clever-clogs?

20:49.040 --> 20:51.759
- I made two, see?
- What for?

20:52.680 --> 20:54.432
One for me, one for you.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.350
- Thought I'd take the car out.
- Oh, the... the...

21:00.440 --> 21:03.876
The headlights don't work,
so make sure you're back before dark.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.111
He was gonna take it into the garage.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.951
Halfords.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.469
What, love?

21:13.560 --> 21:17.030
New headlights.
Halfords will be cheaper.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.756
Herpes is all right.
It's easily sorted with antibiotics.

21:26.840 --> 21:30.833
But gonorrhoea's a bastard.
Lots of the lads had it in the war.

21:30.920 --> 21:34.799
Once you've seen what a dose of
gonorrhoea can do to a lad's tackle...

21:34.880 --> 21:38.270
I've got pictures in books at home
that'd turn your stomach.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.749
If there's another war
would you get called up?

21:40.840 --> 21:43.991
I wouldn't have thought so.
There's not going be another war.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.958
- You keeping an eye out for the police?
- Yes, Dad.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.315
Self abuse, that's the thing
to be wary of.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.073
- Dad, please...
- It seems like good fun, I know,

21:52.160 --> 21:56.039
but it actually weakens the organ
for married life.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.759
- Police car, right behind us, Dad!
- Really? Where?

21:58.840 --> 22:00.990
Just... over there.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.154
Very funny... very smart.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.710
Bloody marvellous, isn't it?

22:13.200 --> 22:16.033
If they drop the bomb on Leeds,
would it get us up here?

22:16.120 --> 22:18.236
I wouldn't have thought so.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.436
It's God's own country.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.078
What about Mum and Gillian?

22:22.880 --> 22:25.758
I think Mummy and Gillian
will be fine too.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.639
What if they drop the bomb on Blackpool?

22:29.720 --> 22:33.474
Why on earth would the communists
want bomb Blackpool, fathead?

22:34.920 --> 22:36.478
Liverpool, then?

22:36.560 --> 22:39.154
It's a bit bloody morbid,
this, isn't it?

22:39.240 --> 22:42.755
Come on, lets go and find somewhere
to camp before it starts raining.

22:52.960 --> 22:57.033
It's a lovely spot. Nice and sheltered,
river nearby for swimming.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.875
- Shouldn't we go to a proper campsite?
- It's the English countryside.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.632
We're English. It belongs to us.

23:05.080 --> 23:08.470
Maybe we should pitch the tent first,
just to be on the safe side.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.515
Is there a canvas bag in there, Blake?

23:16.600 --> 23:19.433
- Yep, yep.
- What's in it?

23:19.520 --> 23:23.035
- Tent pegs.
- No poles?

23:23.120 --> 23:26.192
- No, just some pegs.
- Let's have a look.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.868
Oh, blast! Hell, blast and damnation!

23:32.960 --> 23:34.916
Why didn't you check, fathead?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.673
- You packed the tent.
- You used it last, didn't you?

23:37.760 --> 23:41.070
- No, I didn't. You...
- There's no point in arguing about it.

23:42.760 --> 23:45.479
- What you doing?
- Right! Follow me!

23:51.320 --> 23:54.039
- Can't we sleep in the car?
- Sleep in the car?

23:54.120 --> 23:57.715
What's the point of us coming all
the way up here and sleeping in the car?

23:57.800 --> 23:59.995
A hotel then?
Maybe we should just go home.

24:00.080 --> 24:04.153
Look, hold that and stop moaning,
for God's sake.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.631
Mummy says hello.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.109
Pub was bloody miles away.

24:22.200 --> 24:26.079
Felt a bit rude just to use the phone
so stayed for a swift half.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.720
No sandwiches though.
Here you are, supper.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.997
- Not hungry.
- Fair enough. Breakfast then.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.673
Do you want to put the torch out, eh?
Save on batteries.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.751
If you like.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.195
- Night-night, Blake.
- Night.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.679
Dad!

25:22.240 --> 25:24.071
Oh, my book!

25:24.160 --> 25:27.152
It could have been a lot worse.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.231
How, exactly?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.709
If our sleeping bags weren't waterproof.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.360
They're not waterproof!

25:35.240 --> 25:38.471
- They are waterproof.
- So why am I wet, then?

25:38.560 --> 25:41.757
Well, not waterproof, water-resistant.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.358
It's not funny.

25:45.560 --> 25:49.235
- Where are we going?
- I thought I'd drive us up to Scafell.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.595
Can't we just go home?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.910
We've only just started!

25:54.000 --> 25:57.037
Besides, the sun will burn this cloud
off in next to no time.

25:57.120 --> 26:01.796
We can dry the tent out on a hedge,
have a picnic and find another spot.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.109
What do you say?

26:04.200 --> 26:07.909
<i>The unrest followed</i>
<i>a radio broadcast in which Khrushchev</i>

26:08.000 --> 26:10.309
<i>reiterated his command</i>
<i>missile bases...</i>

26:10.400 --> 26:12.709
I was listening to that!

26:12.800 --> 26:15.997
No point in fretting.
We all have die sooner or later.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.593
If our times up, our times up.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.750
That's more like it. Smashing.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.352
I'm not going swimming,
if that's what you're thinking.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.759
- I'm wet enough, as it is.
- Right, budge over, you!

27:02.840 --> 27:06.310
- What for?
- Time you learnt to drive.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.397
You're joking?

27:08.480 --> 27:09.595
What, here?

27:09.680 --> 27:11.875
Here there's no one
for you to smash into.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.076
Come on, budge over!

27:17.880 --> 27:22.271
Very gently off the clutch.
No, gently! Gently! Stop!

27:23.360 --> 27:27.069
First gear. Top left.
Top left, that's it. Come on.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.549
Come on. Gently!

27:30.000 --> 27:33.151
- Clutch! No, fathead, left foot.
- You told me...

27:33.240 --> 27:36.516
That's it. Now gently.
Second into third.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.318
That's it, that's it. Good.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.675
Now gently away. Good.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.435
Excellent. Now indicate.
Indicate right. Come on, indicate right!

27:44.520 --> 27:45.999
- OK!
- Now, indicate left!

27:46.080 --> 27:48.753
- Indicate left.
- What am I indicating for?

27:48.840 --> 27:52.515
- Because you mustn't get in bad habits.
- There's no one here, Dad.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.797
Come on! Hard round,
left hand down. That's it.

27:55.880 --> 27:59.873
- Now, right hand down.
- Dad! Please!

28:04.440 --> 28:07.955
Faster, don't worry about it.
Don't be scared, just go faster.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.917
- It's a bit fast.
- You can go faster.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.672
Faster than this?

28:16.040 --> 28:18.634
Quick! Come on! That's it!

28:18.720 --> 28:21.359
Excellent, do you like it?
Good. Are you ready?

28:21.440 --> 28:23.431
One... two... three!

28:23.520 --> 28:24.999
Now!

28:40.240 --> 28:43.073
Come on. Come on.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.077
Come on out, you little sod!

28:50.000 --> 28:52.594
Come on. Come on, get up.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.113
- Hello?
- <i>Hi.</i>

29:29.200 --> 29:31.919
- Oh, it's you.
- <i>Who else were you expecting?</i>

29:32.000 --> 29:34.355
I just... I thought it might be mum.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.159
I'm walking the dog.
Mind if I call you when I get back?

29:37.240 --> 29:39.071
<i>Yeah, yeah, sure.</i>

29:41.120 --> 29:43.680
- As soon as I get in. Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

29:43.760 --> 29:46.911
Come on... Stupid, stupid, stupid.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.909
- <i>Sending you mad is he?</i>
- <i>I'm getting your migraines.</i>

29:55.800 --> 29:57.472
Can't you come and rescue me?

29:57.560 --> 30:01.678
<i>Sorry, love, it's men only.</i>
<i>You're on your own, I'm afraid.</i>

30:01.760 --> 30:04.149
Did he blame me for that
tent pole business?

30:04.240 --> 30:06.276
<i>What tent pole business?</i>

30:06.360 --> 30:10.512
- Didn't he tell you last night?
- <i>I took a sleeping pill. Why?</i>

30:10.600 --> 30:13.114
<i>What happened with the tent poles?</i>

30:14.000 --> 30:16.673
<i>Blake? You there?</i>

30:17.680 --> 30:19.796
He woke me at six in the morning!

30:19.880 --> 30:22.553
That's never happened before.
Something must be up.

30:22.640 --> 30:27.555
I wasn't far wrong. I realised we were
sleeping in two foot of water.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.835
The bloody stream had burst it's banks.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.549
Blake gave me a look like thunder.
I thought he was going to punch me one.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.551
Excuse me a minute.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.953
Here you are, a present for you.
Don't tell Mummy. You'll get me shot.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.431
- Where are you going?
- Phone her.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.476
What, again?

30:46.560 --> 30:49.154
I just want to make sure
she's managing without us.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.789
If anyone asks, you're 36!

31:07.120 --> 31:09.634
I wish you were here too.

31:10.240 --> 31:13.232
I know, but what can we do?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.833
Don't be daft. You know I do.

31:19.560 --> 31:23.599
Well, there's no point in worrying
about it. Everything's gonna be fine.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.194
After all, where's the harm?

31:27.080 --> 31:30.311
Yes. Yeah, we will, we will.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.913
How are you doing, Stirling Moss?
Behaving yourself?

32:02.160 --> 32:05.357
- Right, one for the road?
- I'm going to bed.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.032
Good idea.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.070
- How was Mum?
- What?

32:10.160 --> 32:12.879
Oh, she was asleep.
I said I'd call her in the morning.

32:12.960 --> 32:16.555
- Hey, Arthur? Have you heard the news?
- No, turn it up.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.438
<i>Soviet missiles</i>
<i>should be removed from Cuba</i>

32:19.520 --> 32:21.988
<i>under United Nations supervision.</i>

32:22.080 --> 32:24.913
<i>Further details of the deal</i>
<i>have yet to become clear.</i>

32:25.000 --> 32:29.630
<i>But it seems that for tonight, at least,</i>
<i>the world can sleep a little safer.</i>

32:33.240 --> 32:36.949
What did I tell you? No point in getting
worked up about it, was there?

32:37.040 --> 32:38.871
Are you all right?

32:42.080 --> 32:44.878
So... to Kennedy, then.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.996
To Kennedy.

32:50.240 --> 32:54.153
That went down well.
Think I can sneak in one more.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.958
I think I'll pop you
in the boot too.

33:16.040 --> 33:20.556
- Why can't you go instead?
- Not today, Blake.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.598
Why? Have you got one
of your migraines?

33:26.520 --> 33:30.718
No. Not yet, anyway.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.997
No, I've got patients to see,
that's all.

33:34.080 --> 33:38.198
Somebody's got to keep that surgery
running while Dad is off gadding about.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.072
But why does Aunty Beaty
always have to come?

33:44.160 --> 33:47.277
Well, because your Aunty Beaty
gets a bit blue.

33:47.360 --> 33:52.036
- And your Dad likes cheering her up.
- I'd still prefer it if you came.

33:52.120 --> 33:55.874
Would you stop grizzling,
for goodness sake!

33:57.720 --> 34:00.234
Look, darling, I'm sorry.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.795
But you'll have fun. Go on.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.678
Go on. OK.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.389
Oh, one more!

34:13.719 --> 34:15.949
One, two, three!

34:51.440 --> 34:54.351
Let's get you down.
Come on, let's have some lunch.

34:54.440 --> 34:58.149
Boom-boom. Boom-boom.
Boom-boom. Boom-boom.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.674
Can you hear it?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.355
Pumping away?

35:04.960 --> 35:06.678
Can I have a go?

35:08.960 --> 35:11.633
Blake, you and Gillian
take Josie down the hill

35:11.720 --> 35:14.154
whilst Aunty Beaty and I
get the picnic ready.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.716
- Arthur, I don't think...
- No, no. Nonsense.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.950
You can look after the ladies,
can't you?

35:21.040 --> 35:23.235
Big, strong lad like you.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.992
Go on, off you go!

35:46.440 --> 35:48.396
What are you doing, Blake?

35:48.480 --> 35:51.313
- What does it look like?
- Stop showing off. You'll fall!

35:51.400 --> 35:55.678
- I won't fall.
- Blake, come down. You're too high!

35:56.160 --> 35:57.957
Blake!

36:09.080 --> 36:10.911
- Blake!
- Blake!

36:11.720 --> 36:14.757
Blake!

36:39.880 --> 36:44.237
Blake, what the hell do you think you're
playing at, sneaking up on people?

36:44.320 --> 36:46.834
I fell out of a tree.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.354
How did you get up a tree? Fly up?

36:50.920 --> 36:53.229
I don't think
we're going to have to amputate.

36:53.320 --> 36:56.039
But I am going to put
some antiseptic on it.

36:56.120 --> 36:59.635
And that's going to sting a bit.
Brave enough?

37:02.600 --> 37:06.991
Now, that's it. You take
that end, now take this end...

37:07.680 --> 37:09.272
Now...

37:09.360 --> 37:11.828
...best not to tell Mummy
about any of this, eh?

37:11.920 --> 37:14.150
You'll get me in trouble.
Is that a deal?

37:16.200 --> 37:19.112
Now remember, big boys don't cry.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.430
Especially not in front of girls.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.435
Show them how brave you are!

37:24.520 --> 37:26.238
All right?

37:27.800 --> 37:29.358
Good boy.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.549
Another swig of wine, please.

37:51.920 --> 37:55.515
"Swig." Funny word, "swig."

37:57.960 --> 38:00.474
Have you been through the papers yet?

38:00.560 --> 38:02.949
The stocks and tax and stuff?

38:03.560 --> 38:05.152
Not yet, Dad. No.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.959
Have a look at it all, will you?

38:08.040 --> 38:10.270
Your Mother's a bit scared of it,
I think.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.679
I will, yes.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.196
Sometime soon, all right?

38:33.400 --> 38:34.992
Who's that?

38:36.200 --> 38:37.952
Robert Morrison.

38:38.040 --> 38:42.113
Died 1948, run over by a horse.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.674
Drunk, probably.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.756
It says here that Daniel Morrison...

38:58.840 --> 39:01.593
...married his wife's sister
as well as his wife.

39:01.680 --> 39:06.231
Yes, his first wife died in
childbirth, and he married the sister.

39:06.320 --> 39:09.756
Yes, God, you weren't allowed
to mention Daniel, either.

39:09.840 --> 39:13.594
- All this scandal.
- Well...

39:13.680 --> 39:15.398
...now it can come out.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.158
What did Granddad die of, Mum?

39:19.600 --> 39:22.876
Oh... cancer, I think. Yeah.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.155
- Bowel?
- Mm-hmm.

39:27.560 --> 39:30.711
I think you've one
or two more years yet, Blake.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.031
I remember when Granddad died.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.315
Dad cried for months.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.676
I remember at the wake,
somebody came up him and asked him,

39:41.760 --> 39:44.593
"When did you last
see your father?" and...

39:44.680 --> 39:47.035
...he just went to pieces.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.952
Blake! Say hello
to Beaty and Sam.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.634
Hello, Beaty and Sam.

40:00.760 --> 40:04.389
Blake? Where are you?
Come down and say hello.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.950
- You're meant to knock.
- Look who's come to see you.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.395
- Hello, Josie.
- Hello.

40:26.480 --> 40:29.392
- What are you up to, then?
- I'm reading.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.516
About someone who murders his father.

40:31.600 --> 40:35.195
Well, read it later. Come downstairs,
Beaty and Sam are here.

40:35.280 --> 40:38.192
- Why can't I just?
- Because it's Christmas!

40:38.280 --> 40:41.909
What are you drinking these days, Josie?
Vodka? Brandy?

40:55.720 --> 40:57.517
There you are!

40:57.600 --> 41:01.070
We were about to send out
a search party for you, young man.

41:02.480 --> 41:05.472
Never a piece of mistletoe
when you need one. Oh, well.

41:07.160 --> 41:10.516
Merry Christmas, Blake.
Happy Christmas, Aunty Beaty.

41:10.600 --> 41:13.672
I think you're big enough
for just plain Beaty now, don't you?

41:13.760 --> 41:15.990
- Suppose so.
- Here.

41:17.680 --> 41:21.434
Oh... the crown prince, eh?

41:21.960 --> 41:25.475
Well, I'm going to help your mother.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.153
All right, Sandra? Steve?

41:40.240 --> 41:41.229
All right, skinny.

41:42.520 --> 41:45.956
- Where have you been hiding, Blake?
- Just upstairs.

41:46.040 --> 41:49.555
Playing with yourself?
Better give it a rest, Morrison,

41:49.640 --> 41:52.359
- or it'll snap off in your hand.
- I was reading, Steve.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.829
Dostoevsky, actually.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.755
Right, well. See you later then.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.308
Like the hat... Dostoevsky.

42:11.720 --> 42:13.995
Grim, isn't it?

42:14.080 --> 42:15.957
Sodom and Gomorrah.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.309
Is it me, or does it
get worse every year?

42:19.400 --> 42:21.868
It gets worse.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.712
Look at Sandra and Steve.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.799
Disgusting.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.989
You'd think they'd do it outside,
or something. Pig.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.155
There you are. Look, what can it be?

42:52.320 --> 42:54.436
- Gill?
- What?

42:54.520 --> 42:57.239
- You know Josie?
- What about her?

42:58.160 --> 42:59.991
Do you think that?

43:01.720 --> 43:04.792
Do you think that she
looks a bit like us?

43:06.800 --> 43:09.075
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

43:12.240 --> 43:15.516
- It's a little beauty.
- Thank you.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.036
Don't be daft.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.670
One of your migraines?

44:17.360 --> 44:19.476
No.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.232
Just...

44:22.920 --> 44:25.195
Just a headache.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.633
Too much wine at dinner, I think.

44:35.600 --> 44:39.354
Go back to the party. Have some fun.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.631
I'll just...

44:49.200 --> 44:51.919
...go upstairs and lie down for a bit.

44:59.600 --> 45:01.272
God, I wish...

45:01.360 --> 45:03.874
I wish the ground could have
swallowed me up.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.030
We were
just having a bit of fun.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.315
Oh, fun! Is that what you call it?

45:08.400 --> 45:11.517
It's just a dance.
It is Christmas, after all.

45:11.600 --> 45:14.876
What's Christmas
got to do with anything?

45:14.960 --> 45:18.714
- I love you. Come here.
- Get off me! God! God, Arthur!

45:18.800 --> 45:22.156
<i>I found him under our bed,</i>
<i>groping his Christmas presents</i>

45:22.240 --> 45:24.196
<i>He said he was looking for his shoes.</i>

45:24.280 --> 45:27.033
<i>Why they'd be under our bed</i>
<i>he didn't explain.</i>

45:29.360 --> 45:33.433
<i>Anyway, he's in his room now</i>
<i>in disgrace.</i>

45:33.520 --> 45:36.830
<i>I think he's still awake.</i>
<i>Do you want to talk him?</i>

45:36.920 --> 45:38.512
Not right now, no.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.715
- <i>Still there?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

45:50.400 --> 45:51.992
So are you staying on?

45:52.080 --> 45:55.072
- Of course I am.
- <i>And you don't want us to come up?</i>

45:55.160 --> 45:56.798
Not right now.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.996
It's just that I wish...

45:59.080 --> 46:02.516
I wish I could be more involved,
somehow, that's all.

46:02.600 --> 46:05.194
Well, you can't be, I'm sorry.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.952
<i>You sound very distant.</i>

46:14.480 --> 46:15.674
I've got to go.

46:15.760 --> 46:18.194
- You don't want to talk?
- <i>What about?</i>

46:18.280 --> 46:20.191
I don't know...

46:20.280 --> 46:22.589
Things, your father, the situation.

46:22.680 --> 46:25.319
- <i>Why?</i>
- I just thought it might help.

46:26.640 --> 46:30.030
All right then, let's talk about
my father. You first, off you go.

46:31.880 --> 46:35.668
<i>You know, Blake, I know</i>
<i>that you're going through a lot.</i>

46:36.440 --> 46:40.194
That is no excuse
for being a complete bastard.

46:53.240 --> 46:56.152
And the balls. They get trapped.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.630
- How's that?
- Lovely, pet.

47:12.600 --> 47:13.794
Better now?

47:15.720 --> 47:17.950
Much better, pet.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.314
We've been happy, haven't we?

47:30.920 --> 47:32.751
We've got through it.

47:33.400 --> 47:36.756
Lucky man. Lucky man.

47:53.200 --> 47:57.193
- Chelsea versus Middlesbrough?
- Away win.

47:58.120 --> 48:01.795
- Watford versus Southampton?
- Score draw.

48:03.120 --> 48:05.998
Crystal Palace
versus Aston Villa?

48:06.080 --> 48:07.911
No score draw.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.471
- Spurs versus Liverpool?
- Home win.

48:14.240 --> 48:17.232
Your grandpa had a little Austin,

48:17.320 --> 48:20.915
BFX 709, which is
a Blackpool registration.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.879
He bought it in Blackpool, and he was
going to a football match in Bolton,

48:24.960 --> 48:26.996
his team, against Blackpool.

48:27.080 --> 48:29.719
And the queue of traffic was dreadful.

48:29.800 --> 48:32.712
He thought "Bugger this,
I'm gonna go down the outside."

48:32.800 --> 48:35.553
And they were all hooting at him
and shouting at him.

48:35.640 --> 48:39.713
And when he got to the end,
they saw his Blackpool number plate

48:39.800 --> 48:41.916
and took him in the visitors' car park.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.151
So he had watch the whole match
from the wrong end.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.913
He wasn't best pleased.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.590
We've had some fun, haven't we?

48:55.040 --> 48:57.474
It's marvellous having you here.

48:57.560 --> 49:00.233
And Gill and Blake.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.439
If our purpose on this earth is to leave
it a better place for our children,

49:07.520 --> 49:09.715
we haven't done badly, have we?

49:13.520 --> 49:17.399
The shares all go in your mother's name.
The solicitor knows all about it.

49:17.480 --> 49:20.950
Make sure your mother opens
the envelopes and signs all the forms.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.315
And keep an eye on her, won't you?

49:23.400 --> 49:26.915
- Don't disappear and leave it to Gill.
- Of course I won't.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.560
- Tired?
- Too true.

49:35.840 --> 49:39.594
It would be good to talk at some point,
wouldn't it?

49:41.840 --> 49:43.831
When you feel up to it.

49:43.920 --> 49:46.388
- What about?
- Dunno.

49:47.840 --> 49:51.594
Past, I suppose. Family questions.

49:52.320 --> 49:54.550
Sometime. Not today though, eh?

49:55.680 --> 49:57.511
OK.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.157
Not today.

50:03.320 --> 50:04.958
<i>Gentle as you like.</i>

50:06.200 --> 50:09.033
Remember, you're not hitting the ball,
just pushing it.

50:11.320 --> 50:13.993
- Kissing it, really.
- You're doing it on purpose.

50:14.080 --> 50:16.150
- What?
- You know what.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.594
Oh, very good!

50:24.680 --> 50:26.636
Close... yes.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.956
Now...

50:30.040 --> 50:31.792
...Morrison, Senior,

50:31.880 --> 50:35.668
probably the most naturally gifted
golfer of his generation,

50:35.760 --> 50:37.159
addresses the ball.

50:37.240 --> 50:41.233
Slow backswing,
keeping his eye on the ball.

50:42.600 --> 50:44.079
And it's on it's way,

50:44.160 --> 50:46.037
over the humpback bridge,

50:46.120 --> 50:48.509
into the round thing covered in shells,

50:48.600 --> 50:50.636
out the other side...

50:52.720 --> 50:55.632
And it's there!
It's there! Eight under par.

50:55.720 --> 50:58.553
The championship. Well done, Blake.

50:58.640 --> 51:01.359
You did your best,
but at the end of the day,

51:01.440 --> 51:03.749
you were up against a better player.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.637
I enjoyed that.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.837
It would be a lovely hotel to run.

51:23.880 --> 51:26.075
- Do you go camping?
- Oh, here he is.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.674
This is Blake, my eldest.
This is Rachel.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.955
What are you? A blue coat, red coat?

51:31.040 --> 51:34.430
Much posher than that.
I'm your entertainments officer.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.397
Oh, officer!

51:37.360 --> 51:38.713
- Hello.
- Hi.

51:38.800 --> 51:42.190
- He's hoping to go to university too.
- Oh, where to?

51:42.280 --> 51:45.192
Maybe Nottingham, to read English.

51:45.280 --> 51:48.590
Which strikes me as utterly pointless.
Where's the sense in that?

51:48.680 --> 51:51.274
He can already read English
perfectly well as it is.

51:51.360 --> 51:53.112
Arthur, you're such a philistine.

51:53.200 --> 51:55.589
Your glass is empty. What can I get you?

51:55.680 --> 51:57.830
- Technically, I'm on duty.
- A white wine.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.512
Babycham for you, Blake?

52:03.120 --> 52:05.236
Well... we'll just...

52:05.320 --> 52:06.912
We'll just...

52:10.200 --> 52:11.997
Your dad's wonderful.

52:12.080 --> 52:14.594
Yeah, well, you
don't have to live with him.

52:15.160 --> 52:18.311
How about you?
Are you still stuck with your parents?

52:18.400 --> 52:20.550
Actually, my dad's dead.

52:21.720 --> 52:25.110
Heart attack, last year.
That's why I'm here.

52:25.200 --> 52:27.475
My mum thought it
would do me good to get away.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.470
Oh, I'm sorry.

52:31.600 --> 52:32.919
- Were you close?
- Yes.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.514
- Yeah?
- Yes, very.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.873
I must just go and say hello.

52:44.480 --> 52:47.199
"Actually, my dad's dead!"
Nice one.

52:47.280 --> 52:49.589
Here you are. Scared her off, have you?

52:49.680 --> 52:51.910
Looks like it, Dad.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.752
I'll just take her this.

52:56.240 --> 52:59.038
- Your wine, madam.
- Thank you very much.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.635
Hey, what are you up to?

53:12.720 --> 53:14.870
Just reading.

53:14.960 --> 53:17.952
You ought to be careful.
You'll go blind.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.832
From reading in the dark, I mean.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.035
That's better.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.951
Why can't you just share with mum?

53:26.040 --> 53:28.793
It's more fun like this, chaps together.

53:28.880 --> 53:31.030
We can have a laugh, can't we?

53:47.240 --> 53:48.878
Oh, sorry.

53:48.960 --> 53:51.520
- I woke you.
- It's all right.

53:56.440 --> 53:58.078
How did you put up with it, Mum?

53:58.160 --> 53:59.957
With what?

54:02.640 --> 54:04.790
I don't know.

54:04.880 --> 54:08.350
All that noise and the bluster
and the scams and the...

54:09.120 --> 54:11.031
...Beaty being around all the time.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.839
I just sometimes wonder, how you...

54:13.920 --> 54:15.956
...put up with it all these years.

54:16.040 --> 54:18.076
Well, I didn't.

54:19.400 --> 54:21.038
Not always.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.675
Dad's very groggy again.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.997
I thought he was better.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.230
We were chatting and he seemed better.

54:31.320 --> 54:34.630
Well, that's all over now.

54:35.840 --> 54:38.559
He's been having faecal vomiting.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.749
I'm gonna have to change
the sheets, Blake.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.870
I think I'm gonna need
a hand moving him.

54:46.440 --> 54:47.714
Are you up to it?

54:54.440 --> 54:55.793
Up.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.155
Oh, blimey, Dad!
What have you been eating?

55:16.400 --> 55:19.836
I think I'm gonna need you
to get him in the chair, Blake.

55:19.920 --> 55:22.388
I'm just gonna get you up now.
Come on.

55:24.440 --> 55:27.113
- Chair! Chair!
- It's all right, Dad. I've got you.

55:27.200 --> 55:29.873
I won't let go. You're all right, Dad.

55:29.960 --> 55:32.918
There you go. Safe now.

55:34.600 --> 55:38.070
It's all right. It's all right.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.071
I told you, didn't I?

55:46.200 --> 55:47.872
You should have seen Blake,

55:47.960 --> 55:51.794
sloshing around in the freezing
cold water in his underpants.

55:52.720 --> 55:55.188
You weren't a happy camper,
were you, Blake?

55:55.280 --> 55:56.838
No, Dad.

55:57.600 --> 56:01.479
Excuse me for a moment, Rachel.
I have to see a man about a dog.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.071
You're very lucky, you know?

56:07.160 --> 56:09.754
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm very lucky.

56:11.720 --> 56:14.632
Do you know what he calls my mother?

56:14.720 --> 56:16.631
"Mummy."

56:16.720 --> 56:20.633
I mean, what kind of a man
calls his wife "Mummy"?

56:20.720 --> 56:24.156
- I think it's nice.
- I think it's creepy.

56:24.240 --> 56:26.310
He's like a big kid.

56:27.400 --> 56:31.359
He's never read a single book
all the way through.

56:31.440 --> 56:35.797
As far as I can tell, he's been reading
<i>Death on the Nile</i> for the last 42 years.

56:35.880 --> 56:38.758
There are more important things
in life than books.

56:38.840 --> 56:42.150
Are there? I don't think so.

56:43.240 --> 56:46.038
I think books are everything.

56:46.120 --> 56:47.997
You want to be a writer?

56:48.080 --> 56:50.753
Maybe... Ideally, I'd...

56:50.840 --> 56:54.594
- Am I missing anything?
- It's all right. Doesn't matter.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.797
It's not important.

56:57.320 --> 57:00.073
Will you excuse me?
I need to see a man about a dog.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.518
I hate...

57:11.600 --> 57:14.717
I fucking, fucking, fucking...

57:15.840 --> 57:17.796
...hate him.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.438
Just a few words, if I may?

57:21.520 --> 57:24.478
As you know, the Morrisons
are leaving tomorrow,

57:24.560 --> 57:28.997
so I'd like to take this opportunity
to say how marvellous it has been

57:29.080 --> 57:33.517
to meet you all and say a very special
thank-you to the lovely Rachel Stein,

57:33.600 --> 57:37.593
who's made it such a memorable holiday,
especially for my lad, Blake.

57:38.880 --> 57:42.395
So... raise your glasses
if you would, please,

57:42.480 --> 57:44.550
and drain them, doctor's orders,

57:44.640 --> 57:47.791
as we say a special toast
to newfound friends.

57:47.880 --> 57:49.518
Newfound friends.

58:01.080 --> 58:04.436
Blake! April fool.

58:18.840 --> 58:20.478
It was just a joke.

58:21.120 --> 58:25.636
Blake! Blake!
Come back! Don't be like that.

58:25.720 --> 58:28.598
Come and have a drink.
It was just a bit of fun.

58:28.680 --> 58:31.638
Yeah, for you and your girlfriend,
maybe.

58:31.720 --> 58:34.188
Honestly, an old man like you?

58:34.280 --> 58:37.636
It's pathetic. You'd think Beaty
would be enough for you.

58:37.720 --> 58:38.789
I beg your pardon?

58:38.880 --> 58:41.553
I'm surprised you didn't
ask her along on holiday.

58:41.640 --> 58:44.234
- She goes every where else with us.
- Enough, Blake.

58:44.320 --> 58:46.880
- I'm sure Mummy wouldn't mind.
- Blake.

58:46.960 --> 58:49.349
And even if she does mind,
what do you care?

58:49.440 --> 58:52.193
- "It's just a bit of fun."
- I said that's enough!

58:53.400 --> 58:55.550
I love your mother very much.

58:56.280 --> 58:58.236
I love all of you.

58:59.080 --> 59:01.958
You mean the whole world to me.
You know that.

59:02.040 --> 59:05.157
So why'd you do it, Dad? Why?

59:05.240 --> 59:07.276
I don't know what
you're talking about.

59:07.360 --> 59:09.635
Now come inside.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.672
Hello, stranger.

59:47.760 --> 59:50.274
So, what was it like then?

59:50.360 --> 59:53.909
- All right for some.
- Meet nice girls when you were away?

59:54.000 --> 59:56.150
Any holiday romance?

59:56.240 --> 59:59.550
- Only for Dad.
- I just hope you weren't unfaithful.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.791
If I found out you been seeing someone
else behind my back...

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.598
Blake, get off.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.399
Blake?

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.994
Blake?

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.877
Won't be a minute.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.796
He was trying to get up
to clear his lungs and...

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.996
And he was coughing a lot

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.799
and panicking,
so I gave him some morphine.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.194
He... all he said was,
"Can I lie down now?"

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.389
He's better now, but...

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.550
...his breathing's very irregular.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.711
What's he looking at?

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.473
Nothing.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.038
Dad?

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.470
He's looking straight through me.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.392
<i>Please, Dad, stop breathing.</i>
<i>Please just stop.</i>

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.113
<i>If you can't come back</i>
<i>as you were, then go.</i>

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.957
Thank God.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.678
I thought he'd gone then.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.999
Don't do that again. Silly old bugger.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.039
- <i>I hate him.</i>
- <i>Don't be daft.</i>

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.635
- No one hates their dad, not really.
- Well, I do.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.237
All I mean is...

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.154
...if there's a firing squad and
I had to choose between shooting you

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.912
or shooting my dad,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.116
then I'd shoot my dad, that's all.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.190
- What was that for? What?
- You know what.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.874
- Don't you dare.
- I was trying to be nice...

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.315
Well it's not nice.
It's a wicked thing to say.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.233
Don't you dare ever, ever say anything
like that again.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.958
- Why not?
- It doesn't matter.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.237
I wouldn't say that about my dad,
and he's a vicious bastard.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.471
- All I meant...
- You should never wish anyone dead.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.391
What if it came true?

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.477
- Blake? Blake, where are you?
- Sex police! Go!

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.990
- Arthur!
- Sandra! Sorry.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.638
Why don't you knock?

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.438
You frightened the life out of me!

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.080
I didn't think you'd be in, sorry.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.789
I was just looking
for Blake, that's all.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.075
Oh, well, he's hardly likely to be here.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.311
No, I suppose not.
But tell him...

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.598
Tell Blake I was looking for him. Sorry.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.755
It's ten minutes now.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.596
I think he's gone, Blake.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.513
Should I cover his face?

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.318
No.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.959
You'll be all right here?

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.350
Yeah, I thought I might just lie down
with him for a bit.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.271
Do you think?

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.477
- Do you think that's all right?
- I'm sure it is.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.159
Mom.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.511
Mom?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.831
The undertaker's here.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.989
What?

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.514
The undertaker's here.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.915
He's still warm.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.434
That's why we like
to get in pretty sharpish,

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.274
before the rigor mortis. After 12 hours,
they get stiff as a board.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.031
Hello, what's this?

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.269
Pacemaker.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.954
- Cremation is it?
- I think so, yes.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.918
Well, I'll have to remove that
I'm afraid.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.719
Otherwise they explode.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.155
I'll... I'll make a note of it.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.153
<i>Boom-boom. Boom-boom.</i>
<i>Boom-boom. Boom-boom.</i>

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.471
<i>Can you hear it?</i>

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.876
<i>Pumping away?</i>

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.068
I was just passing, so I thought...

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.754
Not exactly
on your way home, though, is it?

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.910
Nope.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.718
Poor old King Arthur.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.429
Lent me the money for this house,
you know?

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.994
I won't half miss him.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.310
You know, I used to think
you fancied him.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.319
But I was shagging you.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.515
I thought you were
with him on the sly.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:20.229
Christ, Blake. What did you take me for?

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.794
Remember how he was always
trying to catch us?

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.678
Sex police? Never did though, did he?

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:28.839
Too fast for him.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:31.354
He used to say,

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.716
"Leave two blokes in a room
long enough, they'll kill each other.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.598
Leave a man and a woman,
and they'll screw each other."

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.078
Is that right?

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.113
You were my first love,
you know that, don't you?

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.038
Yeah, well...

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.996
...life's easier without.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.152
It's funny, though, isn't it?

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.712
You and me. Alone together again.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.711
I mean, he's not here to walk in on us.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.676
Blake.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.318
It's all right. Look at you.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.995
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.517
Hey, you want to see something?

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:46.158
- It's his pacemaker.
- Bloody hell, Blake!

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.595
The undertaker cut it out of his chest
with a scalpel.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.875
I washed it.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.269
Did you see him cut it out?

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.634
Nope.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.677
I wanted to, though.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.230
I wanted to see if I could take it,
watching him being cut open.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.359
See if I could have been
a doctor too, I suppose.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.595
- You think I've gone nuts, don't you?
- Yeah.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.190
But then you always were
a wee bit nuts.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.756
I'm back.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.908
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.391
Oh, God, it's good to see you.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.831
I'm so sorry.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.476
I'm sorry.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.835
This isn't working, is it?

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.316
It's OK.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.155
You just lie still.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.515
How are you feeling?

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.396
I don't know.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.192
Cheated.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.709
- Do you want to go into the car?
- Yes, come on.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.832
- Oh, where'd you get that from?
- Dad's wardrobe.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.674
- A bit loose around the belly.
- No, no, it's not that loose.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.795
- You don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.633
No, I'm sure he'd be delighted.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.392
What's up?

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.079
Come on, you're meant to be bartending.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.594
- I still can't see it.
- See what?

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.557
The resemblance.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.791
Oh, for Christ's sake, Blake,
why can't you just let it go?

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.189
It's history.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.031
Would you like a drink,
Aunty Beaty?

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.510
Oh, I don't think anyone's called me
"Aunty" in 20 years.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.352
Look at you, Blake.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.149
Goodness. Well, you look just like him.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:04.152
I think Gill needs a hand, Mum.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.356
Does she?

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.228
- All right, dear.
- You sound just like him too.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.073
- Beaty, can I have a word?
- Yes, of course.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.355
In private.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.831
The thing is, I do know something
went on between you and Dad.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.990
- I see.
- I know it was a long time ago.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.833
I'm not angry.
I mean, I was angry.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.429
For years, furious
with him mainly, but...

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.112
But I'm not anymore.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.156
At least I don't think so.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.473
But I would like to know the truth.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.279
I need to know the truth.
I think I'll go mad otherwise.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.669
You can't understand that, can you?

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.752
Well, yes. Yes, I suppose so.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.796
Well, mine was never a very happy
marriage, Blake. And Arthur...

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.634
...patron saint of lost causes,
he saw that and he...

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.870
...consoled me, I suppose.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.154
I was lonely, and he made me laugh.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.840
I wouldn't have got
through the days without him.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.400
It was consolation, Blake.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.233
- But was it physical?
- Is that important?

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.151
Yes, I think it is.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.750
Leave me something
of him please, Blake. It is mine.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.230
Whatever sadness,

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.476
whatever hurt we caused you,
I am sorry for.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.595
All I will say is this:

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.436
Arthur loved your mother more than
any human being on the whole earth.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.636
And you too. You and Gill.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.709
And he was proud of you.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.233
So, so proud.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.073
Even if he didn't always show it.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.031
But what about Josie?

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.638
Do I have a sister?

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.630
Oh, there you are.
The taxi's been waiting, Mum.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.029
- Sorry.
- We've got to go.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.993
I'm gonna miss him so much.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.232
Goodbye.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.678
<i>Blake!</i>

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.552
- Sure you don't want me to drive you?
- No, Dad.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.835
I can run you to the station
in ten minutes.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.115
I prefer this way really.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.030
How far are your digs at the other end?

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.951
Couple of miles.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.398
- How you going to get there?
- I don't know.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.677
- Bus, I suppose.
- Bus? With all this stuff?

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.115
- Or taxi.
- Oh, a taxi!

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.350
- Is that right, moneybags?
- Dad.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.910
Once your allowance is gone, that's it.
Don't come running cap in hand.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.798
- Doesn't grow on trees.
- Doesn't grow on trees. I know.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.310
You're studying a proper subject,

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.868
like medicine or science,
guarantee you a job.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.076
Dad, please.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.075
Right then.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.391
See you then.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.277
See you, Dad.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.358
TTFM.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.191
I'll miss you.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.309
You too, Dad.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.912
Dad.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.596
<i>When did you last</i>
<i>see your father?</i>

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.433
<i>Was it when they burnt the coffin?</i>

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.192
<i>Put the lid on it?</i>

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.391
<i>When he exhaled his last breath?</i>

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.191
<i>When he sat up</i>
<i>and said something?</i>

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.078
<i>When he last recognized you?</i>

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.552
<i>When he last smiled?</i>

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.590
<i>When did you last see your father?</i>

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.670
<i>The last time he was healthy, active?</i>

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.951
<i>The last time you had</i>
<i>an argument about something?</i>

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.712
Dear old Dad.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.915
Want to keep this,
in case it comes in useful?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:44.989
No.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.991
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.310
Dad would have done, you know?

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.595
<i>Those weeks</i>
<i>we tried to say goodbye</i>

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.557
<i>were like a series of depletions.</i>

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:58.950
<i>Each day I thought, "He can't get</i>
<i>less like himself than this. "</i>

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.471
<i>Yet each day he did.</i>

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:06.029
<i>So I've been trying to recall</i>
<i>the last time I actually saw him.</i>

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.112
<i>The last time he was unmistakably there,</i>

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.837
<i>in the fullness of being...</i>

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.399
<i>... him.</i>

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:27.552
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing it as fast as I can.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:29.790
- You using a Phillips screwdriver?
- No.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.836
- No wonder you can't do it.
- I can do it.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.638
- Doesn't look like it.
- Dad.

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.154
- Are you sure it's gonna hold?
- Absolutely.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.470
Right, let's see.
Ready to let go?

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.073
Absolutely.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.559
Gently does it.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.235
- There.
- Told you, didn't I?

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.471
Moment of truth.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.797
Let there be light.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.950
Right. What's next then?
