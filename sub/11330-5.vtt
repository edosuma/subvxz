WEBVTT

00:03.539 --> 00:06.607
I don't want to be married.
I don't have to be married,

00:06.618 --> 00:08.986
You are not going to leave Adrian.
I'm not gonna let you.

00:09.021 --> 00:10.822
I think maybe I should
do what you did

00:10.856 --> 00:12.924
and just tell Ben I'm
thinking about going away.

00:12.958 --> 00:13.991
What?

00:14.026 --> 00:16.603
To New York.
To cosmetology school.

00:16.637 --> 00:18.106
The best way for you to learn
something is to get a job.

00:18.141 --> 00:20.777
You agreed to put money
into my account every week.

00:20.811 --> 00:22.844
Yeah, that's when I thought
you were seeing America.

00:22.879 --> 00:24.956
Daniel, do you think our
relationship is gonna last?

00:24.991 --> 00:28.020
I think it's a little too early for
us to be making any plans together.

00:28.054 --> 00:29.656
I want to go to
cosmetology school.

00:29.690 --> 00:30.960
I'm totally for it.

00:30.994 --> 00:33.971
What if I would need to go
to New York to study?

00:34.006 --> 00:35.038
That'd be great.

00:35.072 --> 00:36.839
And you're thinking
if Grace dropped Grant,

00:36.874 --> 00:38.677
then she'll drop
this guy too.

00:38.711 --> 00:40.713
And then finally, at long
last, she'll be free

00:40.748 --> 00:41.881
and you'll be in
the house with her.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.787
But I don't want
to be with Grace.

00:43.821 --> 00:45.055
Maybe we just need
a bigger place.

00:45.089 --> 00:46.924
Maybe we just need to
move back to my house.

00:46.958 --> 00:48.861
The three of us?
No, John and me.

00:48.896 --> 00:51.900
So what's the story?
What's your way out that was her idea?

00:51.934 --> 00:55.003
She could possibly go to
cosmetology school in New York.

00:55.037 --> 00:57.773
No. This is a lie.
I'm not buying it.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.777
Is it too soon for me to
try to get pregnant again?

01:19.770 --> 01:23.808
Good morning.
Daddy!

01:23.842 --> 01:26.810
What time is it?
6:30.

01:26.845 --> 01:28.745
Do we have to get up?

01:28.780 --> 01:31.014
Yeah, we do.
What's John doing in here?

01:31.048 --> 01:34.149
He came in in the middle of the night.
Isn't that cute?

01:34.183 --> 01:36.751
Not really, no.
I'm sleeping on the couch

01:36.785 --> 01:39.086
so I can keep an eye on him and
he's in here sleeping with you.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.988
Wants to be with his
mommy, don't you, John?

01:41.022 --> 01:42.922
Yeah, well, Daddy wants
to be with his mommy.

01:42.956 --> 01:46.891
Oh, come on, you can be
with me any time you want.

01:46.926 --> 01:49.761
Hmm, I think we have to
do something about this.

01:49.795 --> 01:50.963
About the sleeping
arrangements.

01:50.997 --> 01:52.164
Okay, what do you wanna do?

01:52.198 --> 01:54.834
I wanna put his bed in here
and our bed out there.

01:54.868 --> 01:56.869
Our bed in the living room
like I suggested before?

01:56.903 --> 01:59.806
Yeah. Or get a couch
that pulls out or something.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.943
All right, well...

02:02.977 --> 02:04.845
If that's what you want
to do, then let's do it.

02:04.879 --> 02:07.047
That's what I wanna do. And I wanna
get all the toys and the baby stuff

02:07.081 --> 02:09.683
into this room, keep it
out of the living room.

02:09.717 --> 02:11.684
Okay, that sounds
like a good idea, too.

02:11.719 --> 02:14.755
He has too much stuff. We need to
either get rid of some of his toys

02:14.789 --> 02:16.957
and things or find some
better way to store them.

02:16.991 --> 02:18.892
Okay.

02:18.926 --> 02:20.826
I've been leaving most of his
toys at my parents' house

02:20.861 --> 02:22.127
and then swapping them out.

02:22.162 --> 02:23.929
But...

02:23.963 --> 02:26.698
I'll take some of what I brought
over here this weekend back.

02:26.732 --> 02:30.001
Really, I like to keep everything
kind of clean and organized.

02:30.035 --> 02:32.003
Okay.
So...

02:32.037 --> 02:34.840
So, it's 6:30 in the morning. Just give
me a few minutes to wake up, Ricky,

02:34.874 --> 02:36.107
and then I'll get right on it.

02:36.142 --> 02:38.142
I just don't like him sleeping
in here and me in there.

02:38.177 --> 02:40.678
Yeah, I got that.

02:40.712 --> 02:44.114
Ricky, do you need
a little space,

02:44.148 --> 02:45.916
some time for yourself?

02:45.950 --> 02:48.018
Want me to go over to my
dad's tonight and do laundry

02:48.052 --> 02:50.753
and then just fall asleep over there
and then you can have your apartment

02:50.788 --> 02:53.055
just for you for the night?
I don't mind doing that if you want.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.893
No, I don't want... I just want us
to make this work, all right?

02:56.928 --> 03:00.964
For the most part it's working,
but this, this is not working.

03:05.003 --> 03:07.972
Someone's not in a good
mood this morning.

03:08.006 --> 03:10.975
I heard that.
I meant for you to hear that.

03:12.711 --> 03:14.913
I love you.

03:16.983 --> 03:18.817
I'm sorry.
Me, too.

03:18.852 --> 03:20.920
I love you.
It's just that...

03:20.954 --> 03:23.857
It's just that you're not
in a good mood this morning,

03:23.891 --> 03:25.792
so you're annoyed with me
whether you love me or not.

03:25.826 --> 03:28.028
You know I love you, Amy.

03:28.062 --> 03:31.665
Did something else happen other than
I let John come in here to sleep?

03:31.699 --> 03:35.101
Um, no. Not really.

03:35.136 --> 03:37.037
Adrian?
Adrian?

03:37.071 --> 03:40.006
I don't buy that whole story of
her going to cosmetology school.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.141
I think she's just looking
to get out of the marriage.

03:42.176 --> 03:45.010
And if she's looking to get
out of the marriage, then...

03:45.045 --> 03:47.679
Did she call you
or anything?

03:47.714 --> 03:48.747
Why would she call me?

03:48.781 --> 03:50.716
I don't know, did she?

03:50.750 --> 03:52.985
I hit "ignore."
I didn't talk to her.

03:53.020 --> 03:55.855
Okay, well, now I'm not
in a good mood, either.

04:53.722 --> 04:56.691
Hi. Good morning, husband.

04:56.726 --> 04:57.859
Uh, do you want me to
make you some breakfast?

04:57.894 --> 05:00.595
No, I'm going to head out,
if you don't need me here.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.931
No, I don't need you here.
I'm okay.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.435
I'm feeling better.

05:06.469 --> 05:07.903
Okay.

05:10.507 --> 05:14.577
Do you really need to do this?

05:14.611 --> 05:15.711
To sit in this room?

05:15.745 --> 05:17.479
Does it make you sad
to be in this room?

05:17.513 --> 05:18.780
I don't come in this room.

05:18.814 --> 05:22.583
It made me
really sad at first,

05:22.618 --> 05:26.453
but now I find it
kind of comforting.

05:26.488 --> 05:28.588
Comforting how?
I don't know.

05:30.524 --> 05:33.560
I guess I'm coming
to accept that...

05:33.594 --> 05:36.463
Mercy was just not
meant to be here,

05:36.497 --> 05:39.800
for reasons
we'll never know,

05:40.968 --> 05:43.670
and we have to go on
with our lives.

05:43.705 --> 05:46.540
You're still thinking about
going away to school?

05:46.574 --> 05:48.609
Yeah.

05:48.643 --> 05:51.912
Are you still thinking that it would
be okay for me to go away to school?

05:53.882 --> 05:55.515
You wouldn't mind if
I left for a while?

05:55.550 --> 05:58.685
No. Not if that's
what you want to do.

05:58.719 --> 06:00.786
If that's what
you need to do.

06:04.924 --> 06:09.827
I went for a walk this morning.
A long walk.

06:09.862 --> 06:13.564
And I'm going to start
walking every morning.

06:14.734 --> 06:18.436
I'm going to get myself together.
It's time.

06:18.471 --> 06:21.707
I'm sure it's not
gonna be easy, but...

06:21.741 --> 06:23.609
I'm gonna do it.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.479
I'm really happy
to hear you say that.

06:51.704 --> 06:53.905
Morning, best friends
of Adrian.

06:53.939 --> 06:56.808
And I'm sure I know what
you're talking about. Adrian.

06:56.843 --> 06:58.644
Yeah, we were.

06:58.678 --> 07:00.880
I'm surprised that she wants
to go to cosmetology school

07:00.914 --> 07:03.483
or that she'd think about
leaving you to go to New York.

07:03.517 --> 07:06.553
Why? You left me and went to New York.
Why shouldn't Adrian?

07:06.587 --> 07:09.556
That was different. How was that different?
You went for you,

07:09.590 --> 07:10.724
and she's going for her.

07:10.758 --> 07:13.527
Ben, you told Adrian
to go to New York?

07:13.561 --> 07:14.695
You told her
that was okay?

07:14.729 --> 07:16.630
Why not? It's better than
sitting at home, right?

07:16.664 --> 07:18.832
Well, don't you think it would be better
for her to come back to school here

07:18.866 --> 07:20.867
and finish high school
before she does anything else?

07:20.902 --> 07:24.505
No. I do not. She does not want
to come back to high school here.

07:24.539 --> 07:27.641
She said that over and over and
over again and I finally heard her.

07:27.676 --> 07:29.910
I'm sure it wouldn't be easy,
but I think she can do it.

07:29.945 --> 07:31.845
I'm sure she can do it.
She needs to do it.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.448
She needs to finish high school
before she can do anything else.

07:34.482 --> 07:38.785
Look, neither of you should discourage
her from going to cosmetology school.

07:38.820 --> 07:43.557
In fact, I want both of you to
promise you won't discourage her.

07:43.592 --> 07:44.591
Promise.

07:44.626 --> 07:46.626
Okay, I promise.

07:46.661 --> 07:48.495
I don't promise.

07:48.529 --> 07:50.963
Thank you, Grace.
I knew I could count on you.

07:55.769 --> 07:57.469
Why would you make
a promise like that?

07:57.503 --> 07:58.804
It wasn't a real promise.

07:58.838 --> 08:01.639
You said you promise.
How is that not a real promise? You lied?

08:01.674 --> 08:03.475
This whole thing is a lie.

08:03.509 --> 08:06.578
Adrian just said to Ben that she
wanted to go to cosmetology school

08:06.612 --> 08:08.847
to see if he would tell
her to go. It was a test.

08:08.881 --> 08:11.516
And he failed.
He told her to go.

08:11.551 --> 08:13.585
Which means
he wants her to go.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.722
He wants her to leave. He wants out.
I mean, she must be heartbroken.

08:16.756 --> 08:19.424
Or she must be very angry.

08:19.459 --> 08:20.626
And you know how she is
when she's angry.

08:20.660 --> 08:21.660
Yeah.

08:21.694 --> 08:23.695
She called Ricky.
What?

08:23.729 --> 08:25.830
Yeah, I knew that she would,
sooner or later.

08:25.865 --> 08:27.465
What did she want?
I don't know.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.900
But I think we can both
make a good guess.

08:36.476 --> 08:39.510
Hello. Yeah. Hi, Adrian.

08:39.546 --> 08:42.448
I want you to know that
I called Ricky.

08:42.482 --> 08:43.849
Yeah, he already told me.

08:43.883 --> 08:47.820
Oh, okay. Good.
Um, it's not that big of a deal.

08:47.854 --> 08:51.657
I just, I didn't talk
to him in a long time.

08:51.691 --> 08:53.859
And, well, for the record,
he never called me back.

08:53.893 --> 08:58.596
He can call you back if he wants. I don't
care if the two of you talk to each other.

08:58.630 --> 09:03.834
Good. I just... I wanna start
getting things back to normal.

09:03.869 --> 09:07.638
Well, I'm ready to start trying
getting things back to normal anyway.

09:07.672 --> 09:12.609
So, um, look,

09:12.644 --> 09:15.646
I need you and Grace to help me
with something. What's that?

09:15.681 --> 09:17.882
I need you to help me get rid
of everything in this nursery.

09:17.916 --> 09:22.754
It's making me depressed and
Ben depressed and... Well, it's time.

09:22.789 --> 09:24.723
What do you wanna do
with all that stuff?

09:24.758 --> 09:26.792
I don't know.
You got any ideas?

09:26.827 --> 09:29.662
Well, I mean, I'm sure that the church
nursery would appreciate anything

09:29.697 --> 09:31.631
that you would want
to give to them.

09:31.665 --> 09:33.866
Okay. Yeah, they can have it all.
I really don't care.

09:33.901 --> 09:36.636
Just as long as it
goes to good use.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.437
Can you guys do this today?

09:38.472 --> 09:41.808
I really wanna get rid of this stuff
today or I might lose my nerve.

09:41.842 --> 09:44.476
Don't get rid of anything unless
you are absolutely certain that

09:44.511 --> 09:46.478
that's what you wanna do.

09:46.513 --> 09:47.679
And maybe you ought to think
about it for a few more days.

09:47.714 --> 09:49.548
No, I want to do it today.

09:49.582 --> 09:52.851
Okay, well, um, we'll figure it
out and then we'll call you back.

09:52.886 --> 09:54.787
And is Ben is okay with this?

09:54.821 --> 09:56.889
Ben would have done this before
I came home from the hospital,

09:56.924 --> 09:58.792
but I wouldn't let him.

09:58.826 --> 10:00.560
So, yeah, he's fine with it.

10:00.594 --> 10:01.761
Okay.

10:01.796 --> 10:04.631
Well, if you want our help,
Adrian, then you've got it.

10:04.665 --> 10:05.900
Thanks, Amy.

10:15.780 --> 10:18.616
Good morning, sir.
Good morning to you.

10:20.761 --> 10:24.597
Here's your coffee, black, and
the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>

10:24.631 --> 10:29.635
All articles pertaining to anything
meat-related have been highlighted.

10:29.669 --> 10:32.705
Oh, thank you, Nora.
That's very nice of you.

10:32.739 --> 10:35.507
But what are you doing here?
How come you're not at the butcher shop?

10:35.542 --> 10:38.710
Oh, um, whoever is running your
human resources department

10:38.744 --> 10:41.479
called Bunny and said they've
run out of resources.

10:41.513 --> 10:42.947
They wanted Bunny,
she sent me.

10:42.981 --> 10:45.950
Fine. I don't know why everybody
thinks I'm so difficult to work for.

10:45.985 --> 10:47.886
Apparently,
you scare people.

10:47.920 --> 10:48.954
Scare people how?

10:48.988 --> 10:51.490
I don't know.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.526
I heard you're a screamer.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.728
Once in a while,
I might raise my voice.

10:55.763 --> 10:57.931
People just have to
do their job, that's all.

10:57.965 --> 11:00.534
We're making sausage,
we're not making lollipops.

11:00.568 --> 11:02.469
Hey, I get it.
I totally get it.

11:02.504 --> 11:07.775
Oh, one question.
How do you make that sausage?

11:07.810 --> 11:09.844
I think you're the first
person who's been at that desk

11:09.878 --> 11:11.546
who's asked me
that question.

11:11.580 --> 11:14.549
Other than Camille.
And that was a long, long time ago.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.617
You really want to know?
Yeah, I've been thinking about it.

11:16.652 --> 11:18.586
Wondering how you
got to be the king.

11:18.621 --> 11:20.722
If I didn't know you better, I'd
say you were hitting on me.

11:20.757 --> 11:22.591
No, I'm really interested.

11:22.625 --> 11:26.528
First call of the day.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.863
Good morning, you've reached
Boykewich Headquarters.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.666
How may I help you?

11:31.701 --> 11:33.901
Hey, Ben. It's me.
"Me," who?

11:33.936 --> 11:36.504
Me, Ricky's mom, Nora.

11:36.539 --> 11:39.574
Oh, jeez, my dad's got you
working for him today?

11:39.608 --> 11:41.709
Honored to be here.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.545
Hey, I take it you're
looking for him?

11:43.580 --> 11:45.647
Yeah, I am.

11:45.982 --> 11:47.650
Uh, he just...

11:47.684 --> 11:48.751
Stepped into a meeting.

11:48.785 --> 11:50.920
...stepped into a meeting.

11:53.623 --> 11:56.525
<i>Oh, I'm getting the "stepped
into a meeting" runaround, huh?</i>

11:56.560 --> 11:59.495
Just tell him that I can't
make it for dinner tonight.

11:59.529 --> 12:01.797
And why not? Oh, I thought you
just stepped into a meeting.

12:01.832 --> 12:03.866
I want to talk to you.
I have a paper due tomorrow.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.435
Then you better
get started on it

12:06.469 --> 12:08.737
'cause you're meeting me for dinner
and don't be trying to back out.

12:08.772 --> 12:11.640
I want to talk to you.
Betty told me about Adrian.

12:11.675 --> 12:14.609
You are not shipping
her off to New York.

12:17.913 --> 12:19.447
Hi.

12:19.482 --> 12:21.483
Yeah. Hi.

12:21.517 --> 12:22.550
Shouldn't you be in class?

12:22.585 --> 12:25.754
I was just, uh,
checking on things.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.623
Things or people?
Adrian?

12:28.658 --> 12:30.559
My dad.

12:30.593 --> 12:33.528
My dad's been having a tough time.
You saw him when he was here.

12:33.563 --> 12:35.864
So I just felt like
I needed to call him.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.768
And how are you?

12:39.802 --> 12:42.671
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.508
Better get back to class.

12:46.542 --> 12:49.677
Um, I was hoping to talk to you about
a rumor that's going around school.

12:49.712 --> 12:51.713
I don't want to talk
about any rumors.

12:51.747 --> 12:53.582
And whatever they are,
they're probably not true.

12:53.616 --> 12:56.818
Yeah. Ben, look, there are only a
couple of months of school left.

12:56.852 --> 13:00.555
And I know you've been
through a horrible time.

13:00.589 --> 13:02.624
But I also know that
you're an honorable man,

13:02.658 --> 13:04.459
and you don't want to
do anything dishonorable.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.494
This is none of your business.

13:06.529 --> 13:08.563
Excuse me?
None of your business.

13:08.597 --> 13:10.865
This is personal.
You're my business.

13:10.899 --> 13:12.834
You're a student here
and so is Adrian.

13:12.868 --> 13:15.636
No. No, she's not.
She was a student here.

13:15.671 --> 13:19.807
She's not a student here anymore. And she's
not gonna come back to school here.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.610
And whatever Adrian
decides is her business,

13:22.644 --> 13:23.744
not your business.

13:23.778 --> 13:26.480
Look, Ben, I really care
about the students here.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.682
And I especially care
about you and Adrian.

13:28.716 --> 13:31.718
Well, don't.
Who asked you to?

13:31.752 --> 13:35.588
No one asked me to.
It's just that...

13:35.622 --> 13:38.591
This is my first job
back after...

13:40.694 --> 13:42.728
After I lost a baby.

13:43.931 --> 13:45.765
So, yeah, you know what,
maybe I have

13:45.799 --> 13:48.936
crossed some line here
without realizing it.

13:48.970 --> 13:51.772
May be this has become
too personal.

13:56.545 --> 13:57.879
It's been two years

13:57.914 --> 14:02.551
for me and I'm still having a
difficult time with the loss.

14:04.554 --> 14:05.854
SIDS.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.524
My baby died of SIDS.

14:09.559 --> 14:12.727
And then my husband left me
18 months later.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.568
18 months?
Yeah.

14:21.603 --> 14:24.772
I was the one who was
inconsolable at first.

14:24.806 --> 14:28.543
Then I was depressed
for almost a year,

14:28.577 --> 14:32.713
and then when I finally got
myself together, he fell apart.

14:32.748 --> 14:35.783
And his way of dealing with it
was staying drunk all the time.

14:35.818 --> 14:38.887
Well, I've dealt
with it. Sober.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.458
And Adrian can't deal with it. And maybe
she needs to go to cosmetology school

14:42.492 --> 14:47.529
to start dealing with it.
So, please, just stay out of it.

14:47.564 --> 14:49.631
Are you sure
you're okay, Ben?

14:49.665 --> 14:54.502
Because this doesn't seem
like you, to encourage Adrian

14:54.536 --> 14:56.737
to do the wrong thing and to
go away and study something

14:56.771 --> 14:58.572
that she's never been
interested in before

14:58.606 --> 15:00.607
just so you can
get out of your marriage.

15:00.641 --> 15:03.643
Get out of my marriage? Who said anything
about getting out of my marriage?

15:03.677 --> 15:06.545
Why else would you encourage
her to do something like this?

15:06.580 --> 15:09.816
I mean, Adrian is smart enough to
finish high school and to go to college

15:09.850 --> 15:12.886
and get into law school. If her husband
doesn't take away her courage

15:12.920 --> 15:14.821
and her strength
and her determination.

15:14.855 --> 15:18.424
I didn't take those away things
from her, losing the baby did.

15:21.461 --> 15:23.462
Are you done now?
Finished.

15:23.497 --> 15:26.532
I'm finished now. Yes.

15:36.776 --> 15:38.577
Does the whole school
know that Adrian

15:38.611 --> 15:40.579
wants to further
her education in New York?

15:40.613 --> 15:43.749
Now that's a positive spin on
things if I've ever heard one.

15:43.783 --> 15:45.550
And the answer to your
question is yes.

15:45.584 --> 15:46.985
Oh, uh,

15:47.019 --> 15:49.622
I guess that enough time has passed
that I can, I can tell you this.

15:49.656 --> 15:52.491
Half the student body thinks you're
pushing Adrian out the door,

15:52.525 --> 15:53.759
the other half thinks
you're running,

15:53.793 --> 15:56.795
so it's evenly divided
between jerk and coward.

15:56.830 --> 16:00.699
So I think that the only way your
reputation of a good guy can survive this

16:00.734 --> 16:04.537
is if you stick around.
Just my advice.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.841
I don't care
what people think.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.582
Who would have thought my
freshman year in high school

16:16.617 --> 16:18.885
would have been
my best year?

16:21.489 --> 16:23.557
You're gonna put the bed from their
nursery in the church nursery

16:23.591 --> 16:27.595
where John sleeps? Are you kidding?
That's just creepy.

16:27.629 --> 16:29.764
First of all, John doesn't
sleep in a baby bed anymore

16:29.798 --> 16:31.800
so he won't be
sleeping in it,

16:31.834 --> 16:35.871
and it's not creepy.
Or it wasn't until you said that.

16:35.906 --> 16:37.707
Where was I?
Secondly?

16:37.741 --> 16:39.776
Secondly, the church
really needs that stuff.

16:39.810 --> 16:41.912
There are a lot of mothers
who'd be very grateful

16:41.946 --> 16:44.448
to have the things that
Adrian wants to donate.

16:44.482 --> 16:49.586
Clothes, the, the blankets, diapers.
You know how expensive that stuff is.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.920
Okay, I told you what
Adrian called me about,

16:50.954 --> 16:52.555
now you tell me what
Adrian called you about.

16:52.589 --> 16:54.623
I don't know.
I erased the message.

16:54.657 --> 16:56.591
Without listening to it?
Without listening to it.

16:56.626 --> 16:58.560
That wasn't very nice.

16:58.594 --> 16:59.895
I want to know
what she said!

16:59.929 --> 17:02.597
I don't even know what she said.
Ask her if you're so curious.

17:02.632 --> 17:05.465
She told you she called me.
Ask her what she wanted.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.867
I think we both know
what she wanted.

17:06.902 --> 17:09.569
She is obviously getting ready
to leave Ben and she wants you.

17:09.604 --> 17:10.871
And yet you're helping
her leave Ben.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.839
Because that's the kind
of person I am, Ricky.

17:12.874 --> 17:14.540
I'm telling you,
she knows what she's doing.

17:14.576 --> 17:15.776
She's feeling better.

17:15.810 --> 17:17.845
She's got some crazy
plan she's come up with

17:17.878 --> 17:21.515
and you're playing
right into it and I'm not.

17:29.672 --> 17:31.300
Just tell them I'm
not gonna do it.

17:31.314 --> 17:35.384
Ben, Ben, Ben. You know everyone who
has had this job has been fired.

17:35.418 --> 17:38.554
I don't want to get fired, so I
cannot give your dad that message.

17:38.589 --> 17:40.490
Don't you think you'll get
fired if I don't show up,

17:40.524 --> 17:42.292
and you don't tell him I
wasn't gonna be there?

17:42.326 --> 17:45.662
I have the physical ability to
take you down, little mister.

17:45.696 --> 17:48.666
So you get yourself to
that restaurant on time...

17:51.236 --> 17:53.271
Ben?
I can't.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.541
I can't do it. I can't listen
to another lecture today.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.410
I've had one person after another
today, telling me what they...

17:58.445 --> 17:59.578
I need to talk to you.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.246
Everyone needs to talk
to me. Do you mind?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.582
When you get off the phone.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.584
Telling you what?
What are people telling you?

18:05.618 --> 18:08.253
Same thing that my dad's gonna
to tell me and I can't...

18:08.287 --> 18:11.289
I can't hear it from him. I don't want
to hear it from him. I can't take it.

18:11.323 --> 18:14.225
Of course, you can.
All you have to do is listen to him.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.361
That doesn't mean you
have to do what he says.

18:16.395 --> 18:21.333
You just give the man some respect, you
listen to him and then do what you want.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.501
You don't know my dad.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.336
What, he's a pussycat.

18:26.205 --> 18:27.505
Oh, meow.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.409
What's up, pussycat?
He's right here.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.682
And we were getting
along so well.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.393
Hey, Dad.
Hey, what's up?

18:47.427 --> 18:49.228
You sound like
you're in a good mood.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.663
What are you in such
a good mood about?

18:50.697 --> 18:52.631
I'm just sitting here with Robie,
right next to my favorite gal.

18:52.666 --> 18:55.300
Mom?
Mom? No, Mimsy.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.468
You're over at Mimsy's?

18:56.502 --> 18:58.503
We're over
at your mom's condo.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.606
Just making ourselves at
home like we own the place.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.375
Isn't this
the place I own?

19:02.409 --> 19:05.211
Could be. What do
you need, Ames?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.413
I was just wanted to ask
you if I could go over

19:07.447 --> 19:08.647
and do laundry at your
house tonight.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.216
Yeah, sure, just leave some
quarters on the washer.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.452
Very funny.
You're a funny man.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.621
Uh-oh, what else do you need?
It's really easy.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.191
How easy?
Easy, um...

19:19.226 --> 19:23.262
I just need some
sort of a sleeper couch.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.297
Um, Ricky and I want to
put John in the bedroom,

19:25.331 --> 19:26.565
and then we're going to
sleep in the living room.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.235
It's for John's safety.
I'm sure.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.436
What happened to Ricky
sleeping on the couch?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.304
He's just tired of
sleeping on the couch.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.539
Yeah, I knew that
wouldn't last.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.308
So you'll do it?
No.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.310
You give Ricky back his bedroom,
you come home to your bedroom,

19:38.344 --> 19:39.511
and John goes back
to the little nursery.

19:39.545 --> 19:42.348
It's a win-win-win situation.
Okay.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.419
You're right. Um...

19:47.454 --> 19:51.190
If we need a sofa bed, then we should
just get a sofa bed by ourselves.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.392
All right, I'll have
Donovan email you some pictures,

19:53.426 --> 19:54.526
and you can pick
something out.

19:54.561 --> 19:58.397
Thanks. Um, thank you so much.

19:58.431 --> 20:02.534
I love you. And, and tell Mimsy that
I love her, and Mom too, and Robie.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.703
All right, Amy.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.506
Who was that, sweetie pie?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.675
It's me, Mims. It's George,
your daughter's husband.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.510
I don't have a daughter.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.278
That woman, Anne,
the redhead.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.615
That crazy lady who started
the fire in my apartment?

20:16.650 --> 20:18.284
Yes.
Oh.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.285
She has a temper.
We better watch out.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.320
I'm not afraid of her.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.588
I am.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.557
Hey, what's going on
with your friend?

20:25.591 --> 20:27.392
I don't know.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.628
She doesn't look upset at all.
It's kind of strange.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.297
Well, I told you it
wouldn't be a problem.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.666
I mean, she's ready to
let go and move on,

20:34.701 --> 20:36.601
which I think is
a really good thing.

20:36.636 --> 20:39.437
Okay, well...
I'll be back.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.505
Okay.

20:52.483 --> 20:54.350
That Daniel is really hot.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.252
Yeah, he is.

20:56.286 --> 20:57.420
I almost wish I was single.

20:57.454 --> 21:00.456
You do not and stay away,
that's my boyfriend.

21:00.491 --> 21:03.393
Well, this week.
Yes, this week and next week

21:03.427 --> 21:05.395
and who knows
how many weeks.

21:05.429 --> 21:07.530
I'm not going to think about it.
I'm just going to enjoy it.

21:07.565 --> 21:09.499
Well, yeah, I would.

21:09.534 --> 21:14.504
So are you really, really okay
with all this? You seem okay.

21:14.539 --> 21:17.275
Yeah. I am.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.677
You know, I thought I might
break down once I saw Daniel

21:19.712 --> 21:22.414
actually taking things
out of the room, but...

21:22.448 --> 21:24.449
Yeah, I kind of can't
take my eyes off of him.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.684
He's the perfect
distraction.

21:25.719 --> 21:28.554
Adrian.
What?

21:28.589 --> 21:31.658
So, what made you
decide to do this today?

21:32.694 --> 21:35.362
I went for a walk
this morning,

21:35.397 --> 21:39.300
and I decided that this
is what I wanted to do.

21:39.334 --> 21:42.703
And I decided that I was
gonna be okay with it.

21:42.737 --> 21:45.439
And I'm going to be.

21:45.473 --> 21:47.674
I mean, I'm sure it'll make me sad
to pass by this room for a while,

21:47.709 --> 21:50.410
but it won't be that
long before...

21:50.444 --> 21:52.679
Before?

21:52.713 --> 21:56.715
I can't tell you.
I haven't even told Ben.

21:56.750 --> 22:00.518
I'm gonna have
another baby.

22:00.553 --> 22:04.522
That's what's made me able to do this.
I mean, that's why I can move on.

22:04.556 --> 22:07.224
Because we will have
another baby.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.393
By this time next year.

22:09.427 --> 22:12.295
Just promise not to tell.

22:13.631 --> 22:16.366
Promise.
Thanks.

22:26.411 --> 22:28.579
You thought the meat locker would
be a good place to avoid me?

22:28.613 --> 22:30.514
I'm not avoiding,
I'm working.

22:30.549 --> 22:33.551
And you should
be working, too.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.653
Look, Ben, I don't know what's
going on with this school

22:35.688 --> 22:39.223
that Adrian wants to go to,
but something is going on.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.258
Are you upset that she's giving
away everything in the nursery?

22:41.293 --> 22:42.660
She's not doing that.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.495
She's sitting in there and staring
at the walls all day, every day.

22:44.529 --> 22:48.232
You don't know she's cleaning
out the baby nursery

22:48.266 --> 22:51.335
and giving everything
to the church nursery?

22:51.369 --> 22:53.570
Grace and Amy are helping her,
but they thought you knew.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.405
That can't be true.
She would have told me.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.541
You didn't want to
get rid of that stuff?

23:15.361 --> 23:16.361
Hi, Ben.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.428
What the hell did you do?

23:17.463 --> 23:19.297
What?

23:19.331 --> 23:20.565
You took everything out of
here without even telling me?

23:20.599 --> 23:23.368
I thought you'd be happy.
How could you do this?

23:23.402 --> 23:26.638
But you kept saying...
She was my daughter, too!

23:26.672 --> 23:29.273
And this was my
daughter's nursery!

23:29.308 --> 23:30.574
How could you take
everything out of here

23:30.609 --> 23:33.544
without saying
anything to me, Adrian?

23:33.578 --> 23:37.348
God, all this time I've
been tiptoeing around you,

23:37.383 --> 23:40.284
and doing everything in my power to
make sure that you get through this,

23:40.318 --> 23:43.287
and you haven't even thought
about me for one minute.

23:43.321 --> 23:45.422
Not one minute!
And now you do this!

23:45.457 --> 23:46.523
How could you?

23:46.558 --> 23:49.293
Ben, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize...

23:49.328 --> 23:51.261
Where's Mr. Bear?
Who?

23:51.296 --> 23:52.496
My Bear, Where's Mr. Bear?

23:52.530 --> 23:54.531
I don't know, Grace was
helping me pack and...

23:54.566 --> 23:56.500
My mother gave
that bear to me.

23:56.534 --> 23:59.570
It's the only thing I have left
from her. Where's my bear?

23:59.604 --> 24:01.272
I guess it's with
the other stuff.

24:01.306 --> 24:02.573
I guess it's at
the church nursery. I...

24:02.608 --> 24:08.412
You are so selfish.
Do you know that?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.381
I never even wanted
to marry you.

24:10.416 --> 24:13.351
I never even wanted to have sex
with you in the first place.

24:13.385 --> 24:17.588
Every single bit of pain that both of
us have had has been because of you!

24:17.622 --> 24:20.258
Because of you!

24:20.292 --> 24:26.632
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.

24:26.666 --> 24:31.436
I know I'm supposed to be the man, I'm
not supposed to cry but I don't care.

24:31.471 --> 24:36.274
Losing that baby, it killed
me something in me, Adrian.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.544
It killed my belief that something good
could come from the bad thing we did.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.579
It was a bad thing.

24:41.613 --> 24:44.582
Cheating on Amy and Ricky.

24:44.617 --> 24:48.520
And we deserved
to lose that baby.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.455
At least I did, anyway.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.425
Because Amy loved me.

24:53.459 --> 24:56.427
And I threw it all away
for one night with you.

24:57.663 --> 25:01.366
And I still feel guilty
about that.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.201
I'm always gonna
feel guilty about that,

25:03.235 --> 25:05.436
but maybe I just got
what I deserved.

25:09.306 --> 25:11.241
I'm gonna go get my bear.

25:38.246 --> 25:40.047
Hello?

25:40.415 --> 25:42.049
Guess what we just got.

25:42.084 --> 25:46.054
Oh, yay! The couch
is there. Yay!

25:47.189 --> 25:49.391
You knew about this?

25:49.425 --> 25:52.061
Well, I didn't know that they'd be
able to get it over there tonight.

25:52.095 --> 25:53.930
But I was going to show you
pictures when I got home.

25:53.964 --> 25:56.265
Did we buy this couch?
We can't afford a couch.

25:56.300 --> 26:00.336
No, silly, it's from my dad's store.
He's giving it to us.

26:00.370 --> 26:02.971
No, he's not.
We're paying for it.

26:03.006 --> 26:05.340
I don't want a free couch.
In fact, I don't even want a couch.

26:05.374 --> 26:08.210
Well, it's a bed, too.
You wanted a sofa bed, right?

26:08.244 --> 26:09.277
When did I say that?

26:09.312 --> 26:11.112
This morning.

26:11.147 --> 26:12.347
This morning was a million
years ago, and I don't think

26:12.381 --> 26:15.950
I said I wanted a sofa
bed from your father.

26:15.984 --> 26:17.251
He doesn't even like
us sleeping together.

26:17.286 --> 26:19.254
You asked him for
a bed for us to sleep on?

26:19.288 --> 26:21.423
Yes. I did. Because I
wanted to make you happy.

26:21.457 --> 26:24.092
Well, this doesn't
make me happy.

26:24.126 --> 26:28.164
Okay, well, I'm sorry,

26:28.198 --> 26:31.201
but maybe we can
just sleep on it?

26:33.404 --> 26:36.073
Get it?
I'm not laughing, Amy.

26:36.107 --> 26:39.209
We're supposed to be grown-ups.
We have to pay our own way through life.

26:39.244 --> 26:42.246
I don't want your dad or your mom
buying us whatever you think we need.

26:42.280 --> 26:44.348
Well, they don't mind
helping us once in a while.

26:44.382 --> 26:47.151
That's not the point.
The point is we should mind.

26:47.185 --> 26:50.154
And every time we sleep on that bed, I'm
going to be thinking of your father.

26:50.188 --> 26:53.324
I'm sure you'll
get over it.

26:53.358 --> 26:57.229
Uh, I, I have to go.
Um, Ben just pulled up.

26:57.263 --> 26:59.297
Oh, by the way, I also
called to tell you

26:59.332 --> 27:01.399
he didn't know anything
about the nursery.

27:01.434 --> 27:05.304
He didn't know Adrian was
giving everything away.

27:14.214 --> 27:17.116
I hate to bother you, but, uh,
is the nursery still open?

27:17.151 --> 27:21.321
Yeah, um, there's one
lady that stays late.

27:21.355 --> 27:23.123
Do you want
your things back?

27:23.157 --> 27:26.159
Yeah. There is one
thing I'd like back.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.068
Mr. Bear?

27:36.072 --> 27:37.072
How'd you know?

27:37.106 --> 27:38.974
You told me about him.

27:39.008 --> 27:42.011
Your mom gave him to you.

27:42.045 --> 27:43.946
I knew that it was
probably a mistake.

27:43.980 --> 27:46.215
That he ended up in the
box with the other stuff.

27:50.353 --> 27:52.288
And, um,

27:52.322 --> 27:56.992
I can go get all your other
things back, if you want.

27:57.026 --> 27:59.928
I'm really sorry, Ben.
I didn't know that you didn't know.

27:59.963 --> 28:03.966
It doesn't matter.
The other stuff doesn't matter.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.202
I'm not even sure
that this matters.

28:06.236 --> 28:10.139
I'm not sure anything
matters at all.

28:10.173 --> 28:12.008
Ben, don't.

28:13.310 --> 28:15.444
What happened to us, Amy?

28:17.314 --> 28:20.082
I really loved you.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.985
And John.
And I loved you.

28:24.187 --> 28:27.323
But, Ben, it was
never going to work.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.090
We just couldn't see it.

28:29.125 --> 28:33.428
Can't you see it's never gonna
work with Ricky, either?

28:33.462 --> 28:39.901
He's not...
He's not good enough for you, Amy.

28:39.935 --> 28:43.272
And sooner or later, he's going
to hurt you. That's who he is.

28:43.306 --> 28:45.340
That's who he was.

29:12.369 --> 29:14.070
Did she know
who you were?

29:14.104 --> 29:15.271
Nah, I don't think so.

29:15.306 --> 29:17.040
But we had
a good time, anyway.

29:20.378 --> 29:22.312
It's so depressing,
George.

29:22.346 --> 29:25.081
She can't move back to the little
apartment that she was in.

29:25.116 --> 29:26.383
Even with the nurse
full time.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.251
She has to move to
the section of the home

29:28.286 --> 29:30.954
that's just for
Alzheimer's patients.

29:30.988 --> 29:33.123
Eugene hasn't wanted to do
that, and I haven't either.

29:33.157 --> 29:35.091
But now we have to
move her again.

29:35.126 --> 29:38.094
And each time, she has
less space, less privacy,

29:38.129 --> 29:40.998
more Alzheimer's patients
around her. A lot of more.

29:41.032 --> 29:43.300
And they're a lot
worse than she is.

29:43.334 --> 29:45.969
But what can I do?
She could get hurt,

29:46.003 --> 29:47.103
or she could hurt someone.

29:47.137 --> 29:49.339
I installed safety bolts
at the top of your doors.

29:49.373 --> 29:52.242
So if you needed them,
when she's over here...

29:52.276 --> 29:54.310
Hmm, that was nice.
Thank you.

29:54.345 --> 29:56.012
And you know you can
put black mats

29:56.047 --> 29:57.414
in front of the door
and she won't step across.

29:57.448 --> 30:00.150
Her perception is off, and
she just sees a black hole.

30:00.184 --> 30:01.986
That's what
I read anyway.

30:02.020 --> 30:04.321
Yeah, they do that in the
Alzheimer's area there she's in.

30:04.355 --> 30:07.324
And I read that too, but I
don't totally trust that.

30:07.359 --> 30:09.193
It can't hurt. I can
pick some up for you.

30:09.228 --> 30:12.130
I don't know how much I can
have her here, George.

30:12.164 --> 30:14.333
I can't have her spend the
night here unless you're here.

30:14.367 --> 30:16.435
Because even with those
mats and with the locks,

30:16.469 --> 30:19.004
she can still get out
and wander around.

30:19.038 --> 30:22.474
Well, what if I were
here more often?

30:22.508 --> 30:25.175
Maybe I could come up
a few days a week?

30:25.210 --> 30:27.043
And nights.

30:27.078 --> 30:28.278
Maybe.

30:31.214 --> 30:33.215
I'm gonna go check on Robie.
I could check on Robie.

30:33.249 --> 30:35.217
No, I haven't
seen him all day.

30:35.251 --> 30:38.387
We like to spend time together
after daycare. I want to see him.

30:47.431 --> 30:50.099
Everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.

30:50.133 --> 30:52.201
There's a very expensive
couch in our apartment

30:52.235 --> 30:53.369
that I don't know
how I'm going to pay for.

30:53.403 --> 30:55.237
You're welcome.
It's nice,

30:55.272 --> 30:57.139
but I wish Amy hadn't
asked you to help us.

30:57.174 --> 30:59.074
Yeah, and I wish Amy didn't
live there. But she does.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.076
And the two of you need
somewhere to sleep.

31:01.111 --> 31:03.178
I bought a new mattress before
she started staying over here.

31:03.213 --> 31:06.114
Too much information. And we could
just put our bed in the living room.

31:06.149 --> 31:07.316
But it would look stupid.

31:07.350 --> 31:09.017
And it would advertise
to anyone who comes over

31:09.052 --> 31:10.218
that you two
are sleeping together.

31:10.253 --> 31:12.121
We're not really
hiding that from anyone.

31:12.155 --> 31:13.422
Well, until you're
married, you should.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.991
I don't think we're
gonna get married.

31:16.025 --> 31:17.993
That's why I don't want you
giving us anything,

31:18.027 --> 31:21.129
because I know you want us to get married
and I don't want to feel obligated.

31:21.164 --> 31:23.165
Don't worry, I'm sure if you
didn't feel obligated to marry her

31:23.199 --> 31:25.467
when she had the baby, you're not
going to feel obligated to marry her

31:25.501 --> 31:27.335
when I give you a couch.

31:27.369 --> 31:29.104
You might be right about that.
I'm always right.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.039
And I'm right
about this, too.

31:31.073 --> 31:33.074
Amy is never gonna be happy living
with you and not married to you

31:33.109 --> 31:34.309
because she just doesn't feel
secure with that arrangement.

31:34.343 --> 31:36.344
She's just doing
that to make you happy.

31:36.378 --> 31:38.246
And as an adult, you have to start
thinking about the other person,

31:38.280 --> 31:40.281
the woman you love.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.417
When you have a child, both of you have
to start thinking about the child.

31:42.451 --> 31:45.386
You and Amy have to start thinking
about John, and what's best for John.

31:45.421 --> 31:47.188
I know that.

31:47.223 --> 31:50.125
Thanks for the couch.
You're welcome. Goodnight.

31:50.159 --> 31:52.160
You're welcome for what?

31:52.194 --> 31:54.029
I gave them a new couch.

31:54.063 --> 31:55.965
Oh, yeah,
I helped Amy pick it out.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.133
She forwarded me
the pictures.

31:57.167 --> 31:58.367
Yeah, I told her
to do that.

31:58.402 --> 32:00.136
No, you didn't.

32:01.138 --> 32:02.338
Have you heard from
Ashley tonight?

32:02.372 --> 32:04.206
Yeah. And she's still
looking for a job.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.042
'Cause of course she
hasn't found one yet.

32:06.076 --> 32:08.044
She likes her freedom too much.
She'll get a job.

32:08.078 --> 32:09.212
I'll believe it
when I see it.

32:09.246 --> 32:10.980
Well, if she doesn't,

32:11.014 --> 32:12.248
hopefully, she'll learn
a little something

32:12.282 --> 32:14.184
about the value of an education.
Well, I hope so.

32:14.218 --> 32:16.453
Yeah, me too.

32:16.487 --> 32:19.990
Well, with Mimsy in the guest
room and Robie in his room,

32:20.024 --> 32:24.293
I guess there's really no place
for me to sleep but your room.

32:24.328 --> 32:28.030
That couch folds out, too.

32:28.064 --> 32:30.032
You know, I really just need for
you to stay here for a few days

32:30.066 --> 32:31.434
until I get my mom settled.

32:31.468 --> 32:33.268
Whatever you need.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.371
I don't know where to go.

32:37.340 --> 32:40.142
I don't know
who to talk to.

32:41.177 --> 32:43.312
I was a bad guy already,

32:43.346 --> 32:47.216
before I said
any of that to Adrian.

32:47.250 --> 32:50.119
Hand me another beer.

32:50.154 --> 32:53.289
Never mind,
I'll get it myself.

33:00.196 --> 33:05.033
I wish I hadn't said any of
to Adrian, but, hey, I did.

33:06.102 --> 33:09.003
And I'm gonna have
to live with that

33:09.038 --> 33:11.305
and with all the other
stuff I've done.

33:38.054 --> 33:41.958
All right, Grace.
It's getting late,

33:41.992 --> 33:43.926
I've gotta go.
No, you don't.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.996
My mom's gonna be out with Rachel
for at least another hour.

33:47.030 --> 33:48.131
And Jack's still
out at Madison's.

33:48.165 --> 33:50.867
What does Jack have
to do with anything?

33:50.901 --> 33:53.069
Well, his room
is right next to ours.

33:53.103 --> 33:56.038
This isn't ours,
this is yours.

33:56.072 --> 33:58.975
And I want you to come over
to my apartment sometime,

33:59.009 --> 34:01.043
but I want your mom
to know where you are,

34:01.078 --> 34:05.181
so you're gonna have to tell her I'm
in college and I have my own place.

34:05.215 --> 34:10.954
I'll tell her. Tomorrow.
Promise. But tonight,

34:10.987 --> 34:14.157
tonight I want to thank you for
helping me help my friend.

34:14.190 --> 34:19.195
Yeah, about your
friend, or friends.

34:19.230 --> 34:21.097
You know, you've got one
friend that just lost a baby

34:21.130 --> 34:24.167
and she's trying to have another one...

34:24.201 --> 34:27.036
I promised I wouldn't
tell anyone.

34:27.070 --> 34:28.304
But you did.

34:28.338 --> 34:31.040
And you've got another friend
who has a two-year-old,

34:31.074 --> 34:34.976
and she's a junior in high school and
she's living with the father of the baby.

34:35.011 --> 34:37.980
And they're not married?
Yeah?

34:38.014 --> 34:40.149
Well, you know they say your
friends are a reflection of you.

34:40.183 --> 34:42.150
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:43.018 --> 34:45.087
Oh.

34:45.121 --> 34:47.790
Well, what can I say?

34:47.824 --> 34:50.859
All three of us really like sex and one
of us is more careful than the other two.

34:50.893 --> 34:54.063
Yeah, and I'm more
careful than all of you.

34:54.097 --> 34:55.998
But you scare me
a little bit.

34:56.032 --> 34:58.133
I don't want you to get any
thoughts about having any babies.

34:58.167 --> 35:02.037
Because I don't want any babies.
Not for a long time.

35:02.071 --> 35:05.039
Neither do I.
Good.

35:05.073 --> 35:08.109
So you're on
the pill, right?

35:08.143 --> 35:10.078
Yeah. And...

35:10.112 --> 35:12.146
I have condoms, and you have
condoms, and we both agreed

35:12.181 --> 35:15.850
that you will use condoms.
Yeah, well, well, good.

35:15.884 --> 35:18.986
So we have all the technical
precautions in place.

35:19.020 --> 35:22.089
Now we just have to figure out
how we feel about each other.

35:23.158 --> 35:25.026
But we, we already...

35:25.060 --> 35:26.962
Yeah, we have.

35:26.996 --> 35:28.163
So we know that we
like each other.

35:28.197 --> 35:31.867
Yeah, I'm not sure
that that's enough.

35:31.901 --> 35:34.937
Maybe I'd like to know that
you feel a little more than

35:34.971 --> 35:36.004
friendship for me.

35:36.039 --> 35:37.039
Why?

35:39.008 --> 35:41.142
Because you're
a very fickle girl.

35:47.082 --> 35:48.082
Goodnight.

35:48.117 --> 35:50.018
I'll walk you out.

36:00.163 --> 36:03.866
Look, now don't be angry with me just
because I think you're a little crazy.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.803
Right, that's what attracted
me to you in the first place.

36:06.837 --> 36:08.271
Well, I'm not crazy.

36:08.306 --> 36:11.108
And I'm not fickle. And for your
information, I'm a Christian.

36:11.142 --> 36:14.178
You told me that already,
when we were in Africa,

36:14.213 --> 36:15.913
I think right in
the middle of us...

36:15.947 --> 36:17.214
Will you shut up!

36:18.050 --> 36:19.950
Goodnight, Grace.

36:23.021 --> 36:24.854
Oh. Am I interrupting?

36:24.889 --> 36:26.055
No.

36:35.865 --> 36:37.033
Goodnight.

36:45.143 --> 36:47.979
I broke up with Madison.
What? Why?

36:48.013 --> 36:50.081
Because she's right.
I'm still in love with you.

36:50.116 --> 36:52.918
Are you blind? Did you
not just see that?

36:52.952 --> 36:54.920
I saw you had one eye open.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.927
I have a boyfriend
and I love him, okay?

37:01.961 --> 37:05.030
I love him! I'm in
love with Daniel!

37:05.064 --> 37:06.197
Uh...

37:08.067 --> 37:09.967
Now that's more like it.

37:10.002 --> 37:12.036
Goodnight, Grace.

37:29.087 --> 37:31.889
Hmm. Hey, Dad!

37:32.924 --> 37:34.892
We're here!

37:36.961 --> 37:39.797
Good evening.

37:39.831 --> 37:41.165
Nice tie.
Thank you.

37:44.036 --> 37:45.937
Um, I'm sorry we're late.

37:45.971 --> 37:48.773
We had to take a cab.
From where?

37:48.807 --> 37:50.107
From the liquor store.
You're drunk?

37:50.142 --> 37:53.110
No, I wouldn't say I'm drunk,
but I'm celebrating, yes.

37:53.145 --> 37:55.012
Celebrating what?

37:55.046 --> 37:58.015
I finally found a way
out of my marriage.

37:58.049 --> 37:59.851
And what was that?

37:59.885 --> 38:01.152
Honesty. Hmm.

38:07.059 --> 38:09.195
He's in mourning.

38:24.111 --> 38:25.812
Amy.

38:25.847 --> 38:27.080
In here.

38:33.087 --> 38:34.087
Oh, we're gonna do laundry?

38:34.121 --> 38:35.988
Why else would you
be over here?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.990
To get away from you.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.959
I was just trying
to make you happy.

38:39.993 --> 38:42.028
Don't try to make me happy.
Do whatever makes you happy.

38:42.062 --> 38:44.130
I did. I got us a couch

38:44.164 --> 38:46.933
and then I came over here because
I didn't want to sleep on it

38:46.967 --> 38:49.068
with you for the first time
when you're angry with me.

38:49.102 --> 38:51.070
You can't just call
your dad to fix things.

38:51.104 --> 38:53.940
It's not me and you and your
dad in this relationship.

38:53.974 --> 38:58.778
It's just me and you.
I know that. But...

38:58.812 --> 39:01.848
I still need my parents. I think I'm
always going to need my parents.

39:01.882 --> 39:03.149
You're going in
the wrong direction.

39:03.184 --> 39:05.986
Ricky, they're my parents!

39:10.158 --> 39:11.958
I need them for stuff.

39:11.992 --> 39:15.095
That's not what parents
are for, for stuff.

39:15.129 --> 39:17.063
I know what you're thinking.

39:17.097 --> 39:19.032
I'm not the best judge
of what parents are for.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.867
I did not say that.

39:20.901 --> 39:23.068
Look, this whole thing started
when I woke up and found that John

39:23.103 --> 39:26.004
wasn't sleeping next to me.
I don't like surprises.

39:26.039 --> 39:29.040
I didn't like having two guys show
up from your dad's furniture store

39:29.075 --> 39:32.010
to deliver a couch when Bunny and
everyone else was still around.

39:32.044 --> 39:35.747
I don't like surprises, I
really don't. But I'm over it.

39:35.781 --> 39:36.981
Okay? I'm over it.

39:37.016 --> 39:39.785
But we had an agreement
that you wouldn't run home

39:39.819 --> 39:42.088
when we have an argument
and here you are.

39:42.122 --> 39:46.092
Yeah, I know.
No one was here.

39:46.127 --> 39:49.897
So it's not really
the same thing.

39:49.931 --> 39:51.966
It's kind of
the same thing.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.970
Ugh, I know.
Okay, it's the same thing.

39:57.004 --> 40:01.808
I'm sorry. I just can't stand to see
you when I've disappointed you.

40:01.842 --> 40:03.076
And I know
I disappointed you.

40:03.110 --> 40:04.844
Is that really it?

40:04.879 --> 40:07.046
Are you still angry about
the phone call from Adrian?

40:07.081 --> 40:09.782
Did you listen to it?
I told you, I erased it.

40:09.816 --> 40:12.885
Ricky, please don't have anything
to do with Adrian. Please.

40:12.919 --> 40:15.954
Who has the time?
Look at all this laundry.

40:16.856 --> 40:19.058
I won't. Promise.

40:21.996 --> 40:23.998
All right. Well,

40:25.100 --> 40:27.835
let's get John and go home.

40:27.870 --> 40:29.037
What about all this stuff?

40:29.071 --> 40:30.805
It's too late, I'm tired.

40:30.839 --> 40:33.041
Then you go to bed,
and I'll do the laundry.

40:33.076 --> 40:34.943
When I'm finished,
I'll get in bed with you.

40:34.977 --> 40:37.746
We've never done
anything in your room.

40:37.780 --> 40:39.948
No, we haven't.

40:39.982 --> 40:42.150
And I will take
you up on that.

40:59.134 --> 41:01.169
<i>You have</i>

41:04.874 --> 41:08.978
