00:02.187 --> 00:04.785
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- MAZE: <i>You're the Lord of Hell,</i>

00:04.843 --> 00:05.834
for crying out loud.

00:05.869 --> 00:08.156
Shouldn't you be spending
your valuable time

00:08.191 --> 00:10.692
doing something more significant?

00:10.727 --> 00:13.232
I'm retired, Maze. I've
got nothing but time.

00:13.267 --> 00:15.924
Your return to the
Underworld has been requested.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.928
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

00:17.963 --> 00:20.541
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

00:21.232 --> 00:22.826
<i>We should be out there
solving a homicide</i>

00:22.861 --> 00:24.558
<i>and punishing those responsible.</i>

00:24.593 --> 00:26.299
We? How could you possibly help me?

00:26.334 --> 00:27.407
I have the ability

00:27.442 --> 00:29.772
to draw out peoples' forbidden desires.

00:29.807 --> 00:31.972
I got it. I got it. The name,

00:32.006 --> 00:33.243
the whole Lucifer thing.

00:33.278 --> 00:34.800
And desire is like your superpower.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.445
Mm, it's more like a gift from God really.

00:36.515 --> 00:37.933
You're thinking about it, aren't you?

00:37.968 --> 00:39.095
See, I wouldn't recommend it.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.229
I'm like walking heroin.

00:40.264 --> 00:42.051
Ah, you're the Devil. (laughs)

00:42.086 --> 00:43.349
Mm, correct.

00:43.384 --> 00:44.951
(gunshot, Chloe gasps)

00:47.811 --> 00:50.044
(gunshots, Lucifer grunting)

00:50.214 --> 00:51.809
Give me one second.

00:53.798 --> 00:55.957
Please. Please don't kill me.

00:55.992 --> 00:58.300
You're gonna wish that's all I did to you.

00:58.730 --> 01:00.075
MAZE: <i>I just can't understand</i>

01:00.110 --> 01:02.205
<i>why you would save a human life.</i>

01:02.240 --> 01:03.306
Something different about her

01:03.341 --> 01:05.555
that I don't quite
understand, and it vexes me.

01:05.635 --> 01:07.384
Maybe it's not her that's different.

01:07.419 --> 01:08.641
LUCIFER: <i>Right. Here's the deal.</i>

01:08.676 --> 01:11.155
We can have as much naked
cuddle time as you desire,

01:11.190 --> 01:13.245
but you're gonna have to listen to me, too.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.772
You know, just an existential
dilemma or two. Deal?

01:15.807 --> 01:17.419
LINDA: <i>Yes.</i>

01:40.611 --> 01:43.679
Repent your sins before it is too late!

01:43.714 --> 01:45.788
It is the end of times!

01:45.823 --> 01:47.393
The Devil walks among us!

01:47.428 --> 01:51.520
Padre, you have no idea how
right you are. (chuckles)

01:51.555 --> 01:53.122
But there's no need to be angry about it.

01:53.157 --> 01:54.390
Enjoy the ride.

01:54.425 --> 01:55.791
MAN: Bless you.

01:55.826 --> 01:57.626
Have you seen the face of the Devil?

01:57.661 --> 02:00.662
Oh, every morning in the mirror, pal.

02:00.698 --> 02:02.030
Exactly!

02:02.066 --> 02:03.432
He's in all of us!

02:03.467 --> 02:05.567
In our every moment of weakness.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.002
Look at this world!

02:07.037 --> 02:09.604
The sin, the lust!

02:09.639 --> 02:10.773
It is the Devil's touch.

02:10.808 --> 02:12.875
N-N-No, don't give me
credit for all that.

02:12.910 --> 02:15.277
You humans do plenty all on your own.

02:15.312 --> 02:17.546
(microphone feedback squeals)

02:17.581 --> 02:19.014
(sighs)

02:20.147 --> 02:21.817
What's your problem, pal?

02:22.064 --> 02:23.719
Excuse me?

02:23.754 --> 02:25.702
Yeah, uh, why don't you
move your shtick along.

02:25.737 --> 02:26.967
Okay, I'm not sharing my tips with you,

02:27.002 --> 02:29.391
- if that's what you're angling for.
- Oh.

02:29.427 --> 02:31.155
Right. Is this a performance?

02:31.190 --> 02:33.228
Are you like the Chewbacca and
the Spider-Man down the street?

02:33.264 --> 02:34.963
I have to say, you're very good.

02:34.999 --> 02:36.732
Yeah, so why don't you go bother them.

02:36.805 --> 02:38.247
You're bad for my business.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.084
Repent! The Devil...

02:40.173 --> 02:42.909
Isn't finished with you yet.

02:43.796 --> 02:46.577
You see, what I hate more
than anything is a liar,

02:46.612 --> 02:50.952
a charlatan, someone who
doesn't believe in what they say.

02:51.534 --> 02:53.248
So what are you gonna do about it?

02:53.505 --> 02:56.784
Why, make you a believer, of course.

02:58.589 --> 02:59.721
(screams)

02:59.757 --> 03:01.523
S-S... uh, stay away!

03:01.559 --> 03:02.858
He's the Devil!

03:02.893 --> 03:03.900
You don't understand!

03:03.935 --> 03:06.534
This isn't a performance! He's the Devil!

03:06.569 --> 03:07.963
- He's the Devil!
- (crowd clamoring)

03:07.998 --> 03:09.965
- It's true. It is true.
- (applause)

03:12.870 --> 03:14.709
(chuckles) Yes, thanks, everyone.

03:14.744 --> 03:17.711
I'm, uh, here till, well, the
end of time, actually. (laughs)

03:17.806 --> 03:19.741
- LINDA: <i>So you're the Devil.</i>
- LUCIFER: <i>Yes.</i>

03:19.777 --> 03:24.386
Yes. Well, Satan, Beelzebub, Old Scratch.

03:24.482 --> 03:26.448
Actually, I like that one in particular.

03:26.528 --> 03:28.094
But, uh, those were the old me.

03:28.129 --> 03:30.123
These days, you just
have plain old Lucifer.

03:30.158 --> 03:34.545
And you've left Hell behind to
take a vacation in Los Angeles.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.353
Well, where else would I go?

03:37.795 --> 03:39.312
You don't seem too bothered

03:39.366 --> 03:41.790
by my being the Prince of Darkness.

03:41.923 --> 03:44.199
I'm willing to work within your metaphor.

03:44.668 --> 03:45.634
Right.

03:45.669 --> 03:47.903
Sometimes it's easier
to make intimate issues

03:47.938 --> 03:50.372
about something bigger than yourself.

03:50.407 --> 03:52.574
Well, there are few
things bigger than myself.

03:52.610 --> 03:54.393
I'm well aware.

03:54.448 --> 03:56.139
(chuckles)

03:56.225 --> 03:58.413
(sighs): Ah.

03:58.449 --> 04:02.885
Last we spoke, you were bothered
about feelings of humanity.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.287
I was, yes, but I have good
news for you on that front.

04:05.322 --> 04:06.469
I'm healed.

04:06.504 --> 04:07.422
Is that so?

04:07.458 --> 04:10.240
Yes. Yes, back to my normal, devilish self.

04:10.275 --> 04:12.247
No pesky empathy to be found.

04:12.282 --> 04:14.138
I'd kick a puppy if one waltzed by.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.569
I'm joking. Puppies don't waltz.

04:17.014 --> 04:19.023
You like to hide insecurity in humor,

04:19.058 --> 04:19.918
don't you?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.476
(laughs): I don't have insecurities.

04:21.550 --> 04:24.632
Mm. Everyone does.

04:25.707 --> 04:28.844
(sighs) Very well. I'll play your game.

04:29.118 --> 04:30.815
What do you think I'm insecure about?

04:30.850 --> 04:33.248
That you <i>are</i> changing,

04:33.284 --> 04:36.143
but that you don't know
what's causing the change.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.045
Or who.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.593
We'll pick this up next time.

04:41.628 --> 04:43.803
What? Oh, very well.

04:43.838 --> 04:46.260
A deal's a deal. Though, why do I feel

04:46.295 --> 04:48.047
like you're getting more
out of our bargain than I am?

04:48.082 --> 04:49.131

05:29.254 --> 05:30.673
This is from Lucifer?

05:30.708 --> 05:33.241
He asked me to make you
something you'd like.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.151
Did I get it wrong?

05:35.292 --> 05:37.944
You and Lucifer seem really close.

05:38.222 --> 05:40.616
I followed him through the gates of Hell.

05:40.651 --> 05:42.351
I'll take that as a "yes."

05:42.386 --> 05:43.852
(laughs)

05:47.491 --> 05:49.791
(piano playing gentle melody)

06:04.041 --> 06:06.274
(sighs) Hello, Detective.

06:06.310 --> 06:08.677
How has your undercover surveillance

06:08.712 --> 06:10.412
of my activities gone so far?

06:10.447 --> 06:12.274
I've looked into you.

06:12.309 --> 06:14.552
Your name really is Lucifer Morningstar.

06:14.587 --> 06:17.619
And as far as I can tell, you
didn't exist five years ago.

06:17.654 --> 06:19.154
On the earthly plane, no.

06:19.189 --> 06:22.758
People don't appear out of thin air.

06:22.793 --> 06:24.369
Who were you?

06:24.408 --> 06:28.065
How did you survive getting
shot six times by Jimmy Barnes?

06:28.213 --> 06:30.632
Is that your normal reaction
to someone saving your life?

06:30.668 --> 06:32.470
- Investigating them?
- When I see something

06:32.505 --> 06:34.508
I can't explain, yeah, I look for answers.

06:34.543 --> 06:37.506
Well, I've given you the answer, Detective.
It's not my fault you won't accept it.

06:37.541 --> 06:38.439
Do you know what I think?

06:38.474 --> 06:40.192
I stopped trying to guess.

06:40.227 --> 06:41.777
I think you like me.

06:41.812 --> 06:44.590
What part of the look on my
face gives you that impression?

06:44.625 --> 06:47.226
No, no, no, it's not about
the face. It's about the eyes,

06:47.261 --> 06:48.612
what's behind them. I think you see

06:48.665 --> 06:51.424
something that you truly desire, and you...

06:51.471 --> 06:52.728
you don't know what to do with yourself,

06:52.798 --> 06:55.090
do you?

06:55.125 --> 06:56.958
Really?

06:56.994 --> 06:58.260
Uh-huh.

06:58.295 --> 06:59.561
- (chuckles)
- (laughs)

06:59.654 --> 07:02.084
- Hmm. (laughs)
- That's more like it.

07:02.547 --> 07:03.765
(sighs)

07:05.581 --> 07:08.275
Detective, I never knew
you cared. (chuckles)

07:08.310 --> 07:09.138
Mm.

07:09.457 --> 07:11.580
Ooh. (laughing)

07:13.575 --> 07:15.441
(sighs)

07:17.032 --> 07:18.647
(both sigh)

07:18.767 --> 07:20.936
No bulletproof vest.

07:21.321 --> 07:22.077
What?

07:22.113 --> 07:23.494
I just couldn't imagine how you'd get it

07:23.529 --> 07:25.583
under that suit, but I had to check.

07:25.618 --> 07:27.425
What is it? What is it? What is it?

07:27.460 --> 07:29.148
I'm gonna figure out your secret, Lucifer.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.457
Not a secret if I'm telling you the answer!

07:31.492 --> 07:33.695
It's...

07:34.267 --> 07:36.024
Why don't I affect you, Detective?

07:36.059 --> 07:37.799
What makes you different?

07:37.948 --> 07:39.935
I guess we both have our mysteries.

07:39.970 --> 07:42.471
Ah. Well, I'll show you
mine if you show me yours.

07:42.506 --> 07:43.670
(phone ringing)

07:43.705 --> 07:45.607
Oh, God, not that again.

07:46.038 --> 07:47.278
Decker.

07:49.313 --> 07:50.612
Are you sure?

07:50.647 --> 07:51.747
Yes.

07:51.782 --> 07:54.182
Yes, um, please send me the address.

07:54.218 --> 07:56.079
I... I owe you one.

07:56.114 --> 07:58.770
(sighs) Oh, finally.

07:58.874 --> 08:01.414
Now <i>that</i> affected you. What was it?

08:02.753 --> 08:04.094
Detective?

08:04.461 --> 08:06.461
Detective?!

08:09.066 --> 08:11.299
(indistinct police radio
chatter, camera clicking)

08:11.335 --> 08:13.435
Come on. Active scene.

08:19.309 --> 08:21.778
The victim was being
followed by a paparazzo.

08:21.813 --> 08:22.811
Tried to lose his tail.

08:22.846 --> 08:24.513
Instead, lost control of his car.

08:24.548 --> 08:26.024
Died on impact.

08:26.247 --> 08:27.885
The paparazzo following him was...?

08:27.953 --> 08:29.918
Was Nick Hofmeister, yeah.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.020
Who's the victim?

08:33.335 --> 08:35.091
Robbie Russell Jr.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.192
The son of the movie star?

08:37.614 --> 08:39.624
He wasn't in the business, was he?

08:39.687 --> 08:41.828
Didn't stop everyone from
wanting pictures of him.

08:41.863 --> 08:42.982
They're vultures.

08:43.018 --> 08:44.633
You get a statement from Nick?

08:44.668 --> 08:48.103
You can't be involved in an active
case until you're off medical leave.

08:49.251 --> 08:52.073
Listen, I get why you
wanted to be here, I do.

08:52.854 --> 08:54.409
But you have to bring him?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.316
You've got to be kidding me.

09:01.860 --> 09:03.278
What are you doing here?

09:03.555 --> 09:05.383
Oh! How's your ex?

09:05.442 --> 09:07.128
He's not the reason you
rushed over here, is he?

09:07.194 --> 09:08.427
Answer the question.

09:08.492 --> 09:10.354
I'm trying to solve my mystery, Detective.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.641
If I don't affect you, I'm
curious as to what does.

09:14.565 --> 09:17.851
Oh, and I think I've just found my answer.

09:17.886 --> 09:18.917
Who's that?

09:19.022 --> 09:20.202
He's a paparazzo.

09:20.237 --> 09:22.120
Oh. Had a little run-in with him

Yeah, you could say that. He's a cockroach.

But he'll figure a way out
of this. He always does.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.846
You want to talk to him, don't you?

09:30.881 --> 09:32.681
Well, go on, then. What's stopping you?

Hello.

09:43.895 --> 09:45.645
CHLOE: You finally did it, Nick.

09:45.749 --> 09:49.113
You finally wanted a photo so
bad that you killed someone.

09:49.199 --> 09:50.265
You're not gonna get away with this.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.944
I'm gonna make sure of it.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.468
You're right.

09:53.503 --> 09:54.479
- Say that again?
- You're right.

09:54.514 --> 09:56.918
I went too far. I'll confess.

09:57.711 --> 09:58.408
Okay.

09:58.443 --> 10:01.503
Maybe he's less cockroach,
more dung beetle?

10:01.634 --> 10:03.208
Police work always this easy?

10:03.243 --> 10:04.316
No. That's the problem.

10:04.351 --> 10:06.775
Right. Well, do you mind
if I give it a whirl?

10:06.810 --> 10:09.184
Tell me, dung beetle,

10:09.219 --> 10:11.753
what is it you desire?

10:13.281 --> 10:17.292
I... would like to confess.

10:17.327 --> 10:19.030
Yes, yes, yes, but why?

10:19.065 --> 10:20.386
Because I deserve it.

10:20.421 --> 10:22.064
I've just done...

- He? Who?

10:34.880 --> 10:35.810
Would you please make him stop?

10:35.887 --> 10:37.058
- Who? He who?
- Him.

10:37.093 --> 10:37.869
- Tell him.
- What are you hiding?

10:37.904 --> 10:39.721
- What are you doing? Hey.
- You said "he." Who?

10:39.756 --> 10:42.092
Neither one of you are supposed
to be here. Especially you.

10:42.127 --> 10:43.318

- Come on.

10:43.485 --> 10:45.692

Yes, plenty of murderers
are out there, Detective.

10:57.501 --> 11:00.030
You heard the man. He
deserves the punishment.

11:00.065 --> 11:01.937

18:15.055 --> 18:16.821
Detective?

18:18.187 --> 18:19.153
Detective?

18:19.188 --> 18:20.477
Mm-hmm.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.199
I understand.

18:22.525 --> 18:24.458
Mm-hmm.

18:24.688 --> 18:25.463
Hello, there.

18:25.550 --> 18:27.917
I'd very much like to see Nick Hofmeister.

18:28.015 --> 18:31.012
I'm afraid I can't... Oh.

18:32.523 --> 18:33.567
Hello.

18:33.745 --> 18:34.699
Hello to you.

18:34.734 --> 18:35.531
- MAN (over phone): Hello?
- (chuckles)

18:35.566 --> 18:38.174
(chuckles)

18:38.574 --> 18:39.614
(door opens)

18:39.683 --> 18:41.916
LUCIFER: Afternoon, dung beetle.

18:44.278 --> 18:45.835
We need to talk.

18:45.960 --> 18:46.513
(chuckles)

18:46.601 --> 18:49.643
I, um, I'm not gonna
tell you anything, man.

18:49.678 --> 18:51.257
No, no, no, I don't want
to know about the case,

18:51.347 --> 18:54.548
so you can keep your dirty little secrets.

18:54.704 --> 18:57.468
No, I'd like to know about Chloe Decker.

18:57.963 --> 19:00.827
And you're gonna tell me everything.

19:05.856 --> 19:07.391
I have an effect on people.

19:07.456 --> 19:08.781
It's a way of pulling out

19:08.816 --> 19:12.175
their deepest desires,
revealing the truth within.

19:12.210 --> 19:13.840
It works on everyone.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.420
Everyone except for Chloe Decker.

19:15.475 --> 19:17.611
And I suspect it's somehow related

19:17.646 --> 19:19.457
to my recent bouts of humanity.

19:19.554 --> 19:20.762
What does this have to do with me?

19:20.797 --> 19:22.269
Well, you know everything
about her, don't you?

19:22.304 --> 19:23.944
All her sordid secrets.

19:24.045 --> 19:25.285
I'm hoping they'll help me understand

19:25.320 --> 19:28.060
why she's so frustratingly
immune to my charms.

19:28.131 --> 19:30.246
Chloe doesn't have any sordid secrets.

19:30.281 --> 19:32.248
(chuckles)

19:32.486 --> 19:35.391
I've seen the hatred in her
eyes when she looks at you.

19:35.426 --> 19:37.909
Come on. You must have something.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.777
Do you know what happened when she was 19?

19:39.854 --> 19:41.307
She starred in <i>Hot Tub High School</i>

19:41.342 --> 19:44.047
and revealed her rather
spectacular assets to the world.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.883
Right.

19:45.919 --> 19:49.140
And two weeks later, her father died.

19:49.998 --> 19:51.014
Oh.

19:51.049 --> 19:52.675
Yeah, so I knew, of course,

19:52.710 --> 19:54.307
everyone in the world was gonna try to get

19:54.342 --> 19:57.275
a... shot of them leaving the funeral.

19:57.310 --> 20:00.553
And I really... (chuckles)
I really wanted to be first.

20:00.588 --> 20:02.731
Oh, dung beetle, tell me you didn't.

20:02.830 --> 20:04.686
Yeah, I crashed the funeral.

20:04.721 --> 20:08.061
And... she... oh, she flipped out.

20:08.096 --> 20:09.507
But I got my photo.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.926
Right when she punched the lens.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.886
I mean, right then... it
cracked the lens right in half.

20:12.921 --> 20:16.314
- I made so much money off that photo.
- I'm sure.

20:19.015 --> 20:23.400
Yeah, but at what cost to my soul, right?

20:23.435 --> 20:24.656
(chuckles)

20:24.691 --> 20:27.444
And that'll be for someone else to decide.

20:27.479 --> 20:28.562
(chuckles): Yeah.

20:28.597 --> 20:30.442
Well, that someone else
is sitting opposite you,

20:30.477 --> 20:32.052
and it's not looking good.

20:32.087 --> 20:33.498
I crossed a line.

20:33.579 --> 20:34.630
And I knew it.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.229
And after that, I just
did everything I could

20:36.305 --> 20:38.608
to keep others from making
the same mistakes I did.

20:38.643 --> 20:40.276
That's why I...

20:42.623 --> 20:43.708
Why what?

20:43.789 --> 20:45.501
- No, it's...
- You want to tell me.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.844
- It's nothing.
- Who are you protecting

20:46.880 --> 20:48.791
- from following in your footsteps?
- I can't.

20:48.826 --> 20:51.890
- It's... I just... I can't.
- You want to tell me, don't you?

20:52.039 --> 20:53.661
- I really can't.
- You want to tell me.

20:53.696 --> 20:54.819
Who are you protecting?

20:54.854 --> 20:55.820
Who are you protecting?

20:55.855 --> 20:57.355
How are you doing this, man?

20:57.390 --> 20:58.690
Look at me.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.191
Who are you protecting?

21:00.226 --> 21:01.212
Please, just...

21:01.247 --> 21:02.960
- Look at me. Look at me.
- I won't. I won't.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.362
- I can't.
- Look at me!

21:04.397 --> 21:05.830
Leave me alone!

21:06.013 --> 21:07.146
(door closes)

21:14.773 --> 21:17.687
MAN: I already spoke to
the police about Robbie.

21:17.820 --> 21:20.411
I don't know what else there is to say.

21:21.148 --> 21:22.714
I'm just following up.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.049
I want to make sure there aren't
any suspects we overlooked.

21:25.085 --> 21:27.518
But I was told Nick Hofmeister confessed.

21:28.536 --> 21:29.935
He did.

21:31.379 --> 21:35.174
Mr. Russell, I, um...

21:35.757 --> 21:37.873
I don't think Nick killed your son.

21:37.908 --> 21:39.497
What?

21:39.532 --> 21:42.217
Are you... Is this a joke?

21:42.498 --> 21:44.167
I'm sorry.

21:44.810 --> 21:47.711
Y-You just don't know

21:47.972 --> 21:51.007
what Robbie went through
because of my work.

21:51.653 --> 21:53.891
Now he's dead because of me.

21:54.001 --> 21:55.046
No.

21:55.081 --> 21:58.017
You know, my mom is Penelope Decker.

21:58.129 --> 22:00.084
So I was followed by paparazzi all my life,

22:00.120 --> 22:02.019
just like Robbie.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.085
But, you know, that wasn't my mom's fault.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.574
And you got to know, it's
not your fault either.

22:06.660 --> 22:07.792
The only person you can blame

22:07.827 --> 22:09.946
is whoever ran your son off the road.

22:10.099 --> 22:12.451
I want to make sure we get the right guy.

22:12.486 --> 22:15.287
And I'm telling you, I
don't think Nick is him.

22:17.107 --> 22:19.203
There was one other paparazzo.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.001
Did you get a name or a description?

22:21.036 --> 22:21.714
No, I didn't.

22:21.776 --> 22:24.154
Because Robbie only noticed him once.

22:24.189 --> 22:26.589
That's why I never mentioned him before.

22:27.739 --> 22:29.013
Thank you.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.381
(phone ringing)

22:30.416 --> 22:32.550
Excuse me.

22:34.401 --> 22:35.820
(sighs)

22:35.855 --> 22:37.522
Decker.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.058
He did what?

22:50.003 --> 22:51.469
What is wrong with you?

22:51.504 --> 22:52.837
(sighs)

22:52.872 --> 22:54.217
Nothing is wrong with me.

22:54.252 --> 22:56.511
I was hoping for sexy, salacious details,

22:56.546 --> 23:00.047
and instead I got taken on
a trip down depression lane.

23:01.393 --> 23:04.875
You feel bad for invading her privacy?

23:04.910 --> 23:07.310
You're the Lord of Hell.

23:07.375 --> 23:10.744
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but Amenadiel is right.

23:10.966 --> 23:12.911
You are changing.

23:12.946 --> 23:15.159
I don't mind the odd
smart-assed remark, Maze.

23:15.195 --> 23:16.252
They can be quite amusing.

23:16.287 --> 23:18.710
But don't you dare disrespect me.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.448
Or what?

23:20.529 --> 23:22.203
You'll cry really hard on my shoulder?

23:22.238 --> 23:24.605
You will not speak to me this way!

23:26.773 --> 23:29.340
(whispers): There he is.

23:31.596 --> 23:34.435
CHLOE: How did you get
into Nick's holding cell?

23:34.581 --> 23:36.214
And there he goes.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.415
Oh, sorry.

23:37.507 --> 23:40.573
Am I interrupting some
creepy foreplay you two have?

23:40.608 --> 23:42.797
How did you get into Nick's holding cell?

23:42.832 --> 23:44.589
Why, by asking very nicely, of course.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.141
Something you should try sometime.

23:46.228 --> 23:49.227
This case has nothing to do with you.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.588
Why won't you leave it alone?

23:50.643 --> 23:52.243
Why won't you?

23:52.927 --> 23:54.498
Did you learn something, at least?

23:54.600 --> 23:57.635
Yes. I did, actually.

23:57.774 --> 23:59.178
Our dung beetle is protecting

23:59.248 --> 24:02.235
someone who's following in his footsteps.

24:02.322 --> 24:03.642
Protégé, perhaps.

24:03.706 --> 24:05.615
I found out someone else
was following Robbie,

24:05.650 --> 24:07.484
and someone's been uploading photos online

24:07.519 --> 24:09.752
today from Nick's company.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.383
Last one was posted an hour ago

24:11.418 --> 24:13.985
from a party that's still happening.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.717
Our killer could be there.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.272
Right.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.390
Are you coming or what?

24:19.425 --> 24:21.465
Oh, sorry, I thought this was
the part where you leave me behind

24:21.500 --> 24:23.064
and say something like, "Lucifer, stay.

24:23.099 --> 24:25.686
- Good devil."
- I'd rather keep my eye on you.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.101
♪ Tell me what you like ♪

24:29.136 --> 24:31.737
♪ Tell me what you like ♪

24:31.853 --> 24:33.571
♪ Tell me what you like ♪

24:33.606 --> 24:35.473
♪ Tell me what you like... ♪

24:35.508 --> 24:37.842
(paparazzi clamoring, cameras clicking)

24:42.709 --> 24:45.949
LUCIFER: So how do you plan on
catching our murderous protégé anyway?

24:45.984 --> 24:48.830
Well, I was thinking, what if he
never left the scene of the crime?

24:48.954 --> 24:52.264
What, and instead blended in with
the other paparazzi taking photos?

24:52.299 --> 24:53.997
That's quite clever.

24:54.032 --> 24:57.767
Yeah, so if we recognize anyone
from the crash, it could be our guy.

24:57.802 --> 24:59.295
Right.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.434
LUCIFER: Are you okay?

25:03.469 --> 25:04.835
I'm fine.

25:05.089 --> 25:06.638
Why?

25:07.664 --> 25:09.952
Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he?

25:10.107 --> 25:11.163
He did.

25:11.265 --> 25:13.744
Got to hear all about
your wicked right hook.

25:13.923 --> 25:15.005
Oh, yeah.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.207
He also told me it was a low point for him.

25:17.242 --> 25:19.254
Which I believe, actually.

25:19.372 --> 25:21.585
Yeah, I think our dung
beetle, of all things,

25:21.620 --> 25:24.621
desires redemption for what he did to you.

25:25.161 --> 25:26.958
Yeah, well, he's not going
about it the right way,

25:26.993 --> 25:29.308
- that's for sure.
- Yes, well, we all know

25:29.389 --> 25:32.269
what the road to Hell
is paved with, don't we?

25:33.013 --> 25:34.927
Hello, hello, hello.

25:35.143 --> 25:36.859
There's a familiar face.

25:36.984 --> 25:39.603
CHLOE: Yeah, from the
crime scene this morning.

25:39.834 --> 25:42.923
- I remember him.
- And he's spectacularly creepy as well,

25:42.958 --> 25:43.749
so that's a bonus.

25:43.784 --> 25:45.830
Hey, everybody, it's Chloe Decker!

25:45.865 --> 25:47.078
Penelope Decker's daughter!

25:47.113 --> 25:48.245
(paparazzi clamoring)

25:48.281 --> 25:49.881
- Chloe, look over here!
- CHLOE: Guys...

25:49.936 --> 25:50.819
- Back off.
- Chloe Decker!

25:50.854 --> 25:52.901
- Hey, show me your boobs!
- Hey, show us your boobs, Chloe!

25:52.936 --> 25:55.436
Back off, you mouth-breathing scaven...!

25:55.471 --> 25:58.686
Well, go on then, punch him!
Come on, let's punch them all!

25:58.819 --> 26:00.507
It's not me anymore.

26:00.542 --> 26:03.828
Well, it's still very much me.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.196
You, Friar Tuck,

26:05.231 --> 26:08.823
tell me, is this depravity
really all you want out of life?

26:08.967 --> 26:10.433
Hmm?

26:11.589 --> 26:14.323
I want to win a Pulitzer for photography.

26:14.358 --> 26:15.373
Pulitzer?

26:15.408 --> 26:16.782
Really? Do you hear that, chaps?

26:16.817 --> 26:20.334
Yeah, they don't give out
Pulitzers for nip slips.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.514
(paparazzi clamoring, cameras clicking)

26:27.491 --> 26:30.626
(tires screeching)

26:33.192 --> 26:36.423
- (sighs)
- He's gone.

26:41.541 --> 26:43.745
(Chloe sighs)

26:43.911 --> 26:45.710
(whispers): Oh, boy.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.055
It's not that bad, is it?

26:48.164 --> 26:50.353
Trixie's classmates all have the Internet.

26:50.388 --> 26:51.860
One of them's gonna
figure out that her mom is

26:51.895 --> 26:54.082
the top story on their
favorite gossip site.

26:54.117 --> 26:57.192
She's finally gonna find out
about <i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

26:57.227 --> 26:58.725
- Great.
- If it's any consolation,

26:58.760 --> 26:59.976
you look really good in it.

27:00.011 --> 27:01.544
Thanks.

27:02.541 --> 27:05.589
Why do I feel like you're
cheering me up for even worse news?

27:05.894 --> 27:07.199
Nick's sticking to his story.

27:07.234 --> 27:08.474
It's an open-
and-shut case,

27:08.509 --> 27:11.314
but I can't help it if a rogue detective

27:11.349 --> 27:13.550
won't leave well enough alone.

27:15.776 --> 27:17.262
Oh, you ran the plate number I gave you.

27:17.297 --> 27:18.406
Yes, ma'am, I did.

27:18.441 --> 27:20.633
It was registered to Nick...
one of his company cars.

27:20.668 --> 27:22.526
Like the one that ran Robbie off the road?

27:22.561 --> 27:23.479
Exactly.

27:23.514 --> 27:24.337
Did a little more digging.

27:24.372 --> 27:27.936
Guy's name is Josh Bryant.
He freelances for Nick.

27:27.971 --> 27:29.437
Thanks.

27:31.552 --> 27:33.217
Why are you doing this?

27:33.252 --> 27:35.224
Because I think you're onto something.

27:35.259 --> 27:38.641
So go figure it out
while I buy you some time.

27:38.676 --> 27:41.120
And... be careful.

27:41.155 --> 27:42.762
All right?

27:48.778 --> 27:50.844
(camera clicking)

27:57.305 --> 28:00.806
Oh, sorry. Did I ruin
your creepy little moment?

28:02.556 --> 28:05.598
I am so happy to see you.

28:05.964 --> 28:08.117
I felt so bad about what happened.

28:08.152 --> 28:09.438
I'm a huge fan.

28:09.473 --> 28:11.803
<i>Hot Tub High School</i>
was my favorite growing up.

28:11.838 --> 28:12.876
LUCIFER: Yes, we're really not interested

28:12.911 --> 28:15.040
in your formative spank
bank years, all right?

28:15.153 --> 28:16.802
JOSH: I'm so sorry about what happened.

28:16.837 --> 28:19.237
I would've done something,
but I'm not good with violence.

28:19.273 --> 28:19.859
- (chuckles)
- Mm.

28:19.894 --> 28:22.040
Well, lucky for us, we found you anyhow.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.582
You were looking for me? Why?

28:23.679 --> 28:27.256
Because she wants justice
for Robbie Russell Jr.

28:27.291 --> 28:28.694
What is it you want, Josh?

28:28.729 --> 28:30.949
Hmm?

28:30.984 --> 28:32.926
To be first.

28:32.994 --> 28:34.770
To always be first.

28:34.805 --> 28:36.271
Really?

28:37.564 --> 28:39.190
What, did Nick teach you that?

28:39.326 --> 28:40.759
To be first?

28:41.040 --> 28:42.895
Yeah. I learned a lot working for him.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.162
He's my idol.

28:44.197 --> 28:45.438
He's the best pap out there.

28:45.511 --> 28:48.778
So you took photos of your
idol being arrested for murder?

28:48.813 --> 28:50.742
I didn't know what else to do.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.306
Other than what Nick would've done.

28:52.409 --> 28:54.107
Which is to be first, no matter what.

28:54.142 --> 28:55.533
Of course.

28:55.658 --> 28:57.275
Just a second.

29:03.068 --> 29:04.501
(camera clicks)

29:06.253 --> 29:07.845
You like smoking pot, Josh?

29:07.880 --> 29:10.689
It's for my nerves. I have a prescription.

29:12.392 --> 29:13.642
(camera clicking)

29:13.677 --> 29:14.459
Oh!

29:14.494 --> 29:15.360
Hello.

29:15.395 --> 29:17.362
(camera clicking)

29:18.340 --> 29:20.269
Good timing on that photo.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.701
Just lucky I guess.

29:25.135 --> 29:25.736
(engine starts)

29:25.771 --> 29:29.307
Far be it for me to call someone's
morality into question, but...

29:29.343 --> 29:32.310
I believe that photo was planned.

29:32.346 --> 29:34.796
Yeah.

29:34.964 --> 29:37.664
Makes me wonder what else was.

29:39.586 --> 29:41.519
Look at this.

29:41.555 --> 29:43.262
Celebrity shouting matches,

29:43.297 --> 29:44.355
fistfights.

29:44.390 --> 29:46.766
Josh had the first photo on every one.

29:46.801 --> 29:47.926
It escalates.

29:47.961 --> 29:49.348
Overdose. Suicide.

29:49.383 --> 29:50.819
- Or so it appeared.
- Well, I suppose

29:50.854 --> 29:53.485
the best way to be first is to
know it'll happen beforehand.

29:53.520 --> 29:56.468
So he follows Robbie, intent
on running him off the road,

29:56.503 --> 29:59.604
but doesn't count on his
own car running off as well.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.339
This is cold, premeditated murder.

30:01.374 --> 30:02.711
- Mm.
- Nick's a slimeball.

30:02.746 --> 30:05.377
I just... I don't think he'd go this far.

30:05.485 --> 30:07.616
Which means Josh maybe
convinced him to take the fall.

30:07.651 --> 30:08.885
The question is: why?

30:08.937 --> 30:10.148
Well, who cares?

30:10.183 --> 30:12.442
We know Josh is guilty. Let's punish him.

30:12.527 --> 30:15.230
Ah, I could add an ironic twist,
like I used to when I ran Hell.

30:15.265 --> 30:16.861
Yeah, no, it doesn't work that way,

30:16.896 --> 30:18.024
because I need evidence.

30:18.059 --> 30:19.558
LUCIFER: Well, you have plenty.

30:19.593 --> 30:20.762
Circumstantial.

30:20.797 --> 30:22.853
- I need concrete proof.
- (sighs)

30:22.888 --> 30:23.729
I'm gonna talk to Nick...

30:23.764 --> 30:25.227
Boring, boring, boring, boring!

30:25.262 --> 30:27.358
You don't decide who gets punished and how.

30:27.393 --> 30:30.368
- That's exactly what I do.
- No, no, you don't.

30:30.544 --> 30:32.744
This is how it works, Lucifer.

30:37.247 --> 30:40.114
(sighs)

30:40.680 --> 30:42.271
Whatever speech you have brewing, Maze,

30:42.306 --> 30:44.907
I don't want to hear it.

30:45.085 --> 30:48.221
I think I've said everything I need to.

30:50.753 --> 30:52.220
You're right.

30:52.427 --> 30:53.728
And I agree.

30:53.763 --> 30:55.760
Let's go deliver some punishment.

30:56.162 --> 30:57.294
(chuckles)

31:01.248 --> 31:04.709
We believe Josh may be a
very disturbed individual.

31:04.880 --> 31:05.970
(sighs)

31:06.005 --> 31:07.939
God.

31:07.974 --> 31:09.659
He caused all these?

31:09.694 --> 31:11.952
Yeah. All of them.

31:12.061 --> 31:13.979
I can't believe it. I...

31:15.164 --> 31:16.621
Tell me what really happened, Nick.

31:16.656 --> 31:18.883
(sighs)

31:18.919 --> 31:22.332
I took Josh in when he was 16.

31:22.367 --> 31:23.822
He was a runaway.

31:23.857 --> 31:27.582
He was a little broken.

31:27.715 --> 31:32.530
In him, I saw a little
bit of who I used to be.

31:32.566 --> 31:35.734
At least, I thought I did.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.569
So I took him under my wing.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.038
He was a natural.

31:40.073 --> 31:42.783
Taught him about all the
lines a pap can't cross.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.564
You know, 'cause I just...
I just wanted him to stop

31:45.599 --> 31:47.600
making the same mistakes I did.

31:47.714 --> 31:50.313
- Mm.
- And then, two days ago,

31:50.382 --> 31:52.915
he calls me up, says he's
been in a really bad accident,

31:52.950 --> 31:55.083
and said that he totally understood

31:55.118 --> 31:57.485
everything I was saying now.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.388
But it was too late.

31:59.445 --> 32:01.770
You know, someone was dead.

32:01.879 --> 32:02.990
So you took the fall,

32:03.077 --> 32:06.214
hoping that Josh would
get a chance at a new life.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.416
Yeah.

32:07.493 --> 32:11.036
Nick Hofmeister finally tries to
do something good with his life,

32:11.071 --> 32:13.438
and he gets played.

32:13.529 --> 32:15.398
You must really be enjoying this.

32:15.445 --> 32:17.266
I'm really not.

32:17.331 --> 32:21.111
Believe it or not, I forgive you.

32:21.244 --> 32:23.246
This isn't about you, this isn't about me.

32:23.362 --> 32:24.816
This is about Robbie Russell.

32:24.917 --> 32:27.470
You know, he was a kid who
didn't ask to be famous.

32:27.505 --> 32:31.183
He just wanted to live a normal life.

32:32.493 --> 32:36.105
Nick, if you don't testify,
Josh will do this again.

32:37.124 --> 32:38.830
He'll do it again.

32:38.865 --> 32:41.232
(phone ringing)

32:41.268 --> 32:43.802
Excuse me.

32:43.930 --> 32:46.258
Oh. Just a second.

32:47.094 --> 32:48.257
Hey, Dan, this better be important.

32:48.292 --> 32:50.290
I think Nick's about to talk.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.776
(sighs)

32:51.812 --> 32:54.746
No, I'm not following Josh. Why?

32:55.061 --> 32:56.900
What do you mean he's missing?

33:04.633 --> 33:06.015
Desk Sergeant?

33:06.145 --> 33:07.918
- Yes, Detective?
- Where did Nick Hofmeister go?

33:07.999 --> 33:09.915
- Did somebody get him?
- Why, yes.

33:10.014 --> 33:12.548
It was that tall, handsome British fella.

33:13.271 --> 33:17.345
- Oh, no. I did it, too, didn't I?
- (sighs)

33:21.132 --> 33:23.299
♪ ♪

33:39.734 --> 33:43.071
Oh, I respect what you do, dung beetle.

33:43.106 --> 33:44.764
Much as celebrities hate you,

33:44.799 --> 33:48.401
you know, they need you,
keep you in the limelight.

33:48.645 --> 33:51.346
You're a... a necessarily evil.

33:51.473 --> 33:53.835
Something I understand all too well.

33:53.870 --> 33:56.361
But the-the trouble is
that you tried to change.

33:56.470 --> 33:59.831
Yeah? And you failed spectacularly at it.

33:59.940 --> 34:03.525
Because, well, sometimes
we are what we are,

34:04.263 --> 34:06.630
and we should embrace that.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.775
What are we doing back here exactly?

34:10.811 --> 34:12.067
And do you need me to...?

34:12.250 --> 34:14.002
Maze!

34:14.935 --> 34:17.469
Did you bring me my gift?

34:18.842 --> 34:20.909
(grunting)

34:24.915 --> 34:26.181
(muffled panting)

34:31.502 --> 34:33.768
I'll kill you, you crazy bitch.

34:35.063 --> 34:36.230
Just be polite to the lady.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.467
She isn't your enemy tonight.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.847
What is this?

34:41.931 --> 34:45.909
Right, well, both of you have committed
terrible acts worthy of punishment.

34:45.944 --> 34:48.436
However, you will not receive
said punishment when you die.

34:48.472 --> 34:50.841
It's my fault, really. Sorry.

34:50.965 --> 34:52.891
So I'm here to fix that.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.760
Right now.

34:57.419 --> 34:59.156
Oh. Amateurs.

34:59.242 --> 35:01.612
All right, very well, in
terms you'll understand.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.324
You both get a gun.

35:05.472 --> 35:08.188
Let's see who shoots who first.

35:14.882 --> 35:17.003
What's to stop us from shooting you?

35:17.038 --> 35:20.053
Well, despite the waste
of bullets, let's see.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.483
He's about to rat you out to the police.

35:22.518 --> 35:26.308
And he tricked you into taking the fall
for a murder he committed. (chuckles)

35:26.343 --> 35:27.776
Discuss.

35:29.748 --> 35:32.014
You really did it, didn't you?

35:32.954 --> 35:34.653
You killed people.

35:37.196 --> 35:38.874
You lost your touch, Nick.

35:39.003 --> 35:41.821
All this talk about lines we can't cross.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.758
Nowadays, the only way to be first

35:43.794 --> 35:46.428
is to realize that there <i>is</i> no line.

35:46.463 --> 35:50.665
And you were almost
begging to take the fall.

35:50.701 --> 35:52.769
That one dramatic gesture.

35:52.848 --> 35:55.270
As if that would erase the fact
that you've been a piece of crap

35:55.305 --> 35:57.305
- for the last 30 years.
- You can't do this.

35:57.395 --> 35:59.628
I treated you like a son.

36:00.444 --> 36:02.077
(gun clicks)

36:02.112 --> 36:02.953
(laughs)

36:02.988 --> 36:06.181
Oh, Maze, you fiend.

36:06.361 --> 36:07.965
Even I didn't see that one coming.

36:08.025 --> 36:10.304
You really would've killed me.

36:17.060 --> 36:19.094
- Nick...
- (car approaching)

36:19.265 --> 36:21.496
I made a mistake, okay? I realize that now.

36:21.531 --> 36:22.950
- (car door opens)
- And I'm sorry.

36:23.055 --> 36:25.667
CHLOE: Stop! Don't shoot him!

36:25.726 --> 36:28.370
LUCIFER: Detective, you're
interrupting my punishment.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.654
You, don't talk. You're lucky
I figured out your insane,

36:30.689 --> 36:32.528
ironic punishment before anyone got killed.

36:32.602 --> 36:35.411
Nick, you tried to do some good,

36:35.446 --> 36:37.134
to help someone. Don't throw it all away.

36:37.222 --> 36:39.684
Nick, embrace who you really
are. Stop fighting it. Come on.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.304
Don't listen to him,
Nick. You tried to change.

36:42.339 --> 36:43.639
Yeah.

36:43.741 --> 36:45.049
- And look what happened.
- Yeah.

36:45.084 --> 36:46.819
You screwed up, but you
know what? It's okay.

36:46.923 --> 36:48.926
You tried to change.
That's what's important.

36:48.961 --> 36:50.994
Humans.

36:51.215 --> 36:53.716
Fascinating, aren't they?

36:54.425 --> 36:56.002
Do you know, perhaps
they're onto something.

36:56.054 --> 36:59.252
Nick... don't.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.818
I was surprised to hear from you, Lucifer.

37:16.909 --> 37:19.754
Well, not as surprised as I was.

37:19.790 --> 37:21.956
But I wanted to tell you you were right.

37:21.992 --> 37:24.160
Hmm. Is that a joke?

37:24.311 --> 37:26.244
(chuckles) No, I wish it were.

37:26.430 --> 37:29.397
But, no, you were right, and I was wrong.

37:33.742 --> 37:35.150
So you'll return to Hell?

37:35.272 --> 37:37.172
What? No!

37:37.207 --> 37:38.796
That is absurd.

37:38.899 --> 37:41.143
No, you're right that I've
changed in my time here,

37:41.257 --> 37:44.158
and that I have absolutely
no control over it.

37:44.884 --> 37:46.530
And you know what?

37:49.039 --> 37:52.336
That feels positively thrilling.

37:52.707 --> 37:54.890
You asked me here to tell me that?

37:55.253 --> 37:56.211
No, no, no, I thought

37:56.309 --> 37:58.782
I'd use you to remedy a
situation that I've mishandled,

37:58.872 --> 38:01.439
and annoy you in the process.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.827
Kill two birds with one
prayer sort of thing, hmm?

38:03.934 --> 38:06.634
Luci...

38:06.670 --> 38:08.536
you should've taken the offer.

38:08.572 --> 38:11.239
Oh.

38:12.242 --> 38:14.375
(wings flapping)

38:19.349 --> 38:20.849
(groans)

38:21.518 --> 38:22.350
(gasps)

38:26.323 --> 38:28.642
You're looking for someone?

38:28.741 --> 38:30.140
(gasps)

38:30.293 --> 38:33.061
But...

38:33.124 --> 38:34.896
you were just over there.

38:35.005 --> 38:38.406
That's... that's impossible.

38:43.212 --> 38:46.172
(indistinct police radio chatter)

38:46.207 --> 38:48.307
(siren whoops)

38:57.199 --> 38:58.684
Yes?

38:59.095 --> 39:00.823
I saw Nick pull the trigger.

39:00.956 --> 39:03.489
I heard the gunshot, but Josh wasn't shot.

39:03.566 --> 39:05.920
Did you put blanks in the guns? Like...

39:05.955 --> 39:08.393
Was this some staged thing to
get a confession out of Josh?

39:08.428 --> 39:11.086
That's probably more plausible
to you than my angelic brother

39:11.159 --> 39:13.337
slowing time while I pluck
a bullet out of thin air,

39:13.434 --> 39:15.701
isn't it?

39:16.103 --> 39:18.237
Even with all that,

39:18.273 --> 39:20.706
you were standing right in front of me.

39:20.742 --> 39:23.109
I blink, and you're here.

39:23.144 --> 39:24.911
Is there a question there, Detective?

39:24.946 --> 39:27.282
You... (sighs)

39:27.381 --> 39:29.367
You know exactly what I'm asking you.

39:29.445 --> 39:31.938
And you know exactly what I'll answer.

39:32.850 --> 39:34.387
You know, um...

39:35.072 --> 39:38.063
it's quite fun, this
police malarkey, isn't it?

39:38.633 --> 39:41.027
TRIXIE: Are we going
to watch a movie, Mommy?

39:41.062 --> 39:43.429
CHLOE: No, babe, I just wanted
to talk to you about something.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.632
So, before I was a cop,

39:46.708 --> 39:48.669
I was an actress.

39:48.704 --> 39:50.390
And I was in a movie.

39:50.478 --> 39:53.607
And... it was this movie.

39:53.693 --> 39:58.070
In the movie, I do some very silly things.

39:58.105 --> 39:59.777
Things that, uh,

39:59.812 --> 40:03.018
maybe some of your friends
might tease you about.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.320
But it is what it is,

40:05.417 --> 40:08.430
and-and that's not me anymore, okay?

40:09.636 --> 40:10.923
(whispers): I know.

40:10.959 --> 40:11.958
Hmm?

40:12.299 --> 40:14.575
I've seen this before, Mommy.

40:15.403 --> 40:17.400
You have? Where?

40:17.435 --> 40:20.271
I have the Internet.

40:20.399 --> 40:21.832
Oh, right.

40:21.867 --> 40:25.102
This isn't even in HD.

40:25.507 --> 40:28.241
Mm. Hmm.

40:29.112 --> 40:31.032
Well, what'd you think?

40:31.212 --> 40:33.410
I thought it's hilarious!

40:33.996 --> 40:34.914
You did?

40:34.985 --> 40:36.985
My favorite part is when
you ate too much cake,

40:37.115 --> 40:39.452
and then you puked in that cute guy's hair.

40:39.487 --> 40:40.771
(laughs)

40:40.892 --> 40:42.984
That part is really funny.

40:43.359 --> 40:46.817
Then you stop, and we think it's all over.

40:46.852 --> 40:48.037
Yeah.

40:48.215 --> 40:49.512
But then...

40:49.732 --> 40:51.564
- Blah! Blah!
- Oh.

40:51.599 --> 40:54.066
(laughs)

40:54.321 --> 40:55.346
Sorry, Mommy.

40:55.381 --> 40:56.616
Didn't mean to hurt you.

40:56.694 --> 40:59.095
You didn't hurt me, baby. I'm fine.

40:59.210 --> 41:01.004
It's gonna get better soon.

41:01.047 --> 41:03.637
I hope the guy who hurt
you got in lots of trouble.

41:03.696 --> 41:06.484
You know, I should go see him.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.749
So, the Devil did a good deed today.

41:09.784 --> 41:11.250
(laughs): Oh. Hmm.

41:11.323 --> 41:13.325
- There's no need to call it that.
- (chuckles)

41:13.360 --> 41:14.986
I enjoyed every minute of it.

41:15.021 --> 41:18.289
(laughs) You know what I mean.

41:18.553 --> 41:19.952
Mm.

41:20.018 --> 41:23.419
You know, I'm so very used to
being in control of everything.

41:23.698 --> 41:26.832
Not knowing what's gonna come next is...

41:27.027 --> 41:28.634
Can be scary.

41:28.739 --> 41:31.671
No. No, I'm finding it
quite exhilarating, actually.

41:31.731 --> 41:33.239
- Hmm.
- (chuckles)

41:34.321 --> 41:35.974
I think you were right, by the way.

41:36.009 --> 41:37.091
About what?

41:37.185 --> 41:40.746
That it may be a "who" that's changing me.

41:41.244 --> 41:46.312
But now that begs the
question: what do I do with her?

41:46.347 --> 41:48.517
WOMAN: <i>I have to warn you,
he's heavily medicated.</i>

41:48.612 --> 41:51.090
I doubt he'll be able to string
two words together right now,

41:51.125 --> 41:53.814
much less have a conversation.

41:53.885 --> 41:56.018
Thanks.

41:58.700 --> 42:00.666
Hey, Jimmy.

42:01.873 --> 42:04.502
So this is where you ended up, huh?

42:04.537 --> 42:08.054
I was so wrapped up in
recovery, I forgot to come visit.

42:08.089 --> 42:10.496
You know, from when you shot me.

42:13.214 --> 42:14.346
(sighs)

42:14.779 --> 42:16.351
I have to ask you something, Jimmy,

42:16.386 --> 42:18.720
about that day.

42:24.754 --> 42:27.040
What happened to you, Jimmy?

42:27.223 --> 42:29.624
What happened with Lucifer?

42:32.182 --> 42:33.926
Lucifer?

42:34.067 --> 42:35.151
What happened when you shot at me?

42:35.186 --> 42:37.105
- Is he here?! Tell me he's not here!
- No.

42:37.140 --> 42:39.337
No, Jimmy, he's not here.
He's not here, Jimmy.

42:39.372 --> 42:40.539
I know he's here.

42:40.575 --> 42:43.101
I can't get away. I
can't get away from him!

42:44.178 --> 42:45.911
Jimmy, you're safe here.

42:48.449 --> 42:49.771
- (crying)
- You're safe.

42:49.806 --> 42:51.677
No, I'm not safe! None of us are!

42:51.750 --> 42:54.390
- He's just a man, Jimmy.
- You don't get it, do you?

42:54.425 --> 42:56.889
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

42:57.010 --> 42:58.290
He's the Devil!

42:58.326 --> 43:01.193
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

43:02.535 --> 43:07.535
