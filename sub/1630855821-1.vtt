01:37.166 --> 01:38.750
[Luke] There you are.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.500
Stop hiding.
Come back in, I want to introduce you.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.875
- Come here.
- Okay.

01:43.666 --> 01:46.916
Uncle J, this is the woman
I can't stop talking about.

01:46.916 --> 01:50.458
- Emily, a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.458
Open bar. I'm buying.

01:52.458 --> 01:53.750
- [Luke] Nice.
- [Emily] Oh.

01:53.750 --> 01:57.000
So, Mister Ivy League has
the best-looking girl in the room.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.583
- She's got other things going for her.
- Just one or two.

02:00.583 --> 02:02.291
If this guy gives you any kind of trouble,

02:02.291 --> 02:03.833
just let me know, I'll sort him out...

02:03.833 --> 02:06.041
- I will keep that in mind.
- [Luke] Really?

02:06.041 --> 02:08.583
Lock it in before she loses interest.

02:08.583 --> 02:10.458
Wow, you're so romantic, Theo.

02:10.458 --> 02:12.416
Well, romance wears off.

02:12.416 --> 02:14.458
Says the guy on his wedding day.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.375
Go find your bride and kiss her

she fucked her whole life up.

Stop hassling your brother. Get over here.

02:25.458 --> 02:26.666
You got the title.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.583
- Oh, God, not her.
- What?

02:28.583 --> 02:29.541
Hi.

Let's go dance with her.

or you just gonna stare?

- Just, just stare.
- Okay.

- Oh, my God.

03:45.833 --> 03:47.583
Jesus Christ.

03:47.583 --> 03:50.041
It looks like you slaughtered a chicken.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.750
How did that happen?

03:51.750 --> 03:53.958
What were you doing in here?

03:55.833 --> 03:58.375
[Luke] Oh, shit. Okay.

Do you think your mom has a tampon? Fuck.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.875
We have to take the photos still.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.083
Do you think this is a problem?

04:06.083 --> 04:07.708
Oh, my God!

04:08.916 --> 04:10.500
I mean, now my family will

04:10.500 --> 04:12.541

Shit.

04:45.583 --> 04:46.583
Marry me?

04:50.125 --> 04:51.125
Luke.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm serious.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.250
You're drunk.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.625
Yeah, but I was sober when I bought it.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.750
I fucking love you so fucking much.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
[Luke] Mwah!

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
I mean it.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.833
You're everything to me.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.625
And I promise...

05:19.666 --> 05:20.833
if we do this,

05:21.833 --> 05:23.250
we'll do it right, okay?

[ballad plays at party]

05:30.958 --> 05:32.458
What do you think?

05:32.458 --> 05:34.083
[exhaling] Oh, my God.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.833
You know, just the rest of your life.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.041
Okay.

Okay?

- Oh, shit, my shoe.
- You couldn't walk in them anyway.

06:21.833 --> 06:22.791
Come on.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.500
We look like we're fleeing
the scene of a murder.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.833
- I hope we don't get arrested.

- [Quinn] Garden.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.125
[Rory] How much do I owe you?

10:30.125 --> 10:32.458
[Quinn] Don't worry about it.
Just bring the blonde.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.958
Can't work out if I'm attracted
or repulsed by her.

10:34.958 --> 10:38.083
- [Quinn] For one night, who cares?
- Jesus, man.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.708
[Quinn chuckles smugly]

10:40.375 --> 10:42.458
- How we doing?
- Just emailed you.

- [Quinn] Luke?
- [Luke] Moments away, Cap'n.

10:44.958 --> 10:47.916
[Quinn] Pretty good mood for a Monday.
You cut loose this weekend?

10:48.500 --> 10:49.875
[Luke] Something like that.

10:50.791 --> 10:53.833
[Emily] <i>Look, Rory,
I think it's undervalued by 20%.</i>

10:53.833 --> 10:56.083
People are going off the hype
of the competing line

10:56.083 --> 10:57.500
but no one's watching Congress.

10:57.500 --> 11:01.333
If this new law passes,
it'll squeeze Vent's position overseas,

11:02.833 --> 11:05.250

the last few months to get up to code.

- A quarter monopoly for new businesses.
- In the fastest growing markets.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.916
- I say we increase by 15%.
- Easy, cowboy.

11:11.916 --> 11:13.916
They struck gold
with the new product line.

11:13.916 --> 11:17.041
They beat everybody. There were lines
around the block on the release date.

11:17.041 --> 11:18.333
What about TOC?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.625
I think the CEO's overstating
what he thinks they'll earn.

11:20.625 --> 11:23.125
I think they miss their figures. Look...

11:23.125 --> 11:26.041
Word is they've got two empty suits
that won't make it till Christmas.

11:26.041 --> 11:29.125
Plus, they dropped the ball
on their launch date last spring.

or I'll be looking for a new analyst.

Clean that shit up.

- [Henry] You think they'll sue?
- It's not worth the headache.

30:10.333 --> 30:11.791
Oh, it's like that.

30:11.791 --> 30:13.708
I'm kidding. I'm joking.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.583
Come here.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.708
Let's celebrate.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.833
I'm so fucking proud of you.

30:24.750 --> 30:26.166
You know that, right?

30:27.583 --> 30:28.416
Hm.

30:31.041 --> 30:35.833
Um, could I get another round
and a vodka soda for the lady?

30:39.166 --> 30:42.250
How you feeling? You okay? Feeling good?

30:42.791 --> 30:45.875
Yeah, you know, I'm still processing it.

30:45.875 --> 30:48.625
Embrace it. It's really exciting.

30:49.833 --> 30:50.833
Cheers.

30:51.916 --> 30:52.916
Cheers.

30:57.958 --> 30:58.791
[exhales]

31:03.916 --> 31:05.083
Campbell didn't...?

31:07.583 --> 31:09.375
He didn't try anything, right?

31:13.208 --> 31:16.958
- I would've told you if he did.
- I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

31:20.625 --> 31:22.375
I know. I'm sorry.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.416
[cell phone buzzing]

31:29.250 --> 31:30.708
- Jesus.
- What?

31:31.625 --> 31:34.333
My mom is already planning
the fucking wedding.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.791
Your parents been harassing you?

31:36.791 --> 31:37.875
[sighs]

31:37.875 --> 31:39.500
I haven't told them yet.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.833
Can I get a glass of water?
And one for her.

31:43.833 --> 31:47.875
You know what? I'm gonna just
settle up and get the check, actually.

31:50.791 --> 31:52.791
- Keep the change.
- [bartender] Thank you.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.125
[Luke clears throat]

31:55.875 --> 31:58.166
I'm gonna help you get the next promotion.

32:01.208 --> 32:04.000
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.083
I'm serious.

32:05.083 --> 32:07.500
Who knows
when the next one's gonna be.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.583
I do.

32:09.416 --> 32:11.833
The way Campbell was talking about Rory,

32:11.833 --> 32:14.708
it seems like he's on the chopping block.

32:14.708 --> 32:17.583
If we play our cards right,
I can help you take his spot.

32:17.583 --> 32:22.125
Hey, hey, I appreciate that.
I'll make it on my own.

32:22.125 --> 32:25.208
I know, but it doesn't mean
that I can't help.

32:25.208 --> 32:29.375
Look, this situation isn't what
we expected, but it shouldn't be for long.

32:29.375 --> 32:32.333
I really think
that we can turn this in our favor

32:32.333 --> 32:35.541
and find a way to move you up
at the next opportunity.

32:35.541 --> 32:36.958
You don't have to, like...

32:36.958 --> 32:40.333
I want to. I'll highlight your trade recs
to Campbell.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.083
I'll give you credit
where Quinn never has.

[office phones ringing]

32:50.583 --> 32:51.791
[keyboards clicking]

32:53.166 --> 32:56.250
[Dax] He's a great investor, sure,
but he's fucking disorganized

32:56.250 --> 32:58.958
and he's got no time-management skills.

32:58.958 --> 33:01.708
I don't know how he survived
being an analyst.

33:01.708 --> 33:04.291
[Emily] How much of the float
does management own?

33:05.250 --> 33:07.250
And how much are they buying back?

33:08.583 --> 33:11.583
Let me dig in. I'll call you later. Bye.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.166
[overlapping office chatter]

33:23.083 --> 33:25.583
Look into this,
let me know what you think.

33:27.041 --> 33:29.250
I'm still working on the three
from before.

33:29.791 --> 33:31.541
Okay. Make this one the priority.

33:31.541 --> 33:32.916
[laughs] Okay.

33:33.625 --> 33:35.833
Do you still want 'em
by the end of the day?

33:39.500 --> 33:41.166
Do you want this or not?

33:43.666 --> 33:44.666
[taps tablet]

[vacuum whirring]

33:57.750 --> 33:59.333
[keyboard clacking]

34:29.708 --> 34:33.166
You were right to flag it. They could see
a pretty decent return next week.

34:33.166 --> 34:37.375
There's a couple potential bumps
from other developers but no red flags.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.291
[playful knock]

34:38.291 --> 34:40.916
Hey, we're gonna go grab a drink.
Do you wanna join?

34:41.541 --> 34:44.875
Have you heard of Miro? Sequoia backed.

34:44.875 --> 34:49.083
It went public last month.
Some say it's an overhyped unicorn

34:49.083 --> 34:53.208
but Luke sourced it, ran the numbers
and thinks it can reel in sizable returns.

34:53.208 --> 34:56.125
- For an overhyped unicorn.
- When they announced their plans--

34:56.125 --> 34:59.041
Do you know how much
Luke's last unicorn cost us?

34:59.916 --> 35:01.083
Fifteen million.

35:05.708 --> 35:08.333
[Campbell] Put it under a microscope
before you move.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.250
Of course.

35:11.041 --> 35:14.458
But he's here to support your vision,
not steer it.

35:18.666 --> 35:19.750
You coming or not?

35:21.083 --> 35:23.708
- First round's on me.
- [Paul] Nice answer.

35:23.708 --> 35:26.666
[tense reverberating music plays]

[train screeching]

35:44.000 --> 35:45.375
[car honking]

35:46.875 --> 35:49.625
[Paul] The moron puts in
the wrong number of shares.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.333
It cost him 38 million.

35:51.333 --> 35:54.250
Griffin made the guy write
the correct number on the wall

35:54.250 --> 35:56.416
every hour for the next six weeks.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.083
We didn't finish our conversation earlier.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.500
- About?
- Luke.

36:03.416 --> 36:06.958
I'm sure Quinn never told you,
but he shorted Brick last month,

36:06.958 --> 36:09.791
making up three times for that one loss.

36:11.958 --> 36:15.166
He's made great progress
analyzing performance.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.916
He's sharp, he works hard.

36:16.916 --> 36:18.250
So does my gardener.

36:19.291 --> 36:21.708
- He was a favor.
- A favor?

36:21.708 --> 36:24.375
[Campbell] A friend of mine
pushed him on me.

36:24.375 --> 36:27.416
It'll just make it easier
when he quits on his own.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.166
Well, he's... he's valuable to me.

36:33.916 --> 36:35.125
So is my gardener.

36:35.791 --> 36:39.916
He's got good instincts and made us
some money, but he's not you.

36:40.791 --> 36:42.166
He'll get the message.

36:43.333 --> 36:44.333
They all do.

36:46.416 --> 36:47.416
[puts glass down]

37:47.583 --> 37:50.333
<i>You can let other people
dictate your narrative</i>

37:51.041 --> 37:53.791
<i>or you can choose one that you own.</i>

37:54.333 --> 37:56.166
<i>You have to know
that everybody has the ability</i>

37:56.166 --> 37:58.875

37:58.875 --> 38:01.250

38:01.250 --> 38:05.166

on their own version of reality.</i>

38:05.166 --> 38:07.666

Em, you're using the wrong one.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.000
Oh, fuck.

38:20.541 --> 38:21.541
Sorry.

38:26.208 --> 38:28.791
- Cocktails were, like, $40 each.
- Mm.

38:28.791 --> 38:30.541
Three sips and you were done.

38:31.500 --> 38:35.583
If we ever want to get out of finance,
we should open a bar like that.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.541
[opening fridge] I am starving.

38:40.458 --> 38:42.250
[indecisive] Mmm...

38:42.250 --> 38:44.250
Were these from last week?

38:45.291 --> 38:46.291
I don't know.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.583
Oh, my God.

38:57.583 --> 38:59.000
[talk continues on laptop]

39:06.583 --> 39:08.708
I'm sorry Campbell cut you down like that.

39:10.583 --> 39:12.833
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

39:12.833 --> 39:16.166
The loss was Quinn's call, not mine,
but I know it's not personal.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.583
It's just his, you know,
tough love approach.

39:18.583 --> 39:19.958
[talk continues on laptop]

39:33.958 --> 39:36.458
It's a lot of money for a pat on the back.

You already know a lot.

39:39.666 --> 39:40.875
Not necessarily.

39:42.125 --> 39:43.166
Guy's an asshole.

39:44.666 --> 39:47.333
But you don't get far by being nice,
you know.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.958

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.458
all these chicks to the locker room
and put bags on their heads.

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:52.333
Then they'd bring the freshmen
that just made the hockey team.

01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:56.375
They'd match the guys with a girl,
then have 'em fuck 'em in a line.

01:04:56.375 --> 01:04:58.208
No, no, it gets better.

01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:00.958
So, after this one freshman, he finishes,

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.875
pulls the bag off the head
of this chick he just railed...

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:06.750
It's his fucking sister.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:09.458
- [Paul] Shut the fuck up.
- It's his fucking sister!

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:13.791
- Swear to fucking God.
- It's fucking sick.

01:05:13.791 --> 01:05:14.875
[Paul] Fuck me.

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:20.416
- Lighten up. It's a dumb story.
- She gets it, she's cool.

01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:28.000
- What happened to the sister fucker?
- Left the fucking school.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.333
Left the earth and killed himself.

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:32.666
[Arjun] It reminds me
of these twins at Brown.

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:33.875
- [Rory] Uh-oh.
- [Paul] God.

01:05:33.875 --> 01:05:37.000
[Arjun] The guy used the Doritos bag
as a condom.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.375
[Paul] Oh!

01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:40.750
[Arjun] She couldn't even
tell the difference.

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.083
[Paul, laughing] How fucking drunk
can you be?

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:45.625
- [Rory] Were the chips in the bag?
- [Paul] Jesus!

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:47.916
[Rory] No. Serious fucking question, man.

01:05:47.916 --> 01:05:50.291
Well, at least she was getting fucked.

01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:53.458
- [Paul] Whoa, Jesus.
- Well. Okay.

01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:56.666
Enough with the bedtime stories
that are boring me.

01:05:56.666 --> 01:05:59.500
[Rory] Shit,
somebody switched the light on.

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.833
Yeah, all right. Let's go.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:05.000
Hey. Over here.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.041
Let's get some fucking ass.

01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:08.333
[Arjun] There she is!

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:11.125
- [Emily] Woo!
- [Rory] Yeah, all right!

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:13.875
- [Rory] Yeah.
- [Arjun] My God.

01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:15.000
[Emily] Hi.

01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:17.916
- [Paul] Hello.
- [Emily] Hey, what's your name?

01:06:17.916 --> 01:06:20.916
- Come closer, I won't bite.
- [Rory] Woo! All right.

01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:22.916
[music continues]

01:06:24.875 --> 01:06:26.708
[Arjun] No. Don't stop. Make it hurt.

01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:29.541
- [Paul] Got a little candy there.
- [Rory] Anybody peckish?

01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:30.750
[Arjun] Cheers, cheers.

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:33.416
Did you know there's a vegan strip club
in Portland?

01:06:33.416 --> 01:06:36.291
[Rory] Do they serve carrots
with a side of pussy?

01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:40.041
No, you just don't eat the pussy.
Just stick to the carrots.

01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:42.250
[Rory] I eat carrots,
they're good for your eyes.

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:44.041
[knocking on door]

01:06:45.541 --> 01:06:46.833
[knocking on door]

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.458
[banging on door]

01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:56.250
You're using the wrong key again.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.208
[Emily laughs]

01:06:57.208 --> 01:06:58.291
Fuck.

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:01.041
All of these keys look the same.

01:07:01.666 --> 01:07:04.166
I don't even know where they're from.

01:07:04.166 --> 01:07:08.083
Like, why are all these fucking keys
hanging off my fucking ring?

01:07:08.083 --> 01:07:11.791
I stopped to get a slice,
and then I pass this taco stand,

01:07:11.791 --> 01:07:14.750
and then I didn't know
if I wanted pizza or tacos.

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:17.291
And then this guy was eating a falafel

01:07:17.875 --> 01:07:19.333
and I thought,

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:21.875
"Fuck, how great is New York?"

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:25.041
I mean, you can have whatever you want,
all the time.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.083
What is all this shit in my purse?

01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:31.583
I had a bite, but if you want some,
it's really fucking delicious.

01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:32.583
[laughs]

01:07:32.583 --> 01:07:35.416
Rory was telling this scandal
from college.

01:07:35.416 --> 01:07:38.125
He said that the seniors
of the hockey team

01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:41.083
would line up these girls
in the locker room,

01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:43.166
put bags over their heads,

01:07:43.166 --> 01:07:46.375
and bring in the freshmen
that had just made the team.

01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:50.958
They'd match each of the guys
to a different girl

01:07:50.958 --> 01:07:52.875
and they'd make them fuck them,

01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:54.291
all in a line.

01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:57.541
- I'm gonna go back to bed.
- Wait, wait.

01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:59.583
You haven't heard the punch line yet.

01:07:59.583 --> 01:08:02.166
After this freshman finished,

01:08:02.166 --> 01:08:04.333
he pulls off the bag

01:08:04.333 --> 01:08:07.125
and he sees that it's his sister.

01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:11.000
[breathlessly]
He's been fucking his sister.

01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:15.208
Oh, my God.

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:16.375
What the...?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.125
Christ, have a sense of humor.

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:23.375
Jesus, you're so stiff.

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.541
Speaking of stiff...

01:08:28.083 --> 01:08:30.416
- Don't. Emily.
- Come on. What?

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:32.375
- Not now, okay?
- I want it.

01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:36.208
- Are you gonna make me beg?
- Don't. Emily, stop.

01:08:36.208 --> 01:08:37.375
Okay.

01:08:37.375 --> 01:08:38.458
Look,

01:08:39.791 --> 01:08:42.625
I promise to help your career

01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:44.000
if you eat my pussy.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.291
Jesus Christ.

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:46.416
[snort laughs]

01:08:49.916 --> 01:08:51.208
You're drunk.

01:08:51.208 --> 01:08:53.625
You're-- You're pathetic, so...

01:08:55.416 --> 01:08:56.791
What'd you say to me?

01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.208
What the fuck did you just say to me?

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:02.416
- I didn't mean--
- You're fucking pathetic.

01:09:02.416 --> 01:09:05.458
Prancing around
like the newest member of Beta Phi?

01:09:05.458 --> 01:09:07.041
Drinking like there's no tomorrow?

01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:09.250
Does that make you feel good? Powerful?

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:10.916
Like one of the boys?

01:09:10.916 --> 01:09:15.000
Because I'll tell you something,
you don't look like one of the boys.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.458
You look like the hooker they paid
to keep them company.

01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:27.083

01:09:53.208 --> 01:09:54.291
[Paul] Ready?

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:58.041
[Dax] The outlook calls for low growth

01:09:58.041 --> 01:09:59.916
and rising labor
and materials input costs.

01:09:59.916 --> 01:10:03.125
Too much pressure on margins.
We should dump it.

01:10:03.708 --> 01:10:07.625
[Arjun] Everyone is selling in a panic.
It's time to fucking buy, Dax.

01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:11.291
- [Arjun] Fuck.
- [Dax] What?

01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:13.625
[Arjun] Nothing.
My head's fucking killing me.

01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:15.291
I got home at three last night.

01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:19.375
Hope I didn't fuck myself
buying B&O this morning.

01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:21.416
[resonant forboding music plays]

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:32.958
Hey, speaking of which,
check out these photos.

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:37.083
- Shit. Is that Emily?
- Right?

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:39.833
- Oh, my God.
- She was on one last night.

01:10:39.833 --> 01:10:42.166
Girl dropped like five or six grand.

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:45.375
- She's a freak.
- [Dax] She's such a fucking freak.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:48.541
A fucking freak.
I fucking told you she's an animal.

01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:50.666
All right, tell them
I'll be in a minute. Thank you.

01:10:50.666 --> 01:10:51.916
Yo, check out Rory.

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:54.333
[Arjun] Oh, fuck.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.166
[Dax] Did you see this coming?

01:10:57.166 --> 01:11:00.583
[Arjun] Nobody's seen this fucking coming.
The fucking golden boy?

01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:03.000
[Dax] Fucking get the napkins.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.708
Oh no, it's coming.

01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:08.416
[Arjun] It's a good-looking office, though.

01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:11.125
- Once they wipe the tears away.
- [Dax] Yeah, yeah.

01:11:11.125 --> 01:11:12.208
[laughter]

01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:18.916
[man on phone] <i>They had a rough start.</i>

01:11:18.916 --> 01:11:21.458
<i>They didn't exactly hit it out the gate.</i>

01:11:21.458 --> 01:11:23.416
<i>Even the slogan became a meme.</i>

01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:26.666
<i>And the marketing department
fucked up the launch.</i>

01:11:26.666 --> 01:11:30.791
<i>But I think their earnings
will fall far less than people expect.</i>

01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:33.708
<i>- A pleasant surprise will lift the stock.</i>
- You need to pitch Campbell.

01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:35.541
<i>- I'm sorry?</i>
- Sell him on me.

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:37.833
It needs to happen now.

01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:40.666
<i>You want me to pitch
to Campbell directly?</i>

01:11:40.666 --> 01:11:44.916
- I'm sorry. Can we call you back in ten?
<i>- Sure, but I should get moving.</i>

01:11:46.416 --> 01:11:48.125
- What was that?
- Campbell needs to hear from you.

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:50.041
- Okay--
- It needs to happen now.

01:11:53.416 --> 01:11:56.500
How about an apology
before you ask for a favor?

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.250
The hooker comment
didn't sit well last night.

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:02.291
- This is time-sensitive.
- So are my feelings.

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.541
Are you gonna pitch him or not?

01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:08.250
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- Why?

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:09.750
He's not in that headspace.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:10.916
- Put him in it.
- How?

01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:13.666
I don't know. You must have
some influence, you made him your buddy.

01:12:13.666 --> 01:12:17.291
- He's not my buddy, he's my boss.
- That's hard to tell.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:21.166
- You know it's just a game.
- Mm-hm. You play it very well.

01:12:21.166 --> 01:12:25.125
- That doesn't sound like a compliment.
- This thing was your idea.

01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:28.375
Yes, and I've tried,
but Campbell won't budge, okay?

01:12:28.375 --> 01:12:32.125
- You've got a target on your back.
- The fuck does that mean?

01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:35.916
- But Avenue is taking resumes.
- Are you fucking serious?

01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:37.708
- Luke.
- I'm not quitting.

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.000
We both can't keep working here.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.125
- It's killing us.
- If it bothers you, you can leave.

01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:46.041
Are you serious,
I'm the one with something to lose.

01:12:46.041 --> 01:12:47.041
And I'm not?

01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:50.000
Cutting your losses
isn't the same as giving up.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.458
This is our only way out.
There are other firms you can go to.

01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:55.875
I don't give a shit. I want this firm.

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:58.125
Maybe this firm doesn't want you.

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:01.250
Like fuck it doesn't.

01:13:05.958 --> 01:13:06.958
Luke.

01:13:08.833 --> 01:13:10.625
- Sixty seconds.
- When I'm done.

01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:11.958
Nope. Now.

01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:15.083
I'll call you back.

01:13:18.208 --> 01:13:20.333
Sixty. Go.

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:22.958
April 6th, 2009.

01:13:22.958 --> 01:13:24.583
Spring semester at Yale.

01:13:24.583 --> 01:13:27.625
You came in
and gave a 40-minute presentation.

01:13:27.625 --> 01:13:31.666
No sugarcoating, no aspirational bullshit,
you just laid it all out.

01:13:31.666 --> 01:13:35.041
First level thinking, second level
thinking, the traps, the hacks.

01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:37.791
You taught me more about finance
in 40 minutes

01:13:37.791 --> 01:13:40.583
than I learned in two years at Goldman.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:43.666
I never knew what I wanted to do
until I met you.

01:13:44.583 --> 01:13:47.875
The minute you finished,
I went straight to my counselor,

01:13:47.875 --> 01:13:51.333
changed my courses,
my diet, my wardrobe.

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:55.125
I did everything I could
to follow in your footsteps

01:13:55.125 --> 01:13:59.458
because all I've ever wanted
is to work for you, learn from you,

01:13:59.458 --> 01:14:01.666
and one day, become you.

01:14:01.666 --> 01:14:04.375
I never believed in anything growing up.

01:14:04.375 --> 01:14:07.000
This firm has become my religion.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.583
You have become my God.

01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:13.208
I promise, you give me this opportunity,

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:15.458
I will give you everything I got.

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:17.708
Take this as my oath, my loyalty.

01:25:16.916 --> 01:25:19.083
Who the fuck are you to judge me?

01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:21.916
To think I'm nothing?
You're fucking nothing.

01:25:22.458 --> 01:25:24.791
You think you fell
into one successful company,

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:28.833
that gives you the right to step on people
and treat 'em like shit?

01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:31.208
- Luke, stop this.
- You crossed the line.

01:25:31.208 --> 01:25:33.041
No, no, no, no! No! No!

01:25:33.541 --> 01:25:34.500
You did!

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:38.000

so many times before it bites back!

You think I need you to get ahead,
to make something of myself?

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.500
I don't need you people.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:54.708

and my own merit,

your fucking company into the ground!

[Emily] Jesus Christ.

01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:02.625
[Luke] You act like you've got it all
under control.

01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:05.041
You can't keep
your own fucking house in order.

01:26:05.041 --> 01:26:09.125
You think your employees respect you?
You think fear cultivates respect?

01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:11.958
They don't respect you,
they fucking hate you!

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:15.291
Right? Right, everybody? They lie to you!

01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:19.750
In fact, your rising star
is the biggest liar of them all!

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:22.958

company policy for the last two years

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:25.416

01:26:26.458 --> 01:26:29.125
Don't worry,
it wasn't always a casting couch.

01:26:29.125 --> 01:26:32.291
She did promise to promote me
if I ate her fucking pussy!

01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:35.208
Oh, security.

01:26:35.208 --> 01:26:37.666
- [guard] Come on. Let's go.
- [Luke] I'm leaving.

01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:40.416

You want to sabotage your career?

But you won't drag me down with you.

of our fucking engagement party?

01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:15.250
You know, if you want to break up,
then do it to my face,

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:17.041

- Have you heard from Luke?

01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:29.583
<i>- Yeah, he left 20 minutes ago.</i>
- Where'd he go?

01:27:29.583 --> 01:27:30.583
[scoffs]

01:27:30.583 --> 01:27:33.625
- That was a question!
<i>- To your engagement party.</i>

01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:37.125
<i>Where the fuck do you expect him to go,
fucking Disneyland?</i>

01:27:37.125 --> 01:27:38.958
He said he was still going?

01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:41.500
<i>What do you mean? He came by to change.</i>

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.125

- Fuck.

01:27:44.666 --> 01:27:47.583
<i>- Em? Are you good?</i>
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

<i>Hey, what's the problem?</i>

01:27:49.416 --> 01:27:51.666
Problem? The problem?

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:55.625
The problem is that your brother
is a fucking psychopath!

01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:57.166

[Emily's mother] There she is.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:19.416
Jesus, Emily.

01:28:19.416 --> 01:28:22.875
I got a photographer.
The least you could do is comb your hair.

01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:24.666
- Where's Luke?
- The end of the bar.

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:28.750
Take my lipstick and go to the bathroom.
Emily, you look like shit.

01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:31.083
- So happy for both of you.
- Congratulations.

01:28:31.083 --> 01:28:32.625
[Uncle J] Emily, finally!

01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:37.166
Now, let me take your coat
and get you a drink.

01:28:40.833 --> 01:28:42.291
What are you doing?

01:28:42.291 --> 01:28:44.541
Having a drink. What are you doing?

01:28:45.666 --> 01:28:47.125
Is this a sick joke?

01:28:47.125 --> 01:28:50.875
I thought it'd be rude. Your mom went to
all this trouble, and not show up?

01:28:50.875 --> 01:28:53.458
- Can I get another beer?
- Don't you fucking dare.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.708
Are you out of your mind?

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:59.833
Is this how you're gonna end our
relationship, by setting off a bomb?

01:28:59.833 --> 01:29:02.041
Boom! People are watching.

01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:06.500
Oh, okay. Now you care what people think.
Now you're embarrassed.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:09.708
- I assumed you were gonna tell 'em.
- Oh! Okay.

01:29:09.708 --> 01:29:12.000
So, you want me to play the bad guy?

01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:14.791
Fuck that! And fuck you!

01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:19.416
Now that we're breaking up, I think
you should be the one to announce it.

01:29:19.958 --> 01:29:21.541
Tell everyone why.

01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:24.041
- Why?
- Go on. Tell them.

01:29:24.041 --> 01:29:27.500
Tell them that this isn't
our fucking engagement party,

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.708
it's our fucking farewell party.

01:29:30.958 --> 01:29:33.958
- Come on, everyone, let's raise a glass.
- [guest] Cheers.

01:29:33.958 --> 01:29:35.041
Cheers.

01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:37.375
Welcome to the Edmonds family, pumpkin.

01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:40.250
I am so happy for the two of you.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:41.958
And for your career.

01:29:41.958 --> 01:29:45.000
I heard about your promotion.
And Luke's promotion.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.958
Can someone say "power couple"?

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:51.541
- I'm sorry, what promotion?
- At your firm.

01:29:51.541 --> 01:29:54.791
He said the two of you are working as PMs.

01:29:57.333 --> 01:29:59.875
Oh, no, he's not working <i>with</i> me,

01:29:59.875 --> 01:30:01.708
he's working <i>for</i> me.

01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:04.375
Or... Or he was until I fired him.

01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:07.333
Not everybody
gets to fuck their way to the top.

01:30:07.875 --> 01:30:11.625
- Luke! What's going on?
- [Uncle J] Don't get involved.

01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:14.833
Is that what you think?

01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:19.250
I don't know.
Late night calls, late night drinks.

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:21.458
I can't say for certain it didn't happen.

01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:24.375
Hard working people
don't always get what they deserve.

01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:26.833
Maybe you had to do
a little extra convincing.

01:30:26.833 --> 01:30:28.083
- Luke, stop!
- Jesus!

01:30:28.083 --> 01:30:30.500
[Luke] She wanted to go there,
let's go there.

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.875
Admit it. Admit that's why
he gave you the promotion,

01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:36.916
because he thinks you're hot,
he wants to fuck you.

01:30:36.916 --> 01:30:39.750
Now, the question is, did you let him?

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.125
- [Uncle J] Knock it off.
- [Luke’s mother] Enough!

01:30:41.125 --> 01:30:44.500
[Luke] Why else would he ask to meet
in the middle of the night?

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:47.041
Maybe he came on to you
and you didn't know what to do.

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:50.083
Or maybe you capitalized
by getting on your knees,

01:30:50.083 --> 01:30:54.500
unzipping his pants, opening your mouth
and sucking his fucking cock!

01:30:56.041 --> 01:30:57.291
[Luke] Oh, fuck!

01:30:57.291 --> 01:30:59.458
- [Emily's mother] Sweetheart!
- [guest] Oh, my God.

01:30:59.458 --> 01:31:02.208
- [Emily's mother] Sweetheart!
- [Uncle J] Jesus.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.541
- [Luke’s mother] Luke?
- Emily!

01:31:04.541 --> 01:31:08.041
- [Uncle J] Let him go. Just leave them.
- [Luke] Where are you going?

01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:09.875
[Luke] Emily! Where are you going?

01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:15.958
You think you earned your job?
Really? You think you earned your job?

01:31:15.958 --> 01:31:19.958
It had nothing to do with you.
They needed a fucking woman to look good.

01:31:19.958 --> 01:31:24.458
I got the job because I sucked some dick
or because I checked a fucking box?

01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:25.500
Both!

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Have you completely lost it?
Do you even recognize yourself?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.625
- Look in the fucking mirror.
- No, no. You look at yourself.

01:31:34.625 --> 01:31:37.250
You act like some
big fucking swinging dick?

01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:39.291
For what, making the rich richer?

01:31:39.291 --> 01:31:43.958
- You think that makes you a fucking hero?
- I never went into this to be a hero.

01:31:43.958 --> 01:31:48.125
And neither did you, so don't judge me for
working a system you can't fucking hack!

01:31:48.125 --> 01:31:52.666
I never got the shot!
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

01:31:52.666 --> 01:31:57.875
To be treated as so irrelevant,
like a fucking cord waiting to get cut?

01:31:57.875 --> 01:32:01.833
- If you were in my position--
- I was in your position!

01:32:01.833 --> 01:32:05.333
And I fucked you on the night
that we thought it was yours!

01:32:05.333 --> 01:32:07.583
- You weren't jealous?
- I wasn't threatened!

01:32:07.583 --> 01:32:10.041
- You don't get it.
- No. No, you don't get it.

01:32:10.041 --> 01:32:13.916
Why is it so hard to accept
that I was doing better?

01:32:13.916 --> 01:32:18.333
Why is it so hard to accept
that I deserved that job?

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:20.875
Why can't that just be okay?

01:32:20.875 --> 01:32:24.416
Why does everything have to depend
on whether you make it to number one?

01:32:24.416 --> 01:32:27.208
- Get out of my face.
- No, you're a fucking coward.

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:29.666
You're a fucking coward, Luke.

01:32:29.666 --> 01:32:34.041

for trying to save you from yourself.

01:37:26.083 --> 01:37:29.000
He's been stalking me for months.

01:37:30.041 --> 01:37:34.750
And I've rejected him over and over,
not just because it's against policy,

01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:37.916
but because I've never had
any feelings for him.

01:37:38.666 --> 01:37:41.583
But he's never been able to accept that.

01:37:43.833 --> 01:37:45.791

01:39:08.291 --> 01:39:10.833
You let them worry about the story.

01:39:11.958 --> 01:39:14.458
You got more important things to focus on.

01:39:15.833 --> 01:39:18.958
No firm will touch him
after the stunt he just pulled.

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.500
He's done.

01:39:38.166 --> 01:39:39.166
Blame.

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:41.541
Accountability.

01:39:44.541 --> 01:39:45.791
It's all irrelevant.

01:39:47.583 --> 01:39:48.583
Let it go.

01:39:49.208 --> 01:39:50.208
Move on.

01:39:51.666 --> 01:39:54.125
[atmospheric music slowly building]

01:39:55.291 --> 01:39:56.375
[distant whistling]

01:40:07.833 --> 01:40:09.833
[office chatter and bustle]

01:40:13.583 --> 01:40:15.791
[Paul] It's imperative
you begin to look at everything

01:40:15.791 --> 01:40:18.208
as a potential catalyst
for investment opportunity.

01:40:18.208 --> 01:40:20.250
I can help you mold that way of thinking.

01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:23.791
But it will always be up to you to show us
your ambition and your initiative.

01:40:23.791 --> 01:40:27.458
If you adapt to that way of thinking,
the world will be your oyster.

01:40:27.458 --> 01:40:29.833
Have a seat here. This'll be your spot.

01:40:29.833 --> 01:40:31.708
Put in the password
they gave you downstairs.

01:40:31.708 --> 01:40:34.458
I'll come check on you
in a little while. Welcome.

01:40:34.458 --> 01:40:36.708
[atmospheric music continues]

01:40:43.041 --> 01:40:44.583
[office phone ringing]

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:47.833
[cell phone buzzing]

01:41:01.583 --> 01:41:02.791
[music turns forboding]

01:41:58.583 --> 01:42:00.958
So, I spoke to Jane, um...

01:42:01.625 --> 01:42:04.458
She's willing to break the lease.

01:42:05.583 --> 01:42:09.541
Theo said I could crash with him
until the end of the month.

01:42:09.541 --> 01:42:10.750
Uh, so...

01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:16.875
You can stay here
until you find another place.

01:42:18.583 --> 01:42:19.666
Um...

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:22.958
I bought the dining table,
the cabinets and the bookshelves.

01:42:22.958 --> 01:42:24.333
I know the coffee table and the...

01:42:28.333 --> 01:42:30.041
dresser are yours.

01:42:31.458 --> 01:42:33.541
I scheduled the moving company.

01:42:33.541 --> 01:42:36.583
I'll pay them to pack up
the rest of my belongings.

01:42:39.166 --> 01:42:41.958
If they have any questions,
they can call me, I, uh...

01:42:41.958 --> 01:42:44.291
I have a flight in the morning, but...

01:42:45.166 --> 01:42:46.166
What?

01:42:49.416 --> 01:42:50.250
Um...

01:42:51.166 --> 01:42:54.000
I'm going to SF to meet
with my brother's boss.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.208
He's interested in giving me
some seed money to start my own company.

01:42:59.708 --> 01:43:04.208
Why waste my time climbing the ladder
when I can just start my own firm?

01:43:04.208 --> 01:43:08.625
He thinks his partner might be interested
in investing too, which--

01:43:08.625 --> 01:43:10.583
You think I give a fuck?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.791
Why aren't you apologizing?

01:43:17.541 --> 01:43:20.000
Why aren't you begging for forgiveness?

01:43:21.916 --> 01:43:22.916
Okay.

01:43:23.875 --> 01:43:26.541
Have you seen my face?

01:43:26.541 --> 01:43:28.125
- Emily--
- No.

01:43:28.125 --> 01:43:32.666
- No, take... take a good look.
- You weren't an innocent bystander.

01:43:32.666 --> 01:43:35.583
I seem to recall you smashing
a beer bottle over my head.

01:43:35.583 --> 01:43:39.166
And you slammed my face into a sink
and raped me.

01:43:42.125 --> 01:43:43.666
Raped you?

01:43:43.666 --> 01:43:45.958
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:50.500
Then how did I get this?

01:43:52.083 --> 01:43:53.875
And that?

01:43:55.375 --> 01:43:56.833
And, uh, this?

01:43:58.125 --> 01:44:00.750
I told you to stop, and you kept going.

01:44:01.541 --> 01:44:02.708
Okay, look,

01:44:03.833 --> 01:44:06.875
we both got carried away that night.

01:44:06.875 --> 01:44:09.375
Let's leave it at that. All right?

01:44:24.916 --> 01:44:27.500
[Emily breathes heavily]

01:44:34.208 --> 01:44:35.208
No.

01:44:36.375 --> 01:44:37.375
Let's not.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.750
You-- You sit here,

01:44:50.125 --> 01:44:52.791
suddenly acting normal...

01:44:54.083 --> 01:44:56.000
after terrorizing me.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.333
- What are you doing?
- After cutting me down,

01:44:59.333 --> 01:45:01.791
day after day?

01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:07.583
And you think that I'm just gonna let you
walk out that door like nothing happened?

01:45:07.583 --> 01:45:11.875
- Okay, just stop!
- You tried to ruin my job, my reputation.

01:45:11.875 --> 01:45:14.833
What do you want me to say?

01:45:17.458 --> 01:45:20.083
I want you to get on your fucking knees

01:45:20.708 --> 01:45:22.750
and beg for mercy.

01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:25.875
Ow! Fuck!

01:45:27.125 --> 01:45:29.708
- Fuck!
- Say, "Emily, please."

01:45:30.666 --> 01:45:34.125
- Say it! Say, "Emily, please."
- Emily, please.

01:45:34.791 --> 01:45:38.291
- Say, "Emily, I'm sorry."
- Emily, I'm sorry.

01:45:38.958 --> 01:45:40.416
Now cry.

01:45:41.375 --> 01:45:42.791
- What?
- Cry!

01:45:43.833 --> 01:45:47.208
'Cause if I can't make you cry,
I'm gonna make you bleed.

01:45:49.958 --> 01:45:51.750
Ow! Fuck!

01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:53.583
- Cry!
- Fuck!

01:45:54.875 --> 01:45:56.333
Shit!

01:45:57.916 --> 01:45:59.166
What the fuck?

01:45:59.166 --> 01:46:03.333
- Say, "I'm sorry I hurt you."
- I'm sorry I hurt you.

01:46:03.333 --> 01:46:06.750
- "I'm sorry that I raped you."
- I'm sorry I raped you.

01:46:08.458 --> 01:46:10.416
Say, "I'm nothing."

01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:16.375
I'm nothing.

01:46:28.833 --> 01:46:30.500
[Luke continues sobbing]

01:46:33.958 --> 01:46:35.375
[whimpering] I'm sorry.

01:46:36.125 --> 01:46:38.541
I'm so sorry, I fucked up.

01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:42.500
I fucked up so bad.

01:46:47.125 --> 01:46:48.916
I don't know what happened.

01:46:50.416 --> 01:46:53.083
It wasn't me, I swear.

01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.125
You know it wasn't me.

01:46:57.833 --> 01:47:01.250
I'll do anything.
Tell me what I can do to make it okay.

01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:02.458
I'm so sorry.

01:47:02.458 --> 01:47:06.458
I will do anything
to make it okay for you.

01:47:28.416 --> 01:47:30.833
[softly] Now, wipe the blood off my floor

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.291
and get out.

01:47:39.333 --> 01:47:40.666
I'm done with you now.
