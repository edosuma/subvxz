WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:05.210
When two or more citizens of proven
bad character are seen together

00:05.360 --> 00:07.124
that's consorting.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.568
Six bookings, we can
lock them away for six months.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.722
Guido Calletti
is back in town.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.326
He doesn't have a wife or kids
to be running home to.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.323
When you slip in beside
Mrs Green later on,

00:18.480 --> 00:19.811
think about where I might be.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.485
You work for me now.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.290
Got yourself a bona Tide push.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.329
Hello, boys!

00:25.480 --> 00:28.245
No-one can know
that this came from me.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.290
Nobody move!
I've been framed!

00:33.240 --> 00:36.210
Hey, Syd. I own you.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.647
There's no bloody justice
in the word.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.291
How do you think the coppers
got onto our pal Herbert that night?

00:42.440 --> 00:45.205
If you're calling me a dog,

00:45.360 --> 00:47.567
you better be able to prove it.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.406
I can't wait to feel
my big man's arms around me.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:03.840 --> 01:06.366
Tilly!

02:07.360 --> 02:09.169
Tiny?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.768
Look what you done
to my fucking shoe.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.207
Fucking London, these are.
They cost a fortune!

02:23.360 --> 02:25.249
No more than you deserve,
you scraggy bitch.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.007
You'll pay for this, Jim.
You mark my words.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.204
Self-defense.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.125
Call it what you like.
We're calling it attempted murder.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.045
Alright, mate.
I was just trying to pacify her.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.168
Firing at her with a.303?
Over her head.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.482
I wasn't trying to kill her.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.369
Found hubby in bed
with the housekeeper,

02:57.520 --> 02:59.363
she started yelling,
he started shooting.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.000
Well, how'd he miss?
That woman's got three miles of front.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.810
So what do we do?

03:03.960 --> 03:05.530
Lock him up on
the attempted murder charge,

03:05.680 --> 03:07.648
her for contravening
her conditions of bail.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.041
We'll have both Devines
in the lookup by lunchtime.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.885
No, we won't.
She's not breaking the law.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.371
She has to be!

03:14.520 --> 03:16.124
She was sent to London
for two years.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.611
She's back inside four months.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.683
When she left the country,
the charges were withdrawn.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.251
Tilly, open up, you bitch!

03:29.400 --> 03:31.289
Open up! I wanna talk to you!

03:33.920 --> 03:36.082
Talk to the judge,
you murdering bastard!

03:36.240 --> 03:37.605
How come you ain't in jail anyway?

03:37.760 --> 03:40.240
Frank bailed me. I owe you, son.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.925
Put it on my tab.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.411
Tilly, please!

03:43.560 --> 03:45.927
If you don't withdraw the charges,
I'm going to jail permanent.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.687
Yeah, good. It's where you belong,
firing a rifle at your own wife!

03:49.840 --> 03:51.365
Oh, Tilly!
See you in court.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.811
Vindictive bitch!

03:53.960 --> 03:56.804
She was supposed to stay
in London for another year.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.083
She gets to come back home soot-free.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.891
Probably sitting up there
like the queen of England herself.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.850
I'm not letting that bitch strut back
into town like she owns the place.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.923
If the law won't
take care of her, I will.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.411
How? We haven't got any muscle?

04:09.560 --> 04:10.891
Well, then we'll find some.
Who?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.371
There must be
a hundred hungry buggers

04:12.520 --> 04:13.851
sitting in spitting distance
from the door

04:14.000 --> 04:15.331
who'd jump through hoops
for tuppence.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.245
Only half of those know how to use
a gun, half again shoot straight.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.641
Good luck finding one with
the balls enough to shoot at all.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.043
Maybe we don't have to worry
about Tilly any more.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.770
Big Jim kicked her out of Maroubra.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.161
If he's stuck there
and she's stuck in Palmer Street,

04:28.320 --> 04:30.721
what harm can they do anyway?

04:45.320 --> 04:46.651
You got a visitor.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.201
Huh, come
to his senses at last.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.567
It ain't Jim.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.122
Mrs Leigh.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.521
This is a surprise.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.569
Did you miss me?
Hmph.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.691
Heard you were back.
So London didn't work out for you, then?

05:04.840 --> 05:06.968
Home is where the heart is.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.009
Funny that,

05:09.160 --> 05:11.561
'cause I heard that your hubby
kicked you out of your home.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.246
Chased you with a.303, I believe.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.886
So your marriage has pretty much
fallen off the truck, then?

05:19.040 --> 05:21.247
What do you want?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.528
Well, seeing as your
in reduced circumstances

05:23.680 --> 05:26.160
and feeling for you as I do,

05:26.320 --> 05:28.527
I've come to you with an offer.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.245
A job.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.162
You can work behind my bar
to keep you going.

05:39.320 --> 05:43.211
Very funny, Mrs Leigh.
The height of comedy.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.251
What do you know
about marriage, hey?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.004
You never could find a bloke

05:48.160 --> 05:51.289
that could stand to be in the same room
as you for more than a month.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.602
You drive them off,

05:53.760 --> 05:56.081
every single one.

05:57.080 --> 06:01.324
They fuck you for a bit
and then they're gone.

06:01.480 --> 06:05.804
Jim and I are married... for life.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.124
You'll never know what that is.
You'll die alone.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.241
And you'll die sooner than you think.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.168
Conflict wasn't confined to Razorhurst.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.641
Italian dictator Benito Mussolini

06:29.800 --> 06:33.964
declared the 20th century
would be a fascist century,

06:34.120 --> 06:37.841
and in the 1930s like-minded men
all over the world rallied to his cry,

06:38.000 --> 06:43.166
hell-bent on stamping out
liberalism, democracy, socialism

06:43.320 --> 06:46.722
and all other moral corruptions.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.649
Not much of a picture.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.043
Huh, crime in Darlinghurst, hey?

06:55.200 --> 06:58.170
The police are barely making a dent.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.242
I am the police, mate.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.323
I know.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.970
Frank De Groot.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.729
You got your work cut out for you

07:12.880 --> 07:15.724
without having to worry
about the commies as well.

07:15.880 --> 07:20.647
We are not your enemy, Mr Wickham.
The New Guard are here to help.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.482
Rent's due. I've had
the landlord on my back.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.645
I'll talk to him.
He knows we're good for it.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.404
Grocery money at least.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.211
This won't even cover
what's already on the tick.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.250
I said I'll take care of it!

08:01.400 --> 08:04.085
Sweetheart, can you look to the baby?

08:12.760 --> 08:14.649
it's the whooping cough again.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.211
I should take her to the doctor,

08:17.360 --> 08:20.648
but so long as we don't have
two pennies to rub together, I...

08:22.880 --> 08:25.281
Maybe we should go home.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.929
My home, to my ma and pa, Deniliquin.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.765
To farm? They haven't got
two sticks to rub together.

08:34.919 --> 08:38.288
But they've got a garden and cheeks.
They've got food on the table.

08:38.440 --> 08:42.570
I've got money coming, alright?
The Devines owe me.

08:44.159 --> 08:48.961
Owing and paying -
they're two different things, Frank.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.482
If this is the sort of shit
that a man comes home to,

08:54.640 --> 08:56.722
I might as well not bother.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.811
Frank Green, I've got
something for you.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.247
What? Do you think I'm stupid?

09:24.680 --> 09:27.445
Well, you are if you think
I'm gonna shoot you.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.165
You wanna pay me?

09:39.320 --> 09:42.290
I wanna give you a job.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.842
Five quid there - one of those
every week you work for me.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.482
What sort of dog do you think I am,
turning on my mates?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.881
Have they been your mate,
have they, Frank?

09:52.040 --> 09:54.771
What sort of mate was Big Jim
at your murder trial?

09:54.920 --> 09:57.730
Where was he when
you were in jail, hm?

09:57.880 --> 10:00.406
That doesn't sound like a mate to me.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.210
You don't buy me.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.482
You keep it...

10:10.640 --> 10:13.371
just for thinking about it.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.442
Doll?

10:23.600 --> 10:26.046
Look what I got us for dinner.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.929
Dolly!

10:57.200 --> 10:58.611
Guido and his jailbird mates

10:58.760 --> 11:00.728
were doing quite nicely
for themselves,

11:00.880 --> 11:03.884
but he wanted a bigger slice
of the Razorhurst pie.

11:04.040 --> 11:08.762
Al Capone didn't get to the top
just rolling drunks, now, did he?

11:10.480 --> 11:12.369
Go make us some money, sweetheart.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.851
Where are you going?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.968
To talk business.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.002
No luck.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.162
You've been following
her people for a week.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.129
I can't seem to get
her coke supplier.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.044
Now, someone's bringing her the shit.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.611
We just gotta intercept
Kate's coke supplier

11:26.760 --> 11:30.606
and - whooshka! -
she's out and we're in.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.409
Did you talk to Frank Green?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.803
How did you get on
with the Little Gumnut?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.691
You better not be calling him that
if he comes to our side.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.683
Are you sure it's such a good idea?

11:41.840 --> 11:46.562
It's not about us getting him.
It's about her losing him.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.041
Two birds, one fucking stone.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.008
You heard anything from Jim?

11:53.240 --> 11:55.004
You still charging him?

11:55.160 --> 11:57.561
All he's gotta do is apologise.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.211
He better hurry up too.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.603
It makes the business look weak,
him being down there, me up here.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.171
Anyway, what about you?

12:07.320 --> 12:09.846
Who are you with now?
Frank? Guido? Someone new?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.571
Frank.

12:12.720 --> 12:17.044
Honestly, Nellie, I can't keep up.
What? You got a roster or something?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.009
How do you decide?

12:21.760 --> 12:24.764
Well, it's all fun and games
when the sun's shining,

12:24.920 --> 12:26.445
but when the 'Titanic' goes down,

12:26.600 --> 12:29.683
you'll wanna make sure you're one
of the ones on a life raft.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.651
What's the hurry? How old were you
when you and Big Jim got married?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.643
16.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.922
Oh, fuck! Come on, Blissett.
Not the fucking consorting again!

12:42.080 --> 12:43.605
Number six for you, Miss Cameron.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.411
So what? Who's counting?
Well, you should've been.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.961
Six charges in six months -
automatic jail term.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.248
Hey!
Get off! Nugget!

12:51.400 --> 12:52.731
No!
Fuck off!

12:52.880 --> 12:54.211
You know the rules, Tilly.
Nugget!

12:54.360 --> 12:58.046
Nellie made bail
but she knew she was done for

12:58.200 --> 12:59.725
Her appeal would surely fail

12:59.880 --> 13:02.724
and she'd be sent
to Long Bay for six months.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.690
Six long lonely months in jail,

13:05.840 --> 13:10.641
and the one thing Nellie couldn't stand
was being bored.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.131
Why can't I have a sherry?

13:12.280 --> 13:14.203
You can in the ladies' lounge.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.250
It's full of women.
I prefer the company of men.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.246
Nellie, your presence here
discomforts the male clientele.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.530
Sir, are you discomforted
by my presence?

13:28.200 --> 13:31.283
One sherry. One.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.926
Hey, pretty boy.
Hey!

13:53.080 --> 13:55.924
What are you doing here?
Go on. Get out of here.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.923
Now, listen up, bud.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.969
Not so brave in daylight,
are you, mate?

14:01.120 --> 14:03.282
Come on. Put up a... Come on.

14:55.040 --> 14:59.329
Nellie, is there anyone you want me
to call for you? Your mother?

15:01.120 --> 15:03.805
I just want to have some fun.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.884
You've lost a lot of blood.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.006
You're going to get me
into trouble, Little Gunmen.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.243
I believe in having a good time.

15:17.400 --> 15:21.883
I believe in never being on my own.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.363
So did you see anything?
Nah.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.010
Did you hear anything?

15:27.160 --> 15:29.891
Well, I heard the shots but...
Yeah.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.370
Looks like somebody's wandering round
with a bullet in them.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.247
Well, they won't be wandering round
for long, then, will they?

15:41.400 --> 15:44.006
This pub shooting
got anything

15:44.160 --> 15:46.049
to do with Tilly Devine
being back in town?

15:46.200 --> 15:47.565
Don't think so.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.404
With Tilly planning to give evidence
against her hubby,

15:49.560 --> 15:51.050
both sides are laying low.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.680
Nah, looked like
a straightforward bar fight to me.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.763
Times are hard. Blokes are on edge.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.491
You don't think these New Guards
are involved, do you?

15:58.640 --> 16:01.803
I've been looking
at the weekly crime reports.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.689
There's a big increase in assaults.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.889
Like I say, times are hard.

16:07.040 --> 16:11.250
Aye, but there's a dozen arrests
at a time, all on Friday nights.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.765
Every time the workers
have a meeting,

16:12.920 --> 16:14.410
the New Guard turns up to bash them.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.891
If blokes with different
points of view

16:16.040 --> 16:17.485
want to thump it out of each other,

16:17.640 --> 16:19.642
just let them get it
out of their system, mate.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.689
You think we should leave them
to assault each other?

16:21.840 --> 16:23.524
Haven't we got bigger things
to worry about?

16:24.560 --> 16:29.487
Hey? Coke peddling, sly grog,
prostitution, consorting, razors...

16:29.640 --> 16:30.971
Surely it's more important

16:31.120 --> 16:33.202
to lock up the likes
of Kate Leigh and the Devines

16:33.360 --> 16:35.601
than it is to chase a couple
of rival footy teams?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.808
You think that's
all this New Guard does?

16:37.960 --> 16:39.485
What else could it be?

16:39.640 --> 16:43.531
Bill Mackay was right
to worry. Times were desperate.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.444
The working man was fighting back

16:45.600 --> 16:47.887
and the New Guard
was ready, willing and able

16:48.040 --> 16:50.930
to meet this communist threat.

16:51.080 --> 16:54.323
Dad? Daddy?

16:55.320 --> 16:56.810
Dad?

17:04.640 --> 17:08.087
You were calling for your old man.

17:08.240 --> 17:12.244
Just a silly dream.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.200
I... They said that I was...

17:16.359 --> 17:17.964
You're fine.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.609
They got two bullets out.

17:21.839 --> 17:25.640
One's still in there. Souvenir.

17:26.640 --> 17:30.361
Best get yourself a new girl.

17:30.520 --> 17:36.004
What's the point?
I'm going to jail for six months.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.969
Excuse me.

17:38.960 --> 17:42.567
You had this with you. it's a bit of
a mess but I thought you'd want it.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.371
Thank you.

17:57.680 --> 18:01.002
Looked nice. Warm.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.483
Well, let's go.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.805
I'm serious. Let's go north.

18:09.960 --> 18:14.966
Queensland, just you and me.

18:16.360 --> 18:19.569
What about your wife?

18:22.360 --> 18:24.886
All I care about is you.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.166
You'd leave her and the kids?

18:31.160 --> 18:33.128
Yes.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.284
OK.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.048
Queensland.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.403
OW!

19:38.280 --> 19:39.770
We'll hitch.

20:10.920 --> 20:14.402
Why don't we get to carry guns?

20:14.560 --> 20:16.562
Shouldn't we be treated
the same as the men?

20:16.720 --> 20:18.609
I'm more interested in the job
than the politics.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.604
But even Nellie Cameron
gets paid more than we do.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.125
Nellie?

20:23.280 --> 20:25.009
Nellie Cameron is the most
dangerous woman in Sydney,

20:25.160 --> 20:27.083
more dangerous than Kate
and Tilly put together.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.083
Anyone here?

20:29.240 --> 20:30.844
Yeah, give us a minute.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.401
Men are like moths
to a flame with Nellie.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.881
She'll get someone killed
one of these days.

20:36.040 --> 20:40.090
Do you think she does it with women?
You know, for money?

20:40.240 --> 20:43.403
Good Lord, no.
Nellie's not like that.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.086
I bet she doesn't have to fight the men
for her own bathroom.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.447
If female police officers
are to be taken seriously,

20:48.600 --> 20:51.331
we should worry about the job,
not the amenities.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.484
Can't you lot hold it in?

21:06.200 --> 21:09.682
Jim, it's Frank.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.047
You want a lift where?
Newcastle.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.884
We'll be right from there.

21:14.040 --> 21:18.489
That's a fair way, mate,
and I've got quite a bit on.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.849
She's really bad, Jim.
I need to get her to a hospital.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.085
Look, I've gotta pop
a bit of oil in the car,

21:26.240 --> 21:28.402
then I'll call past my bookie
on the way.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.927
Then... then I'll be
on the road, alright?

21:31.080 --> 21:36.371
Thanks. Thanks, Jim. Thanks.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.011
He's on his way.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.410
You right, Tom?

21:55.560 --> 21:58.962
Superintendent, my boss
would like a quick word.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.531
Who's your boss?

22:00.680 --> 22:03.650
He's outside. He'd like
to speak in private.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.928
Well, I don't speak in private,
so whoever your boss is,

22:06.080 --> 22:08.367
he can come inside
and line up like everyone else.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.611
My boss is Jack Lang.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.920
I've got a problem.
I'm told you're the man to fix it.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.445
Sir?

22:33.600 --> 22:36.251
The New Guard. I want them stopped.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.890
Stopped from what?

22:38.040 --> 22:43.080
Organizing. Membership. Drills.
Mobilizing against the 'red menace'.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.607
Blokes with different opinions
thumping each other on weekends.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.364
My informants tell me

22:47.520 --> 22:50.364
that the New Guard has already
got over 10,000 members.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.648
That means they outmatch you lot
three to one

22:52.800 --> 22:54.165
and they're building fast.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.731
Now, I don't care
about your politics

22:55.880 --> 22:57.564
and I don't ask you to share mine,

22:57.720 --> 23:00.963
but if you don't stop them
there will be a civil war in this state.

23:01.960 --> 23:05.362
Sir, if they're such a threat,

23:05.520 --> 23:08.330
you can use the parliament,
enact laws.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.404
Parliament. Bunch of
chumped-up chemists and lawyers.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.530
Aye, still. But this conversation...

23:14.680 --> 23:19.288
I'm reorganizing the police force.
Single command. One leader.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.047
All the power he needs,
make decisions, carry them through.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.362
A senior inspector?

23:25.520 --> 23:28.251
Police commissioner,
and I tell you what, Bill,

23:28.400 --> 23:32.291
you stop the New Guard,
you'll be that commissioner.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.730
That wouldn't be a bribe?

23:36.880 --> 23:40.851
Slice it how you like, Bill.
That's what I'm offering.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.242
He'll be here soon.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.290
I just want to be warm.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.283
Once we get you to hospital,
you'll be as right as rain.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.886
Huh? We'll get those
stitches fixed up.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.931
Then we'll jump a train.
We'd be in Brisbane by breakfast.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.483
I still remember
the first time I met you,

24:13.640 --> 24:16.689
when you turned up at Tilly's
looking for a job.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.486
Yeah.

24:27.840 --> 24:31.890
At the hospital,
when you were waking up, Nell...

24:33.960 --> 24:38.045
you were calling
for your for your dad.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.050
He alive?

24:43.160 --> 24:46.369
I mean, do you have a family, Nell?

24:48.040 --> 24:52.887
What? You're wondering
who to call if I croak?

25:00.880 --> 25:04.566
This is my dad, my real dad.

25:04.720 --> 25:08.281
He was a soldier. He died over there?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.568
He came home.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.246
My mother remarried.

25:19.520 --> 25:24.367
I promised myself then,
âNever go back. â

25:26.120 --> 25:29.681
Never go back.

26:09.840 --> 26:14.880
Nell? Nell! Wake up. Wake up.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.725
Come on. Come on. Get up. Come on.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.362
On your feet. On your feet.

26:22.360 --> 26:23.805
This is killing you, Nell.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.530
Jim.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.284
He ain't coming.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.363
Fuck him.

26:30.400 --> 26:34.371
Fuck all of them. it's just you and me,
Frankie, and Queensland.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.091
You'll die.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.322
I'll die if I go back.

26:46.520 --> 26:49.205
You left your wife.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.408
Frankie...

26:57.960 --> 26:59.769
You left your wife.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.004
Frank?

27:08.560 --> 27:10.403
She left you.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.686
Nellie Cameron survived.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.763
But she didn't make it to Queensland

27:42.920 --> 27:45.082
and she'd get six months
for the consorting charge

27:45.240 --> 27:46.969
she tried to run away from.

27:47.120 --> 27:51.444
But worse than that,
she-'d lost her faith in Frank Green.

28:04.360 --> 28:07.125
Meanwhile, the game
was changing down Maroubra way.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.451
For the first time ever

28:09.600 --> 28:12.649
Tilly Devine was about to testify
against her husband, Jim,

28:12.800 --> 28:15.883
or so he thought.

28:16.040 --> 28:17.625
No, wait.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.090
Did he even say anything?

29:04.240 --> 29:05.810
About what?

29:05.960 --> 29:09.123
About me getting him off
an attempted murder charge.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.291
Ungrateful shit.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.444
I bought him this tie pin too.
It cost a pretty fucking penny.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.329
I should stab him
in the throat with it.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.244
J it must mean you love me

29:20.400 --> 29:23.165
If you love me, mister.. J'

29:23.320 --> 29:24.731
Did he ask for me?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.241
If he ain't asking, I ain't going.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.960
Maybe he just needs
some help remembering

29:36.120 --> 29:38.407
how important I am to him.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.969
What's this about?

30:48.120 --> 30:50.691
Don't know.
All hands, they said. It must be a raid.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.203
I've had word that the New Guard
intends to raid a workers' meeting

31:00.360 --> 31:01.930
in Darlinghurst tonight.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.048
I thought it was a drug raid.

31:04.200 --> 31:07.363
Now, I don't care whether you believe in
the New Guard or not.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.931
I don't care whether
you're Nationalist,

31:09.080 --> 31:10.764
Labor Party or Communist Party.

31:10.920 --> 31:13.446
In this city, we don't let
any political group

31:13.600 --> 31:16.604
decide who gets bashed
and who doesn't, right?

31:16.760 --> 31:20.287
We decide who gets bashed. I decide.

31:20.440 --> 31:24.729
So get out there and belt
their bloody heads off, alright?

31:24.880 --> 31:28.965
We thought Jack Lang would
save us, but has anything changed?

31:29.120 --> 31:31.805
Have we got more food on our table?
No!

31:31.960 --> 31:34.008
More money in our pockets?
No!

31:34.160 --> 31:36.401
Has Jack Lang given us
the jobs he promised?

32:04.040 --> 32:06.042
Spread out, men.
Take them down.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.764
Who are you, then?

32:15.680 --> 32:19.401
Francis De Groot,
New Guard commander. Free zone.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.403
Recruit number 55454.

32:21.560 --> 32:25.485
Formerly of the 15th Hussars.
I answer only to the King of England.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.804
Well, I'm Superintendent
William Mackay,

32:29.960 --> 32:32.327
and while you're in my town,
De Groot, you answer to me.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.244
You're under arrest
for inciting a riot.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.765
These men are enemies of the state.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.445
We're helping you.
That's bullshit.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.648
I don't need your help,
thank you, Mr De Groot.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.484
You can't even control
the vice in this suburb.

32:41.640 --> 32:45.884
You've got two women running
the show. Sly grog, cocaine, brothels...

32:46.040 --> 32:47.087
Hear, hear!

32:49.040 --> 32:51.441
There are enough communists
in the eastern suburbs alone

32:51.600 --> 32:53.967
to stage a Stalinist uprising.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.043
How is your tiny police force
going to stop them?

32:56.200 --> 32:59.409
The same way we're stopping you now.
Right?

32:59.560 --> 33:01.642
You've got nowhere near
the numbers we've got.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.689
You'll need us.
Really?

33:05.520 --> 33:07.010
You?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.480
You're in the New Guard?

33:10.640 --> 33:12.085
Take them away.
Charge the lot of them.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.561
And you come with me.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.090
What the hell
are you playing at?

33:18.240 --> 33:20.527
Got a right to do what I like
in my own time.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.967
Joining groups like these?
What the hell?

33:23.120 --> 33:25.885
They're on our side, Bill.
They want to help the police.

33:26.040 --> 33:29.249
They want to take
the government over.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.289
We're on the brink
of a civil war here, mate,

33:31.440 --> 33:34.284
and I will do everything in my power
to stop that happening.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.249
You want to sign up
with groups like these?

33:36.400 --> 33:38.880
Then maybe this isn't
the right job for you.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.202
All I want to do is my job, Bill.

33:41.360 --> 33:46.161
Crims, they're the ones we should
be after - Kate and Tilly.

33:46.320 --> 33:50.962
If we can't deliver on simple
law and order, then what good are we?

33:54.240 --> 33:58.245
Your mates here, they're planning
to take control of the state.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.323
Do you know that? Aye.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.642
So right now stopping them
is a bit more important

34:02.800 --> 34:05.326
than locking up
the likes of Kate Leigh.

34:07.080 --> 34:11.051
So you squash the New Guard.
What's in it for you?

34:13.040 --> 34:16.123
That's what I thought.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.125
That was great.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.850
A job well done.
We'd better wash up.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.321
I have something
that I want to show you.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.409
Ta-da!

34:37.560 --> 34:38.891
How...

34:39.040 --> 34:41.007
I asked and he said yes.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.288
Asked who?
Bill Mackay.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.362
He said no-one had asked him before.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.364
Of course, it didn't hurt
that I batted my eyelids at him.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.205
It's Superintendent Mackay.

34:52.280 --> 34:56.080
Er, I'm sorry.
I wanted to surprise you.

34:56.239 --> 34:58.846
I'm terribly sorry
if I've offended you.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.810
Of course not. Well done.

35:01.960 --> 35:06.010
Taking initiative. Excellent.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.011
I'd hate to offend you.

35:09.160 --> 35:12.369
I think the world of you,
Miss Armfield.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.728
It's beautiful.

35:31.240 --> 35:34.881
I'm sorry I was sharp.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.690
I'm so glad we're friends.

35:40.920 --> 35:44.402
I hope that we can be more.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.325
Much more.

35:53.560 --> 35:57.360
You... you think...

35:59.360 --> 36:02.523
You think that I'm...

36:02.680 --> 36:04.250
Aren't you?

36:08.960 --> 36:11.440
I think it's best we both
go our separate ways.

36:11.600 --> 36:16.322
I'll see you in the morning.
7 am sharp, as usual.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.880
I got you something in London.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.081
I wanted to go to Kate's saloon,
not this dump.

37:23.240 --> 37:28.451
Nell, you're a bail absconder.
You've got to keep a low profile.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.728
May as well be in jail.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.724
Back in a minute.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.402
So how does Kate get her cocaine?

37:49.560 --> 37:51.961
Every time a ship
comes in from China,

37:52.120 --> 37:55.044
Eileen leaves the house
with the baby

37:55.200 --> 37:57.441
at 10:00 at night on the knocker.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.284
There's a ship in tonight.

37:59.440 --> 38:03.126
You follow that pram, you'll get
to Kate Leigh's coke supplier.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.648
Mate, we only get one chance.
Next ship's not in for a month.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.202
Percy, relax. Hell or high water
wouldn't stop me, mate.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.249
Dulcie...
How much, sweetheart?

38:14.400 --> 38:17.404
Dulce, forget him. We're celebrating.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.289
Alright, mate.
Piss off.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.683
Celebrating what?

38:22.840 --> 38:25.810
Tonight I'm becoming
the new Al Capone.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.850
Who's Al Capone?

39:14.040 --> 39:16.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

39:16.680 --> 39:19.365
Nothing, it's just a scratch.
Shit.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.363
You leaving now?
What?

39:21.520 --> 39:24.126
It didn't work out.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.964
Queensland?
You want to go to Queensland?

39:26.120 --> 39:29.567
I'll take you to fucking Queensland.
Go tonight.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.449
And break down on our way
to Newcastle?

39:31.600 --> 39:34.922
Hey, we won't be breaking down.
I'll get you the fastest car in town.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.560
Yeah? I'll drive you anywhere.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.051
Queensland?

39:39.200 --> 39:40.725
Anywhere. I'll take you to New York.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.962
I will drive you to New York.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.566
You want someone that can deliver now,
that's me.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.882
I'll marry you if you want.

39:48.040 --> 39:52.090
I will marry you. I'll take you anywhere,
anywhere in the world.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.641
Frank!

40:08.120 --> 40:09.610
You're kidding me, ain't you?

40:13.040 --> 40:15.611
No! No! Frank!

40:15.760 --> 40:17.524
Are you alright?

40:17.680 --> 40:19.762
Guido, go!

40:19.920 --> 40:21.445
Go, I'll take him to the hospital.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.046
Go! I'll meet you later.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.689
Here?
Yes.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.931
Always... loved you.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.050
I'm so sorry, Frank.

40:52.720 --> 40:57.362
But what you said
when you were lying on my floor -

40:57.520 --> 40:59.648
did you mean it?

40:59.800 --> 41:01.643
You know I did.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.330
Say it again.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.691
Bloody stitches.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.171
Doctor's a butcher.

41:15.320 --> 41:17.561
Still alive, then?

41:19.400 --> 41:21.801
Settle down. I'm not here to hurt you.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.327
I'm here about my job offer.

41:24.480 --> 41:27.165
I told you, I got a job.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.563
Yeah. And where are they?

41:30.720 --> 41:33.041
Send you flowers, did they? May.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.845
What am I gonna do
with flowers?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.968
Well, you're gonna look at them
every day

41:43.120 --> 41:45.282
and they're gonna remind you
of my visit.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.841
And what else I've bought you.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.049
What else?

41:57.560 --> 42:00.928
Ł100- yours for the taking, Frankie.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.686
I'm not offering again. This is it.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.288
But what do you want me to do?

42:09.480 --> 42:11.323
Gaffney's dead.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.960
That leaves only one gunman,
and that's you, Frank.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.649
Who do you want shot?

42:17.800 --> 42:19.609
Not just shot.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.050
Shot dead.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.328
Your old boss.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.527
Tiny?

42:28.080 --> 42:29.764
Nor Tiny.

42:29.920 --> 42:32.127
Big Jim Devine.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.805
I want Tilly to suffer.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.403
I want her to know what it feels like
to lose someone she loves.

42:38.560 --> 42:42.201
I want to get her
right where she breathes.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.041
He never came.

42:54.200 --> 42:57.568
You called him, and he never came.
