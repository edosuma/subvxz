<i>Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.918 --> 00:04.552
Are you upset with me
for some reason?

00:04.587 --> 00:06.554
- You kissed Amy?
- You kissed Amy?

00:06.589 --> 00:08.656
There's been something going
on all week between you two,

00:08.691 --> 00:10.225
so what don't I know
about now?

00:10.259 --> 00:11.826
I think Ricky is in love
with you, too,

00:11.861 --> 00:12.994
so you should just
forget about Amy

00:13.028 --> 00:14.262
and who she's with
or not with.

00:14.296 --> 00:15.496
If Amy's having sex
with Ricky,

00:15.531 --> 00:16.764
I'm having sex with Ben.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.499
It was just a kiss.
We weren't having sex.

00:18.534 --> 00:20.268
It was like
kissing my sister.

00:20.302 --> 00:21.302
Is that what you're
going to tell Adrian?

00:21.337 --> 00:22.904
If you like me so much,

00:22.938 --> 00:25.073
<i>do you have to be such
good friends with Grace?</i>

00:25.107 --> 00:27.575
You don't really care about Grace.
You're still in love with Amy.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.578
I was afraid, because Amy got pregnant
before, that she'd get pregnant again.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.447
Mom said she and Dad
are getting married again.

00:32.481 --> 00:34.349
I said it because
I'm a little bit overwhelmed

00:34.383 --> 00:36.251
by all the responsibility
right now.

00:36.285 --> 00:38.920
If you heard that I kissed Ricky,
it was just a kiss, all right?

00:38.954 --> 00:40.488
I don't know why
Jimmy hasn't called me,

00:40.522 --> 00:41.823
but it's not because
I'm a bad kisser.

00:41.857 --> 00:43.358
Just don't do it,
Adrian, okay?

00:46.662 --> 00:48.997
<i>Hi, this is Adrian.
You know what to do.</i>

01:11.820 --> 01:14.289
Somebody told you?
Told me what?

01:14.323 --> 01:17.458
Don't play games. Let's just get this
over with. I'm going to be late for work.

01:17.493 --> 01:19.727
Get what over with? I don't
know what you're talking about.

01:19.762 --> 01:21.596
I tried to call you
to tell you.

01:21.630 --> 01:23.131
I didn'tet the message.

01:23.165 --> 01:24.966
You didn't get
my text message?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.602
The one where I said I love you?
You didn't get that?

01:27.636 --> 01:30.939
Oh, that.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:30.973 --> 01:31.973
So?

01:32.007 --> 01:33.308
You didn't text me back,

01:33.342 --> 01:34.542
the whole weekend.

01:34.576 --> 01:35.710
I was busy.

01:35.744 --> 01:37.011
Busy doing what?

01:38.347 --> 01:41.482
Busy having sex with Ben
in his car, on the street.

01:41.517 --> 01:44.052
'Cause you're right...
Someone did tell me.

01:45.554 --> 01:46.988
So now the score is even.

01:47.022 --> 01:48.890
You slept with Amy,
and I slept with Ben.

01:48.924 --> 01:50.892
I hope you and Amy
can live with that,

01:50.926 --> 01:53.594
the way Ben and I have had to
live with that for the past year.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.935
Yep. I slept with Ben.

02:00.970 --> 02:03.938
And I'm not going
to apologize for it.

02:03.973 --> 02:04.973
Ever.

02:06.508 --> 02:07.608
I didn't sleep with Amy.

02:07.643 --> 02:09.477
I haven't slept with Amy
since band camp,

02:09.511 --> 02:11.044
and that was before I knew you.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.447
I kissed her.
I only kissed her,

02:12.481 --> 02:14.615
and I only kissed her
because she asked me to.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.517
Ask your dad.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.925
You look sad,
little Benjamin.

02:23.959 --> 02:25.960
Mrs. Morelli,
I was feeling sad,

02:25.995 --> 02:28.629
and then you called me
little Benjamin.

02:28.664 --> 02:31.299
That makes me feel happy.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.301
I'm glad if I could
make you happy,

02:33.335 --> 02:34.969
but you don't look happy.

02:35.004 --> 02:37.472
But if you say you are happy,

02:37.506 --> 02:40.208
you want to give me a discount
on the pork chops?

02:40.242 --> 02:42.610
No, he doesn't.

02:42.644 --> 02:44.612
He can't. Only I can.

02:44.646 --> 02:47.949
I am the queen
and granter of discounts.

02:47.983 --> 02:50.184
Me, and only me.

02:50.219 --> 02:51.953
Bunny, where have you
been, dear?

02:51.987 --> 02:55.590
Having some work done?
You look thinner, younger,

02:55.624 --> 02:57.625
and you've done something
with your hair.

02:57.659 --> 02:59.660
Give them to her.

02:59.695 --> 03:01.596
You're a mood lifter,
you know that?

03:01.630 --> 03:02.897
I do what I can.

03:02.931 --> 03:04.098
Thanks. Bye.

03:04.133 --> 03:07.235
Bye.

03:07.269 --> 03:08.836
Ricky's never been late.
Where is he?

03:08.871 --> 03:10.905
He's waiting for Adrian.

03:10.939 --> 03:13.408
He wants to apologize to her
for kissing Amy.

03:13.442 --> 03:16.244
That's why you're walking around,
looking the way you're looking?

03:16.278 --> 03:19.247
Because Ricky kissed Amy?

03:19.281 --> 03:21.082
No, I'm walking around
looking the way I'm looking

03:21.116 --> 03:24.285
because I have a feeling Ricky and
I aren't going to be friends anymore.

03:24.319 --> 03:25.953
Because he kissed Amy.

03:27.489 --> 03:29.624
No, that isn't it.

03:29.658 --> 03:31.292
Something else happened.
[door opens]

03:31.326 --> 03:32.427
Hi, Bunny.

03:32.461 --> 03:33.928
Hello. Good to see you, Mr. Nealy.

03:33.962 --> 03:35.596
You left a message.
I couldn't hear you,

03:35.631 --> 03:36.798
so I came over.

03:36.832 --> 03:38.099
We got that pastrami you like.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.400
I just wanted
to let you know.

03:39.435 --> 03:41.569
Do you want a sample?
You sad about the pastrami?

03:41.603 --> 03:43.304
I look sad to you, too, huh?

03:43.338 --> 03:44.605
You look sad.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.574
You got good pastrami
and a sad face.

03:46.608 --> 03:48.109
What's that all about?

03:49.311 --> 03:51.079
[dials cell phone]

03:57.319 --> 03:58.319
I'm on my way.

03:58.353 --> 03:59.320
Are you okay?

03:59.354 --> 04:00.888
I'm fine.

04:00.923 --> 04:02.523
I'm sorry. I'll be there
in ten minutes.

04:02.558 --> 04:04.892
Do me a favor.
I don't know what's going on

04:04.927 --> 04:07.462
between you and the sad sack
that did show up,

04:07.496 --> 04:09.263
but things are slow here.

04:09.298 --> 04:11.199
Busy morning, slow afternoon.

04:11.233 --> 04:12.733
So if you need time,

04:12.768 --> 04:15.069
<i>we'll be all right here.</i>

04:15.104 --> 04:16.536
Look, kid,
I'm going to tell you

04:16.572 --> 04:20.041
what I would tell my own
genetic treasures...

04:20.075 --> 04:22.643
Don't let anything come
between you and a friend.

04:22.678 --> 04:23.811
<i>Ben is your friend.</i>

04:23.846 --> 04:26.114
Real friends are tough to find.

04:26.148 --> 04:27.949
Ben had sex with Adrian.

04:54.109 --> 04:55.543
You didn't feel anything?

04:55.577 --> 04:57.211
No, I didn't.

04:57.246 --> 05:00.882
I was very happy about it.
It was very freeing.

05:02.151 --> 05:04.785
Come on. You kissed Ricky
and felt nothing?

05:06.288 --> 05:07.788
No one kisses him
and feels nothing.

05:07.823 --> 05:09.557
Maybe you are a bad kisser.

05:09.591 --> 05:11.893
Ricky doesn't think there's
anything wrong with the way I kiss.

05:11.927 --> 05:13.895
And he is the expert.

05:13.929 --> 05:16.597
Well, you kissed him. Did you
feel anything when you kissed him?

05:16.632 --> 05:17.965
Thanks for rubbing in
that wound.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.269
So you still care
that I kissed him?

05:21.303 --> 05:22.803
I had a baby with him.

05:22.838 --> 05:24.105
I care if you kissed him.

05:24.139 --> 05:26.140
But how can you care
if he kisses someone else,

05:26.175 --> 05:29.143
when you didn't feel anything
when you kissed him yourself?

05:29.178 --> 05:30.778
I mean, you don't
still want him, right?

05:30.812 --> 05:31.879
Right.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.615
I don't have feelings
for Ricky.

05:34.650 --> 05:38.586
Maybe I did. Maybe I liked him at
band camp, but I don't love him.

05:38.620 --> 05:40.454
Which doesn't mean
I wouldn't care

05:40.489 --> 05:43.257
if he was with either
of my best friends. Okay?

05:43.292 --> 05:45.693
And if I ever did feel
anything for Ricky, I'm over it.

05:47.496 --> 05:49.497
This guy right here
is the only guy I love.

05:49.531 --> 05:50.798
Right, John?

05:53.902 --> 05:55.203
I'm telling you the truth.

05:55.237 --> 05:56.204
All right.

05:56.238 --> 05:58.139
But are you gonna call Jimmy?

05:58.173 --> 05:59.574
Find out why
he hasn't called you,

05:59.608 --> 06:01.475
after you read to John.
I might.

06:01.510 --> 06:03.744
But not Ben?
No, not Ben.

06:03.779 --> 06:07.481
I am over him, too.
Look, Ben's a nice guy,

06:07.516 --> 06:09.951
but maybe too nice, you
know? He's not that nice.

06:09.985 --> 06:10.985
Yeah, he is.

06:11.019 --> 06:12.620
No, he's not.

06:12.654 --> 06:13.788
Ben?

06:13.822 --> 06:14.789
Ben.

06:14.823 --> 06:16.724
I heard he slept with Adrian.

06:22.097 --> 06:23.297
Adrian?

06:23.332 --> 06:26.767
Ricky must have told her
that I kissed him,

06:26.802 --> 06:28.636
and she went after Ben.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.271
But Ben didn't have to say yes.

06:30.305 --> 06:32.139
But he did.

06:32.174 --> 06:35.776
What happened, happened.

06:35.811 --> 06:37.878
I'm going to have
to get John to bed.

06:37.913 --> 06:39.981
You two have to go home.
All right.

06:40.015 --> 06:41.449
Or we could stay with John,

06:41.483 --> 06:43.251
if you want to go over
and talk to Ben.

06:43.285 --> 06:44.585
Or Adrian.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.954
I wouldn't get
to read with him.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.122
I love reading to John.

06:48.156 --> 06:49.523
It's my favorite part
of the day.

06:49.558 --> 06:50.658
We could read to him.

06:50.692 --> 06:52.460
Yeah. Let us read to John.

06:52.494 --> 06:54.629
We can put him to bed.
We can do it.

06:54.663 --> 06:56.464
I'm supposed to watch
Robbie, too.

06:56.498 --> 06:57.632
Well, right now,
Ashley's watching Robbie.

06:57.666 --> 06:59.834
Well, where are your parents?

06:59.868 --> 07:01.335
They're...

07:01.370 --> 07:03.304
Not home.

07:03.338 --> 07:04.472
Yeah, I know that.

07:05.807 --> 07:07.208
How old are you, again?

07:07.242 --> 07:08.709
15.

07:08.744 --> 07:12.380
I just turned 15
over the holidays.

07:12.414 --> 07:16.384
And how old was Amy
when she got pregnant?

07:16.418 --> 07:18.019
15.

07:18.053 --> 07:21.889
Your parents probably don't want
you around any guys, I would think.

07:21.923 --> 07:23.391
Did you ask
if I can come over?

07:23.425 --> 07:24.425
No.

07:24.459 --> 07:25.493
Wow.

07:25.527 --> 07:27.361
You say that a lot.

07:27.396 --> 07:30.064
I know. I'm wowed a lot.

07:30.098 --> 07:31.532
This time, by your
rebellious nature.

07:31.566 --> 07:32.733
Your parents
don't know I'm here?

07:32.768 --> 07:34.335
Nope. They're not home.

07:34.369 --> 07:35.736
It's like something
I would do...

07:35.771 --> 07:38.105
Have you over to my house
and hide you in my room,

07:38.140 --> 07:40.074
like a Christmas present
stolen from under the tree.

07:40.108 --> 07:42.143
A good present.

07:42.177 --> 07:43.411
You know, something
you really wanted,

07:43.445 --> 07:44.478
and you finally got.

07:46.448 --> 07:47.548
I love sneaking around.

07:47.582 --> 07:49.750
I don't know if it's
sneaking around.

07:49.785 --> 07:51.752
I just didn't ask them.

07:51.787 --> 07:53.421
I didn't want to set
any precedent

07:53.455 --> 07:55.923
for asking permission
to see you or anything.

07:55.957 --> 07:59.093
Oh, yeah. Well, that's good.

07:59.127 --> 08:01.996
Until it actually comes up whether
or not you can go out with me...

08:02.030 --> 08:04.699
Then, I don't know, the parents
may want to have some say in it.

08:04.733 --> 08:05.966
They may or they may not.

08:06.001 --> 08:09.337
They may notven notice
you're around.

08:09.371 --> 08:12.373
You could fall under
my cloak of invisibility.

08:12.407 --> 08:14.342
I'm invisible
much of the time here.

08:14.376 --> 08:16.644
Well, with no baby and all...

08:16.678 --> 08:19.680
So if they don't know
I'm here, I could...

08:19.715 --> 08:24.685
We could have
kind of a sleepover.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.721
Yeah, I guess.

08:26.755 --> 08:28.522
That would be funny, huh,
if I slept over.

08:28.557 --> 08:30.157
Yeah.

08:30.192 --> 08:31.559
Then again, what if
we're not so invisible,

08:31.593 --> 08:33.427
and we get caught and
they never let me see you?

08:33.462 --> 08:36.097
Then we get caught. You're
saying I can sleep over?

08:36.131 --> 08:37.698
You're willing
to take the risk?

08:37.732 --> 08:39.700
There can't be
any physical contact.

08:39.735 --> 08:42.203
You'd have to sleep on the floor
or on the couch, like Griffin does.

08:42.236 --> 08:45.072
Griffin sleeps over?
Yes.

08:45.107 --> 08:48.175
What about physical contact
if we're vertical?

08:48.210 --> 08:50.711
Don't ask me
if you can kiss me, okay?

08:50.746 --> 08:52.880
I don't want a guy to ask me
if he can kiss me,

08:52.914 --> 08:54.849
because if a guy asks me
and I think about it,

08:54.883 --> 08:56.450
then the answer
is going to be...

09:05.427 --> 09:06.527
[camera shutter snaps]

09:08.697 --> 09:11.165
When the baby wakes up, I want
you to take a picture of us

09:11.199 --> 09:13.000
so I can send it to Jack.

09:13.034 --> 09:15.936
Yeah, and then I'll hold him. I
want to send a picture to Jesse.

09:17.372 --> 09:19.707
Why do we want our boyfriends
to see us holding a baby?

09:19.741 --> 09:23.310
I don't know. Maybe because we want to
get married and have babies with them.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.079
That's a scary thing
to say out loud.

09:25.113 --> 09:26.447
Don't tell me
you weren't thinking it.

09:26.481 --> 09:28.015
Oh, no, I was thinking it.

09:28.049 --> 09:30.184
I just wouldn't want Jack
to know I was thinking it.

09:30.218 --> 09:31.352
I don't think he'd like it.

09:31.386 --> 09:33.754
No guy in high school
wants to have a baby.

09:33.789 --> 09:35.356
Yeah, you're right.

09:35.390 --> 09:38.025
It is way too young to
start thinking about babies

09:38.059 --> 09:40.294
and stuff like that.

09:40.328 --> 09:42.029
Yeah. Stuff like that.

09:42.063 --> 09:43.697
Like marriage and babies.

09:43.732 --> 09:45.399
Yeah. Way too soon.

09:46.401 --> 09:48.702
- But I think about it.
- I do, too.

09:48.737 --> 09:50.204
But just because
I'm thinking about it,

09:50.238 --> 09:53.073
it doesn't mean I want to do
it any time in the near future.

09:53.108 --> 09:56.377
Me, either. I also want to move
to France and live by myself,

09:56.411 --> 09:58.979
but I'm not ready
to do that, either.

09:59.014 --> 10:01.916
Besides, if Jack or Jesse knew we were
thinking about marriage or babies...

10:01.950 --> 10:03.384
They'd break up with us.

10:03.418 --> 10:04.418
[cell phone rings]

10:06.087 --> 10:08.956
It's him. Hello.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.391
Hey, Lauren.

10:10.425 --> 10:12.226
Hey, Jesse.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.894
Are you still at Amy's?

10:13.929 --> 10:17.097
<i>Yeah. She stuck me and Madison
with the baby so she could go out.</i>

10:17.132 --> 10:21.068
You know, personally,
I never want to have a baby,

10:21.102 --> 10:22.903
or get married or anything.

10:24.105 --> 10:26.740
No. Me, neither.

10:26.775 --> 10:28.843
Not for a long, long time.

10:28.877 --> 10:31.412
Long time.

10:31.446 --> 10:34.448
I'm going to call Jack
and tell him the same thing.

10:34.483 --> 10:37.418
Wow.

10:37.452 --> 10:40.087
Wow, back.

10:40.121 --> 10:42.756
This is a good feeling.

10:42.791 --> 10:43.824
Really good feeling.

10:43.859 --> 10:45.693
Think it'll last?

10:45.727 --> 10:46.794
Forever.

10:46.828 --> 10:47.862
Not possible.

10:47.896 --> 10:49.163
Totally possible.

10:49.197 --> 10:51.165
Slight chance
that it's possible.

10:51.199 --> 10:52.199
I'll take that.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.106
I'm tired of making
the same mistakes,

10:59.140 --> 11:02.276
and I'm tired of living
with your mistakes and Amy's.

11:02.310 --> 11:04.645
I just don't want to make
another mistake.

11:04.679 --> 11:07.181
I'm a mistake?
The children are a mistake?

11:07.215 --> 11:08.382
What's a mistake?

11:08.416 --> 11:10.551
A mistake is making
the wrong decision.

11:10.585 --> 11:12.853
It's... You know
what a mistake is.

11:12.888 --> 11:15.723
Yeah, I do. Like when you told everyone at the mother
- daughter dance

11:15.757 --> 11:18.392
we're getting remarried, just because
you felt pressured by a bunch of girls.

11:18.426 --> 11:19.660
She told everyone
we're getting remarried.

11:19.694 --> 11:22.029
So you want to get remarried?

11:22.063 --> 11:23.731
How many times
do I have to say it?

11:23.765 --> 11:25.232
I want to get remarried.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.234
I want to be married
to the mother of my children.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.736
But you know what? I've had it.

11:28.770 --> 11:30.504
I want a commitment,
right here and now.

11:30.539 --> 11:33.374
I came to therapy with you. Are
you going to remarry me or not?

11:36.878 --> 11:38.579
Thanks a lot.

11:38.613 --> 11:39.580
You were a big help.

11:39.614 --> 11:42.416
Mr. Famous Family Therapist.
You stink.

11:45.587 --> 11:47.588
He amuses you?
Yeah, he does.

11:47.622 --> 11:49.557
And what about George
amuses you?

11:49.591 --> 11:52.192
He's just so honest.

11:52.227 --> 11:54.194
Honest?

11:54.229 --> 11:56.096
He cheated on me.

11:56.131 --> 11:57.765
He had an affair
with another woman.

11:57.799 --> 11:58.832
That's not honest.

11:58.867 --> 12:01.368
Yeah, but his feelings
about it are honest.

12:01.403 --> 12:04.038
George is very honest
about his feelings.

12:04.072 --> 12:06.640
Well, he just told you
that you stink.

12:06.675 --> 12:09.710
I know. Most of the time, it
takes patients months, even years,

12:09.744 --> 12:12.513
to question my authority,
but George...

12:12.547 --> 12:16.383
George what? Look, we do not
have the money to come here,

12:16.418 --> 12:18.052
so why don't you just
cut to the chase

12:18.086 --> 12:20.888
and tell me what you
want to say, oh wise ass?

12:20.922 --> 12:22.122
How's that for honesty?

12:22.157 --> 12:24.391
Not exactly what
I was talking about.

12:24.426 --> 12:26.827
That's not honesty.
That's anger.

12:26.861 --> 12:28.062
But all right.

12:28.096 --> 12:31.398
All right. I don't usually
say what I think,

12:31.433 --> 12:35.302
because that's not really the
purpose of people coming here,

12:35.337 --> 12:38.105
to hear what I think,
but that's what you want.

12:38.139 --> 12:42.576
Fine. But let me do it

12:42.611 --> 12:46.413
as a friend of the family.

12:46.448 --> 12:48.282
There's no charge for this.

12:48.316 --> 12:49.783
Great.

12:49.818 --> 12:55.289
The issue of control keeps coming
up over and over again for you.

12:56.424 --> 12:58.225
You can't control life.

12:58.259 --> 13:01.128
You can only live your life.

13:01.162 --> 13:03.230
And you can live it
in any way you want,

13:03.264 --> 13:07.001
in that you can choose your
feelings about the people around you,

13:07.035 --> 13:09.269
and what's going on
around you,

13:09.304 --> 13:11.271
so live it like that.

13:11.306 --> 13:15.009
Give up trying to control it,
and live it.

13:15.043 --> 13:16.677
Live it to the fullest.

13:16.711 --> 13:19.346
Life is good,
whether you're happy or not.

13:19.381 --> 13:25.352
Personally, I think the pursuit of
happiness is just a waste of time,

13:25.387 --> 13:29.023
so forget about being happy.

13:29.057 --> 13:32.826
What is happiness anyway, other than
being surrounded by people who love you?

13:32.861 --> 13:36.096
And you can't choose
how they love you.

13:36.131 --> 13:40.367
You can only choose
to feel the love.

13:40.402 --> 13:46.040
Feel the love. This is a
wonderful time in your life,

13:46.074 --> 13:47.775
if you choose
to see it that way.

13:47.809 --> 13:50.210
And as far as
all the mistakes go,

13:50.245 --> 13:53.047
is anything really a mistake?

13:53.081 --> 13:56.717
Or are mistakes just lessons?

13:56.751 --> 13:59.286
Everyone makes mistakes.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.622
Life is a school,

14:01.656 --> 14:02.823
a learning process,

14:02.857 --> 14:05.993
and some lessons are
more painful than others,

14:06.027 --> 14:07.661
but that's just how it is.

14:07.696 --> 14:10.397
That's just how it is, Anne.

14:10.432 --> 14:13.000
The sum total
of our experiences

14:13.034 --> 14:15.669
is what makes us
who we are.

14:15.704 --> 14:20.674
All good experiences would not result
in becoming the strong, interesting,

14:20.709 --> 14:23.310
beautiful woman that you are.

14:23.344 --> 14:27.347
So give yourself a break, huh?

14:27.382 --> 14:30.017
As well as George and Amy.

14:30.051 --> 14:32.986
Mistakes happen.

14:35.857 --> 14:37.658
It was a mistake.

14:37.692 --> 14:41.195
A stupid, stupid mistake.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.238
It's okay, Adrian.

14:50.272 --> 14:53.574
It's okay. Everything's
going to be fine.

14:53.609 --> 14:55.209
I thought they slept together.

14:55.244 --> 14:58.246
I know, but truthfully,

14:58.280 --> 15:01.249
I think you would have been just as angry
if you thought they just kissed each other.

15:01.283 --> 15:03.618
Why did I do that? Why?

15:03.652 --> 15:05.253
To get back at them.

15:05.287 --> 15:09.156
I know, but in
getting back at them,

15:09.191 --> 15:10.725
I screwed up everything
for myself.

15:10.759 --> 15:12.827
And me.

15:12.861 --> 15:13.928
And Ben.

15:13.962 --> 15:15.730
And Amy, and Ricky,

15:15.764 --> 15:17.632
and really, even Jack.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.201
I came over here
for help and comfort.

15:20.235 --> 15:21.402
I'm sorry.

15:21.436 --> 15:23.037
I am really, really
sorry, Adrian,

15:23.071 --> 15:24.839
but you did the wrong thing.

15:24.873 --> 15:26.374
Again.

15:26.408 --> 15:28.309
Excuse me?

15:28.343 --> 15:31.112
The trouble really started
when you had sex with Jack.

15:31.146 --> 15:32.513
If you hadn't
had sex with Jack,

15:32.548 --> 15:36.183
I don't think I would have
had sex with Jack.

15:36.218 --> 15:37.585
And then your father
wouldn't have died.

15:37.619 --> 15:38.986
Are we back to that?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.688
No. That was just
a terrible thought I had

15:40.722 --> 15:42.857
when I was consumed with guilt
because I had sex with Jack.

15:42.891 --> 15:44.125
You know,
I don't understand that.

15:44.159 --> 15:47.194
The guilt you had about
having sex with Jack.

15:47.229 --> 15:49.530
You love Jack.
Jack loves you.

15:49.565 --> 15:53.034
You both wanted to have sex. You
weren't cheating on each other.

15:53.068 --> 15:55.002
So where does the guilt
fit in? I don't understand.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.537
I think you do understand.

15:56.572 --> 15:58.539
I think everything
you've been saying tonight

15:58.574 --> 16:00.808
indicates that you
fully understand.

16:00.842 --> 16:02.310
You're consumed with guilt,

16:02.344 --> 16:06.647
guilt that you have
because you had sex.

16:06.682 --> 16:12.486
Okay. It wasn't wrong to have
sex with Ben, in and of itself.

16:12.521 --> 16:15.156
It was just wrong
that I did it

16:15.190 --> 16:16.824
to get back at Amy and Ricky,

16:16.858 --> 16:18.926
and because it isn't
going to get me what I wanted.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.828
It isn't going to get me
anything at all.

16:20.862 --> 16:24.498
No, it isn't, but that's
not why it's a mistake.

16:24.533 --> 16:27.168
It's a mistake because sex
outside of marriage is a mistake,

16:27.202 --> 16:30.171
in and of itself,
and I think you know that,

16:30.205 --> 16:32.173
whether you want
to admit it or not.

16:32.207 --> 16:35.509
You know, I don't know why I
ever became friends with you.

16:35.544 --> 16:38.512
Oh, no, wait. I do.

16:38.547 --> 16:41.849
I became friends with you because
it used to make me feel good

16:41.883 --> 16:45.853
that the smart and beautiful
and popular Grace Bowman

16:45.887 --> 16:47.989
would be friends with me.
But you know what?

16:48.023 --> 16:51.859
You're really
no better than I am,

16:51.893 --> 16:55.129
and being friends with you
doesn't make me feel good anymore.

16:55.163 --> 16:59.066
I'm not responsible for your bad
feelings about yourself. You are.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.135
Maybe if you didn't have
sex with every guy you know,

17:01.169 --> 17:02.470
you'd like yourself
a little better.

17:06.608 --> 17:11.145
Adrian, she doesn't know
what she's saying.

17:11.179 --> 17:12.813
She's a crazy woman.

17:12.848 --> 17:17.218
Even if you hate yourself,
I love you.

17:17.252 --> 17:19.920
As a friend, of course.

17:19.954 --> 17:22.323
Thanks, Tom, but I don't want
any friends right now.

17:23.692 --> 17:25.760
Have you lost your mind?

17:25.794 --> 17:29.063
Were you eavesdropping again?
Yes.

17:29.097 --> 17:30.831
I don't want to discuss it.

17:30.866 --> 17:35.503
I'm here to point out that you
are supposed to be Christian.

17:35.537 --> 17:39.507
You put her down
and made her feel terrible.

17:39.541 --> 17:44.945
Either you messed up big time,
or you're the devil.

17:46.882 --> 17:48.516
Are you sure?

17:48.550 --> 17:49.850
Well, I wasn't there,

17:49.885 --> 17:52.186
but they both told me.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.522
I'm telling you,
I'm going to...

17:54.556 --> 17:56.524
Talk to him?

17:56.558 --> 17:59.794
Why would he
do something like that?

17:59.828 --> 18:02.063
Opportunity
presented herself.

18:02.097 --> 18:05.032
Oh, hello. I didn't know
we had company.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.268
Oh, hi, Betty.
I was just leaving.

18:07.302 --> 18:10.304
Please don't leave,
because Leo and I

18:10.338 --> 18:11.639
have something
we want to ask you.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.474
Maybe we should ask her
some other time.

18:13.508 --> 18:15.476
Is the wedding still on?

18:15.510 --> 18:17.144
Of course it is.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.815
It's just a bad thing, you
know? A little problem at work.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.817
Good to see you, Betty.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.152
Hang on a second, Bunny.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.455
I don't want to mess things up
for my bride here.

18:27.489 --> 18:29.323
Go ahead, Betty. Ask her.

18:29.357 --> 18:31.659
I never slept with him. We
were never romantically linked.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.561
Well, of course not.

18:33.595 --> 18:36.163
No, Leo's first wife
was his high school sweetheart,

18:36.198 --> 18:38.766
so he wouldn't have had time
to link up with you.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.002
It's just that Bunny,
I wanted to ask you in person,

18:42.037 --> 18:44.171
and I was going to come by
the butcher shop,

18:44.206 --> 18:47.308
but it's just so...
so meaty down there.

18:47.342 --> 18:50.678
I was just wondering if you
would care to be my maid of honor.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.313
I'd be honored, Betty.

18:52.347 --> 18:54.348
Thank you for asking.

18:55.383 --> 18:58.085
But is Ben going to be
your best man?

18:58.120 --> 19:00.955
'Cause tonight's conversation

19:00.989 --> 19:05.626
might make for some awkward
social circumstances for a while,

19:05.660 --> 19:06.794
if you know what I mean.

19:06.828 --> 19:09.797
No. No, I don't know
what you mean.

19:09.831 --> 19:11.332
Is that a yes or a no?

19:11.366 --> 19:14.969
That's a "we'll see how
things go when I talk to Ben."

19:16.538 --> 19:18.139
Have you ever been beaten up?

19:18.173 --> 19:19.673
Really pummeled to the ground?

19:19.708 --> 19:21.809
Yes, I have,

19:21.843 --> 19:23.310
by the guy
who called Amy a slut.

19:23.345 --> 19:24.345
Ironic.

19:24.379 --> 19:25.613
Now you're the slut.

19:25.647 --> 19:26.981
I'm in a state of shock.

19:27.015 --> 19:28.315
I don't know what to say.

19:28.350 --> 19:29.784
How could you make
that kind of mistake?

19:29.818 --> 19:31.952
I don't know.
I really don't know.

19:31.987 --> 19:33.254
Okay, I do know,

19:33.288 --> 19:35.322
but if I try to say
how or why it happened,

19:35.357 --> 19:37.158
it just comes off
as an excuse,

19:37.192 --> 19:38.826
and there's not an excuse.

19:38.860 --> 19:41.495
Ricky has a violent past. This
could trigger something really bad.

19:41.530 --> 19:44.365
I think the sooner you talk to him,
the better. I don't think he'd hit me.

19:44.399 --> 19:46.934
Even if he hadn't had a violent
past, I think he'd hit you.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.903
I hope he does.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.504
I hope he does hit me.

19:50.539 --> 19:51.639
I'd feel better if he did.

19:51.673 --> 19:53.174
I think we better
be going.

19:53.208 --> 19:56.177
Now?
Yes, Hank. I have to get home.

19:56.211 --> 19:58.512
And so do you.

19:58.547 --> 20:00.681
All right. Bye.

20:03.885 --> 20:05.986
We have to get him
some help, now.

20:08.890 --> 20:10.524
I'll take Robbie now.
Thanks for watching him.

20:10.559 --> 20:13.194
No problem.

20:13.228 --> 20:14.528
Oh, yeah.

20:14.563 --> 20:15.696
Dad?

20:15.730 --> 20:16.864
Did you want to meet Grant?

20:16.898 --> 20:18.365
He's Griffin's cousin.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.134
Oh. Hey. Nice to meet you.

20:21.436 --> 20:22.503
I'm going
to assume you're gay,

20:22.537 --> 20:24.004
because that would be
easiest right now.

20:24.039 --> 20:25.272
Thank you, sir.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.874
Nice meeting you.

20:26.908 --> 20:28.442
Good night.

20:29.911 --> 20:30.878
What did I tell you?

20:30.912 --> 20:32.046
Wow.

20:47.262 --> 20:49.063
Hi, girls.

20:49.097 --> 20:53.734
Oh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Juergens...
Ms. Juergens.

20:53.768 --> 20:54.902
Is it Juergens?

20:56.238 --> 20:57.204
Where's Amy?

20:57.239 --> 20:58.205
Is she in the house?

20:58.240 --> 21:00.274
She's in the house, right?

21:00.308 --> 21:01.842
No, she's not in the house.

21:01.877 --> 21:03.777
That's why we're in the house.
We're babysitting.

21:03.812 --> 21:05.479
Why isn't Ricky
babysitting?

21:05.513 --> 21:07.147
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.515
And you don't know
where Amy is?

21:08.550 --> 21:09.650
Or where Ricky is?

21:11.019 --> 21:12.019
It's okay. I'll call her.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.153
I'll find out where she is.

21:13.188 --> 21:16.523
[cell phone rings]

21:16.558 --> 21:17.858
That's your phone.

21:17.893 --> 21:18.959
Yes, I know.

21:18.994 --> 21:21.528
[ringing continues]

21:21.563 --> 21:23.097
Is that why
you didn't call me?

21:29.648 --> 21:32.617
You couldn't just tell me
that you found the condom?

21:32.651 --> 21:34.786
Why would I? I didn't
want to see you again.

21:34.820 --> 21:36.621
Because I had a condom?

21:36.655 --> 21:38.022
Because you lied.

21:38.056 --> 21:39.624
I thought you lied.

21:39.658 --> 21:40.958
I wasn't lying.

21:40.993 --> 21:43.628
I have no intention
of having sex again,

21:43.662 --> 21:44.729
at least not in high school.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.531
And yet.

21:46.565 --> 21:48.466
And yet I had a condom,
because everyone has condoms.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.500
Not everyone.

21:49.535 --> 21:51.969
I don't. You know why?

21:52.004 --> 21:55.139
Because I wasn't lying when I said
I wasn't having sex in high school.

21:55.174 --> 21:56.407
I wasn't, either.

21:59.311 --> 22:00.845
I see.

22:00.879 --> 22:04.515
Is this because I did
have sex in high school.

22:04.550 --> 22:08.986
No, it's not.
How did that happen?

22:09.021 --> 22:10.621
How did I get pregnant?

22:12.090 --> 22:14.759
The usual way.

22:14.793 --> 22:18.963
We were making out and...

22:18.997 --> 22:20.998
I don't know. We were
just more than making out.

22:21.033 --> 22:23.267
I didn't mean to.
It was a mistake.

22:23.302 --> 22:28.539
So the condom was just in
case you made another mistake.

22:28.574 --> 22:30.942
No.

22:30.976 --> 22:34.111
Does anyone really know when
they're about to make a mistake?

22:34.146 --> 22:36.314
If they knew they were
going to make the mistake,

22:36.348 --> 22:38.683
then they wouldn't make
the mistake.

22:38.717 --> 22:40.218
Yeah, they would.

22:40.252 --> 22:42.119
People know they're making
mistakes all the time.

22:42.154 --> 22:44.121
They just go ahead
and make the mistake.

22:44.156 --> 22:46.924
They can't seem to help it.

22:46.959 --> 22:49.794
[sighs]
Look, I'm sorry, Amy.

22:49.828 --> 22:54.432
I'm really determined
not to complicate my life

22:54.466 --> 22:55.933
with sex right now.

22:55.968 --> 22:58.169
It was a decision I made
ahead of time.

22:58.203 --> 23:01.072
Why... Why did you drive
up here tonight?

23:01.106 --> 23:02.406
Why? Why tonight?

23:02.441 --> 23:05.910
Because I found out that Ben
had sex with Adrian.

23:05.944 --> 23:09.947
Okay, I felt betrayed
by him and by her.

23:09.982 --> 23:13.184
You know it's been driving me
crazy that you haven't called me?

23:13.218 --> 23:15.386
Because I really do like you.

23:31.069 --> 23:34.805
There was, um,
the short amount of time

23:34.840 --> 23:38.376
that I thought you didn't call
me because I was a bad kisser

23:38.410 --> 23:39.610
or something.

23:39.645 --> 23:44.448
Can I just...
I mean, I forgot.

23:49.821 --> 23:51.455
Route.

23:52.524 --> 23:54.825
Oh, hey, Betty.
Do you know where my dad is?

23:54.860 --> 23:56.093
I just need to talk to him.

23:56.128 --> 23:58.563
Oh, yeah, he's not home. Oh.

23:58.597 --> 23:59.797
You want to talk to me?

23:59.831 --> 24:02.600
Actually, no, Betty,
not about this.

24:02.634 --> 24:04.869
Can you think
of a three-letter word

24:04.903 --> 24:08.239
for a guy that sleeps with
his best friend's girlfriend?

24:08.273 --> 24:13.945
Because I have B-E-N... Ben.

24:13.979 --> 24:15.813
Eh... Do you know
where my dad is?

24:15.847 --> 24:18.115
I know he's not home,
but where is he?

24:18.150 --> 24:20.451
I'm going to have to have
him tell you.

24:20.485 --> 24:22.386
Why would you sleep
with Adrian?

24:22.421 --> 24:24.455
How did you find that out?
What, does it matter?

24:24.489 --> 24:25.990
It might. Who told you?

24:26.024 --> 24:28.559
I can't say. Do you want
to talk to me about it?

24:28.594 --> 24:31.963
Do I want to talk about a mistake
I made with sex to a hooker?

24:35.233 --> 24:37.034
Good night.

24:37.069 --> 24:38.569
Wait, Betty...

24:44.343 --> 24:47.878
Heard you need some help.
Some guy let me in.

24:47.913 --> 24:50.481
Henry and Alice called. They said you
might be getting beat up or something.

24:50.515 --> 24:52.650
Hit me. No, they didn't
call me to beat you up.

24:52.684 --> 24:54.785
They said someone else
was going to beat you up.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.020
I know, I know,
but just please...

24:56.054 --> 24:57.688
just hit me
as hard as you can.

24:57.723 --> 25:00.825
I don't do that. I don't
hit people, get into fights.

25:00.859 --> 25:03.227
I don't have any desire
to hit anyone.

25:03.261 --> 25:04.996
I had sex with Adrian.
Me, too.

25:05.030 --> 25:08.766
I had sex with Adrian, and now
Ricky is going to pummel me,

25:08.800 --> 25:10.768
and I hope he pummels me

25:10.802 --> 25:12.036
because I deserve
to get pummeled.

25:12.070 --> 25:13.471
It's a little extreme,
don't you think?

25:13.505 --> 25:15.506
[sighs]
No.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.511
[whistles]
Nice place.

25:20.545 --> 25:22.980
Thanks.

25:23.015 --> 25:24.081
Hey, he'll get over it.

25:24.116 --> 25:25.583
She'll get over it.

25:25.617 --> 25:27.818
Just don't go do
anything stupid, all right?

25:27.853 --> 25:28.886
I already did
something stupid.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.054
I just told you.

25:30.088 --> 25:31.822
I betrayed a friend,

25:31.857 --> 25:33.991
and I used another friend
for sex,

25:34.026 --> 25:37.261
and I've crossed a line that is
personally demoralizing, and that...

25:37.295 --> 25:38.996
And that?

25:39.031 --> 25:42.066
And that means Amy is never, ever
going to consider going back with me.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.135
I've lost her... forever

25:44.169 --> 25:46.404
just because
of one stupid mistake.

25:46.438 --> 25:48.773
Yeah, funny how that happens,

25:48.807 --> 25:51.509
how one stupid mistake
can change your life,

25:51.543 --> 25:53.644
or create life,
like Ricky and Amy.

25:53.679 --> 25:55.680
Right... Right.

25:55.714 --> 25:58.683
They made the same mistake,
kind of.

25:58.717 --> 26:02.086
Do you think there's a chance
that she'll ever understand... Amy?

26:02.120 --> 26:04.588
No, I doubt it.

26:04.623 --> 26:06.657
Girls don't understand
those kind of mistakes.

26:06.692 --> 26:09.527
They don't want to understand
those kind of mistakes.

26:09.561 --> 26:12.830
Grace said she forgave me for
the mistake I made with Adrian,

26:12.864 --> 26:14.832
and all the other mistakes
I made,

26:14.866 --> 26:17.702
but I don't think she did.

26:17.736 --> 26:19.236
Hey, look at it this way.

26:19.271 --> 26:20.771
Up until now, you didn't
have any understanding

26:20.806 --> 26:24.642
on how that kind of mistake
could happen, did you?

26:24.676 --> 26:28.345
Thanks, and thanks for coming
over, Jack. It's really nice of you.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.281
Not like I had
anything else to do.

26:32.484 --> 26:33.818
You have enough problems
of your own.

26:33.852 --> 26:35.219
You don't need to hear
about my problems.

26:35.253 --> 26:37.855
No, no, I'm more than willing
to hear about your problems.

26:37.889 --> 26:41.025
I mean, you just came over to help
the guy who's seeing the girl you love.

26:41.059 --> 26:44.161
Loved. I loved Grace.

26:44.196 --> 26:46.864
I wanted Grace to be the first
and only girl I ever had sex with.

26:46.898 --> 26:49.166
I wanted to marry her,
have babies with her.

26:49.201 --> 26:51.268
I loved her,

26:51.303 --> 26:53.003
but having sex with her

26:53.038 --> 26:54.939
messed up everything.

26:54.973 --> 26:57.808
That relationship totally
revolved around either having sex

26:57.843 --> 26:59.744
or not having sex.

26:59.778 --> 27:01.779
It was the issue that brought
us together and split us up.

27:01.813 --> 27:05.416
Then I hooked up with Madison.
I tried not to like her. I did.

27:05.450 --> 27:10.354
I tried to keep it to sex,
but I actually like her,

27:10.388 --> 27:11.922
and I think I was falling
in love with her,

27:11.957 --> 27:13.124
and then she calls me tonight

27:13.158 --> 27:14.725
and tells me
she's babysitting John

27:14.760 --> 27:16.861
and that she decided that she never
wants to have children or get married.

27:16.895 --> 27:18.162
And?

27:18.196 --> 27:19.563
And what's the point

27:19.598 --> 27:21.165
in being in a relationship
if at some point in the future

27:21.199 --> 27:23.667
there's no chance of having
babies or getting married,

27:23.702 --> 27:26.203
so I don't know if I feel
the same way about her

27:26.238 --> 27:30.040
if just having sex is really
going to be just having sex.

27:30.075 --> 27:31.575
But maybe if she knew that,
then...

27:31.610 --> 27:35.012
No. I'm just going to let it go
before letting it go hurts.

27:35.046 --> 27:36.514
You know what I mean?

27:36.548 --> 27:38.549
- Yeah.
- Hey, good luck.

27:38.583 --> 27:42.153
Let me know if there's anything
I can do other than hit you.

27:42.187 --> 27:43.954
Oh, go ahead and go
out the front door.

27:43.989 --> 27:45.823
Oh, thanks.
I wasn't sure.

27:48.960 --> 27:53.030
Oh, jeez, Betty.
What about Betty?

27:53.064 --> 27:54.865
Whoa, you startled me.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.567
You don't normally come
in the front door.

27:56.601 --> 27:58.669
Your friend was parked
out in the driveway.

27:58.703 --> 28:01.005
Ah.
I wanted to talk to you,

28:01.039 --> 28:02.907
but first I wanted to talk
to Ricky

28:02.941 --> 28:04.475
because Bunny's
worried about him,

28:04.509 --> 28:06.977
so I went over to the
apartment, and guess what?

28:07.012 --> 28:10.114
He's not there. None of his
things are there. He's gone.

28:16.103 --> 28:18.204
She's not answering.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.839
Oh, I just got
a text from her.

28:19.873 --> 28:21.273
She's okay.

28:21.308 --> 28:25.144
She went out to see...
Jimmy?

28:25.178 --> 28:27.446
She drove all the way to Palm
Springs on a school night?

28:27.481 --> 28:29.081
Apparently.

28:29.116 --> 28:31.083
Hey, did you know that Amy
was driving out to see Jimmy?

28:31.118 --> 28:32.651
I know. Good night.

28:32.686 --> 28:34.820
Wait a minute. Why do
you have two ginger ales?

28:34.855 --> 28:35.988
Who's the other one for?

28:36.022 --> 28:37.356
Good eye.
She's got a visitor...

28:37.390 --> 28:39.058
gay guy, friend of Griffin's.
I met him.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.493
Well, regardless,
I'd like to know

28:40.527 --> 28:41.861
when we have visitors here
or in your room.

28:41.895 --> 28:43.696
All right, Ashley?
Got it.

28:43.730 --> 28:46.665
Good night.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.401
Why would Amy go all the
way up there to see this guy

28:49.436 --> 28:51.170
when he hasn't called her
and won't answer her calls?

28:51.204 --> 28:53.139
I think that question
is the answer, isn't it?

28:53.173 --> 28:55.040
What's the answer
to the question I asked you?

28:55.075 --> 28:56.442
You going to marry me or not?

28:56.476 --> 28:57.877
What did you
and your shrink decide?

28:57.911 --> 29:00.312
We decided
that you're not funny.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.681
No. I know he thinks I'm funny.

29:02.716 --> 29:04.150
You know how?
I am funny.

29:04.184 --> 29:06.785
<i>[baby crying]</i>

29:06.820 --> 29:08.354
Did he tell you I'm funny?

29:08.388 --> 29:10.689
Huh? You ignored him because
he said I was funny, didn't he?

29:10.724 --> 29:11.957
[laughs]

29:11.992 --> 29:13.859
If you ever want this
to work out,

29:13.894 --> 29:16.896
don't pressure me about sex,
funny man.

29:16.930 --> 29:18.597
All right.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.568
And if I want to have sex,

29:22.602 --> 29:24.703
I'll let you know.

29:26.439 --> 29:28.040
He hasn't called.

29:28.074 --> 29:29.875
Why hasn't he called?

29:29.910 --> 29:32.378
Jesse hasn't
called me back either.

29:32.412 --> 29:33.979
Maybe there's no service,

29:34.014 --> 29:36.916
or maybe there's a big power
outage or something.

29:36.950 --> 29:38.584
<i>[baby crying]</i>

29:38.618 --> 29:40.152
[groans]
Is he crying again?

29:40.187 --> 29:42.188
What is wrong with him?

29:42.222 --> 29:44.857
You go.
Uh, it's your turn.

29:44.891 --> 29:46.592
You go. I went
the last two times.

29:46.626 --> 29:48.127
I changed his dirty diaper.

29:48.161 --> 29:51.263
Well, I'm tired, and I
want to go home, and...

29:51.298 --> 29:53.098
Oh, we have to go home.

29:53.133 --> 29:55.868
We can't drive past 11.
Let's go.

30:01.908 --> 30:04.944
Hey, we're very sorry,
but we don't want to be late

30:04.978 --> 30:07.146
and miss curfew and get
in trouble, so could you...

30:07.180 --> 30:09.515
Anne got him.
Oh, thank you.

30:09.549 --> 30:12.117
Did you guys find Amy?
Went to see Jimmy.

30:12.152 --> 30:13.786
Ooh, that's good.

30:13.820 --> 30:15.187
Really good.

30:15.222 --> 30:16.956
[Madison]
Yeah, she needs to move on.

30:16.990 --> 30:19.658
Ben slept with Adrian,
you know.

30:27.667 --> 30:29.134
[knock on door]
[sniffles]

30:29.169 --> 30:30.336
Good night.

30:30.370 --> 30:33.973
Adrian, it's me,
Tom Bowman.

30:34.007 --> 30:36.408
I don't want to see
anyone right now, Tom.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.911
I walked over here.
I'm tired.

30:45.185 --> 30:46.485
Hi.
Hi.

30:46.519 --> 30:48.687
You walked
all the way over here?

30:48.722 --> 30:51.390
I want to talk to you.
Your dad said I could.

30:51.424 --> 30:54.226
Tom, I can't believe you
walked all the way over here,

30:54.261 --> 30:56.262
but if you're just here
because...

30:56.296 --> 30:58.564
I'm back with Tammy.
[sighs]

30:58.598 --> 31:02.268
I'm here because my sister
is not kind to you,

31:02.302 --> 31:04.069
and I see you are hurting.

31:04.104 --> 31:07.973
Okay, come in,
but you can't stay.

31:08.008 --> 31:09.875
I don't feel like having
anyone around right now.

31:11.044 --> 31:13.579
Not even me?
Tom.

31:13.613 --> 31:17.383
Just want to make you smile.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.185
Yeah, like that.

31:20.220 --> 31:21.920
I love Ricky.

31:21.955 --> 31:26.091
I really love him, and I
was just so angry with him

31:26.126 --> 31:27.192
that he was with Amy,

31:27.227 --> 31:30.729
that I wanted to get
back at them.

31:30.764 --> 31:33.766
I have an anger problem, too.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.603
That's how Jack
got me going this week.

31:37.637 --> 31:39.505
Then I probably
should've called you.

31:39.539 --> 31:41.373
Next time?

31:41.408 --> 31:42.875
No, there isn't
going to be a next time.

31:42.909 --> 31:44.777
You don't know that.

31:44.811 --> 31:46.378
Yeah, I'm afraid I do.

31:46.413 --> 31:50.416
You should have called me.
You should have talked to me

31:50.450 --> 31:52.518
before you did
something stupid.

31:52.552 --> 31:54.119
And what would you have told me

31:54.154 --> 31:55.988
if I told you I was
going to have sex with Ben

31:56.022 --> 31:57.523
to get back at Amy and Ricky?

31:57.557 --> 32:01.994
I would have told you that
that's not what sex is for.

32:02.028 --> 32:04.196
Don't feel bad.

32:04.230 --> 32:05.664
People make mistakes.

32:05.699 --> 32:09.368
I make mistakes
all the time,

32:09.402 --> 32:11.970
and people still love me.

32:12.005 --> 32:13.906
No one is perfect.

32:13.940 --> 32:15.207
No one.

32:16.543 --> 32:18.410
Hi.

32:18.445 --> 32:20.779
Tom, Mom's in the car. We've
been looking everywhere for you.

32:20.814 --> 32:23.048
I was here.
Yeah, we figured that out.

32:23.083 --> 32:27.052
I really want to talk
to Adrian alone, please.

32:27.087 --> 32:29.922
Thanks for coming over, Tom.

32:29.956 --> 32:32.558
Good night. Sweet dreams.

32:38.064 --> 32:42.534
I just wanted to say that I'm really
sorry that I wasn't nicer to you

32:42.569 --> 32:43.535
when you came over earlier,

32:43.570 --> 32:45.938
but really as a friend

32:45.972 --> 32:47.506
I told you not to do
what you did,

32:47.540 --> 32:48.907
and you did it anyway,

32:48.942 --> 32:52.378
so it's kind of hard
to be sympathetic,

32:52.412 --> 32:54.213
but really we all
seem to do something

32:54.247 --> 32:56.482
that stops us
from getting what we want.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.417
We always keep sabotaging
ourselves.

32:58.451 --> 33:00.953
Maybe we just need to...
[phone ringing]

33:03.423 --> 33:06.158
It's Ben.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.660
Hi, Ben.
Hi, Grace.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.029
Uh, we should talk
about things.

33:11.064 --> 33:13.065
Right now I'm with Adrian.

33:13.099 --> 33:15.067
Oh, great.

33:15.101 --> 33:17.803
I need to talk to her, too,
but I was wondering.

33:17.837 --> 33:20.506
Have you seen Ricky tonight?
Has anyone seen Ricky tonight?

33:20.540 --> 33:22.040
You haven't seen
Ricky tonight, have you?

33:22.075 --> 33:23.308
No, I definitely haven't.

33:23.343 --> 33:25.577
And you, Grace,
you haven't seen Ricky?

33:25.612 --> 33:27.146
No, is something wrong?

33:27.180 --> 33:28.680
Is it? Something wrong?

33:28.715 --> 33:31.517
<i>He moved out of his apartment
without telling anyone.</i>

33:31.551 --> 33:34.653
He didn't leave a note. He's not
returning calls or texts or emails.

33:34.687 --> 33:36.522
<i>I called his old house,
his parents' house.</i>

33:36.556 --> 33:38.424
<i>They haven't seen him, and he
wasn't over at Amy's tonight.</i>

33:38.458 --> 33:41.293
Oh, wait. He moved out of his
apartment. What do you mean?

33:41.327 --> 33:44.129
Hi, Adrian.
Hi, Ben.

33:44.164 --> 33:45.264
How are you?

33:45.298 --> 33:46.665
Miserable.

33:46.699 --> 33:48.767
Yeah, I am, too,

33:48.802 --> 33:50.269
but we're still speaking
to each other?

33:50.303 --> 33:51.703
I hope so.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.072
Me, too,
and we should talk,

33:54.107 --> 33:56.475
but I think that for right now
we should try to find Ricky.

33:56.509 --> 33:58.777
He moved out?

33:58.812 --> 34:00.679
Apparently, yeah.

34:00.713 --> 34:02.247
[sighs]

34:06.830 --> 34:09.632
When she does get home, I
don't care what her mother says.

34:09.666 --> 34:11.534
I'm taking the keys.

34:11.568 --> 34:14.370
Here. Take the keys.

34:16.672 --> 34:18.007
Going to drive me
to school tomorrow?

34:18.041 --> 34:19.608
Pick me up and take me to work

34:19.643 --> 34:22.745
and pick me up after work
and take me by the market

34:22.779 --> 34:26.348
to get diapers or food
or whatever else John needs.

34:26.382 --> 34:28.484
You're not going to punish me
by driving me.

34:28.518 --> 34:30.585
I never get out of the house
by myself for myself,

34:30.620 --> 34:31.754
so tonight I did.

34:31.788 --> 34:33.422
Give me the keys.

34:34.757 --> 34:36.192
Sit down.

34:36.226 --> 34:38.060
I'm going to go tell Madison
and Lauren they can go home.

34:38.094 --> 34:40.196
They left an hour ago. They
both have to be home at 11,

34:40.230 --> 34:41.197
and so do you, young lady.

34:41.231 --> 34:43.532
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

34:43.567 --> 34:45.801
Did you see Ricky
on your travels tonight?

34:45.835 --> 34:46.869
No.
Did he call you tonight?

34:46.902 --> 34:48.437
No.
You have any idea where he is?

34:48.472 --> 34:49.938
No, I don't.
What's going on?

34:49.973 --> 34:51.407
Ben called here looking
for him.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.007
Ben's looking for Ricky?

34:53.043 --> 34:55.143
Hmm. I'm surprised Ricky's
not looking for Ben.

34:55.178 --> 34:56.478
He slept with Adrian.

34:56.513 --> 34:57.780
What?

34:57.814 --> 35:00.950
Yeah, apparently to get back
at Ricky for kissing me.

35:00.984 --> 35:02.685
She thought we did
something more than that.

35:02.719 --> 35:04.954
I don't know why everyone
thinks I'm having sex.

35:04.988 --> 35:06.455
Well, you did ask Ashley
for a condom.

35:06.490 --> 35:09.325
What? That's the first
I'm hearing about this.

35:11.995 --> 35:13.829
It's righteous indignation,
one of my favorites.

35:13.864 --> 35:15.030
All right, Ashley told me.

35:15.065 --> 35:17.199
I left my purse
in Jimmy's car,

35:17.234 --> 35:19.001
and when he went out
to get it for me,

35:19.035 --> 35:22.404
it slid off the seat
and fell onto the driveway.

35:22.439 --> 35:23.906
Everything
scattered everywhere,

35:23.940 --> 35:25.341
and he saw the condom.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.675
When he saw the condom,

35:26.710 --> 35:28.110
he thought I was lying
about when I had told him

35:28.145 --> 35:30.246
that I didn't want to have sex
again in high school

35:30.280 --> 35:32.148
and maybe not even
until I was married,

35:32.182 --> 35:34.984
so he didn't call me and he
didn't answer any of my calls

35:35.018 --> 35:36.752
because he didn't want
anything to do with me.

35:36.786 --> 35:38.320
Maybe like Ashley's friend,
Griffin's cousin.

35:38.355 --> 35:40.923
He's a really good-looking guy.
What's he talking about?

35:40.957 --> 35:43.359
Ashley's been hanging out
with Griffin's cousin.

35:43.393 --> 35:45.661
Oh, Grant?
Guy about, like, this tall,

35:45.695 --> 35:48.297
longish hair on top,
totally smitten with her?

35:49.299 --> 35:50.566
He's not gay.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.468
Who told you he was gay?

35:58.508 --> 36:00.109
So you went out to see Jimmy

36:00.143 --> 36:02.545
because you know you're not going
to see Ben again, didn't you?

36:02.579 --> 36:04.813
That's why you got up
the nerve to go track him down.

36:04.848 --> 36:06.248
Am I right?

36:06.283 --> 36:08.817
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I just decided to do it.

36:08.852 --> 36:11.487
And? And I know it was a school night,

36:11.521 --> 36:12.788
and I know
I should've asked first,

36:12.822 --> 36:15.691
but, Mom, I think we got
everything straightened out,

36:15.725 --> 36:17.826
like, I think he likes me,

36:17.861 --> 36:19.862
and I like him,

36:19.896 --> 36:21.664
but I know I'm 16,

36:21.698 --> 36:23.365
and I don't have time
for a boyfriend,

36:23.400 --> 36:26.602
but I really do like this guy,
Mom,

36:26.636 --> 36:27.970
and I hope he likes me

36:28.004 --> 36:29.972
because, oh, he's just funny.

36:30.006 --> 36:31.273
He makes me laugh,

36:31.308 --> 36:33.709
and I han't laughed
in a long, long time.

36:34.844 --> 36:38.447
[phone buzzing]

36:38.481 --> 36:39.815
[chuckles]

36:42.452 --> 36:43.986
You lied to me.

36:44.020 --> 36:45.788
I didn't lie.
You just assumed he was gay.

36:45.822 --> 36:47.756
You let me think he was gay.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.659
Dad, please don't be angry.
You'd really like this guy.

36:50.694 --> 36:52.494
I don't like any guy
who likes you.

36:52.529 --> 36:56.065
I know, and I love you
for that, but, Dad, I'm 15,

36:56.099 --> 36:57.399
and I'm going
into 10th grade next year.

36:57.434 --> 36:59.935
You're 14.
I just turned 15, Dad.

36:59.970 --> 37:01.804
No.
Yeah.

37:01.838 --> 37:03.072
Well, it's still
too young to date.

37:03.106 --> 37:04.540
Amy had a baby at 15.

37:04.574 --> 37:06.342
Which is why
you cannot date at 15.

37:06.376 --> 37:07.610
I'm not dating.

37:07.644 --> 37:09.612
I was just having Grant over,
getting to know him.

37:09.646 --> 37:11.046
Yeah, I'd like
to get to know him.

37:11.081 --> 37:12.514
Oh, would you?

37:12.549 --> 37:14.183
I could introduce you. He's
standing right in my closet.

37:14.217 --> 37:16.318
Wow.

37:18.622 --> 37:20.122
Hello, sir.

37:20.156 --> 37:23.392
I'm at fault for not speaking
up when you thought I was gay.

37:23.426 --> 37:25.394
You sure you're not gay? Maybe
you're just in the closet.

37:25.428 --> 37:27.930
Sir, I'm in a closet,
not the closet.

37:27.964 --> 37:29.231
I'm not gay.

37:29.266 --> 37:31.433
I'm in love with Ashley.

37:31.468 --> 37:33.035
We haven't discussed that yet.

37:33.069 --> 37:35.070
Yes, we have.

37:35.105 --> 37:39.341
I told her upon meeting her that I think
she's the most beautiful girl in the world

37:39.376 --> 37:40.643
and that I love her.

37:40.677 --> 37:42.278
You know how it is.

37:42.312 --> 37:44.680
Yeah, I know how it is.

37:44.714 --> 37:48.183
Say good night and then...

37:48.218 --> 37:49.885
It's late.
How old are you?

37:49.919 --> 37:51.420
I'm 16.

37:51.454 --> 37:53.255
I have a provisional license
with a curfew.

37:53.290 --> 37:55.291
[sighs]

37:55.325 --> 37:57.993
All right, well,
I trust her completely,

37:58.028 --> 38:00.296
so if you want to sleep
on the couch over there,

38:00.330 --> 38:03.499
you're welcome to stay
on the couch.

38:03.533 --> 38:06.735
Thank you, sir, and I
won't abuse the privilege.

38:06.770 --> 38:09.038
Good night, Ash.

38:11.708 --> 38:13.042
Well.

38:13.076 --> 38:15.210
I have to go now.
Good night.

38:15.245 --> 38:16.612
But he said you could stay.

38:16.646 --> 38:18.647
Yeah, it was a test.

38:18.682 --> 38:21.884
He said I could stay.
That means I can't stay.

38:23.253 --> 38:25.120
Good man.
See you next week.

38:41.838 --> 38:45.040
Remember when we first met
and everything was fun,

38:45.075 --> 38:46.642
and I made you laugh,
and you made me laugh,

38:46.676 --> 38:49.611
and we couldn't wait to be
with each other?

38:49.646 --> 38:51.380
That was
the best time of my life.

38:51.414 --> 38:53.082
Remember how that felt?
Yeah, I do.

38:53.116 --> 38:54.450
Not being sure
of what would happen

38:54.484 --> 38:55.751
was exciting back then,
remember?

38:55.785 --> 38:57.119
Yeah, I remember.

38:57.153 --> 38:58.987
Come on, Anne.

38:59.022 --> 39:02.791
What was it they used to say? The
flipside of fear is excitement?

39:04.194 --> 39:05.994
I'd be really excited
to be with you again.

39:06.029 --> 39:08.063
I really would.

39:09.065 --> 39:11.867
Hey, go to bed.

39:11.901 --> 39:13.936
I've got people
who can find him.

39:13.970 --> 39:15.904
We'll find him.

39:15.939 --> 39:18.040
Did you talk to his parents?

39:18.074 --> 39:21.677
Yeah, his mom had a few
suggestions as to where he might be.

39:21.711 --> 39:23.345
Said he used to do this
when he was a kid.

39:23.380 --> 39:26.949
In foster care
he used to run away,

39:26.983 --> 39:28.751
so he knows
how to take care of himself.

39:28.785 --> 39:30.619
He'll come around,

39:30.653 --> 39:33.222
and when he does come around,
you're going to talk to him.

39:33.256 --> 39:35.591
He was your friend, Ben.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.493
He's probably not going to want
to be your friend now,

39:37.527 --> 39:39.094
but you owe it to him
to talk to him

39:39.129 --> 39:40.462
and hear
what he has to say to you.

39:40.497 --> 39:41.930
He kissed Amy.

39:41.965 --> 39:43.832
You're not with Amy anymore.

39:43.867 --> 39:45.601
Nor will I ever be again.

39:45.635 --> 39:49.304
Yeah, well, you're just going to have
to accept responsibility for this,

39:49.339 --> 39:51.473
and get ready to learn some
of life's toughest lessons.

39:51.508 --> 39:54.910
It's hard enough to lose someone
when they pass away, like your mother,

39:54.944 --> 39:57.479
but that was
out of our control.

39:57.514 --> 39:59.281
I mean, losing a friend

39:59.315 --> 40:01.450
by doing something
dishonorable, like you did,

40:01.484 --> 40:03.352
well, that's plenty painful,
too,

40:03.386 --> 40:05.454
especially when you know
that didn't have to happen.

40:05.488 --> 40:06.789
You made it happen.

40:06.823 --> 40:08.524
It was under your control.
You knew it was wrong.

40:08.558 --> 40:11.593
You did it anyway, and those are
the worst mistakes you can make.

40:11.628 --> 40:13.228
I'd like to know
what your thinking was,

40:13.263 --> 40:14.596
and don't blame it on Adrian.

40:14.631 --> 40:16.598
I can't stand
when people make mistakes

40:16.633 --> 40:18.534
and blame it on someone else.

40:18.568 --> 40:23.439
I thought I could ignore
that Amy had sex with Ricky

40:23.473 --> 40:25.307
even though she was pregnant.

40:25.341 --> 40:28.277
I thought I could ignore
that it was his baby

40:28.311 --> 40:29.812
because I really loved her,

40:29.846 --> 40:31.847
and I thought that,
as time went by,

40:31.881 --> 40:33.382
she and I
would love each other

40:33.416 --> 40:34.583
more and more,

40:34.617 --> 40:36.485
and the fact
that she was ever with him

40:36.519 --> 40:40.189
would bother me less and less,
and that just didn't happen.

40:40.223 --> 40:41.290
In fact the opposite happened.

40:41.324 --> 40:42.524
I couldn't understand

40:42.559 --> 40:44.226
how the woman I loved

40:44.260 --> 40:47.563
would ever be with him.

40:47.597 --> 40:50.699
He was with her,
so I wanted to be with her.

40:50.733 --> 40:52.601
I mean, after all,
I'm the one who loved her.

40:52.635 --> 40:54.369
I'm the one who held her hand

40:54.404 --> 40:56.905
and supported her
every day until John was born.

40:56.940 --> 40:58.540
Amy was my girlfriend,

40:58.575 --> 41:03.045
and yet there was no way she
was ever going to be with me,

41:03.079 --> 41:04.780
not in the next decade
anyway,

41:04.814 --> 41:07.015
so I wanted
what I didn't have with Amy.

41:07.050 --> 41:09.218
I wanted an uncomplicated
relationship

41:09.252 --> 41:10.519
that was fun,

41:10.553 --> 41:12.921
and that
had some sex involved,

41:12.956 --> 41:16.758
and that was Maria.

41:16.793 --> 41:17.926
I like Maria.

41:17.961 --> 41:19.294
I like her a lot,

41:19.329 --> 41:21.230
and just for the record,

41:21.264 --> 41:22.531
we fooled around a little,

41:22.565 --> 41:23.765
but we never had sex,

41:23.800 --> 41:26.001
and even if we did,

41:26.035 --> 41:27.903
she's not here.

41:27.937 --> 41:30.372
Even if she was,
she's not Amy,

41:30.406 --> 41:31.707
and neither is Grace,

41:31.741 --> 41:32.941
and neither
is any other girl.

41:32.976 --> 41:36.178
I want Amy.
I want her back.

41:36.212 --> 41:38.213
So you went
and had sex with Adrian.

41:38.248 --> 41:39.982
I didn't do anything
that Amy didn't do.

41:40.016 --> 41:41.984
I didn't plan on having sex
with Adrian.

41:42.018 --> 41:44.553
It just happened.

41:44.587 --> 41:46.088
I went to go talk to Amy,

41:46.122 --> 41:48.724
and she didn't want anything
to do with me,

41:48.758 --> 41:51.326
so I was just sitting
in my car

41:51.361 --> 41:53.562
lost in my own painful thoughts

41:53.596 --> 41:55.030
when Adrian came
out to the car.

41:55.064 --> 41:56.298
And made you feel better.

41:56.332 --> 41:58.800
- For a while, yes.
- And how are you feeling now?

41:58.835 --> 42:02.704
Like hell, Dad, like hell.
You satisfied?

42:02.739 --> 42:04.506
No. No, Ben, I'm not.

42:04.541 --> 42:06.208
You had sex
for the first time...

42:06.242 --> 42:08.343
I mean,
this was your first time...

42:08.378 --> 42:10.312
in a car with Adrian?

42:10.346 --> 42:11.780
I didn't mean
for it to happen.

42:11.814 --> 42:14.316
I just... I keep doing things
and saying things

42:14.350 --> 42:15.584
without thinking.

42:15.618 --> 42:17.152
There's more?
What else would you do?

42:17.186 --> 42:18.754
Hey, Leo?

42:18.788 --> 42:22.958
Why don't you two boys
take a break

42:22.992 --> 42:25.127
before something's said
between the two of you

42:25.161 --> 42:27.563
that you wish you hadn't said.
It's late.

42:27.597 --> 42:28.697
Smart man knows
when to take advice.

42:28.731 --> 42:30.566
Let's take Betty's advice, huh?

42:30.600 --> 42:32.901
Because I don't think I could hear
much more of what I heard tonight

42:32.936 --> 42:35.370
without doing or saying
something stupid myself.

42:36.773 --> 42:38.607
Thanks, Dad, and...

42:38.641 --> 42:39.942
thanks, Betty.

42:39.976 --> 42:41.343
Sure, kid.

42:43.913 --> 42:46.214
I love you, Ben.
Good night.

42:47.283 --> 42:49.251
Wait, Betty.

42:50.887 --> 42:51.920
I'm sor...

42:53.056 --> 42:54.790
Thank you.

42:57.260 --> 43:00.495
Good night.
Love you.
