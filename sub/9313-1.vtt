03:39.619 --> 03:43.885
I think he's a pirate.
I think they've got a bIack one.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.323
Send two more bunches,
not too ripe, before Sunday.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.452
Me pIeasure,
Mr. CuIverweII.

03:51.030 --> 03:54.056
Did Mr. Durant Iike them
I sent him yesterday ;

03:54.200 --> 03:57.294
- WouId I be back today if not ;
- Thank you, sir.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.201
Thank you and Lord Durant.

04:02.642 --> 04:05.577
- What they doin' there ;
- Stringin' up another pirate.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.865
Get your bIeeding foot
out of my ear.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.131
Give us a hand here !

04:33.239 --> 04:35.605
Get them sIops out of here.

04:35.708 --> 04:39.769
Put on that Iine.
HoId stiII.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.258
- CorporaI, the orders !
- Sir. Yes, sir.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.492
No, CorporaI, read it.
Read it !

04:57.597 --> 04:59.121
Oh. Yes, sir.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.826
''I, James Durant,

05:01.934 --> 05:06.769
''in my capacity as acting Governor
and acting Lord High Justice,

05:06.873 --> 05:10.809
do hereby decree that
at dawn on the morrow--''

05:10.910 --> 05:13.743
- We're a bit tardy, sir.
- Never mind.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.872
- Get to the gist of it
before we're obsoIete.
- Yes, sir.

05:17.016 --> 05:19.712
''That the maIefactor,
one Nick Debrett,

05:19.819 --> 05:23.016
''wiII be hanged
from the neck untiI dead.

05:23.122 --> 05:26.023
''And he shaII be Ieft
to hang untiI carrions...

05:26.125 --> 05:28.457
''shaII reduce his body
to bones.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.756
''For the moraI benefit
to the peopIe...

05:30.863 --> 05:33.730
''by their witnessing
the execution...

05:33.833 --> 05:37.360
''and rotting of the body,

05:37.470 --> 05:40.462
-''a usefuI Iesson in duty and obedience,
-Bastards.

05:40.606 --> 05:44.007
''and a strong admonition
to repentance...

05:44.143 --> 05:48.011
''from the heavy hand of justice
so near their streets.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.674
''Signed James Durant,
acting Governor...

05:50.783 --> 05:53.445
and acting
Lord High Justice.''

05:53.553 --> 05:55.748
Very good, CorporaI.
Let us proceed !

05:55.855 --> 06:00.087
I find no prayer
for a pirate, Major.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.956
I stayed up aII night
searching,

06:02.061 --> 06:06.054
but the cIosest I couId find
was something by Peter... for fishermen.

06:06.165 --> 06:09.100
That shouId do niceIy.
PIease, carry on.

06:15.174 --> 06:17.574
Has he Iived
a reIigious Iife, sir ;

06:17.677 --> 06:19.372
No matter.

06:19.479 --> 06:23.006
He shaII die a reIigious death.
Proceed !

06:23.116 --> 06:25.949
''I shaII cast my net
out into the sea.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.044
The fish caught in that net
are the fish of the Lord--''

06:29.155 --> 06:31.885
Fine. Now if
the chapIain is finished.

06:31.991 --> 06:34.585
Y-Yes, sir.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.560
Check the trapdoor, CorporaI.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.998
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.238
The hood, sir.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.647
The man's a pirate, not a prince.
Let the drums sound !

07:03.556 --> 07:05.421
AII right.

07:07.527 --> 07:11.258
Cinch up, PoIonski !
There's work to be done.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.179
- Sir ;
- Not another word, CorporaI.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.984
- But, sir !
- CorporaI !

07:38.090 --> 07:40.558
Not one more word.

07:52.438 --> 07:55.134
- That'II teach you, Durant !

07:55.274 --> 07:57.299
BIow 'em to heII !

07:58.711 --> 08:00.508
That a Iads !

08:00.613 --> 08:02.979
- What ship is that ;
- The BIarney Cock, WiIIard.

08:03.082 --> 08:07.212
Pretty as a picture she is too.
Beg pardon, sir.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.347
TeII Lord Durant I'II
send him the very best.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.322
CorporaI !
Return their fire !

08:16.429 --> 08:19.990
Return their fire !

08:23.536 --> 08:25.834
That a way, Iads.

08:25.938 --> 08:29.032
Let's give 'em one more,
for Nick Debrett !

08:32.111 --> 08:36.571
- Why don't they fire ;
- The guns were for ornamentation, sir.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.014
It was to be a hanging,
not a firing squad.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.685
Fire four !

08:48.394 --> 08:50.589
Fire three !

08:52.865 --> 08:54.992
Sweet Jesus !

09:06.546 --> 09:10.243
- CIear the port tops'I.
- Lower the mast !

09:15.388 --> 09:17.322
There's two men !
Fire on them.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.057
Somebody fire on them !

09:25.164 --> 09:28.065
SoIdier, stay and fight !
Where's your heart, man ;

09:39.579 --> 09:42.605
Steady as she goes,
my friend.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.684
Steady as she goes !

09:54.794 --> 09:57.354
Now you got it.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.488
What the deviI ;

10:03.336 --> 10:05.702
Thank you, Ned.

10:05.805 --> 10:08.569
Lift saiI !

10:14.880 --> 10:16.939
Give 'em one more, boys.
Fire at wiII.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.228
Yeah !

10:45.011 --> 10:47.275
I'II see you hang,
Ned Lynch !

10:47.380 --> 10:49.814
And by my own hand !

10:49.915 --> 10:52.042
Major,

10:52.151 --> 10:56.144
I think it wiII have to be
by a very Iong rope !

11:03.095 --> 11:05.063
You there, stand !

11:53.145 --> 11:55.579
There's been a probIem
at the hanging.

11:55.681 --> 11:59.139
Major FoIIy has aIIowed
the pirate prisoner to escape.

11:59.251 --> 12:01.412
That stupid, stupid
bIundering fooI !

12:03.255 --> 12:07.351
I entrust him with a simpIe execution,
and this is how he shows his thanks.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.327
By Iosing the prisoner
aItogether !

12:10.463 --> 12:12.988
He was taken right off
the gaIIows...

12:13.132 --> 12:16.067
from under Major FoIIy's nose
by the crew of the BIarney Cock,

12:16.202 --> 12:20.605
and, of course,
Captain Ned Lynch.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.641
Of course it wouId be
Ned Lynch.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.234
Damn his common souI !

12:26.345 --> 12:30.111
If I ever see him,
he wiII die.

12:30.216 --> 12:34.050
Stop the carriage
at the entrance. Take out the prisoner.

12:43.796 --> 12:47.493
It's Sir James Barnet,
the Lord Chief Justice, in chains, sir.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.330
The former
Lord Chief Justice.

12:50.436 --> 12:54.099
Have him taken
to the gymnasium.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.922
Am I to stand here
aII day, Lord Durant ;

13:20.900 --> 13:24.267
Sir James,
how good of you to come.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.469
You wiII excuse me,
I trust,

13:30.609 --> 13:33.043
if I continue with my practice
whiIe we speak.

13:43.355 --> 13:46.984
I have so IittIe time
for the pIeasures in Iife.

13:47.092 --> 13:49.322
You'II understand,
I'm sure.

13:49.428 --> 13:52.329
I trust you've not
suffered discomfort, Sir James.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.863
Is that why you had me
brought here in chains ;

13:58.003 --> 14:01.734
To inquire as to whether
they are a proper fit ;

14:01.841 --> 14:04.571
I never reaIIy thought
of myseIf as a crueI man,

14:04.677 --> 14:06.872
onIy a cIever one.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.539
But not cIever enough
to deceive the peopIe of Kingston.

14:09.648 --> 14:13.209
The peopIe, Durant !
Not your Iackeys and hired assassins.

14:35.307 --> 14:36.706
En garde.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.471
You must understand, Sir James,
that you are mereIy a pawn.

14:39.578 --> 14:43.070
A rebeIIious one, to be sure,
but a pawn aII the same.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.275
And I must remove you
from the pIaying board.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.148
To rape the peopIe.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.586
That's a harsh description.
I think of it as payment due.

14:50.689 --> 14:54.250
- Payment for what ;
- For the years I've suffered
on these fiIthy isIands.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.521
For the hours I've had to
endure such insufferabIe...

14:57.630 --> 15:00.861
righteous bores
such as yourseIf, Sir James !

15:00.966 --> 15:03.696
AII that is insufferabIe,
Lord Durant, is you.

15:03.802 --> 15:06.566
My onIy faiIure has been
in not being abIe to expose you...

15:06.672 --> 15:08.572
and the wickedness you represent.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.973
Hear this, sir.
As sure as I stand before you now...

15:12.077 --> 15:15.240
others wiII come,
and you shaII not succeed, but die,

15:15.347 --> 15:17.645
and men
shaII dance on your grave.

15:23.322 --> 15:26.120
You are in no position
to make threats, Sir James.

15:26.225 --> 15:29.820
UnIock these chains
and I'II do far more than that !

15:29.929 --> 15:32.921
You wiII do nothing
but what I direct you to do.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.203
I grow weary of this debate
and tired of the sight of you.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.209
My finaI words are thus:

16:19.311 --> 16:22.747
AII your Iands and property
are forfeit to the crown.

16:22.848 --> 16:26.249
Your dear wife and daughter
can find a new home...

16:26.352 --> 16:28.650
in whatever sIum
appeaIs to them.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.215
And you, Sir James,

16:32.324 --> 16:36.055
shaII be removed at once
to the fortress.

16:36.161 --> 16:40.097
There to serve a sentence for
a Iength of time that suits my pIeasure.

16:43.135 --> 16:45.569
Fine. Over to
the second wagon, pIease.

16:47.373 --> 16:50.399
Second wagon.
Second.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.670
You men,
bring horses from the stabIes.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.212
Put that in the third wagon.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.982
HandIe that carefuIIy !

16:59.084 --> 17:00.847
CarefuI with
Sir James' headboard.

17:00.953 --> 17:04.012
Lord Durant's headboard.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.249
CarefuI, private, carefuI.

17:06.392 --> 17:10.192
This is no picnic.
Keep your men moving there.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.855
Straighten your beIt.
Stand up straight, young man.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.898
Guards, attention !

17:32.084 --> 17:35.747
Madam, I wiII have
to examine your bags.

17:35.854 --> 17:40.484
- You wiII do nothing of the kind.
- I have my orders.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.617
Damn your orders.

17:48.467 --> 17:52.801
Lady Barnet, I apoIogize
for the inconvenience,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.999
but it wiII be necessary
for you to do as requested.

17:56.108 --> 17:59.168
I wiII cut them off
if you persist.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.616
However, I think it is safe to assume
that Lady Barnet and her daughter...

18:05.751 --> 18:07.651
wouId not attempt to deceive us...

18:07.753 --> 18:09.653
by secreting vaIuabIe cargo
in their vaIises.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.019
- Don't you think ;
- WeII, sir--

18:12.124 --> 18:14.024
- You agree, do you not ;
- CertainIy, sir.

18:14.126 --> 18:16.424
Right, then.
Let the women pass...

18:16.528 --> 18:18.860
and Iet the coach Ieave
unmoIested.

18:41.453 --> 18:46.015
- You two take this to the first wagon.
- Not there !

18:46.158 --> 18:48.649
- There ! In my coach !
- Not there !

18:48.794 --> 18:51.786
There, in the major's coach.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.967
CorporaI, proceed !

18:57.069 --> 18:59.037
Proceed !

19:15.120 --> 19:19.181
There was a young Iady...

19:19.291 --> 19:21.418
from MaIta...

19:21.527 --> 19:25.623
who swooned on the boat
to GibraItar.

19:25.731 --> 19:30.065
Though she Iost her virginity
in that vicinity,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.569
she stiII made her way
to the aItar.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.374
Ahh, yes.

19:40.479 --> 19:44.040
There once was a Iady
named Starkie...

19:44.149 --> 19:47.050
who had an affair
with a darkie.

19:47.152 --> 19:50.349
The resuIt of her sins
was quadrupIets,

19:50.455 --> 19:52.355
not twins,

19:52.457 --> 19:56.860
one bIack, one white, two khaki.

19:59.865 --> 20:04.063
I once went to bed
with a Quaker.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.730
In the morning,
I just couIdn't wake her.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.274
So I sauntered away
and I spent the whoIe day...

20:11.376 --> 20:15.437
with a IoveIy young thing
from Jamaica.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.244
Ahh.

20:19.351 --> 20:22.843
Hmm.

20:22.955 --> 20:27.392
There was a young girI
whose frigidity-- What ;

20:27.492 --> 20:30.222
Nick.

20:30.362 --> 20:34.594
I feeI a trembIin' beneath my spine.
I think it's a coach.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.760
Two horses--

20:37.869 --> 20:39.769
No, four horses,

20:39.871 --> 20:43.830
one bIack, one white,
and two khaki.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.847
Hey yup !

20:49.948 --> 20:54.681
Hey yup !
Hey yup !

20:54.786 --> 20:57.812
There was a young girI
whose frigidity--

20:59.291 --> 21:01.623
That's right, go on.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.428
Approached cataIeptic
rigidity.

21:05.530 --> 21:09.830
TiII he gave her a drink
which she quickIy wouId sink--

21:09.935 --> 21:12.927
In a state of
compIacent Iiquidity.

21:17.075 --> 21:19.009
Hurry it up, Nick !

21:30.622 --> 21:33.716
Hey yup !
Hey yup !

21:36.295 --> 21:38.195
Hey yup !

21:42.000 --> 21:44.696
Hey yup !

21:44.803 --> 21:47.397
Hey yup !

21:47.506 --> 21:50.566
Hey yup !
Hey yup !

21:53.378 --> 21:55.539
Hey yup !

22:00.185 --> 22:01.777
Hey yup !

22:05.724 --> 22:08.716
Hey yup !

22:27.045 --> 22:29.206
Hey yup !

22:31.883 --> 22:34.010
Hey yup !

22:35.620 --> 22:39.056
There once was
a young major named FoIIy.

22:39.157 --> 22:41.057
Hey yup !

23:10.255 --> 23:13.520
You know, that's not
a very good book, Major FoIIy.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.325
ActuaIIy, there's another work
on the same subject...

23:17.429 --> 23:19.556
done by MoIIet and Van der Veer.

23:19.664 --> 23:21.598
It's far more comprehensive.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.941
I swore to you once,

23:32.043 --> 23:34.705
and I'II swear to you again,
Captain Lynch !

23:34.813 --> 23:37.008
I wiII see you hang.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.049
I think your man's upset, Nick.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.483
So it seems, Captain.
What a shame.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.487
I'm beginning to doubt
he'd accept my apoIogy.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.489
Which apoIogy is that ;

23:46.591 --> 23:48.752
For Ieavin' my hanging
in such a hurry...

23:48.860 --> 23:52.591
that I didn't have time to thank him
for his hospitaIity.

23:53.698 --> 23:56.826
WeII now, Nick,

23:56.935 --> 24:00.302
aII a man can do
is Iive an honorabIe Iife.

24:00.405 --> 24:03.533
Be kind to women, to animaIs,

24:03.675 --> 24:07.771
and to treat his feIIow man
as he wishes to be treated himseIf.

24:13.585 --> 24:16.383
- So be it.
- Thank you, Nick.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.864
Good Iuck, Major FoIIy.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.230
Better days ahead.

24:39.444 --> 24:42.277
Come on, heIp me in.
Whoop !

24:42.380 --> 24:45.907
Come on, PoIonski.
Get your PoIish backside in there.

24:48.553 --> 24:52.216
A major's Iife
is not an easy one !

25:05.904 --> 25:09.271
Isn't that
Sir James Barnet's coach ;

25:09.374 --> 25:11.865
Have a orange, miIady !

25:36.234 --> 25:39.169
- We're here, Mother.
- It's Sir James' famiIy.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.604
Leave 'em aIone.
They've probIems enough tonight.

25:47.012 --> 25:49.947
Lady, pIease.
Thank you.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.477
Isn't it nice ;
Isn't it IoveIy ;

25:55.954 --> 25:58.787
It does not pIease miIady ;

25:58.890 --> 26:03.224
- Leave us aIone.
- Indeed I wiII, after I've been paid.

26:06.331 --> 26:09.232
It's far too much
for a rat hoIe Iike this.

26:09.334 --> 26:11.632
Watch your tongue, miIady.

26:13.471 --> 26:18.204
UnIike you, I am
where I choose to be.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.881
Father wiII be free.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.446
And Durant wiII pay.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.544
I promise.

27:08.159 --> 27:10.093
¶ I'II get for you a goIden ring ¶

27:10.228 --> 27:13.891
¶ Oh, yes, oh ¶

27:13.999 --> 27:17.366
¶ I promised you
my IittIe thing ¶

27:17.469 --> 27:20.461
¶ A hundred years ago ¶¶

27:22.974 --> 27:25.374
Mate, Iend a hand ;

27:46.231 --> 27:48.199
Not those, my angeIs.

27:48.299 --> 27:50.164
Here. Bookends.

27:50.268 --> 27:54.796
FiII the empty space between with books.
Better than your body jeweIs.

27:54.906 --> 27:59.343
What good is a decorated neck
when an empty head is perched on top ;

27:59.444 --> 28:01.708
Better an empty head
than an empty bed.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.314
AII right, Iads,
quiet now. Quiet.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.411
Listen to your captain.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.355
Division of the spoiIs...
eight beIIs.

28:15.927 --> 28:20.864
AII right, girIs.
I hoId you responsibIe, Mr. Moonbeam.

28:20.965 --> 28:22.865
Aye, Captain.

28:24.002 --> 28:26.027
Look at the brooch
he picked up.

28:26.171 --> 28:29.834
GirIs, here's something
for you.

28:29.941 --> 28:33.001
Nobody gave me nothin' Iike that.

28:36.948 --> 28:39.178
AII right, Iads.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.912
SIeep weII.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.632
I pIead with you, Lord Durant,

28:54.766 --> 28:57.394
to give me one Iast chance.

28:57.502 --> 29:01.768
One finaI opportunity
to redeem myseIf in your nobIe eyes.

29:01.873 --> 29:05.036
As God as my witness,
I shaII not faiI you again.

29:05.143 --> 29:07.407
First the pirate prisoner,
then the Barnet fortune...

29:07.512 --> 29:09.503
which I entrusted to you.

29:09.614 --> 29:13.141
Whatever shaII I do with you,
Major FoIIy ;

29:13.251 --> 29:15.913
Take off your coat, Major.

29:37.142 --> 29:39.576
And the vest.

29:41.246 --> 29:43.237
- Beg your pardon ;
- The vest !

29:51.756 --> 29:54.156
And the shirt as weII.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.890
You may sit down, Major.

30:36.935 --> 30:38.994
At ease, Major.

30:41.973 --> 30:43.941
RecIine !

30:56.354 --> 30:58.822
You may begin.

31:44.469 --> 31:48.337
Suffering becomes
aII mankind.

31:48.439 --> 31:52.603
But it finds its most perfect expression
in the faces of the young.

31:56.714 --> 31:59.342
At present it is onIy
a game, young Major.

31:59.484 --> 32:03.648
But next time, who knows how serious
the consequences might be ;

32:07.358 --> 32:11.260
Dagon ! Time enough.

32:11.362 --> 32:13.557
Remove the wax.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.888
Cudjo !

33:14.993 --> 33:18.895
Where have you been,
my very Iarge friend ;

33:18.997 --> 33:21.591
I've been abroad, LittIe Nick.
Abroad.

33:21.733 --> 33:25.533
IsIand hopping.
FoIIowing the wind, free Iike a bird...

33:25.636 --> 33:28.969
and pinching a pIump behind
everywhere I couId find one.

33:29.073 --> 33:32.600
And you, LittIe Nick.
The taIes I'm toId.

33:32.710 --> 33:36.646
A scoundreI.
Nick Debrett, a brigand.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.774
AII true, my friend,
and much worse.

33:41.252 --> 33:44.779
And that gentIeman whose nose
I came so cIose to removing ;

33:44.922 --> 33:46.822
Red Ned Lynch.

33:46.924 --> 33:49.757
- Cudjo QuarreI.
- It's an honor, Captain Lynch.

33:49.861 --> 33:54.457
WeII, Mr. Cudjo,
how'd you come to know my friend ;

33:54.565 --> 33:57.534
LittIe Nick and I
shared many a Iength of chain.

33:57.635 --> 34:01.935
When the day came that we finaIIy
grew tired of each other's company,

34:02.040 --> 34:04.235
there was onIy one thing
for us to do.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.968
We bIew our separate ways
Iike free men wiII.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.206
It's good to be
on the same tack again.

34:10.348 --> 34:13.748
Breezes tend to bIow that way,
oId friend.

34:13.851 --> 34:18.311
Cudjo, it's aIways a pIeasure
to know a friend of a friend.

35:00.798 --> 35:03.494
Give me a kiss.

35:09.874 --> 35:12.707
Ned, I've missed you !

35:14.245 --> 35:16.406
- He didn't miss you.
- Oh, weII.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.514
You remember me ;

35:35.533 --> 35:38.263
She's cIean, huh ;

35:46.677 --> 35:48.736
Where did you get this ;

35:48.880 --> 35:51.371
Let go of it.
It's mine. It's mine !

35:51.516 --> 35:55.577
TeII me.
Where did you get this ;

35:57.455 --> 36:01.619
- Where did you get it ;
- As a matter of fact, I gave it to her.

36:07.431 --> 36:09.399
Where did you get it ;

36:13.271 --> 36:16.240
Where does Ned Lynch get anything ;

36:43.634 --> 36:47.798
- Six to four on Lynch's whore.
- And three to one on the IittIe whore.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.873
That's not a whore.

36:50.975 --> 36:52.909
That's Sir James' daughter.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.877
One man's daughter is another man's
whore. I'II take your bet.

37:13.631 --> 37:15.189
Aha !

37:29.247 --> 37:32.216
Captain, I think
she just earned it.

37:32.350 --> 37:35.615
I didn't earn it.
I own it !

37:40.157 --> 37:45.117
''To my Ioving daughter
Jane, from her father.''

37:45.229 --> 37:47.129
Your father's
Sir James Barnet ;

37:47.231 --> 37:49.131
Yes.

37:49.233 --> 37:51.098
Sir James' daughter !

37:52.470 --> 37:54.097
Yes ;

37:54.205 --> 37:56.105
Yes !

37:59.644 --> 38:02.135
Thank you, ma'am.

38:05.650 --> 38:08.210
There he is !
Seize him !

38:47.124 --> 38:49.524
Get her !
Get the murdering wench !

39:13.818 --> 39:15.752
Watch out, Ned !

39:24.161 --> 39:26.186
Stop 'im !

39:45.216 --> 39:48.708
Oh, God !
Oh, my God !

39:48.853 --> 39:52.016
- Can't a man have some peace ;
- OnIy in heaven, sir.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.238
Heads up, Iads !

40:16.480 --> 40:18.471
Come on, girI.

40:23.854 --> 40:27.620
Too far to jump.
Can't get you up on the roof.

40:27.725 --> 40:29.625
Wanna waIk the pIank ;

40:44.975 --> 40:47.876
Come on, Miss Barnet.
It's easy.

40:50.147 --> 40:52.377
Take my wrist, girI.

40:55.653 --> 40:58.554
Come on.

40:58.656 --> 41:00.783
Don't crowd me, girI.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.654
Make room for me !

41:04.295 --> 41:06.320
Come on, Nick !

41:13.003 --> 41:16.029
- What kept you ;
- Come on, you crazy fooI.

41:29.119 --> 41:34.250
WeII, not a second to Iose,
as they say.

41:36.961 --> 41:39.589
Hey ! No !

41:39.697 --> 41:42.928
No !

41:43.033 --> 41:46.127
- It works. You're next.
- Not me, mate.

41:46.237 --> 41:49.570
AII right.
Then both at once !

41:51.475 --> 41:54.103
- Here they come.

41:55.713 --> 41:57.613
Come on !

42:05.523 --> 42:07.218
After them !

42:09.593 --> 42:12.027
Somebody stop them !

42:34.485 --> 42:36.817
Throw her in.

42:36.921 --> 42:38.821
Excuse me, sir.

42:41.759 --> 42:45.752
- Hey yup ! Hey !
- Thief ! Come back with me wagon !

42:45.863 --> 42:48.798
After them !
Get the horses !

42:55.940 --> 42:58.841
Come on, get up !
See what they've done ;

42:58.943 --> 43:03.175
They've stoIen me wagon !
Bring back me bananas !

43:06.884 --> 43:10.615
Nick, mustn't forget
to pay for the damage !

43:10.721 --> 43:12.814
Thank you for
your aid, madam.

43:12.923 --> 43:16.757
- I fought for my Iife, not yours.
- I thank you anyway.

43:16.894 --> 43:19.488
Ned, company !

43:19.630 --> 43:21.689
We'II take a shortcut then.

43:21.832 --> 43:25.563
Hey yup ! Hey yup !
Hey yup !

43:41.285 --> 43:43.412
Hey yup !

44:04.108 --> 44:06.099
Hey yup !

44:18.022 --> 44:20.388
Look.

44:35.639 --> 44:36.936
Hey yup !

45:18.248 --> 45:22.446
- Ask the Iady if she can swim.
- What ;

45:22.553 --> 45:27.252
Ask the Iady if she can S-W-I-M.
Swim !

45:27.357 --> 45:30.849
- Why ;
- Because--

45:58.222 --> 46:00.087
You're a madman.

46:00.190 --> 46:04.126
Yes, dear.
But a Iive one, at Ieast.

47:02.252 --> 47:04.686
Fancy the Iass ;

47:04.788 --> 47:06.779
That I do.

47:06.890 --> 47:10.417
No wonder.
A IoveIy creature she is.

47:10.561 --> 47:14.429
I'd give a pretty penny
to spend an hour with that.

47:14.531 --> 47:19.195
- WouId you now ;
- Aye, that I wouId.

47:19.303 --> 47:21.271
A pretty penny.

47:21.371 --> 47:25.899
The question is, wouId you be
wiIIing to give your Iife for it ;

48:11.455 --> 48:13.923
How Iong have you
been sitting there ;

48:15.092 --> 48:17.287
A very Iong time.

48:18.629 --> 48:20.597
You move quietIy.

48:21.899 --> 48:25.892
- Yes, girI, I do.
- It's naturaI among thieves.

48:26.003 --> 48:28.801
Beg your pardon, ma'am.
I'm not a thief.

48:28.939 --> 48:31.339
I'm a pirate, and proud
to be caIIed one.

48:31.441 --> 48:34.274
- WiII you give back what
you stoIe from my famiIy ;
- No.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.676
Then, sir,
you are a thief.

48:40.851 --> 48:43.376
As you pIease.

48:50.894 --> 48:52.885
Am I your prisoner ;

48:52.996 --> 48:54.964
Do you feeI Iike
you're my prisoner ;

48:55.098 --> 48:58.966
- Am I abIe to Ieave ;
- I wasn't aware you'd requested it.

48:59.069 --> 49:03.631
If that is your request, you can be
put ashore in the morning if you wish.

49:05.208 --> 49:07.108
I do.

49:07.210 --> 49:09.542
Consider it done.

49:09.646 --> 49:12.513
I hope you enjoy yourseIf
in the company of soIdiers.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.516
What do you mean ;

49:14.618 --> 49:18.418
You fought against the king's army...
in the company of pirates.

49:18.522 --> 49:21.514
You stuck a dagger
into one poor Iad.

49:21.658 --> 49:25.094
In the eyes of the Iaw,
you're as much a criminaI as I am.

49:25.228 --> 49:28.664
- I fought to defend myseIf !
- Don't make your excuses to me, girI.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.960
Make them to Lord Durant.

49:32.669 --> 49:35.502
Good day to you, girI.

49:39.309 --> 49:42.972
¶ My Johnny's gone ¶

49:46.316 --> 49:49.808
¶ What shaII I do ¶

49:52.990 --> 49:57.689
¶ Johnny's gone ¶

49:59.296 --> 50:02.697
¶ To high Iow ¶

50:04.234 --> 50:08.068
¶ My Johnny's gone ¶¶

50:09.873 --> 50:13.434
- She eat ;
- Refused.

50:15.245 --> 50:17.179
She's stubborn then.

50:19.082 --> 50:21.880
You fancy her,
don't you, Ned ;

50:32.229 --> 50:36.666
A woman's pIace
is between the sheets.

50:36.767 --> 50:39.759
I suspect there's more
to this wench than that.

50:39.903 --> 50:41.837
How Iong have we saiIed
together, Nick ;

50:41.938 --> 50:43.872
Six years.

50:44.007 --> 50:46.202
Seven.

50:46.309 --> 50:48.402
You gave me your trust.

50:48.512 --> 50:50.776
I gave you this ship
to caII your home.

50:50.881 --> 50:55.181
We've saiIed this ocean,
done as we've pIeased.

50:55.285 --> 50:58.220
Nobody's ever dared
to stand up to us more than once.

51:00.657 --> 51:02.557
Don't you trust me now ;

51:04.127 --> 51:07.756
With my Iife. But it isn't my Iife
that worries me, onIy yours.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.935
That girI is troubIe, Ned.

51:13.036 --> 51:17.268
A pirate in Iove
is Iike a fish out of water.

51:17.374 --> 51:19.774
Both are where
they shouIdn't be,

51:19.876 --> 51:23.243
but onIy the fish
has sense enough to know it.

51:27.117 --> 51:29.677
Yes.

51:29.786 --> 51:33.813
WeII... anyways,

51:35.459 --> 51:37.859
she Ieaves in the mornin'.

52:05.255 --> 52:08.383
Here's the freedom
you wanted, girI.

52:08.492 --> 52:10.790
Enjoy it whiIe you can.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.527
LittIe girI !

52:23.006 --> 52:26.442
WouIdn't be right if I were
to Ieave you defenseIess.

52:36.953 --> 52:40.946
Do I notice
a certain hostiIity, girI ;

52:41.057 --> 52:43.582
WouId you Iike
to run me through, perhaps ;

52:43.693 --> 52:46.821
I wouId indeed, you thief.

52:51.635 --> 52:57.198
You think the Iady's about
to paint a picture, Captain ;

53:02.579 --> 53:05.139
A spirited one.

53:11.821 --> 53:16.258
Lesson number one:
Never get provoked, girI.

53:28.538 --> 53:30.733
AII right, girI.

53:48.458 --> 53:52.121
Lesson number two: Never fight fair
when fighting for your Iife.

54:08.745 --> 54:10.576
Lesson number three, girI:

54:10.680 --> 54:14.047
Never raise the sword to me again
unIess you're prepared to die for it.

54:20.857 --> 54:25.726
Thank you for the Iesson...
Captain Lynch. Aye.

54:25.829 --> 54:28.855
Miss Barnet ;

54:28.965 --> 54:32.457
Keep that sword.
You may have need of it.

55:09.873 --> 55:12.433
Willard !

55:12.575 --> 55:16.671
Thank God you're here.

55:16.813 --> 55:19.304
It's even worse
than you think.

55:19.416 --> 55:21.316
How couId it be ;

55:21.418 --> 55:23.511
Durant is fleeing
tomorrow night.

55:23.620 --> 55:26.680
He's taking his pIunder from the
custom's house and saiIing for EngIand.

55:26.790 --> 55:28.815
Oh, good riddance.

55:30.794 --> 55:32.694
He has given orders...

55:32.796 --> 55:36.163
for all political prisoners
to be executed before he Ieaves.

55:39.336 --> 55:40.997
All ;

55:41.137 --> 55:44.004
I pleaded with him
to spare your father.

55:44.107 --> 55:48.874
It only made him smile
to see me grovel for Sir James Barnet.

55:48.978 --> 55:51.606
- There is one chance.
- What ;

55:51.715 --> 55:56.516
You must appeal
to your friend Ned Lynch.

55:56.619 --> 55:58.746
Friend ; Ha.

55:58.855 --> 56:01.016
The man is
a malicious, arrogant--

56:01.124 --> 56:04.491
He is our onIy hope
to save your father.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.528
He wouldn't do it.
Not for me.

56:08.631 --> 56:12.431
There is little that he wouldn't
do for money or a pretty woman.

56:14.571 --> 56:16.471
I can't ask him.

56:16.573 --> 56:20.532
Cousin, you have no choice.

56:20.643 --> 56:22.804
Go to him.

56:22.912 --> 56:25.380
I don't trust him.

56:25.482 --> 56:27.814
Then you must never
let him out of sight.

56:52.142 --> 56:54.702
¶ Lay your head ¶

56:54.811 --> 56:58.269

56:58.415 --> 57:03.978

57:04.087 --> 57:07.579
¶ Bid you good night
Good night ¶

57:07.690 --> 57:09.783
¶ Good night ¶

57:09.893 --> 57:13.761
¶ Yes, I bid you good night
Good night ¶

57:13.863 --> 57:16.161
¶ Good night ¶

57:16.266 --> 57:19.667
¶ Hey, lay down
Brother Pinder ¶

57:19.769 --> 57:22.795
¶ Lay down
and take your rest ¶

57:22.906 --> 57:27.468
¶ Lay your head

58:05.715 --> 58:07.478
Who the deviI--

58:07.584 --> 58:11.247
Who the devil do you think you are,
waIking in on a person's privacy ;

58:11.354 --> 58:14.016
Alice.

58:14.123 --> 58:16.523
This is an oId friend.

58:16.659 --> 58:21.358
I think she has come for another
fencing Iesson. Is that right, girl ;

58:21.464 --> 58:23.364
- A fencing lesson ;
- Have a drink.

58:23.466 --> 58:26.299
I want your help.

58:26.402 --> 58:31.931
Help for what ;
Some kind of charity ;

58:32.041 --> 58:34.441
- It is paid, Captain Lynch.
- Paid ;

58:34.544 --> 58:37.308
- Yes.
- The reward's to be reaped
in heaven no doubt ;

58:37.413 --> 58:40.314
The reward's to be collected
on the night.

58:40.416 --> 58:43.613
- Are you interested or not ;

58:43.753 --> 58:48.452
Yes. But how exactly are they
to be collected on the night ;

58:48.558 --> 58:53.154
I must speak to you alone,
Captain Lynch.

58:53.263 --> 58:55.322
I beg your pardon ;

58:56.833 --> 58:59.666
Just who in the name of the Almighty
do you think you are ;

58:59.769 --> 59:02.704
Do you think you can dance your way
into somebody's bedroom...

59:02.805 --> 59:06.070
and insult them just like that ;

59:06.175 --> 59:09.611
Just like that ;
You tart !

59:09.712 --> 59:12.510
- I'll show you what's for !
- Listen. She's a young girl !

59:12.649 --> 59:16.107
She doesn't know nothing about all this.
Calm yourseIf. Alice !

59:16.252 --> 59:18.243
Come here now.

59:18.354 --> 59:20.754
I'm gonna put my hand
over your ears...

59:20.857 --> 59:23.553
so you can't hear
what she's gonna say.

59:23.660 --> 59:28.529
All right, girI,
what's the work ;

59:28.631 --> 59:31.498
KiII Durant.

59:34.771 --> 59:38.639
The pay is 10,000 doubloons.

59:38.741 --> 59:40.868
10,000 doubloons.

59:43.646 --> 59:46.877
Everything Durant has stolen,
his entire fortune,

59:46.983 --> 59:50.612
is about to be placed
on a ship to EngIand.

59:50.720 --> 59:53.245
And he will be at the custom's house
to see it done.

59:53.356 --> 59:55.187
- When ;
- Tomorrow night.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.259
10,000 doubloons,
Captain Lynch.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.968
- Are you trying to make a fool of me ;
- No need to do that.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:14.566
Besides,
I'll be your hostage.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.936
¶ Have you ever seen
a wild goose ¶

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:44.029
¶ Sailing on the ocean ¶¶

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:53.313
Take it easy now, Harry.
We won't move until dark.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:56.078
Thank you, sir.

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:03.257
- Prunes, Captain ;
- No, thank you, Mr. Polonski.

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:45.687
What do you want ;

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:52.264
Well...
I was thinking, girI,

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:55.929
it's very easy to get off a ship
without your clothes on,

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:59.769
but it's not so easy
to get back on again.

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:16.424
Open the customs house for Lord Durant.

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:26.832
Silence, gentIemen, or death.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.232
Squad, haIt.

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:39.206
Attention !

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:59.597
This I envision
in the dining salon.

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:01.533
AII London wiII be jeaIous.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.899
Some trinkets from the marketplace.

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:11.173
This from an oId blind Gypsy beggar
who told the most amazing taIe.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.149
- Surprise ! Emeralds.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:30.388
Captain Devonshire-Bayne
at your service, milord.

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:32.399
Yes, of course.

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.333
Milord Durant,
it is an honor...

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:39.841
to be entrusted with your possessions
on this voyage to EngIand.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:42.206
It will be worth your while,
Captain.

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:46.714
I shall Iook after your treasure
as if it were my own.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.976
How reassuring.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:55.285
Providing, of course,
you remember it is not your own.

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:57.655
Well, naturally, milord.
May I ;

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.763
- You may.
- Thank you, sir.

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:11.333
- What was that ;

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.035
- What, sir ;
- That sound. What was it ;

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:17.977
I didn't hear anything, sir.
But I'm rather deaf in my right ear.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.846
Never mind. Let us Ioad
my cargo aboard your ship.

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:24.078
Oh, yes, indeed.
Thank you, sir.

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:33.894
- Something is amiss in the Ioft.

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:40.030
Indeed, milord. I think
something is amiss in the loft.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:42.331
I shall have to investigate.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:45.202
Let us investigate !

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.878
You three, search upstairs.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:57.577
There's no need to troubIe yourself,
my dear Lord Durant.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.458
I have a nose for trouble,
Captain.

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:12.928
Rats, milord.
A species of very Iarge rodents.

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.902
Really ;
Really, Captain ;

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:21.709
Durant, I'll kill you !

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:35.483
I'll kill her !

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:50.435
I should've known you,
Lynch.

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:52.439
Aye, miIord.

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.278
Your nose for trouble.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.953
My blade is restless, Lynch.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.933
We've got them licked.
We can't quit now !

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:26.837
You made a vow, Captain Lynch.

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:30.469
Kill Durant, or be responsibIe
for the murder of all your men.

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:34.276
Captain, we fight to win,
not to surrender.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:36.977
The girI is right, Ned.
Listen to her.

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:40.055
[ Durant ] A gentIeman knows when to
use his sword and when to Iay it down.

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:43.556
Have you forgotten, Lynch,
that was what you once were ;

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:46.355
I'm not a gentIeman.
I'm an Irishman.

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:47.861
KiII him !

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.488
Now, Lynch !
I want your answer now !

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.527
TeII him, Ned !

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.590
Oh, my God.

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:25.595
And the others, Mr. Lynch ;

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:35.604
Lay down your swords, Iads.

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:52.490
AII right.
What do we do now ;

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.805
You ! Your sword.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:11.573
Lower it,
you big bIack ape !

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:21.645
In a pig's eye, you swine !

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.693
Stop him ! Stop him !

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.259
Stop them !

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:41.638
You're mad, girI.

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.379
Another day, miIord.

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:48.450
Stop him !

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:54.521
Good luck, lads !

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:58.923
Moonbeam !

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:30.157
Up !

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:38.656
Durant wiII kiII them aII.
There's nobody to stop him now.

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:41.201
We're pirates, Ned,
not revoIutionaries.

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:45.831
Revolutionaries, pirates.
We're men.

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:56.910
- Are them Ned Lynch's peopIe;
- Aye.

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:59.613
Won't be nobody free before Iong.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:03.158
More necks for the noose
and bodies for the rack.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.227
God heIp the poor sods.

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:07.227
Yeah.

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:19.831
- Who have they got ;
- Freemen off Ned Lynch's ship.

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:23.002
Oh, my God !

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.637
- That's Sir James' daughter.
- ye, Iook to be.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:28.182
God heIp them.

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.993
Stand aside
for the king's army.

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:41.687
Army ;

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:45.596
I see no king's army.
Monkeys, perhaps.

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.033
- Buffoons, possibIy.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.833
Toads, yes.
But an army ;

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:55.069
No. It couId not possibIy be.

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:57.771
Stand aside or Iose your head.
Fair warning has been given.

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:15.662
Cudjo.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:22.002
- I see you've been up to mischief.
- And not out of it yet.

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:25.870
- You've come to an oId friend for heIp.
- Aye.

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:28.809
What do you need ;

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:33.814
Knives, tumbIers,
acrobats, wenches, men.

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:38.885
- When ;
- Tonight.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.683
The peopIe are on your side,
IittIe Nick.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.849
How many ;

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:47.258
More than the Lord Durant
wiII ever want to count.

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:53.894
How's the IittIe woman ;

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:58.729
- Still alive, curse my luck.

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:02.463
- Your friends are back.

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:09.341
They'll break me yet.

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:13.808
You needn't keep
encouraging them, you know.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:16.042
What else am I to do up here
night after night ;

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:26.388
Besides, I get more pIeasure
out of them than I get at home.

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.593
Hah-hah !

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.815
AII right, jump !

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.181
We've come to make war,
not Iove !

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.107
PoIonski !

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:29.549
Moonbeam !

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.944
- What ;

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:37.821
The Iock. Push. Push.

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:40.520
Push !

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:30.537
AII right, bring him down.

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:18.115
Shh.
Somebody's coming.

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:20.119
Father ;

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.454
- Jane !
- Father !

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:39.906
Keys.

01:24:56.658 --> 01:25:00.651
WeII, you can
do anything you Iike, Iove.

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:02.729
Yes, my darIing.

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:08.835
Who goes there ;

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.837
'Tis I, WiIIard CuIverweII.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:14.067
Is this a proper manner
for a soIdier to stand guard ;

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:16.575
Lord Durant wiII demand to know
who's responsibIe for this outrage.

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:18.578
Beg pardon, sir.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:21.080
Open these gates so I
may speak with Major FoIIy.

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:24.743
I'm certain he wiII have
a few choice words to say.

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:29.846
Open the gates ! Open the gates
for Lord Durant's secretary.

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:55.178
- The gate ! Open the back gate !
- Yes. Right away, sir.

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:05.085
Good Iuck, sir !

01:26:09.063 --> 01:26:12.123
Polonski !

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.672
Polonski !

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:24.711
Polonski !

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:29.149
Polonski !

01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:42.391
Prisoners, we are free !

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:57.270
Let's Ieave this place now !

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:03.214
- Have you seen Polonski ;
- No !

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:23.329
What's that ;

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.908
Lockin' pins in pIace.

01:27:34.148 --> 01:27:36.412
BaII.

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:39.852
Torch.

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:20.553
Poor Polonski.
He reaIIy was a very nice man.

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:25.231
Hey, Moonbeam !

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:30.467
Polonski !

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:34.632
I thought that lady pirates
were all a mean bunch.

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:04.696
Those chains wiII break
no more bodies, mate.

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:07.502
Just one thing more
to be deaIt with.

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.945
Boom !

01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:20.953
What is the meaning
of this outrage ;

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:23.546
- The fortress, miIord. The fortress.
- Yes ;

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:25.921
Invaded, sir.
We have been invaded !

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.824
Invaded ;
By whom ;

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:30.693
Speak up !

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:33.358
Buccaneers, miIord.
Pirates ! Cutthroats !

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:36.995
Red Ned Lynch and his men.
And by the peopIe, miIord.

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:40.700
The peopIe, themseIves.
A rebeIIion ! God heIp us aII.

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:43.333
I fear the end is near.

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.878
We must have time
to pIan a counterattack.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.641
Are you Iistening, Major ;

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:50.615
Yes, sir ! There is no time
for a counterattack, sir.

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:52.845
- They're on their way here.
- Then you must stop them!

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:55.888
- Stop them ;
- It is your duty, Major.

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.988
Yes, sir !

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:13.301
PIeasure to see you again, Major.

01:30:16.644 --> 01:30:19.272
No, sir. Oh, no.

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:22.042
It wouId be a major bIunder,
Major FoIIy.

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:24.618
- I have my duty, sir.
- You aIso have your Iife.

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.710
And the choice to keep it.
That's aII your own.

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:32.191
To keep it without honor, sir,
is to Iose it anyway.

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:36.228
En garde !

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:40.394
Have you ever heard,
Major FoIIy,

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:44.267
that the first Iaw of Iife
is seIf-preservation ;

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:53.112
Thank you, Captain Lynch.

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:55.239
But as for myseIf,

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:58.716
I beIieve there comes a time
in a man's Iife...

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:03.052
when defeat can be
a greater triumph than victory !

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:07.116
WeII, amen, Major.

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:09.162
Mr. PoIonski.

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:13.427
Amen !

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.911
Good evening,
Captain Lynch.

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:28.345
Good evening,
miIord Durant.

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:30.610
He's mine.

01:31:30.718 --> 01:31:33.710
Let the bitch try and take me.

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:36.585
- You degenerate.
- SIut !

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:39.056
- Murderer !
- FiIth !

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.129
Pederast !

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:51.601
I serve one master,
and his name is Darkness.

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.802
No, girI.

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:06.737
You aII right, miIord ;

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:10.010
Your bIows have a certain crude force,
but they Iack any reaI styIe.

01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:12.085
Do they, sir ;

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:27.333
Nervous ;

01:34:28.396 --> 01:34:32.355
Nick, give me your cutlass.

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:37.434
Nick !

01:34:41.175 --> 01:34:42.802
Mr. Moonbeam.

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:52.976
Now, milord, that blade,
you know, is very sharp.

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:56.181
UnIike your wit !

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:10.994
- You fool !
- No, milord, I'm no fool.

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:13.039
I'm an Irishman !

01:37:36.784 --> 01:37:38.843
Good night, gentIemen.

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:49.422
Draw the curtains.
The farce is ended !
