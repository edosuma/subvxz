05:18.612 --> 05:20.511

05:20.513 --> 05:23.647
<i>But later, she took it all back</i>

06:57.278 --> 06:59.646

<i>vulnerable as I did the

07:14.128 --> 07:18.664

<i>a bunch of robes coming from the bench.</i>

07:49.031 --> 07:50.931
<i>We like that you've been able to</i>

<i>play nice on both sides of the</i>

<i>aisle and your career is defined</i>

<i>by righting injustice rather
than party politics.</i>

08:00.443 --> 08:01.542
<i>KASTLE: You're a crusader,</i>

<i>Patty, and in this Main Street</i>

<i>like to put your name on it, but</i>

08:15.123 --> 08:17.357
<i>we have been burned before.</i>

08:17.359 --> 08:19.359
<i>You know what gets exposed when</i>

08:24.165 --> 08:26.132

08:26.134 --> 08:28.568
<i>(Parsons shrieks, Hewes sobs)</i>

08:28.570 --> 08:32.672

08:35.544 --> 08:40.480
<i>HEWES: I told Pete

<i>KASTLE: You have to understand, uh...
Ms. Hewes</i>

08:50.526 --> 08:54.728
<i>built an incredibly successful
firm from the ground up.</i>

08:54.730 --> 08:57.097
<i>She has tremendous influence and</i>

08:57.099 --> 09:01.835
<i>the freedom to try only those
cases that interest her most.</i>

09:01.837 --> 09:07.341
<i>Well, that would be very hard to give up.</i>

09:07.343 --> 09:10.878
<i>PARSONS: You confessed
to me, Patty.</i>

09:10.880 --> 09:13.848

<i>make himself look better?</i>

10:54.749 --> 10:57.449
<i>McCLAREN: What is it?</i>

10:57.451 --> 11:00.652
<i>SIMON: I lied about Torben.</i>

11:00.654 --> 11:02.821
<i>I do know who he is.</i>

11:05.325 --> 11:06.491
<i>McCLAREN: Who is he?</i>

11:06.493 --> 11:08.894
<i>SIMON: He is one of
our supporters.</i>

11:08.896 --> 11:12.230
<i>And a very important financial</i>

11:12.232 --> 11:14.432

11:14.434 --> 11:15.800
<i>McCLAREN: Jesus Christ.</i>

11:15.802 --> 11:17.836
<i>SIMON: Listen, just hear me out.</i>

11:17.838 --> 11:21.640
<i>Right before the Naomi Walling
leak, we needed funds.</i>

11:21.642 --> 11:24.776
<i>Torben was very enthusiastic
about the cause, and could</i>

11:24.778 --> 11:30.748
<i>provide a very healthy influx of cash.</i>

11:30.750 --> 11:34.552
<i>I... I didn't know he was
wrapped up in Princefield.</i>

11:34.554 --> 11:36.787
<i>McCLAREN: No?</i>

11:36.789 --> 11:39.023
<i>Why'd you lie to me about him?</i>

11:41.393 --> 11:44.695
<i>SIMON: I don't know.</i>

11:44.697 --> 11:46.898
<i>Just... knee-jerk.</i>

11:46.900 --> 11:49.934
<i>I fucked up.</i>

11:49.936 --> 11:52.670
<i>I felt like I'd failed you.</i>

11:57.443 --> 11:59.577
<i>McCLAREN: Why would someone
who provided Princefield</i>

11:59.579 --> 12:02.246
<i>with insider tips also want to fund us?</i>

12:02.248 --> 12:04.182
<i>SIMON: I don't know.</i>

12:04.184 --> 12:07.686
<i>But I can imagine what'll
happen to this Web site if</i>

12:07.688 --> 12:09.254
<i>anyone else finds out about this.</i>

12:09.256 --> 12:11.590
<i>McCLAREN: Torben's a criminal,
and we need to out him.</i>

12:11.592 --> 12:14.126
<i>SIMON: Channing, we are already
embroiled in one scandal.</i>

12:14.128 --> 12:15.761
<i>We can't afford to have another.</i>

12:15.763 --> 12:20.399
<i>Once this case is over, then
we'll go after Torben.</i>

12:20.401 --> 12:21.868
<i>In the meantime, we can't tell</i>

12:32.179 --> 12:34.381
<i>McCLAREN: All right.</i>

<i>HERNDON: My point is that the</i>

<i>every goddamn trick in the book

<i>HERNDON: And they found nothing.</i>

13:14.722 --> 13:16.054
<i>And we haven't done any better.</i>

<i>And these lemmings have gone</i>

13:17.224 --> 13:19.024
<i>through every goddamn case we can find.</i>

13:19.026 --> 13:20.759
<i>McClaren's got his major donors</i>

13:34.108 --> 13:36.708
<i>HERNDON: Well, what has Parsons
turned over in discovery?</i>

13:36.710 --> 13:39.478
<i>HEWES: According to the
financial statements that she</i>

13:39.480 --> 13:43.715
<i>submitted, McClaren is virtually broke.</i>

13:43.717 --> 13:46.185
<i>HERNDON: Maybe he is.</i>

13:46.187 --> 13:47.953
<i>HEWES: Bullshit.</i>

13:47.955 --> 13:51.257
<i>Find out who's funding him
and what he's worth.</i>

13:51.259 --> 13:54.261
<i>HERNDON: All right,
everybody, out.</i>

14:02.204 --> 14:04.105
<i>All right, that's it.</i>

14:04.107 --> 14:05.873
<i>I mean, somebody's got to say it.</i>

14:05.875 --> 14:07.208
<i>You can ask for all the damages</i>

14:07.210 --> 14:08.977
<i>you want, but you ain't got a fucking case.</i>

14:08.979 --> 14:10.412
<i>HEWES: I've won with less.</i>

14:10.414 --> 14:11.847
<i>HERNDON: Yeah, maybe.</i>

14:11.849 --> 14:14.616
<i>But not without the benefit
of a guilty target.</i>

14:14.618 --> 14:15.717
<i>HEWES: What does that mean?</i>

14:15.719 --> 14:19.888
<i>HERNDON: It means I don't
believe McClaren is guilty.</i>

14:19.890 --> 14:22.624
<i>All right, maybe he's an
egomaniac, and maybe he got a</i>

14:22.626 --> 14:24.826
<i>little rough with Naomi
Walling in that hotel room.</i>

14:24.828 --> 14:28.830
<i>But I don't really believe
that he tried to harm her.</i>

14:28.832 --> 14:31.532
<i>And you got nothing to show that I'm wrong.</i>

14:31.534 --> 14:33.534
<i>HEWES: Well, I appreciate
your opinion.</i>

14:33.536 --> 14:34.468
<i>(Herndon scoffs)</i>

14:34.470 --> 14:35.569
<i>HERNDON: You know, it's not</i>

14:35.571 --> 14:36.837
<i>enough that you're wasting your</i>

14:36.839 --> 14:40.107
<i>time, you're risking 30-plus
years of your reputation.</i>

14:40.109 --> 14:41.341
<i>You think you can beat Ellen</i>

14:41.343 --> 14:44.344
<i>Parsons with nothing, but
what if you lose, Patty?</i>

14:44.346 --> 14:47.546
<i>What if you lose?</i>

14:47.548 --> 14:49.515
<i>HEWES: Get back to work.</i>

14:49.517 --> 14:53.085
<i>Find out who's funding Channing McClaren.</i>

15:05.833 --> 15:09.270
<i>SIMON: Channing wants to tell
Ellen Parsons about you.</i>

15:09.272 --> 15:11.805
<i>TORBEN: That cannot happen.</i>

15:11.807 --> 15:13.340
<i>SIMON: It won't.</i>

15:13.342 --> 15:15.042
<i>I've convinced him not to.</i>

15:15.044 --> 15:15.943
<i>TORBEN: Very good.</i>

15:15.945 --> 15:17.043
<i>SIMON: No, not very good.</i>

15:17.045 --> 15:18.979
<i>Not very good, at all.</i>

15:18.981 --> 15:20.447
<i>You've compromised me.</i>

15:20.449 --> 15:21.781
<i>You know damn well I would never</i>

15:21.783 --> 15:23.484
<i>have made this arrangement if</i>

15:23.486 --> 15:25.453
<i>I'd known you were involved in that crime.</i>

15:25.455 --> 15:27.288
<i>TORBEN: Calm yourself,
Mr. Simon.</i>

15:27.290 --> 15:28.422
<i>SIMON: You better not have</i>

15:28.424 --> 15:30.224
<i>any more fucking surprises for me.</i>

15:30.226 --> 15:31.992
<i>TORBEN: Don't worry about it.</i>

15:31.994 --> 15:34.762
<i>There's nothing else.</i>

15:34.764 --> 15:37.698
<i>We are still partners, yes?</i>

15:37.700 --> 15:44.671
<i>Soon, it will be over, you'll get
everything that was promised to you.</i>

15:44.673 --> 15:47.674
<i>SIMON: Tell Mr. Herreshoff
I'm not pleased.</i>

15:47.676 --> 15:50.244
<i>TORBEN: I'll tell him,
but he will not care.</i>

15:50.246 --> 15:52.079
<i>SIMON: Well, he should care.</i>

15:52.081 --> 15:56.517
<i>I can still pull the plug on this
whole thing whenever I want.</i>

15:59.087 --> 16:06.087
<i>TORBEN: For someone in your position,
making threats is very foolish.</i>

16:08.896 --> 16:10.930
<i>(engine starts)</i>

16:19.807 --> 16:21.841
<i>(sighs)</i>

16:24.077 --> 16:25.544
<i>PARSONS: You confessed to me.</i>

16:25.546 --> 16:27.512
<i>HEWES: I told you what
you wanted to hear.</i>

16:27.514 --> 16:29.314
<i>PARSONS: If not you, then who?</i>

16:29.316 --> 16:30.215
<i>HEWES: Pete.</i>

16:30.217 --> 16:33.918
<i>He may have acted on his own
in order to protect me.</i>

16:49.969 --> 16:51.236
<i>PARSONS: Mrs. McKee.</i>

16:51.238 --> 16:52.571
<i>I'm surprised to hear from you.</i>

16:52.573 --> 16:56.074
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

16:56.076 --> 16:58.911
<i>STEFANIA: I found something
in Peter's closet.</i>

16:58.913 --> 17:00.980
<i>It has your name.</i>

17:05.752 --> 17:08.686
<i>PARSONS: Did he ever
explain these to you?</i>

17:08.689 --> 17:10.756
<i>STEFANIA: No.</i>

17:14.426 --> 17:19.030
<i>If Pete did anything bad, it was for Patty.</i>

17:19.031 --> 17:21.098
<i>(dog barking)</i>

17:26.739 --> 17:32.709
<i>Because everything he did...
was for Patty.</i>

17:32.711 --> 17:33.644
<i>(dog barking)</i>

17:33.646 --> 17:36.413
<i>(Parsons screaming)</i>

17:42.786 --> 17:44.186
<i>FRANKLIN: You okay?</i>

17:44.188 --> 17:45.554
<i>PARSONS: Just need some air.</i>

17:45.556 --> 17:46.589
<i>FRANKLIN: Oh, Patty wants</i>

17:46.591 --> 17:48.757
<i>another list of McClaren donors.</i>

18:01.737 --> 18:03.771
<i>(panting)</i>

18:14.484 --> 18:16.518
<i>(bird cooing, wings fluttering)</i>

18:31.835 --> 18:33.870
<i>PARSONS: Hello?</i>

18:37.575 --> 18:38.808
<i>(knocking)</i>

18:38.810 --> 18:42.679
<i>Hello, Mrs. McKee?</i>

18:42.681 --> 18:44.748
<i>It's Ellen Parsons.</i>

18:46.985 --> 18:49.120
<i>(knocking)</i>

18:49.122 --> 18:50.221
<i>STEFANIA: Hold your horses.</i>

18:50.223 --> 18:53.590
<i>I don't move so good.</i>

18:53.592 --> 18:54.925
<i>Yeah?</i>

18:54.927 --> 18:55.792
<i>(grunts)</i>

18:55.794 --> 18:57.494
<i>PARSONS: - Hi.
STEFANIA: - Uh-huh?</i>

18:57.496 --> 18:58.695
<i>PARSONS: It's Ellen Parsons.</i>

18:58.697 --> 19:01.097
<i>I brought some pastries.</i>

19:01.099 --> 19:01.998
<i>STEFANIA: Oh.</i>

19:02.000 --> 19:04.167
<i>Yeah, that... thank you,
that... Come in.</i>

19:04.169 --> 19:05.034
<i>PARSONS: Thank you.</i>

19:05.036 --> 19:05.902
<i>STEFANIA: Careful.</i>

19:05.904 --> 19:06.769
<i>PARSONS: Thank you.</i>

19:06.771 --> 19:08.770
<i>STEFANIA: Don't trip.</i>

19:08.772 --> 19:09.938
<i>(TV playing in background)</i>

19:09.940 --> 19:16.940
<i>So... how are things at
Hewes & Associates?</i>

19:17.081 --> 19:18.548
<i>Patty is well?</i>

19:18.550 --> 19:20.650
<i>PARSONS: Actually, a little</i>

19:20.652 --> 19:22.584
<i>after Uncle Pete passed away,</i>

19:22.586 --> 19:25.888
<i>Patty and I kind of went our separate ways.</i>

19:25.890 --> 19:26.889
<i>(Stefania chuckles)</i>

19:26.891 --> 19:29.258
<i>STEFANIA: Ah, yes.</i>

19:29.260 --> 19:31.494
<i>Patty is very demanding boss.</i>

19:31.496 --> 19:32.628
<i>PARSONS: Yes.</i>

19:32.630 --> 19:36.465
<i>She was.</i>

19:36.467 --> 19:42.572
<i>Last time I saw you, Mrs.
McKee, you gave me this.</i>

19:42.574 --> 19:44.241
<i>At the time, you said something</i>

19:44.243 --> 19:47.477
<i>and, um, I've been wondering about it.</i>

19:47.479 --> 19:49.478
<i>STEFANIA: What did I say?</i>

19:49.480 --> 19:54.183
<i>PARSONS: You said, "Everything
that Pete does is for Patty."</i>

19:54.185 --> 19:55.318
<i>STEFANIA: I say this?</i>

19:55.320 --> 19:57.119
<i>PARSONS: Yeah.</i>

19:57.121 --> 19:58.855
<i>Do you remember why?</i>

19:58.857 --> 19:59.856
<i>STEFANIA: No, I'm sorry.</i>

19:59.858 --> 20:02.492
<i>I... I don't.</i>

20:02.494 --> 20:06.797
<i>But Peter was always very loyal to Patty.</i>

20:06.799 --> 20:08.265
<i>He loved her like a daughter.</i>

20:08.267 --> 20:11.636
<i>Would do anything she asked.</i>

20:11.638 --> 20:17.242
<i>Patty gave him job, believed in him.</i>

20:17.244 --> 20:22.581
<i>Peter became a different
man because of Patty.</i>

20:22.583 --> 20:24.884
<i>PARSONS: I know they
were very close.</i>

20:24.886 --> 20:30.156
<i>STEFANIA: Yeah, but they
did used to argue.</i>

20:30.158 --> 20:31.290
<i>PARSONS: I didn't know that.</i>

20:31.292 --> 20:32.492
<i>(Stefania chuckles)</i>

20:32.494 --> 20:36.028
<i>STEFANIA: Yes, big fights.</i>

20:36.030 --> 20:36.929
<i>PARSONS: About what?</i>

20:36.931 --> 20:39.565
<i>STEFANIA: Many things.</i>

20:39.567 --> 20:41.867
<i>But also you.</i>

20:41.869 --> 20:44.837
<i>Peter thought Patty was crazy to hire you.</i>

20:44.839 --> 20:48.775
<i>She trusted you too much.</i>

20:48.777 --> 20:49.609
<i>PARSONS: Really?</i>

20:49.611 --> 20:55.315
<i>STEFANIA: Mm. Peter saw Patty
rely on you more and more.</i>

20:55.317 --> 21:01.554
<i>It was almost like he was, um...
jealous.</i>

21:04.358 --> 21:07.294
<i>PARSONS: Can I ask you
one more question?</i>

21:07.296 --> 21:10.997
<i>STEFANIA: Uh-huh.</i>

21:10.999 --> 21:13.700
<i>PARSONS: Who is this?</i>

21:13.702 --> 21:17.204
<i>STEFANIA: Peter had
many friends.</i>

21:17.206 --> 21:19.740
<i>Uh... no.</i>

21:19.742 --> 21:20.708
<i>I don't know him.</i>

21:20.710 --> 21:23.944
<i>I never saw him before.</i>

21:23.946 --> 21:25.346
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21:25.348 --> 21:27.415
<i>I wish I could help.</i>

21:27.417 --> 21:29.117
<i>PARSONS: You already have.</i>

21:29.119 --> 21:31.586
<i>Thank you, Mrs. McKee.</i>

21:31.588 --> 21:37.092
<i>And, uh, if you think of anything
else, please give me a call.</i>

21:41.999 --> 21:43.366
<i>FRANKLIN: Hi.</i>

21:43.368 --> 21:45.202
<i>MICHAEL: I'm looking
for Ms. Franklin.</i>

21:45.204 --> 21:47.037
<i>FRANKLIN: Kate, yes.</i>

21:47.039 --> 21:48.539
<i>Thank you for coming in.
Please.</i>

21:48.541 --> 21:50.641
<i>MICHAEL: Sure.</i>

21:50.643 --> 21:52.342
<i>FRANKLIN: Have a seat.</i>

21:52.344 --> 21:54.477
<i>Can I get you something to drink?</i>

21:54.479 --> 21:57.113
<i>MICHAEL: No, I'm good.</i>

21:57.115 --> 21:58.447
<i>So you work for Ellen?</i>

21:58.449 --> 22:00.116
<i>FRANKLIN: I do.</i>

22:00.118 --> 22:03.252
<i>MICHAEL: But on the phone, you said
this isn't about my custody case.</i>

22:03.254 --> 22:06.855
<i>FRANKLIN: No, I wanted to
discuss an unrelated matter.</i>

22:06.857 --> 22:09.457
<i>A client I represent has
a proposition for you.</i>

22:09.459 --> 22:12.327
<i>MICHAEL: Who's your client?</i>

22:12.329 --> 22:14.029
<i>FRANKLIN: Lyle Hewes.</i>

22:14.031 --> 22:16.031
<i>MICHAEL: My grandfather?</i>

22:16.033 --> 22:17.332
<i>FRANKLIN: That's right.</i>

22:17.334 --> 22:21.269
<i>MICHAEL: But isn't the guy dead?</i>

22:21.271 --> 22:22.504
<i>FRANKLIN: No.</i>

22:22.506 --> 22:26.007
<i>Although his health is failing,
Mr. Hewes is very much alive.</i>

22:26.009 --> 22:29.712
<i>MICHAEL: My mother told me
he died when I was a kid.</i>

22:29.714 --> 22:34.016
<i>FRANKLIN: I'm afraid your mother
wasn't telling you the truth.</i>

22:34.018 --> 22:36.852
<i>Mr. Hewes has asked me to
arrange a meeting with you.</i>

22:36.854 --> 22:38.521
<i>MICHAEL: Why?</i>

22:38.523 --> 22:43.960
<i>FRANKLIN: He'd like to
include you in his will.</i>

22:43.962 --> 22:45.294
<i>MICHAEL: Are you serious?</i>

22:45.296 --> 22:46.962
<i>FRANKLIN: I am.</i>

22:46.964 --> 22:51.134
<i>So, if you have an open day
this week, Mr. Hewes was</i>

22:51.136 --> 22:54.137
<i>hoping to explain it all to you himself.</i>

22:59.344 --> 23:01.512
<i>PARSONS: So, Davies said
Torben was responsible for</i>

23:01.514 --> 23:02.746
<i>passing on the illegal tips?</i>

23:02.748 --> 23:06.484
<i>McCLAREN: He also seemed to think
Torben may have killed Samurai Seven.</i>

23:06.486 --> 23:10.455
<i>PARSONS: I have to go to
the police with this.</i>

23:10.457 --> 23:12.157
<i>McCLAREN: You can't.</i>

23:12.159 --> 23:13.291
<i>PARSONS: Why not?</i>

23:13.293 --> 23:16.928
<i>McCLAREN: Because we're
in bed with Torben.</i>

23:16.930 --> 23:19.397
<i>He is McClarenTruth's biggest donor.</i>

23:19.399 --> 23:22.033
<i>He funded the Princefield leaks.</i>

23:22.035 --> 23:24.436
<i>PARSONS: How was Torben
brought in as a donor?</i>

23:24.438 --> 23:25.537
<i>McCLAREN: Rutger found him.</i>

23:25.539 --> 23:27.940
<i>PARSONS: If Rutger didn't
want you to tell me,</i>

23:27.942 --> 23:29.074
<i>then why are you here?</i>

23:29.076 --> 23:31.543
<i>McCLAREN: If Helmut Torben was
involved in the insider</i>

23:31.545 --> 23:34.812
<i>trading, then he had direct motive
to discredit Naomi Walling.</i>

23:34.814 --> 23:37.414
<i>NOVAK: Torben could have leaked
her personal information,</i>

23:37.416 --> 23:40.717
<i>which would exonerate Channing.</i>

23:40.719 --> 23:43.453
<i>PARSONS: Only if we have proof.</i>

23:43.455 --> 23:47.557
<i>NOVAK: That's why we
have to pursue Torben.</i>

23:49.393 --> 23:50.993
<i>PARSONS: It's dangerous.</i>

23:50.995 --> 23:53.028
<i>Torben is very wealthy and powerful.</i>

23:53.030 --> 23:55.564
<i>We have to be careful of men like that.</i>

23:55.566 --> 23:57.666
<i>McCLAREN: What are you saying?</i>

23:57.668 --> 23:58.934
<i>PARSONS: If what Davies says</i>

23:58.936 --> 24:01.503
<i>is true, then Torben has a lot to lose.</i>

24:01.505 --> 24:03.437
<i>But he has no reason to stir up</i>

24:03.439 --> 24:05.840
<i>trouble in our case unless
I start to target him.</i>

24:05.842 --> 24:07.274
<i>Then he could turn on us.</i>

24:07.276 --> 24:09.543
<i>NOVAK: So let me get
this straight.</i>

24:09.545 --> 24:11.011
<i>There's a man out there who has</i>

24:11.013 --> 24:12.379
<i>a reason to want to discredit</i>

24:12.381 --> 24:13.581
<i>Naomi Walling, everything that</i>

24:13.583 --> 24:14.916
<i>Channing is being accused of,</i>

24:14.918 --> 24:16.517
<i>and you want to leave him alone?</i>

24:16.519 --> 24:19.287
<i>McCLAREN: - Gitta...
NOVAK: - I'm sorry, but I don't understand.</i>

24:19.289 --> 24:21.288
<i>PARSONS: Right now,
Patty's case is weak.</i>

24:21.290 --> 24:23.123
<i>The trial is just around the corner.</i>

24:23.125 --> 24:26.761
<i>We can pursue Torben if
and when we need to.</i>

24:26.763 --> 24:30.465
<i>But to go after him unnecessarily,
it's, it's stupid.</i>

24:30.467 --> 24:32.634
<i>NOVAK: Look who's
representing you.</i>

24:32.636 --> 24:34.602
<i>Can you believe this cynical shit?</i>

24:34.604 --> 24:36.537
<i>PARSONS: I'm trying
to win your case.</i>

24:36.539 --> 24:37.905
<i>NOVAK: Torben is a criminal.</i>

24:37.907 --> 24:40.208
<i>PARSONS: Who donated
to your cause.</i>

24:40.210 --> 24:42.210
<i>NOVAK: So?</i>

24:42.212 --> 24:47.815
<i>PARSONS: I just don't want to see this
whole thing blow up in your face.</i>

24:47.817 --> 24:49.884
<i>McCLAREN: She has a point.</i>

24:52.687 --> 24:56.457
<i>PARSONS: Right now, Chris Sanchez is going
to be sending you his information.</i>

24:56.459 --> 25:01.695
<i>Focus on that, and let's just
keep this to ourselves.</i>

25:06.500 --> 25:09.602
<i>SANCHEZ: The guys I've seen
on the tapes, they have all</i>

25:09.604 --> 25:11.737
<i>the symptoms of
full-blown PTSD, okay?</i>

25:11.739 --> 25:15.108
<i>They can't sleep, they're-
they're shaky, disoriented.</i>

25:15.110 --> 25:17.510
<i>These guys are ready to
fall apart any second.</i>

25:17.512 --> 25:19.513
<i>SIMON: But they got
redeployed anyway?</i>

25:19.515 --> 25:21.014
<i>SANCHEZ: Within weeks.</i>

25:21.016 --> 25:22.649
<i>And then the shit hit the fan...</i>

25:22.651 --> 25:28.555
<i>Suicides, friendly fire,
abuse of non-combatants.</i>

25:28.557 --> 25:31.858
<i>They're fed a boatload of antidepressants,
and then they're sent back in.</i>

25:31.860 --> 25:32.792
<i>And the military?</i>

25:32.794 --> 25:34.327
<i>They just buried all of it.</i>

25:34.329 --> 25:38.064
<i>SIMON: This is very
intriguing, but we are</i>

25:38.066 --> 25:39.799
<i>gonna need something more concrete.</i>

25:39.801 --> 25:41.434
<i>SANCHEZ: I can get
you interviews.</i>

25:41.436 --> 25:44.771
<i>I can get you medical records,
deployment documentation.</i>

25:44.773 --> 25:46.473
<i>I can get you whatever you need.</i>

25:46.475 --> 25:48.408
<i>SIMON: Well, if you do,
then McClarenTruth would</i>

25:48.410 --> 25:50.844
<i>love to help you present this to the world.</i>

25:50.846 --> 25:55.249
<i>SANCHEZ: So, what's
the next step?</i>

25:55.251 --> 25:57.785
<i>SIMON: Okay, these are the
encryption codes you'll need</i>

25:57.787 --> 25:59.153
<i>to upload all the information</i>

25:59.155 --> 26:01.155
<i>you can get onto our servers.</i>

26:01.157 --> 26:02.857
<i>SANCHEZ: And then,
then what happens?</i>

26:02.859 --> 26:04.258
<i>You guys do what?</i>

26:04.260 --> 26:11.260
<i>SIMON: Well, we sort through
everything, clean it up, and post it.</i>

26:11.768 --> 26:13.867
<i>Look, I understand your reluctance, Chris.</i>

26:13.869 --> 26:16.537
<i>I can assure you what happened</i>

26:16.539 --> 26:21.842
<i>with Naomi Walling, that is
never gonna happen again.</i>

26:52.338 --> 26:56.141
<i>PARSONS: You don't have to go
through with this, you know.</i>

26:56.143 --> 27:00.179
<i>SANCHEZ: Are you sure
you're okay with it?</i>

27:00.181 --> 27:06.185
<i>Look, I don't want to fuck
up your case or anything.</i>

27:06.187 --> 27:09.088
<i>PARSONS: Actually, I-I think
it could do the opposite.</i>

27:09.090 --> 27:14.092
<i>It could finally focus some
positive press on McClaren.</i>

27:14.094 --> 27:16.161
<i>But I...</i>

27:18.331 --> 27:20.632
<i>SANCHEZ: But what?</i>

27:20.634 --> 27:24.802
<i>PARSONS: The information you're
giving them is classified.</i>

27:24.804 --> 27:28.839
<i>You broke the law to get it.</i>

27:35.347 --> 27:39.851
<i>SANCHEZ: Those
soldiers need this.</i>

27:39.853 --> 27:43.689
<i>Somebody's got to get their story out.</i>

27:43.691 --> 27:47.727

to think about it.</i>

known about me?</i>

<i>after you said that you were</i>

doubt your account.</i>

better, Michael.</i>

38:26.406 --> 38:28.773
<i>My father is using you.</i>

38:28.775 --> 38:32.577
<i>He only reached out to you
in order to get to me.</i>

him too much credit.</i>

38:36.283 --> 38:38.250
<i>He's a crazy old man.</i>

<i>Couldn't have been that bad.</i>

<i>ELLSWORTHY: No, sir.</i>

40:11.447 --> 40:14.715
<i>No, sir, I guess I do not
feel ready for combat, sir.</i>

40:14.717 --> 40:16.317
<i>Duly noted, Corporal.</i>

40:16.319 --> 40:17.885
<i>I'm going to have the nurses</i>

40:17.887 --> 40:19.587
<i>over there start you on a course</i>

40:19.589 --> 40:22.323
<i>of medications today that
will get you feeling better.</i>

40:22.325 --> 40:23.624
<i>And then you'll be good to go.</i>

40:23.626 --> 40:25.326
<i>ELLSWORTHY: No, I'm
not good to go, sir.</i>

40:25.328 --> 40:26.328
<i>Take the pills.</i>

40:26.330 --> 40:27.329
<i>You'll see.</i>

40:27.331 --> 40:28.563
<i>They'll change your outlook.</i>

40:28.565 --> 40:31.299
<i>ELLSWORTHY: You
don't understand.</i>

40:31.301 --> 40:33.101
<i>Please, I can't go back.</i>

40:33.103 --> 40:36.237
<i>I'm not good for my guys like this.</i>

40:36.239 --> 40:38.505
<i>Soldier, take the meds.</i>

40:38.507 --> 40:40.774
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

40:40.776 --> 40:43.076
<i>Am I clear?</i>

40:43.078 --> 40:44.411
<i>ELLSWORTHY: Yes, sir.</i>

40:44.413 --> 40:45.412
<i>Good.</i>

40:45.414 --> 40:47.414
<i>I'll check on your progress in a few weeks.</i>

40:47.416 --> 40:49.549
<i>ELLSWORTHY: Look, sir, if...
if I could just talk...</i>

40:49.551 --> 40:51.417
<i>I have to talk to another patient now.</i>

40:51.419 --> 40:54.187
<i>Good day, soldier.</i>

41:04.199 --> 41:05.665
<i>However long it takes.</i>

41:05.667 --> 41:07.234
<i>You'll work in pairs.</i>

<i>No one in or out until we're done.</i>

41:10.506 --> 41:12.573

41:12.575 --> 41:15.342
<i>No Wi-Fi, no Internet, nothing.</i>

41:15.344 --> 41:18.512
<i>You'll hand in your phones,
your tablets, and when we're</i>

41:18.514 --> 41:21.516
<i>finished, I'll search you again.</i>

41:21.518 --> 41:23.618
<i>No data leaves.</i>

41:23.620 --> 41:28.324
<i>And absolutely nothing is
posted unless I do it myself.</i>

<i>If anyone has a problem with any</i>

42:28.219 --> 42:29.485
<i>I ordered already.</i>

42:29.487 --> 42:30.519
<i>I was starving.</i>

42:30.521 --> 42:31.620
<i>I'm afraid I couldn't wait.</i>

42:31.622 --> 42:34.222
<i>HEWES: How dare you
go behind my back.</i>

42:34.224 --> 42:35.757
<i>Michael is my son.</i>

42:35.759 --> 42:38.360
<i>If I wanted him to meet his
grandfather and see where I</i>

42:38.362 --> 42:40.529
<i>grew up, I would have taken him myself.</i>

42:40.531 --> 42:41.997
<i>FRANKLIN: Lyle is my client.</i>

42:41.999 --> 42:44.767
<i>I was acting as his lawyer
and serving his wishes.</i>

42:44.769 --> 42:47.236
<i>HEWES: Lyle, your client,
whatever the fuck you want to</i>

42:47.238 --> 42:49.872
<i>call him, was an evil prick.</i>

42:49.874 --> 42:53.341
<i>FRANKLIN: He is dying, Patty, and
he is trying to make amends.</i>

42:53.343 --> 42:58.313
<i>HEWES: There is no possible
way for him to make amends.</i>

42:58.315 --> 42:59.614
<i>FRANKLIN: I'm sorry that he</i>

42:59.616 --> 43:01.349
<i>abandoned you and your mother.</i>

43:01.351 --> 43:03.985
<i>That must have been horrible.</i>

43:05.755 --> 43:08.590
<i>Patty, you have already made your point.</i>

43:08.592 --> 43:09.758
<i>You sued him.</i>

43:09.760 --> 43:11.560
<i>You beat me in court.</i>

43:11.562 --> 43:12.761
<i>You wiped him out.</i>

43:12.763 --> 43:14.229
<i>You took everything he had.</i>

43:14.231 --> 43:16.998
<i>So why are you still clinging
to all of this hatred?</i>

43:17.000 --> 43:18.800
<i>What is the point?</i>

43:18.802 --> 43:21.202
<i>HEWES: There is no point.</i>

43:21.204 --> 43:25.173
<i>Hating him is enough.</i>

43:25.175 --> 43:28.810
<i>Stay away from my son.</i>

43:38.288 --> 43:40.322
<i>(sighs)</i>

43:50.169 --> 43:51.335
<i>You've scoured everything.</i>

43:51.337 --> 43:53.804

43:55.740 --> 43:58.776

44:28.742 --> 44:30.074
<i>HERNDON: Yeah, a big one.</i>

44:30.076 --> 44:32.343
<i>He's got the military by the
balls, and now he's getting</i>

44:32.345 --> 44:36.080
<i>more ink than that Armenian
girl with the big tuchus.</i>

44:39.885 --> 44:42.753
<i>HEWES: Ellen's making
a name for herself.</i>

44:42.755 --> 44:44.922
<i>HERNDON: The fact is, the
trial's less than two weeks</i>

44:44.924 --> 44:46.023
<i>away, and now she's making</i>

44:46.025 --> 44:49.260
<i>McClaren looking like a
goddamn white knight.</i>

44:51.997 --> 44:52.997
<i>HEWES: I'm not worried.</i>

44:52.999 --> 44:56.133
<i>She still has to hand over
a list of his donors.</i>

44:56.135 --> 44:58.202
<i>(clears throat)</i>

45:01.706 --> 45:06.577
<i>NOVAK: Front page
on all of them.</i>

45:06.579 --> 45:08.312
<i>SIMON: Oh, beautiful.</i>

45:08.314 --> 45:10.781
<i>Just what we wanted.</i>

45:13.718 --> 45:14.852
<i>NOVAK: You happy?</i>

45:14.854 --> 45:16.787
<i>McCLAREN: That's good work.</i>

45:16.789 --> 45:19.356
<i>Both of you.</i>

45:27.332 --> 45:29.566
<i>HERNDON: You bring

45:29.568 --> 45:32.736
<i>PARSONS: McClarenTruth.org's

<i>I'll send you an electronic copy as well.</i>

45:41.112 --> 45:45.416
<i>HEWES: We asked for a list of
all of McClaren's donors.</i>

45:45.418 --> 45:48.552
<i>PARSONS: They're all
in front of you.</i>

45:54.192 --> 45:57.628
<i>HEWES: There's a name missing.</i>

45:57.630 --> 45:59.798
<i>PARSONS: What name?</i>

46:06.139 --> 46:09.175
<i>HEWES: Helmut Torben.</i>

46:12.679 --> 46:15.848
<i>PARSONS: To my knowledge Mr. Torben</i>
<i>has had no involvement,</i>

46:15.850 --> 46:20.153
<i>financial or otherwise,
with McClarenTruth.org.</i>

46:20.155 --> 46:22.688
<i>HEWES: Then your knowledge
is limited, isn't it?</i>

46:22.690 --> 46:25.024
<i>Well, doesn't matter.</i>

46:25.026 --> 46:27.826
<i>I've filed a request for all the</i>

<i>Mr. Torben to your client.</i>

46:32.166 --> 46:36.535
<i>If you don't hand it over, I'll</i>

46:36.537 --> 46:39.905
<i>have you thrown in jail for contempt.</i>

46:43.609 --> 46:46.778
<i>Mr. Torben is quite
a wealthy man.</i>

46:46.780 --> 46:51.749
<i>I'll be basing my request for

46:51.751 --> 46:55.820
<i>HERNDON: I'm surprised
as you are, kitten.</i>

46:58.723 --> 47:00.658
<i>HERNDON: Hey, what
the hell was that?</i>

47:00.660 --> 47:01.858
<i>HEWES: It's called leverage.</i>

47:01.860 --> 47:03.059
<i>HERNDON: Yeah, I know, I know</i>

47:03.061 --> 47:04.961
<i>that, but where did it come from?</i>

47:04.963 --> 47:07.163
<i>How did you conjure up Helmut Torben?</i>

47:07.165 --> 47:08.598
<i>HEWES: I made an arrangement.</i>

47:08.600 --> 47:11.667
<i>HERNDON: With who?</i>

47:11.669 --> 47:14.170
<i>With...</i>

47:27.453 --> 47:30.488
<i>HEWES: You were right.</i>

47:30.490 --> 47:33.024
<i>Ellen Parsons intended to hide</i>

47:33.026 --> 47:35.694
<i>what she knows about Helmut Torben.</i>

47:35.696 --> 47:37.462
<i>NOVAK: I only gave you this</i>

47:37.464 --> 47:38.830
<i>information, because I know that</i>

47:38.832 --> 47:41.800
<i>Channing did not hack Naomi
Wailing's personal e-mails.</i>

47:41.802 --> 47:45.770
<i>But I do believe that Torben
had something to do with it.</i>

47:45.772 --> 47:50.341
<i>HEWES: Well, I'm not interested
in going after an innocent man.</i>

47:50.343 --> 47:53.178
<i>If Torben is truly the guilty</i>

47:53.180 --> 47:58.716
<i>party behind all this, I'll make
sure he's prosecuted for it.</i>

48:00.853 --> 48:03.388
<i>You've taken quite a risk in
telling me about Torben.</i>

48:03.390 --> 48:05.890
<i>NOVAK: The biggest risk to
our organization is if</i>

48:05.892 --> 48:08.293
<i>Channing's reputation is destroyed.</i>

48:08.295 --> 48:11.563
<i>Nothing else matters.</i>

48:11.565 --> 48:15.533
<i>HEWES: Ms. Novak?</i>

48:15.535 --> 48:16.735
<i>Rutger Simon runs the business</i>

48:16.737 --> 48:19.704
<i>end of the organization, is that right?</i>

48:19.706 --> 48:20.805
<i>NOVAK: Yes, that's right.</i>

48:20.807 --> 48:21.973
<i>He does.</i>

48:21.975 --> 48:28.246
<i>HEWES: So, if anyone made a mistake taking
money from Torben, it's Mr. Simon.</i>

48:28.248 --> 48:29.514
<i>NOVAK: Absolutely.</i>

48:29.516 --> 48:33.318
<i>Channing isn't responsible for any of it.</i>

49:08.455 --> 49:09.520
<i>STEFANIA: Ah, yes.</i>

49:09.522 --> 49:13.590
<i>PATRICK: I had some business in town, so

<i>STEFANIA: Come, come, sit.</i>

49:15.861 --> 49:19.763

49:23.335 --> 49:25.602
<i>You still involved like you used to be?</i>

49:25.604 --> 49:26.770
<i>STEFANIA: No.</i>

49:26.772 --> 49:29.673
<i>The new Monsignor is asshole.</i>

49:29.675 --> 49:33.743
<i>I left Ellen Parsons' card on the table.</i>

<i>ORTIZ: Yeah, this knucklehead's
pulled a lot of</i>

49:50.995 --> 49:52.594
<i>crap, but it's all low-rent.</i>

49:52.596 --> 49:53.595
<i>Mostly theft.</i>

49:53.597 --> 49:55.898
<i>WILLIAMS: His name's
Patrick Scully.</i>

49:55.900 --> 49:58.800
<i>ORTIZ: Attempted murder seems
way out of his league.</i>

49:58.802 --> 50:00.869
<i>WILLIAMS: We checked his
last known address.</i>

50:00.871 --> 50:03.038
<i>It seems he left town several years ago.</i>

50:03.040 --> 50:04.106
<i>PARSONS: And?</i>

50:04.108 --> 50:06.308
<i>WILLIAMS: Well, apparently,
he's been clean ever since.</i>

50:06.310 --> 50:08.376
<i>PARSONS: So, there's
no way to locate him?</i>

50:08.378 --> 50:10.545

bulletin; if he pops up</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Miss Parsons, that's
about the best we can do.</i>

50:15.551 --> 50:17.584
<i>PARSONS: I understand.</i>

<i>Thanks for your help.</i>

<i>LYLE: Well, first we need
a new coat of paint.</i>

51:33.496 --> 51:38.166
