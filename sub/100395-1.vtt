and that's where it becomes
a pleasure to show a dog,

12:21.041 --> 12:24.776

ears, a width of skull.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.650
The skull and the foreface
approximately equal.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.652
We want a length of neck

over the croup

13:18.431 --> 13:19.831
down to the tail set

13:19.833 --> 13:23.101
so that the tail is carried
down and out, gently.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.336
It's important that
the tail stays down.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.505
Koko had it all.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.541
He was a lovely, lovely dog.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.855
When we took him
to the show ring,

15:57.857 --> 16:00.825
he thought every chick
in the paddock was his.

16:05.899 --> 16:08.132
He became full of himself.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.971
And up went the head
and up went the tail and...

16:12.973 --> 16:14.906
..he strutted.

16:17.344 --> 16:23.081
He just became a 16-year-old kid
that can't think clearly.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.318
He started to show poorly,

16:32.158 --> 16:34.125
he has what we call
a flat croup,

16:34.127 --> 16:36.527
which is the back end of
the dog, where the tail is.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.962
The croup is not correct.

The way Koko held his tail

16:45.505 --> 16:47.605
I believe was his attitude.

16:48.942 --> 16:50.641
He should never have
carried it that high.

16:50.643 --> 16:54.479
It's unreal that he had the

I read it and went,
"Ooh, this is it."

Red Dog had to be a very
specific kind of kelpie

21:08.301 --> 21:09.967

We have to find a dog whose
tail goes up. That is a given.

21:25.551 --> 21:28.953
So the casting of the dog
was absolutely critical,

so much time

connected with mine.

incredible spark.

with all these expressions.

look like that." But he did.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.328
We're making a film called
'Red Dog'

32:44.330 --> 32:46.630
and the dog's gotta be red,

32:46.632 --> 32:51.168
and our dogs are brown.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.905
The real Red Dog was red
because he lived in the Pilbara

32:54.907 --> 32:56.873
and was covered in red dust,

32:56.875 --> 33:00.610
but kelpies,
especially show kelpies,

33:00.612 --> 33:02.312
are bred to be chocolate brown.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.816
And we thought
it'd be relatively easy

33:05.818 --> 33:09.853
to dye the dogs red, but...

33:09.855 --> 33:13.290
..somehow that was not the case.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.858
And I looked at my first,

33:14.860 --> 33:16.593

"How'd the dye test go?"

right here,

34:19.591 --> 34:21.091
this is the new red colour.

34:21.092 --> 34:23.827
What we need to do now
is put another coat on

34:23.829 --> 34:27.397
and that colour will come
through like a Pilbara red.

Well, at least you're
the right colour now.

54:01.105 --> 54:02.404
Koko the kelpie.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.506
Len, he's on the telly!

54:04.508 --> 54:06.642
Quick, Len, you'll miss him!

54:06.644 --> 54:09.078
Every time he was on TV,
someone would ring me and say,

54:09.080 --> 54:11.447
"Carol, have you seen
so and so? It's on TV."

54:11.449 --> 54:14.116
I'd say, "Oh, hold on a minute!"
I'd have to change me channel.

54:14.118 --> 54:15.618
A new redhead is in town.

54:15.620 --> 54:19.355
Koko is the star of the new
Aussie film 'Red Dog'.

54:19.357 --> 54:22.691
He's gorgeous.
Just absolutely gorgeous.

54:22.693 --> 54:24.426
MAN: Audiences just love Koko.

54:24.428 --> 54:28.330
WOMAN: Oh, I just walked out of
the cinema and I just...

54:28.332 --> 54:30.766
I just wanted to go home
and hug my dog!

54:30.768 --> 54:33.435
Everyone went with
the Koko phenomenon.

54:34.372 --> 54:38.173
We got to travel
the entire country.

54:38.175 --> 54:41.377
And I enjoyed that,
and I think he did too.

54:41.379 --> 54:43.879
ANNOUNCER: Tonight, Sydney's
world-famous Opera House

54:43.881 --> 54:45.381
is the stage for Australia's

54:45.383 --> 54:48.117
most prestigious
screen industry awards.

54:48.119 --> 54:50.286
REPORTER: No, I'm not going to
be asking the dog questions.

54:50.288 --> 54:51.820
It's just he's
the first big star

54:51.822 --> 54:53.322
to arrive on
the red carpet here.

54:53.324 --> 54:56.659
NELSON: The film was nominated
at the first AACTAs

54:56.661 --> 55:00.329
and they brought Tim Minchin
to do 'Red Dog'.

55:00.331 --> 55:02.731
(SINGS) ¶ They cast a dog
in the leading role

55:02.733 --> 55:05.167
¶ Against some Yank
with a troubled soul

55:05.169 --> 55:07.236
¶ And in the moment
mutual love is found

55:07.238 --> 55:09.505
¶ They kill the bloke
then kill the hound

55:09.507 --> 55:11.573
¶ And even though
we think we're tough

55:11.575 --> 55:13.609
¶ And we saw it coming
from a mile off

55:13.611 --> 55:15.744
¶ They have us sobbing
like suckers

55:15.746 --> 55:18.180
¶ Those manipulative
f...ilm-makers

55:18.182 --> 55:20.182
-¶ Red Dog, Red Dog
-¶ Red Dog

55:20.184 --> 55:22.184
¶ He was a dog and he was red

55:22.186 --> 55:24.453
-¶ He was a live dog, live dog
-¶ Live dog

55:24.455 --> 55:26.555
¶ But by the credits,
he was dead. ¶

55:27.692 --> 55:28.857
(SONG ENDS)

55:32.496 --> 55:34.463
He's pretty method,
which is impressive.

55:34.465 --> 55:36.298
I would have sworn
I was watching a dog.

55:36.300 --> 55:38.167
I taught him
everything he knows.

55:38.169 --> 55:40.669
What actor would I
compare him to?

55:40.671 --> 55:43.038
-Gregory Peck.
-Colin Friels.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.441
Schwarzenegger, OK? Why not?

55:45.443 --> 55:47.343
(APPLAUSE)

55:47.345 --> 55:51.113
And the Samsung AACTA Award
for Best Film goes to...

55:52.049 --> 55:53.048
..'Red Dog'.

55:53.050 --> 55:55.284
Nelson Woss and Julie Ryan.

55:55.286 --> 55:57.319
ANNOUNCER: 'Red Dog'
was nominated for

55:57.321 --> 55:59.722
a total of seven
AACTA awards this year.

55:59.724 --> 56:03.659
For it to do what it actually
did blew our minds.

56:03.661 --> 56:06.261
You'd be at a restaurant,

56:06.263 --> 56:08.263
and suddenly you'd hear
at the table next to you,

56:08.265 --> 56:09.965
"You've gotta see
this new film.

56:09.967 --> 56:12.701
"It's called 'Red Dog'. There's
this amazing dog in it."

56:14.605 --> 56:18.240
More and more people
were seeing him on screen

56:18.242 --> 56:19.875
and falling in love with him.

56:20.811 --> 56:22.244
It blew up.

56:28.285 --> 56:30.519
Koko got invited everywhere.

56:30.521 --> 56:33.489
London. Berlin. Dallas.

56:33.491 --> 56:36.358
I heard 'dog'
and my ears went up.

56:36.360 --> 56:39.828
'Red Dog' is top dog at this
year's Heartland Film Fest.

56:39.830 --> 56:41.296
If you're an animal lover,

56:41.298 --> 56:42.931
first of all you're gonna
love this movie.

56:42.933 --> 56:44.466
You're gonna love your dog
even more.

56:44.468 --> 56:46.435
The dog's expression
was tremendous.

56:46.437 --> 56:50.839
And the Golden Collar
goes to Koko in 'Red Dog'.

56:52.343 --> 56:53.776
NELSON: He was it.

56:55.312 --> 56:59.615
Koko got so popular, he was
offered roles in other movies.

56:59.617 --> 57:02.217
There's always one,
whether it's a pig or...

57:02.219 --> 57:04.887
There's always one with that
extra bit of personality.

57:04.889 --> 57:07.256
George Miller called me
to ask me about Koko,

57:07.258 --> 57:09.091
because he wanted to put him
in 'Fury Road'.

57:09.093 --> 57:11.427
You know, I said,
"Yeah, he's great."

57:11.429 --> 57:13.162
And he was
in that opening scene,

57:13.164 --> 57:15.130
you know, with Tom Hardy,

57:15.132 --> 57:16.932
but they ended up replacing him

57:16.934 --> 57:18.567
with that two-headed
lizard thing.

57:19.503 --> 57:22.404
Everything just became huge.

57:23.441 --> 57:26.942
And we kind of knew
that the reason it did

57:26.944 --> 57:28.744
was Koko.

57:32.416 --> 57:36.351
The next step was to take Koko
and the film overseas.

57:37.354 --> 57:39.254
And we had been asked

57:39.256 --> 57:42.524
to do a gag on stage

57:42.526 --> 57:44.760
and we wanted to say thank you

57:44.762 --> 57:47.830
to the people
that had seen the film.

57:49.200 --> 57:53.235
There were... A couple of
presenters introduced the film.

57:54.205 --> 57:59.107
So the Event Cinemas IF Award
for Box Office Achievement

57:59.109 --> 58:00.843
goes to 'Red Dog'.

58:04.114 --> 58:07.783
And then I was to go out
and accept the award

58:07.785 --> 58:10.219
and start thanking people.

58:10.221 --> 58:12.654
But really, we all knew that

58:12.656 --> 58:15.224
people didn't want
to listen to me

58:15.226 --> 58:17.259
and the gag was
that I should shut up

58:17.261 --> 58:21.463
and...and that Koko
would run out.

58:23.234 --> 58:24.800
And he did it.

58:24.802 --> 58:26.735
He nailed it.
He came straight out.

58:30.007 --> 58:32.574
But I could see
something was wrong.

58:33.744 --> 58:36.311
I would never have to
hold Koko on the lead

58:36.313 --> 58:40.115
or hold him by his collar,

58:40.117 --> 58:41.617
because he was so...

58:41.619 --> 58:43.986
He was so good,
he knew what he had to do.

58:43.988 --> 58:45.854
He would just do it
by my side.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.422
I'd never have to hold him.

58:47.424 --> 58:49.157
But I could see...

58:49.159 --> 58:52.427
I could see the moment
he came out on stage,

58:52.429 --> 58:53.795
he wasn't comfortable.

58:53.797 --> 58:56.765
I grabbed him by the collar...

58:58.802 --> 59:02.604
..and then we walked off stage.

59:03.941 --> 59:06.041
And...

59:06.043 --> 59:08.844
..it's just because
I was used to...

59:10.114 --> 59:12.281
I was used to not...not...

59:13.217 --> 59:15.284
..holding him, I let him go.

59:16.287 --> 59:18.554
And he just ran.

59:18.556 --> 59:20.422
He ran straight
into the audience.

59:20.424 --> 59:22.391
Man, I was so scared,

59:22.393 --> 59:24.426
because I'd never
seen him do that before.

59:24.428 --> 59:26.762
I knew something was wrong.

59:26.764 --> 59:28.497
I knew something was very wrong.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.500
He wasn't enjoying it.

59:31.502 --> 59:33.468
And as soon as I saw that,

59:33.470 --> 59:35.571
I wasn't gonna
let him do it anymore.

59:41.145 --> 59:44.813
(SOMBRE MUSIC)

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:12.507
VET: So this is a lateral X-ray,

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:15.177
showing Koko's heart
from the side.

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:17.646
And his heart's quite enlarged.

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:20.282
It's causing the trachea
to be displaced

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:22.718
up towards his backbone here

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.153
and the size of the heart is
actually quite enlarged

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:27.456
both that way and
that dimension as well.

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:31.126
The main symptoms
you normally see early are

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.128
there's often a change
in behaviour.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.497
So the dog will become
exercise-intolerant.

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.899
They're not gonna be
so keen to go for a walk.

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:39.901
They're not gonna make the
same distance they used to.

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:41.403
They tire out a lot quicker.

01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:44.473
RICK: I liken it to
any sort of pump.

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:46.341
You know, whether it's
a fuel pump, whatever.

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:48.043
If the valves aren't
working properly,

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:49.911
the pump isn't
working properly.

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:52.347
JEROME: Sometimes
as it progresses,

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.683
you'll notice a change
in breathing behaviour.

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:57.719
So they'll start panting,
they'll have shallow breathing,

01:00:57.721 --> 01:00:59.488
belaboured breathing.

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:02.824
NELSON: The best we could do was

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:05.460
put him on some medication

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:09.364
that would make him comfortable

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:12.668
and let him continue
enjoying being a dog.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:17.806
We made sure that his condition
was really closely monitored.

01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:21.309
And the feeling was
as long as he was happy

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:25.047
and enjoying being a dog
and enjoying his life,

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:27.382
we would do everything
that we could

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:29.518
to make sure
it could be continued.

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:37.059
It's alright, mate.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.465
Initially, when we
started treating Koko,

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:47.069
Nelson informed us that his
energy levels had picked up,

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.004
he was a lot more active again.

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:50.706
The coughing had resolved
at least initially,

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.141
so he did see
a marked improvement.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:56.478
And now Koko's, you know,
almost back to normal.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.013
He's enjoying
a good quality of life.

01:01:58.015 --> 01:01:59.981
He's enjoying going
for a walk in the park

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.117
and yeah, for the moment,
he's stabilised well.

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:04.152
REPORTER:
Earlier this week, Koko,

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:06.021
who's retired from
his film career,

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:09.424
made a cameo appearance at the
RSPCA's Malaga headquarters.

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:10.926
He was on hand to present...

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:12.627
NELSON: I wanted to learn

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:14.196
everything I could
possibly learn

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.631
about what was wrong with him

01:02:16.633 --> 01:02:19.234
in the hope that we could
help him.

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:23.939
And we did have great success
with some of the medication,

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:26.541
and I wanted to let people know

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:30.312
and I didn't want people
to go through

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:31.913
what we were going through.

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:35.951
He was my best friend.

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:39.521
He was very, very close
to my daughter.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:42.390
Just remember
that he's a little old,

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:44.960
so just be gentle
with him, OK?

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:46.561
GIRL: Alright.

01:02:46.563 --> 01:02:49.798
NELSON: He got along
pretty well with her.

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:54.469
He was back to
his normal self...

01:02:56.974 --> 01:03:00.208
..for a while and then, uh...

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:03.912
..he started to decline again.

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:11.853
Eventually, if the valves are
just not functional enough,

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:15.323
nothing's going to fix the case.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.161
NELSON: It's catching up
with him.

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:26.601
We're just taking it
day by day right now.

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:29.571
(SOMBRE MUSIC)

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:37.712
Koko and I lived in
a pretty unique spot.

01:03:45.722 --> 01:03:48.123
Koko woke up that day...

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:51.693
..and...

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:55.497
..very quickly, I think,
he knew and I knew that

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.900
his condition had
deteriorated a lot.

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:03.738
I think...
he had just had enough.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.409
You could tell.
He expressed it. He emoted it.

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:12.781
Koko was outside in the garden.

01:04:12.783 --> 01:04:16.685
I remember he loved
that garden and he...

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.728
He did a walk-around.
He did one lap of it.

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:39.975
I called the vet, Jerome,

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:43.511
and I said,
"You better come round.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.347
"He's not looking good."

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:51.386
And Jerome came around
and he said that

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.723
it's probably got to the point

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:59.027
where he's no longer
comfortable.

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:01.062
And he looked at us

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.064
and...

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.433
..you could just tell -

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:08.303
he...he said, "I'm ready."

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:14.109
And Jerome was ready

01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:15.977
and...

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:21.816
..and Koko...

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:25.353
..was gone.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.127
CAROL: This is gonna
break me up.

01:05:32.129 --> 01:05:36.164
I'll never forget the phone call
I got from Nelson.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.001
And that was
just before Christmas.

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:48.209
And my phone rang, my mobile,
and I answered it.

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:50.979
And he said,
"Oh, it's Nelson here."

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:54.516
And I said, "Gee, you don't
sound very good."

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:02.958
I didn't know what to say to him

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.995
because I felt as though
I'd been stabbed with something.

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:12.600
To lose a dog is heart-rending.

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:15.770
It tears a part of you away.

01:06:15.772 --> 01:06:18.106
It's like losing a limb.

01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:20.909
You know, you spend
your time afterwards

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:23.578
putting an extra bowl
on the table

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.414
that is no longer
going to be emptied.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.250
(WAVES LAP GENTLY)

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:31.853
And it's like losing
a part of you.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:42.864
WOMAN: The canine star of the
hit film 'Red Dog' has died.

01:06:42.866 --> 01:06:45.266
Koko became
Australia's best-known dog

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:47.335
after the film's release
last year.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.704
The 7-year-old red kelpie

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:51.473
died of heart
disease in Perth.

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:52.974
The kelpie
who starred in

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:55.010
the hit movie
'Red Dog' has died.

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:57.278
7-year-old Koko,
the dog's real name,

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.381
died this morning
from heart disease.

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:01.883
'Red Dog' told the story
of a red cloud kelpie

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:03.318
who roamed
the Pilbara outback...

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.388
NELSON: It was
the shelter's idea.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:09.090
They wanted to
celebrate his life.

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:12.460
The sort of two or three days
after Koko passed away

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:13.661
and we started
getting donations in,

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:15.063
it was just astronomical.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:16.664
The phones ran off the hooks.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.333
There was just
donations coming in,

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:20.135
just an outpouring of grief

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:22.237
as if people had actually
lost their own dog.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:25.306
Koko brought
all the communities,

01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:27.675
basically, round Australia,
together

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:31.012
and all the communities
in Australia liked Koko.

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:34.082
Koko's legacy definitely
lives on here at Shenton Park.

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:37.852
More than anything, he's
helping to save dogs in need.

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:40.989
NELSON: I think it was something

01:07:40.991 --> 01:07:45.460
that when the shelter
decided to build a statue,

01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:46.861
they wanted to celebrate.

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:51.332
It was just probably one of
the most moving moments

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:54.302
that I had with the dogs.

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:57.839
I only owned Koko in
the last years of his life.

01:07:57.841 --> 01:08:02.410
Koko was bred by Len and Carol
Hobday in Dunolly, Victoria,

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.980
and Carol gave me
perhaps the greatest gift

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:08.216
that anyone could give,
which was

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:11.653
she allowed me to keep Koko
after filming.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.658
He was a different dog.

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:20.761
It didn't matter who you were

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:23.231
or what your background was,

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:25.667
he'd walk straight up to you

01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:28.937
and he was interested
to get to know you.

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:33.006
If you were open
to getting to know him,

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:36.044
he would immediately
connect with you.

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:41.015
When you think about that,
that's pretty special.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:45.920
A lot of times, you're not open
to connecting with people,

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.689
whereas Koko did that
unconditionally

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:51.960
and had a way of breaking
through people's barriers.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:55.130
I remember sitting
in front of the monitor.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.932
Nelson had gone to get
a coffee or something,

01:08:57.934 --> 01:08:59.434
and Koko was there

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:02.237
and my hand was just sort of
like this at the chair.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:06.875
And I just felt something,
and he was wanting a pat.

01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:12.680
And I felt, really,
"Oh, that's so sweet."

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:15.617
He could always tell
I had a vibe, I think.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.551
There was always
a bit of a tension there

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:19.621
but it was just a really nice,
lovely moment.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:22.323
I just gave him a good little
scratch around the ears.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.261
Yeah, and then I had
to put cream on my hand

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.162
for the next two weeks.

01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:32.667
JOSH: They accept you
completely,

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.169
I think is what it is.

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.670
You know, human beings,
we always have

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.939
these strong, complex
interpersonal relationships.

01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:39.774
There's a lot of judgement
involved.

01:09:39.776 --> 01:09:41.809
And dogs, I feel like,
not only don't judge you,

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:44.912
but they totally accept you
for who you are

01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:47.749
the same way you gotta
accept a dog for who he is.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:50.752
When the movie was out,

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:55.089
I went to one of the theatres
in Melbourne for the premiere.

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:58.593
And Nelson was there
and Koko was there.

01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:02.096
NELSON: And the audience
loved it, and he was on.

01:10:02.098 --> 01:10:04.265
And he was loving it.

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:06.935
But all of a sudden you could
see him. He was like...

01:10:06.937 --> 01:10:09.437
(SNIFFS) He could
smell something.

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:11.639
And when he saw me...
Oh, go away.

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.441
When he saw me,

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:17.545
he just went spare,
he really did.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.114
And as I cuddled him, he
started to chew me necklace!

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:21.883
(LAUGHS) I couldn't believe it.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:24.152
I thought,
"OK, this is still Koko."

01:10:24.154 --> 01:10:26.788
He might be a star,
but it was still Koko.

01:10:30.193 --> 01:10:33.194
I think it's a psychological
need to be loved.

01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:37.365
And a dog will give you that.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:41.869
Doesn't matter what you are,
what you look like,

01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:44.005
your dog will love you

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:45.406
unconditionally.

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:47.909
NELSON: In life...

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:52.647
..sometimes you have unique
and special relationships.

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:55.383
They can be with your family

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.819
or your friends

01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:59.721
or your dog.

01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:03.291
And you should enjoy them.

01:11:03.293 --> 01:11:08.196
You should make the most of them
and be there in the moment

01:11:08.198 --> 01:11:11.299
no matter what else
is going on in your life

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:12.667
or what you think's important

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:14.135
or whatever's stressing you out,

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:17.138
because those relationships
and those moments

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:18.339
don't last forever.

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:22.977
Koko was always in the moment

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:25.213
and when you were with Koko,

01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:29.350
you were in the moment...
with him.

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:33.454
And I cherished that,
loved that.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:39.394
I think everyone's dog
or everyone's special companion

01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:41.029
can make you feel that way.

01:11:41.031 --> 01:11:43.064
One...

01:11:43.066 --> 01:11:44.966
