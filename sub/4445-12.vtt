-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain.
- Hello, Ms. Velders.

00:04.538 --> 00:08.040
- An old, rich guy hired us
to crash most Internet traffic.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.776
- Eldritch Palmer.
- I never wanted to hurt people.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.379
- What the hell
happened to you?

00:13.381 --> 00:15.848
(Kelly screaming)

00:20.221 --> 00:22.354
(panting)

00:22.356 --> 00:25.357
- He is nesting somewhere
in the city. We could find him

00:25.359 --> 00:27.326
<i> if we work together.</i>

00:27.328 --> 00:30.362
- I am a drinker of men.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.568
(vampires screaming)

00:39.006 --> 00:42.708
- Why did you ignite the light
bomb?! - We had no choice!

00:42.710 --> 00:46.211
- He was right there!
Right within my grasp!

00:46.213 --> 00:50.315
- No way, Pops.
- He is here! Unhand me!

00:50.317 --> 00:52.151
- For God's sake,
this is suicide!

00:52.153 --> 00:55.821
- No! No! No! No!

00:58.059 --> 01:00.492
(emergency vehicle sirens)

01:07.234 --> 01:10.002
- Your pulse is slowing...

01:10.004 --> 01:12.204
and your heart
is struggling, Eldritch.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.273
I can hear it.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.943
- Is he here now?

01:17.945 --> 01:20.345
- Oh, no,

01:20.347 --> 01:22.881
I came here on my own.

01:22.883 --> 01:27.286
- I've kept my part
of the agreement;

01:27.288 --> 01:29.621
the Master will keep his.

01:29.623 --> 01:33.058
- He will not be compelled

01:33.060 --> 01:35.060
or coerced.

01:35.062 --> 01:38.430
He is the Master.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.867
He does...

01:41.869 --> 01:43.936
or he does not.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.605
- I used every resource

01:46.607 --> 01:48.607
at my disposal.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.642
No one else could have done
his bidding

01:50.644 --> 01:53.312
as I have.

01:53.314 --> 01:57.449
- And if he denies you
what you want?

01:57.451 --> 02:01.820
What if he sent me instead...

02:01.822 --> 02:05.290
in order to offer you
your last rites?

02:05.292 --> 02:08.460
- He will save me.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.296
He still needs me.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.000
I have faith.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.239
(theme music)

02:32.987 --> 02:35.587
(emergency vehicle siren)
(vehicle honking)

02:35.589 --> 02:38.524
(glass shattering)
(people shouting)

02:47.268 --> 02:49.535
(man shouting)
(glass shattering)

02:51.438 --> 02:55.174
- Zack, we're back!

02:56.710 --> 02:59.211
Zack, we're back.
- Dad!

03:01.348 --> 03:03.348
- Ah!

03:03.350 --> 03:06.185
I'm so sorry we didn't come back
when I said we would.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.356
- It's alright.
Did you get him?

03:11.358 --> 03:14.293
- No. I got close.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.297
I guess close
doesn't count, though.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.635
- Finally.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.539
- Everything OK here?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.409
- Yep. Fine.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.945
- Sure?
- Yep.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.888
- Please,

04:16.890 --> 04:19.124
give me strength.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.539
- 500<i> lek.</i>
- Sir, no.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.576
- 800<i> lek.</i> I'm just
taking her up the river.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.378
- No, no.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.713
- It's not the price, is it?
It's the destination.

04:41.715 --> 04:45.417
The castle? The ruins?
Has anyone else

04:45.419 --> 04:47.486
enquired about
Castle Drisht recently?

04:47.488 --> 04:51.156
<i> Kalaja e Drishtit?</i> A German?

04:51.158 --> 04:53.558
Well-dressed?
Only comes at night?

04:55.496 --> 04:58.630
Are there any people
missing from the villages?

05:00.301 --> 05:02.601
2000<i> lek.</i>

05:02.603 --> 05:04.603
I buy her.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.072
2000.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.107
(girl speaking
in foreign language)

05:09.109 --> 05:10.909
(dog barking)

05:12.846 --> 05:15.213
(chicken cackling)
(villagers talking)

05:24.925 --> 05:27.092
Miriam!

05:27.094 --> 05:29.094
That farmer was terrified.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.364
He could sense an evil presence.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.466
We're so close
this time, so close.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.636
- Abraham, you have said
these words before.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.705
- He's here, I know it.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.142
A victory here would validate
our lives' work

05:44.144 --> 05:46.144
and avenge the deaths
of Frankel and Jurgis,

05:46.146 --> 05:48.780
and shame those
who have denounced us.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.452
The castle is a half-day's ride.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.954
I'll be back before sundown.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.323
- Promise me...

05:58.325 --> 06:00.359
if you see signs of nesting,

06:00.361 --> 06:03.061
you will get away.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.197
You should not do this alone.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.834
- I'm never alone, Miriam.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.036
You're with me every step.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.674
- Please, Abraham...

06:15.676 --> 06:17.743
do not let vengeance cloud

06:17.745 --> 06:19.845
your vision.
- I know your heart,

06:19.847 --> 06:23.415
I know the toll my obsessions
have taken on our lives

06:23.417 --> 06:25.917
and the sacrifices
you have made.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.722
After this is finished,

06:30.724 --> 06:32.858
we'll settle down in peace.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.927
We'll adopt.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.331
A boy and girl, yes?

06:39.333 --> 06:41.400
Just like
you've always wanted.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.508
- Until sundown.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.743
No later.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.130
- Next time.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.233
- Do you know how long
I have hunted him?

07:15.235 --> 07:18.703
My last encounter with him
was... decades ago.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.473
There may be no next time.

07:21.475 --> 07:25.243
- You should rest.
- Please,

07:25.245 --> 07:27.712
Dr. Martinez, leave me alone.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.085
- What is this?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.421
Is this a vampire heart?

07:36.423 --> 07:39.991
How did you... How old is it?

07:39.993 --> 07:42.894
- I asked you
to leave me alone.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.730
- You've kept it here, why?
- STOP with your questions!

07:55.909 --> 07:58.543
(people chattering)

08:07.120 --> 08:10.789
- Mr. Alonzo Creem.
You remember me?

08:10.791 --> 08:13.625
- Yeah, I remember you.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.127
- Give me your gun.
(tires screeching)

08:16.129 --> 08:18.296
You think I'm playing with you?!
Give me your gun!

08:18.298 --> 08:20.665
Slowly.

08:23.770 --> 08:27.005
Now, start the car and drive.
(dog barking)

08:31.111 --> 08:33.645
- Best approximation,
we were right

08:33.647 --> 08:36.114
about here when we saw that
horde of vamps in the tunnel.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.817
- A radius of half a block
in either direction.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.319
- Yeah.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.522
- OK, is nobody gonna
bring this up but me?

08:43.524 --> 08:45.557
You guys saw what happened
with Setrakian back there.

08:45.559 --> 08:49.160
- Oh... He was upset.
It's understandable.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.162
- Upset?

08:51.164 --> 08:53.164
He wanted the four of us
to take on

08:53.166 --> 08:56.401
maybe a thousand vampires. That
did happen. You saw that, right?

08:56.403 --> 08:58.904
- He's been on this hunt
for a long time, Doc.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.407
- So, it was just
a senior moment?

09:02.409 --> 09:04.576
Is nobody questioning this
but me?!

09:04.578 --> 09:08.179
- I think you're overreacting.
- I hear you,

09:08.181 --> 09:10.148
but what choice do we have?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.250
- OK, good to know.
So it is just me.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.319
(banging and shaking
of front gate)

09:17.024 --> 09:20.592
- Would you look at that?
(banging on front gate)

09:27.901 --> 09:29.868
- Miss me?

09:29.870 --> 09:32.337
- Now that you mention it.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.275
(A woman screams.)

09:37.277 --> 09:39.344
- (man): Run out!

09:44.451 --> 09:46.885
(people talking outside)

09:46.887 --> 09:49.020
- (man): Nothing is working!
(emergency vehicle siren)

09:53.560 --> 09:55.460
- What happened?

09:55.462 --> 09:57.729
Is everyone OK?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.898
- As good as can be expected.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.234
Did you bring us some pizzas
in there or what?

10:03.236 --> 10:06.571
- Better. I brought you a plan.

10:06.573 --> 10:10.241
- We don't need any more plans;
what we need is a win.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.644
(siren blaring)
- OK then.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.813
I've brought you a win.

10:20.921 --> 10:24.089
I'm gonna set up here, OK?

10:24.091 --> 10:26.091
- Where did you steal
that stuff from?

10:26.093 --> 10:29.127
- Look, I get it, yeah.
We're never gonna be best mates.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.630
It breaks my heart, truly,

10:31.632 --> 10:34.265
but you need me
even if you don't know it yet.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.501
- Oh, is this the time where
I remind you that you broke

10:36.503 --> 10:39.471
the Internet?

10:39.473 --> 10:41.640
- Ever heard of
the Emergency Alert System?

10:41.642 --> 10:44.309
- It's that thing that always
interrupts the radio

10:44.311 --> 10:47.412
and television. Now,
"This is only a test," right?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.148
- Established to allow the
president to address the nation

10:50.150 --> 10:52.817
in a time of war
or national crisis,

10:52.819 --> 10:55.787
for 50 years
throughout various incarnations.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.789
It's never been used,
not once.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.791
Not even on 9-11.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.460
- Well, that's because we have
24-hour news stations now.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.764
- Broadcasting bullshit stories
about strange influenzas,

11:05.766 --> 11:07.932
random violence,
celebrity weddings--

11:07.934 --> 11:10.001
- I can cut
through all that noise.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.671
Broadcast, cable, satellite,
I can put you

11:12.673 --> 11:16.441
on every television and radio
in this country, unfiltered

11:16.443 --> 11:18.276
and uncensored.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.379
(Velders typing on keyboard)

11:24.651 --> 11:26.851
- I'm an escaped fugitive
wanted for murder,

11:26.853 --> 11:29.020
who's going to believe me?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.022
- Use that notoriety, Doc.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.024
People know who you are,

11:33.026 --> 11:35.026
that you worked for the CDC.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.362
Make some noise.
Get people talking!

11:37.364 --> 11:39.364
- Hmm, with your charm,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.466
the sky's the limit.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.202
- It actually could work.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.372
- Not could, it will.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.709
Now, figure out what you can say
in about 30 to 40 seconds

11:50.711 --> 11:52.911
to wake up the world.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.415

11:59.653 --> 12:01.653
- (Creem):
What's your name again?

12:01.655 --> 12:04.055
- They call me Gus.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.725
- I'm just curious. Hmm.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.561
Why take me off among all
the people you can go after?

12:09.563 --> 12:11.563
- Well, I needed guns,

12:11.565 --> 12:13.765
ammo, money;

12:13.767 --> 12:16.668
you seemed like a safe bet.
- Whoa, what do you think

12:16.670 --> 12:19.571
you know about me?
- I know enough.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.941
- Here's the problem, "Gus,"

12:22.943 --> 12:24.909
I have a lot of friends,

12:24.911 --> 12:26.911
friends that want
to do me favors;

12:26.913 --> 12:28.913
and once you steal from me,

12:28.915 --> 12:30.915
a lot of people are going
to want to get on my good side

12:30.917 --> 12:34.352
by finding you.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.255

12:37.257 --> 12:39.591
A plague broke out,

12:39.593 --> 12:43.261

There's about to be
a whole lot of chaos,

12:45.265 --> 12:47.565
ain't nobody finding me.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.634
I'm gonna fool the system
into thinking it's receiving

18:56.636 --> 18:58.769
the weekly "This is only
a test" test.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.006
And then it's lights,
camera, Dr. Serious.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.108
- You can do
all that from here?

19:04.110 --> 19:08.146
- Not here. This... hunk
of consumer electronics

19:08.148 --> 19:10.648
is just a dumb
sending-receiving unit;

19:10.650 --> 19:12.984
bypassing the satcom encryption

19:12.986 --> 19:15.153
from my laptop, now that's
gonna be the tricky part.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.221
That is an NSA-level hack.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.058
- How did you get started
doing all this stuff?

19:22.762 --> 19:24.762
- It's a long story,
some other time.

19:24.764 --> 19:28.499
- I assume that you answered
an ad in<i> Misfits Quarterly.</i>

19:28.501 --> 19:31.035
You know, some
correspondence course

19:31.037 --> 19:33.037
for antisocial anarchists.
(Velders laughs.)

19:33.039 --> 19:34.972
(distant window shattering)
- Where?

19:34.974 --> 19:37.542
My dad worked
for New York Telephone

19:37.544 --> 19:39.677
tracing phone phreakers.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.547
And then the phone
monopoly broke up,

19:42.549 --> 19:45.650
and he moved
into cybersecurity.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.653
Right about the time phreakers
were turning into hackers.

19:48.655 --> 19:51.155
- You rebelled
against Pops, huh?

19:51.157 --> 19:53.691
(distant siren blaring)
- No. No, I loved my dad.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.461
He used to go undercover

19:57.463 --> 19:59.530
to these hackathons
and take me along.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.200
He saw that hackers

20:02.202 --> 20:06.204
were more curious
than malicious.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.006
Had he, uh,
been born a few years later,

20:09.008 --> 20:11.075
he would have been one, too.

20:11.077 --> 20:14.912
- Uh, well, wait a second.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.382
What you did to the Internet,
that was, uh...

20:18.384 --> 20:20.551
that was plenty malicious.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.289
- Yeah, well, I lost my way.

20:27.026 --> 20:30.695
- That's why you came back?
To fix things?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.730
(helicopter flying by)

20:32.732 --> 20:35.399
- That and...
I left a really good

20:35.401 --> 20:37.902
pair of boots here.
(sirens blaring)

20:37.904 --> 20:41.606
- Ha! Hmm!

20:41.608 --> 20:43.774
You know, I'm pretty good
at New York accents,

20:43.776 --> 20:46.310
but yours, I can't
seem to place.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.582
- I met a London girl,
moved across the ocean for her.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.585
- It's love, I guess.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.755
(tires screeching)
(vehicle honking)

20:57.757 --> 21:00.992
- My dad died when I was 12
of a heart attack.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.463
My mom took it pretty hard,

21:05.465 --> 21:09.233
married too quickly
to a pompous shithead.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.569
Things were pretty bad
after that,

21:11.571 --> 21:13.938
and I left home when I was 15.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.307
So much for love.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.846
More details you require?

21:23.883 --> 21:26.651
- Only one.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.622
Men or women?

21:33.493 --> 21:35.593
- I specialize in passionate,

21:35.595 --> 21:39.063
destructive relationships.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.999
(dog barking in the distance)
- The best kind.

21:45.238 --> 21:47.571
(electronic buzzing)

21:47.573 --> 21:50.341
(beeping)
- And we're up.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.909
- Alright.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.185
(emergency vehicle siren)
(vehicles honking)

22:01.187 --> 22:02.987
(glass shattering outside)

22:02.989 --> 22:05.022
- You are preparing a speech?

22:05.024 --> 22:07.191
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Martinez.

22:07.193 --> 22:08.959
A very important speech.

22:08.961 --> 22:12.663
- My Nora was first in her class
at public speaking.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.800
She won every debate
at school.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.369
And most of them at home.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.371
- She still does.
- (Nora): Mama?

22:20.373 --> 22:23.541
- She's here in the kitchen.
- Why aren't you in bed?

22:23.543 --> 22:27.278
I came to check on you.
- I couldn't sleep. The noises,

22:27.280 --> 22:29.714
the sirens, it...

22:29.716 --> 22:32.116
- No, no, no. No more smoking.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.285
Come on, go to sleep.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.457
I'll sleep with you tonight, OK?
(Nora kisses her mom.)

22:39.459 --> 22:41.525
(helicopter whirring)

22:43.529 --> 22:46.997
(people talking loudly outside)
(Nora sighs.)

22:46.999 --> 22:49.533
The mother is the daughter;
and the daughter is the mother.

22:49.535 --> 22:52.236
- It's how life goes, huh?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.943
(sighing)

23:03.149 --> 23:05.282
(helicopter whirring)

23:08.254 --> 23:10.321
(vehicles honking)

23:13.159 --> 23:14.892
- Yeah, buddy.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.599
(alarm ringing)

23:21.601 --> 23:23.768
(beeping)

23:23.770 --> 23:25.770
(The alarm stops.)

23:25.772 --> 23:27.838
Go easy, man! Easy!

23:27.840 --> 23:29.673
You'll get your head knocked on.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.976
(distant siren blaring)

23:33.913 --> 23:35.880
- I got an AR-15,

23:35.882 --> 23:39.450
MP-5 and a couple
of pistols. Now, take

23:39.452 --> 23:42.420
and leave. Never ever
let me see your face again.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.422
(car approaching)

23:44.424 --> 23:46.524
- Yo, who's that?
- Nobody.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.659
- Creem, who's that?!

23:50.430 --> 23:54.265
- Look, just a delivery
I'm expecting. I'll handle it.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.400
He'll be in and out
in two minutes.

23:56.402 --> 23:59.470
- Get him out of here.
(buzzing)

24:02.141 --> 24:04.608
- Greg, come on in.

24:09.382 --> 24:11.816
Don't worry about him.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.919
He works for me. Logistics.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.087
- We dropped the container

24:17.089 --> 24:19.123
this afternoon. Spot D-42.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.593
- Yeah, good, good. It will be
shipped out in the morning.

24:22.595 --> 24:25.229
- Any problem, let me know.
- Of course, my brother.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.398
You have a good night.

24:31.737 --> 24:34.872
- Yo-yo-yo! Yo-yo!
Let me see what's in the bag.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.510
What's in the bag, brah?

24:45.351 --> 24:47.318
(Gus laughing)

24:49.255 --> 24:51.655
Now, that's what
I'm talking about, Creem!

24:51.657 --> 24:54.625
- Look, you got your guns.
Get that shit

24:54.627 --> 24:56.627
and get the hell out of here
while you still got a chance.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.096
- If that dude is willing
to pay you this much

24:59.098 --> 25:01.098
to ship some containers,

25:01.100 --> 25:03.100
then what's in there
has got to be worth

25:03.102 --> 25:05.369
a whole hell of a lot more
than what's in here.

25:05.371 --> 25:08.105
So I want to take a look-see.

25:10.309 --> 25:13.377
(car alarm ringing)

25:13.379 --> 25:16.480
- Ready for your close-up?
(glass shattering)

25:16.482 --> 25:19.116
- Do you think we should maybe
do this in the morning

25:19.118 --> 25:21.118
when people are awake?
- They can override

25:21.120 --> 25:23.621
our feed in the TV-station
control booth. We want

25:23.623 --> 25:25.623
to exploit the inexperience
of the overnight shift.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.892
An extra 10 seconds
of airtime can be critical,

25:27.894 --> 25:31.328
so put the good stuff
at the top, yeah?

25:31.330 --> 25:34.198
- (woman):<i> ...protect us.</i>
<i> Where are they?</i>

25:34.200 --> 25:36.500
<i> Here, they're all vulnerable.</i>
<i> They're not idiots.</i>

25:36.502 --> 25:39.036
- (man):<i> Really? You think</i>
<i> more guns on our streets</i>

25:39.038 --> 25:41.372
<i> is the answer? I can't think</i>
<i> of anything less likely</i>

25:41.374 --> 25:43.374

25:43.376 --> 25:45.409

<i> but thank you...</i>

25:45.411 --> 25:48.646
- 40 years ago,
I came to this country...

25:48.648 --> 25:51.549
defeated.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.385
I had dedicated my life
to hunting the Master

25:54.387 --> 25:57.321
and his ilk,
but at that moment, I...

25:59.258 --> 26:01.325
...I turned my back
on that quest.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.863
The, uh... evil

26:05.865 --> 26:07.898
that had presided
over this world

26:07.900 --> 26:10.267
for so many centuries

26:10.269 --> 26:14.772
had withdrawn into the shadows
once again, and I...

26:14.774 --> 26:17.508
I felt I had missed my chance.

26:17.510 --> 26:19.577
- But still...

26:19.579 --> 26:21.879
we've been in your basement,

26:21.881 --> 26:25.049
the weapons, your books...

26:25.051 --> 26:27.384
you've prepared.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.954
- I prepared, yes,

26:29.956 --> 26:32.456
but I had resigned myself

26:32.458 --> 26:34.592
to the reality that I would pass
from this world

26:34.594 --> 26:37.928
without ever facing him again.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.130
Seeing the Master

26:40.132 --> 26:42.633
in the tunnels
after all that time, I, uh...

26:42.635 --> 26:46.236
I lost perspective.
I realize that now.

26:46.238 --> 26:49.540
I reacted with
raging impulses, and anger,

26:49.542 --> 26:53.644
and emotion. I...

26:53.646 --> 26:55.646
I apologize.

26:55.648 --> 26:58.949
(siren blaring)
But...

27:00.886 --> 27:03.487
...I have rested
and I'm ready to...

27:03.489 --> 27:06.657
press ahead with the fight.

- My name is
Dr. Ephraim Goodweather.

29:34.573 --> 29:37.141
This is not a test.

29:37.143 --> 29:40.410
I'm an epidemiologist from
the Centers for Disease Control.

29:40.412 --> 29:43.113
I'm here to warn you
of an urgent danger.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.083
There is a disease spreading
through New York City

29:46.085 --> 29:48.085
and possibly beyond.

29:48.087 --> 29:51.255
This plague is responsible for
the mysterious disappearances

29:51.257 --> 29:54.792
we've been seeing.
These photographs show

29:54.794 --> 29:57.594
an autopsy I performed
on one of the victims.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.963
This strain,

29:59.965 --> 30:02.065
this virus changes

30:02.067 --> 30:04.301
its host body
through a violent,

30:04.303 --> 30:07.771
corruptive metamorphosis.
You can see a bizarre growth

30:07.773 --> 30:11.341
emanating from the throat
forming a kind of stinger

30:11.343 --> 30:15.312
through which a worm parasite
passes from the carrier

30:15.314 --> 30:17.648
to the victim. In fact,

30:17.650 --> 30:19.850
your loved ones,
once they are turned,

30:19.852 --> 30:22.586
once they are infected,
will come after you.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.189
Sunlight kills these--
- That's it.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.858
It's off. They stopped it.
- Woo!

30:27.860 --> 30:30.460

31:56.515 --> 31:58.582

34:10.315 --> 34:12.983
(pounding)

34:20.726 --> 34:22.526
- We need to go.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.861
- You're not thinking
of taking them on?

34:24.863 --> 34:27.664
- No, that will not work.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.766
I prepared for this,
there's another way out.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.202
Secret passage
through the meat locker.

34:32.204 --> 34:36.073
- That sounds better.
- I have to agree.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.275
Everybody, arm up.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.608
- There will be a time
for condolences,

35:11.610 --> 35:14.811
my dear, but...
now we must flee.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.980
- I can't leave her here.

35:18.584 --> 35:22.285
We could take her with us.

35:22.287 --> 35:25.422
Maybe there's a chance.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.657
- Go get Zack.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.726
I'll be right there.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.237
Go.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.612
Give it to me.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.681
Give it
to me.

35:59.124 --> 36:01.525
Go.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.495
Go.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.601
- Come on, let's go.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.871
Come on!

36:32.958 --> 36:36.026
- AAAAAH!

36:36.028 --> 36:38.128
(thump)

36:40.666 --> 36:42.899
(sobbing)

36:46.672 --> 36:48.772
(thunderclap)

36:51.510 --> 36:54.544
(door opening)

36:58.383 --> 37:00.450
(low growling)

37:02.688 --> 37:06.656
(aria in foreign language
sung by a woman)

37:20.906 --> 37:23.073
(screech)

37:24.876 --> 37:28.945
(aria continuing)

37:28.947 --> 37:32.182
(pounding)

37:54.806 --> 37:57.240
- It had to be done...

37:57.242 --> 37:59.976
for her.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.059
(aria continuing)
(thunder growling)

38:34.012 --> 38:36.646
(aria continuing)
(vampires growling and pounding)

38:44.756 --> 38:47.324
- 8230385!

38:49.661 --> 38:52.062
I know you can hear me.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.132
I am coming for you.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.101
(aria continuing)

39:12.984 --> 39:16.419
(in Romanian)

39:22.627 --> 39:26.896
(thunderclap)

40:05.103 --> 40:06.503
Ah.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.907
(heart beating)

40:31.596 --> 40:35.031
Goodbye, Miriam.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.367
Till we meet again.

41:16.575 --> 41:19.909
(translated from German)

41:27.652 --> 41:29.886
(siren in the distance)

41:31.523 --> 41:34.257
(gust of wind)

41:34.259 --> 41:36.526
- Fitzwilliam?

41:36.528 --> 41:40.230
Are you there?
(gust of wind)

41:46.972 --> 41:49.439
(gust of wind)

41:51.376 --> 41:53.843
(low growling)

41:57.349 --> 42:00.383
I knew you'd come.

42:00.385 --> 42:02.552
I believed.

42:05.957 --> 42:09.526
Save me.

42:09.528 --> 42:13.162
(low growling)

42:13.164 --> 42:16.199
- Behold.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.938
(Master growling)

42:37.155 --> 42:40.256
- Yes!

42:40.258 --> 42:42.992
Thank you.

42:47.198 --> 42:49.799
(sound of rain outside)

43:06.084 --> 43:09.786
(man laughing)

43:09.788 --> 43:11.955
(laughing)

43:29.107 --> 43:31.641
(still laughing)

43:38.249 --> 43:41.818
(theme music)
