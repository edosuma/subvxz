00:00.042 --> 00:02.144
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.169 --> 00:04.006
My name's Lucy. I'm your daughter.

00:04.030 --> 00:05.423
It's like your book.

00:05.448 --> 00:07.482
You just don't remember
because you're cursed.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.673
Lucy, it's not a curse!

00:08.775 --> 00:09.940
How do you know that?

00:10.043 --> 00:12.154
I know because I had a family, okay?

00:12.179 --> 00:13.044
And I lost them.

00:13.069 --> 00:15.597
Do the Prince and I
live happily ever after?

00:15.715 --> 00:17.676
There's usually a
complication before that.

00:19.552 --> 00:20.818
Thanks for the lesson.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.753
That girl killed the Prince!

00:22.855 --> 00:24.422
Take my bike and wait
for me where we first met.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.965
The portal to my land opens at midnight.

00:42.408 --> 00:43.607
Henry?

00:45.745 --> 00:46.911
Henry!

00:50.483 --> 00:51.615
Henry?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.684
Come with me now...

00:54.325 --> 00:55.953
murderer.

00:56.055 --> 00:58.255
No. It's a lie. I did nothing.

00:58.357 --> 01:00.624
Just what a murderer would say.

01:08.534 --> 01:09.433
I wouldn't...

01:12.440 --> 01:13.372
Hey, there.

01:20.613 --> 01:21.746
I'm Tiana.

01:23.983 --> 01:25.116
Cinderella.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.338
Morning, J.

01:49.681 --> 01:50.713
What is it?

01:54.849 --> 01:55.982
Is that from Lucy?

01:58.229 --> 01:59.761
Yeah.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.186
I miss her so much, my heart hurts.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.454
Ohh.

02:03.479 --> 02:06.736
Ever since Victoria took her
away, we've been writing letters

02:06.793 --> 02:10.127
and leaving them in the
well at the community garden

02:10.229 --> 02:12.063
so she won't know.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.532
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.639
That's Louie. I'm late for work.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.774
Look, I, uh... I got to go.

02:23.876 --> 02:25.810
But you... you hang in there.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.179
You are going to get
her back. I promise.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.313
I don't know.

02:29.415 --> 02:31.549
Maybe she's right.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.050
Maybe I am cursed.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.185
No, you're not.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.386
Come here.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.821
Come here.

02:42.729 --> 02:43.894
Come on in.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.930
Our one-handed detective
is already here.

02:48.968 --> 02:50.401
What's that?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.570
Wasn't sure what was appropriate
for a gathering like this,

02:52.672 --> 02:54.839
so I picked up some doughnuts.

02:54.907 --> 02:57.541
Right, 'cause the key to
bringing down Victoria Belfrey

02:57.643 --> 02:58.642
is a bear claw.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.044
Much appreciated, mate.

03:00.146 --> 03:02.380
And you'll excuse Roni...
she's a bit ornery.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.881
Yeah, well, you're
new around here, Henry,

03:03.950 --> 03:05.316
so soon, you'll be ornery, too.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.551
Just give it time.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.653
You brought us together because
you said you had something.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.288
Yes.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.877
Last night, I had a customer

03:13.902 --> 03:16.503
who works for the building commission.

03:16.605 --> 03:18.305
Got pretty drunk.

03:18.373 --> 03:20.474
Started spouting off about
how he was going to make

03:20.542 --> 03:23.276
some real money off Belfrey.

03:23.345 --> 03:25.011
She needed him to do her a favor.

03:25.114 --> 03:26.813
Heard him say that they
were meeting this afternoon

03:26.882 --> 03:30.417
in Hyperion Plaza, across
from Belfrey Towers.

03:30.486 --> 03:33.019
Bribes, public officials,
redeveloping the neighborhood

03:33.088 --> 03:35.288
at the expense of the
new guy... this is good.

03:35.357 --> 03:36.690
This is really good.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.260
I-I mean, it's... bad.

03:40.362 --> 03:41.728
It's bad.

03:41.830 --> 03:44.865
It's a good story. It's a bad... thing.

03:47.002 --> 03:47.901
Well said.

03:47.970 --> 03:48.759
Thank you.

03:48.784 --> 03:50.002
I'll go and stake it out.

03:50.027 --> 03:51.948
If I can get to the guy,
maybe I can get him to give us

03:52.040 --> 03:54.174
info on everything Belfrey
has her dirty little hands on.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.575
Like your missing-girl case?

03:55.677 --> 03:58.078
- Aye, luv.
- A stakeout, huh?

03:58.147 --> 03:59.746
That sounds... pretty cool.

03:59.815 --> 04:02.149
Always kind of wondered
what one of those was like.

04:02.251 --> 04:04.384
Mind if I, uh, tag along with you?

04:04.453 --> 04:06.353
Sorry, mate. I think I'll
be less conspicuous alone.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.221
Why don't you stick to your expertise

04:08.290 --> 04:11.458
and try and do a little research?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.593
Figure out who our target is.

04:13.662 --> 04:16.796
So, I'm research guy.

04:16.899 --> 04:17.797
Fun.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.887
Baby steps.

04:20.035 --> 04:23.203
I'll keep pouring drinks and
make to keep sure my ears open.

04:23.228 --> 04:25.228
Hey. Don't look so glum.

04:25.253 --> 04:27.820
You, uh, picked a hell of a bear claw.

04:47.462 --> 04:49.196
You really do believe me?

04:49.264 --> 04:52.349
Yeah. I know it was Lady
Tremaine who killed the Prince.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.343
How?

04:53.368 --> 04:56.336
Because I didn't come to the
ball to win the Prince's hand.

04:56.438 --> 04:58.171
I came to keep my eye on him.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.506
You're a spy?

04:59.575 --> 05:01.341
I'm the leader of the
resistance that was formed

05:01.410 --> 05:04.377
to overthrow your stepmother
and the royal family.

05:04.479 --> 05:07.214
Now?

05:07.282 --> 05:09.015
Where were you before?

05:09.084 --> 05:10.850
When the Prince killed my father?

05:10.919 --> 05:13.320
And when my stepmother locked
me away and made me serve her

05:13.422 --> 05:14.788
and her cruel family?

05:14.890 --> 05:16.122
Hmm?

05:16.191 --> 05:19.392
I am so sorry for everything
that has happened to you.

05:19.494 --> 05:21.861
But we are doing our best.

05:21.964 --> 05:25.198
And I assure you, we
can end all of this.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.366
I saw you with a sword.

05:26.468 --> 05:29.102
You could be a great asset to our cause.

05:29.171 --> 05:30.804
I'm not interested in your cause.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.474
The Prince didn't act alone
when he murdered your father.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.943
Your stepmother... she
planned the whole thing.

05:40.115 --> 05:42.682
I can see it in your
face. You know I'm right.

05:44.519 --> 05:46.286
What am I supposed to do?

05:46.355 --> 05:47.854
Come with me.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.522
We have a resistance camp nearby.

05:49.591 --> 05:51.424
Help us stop your stepmother.

05:51.493 --> 05:52.659
She took your home,

05:52.684 --> 05:54.417
and now she is going to
take all of our homes...

05:54.596 --> 05:56.329
The entire kingdom.

05:59.268 --> 06:01.768
Your father died standing up to her.

06:01.837 --> 06:03.703
Don't let that be in vain.

06:08.810 --> 06:09.876
Get on.

06:11.513 --> 06:13.480
- Come on!
- What is that?

06:13.582 --> 06:15.015
It's faster than any horse.

06:15.117 --> 06:16.549
That's all you need to know.

06:16.652 --> 06:18.485
Get on.

06:18.553 --> 06:19.586
Hold on tight.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.493
Your shoe.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.929
It's for a friend...
so he knows to find me.

06:38.373 --> 06:41.241
How sweet!

06:41.266 --> 06:42.509
I know about the letters,

06:42.611 --> 06:45.011
and I'm afraid Lucy's
not going to get that...

06:45.113 --> 06:47.380
Or anything else you leave
in that well, for that matter.

06:48.817 --> 06:51.584
What the hell are you doing here?

06:51.687 --> 06:54.254
I moved up my plans to build my condos.

06:54.356 --> 06:55.955
Demolition starts today.

06:56.058 --> 06:58.258
Victoria, you can't.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.727
If not for me, then for Lucy.

07:00.829 --> 07:03.430
Look at what she's done here.

07:03.532 --> 07:05.865
This garden means the world to her.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.567
It's already done.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.170
I have my permits right here.

07:10.272 --> 07:11.738
Now, unless you want
to be buried beneath it,

07:11.840 --> 07:13.873
I suggest you vacate the area.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.242
I'm gonna stop you.

07:16.345 --> 07:18.044
Start digging.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.758
Paperwork... hardest part of the job.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.155
Yeah, or the dullest.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.557
Here's something else that's dull.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.292
Tag this as evidence for me, will you?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.427
I'm afraid I can't.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.163
I've got something I
have to take care of.

07:45.231 --> 07:46.798
Oh, really?

07:46.900 --> 07:47.799
And what would that be?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.000
It's a court date...

07:49.068 --> 07:51.035
A parking ticket I wrote
up before my promotion.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.203
I'm actually running a bit late.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.471
Ah.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.608
Well, the wheels of justice
must keep turning, I suppose.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.577
Yeah. Look, I won't be long.

08:00.526 --> 08:02.157
Who am I to stand in their way?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.360
Oh. Hey, Jacinda. What can I do for you?

08:49.428 --> 08:50.761
I need help.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.329
The community garden's in trouble.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.665
If I had a nickel for every
customer who came in with that...

08:54.767 --> 08:55.799
I'm serious.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.268
I don't know how it's happening so fast,

08:57.370 --> 08:59.136
but Victoria's ripping it up right now,

08:59.205 --> 09:01.572
getting it ready for her stupid condos.

09:01.641 --> 09:04.642
Lucy loves that garden so
much. I can't let this happen.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.343
I guess we now know what that payout

09:06.412 --> 09:09.046
to the building commissioner was for.

09:09.115 --> 09:10.180
What payout?

09:12.018 --> 09:13.350
Henry?

09:13.452 --> 09:15.019
Hey.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.554
What are you doing here?

09:16.622 --> 09:19.156
Uh... helping.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.092
If she's paying people for permits,

09:22.194 --> 09:23.928
I say we beat her at her own game.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.967
"Hyperion Heights Building Codes."

09:30.036 --> 09:31.902
If you want a liquor
license in this neighborhood,

09:32.004 --> 09:34.872
you got to know a
lot... and I know a lot.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.508
Section 8, covering
neighborhood businesses...

09:37.577 --> 09:39.977
"An injunction can be
called on any demolition,

09:40.046 --> 09:42.947
so long as the community
deems the property

09:43.015 --> 09:45.316
essential to the public good."

09:45.384 --> 09:46.750
So, how do we do that?

09:46.819 --> 09:48.319
A petition.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.422
Get enough people to
sign, and Belfrey's done.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.657
Well, look who's a leader of the people.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.726
Yes. I'm a regular queen.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.572
We came to see how you
were getting settled.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.841
And to introduce you to someone.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.378
This is Jeremiah, one of the
truest believers in our cause.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.446
He made these for you.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.615
I was a cobbler in my old life.

10:17.717 --> 10:19.316
I hope they serve you well.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.752
Better to fight in than glass.

10:21.854 --> 10:22.920
Thank you.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.591
Okay. So, I got shoes and an army.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.194
When do we go up against my stepmother?

10:30.262 --> 10:32.529
That's actually the real
reason I came to find you.

10:32.598 --> 10:34.598
According to our scouts,
she's been transporting magic

10:34.700 --> 10:36.567
from the king's vault to her manor...

10:36.636 --> 10:38.268
Dark fairy dust, enchanted weapons.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.604
It's like she's
preparing to fight a war.

10:40.673 --> 10:43.874
And then, last night,
this was brought in.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.576
Everything else, we've
been able to identify,

10:45.645 --> 10:48.412
but this, we have no idea,
and that is what scares us.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.382
You lived with her. Do
you know what that is?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.319
- No.
- Well, it can't be good.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.454
By now, she's learned
there's a resistance.

10:57.523 --> 11:00.457
You want a fight? Don't
worry. It's coming.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.026
Maybe we can help.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.497
Henry.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.199
You look surprised to see me.
Didn't you want me to find you?

11:10.870 --> 11:12.536
And you said you don't believe in signs.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.441
Oh. Uh, there's someone
I want you to meet.

11:18.293 --> 11:19.993
This is my mother.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.746
Regina.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.916
It's, uh, nice to finally meet you.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.251
It would have happened sooner,

11:27.319 --> 11:28.852
but I had a few kinks
in my locator spell

11:28.954 --> 11:30.721
I needed to work through, so...

11:30.790 --> 11:32.122
Well, I'm glad you did.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.660
And, uh, if this is your mother,

11:36.729 --> 11:39.329
don't tell me... this is your father?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.498
Well, not quite.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.268
Captain Hook, at your service.

11:44.293 --> 11:46.070
It's a pleasure. This is Tiana.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.939
Is it true you have magic?

11:49.008 --> 11:52.443
You could help us defeat Lady Tremaine?

11:52.511 --> 11:54.678
I know my way around a spell.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.614
Then maybe we do have a chance.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.018
You're really here to help?

12:01.087 --> 12:02.186
Whatever you need.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.567
There you are.

12:16.635 --> 12:18.635
And here you are...

12:18.704 --> 12:19.903
in a bar.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.372
Have you seen this?

12:22.475 --> 12:23.707
It's part of a petition.

12:23.732 --> 12:26.076
She's gotten 100 signatures already.

12:26.178 --> 12:27.377
And you're helping.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.713
I knew you'd be back... For my mom.

12:29.782 --> 12:32.349
Listen, Lucy, I'm not
here about her, okay?

12:32.418 --> 12:33.851
Well, yeah, I guess I am right now.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.686
But just to help her
stop your step-grandmother

12:35.788 --> 12:37.087
from destroying the garden.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.224
I get it.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.391
It's the truth.

12:41.460 --> 12:42.993
No, I know.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.862
You seem awful chipper,
considering what's happening.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.930
I figured, after all the work
you put in to save the place,

12:46.999 --> 12:48.932
you'd be a little more upset.

12:49.001 --> 12:51.435
Why would I be, when
it's making my mom fight?

12:51.504 --> 12:54.071
Don't you get it? She's
starting to wake up.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.305
It's happening.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.443
Can I tell you a secret?

12:59.545 --> 13:00.511
Yeah.

13:00.579 --> 13:03.747
This isn't really about the condos.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.015
It's not?

13:05.117 --> 13:07.451
It's about what's below the surface.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.187
What? You think there's
something buried down there?

13:10.289 --> 13:12.523
There's only one way to find out.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.527
It's just like when you led Archie

13:16.595 --> 13:18.662
into the Storybrooke mines, remember?

13:18.731 --> 13:20.030
And the Evil Queen had to stop you

13:20.132 --> 13:21.698
before you discovered
Snow White's coffin

13:21.801 --> 13:22.900
was hidden down there?

13:23.002 --> 13:24.668
You mean in the book I made up.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.203
Whatever.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.505
The point is, I bet
there's something magical

13:28.607 --> 13:29.673
under the garden...

13:29.775 --> 13:31.642
Something my grandmother
wants to get her hands on

13:31.744 --> 13:33.110
before we do.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.212
Honestly? One storyteller to another,

13:35.314 --> 13:36.446
it just seems a little, uh...

13:37.950 --> 13:39.650
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:39.752 --> 13:41.285
Stop digging! We hit something!

13:45.558 --> 13:46.723
What the hell?

13:48.761 --> 13:51.528
Grab the caution tape
and cordon off the area.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.230
Call Belfrey!

13:53.299 --> 13:54.932
Told ya.

13:55.034 --> 13:55.933
Hey!

14:02.074 --> 14:04.374
Hey, this doesn't prove anything.

14:04.476 --> 14:05.531
I know.

14:05.556 --> 14:08.591
But if I get my hands on
whatever's down there, it will.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.981
Hey, Lucy! Lucy!

14:11.083 --> 14:11.982
Lucy!

14:21.819 --> 14:22.918
Michael Griffith?

14:25.155 --> 14:26.188
Yeah.

14:28.559 --> 14:30.292
How do you know who I am?

14:30.361 --> 14:31.860
I've been trying to track you all day.

14:31.962 --> 14:33.662
Name's Detective Rogers.

14:33.731 --> 14:34.896
Oh, okay.

14:34.998 --> 14:37.232
Good for you.

14:37.301 --> 14:38.600
I'd like you to answer some questions

14:38.669 --> 14:40.035
about Victoria Belfrey.

14:40.104 --> 14:43.138
Mm. I don't know anything about her.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.373
Yeah.

14:47.511 --> 14:53.181
The bulge in your jacket
pocket would suggest otherwise.

14:54.651 --> 14:56.718
Hey.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.253
You don't want to do this.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.721
I assure you, I do.

15:04.561 --> 15:06.328
So...

15:06.397 --> 15:10.465
how about you keep half of
that, and I finish my empanada?

15:10.567 --> 15:11.800
You're coming with me.

15:16.874 --> 15:17.839
Lucy!

15:17.941 --> 15:20.041
Hey! What the hell are you thinking?

15:20.144 --> 15:21.610
This tunnel could collapse.

15:21.678 --> 15:23.545
Nah. It seems to have held up this long.

15:23.647 --> 15:24.813
Now, come on and help.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.281
Grandma's definitely got something

15:26.350 --> 15:27.338
hidden down here somewhere.

15:27.363 --> 15:29.996
Lucy, I know this all
seems a little... magical,

15:30.021 --> 15:30.863
but it's not.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.021
They just built part of the
new city over the old city.

15:33.123 --> 15:34.756
Yeah, I know about the
Seattle Underground,

15:34.858 --> 15:36.525
but that doesn't mean something magical

15:36.627 --> 15:38.627
can't be buried down here.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.328
You know what? I don't get it.

15:40.431 --> 15:43.064
Why is it so hard for
you to believe the truth?

15:43.133 --> 15:45.400
That me and my mom are your real family?

15:45.469 --> 15:46.735
Because it's crazy.

15:46.804 --> 15:48.103
Is it?

15:48.172 --> 15:49.905
Then tell me what happened
when you went to the cemetery

15:49.973 --> 15:52.441
where you said your wife
and daughter were buried...

15:52.543 --> 15:54.209
The cemetery you said you never went to.

15:54.278 --> 15:56.611
Well, I bet you did after we met.

15:56.713 --> 15:58.519
So, what did you find?

16:00.484 --> 16:02.417
They weren't there.
Neither was the cemetery.

16:02.486 --> 16:05.220
- It was like...
- Like it never existed? Yeah.

16:05.289 --> 16:07.355
Because it didn't.

16:07.424 --> 16:11.460
All the memories of
your family are fake.

16:11.528 --> 16:15.297
It's just the curse.
They didn't really die.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.731
Maybe they moved the cemetery.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.634
Or I could've had the
wrong address all along.

16:19.703 --> 16:21.570
There is definitely a
rational explanation,

16:21.672 --> 16:22.737
and I am gonna find them. I...

16:22.806 --> 16:24.506
No, you won't, because
you're fooling yourself.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.274
Your family isn't buried anywhere

16:26.376 --> 16:28.443
because they're not dead.

16:28.545 --> 16:29.478
That's the curse.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.246
We're right here.

16:31.348 --> 16:33.348
You just have to be willing to believe.

16:36.119 --> 16:37.319
Lucy.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.721
Thanks so much for all your support.

16:39.823 --> 16:41.957
The gardens and I thank you.

16:43.894 --> 16:45.694
Oh, yes.

16:45.762 --> 16:46.928
Thank you.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.668
Thank you so much. Thank you.

16:53.770 --> 16:54.936
Please.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.441
This will work.

16:59.543 --> 17:00.775
We won't have to breach
their perimeter alone.

17:00.878 --> 17:02.377
We'll have two sets of resistance guards

17:02.479 --> 17:04.880
on either flank to occupy the guards.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.248
I'll be heading up one group.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.382
I'll head up the other.

17:07.483 --> 17:08.415
I'll go with you.

17:08.484 --> 17:11.086
I'll join you, if you'll have me.

17:11.188 --> 17:14.556
I guess we can use all
the help we can muster.

17:14.625 --> 17:17.392
All right, everyone, rest up.

17:17.461 --> 17:18.993
We'll head out in the morning.

17:25.269 --> 17:26.434
Hey.

17:26.537 --> 17:29.070
You don't have to worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

17:29.139 --> 17:31.806
Me and my family, we take
down bad guys all the time.

17:31.909 --> 17:34.175
I can tell.

17:34.278 --> 17:35.443
Is something wrong?

17:37.281 --> 17:40.815
We have a big day tomorrow.
We need to get some rest.

17:40.884 --> 17:43.051
Yeah, sure.

17:43.153 --> 17:44.252
Have a good night.

18:09.279 --> 18:11.613
Sorry, but it looks
like this is it, kid.

18:11.682 --> 18:12.681
No.

18:12.783 --> 18:14.549
There's no way she's
digging up that garden

18:14.651 --> 18:16.217
just to put in condos.

18:16.286 --> 18:18.153
There has be something here!

18:18.221 --> 18:20.155
Oh, come on, Lucy.
It's getting late, okay?

18:20.223 --> 18:21.423
And if she finds you down here with me,

18:21.525 --> 18:22.524
you're going to boarding school

18:22.593 --> 18:23.892
and I'm going somewhere
a whole lot worse.

18:23.994 --> 18:25.160
- Come on.
- I don't care.

18:25.228 --> 18:26.761
We have to keep looking!

18:26.863 --> 18:28.096
Lucy, please.

18:28.165 --> 18:30.532
Can we just... this
is dangerous down here.

18:30.601 --> 18:33.068
We're just not seeing it.

18:33.136 --> 18:35.036
Maybe we have to look closer.

18:35.138 --> 18:37.272
Look closer at what?
There's nothing here.

18:44.548 --> 18:45.981
Yes!

18:46.083 --> 18:47.916
There is! I knew it!

18:47.985 --> 18:48.883
Look!

18:48.986 --> 18:50.285
What...

18:54.301 --> 18:55.490
It's a piece of glass.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.392
Not just any piece of glass.

18:57.494 --> 19:00.562
It's from my mom's slipper,
when she was Cinderella.

19:00.664 --> 19:02.897
It must have come
through during the curse.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.833
Even if I believed
that... which I don't...

19:04.935 --> 19:06.134
Why would Belfrey go through all this

19:06.236 --> 19:07.902
just to find a broken piece of shoe?

19:08.005 --> 19:09.237
Don't you see?

19:09.339 --> 19:10.705
This proves everything...

19:10.807 --> 19:14.142
Who my mother really
is, the curse, all of it.

19:14.244 --> 19:15.577
Lucy, listen to me.

19:15.679 --> 19:17.646
I literally wrote the
book on fairy tales.

19:17.748 --> 19:18.980
And I'm so glad that you
enjoyed it, but this is not...

19:19.082 --> 19:22.150
If you don't believe
me, maybe my mom will.

19:22.252 --> 19:23.451
I have to show this to her.

19:23.553 --> 19:26.655
Then maybe she'll finally
remember who she is...

19:26.757 --> 19:27.989
Cinderella.

19:56.039 --> 19:58.782
I thought that would lure you in.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.467
Why is this here?

20:03.536 --> 20:08.973
Yes, I suppose it's time
we had a proper talk.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.841
Yeah, it sure is.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.309
Let's start with the coffin.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.013
Or what you did to my father.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.450
So, you've learned the truth.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.451
Why?

20:20.519 --> 20:22.386
Oh, you know exactly why.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.390
So, this is because of me?

20:28.628 --> 20:31.095
Will there never be a time
where I've suffered enough

20:31.197 --> 20:33.931
for what I did?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.265
No.

20:35.368 --> 20:39.203
Well, if you want to
punish me, get it over with.

20:39.482 --> 20:40.970
Leave the others out of this.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.440
Kill me now.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.343
Oh, I'll get to that.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.780
But I still need something from you.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.043
Shall we take a look?

20:55.146 --> 20:56.211
No.

20:57.982 --> 20:59.114
Please.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.185
Look at her.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.594
Anastasia?

21:12.663 --> 21:14.163
I don't understand She's...

21:14.231 --> 21:15.464
Perfectly preserved.

21:17.301 --> 21:18.834
There's one tiny breath left

21:18.903 --> 21:21.537
inside this precious little body.

21:21.605 --> 21:25.140
And I've saved it...
Until I could save her.

21:25.209 --> 21:27.743
How?

21:27.812 --> 21:30.746
How did you do this?

21:30.848 --> 21:34.183
You're not the only one
with magical friends.

21:36.187 --> 21:41.156
Anastasia was an innocent,
with the purest of hearts.

21:41.225 --> 21:46.028
The only way to bring her back
is with an equally pure heart.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.146
Henry?

21:47.171 --> 21:52.801
I did a little digging,
and I discovered who he was.

21:52.870 --> 21:55.727
Ana died. It was terrible.

21:55.752 --> 21:56.939
But killing another innocent...

21:57.041 --> 21:58.841
Is the only way to bring her back.

21:58.943 --> 21:59.737
It's wrong!

21:59.762 --> 22:01.128
I don't care.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.546
You'll never get his heart.

22:04.648 --> 22:07.015
Yes, I will.

22:07.084 --> 22:08.750
Because you're going to get it for me.

22:13.591 --> 22:15.757
Because if you don't,

22:15.826 --> 22:20.662
every person in that little
resistance you've joined

22:20.764 --> 22:22.130
will pay the price.

22:25.769 --> 22:28.570
It's your choice, Cinderella.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.974
Either you sacrifice that boy...

22:31.999 --> 22:33.956
or you sacrifice everyone.

22:38.115 --> 22:39.615
Thank you so much.

22:39.717 --> 22:41.250
Thank you.

22:46.090 --> 22:48.857
Oh! A petition.

22:48.959 --> 22:50.425
How quaint.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.061
Sneer all you want. It's working.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.396
Is it?

22:54.498 --> 22:58.467
Well, that doesn't matter,
since you're about to stop.

23:05.242 --> 23:07.175
A brochure of your crappy condos?

23:07.244 --> 23:08.744
Why would I care about that?

23:08.812 --> 23:11.480
What if one of these
crappy condos were yours?

23:11.582 --> 23:13.916
And Lucy's, of course.

23:13.984 --> 23:15.517
You're just gonna give it to me?

23:15.586 --> 23:16.919
Why not?

23:17.021 --> 23:19.154
All this fighting isn't
getting us anywhere.

23:19.256 --> 23:21.957
This way, everyone wins.

23:22.059 --> 23:23.725
Especially you.

23:23.827 --> 23:26.428
Think of the life you
can give her, Jacinda.

23:26.497 --> 23:29.865
I'm tired of being the bad guy,
and this is a peace offering.

23:29.934 --> 23:34.436
All you have to do is one small thing.

23:36.006 --> 23:37.205
Burn the petition.

23:40.444 --> 23:41.610
For Lucy.

24:26.056 --> 24:27.122
Mom?

24:30.728 --> 24:33.128
Lucy, what are you doing here?

24:33.197 --> 24:34.763
Mom, why would you do this?

24:34.865 --> 24:37.232
Lucy, I know this is hard
for you to understand,

24:37.334 --> 24:39.101
but I did it for us.

24:39.169 --> 24:40.302
No.

24:40.327 --> 24:42.137
No, a hero does the right thing.

24:42.206 --> 24:45.407
I'm not a hero. I am just your mother.

24:45.509 --> 24:47.943
And this is the right
thing for us, Lucy.

24:49.513 --> 24:52.414
We need to be together,
and I don't care how.

24:52.516 --> 24:54.516
I do.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.652
If this is what it takes...

24:57.755 --> 24:59.788
I don't want to be together.

25:23.747 --> 25:24.913
What the hell are you doing?

25:25.015 --> 25:27.382
Well, I should ask you the same.

25:27.484 --> 25:28.450
What is this?

25:28.519 --> 25:31.186
Extracurricular work, is it?

25:31.255 --> 25:33.822
I'm doing my job. That man's a criminal.

25:33.924 --> 25:35.257
Yeah.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.792
And you're a liar.

25:36.894 --> 25:38.794
Court date? Parking ticket?

25:38.896 --> 25:41.329
You opened up a case unofficially.

25:41.432 --> 25:42.931
Why are you so interested in him?

25:43.033 --> 25:46.701
What does it matter? He's a bad guy.

25:46.804 --> 25:50.005
It matters because he
works for Victoria Belfrey,

25:50.107 --> 25:53.608
and dealing with her
requires a bit of finesse.

25:53.710 --> 25:55.610
Finesse?

25:55.712 --> 25:57.946
So, we're just supposed to let
some lowlife walk the streets?

25:58.048 --> 25:59.281
Sometimes, yes.

25:59.383 --> 26:02.851
Because now, when she makes
a call to that lowlife,

26:02.953 --> 26:05.420
he makes one to me.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.456
Enjoy the rest of your day off.

27:01.970 --> 27:03.002
I'm sorry.

27:04.439 --> 27:05.871
You don't want to do that.

27:10.612 --> 27:13.145
I saw you sneak off. Pretty
sure I know where you went.

27:13.248 --> 27:16.716
Please. You have to let me do this.

27:16.784 --> 27:19.418
Look, whatever Tremaine wants,
we can find a way to stop her.

27:19.487 --> 27:21.020
She wants Henry.

27:23.458 --> 27:26.058
The Heart of the Truest Believer.

27:26.127 --> 27:28.561
But I couldn't.

27:28.663 --> 27:31.564
I just couldn't do it.

27:31.633 --> 27:34.567
This man...

27:34.636 --> 27:37.036
he believes.

27:37.138 --> 27:41.941
Tiana said that he'd give
up his life for the cause.

27:42.010 --> 27:46.712
And if that would save everyone
else, then... isn't that okay?

27:49.651 --> 27:53.653
You know, it took me
a long time to learn...

27:53.755 --> 27:55.321
but no.

27:55.390 --> 27:56.322
It's not.

28:02.430 --> 28:05.931
That kind of sacrifice is never okay.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.136
What the hell is this about, anyway?

28:14.742 --> 28:17.143
I'm sorry.

28:17.245 --> 28:18.177
I can't.

28:28.623 --> 28:31.223
You all right?

28:31.326 --> 28:33.626
No.

28:33.728 --> 28:34.960
Not even close.

28:37.598 --> 28:38.664
Let me guess.

28:40.335 --> 28:42.501
Victoria showed up and made you an offer

28:42.603 --> 28:43.803
you couldn't refuse.

28:43.905 --> 28:44.937
How did you know?

28:46.226 --> 28:48.407
I've seen her M.O.

28:48.476 --> 28:51.844
Yeah, well... so did Lucy.

28:51.913 --> 28:53.579
She saw the whole thing.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.817
I'm so sorry.

28:57.919 --> 29:00.586
She has this idea that I'm some hero

29:00.688 --> 29:04.090
that always does the right thing.

29:04.158 --> 29:07.460
But I'm not, you know?

29:07.528 --> 29:10.096
I'm just human.

29:10.198 --> 29:12.031
And I just want my kid back.

29:14.168 --> 29:15.668
How can that be wrong?

29:15.770 --> 29:16.869
It's not.

29:19.006 --> 29:23.309
But this isn't about Lucy.

29:23.411 --> 29:24.677
It never has been.

29:26.714 --> 29:29.715
It's about you.

29:29.817 --> 29:34.019
And you have to ask yourself, Jacinda...

29:34.122 --> 29:37.189
what are you honestly
willing to give up?

29:37.291 --> 29:39.425
'Cause the Victoria
Belfreys of the world...

29:42.063 --> 29:45.631
they will take everything
you have if you let them.

29:51.506 --> 29:53.072
Hey!

29:53.174 --> 29:54.974
I've been looking for you everywhere.

29:56.878 --> 29:57.877
What happened?

29:57.979 --> 29:59.512
I don't want to talk about it.

29:59.614 --> 30:01.480
Okay.

30:05.787 --> 30:08.454
Hey, what's going on over there?

30:08.556 --> 30:10.055
I don't know.

30:13.394 --> 30:15.494
Thank you all for coming.

30:17.632 --> 30:20.466
I know some of you have
already signed this once today

30:20.568 --> 30:22.868
and are probably wondering
what this is all about.

30:24.939 --> 30:27.039
Well, I need you to sign it again.

30:28.342 --> 30:29.608
I'm sorry.

30:31.379 --> 30:32.812
I let you all down.

30:35.049 --> 30:36.449
I let myself down.

30:38.686 --> 30:42.555
And I put this defenseless
little garden at risk,

30:42.657 --> 30:45.124
when I should have protected it.

30:45.226 --> 30:49.161
You see, this garden isn't
what it was supposed to be.

30:49.230 --> 30:52.131
I couldn't see that.

30:52.233 --> 30:53.966
But my Lucy did.

30:55.770 --> 30:59.371
She never stopped believing
in it for a second.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.273
We're gonna show Victoria Belfrey

31:01.375 --> 31:07.546
that when you truly
believe in something...

31:07.648 --> 31:10.182
you can change things.

31:10.284 --> 31:14.820
So, if you're willing to
fight with me, sign this.

31:14.889 --> 31:18.657
And when you're done, start planting.

31:18.759 --> 31:20.493
We're gonna show Victoria Belfrey

31:20.518 --> 31:25.030
that we're not just gonna stop
her from destroying this garden.

31:25.132 --> 31:28.801
We're gonna make some
something wonderful here...

31:28.903 --> 31:30.469
Together.

31:47.197 --> 31:48.730
Going somewhere?

31:48.832 --> 31:51.532
After what I almost
did, I shouldn't be here.

31:51.635 --> 31:53.167
Well, that's not true.

31:53.269 --> 31:57.005
I'm not saying it was the
smartest decision, but...

31:57.073 --> 31:58.706
hell, I've done a lot worse.

31:58.775 --> 32:00.608
You'd be surprised
what people can forgive.

32:00.644 --> 32:05.680
Well, it's not safe for anyone
to be around me anyway, so...

32:05.782 --> 32:07.248
Especially you and Henry.

32:07.317 --> 32:10.518
You should both go back to
your home, where he's safe.

32:10.587 --> 32:14.022
It was... silly of him
to have stuck around here.

32:14.124 --> 32:15.723
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

32:24.267 --> 32:28.770
My stepsister Anastasia died
when she was 14 years old.

32:30.540 --> 32:32.874
I'm so sorry.

32:32.976 --> 32:37.011
Lady Tremaine blamed my father...

32:37.113 --> 32:38.613
but it was because of me.

32:41.117 --> 32:44.519
And now Lady Tremaine
wants to bring her back?

32:44.587 --> 32:45.853
Raising the dead.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.388
She won't stop until she gets it.

32:47.457 --> 32:49.490
She doesn't care how many
people she hurts along the way.

32:49.592 --> 32:51.459
Running away isn't the answer.

32:51.528 --> 32:52.860
Maybe.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.897
Or maybe chasing me will keep
her away from other people.

32:55.999 --> 32:58.599
Ohhh.

32:58.668 --> 33:00.201
Now it all makes sense.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.671
You stayed in that
depressing manor home.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.940
You let your stepmother
walk all over you

33:06.042 --> 33:12.714
and call you "Cinder... ella."

33:12.816 --> 33:14.949
But, you know, there's
a reason for that.

33:15.051 --> 33:18.186
You're punishing yourself.

33:18.254 --> 33:20.855
Take my advice.

33:20.924 --> 33:23.624
If you want to take this woman down,

33:23.693 --> 33:27.061
the first thing you got to do...

33:27.130 --> 33:30.598
is forgive yourself.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.834
And I'm not talking about
what happened tonight.

33:32.902 --> 33:36.437
I'm talking about whatever
happened with your stepsister.

33:38.208 --> 33:39.607
Whatever you decide to do,

33:39.676 --> 33:44.312
you make sure it's your wish...

33:44.380 --> 33:45.980
not someone else's.

33:59.629 --> 34:01.596
We should make a move soon.

34:01.664 --> 34:03.598
Well, my hook is
sharpened and at the ready.

34:03.700 --> 34:04.832
Where's Cinderella?

34:04.901 --> 34:07.268
About that, Henry...

34:11.040 --> 34:13.674
I was, um, just packing up.

34:13.777 --> 34:15.376
And, uh...

34:15.478 --> 34:17.043
it's just "Ella" now.

34:17.112 --> 34:18.746
Ella, huh?

34:18.815 --> 34:20.114
I like it.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.917
And we can't storm
Lady Tremaine's manor.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.185
It's a trap.

34:24.286 --> 34:25.418
How can you be sure?

34:28.391 --> 34:32.193
Well, because I used my
magic mirror and saw inside.

34:32.262 --> 34:33.293
She's waiting for us.

34:37.801 --> 34:40.234
Okay, then. Let's pack up.

34:44.641 --> 34:45.806
Is everything okay?

34:47.443 --> 34:49.310
It'll be good we have some time to talk.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.949
Oh, man.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.185
Mmm.

34:58.822 --> 35:01.389
Well, I should probably get going.

35:01.457 --> 35:03.257
I've got a lot of writing to do.

35:03.326 --> 35:05.960
Right... your story about the garden.

35:08.164 --> 35:09.730
Seems like you got a pretty good start.

35:09.833 --> 35:12.967
Yeah, I think so.

35:13.036 --> 35:15.803
And hey, maybe I could run
it by you when I'm done.

35:15.872 --> 35:18.472
Hmm? Something tells me
you've got lots of ideas.

35:18.575 --> 35:19.607
Sure.

35:22.445 --> 35:25.513
So, I guess I'll, uh... see you around.

35:30.887 --> 35:32.320
Hey!

35:32.388 --> 35:33.788
I have something for you.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.627
I thought you were gonna
give this to your mom.

35:39.696 --> 35:42.930
I was going to, but... she
doesn't need it anymore.

35:42.999 --> 35:45.666
She's already becoming the
hero she's supposed to be.

35:45.735 --> 35:48.669
And in the story, it's the
prince that keeps the slipper...

35:48.738 --> 35:50.838
So he could always find his true love,

35:50.940 --> 35:52.640
even when he thinks she's lost forever.

35:52.709 --> 35:54.842
Lucy, let's not go down this path again.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.377
We won't.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.647
Because I know the
family you're looking for,

35:59.749 --> 36:02.550
you're not gonna find
them in some cemetery.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.485
We're right in front of you.

36:04.587 --> 36:07.755
And I know you feel it now.

36:07.824 --> 36:09.957
All you have to do is believe.

36:10.059 --> 36:11.425
And you're getting there.

37:27.808 --> 37:30.972
_

38:02.839 --> 38:05.172
Thank you, gentlemen. Good work.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.109
I'll take it from here.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.177
Come into the light
so that I can see you.

38:55.858 --> 38:59.360
I said, "Come into the light."

38:59.429 --> 39:01.495
It's been a long time
since you visited me

39:01.597 --> 39:03.631
in the tip top of your tower.

39:06.135 --> 39:09.170
What's the matter? Plans gone awry?

39:09.272 --> 39:11.072
Quite the contrary.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.874
I did some digging today.

39:13.943 --> 39:15.643
Cinderella and her
friends tried to stop me,

39:15.711 --> 39:19.280
but once they succeeded,
it was too late.

39:19.382 --> 39:22.116
And what makes you think I'd
be interested in some thing

39:22.218 --> 39:24.251
that you dug up out of the ground?

39:24.353 --> 39:28.289
Because I didn't dig up some thing.

39:28.391 --> 39:30.291
I dug up someone.

39:35.665 --> 39:38.499
My darling, sweet girl.

39:39.902 --> 39:42.303
You found her.

39:42.405 --> 39:44.238
Yes.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.274
And now you can finally help...

39:47.376 --> 39:49.677
bring her back.

39:49.745 --> 39:52.613
And are you ready for what that means?

39:55.418 --> 39:57.918
Nothing frightens me.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.420
Oh, but it should.

40:01.624 --> 40:03.858
It most certainly should.

40:07.430 --> 40:09.130
And the boy believes?

40:10.666 --> 40:11.966
No.

40:12.068 --> 40:14.001
But his daughter, Lucy...

40:14.103 --> 40:16.370
Her heart's protected, too.

40:16.472 --> 40:19.106
I don't need to steal her heart.

40:19.175 --> 40:21.976
She needs to surrender
her belief... willingly.

40:22.078 --> 40:26.714
Yes, yes, by destroying
everything she cares about.

40:27.783 --> 40:30.651
And now you want my help.

40:30.753 --> 40:33.521
Alas, I'm afraid you're on your own.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.895
Don't you forget...

40:40.997 --> 40:42.429
you're my prisoner.

40:42.532 --> 40:43.764
Really?

40:43.866 --> 40:45.199
Because the way I see it is that

40:45.301 --> 40:47.768
we're both shackled in our own way.

40:47.870 --> 40:52.106
And the question is, who
is the actual prisoner...

40:52.175 --> 40:53.607
and to whom?

40:55.044 --> 40:58.879
This was... a courtesy...

40:58.981 --> 41:01.815
a peace offering.

41:01.918 --> 41:05.019
Consider it rescinded.

41:05.121 --> 41:07.421
You may destroy the girl.

41:07.523 --> 41:11.091
You may take everything she cares about.

41:11.194 --> 41:14.195
You may get your daughter back.

41:14.297 --> 41:15.696
But...

41:17.767 --> 41:20.000
then you'll have to deal with me.
