02:17.308 --> 02:22.441
with a combined weight of 745 pounds...

02:22.482 --> 02:25.821
the toasts of the coasts...

02:25.862 --> 02:28.909
from Brad Street, U.S.A.,
Atlanta, Georgia...

02:28.992 --> 02:32.456
the Fabulous Freebirds!

02:32.497 --> 02:33.707
Yeah!

03:40.141 --> 03:42.937
You gotta love it!

04:05.888 --> 04:07.933
Kill him!
Stomp on the son of--

04:30.341 --> 04:32.511
Hey! Where you going?

05:38.110 --> 05:39.153
Macleod.

05:44.620 --> 05:47.583
Fasil. Wait.

06:04.608 --> 06:05.652
Aah!

06:08.072 --> 06:09.658
All right.

06:20.048 --> 06:21.133
Aah!

06:46.254 --> 06:47.464
Aah!

06:58.523 --> 06:59.900
Ah ha ha!

07:11.459 --> 07:13.045
Aah!

07:40.586 --> 07:41.629
Aah!

08:31.580 --> 08:32.873
Ahh.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.125
Ow.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.212
Aah!

09:35.801 --> 09:37.762
- Oh!

09:37.846 --> 09:38.931
Oh!

09:41.101 --> 09:42.269
Oh!

09:56.958 --> 09:59.253
Aah!

10:18.532 --> 10:20.410
Aah!

10:20.493 --> 10:22.455
Ohh...

11:15.243 --> 11:17.204
Macleod!

11:19.165 --> 11:21.210
Clan Macleod!

11:31.767 --> 11:35.690
May this year
of our Lord 1536...

11:35.773 --> 11:39.237
bring victory
to the Clan Macleod!

11:39.320 --> 11:40.698
Macleod!

11:40.781 --> 11:43.869
Victory to Macleod!

11:50.087 --> 11:52.841
Hurry up! Hurry up!

11:55.720 --> 11:58.140
Are you scared, Connor?

11:58.224 --> 11:59.726
Ha ha ha!

11:59.810 --> 12:02.439
No, Cousin Dugal.
I'm not!

12:02.522 --> 12:04.400
Don't talk nonsense, man.

12:04.483 --> 12:08.656
I peed my kilt the first time
I went into battle.

12:08.740 --> 12:10.033
Oh, aye.

12:10.117 --> 12:12.412
Angus pees his kilt
all the time!

12:34.946 --> 12:36.156
Connor!

12:37.032 --> 12:38.535
Connor, wait!

12:38.576 --> 12:40.705
Wait!

12:40.746 --> 12:44.168
Take these flowers
and think of me.

12:46.088 --> 12:49.802
Remember, you fight with God
on your side, Connor.

12:49.885 --> 12:52.013
A girl like that
can wound a soldier...

12:52.097 --> 12:54.058
more than a Frazer sword,
my friend.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.854
Angus! You and Dugal
keep him in one piece!

12:56.937 --> 12:59.650
Aye, we all know
what piece that is!

13:42.840 --> 13:46.470
There is one called Connor
among them.

13:46.554 --> 13:47.889
Aye.

13:53.481 --> 13:55.484
Remember our
agreement, Murdoch.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.365
The boy is mine.

13:59.448 --> 14:01.368
It's begun.

14:01.451 --> 14:04.414
Death to the Macleods!

14:04.497 --> 14:07.418
Death to the Macleods!

14:07.502 --> 14:10.548
Yay! Yay!

14:16.182 --> 14:18.059
Death to the Frazers!

14:18.101 --> 14:20.188
Yay! Yah!

14:33.875 --> 14:35.127
Unh!

14:40.093 --> 14:41.887
Macleod!

14:46.143 --> 14:47.813
Aah!

14:57.577 --> 14:58.954
Come on!

14:58.996 --> 15:00.832
Macleod!

15:05.297 --> 15:06.883
Now you stay under.

15:08.427 --> 15:11.932
- Forgive me... my son.
- Aah!

15:13.434 --> 15:15.437
Fight me, damn you!

15:15.521 --> 15:17.107
Fight me, cowards!

15:17.190 --> 15:18.776
No, not him!

15:26.871 --> 15:28.457
Castrate the heathens!

15:28.541 --> 15:30.710
Nobody will fight me!

15:30.794 --> 15:33.298
They all run away.

15:33.381 --> 15:36.803
Here, laddie, stay by me.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.982
Mother of God.

15:50.031 --> 15:51.492
Fight me!

15:51.533 --> 15:52.744
Unnhhrr!

15:52.827 --> 15:54.413
Ooh!

15:58.252 --> 16:01.006
Aah!

16:01.048 --> 16:02.467
Unh!

16:04.929 --> 16:07.140
No!

16:07.224 --> 16:09.477
Come on, quick!

16:09.561 --> 16:11.397
There can be only one!

16:11.438 --> 16:13.525
Unh!

16:14.526 --> 16:16.529
Another time, Macleod!

16:50.706 --> 16:53.084
Get out of the car!

16:53.126 --> 16:56.590
Put your hands
on the hood!

16:56.673 --> 16:58.676
Move!

16:58.760 --> 17:00.930
Okay!

17:02.390 --> 17:04.351
Watch it, freak!
Just cool it!

17:04.435 --> 17:05.936
Watch him!
Watch him!

17:05.979 --> 17:09.483
Move! Come on!
Come on! Move!

17:09.568 --> 17:11.612
Come on!
Get up there!

17:11.654 --> 17:13.323
Aah!

17:13.365 --> 17:14.826
Spread 'em!
Spread 'em!

17:14.909 --> 17:17.121
- Come on!

17:17.204 --> 17:20.000
Let's see
some l.D., pal.

17:21.544 --> 17:23.255
Well, Mr. Nash.

17:23.338 --> 17:27.595
Where were you going
in such a hurry?

17:27.678 --> 17:31.559
Give me it!
Give me it!

17:31.642 --> 17:32.686
Ooh!

17:37.526 --> 17:40.447
Don't move, pal.

17:40.531 --> 17:42.617
Don't even breathe!

18:23.095 --> 18:27.143
In nomine patri et filii
et spiritu sancti.

18:27.226 --> 18:28.603
Amen.

18:30.523 --> 18:32.484
It is over.

18:32.526 --> 18:33.986
No!

18:34.070 --> 18:36.615
Other men are
dying this day.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.743
I must attend them.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.372
Quiet!

18:45.504 --> 18:47.966
He's a highlander, by God!

18:48.007 --> 18:50.469
The last sound he hears...

18:50.511 --> 18:54.183
shouldn't be that
of a wailing woman!

19:18.887 --> 19:20.723
Hey, let me through.

19:20.807 --> 19:24.646
Damn it, Frank.
Forensics is supposed to be notified...

19:24.729 --> 19:26.899
the same time as homicide.

19:26.983 --> 19:28.443
Holy shit.

19:28.527 --> 19:30.363
Yeah, this one came unassembled.

19:30.405 --> 19:31.949
Did you make an arrest?

19:32.032 --> 19:35.162
No. We're questioning
some guy named Nash.

19:35.245 --> 19:37.499
Antique dealer on Hudson Street.

19:37.540 --> 19:40.169
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hey, Walt.

19:40.211 --> 19:42.506
You look pretty, Brenda.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.008
What do you think's...

19:44.050 --> 19:45.886
the cause of death,
Lieutenant, huh?

19:45.928 --> 19:49.308
You're a barrel
of laughs, Garfield.

19:49.392 --> 19:51.353
Get your hands off!

19:51.436 --> 19:54.399
Try explaining this to my wife!

19:54.441 --> 19:57.737
Get me a cherry-cheese danish too.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.907
What time did he buy it?

19:59.991 --> 20:01.493
About 10:00, 10:30.

20:01.577 --> 20:04.205
Whatever cut him
was razor sharp.

20:04.289 --> 20:08.212
Get out of here
with these cameras!

20:08.295 --> 20:10.256
Frank! Frank!

20:10.298 --> 20:12.384
Oh, my God.

20:12.426 --> 20:16.265
A guy was killed
like this in Jersey.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.103
What the hell.
That's Jersey.

20:19.186 --> 20:20.730
I want out!

20:20.814 --> 20:23.067
Hey, Frank. Come here.

20:24.110 --> 20:26.447
Aw, shit!

20:27.699 --> 20:31.622
Ooh, baby.
Look at you.

20:31.663 --> 20:34.751
Garfield, cover that head.

20:36.671 --> 20:39.133
Oh...

20:39.175 --> 20:42.138
What the hell
have you got?

20:42.179 --> 20:44.433
A Toledo-Salamanca.

20:44.516 --> 20:45.852
A what?

20:45.935 --> 20:48.606
A sword, Frank.
A very rare sword.

20:48.689 --> 20:50.650
Is it worth much?

20:50.734 --> 20:53.154
Only about a million bucks.

20:54.740 --> 20:57.160
Any antique dealer
on Hudson Street...

20:57.244 --> 20:58.662
could tell you that.

21:01.208 --> 21:04.171
You can't keep me here!

21:04.212 --> 21:06.341
I know my rights!

21:34.925 --> 21:38.890
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

21:38.931 --> 21:41.143
His name's Vazilek,
Polish national.

21:41.227 --> 21:44.565
Had his head chopped off
in New Jersey two nights ago.

21:44.648 --> 21:47.152
You ever get over
to New Jersey, Nash?

21:47.236 --> 21:49.322
Not if I can help it.

21:49.406 --> 21:51.283
You talk funny.
Where you from?

21:51.367 --> 21:53.328
Lots of different places.

21:53.412 --> 21:56.792
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hmm.

21:56.875 --> 21:59.462
Okay. What's that?

22:03.594 --> 22:05.179
A sword?

22:05.263 --> 22:07.307
Wise up, smart ass.

22:08.726 --> 22:13.024
It's a Toledo-Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million bucks.

22:13.108 --> 22:14.443
So?

22:14.485 --> 22:16.363
So you want to hear a theory?

22:16.446 --> 22:20.160
You went down that garage
to buy this sword from that guy--

22:20.244 --> 22:22.747
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

22:22.789 --> 22:24.709
Okay, his name's
lman Fasil.

22:24.792 --> 22:27.755
You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

22:27.838 --> 22:30.217
Want to hear another theory?

22:30.300 --> 22:32.762
This Fasil was so upset...

22:32.804 --> 22:35.391
about the lousy
wrestling tonight...

22:35.475 --> 22:41.609
in a fit of depression,
he cut off his own head.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.529
That's not funny, Walt.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.573
Are you a faggot, Nash?

22:45.657 --> 22:48.453
Why? You cruising
for a piece of ass?

22:50.289 --> 22:52.167
I'll tell you
what happened, Russell.

22:52.250 --> 22:55.171
You went down to the garage
for a blow job.

22:55.255 --> 22:57.508
You just didn't
want to pay for it.

22:57.591 --> 23:00.387
Huh. You are sick.

23:01.389 --> 23:02.724
Hey! Hey!

23:02.808 --> 23:05.311
Hey, what are you doing?

23:05.395 --> 23:06.563
Stop!

23:06.647 --> 23:09.109
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

23:09.192 --> 23:12.614
That's enough!
Now, cut it out!

23:12.698 --> 23:15.327
Goddamn it,
I said cut it out!

23:16.537 --> 23:19.458
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

23:19.541 --> 23:21.502
Then we're through.

23:21.544 --> 23:23.881
Nash, we're just
getting started.

23:27.178 --> 23:29.515
...in water from the sprinkler.

23:29.556 --> 23:32.477
It also left a man's
decapitated body...

23:32.561 --> 23:35.941
next to his own severed head.

23:36.024 --> 23:39.488
A head which at this time
has no name.

23:39.571 --> 23:41.658
I know his name.

23:43.953 --> 23:46.665
* Here I am *

23:46.749 --> 23:50.671
* I'm the master
of your destiny *

23:51.756 --> 23:53.426
Ahh!

23:54.803 --> 23:57.849
* I am the one
The only one *

23:57.932 --> 24:00.812
* I am the god
of kingdom come *

24:00.895 --> 24:03.190
* Give me the prize *

24:03.274 --> 24:05.694
* Just give me the prize **

24:15.417 --> 24:18.046
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger.

24:18.129 --> 24:19.673
Room 315.

24:19.757 --> 24:23.554
And I'll hit you
for 20 in advance.

24:28.603 --> 24:29.981
Uh, hey, uh.

24:30.064 --> 24:32.484
If there's anything
you need--

24:32.568 --> 24:36.240
Broads, uh, blow.
Just dial 0, huh?

24:36.323 --> 24:38.619
That's right, Mr. Kruger.

24:38.702 --> 24:41.456
Lucky Strike means
fine tobacco.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.835
Don't talk to the guests.

24:43.918 --> 24:45.546
I didn't do nothing.

25:37.499 --> 25:39.544
At last...

25:39.627 --> 25:41.421
the gathering.

25:45.594 --> 25:46.930
Hi.

25:46.971 --> 25:48.390
I'm Candy.

25:52.146 --> 25:54.107
Of course you are.

26:04.623 --> 26:06.084
Come on in.

26:06.125 --> 26:09.589
Hiya. Got a present
from the coroner.

26:09.631 --> 26:14.596
Pieces of metal found
on the dead guy under the Garden.

26:14.638 --> 26:17.434
In the wound
and on the clothes.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.395
Real smooth shave.

26:35.711 --> 26:38.633
That can't be right.

26:43.849 --> 26:45.643
Son of a bitch.

27:44.398 --> 27:45.984
Who's there?

28:03.135 --> 28:05.639
Hey, Brenda. Usual?

28:05.722 --> 28:07.141
Lots of it.

28:07.224 --> 28:08.643
Oh.

28:08.727 --> 28:13.150
* ls better than
a lifetime alone *

28:13.233 --> 28:14.819
Say when.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.658
* One sentimental moment
in your arms *

28:18.742 --> 28:19.827
When.

28:21.412 --> 28:22.873
* ls like a shooting star... *

28:22.956 --> 28:25.585
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

28:25.669 --> 28:28.089
Double Glenmoran on the rocks.

28:28.172 --> 28:29.508
Glenmoran. Right.

28:29.591 --> 28:32.053
Go to the Garden often?

28:32.137 --> 28:34.682
What did you say?

28:34.766 --> 28:36.351
Hmm?

28:36.435 --> 28:40.942
* I'm a prisoner of love
inside you *

28:41.025 --> 28:45.657
* I'm falling apart all around you *

28:45.741 --> 28:47.827
What did you say?

28:49.288 --> 28:52.334
Madison...Square...Garden.

28:53.794 --> 28:56.215
Do you go there often?

28:56.298 --> 28:57.341
Why?

28:58.718 --> 29:00.221
Basketball?

29:00.304 --> 29:02.349
The circus? Wrestling?

29:02.432 --> 29:05.687
Why are you asking me?

29:05.771 --> 29:07.732
Have you been following me?

29:07.774 --> 29:11.863
I'd like to walk
you home, Brenda.

29:13.866 --> 29:15.368
Uh...

29:17.831 --> 29:21.085
I can take care of myself.

29:21.169 --> 29:27.846
* It's always a rainy day without you *

29:27.929 --> 29:33.062
* I'm a prisoner of love
inside you *

29:33.104 --> 29:36.108
* I'm falling apart *

29:36.150 --> 29:40.114
* All around you **

30:32.860 --> 30:33.820
Huh!

30:33.862 --> 30:34.947
Aah!

30:35.030 --> 30:36.365
Be quiet!

30:36.407 --> 30:37.576
Unnhhrr!

30:40.872 --> 30:42.458
Aah!

30:52.890 --> 30:54.852
Here. Take this.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.347
Ha ha ha!

31:20.515 --> 31:21.433
Aah!

31:21.517 --> 31:23.812
Oh!

31:25.272 --> 31:28.319
Nice to see you
again, Macleod.

31:28.402 --> 31:30.155
Nice to see you--

31:30.238 --> 31:32.241
Ooh!

31:32.325 --> 31:34.328
- Ooh!
- Stop!

31:34.411 --> 31:36.164
There can be only one!

31:40.003 --> 31:41.672
No!

31:41.756 --> 31:42.924
Unh!

31:43.007 --> 31:44.218
Unnhhrr!

31:45.303 --> 31:46.638
You, on the ground.

31:46.721 --> 31:48.391
This is the police.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.769
Put down your weapons.

31:50.811 --> 31:52.689
Hands on your head.

31:52.772 --> 31:55.693
Another time, Highlander!
I will find you!

31:55.777 --> 31:58.823
Hold it right there!

31:58.906 --> 32:00.659
Come back here!

32:04.248 --> 32:05.166
Stop!

32:05.249 --> 32:06.668
Wait!

32:06.751 --> 32:08.170
Who was that?

32:08.254 --> 32:09.673
He called you Highlander.

32:09.756 --> 32:11.717
"There can be only one"?

32:11.801 --> 32:13.178
Only one what?

32:13.261 --> 32:16.224
- I want to know!
- Shut up!

32:16.308 --> 32:19.187
Don't you ever
follow me again.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.732
You only have one life.

32:21.816 --> 32:24.862
If you value it...
go home.

32:30.746 --> 32:33.333
Ha ha!

32:36.755 --> 32:38.716
You saw the wound.

32:38.758 --> 32:40.678
He should have died.

32:40.719 --> 32:43.724
I say he's got
the devil in him.

33:04.255 --> 33:07.217
Drinking with us, are you?

33:07.301 --> 33:08.887
What's the matter, Dugal?

33:08.928 --> 33:10.556
You, talking
and breathing...

33:10.598 --> 33:13.811
and last night,
all but a corpse.

33:13.894 --> 33:15.563
How did you manage that?

33:15.605 --> 33:17.859
You'd rather I was dead?

33:17.942 --> 33:19.862
It's not natural.

33:22.115 --> 33:24.869
He's in league with Lucifer.

33:24.953 --> 33:27.999
Don't say that, Kate.

33:28.082 --> 33:29.918
I'll say it.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.172
You've the devil in you.

33:32.255 --> 33:35.343
We've been kinsmen 20 years.

33:35.427 --> 33:37.930
Connor Macleod was my kinsman.

33:37.972 --> 33:41.310
I don't know who you are.

33:46.986 --> 33:48.071
Angus.

33:48.154 --> 33:50.074
You better go, Connor.

33:52.828 --> 33:55.039
I'm not going anywhere.

33:55.123 --> 33:57.293
He's the devil!
Kill him!

33:57.376 --> 33:58.461
Lucifer!

34:05.764 --> 34:07.433
Burn the devil out of him!

34:16.362 --> 34:19.159
All right.
Get him down.

34:19.243 --> 34:20.411
Burn him!

34:21.371 --> 34:23.416
Leave him be!

34:23.498 --> 34:24.751
Dugal...

34:24.833 --> 34:26.712
Oh!

34:26.754 --> 34:29.884
He's your cousin, man!

34:38.605 --> 34:40.190
No, Angus!

34:40.274 --> 34:41.275
Quiet!

34:41.359 --> 34:42.860
Quiet!

34:43.862 --> 34:46.074
There'll be no burning
here today!

34:46.158 --> 34:47.702
We'll banish him!

34:47.744 --> 34:50.498
No! Burn him!

34:50.581 --> 34:51.958
Stop it, Kate!

34:52.042 --> 34:53.502
Burn him!

34:54.754 --> 34:57.091
Angus, burn him!

34:57.132 --> 34:58.301
Can you walk?

34:58.385 --> 35:00.388
I'll bloody well
walk out of here.

35:00.430 --> 35:03.225
Then go!
While there's still time.

35:04.561 --> 35:07.315
I'll not forget you, Angus.

37:15.883 --> 37:18.429
That's a good dog.

37:26.024 --> 37:29.654
Pie and ale.
Do you want it?

37:29.738 --> 37:32.200
Aye. Right now.

37:32.283 --> 37:35.705
You filthy sod!
You're all muck and muscle.

37:35.788 --> 37:39.544
Aye, blossom.
The way you like it.

37:39.628 --> 37:40.921
Ha ha ha!

37:41.005 --> 37:43.258
Ha ha!

37:43.341 --> 37:44.218
Ahh!

37:44.301 --> 37:45.553
Waah!

38:00.409 --> 38:03.998
You can do that to me
forever, my lord.

38:07.336 --> 38:08.796
Will you, Connor?

38:08.880 --> 38:11.509
Aye, blossom. I will.

38:18.269 --> 38:20.022
Whoa!

38:25.196 --> 38:26.657
Greetings.

38:26.740 --> 38:30.287
I am Juan Sanchez
Villa-Lobos Ramirez...

38:30.371 --> 38:34.544
chief metallurgist
to King Charles V of Spain...

38:34.627 --> 38:37.006
and I'm at your service.

38:37.089 --> 38:38.550
Who?

38:42.472 --> 38:44.726
What do you want?

38:44.767 --> 38:46.436
You.

38:49.441 --> 38:50.902
You're Connor Macleod.

38:50.943 --> 38:52.612
Maybe I am and--

38:52.696 --> 38:55.867
You're Connor Macleod,
wounded in battle...

38:55.951 --> 38:59.915
and driven from your village
five years ago.

38:59.999 --> 39:01.668
- Connor!
- Ohh!

39:01.751 --> 39:05.173
Heather, go in the house.

39:05.256 --> 39:06.717
I'll stay right here.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.845
Do as I say, woman!

39:17.817 --> 39:20.780
Aaah!

39:20.822 --> 39:21.740
Aah!

39:21.823 --> 39:23.242
Aaah!

39:23.325 --> 39:28.249
The sensation you're feeling
is the quickening.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.421
Who are you?

39:31.504 --> 39:34.050
We are the same, Macleod!

39:34.133 --> 39:37.639
We are brothers!

39:43.648 --> 39:47.028
I knew you guys
were bottle-fed.

39:47.111 --> 39:52.536
Well, there's not a lot
I can do about it, pal.

39:52.619 --> 39:55.040
See what I'm up against?

39:55.081 --> 39:58.420
His Vietnamese neighbor
ate his dog.

39:58.503 --> 40:00.882
Uh...
that's confidential.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.801
How are things
in forensics?

40:02.885 --> 40:05.222
Dull. How about lunch?

40:05.305 --> 40:08.226
Lunch? It's a good idea.
Who pays?

40:08.310 --> 40:09.436
Me.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.939
You're on.

40:11.022 --> 40:12.942
By the way, Frank...

40:13.025 --> 40:15.404
the hairs in the Moretti case...

40:15.487 --> 40:16.948
matched up.

40:17.031 --> 40:19.034
Oh, I forgot my purse.

40:19.076 --> 40:21.997
I'll meet you outside.

40:22.080 --> 40:25.168
Garfield, Brenda and I
are going to lunch.

41:09.527 --> 41:11.488
Sometimes, Macleod...

41:11.530 --> 41:14.618
the sharpest blade is not enough.

41:17.998 --> 41:26.219
* B-A-L-A-N-C-E
Balance **

41:26.302 --> 41:28.305
I don't like boats!
I don't like water!

41:28.347 --> 41:31.268
I'm a man, not a fish.

41:31.351 --> 41:33.396
Oh, you complain endlessly.

41:33.480 --> 41:37.235
You look like a woman,
you stupid haggis.

41:37.319 --> 41:38.821
Haggis? What is haggis?

41:38.904 --> 41:41.074
Sheep's stomach stuffed
with meat and barley.

41:41.158 --> 41:43.787
And what do you
do with it?

41:43.870 --> 41:45.539
You eat it.

41:45.623 --> 41:47.918
How revolting.

41:48.001 --> 41:49.003
Ah-choo!

41:49.086 --> 41:51.715
Be still.
You'll tip us over!

41:51.799 --> 41:52.759
So?

41:52.842 --> 41:55.554
I cannot swim,
you Spanish peacock.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.057
I'm not Spanish.
I'm Egyptian.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.145
You said you were
from Spain! Liar!

42:00.228 --> 42:03.608
You have the manners
of a goat...

42:03.692 --> 42:07.072
and you smell like dung.

42:07.155 --> 42:10.452
And you have no knowledge
whatsoever of your potential.

42:10.535 --> 42:12.371
Now, get out!

42:12.413 --> 42:13.582
No!

42:14.667 --> 42:16.085
Help!

42:16.169 --> 42:18.673
Help! Help!

42:20.676 --> 42:22.679
Help!

42:22.762 --> 42:24.640
Help me, I'm drowning!

42:24.723 --> 42:27.603
You can't drown, you fool.
You're immortal!

42:30.440 --> 42:33.069
I'm drowning!
Come help!

42:33.153 --> 42:39.370
* We ask you...
Heavenly Father **

42:41.666 --> 42:43.335
I'm alive.

42:48.509 --> 42:49.970
I can breathe.

42:59.275 --> 43:00.611
Ha ha ha!

43:00.652 --> 43:03.031
Ha ha ha ha!

43:08.998 --> 43:11.586
I'll slice you in half.

43:35.664 --> 43:36.665
Hah!

43:37.875 --> 43:39.544
Crude and slow, clansman.

43:39.628 --> 43:43.592
Your attack was no better
than that of a clumsy child.

43:43.676 --> 43:45.762
Hah!

43:51.312 --> 43:55.902
This cannot be.
It's the devil's work.

43:58.698 --> 44:03.038
You cannot die, Macleod.
Accept it.

44:03.122 --> 44:04.582
Ha ha ha!

44:04.665 --> 44:06.376
Ha ha ha!

44:08.046 --> 44:09.423
I hate you.

44:09.506 --> 44:10.424
Good.

44:10.508 --> 44:12.636
That is a perfect
way to start.

44:14.597 --> 44:15.557
Tell me...

44:15.599 --> 44:17.769
how did it happen,
for God's sake?

44:20.773 --> 44:24.237
Why does the sun
come up, hmm?

44:24.320 --> 44:28.368
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night?

44:28.451 --> 44:30.329
Who knows?

44:30.413 --> 44:32.165
What I do know is...

44:32.249 --> 44:34.043
because you were
born different...

44:34.127 --> 44:38.592
men will fear you,
try to drive you away...

44:38.633 --> 44:40.928
Iike the people
of your village.

44:51.778 --> 44:55.742
You must learn to conceal
your special gift...

44:55.784 --> 44:57.704
and harness your power...

44:57.787 --> 45:00.875
until the time
of the gathering.

45:03.796 --> 45:05.298
What gathering?

45:05.465 --> 45:08.178
When only a few of us
are left...

45:08.261 --> 45:10.014
we will feel
an irresistible pull...

45:10.097 --> 45:13.394
towards a faraway land...

45:13.477 --> 45:15.480
to fight for the prize.

45:18.861 --> 45:20.279
Come on!

45:21.323 --> 45:22.908
Faster!

45:30.837 --> 45:32.256
Unh!

45:32.339 --> 45:34.342
Never lose your temper.

45:34.384 --> 45:37.764
If your head comes away
from your neck...

45:37.847 --> 45:39.308
it's over.

45:45.776 --> 45:47.237
Ha ha ha!

46:03.302 --> 46:04.304
Unnh!

46:04.387 --> 46:07.308
Never overextend
your thrust.

46:07.392 --> 46:09.770
You're vulnerable and...

46:09.854 --> 46:11.690
off balance.

46:11.774 --> 46:13.902
Connor! Ha ha ha!

46:15.487 --> 46:17.365
Heather, please.

46:29.509 --> 46:35.184
If it came down to us two,
would you take my head?

46:35.267 --> 46:36.644
Ha!

46:38.939 --> 46:41.819
We must fight
until only one remains.

46:41.860 --> 46:45.282
You are safe only on holy ground.

46:45.324 --> 46:48.954
None of us will violate that law.

46:49.038 --> 46:50.582
It's tradition.

47:03.309 --> 47:05.479
Now for the last.

47:05.521 --> 47:08.150
Trust me.

47:11.739 --> 47:14.493
Let yourself
feel the stag.

47:17.414 --> 47:19.375
His heart...

47:19.417 --> 47:21.003
beating.

47:28.055 --> 47:31.143
His blood...coursing.

47:31.226 --> 47:33.188
Feel?

47:34.398 --> 47:35.775
Come on!

47:35.858 --> 47:38.863
I feel him.

47:38.946 --> 47:41.450
Macleod, come on!

47:41.534 --> 47:42.994
I feel him!

47:43.078 --> 47:44.830
Come on!

47:44.914 --> 47:47.292
Ha ha ha!

47:47.376 --> 47:50.130
I feel him!

47:50.213 --> 47:52.133
Ha ha ha!

47:52.216 --> 47:54.428
Ha ha ha!

47:54.511 --> 47:56.765
Come on, haggis!

48:00.228 --> 48:02.315
Macleod.

48:02.398 --> 48:04.652
This is the quickening.

48:04.735 --> 48:06.655
Yeah!

48:06.738 --> 48:07.990
Yaah!

48:40.706 --> 48:42.250
Now, pendejo...

48:42.333 --> 48:46.340
shall we see what sort of
swordsman you've become?

48:46.423 --> 48:48.176
En garde!

48:56.355 --> 48:57.899
Very good.

49:16.426 --> 49:19.556
Give me your hand, brother.

49:35.914 --> 49:37.834
That one there.

49:37.917 --> 49:40.004
How much is it?

49:56.153 --> 49:57.989
Put him in.

49:58.072 --> 50:01.411
But what I want is a family.

50:01.453 --> 50:03.873
You cannot have a family.

50:03.956 --> 50:06.377
We cannot have children.

50:06.460 --> 50:08.755
That won't please Heather.

50:08.797 --> 50:11.801
I'll tell you that
for nothing.

50:11.885 --> 50:14.514
He's full of life.

50:15.974 --> 50:17.560
Connor!

50:20.481 --> 50:22.067
Here's dinner!

50:23.986 --> 50:25.447
I'll be off now.

50:25.489 --> 50:28.076
I fancy buying
a new dress.

50:31.456 --> 50:35.504
Oh, you little devils!
Go on!

50:36.797 --> 50:38.508
She's beautiful.

50:39.844 --> 50:43.391
You must leave her,
brother.

50:53.990 --> 50:56.410
Macleod.

50:56.494 --> 50:59.373
I was born 2,437 years ago.

50:59.457 --> 51:02.878
In that time,
I've had three wives.

51:02.962 --> 51:06.384
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

51:06.467 --> 51:10.056
Her father, Masamune, a genius...

51:10.139 --> 51:12.393
made this for me...

51:12.476 --> 51:15.230
in 593 B.C.

51:16.524 --> 51:20.446
It is the only one
of its kind...

51:20.530 --> 51:22.450
Iike his daughter.

51:22.533 --> 51:25.788
When Shakiko died,
I was shattered.

51:25.871 --> 51:28.751
I would save you
that pain.

51:28.792 --> 51:31.755
Please.
Let Heather go.

51:50.325 --> 51:54.247
When we first met,
you felt ill, remember?

51:54.331 --> 51:56.626
That wasn't the first time...

51:56.668 --> 51:59.589
you felt
that sensation, was it?

51:59.672 --> 52:01.091
No.

52:01.174 --> 52:03.637
When the Macleods
fought the Frazers...

52:03.678 --> 52:06.224
and a black knight...

52:06.307 --> 52:08.477
I felt it then.

52:08.561 --> 52:10.981
Only it was more painful.

52:11.064 --> 52:13.485
That black knight
was the Kurgan.

52:13.568 --> 52:16.656
It's because of him
that I sought you out.

52:18.117 --> 52:19.994
Who is the Kurgan?

52:20.078 --> 52:21.997
Where does
he come from?

52:22.039 --> 52:24.167
The Kurgans were
an ancient people...

52:24.251 --> 52:25.878
from the steppes
of Russia.

52:25.962 --> 52:27.673
For amusement,
they tossed children...

52:27.714 --> 52:31.595
into pits with hungry dogs
to fight for meat.

52:31.679 --> 52:33.098
The Kurgan.

52:33.181 --> 52:36.311
He is the strongest
of the immortals.

52:36.352 --> 52:38.731
He is the perfect warrior.

52:38.814 --> 52:41.318
If he wins the prize...

52:41.402 --> 52:45.366
mortal man would suffer
an eternity of darkness.

52:45.408 --> 52:47.870
How do you fight
such a savage?

52:47.953 --> 52:52.627
Hmm. With heart,
faith, and steel.

52:52.710 --> 52:56.341
In the end,
there can be only one.

53:01.307 --> 53:03.643
very dangerous for you.

53:03.727 --> 53:06.189
Well, I was very much in love...

53:06.231 --> 53:07.483
with her, my dear.

53:07.566 --> 53:10.529
She was the only thing
on my mind.

53:10.571 --> 53:12.907
So, holding the rose
in my teeth...

53:12.991 --> 53:16.454
I climbed up on the rooftop,
lowered a rope...

53:16.538 --> 53:18.833
and swung in
through the open window.

53:21.587 --> 53:24.717
Unfortunately, the lady
was no longer there.

53:24.759 --> 53:26.177
What did you do?

53:26.261 --> 53:27.680
I introduced myself...

53:27.763 --> 53:30.183
to the lady that was there.

53:30.267 --> 53:31.769
She was most helpful.

53:34.106 --> 53:37.069
Would you like
some more wine?

53:37.152 --> 53:39.239
Yes, please.

53:49.755 --> 53:51.465
Heather.

53:51.507 --> 53:52.926
Get out!

53:52.968 --> 53:54.595
What's wrong?

53:59.978 --> 54:02.315
Get out!

54:02.399 --> 54:04.068
Aaah!

54:04.151 --> 54:05.612
Kurgan!

54:07.031 --> 54:08.950
Ramirez!

54:10.119 --> 54:14.584
Raah!

54:18.339 --> 54:21.845
The Highlander,
where is he?

54:21.928 --> 54:23.180
You're too late.

54:23.263 --> 54:25.225
I've prepared him
for you.

54:25.308 --> 54:26.852
You waste your time!

54:31.192 --> 54:32.819
Aah!

54:39.538 --> 54:41.708
Aah!

54:54.060 --> 54:56.397
It hurts?

55:01.112 --> 55:02.197
Raaah!

55:02.239 --> 55:03.532
Aaah!

55:08.081 --> 55:12.254
Now you die!
Heh heh heh!

55:14.924 --> 55:19.097
I am the strongest!

55:19.181 --> 55:22.144
My cut has improved
your voice.

55:22.227 --> 55:24.105
Rrr!

55:24.188 --> 55:30.364
Whoooa!

55:51.646 --> 55:53.566
Ha ha ha!

55:53.649 --> 55:56.362
Ha ha ha!

56:09.173 --> 56:10.299
Aah!

56:59.373 --> 57:03.046
Ohhhhhh!

57:03.129 --> 57:05.549
Yes!

57:12.602 --> 57:14.521
Yaa!

57:21.073 --> 57:23.451
Ha ha ha!

57:24.620 --> 57:25.746
Aah!

57:36.220 --> 57:39.601
Ahh. Hurts?

57:43.189 --> 57:45.484
Who is the woman?

57:46.695 --> 57:48.656
Oh! She's mine!

57:48.739 --> 57:50.158
Ahh.

57:50.242 --> 57:52.871
Not for much longer.

58:02.468 --> 58:05.181
Tonight you sleep
in hell!

58:05.264 --> 58:07.977
There can be only one!

58:44.073 --> 58:46.910
Whoooa!

58:52.878 --> 58:54.630
Aaah!

58:54.714 --> 58:57.760
Hello, pretty.

59:08.192 --> 59:10.237
I'd like to speak
to Russell Nash.

59:10.279 --> 59:13.283
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Nash isn't here.

59:13.367 --> 59:16.037
May I call him at home?

59:16.079 --> 59:17.957
That won't be possible.

59:18.040 --> 59:20.043
Good morning.

59:20.127 --> 59:23.048
This is Brenda Wyatt,
Mr. Nash.

59:24.342 --> 59:26.094
We've already met, Rachel.

59:26.136 --> 59:28.640
What can I do for you?

59:28.681 --> 59:30.142
I'd like some advice.

59:30.184 --> 59:33.063
Are you someone
who takes advice?

59:33.146 --> 59:34.607
That depends.

59:34.649 --> 59:36.193
Advice about what?

59:36.276 --> 59:38.738
What can you tell me
about a seven-foot lunatic...

59:38.822 --> 59:40.449
hacking away with a broadsword...

59:40.533 --> 59:43.078
at one in the morning,
New York City, 1985?

59:45.624 --> 59:47.460
Not much.

59:47.501 --> 59:50.297
A Japanese sword
dated 600 B.C...

59:50.339 --> 59:52.843
the metal folded 200 times?

59:52.926 --> 59:55.680
I don't deal
in exotic weapons.

59:55.764 --> 59:59.394
May I show you something
in 18th-century silver?

59:59.478 --> 01:00:03.484
That's not why I came.
You know it.

01:00:03.526 --> 01:00:05.195
Do you cook?

01:00:05.278 --> 01:00:06.614
Why?

01:00:06.655 --> 01:00:09.785
I thought
we might have dinner.

01:00:09.827 --> 01:00:11.538
Did you?

01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:12.748
Yes.

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:17.630
So I'm standing there,
and there's Brenda.

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.925
Our little Brenda.

01:00:20.009 --> 01:00:22.763
You're sure it was Brenda?

01:00:22.846 --> 01:00:26.685
She was in Nash's shop
talking to him.

01:00:34.781 --> 01:00:36.700
What are you
looking at, Rachel?

01:00:36.784 --> 01:00:39.371
The eyes in the back of your head.

01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:44.254
People are asking
about you.

01:00:44.295 --> 01:00:46.465
What am I supposed to say?

01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:48.218
Hmm?

01:00:48.301 --> 01:00:50.096
Tell them I'm immortal.

01:01:24.606 --> 01:01:26.066
Shh.

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:28.946
Quiet.

01:01:34.329 --> 01:01:36.165
Don't be frightened.

01:01:36.248 --> 01:01:38.794
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

01:01:38.877 --> 01:01:42.508
- What happened?
- Everybody's dead.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.970
Shh.

01:01:46.055 --> 01:01:48.141
I'm like you.
I'm alone.

01:01:48.225 --> 01:01:49.977
Come with me, Rachel.

01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:07.379
You're alive.
Why didn't you die?

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.674
Hey. It's a kind of magic.

01:02:09.716 --> 01:02:10.800
Shh.

01:02:12.637 --> 01:02:13.972
Ow!
Aah!

01:02:16.142 --> 01:02:18.145
- Move!
- Nein!

01:02:19.898 --> 01:02:22.318
Heh heh heh.
Whatever you say, Jack.

01:02:22.401 --> 01:02:23.987
You're the master race.

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:29.996
Let's go.

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:34.837
That was a long time ago.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.592
Would you listen to me
for one moment, please?

01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:41.054
You can't hide
your feelings from me.

01:02:41.138 --> 01:02:43.391
I've known you too long.

01:02:43.433 --> 01:02:45.060
What feelings?

01:02:45.102 --> 01:02:46.938
How about loneliness?

01:02:47.022 --> 01:02:49.609
I'm not lonely.

01:02:49.692 --> 01:02:52.530
I've got everything
I need right here.

01:02:52.613 --> 01:02:54.199
Oh, no, you don't.

01:02:54.283 --> 01:02:59.541
You refuse to let
anyone love you.

01:02:59.582 --> 01:03:01.794
Love is for poets.

01:03:05.424 --> 01:03:09.013
You're such
a romantic, Rachel.

01:03:09.097 --> 01:03:12.101
You always were.

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:35.762
Just a minute.

01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:56.626
Good evening.

01:04:00.883 --> 01:04:03.303
You want to dine
in the hall...

01:04:03.345 --> 01:04:05.139
or shall we step inside?

01:04:05.223 --> 01:04:07.017
Ohh.

01:04:07.059 --> 01:04:08.311
Come in.

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:11.733
May I take your coat?

01:04:11.816 --> 01:04:12.901
What? No, thanks.

01:04:12.984 --> 01:04:14.904
I'll hold on to it.

01:04:14.987 --> 01:04:16.573
Oh, fine.

01:04:20.037 --> 01:04:21.414
Where are you going?

01:04:21.497 --> 01:04:23.709
I forgot my earrings.

01:04:23.751 --> 01:04:25.670
Make yourself a drink.

01:04:25.754 --> 01:04:28.842
There are glasses in the bar.

01:04:32.639 --> 01:04:34.183
Hmm.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.070
You know what you're doing?

01:05:03.018 --> 01:05:05.313
I like your place, Brenda.

01:05:05.397 --> 01:05:09.736
I've been here three months.
Still fixing it up.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.704
Interesting view.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.790
What did you say?

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.510
I said, "lnteresting view"!

01:05:25.594 --> 01:05:27.263
Isn't it great?

01:05:33.147 --> 01:05:35.066
You never told me...

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:38.113
what you do
for a living.

01:05:38.196 --> 01:05:42.953
I work for
the Metropolitan Museum...

01:05:42.995 --> 01:05:45.749
in acquisitions.

01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:48.920
Huh. That explains
your interest...

01:05:49.004 --> 01:05:51.341
in ancient weapons.

01:05:53.344 --> 01:05:54.721
Right.

01:05:56.307 --> 01:05:59.353
Especially the samurai.

01:05:59.395 --> 01:06:00.939
Very nice.

01:06:01.022 --> 01:06:03.359
Shall we have a toast?

01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:04.945
Yes.

01:06:09.952 --> 01:06:11.913
Brandy.

01:06:11.997 --> 01:06:14.626
Bottled in 1783.

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:16.921
Wow. That's old.

01:06:19.759 --> 01:06:23.055
1783 was a very good year.

01:06:24.474 --> 01:06:26.936
Mozart wrote
his great mass.

01:06:26.978 --> 01:06:29.565
The Montgolfier Brothers went up...

01:06:29.648 --> 01:06:32.570
in their first balloon.

01:06:34.656 --> 01:06:35.950
Hah.

01:06:36.033 --> 01:06:37.953
And England recognized...

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.458
the independence
of the United States.

01:06:41.541 --> 01:06:43.962
Is that right?

01:06:44.003 --> 01:06:45.339
Yes.

01:06:52.892 --> 01:06:54.436
What's that?

01:06:54.519 --> 01:06:56.481
It's for you.

01:06:56.564 --> 01:06:58.108
Can I open it?

01:06:58.191 --> 01:06:59.902
If you like.

01:07:14.299 --> 01:07:15.175
You bastard.

01:07:15.259 --> 01:07:17.178
Where did you find this?

01:07:17.262 --> 01:07:19.348
I have an extensive library.

01:07:20.976 --> 01:07:22.228
Odd thing.

01:07:22.311 --> 01:07:24.690
Your bio doesn't
mention the Met.

01:07:24.773 --> 01:07:27.193
It says you work
for the police...

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:29.030
in forensics.

01:07:29.113 --> 01:07:31.199
Are you and Moran
setting me up?

01:07:31.283 --> 01:07:33.244
I don't work for Moran.

01:07:33.328 --> 01:07:35.706
Then why is that bald policeman...

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:38.210
sitting outside
watching your apartment?

01:07:40.004 --> 01:07:41.256
You remember him.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.675
Moran's had him tailing me.

01:07:42.717 --> 01:07:44.845
What are you going to do?

01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:47.599
Question is,
what are you going to do?

01:07:47.683 --> 01:07:50.353
Turn off the tape or
shoot me with the .45?

01:07:53.984 --> 01:07:55.903
I'm not looking
for a killer.

01:07:55.987 --> 01:07:57.406
I'm looking for a sword.

01:07:57.489 --> 01:07:59.450
The one used on Fasil.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:02.330
- I only want to see the samurai.
- Why?

01:08:02.413 --> 01:08:04.374
Because it's not
supposed to exist.

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:06.586
I dated the blade
at 600 B.C.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.965
The metal had been
folded 200 times.

01:08:09.048 --> 01:08:12.512
The Japanese didn't make swords
like that till the Middle Ages.

01:08:12.595 --> 01:08:14.890
So where the hell
did it come from?

01:08:14.932 --> 01:08:16.893
If I could verify
its existence...

01:08:16.935 --> 01:08:19.397
it would be like
discovering a 747...

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:22.443
a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

01:08:22.484 --> 01:08:24.947
This is crazy.

01:08:24.988 --> 01:08:27.576
Wait a minute, Nash.
I want some answers.

01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:31.457
You want?

01:08:31.499 --> 01:08:33.919
Don't you ever
think about anything...

01:08:33.961 --> 01:08:35.587
except what you want?

01:08:49.984 --> 01:08:52.071
You must leave her, brother.

01:08:59.624 --> 01:09:04.131
* There's no time for us *

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:11.642
* There's no place for us *

01:09:12.935 --> 01:09:20.197
* What is this thing
that fills our dreams *

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:25.037
* Yet slips away from us? *

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:34.969
* Who wants to live forever? *

01:09:35.053 --> 01:09:41.979
* Who wants to live forever? *

01:09:42.063 --> 01:09:47.988
* Ooh *

01:09:48.072 --> 01:09:51.661
* There's no chance for us *

01:09:53.831 --> 01:10:00.841
* It's all decided for us *

01:10:00.925 --> 01:10:08.561
* This world has
only one sweet moment *

01:10:08.603 --> 01:10:12.651
* Set aside for us *

01:10:12.818 --> 01:10:14.237
Heather!

01:10:15.781 --> 01:10:22.582
* Who wants to live forever? *

01:10:22.624 --> 01:10:30.052
* Who wants to live forever? *

01:10:30.135 --> 01:10:31.179
* Ooh *

01:10:31.262 --> 01:10:32.222
Heather!

01:10:33.975 --> 01:10:36.770
Connor, I'm here!

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:47.119
* Who dares to love forever *

01:10:47.203 --> 01:10:52.461
* Oh-ooh *

01:10:52.502 --> 01:10:55.590
* When love must die? **

01:10:58.178 --> 01:11:00.640
My beautiful man.

01:11:00.681 --> 01:11:02.643
My husband.

01:11:02.684 --> 01:11:05.814
I am that, my love.

01:11:09.695 --> 01:11:13.075
I've never really known...

01:11:13.159 --> 01:11:14.744
What?

01:11:16.497 --> 01:11:18.750
Why you stayed.

01:11:20.169 --> 01:11:23.591
Because I love you
as much now...

01:11:23.674 --> 01:11:26.595
as the first day we met.

01:11:26.679 --> 01:11:29.266
And I love you.

01:11:33.731 --> 01:11:36.611
I don't want to die.

01:11:36.694 --> 01:11:41.117
I want to stay
with you forever.

01:11:41.201 --> 01:11:43.120
I want that too.

01:11:43.204 --> 01:11:46.793
Will you do something
for me, Connor?

01:11:49.213 --> 01:11:50.632
What, lass?

01:11:50.715 --> 01:11:54.638
In the years to come,
will you light a candle...

01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:57.767
and remember me
on my birthday?

01:11:57.851 --> 01:12:02.483
Aye, love. I will.

01:12:02.566 --> 01:12:06.238
I wanted to have
your children.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:10.537
They would have been
strong and fine.

01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:17.213
Don't see me, Connor.

01:12:17.255 --> 01:12:20.009
Let me die in peace.

01:12:22.596 --> 01:12:24.892
Where are we?

01:12:31.234 --> 01:12:34.197
We're in the highlands.

01:12:36.075 --> 01:12:38.203
Where else?

01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:43.670
Running down a mountainside.

01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:59.861
The sun is shining.

01:13:01.154 --> 01:13:02.698
It's not cold.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.623
You've got your sheepskins on...

01:13:09.792 --> 01:13:13.506
and the boots
I made for you.

01:13:17.012 --> 01:13:19.515
Good night,
my bonny Heather.

01:13:34.788 --> 01:13:37.376
Hey! Kastagir.

01:13:38.252 --> 01:13:41.716
Macleod, it's good
to see you again.

01:13:41.799 --> 01:13:44.720
It seems like 100 years.

01:13:44.804 --> 01:13:47.391
It's been 100 years.

01:13:55.111 --> 01:13:57.072
How have you been?

01:13:58.908 --> 01:14:01.287
Hey, this...

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:05.209
puts hairs on your chest.

01:14:07.796 --> 01:14:09.257
What is it?

01:14:09.299 --> 01:14:10.634
Boom-boom.

01:14:10.718 --> 01:14:12.262
Big strong man like you...

01:14:12.303 --> 01:14:15.016
shouldn't be afraid
of a little boom-boom.

01:14:15.099 --> 01:14:18.145
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.

01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:19.981
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

01:14:21.484 --> 01:14:25.448
So...
the gathering is here.

01:14:25.531 --> 01:14:27.451
Ahh.

01:14:27.493 --> 01:14:29.704
Time's almost
caught us, friend.

01:14:29.788 --> 01:14:32.709
Has it? Do you think
we should go on?

01:14:34.962 --> 01:14:37.383
I think we should
have a party.

01:14:37.466 --> 01:14:40.638
Oh, no. I remember
our last party.

01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:41.723
Really?

01:14:41.806 --> 01:14:43.267
When exactly was that?

01:14:43.308 --> 01:14:45.228
It was 1783.

01:14:45.311 --> 01:14:47.940
1783.

01:14:47.982 --> 01:14:49.401
Oh, yes.

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.905
Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.407
Ha ha ha!
You were drunk.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.911
What was that guy's name again?

01:14:55.994 --> 01:14:57.455
His name was Bassett.

01:14:57.496 --> 01:14:58.873
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.

01:14:58.957 --> 01:14:59.917
I implore you.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.547
I am fighting this duel,
Hotchkiss, not you.

01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:05.884
See if the imbecile is ready.

01:15:05.967 --> 01:15:08.388
Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

01:15:08.429 --> 01:15:10.307
Tell him I'm ready.

01:15:10.391 --> 01:15:13.145
Christ! I've gone blind.

01:15:14.105 --> 01:15:15.982
En garde, sir.

01:15:16.066 --> 01:15:18.528
Ohh!

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:21.157
Wonderful, sir.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.035
Thank you, Hotchkiss.

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:24.829
Bassett?

01:15:24.871 --> 01:15:27.124
That you?

01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:29.336
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

01:15:32.215 --> 01:15:33.634
Unh!

01:15:33.717 --> 01:15:34.802
Oh.

01:15:36.096 --> 01:15:38.224
The sword, the sword.

01:15:38.308 --> 01:15:40.561
Ha ha ha!

01:15:49.825 --> 01:15:51.578
Stop, sir.

01:15:51.619 --> 01:15:53.831
I beseech you.

01:15:53.915 --> 01:15:56.752
I apologize for
calling your wife...

01:15:56.794 --> 01:15:59.256
- a bloated warthog--
- Ha ha ha!

01:15:59.298 --> 01:16:02.344
And I bid you good day.

01:16:04.263 --> 01:16:05.599
Shoot him, sir.

01:16:05.641 --> 01:16:06.559
Shoot him.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.728
Now, sir, in the back!
Now, sir!

01:16:08.812 --> 01:16:11.816
Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss!
Stop it!

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:15.155
* Hotchkiss *

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:16.198
What?

01:16:16.282 --> 01:16:17.158
No, sir.

01:16:17.241 --> 01:16:19.662
No, no...

01:16:19.745 --> 01:16:21.706
No! No! No!

01:16:25.796 --> 01:16:28.842
That's the mood
of New York now.

01:16:28.926 --> 01:16:30.845
Get out of here!

01:16:30.929 --> 01:16:32.222
So far...

01:16:39.274 --> 01:16:41.695
Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure...

01:16:41.737 --> 01:16:44.199
the mayor's office issued
the following statement...

01:16:44.282 --> 01:16:45.784
Give us a drink, pal.

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:48.246
Got a joint?

01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:49.707
...vigorous investigation...

01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:52.711
following up on
some promising leads.

01:16:52.795 --> 01:16:56.217
Hey, Rockefeller,
how'd you like Candy?

01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.056
She said you were
kind of kinky, huh?

01:17:00.139 --> 01:17:03.352
Don't ever speak to me.

01:17:05.314 --> 01:17:07.734
I didn't mean nothin'.

01:17:07.817 --> 01:17:09.904
Look, I didn't mean--

01:17:12.116 --> 01:17:16.455
Don't ever speak
to me again.

01:17:16.539 --> 01:17:18.667
Do you understand?

01:17:19.627 --> 01:17:20.712
Yeah.

01:17:20.795 --> 01:17:23.257
Good.

01:17:25.886 --> 01:17:30.393
I hope you get your head
chopped off, asshole.

01:17:32.772 --> 01:17:34.232
And you!

01:17:34.274 --> 01:17:35.568
Shut it!

01:17:39.323 --> 01:17:41.493
* Here we stand *

01:17:41.577 --> 01:17:44.206
* And here we fall *

01:17:44.289 --> 01:17:47.210
* History won't care at all *

01:17:47.252 --> 01:17:48.879
* Lay on the bed *

01:17:48.963 --> 01:17:51.300
* Put out the light *

01:17:51.383 --> 01:17:55.013
* ...won't be home tonight, yeah *

01:17:55.097 --> 01:17:58.018
* We don't waste no time at all... *

01:17:58.101 --> 01:18:00.647
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

01:18:02.483 --> 01:18:04.111
* Comes to you... *

01:18:04.194 --> 01:18:08.283
* Ahh, we just waited
for another... **

01:18:08.367 --> 01:18:10.120
What the hell?

01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:26.728
Okay, marine,
this is for real!

01:18:31.026 --> 01:18:32.487
Yah!

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:33.613
Let's go!

01:18:36.952 --> 01:18:40.290
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on!

01:18:52.225 --> 01:18:55.396
What the hell
is going on?

01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:09.501
Ahh!

01:19:23.063 --> 01:19:25.817
Is somebody trapped
in there?

01:20:32.542 --> 01:20:35.672
Aah! Aah!

01:20:49.025 --> 01:20:49.943
For God's sake!

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:54.993
Ooo!

01:21:02.671 --> 01:21:04.048
Look at that!

01:21:05.383 --> 01:21:13.229
Uuuuhh!

01:21:30.755 --> 01:21:32.257
Rrr!

01:21:33.509 --> 01:21:36.096
Ha ha.

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:38.141
Aah! Aah!

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:43.733
Mother of God.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.450
Mom.

01:21:49.533 --> 01:21:50.493
Boo!

01:21:50.576 --> 01:21:53.915
Aah!

01:21:53.957 --> 01:21:57.378
Hey, where are you
going with my car?

01:21:57.462 --> 01:22:00.758
Daddy, help me! Daddy!
Daddy, help me!

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.718
Help, Daddy!

01:22:01.802 --> 01:22:03.471
Daddy, help me!

01:22:09.063 --> 01:22:10.940
Frank, take it easy.

01:22:11.024 --> 01:22:12.985
I checked everywhere.

01:22:13.027 --> 01:22:14.988
There aren't any witnesses.

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.867
That's New York for you.

01:22:17.909 --> 01:22:20.455
Twenty people standing around.
Nobody saw a thing.

01:22:20.538 --> 01:22:23.334
Tell me about Matunas.
Is he on drugs?

01:22:23.376 --> 01:22:24.795
He's a survival nut.

01:22:24.878 --> 01:22:26.339
What?

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.342
He was a marine.

01:22:28.383 --> 01:22:31.304
His ex-c.o. said
he was paranoid...

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:34.309
but he was a good man.

01:22:34.392 --> 01:22:36.312
How you doing, kid?

01:22:36.395 --> 01:22:38.983
Okay, for a guy who got three feet
of steel crammed through his gut.

01:22:39.066 --> 01:22:40.527
How you doing?

01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:44.366
I understand
you saw who stuck you?

01:22:44.533 --> 01:22:46.202
You kidding me, man?

01:22:46.244 --> 01:22:47.913
Is that him?

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:49.206
Nope.

01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:52.169
Quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley.

01:22:52.253 --> 01:22:54.631
The freak was trying to kill me!

01:22:54.715 --> 01:22:58.178
He had a scar
across his neck.

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:00.139
That ain't him.

01:23:00.223 --> 01:23:01.850
Shit.

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.731
Depressed?

01:23:05.773 --> 01:23:07.233
Yeah.

01:23:07.317 --> 01:23:10.405
You don't know grunt
about depressed.

01:23:10.488 --> 01:23:12.867
I got me a .357.

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:15.371
Got me a trunk load
of shotguns.

01:23:15.454 --> 01:23:17.541
I got three big-bore
battle rifles...

01:23:17.624 --> 01:23:18.626
ammo up the ass...

01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:20.545
and I ain't safe!

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:22.214
I can't protect myself!

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:24.217
Okay, take it easy, pal.

01:23:24.301 --> 01:23:26.179
That weirdo, man.

01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:29.308
He got up after I put
enough lead in him...

01:23:29.392 --> 01:23:30.811
to drop a rhino.

01:23:30.894 --> 01:23:33.189
Hey, listen,
could you work...

01:23:33.273 --> 01:23:35.276
with one of our artists?

01:23:35.359 --> 01:23:37.779
Get a picture of this guy?

01:23:37.863 --> 01:23:39.949
Sure, sure.

01:23:40.033 --> 01:23:43.121
Thanks.
Take it easy, pal.

01:23:43.163 --> 01:23:44.707
Hey, cop.

01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:45.792
Yeah.

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:48.587
I know you guys
think I'm nuts...

01:23:48.671 --> 01:23:51.634
but there's something else
I gotta tell you.

01:23:51.717 --> 01:23:55.139
After he threw me
against the wall--

01:24:14.668 --> 01:24:16.504
This is like
"One Step Beyond".

01:24:16.546 --> 01:24:19.133
All we got is an eyewitness.

01:24:19.217 --> 01:24:21.512
Don't say anything
about sword fights...

01:24:21.595 --> 01:24:23.598
or guys glowing in the dark
for Christ's sake.

01:24:25.142 --> 01:24:26.728
Hey, Moran!

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:28.731
Have you read this?

01:24:28.815 --> 01:24:32.904
Are you kidding?
You know cops can't read.

01:24:32.988 --> 01:24:35.742
What does "incompetent" mean?

01:24:35.825 --> 01:24:37.244
That mayor.

01:24:37.327 --> 01:24:41.292
He calls me at 2:00
in the morning.

01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:44.255
I don't answer
the phone anymore.

01:24:44.338 --> 01:24:47.134
What does "baffled" mean?

01:25:18.264 --> 01:25:21.769
Karen Joan Nash.

01:25:21.853 --> 01:25:24.774
Yeah, I remember her.

01:25:24.857 --> 01:25:27.278
I was practicing
in Syracuse.

01:25:27.361 --> 01:25:29.781
Didn't get many of these.

01:25:29.823 --> 01:25:31.325
What?

01:25:31.367 --> 01:25:32.786
Unwed mothers.

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:35.457
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

01:25:35.498 --> 01:25:38.545
Back then, in Syracuse...

01:25:38.628 --> 01:25:41.299
that was a stoning offense.

01:25:41.382 --> 01:25:42.968
What happened?

01:25:43.051 --> 01:25:46.265
She had the baby,
and she died.

01:25:46.348 --> 01:25:47.767
So Nash was illegitimate.

01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:50.437
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he was illegitimate...

01:25:50.521 --> 01:25:52.941
for about a minute and a half.

01:25:53.025 --> 01:25:55.320
He died right after she did.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.412
He died.

01:26:11.886 --> 01:26:12.763
Hello, Brenda.

01:26:12.846 --> 01:26:14.766
I did what you asked.

01:26:14.849 --> 01:26:18.647
I went through the deeds
to Nash's house...

01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:21.150
back through
five previous owners...

01:26:21.192 --> 01:26:24.197
to the original guy,
Montague, in 1796.

01:26:24.364 --> 01:26:25.699
In all five instances...

01:26:25.782 --> 01:26:26.826
Montague through Nash...

01:26:26.909 --> 01:26:28.370
I found a death certificate...

01:26:28.411 --> 01:26:30.498
for a kid with the same name...

01:26:30.581 --> 01:26:32.084
who died at birth...

01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:35.631
years before he pretended to sign
for his inheritance.

01:26:35.714 --> 01:26:38.927
Jesus, Rick, isn't there
any heat in here?

01:26:39.011 --> 01:26:41.765
No. Heat's bad
for the circuits.

01:26:41.848 --> 01:26:44.310
In case
there's any doubt...

01:27:04.633 --> 01:27:06.802
So, what you've
got here, Brenda...

01:27:06.886 --> 01:27:09.849
is a guy who's been
creeping around...

01:27:09.932 --> 01:27:11.518
since at least 1700...

01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:14.022
pretending to croak
every so often.

01:27:14.105 --> 01:27:15.524
Leaving all his goods...

01:27:15.607 --> 01:27:18.069
to kids who've been
corpses for years...

01:27:18.111 --> 01:27:20.531
and assuming
their identities.

01:27:25.915 --> 01:27:30.046
It's not possible.

01:27:30.129 --> 01:27:31.590
"Post" final!

01:27:31.673 --> 01:27:33.968
Cops release
headhunter picture!

01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:35.471
Reward offered.

01:27:35.512 --> 01:27:36.472
I'll take a "Post."

01:27:36.556 --> 01:27:38.183
Headhunter revealed!

01:28:11.859 --> 01:28:15.281
For you, my bonny Heather.

01:28:15.364 --> 01:28:17.367
Happy birthday.

01:28:19.412 --> 01:28:23.293
And you, Juan Ramirez.

01:28:23.376 --> 01:28:27.007
Take care of her,
you overdressed haggis.

01:28:42.405 --> 01:28:43.823
Ha ha ha.

01:28:43.907 --> 01:28:45.826
Ha ha ha.

01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:47.412
Ha ha ha.

01:28:52.253 --> 01:28:53.922
Ha ha ha.

01:29:03.436 --> 01:29:05.898
Kastagir is gone.

01:29:05.982 --> 01:29:08.444
Only you and I remain.

01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:18.876
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.046
Who cuts your hair?

01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:24.385
I am in disguise.

01:29:24.468 --> 01:29:28.224
This way no one
will recognize me.

01:29:30.644 --> 01:29:31.979
I do.

01:29:33.482 --> 01:29:35.443
What do you want?

01:29:35.526 --> 01:29:37.863
- Your head.
- Ha ha!

01:29:37.947 --> 01:29:39.824
And the prize.

01:29:40.868 --> 01:29:44.206
Ha ha. Watch.

01:29:44.290 --> 01:29:47.294
Happy Halloween, ladies!

01:29:47.336 --> 01:29:49.506
Blah, blah.

01:29:49.673 --> 01:29:51.133
Blah.

01:29:51.217 --> 01:29:54.012
Blah, blah, blah.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.937
Nuns. No sense of humor.

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:03.402
Ramirez's blade did not
cut deeply enough.

01:30:03.443 --> 01:30:07.074
He was right about you.
You're slime.

01:30:07.157 --> 01:30:09.369
Ramirez was an effete snob!

01:30:09.452 --> 01:30:11.831
He died on his knees!

01:30:11.914 --> 01:30:15.879
I took his head
and raped his woman...

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.217
before his blood
was even cold!

01:30:19.259 --> 01:30:21.011
Ha ha ha!

01:30:21.053 --> 01:30:23.557
Ha ha ha!

01:30:27.438 --> 01:30:29.399
I see.

01:30:29.441 --> 01:30:32.529
Ramirez lied.

01:30:34.991 --> 01:30:37.912
She was not his woman.

01:30:37.995 --> 01:30:40.082
She was your woman...

01:30:40.124 --> 01:30:43.963
and she never told you.

01:30:44.004 --> 01:30:46.508
I wonder why.

01:30:46.592 --> 01:30:48.970
Perhaps I gave her something...

01:30:49.054 --> 01:30:51.432
you never could...

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:57.942
and secretly she yearned
for my return.

01:30:57.984 --> 01:31:00.988
Holy ground, Highlander!

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:03.784
Remember what
Ramirez taught you.

01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:11.129
You can't stay
in here forever.

01:31:13.758 --> 01:31:15.969
You are weak, Highlander.

01:31:16.011 --> 01:31:21.895
You will always be
weaker than l.

01:31:25.692 --> 01:31:27.695
I'll be out front.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.871
Goodbye, Macleod.

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:37.835
We will meet soon enough.

01:31:41.508 --> 01:31:44.971
Ha ha ha!

01:31:45.055 --> 01:31:47.433
Ha ha ha ha!

01:31:47.517 --> 01:31:50.271
This is the house of God.

01:31:50.354 --> 01:31:52.608
People are trying to pray.

01:31:52.691 --> 01:31:54.235
You're disturbing them.

01:31:56.029 --> 01:32:00.453
He cares about
these helpless mortals?

01:32:00.536 --> 01:32:02.456
Of course he cares.

01:32:02.539 --> 01:32:04.960
He died for our sins.

01:32:05.043 --> 01:32:07.422
That shall be his undoing.

01:32:09.383 --> 01:32:11.887
Father...

01:32:11.970 --> 01:32:13.931
forgive me!

01:32:14.015 --> 01:32:16.978
I am a worm.

01:32:24.698 --> 01:32:26.617
Ha ha ha!

01:32:29.622 --> 01:32:32.334
I have something to say!

01:32:32.418 --> 01:32:34.588
It's better to burn out...

01:32:34.671 --> 01:32:37.383
than to fade away!

01:32:37.467 --> 01:32:38.802
Yah!

01:32:40.179 --> 01:32:42.141
Ha ha ha!

01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:43.643
Ha ha ha!

01:32:43.685 --> 01:32:45.395
Ha ha ha!

01:32:45.437 --> 01:32:47.232
I need to see him, goddamn it!

01:32:47.315 --> 01:32:49.193
I'm afraid that's impossible.

01:32:49.276 --> 01:32:51.154
Mr. Nash is--

01:32:51.238 --> 01:32:52.948
Mr. Nash is dead.

01:32:54.534 --> 01:32:57.580
What are you doing here?

01:32:57.622 --> 01:33:00.251
I'm looking for
a dead guy named Nash.

01:33:00.293 --> 01:33:02.463
He died at birth
in Syracuse, New York.

01:33:07.137 --> 01:33:09.807
All right.

01:33:09.849 --> 01:33:11.810
Come on.

01:33:38.893 --> 01:33:40.937
Are the Claymores real?

01:33:42.398 --> 01:33:43.858
What is this, a museum?

01:33:43.942 --> 01:33:46.446
This stuff
must be worth a fortune.

01:33:55.418 --> 01:33:58.965
I've been alive
for 4 1/2 centuries.

01:33:59.048 --> 01:34:00.884
I cannot die.

01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:03.221
Huh.

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:05.892
Well, everybody's
got their problems.

01:34:10.774 --> 01:34:14.571
What are you going
to do with that?

01:34:14.655 --> 01:34:16.199
Take it.

01:34:29.677 --> 01:34:33.934
I am Connor Macleod
of the Clan Macleod.

01:34:33.976 --> 01:34:36.146
I was born in 1518...

01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:38.149
in the village of Glenfinnan...

01:34:38.232 --> 01:34:40.652
on the shores of Loch Shiel...

01:34:40.736 --> 01:34:42.947
and I am immortal.

01:34:44.283 --> 01:34:46.119
Aah! Ohh!

01:34:46.161 --> 01:34:48.706
Ohh!

01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:50.250
Ohh!

01:36:22.723 --> 01:36:24.141
You're not listening.

01:36:24.225 --> 01:36:26.144
Brenda, it isn't going to work.

01:36:26.186 --> 01:36:28.147
I can't get involved.
Not again.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.961
You know what's weird?

01:36:43.003 --> 01:36:45.966
Most people are
afraid to die.

01:36:46.008 --> 01:36:48.470
That's not your problem.

01:36:49.346 --> 01:36:50.932
You're afraid to live.

01:36:56.023 --> 01:36:58.485
Take care of yourself.

01:36:58.568 --> 01:37:00.154
Don't lose your head.

01:37:16.053 --> 01:37:18.348
Hello, pretty.

01:37:18.431 --> 01:37:19.767
Ha!

01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:22.271
Ha ha ha!

01:37:22.354 --> 01:37:25.692
Come on!
Open up!

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.664
Oh, my!

01:37:37.043 --> 01:37:38.086
Aah!

01:37:54.194 --> 01:37:56.864
Ha ha ha!

01:37:56.948 --> 01:37:58.534
Have you ever
played chicken?

01:38:03.249 --> 01:38:05.127
Here we go!

01:38:05.168 --> 01:38:07.631
Ha ha ha!

01:38:07.714 --> 01:38:09.675
Watch out!

01:38:45.563 --> 01:38:47.482
Excuse me!
Ha ha ha!

01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:51.655
Oh, no!

01:39:09.766 --> 01:39:12.144
Watch out! A truck!

01:39:12.228 --> 01:39:14.189
Look out!

01:39:20.824 --> 01:39:21.992
Aah!

01:39:30.046 --> 01:39:33.885
* New York, New York *

01:39:33.969 --> 01:39:37.182
* I want to wake up *

01:39:37.224 --> 01:39:38.184
Shut up.

01:39:38.225 --> 01:39:40.270
* ln the city *

01:39:40.353 --> 01:39:42.064
Sing along--
* That never sleeps *

01:39:42.148 --> 01:39:44.318
Shut up!

01:39:44.401 --> 01:39:48.574
* To find I'm king of the hill *

01:39:48.658 --> 01:39:50.243
Aah!

01:39:50.327 --> 01:39:51.704
Shut up!

01:39:52.956 --> 01:39:55.501
Shut up!

01:39:55.585 --> 01:39:57.087
* And *

01:39:57.170 --> 01:39:59.466
* lf I can *

01:39:59.549 --> 01:40:02.094
* Make it there *

01:40:02.136 --> 01:40:06.601
* I'll make it anywhere *

01:40:06.643 --> 01:40:09.648
* It's up to you *

01:40:09.689 --> 01:40:11.358
* New York *

01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:15.156
* New *

01:40:15.239 --> 01:40:20.581
* York *

01:40:20.664 --> 01:40:22.584
* Ye-eah *

01:40:22.667 --> 01:40:24.587
* Ye-eah *

01:40:24.628 --> 01:40:26.631
* Ye-eah *

01:40:28.134 --> 01:40:31.055
Ha ha ha!

01:40:31.138 --> 01:40:32.474
* Yeah! **

01:40:32.515 --> 01:40:34.894
I can entertain myself.

01:40:34.977 --> 01:40:37.606
Your friend is a real screamer.
Listen.

01:40:37.690 --> 01:40:38.775
Aah! Uhh!

01:40:38.858 --> 01:40:42.197
Which part should
I cut off first?

01:40:42.238 --> 01:40:44.241
I'll be waiting.

01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:53.171
The endless killing
has driven him mad.

01:40:53.213 --> 01:40:55.675
Rachel, there are instructions
in the desk drawer.

01:40:55.717 --> 01:40:57.678
I want you to follow them.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.182
There's a power of attorney
for you.

01:41:00.224 --> 01:41:02.769
You'll have everything you need.

01:41:02.853 --> 01:41:04.689
You're not coming back.

01:41:05.732 --> 01:41:07.192
Even if you kill him...

01:41:07.234 --> 01:41:09.655
you're not coming back...

01:41:09.738 --> 01:41:10.948
are you?

01:41:19.711 --> 01:41:21.631
Sweet Rachel.

01:41:21.714 --> 01:41:25.470
You always knew
this would happen.

01:41:25.553 --> 01:41:27.890
Russell Nash dies tonight.

01:41:42.955 --> 01:41:46.460
Hey...
it's a kind of magic.

01:41:55.056 --> 01:41:57.268
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

01:42:34.866 --> 01:42:37.078
Aah!

01:43:30.158 --> 01:43:31.910
Aah!

01:44:20.442 --> 01:44:24.323
Aaah!

01:44:51.488 --> 01:44:53.241
Aaah!

01:45:50.953 --> 01:45:52.956
Aaah!

01:46:55.842 --> 01:46:57.678
Ha ha ha!

01:46:59.598 --> 01:47:01.100
Ha ha ha!

01:47:15.622 --> 01:47:18.084
So now it ends.

01:47:18.168 --> 01:47:19.712
Uhh!

01:47:26.555 --> 01:47:29.142
Ha ha ha!

01:47:29.226 --> 01:47:31.396
Ha ha ha!

01:47:31.438 --> 01:47:33.232
Yah!

01:47:36.278 --> 01:47:37.739
What kept you?

01:49:53.193 --> 01:49:55.780
There can be only one!

01:50:11.303 --> 01:50:12.972
Aah!

01:50:13.056 --> 01:50:14.558
Ohh!

01:50:14.642 --> 01:50:17.479
Ohh!

01:50:28.621 --> 01:50:31.542
The quickening overpowers me!

01:50:35.506 --> 01:50:38.511
I know!
I know everything!

01:50:38.678 --> 01:50:40.848
I am everything!

01:50:45.188 --> 01:50:47.650
Oh!

01:50:47.733 --> 01:50:49.319
Oh!

01:50:49.402 --> 01:50:50.487
Oh!

01:50:54.577 --> 01:50:56.496
Uh! Uh!

01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:57.999
Oh!

01:50:58.082 --> 01:51:00.085
Oh!

01:51:01.504 --> 01:51:03.423
Unh!

01:51:41.147 --> 01:51:43.817
this is where it all began.

01:51:43.901 --> 01:51:46.780
Can you tell me
about the prize?

01:51:46.864 --> 01:51:49.785
It's like a whirlwind
in my head.

01:51:49.827 --> 01:51:51.245
But if I concentrate...

01:51:51.329 --> 01:51:53.207
I know what people
are thinking...

01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:54.876
all over the world.

01:51:54.959 --> 01:51:56.086
Presidents...

01:51:56.169 --> 01:51:57.338
diplomats...

01:51:57.421 --> 01:51:59.049
scientists.

01:51:59.132 --> 01:52:02.053
I can help them
understand each other.

01:52:03.138 --> 01:52:04.390
What am I thinking?

01:52:04.474 --> 01:52:05.433
You're thinking...

01:52:05.517 --> 01:52:08.438
whether or not
you can love me.

01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:10.441
You can.
I'm just like you.

01:52:10.524 --> 01:52:12.444
I can love and
have children.

01:52:12.527 --> 01:52:14.363
Live and grow old.

01:52:14.447 --> 01:52:16.909
You never prepared
me for that...

01:52:16.951 --> 01:52:18.369
you Spanish peacock.

01:52:18.453 --> 01:52:20.080
Ha ha ha ha.

01:52:20.164 --> 01:52:22.250
Patience, Highlander.

01:52:22.334 --> 01:52:24.629
You have done well.

01:52:24.712 --> 01:52:26.841
But it'll take time.

01:52:26.924 --> 01:52:32.265
You are generations
being born and dying.

01:52:32.349 --> 01:52:34.769
You are at one
with all living things.

01:52:34.853 --> 01:52:38.149
Each man's thoughts and dreams
are yours to know.

01:52:39.777 --> 01:52:42.614
You have power beyond imagination.

01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:45.494
Use it well, my friend.

01:52:45.577 --> 01:52:47.622
Don't lose your head.

01:53:27.474 --> 01:53:28.976
* One dream *

01:53:29.018 --> 01:53:30.937
* One source *

01:53:30.979 --> 01:53:32.815
* One prize *

01:53:32.857 --> 01:53:34.442
* One goal *

01:53:34.526 --> 01:53:38.448
* One golden glance *

01:53:38.490 --> 01:53:41.954
* Of what should be *

01:53:42.037 --> 01:53:45.501
* One shine of light *

01:53:45.542 --> 01:53:49.465
* That shows the way *

01:53:49.507 --> 01:53:52.970
* No mortal man *

01:53:53.054 --> 01:53:56.976
* Can win this day *

01:53:57.060 --> 01:54:00.482
* The waiting seems *

01:54:00.565 --> 01:54:04.154
* Eternity *

01:54:04.195 --> 01:54:07.492
* The day will dawn *

01:54:07.534 --> 01:54:11.707
* On sanity *

01:54:11.748 --> 01:54:15.421
* ls this a kind *

01:54:15.504 --> 01:54:17.549
* Of magic? *

01:54:19.009 --> 01:54:24.726
* There can be only one *

01:54:26.521 --> 01:54:27.981
* This rage *

01:54:28.065 --> 01:54:30.151
* That lasts *

01:54:30.235 --> 01:54:33.448
* A thousand years *

01:54:33.531 --> 01:54:36.578
* Will soon be done *

01:54:52.059 --> 01:54:56.023
* This flame that burns *

01:54:56.107 --> 01:54:59.320
* lnside of me *

01:54:59.404 --> 01:55:01.699
* I'm hearing *

01:55:01.782 --> 01:55:07.040
* Secret harmonies *

01:55:07.124 --> 01:55:08.542
* The bell *

01:55:08.626 --> 01:55:10.545
* That rings *

01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:14.468
* lnside your mind *

01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:18.474
* ls charging *

01:55:18.516 --> 01:55:21.979
* The doors of time *

01:55:22.021 --> 01:55:25.484
* The waiting seems *

01:55:25.568 --> 01:55:29.115
* Eternity *

01:55:29.198 --> 01:55:32.662
* The day will dawn *

01:55:32.704 --> 01:55:36.459
* On sanity *

01:55:36.543 --> 01:55:38.504
* This is *

01:55:38.588 --> 01:55:40.549
* A kind *

01:55:40.591 --> 01:55:42.260
