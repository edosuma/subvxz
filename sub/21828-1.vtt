WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.834
-(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...
-No!

00:04.917 --> 00:06.208
Principal Grey had a box.

00:06.291 --> 00:07.667
All of her surveillance on me.

00:07.750 --> 00:10.041
-I'm adopted.
-Now we don't have any more secrets.

00:10.125 --> 00:13.208
(Ryan) It was Harper. It was Harper
behind the monsters the whole time!

00:13.291 --> 00:17.041
-(roaring)
-That robot always defeats my monsters,

00:17.125 --> 00:20.375
-so this time, I've planned accordingly.
-Oh, no...

00:20.458 --> 00:22.000
-(explosion)
-(Ryan) We were set up.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.208
He made it look like we're the villains.

00:24.291 --> 00:27.542
(Harper) Once my monster heart
hits that ooze, it's game over.

00:28.125 --> 00:31.500
(Ryan) All right, you heartless monster!
I believe that belongs to you.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.083
-(Mark) We did it!
-(Harris) The ooze is still out there.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.583
What if someone starts
using the ooze to make monsters?

00:37.667 --> 00:39.083
Then we'll do what we always do.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.625
We'll kick butt, as a team.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.917
(whirring)

00:50.417 --> 00:52.083
(Mech-X4 thuds)

00:52.166 --> 00:53.000
(wasp screeches)

00:54.166 --> 00:56.041
-(screeching)
-(thudding)

01:00.458 --> 01:02.417
Oh, no, son. You're not goin' anywhere.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.000
We gotta finish him off!

01:05.083 --> 01:06.500
Boss level missiles comin' up!

01:11.250 --> 01:12.750
(wasp buzzing)

01:14.542 --> 01:16.125
Moving too fast!
It dodged our missiles!

01:16.208 --> 01:18.959
Right! That's how Ryan blew up the school.

01:19.041 --> 01:21.250
-Me? Really?
-Mm-hmm.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.625
(buzzing)

01:24.709 --> 01:28.000
It's ghosting! We need our new weapon
that can blanket the area.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.542
Aah!

01:29.625 --> 01:31.375
Mark, whatever you're doing...

01:33.750 --> 01:36.792
Is done! I remain awesome.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.792
-(alarm blaring)
-Bringing the new tech online.

01:44.542 --> 01:46.875
-(Harris) Rerouting power.
-Sweet. Arming cold cannon.

01:46.959 --> 01:48.500
I did not agree to call it that.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.583
Set the cold cannon
to a wide spectrum beam.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.959
I never get to name the weapons.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.792
Let's see you dodge this.

02:13.417 --> 02:15.291
(wasp screeching)

02:16.750 --> 02:18.000
(screeches)

02:20.542 --> 02:22.542
(thudding)

02:24.542 --> 02:26.458
Okay! He's frozen!

02:26.542 --> 02:27.667
Finish it, bro!

02:38.208 --> 02:39.917
-Whoo!
-All right!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.417
Yes!

02:42.959 --> 02:46.083
(theme music playing)

03:18.583 --> 03:21.917
All right! After weeks of hunting,
we finally crushed that thing.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.375
The last loose end from Harper's plan.

03:24.458 --> 03:26.291
-(TV playing indistinctly)
-Uh, hey, guys.

03:26.375 --> 03:29.166
Godfrey's talking about Harper again.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.709
...now believes billionaire Seth Harper,

03:31.792 --> 03:34.500
who we now know
was behind the monster attacks,

03:34.583 --> 03:38.041
is now believed to have perished
in his battle with Mech-X4.

03:38.125 --> 03:41.417
Seth Harper, dead at 29.

03:42.291 --> 03:46.333
Twenty-nine. Even in death he's a lair.

03:46.417 --> 03:47.750
Man, Godfrey's the worst.

03:47.834 --> 03:50.125
But it's over. It's finally over.

03:50.959 --> 03:52.709
The guy who tried to destroy the city

03:52.792 --> 03:54.667
and waste us is gone.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.917
And best of all, tomorrow's
our first day at a new school!

04:00.375 --> 04:01.333
(clears throat)

04:01.417 --> 04:02.333
(sighs)

04:02.417 --> 04:04.625
I mean, uh, party bot, y'all!

04:04.709 --> 04:07.458
(electronic music playing)

04:07.542 --> 04:08.667
Why is that there?

04:19.959 --> 04:22.583
What's the point of blowing up your school

04:22.667 --> 04:24.625
if they're gonna send you
to a different one?

04:24.709 --> 04:27.917
(Harris) "Welcome Bay City High Rodents"?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.417
Um... that's an auspicious beginning.

04:30.500 --> 04:34.000
Guys, pfft. We saved the city.
We can handle a new school.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.375
And it's different this time.

04:35.458 --> 04:39.125
Sure, you guys are freshmen,
having another first day at a new school,

04:39.208 --> 04:41.333
where you're probably not gonna have
any new friends--

04:41.417 --> 04:42.875
Is this going anywhere?

04:42.959 --> 04:46.291
Yeah. But this time,
you know, we go in together.

04:46.375 --> 04:48.375
You guys have Mark Walker with you.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.750
Which means we are
Mark Walker by association.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.959
I feel taller already.

04:53.041 --> 04:56.667
Okay, we appreciate it, Mark,
but I think I got this.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.208
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.083
(school bell rings)

05:18.250 --> 05:20.333
Come on, man. I lost my report.

05:20.417 --> 05:22.375
It's due today!

05:23.500 --> 05:25.250
(music playing)

05:26.375 --> 05:27.542
Oh, no.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.166
It's broken.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.166
Stupid thing ate my money!

05:34.250 --> 05:35.834
I'm gonna eat its face!

05:35.917 --> 05:37.417
Oh, this is perfect.

05:38.834 --> 05:41.458
Um, do you mind if I--?
I'm kinda good with this stuff.

05:48.834 --> 05:51.917
-Thanks.
-Ryan. Ryan Walker.

05:54.375 --> 05:55.542
Ladies.

05:55.625 --> 05:56.625
Bold.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.041
(rattles)

06:02.166 --> 06:03.625
-(music playing)
-Here you go.

06:03.709 --> 06:05.500
Wow! You're awesome.

06:05.583 --> 06:08.542
Yeah. I am awesome!

06:18.500 --> 06:20.125
Uh, do you need help?

06:20.208 --> 06:21.458
From a Bay City High Rodent?

06:21.542 --> 06:24.500
Yeah, how about I shove you up the slot,
and you reach my snack for me?

06:24.583 --> 06:27.250
Ha! Or, um...

06:34.542 --> 06:35.750
What's you name, Bay City?

06:36.583 --> 06:38.709
-Ryan.
-That was cool, Ryan.

06:39.542 --> 06:40.709
Do it again.

06:41.542 --> 06:42.959
For everybody I know.

06:43.041 --> 06:44.083
Uh, okay.

06:47.875 --> 06:48.834
Have fun.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.667
Hey, that's our thing.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.583
Excuse me, uh, you gonna eat all that?

07:00.166 --> 07:02.291
Dang. Ryan's got it handled.

07:02.375 --> 07:04.375
As long as the principal
isn't a super-villain,

07:04.458 --> 07:05.709
piece of cake.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.375
Gum. Now.

07:07.458 --> 07:08.667
(spits)

07:08.750 --> 07:10.583
(sighs)

07:10.667 --> 07:13.583
You know, I didn't want
you Bay City kids here,

07:13.667 --> 07:15.417
but now that you are...

07:16.417 --> 07:19.250
you will follow the rules.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.458
He is a villain. I'll save you, gum.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.166
Spyder, not every school has a villain.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.709
(Veracity) What up, Dweeb Jobs?

07:28.792 --> 07:30.750
-Spoke too soon.
-Oh, do you go here now?

07:30.834 --> 07:32.959
That is perfect timing.
I needed a new assistant.

07:33.041 --> 07:35.709
Cute, Veracity.
The joke, not the wardrobe.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.250
-Do not go there.
-Fair. Too far.

07:42.542 --> 07:45.375
Why do you have a window
with government feed on it?

07:45.458 --> 07:48.250
Uh, I'm what they call
an "ethical hacker."

07:48.333 --> 07:50.166
Huh. That's not what I call you.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.041
Yeah, I get paid
to test people's security.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.709
A little something
I do between classes.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.667
Is that--? Is that the government feed
from Bay City High?

07:56.750 --> 07:59.041
-Yep.
-They're moving the ooze.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.792
Yeah, they're, uh, takin' it
to be destroyed by five.

08:01.875 --> 08:04.875
Just like me destroying you
in our kindergarten science fair.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.500
-Still bringin' that up.
-(bell rings)

08:06.583 --> 08:08.792
All right, well, it's been fun.

08:08.875 --> 08:12.291
Catch you on the shady side
of the bell curve, Ferris. Mmm.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.250
It's Harris! You know it's Harris!

08:14.333 --> 08:16.250
(exhales) Gotta find Ryan.

08:18.625 --> 08:22.291
-So, this is all of it?
-Yes, sir. All the tankers are full.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.458
The gel is ready to be processed
and neutralized.

08:24.542 --> 08:27.458
Good. Make sure everybody
is in position and be ready to roll.

08:27.542 --> 08:28.709
Yes, sir.

08:37.917 --> 08:38.917
Aah!

08:39.000 --> 08:39.917
(grunts, groans)

08:40.000 --> 08:42.250
(gasps) Aah!

08:50.667 --> 08:52.792
So you're saying
the military's moving the ooze?

08:52.875 --> 08:54.000
Today. All at once.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.291
Ry-Guy!

08:55.375 --> 08:57.792
Uh, dude whose name I don't know!
Sorry, you were saying?

08:57.875 --> 08:59.875
They're taking the ooze
to be destroyed at five.

08:59.959 --> 09:02.875
-That's good, right?
-Yeah, but if Harper's people are there,

09:03.000 --> 09:04.917
-they might try to steal it.
-That's bad, right?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.792
Yes. So Mech-X4 should
sit shotgun just to play it safe.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.792
-(Mark clears throat)
-Walker?

09:14.875 --> 09:15.709
Wade?

09:16.792 --> 09:19.542
-Lose the coat, newbie.
-That's one.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.750
You're wearing a varsity jacket,
you're not varsity here.

09:21.834 --> 09:22.667
Yet.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.959
I mean, I'm sure he'll try out and stuff.

09:28.583 --> 09:32.417
You're wearing the jacket of a school
so lame, a robot put it out of its misery.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.125
-That's two.
-Let's just, um, calm down, okay?

09:36.291 --> 09:39.166
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You gonna do your little, uh,

09:39.250 --> 09:41.000
zzt-zzt thing on this jerk? (laughs)

09:41.083 --> 09:42.375
-(stamps foot)
-(whimpers)

09:42.458 --> 09:44.417
No, dude, lose the jacket.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.041
What? You're taking their side?

09:46.125 --> 09:48.542
It's just a jacket, dude.
You can still wear it to sleep.

09:49.875 --> 09:51.834
That was just for state finals, okay?

09:51.917 --> 09:54.417
-I'm not discussing this with you--
-Hey, we're not done here.

09:54.500 --> 09:58.083
-Okay, that is three!
-Guys, let's just, um, calm down, okay?

09:58.166 --> 10:01.083
Don't you remember the time
with the free snacks?

10:01.166 --> 10:03.834
Come on, guys.
This doesn't have to turn into a fight.

10:03.917 --> 10:06.041
-(Spyder) Fight!
-Come on.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.542
(grunting)

10:09.834 --> 10:12.000
I'm sorry. I heard fight.
Are we not fighting?

10:12.083 --> 10:13.166
We are now!

10:13.250 --> 10:14.333
(Ryan) Hey, guys! Guys!

10:14.417 --> 10:16.291
(grunting)

10:16.375 --> 10:17.959
Please don't hurt my brain!

10:18.041 --> 10:20.500
(Principal) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

10:20.583 --> 10:24.250
That's enough. That is enough!
That is enough!

10:25.834 --> 10:27.083
Who started this?

10:27.166 --> 10:29.000
-Him!
-That's not true!

10:29.083 --> 10:30.375
You're dead, little Walker.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.417
Oh, great, now I'm back
to being "little Walker."

10:32.500 --> 10:35.792
Okay, well, you can cancel
all your after-school plans.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.166
Well, we got practice.

10:37.250 --> 10:40.583
No. No, no, no. Not you guys. No, no, no.

10:41.542 --> 10:42.792
Just these new kids.

10:45.291 --> 10:46.709
-Get back over here.
-Oh.

10:46.792 --> 10:50.583
Yeah. There you go. On your way.

10:54.250 --> 10:58.250
Hey, Big Jay. I love the new kicks.
What are those?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.959
So this is what detention is like.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.333
Does this make me a bad boy?

11:11.417 --> 11:13.250
I don't know, are you doing math
in your head now?

11:13.333 --> 11:14.500
Just some light calculus.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.750
You're not a bad boy. Mm-mm-mm.

11:16.834 --> 11:18.375
Shh!

11:18.458 --> 11:20.750
I can't believe you took their side.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.709
We're supposed to be a team.

11:22.792 --> 11:24.083
I was winning them over,

11:24.166 --> 11:25.875
you blew it because of some
stupid jacket.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.750
It's not about the jacket.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.667
It's about what the jacket means.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.375
It means a bunch of varsity jerks

11:33.458 --> 11:35.250
on my case at this school,
too, so thank you.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.375
Shh!

11:36.458 --> 11:38.375
Hey, you can vision board
your feelings later.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.166
It's 4:30. The ooze is leaving soon.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.709
Shh!

11:42.667 --> 11:44.792
(helicopter whirring)

11:44.875 --> 11:47.041
(voices chattering)

12:00.500 --> 12:01.875
All right, listen up.

12:01.959 --> 12:04.166
It's a two-hour drive
from here to Fort Matthews.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.333
No stops. No bathroom breaks.

12:06.417 --> 12:09.250
We start the engines, we drive,
we hand the stuff over,

12:09.333 --> 12:11.000
and we never see it again.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.041
You got it?

12:12.834 --> 12:15.291
All right, then. Let's roll out!

12:30.709 --> 12:32.041
All right, detention's over.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.834
-(crackles, pops)
-(shrieks)

12:35.917 --> 12:37.458
Oh, my goodness. Did that explode?

12:37.542 --> 12:40.375
I read about this,
and you should really see a nurse.

12:42.333 --> 12:43.750
I'll be back.

12:43.834 --> 12:46.250
Nobody leaves until five. I'm serious.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.375
Let's bolt.

12:51.208 --> 12:54.291
-You are a bad boy.
-And I like it!

12:55.250 --> 12:56.834
All right, we gotta move.

12:56.917 --> 12:59.417
Oh, "we." What, we're a team now?

12:59.500 --> 13:00.917
Oh! Incoming!

13:07.208 --> 13:09.000
Oh!

13:09.083 --> 13:11.542
Oh, no. Are you okay?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.625
Yeah, I'm all right.

13:19.792 --> 13:22.083
I-- I am so sorry.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.542
-It's okay.
-Really?

13:23.625 --> 13:25.250
Yeah, I got another pair in my office.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.917
Okay. It's here. It's just right...

13:27.000 --> 13:29.208
-Right over, right up there.
-Oh...

13:29.291 --> 13:30.417
-There we go.
-Okay.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.083
-Good.
-Everything's just a little blurry.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.875
(Veracity) You're good. You're good.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.041
All right.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.458
You're helping us?

13:41.542 --> 13:45.917
That Wade kid, like, lied, and you
getting detention just wasn't fair,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.375
and I don't do unfair, and besides...

13:50.458 --> 13:52.333
now you owe me one.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.041
-Mm.
-Bites for you, doesn't it, huh, Sparky?

13:55.125 --> 13:56.959
-(sneering)
-(Veracity giggling)

13:57.041 --> 13:59.041
Ooh, you guys gonna
go to prom, get a limo?

13:59.125 --> 14:00.875
-Inappropriate.
-Let's go.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.166
How we lookin', Lieutenant?

14:14.250 --> 14:15.834
No one following.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.291
Nothin' on radar, sir.

14:18.375 --> 14:19.917
Good.

14:33.792 --> 14:36.041
Ah. Wow. Stealth mode rocks.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.250
Yeah, you're welcome.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.792
Uh, guys?

14:55.875 --> 14:57.834
One of the trucks
isn't following the others.

14:57.917 --> 15:00.041
-It's peeling away.
-It's being hijacked.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.875
See? Someone does wanna make monsters.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.041
-Can I shoot it?
-No.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.709
Someone's inside there.
We have to figure out what they're up to.

15:05.792 --> 15:09.041
Well, whoever it is,
I'm in the mood to kick some butt.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.125
Yeah. Me too.

15:23.875 --> 15:24.709
Beep.

15:37.542 --> 15:38.792
Oh!

15:49.458 --> 15:51.125
(sighs) Almost.

15:52.792 --> 15:55.583
Weird. Somebody drove that truck in there,

15:55.667 --> 15:57.917
but I'm not picking up
anyone on my scanners.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.041
Then we're gonna
have go down there and find him.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.333
Hang on. Okay, Nerdo just said,

16:03.417 --> 16:05.250
he didn't see anyone on the scanners.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.959
Something weird is going on.
We need to come up with a plan.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.375
You know, like a team?

16:09.458 --> 16:12.125
I beat monsters.
I'm not afraid of some guy.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.625
If you wanna stay, that's fine.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.583
(Ryan) I'm gonna go see
what's goin' on in that barn.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.625
This is a bad idea.

16:34.208 --> 16:36.000
(whispering) Psst! Where's your weapon?

16:36.875 --> 16:37.834
I am a weapon.

16:56.542 --> 16:57.750
(Ryan) Come on out!

17:01.333 --> 17:04.083
(engine idling)

17:18.333 --> 17:21.875
Okay, dude. Let's not make
this harder than it has to be.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.458
Just give up.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.250
Grey?

17:32.583 --> 17:36.000
That's right. Back from the dead!

17:41.250 --> 17:44.041
I don't know how you survived,
but you're outmatched.

17:45.917 --> 17:48.083
So just be a nice little villain
and surrender.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.458
(growling)

17:55.333 --> 17:56.583
(growling)

18:09.959 --> 18:10.959
(groans)

18:11.041 --> 18:13.250
(roaring)

18:17.834 --> 18:19.458
How are you doing that?

18:19.542 --> 18:22.041
Hmm, just a happy little accident

18:22.125 --> 18:24.917
after you let me fall in Clawboon's ooze.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.208
-I tried to save you!
-You failed!

18:27.291 --> 18:29.875
But you're not the only one
with powers now.

18:30.834 --> 18:35.625
I could snap you in half with my claws.

18:35.709 --> 18:39.792
But, Ryan, I'm going
to take my time with you.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.125
Your mistake.

18:44.834 --> 18:47.959
-This fight ends differently, Ryan.
-(grunting)

18:48.041 --> 18:51.125
You've had this beat-down
coming for a long time.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.750
Get off of him!

18:52.834 --> 18:54.333
(electrical crackling)

18:55.166 --> 18:57.125
(grunts)

19:01.250 --> 19:03.291
(grunts)

19:07.917 --> 19:09.959
-Fine. You first.
-No. Don't!

19:10.041 --> 19:11.667
(grunts)

19:18.959 --> 19:22.083
Nobody move!
We know that you have the ooze!

19:24.208 --> 19:26.000
This is just the beginning.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.166
(growling)

19:33.417 --> 19:36.250
(pounding footsteps)

19:48.625 --> 19:51.125
We gotta get outta here
before they see us.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.083
-(Mark) She's gone?
-(Harris) So is the ooze!

19:54.166 --> 19:55.500
(Mark) Where'd she go?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.709
Aw, sweet! Ice packs.

20:10.792 --> 20:11.750
What flavor's mine?

20:11.834 --> 20:14.959
-You haven't been eatin' those, have you?
-No, of course-- of course not.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.667
From now on.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.750
I can't believe it. Grey's back.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.333
-With powers.
-Yeah, how did that happen?

20:23.417 --> 20:25.041
You got dunked into the ooze, too.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.750
It just made you into an uncontrollable,

20:27.834 --> 20:30.750
like, slobbering, gross, really murdery--

20:30.834 --> 20:33.083
Okay, we get it, we get it.
You know, she did fall

20:33.166 --> 20:35.083
into the ooze that was
electrified by our X-weapon.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.792
That could've changed
the monster-making properties.

20:37.875 --> 20:41.625
Which would explain
why the robot couldn't find her.

20:41.709 --> 20:43.375
I was scanning for a human.

20:43.458 --> 20:47.166
-I'll bet at the molecular--
-All this science is really interesting--

20:47.250 --> 20:48.875
No, it's not.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.959
But what is she up to? What does she want?

20:51.041 --> 20:52.375
And-- And how do we beat her?

20:52.458 --> 20:53.667
The same way we did last time.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.083
By dropping her to her death?

20:55.166 --> 20:56.875
-No.
-Oh...

20:56.959 --> 20:58.667
By having each other's backs.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.458
Like I should've had yours today.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.166
I'm sorry, man.

21:05.375 --> 21:06.500
Are we cool?

21:08.875 --> 21:10.542
Frosty.

21:10.625 --> 21:12.959
Good. 'Cause when we're a team,

21:13.041 --> 21:14.667
there's nothing that we can't handle.

21:27.458 --> 21:30.083
Welcome... to Mech-X4.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.792
No way.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.166
(growling)

21:54.041 --> 21:55.875
All right! Let's do this!

21:56.625 --> 21:59.959
He's always saying "Let's do this."
You notice that?

22:00.041 --> 22:01.792
Yeah, it pumps up the team.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.125
Guys? We can hear you.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.959
Oh. Um...

22:06.667 --> 22:08.041
Let's do this!

22:27.375 --> 22:29.291
Do they seriously just chat
during battles?

22:29.375 --> 22:30.709
How are you still alive?

22:30.792 --> 22:32.166
You'll get it eventually.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.625
(theme music playing)

22:58.959 --> 23:00.375
(barks)
