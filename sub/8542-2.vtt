[papers rustling]

00:07.790 --> 00:11.968
Oh, your, uh...identification.

00:12.055 --> 00:16.799
Congratulations. You are once
again a consultant for the CBI.

00:16.886 --> 00:19.497
Thank you.
What about Lisbon?

00:19.584 --> 00:21.978
Agent Lisbon
remains on suspension

00:22.065 --> 00:23.414
pending departmental
investigation

00:23.501 --> 00:26.983
of her actions
in the Red John matter.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.941
'You'll be working with..'

00:29.029 --> 00:30.769
Ray Haffner from now on.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.946
He's an excellent agent.
Top-flight team.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.427
- You're dumping her.
- Not at all.

00:36.514 --> 00:41.780
Uh, we're conducting a careful
and scrupulously fair review.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.869
You're rehiring me
and you're firing Lisbon.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.220
That's a little...perverse,
don't you think?

00:46.307 --> 00:48.265
No, see, you close cases.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.311
Agent Lisbon ran a covert
operation that led

00:50.398 --> 00:53.531
to the deaths of two police
officers and one FBI agent.

00:53.618 --> 00:56.056
There just has to be
some accountability there.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.145
My operation.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.885
That was my operation.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.844
'Well, that's
exactly the problem.'

01:01.931 --> 01:04.368
'We expect better supervision
from our senior agents'

01:04.455 --> 01:06.544
which is why Lisbon
is being investigated

01:06.631 --> 01:09.460
and her team reassigned
to other posts.

01:09.547 --> 01:13.464
Uh, Haffner and his team
already caught another case.

01:13.551 --> 01:16.206
Here's the address.
You can hit the ground running.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.600
No, I don't think so.

01:18.687 --> 01:21.472
No? What-what do you mean?

01:21.559 --> 01:22.865
Just what I said.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.695
I'll get right on this.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.355
[indistinct chattering on radio]

01:34.442 --> 01:36.661
- Jane, right?
- Yup.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.315
- Ray Haffner.
- Hi.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.839
I'm-I'm hoping we can
jump in and do the job.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.102
- Sound good?
- Sure.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.712
Great.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.975
'This is Patrick Jane.
Jane, this is Rick Tork.'

01:46.062 --> 01:47.368
- How are you?
- Hi.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.934
- Anthony Niskin.
- Nice to meet you.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.197
- Hi.
- And Ed Masterson.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.721
- Hello. Hi.
- Yeah.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.810
[indistinct chattering on radio]

01:54.897 --> 01:57.378
- I'll just..
- Absolutely.

01:57.465 --> 02:00.816
[Masterson]
'The victim's name
is Markus Kuzmenko.'

02:00.903 --> 02:03.993
'Got hit with something heavy
on the left side of his head.'

02:04.080 --> 02:06.300
'No sign of the murder weapon.'

02:06.387 --> 02:08.693
May I? Thank you.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.174
[Masterson]
'Gardener found the body
when he came today.'

02:11.261 --> 02:13.655
Coroner says it happened
around 11 last night.

02:13.742 --> 02:15.439
Haven't found any witnesses.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.053
Jane?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.185
Hmm?

02:22.272 --> 02:23.578
Any thoughts?

02:23.665 --> 02:24.840
Yeah.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.628
"The years teach us patience.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.152
"The shorter our time,
the greater

02:32.239 --> 02:34.980
our capacity for waiting."

02:35.067 --> 02:37.069
That's pretty deep.
Is it Buddha?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.680
Elizabeth Taylor.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.986
This man's dead.
I'm all but certain of it.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.297
What?

02:47.384 --> 02:48.690
[sighs]
Alright then.

02:49.517 --> 02:52.389
[theme music]

03:00.310 --> 03:01.920
Thank you.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.013
Mmm.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.493
How's the arm?

03:09.580 --> 03:11.669
Better. Yeah, physical
therapy's helping.

03:11.756 --> 03:12.714
Good.

03:12.801 --> 03:14.890
[sighs]

03:14.977 --> 03:16.805
Tell me, uh

03:16.892 --> 03:19.982
what do you know about
this guy Ray Haffner?

03:20.069 --> 03:21.766
You're back at work?

03:21.853 --> 03:24.465
Yeah, you know,
just consulting.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.338
Haffner, uh..

03:28.425 --> 03:30.775
...word is he's tough,
by the book.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.255
I think he started out

03:32.342 --> 03:34.388
in the FBI organized
crime division.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.216
He had a couple
of high-profile busts

03:36.303 --> 03:39.828
using wiretaps and creative
surveillance techniques.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.177
Surveillance, huh?

03:41.264 --> 03:43.179
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.485
Why do you wanna know?

03:44.572 --> 03:47.009
Eh, just curious.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.881
- Oh.
- Can I take this?

03:49.968 --> 03:51.753
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, new case.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.756
I, uh, I gotta man the phones,
hit the sidewalk.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.801
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, I know.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.107
- Thanks for coming by.
- Pleasure.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.065
Yeah.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.677
Just so you know,
Jane, I'm okay.

04:02.764 --> 04:03.808
About?

04:03.895 --> 04:05.332
Losing my job.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.159
I'm not gonna say
I like it

04:07.247 --> 04:10.293
but we got Red John.
It was worth it.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.774
Don't be silly.
A, you haven't lost your job.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.515
The hearing's a formality.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.734
And B, we didn't
get Red John.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.824
Timothy Carter told
you he was Red John.

04:19.911 --> 04:20.912
He lied.

04:20.999 --> 04:21.957
'Carter must've known him'

04:22.044 --> 04:23.524
because he told me things that

04:23.611 --> 04:25.526
only my wife and daughter's
killer could know.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.918
But he's not the man.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.356
- That man's still out there.
- Jane.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.967
Someone told that security
guard to take Carter's gun

04:32.054 --> 04:34.491
and phone, then killed him.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.754
Who would do that
besides Red John?

04:36.841 --> 04:39.017
Ergo, Timothy Carter
is not Red John.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.324
Carter had to have known
there was a possibility

04:41.411 --> 04:43.370
you'd kill him.
You always said you would.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.894
So maybe he asked
a guard to take the gun

04:45.981 --> 04:47.722
and the cell phone
if you did.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.245
- Why?
- To mess with your head.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.594
And it's working.

04:50.681 --> 04:53.031
You're looking for a man
you already killed.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.598
Carter's wife is in custody.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.861
- 'She said anything?'
- Nothing.

04:56.948 --> 04:59.168
When she does talk,
you know what she'll say?

04:59.255 --> 05:01.562
That you shot
and killed Red John.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.433
Good for you.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.087
No.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.131
Thanks for the tea.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.219
What do you mean?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.352
Uh, lovely to see you.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.875
Keep working that bum wing.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.839
Keys, change, anything metal.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.841
Thank you.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.104
[Rigsby]
Thanks.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.584
- Jane.
- New assignment?

05:23.671 --> 05:26.108
Just temporary.
Security's shorthanded.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.892
At least that's
what they tell me.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.721
Cho got a call today. Not sure
where they're putting him.

05:30.808 --> 05:33.942
Grace is still waiting to hear.
At least we still have jobs.

05:36.988 --> 05:38.860
You, uh, talk to Lisbon?

05:38.947 --> 05:39.948
Uh, yes.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.906
We're gonna have a..

05:41.993 --> 05:43.473
...a little secret
meeting later.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.432
- Tell Cho and Van Pelt.
- Secret meeting?

05:45.519 --> 05:47.825
- About what?
- I'll tell you then.

05:50.524 --> 05:51.481
Keys.

05:51.568 --> 05:54.441
[instrumental music]

06:05.365 --> 06:08.933
Hey, Tork, you're still
20 short on Tuesday's dinner.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.892
Man up, my brother.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.589
Yeah.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.247
Jane, heard you used
to be in the circus.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.206
- Is that right?
- Well, um, not exactly.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.258
I like your shoes.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.434
Yeah.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.480
Hey.

06:33.567 --> 06:36.134
I doubt Niskin meant
anything, by the way.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.484
What do you mean?

06:37.571 --> 06:40.487
"You're short." "Man up."

06:40.574 --> 06:43.272
I don't think
he was referring to..

06:43.359 --> 06:44.316
No.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.709
I mean..

06:49.147 --> 06:50.322
...no.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.936
What have we got on the victim?

06:55.023 --> 06:58.592
Kuzmenko was a naturalized
citizen originally from Estonia.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.985
Was a swimmer on
the Estonian National Swim Team

07:01.072 --> 07:04.293
came over to the US 2002,
no family here.

07:04.380 --> 07:07.122
Stop playing with that little
ball. You're driving me crazy.

07:07.209 --> 07:10.647
[Masterson]
He worked as a personal trainer
at a gym called Work-It.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.475
'Got his picture
off their web site.'

07:12.562 --> 07:16.131
I know that gym.
A lot of bigwigs work out there.

07:16.218 --> 07:19.482
Hey. Jane.

07:19.569 --> 07:22.137
Your thing's reading people.
What's this guy say to you?

07:22.224 --> 07:24.487
I'd guess he was a narcissist

07:24.574 --> 07:26.446
and a serial seducer.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.796
How do you get that?

07:28.883 --> 07:30.362
A jock with manicured nails

07:30.450 --> 07:32.582
too much cologne,
too tight of pants

07:32.669 --> 07:34.845
and he drives
a 20-year-old muscle car.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.806
Okay. We'll see
if that's useful.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.461
Masterson, you and Tork, you
cover Kuzmenko's neighborhood.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.159
Niskin, you run his
phone and e-mails.

07:44.246 --> 07:48.250
- I'll cover the gym.
- I'll go with you.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.556
Sure. You can come.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.993
Agent Haffner,
you asked to see me?

07:52.080 --> 07:55.126
Yeah, Cho, let's talk in my
office. Meet you at the gym.

07:58.608 --> 07:59.914
Sit down.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.440
I saw your old team member
downstairs...Rigsby?

08:06.268 --> 08:09.053
- 'That's tough.'
- I guess.

08:09.140 --> 08:12.622
I know your reputation, Cho.
I read your file.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.450
'You're a good cop'

08:14.537 --> 08:17.584
but this Red John thing
really pissed Bertram off.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.499
Puts you in a bad spot.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.287
- What's your take on Jane?
- What do you mean?

08:25.374 --> 08:28.116
- You trust him?
- 'Depends.'

08:28.203 --> 08:29.770
Think he's smarter than you?

08:29.857 --> 08:31.728
Yes.

08:31.815 --> 08:34.862
- Think he's smarter than me?
- Yes.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.341
You're probably right.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.387
I read Jane's file.
I know what'll happen.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.258
He's gonna go behind my back..

08:40.345 --> 08:42.565
...lie to me,
run a scam on me, right?

08:42.652 --> 08:45.046
- Pretty much.
- 'He's also gonna close cases.'

08:45.133 --> 08:47.309
I get that too.
I can work with Jane.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.659
I just need some help

08:49.746 --> 08:52.793
'someone who knows him, someone
who can tell me what's going on'

08:52.880 --> 08:55.099
warn me when something's coming.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.927
'I'm not talking about
betraying a confidence.'

08:57.014 --> 08:59.495
- I wanna be kept in the loop.
- What's the difference?

08:59.582 --> 09:01.802
You help me, you're
at your desk working cases.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.543
You don't, you're
downstairs working the lobby

09:03.630 --> 09:06.154
with your pal Rigsby.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.156
Where doyouwant to be?

09:09.636 --> 09:11.072
Here.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.639
'Glad to hear it.'

09:13.814 --> 09:14.902
Here's the case file.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.122
Good to have you aboard, Cho.

09:18.209 --> 09:21.125
[intense music]

09:28.002 --> 09:30.744
[phone ringing]

09:30.831 --> 09:33.921
Oh. Just admiring your son.
He as tall as you?

09:34.008 --> 09:36.097
No, no.
He's just nine years old.

09:36.184 --> 09:39.361
Right. So, what, he's
about, uh, Tork's size?

09:39.448 --> 09:42.364
[Niskin laughing]

09:45.236 --> 09:47.674
[laughing]
No, man. No,
Tork's not that short.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.893
No, my little man's probably
about, like, right here.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.855
[Niskin laughing]

10:06.040 --> 10:06.954
Hey.

10:08.825 --> 10:12.133
Was Niskin just
talking about me?

10:12.220 --> 10:14.396
Yeah, I-I gotta make
an important phone call.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.530
Son of a bitch.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.711
Hi. I need some help
locating a special item.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.413
Gym's owner is Jocelyn Chapin.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.197
If you don't mind,
I'll take lead.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.896
- Lead. Sure.
- Good.

10:35.983 --> 10:36.897
Ms. Chapin?

10:38.333 --> 10:40.988
Ms. Chapin, hi.
Agent Ray Haffner, CBI.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.424
This is Patrick Jane.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.948
- He's a consultant.
- Hi.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.863
- I can't believe what happened.
- I understand.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.691
How long had
Kuzmenko worked here?

10:48.778 --> 10:51.999
Uh, almost nine years.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.305
He started here
when he got to the US.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.307
- He get along with people?
- Yeah, everybody.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.962
Markus was a real people person,
just charming.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.703
You couldn't say no to him.

11:00.790 --> 11:04.141
So was he having any
troubles recently or..

11:04.228 --> 11:06.187
Not that I know of. Uh..

11:06.274 --> 11:07.275
Um..

11:07.362 --> 11:08.842
[weights clanking]

11:08.929 --> 11:10.670
- Mike.
- Yeah?

11:10.757 --> 11:13.020
This-this is Mike Villanueva.
He and Markus were friends.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.717
These are, uh, agents from CBI.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.501
Oh. Oh, it's crazy, huh?

11:16.588 --> 11:18.025
Yeah, we're all
pretty racked up..

11:18.112 --> 11:21.158
Yeah, did Markus mention
any other difficulties

11:21.245 --> 11:23.378
that he was having,
money, other issues?

11:23.465 --> 11:26.120
No. No, he was doing great.

11:26.207 --> 11:30.167
Ooh. Feeling that. Yeah.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.214
- We boring you, Jane?
- Nope. Not at all.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.825
[grunts]

11:35.912 --> 11:37.566
[clanks]

11:37.653 --> 11:38.959
Sorry.

11:39.046 --> 11:42.005
I thought you were
taking lead on this.

11:42.092 --> 11:46.096
How many clients was
Kuzmenko sleeping with?

11:46.183 --> 11:48.969
- Excuse me?
- You said he was charming.

11:49.056 --> 11:52.102
Good-looker. He must've
had his pick of the bunch.

11:52.189 --> 11:55.802
I, uh, I gotta get
back to my client now.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.282
Uh, I have a firm
policy against that.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.762
Doesn't answer the question.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.546
Listen, a lot
of prominent people

12:01.633 --> 12:03.766
come here, alright?

12:03.853 --> 12:07.204
Politicians,
politicians' wives

12:07.291 --> 12:08.815
and frankly, they
expect some discretion.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.992
Yeah, we don't really care.
Answer his question.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.951
Yeah, I-I heard rumors about
Markus and some of his clients.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.518
If they were true, I would've

12:16.605 --> 12:18.825
had to fire him.
I didn't wanna do that.

12:18.912 --> 12:22.045
Markus was the most
successful trainer that we had

12:22.132 --> 12:24.656
so I-I didn't ask.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.528
I don't have any names.

12:26.615 --> 12:27.790
Except your own.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.879
Yeah.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.272
Yeah, a long time ago

12:31.359 --> 12:34.057
very, very briefly,
Markus and I had a thing.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.755
A thing?

12:35.842 --> 12:38.627
Nothing serious.

12:38.714 --> 12:42.892
- We were friends.
- Oh. Okay.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.460
I'm gonna need the names
of all of Kuzmenko's clients.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.648
[instrumental music]

13:01.084 --> 13:02.216
Hi.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.088
Lovely rings you have.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.568
Thanks.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.178
Expensive, I expect.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.093
Your husband must
be very generous.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.095
Yeah. Do you mind?

13:15.316 --> 13:17.274
Just, uh, one more thing.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.015
Markus Kuzmenko

13:19.102 --> 13:21.626
more of a gentle lover
or a brute?

13:21.713 --> 13:23.541
[woman grunts]

13:23.628 --> 13:26.066
[female #1]
'Oh! Are you alright?'

13:26.153 --> 13:27.894
- You okay?
- Man down!

13:27.981 --> 13:29.678
[door opening]

13:30.505 --> 13:31.811
[door closes]

13:37.686 --> 13:39.427
Your Mr. Jane,
how did he know?

13:39.514 --> 13:42.082
Your eyes were puffy.
He could tell you'd been crying.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.867
Does my husband have
to find out about this?

13:44.954 --> 13:46.303
Depends on what you say.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.088
[sighs]

13:49.916 --> 13:52.266
It happened
a few months back.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.573
Markus was coming
by my house once a week

13:55.660 --> 13:58.054
to work on my abs.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.317
He was so funny and charming

14:00.404 --> 14:03.668
with a faintly...wicked quality.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.759
Amoral, you know what I mean?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.718
Unaware of moral precepts

14:09.805 --> 14:11.241
as opposed
to being purposely bad.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.113
'It can be a very
attractive quality.'

14:14.288 --> 14:16.638
My husband's not like that.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.249
Amoral, I mean.

14:19.336 --> 14:23.166
Markus never hit on me.
I think I seduced him.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.125
How long did
the relationship last?

14:26.822 --> 14:29.216
Twice.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.913
Markus wasn't a relationship.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.698
If it was a just a fling
a couple months back

14:33.785 --> 14:35.918
why were you crying
this morning?

14:36.005 --> 14:38.616
He's dead.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.053
It's sad.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.754
Your phone records show
Markus called you last week.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.538
'You sure
the relationship was over?'

14:47.625 --> 14:49.410
Um..

14:49.497 --> 14:51.499
...Markus said that
he had a business venture

14:51.586 --> 14:55.068
he wanted to talk to my husband
and me about investing in.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.852
[sighs]
It didn't occur to him that

14:56.939 --> 14:58.549
that would be
an awkward conversation.

14:58.636 --> 14:59.986
What was the business?

15:00.073 --> 15:01.291
I don't know.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.293
I told him
we couldn't discuss it.

15:06.035 --> 15:09.256
[sighs]
So what about my husband?

15:09.343 --> 15:12.302
There's a pretty good chance
we won't need to talk to him.

15:12.389 --> 15:15.088
I'd hate for him
to have to find out

15:15.175 --> 15:17.133
although a little bit,
I wish he would.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.530
- Should we keep an eye on her?
- She seemed sincere to me.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.967
Eh, she's a timid
suburban adulteress.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.490
The only thing
she's killed lately

15:26.577 --> 15:27.883
is a bottle of chardonnay.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.058
[indistinct chattering on radio]

15:29.145 --> 15:32.540
Niskin! You think this is funny?

15:32.627 --> 15:34.324
What do you mean?

15:34.411 --> 15:37.371
I just found these
on my desk with a note.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.200
"Tork, try theselifts."
That funny to you?

15:40.287 --> 15:42.506
[laughing]
I got nothing
to do with that, man.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.378
I wear lifts,
so I'm a joke?

15:44.465 --> 15:46.162
I don't know
about your lifts

15:46.249 --> 15:48.773
but, yes, these are
real funny, man.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.688
[both grunting]

15:50.775 --> 15:52.473
[shattering]

15:52.560 --> 15:54.083
[both grunting]

15:54.170 --> 15:55.955
- Come on, come on.
- Help.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.261
- Break it up!
- My money's on the little guy.

16:04.267 --> 16:07.792
I was engaged
to this guy, Craig.

16:07.879 --> 16:10.143
You know, he seemed
like a good person.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.753
We were happy.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.322
Then I found out
that he was an assassin

16:15.409 --> 16:18.412
for a serial killer
named Red John

16:18.499 --> 16:21.676
and he tried to...kill me

16:21.763 --> 16:23.895
and some other people, so..

16:23.983 --> 16:26.333
I had to shoot him.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.945
Tell me, how it does
it feel telling that

16:30.032 --> 16:32.600
recounting it?

16:32.687 --> 16:35.777
Not good. Pretty bad.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.258
Can you elaborate?

16:38.345 --> 16:41.043
Can I ask, how long does
this therapy usually last?

16:41.130 --> 16:43.306
'It depends.
There's no set calendar.'

16:44.699 --> 16:47.571
I'm sensing
hesitation on your part.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.139
I guess..

16:50.226 --> 16:52.924
...I just don't believe
that this will really work.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.926
Talking about it.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.320
What's the point?

16:57.407 --> 17:01.237
Grace, somebody you trusted
and loved betrayed you

17:01.324 --> 17:04.719
betrayed you so badly,
you had to take his life.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.590
That needs to be talked about.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.638
[chuckles]
It could've been worse.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.380
I could've married him.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.426
[cell phone ringing]

17:16.513 --> 17:18.776
No phone calls during session.
That's a rule.

17:18.863 --> 17:22.258
It's work. I gotta take this.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.304
Sorry.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.828
Van Pelt.

17:26.915 --> 17:30.092
I can be there in 15 minutes.
Who should I report to?

17:30.179 --> 17:32.921
Since Agent Tork has been
removed from active duty

17:33.008 --> 17:35.793
I assumed you would
want to replace him.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.708
Was I incorrect?

17:38.970 --> 17:41.625
[instrumental music]

17:43.453 --> 17:45.934
- Agent?
- No, you were not.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.937
We could, uh, definitely
use another set of hands.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.592
- Go in. We'll put you to work.
- Thank you, sir.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.637
Alright.

17:58.599 --> 18:01.080
Everything alright, agent?

18:02.342 --> 18:04.213
Oh, yeah. Excuse me.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.353
That was a nice game
you ran on Tork.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.095
Hmm. Tork.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.706
He was angry with
everybody taller than him.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.577
Certain to burst eventually.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.753
You wanted my attention.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.712
You got my attention.

18:24.799 --> 18:28.455
But if you try to run
another game on me or my people

18:28.542 --> 18:29.978
we're gonna have a problem.

18:30.065 --> 18:33.155
You know that Babe Ruth
wore a cabbage leaf

18:33.242 --> 18:36.071
under his cap
to keep himself cool?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.899
Changed it
every other inning.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.770
- Agent?
- Yeah.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.077
The night before the murder,
a woman called in

18:42.164 --> 18:44.384
a suspicious man in a car
near Kuzmenko's house.

18:44.471 --> 18:47.300
- Said he'd been there a while.
- She get the plate?

18:47.387 --> 18:49.171
Belongs to Mike Villanueva.

18:49.258 --> 18:52.261
Mike, when we talked,
you didn't mention visiting

18:52.348 --> 18:54.568
your buddy Markus' house
right before he got killed.

18:54.655 --> 18:57.310
I didn't wanna talk about
it in front of my boss.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.877
Why are you worried
about your boss?

18:59.964 --> 19:02.271
Business is down at the gym.

19:02.358 --> 19:05.013
Jocelyn's on us
to bring in new clients.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.581
Anyone who loses
clients is in trouble.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.409
And you're losing clients.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.453
No.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.412
[chuckles]
No, I'm not.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.153
Was Markus stealing
your clients?

19:14.240 --> 19:17.678
Yeah. Basically.

19:17.765 --> 19:20.637
Look, Markus got
the looks and the talk

19:20.724 --> 19:23.684
so people wanna
work with him.

19:23.771 --> 19:26.469
He doesn't push
them like I do.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.603
I work 'em hard.
And you know what I get?

19:29.690 --> 19:31.866
Five clients signing up
with Markus in a month.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.998
You went to Markus'
house to confront him.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.523
- I had to have it out with him.
- What happened?

19:36.610 --> 19:38.177
'Nothing. He apologized.'

19:38.264 --> 19:40.483
He took the clients
'cause he needed the cash.

19:40.570 --> 19:43.269
But he'd gotten money. He didn't
need the extra clients anymore.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.532
Then we went into his house
and got wasted.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.838
[chuckles]
And that's Markus, man.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.884
Went there to punch him,
ended up partying.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.452
- What'd he need the money for?
- He wouldn't tell me.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.541
Said that nobody
at the gym could know.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.369
Where'd he get the cash?

19:56.456 --> 19:58.197
He wouldn't tell me.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.633
But, uh..

19:59.720 --> 20:01.200
...I got a feeling..

20:01.287 --> 20:03.593
...from the way he talked..

20:03.680 --> 20:05.291
...it wasn't anyplace good.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.905
The question is, what did
Kuzmenko need money for?

20:10.992 --> 20:13.560
- And who did he get it from?
- That's two questions.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.693
- Excuse me?
- Two questions.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.043
Kuzmenko's boss at the gym,
Jocelyn Chapin

20:19.130 --> 20:20.828
sent over a list of his clients.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.004
There are some pretty
high-powered people on it.

20:23.091 --> 20:26.137
State senator, assemblyman,
people working for the governor.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.358
- It's the names I recognized.
- There's a lot of women here.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.709
[Haffner]
'Some of them would pay to keep
an affair with Kuzmenko quiet.'

20:32.796 --> 20:35.234
Think Kuzmenko slept with one
of them then blackmailed her.

20:35.321 --> 20:38.715
Maybe. What do you think, Jane?

20:38.802 --> 20:40.456
Mmm..

20:40.543 --> 20:43.242
Well, I wanna pursue it.
Look for the money Kuzmenko got.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.766
If it's not in his bank account,
check other accounts

20:45.853 --> 20:46.767
'safety deposit boxes..'

20:46.854 --> 20:48.116
Okay.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.639
Cho, we'll work
through this list

20:49.726 --> 20:51.206
starting with
his most recent clients

20:51.293 --> 20:53.164
try identifying
who he was sleeping with.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.819
Where are you going?

20:55.906 --> 20:58.344
Uh, I thought I'd just go
over to Kuzmenko's house

20:58.431 --> 20:59.997
take a little look around.

21:00.084 --> 21:04.001
- Why?
- It's what I do.

21:04.088 --> 21:07.091
Not alone.
Masterson, go with him.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.615
- Okay.
- Keep an eye on him.

21:08.702 --> 21:09.703
Yep.

21:11.835 --> 21:12.923
Okeydokey.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.238
So what are you
looking for?

21:23.325 --> 21:25.196
[Jane]
'Whatever's here to see.'

21:25.284 --> 21:26.981
[Masterson]
'We already went
through the house.'

21:27.068 --> 21:29.592
- 'We didn't find anything.'
- I'm sure you didn't.

21:33.988 --> 21:37.252
Pretty dull, yeah?

21:37.339 --> 21:39.776
If you wanna get a coffee,
I won't tell Haffner.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.300
Yeah, I'm gonna go do that.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.431
[scoffs]

21:43.693 --> 21:46.783
Suit yourself.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.830
Some more of this
tottering around.

21:53.964 --> 21:55.836
'See, me...uh..'

21:57.446 --> 21:59.579
...I like to take
a break now and then.

22:05.411 --> 22:09.066
A moment to, uh, rest and relax.

22:10.546 --> 22:13.549
Take it easy.

22:13.636 --> 22:16.683
Close the eyes..

22:16.770 --> 22:20.164
...and shut out the day.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.428
'Rest..'

22:22.515 --> 22:23.820
'...and relax.'

22:25.256 --> 22:28.172
Try not to see anything..

22:28.259 --> 22:30.174
...or hear anything.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.787
'Let time stop.'

22:33.874 --> 22:35.136
'Rest..'

22:36.659 --> 22:38.531
...and relax.

22:40.663 --> 22:43.536
[instrumental music]

22:48.758 --> 22:49.846
[thud]

22:51.065 --> 22:53.023
- What happened?
- Huh? Nothing.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.333
You did something to me,
didn't you?

23:00.291 --> 23:01.858
You hypnotized me.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.643
[chuckles]

23:03.730 --> 23:05.645
That's absurd.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.255
You know that only weak-minded

23:07.342 --> 23:11.041
and easily manipulated
people can be hypnotized.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.956
Yeah, we're leaving.

23:13.043 --> 23:15.132
- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are.

23:15.219 --> 23:16.395
Okay.

23:16.482 --> 23:19.398
[instrumental music]

23:24.446 --> 23:27.362
[intense music]

23:35.109 --> 23:37.067
[beeping]

23:37.154 --> 23:39.374
[phone rings]

23:39.461 --> 23:40.636
- 'Hello?'
- Laroche.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.464
- 'Yes.'
- Hi. It's Lisbon.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.945
I wanted to ask a favor.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.425
It's about Sally Carter.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.428
Sir?

23:49.515 --> 23:50.864
I'm busy, agent.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.561
Sorry, but there's
nothing unusual

23:52.648 --> 23:54.824
in Kuzmenko's checking
or savings accounts.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.870
- I found something else though.
- 'What?'

23:56.957 --> 23:59.307
A couple days before he
was killed, Kuzmenko made

23:59.394 --> 24:01.831
four phone calls
to an Oleg Mostovoi.

24:01.918 --> 24:04.355
He's not with the gym,
and it's the only time

24:04.443 --> 24:05.966
Kuzmenko made the calls.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.011
It's right before Kuzmenko
started saying he had

24:08.098 --> 24:10.927
a lotta cash. Maybe Mostovoi
had something to do with it.

24:11.014 --> 24:13.974
Or maybe he's a friend. Wanna
find the money, track the money.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.106
Find that, then we
can talk about Mustavoi

24:16.193 --> 24:19.109
Muscavoi, whatever his name is.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.068
[cell phone ringing]

24:22.983 --> 24:24.593
- Van Pelt.
- 'Grace.'

24:24.680 --> 24:27.291
- 'Time for the secret meeting.'
- I'll be right there.

24:27.378 --> 24:30.643
The way I see it, we got one
shot at saving Lisbon's job.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.471
[Rigsby]
You think we can?

24:32.558 --> 24:35.952
All we have to do is solve
the murder without Haffner.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.824
Then we take
the murderer to Bertram

24:37.911 --> 24:40.087
use our success as leverage
to get Lisbon back.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.219
- That's not gonna work.
- Come on.

24:42.306 --> 24:44.483
- When have I steered you wrong?
- Recently?

24:44.570 --> 24:46.746
How do we solve
the murder without Haffner?

24:46.833 --> 24:49.226
We catch the killer
before he does.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.098
'Kuzmenko was an athlete.'

24:51.185 --> 24:53.535
He was a compulsive
record keeper.

24:53.622 --> 24:56.320
No doubt that included
very detailed records

24:56.407 --> 25:00.107
of his sexual partners...
probably with a rating system.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.717
'You gotta get into the house'

25:01.804 --> 25:04.807
and you have to find
that list of lovers.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.722
It's probably in an address book

25:06.809 --> 25:08.942
a calendar or a journal.

25:09.029 --> 25:11.118
I don't like it.
It's insubordination.

25:11.205 --> 25:14.251
- 'We're already on the edge.'
- It's for the boss.

25:14.338 --> 25:17.254
This goes wrong, we're out. They
won't give us another chance.

25:17.341 --> 25:18.952
I don't care. I'm in.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.043
Me too.

25:23.130 --> 25:26.002
[intense music]

25:26.089 --> 25:27.569
Okay.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.179
That's the spirit.

25:29.266 --> 25:32.182
[intense music]

25:35.098 --> 25:37.971
[indistinct chattering]

25:46.240 --> 25:48.416
You wanted to know
if Jane is doing anything.

25:48.503 --> 25:51.288
[music continues]

25:51.375 --> 25:53.247
Take a seat.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.651
[instrumental music]

26:07.087 --> 26:08.828
Thank you for doing this.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.004
I don't mind, Teresa.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.223
Bertram has treated you poorly.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.965
Not that he solicits
my opinion on such matters.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.840
Why do you wanna
talk to Sally Carter?

26:20.927 --> 26:24.365
I wanna ask her some
questions about Red John.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.062
Hmm.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.891
She hasn't spoken since
her arrest, not to anyone

26:28.978 --> 26:31.720
so set your
expectations accordingly.

26:31.807 --> 26:34.505
Just so you know, um..

26:34.593 --> 26:37.073
...I am leaving
the Major Crimes Unit

26:37.160 --> 26:39.554
returning to
professional services.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.817
Was always
a temporary assignment.

26:41.904 --> 26:44.777
Well, good luck to you.

26:44.864 --> 26:46.953
Thank you.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.783
It was...interesting..

26:50.870 --> 26:53.437
...working with
you and Jane.

26:53.524 --> 26:56.702
I think that's the polite word
for what it was, but thanks.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.145
Open it up.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.363
[clanks]

27:07.147 --> 27:09.453
Mrs. Carter.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.846
'Mrs. Carter.'

27:15.329 --> 27:17.418
Get a medical team here!

27:17.505 --> 27:18.898
[woman shouting indistinctly]

27:20.813 --> 27:23.816
[woman on PA]
'Medical team
to cell C-38.'

27:23.903 --> 27:26.209
'Medical team
to cell C-3-8.'

27:26.296 --> 27:27.776
[alarm blaring]

27:27.863 --> 27:30.039
"All prisoners,
return to your cells.'

27:30.126 --> 27:32.999
[blaring continues]

27:35.088 --> 27:36.350
How?

27:36.437 --> 27:37.960
She got ahold of a spoon

27:38.047 --> 27:41.834
sharpened the shaft
slit her wrists and throat.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.270
What are you doing here?

27:43.357 --> 27:45.838
Came to ask her if her
husband was Red John.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.014
- Because you need convincing.
- Nice try.

27:48.101 --> 27:51.582
Turns out I didn't need to ask.
She left a note.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.410
"My life began the day I met

27:53.497 --> 27:56.065
"the Lord and master
of my heart, Red John.

27:56.152 --> 27:59.808
Now that he is dead,
all is shadows and silence."

27:59.895 --> 28:01.767
She goes on.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.812
Yeah, it's a bit purple.
Let me see.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.553
[intense music]

28:07.511 --> 28:10.036
See?

28:10.123 --> 28:11.080
You did it.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.343
You killed Red John.

28:13.430 --> 28:15.345
- Jane--
- Shh! I'm reading.

28:15.432 --> 28:18.305
[music continues]

28:20.002 --> 28:21.134
[muttering indistinctly]

28:22.309 --> 28:24.920
So how was the therapist?

28:25.007 --> 28:27.183
Talking about what happened
just makes me feel worse.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.750
I'm not gonna
see her anymore.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.752
Grace, you need counseling.
The job says so.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.580
It could be
a spiritual adviser.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.625
You know, my godfather's
a Presbyterian minister.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.759
- He'll sign the forms for me.
- You think that's a good idea?

28:37.846 --> 28:39.195
Yeah, I do.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.417
I got this.

28:43.504 --> 28:46.202
[instrumental music]

28:46.289 --> 28:47.595
[rattling]

28:49.902 --> 28:50.903
Agents?

28:52.861 --> 28:54.210
Looking for this?

28:55.864 --> 28:58.824
So I found this hidden
in Kuzmenko's bedroom.

28:58.911 --> 29:02.175
Fourteen of his clients are
named in it, with sexual details

29:02.262 --> 29:04.917
'and some kind of
coded rating system.'

29:05.004 --> 29:06.309
There's a really good chance

29:06.396 --> 29:08.442
that one of these
women killed him.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.705
But you weren't gonna
tell me that, were you?

29:10.792 --> 29:12.663
Probably not. No.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.056
Right.

29:14.143 --> 29:16.972
You wanted to solve
this one yourself.

29:17.059 --> 29:20.759
Uh...that was the plan.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.805
[chuckles]
Did you really think
that was gonna happen?

29:23.892 --> 29:27.374
Like I wasn't watching
you every minute?

29:27.461 --> 29:29.158
Jane, I would have
worked with you

29:29.245 --> 29:31.117
if you'd given me the chance.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.427
I'm taking this to Bertram.
Get out.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.045
- He go for it?
- Oh, did he.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.047
Time to break the news.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.310
[instrumental music]

29:51.398 --> 29:53.530
Let me get this straight.

29:53.617 --> 29:56.055
Haffner has the address book,
but it's a fake?

29:56.142 --> 29:57.883
Fake as a three dollar bill.

29:57.970 --> 30:00.494
Then how'd he find it
in Kuzmenko's house?

30:00.581 --> 30:02.061
Well, I copied the names

30:02.148 --> 30:04.237
from the list of
Kuzmenko's clients.

30:04.324 --> 30:07.066
Then I put the book
where Haffner would find it.

30:13.507 --> 30:16.466
I told Haffner Jane thought the
address book was at the house.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.251
- So he went to the house.
- Why?

30:18.338 --> 30:19.426
Haffner's all
about surveillance.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.210
I knew he'd be following us.

30:21.297 --> 30:23.517
I had to do something
to throw him off.

30:23.604 --> 30:26.041
Now we can solve the case
without Haffner watching us.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.087
- No. No, no.
- Don't be hasty.

30:28.174 --> 30:31.351
I will deal
with you in a minute!

30:31.438 --> 30:33.396
When Bertram finds out,
he'll have a coronary.

30:33.483 --> 30:34.963
We knew there was a risk.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.965
Which is why you
shouldn't have done it!

30:39.098 --> 30:40.882
'Go to Haffner and apologize.'

30:40.969 --> 30:43.493
- Tell him it was Jane's fault.
- That hardly seems fair.

30:43.580 --> 30:46.018
Maybe you can convince him
to give you another chance.

30:46.105 --> 30:49.108
- It's not gonna happen.
- She's right.

30:49.195 --> 30:53.286
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

30:53.373 --> 30:56.593
You were okay. All you had
to do was keep your heads down.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.595
We wanna work for you.

30:58.682 --> 31:01.598
[intense music]

31:07.517 --> 31:09.215
Let me talk to Jane alone.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.356
I could kill you
with my bare hands.

31:20.443 --> 31:21.967
Well, it's not
the first time.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.794
Come on.
You don't have a choice.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.579
You do nothing,
they get fired.

31:25.666 --> 31:28.451
You work with me,
they keep their jobs.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.323
And you might even
get yours back.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.281
Alright, but it's
just you and me.

31:32.368 --> 31:35.154
They don't do anything else.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.720
What's the plan?

31:36.807 --> 31:40.420
Plan is...
we catch the killer.

31:40.507 --> 31:41.900
Kind of obvious.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.554
Jocelyn Chapin.
Patrick Jane.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.600
We're on the verge
of catching the killer

31:46.687 --> 31:48.907
but we'll need your
help to pin him down.

31:48.994 --> 31:52.214
Get a pen and paper. You gotta
get some people to your gym.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.912
We'll need
some of the, shh

31:53.999 --> 31:57.132
the-the glowy spray stuff
the crime scene guys use.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.134
- Glowy spray stuff?
- Yes, the glowy spray stuff.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.962
It's vital.
Got a pen?

32:06.098 --> 32:07.664
We appreciate your help.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.275
Think this will work?

32:09.362 --> 32:11.494
Oh, I'm about 68.2% sure.

32:13.061 --> 32:15.150
Can I have everybody's
attention, please?

32:15.237 --> 32:18.501
Yes, everybody, you, those
with the, uh, ear things.

32:18.588 --> 32:22.070
Uh, yes, could you,
thank you. Sir.

32:22.157 --> 32:24.333
You too. Thank you.
This won't hurt a bit.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.945
My name is Patrick Jane.
This is Teresa Lisbon.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.730
We're investigating
the death of Markus Kuzmenko.

32:29.817 --> 32:33.690
'His killer is somewhere
in this room right now.'

32:33.777 --> 32:36.215
Kuzmenko was struck in
the head with a heavy object.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.347
We believe it was
one of those weights

32:38.434 --> 32:42.221
'from this gym, so we're
gonna test them with a spray'

32:42.308 --> 32:45.920
that can detect trace elements
of blood on a surface by glowing

32:46.007 --> 32:47.574
'even after it's been cleaned.'

32:47.661 --> 32:50.359
We find the weight,
we find our murderer.

32:50.446 --> 32:53.884
So if you could all
sit tight, be patient

32:53.972 --> 32:56.713
the killer will soon
be revealed. Thank you.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.280
- 'Excuse me.'
- Yes.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.587
- Hi. I-I'm an attorney.
- Oh.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.851
Even if you do find blood
on one of those weights

33:03.938 --> 33:06.636
there's no way to connect it
to anyone in this room.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.856
- Ah, fingerprints, my friend.
- 'Fingerprints?'

33:08.943 --> 33:10.989
My fingerprints are
on lots of those weights.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.774
That doesn't mean I
used them to kill anybody.

33:13.861 --> 33:15.471
You make an interesting point.

33:15.558 --> 33:18.170
Okay. Hypothetical.

33:18.257 --> 33:21.869
What if I hid
the weight in my car?

33:21.956 --> 33:24.959
Or my office? My house?

33:25.046 --> 33:26.743
Would that prove
I was the killer?

33:26.830 --> 33:30.791
I-if you found the murder
weapon in my car, yeah.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.619
- Is it in your car?
- No.

33:32.706 --> 33:35.926
No, I knew it wasn't in your
car, because it's in her car.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.928
- 'Right, Jocelyn?'
- What?

33:38.016 --> 33:41.715
The weight you
used to kill Markus.

33:41.802 --> 33:45.240
You hid it in your car when we
told you we were coming over.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.155
- No.
- Oh, please.

33:47.242 --> 33:49.070
You practically
jumped out of your skin

33:49.157 --> 33:50.941
at the mention of "car."

33:51.029 --> 33:52.465
- No, I didn't.
- 'Yes, you did.'

33:52.552 --> 33:54.771
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

33:54.858 --> 33:57.209
Okay. There's only one
way we can settle this.

33:57.296 --> 33:58.601
Shall we?

34:05.391 --> 34:08.437
What's this?

34:08.524 --> 34:10.526
It's a kettlebell.

34:10.613 --> 34:13.225
I keep it in my trunk
for visits to clients' houses.

34:19.666 --> 34:20.623
[hissing]

34:26.107 --> 34:28.283
'Can you explain why
it has blood on it?'

34:31.243 --> 34:34.811
Ms. Chapin, I just spoke
to a man named Oleg Mostovoi.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.422
He's a loan shark.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.467
He said a few days
before the murder

34:38.554 --> 34:40.643
he loaned Kuzmenko $75,000

34:40.730 --> 34:44.995
and that Kuzmenko said he needed
the money to start his own gym.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.042
Is that why you killed him,
he was gonna compete with you?

34:48.129 --> 34:49.435
I heard from a realtor

34:49.522 --> 34:51.393
that Markus was
looking at gym spaces.

34:53.003 --> 34:55.702
My gym isn't doing
so well anymore

34:55.789 --> 34:58.922
so if he would...would have
left and...taken his clients

34:59.009 --> 35:00.968
I wouldn't have
been able to stay open.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.622
You confronted him.

35:04.189 --> 35:06.930
I begged him to stay.

35:07.017 --> 35:08.584
I mean, it's embarrassing.

35:08.671 --> 35:11.805
I...I said that
he shouldn't leave

35:11.892 --> 35:14.068
because of what
we meant to each other.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.595
And he just looked at me

35:19.682 --> 35:22.729
like he had no idea
what I was talking about.

35:22.816 --> 35:24.687
I mean,
he'd just forgotten.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.910
I suppose there had been
that many girls since.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.349
Oh, and then
he remembered later

35:34.436 --> 35:36.569
and he was charming,
of course, but..

35:40.312 --> 35:43.358
...I just...I just couldn't
help remember that look..

35:45.534 --> 35:48.015
...like I'd been deleted.

35:48.102 --> 35:51.061
And so I went to his house
and I waited for him.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.070
[grunts]

36:00.158 --> 36:03.073
[panting]

36:07.252 --> 36:11.473
You know, I-I don't
know why I did it. I..

36:11.560 --> 36:14.346
I've been on this
super strict diet.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.304
'You know, it messes
with your blood sugar.'

36:18.828 --> 36:20.874
Maybe that's it.

36:29.796 --> 36:32.364
Ray, you told me

36:32.451 --> 36:34.540
that this book
contained the names

36:34.627 --> 36:37.064
of many politically
prominent women

36:37.151 --> 36:40.415
who were carrying on affairs
with the victim in your case

36:40.502 --> 36:42.678
and your killer was
likely one of these women.

36:42.765 --> 36:46.769
Yeah, which is
a PR nightmare. Right?

36:46.856 --> 36:50.469
So I called the leadership
of both parties to warn them

36:50.556 --> 36:53.559
that we-we might have to act
on this because the one thing

36:53.646 --> 36:56.953
they hate more than bad news
is being surprised by it.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.218
But then...lo and behold

37:00.305 --> 37:05.919
I find out that-that-that
the names in here are forged.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.095
'There's no scandal.'

37:08.182 --> 37:09.705
'No, the book didn't even'

37:09.792 --> 37:11.794
belong to the victim.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.318
It's yours, I assume.

37:13.405 --> 37:16.625
Uh, yeah, if I could.
Uh, thank you.

37:16.712 --> 37:19.672
'I hate raising false alarms.'

37:19.759 --> 37:22.327
It makes me feel so foolish

37:22.414 --> 37:24.285
which I suppose was the point.

37:24.372 --> 37:26.069
- Well, maybe--
- Okay, if I may, sir--

37:26.156 --> 37:29.203
No, you may not.

37:29.290 --> 37:34.121
Now, Ray, I-I thought
that you could handle Jane.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.428
'Well, we all make mistakes.'

37:36.515 --> 37:39.866
But we'll find something else
for you to do. Don't worry.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.968
[sighs]

37:55.055 --> 37:57.927
Now...I have a problem.

37:59.842 --> 38:04.369
Because, uh, our urgent
need for your skills

38:04.456 --> 38:08.460
is precisely balanced
by my desire to fire you

38:08.547 --> 38:10.766
before you
destroy the bureau

38:10.853 --> 38:13.378
or my career.

38:13.465 --> 38:15.162
Or both.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.471
I understand.

38:19.558 --> 38:21.516
Mm. You're in a tough spot.

38:23.866 --> 38:26.086
You know who's always,
uh, been a very, uh

38:26.173 --> 38:29.002
healthy moderating
influence on me?

38:29.089 --> 38:30.830
[chuckles]

38:30.917 --> 38:33.354
Yeah. Of course.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.182
Lisbon.

38:35.269 --> 38:37.097
I'm sorry.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.925
Not possible.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.406
Well, then..

38:41.493 --> 38:43.799
...you will continue
to have a problem.

38:43.886 --> 38:46.759
[instrumental music]

38:54.593 --> 38:56.595
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.901
- You settling back in?
- Almost.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.513
- Yeah.
- How'd you do it?

39:01.600 --> 39:02.992
Get Bertram to come around?

39:03.079 --> 39:05.212
Oh, wasn't so hard.

39:05.299 --> 39:08.433
Rational discussion
between two reasonable men.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.566
[chuckling]
Rational discussion. I bet.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.046
Mm-hmm.

39:13.133 --> 39:16.615
But, uh...
by all means...go ahead.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.530
I'm sorry?

39:18.617 --> 39:20.270
Say it.
I won't get embarrassed.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.489
Say what?

39:22.447 --> 39:23.404
[whistling]

39:23.491 --> 39:25.232
Oh. You mean say thank you?

39:25.319 --> 39:29.845
Oh...you're welcome.
Was it so hard?

39:29.932 --> 39:32.195
The thing is,
not dealing with you every day

39:32.282 --> 39:33.980
has been very
restful for me.

39:34.067 --> 39:36.330
My back pain's gone.
I sleep really well.

39:36.417 --> 39:40.116
So, I'm actually not so sure
I'm grateful to be back.

39:40.203 --> 39:41.988
You're a terrible liar.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.991
No offense. Good, honest
people always bad liars.

39:45.078 --> 39:47.080
Which makes you what?

39:47.167 --> 39:49.082
Jane? Security just called.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.910
They've got someone
waiting for you downstairs.

39:50.997 --> 39:52.259
Name's Rosalind Harker.

39:52.346 --> 39:53.347
- Thanks, Grace.
- No problem.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.740
The woman that lived with

39:54.827 --> 39:56.568
Red John three
or four years ago?

39:56.655 --> 39:57.960
They didn't actually
live together.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.788
Uh, he was more
the gentleman caller.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.878
- What are you seeing her for?
- Great to have you back.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.880
What are you doing, Jane?

40:09.058 --> 40:10.190
[door squeaks]

40:10.277 --> 40:12.192
Thanks for agreeing
to this, Rosalind.

40:12.279 --> 40:15.151
I wasn't busy.
Besides, it sounded urgent.

40:15.238 --> 40:17.415
It is, in a way.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.504
Are you still playing piano?

40:19.591 --> 40:21.810
Not really. I'm tired
of playing for myself.

40:21.897 --> 40:24.378
- I think I need an audience.
- Okay, it's just here.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.772
And through a doorway
to the right.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.863
Something the matter?

40:30.950 --> 40:33.126
[inhales deeply]
Just a chill.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.869
- Let's go.
- Okay.

40:47.357 --> 40:50.186
[rattling]

40:55.888 --> 40:57.890
No one claimed the body?

40:57.977 --> 41:00.153
That's so sad.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.982
You'd think they'd have
done something with it.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.637
There must be a waiting
period or something.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.377
Yeah, something like that.

41:09.075 --> 41:11.599
You understand..

41:11.686 --> 41:15.821
he never called himself
Red John to me.

41:15.908 --> 41:20.652
The man I knew
was Roy Tagliaferro.

41:20.739 --> 41:23.568
Roy and Red John
are the same person.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.134
I'm sure of it.

41:31.314 --> 41:32.751
Is this him?

41:58.646 --> 42:00.300
I never met this man.

42:00.387 --> 42:02.345
I have no idea who he is.

42:04.783 --> 42:06.262
Thank you.

42:06.349 --> 42:09.265
[intense music]

42:11.572 --> 42:13.531
[rattling]

42:25.891 --> 42:28.110
[theme music]
