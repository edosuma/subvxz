01:00.884 --> 01:03.751
Freddie!

01:28.384 --> 01:29.817
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:32.551 --> 01:33.784
Should we go in?

01:34.384 --> 01:35.784
No, no.

01:35.817 --> 01:39.417
No, just let her get some rest.

01:39.450 --> 01:43.317
...temporal lobe where
most of the damage took place.

01:43.350 --> 01:46.651
Due to the hematoma

01:46.684 --> 01:50.417
and the CNS pathways
being affected,

01:50.450 --> 01:52.517
there's been an onset
of Aphasia.

01:53.851 --> 01:56.417
Sorry, it's just, uh...

01:57.417 --> 01:59.584
It's a lot of words now...

01:59.617 --> 02:02.617
really know what
any of them mean, so...

02:05.551 --> 02:08.517
I don't think things are ever
going back to the way they were.

02:10.817 --> 02:14.250
Some choices need to be made
for us to move forward.

02:14.284 --> 02:15.784
Okay.

02:18.350 --> 02:21.050
So, um... I mean how...

02:22.851 --> 02:26.183
How much time
does she have, then?

02:26.217 --> 02:28.250
We'll know more
in a couple of days.

02:32.150 --> 02:34.484
Is there any hope of her
memories returning?

02:34.517 --> 02:36.517
Well, in theory,

02:36.551 --> 02:38.784
every experience
we have in our lives

02:38.817 --> 02:40.617
is stored in our
brain somewhere.

02:57.684 --> 03:00.350
<i>Identifying patterns
in past data</i>

03:00.384 --> 03:02.651
<i>to predict trends
in future data</i>

03:02.684 --> 03:07.217
<i>is how all successful organizations
make beneficial decisions.</i>

03:07.250 --> 03:11.617
<i>And that's what we do here
in data analytics.</i>

03:11.651 --> 03:15.217
Inventory levels, employee break times.
It could be anything.

03:15.250 --> 03:19.250
It is all just patterns
for us to identify,

03:19.284 --> 03:21.551
<i>quantify and label.</i>

03:48.584 --> 03:52.284
So I see here
a bit of schooling in...

03:52.317 --> 03:53.584
Visual Arts?

03:53.617 --> 03:55.817
Yeah, I... That's, um...

03:56.784 --> 03:59.050
Dreams of youth, I guess.

04:08.517 --> 04:10.551
Fred got a new job!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.450
You should tell her
about it, Fred.

04:16.117 --> 04:18.083
<i>It's really great.</i>

04:18.117 --> 04:19.717
<i>He's doing really well.</i>

04:28.117 --> 04:30.384
She's not gone, you know,
she's still here.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.050
Yeah, no, I know.

04:34.384 --> 04:36.350
- I love you.
- I love you too.

05:08.751 --> 05:10.183
Fuck it.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.517
<i>Hello?</i>

05:29.350 --> 05:31.551
<i>Hel...</i>

05:35.317 --> 05:37.250
<i>Hel...</i>

05:39.217 --> 05:40.784
Come on.

05:41.617 --> 05:43.150
Obey...

05:44.784 --> 05:46.284
Prison...

05:49.450 --> 05:50.651
System...

05:53.751 --> 05:55.684
Language...

05:55.717 --> 05:56.751
<i>Fred...</i>

06:02.717 --> 06:04.083
Cindy?

06:07.717 --> 06:09.450
Don't let me go.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.484
Fucking asshole.

08:23.317 --> 08:24.484
What?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.517
Fred.

08:55.551 --> 08:56.851
Yeah?

08:56.884 --> 08:58.584
What are you doing?

08:59.784 --> 09:01.183
Uh...

09:01.717 --> 09:03.484
Nothing, just...

09:04.617 --> 09:06.317
You know, organizing.

09:07.384 --> 09:09.183
In the middle of the night?

09:10.384 --> 09:11.484
Yeah.

09:14.717 --> 09:16.651
<i>And so
our portal-based software</i>

09:16.684 --> 09:19.584
will enable a new level
of granular metrics.

09:19.617 --> 09:22.517
Essentially, we need to
anticipate our clients' needs

09:22.551 --> 09:24.817
to know what they want
before they do.

09:24.851 --> 09:27.851
Now, we to understand
how they think before they do.

09:27.884 --> 09:29.217
We need, in effect, to be...

09:29.250 --> 09:30.784
The Art Spirit.

09:30.817 --> 09:32.284
What?

09:32.317 --> 09:35.784
<i>The Art Spirit</i> by Robert Henri.

09:35.817 --> 09:38.117
You borrowed that
your senior year

09:38.150 --> 09:39.450
and it was never returned.

09:39.484 --> 09:42.150
Oh, oh. Okay, uh, yeah.

09:42.183 --> 09:44.350
I could see-see
what I could do about that.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.784
How do you even remember that?

09:45.817 --> 09:50.117
I remember
little Freddie Fitzell.

09:50.150 --> 09:53.350
And, yes, I do remember
Cindy Williams,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.817
due to her, well,
um, troubles, you know,

09:55.851 --> 09:58.484
<i>attendance and whatnot.</i>

09:58.517 --> 10:00.484
<i>So, I've been having
trouble tracking her down.</i>

10:00.517 --> 10:02.350
<i>I haven't been able to find
a single trace of her</i>

10:02.384 --> 10:03.517
<i>since graduation.</i>

10:03.551 --> 10:04.617
<i>Well, that figures.</i>

10:04.651 --> 10:06.183
<i>She never turned up</i>

10:06.217 --> 10:08.751
<i>for final exams
your graduation year</i>

10:08.784 --> 10:11.317
<i>so she didn't graduate.</i>

10:12.684 --> 10:14.517
<i>She just vanished.</i>

10:15.584 --> 10:17.384
Of course, that was the time

10:17.417 --> 10:21.450
when that awful drug
went around the school.

10:24.417 --> 10:27.517
Lost a couple students to it,
if I remember.

10:27.551 --> 10:29.684
What was that
horrible stuff called?

10:29.717 --> 10:31.517
Uh, Mercury.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.484
It was called Mercury.

11:33.717 --> 11:36.117
I was thinking maybe we could
knock down the wall

11:36.150 --> 11:38.584
between the spare room
and the closet.

11:38.617 --> 11:41.551
Maybe make a walk-in
or a home office.

11:41.584 --> 11:44.150
Eventually a baby room?

11:44.183 --> 11:45.584
You know who I saw today?

11:46.884 --> 11:48.284
Who?

11:48.317 --> 11:50.484
Mrs. Shouldice.

11:50.517 --> 11:52.183
Remember, from Fairgate?

11:52.217 --> 11:53.751
Do you believe it,
she's still there?

11:53.784 --> 11:55.217
Where'd you see her?

11:56.584 --> 11:59.484
Uh, I went by the school,
actually, um...

12:01.717 --> 12:04.751
I don't know, I guess I was
feeling nostalgic or something.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.284
What?

12:07.317 --> 12:09.350
Nothing, it's just
a little weird.

12:09.384 --> 12:10.784
You wanna choose one?

12:10.817 --> 12:11.817
Sure.

12:15.717 --> 12:17.384
Um...

12:29.150 --> 12:31.784
No, we are not having
a purple bathroom.

12:32.684 --> 12:34.484
It says medieval wine.

12:36.751 --> 12:39.617
Why? Goes with the curtains.

12:39.651 --> 12:41.584
We could be like

12:41.617 --> 12:44.417
the couple that matches
their bathroom stuff.

13:10.284 --> 13:14.250
Anyone talking during
the test will receive an automatic zero.

13:14.284 --> 13:16.150
Anyone getting up
from their desk

13:16.183 --> 13:18.317
during the test
will receive a zero.

13:18.350 --> 13:21.450
Anyone looking
at someone else's paper

13:21.484 --> 13:25.450
will receive a big, fat zero.

13:26.651 --> 13:28.317
Miss Williams?

13:28.350 --> 13:29.751
Are you with us?

13:29.784 --> 13:33.450
Talking. Moving. Looking.

13:33.851 --> 13:35.684
Zero.

13:35.717 --> 13:37.717
If you do not
do well on this quiz

13:37.751 --> 13:41.384
it means you have not familiarized
yourself with the material.

13:41.417 --> 13:44.417
Which means you will probably
fail your final exam,

13:44.450 --> 13:49.183
not graduate high school,
not find gainful employment,

13:49.217 --> 13:52.684
which means it will be
very difficult for you

13:52.717 --> 13:57.517
to entice the woman
of your dreams.

13:57.551 --> 14:01.517
Mr. Fitzell, have I connected

14:01.551 --> 14:05.384
D to C to B
all the way back to A,

14:05.417 --> 14:08.817
which is where you're sitting,
in a way that is sufficient

14:08.851 --> 14:12.484
for you to understand
the significance of A?

14:13.484 --> 14:14.551
Yeah.

14:15.884 --> 14:17.684
There's your girl.

14:19.183 --> 14:21.217
You'll have 60 minutes.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.651
And begin...

14:23.684 --> 14:25.050
now.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.350
Mr. McDonald, could I go
to the bathroom really quick?

15:19.384 --> 15:22.284
When you've finished
your test, Mr. Fitzell.

15:31.551 --> 15:33.217
Finished!

16:34.150 --> 16:36.817
Hey, man. You got them?
Come over here.

16:40.851 --> 16:41.784
Thank you.

16:44.183 --> 16:46.117
Lobby.

17:21.150 --> 17:22.384
Lobby...

17:26.884 --> 17:28.317
Language...

18:03.384 --> 18:05.083
...your.

18:07.517 --> 18:09.150
...your.

18:15.717 --> 18:17.217
What?

18:42.751 --> 18:46.183
I'm in... your... lobby.

20:25.317 --> 20:27.083
What the fuck am I doing?

21:05.717 --> 21:07.384
Fred...

21:07.417 --> 21:09.183
It's all right.

21:09.217 --> 21:11.317
Fred, stay with me.

21:11.350 --> 21:14.183
Do you hear me?
Stay with me, Fred. Fred.

21:14.217 --> 21:17.817
Fred! Fight!
Fred, fight! Get off of him!

21:17.851 --> 21:20.484
Let him go!
Fred, fight!

21:20.517 --> 21:23.350
- Fred!
- Fred! Don't let me go.

21:24.217 --> 21:25.384
Fred!

21:26.450 --> 21:28.217
Hey.

21:28.250 --> 21:31.150
You're okay.

21:35.183 --> 21:37.117
Jesus, what happened?

22:00.584 --> 22:01.617
Fred?

22:02.784 --> 22:04.584
She's ready for us.

22:05.684 --> 22:07.617
Okay, I'll be right there.

22:15.684 --> 22:17.484
Look who's here!

22:18.217 --> 22:19.384
Hey, Mom.

22:19.417 --> 22:20.584
How you feeling?

22:30.484 --> 22:32.450
Wow, what's all this?

22:32.484 --> 22:35.317
Janice has been helping
her organize her photos.

22:38.183 --> 22:39.751
Those my old drawings?

22:42.250 --> 22:43.551
Oh, wow.

22:44.584 --> 22:46.250
Ma, hey, you remember this one?

22:47.717 --> 22:49.183
Remember?

22:50.384 --> 22:52.284
The little yellow house?

22:52.317 --> 22:53.584
I always said
I wanted to live in

22:53.617 --> 22:55.751
an all yellow house
when I grew up.

23:01.817 --> 23:03.284
It's okay.

23:14.183 --> 23:15.250
<i>Come on, Freddie.</i>

23:17.617 --> 23:20.083
Time to clean up your crayons
and brush your teeth.

23:22.584 --> 23:24.751
Come on, buddy.
Put them all away.

23:24.784 --> 23:26.484
I don't want to.

23:26.517 --> 23:29.617
Freddie,
Santa knows which little boys

23:29.651 --> 23:32.117
listen to their mothers
and which ones don't.

23:32.150 --> 23:35.417
You want Santa to bring you
presents or coal?

24:21.851 --> 24:23.350
Freddie!

24:30.684 --> 24:33.183
So, we're all moved into
our new apartment.

24:33.217 --> 24:34.684
You should tell her
about it, Fred.

25:09.484 --> 25:12.150
Here, take this!
Hide it! Hide it!

25:12.183 --> 25:15.117
Look, man,
they won't suspect you.

25:52.117 --> 25:53.117
<i>Hey!</i>

25:55.717 --> 25:57.717
Look, I know it's really hard
to see her...

25:57.751 --> 25:59.450
Just stop, she...

26:02.651 --> 26:04.450
She doesn't know who I am.

26:07.817 --> 26:10.384
She's gone,
she's-she's already gone.

26:44.217 --> 26:46.117
Motherfucker!

26:54.284 --> 26:56.250
Shit, man.

26:56.284 --> 26:57.617
How long has it been?

26:57.651 --> 26:59.651
- Thirteen years?
- No!

26:59.684 --> 27:02.083
Yeah. I can't believe you were
at your mom's when I called.

27:02.117 --> 27:04.584
- I didn't expect that.
- No, man, I live there.

27:04.617 --> 27:06.517
Mm, fuck, really?

27:06.551 --> 27:09.484
Yeah, man. You know, I got
all my creature comforts there,

27:09.517 --> 27:12.384
and it's just a stone's throw
from my "office,"

27:12.417 --> 27:14.651
- So, you know.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

27:14.684 --> 27:17.551
It's so crazy
seeing you, man.

27:17.584 --> 27:20.117
Yeah. You too, man.
I can't even remember how we lost touch.

27:20.150 --> 27:22.450
No, me neither, man.
Me neither.

27:25.751 --> 27:27.050
Well...

27:28.417 --> 27:29.851
Let's get fucked up.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.450
Hey, I'm so glad
you called, man.

27:34.484 --> 27:35.717
So, you really...
You didn't keep in touch

27:35.751 --> 27:37.851
with Cindy at all
after graduation?

27:37.884 --> 27:39.517
Aw, you kidding, man?

27:39.551 --> 27:43.817
I forgot that chick
as soon as I could.

27:43.851 --> 27:46.350
You, on the other hand,
I'd never forget.

27:46.384 --> 27:49.517
It's just...
I've been remembering things.

27:49.551 --> 27:53.350
This one night, you, me, Cindy,
when we were on Mercury...

27:55.584 --> 27:57.217
What the hell was that shit?

27:58.617 --> 28:00.284
Who knows?

28:00.317 --> 28:01.851
You don't remember anything
bad happening to her?

28:01.884 --> 28:03.617
Man, that shit was strong.

28:03.651 --> 28:06.284
I couldn't remember
what happened the next day.

28:06.317 --> 28:09.350
You think I'm gonna remember
that shit now?

28:12.284 --> 28:15.450
Hey, I'll tell you
what I do remember:

28:16.584 --> 28:19.117
the first time you tried Merc.

28:20.450 --> 28:21.817
Do you remember that?

28:21.851 --> 28:24.217
Yep. How could I forget.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.117
Janitors gotta get high too.

29:11.751 --> 29:15.450
Andre, Cindy, this is Fred.

29:15.484 --> 29:18.450
Fred has a talent for being in
the right place at the right time.

29:18.484 --> 29:21.350
I just hid the bag.
It wasn't a big deal.

29:21.384 --> 29:24.617
Mm-hm. Well, it's time
to stop hiding it.

29:28.717 --> 29:31.551
- It's time to stop hiding it, Fred.
- Oh, shit. Sorry.

29:35.684 --> 29:37.250
Here's your reward.

29:42.584 --> 29:44.517
You've never done Merc, huh?

29:45.284 --> 29:47.517
Merc? Uh...

29:47.551 --> 29:50.250
No, I just stick to weed mostly.

29:50.284 --> 29:51.417
Mm.

29:53.150 --> 29:56.450
- I smoke it a lot.
- Mm. Hm-hm.

29:56.484 --> 29:58.751
Hey, man, once again,
right place, right time, huh?

29:58.784 --> 30:01.317
Could you just
stop fucking talking?

30:05.817 --> 30:07.083
Move.

30:16.551 --> 30:18.717
Don't worry,
it's not even pure Merc.

30:18.751 --> 30:20.817
Cut with other shit, diluted.

30:20.851 --> 30:22.284
Yeah, when are we
getting the real stuff?

30:22.317 --> 30:24.484
- Soon.
- Oh, what...

30:24.517 --> 30:25.584
What does it do to you?

30:35.217 --> 30:37.117
Hey...

30:37.150 --> 30:39.150
Don't let anything
influence you.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.284
Make a choice yourself.

30:58.851 --> 31:01.183
Well, what do we do now?

31:01.217 --> 31:04.517
Sit back... enjoy the show.

32:03.417 --> 32:05.584
You shouldn't have
given it to him, Sebastian.

32:05.617 --> 32:06.784
Look at him.

32:08.317 --> 32:11.050
He's fine.

32:12.484 --> 32:14.551
What?

33:26.284 --> 33:27.651
You're doing good.

33:36.150 --> 33:39.417
There's so much to explore if you
don't succumb to pleasure or fear.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.284
Are you following me?

33:51.217 --> 33:52.751
Uh...

33:52.784 --> 33:55.817
No, no. I don't...
I mean, I...

33:55.851 --> 33:57.817
You're either coming with me
or you're letting me go.

33:58.617 --> 34:00.083
Which one is it?

34:03.584 --> 34:04.651
I'm coming.

34:06.217 --> 34:08.284
I'm not your tour guide.

34:08.317 --> 34:10.717
I don't take it to be like them.

34:14.450 --> 34:16.317
<i>I take it to explore.</i>

34:18.684 --> 34:20.217
<i>Explore where?</i>

34:23.717 --> 34:25.317
<i>Anywhere but here.</i>

34:38.183 --> 34:39.617
Wait, wait...

35:48.284 --> 35:50.684
I'm sorry.
My mind's just wandering.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.317
Your mind is wandering?

36:03.317 --> 36:05.083
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

36:20.217 --> 36:21.551
You're drawing again?

36:21.584 --> 36:24.484
No, no, that's, uh...

36:24.517 --> 36:27.450
Not really.
Just, uh, some illustrations.

36:33.417 --> 36:35.417
How's the job going?

36:35.450 --> 36:37.617
Karen, relax. It's just
a couple of drawings, okay.

36:37.651 --> 36:40.150
I just asked
how the job was going.

37:00.284 --> 37:03.784
Nothing for 13 years,
now I can't get rid of you.

37:03.817 --> 37:05.350
I can't believe
you still live here.

37:05.384 --> 37:08.784
Listen, my mom's having
a little nap, so, shh.

37:10.517 --> 37:13.417
Oh, I got a little
surprise for you.

37:20.817 --> 37:22.551
No shit. Andre?

37:22.584 --> 37:24.183
Sorry.

37:24.217 --> 37:25.684
It's good to see you, Fred.

37:25.717 --> 37:27.150
Dude...

37:27.183 --> 37:30.484
It's good to see you too, man!
Holy shit!

37:30.517 --> 37:33.551
Oh, Andre, man, what's going on?
How you been?

37:33.584 --> 37:37.617
Well, um, married,
two kids, two and a half.

37:37.651 --> 37:39.183
Jenny's pregnant again.

37:39.217 --> 37:42.083
Wow, Jesus. Shit.

37:42.117 --> 37:43.284
What about you?

37:43.317 --> 37:47.417
I'm an information analyst
right now, so...

37:47.450 --> 37:49.817
- Oh.
- Hey, hey, old times, huh?

37:49.851 --> 37:51.517
Old times.

37:51.551 --> 37:53.784
<i>The play has been overturned
to an incomplete pass.</i>

37:53.817 --> 37:56.150
Cindy? No way.

37:56.183 --> 37:58.817
Uh, she hasn't even
crossed my mind in 15 years.

37:58.851 --> 38:01.450
What about her friend,
what was her name?

38:01.484 --> 38:02.784
Laurie something, I don't know,

38:02.817 --> 38:04.417
but you think maybe
she kept in touch with her?

38:04.450 --> 38:06.384
Man,
wherever she is, she's fine.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.183
That girl never needed anyone.

38:08.217 --> 38:10.183
Why are we even
talking about her?

38:10.217 --> 38:11.817
Sebastian? Honey?

38:11.851 --> 38:15.284
Oh, shit. Well, she's up.

38:15.317 --> 38:17.551
- Sebastian!
- Yeah, Ma?

38:20.651 --> 38:23.517
So, what's this whole
Cindy thing about anyway?

38:27.651 --> 38:29.617
I don't know,
it's just been, um,

38:29.651 --> 38:32.250
I've been remembering
things recently.

38:33.817 --> 38:36.417
There's just one night
we were on Merc.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.584
And I can't just sh...

38:40.617 --> 38:42.517
I can't shake the feeling
that something...

38:42.551 --> 38:44.484
something bad happened to her.

38:45.784 --> 38:49.050
You know, and we all forgot.

38:55.117 --> 39:00.284
Man, that whole time back then
is just "shew"... You know?

39:00.317 --> 39:02.083
Hard to make heads or tails
of any of that.

39:06.784 --> 39:08.350
Have you studied at all?

39:08.851 --> 39:10.317
What?

39:15.851 --> 39:18.284
Have you studied yet?

39:21.450 --> 39:23.417
Hey, what the fuck
you talking about?

39:25.183 --> 39:27.651
For final exams?

39:30.784 --> 39:32.651
You don't understand
what I'm saying?

39:55.717 --> 39:57.183
Hey, Fred.

40:08.517 --> 40:11.284
Yeah, hi, Fred.

40:11.317 --> 40:13.584
Look at these two already.

40:13.617 --> 40:16.083
All right, you crackheads,
let's go.

40:16.117 --> 40:18.150
I got to meet my guy.

40:37.651 --> 40:40.284
How old are you?

40:40.317 --> 40:42.717
Old enough to know this place
is a piece of shit.

40:42.751 --> 40:44.250
I'll meet you out back.

40:47.884 --> 40:49.284
Where we going?

40:54.784 --> 40:56.751
What if they catch us up here?

40:58.684 --> 41:00.183
They don't.

41:06.150 --> 41:07.284
What?

41:07.317 --> 41:10.284
I was just realizing that...

41:10.317 --> 41:12.284
I don't know if we've ever
had a conversation

41:12.317 --> 41:14.350
where we weren't on Merc.

41:17.284 --> 41:19.784
It's like you only exist
when I'm on this drug.

41:23.817 --> 41:25.517
What are you looking for?

41:27.484 --> 41:31.050
Why is it so important
for you to explore?

41:32.651 --> 41:34.517
I don't want to be like them.

41:37.183 --> 41:39.284
Locked in a prison

41:39.317 --> 41:41.284
that they forgot
that they're in.

41:42.284 --> 41:43.384
What prison?

41:44.617 --> 41:46.183
Look at all of them.

41:47.417 --> 41:48.751
Running around.

41:48.784 --> 41:51.484
Pretending they know
exactly who they are

41:51.517 --> 41:53.350
and why they're doing
what they're doing.

41:53.384 --> 41:56.417
They-they don't
have a fucking clue.

41:59.884 --> 42:02.350
None of it matters.

42:02.384 --> 42:04.284
All they're doing is...

42:04.317 --> 42:07.250
giving things labels.

42:07.284 --> 42:09.651
Giving inaccurate names
to things that are

42:09.684 --> 42:12.551
infinite and unknowable.

42:14.584 --> 42:16.484
This is your name.

42:16.517 --> 42:18.684
This is your house.

42:18.717 --> 42:21.250
This is your language.

42:21.284 --> 42:23.250
This is your job.

42:23.284 --> 42:25.117
Labeling every
little thing,

42:25.150 --> 42:28.784
even the fucking label-maker.

42:28.817 --> 42:31.450
And then they look around
at their world of...

42:33.417 --> 42:36.050
utterly meaningless labels

42:37.751 --> 42:39.651
and say...

42:42.117 --> 42:44.384
"This is our reality."

42:47.784 --> 42:48.784
That prison.

42:54.384 --> 42:56.284
But how do we break free, then?

42:56.317 --> 42:58.284
We?

43:00.250 --> 43:02.117
Are you following me again?

43:02.684 --> 43:04.083
Uh...

43:05.484 --> 43:06.517
Yeah.

43:10.651 --> 43:12.617
We have to remember

43:12.651 --> 43:14.584
the power that we have.

43:15.751 --> 43:18.050
The power of choice.

43:19.450 --> 43:22.350
The power
of every single second.

43:24.717 --> 43:27.083
The power of... now.

43:29.684 --> 43:30.784
Now.

43:35.817 --> 43:37.083
Now.

43:49.684 --> 43:52.217
Well, they're probably
looking for us.

43:59.384 --> 44:01.083
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy.

44:01.117 --> 44:02.851
Hey-hey-hey-hey, calm down.

44:02.883 --> 44:04.651
Get her on her side.

44:09.517 --> 44:11.217
Choosing...

44:12.250 --> 44:14.384
Life-form... Which...

44:14.417 --> 44:16.083
Shape...

44:16.117 --> 44:17.050
Gold...

44:18.784 --> 44:19.784
Hey, man!

44:19.817 --> 44:21.717
Whoop.

44:21.751 --> 44:24.284
Massive score. It's in.

44:24.317 --> 44:27.717
How'd you like to do pure,
uncut Merc.

44:28.784 --> 44:30.217
They said we could get some

44:30.250 --> 44:32.551
at, uh, this place...

44:32.584 --> 44:34.250
next week...

44:36.684 --> 44:38.484
...if we drop by.

44:41.684 --> 44:43.384
This is it.

44:44.684 --> 44:46.617
This is how it happens.

44:53.250 --> 44:55.350
- Fred?
- Yes, um...

44:55.384 --> 44:56.817
What are you doing?

44:56.851 --> 44:58.617
Uh... What am I...?

44:58.651 --> 45:00.050
Um...

45:01.417 --> 45:03.350
Dreams of youth?

45:03.384 --> 45:05.651
Yeah, that's, um...

45:08.517 --> 45:11.517
Sorry, what's, uh, up?
What's up?

45:11.551 --> 45:13.117
Are you ready for tomorrow?

45:13.150 --> 45:14.851
What's tomorrow?

45:14.884 --> 45:19.250
Tomorrow, yes, the Q2
presentation, of course. Um...

45:19.284 --> 45:21.851
- Yeah, um, I'm getting there.
- You're getting there?

45:21.884 --> 45:23.284
Yeah, I'm almost...
It'll be...

45:23.317 --> 45:24.784
- You're almost ready?
- Yeah.

45:28.450 --> 45:29.851
- Whoo.
- Could I steal you for a second?

45:29.884 --> 45:32.117
Sure, okay.

45:32.150 --> 45:35.517
I am sensing a lack of focus.

45:35.551 --> 45:39.417
Also, you have been late
three times this month.

45:39.450 --> 45:42.150
If it happens again, there will
have to be consequences.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.117
Sorry. Sorry.

45:46.150 --> 45:48.250
Um, no, I know,
I'm trying to, uh...

45:48.284 --> 45:50.484
I understand. I'll be better.

45:50.517 --> 45:53.150
You have to present
your Q2 report to the board.

45:53.183 --> 45:54.484
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow.

45:54.517 --> 45:55.651
- Mm-hm.
- Nine AM.

45:55.684 --> 45:58.717
- I know.
- Are you going to be ready?

45:58.751 --> 46:01.050
Yeah, I'm gonna be ready
for tomorrow. Mm-hm.

46:03.551 --> 46:06.417
Is that... Are you...
Is that all?

46:10.150 --> 46:12.651
Jesus, man, what?

46:12.684 --> 46:14.117
<i>I remember.</i>

46:26.851 --> 46:30.784
It... It was
right before final exams.

46:32.317 --> 46:35.617
Those weird fuckers
I used to grab off of...

46:35.651 --> 46:37.717
told us we could get uncut Merc.

46:37.751 --> 46:40.350
Yeah, you're sure
Cindy came with us?

46:40.384 --> 46:42.083
I don't remember this at all.

46:42.117 --> 46:43.851
I don't remember any party
or any...

46:43.884 --> 46:45.717
Then why the fuck are you here?

46:48.684 --> 46:51.150
Okay, can either of you guys
honestly tell me

46:51.183 --> 46:53.417
you ever remember seeing
Cindy after that night?

47:02.284 --> 47:05.417
We gotta go back.
We got to go back.

47:05.450 --> 47:08.284
We gotta... we gotta try to remember
what happened to her that night.

47:08.317 --> 47:11.384
We gotta retrace our steps.
We gotta remember.

47:12.484 --> 47:14.317
So, where did we go that night?

47:27.617 --> 47:28.817
It was a...

47:31.317 --> 47:33.250
It was a building,
it was like a...

47:35.117 --> 47:37.517
<i>old broken-down building.</i>

47:38.584 --> 47:40.284
Blackbird street.

47:42.817 --> 47:44.551
It was on Blackbird Street.

47:50.651 --> 47:52.517
No time like the present?

47:55.584 --> 47:57.317
No time like the present.

48:13.217 --> 48:14.717
<i>Do you know
where the fuck we're going?</i>

48:14.751 --> 48:16.684
I know where we're going!

48:50.551 --> 48:52.250
Here we are.

49:13.350 --> 49:14.584
Well, we saw it.

49:19.450 --> 49:20.651
Guys...

49:20.684 --> 49:22.317
Fred, no!

49:22.350 --> 49:24.784
There's absolutely
no reason to go in there.

49:36.350 --> 49:37.717
Fuck.

49:37.751 --> 49:40.284
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

50:13.217 --> 50:14.651
Squatters.

50:14.684 --> 50:16.284
What?

50:16.317 --> 50:18.417
Fucking bums, man.

50:36.884 --> 50:38.150
This is it.

50:40.117 --> 50:41.450
This is where it happened.

50:42.751 --> 50:44.651
I can't go in there.

50:46.384 --> 50:48.584
I-I can't go in that room.

50:50.417 --> 50:53.551
Okay. It's all right.
You guys stay here.

51:58.317 --> 51:59.651
Let's leave.

52:01.551 --> 52:03.450
Now. Let's just go.

52:07.484 --> 52:09.150
What do you know?

52:09.183 --> 52:11.817
You know something,
I know you do, tell me.

52:13.884 --> 52:15.584
I don't know. I just...

52:17.217 --> 52:18.751
I know that
we're supposed to be here.

52:20.651 --> 52:22.684
Well, well...

52:24.851 --> 52:27.284
Hundred percent pure.

52:29.217 --> 52:30.250
Shall we?

52:51.784 --> 52:53.651
Fuck. Let's not stay long.

53:11.851 --> 53:13.684
What are you doing?

53:13.717 --> 53:16.551
Stop pulling my ear.

53:16.584 --> 53:18.183
Stop.

53:19.284 --> 53:20.617
Okay, okay.

53:41.384 --> 53:42.617
Fuck it.

54:33.250 --> 54:35.183
Jesus, Andre, what the fuck?

54:35.217 --> 54:36.484
Listen to me, listen to
me, listen to me, listen to me.

54:36.517 --> 54:39.817
Don't...
Don't-don't take it, okay?

54:39.851 --> 54:41.651
- What?
- It's not what we think it is.

54:41.684 --> 54:43.083
And then
they're-they're everywhere.

54:43.117 --> 54:44.018
They're all over
the fucking place

54:44.050 --> 54:45.484
so we have to get
the fuck out of here.

54:45.517 --> 54:46.651
Who? Who are you talking about?

54:46.684 --> 54:48.350
The-the bums.

54:48.384 --> 54:50.150
The fucking bums
are in the fucking building.

54:50.183 --> 54:51.484
- Okay, we got to, we got to go.
- Calm down.

54:51.517 --> 54:52.651
Calm down.
You got to breathe. Okay?

54:52.684 --> 54:55.250
- Take a fucking breath.
- Oh, oh, shit.

54:55.284 --> 54:57.450
Shit, Andre.
What the fuck is happening?

54:57.484 --> 55:00.417
Fred, Fred, okay,
just-just whatever you do,

55:00.450 --> 55:01.817
just don't take it,
whatever you do.

55:01.851 --> 55:04.284
I already fucking took it, okay?

55:06.117 --> 55:08.684
What's going to happen to me?
Huh?

55:08.717 --> 55:09.817
Andre...

55:13.484 --> 55:15.784
Oh, shit, it's already
fucking happening to you!

55:42.617 --> 55:44.150
Music...

55:46.717 --> 55:48.551
Interpret...

55:50.350 --> 55:51.817
True...

56:37.217 --> 56:38.450
Your...

56:41.317 --> 56:42.784
Elaborate...

56:45.384 --> 56:47.183
State...

56:49.784 --> 56:51.584
What's wrong with him?

56:52.517 --> 56:53.651
And...

56:57.117 --> 56:58.717
Not a thing in the world.

56:59.651 --> 57:01.217
Trying...

57:03.417 --> 57:05.217
How much Merc is he on?

57:05.250 --> 57:06.350
Sane...

57:08.617 --> 57:10.417
A lot.

57:10.450 --> 57:12.250
Itself...

57:13.284 --> 57:15.217
He's just a kid.

57:15.250 --> 57:18.384
He's no more a kid
than you are an old man, man.

57:19.617 --> 57:21.217
True...

57:23.450 --> 57:25.050
Same...

57:27.484 --> 57:29.183
On...

57:30.751 --> 57:32.150
Invasive...

57:33.250 --> 57:34.250
As...

57:36.517 --> 57:38.050
Controlling...

57:41.284 --> 57:42.551
When...

57:43.617 --> 57:45.350
Temporarily...

57:49.183 --> 57:50.517
Eliminating...

57:54.584 --> 57:55.651
Consciousness...

57:57.117 --> 57:58.684
What are you all
still doing here?

57:59.584 --> 58:01.851
We never left.

58:01.884 --> 58:03.551
Neither did you.

58:07.851 --> 58:09.050
Fred...

58:25.817 --> 58:28.417
Here is still here.

58:32.117 --> 58:33.250
No...

58:34.284 --> 58:36.217
No, no, no. No!

58:36.250 --> 58:39.183
No! No! No!

58:39.217 --> 58:40.484
No, I need help!

58:40.517 --> 58:42.117
Tell them I need help!

58:42.150 --> 58:43.284
I took too much!

58:43.317 --> 58:45.450
It's okay, Fred.

58:45.484 --> 58:46.751
It's okay.

58:48.884 --> 58:50.250
It's okay.

58:51.417 --> 58:54.284
You're here. You're really here.

58:54.317 --> 58:56.751
Fred, I understand...

58:56.784 --> 58:59.651
I understand what the Merc
is doing to us.

58:59.684 --> 59:02.551
I thought I was back here...
here.

59:02.584 --> 59:04.384
I was older...

59:04.417 --> 59:06.817
It's not a matter
of one point being real

59:06.851 --> 59:08.150
and the other not.

59:08.183 --> 59:11.117
All points exist simultaneously.

59:11.150 --> 59:13.784
Try a small transition at first.

59:15.484 --> 59:18.584
Concentrate on your
experiences here.

59:19.450 --> 59:21.517
In this place.

59:25.551 --> 59:27.784
Memory...

59:27.817 --> 59:29.584
Are you talking about memory?

59:30.517 --> 59:32.417
Concentrate...

59:45.717 --> 59:48.217
Oh, shit. It's already
fucking happening to you!

59:52.384 --> 59:53.584
Oh, my God.

59:56.317 --> 59:58.183
It's not a memory.

59:59.651 --> 1:00:01.384
It's still happening.

1:00:02.150 --> 1:00:04.217
No! No, no!

1:00:04.250 --> 1:00:05.817
No, I don't believe it.

1:00:07.751 --> 1:00:09.350
What... What do you want from me?

1:00:09.384 --> 1:00:11.083
Fred.

1:00:18.517 --> 1:00:20.617
This is only one of my lives.

1:00:24.517 --> 1:00:29.350
One set of choices
and I exist in all of them.

1:00:29.884 --> 1:00:31.784
Simultaneously.

1:00:33.350 --> 1:00:36.284
I'm more free
than you could ever imagine.

1:00:40.117 --> 1:00:44.417
I've seen the skylines
of a thousand cities.

1:00:47.317 --> 1:00:51.484
I've looked into the eyes
of a hundred grandkids.

1:00:52.651 --> 1:00:55.617
The ones that I love the most,

1:00:55.651 --> 1:00:57.450
they look like you.

1:01:01.684 --> 1:01:03.384
Come with me.

1:01:06.417 --> 1:01:09.584
I'll show you
all the possibilities.

1:01:13.684 --> 1:01:15.050
How?

1:01:16.651 --> 1:01:18.250
Go with him.

1:01:19.717 --> 1:01:21.551
He'll show you the way.

1:01:25.717 --> 1:01:27.517
Itself...

1:01:29.551 --> 1:01:31.217
Color...

1:01:32.851 --> 1:01:34.384
Language...

1:01:34.417 --> 1:01:35.684
Control...

1:01:35.717 --> 1:01:36.817
Shape...

1:01:36.851 --> 1:01:38.450
Misinterpretation...

1:01:38.484 --> 1:01:39.684
On...

1:01:43.551 --> 1:01:46.417
The system you are using
to interpret reality

1:01:46.450 --> 1:01:48.584
is not one of your choosing.

1:01:48.617 --> 1:01:50.651
Numbers. Language. Color.

1:01:50.684 --> 1:01:51.784
Shape.

1:01:51.817 --> 1:01:53.183
All a misinterpretation

1:01:53.217 --> 1:01:55.284
of the information around you.

1:01:55.317 --> 1:01:57.484
A misinterpretation
imposed on you

1:01:57.517 --> 1:01:58.851
by an invasive life-form

1:01:58.884 --> 1:02:01.417
that is trying to control
your consciousness.

1:02:01.450 --> 1:02:02.817
The substance you ingested

1:02:02.851 --> 1:02:04.751
temporarily counteracts
the influence

1:02:04.784 --> 1:02:07.551
of the invasive life-form
that is trying to force you

1:02:07.584 --> 1:02:11.350
to perceive information
in the same manner as itself:

1:02:11.384 --> 1:02:12.817
in a linear fashion.

1:02:12.851 --> 1:02:16.317
To perceive choices
as having inescapable outcomes.

1:02:16.350 --> 1:02:18.350
Outcomes it has dictated to you,

1:02:18.384 --> 1:02:22.551
thereby controlling all of your choices
and, in effect, eliminating them.

1:02:22.584 --> 1:02:24.384
It achieves this goal
by influencing you

1:02:24.417 --> 1:02:27.484
to perceive the most elaborate
of all misinterpretations...

1:02:28.117 --> 1:02:29.183
Time.

1:03:30.417 --> 1:03:31.517
Fred.

1:03:32.817 --> 1:03:36.050
Fred! Fred, it's all right.

1:03:37.417 --> 1:03:38.817
Stay with me.

1:03:38.851 --> 1:03:41.384
Do you hear me?
Stay with me, Fred. Fred.

1:03:41.417 --> 1:03:43.717
Fred! Fred! Fight!

1:03:43.751 --> 1:03:47.350
Get off him! Let him go!
Fred, fight!

1:03:47.384 --> 1:03:48.651
- Let him...
- Fred...

1:03:55.851 --> 1:03:57.250
Fred!

1:03:57.284 --> 1:03:59.384
Get the fuck off of me!

1:03:59.417 --> 1:04:02.050
Fuck you! I'll fuck you up!

1:04:23.150 --> 1:04:24.484
Fashion...

1:04:25.817 --> 1:04:27.384
Influence...

1:04:29.117 --> 1:04:30.817
- Force...
- Hey, come on, Fred.

1:04:30.851 --> 1:04:34.217
Come on. Let's go!
Fuck. Come on, let's go!

1:04:34.250 --> 1:04:36.150
Fred, come on!

1:04:40.551 --> 1:04:41.651
Hey!

1:04:41.684 --> 1:04:43.284
Fred! Fred.

1:04:44.717 --> 1:04:48.117
Fr... Fred! Jesus Christ.
It's okay.

1:04:48.150 --> 1:04:49.484
Did you take something?

1:04:50.684 --> 1:04:52.651
Hey, hey, Fred.

1:04:52.684 --> 1:04:55.150
Hey!
Please.

1:04:58.317 --> 1:04:59.751
Fred?

1:04:59.784 --> 1:05:01.250
Honey?

1:05:01.284 --> 1:05:02.751
Are you all right?

1:05:02.784 --> 1:05:05.384
Fred!

1:05:05.417 --> 1:05:06.817
Open the door!

1:05:08.350 --> 1:05:09.517
Are you all right?

1:05:53.217 --> 1:05:56.050
Shit, shit, shit!

1:05:59.450 --> 1:06:01.517
Shit, shit, shit.

1:06:45.651 --> 1:06:46.717
Freddie.

1:07:01.250 --> 1:07:02.751
You're not gonna say anything?

1:07:03.884 --> 1:07:05.450
About yesterday?

1:07:11.150 --> 1:07:13.150
You have finals today.

1:07:14.517 --> 1:07:17.350
Do you know
how important that is?

1:07:17.384 --> 1:07:19.417
To your whole life.

1:07:25.751 --> 1:07:27.784
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1:08:36.684 --> 1:08:37.817
I'll be right there.

1:08:41.484 --> 1:08:44.350
Anyone not at their
desk in the next ten seconds

1:08:44.384 --> 1:08:46.784
will receive an automatic zero
on their exam

1:08:46.817 --> 1:08:48.384
and will not be graduating.

1:08:48.417 --> 1:08:49.784
If you think I'm bluffing
I encourage you

1:08:49.817 --> 1:08:51.684
to test that theory.

1:09:02.684 --> 1:09:07.751
All right, you will have
60 minutes beginning...

1:09:08.551 --> 1:09:10.083
now.

1:09:11.684 --> 1:09:14.517
...that specialize in
a multitude of areas of business

1:09:14.551 --> 1:09:16.217
so you can be
absolutely sure that...

1:09:16.250 --> 1:09:17.517
Fred Fitzell!

1:09:18.150 --> 1:09:19.284
Yeah?

1:09:19.317 --> 1:09:21.317
Could you present your Q2 report

1:09:21.350 --> 1:09:23.050
to the board, please?

1:09:23.784 --> 1:09:25.150
Now?

1:09:33.450 --> 1:09:35.317
So, we can see from...

1:09:36.484 --> 1:09:38.217
from the previous six quarters

1:09:38.250 --> 1:09:39.784
we can estimate that this...

1:09:40.617 --> 1:09:42.050
Q2 numbers...

1:09:43.284 --> 1:09:45.217
The Q2 numbers, uh...

1:10:15.784 --> 1:10:18.117
An invasive life-form
that is trying to force you

1:10:18.150 --> 1:10:21.817
to perceive information
in the same manner as itself:

1:10:21.851 --> 1:10:23.384
in a linear fashion.

1:10:24.350 --> 1:10:25.717
<i>Mr. Fitzell!</i>

1:10:34.684 --> 1:10:35.817
Fred!

1:10:42.817 --> 1:10:44.384
I can see it.

1:10:49.384 --> 1:10:52.350
Why are you even here right now?

1:10:52.384 --> 1:10:54.217
You've always been here,
huh, haven't you?

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:56.284
Where, where, where?

1:10:56.317 --> 1:10:59.217
I can feel you.

1:11:00.751 --> 1:11:03.217
I'm in your prison
right now, huh?!

1:11:03.250 --> 1:11:05.384
Aren't I?! I can feel it!

1:11:16.450 --> 1:11:17.417
Now.

1:11:19.117 --> 1:11:20.417
Now!

1:11:24.384 --> 1:11:25.751
None of this fucking matters!

1:11:25.784 --> 1:11:27.584
I didn't choose
this fucking life.

1:11:27.617 --> 1:11:30.217
None of you fucking move!

1:11:30.250 --> 1:11:31.617
Get him out of here now.
Get him out!

1:11:31.651 --> 1:11:33.417
I'll get my fucking self
out of here!

1:11:33.450 --> 1:11:37.117
I'm not even here!
I'm not even here right now!

1:11:38.517 --> 1:11:39.684
I'm not even here right...

1:11:39.717 --> 1:11:41.083
now.

1:11:58.817 --> 1:12:00.250
Be right there.

1:12:03.284 --> 1:12:04.551
Be right there.

1:12:14.584 --> 1:12:17.484
<i>Hello?</i>

1:12:17.517 --> 1:12:19.484
Hi, Mrs. Bellamy,
is Sebastian there?

1:12:19.517 --> 1:12:21.551
<i>He can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

1:12:21.584 --> 1:12:23.450
Okay, okay, when do you think
he'll be able to, uh...

1:12:23.484 --> 1:12:25.317
<i>He can't come
to the phone ever.</i>

1:12:26.751 --> 1:12:27.617
What? What do you mean?

1:12:27.651 --> 1:12:29.684
<i>I don't want you
around my boy anymore.</i>

1:12:29.717 --> 1:12:31.551
- <i>Goodbye.</i>
- Fred! Fred!

1:12:31.584 --> 1:12:35.183
What is going on?
The entire board is waiting inside.

1:12:42.417 --> 1:12:43.551
Now.

1:12:59.617 --> 1:13:01.484
- Yo.
- What's up?

1:13:01.517 --> 1:13:03.284
- Have you seen Cindy?
- No.

1:13:03.317 --> 1:13:06.217
Do you know if she
left with us last night?

1:13:06.250 --> 1:13:08.083
Dude, did she leave the
fucking party with us or not?

1:13:08.117 --> 1:13:10.350
I don't fucking know!
All right?

1:13:10.384 --> 1:13:12.350
You gentlemen
have somewhere to be?

1:13:12.384 --> 1:13:13.551
Where does she live?

1:13:14.851 --> 1:13:15.784
What?

1:13:15.817 --> 1:13:17.517
I said "Do you know
where she fucking lives?"

1:13:20.284 --> 1:13:22.284
Why are you asking that?

1:13:23.784 --> 1:13:26.350
Why do you...
Why do you care so much?

1:13:31.183 --> 1:13:32.450
Let's go!

1:13:42.817 --> 1:13:44.050
Now.

1:13:46.150 --> 1:13:48.217
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1:13:52.717 --> 1:13:53.717
Now.

1:13:55.551 --> 1:13:56.617
Freddie!

1:14:00.717 --> 1:14:02.551
Freddie!

1:14:02.584 --> 1:14:04.384
Freddie, come back!

1:14:05.651 --> 1:14:07.150
Freddie!

1:14:36.317 --> 1:14:37.517
Stop!

1:15:01.851 --> 1:15:03.117
<i>Fred.</i>

1:15:11.450 --> 1:15:13.083
I'm still here.

1:15:14.851 --> 1:15:17.050
You'll always be here.

1:15:22.684 --> 1:15:25.250
I thought you
needed me to save you.

1:15:28.150 --> 1:15:30.551
But it was you
trying to save me.

1:15:44.183 --> 1:15:45.183
Now.

1:16:38.217 --> 1:16:39.384
Where do you want to go?

1:16:43.450 --> 1:16:44.651
Everywhere.

1:18:13.817 --> 1:18:15.517
You finished another one.

1:19:35.450 --> 1:19:37.050
<i>You hear what I said?</i>

1:19:42.417 --> 1:19:44.083
We're almost out.

1:19:47.117 --> 1:19:48.484
I'll go out soon.

1:21:29.851 --> 1:21:31.784
I got you something today.

1:21:37.851 --> 1:21:39.417
What is it?

1:21:51.417 --> 1:21:53.083
It made me think of you.

1:21:57.784 --> 1:22:00.284
Now it'll make me
think of you too.

1:22:18.817 --> 1:22:20.284
It's okay.

1:22:21.617 --> 1:22:23.417
I'll find it again.

1:23:59.717 --> 1:24:01.150
Hi, Mom.

1:24:09.317 --> 1:24:11.751
I know you don't
remember me but, uh...

1:24:12.851 --> 1:24:14.417
I'm your son.

1:25:06.551 --> 1:25:08.050
It's you...

1:25:10.617 --> 1:25:11.684
It's you.

1:25:48.684 --> 1:25:50.517
Freddie! No!

1:25:50.551 --> 1:25:51.851
No!

1:26:01.817 --> 1:26:03.083
Freddie?

1:26:09.584 --> 1:26:10.817
What?

1:26:12.350 --> 1:26:13.817
Freddie?

1:26:20.684 --> 1:26:22.217
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:26:22.250 --> 1:26:23.751
This is you here?

1:26:23.784 --> 1:26:26.417
This is you.

1:26:26.450 --> 1:26:28.183
Yeah...

1:26:28.217 --> 1:26:31.317
- It's you?
- Yeah, it's me. It's me.

1:26:38.784 --> 1:26:40.617
It's me, it's me.

1:26:41.817 --> 1:26:43.250
It's me.

1:27:02.317 --> 1:27:03.317
<i>Fred.</i>

1:27:10.851 --> 1:27:12.217
Cindy.

1:27:17.784 --> 1:27:19.317
I can't.

1:27:24.417 --> 1:27:26.617
I can't follow you anymore.

1:27:29.517 --> 1:27:30.684
I know.

1:28:24.517 --> 1:28:26.150
How do you think you did?

1:28:28.617 --> 1:28:30.617
I think I gave them
what they wanted.

1:28:34.217 --> 1:28:35.350
I'm Karen.

1:28:38.350 --> 1:28:39.484
I'm Fred.

1:29:43.117 --> 1:29:44.083
Mom?

1:29:49.584 --> 1:29:51.150
Mom?

1:30:14.551 --> 1:30:16.117
<i>Freddie.</i>

1:30:20.751 --> 1:30:23.350
We don't go out there, right?

1:30:23.384 --> 1:30:25.183
Remember what
happened last time?

1:31:06.751 --> 1:31:08.584
You remembered!
