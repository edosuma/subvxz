.

00:03.233 --> 00:03.533
This is phenomenal.

00:05.033 --> 00:07.166
Do you really like it?
Just give it.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.400
I'll do another rewrite.

00:08.433 --> 00:10.033
No, no, no, no,
I wouldn't change a word.

00:10.066 --> 00:11.433
Maggie, don't blow smoke
up my ass.

00:11.433 --> 00:12.567
I'm already in the chimney.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.533
Ugh, Mom, why are you in
our living room?

00:14.567 --> 00:16.367
What are you doing
in your pajamas?

00:16.400 --> 00:17.767
It's 2:30 in the afternoon.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.400
I'll have you know that
I am not in my pajamas.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.166
These are my workout clothes

00:22.166 --> 00:23.400
that I slept in.

00:23.433 --> 00:26.400
Now what are you two besties
canoodling about?

00:26.433 --> 00:28.533
Your mother wrote
the most amazing play.

00:28.567 --> 00:31.567
It's called Cashmere Burka,
and it is a tour de force.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.166
(Emma)
Cashmere Burka?

00:33.166 --> 00:36.567
What's it about, a J.Crew
opening in Afghanistan?

00:36.567 --> 00:38.166
It's a metaphor,

00:38.200 --> 00:39.433
about the awakening
of a woman

00:39.467 --> 00:42.166
who's been trapped
by luxury her entire life.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.166
I like to think of it
as part of my "Gwennaissance."

00:44.200 --> 00:46.333
Yes, we're putting it up
at the JCC.

00:46.333 --> 00:49.600
And Maggie has done me
the great honor

00:49.600 --> 00:50.734
of agreeing to direct.

00:50.734 --> 00:52.467
Oh, my God, you have
honored me by asking.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.166
Oh, oh, the honor
is mine, Maggie.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.000
This is so gross,
what is happening right now.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.200
Just so you know.
Get a room.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.734
Okay, let's see this.

00:59.734 --> 01:02.033
Okay, why does it say
it's written by Nell Carter?

01:02.066 --> 01:03.200
Yes, that's my nom de plume.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.600
I thought it was
Phylicia Rashad.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.266
It's not the right time
for that name anymore.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.400
Well, just so you know,

01:07.433 --> 01:09.600
Nell Carter is also
a real person.

01:09.633 --> 01:10.667
Oh, give me a break.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.467
Yes, that was
the TV show she was on.

01:12.467 --> 01:13.734
- Who?
- Nell Carter.

01:13.767 --> 01:14.734
I was never on a show.

01:14.767 --> 01:16.200
Ugh, never mind.

01:16.233 --> 01:18.133
You know, Emma,
I was actually thinking of you

01:18.166 --> 01:20.066
for the part
of the young Glenn.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.300
Uh, I'm sorry,
slow your roll.

01:21.333 --> 01:24.166
You want me to play
a younger version of my mom?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.233
I don't think so.

01:25.233 --> 01:26.467
That is not a good idea.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.166
Don't worry about it.
I'll just ask Tina.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.767
[gasps]
The bird woman?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.600
Maggie, you can't give it
to Bird Bones!

01:31.633 --> 01:32.734
She is made of tissue paper.

01:32.767 --> 01:34.767
The stage lights would shine
right through her.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.633
I demand that
you play the role.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.467
And I demand
that you give it to me.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.467
Well, then I guess
I have no choice.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.100
Okay, I see what you did
just there.

01:45.100 --> 01:47.767
Who, me?
I'm just directing a play.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.734
And scene.

God, I am so excited
to be back

02:13.567 --> 02:16.200
with another season of
the Pinebrook Players.

02:16.233 --> 02:18.667
[cheers and applause]
- Yeah.

02:18.667 --> 02:21.400
We are very excited
to have this year's play,

02:21.433 --> 02:24.000
Cashmere Burka,
written by Nell Carter,

02:24.033 --> 02:26.233
AKA Gwen Crawford.

02:26.266 --> 02:27.600
So, we're just gonna
dive in and--

02:27.633 --> 02:29.467
I just want to
say a few words.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.767
Okay, yeah.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.233
When I began this journey,

02:32.266 --> 02:36.266
it never dawned on me
that we would be here

02:36.300 --> 02:39.000
in the Jewish Community Center.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.000
I always thought it would be
a bigger stage,

02:41.000 --> 02:42.600
like Broadway
or The West End

02:42.633 --> 02:44.667
or some theater
in Hartford,

02:44.700 --> 02:45.700
but here we are.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.433
Through your voices,

02:47.433 --> 02:51.133
I am finally going
to be able to hear my own.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.433
Shall we embrace?

02:52.467 --> 02:53.767
[chuckles]

02:57.066 --> 02:59.266
Okay, are we done
with the snuggles?

02:59.300 --> 03:01.166
Um...let's grab our scripts
and just, you know, hop--

03:01.166 --> 03:03.533
hop up on stage.

03:03.567 --> 03:06.000
[clears throat]

03:06.033 --> 03:08.033
Got your hands full
with that one, huh?

03:08.066 --> 03:09.400
Little dramatic,
don't you think?

03:09.433 --> 03:12.233
Nah, she's just, you know,
feeling nervous.

03:12.266 --> 03:14.166
All right,
well, just be warned,

03:14.200 --> 03:16.000
a storm is a-comin'.

03:16.033 --> 03:18.433
Okay, I think I got it
under control, but thank you.

03:18.433 --> 03:20.133
Hurricane Gwen
is a-comin',

03:20.166 --> 03:22.233
and you're the one
that's gonna get "whet."

03:22.266 --> 03:23.233
Don't say "whet."

03:23.266 --> 03:24.500
- Whet.
- Whet?

03:24.533 --> 03:26.533
Whet. Oh, that reminds me,
I gotta pee.

03:26.567 --> 03:28.467
I'm gonna take a five, okay?
Take a five, everybody.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.667
No, no, no, no,
we're not taking five.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.333
Mark, my knight
in shining armor.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.333
Oh, thank you.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.467
Maggie!
Maggie, Maggie.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.033
Meet Mark.
He's gonna be doing our sets.

03:37.066 --> 03:39.734
Yes, I know Mark.
Thank you for doing this again.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.667
Any excuse to get my
Bob Vila on.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.700
Hey, what's up with that
weird turtleneck?

03:43.734 --> 03:45.033
It's from Tina.

03:45.066 --> 03:47.066
She wants me to try
different necklines.

03:47.066 --> 03:49.200
So, that's what we're doing.

03:49.233 --> 03:50.467
- Excuse me, Mark.
- Mm-hmm.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.200
Did you get
the renovated plans?

03:52.233 --> 03:53.567
Renovated plans?
No, no, no.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.333
I'm already half done
with the set.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.467
Well, you're gonna have
to rip it down.

03:56.467 --> 03:57.600
I need a bay window.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.300
Do you know how difficult
that is to build?

03:59.333 --> 04:02.133
There's a lapdog soliloquy
that necessitates it.

04:02.166 --> 04:05.567
Maggie, I can't just whip up
a bay window.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.066
What would Vila do?

04:09.100 --> 04:11.500
He would make it work.

04:11.533 --> 04:13.500
[playful music]

04:13.533 --> 04:14.767
- There's a man in here!
- Oh, sorry.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.233
There's a man
in the ladies' room.

04:16.266 --> 04:18.033
- No, I'm sorry, I'll just--
- Wait, Emma?

04:18.066 --> 04:19.333
Dan?

04:19.367 --> 04:21.200
What are you doing
in the ladies' room?

04:21.233 --> 04:22.200
I'm a rabbi.

04:22.233 --> 04:24.033
- A rabbi? Really?
- Yeah.

04:24.066 --> 04:25.600
- Full-on rabbi.
- Yeah.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.166
So wait, I'm sorry, then
why are you in here, though,

04:28.200 --> 04:29.233
in the ladies' room?

04:29.266 --> 04:31.100
Sometimes we rabbis
help out at the JCC.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.500
Okay, that makes sense.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.033
Yeah.
So what about you?

04:34.066 --> 04:36.767
Are you just walking around
Jewish bathrooms all day?

04:36.767 --> 04:39.166
Actually, I just had to pee.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.433
Oh, I should let you
get to that.

04:40.467 --> 04:41.767
- Okay.
- Okay, sorry.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.300
Well, it was good to--
very good to see you.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.433
Good to see you too.
It was great.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.233
- You're looking great.
- Okay.

04:46.233 --> 04:48.633
Hey, you know what.
Do you still wanna go out?

04:48.667 --> 04:50.400
Yeah, I would love that.

04:50.433 --> 04:51.767
How about tonight?
I can pick you up right here.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.200
Not right here.
I mean, in--

04:53.233 --> 04:54.266
- Maybe in this stall.
- Sure.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.333
Out there, yeah.

04:55.367 --> 04:56.367
That sounds great.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.266
Great.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.667
Well, good to see you.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.533
I actually do
really have to pee.

05:01.567 --> 05:02.734
- So I'm just gonna--
- Get to it.

05:02.767 --> 05:04.200
Here, you know what,
you might need--

05:04.233 --> 05:06.333
- Oh, thank you.
- In case--I'm sorry.

05:06.367 --> 05:08.100
Come on.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.066
Ma, she's gonna be my wife
whether you like it or not.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.367
You're giving me a one-way
ticket to Palookaville.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.767
All right, great.
I'm gonna stop you there.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.400
You know what
I was thinking?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.633
Maybe we just do
a little less Brando.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.000
Why would I do that?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.233
Brando's the greatest actor
who ever lived.

05:22.266 --> 05:24.767
Yeah, yeah, but maybe you just
hide him deep inside

05:25.000 --> 05:27.633
so that no one can hear the way
that he speaks or sounds.

05:27.667 --> 05:31.033
Okay, yeah.
That's a good note.

05:31.033 --> 05:32.033
Thank you.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.233
Hey, Maggie, Maggie,

05:33.266 --> 05:34.233
you're not gonna believe
who I just ran into

05:34.266 --> 05:35.233
in the ladies' room.

05:35.266 --> 05:36.633
- Who?
- Breadman Dan.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.567
What?
What was he doing at the JCC?

05:38.567 --> 05:39.567
He's a rabbi.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.000
Breadman Dan is Rabbi Dan?

05:42.033 --> 05:44.533
Yep, and I've always had that
dream of being lifted up--

05:44.567 --> 05:46.300
On a chair at your wedding.
I'm aware, I'm aware.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.300
Yes! Yes!

05:47.333 --> 05:49.000
(Gwen)
Ladies!

05:49.033 --> 05:52.233
Did someone call a ten?

05:52.266 --> 05:53.533
Um, why don't we take it

05:53.567 --> 05:55.300
from the "Nantucket
Never You Mind" speech.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.433
Do you have any questions
about the text?

05:57.433 --> 05:58.700
Oh, was I supposed
to read it?

05:58.700 --> 06:01.266
- Just get onstage.
- Okay.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.567
Oh, tight hammies.

06:02.567 --> 06:04.500
Can I borrow that?
Thank you so much.

06:04.533 --> 06:06.433
Unbelievable!

06:06.467 --> 06:07.533
[both laughing]

06:07.567 --> 06:09.033
- I don't know, I just--
- What?

06:09.066 --> 06:11.033
I think it's crazy
that you're a rabbi.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.133
Yeah? Why?

06:12.166 --> 06:13.133
I don't know,
you just don't meet

06:13.166 --> 06:14.200
many young, hot rabbis.

06:14.233 --> 06:16.200
Kinda picture 'em more like
old fat guys,

06:16.200 --> 06:18.133
like Harvey Fierstein.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.600
Sure, yeah.
Well, we set the bar there,

06:19.633 --> 06:21.700
so that I can just
skip right above him.

06:21.734 --> 06:23.467
Full disclosure, most of
what I know about Judaism,

06:23.500 --> 06:25.200
I learned from
a seventh-grade production

06:25.233 --> 06:26.333
of Fiddler on the Roof.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.300
And he's not even
a rabbi.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.433
Wait, what is he?

06:28.467 --> 06:30.166
He's a fiddler.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.166
- Well, that changes everything.
- I know.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.333
By the way,
there's plenty of time

06:33.367 --> 06:35.066
for me to become
that big fat rabbi

06:35.066 --> 06:36.266
that you've been
dreaming of,

06:36.300 --> 06:38.300
if I continue eating
the cheese the way I am.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.033
Yeah, you're really
putting it away.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.433
I feel like I've met
my match cheese-wise.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.200
[both chuckle]

06:47.200 --> 06:49.300
What, do I have cheese on me?

06:49.333 --> 06:52.166
Um, yeah,
I think right here.

06:56.767 --> 06:57.767
A little bit actually--

06:58.000 --> 06:59.233
Yeah, is that--
Right there?

06:59.266 --> 07:00.233
Yeah, right there.

07:00.266 --> 07:01.734
Oh, okay.
Did you get it?

07:01.767 --> 07:03.066
Yeah, yeah, I got--

07:03.100 --> 07:04.100
Is there some right there?

07:04.133 --> 07:05.166
Got some down there
a little bit, too.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.367
Okay.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.200
Yeah, I should actually
check that out.

07:08.233 --> 07:09.333
Better check it out.

07:09.367 --> 07:10.633
Do a full cheese inspection.

07:10.633 --> 07:13.000
Cheese check.

07:15.233 --> 07:17.333
Oh, what a rush.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.734
Hearing those thespians
give life to my words--

07:19.767 --> 07:21.066
And what about Ian?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.633
I mean, once he got
the Brando out of his system,

07:22.667 --> 07:24.233
he was really connected.

07:24.266 --> 07:25.600
And you're the one
that did that.

07:25.633 --> 07:26.600
Oh.

07:26.633 --> 07:28.467
Hello, Gwendolyn.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.200
Oh, Betty.
This is my dear friend, Maggie.

07:30.233 --> 07:31.734
Maggie, this is
my dear friend Betty.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.467
- Oh, it's a pleasure.
- It's nice to meet you, Maggie.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.000
- You too.
- So, how are things?

07:36.033 --> 07:39.066
We haven't seen much of you
around the ladies' club.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.500
Well, just the same.
Nothing happening.

07:40.533 --> 07:42.333
Just same old, same old.

07:42.367 --> 07:44.400
Are you coming to see
the play Gwen wrote?

07:44.400 --> 07:47.266
Gwen?
Gwen wrote a play?

07:47.266 --> 07:48.367
Oh, it's nothing.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.333
Oh, come on!
You're selling yourself short.

07:50.367 --> 07:51.333
It's phenomenal.

07:51.367 --> 07:52.667
It's called Cashmere Burka,

07:52.700 --> 07:54.633
and it's all about
Gwen's life.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.333
Well, I'm sure you have
a prior commitment.

07:56.367 --> 07:58.367
Oh, no, on the contrary,

07:58.400 --> 08:01.667
I wouldn't miss it
for anything in the world.

08:01.700 --> 08:05.066
- It's nice to meet you, Maggie.
- Oh, you too, yes.

08:05.100 --> 08:08.066
Gwen, enjoy your
chicken salad.

08:10.567 --> 08:12.266
- That's weird.
- How could you do that?

08:12.266 --> 08:14.133
- Do what?
- Tell her about the play.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.734
There's a reason those flyers
all say Nell Carter on them.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.667
Okay, but didn't you just say
that she was your dear friend?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.166
She is not a dear friend.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.700
I hate her with every fiber
of my being.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.433
This is a disaster.

08:25.433 --> 08:26.400
[sighs]

08:26.433 --> 08:28.166
I'm gonna go.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.700
Wait, Gwen.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.433
Actually, I'm gonna stay.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.166
I think you should be
the one who leaves.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.533
Me?

08:36.567 --> 08:40.033
Goodness.

08:40.066 --> 08:41.400
Okay.

08:41.433 --> 08:45.000
What is--okay.

08:45.033 --> 08:46.533
Don't know what's happening.

08:51.600 --> 08:51.734
.

08:52.033 --> 08:52.266
You were there.

08:52.266 --> 08:52.667
You were there.
I was standing right there.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.100
You said you wanted
a bay window.

08:55.133 --> 08:56.400
No, I asked for a window
overlooking a French bay.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.667
Okay, well, you know what
we're gonna do?

08:57.700 --> 08:59.066
We're gonna figure it out,
right?

08:59.100 --> 09:00.600
How are we possibly
gonna figure this out?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.567
Mark is trying
to ruin my play.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.667
Plus, look at this.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.700
He is stealing complete focus
with that V-neck.

09:05.734 --> 09:07.467
Do you think that
I want to wear this?

09:07.467 --> 09:08.533
- [sighs]
- Okay, all right.

09:08.567 --> 09:09.567
Unbelievable!

09:09.600 --> 09:12.000
Oh, and now this.

09:12.033 --> 09:14.133
Our lead actress
shows up late,

09:14.166 --> 09:15.567
with sex hair.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.133
So sorry.
I do, though.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.166
I do have sex hair.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.200
Okay, you know what,

09:19.233 --> 09:20.333
you need to get up here
right now.

09:20.367 --> 09:21.533
Sorry.
So sorry.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.734
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen,
listen to me, okay?

09:23.767 --> 09:25.166
I don't want to brag,

09:25.200 --> 09:28.166
but in 1999 I cast a woman
in a wheelchair as Peter Pan.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.567
And you know
what they said to me?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.734
"She'll never fly.
You can't do it.

09:31.767 --> 09:35.200
You can't lift that
metal chair up into the sky."

09:35.200 --> 09:37.300
But damn it, she flew.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.300
Nice story.
Can we rehearse?

09:39.333 --> 09:41.700
Yes, absolutely.
Let's dive in.

09:41.734 --> 09:43.200
Okay, here we go.

09:43.233 --> 09:44.633
Words.
Let's do this, people.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.633
Act one.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.367
Here's your martini, Daddy.

09:47.367 --> 09:49.433
Ugh, line?

09:49.467 --> 09:50.700
- Sorry.
- How was your day?

09:50.734 --> 09:52.300
Okay, I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it, okay.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.734
- You asked for a line.
- I didn't need it though.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.467
Okay.
Here's your martini, Daddy.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.200
How was your day?

09:59.233 --> 10:00.467
I wanna go to college
or something--

10:00.500 --> 10:01.600
Sorry, I'm gonna stop you.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.100
You're supposed
to be off-book.

10:03.133 --> 10:04.467
You're supposed
to be off-book.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.100
I am, I am, but I'm just,
like, taking a moment--

10:06.133 --> 10:07.600
You're not. You don't know
any of your lines.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.333
- I do, I know--
- You do not know a single line.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.734
This is how De Niro does it.
He takes it, he lives in it.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.333
It's not.
He's De Niro though.

10:13.367 --> 10:15.100
Okay, let's take--
can we take it from the top?

10:15.100 --> 10:16.333
Would that be okay?

10:16.367 --> 10:17.367
(Maggie)
Is there anyone else
in this scene, Emma?

10:17.367 --> 10:18.600
You're basically
still at the top.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.433
All right, ready?
From the top.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.467
Daddy?

10:22.500 --> 10:24.266
Daddy, are you there?

10:24.300 --> 10:27.600
It's me, Glenn.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.233
- Line.
- Oh, my God.

10:29.266 --> 10:30.333
"How was your day?"

10:30.367 --> 10:32.433
How was your day?

10:34.100 --> 10:35.066
Are we doing--

10:35.100 --> 10:36.767
Are we doing the whole--

10:37.000 --> 10:39.200
(both)
I can't--I seriously cannot--

10:39.233 --> 10:40.500
I'm not gonna feed you--

10:40.533 --> 10:42.367
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

10:42.400 --> 10:43.367
That's it!

10:43.400 --> 10:45.734
I have an announcement to make.

10:45.767 --> 10:47.667
In order for a play to work,

10:47.667 --> 10:51.133
every piece
must play its part.

10:51.166 --> 10:54.600
However, in our play,
we have a piece that is broken,

10:54.633 --> 10:57.000
and perhaps not wearing
enough blush.

10:57.033 --> 11:01.000
Therefore, I will now be
taking over the part of Glenn.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
- What?
- What?

11:02.000 --> 11:06.367
Emma, thank you
for your time.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.233
Wait, you're not
seriously firing me.

11:08.266 --> 11:09.567
I don't think
this is a good idea.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.700
I have made my decision.

11:13.567 --> 11:15.533
Emma, thank you
for your time.

11:15.567 --> 11:16.533
[scoffs]

11:16.567 --> 11:19.700
Oh, this--
this is rich.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.400
I get it!

11:21.433 --> 11:23.700
- Okay.
- Enjoy getting "whet."

11:23.700 --> 11:25.266
Come on, man.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.100
(Dan)
You were fired
by your own mom?

11:27.133 --> 11:28.400
I'm actually relieved.

11:28.433 --> 11:30.166
There were so many lines
about bone loss.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.700
It felt like a Boniva ad.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.567
Hey, I like you.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.400
Oh, okay.
We're doing this?

11:35.433 --> 11:37.567
Well, yes, yeah,
we're gonna do this now.

11:37.567 --> 11:40.533
Okay, well,
I really like you too.

11:40.567 --> 11:44.266
One of the many fun
complications of dating a rabbi

11:44.300 --> 11:46.467
is that I have, like,
300 people in my congregation,

11:46.467 --> 11:48.300
all of whom really like
to get up in my business.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.600
So you wanna
keep it quiet?

11:50.600 --> 11:52.467
Just for now.
Is that--is that okay?

11:52.500 --> 11:54.266
Oh, my God,
music to my ears.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.300
Yeah?

11:55.333 --> 11:56.400
I don't need a bunch
of Jewish moms

11:56.433 --> 11:57.467
kibbutzing about
my business.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.700
- "Kibitzing."
- Whatever.

11:58.734 --> 12:01.200
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.300
(Maggie)
This is the way the ladies ride.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.533
Trit-trot.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.333
Oh, this is awkward.

12:06.367 --> 12:08.567
I didn't expect
to run into you here.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.533
In our house
where we live?

12:10.567 --> 12:12.066
Listen, Emma, I'm sorry.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.667
I had no idea
she was gonna do that.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.066
You certainly didn't
try to stop it.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.467
Well, I wish you
all the best

12:17.467 --> 12:18.667
on your theatrical success,

12:18.700 --> 12:20.200
and I do hope
that Charlotte and I

12:20.200 --> 12:22.000
can keep in touch
from time to time.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.467
Okay, can you just shut up
for a second?

12:23.500 --> 12:25.000
- I need your help.
- What?

12:25.033 --> 12:26.700
Your mother has been
spinning out ever since

12:26.734 --> 12:28.033
the other night at dinner,

12:28.066 --> 12:29.367
and I have no idea
what's going on.

12:29.367 --> 12:30.633
Well, what happened
at dinner?

12:30.633 --> 12:33.100
I don't know, this woman
came over, Betty Gilbert.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.567
Oh, no.
Did she say anything weird?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.333
Yeah, when she
was leaving she said,

12:36.367 --> 12:38.066
"Enjoy your chicken salad."

12:38.100 --> 12:39.300
Oh, my God, this is bad.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.367
This is, like,
really, really bad.

12:41.367 --> 12:42.633
What?

12:42.633 --> 12:45.600
Sit with me.

12:45.633 --> 12:49.300
In 1984, my mother was put
in charge of the food

12:49.333 --> 12:50.633
at the annual garden party.

12:50.633 --> 12:51.734
Why are you using
that voice?

12:51.767 --> 12:53.567
And she was so nervous

12:53.600 --> 12:55.567
that she outsourced
the chicken salad

12:55.600 --> 12:58.500
to a new Mexican restaurant
she'd heard about

12:58.533 --> 13:00.500
on the other side of town.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.700
El Charro's.

13:01.734 --> 13:02.734
That means "cowboy."

13:02.767 --> 13:04.066
Within minutes
of the party,

13:04.100 --> 13:05.433
she knew something
was terribly wrong.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.600
Oh, no.

13:06.633 --> 13:09.066
40 women crapping themselves
through Coco Chanel skirts

13:09.100 --> 13:10.600
is a real game changer.

13:10.633 --> 13:11.734
Ooh.

13:11.767 --> 13:13.266
My mother's never been able
to live it down.

13:13.266 --> 13:15.000
Poor Gwen.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.266
- Oh, no, no, no, you can't.
- Why?

13:16.266 --> 13:18.400
No, WASPs never talk about
their problems.

13:18.433 --> 13:19.767
We just push it all down.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.533
We repress, repress, repress,
and then we explode.

13:22.533 --> 13:23.667
That doesn't make any sense.

13:23.700 --> 13:24.667
You don't make any sense!

13:24.700 --> 13:26.400
- Hey.
- Sorry.

13:26.433 --> 13:27.667
[banging]

13:27.700 --> 13:29.533
Hey, hey, hey,
popped collar.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.233
What is--what's--
what's happening?

13:31.266 --> 13:33.400
She wants me to build
a huge 12-foot, like,

13:33.400 --> 13:35.266
lady's, you know--
[whistles]

13:35.300 --> 13:37.000
- You know what I mean?
- No.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.633
Maggie, you know, the thing--
The hairy oyster.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.533
- I do not know.
- The star and its fruit.

13:41.533 --> 13:43.133
The barn doors
where the baby come out.

13:43.133 --> 13:44.233
Just say it, man.

13:44.266 --> 13:45.500
Just say what
you're trying to say.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.066
Here, just look at it
yourself.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.200
- Here.
- Okay.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.166
This is what
she wants me to build.

13:50.166 --> 13:51.166
Why?

13:51.166 --> 13:54.300
Because she's lost her mind!

13:54.300 --> 13:57.300
Ma, she's gonna be my wife
whether you like it or not.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.300
No, I don't like it.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.133
I don't like it one bit.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.433
Oh!

14:03.467 --> 14:05.433
There you go.
There you go!

14:05.467 --> 14:06.700
Oh, son!

14:06.700 --> 14:09.567
Oh, my God, why is
Ian motorboating Candy?

14:09.600 --> 14:12.000
This is supposed to be
a mother/son scene.

14:12.033 --> 14:14.300
We need sex.
We need to push some boundaries.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.000
I mean, everybody is bored!

14:16.033 --> 14:18.300
Okay, you know what, I
understand that you are scared.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.400
Oh, pfft!

14:19.433 --> 14:20.533
But you need to trust me.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.700
I am the director,
and you wrote a beautiful play,

14:22.734 --> 14:25.033
which is what
I would like to put on.

14:25.033 --> 14:27.400
If you think that there really
is nothing wrong with this play,

14:27.433 --> 14:31.000
then I don't think that you're
the right director anymore.

14:31.033 --> 14:32.333
Thank you for your time.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.700
Okay, no, no, no, no.

14:33.734 --> 14:34.700
No?

14:34.734 --> 14:37.433
This is not how this
is gonna roll out.

14:37.467 --> 14:39.433
Thank you for your time.

14:39.467 --> 14:41.033
I'm gonna thank you
for your time.

14:41.066 --> 14:43.000
No, because I am thanking you
for your time.

14:43.033 --> 14:44.734
No, I'm thanking you
for your time, okay?

14:44.734 --> 14:46.567
- No, no, thank you.
- And you know what?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.667
I get it, I get it,
there's a storm.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.066
We're in the center
of a hurricane.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.567
But I'm not gonna get "whet."

14:52.600 --> 14:55.533
I'm just gonna
ride in the eye, okay?

14:55.567 --> 14:57.300
You're the one that's
gonna get "whet."

14:57.333 --> 15:00.734
I assure you, Maggie,
I am dry as a bone.

15:00.734 --> 15:04.433
Whet, whet, whet!

15:04.467 --> 15:07.533
Maggie!

15:07.567 --> 15:09.166
Uh, I don't think
that's in the script.

15:13.533 --> 15:13.667
.

15:13.734 --> 15:14.100
(Maggie)

15:14.100 --> 15:14.500
(Maggie)
God, how dare she, you know?

15:15.767 --> 15:17.333
I mean, you give someone
the best of yourself,

15:17.367 --> 15:19.100
and then they just
throw it in the garbage?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.600
I'm gonna transition
back to being a good friend

15:20.633 --> 15:23.100
in just a second, but can
I just relish for a moment

15:23.133 --> 15:24.467
that you are
finally experiencing

15:24.500 --> 15:26.367
what I've had to deal with
my entire life?

15:26.367 --> 15:29.233
Hey, this is not funny, okay?
Your mother is my friend.

15:29.233 --> 15:30.567
Hey, hey, listen to me.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.367
You think this
actually means something?

15:32.367 --> 15:36.166
She has fired me as her
own daughter multiple times.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.633
Well, that's not nice, okay?

15:37.633 --> 15:39.300
It's not how
I was with my mom,

15:39.333 --> 15:42.600
and it's definitely not how
I want to be with my friends.

15:42.633 --> 15:44.200
You know what's gonna be
the weirdest part?

15:44.233 --> 15:46.066
Is sitting front row
of a show that I'm not even--

15:46.100 --> 15:47.367
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no.

15:47.367 --> 15:48.734
No, no, that's the only
good thing about this happening.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.300
We don't have to go.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.467
We can throw in Bull Durham
and have the night of our lives.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.467
Oh, we're going.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.567
A young Susan Sarandon,

15:54.600 --> 15:56.767
ping-ponging between
Costner and Robbins.

15:57.000 --> 15:57.767
It's spring break.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.667
Who's she gonna
have sex with, Maggie?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.133
Answer: Both of them.

16:01.166 --> 16:02.266
I'm gonna tell you,
it doesn't hold up.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.600
How dare you!

16:03.633 --> 16:05.600
Put on a dress.
We're going to your mom's show.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.000
[whimpers]

16:07.000 --> 16:09.233
(Emma)
I had to triple-Spanx myself.

16:09.266 --> 16:10.233
Great.
I'm happy for you.

16:10.266 --> 16:11.400
Where's the fat
gonna escape?

16:11.400 --> 16:12.633
I'm afraid.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.133
I don't know.
Oh, there's your rabbi.

16:14.133 --> 16:17.000
- Wanna...okay.
- Oh, yeah, let's say hi.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.066
Oh, sorry.
Hey, Dan.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.533
Hey.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.333
Good to see you.

16:23.367 --> 16:25.667
Uh, Emma,
good to see you.

16:25.700 --> 16:26.667
Maggie?

16:26.700 --> 16:28.734
Yeah.

16:28.767 --> 16:30.667
It's supposed to be a good show,
so enjoy it.

16:30.667 --> 16:33.467
- Yeah, she--
- Thank you.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.000
- That was super weird.
- Yeah--

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
We have a situation.

16:37.033 --> 16:38.133
What's up?

16:38.166 --> 16:39.433
Gwen's locked herself
in the bathroom.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.700
- Oh, God.
- What?

16:40.734 --> 16:42.433
And I keep on knocking,
and she just keeps on saying,

16:42.433 --> 16:44.367
"Ocupado, Jorge, ocupado."

16:44.400 --> 16:46.000
I mean, does she think
my name's Jorge?

16:46.033 --> 16:47.667
- Oh, that's is a--
- On the back?

16:47.700 --> 16:49.300
- That's too deep a V.
- Oh.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.233
[knocking]
- Gwen, it's Maggie.

16:51.266 --> 16:54.233
Can you open the door?
It's a safe space.

16:54.266 --> 16:58.300
Hey, cut the crap
and let us in, Mom!

16:58.333 --> 17:00.400
- All right, God.
- Come on.

17:02.133 --> 17:04.433
[sighs]
What are you doing?

17:04.433 --> 17:05.700
Oh, hello.

17:05.734 --> 17:08.033
Is the theater cleared?
Is everyone gone?

17:08.066 --> 17:09.667
No, they're waiting
to see the play.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.166
I've decided I'm not interested
in doing the play.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.033
This is classic.
This is so dramatic.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.433
Just--will you cut the shit
and just get out--

17:15.433 --> 17:17.433
- Hey, go in the stall.
- Why?

17:17.433 --> 17:18.667
You're making it worse.
Go in the stall.

17:18.700 --> 17:19.734
I don't wanna
go in the stall.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.200
Just go in the stall.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.200
Oh, God.

17:28.033 --> 17:29.667
Gwen, you have
nothing to worry about.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.133
The show is great.
It's gonna--

17:31.166 --> 17:32.433
No, it is not great!

17:32.467 --> 17:34.200
And you have been filling me
with false hope.

17:34.233 --> 17:35.333
No, I haven't.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.567
Telling me that I'm good
when I'm not.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.667
You are good.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.033
And now Betty and that crew
of cronies of hers,

17:39.066 --> 17:40.133
they're waiting outside,

17:40.166 --> 17:42.133
waiting for me
to serve them chicken salad.

17:42.166 --> 17:44.166
Oh, my God,
what is the deal

17:44.200 --> 17:46.533
with you guys
and the chicken salad?

17:46.567 --> 17:47.734
You know, women like
Betty Gilbert,

17:47.734 --> 17:49.200
you know what they do?

17:49.233 --> 17:50.734
They sit back and wait for
other people to take risks,

17:50.767 --> 17:52.333
and then they judge them.

17:52.333 --> 17:55.066
But you, you my friend,
are putting yourself out there,

17:55.066 --> 17:57.600
and that is super scary
and awesome.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.667
She's right, Mom.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.700
I am not brave
the way the two of you are.

18:00.734 --> 18:02.567
I could never raise
a baby on my own.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.500
I could never move
to another country.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.033
I could never spend the day
in my pajamas.

18:07.066 --> 18:08.100
They're workout clothes!

18:08.100 --> 18:10.166
I was planning on
working out.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.633
Gwen, we're only able
to do that stuff

18:11.667 --> 18:13.333
because the women
who raised us

18:13.367 --> 18:15.300
were such secret badasses.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.100
And, Mom, you are brave.

18:18.133 --> 18:20.233
Okay, you wrote this play.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.767
I've never written a play.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.767
And guess what,
it's really good.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.100
Well, it's too late.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.300
I've ruined the script.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.500
It's never too late.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.767
And I'll tell you what
we're gonna do.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.200
We're gonna do
a staged reading

18:30.233 --> 18:31.333
of the original play.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.333
No sets.
Scripts in hand.

18:33.367 --> 18:37.066
And, uh, P.S. I saw
Betty Gilbert on the way in.

18:37.100 --> 18:39.767
She was wearing
a sleeveless linen tunic.

18:39.767 --> 18:42.200
Oh, she doesn't have
the upper arms for that.

18:42.233 --> 18:43.333
Looked like cottage cheese.

18:43.367 --> 18:47.133
Tell them lights up in five!

18:47.166 --> 18:48.667
[applause]

18:48.667 --> 18:51.100
Thank you all for coming.

18:51.133 --> 18:54.633
It has been quite
a journey to this stage.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.767
Emma and Maggie,
my two daughters,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.266
helped me take
the last steps.

19:01.266 --> 19:06.133
So without further ado,
I give you Cashmere Burka.

19:06.133 --> 19:08.033
[applause]

19:10.533 --> 19:12.400
[indistinct chatter]

19:12.433 --> 19:15.266
- Emma.
- Oh, hey, Dan.

19:15.266 --> 19:17.367
Hey, it was really--
it was great.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.633
Oh, thanks.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.500
Um, hey, I normally
wouldn't mention this,

19:21.533 --> 19:25.000
but can I just say
when I said hi to you earlier,

19:25.033 --> 19:26.567
I didn't really like
how that felt.

19:26.567 --> 19:28.033
Me neither.
That was--

19:28.033 --> 19:31.233
I shook your hand,
like I was giving you a diploma.

19:31.266 --> 19:34.533
No, I paused like we were taking
a picture for the newspaper.

19:34.567 --> 19:35.567
I know I'm a rabbi and all,

19:35.567 --> 19:36.767
but if I get
a little kibitzing

19:37.000 --> 19:38.166
for canoodling
with a shiksa,

19:38.200 --> 19:39.567
then so be it,
all right?

19:39.567 --> 19:41.033
All right, well,
mazels to that.

19:41.033 --> 19:42.300
- Yeah.
- Did I say that right?

19:42.333 --> 19:43.700
- You said it perfectly.
- Okay.

19:43.734 --> 19:45.433
Gwen.

19:45.467 --> 19:47.000
Betty.

19:47.033 --> 19:49.500
Well, that play
was a tad too raw

19:49.533 --> 19:51.133
for my taste.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.033
Just like the chicken salad
I served you in 1984,

19:53.033 --> 19:54.300
wouldn't you say?

19:54.300 --> 19:55.567
Well...

19:55.600 --> 19:57.633
Oh, Betty,
thank you for coming.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.133
Your support
mean the world to me.

19:59.166 --> 20:02.367
Well, you're--
you're very welcome.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.667
I...

20:04.700 --> 20:06.266
Bye.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.200
Feels good, right?

20:09.233 --> 20:12.467
Yes, it does.

20:12.467 --> 20:15.133
Did you see her upper arms?
They're like cottage cheese.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.467
Gwen, what are you talk--
they're stunning.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.433
Just give me this.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.166
Okay.
Cottage cheese, it is.

20:25.266 --> 20:25.400
.

20:25.467 --> 20:26.066
Here's your martini, Daddy.

20:27.066 --> 20:28.266
Mommy said to bring it to you.

20:28.300 --> 20:31.600
I don't want to...disturb you.

20:31.633 --> 20:33.333
I can't marry you.

20:33.367 --> 20:36.667
Don't you understand, your
body came back from the war,

20:36.700 --> 20:42.333
but your heart--your heart
is still fighting the Viet Cong.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.567
So you can keep your what ifs

20:44.600 --> 20:46.734
and your why nots

20:46.734 --> 20:50.033
and your coulda beens
and your shoulda nevers.

20:50.066 --> 20:53.300
Mrs. Clawforge,
your mother is dead.

20:53.333 --> 20:56.333
[screams]
