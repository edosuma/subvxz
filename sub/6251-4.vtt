fit in with the neighborhood.

and it made everybody mad.

they were pretty ugly.

a noble cause.

the wrong way sometimes.

peed on the wind turbine,

07:20.774 --> 07:24.187
Would it have anything to do
with the pebbles embedded
in the remains?

07:24.278 --> 07:28.066
If by “pebbles” you mean the
rudaceous sedimentary stratified
clast fragments, then yes.

07:28.157 --> 07:31.194
Now, based on
the amount of pyrites,

07:31.285 --> 07:36.279
I’d estimate the porosity
at approximately 25%.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.534

for moisture saturation.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.708

so quaintly call them,

07:43.881 --> 07:46.463
were all found on the same
strata as the human remains,

07:46.550 --> 07:48.506
most likely dragged
from the murder site.

07:48.594 --> 07:50.835

embedded in the remains.

It sounded racist.

the fact that Arastoo
said he was Iranian,

his accent was Jordanian.

that he was faking
an Arab accent of any kind?

because he poisoned our dog?

- Kurt did not poison our dog.
- Yes, he did.

11:43.537 --> 11:47.871
Rocky peed on his stupid

our dog chocolate laxatives.

Dogs don’t react to that

- Yes. Micro fragments.

Neither blow’s anywhere near
a major vein or artery.

the amount of blood

23:00.630 --> 23:04.373

from an environment
where he flourishes...

23:04.467 --> 23:07.379

Impotent, he actually
becomes Impotent.

so bad, why didn’t you just
move back to the city?

found you with the gardener?
Nothing.

Did Kurt threaten
to tell your husband

23:25.572 --> 23:27.779
- Oh, no. He wouldn’t dare.
- Why not?

23:27.865 --> 23:31.608
Wait. You think
that Kurt told my husband
about the gardener,

with that 7 8— year-old girl.
