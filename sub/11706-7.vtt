06:51.702 --> 06:53.538
{\an8}- I HAD A REASON
TO [bleep] ON YOU IN MIAMI.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.872
{\an8}REALIZE THAT.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.251
{\an8}- I NEED A [bleep] HOT GUY
RIGHT NOW.

06:58.334 --> 07:01.337
{\an8}- I'M GOING TO GET RON BACK
THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.968
{\an8}- WHERE'S MIKE?

07:07.051 --> 07:10.179
{\an8}I GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT
WITH THAT [bleep].

07:10.263 --> 07:11.264
{\an8}- YOU GUYS WANNA GET FOOD?

07:11.347 --> 07:12.890
{\an8}ANYBODY WANNA
GO DO DINNER ANYWHERE?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.183
{\an8}- ASK SAM,
SINCE THAT'S YOUR FRIEND.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.936
{\an8}- WE'RE ALL FRIENDS.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.021
{\an8}- NO, THAT'S YOUR FRIEND,
OBVIOUSLY.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.314
{\an8}I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR BOY.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.483
{\an8}- YOU ARE MY BOY.
- YOU PLAYED ME OUT, BRO.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.735
{\an8}- OH, GET OUTTA HERE, BRO.
I NEVER PLAYED YOU OUT.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.362
{\an8}- I SAW WHAT I SAW,
AND IT WAS [bleep] WRONG.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.114
{\an8}WHAT YOU DID WAS WRONG.
- WHAT WAS IT?

07:28.197 --> 07:31.701
{\an8}- WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HER?

07:31.784 --> 07:32.660
{\an8}- IF I THINK
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

07:32.743 --> 07:34.537
{\an8}I WAS LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT, SAM?

07:34.620 --> 07:35.872
{\an8}YOU SHOULD BE BY YOURSELF,"

07:35.955 --> 07:37.290
{\an8}AND I'M TELLING YOU
YOU SHOULD BE BY YOURSELF,

07:37.373 --> 07:38.207
{\an8}'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
IT'S HEALTHY

07:38.291 --> 07:39.542
{\an8}FOR YOU GUYS
TO FIGHT THAT MUCH.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.710
{\an8}- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- OH, MY GOSH!

07:40.793 --> 07:42.170
{\an8}YOU GUYS FIGHT EVERY SECOND!

07:42.253 --> 07:43.754
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.590
{\an8}- YOU GUYS ARE MY ROOMMATES--
- IT'S BULL[bleep], BRO.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.049
{\an8}THEN DON'T SAY,
"I GOT YOUR BACK,"

07:47.133 --> 07:48.301
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MY BACK.
- OH, MY GOD!

07:48.384 --> 07:49.886
{\an8}I DO HAVE YOUR BACK.
- YOU DON'T HAVE MY BACK.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.095
{\an8}- WHEN DID I NOT
HAVE YOUR BACK?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.388
{\an8}- YOU DIDN'T
HAVE MY BACK IN MIAMI,

07:52.471 --> 07:54.640
{\an8}'CAUSE WHAT YOU DID
IN MIAMI WAS [bleep] WRONG.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.730
{\an8}- WHEN WE WERE IN MIAMI,

08:00.813 --> 08:05.234
{\an8}SAM HAD ASKED ME,
YOU KNOW, ABOUT THE NOTE.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.028
{\an8}THAT SAID RONNIE
WAS, LIKE, CHEATING ON HER.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.155
{\an8}- IF YOU SAW IT,
YOU SHOULD TELL ME.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.364
{\an8}- WHAT DID THE NOTE SAY?

08:10.448 --> 08:12.700
{\an8}- IT DID--HE DID.
- OKAY.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.453
{\an8}WELL,
WHATEVER THE NOTE SAID.

08:15.536 --> 08:16.871
{\an8}I DIDN'T WRITE THE NOTE,

08:16.954 --> 08:18.915
{\an8}BUT THE GIRL'S HYSTERICALLY
CRYING IN FRONT OF ME,

08:18.998 --> 08:20.416
{\an8}I WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP
THE POOR GIRL OUT.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.126
{\an8}AND I SAID,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.711
{\an8}WHATEVER'S IN
THAT NOTE IS TRUE."

08:23.794 --> 08:25.254
{\an8}THE GIRL WAS CRYING!

08:25.338 --> 08:26.756
{\an8}- DON'T TELL ME BOY CODE.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.007
{\an8}- DUDE, YOUR GIRL WAS CRYING!

08:28.090 --> 08:29.091
{\an8}- THAT'S BETWEEN US.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.844
{\an8}YOU [bleep] INVOLVED YOURSELF
IN OUR BUSINESS.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.761
{\an8}LIKE YOU ALWAYS
TELL SOMEONE ELSE

08:32.845 --> 08:34.764
{\an8}TO MIND THEIR [bleep]
BUSINESS.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.349
{\an8}- DUDE, I'M--
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

08:36.432 --> 08:38.226
{\an8}I CAME TO THIS HOUSE
THINKING YOU'RE MY BOY...

08:38.308 --> 08:39.519
{\an8}- I AM!
- ADMITTING TO HER, THE NOTE,

08:39.602 --> 08:41.520
{\an8}THAT IT'S TRUE
IS NOT HAVING MY BACK.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.730
{\an8}- I WAS NEUTRAL.
NEUTRAL!

08:42.813 --> 08:44.607
{\an8}- GIRL CODE, BRO.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE GUY CODE.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.485
{\an8}- THIS IS [bleep]!
- STABBED ME IN THE BACK, BRO.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.946
{\an8}- NEVER STABBED YOU IN THE BACK.
- NOW I CAN [bleep] SEE IT.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.697
{\an8}- RON IS JUST
VERY HEATED RIGHT NOW.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.157
{\an8}AND I KNEW
AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME,

08:53.241 --> 08:55.826
{\an8}ONE OF US SAYS SOMETHING WRONG,
IT COULD BE A FIGHT.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.620
{\an8}SO I DECIDED TO MAN-UP,
AND TAKE THE HIGH ROAD,

08:57.703 --> 08:58.621
{\an8}AND APOLOGIZE,
JUST SO THAT HE'D BE QUIET.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.790
{\an8}- YOU DON'T [bleep]
DO THAT TO ME.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.959
{\an8}- I'LL BE HONEST
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW,

09:03.042 --> 09:04.669
{\an8}I'M GONNA SAY I'M WRONG.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.879
{\an8}I'M BEING HONEST,
I PLAYED IT WRONG.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.130
{\an8}I APOLOGIZE.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.132
{\an8}OKAY?
I APOLOGIZE.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.300
{\an8}DO YOU TAKE MY APOLOGY?
- I DO.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.635
{\an8}- I PLAYED IT WRONG.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.928
{\an8}- DEFINITELY SURPRISED.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.263
{\an8}MIKE AND RONNIE ARE
HUGGING IT OUT

09:15.346 --> 09:17.098
{\an8}AFTER THIS BIG, HEATED
ARGUMENT THEY JUST HAD?

09:17.181 --> 09:18.891
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE MIKE
GAVE HIM SOME, LIKE,

09:18.975 --> 09:20.559
{\an8}VOODOO TRICK
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

09:20.643 --> 09:22.520
{\an8}TO AVOID GETTING
HIS ASS KICKED BY RONNIE.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.146
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I THINK MIKE WAS

09:24.230 --> 09:26.023
{\an8}JUST APOLOGIZING
JUST TO SHUT RONNIE UP.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.984
{\an8}AND IT WORKED.
- I APOLOGIZE.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.860
{\an8}I MEAN, I'LL BUY YOU
A COTTON CANDY OR SOMETHING

09:29.944 --> 09:31.612
{\an8}IN A LITTLE BIT, OR--
- DON'T BE FUNNY, MIKE,

09:31.696 --> 09:33.030
{\an8}DON'T BE FUNNY.
THIS IS SERIOUS.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.448
{\an8}- WE'RE BOYS,
DON'T SAY WE'RE NOT.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.034
{\an8}- I HOPE SO, BRO, I HOPE SO.
- WE ARE.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.998
{\an8}- IS THIS
BOARDWALK DINNER CUTE?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.040
{\an8}- YEAH.
YOU GOING ON A DATE?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.042
{\an8}- YEAH, IS IT ALL RIGHT
IF I GET THE SMUSH ROOM?

09:45.126 --> 09:47.044
{\an8}ROGER'S
LEAVING FOR TEN DAYS,

09:47.128 --> 09:48.921
{\an8}SO I'M REALLY HOPING
TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT

09:49.005 --> 09:50.339
{\an8}WITH HIM BEFORE HE LEAVES.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.340
{\an8}- YO.
- HI!

09:51.424 --> 09:53.718
{\an8}- YOU LOOK AMAZING.
- ROGER!

09:53.801 --> 09:54.760
{\an8}all: HI!

09:54.844 --> 09:57.346
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP, BABY?
- HI, BROTHER.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.181
{\an8}- WHAT'S IN THAT BAG?
- OH, I LOVE ROGER.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.516
{\an8}- IT'S A WHOLE
BAG FULL OF CONDOMS.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.601
{\an8}- REALLY?
- [laughing]

10:02.685 --> 10:04.854
{\an8}- BYE, GUYS.
- WHERE YOU GOING TO EAT?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.397
{\an8}- THE MEXICAN PLACE.
- OH, MY GOD,

10:06.480 --> 10:08.524
{\an8}HE'S GONNA BE
FARTING AND SNORING TONIGHT.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.234
{\an8}- YES.
- EW!

10:10.318 --> 10:11.986
{\an8}- WITHOUT A DOUBT.
- DON'T EAT THE BEANS.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.863
{\an8}- BYE.
- WE'LL TRY THE MEXICAN PLACE.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.114
{\an8}- YEAH, WHATEVER
YOU WANNA DO.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.240
{\an8}- I ACTUALLY THINK
IT'S RIGHT UP HERE.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.825
{\an8}- WHAT'S THE NAME OF
THIS PLACE AGAIN?

10:17.908 --> 10:19.327
{\an8}- SPICY MEXICAN.
- YEAH, THIS IS WHERE

10:19.410 --> 10:20.703
{\an8}MY BUDDY JOEL WORKS.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.371
{\an8}HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M JIMMY, I'M THE CHEF.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.750
{\an8}- JIMMY.
- NICE TO MEET YOU, PLEASURE.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.668
{\an8}- CHEERS, BABY.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.211
{\an8}- ROGER!

10:29.295 --> 10:30.671
{\an8}- OH, THERE'S MY BUDDY.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.382
{\an8}- THANKS FOR COMING BY, MAN.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.551
{\an8}- THIS IS JOEL.
THIS IS MY BUDDY.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.053
{\an8}- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.679
{\an8}- I'VE KNOWN JOEL
FOR YEARS.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.889
{\an8}GOOD GUY.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.932
{\an8}YO, WHAT'S UP, KID?
- HOW YOU BEEN?

10:42.016 --> 10:43.184
{\an8}- GOOD.
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.352
{\an8}- NOT MUCH, YOU KNOW.
WHAT'S UP?

10:44.435 --> 10:45.353
{\an8}- SAME OL', SAME OL'?

10:45.436 --> 10:46.771
{\an8}- AT THIS POINT,
I WOULD LIKE

10:46.854 --> 10:48.522
{\an8}ALONE TIME WITH ROGER.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.358
{\an8}BUT HE'S A LOCAL,
AND HE KNOWS EVERYONE HERE.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.234
{\an8}HIS FRIENDS
INTERRUPT CONSTANTLY.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.569
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, MAN.

10:53.652 --> 10:54.987
{\an8}- LATER, BROTHER.
- HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.489
{\an8}- I CAN'T WHEN 1,000 PEOPLE
ARE INTERRUPTING.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.783
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP?
- NOTHING.

10:58.866 --> 10:59.950
{\an8}- ROGER!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:00.034 --> 11:01.660
{\an8}- [chuckles]
- UGH.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.453
{\an8}SHOULD WE HAVE NOT
HAVE COME HERE?

11:02.536 --> 11:03.621
{\an8}- THAT'S MY BUDDY, TOMMY.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.748
{\an8}THAT I'M GOING TO WATCH
THE FIGHT WITH.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.458
{\an8}- HOW YOU DOING, MAN?
- WHAT'S UP, PLAYBOY,

11:07.541 --> 11:08.793
{\an8}HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD, MAN.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.127
{\an8}- IT'S GONNA
BE AN AGGRAVATION

11:10.211 --> 11:11.670
{\an8}IF I CONTINUE
SEEING THIS KID.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.005
{\an8}WANNA TAKE
OUR DRINKS OUTSIDE?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.215
{\an8}- YEAH.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.424
{\an8}- WHAT UP, ROGER?
- OH, MY GOD.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.552
{\an8}I GOTTA TAKE YOU
OUT OF SEASIDE.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.934
{\an8}- LISTEN, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.394
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT?

11:26.477 --> 11:27.686
{\an8}- BEING IN THIS HOUSE AND
LIVING WITH EVERYBODY AGAIN

11:27.770 --> 11:30.940
{\an8}IS MAKING ME REALIZE
HOW HARD IT IS

11:31.023 --> 11:32.441
{\an8}TO STILL GET OVER MIAMI.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.112
{\an8}HOW COULD YOU SIT THERE
AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE,

11:36.195 --> 11:38.781
{\an8}WATCH ME CRY,
AND LIE TO MY FACE?

11:38.864 --> 11:41.659
{\an8}- WHICH TIME?
WHICH TIME, SAM?

11:41.742 --> 11:45.079
{\an8}- I HAVE NEVER BEEN
SO HURT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

11:45.162 --> 11:48.374
{\an8}- I HAVE ENOUGH RESPECT AND LOVE
FOR YOU TO [bleep] ADMIT WHAT

11:48.457 --> 11:50.626
{\an8}I DID WAS [bleep] WRONG,
AND SHAMEFUL, AND DISRESPECTFUL.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.671
{\an8}YOU'RE SO [bleep]
DUMB AND HARDHEADED

11:53.754 --> 11:54.964
{\an8}THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN ADMIT

11:55.047 --> 11:56.966
{\an8}WHAT YOU DID TO ME
IN ATLANTIC CITY WAS WRONG,

11:57.049 --> 11:58.717
{\an8}WHAT YOU DID TO ME IN
JERSEY WAS WRONG.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.220
{\an8}BE A WOMAN AND MAN-UP
FOR YOUR [bleep] FOR ONCE.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.347
{\an8}I HAD A REASON
TO [bleep] ON YOU IN MIAMI.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.392
{\an8}REALIZE THAT.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.478
{\an8}- MAYBE I WAS WRONG
FOR GIVING MY NUMBER OUT

12:09.562 --> 12:10.646
{\an8}AND IGNORING
YOUR PHONE CALLS,

12:10.729 --> 12:13.649
{\an8}BUT I NEVER
MADE OUT WITH ANYBODY.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.609
{\an8}YOU EMBARRASSED ME.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.987
{\an8}YOU DON'T DESERVE
SOMEBODY LIKE ME.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.990
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T DO THIS.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.116
{\an8}THIS IS THE--WHAT?

12:22.199 --> 12:23.159
{\an8}SEVENTH DAY
WE'VE FOUGHT IN A ROW?

12:23.242 --> 12:26.620
{\an8}HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOU,
I'LL DO ME?

12:26.704 --> 12:28.998
{\an8}YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.
YOU RUINED YOUR TIME IN MIAMI,

12:29.081 --> 12:30.541
{\an8}DON'T RUIN YOUR TIME HERE.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.293
{\an8}SO YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS CONVERSATION'S OVER,

12:32.376 --> 12:34.336
{\an8}WE'RE DONE--
- CAN I JUST [bleep] EXPLAIN--

12:34.420 --> 12:38.174
{\an8}- NO, I'M DONE WITH
THIS CONVERSATION, IT'S OVER.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.009
{\an8}IT'S TIME
TO PUT MY FOOT DOWN.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.178
{\an8}I [bleep] UP
SIX MONTHS AGO.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.431
{\an8}I'VE BEEN PAYING FOR IT
FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS,

12:45.514 --> 12:47.641
{\an8}AND I'M DONE PAYING FOR IT.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.645
{\an8}- NOBODY TOOK THE SMUSH ROOM.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.689
{\an8}I WANTED
TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING

12:53.772 --> 12:55.357
{\an8}TO THINK ABOUT
BEFORE HE LEAVES.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.818
{\an8}- GET THE [bleep] OUT.

12:57.902 --> 12:58.736
{\an8}- CAN I WATCH?

12:58.819 --> 13:01.238
{\an8}- GET OUTTA MY ROOM.
- YOUR ROOM?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.908
{\an8}- I'LL MOVE IT MYSELF.
- DON'T TOUCH MY [bleep]!

13:03.991 --> 13:05.284
{\an8}- I'VE SEEN THEM
FIGHT BEFORE,

13:05.367 --> 13:06.785
{\an8}BUT THIS ONE
WAS PRETTY SERIOUS.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.413
{\an8}- STOP!
YOU PSYCHO!

13:14.251 --> 13:16.504
{\an8}- YOU DON'T DESERVE
SOMEBODY LIKE ME.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.880
{\an8}- HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOU,
I'LL DO ME?

13:17.963 --> 13:19.423
{\an8}SO YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS CONVERSATION'S OVER.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.634
{\an8}WE'RE DONE, LEAVE IT AT THAT.
- CAN I JUST [bleep]--

13:21.717 --> 13:23.969
{\an8}- NO, I'M DONE WITH
THIS CONVERSATION, IT'S OVER.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.680
{\an8}- I DON'T WANNA BE
WITH SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.058
{\an8}I HATE HIM.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.893
{\an8}- [bleep], YEAH,

13:40.152 --> 13:41.820
{\an8}YOU DON'T NEED

13:43.697 --> 13:45.991
{\an8}- YEAH.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.202

{\an8}HE WILL DO THINGS,
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S DRUNK...

13:50.788 --> 13:54.500

14:44.550 --> 14:47.469
{\an8}WE'RE BROKEN UP.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.346
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT WORTH
THESE TEARS I'M CRYING NOW.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.848
{\an8}- DON'T CRY,
I'M DONE TALKING TO YOU.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.017
{\an8}ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS ME,
LOOK AT THE WAY YOU HURT ME.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.184

[bleep] YOU, I'M OVER IT!

15:01.734 --> 15:02.735
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.320
{\an8}- SHOULD I GO HELP HIM?
- NO.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.196
{\an8}- [chuckles]
THERE'S NO HELPING THAT.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.073
{\an8}WE REALIZE THAT
THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THESE TWO.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.783
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA GET BETTER,

15:09.867 --> 15:11.327
{\an8}BUT THEN YOU REALIZE
THAT THEY JUST

15:11.410 --> 15:12.494
{\an8}LOVE TO FIGHT WITH
EACH OTHER.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.579
{\an8}SO...LET THEM GO.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.497
{\an8}- I CAN'T DO THIS

{\an8}- PLEASE!

15:27.926 --> 15:29.428
{\an8}WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO--
- TWO MORE!

15:29.511 --> 15:31.764
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE

15:37.269 --> 15:38.479
{\an8}I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
WITH ALL THIS FIGHTING.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.315
{\an8}LIKE, THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT [bleep] RELATIONSHIPS,

15:41.398 --> 15:42.358
{\an8}MY SNEAKERS ARE DIRTY.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.193
{\an8}- I GOT THE SMUSH ROOM
TONIGHT,

15:44.276 --> 15:45.653
{\an8}JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS.

15:45.736 --> 15:46.528
{\an8}I GOT THE SMUSH ROOM TONIGHT.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.529
{\an8}- YEP.

BE WITH SOMEBODY LIKE ME.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.544
{\an8}GO ENJOY YOUR [bleep] LIFE.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.004
{\an8}- IS SHE COMING, OR...?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.130
{\an8}I'M OVER IT.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.571
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT WELCOME

16:29.655 --> 16:30.906
{\an8}NOBODY LIKES YOU
IN THIS [bleep] ROOM.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.282
{\an8}- CAN YOU NOT...?
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

16:32.366 --> 16:33.742
{\an8}IT'S LIKE TO DO

16:33.826 --> 16:35.494
{\an8}- DON'T TOUCH MY [bleep]!

16:35.577 --> 16:37.496
{\an8}DON'T EVER [bleep]
TOUCH MY [bleep].

16:37.579 --> 16:38.914
{\an8}- I'VE SEEN THEM,
OBVIOUSLY, FIGHT BEFORE,

16:38.997 --> 16:40.999
{\an8}BUT THIS ONE
WAS PRETTY SERIOUS.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.168

16:49.383 --> 16:50.426
{\an8}- NOBODY WANTS YOU UP HERE!

16:50.509 --> 16:51.885
{\an8}- I WANT NOTHING TO DO

16:51.969 --> 16:53.429
{\an8}- I'LL MOVE IT MYSELF.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.264
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT ME TO [bleep]
TOUCH YOUR [bleep]?

16:55.347 --> 16:57.307
{\an8}- GO AHEAD, I'LL PUT YOU

17:06.066 --> 17:08.569
{\an8}- GET OUTTA THIS ROOM.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.489
{\an8}- ENOUGH'S ENOUGH
ALREADY.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.117
{\an8}- WE RUN UPSTAIRS...

17:15.200 --> 17:17.286
{\an8}SAMMI'S [bleep] LIKE

17:45.731 --> 17:47.316
{\an8}- I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
- TAKE A BREAK.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.485

{\an8}- I'M BRINGING
TWO HOOD GIRLS HOME TONIGHT.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.838
{\an8}- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

18:09.922 --> 18:11.715
{\an8}I HOPE TO SEE
SINGLE RONNIE VERY SHORTLY.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.842
{\an8}- IF HE WANTS TO PLAY
THAT DIRTY GAME WITH YOU,

18:13.926 --> 18:15.552
{\an8}WE CAN PLAY IT
TEN TIMES AS HARD.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.179
{\an8}- I'M JUST GONNA
GO OUT AND BE A SLUT.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.818
{\an8}CAUSE I NEVER LIKED YOU.
- NEVER EVER...!

18:30.901 --> 18:32.528
{\an8}- THAT'S WHY I CHEATED ON YOU
IN MIAMI!

18:32.611 --> 18:33.445
{\an8}- YOU DON'T DESERVE IT!

18:33.529 --> 18:35.072
{\an8}- I GOT GIRLS
COOKING ME DINNER.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.406
{\an8}I'VE BEEN WITH YOU
FOR A YEAR,

18:36.490 --> 18:37.699
{\an8}HOW MANY TIMES

18:37.783 --> 18:39.368
{\an8}NONE, YOU [bleep]
USELESS SPOILED BITCH!

18:41.370 --> 18:43.705
{\an8}[overlapping yelling]

18:43.789 --> 18:45.124
{\an8}- THIS FIGHT WAS PROBABLY
THE WORST FIGHT I'VE EVER SEEN.

18:45.207 --> 18:49.044
{\an8}I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
A FIVE-CAR CRASH.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.547
{\an8}IT WAS HORRIBLE, BUT YOU
CAN'T KEEP YOUR EYES OFF IT.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.091
{\an8}- YOU DON'T--
- SAM, IT'S OVER, STOP!

18:54.174 --> 18:57.135
{\an8}- LET GO OF ME,
LET GO OF ME!

18:57.219 --> 18:59.763
{\an8}NEVER COME
TO MY FACE EVER AGAIN!

18:59.847 --> 19:01.515
{\an8}- GOOD, GET THE [bleep]
OUTTA MY FACE.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.725
{\an8}- [crying]

19:03.809 --> 19:06.186
{\an8}- BREATHE, BRO.

{\an8}COME ON, LET'S JUST GET OUT.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.900

{\an8}JUST FIGHTING
AND THAT'S IT; IT'S OVER.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.611
{\an8}- COME ON, PAL.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.904
{\an8}- I DON'T WANNA BE
HERE ANYMORE.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.614
{\an8}- WHAT IF YOU JUST
MOVE YOUR BED DOWNSTAIRS?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.658
{\an8}- NO, I DON'T WANNA LIVE
WITH SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.119
{\an8}HE'S A CRAZY PSYCHO.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:22.202 --> 19:24.329
{\an8}[bleep] THIS BITCH.
PUT YOUR [bleep] HANDS ON ME?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.581
{\an8}I TOLD YOU IF YOU EVER

19:27.499 --> 19:29.251
{\an8}IF YOU EVER [bleep] PUT

19:29.334 --> 19:30.627
{\an8}I'LL [bleep]--

19:30.711 --> 19:33.088
{\an8}- I TOLD YOU IF YOU EVER
PUT YOUR [bleep] HANDS ON ME,

19:33.172 --> 19:34.798
{\an8}[bleep] GO
ON THE [bleep] PORCH.

19:34.882 --> 19:35.632
{\an8}- YO, MY MAN
HAS JUST LOST IT.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.092
{\an8}PART OF ME WAS LIKE,

19:37.175 --> 19:39.052
{\an8}AW, MAN, COME ON, MAN.
GIVE IT A BREAK.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.638
{\an8}BUT...THE OTHER
PART OF ME WAS LIKE,

19:41.722 --> 19:43.765
{\an8}JUST LET HIM GO.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.684
{\an8}- SHE CAN [bleep]
SLEEP ON THE PORCH.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.060
