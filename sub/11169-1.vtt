03:37.951 --> 03:41.011
I'm Kuttan.
AIso known as Krishnan P.P.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.747
Mr. Krishnan P.P,
your father is a farmer.

03:44.190 --> 03:47.250
But you opted for the
software industry. Why?

03:48.127 --> 03:52.086
That is because, after a great
consideration and consuItation...

03:52.265 --> 03:54.790
...I came to the concIusion
that this sociaIist iIIusion was...

03:54.968 --> 03:56.765
...a great botheration
to the Indian nation...

03:56.936 --> 03:58.927
...whose basic occupation
was cuItivation and irrigation.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.274
But with further contempIation
and deIiberation...

04:02.609 --> 04:04.099
...I discovered that
without gIobaIization and..

04:04.310 --> 04:06.938
...expIoration there can not
be optimization to make India's...

04:07.113 --> 04:08.910
...transformation
to a super power nation.

04:11.718 --> 04:12.912
So...

04:15.855 --> 04:19.017
How about BangaIore for
yourfirst posting Mr. Krishnan P.P?

04:19.892 --> 04:23.328
On asking Iike that.
Which MaIayaIi can say, no, to that?

04:25.365 --> 04:28.630
WhiIe in KeraIa, we're
desperate to Ieave...

04:29.002 --> 04:31.800
When outside, we're desperate
to get back, to native pIace.

04:32.205 --> 04:36.699
As soon as weekend, comes I board
the first bus to go home to KeraIa.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.771
Whatever any one says.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.942
Water, soiI and women...
...are the best in our pIace.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.078
Father!

04:48.221 --> 04:49.779
I'm here, man.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.159
How was yourjourney?

04:55.328 --> 04:55.885
It was fine, father.

04:56.195 --> 04:56.752
Brother Narayanan!

04:56.863 --> 04:57.659
HeIIo!

04:57.930 --> 05:00.296
My son, how is my cuItivation?

05:04.871 --> 05:05.667
Hey feIIow!

05:05.972 --> 05:08.668
Every week you bring
the soiIed cIoths from Mysore.

05:08.775 --> 05:09.799
You, yourseIf does
the washing by battering.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.901
Then why can't you do
this there itseIf?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.603
What are you saying, mom?

05:13.746 --> 05:15.213
The water out there, is
it Iike our water in here?

05:15.882 --> 05:18.146
Mysore isn't our pIace,
our pIace is KeraIa.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.909
(singing a popuIar MaIayaIam song)

05:21.054 --> 05:22.578
See the acts of this boy!

05:27.260 --> 05:29.125
''Hi, tie, candy. - Hi, tie, candy.''

05:31.264 --> 05:33.129
Liked on eating.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.393
Liked on eating.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.862
After eating it, it wiII
turn out to a dismay.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.198
After eating it, it wiII
turn out to a dismay.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.173
Do you know who wrote this poem?

05:42.275 --> 05:43.708
Kunjunni master.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.878
Yes, it is a poem
by Kunjunni master.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.276
Let us read another one.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.347
Kutta, the bus wiII arrive now.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.678
Did you pack everything?
Don't forget anything.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.687
If you sit with poetry Iike your
father, you won't reach anywhere.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.687
This is our Kunju.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.023
My father's sister's daughter.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.165
Hi! I'm Divya Prakash.
FinaI year B.com.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.400
Divya Prakash,
what is your ambition?

06:09.802 --> 06:13.067
I want to do MBA from IIM
and start an independent company.

06:13.339 --> 06:14.738
Who is your inspiration, Divya?

06:14.974 --> 06:15.736
My parents.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.073
They give their fuII
support to aII my dreams.

06:18.745 --> 06:21.077
What kind of change can
you bring in this worId, Divya?

06:21.247 --> 06:23.772
If you take the totaI
working Iabor in this worId.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.376
It's women who do 67% of work.

06:26.986 --> 06:28.886
But if you caIcuIate the
totaI assets, in the worId.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.983
Women don't have even 1 % of it.

06:31.791 --> 06:32.382
That must change.

06:32.825 --> 06:36.283
When I start my own company.
WiII give more jobs to women.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.927
This is the condition of, most of the
girIs educated from GuIf countries.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.732
By mixing up EngIish
and MaIayaIam.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.963
By rendering 2 Iong sentences.

06:46.205 --> 06:47.934
They think they have
conquered this worId.

06:49.108 --> 06:53.067
Don't hear aII this boosting.
she's just an innocent, dumb girI.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.079
Mothers, smart daughter!

06:55.214 --> 06:56.146
Give the paper to there.

06:56.349 --> 06:56.940
I'II give.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.107
Here, did you see this? See this.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.714
My daughter has got first rank.

07:00.820 --> 07:01.081
Pass it on to them.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.118
Everyone is Iooking at you.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.848
UntiI, monthIy once if astroIogicaI
consuItations are not done.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.287
Aunty, won't be having
peace of mind.

07:07.493 --> 07:10.792
Did you see a Iame
person on your way here?

07:10.997 --> 07:13.056
Yes, was seen here.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.395
Yes. An omen.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.133
Isn't he the peon here?

07:17.270 --> 07:20.296
Whatever it may be... An
omen is definiteIy an omen.

07:20.506 --> 07:21.768
Yes. Yes.

07:21.908 --> 07:22.431
Did you understand? Hear!

07:22.775 --> 07:25.903
When my brother had
a daughter, I foresaw.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.773
UnIucky pIanets
in the seventh house...

07:27.914 --> 07:29.245
A bad omen.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.178
The very sight of unIucky pIanets.

07:32.084 --> 07:35.884
I toId him many times
not to educate her.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.491
I, aIso warned that she wiII
create iII-fame, but in vain!

07:39.892 --> 07:41.154
During degree studies.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.053
FeII in Iove with a guy.

07:43.262 --> 07:44.889
That too, one haiIing
from another reIigion.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.192
She eIoped with him.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.900
Once everything was
over, he deserted her.

07:51.103 --> 07:54.334
I asked him then, didn't I warn you?

07:55.942 --> 07:59.343
Your daughter aIso, has the
same kind of horoscope.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.541
Aunt wiII onIy Iisten
to the astroIoger.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.442
UncIe wiII Iisten onIy to aunt.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.375
Is there, any need to say more?

08:07.553 --> 08:10.147
Isn't there a remedy to this?

08:10.289 --> 08:12.086
Can find a remedy and aII.

08:14.393 --> 08:15.382
But...

08:15.928 --> 08:17.259
Within two months.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.929
This girI's marriage
shouId be conducted.

08:20.166 --> 08:20.860
Oh! My heavens.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.364
Otherwise...

08:25.838 --> 08:27.499
As someone said in some movie...

08:28.274 --> 08:32.870
...this is fate, my dear.
No one can stop that.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.414
In one Iook of the unIucky
pIanets, MBA dreams vanished.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.945
In its pIace arrived
an MBA guy...

08:41.087 --> 08:44.545
28 years oId.
Good Iooks. Good habits. Das.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.218
Have one nibbIe...

08:47.260 --> 08:48.887
It was made by Divya.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.903
Have tea.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.972
Divya, sit there, dear. Go, dear.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.166
When did you return from the USA?

09:03.309 --> 09:04.173
Last week.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.208
Okay then.

09:05.378 --> 09:05.901
Where are you based in the USA?

09:06.045 --> 09:06.602
Los AngeIes.

09:06.946 --> 09:07.571
My sister's daughter is there.

09:07.947 --> 09:08.345
Is it?

09:08.514 --> 09:09.242
Where are they, over there?

09:09.448 --> 09:12.246
In US, 'OkIahoma'.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.214
OkIahoma. Do you
visit, those pIaces?

09:15.187 --> 09:15.414
No...

09:15.621 --> 09:17.555
No. They don't go there.
We have been there.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.585
Yes, we have many photos of that.

09:19.959 --> 09:20.857
Come, wiII show you.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.051
Let us see the photos.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.252
- Let them taIk to each other.

09:23.930 --> 09:24.589
ChiIdren, come aIong.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.831
Son, she has appeared
for MBA entrance exam.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.927
Which University
have you appIied to?

09:31.270 --> 09:33.067
I have been enIisted at IIM.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.604
Waiting for the interview caII.

09:34.941 --> 09:35.839
Nice.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.070
Divya?

09:42.448 --> 09:43.574
Divya...

09:46.686 --> 09:48.950
I, was having a serious
reIationship with a girI.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.150
Even though it is in past...

09:58.030 --> 09:59.554
I don't think I'm over it.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.095
I reaIIy don't know
if I'm ready for this.

10:04.170 --> 10:09.267
When my parents and
others compeIIed me...

10:10.409 --> 10:12.309
It is nothing personaI.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.612
I feIt, Divya, shouId know aII this.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.992
Divya, do you have anything to say?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.628
That is...
I didn't make that nibbIe.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.006
So then I don't have
to struggIe with it?

10:50.349 --> 10:52.249
Mother's nibbIes are eaten by him.

10:59.258 --> 11:02.250
Like that.
Kunju's fate was aIso decided.

11:12.271 --> 11:15.172
WhiIe others decided, both
of our destinies...

11:15.574 --> 11:18.065
There is a 3rd person
who doesn't faII in none of this.

11:18.377 --> 11:20.345
The so caIIed Arjun, who is Aju.

11:50.309 --> 11:51.367
Make it fast, fast.

11:59.085 --> 12:02.077
Hey, what are you
doing there on top?

12:02.455 --> 12:03.581
Run...run away.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.558
Run...run away.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.821
The one who has escaped
from the cIutches of expectations.

12:39.158 --> 12:40.318
Long ago.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.359
When we mugged up answers,
he found questions.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.464
When we tightIy heId
onto seats that we obtained.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.328
He disdained the one and escaped.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.837
In various cities, did
different kinds ofjob.

12:56.308 --> 12:59.175
In short, a new generation gypsy.

13:00.379 --> 13:03.507
His normaI practice is
running away under cover.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.852
Hi! - Aju, what are you doing? Man.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.521
Nothing as usuaI.

13:14.393 --> 13:16.088
Isn't it time to hug your
teddy bear and sIeep?

13:16.295 --> 13:17.159
Can't beIieve is it not?
Everything happened suddenIy.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.464
Get Iost. I have some news.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.156
What is it?

13:22.468 --> 13:23.628
My marriage has been fixed.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.827
What?

13:25.271 --> 13:26.761
The 18th of this month.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.673
Within two weeks time.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.138
Is he known to you?

13:30.376 --> 13:32.674
Yes. I met him today.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.107
Today?

13:34.446 --> 13:36.107
Arranged marriage?

13:36.382 --> 13:37.872
Were you forced from the house?

13:38.217 --> 13:40.151
Nothing Iike that.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.445
He is a nice guy.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.553
Good feIIow.

13:43.722 --> 13:44.552
Kunju!

13:44.790 --> 13:46.348
I know it is a surprise.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.651
But it's aII fine.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.658
Do you know what the best part is?

13:49.795 --> 13:52.127
After marriage,
straight to BangaIore.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.129
Do you remember, in the
past aII three of us had pIanned.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.426
To have a rocking
time in BangaIore?

13:55.634 --> 13:57.261
A bus ticket wiII
take you to BangaIore.

13:57.436 --> 13:58.869
No need to marry forthat!

14:00.573 --> 14:02.234
Get here by the 17th.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.135
Ceremonies are at
our ancestraI house.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.800
Wedding is in Swati HaII.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.841
Whatever it is, it is betterto marry
of girIs who are in this generation.

14:09.148 --> 14:10.615
What about your MBA pIans?

14:10.783 --> 14:11.579
Left everything, is it not?

14:11.750 --> 14:12.239
Idiot!

14:12.451 --> 14:14.851
HeIIo! Are you the one saying
who haven't passed even 12th?

14:15.154 --> 14:16.781
Gopichetta!
Divya's marriage has been fixed.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.548
Is the CoIoneI coming?

14:19.258 --> 14:21.226
When has your father attended
anything in this famiIy?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.349
When wiII you be coming?
TeII me that.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.893
I am not coming for any wedding.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.561
Aju, you haven't come
native, since schooI days.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.130
If you don't attend my wedding,
I'II never taIk to you again.

14:29.301 --> 14:30.893
Is it a promise?

14:32.371 --> 14:33.338
Idiot!

14:39.778 --> 14:41.370
It was Iike that, right
from the oIden times.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.873
Divya, Aju and me.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.944
Many of the dreams
and memories of chiIdhood.

14:47.319 --> 14:48.877
We, 3 used to share.

14:49.822 --> 14:50.789
As the schooI vacation arrives.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.881
They both wiII Iand up with
me at the ancestraI house.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.553
Then for two months we
used to have a joIIy time.

14:57.196 --> 15:01.758
With cars, bike and cycIe,
a worId of our own.

15:02.801 --> 15:07.363
Then, jumping in the pond, pIay
cricket, secretIy smoke cigarettes.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.234
To get the caning for that.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.171
For everything, we were together.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.339
But once schooI days were over.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.611
3 got departed to 3 different routes.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.949
During those times, one among
the dreams that we saw was.

15:20.319 --> 15:21.445
BangaIore.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.661
''A cage for the green bird''

17:45.964 --> 17:47.727
''A cage with vegetabIe
window siIIs''

17:47.900 --> 17:49.527
''A cage for the green bird''

17:49.701 --> 17:51.760

21:50.742 --> 21:52.175
On saying we can't

21:52.411 --> 21:54.276
Seeing him now, can say, he is the
boy who ran away from schooI before.

21:54.713 --> 21:55.179
Isn't it, Brother Kuttan?

21:55.414 --> 21:57.814
I wish, I had aIso run away

Then why are you doing this job?

22:11.863 --> 22:13.262
That is because.

22:13.799 --> 22:14.891
On fearing aunty.

22:15.067 --> 22:18.127
In brother Kuttan's Iife father, mother
everyone has got a say in it.

22:18.303 --> 22:19.201
Except for brother Kuttan.

22:19.371 --> 22:20.861

22:21.406 --> 22:22.338
No, man.

22:23.241 --> 22:24.299

22:36.388 --> 22:38.253

Dropped the racing.

22:50.936 --> 22:51.425
Why is that?

22:51.770 --> 22:52.236
I thought..

22:52.404 --> 22:54.269
I, just can't foIIow their
ruIes and reguIations.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.236
Aju. Aren't you continuing
the education?

22:56.441 --> 22:58.068
Everyone in here was asking that.

22:58.410 --> 23:01.709
The KeraIa, has got the highest
rate of suicides and heart attacks.

23:02.147 --> 23:03.171
Why is that?

23:04.249 --> 23:06.376
The reason for heart attack,
is it not coconut oiI?

23:06.918 --> 23:08.010
No, you feIIow!

23:10.155 --> 23:10.917
Expectations.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.919
FamiIy members and compatriots.

23:13.291 --> 23:16.419
You are aII Iiving inside the pressure
cooker, of others expectations.

23:16.762 --> 23:19.230
When the pressure increases,
the whistIe wiII be bIown.

23:21.266 --> 23:22.927
The Iife gone!

23:25.437 --> 23:27.268
What is the connection
between that and education?

23:27.406 --> 23:28.703
In the very same KeraIa.

23:28.874 --> 23:30.774
Has got the highest Iiteracy IeveI.

23:30.909 --> 23:31.933
Now, is there connection?

23:35.814 --> 23:36.746
Afterthe schooIing.

23:36.882 --> 23:37.780
Aren't you writing entrance?

23:37.949 --> 23:38.779
On compIeting degree.

23:38.950 --> 23:39.780
Job, not yet obtained?

23:39.951 --> 23:40.440
On getting the job.

23:40.752 --> 23:41.719
What is the saIary?

23:41.887 --> 23:42.945
On getting good saIary.

23:43.121 --> 23:43.951
When is the marriage?

23:44.156 --> 23:45.020
After the marriage.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.179
Not yet having the chiIdren?

23:46.425 --> 23:47.357
If the baby is not conceived.

23:47.726 --> 23:48.920
Do you want the
number of the doctor?

23:49.161 --> 23:50.128
On conceiving the chiId.

23:50.328 --> 23:51.124
The same oId questions.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.864
For the time being, no one has
got high expectations on me.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.400
Let it remain Iike that onIy.

23:58.069 --> 23:58.967
Forget of my case.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.295
How are your things going?

24:00.939 --> 24:02.133
Is the training at Mysore over?

24:02.841 --> 24:04.001
Got ready to go to BangaIore?

24:05.143 --> 24:07.907
TruIy speaking, I'm not interested
to Ieave this pIace and go.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.876
On going to this
BangaIore and Mysore.

24:11.049 --> 24:13.017
It is Iike trapped in some pIace.

24:13.485 --> 24:17.182
If it is here means, we can bath
in our pond, can go to tempIe.

24:17.422 --> 24:19.287
Can have the Matta,
rice grown in PaIaghat.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.358
Are you going there, to
have Matta rice of PaIaghat?

24:21.526 --> 24:22.720
That's not the thing.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.828
Somehow I didn't Iike that much.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.158
Sometimes, I, used to go.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.496
There is a big market
of automobiIe parts.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.332
But, whatever city, it may be.

24:34.873 --> 24:35.737
Company, shouId be there.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.502

24:41.313 --> 24:42.371
Then I'm aIso joining.

24:42.514 --> 24:45.176
No need, you get married and

24:45.350 --> 24:45.782

24:45.917 --> 24:46.440
Yes.

24:50.388 --> 24:51.320
Hey girI!

25:57.422 --> 25:58.616

26:00.292 --> 26:01.190
...of Thrissur Pooram festivaI.

26:02.627 --> 26:03.958
EIephant?

26:04.262 --> 26:04.591
No, baby eIephant.

26:04.963 --> 26:07.227
Divya, can't you remain quiet
at Ieast on your wedding day, chiId?

26:08.133 --> 26:10.363
Shobha! The groom's
party has reached.

26:10.502 --> 26:11.264
You go there fast.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.001

26:19.911 --> 26:21.208

26:26.284 --> 26:27.581
Let me just peek

26:27.953 --> 26:28.885
Okay sure.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.256
Does the bride want
to see the groom?

26:32.991 --> 26:34.288
What I stiII don't understand is...

26:34.559 --> 26:36.459
...why is there such a
hurry to see the groom?

26:37.128 --> 26:38.595
He won't Ieave before

26:39.965 --> 26:42.126
Then, afterthe wedding

26:42.334 --> 26:43.323
Divya Prakash to...

26:43.501 --> 26:44.263
Divya Das.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.164
Why is that?

26:45.337 --> 26:46.463
Is it a transfer of ownership?

26:46.605 --> 26:47.299
To change the name.

26:47.472 --> 26:48.632
Everyone is changing, is it so?

26:48.974 --> 26:50.202
Men don't!

27:11.329 --> 27:13.559
Oh! Brother Kuttan!

27:14.199 --> 27:15.291

Aju, be quiet.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.071

27:23.975 --> 27:26.000
If you are not wiIIing to marry,

27:26.244 --> 27:28.109
That...I...then...

27:29.547 --> 27:30.241

30:25.323 --> 30:28.781
There is no need to swim, going
no where Ieaving the shore.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.693
Then, what is the use of it?

30:31.863 --> 30:33.262
The thing is.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.292
It was the sister's idea.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.162
Sister's husband is a navy officer.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.304
Thank God! He is not in the army.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.436
SignaI is very weak.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.605
No. I just changed now.

30:55.153 --> 30:58.782
In office, I actuaIIy handIe
mergers and acquisitions.

30:59.257 --> 31:00.884
Today, there is an
important merger cIosure.

31:02.627 --> 31:04.618
I have a video conference now.

31:04.762 --> 31:06.252
It'II take some time.

31:06.431 --> 31:07.159
You can go to sIeep, Divya.

31:07.332 --> 31:08.890
Morning, have to
go to Guruvayoor, is it not?

31:09.367 --> 31:11.392
Let me check whether
there is signaI outside.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.980
That room is Iocked
up, with some oId stuff.

33:26.871 --> 33:29.362
Mother has asked Chinnamma
to come and heIp you, Divya.

33:29.507 --> 33:32.067
Once she comes, things wiII
be easier for you, Divya.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.371
It is Chinnamma who has
Iooked after me in chiIdhood.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.376
There was no miIk.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.377
It is bIack tea.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.045
I'II get it whiIe coming
back in the evening.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.319
It is enough if you introduce
me to some neighbor.

33:43.488 --> 33:44.546
I'II go and buy myseIf.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.054
I don't know anyone out here.

33:47.392 --> 33:48.484
From how Iong are you Iiving here?

33:53.564 --> 33:55.555
I was in Kochi. For MBA coaching.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.997
That time I got friendIy with
everyone in that buiIding.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.829
This is not Kochi.
This is BangaIore.

34:01.105 --> 34:02.902
Here no one has
got time for anything.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.902
I'II wash that.

34:05.076 --> 34:08.011
No need. I Iike to do
my things myseIf.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.804
Then do mine too!

34:53.157 --> 34:54.987
HaIIo! Yes mother.

34:55.493 --> 34:57.016
I'm in the Iift. I'II caII you.

34:57.662 --> 34:58.651
Are you a MaIayaIi?

34:58.830 --> 35:00.457
No, I'm not a MaIayaIi.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.795
What aII things they shouId know?
Whether a MaIayaIi or a worker.

35:10.408 --> 35:11.636
Kuttoos!

35:11.809 --> 35:12.537
Hey Aju!

35:14.979 --> 35:16.037

35:16.214 --> 35:17.613
That and aII reached.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.813
Is this my room?

35:52.183 --> 35:53.582
Greetings, Arjun brother!

35:54.051 --> 35:54.881
So you have finaIIy come

35:55.052 --> 35:56.178

35:56.954 --> 35:57.978

35:59.524 --> 36:01.014
You'II Iove it.

36:02.026 --> 36:03.960

36:04.996 --> 36:05.587
Duddu.

36:05.730 --> 36:06.094
Yes brother.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.095
This is Arjun Bhai, from now

36:08.633 --> 36:09.998
Studebaker!

36:10.168 --> 36:11.931
Yes, Studebaker.

36:24.081 --> 36:26.072
Come Arjun Bhai, this
is our own pIace.

36:26.551 --> 36:29.076
They toId they wiII
get a good guy for me.

36:29.287 --> 36:31.221
The race season is going to start.

36:34.292 --> 36:37.193
Hey, Samy Bhai! How are you?

36:38.095 --> 36:39.687
How is the practice and aII going?

36:39.830 --> 36:40.194
Yea, going on.

36:40.498 --> 36:41.055
Who is that chap?

36:41.666 --> 36:42.997
SIightIy hot tempered.

36:43.267 --> 36:45.064
But he does a very good job.

36:45.603 --> 36:46.695
Arjun Bhai.

36:47.004 --> 36:51.202
That workshop, this
cafe, motor cross track.

36:51.509 --> 36:52.737
AII beIongs to Sami Bhai.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.639
AII of them are 'Storm Riders'.

36:54.812 --> 36:57.007
Samy Bhai is the boss
of the gang cum Ieader.

36:57.281 --> 36:59.715
I'm not the boss.
That is Shiva.

36:59.884 --> 37:00.646
Shiva!

37:00.952 --> 37:04.911
Shiva was a an aII time champion.
I have never seen him.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.648
But no one has ever
beat him in racing.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.085
When can I see the bikes?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.251
It is in the track. I'II show you.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.828
Look what is the
screen pass word of this?

37:58.075 --> 37:59.906
Don't put my photos
on the face book.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.772
Oh! UncIe, that's my husband.

39:41.979 --> 39:42.707
Is he this girI's husband?

39:42.913 --> 39:44.904
PIease come, now we have got
Iot of friends over here.

39:45.082 --> 39:45.776
Can meet every one.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.756
Today whiIe I was painting,
got struck outside the baIcony.

39:55.192 --> 39:56.420
I shouted a Iot from there.

39:56.794 --> 39:57.761
No one heard.

39:57.962 --> 39:59.395
Then I had even send a rocket.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.788
That was seen by Iyyer uncIe.

40:00.965 --> 40:03.365
Iyyer uncIe, then caIIed every one
and then chiIdren dropped...

40:03.501 --> 40:04.900
...me a screw driver.

40:05.069 --> 40:05.398
Divya!

40:05.703 --> 40:06.032
Then I...

40:10.474 --> 40:13.932
Divya, this is my private
space not a pubIic park.

40:14.378 --> 40:15.276
Not that.

40:15.446 --> 40:18.244
Did I say? When I got struck, they
were the peopIe who heIped me.

40:18.382 --> 40:19.280
Let it be.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.748
Why creating this kind of situations?

40:21.919 --> 40:23.944
Then why is the house
kept aII messed up Iike this?

40:24.155 --> 40:26.350
Drawing something on the
waIIs and on the gIass?

40:26.791 --> 40:28.952
If it is painting, why not
do it on paper or canvas?

42:39.123 --> 42:39.555
Mother.

42:39.924 --> 42:41.915
It is good that you
asked me to come here.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.086
Yes.

42:46.196 --> 42:48.027
Madam, what are you saying?

42:48.165 --> 42:50.030
Everything in this house
is happening upside down.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.428
The house is compIete mess.

42:51.635 --> 42:54.433
When I came in the morning.
Won't wash the dishes, gIasses.

42:54.605 --> 42:57.506
When I came, saw baby Das
making coffee to that girI, daiIy.

42:57.641 --> 42:58.938
OnIy afterthat, he is going to office.

42:59.109 --> 43:00.235
That girI doesn't even wake up.

43:00.444 --> 43:03.242
Why did you get Das baby
married to such a girI?

43:04.949 --> 43:06.541
Madam, she has come.

43:06.951 --> 43:10.352
You phone me daiIy in the evening.
I'II be at home by then.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.522
I'II taIk freeIy. ShaII
I, hang up, madam?

43:12.890 --> 43:13.948
Give regards to aII in America.

43:30.307 --> 43:32.002
It's futiIe to do aII this forthem.

43:32.977 --> 43:35.343
No matter what training is done,
they wiII never ride properIy.

43:35.512 --> 43:36.638
Why are you so tense Sir?

43:36.981 --> 43:38.141
Because I, happen
to be their coach.

43:39.183 --> 43:40.411
Job of a coach is to teach, right?

43:40.951 --> 43:43.943
Teaching these guys about bikes...
...Is Iike preaching to cattIes.

43:44.121 --> 43:44.485
That's true.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.013
We'II do weII, coach.

43:46.223 --> 43:47.554
The trust is everything, is it not?

43:47.725 --> 43:50.193
Just because yourfather
has got money don't pIay, Sami.

43:51.328 --> 43:53.319
If it goes on Iike this. We'II
have to shut down the cIub.

43:53.998 --> 43:55.260
This is fantastic, man.

43:55.432 --> 43:56.592
The power of this wouId have
increased now, Isn't it?

43:56.734 --> 43:56.995
Yes.

44:02.172 --> 44:03.400
This styIe of sitting
has to be changed.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.006
See that dip?

44:05.142 --> 44:06.939
That's the sweet spot. Sit on it.

44:07.478 --> 44:11.414
Chin shouId aIways be on top
of the handIe bar. I'II show you.

44:12.282 --> 44:13.044
HoId it.

44:15.552 --> 44:16.484
This is the correct posture.

44:51.288 --> 44:52.585
Why are you Iooking
for another pIace to stay?

44:52.756 --> 44:54.724
If your foIks at native come to know,
that I'm with you. That's enough.

44:55.025 --> 44:57.687
To protect the software engineer,
aunty wiII come fIying.

44:58.562 --> 44:59.460
When is Kunju, coming?

45:00.564 --> 45:01.428
Oh! She must have reached.

45:01.598 --> 45:02.292
ShouId I, caII her?

45:02.433 --> 45:03.593
Isn't there any honeymoon?

45:03.767 --> 45:05.701
No, he seems to be busy.

45:06.470 --> 45:08.267
It's Iike that once
you arrive in BangaIore.

45:08.639 --> 45:10.402
This is the first time
I am Ieaving office earIy.

45:10.641 --> 45:12.108
Let this be a good beginning.

45:13.544 --> 45:14.442
How much is it?

45:14.611 --> 45:15.134
HeIIo!

45:15.279 --> 45:16.371
Arjun here. HeIIo.

45:16.513 --> 45:17.445
What's up sir?

45:18.449 --> 45:19.507
I'm on my way.

45:20.451 --> 45:23.079
Kuttan's, hop in the vehicIe.
The car has to be deIivered.

45:24.188 --> 45:25.246
WeII! Did you see this?

45:25.456 --> 45:26.081
What is it?

45:26.690 --> 45:28.021
In BangaIore you can
see many things Iike that.

45:28.192 --> 45:28.681
You get inside the car.

45:28.826 --> 45:31.454
But stiII... Are they kissing
and pIaying?

45:31.628 --> 45:32.322
Let them pIay, man.

45:32.496 --> 45:33.087
Gosh!

45:33.630 --> 45:37.191
You try to get in quick.
ShaII we go?

45:37.334 --> 45:38.358
Aren't they stopping it?

45:38.502 --> 45:39.560
Too bad!

45:42.539 --> 45:43.699
What a pity?

45:44.374 --> 45:45.432
The cuIture of KeraIa
is aIways better.

45:45.642 --> 45:46.301
Why is that?

45:46.510 --> 45:47.602
Does no one kiss in KeraIa?

45:47.811 --> 45:49.244
Anyway, not on the roadside!

45:49.646 --> 45:52.137
Aju, this is not meant for us.

45:52.816 --> 45:56.308
We have our own cuIture.
Don't we have our vaIues?

45:56.487 --> 45:59.820
This is not cuIture or history,
Kuttan. It's pure bioIogy.

46:00.491 --> 46:02.459
If it is bioIogy, it is
appIicabIe to aII is it not?

46:02.659 --> 46:04.388
Why to me and you,
it's not Iike that?

46:04.661 --> 46:07.027
We are aII, taught to waIk in
the straight path of virtue.

46:10.834 --> 46:11.698
Why are you not saying anything?

46:12.069 --> 46:14.629
Kutta...Speak of your kind of things.

46:16.106 --> 46:17.573
Aju...You!

46:18.742 --> 46:20.141
When was it? How?

46:20.310 --> 46:21.334
That is..

46:21.645 --> 46:22.304
When was that?

46:24.314 --> 46:25.645
I was not toId about that.

46:29.153 --> 46:30.211
Gosh!

46:31.555 --> 46:33.147
Hey Kutta. Your case..

46:33.323 --> 46:35.154
Aju...This is a betrayaI.

46:37.161 --> 46:37.627
What betrayaI?

46:37.861 --> 46:38.486
No need to Iaugh.

46:38.762 --> 46:39.421
Wait and see.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.188
I'II aIso not teII
you anything.

46:42.633 --> 46:43.861
Just cooI down man.

46:45.102 --> 46:46.091
Forget my matter.

46:46.336 --> 46:49.169
Kuttan, so you have never...Ever?

46:50.107 --> 46:50.664
Go man!

46:50.808 --> 46:52.332
Search some other guys forthat.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.201
You won't get this
Kuttan for aII that.

46:55.245 --> 46:57.304
It is against my cuIture.

46:57.447 --> 46:57.845
That's true.

46:58.215 --> 47:00.080
''By appIying coIIyrium
to the eyes''

47:00.250 --> 47:04.710
''On putting marks on the fore
heads. The outside state Iadies''

47:04.888 --> 47:05.650
''Came waIking''

47:05.789 --> 47:07.450
What were we taIking about?

47:07.624 --> 47:08.750
CuIture.

47:08.926 --> 47:11.292
Yes...CuIture.

47:12.262 --> 47:15.288
It is not because you
are scared of girIs. Isn't it?

47:16.300 --> 47:18.200
Why shouId I be scared?

47:19.269 --> 47:20.600
Whether the Ieaf
faIIs on the thorn...

47:20.804 --> 47:23.329
...or the thorn on the Ieaf,
It's the Ieaf that is hurt!

47:28.278 --> 47:29.609
I'II set him right.

47:29.880 --> 47:31.438
Hey! What?

47:32.449 --> 47:34.212
Is it necessary, that you have
to whistIe on seeing the girIs?

47:34.384 --> 47:36.443
I'II knock your teeth out.

47:45.162 --> 47:46.527
What did she say?

47:48.198 --> 47:50.223
She said, I Iove you brother.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.890
Go man! I know that
much Hindi and aII.

47:52.936 --> 47:53.800
No that Kuttan's.

47:54.671 --> 47:56.332
Now, are you a
Ieaf or a thorn?

47:56.473 --> 47:58.998
I'II show you man, wiII do some
tricks and won't say anything.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.418
Shit! Give me that!

48:11.722 --> 48:12.279
Kunju!

48:12.489 --> 48:12.853
Hi!

48:13.223 --> 48:14.383
What kind of an attire is this?

48:15.792 --> 48:16.588
Your mango juice.

48:16.727 --> 48:17.591
Thank you.

48:22.466 --> 48:23.956
This is Aju.

48:25.702 --> 48:26.361
Arjun.

48:26.603 --> 48:27.797
Remember seeing at the wedding.

48:28.672 --> 48:31.641
Do you remember aII those
who attended the wedding?

48:32.442 --> 48:33.431
This is Brother Kuttan.

48:36.013 --> 48:37.412
You are turning roIy-poIy, okay.

48:37.581 --> 48:38.980
That is because of
eating out. That's why.

48:39.483 --> 48:40.450
Did you cook?

48:40.617 --> 48:42.608
Yes, traditionaI, good food.

48:42.819 --> 48:45.447
That's nice. It's been Iong since
I've eaten homemade food.

48:45.656 --> 48:46.953
When did you Iearn to cook?

48:47.357 --> 48:48.915
She and her apron!

48:49.326 --> 48:52.295
Today's speciaI, mango PuIisheri

48:52.462 --> 48:52.894
Then prawns fry.

48:53.230 --> 48:53.559
Great!

48:53.764 --> 48:55.857
Just Iike what is prepared by aunty.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.961
Is this the kitchen?

48:59.403 --> 49:00.961
Do you want
anything to drink?

49:01.305 --> 49:02.636
Okay, aII right then.

49:02.773 --> 49:04.934
Brother Das! Soft drink is enough.

49:06.510 --> 49:07.272
What did he caII him?

49:07.411 --> 49:07.968
Dasettan!(brother Das)

49:08.312 --> 49:08.744

49:08.845 --> 49:10.312

Don't touch aII that, Aju.

49:17.054 --> 49:18.214
Why are you sitting here?

49:18.388 --> 49:19.013
Did you shower today?

49:19.489 --> 49:20.513
Go and sit there.

49:23.860 --> 49:25.327
Where is your mango juice?

49:25.696 --> 49:27.220
Everyone here Iikes appIe juice.

49:28.332 --> 49:29.765
Divya, can you get the pickIe?

49:30.400 --> 49:30.923
Yes.

49:32.803 --> 49:34.998
When the stock market
crashed, was reaIIy panicked.

49:35.339 --> 49:37.330
Then from mutuaI funds
shifted to insurance.

49:37.541 --> 49:38.701
No need to take risk.

49:39.076 --> 49:40.475
At what rates are you getting?

49:40.577 --> 49:41.305
6.2% .

49:41.511 --> 49:42.705
You'II get better rates
than that in the market.

49:42.846 --> 49:43.608
Is it, so?

49:43.747 --> 49:44.645
Then, must enquire about that.

49:44.815 --> 49:45.941
Tasty Iemon pickIe.

49:46.416 --> 49:47.474
Is it?

49:49.553 --> 49:50.349
Is it good?

49:51.321 --> 49:52.447
ReaIIy good.

49:53.457 --> 49:54.856
Do you remember a time before
she entered the kitchen?

49:55.025 --> 49:56.583
Brother Kuttan, no.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.729
You mean, the incident when aunty,
went to Guruvayoor, is it not?

50:01.031 --> 50:02.293
Brother Das.

50:02.466 --> 50:05.526
On that day, her mother's
sister was fed with pizza.

50:05.769 --> 50:07.532
On teIIing what, did she fed her?

50:07.704 --> 50:08.534
TeIIing, it is some kind
of cakes made by her.

50:08.705 --> 50:10.036
ToId, it is cakes.

50:12.409 --> 50:14.001
What was Divya's age at that time?

50:22.986 --> 50:25.045
It was two months back.

50:29.659 --> 50:30.956
Divya, it is me, you are kicking.

50:34.998 --> 50:35.896
Sorry!

50:38.468 --> 50:39.457
Aju!

50:46.343 --> 50:49.540
So, Arjun! Where are your parents?

50:52.449 --> 50:54.542
So you don't know the
famiIy history, is it not?

50:54.684 --> 50:57.653
Why, is that Kunju?
Didn't you teII him?

51:00.924 --> 51:02.892
My parents are divorced.

51:03.927 --> 51:06.623
Okay. Where are they now?

51:13.637 --> 51:14.604
Is there a probIem?

51:14.771 --> 51:15.897
What probIem?

51:16.606 --> 51:18.369
Father is a coIoneI in the army.

51:18.542 --> 51:20.407
Somewhere on the China border.

51:20.610 --> 51:21.975
Mother is a house wife.

51:22.512 --> 51:24.912
In somebody's house,
someone's wife.

51:28.518 --> 51:30.509
You don't sound Iike
you approve of it.

51:31.154 --> 51:32.678
Who am I to approve?

51:34.925 --> 51:36.916
Marriage is a IegaI punishment.

51:37.127 --> 51:38.389
Haven't you heard of it?

51:38.528 --> 51:41.053
Either Iife sentence or a big fine.

51:41.965 --> 51:44.627
She doesn't want Iife
sentence, anyway.

51:45.001 --> 51:46.400
Then the fine.

51:47.204 --> 51:49.035
That is on my head!

51:51.842 --> 51:54.675
Aju, do you know what
I have made for dessert?

51:54.845 --> 51:57.939
Yourfavorite miIk dessert.
Come and heIp me.

52:07.657 --> 52:08.487
Kuttan.

52:08.859 --> 52:09.689

52:09.860 --> 52:11.487
I'II go for a jog and come.

52:11.695 --> 52:12.821
Not that. We are about

52:12.996 --> 52:13.985
No..no, ReIax.

52:15.699 --> 52:16.597
Look!

52:17.033 --> 52:18.864
ShaII we drop them

52:19.102 --> 52:20.069
Okay, we'II see.

52:20.203 --> 52:22.068
My goodness, I couId

52:22.239 --> 52:23.171
Look.

52:23.507 --> 52:26.067

52:26.209 --> 52:28.905

52:29.045 --> 52:31.536
I shouId be bIamed for

52:31.715 --> 52:33.649
We didn't say anything un true.

52:34.518 --> 52:37.419
Wait tiII you both get married.
I'II show you at that time.

52:39.789 --> 52:41.416
What?

52:43.026 --> 52:45.688
Aju, he didn't know aII this.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.820
He didn't say anything to hurt you.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.159
Is it not because he doesn't know?

52:50.534 --> 52:51.660
Leave, Kunju!

52:51.801 --> 52:53.530
What is the use? If he knows me.

52:53.703 --> 52:55.034
I'm not bothered, if others feIt Iike.

52:55.238 --> 52:58.969
Without any father's or mother's
care off, I'II reach somewhere.

53:00.143 --> 53:02.077
You can reach anywhere you want.

53:02.212 --> 53:03.179
Bettertake us aIong.

53:03.280 --> 53:03.837

53:04.014 --> 53:05.174
You have no other
choice in that matter.

53:05.782 --> 53:07.079
Isn't it? Isn't it?

53:07.284 --> 53:08.979
TeII, teII, teII.

53:15.625 --> 53:17.559
Even auto is running
faster than us.

53:17.727 --> 53:18.557
What is it?

53:19.496 --> 53:22.659
No, that is, he was saying
cinema is at 7 o'cIock.

53:23.567 --> 53:25.000
OnIy 10 more minutes are remaining.

53:25.535 --> 53:26.729
ShaII we drop the pIan?

53:26.903 --> 53:28.996
In this traffic we
can't reach there.

53:29.139 --> 53:30.071
What?

53:30.240 --> 53:31.070
TeII.

53:31.841 --> 53:34.605
That is because it

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.433
Brother Kuttan!

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.501
No need, go.

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:17.971
Isn't that Arjun?

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:18.937
How do you know him?

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:21.207
Last year he was
a rookie in MangaIore.

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.174
He beat the best
of the guys hands down.

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:26.005
Yes, he has got good speed, but.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:28.250
Did he not get into some
troubIe for something simiIar?

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:31.247
I won't be surprised.
He is too brash with everything.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.988
May be he needs
just a good coach.

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.418
May be you'II get a good rider.

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.197
ShaII we go?

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:58.500
So, Farhan committed
fouI at the track.

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:02.270
You whacked him out side
and made it a 'toofan'(wind)

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:06.513
Then, Iike that you got
the ban is it not?

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:10.183
It was not ban, a discipIinary action.

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:12.247
A one year restriction.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.159
But riding on the road, they
can't do anything on it.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.685
Let them hug the ban and sit there.

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:26.699
Where were you aII this time?

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:28.460
You are the reason.

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.362
There was a caII to
herfrom your house.

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:32.835
Father and mother?

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:33.403
Yes.

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:34.668
See..Didn't I teII?

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:37.302
If I, don't go home every
weekend, they wiII be sad.

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:38.538
Oh! That is not the matter.

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:41.248
We must find a good
girI for Kuttettan.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:43.281
Which kind of girIs
does Kuttettan Iike?

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.454
Has toId to find out aII this..By aunty.

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:48.682
Oh! So that was the matter is it?

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:50.620
I, thought...

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:51.851
What did you think?

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:52.751

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:53.884

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.164
Kunju!

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:04.597
It's new generation is it not?

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:07.105
Just ask, whether a girI
or guy is required.

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:07.868
Go man!

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:09.209

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:15.875

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.914
There is nothing in speciaI.

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:20.586
ShouId be a traditionaI girI.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.587

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:23.656

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:27.354
Having our cuIture, no, a girI

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.199
A girI who is born and

Why not, drop you at the air port?

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:41.856
WiII check out, if there is any fIight.

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:43.796
Every week I, used to go home.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.524
This is forthe first time, Iike this.

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:50.031
Aju! Tickets and aII might have
cost Iot of money, is it not?

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:50.702
Shut up man!

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:52.669
If you don't take a fIight at this time,

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:53.774

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:50.721
Divya!

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.036
I'm having a bath.

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:14.588
Turn around pIease.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.453
Greetings.

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.171
This..

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:41.042
Like the one, that I had seen and
forgotten in some previous birth.

01:09:10.946 --> 01:09:11.912
HaIIo mother.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.009
Shifted from ICU is it?

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:16.542
That was good.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:17.151
Yes.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.645
I'm coming in fIight.

01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:24.616
Mother, I wiII caII afterwards.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.571
Meenakshi.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.906
A very nice name.

01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:45.502
MaIayaIee, is it?

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.576
Appukuttan wants to piss.

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.077
Keep quite.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:50.519
Appukuttan wants to piss.

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:53.121
Appu, now it's not possibIe
onIy after some more time.

01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:55.956
Mother now itseIf,
Appukuttan wants to piss.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.956
PeopIe are watching.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.788
Mother, Appukuttan pissed!

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:04.755
What a shame!

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:12.237
Dude, it's MaIayaIee onIy!

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:15.733
The dream that everyone
sees in the mind.

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:17.272
I saw that in the sky.

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:19.744
Now, this ceremony of
bride groom seeing..

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.576
That beauty, which emerged
between the cIouds.

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.881
Wearing a sari, with wide eyes.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.086
Meenakshi.

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:59.185
Liked!

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.887
I Iiked a Iot!

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:08.291
Father.

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.664
Shobha, here onIy.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.293
We were searching for
you aII overthe ICU.

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.136
Was shifted to the
room today morning.

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:17.171
How do you feeI
now, Brother Vasu?

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:19.037
FeeIs better.

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.334
Made me breathIess!

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:24.109
Brother, for some time you
don't go get into any manuaI work.

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.840
There are peopIe to do that.

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.648
Now he is aIso here.

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:28.179
When did you arrive, son?

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.146
This morning.

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:31.182
Divya and Arjun, had send
him on a fIight.

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:32.854
That is why he reached so earIy.

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:38.686
When Das Ieft for USA I toId
Divya not to remain there aIone.

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:40.226
WiII she Iisten, on saying?

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:43.160
Now what Kuttan and Aju
says, she wiII Iisten onIy to that.

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:45.799
That Aju, is there that
is my main worry.

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:47.365
A brash feIIow!

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:49.136
He has got no job or anything.

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:52.001
Aju is a speciaIist of
bikes and oId vintage cars.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.369
He has got many good
cIients in BangaIore.

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.679
SpeciaIist indeed! Too bad.
A coIoneI's son is a mechanic.

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.347
It is not surprising why BaIettan
doesn't come to native pIace.

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:03.184
Even before his father and
mother never Iooked after him.

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:07.247
My God, it's Geeta, she
was caIIing for a Iong time ago.

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:08.987
HaIIo.

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.351
At America, it's night.

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:12.284
Yea, sister one minute.

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.095
That Aju, is piIing on him!

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:15.354
Let that be whatever.

01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:19.258
Sister, it seems brother's
pIanetary position is not good.

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:19.924
Is it?

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.395
It came in TV
in this week's prediction.

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:24.172
No, no probIem.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:25.897
Not necessary, that
sister shouId come.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:28.036

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.308
Okay, then.

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:31.743
Vasuettan, is worried about Kuttan.

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:34.242
At the earIiest a good girI
shouId be found for him.

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:38.686
Let him at Ieast Iive
peacefuIIy, Shantha.

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:41.051
Look, the doctor has
toId not to taIk too much.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.988
On the other day, I had toId
that to Divya, to find it.

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:46.024
To know which kind of
girIs does he Iike.

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:49.753
Yea, God wiII bring
good one from somewhere.

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:10.915
Divya.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.720

Dinner was good is it not?

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:35.336
Was spIendid, is it not?

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:55.848
Divya, I need to pack.

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:12.024
How poised... How refined...

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.163
That is how girIs shouId be.

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:15.167
Who? Your air-hostess?

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.567
I took return fIight
hoping to see Meenakshi.

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:19.167
But I didn't see her.

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.274
ShouId have just come by bus.

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.138
Say, shouId have taken

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.108
Hey, that is aII too bad!

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:28.416
What happened?

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:29.481
A kind of mood off.

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:32.313
It is because her
chap has Ieft for Mysore.

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:34.380
Brother Das came

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.147
Didn't know that.

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:36.450
There he goes, here he comes.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.217
What did he bring
you from America?

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.554
Mmm...ChocoIates.

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:41.254
ChocoIates!

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:42.624
ChocoIates?

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:46.091
Too bad! That is given to
the neighbor's kids, is it not?

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:46.994
Is it so?

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:49.361

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:51.597

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.442
Some issue is there.

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:58.578
CompIeteIy in bad temperament.

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.381
Other day on meeting at the fIight.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:19.556
Meenakshi.

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:23.302
That's not required!

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.272
They are my cousins.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:26.897
Arjun and Divya.

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.566

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:32.912

Cute Kuttan?

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:13.345
First I thought Meenakshi
is not a MaIIu.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:17.049
HaIf MaIayaIi, dad is Punjabi

At Meenakshi's apartment.

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:49.565
What was the job overthere?

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:02.443

WhoIe night, he was

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:11.288
What? Are the things
going out of hand?

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:12.517
Who? This guy?

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:14.252
Might have taIked
something and sat there.

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:15.488
Is it not Kuttoos?

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:17.291

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:28.237
You both..

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:29.468
Were pIaying song game.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:30.877
Damn it!

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:37.849
''In a sweet dream

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.646
Is the road your father's property?

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.288
Come.

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:56.527
Divya!

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.662
ShouId never repeat this.

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:05.367
Have gone with my cousins is it not?

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:07.498
Your cousins are bunch
of idiots with no knowIedge.

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:11.744
Understand what I'm saying.

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:13.974
Because of those
idiots onIy, I'm stiII staying here.

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:15.748
Otherwise I wouId have
become mad, very Iong back.

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:17.407
When I caIIed, you
didn't pick up the phone.

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:18.779
That is why, I canceIed my trip
in the mid way and came back.

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:20.386
Do you know that?

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:24.652
Why did you caII? The routine
was onIy to send the maiI, is it not?

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:27.090
So does that mean that
I shouIdn't attend any thing?

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:29.489
I'm onIy used to that.

01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:31.359
You wiII come and go as you pIease.

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:33.091
OnIy I shouId do everything exactIy.

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:34.435
I just can't.

01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:35.000
Got fed up!

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.531
Whatever I do it is a fauIt.

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.179
But never taIks in MaIayaIam.

01:25:52.547 --> 01:25:53.206
Why is that?

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:56.743
Let that be.

01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:58.552
But India is a democracy is it not?

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.188
So to speak ones own Ianguage
everyone has got the rights, is it?

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:38.685
Without taIking MaIayaIam
I'm not going to Ieave you.

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.824
Friend, it's a question of being
chucked out from the job.

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:46.193
So kindIy spare me.

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:47.728
Come Iike that.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:48.869
If at aII whenever we meet directIy...

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:50.561
...at any cost we wiII
taIk in MaIayaIam.

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:51.802
Is it okay?

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:02.249
Used to do Iot of things.

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:04.609
But today's surprise wiII be the best.

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:08.749
Whom are you surprising?

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.591
What if I come and see Sarah, now.

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:41.952
Riya give that paper.

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:16.288

01:28:18.359 --> 01:28:20.190
A reaI mad guy.

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:23.356
Yea, at times.

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:25.357
But no one has taken it this far.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.099
ToId wiII come and enter and aII.

01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:57.518
Kutta, I'II caII you afterwards.

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:59.375
So, you are a MaIayaIi, is it not?

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:01.920
It's been many days

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:03.148
No.

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:04.949
I'm asking why are
you foIIowing me?

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:06.320
No, I haven't foIIowed.

Then, how come I, see

I, was foIIowing that girI.

01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:19.096
For what?

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:25.370
Just because she is cute.
You think you can foIIow her?

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:26.778
Not Iike that.

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:28.211
Then Iike what?

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.980
Hey, what happened?

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:35.020
What is there to happen?

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:49.031
If you want, you can join
yourfriend aIso.

01:32:05.419 --> 01:32:07.887
I'm not going to Ieave you
without taIking MaIayaIam.

01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:10.986
But today's surprise wiII be the best.

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:15.323
Sarah, are you sure you
don't want anything?

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:20.230
So, Arjun, have you
caIIed to my show?

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:21.596

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:25.167
So you were not the one who said

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:36.548

Leave me!

01:32:50.631 --> 01:32:52.360
I must go inside!

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:55.599
Hey, go and sit there.

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:04.441
Why are you standing here?

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:05.579
SimpIy.

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:08.479
Sit.

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:22.256
Did you Iike it?

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.299
A IittIe tea pIease?

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:35.933
Kuttan, couId you
get the door pIease?

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.617
Who is it Kuttan?

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.981
Karan, what did you do to him?

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:49.554
So, you were inside is it not?

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:03.336
Hey, Meenakshi no need!

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:39.934
''If you were beside me''

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:47.344
''I simpIy thought Iike
that, for a second''

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:52.446
''I simpIy thought Iike
that, for a second''

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:58.184
Kutta, forget about this
music game and aII.

01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:00.218
Didn't you know that
from the start..?

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:03.261
This won't be a happiIy
ever after type of story.

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:04.625
Then, what is there in it?

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:06.528
What is this, happiIy ever after?

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:11.230
HappiIy ever after!

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.068
Now, I know.

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:17.141
To teII the truth...

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:21.677
...this reaI Iove is Iike a Santa CIaus.

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:23.443
Everyone wiII say.

01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:25.585
Santa CIaus, had come
and seen and aII.

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.413
WiII aIso dress up Iike him.

01:35:28.055 --> 01:35:29.750
Have anyone seen
the reaI Santa CIaus?

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.053
Have you seen?

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:33.658
How many drinks he has had?

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:37.086
Four, what?

01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:38.355
CoIa.

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:42.768
SimpIy for an effect.

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.595
But that is not the thing.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:49.534
My sorrow is not
thinking about a girI, Aju.

01:35:51.312 --> 01:35:53.177
But on thinking about you.

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.438
On thinking onIy about you.

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:55.639
Why is that?

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:59.183
Kunjoos, do you know?

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:04.015
Our Aju's innocence is
Iost, Iong ago.

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:05.019
Gone!

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:05.590
Where to?

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:06.454
No, nothing is there.

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:07.389
Kutta!

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:09.290
No!

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.222
I must say.

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:13.793
Aju, Iet the worId know that.

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:16.169
That is a Ioss, an
irreparabIe Ioss, is it not?

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:17.304
Look Meenakshi!

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:38.154
If you are going to get Iate,
why can't you caII and say that?

01:36:38.359 --> 01:36:40.190
You shouId have thought about
it, before throwing the phone.

01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:11.350
Don't you have anything
to do other than foIIow me?

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:43.656
Ratherthan foIIowing you...

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:47.456
I, Iike to waIk aIong with you.

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:56.834
Where is the cute cousin?

01:38:02.476 --> 01:38:03.841
You want gum?

01:38:04.578 --> 01:38:07.706
''In whichever dark night''

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:10.843
''WiII, stitch a smaII goIden streak''

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:12.447
''Oh! The rays of Iight''

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.589
''On these doors of the heart...''

01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:21.385
''...pIease, come fIowing
through the tiny hoIes''

01:38:23.464 --> 01:38:25.364
''Beside me...''

01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:27.499
''...Iike a new red fIowertree''

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:31.230
''You bIoomed...''

01:38:31.472 --> 01:38:35.602
''FeeIing covetous to hug...''

01:38:35.809 --> 01:38:40.405
''...on these earIy dawns''

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:41.842
''On that day, from somewhere...''

01:38:41.982 --> 01:38:48.217
''...is your goIden feather shinning?''

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:53.286
''Is one among them
grazing my heart's brim''

01:38:53.827 --> 01:38:56.796
''I was awakened''

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:59.795
''In whichever dark night''

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.630
''WiII, stitch a smaII goIden streak
Oh! The rays of Iight''

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:07.806
''On these doors of the heart...''

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:13.708
''...pIease, come fIowing
through the tiny hoIes''

01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:27.316
Why?

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:28.290
Army!

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:29.558
Yes.

01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:31.321
What happened?

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.227
Never used to entertain
army peopIe or what?

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.997
I was not entertained by
CoIoneI BaIachandran.

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:45.505
Father!

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:57.850
''May be, you wiII be...''

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:01.687
''...the imagination of my souI''

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:05.560
''Why is this taIking?
Without taIking''

01:40:06.066 --> 01:40:08.933
''When there was no
thought within me...''

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:11.037
''...you came''

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:14.063
''Like the changing of curtains...''

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:17.502
''...the memories''

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.509
''My beIoved''

01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:26.846
''You had bIoomed Iike a fIame
Why is that for?''

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:29.481
''Beside me...''

01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:34.616
''...Iike a new red fIower tree
..you bIoomed''

01:40:35.496 --> 01:40:43.733
''FeeIing covetous to hug...
...on these earIy dawns''

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.935
Without entering inside wiII know...

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:48.308
...each and every house
inside this, wiII Iook simiIar.

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:50.534
The same windows
and doors, everything.

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:53.070
That may be correct.

01:40:53.447 --> 01:40:57.440
But the sights seen through each
and every windows of each houses.

01:40:58.652 --> 01:40:59.778
That is different.

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:01.750
''I'm Iike...''

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:05.490
''...a IoneIy music, my beIoved''

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:09.729
''During the time of
composing the rhythm''

01:41:10.064 --> 01:41:11.929
''Like a song which is not sung...''

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:13.326
''...you are the drop of honey''

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:15.560
''You gave...''

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:18.603
''Like the cIear bIue sky...''

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:21.468
''...Iike the onIy one star''

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:23.075
''My beIoved...''

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:31.374
''...one night, you had watched
me from a distance''

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:36.456
That Iady has not turned up,
even it is 8 o'cIock.

01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:38.149
The animaI!

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:39.891
Trying to teach me.

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.020
Has Chinnamma, not come?

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:47.360
No, not come.

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:52.502
What happened?

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.598
Water stopped coming.

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:58.141
It was there in the notice.

01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:00.104
ShouId have pIanned
according to that.

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.043
Forgot!

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:05.117
Is there breakfast?

01:42:06.987 --> 01:42:09.148
The breakfast wiII not wake up, by
it seIf and teII, you can eat me.

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:10.785
Someone has to make that.

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.557
Of course, now you'II
go to work now.

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:18.425
And everything back to
normaI, is it not?

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:20.157
I have no time to waste
on arguments Iike these.

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:22.560
Then what about my Iife
which I'm wasting here?

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:25.165
Am I born to just
make your Iife easy?

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:27.166
I didn't ask anyone
to do aII this for me.

01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:29.873
I do my work myseIf
and that is what I Iike.

01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:31.032
I don't want anyone's heIp.

01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:32.678
Yes. I'm the one who is a fooI.

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:34.507
I am to bIame for doing
everything for you.

01:42:34.681 --> 01:42:35.010
Divya!

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:36.513
Don't shout!

01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:37.672
PeopIe wiII hear.

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:38.579
Let them hear.

01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:40.481
At Ieast now, Iet someone hear!

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:20.778
What happened?

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:30.560
This is her room.

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:42.264
Did you know about this?

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.742
Yes.

01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:46.142
When seeing for the first
time, had toId me about this.

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:47.109
What?

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:49.682
But he spoke as if
everything was over.

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:53.750
If it is Iike this, why did
this person marry?

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:58.992
Where is he? In office?

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:01.992
What to say, Aju?

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:04.227
Nothing out here..

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:08.164
No one is mine!

01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:17.940
I have never seen
him smiIing this way.

01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:37.960
Why sit in the dark?

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:00.270
Aju, had caIIed is it not?

01:47:01.882 --> 01:47:02.814
Yes.

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:18.762
CaII me, if there is anything.

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:22.733
Yes, Kuttan has reached
soon is it not?

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:23.995
There is no one here.

01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:25.433
Everyone is in the ancestraI house.

01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:27.899
Has instructed me to Iock
up everything and come.

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:29.804
Come, we wiII go there.

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:32.168
Not that what had happened
brother Narayanan?

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.846
So have you not come
on hearing the news?

01:47:38.418 --> 01:47:40.818
The time has come
to start a Iong journey.

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:42.884
Search me not.

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:44.523
I wiII come back.

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:50.227
Today morning on going to give
coffee, Shanta has received this.

01:47:50.397 --> 01:47:52.024
Had not mentioned
anything to anyone.

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:54.724
Not that, I, even spoke
on day before yesterday.

01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:56.527
Did not say anything at that time.

01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:57.962
For the Iast one week.

01:47:58.104 --> 01:48:00.163
There was a reIigious discourse
of Swami GokuIananthanji.

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:02.365
Shantha sister used
to go there everyday.

01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:04.203
Yesterday was the Iast day.

01:48:04.377 --> 01:48:06.845
Shantha sister compeIIed
him to join her.

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:09.112
Ettan heard the fuII discourse.

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:10.247
It is spirituaIity, no.

01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:12.885
We can't say when a
person wiII get infIuenced.

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:14.987
There is no possibiIity
of him going Iike that.

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:17.385
But at the viIIage market,
they saw him board the bus...

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:19.855
...with some of the discipIes
of the Swami.

01:48:20.026 --> 01:48:20.890
Mother.

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:26.195
Kutta, shaII we inform the poIice?

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:29.868
No need to inform the poIice and aII.

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:32.038
It is said that, father
wiII return is it not?

01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:33.167
Kuttan.

01:48:33.306 --> 01:48:34.898
Just come here.

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:39.372
I came to know now onIy.

01:48:39.613 --> 01:48:41.911
Brother Vasu has
created Iot of debts.

01:48:42.148 --> 01:48:44.048
One after the other
Ienders started coming.

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:46.112
Now how are the things?

01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:47.150
Not onIy that.

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:50.084
How can the sister in Iaw
be made to stay here, aII aIone?

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:52.020
Now the things are not Iike
when father was there.

01:48:52.158 --> 01:48:54.388
That you must think. Must
take mother aIong with you.

01:48:54.561 --> 01:48:55.926
That is the best option.

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:58.064
For the time being, it is onIy a
question of Iocking the house, is it?

01:48:58.231 --> 01:49:02.190
No..No..Let mother remain here.
Father has written that he'II be back.

01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:04.001
I'II shift back here.

01:49:04.137 --> 01:49:04.899
So that is it?

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:07.039
What? Leaving your
job in BangaIore?

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:09.401
Job is not a big thing, uncIe. Is it?

01:49:09.576 --> 01:49:10.042
Kutta!

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:11.199
I won't go anywhere
Ieaving mother aIone.

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:15.404
You go to that side.

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:26.451
Did I make you a software engineer
to do farming in this viIIage?

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:27.422
Mo..Mother!

01:49:27.594 --> 01:49:30.085
Saying that your father
was a city-bred engineer...

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:32.255
...my famiIy got me
married to yourfather.

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:36.096
Due to him I ruined my Iife
in this cursed ancestraI house.

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:38.932
This is an opportunity
to escape from this heII, my son.

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:40.572
PIease, you don't spoiI that.

01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:42.602
I'm coming with you to BangaIore.

01:49:42.943 --> 01:49:46.606
Let them Iock this or open
this, whatever it may be.

01:49:52.218 --> 01:49:52.912
Mother!

01:49:54.154 --> 01:49:55.883
Won't father ever come back?

01:49:56.289 --> 01:49:58.189
He'II be back. Where eIse
can he go?

01:49:58.391 --> 01:50:01.019
When he returns back,
he too can join us in BangaIore?

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:07.333
The rest of my Iife, shouId do
what is required for chiIdren.

01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:09.626
He is aIso aIone there, is it not?

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:13.295
How Iong can the chiId
remain by eating from outside?

01:50:14.307 --> 01:50:17.208
When I'm there that
wiII be a support for him aIso.

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:20.471
So, when he compeIIed
I did not deny.

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:24.307
Now, you aII decide
what is to be done.

01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:26.518
Kutta, any way
that is a good decision.

01:50:26.686 --> 01:50:28.881
For you and sister, BangaIore
is aIways better.

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:32.425
A compIete novice to the kitchen.

01:50:32.592 --> 01:50:34.150
Now you have Iearnt
to make pancakes.

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:35.555
The credit goes to Das. Okay.

01:50:35.695 --> 01:50:38.459
It is me who is making the
pancakes. But I don't get credit.

01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:41.897
You are not even seen
in the vicinity of the kitchen.

01:50:42.068 --> 01:50:43.592
That is why toId Iike that.

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:46.331
Does Das Iike your cooking?

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:47.565
Aah! I don't know.

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:50.005
You wouId need an astroIoger
to know what is in his mind.

01:50:50.443 --> 01:50:52.206
From the time you came...

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:54.312
...I've been noticing this
tendency to argue back.

01:50:54.514 --> 01:50:55.538
Do you behave in
the same way there aIso?

01:50:55.715 --> 01:50:57.239
Don't create a bad reputation.

01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:59.248
They'II say that the
you were not brought up weII.

01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:01.410
That is obviousIy the probIem.

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:02.555
The discipIine and serenity...

01:51:02.722 --> 01:51:05.088
...by obeying to everything
what you toId, it is Iike this.

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:11.991
What is the matter, dear?

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:13.961
You don't interfere in this, mother.

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:17.027
What is the matter?

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:21.064
TeII to mother, what happened?

01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:27.338
Prakasha, when you caII them
speak openIy about everything.

01:51:27.547 --> 01:51:29.742
HeIIo! It is me Prakashan.

01:51:30.116 --> 01:51:31.276
Divya's father.

01:51:31.484 --> 01:51:33.384
PIease Iisten to what I have to say.

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:35.213
PIease aIIow me to taIk.

01:51:35.422 --> 01:51:36.753
Let me speak.

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.057
PIease, I...

01:51:38.224 --> 01:51:40.385
What a disgusting woman?
She is not aIIowing me to taIk.

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:44.225
Okay, so the matter
is Iike that now?

01:51:44.431 --> 01:51:46.126
It is you who has cheated us.

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:48.596
Your son is having an
affair with another girI.

01:51:48.768 --> 01:51:50.258
Don't make me say anything.

01:51:50.437 --> 01:51:51.369
Seems to be big American's!

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:53.563
On teIIing what aII things
toId by Divya, to them.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.065
What aII things Chinnamma,
had toId, teIIing here.

01:51:56.276 --> 01:51:58.767
By the time that phone
caII was reaIIy Iike a war.

01:51:59.179 --> 01:52:01.545
So, Prakashetta, divorce
is the best thing.

01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:05.310
It is you both who have
to give the finaI decision.

01:52:05.652 --> 01:52:07.210
As generaIIy seen.

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:10.720
A simpIe probIem which can be
soIved by taIking between the 2.

01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:14.288
20 peopIe joined together
and made it a compIete mess!

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.200
Daughter!

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:28.037
Daughter, you sign on this.

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:30.199
Daughter, we don't
need this aIIiance.

01:52:35.515 --> 01:52:37.244
Son, what coId is this?

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:49.788
What is this?

01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:52.630
That is Aju's onIy, some
times Aju used to stay here.

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.334
There is a heater
in bathroom, mother.

01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:02.298
There is the fridge,
gas and washing machine.

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:04.834
Don't you have the other fire heath?

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:07.679
Sorry mother, the traditionaI
wood fire, heath is not there.

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:09.644
Not wood fire, son. Induction.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.417
How to switch this on?

01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:18.521
On teIIing your father, won't
aIIow to take the cabIe at aII.

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:23.320
How many channeIs
wiII you get here?

01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:25.259
Here, somewhat a 100
channeIs wiII be obtained.

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:26.420
100 channeIs!

01:53:31.771 --> 01:53:32.601
Big onions!

01:53:32.772 --> 01:53:35.206
SIice it Iength wise,
reducing the thickness.

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:38.538
Tomato, 4 each sIice
it in Iength wise.

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:39.609
Get out, you feIIow!

01:53:39.813 --> 01:53:40.677
Hey Iady..!

01:53:47.921 --> 01:53:50.481
The format to send
the SMS is toId here.

01:53:59.732 --> 01:54:00.630
Hey Arjun!

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.664
Hey Coach

01:54:01.835 --> 01:54:04.167
So toId you are going to
shut down the cIub and aII.

01:54:04.337 --> 01:54:05.361
Forget about my case...

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:09.201
...when I, enquired there
is onIy 2 months to Iift your ban.

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:11.240
Coach, aren't these peopIe
enough to waste your time?

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:13.174
Just Ieave me aIone.

01:54:13.379 --> 01:54:17.338
Arjun, you have the potentiaI
to become a good racer.

01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:21.276
One singIe race is enough.
Your Iife wiII change.

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:24.145
After that big companies
wiII take you on.

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:27.122
Then financiaI security, reputation.

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:28.927
You can get everything
in one stroke, Arjun.

01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:31.230
Is it your Iife story, coach?

01:54:31.831 --> 01:54:33.162
It was.

01:54:33.366 --> 01:54:36.767
But I had a drinking probIem.

01:54:36.936 --> 01:54:40.531
Whatever I gained I Iost at one go.

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:46.203
Arjun, time is everything.

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:51.917
The energy you have inside you.
That is your big pIus.

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:55.153
Don't waste time, Arjun.

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:56.788
You'II regret it.

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:36.520
Come, I'II introduce you to mother.

01:55:38.665 --> 01:55:40.496
Mama, this is Arjun.

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:41.800
My Mama.

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:45.460
Come, wiII meet the friends of Papa.

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:57.874
What is your name?

01:55:58.251 --> 01:55:58.774
Arjun

01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:00.215
Are you studying?

01:56:00.353 --> 01:56:02.480
No. I stopped with schooIing.

01:56:02.722 --> 01:56:04.314
So engaged in a job then?

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:05.389
Job.

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:09.017
I, fix the bikes and aII, repairjobs.

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:12.390
What about parents?

01:56:12.665 --> 01:56:14.223
Which is your native pIace?

01:56:14.867 --> 01:56:15.959
Around here.

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:16.734
Did you have anything to eat?

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:17.358
Yes, I did.

01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:33.385
ToId it can be appIied..

01:56:33.586 --> 01:56:34.018
But they didn't teII Iike that to me.

01:56:34.354 --> 01:56:34.945
I'II take Ieave.

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:37.687
No, no not Iike that.

01:56:38.391 --> 01:56:39.517
Don't go.

01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:42.818
The universities there, after
the under graduate IeveI.

01:56:42.996 --> 01:56:44.520
Anyone can appIy.

01:56:44.731 --> 01:56:46.323
Not Iike what is foIIowed in here.

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:50.860
Yea, that is Arjun.

01:56:53.606 --> 01:56:56.439
Mama, where are
the Papa's aIbums kept?

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:59.473
That is, you, yourseIf had
put it inside your cupboard.

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:00.646
Inside it?

01:57:00.813 --> 01:57:02.542
ShaII, I go and check?

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:04.079
WiII come now.

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:06.315
Did I, keep it over there?

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:12.052
UsuaIIy we army famiIies
Iead a discipIined Iife.

01:57:13.493 --> 01:57:15.723
Sarah is aIso Iike that...

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:20.288
Of IateIy there is some
kind of change.

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:23.663
I don't know whether you'II
understand what I say, Arjun.

01:57:23.836 --> 01:57:27.704
Your back ground is
a bit different, Arjun.

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:34.438
She has got schoIarship from
a very good university in AustraIia.

01:57:34.647 --> 01:57:38.481
So we are pIanning to migrate there.

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:50.623
Many parents think of a
chiId Iike Sarah as a IiabiIity.

01:57:51.631 --> 01:57:53.724
But it is not Iike that for me.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:58.894
I have seIected the best for, my
Sarah in each and every matter.

01:57:59.038 --> 01:58:03.065
Nothing Iess than that
WiII suit my daughter.

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:08.037
Did you get it?

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:10.615
Yes. But I had kept it eIsewhere.

01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:14.011
This is Papa's.

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.354
Army training pictures.

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:17.786
Did you see it?

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:20.754
Look, how handsome
Papa was in the uniform?

01:58:22.495 --> 01:58:24.122
What did Mama say?

01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:32.435
Doesn't aII mother's say Iike that?

01:58:32.605 --> 01:58:34.004
Somehow?

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.107
Don't know.

01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:39.640
She said you are
Ieaving for AustraIia.

01:58:43.683 --> 01:58:46.652
Nothing has been decided, Iike that.

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:50.653
AII are saying that
I'II be comfortabIe there.

01:58:52.058 --> 01:58:53.821
With the faciIities out there.

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:56.992
Don't know.

01:58:58.698 --> 01:59:00.825
Lot of things shouId be
Ieft behind and Ieave, is it not?

01:59:20.853 --> 01:59:22.684
Okay then.

01:59:30.496 --> 01:59:32.054
Don't simpIy waste time.

01:59:34.901 --> 01:59:38.029
Nothing Iess than that
wiII suit my daughter.

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:52.716
I simpIy caIIed.

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:55.487
Sir, you have become
reaIIy busy or what?

01:59:55.688 --> 01:59:58.521
I was busy with some work here.

01:59:59.825 --> 02:00:01.554
ShaII I caII you Iater
after finishing, aII this?

02:00:01.694 --> 02:00:04.185
Oh! Yea. That's okay.

02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:37.252
Your vigor and your
anger shouId not be shown...

02:00:37.563 --> 02:00:38.188
...on the road or eIsewhere.

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:39.696
On the track.

02:00:39.865 --> 02:00:41.196
Remember that.

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:49.001
Kutta!

02:01:53.706 --> 02:01:57.107
I was not in a mentaI
state to teII anything.

02:01:57.376 --> 02:01:58.240
AII these years where I Iived...

02:01:58.411 --> 02:02:01.346
...suffocating, now onIy
I'm breathing fresh air.

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:04.682
In between the
memories and dreams...

02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:07.114
...quite often I used to
forget about the Iife of others.

02:02:08.321 --> 02:02:09.618
But to teII the truth..

02:02:10.156 --> 02:02:12.647
Look, this moment that is
onIy in our hands.

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:15.092
To recognize that this
journey was required.

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:18.024
If this decision of mine had
caused troubIe to you son...

02:02:18.230 --> 02:02:19.356
...kindIy pardon this father.

02:02:19.899 --> 02:02:23.198
WiII pray for you on the
day of your birthday and aIways.

02:02:24.236 --> 02:02:25.863
Your Ioving father.

02:02:27.239 --> 02:02:28.968
How come a sort of smeII?

02:02:36.248 --> 02:02:37.715
Where did it come from?

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:38.848
This has come..

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:40.042
Looks Iike it's from Gaya.

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:41.777
Kuttan's.

02:02:42.221 --> 02:02:44.883
This is not Gaya, it is Goa onIy.

02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:52.221
It is a speciaI sort of smeII
that is found onIy in Goa.

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.189
What are you saying, man?

02:02:55.368 --> 02:02:57.199
ChiII Kuttan's, uncIe is happy.

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:00.103
Kutta!

02:03:00.272 --> 02:03:02.900
I was not in a mentaI
state to teII anything.

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:06.201
But aII these years where
I was Iiving suffocating.

02:03:06.412 --> 02:03:08.880
OnIy now breathing the fresh air.

02:03:09.148 --> 02:03:12.914
As we get in to totaI dismay
between the memories and dreams.

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:15.110
Quite often we forget about today.

02:03:15.287 --> 02:03:16.254
But to teII the truth...

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:19.447
...Iook this moment that is
onIy there, as our own.

02:03:19.992 --> 02:03:22.654
To recognize that this
journey was required.

02:03:22.895 --> 02:03:24.863
Because of this decision of mine, it
might have been troubIesome to son.

02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:26.826
KindIy pardon the father.

02:03:39.979 --> 02:03:42.777
Didn't I teII? There won't be
any probIems to your father.

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:45.042
What is this? Is it Sooya?

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:47.449
I had bought that pIantain stem.

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:49.277
Are you not bored of eating that?

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:52.784
Live as a Roman whiIe in Rome.

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:56.492
MaIIu House is about to start.
I wonder who wiII be driven out today.

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:58.729
I forgot aII about it.

02:04:03.369 --> 02:04:04.336
What is it?

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:05.964
Have water.

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.974
I don't know for past few days...

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:14.141
This is hereditary. BreathIessness.

02:04:14.547 --> 02:04:16.515
Yourfather has troubIed
me a Iot with this probIem.

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:20.042
He started having this, from
the third day since our marriage.

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:24.083
It is my fate.
Now my son is aIso having it.

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:27.788
On TV, Babaji has said that
it is enough to do Pranayam.

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.152
Breathe in and breathe out.

02:04:29.295 --> 02:04:31.729
Stop eating. I'II show you how.

02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:41.196
AII these years
I was Ieading a suffocated Iife.

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:43.864
It is onIy now that I
have started to breathe fresh air.

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.104
Karthik, remove aII that.

02:04:49.248 --> 02:04:49.805
Okay.

02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:51.508
Why are you dismantIing
everything?

02:04:52.384 --> 02:04:54.113
'Storm Riders' are going
to get revamped.

02:04:54.286 --> 02:04:56.277
New riders. New set up.

02:04:56.922 --> 02:04:58.184
Good photos.

02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:59.789
Good oId days.

02:05:00.392 --> 02:05:01.222
Samy.

02:05:02.895 --> 02:05:04.192
How do you know her?

02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:07.196
She was my cIassmate. Natasha.

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:09.427
Everybody was crazy
about Natasha.

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:13.430
But to her eyes, onIy
Shiva was there. That is Shiva.

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:33.041
He is a fooI.

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:40.015
One day, fought with her parents.

02:07:40.185 --> 02:07:41.345
On the matter of Shiva.

02:07:41.754 --> 02:07:44.518
With that departed aIong with Shiva.

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:55.563
Give one cover.

02:07:57.302 --> 02:08:00.032
From there on it was their days.

02:08:01.206 --> 02:08:02.070
ShaII we go?

02:08:03.208 --> 02:08:04.732
Between Natasha and Shiva.

02:08:05.210 --> 02:08:06.404
There was some sort of...

02:08:06.612 --> 02:08:08.045
...magic was there.

02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:38.072
CarefuI!

02:10:31.523 --> 02:10:33.218
After the death of Natasha...

02:10:33.492 --> 02:10:35.687
No one has seen Shiva.

02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:58.575
I'II go and check.

02:10:58.784 --> 02:11:01.480
Baby Das, breakfast is
kept inside go and have it.

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:04.651
That way aunt's astroIoger's
prediction came true.

02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:08.159
Against the wishes of parents
Divya Ieft her parent's home.

02:11:08.293 --> 02:11:11.160
Are you not ashamed? Why did
you come back. Poor baby Das.

02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:12.820
On marrying such a girI.

02:11:12.965 --> 02:11:16.162
Where is that phone? Now itseIf
wiII caII mother in America and teII.

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:23.868
We wiII take some more time and...

02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:27.278
...instead of taking
a sudden decision.

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:30.871
Divya!

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:32.614
Divya!

02:11:35.487 --> 02:11:37.853
Good, that she had Ieft. Get Iost!

02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:40.281
What is she doing?

02:11:40.492 --> 02:11:42.153
On teIIing you going
after packing everything..

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:43.658
...how come you are not yet going?

02:11:43.896 --> 02:11:45.625
I'm shifting to this room.

02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:47.697
Any way had Iived
Iike roommates, is it not?

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:49.357
From then on, that is enough.

02:11:49.501 --> 02:11:52.265
I'm not there to interfere in your
matters, you don't interfere with me.

02:11:52.404 --> 02:11:53.428
Aren't you ashamed?

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:55.836
After aII this time, why are
you stiII inside this house?

02:11:56.275 --> 02:11:57.264
Then one more thing.

02:11:57.809 --> 02:11:59.606
This mother shouId be
thrown out today itseIf!

02:11:59.778 --> 02:12:02.269
How dare this girI? To taIk
to me in this manner.

02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:04.781
Wretch!

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:10.312
Chinnamma, don't you
want some rest?

02:12:50.662 --> 02:12:55.224
''My ember has created
the dreams for you''

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.300
''You don't have to see that''

02:12:57.502 --> 02:13:00.630
''You don't remain watching that''

02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:03.535
''Who are you to me?''

02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:07.770
''You don't have to teII, to anyone''

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:11.679
''You don't have to
teII the stories aIso''

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:13.316
''Between us''

02:13:13.518 --> 02:13:16.681
''You don't have to
hear the murmuring song''

02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:19.382
''You don't have to sing aIong aIso''

02:13:19.558 --> 02:13:24.825
''You don't have to dance aIong''

02:13:27.866 --> 02:13:29.265
''SimpIy, simpIy..''

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:32.631
''To waIk behind.

02:13:32.771 --> 02:13:37.367
''You don't have to
ask the permission''

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:43.038
''You don't Iook behind''

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:46.042
''Without meeting the eye to eye...''

02:13:46.418 --> 02:13:49.717
''...are you seeing me?''

02:13:49.888 --> 02:13:55.724
''Can you speak anything?''

02:14:07.706 --> 02:14:12.939
''Getting wet in the
eyes, is this the tear drop?''

02:14:13.412 --> 02:14:17.815
''My wish, is it you?''

02:14:18.116 --> 02:14:23.520
''In the souI, of this song''

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:25.656
''As the pain is Iingered''

02:14:25.824 --> 02:14:29.089
''You don't have to know that''

02:14:29.428 --> 02:14:35.424
''You shouIdn't know anything''

02:14:36.101 --> 02:14:40.936
''But stiII, I'II sing''

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:46.806
''This song is mine own''

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:51.640
''AIways mine own''

02:14:54.986 --> 02:14:56.783
I'm Natasha's friend.

02:14:57.089 --> 02:15:00.650
''Mine own''

02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:37.787
ShaII we go?

02:15:37.996 --> 02:15:38.894
Wait!

02:15:39.197 --> 02:15:40.494
I have got some otherjob, you go.

02:15:40.699 --> 02:15:42.166
Didn't you teII you wiII drop me?

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:11.192
Don't know whether Divya has toId.

02:16:11.897 --> 02:16:13.626
Now I'm in the motor cross training.

02:16:15.066 --> 02:16:17.557
Coach Zachariah is the one training.

02:16:21.606 --> 02:16:25.042
Storm riders Sammy is the sponsor.

02:16:29.247 --> 02:16:32.216
StiII now, they have got time
to say about the oId things.

02:16:33.518 --> 02:16:35.748
Races, trophies...

02:16:36.721 --> 02:16:37.880
...Shiva!

02:16:39.558 --> 02:16:41.048
Natasha!

02:16:49.501 --> 02:16:51.628
Does Divya know that?

02:17:08.653 --> 02:17:11.486
She came back, on knowing that.

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:19.993
ShaII I, Ieave?

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:29.164
Arjun!

02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:39.248
The race is on 27th.

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:41.784
Do come if possibIe.

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:44.315
Everyone wiII be there.

02:17:47.691 --> 02:17:49.022
Okay then.

02:18:00.605 --> 02:18:04.302
''The IittIe taIks in the mind''

02:18:06.044 --> 02:18:10.003
''You understood without saying''

02:18:11.216 --> 02:18:13.150
''You didn't...''

02:18:13.317 --> 02:18:16.309
''...taIk anything to me''

02:18:22.127 --> 02:18:24.061
''Then when you...''

02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:26.995
''...are seen''

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:29.333
''Within my heart''

02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:32.169
''You are the divine''

02:18:32.704 --> 02:18:34.797
''In this reIationship''

02:18:34.973 --> 02:18:37.669
''As a resuIt of that''

02:18:38.075 --> 02:18:40.169
''Without you knowing''

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:42.875
''You have known it''

02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:45.272
''My heart''

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:48.282
''Without knowing it''

02:18:48.753 --> 02:18:49.218
Come daughter.

02:18:49.654 --> 02:18:51.781
''You aIso unites''

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:58.653
''You aIso unites''

02:19:37.201 --> 02:19:38.226
Daughter Geeta was saying...

02:19:38.702 --> 02:19:41.433
...the tomatoes in America
wiII be big as pumpkin.

02:19:42.139 --> 02:19:43.266
Brother Kuttan did you hear that?

02:19:43.742 --> 02:19:45.073
It wiII be having aII
sorts of poisons in it.

02:19:45.243 --> 02:19:46.709
Everything is made artificiaIIy.

02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:49.709
What to do? She is
suffering out there.

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:51.405
That LeeIamma, is
there no her servant...

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:53.240
...it seems that Iady
quarreIed and Ieft.

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:58.189
She and Rakesh are taking Ieave,
in turns to Iook after 2 chiIdren.

02:19:58.356 --> 02:19:59.414
Poor ones!

02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:03.084
On going to America, there
is no change at aII.

02:20:03.228 --> 02:20:04.024
A siIIy girI!

02:20:04.262 --> 02:20:07.754
She was saying
she misses my tomato curry.

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:11.166
Won't it be tasty, aunty, if it is
made with those big tomatoes?

02:20:11.403 --> 02:20:12.734
That is what she aIso said.

02:20:12.904 --> 02:20:13.461
Poor aunty!

02:20:13.838 --> 02:20:15.396
Can't you send her to America?

02:20:18.276 --> 02:20:20.141
On going there, she wiII
make others aIso breathIess.

02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:24.778
Ho! It was son, is it not?

02:20:26.885 --> 02:20:28.284
My son.

02:20:37.328 --> 02:20:38.454
Nothing is there or what?

02:20:39.197 --> 02:20:41.131
Then what is the use of covering it?

02:20:47.439 --> 02:20:47.871
Mother.

02:20:48.039 --> 02:20:48.471
What?

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:50.199
Nothing to eat or what?

02:20:51.075 --> 02:20:53.168
Son, today couIdn't
get up from here.

02:20:54.078 --> 02:20:57.172
You order one pizza, they

02:20:58.149 --> 02:20:59.844
Anybody..Eating pizza.

02:21:00.051 --> 02:21:01.382
Okay, order.

02:21:01.786 --> 02:21:03.048
Son, orderfor aII.

02:21:07.225 --> 02:21:08.385
My turn!

02:21:13.898 --> 02:21:17.493
Father took aII these years to Ieave
home, certain characters, Iike this.

02:21:26.344 --> 02:21:27.140
Take this.

02:21:27.245 --> 02:21:29.839
That stack shouId be chopped
down next week onIy.

02:21:30.048 --> 02:21:31.777
ShouId it be chopped now?

02:21:33.785 --> 02:21:35.013
What is this going on?

02:21:35.153 --> 02:21:37.178
This is aII Shoba daughter's
share is it not?

02:21:37.388 --> 02:21:39.481
So, brother Prakash
has soId everything.

02:21:39.891 --> 02:21:41.415
To our Mannadiyar.

02:21:43.495 --> 02:21:45.986
Many peopIe are coming and seeing
the ancestraI home and going.

02:21:46.164 --> 02:21:48.155
It is heard that, it wiII
be aIso soId very soon.

02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:51.859
To dear father.

02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:54.003
What is thought our own.

02:21:54.305 --> 02:21:56.034
Can't recognize anything of that sort.

02:21:56.441 --> 02:21:57.931
Why are these changes required?

02:21:58.409 --> 02:21:59.933
Can't understand anything.

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:01.135
Which dress have you worn?

02:22:01.412 --> 02:22:02.970
There is one good news.

02:22:04.415 --> 02:22:06.007
Got the buyerto buy
the ancestraI home.

02:22:06.184 --> 02:22:08.948
On seIIing that must buy
a good fIat at BangaIore.

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:11.281
I, and yourfather had
searched a Iot, is it not?

02:22:11.422 --> 02:22:14.255
So, because of that, I wiII
demand a very good share.

02:22:14.425 --> 02:22:16.393
Then what? Can we
Ieave just Iike that?

02:22:16.928 --> 02:22:18.190
That is it.

02:22:18.396 --> 02:22:19.385
Okay daughter, then.

02:22:19.931 --> 02:22:22.866
Son, what Geeta says is, everything
shouId be demanded.

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:34.808
Kutta!

02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:38.041
Everything around us is changing.

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:40.407
Perishes and again reborn.

02:22:40.618 --> 02:22:45.555
So, the tides of that change wiII it
not create rippIes in us aIso?

02:23:45.450 --> 02:23:46.576
This is what this city is.

02:23:46.918 --> 02:23:50.149
On one side, there is a foreign
girI in search of our cuIture.

02:23:51.489 --> 02:23:52.421
On the other side.

02:23:52.557 --> 02:23:54.923
My mother in search of modernism.

02:24:00.598 --> 02:24:01.656
Is aII this made by aunty?

02:24:02.033 --> 02:24:03.364
Prepared for daughter onIy.

02:24:09.641 --> 02:24:11.233
UncIe what wouId you pray?

02:24:14.379 --> 02:24:15.539
For aII our things.

02:24:15.947 --> 02:24:20.043
For everyone goodness shouId
prevaiI and our sins be pardoned.

02:24:20.585 --> 02:24:22.416
OnIy good shouId happen to Divya.

02:24:25.723 --> 02:24:27.918
If I do a mistake without knowing..

02:24:29.594 --> 02:24:31.528
If there is guiIt feeIing for
the one who did mistake...

02:24:37.301 --> 02:24:38.359
Like me..

02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:41.568
If it were another friend of Natasha?

02:24:41.773 --> 02:24:42.569
Who?

02:24:44.776 --> 02:24:45.401
Shiva!

02:24:47.445 --> 02:24:49.037
Do you know who he is?

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:52.579
He is the one who kiIIed my Naty.

02:25:04.595 --> 02:25:06.085
I know.

02:25:06.431 --> 02:25:08.524
Natasha, was everything to you.

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:11.534
But for Shiva aIso it was Iike that.

02:25:12.704 --> 02:25:14.228
Did he teII aII these stories?

02:25:17.442 --> 02:25:19.000
He cheated my daughter.

02:25:19.143 --> 02:25:20.201
Cheated her!

02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:25.146
Afterforgetting everything he might
be Iiving happiIy after marrying.

02:25:57.782 --> 02:26:00.444
We must go and
meet Natasha's parents.

02:26:03.654 --> 02:26:05.121
Divya, I can't.

02:26:08.326 --> 02:26:11.454
For Natasha, don't we have
to do at Ieast that much?

02:27:11.422 --> 02:27:13.617
Natasha, was
pIanning to come back.

02:27:18.229 --> 02:27:19.696

02:27:31.609 --> 02:27:33.099
Without me...

02:27:34.812 --> 02:27:37.110
Papa and Mummy can't do anything.

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:38.270
Used to say.

02:30:08.299 --> 02:30:09.823
Hey! It's been very Iong.

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:13.860
I was busy with the
practice of the race and aII.

02:30:15.006 --> 02:30:17.531
How are the things going?

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:22.002
I caIIed to say about the race.

02:30:22.413 --> 02:30:23.880
My main event is on 27th.

02:30:24.548 --> 02:30:27.381
If Sarah is coming,
I'II arrange the tickets.

02:30:27.952 --> 02:30:29.385
27th is it not?

02:30:31.689 --> 02:30:33.987

02:30:42.867 --> 02:30:45.893

02:31:19.503 --> 02:31:21.471
I'm not at aII Iiking to

02:31:21.639 --> 02:31:23.903

Now, we peopIe are aII in America

02:31:33.818 --> 02:31:35.513
Mother's fIight is at night
today, is it not?

02:31:35.686 --> 02:31:38.052
I don't think I'II be abIe
to marry before that.

02:31:39.523 --> 02:31:40.956
SimpIy some fooIish attires.

02:31:41.692 --> 02:31:44.855

02:31:48.966 --> 02:31:50.092
Time for check in.

02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:51.968
Got the seat near the window.

02:31:52.203 --> 02:31:54.467

02:34:37.901 --> 02:34:39.163

02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:41.663
When that boy comes and

02:34:41.872 --> 02:34:43.772
Don't you know that

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:45.336

02:34:45.709 --> 02:34:46.107
And then are you..?

02:34:46.210 --> 02:34:47.234
...being so irresponsibIe?

02:34:47.378 --> 02:34:48.106
But Mama...

02:34:48.312 --> 02:34:50.007
...everything in my Iife

02:34:51.282 --> 02:34:52.544

02:34:52.983 --> 02:34:53.779
Must Ieave India.

02:34:57.354 --> 02:34:59.618
Mama, with this one evening
nothing is going to change.

02:35:30.888 --> 02:35:32.082

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:33.378
This is my Kunju!

02:35:34.124 --> 02:35:35.182
That is my Kuttan.

02:35:35.392 --> 02:35:37.986
In the worId of Aju, where
there is Divya and me...

02:35:38.162 --> 02:35:39.857
...he brought Sarah overthere.

02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:40.860
Is it?

02:35:42.199 --> 02:35:43.894
On that day what we saw there is...

02:35:44.301 --> 02:35:46.166
...answers to Aju's questions.

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:48.963
The reasons for
many of his changes.

02:35:50.207 --> 02:35:52.004
Sarah!

02:36:04.088 --> 02:36:05.885
Where are we going?

02:36:07.257 --> 02:36:08.815
That is aII there.

02:36:38.689 --> 02:36:40.714
If I wouIdn't have come today?

02:36:44.395 --> 02:36:47.387
If you wouIdn't have
come, wouIdn't have seen.

02:36:52.369 --> 02:36:53.768
Then..

02:36:56.373 --> 02:36:58.807
On doing aII this, there
is nothing in Arjun's mind?

02:37:03.414 --> 02:37:04.972
That's better, no.

02:37:20.164 --> 02:37:21.461
Sarah!

02:37:24.535 --> 02:37:25.900
I need to pack.

02:38:08.245 --> 02:38:10.270
The race is tomorrow is it?

02:38:28.332 --> 02:38:32.200
Arjun, It's not my
responsibiIity to care you.

02:38:32.369 --> 02:38:34.394
I can't get defamed Iike this.

02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:36.539
Didn't I say I don't want chiIdren?

02:38:37.274 --> 02:38:38.571
Don't bIame me!

02:38:38.942 --> 02:38:40.534
For everything, she is IittIe different.

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:44.211
Less than that nothing
wiII suit my daughter.

02:39:32.896 --> 02:39:34.193
BiIaI, is everything set?

02:39:34.364 --> 02:39:35.126
Bhai, everything is set.

02:39:35.299 --> 02:39:36.095

02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:36.959
Where Bhai?

02:39:37.134 --> 02:39:38.533
Overthere, that is where his pit is.

02:39:48.512 --> 02:39:49.570
Das!

02:39:52.916 --> 02:39:54.076
Shiva!

02:39:57.554 --> 02:39:59.454

02:40:01.058 --> 02:40:01.888
Where were you man?

02:40:02.059 --> 02:40:02.889

02:40:04.394 --> 02:40:05.292
Where is Arjun?

02:40:05.462 --> 02:40:06.190
Arjun is overthere.

02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:07.324
Come.

02:40:12.402 --> 02:40:13.266
Aju!

02:40:22.946 --> 02:40:24.243
Let us go to the stands.

02:40:24.414 --> 02:40:25.472
Let him reIax.

02:40:26.249 --> 02:40:27.682
Okay man, aII the best.

02:40:30.187 --> 02:40:31.586
Today, is Farhan there for the race?

02:40:31.955 --> 02:40:34.287
At Ieast today that feIIow

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:18.270
What is it Aju?

02:45:18.475 --> 02:45:19.601

02:45:32.355 --> 02:45:32.787

02:45:35.292 --> 02:45:37.726
Brother Das, either me or

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:38.961

02:45:52.642 --> 02:45:53.506
Look!

02:46:34.818 --> 02:46:35.944
Don't you want to go?

02:46:38.855 --> 02:46:39.879
No need to go.

02:46:42.792 --> 02:46:43.918
You are Sarah's Mama right?

02:46:44.594 --> 02:46:45.356

02:46:45.695 --> 02:46:46.491
I'm Shiva Das.

02:46:46.663 --> 02:46:47.595
We are Arjun's famiIy.

02:46:49.733 --> 02:46:50.529
Arjun's cousin.

02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:50.961

02:46:52.402 --> 02:46:53.300
Arjun's cousin.

02:46:53.436 --> 02:46:54.630
They are aII Arjun's friends.

02:46:55.472 --> 02:46:55.995
Like that...

02:46:56.373 --> 02:46:59.467
...the story started with
Divya, Aju, me.

02:47:00.076 --> 02:47:01.873

''By appIying the coIIyrium
in the eyes''

02:47:29.072 --> 02:47:34.533
