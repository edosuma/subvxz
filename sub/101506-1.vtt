00:48.032 --> 00:49.491

00:49.575 --> 00:52.286
- She doesn't.
- No, she really, really does.

00:52.369 --> 00:53.621

Call me from the road.

00:59.335 --> 01:01.503
Okay, it's a three-hour drive

We're gonna be okay.
I'll see you soon.

01:04.047 --> 01:06.175

a piece of that pie, hon.

04:15.447 --> 04:17.072
- Surprise.
- What are you doin'?

04:17.156 --> 04:19.410
You leave for college tomorrow
and I wanted to give you

04:19.493 --> 04:21.536
a night to remember.

04:22.746 --> 04:23.956

Cool. I just...

04:29.003 --> 04:30.462
I thought you didn't want to.

04:30.546 --> 04:32.881
Oh, of course I want to.

04:32.965 --> 04:35.175
- I just want it to be special.

- Right. Yeah.

04:37.386 --> 04:40.055
I love you

04:40.139 --> 04:42.224
Oh, that's... That's so nice.

04:42.308 --> 04:44.018
- That is a Christmas card.
- That's what I said.

04:44.101 --> 04:47.396
- I'm gonna take a picture.
- My parents would love to see his face.

04:47.896 --> 04:48.981
You wanna do the thing?

04:49.398 --> 04:50.983
Guess what I'm wearing under my coat.

04:51.066 --> 04:53.611
Oh, I'm so ready. I'm so ready.

04:54.236 --> 04:56.238
Oh, my... Oh, what... Uh...

04:56.322 --> 04:57.448
That's not what I wanted.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.824
Wow, what a beautiful pie.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.242
<i>- Hi.
- Hello.</i>

05:00.326 --> 05:01.410
Who the hell is it?

05:01.493 --> 05:02.786
<i>It's me, Daddy.</i>

05:02.870 --> 05:05.914
- You're on a video chat. Yeah.
- It's a video chat.

05:05.998 --> 05:07.833
What're you doing on TV?

05:07.916 --> 05:09.543
- Maybe you need, like, a doctor?
- No. No.

05:09.627 --> 05:11.253
- Need some ointment or something... Oh.
- Shut up.

05:11.337 --> 05:13.422
Let's go upstairs
and see your grandson, huh?

05:13.505 --> 05:16.008
- We made this pie for him.
- Yeah. It's really hot.

05:16.091 --> 05:17.301
She did
such a good job.

05:17.384 --> 05:18.719
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm right here.</i>

05:18.802 --> 05:20.888
<i>No, not you.
I'm talking to them.</i>

05:20.971 --> 05:22.973
We're going upstairs, Mom.

05:23.057 --> 05:25.267
And Jason's gonna be surprised.

05:26.018 --> 05:28.020
- Just wait.
- Just wait.

05:28.103 --> 05:31.231
<i>- Who's Jason?
- Jason's your grandson, honey.</i>

05:31.315 --> 05:33.275
<i>What channel is this?</i>

05:33.901 --> 05:34.902
Hmm.

05:34.985 --> 05:36.570
Oh! What is that?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.782
{\an8}What?

05:43.243 --> 05:44.745
Uh-huh. Sure. Okay. Yeah.

05:47.498 --> 05:48.791
Honey.

05:48.874 --> 05:50.709
We have a surprise for you.

05:53.045 --> 05:54.922
- Jason?
- Jason.

05:55.005 --> 05:59.927
<i>Girl's got a prophylactic
in her mouth.</i>

06:01.470 --> 06:03.013
Hold on, Mom. I'm not dressed.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.892
Are you choking on the...

06:06.976 --> 06:08.894
Jason Sawyer, open this door!

06:08.978 --> 06:11.855
Sorry, Mom,
I got a charley horse in my leg.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.148
Can you bring me the banana

06:13.232 --> 06:14.608
for the potassium?

06:17.111 --> 06:18.195
Okay.

06:18.279 --> 06:19.655
I love you very much.

06:19.738 --> 06:21.156
But, uh, you gotta go.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.241
Okay. Bye.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.793
- Jason Sawyer!
- Sorry, Mom.

06:32.876 --> 06:34.753
That damned charley horse.

06:35.796 --> 06:40.676
Meemaw and Peepaw saw your penis.

07:04.033 --> 07:05.784
No. Not yet. Ow!

07:06.118 --> 07:07.620
You're so smart and gorgeous.

07:07.703 --> 07:09.622
- Now?
- Not yet. I'll tell you when.

07:09.705 --> 07:10.706
Just a little higher.

07:10.789 --> 07:13.250
- You're my princess.
- Rub softer but faster.

07:13.334 --> 07:15.461
Smash that pussy now! Now!

07:15.544 --> 07:17.630
I cherish you. I cherish you.

07:26.347 --> 07:28.098
- Fuck yeah.
- Yeah.

07:28.182 --> 07:31.477
We are the greatest couple ever.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.937
No one has sex like we do.

07:34.021 --> 07:39.276
I mean, I've never had sex like this,
but you're my first, so I don't know.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.361
Hey.

07:40.444 --> 07:44.114
I showed you that you're in my
lobster poems I wrote about you, right?

07:44.198 --> 07:47.409
Yeah, but, like, how amazing?

07:47.493 --> 07:49.870
Like, oh, I don't know...

07:49.954 --> 07:51.830
Better than the other girls?

07:53.165 --> 07:55.084
You're doing it again.

07:55.751 --> 07:58.253
I'm not jealous. I'm just asking.

07:58.337 --> 08:02.216
Yeah. It starts with asking
and then you spiral.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.554
Are you filming us?

08:08.681 --> 08:11.183
You little shit!
That is a total violation.

08:11.266 --> 08:12.309
Not cool, Keenan.

08:12.393 --> 08:17.147
You respect my boundaries,
you little shit!

08:17.231 --> 08:21.986
Get back here! Give me that phone!

08:22.069 --> 08:25.447
You will learn
about emotional intelligence.

08:26.448 --> 08:30.452
Delete that video!
The framing isn't even good!

08:33.621 --> 08:35.707
Again? Really?

08:36.582 --> 08:40.379
- Kayla!
- Oops. Sorry. Love you.

08:40.462 --> 08:42.172
Who the fuck is Monica?

08:45.259 --> 08:48.262
<i>I do not shrink
from this responsibility.</i>

08:48.345 --> 08:49.596
<i>I welcome it.</i>

08:52.474 --> 08:55.269
<i>I do not believe that any of us...</i>

08:56.687 --> 08:59.982
<i>The energy, the faith, the devotion...</i>

09:00.065 --> 09:02.276
<i>- Here we go.
- ...which we bring to this endeavor...</i>

09:02.359 --> 09:04.737
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- ...will light our country and all...</i>

09:04.820 --> 09:06.071
Bring it home now.

09:06.155 --> 09:10.576
<i>{\an8}And the glow from that fire
can truly light the world.</i>

09:10.659 --> 09:12.578
<i>And so, my fellow Americans,</i>

09:12.661 --> 09:16.790
<i>ask not what your country
can do for you...</i>

09:17.958 --> 09:20.586
<i>...ask what you can do for your country.</i>

09:20.669 --> 09:23.756
<i>You can ring my bell</i>

09:23.839 --> 09:26.008
<i>Ring my bell</i>

09:27.301 --> 09:29.470
<i>You can ring my bell</i>

09:33.432 --> 09:35.851
- Principal Shankman.
- Stephanie.

09:36.977 --> 09:37.978
Whoo!

09:38.062 --> 09:39.938
Been waitin' for you.

09:40.773 --> 09:42.191
That outfit's amazing.

09:42.274 --> 09:45.277
I'm glad you reconsidered,
decided to take me up on my offer.

09:45.361 --> 09:47.696
- Strip, slave.
- Kinky.

09:48.113 --> 09:50.032
- You like that?
- I like it. I like it.

09:50.115 --> 09:52.117
- Are you excited?
- Oh, yes, Mistress.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.328
- Handcuffs.
- Handcuffs, yeah.

09:55.621 --> 09:57.706
- Is that a whip?
- Yes, it is.

10:02.252 --> 10:03.921
- See, it's an app.
- Oh.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.965
- It's for S and M freaks like you.
- I like it.

10:06.048 --> 10:07.049
I don't really understand it but...

10:07.132 --> 10:08.592
Yeah, 'cause you're fucking stupid.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.469
You know, can you do
the mommy thing again?

10:10.552 --> 10:12.596
The kids at school are gonna love that.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.098
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Are you filming me?

10:14.181 --> 10:17.184
Fuck, yeah. See, I've had it with you,
Principal Shankman,

10:17.267 --> 10:19.853
hitting on me and the other girls.
It's gross.

10:19.937 --> 10:22.898
And I really don't want your pervy,
sexual harassing ass around

10:22.982 --> 10:24.149
for my senior year, so...

10:24.483 --> 10:26.151
Welcome to your retirement party.

10:26.235 --> 10:27.778
Young lady, take the handcuffs off.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.280
Oh, no, no, no.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.740
See, I'm in charge now,
you creepy fuck.

10:31.824 --> 10:33.701
Retire or this video goes viral.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.453
So, take the weekend,
think about what you've done.

10:36.537 --> 10:39.248
And I hope this teaches you
a very valuable lesson.

10:40.249 --> 10:43.168
Never, ever fuck with a Stifler.

10:47.423 --> 10:48.632
- Stephanie!
- Bye!

10:48.716 --> 10:51.093
Stifler! Stifler!

10:52.052 --> 10:53.178
You're in big trouble.

10:54.346 --> 10:55.347
I'm in bigger trouble.

10:55.931 --> 10:57.599
Are you
fucking kidding me?

10:57.683 --> 11:00.894
You choked on a blowjob condom
and you don't even get slammed?

11:00.978 --> 11:02.771
It's called a dental dam.

11:02.855 --> 11:04.023
Why does no one know this?

11:04.106 --> 11:06.275
Okay. So you use
a dental dam for safety,

11:06.358 --> 11:09.320
but you still fell out of a window
and you did not get laid.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.113
Yeah, I get it. I messed up.

11:11.196 --> 11:12.990
I'm sorry if I wanted my first time

11:13.073 --> 11:15.409
to be both safe and beautiful, okay?

11:15.492 --> 11:17.494
- Come on.
- Sex isn't supposed to be beautiful.

11:17.578 --> 11:20.372
It's supposed to be hot
and dirty and hungry!

11:20.456 --> 11:22.625
I am going to do it
and it is going to be beautiful, okay.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.501
Tough love time, Annie.
Your boyfriend's a total bro-bag.

11:24.585 --> 11:26.503
- Yeah.
- Jason is not a bro-bag.

11:26.587 --> 11:29.340
I didn't wanna say it,
but he is the basic of all bros.

11:29.423 --> 11:30.424
- I'm sorry.
- Guys!

11:30.507 --> 11:33.093
We're supposed to be having fun
and fuckin' celebrating our youth!

11:33.177 --> 11:35.471
Senior year, bitches!

11:38.307 --> 11:40.434
Back to school party!

11:53.072 --> 11:55.449
Students of East Great Falls!

11:55.532 --> 11:58.285
Welcome to the annual
Back To School Party!

12:02.373 --> 12:06.418
And on Monday we go back to the bullshit
banality of high school life.

12:06.502 --> 12:08.170
But today, the sun is out!

12:08.253 --> 12:10.047
The booze is flowing!

12:10.130 --> 12:13.926
And we're teenagers
prone to bad decisions!

12:14.468 --> 12:16.470
Yeah!

12:27.898 --> 12:29.733
Ah! Drink it down!

12:32.987 --> 12:34.238
East Great Falls!

12:37.616 --> 12:39.451
Hey, girl.

12:41.662 --> 12:42.997
What's good, Stifler?

12:44.623 --> 12:45.708
Brett McCormick.

12:45.791 --> 12:47.668
At a party and still conscious.
Good for you.

12:47.751 --> 12:49.044
You know, Stifler, I hear things.

12:49.128 --> 12:51.797
You've got the reputation
of being the bang of the century.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.799
Feels like I'm missing out.

12:53.882 --> 12:55.676
You know, that's a real
panty-dropper, McCormick.

12:55.759 --> 12:57.052
I'll tell you what.

12:57.136 --> 12:59.221
Not today. Not tomorrow.

12:59.305 --> 13:00.514
Not if you were the last man on Earth.

13:00.597 --> 13:02.850
Not if I even loved
the reek of Axe body spray.

13:02.933 --> 13:05.185
Not if I didn't already know
you have a itty-bitty little dick.

13:05.269 --> 13:06.854
- That's not...
- No, see, I hear things, too.

13:06.937 --> 13:09.606
So don't try to be clever.
That would just be really bad for you.

13:09.690 --> 13:12.276
Just don't throw up anywhere
or do any nonconsensual groping.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.652
That's your job for today.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.195
I believe in you.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.075
They're my feelings.

13:20.159 --> 13:22.286
You're being ridiculous! Okay?

13:23.245 --> 13:24.455
You hacked my phone.

13:24.538 --> 13:27.583
Okay, so I hacked my boyfriend's phone.

13:27.666 --> 13:29.501
Everybody does it, by the way.

13:29.585 --> 13:31.462
Am I right, ladies? Yes, okay?

13:31.545 --> 13:33.839
And I see some thirsty bitch
hitting on you.

13:34.256 --> 13:37.217
For the last time,
that thirsty bitch is my cousin.

13:37.301 --> 13:39.219
Are you telling me
people don't fuck their cousins?

13:39.303 --> 13:42.264
Because it happens.
Their kids have tails.

13:42.348 --> 13:44.808
And she asked if
you've been working out?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.894
Because she's my physical therapist.

13:46.977 --> 13:48.729
She helped me
when I blew out my knee last year.

13:48.812 --> 13:50.648
Wait. I vaguely remember this.

13:50.731 --> 13:54.151
Yeah, and you texted her
and you told her I have an STD!

13:54.234 --> 13:56.070
Yeah, I wanted her
to stay away from you.

13:56.153 --> 13:59.573
Yeah, well, she called my mom
and now my mom thinks I have syphilis.

13:59.657 --> 14:01.700
Well, she's gonna
be so relieved

14:01.784 --> 14:04.078
when she finds out you don't. Okay?

14:04.161 --> 14:06.330
You know, that can lead to
madness if not treated.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.414
Kayla!

14:07.498 --> 14:08.582
I'm breaking up with you.

14:09.291 --> 14:11.752
Tim. I love you.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.257
Is this a joke?

14:17.341 --> 14:19.468
We're in love, stupid!

14:19.551 --> 14:22.262
Hey, sweetie. You... You okay?

14:22.346 --> 14:23.472
Oh, that?

14:23.555 --> 14:26.475
Yeah. We just break up
so that we can make up.

14:26.558 --> 14:28.018
Yeah, it's just a little speed bump.

14:28.102 --> 14:29.895
Oh! You guys wanna go get fucked up?

14:29.979 --> 14:31.063
Let's go.

14:31.146 --> 14:33.565
- Oh.
- Okay. Whatever you want.

14:33.649 --> 14:35.150
That's concerning.

14:35.234 --> 14:36.318
Tequila!

14:40.197 --> 14:41.991
<i>- Hey, hey!
- Hey!</i>

14:42.074 --> 14:43.575
<i>Annie, what's... What's up?</i>

14:43.659 --> 14:47.538
I'm at this stupid party
and I was just missing you.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.665
Oh, okay.

14:49.915 --> 14:50.958
<i>That's good.</i>

14:51.041 --> 14:52.626
That's real good.

14:53.002 --> 14:55.421
In my mouth next time. Okay.

14:56.839 --> 14:57.840
Whoa!

14:57.923 --> 15:00.009
<i>I gotta go. I'll talk to you later.</i>

15:00.092 --> 15:01.844
Oh, okay. Well, I love...

15:03.304 --> 15:04.305
You.

15:05.723 --> 15:07.099
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm there.

15:11.103 --> 15:12.938
Oh, you might wanna... Okay.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.191
How we doin'?

15:16.275 --> 15:19.695
My sex-starved boyfriend
is surrounded by a bunch of college thots,

15:19.778 --> 15:22.698
and I'm the only 17-year-old
virgin in history!

15:22.781 --> 15:23.949
You are the lucky one.

15:24.033 --> 15:26.827
Ignorance is bliss,
my virginal friend.

15:26.910 --> 15:29.204
It could be days before
Tim and I are back together.

15:29.288 --> 15:31.540
None of us need a man
to have a healthy sex life.

15:31.624 --> 15:36.378
I am learning that technology has given us
incredible innovations in self-pleasure.

15:36.462 --> 15:39.089
And, like, whatever you're into.
External, internal,

15:39.173 --> 15:43.552
dildos, rabbits, wands, vibrators,
remote-controlled butt plugs, anal beads,

15:43.636 --> 15:45.220
- Ben Wa balls...
- Ben Wa balls?

15:45.304 --> 15:49.725
Oh, yeah. I have two in right now.
It is a very specific sensation.

15:49.808 --> 15:51.685
Ooh! Yeah.

15:54.188 --> 15:55.230
They're amazing.

15:55.314 --> 15:57.816
The knowledge that you have
something in your vagina

15:57.900 --> 15:59.109
is very unsettling to me.

15:59.193 --> 16:00.402
That is my whole point.

16:00.486 --> 16:02.863
I would argue that you could use
some unsettling experimentation, Annie.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.157
Do you have a toy?

16:05.240 --> 16:06.325
We don't...

16:06.617 --> 16:07.785
I don't do that.

16:07.868 --> 16:10.204
Why does she hate you?

16:10.496 --> 16:13.290
Guys, we're all lacking
something in the romance area.

16:13.374 --> 16:16.669
But I feel like, we gotta figure
this shit out. Like, it's our senior year.

16:17.211 --> 16:18.295
What do you mean?

16:18.712 --> 16:21.215
- Goal-setting.
- Okay, but what goals?

16:21.298 --> 16:24.760
Oh. For you, you need a guy
who appreciates your sense of humor

16:24.843 --> 16:26.345
and doesn't take things so personally.

16:26.428 --> 16:29.765
Maybe someone who's less emotional.

16:29.848 --> 16:31.183
Yeah, like, someone, like, way less woke.

16:31.266 --> 16:32.559
Not a guy who wants
to make sweet love.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.103
You need a guy who wants
to fuck, you know?

16:34.645 --> 16:35.813
Oh, my God!

16:35.896 --> 16:38.315
- I do need someone who wants to fuck!
- There you go.

16:38.399 --> 16:39.984
Okay, my turn, my turn. Do me.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.444
Oh. Yeah, that's pretty simple.
You need someone smart.

16:42.528 --> 16:43.946
Yeah, you need someone
who understands you,

16:44.029 --> 16:47.157
who would like social consciousness,
but also like integrity.

16:47.241 --> 16:48.659
Mmm. Yeah, like, someone a little kinky.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.120
I like it. Okay. What about Steph?

16:51.704 --> 16:54.248
Me? Oh, I am so good.

16:54.331 --> 16:57.418
Oh, sweetie, sorry,
but you need some serious work.

16:57.501 --> 16:59.086
What? Excuse me?

16:59.169 --> 17:01.588
- What exactly do I need?
- Annie, take it.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.382
- A nice guy.
- Mmm.

17:03.465 --> 17:07.803
Someone who wants to be around you
and buys thoughtful presents

17:07.886 --> 17:09.637
and asks about your day.

17:16.394 --> 17:18.354
Okay. What about Annie?

17:18.896 --> 17:20.983
Um, to have sex with the man I love.

17:21.065 --> 17:23.109
Guys, these goals are totally attainable.

17:23.192 --> 17:24.862
- But we need a deadline.
- Homecoming.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.696
About a month away,
and it has the perfect theme.

17:26.780 --> 17:27.823
Theme?

17:27.906 --> 17:30.034
Your lack of school spirit
is truly disheartening.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.952
Ladies, come on. It's a MORP dance.

17:32.036 --> 17:33.078
"Prom" spelled backwards.

17:33.162 --> 17:35.706
We switch all the conventions,
and most importantly,

17:35.789 --> 17:36.874
- girls ask guys.
- Okay.

17:36.957 --> 17:40.586
Rule one, set a goal
to fix our romantic lives.

17:40.669 --> 17:43.005
Rule number two,
we support our fellow women.

17:43.088 --> 17:46.091
Three, we are all
accountability partners.

17:46.175 --> 17:48.010
And we won't let each other
get away with our usual shit.

17:48.093 --> 17:49.094
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes.

17:49.178 --> 17:51.889
- And rule four, deadline is homecoming.
- Mmm.

17:51.972 --> 17:53.182
- The MORP dance.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:53.265 --> 17:55.517
Wait, but I don't like that it's rules.

17:55.601 --> 17:56.769
Makes it sound like a competition.

17:56.852 --> 17:58.145
Well, everything is a competition.

17:58.771 --> 18:00.481
It's not, though. It's a pact, so...

18:00.564 --> 18:01.815
Ooh, a pact. Okay.

18:01.899 --> 18:05.194
Well, ladies, please raise your glasses
to The Girls' Rules.

18:05.277 --> 18:06.862
- Yes!
- Cheers.

18:07.404 --> 18:08.948
<i>{\an8}We have a pact!</i>

18:10.240 --> 18:11.575
<i>Call it classic
Reach out and grab it</i>

18:11.659 --> 18:13.619
<i>Super massive
Pulls like a magnet</i>

18:15.788 --> 18:19.375
<i>{\an8}Jumping straight out the box
You got me like whoa</i>

18:20.918 --> 18:23.837
<i>Well, hello
Got, got, got me like whoa</i>

18:24.755 --> 18:28.133
<i>Well, hello
Got, got, got me like whoa</i>

18:28.634 --> 18:29.635
<i>Well, hello</i>

18:34.181 --> 18:35.557
Okay, we start today.

18:35.641 --> 18:37.601
We're getting what we want,
and if anybody doesn't like it,

18:37.685 --> 18:38.978
they can eat a bag of dicks.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.023
Kind of feel like we're Charlie's Angels,
but not the Drew Barrymore one.

18:43.107 --> 18:45.025
The older one where no one wore bras.

18:45.109 --> 18:46.110
Nice.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.155
<i>I'm attracted
I gotta have it</i>

18:50.239 --> 18:52.449
<i>Super massive
Pulls like a magnet</i>

18:53.534 --> 18:56.328
Not to ruin this badass moment
of female empowerment,

18:56.412 --> 19:00.165
but look at our choices.

19:01.292 --> 19:03.711
You're right.
We've known these rats since elementary.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.504
You really think
we go to school with the perfect guy

19:05.587 --> 19:06.588
and just haven't noticed?

19:06.672 --> 19:07.798
Oh, I think exactly that.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.633
Look, there's over 500 guys
at East Great Falls.

19:09.717 --> 19:12.594
The guy you might be looking for
might be right under your oyster.

19:12.678 --> 19:13.762
Or at Michigan State.

19:13.846 --> 19:15.848
Okay, ironically,
I think that Annie out of all of us

19:15.931 --> 19:17.558
will probably benefit
the most from our pact.

19:17.641 --> 19:19.059
- Yeah?
- Especially the part

19:19.143 --> 19:20.894
- where we call on her bullshit.
- What bullshit?

19:20.978 --> 19:23.480
Okay. You wanna lose it
to Jason the D-bag?

19:23.564 --> 19:24.648
Here's an idea.

19:24.732 --> 19:26.942
Get your ass down to Michigan State
and fuck his little brains out.

19:27.484 --> 19:29.236
Seems simple, yet here you are.

19:31.488 --> 19:32.489
That was harsh.

19:32.573 --> 19:34.742
Yeah, rule three,
accountability partner!

19:34.825 --> 19:35.993
Jason's busy.

19:36.076 --> 19:37.369
I'm trying to plan a trip there,

19:37.453 --> 19:40.122
but with his school schedule,
we barely even get time to talk.

19:40.205 --> 19:41.624
- Yeah.
- So sad.

19:42.625 --> 19:43.876
Oh.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.044
<i>AdiÃ³s, mofos.</i>

19:47.379 --> 19:49.465
In the meantime,
I suggest we start training.

19:49.548 --> 19:52.259
In order to enjoy sex,
you need to know what you like, right?

19:52.343 --> 19:53.844
What're you thinking?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.388
I'm thinking that
we do a shopping trip.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.016
Oh, gotta go. Gonna be late.

20:01.894 --> 20:02.895
Whoa.

20:03.812 --> 20:05.397
Shit. Shit. Shit.

20:07.191 --> 20:13.405
<i>You can ring my bell
Ring my bell...</i>

20:24.375 --> 20:25.751
Oh.

20:27.086 --> 20:28.253
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

20:28.337 --> 20:31.423
Are you okay? That looked really painful.

20:31.548 --> 20:34.385
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
No, I'm great. I, um... I just...

20:34.468 --> 20:36.387
I was late for class.
It's a little schedule blunder.

20:36.470 --> 20:38.097
It's a pre-calc.
It should've said calc calc.

20:38.180 --> 20:39.264
Hence, the running.

20:39.348 --> 20:42.226
But you look lost,
and as Student Council Vice President,

20:42.309 --> 20:43.644
it's actually my obligation to help you.

20:43.727 --> 20:45.437
Hi. I'm Michelle.

20:46.605 --> 20:49.108
And I'm trying really hard
to hide my growing anxiety

20:49.191 --> 20:51.235
about being late for class.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.112
I'm Grant. Just moved here.

20:53.195 --> 20:54.738
Totally lost.

20:54.822 --> 20:57.074
And amused at your growing anxiety.

20:57.157 --> 20:58.200
But you're in luck.

20:58.284 --> 20:59.743
I am also on the way to calculus.

20:59.827 --> 21:02.413
I'd be more than happy
to report how you selflessly helped me,

21:02.496 --> 21:03.789
even though it made you late.

21:03.872 --> 21:06.709
And I'll be sure to leave out
the part about you, you know,

21:06.792 --> 21:07.960
face-slamming a door.

21:13.799 --> 21:14.925
Is that a Ben Wa ball?

21:15.592 --> 21:16.885
Yeah.

21:19.722 --> 21:21.765
- Three second rule.
- Okay.

21:21.849 --> 21:23.642
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

21:26.061 --> 21:29.231
A sweet treat for my sweet treat.

21:29.690 --> 21:32.109
What're you doing?
We broke up. Remember?

21:32.192 --> 21:34.111
We had a little squabble.

21:34.194 --> 21:35.904
Pumpkin spice or mocha?

21:35.988 --> 21:37.698
This is real. It's over.

21:37.781 --> 21:39.867
You're just not my lobster.

21:53.005 --> 21:54.256
Mind if I join you?

21:57.051 --> 22:01.138
Look. I know this is not
in any way my business,

22:01.221 --> 22:03.265
but I couldn't help but overhear.

22:03.349 --> 22:04.808
Oh, God.

22:04.892 --> 22:06.685
Yeah, it's pretty uncomfy.

22:06.769 --> 22:10.439
But I figured it might be a less pathetic
moment if you weren't sitting alone

22:10.522 --> 22:13.525
while your ex is still watching.

22:14.193 --> 22:15.861
You really wanna drive him nuts?

22:15.945 --> 22:17.821
Pass me that delicious pumpkin spice.

22:20.324 --> 22:22.242
- Who are you?
- I'm Grant.

22:22.326 --> 22:23.744
I'm cheering you up.

22:23.827 --> 22:26.956
- You're trying to steal my coffee.
- That's just an added bonus.

22:31.502 --> 22:34.254
- I'm Kayla.
- Nice to meet you, Kayla.

22:34.338 --> 22:35.339
Mmm.

22:38.258 --> 22:39.426
Why'd you give me the mocha one?

22:39.510 --> 22:41.178
You think I'm just gonna
give you pumpkin spice?

22:41.261 --> 22:43.222
This shit is seasonal
and I don't even know you.

22:43.889 --> 22:44.890
TouchÃ©.

22:47.309 --> 22:48.560
<i>Yeah</i>

22:55.567 --> 22:58.612
<i>Let everyone know
That the girls run the show</i>

22:59.863 --> 23:02.408
Who wants some? Yeah!

23:02.491 --> 23:06.036
<i>The lights are down low
Raise the curtain and go</i>

23:06.120 --> 23:08.372
<i>It's our big night
Hey</i>

23:08.455 --> 23:10.332
<i>Our big night
Ho</i>

23:10.416 --> 23:12.209
Who the fuck is that?

23:12.293 --> 23:13.460
Who's the fresh meat?

23:13.544 --> 23:14.712
Yeah, look at that snack.

23:14.795 --> 23:15.963
Nice dick!

23:16.046 --> 23:17.589
You spooked him. Ball!

23:18.257 --> 23:20.217
- No way. He's too far.
- 20 bucks.

23:20.301 --> 23:21.760
- I want some of that.
- You're on.

23:21.844 --> 23:23.095
Go on, give me some space.

23:28.809 --> 23:29.893
Wait for it.

23:32.813 --> 23:34.023
- Fuck, yeah!
- Oh shit!

23:34.106 --> 23:35.566
- I can't believe she actually made that.
- He might be dead.

23:35.649 --> 23:39.278
- You killed the snack!
- Venmo me, motherfuckers!

23:39.361 --> 23:42.823
<i>Girls run this
Girls run this show</i>

23:45.034 --> 23:48.621
Oh, my God, I... I am so sorry.

23:50.205 --> 23:51.457
Are you okay?

23:52.499 --> 23:54.752
Oh, I think so.

23:54.835 --> 23:55.878
Whoa.

23:55.961 --> 23:59.632
- You good?
- Yeah, I think so.

23:59.715 --> 24:02.635
Um, I'm Stephanie. Stephanie Stifler.

24:02.718 --> 24:03.886
I'm Grant.

24:03.969 --> 24:06.472
Uh, your hands are so soft.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:10.184 --> 24:12.394
I'm looking for
the boys' lacrosse practice.

24:12.770 --> 24:13.771
Oh.

24:13.854 --> 24:16.190
The boys' practice is on the east field.

24:16.273 --> 24:18.984
- Yeah, I'll walk you.
- Uh, it's... It's okay.

24:21.654 --> 24:24.073
- Nice goal, by the way.
- It was good, right?

24:27.409 --> 24:28.744
You will be mine.

24:34.792 --> 24:36.377
Come on.

24:36.877 --> 24:38.170
Oh, my God.

24:38.253 --> 24:40.339
I am very uncomfortable right now.

24:40.422 --> 24:43.550
Okay. Annie, let's just
take a deep breath and calm down

24:43.634 --> 24:45.260
and realize that this is just a store.

24:45.344 --> 24:48.222
There's nothing weird or wrong
or dirty about this place.

24:48.305 --> 24:49.932
- You come here a lot?
- Michelle.

24:50.015 --> 24:51.058
- Hey, Rose.
- I guess so.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.310
The new VJ-VAX just came out.

24:53.394 --> 24:56.188
Girl, it's great for your nipples,
your tongue,

24:56.271 --> 24:58.190
your clitoris, any sphincter...

24:58.273 --> 25:00.526
She's naming so many
different body part words.

25:00.609 --> 25:02.027
Poor thing. You're still allowing yourself

25:02.111 --> 25:04.238
- to be clit-blocked by the patriarchy.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:04.321 --> 25:06.865
I'm so sorry.
Did I hear you say the VJ-VAX came in?

25:06.949 --> 25:08.033
I've just heard amazing things.

25:08.117 --> 25:09.201
They're all true.

25:09.285 --> 25:10.661
Oh, can I get a demonstration?

25:12.371 --> 25:14.206
- Okay. Come on.
- Oh, no.

25:17.710 --> 25:18.711
Oh, dear God.

25:18.794 --> 25:20.546
Welcome to
your sexual awakening.

25:20.629 --> 25:22.965
{\an8}Somewhere on this wall
lies the access point to your orgasm.

25:23.048 --> 25:25.634
But, to pick the right toy,
I do need a little bit of information.

25:25.718 --> 25:27.219
Are you an innie or an outie?

25:27.303 --> 25:28.345
Am I what?

25:29.430 --> 25:30.472
Okay.

25:30.556 --> 25:33.684
Why don't we use
this rubber vagina as a visual aid?

25:33.767 --> 25:36.186
- That's a return, but we cleaned it.
- Thanks, Rose.

25:36.270 --> 25:37.604
Okay, do you like this,

25:37.688 --> 25:39.273
- or do you like this?
- A.

25:39.356 --> 25:41.567
I'll... I'll... I'll just pick Option A.

25:41.650 --> 25:43.027
Well, that makes a lot of sense.

25:43.110 --> 25:45.070
Most women orgasm
through clitoral stimulation.

25:45.154 --> 25:46.614
- Okay.
- Actually, did you know that

25:46.697 --> 25:50.534
75% of women never orgasm
through intercourse alone? It's a fact.

25:50.618 --> 25:51.994
I'm sorry, ladies, could you just...

25:52.077 --> 25:53.203
You're blocking the good stuff.

25:53.287 --> 25:54.788
- Oh, sorry.
- Ooh!

25:55.289 --> 25:57.249
How about this guy?

25:57.333 --> 25:59.710
Hello. How are you?

26:00.419 --> 26:02.129
Aw, sweet baby bird.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.964
Let me guess. Is this your first toy?

26:04.048 --> 26:05.799
Yes, it is her first toy.

26:05.883 --> 26:08.510
That is such a special day
in a woman's life.

26:08.844 --> 26:10.471
Oh, sweetheart.

26:10.554 --> 26:12.806
I remember my first
like it was yesterday.

26:12.890 --> 26:14.433
The Muscle Massager 5000.

26:15.017 --> 26:16.477
{\an8}Still a bestseller.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.729
Mmm, that thing was squirt-tastic.

26:19.772 --> 26:23.651
{\an8}But nothing compares
to this gem right here.

26:24.693 --> 26:27.154
Three vibrating stimulators,

26:27.571 --> 26:30.407
curved tip to help you
find that elusive G-spot.

26:30.491 --> 26:32.284
Spoiler alert, it's in the front.

26:32.368 --> 26:34.370
There's a rabbit
for your itty-bitty clitty.

26:34.453 --> 26:36.789
And if you pee a little bit,
don't worry, it's waterproof.

26:36.872 --> 26:39.917
I mean, it is a beautiful time
to be alive, ladies. Am I right?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.126
- Yeah.
- Right.

26:41.210 --> 26:43.671
Wait. Call off the dogs.
The search is off.

26:43.754 --> 26:45.005
I found it.

26:45.547 --> 26:47.925
These black lacy panties are perfect.

26:48.008 --> 26:50.010
They're discreet. They're non-invasive.

26:50.094 --> 26:51.595
I agree. Those are perfect.

26:51.679 --> 26:55.015
And I'm so excited for the journey
that you're about to embark on.

26:55.432 --> 26:58.352
Godspeed, little bird. Godspeed.

27:01.355 --> 27:02.356
Wow.

27:02.439 --> 27:03.941
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

27:04.024 --> 27:06.151
- What? Relax.
- Relax?

27:06.235 --> 27:08.904
That super-weird
but strangely helpful woman

27:08.988 --> 27:11.115
just picked out
a vibrating undergarment for me.

27:11.198 --> 27:12.783
She's not weird. She's a goddess.

27:12.866 --> 27:15.411
And who cares?
You're never gonna see her again.

27:15.494 --> 27:16.745
Let's go.

27:19.206 --> 27:20.207
Oh.

27:20.291 --> 27:22.293
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Dad.

27:22.376 --> 27:24.962
- Big test. Gotta study.
- You have a test already?

27:27.506 --> 27:28.507
Wow.

27:28.632 --> 27:31.468
Must be some kind of
accelerated school.

27:58.579 --> 28:01.498
Oh, my God.

28:06.045 --> 28:07.046
Hi.

28:07.129 --> 28:10.215
Uh, I just moved in next door
and I wanted to introduce myself.

28:10.299 --> 28:14.303
I'm Ellen and...
Oh, come here, hon. This is my son, Grant.

28:14.845 --> 28:15.971
I made you a pie.

28:17.848 --> 28:19.683
- Come in.
- Thank you.

28:19.767 --> 28:22.686
<i>Babe, I... I got...
I gotta get to class.</i>

28:23.145 --> 28:25.898
You don't have time to knock one out?

28:25.981 --> 28:28.609
<i>Are you... Are you saying
you wanna have cybersex?</i>

28:28.692 --> 28:30.819
Because, uh, yeah, that would...

28:30.903 --> 28:32.696
That would... That would be dope.

28:32.780 --> 28:35.950
I bought something for us.

28:36.450 --> 28:39.578
So I just thought I'd make this
for you and your... Your wife.

28:39.662 --> 28:41.205
No wife, sadly. Divorced.

28:41.288 --> 28:43.791
- It's just me and my daughter.
- What a coincidence.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.085
- Me, too.
- Oh.

28:46.293 --> 28:48.504
What do ya say
we dig into this delicious pie?

28:48.587 --> 28:49.588
Apple?

28:49.838 --> 28:50.839
Cherry.

28:50.923 --> 28:51.924
Mmm.

28:52.091 --> 28:53.342
Still hot.

28:54.426 --> 28:56.679
Oh, come on. Oh, you gotta...
You gotta show me.

28:56.762 --> 28:58.305
You gotta show me. Please?

28:58.389 --> 28:59.723
Please.

28:59.807 --> 29:01.141
<i>Okay. Just a peek.</i>

29:02.685 --> 29:04.144
Oh, damn it!

29:04.228 --> 29:06.981
Ugh! Uh, my Wi-Fi sucks.

29:07.064 --> 29:11.277
Okay, all you need to know is
that they're tiny and lacy,

29:11.360 --> 29:14.071
and they have a remote control.

29:15.197 --> 29:17.491
You control your panties with that?

29:17.574 --> 29:21.578
<i>Oh, nice. Oh, you got...
Turn it on. Mmm-hmm.</i>

29:26.750 --> 29:28.460
- Oh, wow.
- Oh.

29:28.669 --> 29:29.962
It's so good.

29:30.045 --> 29:31.755
That is so good.

29:31.839 --> 29:33.841
Mmm.

29:33.924 --> 29:35.384
I'm so glad that you like it.

29:35.884 --> 29:39.221
Oh, I like it. I like it a lot.

29:40.556 --> 29:41.807
Oh, shit.

29:41.890 --> 29:44.143
Oh, I've never heard you cuss before.

29:44.768 --> 29:46.687
I like it. Can you...
Can you cuss again?

29:46.770 --> 29:49.106
Holy fuck.

29:54.486 --> 29:55.529
Mmm.

29:55.613 --> 29:56.614
Hmm.

29:56.697 --> 30:01.076
So, Kevin,
how long have you been divorced?

30:01.160 --> 30:02.244
Long time.

30:04.788 --> 30:07.625
Such a long time.

30:07.708 --> 30:11.086
Okay. You know, this has been great,
but I have a big test tomorrow.

30:11.170 --> 30:12.588
- I gotta go study for it, so...
- Oh.

30:12.671 --> 30:15.758
I bet Annie's studying
for the same test.

30:15.841 --> 30:17.676
Whoo.

30:18.344 --> 30:20.304
Okay. Whoa.

30:20.387 --> 30:22.473
- Oh, shit.
- Fantastic.

30:22.598 --> 30:24.183
You go to East Great Falls?

30:24.266 --> 30:26.977
Actually we both do.
I'm the new principal.

30:27.394 --> 30:28.395
Huh.

30:28.479 --> 30:29.480
No way.

30:29.563 --> 30:30.564
You know what?

30:31.106 --> 30:33.943
Annie loves a surprise.
We should go up and say hi to her.

30:34.026 --> 30:35.611
Holy fuck.

30:35.694 --> 30:36.695
Whoo!

30:36.862 --> 30:37.863
Oh, shit.

30:38.447 --> 30:39.615
Oh, I'm gonna pop.

30:39.698 --> 30:41.116
Hey, honey, you busy?

30:42.159 --> 30:43.827
No! Hey!

30:43.911 --> 30:45.996
- Just... Just chillin'.
- Well, great.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.874
Because I want to
introduce you to your new principal.

30:48.958 --> 30:50.250
This is Miss Fisher.

30:51.794 --> 30:53.545
- Huh.
- Hi.

30:53.629 --> 30:55.130
I'm gonna pop!

30:55.214 --> 30:57.800
<i>Oh, I'm popping! I'm popping!</i>

30:58.300 --> 30:59.510
<i>- Oh, I'm gonna pop.
- It's been giving me trouble all day.</i>

30:59.593 --> 31:01.345
Just noises coming out of there.

31:01.720 --> 31:04.598
You know, funny story.
Annie and I have actually already met.

31:05.140 --> 31:06.642
- At the library.
- Oh, yeah.

31:06.725 --> 31:09.979
<i>I was checking out Moby Dick
and she had a cute little romance novel.</i>

31:10.062 --> 31:11.188
How is that going for you?

31:11.271 --> 31:13.774
It's so good.

31:13.857 --> 31:15.025
- Good to hear.
- Yeah.

31:15.109 --> 31:17.945
You know, I wanna introduce you
to my son, Grant.

31:18.028 --> 31:19.530
Isn't he handsome?

31:19.989 --> 31:21.824
Nice to meet you.

31:22.241 --> 31:25.160
- Oh...
- I'm Grant. Nice to meet you, too.

31:27.079 --> 31:29.164
You guys hear that?
It's like a hum...

31:30.082 --> 31:31.083
Mmm...

31:31.542 --> 31:33.585
No, I'm not... I don't...
I don't hear anything.

31:36.171 --> 31:38.090
Annie. You okay?

31:38.173 --> 31:40.551
- Oh, I'm...
- You know what I think would be good?

31:40.634 --> 31:42.553
I think it would be great
if we went downstairs

31:42.636 --> 31:44.680
- and got Annie a hot piece of pie.
- Oh!

31:44.763 --> 31:46.181
Oh, God, yes!

31:46.265 --> 31:49.935
Great. You know, sometimes a girl
just needs something simple.

31:50.019 --> 31:51.228
Am I right, honey?

31:51.312 --> 31:53.689
Here, why don't you give me a tour?
Let's start with your bedroom.

32:04.867 --> 32:06.201
- It's very high tech.
- Mmm.

32:07.828 --> 32:09.580
- Nice to meet you, Annie.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:10.247 --> 32:11.248
Yeah.

32:18.255 --> 32:21.216
<i>This year's
Homecoming theme is so exciting.</i>

32:21.300 --> 32:26.305
<i>So come as you dream,
because we are having a Pajama Party...</i>

32:26.388 --> 32:27.556
{\an8}MORP! Whoop whoop!

32:27.640 --> 32:29.308
That's "prom" spelled backwards.

32:29.391 --> 32:32.811
<i>Uh, instead of tuxedos and gowns,
put on your PJs and onesies!</i>

32:32.895 --> 32:34.146
<i>That's crazy!</i>

32:34.229 --> 32:37.191
Now, I have the super
important responsibility

32:37.274 --> 32:39.234
of introducing our new leader,

32:39.318 --> 32:41.528
Principal Ellen Fisher.

32:41.862 --> 32:43.781
<i>Aw, thanks, Emmett.</i>

32:43.989 --> 32:44.990
<i>Hello.</i>

32:45.074 --> 32:47.743
<i>I bet you're pretty surprised
to see me here in this position.</i>

32:47.826 --> 32:48.994
<i>- Well, guess what?
- Holy shit.</i>

32:49.078 --> 32:50.120
<i>I'm surprised, too.</i>

32:50.788 --> 32:52.122
It is her. You're right.

32:52.498 --> 32:53.499
I told you.

32:54.458 --> 32:56.377
You said I'd never see her again.

32:56.460 --> 32:57.878
But I did.

32:58.295 --> 33:00.839
An hour later, in my bedroom,

33:00.923 --> 33:03.008
when I was using
a recently-purchased item.

33:04.218 --> 33:06.053
Ew, God. Private conversation.

33:06.136 --> 33:10.724
A strong, accomplished woman
who's very comfortable with her sexuality?

33:11.225 --> 33:13.560
She's, like, the perfect role model.

33:17.314 --> 33:21.735
<i>It seems that Principal Shankman
retired, rather abruptly.</i>

33:21.819 --> 33:25.155
<i>But I know
we all wish him very, very well.</i>

33:25.239 --> 33:28.117
<i>So you guys, have a great day.</i>

33:28.200 --> 33:29.493
Go, Trademakers!

33:29.827 --> 33:31.912
- Uh, trailblazers.
- Trailblazers. I know.

33:31.996 --> 33:33.497
Go, Trailblazers!

33:38.877 --> 33:39.962
Hey, you.

33:40.504 --> 33:43.048
Hi. Kayla, right?

33:46.093 --> 33:47.261
I got your favorite.

33:47.511 --> 33:49.596
Wow! Thank you. Mmm.

33:50.514 --> 33:52.016
It really does taste like fall.

33:54.226 --> 33:56.103
Oh, it so does.

33:56.937 --> 33:57.980
- You're so funny.
- Uh...

33:58.063 --> 34:00.190
I'm just gonna head to class.

34:00.274 --> 34:02.693
Thank you, again, very much.

34:05.362 --> 34:06.363
Mmm.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.409
Hey. Who's that guy?

34:10.992 --> 34:12.494
Who is, uh... Oh!

34:12.869 --> 34:14.913
That guy. That's Grant.

34:15.496 --> 34:16.498
My friend.

34:16.581 --> 34:17.958
My special friend.

34:18.041 --> 34:20.210
We just broke up three days ago.

34:20.293 --> 34:22.838
Tim, are you jealous?

34:22.920 --> 34:25.299
That is so cute.

34:25.382 --> 34:28.052
You know, if you ever wanted me
to drop by...

34:28.510 --> 34:29.510
Uh...

34:29.594 --> 34:31.764
We're not getting back together.

34:31.889 --> 34:32.889
Oh.

34:32.972 --> 34:35.391
Back together?
Who wants that?

34:36.601 --> 34:38.771
No, I'm just talking
about a little ex sex.

34:39.771 --> 34:40.856
Ex sex?

34:40.938 --> 34:43.150
How many times
did we sneak off during lunch

34:43.233 --> 34:44.693
and go do it at your place?

34:44.777 --> 34:46.235
What's a few more?

34:47.320 --> 34:50.074
Oh, I mean,
if you don't want to, I, you know...

34:50.157 --> 34:52.451
I think I have plans
with Grant anyway. So...

34:52.534 --> 34:54.078
Uh, lunchtime.

34:54.744 --> 34:55.746
My place.

35:01.168 --> 35:02.378
So, you guys
getting back together?

35:03.045 --> 35:04.630
That's how a bad bitch does it.

35:09.593 --> 35:11.303
She was holding my spot. Yeah.

35:14.181 --> 35:15.182
Hi.

35:16.141 --> 35:17.309
Remember me?

35:17.393 --> 35:18.978
- No.
- Sure you do.

35:19.061 --> 35:21.981
Yesterday, your room,
you were pleasuring yourself.

35:23.357 --> 35:25.484
Gross, don't say it like that.

35:26.068 --> 35:27.403
Well, how should I say it?

35:27.486 --> 35:29.238
Just don't say it.

35:29.321 --> 35:30.948
Ever. To anyone.

35:31.031 --> 35:34.326
Okay. I won't.
'Cause it's nobody's business.

35:34.410 --> 35:35.661
- Fries, please.
- Right.

35:36.412 --> 35:39.123
You know what, to tell you the truth,
though, I found the whole thing kind of...

35:39.206 --> 35:41.125
I don't know, endearing.

35:43.627 --> 35:44.837
I have a boyfriend.

35:44.920 --> 35:48.465
No, I know. I didn't get to meet him,
but he sounded really nice.

35:48.549 --> 35:50.175
- Eggplant taco?
- Yeah. Please. Thank you.

35:50.259 --> 35:54.513
Look, just because you barged into my room
while I was having a private moment

35:54.596 --> 35:57.975
with the love of my life,
doesn't mean you know me.

35:58.058 --> 35:59.143
I'm sorry.

35:59.226 --> 36:04.023
The "I'm about to pop, I'm popping" guy,
that's the love of your life?

36:06.442 --> 36:09.612
I am in a mature,
committed relationship

36:09.695 --> 36:11.864
and if I told Jason
the things you are saying...

36:11.947 --> 36:14.450
Oh, you wouldn't be too happy, pal.

36:14.533 --> 36:17.369
Okay. Got it. Pal.

36:18.078 --> 36:21.624
Look, I wish you and your Internet lover
a lifetime of happiness.

36:22.666 --> 36:23.667
Enjoy your lunch.

36:24.752 --> 36:26.045
Thank you.

36:31.091 --> 36:32.676
You're good at talking to boys.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.970
How do you start?
I'm having trouble with my opening.

36:36.472 --> 36:38.891
Well, the damsel-in-distress shit
usually works like a charm.

36:39.516 --> 36:42.186
Well, I am not doing that.

36:42.269 --> 36:43.771
Girl, it's amazing how dumb men can get

36:43.854 --> 36:46.190
when they think
we actually need them, so...

36:46.273 --> 36:47.399
Emmett, what up, man?

36:48.567 --> 36:49.777
Hello, sexy.

36:52.029 --> 36:54.031
Okay, why is my wet dream
hugging Emmett?

36:55.574 --> 36:56.575
Wait.

36:57.618 --> 36:59.244
You don't actually like Grant, right?

36:59.328 --> 37:00.704
I mean, he's not your type.

37:00.788 --> 37:03.082
What could you two
possibly have in common?

37:03.165 --> 37:05.250
Undeniable animal magnetism, baby.

37:05.584 --> 37:08.170
Um, I have to go to, uh...
I have a library...

37:08.253 --> 37:09.463
I need to go to the... I have a book.

37:09.546 --> 37:10.714
I gotta... Bye. I'll see you later.

37:10.798 --> 37:12.508
- See ya.
- Text me.

37:12.591 --> 37:14.593
Mmm-hmm.
Damsel in distress.

37:14.677 --> 37:16.303
Damsel in distress. Damsel in distress.

37:16.804 --> 37:18.180
That way.

38:02.099 --> 38:03.267
Oh, shit!

38:07.021 --> 38:08.022
Whoa!

38:08.605 --> 38:09.606
Ah...

38:09.690 --> 38:11.317
You, again.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.484
You okay?

38:14.903 --> 38:15.988
{\an8}Yeah.

38:16.238 --> 38:17.239
Whoa.

38:17.323 --> 38:19.533
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:20.034 --> 38:24.455
I'm just so fragile and delicate.

38:25.164 --> 38:26.165
Okay.

38:26.248 --> 38:27.249
Wow.

38:27.916 --> 38:31.295
Your neck is very muscly.

38:31.378 --> 38:33.005
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:33.088 --> 38:35.758
I think maybe we should
get you some medical attention.

38:35.841 --> 38:37.426
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:40.638 --> 38:41.930
Mind if I join you?

38:42.473 --> 38:43.474
Hey.

38:43.849 --> 38:46.518
What? Uh, no. Why?

38:46.602 --> 38:48.562
Oh, come on.
We don't even talk anymore.

38:48.646 --> 38:50.564
Yeah. Not since fifth grade,

38:50.648 --> 38:53.692
when you told everyone
I wet my pants at recess.

38:54.401 --> 38:55.444
But you did.

38:55.861 --> 38:57.571
No, it was a malfunctioning
water fountain.

38:57.655 --> 38:58.697
Oh, right. Okay.

38:58.781 --> 39:00.532
Look, I'm reading, all right?

39:00.616 --> 39:02.868
And I know this isn't a practice
you're familiar with,

39:02.952 --> 39:04.495
but it's a nonverbal cue

39:04.578 --> 39:07.873
which says I'm enjoying some
solitary time, so, maybe don't bother me.

39:07.957 --> 39:10.876
Okay, well I kind of feel bad about
the whole wetting-the-pants thing, now.

39:11.543 --> 39:12.586
Yeah, you should.

39:15.214 --> 39:17.007
Hey, the guy you were talking to, Grant.

39:17.967 --> 39:19.051
You guys friends?

39:19.301 --> 39:22.763
Uh, we've only been roommates at band camp
the last seven summers,

39:22.846 --> 39:23.847
so, uh, yeah.

39:23.931 --> 39:26.100
- Yeah, we're friends.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Grant's in band?

39:26.183 --> 39:27.184
No shit.

39:27.267 --> 39:29.812
Yeah. He's an incredibly
talented saxophone player.

39:29.895 --> 39:31.188
- Boring.
- No.

39:31.271 --> 39:34.817
Sax is the sexiest wind instrument.
So it's not boring.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.695
Okay. What are his hobbies?
What's he like?

39:37.778 --> 39:40.197
Okay, you haven't
spoken to me in like nine years,

39:40.281 --> 39:43.325
so why don't you
go ask Grant these questions?

39:43.409 --> 39:45.286
Okay, look, Emmett,
I'm kinda turning over a new leaf.

39:45.911 --> 39:49.498
I'm looking to date
a different type, someone nice.

39:49.581 --> 39:51.959
And anyway, my charms of seduction
don't seem to be working on him,

39:52.042 --> 39:54.461
so I was thinking that,
I don't know, you'd help me out.

39:54.545 --> 39:58.090
You want me to help trick
my good friend Grant into liking you?

39:58.465 --> 39:59.508
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

39:59.633 --> 40:00.634
Hmm.

40:00.801 --> 40:03.679
Just so he can be another notch
on your lipstick case?

40:03.762 --> 40:06.473
Okay, news flash.
I don't have a lipstick case.

40:06.557 --> 40:08.684
And neither does anyone
under the age of 80, so...

40:08.767 --> 40:10.644
Look, dude, are you gonna
help me or what?

40:11.061 --> 40:12.813
Well, I foresee
a couple of problems.

40:12.896 --> 40:13.897
What?

40:13.981 --> 40:16.859
Well, Grant, he's got this
whole good taste thing.

40:16.942 --> 40:18.819
Yeah, and then...
And then there's my integrity.

40:18.902 --> 40:23.866
I'm reluctant to help trick
my friend into a romance with a dementor.

40:26.410 --> 40:27.411
What's that?

40:27.494 --> 40:30.122
Dark creatures that
consume human happiness.

40:30.205 --> 40:31.332
<i>It's from Harry Potter.</i>

40:31.415 --> 40:33.584
Wow, you are such a fucking nerd.

40:37.129 --> 40:38.422
Look, I'll give you 20 bucks.

40:40.174 --> 40:42.301
How dare you?
You know, this guy's a friend.

40:42.384 --> 40:44.720
It's $100 minimum.

40:47.931 --> 40:49.141
Better be worth it.

40:50.392 --> 40:52.019
Hey, I think we need a nurse.

40:52.102 --> 40:54.355
Injured student. Code Blue!

40:54.521 --> 40:55.522
Huh?

40:55.606 --> 40:56.607
No...

40:56.690 --> 40:58.525
No, no, no. No Code Blue.
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

40:58.609 --> 40:59.735
Grant, what happened? Are you okay?

40:59.818 --> 41:00.819
I've got this, Principal Fisher.

41:00.903 --> 41:02.196
Grant, put her in this chair, all right?
I'll get her to the nurse.

41:02.279 --> 41:04.365
- Here we go. You're good.
- No, no, no. I...

41:04.448 --> 41:05.741
- Hey, take good care of her.
- Good work.

41:05.824 --> 41:07.076
- But, uh...
- Oh, my God,

41:07.159 --> 41:08.786
your hair smells so beautiful.

41:10.663 --> 41:12.331
Seriously, it's fine.
You don't have to push me.

41:12.414 --> 41:14.667
No, no, no, we're not taking
any chances here, all right?

41:14.750 --> 41:16.460
Not with the Academic
Decathlon captain.

41:16.543 --> 41:18.087
We need you this weekend
against Parkway High.

41:18.170 --> 41:20.798
- You watch the Academic Decathlon?
- Of course.

41:20.881 --> 41:23.300
Are you the guy that's always
holding up signs and cheering?

41:23.384 --> 41:25.594
Yeah. Yeah, that's me. Oliver.

41:25.678 --> 41:27.513
Ollie, if you're nasty.

41:27.596 --> 41:29.139
Okay, I'm gonna ignore
that last part.

41:29.223 --> 41:32.059
Listen, Principal Fisher
and her son, are they close?

41:32.142 --> 41:33.852
Yeah. Yeah. Real modern family.

41:33.936 --> 41:35.354
Single mom, only child.

41:35.854 --> 41:37.898
And you're her student aide.

41:37.982 --> 41:39.733
Do you need any help in the office?

41:39.817 --> 41:40.859
Yes!

41:40.943 --> 41:41.944
Great.

41:53.747 --> 41:54.748
Wow.

41:54.832 --> 41:56.333
- That was...
- Yum.

41:56.417 --> 41:59.211
- That was, um... Different.
- Oh.

41:59.295 --> 42:01.255
- Um...
- I like.

42:02.673 --> 42:03.841
Yeah.

42:03.924 --> 42:09.471
Yeah, something about
the, uh, impulsive nature of our meeting

42:09.555 --> 42:12.766
made me feel a little wild.
Didn't it?

42:13.100 --> 42:14.393
Oh, yeah.

42:14.476 --> 42:17.271
Casual hookups, no strings, no emotions.

42:17.354 --> 42:18.689
I am so good.

42:19.148 --> 42:20.983
Whoo. I'm gonna head out.

42:21.066 --> 42:22.484
Wait. You don't have to go yet.

42:22.568 --> 42:25.988
Oh, no. Super fun frolic.
Bang ya later. Maybe not. Who knows?

42:26.071 --> 42:27.406
Gotta go back to school.

42:40.753 --> 42:44.006
Oh, so you just happened to be
in the library during your free period?

42:44.506 --> 42:46.967
- Well, that's one way to say hello.
- Sorry.

42:47.051 --> 42:49.637
Hi, Grant. I'm afraid
now is not a good time

42:49.720 --> 42:51.096
to inappropriately flirt with me,

42:51.180 --> 42:53.474
not only because I have a boyfriend,

42:53.557 --> 42:57.770
but also because my fascist French teacher
also decided he likes daily pop quizzes.

42:57.853 --> 43:00.689
So I guess I'll be spending
my free periods learning French.

43:00.773 --> 43:03.525
Damn. You're really feeling yourself, huh?

43:03.609 --> 43:05.903
I'm just sitting here,
minding my business.

43:05.986 --> 43:07.529
Oh, so you're not gonna flirt with me?

43:07.613 --> 43:08.906
I mean, I'm not, now.

43:08.989 --> 43:10.616
Took all the fun out of it.

43:12.826 --> 43:13.827
All right, wait.

43:13.911 --> 43:16.872
I get it. Okay. You have a boyfriend.

43:16.956 --> 43:17.957
I'm sorry.

43:18.415 --> 43:22.378
It's just fun seeing you
get all flustered and worked up.

43:23.045 --> 43:24.922
You know, I actually speak French.

43:25.464 --> 43:27.716
I'd be more than happy
to help you prep for the quizzes.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.636
Just friends. Study buddies.

43:30.719 --> 43:32.930
All right, no funny business.

43:33.013 --> 43:34.348
Truth is, I'm kind of lonely.

43:34.431 --> 43:36.517
I mean, I don't know anyone
at this school.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.019
You'd be doing me a favor, seriously.

43:39.436 --> 43:41.188
You really speak French?

43:41.271 --> 43:42.523
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

43:45.359 --> 43:46.568
Fine.

43:51.365 --> 43:52.533
Just study buddies.

43:52.616 --> 43:53.617
Of course.

44:06.130 --> 44:08.507
<i>A goddess on a mountain top</i>

44:09.800 --> 44:12.177
<i>Was burning like a silver flame</i>

44:13.554 --> 44:16.015
<i>The summit of beauty and love</i>

44:17.099 --> 44:18.976
<i>And Venus was her name</i>

44:20.853 --> 44:21.979
<i>She's got it</i>

44:23.480 --> 44:25.441
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it</i>

44:28.861 --> 44:30.821
<i>I'm your Venus</i>

44:30.904 --> 44:33.699
<i>I'm your fire
At your desire</i>

44:35.868 --> 44:38.412
<i>Well, I'm your Venus</i>

44:38.495 --> 44:41.498
<i>I'm your fire
At your desire</i>

44:43.626 --> 44:46.795
<i>Her weapons were her crystal eyes</i>

44:47.504 --> 44:49.965
<i>Making every man mad</i>

44:50.883 --> 44:54.011
<i>Black as the dark night she was</i>

44:54.094 --> 44:56.805
<i>Got what no one else has</i>

44:58.599 --> 44:59.683
<i>She's got it</i>

45:00.976 --> 45:03.020
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it</i>

45:06.690 --> 45:08.359
<i>I'm your Venus</i>

45:08.442 --> 45:11.612
<i>I'm your fire
At your desire</i>

45:13.322 --> 45:15.658
<i>Well, I'm your Venus</i>

45:15.741 --> 45:18.827
<i>I'm your fire
At your desire</i>

45:30.965 --> 45:33.258
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it</i>

45:34.760 --> 45:37.054
<i>Yeah, baby, she's got it</i>

45:38.514 --> 45:40.015
<i>She's got it</i>

45:40.099 --> 45:43.852
This whole walk home I've been putting off
asking you to my mom's party.

45:43.936 --> 45:45.854
You know, teachers, old people,

45:45.938 --> 45:47.147
total rager.

45:47.231 --> 45:50.526
And it's Saturday afternoon,
as if it's for a child, so, even better.

45:50.609 --> 45:54.029
Uh, as fun as that sounds, I...

45:54.113 --> 45:58.117
See, that excitement level was exactly why
I put this off until the end of our walk.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.120
But lucky for me, your dad's totally
gonna make you go, anyway.

46:01.203 --> 46:03.789
Yeah, I think him and my mom,
like, have something going on.

46:03.872 --> 46:06.792
Ew.
Anyways, see you at the party.

46:07.209 --> 46:08.502
Wait. What?

46:09.128 --> 46:10.629
You're welcome.

46:11.755 --> 46:12.756
Ew.

46:16.719 --> 46:19.805
<i>I was all caught up for a while</i>

46:19.888 --> 46:21.849
I've dug up great stuff on Grant,
so just, uh, wait here,

46:21.932 --> 46:23.267
and don't steal anything. Okay?

46:23.350 --> 46:24.351
Great.

46:26.645 --> 46:29.273
<i>Too bad I was acting like a child</i>

46:30.774 --> 46:33.902
<i>I'd rather act like the woman I am</i>

46:49.960 --> 46:51.545
- What the shit is this?
- Wow.

46:51.629 --> 46:54.632
Your grasp of the English language
continues to astound.

46:54.715 --> 46:58.510
Uh, wow. Well, uh, I guess I don't
redecorate as much as I should.

46:58.594 --> 47:00.137
Oh, hardy-fuckin'-har.

47:00.220 --> 47:02.890
You have a picture of me. Framed.

47:02.973 --> 47:05.893
I know you probably didn't notice this,
but I'm in the picture as well.

47:08.187 --> 47:09.855
God, we were like nine.

47:10.439 --> 47:12.024
Dude, why do you even have this?

47:12.107 --> 47:13.776
I like it. Okay?

47:14.151 --> 47:15.945
Look at these kids, all right?
They're friends.

47:16.028 --> 47:17.613
No one's judging.

47:17.696 --> 47:19.239
No one has their feelings hurt.

47:19.323 --> 47:22.284
So I keep this around.

47:23.410 --> 47:24.703
You got a problem with that?

47:25.996 --> 47:26.997
No.

47:27.081 --> 47:31.001
Now, if you're ready
to set your psychological sex trap,

47:31.085 --> 47:33.504
I've got a decade of backstory.

47:33.587 --> 47:36.382
I can't express how much
I don't wanna go inside.

47:36.465 --> 47:38.509
Okay, you know what?
It's time that you understand

47:38.592 --> 47:40.719
what you want doesn't really matter.

47:40.803 --> 47:42.179
Take me, for example.

47:42.262 --> 47:45.432
I wake up every morning
and I drag myself to a job that I hate.

47:45.516 --> 47:48.102
Ah, life lesson. Neat.

47:48.185 --> 47:49.603
The point is...

47:49.687 --> 47:53.357
I'm gonna be fine as long as
you don't cock-block me tonight.

47:53.440 --> 47:54.441
<i>Comprende?</i>

47:54.650 --> 47:55.651
Ew!

47:57.069 --> 47:59.571
- Daddy! Gross. Yes.
- Gross!

47:59.655 --> 48:00.698
Get in there and be social.

48:12.793 --> 48:13.794
Oh, yeah.

48:15.796 --> 48:17.589
<i>It's on like Donkey Kong.</i>

48:18.257 --> 48:19.466
- Donkey what?
- See ya later.

48:22.678 --> 48:24.680
Party in the house!

48:26.265 --> 48:28.142
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, what are you doing here?

48:28.225 --> 48:30.394
- No way.
- What up, bitches?

48:30.477 --> 48:32.438
- What?
- Is this a wake or what?

48:32.521 --> 48:34.648
I'm super confused.
Why are you all here right now?

48:34.732 --> 48:35.733
Hey, Annie.

48:36.442 --> 48:37.735
- Ladies.
- Hey.

48:37.818 --> 48:40.029
Thank you for all coming
to my mom's lame party.

48:40.112 --> 48:42.156
Wait. I didn't know
you guys all knew Grant that well.

48:42.239 --> 48:45.159
Yeah, I only bought him, like,
three pumpkin spice lattes this week.

48:45.242 --> 48:46.243
Right?

48:46.327 --> 48:49.038
Well, he, um, carried me to safety
when I broke my leg.

48:50.247 --> 48:51.874
- When did you... Which one?
- Break your... Yeah.

48:51.957 --> 48:53.876
It's much better now.
Stephanie, what are you doing here?

48:53.959 --> 48:55.294
- I came with Emmett.
- Who?

48:55.377 --> 48:56.503
That kid. Yeah.

48:56.587 --> 48:58.714
So, he's Grant's best friend
and I'm friends with Emmett,

48:58.797 --> 49:00.215
so it's kind of like
Grant and I are besties.

49:00.299 --> 49:01.300
- Right?
- Is it?

49:01.383 --> 49:02.551
Sure.

49:02.635 --> 49:03.969
Oh, and where's your boyfriend, Kayla?

49:04.053 --> 49:06.221
I told you, Stephanie,

49:06.305 --> 49:07.931
- we broke up.
- Mmm.

49:08.015 --> 49:10.309
You keep on saying
how nonstop the sex has been, right?

49:10.392 --> 49:11.852
- Yeah.
- It's been like dirty

49:11.935 --> 49:13.395
and hungry, you know what I mean?

49:13.479 --> 49:14.480
Okay, uh, let's have a little...

49:14.563 --> 49:15.981
Can we have a little girls',
like, powwow, just outside?

49:16.065 --> 49:17.107
No, I'm fine.

49:17.191 --> 49:20.444
Okay, so apparently
you've all chosen Grant for the pact?

49:20.527 --> 49:22.404
Yeah, he's smart and articulate.

49:22.488 --> 49:23.572
Yeah, nice guy.

49:23.656 --> 49:24.865
- I mean, he hasn't hit on me once.
- Hmm.

49:24.949 --> 49:28.160
Have we considered
if that's because he's just not into you?

49:28.243 --> 49:29.244
Screw you.

49:29.328 --> 49:31.413
Rule number three,
I'm calling you on your bullshit.

49:31.497 --> 49:33.374
Making Tim jealous is not your goal.

49:33.457 --> 49:35.334
And as your accountability
partner, I'm just reminding you,

49:35.417 --> 49:37.795
- neither is kissing up to Grant's mom.
- Oh.

49:37.878 --> 49:39.546
Rule number two, we are best friends.

49:39.630 --> 49:40.631
We should support each other.

49:40.714 --> 49:42.466
We shouldn't let some boy
come between us.

49:42.800 --> 49:43.801
Us?

49:45.052 --> 49:46.720
I meant between you.

49:46.804 --> 49:49.765
Right. 'Cause Emmett and I have seen you
having little French lessons with Grant.

49:49.848 --> 49:50.849
Uh-huh. We've been studying.

49:50.933 --> 49:51.976
"Studying."

49:52.059 --> 49:53.227
I have a boyfriend.

49:53.310 --> 49:55.854
God, yes, Annie, we get it. Thank you!

49:55.938 --> 49:56.939
Hey!

49:57.523 --> 49:58.524
Everything cool?

49:59.024 --> 50:00.776
You know,
we should just table this. Okay?

50:00.859 --> 50:01.860
- But...
- Tabled!

50:02.152 --> 50:03.195
Uh...

50:03.279 --> 50:04.697
Stifler.

50:05.114 --> 50:06.532
It doesn't seem like he's that into her.

50:06.615 --> 50:08.492
Hmm. I thought you didn't care.

50:08.575 --> 50:10.577
I'm just making an observation.

50:11.412 --> 50:12.413
Right.

50:12.496 --> 50:14.164
You two, guard the stairs.

50:14.248 --> 50:15.582
I'm gonna do some recon.

50:15.666 --> 50:16.667
What does that mean?

50:16.750 --> 50:19.878
You know, check out his room,
scope it out, smell his underwear.

50:19.962 --> 50:21.380
- I don't know. Bing-bang-boom.
- What?

50:21.463 --> 50:23.966
That's kind of an invasion
of his privacy.

50:24.425 --> 50:26.135
- It is?
- Hmm?

50:26.218 --> 50:28.053
- Oh, my God, his privacy!
- Yeah.

50:28.137 --> 50:30.139
- Just guard the stairs, nerds.
- Okay.

50:33.559 --> 50:34.560
Oh, boy.

50:34.643 --> 50:37.813
You know, I think I'm gonna
do some recon work of my own.

50:38.272 --> 50:39.606
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

50:55.623 --> 51:00.461
{\an8}So, I do have some goodies,
but not enough to go around.

51:00.544 --> 51:02.379
- Oh, I don't care if anybody...
- Hey, Annie's dad!

51:02.463 --> 51:04.465
Principal Fisher.
I just wanted to tell you

51:04.548 --> 51:07.635
that I am so excited to have
a strong female role model to look up to.

51:07.718 --> 51:10.054
- I was thinking maybe you and I could...
- Aw! Oliver!

51:10.137 --> 51:11.138
Hmm.

51:11.597 --> 51:12.973
- Uh, uh...
- Hi. Principal Fisher

51:13.057 --> 51:15.309
doesn't wanna talk to you anymore,
but I would love to.

51:15.392 --> 51:17.728
- Do you wanna hear my JFK?
- Who are you?

51:17.811 --> 51:19.480
Something's been
missing out of my life.

51:19.563 --> 51:21.690
You know, like a void
that needs to be filled, even.

51:22.858 --> 51:23.901
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

51:23.984 --> 51:25.861
Okay, look,
I sense some resistance

51:25.945 --> 51:27.321
and I really don't know
what the problem is,

51:27.404 --> 51:29.531
so if you could just, like,
clear that up for me, that'd be great.

51:29.615 --> 51:30.616
Okay.

51:30.699 --> 51:33.786
Uh, well, for one, you hit me in the head
with a lacrosse ball, so...

51:33.869 --> 51:35.287
Dude, it was an accident.

51:35.371 --> 51:36.538
- Was it?
- Yeah.

51:36.622 --> 51:38.374
Mmm... I mean, I saw the Venmo.

51:38.457 --> 51:41.210
You got paid 20 bucks
for knocking out the new hot guy.

51:41.293 --> 51:43.462
Well, have you seen yourself?

51:44.505 --> 51:45.923
I forgot something in my room.

51:46.006 --> 51:47.633
- I'll be back.
- All right.

51:47.716 --> 51:49.802
- Nice ass.
- Yeah, thank you.

51:51.845 --> 51:53.263
Oh, shit.

51:54.682 --> 51:55.808
What the...

52:00.646 --> 52:01.814
Oh.

52:03.983 --> 52:05.276
Grant!

52:05.359 --> 52:06.443
Hi.

52:07.027 --> 52:08.279
Hey, you're, uh...

52:08.362 --> 52:09.697
You're missing the party.

52:09.780 --> 52:12.825
Yeah, I'm, uh, kinda hiding, actually.

52:12.908 --> 52:17.663
That girl Stephanie is so extra
and kind of terrifying.

52:17.746 --> 52:18.747
Oh.

52:19.206 --> 52:22.084
Uh, for your information,
guys are obsessed with her

52:22.167 --> 52:24.878
and she also happens to be
a really great person.

52:24.962 --> 52:25.963
So, um...

52:26.380 --> 52:27.631
I didn't mean anything by it.

52:27.715 --> 52:30.009
She's really nice. Just not my type.

52:31.302 --> 52:32.386
You are.

52:33.512 --> 52:35.681
Uh...

52:37.224 --> 52:40.519
I'm sorry. I know you have a boyfriend,

52:40.602 --> 52:43.731
and I'm not supposed to
say or feel anything,

52:43.814 --> 52:46.317
and I don't wanna ruin
the only friendship I have.

52:46.609 --> 52:47.735
No.

52:47.985 --> 52:48.986
No?

53:04.752 --> 53:06.045
Oh, hi.

53:06.879 --> 53:08.547
Breaking news, bitches!

53:09.840 --> 53:10.841
Oh, shit.

53:17.014 --> 53:18.015
Whoa!

53:19.725 --> 53:20.726
Oh, shit.

53:24.438 --> 53:26.357
<i>Wow. It is like Donkey Kong.</i>

53:27.650 --> 53:28.651
I'm okay.

53:36.241 --> 53:37.242
Ow.

53:38.827 --> 53:40.496
Okay, what the hell was that?

53:40.579 --> 53:42.665
Let me answer that question
with another question.

53:42.748 --> 53:44.208
What the hell is this?

53:44.291 --> 53:45.292
Annie!

53:45.709 --> 53:47.419
You said that you weren't
even interested in Grant.

53:47.503 --> 53:49.421
First of all, shh.
Second of all, delete that.

53:49.505 --> 53:51.256
- I... I didn't do anything.
- "I didn't do..."

53:51.340 --> 53:53.550
You were practically eating his face.

53:53.634 --> 53:55.803
- That's dramatic.
- What'd it taste like?

53:55.886 --> 53:57.346
Guys! I am sticky and embarrassed

53:57.429 --> 53:59.473
and I just got rejected by a man
for the first time in my life.

53:59.556 --> 54:00.808
- Oh, boo-hoo!
- Go cry me a river.

54:00.891 --> 54:01.892
Let's just call it a day.

54:01.976 --> 54:03.352
- Cool?
- Fine.

54:03.435 --> 54:05.145
Fine. I don't even care!

54:06.397 --> 54:08.816
Hey, Annie. Can we talk real quick?

54:08.899 --> 54:12.361
- Uh, nothing to talk about.
- Really?

54:12.444 --> 54:15.614
How about the girl doing a photo shoot
in my lacrosse uniform

54:15.698 --> 54:17.741
or I don't know,
how we kissed and you hit me?

54:17.825 --> 54:18.993
We did not kiss.

54:19.743 --> 54:20.744
You kissed me.

54:21.036 --> 54:22.705
Unannounced. Without permission.

54:22.788 --> 54:25.291
Come on. You gave me permission
with your face.

54:26.250 --> 54:28.919
You gave me kiss face.
It was... It was like...

54:29.503 --> 54:31.672
- Oh, my face did not do that.
- Yeah.

54:31.755 --> 54:32.756
- Yes, it did.
- It did not.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.633
- That's exactly what it did.
- I'm... I'm just gonna go home.

54:34.717 --> 54:36.218
- Okay.
- So it was good seeing you.

54:37.511 --> 54:38.554
- You live that way.
- I live that way.

54:38.637 --> 54:40.097
- Yup.
- I knew that.

55:18.927 --> 55:20.304
<i>Bonjour.</i>

56:12.982 --> 56:14.191
No, no, no.

56:14.608 --> 56:15.734
No, no, no.

56:16.193 --> 56:17.736
You don't like Grant.

56:17.820 --> 56:20.197
You love Jason.

56:29.957 --> 56:32.418
Nope. Nope, nope, nope.

56:36.422 --> 56:38.215
Uh, biology is this way.

56:38.299 --> 56:39.425
I'm going to see Jason.

56:39.508 --> 56:41.260
This waiting around is making me crazy.

56:41.343 --> 56:44.263
Wait. Are you cutting class?
You never cut class.

56:44.346 --> 56:46.390
Some things are more important.
He's only three hours away.

56:46.473 --> 56:48.851
I can get there, bang it out,
get my head straight,

56:48.934 --> 56:50.227
be back before dinner.

56:50.311 --> 56:52.563
- Annie, are you talking about...
- Sex!

56:52.646 --> 56:55.649
I'm going to have sex
with the man that I love.

56:55.733 --> 56:56.900
Yo, girl, go get you some!

56:56.984 --> 56:58.360
No glove, no love!

56:58.444 --> 57:01.280
Okay! I'm so excited for you.

57:01.864 --> 57:03.365
Let me get this straight.

57:03.449 --> 57:05.951
You went from Tim's girlfriend
to his side piece.

57:07.077 --> 57:09.204
And you're happy with that?
Isn't that kind of like a demotion?

57:09.288 --> 57:11.040
No, you don't get it. It's casual.

57:11.123 --> 57:12.499
Girl, I invented casual.

57:12.583 --> 57:13.792
That's not what you're doing.

57:13.876 --> 57:15.252
What you're doing is
pretending it's casual

57:15.336 --> 57:17.171
so you can still fuck the guy you like.

57:18.213 --> 57:20.174
- Oh, my God.
- There ya go.

57:20.257 --> 57:22.384
I do still like him.

57:22.468 --> 57:27.806
Our casual, no-strings-attached sex
is neither casual nor without strings!

57:27.890 --> 57:30.059
- There are feelings!
- Does Tim know that?

57:30.476 --> 57:32.936
No. No, he does not, but he will.

57:33.646 --> 57:35.522
He's gonna know right now.

57:36.398 --> 57:38.150
- Okay.
- Kayla?

57:39.818 --> 57:41.487
- She okay?
- Who knows?

57:41.570 --> 57:44.490
Well, get this.
Annie just left school to go see Jason.

57:44.573 --> 57:46.158
No shit! Good for her.

57:46.241 --> 57:48.077
- You know what this means, though?
- What?

57:48.160 --> 57:49.161
Annie wins.

57:50.371 --> 57:53.248
She does. After she does the deed,
she's fulfilled her goal.

57:53.332 --> 57:54.833
Kayla is still obsessed with Tim.

57:54.917 --> 57:56.502
I'm absolutely nowhere.

57:56.585 --> 57:58.963
And Grant seems to be the only guy
in school who doesn't lust after you.

58:00.005 --> 58:01.256
It's not over yet.

58:01.340 --> 58:02.508
Oh, come on, Steph.

58:02.591 --> 58:03.968
The MORP is in a week.

58:04.051 --> 58:05.761
Champions are made in the last quarter.

58:06.387 --> 58:07.972
Game just got interesting.

58:13.060 --> 58:15.562
Hey. Hey. Glad you came.

58:15.646 --> 58:17.940
- Um, I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

58:18.524 --> 58:19.775
Why are we in the library?

58:19.858 --> 58:21.277
Nobody ever comes back here.

58:21.360 --> 58:22.820
Dangerous...

58:22.903 --> 58:24.363
Sexy, huh?

58:26.949 --> 58:27.992
Oh, you hate it.

58:28.075 --> 58:29.201
God, I'm sorry.

58:29.285 --> 58:31.161
It was such a stupid idea.

58:31.245 --> 58:34.081
Look, I respect you
and I just want you to know

58:34.164 --> 58:36.834
that this is always a safe space.

58:38.836 --> 58:40.421
All right, pants off, make it quick.

58:40.504 --> 58:42.006
I'm sure that will not be a problem. Oh!

58:44.550 --> 58:46.343
Principal Fisher? Oh.

58:46.677 --> 58:47.970
Sorry. I can come back.

58:48.053 --> 58:49.221
No, that's okay.

58:49.305 --> 58:51.640
Well, it's kind of a weird situation.

58:51.724 --> 58:54.059
- See, I made this pact...
- No, no, no.

58:54.143 --> 58:55.185
Sorry.

58:55.311 --> 58:56.312
Um...

58:56.645 --> 58:57.855
I made this pact with my friends

58:57.938 --> 59:00.441
that I would try and date somebody
who I'm really proud of

59:00.524 --> 59:01.734
and who really gets me,

59:01.817 --> 59:04.528
but I feel like in doing so,
I've kind of lost sight of myself.

59:04.612 --> 59:06.739
I mean, I thought that Grant
was the guy that I wanted

59:06.822 --> 59:10.326
because he's smart
and he's cute and he's socially conscious.

59:10.409 --> 59:12.161
- Great job on that, by the way.
- Thanks.

59:12.244 --> 59:13.996
But I don't even know who I've become.

59:14.079 --> 59:18.167
Like, I'm pretending to be weak
and helpless to manipulate a man?

59:18.250 --> 59:19.835
What would Ruth Bader Ginsburg say?

59:19.918 --> 59:21.045
I mean, I don't need a man
to complete me.

59:21.128 --> 59:23.964
I'm a strong, smart,
independent woman. Right?

59:24.048 --> 59:26.884
Michelle, there is nothing wrong
with wanting to be in a relationship.

59:26.967 --> 59:29.303
Everybody deserves a little romance.

59:29.386 --> 59:31.764
But I do think
you're barking up the wrong tree.

59:31.847 --> 59:33.849
I mean, if Grant were
the right guy for you,

59:33.932 --> 59:36.518
you wouldn't have to be
anything but yourself.

59:36.602 --> 59:39.605
It does, however,
make me think of another young man,

59:39.688 --> 59:43.233
a young man who happened
to score 1,590 on his SAT,

59:43.317 --> 59:45.694
a young man who volunteers
every single weekend.

59:46.862 --> 59:48.489
You're describing my ideal mate.

59:48.572 --> 59:52.034
He is obsessed with presidential history.

59:52.117 --> 59:53.535
Are you shitting me, Principal Fisher?

59:53.619 --> 59:55.829
I shit you not, Michelle.
Watch your language.

59:55.913 --> 59:59.583
His name is Oliver Hawthorn,
and you work with him every single day,

59:59.667 --> 01:00:02.127
and he clearly has
an obvious crush on you.

01:00:02.544 --> 01:00:04.046
Now get out, I'm very busy.

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:06.090
Right. Okay.

01:00:07.675 --> 01:00:08.884
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

01:00:09.551 --> 01:00:11.929
Oh, well, I mean, what can you expect?

01:00:12.012 --> 01:00:13.472
She's been through a lot.

01:00:19.561 --> 01:00:22.815
So, um, I hear you're into presidents.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.025
Uh, just Kennedy.

01:00:26.318 --> 01:00:29.488
"My fellow Americans,
ask not what your country can do for you.

01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:30.823
"Ask what you can do for your country."

01:00:31.615 --> 01:00:32.866
It's not
a very good impression,

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:33.951
but I mean, I'm trying to perfect it.

01:00:34.034 --> 01:00:36.495
- Um, I... I actually have to go.
- Okay.

01:00:36.578 --> 01:00:38.163
- Right now.
- Oh.

01:00:38.247 --> 01:00:39.248
Bye.

01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:43.502
Oh, man.

01:00:43.585 --> 01:00:46.297
Since we broke up,
the sex just keeps getting better, right?

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.052
Hey, what's up? You okay?

01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:57.516
What are the odds, uh,
this isn't just meaningless sex to you?

01:01:00.811 --> 01:01:05.065
What are the odds, um,
that you're actually in love with me,

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:08.277
but you're just afraid
of your feelings

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:12.948
and, um, deep in your heart
you wanna stay with me?

01:01:18.787 --> 01:01:19.872
That's what I thought.

01:01:20.706 --> 01:01:23.792
Um, I can't do this casual thing.

01:01:25.419 --> 01:01:27.046
Not with you.

01:01:27.755 --> 01:01:29.214
I just want more.

01:01:32.009 --> 01:01:33.302
I deserve more.

01:01:36.847 --> 01:01:37.931
Bye, Tim.

01:01:44.647 --> 01:01:46.315
Hey, Jason, it's me.

01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:49.443
I can't really talk right now,
and I know you're in class anyway,

01:01:49.526 --> 01:01:51.570
but I have a surprise for you.

01:01:51.654 --> 01:01:53.781
So, call me back
when you get this, okay?

01:01:53.864 --> 01:01:55.532
I love you. Bye.

01:01:55.616 --> 01:01:57.326
<i>Don't let this slip away</i>

01:01:57.409 --> 01:01:59.578
<i>Maybe this road leads to Rome</i>

01:01:59.662 --> 01:02:02.373
<i>But, baby, you make me feel at home</i>

01:02:02.456 --> 01:02:06.210
<i>Together we're unstoppable
It's undeniable</i>

01:02:06.293 --> 01:02:08.921
<i>Let's go, go, go, go</i>

01:02:09.004 --> 01:02:12.174
<i>Let's go all the way tonight</i>

01:02:12.257 --> 01:02:15.511
<i>Take me all the way tonight</i>

01:02:15.594 --> 01:02:18.472
<i>Baby, we can make this last</i>

01:02:18.555 --> 01:02:21.517
<i>Nothing's gonna hold us back</i>

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.853
<i>Let's take it all the way tonight</i>

01:02:24.937 --> 01:02:28.190
<i>Leave it up to fate tonight</i>

01:02:28.273 --> 01:02:29.316
Thanks, buddy.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.819
<i>So let's go all the way tonight</i>

01:02:31.902 --> 01:02:33.946
Up top, baby. Hit me! One more.

01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:37.700
<i>Let's take it all the way tonight</i>

01:02:37.783 --> 01:02:41.245
<i>Leave it up to fate tonight</i>

01:02:41.328 --> 01:02:44.623
<i>So let's go all the way tonight</i>

01:02:44.707 --> 01:02:48.752
<i>{\an8}Let's go all the way tonight, tonight</i>

01:02:51.338 --> 01:02:54.008
I'm gonna pop.
I'm gonna pop. I'm gonna pop.

01:02:54.091 --> 01:02:55.634
Oh, I'm popping!

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.261
Oh.

01:02:57.344 --> 01:02:59.138
Um, Annie.

01:02:59.263 --> 01:03:01.140
Are you kidding me?

01:03:01.307 --> 01:03:03.017
Uh...

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.268
It's not what it looks like.

01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:05.602
- It's not?
- No.

01:03:05.686 --> 01:03:07.104
Um, she's my math tutor.

01:03:07.187 --> 01:03:08.439
Was she tutoring you right now?

01:03:08.522 --> 01:03:09.773
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God!

01:03:09.857 --> 01:03:11.275
- Just calm down.
- Calm down?

01:03:11.358 --> 01:03:13.777
You think telling me to calm down
is gonna make me calm down?

01:03:13.861 --> 01:03:15.362
Well, you're acting a little hysterical.

01:03:15.446 --> 01:03:18.449
Am I? Am I a little bit hysterical?

01:03:19.658 --> 01:03:21.535
That really hurt bad!

01:03:24.204 --> 01:03:25.456
Wait here.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.881
Annie. Annie.

01:03:33.964 --> 01:03:35.924
Annie, honey. Honey. Honey.

01:03:36.008 --> 01:03:39.053
Sorry. Annie, um,
talk to you one second?

01:03:39.136 --> 01:03:40.304
- What?
- Please.

01:03:40.387 --> 01:03:41.930
What do you wanna say?

01:03:42.348 --> 01:03:45.517
I don't know.
Long distance relationships are rough.

01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:46.810
Oh, is that right?

01:03:46.894 --> 01:03:48.812
Yeah, I mean,
there's so many hot chicks here.

01:03:49.438 --> 01:03:51.398
You're hot too, obviously.
Of course.

01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:53.108
It's just, you know,
you're not college-hot.

01:03:53.192 --> 01:03:54.443
Your brain is hot.

01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:57.696
Jason, I'm breaking up with you.

01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.824
I only came here because I felt guilty.

01:04:00.908 --> 01:04:02.910
I like someone else.

01:04:02.993 --> 01:04:06.163
He kissed me and I liked it,
and it freaked me out.

01:04:06.246 --> 01:04:07.247
Okay.

01:04:07.331 --> 01:04:10.250
So, I thought if I came here,
if I saw you,

01:04:10.334 --> 01:04:13.796
if we made love, then my feelings for you
would come rushing back.

01:04:15.047 --> 01:04:16.382
When I saw you with her,

01:04:17.508 --> 01:04:20.678
after the anger, you know what I felt?

01:04:22.346 --> 01:04:23.555
I felt relief.

01:04:24.932 --> 01:04:25.933
Some dude kissed you?

01:04:27.685 --> 01:04:28.686
What?

01:04:30.688 --> 01:04:32.898
You're just really not
who I wanted you to be.

01:04:35.192 --> 01:04:37.319
Wow, that was... That was rough.

01:04:39.863 --> 01:04:41.991
Nice towel, douchebag.

01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:57.131
Oh.

01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:58.590
Oh.

01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:00.301
Annie, have you been crying?

01:05:00.926 --> 01:05:02.428
Oh, honey.

01:05:02.511 --> 01:05:04.263
Oh, I think I know what this is.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.681
Annie, don't worry.

01:05:05.764 --> 01:05:08.225
Ellen's not trying to become
your new mommy.

01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:11.895
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, that's not why she's upset.

01:05:11.979 --> 01:05:15.566
Clearly, she's mortified 'cause she just
walked in on us about to have sex.

01:05:16.108 --> 01:05:18.068
Yeah. Yeah. What she said.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.323
Oh. No, this is...
This is just a casual thing.

01:05:22.406 --> 01:05:24.241
I think the kids call it F-buddies.

01:05:24.325 --> 01:05:25.909
On that note, okay.

01:05:25.993 --> 01:05:27.786
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.335
Annie? Can I come in.

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:35.753
Okay.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.896
Annie, did, um...
Did what you see downstairs upset you?

01:05:53.979 --> 01:05:56.357
Oh, no, it makes perfect sense.

01:05:56.899 --> 01:05:58.651
Everyone's having sex but me.

01:05:59.318 --> 01:06:00.361
Sex?

01:06:00.444 --> 01:06:03.447
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say it.

01:06:04.865 --> 01:06:06.533
I broke up with Jason.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:08.911
Oh.

01:06:09.244 --> 01:06:10.746
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:13.040
I'm not.

01:06:15.668 --> 01:06:16.710
Oh, babe.

01:06:16.794 --> 01:06:20.589
You are the most
incredible person I know.

01:06:20.673 --> 01:06:23.634
You're so smart, you're so funny.

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:25.970
You are so beautiful.

01:06:26.595 --> 01:06:28.305
I don't need a pep talk, Dad.

01:06:28.389 --> 01:06:31.141
That Jason never deserved you.

01:06:33.268 --> 01:06:37.731
And I never liked the guy, so there!

01:06:37.815 --> 01:06:38.941
Wait. Really?

01:06:39.024 --> 01:06:41.527
No. He was a total brobag.

01:06:43.737 --> 01:06:45.239
Mmm.

01:06:45.656 --> 01:06:46.907
I love you, Dad.

01:06:48.033 --> 01:06:49.326
I love you too, babe.

01:07:00.629 --> 01:07:03.173
- Grant. Hey-hey.
- Hey.

01:07:03.257 --> 01:07:06.260
So, I'm having a little gathering
at my place tonight,

01:07:06.343 --> 01:07:07.386
if you wanna come.

01:07:08.095 --> 01:07:10.264
Cool. Have you seen Annie, by chance?

01:07:11.015 --> 01:07:12.016
Oh.

01:07:12.099 --> 01:07:14.685
Oh, well, she went to go
visit her boyfriend at college yesterday.

01:07:14.768 --> 01:07:16.854
Yeah, they're probably
still banging it out.

01:07:16.937 --> 01:07:17.938
But back to my thing.

01:07:18.022 --> 01:07:21.567
So, my favorite saxophone
player, Vladimir Ullich, he's amazing...

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:23.777
- Are... Are you being serious?
- What?

01:07:23.861 --> 01:07:26.697
Vladimir Ullich is, like,
my favorite musician of all time.

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:27.865
- Is it really?
- Yeah.

01:07:27.948 --> 01:07:29.992
What... What are the odds
of that happening?

01:07:30.075 --> 01:07:31.994
- Not high.
- Well, you should stop by then.

01:07:32.077 --> 01:07:34.705
It's, like, a listening party.
Like, we'll play it all night.

01:07:34.788 --> 01:07:36.749
I mean, I'm quirky, so...

01:07:36.832 --> 01:07:38.208
You know what? Cool.

01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:39.376
- Oh, great.
- Great.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:40.628
- Great. I'll see you there.
- All right

01:07:41.795 --> 01:07:43.005
<i>Baby, she's drop dead gorgeous</i>

01:07:43.088 --> 01:07:44.256
<i>Drop dead</i>

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.842
Oh. My bad. I'll see you.

01:07:46.925 --> 01:07:48.552
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.347
<i>Baby, she's drop dead gorgeous</i>

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:52.556
<i>Drop dead</i>

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.766
Freeze!

01:07:54.016 --> 01:07:55.142
I got eyes on Annie.

01:07:55.434 --> 01:07:56.435
Quad, stat.

01:07:57.853 --> 01:08:00.230
- Well, well, well, look who it is.
- What's this?

01:08:00.481 --> 01:08:02.107
- Well, well, well, look...
- I already did that.

01:08:02.191 --> 01:08:03.525
- Damn it.
- Annie!

01:08:03.609 --> 01:08:06.195
You disappear, lose your virginity,
no call, no text?

01:08:06.278 --> 01:08:07.655
Like, you ghosted us.

01:08:08.572 --> 01:08:10.574
Sorry. I've just been dead.

01:08:11.116 --> 01:08:12.451
Because of all the sex?

01:08:12.576 --> 01:08:14.328
Girl, this is a big-ass moment for you.

01:08:14.453 --> 01:08:16.496
Shit!

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.957
Okay, we'll talk tonight? But you all
are coming to my party tonight, right?

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.375
- Yeah, duh.
- Okay. Great.

01:08:20.459 --> 01:08:22.877
And since Annie has had
sweet Freeform TV sex,

01:08:22.962 --> 01:08:25.421
I'll swoop in and seduce
the lovely Grant.

01:08:25.506 --> 01:08:28.174
- Yes! What's up! Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:08:28.258 --> 01:08:30.928
- Mama had sex!
- She ain't a virgin!

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:33.930
<i>{\an8}We make the beat go
boom, boom, boom</i>

01:08:34.013 --> 01:08:35.683
<i>Boom, boom, boom</i>

01:08:35.765 --> 01:08:38.893
<i>I like the sound it makes
Boom, boom, boom</i>

01:08:38.978 --> 01:08:41.062
You do this kind of thing
every weekend?

01:08:41.145 --> 01:08:44.107
Stifler's parties are the bedrock
on which East Great Falls was built.

01:08:44.232 --> 01:08:47.611
And tonight, we're using the party gods
to seduce the new guy.

01:08:47.694 --> 01:08:50.029
Wow. You need to sacrifice
a virgin or something?

01:08:50.113 --> 01:08:51.490
No, don't worry, you're safe.

01:08:51.573 --> 01:08:53.033
Okay, so we thought of everything, right?

01:08:53.116 --> 01:08:55.618
- Grant's favorite music, snacks, drinks?
- Yeah.

01:08:55.703 --> 01:08:57.203
I mean, I'm even wearing
his favorite color.

01:08:57.412 --> 01:08:59.330
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:01.250
- He's a lucky guy.
- I know.

01:09:01.959 --> 01:09:02.960
Oh.

01:09:04.502 --> 01:09:05.754
Here you go.

01:09:06.587 --> 01:09:07.923
What... What's this?

01:09:08.464 --> 01:09:10.426
Wait, I pay you
and you buy me something?

01:09:11.218 --> 01:09:12.428
That's fucking stupid.

01:09:12.511 --> 01:09:15.471
- The usual response is, "Thank you."
- Mmm.

01:09:19.727 --> 01:09:20.978
It's a lipstick case.

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:25.232
On, uh...
On which to make notches.

01:09:27.484 --> 01:09:29.361
It's a present, a thoughtful one.

01:09:31.321 --> 01:09:33.490
- I also wrapped it.
- Yeah, and you...

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:34.908
- And you wrapped it. Uh...
- Whoo!

01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:38.578
Well, my girls are here
so I should... I should go.

01:09:40.121 --> 01:09:41.582
- Sure.
- Yeah.

01:09:42.499 --> 01:09:43.500
Hey, hey. Uh...

01:09:45.294 --> 01:09:46.337
Good luck with Grant.

01:09:47.087 --> 01:09:49.381
Emmett, thank you. For everything.

01:09:50.214 --> 01:09:52.801
And my present. I love it.

01:09:56.972 --> 01:09:59.433
What up, bitches!

01:09:59.516 --> 01:10:01.018
Welcome to Bang-Grant Palooza!

01:10:01.268 --> 01:10:03.062
- Ow.
- Hi, boo-boo, how are you?

01:10:03.145 --> 01:10:04.772
Hey, you know, being a good winner

01:10:04.855 --> 01:10:06.774
is just as important
as being a good loser, Steph.

01:10:06.857 --> 01:10:08.484
- Oh, you're throwing shade?
- Way to read a room.

01:10:09.068 --> 01:10:10.903
Guys, when did this
turn into a competition?

01:10:10.986 --> 01:10:13.405
This was never supposed to be
about us competing for a boy.

01:10:13.489 --> 01:10:15.199
Yeah, this was supposed
to make me feel better.

01:10:15.824 --> 01:10:17.368
I don't feel better.

01:10:17.493 --> 01:10:20.704
Now you're gonna smash Grant
when he really likes Annie.

01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:23.123
- What?
- Uh, yeah.

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.625
When I was in his room,

01:10:24.708 --> 01:10:27.419
he told her he liked her
and then he kissed her.

01:10:27.503 --> 01:10:29.505
Okay, well you made it
sound like it was the other way around.

01:10:29.588 --> 01:10:31.131
I can be a little extra sometimes.

01:10:31.215 --> 01:10:32.383
Yeah, no shit!

01:10:32.591 --> 01:10:33.926
- Hey, Emmett!
- What's up, man?

01:10:34.009 --> 01:10:36.178
I mean, he's cute,
but he's not worth this.

01:10:36.512 --> 01:10:38.097
- I'm out, guys.
- Ladies, hey.

01:10:38.514 --> 01:10:40.432
- Look who I found.
- Hey.

01:10:42.601 --> 01:10:44.144
Oh. Uh...

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:45.896
What do you think of Annie?

01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:47.231
She's great.

01:10:48.023 --> 01:10:51.318
I mean, she's cool, smart, kind, funny.

01:10:51.402 --> 01:10:53.612
Awkward, but in a really
entertaining way.

01:10:53.696 --> 01:10:57.074
- Is she here?
- Oh. No, no, no, but she will be. Right?

01:10:57.157 --> 01:10:59.743
Uh, can you guys just,
like, talk for a sec?

01:11:00.452 --> 01:11:01.453
I know. I know.

01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:08.502
Oh, my God!

01:11:08.877 --> 01:11:12.464
- You are tightly wound. Wow.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:12.548 --> 01:11:13.799
I'm sorry.

01:11:13.882 --> 01:11:16.302
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- That's okay. That's okay.

01:11:16.385 --> 01:11:19.388
Your father and I
just worked up a real appetite tonight,

01:11:19.471 --> 01:11:21.890
so I'm having a little ice cream.
You want some?

01:11:21.974 --> 01:11:23.100
Um...

01:11:23.183 --> 01:11:24.393
Sorry.

01:11:25.686 --> 01:11:26.687
Um...

01:11:27.313 --> 01:11:28.814
Yeah, you know what,
I'll have some ice cream.

01:11:28.897 --> 01:11:29.898
Great.

01:11:29.982 --> 01:11:31.859
She's not answering.

01:11:31.942 --> 01:11:34.111
Well, go get her
and drag her ass here. Okay?

01:11:34.403 --> 01:11:36.155
- Okay.
- Come with me.

01:11:36.238 --> 01:11:37.781
Ready for some sexy saxophone?

01:11:37.865 --> 01:11:39.450
- She's back.
- Let's go.

01:11:40.367 --> 01:11:42.286
Hey! I need to talk to you.

01:11:42.578 --> 01:11:44.663
Tim, I cannot do this right now.

01:11:44.747 --> 01:11:45.748
We have to go get...

01:11:45.831 --> 01:11:47.666
Kayla, please.

01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:49.335
It's cool. I got this.

01:11:50.502 --> 01:11:51.754
Good luck.

01:11:53.005 --> 01:11:54.632
I thought there was a party tonight.

01:11:55.549 --> 01:11:57.051
- Not in the mood.
- Hmm.

01:11:58.594 --> 01:11:59.970
Can I talk to you about something?

01:12:00.054 --> 01:12:01.930
Should I be afraid of
what you're about to say?

01:12:02.264 --> 01:12:05.017
I can never tell. I just let it fly.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.770
Here's the thing.
I've noticed that you've been upset

01:12:07.853 --> 01:12:10.064
and my son has also been upset.

01:12:10.147 --> 01:12:13.651
And I wonder if you're both upset
about the same thing.

01:12:22.993 --> 01:12:25.412
<i>- What can I help you with?
- Call Annie.</i>

01:12:25.579 --> 01:12:27.498
<i>Here's what I found on the web for Fannie.</i>

01:12:27.581 --> 01:12:28.707
No, call Annie!

01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:30.167
<i>Calling Manny's Pizza.</i>

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.419
- No! Annie!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:38.133
Gonna feel that tomorrow.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.760
<i>- Hello. Manny's Pizza.
- Oh, my God!</i>

01:12:40.135 --> 01:12:42.054
<i>- Hello!
- Oliver?</i>

01:12:42.137 --> 01:12:44.223
- Oh, my God, please be okay.
- Hi.

01:12:44.306 --> 01:12:45.599
What are you doing in front of my car?

01:12:45.683 --> 01:12:46.892
I'm trying to stop you from leaving.

01:12:47.351 --> 01:12:48.477
I mean, you're the only reason I came.

01:12:48.936 --> 01:12:50.813
Oh, my God, that's actually really sweet.

01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:53.649
- Um, I have to go get my friend now...
- Do you mind if I come with?

01:12:53.732 --> 01:12:55.317
I mean, you did just
run me over with your car.

01:12:56.151 --> 01:12:57.152
Uh...

01:12:57.403 --> 01:12:58.904
Okay, cool. Yeah, come on, come on.

01:12:58.988 --> 01:13:00.030
Oh, shit.

01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:01.699
I don't like the way
you left the other day.

01:13:01.782 --> 01:13:03.033
Tough shit!

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:06.704
Okay, I've got feelings and emotions.

01:13:06.996 --> 01:13:10.291
I'm a little jealous
and a bit of a handful.

01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:17.673
But if you can't take me
at my making-a-scene-at-a-party-ness,

01:13:17.756 --> 01:13:22.469
then you don't deserve me
at my fucking-you-in-the-library-ness.

01:13:23.679 --> 01:13:24.680
You're right.

01:13:25.222 --> 01:13:26.515
Everything you said.

01:13:27.057 --> 01:13:30.394
Truth is, I don't want you
violating my trust.

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:33.731
But I do want you.

01:13:34.815 --> 01:13:37.192
You're my lobster.

01:13:37.276 --> 01:13:38.861
- Holy shit.
- That's right.

01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:40.738
- "You're my lobster!"
- Yeah.

01:13:41.447 --> 01:13:44.533
- I didn't think you were gonna say that.
- Oh, yeah, Kayla!

01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:50.414
High school is the worst.

01:13:50.914 --> 01:13:53.709
It is. And you think
that it's never gonna end, but it does.

01:13:53.792 --> 01:13:57.004
And when it does,
time starts to move a lot faster.

01:13:57.087 --> 01:14:00.466
So when you know what you want,
you should go after it.

01:14:00.799 --> 01:14:02.885
'Cause you might not get another chance.

01:14:08.557 --> 01:14:10.559
Annie, get dressed. Grant is looking...

01:14:10.643 --> 01:14:13.145
- Oh, Principal Fisher's here!
- In a bathrobe.

01:14:13.228 --> 01:14:15.230
- Hi.
- Michelle, Oliver, is everything okay?

01:14:15.981 --> 01:14:17.733
Oh. Yeah, I just didn't wanna
leave him in the car.

01:14:17.816 --> 01:14:18.984
I have got a knee issue,

01:14:19.068 --> 01:14:21.236
but it's not as important as love.

01:14:21.904 --> 01:14:24.573
Um, Annie, Grant's at the party
and he's looking for you.

01:14:24.657 --> 01:14:27.201
The whole pact is off.
We all know that he likes you.

01:14:27.284 --> 01:14:29.620
- He does?
- Yeah, Annie, he does.

01:14:30.788 --> 01:14:32.081
This is an incredible moment
and everything,

01:14:32.164 --> 01:14:34.333
but Oliver is actually
much heavier than he looks.

01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:35.751
I'm wiry but muscular.

01:14:36.126 --> 01:14:37.294
- It's a family trait.
- Yeah.

01:14:37.544 --> 01:14:38.545
Uh...

01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:43.550
Sorry, yeah, go wait in the car.
I guess I'll change and be right out.

01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:46.595
I am so excited for you for tonight.

01:14:46.679 --> 01:14:50.140
Now don't you be afraid to go after Grant
just because of me and your father.

01:14:50.224 --> 01:14:52.559
We're not gonna
make you guys step-siblings.

01:14:52.643 --> 01:14:54.520
We both know this thing has a shelf life.

01:14:54.603 --> 01:14:56.563
Besides, he took
his last Viagra this morning.

01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:02.987
I'm gonna go pretend I didn't hear that,
and I'll be right out, so...

01:15:03.654 --> 01:15:04.863
Okay.

01:15:04.947 --> 01:15:07.533
This is... This is so good,

01:15:07.616 --> 01:15:08.784
and this is...

01:15:08.867 --> 01:15:10.661
Wow, but, um you know,

01:15:10.744 --> 01:15:13.580
uh, we have to actually
deal with some party stuff. Right? Yeah.

01:15:13.664 --> 01:15:17.626
And so if you just wanna
stay there and just really soak it all in.

01:15:18.544 --> 01:15:20.170
Let's just go, okay? Let's just...

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.548
- Okay.
- Stay?

01:15:26.302 --> 01:15:29.722
Okay. We keep Grant occupied with
his old man music until Annie gets here

01:15:29.805 --> 01:15:31.807
and then boom,
big romantic moment. Got it? Great.

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:34.310
Hey, wait, wait.
I thought you liked Grant, so...

01:15:34.393 --> 01:15:36.562
I just kind of liked the idea of him.

01:15:36.645 --> 01:15:39.273
Look, Annie's my best friend,
and if she wants him, she gets him.

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:40.983
So maybe dating a nice guy

01:15:41.066 --> 01:15:42.401
just isn't in the cards
for Stephanie Stifler.

01:15:42.484 --> 01:15:45.321
Look, a queen bee walking around
like she owns the place.

01:15:45.404 --> 01:15:48.449
Ooh, burn. Except I do own the place,
you fucking idiot.

01:15:49.074 --> 01:15:50.909
Is this your stud for the night, Stifler?

01:15:50.993 --> 01:15:52.494
I didn't think your standards
could fall any lower.

01:15:53.245 --> 01:15:55.497
Well, I haven't slept with you yet,
so I got that going for me.

01:15:55.581 --> 01:15:57.499
Yeah, whatever you wanna tell people.

01:15:59.168 --> 01:16:02.254
McCormick, are you telling people
we hooked up?

01:16:02.713 --> 01:16:04.214
I never said I don't kiss and tell.

01:16:05.007 --> 01:16:06.300
- Fuck you.
- No, no.

01:16:06.425 --> 01:16:08.385
Hey. You're being rude.

01:16:08.469 --> 01:16:09.887
- Emmett, don't...
- No, no, no, it's okay.

01:16:10.554 --> 01:16:13.682
You have five seconds to
apologize or I unleash hell.

01:16:17.978 --> 01:16:18.979
Five!

01:16:19.063 --> 01:16:20.064
Emmett!

01:16:20.773 --> 01:16:24.193
- Wow. He, uh, hit me with his face.
- What the hell?

01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:26.070
Grant, can you just watch him
for a sec? Thanks.

01:16:26.153 --> 01:16:27.404
Hey, asshole!

01:16:28.197 --> 01:16:29.365
I don't like bullies,

01:16:29.448 --> 01:16:31.951
and I don't like misogynistic douchebags
drinking my liquor

01:16:32.034 --> 01:16:33.702
and disrespecting me
in my own house.

01:16:33.786 --> 01:16:35.621
I don't like you, McCormick!

01:16:36.038 --> 01:16:37.289
Yes, bitch!

01:16:40.584 --> 01:16:42.127
But you know who I do like?

01:16:43.921 --> 01:16:44.922
Ow.

01:16:47.466 --> 01:16:48.467
Hey.

01:16:56.892 --> 01:16:58.477
You kissed me.

01:16:58.978 --> 01:17:00.354
You stood up for me.

01:17:00.688 --> 01:17:01.689
I mean, you were my wingman

01:17:01.772 --> 01:17:03.607
even though you liked me
more than a wingman.

01:17:04.441 --> 01:17:05.943
And you bought me a present.

01:17:07.778 --> 01:17:09.238
I think I just won.

01:17:20.582 --> 01:17:21.583
You Grant?

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.461
Do I know you?

01:17:36.098 --> 01:17:37.099
Oh, no.

01:17:40.436 --> 01:17:41.895
What is he doing here?

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:44.732
Yeah, man,
so there you have it.

01:17:44.815 --> 01:17:46.317
Now you kind of know the people
you're dealing with.

01:17:46.734 --> 01:17:48.110
What the hell are you doing?

01:17:48.694 --> 01:17:49.987
Oh. Uh...

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:52.740
I just thought your new boyfriend
should know the truth.

01:17:53.324 --> 01:17:55.868
Annie, did you and your friends
make a bet about me?

01:17:55.951 --> 01:17:56.952
It wasn't a bet.

01:17:57.661 --> 01:17:59.496
- It was a pact.
- Oh, bullshit.

01:17:59.788 --> 01:18:00.831
Okay, all of these little bitches

01:18:00.914 --> 01:18:02.666
competed to see who could
have sex with you first.

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:04.418
Annie texted me about it every night.

01:18:04.501 --> 01:18:06.378
- It's not what it sounds like.
- Really?

01:18:06.462 --> 01:18:10.507
We made a pact to go after
what each of us were missing,

01:18:10.591 --> 01:18:14.595
and without knowing it,
we all kind of decided it was you.

01:18:17.056 --> 01:18:20.225
And what was your thing, your pact?

01:18:21.268 --> 01:18:23.145
For my first time
to be with a man I love.

01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:27.399
- So that's why you went to see him.
- Yeah.

01:18:27.608 --> 01:18:29.944
She's only talking to you
because she caught me with another girl.

01:18:30.235 --> 01:18:31.487
You're just the fallback guy.

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:34.907
But, lucky for you,
I'm not into high school drama,

01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:37.242
so you want her, you can have her.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.662
- You know what?
- Whoa.

01:18:40.579 --> 01:18:42.122
Annie's not yours to give.

01:18:42.206 --> 01:18:44.667
And you say one more
disparaging word about her,

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:46.961
this high school kid
is gonna kick your ass.

01:18:47.294 --> 01:18:49.129
Just speaking my truth, bro.

01:18:49.213 --> 01:18:50.714
If she liked you
as much as you thought she did,

01:18:50.798 --> 01:18:53.884
would she be driving three hours
to have sex with me?

01:18:53.968 --> 01:18:56.011
No. You're just a piece of meat.

01:18:57.304 --> 01:18:58.347
Whoa! Hello!

01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:00.265
- My uncle's an attorney. He almost hit me.
- Shut up.

01:19:00.349 --> 01:19:01.350
No. Back. Break it up.

01:19:01.433 --> 01:19:02.601
I hope you guys are really happy.

01:19:02.685 --> 01:19:03.686
Look, Grant, we get that you're pissed...

01:19:03.769 --> 01:19:06.188
No, don't...
You paid Emmett to get dirt on me.

01:19:06.271 --> 01:19:07.272
Whoa. Uh...

01:19:07.564 --> 01:19:08.565
Don't.

01:19:09.274 --> 01:19:12.152
You know, every person
I liked in this town lied to me.

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:14.613
And the person I liked the most

01:19:14.905 --> 01:19:16.865
- chose this guy.
- Grant.

01:19:16.949 --> 01:19:19.785
- Enjoy the party.
- Please don't leave. Grant.

01:19:27.084 --> 01:19:29.586
<i>Why didn't you just tell us
what happened with Jason?</i>

01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:30.921
Yeah.

01:19:31.005 --> 01:19:32.589
I didn't know how to.

01:19:33.173 --> 01:19:35.175
You guys were all
so interested in Grant.

01:19:35.718 --> 01:19:37.136
I didn't wanna mess it up for you.

01:19:37.219 --> 01:19:39.179
Oh, my God. You should've just told us.

01:19:39.263 --> 01:19:40.723
Yeah, that's all
we would've needed, Annie.

01:19:40.806 --> 01:19:41.807
Yeah.

01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:44.560
I mean, you know,
this is my fault for pushing the pact.

01:19:44.643 --> 01:19:45.728
No.

01:19:45.811 --> 01:19:49.023
No, Steph. The pact worked.

01:19:49.106 --> 01:19:51.984
I mean, you found Emmett,
who's a nice guy.

01:19:52.067 --> 01:19:53.694
- He is.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:19:54.903 --> 01:19:57.364
And Kayla got Tim to compromise.

01:19:57.448 --> 01:19:59.700
Oh, my God. You're right.

01:20:00.909 --> 01:20:05.414
And, Michelle, are you as attracted
to Oliver's mind as you are to his body?

01:20:05.497 --> 01:20:10.544
Oh, he turns me on in ways
that I can't even describe.

01:20:10.628 --> 01:20:12.254
See? It worked.

01:20:13.047 --> 01:20:14.506
Yeah, for everyone but you.

01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:15.966
No, it worked for me, too.

01:20:17.343 --> 01:20:20.137
I went to Michigan State
with this image in my head,

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:25.267
and it all fell apart
because he was the wrong guy.

01:20:25.809 --> 01:20:28.854
And that's big, so I'm glad we did it.

01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:33.025
I mean, even if, you know,
I don't end up with Grant,

01:20:33.108 --> 01:20:34.818
I'm better than I was.

01:20:34.902 --> 01:20:35.903
Aw, come here.

01:20:35.986 --> 01:20:37.237
Aw.

01:20:37.571 --> 01:20:39.782
Little Virgin Annie.

01:20:39.865 --> 01:20:42.368
- With the unshuckable oyster.
- Shut up.

01:20:42.451 --> 01:20:45.621
I want in. Unshuckable oyster.

01:20:45.704 --> 01:20:47.623
Get in here, Stifler.

01:20:47.706 --> 01:20:49.416
Yeah, come on.

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.668
<i>Say what
What?</i>

01:20:50.751 --> 01:20:51.752
<i>Straight from the jump</i>

01:20:51.835 --> 01:20:53.337
<i>Right on the tempo
Mix it all up</i>

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.421
<i>Say hey
Hey</i>

01:20:54.505 --> 01:20:55.547
<i>{\an8}No time to wait</i>

01:20:55.631 --> 01:20:57.257
<i>{\an8}Taking your move
to a different place</i>

01:20:57.341 --> 01:20:58.342
<i>{\an8}Say hey
Hey</i>

01:20:58.425 --> 01:20:59.426
<i>{\an8}Do what it takes</i>

01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:01.011
<i>{\an8}Make like Tay 'n' shake</i>

01:21:01.095 --> 01:21:04.723
<i>Get up and go, go, go, go</i>

01:21:04.807 --> 01:21:08.644
<i>Get up and go, go, go, go</i>

01:21:08.727 --> 01:21:12.356
<i>Get up and go, go, go, go</i>

01:21:15.776 --> 01:21:18.028
- Light the fuse.
- Copy that.

01:21:19.071 --> 01:21:21.573
Mama Bear, Papa Bear,
Operation Oyster is a go.

01:21:55.274 --> 01:21:56.483
This guy.

01:21:57.985 --> 01:21:59.111
Hey.

01:21:59.778 --> 01:22:01.697
Annie's dad's outside with a limo.

01:22:02.531 --> 01:22:05.618
- What is that?
- It's a onesie, you moron.

01:22:05.701 --> 01:22:08.662
- For the pajama party.
- Why do you have it?

01:22:08.746 --> 01:22:10.456
Honey, you know
that I love you

01:22:10.539 --> 01:22:12.291
and I'm always gonna
tell you the truth, right?

01:22:13.042 --> 01:22:14.918
- I know.
- So the truth is,

01:22:15.419 --> 01:22:19.381
it's time for you to stop moping
because, baby, you're a real downer.

01:22:20.299 --> 01:22:22.926
Listen, happiness
doesn't just find us.

01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:25.262
You gotta go and you gotta grab it.

01:22:25.554 --> 01:22:26.597
Take this.

01:22:27.806 --> 01:22:29.683
- Take this.
- Okay.

01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:31.852
- I love you.
- What do I...

01:22:31.935 --> 01:22:33.395
You'll figure it out. Or not.

01:22:33.479 --> 01:22:35.397
I don't know.
I've done everything I can do.

01:22:42.613 --> 01:22:43.614
<i>Okay, this is your moment, Grant,</i>

01:22:43.697 --> 01:22:44.698
<i>- and you're blowing it.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

01:22:44.782 --> 01:22:46.992
<i>But luckily, Annie has some
pretty awesome friends...</i>

01:22:47.076 --> 01:22:48.077
<i>- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.</i>

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.079
<i>...who are trying to save you
from this terrible mistake.</i>

01:22:50.412 --> 01:22:51.705
<i>Plus, we think you're pretty great, too.</i>

01:22:51.789 --> 01:22:53.123
<i>And we sent you
a really cool onesie, so...</i>

01:22:53.207 --> 01:22:54.541
<i>Okay, just shut up!</i>

01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:55.668
<i>Game time, Grant.</i>

01:22:55.751 --> 01:22:56.752
<i>If you really like Annie,</i>

01:22:56.835 --> 01:22:58.337
<i>put on that onesie
and get in that fucking limo.</i>

01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.421
<i>- See you soon!
- If you don't do it...</i>

01:22:59.505 --> 01:23:00.506
<i>Gladiator!</i>

01:23:11.016 --> 01:23:14.186
Hey, asshole!
Turn off the music!

01:23:18.691 --> 01:23:22.736
<i>This day feels like
nothing but the right vibe</i>

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:26.657
<i>This could be the good life
Doesn't get better than...</i>

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:29.368
- Hi, darling!
- Hi.

01:23:30.369 --> 01:23:31.412
Are you okay?

01:23:32.204 --> 01:23:33.247
Not really.

01:23:34.206 --> 01:23:35.874
I just realized you were right.

01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:37.793
I've made sex too big a thing.

01:23:38.752 --> 01:23:40.337
I tried to turn it into some...

01:23:40.963 --> 01:23:43.465
It's for fairy tales. Stupid.

01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:46.969
No. No, honestly I think you were right
about wanting it to be special.

01:23:47.845 --> 01:23:50.347
Look, I never had
someone who gets me

01:23:50.681 --> 01:23:52.308
and cares for me, you know, and...

01:23:53.434 --> 01:23:55.144
But Emmett makes me feel
like that for the first time.

01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:57.396
Stop. Stop it.

01:23:57.479 --> 01:24:01.317
I mean, it's nice,
and I think tonight, we might, you know...

01:24:02.526 --> 01:24:05.029
Steph, that's great.

01:24:05.112 --> 01:24:06.572
Great? Doubtful.

01:24:08.991 --> 01:24:11.410
Special, yeah. Yeah.

01:24:11.493 --> 01:24:13.954
- Yeah. I'm happy for you.
- Thanks, babe.

01:24:15.497 --> 01:24:16.498
Oh, shit.

01:24:17.124 --> 01:24:19.209
Are you ready?

01:24:19.793 --> 01:24:22.004
- Uh, ready for what?
- Oh, you just wait, my darling.

01:24:22.838 --> 01:24:24.173
You're scaring me. What is...

01:24:24.256 --> 01:24:25.966
- Where are you...
- Just stay right there.

01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:30.095
<i>We're young and in love</i>

01:24:30.929 --> 01:24:32.514
<i>And we're running like the wind</i>

01:24:32.598 --> 01:24:34.016
<i>We got it all</i>

01:24:36.518 --> 01:24:37.895
<i>We're never alone</i>

01:24:37.978 --> 01:24:38.979
What?

01:24:39.063 --> 01:24:41.899
<i>If we got each other
we can save the world</i>

01:24:44.693 --> 01:24:48.530
<i>Explosions in the sky</i>

01:24:48.697 --> 01:24:51.909
<i>I see colors fly</i>

01:24:53.285 --> 01:24:54.954
<i>Old enough, old enough</i>

01:24:55.287 --> 01:24:57.998
<i>Old enough to know that
we are young in love</i>

01:24:58.082 --> 01:25:00.960
<i>Young in love
Young and in love</i>

01:25:01.293 --> 01:25:02.878
<i>You and me, we can see</i>

01:25:03.295 --> 01:25:04.505
<i>Time will stand still</i>

01:25:04.588 --> 01:25:06.173
<i>If we stay young in love</i>

01:25:06.256 --> 01:25:08.968
<i>Young in love
Young and in love</i>

01:25:09.593 --> 01:25:11.387
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:13.180
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:13.389 --> 01:25:15.182
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:16.642
You made it.

01:25:17.893 --> 01:25:19.269
You have some really great friends.

01:25:20.729 --> 01:25:21.981
Seems like we both do.

01:25:24.692 --> 01:25:28.153
<i>Old enough, old enough
Old enough to know that</i>

01:25:28.237 --> 01:25:29.405
<i>We are young in love</i>

01:25:29.488 --> 01:25:32.199
<i>Young in love
Young and in love</i>

01:25:32.616 --> 01:25:35.744
<i>You and me, we can see
Time will stand still</i>

01:25:35.828 --> 01:25:38.497
<i>If we stay young in love
Young in love</i>

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:40.124
I guess that's my cue.

01:25:42.001 --> 01:25:44.128
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:44.211 --> 01:25:46.130
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:46.213 --> 01:25:48.090
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:48.173 --> 01:25:50.217
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:50.301 --> 01:25:51.969
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:52.052 --> 01:25:54.054
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:55.889
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:55.973 --> 01:25:58.017
<i>Yeah, we are young and in love</i>

01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:59.101
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:25:59.184 --> 01:26:00.352
<i>Annie and Grant.</i>

01:26:06.317 --> 01:26:09.862
<i>Well, she was an American girl</i>

01:26:10.863 --> 01:26:13.198
<i>Raised on promises</i>

01:26:14.533 --> 01:26:17.369
<i>She couldn't help thinking that there</i>

01:26:17.453 --> 01:26:21.749
<i>Was a little more to life somewhere else</i>

01:26:22.499 --> 01:26:25.711
<i>After all, it was a great, big world</i>

01:26:26.462 --> 01:26:29.131
<i>With lots of places to run to</i>

01:26:30.215 --> 01:26:33.510
<i>Yeah, and if she had to die trying</i>

01:26:33.636 --> 01:26:38.724
<i>She had one little promise
she was gonna keep</i>

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:42.603
<i>Oh, yeah, all right</i>

01:26:43.103 --> 01:26:44.605
<i>Take it easy, baby</i>

01:26:45.064 --> 01:26:46.315
<i>Make it last all night</i>

01:26:47.483 --> 01:26:54.448
<i>She was an American girl</i>

01:26:55.616 --> 01:26:58.661
<i>Oh, yeah, all right</i>

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:00.871
<i>Take it easy, baby</i>

01:27:01.455 --> 01:27:02.915
<i>Make it last all night</i>

01:27:03.832 --> 01:27:09.755
<i>She was an American girl</i>

01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:16.720
What did you do?

01:27:16.804 --> 01:27:18.555
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, God.

01:27:21.725 --> 01:27:22.893
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

01:27:22.977 --> 01:27:24.144
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:27:24.228 --> 01:27:27.106
So, I... I guess they have
one more surprise for us.

01:27:28.399 --> 01:27:29.400
Okay.

01:27:29.775 --> 01:27:31.443
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:27:31.735 --> 01:27:33.445
What's happening right now?

01:27:37.157 --> 01:27:40.369
<i>I've fallen too deep</i>

01:27:40.452 --> 01:27:41.704
<i>Trying to swim</i>

01:27:41.787 --> 01:27:44.790
<i>The current too steep
and it's pulling me in</i>

01:27:45.207 --> 01:27:47.167
<i>I can breathe</i>

01:27:47.251 --> 01:27:51.755
<i>Both hands around my heart
My heart</i>

01:27:51.839 --> 01:27:54.675
<i>I can still feel the heat on your skin</i>

01:27:54.758 --> 01:27:58.095
<i>My lips are begging to pull you in</i>

01:27:58.178 --> 01:27:59.763
<i>I can breathe</i>

01:28:00.306 --> 01:28:04.310
<i>Your hands around my heart
My heart</i>

01:28:04.393 --> 01:28:05.394
<i>I'mma hold the door...</i>

01:28:05.477 --> 01:28:06.562
What?

01:28:08.147 --> 01:28:13.527
<i>For you there is no cure...</i>

01:28:15.404 --> 01:28:16.572
What are we, like...

01:28:16.905 --> 01:28:17.906
Oh.

01:28:18.282 --> 01:28:22.369
I made a pact, so I gotta stick to it.

01:28:23.370 --> 01:28:24.955
You want your first time
to be with me?

01:28:25.289 --> 01:28:28.709
Yeah. And the next few, I think.

01:28:38.594 --> 01:28:42.473
Hey. This feels special to me.

01:28:44.016 --> 01:28:45.267
Me, too, Annie.

01:28:48.854 --> 01:28:52.107
Oliver, I wanna share
something with you,

01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:54.276
something that I've never
shared with anyone else.

01:28:55.694 --> 01:28:56.695
Oh.

01:28:56.987 --> 01:28:58.197
You want me to use that on you?

01:28:59.865 --> 01:29:01.075
On me?

01:29:02.826 --> 01:29:05.329
And I want you right here, right now.

01:29:05.996 --> 01:29:07.122
On Principal Fisher's desk?

01:29:07.247 --> 01:29:09.375
- Yes, on her desk! Get up there!
- Okay. Okay.

01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:10.918
And I know you know what I want.

01:29:11.001 --> 01:29:15.047
You mean, "A man may die,
nations may rise and fall,

01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:17.007
- "but an idea lives on!"
- Yes.

01:29:17.091 --> 01:29:18.842
Yes!

01:29:19.134 --> 01:29:21.595
<i>And we dared to go</i>

01:29:22.888 --> 01:29:24.765
<i>A lover's bane</i>

01:29:25.099 --> 01:29:27.017
<i>Forever will remain...</i>

01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:29.812
Amazing. Shit.

01:29:30.145 --> 01:29:32.773
Wow. Shit!

01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:37.278
Thanks. Learned that at band camp.

01:29:37.361 --> 01:29:38.737
Yeah, I don't need to know that.

01:29:38.821 --> 01:29:41.282
Kiss me now. Okay?

01:29:42.032 --> 01:29:43.200
Now.

01:29:46.412 --> 01:29:47.621
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

01:29:47.705 --> 01:29:50.082
- I need to tell you something.
- What?

01:29:50.165 --> 01:29:51.667
I've... I've never done it.

01:29:52.167 --> 01:29:53.168
Me neither.

01:29:54.295 --> 01:29:56.463
I mean, I've never had it
with someone special, you know?

01:30:03.887 --> 01:30:05.055
{\an8}Oh.

01:30:05.514 --> 01:30:06.682
{\an8}Yes!

01:30:06.765 --> 01:30:07.808
Yeah?

01:30:10.019 --> 01:30:11.770
- You like this?
- Oh. Yeah.

01:30:11.854 --> 01:30:12.896
- This is hot.
- Yeah.

01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:14.064
- Dangerous.
- Yeah.

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:18.277
A little unsanitary, but, yeah.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.987
I like it here. I like you.

01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:21.113
I love you.

01:30:21.196 --> 01:30:25.034
You are my queen!

01:30:25.117 --> 01:30:28.037
I am your queen!

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.121
Whoo!

01:30:29.204 --> 01:30:30.581
<i>Ahoo</i>

01:30:30.664 --> 01:30:32.708
<i>Stars are falling</i>

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:36.295
<i>Are we falling, too?</i>

01:30:36.378 --> 01:30:40.841
<i>Ahoo, dawn is coming</i>

01:30:41.050 --> 01:30:44.470
<i>What's this coming to?</i>

01:30:44.553 --> 01:30:48.474
<i>On a night like this</i>

01:30:48.724 --> 01:30:52.227
<i>On a night like this...</i>

01:30:53.979 --> 01:30:56.357
- There's something else.
- What?

01:30:59.151 --> 01:31:00.402
Oh. Oh.

01:31:00.486 --> 01:31:01.820
No, don't worry if...

01:31:01.904 --> 01:31:05.282
Look, whatever's going down,
down there we'll make it work. Okay?

01:31:05.574 --> 01:31:06.909
- Yeah?
- I promise.

01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:09.078
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.001
Wow.

01:31:16.085 --> 01:31:18.128
Is your dad a giant?

01:31:18.212 --> 01:31:19.505
Like, will it fit?

01:31:19.672 --> 01:31:20.965
Here's to hoping.

01:31:22.257 --> 01:31:23.968
Oh, you're my president.

01:31:24.635 --> 01:31:25.886
You'll always be my president.

01:31:26.053 --> 01:31:28.180
<i>Ahoo</i>

01:31:28.263 --> 01:31:30.307
<i>Stars are falling</i>

01:31:30.391 --> 01:31:33.602
<i>Are we falling too?</i>

01:31:34.061 --> 01:31:37.523
<i>On a night like this</i>

01:31:38.065 --> 01:31:41.860
<i>On a night like this</i>

01:31:42.361 --> 01:31:46.323
<i>Ahoo</i>

01:35:09.401 --> 01:35:11.028
Say you want this
on your permanent record.

01:35:11.111 --> 01:35:12.738
I want this
on my permanent record.

01:35:12.821 --> 01:35:13.989
Yeah, you do.

01:35:14.073 --> 01:35:15.157
What's going on? Oh.

01:35:15.449 --> 01:35:18.243
Hey, Janitor Steve.
We'll just be a minute.

01:35:18.327 --> 01:35:19.536
Hi, Janitor Steve.

01:35:21.622 --> 01:35:23.040
I'm gonna need a bigger mop.

01:35:25.125 --> 01:35:26.418
<i>Don't touch me!</i>
