01:34.427 --> 01:37.055
Come on, let's do
another shot.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.565
Vince, I can't.
I've got a 10:00 AM meeting.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.658
If I miss it I can
kiss partner goodbye.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.636
- You'll call me?
- Definitely.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.071
- Partner?
- She's a lawyer.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.905
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but was that lawyer giving you a tug?

01:49.943 --> 01:52.309
In LA you can only
get an actress

01:52.345 --> 01:54.540
or a hooker
to do that.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.640
God, I love this
motherfucking town!

01:56.683 --> 01:58.844
Give me one of these.
Hear hear.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.226
Oh, man.

02:09.262 --> 02:12.322
- Should we get breakfast?
- No, we'll eat at home.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.799
- Train?
- Cab, please.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.358
I'm exhausted.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.767
Yeah, sitting in
a booth all night

02:17.804 --> 02:19.601
getting no pussy
can be draining.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.869
- Right here.
- Hey! Hey!

02:21.908 --> 02:23.500
Whoa whoa whoa!

02:24.644 --> 02:26.703
- Where to?
- Queens, please.

02:43.196 --> 02:46.324
Ow, you elbowed me
right in the face.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.857
Thanks a lot, man.
Good ride.

02:48.902 --> 02:52.303
Make sure that
cheap bastard tips you.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.499
Thank you.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.378
- I'm starving.
- I smell bacon.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.506
Ma, what are you
doing up?

03:02.549 --> 03:04.483
Well, sorry,
I couldn't sleep

03:04.517 --> 03:07.008
thinking of you all lying
in a ditch somewhere.

03:07.053 --> 03:09.613
We're grown men, Ma.
Nothing's gonna happen to us.

03:09.656 --> 03:12.056
Oh yeah?
You keep partying like this at your age

03:12.091 --> 03:14.525
you're gonna have
a heart attack, Johnny.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.721
It's true.
She's right.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.559
And you go home.
Your mother's worried too.

03:17.597 --> 03:20.395
- I can't stay for breakfast?
- What, she doesn't cook for you anymore?

03:20.433 --> 03:22.424
Sadly my mom's cooking
has gone to shit.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.959
- And it started at crap.
- Be nice to your mother, Turtle.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.835
That's easy for you to say.
Your mom's in Florida.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.068
- Turtle!
- It's like she can smell me.

03:29.108 --> 03:30.905
I saw your cab pull up.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.071
What kind of an animal
doesn't come home till sunrise?

03:33.112 --> 03:35.740
- Four nights in a row.
- We're on vacation, Ma.

03:35.782 --> 03:38.182
Get your fat ass home.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.584
- Right now.
- I'm coming.

03:40.620 --> 03:44.021
- Get your fat ass home, Turtle.
- Shut up, Drama.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.581
You okay, Ma?

03:45.625 --> 03:47.650
I'm worried about you.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.263
You party all night,
you sleep all day.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.424
How are you gonna get a job
carrying on like that?

03:53.466 --> 03:55.434
It's always
worked before.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.935
I'm okay, Ma.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.941
Is he?

04:01.975 --> 04:04.705
Is he okay?
You're the mastermind behind all this.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.644
- You tell me.
- Yeah, well...

04:06.679 --> 04:08.544
we've hit a bit of a rough
patch, but we'll be okay.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.879
You know, I read in
"The Post" this morning

04:10.917 --> 04:14.080
that Gus Van Sant is in town
working on a new movie.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.417
- Ma.
- What?

04:15.455 --> 04:17.548
I thought "Good Will Hunting"
was very good.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.750
I would love to be
in a Gus Van Sant movie,

04:19.791 --> 04:22.124
but I have an agent and a manager
who are on top of these things.

04:22.161 --> 04:23.594
Are you on top
of this thing?

04:23.630 --> 04:26.121
I read the script months ago
when Vince wasn't available.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.725
- It's totally cast now.
- Not anymore.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.202
Joaquin Phoenix
broke his arm

04:31.237 --> 04:34.070
and Gus is looking
for a replacement.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.631
I would love
to work with Gus.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.233
"Milk" was dope.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.212
It's a great role.
I'll call Ari.

04:40.246 --> 04:41.941
Maybe I'm not
so useless after all.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.318
Gus doesn't think
he's right for it.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.117
- How do you know?
- Because unlike you

04:50.156 --> 04:52.647
my workday starts before
reading Page Six.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.421
- What's he saying?
- He spoke to Gus.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.621
He doesn't think you're
right for the part. Hold on.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.525
- Yo.
- Vinnie, how goes it?

05:00.566 --> 05:02.557
Not well.
My mom's all over me.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.160
She's treating me like
she usually treats Johnny.

05:04.203 --> 05:05.830
I'm sorry
about that, buddy.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.601
So what exactly
did Gus say?

05:07.640 --> 05:10.165
Listen, Gus says he loves
you but just not for this.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.473
All right, what did he
really say?

05:12.512 --> 05:14.571
He's not a fan.

05:14.614 --> 05:16.912
He's not a fan.

05:16.949 --> 05:19.144
Tell him
you'll read for it.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.380
- Really?
- Yeah, you'll make him a fan.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.116
What's the idiot saying?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.487
He thinks I should read.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.287
Vinnie, you haven't
auditioned in years.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.987
So what?
You don't think I can?

05:28.027 --> 05:29.995
- Vince.
- I'm not afraid to audition, Ari.

05:30.029 --> 05:31.656
I can turn him.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.633
I like the fire.
I'll set it up.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.464
Great.
Thanks.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.198
Back to basics.

05:39.238 --> 05:42.605
I can give you plenty
of advice on how to audition, bro.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.110
He needs advice on how
to successfully audition.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.475
Yo, Vinnie Chase!

05:46.512 --> 05:48.241
I've booked my fair share
of jobs, you jerkoff.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.578
Including this one
right here.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.674
One in a million's not
the odds we're looking for.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.879
Vince knows how to audition.
He had to start somewhere.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.512
Guys, I don't want
to talk about it.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.250
Let's just go say hi
to Aunt Darcy for Ma

05:57.290 --> 05:59.383
and then we'll hit Don Pepe's
for some baked clams, okay?

05:59.425 --> 06:02.019
You can't just say hi
to Aunt Darcy.

06:03.262 --> 06:05.730
Welcome home!

06:05.765 --> 06:08.029
Oh my God.
Ma, how did you beat us here?

06:08.067 --> 06:09.967
I'm sneaky like that.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.868
So how's it feel
to be back home?

06:13.906 --> 06:16.204
Are you kidding? I always love coming
home and seeing everybody.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.334
We're all so proud of you.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.813
Even when your movies get shit reviews,
we're still proud, Vinnie.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.576
- Hey, that's not nice.
- Would you excuse me for a second?

06:22.615 --> 06:25.345
So when are we gonna see
you in another good movie?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.410
- Soon, I hope.
- Very soon.

06:27.453 --> 06:30.752
Let's just say he may be
starring in Gus Van Sant's new movie.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.018
Oh, nice.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.616
Hey, Drama, you gonna
be in that movie too?

06:33.659 --> 06:35.923
The closest he's getting
to Gus Van Sant

06:35.962 --> 06:37.589
is whacking it to
"My Own Private Idaho."

06:37.630 --> 06:39.689
Hey, Turtle, watch that mouth
or I'll wash it out with Palmolive.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.632
- Would you stop?
- Hear hear, shut up.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.965
- And get off that thing. You're at a party.
- What?

06:44.003 --> 06:46.369
- Seriously, who do you keep texting with?
- Nobody.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.931
I'm gonna get some air.
You guys are crazy.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.909
He won't even
let him audition?

06:50.943 --> 06:53.707
He said he doesn't want
to waste anyone's time.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.771
Jesus, I don't even know
how to tell Vince that.

06:55.815 --> 06:58.249
You knew how to tell him
to read before checking with me.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.115
Ari, you've got to get Gus
to do you a favor and see him.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.213
A favor to cover up your
fuck up or a favor for Vince?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.518
For Vince.
He needs this right now.

07:04.557 --> 07:05.956
He might not be showing it,
but he's hurting.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.358
That sucks, but there are
certain realities

07:08.394 --> 07:10.225
we need to face up to
in this life.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.198
And one of them is that Vince
ain't getting in a Gus Van Sant movie.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.757
Will you call Gus back?

07:15.802 --> 07:18.635
- No, I won't.
- Fine, then I fucking will.

07:18.671 --> 07:21.435
- Leave me alone.
- Who you talking to?

07:21.474 --> 07:22.873
Hey, Johnny, maybe it's a girl.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.308
- Impossible.
- Why?

07:24.343 --> 07:25.833
We all want to know who
you're talking to, Turtle.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.368
But I will give it to
the highest bidder.

07:27.413 --> 07:28.937
- 50 bucks.
- Give me the Berry, Ronnie.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.142
- Sold.
- Give it to me.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.776
He deleted everything.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.912
You don't think I know
how to cover my tracks?

07:34.954 --> 07:36.512
Hey, you still
owe me 50.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.786
Take it off my tab from the last time
you lost me money.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.487
You still can't be mad.
I got opportunities for you, Drama.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.325
- I'm not even hearing you, Ronnie.
- We'll talk tonight.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.957
Can I get a rum and Coke?

07:46.999 --> 07:49.024
Well, look who it is.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.696
You didn't think I'd miss the
one-who-got-away's homecoming parade.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.432
I'm glad you didn't.
How are you doing, Cara?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.373
I'm good.
How are you?

07:55.408 --> 07:57.273
I-I'm great.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.073
Hey, Cara.
How you been?

07:59.111 --> 08:01.238
Great.
Really great now that I can get

08:01.280 --> 08:03.976
my once-every-five-years
update on how my old crew is doing.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.381
What did Ari say?

08:05.418 --> 08:07.386
- You want to...
- That's okay.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.882
Gus won't see you.

08:11.924 --> 08:14.415
He won't even
let me read?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.553
Wow.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.827
All right,
fuck Hollywood.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.061
You know what?
Let's go have some old school fun.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.467
You guys go. I'm gonna go into
the city and see Gus.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.994
- E, come on.
- What?

08:26.038 --> 08:28.268
You just gonna go knock on his door
and beg him to let me audition?

08:28.307 --> 08:29.638
I tried calling him.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.972
If Ari couldn't do it,
forget it.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.307
Do you want to do
this movie or not, Vince?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.835
I did this morning,
but this is stupid.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.780
Well, let me try.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.215
- Okay, try.
- Thank you.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.378
I'll see you guys later. Have fun.
It was good to see you, Cara.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.546
Bye, E.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.120
- Mr. Murphy.
- Hi.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.719
Hi. Shawn, we spoke
on the phone.

08:50.763 --> 08:52.697
Yeah, hey.
Is Gus around?

08:52.732 --> 08:55.166
Well, as I told you
on the phone,

08:55.201 --> 08:57.499
Mr. Van Sant doesn't have time
to talk with you today. So sorry.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.131
I totally understand.
Actually, I don't even need to talk.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.936
I just wanted to give him these
Vincent Chase movies to look at.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.068
- I picked these up.
- Sure, I'll give them to him.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.238
Actually, do you think I can
give them to him personally?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.578
Um, he's not in right now
and he might not be back for hours.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.708
You know what?
That's okay.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.548
I don't mind waiting.
I won't bother anyone, I promise.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.884
- Great.
- Thanks.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.457
You know I got fired
off my last movie?

09:23.496 --> 09:25.361
I know.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.593
- Who told you?
- "Us Weekly."

09:27.633 --> 09:29.794
You read "Us Weekly"?

09:29.835 --> 09:31.666
A future MBA?

09:31.704 --> 09:33.831
God, that is so sad.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.673
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

09:38.711 --> 09:41.942
I just know I can't take
another year like this.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.608
What does E say?

09:43.649 --> 09:45.207
E?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.878
E says a lot of things.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.887
I just don't know who
I should listen to anymore.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.980
Just listen
to yourself.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.256
So this is the guy
who doesn't believe in appointments?

09:57.296 --> 09:58.957
Mr. Van Sant, how are you?
Eric Murphy.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.761
Look, I'm sorry to drop
in on you like this,

10:00.800 --> 10:02.631
but if I could just have
five minutes of your time.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.499
Walk with me, but only
'cause Ari's a friend.

10:07.306 --> 10:10.173
So what didn't I make clear to Ari
that I should make clear to you now?

10:10.209 --> 10:11.972
Well, nothing, but I know Vince
can do this part.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.138
And I know he can't,
so where does that leave us?

10:14.180 --> 10:16.614
I think that if you just looked at
some of his work you'd see it.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.048
- I've seen all of his work.
- Probably not all of it.

10:18.818 --> 10:20.308
- You've seen "Head On"?
- Yup, saw it.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.980
Well, what about
"Queen's Boulevard"?

10:22.021 --> 10:24.012
Not a lot of people saw that but it was
an amazing performance.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.956
At Sundance the "New York Times"
said he might win an Oscar.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.256
- But he didn't.
- No, he didn't.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.921
- And I saw it.
- What about "Aquaman"?

10:29.962 --> 10:32.362
Everyone saw "Aquaman"
and I see everything.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.922
What about the scenes from
the last movie he just shot?

10:33.966 --> 10:35.900
"Smokejumpers."
I know you didn't see those.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.995
So you're gonna sell me on Vince
based on a $120 million film

10:39.038 --> 10:41.598
that was shut down because
the director didn't like his work?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.632
Look, I know
he can do this.

10:43.676 --> 10:46.440
Please, just take a look
at the scenes.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.572
So you're kind of
desperate, huh?

10:48.614 --> 10:50.844
Yeah, well, it doesn't
mean I'm wrong.

10:50.883 --> 10:53.875
Okay, send over some scenes.
I'll take a look.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.293
Thank you.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.261
Thank you very much.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.692
- You really are an idiot, E.
- Ari.

11:08.734 --> 11:12.101
Say it out loud:
"I am a fucking idiot."

11:12.138 --> 11:13.628
Just call Dana Gordon.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.436
Yo, watch out, man.
What's up?

11:15.474 --> 11:16.964
Have her overnight them.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.103
It's an unreleased disaster.
She'll never let them out.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.114
You got her the job.
You could get her to do it.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.013
I don't want to
get her to do it.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.540
All right, fine.
You know what, Ari?

11:25.584 --> 11:26.949
You call Gus
and you tell him that,

11:26.986 --> 11:29.614
'cause he rearranged his whole
schedule to be there

11:29.655 --> 11:31.350
when they arrive and I told
him you were sending them.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.984
Fuck!

11:38.197 --> 11:40.791
I'm not investing
in a bar, Ronnie.

11:40.833 --> 11:44.234
Think of it this way: You'll be investing
in the old neighborhood, huh?

11:44.270 --> 11:46.898
TV star makes good, huh?

11:46.939 --> 11:50.568
Come on, Drama. Think about all
the great times we've had in this place.

11:50.609 --> 11:53.976
'94, game six,
John Starks.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.844
Come on, you remember.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.543
I do, I do. And I remember coming
here trying to forget game seven.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.575
This place is still
packed every night.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.587
So how did Philly
fall so behind?

12:02.621 --> 12:03.883
He's a degenerate gambler.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.823
So why would I want
to invest with him?

12:05.858 --> 12:07.553
He's in the program now.

12:07.593 --> 12:10.221
30 Gs and he's back
on his feet.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.924
- He won't make the same mistake again.
- Ronnie, forget it.

12:12.965 --> 12:15.399
Like my last investment with you,
I'll never see my money again.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.026
- Maybe you wouldn't.
- Right.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.264
But I think Philly might
let you change the name.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.836
Vince.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.473
- What's up, buddy?
- Long day?

12:29.515 --> 12:32.416
Yeah. I waited in Gus's office
for six hours today.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.941
Des he still hate me?

12:33.986 --> 12:35.453
Well, he definitely
hates me.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.217
Is he gonna let me
read or what?

12:37.256 --> 12:39.019
He's gonna watch
the "Smokejumpers" footage tomorrow.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.822
Ari got Dana Gordon to FedEx it to him,
so we still got a shot.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.954
- Not a very good one.
- Yeah, but it's still a shot.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.261
Excuse me, buddy.

12:46.298 --> 12:48.630
- Jesus, Turtle.
- Sorry, I've got to take...

12:50.836 --> 12:53.396
We want to know
who you're talking to.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.236
Give me the phone,
Drama.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.072
Come on, Turtle.
Enough's enough. Who is it?

12:58.110 --> 13:00.374
Vince, please don't
make me tell you.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.243
Just give me
the phone back, please.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.908
Oh no no no.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.117
- Turtle's phone.
- Hello? Who's this?

13:08.154 --> 13:10.486
- Ooh, it's a girl.
- His mother?

13:10.523 --> 13:13.583
- Hello?
- Can I tell Turtle who's calling?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.890
It's Jamie, Drama.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.759
Really?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.560
Are you guys giving
Turtle a hard time?

13:19.598 --> 13:21.657
No no no.
It's all in good fun.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.327
Whatever.
We're fucking.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.530
So can I please
just talk to him?

13:25.571 --> 13:27.436
Yeah yeah.
Of course.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.271
It's Jamie-Lynn.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.834
They're fucking and I'm gonna jump off
the Triborough Bridge.

13:35.247 --> 13:37.647
Hey, sorry about that.
They stole my phone.

13:37.683 --> 13:40.516
Babe, relax.
I don't care.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.487
I just miss you.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.648
She misses me.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.022
I miss you too.

13:47.059 --> 13:48.253
Phone sex?

13:49.795 --> 13:51.888
I'll go outside.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.796
- Wow.
- Seriously.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.028
All right, come on.
Who's Jamie-Lynn?

13:56.068 --> 13:57.763
- Sigler from "The Sopranos."
- Meadow Soprano.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.168
Oh, wow.

13:59.205 --> 14:02.368
Well, bro, if Turtle
can land Jamie-Lynn,

14:02.408 --> 14:04.672
there's no reason you can't
get a Gus Van Sant movie.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.541
I just hope
he lets me read.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.513
There's nothing to hope.
He will.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.209
And, Ronnie,
you tell Phil

14:11.250 --> 14:14.344
that if this place is henceforth
known as Johnny Drama's,

14:14.386 --> 14:16.479
- I'm in.
- Yeah?

14:16.522 --> 14:19.855
Yeah. Hey, everyone,
I got an announcement to make.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.690
The drinks are on me.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.787
Or should I say,

14:24.830 --> 14:26.559
the drinks are on...

14:26.599 --> 14:29.090
the house.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.701
Show me the bar, let's go.

14:33.739 --> 14:36.299
How you doing?
Get this guy a drink.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.877
The life of an actor...

14:42.915 --> 14:44.746
waiting around for
the phone to ring.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.547
Something kind of exciting
about it, you know?

14:47.586 --> 14:49.110
- No.
- No.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.179
Pussys.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.588
Get out of
my kitchen, Johnny.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.320
I'm making
my famous frittatas.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.487
No, I'm nervous. And when I'm nervous
I have to stay busy,

14:56.528 --> 14:58.894
- Any calls?
- No, nothing yet.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.296
- Relax, Ma.
- Look...

15:00.332 --> 15:02.323
some of us are not used
to this kind of thing.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.235
My God, I always thought it was you
I was gonna have to worry about.

15:05.271 --> 15:08.297
- Never Vince.
- He'll be fine, Ma. Don't worry.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.535
Morning, Mrs. Chase.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.908
Oh, well,
what have we here?

15:12.945 --> 15:16.346
This is like
old times, huh?

15:16.382 --> 15:18.282
E, any calls?

15:18.317 --> 15:21.013
- Hey, don't even ask. Don't even ask.
- Sorry.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.613
Well, now that you did...

15:23.656 --> 15:26.557
- Nothing yet.
- Did you track the package?

15:26.592 --> 15:29.083
- Are you even sure he got the movie?
- They're called dailies, Ma.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.925
All right, whatever they're called,
are you sure he got them?

15:30.963 --> 15:32.760
- Did you track the package?
- I tracked them.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.130
I tracked them.
He definitely got them. Jeez.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.896
Let's just focus
on something else, guys.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.200
Like what?

15:39.238 --> 15:40.865
Turtle's got a girlfriend.

15:40.906 --> 15:42.874
No.
Who is she?

15:42.908 --> 15:46.207
Jamie-Lynn Sigler
from "The Sopranos."

15:46.245 --> 15:49.476
- Oh come on.
- Ha! That's why you're my ma.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.949
One day you're all
gonna believe in me.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.508
Oh God!

15:53.552 --> 15:55.918
- Ma, just relax.
- It's cute.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.286
- It's a 212 number.
- Pick it up.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.154
- Come on.
- Hello?

15:59.191 --> 16:02.422
- Hey, Eric, what's up?
- Hey, Gus. Did you get the stuff?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.292
I did.
I really liked it.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.922
Is there a way to talk
to Vince about it?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.296
Uh, yeah.
He's right here.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.426
Put it on speaker.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.062
Ma, just chill.

16:12.104 --> 16:15.005
Hey, Gus.
How you doing?

16:15.040 --> 16:18.635
Hey, Vince, I'm really glad your crazy
manager got you back on our radar.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.611
- Oh yeah?
- He's a pushy one.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.477
Yeah, he is.

16:22.514 --> 16:25.278
Anyway, I watched your stuff
and I really thought it was great.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.751
You're definitely growing
and definitely have something.

16:27.786 --> 16:29.981
Just not for this movie.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.384
Yeah, no.
I understand.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.394
But we should work
together in the future. I mean that.

16:36.428 --> 16:39.056
Thank you.
Bye.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.429
What did he say?

16:44.470 --> 16:46.335
He said I'm on his radar

16:46.372 --> 16:48.499
and we'll work together,
just not on this one.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.940
All right,
all right.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.375
At least he appreciates
how good you are.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.639
Yeah.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.271
That's cool, bro.
You'll get the next one.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.407
- Fuck!
- Vincent!

16:57.449 --> 16:59.246
Sorry.

16:59.284 --> 17:00.876
Sorry, l...

17:00.919 --> 17:02.443
I just need to go
for a walk.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.046
- I got it.
- I'll be back.

17:07.092 --> 17:10.185
Vince.
Vince.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.196
I really don't want to talk
about this right now, E.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.290
We're gonna be all right.
We jut did a lead.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.300
Things didn't go as we planned,
but everything's gonna be fine.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.234
You sure?
You're always so fucking sure.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.101
- How do you really know?
- I just do.

17:20.138 --> 17:21.935
Yeah?
Just like you knew about this?

17:21.973 --> 17:24.670
Ari told you no
and you kept pushing.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.042
And now not only did you embarrass
yourself, you embarrassed me.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.514
Embarrassed you?
Gus Van Sant likes you now.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.073
You believe him?
Come on.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.482
He won't even
let me audition.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.077
Who knows if he even
watched the footage?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.610
- Vince.
- No, this year we said...

17:36.655 --> 17:38.179
we swore we were gonna
listen to Ari.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.690
And guess what?
Again you didn't.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.216
What am I supposed to do?
Do nothing and stand by

17:42.261 --> 17:44.229
- and hope something magically appears?
- Yeah, maybe.

17:44.263 --> 17:45.821
'Cause since you've
been my manager,

17:45.864 --> 17:47.593
everything you've pushed for
has gotten me to this point.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.693
Are you serious?
I've been the one working

17:50.736 --> 17:52.465
for you to get you what you
want when no one else cared.

17:52.504 --> 17:54.131
Yeah, well maybe that's
what I needed,

17:54.173 --> 17:56.004
someone looking out for my career,
not my personal interests.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.271
- I was doing both.
- Well, whatever it is you were doing

17:58.310 --> 18:00.904
clearly isn't working.
Two years ago I was starring in movies.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.277
Now people won't even
let me audition.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.282
One person won't let
you audition.

18:04.316 --> 18:05.943
You have to stay positive,
Vince, you know that.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.212
Are you serious?

18:07.252 --> 18:09.311
I have done nothing
but stay positive.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.413
I have listened to everything
you've wanted me to do.

18:11.457 --> 18:12.981
And now I got a house
full of people

18:13.025 --> 18:14.959
who can really see what
a failure I've turned into.

18:14.993 --> 18:16.517
- Vince, come on.
- No.

18:16.562 --> 18:18.086
We said when we
started this

18:18.130 --> 18:19.995
is was gonna be about the business,
not the friendship.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.227
It's time
for a change, E.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.292
You firing me?

18:24.336 --> 18:26.099
The business isn't
working, is it?

18:26.138 --> 18:28.368
Whatever.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.602
I'm not gonna grovel.
Go find someone better.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.803
'Cause I can live with myself
knowing I busted my ass

18:32.845 --> 18:33.903
and I gave everything I had to you.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.107
I know you did, E.
But it wasn't enough.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.843
Yeah, fuck you.

18:47.593 --> 18:47.693
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:47.693 --> 18:48.921
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:48.961 --> 18:51.759
welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.358
Please make sure that all
baggage is not left unattended.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.105
Drama's.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.081
- Johnny Drama's.
- Yeah.

19:10.115 --> 19:12.310
I love it.
I love it.

19:12.351 --> 19:15.912
Yo, E.
It's me again.

19:15.954 --> 19:18.889
Look, I don't want this
to affect our friendship.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.449
Nothing is more important
to me than that.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.427
Call me.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.660
Are you wet?

19:26.698 --> 19:30.031
I'm wet and your big cock
is in my mouth.

19:30.068 --> 19:32.593
That's where my big cock
likes to be.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.401
- Turtle!
- Ma?

19:34.439 --> 19:36.373
Who are you talking to
like that in my house?

19:36.408 --> 19:38.205
Your father would roll over
in his grave.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.074
Jamie, I've got to
call you back later.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.205
Off the phone now!

19:42.247 --> 19:44.306
- Fuck.
- God damn it!

19:45.918 --> 19:48.079
- E, you're late.
- Everything's fine.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.553
You're nervous.
You ready to go?

19:49.588 --> 19:51.613
Yeah, I'm psyched to blow
these network freaks away.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.784
Yeah? You gonna blow
Jimmy Kimmel away?

19:53.825 --> 19:56.692
- What do you mean?
- Just got off the phone with his people.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.094
They want you to do a little standup
on the show to plug the pilot.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.122
- That cool?
- Yeah, boy, it is. What?

20:01.166 --> 20:02.997
All right, let's do this.

20:04.603 --> 20:06.230
- You wanna get that, man?
- No.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.603
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey hey.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.537
- All right.
- You can just keep that. Thank you.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.083
Okay, Lloyd,
get him on the phone now.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.326
Jesus, is this what you call
a New York vacation?

20:35.367 --> 20:37.597
Where's the glamour?
Where's the bitches?

20:37.636 --> 20:40.298
- Look who's here.
- Welcome to Johnny Drama's.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.204
This must be Ari.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.004
Ari, Cara;
Cara, Ari.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.567
I apologize. I was talking about
these bitches, not you.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.375
Ari, let me get you
a beer, huh?

20:48.413 --> 20:50.540
Just make it a quick one
'cause I got a big meeting tomorrow.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.847
Look at you. It's good to see you.
Nice of you to drop by.

20:53.885 --> 20:56.285
Actually, I've got a little bit
of business as well, Vinnie.

20:56.321 --> 20:57.913
Oh yeah?
What's going on?

20:57.956 --> 21:00.584
It's right here.
Lloyd, you got him?

21:00.626 --> 21:02.685
Indeed I do.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.457
Here's Vinnie.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.428
- Hello?
- Hello, Vince?

21:10.469 --> 21:12.027
Hey, it's Marty Scorsese.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.504
Hi.
Hello.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.302
Yeah, listen,
you got a minute to talk?

21:16.341 --> 21:20.277
Uh, yeah.
Indeed I do.

21:20.312 --> 21:23.372
Okay, well look, Gus was kind enough
to send me some of the rushes

21:23.415 --> 21:25.406
in that picture you were in
about the forest fires or whatever.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.611
And I saw them and I thought
you were terrific.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.917
And I'd love to offer you
a part in my new picture.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.445
- Really?
- Yeah,

21:31.490 --> 21:33.651
it's a reimagining
of "The Great Gatsby,"

21:33.692 --> 21:36.593
modern day set in
the Upper West Side of New York.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.256
And I think you'd be perfect
for Nick Carraway.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.324
- What do you think of that?
- Um, amazing.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.301
Great. If you'd like to come in
and talk about the details...

21:44.336 --> 21:46.600
- Okay.
- Okay, see you soon then.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.970
- All right, thank you. Thank you.
- Bye.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.176
Uh, I'm gonna be in
a Scorsese movie.

21:54.212 --> 21:56.407
Correction.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.678
You're gonna be the lead
in a fucking Scorsese film.

21:58.717 --> 22:00.810
You talkin' to me?

22:00.852 --> 22:03.446
That's my De Niro.
No good?

22:03.488 --> 22:05.786
This is unreal!

22:05.824 --> 22:07.155
Look at that.
Young love, huh?

22:07.192 --> 22:09.251
And it shoot in New York
as well, if that helps.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.159
Nice.

22:11.196 --> 22:13.061
Thank you, Ari.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.089
- Thank you.
- You know what? Don't thank me,

22:15.133 --> 22:17.124
Thank E.
For once in his life

22:17.169 --> 22:18.534
the little McNugget
delivered.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.936
Where is the little
freak anyway?

22:24.176 --> 22:26.235
Hey look, it's not flashy,
all right?

22:26.278 --> 22:28.007
- But it rides nice.
- And it's practical.

22:28.046 --> 22:29.946
- Still kind of cool.
- Very cool.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.284
If the pilot gets picked
up I'm getting a Porsche.

22:33.318 --> 22:35.718
It will get picked up.
But wait till season two

22:35.754 --> 22:37.654
gets the go ahead before
you get the Porsche, okay?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.247
- You got it.
- See you, Charlie.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.885
Hey, E.
Thanks for everything.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.828
You're welcome, buddy.

22:49.267 --> 22:50.996
Hey, Jane.
Any calls?

22:51.036 --> 22:54.369
No, but there's a pretty package
waiting inside for you.

22:58.777 --> 23:00.506
You just gonna keep
ignoring my calls?

23:00.545 --> 23:02.843
- I wasn't ignoring them.
- I saw you through the window.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.678
Well, my phone is broken.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.843
What are you doing here?

23:06.885 --> 23:08.978
Well, since you wouldn't
answer the phone,

23:09.020 --> 23:11.318
I flew in to apologize
personally.

23:11.356 --> 23:13.415
Oh, wow.
I appreciate that.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.585
I said some things...

23:15.627 --> 23:18.221
I was really feeling
awful about myself

23:18.263 --> 23:19.753
and I took it out on you.

23:19.798 --> 23:22.164
Do you accept
my apology?

23:22.200 --> 23:23.895
Yeah, I do.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.597
Any chance you might
be my manager again?

23:26.638 --> 23:29.106
I don't know
about that, Vince.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.336
I think maybe some
of the things you said were right.

23:31.376 --> 23:33.742
I did fuck some things up

23:33.779 --> 23:35.246
and I guess I got in
Ari's way a little bit.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.612
I'm okay with that now.

23:37.649 --> 23:39.810
I got some things going on
and you will too.

23:39.851 --> 23:41.614
I got something
going on:

23:43.288 --> 23:45.882
The lead in Scorsese's
next movie.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.722
What?
How?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.625
Good management.

23:50.662 --> 23:52.186
You in?

23:52.230 --> 23:54.528
Come on, I don't want to do
this without my brother.

23:56.301 --> 23:58.769
Yeah, I'm in.
Scorsese?

23:58.804 --> 24:00.772
That's crazy.
Congratulations.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.740
Thank God. That scene was getting
way to gay for my tastes.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.237
We missed you, E.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.712
- Turtle.
- How are you, man?

24:11.917 --> 24:13.817
Let's go get wasted.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.581
- Let's do it.
- I like it.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.087
Where to?
Where to?

24:21.927 --> 24:24.760
You guys ready for what's coming?
It's gonna be big.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.320
I've been ready
for a long time.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.229
But don't worry.
I won't let it go to my head.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.166
I just put you in
a Scorsese movie.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.692
I might let it
go to mine.

24:31.736 --> 24:34.432
Your Oscar's gonna look great
right next to my Emmy, bro.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.907
- Let's not get greedy.
- Come on, let's.

24:36.942 --> 24:38.273
Reach for
the stars, baby.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.006
- Yeah!
- You know it.
