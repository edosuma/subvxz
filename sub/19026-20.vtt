00:02.458 --> 00:05.083
(J.D.) <i>You never know who you're</i>
<i>gonna find in the cafeteria at 5 A.M.</i>

00:05.166 --> 00:07.000
<i>It could be the husband</i>
<i>who asked his wife,</i>

00:07.083 --> 00:10.500
<i>after thirty-six hours of labor, if</i>
<i>the screaming was really necessary</i>

00:10.583 --> 00:13.291
<i>or the intern who's been on-call</i>
<i>so many nights in a row,</i>

00:13.375 --> 00:15.291
<i>she's actually hallucinating.</i>

00:15.375 --> 00:18.875
Hi. I'd like two tickets
to<i> Million Dollar Baby.</i>

00:18.959 --> 00:21.458
(J.D.) <i>Or your best friends who</i>
<i>have found time between shifts</i>

00:21.542 --> 00:23.500
<i>to discuss their marital troubles.</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:25.417
Why can't Carla just let this go?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.542
Wouldn't you be mad
if you caught your husband

00:27.625 --> 00:28.542
talking to his ex-girlfriend?

00:28.625 --> 00:31.458
Yeah, but mostly
because I had a husband.

00:32.041 --> 00:34.417
I'm gonna stay at Elliot's
for a few more days.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.625
Yeah, I figured as much.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.709
I brought you some things.

00:38.792 --> 00:43.458
Your slippers and, uh...

00:44.583 --> 00:47.166
Remember that note you put
on the toilet to remind me

00:47.250 --> 00:49.375
to put the seat down?

00:49.458 --> 00:51.291
Looking at it
was making me sad.

00:51.875 --> 00:54.125
I wrote this the first time
I forgot to look down

00:54.208 --> 00:55.792
and fractured my tailbone.

00:55.875 --> 00:58.667
-You were in a lot of pain.
-Yeah. Ha, ha!

00:58.750 --> 01:01.000
-(sighs)
-Keep it together, baby.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.125
We'll have brunch on Sunday and
then we'll see where we're at.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.041
But I want to be where you're at

01:05.125 --> 01:08.375
while we're trying to figure out
where we're at.

01:08.458 --> 01:09.375
(sighs)

01:09.458 --> 01:12.333
-Think they'll work it out?
-Shh!

01:12.417 --> 01:15.917
-The movie's about to start.
-Go home, Kathy.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.417
Where did she get popcorn?

01:20.750 --> 01:22.208
(J.D.) <i>Maybe it's because</i>
<i>we're best friends,</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:24.959
<i>but I had a sneaky feeling</i>
<i>that Turk was depressed.</i>

01:26.333 --> 01:28.375
I should call her.

01:28.458 --> 01:30.583
Turk, you're not
gonna believe this,

01:30.667 --> 01:32.083
but I don't know
a lot about women.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.750
No, it's true.
The one thing I do know

01:35.834 --> 01:38.333
is when a woman wants her space,
you give her space.

01:38.417 --> 01:40.959
My sixth grade girlfriend
taught me that.

01:41.041 --> 01:44.125
No, Olivia. I won't leave you alone
until you explain

01:44.208 --> 01:45.875
why you ignored me on the bus.

01:46.709 --> 01:49.208
Uhh!

01:49.834 --> 01:51.500
I hope she's dead.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.000
The point is, in the meantime,
it's important

01:53.083 --> 01:54.792
you don't spiral into
a depression, ok?

01:54.875 --> 01:58.333
So I'm taking you to a carnival
downtown tonight. What do you say?

01:58.417 --> 02:01.041
I can't go to a carnival.
It reminds me of Carla.

02:01.125 --> 02:03.583
-Why?
-Dude, "carnival."

02:03.667 --> 02:05.417
Remove the "niv"
and switch the "l" and the "a,"

02:05.500 --> 02:06.959
and you got "Carla."

02:16.542 --> 02:18.333
Oh, my God, he's right.

02:20.166 --> 02:22.583
Thank you so much
for letting me stay here, Elliot.

02:22.667 --> 02:26.166
Please. And I still have
only one rule.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.417
I cannot talk or be talked to
while I'm on the toilet,

02:28.500 --> 02:30.250
and I also cannot talk
or be talked to

02:30.375 --> 02:31.834
by someone who's on the toilet.

02:31.917 --> 02:34.041
You told me yesterday, Elliot.
I get it.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.500
Mmm, you say you get it,

02:35.583 --> 02:37.041
and yet you still managed
to knock this morning

02:37.125 --> 02:38.458
and ask if I wanted coffee.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.875
-Oh, I just thought--
-Ba, ba, ba, ba, bah!

02:40.959 --> 02:42.625
Mmm. We're gonna pretend
that never happened

02:42.709 --> 02:44.500
or I won't poo again for two months.

02:44.583 --> 02:48.959
Oh, God, this sucks!
I hate March.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.583
Do you realize two years ago
this Sunday my Mom died?

02:51.667 --> 02:54.333
Plus, last March, you got that
hideous haircut. Remember?

02:55.333 --> 02:57.625
Look, Carla,
if it makes you feel any better,

02:57.709 --> 02:59.625
I'm sure Turk's just as miserable.

02:59.709 --> 03:01.458
Whoo!
Whoo!

03:01.542 --> 03:03.625
Wait! Ok, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

03:03.709 --> 03:08.500
-My tummy's starting to rumble.
-Faster!

03:08.583 --> 03:13.333
-Jump! Go for it! Kids, don't fly out!
-I'm gonna hurl!

03:13.417 --> 03:18.250
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own</i>
<i>no, I know ♪</i>

03:18.333 --> 03:20.333
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:23.625 --> 03:25.250
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:26.959 --> 03:29.000
(J.D.) <i>You see a lot</i>
<i>of sad things in a hospital.</i>

03:29.083 --> 03:31.542
<i>But nothing's quite</i>
<i>as sad as a dermatologist</i>

03:31.625 --> 03:34.250
<i>that's just been paged,</i>
<i>milking it for all it's worth.</i>

03:34.333 --> 03:36.208
All right, everybody,
watch your backs!

03:36.291 --> 03:38.125
Skin doctor coming through!

03:38.208 --> 03:41.125
I got to get somewhere stat!

03:41.709 --> 03:43.250
You called for a consult?

03:43.333 --> 03:46.083
Mr. Warner, do you see
what you've made me do?

03:46.166 --> 03:48.917
By once again choosing to spend
all of your free time

03:49.000 --> 03:51.959
out on the surface of the sun
until melanomas develop,

03:52.041 --> 03:54.709
you have forced me to pull the
attending dermatologist

03:54.792 --> 03:58.417
away from his bacne seminar
and validate his most ridiculous

03:58.500 --> 03:59.875
of career choices.

03:59.959 --> 04:01.875
-Ehh!
-Oh, God.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.834
I just want to look good.

04:03.917 --> 04:06.250
You, my friend,
look so damn leathery,

04:06.333 --> 04:09.333
I'm honestly tempted
to wrap you around a baseball,

04:09.417 --> 04:10.542
cinch you up with a belt,

04:10.625 --> 04:12.917
and stick you under my mattress
so that you're good and broken in

04:13.000 --> 04:14.125
for the big game on Sunday.

04:14.208 --> 04:17.125
But since I'm here to heal,
not judge,

04:17.208 --> 04:20.333
I'm gonna go ahead and
write you a couple of prescriptions.

04:20.417 --> 04:24.166
You'll find that this first one
is for an extra large mallet

04:24.250 --> 04:26.417
to help you pound
some sense into yourself.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.375
The second one
is for a big, floppy hat

04:29.458 --> 04:33.500
that you're now to wear every single
time you leave the house.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.041
Have a great day.
You look like a purse.

04:36.125 --> 04:37.625
Perry, a word.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.667
Oh. Oh, yeah.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.000
Your skin's all messed up.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.667
Perry, I am sick and tired
of listening to people complain

04:47.750 --> 04:51.291
about being called fatties, dummies,
boozers, losers, winos, tubbos,

04:51.375 --> 04:53.458
tokers, smokers,
and jamokers,

04:53.542 --> 04:55.250
whatever the hell jamokers means.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.166
I was actually saying "jokers" and
I had coffee cake in my mouth.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.208
Bottom line,
unlike my masseuse Frida,

05:00.291 --> 05:01.834
you're not pretty enough
to be this rough.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.291
Work on your bedside manner.

05:03.375 --> 05:06.041
Say, Bobbo,
when exactly was the last time

05:06.125 --> 05:07.625
you treated a patient?

05:08.750 --> 05:11.834
Now you listen to me, Betty.
No matter how long it takes,

05:11.917 --> 05:13.041
we're gonna get through this.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.500
Congratulations, Bob.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.458
They just named you
chief of medicine.

05:16.542 --> 05:19.875
Bingo! Smell you later, Betty.

05:20.875 --> 05:24.000
Fine. You want me to take a patient,
I'll take a patient.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.083
The Bobatron is actually
gonna try to connect

05:26.166 --> 05:30.166
with another human being?
It is so on.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.625
-(whistles) Guys, it's so on.
-Awesome.

05:32.709 --> 05:33.792
-What's on?
-Who cares?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.625
-He referred to me as a guy.
-Dude, we stayed up too late.

05:36.709 --> 05:39.834
It was our first annual interracial
buddy movie night. We had to.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.208
You know,
I'm still pissed that you thought

05:41.291 --> 05:43.166
<i>Turner &amp; Hooch</i>
was an interracial buddy movie.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.583
I didn't know
it was Tom Hanks and a dog, ok?

05:45.667 --> 05:48.333
Don't paint me as a racist
just because I thought "black guy"

05:48.417 --> 05:49.875
when I heard the name Hooch.

05:49.959 --> 05:52.792
-Yeah, J.D., what's up?
-Oh, sorry, Hooch.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.834
We were just talking
about the "movie".

05:54.917 --> 05:57.333
Ha, ha! No biggie.
Happens all the time.

05:57.417 --> 05:58.542
(clicks tongue)

05:59.917 --> 06:05.458
Ok, so it was an honest mistake.
Gotta go. Hey.

06:05.542 --> 06:07.542
(slap) Too hard!
What is going on with Turk?

06:07.625 --> 06:08.709
He doesn't even
seem bummed out.

06:08.792 --> 06:11.583
-I uplifted his spirits.
-How did you do that?

06:11.667 --> 06:13.458
Because Carla
is just bottoming out, man.

06:13.542 --> 06:15.291
I mean, I'm not even supposed
to be here at work today.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.250
I just came to use the bathroom
because she keeps violating the rule.

06:18.333 --> 06:19.583
Quiet on the crapper?

06:19.667 --> 06:21.834
Yeah. It's like she just
stores everything up

06:21.917 --> 06:23.500
until my cheeks hit the seat.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.083
She thinks she's exempt
from the rule.

06:26.166 --> 06:29.166
Nobody is exempt
from the rule, J.D.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.000
Ok. Shh. It's ok.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.083
I'll never talk to you
on the crapper. Ok.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.792
I can't afford to soundproof
my bathroom.

06:35.875 --> 06:39.291
Listen, the way I cheered up Turk,
I made it all about him.

06:39.375 --> 06:42.250
Find some way to lift
Carla's spirits up.

06:45.959 --> 06:49.000
-Surprise!
-What's going on?

06:49.083 --> 06:50.959
We are going to celebrate
your Mom's death.

06:51.041 --> 06:53.875
I mean, your Mom's life. We're gonna
celebrate your dead Mom's life.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.834
I even got a cake.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.583
Wow! Does it say "dead"
anywhere on it?

07:00.667 --> 07:03.792
Mmm. Not anymore.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.250
Junior, I don't know
what you doing in my area,

07:09.333 --> 07:11.041
but you better be looking
for some bandages

07:11.125 --> 07:13.000
'cause you're gonna need them
when I get through with you.

07:13.583 --> 07:17.083
Dr. Kelso.
I didn't recognize you in scrubs.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.333
Well, that's ok, Laverne.

07:18.417 --> 07:21.750
I didn't recognize you without
your mini TV and your feet up.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.083
(catcall whistle)

07:25.166 --> 07:27.166
Real nice outfit there, Bobbo.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.333
Perry, you just go right ahead
and say what you want,

07:29.417 --> 07:31.917
because Dr. Bob Kelso
is back in action

07:32.000 --> 07:33.625
and he hasn't missed a step.

07:33.709 --> 07:35.625
Now, where do we
keep the sick people?

07:36.125 --> 07:38.875
Hello, Ms. Goldman.
I'm your doctor.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.125
Don't you mean my doctor's
great-great-great- great-grandfather?

07:43.375 --> 07:45.709
-You're old.
-Yeah, I got that.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.291
Hey, friend. I switched shifts
so we could hang out tonight.

07:51.375 --> 07:54.041
Hell, yeah.
There's no beer in the fridge.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.458
You know what, we're gonna have to
make a stop and pick up some hooch!

07:56.542 --> 07:57.750
Yeah, Turk?

07:57.834 --> 08:00.625
Sorry, man.
I was talking about the beer.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.291
Oh. There's no problem, buddy.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.834
All right! Ha, ha!

08:03.917 --> 08:06.875
Just seems like you
could've said "beer."

08:06.959 --> 08:09.166
It's a much more
common word.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.375
My bad.
Uh, won't happen again.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.583
Won't happen again.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.959
-You knew he was there, didn't you?
-Couldn't help myself.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.834
(J.D.) <i>It's weird. I mean,</i>
<i>I want his marriage to work out,</i>

08:22.917 --> 08:25.166
<i>but it's nice to have</i>
<i>Turk all to myself again.</i>

08:26.333 --> 08:28.792
(Janitor) <i>It's weird. I mean,</i>
<i>I want to follow him down the hall</i>

08:28.875 --> 08:31.750
<i>and crack him over the head,</i>
<i>but I'm so drunk right now,</i>

08:31.834 --> 08:34.875
<i>I know I'll collapse</i>
<i>if I even move an inch.</i>

08:35.375 --> 08:37.500
And I am not kidding you.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.750
My Mom turns to the
guidance counselor,

08:39.834 --> 08:43.041
and she says...
(speaks Spanish)

08:43.125 --> 08:46.709
Ha, ha, ha!
(snorts)

08:46.792 --> 08:47.792
You understood that?

08:47.875 --> 08:50.417
No, but I know when I'm supposed
to laugh in any language.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.917
Ok. You know, I was skeptical,
but it's been kind of nice

08:54.000 --> 08:55.166
reminiscing about my Mom.

08:55.250 --> 08:58.333
It's about to get
a whole lot nicer.

08:58.417 --> 08:59.291
(beep)

08:59.375 --> 09:01.583
(answering machine)
<i>Hi, sweety, it's Mom.</i>

09:01.667 --> 09:03.834
<i>I just called to tell you</i>
<i>how much I love you.</i>

09:03.917 --> 09:05.000
Oh, my God.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.792
It's J.D.'s old
answering machine.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.417
-(beep)
-(answering machine) <i>Hi, Carla.</i>

09:08.500 --> 09:11.000
<i>I sure wish you would</i>
<i>call me once in a while.</i>

09:11.583 --> 09:14.125
Hadn't heard that one.

09:14.208 --> 09:16.291
So what other stories do you have
about your Mom?

09:16.375 --> 09:18.375
-(answering machine) <i>Carla</i>...
-God, it has batteries.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.542
(answering machine)
<i>It's me again.</i>

09:19.625 --> 09:22.834
<i>It seems like you never have time</i>
<i>for me anymore. Carla?</i>

09:22.917 --> 09:23.834
(beep)

09:23.917 --> 09:26.375
(answering machine) <i>Carla? Carla?</i>
<i>Pick up if you're there...</i>

09:26.458 --> 09:29.041
(recording muffled)

09:29.625 --> 09:32.542
What we are dealing with are
venostasis ulcers,

09:32.625 --> 09:34.458
most likely because of your weight.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.750
Wow. You figured out that I'm fat.

09:36.834 --> 09:38.333
You're either a brilliant doctor

09:38.417 --> 09:40.166
or every guy I've ever gone
to high school with.

09:40.250 --> 09:43.333
Ok, moving on.
From the numbers I'm seeing

09:43.417 --> 09:46.166
on your fasting glucose
and triglycerides, I'm suspecting--

09:46.250 --> 09:47.625
Metabolic syndrome?

09:47.709 --> 09:51.000
Yes. Now this condition
is not that rare.

09:51.083 --> 09:54.166
-One in five people have it.
-Stop doing that!

09:54.250 --> 09:56.125
Why am I paying you
to tell me things

09:56.208 --> 09:57.834
I've already figured out on my own?

09:57.917 --> 10:03.166
Maybe because I graduated first
in my class at Stanford in 1972.

10:03.667 --> 10:07.083
You graduated twelfth
in your class in 1968.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.000
She googled your ass.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.500
Laverne, I am not interested
in your street lingo.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.291
What I am interested in is where
she found that magic phone

10:14.375 --> 10:16.250
that keeps making me
look like an idiot.

10:18.834 --> 10:20.625
(J.D.)<i> Last summer Turk and I</i>
<i>were forced to choose</i>

10:20.709 --> 10:22.959
<i>between helping to stem</i>
<i>a Hepatitis C outbreak</i>

10:23.041 --> 10:25.250
<i>in the inner city</i>
<i>or going to bartending school.</i>

10:25.333 --> 10:27.333
<i>I've always felt</i>
<i>we did the right thing.</i>

10:27.417 --> 10:29.166
<i>Especially since I knew</i>
<i>Turk needed</i>

10:29.250 --> 10:33.041
<i>to blow off some steam before his</i>
<i>big meeting with Carla tomorrow.</i>

10:33.125 --> 10:34.875
All right, everybody!
We're your guest bartenders!

10:34.959 --> 10:36.625
-We'll be here all night!
-Oh, you know what?

10:36.709 --> 10:38.667
Actually, I'm gonna go home
and put some thought

10:38.750 --> 10:40.458
into what I'm gonna say
to Carla tomorrow morning.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.625
(J.D.) <i>I knew I was being selfish,</i>
<i>but I couldn't help it.</i>

10:42.709 --> 10:44.166
<i>It was our last hurrah.</i>

10:44.750 --> 10:47.834
Turk, you know Carla likes it
when you speak from your heart.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.041
Improv that, dog!

10:51.458 --> 10:53.250
Stay here and drink...
For Carla.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.625
Well, since we're doing it for Carla...

10:54.709 --> 10:56.709
-For Carla!
-Let's do this!

10:56.792 --> 10:57.917
(cheering)

10:58.000 --> 10:59.208
(J.D.) <i>My barber once told me</i>

10:59.291 --> 11:01.250
<i>it's important to finish</i>
<i>what you've started.</i>

11:03.291 --> 11:05.333
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>sometimes what you've started</i>

11:05.417 --> 11:07.834
<i>was clearly the worst idea</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

11:07.917 --> 11:09.709
Wasn't this kind of fun?

11:11.834 --> 11:13.333
It stopped.

11:13.417 --> 11:15.750
(J.D.)<i> Other times, it's a lot</i>
<i>harder than you thought.</i>

11:15.834 --> 11:17.166
(pounding)

11:17.250 --> 11:21.333
Damn it, young lady, let me in!
This is my hospital!

11:21.834 --> 11:25.333
Hey, Bob,
what's shaking in patientVille?

11:25.417 --> 11:29.542
Oh, just trying to keep myself from
spending all day in there with her.

11:29.625 --> 11:33.709
-Such a doll.
-Oh, you Bob.

11:34.709 --> 11:37.250
(J.D.)<i> Still, even if you end up with</i>
<i>a hangover that would slay a walrus,</i>

11:37.333 --> 11:39.792
<i>it's all worth it, especially when</i>
<i>you know that at this very moment,</i>

11:39.875 --> 11:42.000
<i>your best friend is at brunch,</i>
<i>saving his marriage.</i>

11:43.917 --> 11:45.291
What time is it?

11:45.875 --> 11:47.500
(J.D.)
<i>Or he missed it.</i>

11:52.375 --> 11:54.875
(J.D.) <i>This was my fault,</i>
<i>so I was determined to fix it.</i>

11:54.959 --> 11:58.125
<i>Still, I needed Elliot's help,</i>
<i>so I decided to break the ice first.</i>

11:58.208 --> 12:00.208
Hey, Elliot, do me a favor.

12:00.291 --> 12:01.959
What do you mean, say "hooch"?

12:02.041 --> 12:04.667
Oh, my God, what?
I'm a little busy.

12:04.750 --> 12:07.834
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm not really sure
what's happening right now.

12:07.917 --> 12:09.125
Well, of course you're not.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.750
Because in your head,
it's all about you, isn't it?

12:11.834 --> 12:14.291
Well, no more.
Say "hooch" again,

12:14.417 --> 12:16.792
it will be the last thing
you ever say.

12:17.709 --> 12:21.500
Ha, ha!
He was mad, wasn't he?

12:21.583 --> 12:23.250
Oh, Hooch is crazy.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.542
Listen, tell Carla it's my fault

12:25.625 --> 12:27.834
because I kept Turk out all night
and he overslept.

12:27.917 --> 12:29.083
It was J.D.'s fault.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.542
How come Turk
hasn't called me?

12:30.625 --> 12:32.917
-Why hasn't Turk called her?
-I wanted to fix it.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.375
He wanted to fix it.

12:35.041 --> 12:37.125
Ask Betty why he's such a girly girl.

12:37.208 --> 12:39.083
-Not now.
-Do it now, do it now.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.917
-Call her Betty.
-You're insane.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.291
Betty, Betty, Betty,
Betty, Betty, Betty. (whistles)

12:43.375 --> 12:44.709
-Betty?
-Yeah?

12:44.792 --> 12:46.208
-Oh, my God, it worked!

12:46.291 --> 12:47.041
-Ha!

12:47.125 --> 12:48.750
Ask J.D. when Turk
wants to get together.

12:48.834 --> 12:49.834
When does Turk
want to get together?

12:49.917 --> 12:52.291
He, oh, look,
I'm so sorry about last night.

12:52.375 --> 12:54.208
But I already explained to Carla
how you overslept.

12:54.291 --> 12:55.792
Now she wants to know
when you want to meet up.

12:55.875 --> 12:59.542
I didn't oversleep.
I decided not to go.

13:01.959 --> 13:05.834
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

13:05.917 --> 13:09.792
I don't know how she jammed this.
Can you open that door?

13:09.875 --> 13:12.875
(Janitor) <i>Ok, you made it up here</i>
<i>without passing out or vomiting.</i>

13:13.000 --> 13:14.875
<i>Now just calmly</i>
<i>and eloquently explain</i>

13:14.959 --> 13:16.250
<i>that you can't open</i>
<i>the door right now,</i>

13:16.333 --> 13:17.834
<i>and he'll be on his way.</i>

13:17.917 --> 13:20.166
(speaks gibberish) <i>Well done.</i>

13:20.250 --> 13:22.208
Are you mocking me?

13:23.750 --> 13:25.959
Just give me this
damn screwdriver.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.500
Hello, young lady.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.458
I went ahead and set up
an appointment for you

13:35.542 --> 13:36.417
with our nutritionist.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.792
She's going to help you create
a diet and exercise plan

13:38.875 --> 13:41.041
so I never have
to see you in here again.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.500
Yeah, I'm having a gastric bypass.

13:43.583 --> 13:46.667
But, Ms. Goldman,
you're only twenty-five,

13:46.750 --> 13:51.125
and considering that any serious
surgery has inherent risks,

13:51.208 --> 13:53.667
-I really don't--
-How are you not getting this?

13:53.750 --> 13:56.125
I don't care what you think.

13:58.875 --> 14:02.166
Carla, I am so sorry about those
messages from your mother,

14:02.250 --> 14:03.583
but I'm going to make it up to you.

14:03.667 --> 14:04.834
It's ok, Elliot.

14:04.917 --> 14:07.333
It was really nice hearing
my Mom's voice again.

14:07.417 --> 14:10.291
I just,
I wish I could talk to her

14:10.375 --> 14:12.000
about everything that's going on.

14:15.500 --> 14:19.917
Oh. You know, I'm really not
comfortable with this kind of stuff.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.834
Carla, you can totally talk
to people once they're gone.

14:22.917 --> 14:25.375
I used to talk to our maid Consuela
all the time.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.625
-When did she die?
-When I was eleven.

14:28.709 --> 14:30.125
At least that's what
my dad told me.

14:30.208 --> 14:32.125
I mean, I found out after college
that he actually had her deported

14:32.208 --> 14:33.625
for putting knives
in the fork drawer.

14:33.709 --> 14:37.250
You know, Elliot, you're a lot
more normal than you should be.

14:37.333 --> 14:40.291
Well, you do what
you can with what you got.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.208
(thud)

14:42.792 --> 14:44.583
Holy frick!

14:46.166 --> 14:48.875
First my parents get divorced,
now you and Carla are all messed up.

14:48.959 --> 14:51.000
What's the common denominator?
J.D.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.959
I should get business cards
that say "love destroyer."

14:53.041 --> 14:54.125
Dude, it's not your fault.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.625
Don't get me wrong,
hanging with you

14:55.709 --> 14:57.500
these last couple of days
has been nice.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.000
Nice? It was intoxicating.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.458
You were hanging with the J. Dizzle.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.458
I'm sure it felt like some sort
of crazy dream.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.583
I know, 'cause with the J. Dizzle,
everything's hassle-free.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.250
Yeah, like some sort of crazy,
hassle-free dream.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.792
Ok, stop, stop.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.250
Maybe that's
why I skipped the brunch.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.625
I just can't help thinking
marriage shouldn't be this hard.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.208
So you're my gastric bypass.
You got any questions?

15:16.291 --> 15:18.333
Nope.
See you in the O.R. tomorrow.

15:18.417 --> 15:22.667
I'll be the one with the mask on.
That's how easy marriage should be.

15:23.875 --> 15:27.709
I won't be there, but I'm sure
it will be nice operating on you.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.583
What is it, Bob?

15:37.667 --> 15:41.709
When the hell did patients
stop respecting us?

15:42.291 --> 15:44.125
I really tried to help
that young woman,

15:44.208 --> 15:47.291
and she rolled over me like
Enid's wheelchair over Baxter's tail.

15:47.375 --> 15:49.750
-Huh?
-Enid was recently paralyzed.

15:49.834 --> 15:52.750
-I haven't told anyone.
-Hmm.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.709
Anyway, I couldn't
handle the patients,

15:55.792 --> 15:57.834
so go ahead, take your shots.

15:58.417 --> 16:01.792
I want to, Bob, I really do.

16:01.875 --> 16:05.792
But my first patient today
was a snot-nosed little punk

16:05.875 --> 16:07.834
who wouldn't let me give him
a rectal exam

16:07.917 --> 16:10.291
unless I said "pretty please" first,

16:10.375 --> 16:13.417
and I'm just not big
on begging strangers

16:13.500 --> 16:16.208
to stick my hand up their butt.

16:16.291 --> 16:18.959
Not even in my private time.

16:19.041 --> 16:22.542
Remember when being a doctor meant
that people would look up to you?

16:22.625 --> 16:24.625
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:25.125 --> 16:28.667
When I first started out,
I could take this old white coat out,

16:28.750 --> 16:32.375
get a free haircut or
a nice table at a restaurant.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.500
Hell, I never once
got a speeding ticket.

16:34.583 --> 16:38.417
People used to give me cards
and gifts and sometimes even a pie

16:38.500 --> 16:40.375
just for doing my job.

16:40.458 --> 16:44.041
Every mother wanted me
to marry their daughter

16:44.125 --> 16:46.333
because I was a doctor,

16:46.417 --> 16:49.291
and I used that to sleep
with all those mothers

16:49.375 --> 16:51.208
because that's what
a house call used to mean.

16:51.792 --> 16:55.041
Those were the good ole'
incredibly disturbing days, Bob.

16:57.166 --> 17:01.000
Today, people think of us
as drug-dispensing walking lawsuits

17:01.083 --> 17:04.166
who are in fact less informed
than their Internet phones.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.458
So that's what
that damn thing was.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.250
I will tell you one thing, though.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.834
If you even want to have
an outside chance

17:11.917 --> 17:14.041
of reaching someone nowadays,

17:14.125 --> 17:16.667
you damn sure better
speak from your heart.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.208
Thank you, Perry.

17:20.959 --> 17:22.583
Blow it out your ass, Bob.

17:24.625 --> 17:27.333
Ok. Ohh!
(spits, coughs)

17:27.375 --> 17:29.125
-(Carla) Elliot.
-Yeah?

17:29.208 --> 17:30.583
I spoke to the groundskeeper.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.792
He'll come over as soon as
he finishes burying Paul Newman.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.750
Different Paul Newman I asked.
I'll just wait here with you.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.583
Oh, Carla, go.

17:39.667 --> 17:43.208
I'm fine down here in this giant,
fresh, empty grave.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.291
Ok, bye.

17:49.458 --> 17:52.333
(J.D.) <i>I didn't know what to say</i>
<i>to Turk next, and then it happened.</i>

17:57.834 --> 17:59.208
Sir, the door was open.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.792
-I know. I just love doing that.
-Ah, what now, grandpa?

18:02.875 --> 18:05.709
You are gonna shut your damn yapper
and listen for a change

18:05.792 --> 18:08.208
because I got you pegged, sweetheart.

18:08.291 --> 18:11.917
You want to take the easy way out
with this surgery

18:12.000 --> 18:14.959
because you're scared, and you're
scared because if you try and fail,

18:15.041 --> 18:16.667
there's only you to blame.

18:16.750 --> 18:20.834
Well, missy, let me break
this down for you Bobbo-style.

18:20.917 --> 18:24.375
Life is scary.
Get used to it.

18:24.959 --> 18:28.166
(J.D.) <i>And then it seemed like</i>
<i>Dr. Kelso wasn't only talking to her.</i>

18:28.667 --> 18:31.458
There are no magical fixes.

18:31.542 --> 18:32.875
It's all up to you.

18:34.333 --> 18:38.834
So get up off your keister, get out
of here, and go start doing the work.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.792
-What if it's too hard?
-Yeah, what if it's too hard?

18:41.875 --> 18:44.333
Turkelton, I have no idea
why you're chiming in,

18:44.417 --> 18:46.417
but I'll say this to both of you.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.500
Nothing in this world
that's worth having comes easy.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.583
I gotta go.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.208
Ok, here it goes.

19:00.583 --> 19:02.500
Oh, this is so weird.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.875
I don't really know what to say.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.875
Sorry I haven't visited much.
I've been kind of busy.

19:09.959 --> 19:13.208
That's not true. Why am I lying
to a slab of granite?

19:17.125 --> 19:20.333
I just know I really could've
used you around this week.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.083
I miss you.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.709
Can you tell her I miss her, too?

19:31.250 --> 19:34.417
You know what? Never mind.
Because she wouldn't believe you.

19:34.500 --> 19:38.625
-Ha, ha, ha!
-Ha, ha, ha!

19:38.709 --> 19:41.375
(J.D.) <i>You can never</i>
<i>truly capture the past.</i>

19:44.917 --> 19:46.750
That'll be $18.

19:47.250 --> 19:50.583
Oh, I'm not paying.
I'm a doctor.

19:50.667 --> 19:54.542
Yeah, we don't do that anymore.
You're paying.

20:00.959 --> 20:02.208

<i>You still have to try, though,</i>

20:02.291 --> 20:04.709
<i>because as a recently</i>
<i>incarcerated doctor once said,</i>

20:04.792 --> 20:07.083
<i>"Nothing worth having comes easy."</i>

20:12.333 --> 20:14.375
So you ready to come home?

20:16.917 --> 20:19.709
I'm trying to get there, Turk.
I'm just not there yet.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.667
All right.
You take all the time you need, ok?

20:24.750 --> 20:26.166
Wait.

20:28.667 --> 20:32.166
Do you mind sitting here
with me for a little longer?

20:44.041 --> 20:49.000
Is anybody there?
Anybody? Hello?

20:50.542 --> 20:53.667
Keep it together, Elliot.
Things could be worse.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.583
(thunder)

20:55.667 --> 21:00.041
Oh, dear God.
I'm going to die in a watery grave.
