WEBVTT

01:07.193 --> 01:09.820
'Cause he's an asshole!
Tell him no.

01:10.780 --> 01:12.281
Tell him no, too.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.117
Him, tell, "Fuck you."

01:15.493 --> 01:16.786
No, I'll be here a minute.

01:16.869 --> 01:20.164
Got some guy coming up who thinks he's
gonna muscle me out of my property.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.917
What's it matter?
Just another tough guy, that's all.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.168
They're driving up.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.087
Get their pieces.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.422
All right, guys,
let's go.

01:31.342 --> 01:34.512
We got a surprise
for these gentlemen.

01:54.198 --> 01:58.369
<i>Robert Durant, you and your
girls are going to stand for a search.</i>

02:07.920 --> 02:09.880
- All right, move it.
- There you go.

02:11.841 --> 02:13.968
Oh, a bunch of
cuties, huh?

02:14.510 --> 02:16.762
Just hold it there,
cueball.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.810
Bum leg?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.775
No leg.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.569
I was engaged to a girl
once with a wooden leg.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.154
Yeah?
What happened?

03:15.237 --> 03:16.864
Had to break it off.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.452
All right, cut the crap!

03:22.453 --> 03:24.330
I got three things
to say to you, Durant.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.041
One, I ain't selling
my property.

03:27.416 --> 03:32.963
Two, nobody muscles Eddie Black,
especially a bunch of dinks.

03:34.006 --> 03:38.886
And three, if y'alls don't like that,
which I can already see you don't,

03:39.595 --> 03:41.597
we can cut your balls off.

03:42.098 --> 03:45.101
Maybe that would be
more satisfactorys to you.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.108
Die!

04:01.867 --> 04:03.744
Take them down!

04:15.548 --> 04:19.093
Take him down! Take that
one with the goddamn gun!

05:00.843 --> 05:01.844
Now,

05:02.386 --> 05:04.638
let's consider my points

05:06.432 --> 05:07.933
one by one.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.061
One,

05:12.980 --> 05:16.734
I try not to let my anger
get the better of me.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.738
Two,

05:21.030 --> 05:23.115
I don't always succeed.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.578
Three.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.623
I've got seven more points.

07:08.887 --> 07:12.516
<i>System ready to receive input.</i>

08:16.622 --> 08:19.667
Just hold together,
you little...

08:20.751 --> 08:22.002
Shit.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.129
Fragmentation. Time?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.007
Ninety-nine minutes.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.425
Again.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.011
Why?

08:31.637 --> 08:33.889
Why, why, why?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.726
<i>Synthetic
skin data analysis...</i>

08:40.688 --> 08:42.648
What is destabilizing it?

08:43.232 --> 08:45.442
Why won't
the liquid skin last?

08:50.114 --> 08:52.491
The vivification process
was easy.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.326
Tissue rejection?

08:55.452 --> 08:58.664
We licked that.
I know we're close.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.041
We're smart guys,
so what is it?

09:02.459 --> 09:05.003
Why can't we
make these cells stable?

09:11.343 --> 09:12.636
What now?

09:15.973 --> 09:17.015
Now?

09:17.433 --> 09:18.642
Well...

09:18.976 --> 09:20.853
We think it out again.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.564
Patiently. Objectively.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.734
I don't care
how long it takes, Yakitito,

09:26.984 --> 09:29.403
I know it's out there
waiting for us.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.155
Ah, I can feel it.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.615
God, I can almost taste it.

09:40.706 --> 09:43.250
Here she is,
the girl of your dreams.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.918
Oh! Oh, Peyton!

09:45.002 --> 09:46.587
Ah, you were sweet.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.547
How's the skin coming?

09:51.008 --> 09:52.968
Still won't last
past 99.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.098
It'll happen. It will
happen, you know.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.808
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.686
Look at you.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.521
Rebel without a clue.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.523
Those were the days.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.442
Hey...

10:08.817 --> 10:09.902
What?

10:10.736 --> 10:12.070
Come here.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.031
What?
Come here.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.699
Oh, I know
what's on your mind.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.826
Let me
show you something.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.290
God, you always wear things
that are so difficult to...

10:23.373 --> 10:24.416
Ta-da!

10:24.500 --> 10:25.793
Oh, yeah!

10:27.336 --> 10:29.171
Come on, let's dance.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.778
Herb Gorson, please.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.657
Here you go, babe.
Peyton!

10:56.740 --> 10:58.158
Oops. Sorry.

10:58.700 --> 10:59.701
<i>Hello?</i>

10:59.785 --> 11:01.495
Herb, hi.
It's Julie Hastings.

11:01.578 --> 11:05.666
Listen, I found some memos when I was
researching the Von Hoffenstein deal

11:05.749 --> 11:07.209
that I don't think
I was supposed to find.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.293
<i>Yeah?
What are they?</i>

11:08.377 --> 11:13.257
They're from Strack to a guy
named Claude Bellasarious.

11:13.340 --> 11:17.261
And they're records of payments to
various people on the Zoning Commission.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.138
Well, I think
they're payoffs.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.807
<i>If it's an accusation,
you better be sure.</i>

11:21.890 --> 11:24.059
Yeah, well, what I want to
do is talk to Strack first,

11:24.142 --> 11:26.603
give him the benefit
of the doubt.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.565
Yeah, okay.
<i>Call me.</i>

11:29.648 --> 11:31.275
All right, I'll talk
to you later, Herb. Bye.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.734
Bye, Herb.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.154
Oh, I don't want to go.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.239
Don't go.
Don't go.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.824
I have to go.
Stay. Stay.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.159
I have to go now! I have to go now.
I'm late.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.286
Julie!

11:42.369 --> 11:44.538
I'll call you... later.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.712
Julie!
Julie, wait.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.046
What is it?

11:53.797 --> 11:55.549
I've been thinking.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.303
We should get married.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.180
Marriage?

12:02.264 --> 12:03.765
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.893
I've just started getting
things going at the firm,

12:05.976 --> 12:07.978
and I really like
having my own place.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.564
But we're practically
living together now.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.902
All marriage means is you answer
the phone in the morning,

12:14.985 --> 12:17.738
and if it's my grandmother, you don't
pretend it's the wrong number.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.907
The poor woman's beginning to
think she has Alzheimer's.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.242
I can't talk
about it now.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.660
Come here.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.663
Jules, I'm asking you
to marry me.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.415
Peyt, I love you...

12:28.498 --> 12:29.791
I mean,
I realized...

12:29.875 --> 12:32.127
...but I got to
think it over, okay?

12:45.682 --> 12:48.935
Mr. Strack, I've been
going over some documents.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.105
And I've come across
something that puzzles me.

12:52.314 --> 12:56.151
It's a memo from your office
to a Mr. Claude Bellasarious.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.321
It details
certain payments that...

12:59.404 --> 13:01.406
Yes, yes.
I know the memo.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.283
Well, it seems
like the payments were...

13:03.367 --> 13:06.286
Were payoffs
to the Zoning Commission,

13:06.370 --> 13:08.997
bribes,
to call a spade a spade.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.916
Does that shock you?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.793
No. I guessed as much.

13:13.043 --> 13:17.089
You weren't supposed to know about it.
That file was not supposed to circulate.

13:17.172 --> 13:20.217
However, I am asking you
to understand.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.222
Take a look
at that model, Julie.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.973
That's the dream.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.976
Acres of riverfront
reclaimed from decay.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.938
Thousands of jobs created.

13:33.063 --> 13:38.068
A building block, a very large
building block laid for the future.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.738
Not such a bad dream,
as dreams go.

13:43.073 --> 13:47.911
And if the price of realizing that dream
is the occasional distasteful chore,

13:49.579 --> 13:52.749
well, I don't run away.
I say, "So be it."

13:54.251 --> 13:55.377
So...

13:56.920 --> 13:58.505
Want to book me?

13:59.798 --> 14:03.844
The fact remains that I'm in possession
of evidence of the commission of a crime.

14:03.927 --> 14:08.140
Well, let me suggest this. You
excuse yourself for a few minutes,

14:08.223 --> 14:11.059
go to the ladies' room
leaving your briefcase here.

14:11.143 --> 14:14.271
What happens to that memorandum
while it's in my custody

14:14.354 --> 14:16.481
is my responsibility.

14:17.858 --> 14:22.446
I wish it were that simple, but first
of all, I don't have the memo with me.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.824
I'm trying to protect you.

14:28.285 --> 14:31.788
Does the name Robert Durant
mean anything to you?

14:33.290 --> 14:34.875
Drugs, racketeering...

14:34.958 --> 14:36.543
And real estate.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.255
Robert Durant is a competitor
for the riverfront.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.091
He's a very dangerous
man, Julie.

14:43.175 --> 14:47.512
And I fully believe he'd do anything
to get his hands on that document.

14:52.309 --> 14:55.896
DNA content, acceptable.
Glucose, right on.

14:55.979 --> 14:59.858
We've even checked the collagen congeners.
They're fine.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.069
This is unbelievable. Every day,
it's a different combination...

15:02.152 --> 15:03.695
Time, Yakitito.

15:04.613 --> 15:05.655
Time?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.574
Ninety-eight minutes.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.622
Oh, the circuit again.
I'll fix it.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.665
I knew we were pulling
too much juice on that line.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.292
Yakitito, time?

15:18.835 --> 15:20.128
Huh?
Time?

15:20.879 --> 15:22.839
Ninety-nine.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.674
One hundred minutes!

15:25.133 --> 15:26.551
What? What?

15:26.676 --> 15:29.554
The cells, they're holding.
They're stable!

15:29.638 --> 15:31.681
But, Dr. Westlake,
why now?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.393
The dark.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.270
Oh, of course.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.105
The dark.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.109
I think the synthetic cells
are photosensitive.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.069
This is unbelievable!

15:44.444 --> 15:46.530
What is it about
the dark?

15:48.865 --> 15:50.867
What secret does it hold?

15:53.036 --> 15:54.788
They're still stable.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.289
Time, Yakitito, time?

15:56.373 --> 15:57.874
101 minutes.

15:58.667 --> 16:02.003
Finally. We can replace
damaged skin tissue!

16:02.379 --> 16:05.423
No, Yakitito, no. Not quite, my friend.
Not yet.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.593
All we've got is a piece of the puzzle.
There's still the big question.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.805
How to keep the cells stable
past 99 minutes in the light?

16:11.888 --> 16:14.141
But at least now we know
it's all about light!

16:15.475 --> 16:16.893
I'll get it.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.891
No foolish heroics,
if you please.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.228
We've come
only for documents.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.397
Tell us where to find
the Bellasarious memorandum,

17:02.480 --> 17:06.443
and we shall disappear, like a
nightmare before the breaking day.

17:07.736 --> 17:10.363
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.865
How unfortunate.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.325
What memorandum?

17:14.910 --> 17:16.036
No. Please.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.345
We want the memorandum.

17:34.638 --> 17:37.599
Should your houseboy's
predicament not jog your memory,

17:39.100 --> 17:41.478
you may bid him Godspeed.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.606
He's a lab assistant. For
God's sakes, let him breathe!

17:44.689 --> 17:47.275
You heard the doctor.
Ventilate him.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.736
No. No!

18:11.925 --> 18:13.677
- Bingo.
- Goody!

19:04.978 --> 19:07.022
Bring the Asian's fingers.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.860
Gentlemen.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.737
Rick, I'm proud of you.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.531
Clean through the brain,
that's how I like it.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.361
"Marry me?"

21:06.683 --> 21:08.810
Didn't see you doing
much work out there.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.646
That guy got blown to pieces.
All they found was an ear.

21:11.729 --> 21:15.024
Tiny little piece. Didn't
take me long to bury that.

21:34.544 --> 21:38.006
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

22:00.612 --> 22:01.738
I'm gonna
need some sponges.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.906
Okay.
You got them.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.408
Great. We'll get ready
to move him?

22:05.909 --> 22:07.202
Let's check
the eyes.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.245
Get a gurney in here.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.747
Right there.

22:11.456 --> 22:12.874
Straight in.

22:13.249 --> 22:17.337
<i>Next, we have a 30, 35-year-old
male, no ID, no medical history.</i>

22:17.420 --> 22:19.839
He was found on the riverbank
just south of the city.

22:19.923 --> 22:22.717
There's a sizeable population of
homeless and indigents there.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.220
We get at least three
no-names like him every week.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.638
Nobody does anything
about the homeless

22:26.721 --> 22:29.891
until they become train wrecks
like Mr. John Doe here.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.685
He's got burns covering
over 40% of his body.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.021
The hands and face
are the most severe.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.982
Ten years ago, pain from the burns
would have been intolerable.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.611
This man would have spent the
rest of his life screaming.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.948
Now we use
the Rangeberitz Technique.

22:45.490 --> 22:50.119
Quite simply, we sever the nerves
within the spino-thalamic tract, there,

22:50.203 --> 22:51.788
which, as you know,
transmits neural impulses

22:51.871 --> 22:54.624
of pain and vibratory sense
to the brain.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.711
No longer receiving
impulses of pain,

22:59.754 --> 23:01.798
you stick him with a pin...

23:04.342 --> 23:05.343
Ouch!

23:05.426 --> 23:07.428
And he can't even
feel it.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.559
As in many
radical procedures,

23:13.434 --> 23:16.604
there are serious side
effects to this operation.

23:17.605 --> 23:22.568
When the body ceases to feel, when
so much sensory input is lost,

23:22.652 --> 23:24.445
the mind grows hungry.

23:24.529 --> 23:30.994
Starved of its regular diet of input, it
takes the only remaining stimulation it has,

23:31.661 --> 23:34.664
the emotions,
and amplifies them,

23:34.747 --> 23:37.208
giving rise to
alienation and loneliness.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.294
Uncontrolled rage
is not uncommon.

23:39.377 --> 23:42.422
Now surges of adrenaline flow
unchecked through the body and brain,

23:42.505 --> 23:46.426
giving him augmented strength.
Hence, the restraints.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.471
Naturally, we give them
every chance of recovery.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.974
Remain optimistic,
inspire confidence,

23:53.224 --> 23:56.060
talk to him about
rehabilitation potential.

24:02.650 --> 24:05.903
Personally, I give him
a nine on the buzzard scale.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.055
<i>Code blue, burn unit.</i>

24:34.223 --> 24:35.558
Doctor?

24:37.185 --> 24:40.063
I'm in charge here.
Damn it, let me through!

25:47.296 --> 25:48.798
Julie.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.226
Julie!

26:00.977 --> 26:02.186
It's...

26:02.520 --> 26:04.439
...me!

27:10.463 --> 27:11.672
My lab.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.386
All my work.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.111
Oh, my God, no.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.654
No! No!

28:17.238 --> 28:19.323
No! No! No!

29:27.350 --> 29:29.018
Hello, my friend.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.324
Home.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.264

Yes.

Clever, clever.

31:54.872 --> 31:56.832
I must perfect the skin.

32:13.516 --> 32:14.517
Wrong!

32:14.600 --> 32:15.684
Wrong!

33:06.527 --> 33:07.778
My hands.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.074
They took...
They took my hands.

33:24.837 --> 33:28.632
They... They took...
They took my hands!

33:48.277 --> 33:50.070
Thank you for coming.

33:51.113 --> 33:54.200
Julie, with what you've been
going through lately,

33:54.283 --> 33:56.952
I... I haven't wanted
to bother you.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.164
But I have to know whether
you've come to a decision

34:00.247 --> 34:02.833
regarding
the Bellasarious memorandum.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.753
The decision's been made
for both of us.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.464
The papers were destroyed
in the fire.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.469
And I'd rather not talk about
it, if you don't mind.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.808
Julie, I'm sorry
I mentioned that.

34:20.935 --> 34:24.146
Believe me, I understand
how you feel. I really do.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.942
Unfortunately, there's
no cure for grief.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.985
But there is something
that eases the symptoms.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.821
It's called dancing.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.392
Would you like a martini?

35:01.684 --> 35:03.852
Yes. I would love one.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.368
<i>Ventilate him.</i>

35:52.943 --> 35:57.448
His name's Robert G. Durant! I
told you where they make the pickup!

35:59.033 --> 36:01.243
Oh, God! Don't!

36:01.493 --> 36:03.704
I've told you everything!

36:04.038 --> 36:07.332
I know, Rick.
I know you did.

36:09.543 --> 36:11.670
But let's pretend
you didn't!

36:32.483 --> 36:34.193
- Here you are, doll.
- How you doing, honey?

36:34.276 --> 36:36.111
Here's your favorite.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.488
I'm pretty good today.

36:46.622 --> 36:47.873
It wasn't that bad.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.875
Hey, Pauly.
Hey, Pauly.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.627
<i>Qué pasa?</i>

36:51.710 --> 36:52.878

36:52.961 --> 36:54.505

36:54.963 --> 36:56.757
Here's the cash, man.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.844
Got you a gift, huh?
You be good.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.806

Yo, Pauly.

40:59.833 --> 41:04.963
Hey, Durant wants to know where Rick
is, and he is hot. I mean really hot.

41:05.047 --> 41:08.550
I mean, don't ask me why.
I know he likes Ricky.

41:10.052 --> 41:12.846
Pauly, do you
know where the hell Rick is?

41:13.597 --> 41:14.973
Mmm-mmm.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.772
You okay, Pauly?

41:23.023 --> 41:24.107
Yeah.

41:24.775 --> 41:26.401
Here's the cash.

41:45.379 --> 41:48.673
Pauly, we've been
very concerned about you.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.843
Hey, Mr. Durant.
I must've overslept.

41:51.927 --> 41:54.846
I'm sorry. I guess
I missed the pickup, huh?

41:55.555 --> 41:57.182
Where's the money, Pauly?

41:57.265 --> 41:59.935
What money? I...
I didn't make the pickup.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.276
Rio.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.987
And first class.
How delightful.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.700
And another one for Rick.

42:15.409 --> 42:18.537
Well, that explains
his disappearance.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.205
Hey, I don't know
nothing about that!

42:20.288 --> 42:21.790
Where is the money, Pauly?

42:21.873 --> 42:25.544
What money? I swear to God,
Mr. Durant, I didn't make the pickup.

42:25.627 --> 42:28.505
I've been right here sleeping.
Jesus, I swear to God.

42:29.673 --> 42:32.217
I don't even know
how I got dressed!

42:36.388 --> 42:37.889
Well, Pauly...

42:42.060 --> 42:43.562
Have a nice flight.

43:13.842 --> 43:15.010
No.

43:43.830 --> 43:47.250
Oh, God. What have I become?
What have I become?

43:56.801 --> 43:58.011
Please.

44:04.893 --> 44:06.811
Hold. Please hold.

44:11.566 --> 44:13.401
Oh, just this once.

44:39.344 --> 44:40.762
What?

44:41.763 --> 44:43.098
What am I?

44:46.476 --> 44:48.019
What am I?

44:48.228 --> 44:51.106
Some kind of a circus freak?
Is that it?

44:52.774 --> 44:55.610
Is that it? Huh?
Some kind of freak?

44:55.694 --> 44:58.822
Maybe I should wearing a funny
little hat. Do you like it?

45:33.273 --> 45:35.692
I'll give you a goddamn show!

45:36.234 --> 45:37.444
Yeah!

45:37.736 --> 45:39.988
I'll show you
who's a freak!

46:07.474 --> 46:09.184
Think objectively.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.020
Analyze. Analyze.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.856
Wait. Wait. That's it.

46:15.065 --> 46:16.691

46:16.858 --> 46:19.819

46:19.903 --> 46:22.322
Just take it easy, boy.

It's all right, Julie.
It's me, sweetheart.

47:45.989 --> 47:47.032
No.

47:47.657 --> 47:51.035
Please, Julie, please. Don't be afraid.
Listen to me.

47:52.287 --> 47:53.663
Who are you?

47:54.289 --> 47:56.791
It's me. Peyton.

47:57.459 --> 48:00.003
You are dead.

48:00.128 --> 48:03.006
No, no, Jules. No.

48:04.382 --> 48:07.927
I was in the hospital.
A coma. Dead to the world.

48:09.304 --> 48:10.805
Jules, please.

48:13.892 --> 48:16.394
Please. Please hold me.

48:18.730 --> 48:20.190
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

48:20.273 --> 48:23.193
I'm sorry. I didn't
know how to tell you.

48:24.736 --> 48:26.404
I needed to see you.

48:26.488 --> 48:29.073
I needed to know if things
could be the same.

48:29.157 --> 48:31.075
Yes. But, Peyton,
I don't understand.

48:32.243 --> 48:35.955
I know it's a shock. Well,
Julie, there's so much to it.

48:36.122 --> 48:39.959
And I'll tell you everything.
I just need a little time.

48:40.043 --> 48:42.962
Then just hold me, Peyton,
and don't let go.

48:43.296 --> 48:45.673
I just... I just need
a little time.

48:50.720 --> 48:55.266
All right, I understand why the doctors
said you shouldn't see me after the coma.

48:55.350 --> 48:57.143
That's their opinion.

48:57.977 --> 48:59.437
What's yours?

49:02.023 --> 49:06.402
I've got to have time to work
this out, Julie, on my own.

49:06.694 --> 49:09.197
But where does that
leave us, Peyton?

49:12.617 --> 49:15.161
I don't want to be
without you again.

49:15.370 --> 49:18.623
I need you, too, Jules.
That's why I'm here.

49:21.751 --> 49:23.086
It's just that I've...

49:23.169 --> 49:25.880
I feel like a rag doll all
pieced together, you know.

49:25.964 --> 49:27.924
My insides
are on my outside.

49:28.007 --> 49:29.968
If you could only see
how I feel inside.

49:30.051 --> 49:32.178
I was ashamed. Afraid.

49:32.887 --> 49:34.806
I was afraid that you
wouldn't want me anymore.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.933
Of course I still want you.

49:39.727 --> 49:40.937
Julie...

49:41.521 --> 49:43.523
Julie, what if I was hurt?

49:43.648 --> 49:45.650
Like...
Like horribly scarred.

49:45.733 --> 49:47.068
That you couldn't bear
to look at me anymore,

49:47.151 --> 49:50.697
you couldn't even bear to have me touch you.
What then, huh?

49:50.780 --> 49:51.865
Huh?

49:52.907 --> 49:54.367
I don't know.

49:55.076 --> 49:57.287
Honestly,
I don't know, Peyt.

49:58.913 --> 50:03.751
But why do you ask me that? I mean, look at you.
You're fine. And you're back.

50:06.504 --> 50:09.174
Yes. I am back, aren't I?

50:09.799 --> 50:11.426
Just like always.

50:23.771 --> 50:25.273
<i>What the hell
do you want, buddy?</i>

50:25.356 --> 50:28.651
The name isn't "buddy." It's
Durant, Robert G. Durant,

50:28.735 --> 50:30.737
and I wish to speak
to Mr. Guzman.

50:30.820 --> 50:32.363
<i>Okay.</i>
Thank you.

50:32.614 --> 50:35.950
<i>Hey, Rudy, there's some
asshole on the phone for you.</i>

50:36.618 --> 50:37.619
<i>Hey, Mr. Durant.</i>

50:37.702 --> 50:39.913
Ah, Rudy.
Pay attention.

50:39.996 --> 50:41.706
Don't speak. Listen.

50:41.789 --> 50:45.043
The funds Pauly misappropriated
are beginning to nettle me.

50:45.126 --> 50:47.795
He's caused a serious
cash flow problem.

50:48.004 --> 50:50.506
Did you receive certain monies
from Chinatown today?

50:50.590 --> 50:52.050
<i>No, not today.</i>

50:52.133 --> 50:55.553
Unfortunate. Then we shall
have to call upon Hung Fat.

50:56.346 --> 50:59.432
Either he provides
the revenues owed to us,

50:59.807 --> 51:02.310
or he becomes
part of my collection.

51:02.644 --> 51:04.479
It would make
a nice addition.

51:04.562 --> 51:05.939
<i>That's right.</i>

51:06.022 --> 51:10.193
<i>You want me to pick you up at your
place tomorrow morning around 8:30?</i>

51:10.276 --> 51:13.488
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

51:19.244 --> 51:20.828
That would be...

51:22.372 --> 51:23.706
just fine.

51:29.754 --> 51:32.924
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

51:36.469 --> 51:39.597
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

51:41.975 --> 51:44.978
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

51:47.855 --> 51:49.357
<i>That would be...</i>

51:50.817 --> 51:52.443
Just fine.

51:59.993 --> 52:02.120
<i>Would you like a bag
for this, please, buddy?</i>

52:02.203 --> 52:04.622
<i>That would be... just fine.</i>

52:05.707 --> 52:07.792
<i>Hey, hey,
take it easy, buddy.</i>

52:07.875 --> 52:09.627
<i>My name isn't "buddy."</i>

52:10.295 --> 52:11.713
<i>It's Durant.</i>

52:12.547 --> 52:14.924
<i>Robert G. Durant.</i>

52:16.217 --> 52:19.220
Yes, I'm Robert G. Durant.

52:26.394 --> 52:28.187
Just fine.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.157
Robert.

53:21.449 --> 53:26.120
It's so good of you to favor me
with your venerated presence.

53:26.204 --> 53:27.538
The money.

53:27.747 --> 53:29.957
The money?
Yes, Robert.

53:30.917 --> 53:33.211
How I tremble with shame.

53:33.628 --> 53:35.254
I have no money.

53:38.424 --> 53:39.592
How many times
do I have to tell you?

53:39.675 --> 53:42.553
I was nowhere near any
convenience store, you nitwit!

53:42.637 --> 53:46.224
Hey, I could barely get them to post bail.
They had the whole thing on video.

53:46.307 --> 53:48.101
Just keep them
out of my hair!

53:48.184 --> 53:50.561
I still need you to
sign those papers.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.230
Hey, where are
you going?

53:52.313 --> 53:54.565
Hong Kong restaurant,
and fast!

53:56.359 --> 54:00.321
White powder no longer flows
in its former volume.

54:00.488 --> 54:03.825
All the members of Tong
languish in poverty.

54:03.908 --> 54:08.830
Of all your unworthy servants,
Hung Fat is the most destitute.

54:09.038 --> 54:13.751
Even my own miserable slaves
sometimes ignore my wishes

54:13.876 --> 54:16.921
and upset those whom I
cherish most deeply.

54:17.338 --> 54:21.592
So, until that shining day,
may it soon come,

54:22.385 --> 54:26.472
when I shall once again
honor you with offerings.

54:27.682 --> 54:29.308
Goodbye, Robert.

54:30.685 --> 54:32.603
Robert, goodbye.

54:53.666 --> 54:57.587
You will provide the revenues owed to
us by the time I finish this cigar.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.132
But, Robert...

55:32.997 --> 55:35.625
Okay, Bob, you win.

55:46.761 --> 55:48.054
Damn! Drive!

55:48.137 --> 55:50.723
Can't go no further.
Sorry. It's a parade.

55:50.806 --> 55:51.807
I'll get there myself.

55:51.891 --> 55:53.142
Hey, what about
the fare?

55:53.226 --> 55:54.435
Eat it!

55:56.395 --> 55:57.522
Move!

55:57.647 --> 55:59.065
Move it!

56:04.195 --> 56:05.613
Where is he?

56:05.821 --> 56:07.573
Where's who?
Guzman!

56:08.199 --> 56:10.034
I thought he was with you.

56:10.117 --> 56:11.244
Shit!

56:21.462 --> 56:22.672
<i>Dios mío! Qué pasa?</i>

56:22.755 --> 56:25.258
There's two of those
son of bitches!

56:29.595 --> 56:30.972
Shoot him!

56:31.222 --> 56:32.515
Shoot him!

56:32.598 --> 56:33.891
Which one is Durant?

56:33.975 --> 56:35.309
Not me, him!

56:35.393 --> 56:36.727
Shoot him!

56:37.019 --> 56:38.354
Shoot him!

56:39.021 --> 56:40.606
Goddamn it!

56:41.607 --> 56:43.651
Whose little boy are you?

56:43.985 --> 56:45.653
It doesn't matter.

56:46.654 --> 56:48.072
You're dead!

56:49.156 --> 56:51.200
No, no. This one.

56:51.826 --> 56:53.744
Don't just stand there.

56:55.037 --> 56:56.330
Do something!

57:01.127 --> 57:05.464
Son of a bitch sets me up with the cops,
and you practically hand him the cash.

57:11.887 --> 57:13.222
<i>Madre mía!</i>

57:20.021 --> 57:21.897
Mr. Durant, I'm sorry.

57:54.555 --> 57:58.184
<i>Step right up and
take a spin on the amazing...</i>

58:19.955 --> 58:22.083
Come on! One more!

58:24.585 --> 58:27.880
Oh, would you stop looking at that watch?
To hell with time!

58:27.963 --> 58:30.049
Forget about going back
to the hospital, Peyton.

58:30.132 --> 58:33.636
We're going to spend the whole day together.
The whole night.

58:33.719 --> 58:36.681
I'd love to, honey. But you know I can't.
I've got my therapy, Jules.

58:36.764 --> 58:39.433
Oh, Peyton, we need
more time together.

58:39.892 --> 58:42.436
Tell me why you're
so uncomfortable with me?

58:44.897 --> 58:47.900
All right, Jules.
Listen to me.

58:52.363 --> 58:57.201
I got to tell you something
about me, how I've changed.

58:58.244 --> 58:59.412
When I was
in the hospital, I...

58:59.495 --> 59:01.705
See the mutant man,
ladies and gentlemen!

59:01.789 --> 59:04.166
Half man, half beast!

59:04.250 --> 59:08.879
Witness this cruel accident
of science with your own eyes.

59:13.884 --> 59:17.638
Everybody gather around and look closely.
As you can see...

59:17.805 --> 59:19.140
Peyt, what?

59:19.849 --> 59:21.600
Peyton, what is it?

59:25.813 --> 59:27.940
When I was
in the hospital,

59:28.232 --> 59:29.942
was there someone else?

59:30.025 --> 59:31.068
No.

59:31.944 --> 59:34.238
Yes. There was a man
who comforted me,

59:34.321 --> 59:36.115
and I respected him
for his kindness,

59:36.198 --> 59:38.075
but he means
nothing to me.

59:38.159 --> 59:42.037
Oh, Peyt, is that what it was?
Is that what it was, Peyt?

59:43.372 --> 59:46.083
God, I love you,
darling!

59:46.459 --> 59:48.419
Oh, it's good
to be back.

59:48.919 --> 59:50.588
Come on,
Julie Hastings,

59:50.671 --> 59:55.801
I'm going to win for you the biggest,
fuzziest, pinkest animal doll on that rack.

59:55.885 --> 59:57.011
Yes.
And then I got to run.

59:57.094 --> 59:58.095
Sir.

59:58.179 --> 01:00:02.016
You always have to run. Why does it
always have to be so dramatic?

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.976
I have my
hospital sessions, Jules.

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:07.021
I'm not a 100% cured yet,
but I soon will be.

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:11.108
Where is this place exactly?

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:12.777
Peyt, I want to be
involved somehow.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.987
Can I at least
take you back there?

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.740
No! No. Please, Julie,

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:19.783
I don't want you
to see me there.

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:25.331
I don't want you to think of me as
an invalid or some kind of a freak.

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:33.797
The pink
elephant, please.

01:00:33.881 --> 01:00:37.718
I'm sorry, buddy. It don't count
unless you're behind the line.

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:39.887
I was behind the line.

01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:41.388
Not hardly.

01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:44.099
I was standing right here
with my girlfriend.

01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:46.936
Now, the pink elephant,
if you please.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:49.980
No way.

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:56.529
It doesn't matter, Peyton.

01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:57.905
It matters.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.786
I won a pink elephant
for my girlfriend.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.624
Why don't you
just get lost, pal?

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.629
The elephant.

01:01:15.256 --> 01:01:16.465
Quickly.

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:19.176
Didn't you hear me,

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:21.929
weirdo?

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.935
Scram.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:49.290
Take it! Take it!
No.

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:51.584
Take the fucking elephant!

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:56.964
Please, no!
Forgive me.

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:03.137
Peyton, wait!

01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:07.558
Half man and a freak.

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:12.229
He's a freak, ladies and
gentlemen, he's a freak.

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:13.814
A freak.

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:33.917
Peyt.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.669
Peyton?

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:53.103
<i>Synthetic skin data analysis.</i>

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:59.943
<i>Amino acid content
equals 64%.</i>

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:06.992
<i>Membrane potential
equals 122 megavolts.</i>

01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:15.876
<i>Destabilization
registering at 99.008.</i>

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:22.216
Why didn't you
tell me, Peyton?

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:24.885
You should
have told me.

01:03:25.386 --> 01:03:29.056
You should have come to me, Peyt.
You didn't have to lie.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.061
Peyt.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.743
I would have tried
to help you.

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.289
I can help you now.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:00.879
You don't have to hide
from me anymore, Peyt.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.286
Julie.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.580
Louis, we have to talk.

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:36.957
Excellent.
I love to talk.

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:38.375
Brandy?

01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:39.543
No.

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:40.753
I'll have one.

01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:44.423
Fair warning, it's Napoleon,
and it's quite good.

01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:46.967
I can't see you anymore.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.388
Honey, take it easy.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.058
As you say, let's...
Let's talk.

01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:58.896
Louis, you know about Peyton,
the man I was involved with?

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:01.482
Of course.
He's alive.

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:02.941
He's back.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.113
I won't be a moment.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.244
Yes?

01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:18.874
Not now, Franz,
this is a bad time.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:23.087
The closing price?

01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:30.511
I think it's sufficiently
diversified.

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:33.972
Franz, it's immaterial to me
what the market is doing.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:35.849
I want you to buy.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.018
Ten thousand Krugerrands.

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:39.853
Fresh ones.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:51.031
Yes.
The Bellasarious memorandum.

01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:54.952
I'm sorry you had to
find that, Julie.

01:05:55.035 --> 01:05:58.205
Our relationship didn't need
this further strain.

01:05:59.748 --> 01:06:01.708
You burned Peyton's lab.

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:04.461
Not me personally.

01:06:05.212 --> 01:06:09.967
I have an employee who does certain things
for me, unofficially, off the books.

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:13.762
Robert doesn't like
to pay taxes.

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:17.933
And now you'll kill me.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:22.688
Hardly.

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:25.816
You have
nothing on me.

01:06:26.066 --> 01:06:30.445
You'd find the extremely expensive
police department quite unsympathetic.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:36.159
Julie, consider
the big picture.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:43.584
Consider what
we're building here.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.934
You and I, we're
building a city.

01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:05.230
We can't let anything
get in the way of that.

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:10.944
Despite the way
things might appear,

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:14.823
you can't pretend that certain
moments haven't passed between us.

01:07:14.907 --> 01:07:16.617
We still have that.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.873
If you're not
going to kill me,

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:26.126
I have things to do.

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:39.723
I suppose
this is goodbye then.

01:07:54.488 --> 01:07:55.572
Send Robert in.

01:07:55.656 --> 01:07:56.698
<i>Yes, Mr. Strack.</i>

01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:14.341
Robert, I have
good news and bad.

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:17.719
Custom dictates that you
render the bad news first.

01:08:19.388 --> 01:08:22.307
We have a little problem
with Miss Hastings.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:25.352
It appears she has
uncovered our alliance.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:28.354
No problem at all.
And the good news?

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.191
Your wife died.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.822
I'm joking, of course.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:41.158
No. The good news is that I know who's
behind our little troubles of late.

01:08:41.243 --> 01:08:45.872
When you retrieved my memorandum, you
failed to excise the good doctor.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.832
Westlake?

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:50.669
He's extinct.
I saw to it myself.

01:08:52.421 --> 01:08:53.796
He's alive.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:57.216
I don't like
loose ends, Robert.

01:08:57.426 --> 01:08:58.760
Finish it.

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:00.303
Where is he?

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.389
I believe
we have a guide.

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:29.750
Julie!

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.001
Peyton!

01:09:47.768 --> 01:09:49.019
Look out!

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:54.107
I think he's out here!

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.782
He just went
on the roof!

01:10:07.079 --> 01:10:08.580
Julie!

01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:26.032
Oh, you've got to be
shitting me.

01:11:28.827 --> 01:11:31.371
Hey, Smiley, he went
back into the warehouse, man!

01:11:31.455 --> 01:11:32.664
He's in here.

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:34.082
This door!

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:18.710
<i>System ready
for digitization program.</i>

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.255
<i>Data entry required.</i>

01:12:26.301 --> 01:12:28.094
Smiley, is that you?

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:32.390
Smiley.

01:12:36.311 --> 01:12:38.230
Where the hell are you?

01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:40.732
Close.

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.754
<i>Chinga tu madre!</i>
Smiley, is that you?

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.005
Don't shoot, Smiley!
It's Guzman!

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.435
Holy shit.

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:02.814
Good shooting.

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:14.117
Come here.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:19.372
You have been a bad boy.

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:25.128
Set it down.

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:27.005
Set it down!

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:30.925
If I want anything done, I guess
I'll have to do it myself.

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:34.721
Okay, Durant.

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:39.642
I'm going down there
to take care of that...

01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:43.063
Take it up! Take it up!

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:48.610
Take it up! Knock him off!

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.071
Get him off!

01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:11.216
Oh, shit!

01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:16.221
You're dead! You're dead!
You're dead!

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:27.273
<i>Holograph recognition active.</i>

01:15:42.247 --> 01:15:44.916
<i>Holographic imaging complete.</i>

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:05.895
You're next, Durant!
I'm coming for you!

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:08.106
Shake him.

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:42.223
What the hell was that?
Go after him!

01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:45.268
I got him!

01:16:47.395 --> 01:16:48.688
I got him! I got him!
I got him!

01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:58.031
Get away!

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:07.874
Get back!

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:10.668
Get back! He's mine!

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:17.133
Oh, shit!

01:17:20.762 --> 01:17:22.138
Excuse me.

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:34.400
<i>This is Police Air-12.</i>

01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:37.362
<i>Set down the man gently
then land your craft.</i>

01:17:37.445 --> 01:17:39.489
<i>Put down your craft!</i>

01:17:46.746 --> 01:17:47.997
Dip him.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:52.710
Look out!

01:18:08.935 --> 01:18:10.270
Watch it!

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:18.319
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

01:18:46.806 --> 01:18:48.099
Damn!

01:18:49.142 --> 01:18:50.894
Hold it steady.

01:19:03.573 --> 01:19:05.658
What the hell's
he up to?

01:19:10.705 --> 01:19:12.707
Kiss your ass goodbye!

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:16.127
No! No!

01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:25.470
Burn in hell!

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.791
You look
like hell, Robert.

01:19:54.874 --> 01:19:57.961
That son of a bitch Westlake
malfunctioned my helicopter.

01:19:58.044 --> 01:19:59.879
How terrible for you.

01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:01.714
He's a cockroach.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:05.885
You think you kill him, and
he pops up someplace else.

01:20:06.052 --> 01:20:08.388
I expect
he'll pop up here soon.

01:20:10.098 --> 01:20:12.892
See, I know how he thinks.

01:20:15.687 --> 01:20:19.232
I don't think the world will
grieve over one less attorney.

01:20:27.407 --> 01:20:31.661
It's the tragedy of my life
that I have to kill the ones I love.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:35.998
My wife, late wife,
held certain deeds.

01:20:36.791 --> 01:20:39.711
I sent her on a plane trip
over the Smokies.

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:44.007
Let's just say
I landed on my feet.

01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:55.893
I'm glad you survived,
Robert.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:59.772
I'd hate to see your kids
deprived of a role model.

01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:03.026
They do look up to me.

01:21:04.444 --> 01:21:06.112
When I was young,

01:21:06.446 --> 01:21:08.823
my father made me
work high steel!

01:21:09.407 --> 01:21:11.242
Just me and the Indians!

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:15.329
No one else crazy enough to run
around up here against the wind!

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.540
4.50 an hour!

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:22.128
Call me crazy,
sometimes I miss it!

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:24.297
Life on the edge!

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:29.802
Five inches wide,
650 feet down!

01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:41.355
High steel!

01:21:42.857 --> 01:21:46.944
Oh, by the way, you don't
have any kids, Robert.

01:21:53.493 --> 01:21:56.746
You truly are
one ugly son of a bitch.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:22:01.083
What do you think, Julie?
Who's the real monster here?

01:22:01.292 --> 01:22:04.212
I destroy to build
something better.

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:11.177
Whereas you, you're a man
who destroys for revenge.

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:13.221
Look.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.473
Look about you.

01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:18.392
It's all mine.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.563
Because I built it.

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:26.359
I built it all!

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.202
What have you got, besides a little
trouble with your complexion?

01:22:37.328 --> 01:22:39.163
I'm joking, of course.

01:22:39.247 --> 01:22:41.165
A troubled conscience?

01:22:42.834 --> 01:22:46.587
A little blood on your hands
from what you consider justice?

01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:47.797
Justice.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.801
You and I know it's just
another word for what I do.

01:22:52.677 --> 01:22:54.887
We should be
working together.

01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:56.639
I could use
a man like you.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.142
That's why
I brought you up here.

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:05.398
You can make a lot of
money working for me.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:09.110
But if you still want her,
I'll throw in Julie. Sound good?

01:23:10.278 --> 01:23:11.404
Oops.

01:23:33.801 --> 01:23:34.927
Pey...

01:23:36.262 --> 01:23:37.388
Bitch!

01:23:38.973 --> 01:23:40.182
Peyton!

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.113
There you go!

01:23:58.659 --> 01:23:59.994
Julie.

01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:01.454
Peyton?

01:24:07.877 --> 01:24:09.962
Come on.

01:24:35.947 --> 01:24:38.157
You're going down,
burn head!

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:52.380
Oh, no!

01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:54.423
Help me!

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:26.998
In your absence, I've gotten to
know Julie quite intimately.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.834
Her tastes are varied,

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:32.753
but I can tell you this,

01:25:33.004 --> 01:25:35.214
she doesn't date freaks.

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:48.227
Peyton!

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:49.770
Oh!

01:25:50.563 --> 01:25:51.605
Oh!

01:25:51.731 --> 01:25:53.524
Julie!

01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:26.098
Go ahead. Do it.
Do it, Westlake.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.434
But think of this.

01:26:29.018 --> 01:26:33.731
You let me die, and you
become as bad as me. Worse.

01:26:35.733 --> 01:26:37.068
You can't.

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:39.779
I know you too well.

01:26:41.072 --> 01:26:45.451
Dropping me is not really
an option for you.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.288
It's not something
you could live with.

01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:01.550
I'm learning to live
with a lot of things.

01:27:13.312 --> 01:27:14.730
Don't look at me.

01:27:14.814 --> 01:27:16.357
I want to look.

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:35.376
You'll perfect the skin. You'll make
it work. It doesn't matter.

01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:36.669
Julie.

01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:42.842
Don't you think I told myself that,
night after sleepless night?

01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:46.345
It's just a burn. Skin-deep.
It doesn't matter.

01:27:47.263 --> 01:27:49.014
And if I covered it,

01:27:49.515 --> 01:27:51.100
hid behind a mask,

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.853
you could love me
for who I was inside.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:56.063
Without pity.

01:27:58.524 --> 01:28:00.568
But a funny thing happened.

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:05.906
As I worked on the mask, I found
the man inside was changing.

01:28:06.657 --> 01:28:08.325
He became wrong.

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:11.328
A monster.

01:28:12.997 --> 01:28:16.208
I could live with it now,
but nobody else can.

01:28:32.892 --> 01:28:35.102
I want our life back.

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:45.738
Peyton!

01:28:51.243 --> 01:28:52.411
Peyton!

01:28:54.872 --> 01:28:56.415
Peyton is gone.

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:20.564
Peyt?

01:29:24.944 --> 01:29:25.986
Hey!

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:28.197
<i>I'm everyone.</i>

01:29:28.781 --> 01:29:30.241
<i>And no one.</i>

01:29:32.034 --> 01:29:33.410
<i>Everywhere.</i>

01:29:34.245 --> 01:29:35.454
<i>Nowhere.</i>

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:38.499
<i>Call me</i>

01:29:39.083 --> 01:29:40.292
<i>Darkman.</i>
