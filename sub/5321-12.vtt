to make it down here
on your own.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.649
Who is it?

37:46.800 --> 37:48.723
The Russians?

37:48.880 --> 37:51.087
The Chinese?

37:52.400 --> 37:54.562
Those rich bastards in Zona?

37:56.040 --> 37:57.724
(STRAINS)

37:57.920 --> 37:59.604
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.966
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.606
Never tried this before.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.922
(WHIRRING)

38:19.600 --> 38:24.162
What do you think an egg beater
can do to a man's face?

38:24.360 --> 38:26.931
Scramble it like a Picasso?

38:28.200 --> 38:29.929
Like my mother's chilaquiles?

38:30.080 --> 38:33.562
-(WHIRRING)
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

38:33.720 --> 38:36.326
-(GASPS)
- No.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.450
I like my mother's chilaquiles.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.445
Let's try this again.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.681
WOMAN: Jefe. It's Kurian.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.291
He needs to see La Reina.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.568
We've got some good news.

39:08.720 --> 39:11.371
Not for you, but it's good.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.082
Ugh! (COUGHS)

39:22.600 --> 39:25.570
(SLOW, TENSE TEX-MEX MUSIC)

39:45.520 --> 39:46.931
What do we do, guys?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.969
We gotta get out of here,
like, now.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.122
Yeah, well,
I would maybe know what to do

39:51.320 --> 39:53.209
if I knew what the hell
was going on.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.488
Yeah, did Vasquez really try
to kill that queen lady?

39:55.640 --> 39:57.244
No. Why would he do that?

39:57.400 --> 39:59.323
Yeah, and how was Warren
right there to stop him?

40:01.560 --> 40:03.403
I'm gonna go talk to her.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.006
Mi Reina.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.446
My Queen.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.570
Dr Kurian. What is it?

40:10.760 --> 40:12.285
I have it.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.044
I have the vaccine.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.404
The zombie plague is over.
I have the cure.

40:18.600 --> 40:22.764
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Tell me. What have you done?

40:22.920 --> 40:27.050
My Queen, I present to you...

40:27.200 --> 40:31.808
...your H1Z1 vaccine.

40:31.960 --> 40:36.045
This serum makes the zombie virus
virtually impotent.

40:36.240 --> 40:39.961
Now a zombie bite
will be like...nothing.

40:40.160 --> 40:44.609
Well, you may have to get
a tetanus shot. (CHUCKLES)

40:44.760 --> 40:46.285
And when you die?

40:46.440 --> 40:48.010
You stay dead.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.404
How do you know this works?

40:51.560 --> 40:53.767
- I’ve been testing it.
- On humans?

40:53.920 --> 40:56.730
- I...
- LA REINA: Show me.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.326
Show me how this works.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.644
Of course.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.487
I will just need a volunteer.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.407
I have just the man for you,
Dr Kurian.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.729
He's still alive?

41:17.880 --> 41:19.484
Not for long.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.290
LA REINA: He's perfect, then.

41:22.360 --> 41:26.524
Doctor, you have your volunteer.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.769
All ready, my Queen.

41:46.360 --> 41:47.805
My friends...

41:47.960 --> 41:50.167
...we stand on the precipice

41:50.360 --> 41:53.569
of a major scientific discovery.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.121
Remember this day,

41:56.320 --> 42:00.928
for it will mark the beginning
of a new world order.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.242
Of a Zero world order.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.165
(MUTTERS) More like
a Murphy world order.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.444
Let us proceed.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.408
Hold him still, goddamnit!

42:20.680 --> 42:22.170
What is his name?

42:22.320 --> 42:23.731
MURPHY: Vasquez.

42:23.880 --> 42:27.202
Javier. Something like that.

42:27.360 --> 42:29.488
Javier Vasquez,

42:29.640 --> 42:32.041
a name that will go down
in history.

42:36.320 --> 42:39.767
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

42:46.200 --> 42:48.885
