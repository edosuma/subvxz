the consequences.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.468
- What consequences?

00:10.552 --> 00:12.178
- Total loss of your powers.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.599
- For how long?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.893
- As long as we say so.
- Forever.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.895
- My father will have
something to say about this.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.648
- Your father can't
bail you out of this one.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.276
- And it's not really
you that we care about.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.737
Emma has been displaying some
conduct that's unbecoming

00:28.820 --> 00:31.114
of the Chosen One.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.534
- Your guardian can't save
you either, Miss Alonso.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.245
- So the Chosen One
loses her powers

00:37.328 --> 00:38.621
and so does what's-his-name.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.165

- Aye...

00:40.248 --> 00:41.332

00:41.416 --> 00:42.709
- Wait, I haven't
even voted yet.

00:42.792 --> 00:43.501

two out of three.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.587
Stand back, Lily.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.713

00:46.796 --> 00:48.047
Don't punish Emma.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.215
It was all me.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.092
ALL: What?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.302

00:55.221 --> 00:56.473

01:10.153 --> 01:12.572

01:18.077 --> 01:20.121
- And why would
you do such a thing?

01:20.205 --> 01:24.167
- Because I wanted a Chosen One
that I could control.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.127
- Oh, this is preposterous.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.713
Mr. Novoa is known
to lie and manipulate

01:28.797 --> 01:31.341

01:35.261 --> 01:37.180

- Yes.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.974
- I made the Emma clones,
and I'd do it again.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.018

01:42.101 --> 01:44.687
and so arrogant.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.731
You think we're fooling around?

01:46.815 --> 01:48.608
The Chosen One is free to go.

01:48.691 --> 01:49.943
- But--

01:51.778 --> 01:54.030
- Now you.

01:54.113 --> 01:57.700
Let's see how you fare
in the world without powers.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.244
He's broken the rules.

- You and Emma have
nothing in common.

10:34.633 --> 10:37.595
She's a powerful witch,
and you're...

10:37.678 --> 10:38.846
you.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.973
She needs me.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.224
- Needs you?

10:42.308 --> 10:45.061
You can't have done
anything good for her.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.896
- Like you have.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.939
- I broke the trophy case again

10:49.023 --> 10:52.068
so she wouldn't have to go to
detention all alone.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.154
- And I taught her how to
cast spells without talking.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.239
- I made it through
a weekend-long Sudoku-athon

10:57.323 --> 10:58.657
her dad organized.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.118
- And I reversed the punishment
spells the Council put on her.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.454
- I helped her defeat
the super-evil ex-principal

11:03.537 --> 11:04.789
who tried to steal her powers.

11:04.872 --> 11:08.000
- And I gave up my powers
to save hers.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.252
- You did what?

11:10.336 --> 11:11.087
- You heard me.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.755
Now beat that.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.135
Face it, Daniel, you
can't compete with me.

11:18.219 --> 11:18.803
- I'm not trying to.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.974
- Oh, and stay away from Emma.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.310
She's dating me now.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.189
- Sorry.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.611
- #SorryNotSorry.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.132
- Come out, T-3,
I know you're here.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.508
- I told you not
to use the laser.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.886
- Remote control
is the way to go.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.431
- Guys, this has got to stop.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.392
You can't be pulling
pranks on me all the time.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.810
- [voice scrambled]
We can.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.687
- We have plenty of supplies.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.981
- That's not what I meant.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.816
I know you're upset
Daniel broke up with me--

12:13.899 --> 12:14.859
- You broke his heart and--

12:16.277 --> 12:18.487
Wait.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.823
Daniel broke up with you?

12:20.906 --> 12:24.160
- What are you saying exactly?

12:24.243 --> 12:26.036
- I thought you knew.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.830
Daniel broke up with me.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.748
So, if you want to blame
someone, blame him.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.674
- You guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

12:38.757 --> 12:41.844
- Add Daniel
to the ultimate prank list.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.264
- I got her, I got her...maybe.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.265
Let's go, team!

12:46.348 --> 12:48.517
I'm open!

12:48.601 --> 12:49.477
Wrong way.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.644
Got it, got it.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.730
Come on, I'm open, I'm open.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.148
Me!

12:59.278 --> 13:01.947
- Oh, hey, Lily.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.240
I wasn't expecting you.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.201
Did you make an appointment?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.744
- What is all this?

13:06.827 --> 13:07.995
- Oh, that's part of the turbine
I'm building for Hex,

13:08.078 --> 13:10.623
you know, to give
him some extra oomph.

13:10.706 --> 13:11.540
- [sighs]
Where are all my things?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.502
- It's around here.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.044
Or in a box in my basement.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.046
- What?

13:17.129 --> 13:17.713
- Nothing.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.632
Is something wrong?

13:19.715 --> 13:21.175
You have that crease between
your eyebrows

13:21.258 --> 13:22.426
you get when you're nervous.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.303
- I don't get a crease.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.349
Okay, maybe I do.

13:28.432 --> 13:29.725
I've got a bad feeling, Andi.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.561
Desdemona seems determined
to take Emma's powers,

13:32.645 --> 13:34.563
a little too determined.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.315
- Well, how can you tell?

13:36.398 --> 13:37.566
I mean, it seems like
Desdemona's

13:37.650 --> 13:39.068
just always crazy intense.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.402
It might just be
her natural state.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.529
- No.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.906
She's different
than she used to be--

13:43.989 --> 13:46.450
much more unstable
and dangerous.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.410
What are you looking at?

13:48.494 --> 13:49.620
- Oh, I'm sorry.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.454
But you have a little...

13:50.538 --> 13:53.457
- Oh, did I get it?

13:53.541 --> 13:55.417
- There, you got it.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.127
- Thanks.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.921
I've been checking the records
at the Council,

13:59.004 --> 14:00.881
and during the last Fool Moon,

14:00.965 --> 14:04.009
somebody
did try to end the Realm.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.886
But there's little
information about it.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.555
- And you suspect Desdemona?

14:08.889 --> 14:10.307
Well, we weren't gonna
say anything,

14:10.391 --> 14:13.394
but, you know, Gigi's actually
been acting really weird lately.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.979
I mean, weirder than usual.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.280
- Jax, Daniel, stop!

14:24.363 --> 14:26.657
Stop, please!

14:26.740 --> 14:27.449
- Not so easy without
your powers, is it?

14:27.533 --> 14:28.867
- Daniel, stop!

14:32.413 --> 14:34.790
Before this turns bitter,
cool them off with some glitter.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.794
- What the--

14:40.087 --> 14:41.922
- Sorry, guys, but it was
the only way to get you

14:42.006 --> 14:44.174
to stop fighting.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.634
Can we go now?

14:46.760 --> 14:48.345
- You better watch out.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.638
I'll get my powers back.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.641
- And I'll get my girl back.

14:56.604 --> 15:00.149
- No, no, no!

15:03.360 --> 15:06.322
No, no, no!

15:06.405 --> 15:08.240
What happened here?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.326
Opening night is next Friday.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.578
This is a sparkling mess.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.163
- Oh, don't worry.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.166
I'm sure Andi has
a turbo-powered vacuum cleaner

15:17.249 --> 15:18.792
that'll clean this right up.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.670
- Oh, that'll
solve <i> this</i> problem.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.756
But Emma and Daniel
are still broken up.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.382
And it appears

15:25.466 --> 15:28.761
that she is
with that wizard menace Jax.

15:28.844 --> 15:29.845
- I know.

15:29.928 --> 15:30.929
And did you see
how jealous Daniel was?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.808
- That's it.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.187
I just have to make
Emma jealous of Daniel.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.689
And then their mutual jealously
will drive them

15:40.773 --> 15:41.106
towards each other.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.653
- Director Desdemona,
I need your help.

15:45.736 --> 15:46.862
- What is it?

15:46.945 --> 15:49.239
- Which playing-dead pose
do you like better?

15:53.869 --> 15:53.994
Or?

15:57.748 --> 16:01.085
- I think I like
the second one better.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.378
- Me too.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.254
- But you need to work on it
a little bit

16:04.338 --> 16:06.632
so that we can
really feel the emotion.

16:06.715 --> 16:07.591
- There is no emotion.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.551
She's playing dead.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.679
[zapping]

16:13.305 --> 16:15.391
- You should spend the weekend
with Daniel

16:15.474 --> 16:18.185
so that you can really work
on your connection.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.645
- That's a great idea.

16:19.728 --> 16:24.108
Oh, but I have Katie's surprise
birthday party on Saturday.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.651
- Perfect.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.069
Bring him as your date.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.613
And then you two can act
as if you were in love

16:29.697 --> 16:32.741
like Romeo and Juliet.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.992
- I love it.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.704
You're a genius,
Director Desdemona.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.123
- [laughs]
I am, aren't I?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.588
- Katie?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.632
What are you doing?

16:48.716 --> 16:50.843
I said, what are you doing?

16:52.261 --> 16:54.847
- I'm a Goth chic now.
We don't talk.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.348
We just give dirty looks.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.975
Now, if you'll excuse me.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.393
[scoffs]

16:59.476 --> 17:00.644
- You're out of control.

17:00.728 --> 17:04.147
As head Panther, I order
you to cut the shenanigans.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.483
- I'm not a Panther anymore,
so I don't have to listen

17:06.567 --> 17:08.026
to anything you say.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.611
- [gasps]

17:09.694 --> 17:13.281
But--but you're still coming to
the beach this weekend, right?

17:13.365 --> 17:17.661
To, uh, celebrate,
uh, Sophie's play?

17:17.744 --> 17:18.912
- Dream on.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.123
I've got more important things
to celebrate

17:21.205 --> 17:22.875
with my new friends.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.381
- Was that Katie?

17:29.465 --> 17:32.593
- This surprise party better
be worth this whole charade.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.470
How are you doing
on the guest list?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.722
- Uh, the Sharks
are coming, Gigi,

17:36.805 --> 17:37.931
and a few people said
they'd come

17:38.015 --> 17:40.267
if you promise not
to dump smoothies on them.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.102
- How can they expect me to
promise something like that?

17:44.104 --> 17:46.315
[sighs]
Okay, fine.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.323
- Council entrance.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.992
Council entrance, where is it?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.661
Aha!

17:59.745 --> 18:01.413
Nurse Lily.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.344
I need a magic device.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.016
Where's the magic tablet?

18:24.102 --> 18:26.230
DESDEMONA:
Go home, minion.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.898
I'll stay behind and lock up.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.399
- Desdemona, no.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.366
Get to the Council
entrance, Ramona.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.534
Get there.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.828
- Yes, Ramona, get there.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.204
- Almost there.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.164
- Almost.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.916
- Desdemona?

18:45.999 --> 18:46.959
- Yes?

18:47.042 --> 18:50.379
- [whimpers]
So close.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.172
- [laughs]

18:52.256 --> 18:53.215
Oh.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.065
- Hey, Em, do you have any
nontoxic pie--

19:10.148 --> 19:12.442
- Andi, I'm glad you're here.

19:12.526 --> 19:16.530
We were just telling Emma that
she needs to be extra cautious

19:16.613 --> 19:18.615
this last week of the Fool Moon.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.783
She'll need your help.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.952
- Oh, anything
for the Council, man.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.829
Which weapon should I bring?

19:23.912 --> 19:25.414
My baseball bat?

19:25.497 --> 19:26.415
My bow and arrow?

19:26.498 --> 19:28.500
[gasps]
My samurai swords?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.460
- You own samurai swords?

19:30.544 --> 19:31.753
- Not yet.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.673
But I could have them
shipped overnight express.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.300
- Why do we have
to be cautious?

19:36.383 --> 19:37.426
- [exhales sharply]

19:37.509 --> 19:38.760
This is the final lead-up

19:38.844 --> 19:40.637
to the last light
of the Fool Moon,

19:40.721 --> 19:43.098
at which time,
almost anything is possible.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.602
- And we think
that something big...

19:46.685 --> 19:47.853
and bad could be
in the works.

19:47.936 --> 19:51.273
- Which is why Desdemona
has been posing as your teacher.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.567
- Speaking of Desdemona,

19:53.650 --> 19:54.943
how do you think
she's been doing?

19:55.027 --> 19:58.280
You know, helping you and
protecting you and everything?

19:58.363 --> 20:00.240
- She's been really good,
actually.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.284
She's been helping me
with my spells,

20:02.367 --> 20:03.911
answering any questions
that I have,

20:03.994 --> 20:05.954
trying to get me and Daniel
back to--

20:06.038 --> 20:08.415
- Trying to get you
and Daniel back to what?

20:08.498 --> 20:10.792
- Back to, uh...

20:10.876 --> 20:12.920
being in separate gym classes.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.504
- But now
that Agamemnon's around,

20:14.588 --> 20:16.423
do you think
you need Desdemona, too?

20:16.506 --> 20:19.134
- I-I do think
I still need her...

20:19.217 --> 20:21.261
if the Council can spare her.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.346
- Okay, just--

20:22.429 --> 20:26.141
Like I said,
just be extra cautious...

20:26.224 --> 20:26.725
of everyone.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.977
- I will.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.354
- And, hey, I mean,
if the Witches Council

20:30.437 --> 20:31.813
has other duties,
I can guard Emma.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.148
I will need a few bucks

20:33.231 --> 20:36.193
for those samurai swords,
though.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.822
- Okay, so, in this scene,

20:40.906 --> 20:43.492
Daniel and Jax both enter

20:43.575 --> 20:46.662
from opposite sides
of the stage.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.831
So the dump bucket
needs to be...

20:49.915 --> 20:51.333
here.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.668
- Excellent.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.419
- We'll use a remote
to operate the bucket.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.382
- This will be epic.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.509
- Our biggest audience yet.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.887
- It's gonna be
our best prank ever.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.685
- Emma, hi, you came.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.103
- Diego texted me all night.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.522
Plus, Katie's not that bad.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.898
She helped me defeat
the principal,

21:14.982 --> 21:16.566
so I guess we're...

21:16.650 --> 21:18.068
friends.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.070
- Remember that last time
we were here,

21:20.153 --> 21:22.155
and it was like--
- Hey, Emma.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.907
I found a good
spot near the surf for us.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.368
Daniel.
- Thanks.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.203
- You came to the party
with Jax?

21:28.286 --> 21:29.454
- Of course she did.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.206
- Jax.

21:31.289 --> 21:32.165
- If you came alone and want to
sit with us,

21:32.249 --> 21:33.875
you're more than welcome to.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.045
- He's not alone.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.505
- Sophie?
- I'm his date.
