00:05.273 --> 00:08.142
[Lauren] Previously
on Make It Or Break It:

00:09.110 --> 00:10.378
I'm scared of gymnastics.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.447
I'm glad I'm here to see you
cancel this little
ego trip of yours.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.816
Girls would've been
decimated, anyway.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.519
- [Payson] Trust.
- [Sasha] You can do this.

00:18.552 --> 00:22.556
[male announcer] The Rock
stuns the gymnastics world
by winning five medals today.

00:22.590 --> 00:26.394
These girls clearly
should've been taken
to Beijing.

00:26.427 --> 00:30.498
- Anything you want to say?
- It's not over, Belov.
Far from it.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.467
[man] You're leaving
for a six-month
European tour tonight.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.203
[Damon] This is for you, Emily.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.370
Guess you really are
letting me go.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.307
He's gonna think I didn't
care enough to say goodbye.

00:39.340 --> 00:44.145
I love you. Let's just put
the stupid stuff behind us
and be together.

00:44.178 --> 00:48.149
[Kaylie] I want you
to come to my room tonight.
I'll be waiting for you.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.520
[rock music playing]

01:01.529 --> 01:03.531
All right, Emily,
show me who's in control!

01:08.636 --> 01:12.240
[man] Awesome! Awesome.
Nice, keep it straight...

01:13.574 --> 01:14.375
All right, come on, Emily!

01:16.210 --> 01:19.079
Bring it! Give me power.
Show me power.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.521
- [camera shutter clicking]
- Emily, that was smokin' hot.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.357
Lauren,
show me what you got!

01:38.266 --> 01:41.169
- Burn up that beam!
- [shutter clicking]

01:41.202 --> 01:43.571
Nice, Lauren!
Let's have a strong finish.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.544
[chuckling] That was sick!

01:50.578 --> 01:53.247
All right, Kaylie,
Take it home.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.619
- [shutter clicking]
- Yes!

02:03.924 --> 02:08.162
[chuckling]
That was off the hook!

02:08.196 --> 02:11.165
Now all together
in front of the green screen
for the cover shot.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.334
OK, ladies,
lots of attitude.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.603
You're the "Rock Rebels,"
fierce and fabulous!

02:21.209 --> 02:22.376
[grunting]

02:25.479 --> 02:27.448
- How's it going?
- Good.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.551
The Tsuk Arabian is one
of my best vaults.
I'll get it back.

02:30.584 --> 02:34.588
[man] Lots of attitude now.
You're daring, dangerous divas!

02:34.622 --> 02:38.492
[groans] Must be
kind of hard to concentrate
with the circus in town.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.261
Hope you don't feel left out.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.596
I'll get plenty of attention
when I win Worlds this year.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.698
- Worlds.
- That's right.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.435
Oh, OK. Well, I guess
they better watch out.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.537
The most dangerous diva
of all is back.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.239
[chuckling]

02:51.639 --> 02:53.207
We're both back.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.742
I'm really glad you're
managing The Rock again.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.611
Well, co-managing,
with Summer.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.213
- I'm glad, too.
- Here we go.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.581
- Come on.
- One more.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.584
I wish I could see
the look on Ellen Beals'
face when she picks up

03:03.617 --> 03:05.586
the number one gymnastics
magazine in the country

03:05.619 --> 03:08.256
and sees the "Rock Rebels"
on the cover.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.358
- What do you think of us now...
- [together] Biatch.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.959
[man] That's it,
own it, ladies.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.262
I'll just be happy if they
reinstate my scholarship.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.331
- When they reinstate it.
- Emily, chill.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.632
You won two medals
against China.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.633
You don't have to play
"poor little girl

03:19.667 --> 03:21.535
from the other side
of the tracks" anymore.

03:21.569 --> 03:24.672
She's right. You are ranked
number two at The Rock now.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.576
- Hold it right there!
Gorgeous!
- [shutter clicking]

03:28.609 --> 03:31.645
Only because I hurt my ankle
before the last rotation.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.615
- I'll blow you away in France.
- [shutter clicking]

03:34.648 --> 03:37.751
- Hey, Summer.
- Oh, I am so glad
you're back.

03:37.785 --> 03:41.622
We are swamped with all
the kids that want to train
at the "Rebel Rock."

03:41.655 --> 03:44.292
Oh, have you seen the latest?

03:45.626 --> 03:48.529
"Rock Rebels Rule Gymnastics."

03:48.562 --> 03:51.665
- Pretty cool!
- Oh, yeah.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.268
Listen, I hate to rain
on the fun parade

03:54.302 --> 03:56.537
but has anyone actually heard
from the National Committee?

03:56.570 --> 03:59.407
The French Invitational
is next week.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.643
Normally we would've heard
about travel arrangements
way before now.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.578
Sasha's not worried.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.547
We proved they took
the wrong girls to China

04:06.580 --> 04:08.482
and they're not gonna
make that mistake again.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.351
Don't be so sure.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.286
We embarrassed them.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.456
And there are some people
over at the NGO who can be
very vengeful.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.425
I can't believe
we're going to France.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.560
I've never even been
out of the country.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.496
- I don't even have a passport.
- Who doesn't have a passport?

04:22.530 --> 04:24.565
About 90 percent
of the world.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.468
Hey, Emily, isn't Damon
touring with Green Day
in Europe?

04:27.501 --> 04:30.037
What if your boyfriend
is in France when we are?

04:30.070 --> 04:32.740
He's not my boyfriend.
And I have no idea
where he is.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.576
Don't you at least want him to
know you tried to say goodbye?

04:35.609 --> 04:39.613
If he thinks you blew him off,
he might give up on you.

04:39.647 --> 04:40.614
For good.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.324
Carter still hasn't
called you back?

04:50.358 --> 04:52.493
- You called Carter?
- I don't want
to talk about it.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.627
Hey, focus, ladies!

04:55.563 --> 04:57.465
Ah, the sweet smell
of success.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.700
Let's not get too intoxicated.
It's time to practice.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.870
[chuckling] Coach Belov,
can I just get one shot
of you with the girls?

05:02.903 --> 05:06.607
Um... No, thank you.
They deserve
all the limelight.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.443
Oh, come on! We wouldn't be
the Rebel Rock without you!

05:09.477 --> 05:11.712
She's right. You're responsible
for all of this.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.648
He was just doing his job.
We did the hard part.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.451
Come and enjoy the spoils
of victory with us!

05:17.485 --> 05:19.453
- [all chuckling]
- Let's go a little wider.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.889
- Excuse me.
- [man] All right.
Give it to me!

05:21.922 --> 05:24.358
Beautiful!

05:24.392 --> 05:26.760
Loving it! Nice.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.762
- Can you stop?
- You wish.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.831
- Um, you guys?
- [man] Emily?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.501
More attitude! Like you
just flipped the bird

05:33.534 --> 05:35.769
to the gymnastics
establishment snobs.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.805
Ellen Beals is here.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.776
Miss Beals?
So glad you're here.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.380
We've been training very hard
for the French Invitational.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.648
I can see that.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.383
I hope you're here about
the travel arrangements.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.785
I told my gym manager
not to worry but
she likes to plan ahead.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.687
You're right,
she shouldn't worry.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.155
Because the girls
aren't going to France.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.793
In fact, you're all suspended
from the National Team
until further notice.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.724
You can't suspend us!

06:30.758 --> 06:33.527
You chose to compete
in a non-sanctioned
international event.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.697
- It was a club meet.
- Against the Chinese
National Team.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.432
Technically,
they breached their contracts.

06:38.466 --> 06:42.736
But surely you knew that, Belov.
I tried to warn you.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.639
But you ignored my advice
and chose to trust your coach

06:45.673 --> 06:49.510
and these are the consequences.
I'm sorry, girls.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.845
Belov, I'll let you get back
to your photo shoot.

06:51.879 --> 06:55.583
And you could use
a little powder.
I think you're sweating.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.554
I can't believe this!

07:02.022 --> 07:04.658
- What are we gonna do?
- Call their bluff.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.126
You think
they're bluffing?

07:06.159 --> 07:07.995
You girls are going to France.
They're just trying
to make you sweat.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.464
- Why?
- Because you stood up to them

07:10.498 --> 07:12.866
when you went through
with the China meet
in spite of their threats.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.802
And by out-medaling
the girls they took to China,

07:14.835 --> 07:17.805
you proved you're the best.
But they don't want you
empowered,

07:17.838 --> 07:21.008
they want you intimidated so
they can make or break your
careers as they see fit.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.677
But I say, it's not
up to them to decide
who gets to win or lose.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.647
It's up to you. And if
you work the hardest
and you're the best

07:26.680 --> 07:28.649
then you should get
the opportunities to win.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.053
OK. So what do we do?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.725
Nothing. They're
going to back down

07:37.758 --> 07:39.660
and they're going
to take you to France.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.629
And as long as we don't panic
and go begging for forgiveness

07:41.662 --> 07:44.732
you'll go there with
all the respect
you've earned

07:44.765 --> 07:46.967
and your fate
in your own hands.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.537
- Trust me.
- We do.

07:49.570 --> 07:53.941
But we must stand strong
and all stand together.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.777
- Agreed?
- [together] Yes, Sasha.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.914
All right, then.
Everyone in France is going
to be looking at you.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.016
Everyone's gonna be
afraid of you and
we don't wanna disappoint.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.052
So get changed and let's
get back to practice.

08:11.024 --> 08:15.596
Sasha! I'm just wondering
about my scholarship.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.532
If they're bluffing,
do you think they'll still
reinstate it?

08:18.566 --> 08:19.600
I hope not.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.570
The whole point of this is
so they don't own you.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.672
Which is why I've been
trying to find you
an independent scholarship.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.674
I still have to work
at Pizza Shack then.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.942
- Is that a problem?
- Not for the time being.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.778
You just hang tight, OK?

08:36.684 --> 08:38.051
Are we sure Sasha's right?

08:38.085 --> 08:39.687
Of course he is.
He hasn't been wrong yet.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.755
[Kaylie] We can't
miss this meet in France.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.925
- It's probably the biggest
meet before Worlds.
- Trust Sasha.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.761
You're going to France
and you're going
to Worlds. We all are.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.764
Payson, you need to be
on the National Team
to go to Worlds.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.000
That's why I'm asking
to be petitioned on.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.002
Petitioned
on the National Team?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.604
They've made exceptions
a few times

08:56.637 --> 08:58.706
for top ranked gymnasts
who've come back from injuries

08:58.739 --> 09:00.641
between national competitions.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.977
- What does that take?
- Well, if they agree
to consider my petition,

09:04.011 --> 09:07.114
I just have to perform in front
of the entire National Committee

09:07.147 --> 09:09.116
and then they vote on whether
or not to put me on the team.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.720
Wow. I think
that's great, Pay.

09:12.753 --> 09:16.089
And Sasha's right.
We have everything to gain
and nothing to lose

09:16.123 --> 09:18.792
as long
as we don't cave. OK?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.862
Before we call it a wrap,
uh, can I just get
a few more shots?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.865
- Sure.
- Just of Kaylie, sweetheart.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.135
Come on, Kaylie, you are
the best gymnast in America.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.803
Let me see you own it!

09:29.837 --> 09:33.807
- Can you believe that?
- She is the National Champion.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.710
- Until I beat her next year.
- Or I beat her.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.913
Kaylie doesn't always
get everything.

09:57.898 --> 10:01.702
Do you really think Payson's
ready to be petitioned back
on the National Team?

10:01.735 --> 10:05.973
I mean, I've been watching her
practice and she's definitely
lost some skills.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.909
I wouldn't underestimate
Payson Keeler.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.112
They said she'd never do
gymnastics again
and look at her.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.716
Well, aren't you worried
she might beat you
at Nationals next year?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.117
And what about you, Emily?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.052
There's only 12 spots
on the team.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.088
And if Payson
gets petitioned back on,

10:21.121 --> 10:23.791
that means somebody's
getting booted off.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.926
And you did come in
last at Nationals.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.895
So, I mean, I'm guessing
that would be you.

10:27.928 --> 10:31.131
So, what should we do?
Hit her in the knees
with a baseball bat?

10:31.164 --> 10:34.201
Where is my mother?

10:34.234 --> 10:36.804
She's supposed to be
picking me up.
I have to work tonight.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.071
With Carter?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.640
Why? What's going on?

10:42.710 --> 10:46.146
The night of the China meet,
after you told me
that Carter loved me

10:46.179 --> 10:50.417
and I should forgive him,
I left him a message
saying I wanted him back

10:50.450 --> 10:51.719
and to come over...

10:51.752 --> 10:55.856
...but he never showed up
and he's been
avoiding me ever since.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.794
I mean, if he doesn't love me
anymore why can't he just
say it to my face?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.830
Maybe he does still
love you.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.966
Or maybe he doesn't
but he doesn't want
to hurt your feelings.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.702
- Did he tell you that?
- No. I haven't
spoken to Carter

11:08.736 --> 11:10.804
since he moved out
of our garage apartment.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.473
I wonder why he can't just
tell me what's up?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.209
[sighing]
It's driving me crazy.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.854
Suspended?! For how long?

11:26.887 --> 11:30.858
Indefinitely.
Which means I can kiss
my scholarship goodbye.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.895
- Is that a new dress?
- Yeah, do you like it?

11:34.928 --> 11:38.131
Mom, we're a week behind
on rent. What are you
doing shopping?

11:38.165 --> 11:41.168
It's not for me,
it's for Mr. Steve Tanner.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.937
And when he sees me in it
I think he'll be
more than happy

11:43.971 --> 11:45.505
to help us pay the rent
this month.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.876
We are not taking money
from Steve Tanner!

11:48.909 --> 11:53.513
Honey, your scholarship
was half of our income.

11:53.546 --> 11:57.117
And we'll find another way
to get by. I'm serious.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.020
I don't want Steve Tanner
or the National Committee

12:00.053 --> 12:02.823
or anyone else
thinking they own us.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.992
Don't you want him
to respect you?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.794
He does respect me, Emily.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.296
He won't if he thinks
he can buy you.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.832
Let's face it, you've
been there and done that

12:11.865 --> 12:12.833
and look where it got you.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.034
Nowhere.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.838
I don't think that
I'm nowhere, Emily.

12:17.871 --> 12:22.242
But don't you worry.
We won't take any money
from the Tanners.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.813
Have you seen my stilettos?
Where are they?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.781
- Oh, there's one.
- [Emily] Promise me.

12:27.815 --> 12:31.518
I don't want to be humiliated
in front of Lauren and
everyone else at the gym.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.121
- Found them!
- Mom.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.123
I promise, Emily.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.830
[dings]

12:46.266 --> 12:47.267
So, what's the deal?

12:50.603 --> 12:53.807
I know you got my message.
Why didn't you ever
call me back?

12:53.841 --> 12:56.810
Look, I just need to know.
What's going on?

13:09.022 --> 13:11.358
Look, I know I've pushed and
pulled you back and forth

13:11.391 --> 13:17.064
and I can understand
why you didn't come running
when I called, but...

13:17.097 --> 13:20.233
...I know what I want now
and I can forgive you
for sleeping with Lauren...

13:20.267 --> 13:22.235
- Kaylie...
- If you could just
give us another chance...

13:22.269 --> 13:25.805
- It's too late.
- Why? Why is it too late?

13:28.876 --> 13:33.113
- You don't love me anymore?
- I'll always love you,
it's just...

13:33.146 --> 13:35.983
- I think we're better
as friends.
- We were always friends...

13:36.016 --> 13:38.218
Just friends.

13:42.189 --> 13:46.193
Is, um... is there
something you're not
telling me?

13:46.226 --> 13:48.595
Look...

13:48.628 --> 13:53.066
All I know to tell you
right now is that it's over.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.272
OK. Um...

13:59.306 --> 14:01.041
Wow.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.378
If that's how you feel.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.350
Excuse me, I need to use
the ladies' room.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.259
[phone ringing]

14:20.427 --> 14:22.896
Pizza Shack,
how can I service
your hunger attack?

14:22.930 --> 14:24.331
[Lauren] You can turn around.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.066
Lauren?

14:29.469 --> 14:32.005
God! What are you doing?!

14:32.039 --> 14:36.243
- I'm seducing you,
Mr. Anderson.
- Well, don't!

14:36.276 --> 14:38.678
- [exhaling]
- I thought you'd like it.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.149
I do. I would. But...

14:43.283 --> 14:45.018
...Kaylie's here.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.054
- What is she doing here?
- Uh...

14:47.087 --> 14:49.356
- She wants to know why
I've been avoiding her.
- Why have you been?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.324
I mean, why haven't you
just told her it's over?

14:51.358 --> 14:53.393
- I just did.
- You did?

14:53.426 --> 14:54.194
You didn't tell her why,
did you?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.396
That I'm sleeping with you?
No.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.131
But she asked
if there was something
I'm not telling her.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.667
If you tell her,
she'll hate me and I'll
lose my best friend.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.136
She's not your best friend
if you're lying to her.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.239
We both know secrets
hurt more than the truth.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.208
So, you need
to make a decision:

15:08.241 --> 15:10.243
either your friendship
with Kaylie or your
relationship with me.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.279
Why can't I have both?

15:12.312 --> 15:14.214
Because I still care
about Kaylie

15:14.247 --> 15:16.383
and I don't want
to lie to her.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.219
You've gotta go
before she sees you.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.288
- Will I see you tonight?
- Yes!

15:21.321 --> 15:24.124
OK. Wait a second.
[sighing]

15:27.394 --> 15:29.396
Toss this in the
Dumpster, would you?

15:39.539 --> 15:44.211
- Can someone take our order?
- Sorry, be right there.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.380
OK...

15:48.548 --> 15:51.251
- Kaylie...
- At least you were honest.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.723
Oh, hey. I was just driving by
and I saw your car.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.525
[woman] Can we get
some service, please?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.393
[Carter] Yeah, coming.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.762
Why are you wearing
a trench coat?
Is it raining?

16:02.795 --> 16:06.233
No, I was chilly.
Are you OK? What did he say?

16:07.467 --> 16:08.768
It's really over.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.571
[sighing]
Honey, I'm so sorry.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.177
[Emily] Is everything OK?

16:17.210 --> 16:20.213
She talked to Carter
and he's over her.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.282
Oh, Kaylie, I'm so sorry.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.384
I feel like an idiot.
I just gotta go.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.986
I'll call you later,
sweetie.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.457
- Is it supposed to rain?
- How should I know?

16:30.490 --> 16:34.294
So, thanks for giving my dad
permission to date your mom.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.164
I was under the impression
you thought he wasn't
good enough for her.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.565
It doesn't matter
what I think of your father.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.801
If my mom likes him
for some reason, then
that's none of my business.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.437
Oh, I know the "reason."
Ka-ching!

16:44.471 --> 16:47.140
Did you hear that?
It's the sound of my father

16:47.174 --> 16:49.176
slipping his money into
your mother's g-string.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.312
It'll be a cold day in hell
before my family takes
as much as a postage stamp

16:52.345 --> 16:54.181
from your father.

16:54.214 --> 16:57.350
Well, with all this
climate change, anywhere
could freeze over.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.355
OK, OK. I'm going!

17:09.329 --> 17:10.497
[classical music playing]

17:13.366 --> 17:17.404
Whoo! This place is
a little spendy, isn't it?

17:17.437 --> 17:21.074
Well, I'm paying,
so you don't have to worry.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.510
No, I know, I just
feel a little funny

17:23.543 --> 17:26.313
eating at such an expensive
restaurant when...

17:26.346 --> 17:28.281
- When what?
- Nothing.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.485
Are you having some
financial problems?

17:32.519 --> 17:35.322
Oh, honey, we're always
having financial problems.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.225
Especially since Emily
lost her scholarship.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.094
- But we'll be fine.
- You know, I'd be happy
to help you out.

17:41.128 --> 17:45.498
I appreciate that, Steve.
But I want you to respect me.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.135
- I do.
- Emily doesn't think
that you do,

17:48.168 --> 17:51.571
or will, if we take
any money from you.
And she's right.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.242
Look at my past.
Every man I've ever dated
has either lent me money

17:55.275 --> 17:59.612
or stolen it from me
and where has that
gotten me? Nowhere.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.515
- I don't think you're nowhere.
- Well, Emily does.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.451
And to be honest...

18:04.484 --> 18:07.387
...I really want my daughter
to respect me, too.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.423
So, Steve,
I would appreciate it

18:10.457 --> 18:12.659
if you kept your money
in your pocket.

18:12.692 --> 18:16.863
OK. I will keep
my money in my pocket.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.332
- [gasping]
- [both chuckle]

18:21.168 --> 18:23.136
There is one thing
you can help me with, though.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.472
I'm not exactly sure
how to navigate

18:25.505 --> 18:28.408
all the politics
of this sport, so...

18:28.441 --> 18:31.311
Do you think they're
really serious when
they say they're gonna

18:31.344 --> 18:34.181
suspend the girls
from the National Team?

18:34.214 --> 18:38.618
- What are you
talking about?
- Oh.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.487
Lauren didn't tell you.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.405
[grunting]

18:58.438 --> 19:01.341
- Damn it!
- What are you doing here
this late?

19:01.374 --> 19:04.477
I have to train harder
if I'm going to petition
onto the National Team.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.580
- Wh... When?
- As soon as possible.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.616
If I'm not on the National Team
I can't go to Worlds,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.384
which are in just a few months.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.586
And no one's ever
won the Olympics
without going to Worlds.

19:13.620 --> 19:17.324
- Payson, you're not ready.
- What are you saying?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.759
I competed against China.
I'm back. Of course I'm ready.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.631
Come with me. I want
to show you something.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.340
- You're weighing me?
- I'm measuring you.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.276
- Why?
- Just step on, please.

19:42.282 --> 19:46.419
OK... now read that for me.

19:46.453 --> 19:49.222
Five-four. That's not right.
I'm five-three.

19:49.256 --> 19:52.492
You used to be five-three.
After your injury, all that
time you weren't training,

19:52.525 --> 19:56.629
- you had a growth spurt.
- That's...
That's impossible.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.965
You lost muscle mass
and gained normal body fat

19:58.998 --> 20:02.001
which triggered puberty.
You know this can happen in
a gymnast when they're out.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.503
And you were out
for a long time.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.372
But I'm back training again.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.774
- You can't make yourself
shorter.
- I can't be growing!

20:07.807 --> 20:10.477
I'll lose some of my skills.
This can't be happening!

20:10.510 --> 20:12.512
We can deal with this.
You need to be patient

20:12.545 --> 20:13.780
and accept that
your body is changing.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.448
You're going to have
to make some adjustments.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.784
This is exactly why it's too
soon for you to even think

20:17.817 --> 20:19.419
about petitioning
on the National Team.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.789
No! I'm the same
as I was before. Better.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.492
No, Payson, you're not.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.495
You're wrong.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.263
I'll show you.
You're wrong!

20:35.735 --> 20:37.404
[sighing]

20:49.482 --> 20:52.419
* Perfection has a price

20:52.452 --> 20:56.356
* But I cannot afford
to live that life... *

20:56.389 --> 20:58.458
Let me see those hands.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.430
[wincing] Oh.

21:03.463 --> 21:07.467
I thought so. You lost
some of your calluses
when you weren't training.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.637
Sasha called you, didn't he?

21:10.670 --> 21:13.373
Growing taller is nothing
to be ashamed of.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.442
I'm not a fashion model,
I'm an elite gymnast

21:15.475 --> 21:18.311
and height
is a serious handicap.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.846
There isn't a Chinese gymnast
over five feet tall

21:19.879 --> 21:21.614
and at five-three I was
already at a disadvantage.

21:21.648 --> 21:25.452
Well, you can't fight
Mother Nature. And...

21:25.485 --> 21:29.589
...in case you haven't noticed,
your breasts have grown, too.

21:29.622 --> 21:33.460
What? You're becoming a woman.
It's an amazing thing.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.728
I don't want you to hate that,
I want you to love that.

21:35.762 --> 21:38.331
I want you
to embrace that.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.367
If I train harder,
I can shut it down.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.070
Oh... Training harder
so that you can stop your body

21:44.103 --> 21:45.738
from developing,
well, that's not healthy.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.341
Neither are these bruises
and blisters or the fact

21:48.375 --> 21:51.811
that I broke my back
but it's just a reality
of the sport.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.881
Maybe it's time
that changed.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.315
You're 16 years old.

21:56.349 --> 22:00.453
You shouldn't have to have
the body of a nine-year-old
to be competitive.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.390
Then why did you let me
have that surgery?

22:03.423 --> 22:06.426
And train since
I was four years old
to go the Olympics?

22:06.459 --> 22:08.495
You know what it takes
to win just as much as I do.

22:08.528 --> 22:12.732
Are you saying I should quit
just to fill out a bigger bra?

22:12.765 --> 22:15.668
I am so close.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.505
The Olympics is less
than two years away,

22:18.538 --> 22:20.507
I have the rest of my life
to be a woman

22:20.540 --> 22:22.542
but right now all I want
to do is be is a gymnast.

22:24.477 --> 22:28.515
Mom, I need you to believe
that I'm coming back,

22:28.548 --> 22:30.917
and that I'm going
all the way.

22:30.950 --> 22:35.555
You... You do
believe that, don't you?

22:35.888 --> 22:37.557
Of course I do.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.960
- [chuckling]
- OK.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.570
I should get back
to my place.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.739
I don't know why you don't
just move back in here.

22:52.772 --> 22:56.509
It's got to be awful
living with four guys
in a one bedroom apartment.

22:56.543 --> 23:00.480
- It's not awful, just smelly.
- Ew.

23:01.514 --> 23:04.684
And you know
why I can't live here.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.487
It's inappropriate
now that we're, what, dating?

23:07.520 --> 23:11.424
Hanging out? Hooking up?

23:11.458 --> 23:13.560
Do we have to label it?

23:16.563 --> 23:18.831
Are you really over Kaylie?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.471
- I picked you, didn't I?
- Why did you pick me?

23:24.504 --> 23:27.974
Was it because you thought
Kaylie didn't want you?

23:28.007 --> 23:31.511
I picked you because...

23:31.544 --> 23:34.213
...because you were
there for me
when I needed someone.

23:34.246 --> 23:38.985
You took care of me
and no one's done that
since my mother died.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.921
Is that the only reason?

23:41.954 --> 23:43.790
Because I brought you food
and did your laundry?

23:43.823 --> 23:48.961
No. I also think
you're funny and sexy.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.498
- And gorgeous.
- And conceited.

23:51.531 --> 23:55.902
- Hey.
- And gorgeous and sweet
when you want to be.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.971
- I'm always sweet.
- No, you're not.

23:59.005 --> 24:03.009
- You're competitive.
- If I wasn't, I wouldn't be
a very good gymnast.

24:03.042 --> 24:06.613
Except you're more
competitive off the mats
than you are on them.

24:06.646 --> 24:10.583
It's like you're afraid if
someone else gets something,

24:10.617 --> 24:12.251
there won't be
anything left for you.

24:12.284 --> 24:17.023
Maybe I'm more competitive
because I don't get
everything the easy way.

24:17.056 --> 24:20.627
- Like Kaylie.
- There's one thing
you have she doesn't.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.595
What?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.535
Me.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.539
Do I? Really have you?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.641
[sighing]

24:34.674 --> 24:37.810
- Yes.
- All right, then.

24:37.844 --> 24:38.911
I pick you, too.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.916
We'll tell Kaylie.
But after the meet in France.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.253
I can't travel all that way
with her hating me.

24:47.286 --> 24:50.990
All right.
I want to tell her myself.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.959
She needs to hear it
from me, OK?

24:53.993 --> 24:56.563
- OK.
- OK.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.569
[both giggling]

25:19.018 --> 25:21.621
Did you see that?
It wasn't perfect,
but it will be.

25:21.654 --> 25:22.955
Then I'll start working
on my Yurchenko.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.725
A perfectly executed
Tsuk Arabian is worth more

25:25.758 --> 25:27.627
than a sloppy Yurchenko
one and a half.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.829
But a perfect 'Chenko
one and a half is worth more

25:29.862 --> 25:31.831
than a perfect Tsuk Arabian.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.634
I'm getting my skills back.
You'll see.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.037
Belov!

25:41.340 --> 25:42.541
Excuse me.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.614
Another five minutes,
then get to work, OK?

25:48.681 --> 25:50.349
What's that all about?

25:50.382 --> 25:53.019
My dad found out
about the suspension.

25:53.052 --> 25:57.590
- Didn't you tell him?
- I was going to, but your
mother beat me to it.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.593
As she was sucking down
another $200 dinner,
no doubt.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.862
- He looks mad.
- He thinks this is
all about Sasha's ego

26:02.895 --> 26:04.997
and not about what's
in our best interest.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.133
- What does your dad think?
- I haven't told him.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.902
He's out of town
but I'm pretty sure
he'd go ballistic.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.639
Well, both of our dads
have spent a lot of time
in this sport.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.742
Mine thinks Sasha is wrong.
And I think yours would, too.

26:15.775 --> 26:20.647
- All that matters
is what we think.
- And what do we think?

26:21.781 --> 26:24.150
- Could Sasha be wrong?
- He isn't always right.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.619
[Kaylie] I thought
you were the one
who said to trust him.

26:26.653 --> 26:27.620
It's not a matter of trust.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.723
Sasha means well but
nobody's right all the time.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.925
And if he is wrong,
you could be iced out
of the team permanently.

26:32.959 --> 26:36.896
And that would make it
a lot easier for you to get
petitioned on, wouldn't it?

26:36.929 --> 26:39.666
Look, Sasha's definitely
right about one thing.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.167
We have to stand together.

26:41.200 --> 26:46.739
The meet isn't until next week,
so there's still time
to play this out.

26:46.773 --> 26:50.009
The important thing is
that we don't panic.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.610
[doorbell ringing]

26:53.212 --> 26:54.546
- What's that?
- It's a tweet from Kelly Parker

26:54.580 --> 26:58.084
informing us there was
a National Team practice
today without us.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.153
Oh, my God.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.655
We're really off the team.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.223
It might be time to panic.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.266
I thought we weren't
gonna panic?

27:14.300 --> 27:17.436
All the National Team had
practice today in Denver.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.072
- Without us.
- Still think
they're bluffing?

27:20.106 --> 27:22.675
It seems like they picked
the girls who were going
to France today.

27:22.709 --> 27:26.112
- And they're not us.
- Well, is it too late
to do something?

27:26.145 --> 27:28.981
- Like what?
- Like go to Beals
and say we're sorry?

27:30.249 --> 27:32.218
I have to go to France.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.821
When I got hurt against China,
some people might have
gotten the idea

27:34.854 --> 27:37.223
that I was third around here.
I'm not.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.159
- Would we tell Sasha?
- He'd just try
to talk us out of it.

27:40.192 --> 27:44.096
- He doesn't have to know.
- Isn't that like throwing him
under the bus?

27:44.130 --> 27:46.232
It has nothing to do with Sasha.
These are our careers

27:46.265 --> 27:49.435
and if the goal is not
to be under anyone's thumb,

27:49.468 --> 27:51.137
then doesn't that
include our coach?

27:53.505 --> 27:55.241
What if he finds out?
Won't he be mad?

27:55.274 --> 27:58.911
We're just doing
what he told us to do.
Controlling our own fate.

27:58.945 --> 28:02.481
Let's face it, to get on
the Olympic Team, you have
to be on the National Team.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.818
And even then,
they still only pick six girls.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.721
You think it's gonna be
the six girls
who follow the rules,

28:08.755 --> 28:13.492
or the rebellious girls
that they're not sure
they can count on?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.962
I guess.

28:15.995 --> 28:19.031
At the end of the day,
it's about whether we make
the Olympic Team.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.233
And that road doesn't
go through Sasha.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.836
It goes through Ellen Beals.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.272
I say it's time we kissed
the asses that matter.

28:26.305 --> 28:30.209
And hopefully
Sasha never finds out.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.979
- Let's vote.
- OK, but...

28:33.012 --> 28:35.214
...we need to stick together,
so this has to be unanimous.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.918
All in favor of going
to Ellen Beals?

28:48.895 --> 28:51.197
Does Sasha know you're here?

28:51.230 --> 28:55.201
No. Um, we love Sasha
but we realize

28:55.234 --> 28:59.772
he may have led us astray
when he forced us to compete
against China at The Rock.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.440
He didn't force us.

29:01.473 --> 29:05.177
I think what we're trying to
say is The Rock girls do respect
the National Committee

29:05.211 --> 29:09.015
and we didn't mean to violate
any rules and we won't
let it happen again.

29:09.048 --> 29:12.251
I'm glad to hear that, Payson.
Unfortunately, you're not
on the National Team

29:12.284 --> 29:14.253
so you didn't violate
any rules.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.956
But I would like to hear
from the girls who did.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.327
What exactly
do you want to hear?

29:21.360 --> 29:25.131
That your loyalty is
to the National Gymnastics
Organization of America.

29:25.164 --> 29:28.200
Because after all,
you are competing
for your country.

29:28.234 --> 29:31.170
And that is
an honor and a pledge
I take very seriously.

29:31.203 --> 29:35.007
So, what I'm asking,
going forward, is who do you
pledge your allegiance to?

29:35.041 --> 29:37.343
Your club coach
or your National Team?

29:37.376 --> 29:40.813
I pledge my allegiance to
my country and the National
Gymnastics Organization.

29:40.847 --> 29:45.051
[Ellen] The National Committee
will be very pleased
to hear that, Lauren.

29:47.086 --> 29:50.857
- I do, too.
- I would like
to hear you say it.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.859
[sighing]

29:56.896 --> 30:02.068
I pledge my allegiance
to the National Gymnastics
Organization.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.403
And Emily?

30:07.406 --> 30:11.210
I pledge my allegiance
to the National Gymnastics
Organization.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.080
It makes me very happy
to see you girls this way.

30:14.113 --> 30:17.016
You know,
you girls can trust me.

30:17.049 --> 30:20.286
I was an elite gymnast,
too, back in the day.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.055
My goal was also to go
to the Olympics

30:23.089 --> 30:27.626
but even though I followed all
the rules and worked harder
than any other girl I knew,

30:27.659 --> 30:30.362
I still didn't make
the Olympic Team.

30:30.396 --> 30:33.933
It was the biggest
disappointment of my life.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.610
But, the consolation
is now I'm in the position

30:44.643 --> 30:48.147
to make other girls'
dreams come true.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.017
No one loves this sport
more than I do.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.052
Look at me.
I'm getting teary-eyed.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.621
[sighing] I'm just so
relieved to see you girls

30:55.654 --> 30:57.423
taking charge and
making the right move.

30:57.456 --> 31:01.928
- So, are we still suspended?
- And what about France?

31:01.961 --> 31:04.296
It's a really big meet.
We want to be there.

31:06.265 --> 31:09.235
I will plead your case
to my colleagues
and see what I can do.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.303
Miss Beals, when you
speak to the committee,

31:11.337 --> 31:14.073
can you talk to them
about my scholarship?

31:14.106 --> 31:17.009
I'm sorry, Emily,
you broke the rules
by having a job,

31:17.043 --> 31:19.111
and now,
it's beyond my control.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.347
Well, girls,
I'll be in touch.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.957
- May I have a word with you?
- Of course.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.294
I would like to be petitioned
onto the National Team.

31:35.327 --> 31:39.331
You've only been back
training for a few weeks.
Do you think you're ready?

31:39.365 --> 31:42.134
- You only get one chance.
- I'm ready.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.270
And Sasha?
What does he think?

31:44.303 --> 31:47.139
I know my own body and
I know what I'm capable of.

31:47.173 --> 31:50.376
I see. Well, I'll certainly
bring it up with the committee.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.478
Thank you.
You won't regret it.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.180
I am back
and better than ever.

32:05.191 --> 32:07.226
Why do I feel sick
to my stomach?

32:07.259 --> 32:09.261
For the same reason I do.

32:09.295 --> 32:13.099
Every time I see Sasha,
I feel like we betrayed him.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.433
What if he was right?

32:14.466 --> 32:17.703
What if Ellen Beals
was just trying to get us
to cave and we did?

32:17.736 --> 32:20.339
I really liked the idea
of having control
of our own fate.

32:20.372 --> 32:24.410
Which is what we did by going
to Beals and taking care
of it ourselves.

32:26.145 --> 32:31.117
I just hope if and when
he finds out
he doesn't hate us.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.292
- Here to chew me out some more?
- I'm here to keep
an eye on you.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.394
Something I should have been
doing all along.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.131
You brought me here
to take the girls and gym
to the next level.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.266
- I've done that.
- But at what cost?

32:47.299 --> 32:50.436
- I don't trust you anymore.
- The girls trust me and
that's all that matters.

32:53.039 --> 32:56.508
Hey. You've all been distracted
today and I know why.

33:00.446 --> 33:05.384
You heard about the National
Team practice yesterday in
Denver and you're nervous.

33:05.417 --> 33:09.355
Don't be. It was
a desperate move to get you
to cave, but you didn't.

33:09.388 --> 33:13.592
And I am so sure
they're taking you all
to France that, Emily...

33:14.593 --> 33:16.495
...I expedited your passport.

33:16.528 --> 33:20.432
Oh, my gosh. I've never
had a passport before.

33:20.466 --> 33:24.170
Well, pretty soon it's going
to be filled with visa stamps
from all over the world.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.805
I'm so proud of you,
girls.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.142
We've stood together
and we've stood strong
and I promise you,

33:30.176 --> 33:32.544
your trust in me
is going to pay off.

33:35.481 --> 33:36.615
Maybe right now, in fact.

33:38.384 --> 33:41.287
- Miss Beals, back so soon?
- Sooner than I thought.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.455
I have good news.
The committee has lifted
the girls' suspension.

33:43.489 --> 33:46.592
And I'm here to announce
the rankings for the upcoming
tournament in France.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.795
I am happy to announce,
for the first time,

33:49.828 --> 33:52.431
that Kaylie Cruz
will be ranked number one,

33:52.464 --> 33:55.301
and will be going to France
as the team captain.

33:55.334 --> 34:00.839
Beth Atchinson is second,
and Emily Kmetko is officially
ranked number three.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.443
- I'm ranked third?
- [Kaylie] What about
Kelly Parker?

34:04.476 --> 34:08.614
Kelly unfortunately suffered
a wrist sprain today and
won't be going to France.

34:08.647 --> 34:12.484
- What about me?
- You didn't make the top six
this time, Lauren.

34:12.518 --> 34:16.388
- I'm sorry.
- I got a bronze medal against
the Chinese here at The Rock.

34:16.422 --> 34:17.656
But you choked
against them in China.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.259
This is ridiculous!

34:20.292 --> 34:23.362
Nobody else had the guts
to come to you to apologize

34:23.395 --> 34:25.097
until I talked them into it!

34:25.131 --> 34:27.299
I'm the reason we came
to see you this morning

34:27.333 --> 34:31.370
and I'm the reason we all
pledged our allegiance
to you and the NGO. Me.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.842
We appreciate
your loyalty, Lauren,

34:36.875 --> 34:39.111
but there will be
other meets.

34:39.145 --> 34:41.380
Someone will call you today
to make travel arrangements.

34:41.413 --> 34:45.251
Oh, and Payson, we've agreed
to consider your petition.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.120
You'll be coming to France
to perform for the committee
as a whole.

34:52.558 --> 34:55.561
I think that's everything.
See you girls in France.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.368
Sasha...

35:04.470 --> 35:05.871
...we're so sorry.

35:05.904 --> 35:09.175
No, um... there's nothing
to be sorry about.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.677
You're all going to France
and that was
the whole point, right?

35:13.412 --> 35:15.414
Look, um,
if you're gonna win,

35:15.447 --> 35:17.115
you should get back
to training.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.390
So, I guess they don't
trust you as much as
you thought they did.

35:28.594 --> 35:31.363
- I want to go to France.
- What can I do about it?

35:31.397 --> 35:35.467
I don't know.
But I am not staying home,
so figure it out!

35:38.470 --> 35:39.471
Great.

35:53.585 --> 35:54.620
Payson.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.456
Look, um...

35:59.391 --> 36:01.660
I know you don't want
to hear this right now,

36:01.693 --> 36:04.496
but you'll only get
one shot to petition
onto the National Team,

36:04.530 --> 36:09.201
- and you're not ready.
- I've got two weeks,
I'll be ready.

36:19.545 --> 36:23.349
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.750
Your feelings aren't
just a little hurt?

36:27.786 --> 36:30.222
My feelings are irrelevant.

36:30.256 --> 36:33.392
I encouraged the girls to
take their fate into their
own hands and they did.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.262
Unfortunately, they then
put it in the hands
of the wrong person.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.997
Do you really think Ellen Beals
wants to hurt the girls?

36:39.030 --> 36:41.767
I think she wants
to control them.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.337
She doesn't care about
their ambitions unless
they further her own.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.773
And if the girls fail to do
that, then she'll use her power
on the National Committee

36:47.806 --> 36:51.243
to kill their dreams
by keeping them off
the Olympic Team.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.379
- But that's not fair.
- Well, that's the sport.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.682
But I can't change that.
Only the girls can.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.749
And they almost did.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.594
How do you think
Sasha's really feeling?

37:08.627 --> 37:10.529
He's got to be hurt.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.799
But he did say the whole point
was to go to France.

37:13.832 --> 37:17.536
Hello? Doesn't anyone
care that I'm totally
getting screwed here?

37:17.569 --> 37:20.772
We're sorry, Lo,
but you got to go to China
and we didn't.

37:20.806 --> 37:24.410
Oh, so tit for tat...
Is that how it works?

37:24.443 --> 37:26.545
I can't believe this.
I have to go to France.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.415
- [man] I'm looking
for Kaylie Cruz.
- That's me.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.483
I'm from Gymnastics Now
magazine.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.486
- We need your photo
approval for the cover shot.
- I'll take that.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.422
We all get
photo approval.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.295
What's this?

37:43.329 --> 37:45.764
We're all supposed
to be on the cover.

37:51.437 --> 37:52.471
Lauren! Wait!

37:54.606 --> 37:58.410
Look, I'm sorry! I didn't
know it was just gonna be
me on the cover.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.446
Of course you didn't,
because the universe
just opens up

38:00.479 --> 38:02.581
and gives Kaylie Cruz
whatever her heart desires!

38:02.614 --> 38:06.552
- That's not true.
- You're right! There's
something you didn't get.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.721
You didn't get Carter.
I did.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.724
And the night you called,
he didn't answer
because he was with me.

38:12.758 --> 38:16.328
Sleeping with me.
He picked me.

38:16.362 --> 38:18.530
Someone finally picked me!

38:18.564 --> 38:20.766
[engine starting]

38:30.442 --> 38:32.411
- [door opening]
- Oh! Hey, honey!

38:32.444 --> 38:36.081
I was just gonna grab
a quick bite to eat with Steve.

38:36.114 --> 38:39.685
- Is that OK?
- Two nights this week?
Is it getting serious?

38:39.718 --> 38:44.656
Oh, not really.
I just don't think
he likes to eat alone.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.792
- So, how was your day?
- Well...

38:48.560 --> 38:50.529
They lifted the suspension
and I'm going to France!

38:50.562 --> 38:53.899
What?! Oh, my gosh,
that's so exciting!

38:53.932 --> 38:57.469
Oh, my God!
Damon's in Europe.

38:57.503 --> 39:01.540
Do you know where he'll be?
Maybe you'll get to see him!

39:01.573 --> 39:03.742
I have no idea
where Damon is

39:03.775 --> 39:06.878
and I'm going
to France to compete.

39:06.912 --> 39:10.649
- And only to compete.
- OK.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.520
Although I'm going
to miss a week of work
at the Pizza Shack

39:14.553 --> 39:16.455
and we need that money
for the rent.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.690
Don't worry about it.
It'll get paid.

39:18.724 --> 39:21.527
Something will fall
in our laps. It always does.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.830
Just as long as
it doesn't fall out of
Steve Tanner's wallet.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.565
It won't.

39:26.598 --> 39:30.135
In fact, I told Steve
that we wanted his respect,
not his money,

39:30.168 --> 39:33.572
so you don't have
to worry about him or
anyone else owning us.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.409
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome.

39:46.452 --> 39:50.422
- Hi.
- Mr. Tanner, your date is
waiting. Right this way.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.431
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.533
We're just having drinks.

40:01.567 --> 40:05.637
Look, I have a date,
so let's cut to the chase.

40:05.671 --> 40:09.541
What do you want, Ellen,
and how do you want me
to help you get it?

40:09.575 --> 40:11.943
And here I thought
I was your date.

40:11.977 --> 40:15.447
- OK. I want Sasha Belov out.
- Of The Rock?

40:15.481 --> 40:17.449
Of the sport, but
I'll start with The Rock.

40:17.483 --> 40:20.586
Why? You got want you wanted.
The girls kissed your ring.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.588
They know where their
loyalties have to lie.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.723
Look, we have a chance
at engineering

40:24.756 --> 40:26.958
one of the best U.S.
Women's Olympic Teams
in history.

40:26.992 --> 40:29.194
But not with girls
thinking for themselves

40:29.227 --> 40:31.497
or being empowered
by some renegade coach.

40:31.530 --> 40:35.534
Obedience and respect
for authority are what
makes a great gymnast.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.603
And one bad apple
can spoil everything.

40:37.636 --> 40:40.872
So if I help you get rid
of Belov, what's in it
for me and my daughter?

40:40.906 --> 40:42.140
You get control
of The Rock again

40:42.173 --> 40:44.843
and Lauren gets her spot
on the National Team,
guaranteed.

40:44.876 --> 40:49.014
- She wants to go to France.
- Fine, we'll take her
as an alternate.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.250
There's one more thing
I want.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.521
Reinstate Emily Kmetko's
scholarship.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.524
No can do. Why do you
care about Emily Kmetko?

40:58.557 --> 41:00.992
To tell you the truth,
no one on the committee
is certain she's for real.

41:01.026 --> 41:05.497
Fine. But say someone
wanted to sponsor her,
anonymously,

41:05.531 --> 41:10.035
could you arrange for a
private sports endowment group
to fund a new scholarship?

41:10.068 --> 41:14.606
- I don't see why not.
- No one can ever know
it's me.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.943
I understand.
Do we have an alliance?

41:22.881 --> 41:24.916
And now,
if you'll excuse me...

41:24.950 --> 41:29.621
You have a date, yes, I know.
Give my best to Mrs. Kmetko.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.292
Just between us girls,

41:34.325 --> 41:37.729
you were gonna take them to
France anyway, weren't you?

41:54.112 --> 41:56.648
[ringing]

41:56.682 --> 41:59.618
- Hello?
- Emily, it's Ellen Beals.

41:59.651 --> 42:03.054
I felt so bad about you
losing your scholarship
that I pulled some strings

42:03.088 --> 42:05.691
and I've convinced a private
sports endowment group

42:05.724 --> 42:07.626
to sponsor you,
beginning right away.

42:07.659 --> 42:10.095
Oh, my gosh, that's great.

42:10.128 --> 42:12.097
And they're going
to cover all your expenses
so you won't have to work

42:12.130 --> 42:14.900
- at that pizza place anymore.
- Wow.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.802
I told you
you could trust me.

42:16.835 --> 42:20.906
- I hope this proves it.
- It does. Thank you.

42:20.939 --> 42:23.809
Just make sure you follow
the rules this time.

42:23.842 --> 42:25.977
I will. Thank you so much.

42:26.011 --> 42:29.648
You're welcome, Emily.
I'll see you in Calais.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.586

that it's frightening *

I know is worth fighting *

42:58.944 --> 43:04.049

43:46.091 --> 43:51.429
