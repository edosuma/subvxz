01:00.010 --> 01:03.600
His Eminence, Arnaldo,
Bishop of Paris.

01:05.510 --> 01:08.590
Eminence, everything is prepared.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.875
Take all the time you need.

01:27.900 --> 01:33.769
When you are satisfied,
We will gladly bind it for you.

01:33.890 --> 01:35.850
Thank you.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.120
<i>How could it had been otherwise</i>

01:44.440 --> 01:47.520
<i>that a woman had once occupied
the Papal Throne</i>

01:48.040 --> 01:50.930
<i>was a disgrace to the Church...</i>

01:50.960 --> 01:55.870
<i>Of course, Johanna was not mentioned
in the Chronicle of the Popes.</i>

01:56.150 --> 02:00.110
<i>But was there truly to be no trace
of her existence?</i>

02:00.190 --> 02:03.710
<i>Was she to be banished from
history altogether?</i>

02:03.810 --> 02:07.527
<i>A woman who had
accomplished so much?</i>

02:09.259 --> 02:14.606
<i>The first day of Johanna's life
was the last of Charlemagne's.</i>

02:14.675 --> 02:19.452
<i>They called him "the Great" but in
the eastern part of the Frankish Empire,</i>

02:19.515 --> 02:24.143
<i>in former Germania, people had
terrible memories of the emperor</i>

02:24.210 --> 02:29.878
<i>and his soldiers, who fought the heathen
faith for years with flame and sword.</i>

02:30.970 --> 02:34.138
<i>But now, people
have enough difficulty</i>

02:34.185 --> 02:36.190
<i>just surviving the winter.</i>

03:05.500 --> 03:09.570
- What are you doing, woman?
- This will ease her pain.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.043
The word of our Lord:

03:15.250 --> 03:18.364
"In sorrow shall thou bring forth children."

03:18.675 --> 03:21.600
Then I need your help.
We don't have much time.

03:21.715 --> 03:22.955
That's women's work,

03:23.080 --> 03:26.946
- lowly and unclean.
- Then your wife will die.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.740
That rests in God's hand, not mine.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.086
It will be difficult raising two boys
without their mother.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.532
What do you want me to do?

03:41.550 --> 03:44.950
Sit behind her...
support her back.

03:54.980 --> 03:57.620
Now take this cloth.

04:01.090 --> 04:04.010
Pull to one side!

04:06.570 --> 04:09.210
Push! Oh my goodness.

04:14.920 --> 04:19.000
It's a girl. Healthy and strong,
by the look of her.

04:28.110 --> 04:31.830
A girl!

04:34.430 --> 04:38.420
She will be named Johanna.

04:53.685 --> 04:56.685
Five years later

05:06.400 --> 05:11.824
<i>Johanna was a gifted child,
and she had a clear mind.</i>

05:11.880 --> 05:14.950
<i>Her hunger for knowledge
was insatiable.</i>

05:15.990 --> 05:21.149
<i>In spite of her youth, she had an
innate wisdom way beyond her years.</i>

05:22.470 --> 05:26.231
- Do you know its name?
- Marigold.

05:26.270 --> 05:27.408
And what does it do?

05:27.420 --> 05:31.420
Helps us when we have a stomachache
or when we cut ourselves.

05:31.460 --> 05:35.260
Very good, little quail.
You learn quickly.

05:35.860 --> 05:39.970
So father will teach me too?

05:44.090 --> 05:46.450
We should get dinner ready.
Right away!

05:49.190 --> 05:53.680
No. "Beneficium." Do you know
the difference is not between a "b" and a "d"?

05:55.760 --> 05:59.283
Keep trying Johannes.
Father will be back soon.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.240
I cannot do it.

06:05.910 --> 06:08.990
- What does it say?
- The psalm "Confitebor."

06:10.030 --> 06:14.830
<i>Confitebor tibi Domine
in toto corde meo</i>

06:15.430 --> 06:19.100
<i>mirabo omnia mirabilia tua.</i>

06:20.180 --> 06:22.220
- Where did you...
- I've been listening.

06:22.740 --> 06:26.980
I want to read Psalms too... and write.
Will you teach me?

06:27.500 --> 06:29.548
I cannot do that, little sister.

06:29.570 --> 06:33.010
- Why not?
- Father would never allow it.

06:33.490 --> 06:36.170
Why not?

06:37.090 --> 06:41.514
Because it is forbidden for girls.
It would be blasphemy.

06:41.560 --> 06:46.073
And because girls cannot learn to
read and write, just like mother.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.800
And just like you.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.120
Please Matthew.
I won't tell.

06:57.830 --> 07:01.512
You are a wonder, little sister.

07:01.550 --> 07:04.083
And you know what you just wrote?

07:04.110 --> 07:10.079
Lord, thy grace reaches as far as the heaven,
and my truth as far as the cloud.

07:10.140 --> 07:13.465
St. Catherine would be
very proud of you.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.291
Who is that?

07:14.300 --> 07:18.140
She lived centuries ago in Alexandria.
Even though she was a woman,

07:18.180 --> 07:21.290
and still quite young,
she was learned and wise.

07:22.010 --> 07:22.930
Tell me more about her!

07:26.490 --> 07:28.429
Catherine was a king's daughter.

07:28.450 --> 07:31.450
Among the pagan Romans,
she dared to become a Christian.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.160
How far you know, Johannes?

07:35.680 --> 07:38.451
Why the heathen chose to
not convert to Christianity?

07:38.480 --> 07:41.211
They must, or they'll all be killed!

07:41.240 --> 07:45.506
Only you should give them the time
to make up their mind.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.371
Where were we?

07:47.390 --> 07:49.369
- Sword?
- Rumpia.

07:49.390 --> 07:50.775
- Heart?
- Cor.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.510
- Knowledge?
- <i>Scientia</i>.

07:53.110 --> 07:57.100
- Holy Bush?
- Even you don't know!

07:58.700 --> 08:00.260
Ah... Help!

08:01.460 --> 08:06.859
Tell me that story again,
of our origin.

08:08.060 --> 08:13.249
Although he was already very wise,
Odin always sought more knowledge...

08:14.490 --> 08:17.730
So, he came
to the well of wisdom.

08:18.930 --> 08:23.920
But the giant Mimir, guardian
of the well, told Odin:

08:25.160 --> 08:29.720
"Wisdom is always born with pain..."

08:32.200 --> 08:34.870
Please don't stop.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.350
In return for a drink from the well,

08:38.390 --> 08:40.470
Mimir demanded one of Odin's eyes.

08:42.590 --> 08:46.618
Odin gave up one of his eyes,
drank from the well...

08:46.660 --> 08:50.896
and past his knowledge on
to mankind.

08:50.940 --> 08:54.020
To girls as well?

08:55.220 --> 08:58.229
If father will let me learn
to read and write,

08:58.260 --> 09:02.250
maybe Odin will
share his knowledge with me.

09:03.970 --> 09:05.170
How dare you?

09:07.170 --> 09:08.490
You are back already, husband?

09:08.730 --> 09:14.079
Under this roof! How dare you
pray to your pagan gods?

09:14.480 --> 09:17.093
The child was frightened. So I told her
a harmless story.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.720
Harmless?
You call such blasphemy "harmless"?

09:22.640 --> 09:24.649
- Please don't, father!
- Get up and out of here!

09:24.670 --> 09:26.470
Go. Quick, you go.

09:28.990 --> 09:31.950
Heathen creature!

09:34.230 --> 09:37.180
You renounce Satan? Hmm?

09:39.340 --> 09:44.091
- In words! Say the words!
- I renounce Satan.

09:44.140 --> 09:47.860
And his evil and all the
temptations of evil!

09:49.650 --> 09:52.330
No. No. No!

10:00.690 --> 10:04.400
You say the words again!

10:06.560 --> 10:11.560
- To the outside, quick!
- You say the words!

10:25.110 --> 10:28.742
Why? Why?

10:28.780 --> 10:31.220
Father forbade mother to worship
a heathen god,

10:32.220 --> 10:36.298
and in the Bible, it says woman
must obey her husband.

10:36.340 --> 10:37.685
But in the Bible it also says:

10:37.700 --> 10:41.090
"Love is patient. Love is kind.
Love knows no anger."

10:41.570 --> 10:42.757
I have read it myself.

10:42.770 --> 10:46.010
And if father ever finds out
you would be next.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.560
Keep praying, my son,
for God will heal you.

10:57.080 --> 11:00.800
Think of the honor that
will soon be yours...

11:01.480 --> 11:04.830
Going to a cathedral school.

11:06.230 --> 11:10.743
God intends for you to be
a scholar and a priest.

11:10.790 --> 11:13.990
You must be strong for Him.

11:34.890 --> 11:38.968
You have to get well again.
Who else is going to teach me?

11:39.010 --> 11:43.880
There is not much more
I can teach you, little sister.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.200
I have something for you.

11:50.480 --> 11:55.310
- Turn it around.
- "Saint Catherine of Alexandria".

11:55.910 --> 11:58.998
You are sisters in spirit.

11:59.030 --> 12:03.150
She will guide you,
like a sister.

13:11.970 --> 13:16.130
Tell me child, do you know where
the priest's house is?

13:17.810 --> 13:21.840
- Yes, Sir.
- And who are you, industrious girl?

13:22.200 --> 13:23.743
I'm his daughter, Johanna.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.720
God be with you, Johanna,
my name is Aesculapius.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.288
I would very much like to
speak with your father.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.497
You are coming here to shame me Sir.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.670
You are the school master,
I should have served you well.

13:36.470 --> 13:41.589
I thank you, Sir. And your wife,
and your children.

13:42.430 --> 13:46.072
The Bishop has told me
of your misfortune,

13:46.110 --> 13:49.901
and that you'd now like to send your
second son to the cathedral school.

13:49.940 --> 13:55.443
Johannes is a worthy replacement
for his brother. He's a smart boy.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.300
Eager to learn.

13:56.820 --> 14:00.850
To meet such children makes the
long journey worthwhile.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.530
Though, I was disappointed not to
find any works by Plato.

14:06.730 --> 14:07.330
Plato?

14:08.010 --> 14:11.800
His works are hardly approved
for study for a Christian.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.878
So you don't find any significance
in his works?

14:15.920 --> 14:20.315
Faith is grounded on the
authority of the Holy Scripture,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.775
not on the writings of philosophers.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.512
But you have to admit
our ability to think rationally

14:26.550 --> 14:28.093
is... God-given.

14:28.110 --> 14:29.970
From Him alone.

14:29.990 --> 14:34.147
Then why are you fear to expose faith
to the light of reason?

14:34.190 --> 14:38.535
Since God Himself gave us reason,
how could it lead us from Him?

14:38.580 --> 14:41.391
Does fear of logic show a lack of faith

14:41.420 --> 14:44.860
in God's omniscience
and his love for mankind?

14:45.340 --> 14:47.980
A solid faith need have no fear,

14:48.380 --> 14:52.923
because if God exists, logic can
only take us to Him.

14:52.970 --> 14:56.050
<i>Cogito, ergo Deus est.</i>

14:56.130 --> 15:00.410
I think, therefore God exists!

15:01.370 --> 15:05.200
Johanna felt the truth in
Aesculapius's words.

15:05.240 --> 15:10.479
"I think, therefore God exists."
And she knew her father was wrong.

15:10.760 --> 15:14.870
Her love of knowledge was
neither sinful nor unnatural.

15:15.270 --> 15:18.070
It was God's gift
to mankind.

15:18.950 --> 15:22.711
Johanna had blamed herself
for Matthew's death.

15:22.750 --> 15:26.699
Now she knew her desire to learn
had not cost him his life.

15:26.740 --> 15:31.412
Matthew died because no one
knew how to help him.

15:31.460 --> 15:36.013
She understood then and there
that it was her duty

15:36.060 --> 15:41.249
to expand her knowledge and to put
her abilities to work for the greater good.

15:42.810 --> 15:47.010
<i>Sí... Simile est grano...</i>

15:47.810 --> 15:52.680
<i>quod acceptum...</i>

15:53.880 --> 15:57.800
The boy is confused.
Believe me, he can do better.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.440
<i>Hortum...</i>

15:59.840 --> 16:04.790
<i>et crevits et...</i>

16:07.990 --> 16:10.950
You are a disgrace!

16:14.070 --> 16:16.740
Let him go.

16:20.340 --> 16:24.540
God did not intend every child
to study Scripture.

16:27.940 --> 16:33.169
<i>Simile est quod acceptum grano sinapis
Gay misit in hortum suum...</i>

16:34.170 --> 16:38.730
<i>et crevit et factum est
in arborem magnam...</i>

16:39.090 --> 16:43.440
<i>et volucres caeli
requieverunt in ramis eius...</i>

16:44.160 --> 16:47.840
- You know how to read?
- And write.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.775
- Matthew taught me.
- How dare you.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.480
I can take Matthew's place
at the schola and study.

16:55.350 --> 16:59.665
- I can make you proud, father.
- Unnatural creature!

16:59.710 --> 17:04.144
You have brought God's wrath
down upon us.

17:04.190 --> 17:08.339
Did you understand
what you just read?

17:08.780 --> 17:13.729
"It's similar to a mustard seed,
that a man took and planted in his garden."

17:13.780 --> 17:15.997
"And it grew and became a tree,"

17:16.020 --> 17:20.207
"and the birds at the sky
lived in its branches."

17:20.250 --> 17:25.050
And what you think
it's meant by the mustard seed?

17:25.890 --> 17:27.433
Perhaps its faith,

17:27.450 --> 17:30.538
planted in the heart
like a mustard seed in the garden.

17:30.570 --> 17:34.680
And if you tend to it,
a big tree will grow from it.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.200
But perhaps it also means the Church.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.680
It too started like a mustard seed,
small and in the dark.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.670
But thanks to Jesus and the Apostles,
it grew and grew.

17:45.270 --> 17:48.991
She must has persuaded her brother
to teach her behind my back.

17:49.030 --> 17:51.880
I will punish her accordingly.

17:51.910 --> 17:55.470
And the birds that nest
in the branches?

17:56.740 --> 18:00.778
They are the faithful who find
salvation in the Church.

18:00.820 --> 18:03.631
And the mustard seed could also
represent Jesus Christ,

18:03.660 --> 18:05.797
for he was like a seed
when he was buried

18:05.820 --> 18:11.329
and like a tree when he was
resurrected and rose toward heaven.

18:12.010 --> 18:13.450
Thank you.

18:19.130 --> 18:21.267
You heard that?

18:21.290 --> 18:26.280
The mustard seed is the symbol
of faith of the Church and the Christ.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.128
A classical scriptural exegesis.

18:30.160 --> 18:34.703
Your daughter displayed an
extraordinarily sharp mind.

18:34.750 --> 18:40.109
- I will teach her.
- The girl? You are not serious?

18:40.230 --> 18:45.179
I am. Of course they will never
approve her in Rome and the Schola.

18:45.230 --> 18:48.300
I will come and teach her here
as far as I can.

18:48.820 --> 18:49.780
And what about the boy?

18:51.500 --> 18:55.620
Forgive me, but the Schola
is not for your son.

18:55.980 --> 19:00.523
He is to be passed over while a mere girl
gets to study the Holy Scripture?

19:00.570 --> 19:02.945
Out of the question!

19:02.970 --> 19:08.209
It would be a sacrilege to waste such
an alert mind.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.370
No!

19:11.210 --> 19:14.520
Either you teach both,
or neither.

19:21.520 --> 19:26.190
This is by Cicero, the greatest
orator Rome ever knew.

19:27.110 --> 19:30.792
- And they let you bring it?
- No.

19:30.830 --> 19:33.957
But why should I let the boys
at the cathedral school better off

19:33.990 --> 19:36.540
to enjoy their offerings of the library.

19:37.060 --> 19:40.029
The Academy in Athens
stood for a 1,000 years.

19:40.060 --> 19:43.148
Then Emperor Justinian forbade it.

19:43.180 --> 19:47.340
A great age of philosophers ended.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.739
So where could you
study their writings?

19:50.770 --> 19:53.170
How could all that knowledge
be preserved for so long?

19:53.690 --> 19:58.599
Well, in that same year Saint Benedict founded
his monastery in Montecassino.

19:58.650 --> 20:03.233
Soon, many others were built, and within
their protected walls the legacies of

20:03.280 --> 20:08.519
the wise, Greeks and Romans, could be
handed down through the centuries.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.920
The Earth is the center of the universe.

20:14.470 --> 20:19.509
We're encircled by a
crystal shelf, the sphere...

20:20.230 --> 20:23.310
to which the planets are attached.

20:23.830 --> 20:29.339
Pythagoras says they even
make music as they turn.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.350
I... have bad news.

20:36.380 --> 20:40.963
Another man has applied
for the position of schoolmaster,

20:41.010 --> 20:45.088
and the Bishop thinks he is
better suited than I.

20:45.130 --> 20:49.683
- No! That cannot be!
- I'll go to Byzantium,

20:49.730 --> 20:54.879
Now I will do whatever I can to make sure
your precious gift will not go unused.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.400
I have promised you.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.310
This is for you.

21:06.550 --> 21:08.608
It is Homer's "Odyssey,"

21:08.630 --> 21:11.870
The oldest writing work
known to mankind.

21:13.310 --> 21:16.279
I transcribed it myself.

21:16.310 --> 21:22.299
First, the Greek original,
followed by the Latin translation.

21:33.690 --> 21:38.450
- Where did you get this book?
- Aesculapius gave it to me.

21:44.960 --> 21:48.040
What kind of language is this?

21:50.040 --> 21:53.207
- How can you read this?
- It is Greek, father.

21:53.240 --> 21:56.270
I learned it from Aesculapius.

22:17.220 --> 22:20.971
You have insulted God
with your disobedience.

22:21.010 --> 22:25.246
As the punishment... you work day and night,
taking nothing but bread and water

22:25.290 --> 22:29.605
until every last word of
unchristian writing is off here.

22:29.650 --> 22:32.440
Begin! Begin!

22:33.480 --> 22:35.680
Begin!

22:39.280 --> 22:41.120
Harder!

22:47.430 --> 22:49.270
No.

22:56.030 --> 22:58.870
Then I will teach you to fear
the pains of Hell.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.513
No. She is your daughter!

23:01.540 --> 23:05.460
- Out of here! Both of you!
- Please Mama, come!

23:11.890 --> 23:14.850
Bare your back and kneel!

23:22.600 --> 23:27.360
- Say the Lord's prayer.
- Our father which art in heaven.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.337
Keep going!

23:31.360 --> 23:36.180
Keep going! Or did that heretic
teach you a different prayer?

23:36.230 --> 23:39.150
Hallowed be...

23:39.390 --> 23:42.190
thy name!

23:42.710 --> 23:46.350
Your Kingdom come.
Thy will be done...

23:47.500 --> 23:50.548
on earth as it is in heaven!

23:50.580 --> 23:53.860
Give us this day
our daily bread...

23:54.380 --> 23:59.529
and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

24:26.950 --> 24:29.998
- Are you the priest of this village?
- I am.

24:30.030 --> 24:32.088
I'm an envoy from The Bishop of Dorstadt.

24:32.110 --> 24:34.247
Dorstadt?

24:34.270 --> 24:37.620
Then you've been on the road for weeks.
Just to find me?

24:37.860 --> 24:40.540
Not entirely.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.320
Johannes.

25:10.160 --> 25:13.840
The Bishop is calling you
to the Schola.

25:14.470 --> 25:19.181
Forgive me, sir, but I'm here
to bring a girl to Dorstadt.

25:19.230 --> 25:23.270
- A girl named... Johanna.
- I'm Johanna! I'm to go to the schola!

25:23.390 --> 25:26.666
It's ridiculous! Johannes, Johanna...
A small mistake in the writing.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.300
- Happens even to the best of scribes!
- That may be...

25:29.380 --> 25:34.180
Use your head, what's a girl supposed
to do in the cathedral school?

25:37.340 --> 25:39.982
You are the mother.
What do you say?

25:40.010 --> 25:44.761
Disrespectful man, you dare doubt the
word of a devoted servant of the Lord?

25:44.810 --> 25:49.250
Calm yourself, pious father. Remember
the authority that I represent.

25:52.040 --> 25:55.167
You must have known about these plans.

25:55.200 --> 26:00.399
The Bishop does not just send for any child,
so which one am I supposed to take to Dorstadt?

26:11.390 --> 26:14.470
You ought to take the boy.

26:15.270 --> 26:17.020
Then...

26:18.700 --> 26:23.015
So should it be. Hurry!
A raft is waiting for us.

26:23.060 --> 26:25.831
Fast! Come, come.

26:25.860 --> 26:28.660
Pack your things!

26:39.610 --> 26:42.240
Johannes, it's time.

26:52.640 --> 26:56.910
Prove yourself worthy receiving
somewhat good. Go now.

27:08.140 --> 27:13.499
Give this letter to the Bishop.
Don't dare to open it yourself.

29:43.860 --> 29:46.500
Johannes!

29:48.460 --> 29:50.210
Johanna!

30:04.200 --> 30:08.320
For seven days the two of them
rode the Rhine downstream.

30:09.480 --> 30:13.875
Many of the rafts men were captivated
by Johanna's wisdom...

30:13.920 --> 30:15.590
and touched by her story.

30:17.230 --> 30:18.670
Johanna knew...

30:18.990 --> 30:22.989
God wanted to rescue her
from her miserable existence.

30:23.030 --> 30:27.296
Why else would He have allowed
her to find her brother?

30:27.340 --> 30:32.606
The Lord had reached out His hand to her
and she felt compelled to take it.

30:32.660 --> 30:35.180
This is from the Bishop.
We are expected at the Schola.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.520
Pardon me, Eminence.
The girl has arrived.

31:45.720 --> 31:46.511
Girl?

31:46.520 --> 31:51.073
- You had her fetched from Ingelheim.
- Oh, Yes, now I remember.

31:51.120 --> 31:56.376
That Greek scholar's idea.
But am I seeing double?

31:56.430 --> 31:57.696
The boy is her brother.

31:57.710 --> 32:02.670
Their father, a priest, insists that
he too be allowed to attend the schola.

32:02.950 --> 32:06.660
What do you know? I send for one.
I get two.

32:07.300 --> 32:13.739
If only the Emperor were as generous
as this holy man from the countryside.

32:17.620 --> 32:22.889
Well, are you really the little scholar
they described you as?

32:24.530 --> 32:26.786
I studied hard, Sir.

32:26.810 --> 32:29.810
It is said that you can
read and write Greek.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.200
Remarkable!

32:32.800 --> 32:35.920
Not even our highly regarded Odo
has mastered it.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.056
Right, Odo?

32:42.080 --> 32:46.425
You know very well that I cannot
condone this new whim of yours.

32:46.470 --> 32:50.706
It goes against God's will to
accept a woman at the cathedral school.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.610
It is also pointless.

32:52.630 --> 32:58.559
Women do not possess natural ability
to draw logical conclusions.

32:58.620 --> 33:02.698
The useful sections of the
female brain are so small.

33:02.740 --> 33:06.860
Women are incapable of understanding
higher ideas or concepts.

33:06.980 --> 33:10.850
St Paul himself has asserted this truth...

33:11.090 --> 33:15.290
that women are subservient to men,
as determined by the order of creation,

33:15.530 --> 33:19.130
hierarchy and strength... of will.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.680
Well, young scholar, have you
nothing to counter it?

33:28.200 --> 33:32.240
How can woman be second
to man in creation?

33:32.680 --> 33:34.790
She was made out
with Adam's rib.

33:35.310 --> 33:39.710
Adam, on the other hand,
was molded from common clay.

33:41.790 --> 33:42.470
Go on.

33:43.870 --> 33:45.470
As for strength of will...

33:45.950 --> 33:49.820
woman can be viewed
superior to man.

33:50.020 --> 33:54.850
Eve ate from the apple out of love
of knowledge and learning.

33:54.900 --> 33:59.130
Adam ate only because
Eve asked him to.

34:32.949 --> 34:37.967
The child is an inspiration!
Just what we need here in the Schola!

34:38.020 --> 34:41.500
Odo! You have two
new students.

34:43.540 --> 34:47.697
Have your reverend decided yet where
the child should be housed?

34:47.739 --> 34:52.610
Obviously she cannot live
in the boys' dormitory.

34:52.969 --> 34:54.650
The girl can live with me in my family.

34:54.969 --> 34:56.850
She'll be a good companion
for my two daughters.

34:57.210 --> 35:01.210
Excellent, Conde Gerold!
The girl will stay with you.

35:23.750 --> 35:26.820
Welcome to Villaris, Johanna.

35:28.020 --> 35:31.100
- Good evening, Sir.
- Good evening.

35:31.820 --> 35:36.888
- What does the meaning of this?
- Richilde! May I present you Johanna.

35:36.940 --> 35:40.370
Johanna, this is my wife, Richilde,
the Lady of the House.

35:40.890 --> 35:44.295
Johanna arrived today to begin
her study at the Schola.

35:44.330 --> 35:49.992
- A girl? A girl is to attend a cathedral school?
- At the request of the Bishop.

35:50.050 --> 35:54.237
- He is a disgrace to the Church.
- Johanna is going to live with us.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.240
With us?

35:56.480 --> 35:59.053
This country pumpkin?

35:59.080 --> 36:01.120
Richilde, you forget who yourself is.

36:01.280 --> 36:07.549
Johanna is a guest of this house.
And she should be treated as such.

36:11.950 --> 36:15.350
Have no fear.
You will be fine in here.

36:38.290 --> 36:40.784
What are you looking at?
Why are you not working?

36:40.810 --> 36:45.040
- Forgive me, I...
- Silence!

36:52.320 --> 36:55.110
Is there mistake... in the writing?

36:58.790 --> 37:01.470
Well... No.

37:02.030 --> 37:05.157
But still... your hand...

37:05.190 --> 37:08.220
It is not sure enough here... and here.

37:08.340 --> 37:12.418
What excuse do you have for...
for such lubberly work?

37:12.460 --> 37:14.980
I have no excuse, Sir.

37:16.820 --> 37:21.205
To atone for your carelessness and so
you may learn the meaning of humility,

37:21.250 --> 37:23.450
you will clean the floor tonight.

37:25.250 --> 37:28.853
During that time, you will contemplate
the writings of Saint Paul

37:28.890 --> 37:33.120
about the position of women.
Do you know them?

37:33.520 --> 37:38.999
"I suffer not a woman to teach, nor
to usurp authority over man"

37:39.320 --> 37:42.840
"but to be in silence."

37:43.440 --> 37:47.750
- You ought to remember it well.
- Yes, Schoolmaster.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.760
Girls!
Gisela, Johanna.

38:24.320 --> 38:28.720
Sensible with this women.
Go!

39:17.280 --> 39:20.360
Just open your eyes.
Can't you see it's there?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.040
But they are blind!

39:22.240 --> 39:25.310
If they kill the pig,
they get the meat.

39:33.350 --> 39:36.310
Psst!, young woman!

39:40.540 --> 39:45.859
Do you know what this is?
Milk of the Holy Virgin Mary!

39:50.290 --> 39:55.649
There are only five of these bottles.
This is the last.

39:56.010 --> 40:00.770
And since you're such a friendly girl.
I will give it to you...

40:01.440 --> 40:04.080
for only one denarius.

40:07.760 --> 40:11.798
- Are you mad? How dare you?
- Forgive me, Sir.

40:11.840 --> 40:16.066
But even the milk of the Virgin
will be spoilt after 800 years.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.470
That milk is holy! It cannot spoil!

40:18.550 --> 40:22.150
Perhaps not. But how did it stay warm
all these years?

40:22.350 --> 40:27.899
And how can you ask such a low price
for something so holy?

40:30.500 --> 40:33.620
- Are you laughing at me?
- No, not at all.

40:34.900 --> 40:38.900
I'm in all of you Johanna
with all my heart.

40:39.610 --> 40:41.810
Oh, look!

40:44.410 --> 40:47.490
Parchments!

40:53.000 --> 40:55.040
What is this?

40:55.360 --> 40:59.438
They are writings in Greek. But...
I don't understand the drawings.

40:59.480 --> 41:03.479
Probably some sort of construction plan.
Can you translate?

41:03.520 --> 41:07.350
It looks like a pulley, but not one
you more with your hands.

41:07.390 --> 41:09.870
Maybe we could build it...
together.

41:11.430 --> 41:13.488
I see you have an eye for a bargain.

41:13.510 --> 41:15.990
The paper might be old,
but it can still be put to use.

41:20.060 --> 41:23.020
Come! Come!

41:40.410 --> 41:43.840
It works! It works!

41:46.800 --> 41:51.720
Do you still think it was a sin
to accept Johanna to the Schola?

41:53.840 --> 41:58.949
You should take this girl as a model!
Her work is perfect.

42:41.850 --> 42:44.850
Seven years later

43:05.820 --> 43:06.700
What is troubling you?

43:06.980 --> 43:09.900
The Norsemen are pushing deeper
and deeper into our land.

43:09.930 --> 43:12.345
But surely we are safe here?

43:12.370 --> 43:14.507
They've even taken Paris.

43:14.530 --> 43:16.450
The Emperor is assembling troops.

43:16.650 --> 43:21.959
- You are going away... to war?
- Yes, in a few days.

43:23.320 --> 43:28.229
No more dark thought.
Come, want to show you something.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.000
What is it?

43:34.110 --> 43:37.190
Don't move.
Just Stay there.

43:42.190 --> 43:45.150
Now watch this.

43:51.780 --> 43:53.740
- The Greek apparatus.
- Yes.

43:54.060 --> 43:55.900
Only bigger!

43:58.380 --> 44:00.890
Look at this!

44:02.330 --> 44:03.690
Can you show it again?

44:03.810 --> 44:06.290
Well, we have to get more water
from the stream.

44:07.010 --> 44:09.730
Where are the buckets?

44:11.050 --> 44:14.160
I'm going to tell the Bishop
all about your skill.

44:14.680 --> 44:17.491
He will name you chief constructor of the city

44:17.520 --> 44:19.776
and free you from your duties to the Emperor.

44:19.800 --> 44:24.829
Then you will not have to go to war.
What do you say to that?

44:25.590 --> 44:31.749
What's wrong, wise Archimedes?
Suddenly so speechless?

45:30.740 --> 45:35.580
Forgive me. I should take you home
as long as I have the will power.

45:36.580 --> 45:39.770
Trust me, It's better this way.

45:47.330 --> 45:50.378
You've done well schoolmaster,
I thank you.

45:50.410 --> 45:55.547
As soon as my husband leaves to the North
I will deal with this annoying problem.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.609
I will not allow this little nobody
to embarrass me

45:58.640 --> 46:01.560
in front of the entire city.

46:02.560 --> 46:06.550
Your are aware that the Bishop holds
his protective hand over the girl?

46:06.950 --> 46:09.150
Not for long, Schoolmaster,
not for long.

47:07.620 --> 47:10.740
You would force the girl to marry
against her will?

47:11.260 --> 47:13.900
What does your husband say
about the matter?

47:14.500 --> 47:20.889
He does not know.
Gerold's feeling clouds his judgment.

47:21.690 --> 47:25.887
Once Johanna married, she will no longer
be allowed to attend the Schola.

47:25.930 --> 47:30.087
That is why I'm here to
ask your consent.

47:30.130 --> 47:32.760
I see.

47:34.760 --> 47:38.442
For many years, she has been
fed and clothed by my family.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.172
How long must we provide such charity?

47:41.200 --> 47:43.840
The blacksmith's son is a good match.

47:44.350 --> 47:47.430
He is blunt and illiterate.

47:48.110 --> 47:53.297
May I remind you that Johanna
was put in my custody.

47:53.350 --> 47:57.740
As the Lady of Villaris I have the right
and the duty to arrange her future.

48:08.060 --> 48:11.810
- You want me to scribe a letter, my Lady?
- I would do it myself if I could.

48:13.530 --> 48:18.090
But as a noble lady reading and writing
are beneath me.

48:21.370 --> 48:23.440
To whom would you like
the letter addressed?

48:23.560 --> 48:25.480
To your father.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.456
Well, Reverend Sir,

48:29.480 --> 48:35.909
I write to inform you to inform you
of the betrothal of your daughter Johanna.

48:35.990 --> 48:38.030
Betrothal?

48:38.270 --> 48:39.615
You cannot do that.

48:39.630 --> 48:41.750
- It has already been decided.
- But...

48:41.830 --> 48:43.849
Gerold's told me what happened
down by the river,

48:43.870 --> 48:46.087
and we have a good laugh over it.

48:46.110 --> 48:50.980
- It can't be.
- Marrying you off is his idea, silly goose.

48:55.740 --> 48:59.410
This was not the first time,
believe me.

48:59.730 --> 49:05.089
Gerold has been playing this game
for years. I have got used to it.

49:06.170 --> 49:10.490
Gerold is a knight.
He needs to conquer.

49:12.680 --> 49:16.040
Well now, you finally see?

49:17.920 --> 49:22.280
So... to get on with the letter.

49:23.240 --> 49:28.021
I hate you. You took me
into coming here.

49:28.070 --> 49:31.673
- I never should have listen.
- What do you mean?

49:31.710 --> 49:36.105
I was only allowed to attend the Schola
because of you. Now I have to leave too.

49:36.150 --> 49:38.620
But now you can become a soldier
like you always want it.

49:39.140 --> 49:39.780
You are wrong!

49:41.020 --> 49:44.180
Do you remember the letter father
gave me on the day we left?

49:44.260 --> 49:48.575
The Bishop gave it back to me,
and he intends to obey father's will.

49:48.620 --> 49:52.807
If I don't succeed at school, they'll have to
send me to the monastery at Fulda!

49:52.850 --> 49:53.850
I'd rather die!

49:56.050 --> 49:57.330
You came here to tell me that...

49:57.450 --> 49:59.930
I tell you that you brought me
nothing but trouble.

50:00.330 --> 50:03.052
You always have to be different,
no matter the price.

50:03.080 --> 50:07.080
You had to learn to read and write,
even though this is unnatural.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.840
I wish you've never been born!

51:21.260 --> 51:25.780
Behold the word of God!
And dare not enter...

58:18.250 --> 58:21.600
Home.

58:45.350 --> 58:48.850
3 years later

59:08.450 --> 59:11.370
Johannes Anglicus.

59:11.400 --> 59:17.119
Since her father was an Englishman,
the Abbot chose this monastic name for Johanna

59:17.480 --> 59:21.880
when she was accepted by the
brotherhood at Fulda.

59:22.800 --> 59:29.629
For years she was able to keep her secret.
And all the brothers took her to be a young man.

59:30.910 --> 59:36.602
Impressed by her linguistic ability,
the Abbot assigned Johanna the task

59:36.660 --> 59:40.660
of translating the collection
of Greek manuscripts on medicine.

59:41.300 --> 59:46.659
Thus she was able to study the works
of Hippocrates and other scholars.

59:47.020 --> 59:52.434
Johanna had retained her mother's
knowledge of healing plants and herbs.

59:52.490 --> 59:57.162
And she so impressed Brother Benjamin,
the monastery's medicast,

59:57.210 --> 01:00:00.021
that he made her his pupil.

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:03.999
As a woman, her intelligence and
her thirst for knowledge

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.009
had brought her delusion and content.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:14.040
Here in the monastery Johanna was praised
and rewarded for this very same qualities.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:21.687
Yet Johanna was constantly aware of
the danger she faced... everyday.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:24.430
Brother Johannes?

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.992
Are you wounded?

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.380
A small cut. Nothing more.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.164
Johanna knew that exposure
meant certain death.

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:44.773
She suffered most during
the reading of chapters.

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:50.115
If a brother had found her out or
merely harbored the suspicion,

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:54.280
she would hear about it there.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.523
Brothers, before we discuss the
temporal concerns of our monastic life,

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:11.870
- are there any transgressions to confess?
- Yes, father.

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:17.220
What offense have you committed,
Brother Thedo?

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:23.677
- I fell asleep while working in this scriptorium.
- Again?

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.907
I am unworthy and sinful, Father.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.210
Please bring the harshest of
punishments upon my head.

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:33.421
For three days you will not
be allowed at meals.

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:35.530
You're too lenient, Father.

01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.548
In light of the severity of my transgressions,

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.866
I beg you to extend it to a week.

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:45.600
God does not appreciate pride, Brother Thedo,
not even in suffering.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.317
Does anyone else have any
shortcomings to confess,

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.510
or any misconduct to the brethren?

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:05.468
It upsets me, but I must report
that a terrible sin

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:08.865
has been committed
within these very walls.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.980
A most heinous crime!

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.500
Will the sinner not come forward?

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.110
This brother intends to secretly
leave the monastery,

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.624
thereby breaking the holy oath
he made to God.

01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:21.867
It was my father's oath, not mine!

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:24.938
Your father placed you in the service of God.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:27.028
To take such a gift away from the almighty

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:29.108
would be an unforgivable sin.

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:34.346
Is it not also a sin to bind a man into
a life contrary to his very nature and will?

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.479
Your soul is in rebellion, Valentinus,
and therefore in terrible danger.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.160
In order to find your way back to God
in quiet and solitude,

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.190
you will not take meals with
the brethren for 30 days

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.883
and you will not be allowed
in the auditorium.

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:52.077
Why do you not just free me and
cast me out of the monastery?

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.950
You will also thank Brother Odilo
for his concern about your salvation

01:02:55.990 --> 01:03:00.058
and wash his feet with due humility.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:04.500
It is not faith that rules within these walls,
it is your tyranny.

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:21.715
The sickness of disobedience
has taken hold of you, Valentinus.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.279
For your own good, we must
banish it from your body.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:46.065
I hereby forbid you from entering
any public places.

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:50.534
I forbid you to eat or drink
in the presence of other people.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:54.183
I forbid you from washing
in any stretch of water and

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.941
from touching children
or giving them anything.

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.410
I beseech you, Abbot!
Let me go home!

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:04.147
Four fatherless children
are waiting for me.

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:09.277
- Heaven will care for the innocent.
- How, venerable Father, how?

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:11.440
If I did not go home they will die!

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.240
You may be dead in
the eyes of the world,

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.640
but still you live in
the eyes of the Lord.

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:33.750
Forgive me, Reverend Father.
This woman is not a leper.

01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:35.810
What are you talking about?

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:40.254
Her lesions are different, and must
therefore have a different origin.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:44.140
God has marked her.
We must not contradict his will.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.020
She is marked,
but not by leprosy.

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:54.213
Will God be pleased, if we
consign to a living dead one who

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.010
He Himself does not elected?

01:04:57.250 --> 01:05:01.397
Let me treat this woman,
so we do not make a sinful mistake.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.120
How do we know you have correctly
interpreted God's sign?

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.360
Is your pride so great that you
place it above your brothers'?

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.837
For if you administer to this woman,
you put the entire brotherhood at risk.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.186
Not if you would allow me
to leave the monastery with her.

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:21.001
I will vouch for Brother Johannes,
Reverend Abbot.

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:26.739
He is pious and upstanding, and will
withstand all temptations.

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:34.699
Thank you, brother!
God bless you.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.520
Mama!

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.400
Give me the baby, Arn!

01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:34.010
- What is your name?
- Arn.

01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:39.530
Arn, there is much work to be
done here. Will you help me?

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.270
Here!

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:22.610
- What is still missing?
- St. John's wort. For itching.

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:23.430
And?

01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.530
- And maybe some yarrow.
- Very good.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.699
You learn quickly.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.119
I can write my name too.
The priest showed me how.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.560
If it were possible and
your mother allowed it,

01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:49.949
would you like to attend
the monastic school?

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:56.015
Fulda lay far in the East. So the people
there were spared the struggle over

01:07:56.070 --> 01:08:03.623
succession to the Emperor's throne, that had
devastated other parts of the Frankish Empire.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:09.329
Before his death, Emperor Louis
divided the empire among his three sons.

01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:13.686
When the eldest, Lothair, tried to
claim the entire realm,

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:16.250
his two brothers rose up against him.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:59.450
Lothair lost the Battle of Fontenoy,
yet he retained a dominion

01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:02.930
stretching from the coast in the North
all the way down to Rome.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:09.370
Show your face, woman!

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.840
- Praised be the Lord.
- Praised be the Lord.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:46.542
So the years passed, and Johanna
was convinced

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:48.859
she had found her rightful place
in the world.

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:56.490
She perfected the art of disguise
and felt safe among the brothers.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.280
But then, the fever came
to the monastery.

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:11.850
We must cool his body. You know what to do.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.850
I do not know what more we can do.

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:20.850
Thucydides writes of such sickness.

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:25.850
It once wiped out a thousand Athenians.

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:48.850
You are released from your duty
for the afternoon, my son.

01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:50.850
You have a visitor.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:54.850
Your father.

01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:02.850
What's the matter?

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:06.850
Between us there is bad blood.

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:09.850
Time to reconcile then.

01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:18.789
Johannes, your father is almost
blind and has traveled a long way.

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:20.829
You will speak with him.

01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:24.850
Christian charity and the
Word of our Lord demand it.

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:12.849
My son! Thank the Lord Almighty God.

01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:25.789
When I heard the raid of the Normans, I asked
the bishop of Mainz for news and help.

01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:28.850
Even he could not get any.

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:35.850
I gave up hope. I thought my son was dead.

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:41.850
Then I heard about a miracle healer in Fulda.

01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:49.849
A brother Johannes Anglicus from Dorstadt

01:12:51.850 --> 01:12:54.819
Why don't you come and see me?

01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:58.850
It is barely five days' ride to Ingelheim.

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:14.850
Where's your sister?

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:22.850
The Norsemen are savage brutes!

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:27.850
Did she die with her shame?

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:32.850
She died untouched.

01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:36.850
God's will then.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:43.850
She was an unnatural child.

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:47.850
She would have made her peace with the world.

01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:56.850
My mother.

01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:59.850
How is she?

01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:03.829
She has left...

01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:04.839
No!

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:07.819
Gone and straight to hell!

01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:11.850
Even with her last breath, she was
still calling on her heathen god.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:17.809
Even when the midwife told her she would die...

01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:20.850
she still refused to keep
the Last Holy Sacraments!

01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:24.829
The midwife?

01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:29.850
She was Eve with the apple.

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.850
And you ruin her!

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:37.839
What did you say?

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:40.850
You were her ruin!

01:14:41.850 --> 01:14:44.850
Dare you accuse your father?

01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:48.850
Battle between God and Satan waged in our house!

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:52.850
From the first day I have fought
for your mother's soul.

01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:56.850
And to what end?

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:06.850
I live off what little the Earth provides.

01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:10.850
But the labor has broken me.

01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:14.850
And without a woman?

01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:19.850
But God has reunited us.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:24.850
With your intercession,
the abbot will surely take me in.

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:34.850
You want to stay in the monastery?

01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:38.850
It's my last hope.

01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:44.850
I don't want to die a beggar.

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.850
You will help me, won't you?

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:49.850
My son.

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:16.849
No, no, that cannot be.

01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:24.850
What have you done?

01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:27.829
Where is your brother? Where...

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:30.850
Where is Joh... Johannes?

01:16:32.850 --> 01:16:34.850
Where is Johannes?

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:39.850
You killed your older brother
so you can spare the younger one.

01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:43.829
I am not going to mess with this.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.829
Pious brothers.

01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:46.850
Come!

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.420
Johannes!

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.740
Sit down.

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.940
We have to lower the fever.

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.316
- We have to get you undressed.
- No... no!

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.130
We must apply cold linen.
Lift you shoulders.

01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:50.410
- Let me go!
- Gernot, Thedo!

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:56.884
Brother Johannes buried
his father only a few days ago.

01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:58.920
Give him sometime to calm himself.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.800
Start looking fresh linen.

01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:16.830
You're too weak to walk far.

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:20.514
Take the rowing boat hidden
in the weeds by the ford.

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:22.630
You have to leave right away.

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.996
The brothers revere you.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:30.220
To cure you, they will
undress you by force, so then...

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.140
their reverence will not save you.

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:43.290
How long have you known?

01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:46.130
For many years.

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:50.080
Why didn't you tell?

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.120
And rob God of one of His
most precious instruments?

01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:05.195
Tell the brother at the gate
he is needed here.

01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:06.910
That will give you time.

01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:17.820
May God protect you, sister.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.420
You must hurry.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.320
Come quickly, she's awake!

01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:37.751
- How are you feeling?
- I'm hungry.

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:43.412
This is a good sign! It has been two days
since we're able to feed you a bit of soup.

01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:46.380
- Where am I?
- Count Riculf's estate.

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:50.419
50 miles downstream from Fulda. Your boat
got tangled in the weed along the shore.

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:55.899
- You were half mad with fever.
- So you saved my life.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.267
And I thank God for
giving me the chance

01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:01.690
to repay you for what you did
for me and my family.

01:22:04.690 --> 01:22:06.850
Arn?

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.800
Pardon me, but...
But how should I address you?

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:18.000
Now... now that we know
what we know.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.230
Johanna. My name is Johanna.

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:24.804
Johanna!

01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:30.109
This is my wife, Bona.
And this is our daughter, Arnalda.

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:34.671
God bless the three of you.

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.847
Tell me what happened.

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:38.710
My mother got married again,
to a saddle-maker.

01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:42.184
As his apprentice, I accompanied him
here to the count's estate.

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.981
Because I knew how to read and write,
thanks to you,

01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:50.048
he invited me to stay on the estate
and help his steward.

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:52.029
The steward died two years ago,
and now...

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:56.563
- And now Arn is the count's best man.
- I have no doubt.

01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:59.400
- Please, eat.
- Thank you.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.927
When you have regained your strength,
You must tell us your whole story.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.058
We are burning with curiosity.

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.970
If with that I can reward
your family's kindness,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.200
then I will gladly tell you everything.

01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:19.590
- And what is that?
- An oak!

01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:24.338
That is right. They grow to be
hundreds of years old,

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:28.340
and if they could speak, they would
surely have hundreds of stories to tell.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.540
Just like you!

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:37.329
Now something harder. 8 times 7?
How many fingers did you fold down?

01:23:37.730 --> 01:23:40.343
- Five.
- And tens?

01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:43.410
- 50.
- And?

01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:47.490
- 6 and 50... 56.
- Good!

01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:50.360
What is that?

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.040
- That?
- Yes.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:59.113
Catherine was so wise that the heathen
emperor and his greatest scholars

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.179
could not turn her from her faith.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.270
Instead, she convinced the scholars that
God exists.

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:07.990
And she spoke so wonderfully of
His acts and the paradise

01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:11.110
that they all became Christians
on the spot.

01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:13.090
She did well then.

01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:17.891
But she paid for her courage with her life.
Many were afraid of her wisdom.

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.859
But now she is in heaven and
she watches over you.

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.909
And she taught us something important.

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:27.250
We have to stay true to our convictions

01:24:27.850 --> 01:24:31.490
no matter how high the price.

01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:56.272
A pilgrimage?
To Rome?

01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:59.715
Thanks to you I'm healthy
again and strong enough

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:01.967
to go out and see the world.

01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:03.880
But that is far too dangerous!

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:07.186
Not if I travel with other pilgrims,
disguised as a man.

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:09.753
We thought perhaps
you would stay with us.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.432
As you can see there's
always work to be done.

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:15.660
And here you would
always be safe.

01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:23.825
I appreciate your kindness, but...
I have lived so long as a man,

01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:26.170
and I'm afraid I would not be
of much help to you.

01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:28.034
- But...
- Let her!

01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:33.359
She is meant for a different path, and
we have no right to divert her from it.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.360
I will miss you terribly.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.721
A gift from the count, and if you
do not take it,

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:45.006
I'm going to send you back
to the monastery.

01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:48.910
I do not know how to thank you.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.627
Your father promised me
that he would teach you.

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:06.530
Maybe one day you will even
have a tutor.

01:26:12.130 --> 01:26:15.693
Saint Catherine...
will help you learn

01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:19.600
to use that knowledge
for the benefit of others.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:25.600
So take good care of her.

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:45.140
Despite poverty and overcrowding,

01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:51.506
Rome remained the powerful attraction
for people from far away.

01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:55.687
For pilgrims and other travelers
from abroad needing help or lodging,

01:27:55.730 --> 01:28:00.000
A schola was always a secure haven.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.217
Thanks to her name "Anglicus,"

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:10.119
Johanna was welcomed to the
Schola Anglorum with open arms.

01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:19.109
Before three years had passed, Johanna's
name was known to all Rome.

01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:25.760
<i>Pater Noster, qui es in caelis.
Sanctificetur nomen tuum...</i>

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:32.301
We must use this day before the Moon
passes into Gemini.,

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:35.640
an inauspicious time
for blood letting.

01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:06.467
His condition worsens everyday.
You must do something.

01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:07.470
Must I?

01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:09.850
What if it's God's will that he die?

01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:11.651
Your confidence is misplaced, my son.

01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.669
You're still too inexperienced
to be elected Pope.

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.837
You underestimate me, Arsenius.

01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:20.067
For weeks I've been a Pope's proxy,
everyone needs my council.

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:22.871
But the people of Rome do not
know what goes on inside these walls.

01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:25.869
If Sergius's soon to die they'll
choose another for the Pope...

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:29.890
and Saint Peter's Throne will be
out of our reach for years to come.

01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:33.503
You're destined to be Pope, my son,

01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:37.331
and add this last and greatest jewel
to our family crown,

01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:41.160
but we must not act rashly.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:47.319
So, what if you are the one
to save Pope Sergius?

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:52.630
My name would be on everyone's lips.

01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:56.748
In the streets, there is talk
of a healer from Franconia.

01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:58.990
A foreigner...
physiking a pope?

01:29:59.110 --> 01:30:04.802
They say that he can diagnose a disease
by examining the patient's urine.

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:08.700
It's said that he's cured
even lepers.

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:16.060
Johannes Anglicus!

01:30:17.530 --> 01:30:22.450
- Are you Johannes Anglicus?
- I am.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:41.429
Ah, the famous miracle healer!
We are all burning with anticipation.

01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:51.550
This urine from the Pope
is only an hour old.

01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:56.460
Would you care to tell us
what you can read in it?

01:31:16.570 --> 01:31:21.799
It's a miracle! Our Holy Father
will give birth to a child.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.828
Enodius! You gave him
a pregnant woman's urine?

01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:38.949
I had to be sure that Pope is not
falling into the hands of a charlatan.

01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:45.132
He is a charlatan. Just like all
the others. I don't trust them.

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:49.300
I'm Anastasius, Papal Nomenclator.

01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:53.740
I sent for you to hear your opinion
on the Pope's condition.

01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:57.170
Your reputation precedes you.

01:31:57.250 --> 01:32:01.803
<i>Pater Noster, qui es in caelis:
Sanctificetur nomen tuum...</i>

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:08.569
Ah! That pain! I...
can bear it no longer!

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.760
Waldipert! More wine!

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:18.320
More!

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.510
Holy Father.

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:26.190
This is Johannes Anglicus,
a healer with great renown.

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:31.110
Another doctor! To hell with him!
Where is that wine?

01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:36.292
- No wine! Bring water!
- I want wine!

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:39.300
Forgive me, Holy Father.

01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:51.370
At least... this one does not have
the hands of a... butcher!

01:32:54.450 --> 01:33:00.319
Another blood-letting could kill him.
Will you prevent this from happening again?

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.760
What're you giving him?

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.160
His Holiness suffers from gout.

01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:14.560
The sickness is widespread in my country.

01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:17.678
He shows all the symptoms as
described by Hippocrates.

01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:21.310
God would never allow such
heathen teachings to cure the Pope.

01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:23.057
Continue.

01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:26.940
I'm giving him root of colchicum
and herban to help him sleep.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.820
The worst pain should be over soon.

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:34.500
Good.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.210
Drink this.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.200
His Holiness needs rest.

01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.159
Surely God can still hear our brothers' prayers
if they are spoken in the hallway.

01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.864
He's old and weak, Aio.
He won't live to see another winter.

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:23.939
It is tempting indeed.
But you're asking for only a small sum.

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:30.929
Why not? Should I one day need, say,
your influence with the people of Rome.

01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:34.170
I may ask you for return
of this favor.

01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:36.970
But what if the Pope refuses
to make me a bishop?

01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:42.040
Rest with it, Aio. Papal decisions have not
been made by the Pope for a long time.

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:08.180
- How do you feel?
- The pain is gone.

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:13.980
The pains... are gone!

01:35:16.650 --> 01:35:20.330
I feel new-born.
And I'm hungry!

01:35:20.730 --> 01:35:23.770
- Bring me some wine!
- Absolutely not!

01:35:24.690 --> 01:35:27.210
A plate of vegetables
and a jug of water.

01:35:27.490 --> 01:35:29.680
The devil must have sent you.

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:35.239
I will not permit you to undo a week
of recovery with a single meal.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.280
What? An entire week?

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:44.989
Johannes Anglicus never
left your side, Holiness.

01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:49.197
Then it must have been God
who sent you.

01:35:49.230 --> 01:35:54.699
How can I thank you for
your services, Johannes Anglicus?

01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:02.652
Allow me to return
and see to your recovery.

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:07.530
No, I wish for you to remain here.

01:36:08.410 --> 01:36:13.529
There's something unusual about you,
something missing from these walls.

01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:21.194
If your wish it, Holiness,
I'm your humble servant.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.320
Then it is settled.

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.838
Holiness, the Papal Court
is meeting.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.651
Would you care to preside.

01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:37.029
Please, Arighis, Anastasius has been leading
these meetings for quite some time now.

01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:42.150
Forgive me, Holy Father,

01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:46.780
but the people did not choose
Anastasius as their supreme shepherd.

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:51.260
They chose you. And didn't you
just say you felt new-born?

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:53.300
Did I?

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:56.730
It would be a sign.

01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:05.218
And how long would this take, Mamertus?

01:37:05.250 --> 01:37:07.650
Construction could be completed
by year's end.

01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:12.202
I've secured the services of
of the best craftsmen in Rome.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.853
And how expensive is
this undertaking?

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.600
With the Pope's support, it would...

01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:33.630
Your Holiness, is this wise?

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:39.100
You should not put your recuperation
at risk just to observe this meeting.

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:42.740
Your concern for my
health does you honor, Nomenclator.

01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:47.730
However, I am feeling
quite well, thank you.

01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:53.329
And I'm here not just to observe.
I am here to preside.

01:37:53.610 --> 01:37:57.090
I rejoice to hear it,
as does all Rome.

01:37:58.090 --> 01:38:00.680
Well, proceed.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.091
Holy Father, I was requesting permission

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:07.366
to rebuild the old orphanage
into a hostelry for pilgrims.

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.840
And what would become of the orphans?

01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.930
There are poor houses that can take them.

01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:16.470
This hostelry will be the pride of Rome.

01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:20.872
Counts, dukes, even kings
will seek to stay there.

01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:25.572
Orphans are no less dear
to God than kings.

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.220
Your request is denied, Mamertus.

01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.740
I've already made a deal
with the Nomenclator.

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:34.700
We have an arrangement, and payment
has already been made.

01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:36.355
Payment?

01:38:36.370 --> 01:38:41.121
Well, Holy Father, Mamertus offered a
generous donation to the Church

01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:44.130
in order to expedite the success
of his undertaking.

01:38:45.130 --> 01:38:49.317
Ah! Blessed are all the merciful,
for they shall find mercy.

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.800
We thank you for your
generous donation, Mamertus.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:57.480
It will be used to help the orphans.
God will repay you.

01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:09.950
Next.

01:39:11.150 --> 01:39:13.070
Tell me about yourself, Johannes.

01:39:13.150 --> 01:39:17.020
You come from Franconia,
yet you are called "Anglicus".

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:21.575
My father came from Britannia
to preach God's word to the Saxons.

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:24.540
Ah, the Saxons. A godless people!

01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:27.290
Most are Christians now...

01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:31.686
as much as any can be who are brought
to the faith with fire and sword.

01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:35.174
It is the Church's duty
to convert the heathens.

01:39:35.210 --> 01:39:39.040
What value has any pledge
exacted by force?

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.683
Yet Christ commands us
to spread God's word

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:47.120
among all the races of the earth
and baptize His people.

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:50.440
But... consider the order
of the commandment.

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:53.950
First, teach the people,
then baptize them.

01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:59.589
How could we offer the sacrament of baptism
before faith is lodged in the heart?

01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:01.930
You reason well.

01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:04.500
Where were you educated?

01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:08.260
A Greek schoolmaster, by the
name of Aesculapius, taught me.

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:13.369
Then I went to the Schola in Dorstadt,
and later I joined the brotherhood at Fulda.

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:18.557
Fulda. The Abbot recently presented me
with a beautiful psalm, Ah...

01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:23.282
When I thank him, I shall mention
your skilled service.

01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:28.200
- I fear he would not speak well of me.
- Why is that?

01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:32.437
He holds obedience
be the greatest of all religious vows.

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.960
Yet to me it has always
come the hardest.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.360
Is that so?

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.457
What about the other vows?

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.710
I was born into poverty and
am accustomed to it.

01:40:45.190 --> 01:40:48.070
What about chastity?

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:53.818
I have always resisted
the temptations of women.

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.740
I'm glad to hear it.

01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:59.779
Soon after Enodius was expelled
from the Palace,

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:03.260
and Sergius made
Johanna his personal physician.

01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:06.497
He included her in
political decisions as well.

01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:12.905
Over the next few years, Johanna became
one of the Pope's most trusted confidants.

01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:15.781
Nicephorus would make a
good bishop, Holiness.

01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:16.410
Yes?

01:41:16.730 --> 01:41:19.880
He is not Roman, so many will
be opposed to his appointment,

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:23.320
but he is a man of God
and will remain true to you.

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.769
So it will be.
Today I shall...

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:30.160
Holy Father! The Bishops
need to see you urgently.

01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:33.430
What's all this?

01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:38.153
Emperor Lothair is on the march to Rome,
recruiting troops in every city.

01:41:38.190 --> 01:41:39.950
And he'll be here in ten days.

01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:42.880
He has sworn revenge against Rome,
for our insulting him.

01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:44.562
I predicted it!

01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:48.020
Not to wait for the Emperor's approval
of your consecration...

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:50.200
was a provocation.

01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:52.991
It was a sign of strength!

01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:55.100
The Frankish throne needs us
more than we need it.

01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.890
But now his is marching on Rome.

01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:59.290
Spare me your point, you!
I do not wish to hear it.

01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:35.060
- What is so important, Count Gerold?
- It's been another incident.

01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:39.702
Five soldiers pillaged a farm stead
and nearly beat the farmer to death.

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.540
Have them whipped.
Anything else?

01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:50.498
You didn't disturb me just for
this trifling matter?

01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:55.250
My Lord, with respect,
this entire campaign is irresponsible.

01:42:56.050 --> 01:42:58.623
Instead of protecting our coast
from the Norsemen,

01:42:58.650 --> 01:43:01.332
we are recruiting peasants
who don't even understand

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.101
why we're marching against the Pope.

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.200
Sergius has publicly defied
my rule of authority.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.278
But he has no army! So why are we
gathering nearly 5,000 men?

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.873
The more impressively we're marching to Rome,
the more quickly the Pope will surrender.

01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:18.146
And the sooner these blockheads
can get back to their squalid homes.

01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:20.803
What has seemed you would
rather be yourself.

01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:26.299
As you know, I haven't. No home.
The army has become my home. Still...

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.707
Enough.
Instead of lecturing your Emperor,

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:32.380
you should be tending
the black sheep in your rings.

01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:34.300
You may go.

01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:43.450
By the way, Gerold. A bishop from
Rome arrived a short while ago,

01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:46.330
and seeks an audience with me.

01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:51.480
Apparently I was right to march
with so many men.

01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:04.470
Follow me please!

01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:17.380
Arighis?

01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:24.495
- What can I do?
- The city's best engineers!

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.930
Can you summon them?
At once.

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:42.550
Emperor Lothair!
Before this holiest shrine,

01:45:42.630 --> 01:45:47.749
the Tabernacle of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and his earthly representative,

01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:52.229
kneel and show due respect!

01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:57.605
It is you, Holy Father,
who owes me a sign of respect,

01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:59.740
and I am here to demand it!

01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:20.159
Lord! Give us a sign!

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:24.400
Is seeing us...
not sign enough?

01:47:00.650 --> 01:47:06.945
Behold the hand of God which has brought
this holiest of His altars against you.

01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:09.732
God has revealed himself to you, Lothair,

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:15.065
If you respect Him, His power,
and His anointed representative,

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:17.812
then you are welcome in Rome.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:21.710
However, if you dare show your sword
at the tomb of the Apostle,

01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:27.349
the wrath of God will descend upon you...
and your soldiers!

01:48:42.130 --> 01:48:44.010
Can you be so pitiless, Lord?

01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:49.598
I thought I had banished him
from my heart.

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.760
Must you test my resolve again?

01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.600
Johanna?

01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:05.990
It really is you.

01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:17.700
I never thought our apparatus would work
with such heavy doors.

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:27.810
My men and I
returned one day too late.

01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:36.889
I've searched for you for days but...
I also knew the Norsemen to be...

01:49:37.010 --> 01:49:39.080
merciless creatures who
often abduct women.

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:49.560
I buried your brother
next to my daughters.

01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:57.349
And... after many weeks, we still
haven't find a trace of your hair.

01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:04.140
Forgive me, I... I buried you in spirit.

01:50:16.770 --> 01:50:18.410
But you're alive!

01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:23.610
How did you come to this?

01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:27.490
God led me here on an unusual path.

01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:30.360
Why did you want to marry that boy?

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.160
- You... you yourself ordered it.
- What?

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.560
You wanted me to marry me off.

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:43.310
She had told me everything.
She knew about us.

01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:48.790
About what happened at the river.
How could she'd known if not from you?

01:50:48.810 --> 01:50:51.304
No, I... I swear to you Johanna,
I never...

01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:54.646
She said I was just another one
of your many conquests.

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:56.560
And you believed her?

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:02.480
Even then I wanted you more than
I have wanted any woman before.

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.870
But didn't want you as my lover.

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.100
I wanted you as my wife.

01:51:41.210 --> 01:51:44.360
Finally! The Savior of Rome
shows his face.

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.685
We owe you a debt of gratitude,
Johannes Anglicus.

01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:53.000
It was God's will, Holiness,
that you and your papacy be saved.

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:56.830
I have decided to name you
Papal Nomenclator.

01:51:59.510 --> 01:52:02.550
But Anastasius has held
that position for years.

01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:07.470
God has chosen you as his instrument,
and I mean to obey his will.

01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:12.820
- You are too gracious, Holy Father.
- And yet you hesitated.

01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:19.324
Johannes, it is an exceptional position
and exceptional honor.

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:23.765
- You will be first Secretary to his Holiness.
- Do not press him, Arighis!

01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:28.690
Surely we can allow the defender of the
Papal Throne a night to consider.

01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:32.370
That cannot be!

01:52:33.490 --> 01:52:36.014
Word has spread from the entire palace.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:40.831
A foreigner pursued your position?
You'll be disgrace to our family!

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:44.120
I have distrusted this priest
from the very beginning.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.630
If only I had not
listened to you!

01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:57.147
I have to wonder, the entire evening
the Pope doesn't touch anything

01:52:57.190 --> 01:53:03.139
but fruit and water. I was told he is
a lover of rich food and wine!

01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:06.940
For years, his physician has barred
such pleasures.

01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:11.098
- Sergius eats like a penitent.
- He doesn't behave like one.

01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:15.683
Instead of bowing to my power, he frightened
my soldiers with his cheap trickery.

01:53:15.730 --> 01:53:20.204
Preventing this would have been a
welcomed proof of your loyalty.

01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:24.160
Not even the inner circle knew
of the scheme, my Lord.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.713
We thought the work being done in the
Cathedral was merely strengthen the doors.

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:32.957
And from what we can glean the physician...
had a hand in this as well?

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.600
A medicast was behind this large plan?

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:40.190
I admit we underestimated him
and... his influence.

01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:46.230
If he is so influential...

01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:54.460
Then perhaps he should be made
to disappear.

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:03.969
Why chop off only a branch,
when we can fell the entire tree?

01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:10.810
I see you were not exaggerating when
you called yourself ambitious.

01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:18.319
I'm sure you understand... that I will
have to leave Rome as soon as possible.

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:24.222
Something, well, were to happen to
the Pope while I'm still in the city,

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:27.950
suspicion would fall on me and on every
successor I might support.

01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:34.110
Not to mention it is costing me a fortune
to keep this worthless soldiers.

01:54:34.190 --> 01:54:39.802
Given the upcoming election of a new Pope,
my money could be put to better use.

01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:45.659
- The votes of the people can be expensive.
- My Lord.

01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:51.117
I've heard that Lothair
is about to part Rome.

01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:55.881
I'm no longer going to serve the Emperor.
Not now that I know you're alive.

01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:57.553
You will lose Villaris!

01:54:57.570 --> 01:55:02.004
Yes. But I have some good friends
outside the army who will stand by me.

01:55:02.050 --> 01:55:04.640
And they need good men
to work for them.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.040
We could start a life together, Johanna.

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:16.120
Sergius has asked me to
become Nomenclator.

01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:18.950
I can do so much good at his side.

01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:22.270
But you are in grave danger at his side.
If you are discovered you would be killed.

01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:24.409
I've learned to accept that danger.

01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:26.990
You are that attached to the Pope
that you will run at your risk.

01:55:27.230 --> 01:55:29.340
I'm now attached to life as a man!

01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:33.656
I'm independent, free to act and think
as I wish and I can be useful.

01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:36.550
I have means here that other women
never dream of.

01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:38.044
You want me to give all this up?

01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:42.484
To live the confined existence of a wife,
tied to daily chores and duties?

01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:45.935
I... I have no desire to
tie you to anything.

01:55:45.970 --> 01:55:47.890
I would honor you
and care for you.

01:55:47.970 --> 01:55:49.530
I have long cared for myself.

01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:06.220
Forgive me. I love you.

01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:10.620
But my place is here.

01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:19.610
Even if I have to accept your decision,
damn...

01:56:19.770 --> 01:56:24.250
you're in constant danger,
and I will not forsake you again.

01:58:56.970 --> 01:59:03.359
Heavenly Father! Today the people
of Rome are gathered...

01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:07.880
to choose a new Lord Pope.
According to law...

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.800
every Roman citizen, clergy and
laymen alike...

01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:18.178
may raise his voice to tell us
what God has inspired in him.

01:59:18.230 --> 01:59:23.629
I nominate Mercurius,
Bishop of Siena.

01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:28.538
A wise man and a
devoted servant of the Church.

01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:31.740
Mercurius is a candidate.

01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:42.675
Romans! I submit the name of
Anastasius,

01:59:42.730 --> 01:59:49.065
Bishop of Castellum,
son of noble Arsenius.

01:59:49.130 --> 01:59:52.010
He will defend not only the
Christian faith,

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:55.841
but also the interests
of the Roman people.

01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:57.880
Your interest, you mean!

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:00.440
Anastasius...

02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:04.230
You've bought your Bishop with Aio!

02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:11.110
The man is right! Anastasius
conspired with Aio!

02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:15.750
Let me through!
The people need to hear this!

02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:19.900
Anastasius is also a candidate.

02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:28.340
Would anyone else like to
nominate a worthy contender?

02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:37.090
I nominate myself!

02:00:37.410 --> 02:00:40.810
I had brought the Pope a noble house.

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:45.120
I donated my property
to the Church!

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:49.161
- He had a knife! Did you see that?
- Do you see the danger you are in?

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:54.469
Whoever... would like to nominate
someone else? Come forward now!

02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:59.752
No one? So there is these
two candidates!

02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:01.990
Wait!

02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:08.540
Romans, you know I have served
the Holy Throne for many years,

02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:11.260
and I want only what is
good for Rome.

02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:18.810
Anastasius! And surely his father too.

02:01:20.410 --> 02:01:25.290
Their plan is working. Anastasius
is being elected Pope so to speak.

02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:32.360
This is Rome, Johanna. Here...
inconvenient people get killed,

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:35.320
no matter how good or
powerful they are.

02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:41.080
Then I must leave Rome?

02:01:44.590 --> 02:01:49.270
I only want you to live, Johanna,
with or without me.

02:01:51.190 --> 02:01:53.882
You deserve to be happy and
do good but...

02:01:53.910 --> 02:02:00.099
for that you don't need to be in Rome.
You stay here, you will die.

02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:05.460
If this is the true face of Rome,

02:02:09.970 --> 02:02:11.210
I will go with you.

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:27.680
Once he is elected, Anastasius will
move against you immediately.

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:30.080
We must leave.

02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:55.620
Through the will of the Almighty God
and the people of our holy city,

02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:01.570
you have been elected our new Lord Pope
and Supreme Bishop of Rome!

02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:44.705
Merciful God, is it truly your will...

02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:47.700
That someone such as I should
sit in St. Peter's chair?

02:03:49.410 --> 02:03:51.706
Or will your just wrath strike me down

02:03:51.730 --> 02:03:54.330
the moment the Papal Crown
is placed on my head?

02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:58.853
But then, why would you
have led me here?

02:03:58.890 --> 02:04:01.920
Why would you have tolerated me
in your garden all these years?

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:07.719
Hold your hand over me Lord,
and I will be a faithful servant unto You.

02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:12.610
Long live Johannes Anglicus,

02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:18.469
by God decree, our Chief Bishop,
and Universal Pope.

02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:38.220
Long live Johannes Anglicus, by God decree,
our Chief Bishop, and Universal Pope.

02:04:50.410 --> 02:04:57.410
Long live Johannes Anglicus, by God decree,
our Chief Bishop, and Universal Pope.

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:22.300
Arighis.

02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:26.300
Holiness.

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:32.930
May I too benefit from your experience,
your competence and your good heart,

02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:36.730
as my Nomenclator?

02:05:38.370 --> 02:05:42.080
- It would be an honor to serve you.
- Then it shall be.

02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:47.760
From what I have heard I have you
to thank for this heavy burden.

02:05:55.670 --> 02:05:59.710
Leave me alone for a moment
with the Count.

02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:12.979
- You summoned me, Holiness?
- Will you ever forgive me?

02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:20.456
The Almighty and I seem to be
in contest for the same woman.

02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:23.690
Believe me, she wished she could
split herself in two.

02:06:24.490 --> 02:06:27.730
Because I know I would have a
fulfilling life at your side.

02:06:28.570 --> 02:06:31.240
But apparently, this is my calling.

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:33.840
Please, understand.

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:36.320
I will try.

02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:43.320
All my life I have searched for God.
And now, I've found Him.

02:06:44.110 --> 02:06:46.525
He's in the hope that people put in me.

02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:48.885
He's in the good deed I can do for them.

02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:53.430
When I'm doing God's will,
I can feel Him in my heart.

02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:59.300
Anastasius will recover quickly
from his defeat.

02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:04.020
Then he will do everything in his power
to trouble and depose you.

02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:07.020
You know exactly what he is like.

02:07:09.610 --> 02:07:14.689
Then stay with me, as Superista,
Captain of the Papal guard.

02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:19.450
I'm stronger,
when I know you are near.

02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:24.280
You're playing with fire, Johanna.

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:29.554
Johanna began her papacy
full of purpose and zeal,

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:32.440
and she was determined
to keep her promise.

02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:39.830
She knew the suffering of the Roman
people better than anyone,

02:07:40.150 --> 02:07:43.350
and she did all in her power
to alleviate it.

02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:46.192
She sent physicians to the slums,

02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:49.229
and decree that collections from
every third Sunday

02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.380
were given to the poor houses.

02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:58.809
Soon, the Romans named her
"Papa Populi"... the people's Pope.

02:08:00.210 --> 02:08:04.763
But Johanna wanted to be more than
just a merciful Bishop of Rome.

02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:10.409
After all, she was spiritual head
of the entire Christian Church.

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:16.680
She summoned all the bishops to
Rome for a Synod.

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:21.079
Many Church doctrines were reviewed
and reconsidered

02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:24.270
and more resolutions passed
than ever before.

02:08:26.590 --> 02:08:28.430
Thank you, you may go.

02:08:32.710 --> 02:08:36.500
Thank you, Selestinus. I won't be
needing you any more tonight.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.480
Merciful God!

02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:13.830
Now we must leave Rome.

02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:16.510
If you're discovered, they will
torture you to death.

02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:20.630
Johanna!

02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:26.459
I understand you better than you think.
I know your heart is torn, but...

02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:30.500
now you are with child, the decision
is out of our hands.

02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:35.020
Give me until Easter.

02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:39.770
That's more than three months away!

02:09:41.210 --> 02:09:43.810
I can do so much with that time.

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:48.730
Yes, but... whatever you'd do
your successes can easily undo.

02:09:50.010 --> 02:09:52.440
Not when they see that it is good.

02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.840
If need be, I will get you out of the city,
even against your will.

02:10:06.230 --> 02:10:08.882
Holiness, this cannot truly
be your intent!

02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:09.630
It is!

02:10:10.630 --> 02:10:12.292
Why else would I
trouble you with this?

02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:13.710
A school for girls?

02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:18.461
Never before...
Never has been such a thing!

02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:21.627
You mean we should abandon
the idea just because it's new?

02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:25.420
We can only be sure
of one truth,

02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:30.758
the truth that has been handed down
to us through the ages.

02:10:30.810 --> 02:10:33.570
Everything that is old...
was once new.

02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:37.257
Holiness! As I'm sure you know,

02:10:37.290 --> 02:10:40.050
the more a girl learns,
the smaller her womb becomes.

02:10:40.130 --> 02:10:44.673
- Where did you read?
- It... It's commonly knowledge.

02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:47.840
So common that no one has
bothered to write it down?

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:50.360
You do not need books for
what is obvious to all.

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.498
No one has written that wool comes
from sheep, and yet, it's known to all.

02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:58.915
Then how do you explain the
extraordinary fertility

02:10:58.950 --> 02:11:00.750
of educated women like Laeta?

02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:03.590
She exchanged letters with St. Jerome,

02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:07.580
who reports she brought
15 children into the world.

02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:08.900
An aberration.

02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.420
A rare exception to the rule.

02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:16.529
Jordanus, if I remember correctly,
your sister Julia can read and write.

02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:18.420
Just enough to keep the
household books.

02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:21.182
And nonetheless, according to your theory,

02:11:21.210 --> 02:11:24.570
this abilities must have had
their effect on her fertility.

02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:26.810
How many children
has she birthed?

02:11:29.610 --> 02:11:32.320
- I haven't counted them.
- Is it not twelve?

02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:38.160
Another aberration?

02:11:43.710 --> 02:11:47.907
I promise, if in 20 years there aren't
any children left in Rome,

02:11:47.950 --> 02:11:52.310
I will close the school.
I thank you all.

02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:02.858
His Holiness does not understand that
he needs strong allies.

02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:06.740
He has not learned that...
even a Pope must show gratitude.

02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:10.770
Well, what do you expect
from a stranger?

02:12:11.370 --> 02:12:13.690
Maybe we should
build a school for him.

02:12:14.010 --> 02:12:16.570
Let me put it bluntly, my friends,

02:12:16.890 --> 02:12:20.255
the Church does not need a
glib trouble of the people,

02:12:20.290 --> 02:12:22.720
It needs a man of influence.

02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:26.759
A man whose family has shaped
Rome's destiny for decades.

02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:32.479
- No doubt you mean a man like you.
- Who is not afraid to show his strength.

02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:36.030
You want to take the
papal throne by force?

02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:41.870
- Let us call it... liberate.
- Are you sure it can be done?

02:12:42.150 --> 02:12:45.550
Such a bold plan requires the
support of influential people.

02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:51.540
It seems I have that already.

02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:53.240
Still...

02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:56.660
Is that also true with
the Papal Guard?

02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:59.730
They are devoted to their captain.

02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:04.250
So he... seems to be the key
to our success.

02:13:57.530 --> 02:14:01.720
- Are you feeling unwell?
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

02:14:03.195 --> 02:14:07.955
Holy Father! Show mercy and give me
your cloak. Mine is old and dirty.

02:14:09.715 --> 02:14:14.265
With that ring on your finger,
I can feed my family for a year.

02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:18.260
We don't need a procession.
We need bread!

02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:21.620
Here! Look what we have to eat!

02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:46.240
Arighis, what if it's a trap?

02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:51.190
Calm yourself, Holiness, no one
threaten the Superista.

02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:58.910
Watch out!

02:15:27.250 --> 02:15:29.920
Arighis...
Stop them. Now!

02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:37.000
I command you to help
your Superista.

02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:38.300
Holiness!

02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:39.469
Lean on me!

02:18:04.610 --> 02:18:09.689
<i>After Johanna's death, Anastasius
occupied the Lateran Palace</i>

02:18:10.705 --> 02:18:13.615
<i>and claimed St. Peter's Throne
for himself.</i>

02:18:15.094 --> 02:18:19.252
<i>But the Romans, horrified by
this violent grab for power,</i>

02:18:19.295 --> 02:18:21.375
<i>refused to accept him.</i>

02:18:22.695 --> 02:18:28.284
<i>Soon words spread that it was Anastasius
who had ordered Gerold's murder.</i>

02:18:28.725 --> 02:18:32.004
<i>Even his own supporters
turned against him.</i>

02:18:32.084 --> 02:18:36.594
<i>And Anastasius was deposed and
sent to monastic exile.</i>

02:18:37.594 --> 02:18:42.275
<i>But hatred festered within him.
And after many years,</i>

02:18:42.355 --> 02:18:46.355
<i>he finally found a way
to take his revenge on Johanna.</i>

02:18:47.875 --> 02:18:50.477
<i>He wrote the "Liber Pontificalis,"</i>

02:18:50.504 --> 02:18:55.532
<i>a chronicle of all the popes.
All except Johanna.</i>

02:18:55.584 --> 02:19:01.974
<i>He concealed her papacy,
and erased her entire existence.</i>

02:19:02.575 --> 02:19:06.691
<i>Rome and the Church
were delighted with the book</i>

02:19:06.735 --> 02:19:10.094
<i>and make sure to
circulate it widely.</i>

02:19:10.254 --> 02:19:15.364
<i>It helped them forget this most
shameful chapter in their history.</i>

02:19:21.725 --> 02:19:28.954
<i>40 years after Johanna's death, I too heard
about the suppression of her papacy.</i>

02:19:29.195 --> 02:19:31.594
<i>And made my way to Rome.</i>

02:19:32.035 --> 02:19:35.795
<i>So extraordinary a life
must not be forgotten.</i>

02:19:36.355 --> 02:19:41.824
<i>There should be at least one manuscript
where the truth can be read.</i>

02:19:47.065 --> 02:19:53.294
<i>My father Arn, my entire family
have so much to thank her for.</i>

02:19:54.255 --> 02:19:57.735
<i>This act is the very least
I could do for Johanna.</i>

02:20:00.495 --> 02:20:03.685
<i>Following in her footsteps, I wonder...</i>

02:20:03.885 --> 02:20:08.676
