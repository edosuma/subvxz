SO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
YOU DID THAT. YOU KILLED HIM.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.995
YES, I DID.

01:28.523 --> 01:29.959
HE WAS RED JOHN.

01:30.046 --> 01:32.353
RED JOHN, THE FAMOUS
SERIAL KILLER? THAT RED JOHN?

01:32.440 --> 01:34.746
YES. HE KILLED
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

01:34.833 --> 01:38.054
SO WHAT YOU DID, IN YOUR MIND,
IT WAS LIKE A RIGHTEOUS KILL.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.447
YES.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.231
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HIM?

01:41.318 --> 01:42.580
HE TOLD ME HE WAS.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.016
AND YOU BELIEVED HIM.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.062
HE KNEW THINGS
ABOUT MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER

01:46.149 --> 01:48.020
THAT ONLY RED JOHN
WOULD KNOW.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.805
WHAT WAS THAT?

01:49.892 --> 01:52.329
HOW THEY SMELLED ON THE NIGHT
THAT HE KILLED THEM.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.941
OKAY.

01:56.028 --> 02:00.163
SO DID, UH, DID ANYONE ELSE
HEAR HIM SAY THIS TO YOU?NO.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.992
YOU CAN ONLY ASSERT HE SAID
IT. YOU CAN'T PROVE IT.

02:03.079 --> 02:06.126
NO, I CAN'T, BUT THE GUN HE'S
CARRYING CERTAINLY BACKS ME UP.

02:06.213 --> 02:09.694
AND IF YOU CHECK HIS CELL PHONE,
HE RECEIVED A CALL AT 1:15

02:09.781 --> 02:12.436
FROM AN FBI AGENT
BY THE NAME OF CRAIG O'LAUGHLIN,

02:12.523 --> 02:16.832

WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

02:24.056 --> 02:26.972
HERE'S THE THING.
THAT'S A GREAT STORY YOU TELL.

02:27.059 --> 02:29.627
IF IT WAS TRUE, YOU COULD
PROBABLY ASK FOR MANSLAUGHTER,

02:29.714 --> 02:31.368

02:31.455 --> 02:32.630
IT IS TRUE.

02:32.717 --> 02:35.155

BUT THE PROBLEM IS, PATRICK,

02:35.242 --> 02:37.461
THE MAN YOU KILLED--
HIS NAME IS TIMOTHY CARTER.

02:37.548 --> 02:39.028

02:44.076 --> 02:45.774
WE'VE ALREADY LOOKED
AT HIS CELL PHONE.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.341
I GOT THE DETAILS
RIGHT HERE.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.257
HE LOGGED ZERO CALLS
FROM THIS O'LAUGHLIN--

NONE.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.306
[sighs] AND GUESS WHAT ELSE?

02:58.700 --> 03:01.311

12:03.244 --> 12:04.158
[gasps]JANE?

12:04.245 --> 12:06.029
YES.

12:06.116 --> 12:07.857
I'M NOT SURE
IF THIS IS APPROPRIATE.

12:07.944 --> 12:11.295
NO, THAT'S ALRIGHT.
I'M HAPPY TO TALK WITH THEM.

12:11.382 --> 12:12.862
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,

12:12.949 --> 12:15.647
WE'LL TAKE CHARLAINE
OUT TO PLAY, SHALL WE?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.171
GIVE YOU A MOMENT.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.739
[whispers] THANK YOU.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.700
CAN I OFFER YOU
SOME COFFEE OR TEA?

12:24.787 --> 12:26.833
COFFEE WOULD BE GREAT,
THANK YOU.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.749
THIS MUST BE
A TERRIBLE TIME FOR YOU,

12:29.836 --> 12:33.100
AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.628
BUT...

12:39.715 --> 12:42.457
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW

12:42.544 --> 12:45.590
THAT MY HUSBAND WAS NOT
THIS RED JOHN PERSON.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.725
HE WAS...

12:49.812 --> 12:52.032
THE KINDEST...

12:52.119 --> 12:54.774
GENTLEST SOUL YOU CAN IMAGINE,

12:54.861 --> 12:55.775
AND...

12:55.862 --> 12:59.909
I DON'T KNOW HOW...

12:59.996 --> 13:04.914
BUT YOUR COLLEAGUE MADE
A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.699
IS IT POSSIBLE YOUR HUSBAND
HID THINGS FROM YOU?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.266
OTHER ASPECTS OF HIS LIFE?

13:09.353 --> 13:12.182
WE WERE VERY CLOSE.

13:12.269 --> 13:15.011
WE DIDN'T KEEP SECRETS
FROM EACH OTHER, EVER.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.796
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

13:16.883 --> 13:19.015
EXCUSE ME?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.625
I MEAN, A SECRET,
BY DEFINITION,

13:20.712 --> 13:22.497
IS SOMETHING
YOU DON'T KNOW, RIGHT?

13:26.066 --> 13:27.371
HOW LONG WERE YOU MARRIED?

13:29.069 --> 13:32.289
THREE YEARS THIS FRIDAY.

13:32.376 --> 13:36.163
HE WAS AT THAT MALL,
BUYING AN ANNIVERSARY GIFT.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.643
SO HE WAS THE PERFECT MAN.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.689
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

13:42.865 --> 13:47.609
[voice breaking]
HE IS A GOOD MAN.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.437
WAS.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.396
ONLY LAST MONTH,

13:52.483 --> 13:55.008
HE GOT AN OFFICIAL COMMENDATION
FROM THE SHERIFF.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.357
FOR WHAT?

13:56.444 --> 13:59.403
WHEN DEBBI LUBIN WENT MISSING,

13:59.490 --> 14:02.145
TIM ORGANIZED
THE VOLUNTEER SEARCH PARTIES.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.581
WHO'S DEBBI LUBIN?

14:03.668 --> 14:08.195
OH, UM,
A GIRL FROM OUR CHURCH.

14:08.282 --> 14:11.198
SHE WENT MISSING ABOUT...
[sniffles]

14:11.285 --> 14:15.724
SIX WEEKS AGO. POOR THING.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.857
ONLY 17.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.815
[Van Pelt]
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.643
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE SEEMED SINCERE.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.166
HOUSE IS CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.212
HE MUST HAVE KEPT A HIDEOUT
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.996
[scoffs]
I THINK SHE'S FULL OF IT.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.607
YEAH, YOU MADE THAT PLAIN.
LISTEN, GRACE,

14:29.694 --> 14:33.002
YOU NEED TO SIGN UP FOR YOUR
COUNSELING SESSIONS A.S.A.P.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.265
[scoffs] SESSIONS? WITH
THE SHRINK? I DON'T NEED IT.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.006
WELL, I THINK YOU DO.

14:37.093 --> 14:40.792
BESIDES, IT'S NOT YOUR CALL.
IT'S MANDATORY AFTER A SHOOTING.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.056
THEY SAY A PSYCH COUNSELING
SHEET IN YOUR FILE

14:43.143 --> 14:44.535
DOESN'T MATTER, BUT IT DOES.

14:44.622 --> 14:48.409
GRACE, I'M ASKING YOU
AS A FRIEND. GET HELP.

14:48.496 --> 14:51.325
SEE THE SHRINK.
TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.066
DON'T LET THIS
EAT AWAY AT YOU.

14:54.806 --> 14:58.898
I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN,
REALLY. THANK YOU.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.815
LISTEN, WE'VE GOT
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.600
WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO A MUFFIN.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.863
TIMOTHY CARTER
LOOKS INNOCENT.

15:07.950 --> 15:11.258
HIS WIFE MAKES A GOOD CASE
FOR HIM. HIS HOUSE WAS CLEAN.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.912
YOU SEARCH THE WHOLE PLACE?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.870
WE DIDN'T RIP OUT
THE FLOORBOARDS.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.654
SURE, HE COULD HAVE
BEEN HIDING SOMETHING,

15:16.741 --> 15:18.134
BUT WITHOUT ANY CLUES,

15:18.221 --> 15:20.571
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START LOOKING.

15:20.658 --> 15:23.009
WHAT'S CARTER'S STORY?
WHERE'S HE FROM?

15:23.096 --> 15:25.620
ONLY CHILD OF MISSIONARIES,
GREW UP IN AFRICA,

15:25.707 --> 15:27.187
STUDIED AND LIVED ABROAD

15:27.274 --> 15:29.972
UNTIL HE MOVED TO THE U.S.
TO LIVE IN '06.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.583
SO IN OTHER WORDS,
HE JUST APPEARS ON THE GRID

15:32.670 --> 15:35.238
FIVE YEARS AGO. THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A FAKE IDENTITY.

15:35.325 --> 15:38.589
MAYBE. OR HE'S A GUY WHO MOVED
TO THE COUNTRY FIVE YEARS AGO.

15:38.676 --> 15:41.679
THE ONLY RED FLAG WE HAVE
IS THAT HE RECENTLY PUT HIMSELF

15:41.766 --> 15:44.769
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEARCH FOR
A GIRL WHO'S GONE MISSING.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.510
THAT'S YOUR CLASSIC
ORGANIZED CRIMINAL

15:46.597 --> 15:49.905
PSYCHOPATH BEHAVIOR--INSERTING
HIMSELF INTO AN INVESTIGATION.

15:49.992 --> 15:54.040
AGAIN, MAYBE. OR HE'S A GOOD GUY
WHO WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

15:54.127 --> 15:57.173
WE HAVE NO HARD FACTS,
JUST YOUR WORD.

15:57.260 --> 16:00.872
AND YOU'RE BEGINNING TO THINK
THAT MAYBE MY WORD IS DUBIOUS.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.223
MAYBE I'M CRAZY.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.616
MAYBE I SHOT SOME RANDOM GUY.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.314
NO.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.058
IT'S CROSSED MY MIND, YEAH.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.276
FAIR ENOUGH.

16:15.322 --> 16:18.325
GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET OUT
TO HELP YOU WITH THIS.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.632
HOW? YOUR BAIL'S SET
AT A MILLION BUCKS.YEAH, THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.896
ONCE I GET THE MONEY,
I'LL CALL YOU.HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.115
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.943
MEANTIME, I NEED YOU
TO GET AHOLD

16:28.030 --> 16:30.641
OF TIMOTHY CARTER'S
PERSONAL EFFECTS FROM FORENSICS.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.426
HOW AM I GONNA DO THAT?

16:32.513 --> 16:34.732
YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.822
[screaming]

16:37.909 --> 16:41.087
JANE SAYS THE GUN
WAS IN THE NEWSPAPER.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.871
[keys tap]

16:42.958 --> 16:43.915
[Cho] THERE.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.091
LOOKS LIKE A WAITRESS.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.831
CAN'T SEE
IF SHE TAKES ANYTHING.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.703
[keys tap]

16:48.790 --> 16:50.357
SECURITY GUARD.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.272
[tap]

16:52.359 --> 16:56.102
[Rigsby]
AND THAT'S THE FORENSIC TECH.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.494
NO GUN.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.322
ONE OF THOSE THREE
MUST'VE TAKEN IT--

16:59.409 --> 17:00.976
WAITRESS, SECURITY GUARD,
FORENSIC TECH.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.499
YEAH, IF THERE WASA GUN.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.720
[Rigsby] YEAH.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.288
[indistinct conversations]

17:10.812 --> 17:13.032
[man speaking indistinctly over P.A.]

17:22.911 --> 17:25.392
I LOVE A GOOD GAME OF CARDS.
WHAT'S THE BUY-IN?

17:25.479 --> 17:27.611
BUY-IN'S 100 GRAND,
OUTSIDE MONEY.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.309
EXCELLENT. I'M IN.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.788
YOU GOT TO HAVE COLLATERAL,

17:30.875 --> 17:32.834
SO WE KNOW
YOU CAN COVER YOUR DEBTS.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.879
NO PROBLEM.
I GOT ALL SORTS OF COLLATERAL.

17:34.966 --> 17:38.709
I HAVE A VINTAGE CAR COLLECTION
WORTH 2 1/2 MIL OR THEREABOUTS.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.276
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT?

17:40.363 --> 17:43.018
WELL, WHAT KIND OF FOOL
WOULD LIE TO FOLKS LIKE YOU

17:43.105 --> 17:44.889
ABOUT SOMETHIN' LIKE THAT?

17:44.976 --> 17:48.806
IF YOU FOUND OUT I WAS LYING,
YOU'D KILL ME, RIGHT?

17:48.893 --> 17:50.765
TRUE. TAKE A SEAT.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.419
THANK YOU.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.770
[clears throat]

17:55.857 --> 17:57.728
I WAS THE FIRST TECH
ON SCENE.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.992
SPOKE TO THE DETECTIVES
FROM SAC P.D.YOU KNOW.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.733
THERE'S MULTIPLE INVESTIGATIONS
GOING ON HERE.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.562
OH, SURE. BUT AREN'T
YOU GUYS SUSPENDED?

18:05.649 --> 18:07.956
TECHNICALLY, YEAH,
BUT WE'RE JUST TALKING HERE.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.915
I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD BE...
TALKING TO YOU.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.787
WHY NOT? YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO HIDE?

18:12.874 --> 18:15.398
NO. WHAT WOULD I BE HIDING?

18:15.485 --> 18:17.096
LOOK.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.186
SOMEONE TOOK A CELL PHONE
AND A GUN FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.797
NOT ME. THERE WAS NO GUN,
NOT THAT I SAW.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.190
WAIT.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.976
LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME THAT.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.631
THERE WAS NO GUN.

18:34.591 --> 18:37.551
[indistinct conversations]

18:39.466 --> 18:41.032
25.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.558
[whistles]

18:48.301 --> 18:53.001
OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA SEE YOU,
AND THEN I WILL RAISE YOU...

18:58.267 --> 18:59.790
ALL IN.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.840
[clears throat]

19:07.711 --> 19:10.975
YOU KNOW, PUSS...

19:11.062 --> 19:15.806
WHEN YOU BLUFF,
YOU HAVE A REAL OBVIOUS TELL.

19:15.893 --> 19:18.548
WHEN I REACH TO TUG ON MY EAR,
BUT STOP MYSELF?

19:18.635 --> 19:20.681
YEAH.

19:20.768 --> 19:25.773
OH. OHH, BAM. STRAIGHT FLUSH.
HE GOT YOU GOOD.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.515
[laughs]

19:28.602 --> 19:29.994
[snorts]

19:32.475 --> 19:34.477
[tires screech]

19:50.667 --> 19:52.321
TERESA LISBON?

19:52.408 --> 19:55.411
YES?

19:55.498 --> 19:59.894
PHIL SAYS TO TELL YOUR FRIEND HE
DOESN'T WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.566
HI.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.263
HEY.

20:25.659 --> 20:28.705
SO WHAT DID YOU DO,
HONESTLY?

20:28.792 --> 20:30.229
HE HAD A GUN.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.840
NO, I MEAN, HOW DID YOU
RAISE THE BAIL MONEY?

20:32.927 --> 20:35.495
OH, THAT.
UH, MURDER FOR HIRE.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.671
KILLED A SNITCH.
STABBED HIM IN THE KIDNEYS.

20:37.758 --> 20:38.889
YOU DID NOT.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.456
I DID NOT.

20:40.543 --> 20:44.155
I WON IT IN A CARD GAME,
BUT I HAD YOU FOR A MOMENT.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.375
YOU REALLY DO
FEAR FOR MY SANITY.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.638
NO. WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

20:48.725 --> 20:51.989
WELL, FIRST, EGGS.
THEN WE GO SEE SALLY CARTER.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.253
DID YOU GET HER HUSBAND'S
EFFECTS FROM FORENSICS?

20:54.340 --> 20:56.472
YES. I HAD TO LIE
THROUGH MY TEETH,

20:56.559 --> 20:59.519
CALL IN ALL KINDS OF FAVORS,
AND IT WAS A BUST.

20:59.606 --> 21:02.826
NOTHING USEFUL.
WATCH, KEY, GUM, WEDDING RING.

21:02.913 --> 21:06.090
DOESN'T MATTER. GETS US
IN THE ROOM WITH SALLY CARTER.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.354
I DON'T THINK SHE'S GONNA
WANNA TALK TO YOU.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.529
REALLY?

21:09.616 --> 21:11.226
YOU KILLED HER HUSBAND.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.446
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
THE ICE IS BROKEN.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.796
WE HAVE SOMETHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.808
NO, HE DIDN'T HAVE A GUN,
NOT THAT I SAW.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.289
DID YOU NOTICE THE NEWSPAPER
THAT HE WAS CARRYING?

21:30.376 --> 21:32.465
NO. I DIDN'T REALLY
SEE ANYTHING.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.945
I WAS TRYING TO
COMFORT HIM THE BEST I COULD.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.078
SO HE WAS STILL ALIVE.

21:37.165 --> 21:38.775
YES.DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

21:38.862 --> 21:42.562
HE SAID, "GIVE MY LOVE
TO SALLY AND CHARLAINE."

21:42.649 --> 21:43.650
THAT'S ALL?

21:43.737 --> 21:45.129
THEN HE DIED.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.175
I THINK, ANYHOW.
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE,

21:47.262 --> 21:49.438
AND THE SECURITY GUARD
WAS FREAKING OUT AT ME,

21:49.525 --> 21:50.831
SO I LEFT HIM.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.441
WHY WAS THE GUARD
FREAKING OUT?

21:52.528 --> 21:55.314
HE WAS LIKE,
"GET AWAY FROM THE BODY!

21:55.401 --> 21:57.272
THIS IS EVIDENCE!
DON'T TOUCH HIM!"

21:57.359 --> 21:59.361
HE WAS KIND OF
A JERK ABOUT IT.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.450
THIS GUARD--
HE WAS A YOUNGISH BALD GUY?

22:01.537 --> 22:04.540
YES, WITH CRAZY EYES.

22:04.627 --> 22:07.021
[man] YEAH, RON DEUTSCH.

22:07.108 --> 22:10.590
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING
TODAY, BUT HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.287
I NEED HIS HOME ADDRESS.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.072
[sighs]

22:17.118 --> 22:19.468
[types on keyboard]

22:25.387 --> 22:27.215
[doorbell rings]

22:27.302 --> 22:29.260
I HAVE A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.438
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN SHOT. YOU'RE
BOUND TO HAVE A GLOOMY OUTLOOK.

22:32.525 --> 22:33.743
IGNORE YOUR FEELINGS.

22:37.486 --> 22:40.010
I'M SORRY, AGENTS.
THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.273
WE'RE HAVING
A SMALL MEMORIAL PARTY FOR TIM.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.145
WE HAVE
HIS PERSONAL EFFECTS HERE.

22:44.232 --> 22:45.886
THANK YOU.
I CAN TAKE THOSE.

22:45.973 --> 22:48.932
I'M SORRY. MRS. CARTER HAS TO
SIGN FOR THEM IN OUR PRESENCE.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.325
SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

22:50.412 --> 22:54.547
I SEE. UH, LET'S GO AROUND
TO THE KITCHEN DOOR.

22:54.634 --> 22:57.027
OKAY, THEN.

22:57.114 --> 22:58.681
GOT TO GO.

22:58.768 --> 22:59.943
[cell phone shuts]

23:00.030 --> 23:02.642
[indistinct conversations]

23:02.729 --> 23:04.295
WELL, THIS IS EASY AS PIE.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.993
SO FAR.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.429
PIE.

23:07.516 --> 23:08.865
[door opens]

23:10.127 --> 23:11.955
OH. BUT YOU'RE--

23:12.042 --> 23:13.957
[door closes]YES, I AM.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.698
SALLY, YOU ALRIGHT?

23:15.785 --> 23:17.134
THIS...

23:17.221 --> 23:21.269
THIS IS PATRICK JANE,
THE MAN WHO SHOT TIM.

23:21.356 --> 23:22.836
[whispers] OH, MY LORD.

23:22.923 --> 23:26.013
DON'T BE SCARED.
I'M HARMLESS, TRULY.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.841
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

23:27.928 --> 23:31.018
I HAD TO TALK TO YOU
FACE-TO-FACE,

23:31.105 --> 23:34.674
SO I'D KNOW FOR SURE.

23:34.761 --> 23:37.198
IF YOUR HUSBAND'S INNOCENT,
IF I MADE A MISTAKE,

23:37.285 --> 23:41.115
THEN I'M TRULY, DEEPLY SORRY,

23:41.202 --> 23:42.856
AND I SWEAR TO YOU,

23:42.943 --> 23:46.076
I WILL SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE
EARNING YOUR FORGIVENESS.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.651
MR. JANE...

23:55.738 --> 23:57.697
AS GOD IS MY WITNESS,

23:57.784 --> 24:01.048
MY HUSBAND NEVER
BROKE THE LAW IN HIS LIFE.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.267
YOU MURDERED A GOOD MAN.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.801
DO YOU HAVE ANY TEA?

24:19.675 --> 24:20.894
[knocks on door]

24:20.981 --> 24:23.157
MR. DEUTSCH!

24:26.465 --> 24:27.596
OPEN IT UP.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.251
YOU GOT A WARRANT?

24:30.338 --> 24:33.036
WE DON'T NEED ONE. WE JUST
WANT A QUICK LOOK AROUND.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.647
LET ME CHECK WITH MY BOSS.

24:34.734 --> 24:35.952
SIR...

24:36.039 --> 24:38.607
WON'T BE LONG.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.435
YOU HEAR THAT?WHAT?

24:40.522 --> 24:42.742
SOUND OF A STRUGGLE, COMING
FROM INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

24:42.829 --> 24:45.005
OH, YEAH. I DO.
SOMEONE MIGHT BE IN DANGER.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.833
YEAH. [grunts]

25:14.251 --> 25:17.080
[Rigsby] HEY. SECURITY GUARD'S
DEAD. HAIR DRYER IN THE BATHTUB.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.429
COULD IT BE AN ACCIDENT?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.127
Well, it could be.

25:20.214 --> 25:21.998
EXCEPT THE DEAD GUY'S BALD,
NEAR ENOUGH,

25:22.085 --> 25:24.305
SO WHAT WOULD HE USE
A HAIR DRYER FOR?

25:24.392 --> 25:26.046
LOOKS LIKE SUICIDE OR MURDER.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.613
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.224
NOT FOR MR. DEUTSCH,
GOD REST HIM,

25:30.311 --> 25:31.442
BUT SUPPORTS JANE'S STORY.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.009
Yeah.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.316
SOMEONE MUST'VE ARRANGED
FOR DEUTSCH TO TAKE THE GUN,

25:35.403 --> 25:37.579
SWITCH THE PHONE,
KILLED HIM TO KEEP HIM QUIET.

25:37.666 --> 25:38.928
Be sure that forensics

25:39.015 --> 25:40.626
SEARCH DEUTSCH'S
APARTMENT CAREFULLY.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.149
IT'S A LONG SHOT,

25:42.236 --> 25:45.282
BUT WE MAY GET LUCKY
AND FIND THE GUN OR THE PHONE.

25:45.369 --> 25:48.808
IT'S WEIRD HOW MUCH WE HAD
IN COMMON RIGHT FROM THE START.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.158
WE JUST NATURALLY
MADE A COUPLE.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.029
SOUL MATES.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.031
YES. SOUL MATES.

25:55.118 --> 25:56.990
[knocks]JANE.

25:57.077 --> 26:00.341
OH. [whispers]
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE, SALLY.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.865
[lowered voice] THE FIRST
SECURITY GUARD ON THE SCENE

26:02.952 --> 26:06.913
AFTER THE SHOOTING, IS DEAD--
HAIR-DRYER-IN-THE-BATHTUB DEAD.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.045
WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF.
I MEAN...

26:09.132 --> 26:10.612
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

26:10.699 --> 26:14.442
THIS WOMAN IS GOOD.
STARTING TO DOUBT MY OWN STORY.

26:14.529 --> 26:15.704
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

26:17.532 --> 26:18.620
[clears throat]

26:18.707 --> 26:20.187
[sips] MM.

26:20.274 --> 26:23.190
SALLY, WOULD YOU MIND
IF I USED YOUR BATHROOM?

26:23.277 --> 26:25.496
NOT AT ALL.THANK YOU.

26:49.216 --> 26:52.088
THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL WE NEED.
WE'LL LEAVE YOU IN PEACE.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.177
UH, IN JUST ONE MOMENT.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.790
SEE, THING IS, SALLY,
I LIKE YOU.

26:57.877 --> 27:00.140
I CAN TELL THAT YOU'RE
A GOOD, HONEST PERSON,

27:00.227 --> 27:01.881
WHICH MEANS EITHER I'M CRAZY

27:01.968 --> 27:05.319
OR YOUR HUSBAND WAS KEEPING
SOME VERY DARK SECRETS FROM YOU,

27:05.406 --> 27:07.538
AND I-I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M NOT CRAZY.

27:07.626 --> 27:11.281
MY HUSBAND KEPT
NO SECRETS FROM ME. NONE.

27:11.368 --> 27:14.545
ALL MEN KEEP SECRETS
FROM THEIR WIVES--ALL OF THEM.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.895
TIM WAS NO DIFFERENT.

27:15.982 --> 27:16.939
YOU'RE WRONG.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.594
I BET I CAN PROVE I'M RIGHT.

27:19.681 --> 27:20.987
YOU RECOGNIZE THESE?

27:21.074 --> 27:23.163
YES, OF COURSE--
TIM'S KEY RING.

27:23.250 --> 27:26.122
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN KEYS CLOSE BY?

27:28.777 --> 27:30.474
HOW MANY KEYS
DO YOU HAVE THERE?

27:30.561 --> 27:31.954
UH, SIX.

27:32.041 --> 27:32.999
YOU SURE?

27:34.522 --> 27:37.090
SIX KEYS.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.658
HUH.
YOUR HUSBAND HAS SEVEN.

27:39.745 --> 27:44.967
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.622
WHAT'S THE SEVENTH KEY FOR?

27:47.709 --> 27:49.058
I DON'T KNOW.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.494
YOU DON'T FIND THAT ODD?

27:51.887 --> 27:53.933
NO. I'M SURE LOTS
OF HUSBANDS AND WIVES

27:54.020 --> 27:55.499
HAVE A DIFFERENT
NUMBER OF KEYS.

27:55.586 --> 27:58.111
EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

27:58.198 --> 28:00.200
EVERYBODY HAS SECRETS.

28:00.287 --> 28:04.465
THIS IS PROOF POSITIVE THAT
YOUR HUSBAND WAS NO DIFFERENT.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.249
I WONDER WHAT IT OPENS.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.252
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART

28:09.339 --> 28:11.080
WITH THESE LITTLE
MIND GAMES, DON'T YOU?

28:11.167 --> 28:12.473
IT'S JUST A QUESTION.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.388
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

28:14.475 --> 28:18.914
YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A SAD,
CRAZY PERSON, AND A MURDERER.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.524
AND I'M SORRY,

28:20.611 --> 28:23.353
BUT I WANT YOU TO LEAVE
MY HOUSE RIGHT THIS MINUTE.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.528
OKAY.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.022
I DON'T GET WHAT YOU THOUGHT
WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.807
I WAS FEELING MY WAY.

28:41.894 --> 28:44.157
[sighs] WHAT NOW?

28:44.244 --> 28:45.724
WELL, JUST DRIVE
AROUND THE BLOCK.

28:45.811 --> 28:46.855
OKAY.

28:46.942 --> 28:49.031
WHY?

28:49.118 --> 28:50.990
QUESTION...

28:51.077 --> 28:52.643
DO YOU TRUST ME?

28:53.993 --> 28:56.735
NOT 100%, NO.

28:56.822 --> 28:59.650
DIFFERENT QUESTION, THEN.
OH. COULD YOU STOP RIGHT HERE?

28:59.738 --> 29:00.739
[seat belt clicks][sighs]

29:03.263 --> 29:06.527
[groans][car alert beeps]

29:06.614 --> 29:08.398
SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION?[groans]

29:10.009 --> 29:11.140
HOW'S YOUR INJURY?

29:11.227 --> 29:12.228
IT HURTS.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.927
MM. YOU THINK YOU CAN RUN?NO.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.233
YEAH. PROBABLY DON'T
WANT TO GET TOO EXCITED.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.887
YOU'LL POP YOUR STITCHES.WHAT?

29:18.974 --> 29:20.671
I'M GONNA SNEAK
INSIDE THE CARTER HOUSE.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.586
STAY HERE
UNTIL I CALL YOU.DON'T--

29:22.673 --> 29:24.675
DON'T YOU DARE--JANE?

29:24.763 --> 29:25.938
JANE!

29:26.025 --> 29:27.200
[sighs]

29:46.959 --> 29:48.308
[thud]

29:58.274 --> 30:01.843
[indistinct conversations]

30:25.432 --> 30:27.129
[Sally]
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
GOODNIGHT.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.305
[Joan] GOODNIGHT.

30:29.392 --> 30:32.308
IF YOU NEED ME TO STAY OVER,
KEEP YOU COMPANY...

30:32.395 --> 30:34.006
I CAN BABYSIT CHARLAINE.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.050
I'LL BE FINE.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.443
ANYTHING YOU NEED.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.097
THANK YOU, HONEY.
YOU'VE BEEN A ROCK.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.141
[kiss]

30:39.228 --> 30:40.577
CALL ME, OKAY?I WILL.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.623
ALRIGHT. GOODNIGHT.

30:42.710 --> 30:43.885
[creak]

30:43.972 --> 30:45.713
[door closes]

30:45.800 --> 30:47.715
[footsteps approach]

31:11.260 --> 31:12.827
[keys jangle]

31:15.395 --> 31:16.483
[switch clicks]

31:56.958 --> 31:58.481
[keys jangle]

32:32.037 --> 32:35.040
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?

32:35.127 --> 32:37.390
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

32:41.002 --> 32:44.919
DON'T YOU EVER LOOK AT ME.

32:51.404 --> 32:52.883
[sighs]

32:55.625 --> 32:57.236
[drawer closes]

33:00.543 --> 33:03.329
YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

33:06.071 --> 33:07.986
YOU KNOW.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.688
[whispers]
WHAT DOES THIS OPEN?

33:14.775 --> 33:16.559
[sniffles]

33:16.646 --> 33:20.520
SHH. OH, DEBBI.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.392
OPEN YOUR EYES.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.003
LOOK AT IT.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.442
WHAT DOES THIS OPEN?

33:31.139 --> 33:33.489
[voice breaking]
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:33.576 --> 33:36.449
YOU LYING SLUT![slap]

33:36.536 --> 33:39.843
YOU AND TIM HAVE BEEN KEEPING
SECRETS FROM ME ALL ALONG,

33:39.930 --> 33:42.324
HAVEN'T YOU? ALL ALONG!

33:42.411 --> 33:44.022
WHAT DOES THIS OPEN?!

33:45.719 --> 33:48.417
IT OPENS MY LOCKER
AT THE CBI GYM.

33:50.506 --> 33:53.683
GOOD NEWS IS, YOUR HUSBAND
WASN'T HIDING ANYTHING FROM YOU.

33:53.770 --> 33:57.209
YOU REALLY WERE SOUL MATES.

33:57.296 --> 33:58.993
BAD NEWS?

33:59.080 --> 34:01.822
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST,
YOU LOONY BITCH.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.085
[Lisbon] OH, MY GOD.

34:04.172 --> 34:08.176
ON YOUR KNEES.
PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

34:08.263 --> 34:09.656
[keys clatter]

34:11.875 --> 34:14.530
LISTEN, THIS GIRL IN
THE BASEMENT CHANGES THE GAME.

34:14.617 --> 34:16.358
WE CAN'T APPEAR VINDICTIVE.

34:16.445 --> 34:19.187
JANE HAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
OF PUBLIC SYMPATHY RIGHT NOW.

34:19.274 --> 34:22.756
YEAH, WELL, THE D.A. IS TELLING
ME TO GO FULL SPEED AT HIM.

34:22.843 --> 34:24.366
VIGILANTE JUSTICE
CAN'T GO UNPUNISHED,

34:24.453 --> 34:26.673
REGARDLESS WHAT THE SYMPATHETIC
CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT BE.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.370
OH, NO, ABSOLUTELY.

34:28.457 --> 34:31.417
A FIRM LINE DRAWN UNDER THIS
EPISODE IS BEST FOR THE BUREAU.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.333
IT WAS BEST FOR ALL CONCERNED.
I'M JUST SAYING...

34:34.420 --> 34:36.422
NO DEATH PENALTY, RIGHT?

34:36.509 --> 34:37.727
NO, THAT'S OUT NOW,

34:37.814 --> 34:39.468
BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT
FIRST DEGREE MURDER

34:39.555 --> 34:40.904
WILL STAND UP.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.993
FACTS DON'T ALLOW
FOR ANY OTHER VERDICT.

34:43.081 --> 34:48.216
AFTER A WHILE,
I STOPPED TRYING TO ESCAPE.

34:48.303 --> 34:51.524
THEN I THOUGHT
ABOUT KILLING MYSELF.

34:51.611 --> 34:54.614
BUT THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT
MY MOM AND DAD AND MY BROTHER,

34:54.701 --> 34:57.356
AND I COULDN'T DO IT.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.880
I HAD TO STAY ALIVE FOR THEM,

34:59.967 --> 35:04.014
SO THAT KEPT A SPARK OF HOPE
ALIVE INSIDE ME.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.843
AND THEN, JUST WHEN
I WAS ABOUT TO DESPAIR,

35:06.930 --> 35:09.411
MR. JANE AND AGENT LISBON
CAME AND RESCUED ME.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.980
YOU'RE A BRAVE GIRL, DEBBI.

35:14.851 --> 35:17.637
NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD TIME
TO LOOK BACK CALMLY,

35:17.724 --> 35:19.943
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION
OF TIMOTHY CARTER?

35:21.423 --> 35:23.599
HE'S A MONSTER.

35:26.646 --> 35:29.562
THANK YOU.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.041
THANK YOU,MR. JANE.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.958
MR. ARDILES?

35:41.835 --> 35:43.141
DEBBI, JUST ONE QUESTION.

35:45.055 --> 35:49.103
DID TIMOTHY CARTER EVER SAY
TO YOU THAT HE WAS RED JOHN?

35:49.190 --> 35:50.539
NO, SIR.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.541
DID HE EVER MENTION
THE NAME RED JOHN?

35:52.628 --> 35:54.761
NO, SIR.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.590
DID HE EVER MENTION ANY OTHER
CRIMES HE MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED?

35:57.677 --> 36:00.984
NO, BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT--THANK YOU SO MUCH, DEBBI.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.595
YOU'VE BEEN SUPER HELPFUL.

36:02.682 --> 36:05.772
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.426
REDIRECT, MR. JANE?

36:07.513 --> 36:08.862
[mouths word]

36:08.949 --> 36:12.735
THE WITNESS MAY STEP DOWN.
THANK YOU, DEBBI.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.177
MR. ARDILES?

36:22.963 --> 36:25.618
NOW MR. JANE

36:25.705 --> 36:27.924
IS GOING TO STAND UP HERE
IN A MOMENT,

36:28.011 --> 36:30.013
AND HE'S GOING TO TELL YOU

36:30.100 --> 36:32.929
THAT TIMOTHY CARTER
WAS RED JOHN.

36:34.931 --> 36:38.631
THE FACT IS, HE HAS NO PROOF
OF THAT--NONE WHATSOEVER.

36:38.718 --> 36:42.678
NOW WAS, UH, WAS TIM CARTER
A NICE MAN? NO.

36:42.765 --> 36:43.810
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.335
BUT WAS HE A SERIAL KILLER?

36:47.422 --> 36:49.859
DO WE HAVE ANY PROOF
THAT HE EVER KILLED ANYONE?

36:49.946 --> 36:52.340
ANYONE AT ALL? NO. WE DON'T.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.168
THE ONLY MURDER THAT WE KNOW OF,

36:54.255 --> 36:56.431
THE ONLY MURDER
THAT IS AN ATTESTED FACT,

36:56.518 --> 37:00.261
IS THE MURDER COMMITTED
BY THIS MAN HERE, PATRICK JANE--

37:00.348 --> 37:02.089
A MURDER COMMITTED

37:02.176 --> 37:05.614
OUT OF MISGUIDED LUST
FOR PERSONAL VENGEANCE.

37:09.444 --> 37:12.273
PROSECUTOR SAYS THAT
TIMOTHY CARTER WASN'T RED JOHN.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.363
WELL, CARTER TOLD ME HIMSELF
THAT HE WASRED JOHN,

37:15.450 --> 37:19.062
BUT I-I CAN'T PROVE THAT.

37:19.149 --> 37:23.589
THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE
IS INCONCLUSIVE.

37:23.676 --> 37:26.679
HIS WIFE REFUSES
TO TALK TO ANYONE,

37:26.766 --> 37:30.857
REFUSES TO SPEAK AT ALL,
SO SHE'S NO USE TO US.

37:30.944 --> 37:33.294
WHAT ABOUT CARTER'S RECORDS?

37:33.381 --> 37:38.168
SURELY THERE MUST BE
SOME CLUES THERE--NO.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.735
ON PAPER,

37:39.822 --> 37:44.131
THIS MAN SEEMS TO APPEAR
OUT OF NOWHERE FIVE YEARS AGO.

37:44.218 --> 37:46.699
BEFORE THAT, NOTHING.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.178
WHY?

37:49.919 --> 37:52.531
BECAUSE TIMOTHY CARTER

37:52.618 --> 37:58.232
IS AN INVENTED IDENTITY, A MASK.

37:58.319 --> 38:01.235
I'M NOT GUILTY
OF KILLING TIMOTHY CARTER

38:01.322 --> 38:04.717
BECAUSE TIMOTHY CARTER
NEVER EXISTED.

38:04.804 --> 38:08.982
THERE IS NO TIMOTHY CARTER.
THERE IS ONLY RED JOHN.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.770
RED JOHN...

38:14.857 --> 38:18.644
STARTED KILLING PEOPLE
12 YEARS AGO.

38:18.731 --> 38:22.648
IT'S HARD TO PUT AN EXACT NUMBER
ON HOW MANY PEOPLE HE'S KILLED,

38:22.735 --> 38:27.348
BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND 28--

38:27.435 --> 38:31.570
NEARLY ALL WOMEN,
LATE AT NIGHT, IN THEIR HOMES.

38:31.657 --> 38:33.311
HE WAKES THEM FIRST,

38:33.398 --> 38:37.271
BECAUSE HE LIKES TO SEE
THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES.

38:37.358 --> 38:41.188
HE LIKES TO HEAR THEM BEG
FOR MERCY AS HE CUTS THEM OPEN.

38:43.669 --> 38:47.542
HE DID THAT
TO MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER...

38:47.629 --> 38:52.112
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR HIM EVER SINCE...

38:52.199 --> 38:54.810
LOOKING FOR PERSONAL VENGEANCE.

38:57.247 --> 39:01.643
I BELIEVE THAT'S... MY RIGHT.

39:01.730 --> 39:06.126
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KILL THE MAN
THAT KILLED MY FAMILY.

39:06.213 --> 39:09.303
I DON'T SAY I SHOULDN'T BE
PUNISHED FOR DOING WHAT I DID.

39:09.390 --> 39:13.176
I FEEL I HAD NO CHOICE.

39:21.228 --> 39:23.491
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

39:38.550 --> 39:41.379
[Van Pelt] ANY NEWS?

39:41.466 --> 39:43.119
THE JURY'S OUT.

39:43.206 --> 39:44.817
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

39:44.904 --> 39:49.256
MAYBE IF WE'RE LUCKY, HE'LL
GIVE HIM SECOND-DEGREE MURDER.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.998
JANE WILL BE OUT OF PRISON
IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.479
[buzzer]

39:54.566 --> 39:59.484
THE JURY'S BACK ALREADY.
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.137
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,

40:01.224 --> 40:03.357
HAVE YOU REACHED
A UNANIMOUS VERDICT?

40:03.444 --> 40:05.751
WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

40:08.231 --> 40:11.626
PLEASE STATE YOUR VERDICT
FOR THE COURTROOM.

40:18.198 --> 40:21.506
WE, THE JURY, FIND
THE DEFENDANT, PATRICK JANE...

40:25.205 --> 40:27.250
NOT GUILTY, ON ALL COUNTS.

40:27.337 --> 40:30.210
[gallery murmuring]

40:34.997 --> 40:36.259
[gavel bangs]

40:36.346 --> 40:38.479
QUIET!

40:38.566 --> 40:40.220
[murmuring continues]

41:13.471 --> 41:16.648
SO... WHAT NOW?

41:16.735 --> 41:18.780
NOW?

41:18.867 --> 41:22.262
WELL,
TEA WOULD HIT THE SPOT.

41:22.349 --> 41:24.699
NO. I MEAN, WHAT NOW?

41:24.786 --> 41:27.267
WELL, YOU'VE DONE WHAT
YOU SET OUT TO DO.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.617
YOU GOT YOUR VENGEANCE.

41:29.704 --> 41:33.360
DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENT?
FEEL BETTER?

41:33.447 --> 41:35.797
NO. I FEEL GUILTY.

41:35.884 --> 41:37.233
GUILTY? WHY?

41:37.320 --> 41:39.932
FOR DECEIVING THE JURY.
I MEAN, I HAD NO CHOICE.

41:40.019 --> 41:41.237
GOING TO PRISON FOR MURDER

41:41.324 --> 41:44.110
WOULD HAVE BEEN
A VICTORY FOR RED JOHN.

41:44.197 --> 41:46.678
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
RED JOHN'S DEAD.

41:46.765 --> 41:48.375
TIMOTHY CARTER'S DEAD.

41:48.462 --> 41:50.943
HE WAS AN EVIL MAN,
BUT HE WASN'T RED JOHN.

41:51.030 --> 41:53.075
RED JOHN...

41:53.162 --> 41:54.686
IS STILL ALIVE.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.603
WATCH THE ROAD.
