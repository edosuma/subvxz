00:01.688 --> 00:03.951
That's when Detective
Johnson realized that

00:03.976 --> 00:06.398
Fuad couldn't be the Cook County Killer.

00:06.491 --> 00:07.781
There's no chance a man

00:07.806 --> 00:09.562
with such severe rheumatoid arthritis

00:09.587 --> 00:11.937
could have used a hacksaw to
cut through the women's necks.

00:12.250 --> 00:15.853
So, who did murder Magdaline
and the six other women?

00:15.919 --> 00:18.723
And how long will
Chicagoland live in terror?

00:19.226 --> 00:20.525
Thanks for joining us

00:20.590 --> 00:22.459
for this installment of "Victim."

00:22.526 --> 00:23.781
I'm Rachel Schwartz.

00:23.844 --> 00:27.581
Special thanks to WBEZ Chicago
and our sponsor, MailChimp.

00:28.078 --> 00:30.875
When are they gonna
catch this guy, right?

00:31.781 --> 00:34.250
So... so he's still out there?

00:34.317 --> 00:36.250
Yes, Robby, but don't worry.

00:36.317 --> 00:37.986
He only kills girls.

00:48.070 --> 00:50.666
Oh, there you are.

00:50.732 --> 00:52.901
You're over two hours late.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.070
I was worried you might've
gotten in an accident

00:55.137 --> 00:57.140
hit your head, and were
suffering from amnesia.

00:57.205 --> 01:00.076
Then I'd have to remind you who
I am for the next six months.

01:00.142 --> 01:01.609
No, sorry.

01:01.677 --> 01:03.913
I got a call to rescue a stray dog.

01:03.978 --> 01:05.613
But you didn't have your rescue stuff.

01:05.681 --> 01:08.250
Oh, um, you know, uh,

01:08.317 --> 01:11.720
I didn't need it. It was a small dog.

01:11.787 --> 01:13.455
- Okay.
- Hey.

01:13.522 --> 01:14.790
I hate to do this,

01:14.856 --> 01:16.624
but I'm gonna need
a rain check on tonight.

01:16.692 --> 01:18.928
- I am exhausted.
- Oh, that's okay.

01:18.994 --> 01:21.297
We can just hang out
tomorrow night at dinner.

01:22.797 --> 01:24.570
Actually, can we reschedule that too?

01:24.667 --> 01:25.775
Why?

01:25.800 --> 01:28.936
I, um, you know, I forgot that

01:29.003 --> 01:31.773
I signed up to volunteer
at the children's hospital.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.208
Well, I guess it would be selfish of me

01:34.276 --> 01:35.878
to ask you to cancel that.

01:35.945 --> 01:38.679
I mean, unless the kids
aren't that sick.

01:40.296 --> 01:41.616
They're pretty sick though, right?

01:41.683 --> 01:43.453
Yeah, I know they are.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.821
But if you show up and
all the kids are gone,

01:45.887 --> 01:47.589
you can just give me a call...

01:47.657 --> 01:50.426
oh, gone because
they've been discharged,

01:50.493 --> 01:52.179
not gone because they...

01:54.496 --> 01:55.750
Okie-dokie.

01:56.162 --> 01:57.710
I guess that's my cue.

02:03.197 --> 02:04.492
Good night.

02:13.748 --> 02:15.883
That little turd, Shane Coop,

02:15.950 --> 02:19.654
just told me I look like
I ate Paul Blart, Mall Cop.

02:19.722 --> 02:22.123
God, I hate the dirtbag family.

02:22.190 --> 02:23.592
Who's the dirtbag family?

02:23.658 --> 02:25.226
Can't believe you don't know
who the dirtbags are.

02:25.294 --> 02:28.063
How can you tell? It's a public school.

02:28.129 --> 02:30.665
Every school has one.
There's at least eight of them.

02:30.732 --> 02:32.168
They all look the same.

02:32.234 --> 02:34.702
They're always greasy from
working on their mini bikes,

02:34.770 --> 02:38.106
and every year, one of them
brings fireworks to school.

02:38.174 --> 02:39.540
At Fillmore, it's the Coops.

02:39.607 --> 02:41.176
Artie Coop's in my class...

02:41.242 --> 02:43.044
He does bring pork rinds
and a can of Jolt

02:43.111 --> 02:44.380
for lunch every day.

02:44.446 --> 02:45.881
Poor bastards.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.718
They're all doomed to end up
on parole or Maury Povich.

02:48.783 --> 02:51.152
Wait, why? Because they're poor?

02:51.219 --> 02:52.487
No.

02:52.555 --> 02:54.290
I refuse to believe that
these kids are bound

02:54.355 --> 02:56.891
to a certain fate because
of their economic status.

02:56.958 --> 02:59.062
You're such a hypocrite.

02:59.128 --> 03:00.796
You're just saying that
because you're poor now.

03:00.862 --> 03:02.797
That's not true. I care.

03:02.865 --> 03:06.100
If I take them under my wing,
I can turn my life around.

03:06.168 --> 03:07.535
You just said, "my life."

03:07.601 --> 03:09.278
I meant their life.

03:10.404 --> 03:12.309
Lives. Morning, queens.

03:12.334 --> 03:13.551
Hi.

03:22.784 --> 03:24.652
Caroline, how are you
handling the breakup?

03:24.781 --> 03:27.043
Oh, you know, uh,

03:27.689 --> 03:29.357
some days are better than others.

03:29.424 --> 03:31.159
If you ever need someone to talk to,

03:31.225 --> 03:32.426
just know I'm always here.

03:32.493 --> 03:34.669
- Ugh.
- Thanks.

03:35.431 --> 03:38.161
- Is she wearing...
- Tights instead of leggings?

03:38.186 --> 03:39.372
Yes.

03:39.397 --> 03:41.236
I can't believe a grown-ass
woman's still wearing

03:41.302 --> 03:43.938
- day-of-the-week underwear.
- It's actually helpful.

03:44.005 --> 03:46.074
I almost forgot it was Wednesday.

03:48.210 --> 03:50.145
Mary-Louise, did you hear another woman

03:50.212 --> 03:51.512
went missing last night?

03:51.580 --> 03:52.881
They think it was
the Cook County Killer.

03:52.948 --> 03:54.216
Who's the Cook County Killer?

03:54.283 --> 03:56.686
Have you not been listening to "Victim"?

03:56.752 --> 03:58.754
This guy kills women in Thatcher Woods,

03:58.820 --> 04:00.823
takes them to a basement,
which they know because

04:00.890 --> 04:02.525
they found mold spores on the body,

04:02.592 --> 04:04.093
then covers them in lacquer
to preserve them

04:04.158 --> 04:06.160
so he could have sex with their bodies.

04:07.796 --> 04:09.831
But I'm sorry... did you need something?

04:09.898 --> 04:12.755
One second... I have to
wipe my mind and reset.

04:14.292 --> 04:15.301
Okay.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.707
Hot Dad's been acting strange lately.

04:18.773 --> 04:22.610
He came home late last night
and lied about where he was.

04:22.677 --> 04:24.846
And then he canceled dinner tonight.

04:24.913 --> 04:27.882
He lied about where he was last night?

04:28.175 --> 04:29.477
Where was he Sunday night?

04:29.622 --> 04:31.887
- He went for a run.
- The whole night?

04:31.954 --> 04:33.487
What about two weeks ago Tuesday?

04:33.555 --> 04:34.895
Same as every Tuesday...

04:34.920 --> 04:36.659
he drives along the highway
to look for stray animals.

04:36.725 --> 04:38.160
Stray animals,

04:38.227 --> 04:41.130
or single women with
no ties to the community?

04:41.196 --> 04:43.665
What about August 12th,
May 24th, or January 30th?

04:43.732 --> 04:45.067
How should I know?

04:45.132 --> 04:46.902
Those were all the nights
women were abducted.

04:46.968 --> 04:50.786
Mary-Louise, what if Hot Dad
is the Cook County Killer?

04:51.161 --> 04:52.762
I'm serious.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.709
This makes perfect sense.

04:54.776 --> 04:57.412
The only reason Hot Dad's
okay not having sex with you

04:57.478 --> 04:59.180
is because you're still alive.

04:59.247 --> 05:02.149
Oh, that's not true.
He likes being abstinent.

05:02.216 --> 05:04.052
He says it's a lovely challenge.

05:04.119 --> 05:06.621
Wrong! He's gonna lacquer you!

05:06.687 --> 05:07.956
Your boyfriend exhibits

05:08.023 --> 05:09.725
textbook serial killer behavior.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.626
He is smart, charming,
and super good-looking.

05:11.692 --> 05:13.094
I mean, think about it...

05:13.161 --> 05:15.496
Ted Bundy, Richard Ramirez,
the Craigslist killer...

05:15.564 --> 05:17.099
hot, hotter, hottest.

05:17.165 --> 05:18.900
The writing's on the wall, Mary-Louise.

05:19.076 --> 05:20.778
He is the Cook County Killer.

05:20.803 --> 05:23.370
Hey. Forgot my supplies.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.244
She's wearing tights, right?

05:28.310 --> 05:30.723
Yeah. I can see her tootie crack.

05:31.780 --> 05:33.248
- Do you think she knows?
- Oh.

05:33.419 --> 05:36.918
Probably not. Someone should tell her.

05:36.985 --> 05:38.787
Someone totally should,

05:38.853 --> 05:40.656
but I am so busy... busy, busy bee.

05:40.723 --> 05:42.124
Oh, my God. I have so much to do.

05:42.191 --> 05:44.059
Why have I been talking to you?
What was the point?

05:46.864 --> 05:48.528
Cecelia,

05:50.039 --> 05:51.872
your...

05:52.270 --> 05:54.371
bangs...

05:54.603 --> 05:55.870
look really nice.

05:55.937 --> 05:57.973
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.497
You should look at them

06:00.675 --> 06:02.577
in a full-length mirror.

06:02.644 --> 06:04.145
Okay.

06:06.267 --> 06:07.364
Enjoy recess,

06:07.389 --> 06:09.359
and remember what we learned yesterday.

06:09.384 --> 06:11.886
A broken bird's egg is not a treasure.

06:11.953 --> 06:14.890
It's trash. Uh, Artie?

06:14.956 --> 06:16.826
I'm gonna need you to stay in today.

06:16.891 --> 06:18.989
I didn't pee in the garbage can.

06:19.156 --> 06:20.442
Great.

06:21.044 --> 06:22.430
I want you to know that

06:22.497 --> 06:25.033
I see a wealth of
untapped potential in you.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.635
If you and I work together,

06:26.701 --> 06:30.706
we can alter the course of your
life in a very profound way.

06:30.773 --> 06:32.475
- Okay.
- Wonderful.

06:32.540 --> 06:34.208
Let's start with table manners.

06:34.276 --> 06:36.511
Why are there a billion forks?

06:36.578 --> 06:38.013
Thank you for asking.

06:38.079 --> 06:40.615
There's one for every course, Arthur.

06:40.682 --> 06:43.020
- It's Artie.
- Not anymore.

06:43.552 --> 06:46.922
This is a dinner fork.
This is a salad fork.

06:46.987 --> 06:48.757
This is a fish fork,

06:48.824 --> 06:51.393
and this is a spork.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.700
If you see one of these
at a restaurant, leave.

06:55.230 --> 06:57.631
Oh, those are for lobster claws.

06:57.699 --> 07:00.083
To replace them, like a prosthetic?

07:00.575 --> 07:04.825
My uncle's got a fake leg
'cause of the diabetes.

07:05.307 --> 07:07.742
No. No.

07:07.809 --> 07:10.546
These are to crack open a lobster claw.

07:10.612 --> 07:12.715
Man, lobster pinches me,

07:12.781 --> 07:15.082
I'll just bash him with a crowbar.

07:15.149 --> 07:16.784
- Bam!
- Hey, Artie?

07:16.852 --> 07:19.822
I saw some kids beating up
your brother on the playground.

07:19.889 --> 07:22.557
My dad says,
"No one hits Coop but Coop."

07:22.624 --> 07:24.460
- I'm out of here.
- Oh, wait!

07:24.526 --> 07:26.961
You weren't excused. Arthur?

07:27.028 --> 07:28.997
You trying to "My Fair Lady" this kid

07:29.064 --> 07:31.366
is the saddest thing I've ever seen,

07:31.432 --> 07:33.769
and I once saw
Rob Schneider do stand-up.

07:33.836 --> 07:35.302
We're making a lot of progress.

07:35.369 --> 07:37.439
I know you're having
a hard time with your breakup,

07:37.506 --> 07:40.176
but isn't there something else
you can busy yourself with,

07:40.242 --> 07:42.043
like whittling yourself a dildo?

07:42.110 --> 07:45.280
- I don't whittle my dildos.
- So you do have a dildo?

07:45.583 --> 07:46.911
This has nothing to do with Toby.

07:46.936 --> 07:48.004
Fine.

07:48.029 --> 07:49.985
But even if you do get through to Artie,

07:50.050 --> 07:51.653
there's still seven more garbage kids

07:51.720 --> 07:53.689
to pull him back into the vortex.

07:53.756 --> 07:55.224
Henry Higgins.

07:55.290 --> 07:57.926
Just you wait. I'll reform them all.

07:59.627 --> 08:01.528
♪ Knock, knock ♪

08:02.631 --> 08:05.267
Sweetie, are you home?

08:05.333 --> 08:06.634
Honey?

08:06.701 --> 08:08.403
I just popped by to bring you

08:08.470 --> 08:11.640
some surprise
I-love-you cookies because...

08:11.706 --> 08:14.348
♪ Surprise, I love you ♪

08:22.180 --> 08:24.614
Don't go in the basement!

08:28.356 --> 08:29.981
Sorry, babe.

08:30.759 --> 08:32.293
The light doesn't work down there.

08:33.894 --> 08:37.011
Didn't want you to
fall and hurt yourself.

08:43.613 --> 08:46.114
Beautiful bisque play, Dusty!

08:46.302 --> 08:48.505
Croquet is the sport
of the upper class...

08:48.573 --> 08:50.007
you don't sweat,

08:50.073 --> 08:52.872
and you can do it while
holding an Arnold Palmer.

08:54.044 --> 08:55.779
Can we go home now?

08:55.845 --> 08:57.411
No. I don't wanna be alone.

08:57.848 --> 08:59.784
Uh, I mean,

08:59.849 --> 09:01.622
we haven't worked on our postures yet.

09:01.681 --> 09:02.948
Books.

09:06.357 --> 09:08.858
Remember, ears over your shoulders,

09:08.926 --> 09:10.194
shoulders relaxed,

09:10.261 --> 09:12.496
and always look down
at people from your nose

09:12.562 --> 09:13.964
ever so slightly.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.099
It helps others remember their place.

09:16.166 --> 09:19.070
Single file. Nice and organized.

09:19.136 --> 09:21.098
Crystal May, you're doing great.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.440
They'll be back to selling flowers

09:23.507 --> 09:26.208
at Covent Garden by the end of the week.

09:30.781 --> 09:32.315
Are you sure he's not home?

09:32.382 --> 09:34.151
This is so stupid.

09:34.218 --> 09:36.286
I can't believe you talked me into this.

09:36.354 --> 09:38.689
I should've never told you
he raised his voice.

09:38.754 --> 09:42.225
And Pastor Ted always says,
"Thou shalt not snoop."

09:42.292 --> 09:44.427
It's basically the 11th commandment.

09:44.494 --> 09:46.397
Do you know what the
12th commandment should be?

09:46.464 --> 09:49.967
Thou shall not kill.
Ever heard of that one, Jesus?

09:50.033 --> 09:52.134
He's hiding something, Mary-Louise,

09:52.201 --> 09:53.703
and it's probably
multiple murder victims.

09:53.770 --> 09:56.340
Well, being here without
him knowing feels wrong.

09:56.406 --> 09:58.075
Do you think Clarice Starling
felt guilty about

09:58.142 --> 10:00.378
snooping around
Buffalo Bill's kill lair?

10:00.444 --> 10:01.812
He's not a killer.

10:01.878 --> 10:04.581
I'm just doing this to
prove to you he's innocent.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.483
It's locked.

10:06.550 --> 10:08.152
Oh, my God.

10:08.219 --> 10:10.454
This is getting juicy.

10:10.521 --> 10:12.455
There's gotta be a key
around here somewhere.

10:12.522 --> 10:15.258
Chelsea, be careful.
You're making a mess.

10:15.325 --> 10:17.928
Ugh, my God. He won't even notice.

10:17.994 --> 10:20.763
He's too busy getting up
in some lacquered puss.

10:20.830 --> 10:22.599
Please don't say, "puss."

10:22.666 --> 10:24.402
They haven't found the
latest missing girl yet.

10:24.468 --> 10:26.170
She's probably down there
in a soundproof room,

10:26.235 --> 10:28.838
dirty, naked, and eating baked beans.

10:28.906 --> 10:30.174
Why baked beans?

10:30.240 --> 10:32.231
Because that's all he gives her.

10:35.089 --> 10:37.184
Mary-Louise, look.

10:38.161 --> 10:39.463
Kill trophies.

10:39.528 --> 10:41.764
They're probably just
leftover from Sharon.

10:41.830 --> 10:43.133
Oh, really?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.964
Because the initials
on this locket are "L.K."

10:45.989 --> 10:48.550
So unless Sharon's
real name is LaSharon,

10:48.575 --> 10:51.374
this locket belongs to missing
27-year-old dental hygienist,

10:51.441 --> 10:52.973
Lauren Klubshire.

10:55.224 --> 10:56.725
Be on the lookout for a red hoodie.

10:56.792 --> 11:00.095
The woman who just went missing
was last seen wearing one.

11:05.238 --> 11:08.041
Oh, my God.

11:08.437 --> 11:10.906
He's pulling women's teeth out
and jerking off to them.

11:10.972 --> 11:13.442
How could you know that?

11:13.509 --> 11:15.387
We have gotta get in this basement.

11:17.712 --> 11:19.809
Ugh, got it...

11:26.020 --> 11:27.731
Lacquer.

11:30.592 --> 11:32.562
Hey, Deb, you just missed
a great yoga club.

11:32.628 --> 11:34.229
You're wearing tights, you idiot.

11:34.296 --> 11:36.766
- These are leggings.
- No, they're tights.

11:36.832 --> 11:39.568
I can see your bush coming out
the side of your underwear.

11:39.634 --> 11:42.205
The little curls make
your crotch look like a rabbi.

11:42.272 --> 11:44.773
Oh, so that's why
there were so many boys

11:44.840 --> 11:46.520
in yoga club today.

11:54.883 --> 11:57.019
I told you. He said the light's broken.

11:57.086 --> 12:00.355
- And you believed him?
- Find a light switch.

12:00.422 --> 12:01.990
Oh. I think I got something.

12:02.057 --> 12:03.725
Mary-Louise, get off me.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.194
I'm just looking for the light.

12:05.260 --> 12:07.329
Really? Because you just
cupped my breast.

12:07.397 --> 12:09.131
Maybe it's lower on the wall.

12:09.156 --> 12:11.739
That's my ass! Oh, my God, Mary-Louise!

12:11.933 --> 12:13.466
Got it.

12:14.370 --> 12:16.471
Oopsies.

12:16.538 --> 12:19.240
I guess those weren't light switches.

12:21.977 --> 12:23.978
Is that... blood?

12:27.216 --> 12:29.051
Oh, my God. I was right.

12:29.118 --> 12:30.571
Oh, my God. I was right.

12:30.596 --> 12:32.899
Oh, my God! I was right!

12:33.137 --> 12:35.057
We gotta get out of here!

12:39.161 --> 12:40.696
He's home.

12:40.763 --> 12:42.764
Come on, otherwise
you're not gonna be alive

12:42.831 --> 12:44.133
when you lose your virginity.

12:48.437 --> 12:50.873
It's okay, girl. I got your back.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.841
I won't let anything happen to you.

12:52.908 --> 12:55.551
Thanks, Chelsea. I love you.

12:56.412 --> 12:58.715
- I said, I love you.
- Yeah, I heard you.

13:12.494 --> 13:14.730
Mary-Louise? What are you doing here?

13:16.155 --> 13:17.225
Uh...

13:20.302 --> 13:21.645
Oh...

13:22.428 --> 13:23.755
Oh...

13:26.191 --> 13:27.676
Oh... okay.

13:28.409 --> 13:31.346
I, uh, didn't want you
to have to go out of your way

13:31.413 --> 13:33.182
to pick me up for our dates, so...

13:33.708 --> 13:34.850
Here I am.

13:34.917 --> 13:36.333
Great. You ready to go?

13:36.358 --> 13:39.128
We're gonna be late for dinner.
It's a little cold outside.

13:39.153 --> 13:40.422
You might wanna put on a jacket.

13:40.489 --> 13:41.934
Oh, I... I don't have one.

13:42.184 --> 13:43.403
Here.

13:44.593 --> 13:45.903
You can wear this.

13:51.154 --> 13:53.489
I couldn't be more proud
of you children.

13:53.769 --> 13:56.572
You've come such a long way
from where I found you...

13:56.639 --> 13:58.880
hitting a dead squirrel with a stick.

13:59.307 --> 14:00.576
Together, we're proven that

14:00.643 --> 14:03.079
you can change your station in life.

14:03.145 --> 14:05.980
Thank you, Ms. Watson.

14:06.047 --> 14:07.989
Thank you for thanking me.

14:11.411 --> 14:13.522
You must be Mr. Coop.

14:13.589 --> 14:16.659
Missy Watson, huh?

14:16.725 --> 14:18.326
So you're the one thirsty to show me

14:18.394 --> 14:20.328
what a good ma you could be to my kids.

14:20.395 --> 14:21.896
Yeah, I've been here before, right?

14:21.964 --> 14:24.499
Everybody wants head from nut.
I'll tell you what.

14:24.566 --> 14:26.033
You're gonna have to find somebody else

14:26.100 --> 14:27.437
who's sitting on a fat welfare check,

14:27.503 --> 14:29.606
'cause I'm not gonna be
your human vibrator.

14:29.772 --> 14:31.039
Excuse me?

14:31.105 --> 14:34.242
All right, maybe as
a constellation prize,

14:34.310 --> 14:35.677
sometime I take you
in the back of the van,

14:35.744 --> 14:37.580
give you a quick fingerblast...

14:37.647 --> 14:39.882
Two of them at the same time.
Anyway, Coops, in the van!

14:39.947 --> 14:41.294
Let's go!

14:41.934 --> 14:43.484
Take off those dumbass bows.

14:43.552 --> 14:45.287
You look like a bunch of ice dancers.

14:45.354 --> 14:47.055
Wait, are you mine? Yeah, all right.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.419
Go, go.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.526
Bigger ones, tie the
little ones down to the seats.

14:50.592 --> 14:53.028
You know the routine.
I don't need that ticket again.

14:53.633 --> 14:55.708
All right. Coops ride.

15:01.908 --> 15:04.176
Once a Coop, always a Coop.

15:10.711 --> 15:13.098
This isn't the way to the restaurant.

15:13.801 --> 15:15.750
Yeah, I gotta make a quick stop.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.481
There's a hurt deer in Thatcher Woods.

15:20.251 --> 15:21.801
Thatcher Woods?

15:22.227 --> 15:23.669
Hot serial killer.

15:28.958 --> 15:31.261
Hail Mary, full of Grace,

15:31.327 --> 15:32.929
the Lord is with thee.

15:32.995 --> 15:35.432
Blessed art thou amongst women...

15:42.368 --> 15:43.505
Come on.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.411
This is it.

15:46.176 --> 15:48.812
I'm not gonna eat baked beans
in your basement!

15:52.149 --> 15:53.417
Girl!

15:53.484 --> 15:54.951
- Stop!
- Mary-Louise!

15:55.018 --> 15:56.354
- No!
- Run!

15:56.419 --> 16:00.123
He's the Cook County Killer!
Save yourselves!

16:00.190 --> 16:02.659
Girl! Stop!

16:02.725 --> 16:04.395
We were wrong.

16:06.663 --> 16:07.931
A killer?

16:08.169 --> 16:10.097
Mary-Louise, why would you think that?

16:10.122 --> 16:12.336
The lying and the canceling plans.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.139
And Chelsea and I found
all your kill trophies.

16:15.164 --> 16:16.433
Kill trophies?

16:16.458 --> 16:18.316
The red hoodie and the jar of teeth...

16:18.341 --> 16:20.356
That's one of Blake's old hoodies.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.712
Are you talking about his wisdom teeth?

16:24.059 --> 16:26.783
They pulled them out early
due to his accelerated growth.

16:29.575 --> 16:33.567
What about the locket we
found in that box of jewelry?

16:33.779 --> 16:35.047
"L.K."?

16:35.114 --> 16:37.182
That is my mother's jewelry.

16:37.249 --> 16:39.284
I couldn't bear to donate it
after she passed away,

16:39.351 --> 16:40.645
so I kept it.

16:40.670 --> 16:41.950
Oh, shit.

16:42.574 --> 16:44.008
Oh, no.

16:44.239 --> 16:45.637
I'm so sorry.

16:46.059 --> 16:48.216
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.551
I'm so...

16:50.633 --> 16:51.973
wait.

16:53.739 --> 16:55.833
Why are all of you
out here in the woods?

16:58.489 --> 16:59.872
Well,

17:00.773 --> 17:03.051
this isn't exactly how
I planned for it to go.

17:03.580 --> 17:04.723
But...

17:05.906 --> 17:07.541
You are an idiot.

17:16.888 --> 17:19.925
Mary-Louise,
from the moment that I met you,

17:19.992 --> 17:22.127
I knew that there was
something special about you.

17:22.194 --> 17:25.196
From that first
parent-teacher conference,

17:25.263 --> 17:28.512
I found myself wanting to
spend more time with you.

17:28.591 --> 17:30.360
And every time I did,

17:30.385 --> 17:33.169
I liked you more and more, and...

17:34.106 --> 17:36.630
I fell deeper and deeper
in love with you.

17:37.030 --> 17:39.298
I brought you here because it's...

17:39.323 --> 17:40.745
when we were camping with Blake,

17:40.812 --> 17:44.182
then I realized that you were the one.

17:48.963 --> 17:50.262
Mary-Louise...

17:54.214 --> 17:55.482
Will you marry me?

17:55.628 --> 17:58.419
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:05.356 --> 18:07.067
Congratulations, you two.

18:07.092 --> 18:09.682
Ugh, these idiots didn't tell me

18:09.707 --> 18:11.543
about the engagement until an hour ago.

18:11.610 --> 18:12.864
They said I would blow the surprise...

18:12.889 --> 18:14.690
Oh, crap.

18:15.014 --> 18:16.809
My water just broke.

18:17.396 --> 18:18.958
Someone get some wet wipes.

18:20.162 --> 18:21.697
You're doing great.

18:21.722 --> 18:25.112
As the incomparable Faith Hill
said, "just breathe."

18:25.137 --> 18:27.406
- Caroline, don't ruin this.
- Damien's in Detroit.

18:27.473 --> 18:30.009
He would like permission to
use the Uber app to get here.

18:30.034 --> 18:31.387
- Fine.
- It's a go.

18:31.450 --> 18:32.692
Say hi, girl.

18:32.717 --> 18:35.620
I have 336 people watching you
on Periscope right now.

18:35.645 --> 18:36.913
- What?
- Here.

18:36.938 --> 18:38.407
I found this in the waiting room.

18:38.474 --> 18:39.909
We'll use it to save the afterbirth

18:39.975 --> 18:41.950
so I can make you a nourishing,
post-partum smoothie.

18:41.975 --> 18:43.575
Everybody get out!

18:44.384 --> 18:46.519
- Jeez.
- Okay, fine.

18:46.544 --> 18:48.036
But someone needs to
take off their underwear

18:48.061 --> 18:50.669
and spread their legs 'cause
I am not losing these viewers.

18:54.714 --> 18:56.223
I love her so much.

18:56.658 --> 18:58.760
I just love her so fucking much.

18:58.785 --> 19:00.911
She's so fucking beautiful, isn't she?

19:01.287 --> 19:02.841
She's so fucking perfect.

19:02.866 --> 19:06.136
- She's gorgeous.
- You're a mommy, girl.

19:06.161 --> 19:07.896
We're so proud of you.

19:08.067 --> 19:10.203
Having a baby is one of the most pure,

19:10.228 --> 19:11.821
beautiful things in the universe.

19:11.846 --> 19:14.169
Yeah. It's amazing.

19:14.481 --> 19:18.237
Although, I did tear the skin
between my anus and vagina,

19:18.262 --> 19:21.122
shit the birthing bed,
and now I'm wearing a diaper.

19:27.114 --> 19:29.941
Deb, you didn't tell us
you were coming in today.

19:30.008 --> 19:32.010
I thought we'd surprise you.

19:32.076 --> 19:34.211
Oh, there she is.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.151
Did you decide on a name yet?

19:36.176 --> 19:37.714
We went back and forth for a while

19:37.781 --> 19:39.949
between Kathryn, Kathleen,

19:40.017 --> 19:42.683
Kate, Caitlin, and Katy,

19:42.708 --> 19:45.489
but we finally decided on...

19:45.801 --> 19:46.901
Hagatha.

19:48.856 --> 19:50.194
Like a troll?

19:50.261 --> 19:51.747
It's not a joke.

19:52.731 --> 19:53.964
Oh, my God. That's gorgeous.

19:54.031 --> 19:55.300
- It is.
- It's beautiful.

19:55.367 --> 19:56.934
- An elegant... so elegant.
- Beautiful name.

19:57.001 --> 19:58.269
- Wow.
- Classic.

19:58.336 --> 19:59.804
Do you care if I borrow it?
