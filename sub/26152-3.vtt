15:14.060 --> 15:16.120
-I need a drink. -(chuckles) Tell me about it.

15:16.130 --> 15:17.180
-(both chuckle)

15:19.140 --> 15:20.210
-Shit! -(indistinct shouting)

15:42.120 --> 15:43.140
-There you go, Vic.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.160
-Let's go hunting.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.000
-Where's Charlie?

15:48.010 --> 15:49.200
-He's out the back, having a smoke.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.180
-Charlie!

15:53.230 --> 15:55.060
-Who the hell are you?

15:55.070 --> 15:56.220
-We are the Catalans.

16:01.150 --> 16:03.090
-(Ortega speaking Spanish)

16:09.100 --> 16:11.050
(applause)

16:14.080 --> 16:15.060
-Come on.

16:18.090 --> 16:19.230
Wait, isn't that the mayor?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.160
-It looks like him.

16:21.170 --> 16:23.000
-Go, go, go, go, go.

16:23.010 --> 16:24.230
-Lo siento.   -Perdona. Perdona.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.040
-Man:  Por favor.   -Perdona.

16:26.050 --> 16:27.120
-Lo siento.   -Perdona.

16:28.130 --> 16:29.220
-Esta bien, esta bien.  -Man:  Si, senor.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.160
-Mr. Mayor Ortega. -Woman:  Senor...

16:32.170 --> 16:34.090
-Woman:  Senor--   -Por favor, por favor.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.170
-We're tourists and we're in big trouble. Can you help us?

16:36.180 --> 16:38.010
-What kind of trouble,  senoritas?

16:38.020 --> 16:39.050
-Lily and Lotti: Uh...

16:39.210 --> 16:41.010
-Man:  Mierda.

16:44.150 --> 16:46.070
-(hip-hop music playing) -(rapping in Spanish)

16:50.190 --> 16:51.200
-(beeps)

16:53.220 --> 16:56.050
-You don't look like the rest of the guys on Blanco's payroll.

16:56.060 --> 16:58.090
-That's because I'm not on Blanco's payroll.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.170
-Who do you work for, then?

16:59.180 --> 17:00.230
-You ask too many questions.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.200
-What can I say, I don't like to work in the dark.

17:02.210 --> 17:04.020
(grunts) -(tires screeching)

17:05.230 --> 17:07.000
-(both grunt)

17:09.100 --> 17:10.120
-I'm freelance.

17:14.210 --> 17:16.210
-So what is this job for Blanco?

17:16.220 --> 17:18.220
-We just have to run a little obstruction.

17:18.230 --> 17:20.050
Shouldn't be a problem.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.190
-Piece of cake, right?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.210
-What does it mean?

17:22.220 --> 17:24.110
-It's easy. It's easy.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.090
-Easy.

17:26.030 --> 17:27.010
Si.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.010
As  uno, dos, tres.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.080
-(engine revving) -(tires screech)

17:33.080 --> 17:34.150
-Vic, if-if you're alive,

17:34.160 --> 17:36.180
and I hope to God you are, and believe it or not,

17:36.190 --> 17:38.000
Lotti and I are all right.

17:38.010 --> 17:39.170
We escaped and...

17:39.180 --> 17:41.210
right into the hands of the bloody mayor, as a matter of fact,

17:41.220 --> 17:42.210
and, uh...

17:42.220 --> 17:44.010
Vic, I...

17:46.230 --> 17:48.010
(sighs)

17:48.020 --> 17:49.080
Pick up your bloody phone, will you?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.160
-(cell phone vibrating)

17:51.170 --> 17:55.000
-Somebody's very keen to contact you.

17:55.010 --> 17:56.100
-I'm a popular guy.

17:59.030 --> 18:00.120
Our friend here seems very upset.

18:00.130 --> 18:02.150
What exactly did you do to him, Hate 'Em?

18:02.160 --> 18:04.080
-Nothing out of the ordinary, Vic.

18:04.090 --> 18:07.110
-Your friend tried to cook me in the belly of a brazen bull.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.000
-Right. Got it.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.180
-We have to be extremely careful, Lotti.

18:18.190 --> 18:21.160
To state the obvious, it would be a very bad idea

18:21.170 --> 18:23.040
for the mayor to find out who we are.

18:23.050 --> 18:25.010
-Thank you for your patience, ladies.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.140
Were you able to reach your friends?

18:27.160 --> 18:30.150
-Uh, no, there was no answer.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.150
-I see.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.010
Well, I'm sure they will turn up.

18:37.110 --> 18:39.180
In the meantime, would you be willing to tell me

18:39.190 --> 18:41.010
what has happened to you?

18:41.020 --> 18:42.010
-Oh.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.150
-It is clear that you've both been through somewhat of an ordeal.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.170
As mayor of San Toledo, I'd like to ensure

18:47.180 --> 18:51.050
the situation is resolved and your safety guaranteed.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.130
♪ ♪

19:03.120 --> 19:05.130
-You know how to use it? -In a pinch.

19:16.150 --> 19:17.210
So what's the cargo?

19:17.220 --> 19:19.100
-I'm gonna give you a clue.

19:19.110 --> 19:22.090
We are 40 kilometers from the coast of Morocco,

19:22.100 --> 19:24.210
and I'm pretty sure it's not Berber rugs.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.030
-That's two clues.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.010
-So how we gonna play this?

19:31.020 --> 19:33.230
-When they finish loading the truck, we're taking it.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.040
If you have to shoot, aim straight.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.150
-You're not gonna back me up?

19:38.150 --> 19:41.070
-I told you, I'm the driver.

19:49.170 --> 19:50.200
-Ayudame.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.230
-Hola.

19:59.000 --> 19:59.220
-(grunts)

20:00.090 --> 20:01.130
-(truck engine starts)

20:22.000 --> 20:23.020
-Now...

20:24.060 --> 20:27.210
you are going to tell me where our money is.

20:27.220 --> 20:30.010
-We really don't know where your money is.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.150
-You are lying.

20:33.060 --> 20:35.050
-I-I usually find it best to tell the truth

20:35.060 --> 20:37.000
when sharp knives are involved.

20:41.110 --> 20:42.090
-Raul: Adolfo.

20:47.060 --> 20:48.100
-Do you know what these are?

20:48.110 --> 20:51.100
-Call me an idiot, but they look a lot like red peppers.

20:51.110 --> 20:52.170
-(laughs)

20:52.180 --> 20:56.020
-The rocoto red ghost pepper.

20:58.010 --> 21:01.020
It's... such a delicacy in my hometown,

21:01.130 --> 21:03.220
but you gotta be careful...

21:08.070 --> 21:09.150
because the juice...

21:19.170 --> 21:23.120
-And, uh, what's with the paper cut, then? Hmm?

21:23.130 --> 21:25.060
-(laughing) -Is that all you've got?

21:28.010 --> 21:29.090
You'll have to do better than that.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.180
-(laughter)

21:33.230 --> 21:34.230
-(groans)

21:36.160 --> 21:38.000
(groans) -(laughing)

21:38.010 --> 21:39.020
-Whoa!

21:39.110 --> 21:40.180
Shit!

21:42.020 --> 21:43.050
(moans)

21:43.060 --> 21:44.040
Vic.

21:44.050 --> 21:45.130
-What's the matter, Hate 'Em?

21:45.140 --> 21:48.070
-(groaning) -(laughter continues)

21:53.030 --> 21:54.080
-(Hate 'Em screaming)

21:56.090 --> 21:57.090
-Gracias.

21:59.010 --> 22:01.150
-So you were carjacked just outside of town,

22:01.160 --> 22:05.170
then kidnapped by these unknown assailants?

22:06.090 --> 22:07.130
-Yes, we were, um,

22:08.130 --> 22:11.130
blindfolded and thrown in the back of a truck, and, um,

22:12.120 --> 22:14.090
we were locked in a cell for two days.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.090
-Do you have any idea why you were taken?

22:19.130 --> 22:21.030
Did they ask for a ransom?

22:21.150 --> 22:22.190
-They-they never said.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.040
We were terrified.

22:25.150 --> 22:28.050
-We managed to get out in the end,

22:28.060 --> 22:30.210
get out of the cell, steal one of the cars, and escape.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.160
-Lotti: Luckily we ran into you.

22:34.110 --> 22:35.180
I don't know what would've happened

22:35.190 --> 22:37.110
if you weren't here, Mayor Ortega.

22:39.110 --> 22:40.190
-What a way to start a holiday.

22:40.190 --> 22:41.170
-(Lotti and Ortega chuckle)

22:42.080 --> 22:43.100
-I understand.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.160
-(laughs) -(clears throat)

22:46.090 --> 22:48.000
-I'm so sorry for your troubles.

22:48.210 --> 22:50.210
San Toledo is my town,

22:52.000 --> 22:53.060
and I love it.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.220
There is a sickness here,

22:57.090 --> 22:58.200
a plague of crime.

22:59.090 --> 23:02.140
As a boy, I saw that plague claim many lives, too many.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.120
-That's terrible. -Hmm.

23:06.050 --> 23:08.030
That's the reason why I became mayor,

23:08.200 --> 23:10.180
to rid my home of this cancer.

23:14.050 --> 23:15.190
-(Lotti clears throat) -Don't worry.

23:15.190 --> 23:18.060
We'll get you back to your son very soon.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.000
Until then, I'll take you somewhere safe.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.010
Until we catch these assailants,

23:25.110 --> 23:26.220
it's best to be cautious.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.040
-Thank you.

23:28.050 --> 23:29.130
-Gracias muchas.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.080
Gracias.

23:33.090 --> 23:34.080
-Tomas.

23:34.090 --> 23:35.080
-Tomas:  Si, senor.

23:35.090 --> 23:37.030
-We are taking these ladies to my home.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.130
They will need clean clothes and a shower.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.000
-Lotti: Are you sure this is a good idea?

23:42.010 --> 23:44.130
If he contacts the British Embassy, we're all screwed.

23:44.140 --> 23:47.030
-It's better than taking our chances with Blanco's cops.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.120
One play at a time, Lotti.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.090
-Senoras,  please follow me. -Hmm.

24:10.180 --> 24:13.080
-You did well, all by yourself.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.230
-Let's just say it's not my first rodeo.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.060
-Hmm.

24:17.070 --> 24:18.210
-Now take me back to my bar.

24:24.190 --> 24:28.130
-(Hate 'Em groaning) -Where is our money?

24:28.140 --> 24:31.070
-We don't have your fucking money!

24:31.220 --> 24:33.200
-We gave it to the Romanians, okay?

24:33.210 --> 24:35.020
So I suggest you ask them.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.040
I'll be more than happy to accompany you.

24:37.130 --> 24:41.040
-If you don't get my money in five minutes,

24:41.050 --> 24:45.040
I am going to start killing your friends.

24:46.060 --> 24:49.010
And you, my brave man,

24:49.210 --> 24:52.160
you are going to choose the order.

25:07.050 --> 25:08.080
-Where do you think you're going?

25:08.090 --> 25:09.180
-I'm thirsty. This is a bar.

25:09.190 --> 25:10.230
-We-we're closed.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.130
Go and drink somewhere else.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.020
-You always this much of a dick?

25:15.150 --> 25:17.140
-With people holding my mother hostage, yeah.

25:17.150 --> 25:19.080
-Blanco has your mother?

25:19.210 --> 25:21.050
-Do you think I'm doing this for fun?

25:23.020 --> 25:25.130
-Blanco has a blunt way of ensuring obedience.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.050
-Really?

25:27.060 --> 25:29.100
So what's he got on you? How does he ensure your obedience?

25:30.050 --> 25:32.200
-I told you, I don't work for Blanco.

25:33.220 --> 25:36.040
-Oh, that's right. I remember now. You're freelance.

25:37.180 --> 25:38.170
Hmm.

25:40.110 --> 25:41.220
You ain't gonna get a drink standing there

25:41.230 --> 25:43.020
like a scarecrow, are you?

25:46.140 --> 25:47.140
-Funny.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.140
What kind of beer do you have?

25:55.040 --> 25:56.040
-Whisky.

25:57.100 --> 26:00.020
-Oh, my favorite kind.

26:03.210 --> 26:04.210
-Cheers.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.220
-Salud.

26:12.220 --> 26:14.100
-You've had your drink now, you can go.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.140
(grunts) -(groans)

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
-(groans)

26:22.190 --> 26:24.000
-Oh, fuck!

26:24.220 --> 26:26.040
Shit.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.110
Jesus, what happened here?

26:33.120 --> 26:35.000
-Quick, untie us. The Catalans came back.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.150
-Don't worry about 'em. They're dead.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.150
-Vic: Are they properly pushing-up-daisies dead?

26:38.160 --> 26:39.200
-I didn't check their pulses, Dad,

26:39.210 --> 26:41.080
but I'm pretty sure they're properly dead.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.060
-Come on. Come here.

26:44.030 --> 26:45.070
(groans)

26:45.080 --> 26:46.190
Did you kill them, Albert?

26:47.130 --> 26:49.080
-No. Ines did.

26:49.090 --> 26:50.200
-(footsteps approaching) -Who's Ines?

26:50.210 --> 26:52.060
-(groaning)

26:53.040 --> 26:54.070
-I am.

26:54.210 --> 26:58.040
-Charlie: Oh, well, thank you, Ines, then.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.030
-I'll meet you outside in a minute.

27:02.010 --> 27:04.040
-Come on, Hate 'Em, wake up. We ain't got time to sleep.

27:04.050 --> 27:06.160
-Oh, no more. No more peppers, Vic. No more.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.050
-(sighs)

27:18.130 --> 27:19.210
-Hey. -Hey.

27:21.050 --> 27:22.220
-I just wanted to say thanks...

27:24.110 --> 27:26.090
for handling the Catalans back there.

27:27.050 --> 27:29.060
-You mean "thank you" for saving your life

27:29.070 --> 27:30.160
and the life of your friends?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.080
-Yeah, but don't get too ahead of yourself.

27:33.090 --> 27:34.170
We're pretty difficult to kill.

27:36.120 --> 27:39.050
-That's a quality that might come in useful in San Toledo.

27:41.000 --> 27:41.230
-(car starts)

27:52.160 --> 27:54.070
-You get the phone in her car? -Of course I did.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.000
Look at the big brains on you, Charlie boy.

27:57.150 --> 27:58.140
Come on, let's go inside.

28:09.110 --> 28:10.120
-Thank you.

28:14.020 --> 28:15.060
-This way, please.

28:15.070 --> 28:16.080
-Lily: Beautiful home.

28:20.090 --> 28:22.080
-Tomas, please show our friends to the guest room.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.180
There's a bathroom to freshen up,

28:24.190 --> 28:26.210
and clean towels are in the cabinet.
