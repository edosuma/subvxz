WEBVTT

00:27.402 --> 00:29.237
God, I haven't been
on a road trip in so long.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.364
-Or eaten Doritos.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.158
Aren't we just always eating Doritos?

00:33.241 --> 00:35.410
Please. Why didn't I do
so many things I wanted?

00:35.493 --> 00:38.204
-Seriously.
-Like, why did I ever not eat bread?

00:38.288 --> 00:40.081
-Why did I ever shave my legs?
-I don't know.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.751
Why didn't I have sex
with everybody constantly?

00:42.834 --> 00:43.877
Herpes.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.212
Why was I so worried about being good?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.338
Well…

00:47.422 --> 00:49.632
-…we are being bad now, baby!
-Mm-hmm.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.551
-'Cause we are on the lam!
-Yeah!

00:51.634 --> 00:54.220
-Is it lam, or is it lamb?
-I don't know.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.848
But since we're outlaws,
I think we should have outlaw names.

00:56.931 --> 00:57.932
Should we?

00:58.016 --> 01:02.353
Yes! I think I should be
Judy Five Fingers.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.022
Uh, what's Judy Five Fingers' thing?

01:04.105 --> 01:06.191
-That she has all of her fingers still.
-Oh.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.319
Like, she's that good.
Like, nobody's taken any of her fingers.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.905
-So stupid!

01:12.822 --> 01:14.032
Oh, shit!

01:14.115 --> 01:15.075
What?

01:15.158 --> 01:17.494
-I'm Bitch Cassidy.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.621
Bitch Cassidy.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.873
And the Sundance Kid.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.208
Oh!

01:23.792 --> 01:25.085
-It's amazing.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.803
So what exactly is our plan?

01:34.886 --> 01:37.514
Um, well, we have three weeks,

01:37.597 --> 01:40.975
which is the length of the clinical trial.

01:41.059 --> 01:44.145
-Right.
-So we are just going to relax.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.022
-Mm-hmm.
-And you are going to drink.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.567
And I'm going to watch,
and then we will rinse and repeat.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.153
Or not rinse.
I say we take showering off the table.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.238
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

01:53.321 --> 01:55.615
-Come on. Who's got the time?

02:01.121 --> 02:03.206
And then, um, what about

02:04.124 --> 02:07.168
after the three weeks? What happens then?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.712
I don't wanna think about that.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.674
So, uh, all I know is that
you're not going back to jail.

02:12.757 --> 02:16.469
They're gonna figure out that I'm not
in San Francisco at some point, right?

02:16.553 --> 02:19.722
Then they're gonna know you're helping me,
and that's aiding and abetting.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.977
Oh, man, my bladder's about to burst.
I gotta pull over.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.562
-Here?
-Yep!

02:25.645 --> 02:27.939
And you can abet me by standing guard,

02:28.022 --> 02:30.733
so people don't see me
trying not to piss on my ankles.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.818
Sure.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.822
Ahh, okay.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.116
-Okay. My turn.

02:38.741 --> 02:39.784
Oh, I gotta go!

02:39.868 --> 02:41.119
Ah!

02:41.202 --> 02:43.580
-Oh!
-Yeah, let it out, girl.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.415
You ladies okay? Flat tire?

02:45.498 --> 02:46.374
Uh, we're fine.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.168
-You sure?
-Yes, I'm fucking sure!

02:50.920 --> 02:53.673
-Oh, shit. Oh, my God, Judy.
-What?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.133
-Judy, I know those guys.
-You do?

02:55.216 --> 02:57.260
Yeah, they were at Agent Moranis' hotel.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.761
Why were you at Glenn's motel?

02:58.845 --> 02:59.929
I think they're FBI.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.141
They're not FBI.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.392
No, we're not.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.769
-Get in the car. Get in the car.
-What? Okay, okay.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.022
-Hey, Judy.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.899
Hi, Stavros.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.317
-Stavros?
-Uh-huh.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.902
-The Greeks?
-Uh-huh.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.195
-Oh, my God.
-Uh-huh.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.738
Where you ladies off to?

03:16.821 --> 03:21.075
Oh, uh, you know,
just a… little girls' weekend.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.952
Bet you can afford a really nice hotel

03:23.036 --> 03:25.663
with the money you stole from Steve
that he stole from us.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.790
-What money?
-Don't play dumb.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.543
We know that you and your girlfriend
have been talking to the FBI.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.753
How do you know that?

03:31.836 --> 03:34.172
Because we had
a little chat with them too.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.924
We know you stashed the money

03:36.007 --> 03:38.009
inside those creepy
little girl paintings, Judy.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.344
So let's cut the shit.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.764
I don't wanna have to use this.
This is my least favorite part of the job.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.807
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no!

03:44.891 --> 03:48.478
-No, it's okay.
-Please don't. Oh, no, no.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.439
-Just shoot me.
-What?

03:51.522 --> 03:53.316
-Yeah, I'm dying anyway.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.359
What?

03:54.442 --> 03:56.653
-I have cancer.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.112
She does.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.031
-It's terminal.
-It is.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.951
-She's having a really hard time with it.
-I am!

04:03.701 --> 04:05.245
I lost both my parents to cancer.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.454
I lost my yaya.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.497
-Aww.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.207
But I'm still gonna need that cash.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.168
Well, I don't have it
because I spent it on my treatment.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.795
Because she doesn't have insurance!

04:13.878 --> 04:16.506
Right. I lost my job,
then I was too late for Obamacare.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.299
-So what am I supposed to do?

04:18.383 --> 04:20.218
I'm sorry
about all of that, but look.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.053
What am I supposed to tell Constantine?

04:22.136 --> 04:24.013
Just tell him that I'm already dead.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.015
-I mean, I will be soon anyway.
-Don't say that!

04:26.099 --> 04:27.600
Well, it's true--

04:27.684 --> 04:29.352
-Oh, my God! Are you okay?
-Ow!

04:29.435 --> 04:31.229
-Shit, I don't know. I don't know.
-Judy!

04:31.312 --> 04:32.522
Oh, my God, I need my medicine.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.607
Okay, will you please
just let her get her medicine?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.109
-Is that allowed?

04:36.192 --> 04:38.069
Of course. Let her have
her fucking medicine.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.113
-What are you doing?
-I got this.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.739
-What's going on?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.908
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.036
Drop your guns and get in the car.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.872
Oh, come on. You are not gonna use that.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.418
-Shit!

04:53.501 --> 04:54.669
Goddamn it!

04:54.752 --> 04:55.795
Oh, fuck!

04:55.878 --> 04:57.630
Do what I fucking said!

04:58.131 --> 04:58.965
Please.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.345
Okay. Okay.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.763
Yep, mm-hmm.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.516
Good boy. Go on. Put it down.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.435
There you go.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.979
That's right. Back it on up, boys.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.314
Back it on up.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.732
Get in!

05:18.318 --> 05:19.652
Thank you!

05:19.736 --> 05:22.322
-Okay, move over. I'm gonna drive.
-What the fuck? What the fuck?

05:27.410 --> 05:29.829
-Holy shit! Holy fucking shit!
-Are you okay?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.748
Yeah, I'm okay, but I'm-- I'm sorry.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.417
Who the fuck are you? Fucking badass!

05:34.500 --> 05:37.837
I know. I mean, I really feel like I came
into my own in the last ten minutes!

05:37.920 --> 05:38.921
You really have.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.509
Oh, my God, were we just almost murdered
by the Greek mafia?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.303
-They're a syndicate, but yes.
-Whatever.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.638
Wait. What were you doing
at Glenn's motel?

05:47.722 --> 05:49.223
I, uh,

05:49.307 --> 05:52.727
was there to tell him
that I am pregnant with Steve's baby.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.270
What? Why?

05:54.354 --> 05:58.358
Because that would explain
why my DNA is slathered all over his body.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.361
It was a great plan until you scuttled it.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.988
-Oh, <i>you</i> were the plan scuttler.
-Oh, please.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.948
I still can't believe you confessed.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.033
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.494
-It was pretty on the nose for me.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.454
-Oh, shit. It's Ben.
-Okay.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.414
-What is the plan there?
-I don't know.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.625
-Well, bit of advice from a dying woman.
-Shut it.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.211
-No, I'm wise, and I'm dying.
-Nope, you're neither.

06:18.294 --> 06:22.215
Yes, and if you ever wanna have
the possibility of a real life with him,

06:22.298 --> 06:24.342
you have to be honest about everything.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.303
You deserve to be happy,
and you and I both know

06:27.387 --> 06:29.597
that that can't happen
if you're living a lie.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.808
But what if I'm living <i>la vida loca</i>?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.434
-You're deflecting.
-I'm scuttling.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.603
-Stop scuttling.
-I can't stop. It's what I do.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.064
-Okay, fu--

06:38.147 --> 06:40.233
-I'll stop!
-What? I'm stopping 'cause we're here.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.442
Oh.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.571
-Welcome, señorita! Hmm?
-Hmm.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.656
So, uh… 

06:46.739 --> 06:49.951
…how long has it been
since anyone's been here?

06:50.034 --> 06:52.161
Because it-- it definitely
has that, uh…

06:52.245 --> 06:54.038
…abandoned, like… 

06:54.122 --> 06:55.415
…mansion musk.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.250
Steve used to come down here all the time.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.044
He loved it here, but you know,
obviously, he hasn't been here--

07:01.504 --> 07:03.339
-Did you see that?
-Yes, I saw that.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.091
-What if someone's here?
-Who'd be here?

07:05.174 --> 07:08.469
-I don't know. Does he Airbnb the place?
-How can he Airbnb the place? He's dead.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.012
-Don't tell them that!
-Sorry!

07:10.096 --> 07:12.557
-I'm turning on the lights.
-No, 'cause then they'll know--

07:12.640 --> 07:15.435
-Oh! Oh! Oh! Fuck you! No, no!

07:15.518 --> 07:17.437
-Oh, Jen, it's a little kitty!
-No!

07:17.520 --> 07:18.980
Okay, that's still not great.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.606
-Hi, baby.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.401
Okay, you know, can we please
get it out of here before it murders us?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.611
I think we're the murderers
in this situation.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.697
Okay, well,
you don't know that cat's backstory.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.783
-Oh, I'm gonna let her out. Come on!
-Get it out. Please get--

07:30.867 --> 07:33.619
-Come on!
-I don't wanna be left-- 

07:33.703 --> 07:36.038
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.291
-There you go!

07:40.251 --> 07:41.252
Come on.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.882
Holy shit!

07:48.551 --> 07:49.927
I can't believe it.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.680
-We're finally on vacation. Ahh!
-We're here!

07:52.763 --> 07:54.474
We're here. You're queer.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.933
-And you're used to it.
-Yep.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.855
Oh, God,
Steve and I were great on vacation.

08:00.938 --> 08:01.898
Hmm.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.984
Most of my good memories with him
are from this place.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.613
You know, Ted and I
would never have sex ever,

08:08.696 --> 08:12.074
but on vacation, it's like Bangtown City.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.743
Yes! Bangtown City!

08:13.826 --> 08:17.455
Seriously, I mean, we could be
at a Holiday Inn on the side of a highway,

08:17.538 --> 08:20.291
and it's like twice in one night.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.709
Oh…

08:21.792 --> 08:23.503
Wow, twice.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.089
-Are you judging?
-No, twice is better than none.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.176
-Okay, well, then, what's a lot?
-A lot is like, I don't know.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.553
-I'd say six.

08:32.637 --> 08:33.596
Low ball four.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.640
-Oh, my God!
-It's not always good.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.808
Our two was, like, not even to completion.

08:39.393 --> 08:42.772
My point is, life should be
a permanent vacation.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.357
It should!

08:46.234 --> 08:47.443
It really should.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.487
Yeah.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.659
-Look at this.
-Hmm.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.369
What a cool shell.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.454
Whoa.

08:59.413 --> 09:01.082
I just had déjà vu.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.625
-You did?
-Yeah.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.168
That's a good sign.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.629
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.382
Déjà vu is just your brain
reminding you to remember.

09:13.928 --> 09:17.139
Am I crazy, or does this look like
the guy from the Counting Crows?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.891
How high are you?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.226
Oh, I'm extremely high.

09:20.768 --> 09:23.771
Looks like an old man's nut sack.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.107
No, it looks like a beautiful garlic.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.650
-Nut sack.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.195
Why did you say that?
I was gonna save it!

09:31.279 --> 09:33.656
What? So you can put it
in your mouth four to six times?

09:38.828 --> 09:41.163
-Come on. You wanna go outside?

09:41.247 --> 09:42.873
-All right.
-Get outta here!

09:45.418 --> 09:48.629
-Oh, so beautiful.
-Ah! Look at that.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.214
Look at the moon!

10:46.520 --> 10:48.939
I think it might be funnier in Spanish.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.733
-Oh, it definitely is.
-Mm-hmm.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.622
-Judy?

11:05.706 --> 11:06.624
Judy?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.420
Don't fucking look at me like that.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.380
Jude?

11:13.923 --> 11:14.757
Judy?

11:16.217 --> 11:17.218
Judy?

11:18.177 --> 11:19.136
Judy!

11:21.931 --> 11:23.599
-Hey!
-I was looking all over for you!

11:23.683 --> 11:26.519
Oh, I took the boat out on the water
to see the sunrise.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.020
-It was beautiful.
-Great.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.898
Next time leave a fucking note
because you scared the shit out of me.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.024
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.568
I'm sorry too. I just--

11:34.652 --> 11:37.863
I'm just cranky.
I didn't sleep at all because

11:38.447 --> 11:41.117
Sundance Kid over here
was kicking me all night, so.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.576
Aww.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.204
You should come out on the water.
It's really relaxing.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.165
-Nah. Not really a boat person.
-So you're more of a no person.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.583
-No.
-No?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.085
-No!

11:51.168 --> 11:52.962
Okay, you know what?
Is that thing even safe?

11:53.045 --> 11:56.215
I think there are life vests in the garage
if that makes you feel any better.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.466
-No.
-You sure?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.593
No means motherfucking no.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.055
Okay, well, we don't have to be
out on the water that long, right?

12:03.139 --> 12:06.600
You know, because, like, I haven't eaten
breakfast really or anything like that.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.812
Well, before we go,
I can make a frittata if you want.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.649
Oh, my God.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.780
Is-- is that a '66 Mustang?

12:20.656 --> 12:21.741
It is.

12:23.701 --> 12:27.329
But, I mean, it's not <i>the</i> Mustang, right?

12:28.831 --> 12:29.832
It is.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.293
I don't understand.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.419
I don't either.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.839
I mean, I found a-- a key

12:37.882 --> 12:39.049
hidden in one of my paintings,

12:39.133 --> 12:41.719
and I couldn't figure out
why Steve put it in there.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.851
I thought you guys… took it apart.

12:49.810 --> 12:50.686
Right?

12:50.770 --> 12:51.771
Oh, we did.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.818
He must have…
put it back together again? I--

13:01.405 --> 13:03.157
I am so sorry, Jen.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.785
I'm so sorry.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.415
That's weird 'cause it's…

13:12.833 --> 13:16.420
It just looks like nothing ever happened.

13:18.881 --> 13:19.882
But it did.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.722
Do you want a golf club?

13:27.598 --> 13:30.309
You know, just bash the shit out of it?

13:30.392 --> 13:31.435
Might feel good.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.689
No.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.944
No, it's-- it's just a car.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.492
It's a really, really nice car.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.036
Yeah, it is.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.081
It's a classic.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.542
But it's okay to hate it.

13:57.753 --> 13:58.963
How could I hate it?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.091
It brought you to me.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.767
Do we still have to go
on the fucking boat?

14:17.314 --> 14:19.066
-Thank you for trying.

14:19.149 --> 14:23.529
Thanks for not making me go out there,
'cause I'm, uh, nauseous enough as it is.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.741
So, didn't know
you were such a-- a boater.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.745
Oh, yeah. I used to go on a catamaran
all the time with my Uncle Paul.

14:31.829 --> 14:35.332
Well, I mean, he wasn't really my uncle.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.419
He was sort of my mom's friend
who she would leave me with sometimes.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.005
-I'm scared of where this story is going.
-No, it's a good story.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.048
Okay, good, 'cause, you know…

14:43.132 --> 14:46.927
Yeah, no, I know.
But Paul was a really nice guy.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.722
We were buds.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.558
He would take me out on the bay,
like, every weekend.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.102
And when I was out on that water,

14:55.185 --> 14:58.314
I was just, like,
the most free I ever felt.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.736
But then him and my mom
got into a fight or something.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.905
-And then I never saw him again.
-Hmm.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.781
Like, literally got in his boat…

15:07.865 --> 15:09.617
…and never came back.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.201
Okay, well, that's shitty.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.245
Mm. I don't know.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.164
Sometimes I like to imagine

15:15.247 --> 15:18.375
that he's still out there somewhere,
sailing free as a bird.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.552
I always did wonder
who he really was though.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.889
Like, maybe he was really your father?

15:33.223 --> 15:34.224
Maybe.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.519
I'll never know.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.273
Whatever.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.067
Yeah.

15:43.984 --> 15:47.404
Well…

15:54.161 --> 15:56.288
We only have a few days left, you know.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.666
I know.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.086
You know, I was-- I was thinking.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.631
What if you died?

16:06.215 --> 16:08.092
Well, I think
that's a bit more than a "what if."

16:08.175 --> 16:12.096
No, no, no. I mean, like,
what if you "died" in the clinical trial?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.264
And then we both just stay here?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.892
You can't stay here.
What about Charlie and Henry?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.018
Oh, no, they can come too.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.313
I'm just saying, you know,
I can do real estate anywhere.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.483
And if we sell our house, we'll have cash.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.735
So you're gonna move down here

16:26.819 --> 16:30.155
and have a baby
and never tell Ben that he has a kid?

16:30.823 --> 16:33.409
-That's your plan?
-Okay, well, it's-- You know, it's a plan.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.996
I haven't really worked out
all the details yet, but yeah.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.041
You can't pretend
your real life doesn't exist.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.042
I'm not!

16:42.126 --> 16:43.210
I'm…

16:43.293 --> 16:47.172
Just this way, we can--
we can be together for--

16:48.340 --> 16:49.925
for the time that we have left.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.969
Mm-mm. No, I don't want that for you,

16:52.052 --> 16:53.429
and I don't want that for the boys.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.346
-Judy, please!
-No.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.432
I don't want it to be
like it was with your mom.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.726
Seeing her suffer.
I won't put you through that.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.353
-I won't put me through that.
-I don't care!

17:01.437 --> 17:02.438
I do!

17:03.313 --> 17:05.065
-You have to go back.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.900
You don't wanna miss Henry's concert.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.319
Yes, I do. Desperately!

17:09.403 --> 17:12.406
-Have you seen that kid dance?

17:14.908 --> 17:17.911
-You have a life in Laguna.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.788
You have a life inside you.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.081
Okay, I don't wanna--

17:21.165 --> 17:23.751
Just let's not-- I can't talk anymore.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.836
-You promise me.

17:28.088 --> 17:32.301
Don't let that baby grow up
without knowing its father.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.720
-Trust me.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.889
-It creates a hole in your heart that--
-Judy.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.022
-No, no.
-It's okay. You're okay.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.330
Okay, I'm-- I'm sorry.
We don't speak Spanish. Um--

18:01.413 --> 18:04.541
No, he said that you have something
called placenta previa,

18:04.625 --> 18:06.543
and that's the cause of the bleeding.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.670
Okay, well, what does that mean?

18:20.140 --> 18:21.266
Oh.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.603
What? What did he say? What did he say?
Is there something wrong with the baby?

18:24.686 --> 18:26.063
He said

18:26.146 --> 18:27.856
she looks really healthy.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.568
<i>-She</i> does?
-She does!

18:37.533 --> 18:40.911
-<i>Sí.</i> We'll definitely follow up. Gracias.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We will.

18:40.994 --> 18:41.870
Gracias.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.333
She's a girl.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.418
She is!

18:48.502 --> 18:50.671
All right, I'm not gonna say
I wasn't hoping for a girl

18:50.754 --> 18:52.923
'cause I don't even know
what I was hoping for.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.301
And I mean, you know how gender
is just so loosey-goosey these days.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.345
-Yeah.
-But damn, was I hoping for a girl.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.097
-Oh, I know. I know. Me too!
-Oh, God.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.641
-It's not like boys aren't fine.
-Oh, they're great.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.353
-But girls are better, obviously!
-The best, obviously!

19:08.313 --> 19:10.023
-Oh, my God!

19:15.362 --> 19:16.446
That was scary.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.741
-Yeah, it was.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.577
I'm fucking starving.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.997
Oh, there is an amazing taquería
right next to the house.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.623
-"Taquería"?
-Yeah.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.543
Are you trying to tell me
that you have been able to speak Spanish

19:29.626 --> 19:30.836
this entire time?

19:30.919 --> 19:32.504
<i>Sí. Claro que sí.</i>

19:32.588 --> 19:34.464
Okay, now you're just showboating.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.300
-Aww.
-Judy.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.759
-Look at that.

19:37.843 --> 19:38.677
My God.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.012
<i>Que preciosa.</i>

19:40.095 --> 19:42.723
-Don't know what that means.
-Mm.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.772
-Mmm!
-Mmm! Mmm!

19:50.856 --> 19:52.316
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

19:53.233 --> 19:57.988
So what you're saying is that
Mexican food is better in Mexico.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.032
-It's a little-known secret.
-Yeah.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.492
It's got a little kick to it,
though, but, yeah.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.870
Ooh.

20:04.953 --> 20:08.248
Speaking of which, we got a mini Rockette
up in here right now.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.791
-She kicking?
-Yeah.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.168
Come on! Come feel me up!

20:14.213 --> 20:15.839
All right, gimme your hand.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.759
Right down. Right there. Just-- just wait.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.093
-I know.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.514
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

20:24.598 --> 20:26.558
Hi! What are you doing in there?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.560
-Being a boss-ass B?

20:28.644 --> 20:32.231
Oh, oh. Oh, God. Something's happening.
Just don't make eye contact, okay?

20:32.314 --> 20:33.857
-Just don't--
-Hola!

20:35.442 --> 20:36.652
What did I just say?

20:38.820 --> 20:41.156
-No, no, gracias.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.702
-Come on.
-What?

20:45.786 --> 20:47.746
-We're gonna dance!
-No!

20:47.829 --> 20:50.832
-God.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.343
-I really hate you.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.315
-Who is it?
-No one.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.900
-Get it!
-No!

21:16.984 --> 21:18.860
-Yes!
-No, because we're dancing! Come on. Oh!

21:18.944 --> 21:21.905
-You are scuttling!
-All right, all right.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.453
<i>You have a collect call…</i>

21:28.537 --> 21:30.163
-I'll accept.
<i>-Connecting now.</i>

21:31.456 --> 21:32.916
-<i>Jen? Hey.</i>
-Hi.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.418
-Hi.
<i>-Hi.</i>

21:34.501 --> 21:37.212
I didn't think you'd pick up.
I've been trying you.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.588
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

21:38.672 --> 21:40.340
I'm just, uh, hanging with Judy,

21:40.424 --> 21:43.260
and we're just eating some dinner.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.554
Well, how are you?

21:45.637 --> 21:48.140
<i>I'm okay. Um, listen, I…</i>

21:48.640 --> 21:51.518
Uh…

21:51.601 --> 21:53.562
I'm pregnant.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.688
<i>What?</i>

21:55.439 --> 21:56.648
Seriously?

21:56.732 --> 21:58.650
-Mm-hmm.
<i>-That's amazing.</i>

21:59.234 --> 22:00.319
Is it okay if I ask,

22:00.944 --> 22:03.322
is it-- is it-- is it mine?

22:03.405 --> 22:04.740
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

22:04.823 --> 22:07.075
It's not
an immaculate conception.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.161
<i>-Jeez.</i>
-Oh, my God!

22:13.915 --> 22:16.043
I'm smiling so big,
I'm definitely gonna get punched.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.255
<i>I actually have some news for you too.</i>

22:22.424 --> 22:24.092
Wait. What?

22:25.969 --> 22:28.221
-Agent Moranis is dead.
-Like, literally dead?

22:28.305 --> 22:30.640
Like, literally murdered
to literal death. Yeah.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.975
-My God!
-I know.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.560
What? How?

22:33.643 --> 22:35.937
Oh, my God, he has a dog!

22:36.021 --> 22:39.483
-I haven't told you the best part yet.
-Okay, a man is dead, but…

22:39.566 --> 22:41.234
They think the Greeks did it.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.944
They think the Greeks killed Glenn?

22:43.028 --> 22:44.529
Yeah. And Steve.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.781
-And Steve?
-Mm-hmm.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.450
-Why do they think that?
-I don't know.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.910
I guess his room was ransacked,

22:49.993 --> 22:52.537
and-- and a bunch
of Steve's case shit was missing.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.872
Look, the point is,

22:55.082 --> 22:56.875
Judy, we both can go back now.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.544
I don't know.
Nick still has my confession.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.756
-Well, we can just scuttle it.
-That I don't think is scuttleable.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.384
Fine, then just tell him
you made it up or something

23:05.467 --> 23:07.219
and that the Greeks
threatened to kill you,

23:07.302 --> 23:09.262
which isn't technically a lie.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.765
Yeah, yeah, I just need
to grab a glass of water.

23:11.848 --> 23:15.727
I think I'm starting to believe
in some, um, higher power shit here.

23:15.811 --> 23:19.439
Because, uh,
the timing is… Oh, yeah.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.025
I'm throwing up as I say it… divine.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.611
-I mean, how could we--

23:24.694 --> 23:27.030
-Oh, my God, Judy!

23:33.995 --> 23:35.414
-Here.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.169
I-- I didn't realize
that you were in so much pain.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.589
I didn't want you to realize.

23:45.298 --> 23:47.134
How long has it been like this?

23:48.218 --> 23:51.888
You know when something starts,
it's like a little pain?

23:52.597 --> 23:55.142
And it's there one day and not the next,

23:55.225 --> 23:57.227
and then it's there more days,

23:57.310 --> 24:00.397
and then you
just kind of learn to live with it?

24:00.480 --> 24:02.482
Well, I don't want you to suffer.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.777
So we will figure it out, okay?
Right when we get back.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.906
I'm not going back.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.326
What? What do you mean?

24:14.453 --> 24:15.454
I'm gonna stay.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.081
Permanent vacation.

24:19.583 --> 24:23.295
No, no, I'm not-- I'm not leaving you.

24:23.378 --> 24:24.921
No, you're not leaving me.

24:27.507 --> 24:28.508
I'm staying.

24:38.602 --> 24:39.686
I guess that's fine.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.689
I mean, it's not that far.

24:42.772 --> 24:44.065
Mm-mm. It really isn't.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.194
I could come see you on weekends.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.029
And I'll visit.

24:49.112 --> 24:51.031
Okay, maybe you can

24:51.781 --> 24:54.910
come up for Henry's concert.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.454
But you don't need
to decide that right now.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.998
It's just-- just think about it, okay?

25:00.081 --> 25:01.458
Okay.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.508
I've had the best time, Jen.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.344
I know. Me too.

25:13.428 --> 25:16.973
You were right.
This place is-- It's beautiful.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.104
No…

25:26.942 --> 25:28.652
I mean, I've had the best time

25:29.444 --> 25:30.362
with you.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.999
Me too.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.589
You filled the hole in my heart.

25:49.673 --> 25:52.425
-Oh, shut up. Eww.

25:55.345 --> 25:58.390
-I didn't mean to make you cry.
-Well, it's too late, sister.

26:03.937 --> 26:04.938
I love you.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.191
I love you too.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.902
So, so much.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.614
You've changed my life. 

26:33.008 --> 26:34.009
Come here, you.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.178
Oh, fuck.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.972
-Well.

26:41.933 --> 26:42.934
-Hey.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.562
-Mm-hmm.
-Do you wanna watch our show?

26:45.645 --> 26:47.063
-Mm-hmm.

26:47.147 --> 26:51.067
I think this was the one
where Tootie makes up a pretend boyfriend.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.238
Fuckin' Tootie.

29:08.121 --> 29:11.624
-I love this song!
-I know you do.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.919
You know, I wasn't sure
you were gonna come back.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.797
-I told you I wasn't gonna leave you.
-I know.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.720
Now, I know why you love this car.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.180
-Right?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.852
I'm so glad it's yours now.

29:32.645 --> 29:33.688
Thank you.

29:49.412 --> 29:52.123
-Are you okay back there, Sammy?

29:52.916 --> 29:55.001
We're gonna be okay.

29:58.421 --> 30:00.006
We're gonna be okay.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.761
Just don't fucking piss in my backseat.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.489
-Hey.
-Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late.

30:24.572 --> 30:26.783
No, no, no.
Hey, you're perfect! Get in here.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.161
Mm!

30:30.245 --> 30:33.915
Also, let's hope you got a scootch
more rhythm than your brother, huh?

30:33.998 --> 30:36.167
-Oh, no. It's that bad?
-No.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.210
-Yeah.
-Okay.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.379
But miracles happen every day, right?

31:29.470 --> 31:31.097
Hi, can I sit down?

31:31.180 --> 31:32.891
I have to sit in the aisle.
I get nauseous.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.101
Okay.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.858
I'm sorry, Mom.

31:42.859 --> 31:43.943
Thanks, baby.

31:48.197 --> 31:50.700
-I'm sorry too, Jen.
Hmm?

31:50.783 --> 31:53.703
I never got particularly close to Jamie.

31:53.786 --> 31:54.913
Judy.

31:54.996 --> 31:58.541
But she was always pleasant enough.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.877
Hmm. Thanks, Lorna.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.646
Hi. Thanks. Sorry.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.773
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.608
-Hi.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.362
Hi.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.116
But what are you do-- How… how did you--

32:32.200 --> 32:34.827
-Good behavior.
-Mm. Yeah, of course.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.915
-Plus, I knew where to find you.
-How?

32:38.998 --> 32:40.625
'Cause Judy sent me an invite.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.668
-What?
-Yeah.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.586
-When?
-Couple of weeks ago.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.213
Is she here?

32:49.425 --> 32:50.635
Yeah.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.512
I think so.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.490
So much has been written
about the nature of loss.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.659
The author Jamie Anderson said that

33:14.742 --> 33:17.203
"Grief, I've learned,
is really just love."

33:17.286 --> 33:19.539
"Grief is just love with no place to go.<i>"</i>

33:20.123 --> 33:21.624
So we come here.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.836
We call this a Grief Circle for a reason.

33:25.461 --> 33:28.965
One of them is that
we are literally sitting in a circle.

33:30.216 --> 33:33.344
But the other
is that grief is a continuum.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.471
It goes on and on.

33:35.555 --> 33:38.558
-And on and on, and--

33:38.641 --> 33:40.685
Okay, okay, we get it.

33:41.894 --> 33:43.855
But it's also important to remember

33:43.938 --> 33:46.566
that with loss comes new beginnings.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.444
And speaking of that,

33:50.069 --> 33:52.363
it looks like
we have some new people here today.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.906
Uh, yeah, we do.

33:54.615 --> 33:58.703
This is my daughter… Joey.

33:58.786 --> 34:00.163
-Aww.
-Hi, Joey!

34:00.246 --> 34:01.622
Hi, Joey!

34:01.706 --> 34:03.708
Oh, Jen, she's so cute.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.835
Why didn't you name her Judy?

34:06.419 --> 34:07.962
'Cause that would be weird, Linda.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.630
Not if you really loved her.

34:09.714 --> 34:13.301
This isn't a Hallmark movie,
Linda, okay?

34:13.384 --> 34:16.345
Joey sounds too much like Judy.
It's confusing.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.264
-I like Joey.
-You're confusing.

34:18.347 --> 34:19.849
Yeah, more confusing.

34:19.932 --> 34:21.934
No, I named her Joey,
because you know what?

34:22.018 --> 34:24.353
-What if she's gender fluid?
-There's that.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.271
<i>Mom, watch!</i>

34:25.354 --> 34:26.731
-Be careful, Boop!

34:27.982 --> 34:29.734
Oh, whoa!

34:29.817 --> 34:33.404
Henry Harding
with a perfect ten cannonball!

34:33.488 --> 34:35.406
It's a classic for a reason, folks!

34:35.490 --> 34:37.575
-He's the cannonball king!
-Whoo!

34:37.658 --> 34:39.160
It wasn't even that big of a splash!

34:39.243 --> 34:41.788
-Oh, not that big of a splash?
-No.

34:41.871 --> 34:42.789
How about this?

34:42.872 --> 34:44.582
-How about that? Oh!

34:44.665 --> 34:46.709
-Oh, you're so dead, man!
-Oh, no!

34:46.793 --> 34:49.003
Wait! No, no. I'm sorry!

34:49.087 --> 34:51.464
Don't wake up, Joey.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.425
-No, baby, no.
-Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

34:56.385 --> 34:58.805
Come on! I'll take you both.

35:00.890 --> 35:04.310
Wait, wait, wait! Time out! Time out.
Time out. Time out. Seriously.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.858
-Get outta here!
-Stop!

35:10.942 --> 35:13.319
You sure you don't wanna get in?
Take a little dipper?

35:13.402 --> 35:14.904
Oh, no, I'm good here.

35:14.987 --> 35:16.781
Well, that works out.
'Cause I'm good here too.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.868
-Oh, she is so out.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.662
-Like a light.
-Oh!

35:22.745 --> 35:24.413
Mama's got the magic touch.

35:27.750 --> 35:28.960
Oh, boy.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.963
-I don't wanna sound like a cheeseball--
-Too late.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.714
Fair.

35:34.757 --> 35:35.675
But you know,

35:36.259 --> 35:39.804
when I lost Steve,
I didn't think I'd ever be happy again.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.557
I guess the feeling
was so heavy, you know.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.474
Mm-hmm.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.853
But when I think about
what my life is now…

35:49.689 --> 35:50.690
What our life is…

35:53.985 --> 35:56.362
It's, like, more than I deserve, you know?

35:56.445 --> 35:59.157
Of course you do. That's dumb.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.534
I've made a lot of dumb mistakes.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.537
Well, I love you anyway.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.455
I love you.

36:06.539 --> 36:07.373
Good.

36:07.456 --> 36:10.376
-Even though you're basically perfect.
-Oh, God, have you met me?

36:11.627 --> 36:12.670
No.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.965
Hi, I'm Ben Wood.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.385
Weird.

36:19.468 --> 36:20.636
What?

36:21.262 --> 36:23.306
I just got déjà vu.

36:23.389 --> 36:24.390
Oh.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.143
You always wonder
what that means when that happens.

36:28.686 --> 36:29.520
It's, um,

36:30.104 --> 36:33.191
your brain reminding you to remember.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.570
That makes sense. I'll remember that.

37:00.259 --> 37:01.135
Ben?

37:01.886 --> 37:02.929
Yeah?

37:04.847 --> 37:06.432
I have to tell you something.
