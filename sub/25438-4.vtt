25:14.387 --> 25:15.847
I didn't mean the wrestling.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.646
I'm okay. I just wasn't ready
for you to see all that.

25:23.063 --> 25:23.897
It felt...

25:24.773 --> 25:27.192
different with you watching.

25:30.820 --> 25:31.696
So, what'd you think?

25:33.823 --> 25:35.033
What did I think?

25:37.369 --> 25:38.286
Okay.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.666
I thought it was...

25:44.167 --> 25:45.544
[chuckles] ...offensive.

25:46.753 --> 25:50.215
I mean, you were right, it was offensive.
Definitely, offensive.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.970
I can't believe you did that.

25:55.971 --> 25:56.888
Wrestling.

25:58.181 --> 26:00.100
I mean, you threw a white girl
across a ring...

26:05.355 --> 26:08.608
When did you get that strong?
I don't think I've ever seen you exercise.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.448
[chuckles]
Chasing your chubby behind around.

26:15.782 --> 26:18.868
Carrying you here and there.
"Mommy, up! Mommy, no walk!"

26:19.494 --> 26:21.454
That's all the exercise I needed.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.916
Did you eat anything before that match?

26:25.834 --> 26:29.087
-Uh, I had a muffin.
-That's not dinner. You--

26:31.256 --> 26:32.382
I'm taking you out.

26:33.633 --> 26:36.177
-Oh?
-It's still parents' weekend.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.471
We got to do something normal.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.349
[Tammé] Okay, look at you!

26:43.727 --> 26:44.894
Thank you.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.064
I'm kinda scared of you now.

26:48.189 --> 26:52.193
You should be. I'm a former champion.
[laughs]

27:21.431 --> 27:23.016
I made a few changes.

27:24.976 --> 27:29.147
So I call you about the bed,
and you sell all the furniture.

27:29.856 --> 27:33.068
Are you crazy? Where's Randy gonna sit?
Where's he gonna eat?

27:33.151 --> 27:34.486
Don't worry about Randy.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.946
I worry about Randy all the time.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.116
I think about how he's gonna feel
having two houses.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.745
I was trying to get my place ready
so it felt more familiar for him.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.623
[sighs] Oh.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.792
Jesus Christ, Debbie, you...

27:49.501 --> 27:51.711
You always take everything too far.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.004
It is always about you.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.590
Do you ever think
about the person on the other side?

27:56.341 --> 27:57.926
Are you calling me a bad mother?

27:58.968 --> 27:59.886
I didn't say that.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.061
He ate. He crawled around the floor.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.730
We read the book about the moon.

28:10.814 --> 28:13.274
We said good night
to everything in the room.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.027
And I'm going home.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.408
Good night, Mark.

28:22.450 --> 28:23.410
Good night.
