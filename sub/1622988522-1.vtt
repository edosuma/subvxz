00:12.389 --> 00:14.090
Once bread becomes toast,

00:14.225 --> 00:17.394
it can never
become bread again.

00:17.526 --> 00:19.028
Once you've made a mistake,
you look at that moment.

00:19.162 --> 00:20.396
You think of everything

00:20.531 --> 00:21.331
that you could have
done differently,

00:21.465 --> 00:23.767
but that moment is gone.

00:23.899 --> 00:27.436
Every yes instead of no,
every left instead of right.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.572
My life could have changed.

00:29.706 --> 00:34.377
Like, I had this cute
redhead crush from my art class

00:34.511 --> 00:36.813
named Stephanie
handcuffed to my bedpost

00:36.947 --> 00:38.581
at my parents' house.

00:38.715 --> 00:41.051
I couldn't have been a day
over 16, and she was older.

00:41.184 --> 00:44.188
I know
because she drove us there.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.721
And...

00:45.855 --> 00:49.325
Redheads were like
this county fair cotton candy.

00:50.326 --> 00:52.395
It started as a joke, really.

00:52.529 --> 00:54.598
I had these handcuffs
that I lost the key to,

00:54.732 --> 00:57.167
but I taught myself
how to pick them.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.901
Well, the truth is,
I had no idea

00:59.035 --> 01:00.237
what to do with a hot girl.

01:00.369 --> 01:02.271
I thought I did,
and handcuffs were like

01:02.405 --> 01:05.541
these dirty-sounding things
for some reason.

01:05.675 --> 01:07.377
Anyway, I've got
this hot redhead

01:07.509 --> 01:09.446
chained to my bed,

01:09.578 --> 01:11.613
And I slowly work up the nerve,

01:11.747 --> 01:13.550
not to kiss her
like some smooth guy,

01:13.682 --> 01:17.187
but to dive headlong
into taking her shirt off,

01:17.319 --> 01:19.154
button by button,

01:19.288 --> 01:21.023
like
the greatest Christmas present

01:21.157 --> 01:23.060
a Jewish boy ever had.

01:23.193 --> 01:26.063
And I'm just hypnotized
by these sweet little bubblegum

01:26.196 --> 01:28.765
pink nipples that are so hard,
they're ready to bounce off

01:28.899 --> 01:30.800
these milky white,
slightly tan,

01:30.934 --> 01:32.069
lightly freckled titties

01:32.202 --> 01:33.836
that are pointing up
towards the sky.

01:33.970 --> 01:35.438
Ahh.

01:35.571 --> 01:40.410
So I move in slowly,
just planning my attack,

01:40.544 --> 01:42.846
thinking about everything
I'm gonna do,

01:42.979 --> 01:44.847
each button closer,

01:44.981 --> 01:47.250
like my life is going
to spring forward

01:47.384 --> 01:48.852
into having meaning
for the first time,

01:48.985 --> 01:50.553
because as far as I know,

01:50.687 --> 01:53.222
I'm about to bang the shit
out of this really hot redhead.

01:53.356 --> 01:55.658
Every American boy's dream.

01:56.726 --> 02:00.697
And then I hear my parents' car
crunching gravel outside.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.264
Then I hear my sister's voice

02:02.399 --> 02:04.467
calling as she's
coming up the stairs.

02:04.601 --> 02:06.436
Now, have you ever tried
to pick a tiny handcuff lock

02:06.569 --> 02:08.071
while you have a raging boner

02:08.204 --> 02:11.273
and thinking about where you're
gonna hide a hot redhead?

02:11.407 --> 02:13.476
I tell you, it can't be done.

02:14.411 --> 02:16.880
So, my sister comes
barreling up the stairs,

02:17.013 --> 02:18.615
tries to walk in,

02:18.747 --> 02:21.251
and I jam the door
shut with my foot.

02:21.384 --> 02:22.685
But it's too late.
She can already see

02:22.818 --> 02:24.821
the pair of feet
that are tied to the bed.

02:24.954 --> 02:27.156
It's not like she doesn't know
I have a girl in my room

02:27.291 --> 02:31.026
or that she doesn't recognize
the car outside, right?

02:31.161 --> 02:34.598
So, she is such a tattletale.

02:34.731 --> 02:39.202
She runs downstairs,
yells to my mother,

02:39.335 --> 02:42.271
"Michael's got Stephanie
tied to his bed,

02:42.405 --> 02:44.741
and he won't open the door."

02:44.875 --> 02:48.211
Stephanie is just mortified
and freaked out.

02:48.345 --> 02:49.545
I think
about every little thing

02:49.680 --> 02:50.580
that I could have done
differently

02:50.714 --> 02:51.681
not to get caught, but...

02:51.815 --> 02:53.316
you know, there's no choice,

02:53.449 --> 02:56.485
and it's not I can
jump out of the window.

02:56.619 --> 02:59.521
So I throw on my jeans.
I go downstairs.

02:59.656 --> 03:01.792
Stephanie waits upstairs.

03:01.924 --> 03:03.526
I see my parents
at the dining table

03:03.660 --> 03:05.862
in their swivel chairs

03:05.995 --> 03:07.731
like some job interview.

03:07.864 --> 03:11.934
They're just shaking their
disappointed mom and dad heads.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.437
I don't deny anything because,
you know, what's the point?

03:15.572 --> 03:17.807
I just wait
for the hammer to drop.

03:17.941 --> 03:20.943
Wait for them to start
screaming and shouting.

03:21.078 --> 03:23.981
But after a long,
awkward silence,

03:24.114 --> 03:25.815
you know what they do?

03:25.948 --> 03:29.418
They look at each other,
they look at me.

03:29.551 --> 03:31.888
My mom reaches
into her purse and grabs $10

03:32.021 --> 03:35.691
and tells me to take
Stephanie to Burger King.

03:35.825 --> 03:37.894
Could have been a fucking
commercial from Burger King,

03:38.027 --> 03:39.662
come to think of it.

03:39.797 --> 03:42.733
Michael, tell me
what happened.

03:42.865 --> 03:44.667
So I took her
to Burger King.

03:44.801 --> 03:47.303
- I'm sorry?
- What?

03:47.436 --> 03:50.739
- I need you to listen to me.
- Okay.

03:50.874 --> 03:53.175
I'm going to have
to cut you off.

03:53.309 --> 03:55.412
You're not listening to me.

03:55.544 --> 03:57.815
Focus.

04:01.050 --> 04:02.952
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

04:03.085 --> 04:06.956
Can you recall exactly
how it was that you died?

04:07.090 --> 04:10.059
- What?
- I want you to concentrate.

04:10.193 --> 04:14.832
Think very hard, please.
What is your very last memory?

04:14.965 --> 04:17.632
Try to reach out
and pull it in.

04:17.766 --> 04:21.636
What happened?
What?

04:21.769 --> 04:24.140
Keep going, keep going.

04:24.273 --> 04:25.574
- No, I see it.
- Excuse us.

04:25.708 --> 04:28.678
- And it's delayed.
- Ugh! After all that?

04:28.811 --> 04:30.212
After all that.

04:30.347 --> 04:31.481
I'm getting a drink.

04:31.614 --> 04:33.949
- Oh, Jesus.
- What? Don't even.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.386
I didn't say anything.

04:35.518 --> 04:37.653
My iPhone said the flight
was on time.

04:37.787 --> 04:39.888
Yeah, well, we don't really
control the apps here,

04:40.023 --> 04:41.458
just the official board
behind me.

04:41.592 --> 04:43.993
"Just the official board
behind her."

04:44.126 --> 04:45.929
Sorry.

04:47.730 --> 04:49.431
I don't even know
why I'm doing this.

04:49.566 --> 04:50.767
I just had a family trip
three weeks ago.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.435
My family, which is bad enough.

04:52.568 --> 04:55.371
Your family is your family,
not my family.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.508
We should get back.
The plane should be boarding.

04:59.441 --> 05:01.644
Yeah.

05:09.686 --> 05:11.321
I can't do this.

05:11.455 --> 05:15.959
It's not right with us, and you
want me to pretend that it is.

05:16.092 --> 05:17.727
I did that for 10 years
in my marriage,

05:17.861 --> 05:19.162
and I'm not doing it again
with you.

05:19.294 --> 05:21.063
I'm sorry.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.765
You're not gonna
say anything to me?

05:22.898 --> 05:24.535
Amy.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.268
<i>We will now begin boarding
for service to Pittsburgh.</i>

05:26.402 --> 05:27.771
<i>All active military...</i>

05:27.903 --> 05:29.405
- Amy, I just...
- <i>...any disabled people,</i>

05:29.539 --> 05:31.140
<i>and all Ruby Class
and Gold Class club members.</i>

05:31.273 --> 05:33.809
- Amy, just...
- <i>We will now begin boarding</i>

05:33.943 --> 05:36.580
<i>rows one through eight
for service to Pittsburgh.</i>

05:36.712 --> 05:38.513
Amy, please just see
how you feel

05:38.648 --> 05:40.850
when you get there, okay?

05:40.984 --> 05:42.219
No, I'm sorry.

05:42.352 --> 05:44.321
I'm gonna get a cab
back to the apartment.

05:44.453 --> 05:46.989
Just go without me, go have fun
with your parents, okay?

05:48.558 --> 05:50.694
Uh, wait.

05:51.794 --> 05:53.162
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

05:53.296 --> 05:54.530
How many times
do I have to tell you

05:54.664 --> 05:55.965
not to touch people?

05:56.099 --> 05:58.034
Why does it look like
you're smiling?

05:58.167 --> 06:00.937
You think this is funny?
Is that what you think?

06:01.071 --> 06:03.940
I'm not smiling, okay?
Just...

06:04.073 --> 06:06.043
I knew when you ordered
two vodka sodas,

06:06.176 --> 06:07.777
you weren't going
to get on that plane.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.779
Oh, you think this has to do
with my drinking?

06:09.912 --> 06:11.047
- Yeah.
- Well, whatever.

06:11.181 --> 06:14.217
This is not
because of my drinking.

06:14.350 --> 06:15.818
- Okay.
- Okay?

06:15.951 --> 06:19.055
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

06:24.761 --> 06:27.631
You don't have anything else
to say to me?

06:31.301 --> 06:34.837
Just seems funny that
if one plane isn't delayed

06:34.970 --> 06:37.773
for an hour,
we don't break up.

06:38.907 --> 06:41.912
One little connecting flight
from Dallas isn't late.

06:42.044 --> 06:44.146
Maybe one little engine problem
is the difference

06:44.280 --> 06:47.650
between you and I staring into
the eyes of our grandchildren

06:47.784 --> 06:49.452
and being buried together
50 years from now

06:49.585 --> 06:50.886
or you getting in a cab

06:51.020 --> 06:53.289
and going home
to a new life without me.

06:54.222 --> 06:56.059
No.

06:56.191 --> 06:59.095
This would have happened
back at your parents' condo

06:59.229 --> 07:00.731
or back home, okay?

07:00.864 --> 07:03.100
- Maybe you're right.
- Or...

07:03.866 --> 07:05.902
Okay.

07:07.903 --> 07:10.139
You're not serious.

07:13.042 --> 07:15.011
Jesus.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.936
<i>So you guys broke up?</i>

07:41.071 --> 07:42.205
And this time
I'm gonna hold her to it.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.773
<i>For real this time?</i>

07:43.907 --> 07:45.809
I told her the next drunk
panic breakup was it.

07:45.941 --> 07:48.477
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- Christ.

07:48.611 --> 07:51.047
I just realized I don't have
any money for the toll.

07:51.181 --> 07:54.450
Goddamn toll is only
a goddamn quarter.

07:54.583 --> 07:58.187
- <i>You don't have any money?</i>
- Nope, don't have a quarter.

07:58.321 --> 08:00.155
Yeah, nope, thought
I was getting on the plane.

08:00.289 --> 08:01.590
- <i>Man.</i>
- Now I've got to get off

08:01.724 --> 08:04.828
the goddamn exit
and go to the ATM.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.162
<i>I can't believe this, man.</i>

08:09.765 --> 08:11.400
<i>Are you still there?</i>

08:11.534 --> 08:14.070
- Yeah, and I missed the ramp.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

08:14.203 --> 08:15.804
Yeah, I just
gotta back up now.

08:15.938 --> 08:17.007
- <i>On the highway?</i>
- Uh-huh, on the highway.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.074
Shush.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.708
- <i>You're doing what?</i>
- What?

08:19.842 --> 08:21.244
<i>In the middle
of a fucking highway?</i>

08:21.378 --> 08:22.979
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

08:23.111 --> 08:25.314
<i>I hope you're all right.
None of my business.</i>

08:25.449 --> 08:28.383
<i>Do what you want,
which you will.</i>

08:31.420 --> 08:33.756
That's really the last thing
I remember.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.491
I think that's all.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.861
Let me think.

08:38.994 --> 08:42.465
Try to remember.
You can do it.

08:42.597 --> 08:44.934
Open your mind.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.802
I still have this quarter.

08:46.936 --> 08:49.473
Where did you get
that quarter?

08:49.605 --> 08:51.072
Picked it up.

08:51.206 --> 08:55.577
You picked up the quarter.
And then what do you remember?

08:55.711 --> 08:58.413
That I hit something?

08:58.547 --> 08:59.948
Think it through, Michael.

09:00.082 --> 09:03.552
It's easier if you figure it
out for yourself.

09:03.686 --> 09:05.687
Something hit my car.

09:05.821 --> 09:09.292
A truck hit your car.

09:09.426 --> 09:12.362
What's the very next thing
you remember?

09:12.494 --> 09:13.995
Sitting right here.

09:14.129 --> 09:16.999
I told you about the redhead.

09:18.301 --> 09:20.902
I knew you'd get it.
Very good.

09:22.973 --> 09:25.909
- Am I in a hospital?
- No.

09:26.042 --> 09:29.011
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I'm not a doctor.

09:29.144 --> 09:31.880
This isn't a hospital.
I am here to help you.

09:32.014 --> 09:33.383
My name is Scarlett.

09:33.516 --> 09:35.484
Okay, Scarlett.
Am I in rehab or something?

09:35.618 --> 09:36.652
I mean, I wasn't drinking.

09:36.786 --> 09:38.922
Think, Michael.

09:39.055 --> 09:42.425
Remember,
and then hold on to the memory

09:42.557 --> 09:44.326
and bring it back with you.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.897
It's important.

09:50.867 --> 09:53.469
Am I in heaven or something?

09:53.603 --> 09:54.771
You're dead, Michael,

09:54.903 --> 09:57.773
and I am very sorry about that.

09:57.907 --> 10:00.643
You have
my deepest condolences.

10:00.777 --> 10:01.911
But you're not finished yet.

10:02.043 --> 10:04.246
There are some loose ends.

10:04.379 --> 10:07.316
What are you talking
about, "loose ends?"

10:07.450 --> 10:08.685
Wait.

10:08.819 --> 10:11.354
No, no, I can't be dead.
I got stuff to do.

10:11.488 --> 10:13.089
- No.
- No, no.

10:13.223 --> 10:15.491
I got a one man-show I'm doing.
Opening night is coming up.

10:15.624 --> 10:17.126
No.

10:17.259 --> 10:19.961
How long have I been here?
I've got to get home.

10:20.095 --> 10:21.330
I've got to take care
of Banshee, my cat.

10:21.464 --> 10:22.999
You're not thinking
this through.

10:23.132 --> 10:24.334
Oh, yeah.
Yes, I am.

10:24.466 --> 10:26.035
I am thinking this
all the way through, okay?

10:26.168 --> 10:28.603
I can't be dead, all right?
I have obligations.

10:28.738 --> 10:31.241
Can I make a call?
Where's my phone?

10:31.374 --> 10:34.577
God dammit!
Ah!

10:34.710 --> 10:35.979
What happened?

10:36.111 --> 10:38.680
- You are dead.
- Huh.

10:38.815 --> 10:40.617
But you have left

10:40.750 --> 10:43.452
one important detail
unfinished.

10:43.586 --> 10:46.455
Oh.
Oh, shit.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.458
I'm not religious.

10:49.593 --> 10:50.627
Not that.

10:50.759 --> 10:53.128
I'm talking
about your soul mate.

10:53.262 --> 10:54.531
I mean,
my parents were Jewish,

10:54.663 --> 10:56.633
but we had a Christmas tree.

10:56.766 --> 10:57.634
Couldn't call it
a Christmas tree.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.232
It was very confusing.

10:59.234 --> 11:01.270
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
My soul, did you say?

11:01.403 --> 11:04.773
Not your soul.
Your soul mate.

11:04.907 --> 11:08.811
Unfortunately, you died single.

11:08.945 --> 11:11.848
That left your soul incomplete.

11:11.980 --> 11:13.316
So?

11:13.450 --> 11:16.085
Well, that's a problem.
I'm sorry.

11:16.219 --> 11:17.521
Come to think of it,

11:17.653 --> 11:19.388
my girlfriend
did just break up with me.

11:19.522 --> 11:25.527
Souls cross over in pairs
and only in pairs.

11:25.662 --> 11:27.897
You have to find a soul mate.

11:28.031 --> 11:30.166
You're kidding.
How?

11:30.300 --> 11:32.835
It's not as difficult
as it might sound,

11:32.969 --> 11:35.972
but it can be daunting
for some people.

11:36.105 --> 11:38.173
You don't say.
People are weirded out by this?

11:38.306 --> 11:41.577
Some people have trouble
adjusting to being dead.

11:41.710 --> 11:44.046
And then, yes, the dating.

11:44.180 --> 11:46.282
- You're serious.
- You need to focus.

11:46.416 --> 11:47.883
You realize I've been dating
my whole life

11:48.017 --> 11:49.251
without much success?

11:49.384 --> 11:51.953
Yes, and that's why
we're here now.

11:52.088 --> 11:54.090
The soul mate cliché
is quite real.

11:54.223 --> 11:56.592
That's why everyone makes
such a big deal about it,

11:56.725 --> 12:00.329
whether they know it on
some subconscious level or not.

12:00.463 --> 12:03.567
You'll have to find one
before you go on,

12:03.700 --> 12:05.435
or there won't be any going on.

12:05.567 --> 12:06.836
Go on to what?

12:06.970 --> 12:09.138
You'll find out
once you find someone.

12:09.272 --> 12:11.607
Souls come in alone,
but they go out in pairs.

12:11.739 --> 12:13.142
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

12:13.276 --> 12:16.479
It is the purpose,
the secret,

12:16.613 --> 12:19.082
the meaning of life,
you might say.

12:19.215 --> 12:21.450
You realize this is
fucked up, right?

12:21.584 --> 12:23.285
I mean, what about
little kids who died,

12:23.418 --> 12:26.154
or people who get married
three times?

12:26.288 --> 12:27.590
I mean, who do they
move on with?

12:27.724 --> 12:30.059
I'm not gonna argue
with you, Michael.

12:31.327 --> 12:34.997
Wait.
So I die...

12:35.130 --> 12:36.798
then I have to meet a girl.

12:36.932 --> 12:39.200
It doesn't have to be a girl.
It doesn't have to be a guy.

12:39.335 --> 12:41.804
It just has to be
the right person for you.

12:41.937 --> 12:45.341
And they have to feel
the same way too, or no go.

12:45.475 --> 12:47.643
People go their whole lives
without finding

12:47.777 --> 12:49.177
- the right person.
- Yes.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.912
And then they end up here
in my office

12:51.047 --> 12:52.480
muttering about redheads

12:52.614 --> 12:54.182
and asking what happened
till I get them to focus.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.286
- Uh-huh.
- This can take time.

12:56.418 --> 12:59.321
So like, find
a simultaneous orgasm or bust?

12:59.455 --> 13:02.090
Exactly, but without the sex.

13:02.225 --> 13:04.326
Sex clouds the mind,
so we've unclouded it for you.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.261
Thank you.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.062
Clarity is gonna come in handy.

13:07.196 --> 13:08.431
You'll see.

13:08.564 --> 13:09.933
I mean...

13:10.066 --> 13:11.499
Where do I even start?

13:11.633 --> 13:14.135
Just remember,
things are different here.

13:14.269 --> 13:16.239
Removing those things
allows you to focus

13:16.373 --> 13:18.074
on what's really important.

13:18.206 --> 13:21.009
So I just ask
dead girls on dates?

13:21.143 --> 13:23.345
Sure.
Why not?

13:23.479 --> 13:24.513
Great.

13:24.647 --> 13:26.116
Are you free for dinner?

13:26.249 --> 13:28.651
I have a soul mate, Michael,
and I've already crossed over.

13:28.784 --> 13:30.653
You're not the first person
to make that joke,

13:30.787 --> 13:33.489
and I can tell you
it just keeps getting funnier.

13:33.623 --> 13:35.090
Now, you have to go.

13:35.224 --> 13:36.825
I have literally
tens of thousands

13:36.959 --> 13:38.294
of appointments today.

13:38.427 --> 13:41.196
So, there's an afterlife,
and you've moved on,

13:41.330 --> 13:43.566
but while you're here,
you have a job?

13:43.700 --> 13:45.167
Yes.

13:45.301 --> 13:46.402
Just sounds like you got
a raw deal here, I mean...

13:46.536 --> 13:48.104
I'm here to help you,
Michael.

13:48.238 --> 13:50.239
I want to be here.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.408
You have to go.

13:52.541 --> 13:53.542
Go where?

13:53.676 --> 13:56.179
The entire world
and all the infinite fish

13:56.311 --> 13:59.547
in the sea are
through that door behind you.

13:59.681 --> 14:01.316
All the rotting fish
in the sea.

14:01.450 --> 14:03.252
You can go anywhere
you want to,

14:03.385 --> 14:05.154
see anything you want to,

14:05.287 --> 14:08.090
and be your truest self
for the first time.

14:08.224 --> 14:12.027
No one in the living world
can see you or stop you.

14:12.161 --> 14:14.631
With the exception
of not being able to eat

14:14.763 --> 14:16.331
and a few other limitations,

14:16.465 --> 14:18.133
the world is
your private sandbox.

14:18.267 --> 14:21.371
- Is my mother in on this?
- You should get started.

14:21.503 --> 14:23.273
It's time.

14:24.407 --> 14:26.941
- And if I have any questions?
- You're on your own,

14:27.075 --> 14:28.945
until you're no longer
on your own.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.480
I'll see you when you're ready.

14:48.764 --> 14:49.931
Wait.

14:57.071 --> 14:59.207
Hello?

15:16.325 --> 15:18.194
This sucks.

15:47.288 --> 15:49.057
I'll never get used
to not having a phone.

15:49.191 --> 15:50.191
I mean, how do I find anything?

15:50.325 --> 15:52.561
Like literally anything?

15:52.695 --> 15:55.198
You know what?
This is great.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.298
Women love men who fish around
in their pockets

15:57.432 --> 16:00.168
and talk to themselves.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.073
Come on, ladies.

16:22.325 --> 16:24.993
Hey, buddy,
can I ask you a question?

16:25.127 --> 16:26.128
No?

16:29.932 --> 16:32.167
Hello?

16:33.034 --> 16:34.803
Anybody?

16:35.336 --> 16:37.639
Nobody, really?

16:56.291 --> 16:59.061
Oh, thank you,
fucking God.

16:59.195 --> 17:02.164
Mwah!
Okay.

17:07.602 --> 17:10.938
Yeah!
At least we have that!

17:13.041 --> 17:17.311
Oh, yeah.
Hello ladies.

17:18.112 --> 17:20.182
Sorry.

17:20.315 --> 17:22.050
Whoop.

17:22.184 --> 17:23.219
You'll do.

17:27.888 --> 17:30.559
Yeah! Needed that.

17:33.596 --> 17:34.930
Hey, what's the matter?

17:35.063 --> 17:36.965
You never seen a dead guy
get drunk before?

17:37.099 --> 17:40.034
Shoot, I'm too gone, right?

17:41.771 --> 17:43.339
Oh, yeah!

17:45.240 --> 17:46.542
I never liked you anyway.

17:48.744 --> 17:51.347
I never liked any of you!

17:51.481 --> 17:54.217
That's why we're here, right?

17:54.350 --> 17:56.519
Nobody loved us.
We're all single.

17:58.821 --> 18:00.422
Hey, you know what?

18:00.555 --> 18:01.889
Round of drinks
for all my

18:02.023 --> 18:04.327
dearly departed friends.

18:08.930 --> 18:10.098
Hey buddy, excuse me.

18:10.232 --> 18:11.634
Fuck off.

18:11.766 --> 18:13.635
No, I was just gonna
ask you a question.

18:13.769 --> 18:15.939
What part of "fuck off"
don't you understand?

18:16.071 --> 18:18.474
You deaf, dumb and dead?
Eh?

18:18.608 --> 18:20.243
Want to hear it
in another language?

18:20.376 --> 18:22.645
Hablo el "fuck off" -o?

18:34.423 --> 18:37.026
Hey, there.
Hi.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.962
I'm Mike.
What's your name?

18:40.094 --> 18:44.866
Just trying to make
a little conversation.

18:45.000 --> 18:45.934
Hey, there.

18:46.068 --> 18:47.470
Hey, I'm Mike.

18:47.602 --> 18:49.937
Hey!
Nice pajamas.

18:50.071 --> 18:54.376
Did you die in your sleep
or you just lazy?

18:54.510 --> 18:56.779
You can talk to me.

19:01.350 --> 19:04.887
So how do I find my soul mate
if no one will talk to me?

19:05.021 --> 19:06.122
I'm trying to play along.

19:06.254 --> 19:07.156
I don't know
why you're complaining.

19:07.290 --> 19:09.225
We all got the same problem.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.926
Thank you.
You talked to me.

19:11.060 --> 19:13.329
Please, no.
I need to know what's going on.

19:13.462 --> 19:15.097
I need to talk to somebody,
anybody, please.

19:15.230 --> 19:16.565
It's New York.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.033
Even when you're alive,
no one wants to talk to you,

19:18.167 --> 19:20.468
especially
when you look desperate.

19:20.601 --> 19:23.571
So what do I do?

19:23.705 --> 19:26.609
Listen, you had the same
counseling we all did, right?

19:26.743 --> 19:28.210
Well, it all sucks.
It sucks for us all.

19:28.342 --> 19:30.513
You just got to get through it.

19:30.646 --> 19:34.249
It's like hell on Earth.
They call it dating.

19:34.382 --> 19:37.119
- Yeah, well, what's the point?
- Who said there's a point?

19:37.252 --> 19:40.022
Just think about love
and forever.

19:40.156 --> 19:43.158
And what would you say to
the girl if it really mattered?

19:43.292 --> 19:44.926
What would you say?

19:48.363 --> 19:50.332
I have no idea where to go.

19:50.465 --> 19:51.633
Yep.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.969
Get in line
with the rest of us, buddy.

19:55.036 --> 19:56.071
Wait.

19:56.205 --> 19:57.473
How do I find someone

19:57.606 --> 19:59.442
if I don't see anybody
most of the time?

19:59.574 --> 20:01.076
Come on, don't be dumb.

20:01.209 --> 20:05.680
Just squint really hard,
and you see whoever you want.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.650
Work on it.
It gets easier.

20:08.783 --> 20:10.686
Squint?

20:11.686 --> 20:15.389
Squinting to see people.

20:20.462 --> 20:22.196
Urgh!

20:23.899 --> 20:25.534
Whoa!

20:26.301 --> 20:27.803
Yes!

20:28.471 --> 20:30.205
Saw you!

20:33.609 --> 20:36.111
I see you.

20:36.946 --> 20:38.580
It works.

20:41.716 --> 20:42.984
Are you alive or dead here?

20:43.118 --> 20:44.921
Because I really can't get
a read on it.

21:40.542 --> 21:43.011
Always heads.

21:47.183 --> 21:51.520
Heads.
I lose again.

21:58.392 --> 22:00.896
This is so unreal.

22:20.750 --> 22:23.919
Where would I go if I was
the girl of my dreams?

22:37.532 --> 22:39.801
Excuse me.

22:41.536 --> 22:43.104
Could you even look at me?

22:43.237 --> 22:45.606
- I'm waiting for someone else.
- Someone else?

22:45.741 --> 22:47.076
Anyone else.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.477
How do you know it's not
worth talking to me?

22:49.610 --> 22:52.947
Educated guess,
life experience.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.782
Was it because of the
polite way I said "excuse me"?

22:54.917 --> 22:57.419
All right, fine.

22:57.552 --> 23:01.189
So, small talk.
How did you die?

23:01.323 --> 23:02.690
Isn't that kind of personal?

23:02.824 --> 23:05.126
I was hit by a truck.
You?

23:06.094 --> 23:08.462
Mountain climbing.
What did you do with your time?

23:08.597 --> 23:09.965
Is that little laugh
supposed to mean

23:10.099 --> 23:11.567
that you died
better than I did?

23:11.701 --> 23:13.001
I mean, you could have
been hit by a truck.

23:13.135 --> 23:14.603
You ever cross
the street before?

23:14.735 --> 23:17.272
- I have to go.
- I was an actor.

23:17.406 --> 23:20.775
And you?

23:20.909 --> 23:23.611
Founded
an international charity.

23:23.744 --> 23:25.013
Of course you did.

23:25.147 --> 23:26.148
Listen.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.317
I'm sure you're a great guy
in your own way

23:28.449 --> 23:30.484
and probably charming,

23:30.619 --> 23:32.454
but that doesn't really
go far here.

23:32.588 --> 23:33.888
You can't just hook up.

23:34.022 --> 23:35.456
I didn't say I wanted to.

23:35.590 --> 23:37.025
"Good enough"
isn't good enough here.

23:37.158 --> 23:39.995
- So, I'm not even worth a try?
- Not for me.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.598
Listen, this is not like
the world we're used to.

23:42.732 --> 23:44.066
There's nothing good on TV.

23:44.198 --> 23:47.369
There's nothing on TV.
It's literally blank.

23:47.503 --> 23:48.403
Blank.

23:48.536 --> 23:50.705
- TV is blank?
- Mm.

23:50.839 --> 23:51.907
We're like dogs.

23:52.041 --> 23:53.742
It's on,
but we don't really see it.

23:53.876 --> 23:57.012
Why do I not find that
reassuring?

23:57.145 --> 23:59.948
Look around you.
Everything here is weird.

24:00.081 --> 24:02.251
But at least we have alcohol.

24:02.385 --> 24:05.420
It doesn't ease the pain
of talking to people.

24:05.553 --> 24:07.188
No offense.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.225
How has somebody
not snatched you up yet?

24:11.694 --> 24:13.462
It's not that simple.

24:13.594 --> 24:14.896
Listen, when you're
here long enough,

24:15.030 --> 24:17.866
you'll learn to see
when the spark isn't there.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.267
All right, so what am I
supposed to do?

24:20.401 --> 24:21.869
Find some girl.

24:22.003 --> 24:23.571
I don't know,
but just don't think

24:23.705 --> 24:25.206
like you're trying
to get her in bed.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.176
Don't talk about TV or trivia
or politics or food

24:28.310 --> 24:30.579
or any of that shit that used
to mean something.

24:30.712 --> 24:32.080
Like... sports.

24:32.214 --> 24:34.782
Nobody here wants to see
your baseball card collection,

24:34.917 --> 24:37.586
your ex-wife, your job.

24:37.718 --> 24:40.321
It's all gone, all equal.

24:40.455 --> 24:41.790
Unless I was an actor,

24:41.924 --> 24:44.359
which, in that case,
fuck me, right?

24:44.493 --> 24:46.662
You're here to find
the person

24:46.795 --> 24:50.565
that you didn't find in life
to spend eternity with.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.400
Eternity is
a long fucking time.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.236
I mean, I don't even know
what I have left to offer.

24:55.370 --> 24:58.540
Then pour yourself
a tall, stiff drink

24:58.673 --> 25:01.377
and wait it out.

25:01.510 --> 25:02.978
I've got to at least try.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.813
I guess, I mean... don't I?

25:05.946 --> 25:08.215
It's up to you.
I mean...

25:08.350 --> 25:10.686
Take a look around you.

25:10.819 --> 25:13.222
Why are you in a bar?

25:13.355 --> 25:15.458
Where else is there?

25:15.590 --> 25:19.794
Hopefully, for you,
something more.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.264
What about for you?

25:23.398 --> 25:28.204
What would you offer a girl
like me if you had the chance?

25:28.337 --> 25:30.305
You know that funny tingling
feeling you get

25:30.438 --> 25:33.475
when some guy's jerking off
to the memory of the night

25:33.608 --> 25:34.877
you looked your best?

25:35.010 --> 25:36.645
On a good night,
I could remind you of that.

25:36.779 --> 25:38.446
Yeah, okay.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.616
On a bad night, I could
at least make you laugh.

25:40.750 --> 25:41.616
Mm.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.318
Hey!
Hey.

25:43.452 --> 25:46.855
How about heads, you stay
and have another drink with me?

25:46.988 --> 25:49.725
Tails, I'll leave you alone?

25:49.858 --> 25:51.025
No, thanks.

25:51.159 --> 25:55.363
Your misogyny
overwhelms all other charms.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.800
It was gonna be tails anyway.

26:37.906 --> 26:40.576
Jesus, Mary
and Johnny Weissmuller.

26:41.243 --> 26:44.412
What do I gotta do
to get out of this town?

27:25.553 --> 27:27.421
Sorry.

27:31.726 --> 27:33.262
Wait.

27:34.061 --> 27:35.563
Wait, what was...

27:37.599 --> 27:39.301
Hello?

27:41.802 --> 27:43.905
Hello?

27:57.819 --> 27:59.854
Wow.

28:14.069 --> 28:15.870
All right.
How's this go again?

28:16.003 --> 28:19.542
Just think hard, strain to see.

28:23.946 --> 28:24.913
Like squinting
is good enough.

28:25.045 --> 28:26.547
Come on, just...

28:26.680 --> 28:28.850
All right, you can do this.

28:39.394 --> 28:40.896
Mom.

28:41.029 --> 28:42.231
Just fill the bags,
I guess.

28:42.363 --> 28:43.697
Dad.

28:43.831 --> 28:45.399
I'm giving the clothes away
so we don't have to sort.

28:45.532 --> 28:48.203
I don't want his things
in garbage bags.

28:48.336 --> 28:50.338
Well, what are we going
to do with them?

28:50.472 --> 28:53.041
We don't need to rush
his things out the door.

28:53.175 --> 28:54.176
No, exactly!

28:54.309 --> 28:55.978
Because, I mean,
what's the rush?

28:56.110 --> 28:59.148
Maybe the family wants
some of them or his friends.

28:59.281 --> 29:00.883
Some of these
are good clothes.

29:01.015 --> 29:02.650
Who's gonna want these?

29:02.783 --> 29:05.152
I mean, none of these are
very good clothes, you know.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.087
Okay, some people would kill
for that jacket.

29:07.222 --> 29:08.991
And look at this jacket.

29:09.123 --> 29:11.425
Nobody would be caught dead
in this jacket.

29:11.559 --> 29:14.229
Mom, we're not here
to critique his fashion.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.630
Whatever.
You do the clothes.

29:16.764 --> 29:18.132
I'm gonna get the drawers.

29:18.266 --> 29:20.134
I wish you had buried me
in that jacket.

29:20.269 --> 29:22.037
I love that fucking jacket.

29:22.169 --> 29:24.305
I met a beautiful girl
in that jacket.

29:24.439 --> 29:25.372
Took her home.

29:25.506 --> 29:27.441
Bet you her number's
still in the pocket.

29:27.574 --> 29:28.744
Oh, well.

29:28.877 --> 29:32.414
Some homeless guy is gonna have
the night of his life.

29:33.349 --> 29:35.417
I can't believe
I missed my own funeral.

29:36.451 --> 29:37.485
Look it.

29:37.619 --> 29:38.786
I would have loved
to have seen that.

29:38.919 --> 29:40.888
- It's running.
- Hmm.

29:41.023 --> 29:42.157
An actor's dream.

29:42.290 --> 29:45.661
His watch is running.
It's running.

29:45.793 --> 29:47.094
Yes.

29:47.228 --> 29:49.229
That's all you have to say?

29:49.363 --> 29:51.865
I'm getting the drawers.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.137
No, Barbie.
Don't go in the drawers.

29:55.270 --> 29:57.205
Hey, Dad.
Somebody?

29:57.339 --> 29:58.706
Can't we just call
Bob or Jesse?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.876
I'd really rather have a guy
take care of this.

30:02.077 --> 30:03.912
Okay, well, there you go.

30:04.044 --> 30:06.782
- Ugh!
- I warned you.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.984
Come on, we're all
adults here, right?

30:10.118 --> 30:11.753
Like you've never
seen that before.

30:11.886 --> 30:13.354
All right?

30:13.487 --> 30:15.923
20 bucks says there is nothing
in that fridge but beer.

30:16.057 --> 30:17.793
There'll be pickles.

30:17.926 --> 30:19.328
I always bring him pickles.

30:19.461 --> 30:20.895
Yeah, well, you know what?
You both lose.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.230
There's wine in there too,

30:22.363 --> 30:23.864
and pickles and shit
and light beer.

30:23.998 --> 30:26.768
Nothing but beer, 20 bucks?

30:26.901 --> 30:28.869
You're on.

30:29.003 --> 30:29.905
Look.
Look in the back.

30:30.038 --> 30:30.905
Pickles.
Come on.

30:31.039 --> 30:33.275
Look!
Pickles.

30:33.407 --> 30:35.042
- That's right.
- See? Pickles.

30:35.176 --> 30:36.410
That's food.
Doctors say so.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.713
I shouldn't ask you this,
but...

30:38.847 --> 30:41.883
were you disappointed in him,
what he did with his life?

30:42.015 --> 30:43.250
What he didn't do?

30:43.385 --> 30:45.052
What kind of question
is that?

30:45.186 --> 30:47.321
Not a bit.
He was who he was,

30:47.455 --> 30:49.491
and he wasn't gonna be
anybody else.

30:49.625 --> 30:52.961
If you have kids
who are kind and decent,

30:53.094 --> 30:54.628
wishing them a different life

30:54.763 --> 30:58.265
is like hoping an oak tree
will up and grow pine needles.

30:58.399 --> 31:01.436
What does that even mean?
My son wasn't a tree.

31:01.570 --> 31:03.571
I didn't care if he was
successful,

31:03.705 --> 31:05.407
not for its own sake.

31:05.540 --> 31:08.243
I didn't want him to go
into retail, necessarily.

31:08.376 --> 31:09.978
Not even a little bit?
Really?

31:10.110 --> 31:11.345
Really.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.047
I wanted him happy
and true to himself,

31:13.180 --> 31:14.782
and I think he was.

31:14.917 --> 31:16.217
I wanted him to be an actor.

31:16.350 --> 31:17.551
You guys act like I was
some sort

31:17.685 --> 31:19.521
of bus station hooker
or something.

31:19.654 --> 31:21.022
I didn't care if he was rich
or famous

31:21.156 --> 31:22.690
because he didn't care.

31:22.823 --> 31:25.759
It wasn't up to me anyway.
I liked who he was just fine.

31:25.894 --> 31:27.929
Yeah, well, you didn't look
in his sock drawer.

31:28.062 --> 31:28.929
Told you not to look.

31:29.063 --> 31:30.364
I just want him back.

31:30.497 --> 31:34.535
I would just like him to get
a chance to be happy,

31:34.668 --> 31:37.205
to find whatever it was
he was looking for.

31:37.339 --> 31:40.008
I'm still looking, Ma.
They won't let me stop.

31:40.140 --> 31:41.877
He was a wonderful actor.

31:42.010 --> 31:43.545
Oh, it wasn't fair to go
like that.

31:43.677 --> 31:44.946
It wasn't fair.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.849
I just wish he had a chance
to do that one-man show thing.

31:47.982 --> 31:50.285
I would have liked to see what
he made with that, you know?

31:50.418 --> 31:53.155
Two years seems like
such a waste now.

31:53.288 --> 31:57.259
I hated that man who gave
the speech at the ceremony.

31:57.391 --> 31:58.926
He hardly knew him.

31:59.061 --> 32:00.995
He pronounced
everybody's names wrong.

32:01.128 --> 32:03.031
And he's telling us
exactly what he's like.

32:03.165 --> 32:04.532
It was ridiculous.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.835
Help me with the boxes.
Gonna be dark soon.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.836
Your mother doesn't drive well
at night anymore.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.271
I have work in the morning.

32:10.405 --> 32:12.574
And this doesn't get
any easier if we wait.

32:14.275 --> 32:15.609
You guys are depressing me,
and it was my funeral.

32:15.744 --> 32:17.413
I think we should say
goodbye here.

32:17.545 --> 32:18.645
Goodbye?

32:18.780 --> 32:21.282
I mean, this is where
he spent his time.

32:21.416 --> 32:23.752
I feel like he was here.

32:23.886 --> 32:27.089
I feel as if we can feel him.

32:29.123 --> 32:32.060
Not in some ceremony.

32:33.594 --> 32:34.995
Goodbye, Dad.

32:35.129 --> 32:37.764
I'm not saying goodbye
to anybody yet.

32:37.898 --> 32:40.400
I'm still not convinced.

32:40.534 --> 32:42.137
Well, I can understand that.

32:42.271 --> 32:43.504
I don't know what
they put in the casket,

32:43.638 --> 32:45.040
but it must have looked
like gazpacho.

32:45.173 --> 32:48.042
I am not accepting this
until I decide to.

32:48.176 --> 32:49.410
Why should I?

32:49.544 --> 32:53.114
I mean, it doesn't feel to me
like he's gone.

32:54.715 --> 32:57.118
To me, it feels like
he's right here,

32:57.252 --> 32:59.922
like he's right here
in this room with us,

33:00.054 --> 33:05.058
and he's arguing about all
these stupid little details.

33:05.193 --> 33:09.064
He's here.
He's here!

33:09.196 --> 33:12.600
He's here until I say he's not.

33:14.101 --> 33:16.304
Thanks, Mom.

33:17.105 --> 33:19.374
Goodbye to you, too.

33:43.031 --> 33:45.300
I already bought
his Hanukkah presents.

33:45.433 --> 33:47.369
Ugh, no more drunken
Hannukah caroling

33:47.502 --> 33:49.937
yelling out car window
at the Orthodox Jews

33:50.071 --> 33:51.705
- in Williamsburg.
- In April.

33:51.840 --> 33:54.109
You guys can totally do that
without me, come on.

33:54.242 --> 33:56.211
I miss
every stupid annoying thing

33:56.343 --> 33:58.779
about his stupid annoying self.

33:58.913 --> 34:00.349
Thanks, I guess?

34:00.482 --> 34:03.618
He's not those boxes,
and he's not in that junk.

34:03.752 --> 34:05.887
And he wasn't in
that drawer either.

34:06.020 --> 34:07.788
It's probably some of me
in that strainer

34:07.922 --> 34:10.292
that they used
to fish me out of the car with.

34:10.424 --> 34:13.092
Just have to keep him
in mind and our memory.

34:13.228 --> 34:16.598
No, that's not good enough.

34:30.411 --> 34:32.481
Hey, buckle up.

34:37.252 --> 34:39.152
Bye.

34:49.730 --> 34:52.734
Okay, think of the bright side.

34:52.868 --> 34:55.636
What is the bright side?

34:55.770 --> 34:57.971
I don't know.

34:58.105 --> 35:01.508
I feel great physically.

35:01.643 --> 35:04.378
My cholesterol
is finally down to zero.

35:05.846 --> 35:09.517
Parking is no longer a problem.

35:11.418 --> 35:14.321
Nothing ever itches,

35:14.456 --> 35:16.925
but I've got
plenty of free time.

35:18.192 --> 35:20.996
I can go see my friends now.

35:22.996 --> 35:25.199
All right.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.004
Angelo!

35:31.706 --> 35:33.308
Angelo!

35:52.058 --> 35:55.830
Hey, Angelo?

35:55.964 --> 35:58.833
Angelo!
You here?

36:01.969 --> 36:03.371
Shit.

36:03.505 --> 36:06.273
Michael!

36:06.407 --> 36:09.243
Michael motherfucking Logan,
seriously?

36:09.377 --> 36:10.844
- Angelo?
- Mikey!

36:10.978 --> 36:13.148
Come here, bro!

36:13.281 --> 36:16.551
- It's me, big as death.
- Ah!

36:16.685 --> 36:17.886
- You're dead!
- Yeah.

36:18.018 --> 36:19.787
You look great.
This is fantastic.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.190
I'm so glad you're dead!
Never get to say that.

36:23.324 --> 36:24.558
I've never been
so happy to find

36:24.692 --> 36:27.194
that a friend of mine died.

36:27.328 --> 36:28.730
When the hell did you die?

36:28.862 --> 36:30.130
Just recently.

36:30.264 --> 36:32.634
I was trying to think of who I
knew that died single like me.

36:32.766 --> 36:35.969
Born to be a happy bachelor,
and died that way too.

36:36.103 --> 36:37.772
Not the way I thought
that was gonna work out,

36:37.904 --> 36:41.808
but hey, you live and learn.
Come on in, bro!

36:42.677 --> 36:45.113
Isn't this shit crazy,
this whole crazy system?

36:45.246 --> 36:46.548
I mean, can you believe it?

36:46.681 --> 36:48.417
I know, it's like playing
fucking musical chairs

36:48.549 --> 36:50.685
- to the death.
- Hey, you're telling me.

36:50.819 --> 36:53.554
And bro, have you tried
jerking off yet?

36:53.688 --> 36:54.923
It's like trying to drive
in neutral.

36:55.056 --> 36:56.324
Nothing, ghost dick.

36:56.458 --> 36:58.693
So, why'd they even let us
keep our dicks?

36:58.826 --> 37:00.128
- I know.
- No pissing either.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.295
I know, it's like they just
fucking mocking us.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.732
- With all of it.
- You said it.

37:03.864 --> 37:05.567
How much of a pisser was it
and when you found out

37:05.699 --> 37:07.435
that there's no kind of suicide
either, huh?

37:07.569 --> 37:08.869
Just got to stay
and wait it out.

37:09.002 --> 37:11.005
I mean, come on.
Tell me it's not just me.

37:11.139 --> 37:12.474
Oh, man.

37:12.607 --> 37:15.777
You just ruined
my next, like, 20 questions.

37:18.378 --> 37:19.913
So, what you doing here?

37:20.047 --> 37:22.417
I mean,
if you don't mind my asking.

37:22.551 --> 37:24.652
You know, I'm happy to see you.
Don't get me wrong.

37:24.786 --> 37:26.554
I just didn't know
where else to go, you know?

37:26.688 --> 37:28.322
I needed to talk to someone.

37:28.456 --> 37:31.625
You know, a guy
I could relate to.

37:31.759 --> 37:33.527
You know I'm not gay, right?

37:33.661 --> 37:35.163
I cannot move on with you
or in with you

37:35.295 --> 37:36.529
or in you, okay?

37:36.663 --> 37:37.965
- No can do, bro.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.833
I just needed
to talk to someone

37:39.967 --> 37:41.902
who might be able to tell me
what the fuck is going on.

37:42.036 --> 37:44.304
Yeah, well, hey.

37:44.438 --> 37:46.875
I'm being a crappy host here.

37:47.007 --> 37:51.346
I mean, you want something,
I don't know, to sit on, read?

37:51.478 --> 37:52.614
No, no.

37:52.748 --> 37:53.815
Want to check out
my beer collection?

37:53.949 --> 37:55.081
I have a lot.

37:55.215 --> 37:57.518
I really have everything.
You want a drink?

37:57.652 --> 38:01.755
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I had plenty.

38:01.889 --> 38:05.560
So, how is it?
You know?

38:05.692 --> 38:07.261
The boredom...
it's got to be maddening.

38:07.395 --> 38:11.666
Oh, man, it's not so bad.
I get a lot of reading done.

38:11.799 --> 38:14.703
You ever read Vonnegut?
Fucking phenomenal.

38:17.438 --> 38:19.706
God, yeah.
It's so fucking boring.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.375
- Yeah.
- You're right.

38:21.509 --> 38:22.677
I just heard myself
say that shit.

38:22.810 --> 38:25.045
I am so fucking bored.

38:25.179 --> 38:27.915
I woke up here and, like,
right off the bat, I'm like,

38:28.049 --> 38:29.684
"So when do I get
to meet Hendrix?"

38:29.817 --> 38:32.753
And, you know, Abe Lincoln?
And, you know, Farrah?

38:32.888 --> 38:35.322
I swear, first words
once I got here.

38:35.456 --> 38:36.891
My guide laughed his ass off.

38:37.025 --> 38:39.661
So why aren't you out there,

38:39.793 --> 38:41.263
you know,
trying to find someone?

38:41.395 --> 38:42.263
I mean, you know
the deal, right?

38:42.395 --> 38:43.264
It's harsh, no?

38:43.397 --> 38:44.698
Oh, man.

38:44.833 --> 38:46.835
First couple days,
I worked it like a dog,

38:46.967 --> 38:49.571
like a college freshman.
You know?

38:49.703 --> 38:52.005
I combed my goddamn hair,
I stood up straight,

38:52.139 --> 38:55.343
made sure I belched silently,
the whole deal.

38:55.476 --> 38:56.844
I tried, man.

38:56.978 --> 38:58.746
But these girls,
they've heard everything,

38:58.880 --> 39:00.748
and they couldn't settle
if they wanted to.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.650
Great, that's not
what I wanted to hear.

39:02.784 --> 39:05.820
You can't move forward
unless it's the real thing.

39:05.953 --> 39:07.455
You both got to feel true love.

39:07.589 --> 39:09.623
Got to be magic,
or nothing happens, pffft!

39:09.757 --> 39:11.759
You know, that's a high bar
to jump over.

39:11.893 --> 39:14.830
You look around, and you can
just feel the universe

39:14.962 --> 39:17.564
ignoring you.
You know, whispering like,

39:17.699 --> 39:19.701
"Nope, that ain't it,
try again."

39:19.833 --> 39:23.303
So, then you tighten up
your game, you sharpen up,

39:23.436 --> 39:26.674
and then you fail again.
And it gets worse each time

39:26.808 --> 39:28.342
because now
you can't kid yourself

39:28.476 --> 39:31.378
that you're not really trying
or you don't really care.

39:31.513 --> 39:33.648
So, we're screwed?

39:33.781 --> 39:35.582
This ain't hell,

39:35.717 --> 39:38.153
but it's sure doing
its best impression.

39:39.453 --> 39:42.456
So what do you do?

39:42.589 --> 39:44.858
Me?

39:44.991 --> 39:46.794
I watch living people
when they're naked.

39:46.927 --> 39:51.197
I watch them fuck, watch them
shower, watch them jerk off.

39:51.331 --> 39:53.467
It's hilarious, man.
It's the funniest thing ever.

39:53.601 --> 39:55.369
Yeah, funny.

39:55.502 --> 39:58.372
Isn't that like watching the
Food Channel on a liquid diet?

39:58.505 --> 39:59.839
It's not so bad.

39:59.973 --> 40:02.676
What, are you spending
your days as a peeping Tom?

40:02.810 --> 40:05.846
No, man.
A peeping Tom's gotta hide.

40:05.980 --> 40:08.949
I'm right there with
a fucking Glenlivet in my hand.

40:09.083 --> 40:10.551
You know,
just hanging out, casual,

40:10.685 --> 40:11.819
no worries in the world.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.186
What else do you do?
I mean,

40:13.321 --> 40:14.721
even that's
gotta get old eventually.

40:14.855 --> 40:17.124
Not really.
You'd be surprised.

40:17.257 --> 40:20.060
Death relieves an amazing
amount of guilt, too.

40:20.194 --> 40:21.495
And no jealousy, either.

40:21.630 --> 40:24.398
I'm very proud of myself most
of the time, I've gotta say.

40:24.531 --> 40:25.899
You must be.

40:26.034 --> 40:28.569
Man, it's got to be crazy,
right?

40:28.703 --> 40:30.772
I mean, you can't do anything.

40:30.904 --> 40:34.040
Well, I walk a lot.

40:34.174 --> 40:37.144
I drink a lot.
Plus I read a lot.

40:37.277 --> 40:39.045
You sure you don't want
something to read?

40:39.179 --> 40:41.348
Nah, I don't even know
where I'd start.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.216
You got a self-help section?

40:43.351 --> 40:45.319
Not unless smut counts.

40:45.453 --> 40:48.056
Nah, that self-improvement
crap's a dead end,

40:48.188 --> 40:49.156
no pun intended.

40:49.290 --> 40:50.958
It's the great authors
you need,

40:51.092 --> 40:55.029
literature like "Moby Dick,"
or, you know, Updike.

40:55.163 --> 40:57.398
- Yeah, why?
- Why? I don't know.

40:57.531 --> 41:00.901
You want to spend eternity
with Deepak Chopra?

41:01.034 --> 41:02.636
Once only important stuff
is important,

41:02.770 --> 41:05.674
you really can't read
joke books anymore.

41:07.540 --> 41:10.077
All right, so...

41:11.045 --> 41:13.615
Where do I go if I want to try
my luck, you know?

41:13.748 --> 41:14.949
Find a girl, you know?

41:15.083 --> 41:16.517
I can't
just give up without trying.

41:16.650 --> 41:17.985
Of course, of course.

41:18.118 --> 41:19.887
I like your motivation.
You know, we're men.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.223
We're not happy unless we try
to defeat something, right?

41:22.355 --> 41:24.257
Yeah, or at least tell
ourselves that we tried.

41:24.391 --> 41:25.960
So?

41:27.161 --> 41:32.032
Well, there's one place,
but it's not easy.

41:32.165 --> 41:34.968
It's hell on your self-esteem
and your nerves.

41:35.103 --> 41:37.172
Think you felt out of place
as the old guy in the clubs

41:37.304 --> 41:41.308
when you were alive?
This will kill you.

41:43.810 --> 41:45.112
What's that?

41:45.246 --> 41:46.647
Just a quarter.

41:46.781 --> 41:49.183
Yeah, I know what it is, but
where the fuck did you get it?

41:49.317 --> 41:51.552
I don't know,
I brought it with me.

41:51.685 --> 41:55.055
From your life?
That's fucking wild.

41:55.188 --> 41:57.491
I've never been able to carry
anything around with me

41:57.625 --> 41:59.293
but booze and books.

41:59.426 --> 42:01.696
Everything else just falls
right through my hands.

42:01.828 --> 42:03.830
Yeah, well, I died with it
in my hand.

42:03.964 --> 42:05.265
I guess I carry it around

42:05.398 --> 42:08.601
for, like, a bad luck charm
or something.

42:08.735 --> 42:09.804
All right, so you want to go?

42:09.936 --> 42:12.639
- Go?
- Yeah.

42:12.772 --> 42:14.708
Yeah, sure.

42:14.842 --> 42:16.644
You're not gonna like it.

42:16.777 --> 42:19.746
Well, I didn't eat meat...

42:19.880 --> 42:24.217
or gluten, or sugar or yeast.

42:24.351 --> 42:25.886
Let me see,
I never wore nail polish

42:26.020 --> 42:28.121
because it made me feel
claustrophobic.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.891
I think they love each other,
but they're like, "meow."

42:32.592 --> 42:33.726
You say you died alone?

42:33.860 --> 42:35.429
Uh, with my cats.

42:35.563 --> 42:38.767
But I'm not really sure
what that has to do with Jesus.

42:41.368 --> 42:43.904
I hate any movies
that are, like, set in space

42:44.038 --> 42:46.407
or foreign countries.

42:49.043 --> 42:52.180
Well, you know,
mostly I dedicated my life...

42:52.313 --> 42:55.784
it's kind of embarrassing...
to the art of ventriloquism.

42:55.917 --> 42:58.719
But, of course,
I couldn't pass over with him.

42:58.853 --> 43:01.856
But can you kind of imagine it?

43:01.989 --> 43:04.424
"You think this date's
going bad?

43:04.558 --> 43:06.828
Wait till I take you home."

43:06.960 --> 43:09.129
Wouldn't be the first hand
I've made love to.

43:09.263 --> 43:10.797
I can guess anyone's sign

43:10.931 --> 43:12.465
within the first 30 seconds
of meeting them

43:12.600 --> 43:17.672
without ever speaking to them.
You want to know how I know?

43:17.806 --> 43:18.839
No.

43:25.746 --> 43:27.281
How about those Knicks?

43:27.415 --> 43:31.250
I don't like animals.
I prefer silence to music.

43:31.384 --> 43:33.587
I have issues
with being touched,

43:33.721 --> 43:36.891
so sex has pretty much always
been out of the question,

43:37.025 --> 43:38.526
and no sex talk either.

43:38.659 --> 43:41.561
- So what do you like to do?
- My God, like, anything.

43:41.696 --> 43:44.766
I'm easy, whatever.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.808
Man, I forgot
how brutal this is.

43:55.942 --> 43:58.412
I told you.

43:59.246 --> 44:01.081
You see that girl over there?

44:01.215 --> 44:03.551
My God, I just
want to rip my dick off

44:03.683 --> 44:06.153
and throw it at her.
You know?

44:07.121 --> 44:08.689
Is that a rude thing to do?

44:08.822 --> 44:11.792
I don't even remember
the rules.

44:11.926 --> 44:13.360
Why don't you go over there
and talk to her?

44:13.493 --> 44:15.962
Nah, you kidding me?

44:16.096 --> 44:19.532
I've been shot down
more times than skeet.

44:19.667 --> 44:21.235
I just don't care anymore.

44:21.368 --> 44:24.605
I'd rather watch you beat
your head against a brick wall.

44:24.739 --> 44:26.541
Come on,
get back out there, boy.

44:26.674 --> 44:28.742
No, no, no.

44:28.875 --> 44:31.812
What about her over there?

44:32.714 --> 44:35.248
Come on, get out there.

44:35.382 --> 44:37.851
All right.

44:45.826 --> 44:47.528
Gong.
You can go.

44:47.661 --> 44:48.696
Without even talking to me?

44:48.828 --> 44:50.330
How did you decide
that so quickly?

44:50.464 --> 44:52.432
You want me to tell you
what I don't like about you?

44:52.565 --> 44:54.201
No, gong.

44:54.335 --> 44:56.203
Is that supposed to be, like,
"The Gong Show" or something?

44:56.337 --> 44:59.139
I mean, that is
some charming shit.

44:59.272 --> 45:00.907
I guess you don't
remember me.

45:01.042 --> 45:05.078
We met when we were alive and
you're a woman-hating douche.

45:05.212 --> 45:08.147
Why should us both dying
suddenly making you my type?

45:08.281 --> 45:10.583
We're done here, right?
I don't have time for you.

45:10.717 --> 45:14.154
Come on, time?
We got nothing but time.

45:14.288 --> 45:17.958
Really?
You didn't figure it out yet?

45:18.092 --> 45:21.494
Think about it.
If our time here was unlimited,

45:21.628 --> 45:24.264
this place would be crawling
with the unlovable losers

45:24.398 --> 45:25.565
from all time.

45:25.699 --> 45:29.302
You see any homely
one-legged Civil War vets

45:29.436 --> 45:32.139
wooing maidens?
This place so crowded?

45:32.272 --> 45:34.241
Time.
No, my friend.

45:34.375 --> 45:36.377
The post-biological clock
is ticking.

45:36.511 --> 45:38.411
Wake up and listen.

45:38.545 --> 45:40.414
Wait, ticking?

45:40.547 --> 45:41.881
Yeah.

45:42.016 --> 45:45.519
So loud, you can hear it where
your heartbeat used to be.

45:45.652 --> 45:47.154
How much time do we have?

45:47.288 --> 45:48.856
It's like life.
Nobody knows,

45:48.989 --> 45:51.892
and everybody gets
a different amount.

45:52.025 --> 45:53.860
What happens
if we strike out?

45:53.994 --> 45:55.897
I'll just say at least
you won't know

45:56.029 --> 45:59.100
once it's happened to you.
Or care.

46:02.569 --> 46:04.371
Hey!

46:04.505 --> 46:06.273
Scarlett!

46:07.440 --> 46:09.877
Let me in!

46:10.877 --> 46:12.278
Scarlett, where are you?

46:12.413 --> 46:14.982
I need to talk to you.
You lied to me!

46:15.114 --> 46:16.949
I know you can hear me.
Where are you?

46:17.083 --> 46:18.484
Are you listening to me?

46:19.753 --> 46:21.889
Where are you, Scarlett?

46:23.456 --> 46:26.060
Mommy, what's wrong
with Roger?

46:26.194 --> 46:27.494
You hear me?

46:27.627 --> 46:30.964
Come on, bark!
I can bug this dog all day!

46:31.098 --> 46:33.601
Come out here, Scarlett!
I've got to talk to you!

46:33.735 --> 46:35.936
Aaah!
Arf, arf!

46:36.069 --> 46:37.236
It doesn't work
like this, Michael.

46:37.371 --> 46:39.139
You're not supposed
to summon me.

46:39.272 --> 46:41.174
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
wait for you to just roll up

46:41.308 --> 46:43.543
whenever you're ready.
I need to talk to you.

46:43.677 --> 46:46.213
You have all
the information you need.

46:46.346 --> 46:48.882
Yeah, I do now,
but you lied to me.

46:50.451 --> 46:53.186
Oh, shit!
That was awesome.

46:53.319 --> 46:54.520
You must have owned a car
in your life.

46:54.654 --> 46:55.889
It was her time.

46:56.023 --> 46:57.292
I never said you had
all the time in the world.

46:57.424 --> 46:59.926
No, a lie of omission
is still a lie.

47:02.462 --> 47:03.897
Excuse me, you didn't even

47:04.031 --> 47:05.998
see fit to tell me
that there's a deadline?

47:06.132 --> 47:07.368
You'd have done things
differently?

47:07.502 --> 47:09.170
Uh, yeah, I would have done

47:09.302 --> 47:11.906
just about everything
differently, and you know it.

47:12.038 --> 47:13.440
That's why I didn't tell you.

47:13.574 --> 47:17.545
It's easier if you focus
on the search and nothing more.

47:17.677 --> 47:18.980
That's how it works.

47:19.112 --> 47:21.348
So I suggest you get on
with it as best you can.

47:21.482 --> 47:24.250
Okay, okay,
so what exactly happens

47:24.384 --> 47:27.422
if I don't find a soul mate?
What, do I burn in hell?

47:27.554 --> 47:29.656
Don't be childish.

47:29.790 --> 47:31.625
I'll be with you in a moment.

47:32.893 --> 47:34.561
Then what?

47:34.694 --> 47:36.963
Nothing, nothing at all.

47:37.098 --> 47:39.366
Nothing?
Then what's the point?

47:39.500 --> 47:41.201
What's the point of anything?

47:41.335 --> 47:44.505
Nothing happens.
You cease to exist,

47:44.638 --> 47:47.674
and the world goes on
without you as always.

47:47.808 --> 47:49.543
I mean, how do I know
someone's my soul mate

47:49.676 --> 47:53.681
if I've never been to Venezuela
or Singapore or Queens?

47:53.815 --> 47:57.284
Once I write the ticket,
I'm not allowed to void it.

47:57.418 --> 48:00.621
You can fight it
with the info on the back.

48:00.753 --> 48:04.491
Once I write the ticket,
I'm not allowed to void it.

48:05.726 --> 48:07.061
You can write it...

48:07.194 --> 48:09.163
You meet a girl,
fall in love.

48:09.297 --> 48:11.532
It's that simple.

48:11.665 --> 48:13.734
How am I supposed
to meet a girl?

48:13.868 --> 48:15.402
Life is like that, isn't it?

48:15.536 --> 48:18.772
Full of complications,
no explanations.

48:18.906 --> 48:21.275
Death is too, only more so.

48:21.409 --> 48:24.345
Life is easier,
but you couldn't make it work,

48:24.478 --> 48:27.047
so you have a second chance.

48:27.181 --> 48:30.284
One last second chance,

48:30.417 --> 48:31.585
and you're complaining
about it?

48:31.719 --> 48:33.921
Well, it's meaningless
and arbitrary.

48:34.054 --> 48:37.558
No.
It makes allowances for magic.

48:37.692 --> 48:40.226
Magic?
Are you fucking shitting me?

48:40.360 --> 48:42.362
The point is to meet someone

48:42.496 --> 48:45.433
who sparks something
within you.

48:45.565 --> 48:47.067
Two become one.

48:47.201 --> 48:50.003
Only paired souls progress.

48:50.138 --> 48:54.308
Love allows you to spend
forever with someone.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.810
That is what love is.

48:55.942 --> 48:58.978
Okay, so then what happens
to the single losers?

48:59.112 --> 49:01.315
They spend eternity
not existing.

49:01.449 --> 49:03.717
You both have to fall in love,
or nothing.

49:03.851 --> 49:05.920
It's hardly fair.

49:06.052 --> 49:07.288
Little secret.

49:07.422 --> 49:09.857
The universe is not fair.
It's just big.

49:09.991 --> 49:13.159
Okay, I don't get how
the universe supposedly knows

49:13.293 --> 49:14.595
and decides the difference.

49:14.728 --> 49:18.132
The universe
doesn't decide anything.

49:18.264 --> 49:23.469
Love just is, and its existence
causes a reaction.

49:23.603 --> 49:28.040
It's like life or pregnancy.
It is or it isn't.

49:28.174 --> 49:30.110
No one decides anything.

49:31.212 --> 49:32.513
Am I getting on your nerves?

49:32.645 --> 49:34.113
Well, you do ask
a lot of questions.

49:34.248 --> 49:36.083
I have a lot of questions.

49:36.217 --> 49:38.051
Who did you ask
before you met me?

49:46.759 --> 49:49.763
Is there any way he can
see me for just five minutes?

49:49.897 --> 49:52.333
It's not that simple.

49:56.036 --> 49:57.938
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

49:58.071 --> 49:59.505
Can you hear me?

49:59.639 --> 50:01.908
I know, but I'm telling you,
I can get you any of it.

50:02.043 --> 50:03.210
Right, right.

50:03.344 --> 50:04.511
I'm sitting on a ton of stuff:

50:04.645 --> 50:06.848
tapes, monologues,
whatever you can sell.

50:07.647 --> 50:08.648
Yeah, sure.

50:08.781 --> 50:10.283
Well, this all goes cold
when the body does,

50:10.418 --> 50:12.820
so I'm looking at all offers.

50:13.719 --> 50:15.188
'Course the one-man show
is closed.

50:15.322 --> 50:18.025
He's in the ground.
It's a one-man show.

50:18.157 --> 50:19.625
Yeah.
He wrote it, he directed it.

50:19.759 --> 50:21.928
I'm the one
sitting on the pile of gold.

50:22.563 --> 50:24.765
No, I'm not saying
he was famous.

50:24.897 --> 50:26.866
He wasn't James Dean,
but neither was James Dean

50:27.000 --> 50:29.069
until he got in the Porsche.

50:29.203 --> 50:30.838
All right, who have you
got in mind?

50:30.971 --> 50:33.473
What would that take,
between you and me?

50:33.607 --> 50:35.909
No, no, I agree.
He's a terrific actor.

50:36.043 --> 50:37.545
He would be perfect
if he's interested.

50:37.677 --> 50:39.746
You recast my show
before I'm even cold?

50:39.880 --> 50:41.915
You're not serious.

50:42.715 --> 50:44.518
I so wish I could piss
in that right now.

50:44.650 --> 50:47.253
Yeah, we wait two weeks
just for appearances,

50:47.386 --> 50:48.522
then we announce.

50:48.656 --> 50:50.424
Four weeks
if you feel feelings.

50:50.556 --> 50:52.959
Yeah, get the wheels in motion,
or somebody else will.

50:53.094 --> 50:54.895
Yeah, all right.
Bye.

50:55.029 --> 50:57.297
Get me Amy on the phone, Pam.

50:57.431 --> 51:00.168
What the hell?
You've got to be kidding me!

51:01.967 --> 51:04.205
Amy, hey.

51:10.344 --> 51:12.713
Nice. I knew
I'd find you here.

51:12.846 --> 51:15.516
If you're waiting for me
to act all embarrassed,

51:15.650 --> 51:17.351
you might want
to pull up a comfy chair.

51:17.484 --> 51:18.518
It's gonna be a while.

51:18.652 --> 51:21.521
My sense of shame died
when I did.

51:21.654 --> 51:23.422
So tell me about the rules.

51:23.556 --> 51:25.091
You've got to be kidding me.

51:25.225 --> 51:26.694
How's this for a rule?

51:26.826 --> 51:29.061
If there really is eternal life
and you can't just sit here

51:29.196 --> 51:30.563
and enjoy your invisibility,

51:30.697 --> 51:32.499
then you're not gonna want
to be part of it anyway.

51:32.632 --> 51:35.101
No, no, I'm talking about
the rules about what we can

51:35.235 --> 51:37.271
and cannot do
and how long we have

51:37.404 --> 51:39.072
and what we got to do
to make it all work

51:39.206 --> 51:40.307
to... you know, to go on.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.076
Bro, are you seeing all this?

51:42.210 --> 51:44.545
Angelo, I don't have
time to...

51:44.677 --> 51:46.147
Jesus.

51:46.279 --> 51:48.482
He's not here right now.

51:48.614 --> 51:52.218
Oh, yeah, Jesus.

51:52.353 --> 51:53.686
I am not afraid of you.

51:53.819 --> 51:56.489
Oh my God, I cannot stop
staring at that ass.

51:56.623 --> 51:59.493
It's like a magnetic force.

51:59.625 --> 52:01.728
Black hole
just sucking in all the light.

52:01.862 --> 52:03.530
Yeah, there's a black hole
all right.

52:03.663 --> 52:06.600
I bet you can hear the ocean
in that thing.

52:06.734 --> 52:08.802
Okay, that's a little gross.

52:08.935 --> 52:10.302
Okay, I'm starting
to get a feel

52:10.436 --> 52:13.406
of why you're still here,
Angelo.

52:13.540 --> 52:14.641
I'll tell you the only thing

52:14.775 --> 52:17.478
I've learned here
so far if you want.

52:17.610 --> 52:21.047
All right, yeah.
Yeah, I'll take that, shoot.

52:21.181 --> 52:22.983
It's bigger than it sounds.

52:23.116 --> 52:25.484
Yeah, that's what she said.

52:25.618 --> 52:26.619
No, come on, shoot.

52:26.752 --> 52:29.455
We're actors, Michael,
artists.

52:29.589 --> 52:31.725
I mean, the world
may remember us or miss us

52:31.857 --> 52:33.526
and may be glad
that we were here,

52:33.659 --> 52:36.730
but it isn't gonna ever
really need us for anything.

52:36.864 --> 52:38.999
I'm not sure I need
to go to the other side.

52:39.132 --> 52:41.802
You sure you do?

52:41.935 --> 52:43.503
I didn't know we had
to be needed

52:43.636 --> 52:46.172
any more than a fireman
or a plumber or a fish

52:46.306 --> 52:48.675
does to be in an afterlife.

52:48.808 --> 52:51.244
I'd like to try anyway, right?

52:51.378 --> 52:53.581
Well, knock yourself out.

52:53.714 --> 52:56.282
Me, I'm gonna spend
my last days

52:56.417 --> 52:58.451
watching that chick's ass
clench and unclench

52:58.585 --> 53:01.288
as she brushes her hair
all day.

53:01.422 --> 53:02.690
I win.

53:02.822 --> 53:06.594
Yeah, I mean,
I guess while I'm here,

53:06.726 --> 53:10.062
why not just stick around
for a while, right?

53:10.197 --> 53:12.165
Seriously, man.

53:12.299 --> 53:15.101
Where else've got to go?

53:15.235 --> 53:17.438
Who else you got left?

53:39.292 --> 53:40.828
<i>That's so weird.</i>

53:40.960 --> 53:44.631
<i>So all the little critters
can see the dead?</i>

53:45.532 --> 53:48.467
<i>I do not get the rules
of this shit yet.</i>

53:48.601 --> 53:51.538
<i>They said I could go anywhere
in the world that I wanted.</i>

53:51.672 --> 53:54.675
<i>Money's no object now,
not worth a dime.</i>

53:54.808 --> 53:58.612
<i>Even a dime isn't worth
a dime now.</i>

53:58.746 --> 54:03.150
<i>I'm a dime that's not worth
ten cents anymore.</i>

54:03.284 --> 54:04.818
<i>There's nothing between me</i>

54:04.951 --> 54:08.421
<i>and the vastness
of all eternity at this point.</i>

54:08.556 --> 54:11.792
<i>Time finally feels finite
for me,</i>

54:11.926 --> 54:15.096
<i>but I guess it always was.</i>

54:15.228 --> 54:19.565
<i>And yet,
I sit, and I waste time.</i>

54:19.699 --> 54:22.835
<i>So which is better?</i>

54:22.969 --> 54:25.638
<i>Savoring it in the sunshine,
or working my ass off</i>

54:25.772 --> 54:28.942
<i>for a goal
I may never reach anyway?</i>

54:29.076 --> 54:31.779
<i>Is a dog smart for laying
in the sun for all its days,</i>

54:31.911 --> 54:35.882
<i>or does he really just lick
his balls because he can?</i>

54:36.016 --> 54:38.185
<i>That's the question, right?</i>

54:38.317 --> 54:42.955
<i>Oh, God, I hope
they can't hear my thoughts.</i>

54:45.058 --> 54:49.128
Okay, whoever
or whatever you are,

54:49.261 --> 54:51.030
you want to allow for magic?

54:51.163 --> 54:53.499
Well, I'm gonna walk
in a random direction

54:53.634 --> 54:54.967
and go to the first place
that I see.

54:55.101 --> 54:57.705
I don't care
if it's a freaking Taco Bell.

54:57.837 --> 55:01.040
Heads East Side,
tails West Side.

55:01.942 --> 55:03.110
Heads.

55:07.114 --> 55:08.282
God.

55:46.018 --> 55:48.654
Shit, you're not dead.
Great.

55:48.788 --> 55:50.858
That's your opening line?

55:53.761 --> 55:56.897
Excuse me?

55:58.665 --> 56:00.234
You can hear me and see me?

56:00.366 --> 56:02.435
What were you looking for?

56:02.569 --> 56:06.339
Uh, I was just looking
to meet a girl.

56:06.473 --> 56:08.542
Any girl?

56:08.674 --> 56:10.476
I guess so.

56:10.610 --> 56:12.946
Well, they don't see you,
but I can.

56:13.080 --> 56:16.250
- Okay, you're confusing me.
- I know.

56:16.382 --> 56:18.484
You've got that faraway look
in your eyes.

56:18.618 --> 56:20.286
Like a...

56:20.420 --> 56:22.556
Like a dog humping a leg.

56:23.956 --> 56:26.292
So...

56:26.427 --> 56:28.528
You know I'm dead,

56:28.661 --> 56:30.196
but you don't seem surprised.

56:30.331 --> 56:33.968
I mean, how can you see me?

56:34.101 --> 56:36.703
Well...

56:36.837 --> 56:39.172
I guess
I'm very intuitive.

56:40.339 --> 56:43.910
I've been seeing this stuff
a lot lately.

56:47.246 --> 56:50.350
Why are you here?

56:50.484 --> 56:53.819
Well, I died
alone, apparently.

56:53.953 --> 56:56.522
Why did you die alone?

56:56.656 --> 57:00.159
I was picky, really picky.

57:00.293 --> 57:04.131
Yeah, I was single a lot.

57:04.264 --> 57:05.798
Weren't you lonely?

57:05.931 --> 57:09.235
I was.
Yes, I was lonely.

57:09.369 --> 57:11.804
And why are you still alone?

57:11.938 --> 57:13.440
You know, I could ask you
the same question.

57:13.574 --> 57:16.109
Well, you could, but I'm not
the one who's dead.

57:18.545 --> 57:20.147
But you are alone.
I mean...

57:20.279 --> 57:22.248
Why are you alone today,
for instance?

57:22.382 --> 57:24.884
Because my friend Faith
is always late.

57:25.018 --> 57:26.552
She's probably gonna text me
any second

57:26.686 --> 57:31.991
to say she can't make it,
because she always does that.

57:32.125 --> 57:34.060
Yeah, but if she wasn't late,

57:34.194 --> 57:37.364
I mean,
you would have never met me.

57:37.498 --> 57:39.566
True.

57:39.699 --> 57:41.701
Wow.
You can see me.

57:41.835 --> 57:44.638
Okay, what else do you see?

57:44.770 --> 57:47.640
I see you, and I see

57:47.775 --> 57:51.811
shifty little flickers
of people

57:51.944 --> 57:53.980
in the corner of my eyes.

57:55.482 --> 57:59.719
Wow.
I mean, that's lucky.

57:59.853 --> 58:01.154
You're lucky.

58:01.286 --> 58:03.290
I mean, I didn't see
any of that when I was alive.

58:03.424 --> 58:05.659
I don't know if it's lucky.

58:05.793 --> 58:09.597
I mean, maybe, maybe.
Or maybe I'm cursed.

58:12.799 --> 58:14.768
You know how people say
you find someone

58:14.900 --> 58:16.902
when you stop looking?

58:17.036 --> 58:18.705
Well, that means
I'm officially screwed,

58:18.839 --> 58:21.775
because if I don't find anyone,
I am gone eternally.

58:21.907 --> 58:23.543
I mean,
I can never stop looking.

58:23.677 --> 58:25.679
Can you find a way
to stop looking?

58:25.811 --> 58:27.781
Okay, well, how do I do that?

58:27.913 --> 58:31.250
Well, maybe think
about something else?

58:31.384 --> 58:32.519
Like what?

58:32.652 --> 58:34.821
I don't know.
Like...

58:34.953 --> 58:36.389
Do you like baseball?

58:36.522 --> 58:37.956
I love baseball.
You?

58:38.090 --> 58:42.061
- Of course not.
- That figures.

58:44.663 --> 58:46.532
You're good at this.

58:46.665 --> 58:48.133
So, I guess
we're not soul mates,

58:48.268 --> 58:50.570
or else we'd be whisked away
into the sky

58:50.703 --> 58:52.272
or something like that?

58:52.404 --> 58:55.508
Yeah, we're not soul mates.
Sorry, it's not gonna work.

58:55.641 --> 58:56.908
What, you think even
the universe

58:57.043 --> 58:58.678
thinks you're too good for me?

58:58.811 --> 59:01.949
Well, because I'm alive
and you're dead.

59:03.215 --> 59:05.018
Yeah.

59:16.862 --> 59:18.866
Be right back.

59:22.735 --> 59:24.371
Ugh.

59:24.503 --> 59:26.005
Either somebody's
fucking with you,

59:26.139 --> 59:28.275
or you really do have
the worst luck.

59:30.076 --> 59:33.413
Couldn't meet a nice dead girl
like normal people.

59:52.331 --> 59:54.268
All right.

59:57.804 --> 59:58.972
Such a New York cliché,

59:59.105 --> 01:00:02.442
spending the afterlife
haunting dive bars.

01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:10.250
Yeah, no, I'm just trying
to think this all through.

01:00:10.384 --> 01:00:12.685
- You think too much.
- Really?

01:00:12.819 --> 01:00:14.321
Yeah.

01:00:14.453 --> 01:00:16.388
Why don't you focus
on what you're here for?

01:00:16.522 --> 01:00:18.357
I just don't get it.
I mean, why can you hear me?

01:00:18.491 --> 01:00:19.993
Why can you see me?
Why do you understand this?

01:00:20.125 --> 01:00:22.361
I don't get it either,
trust me.

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:25.766
I've just been seeing
this stuff a lot lately.

01:00:25.898 --> 01:00:28.067
I see it fleetingly.

01:00:28.201 --> 01:00:29.769
But, believe it or not,
I've never struck up

01:00:29.902 --> 01:00:31.971
a conversation
with one of you before.

01:00:32.105 --> 01:00:35.308
Yeah, but...
I just...

01:00:35.442 --> 01:00:36.743
You don't seem like the kind
of woman

01:00:36.877 --> 01:00:38.578
who would be alone, either.

01:00:38.712 --> 01:00:39.980
I mean, it just
doesn't make sense.

01:00:40.112 --> 01:00:41.179
You mean, like,
what's wrong with me?

01:00:41.313 --> 01:00:42.815
Yeah, yeah.
What's wrong with you?

01:00:42.949 --> 01:00:45.519
Well, maybe I'm alone
because I'm picky.

01:00:46.552 --> 01:00:50.991
And I'm picky because I'm
looking for something magical.

01:00:56.563 --> 01:00:58.965
And I'm...

01:00:59.866 --> 01:01:04.371
I'm kind of,
sort of... being stalked.

01:01:05.971 --> 01:01:08.241
Come again?

01:01:11.545 --> 01:01:12.612
By who?

01:01:12.746 --> 01:01:17.284
Who?
This guy...

01:01:18.018 --> 01:01:19.452
His name's Patrick.

01:01:19.585 --> 01:01:22.589
And all I ever did
was have dinner with him once,

01:01:22.723 --> 01:01:25.190
and I told him
I didn't want to be with him.

01:01:25.324 --> 01:01:28.527
He said that he could wait
for me,

01:01:28.661 --> 01:01:32.364
and he sends me weird emails,

01:01:32.498 --> 01:01:35.400
watches me from a distance,
follows me everywhere I go.

01:01:35.534 --> 01:01:37.369
He makes every guy
I talk to uncomfortable.

01:01:37.503 --> 01:01:38.739
Yeah.

01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:40.339
I'm getting uncomfortable
just hearing this.

01:01:40.473 --> 01:01:43.177
I mean, why did you have dinner
with him in the first place?

01:01:44.177 --> 01:01:46.479
Because he was my boss
at the time,

01:01:46.612 --> 01:01:48.748
and he was nice
in the beginning.

01:01:48.882 --> 01:01:50.850
I can understand
that, I guess.

01:01:50.982 --> 01:01:52.985
Okay, so, where is he?
Is he here?

01:01:53.118 --> 01:01:54.887
No, I hope not.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.090
I managed to lose him
in the subway.

01:01:58.223 --> 01:01:59.792
Anyway, can we talk
about something else?

01:01:59.926 --> 01:02:02.061
Sure, okay.
I know guys like that.

01:02:02.194 --> 01:02:05.030
I always try to not be one.
You know?

01:02:05.165 --> 01:02:09.136
I walk away if I buy a girl
a drink, you know?

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:11.036
Because I don't want to be
the kind of guy that thinks

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:13.072
that the girl necessarily wants
to talk to him all night

01:02:13.206 --> 01:02:15.208
just because he's being polite.

01:02:15.342 --> 01:02:16.976
You know, I buy her a drink.

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:19.613
Doesn't mean you owe me one.

01:02:19.746 --> 01:02:21.381
Doesn't mean I'm in.

01:02:21.514 --> 01:02:24.282
You're such a hero.

01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:28.520
Ah, what a time
to find myself dead.

01:02:28.654 --> 01:02:31.557
You know, I was even late
for my own funeral.

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:35.060
My dad always says
I have natural bad timing.

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:41.301
That's really nice,
but I don't understand you.

01:02:41.433 --> 01:02:43.136
I know.

01:02:45.038 --> 01:02:47.840
I'm Michael.
What's your name?

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.141
Honey Bee.

01:02:49.275 --> 01:02:50.410
Okay, if you don't want
to tell me,

01:02:50.543 --> 01:02:52.744
you can just say so.
I know we just met.

01:02:52.878 --> 01:02:53.913
You don't believe me?

01:02:54.045 --> 01:02:55.314
I don't believe you.

01:02:55.447 --> 01:02:57.350
You want to see
my birth certificate?

01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:58.384
You know what?

01:02:58.518 --> 01:02:59.686
Actually, I was gonna guess
that name.

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:01.153
Oh, yeah?

01:03:01.288 --> 01:03:03.121
Did you have a crazy nickname
growing up

01:03:03.255 --> 01:03:04.456
like "Lisa" or "Susan"?

01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:05.491
No.

01:03:05.625 --> 01:03:07.827
So, everybody calls you
"Honey Bee"?

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.228
Honey Bee.

01:03:09.362 --> 01:03:12.532
I mean, my mom
calls me "honey" or "bee."

01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:14.132
And my dad calls me "HB."

01:03:14.266 --> 01:03:17.236
So your parents were WASPs?

01:03:19.339 --> 01:03:20.139
Bad joke.

01:03:20.272 --> 01:03:21.907
Terrible joke.

01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.976
Sorry.

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:26.145
What do you do, Honey Bee?

01:03:26.279 --> 01:03:29.014
Uff, I hate that question.

01:03:29.148 --> 01:03:30.215
What?
Come on, I'm dead.

01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:32.085
What, am I gonna judge you?

01:03:32.217 --> 01:03:34.353
What about you?
What did you do?

01:03:34.487 --> 01:03:37.223
Most of the time,
I was an actor,

01:03:37.357 --> 01:03:40.393
and I spent years developing
this one-man show.

01:03:40.527 --> 01:03:41.594
Don't laugh, okay?

01:03:41.728 --> 01:03:43.496
It was gonna be,
like, the first non-shitty one

01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:46.465
in like forever, okay.
And it was...

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.701
It was gonna open soon.

01:03:48.835 --> 01:03:50.003
I was also a waiter.

01:03:50.136 --> 01:03:53.439
Yeah, because that's the law
for actors.

01:03:53.572 --> 01:03:56.042
Why don't you want to talk
about what you do?

01:03:56.174 --> 01:03:59.511
Because it's...

01:03:59.645 --> 01:04:00.913
another New York cliché.

01:04:01.047 --> 01:04:03.715
Nah, come on.
Hit me.

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:08.121
Well, basically,
I do three things.

01:04:08.253 --> 01:04:10.889
I work at an office.

01:04:11.023 --> 01:04:12.357
I, uh...

01:04:12.491 --> 01:04:13.792
No, sorry.
Just kidding.

01:04:13.927 --> 01:04:15.328
That's not nice!

01:04:15.462 --> 01:04:16.862
It's a joke,
another bad joke.

01:04:16.996 --> 01:04:21.032
The worst joke ever.
It's the worst joke ever.

01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:24.136
Never mind,
what else did you do?

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:27.506
I'm a dog walker.
I walk dogs.

01:04:27.639 --> 01:04:28.975
- Oh.
- Okay?

01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:30.944
I even walked
David Bowie's dogs once.

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:33.412
- No.
- Yeah, now you're interested.

01:04:33.547 --> 01:04:35.115
- I am interested.
- Yeah.

01:04:35.248 --> 01:04:37.884
- What was his name?
- His name was Mickey.

01:04:38.018 --> 01:04:40.753
He was really ugly, ugly dog.

01:04:40.886 --> 01:04:42.955
Wow.
So, you work in an office

01:04:43.089 --> 01:04:44.357
- and you walk dogs?
- Yeah.

01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:46.859
- What else do you do?
- And I do...

01:04:46.993 --> 01:04:48.427
That I do it on the side.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.295
I don't really make
a living right now out of it.

01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:52.130
- Well...
- I'm a photographer.

01:04:52.264 --> 01:04:54.034
That's my passion.

01:04:54.167 --> 01:04:55.402
Okay, so you know what?

01:04:55.534 --> 01:04:59.004
To me, you're a photographer
that walks dogs.

01:04:59.138 --> 01:05:01.574
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:09.248 --> 01:05:12.051
My friend
just canceled on me.

01:05:12.185 --> 01:05:14.219
I mean, she's not coming.

01:05:14.353 --> 01:05:16.188
Do you want to...

01:05:16.322 --> 01:05:18.625
Do you want to...

01:05:18.757 --> 01:05:21.426
get out of here?

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.594
Yeah...

01:05:22.728 --> 01:05:24.330
I hope you don't mean that
as a euphemism,

01:05:24.464 --> 01:05:26.498
because I will
severely disappoint you.

01:05:27.567 --> 01:05:30.237
Come on, let me show you
something amazing.

01:05:40.313 --> 01:05:42.816
Got to admit, I expected
Eiffel Tower,

01:05:42.949 --> 01:05:45.017
pyramids, Taj Mahal.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.053
- You want to try it?
- Ha, yeah.

01:05:48.186 --> 01:05:49.656
Would if I could.

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:52.324
Guess that's easy
to say, right?

01:05:53.058 --> 01:05:54.060
You?

01:05:54.192 --> 01:05:55.594
No way.

01:05:55.728 --> 01:05:58.330
What if I fall and there's
no one there to catch me?

01:05:58.464 --> 01:06:00.465
That's what the net's for.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.302
You never know if anyone's
gonna be there to catch you.

01:06:02.435 --> 01:06:04.937
I mean, pfft.
That's life, girl.

01:06:05.071 --> 01:06:06.605
You're a little cynical,
aren't you?

01:06:06.739 --> 01:06:09.810
Yeah, you see how optimistic
you are when you're dead.

01:06:12.078 --> 01:06:13.380
You know what?
Scratch that.

01:06:13.513 --> 01:06:14.813
That sounded way better
in my head.

01:06:14.947 --> 01:06:16.850
I'm sure.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:20.786
Did you ever jump out
of an airplane?

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.755
No, no.

01:06:22.889 --> 01:06:26.325
I always figured
I would, though, you know?

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:28.161
I've been killed by a truck.

01:06:28.295 --> 01:06:31.031
That's got to be, like,
half credit, right?

01:06:31.163 --> 01:06:32.831
You?

01:06:32.965 --> 01:06:35.234
Never.

01:06:35.368 --> 01:06:38.705
Would've been nice
to do it with you.

01:06:42.275 --> 01:06:44.277
Scratch that, sounded
way better in my head.

01:06:48.947 --> 01:06:50.783
Why me?

01:06:52.853 --> 01:06:56.055
I don't know.
Why not?

01:06:56.188 --> 01:06:57.422
You want to get out of here?

01:06:57.556 --> 01:06:59.658
I mean, unless one
of these guys falls,

01:06:59.792 --> 01:07:01.594
I think we've seen
all this has to offer.

01:07:01.728 --> 01:07:03.563
Are you worried
a new dead guy will show up

01:07:03.697 --> 01:07:06.032
- and sweep me off my feet?
- Yeah, a little.

01:07:06.165 --> 01:07:08.434
That net looks flimsy,
like it could dice someone.

01:07:08.567 --> 01:07:10.603
Come on, take a walk?

01:07:10.737 --> 01:07:12.638
Take a walk.

01:07:12.772 --> 01:07:14.607
Take a walk.

01:07:29.288 --> 01:07:30.924
Hey, look.

01:07:31.056 --> 01:07:33.659
There goes "stressing out about
her yoga relaxation seminar."

01:07:33.793 --> 01:07:35.795
She doesn't seem
really stressed out.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:37.096
She seems, like, mad.

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:39.099
Everybody's stressed out
in New York.

01:07:39.232 --> 01:07:41.835
- Are you stressed out?
- Not anymore.

01:07:43.402 --> 01:07:45.904
I'm hungry.
Are you hungry?

01:07:46.038 --> 01:07:47.139
I think you're amazing,

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:50.508
but I can't take you out
to dinner

01:07:50.643 --> 01:07:52.845
or back to my place
or any place.

01:07:52.978 --> 01:07:54.446
I don't really have a place.

01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:56.148
So where do you live?

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.884
Everywhere and nowhere.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.857
Hey, um...

01:08:03.989 --> 01:08:06.359
Have you ever been married?

01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:08.393
That's a pretty
straightforward question.

01:08:08.527 --> 01:08:10.829
Well, I'm a straightforward
kind of guy.

01:08:11.664 --> 01:08:16.201
Well, I've been close enough
to know I'm not really a fan.

01:08:16.335 --> 01:08:20.206
- You?
- Same, yeah.

01:08:27.412 --> 01:08:29.982
It's really dark in here.
Probably get mugged.

01:08:30.115 --> 01:08:31.082
And I can't help you.

01:08:31.216 --> 01:08:33.953
Sorry.

01:08:34.087 --> 01:08:35.154
Bad joke.

01:08:35.287 --> 01:08:37.490
- Anyways...
- Horrible joke.

01:08:38.423 --> 01:08:40.694
What kind of music do you like?

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:42.995
Oh, good question.

01:08:43.129 --> 01:08:47.834
I like everything
from hard rock to folk.

01:08:47.966 --> 01:08:49.801
I like anything rich
with feeling.

01:08:49.935 --> 01:08:51.404
Genuine, true.

01:08:51.537 --> 01:08:54.340
I like it raw.
How about you?

01:08:54.473 --> 01:08:57.877
Oh, I'm the opposite.
Zero feeling whatsoever.

01:08:58.812 --> 01:09:02.082
Oh, you're joking, okay.
Ha, ha, I get it.

01:09:02.214 --> 01:09:03.615
- "Ha, ha"!
- I get it.

01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:05.050
What kind of answer is that?
Come on.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.185
What, you want a list?

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:07.652
Yeah, of course
I want a list.

01:09:07.786 --> 01:09:12.290
Okay, okay.
I like Beatles, Stones, Dylan.

01:09:12.424 --> 01:09:16.694
- I love Dylan.
- Ramones, Marilyn Manson.

01:09:16.828 --> 01:09:21.399
- Marilyn Manson?
- Yeah, Joni, Johnny Cash.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:22.935
How about you?

01:09:23.069 --> 01:09:24.670
The Beatles.

01:09:26.106 --> 01:09:27.639
- Is that it?
- Yep.

01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:30.441
To me, everything comes
back to the Beatles.

01:09:30.575 --> 01:09:33.745
All right.
Guess that's all you need.

01:09:33.879 --> 01:09:36.482
Hey, look.

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:40.687
Dakota Building.

01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:42.621
Yes, indeed.

01:09:42.755 --> 01:09:45.491
Can you believe Yoko
still lives there?

01:09:46.392 --> 01:09:47.594
Like so many years later,

01:09:47.727 --> 01:09:50.328
she has to walk
past that tragedy every day.

01:09:50.462 --> 01:09:52.231
- It's crazy.
- Yeah, it is crazy.

01:09:52.365 --> 01:09:53.899
I never
really thought about it.

01:09:54.033 --> 01:09:55.168
Be like if Jackie O had

01:09:55.302 --> 01:09:57.770
an apartment
at the Book Depository.

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:03.942
Do you think Yoko's
still the same person she was?

01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:06.846
You know, after 30 years,

01:10:06.978 --> 01:10:09.315
after losing
the great love of her life?

01:10:09.449 --> 01:10:13.820
Of course she is.
Yoko will always be Yoko.

01:10:14.853 --> 01:10:17.356
What do you think
she's doing?

01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:19.892
What do you mean?
Right now?

01:10:20.026 --> 01:10:21.828
Yeah.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.795
I don't know.

01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:27.534
Pretty sure
she's doing something amazing.

01:10:35.574 --> 01:10:37.911
How does it feel like?

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:42.214
- What, being dead?
- Yeah.

01:10:42.347 --> 01:10:45.250
Do you feel like
cold, weightless?

01:10:45.384 --> 01:10:48.553
No, no, I don't feel
anything at all.

01:10:48.687 --> 01:10:51.623
That's the weird part.
I don't feel anything.

01:10:51.757 --> 01:10:56.562
I don't feel hot or cold,
tired, horny.

01:10:56.695 --> 01:10:58.097
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:10:58.231 --> 01:10:59.665
You know what it's like?

01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:04.203
It's like being outside
a giant restaurant window

01:11:04.337 --> 01:11:07.240
and watching
everybody else eat.

01:11:07.373 --> 01:11:08.941
It's like fucking the world

01:11:09.074 --> 01:11:11.710
through three
really thick condoms.

01:11:11.843 --> 01:11:15.114
- That's a good image.
- Yeah.

01:11:15.248 --> 01:11:19.119
I used to feel so much
when I was alive, you know.

01:11:20.285 --> 01:11:23.789
Sometimes life was too much.

01:11:23.923 --> 01:11:27.927
It could be love, it could be
happiness, nostalgia.

01:11:29.061 --> 01:11:33.767
Feeling someone else's pain,
someone else's sadness.

01:11:35.133 --> 01:11:36.801
I could look at a dog
not understand

01:11:36.936 --> 01:11:38.438
why it was being spanked,

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:41.373
and that feeling
would overwhelm me, you know?

01:11:41.508 --> 01:11:45.978
A D-minor chord could just
make me break down and cry.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.549
You're such a pussy.

01:11:53.718 --> 01:11:58.490
And what about now?
Like, you don't feel anything?

01:11:58.624 --> 01:12:00.627
Well, right now...

01:12:00.759 --> 01:12:05.397
The only thing I can feel
is drunk and way drunker.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:08.600
And...

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:14.474
I feel something for you.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.878
From you.

01:12:22.514 --> 01:12:25.017
What do you feel from me?

01:12:27.419 --> 01:12:28.888
Not quite sure.

01:12:29.021 --> 01:12:32.523
Trying to put my finger on it.

01:12:48.106 --> 01:12:49.708
What would you like
to feel most

01:12:49.842 --> 01:12:53.946
if you could choose
to feel anything?

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:56.215
Don't say me.

01:12:57.615 --> 01:13:01.186
Okay, don't laugh.

01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:06.558
That tingling feeling you get
when someone you love

01:13:06.692 --> 01:13:09.695
is thinking
about you from far away.

01:13:10.996 --> 01:13:16.936
You know, that connection
when a girl is missing you.

01:13:20.606 --> 01:13:22.141
Any girl?

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:34.954
Hey, watch it.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.302
Sorry I made you cross
between those two cars.

01:13:50.435 --> 01:13:52.737
Huh? What'd you say?

01:13:52.871 --> 01:13:54.240
Where do you live, here?

01:13:54.373 --> 01:13:57.610
- Yeah, right here. Fuck.
- What's the matter?

01:13:57.744 --> 01:13:58.978
It's him.

01:13:59.111 --> 01:14:00.445
Hey, Honey Bee.
I just want to talk.

01:14:00.579 --> 01:14:01.746
Patrick, I asked you not
to come here.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.081
It makes me
really uncomfortable.

01:14:03.214 --> 01:14:05.784
As you can see,
I'm with someone right now.

01:14:06.584 --> 01:14:08.553
Uhh?

01:14:08.687 --> 01:14:10.623
I mean, I'm meeting
someone, okay?

01:14:10.757 --> 01:14:12.225
- Can I...
- Well, that's totally okay.

01:14:12.357 --> 01:14:13.258
I just wanted to talk.

01:14:13.392 --> 01:14:14.994
If...

01:14:15.128 --> 01:14:16.629
I'm not trying to bother you.
If you just give me a moment.

01:14:16.762 --> 01:14:18.563
No, I said no.

01:14:18.697 --> 01:14:19.865
Now I'm gonna go inside,

01:14:19.999 --> 01:14:22.468
and I'm gonna ask you
to nicely leave me.

01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:25.170
You're gonna make me be mean,
and I don't wanna be mean.

01:14:25.303 --> 01:14:26.972
There's no need for you
not to be nice.

01:14:27.106 --> 01:14:28.808
I was just trying to see
if there might be some way to...

01:14:28.941 --> 01:14:30.310
Who is this guy?
Is this the guy?

01:14:30.442 --> 01:14:32.710
- I told you about him.
- So who's the guy?

01:14:32.844 --> 01:14:34.679
- Is he bothering you?
- Is he bothering you?

01:14:34.813 --> 01:14:36.147
Listen, I tried calling.

01:14:36.281 --> 01:14:37.984
I just want to have
one conversation, okay?

01:14:38.116 --> 01:14:40.319
Yeah, okay, we just did,
so now I'm gonna...

01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:42.187
If today isn't good
because I just showed up

01:14:42.321 --> 01:14:44.088
then maybe we can talk
tomorrow?

01:14:44.222 --> 01:14:45.657
I really think
you misunderstood me,

01:14:45.792 --> 01:14:47.125
and I just want a chance
to explain myself.

01:14:47.259 --> 01:14:49.195
Patrick, if you show up
at my house again,

01:14:49.328 --> 01:14:52.330
you're gonna have a problem.
Just... can I get in?

01:14:52.463 --> 01:14:54.266
Can you try seeing it
from where I'm coming from?

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.067
I don't care
where you're coming from!

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.703
You're gonna make me not nice,
and I don't like that.

01:14:57.837 --> 01:14:59.504
- So be nice.
- Don't touch me!

01:14:59.637 --> 01:15:00.972
I really want
to clock this guy!

01:15:01.106 --> 01:15:03.042
I've never wanted to fist
a face so bad in my life.

01:15:03.174 --> 01:15:05.677
Ah, that sounded way better
in my head.

01:15:05.811 --> 01:15:06.879
Can you please stop
doing this?

01:15:07.012 --> 01:15:08.179
Honestly, like,
you're a nice guy...

01:15:08.313 --> 01:15:10.148
I can't.
I told you, I can't give up.

01:15:10.281 --> 01:15:11.950
- I understand, I understand.
- Yes, you can! Just walk away!

01:15:12.084 --> 01:15:15.955
You affected me.
Okay, I was alone.

01:15:16.088 --> 01:15:18.189
I was waiting for years
to feel something for someone

01:15:18.322 --> 01:15:20.225
and I felt it for you.
I don't know.

01:15:20.359 --> 01:15:22.294
- And I understand.
- And I can't give up on that.

01:15:22.427 --> 01:15:24.797
I understand, but I don't
have feelings for you.

01:15:24.931 --> 01:15:27.566
So, what do we do now?
I try to be friends with you,

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.168
but you don't seem
to understand it.

01:15:29.302 --> 01:15:31.270
This started as a friendship,
but it became more.

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:32.605
Well, maybe for you,

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.307
but not for me,
and don't touch me, please.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.941
Listen, Honey Bee, you're
being way too nice, all right?

01:15:36.074 --> 01:15:37.176
You've got to drop the hammer
on this guy.

01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:38.777
Maybe even a table saw,
come on.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.079
- Really?
- Tell him to leave you alone.

01:15:41.213 --> 01:15:42.480
- Yell at him, go!
- Really?

01:15:42.615 --> 01:15:45.451
Come on, yeah!
Come on.

01:15:45.584 --> 01:15:47.787
- Yell?
- Yeah.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.655
Okay.

01:15:50.789 --> 01:15:54.292
Patrick, leave me alone.

01:15:54.427 --> 01:15:55.761
Could have been
a little harder.

01:15:55.895 --> 01:15:57.295
Leave me alone!
Okay?

01:15:57.429 --> 01:15:59.264
- There you go.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:15:59.398 --> 01:16:01.200
- I hear you.
- No, you don't hear me,

01:16:01.333 --> 01:16:02.901
because you're still here,
so get out of here!

01:16:03.035 --> 01:16:04.604
But I think I can show you
that you're wrong.

01:16:04.736 --> 01:16:06.672
I think we are in love.
I know that we are in love.

01:16:06.806 --> 01:16:08.272
We're not in love,
I'm not in love with you.

01:16:08.406 --> 01:16:09.909
- We're not...
- If it's this other guy?

01:16:10.042 --> 01:16:11.678
Then I can tell you
he is gonna fail you.

01:16:11.811 --> 01:16:13.344
No one is gonna love you
like I'm gonna love you.

01:16:13.478 --> 01:16:15.447
And if there's something about
me that doesn't measure up

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:18.282
that you don't like,
then I can make it better.

01:16:18.417 --> 01:16:20.151
I am incredibly capable
of change.

01:16:20.285 --> 01:16:22.020
- I can be better!
- You don't need to change!

01:16:22.154 --> 01:16:24.423
Honey Bee, drop a ton of
bricks on this guy, all right?

01:16:24.556 --> 01:16:26.359
Tell him to leave you alone.

01:16:27.293 --> 01:16:28.494
I don't want to give you
a chance.

01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:30.562
Leave me alone.

01:16:30.695 --> 01:16:33.164
- Just leave her alone, man.
- Yeah, leave me alone.

01:16:33.298 --> 01:16:34.600
We're gonna see
each other again.

01:16:34.732 --> 01:16:36.034
Oh, my God.

01:16:36.168 --> 01:16:38.004
I know you know it.
I know you feel it.

01:16:38.137 --> 01:16:39.471
I see it in your eyes.

01:16:39.605 --> 01:16:41.874
There's nothing
for you in my eyes, okay?

01:16:42.007 --> 01:16:43.442
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:43.575 --> 01:16:45.311
You were my boss, okay?
And I had to fucking leave

01:16:45.444 --> 01:16:47.646
my job because of you,
and that's not nice.

01:16:47.779 --> 01:16:48.880
I loved my job.

01:16:49.014 --> 01:16:50.982
Oh, I hate guys like this!

01:16:51.115 --> 01:16:52.884
I want to punch you
in the fucking dick!

01:16:53.017 --> 01:16:54.386
- We were working together.
- I'm not nice?

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.321
- No, you're not nice.
- You're not nice!

01:16:57.455 --> 01:16:58.990
You blew it
right here, right now.

01:16:59.124 --> 01:17:00.693
You think you're so special?

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:02.261
I would have done anything
for you,

01:17:02.395 --> 01:17:04.964
and you're gonna blow it
for some fucking asshole?

01:17:05.097 --> 01:17:06.432
He's gonna leave you,

01:17:06.566 --> 01:17:10.136
and then you're gonna come
looking for me.

01:17:10.901 --> 01:17:12.237
Okay, Michael, come.

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:14.005
- He's gonna leave you!
- Michael!

01:17:14.139 --> 01:17:16.508
And then you're
gonna come looking for me!

01:17:30.222 --> 01:17:32.291
Jesus.

01:17:36.061 --> 01:17:37.830
You know, you don't
have to live with that dickhead

01:17:37.963 --> 01:17:38.998
just showing up
at your apartment

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:40.700
whenever he feels like it,
right?

01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:42.602
Easy to say.
What's your solution?

01:17:42.735 --> 01:17:44.637
Ah, I don't know.

01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:46.739
Maybe those people
they call cops?

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:49.240
Oh, yeah?
And what do I say?

01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:51.276
He hasn't hurt me
or threatened me, really.

01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:53.245
You know?

01:17:53.379 --> 01:17:55.948
How about you have
a friend talk to him?

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.415
You guys have
any mutual friends?

01:17:57.549 --> 01:17:59.817
Well, does he seem like
he has friends to you?

01:17:59.951 --> 01:18:02.487
Okay, well.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:03.855
I can put a scare into him.

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:05.258
Oh, yeah?
And what are you gonna do?

01:18:05.391 --> 01:18:07.659
Like, whisper spooky things
in his ear?

01:18:07.793 --> 01:18:09.495
Okay, you know.
It's worth a try.

01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:10.663
You know, it worked on you.

01:18:10.795 --> 01:18:12.798
Come on, we've got
to do something.

01:18:12.931 --> 01:18:14.700
Trust me, I've been
pretty blunt.

01:18:14.833 --> 01:18:15.868
I know you think
you're being blunt,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.369
but guys like that...

01:18:17.503 --> 01:18:20.539
they need a freight train
right between the eyes.

01:18:20.672 --> 01:18:24.576
I mean, guys like that
are thick as bricks.

01:18:30.048 --> 01:18:32.952
Wait, are...

01:18:37.289 --> 01:18:39.491
Do you really want him
to leave you alone?

01:18:39.624 --> 01:18:40.958
What?

01:18:41.093 --> 01:18:44.196
Some people like
that unhealthy attention.

01:18:44.329 --> 01:18:46.932
You know?
Maybe you're preserving

01:18:47.065 --> 01:18:48.834
some illusion for him.

01:18:48.968 --> 01:18:50.402
What are you trying to say?

01:18:50.535 --> 01:18:53.504
Are you trying to say
that I actually like him...

01:18:53.638 --> 01:18:56.208
No, I don't want
to assume anything.

01:18:56.342 --> 01:18:57.844
Maybe you have
feelings for him.

01:18:57.977 --> 01:18:58.911
Maybe you don't want
to hurt my feelings.

01:19:00.847 --> 01:19:01.813
Because I feel
something for him?

01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:03.915
It could happen.

01:19:04.048 --> 01:19:05.984
Yeah.

01:19:06.884 --> 01:19:09.088
Are you jealous?

01:19:11.022 --> 01:19:14.993
I think you're jealous.
You're jealous.

01:19:26.438 --> 01:19:28.306
I'm sorry.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.540
Yeah.

01:19:29.673 --> 01:19:32.078
That just sounded
way better in my head.

01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:37.049
Apologize again.

01:19:37.182 --> 01:19:39.751
Say sorry again.

01:19:39.884 --> 01:19:41.987
Sorry.

01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:46.892
Sorry.

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.063
I'm sorry.

01:20:45.284 --> 01:20:48.219
Want to see my room?

01:20:50.422 --> 01:20:52.391
Sure.

01:21:18.115 --> 01:21:20.719
I would love to
make you dinner.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.556
I'd love to eat it
if I could.

01:21:25.657 --> 01:21:26.958
You know, you can eat
in front of me.

01:21:27.092 --> 01:21:27.959
I don't mind.

01:21:28.093 --> 01:21:30.095
It's okay.

01:21:30.227 --> 01:21:32.096
You must be hungry.

01:21:32.231 --> 01:21:34.065
I'm fine.

01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:41.007
They say the universe shrinks
down to the size of two people

01:21:41.139 --> 01:21:43.540
when they make love
for the first time.

01:21:43.674 --> 01:21:45.444
Where'd you hear that?
Who says that?

01:21:45.576 --> 01:21:48.280
Well, the entire universe
says it.

01:21:49.914 --> 01:21:53.317
It holds its breath
to see what happens.

01:21:54.218 --> 01:21:59.757
- What happens?
- New life or tragedy.

01:22:00.758 --> 01:22:04.462
I don't think the universe
knows what tragedy is.

01:22:05.263 --> 01:22:07.465
I mean, it laughs
and stares blankly

01:22:07.598 --> 01:22:11.436
as a million tragedies
happen every second.

01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:14.906
Galaxies collide without anyone
ever blinking, sorry.

01:22:15.039 --> 01:22:18.610
I think you're wrong.
You can feel it when happens.

01:22:21.847 --> 01:22:26.518
It holds its breath while fate
decides what happens next.

01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:30.020
I think that's
what an orgasm is.

01:22:30.155 --> 01:22:32.057
You must have weird orgasms.

01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:35.026
Well at least I have orgasms.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.695
Good point.

01:22:43.002 --> 01:22:44.703
I'm sorry we can't even touch.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:48.173
Well, maybe yearning is
way hotter than having it

01:22:48.306 --> 01:22:49.875
whenever you want it.

01:22:50.008 --> 01:22:53.011
Okay, now who told you that?
Because that is so not true.

01:22:53.145 --> 01:22:55.414
Well, maybe it's true to me.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:03.454
And you don't want to be
with someone

01:23:03.588 --> 01:23:07.226
who you can make love with
someday?

01:23:09.828 --> 01:23:12.464
I'm happy with you.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.736
What we're doing is crazy.

01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:20.239
I'm about the most fucked-up
guy you could bet on,

01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:22.607
and life with me
just doesn't make any sense.

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.142
I know.

01:23:25.276 --> 01:23:26.944
You're a ghost,
you're an alcoholic,

01:23:27.079 --> 01:23:28.847
and you've got bad jokes.

01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.282
And yet here I am.

01:23:34.352 --> 01:23:36.721
Here you are.

01:24:44.155 --> 01:24:45.656
I just saw my parents.

01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:52.563
They were taking my clothes
out of my apartment here.

01:24:52.697 --> 01:24:55.700
It was like watching a movie.

01:24:55.834 --> 01:24:59.337
I wasn't there,
and they were talking about me.

01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:02.708
But I could feel everything
that they felt.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.308
But it just goes on.

01:25:04.441 --> 01:25:07.245
I died, and everything
just goes on.

01:25:08.512 --> 01:25:11.316
New York doesn't stop.

01:25:12.785 --> 01:25:15.721
How about your parents?
Close?

01:25:16.655 --> 01:25:18.991
I'm very close to my mom.

01:25:56.794 --> 01:25:59.897
How is it you're dead and you
still have this apartment?

01:26:00.031 --> 01:26:01.432
My family owns the building

01:26:01.566 --> 01:26:04.469
and they're not too aggressive
about renting it just yet.

01:26:04.602 --> 01:26:08.940
But also, fifth floor walk-up
is not the most popular item

01:26:09.074 --> 01:26:11.210
and probably what
killed my out-of-shape ass,

01:26:11.343 --> 01:26:13.379
come to think.

01:26:20.953 --> 01:26:22.321
Where would you take a girl
on a date

01:26:22.454 --> 01:26:24.556
if it was the last night
of your life?

01:26:24.690 --> 01:26:26.692
For a long ride on my face.

01:26:26.825 --> 01:26:29.527
No, no, I need you to be
serious for a minute.

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.864
I'm dead serious.
My face.

01:26:34.031 --> 01:26:35.432
Or maybe Nobu.

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:36.868
Either one gets me laid.

01:26:37.002 --> 01:26:40.505
All right.
You're not helping, okay?

01:26:41.338 --> 01:26:43.674
I met this girl.

01:26:43.807 --> 01:26:45.710
Yeah, and I really feel
like she's the one.

01:26:45.843 --> 01:26:47.478
You know?
She's everything.

01:26:47.612 --> 01:26:53.017
She's this beautiful,
amazing, rare creature, and...

01:26:53.151 --> 01:26:55.287
I don't even know
why we haven't been whisked up

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:57.221
into the sky,
or whatever happens.

01:26:57.356 --> 01:27:00.392
I mean, I think
she feels it for me too.

01:27:01.392 --> 01:27:03.794
Well, it means
it's not true love,

01:27:03.928 --> 01:27:07.499
at least for one of you.
One of you is not feeling love.

01:27:07.632 --> 01:27:10.669
If you really were
a match made in...

01:27:10.802 --> 01:27:12.137
you know what I mean,

01:27:12.271 --> 01:27:15.407
then you'd both be gone.
Whoosh.

01:27:15.539 --> 01:27:19.377
For some reason,
you don't match the criteria.

01:27:19.511 --> 01:27:21.813
I mean, whatever that is.

01:27:21.946 --> 01:27:23.347
No, no, no.

01:27:23.481 --> 01:27:26.818
If we both feel it...
I mean, alive or not,

01:27:26.951 --> 01:27:29.353
isn't that it?
I mean, who's to say?

01:27:29.486 --> 01:27:32.456
Not me or you.
That much we know.

01:27:32.589 --> 01:27:34.491
Now, I've made
an entire lifetime

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:35.959
full of mistakes,

01:27:36.093 --> 01:27:39.431
and this does not feel like
one of them, all right?

01:27:39.563 --> 01:27:41.299
What about you, huh?

01:27:41.432 --> 01:27:42.766
Don't you care
about your future?

01:27:42.901 --> 01:27:45.971
I mean, you literally have
nothing to lose by trying.

01:27:46.103 --> 01:27:48.807
You're just gonna give up
by accepting fate?

01:27:50.075 --> 01:27:54.545
Bro, you're asking me
about the mysteries of life

01:27:54.678 --> 01:27:56.614
and I got a GED.

01:27:56.748 --> 01:27:58.016
I'm just looking
to wait it all out

01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:00.018
here in the comfort
of my own room

01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:03.621
with my two best pals,
Bud and Jack.

01:28:03.754 --> 01:28:05.956
I mean, what's the point?

01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:08.093
I'm sick of playing
the musical chairs game

01:28:08.226 --> 01:28:11.597
that never gives me a chair.
Why should I play?

01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:14.700
I've been alone till now,
so what's the difference?

01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:16.601
Well, now you'll cease
to exist

01:28:16.734 --> 01:28:18.203
if you don't meet someone.

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:20.271
Well, that was always true,
if you think about it.

01:28:20.405 --> 01:28:22.072
How's this different?

01:28:22.206 --> 01:28:25.744
I mean, now it's for sure.
Before, we all just assumed it.

01:28:25.877 --> 01:28:29.914
Well, now you just have
so much more to gain.

01:28:30.048 --> 01:28:31.483
Like what?

01:28:31.615 --> 01:28:33.584
Like the rest
of your existence.

01:28:33.718 --> 01:28:35.887
Eternity.
Whatever that may be.

01:28:36.021 --> 01:28:38.023
What, I'm suddenly going
to do better?

01:28:39.156 --> 01:28:40.725
I don't get women,

01:28:40.859 --> 01:28:42.627
in every sense
of the word "get."

01:28:42.761 --> 01:28:44.396
I never have.

01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:45.697
What do you mean?
Since when?

01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:48.600
- You had plenty of girls.
- Since ever.

01:28:49.267 --> 01:28:50.635
What, are you kidding?

01:28:50.768 --> 01:28:52.070
Those were whores,

01:28:52.203 --> 01:28:54.473
neighborhood chicks
who would suck your balls dry

01:28:54.606 --> 01:28:57.342
for a meal anywhere
with real cloth napkins.

01:28:57.476 --> 01:28:59.177
No, I fucked chicks.
Don't get me wrong.

01:28:59.311 --> 01:29:00.779
I'm not a virgin.

01:29:00.911 --> 01:29:04.583
I've just stayed out
of entanglements all along.

01:29:04.715 --> 01:29:07.919
And now I'm not getting
any younger or older either.

01:29:08.052 --> 01:29:09.987
And I'm gonna cease to exist
any fucking minute.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.458
I mean, you know, what girl
wants to deal with that?

01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:15.160
Nothing like the smell
of desperation

01:29:15.293 --> 01:29:18.396
to dry up the old banana hole.
You know what I mean?

01:29:18.529 --> 01:29:20.632
You're a poet.

01:29:21.333 --> 01:29:22.634
I mean, I'm in no hurry,

01:29:22.767 --> 01:29:25.369
but I'm not gonna hold on
with both hands

01:29:25.504 --> 01:29:27.338
when that cold hand grips me.

01:29:27.472 --> 01:29:32.177
Nope, can't scare me much
if you already killed me once.

01:29:37.481 --> 01:29:40.685
No, she seems to love me.

01:29:40.819 --> 01:29:42.286
I'm crazy about her.

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:43.922
And if that's not enough,
I'm gonna make it enough.

01:29:44.054 --> 01:29:45.557
All right? Fuck them.
Who are they to say?

01:29:45.691 --> 01:29:47.292
You tell them, chief.
Go get 'em.

01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:49.593
And do... I don't know.
Whatever you kids do.

01:29:49.727 --> 01:29:51.228
I'm just hoping
on my next go-around,

01:29:51.362 --> 01:29:53.932
I come back
as a huge handsome dildo.

01:29:54.066 --> 01:29:55.867
I know you will, my friend.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.436
Just be aware that she might
be sending you mixed signals.

01:29:58.569 --> 01:30:02.673
I mean, for whatever reason,
universe isn't buying it yet.

01:30:02.807 --> 01:30:04.343
Well, how am I
supposed to win?

01:30:04.476 --> 01:30:06.511
Oh, bro.

01:30:06.643 --> 01:30:08.413
Are you still trying to win?

01:30:08.547 --> 01:30:13.017
Don't you know that women
are the Kobayashi Maru test?

01:30:13.151 --> 01:30:14.018
Pardon me?

01:30:14.151 --> 01:30:15.953
Didn't you see
"Star Trek II"?

01:30:16.088 --> 01:30:17.789
Yeah, but I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

01:30:17.923 --> 01:30:19.291
You remember the beginning?

01:30:19.423 --> 01:30:21.424
It's not meant to be something
you can win.

01:30:21.558 --> 01:30:24.027
It's a test of character.

01:30:24.161 --> 01:30:25.329
What?

01:30:25.463 --> 01:30:27.865
Relationships are
the "Kobayashi Maru" test

01:30:27.999 --> 01:30:29.032
in life.

01:30:29.167 --> 01:30:30.401
You can't win.

01:30:30.535 --> 01:30:33.771
You can't keep from losing.
Nobody expects you to.

01:30:33.905 --> 01:30:36.975
It's just a measure
of your character.

01:31:05.803 --> 01:31:08.106
Meet this guy.

01:31:11.677 --> 01:31:14.446
So, Michael,
this is my friend Faith.

01:31:14.579 --> 01:31:18.616
and Faith, this is my newly
deceased friend Michael.

01:31:19.784 --> 01:31:23.121
Wait...
Come again?

01:31:24.489 --> 01:31:26.525
Honey Bee, you know
she can't see me.

01:31:26.657 --> 01:31:27.859
So what?

01:31:27.991 --> 01:31:29.494
I just wanted you
to meet my friend.

01:31:29.628 --> 01:31:31.128
I am missing
Pilates for this?

01:31:31.262 --> 01:31:32.630
She's just gonna think
you're losing it.

01:31:32.763 --> 01:31:34.331
I'm not losing it.

01:31:34.464 --> 01:31:36.667
I am pretty sure that you
are, in fact, losing it, Bee.

01:31:36.801 --> 01:31:38.370
See?

01:31:38.503 --> 01:31:40.272
I mean, how is she gonna
believe that I'm really here?

01:31:40.405 --> 01:31:41.472
Just do something.

01:31:41.606 --> 01:31:43.107
- Do something?
- Yeah, come on.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.575
Do something, show her
that I'm not batshit crazy.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:47.511
Oh, okay.

01:31:47.646 --> 01:31:49.481
- Okay, so...
- Margaritas?

01:31:49.614 --> 01:31:50.982
Oh, thank God.

01:31:51.115 --> 01:31:54.052
I ordered margaritas.
I think you should have one.

01:31:54.185 --> 01:31:55.620
Thank you.

01:31:59.089 --> 01:32:01.191
See?

01:32:01.959 --> 01:32:03.461
I can't believe
I just did that.

01:32:06.297 --> 01:32:08.499
So, huh?

01:32:12.102 --> 01:32:13.938
- I need a cigarette.
- Now you believe me.

01:32:14.071 --> 01:32:15.172
Mm.

01:32:15.306 --> 01:32:17.843
What are you doing?
You can't smoke here.

01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:20.844
Don't worry, it's fine.

01:32:20.978 --> 01:32:22.179
Cheers.

01:32:22.312 --> 01:32:23.480
Yeah, I know.

01:32:23.614 --> 01:32:24.949
Don't worry about it.

01:32:25.083 --> 01:32:27.085
And I know the guy
who owns this place, so...

01:32:31.222 --> 01:32:33.859
Did you just drink
my margarita?

01:32:36.393 --> 01:32:38.329
He did.

01:32:39.864 --> 01:32:41.098
- Okay.
- Yeah?

01:32:41.232 --> 01:32:42.266
- What the fuck?
- Now you believe me.

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.768
That is a good trick,

01:32:43.901 --> 01:32:46.637
but this means now I have
to order another one

01:32:46.771 --> 01:32:48.806
and drink yours.
Two more margs, please.

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:50.808
- Oh, that sounds good.
- So, am I crazy?

01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:52.743
Yes, sure, fine.
I believe you.

01:32:52.878 --> 01:32:54.079
- But can you please tell...
- Thank you.

01:32:54.212 --> 01:32:55.647
That guy to stay away
from my alcohol?

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.382
Please stay away
from her drinks.

01:32:57.514 --> 01:32:58.682
Okay, fine.
Okay.

01:32:58.816 --> 01:33:00.084
So, tell me
about yourself, Faith.

01:33:00.218 --> 01:33:02.420
He wants to know
about yourself.

01:33:02.553 --> 01:33:04.020
What does he look like?

01:33:04.155 --> 01:33:08.092
- Oh, he has blue eyes.
- Green.

01:33:08.226 --> 01:33:10.262
Green.
He has brown hair.

01:33:10.395 --> 01:33:13.999
And he's around...
how old are you?

01:33:14.132 --> 01:33:17.701
- 40s, but I play 30s.
- He looks, yeah.

01:33:17.834 --> 01:33:19.737
- Okay?
- Really, you play 30?

01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:22.039
- Sometimes.
- Calm down.

01:33:22.173 --> 01:33:23.541
Okay, so...

01:33:23.674 --> 01:33:25.677
what does he do?
What...

01:33:25.811 --> 01:33:27.078
What did he do,
because he's dead.

01:33:27.212 --> 01:33:28.346
Dead, he is deceased.
That's right.

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.181
Oh, I totally forgot
about that.

01:33:30.315 --> 01:33:31.549
- Yeah, I'm dead.
- He doesn't have a job.

01:33:31.682 --> 01:33:32.749
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:32.883 --> 01:33:34.886
Yeah, what do I do?
not a whole lot.

01:33:35.018 --> 01:33:37.355
I'm fucking dead, so I'm
an extremely out-of-work actor.

01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:40.258
- He's an actor.
- Have I seen him in anything?

01:33:40.391 --> 01:33:43.294
- Actors hate that question.
- Where can we see you?

01:33:43.428 --> 01:33:45.897
I was a promising
older, younger actor.

01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:48.265
I did a lot of small roles.

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.801
I did a pilot
that never went anywhere.

01:33:50.935 --> 01:33:52.036
I did a lot of theater...

01:33:52.169 --> 01:33:53.337
So, he's still
talking right now?

01:33:53.471 --> 01:33:54.839
And I had
a really well-reviewed

01:33:54.972 --> 01:33:57.274
one-man show
that was in previews.

01:33:57.407 --> 01:33:58.575
No.

01:33:58.709 --> 01:34:00.277
No?

01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:04.381
So, dead, out-of-work actor
who hasn't been in anything.

01:34:04.516 --> 01:34:09.219
Promising, out-of-work,
dead actor.

01:34:09.353 --> 01:34:12.123
Does he have any single dead
brothers that I can date?

01:34:12.257 --> 01:34:14.058
Do you have any single
dead brothers?

01:34:14.191 --> 01:34:16.328
She's funny.
I like her.

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:18.763
Thank you very much.

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:21.465
Oh, God.

01:34:21.598 --> 01:34:22.667
Wait a minute.

01:34:22.801 --> 01:34:24.669
Well, you are
a special actor.

01:34:24.802 --> 01:34:27.371
Honey Bee.

01:34:27.504 --> 01:34:29.240
I've got to go.

01:34:31.776 --> 01:34:34.578
So, he's nice, right?

01:34:34.712 --> 01:34:36.114
I'm worried about you.

01:34:36.246 --> 01:34:38.282
The whole thing just makes me
a little uncomfortable.

01:34:38.415 --> 01:34:40.083
We're not
ripping him off, Craig.

01:34:40.218 --> 01:34:41.619
It's honoring his memory.

01:34:41.752 --> 01:34:43.187
It won't be his show,

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:47.924
it'll be your show,
presented by me in his memory.

01:34:48.058 --> 01:34:50.695
This fucking guy, Jay?

01:34:50.829 --> 01:34:53.031
You gave my show
to this fucking guy?

01:34:53.164 --> 01:34:54.699
- It's like we're honoring him.
- Howdy fucking Doody?

01:34:54.831 --> 01:34:55.799
- It needs work.
- God dammit!

01:34:55.933 --> 01:34:57.201
I thought we were friends!

01:34:57.334 --> 01:34:59.136
I want to change
some lines, of course.

01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:01.172
I gonna make some changes
to your fucking head, you fuck.

01:35:01.306 --> 01:35:03.241
I think I could fix it up
a little bit, though.

01:35:03.374 --> 01:35:05.876
I want to skull fuck
your fucking ear, you dick.

01:35:06.009 --> 01:35:07.378
I know you can.

01:35:07.512 --> 01:35:10.514
Get out!

01:35:10.647 --> 01:35:12.817
Maybe the ending too.

01:35:13.884 --> 01:35:18.422
Shit, okay.
You fucking heard me.

01:35:18.556 --> 01:35:22.259
Get the fuck out!

01:35:27.999 --> 01:35:30.868
- Out!
- You know what?

01:35:31.002 --> 01:35:31.937
Give me a second here
if you can.

01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:34.039
I'm just...

01:35:35.507 --> 01:35:36.773
Ha, ha, ha!

01:35:36.907 --> 01:35:38.476
Ha!

01:35:43.813 --> 01:35:46.450
Fuck you, Jay!

01:35:48.652 --> 01:35:51.289
Cheers, motherfuckers.

01:35:54.557 --> 01:35:56.893
Where'd she go?

01:35:57.026 --> 01:35:58.730
You scared her.

01:35:58.862 --> 01:36:01.164
I have that effect.

01:36:01.298 --> 01:36:02.667
Well, that went well.

01:36:02.801 --> 01:36:04.735
Yeah, I thought so.

01:36:04.869 --> 01:36:06.737
She's great.

01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:08.605
She is.

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:11.910
A pain in the ass.

01:36:14.145 --> 01:36:16.748
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.115
You okay?
What's wrong?

01:36:18.249 --> 01:36:20.418
I've got to go.

01:36:25.190 --> 01:36:26.956
Scarlett?
Jah!

01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:28.759
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

01:36:28.892 --> 01:36:30.761
All right.
What does it mean

01:36:30.895 --> 01:36:32.496
if someone alive
fades in and out?

01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:33.864
What do you mean?

01:36:33.998 --> 01:36:35.333
Well, I found a girl.
All right?

01:36:35.467 --> 01:36:36.968
And I've got to tell you,
I really feel it,

01:36:37.101 --> 01:36:41.239
but there's no "whoosh."
There's no big... thing.

01:36:41.371 --> 01:36:43.907
But she can see me,
and she can hear me.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.509
But she fades in and out
every now and again.

01:36:46.643 --> 01:36:49.847
She's alive, but she shimmers
like a dead person.

01:36:49.981 --> 01:36:51.816
I mean, what does that mean?

01:36:51.949 --> 01:36:53.951
It means she's going
to die soon,

01:36:54.084 --> 01:36:55.352
very soon.

01:36:55.486 --> 01:36:57.088
Normally, it's not possible
to bond with someone

01:36:57.221 --> 01:37:00.023
who's on the other side
of the line, but she's close,

01:37:00.157 --> 01:37:01.325
very close.

01:37:01.459 --> 01:37:03.193
What?
How's that supposed to be?

01:37:03.326 --> 01:37:04.661
Might be good news for you.

01:37:04.795 --> 01:37:08.465
That she's gonna die?
No, I can't let her die.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.834
But death isn't the end.
You know that.

01:37:10.968 --> 01:37:12.569
It's how you met her
in the first place.

01:37:12.703 --> 01:37:15.572
She's close to the edge,
so she can glimpse over.

01:37:15.706 --> 01:37:17.540
So I have to let
something terrible happen

01:37:17.674 --> 01:37:19.209
to a healthy young woman

01:37:19.343 --> 01:37:21.178
so I can hope that it means
we work out for each other?

01:37:21.312 --> 01:37:24.215
I mean, she's young.
She still has her whole life.

01:37:24.347 --> 01:37:27.817
But maybe she's supposed to
follow you to the other side.

01:37:28.652 --> 01:37:31.690
Or maybe not.
It's really not up to us, so...

01:37:31.822 --> 01:37:33.223
So, I have to find
a soul mate,

01:37:33.356 --> 01:37:35.092
and you're telling me
it's all fate and destiny

01:37:35.226 --> 01:37:37.695
and free will and magic
and all that bullshit,

01:37:37.829 --> 01:37:40.298
but you're saying we can't
do anything about this?

01:37:40.432 --> 01:37:41.633
That's a stupid answer.

01:37:41.766 --> 01:37:44.102
Well, it is the answer.

01:37:45.335 --> 01:37:46.570
Is there anyone
in the afterlife

01:37:46.704 --> 01:37:48.572
who's good at their job?

01:37:56.045 --> 01:37:57.647
There you are.

01:38:01.919 --> 01:38:03.220
Pick up.

01:38:03.353 --> 01:38:04.722
<i>Hi, you've reached Honey
Bee.</i>

01:38:04.855 --> 01:38:06.156
- <i>I can't come to the phone.</i>
- Ugh! Pick up.

01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:07.824
<i>Leave a message, bye.</i>

01:38:07.959 --> 01:38:09.327
Oh, hi, Honey Bee.

01:38:09.459 --> 01:38:12.896
I was trying to reach you,
been trying all day.

01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:14.897
I know you asked me
not to call.

01:38:15.031 --> 01:38:16.301
So I thought I'd just call?

01:38:16.433 --> 01:38:19.869
So maybe you could
call me back, you know?

01:38:20.004 --> 01:38:22.706
I mean, if you don't mind.

01:38:22.839 --> 01:38:24.909
I know you know my number.

01:38:25.043 --> 01:38:26.811
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:38:26.945 --> 01:38:30.215
God, you are such
a douchebag!

01:38:30.347 --> 01:38:33.650
Where are you going now,
you fucking dipshit?

01:38:50.935 --> 01:38:53.538
I wish I could fart right now.

01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:00.412
Fuck.

01:39:13.223 --> 01:39:14.525
Hello.

01:39:14.657 --> 01:39:17.661
Patrick?
Dammit, I told you that...

01:39:20.999 --> 01:39:23.032
Oh, my God.

01:39:23.167 --> 01:39:25.069
What the fuck!

01:39:25.203 --> 01:39:26.904
Why the fuck did you do that?

01:39:27.036 --> 01:39:28.705
Who the hell was that?

01:39:28.838 --> 01:39:30.140
Is anybody here?

01:39:30.273 --> 01:39:32.276
Help!

01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:03.575
No.
No.

01:40:20.190 --> 01:40:22.726
Bro!
I got the most amazing news.

01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:23.962
What?

01:40:24.094 --> 01:40:25.795
I met someone.
I wasn't even looking.

01:40:25.929 --> 01:40:28.798
I was actively not looking.
I was avoiding, in fact.

01:40:28.932 --> 01:40:31.435
I'm hanging out in the
bathroom, watching ladies pee.

01:40:31.569 --> 01:40:33.704
Next thing I know, I meet
the most amazing dead girl.

01:40:33.838 --> 01:40:34.938
Nice.

01:40:35.071 --> 01:40:37.206
But she wasn't peeing.
She was just hanging out.

01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:38.575
And I know what you thinking,

01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:40.511
and but she's not a dyke
or anything, you know.

01:40:40.643 --> 01:40:41.745
She was just catching
a moment alone,

01:40:41.879 --> 01:40:43.148
and there I was.

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.581
That's great, Angelo!
I've got to go.

01:40:44.714 --> 01:40:46.450
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't you get it, man?

01:40:46.584 --> 01:40:49.020
It's real.
It's possible.

01:40:49.154 --> 01:40:50.721
I mean,
the joke's not on us after all.

01:40:50.855 --> 01:40:53.324
I thought I had no hope.
I thought there was no hope.

01:40:53.456 --> 01:40:55.491
And then I turn around,
and there she is.

01:40:55.625 --> 01:40:56.994
Hey, Angelo,
I'm proud of you, all right?

01:40:57.128 --> 01:40:59.030
But I got something really
important I got to go do.

01:40:59.163 --> 01:41:01.098
Yeah, yeah, listen.
Me too, man.

01:41:01.231 --> 01:41:02.766
This means I get to go.

01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:05.402
Look, I mean, nothing's
happened yet, but I think soon.

01:41:05.535 --> 01:41:07.538
I got to meet her in
a few hours back at the can,

01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:10.174
but I think something
good's gonna...

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:13.476
Oh, no, man.

01:41:13.611 --> 01:41:16.748
- Angelo?
- Now?

01:41:17.581 --> 01:41:19.917
- Oh, man.
- What is it?

01:41:20.049 --> 01:41:21.985
No.

01:41:22.119 --> 01:41:24.923
No, man.
No.

01:41:25.856 --> 01:41:27.759
Angelo?

01:41:28.692 --> 01:41:31.628
Oh, no.

01:41:31.762 --> 01:41:33.731
Oh, God.

01:41:42.706 --> 01:41:45.343
How do I know what to do?

01:41:50.347 --> 01:41:52.282
Oh.

01:41:53.250 --> 01:41:55.753
No.
No, not yet.

01:42:04.395 --> 01:42:06.030
Hi.

01:42:06.931 --> 01:42:08.732
Please, don't ever do that
to me again, okay?

01:42:08.865 --> 01:42:09.999
Oh, God.

01:42:10.133 --> 01:42:11.902
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just me, okay?

01:42:12.035 --> 01:42:13.870
I just need to talk to you.

01:42:14.004 --> 01:42:15.505
I tried knocking, but...

01:42:15.639 --> 01:42:18.776
It's okay.
Tell me.

01:42:20.311 --> 01:42:21.879
I need you to go.

01:42:22.012 --> 01:42:24.547
Yeah, I need you
to get out of town.

01:42:24.681 --> 01:42:25.883
Something bad is
gonna happen,

01:42:26.016 --> 01:42:27.417
and I just need you
to not be here.

01:42:27.551 --> 01:42:29.253
What are you talking about?

01:42:29.386 --> 01:42:30.654
Well, your life is in danger.

01:42:30.788 --> 01:42:32.423
Just...
Can you just trust me?

01:42:32.556 --> 01:42:35.058
I trust you, but if you don't
tell me what's going on,

01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:36.592
how am I supposed to...

01:42:36.727 --> 01:42:38.829
I need you to leave.
You can go.

01:42:38.962 --> 01:42:40.031
I mean, this is all...

01:42:40.164 --> 01:42:42.532
There's nothing here
that you need to hold on to.

01:42:42.667 --> 01:42:43.767
I can't just pack up
and leave, I don't...

01:42:43.901 --> 01:42:45.102
Yes, you can!

01:42:45.235 --> 01:42:46.904
People always think that
they can't leave, but they can.

01:42:47.038 --> 01:42:48.371
Okay?
Yeah.

01:42:48.504 --> 01:42:49.873
All of this
is just stuff.

01:42:50.007 --> 01:42:51.174
Your job is just work.

01:42:51.308 --> 01:42:52.810
Okay?
I'm talking about your life.

01:42:52.942 --> 01:42:55.245
- None of this is important!
- That's insulting.

01:42:55.379 --> 01:42:57.280
I don't understand
what you're saying, I mean...

01:42:57.414 --> 01:42:58.682
We just act like there's
a tornado,

01:42:58.816 --> 01:43:00.518
and you don't want to be
that old lady

01:43:00.651 --> 01:43:02.252
going back to her trailer
for a scrapbook and a parakeet.

01:43:02.386 --> 01:43:03.286
Huh?
Come on, let's pack up and go.

01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:04.722
Could you please tell me

01:43:04.855 --> 01:43:06.257
- what's going on?
- Do you have a suitcase?

01:43:06.389 --> 01:43:07.892
What could be
so fucking important?

01:43:08.025 --> 01:43:09.326
Huh?

01:43:09.459 --> 01:43:11.094
What is it?
Please leave.

01:43:11.227 --> 01:43:12.730
No, I'm not leaving.

01:43:12.864 --> 01:43:14.398
If you don't tell me what's
going on, I'm not leaving.

01:43:14.531 --> 01:43:17.400
Agh!
Okay, how about this?

01:43:17.534 --> 01:43:19.203
Let's flip a coin.

01:43:19.335 --> 01:43:21.472
Heads, you do what I say.

01:43:21.605 --> 01:43:23.173
Tails, you can stay here
as long as you want.

01:43:23.307 --> 01:43:25.310
Okay?
That's fair, right?

01:43:35.887 --> 01:43:37.554
Just go away.

01:43:37.687 --> 01:43:40.523
Just go far away
and don't tell another soul,

01:43:40.656 --> 01:43:42.825
for lack of a better word,
where you're going, okay?

01:43:42.959 --> 01:43:46.096
Just go nowhere.
Any nowhere but here.

01:43:46.230 --> 01:43:48.365
I'll take care of everything.

01:43:48.499 --> 01:43:49.500
What are you gonna do?

01:43:49.633 --> 01:43:51.202
You can barely move
a Dixie cup.

01:43:51.334 --> 01:43:53.837
Just keep packing.

01:43:54.504 --> 01:43:55.972
Don't worry, I'll find you.

01:43:56.106 --> 01:43:57.675
I'll let you know when it's
safe to come back, okay?

01:43:57.807 --> 01:43:59.976
I just need to keep going
and stay off your phone.

01:44:00.111 --> 01:44:01.512
- Where are you gonna go?
- I don't know,

01:44:01.645 --> 01:44:02.980
but I just got
to do something, okay?

01:44:03.114 --> 01:44:05.115
Your life is more important
than you understand.

01:44:05.249 --> 01:44:06.550
You can't understand it.

01:44:06.683 --> 01:44:08.351
You're still alive.

01:44:08.486 --> 01:44:11.689
What makes you so sure you
know more about life now?

01:44:11.821 --> 01:44:15.191
Because... because
it's different now, okay?

01:44:15.325 --> 01:44:17.428
I need to protect you.

01:44:17.562 --> 01:44:21.065
I meet a girl,
and I can't just let her go.

01:44:24.968 --> 01:44:26.870
Any girl?

01:44:32.508 --> 01:44:34.111
I've got to go.

01:44:34.245 --> 01:44:36.214
You've got to go.
Okay?

01:44:36.347 --> 01:44:38.816
I'll fix everything!

01:44:41.084 --> 01:44:43.286
Where am I going?

01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:46.222
Just go!
Anywhere!

01:45:20.723 --> 01:45:23.393
I have always loved you.

01:45:23.527 --> 01:45:28.731
I will never love anyone
like I love you.

01:45:28.865 --> 01:45:33.603
And no one will ever love you
like I love you now.

01:45:43.513 --> 01:45:47.217
Now the end has finally come.

01:45:48.785 --> 01:45:52.190
And now we ride off
into the sun.

01:46:30.695 --> 01:46:32.163
<i>Hi, you've reached
Honey Bee.</i>

01:46:32.295 --> 01:46:35.766
<i>I can't talk
on the phone right now.</i>

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.802
Taxi!

01:46:39.369 --> 01:46:41.405
<i>Hi, you've reached...</i>

01:46:53.383 --> 01:46:55.853
Listen, Michael said I had
to leave town.

01:46:55.986 --> 01:46:57.622
- I'm not gonna be...
- <i>No, are you crazy?</i>

01:46:57.754 --> 01:46:59.188
You can't leave town right now.

01:46:59.322 --> 01:47:01.592
<i>What, for someone
you barely can even see?</i>

01:47:01.725 --> 01:47:02.859
- I don't know.
- What is your imaginary pal

01:47:02.993 --> 01:47:04.495
gonna tell you to do next?

01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:06.030
<i>You're usually
a very rational person.</i>

01:47:06.163 --> 01:47:07.964
Well, have you ever known me
to be irrational?

01:47:08.097 --> 01:47:09.832
Most of the time,
yes, you are, but...

01:47:09.967 --> 01:47:11.802
Well, doesn't that tell you
that I've seen some shit?

01:47:11.935 --> 01:47:14.004
Or you think that
you've seen some shit.

01:47:14.137 --> 01:47:16.907
Okay, I'll call you back.
Bye.

01:47:18.909 --> 01:47:21.712
Scarlett.
Scarlett!

01:47:25.615 --> 01:47:27.116
You can't do this, Michael.

01:47:27.250 --> 01:47:29.419
This isn't gonna work out
for you the way you want it to.

01:47:29.553 --> 01:47:30.821
If you're not
gonna help me,

01:47:30.954 --> 01:47:32.489
then at least just stay
out of my way, okay?

01:47:32.623 --> 01:47:34.558
You can't change destiny.

01:47:34.691 --> 01:47:37.627
Frankly, Scarlett,
I don't give a fuck.

01:47:41.597 --> 01:47:42.966
We need to talk, Michael.

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:46.870
No, you need to talk.
I need to run.

01:48:26.177 --> 01:48:29.146
Honey Bee!
Honey Bee!

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.848
Wait, wait!

01:48:31.981 --> 01:48:33.015
What are you doing here?

01:48:33.148 --> 01:48:35.352
I need you to come
with me, okay?

01:48:35.486 --> 01:48:36.854
Please, just don't
be here, okay?

01:48:36.986 --> 01:48:39.123
- Is this even real?
- You know I'm real, okay?

01:48:39.255 --> 01:48:42.293
And I just need you
to not leave right now.

01:48:44.026 --> 01:48:46.061
I know I told you to run away,
but I...

01:48:46.195 --> 01:48:47.697
I need to talk to you
one more time.

01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:49.766
Talk to me about what?
I don't understand.

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.802
I need to tell you something.
I need to...

01:48:51.936 --> 01:48:53.904
I wanted to say...

01:48:55.371 --> 01:48:57.206
Please.

01:48:57.340 --> 01:48:59.442
I wanted to say goodbye.

01:49:04.882 --> 01:49:07.083
No, no.
Not goodbye.

01:49:07.217 --> 01:49:09.052
No, just come with me, please.
Just...

01:49:09.186 --> 01:49:10.888
I need you to not be here
if this is where it happens.

01:49:11.021 --> 01:49:12.856
Just do not be
where you're expected.

01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:14.291
Please, I don't have any time!

01:49:14.423 --> 01:49:15.625
I don't understand.

01:49:15.758 --> 01:49:17.226
I don't have any time
to explain!

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.795
Explain what?

01:49:31.874 --> 01:49:33.476
I love you.

01:49:33.610 --> 01:49:36.580
Yeah, you.

01:49:36.713 --> 01:49:39.382
I know it.

01:49:39.517 --> 01:49:40.785
I know it because I love you

01:49:40.918 --> 01:49:45.121
without any of the stuff
that I thought mattered.

01:49:46.389 --> 01:49:48.057
I think you love me too.

01:49:48.191 --> 01:49:51.262
And I don't want to leave here
unless I hear it.

01:49:52.995 --> 01:49:54.864
Something bad
is gonna happen.

01:49:54.998 --> 01:49:56.700
And I need to stop it.

01:49:56.833 --> 01:49:57.968
I'm sure as fuck gonna try,

01:49:58.102 --> 01:49:59.770
because I don't want to live
without you.

01:49:59.902 --> 01:50:02.940
The only thing
I have to lose is you.

01:50:04.307 --> 01:50:07.476
If saving you here means I lose
you forever, I don't care!

01:50:07.611 --> 01:50:08.912
Because you need to live,

01:50:09.044 --> 01:50:11.714
even if I don't get
to share it with you.

01:50:11.848 --> 01:50:14.918
You have the entire world,

01:50:15.052 --> 01:50:16.853
and I only have you.

01:50:20.656 --> 01:50:22.759
But I love you.

01:50:22.892 --> 01:50:25.294
I do.

01:50:25.428 --> 01:50:27.531
I love you.

01:50:55.793 --> 01:50:57.962
I love you.

01:51:00.297 --> 01:51:04.701
Michael, it's time.
Let her go.

01:51:04.834 --> 01:51:06.102
You have to come with me.

01:51:06.236 --> 01:51:07.338
No.

01:51:07.471 --> 01:51:09.440
No, that's not right.

01:51:09.572 --> 01:51:10.906
Honey Bee, look at me.

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:13.143
You need to run!
Leave now!

01:51:13.977 --> 01:51:16.213
I want to stay with you.

01:51:19.583 --> 01:51:21.351
I...

01:51:21.485 --> 01:51:22.486
Let her go.

01:51:22.619 --> 01:51:24.789
Trust me, go!

01:51:39.736 --> 01:51:43.808
No!

01:52:38.562 --> 01:52:41.465
This is what
I was warning you about.

01:52:43.133 --> 01:52:44.635
So she comes here,
what happens?

01:52:44.767 --> 01:52:46.837
Where do I find her?

01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:49.138
She died alone, too, right?

01:52:50.374 --> 01:52:51.675
If it was going to happen,

01:52:51.807 --> 01:52:54.977
it would have happened
right then.

01:52:55.111 --> 01:52:57.848
If both of you
had felt complete love,

01:52:57.981 --> 01:53:00.551
we wouldn't be
sitting here right now.

01:53:01.618 --> 01:53:02.986
It's time.

01:53:03.119 --> 01:53:05.922
I'm sorry.
I don't make the rules.

01:53:06.056 --> 01:53:08.525
Well, the rules
are obviously wrong.

01:53:09.825 --> 01:53:12.261
We loved each other.

01:53:12.395 --> 01:53:14.196
You were there.
You heard her.

01:53:14.329 --> 01:53:17.232
Okay, she was gonna say it.

01:53:17.234 --> 01:53:20.169
That means we move on together.

01:53:20.303 --> 01:53:22.306
I need to talk to whoever
makes the rules, okay?

01:53:22.438 --> 01:53:25.275
Assemble the fucking committee.
Who do I got to talk to?

01:53:25.407 --> 01:53:27.343
- Michael.
- She was willing to die

01:53:27.477 --> 01:53:31.081
even if it meant giving up
her life to be with me.

01:53:31.213 --> 01:53:32.749
Isn't that enough?

01:53:32.883 --> 01:53:34.784
Isn't that enough
for you fuckers?

01:53:34.918 --> 01:53:36.786
No.

01:53:36.919 --> 01:53:39.255
It's not.

01:53:39.388 --> 01:53:45.228
You keep thinking that
it's a vote or a decision,

01:53:45.361 --> 01:53:47.129
but it's not.
It's...

01:53:47.263 --> 01:53:49.298
It's like a chemical reaction.

01:53:49.432 --> 01:53:51.600
Water either becomes steam,
or it doesn't.

01:53:51.735 --> 01:53:54.103
We don't vote it
into being steam.

01:53:54.236 --> 01:53:56.772
Enough
with the fucking metaphors!

01:53:56.905 --> 01:53:58.907
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:53:59.042 --> 01:54:01.111
Look...

01:54:01.245 --> 01:54:03.546
Can I just see her
one more time?

01:54:03.679 --> 01:54:04.847
Is that too much to ask?

01:54:04.981 --> 01:54:07.316
Just one more moment
with her, please?

01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:08.984
Just one more fucking moment.

01:54:09.119 --> 01:54:12.089
- It doesn't work like that.
- Then change how it works!

01:54:13.057 --> 01:54:15.292
They're not gonna fire you
for helping out one person.

01:54:15.424 --> 01:54:17.793
Okay?
Just please, I'm begging you.

01:54:17.927 --> 01:54:19.129
Just...

01:54:19.262 --> 01:54:20.797
What are they gonna do,
demote you?

01:54:20.929 --> 01:54:22.266
- Please come with me.
- Here.

01:54:22.398 --> 01:54:23.933
- Michael.
- Here, here.

01:54:24.066 --> 01:54:26.002
No, here.

01:54:26.136 --> 01:54:30.540
If it's tails, I'll drop it.
I'll leave you alone about it.

01:54:32.142 --> 01:54:34.278
Would you please
come with me?

01:54:35.344 --> 01:54:37.847
You're telling me it's all
a coin flip anyway.

01:54:37.981 --> 01:54:39.550
That fate's random.

01:54:39.682 --> 01:54:41.183
You turn left,
you meet the person

01:54:41.317 --> 01:54:42.718
you're supposed to spend
eternity with.

01:54:42.852 --> 01:54:45.321
You turn right, I've got
to follow you to some office

01:54:45.454 --> 01:54:47.990
or wherever you're taking me.

01:54:48.124 --> 01:54:50.093
Just let me flip it again.

01:54:51.561 --> 01:54:53.263
I'm just asking for one minute.

01:54:53.396 --> 01:54:55.799
One 60-second moment
of eternity,

01:54:55.932 --> 01:54:57.334
and you can't spare that?

01:54:57.467 --> 01:54:59.335
Okay, I never believed in
a goddamn thing my whole life,

01:54:59.468 --> 01:55:01.837
and now, of all things,
I find out that love is real

01:55:01.972 --> 01:55:03.306
and you're telling me
it doesn't...

01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.241
because I can't prove it
to your satisfaction?

01:55:05.374 --> 01:55:06.243
- What is that?
- Michael.

01:55:06.375 --> 01:55:07.543
Wait, wait.
Please.

01:55:07.677 --> 01:55:10.146
Whatever you're gonna say,
just stop, okay.

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:13.549
Before you were this person,
before you had this job,

01:55:13.682 --> 01:55:15.051
when you were a real
fucking human being...

01:55:15.185 --> 01:55:17.620
Michael, we don't have
time for this.

01:55:17.754 --> 01:55:19.322
Can't you just...

01:55:19.455 --> 01:55:22.392
Can't the universe spare
just one last goodbye?

01:55:23.593 --> 01:55:26.263
Just please come with me.

01:56:15.678 --> 01:56:18.181
I love you too.

01:57:11.272 --> 01:57:13.070
