(serene music playing)

00:59.133 --> 01:01.500
Hi, Ma. What you doing?

01:01.567 --> 01:04.166
Looking through
the old photo album.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.000
You were a cute kid.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.700
Yeah. I was cute.
There I am at 7.

01:09.767 --> 01:12.467
-An angel.
-Here I am at 11.

01:12.533 --> 01:13.967
Adorable.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.967
Here I am at 15.

01:16.033 --> 01:19.066
The beginning of the end.

01:19.567 --> 01:22.500
-Hi.
-How did auditions go?

01:22.567 --> 01:25.600
Great. Oh, you should
have tried out, Dorothy.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.567
Everybody was really stinky.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.233
You might have gotten a part.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.700
Don't be silly.

01:32.767 --> 01:34.000
Dorothy couldn't get a part.

01:34.066 --> 01:36.834
It's the award-winning musical <i>Cats.</i>

01:36.900 --> 01:40.400
You have to be agile,
graceful, and sensual.

01:40.467 --> 01:44.133
Right. How could I possibly
compete with you?

01:44.200 --> 01:47.900
You've given some of your finest
performances in back alleys.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.667
Dorothy, I resent that remark.

01:52.734 --> 01:54.700
Have you been talking to Ed Tyler?

01:56.333 --> 01:59.400
Oh, that man has
such a big mouth.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.400
Which reminds me,
I want to call him.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.400
Oh, gosh.

02:05.467 --> 02:08.066
She's really a character.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.033
She's also a cheap slut.

02:12.033 --> 02:14.100
(doorbell rings)

02:18.967 --> 02:22.900
-Hi. It's me, Stan.
-Oh, who cares?

02:22.967 --> 02:24.367
Oh, hi, Sophia.

02:24.433 --> 02:29.900
I was listening to the Dodgers.
I got this urge to see a ballgame.

02:29.967 --> 02:34.600
If you leave now, you can make
Dodger stadium in five days.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.400
Drive carefully.

02:36.467 --> 02:39.533
Wait, Dorothy.
I was thinking about us.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.667
The good old days back in
Brooklyn... Ebbets field.

02:43.734 --> 02:46.200
Remember those
warm summer nights

02:46.266 --> 02:49.700
sitting in the bleachers
eating hot dogs,

02:49.767 --> 02:51.633
rooting for the Dodgers,

02:51.700 --> 02:53.800
and kissing passionately
between innings?

02:53.867 --> 02:57.934
Stanley, you never
took me to Ebbets field.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.333
-No?
-No!

03:01.300 --> 03:04.433
Then it must have been
a guy from work.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.633
-I've heard enough.
-You'll have the time of your life.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.567
"The time of my life"?

03:09.633 --> 03:14.467
The last time you said that,
it took 12 seconds,

03:14.533 --> 03:18.533
and I ended up three months pregnant
at my own wedding.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.934
I got three tickets
to today's ballgame.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.800
Nobody will go with me.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.333
I don't have many friends.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.433
Aw, who are you kidding?

03:27.500 --> 03:29.567
You don't have any friends.

03:30.633 --> 03:32.667
Oh, I'll go with you, Stan.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.100
Ma! You will?

03:34.166 --> 03:35.767
I'll wait in the car.

03:36.867 --> 03:37.734
Dorothy?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.934
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do less.

03:40.967 --> 03:43.033
Want to go to bed with me?

03:43.100 --> 03:44.867
Take me out to the ballgame.

03:47.233 --> 03:50.233
(serene music playing)

03:52.166 --> 03:58.333
Stanley, these seats
are pretty far from the... field.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.200
Yeah.

03:59.266 --> 04:03.800
Dorothy, baseball was meant
to be seen from the bleachers

04:03.867 --> 04:06.767
in small, intimate parks
with real grass.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.000
I hate artificial turf.

04:09.066 --> 04:11.133
You never stopped
wearing it on your head.

04:12.266 --> 04:15.700
I'm having fun,
so your insults can't bother me.

04:15.767 --> 04:16.934
Comfy, babe?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.967
Yes. This must be my lucky day.

04:20.033 --> 04:23.000
I usually end up
sitting next to a fat, sweaty man

04:23.066 --> 04:25.400
who takes his shirt off.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.667
What kept you?

04:32.834 --> 04:36.300
-You want a hot dog, babe?
-No, thanks.

04:36.367 --> 04:38.533
-A sun visor?
-No.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.467
-A cushion for your chair?
-How about cutting the crap?

04:42.533 --> 04:45.200
What do you want from me?

04:45.266 --> 04:49.767
I was waiting until we sang
"take me out to the ballgame."

04:49.834 --> 04:52.166
I'm having a business problem.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.500
What?

04:53.567 --> 04:55.533
I'm bankrupt.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.300
I just need a few bucks
until the end of the month.

05:00.367 --> 05:04.233
-We're leaving.
-Let's see one man bat.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.066
(crack)

05:05.133 --> 05:06.900
What a hit!

05:06.967 --> 05:08.967
I got it!

05:11.133 --> 05:14.367
-Are you all right?
-Fine. Fine.

05:14.433 --> 05:15.567
Only next time, Salvadore,

05:15.633 --> 05:18.700
we start lower on the bed
or move the headboard.

05:22.934 --> 05:26.266
(calm music playing)

05:38.934 --> 05:41.667
We rushed over from rehearsal.

05:41.734 --> 05:43.700
How is she, Dorothy?

05:43.767 --> 05:45.100
The doctor says she's fine.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.166
She's just shaken up.

05:47.233 --> 05:49.967
Right now rest is the best thing.

05:50.033 --> 05:51.767
She's a tough old broad.

05:51.834 --> 05:54.133
Well, I knew she'd be ok.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.734
Something similar happened to me
back in St. Olaf.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.467
I was injured during a spirited game
of Gowhackanoggin.

06:02.767 --> 06:07.600
Should I? Oh, what the hell.
Rose, what is Gowhackanoggin?

06:08.133 --> 06:11.667
It's a lot like baseball,
except instead of hitting a ball,

06:11.734 --> 06:13.800
you whack yourself on the head.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.967
After 10 whacks, if you're
still Standing, you take first base.

06:19.033 --> 06:21.567
It's usually a low-scoring game.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.133
Let's check out the coffee shop.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.934
Maybe there are cute doctors.

06:27.433 --> 06:29.166
-Hello.
-He's married.

06:29.233 --> 06:30.533
Goodbye.

06:34.433 --> 06:36.367
Those two here for a C.A.T. scan?

06:41.033 --> 06:42.233
How's the patient?

06:44.133 --> 06:46.567
Turn off that damned light.
I'm trying to sleep.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.066
Ma!

06:49.000 --> 06:50.367
Where am I?

06:50.433 --> 06:52.166
Who am I?

06:52.233 --> 06:54.467
Why am I so wrinkled?

06:54.533 --> 06:55.767
Don't be alarmed.

06:55.834 --> 06:57.500
Temporary amnesia
isn't uncommon.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.700
Sophia.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.133
It's Stan.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.233
Do you remember me?

07:02.300 --> 07:06.033
Stan? Tall, yutz, head
looks like a monkey's behind?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.834
She's going to be all right.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.433
How you feeling, Ma?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.400
-I'm fine. Let's go home.
-Mrs. Petrillo.

07:16.467 --> 07:17.734
I'm Dr. Cauley.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.700
Pleased to meet you.
Goodbye.

07:19.767 --> 07:24.467
We'd really like you to stay
with us for the next 48 hours.

07:24.533 --> 07:27.066
For half the price,
I could go to Club Med,

07:27.133 --> 07:31.233
get a nicer room,
and not have to pee in a dixie cup.

07:36.300 --> 07:40.367
Is there a draft in here?
Oh! Whoa!

07:40.433 --> 07:42.567
Get back in that bed.

07:42.633 --> 07:45.100
I'm in tiptop shape.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.767
There's no reason to stay here.

07:48.533 --> 07:50.567
Medic!

07:58.700 --> 08:01.533
-Stop that!
-Cut it out!

08:01.600 --> 08:03.700
Calm down! Calm down!
What's wrong?

08:03.767 --> 08:05.533
They're driving me crazy.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.800
They drink milk off floors.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.033
They scratch the furniture.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.266
This one just coughed up a fur ball.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.266
That was not a fur ball.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.400
Rose, who cares what it was?

08:16.467 --> 08:18.900
Quit driving ma crazy.

08:18.967 --> 08:21.633
Our director said
to prepare for our roles,

08:21.700 --> 08:23.700
we must become cats.

08:23.767 --> 08:26.900
That's why I play
with that ball of yarn

08:26.967 --> 08:29.900
and Blanche makes those
high-pitched sounds

08:29.967 --> 08:32.133
in her room at night.

08:33.867 --> 08:37.233
You've been practicing for this part
for a lifetime, haven't you?

08:39.867 --> 08:42.734
Ma, the doctor said
you stay in bed.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.100
Oh, I'm fine.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.333
(doorbell rings)

08:48.700 --> 08:51.734
The hospital staff said Sophia
was discharged. Is she here?

08:51.800 --> 08:54.266
I haven't taken her
out of the car trunk.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.834
Oh, there you are, Sophia.
Are you ok?

08:58.900 --> 09:01.700
I spent two days
naked under a sheet

09:01.767 --> 09:03.700
with strange men
inspecting my body

09:03.767 --> 09:05.734
with cold, metal instruments.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.000
Which reminds me,
has Ed Tyler returned my call?

09:10.867 --> 09:14.000
We need to rehearse.
Will you help us?

09:14.066 --> 09:15.200
All right.

09:15.266 --> 09:17.633
We'll find a rug
to sharpen claws on.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.333
How about the one
on Stanley's head?

09:23.834 --> 09:28.500
Sophia, you know, it's been a
long time since we've had a talk.

09:28.567 --> 09:31.800
Good reason,
I hate talking to you.

09:33.066 --> 09:37.500
What a great sense of humor.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.200
What would you say if I told you

09:39.266 --> 09:42.934
I've devised a great way
to make fast money.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.233
All you do is lie on your back.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.633
You're about 50 years
too late on that one.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.433
I'm talking about a lawsuit.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.000
If we show you're severely injured,

09:56.066 --> 09:58.900
we can sue the Ball Club
for lots of money.

09:58.967 --> 10:00.500
I'm not severely injured.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.767
You can fake it.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.266
My doctor friend
will back you up.

10:04.333 --> 10:07.967
I'm appalled, shocked, disgusted.

10:08.033 --> 10:10.667
How much money
are we talking about?

10:10.734 --> 10:13.200
A couple 100,000 at least.

10:13.266 --> 10:15.767
A couple 100,000?

10:20.533 --> 10:21.300
Where's ma?

10:21.367 --> 10:23.500
Down here, paralyzed.

10:23.567 --> 10:28.133
-What?
-Sophia! Honey.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.100
Oh, dear.

10:31.400 --> 10:36.233
(calm music playing)

10:36.300 --> 10:38.967
I insist on taking
you back to the hospital.

10:39.033 --> 10:40.633
I don't want to go.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.233
You should see a doctor.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.633
The doctor's coming.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.066
-What doctor?
-A friend.

10:46.133 --> 10:49.233
-We're going to the hospital.
-This guy is good.

10:49.300 --> 10:53.800
He's probably the most
respected neurologist in the state.

10:53.867 --> 10:56.000
How'd you ever meet
a man like that?

10:57.500 --> 11:00.200
We were judges
at a Wet T-shirt contest.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.600
-I'm calling the hospital.
-Dorothy, stop.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.700
I really feel like
this is all my fault.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.800
That's why I'm getting him.
He's the best.

11:09.867 --> 11:11.300
I'm gonna pay for it.

11:11.367 --> 11:14.433
You paying for something?

11:14.500 --> 11:15.800
What are you saying?
I'm cheap?

11:15.867 --> 11:17.600
Of course.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.867
You own a time-share dog.

11:23.467 --> 11:25.500
Ma, listen,
I'm taking you to the hospital.

11:25.567 --> 11:28.734
No, I want Stan's doctor.
I trust this sweet man.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.500
-Mom...
-Sweet? You hate Stan.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.467
Not anymore.

11:34.533 --> 11:36.867
Now I love him.

11:36.934 --> 11:39.200
Love, love, love this man.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.400
Ma, what the hell is going on?

11:42.467 --> 11:44.900
Let me tell you something
I've never told a living soul.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.400
When I was unconscious,
hovering between life and death,

11:48.467 --> 11:51.633
I began a journey toward
a great white light.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.467
Along the way were all
the people who went before me.

11:54.533 --> 11:56.233
I saw my parents.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.767
I saw your father.

11:57.834 --> 12:01.133
I saw the Ritz brothers.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.266
Believe me,
they're much funnier dead.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.533
As I was about to enter the light,
a voice boomed,

12:08.600 --> 12:10.734
"Before you can enter
the gates of heaven,

12:10.800 --> 12:14.400
you must patch things up
with Stan."

12:14.467 --> 12:18.133
You see, babe?
It's all part of the big guy's plan.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.633
I am but a humble servant.

12:19.700 --> 12:24.233
Mr. Belvedere is a humble servant.
You're a horse's ass.

12:26.333 --> 12:29.033
(doorbell rings)

12:29.100 --> 12:30.500
Hey, big guy.

12:30.567 --> 12:33.600
Everybody, this is Dr Jerry.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.033
Dr. Jerry.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.567
It must be great
having just one name.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.934
You don't have to
worry about people

12:41.000 --> 12:43.033
misspelling your
last name all the time.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.000
Is yours difficult to spell?

12:45.066 --> 12:48.900
Yes, but I'm getting better at it.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.734
This must be our patient.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.900
No. It's the old paralyzed lady
on the couch.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.867
Doctor, I just don't understand.

12:56.934 --> 12:59.233
She was fine this morning.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.000
Ladies, could I ask you, please,
for complete silence?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.700
Never mind.
I thought I heard a radio.

13:09.767 --> 13:12.500
I'm trying to catch the score.

13:12.567 --> 13:14.867
Please get on with the examination.

13:14.934 --> 13:17.800
-Say ah.
-Ah.

13:17.867 --> 13:20.300
Yep. She's paralyzed.
That's it. What?

13:20.367 --> 13:24.433
-Get out! Out!
-Dorothy! Oh!

13:24.500 --> 13:27.533
Nice going! It's not easy getting him
for another house call.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.667
I can't believe you asked him
to examine my mother.

13:31.734 --> 13:35.066
That's one doctor whose bedside manner
I have no interest in.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.600
We definitely need
a second opinion.

13:37.667 --> 13:40.467
I wouldn't go to bed with him,
either, Dorothy.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.633
Ma, I am taking you to the hospital.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.800
-No.
-Why not?

13:47.867 --> 13:51.166
Are you telling me that possibly
there is nothing wrong with you?

13:51.233 --> 13:53.700
No. I feel better lying here.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.333
A car ride would
make me feel worse.

13:56.400 --> 14:01.000
Right. Sometimes lying motionless
is the best thing a person can do.

14:01.066 --> 14:03.533
That didn't sound right
on our honeymoon.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.133
It doesn't sound right now.

14:06.567 --> 14:09.700
(serene music playing)

14:15.400 --> 14:17.066
<i>There goes a ground ball</i>
<i>right up the middle.</i>

14:17.133 --> 14:19.166
<i>The shortstop should</i>
<i>have had that one.</i>

14:19.233 --> 14:22.467
I can cover more ground
than you in my wheelchair.

14:24.033 --> 14:26.033
(door closes)

14:38.867 --> 14:40.166
How you feeling, Ma?

14:40.233 --> 14:41.867
No improvement.

14:41.934 --> 14:43.400
Sorry.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.200
By the way, you're wearing your
knee brace on your neck.

14:52.734 --> 14:54.200
I know ma's faking.

14:54.266 --> 14:57.033
She's not really paralyzed.

14:57.100 --> 15:00.233
It's only natural
for you to feel that way.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.633
At the counseling center,

15:01.700 --> 15:05.633
we learned that the first reaction
to catastrophe is denial.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.633
Rose, I am not in denial.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.533
Yes, you are. You're just denying
you're in denial.

15:13.266 --> 15:17.233
Rose, I am not denying
that I am in denial.

15:17.300 --> 15:20.900
If you're not denying you're
in denial, then you're in denial.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.433
Look, fluff-head...

15:25.967 --> 15:30.500
why should I deny being in denial
when I never said I was in denial?

15:30.567 --> 15:34.767
You said I was in denial
and don't you deny it.

15:37.934 --> 15:42.567
I think your mother's faking.
What if she isn't?

15:42.633 --> 15:44.633
Put yourself in her position.

15:44.700 --> 15:48.133
Do you know how it hurts having
someone you love mistrust you?

15:48.200 --> 15:49.233
I do.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.367
I was telling a story.

15:51.433 --> 15:53.467
-I want to.
-Dorothy?

15:53.533 --> 15:57.100
Boy, this is a no-win situation.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.867
-But go ahead, Blanche.
-Well, fine.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.767
You may never get
to hear my story.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.467
Then I'm wrong.
It isn't a no-win situation.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.834
I was in high school,

16:12.900 --> 16:16.967
and I was having an affair with
a very handsome exchange student

16:17.033 --> 16:20.533
named Jean Pierre Fountainbleu.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.633
I think he was French or something.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.300
He was always sneering,
and he wore a beret.

16:26.367 --> 16:29.066
We weren't allowed
to wear berets in school.

16:29.133 --> 16:32.400
It was against the
St. Olaf dress code.

16:32.467 --> 16:35.900
I did wear a paper cap a lot.

16:35.967 --> 16:37.767
It was long and pointy.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.367
More a cone shape than a beret.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.867
Anyway,
Jean Pierre must have known

16:46.934 --> 16:48.567
about my reputation
for playing the field,

16:48.633 --> 16:52.266
because from the beginning,
he was convinced I wasn't faithful.

16:52.333 --> 16:55.700
He spied on me
and followed me home.

16:55.767 --> 16:59.433
He climbed the tree
outside my bedroom door,

16:59.500 --> 17:01.934
hoping to catch me in the act.

17:01.967 --> 17:04.166
What act?

17:04.233 --> 17:07.066
The second act of
<i>My Fair Lady,</i> Rose.

17:09.133 --> 17:12.066
I told Jean Pierre
I couldn't take it anymore.

17:12.133 --> 17:15.000
We broke up.
I was crushed.

17:15.066 --> 17:17.033
I guess you liked him.

17:17.100 --> 17:20.433
I liked the American
he was rooming with.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.400
We'd been having
an affair for months

17:23.467 --> 17:26.567
in the one place Jean Pierre
never looked.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.066
The Eiffel tower.

17:31.066 --> 17:34.233
It was in the Cutaway Oldsmobile

17:34.300 --> 17:37.266
they kept in the
driver's Ed. department.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.200
Lordy, the things I did in that car.

17:40.266 --> 17:43.900
It's a good thing St. Christopher
had his back to me.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.100
No. There's no doubt
about it. She's faking.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.734
I didn't learn to do that
until I was married.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.967
I meant ma, Blanche.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.033
And I'm going to go
prove it right now.

18:01.233 --> 18:04.567
Hiya, Ma. How are you doing? Ah! Oh!

18:04.633 --> 18:05.800
Oh, Ma, I feel dizzy.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.900
Oh, there's a pain
going up my arm.

18:08.967 --> 18:12.500
My chest! Ma! Oh!

18:12.567 --> 18:13.367
(doorbell rings)

18:13.433 --> 18:15.667
Will you answer the door, Dorothy,
please?

18:17.834 --> 18:20.266
Ma, it's my heart.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.533
Run into the kitchen and get help.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.467
Who am I, Lassie? Next you'll
order me into a burning barn.

18:26.533 --> 18:29.200
-(doorbell rings)
-I'm coming.

18:31.633 --> 18:33.900
Stanley,
my favorite ex-son-in-law.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.300
How was visiting the attorney?

18:35.367 --> 18:38.166
We've got to talk.
What's wrong with Dorothy?

18:38.233 --> 18:40.567
She's faking a heart attack.

18:41.567 --> 18:43.433
You won't get away with this.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.700
You're just doing it
for the settlement.

18:45.767 --> 18:48.433
What if I'm doing it for Sophia?

18:48.500 --> 18:52.367
Because you're a liar,
a cheat, and a scuzzball.

18:52.433 --> 18:55.033
Sure, dwell on the negative.

18:56.033 --> 18:58.667
Sophia, we've got a major problem.

18:58.734 --> 19:01.633
The insurance company won't
accept Dr. Jerry's medical report.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.533
Why?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.533
Something about
his prison record.

19:06.900 --> 19:10.400
They insist you be examined
by one of their physicians.

19:10.467 --> 19:11.767
This is a bummer.

19:11.834 --> 19:15.166
We've gotten this far
and it's falling apart.

19:15.233 --> 19:16.734
It's over.

19:19.533 --> 19:23.867
Stanley, Stanley, don't worry.

19:23.934 --> 19:26.934
I'm 82 years old.
My bones are brittle.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.500
My muscles are atrophied.

19:28.567 --> 19:33.333
My circulation's worse than
<i>U.S. News and World Report.</i>

19:33.400 --> 19:36.934
There's no physical they can give
that Sophia Petrillo can't fail.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.900
Ma.
I'll go tell the nurse you're here.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.900
That's a lovely chair.

19:54.967 --> 19:56.233
Oh, thank you.

19:56.300 --> 19:59.333
Oh, I'd give anything
for an electric wheelchair.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.100
I don't have the strength
to push this like I used to.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.133
Oh, that's too bad.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.633
If things go well,
I'll give you this chair.

20:07.700 --> 20:11.900
Oh, I wish I had
your positive attitude.

20:11.967 --> 20:14.633
The doctors told me
it's a waste of time.

20:14.700 --> 20:18.100
Doctors, what do they know?
They spend 20 years in medical school,

20:18.166 --> 20:21.367
and don't know to warm their hands
before they do a breast exam.

20:23.734 --> 20:27.533
Unfortunately, they do know
I'll never walk again.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.667
Oh.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.600
Stan, did you hear that?

20:31.667 --> 20:33.467
Yeah, terrible.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.133
Got any gum on you?

20:36.066 --> 20:38.000
Stan, these poor people.

20:38.066 --> 20:40.333
How can we take advantage
of this situation?

20:40.400 --> 20:41.900
Sophia, we've come this far.

20:41.967 --> 20:47.400
Think about the money so hard
that you block out everything else.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.900
Especially him.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.767
Hi, I'm Timmy.
What's your name?

20:54.834 --> 20:57.367
None of your business.
Leave her alone.

20:57.867 --> 21:02.900
The nurse wondered if you'd mind if
this little boy goes ahead of you.

21:02.967 --> 21:04.600
Oh, no problem.

21:04.667 --> 21:08.033
No, you need a doctor
as much as me.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.433
I'll wait my turn.

21:09.500 --> 21:13.100
No, kid. It's your turn.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.533
I don't need to see a doctor.

21:15.633 --> 21:18.066
You were right, Dorothy.
I was faking.

21:18.133 --> 21:19.667
Sophia, I'm shocked.

21:19.734 --> 21:21.266
Dorothy, I had no idea.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.266
I used to think you
were scum of the earth.

21:26.333 --> 21:29.367
I've just downgraded my opinion.

21:31.066 --> 21:33.800
What I did was wrong.
I feel humiliated

21:33.867 --> 21:35.633
in the presence of
you courageous people.

21:35.700 --> 21:38.934
I offer you my heartfelt sympathy.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.367
Well, everybody,
shall we forgive her?

21:42.433 --> 21:46.266
-Sure.
-All is forgiven.

21:53.467 --> 21:58.533
Ma, I'd like you to meet some of the
actors from the community theater.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.367
They'll be performing
<i>Cats</i> next month.

22:01.433 --> 22:03.834
And the kid's an actor too?

22:03.900 --> 22:08.867
Yes. Maybe you've seen him
in the Burger city commercial.

22:08.934 --> 22:12.000
Are you the boy who jumps
after getting two hamburgers

22:12.066 --> 22:13.867
for the price of one?

22:13.934 --> 22:16.367
You stunk.

22:16.433 --> 22:19.100
Come on. Let's go home.

22:20.900 --> 22:26.533
(serene music playing)

22:26.600 --> 22:28.500
Will you ever talk to me again?

22:28.567 --> 22:31.266
That was a mean, underhanded trick.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.834
I had no choice.

22:32.900 --> 22:37.567
It was like <i>The Exorcist.</i>
I was battling Stan for your soul.

22:38.834 --> 22:40.767
I'm off to rehearsal.

22:40.834 --> 22:43.033
It's so nice outside,
I think I'll walk.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.266
Like that?

22:44.333 --> 22:48.667
I'll probably take longer strides
when I get to the sidewalk.

22:50.433 --> 22:54.967
I meant her costume.
People will think she's nuts.

22:55.033 --> 22:57.600
They think she's nuts anyway.
This will confirm it.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.367
-(dog barks)
-Help! Help!

23:00.433 --> 23:02.567
Let me in! Help! Help!

23:02.633 --> 23:05.200
Whoa!

23:14.867 --> 23:16.500
Rose's in big trouble.
That's Dreyfuss.

23:16.567 --> 23:20.700
It took two guys to pry him off
the Steinbergs' plastic flamingos.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.133
(theme music playing)
