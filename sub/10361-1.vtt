01:09.786 --> 01:12.489
All right, here he comes.

01:12.589 --> 01:14.491
Now, this is the one you want.

01:14.591 --> 01:16.468
He'll make a fine specimen.

01:42.585 --> 01:44.155
Nice shooting.

01:46.823 --> 01:50.100
Now, let's get this thing on the truck
and get it over with.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.569
We almost finished here?

01:59.669 --> 02:02.081
You don't want to spend
too much time in one place.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.080
Once one croc spots you, they all come.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.613
This place is infested.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.281
Shut up, old man.

02:09.645 --> 02:11.548
These animals are gonna
make us all very rich.

02:11.648 --> 02:13.685
So just be patient.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.089
We're beginning the procedure now,
gentlemen.

02:19.189 --> 02:22.329
As long as we're getting on with it,

02:23.526 --> 02:25.328
I'll take my money.

02:25.428 --> 02:27.664
That wasn't the deal, Long John Silver.

02:27.764 --> 02:32.902
The deal was that
I get you and your people in here.

02:33.002 --> 02:34.204
I did that.

02:34.304 --> 02:38.514
The deal was you get us in and out.

02:40.310 --> 02:41.311
All right.

02:48.218 --> 02:49.619
This is only half the numbers.

02:49.719 --> 02:52.288
Yeah, Mama didn't raise no fool.

02:52.388 --> 02:55.062
You'll get the other half
when I get my money.

02:59.195 --> 03:01.731
All right, it's just
a little stick, sweetie.

03:01.831 --> 03:05.068
Why are you talking
to an anesthetized croc?

03:05.168 --> 03:06.374
It's an old habit.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.340
From my hospital days.

03:09.305 --> 03:13.309
I don't understand why we can't just
take this stuff back to the lab?

03:13.409 --> 03:15.545
And why does that snake have to be here?

03:15.645 --> 03:19.183
What we're doing here is very precise.

03:20.183 --> 03:21.253
Yikes!

03:23.253 --> 03:24.988
Once we've altered the structure,

03:25.088 --> 03:28.258
the manipulated DNA
becomes very fragile.

03:28.358 --> 03:33.363
So, an immediate implantation
into an egg-producing female

03:33.463 --> 03:36.166
will give us the best chance
for success.

03:36.266 --> 03:37.834
She's ready to lay her eggs.

03:37.934 --> 03:39.743
They just need to get fertilized.

03:40.670 --> 03:43.139
Now, these two smaller male snakes

03:43.239 --> 03:45.341
will provide the catalyst
for the procedure.

03:45.441 --> 03:48.811
Fine. So the snakes will mate.
Get on with it.

03:48.911 --> 03:51.687
Can I at least see the money?

03:59.922 --> 04:01.401
Excuse me. Watch the hook, man.

04:05.561 --> 04:06.665
Aren't you gonna count it?

04:07.897 --> 04:09.766
I trust that it's all there.

04:09.866 --> 04:13.439
I'd thumb through it, but no thumb.

04:15.772 --> 04:18.274
It's an awful lot of cash
just to get you to open a gate.

04:18.374 --> 04:20.743
And to keep my mouth shut.

04:20.843 --> 04:24.180
You see, without the proper motivation,

04:24.280 --> 04:27.350
I might just be tempted to call
Fish and Wildlife.

04:27.450 --> 04:31.421
Bet they'd be real interested
in exactly what you want

04:31.521 --> 04:34.468
with those protected crocodiles.

04:39.462 --> 04:43.467
You give Ms. Murdoch my regards.

04:44.033 --> 04:47.203
And boys,
you all be careful with these crocs.

04:47.303 --> 04:49.405
Take my word for it.

04:49.505 --> 04:51.610
First bite's always the worst.

04:52.608 --> 04:54.679
- Jim, we ain't done here yet.
- Firearms.

04:56.346 --> 04:58.681
And you still owe me
the last three numbers.

04:58.781 --> 05:01.227
- Okay.
- Pardon me. Crossing. Watch the gun.

05:02.952 --> 05:04.795
No problemo.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.068
I'm injecting her
with the mutated cells now.

05:22.972 --> 05:23.973
Finito.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.714
What now?

05:26.609 --> 05:29.818
Now? Now we wait
for the new cells to take.

05:30.613 --> 05:33.082
This female snake
is genetically engineered

05:33.182 --> 05:37.520
which means that all of her
biological process has been accelerated.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.389
She'll grow faster, molt faster.

05:39.489 --> 05:42.458
Lay eggs faster. Got it. How long?

05:42.558 --> 05:46.195
She should lay her eggs
in the next 24 to 48 hours.

05:46.295 --> 05:48.765
Dear God.

05:48.865 --> 05:51.668
Great. Wake me up
when it's time to go home.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.036
We'll get her back to the lab

05:53.136 --> 05:56.174
and everything else will be done
in an incubator. Okay?

06:01.344 --> 06:02.914
Our friend here is awake.

06:03.980 --> 06:06.149
That's not possible.
I gave that thing enough tranquilizer

06:06.249 --> 06:08.217
to knock out an elephant for 12 hours.

06:08.317 --> 06:09.762
You know this isn't an elephant, right?

06:12.422 --> 06:13.990
It's getting loose.

06:14.090 --> 06:15.398
It's getting loose!

06:56.399 --> 06:57.400
The snakes!

07:25.127 --> 07:26.128
Shit!

09:03.192 --> 09:04.500
Shit.

09:10.666 --> 09:12.270
Hey, Tully.

09:13.669 --> 09:15.771
New sunglasses? Nice.

09:15.871 --> 09:17.942
You know I can see the deer, right?

09:21.177 --> 09:23.157
Deer just jumped out
in front of my truck.

09:28.184 --> 09:29.788
What about the one in the back there?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.763
I forgot. There was two of them.

09:34.724 --> 09:36.359
You sure that's the story
you want to stick to?

09:36.459 --> 09:39.497
It's the God's honest truth this time.

09:40.796 --> 09:42.139
Isn't that a bullet hole?

09:45.935 --> 09:49.405
Looks like about a .308 there,
wouldn't you say?

09:49.505 --> 09:50.473
A .308?

09:50.573 --> 09:53.209
I don't know anything about ballistics.

09:53.309 --> 09:54.481
Ballistics?

09:55.978 --> 09:58.481
That's a real big word for you, Earl.
I'm impressed.

10:00.149 --> 10:02.720
Don't worry.
I know it wasn't you that shot him.

10:05.121 --> 10:06.355
Earl Junior!

10:06.455 --> 10:09.058
Why don't you come out
from behind that bush over there?

10:09.158 --> 10:12.162
Let's have a little chat before I have
to cart your old man off to jail.

10:14.463 --> 10:17.706
He's just a kid, Tully.
You're scaring him half to death.

10:20.136 --> 10:21.581
Poaching is poaching, Earl.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.512
You know the deal,

10:24.507 --> 10:25.747
the fine or the time.

10:26.242 --> 10:27.585
The fine.

10:30.079 --> 10:31.422
Have a nice day.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.123
That ain't no way to treat a citizen!

10:36.686 --> 10:38.359
First beer's on me later.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.155
Have you seen her?
Have you seen my baby?

11:13.255 --> 11:15.124
Daphne! Daphne!
Have you seen her? She's missing.

11:15.224 --> 11:16.567
- My baby.
- Get away from me, lady.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.240
- No.
- Sheriff! Sheriff, stop!

11:21.564 --> 11:24.400
Have you found her?
Have you found my baby?

11:24.500 --> 11:27.203
We're pretty sure that
she's with Jared, Mrs. Mailer.

11:27.303 --> 11:29.538
No, Sheriff, what if she's not with him?

11:29.638 --> 11:33.542
I told her to stay away
from that piece of trash.

11:33.642 --> 11:36.623
I'd cut that sucker's balls off
myself if I...

11:38.748 --> 11:41.083
If I could do it legally, that is.

11:41.183 --> 11:43.552
She's really a good girl, Sheriff.

11:43.652 --> 11:47.930
Yes, yes, I know. She's been an absolute doll
since she got out of jail this time.

11:48.924 --> 11:52.128
But, Sheriff, it's been two days.

11:52.228 --> 11:55.798
I'm not stupid. I watch reality TV.

11:55.898 --> 11:57.700
After the first 48 hours,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.303
it's practically a cold case.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.774
Okay. Well, we're doing
our best to locate her

12:04.874 --> 12:07.810
and I promise I'll be in touch
as soon as I hear something, okay?

12:07.910 --> 12:08.978
Thank you, Ms. Mailer.

12:09.078 --> 12:11.854
- You have a good day.
- Thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey!

12:12.414 --> 12:13.415
Stop!

12:18.053 --> 12:19.293
Sheriff.

12:19.922 --> 12:21.323
Mr. Mayor.

12:21.423 --> 12:22.858
What was that all about?

12:22.958 --> 12:24.232
Her daughter went missing.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.661
Last seen?

12:25.761 --> 12:27.763
Hiking outside the fence at Black Lake.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.900
- Outside the fence?
- Yes, sir.

12:31.267 --> 12:33.406
Is this something that
I should be worried about?

12:34.270 --> 12:36.939
Because if it is,
I'll have to call in a prescription.

12:37.039 --> 12:39.442
The daughter is a grown woman, sir.

12:39.542 --> 12:41.577
We think that she took off
with the boyfriend.

12:41.677 --> 12:45.682
The mother's not too fond of him.
But, we are considering other possibilities.

12:46.615 --> 12:47.750
Good.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.387
I gave you this job because
you know the town, its people,

12:51.487 --> 12:54.156
and to make sure that
the crocodiles at Black Lake

12:54.256 --> 12:56.125
don't cause any problems.

12:56.225 --> 13:00.329
You gave me this job, sir,
because nobody else wanted it.

13:00.429 --> 13:01.831
I sent Ferguson down to take a look.

13:01.931 --> 13:03.766
Ferguson?

13:03.866 --> 13:06.268
I have complete faith in your abilities.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.507
I'm behind you all the way.

13:09.104 --> 13:12.608
But if you screw up, I'll throw you
under the bus in a heartbeat.

13:13.175 --> 13:15.511
- Steve, how are you? Nice to see you.
- Mr. Mayor.

13:15.611 --> 13:16.712
Thanks for the building permit.

13:16.812 --> 13:19.793
Remember, it's an election year.

13:20.416 --> 13:23.488
Ice cream! The mayor has coupons
for free ice cream!

13:24.186 --> 13:26.393
- Coupons for free ice cream, everyone!
- What the...

13:33.062 --> 13:34.666
Sheriff, can you hear me?

13:35.698 --> 13:37.678
Yeah, Ferguson, where are you?

13:38.734 --> 13:39.769
Is that you?

13:40.402 --> 13:43.773
Yeah. Go ahead, Ferguson,
before I kick your ass.

13:43.873 --> 13:44.940
Yeah, roger that.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.344
We are combing the perimeter fence
just like you instructed.

13:48.444 --> 13:49.612
Find anything?

13:49.712 --> 13:50.884
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.748
Is it Daphne Mailer?

13:52.848 --> 13:54.054
No, ma'am.

13:55.017 --> 13:57.395
You need to see this for yourself.

13:58.821 --> 14:00.689
Okay, since we're playing this game,

14:00.789 --> 14:02.758
secure the scene. I'm on my way.

14:02.858 --> 14:04.201
Roger that.

14:06.695 --> 14:07.969
Secure the scene!

14:36.158 --> 14:38.001
I can't believe she would
use this picture of me.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.900
Yo, Daphne! Open the door.

14:42.765 --> 14:44.403
Wait, I got the key.

14:46.001 --> 14:48.504
- Where the hell have you been?
- Hey!

14:48.604 --> 14:50.105
You scared the hell out of me.

14:50.205 --> 14:51.582
Look at this.

14:52.174 --> 14:53.275
Cool.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.311
Look at the picture! I look like a pig!

14:55.411 --> 14:57.446
My mom picked the worst photo
she could find of me.

14:57.546 --> 14:59.348
Boo-boo, you look good.

14:59.448 --> 15:00.583
Good and fat.

15:00.683 --> 15:02.959
No, you look good, real good.

15:03.719 --> 15:05.487
You look hot,

15:05.587 --> 15:07.623
you look sexy.

15:07.723 --> 15:09.358
Girl, you look smart.

15:09.458 --> 15:12.837
Wait, you really think I'm smart?

15:13.495 --> 15:15.805
Yeah, you got a GED.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.368
You know, there's something
I really like

15:19.468 --> 15:23.245
about a guy that appreciates me
for my mind and not just my body.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.175
Okay.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.509
Baby.

15:29.979 --> 15:30.980
What?

15:32.114 --> 15:33.320
Okay.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.990
Yeah. Okay. Come on.

15:38.787 --> 15:40.698
- Baby, you said you like it rough.
- Yeah.

15:42.491 --> 15:44.198
Sorta. Okay.

15:44.827 --> 15:45.862
Baby!

15:49.531 --> 15:51.977
Okay. Just a little less.

15:52.768 --> 15:53.769
Yeah.

16:03.112 --> 16:05.285
- Where have you been?
- I've been walking all night.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.616
- What do you mean?
- They got out.

16:07.716 --> 16:08.817
What do you mean, "They got out"?

16:08.917 --> 16:10.586
They're loose.

16:10.686 --> 16:13.667
- Get to my office immediately.
- Roger that.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.292
Whose fault is that?

16:16.392 --> 16:18.928
I ain't taking the fall
for what went on out there.

16:19.028 --> 16:21.997
I'm not asking you
to take the fall, Mr. Beach.

16:22.097 --> 16:23.866
But you will help me get them back.

16:23.966 --> 16:25.167
Wait, I'm gonna what?

16:25.267 --> 16:29.271
Those snakes are a very rare,
very endangered species.

16:29.371 --> 16:31.607
They are monsters, is what they are.

16:31.707 --> 16:37.157
Yes. Well, they also represent
billions of dollars to this company.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.716
Have you ever heard of the Blood Orchid?

16:40.816 --> 16:42.318
Can't say I have.

16:42.718 --> 16:43.953
It's a tropical species.

16:44.053 --> 16:45.327
Very rare.

16:45.954 --> 16:49.291
My father discovered
that the orchid extract,

16:49.391 --> 16:53.862
when mixed with the particular secretions
of a molting giant anaconda

16:53.962 --> 16:57.433
created a compound
capable of regenerating cells.

16:57.533 --> 16:59.468
Cell regeneration?

16:59.568 --> 17:03.105
I'm talking about biological immortality,
Mr. Beach.

17:03.205 --> 17:06.811
Imagine what people would be
willing to pay to live forever.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.444
Anything.

17:09.545 --> 17:11.012
But there was a problem.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.983
A protein bond triggers
cell regeneration in reptiles.

17:14.083 --> 17:17.319
Unfortunately, it doesn't work
the same way in humans.

17:17.419 --> 17:19.126
So, how does it work?

17:20.055 --> 17:22.535
It becomes lethally toxic.

17:23.659 --> 17:25.594
Do I still have your attention?

17:25.694 --> 17:27.731
Absolutely.

17:28.097 --> 17:31.100
Before he died,
my father found a solution

17:31.200 --> 17:33.502
but it required creating a hybrid.

17:33.602 --> 17:36.939
And with that
you get your fountain of youth?

17:37.039 --> 17:40.843
Unfortunately,
the only compatible reptile on Earth

17:40.943 --> 17:43.746
is as rare as the orchid itself.

17:43.846 --> 17:45.147
A species of crocodile.

17:45.247 --> 17:48.017
Enormous, aggressive.

17:48.117 --> 17:50.853
And they can only be found
one place on Earth.

17:50.953 --> 17:53.822
Yeah, I know. I fought with one.

17:53.922 --> 17:57.292
Gather your men, Mr. Beach.
We're going back there.

17:57.392 --> 17:59.995
We're gonna find that snake
before she lays her eggs

18:00.095 --> 18:03.167
or someone or something
gets to her first.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.704
I need those baby crocacondas alive.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.205
You're listening to Monster Rock on Q95.

18:10.305 --> 18:11.648
You're listening to Monster Rock on Q95.

18:24.953 --> 18:27.756
There's no way you got 2,200
on your SATs.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.769
I did. I swear. I'm, like, a genius.

18:31.627 --> 18:33.732
No. Actually, you're like, terrifying.

18:34.796 --> 18:35.898
- It's so wrong.
- Whatever.

18:35.998 --> 18:38.367
I only got, like, 1,900.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.539
And somehow they still let you
into vocational school.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.448
What about you?
What'd you get on your SATs?

18:48.810 --> 18:50.312
Right around 2,350.

18:50.412 --> 18:51.847
- What?
- What? You're full of it.

18:51.947 --> 18:54.450
Hey, hey, hey. Don't hate.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.154
Yeah.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.969
Goody, it's Tiff!

19:09.264 --> 19:10.732
Hey, big sister.

19:10.832 --> 19:13.904
Put me on speaker.
Everybody needs to hear this.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.738
Okay, bitches,

19:16.838 --> 19:19.942
it's time to put down your phones
and that copy of Girl Mag

19:20.042 --> 19:21.248
and listen the hell up.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.379
My phone.

19:24.479 --> 19:26.686
The bitch can't talk right now.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.324
Are you slow?

19:30.786 --> 19:31.920
Slow?

19:32.020 --> 19:34.591
No, no, I'm seriously asking
if you're stupid.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.159
Like, mentally challenged?

19:37.259 --> 19:40.429
Because I need to know
what I'm dealing with.

19:40.529 --> 19:44.399
I mean, seriously,
what the hell do you think this is?

19:44.499 --> 19:47.402
What I see in front of me
are a bunch of stupid little girls

19:47.502 --> 19:51.306
who think they have what it takes
to become Delta Phi Beta sisters.

19:51.406 --> 19:54.042
And I can tell you right now, they...

19:54.142 --> 19:56.545
- Are wrong!
- Are wrong!

19:56.645 --> 19:59.148
You are some sorry-ass losers.

20:00.382 --> 20:01.950
If you want to get in,

20:02.050 --> 20:05.259
you're gonna have to prove yourselves.

20:20.002 --> 20:22.642
I thought I had lost you,
my little friend.

20:25.841 --> 20:27.643
Are you calling your boyfriend?

20:27.743 --> 20:29.811
What's his name? Maybe I know him.

20:29.911 --> 20:33.382
Since when did you ever need to know
a guy's name before you do him?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.052
Whatever.

20:42.124 --> 20:43.158
This is Tully.

20:43.258 --> 20:44.326
Hey, Dad.

20:44.426 --> 20:47.162
Hey, sweetie, how are you doing?

20:47.262 --> 20:48.935
What ya doing?

20:49.097 --> 20:55.104
I just stopped by the house real quick
to try and grab a quick snack.

20:56.305 --> 20:57.613
You miss me yet?

20:58.206 --> 21:00.676
Of course I miss you, honey.
I mean, you're off at college

21:00.776 --> 21:03.620
and then I'm here all alone.

21:04.579 --> 21:07.182
I think they call it
empty nest syndrome.

21:07.282 --> 21:09.351
Shut up, you probably
already turned my room

21:09.451 --> 21:11.556
into a man cave or something.

21:12.954 --> 21:16.024
Yes, indeed,
I just hung a flat screen up in there.

21:16.124 --> 21:17.226
Got it all cleaned up.

21:17.326 --> 21:20.362
Put a La-Z-Boy in there.
I got a little mini fridge.

21:20.462 --> 21:24.672
I am set for football season.
You have no idea.

21:26.034 --> 21:29.671
That sounds great. All you need now
is a dog to lay by your feet.

21:29.771 --> 21:31.341
I would love that.

21:33.742 --> 21:35.244
So, what's up, babe?

21:35.777 --> 21:38.714
Just keeping to our agreement.
Checking in.

21:38.814 --> 21:40.415
Thought I'd let you know
that I'm going to

21:40.515 --> 21:43.018
rush weekend with the sorority girls.

21:43.118 --> 21:46.121
Right, I completely forgot about that.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.556
Where you guys going?

21:47.656 --> 21:49.567
We're going up to Clear Lake.

21:50.292 --> 21:51.965
You don't have to worry.

21:52.794 --> 21:54.796
Just do me a favor and just let me know

21:54.896 --> 21:56.598
when you're heading
back to the dorms, okay?

21:56.698 --> 21:58.033
Okay.

21:58.133 --> 21:59.835
All right. I love you.

21:59.935 --> 22:01.303
I love you, too.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.746
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

22:59.227 --> 23:00.529
I'm hungry.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.973
I'm gonna go back to the truck
and get a snack.

23:03.965 --> 23:07.174
Hey. Bring me some Cheez Doodles.

23:07.869 --> 23:09.371
Okay, Dad.

23:51.179 --> 23:55.525
Anything but crocodiles.
Please let it be anything but crocodiles.

24:20.575 --> 24:22.611
What the hell is going on here?

24:22.711 --> 24:24.446
Well,

24:24.546 --> 24:27.425
yeah, the forensics
are still going over it.

24:28.517 --> 24:29.825
But it could be arson.

24:29.951 --> 24:31.319
Arson?

24:31.419 --> 24:33.456
Does this look like arson
to you, Ferguson?

24:35.924 --> 24:37.826
Maybe not.

24:37.926 --> 24:41.029
Find any bodies? Daphne Mailer, maybe?

24:41.129 --> 24:42.898
Well, we have one...

24:42.998 --> 24:45.467
- Ferguson, just a little personal space here.
- Sorry.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.970
We have one partial set
of human remains.

24:49.070 --> 24:52.207
What isn't still attached
is probably inside the...

24:52.307 --> 24:53.542
- You know...
- The crocodile?

24:53.642 --> 24:56.384
You can say it, Ferguson,
just not too loudly.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.481
Well, while we're here,
we might as well be sure.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.349
Cut him open.

25:01.449 --> 25:03.852
I'm not really good with,
with sharp things.

25:03.952 --> 25:05.754
But I can get you a set of gloves.

25:05.854 --> 25:08.061
No, no, that's okay.

25:08.890 --> 25:10.961
My hands have been in
some pretty nasty places.

25:48.730 --> 25:51.233
Okay, bag those up. Get me some DNA.

25:51.333 --> 25:54.177
I want to make sure that
they don't match our missing person.

25:55.937 --> 25:57.007
Yes, ma'am.

26:06.348 --> 26:07.649
Hello, everyone.

26:07.749 --> 26:09.417
- Hey, Mayor.
- Nice to see you, Bob.

26:09.517 --> 26:10.852
- How's the game going?
- Good, sir.

26:10.952 --> 26:11.987
Working on the handicap?

26:12.087 --> 26:13.157
- You got it.
- Good boy.

26:14.222 --> 26:15.790
What the hell is going on here?

26:15.890 --> 26:17.692
I heard the call on the scanner
in my office.

26:17.792 --> 26:19.465
Okay, I have it under control.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.699
You call that under control?

26:24.799 --> 26:26.608
I don't call this under control.

26:27.369 --> 26:29.671
And you're gonna call Fish and Wildlife

26:29.771 --> 26:32.908
before anybody gets
what's going on around here.

26:33.008 --> 26:36.144
I don't have to tell you that
November's just around the corner

26:36.244 --> 26:38.053
and my ass is on the line.

26:38.513 --> 26:39.685
Just take care of it.

26:40.615 --> 26:43.718
All right, everybody,
the mayor is leaving. See you later!

26:43.818 --> 26:45.854
- Bob, take care. Remember, Sunday picnic.
- Yep.

26:45.954 --> 26:47.289
- Bring the kids.
- You have a good day, too.

26:47.389 --> 26:49.995
- I'll be there, sir.
- Keep up the good work, everyone.

27:08.943 --> 27:10.149
All right.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.192
Sweetie, two times in one day?

27:17.452 --> 27:20.365
I do have unlimited minutes.
Sweetie? Do I know you?

27:22.290 --> 27:24.593
I am really sorry.

27:24.693 --> 27:27.696
You know what?
I thought you were my daughter.

27:27.796 --> 27:30.675
Could be. My mom dated a lot of guys.

27:31.299 --> 27:32.300
What?

27:33.134 --> 27:34.669
This is the Aroostook County sheriff.

27:34.769 --> 27:37.113
Am I speaking with
Will Tull, Fish and Wildlife?

27:37.372 --> 27:40.508
Yes, this is Will Tull.
My friends call me Tully.

27:40.608 --> 27:44.279
Well, Tully, I'm Reba
and I don't have any friends,

27:44.379 --> 27:46.181
so you can call me Reba.

27:46.281 --> 27:48.583
Yes, I'm familiar with who you are.

27:48.683 --> 27:50.822
I think I'll stick with Sheriff for now.

27:52.554 --> 27:54.534
How much do you know about crocodiles?

28:42.837 --> 28:44.639
- Did you get another tattoo?
- I totally did.

28:44.739 --> 28:45.974
- Let me see.
- I had to.

28:46.074 --> 28:47.142
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's just small.

28:47.242 --> 28:50.086
- I didn't want anything really big.
- This is really good.

28:53.248 --> 28:56.251
What do you think this is? A vacation?

28:56.351 --> 28:58.262
You are all useless.

28:58.853 --> 29:00.989
All right, bitches, on the line!

29:01.089 --> 29:02.659
Get on the line right now!

29:10.598 --> 29:12.300
That's better.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.270
I happen to know
that none of my DPB sisters

29:15.370 --> 29:17.539
or brothers at Kappa Tau Pi

29:17.639 --> 29:20.375
are gonna want anything to do
with any of you

29:20.475 --> 29:22.614
if you all suck.

29:23.244 --> 29:25.714
And right now, you do.

29:25.814 --> 29:29.050
That's it, you're out.
You didn't make it. Come on. Leave!

29:29.150 --> 29:31.286
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
You can get back in line.

29:31.386 --> 29:32.797
Get back in line!

29:33.721 --> 29:35.758
Now get in the water.

29:36.758 --> 29:39.360
I don't think any guy minds if we suck,

29:39.460 --> 29:42.202
if you get my politically
incorrect innuendo.

29:44.098 --> 29:45.839
What are you all waiting for?

29:47.001 --> 29:49.345
Are you afraid of the crocodiles?

29:51.172 --> 29:53.942
I cannot believe
you are all this stupid.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.350
This is Clear Lake.

29:55.944 --> 29:58.913
There are no crocodiles in Clear Lake.

29:59.013 --> 30:01.994
The crocodiles are in Black Lake.

30:02.183 --> 30:05.289
Now get in the water!

30:06.588 --> 30:07.989
Go on.

30:08.089 --> 30:10.262
Get your asses in there!

30:11.759 --> 30:13.762
Where do you think you're going?

30:13.862 --> 30:15.997
- But you said to...
- And what was your name again?

30:16.097 --> 30:17.065
Jane.

30:17.165 --> 30:18.166
Jane?

30:18.967 --> 30:20.869
As in plain Jane?

30:20.969 --> 30:23.108
As in Goldsburg.

30:24.105 --> 30:27.780
You have 20 minutes to dig a hole
big enough to bury your sorry ass in.

30:36.184 --> 30:37.754
Are you both deaf?

30:38.553 --> 30:42.558
Or maybe you really don't have
what it takes to become a Delta Phi Beta.

30:44.058 --> 30:47.062
I've got my eye on both of you.

30:49.364 --> 30:54.335
Is that even possible,
to have one singular eye on both of us?

30:54.435 --> 30:55.709
I don't think so.

31:00.708 --> 31:01.948
It's gonna be fine.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.748
It's so cold.

31:05.046 --> 31:07.492
Move it. You don't want to piss her off.

31:08.149 --> 31:10.652
Let's go, guys. Go.

31:10.752 --> 31:12.987
It's a beach, bitches!

31:13.087 --> 31:17.035
Walk until you can't touch the bottom
and tread water until I say stop.

31:19.093 --> 31:20.094
Go!

31:20.194 --> 31:22.765
Looks like Megan's already halfway
to becoming a sister.

31:30.705 --> 31:32.685
That's it. Keep swimming.

31:58.533 --> 32:01.912
Let's hear it for Brett and Andrew
from Kappa Tau Pi!

32:02.570 --> 32:03.671
Go, guys!

32:03.771 --> 32:06.274
Great performance, guys!

32:06.374 --> 32:08.610
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

32:08.710 --> 32:09.744
That was crazy.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.619
Bro, that was awesome!

32:12.814 --> 32:15.016
I'm sure the girls will show you
their appreciation later,

32:15.116 --> 32:16.651
if you get my meaning.

32:16.751 --> 32:18.151
All right!

32:28.863 --> 32:31.139
I'll give you 10 seconds
to move your vehicle.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.869
I'm here meeting the sheriff.

32:34.969 --> 32:37.405
It's your lucky day. You found her.

32:37.505 --> 32:40.541
I know. I'm Will Tull.
Fish and Wildlife.

32:40.641 --> 32:42.677
Tull! Just the man
we've been waiting for.

32:42.777 --> 32:44.415
You still got to move your vehicle.

32:49.751 --> 32:50.786
Oh, boy.

32:54.355 --> 32:55.527
Here we go.

32:56.157 --> 32:58.026
So, you have an ID yet?

32:58.126 --> 33:01.198
No ID, but I can tell you the legs
do belong to the rest of him.

33:01.362 --> 33:03.197
How can you be sure?

33:03.297 --> 33:06.369
You'll have to forgive me.
This is the only time I have to eat my lunch.

33:07.969 --> 33:09.073
Wing Ding?

33:10.705 --> 33:12.340
Thanks, but no.

33:12.440 --> 33:13.942
You can tell by the break.

33:14.509 --> 33:16.844
Clearly the legs were torn off
with tremendous force

33:16.944 --> 33:18.252
coming down on the femurs.

33:18.846 --> 33:21.383
But here, you can see how they match.

33:22.817 --> 33:23.785
Yeah.

33:23.885 --> 33:25.853
And you're absolutely certain
that he's a he?

33:25.953 --> 33:26.921
No question.

33:27.021 --> 33:28.957
Well, how long before
you can give me a name?

33:29.057 --> 33:30.593
I got no usable prints.

33:31.559 --> 33:34.733
Possibility of dental records,
but that could take weeks, even longer.

33:35.163 --> 33:36.608
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

33:56.084 --> 33:57.222
Sorry.

33:57.952 --> 33:58.953
Thanks.

34:02.690 --> 34:04.625
Did they find what was left
of the lab unit?

34:04.725 --> 34:07.061
Even if they have, there's no way
they can connect it to us.

34:07.161 --> 34:08.161
I made sure.

34:08.830 --> 34:10.810
You better hope so for all our sakes.

34:11.666 --> 34:13.043
Eyes front.

34:14.001 --> 34:15.069
So, what's the plan?

34:15.168 --> 34:16.603
What a bitch.

34:16.704 --> 34:19.873
A couple of days ago I had our tech guys
block their tracking device

34:19.974 --> 34:21.743
so only ours will work.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.911
So we're the only ones
that can track these things?

34:24.011 --> 34:25.580
Bingo.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.449
We'll use this to find the female
and bring her back to the lab.

34:28.549 --> 34:29.751
And if we can't?

34:29.851 --> 34:31.888
This is a portable incubator.

34:33.121 --> 34:35.857
If we can't bring her back to the lab,
we'll take her eggs.

34:35.956 --> 34:39.694
Whatever happens,
we can't have her lay them in the wild.

34:39.793 --> 34:41.501
Those eggs are the key to the serum.

34:42.096 --> 34:44.132
And what if she does lay them
in the wild?

34:44.799 --> 34:46.505
I don't want to know.

34:48.101 --> 34:50.804
I guess we're gonna
need Bickerman again.

34:50.905 --> 34:52.940
No one knows the land like him.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.943
Well, he does have a bag
full of my money.

34:56.043 --> 34:58.580
I think it's about time
Captain Hook earned it.

35:04.552 --> 35:07.465
The good news is
it's not our missing person.

35:07.822 --> 35:10.425
The bad news is that
our missing person is still missing.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.472
Finding a dead guy inside of a croc
isn't bad news enough?

35:13.961 --> 35:15.596
Spend a little time with us, Mr. Tull,

35:15.696 --> 35:18.466
and you'll find that it's just another day
at the office around here.

35:18.566 --> 35:19.867
What'd you got on the tractor trailer?

35:19.967 --> 35:23.504
Unfortunately, not much.
The license plates melted in the fire.

35:23.604 --> 35:25.173
Can't even get a readable VIN number.

35:25.273 --> 35:27.208
The guys at the garage
are taking it apart

35:27.308 --> 35:29.720
to see if they can get
some serial numbers off the engine.

35:30.244 --> 35:31.746
Might be able to trace it from there.

35:31.846 --> 35:33.147
All right. Well, keep on it.

35:33.247 --> 35:36.984
Yes sir, ma'am.
I mean, Sheriff. Sheriff.

35:37.084 --> 35:39.086
Mr. Tull, what do you need from us
to get started?

35:39.754 --> 35:41.989
Well, first things first.

35:42.089 --> 35:44.296
Probably best to go ahead
and show me what you've got.

36:41.849 --> 36:43.084
Boo!

36:43.184 --> 36:45.486
Oh, my God, you scared me.

36:45.586 --> 36:48.289
Well, with your ear buds in
and your eyes closed,

36:48.389 --> 36:51.131
Sasquatch and his whole family
could sneak up on you.

36:52.226 --> 36:55.429
Here, it's the only thing
I could find to actually drink.

36:55.529 --> 36:56.797
Thanks.

36:56.897 --> 36:59.571
Unless you want to join
the vomit patrol over there?

37:05.773 --> 37:07.150
I'm okay.

37:09.777 --> 37:11.120
Okay, let's do it.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.815
Neanderthals.

37:17.051 --> 37:19.053
I'm surprised they don't
drag them off by their hair.

37:21.889 --> 37:24.870
Why are you here?
You don't seem like the type.

37:25.593 --> 37:28.733
What, can't you tell
that I live to be a Delta?

37:28.896 --> 37:30.498
Paint each other's toenails,

37:30.598 --> 37:32.633
call each other sisters and BFFs?

37:32.733 --> 37:34.135
Compare each other's boob jobs?

37:34.235 --> 37:35.670
- Stop.
- Get a daring

37:35.770 --> 37:38.139
butterfly tattoo on our ankles.

37:38.239 --> 37:39.874
- Okay, stop.
- Pierce our unmentionables.

37:39.974 --> 37:41.976
Seriously, stop.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.521
Really, why are you here?

37:46.347 --> 37:49.920
Truth is I'm a psych major.

37:50.918 --> 37:54.923
And I mean, what is more psycho
then wanting to join a sorority?

37:56.190 --> 37:57.828
Great resource material.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.604
I'm bored! Make them swim.

38:05.099 --> 38:07.045
Get in the water.

38:10.137 --> 38:11.772
Come on. Go. Go.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.041
Get in, bitches.

38:14.141 --> 38:16.644
News flash, you stupid bitches!

38:16.744 --> 38:19.647
Frats don't like boring
sorority sisters.

38:19.747 --> 38:21.522
Now, get in the water!

38:23.050 --> 38:24.518
What about you, girlfriend?

38:24.618 --> 38:26.354
What's your excuse?

38:26.454 --> 38:30.424
I'm a legacy. My mom was a Delta.

38:30.524 --> 38:32.927
So, what, she, like,
forced you into it or something?

38:33.027 --> 38:34.472
No.

38:35.062 --> 38:36.735
She died when I was little.

38:37.264 --> 38:39.600
It was just me and my dad.

38:39.700 --> 38:43.705
So I thought that becoming a Delta
would be something to remember her by.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.841
That's sweet.

38:46.941 --> 38:49.353
I mean, I want to throw up.

38:50.678 --> 38:52.713
But it's sweet. Seriously.

38:52.813 --> 38:55.082
Don't think I don't see you two
sitting over here snickering

38:55.182 --> 38:56.784
or laughing or whatever.

38:56.884 --> 38:59.364
You do know that those words
mean the same thing, right?

38:59.954 --> 39:02.757
What I do know is that
you are two of the sorriest pledges

39:02.857 --> 39:04.725
I have ever seen in my life.

39:04.825 --> 39:07.228
And if you want a hope in hell
of getting into this sorority,

39:07.328 --> 39:09.330
you better get it together.

39:12.733 --> 39:16.476
Well, let's take one
for Mom and my studies.

39:26.814 --> 39:28.149
This is a mess.

39:28.249 --> 39:30.818
- This happened last night?
- Right about then.

39:30.918 --> 39:33.754
We don't get many eyewitnesses out here
in the middle of the night,

39:33.854 --> 39:34.889
which, I'm sure, was the point.

39:35.689 --> 39:38.392
I'm not gonna candy coat this
for you, Sheriff.

39:38.492 --> 39:39.994
If this fence was down for even an hour,

39:40.094 --> 39:42.663
it's entirely possible that
some of the crocs escaped.

39:42.763 --> 39:46.000
I mean, there's a chance
we can track some of them, but...

39:46.100 --> 39:47.511
Then what are we waiting for?

39:50.938 --> 39:55.076
Well, I mean, you obviously
know a lot about breeding.

39:55.176 --> 39:56.519
Excuse me?

39:57.144 --> 39:58.312
That came out wrong.

39:58.412 --> 40:00.790
Let me clarify that.

40:01.615 --> 40:03.150
Aroostook Station Wildlife.

40:03.250 --> 40:06.120
Hey, Sheryl, it's Tully.
I'm out here at Black Lake,

40:06.220 --> 40:08.122
just trying to take my foot
out of my mouth.

40:08.222 --> 40:09.223
You do that a lot, Tully.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.425
If you could do me a solid
and get Falmouth on the line

40:11.525 --> 40:14.128
and have them send over
all the transponder numbers

40:14.228 --> 40:17.365
for the crocs they tagged
out here on their last survey,

40:17.465 --> 40:18.833
that would be great.

40:18.933 --> 40:21.102
And if you could make it snappy,
I would be very happy.

40:21.202 --> 40:23.771
We could have a very serious situation
on our hands here.

40:23.871 --> 40:25.942
- I don't know, I'll pass it on.
- Okay.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.409
- Yep. Thanks.
- Tully, what about that raise I...

40:28.509 --> 40:30.546
Okay, bye, bye. Bye. Bye.

40:32.580 --> 40:34.148
What I was saying earlier is that

40:34.248 --> 40:36.117
any crocs that were born
after they were tagged

40:36.217 --> 40:37.651
aren't gonna have any transponders.

40:37.751 --> 40:39.120
So we're gonna have to hunt
the old-fashioned way.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.187
And if we're gonna do that,

40:40.287 --> 40:42.893
it's gonna take a lot more than
that peashooter to stop 'em.

40:43.457 --> 40:44.992
Don't you worry about me.

40:45.092 --> 40:47.928
If there's one thing I'm good at,
it's stopping crocodiles.

40:48.028 --> 40:49.530
So I've heard.

40:50.464 --> 40:51.565
All right.

40:51.665 --> 40:55.909
Here's a list of all the transponders
that they tagged the crocs with.

40:56.203 --> 40:57.338
Looks like a lot.

40:57.438 --> 41:00.841
Yeah, but this is not right.

41:00.941 --> 41:03.387
This is last week's readout. Hold on.

41:04.712 --> 41:05.713
What the hell?

41:07.181 --> 41:09.517
The whole system went down.

41:09.617 --> 41:10.618
Is that normal?

41:10.985 --> 41:14.355
Well, it's never gone down on me before,
so to speak.

41:14.455 --> 41:16.490
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

41:16.590 --> 41:19.193
- That's kind of convenient timing.
- Not really.

41:19.293 --> 41:23.364
Well, I mean, a bizarre accident
blows a hole in our security gate

41:23.464 --> 41:25.967
around the same time
the tracking system goes down.

41:27.535 --> 41:30.277
We don't even know
how many crocs have escaped, if any.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.706
True, true.
We don't know how many escaped,

41:32.806 --> 41:34.909
but we do know where they're going.

41:35.009 --> 41:37.578
Check this out. Pull up this map.

41:37.678 --> 41:39.513
All right. This is us.

41:39.613 --> 41:40.915
And here's Black Lake.

41:41.015 --> 41:42.850
Now I'm willing to bet
they've probably consumed

41:42.950 --> 41:45.119
most of the lake's resources, so,

41:45.219 --> 41:47.922
the crocs are gonna be headed
toward the nearest source of ready food,

41:48.022 --> 41:51.592
which is right there.

41:51.692 --> 41:52.693
Clear Lake.

42:08.776 --> 42:09.777
Hey!

42:24.491 --> 42:26.360
Where do you want us to start?

42:26.460 --> 42:27.461
Start in there.

42:27.561 --> 42:29.463
That's where we found him
the first time.

42:29.563 --> 42:31.665
If we're lucky,
he'll be drinking his way through

42:31.765 --> 42:33.767
that money we gave him.

42:34.068 --> 42:35.604
You two wait out here.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.806
Try to blend in with the locals.

42:38.906 --> 42:40.613
I'll go around the back.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.116
What's up?

42:45.946 --> 42:47.152
What's up?

42:54.488 --> 42:56.866
Come on, Beth, answer the phone, please.

42:57.725 --> 42:58.893
Look, just try to relax.

42:58.993 --> 43:02.029
You know, she's probably out
having some fun with friends.

43:02.129 --> 43:03.998
Besides, we don't even know
if the crocs did escape

43:04.098 --> 43:05.766
or even if they made it to Clear Lake.

43:05.866 --> 43:08.969
Look, I'm not gonna be able to relax
until I know my daughter is safe.

43:09.069 --> 43:11.605
So, I'm gonna go look for her.

43:11.705 --> 43:13.309
We're working here, Tull.

43:14.642 --> 43:18.279
Once that fence is fixed, your lake is safe.
I can't say the same thing about my daughter.

43:18.379 --> 43:20.985
So, I'm gonna go try and find her,
you can come or not.

43:22.082 --> 43:23.220
I'm coming!

43:57.685 --> 43:59.323
I was never here.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.593
You got it, boss.

44:15.869 --> 44:18.440
- Hey, buddy, what can I get you?
- I'm looking for Jim Bickerman.

44:19.406 --> 44:22.546
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim who?

44:27.281 --> 44:29.416
I'm still having a hard time
with that last name.

44:29.516 --> 44:30.790
Bickersteen?

44:34.188 --> 44:35.923
Bickerman. Jimmy Bickerman.

44:36.023 --> 44:37.400
Why didn't you say so?

44:38.759 --> 44:40.067
Haven't seen him.

44:50.137 --> 44:51.405
Hi, Jim.

44:51.505 --> 44:53.674
Happy hour start a little early today?

44:53.774 --> 44:57.085
Don't hassle me, Ms. Murdoch.
I'm a cripple.

44:58.579 --> 45:00.889
Physically challenged
is the preferred term now.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.964
I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

45:09.923 --> 45:13.166
Come on, Jim.
We still have business to discuss.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.202
Let me help you up.

45:19.399 --> 45:20.668
Did you see that?

45:20.768 --> 45:22.635
I think I got me a lawsuit here.

45:31.044 --> 45:33.786
- He's actually kind of cute.
- Yeah.

45:35.082 --> 45:36.083
You ready?

45:37.184 --> 45:39.130
- Born ready.
- Yeah.

45:41.955 --> 45:45.426
Ladies, Andrew is gonna
give Hannah here...

45:45.526 --> 45:47.261
- Heather.
- Close enough.

45:47.361 --> 45:48.999
A show to remember.

45:51.765 --> 45:53.167
Damn, it's cold.

45:53.267 --> 45:55.213
- I'm gonna go up front.
- Yeah.

45:59.773 --> 46:03.448
Baby, you know tops are
optional on my boat.

46:04.945 --> 46:06.686
Does that line really work?

46:08.515 --> 46:10.791
Well, I am the captain.

46:16.523 --> 46:17.695
You handle the throttle.

46:17.858 --> 46:18.928
Hit it!

46:37.778 --> 46:39.348
Yeah, baby.

46:45.118 --> 46:46.563
Let's go over there.

46:52.559 --> 46:56.132
What? I'm serious. You're so much hotter
than the other girls.

47:00.033 --> 47:01.774
How about a little suck face?

47:05.839 --> 47:06.840
Stop.

47:08.609 --> 47:10.043
Stop! Stop the boat!

47:10.143 --> 47:11.554
Why? What's wrong?

47:12.579 --> 47:14.456
He's gone. He's gone!

47:17.885 --> 47:21.321
Something attacked him.
I think a giant alligator or something!

47:21.421 --> 47:23.724
Yeah, yeah, he's probably joking around.

47:23.824 --> 47:25.667
- I'll circle back and pick him up.
- I'm sorry.

47:41.208 --> 47:42.346
I'm allergic to water.

47:52.386 --> 47:53.888
He'll be okay, all right?

47:56.823 --> 47:57.927
I don't know.

48:02.362 --> 48:03.534
What the...

48:05.198 --> 48:06.677
Very funny, Andrew!

48:07.301 --> 48:09.247
That was a $200 rope.

48:09.803 --> 48:11.805
Maybe we should get back to the beach.

48:12.172 --> 48:14.675
I can't leave Andrew
in the middle of the lake,

48:14.775 --> 48:16.311
joke or no joke.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.596
Not again. Cut it out.

48:35.696 --> 48:38.232
That's not funny.
We've seen this before.

48:38.332 --> 48:39.538
Andrew?

48:53.347 --> 48:55.918
I did not give them permission
to get out of the water!

49:12.265 --> 49:13.869
Oh, my God, they're gone!

49:14.034 --> 49:15.206
Melissa!

49:15.702 --> 49:18.205
Oh, my God! Help me!

49:19.272 --> 49:21.013
Go, go!

49:25.345 --> 49:27.757
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

49:29.850 --> 49:31.454
Go, go!

49:31.718 --> 49:34.221
- Help me!
- No, Heather, no!

49:34.421 --> 49:35.764
Melissa, help me!

49:40.961 --> 49:43.737
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What do we do? Tiffani!

49:43.897 --> 49:45.342
I don't think we can outrun them!

49:45.899 --> 49:47.567
- God!
- Wait! I have an idea!

49:47.667 --> 49:48.668
What?

49:50.103 --> 49:51.207
Help me!

49:52.706 --> 49:54.117
No!

49:58.278 --> 50:00.881
Need I tell you that you're going
just a tad over the speed limit?

50:00.981 --> 50:03.183
- Write me a ticket.
- Don't tempt me.

50:03.283 --> 50:05.024
Ferguson, you out there?

50:05.619 --> 50:06.859
Come in.

50:07.654 --> 50:09.463
Ferguson, come in.

50:10.190 --> 50:12.960
- Excuse me, bro. Official police business.
- Ferguson.

50:13.060 --> 50:15.195
- Just, just one minute. Thanks.
- Okay.

50:15.295 --> 50:17.775
This is Ferguson. Who's this?

50:19.466 --> 50:21.335
It's your mother, Ferguson.

50:21.435 --> 50:24.541
I need you to get out to the Clear
Lake Marina and get everybody out.

50:24.671 --> 50:26.173
The lake is officially closed.

50:26.273 --> 50:29.409
Blame it on red algae
or brain-eating amoebas.

50:29.509 --> 50:31.445
I don't really care.
Just don't let anybody

50:31.545 --> 50:33.752
hear you say the word "Crocodile."

50:34.014 --> 50:36.083
We don't need to start a panic.
Am I clear?

50:36.183 --> 50:37.560
Roger that, Sheriff.

50:37.717 --> 50:39.697
Ix-nay on the ocodile-cray.

50:45.258 --> 50:46.464
Where's my...

50:47.894 --> 50:49.032
Okay.

50:50.997 --> 50:53.238
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

50:54.668 --> 50:56.011
Get in the car.

50:57.237 --> 50:59.973
- Where's Amber?
- I tried to save her, but she didn't make it.

51:00.073 --> 51:01.245
What? Oh, my God!

51:09.216 --> 51:10.984
Wait. You can't come in this car.

51:11.084 --> 51:13.064
- Why?
- I don't like your bikini.

51:18.992 --> 51:20.300
That's it. We're leaving.

51:21.094 --> 51:24.268
God, can you believe it?
I left the keys on the beach.

51:25.365 --> 51:28.141
You mind going back and getting them,
big sister?

51:28.702 --> 51:29.874
What? Are you nuts?

51:34.908 --> 51:37.320
Come on, come on, get out of here!

51:37.978 --> 51:39.286
Why aren't they leaving?

51:39.646 --> 51:41.182
Go! Go away!

51:41.815 --> 51:43.954
Yeah, that'll work.
Just tell them to leave.

51:55.729 --> 51:57.097
I'm getting out of here!

51:57.197 --> 51:59.108
No! Cassie, no!

52:03.236 --> 52:04.579
No!

52:11.778 --> 52:12.916
She's not gonna make it.

52:13.046 --> 52:14.047
Better her than me.

52:14.214 --> 52:16.421
- We got to help her.
- I volunteer...

52:16.750 --> 52:18.787
- Her.
- Why her?

52:19.019 --> 52:20.862
It's not like she's gonna get in anyway.

52:22.022 --> 52:24.593
Do you try to be a bitch
or does it just come naturally?

52:24.824 --> 52:26.633
Our only hope is Tiff's car.

52:27.294 --> 52:29.274
Okay? We go on three!

52:30.030 --> 52:33.534
One, two, three!

52:38.905 --> 52:39.906
No!

52:41.508 --> 52:43.749
I got you! I got you.

52:44.211 --> 52:45.519
I got you.

52:53.320 --> 52:54.458
We got to distract them.

52:54.754 --> 52:56.665
- Who's got something we can use?
- Like what?

52:57.057 --> 52:59.867
I need a can of hair spray.
Something flammable.

53:02.662 --> 53:03.730
How about spray tanner?

53:03.830 --> 53:04.931
Somebody must have left it there.

53:05.031 --> 53:07.170
That'll work. Who's got a lighter?

53:10.203 --> 53:11.682
Guilty as charged.

53:14.241 --> 53:16.881
Help! Help!

53:17.544 --> 53:19.279
They're gonna... They're gonna...

53:19.379 --> 53:20.947
No, they're not. It's okay.

53:21.047 --> 53:23.721
When I say the word,
just be ready to run, okay?

53:24.017 --> 53:26.361
Wait a second, I'm in charge here.
I say the word.

53:26.486 --> 53:27.863
I'm listening!

53:28.521 --> 53:30.057
Hey! Over here!

53:30.423 --> 53:31.424
Now?

53:31.524 --> 53:34.664
Now! Now! Now!

53:35.662 --> 53:36.936
Oh, my God!

54:07.394 --> 54:09.262
I'm not getting a signal.

54:09.362 --> 54:11.137
We must be out of range.

54:33.987 --> 54:35.489
It's a snake skin.

54:38.591 --> 54:40.161
One of them is molting.

54:43.129 --> 54:44.335
It's too big for the males.

54:44.664 --> 54:45.972
It's come from the female.

54:46.333 --> 54:48.501
She may be ready to lay her eggs.

54:48.601 --> 54:50.877
- We know one thing for sure.
- Which is what?

54:51.504 --> 54:52.710
She's still growing.

54:53.606 --> 54:55.984
Yeah, like she wasn't
big enough already.

54:56.609 --> 54:57.883
Move out!

54:59.879 --> 55:01.248
I'm fine.

55:01.348 --> 55:03.726
Just fine. Thanks for asking.

55:11.925 --> 55:13.461
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

55:13.727 --> 55:18.131
People of the visitors' center,
I need you to leave the premises right away.

55:18.231 --> 55:20.533
There is absolutely no reason to panic.

55:20.633 --> 55:21.601
Sorry.

55:21.701 --> 55:24.238
There is no need to panic.
Everything will be okay.

55:27.874 --> 55:30.010
By order of the Aroostook
County sheriff,

55:30.110 --> 55:33.613
I need you to all remove your vehicles
and exit in a calm and orderly manner.

55:33.713 --> 55:34.981
There's no need for pushing and shoving.

55:35.081 --> 55:36.716
Get out of the way, nerd boy!

55:36.816 --> 55:38.090
Be polite, people!

55:38.785 --> 55:41.925
This is a major emergency! Run!
Your life may depend on it!

55:47.060 --> 55:48.300
Stop. Stop!

55:49.562 --> 55:50.836
What is it?

56:00.473 --> 56:01.645
Sheriff...

56:03.843 --> 56:05.378
What the hell is it?

56:05.478 --> 56:07.185
It's crocodile prints.

56:08.548 --> 56:11.085
That tracker of yours
showing anything around here?

56:12.051 --> 56:15.157
No, no, no. It's still not working.
I left it in the truck.

56:58.731 --> 57:01.075
That's weird.
Where the hell did that thing go?

57:10.343 --> 57:11.378
Do something!

57:11.478 --> 57:12.752
Working on it!

57:20.753 --> 57:21.959
Oh, my God!

57:23.957 --> 57:25.197
What's that?

57:46.980 --> 57:48.186
Where you going?

57:49.148 --> 57:50.149
Damn!

57:54.187 --> 57:55.222
Sheriff!

57:56.789 --> 57:57.790
Sheriff!

57:58.191 --> 58:00.059
Sheriff, stop! What are you doing?

58:00.159 --> 58:01.528
I'm going after the snake!

58:01.628 --> 58:02.829
Hell, no.

58:02.929 --> 58:05.165
I'm not about to become
part of the food chain.

58:05.265 --> 58:06.533
I'm going back to the truck
to find my daughter.

58:06.633 --> 58:07.737
What?

58:14.340 --> 58:15.580
Come on.

58:16.809 --> 58:17.944
Come on, this way.

58:18.044 --> 58:20.524
I'm coming. I'm coming.
I got a bum knee.

58:27.921 --> 58:29.457
Sheriff, this is Ferguson.

58:30.990 --> 58:32.264
Sheriff, you copy?

58:32.458 --> 58:34.062
Yeah, I hear you, Ferguson. Go.

58:34.727 --> 58:35.899
This is Ferguson.

58:36.796 --> 58:39.106
I know, Ferguson. You just radio-ed me.

58:39.465 --> 58:42.936
Yeah, I just wanted you to know
that the visitors' center is secure

58:43.036 --> 58:44.709
and I've locked all the perimeter gates.

58:45.004 --> 58:46.176
Roger that.

58:47.340 --> 58:50.477
By any chance you come across
a group of sorority girls out there?

58:50.577 --> 58:52.212
Negative, Sheriff.
Just a bunch of families.

58:52.312 --> 58:53.382
Why?

58:53.580 --> 58:55.116
Did somebody else go missing?

58:55.615 --> 58:58.425
I'm with Tull. Meet me on the fire road.
We got another problem.

58:58.952 --> 59:01.432
Does it involve a C-R-O-C?

59:01.821 --> 59:03.061
Now, Ferguson!

59:03.256 --> 59:04.496
Roger that.

59:05.124 --> 59:06.296
Oh, my God.

59:08.761 --> 59:10.502
Damn it! Still no answer.

59:11.764 --> 59:13.867
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.571
No, me neither.

59:15.935 --> 59:18.037
I mean, it... It had to be an anaconda.

59:18.137 --> 59:21.641
The green anaconda, that's the largest
species in recorded history.

59:22.942 --> 59:27.015
That thing wasn't just large, Tull.
It was, it was ginormous.

59:27.146 --> 59:29.415
I know. I saw it. I can't explain it.

59:29.515 --> 59:31.284
I mean, I've heard stories
of these snakes

59:31.384 --> 59:34.365
getting to be 50 or more feet long,
eating cattle and people.

59:34.520 --> 59:38.124
But this is deep down in the jungles,
and they're just legends.

59:38.224 --> 59:39.362
Maybe not.

59:39.659 --> 59:43.830
Well, even if it's not a story,
they're indigenous to the Amazon.

59:43.930 --> 59:45.031
What the hell are they doing here?

59:45.131 --> 59:47.166
It had to have come from somewhere.

59:47.266 --> 59:49.135
It had to be a person
who brought it here.

59:49.235 --> 59:51.010
Great minds think alike.

59:51.237 --> 59:52.580
How did it get so big?

59:52.805 --> 59:55.149
I don't know. That's the least
of my worries at this point.

59:55.508 --> 59:56.509
You need more?

59:56.609 --> 59:58.578
My daughter is still out there.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.919
And any of these snakes
could be out there with her.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.922
And here I thought the crocs were bad.

01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:12.832
We can't just stay here.

01:00:13.159 --> 01:00:15.562
Maybe we can. I mean,
someone will figure out we're missing

01:00:15.662 --> 01:00:17.964
and send someone to find us. Right?

01:00:18.064 --> 01:00:19.065
That could take days.

01:00:19.165 --> 01:00:20.466
We'll starve to death.

01:00:20.566 --> 01:00:23.336
Trust me, some of you girls
could stand to lose a little weight.

01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:25.438
Oh, my God. Do I have to do everything?

01:00:25.538 --> 01:00:26.983
Switch with me.

01:00:28.141 --> 01:00:29.381
Okay.

01:00:36.082 --> 01:00:37.356
What are you doing?

01:00:38.117 --> 01:00:39.858
You were serious about stealing cars?

01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:47.366
All better. Let's go.

01:00:47.593 --> 01:00:49.095
How'd you learn to do that?

01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:51.238
When my dad wouldn't lend me his car.

01:00:51.597 --> 01:00:54.168
And that is why being a DG
is not in your future.

01:00:54.701 --> 01:00:56.169
How will my life go on?

01:00:56.269 --> 01:00:57.509
Drive!

01:01:06.779 --> 01:01:08.816
- I don't know...
- Where are we going?

01:01:09.849 --> 01:01:11.351
Oh, my God, watch out for that tree!

01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:14.432
My goodness! My goodness!

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:17.590
Damn it!

01:01:19.492 --> 01:01:21.369
Back up. There has to be another way.

01:01:22.729 --> 01:01:24.072
Come on!

01:01:24.697 --> 01:01:27.507
What are you waiting for, Tiff?
Just drive!

01:01:32.238 --> 01:01:33.239
Oh, my God!

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:42.422
Everybody out! Now!

01:01:46.385 --> 01:01:48.729
- Get out! Get out!
- I can't go out there!

01:01:48.888 --> 01:01:49.989
I can't!

01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:51.932
Wait! Where's Jennifer?

01:01:53.059 --> 01:01:54.129
Oh, my God.

01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:56.696
- She's still inside!
- What?

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:59.333
We have to get her out! Oh, my God.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:03.269
Hey, get off of there! Get off!

01:02:03.369 --> 01:02:06.748
- Yeah, that's smart! Piss off the giant snake!
- Somebody help me!

01:02:07.373 --> 01:02:10.445
Somebody help me! Someone!

01:02:25.525 --> 01:02:26.833
I'm so sorry.

01:02:27.927 --> 01:02:31.374
Hey, you did everything
somebody like you was willing to do.

01:02:32.231 --> 01:02:34.177
What am I going to tell my dad?

01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:37.578
He just bought me that car!

01:02:41.741 --> 01:02:45.478
If something happens
and I don't make it, do me a favor.

01:02:45.578 --> 01:02:47.023
Kick her ass.

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.758
First on my bucket list.

01:03:04.497 --> 01:03:06.943
- What is it?
- There's something out there.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:09.744
It's not showing up on here.

01:03:09.902 --> 01:03:12.075
Maybe the transmission
got damaged somehow.

01:03:12.338 --> 01:03:14.079
Or maybe it's something else.

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.951
Don't shoot it. It's a federal offense.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.615
What's it doing?

01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:23.955
Hunting.

01:03:24.116 --> 01:03:25.527
Hunting what?

01:03:25.952 --> 01:03:26.953
Us.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.258
The hell with this!

01:04:12.632 --> 01:04:13.736
He's dead.

01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:19.777
Let's get moving.
She could lay her eggs any time.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.176
We can't just leave him here like that.

01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.717
We can't take him with us.
He'll just slow us down.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.693
He knew what he was signing up for.
He have a family?

01:04:31.517 --> 01:04:32.689
A sister.

01:04:33.386 --> 01:04:35.764
Send flowers. Let's go.

01:04:40.993 --> 01:04:43.769
You do realize she's a sociopath, right?

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:45.866
It had crossed my mind.

01:05:10.122 --> 01:05:11.457
Any new leads on the sorority girls?

01:05:11.557 --> 01:05:13.434
- Space, Ferguson.
- No, sir... Sorry.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.337
You guys are covered in blood.

01:05:16.028 --> 01:05:20.099
There are only really two
usable beaches along the shoreline.

01:05:20.199 --> 01:05:22.501
Everything else is just too rocky,
too many trees.

01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:24.080
There's one along this path

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:26.706
and another one round back
all the way over to the other side.

01:05:26.806 --> 01:05:29.675
That one's more popular
with the local teenagers.

01:05:29.775 --> 01:05:32.051
If you, if you get my meaning.

01:05:32.545 --> 01:05:34.456
- Show me.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:36.253
Okay.

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:49.335
Oh, my God.

01:05:54.633 --> 01:05:55.935
Beth!

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.912
What the hell happened here?

01:05:59.271 --> 01:06:00.545
Bethany!

01:06:01.907 --> 01:06:04.285
- I'm gonna go check the lake.
- What...

01:06:08.347 --> 01:06:09.348
I'm just gonna...

01:06:09.782 --> 01:06:12.018
- Ferguson! Let's go!
- Just gotta get my gun.

01:06:12.118 --> 01:06:13.188
Okay.

01:06:15.988 --> 01:06:17.865
What's an abandoned boat doing here?

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:20.660
Ferguson, go check the boat out, okay?

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.001
We're gonna check the shoreline.
Let's go.

01:06:48.687 --> 01:06:50.064
What the...

01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:06.539
I need you to focus.
Okay, I'm gonna ask you again.

01:07:06.639 --> 01:07:08.174
What happened on the boat?

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.576
Who else was on the boat with you?
Think.

01:07:10.676 --> 01:07:12.747
I don't know.

01:07:13.579 --> 01:07:18.085
Andrew was wakeboarding and...

01:07:19.085 --> 01:07:21.821
Okay, but who else was there, all right?
I'm looking for someone. Okay?

01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:26.292
I'm looking for a girl, 5'4", blond hair,
blue eyes, named Bethany.

01:07:26.392 --> 01:07:27.598
Bethany Tull.

01:07:28.027 --> 01:07:29.929
- Her name is Bethany!
- Okay, relax, Tully, okay?

01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:32.431
I don't remember any other girls
on the beach!

01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:35.603
Are you here for rush week?
Are you part of the sorority?

01:07:35.835 --> 01:07:37.075
I'm looking for my daughter, damn it!

01:07:37.336 --> 01:07:39.577
- Tully, come here!
- I told you I don't remember!

01:07:39.939 --> 01:07:41.077
Take it easy, Tully.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.275
Can't you see
that the girl is hysterical?

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:45.444
You're not gonna get anything from her,
not now.

01:07:45.544 --> 01:07:47.546
- I know. I just... I'm sorry. I lost it.
- It's all right.

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:48.852
I'm sorry.

01:07:49.748 --> 01:07:51.951
Everything will be okay. I promise.
I promise. It'll all be okay.

01:07:52.051 --> 01:07:53.052
It's okay.

01:07:53.385 --> 01:07:54.754
Get her to the hospital, would you?
Okay?

01:07:54.854 --> 01:07:56.299
Okay. Hey.

01:07:58.124 --> 01:08:00.968
Hey. Now let's go find
your daughter, okay?

01:08:02.461 --> 01:08:03.735
Come on.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.804
I got something.

01:08:09.869 --> 01:08:11.246
Signal's pretty weak.

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:13.411
She's far.

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:19.147
How big is this lake?

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:23.290
Well, this is about as wide as she gets.

01:08:23.983 --> 01:08:27.328
Goes down that way another click or so
before it hits the Clear Lake Dam.

01:08:28.487 --> 01:08:29.727
How do we get there?

01:08:31.557 --> 01:08:32.865
Well, let's see.

01:08:33.091 --> 01:08:35.572
Well, we could take the roads
or go back over land.

01:08:40.232 --> 01:08:42.542
There's a boat. That'll do.

01:08:44.403 --> 01:08:47.179
I believe that's a tad too small, miss.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.786
I'm sure you've heard that
more than once in your life.

01:08:52.144 --> 01:08:54.380
I don't think that belongs to us,
Ms. Murdoch.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:57.515
I don't care what you think.
Now are you coming?

01:08:57.616 --> 01:08:59.788
Or are you giving me my money back?

01:09:28.013 --> 01:09:29.356
What the hell?

01:09:39.558 --> 01:09:41.697
Something crushed it like a tin can.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.399
There's no way a crocodile
could do this.

01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:46.776
You and I both know it wasn't a croc.

01:09:56.075 --> 01:09:57.486
Where are you going?

01:09:58.143 --> 01:10:00.623
I'm gonna find my daughter
before that snake does.

01:10:01.213 --> 01:10:03.159
Just another day at the office.

01:10:07.753 --> 01:10:10.789
Lower your throttle, you goon.
You're going too fast.

01:10:10.889 --> 01:10:12.698
Don't listen to him. Speed up!

01:10:15.094 --> 01:10:16.929
That's a hell of a lot of wake.

01:10:17.029 --> 01:10:18.064
So?

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:21.506
So, a big wake, lots of splashing,

01:10:21.867 --> 01:10:23.904
tends to attract crocs.

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:27.642
I got bigger things to worry about
than crocodiles, Mr. Bickerman.

01:10:28.073 --> 01:10:30.314
Yeah. That's what you think.

01:10:44.423 --> 01:10:45.691
What the hell was that?

01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:46.959
We hit something.

01:10:47.059 --> 01:10:48.561
Or something hit us.

01:10:50.062 --> 01:10:52.440
I don't have time for this. Move!

01:10:52.865 --> 01:10:54.469
Can you even drive a boat, lady?

01:10:56.602 --> 01:10:59.879
What are you doing? We have to go back.
We have to go back.

01:11:00.072 --> 01:11:01.312
Hey!

01:11:02.207 --> 01:11:03.277
Hey!

01:11:03.442 --> 01:11:05.319
Murdoch, you bitch!

01:11:06.612 --> 01:11:08.714
- Help!
- Hey! Turn the boat around.

01:11:08.814 --> 01:11:10.049
We got to go back and get him!

01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:11.457
We're not going back.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:14.990
You want to save him?
Feel free to go for a swim.

01:11:36.809 --> 01:11:39.483
That's it. I've had it.
I'm taking a break.

01:11:40.012 --> 01:11:41.347
We should just keep moving.

01:11:41.447 --> 01:11:42.983
I don't care what you do.

01:11:43.182 --> 01:11:44.923
I need a minute to catch my breath.

01:11:45.317 --> 01:11:47.524
No, no, she's right.
We should just stop.

01:11:47.853 --> 01:11:50.522
Let's just stand here
so the giant snake can catch us.

01:11:50.622 --> 01:11:51.790
I don't think it followed us.

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:54.370
What we need to do
is find our way back to the main road.

01:11:54.693 --> 01:11:56.673
Get your weasel ass up and keep moving.

01:11:56.829 --> 01:12:00.140
The only way you're getting into
this sorority is over my dead body.

01:12:00.532 --> 01:12:01.704
Dare to dream.

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.003
All right, girls. Two minutes.

01:12:04.103 --> 01:12:06.005
And then we try to find the main road.

01:12:06.105 --> 01:12:07.846
Just keep an eye out.

01:12:08.307 --> 01:12:10.753
Crocodiles, snakes,

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:12.953
who knows what else
could be out here with us?

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:16.458
Lions and tigers and bears, oh my.

01:12:16.815 --> 01:12:20.285
Brings me back to my wonderful,
yet nightmarish, childhood.

01:12:22.221 --> 01:12:23.598
Anybody else hear that?

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:25.424
Yes.

01:12:25.858 --> 01:12:27.235
Oh, my God, something's out there.

01:12:30.829 --> 01:12:33.605
Anyone want to bet it's not a cute,
little, scary-ass munchkin?

01:12:33.899 --> 01:12:35.868
Maybe it's a search party.

01:12:35.968 --> 01:12:37.572
Maybe they're looking for me.

01:12:38.804 --> 01:12:40.408
Whatever it is, it's coming this way.

01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:43.119
If it is a search party,
they're not leaving without me.

01:12:57.723 --> 01:13:00.135
I didn't think there were any crocodiles
in Clear Lake!

01:13:00.492 --> 01:13:02.403
Well, there's your search party.

01:13:02.728 --> 01:13:05.197
That's not funny! What do I do?

01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:07.299
Just don't move.

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:11.675
Don't move.

01:13:16.775 --> 01:13:19.153
No! Nobody messes with a DG sister!

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:25.090
Oh, my God!

01:13:38.163 --> 01:13:39.574
What the hell?

01:13:45.804 --> 01:13:47.673
- Run!
- Oh, my God!

01:13:47.773 --> 01:13:49.480
- Oh, my God, run!
- Beth!

01:13:50.409 --> 01:13:52.082
Dad! Dad!

01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:55.289
Oh, my God. I thought I lost you.

01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:57.326
I knew you'd come for me.

01:13:57.749 --> 01:13:58.887
Of course.

01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:03.028
I'm gonna go home and reenact that
to my dad and evil stepmom.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.992
Listen, this is real sweet and all,
but we'd better get moving.

01:14:07.092 --> 01:14:08.093
I can't argue with that.

01:14:08.327 --> 01:14:10.398
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- Okay.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.802
All right, Beach.

01:14:16.902 --> 01:14:19.338
You've had that look on your face
since we got off the boat.

01:14:19.438 --> 01:14:20.539
What is it?

01:14:20.639 --> 01:14:22.508
Nothing you need to worry about.

01:14:22.608 --> 01:14:25.277
I'm putting my mission
and my life in your hands.

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:28.881
If you have a problem,
then hell yes, I need to worry.

01:14:29.114 --> 01:14:32.951
I didn't like him any more than you did,
but we could've pulled him out of the water.

01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:36.089
No one around here is gonna miss
Jim Bickerman, believe me.

01:14:36.455 --> 01:14:38.264
Besides, he's probably fine.

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:40.734
There wasn't that much left of him.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:42.967
He was a loose end.

01:14:43.662 --> 01:14:46.199
He was right. You are a sociopath.

01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:49.071
I'm not a sociopath, Mr. Beach.

01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:52.571
I'm a person trying to protect
her father's legacy.

01:14:52.671 --> 01:14:55.641
He spent most of his life
perfecting the Blood Orchid serum

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.914
and I intend to finish what he started.

01:14:58.210 --> 01:14:59.645
Make no mistakes.

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:03.921
I will gladly sacrifice anyone
or anything that gets in my way.

01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:05.284
Including you.

01:15:07.286 --> 01:15:08.560
Nice to know where I stand.

01:15:09.121 --> 01:15:11.692
Just keep doing your job
and you'll be fine.

01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:26.442
This was such a gigantic mistake.

01:15:26.872 --> 01:15:29.011
I should have pledged Omega Kappa.

01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:31.543
How much further is it?

01:15:31.643 --> 01:15:33.912
This is not my neck
of the woods, I am lost.

01:15:34.012 --> 01:15:36.248
Relax, Tully, I know where we're going.

01:15:36.348 --> 01:15:37.520
All right.

01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:43.428
Sheriff, this is Ferguson. You copy?

01:15:44.656 --> 01:15:45.828
Roger that.

01:15:46.558 --> 01:15:48.299
Sheriff, can you hear me?

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.330
I copy, Ferguson.

01:15:50.862 --> 01:15:52.034
Is that you?

01:15:54.399 --> 01:15:55.742
I give up. I give up.

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:02.912
According to this signal,
she's right here somewhere.

01:16:03.775 --> 01:16:06.654
We've been flushing them out
toward the choke point.

01:16:07.112 --> 01:16:09.285
There's no way out.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:12.287
I'm telling you.

01:16:13.085 --> 01:16:15.326
She's right here.

01:16:15.621 --> 01:16:17.089
What do you mean, right here?

01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:20.592
The only thing I'm seeing out here
is you, me and Mr. Happy.

01:16:20.692 --> 01:16:24.139
I'm telling you, she's right here.

01:16:27.132 --> 01:16:28.372
Where is it?

01:16:49.287 --> 01:16:51.233
- That's not her.
- What do you mean, that's not her?

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:52.357
That's the male.

01:16:52.457 --> 01:16:53.527
Then where the hell is she?

01:16:57.295 --> 01:16:58.365
Don't shoot it!

01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:02.437
Damn!

01:17:07.973 --> 01:17:09.384
You'll kill him if you shoot my snake!

01:17:14.312 --> 01:17:15.347
What are you doing?

01:17:15.747 --> 01:17:17.749
I told you I wasn't
gonna let you kill it,

01:17:17.849 --> 01:17:20.452
which is what I'll do to you
if you get in my way.

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:21.553
Over there.

01:17:24.856 --> 01:17:26.927
Don't you ever do that again.

01:17:27.526 --> 01:17:28.766
Now, come on!

01:17:41.606 --> 01:17:42.908
What the hell was that?

01:17:43.008 --> 01:17:45.177
I don't know, but it's big. Let's move.

01:17:45.277 --> 01:17:46.381
Come on.

01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:52.250
Wait a second!

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:54.352
We need the tracking device
and the case, you idiot!

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:56.323
And I'll take my gun back.

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:09.901
This is Ferguson, over.

01:18:10.001 --> 01:18:12.404
Lot of movement down here.
Crocs and snakes, over.

01:18:12.504 --> 01:18:14.006
Ferguson, where the hell are you?

01:18:14.272 --> 01:18:17.048
I'm in a back path somewhere
trying to find one of the crocs.

01:18:18.076 --> 01:18:20.249
And I think I can hear something.

01:18:23.048 --> 01:18:24.493
Can you hear this, Ferguson?

01:18:24.883 --> 01:18:27.386
You're hearing us. You're hearing us!

01:18:27.986 --> 01:18:29.522
- Turn around!
- What?

01:18:29.988 --> 01:18:31.194
Got it.

01:18:35.761 --> 01:18:37.138
No grip on my shoes.

01:18:40.565 --> 01:18:41.873
Come on.

01:18:45.237 --> 01:18:46.511
Okay, got it.

01:18:46.772 --> 01:18:48.149
- All right?
- Okay.

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:57.221
Nobody move!

01:18:59.484 --> 01:19:01.086
Ready to fill your freezer?

01:19:01.186 --> 01:19:02.320
You got a full clip?

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.189
Never leave home without it.

01:19:04.289 --> 01:19:07.998
Hey, how dare you point
your guns at my snake?

01:19:08.293 --> 01:19:10.295
I'm the sheriff, lady.
Who the hell are you?

01:19:10.529 --> 01:19:13.567
I don't care who you are.
You're not killing my snake!

01:19:13.899 --> 01:19:16.812
You see, I'm the one who says
who kills who and what around here.

01:19:17.135 --> 01:19:18.512
Right now, you're on my list.

01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.272
This is a controlled animal reserve.

01:19:20.372 --> 01:19:22.374
Drop your gun
and tell your henchmen to stand down.

01:19:22.674 --> 01:19:24.244
Let me just educate you a little bit.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:29.921
Those snakes are the property
of the Wexel Corporation.

01:19:30.549 --> 01:19:35.157
You kill them and I am gonna sue
the town of Lake Placid into bankruptcy.

01:19:35.821 --> 01:19:39.564
It's gonna be a little tricky, don't you think,
to attract tourists to a ghost town?

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:42.972
Now, I'm gonna put him down
for a little nap.

01:19:44.329 --> 01:19:47.333
My extraction team is gonna
bring them back to the lab.

01:19:47.732 --> 01:19:49.167
And you and your little
college field trip

01:19:49.267 --> 01:19:51.304
can do whatever you want
with your crocodiles.

01:19:51.736 --> 01:19:52.737
Beach.

01:19:55.006 --> 01:19:58.681
Extraction Team, this is Black Lake recovery.
Get ready for extraction.

01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:00.514
Read you loud and clear. We're here.

01:20:00.679 --> 01:20:03.751
Then again, Beach, kill the damn crocs.

01:20:03.982 --> 01:20:05.393
Don't let them kill the male.

01:20:06.985 --> 01:20:08.123
What the hell was that?

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:11.401
After everything I've seen today,
nothing would surprise me.

01:20:13.191 --> 01:20:14.363
Hello?

01:20:15.327 --> 01:20:16.567
Except that.

01:20:16.695 --> 01:20:17.833
She's here!

01:20:18.096 --> 01:20:20.576
That is one big-ass snake.

01:20:25.136 --> 01:20:26.706
That's my girl!

01:20:27.606 --> 01:20:30.883
On my coordinates, gentlemen,
prepare for snake extraction.

01:20:31.843 --> 01:20:33.379
Roger that. We have eyes on you.

01:20:36.648 --> 01:20:38.389
That's okay, baby.

01:20:38.817 --> 01:20:41.058
You will all be home soon.

01:20:53.732 --> 01:20:56.067
Looks like your extraction team
just got extracted.

01:20:56.167 --> 01:20:57.569
- Ferguson!
- Yes, sir.

01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:59.171
Get my daughter
and her friends to safety.

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:00.405
I'm not leaving you here.

01:21:00.505 --> 01:21:01.540
I'll be fine.

01:21:02.173 --> 01:21:04.342
- Just go. Go!
- Yeah, okay. Come on, let's go.

01:21:04.442 --> 01:21:05.977
And if things go south,
get 'em the hell out of here.

01:21:06.077 --> 01:21:07.385
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:21:12.217 --> 01:21:13.753
Just kill the damn croc!

01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:28.476
- Kill it.
- Oh, my God!

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.755
No! Don't kill my baby!

01:21:50.855 --> 01:21:52.892
You really are a psycho bitch!

01:21:54.793 --> 01:21:55.999
Damn it!

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.705
Girls, don't watch, don't watch.
Don't watch!

01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:06.608
Oh, my God.

01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:24.798
Bye, bye, baby!

01:22:26.391 --> 01:22:28.769
No!

01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:37.602
Oh, my God.

01:22:37.702 --> 01:22:40.842
This is really starting
to get disgusting.

01:22:41.006 --> 01:22:42.073
God!

01:22:42.173 --> 01:22:43.447
God!

01:22:45.777 --> 01:22:47.484
I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:22:48.079 --> 01:22:49.114
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:50.750
God, that's disgusting.

01:23:44.302 --> 01:23:47.647
When my lawyers are through with you,
you'll wish you never met me.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.742
I already do. Trust me.

01:23:50.842 --> 01:23:54.045
When she's done with you,
you and I have some business to discuss.

01:23:54.145 --> 01:23:56.284
Yeah, good luck keeping your badge.

01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:02.061
Good luck being
someone's bitch behind bars.

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:06.791
Ferguson, cuff her.

01:24:06.891 --> 01:24:08.165
Yeah.

01:24:11.029 --> 01:24:13.100
I left 'em at home. Sorry.

01:24:15.834 --> 01:24:17.643
- Here. There you go.
- Sorry.

01:24:18.269 --> 01:24:19.680
- Ferguson?
- Yeah?

01:24:21.039 --> 01:24:22.143
Good job.

01:24:25.176 --> 01:24:26.746
Space, Ferguson.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.125
Tull.

01:24:31.616 --> 01:24:35.223
This is why your tracking software
was on the fritz.

01:24:36.254 --> 01:24:37.422
Back in the day,

01:24:37.522 --> 01:24:40.935
we used those to track tagged animals
and jam the Feds.

01:24:41.226 --> 01:24:42.427
No kidding?

01:24:42.527 --> 01:24:43.528
Far out.

01:24:44.062 --> 01:24:47.874
This is great. I mean, I can get
all the crocs back in the reserve now.

01:24:48.967 --> 01:24:50.844
Finally, some good news, huh?

01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:52.837
Dad!

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:57.509
Babe.

01:24:59.844 --> 01:25:03.986
So, Dad, I know I said I would join
Deltas in honor of Mom,

01:25:04.883 --> 01:25:06.863
but do you think it would be
okay if I didn't?

01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:11.357
I don't think that she would mind a bit.

01:25:12.423 --> 01:25:16.633
Besides, you honor her every day
by being so awesome.

01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:21.143
- I love you so much.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.004
I'm so glad you're safe.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:26.675
Hey, guess what?

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:29.146
Get in the truck!

01:25:43.855 --> 01:25:45.129
Later, gator.

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:48.066
It's not a gator. It's a crocodile.

01:25:48.593 --> 01:25:49.901
Whatever.
