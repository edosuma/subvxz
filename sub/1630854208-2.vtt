<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:03.904 --> 00:05.506
<i>You have been through so much--</i>

00:05.606 --> 00:06.740
<i>losing your friend,</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:08.509
<i>learning about your mother's past</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:10.178
<i>and what she's doing now.</i>

00:10.278 --> 00:11.179
Your world

00:11.279 --> 00:12.580
turned upside down.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.382
<i>I keep getting</i>

00:14.482 --> 00:16.384
<i>these random feelings of dread.</i>

00:16.484 --> 00:19.153
Like something horrible
is going to happen.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.456
I would never let anything
happen to you.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.625
Mom, it's not me
that I'm worried about.

00:24.725 --> 00:25.993
It's you.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.196
There's something
going on that you both

00:28.296 --> 00:30.298
need to know about.
Mom!

00:31.232 --> 00:32.833
Are you okay?
No.

00:32.933 --> 00:33.867
<i>No, I'm-I'm not.</i>

00:33.967 --> 00:36.003
<i>Some men, they took my mom.</i>

00:36.104 --> 00:38.372
You guys have a photo we can use
to help find your mom?

00:41.742 --> 00:43.244
Okay.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.879
Rob! Oh, thank God!
Oh!

00:45.979 --> 00:47.415
I can't believe I let this
happen in front of my family.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.417
You know, I recently went
through something

00:49.517 --> 00:51.085
I didn't think
I'd make it back from.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.454
Point is,
I had to stay positive.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.888
<i>Especially in the darkest moments.</i>

00:54.988 --> 00:56.790
<i>And you know
who helped me do that? Your mom.</i>

00:56.890 --> 00:59.627
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.564
<i>Engine 1764 in need</i>

01:03.664 --> 01:05.199

01:05.299 --> 01:08.236

01:08.336 --> 01:09.670

Jeff!

01:12.005 --> 01:13.474
Jeff!

01:14.175 --> 01:15.943
Where'd you go?!

01:19.513 --> 01:20.614
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

01:20.714 --> 01:22.450
I'm trapped! No way out!

01:22.550 --> 01:25.085
I'm on A-side of the building!
East corner!

01:25.186 --> 01:27.855
All exits are blocked!
I need immediate assistance!

01:27.955 --> 01:29.290
Help! Help!

01:29.390 --> 01:31.825

Clay!

01:35.496 --> 01:37.565
I'm here. I got you, buddy.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.969
Sorry, buddy.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.036
I'm sorry.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.442
Where the hell
were you?!

01:49.310 --> 01:50.244
You son of a bitch!

01:50.344 --> 01:51.345
Hey! Hey!

01:58.352 --> 01:59.320
That's enough!

I didn't sleep
too well.

03:00.948 --> 03:01.982
Where's Dee?

03:02.082 --> 03:03.083
She got up early.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.818
Didn't want to wake you.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.289
Don't worry, Mama.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.425
She's gonna be okay.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.694
Just...

03:13.794 --> 03:16.497
She's been making such
good progress with her PTSD.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.998
And then this?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.539
I'm sorry, Auntie.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.209
Haven't even asked you
how you're doing.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.379
I'm okay.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.714
Sleep's elusive. I still...

03:33.814 --> 03:36.784
occasionally jump
at my own shadow, but...

03:36.884 --> 03:37.985
working through it.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.520
Well, be careful.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.922
Trauma's tricky.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.193
It can take a few days
before it kicks in.

03:54.868 --> 03:55.969
I got to get to work.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.371
What's the case?

03:57.471 --> 03:58.972
Um, potential
missing person.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.876
Is it dangerous? Are you
gonna be out again all night?

04:03.777 --> 04:05.546
Auntie, am I being
interrogated?

04:05.646 --> 04:06.880
Considering what
we've all just gone through,

04:06.980 --> 04:08.282
I think I have a right to know.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.551
Trust me, you don't want
to know everything.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.019
In fact, I do.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.854
You know what
the worst part about

04:13.954 --> 04:16.056
watching you get abducted was?

04:16.156 --> 04:18.726
There wasn't a damn thing
I could do about it.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.429
Never felt so...

04:21.529 --> 04:23.230
powerless, so...

04:23.331 --> 04:24.698
helpless.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.534
Yeah, I get it.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.068
No, you don't.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.770
You've dealt with

04:29.870 --> 04:32.172
this kind of situation
for the last 20 years.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.441
You're-you're educated,

04:33.541 --> 04:35.275
you're... trained.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.511
You're a professional.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.413
We are just...

04:39.513 --> 04:41.014
tourists.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.216
If nothing else,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.185
we deserve a heads-up.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.426
Tell you what--

04:52.526 --> 04:55.429
I'll assess the case.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.399
And if it seems dangerous,

04:58.499 --> 05:00.067
then I'll let you know.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.039
Okay.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.522
So what makes you think
your father is missing?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.457
I haven't heard from him
in three days,

05:23.557 --> 05:25.459
which is
just... weird.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.328
No texts, no phone calls. Nothing.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.764
Your mom either?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.033
No, but that's not unusual.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.101
They're divorced.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.268
Mm.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.370
And you live with her?

05:36.470 --> 05:37.371
Most days.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.772
My dad's a firefighter,

05:38.872 --> 05:41.174
so his schedule's super crazy.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.077
Well, isn't it possible
he just got busy?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.279
That's what I thought at first.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.550
But... (sighs) yesterday,
he missed my soccer playoffs.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.152
And he's never missed
a game. Ever.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.422
I'm telling you something
is wrong. I can feel it.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.189
Did you inform the police?

05:56.289 --> 05:57.190
I tried, but...

05:57.290 --> 05:58.592
they said since he's an adult,

05:58.692 --> 06:00.327
there's not a whole lot
they can do.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.396
That's why I came to you.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.831
Where is your mom?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.365
Why isn't
she here?

06:05.466 --> 06:06.834
She...

06:06.934 --> 06:09.002
thinks my dad's
on another bender.

06:09.803 --> 06:10.838
"Another"?

06:10.938 --> 06:12.339
He had a problem.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.307
He's been sober
for two years.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.710
Well, that's
not easy.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.280
Last time he drank,

06:20.380 --> 06:21.682
he was cooking

06:21.782 --> 06:22.983
and fell asleep.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.619
And when I came out,
the kitchen was on fire.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.755
And I made him promise me
right then

06:27.855 --> 06:29.423
that he'd never drink again.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.591
I stayed up
with him at night,

06:30.691 --> 06:33.326
through the shakes
and the sickness.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.863
And it wasn't pretty,
but he made it.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.765
He went to all
of his meetings,

06:37.865 --> 06:39.567
and he earned
his sobriety chip.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.068
He did the work.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.204
And he's never let me down since.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.441
But if you don't believe me...

06:47.541 --> 06:48.709
No.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.378
It's just that you remind me

06:51.479 --> 06:52.980
of someone I know.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.751
And I know how she'd feel
if she were in your situation.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.653
Does that mean you'll help me?

06:59.753 --> 07:02.055
Can't make any promises.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.992
But I'll look into it.

07:08.796 --> 07:09.763
How's the family?
They okay?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.932
Well, Dee's been avoiding me,

07:12.032 --> 07:14.835
and Aunt Vi has decided
she needs to be downloaded

07:14.935 --> 07:16.570
on the dangers of every case.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.407
I get it.
It's a lot for them to handle.

07:20.508 --> 07:24.712
Yeah, well, I can't promise
that, obviously, so...

07:24.812 --> 07:26.013
what do I do?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.180
Your best.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.448
It's all you can do.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.085
Your face.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.521
I don't even know
where to start.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.755
What, did you
start shaving

07:34.855 --> 07:36.256
and change your mind
halfway through?

07:36.356 --> 07:37.925
No.
Aw, I like it.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.392
It's like, uh,
surf and turf.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.294
Okay, I'm not even touching
that one.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.295
What do we have?

07:42.395 --> 07:43.430
This the client?

07:43.531 --> 07:44.765
Yeah.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.967
I can't track her father down though.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.570
His phone has been off-line.
I'm gonna try something else.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.005
They seem really close.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.241
Yeah, but sometimes
that bottle can get closer.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.510
Especially when you're
a firefighter.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.746
No, yeah. One minute, you're...

07:58.846 --> 08:01.148
a superhero,
your life is on the line,

08:01.248 --> 08:02.683
you're jacked up on adrenaline,

08:02.783 --> 08:04.351
and the next minute,
you're just...

08:04.451 --> 08:05.819
home, doing nothing.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.021
Yeah, managing those swings
has got to be brutal.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.958
What's worse is the care
firefighters get for both

08:11.058 --> 08:13.193
mental
and physical health is...

08:13.293 --> 08:14.862
severely lacking.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.933
I had a cousin who was
a firefighter in the Bronx.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.535
Family was supportive
as much

08:21.635 --> 08:25.138
as they could be,
but it all got so bad so fast.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.439
I'm sorry.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.876
Thanks.
All right.
I got something. Look.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.410
He's got a fitness
tracker account.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.079
If it's active,
it may tell us something.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.280
Just give me a second.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.548
Okay.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.049
Got a location. Check it out.

08:36.149 --> 08:36.950
Heart's
still beating.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.085
But zero steps

08:38.185 --> 08:39.419
in the last three hours.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.088
It's making me wonder
whether or not

08:41.188 --> 08:42.856
he started hitting
the bottle again and passed out.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.458
Only one way to find out.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.428
What are you gonna tell her
if, uh...

08:48.528 --> 08:50.463
if her father
fell off the wagon?

08:51.431 --> 08:54.067
Tell her the truth
as gently as I can give it.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.237
She deserves to know.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.182
Hello.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.517
What?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.452
You're not Jeff.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.654
What do you want?

09:13.754 --> 09:15.122
I just want to talk.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.958
Would've straightened up
a little more

09:18.058 --> 09:18.992
if I knew you were coming.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.127
On your wrist.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.062
Where'd you get that?

09:23.330 --> 09:24.464
Macy's.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.668
I didn't steal it, okay?

09:27.768 --> 09:29.469
I found it behind the...

09:30.237 --> 09:32.305
Next to the car over there.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.635
Mel, I found Jeff's car.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.636
Sam was right.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.472
Her father's in trouble.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.488
I know that face.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.456
Everything okay?

10:23.556 --> 10:25.425
Question of the day.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.828
Family stuff.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.130
If you need anything,
I'm here.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.599
I don't know
your aunt,

10:32.700 --> 10:33.867
but that kid
of yours,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.203
she's a fighter.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.474
I guess I owe you a talk, huh?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.144
Wasn't gonna push.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.783
Mel, what's up?

10:49.883 --> 10:52.052
We did a prelim search
into Jeff's financials.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.688
We came up empty. We're heading
to his fire station now.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.389
You got to figure,
whatever's going on with Jeff,

10:56.489 --> 10:57.858
someone there knows something
about it.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.292
Let me know what you find out.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.961
All right.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.364
Detective Dante.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.899
Got something?
Only one usable print

11:05.999 --> 11:07.701
that didn't belong to
the vehicle's owner.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.236
A woman named
Angela Barrett.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.403
She have a sheet?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.239
Domestic violence,
multiple assaults.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.440
But dismissed.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.942
Not exactly
a model citizen.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.244
Any idea who she is?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.412
No. But I'm gonna find out.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.787
Help you?
Yeah.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.289
Uh, we're looking
for Jeff Doyle.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.657
Join the club.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.525
He was scheduled to work today.
He hasn't shown.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.994
What do you two
want with him?

11:34.094 --> 11:36.496
We're from his,
uh, support group.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.565
A.A.?
Yeah.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.333
Glad to hear
he's sticking with it.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.701
Like clockwork.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.470
Except we haven't seen him
in a few days,

11:43.570 --> 11:45.138
and he's not returning
our calls.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.808
Well, if anyone knows anything,
it's these two guys here.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.476
Tall one and
his buddy there.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.478
Thick as thieves.
They're always together.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.113
Maybe they can help.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.381
Great.
Okay.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.249
Thank you.
You're welcome.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.326
Thanks.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.394
Sup, guys?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.197
Excuse us.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.631
Sup?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.267
Sup, bro?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.503
What's happening? Are you
lowering your voice?

12:16.603 --> 12:18.772
Oh, my God,
no. What?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.107
Haven't talked to Jeff
all weekend.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.842
Me either.
Not since the Friday shift.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.710
Any chance he's in
some sort of trouble?

12:23.811 --> 12:25.178
I doubt it.
He's a good dude.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.947
Been a straight arrow
ever since he stopped drinking.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.615
Anyone you can think of
that might, uh,

12:28.715 --> 12:30.150
be holding a grudge against him?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.990
That guy have beef with Jeff?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.959
Let's just say they're not BFFs.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.294
Unless your best friend tries
to bury an axe in your head.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.329
Look, um...

12:43.163 --> 12:44.331
We got to finish up here,
all right?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.565
Yeah. Thanks
for your help.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.000
Thank you.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.936
Got no idea where he is,
but it's par for the course.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.570
The guy's completely unreliable.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.172
How so?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.874
I don't know. Leaving the
station without telling anyone.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.142
Taking off in the middle
of a fire

12:55.242 --> 12:56.944
as the roof
almost collapses on my head.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.346
So I-I take it you're
not his number one fan.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.182
This place, you're only
as strong as your weakest link.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.217
And when you're out there in
the middle of a blaze, you can't

13:04.317 --> 13:05.752
afford to have any weak links.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.454
That why you two got into it?

13:07.554 --> 13:08.521
I did what I had to do.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.923
Well, what does that mean?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.691
Means I gave him
a nice two-piece to the jaw.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.526
Little side
of Pulaski?

13:13.626 --> 13:14.862
It's a fire axe.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.063
I wasn't gonna use it.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.630
I was just trying
to scare the prick.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.067
Apparently it worked.
Haven't seen him since.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.838
So they got into an altercation.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.874
Well,
when sharp objects are involved,

13:26.974 --> 13:28.876
it's a bit more
than an altercation.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.477
Guy claims he's
got an alibi.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.845
Was out of town
this weekend.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.546
I'll look into it,
make sure it's legit.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.348
Well, it'd be pretty stupid
for him to do something to Jeff

13:35.448 --> 13:37.617
right after their whole company
saw them get into it.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.419
Yeah. You get
anything from the car?

13:39.519 --> 13:40.587
Yeah, single print.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.389
Woman named Angela Barrett.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.857
See what you can find on her.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.392
Social media footprint,

13:45.492 --> 13:46.793
credit cards, all of it.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.029
I'm about to pay her a visit.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.667
Hey. Who the hell are you?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.504
Hey!

14:05.645 --> 14:07.447
I need an ambulance.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.649
225 Hollis Avenue. Hurry.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.285
Hang on. Hang
on, hang on.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.161
<i>I know I've been
secretive lately.</i>

14:21.261 --> 14:23.730
But there's something

15:12.679 --> 15:14.714
Okay, thanks
for the update.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.216
How's Angela doing?

15:16.316 --> 15:17.951
She's stable for now.
That was the hospital.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.886
You find anything
on her?

15:19.987 --> 15:21.621
Yeah, did a deep dive.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.523
I found a few tidbits
you might enjoy.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.226
So it turns out that Angela and
Jeff have been spending quite

15:26.326 --> 15:28.428
a bit of time together.
Love at first sight?

15:28.528 --> 15:29.862
Probably not.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.398
Angela's been waitressing

15:31.498 --> 15:33.566
at a restaurant
that just so happened

15:33.666 --> 15:35.502
to burn down last Friday.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.903
And per the arson report--

15:37.004 --> 15:38.905
Jeff's brigade
responded to the blaze.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.474
Exactly. Looking into
the restaurant, it turns out

15:41.574 --> 15:43.543
that every Friday an armored car

15:43.643 --> 15:45.845
shows up and picks up
the weekly earnings.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.081
Information
Angela could slide to him.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.483
Exactly! This particular fire...

15:50.583 --> 15:51.951
took place just an hour before

15:52.052 --> 15:53.486
the payroll was due
to be picked up.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.722
So Jeff starts the fire
and uses the cover

15:55.822 --> 15:57.557
of the blaze to steal the money.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.059
And the next day,
Jeff disappears.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.693
Two days later, Angela's shot.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.062
Well, sounds
like someone else put

16:02.162 --> 16:03.396
all this together like we did.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.998
Yeah, that's
what I was thinking, so...

16:05.098 --> 16:07.200
using Jeff's phone
going off-line

16:07.300 --> 16:09.936
as a frame of reference
for when he probably got taken,

16:10.037 --> 16:12.372
I retraced his movements
up until that point

16:12.472 --> 16:14.074
and found out

16:14.174 --> 16:15.975
that he used a credit card
at a gas station

16:16.076 --> 16:18.278
just an hour
before he disappeared.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.213
You pull in the cams?
Right here.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.949
Okay, check him out.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.819
There.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.956
Someone else
in the car with him.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.258
Can you zoom in?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.260
Yeah, it's not the '90s.
Of course I can.

16:37.697 --> 16:41.168
Oh, man, that's Juan and Derrick
from the fire station.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.503
They said they hadn't
seen Jeff all weekend.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.871
Right, so much for best friends.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.240
Why would they lie
about being with Jeff

16:47.340 --> 16:49.942
an hour before he
disappeared, unless...

16:50.043 --> 16:52.545
Unless they're the ones
that made him vanish.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.588
Okay, so what are we thinking?
That Juan and Derrick

17:01.688 --> 17:03.190
were in on this scheme,
and then it went bad?

17:03.290 --> 17:05.092
What would make friends
turn on each other like that?

17:05.192 --> 17:06.526
Greed.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.027
Someone wants a bigger cut?

17:08.128 --> 17:09.696
Whoa.
What?

17:09.796 --> 17:12.165
I pulled up Juan
and Derrick's phone records

17:12.265 --> 17:14.734
and their cloud backups
and check out this text exchange

17:14.834 --> 17:17.770
they had just an hour
after Jeff is taken.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.906
"X.M.
called again.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.574
Meet me at the cave."

17:21.674 --> 17:23.610
"X.M."
Why does that sound familiar?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.645
Look at the arson report.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.081
The owner of the restaurant
that Jeff burned down.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.349
Xavier Mannis.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.717
X.M.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.152
Harry, who is this guy?

17:32.252 --> 17:34.053
Xavier Mannis,
let's see.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.423
Two stints in Rikers.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.958
Extortion,
illegal possession of a firearm,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.394
assault, aggravated assault,
attempted murder...

17:41.494 --> 17:43.763
It might be easier to list
the crimes he hasn't committed.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.798
NYPD still has
an open file on him

17:45.898 --> 17:48.801
for, uh, gambling and
loan sharking, and they think

17:48.901 --> 17:51.070
he's been laundering the money
through his restaurants.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.639
But they haven't been able
to charge him with anything.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.641
So with the police
breathing down his neck,

17:54.741 --> 17:56.609
Xavier hires firefighters

17:56.709 --> 17:58.711
to burn down his place
and collects the insurance.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.548
Who better than firemen
to hide the signs of arson?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.950
Okay, but what's
"the cave"?

18:04.050 --> 18:06.953
Yeah, and why were they
in such a rush to get there?

18:09.156 --> 18:10.957
Who you calling?

18:11.057 --> 18:13.025
Someone who may know.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.696
Hello?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.465
Sam, hey.
Did you find him?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.633
We're working really hard,
but not yet.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.903
But I have a question
to ask you that might help.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.538
Do you remember
your dad ever talking

18:25.638 --> 18:27.174
about a place called "the cave"?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.941
It's what he and his friends
call Captain Sanders' house.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.843
They go there all the time
to play poker.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.044
Okay, good.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.646
That's helpful.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.114
Does Captain Sanders know
anything about where my dad is?

18:35.215 --> 18:38.318
I don't know, but...

18:38.418 --> 18:40.720
Look, just stay strong, okay?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.989
I'll call you as soon
as I know anything for sure.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.291
Okay. Thank you.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.393
Please hurry.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.597
All right,
looking into Captain Sanders.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.532
30-year, decorated veteran.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.767
I mean, he was, he was
one of the heroes

18:54.867 --> 18:56.736
down at Ground Zero
right after 9/11.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.805
Oh, yeah,
we saw him at the firehouse.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.573
Could he be involved
in all of this?

19:00.673 --> 19:03.009
I mean, Juan and Derrick
race over to his place

19:03.109 --> 19:05.778
right after Jeff disappears,
it doesn't look great for him.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.023
Rob?

19:17.123 --> 19:18.725
Can you two go over
to the captain's house,

19:18.825 --> 19:20.627
see what he has to say?

19:21.594 --> 19:24.497
I got something to take care of.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.141
All three options
will do the job.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.509
Just depends on your goal.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.845
My goal?

19:41.348 --> 19:43.182
To be honest, I'm not even sure.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.784
I'll break it down
for you.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.587
Colt 1911, semiautomatic.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.256
Very high fire rate.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.757
More quantity than quality.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.293
Colt Single Action Army,
big and scary.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.862
Whoever you point this at's
gonna change their underwear.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.830
Walther P99.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.332
This baby's got
the largest clip.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.369
My personal choice
for the zombie apocalypse.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.571
I shouldn't be here.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.573
I'm...

20:06.673 --> 20:08.341
I'm so sorry for...

20:08.441 --> 20:10.176
for wasting your time.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.645
Can I ask you what happened?

20:13.780 --> 20:16.249
People don't show up
at shooting ranges on a whim.

20:20.353 --> 20:23.290
I just never thought
I'd consider buying a gun.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.757
Most people don't.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.859
Until they need one.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.987
You sure this is
your first time?

21:13.306 --> 21:14.741
Looks like nobody's home.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.909
Let's poke around.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.514
Funny, you're
walking differently

21:21.614 --> 21:23.316
than you did at
the fire station.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.951
What? How?

21:25.051 --> 21:26.819
Oh, what's up?
What's up?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.888
I was not.
Yeah, you totally were.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.090
Look, it's, like, a primal thing

21:31.190 --> 21:32.959
for dudes, you know?
We're like lizards.

21:33.059 --> 21:36.028
Know how they puff their throats
out to appear more menacing?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.664
You know, you got
to let everyone know

21:37.764 --> 21:39.666
that you're not lunch.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.200
What about my lunch?
Well...

21:41.300 --> 21:43.035
Oh, no.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.604
What?

21:44.704 --> 21:46.873
Is it just me or does that
look like a freshly dug grave?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.408
You thinking what I'm thinking?

21:48.508 --> 21:49.842
Unfortunately yes.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.211
There might be shovels
in the garage.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.647
Oh, I have a bad feeling
about this.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.719
No...

22:08.160 --> 22:10.397
I'll just,
I'll be right back.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.833
Mom? Hey.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.702
Is everything okay?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.036
Was gonna ask you
the same thing.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.871
I've been calling
and texting you all morning.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.840
You haven't responded.
Really?

22:20.940 --> 22:23.676
I don't text you back
for a few hours,

22:23.776 --> 22:25.277
and you run me down?

22:25.378 --> 22:26.746
Are you tracking my phone?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.581
Only because I didn't hear
back from you.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.518
After what just happened,
I needed to know you were okay.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.220
Dee, I need to know
where your head is at.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.556
Where my head is at?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.426
My mom is tracking me down
in the middle of the street.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.561
How do you think that
that makes me feel?

22:41.661 --> 22:43.029
That's just it, I don't know!

22:43.129 --> 22:46.265
Not until you let me in
and tell me.

22:48.134 --> 22:51.070
Look, there is nothing
in the world I want more

22:51.170 --> 22:54.006
than for your life to be better.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.409
And I know
I haven't exactly

22:56.509 --> 22:59.245
done that recently.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.949
Hey, Dee?

23:03.683 --> 23:04.784
You coming?

23:09.188 --> 23:11.223
Can we, uh,
talk about this later?

23:11.323 --> 23:12.425
Can we?

23:12.525 --> 23:14.326
I promise.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.865
I'll see you at home.

23:22.835 --> 23:23.870
Hey, Rob.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.304
How's it going?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.039
No sign of the captain,
but looks like something

23:27.139 --> 23:28.775
was recently buried
in the backyard.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.042
Something?

23:30.142 --> 23:31.844
Yeah, like, body-sized.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.946
We're digging now.
Oh, <i>we're</i> digging?

23:34.046 --> 23:36.015
We'll tell you what we find.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.250
I'm on my way to meet Dante
at the fire house.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.419
He's picking up
Derrick and Juan.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.955
About time they start talking.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.025
Right on time.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.094
Looks like they just
got back from a fire.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.200
All good?

23:54.300 --> 23:56.202
It's Sam.
I don't want to lie to her.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.538
I also don't want her
to lose hope.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.873
Not until we know
for sure.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.915
There they are.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.416
That a burn bag?

24:10.517 --> 24:12.985
Be a good way to sneak
stolen cash from a blaze.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.221
You don't think
they pulled another job?

24:15.321 --> 24:17.089
Let's find out.

24:17.189 --> 24:20.292
Yo!
Run for it!

24:21.027 --> 24:22.995
Stop! Police!

24:46.519 --> 24:47.954
Where is he?

24:48.054 --> 24:50.022
Where's Jeff Doyle?

24:52.925 --> 24:54.326
You know, um...

24:54.426 --> 24:56.495
maybe we should be doing this
in shifts, right?

24:56.596 --> 24:57.997
With these shoes? No.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.666
Carry on. Right.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.233
Okay.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.843
That look
like a body bag to you?

25:13.412 --> 25:15.247
Stop!

25:24.190 --> 25:26.258
You got exactly ten seconds
to get the hell off my property.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.060
Easy.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.328
I know you two
from this morning.

25:29.428 --> 25:30.630
A.A. my ass.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.298
Why are you digging up my lawn?

25:32.398 --> 25:35.101
Okay, we're just
looking for Jeff.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.838
Jeff? What the hell makes you
think he'd be in that hole?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.475
We believe that Derrick and Juan

25:43.576 --> 25:44.877
had something to do
with his disappearance.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.113
Right after he
went missing,

25:47.213 --> 25:49.148
we tracked them
to this location.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.549
They came by the other day.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.619
I didn't see them dig any hole.

25:52.719 --> 25:55.454
Hold up, you think
they killed Jeff

25:55.554 --> 25:57.356
and buried him here?

25:57.456 --> 25:59.258
They were like brothers.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.560
Look, with your permission,

26:01.661 --> 26:04.430
we-we'd like to find out.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.418
Is it Jeff?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.022
Only thing dead in here is
a whole lot of presidents.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.394
The hell have
my boys gotten into?

26:36.696 --> 26:39.632
You know
where that money came from?

26:40.800 --> 26:43.736
We think that Jeff,
Derrick and Juan

26:43.836 --> 26:46.438
set fire to a restaurant
to cover robbing it.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.574
Never in a million years

26:48.675 --> 26:50.677
could I imagine them doing

26:50.777 --> 26:53.145
a thing like that, never.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.681
Well, they did.

26:54.781 --> 26:58.617
The question is, why-why did
they bring it here?

27:01.688 --> 27:03.756
Jeff Doyle's missing,
possibly dead.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.457
You and Juan are
the prime suspects.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.093
And you've got nothing
to say to me?

27:08.094 --> 27:09.762
Not ratting on my family.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.130
"Family"?

27:11.230 --> 27:13.766
Juan's halfway to Canada
by now with that money.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.868
Which means you take
the whole rap alone.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.145
You are gonna tell the detective

27:26.245 --> 27:28.180
what he wants to know.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.783
And you're gonna do it now.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.220
Did you steal that money?

27:43.129 --> 27:45.497
Why?
For you!

27:46.766 --> 27:48.100
We did it for you.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.337
Look, it was supposed
to be a one-time deal.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.372
All right, easy.

27:53.472 --> 27:54.707
Nobody gets hurt.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.943
We wanted to help you with...

27:57.043 --> 27:59.011
your situation.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.279
What situation?

28:00.379 --> 28:01.580
My medical condition.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.016
I was a first responder on 9/11.

28:04.116 --> 28:08.154
I, like a lot of us,
ingested a lot of toxic dust.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.655
Developed asthma.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.457
Couple years later,
multiple myeloma.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.860
I was treated,
I-I've been lucky.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.995
I'm in remission, but...
No!

28:16.095 --> 28:18.630
They buried him
in medical bills.

28:18.731 --> 28:19.999
Yeah, but this is not...

28:20.099 --> 28:21.734
Cap, we know you're about
to lose the house.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.035
No, Derrick,
this is not the way...

28:23.135 --> 28:24.136
It's not fair!

28:24.236 --> 28:25.671
It is not fair, Cap!

28:26.873 --> 28:29.508
You almost got killed
down there.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.077
And they hung you
out to dry.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.045
We put our lives
on the line every day

28:33.145 --> 28:34.914
and they don't give
a damn about us, Cap!

28:35.014 --> 28:38.918
Obviously, there's still a lot
of resentment amongst the ranks.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.891
Son...

28:44.991 --> 28:46.959
Listen to me.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.995
The only thing that matters

28:49.095 --> 28:51.998
is what happened to Jeff.
You got to tell me.

28:52.098 --> 28:55.201
Did you do something to Jeff?
No, no.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.602
Then tell me what happened.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.709
When we took the money,

29:03.810 --> 29:06.345
we didn't know
who owned the place.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.480
But we found out
real fast.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.182
Xavier Mannis.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.652
Who's Xavier Mannis?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.321
Not someone you want
to steal from.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.057
He must've saw Jeff
and Angela together.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.326
And realized that he was
using her to case the place.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.094
So after the fire...

29:22.194 --> 29:23.930
He grabbed Jeff.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.966
He told Juan and I
we had 48 hours

29:27.066 --> 29:28.901
to bring him double
what we stole.

29:30.669 --> 29:31.904
Or else Jeff is dead.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.906
That's why you pulled
that job today.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.577
We'd only done it once
before, Juan and I.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.312
We didn't know...

29:40.412 --> 29:42.448
if we'd be able
to pull it off again.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.317
See, that's why we buried the
first score in your yard, Cap.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.887
If anything happened
to us, you'd be notified,

29:47.987 --> 29:50.556
but at least
you'd have the money.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.959
Juan's still planning on taking
that money to Mannis, isn't he?

29:53.059 --> 29:54.726
That's why you wouldn't talk.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.795
You didn't want us
trying to stop him.

29:58.364 --> 30:01.267
When and where's this exchange
supposed to go down?

30:01.367 --> 30:03.302
Mannis said no cops.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.037
All right, as long
as we show up alone

30:05.137 --> 30:07.940
with the money,
he'd let Jeff go.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.009
Consider
who Mannis is.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.879
A career criminal
with a long history of violence.

30:12.979 --> 30:16.215
Just because you keep your word,
you think he'll keep his?

30:32.731 --> 30:34.366
Wake up.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.972
I got your money.
Now let him go.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.211
Slight change of plans.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.382
We had a deal.
<i>Had</i> a deal.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.854
If I let this pass
and word gets out

30:55.955 --> 30:58.390
in the streets
that people can rip me off...

31:00.092 --> 31:02.328
Well, I simply can't have that.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.805
That's Juan's car.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.374
Looks like he made
the meet.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.688
They're inside.
No sign of Mannis.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.123
There's a fire.
We need to save them.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.825
Be careful, we don't
know who else is in there.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.851
You good?
They're gonna burn alive.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.296
Help!
Help us!

32:10.396 --> 32:12.498
Watch out!
Keep going!

32:12.598 --> 32:14.666
Somebody please!
Over here!

32:24.776 --> 32:26.245
You okay?

32:26.345 --> 32:27.846
Yeah, I'm good, go ahead.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.664
Come on!

32:48.500 --> 32:50.936
Hey, backdraft! Backdraft!

32:57.443 --> 32:58.944
We're trapped!

32:59.778 --> 33:01.780
The stairs,
that's our only chance.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.249
Follow me.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.784
Robyn! Robyn,
can you hear me?!

33:05.884 --> 33:08.920
Robyn! Robyn!

33:27.873 --> 33:29.808
You okay?

33:29.908 --> 33:31.110
Yeah.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.194
Could you stop almost dying?

33:48.294 --> 33:50.028
It's killing me.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.763
I'll try.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.999
For you.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.945
Dad!
Sam!

34:07.045 --> 34:09.948
:
Dad!

34:10.048 --> 34:11.450
Hey.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.524
End of the day,
that's what it's all about.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.427
Family.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.982
No, no, no!
What's happening to my money?

34:45.451 --> 34:46.652
The hell?!

34:46.752 --> 34:48.487
No, no, no, no, no!

34:53.725 --> 34:56.128
Xavier Mannis,
you're under arrest.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.197
You got nothing on me.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.299
Actually, we've got you
on attempted murder,

35:00.399 --> 35:02.168
which is your third strike.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.603
Rest of it's just gravy.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.373
Hands behind your back.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.808
Let's go.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.948
Ah, it's a beautiful
thing, isn't it?

35:17.048 --> 35:19.485
What, your mustache?
Well, yes, that of course.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.119
But when a guy like...

35:21.220 --> 35:22.988
Xavier Mannis can turn over
a new leaf

35:23.088 --> 35:24.690
and embrace
the joys of philanthropy.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.159
Yeah, it's the perfect way
to clean dirty money.

35:27.259 --> 35:29.195
Give it to a good cause.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.557
Hey.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.992
Hey.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.896
So...

36:04.996 --> 36:07.799
you finally gonna show me
what you've been working on?

36:07.899 --> 36:09.435
Mm-mm.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.870
It's not like that.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.241
You do not get to stroll in here

36:15.341 --> 36:17.776
as if everything is okay.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.745
You didn't call,
you didn't text,

36:19.845 --> 36:21.947
you did not tell me
what this case was about.

36:22.047 --> 36:24.883
Things got a little bit...
You broke our agreement.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.552
Listen,
if it had been dangerous,

36:26.652 --> 36:28.520
I promise
I would have called.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.188
<i>If</i> it was dangerous?

36:30.289 --> 36:32.591
Is that why you smell
like a bonfire?

36:32.691 --> 36:35.261
What I meant was...

36:36.194 --> 36:39.631
...if I knew it was dangerous
to you or Dee.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.970
But that doesn't
make it right.

36:45.070 --> 36:48.039
So... I'm sorry.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.116
And I know exactly how you feel.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.787
I hunted Dee down today
because she didn't text me back.

37:01.887 --> 37:05.223
Then I did the same thing
to you.
Robyn?

37:05.324 --> 37:07.693
I understand that you have
a certain...

37:09.127 --> 37:10.729
...skill set.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.632
That makes you feel
that you have a responsibility

37:13.732 --> 37:15.734
to help others.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.536
Aunt Vi...
No, no, hear me out.

37:17.636 --> 37:20.038
You have
to understand something.

37:20.138 --> 37:22.774
I have a responsibility, too.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.110
To protect Dee.

37:27.112 --> 37:28.880
And you.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.717
Even if you don't
think you need it.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.852
And that starts with me knowing

37:33.952 --> 37:36.322
what the hell is going on.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.624
Okay, okay.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.759
I hear you, Auntie.

37:40.859 --> 37:43.529
But the hard truth is...

37:43.629 --> 37:45.030
I will never

37:45.130 --> 37:47.265
be able to tell you everything.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.638
But what I can promise...

37:52.738 --> 37:55.040
is to do better.

37:57.242 --> 37:58.944
I can.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.882
I'm gonna hold you to that.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.253
I know.

38:13.258 --> 38:16.294
Dee's upstairs.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.096
She's been waiting for you.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.133
I'm gonna go talk to her.

38:29.475 --> 38:31.343
Hey.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.379
Before you say anything...

38:34.813 --> 38:36.948
Mom, I know you're
only checking up on me

38:37.048 --> 38:39.317
because you're worried.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.453
Because of what happened.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.789
But, Mom, I'm okay.

38:45.290 --> 38:48.627
I'm not saying
that it wasn't a big deal.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.729
But really, Mom.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.064
I'm good.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.668
I mean, I feel like
I've come out

38:56.768 --> 38:58.470
of my...

38:58.570 --> 39:01.339
PTSD issues...

39:01.440 --> 39:03.675
even stronger.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.345
Like I can really handle this.

39:10.949 --> 39:13.184
I don't doubt that.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.487
But this is what I do.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.723
And even
I'm struggling a bit.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.226
What do you mean?

39:23.529 --> 39:25.096
Hard to sleep.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.565
Crazy dreams.

39:26.665 --> 39:27.699
Dreams?

39:27.799 --> 39:30.969
Weird dreams,
disturbing dreams.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.104
Hey.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.708
Well...

39:36.808 --> 39:40.211
well, maybe I'm the one who
should be checking up on you.

39:42.514 --> 39:45.350
Maybe you should.

39:46.652 --> 39:49.387
Do you know
how much I love you?

39:49.488 --> 39:52.123
I love you, too.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.129
And I understand it.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.767
But...

40:01.867 --> 40:04.102
it's a lot.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.440
Well, just know
that everything I do,

40:08.540 --> 40:11.009
is just me
trying to help.

40:14.646 --> 40:17.082
I get it.

40:20.351 --> 40:23.388
Mom, if you really
want to help,

40:23.489 --> 40:25.924
don't smother me.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.461
Train me.
