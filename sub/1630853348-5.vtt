WEBVTT

00:08.258 --> 00:09.926
all: Open it! Open it!
- Happy birthday, Ashley!

00:09.968 --> 00:11.219
- Aww, what's this one?
- Ooh!

00:11.261 --> 00:12.554
- It's the first bronzer
that doubles

00:12.595 --> 00:14.347
as a low-cal butter substitute.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.683
- I think it's German.
- Ooh.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.602
[all squealing]
- Oh, my God, you guys!

00:19.644 --> 00:22.105
- [screams]
- Oh, my God!

00:22.147 --> 00:24.107
- It's the Nokia 879
Switch Splazz.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.525
- We pooled our per diems.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.986
- You can text people
any number

00:28.028 --> 00:30.447
and all the letters
A through J.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.866
- Too kewl.
Ooh, ooh, let's do my message.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.243
You've reached Ashley's Splazz.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.579
* Leave a message
if you love me *

00:37.620 --> 00:40.040
Oh, I love you guys!
- We love you! We love you!

00:40.081 --> 00:42.167
- Birthday hug!
all: Aww!

00:42.208 --> 00:43.752
- Okay, okay.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.920
Now let's go blow the doors
off the Dad's Choice Awards!

00:45.962 --> 00:48.423
[all cheering]

00:48.465 --> 00:51.134
all: * Gonna be famous 5eva *

00:51.176 --> 00:54.888
* 'Cause 4eva's too short *
- * It's too short *

00:54.929 --> 00:57.932
all:
* Gonna be famous 3gether *

00:57.974 --> 01:01.978
* 'Cause that's 1 more
than 2gether *

01:02.020 --> 01:04.939
* Gonna be famous 5eva *

01:04.981 --> 01:07.650
* 'Cause 4eva's too short *

01:07.692 --> 01:10.362
* So what are you waiting 5? *

01:10.403 --> 01:14.741
* Girls5eva *

01:17.327 --> 01:19.245
[upbeat music]

01:19.287 --> 01:20.497
- Top of the Wednesday!

01:20.538 --> 01:23.041
- Guys, I think
I cracked our love song.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.292
- [gasps]
- I've been grinding it

01:24.334 --> 01:25.585
in my head for days,

01:25.627 --> 01:27.879
and then it just shot
into my brain.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.255
It's about eye contact.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.257
- Wow.
- Ooh, V sexual.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.885
- Yeah, the eyes are
the windows to the 0-9s.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.220
- To the what?

01:35.261 --> 01:38.056
- The 0-9s. The genitals?

01:38.098 --> 01:41.142
Genitals. Jennys? No?

01:41.184 --> 01:44.104
You know the song "Jenny"?
867-5309?

01:44.145 --> 01:45.563
The 0-9s!

01:45.605 --> 01:46.981
Come on, guys,
get with my slang.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.149
I sent you a PDF.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.860
[quirky music]

01:50.902 --> 01:53.279
- There you go.
[metal detector beeps]

01:53.321 --> 01:56.491
- What's up with the security?
- Hey, Paul. What's going on?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.910
- Can't say who's here,
but whenever an A-lister

01:58.952 --> 02:01.162
with a stalker or two
is in the building,

02:01.204 --> 02:03.123
we throw up
extra security measures.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.541
- I also have a stalker.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.418
He lives in Canada
and stalks remotely.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.836
We met at camp.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.421
- Oh, my gosh. You guys.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.050
T.K. is recording here?
[gasps]

02:14.092 --> 02:15.677
Oh, my God.
- T-who?

02:15.719 --> 02:17.887
- She's one of those stars
who never shows their face,

02:17.929 --> 02:20.557
like Daft Punk,
Orville Peck, deadmau5.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.685
The list goes on and on,
but I'm done listing.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.730
- She's like a sexy beekeeper.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.189
- Oh.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.858
Hey!
[laughs]

02:29.899 --> 02:35.864
* *

02:35.905 --> 02:38.742
[metal detector beeps]
- Oh, my IUD is white gold.

02:38.783 --> 02:42.871
It's Kate Hudson for Pandora
for Pfizer BioNTech.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.330
- Oh, okay.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.459
- "Your Eyes." Here we go.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.294
[metronome counting down]

02:49.336 --> 02:54.174
all:
* Your eyes tell me a story *

02:54.215 --> 02:58.762
* Of where our road will wind *

02:58.803 --> 03:03.641
* Our eyes tell me a story *

03:03.683 --> 03:07.562
* Half yours, half mine *

03:07.604 --> 03:10.440
- * Half mine *
all: * Half yours *

03:10.482 --> 03:13.234
* Ooh *

03:13.276 --> 03:14.736
[all cheering]

03:14.778 --> 03:17.739
- Label's gonna love that.
Really fires up the 0-9s.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.657
- Oh, somebody read the PDF.
Thanks!

03:19.699 --> 03:22.535
- Gonna send this demo
off to Tate.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.289
- Dawn, is that a mayo packet?
Oh, no. No, no, no.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.999
- What? I ran out of lip stuff.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.085
- Honey, what is
your self-care routine?

03:30.126 --> 03:32.379
- She's usually still chewing
when she enters a bathroom.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.922
- Ugh!
- I'm busy.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.757
- You need a break.

03:35.799 --> 03:40.887
I am making you an appointment
for a massage at my MedSpa.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.263
I've only been
to the "Spa" part,

03:42.305 --> 03:43.640
never the "Med".

03:43.682 --> 03:44.808
- Right.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.018
- Because I've never
done anything

03:47.060 --> 03:48.478
to my face or my butt.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.646
It's just natural.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.606
- No, I don't think I should go

03:51.648 --> 03:53.358
'cause this studio time
is precious.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.567
- Even I think you need
to take a moment,

03:54.609 --> 03:56.319
and I invented Album Mode.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.071
- I usually work out knots

03:58.113 --> 04:00.365
by leaning against
the hot pipe in my apartment.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.783
- Go.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.869
Gloria and I will
keep the train moving.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.498
- Uh, hey, uh, real quick
before you go,

04:08.540 --> 04:11.418
I think the beekeeper suit lady
is Ashley.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.503
- Oh, God.
- Gloria, please.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.673
- Now, we all agree
Ashley faked her own death.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.341
Hot take, I'm starting to think

04:18.383 --> 04:19.968
that Ashley faked
her own death.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.887
The fall from the infinity pool
was not high enough.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.306
I threw a dummy
from that same height,

04:25.348 --> 04:26.850
and only the feet detached.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.645
What if it's like...
* Why was it a closed casket? *

04:30.687 --> 04:33.773
* Because it was empty,
that's why *

04:33.815 --> 04:35.483
She had a magician boyfriend,

04:35.525 --> 04:37.569
and all deaths in Vegas
are suspicious.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.654
Top of the Wednesday!

04:39.696 --> 04:41.031
- Listen,
I love a good theory--

04:41.072 --> 04:43.074
I think Sienna Miller
is secret twins--

04:43.116 --> 04:44.659
but Ashley is gone.

04:44.701 --> 04:48.329
- But see, Google can't verify
T.K.'s age

04:48.371 --> 04:49.789
or her hand texture,

04:49.831 --> 04:52.417
and they both
throw up peace signs,

04:52.459 --> 04:54.294
and their voices are identical.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.503
Listen.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.213
[sirens wailing, gunshots]

04:57.255 --> 04:58.631
Freaking autoplay.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.343
Sorry, these old action movies
are the only thing

05:01.384 --> 05:04.846
that keeps my dad from
revealing himself to his nurse.

05:04.888 --> 05:09.142
Okay, listen to Ashley
in the remix of "Famous 5eva."

05:09.184 --> 05:12.145
- * Checking out the hotties
with their sexy bodies *

05:12.187 --> 05:14.147
* Still drinking
Veuve Clicquot champagne *

05:14.189 --> 05:16.191
* We all got Maseratis *

05:16.232 --> 05:18.568
- Now listen to T.K.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.028
[electronic music]

05:20.070 --> 05:22.739
- * What's the weather
in your mouth, babe? *

05:22.781 --> 05:25.075
- * What's the weather
in your mouth? *

05:25.116 --> 05:26.368
* *

05:27.077 --> 05:29.287
- Oh, honey,
that is so auto-tuned.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.538
It could be anyone.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.916
- Gloria, we all miss Ashley,
but I think

05:32.957 --> 05:35.293
you've been listening
to too many crime podcasts.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.128
- I think T.K.
is Meghan Markle.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.964
Or a disgraced oil heiress,
or a redhead.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.676
Or some daughter
of a DJ named Beth

05:42.717 --> 05:44.844
who needed a gimmick.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.388
- Okay.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.641
- [laughing]
- Oh, that was so nice!

05:49.683 --> 05:51.726
I got a Cold Stone massage.
- Ooh!

05:51.768 --> 05:53.269
- Where they incorporate
ice cream.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.897
- Oh, I love that one.
Yeah, this spa is so great.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.066
Can't speak hide nor hare
about the "Med" part.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.567
Never been.
[laughs]

05:59.609 --> 06:01.569
Have you heard
about these thread lifts

06:01.611 --> 06:03.405
everybody's getting, though?

06:03.446 --> 06:06.074
They say, like, they put string
underneath your skin,

06:06.116 --> 06:09.577
and then they sort of, like,
tie it up at your forehead.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.413
That's crazy, right?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.873
Or...normal?

06:13.915 --> 06:15.542
- Crazy.
- Yes. Sorry.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.293
- No, Summer, don't be
one of those women.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.005
You don't wanna look like Susan
from "Guess Who."

06:20.046 --> 06:21.214
- Oh, for sure.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.008
It's like I said in "Maxim"
when I was 19.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.051
I'm never gonna do
plastic surgery.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.469
That's binding.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.055
[phone chimes]
- Ooh, text from Tate.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.100
"Love the love song.
Can you pop over?"

06:32.142 --> 06:34.936
- You wrote us a hit!

06:34.978 --> 06:37.397
- What if we just start
with all the words we know?

06:37.439 --> 06:40.525
Uh...
* Terrace *

06:40.567 --> 06:42.652
* Biscotti *

06:42.694 --> 06:44.446
* Tornado *

06:44.487 --> 06:47.782
- You know, I was thinking,
what if we went even deeper?

06:47.824 --> 06:50.118
- Oh, yeah.
- Here, sit right here.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.164
Okay, finish this sentence
in your notebook, okay?

06:55.373 --> 06:58.877
Wickie Roy is...

06:58.918 --> 07:00.462
- Five-dimensional.
- Mm.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.464
- Fearless.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.966
[laughs]
Funny.

07:05.008 --> 07:08.094
[both laugh]

07:09.346 --> 07:12.057
A keen observer.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.060
- Ladies,
thank you five coming.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.812
That love song,
I was like, "The boppery!"

07:17.854 --> 07:19.105
[laughter]
- Thank you.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.107
- One thing I wanted to flag:
so there's a guy

07:21.149 --> 07:23.276
who works here who has kids,
and when he heard it,

07:23.318 --> 07:25.445
he was like--well,
I can't really do him justice

07:25.487 --> 07:27.864
'cause he's so tired,
but he goes,

07:27.906 --> 07:29.199
"I've heard that song."

07:29.240 --> 07:30.992
- Oh,
like at the future Grammys.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.787
- No, um,
I guess it's the theme song

07:33.828 --> 07:35.830
to some kids' show,
"Bobby Baloney,"

07:35.872 --> 07:38.249
about a cow-pig
that can see the future.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.003
- * Your eyes
tell me a story *

07:42.045 --> 07:44.381
* Of where
our road will wind *

07:44.422 --> 07:46.591
* Our eyes tell me a story *

07:46.633 --> 07:48.551
* Half bovine, half swine *

07:48.593 --> 07:50.804
* Half cow, moo *

07:50.845 --> 07:52.222
* Half pig *

07:52.263 --> 07:53.348
[snorts]

07:53.390 --> 07:54.933
- Ugh, I used to show
"Bobby Baloney"

07:54.974 --> 07:56.393
to Max when he was a baby.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.645
It must have filed away
in my subconscious somewhere.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.230
- Obviously,
it was an accident,

08:00.271 --> 08:03.024
but we can't afford the rights
and we can't risk a lawsuit.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.859
The other thing is,
you guys only have

08:04.901 --> 08:06.611
a couple weeks left
in the studio,

08:06.653 --> 08:09.489
so if the love song thing
is tripping you up,

08:09.531 --> 08:11.408
just scrap it
and open things up.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.535
Revenge songs are hot.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.203
Adele wrote a song about wine.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.623
It's time to get
in the quantity business.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.000
- Copy. Yes. Got it.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.584
- Oh, and whatever you make,
it'd be amazing

08:21.626 --> 08:24.629
if it were the exact length of
a teenager's skincare routine.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.881
- 3 minutes, 45 seconds.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.843
- Look at you on a roll.
Right on.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.594
- We're writing my story.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.972
Is it cheating
to invent a dead parent?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.266
It always seems to hook people,
right, Glo--

08:38.768 --> 08:41.396
Where is Gloria?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.398
- Oh, I just saw her outside.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.567
- That little stinktress!

08:45.608 --> 08:46.735
[crowd chattering]

08:46.776 --> 08:48.486
- Excuse me,
age before toddlers.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.530
Excuse me.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.781
Hey, you're a stalker, right?

08:51.823 --> 08:53.575
You must know
who's under the suit.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.368
- Hey! My privacy!

08:55.410 --> 08:57.037
- Can you hear yourself?

08:57.078 --> 08:58.580
Oh!
[crowd screaming]

08:58.621 --> 09:00.457
- Oh, my God!

09:00.498 --> 09:03.084
- Hi, just make it out to,

09:03.126 --> 09:04.919
"It's me, Gloria.
It's okay.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.963
You can tell me
it's you, Ashley."

09:07.005 --> 09:08.840
Okay, I get it.
There's a lot of people around.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.342
Just let me measure your feet.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.384
- [in deep voice]
Sorry.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.053
I'm not who you think I am.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.763
Toodles!

09:16.473 --> 09:17.807
- Okay, you done?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.809
She just said she's not Ashley.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.936
End of story.
- Prologue of story.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.813
She just proved it's her.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.569
- [screaming]

09:29.611 --> 09:32.989
- If you were a poker hand...
- Dang autoplay!

09:33.031 --> 09:35.742
- You'd be four jokers
and a piece of shit.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.412
- Okay, I have everything from
loading up Ashley's hologram,

09:39.454 --> 09:41.748
all the way back
to when she was in commercials.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.500
Look at this.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.752
[upbeat electronic music]

09:45.794 --> 09:47.128
- Meet The 'Tudle!

09:47.170 --> 09:49.339
The smallest backpacklet
on the market.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.260
* *

09:54.302 --> 09:57.055
The 'Tudle!
Try and find it at Wanamaker's.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.976
- This proves what?

10:02.018 --> 10:03.812
- The 'Tudle?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.772
Outside, T.K. said "Toodles!"

10:05.814 --> 10:07.273
I mean,
that can't be an accident.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.443
- Well, we're back and even
behinder than this morning.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.363
The love song is dead.
I'm a plagiarizer.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.531
- What?

10:14.572 --> 10:15.949
- [scoffs]
It's okay.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.159
We'll just--we'll write
another one.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.577
- Well,
I should probably check

10:19.619 --> 10:21.705
that "Momentum" isn't just
the "Facts of Life" theme.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.081
I'm worse than Robin Thicke.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.499
- No one is worse
than Robin Thicke.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.126
- Maybe these guys
cracked something.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.794
- When T.K. gets back
from lunch,

10:27.836 --> 10:28.962
I'm gonna rip her mask off.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.839
- I'm gonna take that as a no.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.176
- Her bodyguards are short,
so you know they do violence!

10:36.678 --> 10:38.471
When will this end?

10:38.513 --> 10:41.891
You thought Ashley was
in the Polyphonic Spree.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.143
You thought she was
a tollbooth worker

10:43.184 --> 10:44.769
that you saw
by the Holland Tunnel

10:44.811 --> 10:46.104
who was Black.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.648
- And had the same tattoo
of a Tasmanian devil

10:48.690 --> 10:50.275
getting head from a butterfly.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.860
- You need to move on here.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.820
- Of course
you'd tell me to move on.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.822
That's what you do best.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.240
You moved on so fast,

10:57.282 --> 11:00.368
you didn't even come
to Ashley's bench dedication.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.163
- I was in LA
getting my wax figure cast.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.748
I suffered too!
- Oh, please.

11:04.789 --> 11:08.376
- I had straws in my mouth
and butt so nothing bubbled.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.128
If you don't,
you risk a bunny tail!

11:10.170 --> 11:13.048
- Well, I know T.K. is her.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.175
- If you look hard enough
at any old video,

11:15.216 --> 11:18.845
you can bend your brain
to find a clue.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.556
[all cheering]
- Dads, Dads!

11:21.598 --> 11:24.601
- I can't believe we won
a freaking DCA!

11:24.642 --> 11:27.771
- Tom Arnold was so nice!

11:27.812 --> 11:29.481
- We are breathing rare air!

11:29.522 --> 11:30.523
- That's right!

11:30.565 --> 11:34.361
- Wow, this is too kewl!

11:34.402 --> 11:38.782
- Wickie, she just put a big T
and a K on that mirror.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.658
- And other letters too.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.204
As your friend,

11:44.245 --> 11:48.792
if I can prove to you
that T.K. is not Ashley,

11:48.833 --> 11:51.044
will you drop this for good?

11:51.086 --> 11:54.339
- You're gonna help me?
I fucking love you!

11:54.381 --> 11:56.549
It's her.
- It's not her.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.093
- Oh, yeah.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.638
- [gasps]
Ooh!

12:01.680 --> 12:03.264
What about something

12:03.306 --> 12:06.476
from the perspective
of a waiting fisherman's wife?

12:06.518 --> 12:07.852
[piano playing]

12:07.894 --> 12:10.855
* See, see *

12:10.897 --> 12:14.317
* See seaman's first-- *
Fuck.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.944
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.113
Everybody accidentally
borrows stuff.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.573
Being sued
by Marvin Gaye's nephews

12:20.615 --> 12:22.075
is a rite of passage.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.244
- Oh, my God,
the line at Sweetgreen

12:24.285 --> 12:27.330
was crazy long
like it was for sneakers.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.958
- Summer, you got
the thread lift.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.293
- What? I would never!

12:32.335 --> 12:34.462
No, it's probably just
a delayed response

12:34.504 --> 12:35.839
from the massage.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.757
You know, I've been drinking
a lot of green juice.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.259
I'm in a really good place.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.885
Japanese sweet potatoes.
Turmeric.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.972
- Sometimes people say a lot
of reasons when they're lying.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.682
- No, I'm just--
I'm very well rested.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.435
I've been avoiding nightshades,
you know?

12:48.476 --> 12:51.021
Silk pillowcases.
Cutting down on screen time.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.398
Decluttering.
Alkaline water. Manuka.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.234
Bone broth and...gratitude.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.070
[soft piano music]

12:59.112 --> 13:00.697
- [clears throat]

13:00.739 --> 13:05.285
* I know I can trust *

13:05.326 --> 13:08.288
* Shapiro and Brandt *

13:08.329 --> 13:11.499
* Commercial litigation *

13:11.541 --> 13:12.834
[plays discordant chord]
- Hmm.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.336
The more personal you get,

13:14.377 --> 13:16.629
the less likely it's gonna feel
like it's something else.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.632
- Ooh, should we do a song
about honest, natural beauty?

13:19.674 --> 13:21.301
- You know what always
gets juices flowing?

13:21.343 --> 13:22.927
Who are you mad at?

13:22.969 --> 13:25.055
- Tate did say
that revenge songs

13:25.096 --> 13:26.598
are very hot.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.641
Who's wronged us?

13:28.683 --> 13:33.313
- * Threw us together
in a motel room *

13:33.355 --> 13:37.734
* Promised we'd be
famous soon *

13:37.776 --> 13:41.363
* Made his money
on a basement zoo *

13:41.404 --> 13:45.325
* Saw the Spice Girls, said,
"I can pick girls too" *

13:45.367 --> 13:47.494
- Yes! Oh, my God,
this is about Larry.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.329
Wait, um...

13:49.371 --> 13:53.792
* Cranked our tanning booth
to ten *

13:53.833 --> 13:57.128
- * Dyed his arm hairs black
and then *

13:57.170 --> 14:00.006
- Raymond, go!
Hit the special button!

14:00.048 --> 14:01.841
We're in the pocket!

14:01.883 --> 14:04.135
[both scatting]

14:04.177 --> 14:05.720
* Don't get fat *

14:08.264 --> 14:09.641
- I taped these

14:09.683 --> 14:11.935
to all the other women's
bathrooms in the building.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.188
A bathroom "Out of Order" sign
is as respected in this country

14:15.230 --> 14:17.357
as the flag
or James Earl Jones.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.776
- Yes, I never question them!

14:19.818 --> 14:23.321
The human bladder is the reason
that most stakeouts fall apart,

14:23.363 --> 14:25.156
so this is an ideal situation.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.158
- T.K.'s not gonna
just take off her mask

14:27.200 --> 14:28.326
because we ask.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.704
We have to be delicate
and precise.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.206
You already had
your shot with her.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.916
Now, let me take mine.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.085
- Okay. By all means.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.507
- * Leaving the stage,
we hear through a cough *

14:42.549 --> 14:47.387
both: * "Looks like talent
took the day off" *

14:47.429 --> 14:49.556
- * Only let us *
both: * Eat crab *

14:49.597 --> 14:51.891
- * 'Cause you can't *
both: * Get fat *

14:51.933 --> 14:53.309
- * From food that's *

14:53.351 --> 14:55.603
both: * So damn hard *
- * To get at *

14:55.645 --> 14:57.355
both: * Sketchy financials *

14:57.397 --> 15:00.275
- * 98% commission *

15:00.316 --> 15:02.193
both: * Our tour was only
through countries *

15:02.235 --> 15:04.571
- * With no extradition *

15:04.612 --> 15:08.658
both: * 20 years later,
we can still hear him say *

15:08.700 --> 15:12.704
* "You work like dogs,
the kind that sleep all day" *

15:12.746 --> 15:17.459
* But now we're at the wheel *

15:17.500 --> 15:21.546
* You can take the bus *

15:21.588 --> 15:24.674
* 'Cause everything we do *

15:24.716 --> 15:28.928
* Belongs to us *

15:28.970 --> 15:31.014
[both squeal]

15:31.056 --> 15:33.558
- Oh, this is
cathartic as hell!

15:33.600 --> 15:35.226
[both laugh]

15:35.268 --> 15:38.063
- Wow, y'all. Wow.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.440
- Larry?
What are you doing here?

15:40.482 --> 15:43.818
- Collab's in Studio Five,
and we had some extra Brofu.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.154
- Ugh.
- So I hope you had some fun,

15:46.196 --> 15:49.449
because that song is never
gonna see the light of day.

15:49.491 --> 15:51.576
- Why is that?
- Because it's theft!

15:51.618 --> 15:54.871
That's my life.
My story. Mine to tell.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.456
You're a Bad Art Friend.

15:56.498 --> 16:00.043
- That's not how Bad Art Friend
works, Larry.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.670
Girls5eva lived this story.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.673
- But you lifted
my words verbato.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.716
"You work like dogs,
the kind that sleep all day."

16:06.758 --> 16:08.176
That's mine.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.053
"Looks like talent
took the day off."

16:10.095 --> 16:11.513
Also mine.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.807
"You're replaceable
as baby teeth."

16:13.848 --> 16:15.475
This is plagiarism.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.310
You use it, you're buying
yourself a lawsuit.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.478
You want a lawsuit?

16:18.520 --> 16:20.897
- No, courtroom lighting
is really bad.

16:20.939 --> 16:23.817
- All right, now, look,
I'm a reasonable guy, now.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.235
Evolved.

16:25.276 --> 16:28.405
I only walk around
with medium dick energy.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.324
So how about you can
put the song on your album

16:31.366 --> 16:33.493
if you throw me
a cowriting credit

16:33.535 --> 16:36.204
and you add a thing
where you say I'm tall.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.456
- No way, Larry!
- Ew.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.001
- You look good. Manuka?

16:41.042 --> 16:43.003
- [sighs]

16:43.044 --> 16:45.005
[tense quirky music]

16:45.046 --> 16:48.008
[faucet running]

16:48.049 --> 16:50.010
* *

16:50.051 --> 16:53.304
- Oh, my God. T.K., right?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.682
Ugh, I'm so glad you're here.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.935
- Do we know each other?
- Wickie. Roy.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.353
Recording artist.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.730
Look, I just found out

17:01.771 --> 17:04.024
my stalker is hanging
around the building.

17:04.065 --> 17:07.402
You get it.
I need to slip out undetected.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.238
Otherwise, he'll try to take
some of my eyelashes.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.199
Could I borrow your suit?

17:13.241 --> 17:14.951
- I'm sorry, love, I can't.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.495
I can lend you a bodyguard
to get out, though.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.831
- Oh, no. It's okay.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.334
- Oh, no,
I just saw on Toilet TV

17:22.375 --> 17:25.003
that the Hockley 459
beekeeper headdress

17:25.045 --> 17:28.631
and accompanying veil have been
recalled for suffocation risk!

17:28.673 --> 17:30.717
Anyone wearing one
should take it off now.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.470
- I'm going to find
a different bathroom.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.138
- It's not Ashley.
The smells are all wrong.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.514
Stand down.
- I gotta know!

17:36.556 --> 17:38.183
- Gloria!
- Hey!

17:38.224 --> 17:40.477
[both grunting]

17:40.518 --> 17:42.270
[high-pitched]
Ow!

17:42.312 --> 17:43.980
My mystique!

17:48.568 --> 17:51.321
- Gloria, rude!

17:51.363 --> 17:53.531
- You're not her?
- I'm not who?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.492
Ow! That hurt!

17:55.533 --> 17:57.410
- How could you not be
our friend Ashley?

17:57.452 --> 18:00.205
- Ugh, I am so sick of being
a Rorschach blot

18:00.246 --> 18:01.748
for other people's crap.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.792
Everyone thinks I'm JFK Jr.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.835
or their high school girlfriend

18:05.877 --> 18:08.421
or Carole Baskin's
dead husband.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.465
I'm just Beth.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.468
My dad's a DJ,
and we agreed I needed a thing!

18:13.510 --> 18:15.595
- Oh, my God, did I call it.

18:15.637 --> 18:18.932
- Whoever you thought I was,
they are gone.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.519
So just deal with your crap
and leave me out of it!

18:24.646 --> 18:26.523
[in deep voice]
Goodbye, bitches.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.942
[voice rises]
Tell no one what you saw here.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.444
Dang it!
You ruined my mystique.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.364
I'm supposed to walk a tiger
in Machine Gun Kelly's wedding,

18:34.406 --> 18:36.282
and now I'm all scared!

18:36.324 --> 18:39.828
[quirky music]

18:39.869 --> 18:42.789
- No, Larry's bluffing.
He's not gonna sue us.

18:42.831 --> 18:46.668
- He sued a Starbucks for not
being where he thought it was.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.962
I think we should
take his deal.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.506
- We cannot give Larry
writing credit

18:51.548 --> 18:53.508
on our song that rips him.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.010
- He is quoted all over it.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.554
I know it's gross,
but if this is the only way

18:57.595 --> 18:59.514
that people are
gonna hear it...

18:59.556 --> 19:01.182
- Then I'd rather kill
the song.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.934
- But we need songs!

19:02.976 --> 19:07.022
Dawn, you heard Tate.
We're so behind.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.523
God!

19:08.565 --> 19:10.775
I just think that we just need

19:10.817 --> 19:13.445
to get really honest
about where we are right now.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.363
- Really, I should get honest?

19:15.405 --> 19:17.365
Your thread lift's caught
on the soundproofing, isn't it?

19:17.407 --> 19:19.784
- What? No!

19:19.826 --> 19:24.080
I'm just casual, you know?
Green juice culture.

19:24.122 --> 19:27.250
Intermittent fasting
and apple cider vinegar.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.128
Cupping. I've gone paperless.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.546
- You are ridiculous.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.715
- I just want this song
on the album, Dawn!

19:33.757 --> 19:36.801
- Yeah, so do I, but it's dead.
Get a shovel.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.845
- Ugh!
- We have no album.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.222
I think Gloria
bought MasterClass.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.058
Maybe Paul Simon did one.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.768
- [grunting]

19:46.102 --> 19:48.146
- Okay.
- Oh!

19:49.814 --> 19:52.400
- You'll find that I'm a man
of many talents.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.568
- Freaking autoplay.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.903
- [screams]

19:54.944 --> 19:57.572
- Looks like talent
took the day off.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.658
- Wait, what did he say?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.036
- I said I'm sorry!
- We signed the NDA!

20:06.289 --> 20:07.582
- God.

20:07.624 --> 20:10.085
Really thought it was her.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.837
[sighs]
What the hell is wrong with me?

20:12.879 --> 20:16.216
- You just want it to be her
because the truth is too hard.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.927
Ashley fell off
an infinity pool drunk.

20:18.968 --> 20:22.097
It was the number one cause
of hot person death in 2003.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.556
- T.K. is right.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.850
I got a lot of shit
to deal with.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.019
I am bad at letting go.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.938
I have a Sims character
named Val

20:29.979 --> 20:33.441
who's been shooting hoops
for 20 years.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.444
[soft music]

20:36.486 --> 20:38.488
* *

20:38.530 --> 20:40.615
- Part of me thought
it was her too.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.826
- You did?
- Or hoped it was her.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.123
I didn't skip
Ashley's bench ceremony

20:48.164 --> 20:50.667
because I was busy.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.670
I skipped it
because it was too hard.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.842
I loved Ashley.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.385
She was the only one
in the group

21:00.427 --> 21:02.637
I didn't think
I was better than.

21:02.679 --> 21:06.099
- [laughs tearily]

21:06.141 --> 21:08.101
- Sometimes,

21:08.143 --> 21:11.980
I still call her phone
to hear her outgoing message.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.690
Her parents never
turned it off, you know.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.859
- That's me.
I've been paying that bill.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.570
I still call her like an idiot,

21:18.611 --> 21:21.197
and I just keep hoping
she's gonna pick it up.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.659
I think this is
just all bubbling up

21:24.701 --> 21:26.828
because we're all working
together again.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.830
And it just really
fucking sucks

21:28.872 --> 21:31.166
that she can't be part
of any of it!

21:31.207 --> 21:33.543
- I know.
- [sighs]

21:34.627 --> 21:37.672
- Maybe she can.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.424
- So you've come
to your senses.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.759
Smart.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.970
I want my name spelled
all lowercase, cool.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.680
- Yeah, well,
we've been thinking,

21:45.722 --> 21:47.766
and given the amount
of direct quotes,

21:47.807 --> 21:50.435
we're willing to share
writing credit on the track.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.937
With Mort Howard.
- Who?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.231
- The writer
of "Designated Interest,"

21:55.273 --> 21:58.026
the 1994 Steven Seagal
punch saga.

21:58.068 --> 22:01.446
- All of the insults
that you hurled at us

22:01.488 --> 22:03.448
came from that movie.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.743
- You work like a dog,
the kind that sleeps all day.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.661
But you forgot one thing,
Scalabrini:

22:08.703 --> 22:09.913
my kicking.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.499
- Okay, okay.
It's hard to be original.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.918
Look, every guy is shaped

22:14.959 --> 22:17.170
by a cool movie
that they quote incessantly.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.963
In almost all cases,
it's "Fight Club."

22:19.005 --> 22:20.340
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.675
Forget about my credit.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.635
Where are we with adding
the thing where I'm tall?

22:23.677 --> 22:25.512
- No!

22:25.553 --> 22:28.431
"Now get out of my airspace."

22:28.473 --> 22:31.226
- A girl quoting a movie.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.310
[laughs]

22:32.352 --> 22:33.937
That's never happened
in the world.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.106
You're a trailblazer, Dawn.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.109
[both squeal]

22:39.150 --> 22:40.610
That was amazing!

22:40.652 --> 22:41.986
And, listen, honey,

22:42.028 --> 22:44.698
while we're being all brave
and trailblazing,

22:44.739 --> 22:47.992
Dawn, I need to tell you
something about my face.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.911
- Oh, Summer,
I know what you did.

22:49.953 --> 22:53.206
- It's not just all
infrared saunas,

22:53.248 --> 22:55.709
wellness, gong baths,

22:55.750 --> 22:58.086
plant-based diet,
returning to my breath.

22:58.128 --> 23:00.463
- No, you got a thread lift.
- I got a thread lift.

23:00.505 --> 23:04.926
I have been to the "Med" part
of the MedSpa.

23:04.968 --> 23:07.887
All the time.
I mean, I've done everything.

23:07.929 --> 23:11.599
Botox, filler,
cheek sculpting, chin shaving--

23:11.641 --> 23:13.435
- No, no,
I cannot take another list.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.270
- [sighs]

23:15.311 --> 23:19.024
My God, that felt so good.
A weight has been lifted!

23:19.065 --> 23:20.191
- So you're gonna stop
doing it?

23:20.233 --> 23:21.860
- No.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.070
The growth is admitting it.
You know what?

23:24.112 --> 23:26.448
I am sick of people like you
judging me

23:26.489 --> 23:28.908
so I feel like I have to do
these things in the shadows.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.827
- No, the only reason you do it
in the first place

23:30.869 --> 23:32.662
is because of societal pressure
on women to--

23:32.704 --> 23:34.289
- Bored!

23:34.330 --> 23:35.832
You know what I think
I'm gonna do next?

23:35.874 --> 23:37.250
They're doing this thing
where they put, like,

23:37.292 --> 23:39.002
a Slinky under your butt.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.255
Leave me alone about it.
- Okay.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.674
But will you just go
to a good place next time?

23:44.716 --> 23:47.927
- Fair, because, um--
[chuckles]

23:47.969 --> 23:49.262
All my threads came out.

23:49.304 --> 23:51.431
- Ew.
- I know. It was gross.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.809
- Overall, a good day, though.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.269
I mean, we still don't have
our love song,

23:56.311 --> 23:58.605
but I'm sure that'll
come to us eventually.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.690
- We found our love song!

24:00.732 --> 24:02.650
- Oh, my God!
[squeals]

24:02.692 --> 24:04.652
- It's about Ashley.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.155
- You've reached
Ashley's Splazz.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.658
* Leave a message
if you love me *

24:10.700 --> 24:14.204
[tender piano music]

24:14.245 --> 24:17.624

without missing you *

24:17.665 --> 24:20.585

24:20.627 --> 24:24.339

and the truth weren't true *

24:24.381 --> 24:26.424
* *

24:26.466 --> 24:30.804
all: * Wanna hear your voice,
but you don't answer anymore *

24:30.845 --> 24:32.889
* *

24:32.931 --> 24:36.142
- * Still, we call you up *

24:36.184 --> 24:39.479
both: * Sometimes to be sure *

24:39.521 --> 24:43.108
- * We hope somewhere
that you can see *

24:43.149 --> 24:46.111
* While you're swimming
in infinity *

24:46.152 --> 24:48.988
- * That life is cruel
and it probably *

24:49.030 --> 24:51.991
all: * Should have been me *

24:52.033 --> 24:55.120
- * I did a lot of cocaine *

24:55.161 --> 24:58.331
all: * So much cocaine *

24:58.373 --> 24:59.708
* At the beep *

"Who's bad at football now?" *

26:51.194 --> 26:55.865
