00:06.927 --> 00:09.470
Xander, Lou, thank you
for putting Emma and me

00:09.470 --> 00:10.721
in charge of
the summer dance.

00:10.721 --> 00:12.933
We are deeply honored.

00:12.933 --> 00:15.476
Ravi, they just pawned it
off on us because
they didn't want to do it.

00:15.476 --> 00:17.638
She's not wrong.

00:17.638 --> 00:19.770
Later, we're going
to give you the honor

00:19.770 --> 00:21.602
of cleaning up

(CHUCKLES)
I'm just kidding, sweetie.

00:25.566 --> 00:27.698
Hey, Xander, remember
our first camp dance?

00:27.698 --> 00:29.910
Yeah. I picked you up
at your cabin,

00:29.910 --> 00:31.782
gave you a corsage
made of wildflowers...

00:31.782 --> 00:33.244
Actually,
it was poison oak.

00:33.244 --> 00:34.535
Remember, you thought
I was blushing,

00:34.535 --> 00:36.457
but it just turned out
to be hives?

00:36.457 --> 00:39.330
(BOTH LAUGHING)
You guys went on a date?
You never told me that.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.541
Eh, we were only nine.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.922
At that age, a date
doesn't mean anything.

00:41.922 --> 00:45.126
Sadly, that can be true
at any age.

00:45.126 --> 00:47.338
Next thing
you'll tell me you went
on a date with Hazel.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.590
No way!

00:49.590 --> 00:52.133
Well, there was that
time she knocked him
over the head,

00:52.133 --> 00:54.175
threw him in a sack,
and made him go canoeing.

00:54.175 --> 00:56.977
Yeah, that was more
of a felony than a date.

Cool beanie, Griff.

01:56.577 --> 01:58.829
Thanks. I got it from
my bunk mate in juvie.

01:58.829 --> 02:00.581
That's nice that
he gave it to you.

02:00.581 --> 02:02.583
Sure... "Gave."

02:06.337 --> 02:08.629
I hate to see Griff go,

02:08.629 --> 02:11.212
but I love
to watch him leave.

02:11.712 --> 02:13.254
I know.

02:13.254 --> 02:15.015
There's something
so deliciously forbidden

02:15.015 --> 02:17.178
about a boy
with a checkered past.

02:19.220 --> 02:20.351
Oh!

02:20.971 --> 02:22.563
He is so amazing.

He has such cool hair...

02:24.475 --> 02:27.608
ZURI: And he looks
so cute in that hat.

02:27.608 --> 02:30.771
I hope he asks me for
every dance tomorrow night.

02:30.771 --> 02:32.193
Not gonna happen

02:32.193 --> 02:33.774
'cause he's gonna
be attracted to me,

02:33.774 --> 02:36.197
like a positive ion
to a negative ion.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.539

like that, nerdbag.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.661
TIFFANY: Oh, it is on!

02:40.661 --> 02:43.704
Bring it! It's going to be

02:43.704 --> 02:45.586
You know it.

02:45.586 --> 02:48.459

03:02.643 --> 03:06.106
So, Emma, what do you think
of my DJ moniker?

03:06.106 --> 03:09.570
"Rockin' Ravi Ross,
the Record Rhombus."

03:09.570 --> 03:10.651
What's a rhombus?

03:10.651 --> 03:12.363
It is a kind of
awkward square.

03:12.363 --> 03:14.575
Well, then that's perfect
for you. (LAUGHS)

03:15.316 --> 03:16.317
Oh!

03:17.197 --> 03:18.869
Quit it,
I'm ticklish!

03:18.869 --> 03:21.912
Yeah, I know. That's why
Grizzly cabin always loses
at touch football.

03:21.912 --> 03:23.584
(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:23.584 --> 03:26.707
You know? I had the most
bizarre dream last night

03:26.707 --> 03:28.038
that Xander and Lou
were a couple.

03:28.038 --> 03:29.750
(CHUCKLES)
Crazy, right?

03:29.750 --> 03:32.713
Well, being best friends
and having a lot in common

03:32.713 --> 03:34.505
is the best foundation
for a relationship.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.757
Or not.

03:38.048 --> 03:40.601
But don't you think Xander
and I have a lot in common?

03:40.601 --> 03:42.513
Sure!

03:42.513 --> 03:45.145
You are both tall,

03:45.145 --> 03:47.768
and you both
breathe oxygen...

03:49.520 --> 03:50.811
Oh!

03:50.811 --> 03:52.443
(SIGHS) Hold up,
you got some glitter.

03:55.566 --> 03:56.947
That's weird.

03:56.947 --> 03:59.069
What, that I focus
on our work

03:59.069 --> 04:01.412
while you only focus
on yourself? (SCOFFS)

04:01.412 --> 04:03.203
I just call that
"par for the course."

04:07.498 --> 04:09.079
Since Ravi and Emma have
the dance covered,

04:09.079 --> 04:10.581
why don't we prep
for the CPR class?

04:10.581 --> 04:11.922
Okay.

04:11.922 --> 04:13.544
Where'd I put that dummy?

04:13.544 --> 04:14.585
(HISSING)

04:15.135 --> 04:16.797
(BOTH SCREAM)

04:16.797 --> 04:19.550
Is that the CPR
dummy's head?
I sure hope so.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.763
Or else we've got
an awkward call to make
to some camper's parents.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.305
(SNARLING)

04:26.887 --> 04:28.939
That leg's missing a foot.

04:28.939 --> 04:30.601
That's going to
be tough coming out.

04:32.393 --> 04:34.655
Okay, let's just review
CPR procedure on each other.

04:34.655 --> 04:35.986
You be in distress.

04:35.986 --> 04:37.698
Fine. Give me a second.

04:37.698 --> 04:39.320
(INHALES DEEPLY)

04:39.320 --> 04:40.821
Help! Help!

04:40.821 --> 04:42.903
I can't swim!

04:42.903 --> 04:45.786
I'm gonna need so much CPR!

04:45.786 --> 04:47.077
(GASPING LOUDLY)

04:50.711 --> 04:51.912
Are you done?

04:51.912 --> 04:54.174
Almost.
(WHEEZING)

04:55.506 --> 04:56.717
Now I'm done.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.011
Okay. All right...
(BLOWING)

05:01.011 --> 05:04.054
Okay, I check for
obstruction of the airway...

05:04.054 --> 05:07.348
Huh! Looks like someone
had fish sticks for lunch.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.599
Then I tilt
the victim's head back,

05:08.599 --> 05:10.100
pinch the nostrils closed,

05:10.100 --> 05:12.353
and exhale into
the victim's mouth.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.564
(INHALES DEEPLY)

05:14.695 --> 05:15.816
Hey!

05:15.816 --> 05:17.898
BOTH: Ow!

05:17.898 --> 05:20.030
What are you doing?
I don't know.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.653
(COUGHS) The last thing
I remember was Xander putting
his fingers in my mouth.

05:22.653 --> 05:25.115
Ew! You two are sick!

05:26.206 --> 05:27.327
Emma!

05:27.658 --> 05:28.829
Emma!

05:30.120 --> 05:31.952
Emma, what is
wrong with you?

05:31.952 --> 05:34.625
Me? What about what you two
were doing in there?

05:34.625 --> 05:36.507
I was just subbing in
for a dummy.

05:36.507 --> 05:37.918
That's what you think I am?

05:39.009 --> 05:40.881
No! I mean,
we weren't kissing.

05:40.881 --> 05:42.803
We were practicing CPR.

05:42.803 --> 05:44.094
Yeah, I had to
practice on Lou

05:44.094 --> 05:45.846
because Kipling
ate the doll.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.928
Okay? I guarantee you,
there's nothing weird
going on here.

05:47.928 --> 05:51.311
All the weird
is right over there.

05:51.311 --> 05:55.105
Well, what about earlier,
when you were touching
Lou's cheek?

05:55.105 --> 05:56.937
Oh! He was just
wiping glitter off.

05:56.937 --> 05:58.649
See? He's still sparkly.

05:58.649 --> 05:59.940
And now
you're holding hands.

06:01.742 --> 06:04.655
Emma, I can't believe
you're being jealous again.

06:04.655 --> 06:05.946
Jealous?

06:05.946 --> 06:07.908
When have I
ever been jealous?

06:07.908 --> 06:10.120
Uh, last week
when you threatened
that girl at the picnic?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.412
Can you blame me?

06:11.412 --> 06:12.753
You came up behind her
and hugged her.

06:12.753 --> 06:13.834
She was choking
on a grape.

06:13.834 --> 06:15.295
I was giving her
the Heimlich.

06:16.757 --> 06:21.672
FYI, it did not go well,
hence the CPR class.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.804
Still, I saw the way
she was looking at Xander.

06:23.804 --> 06:26.767
How could you tell?
Her eyes were rolling
back in her head.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.219
Just forget it.

06:29.219 --> 06:30.641
I can't deal with you
right now.

06:32.182 --> 06:34.975
Emma, how could you think
I would betray you?

06:34.975 --> 06:38.859
You know I live and
breathe our cabin code,
Chucks before Bucks.

06:38.859 --> 06:41.321
Well, excuse me
for making a mistake.

06:41.321 --> 06:42.613
Hey, guys!

06:42.613 --> 06:44.074
Want to go make
friendship bracelets?

06:44.074 --> 06:45.235
BOTH: No!

06:45.235 --> 06:47.488
Okay, maybe anger anklets?

06:54.745 --> 06:57.878
Dude, Zuri and Tiffany
want me.

06:57.878 --> 06:58.999
To...

06:58.999 --> 07:00.751
Leave them alone?

07:00.751 --> 07:02.673
No!

07:02.673 --> 07:05.886
I overheard them fighting
about who gets to dance
with me tomorrow.

07:05.886 --> 07:08.388
They both want
a hunk of Jorge.

07:08.388 --> 07:10.260
(SNICKERS) Really?

07:10.260 --> 07:12.723
I mean, good for you, man.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.394
Does this mean
you'll finally
take a shower?

07:14.394 --> 07:16.016
Why would I do that?

07:16.016 --> 07:17.648
This is workin'.

07:20.981 --> 07:23.694
I cannot believe Xander
and Lou are mad at me.

07:23.694 --> 07:26.156
Can you believe he said
I have a jealousy problem?

07:26.156 --> 07:29.620
Well, there was that time
you went into a rage over

07:29.620 --> 07:31.331
that girl from Salmon Cabin.

07:31.331 --> 07:33.203
Her hands were
all over Xander.

07:33.203 --> 07:36.206
She was six.
He was giving her
a piggy back ride.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.168
Oh, that little vixen
knew what she was doing.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.791
Okay, I hear it now.

07:46.547 --> 07:47.848
Mmm...

07:47.848 --> 07:50.801
Griff could make gutting
a fish look good.

07:50.801 --> 07:52.513
Speaking of looking good,

07:52.513 --> 07:55.015
I'm going to look
really good on Griff's
arm at the dance.

07:55.015 --> 07:57.648
(SCOFFS) Please,
you don't have a chance.

07:57.648 --> 08:00.480
I've been smooth-talking boys
since you were in diapers.

08:01.061 --> 08:02.733
What's up, ladies?

08:02.733 --> 08:04.104
(GIGGLING)

08:07.988 --> 08:09.820
Real smooth, giggles.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.952
So, I hear you've both
been fighting over

08:11.952 --> 08:14.074
who's going to get to dance
with a certain special guy.

08:14.074 --> 08:15.876
Oh, this guy's special,
all right.

08:15.876 --> 08:17.878
He must be
a carbon sample,

08:17.878 --> 08:20.751
because I really want
to "date" him.

08:20.751 --> 08:21.792
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

08:27.007 --> 08:28.929
Ah, science jokes.

08:28.929 --> 08:31.932
Helping girls get guys
since never.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.811
Hey, Xander.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.643
I need to talk to you
about something important.

08:42.643 --> 08:44.024
(SIGHS) Good.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.025
I think we need
to talk, too.

08:47.447 --> 08:48.859
So...

08:51.031 --> 08:52.993
Which pair of shoes
should I wear to the dance?

08:52.993 --> 08:55.205
These will match
what you'll be wearing,

08:55.205 --> 08:56.917
but these are
super expensive,

08:56.917 --> 08:59.209
and will make all
the other girls super sad
they're not wearing them.

08:59.209 --> 09:00.791
Which is what good shoes
are supposed to do.

09:02.252 --> 09:04.755
You came here to talk
to me about shoes?

09:04.755 --> 09:07.968
Yes. I said it was important.

09:07.968 --> 09:11.051
Wait, you don't want to
talk about how you blew up
at me and Lou?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.222
Not really.

09:13.974 --> 09:15.305
It stresses me out.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.097
And stress gives me pimples.

09:17.097 --> 09:18.809
And I'm not going
to the dance with
pimples, duh.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.771
So, let's just put it
behind us.

09:20.771 --> 09:22.102
No!

09:22.102 --> 09:24.564
No! Look, Emma,
your jealousy is bad enough,

09:24.564 --> 09:28.028
but you accused me
of cheating on you
with our best friend.

09:28.028 --> 09:29.860
I don't know
if I can ever get over that.

09:31.652 --> 09:32.903
I don't want
to nitpick,

09:32.903 --> 09:36.196
but that is the exact opposite
of "putting it behind us."

09:37.908 --> 09:38.959
You know what, Emma?

09:38.959 --> 09:41.121
You wear whatever shoes
you want to the dance,

09:41.121 --> 09:42.833
because I'm not going
with you.

09:49.259 --> 09:52.843
Well, now I'm going to
be as sad as the girls
not wearing my shoes.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.102
Oh, yeah!

10:02.102 --> 10:04.725
Welcome to
the Kikiwaka Dance!

10:04.725 --> 10:09.399
I am DJ Rockin' Ravi Ross,
the Record Rhombus.

10:09.399 --> 10:12.282
And next to me
is my sister from
another mister,

10:12.282 --> 10:13.654
Sleazy E.

10:13.654 --> 10:16.657
Sleazy, tell them
how you feel.

10:16.657 --> 10:20.120
Life is an empty void
of infinite nothingness.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.243
You said it, girl!

10:23.243 --> 10:26.506
Now for some tasty jams,
so you may dance and prance,

10:26.506 --> 10:28.458
pop and a'lock!

10:28.458 --> 10:30.050
Oh, yeah!

10:30.050 --> 10:32.092
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

10:35.305 --> 10:37.517
So, what do ya think?

10:37.517 --> 10:39.059
Looking good, J-Dog.

10:39.059 --> 10:41.431
(GAGS) But smelling nasty.

10:41.431 --> 10:45.025
Uh, you reek like
paint thinner and hotdogs.

10:45.025 --> 10:47.858
The paint thinner smell
is my new hair product.

10:47.858 --> 10:50.941
The hotdog is just
my natural musk.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.403
Look, you want to knock
them dead with your charm,

10:53.403 --> 10:54.865
not your smell.

10:54.865 --> 10:56.987
I mean, at least get rid
of the hair stank.

10:56.987 --> 10:59.119
Okay, I'll wash it out.

10:59.119 --> 11:01.872
If they ask,
tell them I had diarrhea.

11:04.544 --> 11:06.546
And he has two girls
after him?

11:07.247 --> 11:08.959
Hey, Griff.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.551
Well, you two sure
look great.

11:11.551 --> 11:14.504
No scratch marks,
no eyes gouged out...

11:15.635 --> 11:17.097
Thanks, Griff.

11:17.097 --> 11:19.970
You give the most
unique compliments.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.472
So which lucky girl
is it going to be?

11:22.472 --> 11:24.855
You want to dance
with me, not her.

11:24.855 --> 11:27.107
She slobbers at night.

11:27.107 --> 11:29.730
(SCOFFS) Only because
of my headgear.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.903
Which I should've
kept to myself.

11:32.903 --> 11:36.156
Wait, you two want to
dance with me?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.698
But what about Jorge?

11:38.698 --> 11:41.822
You want to ask
Jorge to dance?

11:41.822 --> 11:44.454
Okay, this just took
an unexpected turn.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.457
No, I mean,

11:47.457 --> 11:50.961
you're both fighting over
who gets to dance
with Jorge, right?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.293
(BOTH LAUGHING)

11:54.214 --> 11:55.505
I'm serious.

11:55.505 --> 11:57.547
He overheard you two talking
about how much you liked him.

11:58.799 --> 12:00.180
BOTH: Uh-oh.

12:01.551 --> 12:03.683
Well, hello, ladies.

12:03.683 --> 12:06.106
Thanks for keeping them
warm for me.

12:06.106 --> 12:08.018
Jorge, I need to
tell you something.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.150
Not now, brah.

12:10.150 --> 12:12.152
Me and my honeys are
about to sizzle on
the dance floor.

12:12.152 --> 12:12.983
(IMITATES SIZZLING)

12:14.194 --> 12:16.817
Jorge, I'm really sorry,

12:16.817 --> 12:19.159
but you're not the one
we wanted to dance with.

12:19.159 --> 12:22.162
That's right I'm not the one
you wanted to dance with.

12:22.162 --> 12:24.364
(CHUCKLES) Wait...
Wait, what?

12:25.916 --> 12:28.498
It was a big
misunderstanding.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.171
We wanted Griff
to ask us to dance.

12:32.963 --> 12:34.134
Oh.

12:34.714 --> 12:36.006
Jorge...

12:37.137 --> 12:38.258
You okay?

12:39.139 --> 12:41.721
Yeah, bro, I'm great.

12:41.721 --> 12:44.474
I just, uh, need to
be somewhere else.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.439
Oh, wow.

12:49.439 --> 12:51.101
I feel terrible.

12:51.101 --> 12:52.312
Me too.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.104
Wanna dance?

12:56.196 --> 12:58.198
You know,
to soothe the pain.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.032
Women.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.114
They're jealous,

13:04.114 --> 13:07.327
and they'll turn on you
like a jar of mayonnaise
left out in the hot sun.

13:07.327 --> 13:10.080
So stay single,
and stick to mustard.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.716
What did you do,
tell them about that time
you saw Gladys in a bikini?

13:18.218 --> 13:20.260
Wow, Lou.
You look awesome.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.132
(LAUGHS) Thanks.

13:22.132 --> 13:23.844
Last time I wore this
was to Bessie and Clem's
wedding.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.015
Oh, your friends
got married?

13:25.015 --> 13:27.057
No, my cows.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.348
I was the milk maid
of honor.

13:29.689 --> 13:31.641
So, how are you holding up?

13:31.641 --> 13:33.894
Uh, not great.

13:33.894 --> 13:35.986
It just feels so weird
that I'm not here with Emma.

13:35.986 --> 13:38.028
I know. The three of
us should be out on
the dance floor,

13:38.028 --> 13:40.070
shaking our tushies.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.862
Well, we're here,
and we're dressed up.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.113
So wanna dance?

13:43.113 --> 13:44.244
Why not?

13:45.906 --> 13:47.908
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

13:53.213 --> 13:55.125
Can you believe Emma
thought we were into
each other?

13:55.125 --> 13:57.377
I know, right?
It's totally crazy.

13:57.377 --> 13:59.589
I mean, sure, we have, like,
everything in common.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.261
Exactly.

14:01.261 --> 14:03.884
I'm basically you
without mascara.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.845
Can you imagine
if we got married?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.307
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

14:07.307 --> 14:09.890
Our kid would
be an amazing musician
and a great farm hand.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.311
Yeah, she could
play the guitar,

14:11.311 --> 14:13.273
then lasso a cow
with her guitar string.

14:13.273 --> 14:15.145
I think that would slice
the cow's head off.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.316
Yes.

14:16.316 --> 14:18.939
Yes, it would.

14:18.939 --> 14:21.151
But lucky for the cow,
none of that is ever
gonna happen,

14:21.151 --> 14:22.572
because we're just friends.

14:22.572 --> 14:24.284
Yeah, best friends.

14:24.284 --> 14:25.485
Nothing more.

14:28.989 --> 14:31.251
Why are you looking
at me that way?

14:31.251 --> 14:32.872
Why are you looking
at me that way?

14:35.205 --> 14:38.208
OMG, look at
the two of them.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.170
Now they really are
into each other.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.303
You know, if you had not been
so paranoid and jealous

14:43.303 --> 14:45.345
that Lou and Xander
were together before,

14:45.345 --> 14:47.057
they would not be
together now.

14:47.057 --> 14:49.219
(CHUCKLES)
How amusingly ironic.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.400
Head sauce?

15:06.236 --> 15:09.239
Okay, on the count of three,
we stop staring at each other.

15:09.239 --> 15:10.951
Deal?
Deal.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.912
BOTH: One, two, three.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.884
Okay, that was weird.
(LAUGHING)

15:24.884 --> 15:27.257
Yeah, I think I have
more chemistry
with my pet pig.

15:27.257 --> 15:28.808
I think
I should be insulted.

15:28.808 --> 15:31.101
Don't be. He's the
George Clooney of pigs.

15:31.101 --> 15:32.352
Who decides that?

15:32.352 --> 15:34.224
A bunch of really
creepy farmers.

15:37.897 --> 15:39.319
Hey, J-Dog.

15:39.819 --> 15:41.361
You okay?

15:41.361 --> 15:43.403
I can't believe
I was so stupid.

15:43.403 --> 15:46.446
Of course, Zuri and Tiffany
wanted to dance with you.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.908
You're the exciting bad boy.

15:48.908 --> 15:50.910
I guess I'm just not cool.

15:50.910 --> 15:52.332
Are you kidding me?

15:52.332 --> 15:54.874
You're one of
the coolest guys
I've ever met.

15:54.874 --> 15:56.416
Really?

15:56.416 --> 15:58.338
How am I cool?

15:58.338 --> 16:00.340
(INHALING SHARPLY)
I was afraid you
were going to ask that.

16:01.381 --> 16:03.383
Give me a second.

16:03.383 --> 16:05.255
Oh, I got it.

16:06.586 --> 16:09.259
You're funny, and nice.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.432
And you got great hair.

16:12.432 --> 16:13.933
Well, that's true.

16:13.933 --> 16:14.974
What else?

16:16.936 --> 16:18.018
Look...

16:19.559 --> 16:23.483
My point is,
you're a great guy,

16:23.483 --> 16:27.027
and if those girls don't see
that, it's their loss.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.608
You really think so?

16:28.608 --> 16:31.161
Absolutely, man.

16:31.161 --> 16:34.074
And there are a lot of
other cute girls out there,

16:34.074 --> 16:35.615
so go dance with them.

16:35.615 --> 16:38.078
But I embarrassed myself.

16:38.078 --> 16:39.539
Who cares?

16:39.539 --> 16:41.581
Everyone embarrasses
themselves.

16:41.581 --> 16:42.882
Have you met Ravi?

16:44.384 --> 16:47.337
So just go have fun
and be yourself.

16:47.337 --> 16:49.469
So I can go put
my hair gel back in?

16:49.469 --> 16:51.131
No! Throw that away.

16:51.131 --> 16:52.392
Better yet, bury it.

16:56.476 --> 16:58.398
Hey, Emma.

16:58.398 --> 17:00.230
How're you doing?

17:00.230 --> 17:02.772
Ravi, you were
totally right.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.524
I get that a lot.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.316
What was I right about,
specifically?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.239
That I'm a jealous person.

17:09.239 --> 17:11.361
And I don't want to be
that way anymore.

17:11.361 --> 17:15.325
It's caused me to ruin
the two most important
relationships in my life.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.917
So, now I know
I am number three, tops.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.331
Emma...

17:21.331 --> 17:24.214
You know what you need to
do to make things better.

17:24.214 --> 17:27.427
Well, usually a total body
seaweed wrap does the trick,

17:27.427 --> 17:29.339
but there isn't
a decent spa for miles.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.472
No! (CHUCKLES)

17:32.472 --> 17:35.555
I meant Lou and Xander
are your best friends.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.727
If you want to prove
that you have changed,

17:37.727 --> 17:40.480
put your own feelings aside
and be supportive of them.

17:41.481 --> 17:43.523
You're right, Ravi.

17:43.523 --> 17:45.525
And I'm sorry
for pouring cocktail
sauce on you.

17:45.525 --> 17:48.278
Oh, no problem,
the horseradish keeps
away the mosquitos.

17:51.491 --> 17:53.403
Guys, I need
to talk to you.

17:53.403 --> 17:55.655
Look, Emma...
Please, let me finish.

17:55.655 --> 17:58.578
I'm sorry I was so jealous
and didn't trust you two.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.830
You guys are my best friends,
and you didn't deserve that.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.502
Emma...
Let me finish.

18:02.502 --> 18:04.704
I completely understand
if you don't forgive me.

18:04.704 --> 18:08.087
But that's what
we wanted to talk...
Let me finish!

18:08.087 --> 18:10.800
I saw the way you were
looking at each other
while you were dancing,

18:10.800 --> 18:14.514
and one day, I think
you'll make a great couple.

18:14.514 --> 18:16.476
Emma...
Let me finish!

18:17.427 --> 18:18.928
Okay, I'm finished.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.722
Xander and I
are just friends.

18:22.722 --> 18:24.144
Best friends.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.855
Always have been,
always will be.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.527
But that's all we are.

18:27.527 --> 18:28.688
Oh, thank goodness.

18:28.688 --> 18:30.990
So we're all good?

18:30.990 --> 18:33.323
Of course!
Bring it in, bestie.

18:37.577 --> 18:39.829
So, Emma?

18:39.829 --> 18:41.661
Would you like to go
to the dance with me?

18:41.661 --> 18:44.204
I can pick you up,
like, right now.

18:45.205 --> 18:46.376
I'd love to.

18:52.051 --> 18:55.305
Xander, do you
really forgive me?

18:57.427 --> 18:59.018
Does this answer
your question?

19:04.934 --> 19:06.606
I don't know.

19:06.606 --> 19:08.188
Maybe you better
answer it again.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.322
Hey, want to dance,
Record Rhomboid?

19:12.322 --> 19:14.864
Oh, uh... Actually,
I go by Rhombus,

19:14.864 --> 19:17.657
which is technically
different from
a rhomboid in that...

19:17.657 --> 19:19.909
Do you want to
dance or not, nerd?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.451
Let us boogie.
(CHUCKLES)

19:26.916 --> 19:30.380
Yo, DJ Griffindor
in the house!

19:30.380 --> 19:31.501
(ALL CHEERING)

19:34.924 --> 19:38.137
I want to welcome to
the floor the dopest guy
in the camp.

19:38.137 --> 19:41.301
Give it up for J-Dog!

19:41.301 --> 19:42.892
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

20:12.462 --> 20:13.543
(ALL CHEERING)

20:15.255 --> 20:18.177
Wow, Jorge can
actually dance.

20:18.177 --> 20:21.140
Which is amazing,
because he can barely walk.

20:23.513 --> 20:27.347
Hey, those girls are
playing in our toy box.

20:28.648 --> 20:29.899
Beat it, ladies.

20:29.899 --> 20:31.901
Yeah, we got dibs
on the curls.

20:41.281 --> 20:44.243
You know, Ravi,
you did a great job
organizing the dance.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.786
Thank you, but I cannot
take all the credit.

20:46.786 --> 20:48.578
Emma helped with...

20:48.578 --> 20:50.710
I mean, she did hang the...

20:50.710 --> 20:53.543
Okay, I will take
all the credit.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.675
Ravi, I'm really sorry
I let you down.

20:55.675 --> 20:57.677
But I can help now.

20:57.677 --> 20:59.258
Thank you
for offering, Emma.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.680
Could you pick up
the garbage?

21:00.680 --> 21:03.182
Ew, no, gross!

21:03.182 --> 21:05.975
By help out,
I meant give the party
four stars online.

21:05.975 --> 21:07.807
(SIGHS) Par for the course.

21:10.690 --> 21:13.773
Xander, I want you to know
that from now on,

21:13.773 --> 21:16.696
I promise I will not be
a jealous girlfriend.

21:16.696 --> 21:18.568
That's awesome, Emma.
Thank you.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.402
Hey!

21:22.402 --> 21:23.613
You eye my man again,

21:23.613 --> 21:24.704
and the last thing
you'll be looking at

21:24.704 --> 21:26.536
is the bottom of
a shallow grave!

21:27.957 --> 21:31.120
(SIGHS) Not jealous,
starting now.
