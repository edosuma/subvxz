00:02.100 --> 00:05.000
        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:07.500 --> 00:09.200
Oh, Lilith.                     

00:09.300 --> 00:10.800
  Boy, am I happy to see you.   

00:10.900 --> 00:12.400
      And I, as ever, you.      

00:12.400 --> 00:14.100
You know, I was                 
cleanin' out my garage,         

00:14.200 --> 00:16.700
and I was gonna toss            
a whole bunch of old toys       

00:16.800 --> 00:18.400
into the Dumpster,              
and then I thought,             

00:18.500 --> 00:20.600
"Oh, heck, maybe                
the Crane kid would like 'em."  

00:20.700 --> 00:22.400
                     Oh, goodie!

00:22.500 --> 00:23.700
                    War toys.   

00:23.700 --> 00:25.500
Yeah.                           

00:25.600 --> 00:27.000
Get a load of these, huh?       

00:27.000 --> 00:28.400
                    Ah.         

00:28.400 --> 00:30.200
                      Little tin
            Confederate soldiers

00:30.300 --> 00:32.100
                 so my child can
                    have the fun

00:32.100 --> 00:35.700
     of reliving the carnage and
         agony of the Civil War.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.800
    You bet.                    

00:36.900 --> 00:39.600
My Gino once did a battle       
of Gettysburg using these       

00:39.600 --> 00:41.900
and a can of tomato             
bisque soup.                    

00:41.900 --> 00:43.100
                    Oh!         

00:43.200 --> 00:44.500
                Here's a cute   
                little dolly.   

00:44.600 --> 00:45.700
        Yeah.                   

00:45.800 --> 00:48.100
If you run her along            
the bar, she screams,           

00:48.100 --> 00:50.700
and sparks fly out              
of her eyes.                    

00:50.800 --> 00:52.700
            Carla, these toys   
              are inappropriate.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.200
I fear that a child who spent   
      his time playing with them

00:56.300 --> 00:57.600
        would be in grave danger

00:57.700 --> 01:00.200
            of developing severe
          personality disorders,

01:00.300 --> 01:02.500
              possibly bordering
            on the psychotic.   

01:02.500 --> 01:03.500
        Wow! Spark Head!        

01:03.600 --> 01:06.400
             God, I used to love
          this when I was a kid!

01:06.400 --> 01:09.300
              Hey, guess who Sid
             and Gladys ran into
                  the other day!

01:09.300 --> 01:10.400
            Hank and Marilyn!   

01:10.500 --> 01:12.200
             (imitates squeaking
                and thudding)   

01:12.300 --> 01:14.100
                     Through the
                windshield! Aah!

01:14.200 --> 01:16.300
 Aah! Skidding on the pavement! 

01:16.400 --> 01:19.000
            (laughs)            

01:19.100 --> 01:20.500
                            See?

01:20.600 --> 01:23.100
             Do I want my son to
              grow up like that?

01:25.400 --> 01:27.200

01:28.800 --> 01:31.200

             Thanks for dropping
                  me off, honey.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.100
        Sure.                   
                Yeah.           

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
                  Oh, I tell you
            guys-- man, phew!   

02:16.000 --> 02:18.800
        Martha's Vineyard is the
        sweetest place on Earth.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.000
Bye, Sam.                       

02:20.100 --> 02:21.900
                    Bye, Martha.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.800
            (laughs)            

02:26.900 --> 02:29.900
    Hey, let me buy you guys    
    a round here, huh?          

02:30.000 --> 02:30.800
        Hey, all right.         
    Thank you, Sammy.           

02:30.800 --> 02:32.400
                    You are in a
                 good mood, huh?

02:32.500 --> 02:35.100
    Well, why not? I woke up    
 on the right side of her bed.  

02:35.100 --> 02:36.400
                        You dog!

02:38.600 --> 02:40.300
    I know something that'll    
make you feel even better.      

02:40.300 --> 02:41.500
              Yeah? What's that?

02:41.600 --> 02:43.500
Guess who's taking over         
Melville's today.               
                        Me?     

02:43.500 --> 02:44.800
                    Wow!        

02:44.800 --> 02:46.600
John Allen Hill...              
                        Hmm.    

02:46.700 --> 02:48.500
...Manhattan's foremost         
restaurateur.                   

02:48.700 --> 02:50.100
              And guess who made
                  it all happen.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.300
Me? Wow!                        

02:51.400 --> 02:52.600
REBECCA:                        
No.                             

02:52.700 --> 02:54.600
            Me. I was talking   
                    to Rob...   
Wait, wait, wait.               

02:54.600 --> 02:56.800
Does this story have anything   
to do with me?                  

02:56.800 --> 02:58.000
                        Yes.    
            Wow!                

02:59.900 --> 03:01.500
Go on, go on, go on.            

03:01.600 --> 03:04.000
             When Mr. Hill makes
            Melville's the toast
          of Boston's nightlife,

03:04.100 --> 03:06.300
        our little bar will ride
            right along with it.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.800
                         And all
                  because of me.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.800
Wow!                            
              Wow!              
                            Wow!

03:09.800 --> 03:13.700
     Guys, check this out.      

03:13.800 --> 03:15.400
     Kelly sent me pictures     
        of herself              

03:15.500 --> 03:17.600
    all the way from Paris.     

03:17.700 --> 03:19.800
        Ah.                     
                  Oh.           

03:19.900 --> 03:21.200
                    Hmm. This   
                  one's a cutie.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.600
        Ooh! Yeah.              

03:22.700 --> 03:25.800
Oh, yeah, that's her on her bed 
in the... in the convent.       

03:25.800 --> 03:27.100
                        FRASIER:
                    Looking, uh,

03:27.200 --> 03:28.600
        rather fetching         

03:28.700 --> 03:32.700
in an oversized T-shirt reading,
     <i>"Je suis avec Stupide."</i>    

03:32.700 --> 03:34.000
            (laughs)            

03:34.100 --> 03:35.800
            (ribald laughter)   

03:35.900 --> 03:37.800
                    Ooh, la, la.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.000
     So, who do you suppose took
          those snapshots, Wood?

03:40.100 --> 03:41.500
Oh, probably                    
her roommate, Cindy Ann.        

03:41.600 --> 03:42.700
                            Hmm.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.000
     Well, I-I don't know,      
             Woody.             

03:44.100 --> 03:45.600
        There's a thumb         
        in this picture.        

03:45.600 --> 03:47.800
Either it's a man's thumb,      
      or little Cindy Ann       

03:47.900 --> 03:51.800
     could use a big bottle     
     of Nair for Christmas.     

03:53.100 --> 03:54.700
I can't believe it.             

03:54.800 --> 03:56.700
This <i>is</i> a man's thumb.          

03:56.800 --> 03:59.200
She's having some hairy         
French guy                      

03:59.300 --> 04:02.200
take sexy pictures              
of her!                         

04:02.300 --> 04:04.600
All right, well,                
two can play at this game.      

04:04.700 --> 04:07.300
I'm gonna have some hairy       
French guy take pictures of me. 

04:14.200 --> 04:15.300
         (door closes)          

04:15.300 --> 04:17.800
I'm John Hill,                  
your new upstairs neighbor.     

04:17.899 --> 04:19.300
            Oh, hi.             

04:19.300 --> 04:21.399
And you must be                 
Sam Malone.                     

04:21.500 --> 04:22.400
     Yeah. How'd you know?      

04:22.600 --> 04:24.600
My hatcheck girl                
described your hair.            

04:25.400 --> 04:27.300
She didn't do it justice.       

04:27.400 --> 04:29.700
        Ah. Well,               
     it's kind of a hobby.      

04:29.800 --> 04:32.400
The joy it must bring you.      

04:34.700 --> 04:35.800
Well, Mr. Malone,               

04:35.900 --> 04:37.500
since we're going               
to be neighbors,                

04:37.600 --> 04:39.800
I brought a little gift         
for your tavern.                

04:39.800 --> 04:41.500
            Oh! Look at that.   
                 Hey, all right.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.900
              It's a welcome mat
              with a duck on it.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.300
                Look at that.   

04:45.400 --> 04:48.500
        Well, we've never really
        used a-a doormat before.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.800
                    Well, not   
                counting Clavin.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.600
      Do you, uh... Do you think
         this kind of thing goes

04:54.700 --> 04:56.200
                in a sports bar?

04:56.200 --> 04:57.500
    Oh...                       
                          WOODY:
                        Well,   

04:57.500 --> 04:59.500
        back in Hanover, duck   
        hunting is considered   

04:59.600 --> 05:01.400
                      one of the
             manliest of sports.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.700
                We used to do it
                all the time.   

05:03.700 --> 05:05.300
        You-You actually        
    shot ducks, Woody?          

05:05.400 --> 05:06.500
                         Oh, no.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.600
                  It was just an
             excuse for the guys

05:08.700 --> 05:10.400
                 to get together
             and drink hot cocoa

05:10.500 --> 05:14.100
        and blow those little   
         quacker dealies, right?

05:14.200 --> 05:15.500
                    I had the   
                    best one.   

05:15.600 --> 05:18.200
              I made it out of a
            Good and Plenty box.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.100
        He's cute.              

05:22.200 --> 05:25.200
Does he come with               
his own dueling banjo?          

05:28.800 --> 05:30.700
Well, Mr. Malone,               

05:30.800 --> 05:32.500
uh, please make sure            
your patrons                    

05:32.600 --> 05:35.500
use this mat before             
tracking dirt up to Melville's. 

05:35.600 --> 05:37.400
                         Oh, uh,

05:37.400 --> 05:38.600
      John, you know, I...      

05:38.700 --> 05:40.700
Listen, I really don't think so.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.100
              Oh.               

05:42.200 --> 05:43.800
          Well, fine.           

05:43.900 --> 05:46.600
    Uh, oh, by the way I...     

05:46.700 --> 05:49.100
I think this will               
amuse you, Sam.                 

05:49.100 --> 05:50.700
In looking                      
at the property map             

05:50.800 --> 05:53.500
that came                       
with my title deed,             

05:53.700 --> 05:55.600
it appears that the area        
beyond that hallway             

05:55.700 --> 05:57.900
actually belongs to me.         

05:57.900 --> 05:58.800
    Oh, no, no, John.           

05:58.900 --> 06:00.300
         That's, uh...          
     that's the pool room,      

06:00.400 --> 06:01.600
  and those are our bathrooms.  

06:01.700 --> 06:03.000
No, no, no.                     
Look here.                      

06:03.100 --> 06:04.300
You see?                        

06:04.300 --> 06:07.400
Apparently, it was Melville's   
old storage basement.           

06:07.500 --> 06:08.700
                 Uh-huh, uh-huh.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.100
Don't.... Don't                 
get alarmed.                    

06:10.100 --> 06:11.900
I have no designs on them.      

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I just mentioned it, because    
I thought it was amusing.       

06:16.100 --> 06:17.000
                 (laughs weakly)

06:17.000 --> 06:18.800
                That's-That's   
                     very funny.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.700
                        Um...   

06:21.800 --> 06:24.600
                 so, do we still
                  get to use it?

06:24.600 --> 06:25.700
Of course! We're neighbors.     

06:25.800 --> 06:27.700
Neighbors help each other.      

06:27.700 --> 06:29.300
             Yeah, well, of c...
        Yeah, of course they do.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.100
        Of course they... You   
            know, I got an idea.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.300
    Why don't you let me help   
        you put this duck mat   

06:33.300 --> 06:35.000
            right down at the   
             foot of the stairs?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.500
  Well, that's very thoughtful  
          of you, Sam.          

06:36.600 --> 06:37.700
                             Oh.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.600
Oh, um,                         
one other thing.                

06:40.700 --> 06:44.100
Our, uh, garbage area seems     
to be strewn with beer cans     

06:44.200 --> 06:47.500
that appear to have been crushed
against someone's forehead.     

06:47.600 --> 06:48.700
SAM:                            
Oh...                           

06:48.700 --> 06:50.000
                    I warned you
                     about that.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.400
Hey, I get crazy!               

06:53.400 --> 06:55.500
            Don't-Don't... Don't
        worry about it, John.   

06:55.600 --> 06:58.100
        I'll, uh... I'll take   
        care of that right away.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.800
Also, your red Corvette seems   
to be parked in my space.       

07:00.900 --> 07:02.300
                         Oh, no.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.200
        Now-Now, John, I've-I've
    always parked in that space.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.500
Not any longer.                 

07:06.600 --> 07:08.000
                    Uh, fine.   
                  All-All right.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.200
            Uh, I'll move it.   

07:09.300 --> 07:10.700
Of course you will.             

07:15.700 --> 07:17.900
         You know, I...         

07:17.900 --> 07:20.500
          I don't know          
  if I like this guy so much.   

07:20.600 --> 07:22.100
He seems kind of snooty.        

07:22.100 --> 07:23.500
                        He's not
                    snooty, Sam.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.000
             He's sophisticated.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.800
  I think this bar could benefit
         from his kind of class.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.500
Oh, come on. Cheers is          
classy enough the way it is.    

07:30.500 --> 07:32.700
     (party horns tooting)      

07:38.600 --> 07:42.900
              Have you ever seen
                 so many Yuppies
                with gold cards?

07:44.700 --> 07:46.500
John Allen Hill                 
worked his magic,               

07:46.500 --> 07:48.200
and we reap                     
the benefits.                   

07:48.300 --> 07:49.700
                    I love these
                charge slips.   

07:49.800 --> 07:51.500
                Look at here.   

07:51.600 --> 07:54.000
                 They put down a
                 five for a tip.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.600
              Now, all I have to
            do is stick a one   
            in front of it...   

08:00.200 --> 08:02.000
                ...and I got 15!

08:02.100 --> 08:03.900
Uh, oh, all right, Normie,      
you beat me fair and square,    

08:03.900 --> 08:05.600
so, uh, all right,              
let me buy you a beer.          

08:05.600 --> 08:06.800
                    Yeah.       

08:22.700 --> 08:26.600
                Um... excuse me,
                    I was, uh...

08:26.700 --> 08:28.700
            I was sitting, uh...
                  sitting there?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.300
Oh, there was no one here       
        when we came in.        

08:31.400 --> 08:33.299
                     No, I mean,
                      yesterday.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.700
                          And...

08:36.799 --> 08:41.100
            I mean, really since
        the Ford administration.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.299
We're just waiting              
for our table up in Melville's. 

08:43.299 --> 08:44.700
                 So you'll move?

08:44.700 --> 08:46.700
Look, there's lots              
of other stools.                

08:47.800 --> 08:50.000
            Um...               

08:50.100 --> 08:52.300
            (chuckles slightly):
                        Um...   

08:53.300 --> 08:54.400
                 (clears throat)

08:54.500 --> 08:56.400
                 Look, uh, um...

08:56.500 --> 08:58.100
                     Sounds kind
                     of silly...

08:58.100 --> 09:00.100
                      I'm, uh...
                    I'm Norm.   

09:04.600 --> 09:06.300
I'm Jeffrey,                    
and this is Hillary.            

09:06.300 --> 09:07.600
    Nice to meet you.           

09:07.600 --> 09:09.300
     What do you do, Norm?      

09:09.400 --> 09:11.500
                    I sit there.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.500
        (clears throat)         

09:13.500 --> 09:16.300
Well, it's nice                 
meeting you.                    

09:16.400 --> 09:18.800
                  (clears throat
                     repeatedly)

09:20.700 --> 09:22.500
      Look, uh, this is...      
        this is...              

09:22.600 --> 09:24.100
                 (clears throat)

09:24.100 --> 09:25.900
      Yeah. We're runnin'       
    out of time here.           

09:26.000 --> 09:27.300
    He's-He's already           
        two stages              

09:27.300 --> 09:28.800
        beyond anything         
    I've seen before,           

09:28.900 --> 09:31.200
          so I-I think          
you'd better give him the stool.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.100
            I'm-I'm sorry.      
            We're sitting here. 

09:33.100 --> 09:34.200
                      (grunting)

09:34.300 --> 09:35.500
                      (thudding)

09:35.600 --> 09:36.800
      Norm? Norm! Norm...!      

09:36.900 --> 09:39.800
  (overlapping crowd chatter)   

09:50.600 --> 09:52.800
Uh, what's all                  
the commotion about?            

09:52.900 --> 09:54.100
                      Who cares?

09:54.100 --> 09:56.200
            Set 'em up, Wood.   

09:56.300 --> 09:57.500
        (phone ringing)         

09:57.600 --> 10:00.400
        (clears throat)         

10:00.500 --> 10:01.800
            Cheers.             

10:01.900 --> 10:03.900
    Uh, okay, just a second.    

10:04.000 --> 10:06.700
Armstrong, party of four,       
      your table is ready.      

10:06.800 --> 10:08.100
Uh, have our drinks             
sent upstairs.                  

10:08.100 --> 10:09.600
We'll pay for them              
up there.                       

10:09.600 --> 10:11.300
Excuse me?                      

10:11.400 --> 10:13.500
      Young man, could you      
  call upstairs and tell them   

10:13.600 --> 10:15.400
    that we're waiting          
    down in the lounge          

10:15.500 --> 10:16.900
    until <i>our</i> table             
    is ready?                   

10:17.000 --> 10:18.100
                    Sure.       
No, Woody.                      
Woody, no.                      

10:18.200 --> 10:20.200
This is not...                  
This is not Melville's lounge.  

10:20.300 --> 10:22.600
Uh, I got to go talk            
to this Hill guy.               

10:22.700 --> 10:24.500
        This is getting         
    out of hand here.           

10:24.600 --> 10:25.900
        This is my bar.         

10:25.900 --> 10:29.700
      It's not his stupid       
         yuppie lounge!         

10:29.700 --> 10:31.300
                I think Sam's   
                    overreacting

10:31.400 --> 10:33.200
                     just a bit,
                      don't you?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.800
          Ciao, gang!           

10:35.900 --> 10:37.400
             CROWD:             
             Randy!             

10:42.200 --> 10:45.700
Times they are                  
a-changin', Mr. P.              

10:45.800 --> 10:47.000
Hey, Norm!                      
Norm, Norm, Norm!               

10:47.100 --> 10:49.200
    Give me your coat           
    and tie, will you?          

10:49.300 --> 10:51.400
          Forgot about          
    their stupid dress code.    

10:53.100 --> 10:55.200
            Woody,              

10:55.300 --> 10:58.600
you sent up a party of eight    
without calling ahead.          

10:58.700 --> 11:01.400
              Where is my brain?

11:01.400 --> 11:02.100
                        Oh, man!

11:02.300 --> 11:03.400
     This is going too far.     

11:03.500 --> 11:05.000
Sam! Sam! Sam,                  
stop it. Relax.                 

11:05.000 --> 11:07.600
Listen, don't let your anger    
get the better of you.          

11:07.600 --> 11:09.100
     That's the worst thing     
        you can do              

11:09.200 --> 11:10.500
                in a business   
                      situation.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.800
Well, maybe                     
you're right.                   

11:11.900 --> 11:13.200
I don't know.                   
It just...                      

11:13.300 --> 11:16.400
You know, it seems to me like   
he's turning our bar into...    

11:16.500 --> 11:19.000
well, into something            
Diane would have liked.         

11:21.100 --> 11:22.300
                 All right, Sam.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.800
                You hold him,   
                I'll hit him.   

11:23.900 --> 11:25.200
            No, no.             

11:29.500 --> 11:30.600
                     You-You-You
                     were right.
                    Thanks, man.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.400
              You were right the
             first time. Listen,

11:32.500 --> 11:34.400
        I'll just go...         
      talk to him... here.      

11:34.500 --> 11:36.200
     Say, Mr. Hill... John!     

11:36.300 --> 11:38.500
                  Could I have a
        little chat with you?   

11:38.600 --> 11:40.500
Oh, certainly, Mr. Malone.      

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
                    John, I'm...

11:42.600 --> 11:44.500
            I'm feeling a little
                uncomfortable   

11:44.600 --> 11:47.800
             with you delegating
            new responsibilities

11:47.900 --> 11:49.900
                to <i>my</i> employees.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.200
I understand completely.        

11:52.300 --> 11:53.600
        Oh, good, so it'll stop.

11:53.700 --> 11:54.900
    No...                       

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I think I deserve               
a little leeway.                

11:57.100 --> 11:59.500
After all, I am allowing you    
to use that poolroom            

11:59.500 --> 12:01.400
as well as both washrooms.      

12:01.500 --> 12:02.600
            Well, no, no, now   
                  wait a second.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.500
          I could just as easily
    say that I'm allowing you   

12:04.600 --> 12:06.200
              and your customers
            to use my stairs.   

12:06.200 --> 12:09.400
I mean, look, there go two of   
    your customers up my stairs.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.000
Yes, and there go two of your   
customers into my washroom.     

12:12.100 --> 12:14.100
      Yeah, well, look, there go
    three more of your customers

12:14.100 --> 12:16.600
              up my stairs.     

12:16.700 --> 12:19.600
Sam, I'm sensing                
hostility here,                 

12:19.600 --> 12:22.400
and, frankly, it hurts me.      

12:22.400 --> 12:25.000
I mean, especially              

12:25.100 --> 12:27.200
since I came down               
to do you a favor.              

12:27.300 --> 12:29.000
        Oh. Uh, well, I'm sorry.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.500
                Uh, what's that?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.400
I wanted to give you            
the number of the impound lot   

12:32.400 --> 12:34.300
where your automobile           
has been towed.                 

12:34.300 --> 12:35.900
                 What?          

12:35.900 --> 12:37.200
Well, you parked                
in my space again,              

12:37.300 --> 12:39.500
and I had to have it            
taken away.                     

12:39.600 --> 12:41.500
             You towed my Vette?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
            FRASIER:            
             Sam...             

12:43.700 --> 12:45.800
                         Sam... 

12:45.900 --> 12:49.200
He towed my Vette.              

12:50.500 --> 12:52.300
    Well... all right.          

12:52.300 --> 12:54.400
     I'm just... I'm afraid     
I'm gonna have to ask you       

12:54.500 --> 12:58.200
    and your customers          
  to no longer use my stairs.   

12:58.200 --> 13:00.000
        Don't you think         
    that's a little drastic?    

13:00.000 --> 13:01.700
          No, I don't.          
    I think it's quite fair.    

13:01.800 --> 13:03.600
     I mean, it's not like      
  I'm scratching their chrome   

13:03.700 --> 13:06.900
    with a giant metal hook.    

13:08.900 --> 13:10.300
        Very well.              

13:10.400 --> 13:13.300
Everyone, may I have            
your attention?                 

13:13.400 --> 13:16.700
Melville's patrons              
are no longer welcome here.     

13:16.700 --> 13:18.100
    Would you please join me    
            upstairs            

13:18.200 --> 13:20.400
 for a complimentary cocktail?  

13:21.700 --> 13:23.300
SAM:                            
No, whoa, whoa.                 

13:23.400 --> 13:24.500
         Not you, Norm.         

13:26.600 --> 13:29.000
Carla! Carla, bring me one down!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.200
Hey, Carla,                     
get-get out of line.            

13:34.100 --> 13:37.400
  Well, I think I handled that  
          quite well.           

13:37.500 --> 13:39.800
 Nobody messes with Sam Malone, 

13:39.800 --> 13:44.100
least of all some hairless      
    king of the snobs.          

13:44.200 --> 13:46.500
    Wow, that was a real shot   
     at you from out of nowhere,

13:46.600 --> 13:47.800
                 huh, Dr. Crane?

13:56.200 --> 13:57.900
          There we go.          

13:58.000 --> 14:00.800
Well, congratulations,          
Sammy.                          

14:00.900 --> 14:03.400
     It's been a whole week     
 since you gave Hill the boot,  

14:03.500 --> 14:05.400
and he hasn't retaliated at all.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.700
                Oh, yeah, I know
                 guys like that.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.200
        They're all the same.   

14:09.200 --> 14:11.800
                You know, you   
            call their bluff,   

14:11.900 --> 14:14.000
pretty soon they crumble.       

14:14.100 --> 14:15.700
             (thud)             

14:26.700 --> 14:28.300
Can you believe                 
the nerve of that guy           

14:28.400 --> 14:30.600
  putting up a wall like this?  

14:30.700 --> 14:32.900
          (shouting):           
  ...you know the Constitution  
 guarantees us certain rights,  

14:32.900 --> 14:34.600
     among those the right      
     to go to the bathroom      

14:34.600 --> 14:36.100
  and the right to play pool!   

14:36.100 --> 14:37.400
  Way to tell them off, Sammy.  

14:37.500 --> 14:38.700
Actually they wouldn't let me in

14:38.700 --> 14:39.900
    'cause I wasn't wearing     
        a jacket,               

14:39.900 --> 14:42.300
      but he can hear me!       

14:42.300 --> 14:44.600
Sam, calm down.                 

14:44.700 --> 14:45.600
      I'm calm. I'm calm.       

14:45.700 --> 14:47.900
            I mean,             
 just according to his lawyer,  

14:48.000 --> 14:50.500
 that horse's ass is not going  
  to take down that brick wall  

14:50.500 --> 14:52.900
        until I pay rent        
        on the poolroom.        

14:53.000 --> 14:56.200
          (laughing):           
  Ooh, ooh... look what I did.  

14:56.300 --> 14:58.700
 I stole all his dinner mints.  

14:58.700 --> 15:00.600
    I know, I know, I know.     

15:00.700 --> 15:02.100
I shouldn't have done it.       
Yes.                            

15:02.200 --> 15:03.600
    I just let him get to me    
         just a touch.          

15:03.700 --> 15:06.500
     It won't happen again,     
         swear to God.          

15:06.600 --> 15:10.200
Ten bucks says he goes          
ballistic by midnight.          

15:10.300 --> 15:12.500
 I've got ten that says 11:00.  

15:12.500 --> 15:14.700
Well, uh, I'll take 9:30.       

15:14.800 --> 15:15.800
Hey, Fras, you want in?         

15:15.900 --> 15:17.300
Well, I don't think             
that would be fair.             

15:17.400 --> 15:19.400
I mean, I am                    
a professional psychiatrist.    

15:19.500 --> 15:21.500
  Then again, it might give me  
        the edge I need.        

15:21.600 --> 15:26.100
         I say by 8:15          
  he'll be spitting up blood.   

15:30.300 --> 15:31.900
        Dr. Crane,              

15:32.000 --> 15:33.800
I need your help.               

15:33.900 --> 15:35.900
 I've been walking the streets, 

15:36.000 --> 15:37.600
      pulling out my hair,      

15:37.700 --> 15:41.300
bumping into things,            
talking to myself.              

15:41.400 --> 15:44.700
          So, what's new, Woody?

15:44.700 --> 15:46.200
Well, it's Kelly.               

15:46.300 --> 15:48.100
I can't stop                    
thinking about her              

15:48.100 --> 15:51.900
and-and that man                
with the thumb.                 

15:52.000 --> 15:53.500
Oh, Woody.                      

15:53.600 --> 15:56.700
You've created this whole       
scenario based on what?         

15:56.800 --> 15:58.800
    A snapshot of an innocent   
              girl in a T-shirt.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.100
    I mean, look, if you want   
    to straighten things out,   

16:00.200 --> 16:03.100
why don't you just call her     
and talk to her?                

16:04.000 --> 16:06.400
Yeah, maybe you're right.       

16:06.400 --> 16:08.600
I mean, maybe                   
if I just talk to her,          

16:08.700 --> 16:10.500
we could clear                  
this whole thing up.            

16:10.600 --> 16:13.100
      But, so help me God       
if a man with a thumb answers...

16:15.600 --> 16:17.100
            Hold on.            

16:17.200 --> 16:19.200
 It's him. It's the thumb guy.  

16:19.300 --> 16:20.900
 And you know what that pervert 
          said to me?           

16:21.000 --> 16:22.900
            "Allo."             
What does that mean in English? 

16:23.000 --> 16:24.800
         Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.700
          No, I took some French
                 in high school.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.200
            I think "allo..."   
             "allo" means, um...

16:29.300 --> 16:30.900
                  "I've got your
        girlfriend in my arms   

16:31.000 --> 16:34.800
and, uh, soon we'll be naked,   
            you stupid cuckold."

16:37.200 --> 16:38.600
That's-that's funny, Norm,      
because I thought it meant, uh, 

16:38.600 --> 16:40.700
"I've got your girlfriend       
in my arms                      

16:40.800 --> 16:43.500
and we're already naked,        
you stupid cuckold."            

16:43.600 --> 16:44.900
                        FRASIER:
             Oh, for God's sake.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.100
  Stop hectoring the poor lad.  

16:47.100 --> 16:48.300
          Woody, it simply means

16:48.400 --> 16:52.000
that "I enjoyed                 
your girlfriend."               

16:52.000 --> 16:54.300
        (laughing)              

16:59.200 --> 17:01.800
All right, listen, Monsieur     
Thumb, you think you got...     

17:01.900 --> 17:03.400
    No, no, no, Woody, Woody,   
Woody, Woody, Woody, stop, stop.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.500
            We were just joking.
        Here let me talk to him.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.500
              <i>Bonjour, Monsieur.</i>

17:07.599 --> 17:09.300
 Eh, mm-hmm,                    
 <i>je suis un ami de Woody.</i>       

17:09.300 --> 17:10.800
 <i>Un petit problème--</i>            

17:10.900 --> 17:13.800
 <i>ma question est</i>                
 <i>le photographe de Kelly.</i>       

17:13.800 --> 17:15.000
    Uh-huh.                     

17:15.099 --> 17:16.500
    (laughing)                  

17:16.599 --> 17:18.200
     <i>Non. Non.</i>                  

17:18.200 --> 17:20.900
              <i>C'est marveilleux.</i>

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
     <i>Merci.</i>                     

17:22.099 --> 17:23.300
    Oh, Woody.                  

17:23.400 --> 17:26.700
It seems that there's a...      
a Monsignor, uh, Pilot,         

17:26.800 --> 17:29.800
a very elderly French cleric,   
who was the one                 

17:29.900 --> 17:31.200
that took the photograph        
of your beloved.                

17:31.300 --> 17:33.100
    Oh, well.                   

17:33.100 --> 17:34.800
Thank you, Dr. Crane.           

17:34.800 --> 17:36.600
I-I feel a million times better.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.000
  You know what I'm gonna do?   

17:38.100 --> 17:40.100
  I-I'm gonna... I'm gonna go   
          write Kelly           

17:40.100 --> 17:42.600
  the best darned love letter   
        she's ever had.         

17:42.600 --> 17:44.100
             CLIFF:             
         There you go.          

17:44.100 --> 17:45.800
      (Frasier chuckling)       

17:45.900 --> 17:48.600
                So, uh, some old
             French priest, huh?

17:48.700 --> 17:50.600
I have no idea.                 

17:50.600 --> 17:54.100
    Apparently, Woody dialed    
      the wrong exchange.       

17:54.200 --> 17:58.800
 Somewhere in Belgium, there's  
  a very confused chocolatier.  

18:03.300 --> 18:05.600
    I'm taking things           
    into my own hands here.     

18:05.700 --> 18:07.400
    I hate that damned wall.    

18:07.500 --> 18:09.600
      I'm gonna put my bar      
      back the way it was.      

18:09.700 --> 18:12.600
Coming out, no more bets.       

18:12.600 --> 18:15.000
          Uh, excuse me, you may
          want to move over here
              just a little bit.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.500
      Fellas, you may want      
  to take note where you were   

18:16.500 --> 18:17.800
  the day the wall came down.   

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
        (panting)               

18:34.100 --> 18:35.300
        (panting)               

18:35.400 --> 18:38.100
        Is it down yet?         

18:41.900 --> 18:45.700
        Mr. Hill, wait here just
    one moment, please, okay?   

18:46.900 --> 18:48.200
Sam,                            

18:48.200 --> 18:49.900
      now I don't want you      
        to be mad at me,        

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
  but I brought Mr. Hill here   
 to settle this whole ugly mess 

18:52.100 --> 18:53.300
between the two of you.         

18:53.400 --> 18:55.000
Please say                      
you'll talk to him.             

18:55.100 --> 18:57.900
              Oh, sure, I'd love
                 to talk to him.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.700
                    Not with the
                sledgehammer.   

19:00.700 --> 19:03.500
Aw, I wasn't gonna actually,    
you know, hit him with it.      

19:03.600 --> 19:06.500
I was just gonna drop it        
on his foot by mistake.         

19:06.600 --> 19:08.400
                  No, Sam.      

19:08.500 --> 19:11.200
  Sammy, just let me have it.   

19:11.300 --> 19:13.100
             (thud)             
                    Ow!         

19:13.200 --> 19:16.200
It would have worked, Sam.      

19:16.300 --> 19:17.900
No, I'll just, uh...            

19:18.000 --> 19:20.300
      I'll go talk to him,      
    that's all right.           

19:20.300 --> 19:22.000
Mr. Hill.                       

19:22.000 --> 19:23.100
             John.              

19:23.200 --> 19:25.000
         I'm glad you came back.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.000
          Sit down for a second.
Oh, thank you.                  

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
     Uh, things have just gotten
    too far out of hand here.   

19:30.100 --> 19:32.700
                I mean, come on,
                we're neighbors.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.000
    We need to, well, we need   
      to learn to live together.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.800
          We-we need each other.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.600
I don't need you.               

19:39.600 --> 19:42.300
        Oh, God, you're evil.   

19:45.500 --> 19:48.200
         I can't fight the evil.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.300
     I-I... I give up, Mr. Hill.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.600
        You know,               
    the funny thing is, I...    

19:57.600 --> 19:59.600
     when I got my bar back     
         just recently,         

19:59.700 --> 20:03.300
  I thought, "Hey, Sam, you're  
on top of the world here.       

20:03.400 --> 20:05.300
      "Your life's finally      
        turning around.         

20:05.300 --> 20:09.000
             You're in charge of
              your own destiny."

20:09.000 --> 20:11.300
                But I was wrong.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.900
          You have my bathrooms,
                    Mr. Hill.   

20:14.000 --> 20:15.900
         You hold all the cards.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.400
              You're everything.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.600
                     You're God.

20:18.700 --> 20:21.200
                    I'm nothing.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.400
            Here's your rent.   

20:23.500 --> 20:25.700
I'm sorry, Sam,                 
I was wrong.                    

20:25.800 --> 20:27.400
I don't want your money.        

20:27.400 --> 20:29.100
                You don't?      

20:29.100 --> 20:31.000
No, I just want you to make     
that speech to me in public     

20:31.000 --> 20:32.600
every month                     
when your rent is due.          

20:33.500 --> 20:35.200
            No, no.             

20:35.200 --> 20:37.000
  I was wrong, you're not God.  

20:37.100 --> 20:40.100
 You're-you're some big petty,  
         mean nothing.          

20:40.100 --> 20:42.400
        I'll tell... you know   
              I'm gonna give you
          your rent every month,

20:42.500 --> 20:43.900
and every month from here       
on out, and I'll tell you,      

20:44.000 --> 20:45.300
every time I do I'm gonna write 
        right down here         

20:45.400 --> 20:48.200
        on the memo part        
    "You're not God."           

20:48.200 --> 20:49.700
             There.             

20:49.800 --> 20:51.500
     How do you like that?      

20:51.600 --> 20:54.200
Well, you certainly put me      
          in my place.          

20:56.700 --> 21:00.200
         I'll just, uh,         
    take your money and go.     

21:00.300 --> 21:01.400
    Yeah. Good, good.           

21:01.400 --> 21:03.300
Oh, by the way,                 
when I came in,                 

21:03.400 --> 21:05.600
I noticed they were             
towing your car again.          

21:05.700 --> 21:07.900
        What for?               
  I didn't park in your space.  

21:08.000 --> 21:09.800
 No, but it was in a fire lane. 

21:09.900 --> 21:11.500
I don't make the rules.         

21:11.600 --> 21:15.600
I just notify the authorities   
when they're broken.            

21:15.700 --> 21:17.200
            Oh, God!            

21:17.200 --> 21:20.500
 Oh, he's making me insane! Oh! 

21:20.600 --> 21:22.000
             I'd say that scream
              makes it official.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.300
                      Woody, who
                won the pool?   

21:23.300 --> 21:24.900
            Well...             

21:25.000 --> 21:27.300
            Oh, Sam,            
 you aren't gonna believe this. 

21:27.300 --> 21:28.700
          The winner of the $200

21:28.800 --> 21:31.300
             is our friendly new
         neighbor, John A. Hill.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.600
            (grunts)            

21:33.600 --> 21:35.500
            (yells)             

21:35.600 --> 21:37.700
    He gets paid $200           
    to make me insane?          

21:37.800 --> 21:39.300
No, he can't get away with this.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.200
     No, this is not fair.      
    I'll tell you something,    

21:41.200 --> 21:44.300
  I'm gonna make him take down  
that brick wall, brick by brick,

21:44.400 --> 21:46.500
      with his own little       
     polished fingernails.      

21:46.600 --> 21:48.300
                I need... I need
                    to get back.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.800
                 I need revenge.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.300
         Ooh, yes, yes.         

21:51.400 --> 21:53.000
            The mat.            
        The stupid mat.         

21:53.100 --> 21:54.400
  I've always hated this mat.   

21:54.500 --> 21:56.100
    This is a mat from hell.    

21:56.200 --> 21:58.700
    (grunting)                  

21:58.800 --> 22:01.100
    Never mind. Never mind.     

22:01.200 --> 22:03.900
    Where's my sledgehammer?    

22:03.900 --> 22:07.500
Yeah, die you stupid duck.      

22:07.600 --> 22:08.900
        (grunting)              

22:08.900 --> 22:10.600
CARLA:                          
Sammy.                          

22:10.700 --> 22:12.500
You're not making a dent in it. 

22:12.600 --> 22:14.500
      Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?       
          Watch this.           

22:14.600 --> 22:16.300
        (laughing)              

22:16.400 --> 22:17.600
        (panting)               

22:17.700 --> 22:19.800
      Burn, Donald, burn.       

22:19.900 --> 22:22.300
        (laughing)              

22:22.300 --> 22:26.100
         It won't burn.         

22:26.200 --> 22:28.600
Say, this is a pretty good mat, 
        isn't it?               

22:31.200 --> 22:34.200
    I know what I'm gonna do.   

22:34.300 --> 22:36.700
    I'm gonna take this home    
          for myself.           

22:36.800 --> 22:39.900
      I'm gonna bring back      
    one of those cheap ones,    

22:40.000 --> 22:42.100
     the kind that wear out     
         all the time,          

22:42.200 --> 22:46.700
 and then he'll have to replace 
    it himself every month.     

22:46.700 --> 22:49.400
             I win!
