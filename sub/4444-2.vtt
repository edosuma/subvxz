Previously on The Fosters... 

00:01.822 --> 00:04.290
I gave the money to Ana
so she'd change her story.

00:04.340 --> 00:07.275
- You bribed her?
- I'll tell the DA.

00:07.309 --> 00:10.378
- I want $10,000.
- That freaking woman. I could kill her.

00:10.412 --> 00:12.714
You are gonna stay as far away
from that woman as possible.

00:12.748 --> 00:16.518
You saw Ana Gutierrez in an argument
the night that she went missing?

00:16.552 --> 00:19.554
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah, this is the guy.

00:19.588 --> 00:24.259
- Donald isn't my dad?
- Not according to the birth certificate.

00:24.293 --> 00:26.394
It says Robert Quinn?

00:26.428 --> 00:28.730
[man] Until there is signed
consent from Robert Quinn,

00:28.764 --> 00:31.924
the adoption of Callie Jacob is denied.

00:32.188 --> 00:34.546
Told you I was gonna hit you where it hurt.

00:39.547 --> 00:41.117
[Doctor] Your bones are
shattered in several places.

00:41.343 --> 00:44.245
- He's gonna need surgery.
- He's a pianist.

00:44.279 --> 00:47.148
Our concern right now is making
sure he can still use it at all.

- Can't sleep. You?

01:13.792 --> 01:15.760
Hm...

01:15.794 --> 01:20.565
I remember when you used to crawl
into bed with me when that happened.

01:20.599 --> 01:24.001
Yeah, I thought I'd, uh, spare you tonight.

01:24.036 --> 01:27.738
Hm. Then you'd end up
sprawled out sideways,

01:27.773 --> 01:30.942
your feet next to my head, kicking
me in the face all night long.

01:30.976 --> 01:34.712
See, I remember it as you
headbutting my feet, actually.

01:34.746 --> 01:38.983
Really? Then Mama would viciously
attack your elbows with her ribs?

01:39.017 --> 01:41.719
- Really?
- [laughs]

01:41.753 --> 01:46.824
Yeah. Sorry about that. Sounds terrible.

01:48.994 --> 01:52.830
Eh... it was pretty nice.

01:55.667 --> 01:59.070
Back when that was all it
took to make you feel safe.

02:05.811 --> 02:11.582
- How's it feel?
- About the same.

02:12.818 --> 02:13.784
Still numb?

02:17.990 --> 02:21.659
What if I, um...

02:21.693 --> 02:24.896
... can't ever play again...

02:24.930 --> 02:26.564
... like I used to?

02:28.033 --> 02:29.800
Honey, don't think like that.

02:30.235 --> 02:34.572
You can't think like that, ok?

02:35.974 --> 02:39.644
You just have to keep
trying, keep at it, you know?

02:39.678 --> 02:42.713
Don't you ever give up on
your dream, you hear me?

Sorry, guys, I'll hit the

04:21.697 --> 04:24.432
- Good morning.
- Morning. Are we out of... ?

04:24.466 --> 04:26.834
- Everything!
- Bacon, we've got bacon. Have some bacon. Come on.

04:31.507 --> 04:32.571
I made it last night.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.188
I want everybody home

04:35.477 --> 04:37.411
- Five p.m. Yes?
- Wrestling won't be done...

04:37.446 --> 04:39.714
- What about dance?
- Do I hear six p.m.? Anybody?

04:39.748 --> 04:41.782
I have work, I was just
gonna eat there with Daphne.

04:42.918 --> 04:45.853
But I will eat here instead.

04:45.888 --> 04:48.890
Um, I'm supposed to go to
the batting cages with Connor.

04:50.526 --> 04:52.693
Batting cages, as in baseball?

04:52.728 --> 04:55.496
Yeah, Connor and his dad go all
the time. And they invited me.

04:55.531 --> 04:56.764
- I think that's great, sweetheart.
- Mm.

04:56.798 --> 04:58.799
I never knew you were a baseball guy.

04:58.834 --> 04:59.819
I haven't really played that much.

04:59.820 --> 05:02.565
But who knows, maybe I'm really good.

05:02.771 --> 05:06.707
- Yeah, maybe.
- Just have fun, baby, that's all that counts.

05:08.443 --> 05:10.611
So, Mom, I was thinking about
what you said last night.

05:10.646 --> 05:12.380
- Uh-huh?
- About not giving up?

05:12.414 --> 05:15.716
- Right.
- And I think I want the surgery.

05:15.751 --> 05:19.420
Try to repair the nerve damage.

05:21.456 --> 05:23.524
Ok. Um...

05:23.559 --> 05:26.727
The doctor said that it's a
difficult and complex procedure.

05:26.762 --> 05:30.498
And if things don't go as hoped,
your hand could actually get worse.

05:30.532 --> 05:33.668
Yeah, I mean, she said
there's a chance of that.

05:33.702 --> 05:37.405
She also said that if the
surgery did cause damage,

05:37.439 --> 05:40.541
that it could... it could
actually be permanent.

05:40.576 --> 05:42.643
[Lena] You've got almost
95 percent function now.

05:42.678 --> 05:44.779
That's better than the doctors even hoped.

05:44.813 --> 05:48.649
But if I'm gonna play piano,
though, I need 100 percent.

05:48.684 --> 05:49.750
So I'd like to give it a shot.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.795
- So we agreed? You're good?
- Yeah. It's the right call.

06:00.829 --> 06:02.563
- Ok.
- Ok.

06:02.598 --> 06:04.565
- I'll let Brandon know.
- Ok.

06:04.600 --> 06:08.703
Oh, and tell him if he wants to
come by, that, you know, I'm here.

06:08.737 --> 06:11.706
- I will.
- Ok. Gotta hit the shower.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.708
- Let yourself out?
- Yeah.

06:15.677 --> 06:17.745
Thanks a lot for letting me
barge in like this. Appreciate it.

06:17.779 --> 06:20.748
- Oh, no worries.
- Ok, uh...

06:20.782 --> 06:22.683
You know, there's something
I wanted to ask you,

06:22.718 --> 06:27.388
something Brandon told me about
the night before he was attacked.

06:27.422 --> 06:29.724
- Um...
- [door closes]

06:30.859 --> 06:35.529
- Mike was drinking?
- Oh. Um...

06:35.564 --> 06:37.565
Yeah. He had a little slip,

06:37.599 --> 06:42.436
but he's been sober ever since,
going to meetings every day.

06:42.471 --> 06:45.406
Oh, that's great. Good for him.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.841
Brandon said that he was in a fight.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.443
Yeah, I guess so.

06:49.478 --> 06:51.646
He blacked out so he didn't
really remember anything.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.848
Oh, gosh...

06:53.882 --> 06:57.418
But there was blood on his hands
when you found him? That's...

06:57.452 --> 07:01.389
A little. He was fine.

07:01.423 --> 07:05.493
- Was it his blood?
- Stef.

07:05.527 --> 07:09.430
If you have questions about Mike's
sobriety, you have to ask him.

07:09.464 --> 07:12.767
Of course. Of course I
should. You're right. Sorry.

07:12.801 --> 07:15.703
Thank you so much for
the coffee. Appreciate it.

07:25.781 --> 07:30.484
All right, Jude, just keep
your eye on the ball, buddy.

07:35.524 --> 07:40.428
[laughs] Takes a little getting
used to. Just hang in there, kid.

07:42.531 --> 07:44.340
- [bat clatters]
- Um, you might wanna

07:44.341 --> 07:45.998
hang on to the bat a little tighter too.

07:46.135 --> 07:48.602
Here, grab another one, all right?
Hey, Connor, let's go, come on.

07:48.637 --> 07:50.638
Throw a token in there, let's
see what you got. Come on, buddy.

07:52.841 --> 07:54.442
What'd we talk about this year?

07:54.476 --> 07:55.876
- Balance and torque.
- That's right, come on.

07:55.911 --> 07:57.745
Let's go! See what you got.

08:00.482 --> 08:03.751
Hey, your head's moving all over the
place, like this. You're all over.

08:05.787 --> 08:09.490
Connor, pivot the back
foot. Pivot like this. Pivot.

08:10.659 --> 08:11.792
That's better.

08:13.829 --> 08:15.796
Hey, way to go. Nice hit. Good job.

08:15.831 --> 08:19.533
Look, that front foot's gotta
land in the same place every time.

08:19.568 --> 08:22.536
- It slipped.
- No excuses! Come on!

08:22.571 --> 08:27.708
Hey, what's the matter with you? Your
focus is all over the place today.

08:27.743 --> 08:32.379
- [slurping]
- Need a refill? A soda?

08:32.414 --> 08:35.750
- Uh, it's a vanilla shake.
- Oh, yeah. We don't do refills on shakes.

08:35.784 --> 08:39.653
- Yeah. I figured.
- Yeah, vanilla's my favorite.

08:39.688 --> 08:41.655
It has to be really good vanilla, though.

08:41.690 --> 08:44.725
You should, um, check out
the place down the street,

08:44.760 --> 08:48.395
in the mini-mall on
Olamar. Best shakes in town.

08:48.430 --> 08:51.432
[chuckles]

08:51.466 --> 08:54.602
Do you work every day after
school? That's gotta be tough.

08:54.636 --> 08:55.890
Um, no, just three days.

08:55.891 --> 08:57.667
My moms don't want me to
work any more than that.

08:57.672 --> 09:00.574
- Moms?
- Yeah.

09:00.609 --> 09:04.378
- Cool.
- It is.

09:05.514 --> 09:06.514
[clears throat]

09:06.548 --> 09:08.482
Oh, don't worry, I'll grab that.

09:08.517 --> 09:11.585
Oh, thanks. See you soon.

09:11.620 --> 09:15.523
Oh... down the street, I'm telling you.

09:20.529 --> 09:24.565
- You're really good.
- Not good enough.

09:24.599 --> 09:26.700
I thought you did great,
way better than me.

09:26.735 --> 09:28.836
I'm supposed to be good at this.

09:38.513 --> 09:39.713
- Damn!
- What?

09:39.748 --> 09:42.483
- Someone left us a hundred-dollar tip!
- What?

09:42.517 --> 09:45.686
- A hundred dollars, yo!
- Oh, my God! Who do you think it was?

09:45.720 --> 09:48.756
I don't know. Vanilla milkshake?
He sure was chatting you up.

09:48.790 --> 09:51.525
- Please.
- Come on, girl. You know he likes you.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.861
- [laughs] Shut up.
- He wants some of that.

09:53.895 --> 09:56.597
- Daphne!
- If he keeps giving us hundred dollars bills,

09:56.631 --> 09:59.733
- he can have all the vanilla milkshake he want!
- Ow!

09:59.968 --> 10:03.537
I just don't understand why
we have to do any of this.

10:03.572 --> 10:05.773
Well, if you want him to
sign off, these are his terms.

10:05.807 --> 10:08.776
Yes, but it makes no sense. It's not
like she's asking him for anything.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.714
Sit down, love.

10:20.589 --> 10:23.824
So, Callie, we heard back
from Robert Quinn's lawyer.

10:23.859 --> 10:28.662
- Ok.
- And he won't sign anything until there's a DNA test,

10:28.697 --> 10:31.765
to prove that you're his daughter. So...

10:38.506 --> 10:39.874
[scoffs]

10:42.158 --> 10:44.495
I seriously can't handle sharing
the gym with the wrestlers anymore.

10:45.002 --> 10:48.170
- The gym smells like feet.
- Well, that's appetizing.

10:48.205 --> 10:51.207
And all the boys ever
do is stare at us. Pervs.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.430
Well, it's not awesome for me either,

10:52.431 --> 10:54.666
hearing guys talk about
how hot my sister is.

10:55.145 --> 10:58.147
- Which guys?
- Besides, I see the dance team checking us out too.

10:58.181 --> 11:00.783
That Hayley girl, can't
take her eyes off me.

11:00.817 --> 11:03.853
Oh, yeah? Hayley, the one with
the college boyfriend Hayley?

11:03.887 --> 11:04.800
She dates boys in college?

11:04.801 --> 11:06.980
None of the girls on the dance
team date boys in high school.

11:07.157 --> 11:09.992
- Oh. We'll see about that.
- Better not let Emma hear you.

11:10.027 --> 11:13.162
- Please, I can handle Emma.
- [laughter]

11:13.196 --> 11:13.792
What?

11:13.793 --> 11:16.161
I pretty sure no one handles Emma but Emma.

11:16.867 --> 11:20.136
Hey, Brandon! We'd like
to eat, sometime this year!

11:20.170 --> 11:23.005
Jude, how did the batting cages go?

11:23.040 --> 11:26.776
Do we need to call the Padres, see if
they need another big hit in their lineup?

11:26.810 --> 11:27.977
- Huh?
- I don't think so.

11:28.011 --> 11:32.181
Oh, come on! Planning my retirement.

11:32.215 --> 11:35.751
- Bread me.
- Oh! Guys!

11:35.786 --> 11:39.221
So we, uh, make an appointment
yet for the hand surgeon?

11:40.924 --> 11:44.827
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

11:44.861 --> 11:46.862
Um...

11:46.897 --> 11:49.832
Well, I talked it all
over with your father.

11:49.866 --> 11:54.770
Is this about money or something? Isn't
that what the settlement from Vico is for?

11:54.805 --> 11:58.207
- Fix my freaking hand?
- No, Brandon, it's not about money.

11:59.776 --> 12:01.043
We just, um...

12:02.979 --> 12:05.815
we just feel that it's a
little too risky, Brandon.

12:05.849 --> 12:09.151
And, uh... your father and I are saying no.

12:13.190 --> 12:16.025
I don't get this.

12:16.059 --> 12:19.028
It's my hand, my money, my life.

12:19.062 --> 12:22.131
And I wanna play piano
again. Like, really play.

12:22.165 --> 12:25.735
Why is this so hard to
understand? I want the surgery.

12:25.769 --> 12:28.804
Brandon, we are eating dinner.
Can we please discuss this later?

12:28.839 --> 12:31.040
Yeah, well, I'm not hungry.

12:39.182 --> 12:42.885
- So you talked to Mike?
- This afternoon.

12:42.919 --> 12:44.787
Oh.

12:44.821 --> 12:48.891
And you just... decided?

12:50.961 --> 12:52.194
[Jesus] Shouldn't it be Brandon's decision?

12:52.229 --> 12:53.863
He's the one who got his ass kicked.

12:53.897 --> 12:57.032
I wouldn't put it that way,
but that's a good point.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.903
What if it doesn't work? I mean, what
if he can't use his fingers at all?

13:00.937 --> 13:03.005
Look, Mike and I talked
through all of this.

13:03.039 --> 13:07.710
And you made your decision. Got it.

13:14.951 --> 13:16.152
[knock on door]

13:18.155 --> 13:20.122
Hey.

13:20.157 --> 13:23.959
Nice coat rack.

13:23.994 --> 13:26.729
Yeah, well, might as
well use it for something.

13:26.763 --> 13:29.064
Brandon.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.200
I mean, you can still play, right?

13:31.234 --> 13:32.968
Not classical. Not the way I did.

13:33.003 --> 13:35.938
OK, so all music is dead to you then?

13:35.972 --> 13:38.908
- No, but...
- Well, it sounds like that's what you're risking,

13:38.942 --> 13:41.877
- if you have this surgery.
- Ok.

13:41.912 --> 13:45.147
Look, I had a future.

13:45.182 --> 13:47.049
That's not something you just throw away.
