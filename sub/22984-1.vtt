Joseph Conrad wrote:

00:27.735 --> 00:33.970
If you want to know the age of the
Earth, look upon the sea in a storm.

00:36.477 --> 00:41.505
But what storm can fully reveal
the heart of a man?

00:52.961 --> 00:56.590
Between Suez and the China Sea
are many nameless men...

00:56.764 --> 00:59.699
...who prefer to live and die unknown.

01:01.202 --> 01:04.797
This is the story of one such man.

01:05.006 --> 01:07.702
Among the great gallery
of rogues and heroes...

01:07.909 --> 01:10.844
...thrown up on the beaches
and ports...

01:11.012 --> 01:16.279
...no man was more respected
or more damned than...

02:44.138 --> 02:47.130
The story of Jim begins
when Queen Victorias fleet...

02:47.308 --> 02:52.541
...of merchant ships served
a vast empire of trade and commerce.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.274
On the day he received
his sailing papers...

02:55.450 --> 02:58.248
...Jims class proved
it was shipshape.

02:58.419 --> 03:03.254
It was a gray, overcast,
ominous day...

03:03.424 --> 03:05.085
...but not for Jim.

03:05.293 --> 03:09.229
For him, it was the beginning
of an honorable career.

03:28.249 --> 03:32.618
He was particularly smart aloft,
especially in the tgallant yards.

03:32.787 --> 03:35.984
There, he could live out
his private dreams...

03:36.157 --> 03:38.955
...the kind of dreams most of us have.

03:47.468 --> 03:50.596
Even on graduation day,
it was clear that Jim...

03:50.772 --> 03:55.869
...was the sort of man you would trust
on sight. One of us, so to speak.

03:56.043 --> 04:00.412
He was exactly the kind of man
I wanted on the deck of my ship.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.886
He found life exacting, but dull.

04:11.659 --> 04:15.151
Demanding, but empty.

04:30.812 --> 04:35.840
Theres such a magnificent vagueness
that drives some of us to roam the sea.

04:36.050 --> 04:40.749
Such a beautiful greed
for adventure and mystery.

04:41.255 --> 04:44.782
He withdrew
into a private world of fantasy.

04:44.959 --> 04:48.918
For which of us has not dreamed
of rescuing a pretty girl...

04:49.096 --> 04:51.826
...on a picturesque raft?

04:51.999 --> 04:55.594
In these flights of fancy,
he won fame, fortune...

04:55.770 --> 05:00.264
...and respect by saving his captain
from a very nasty mutiny.

05:00.441 --> 05:02.875
Single-handed, of course.

05:22.129 --> 05:28.557
Jim was acclaimed, loved,
and, above all, trusted.

05:32.139 --> 05:38.510
Then, on a calm day,
in a perfectly smooth sea...

05:38.679 --> 05:43.912
...Jim met his first seagoing hazard
face to face.

05:54.695 --> 05:56.424
We put in at the nearest port...

05:58.132 --> 06:01.033
...so that Jim could have
proper hospital care.

06:09.343 --> 06:11.004
Goodbye, sir.

06:49.717 --> 06:53.483
The other patients were delighted
to be safe on land.

06:53.688 --> 06:58.489
But Jim craved the open sea, action.

06:58.726 --> 07:03.629
Meanwhile, he haunted
the teeming waterfronts.

07:04.098 --> 07:09.627
He held himself aloof
from the uprooted human wrecks.

07:22.149 --> 07:25.607
How about a couple of coppers, sir?
They'll help me.

07:27.455 --> 07:28.854
Thank you.

07:51.379 --> 07:54.371
Directly, he could navigate
without a stick.

07:54.548 --> 07:58.177
He signed on
with the first available ship.

08:00.121 --> 08:04.615
That ship was the SS Patna.

08:10.064 --> 08:13.363
Mister, you're looking at a dead ship
for certain.

08:18.205 --> 08:21.470
She was bound for the Red Sea.

08:21.642 --> 08:28.138
Cargo: 800 Muslims
on a holy pilgrimage to Mecca.

08:46.567 --> 08:51.061
Good morning, captain.
I'm the new first officer.

09:25.339 --> 09:26.966
How long you was first officer?

09:27.141 --> 09:29.439
- Two years.
- British, huh?

10:19.760 --> 10:24.129
The ship was peaceful, secure.

10:24.298 --> 10:27.665
The world was firm
beneath his feet.

10:27.835 --> 10:33.432
He felt that he alone was responsible
for every soul aboard ship.

10:33.707 --> 10:36.369
He was equal to the challenge.

10:36.544 --> 10:40.036
There was nothing
he could not face.

10:52.660 --> 10:55.288
Hey, mister, barometer dropping fast.

10:55.462 --> 10:57.862
- For how long, sir?
- How the devil I know?

10:58.032 --> 11:03.129
I get up, she's down.
I think soon we catch a squall.

11:03.304 --> 11:05.864
Then maybe this old iron stove
cools off, huh?

11:06.040 --> 11:09.066
Mr. Robinson!
Cut your engines to half speed.

11:09.577 --> 11:14.207
No! Shut up!
Keep her steady as she goes.

11:16.750 --> 11:20.584
Hot. "Hot" is no name
for it down below.

11:20.754 --> 11:22.881
What are you doing on my bridge?

11:23.090 --> 11:25.320
Where'd you expect me
to take a breather?

11:25.593 --> 11:29.586
Down that hellhole
with them scurvy toads?

11:29.763 --> 11:32.357
What you? Drunk?

11:32.566 --> 11:35.558
How else can I stand this
godforsaken stinkpot?

11:35.736 --> 11:39.866
I throw you in the brig, you scum!

11:59.593 --> 12:02.221
- What is it?
- The chart shows 100 fathoms.

12:02.396 --> 12:05.024
- Something afloat, awash?
- More.

12:05.199 --> 12:07.759
- We're stove in, done for.
- Where are you going?

12:07.935 --> 12:09.630
To see if there's damage below.

12:22.149 --> 12:25.084
- I heard something.
- No cause for alarm, sir.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.119
- It seemed...
- It's the fog.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.613
Makes us imagine things.

12:51.679 --> 12:53.340
It's all right.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.544
They only wanted water.

13:19.940 --> 13:23.376
I felt it bulge, I swear.
There's a million tons of pressure...

13:23.577 --> 13:28.276
...and nothing holding it back
but this rusty brown paper. Paper!

13:28.482 --> 13:31.144
- She'll go down like a lump of lead.
- Shut up!

13:31.318 --> 13:34.219
- We'll shore it up.
- Listen.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.335
- She's coming apart.
- Wait!

13:49.503 --> 13:52.870
There's no time. There's 800
of them and only two boats!

13:53.040 --> 13:55.304
- Shut your engines off!
- There's no time...

13:55.476 --> 13:57.205
Shut your engines off!

13:59.113 --> 14:00.740
Yes, sir.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.547
Very sensible.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.482
Clear thinking, sir.

14:07.688 --> 14:10.179
Hurry!

14:15.662 --> 14:19.928
There, in the dark,
alone with the unexpected...

14:20.167 --> 14:23.933
...Jim was finally infected
with the other mans terror.

14:24.138 --> 14:30.168
His imagination made him see
what he feared to see.

15:07.948 --> 15:11.748
Yes. Yes.

15:14.321 --> 15:17.119
- Are we in danger?
- Only if you panic!

15:17.291 --> 15:19.486
You must let me free the lifeboats.

15:19.726 --> 15:21.626
Why, so you can abandon us?

15:25.899 --> 15:27.890
You believe that?

15:30.003 --> 15:31.664
No.

15:31.839 --> 15:34.399
Let him pass. Let him pass.

15:55.429 --> 15:57.124
Lend a hand, quick.

15:57.297 --> 16:02.291
- We've got to free both of the boats.
- Sure, sure, but one at a time.

16:29.463 --> 16:32.159
We got to clear out
before the storm hits.

16:34.134 --> 16:36.261
Push! Push!

16:37.304 --> 16:39.898
- What about them?
- Who?

16:42.009 --> 16:43.977
Them!

16:45.479 --> 16:49.575
They're dead! Finished!
Nothing can save them!

18:14.434 --> 18:18.461
- Jump! Hurry!
- Jump!

18:18.639 --> 18:20.266
Hurry! Jump!

18:20.440 --> 18:24.240
Jump! Jump! Hurry up!

18:24.411 --> 18:28.575
- Jump! Hurry!
- Jump!

19:39.686 --> 19:42.712
Well, we're all in the same boat.

19:42.889 --> 19:44.880
We all gotta have the same story.

19:45.726 --> 19:49.218
- I don't know...
- She sank, didn't she?

19:49.396 --> 19:50.988
I saw her.

19:51.164 --> 19:55.328
I saw her go down with all hands.

19:55.535 --> 19:58.527
Gone. I swear it.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.231
All them poor heathens.

20:04.010 --> 20:09.414
Hey, you! It's a lucky thing we jump!
You understand?

21:12.245 --> 21:14.008
To the trio of dirty owls...

21:14.181 --> 21:18.515
...the Patnas rescue
was proof of their desertion.

21:18.685 --> 21:23.952
Jim saw it as a monstrous
practical joke on himself.

21:32.632 --> 21:34.827
Paper! Paper!

21:35.769 --> 21:39.432
There never would have been
an open inquiry if Jim had vanished...

21:39.606 --> 21:41.471
...with the others.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.667
When he insisted on making
a public confession...

21:44.845 --> 21:48.042
...the Patna affair became
a public disgrace.

21:48.215 --> 21:51.150
- What changed your mind?
- He did.

21:51.651 --> 21:55.678
- How?
- He gave his word. I trusted him.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.687
Evidently, you were mistaken.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.689
Thank you very much.

22:01.027 --> 22:03.518
The French officer, please.

22:08.168 --> 22:11.626
- You salvaged the Patna?
- Yes, sir.

22:11.805 --> 22:14.865
Would you say that the ship
was in danger of sinking?

22:15.041 --> 22:19.000
- Possibly. When we towed her in...
- That is not the point.

22:19.179 --> 22:22.342
Danger is never the barometer
of an officer's conduct.

22:23.817 --> 22:26.581
Will you admit, lieutenant,
that his behavior...

22:26.753 --> 22:29.745
...was the unmitigated,
inexcusable act of a coward?

22:29.990 --> 22:33.016
It is not for me to say
if another man is a coward.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.885
Isn't that a decoration for bravery?

22:36.062 --> 22:41.159
In a war, in front of others,
one is expected to be brave.

22:41.334 --> 22:42.892
The trade of war demands it.

22:43.336 --> 22:45.861
At sea, we're always at war
with the elements.

22:46.072 --> 22:48.563
Officers are expected
to go down with the ship.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.438
- Honor demands it.
- Honor?

22:51.645 --> 22:55.206
- Honor is a personal thing.
- Very well! The law demands it.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.407
What law?
Where is such a law written?

22:58.919 --> 23:03.151
Among civilized men, there's such
a thing as the unwritten law.

23:04.691 --> 23:08.752
An idea created
by insurance companies.

23:08.929 --> 23:13.525
Necessary because if even one
crewman remains on board...

23:13.733 --> 23:15.963
...the ship cannot be claimed
as salvage.

23:16.202 --> 23:18.363
Then loyalty. What about loyalty?

23:18.571 --> 23:21.233
Once, there was loyalty
to ships under sail...

23:21.441 --> 23:24.774
...but when ships changed to steam,
perhaps men changed too.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.111
Could you do what he did?

23:29.049 --> 23:30.607
Who knows?

23:30.784 --> 23:35.278
Under certain conditions,
fear will come to any man.

23:36.456 --> 23:40.187
It's always there, waiting for us.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.290
- The fear.
- Thank you very much, lieutenant.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.451
Why?

24:08.355 --> 24:12.018
Why did you insist
on eating all that dirt?

24:12.759 --> 24:15.421
How could you make
that disgusting confession...

24:15.595 --> 24:21.261
...in public, before all those
grinning natives?

24:22.736 --> 24:24.636
If you had to rut around
in shame...

24:24.804 --> 24:29.036
...why didn't you run, hide, crawl 20
feet underground where you belong?

24:31.878 --> 24:34.745
Do you realize what
you've done here today?

24:36.316 --> 24:38.147
Do you know what you've done?

24:38.318 --> 24:41.981
You're one of us.
Your disgrace reflects on us.

24:42.155 --> 24:44.817
You put all of us on trial!

24:46.326 --> 24:48.954
Don't you understand that?

24:51.264 --> 24:53.061
Yes, sir.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.633
I understand.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.531
Jim! Jim!

25:47.353 --> 25:50.686
He beat his way from port to port...

25:50.857 --> 25:54.759
...trying to lose himself
among the nameless.

25:54.961 --> 25:58.294
He no longer dreamed
of fame or glory.

25:58.465 --> 26:02.424
He no longer wanted
to dream at all.

26:03.570 --> 26:09.736
He took on any job,
anywhere, for any pay.

26:09.976 --> 26:11.375
Up to the hotel, boy.

26:11.544 --> 26:14.240
He craved anonymity.

26:14.414 --> 26:18.578
He wanted, finally, to become
one of the nameless flotsam...

26:18.751 --> 26:22.983
...he formerly had scorned
and pitied.

26:23.723 --> 26:26.920
He hungered to forget his failure...

26:27.093 --> 26:31.325
...the recurring nightmare
aboard the Patna.

26:31.498 --> 26:33.989
But the scandal followed him...

26:34.167 --> 26:35.896
...found him...

26:36.069 --> 26:37.900
...made him run again.

26:42.308 --> 26:48.338
The perfect skipper had jumped,
it seems, from his own ship.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.243
His final entry in the ships log read:

26:52.418 --> 26:56.411
If fear can find the flaw
in even one of us...

26:56.589 --> 26:59.581
...why not in any of us?

27:02.028 --> 27:07.159
One hope kept Jim going,
a hope common to most men.

27:07.333 --> 27:10.325
Rich or poor, strong or weak...

27:10.503 --> 27:15.941
...who among us has not begged God
for a second chance?

29:06.452 --> 29:08.079
Jump! Jump!

29:09.322 --> 29:13.782
Jump! Jump! Jump!

31:05.505 --> 31:08.941
You did not jump
with the others. Why?

31:09.709 --> 31:11.574
Maybe I can't swim.

31:13.045 --> 31:16.014
So much depends on this cargo.

31:19.519 --> 31:22.454
No, wait. Please.

31:23.456 --> 31:25.219
The fire was not accidental.

31:26.025 --> 31:28.687
The men on your boat,
you know them?

31:30.596 --> 31:32.461
Could I ask your name, please?

31:32.665 --> 31:34.530
Herr Stein?

31:35.735 --> 31:37.896
Shall we put the powder
in the warehouse?

31:38.070 --> 31:40.231
No. We move it upcountry tonight.

31:42.542 --> 31:45.773
Now, this could never show
my gratitude, but...

31:59.625 --> 32:01.115
You!

32:14.340 --> 32:16.638
Is it really yourself, Jim, lad?

32:16.809 --> 32:20.905
It's me, your old shipmate.

32:21.080 --> 32:25.949
You're not gonna forget I saved your
life aboard that bucket, the SS Patna.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.143
No need to feel uneasy.

32:28.354 --> 32:30.481
Not on my account.

32:37.964 --> 32:42.594
I know just how you feel, mate.
It's a mean, untidy world run by toads.

32:42.768 --> 32:44.599
What is it you want, Mr. Robinson?

32:44.770 --> 32:48.672
God bless you, lad, just a couple
of quid to see me through.

33:13.633 --> 33:15.533
Stop. Hello.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.393
Mr. Stein, please.

33:18.638 --> 33:21.971
Can you show me one butterfly
with a weak heart?

33:22.141 --> 33:25.975
Can you show me one butterfly
who's a 70-year-old businessman?

33:26.546 --> 33:29.640
- What can I do for you, please?
- Mr. Stein.

33:30.349 --> 33:33.341
- Up here, young man.
- Sit down, please.

33:33.853 --> 33:36.287
Here, a rare specimen of life.

33:36.489 --> 33:39.014
- Perfection.
- Beautiful.

33:39.191 --> 33:43.150
Beauty's nothing.
Look at the accuracy, the harmony.

33:44.430 --> 33:46.591
Fragile but strong.

33:46.799 --> 33:50.428
The exact balance
of colossal forces.

33:51.037 --> 33:52.402
Masterpiece.

33:52.572 --> 33:56.668
Look into the body of man
for a real masterpiece.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.868
Man is amazing, yes,
but too many flaws.

34:01.047 --> 34:03.208
Man makes too much noise
about himself.

34:03.382 --> 34:05.543
Disturbs the equilibrium.

34:05.718 --> 34:10.678
He wants to be a saint,
and he wants also to be a devil.

34:11.090 --> 34:16.187
Always, he wants to be what he is not.
What do you think?

34:17.029 --> 34:19.793
I think you ought not to go
upcountry tonight.

34:19.966 --> 34:23.367
Be a nice butterfly.
Stay in your cocoon.

34:23.536 --> 34:26.471
And for this, one of these.

34:26.639 --> 34:29.870
No smoking, no excitement.
Everything in moderation.

34:30.042 --> 34:32.101
Even death?

34:33.379 --> 34:36.438
If I had your strong, young heart...

34:38.618 --> 34:42.054
Is your burden really so heavy
as you look?

34:43.356 --> 34:45.449
- No, sir.
- Good.

34:46.158 --> 34:49.924
- I want to ship out tonight.
- That is not so serious.

34:50.096 --> 34:52.223
Where are you bound? What port?

34:52.398 --> 34:54.297
It doesn't matter.

34:55.501 --> 34:57.162
That makes it serious.

34:59.672 --> 35:01.071
I don't want your money.

35:01.574 --> 35:04.475
Just mine, or anyone's?

35:04.644 --> 35:07.875
- Take it. I owe you...
- Nothing.

35:08.748 --> 35:12.980
I do not trust a man
who does not respect money.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.887
One moment, please.

35:18.157 --> 35:22.321
If you want to be an idealist,
you must also be tolerant.

35:22.762 --> 35:25.287
Are you running from the police?

35:30.202 --> 35:32.397
So much pride.

35:34.106 --> 35:36.700
Even you must have a name.

35:40.546 --> 35:43.709
- Jim.
- That's all? Jim?

35:47.853 --> 35:50.151
A man of mystery, huh?

35:52.525 --> 35:56.291
Today, you risked your life
for who-knows-what reason.

35:56.462 --> 36:00.831
Would you risk it again
for ambition, chivalry, adventure?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.332
Are you making an offer?

36:05.304 --> 36:08.068
The role of a hero appeals, huh?

36:11.877 --> 36:16.075
It might interest you to know that
some men can never become heroes...

36:16.248 --> 36:18.409
...and some heroes
never become men.

36:18.584 --> 36:20.677
And some are lucky enough
to be both.

36:20.853 --> 36:23.344
Who says they are lucky?

36:25.024 --> 36:26.685
Now...

36:26.859 --> 36:29.828
...if someone tries
to make another fire...

36:29.995 --> 36:31.690
...kill him.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.678
That stuff makes you uneasy?

36:50.850 --> 36:54.479
Well, sir, gunpowder
is highly impersonal.

36:55.721 --> 36:58.087
It will blow up anybody.

36:58.858 --> 37:02.988
- How fast can you load and fire a rifle?
- About five seconds.

37:03.162 --> 37:06.928
Well, this weapon can shoot
five bullets in the same time.

37:08.033 --> 37:11.594
- Is somebody gonna fight?
- Well, it doesn't have to be your fight.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.864
- Is it yours?
- Yes.

37:14.039 --> 37:17.702
For pleasure, profit or patriotism?

37:17.877 --> 37:20.209
Nothing so noble.

37:20.379 --> 37:24.042
I go to help a friend,
if it is not too late.

37:24.216 --> 37:27.617
Now, tomorrow we come
to Batu Kring.

37:27.787 --> 37:31.553
End of railroad, end of province,
end of police escort.

37:33.225 --> 37:34.590
Our destination...

37:36.295 --> 37:39.958
...Patusan. By engine boat, 12 hours
away, through enemy country...

37:40.132 --> 37:43.590
...and no protection,
sitting on all that dynamite...

37:43.769 --> 37:46.397
...which somebody
already tried to destroy.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.800
Well...

37:48.974 --> 37:50.669
...what do you say?

37:50.843 --> 37:53.505
I'd say our situation...

37:53.679 --> 37:55.977
...was highly inflammable.

37:58.417 --> 38:00.578
What do you expect to find
in Patusan?

38:01.921 --> 38:04.116
I was rather hoping...

38:04.790 --> 38:06.621
...to find paradise.

38:09.562 --> 38:12.622
Patusan is like a jump
into the unknown.

38:13.065 --> 38:15.932
My first trading post was in Patusan.

38:16.101 --> 38:18.831
And my first friend
was Chief Du-Ramin.

38:19.004 --> 38:22.064
We fought side by side
against river pirates.

38:24.510 --> 38:30.346
But today, 30 years later, the enemy
is a warlord without a country...

38:30.516 --> 38:34.680
...a precise militarist,
intelligent, ruthless, and deadly...

38:34.854 --> 38:37.618
...with an army
of escaped criminals, riffraff.

38:37.790 --> 38:42.159
The General suppresses thousands,
collects taxes, also tribute.

38:42.328 --> 38:46.128
From here, rubber. From this province,
tea and precious stones.

38:46.298 --> 38:48.459
Patusan, tin.

38:48.634 --> 38:52.695
And those who refuse to operate the
mines now work as chained prisoners!

38:53.405 --> 38:55.168
Life is cheaper than tin.

38:55.341 --> 39:00.040
So on a certain day,
all men will mine tin or be shot.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.542
And that certain day
will be three days from now.

39:03.716 --> 39:06.207
But on that day, people will resist.

39:09.255 --> 39:10.916
Resist.

39:13.492 --> 39:16.757
One old, rusty cannon,
useless without that powder.

39:16.929 --> 39:21.559
Without these weapons,
it will be spears against rifles.

39:22.034 --> 39:24.764
But if we don't get there on time...

39:24.937 --> 39:26.370
...or not at all?

39:26.538 --> 39:29.006
They will still resist.

39:30.042 --> 39:34.672
- What with?
- Mostly with courage.

39:51.563 --> 39:54.396
- Schomberg!
- Just a minute.

39:55.701 --> 39:57.396
Schomberg!

40:04.977 --> 40:07.411
Where is Schomberg's engine boat?

40:24.563 --> 40:26.224
Schomberg.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.895
Schomberg!

40:30.336 --> 40:36.764
Hello, hello! Welcome,
Papa Stein, you look sensational.

40:36.942 --> 40:39.069
- Where is the boat?
- Take your pick...

40:39.244 --> 40:43.806
...sampan, sailboat, barge.
What you want, Schomberg's got.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.679
- You promised the engine boat.
- True, true.

40:46.852 --> 40:49.286
- Well, where is it?
- Where else? In dry dock.

40:49.455 --> 40:52.117
- Fungus, dry rot, terrible shape.
- I will buy it.

40:52.291 --> 40:54.782
- No, no, it's not for sale.
- But you promised.

40:54.960 --> 40:57.520
Yeah, a promise
straight from the heart.

40:57.730 --> 41:00.995
The heart says "yes,"
but the conditions say "no."

41:01.166 --> 41:05.603
All my life, I'm a victim of conditions,
so it's got to be "no."

41:18.517 --> 41:20.849
Better you don't go
where you're going.

41:21.020 --> 41:25.480
Nobody gets up that river, not alive,
not since the General.

41:25.657 --> 41:28.888
Positively not carrying
contraband cargo.

41:29.995 --> 41:34.329
- How do you know it's contraband?
- I know nothing. I don't even know you.

41:34.500 --> 41:38.334
- You've got your business, I got mine.
- Your business is renting boats.

41:38.504 --> 41:41.166
Please, my business
is to stay in business.

41:41.340 --> 41:44.241
You can have any boat I got,
but not the engine boat.

41:44.410 --> 41:46.776
The one at the pier rigged for sail.

41:46.945 --> 41:50.847
- You can't push her up the river alone.
- Get me a couple of men.

41:51.650 --> 41:56.144
That's very funny, mister.
You think everybody is dying to die?

41:56.321 --> 42:00.519
At most, a few fools who are
desperate for money. Ridiculous.

42:00.993 --> 42:02.722
Get them!

42:04.229 --> 42:08.222
- Get them.
- I can see you're a born leader.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.664
Leave it to Schomberg.

42:12.538 --> 42:14.597
Do you want a doctor?

42:14.807 --> 42:17.401
Does he have a prescription
for failure?

42:17.576 --> 42:20.067
We haven't failed yet, sir.

42:20.245 --> 42:24.238
Without the engine boat,
there is not enough time.

42:24.416 --> 42:28.079
- Not enough time.
- We can rig a sail.

42:28.253 --> 42:30.016
And if there's no wind?

42:30.189 --> 42:33.716
Then we'll row, paddle, push.

42:33.892 --> 42:35.587
For 20 hours?

42:35.761 --> 42:37.729
We can try.

42:38.630 --> 42:40.291
Yes.

42:40.466 --> 42:43.731
- Yes, we can try.
- You're not coming.

42:43.902 --> 42:47.065
- But without me...
- We might make it.

42:47.573 --> 42:49.234
You can't pull your own weight.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.203
No offense, sir.

43:08.760 --> 43:12.924
This elephant camp is halfway point.
You must reach it by morning.

43:13.098 --> 43:16.499
After that is a little difficult
and dangerous.

43:16.668 --> 43:18.727
If you sail openly into Patusan...

43:18.904 --> 43:22.499
...the only welcome you expect
is a bullet or worse.

43:22.975 --> 43:25.000
Now, Du-Ramin's people expect us.

43:25.177 --> 43:28.078
His plan is simple. Also, it is tricky.

43:28.247 --> 43:31.910
Two miles before you reach Patusan,
you find these ruins.

43:32.084 --> 43:34.951
And behind them,
hidden in the jungle...

43:40.792 --> 43:44.751
Try not to use the rifle.
Even one shot would upset the plan.

43:44.930 --> 43:48.923
These weapons must not fall to
the General under any conditions.

43:49.101 --> 43:52.400
If such a thing happens,
destroy the rifles, everything.

43:52.838 --> 43:55.807
You are under no obligation to me,
even now.

43:55.974 --> 43:58.602
- Lf you wish to...
- Jump?

43:58.777 --> 44:02.440
...withdraw, I would understand.

44:05.450 --> 44:08.647
- Your man at the trading post...
- Cornelius?

44:08.820 --> 44:10.515
- Can he be trusted?
- Why?

44:11.356 --> 44:13.984
Well, you haven't said
much about him.

44:14.159 --> 44:17.322
You haven't said much about yourself,
but I trust you.

44:17.663 --> 44:20.131
We each have our weaknesses.

44:20.299 --> 44:23.791
I am too romantic,
Cornelius drinks too much...

44:23.969 --> 44:27.166
...and you?
- Goodbye, sir.

44:28.807 --> 44:32.038
- Is there nothing I can do for you?
- Yes, sir.

44:32.211 --> 44:33.872
Cast off.

44:34.046 --> 44:38.710
If I knew where I could write
your parents, your friends...

44:38.884 --> 44:41.682
...and tell them... what?

44:42.821 --> 44:44.482
Tell them...

44:45.657 --> 44:47.318
...nothing.

46:04.269 --> 46:05.930
Kill him.

46:07.606 --> 46:09.972
Captain, this man wants to kill...

46:15.647 --> 46:19.549
You see? That crazy rascal
tried to kill you.

46:21.086 --> 46:22.610
Sun sickness, I bet you.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.586
Lucky for you, l...

46:28.160 --> 46:31.618
- What for you do that, sir?
- Sun sickness.

46:32.664 --> 46:36.293
That gun cannot shoot
without you put another bullet in, sir...

46:46.111 --> 46:47.476
Pick up that oar.

46:51.316 --> 46:52.806
Sir.

50:42.213 --> 50:44.613
General, I salute you.

50:44.816 --> 50:46.545
Well?

50:53.525 --> 50:55.550
Your information correct.

50:56.895 --> 51:01.764
Coming from trading company of Stein,
weapons, gunpowder.

51:05.070 --> 51:08.233
- Weapons?
- Rifles.

51:16.948 --> 51:18.609
How many?

51:21.853 --> 51:24.083
The man who brought them?

51:25.290 --> 51:26.951
Alone?

51:51.916 --> 51:54.350
Big bang, huh?

51:54.519 --> 51:57.488
Yeah, big bang.

52:06.665 --> 52:08.326
'Nelius...

52:15.607 --> 52:18.474
...you are a corrupt,
depraved drunkard.

52:18.643 --> 52:20.110
True.

52:20.278 --> 52:25.682
- This weakness I overlook.
- The General is compassionate.

52:27.018 --> 52:32.115
Your employer, Mr. Stein,
conspires against me.

52:32.290 --> 52:35.054
- A sentimental gesture.
- Supported by new rifles.

52:35.226 --> 52:38.889
- Harmless, where they are.
- They are here.

52:39.064 --> 52:43.865
- Impossible.
- Possible, probable, actual, here.

52:44.035 --> 52:46.503
And you know it.

52:47.439 --> 52:49.498
For disloyalty, I kill.

52:50.942 --> 52:53.001
Disloyal to you?

52:59.384 --> 53:03.047
You already betray
the people of Patusan.

53:06.091 --> 53:08.355
Why not me?

53:08.526 --> 53:14.260
Because you are supremely powerful,
and I am incredibly selfish.

53:14.466 --> 53:18.061
That makes me
your most loyal subject.

53:36.621 --> 53:38.282
Cut.

54:46.825 --> 54:50.591
- Can we bury this one?
- They cremate their dead.

54:51.162 --> 54:53.426
Chief Du-Ramin was told?

54:53.598 --> 54:55.623
This morning, sir!

54:56.134 --> 54:59.433
When their women bring food,
they will take him away.

55:54.893 --> 55:57.157
Hey, General...

56:23.288 --> 56:25.188
Chop, chop, chop.

57:12.570 --> 57:15.630
Father, please stay in the house.

58:13.331 --> 58:14.992
Thank you.

58:17.068 --> 58:20.504
What hostility brings you here?

58:20.671 --> 58:24.835
- Politics?
- Business for Mr. Stein.

58:25.009 --> 58:26.977
I like men of business.

58:28.346 --> 58:31.509
We have a common language:
Money.

58:31.682 --> 58:34.583
You sell munitions, I buy.

58:34.786 --> 58:36.549
They're gone.

58:37.021 --> 58:39.819
Blown up. Exploded.

58:42.427 --> 58:44.793
One explosion.

58:50.868 --> 58:54.031
You bring nine separate
barrels of powder.

58:54.205 --> 58:57.606
So there should be
many separate explosions.

58:57.809 --> 58:59.401
Correct?

58:59.577 --> 59:01.238
Correct.

59:05.516 --> 59:08.679
You have two paths.
First path, we trade.

59:08.853 --> 59:14.450
You give rifles and powder,
I give a boat...

59:14.892 --> 59:18.419
...and freedom.
- And the second path?

59:19.230 --> 59:24.964
It leads to the same place,
only not so pleasant.

59:25.870 --> 59:27.531
Torture.

59:28.739 --> 59:30.536
Persuasion.

59:31.442 --> 59:33.376
Can all men...

59:33.711 --> 59:35.338
...be persuaded?

59:40.952 --> 59:42.920
All.

59:58.436 --> 01:00:00.063
And if it is too late?

01:00:00.238 --> 01:00:02.832
He may have told them
where he put the weapons.

01:00:03.007 --> 01:00:05.805
Then they would not
still be searching.

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:09.105
And while they search, we must wait.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.511
That is why we must act swiftly.

01:00:12.884 --> 01:00:14.943
And the dead prisoner...

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:18.179
...is it proper
to use his body this way?

01:00:19.123 --> 01:00:21.785
If the dead can serve the living...

01:00:21.959 --> 01:00:23.620
...yes.

01:01:31.562 --> 01:01:34.554
In spite of overwhelming odds,
you made a noble effort.

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:36.393
No, please, don't deny it.

01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:41.231
What did the General call it?
"Gallant. Admirable."

01:01:41.405 --> 01:01:45.000
Self-sacrifice for one's own kind,
yes, understandable.

01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:49.544
Why suffer excruciating agony
if you have to submit anyway?

01:01:49.714 --> 01:01:53.275
And for whom?
For the glory of the trading company?

01:01:53.484 --> 01:01:59.582
Look at me. Eight years of loyal service
in this godforsaken hellhole.

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:02.188
Deserted, forgotten.

01:02:02.693 --> 01:02:05.457
No gratitude, no respect...

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:07.598
...no future.

01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:10.764
Be sensible.

01:02:10.935 --> 01:02:13.028
Think of yourself.

01:02:13.704 --> 01:02:16.935
- I am.
- Capital.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:21.943
I'll see you have first-class treatment.
You can depend on it. Right?

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.809
Now, tell me, where is it?

01:02:25.016 --> 01:02:27.644
Where did you hide the rifles?

01:02:27.818 --> 01:02:30.719
- What about them?
- Who?

01:02:30.888 --> 01:02:32.549
Them.

01:02:35.726 --> 01:02:37.421
Nothing can save them.

01:02:37.828 --> 01:02:41.229
Tomorrow morning,
they are finished...

01:02:41.399 --> 01:02:44.596
...as a nation, as a people.

01:02:44.769 --> 01:02:47.169
Down the drain,
gone without a trace.

01:02:48.105 --> 01:02:51.836
- Like a sinking ship.
- Exactly. Done for.

01:02:52.043 --> 01:02:54.944
With our without your weapons,
done for.

01:02:55.112 --> 01:02:57.171
In that case...

01:02:58.049 --> 01:03:00.244
...why all the fuss?

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:09.691
You don't even know them.

01:03:10.061 --> 01:03:11.358
Why?

01:03:40.458 --> 01:03:44.485
Have you ever considered
what makes pain unbearable?

01:03:44.662 --> 01:03:47.995
One thing. The brain.

01:03:51.535 --> 01:03:57.997
Put the brain to sleep,
and the flesh can be burned, torn...

01:03:58.175 --> 01:04:01.372
...twisted, chopped without pain.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.511
Awaken the brain...

01:04:04.682 --> 01:04:06.411
...anticipate pain...

01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:14.315
...then every touch, sight, sound...

01:04:14.492 --> 01:04:16.687
...becomes exaggerated.

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:19.621
Mind betrays the body.

01:04:20.498 --> 01:04:24.025
And finally,
the pain becomes unbearable.

01:04:24.368 --> 01:04:26.097
Nothing to say?

01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:29.501
You think silence is strength.

01:04:29.774 --> 01:04:31.435
Wrong.

01:04:31.909 --> 01:04:35.743
A man's strength is relative
to his imagination.

01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:39.849
The more imagination,
the less resistance.

01:04:41.385 --> 01:04:44.252
For God's sake, tell him. Tell him.

01:04:45.222 --> 01:04:48.783
They'll never know you spoke,
so there's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:04:48.959 --> 01:04:51.951
Never test another man
by your own weakness.

01:04:53.664 --> 01:04:55.529
Science bores you?

01:04:56.934 --> 01:04:58.595
This?

01:05:02.239 --> 01:05:04.469
No man is a stranger to fear.

01:05:04.675 --> 01:05:07.803
Fear is the perfect tool
for persuasion.

01:05:07.978 --> 01:05:09.377
Now...

01:05:09.547 --> 01:05:14.041
...what do you fear most?
What do you prize most?

01:05:14.218 --> 01:05:19.155
Your strong, young body?
Your manhood?

01:05:19.323 --> 01:05:21.086
Your eyesight?

01:05:22.593 --> 01:05:27.428
What could make you cheat a friend,
forsake honor...

01:05:27.898 --> 01:05:30.458
...desert a post of duty?

01:05:31.969 --> 01:05:35.632
What fear could turn you
into a coward?

01:07:11.302 --> 01:07:12.826
Interesting man.

01:07:21.345 --> 01:07:23.336
I hate him.

01:07:23.514 --> 01:07:28.178
Naturally. He endured
where you could not.

01:07:28.719 --> 01:07:30.243
You should have killed him.

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:33.822
He knew I would not kill him,
not until...

01:07:36.193 --> 01:07:38.354
Of course.

01:07:38.529 --> 01:07:40.394
He knew!

01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:55.600
For one hour,
he is not to be molested.

01:07:55.779 --> 01:07:57.542
Attend his comfort.

01:07:58.082 --> 01:08:00.550
Indulge your senses.

01:08:00.718 --> 01:08:02.083
Feel life.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:07.557
Eat, smoke, dream, make love.

01:08:07.725 --> 01:08:11.855
If he wishes privacy with her, permit.

01:08:13.764 --> 01:08:15.425
Look.

01:08:16.433 --> 01:08:18.127
The essence of pleasure.

01:08:18.569 --> 01:08:22.562
Warm, sweet, ripe.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.767
A woman can satisfy all your senses
at the same time.

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:29.973
She is the only reality.

01:08:30.147 --> 01:08:32.171
She is life.

01:08:32.416 --> 01:08:35.613
Death is the end of all things real.

01:08:35.786 --> 01:08:40.154
It is the end of all feeling,
desire, hope.

01:08:40.957 --> 01:08:44.291
Death is nothingness.

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:50.964
And that is what
you fear most. Death.

01:08:51.801 --> 01:08:56.466
Not pain, but oblivion.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:05.941
In one hour, I will ask
for the weapons.

01:09:09.787 --> 01:09:12.312
I will ask but once.

01:09:12.488 --> 01:09:16.788
If you refuse, if you lie...

01:09:17.161 --> 01:09:19.152
...oblivion.

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:22.157
One hour.

01:09:30.974 --> 01:09:35.171
Do you believe that death
is the end of everything?

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:37.680
Oblivion?

01:09:44.054 --> 01:09:45.919
I believe you must leave here...

01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:48.149
...before you learn the answer.

01:09:59.703 --> 01:10:04.504
Then why not save
one of your own people?

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:07.070
You, they will chase.

01:10:07.244 --> 01:10:09.235
And while they hunt for you...

01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:11.404
...we will get the weapons.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.712
Sorry.

01:10:18.255 --> 01:10:21.554
I don't mind being chased.

01:10:21.725 --> 01:10:25.126
But I'd like not to get caught.

01:10:31.702 --> 01:10:33.465
If you hesitate...

01:10:33.637 --> 01:10:35.468
...we fail.

01:10:35.639 --> 01:10:39.040
If you move too soon, we fail.

01:10:39.376 --> 01:10:43.312
If the moon comes out too soon,
we fail.

01:10:44.381 --> 01:10:47.316
Each thing must be exact.

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:01.725
Cigarette?

01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:10.131
A nice, fresh, long one, please.

01:11:10.774 --> 01:11:12.969
Full of life.

01:11:18.982 --> 01:11:21.780
You're the one on the boat...

01:11:22.352 --> 01:11:24.115
...and the fire.

01:11:26.089 --> 01:11:28.819
You know, if you'd done
a proper job of sabotage...

01:11:28.992 --> 01:11:31.859
...neither of us would be in this mess,
would we?

01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:09.325
Now, mister...

01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:48.731
I thought it was him.

01:12:54.711 --> 01:12:56.645
Find him.

01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:03.613
One moment, please.

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.340
To pray for a dead soul.

01:14:06.516 --> 01:14:10.577
Come, I shall pray for you also.

01:14:43.653 --> 01:14:45.678
Hey. Hey!

01:15:23.493 --> 01:15:27.691
We found the body of the
dead prisoner at the monastery.

01:15:27.864 --> 01:15:30.355
That is how the Englishman escape.

01:15:30.534 --> 01:15:33.162
Chain them with the prisoners.

01:15:35.172 --> 01:15:36.537
What's it mean?

01:15:36.706 --> 01:15:42.235
That the Englishman is safe with them.
That means they have the weapons.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.913
And that means...

01:15:46.516 --> 01:15:48.381
...armed resistance.

01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:50.553
Now we can resist.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.848
To resist is not enough.

01:15:55.058 --> 01:15:57.026
If this becomes the battleground...

01:15:57.227 --> 01:16:00.526
...your women and children
become the first casualties.

01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:04.689
We have 10 rifles,
they have a hundred.

01:16:05.135 --> 01:16:10.232
Ours are better weapons,
but they have unlimited bullets.

01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:16.371
According to Mr. Stein,
you have a cannon, a six-pounder.

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:21.711
Yes, but not fired for many years,
buried in some old ruins.

01:16:21.985 --> 01:16:24.249
It's useless there.

01:16:24.721 --> 01:16:29.454
But if we place it here in the village,
it brings the stockade within range.

01:16:29.659 --> 01:16:31.422
You think the General will wait?

01:16:31.595 --> 01:16:34.223
His men will sweep
over us like locusts.

01:16:34.397 --> 01:16:35.989
But...

01:16:38.168 --> 01:16:41.399
...if we can keep them locked
in their own stockade...

01:16:41.571 --> 01:16:43.232
...and at the same time...

01:16:43.406 --> 01:16:47.399
...if we can destroy
the ammunition dump with a cannon...

01:16:47.577 --> 01:16:51.479
...if we can attack on their ground...

01:16:51.948 --> 01:16:56.112
...if we can keep them inside,
on the defensive...

01:16:57.621 --> 01:17:01.990
...if we can be ready
by tomorrow's sunrise...

01:17:02.926 --> 01:17:05.019
...then perhaps...

01:17:06.696 --> 01:17:08.493
...we might win.
- Lf.

01:17:08.665 --> 01:17:10.462
The night is too short for ifs!

01:17:10.834 --> 01:17:14.099
To take human life is a sin
against Buddha.

01:17:14.604 --> 01:17:16.265
Can peaceful farmers be made...

01:17:16.439 --> 01:17:18.532
...into an army in one night?
- Yes!

01:17:18.775 --> 01:17:23.439
- Begin before we talk the night away.
- Can you use an old artilleryman?

01:17:24.414 --> 01:17:26.314
Now we can fight.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.017
Looks peaceful to me.

01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:32.984
Too peaceful.

01:17:47.137 --> 01:17:49.867
- What about these? Will they fire?
- Yes...

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:53.237
...if there was something to fire.

01:17:53.443 --> 01:17:58.380
Bits of iron, nails, broken glass.

01:17:58.582 --> 01:18:01.847
Why wait? Attack! Now!

01:18:02.018 --> 01:18:06.250
- Do their spears frighten you?
- Fools frighten me.

01:18:06.456 --> 01:18:08.856
Would you lead an attack
by torchlight...

01:18:09.025 --> 01:18:12.358
...with 500 spears
waiting in the darkness?

01:18:12.562 --> 01:18:16.157
There is the margin of victory.
Firepower.

01:18:16.366 --> 01:18:18.357
Yes, yes.

01:18:18.535 --> 01:18:20.400
We will slaughter them.

01:18:20.604 --> 01:18:23.664
Yes, yes, but will we defeat them?

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:28.610
Rockets, like fireworks. Many.

01:18:33.216 --> 01:18:34.774
This kite...

01:19:00.443 --> 01:19:04.402
When the sun rises, be ready.

01:19:59.669 --> 01:20:02.502
- You're not well.
- I'm fine.

01:20:03.373 --> 01:20:05.136
- We have far to go.
- Women.

01:20:05.308 --> 01:20:08.334
- Not a job for...
- lf we can plough a field...

01:20:08.678 --> 01:20:10.942
...we can pull a cannon.

01:21:38.234 --> 01:21:40.225
- Everything go as planned?
- Yes.

01:21:40.403 --> 01:21:43.804
- You didn't forget the bamboo poles?
- Everything as planned.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.736
He will need someone
to lead the way.

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:49.370
- Lf you see a kite flying?
- We fire.

01:21:49.546 --> 01:21:51.980
And keep firing till you hit
the blockhouse.

01:21:52.182 --> 01:21:55.879
- Lf that ammunition dump explodes?
- We have won.

01:21:56.386 --> 01:21:58.047
Ruon.

01:21:58.721 --> 01:22:02.213
- Lf we send up a white rocket?
- Our shot is too long.

01:22:02.392 --> 01:22:05.793
- A red one?
- Means we are short.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.397
I know not why...

01:22:12.569 --> 01:22:16.630
...you've made our cause yours, but...
- Does it matter?

01:22:16.806 --> 01:22:19.832
It matters that you risk
your life for us.

01:22:20.009 --> 01:22:21.476
No.

01:22:21.644 --> 01:22:23.441
Goodbye, sir.

01:22:25.815 --> 01:22:28.909
God go with you...

01:22:29.085 --> 01:22:30.643
...Tuan Jim.

01:22:35.525 --> 01:22:37.516
What's it mean...

01:22:38.228 --> 01:22:40.287
..."Tuan Jim"?

01:22:40.463 --> 01:22:42.863
A Tuan is a man of bravery...

01:22:43.032 --> 01:22:45.159
...a man to respect.

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:47.132
A lord.

01:22:47.303 --> 01:22:50.966
Yes. "Lord Jim."

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.115
- For my mother.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:23:00.683 --> 01:23:03.447
Why should you sorrow
for the dead?

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:07.688
What lives once lives forever.

01:23:10.193 --> 01:23:13.788
Many people wait here
to be purified by fire.

01:23:14.264 --> 01:23:18.200
Only then can their souls
be freed from their bodies.

01:23:18.368 --> 01:23:22.236
A proper funeral should have
music and dancing...

01:23:22.405 --> 01:23:27.809
...and fine gifts for the gods
and beautiful painted towers to burn.

01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:31.374
But it is very, very expensive.

01:23:32.181 --> 01:23:36.242
So we wait for a rich man
to die, and then...

01:23:36.419 --> 01:23:40.412
...we quickly bring out our dead
and join the cremation.

01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:44.219
It is a happy time when so many souls
come back to us.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:49.195
One day, my mother's soul
will return to a new life...

01:23:49.365 --> 01:23:51.196
...sweet and bitter as the old...

01:23:51.367 --> 01:23:55.895
...but one step closer to perfection.

01:24:10.687 --> 01:24:13.247
The sign of the true believer.

01:24:13.856 --> 01:24:18.623
You wear the Jesus medal,
yet you beseech Buddha.

01:24:18.828 --> 01:24:24.630
Last week, it was Mohammed.
Before that, Confucius.

01:24:24.834 --> 01:24:26.802
I was lonely.

01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:30.098
At times like this,
I can't stand to be alone.

01:24:31.274 --> 01:24:33.970
Besides, I always did
believe in God.

01:24:34.911 --> 01:24:37.436
In your mouth, that is blasphemy.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:40.139
What do you think of before a battle?

01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:44.377
Killing? Death? God? A woman!

01:24:44.554 --> 01:24:47.580
I think only of what
the enemy is thinking.

01:24:47.757 --> 01:24:52.126
- And you?
- Oh, I feel a griping pain here.

01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:55.230
Probably something I ate.

01:24:55.398 --> 01:24:59.129
Probably a precious stone, perhaps.

01:24:59.302 --> 01:25:01.930
Like all things great and small...

01:25:02.105 --> 01:25:03.902
...it will pass.

01:25:04.073 --> 01:25:06.473
And when it does...

01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:08.736
...give it back.

01:25:22.025 --> 01:25:25.791
- The cannon. Is it ready?
- It is in position.

01:25:28.431 --> 01:25:32.697
Its always there, waiting for us.
Waiting...

01:25:32.902 --> 01:25:35.803
Its always there. Fear.

01:25:36.005 --> 01:25:40.135
Why didn't you run, hide, crawl 20 feet
underground where you belong?

01:25:40.343 --> 01:25:41.708
- What about them?
- Who?

01:25:42.412 --> 01:25:45.677
- Them!
- Theyre dead! Finished!

01:25:45.848 --> 01:25:50.114
- Nothing can save them.
- Jump! Jump! Jump!

01:26:08.004 --> 01:26:12.134
- I will go now.
- Wait! Please.

01:26:12.308 --> 01:26:16.005
I need some help with this.

01:26:17.447 --> 01:26:20.382
Count by ones.

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.319
- Now!
- One, two...

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.954
...three, four...

01:26:27.156 --> 01:26:29.920
...five, six...

01:26:30.093 --> 01:26:32.084
...seven.
- Seven.

01:26:51.347 --> 01:26:54.043
That man, what did he want?

01:26:55.184 --> 01:26:58.244
What does a child want
when it cries in the dark?

01:26:59.789 --> 01:27:03.589
At a time like this, most of us...

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.694
...are afraid.

01:27:05.862 --> 01:27:07.625
Not you.

01:27:08.097 --> 01:27:09.792
Oh, yes.

01:27:10.399 --> 01:27:12.526
I know what they did.

01:27:12.702 --> 01:27:14.567
You told them nothing.

01:27:14.737 --> 01:27:18.434
Next time, I would have
told them everything.

01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:26.271
The General is a persuasive man.

01:27:27.016 --> 01:27:30.543
He knows human nature.
String, please.

01:27:32.088 --> 01:27:35.751
He knew how much I wanted you.

01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:42.259
Would you have given yourself?

01:27:45.735 --> 01:27:47.464
Yes.

01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:49.832
Because of fear?

01:27:50.039 --> 01:27:52.132
Because it was necessary.

01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:55.073
It is only what we do,
what we think...

01:27:55.978 --> 01:27:58.412
...that makes us unclean.

01:27:59.348 --> 01:28:04.081
At sunrise, we invade Patusan.
Resistance is expected.

01:28:04.253 --> 01:28:07.279
Consequently, you will go in front.

01:28:07.456 --> 01:28:10.482
You will form a human wall...

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:13.754
...a shield to protect my men.

01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:17.832
Therefore, ask them not to resist.

01:28:19.802 --> 01:28:22.965
Your lives depend
upon the mercy of your brothers.

01:28:23.172 --> 01:28:25.470
At sunrise, then.

01:28:45.828 --> 01:28:49.696
Will the gods be on our side today?

01:28:50.867 --> 01:28:55.395
- Do you wish me to pray for you?
- I already have.

01:28:55.605 --> 01:28:59.166
That is good. To which god?

01:29:00.243 --> 01:29:03.508
We have only one god.

01:29:04.647 --> 01:29:06.205
That is unfortunate.

01:29:06.415 --> 01:29:09.350
There is too much work
for one god, no?

01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:38.493
Go. Go!

01:33:28.911 --> 01:33:30.606
Why didn't you keep firing?

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.275
I cannot...

01:34:45.554 --> 01:34:48.580
Tuan, attack! Attack!

01:34:48.757 --> 01:34:50.588
Fight!

01:36:26.822 --> 01:36:29.347
If we try now, too many die.

01:36:29.758 --> 01:36:32.955
- When it's dark.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:36:34.363 --> 01:36:38.094
No chains. No chains.

01:36:39.168 --> 01:36:42.262
Thank you. No chains.

01:36:42.671 --> 01:36:45.538
All the fuses must be lighted
at the same time.

01:36:45.708 --> 01:36:49.610
All the spears must be thrown
at the same time.

01:37:00.022 --> 01:37:02.490
- What are you waiting for?
- Darkness.

01:37:02.658 --> 01:37:04.523
And then?

01:37:05.461 --> 01:37:07.486
Escape.

01:37:07.663 --> 01:37:10.962
The tunnel!
From there, under the walls.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.859
Ingenious!

01:37:14.236 --> 01:37:16.329
General, I salute you.

01:37:16.538 --> 01:37:19.336
We are much more alike
than I thought.

01:37:19.508 --> 01:37:22.909
An escape hatch for all of us.

01:37:23.312 --> 01:37:24.870
Not all.

01:37:25.047 --> 01:37:28.881
Oh, yes. Too bad, yes.

01:37:29.051 --> 01:37:32.043
Some are destined to fight
to the very end.

01:37:32.221 --> 01:37:34.985
A glorious death.

01:37:35.424 --> 01:37:37.255
Gentlemen...

01:37:37.659 --> 01:37:40.924
For what would you
be willing to die?

01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:44.991
- Willing?
- Certainly not honor.

01:37:45.868 --> 01:37:47.597
Love?

01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:49.738
Power?

01:37:50.139 --> 01:37:52.767
Perhaps this treasure?

01:44:00.509 --> 01:44:02.500
I...

01:44:03.145 --> 01:44:05.306
...didn't know where else to go.

01:44:05.514 --> 01:44:09.245
You are welcome everywhere,
but here is your home.

01:44:09.417 --> 01:44:11.044
You?

01:44:15.090 --> 01:44:17.081
My mother.

01:44:19.027 --> 01:44:21.154
The man is my father.

01:44:21.329 --> 01:44:23.126
He came here for Mr. Stein.

01:44:23.899 --> 01:44:25.924
I remember him...

01:44:26.234 --> 01:44:29.135
...as a golden god.

01:44:31.606 --> 01:44:34.234
My mother worshiped him...

01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:38.405
...loved him even as she died.

01:44:40.182 --> 01:44:42.776
I was born in this house.

01:44:43.819 --> 01:44:47.084
We had many happy times together...

01:44:47.455 --> 01:44:49.150
...until one day...

01:44:50.258 --> 01:44:52.590
...the golden god ran away.

01:44:54.129 --> 01:44:58.657
Perhaps, after all, he was not a god.

01:44:59.134 --> 01:45:03.127
Mr. Stein sends other men.

01:45:03.305 --> 01:45:07.799
They promise never to leave us,
like my father.

01:45:08.143 --> 01:45:12.011
But always, they dream
of someplace else.

01:45:12.781 --> 01:45:14.840
Always...

01:45:16.017 --> 01:45:20.351
...something pulled them away.
Always, they leave.

01:45:20.989 --> 01:45:22.854
You too.

01:45:23.024 --> 01:45:27.586
You will go away, back.
Yes, back to your own kind.

01:45:33.802 --> 01:45:35.235
I won't go back.

01:45:36.104 --> 01:45:38.334
One day, a letter will come.

01:45:38.506 --> 01:45:44.911
Or the whiskey soda will remind you
of a woman, a dream, a memory.

01:45:45.113 --> 01:45:49.174
- Something will make you leave.
- Do you want me to stay?

01:45:52.854 --> 01:45:54.344
Everyone will be honored.

01:45:56.157 --> 01:45:59.058
Do you want me to stay?

01:46:08.837 --> 01:46:10.498
No.

01:46:11.907 --> 01:46:14.000
Only because...

01:46:14.242 --> 01:46:17.006
...I do not wish to die weeping...

01:46:17.445 --> 01:46:18.776
...like my mother.

01:46:26.521 --> 01:46:28.682
You see?

01:46:29.391 --> 01:46:32.019
It is already too late.

01:46:35.563 --> 01:46:37.360
Then I might as well stay.

01:46:42.904 --> 01:46:44.701
I'll never go...

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.908
Never is forever.

01:46:49.077 --> 01:46:53.207
Let us try to live one day at a time.

01:47:27.849 --> 01:47:33.947
At least 10 wooden chests filled with
money. Worth 50,000, maybe more.

01:47:34.122 --> 01:47:37.182
A gallon of stones worth
who knows how much.

01:47:37.359 --> 01:47:39.953
- Ours for the taking.
- Why didn't you take them?

01:47:40.128 --> 01:47:43.859
By myself?
I could have managed a handful...

01:47:44.032 --> 01:47:48.935
...but with your engine boat,
we get it all like a breeze.

01:47:49.104 --> 01:47:51.436
That easy, eh?

01:47:51.606 --> 01:47:54.040
Kill one man, becomes easy.

01:47:54.676 --> 01:47:58.237
Well, personally, I'm not
a man for killing. Are you?

01:47:59.781 --> 01:48:03.615
So we need a specialist
in these matters.

01:48:06.287 --> 01:48:08.721
The captain of this ship is...

01:48:08.890 --> 01:48:11.723
Did you ever hear
of Gentleman Brown?

01:48:11.893 --> 01:48:14.862
For this, we don't want
any gentleman.

01:48:16.064 --> 01:48:17.827
This gentleman, Captain Brown...

01:48:17.999 --> 01:48:21.992
...has given more business to death
than the bubonic plague.

01:48:22.203 --> 01:48:24.569
From Java to Fiji...

01:48:24.773 --> 01:48:29.335
...he's wanted for piracy,
for slavery, for mutiny...

01:48:29.511 --> 01:48:35.882
...for rape, murder, even some things
that are not mentioned in the Bible.

01:48:36.418 --> 01:48:39.012
- You were saying?
- On the day of the festival...

01:48:39.187 --> 01:48:41.849
...Patusan will be like
a wild and noisy carnival.

01:48:42.023 --> 01:48:43.217
- Tea?
- Thank you.

01:48:43.391 --> 01:48:46.224
We can be in and out
before they know what hit them.

01:48:46.394 --> 01:48:49.886
If an army couldn't take this money,
what makes you think we can?

01:48:50.065 --> 01:48:51.930
The General was too ambitious.

01:48:52.367 --> 01:48:55.063
All we have to do is...

01:48:55.503 --> 01:48:57.869
...eliminate a certain person.

01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:01.033
You mean murder?

01:49:01.209 --> 01:49:03.200
Justice.

01:49:03.411 --> 01:49:05.811
Kill one pompous fool and...

01:49:06.014 --> 01:49:10.542
Let's see, now. You're out,
he's in, but he's the fool.

01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:18.081
- Could I have whiskey, please, captain?
- Did you bring some with you?

01:49:21.763 --> 01:49:25.859
Now, where is this gold kept?
Is it guarded?

01:49:26.034 --> 01:49:28.969
If so, how? And by whom?

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.603
How do I know I can trust you?

01:49:41.116 --> 01:49:43.710
You don't know.

01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:53.156
- What do you think?
- I'm a silent partner.

01:49:53.361 --> 01:49:58.958
Well, I suppose we have to take
each other's word as gentlemen.

01:50:00.902 --> 01:50:02.597
I suppose.

01:51:44.906 --> 01:51:46.703
Fine.

01:52:00.088 --> 01:52:06.049
If we can cut a canal from here to the
river, we can ship 30 percent more tin.

01:52:06.261 --> 01:52:08.752
Fifty percent if you had machines.

01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:10.363
But that takes much money.

01:52:11.132 --> 01:52:13.293
- Are you still against money?
- No, sir.

01:52:13.501 --> 01:52:15.731
- Good.
- With machines...

01:52:15.903 --> 01:52:19.361
...we could build a dam,
which would give us two rice crops.

01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:21.098
Wait a minute. Not so fast.

01:52:21.276 --> 01:52:23.301
This is still their land...

01:52:23.511 --> 01:52:26.969
...their future. They must decide.
- They have.

01:52:27.148 --> 01:52:30.606
Waris, his father, the people.
Full approval.

01:52:30.785 --> 01:52:33.618
Do they understand
what they are approving?

01:52:33.788 --> 01:52:37.417
Not entirely. I gave them my word.

01:52:37.592 --> 01:52:39.651
Seemed to be enough.

01:52:40.428 --> 01:52:45.297
I see. Well,
this project is practical, yes.

01:52:45.533 --> 01:52:47.831
It takes only one thing
to make it workable.

01:52:48.036 --> 01:52:49.128
Well, then.

01:52:49.304 --> 01:52:52.034
All you must do is kill
an evil phantom.

01:52:53.474 --> 01:52:59.504
Let's see now, you can't kill a ghost
with a bullet or a spear.

01:52:59.681 --> 01:53:01.649
Black magic?

01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:03.942
The weapon is truth.

01:53:14.429 --> 01:53:16.329
You know.

01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:26.573
That phantom's been
with me a long time.

01:53:27.442 --> 01:53:31.936
- It won't die.
- No, son. Not in the dark.

01:53:33.381 --> 01:53:38.216
- But if you bring it out into the open...
- You expect me to tell them?

01:53:40.688 --> 01:53:42.622
Why?

01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:45.850
The stink of the Patna
belongs to another world.

01:53:46.094 --> 01:53:48.528
There is only one world.

01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:53.324
The long arm of this trading company
has reached across 10,000 miles...

01:53:53.501 --> 01:53:58.063
...right here into your hiding place.
This is from Amsterdam.

01:53:58.239 --> 01:54:01.174
"Your request for Jim,
alias James, Burke...

01:54:01.342 --> 01:54:05.005
...to represent us
in Patusan is denied."

01:54:05.613 --> 01:54:11.347
But let Chief Du-Ramin insist on Jim,
as he will, and I'll back you all the way.

01:54:11.519 --> 01:54:14.647
But no secrets.
Everybody, eyes open.

01:54:14.822 --> 01:54:16.687
Then, if anything happens again...

01:54:20.128 --> 01:54:21.686
I meant...

01:54:21.863 --> 01:54:25.321
You meant exactly what you said.

01:54:26.567 --> 01:54:28.728
You know the truth.

01:54:28.903 --> 01:54:32.066
- Can you trust me?
- I did.

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:35.505
Then. Before you knew.

01:54:35.676 --> 01:54:37.769
What about now?

01:54:38.646 --> 01:54:42.082
Just now, you were thinking,
"lt'll happen again.

01:54:42.683 --> 01:54:47.552
Tomorrow, the next day,
when there's dirty weather. Watch out.

01:54:47.722 --> 01:54:52.557
He'll slip, turn coward, jump."

01:54:52.727 --> 01:54:55.787
You expect it to happen.

01:54:56.697 --> 01:55:02.192
It'll always be there,
the doubt. Waiting.

01:55:07.408 --> 01:55:11.469
You have visitors
of much importance.

01:55:22.957 --> 01:55:28.725
Now you are one of us,
it is proper to become family.

01:55:29.263 --> 01:55:31.458
My mama.

01:55:31.632 --> 01:55:33.964
Her mama.

01:55:34.435 --> 01:55:35.902
Her mama.

01:55:37.839 --> 01:55:42.799
We hope for you to happy.

01:56:03.231 --> 01:56:04.528
They respect you.

01:56:06.334 --> 01:56:09.132
We respect each other.

01:56:09.604 --> 01:56:11.697
Enough to share a secret with them?

01:56:11.873 --> 01:56:13.670
Not that one.

01:56:15.243 --> 01:56:17.939
You won't even tell the girl?

01:56:18.346 --> 01:56:20.246
No.

01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:26.884
If she can trust you with her love,
if they can trust you with their faith...

01:56:27.054 --> 01:56:30.353
...why can't you trust them
with the truth?

01:56:30.992 --> 01:56:34.223
Did you take a look
at them out there?

01:56:34.395 --> 01:56:36.522
A good look?

01:56:36.964 --> 01:56:39.524
Do you know what they felt?

01:56:40.401 --> 01:56:43.529
What I feel right now?

01:56:45.506 --> 01:56:49.670
The trust in their eyes
means more...

01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:55.477
You think I want to see
in their eyes what I see in yours?

01:56:55.883 --> 01:56:59.649
I earned their respect,
and you want me to...

01:56:59.854 --> 01:57:02.823
No. I can't.

01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:08.519
I won't. I cannot tell them
and stay here, and I'm staying.

01:57:08.696 --> 01:57:12.154
Whether I work for you or not,
I'm staying.

01:57:12.333 --> 01:57:18.738
Now, if you want to tell them about me,
go ahead. Just go ahead.

01:57:21.876 --> 01:57:24.606
You gave me this chance.

01:57:25.446 --> 01:57:28.244
Don't ask me to throw it away.

01:57:28.583 --> 01:57:30.608
Not now.

01:57:36.524 --> 01:57:39.357
You know, the time of the harvest...

01:57:39.527 --> 01:57:42.257
...is a season for gifts.

01:57:42.697 --> 01:57:48.135
An ancient custom
invented by me just now.

01:57:48.469 --> 01:57:50.630
For your collection.

01:57:51.138 --> 01:57:57.566
According to Professor Stein,
rare, exact specimens.

01:58:00.114 --> 01:58:02.241
Perfect.

01:58:04.452 --> 01:58:06.420
We are only what God made us.

01:58:07.455 --> 01:58:09.423
Nothing more.

01:58:34.515 --> 01:58:37.006
Drunk, you're useless and unreliable.

01:58:37.251 --> 01:58:41.119
- Sober, he's the same.
- Tell me about his man Jim.

01:58:42.323 --> 01:58:47.124
- I told you 20 times.
- Start again. From the beginning.

01:59:30.071 --> 01:59:31.732
Tuan!

02:01:11.605 --> 02:01:12.936
Ruon!

02:02:40.327 --> 02:02:43.558
- It's the lascar, hurt bad.
- Leave him.

02:02:59.413 --> 02:03:03.008
He sounds terrible.
I think he'll die slow and painful.

02:03:03.183 --> 02:03:06.016
- They should put him out of his misery.
- One bullet.

02:03:06.186 --> 02:03:08.051
An act of compassion?

02:03:08.222 --> 02:03:11.020
Good for us, bad for him.

02:03:29.209 --> 02:03:34.237
Please, please do not let me die.

02:03:38.886 --> 02:03:40.979
Ahoy.

02:03:41.188 --> 02:03:43.315
Ahoy there.

02:03:43.958 --> 02:03:45.482
This is Captain Brown.

02:03:45.759 --> 02:03:48.125
- Is it Duncan Brown?
- Yes, sir.

02:03:48.295 --> 02:03:51.423
Gentleman Duncan Malcolm Brown
at your service.

02:03:51.699 --> 02:03:55.328
- What do you want?
- A truce.

02:03:55.502 --> 02:03:58.232
I'm prepared to discuss terms...

02:03:58.405 --> 02:04:04.275
...but only in private and with the white
man, the one they call "Lord Jim."

02:04:04.578 --> 02:04:06.842
Him alone. No other.

02:04:08.315 --> 02:04:11.842
- Is it a truce or not?
- Ignore him.

02:04:12.219 --> 02:04:14.210
How do you ignore a fact?

02:04:19.226 --> 02:04:22.093
Well? Yes or no?

02:04:30.004 --> 02:04:31.869
Yes!

02:04:39.113 --> 02:04:40.808
Jim.

02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:45.445
I'd use it.

02:05:08.008 --> 02:05:11.466
Yes, I think his majesty
has pretensions to heroism...

02:05:11.645 --> 02:05:15.137
...a form of mental disease
induced by vanity.

02:05:15.682 --> 02:05:18.651
Kill him. Just one shot.

02:05:19.086 --> 02:05:23.284
You have a natural talent
for disaster.

02:05:24.291 --> 02:05:27.021
Try to improve yourself
into an ordinary failure...

02:05:27.194 --> 02:05:29.719
...by keeping your mouth shut.

02:06:02.229 --> 02:06:04.891
My lord, it's a privilege
and an honor.

02:06:07.134 --> 02:06:10.592
Yes, well, what a waste...

02:06:10.771 --> 02:06:14.730
...to risk so much on the drunken
fantasies of the idiot Cornelius.

02:06:15.275 --> 02:06:17.766
Pure folly on my part.

02:06:17.945 --> 02:06:21.108
You, my lord,
what brought you to lotus land?

02:06:24.551 --> 02:06:28.647
A weapon may seem
inconsistent with a truce...

02:06:28.856 --> 02:06:32.348
...but habit...
Hunted men are creatures of caution.

02:06:33.227 --> 02:06:37.357
Yes. Fired in self-defense.

02:06:39.233 --> 02:06:42.066
Someone close to you was hurt?

02:06:44.138 --> 02:06:45.469
Murdered.

02:06:47.407 --> 02:06:51.241
The wounded lascar we left in your
own personal care was like my own...

02:06:51.411 --> 02:06:52.969
...and only sweet son.

02:06:53.647 --> 02:06:55.274
You let him die.

02:06:55.449 --> 02:06:59.385
And there you are.
The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh...

02:07:01.622 --> 02:07:05.683
Now, what's our situation?
We have two choices.

02:07:06.093 --> 02:07:10.462
One, you give us our boats, accept
our apology, we leave peacefully.

02:07:10.631 --> 02:07:13.327
Choice two, we fight.

02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:15.695
- You'd lose.
- Granted.

02:07:15.903 --> 02:07:20.431
But in all good conscience, my lord,
is it worth even one innocent life...

02:07:20.607 --> 02:07:24.771
...merely to remove worthless rabble,
riffraff, like myself...

02:07:24.945 --> 02:07:28.278
...who one day will die
on the gallows anyway?

02:07:28.448 --> 02:07:34.614
Really, my lord, you don't have
the moral right to spend their lives.

02:07:35.822 --> 02:07:39.519
Besides, what would you gain
by our death?

02:07:40.527 --> 02:07:43.690
Just that. Your death.

02:07:46.166 --> 02:07:48.464
You...

02:07:48.835 --> 02:07:53.135
...your mouth full of stinking piety.
Hypocrite!

02:07:53.473 --> 02:07:56.965
Have you said one word touched
with Christian charity and pity?

02:07:57.477 --> 02:07:59.069
Are you so pure?

02:07:59.246 --> 02:08:02.238
Nothing fishy about your life?
Nothing to be ashamed of?

02:08:02.449 --> 02:08:06.715
No white man hides himself
in the wilderness without a reason!

02:08:09.389 --> 02:08:13.689
Come, my lord,
what made you run from your world?

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:18.559
Are we not exiles, you and I, not good
enough for the world out there?

02:08:19.533 --> 02:08:22.525
Are we so far apart?

02:08:22.903 --> 02:08:26.430
Have we not the same roots,
the same skin?

02:08:26.607 --> 02:08:28.575
Same God?

02:08:28.742 --> 02:08:30.869
Same weaknesses?

02:08:31.044 --> 02:08:36.676
Have you never begged forgiveness,
never needed a second chance?

02:08:37.985 --> 02:08:40.613
You'll give up your weapons.

02:08:40.921 --> 02:08:42.855
And leave my men helpless?

02:08:43.023 --> 02:08:45.583
I may be a scoundrel,
but a deserter...

02:08:45.759 --> 02:08:49.718
No, sir. I'd rather die
than spend another day in prison.

02:08:49.896 --> 02:08:52.626
And if we're to die,
this place is as good as any.

02:08:52.866 --> 02:08:56.529
But remember, when it comes
to saving one's life in the dark...

02:08:56.703 --> 02:09:01.436
...one doesn't care how many go down.
Do you? Three more, 30, 300.

02:09:01.608 --> 02:09:06.068
That's the choice. Let us go,
be rid of us, or fight and be damned.

02:09:06.246 --> 02:09:08.214
Choose!

02:09:09.449 --> 02:09:12.441
If you hear a big bell tolling...

02:09:12.653 --> 02:09:14.883
...you'll get your boat...

02:09:15.055 --> 02:09:17.819
...and a safe passage out.

02:09:18.025 --> 02:09:21.825
- Lf you hear a rifle shot...
- Till when do we wait?

02:09:22.029 --> 02:09:26.398
- Till it's decided.
- Decided? By whom? By them?

02:09:26.566 --> 02:09:30.730
Even if you tolled the bell, is your
word good enough against theirs?

02:09:33.473 --> 02:09:35.771
Yes.

02:09:35.942 --> 02:09:39.309
You're white, clean through.

02:09:39.479 --> 02:09:45.645
In the name of God Almighty himself,
I trust you.

02:10:07.341 --> 02:10:09.309
Glass.

02:10:09.609 --> 02:10:13.170
- You should have killed him.
- Shut your gob.

02:10:13.347 --> 02:10:17.807
- I could've gone home rich, respected...
- And dead.

02:10:18.719 --> 02:10:21.313
Without even a penny
to keep your eyes closed.

02:10:21.521 --> 02:10:25.617
Might as well be dead
as go home empty-handed.

02:10:25.826 --> 02:10:30.854
If I am an expert judge of human
weakness, depravity and avarice...

02:10:31.031 --> 02:10:33.022
...and I am...

02:10:33.734 --> 02:10:36.897
...we shall not leave here
unrewarded for our labor.

02:10:37.337 --> 02:10:39.669
Give them their boat.

02:10:40.006 --> 02:10:44.340
- Let them go away.
- Why? Those men broke the law.

02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:46.411
Now they must answer to the law.

02:10:46.613 --> 02:10:52.017
That law is the oldest of our land.
The law of survival. Death for death.

02:10:52.219 --> 02:10:55.245
- There's more than one kind of law.
- Which kind?

02:10:55.422 --> 02:10:58.482
Your private law? Colonial justice?

02:10:58.658 --> 02:11:01.889
Or is it perhaps
your Christian conscience?

02:11:02.863 --> 02:11:04.194
Perhaps.

02:11:04.364 --> 02:11:07.697
Perhaps your conscience
is colored by your skin.

02:11:09.202 --> 02:11:14.663
His lordship has the self-righteous
stench of a converted sinner.

02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:17.708
He'll trust us to prove
that we can trust him.

02:11:17.878 --> 02:11:20.574
But what's the profit?
What's he get?

02:11:20.747 --> 02:11:22.681
Glory.

02:11:22.849 --> 02:11:25.909
Forgiveness for his sins.

02:11:26.453 --> 02:11:28.580
What's he done?

02:11:28.922 --> 02:11:32.414
It doesn't matter very much
what he's done.

02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:35.594
Just so he thinks it much.

02:11:35.896 --> 02:11:37.727
- You said they'd go in peace.
- Yes.

02:11:37.898 --> 02:11:39.388
- You trust their word?
- Yes.

02:11:39.566 --> 02:11:40.931
Their word.

02:11:41.101 --> 02:11:43.968
Ask the police of any port
from Jidda to Makassar...

02:11:44.171 --> 02:11:47.072
...about the word
of Gentlemen Brown.

02:11:47.274 --> 02:11:49.572
Tell the boy's mama...

02:11:50.544 --> 02:11:52.671
...and her mama...

02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.748
...how very sorry I am.

02:11:59.719 --> 02:12:03.746
- Why must you go against the majority?
- Is the majority always right?

02:12:03.924 --> 02:12:07.382
Is your conscience,
yours alone, right?

02:12:07.828 --> 02:12:10.592
Why must you take
this thing on yourself?

02:12:10.764 --> 02:12:14.723
Because I'm responsible
for everyone on...

02:12:15.969 --> 02:12:18.733
Yes. But Brown...

02:12:18.905 --> 02:12:21.806
What is he to you, or you to him?
You owe him nothing.

02:12:23.443 --> 02:12:27.812
This has to do with me, not him!

02:12:28.114 --> 02:12:30.912
- This is my word, not his.
- Words.

02:12:31.117 --> 02:12:35.349
Even for the cleanest mouth,
words are a poor security.

02:12:39.793 --> 02:12:41.124
All right.

02:12:43.363 --> 02:12:47.800
If even one of your people dies
because of what I ask...

02:12:47.968 --> 02:12:50.528
...l'll forfeit my own life.

02:12:59.112 --> 02:13:01.478
It comes to one thing:

02:13:02.015 --> 02:13:05.348
- Do we trust him?
- Do you?

02:13:06.386 --> 02:13:07.751
Yes.

02:13:18.164 --> 02:13:21.327
Ring the bell. Close the book.

02:13:22.536 --> 02:13:25.869
- Quench the candle.
- What's that?

02:13:26.039 --> 02:13:28.701
Never heard the final sentence
of excommunication?

02:13:30.710 --> 02:13:36.979
- For God's sake, are we safe?
- What sinner is safe from damnation?

02:13:38.151 --> 02:13:41.848
Father? Go to the temple, Father.

02:13:43.590 --> 02:13:45.990
Tell the people to stay at home.

02:13:57.337 --> 02:14:01.273
- That's my boat, all right.
- Captain, I salute you.

02:14:01.441 --> 02:14:02.908
Yes.

02:14:03.076 --> 02:14:07.035
Now, place all guns on the boat.

02:14:07.213 --> 02:14:11.274
We have one objective,
only one. The money.

02:14:11.451 --> 02:14:15.285
And may I remind you that
vengeance belongs to God...

02:14:15.455 --> 02:14:18.322
...is that clear?
- That's not.

02:14:21.761 --> 02:14:24.889
The trusting souls
are even lighting our way.

02:14:25.065 --> 02:14:29.832
Notice all of them
posted downriver. Perfect.

02:14:30.103 --> 02:14:33.869
Now, then, mister, illusion is the trick.
Make it slow and noisy.

02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:37.134
Stall your engine, start again,
keep moving, stop...

02:14:37.344 --> 02:14:39.642
...anything to keep attention
on the boat.

02:14:39.846 --> 02:14:43.976
Your boat will be the pied piper.
They'll follow as you go.

02:14:47.854 --> 02:14:52.484
- Take off your shoes.
- I'll stay with the boat, just in case.

02:14:52.659 --> 02:14:55.423
Take off your shoes.

02:15:01.568 --> 02:15:02.933
Brown!

02:15:03.570 --> 02:15:06.801
- Captain Brown!
- At your service, my lord.

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:11.340
- Light your portside lamp!
- Yes, sir.

02:15:11.511 --> 02:15:17.006
- But it'll be slow-going in this muck.
- Just keep moving. Don't stop.

02:15:17.183 --> 02:15:19.117
Stop?

02:15:19.285 --> 02:15:21.776
Whatever for?

02:15:22.188 --> 02:15:26.147
Don't you fret, milord,
a gentleman's word is his bond.

02:15:26.326 --> 02:15:31.662
You won't regret this kindness.
May God bless and keep you.

02:15:31.831 --> 02:15:34.629
- Where's my blasted first officer?
- Here, sir.

02:15:34.834 --> 02:15:37.132
Take over, mister.

02:15:38.405 --> 02:15:40.999
Look lively, men.

02:15:41.307 --> 02:15:44.037
- Ready to cast off?
- Cast off!

02:15:44.277 --> 02:15:47.508
- Hey, hey!
- Who's yelling? What happened?

02:15:47.681 --> 02:15:51.481
Wait! Hey, it's the donkeyman,
Captain Brown, sir.

02:15:51.651 --> 02:15:52.982
He's still ashore!

02:15:53.186 --> 02:15:56.019
- He says he can't. He's hurt his foot.
- Go get him!

02:15:56.222 --> 02:15:59.214
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Won't be a minute, captain, sir.

02:15:59.459 --> 02:16:02.826
And I gotta get some
steam up anyway.

02:16:07.467 --> 02:16:09.332
Cold?

02:16:10.937 --> 02:16:14.839
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.

02:16:15.075 --> 02:16:17.976
And yet, something.

02:16:18.144 --> 02:16:23.172
Perhaps it is not a thing.
More like a feeling.

02:16:23.850 --> 02:16:25.681
- Yes.
- You sense it also?

02:16:25.852 --> 02:16:27.376
Yes.

02:16:27.554 --> 02:16:29.886
Does it have a name, this feeling?

02:16:30.356 --> 02:16:32.347
Many names.

02:16:32.525 --> 02:16:34.549
Destiny.

02:16:34.727 --> 02:16:36.491
Luck.

02:16:37.330 --> 02:16:38.661
Fate.

02:16:39.232 --> 02:16:41.359
Then all of this
was meant to happen?

02:16:43.102 --> 02:16:45.571
And of all places to happen.

02:16:45.739 --> 02:16:47.502
Here...

02:16:47.741 --> 02:16:49.766
...in paradise.

02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:52.870
Patusan.

02:16:53.612 --> 02:16:58.778
Take two letters from Patusan,
U and S.

02:16:59.486 --> 02:17:01.249
Us.

02:17:01.788 --> 02:17:03.847
What's left?

02:17:04.591 --> 02:17:08.549
- "Patna."
- What is Patna?

02:17:09.129 --> 02:17:13.498
An ugly hag of a sea witch.

02:17:13.933 --> 02:17:18.233
A phantom ship coming
to settle an old account.

02:17:18.538 --> 02:17:22.371
Something that happened
a long time ago...

02:17:22.742 --> 02:17:25.302
...on a night like this.

02:17:26.212 --> 02:17:29.045
In a fog like this.

02:17:29.249 --> 02:17:34.118
Stand by, everybody! Cast off
at the stern. And keep a sharp lookout!

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:52.500
You. You. Reconnoiter.
Clear the decks.

02:17:52.672 --> 02:17:56.267
You show them the way.

02:17:59.344 --> 02:18:02.678
Keep her midstream.
Starboard. More to starboard!

02:18:02.915 --> 02:18:04.781
Don't let that engine die.

02:18:51.865 --> 02:18:55.062
Let me talk to Brown!

02:18:55.235 --> 02:18:57.532
I told you to watch
that engine, stupid.

02:18:58.237 --> 02:19:02.868
I found the trouble, Captain Brown,
sir. It's the feed line.

02:19:12.352 --> 02:19:14.478
Nothing can stop us now.
He's done for.

02:19:14.853 --> 02:19:16.481
Jim. Finished.

02:19:35.708 --> 02:19:37.437
No.

02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:42.011
This is what they came to get.

02:19:42.348 --> 02:19:45.407
They must not leave without it.

02:19:46.519 --> 02:19:48.076
The windows.

02:19:48.254 --> 02:19:51.883
We must make them
come through there.

02:20:23.589 --> 02:20:25.386
Forgive me.

02:20:25.892 --> 02:20:27.484
We do...

02:20:28.061 --> 02:20:29.961
...what we must.

02:21:36.029 --> 02:21:37.621
Jim.

02:21:39.699 --> 02:21:41.633
Jim, boy.

02:21:41.834 --> 02:21:44.667
Here. Take the money.

02:21:45.905 --> 02:21:47.167
Take it!

02:23:10.756 --> 02:23:13.486
Sometimes, from a good intention
comes evil...

02:23:13.659 --> 02:23:16.059
...if God wills it so.

02:23:16.496 --> 02:23:20.227
This was not done
by the hand of God.

02:23:20.399 --> 02:23:21.730
Nor by Jim.

02:23:22.068 --> 02:23:24.468
His hands are not clean.

02:23:25.571 --> 02:23:28.665
Your judgment is clouded
with a father's anger.

02:23:30.776 --> 02:23:32.903
Become a father...

02:23:33.079 --> 02:23:36.947
...before you judge a father's anger.

02:23:40.253 --> 02:23:43.086
But the law is without anger.

02:23:43.756 --> 02:23:45.690
Look at your son.

02:23:45.958 --> 02:23:48.426
Did he die in anger?

02:23:55.701 --> 02:23:58.534
Tell him to go.

02:23:59.772 --> 02:24:01.467
Tell him...

02:24:01.941 --> 02:24:05.001
...to take the woman and go...

02:24:05.945 --> 02:24:07.606
...tonight.

02:24:08.714 --> 02:24:10.511
Thank you.

02:24:11.951 --> 02:24:16.183
In the morning,
if I find him still here...

02:24:16.622 --> 02:24:20.114
...by his own word...

02:24:21.194 --> 02:24:23.958
...he owes the law...

02:24:24.564 --> 02:24:25.929
...his life.

02:24:36.509 --> 02:24:38.943
- Ready?
- I'm staying.

02:24:42.448 --> 02:24:46.077
Have you understood nothing?
If you stay, you die.

02:24:46.252 --> 02:24:48.880
That's a simple fact.
Must it be explained?

02:24:49.055 --> 02:24:51.990
Do facts ever explain anything?

02:24:52.191 --> 02:24:54.421
I know you, mister.

02:24:54.594 --> 02:24:57.995
You don't expect to die.
You expect a miracle.

02:24:58.164 --> 02:25:00.155
You will strut out there like a hero.

02:25:00.333 --> 02:25:03.860
Du-Ramin will shoot,
but the gun will not fire.

02:25:04.570 --> 02:25:06.231
Already, you hear the cheering.

02:25:06.405 --> 02:25:09.272
Always, you hear the applause
before the deed.

02:25:09.475 --> 02:25:11.705
Your kinds of hero need victims.

02:25:11.877 --> 02:25:14.345
You profit by their despair.

02:25:14.513 --> 02:25:17.209
And who will be the victim this time?

02:25:17.383 --> 02:25:19.374
This time...

02:25:19.585 --> 02:25:21.849
...l'll be my own victim.

02:25:22.021 --> 02:25:25.354
So you want a neat, orderly world.

02:25:25.625 --> 02:25:26.990
Yes.

02:25:27.193 --> 02:25:30.788
Perfect conduct for the imperfect man
in his imperfect world.

02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:33.191
- That's right.
- A quick, clean ending.

02:25:33.366 --> 02:25:37.063
- Yes.
- Full of morals and high purpose.

02:25:37.236 --> 02:25:39.864
What morals? What purpose?

02:25:40.072 --> 02:25:43.098
Do you think you'll pay
for the Patna this way?

02:25:44.310 --> 02:25:46.710
I don't know any other way.

02:25:47.046 --> 02:25:49.708
You think the world cares
how you die?

02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:52.945
I care.

02:25:53.119 --> 02:25:56.088
But... But there is nothing in suicide.

02:25:56.255 --> 02:25:58.314
No victory, not even salvation.

02:25:58.524 --> 02:26:00.458
Not even peace?

02:26:00.626 --> 02:26:04.494
There is too much pride
in your humility.

02:26:04.664 --> 02:26:06.461
Perhaps there is no best way.

02:26:06.632 --> 02:26:08.293
But surely not his way.

02:26:08.467 --> 02:26:11.436
Be practical. Take him and run.

02:26:12.538 --> 02:26:15.098
Someone else said that.

02:26:16.809 --> 02:26:18.970
"Run," he said.

02:26:19.679 --> 02:26:21.408
"Hide."

02:26:22.348 --> 02:26:27.081
"Crawl into a hole 20 feet deep
and disappear."

02:26:29.121 --> 02:26:30.816
How?

02:26:31.324 --> 02:26:35.954
How do you hide with a stone the size
of the Patna around your neck?

02:26:36.162 --> 02:26:39.290
How do you end a bad dream?

02:26:40.099 --> 02:26:43.626
The dream is not bad and not good.

02:26:43.803 --> 02:26:46.567
Not a vice and not a virtue.

02:26:46.806 --> 02:26:50.435
The dream exists, like the...
Like the Earth, like the sea.

02:26:50.609 --> 02:26:51.940
The dream is you.

02:26:52.978 --> 02:26:55.879
To end the dream,
you must end yourself.

02:26:56.282 --> 02:27:00.446
To survive a dream, you must, to the
destructive element, submit yourself...

02:27:00.619 --> 02:27:02.450
...and fight with hands and feet.

02:27:02.621 --> 02:27:05.681
Fight to make the deep, deep sea
keep you up, alive.

02:27:05.858 --> 02:27:07.951
You must look at yourself
as you are.

02:27:08.127 --> 02:27:09.958
You must face the truth.

02:27:10.129 --> 02:27:11.858
The truth.

02:27:14.133 --> 02:27:15.464
What is the truth?

02:27:21.374 --> 02:27:24.036
I've been a so-called coward...

02:27:25.144 --> 02:27:27.704
...and a so-called hero.

02:27:28.681 --> 02:27:33.345
And there's not the thickness of
a sheet of paper between them.

02:27:34.854 --> 02:27:37.550
Maybe cowards and heroes
are just ordinary men...

02:27:37.723 --> 02:27:42.660
...who, for a split second,
do something out of the ordinary.

02:27:43.362 --> 02:27:45.125
That's all.

02:27:49.535 --> 02:27:52.561
I've never wanted so much to live...

02:27:58.677 --> 02:28:01.202
...and I've never been
so afraid to die.

02:28:02.882 --> 02:28:05.077
I'll get you a new start.

02:28:06.018 --> 02:28:07.542
You'll see.

02:28:09.722 --> 02:28:11.713
It will be...

02:28:17.696 --> 02:28:20.256
You're like a father to me.

02:28:21.267 --> 02:28:23.098
Please...

02:28:23.702 --> 02:28:25.761
...don't save me.

02:28:26.906 --> 02:28:29.101
Help me, Papa.

02:28:31.076 --> 02:28:34.239
Help me do what I have to do.

02:28:37.416 --> 02:28:40.180
We both know what that is.

02:28:43.689 --> 02:28:47.090
I don't know why things
happened the way they did.

02:28:48.227 --> 02:28:50.559
You do something wrong...

02:28:51.263 --> 02:28:53.322
...and it begins.

02:28:53.999 --> 02:28:57.059
You lie to yourself, and that's wrong.

02:28:57.770 --> 02:29:00.603
You try to cover up,
and that's wrong.

02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:06.009
And once these things
get to moving...

02:29:07.847 --> 02:29:10.145
...they take their own course...

02:29:10.983 --> 02:29:13.508
...and there's no stopping them...

02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:16.786
...till they reach their own end.

02:29:18.090 --> 02:29:23.585
Just being sorry doesn't
change it or make it right.

02:29:25.865 --> 02:29:28.356
And it's not even what you do...

02:29:30.769 --> 02:29:32.999
...but why you do it.

02:29:34.673 --> 02:29:39.975
I guess that's really
the eye of the needle.

02:29:42.882 --> 02:29:45.874
Maybe... Maybe next time you...

02:29:46.051 --> 02:29:48.315
This is my next time.

02:29:48.487 --> 02:29:50.148
Now...

02:29:51.023 --> 02:29:53.048
...with the morning...

02:29:53.626 --> 02:29:54.991
...end the dream.

02:29:55.194 --> 02:29:56.855
Give yourself another chance.

02:29:57.062 --> 02:29:59.792
I had my chance, Papa...

02:30:00.199 --> 02:30:02.064
...and I lost.

02:30:03.903 --> 02:30:07.361
But if I lose without honor...

02:30:10.809 --> 02:30:13.801
...if, at the last moment, I weaken...

02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:16.980
...then it's all...

02:30:21.186 --> 02:30:23.017
...without meaning.

02:30:25.391 --> 02:30:27.325
Wasted.
