LIKE, SO,
IF YOU WEREN'T AROUND,

20:24.734 --> 20:27.233
I WOULD BE WITH CORY
ALL THE TIME?

20:27.233 --> 20:28.500
WELL, YEAH.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.100
TILL DEATH DO YOU PART,
RIGHT?

20:31.100 --> 20:33.800
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED,
ISN'T IT?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.600
WHOA! HEY, HEY, HEY!

20:35.600 --> 20:37.100
HEY!

20:37.100 --> 20:40.700
YOU ARE VERY IMPORTANT
IN MY LIFE, SHAWN.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.400
YOU GUYS GOT ROOM FOR ME?

20:42.400 --> 20:45.000
YEP. WE HAVE
THE PERFECT SPOT.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.400
RIGHT BETWEEN ME
AND THE WIFE.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.000
All: HEY!

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
ALL RIGHT, MR. FEENY...

20:52.000 --> 20:53.133
YOU'RE UP.

20:53.133 --> 20:54.133

20:54.133 --> 20:57.000
All Chanting:
FEENY! FEENY!

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
CLASS DISMISSED!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.500
GET HIM!

21:00.500 --> 21:02.133
BIG HUG FOR FEENY!
