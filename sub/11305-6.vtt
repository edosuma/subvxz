WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.835
<i>Pre viously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:07.213
You wait until everyone you love
is in agony.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.379
All I want

00:10.552 --> 00:13.215
are the scumbags
who came for Ward Earp.

00:13.388 --> 00:16.631
I have a picture of all seven
standing by your dad's body.

00:16.808 --> 00:20.552
I know you've been looking for
Stone Witch. I have her name.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.018
- I encountered this at the BBD.
- Kandahar?

00:25.192 --> 00:26.979
We're all guilty of something,
right, Earp?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.069
We can't.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.277
Arrgh!

00:34.451 --> 00:38.445
C'mon, baby, use the force!
Uh-oh, crap!

00:40.624 --> 00:42.240
See, you're dead again.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.659
And unlike revenants,
you can't come back to life.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.044
Oh.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.586
Except as a ghost.
I'll haunt your ass sideways.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.375
Come on.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.385
Nope.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.547
Ugh!

00:56.723 --> 00:58.806
Stay focused, Earp.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.389
I want you here... now.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.428
- That's what all the boys say.
- Oh, yeah?

01:06.441 --> 01:09.184
- Yah!
- No. No.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.653
No.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.439
- Dead.
- Ahh!

01:14.616 --> 01:17.154
Wake up.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.487
Break your shoulder.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.907
Arrgh! Or we could just
go for a beer. Come on.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.497
Ugh!

01:26.670 --> 01:29.788
Come on, find my weakness.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.336
Ice-cream? The Clippers? Thongs?

01:36.513 --> 01:39.381
The revenants are gonna win,
you're gonna fail,

01:39.558 --> 01:41.345
and then we're all gonna die.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.931
Ugh!

01:50.777 --> 01:53.190
Ha!

01:53.363 --> 01:55.150
Say my name, bitch!

01:55.324 --> 01:57.782
No, I mean, make your peace.
It's my new jam.

01:57.951 --> 02:02.036
Huh. Nhh, nhh, nhh.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.198
- Good job.
- You think I don't listen. I do.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.413
- Yeah, you've limbered up.
- Yoga.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.126
- No, it's something else.
- What?

02:12.299 --> 02:13.961
What makes you say that?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.844
Yoga fosters serenity
and I see zero evidence of that.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.843
No inner rest for the wicked.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.885
'Cause I still have
a hideous to-do list.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.849
Show that to Waverly.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.230
See if she can identify
the last two revenants.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.891
Way ahead of you.

02:32.069 --> 02:35.107
Except for the showing her part,
which I am going to do.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.148
At dinner. Come with?
It's on you.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.782
I gotta clean up.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.492
You gotta loosen up. Later.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:11.191 --> 03:13.399
Hello?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.604
You said Clootie would be there.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.436
No, I said it was
her last-known name and address.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.818
And that much
is a goddamned gift.

03:57.988 --> 04:01.982
Well, your 'gift',
as you call it, was useless.

04:02.159 --> 04:05.493
- Tits on a bull.
- Well, then she's in the wind.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.575
And I'm thinking
you're the reason she ran.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.832
Know any idea why that would be?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.914
Well, the one that comes to mind,
I mean, perhaps,

04:14.087 --> 04:15.703
is that I want the witch dead.

04:17.882 --> 04:22.173
Now, I sympathise with
your predicament.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.132
I'm also two spits away
from finding

04:24.306 --> 04:26.138
the one thing that I want most
in this world,

04:26.308 --> 04:28.675
but damned if I can't
turn it up now.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.266
- Why would that be, Doc?
- I really don't give a shit.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.231
See, my interest in you
has waned

04:36.401 --> 04:38.188
and I have located other parties

04:38.361 --> 04:41.854
whose pursuits are more...
comparable to mine.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.149
Really?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.870
I will leave your tongue

04:49.039 --> 04:51.406
flapping out your windpipe.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.042
You'll be pulling lead
out of your ass for months.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.709
I'm bored.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.879
Leave if you want.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.466
Go get dead.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.222
Only one death scared me.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.303
And it didn't take...

05:13.230 --> 05:14.721
Bobo.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.643
Where the hell is everyone,
Torque?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.528
This is all that showed up today,
boss.

05:22.697 --> 05:26.441
Maybe what you pussies need
is a little, uh, motivation.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.708
Please, boss!

05:38.797 --> 05:41.164
Oh!

05:43.718 --> 05:45.550
- Whoop!
- Uhh!

05:45.720 --> 05:48.178
Ohh! Ever hear of manscaping?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.340
Hey, that was
meant for private eyes.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.260
Don't tell me you're back
chomping at the Champ.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.803
Come on,
he is just so beneath you.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.768
Uh, yeah, he is.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.557
Gross, dude.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.772
There is more to life
than crazy hot, toe curling,

06:02.946 --> 06:06.439
out of body, back into body,

06:06.616 --> 06:08.949
angels-singing-Hallelujah sex.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.032
Wait, wait. Hold up.
Whose truck are you borrowing?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.821
Please, I can get
from here to there

06:13.999 --> 06:16.116
on my own horsepower, thank you.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.034
Wait, who is it? Is it Dolls?

06:18.211 --> 06:21.170
- Please.
- What's up, Waverly?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.955
I never see you.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.045
Yeah, um, I know.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.834
Well, between late shifts
at Shorty's

06:27.012 --> 06:29.052
and, well, you know,
my sister's back in town, so...

06:29.139 --> 06:30.755
Hey, Hetty.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.050
Order up. Hetty, you hustle that butt
before food gets cold.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.843
Coming, Mama.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.230
She keeps wondering
who does such "terrible things".

06:41.359 --> 06:44.022
Probably someone with a big bug
up their ass.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.438
Wait, coffee? More coffee?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.573
You're not getting
any better, hon.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.991
But I know that some day,
people will see through the noise

06:54.164 --> 06:55.924
and understand
what a beautiful soul you are.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.869
Let's get serious.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.370
Ugh, God, I hate that picture.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.709
I love it.
Reminds me why I'm needed.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.715
Right, two left.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.252
Faceless
is a pain-in-my-ass mystery.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.170
But this one...

07:12.974 --> 07:14.966
You know anything
about Neck Tattoo here?

07:15.143 --> 07:16.975
Uh...

07:17.979 --> 07:20.687
Yeah, looks like
an old cattle brand.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.565
For that sort of stuff,
Uncle Curtis used to go and see...

07:24.611 --> 07:27.479
- No. No, no, no.
- Who?

07:27.656 --> 07:30.820
No, nobody goes out there
unless they really, really have to.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.656
Who is this person nobody goes
to see unless they have to?

07:36.206 --> 07:37.993
The Blacksmith.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.416
OK, tell me more
about this Blacksmith.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.798
In 10 words or less?
'Cause that's all Waverly had.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.335
Artist, loner,
mucho info about the Triangle.

07:50.512 --> 07:54.051
So will they help us with a revenant,
some revenants, what?

07:54.224 --> 07:56.261
Look, I'm the one
with the vendetta.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.050
Why are you gunning so hard?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.810
- Whoa!
- Ooh! What?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.723
Don't move. Landmine.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.521
Oh, good. There's more.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.946
And it comes with accessories.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.324
Always been branded a bad girl,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.114
just didn't expect it
to happen for real.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.790
You know, the only thing I hate
more than trespassers

08:25.964 --> 08:27.580
is an Earp.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.044
I mean, I can feel
your negative energy from here.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.381
But landmines and a magical hot poker
scream good vibes?

08:34.764 --> 08:38.347
Who's your barely disguised friend?
FBI? CIA? UPS?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.453
Don't ask - it takes him,
like, five minutes to explain

08:40.477 --> 08:42.094
and we don't have time.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.436
I'm kind of in the shit
and only you can help.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.270
- Why should I?
- Because if you don't,

08:47.444 --> 08:51.939
you're gonna be helping things
far worse than an Earp.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.731
- Good answer.
- Thanks.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.744
Alright. Come on.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.906
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hello!
Uh, how do you deactivate...

09:03.543 --> 09:06.627
Great Gaia, it's not live.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.334
What do you think I am?

09:09.507 --> 09:12.625
One, two, three.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.340
Ahh!

09:33.823 --> 09:36.566
- Hardcore.
- That's what it means?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.985
No, that's what they were.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.121
These are livestock brands
from the late 1800s till now.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.906
Registered and unregistered.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.497
So you made all of these?

09:47.504 --> 09:50.588
No. I've collected them here
as a reminder.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.876
Those who are marked -
who are chosen -

09:55.053 --> 09:56.669
often did not choose it
themselves.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.462
I feel you, sister.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.552
The Tate family
were cattle rustlers.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.661
They stole livestock
and rebranded it as their own.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.644
- So any Tates still in the area?
- Not that I know of.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.644
You're in pain.
I felt it straightaway.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.939
- Just a cold going around.
- No, no.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.355
There's a battle.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.148
Deep inside.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.534
Your soul is being torn.
You must protect it.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.454
- Let me make you a salve.
- Hey.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.393
You got one that'll cure
crotchety curmudgeon-it is?

10:26.417 --> 10:29.034
- 'Cause he's got a raging case.
- We got everything we need.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.794
- Come on, Earp.
- Sorry.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.832
He's not used to acting normal,
human.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.795
Thanks for your help.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.216
God, there's just so much!

10:43.393 --> 10:45.476
Yeah, Curtis spent
the last few years of his life

10:45.645 --> 10:47.682
hand-picking it from
the Badlands to the Rockies.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.722
And you know that because...

10:49.899 --> 10:53.518
'Cause every time he went out,
I did two things, drive and dig.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.652
Curtis had a nose
for buried stuff.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.486
He was kind of like you,
into the...

10:59.659 --> 11:02.322
into the past of
where things come from

11:02.495 --> 11:05.408
and, you know,
stuff before today, uh...

11:05.582 --> 11:08.916
- You mean, like, history?
- Yep.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.831
How can somebody so pretty
be so smart, huh?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.587
Uh?

11:13.756 --> 11:15.463
Because they're not
mutually exclusive.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.376
I know. Remember the last time
we got mutually exclusive?

11:18.553 --> 11:20.715
Now, that was historic, hey?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.721
- Huh? Right?
- Babe.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.178
Not in front of my legacy.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.513
What's this?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.804
Oh, my God, Uncle Curtis.

11:33.818 --> 11:37.732
- It's his handwriting.
- Oh. What is it?

11:41.993 --> 11:44.531
It's a poem.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.821
"There once was
a girl from Nantucket..." Huh?

11:48.791 --> 11:50.828
Hands off my sister,
nine seconds.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.210
It was eight seconds, loser.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.793
Waves, in your research,

11:56.966 --> 11:59.049
you come across
any cattle rustlers?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.131
- Tate family?
- Yeah, sure.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.144
I guess somewhere along the way
they went legit

12:03.181 --> 12:05.047
because they eventually morphed
into Tatenhill.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.057
As in Tatenhill Farms.

12:07.227 --> 12:11.517
Totally organic operation,
grass-fed...

12:11.689 --> 12:14.432
- Neck tat?
- Think so.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.818
- What the hell?
- 1200 Stage 1 Screaming Eagle.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.607
Yeah, I hauled it for Waverly.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.903
No, Curtis's will stipulated
that the bike goes to Wynonna.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.744
What?

12:30.917 --> 12:34.456
Ohh! I knew we were soulmates!

12:34.629 --> 12:36.245
Ohhh!

12:38.383 --> 12:41.501
What am I gonna name
this sexy beast?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.294
Doc.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.551
Never seen a cowgirl look
more at home in the saddle.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.509
Bend your ear a moment, Wynonna?
In private.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.480
You're here.
And why are you here?

12:58.653 --> 13:00.610
I just...
'Cause, of course, you can be.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.648
It's just I wasn't expecting...
That'd be weird. Why would I?

13:03.825 --> 13:06.568
When it comes to understanding
the delicate nature of women,

13:06.744 --> 13:08.576
I'm not the fastest draw
in the West

13:08.746 --> 13:11.489
and I always find it difficult
to make the request of a lady.

13:11.666 --> 13:15.159
- But, you know, we...
- We? There's no 'we'.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.204
'Cause if there was,
that would just be way...

13:18.381 --> 13:20.122
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.709
Wait, what are you asking me?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.718
Wynonna...

13:29.934 --> 13:31.891
I need you to arrange
a meeting for me

13:32.061 --> 13:33.848
with Deputy Marshal Dolls.

13:37.817 --> 13:42.858
Yes, but with all due respect, sir,
I heard you the first time.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.824
Sir, the supply is low.
I had to dilute some of the...

13:50.580 --> 13:52.367
Look, I need more.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.829
I understand.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.746
Yo, Dolls!

14:02.550 --> 14:04.507
Yes. I'll be right out.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.008
You know,
there are some things...

14:13.186 --> 14:14.973
He wants to talk to you.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.149
- About what exactly?
- I don't know. He's right here.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.731
Could you kindly convey
to Deputy Marshal Dolls

14:22.904 --> 14:25.271
that the nature of my visit
is earnest?

14:25.448 --> 14:27.610
Nope. I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.704
Besides, there is one
sprinkle doughnut out there

14:29.869 --> 14:31.701
with my name all over it.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.915
I know you and me,
we're as different as whisky and tea,

14:37.085 --> 14:38.701
but I find myself

14:38.878 --> 14:41.245
in the compromising position
of needing your help.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.150
Well, tea's getting cold, Holliday.
What's up?

14:43.174 --> 14:44.790
I'm looking for a woman.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.754
Used to go by the name
of Constance Clootie.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.386
- Now uses the alias CC Stone.
- Bobo's lawyer?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.888
And the witch responsible
for my tenure

14:52.058 --> 14:54.015
at the bottom of
that godforsaken well.

14:54.185 --> 14:57.178
Witch... The Stone Witch?

14:57.355 --> 14:59.893
- I don't know her by that name.
- Why should I help you?

15:00.983 --> 15:04.226
Well, because I know how badly
you want information

15:04.404 --> 15:06.270
on one Bobo Del Rey.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.239
I need evidence of
his more unearthly activities.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.496
Get me that and we have a deal.
You understand?

15:29.303 --> 15:32.137
My father always told me,

15:32.306 --> 15:34.798
"Never trust a man
with sweaty palms."

15:44.152 --> 15:46.860
But then again, he wasn't
the risk-taker that I am.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.941
You have the day to deliver.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.163
Is it official?
Are you two going steady?

15:59.333 --> 16:02.917
Yeah,
we've come to an agreement.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.204
So how do you feel about cows?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.856
OK, so we need this one alive.
HQ says we're not delivering.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.322
They need hard evidence
of revenant activity.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.361
Quid pro quo
for the resources they provide.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.298
What resources?
You won't even buy me dinner.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.948
Could you please
take this seriously

16:41.125 --> 16:43.492
just ONE goddamned time?

16:45.254 --> 16:48.918
OK, A - the last guy
who talked to me like that

16:49.091 --> 16:51.629
got a nail gun to the nads.

16:51.802 --> 16:56.797
And B - creepy dude,
farmhouse porch, 2 o'clock.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.180
Oh, yeah, Dolls. That's him.

17:07.318 --> 17:11.107
Hey! Stop!
I've got a beef with you, Tate.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.114
And it's not just delivering
meat puns.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.444
- Leave us alone!
- Don't shoot him, Earp.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.575
I can see your
great-great-granddaddy

17:24.752 --> 17:26.367
in your eyes.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.959
- Last thing I saw before...
- I can cuff him, Earp.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.374
- Put 'Peacemaker' down, OK?
- He attacked my home, Dolls.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.794
Dragged my sister to her death.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.758
Took a souvenir photo
with my father's body.

17:36.931 --> 17:40.095
And I hope he burned in hell!

17:49.402 --> 17:51.564
What the hell, Earp?!
Now they're gonna delay...

17:54.991 --> 17:58.405
Dolls, there'll be another one.
There's always another one.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.570
What the hell is your deal?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.574
Uhhh...

18:05.585 --> 18:07.747
- It's human.
- In theory anyway.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.712
'Us'.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.218
"Leave US alone,"
that's what Tate said.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.802
So who the hell is 'us'?

18:28.024 --> 18:30.892
Why do revenants always have to
be such a freakin' hassle?

18:31.068 --> 18:34.732
This guy had a mummified arm
on his property. And this.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.272
- It's way more than a 'hassle'.
- Good point.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.739
The at-home butcher shop
raises it to the level of aggravation.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.548
But the creep factor
on this aggro goes to 11.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.888
Not so much 'family'
as 'victims'.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.777
Maybe he tries to keep
their memories alive.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.467
Oh, that's nice.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.637
You know, for a serial killer.

19:55.486 --> 19:58.320
Ooh! Are we gonna role-play?

19:58.489 --> 20:00.606
Please don't shoot, Sheriff.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.742
My husband's in the barn,
so take what you will.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.618
And now you say...

20:05.788 --> 20:09.202
Well, how fortuitous for me
to find you here.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.413
Or does the good luck fall
on you?

20:12.586 --> 20:15.044
Baby, either talk sense
with those lips

20:15.214 --> 20:17.297
or use 'em for somethin' else.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.174
Now, this is what
Bobo's been digging up

20:20.344 --> 20:22.006
half of Purgatory for?

20:22.179 --> 20:24.091
- These two fellas?
- It's taken him years.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.382
Word is their bits
are spread out for miles.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.597
- Why?
- I'll tell you if you give me a ride.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.183
See, Bobo's putting 'em
back together

20:32.356 --> 20:35.099
for some slut in fancy clothes.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.063
To make some kind of trade.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.819
Bethany, love,
you don't set up the stakes

20:39.989 --> 20:41.981
and then give your hand away.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.360
Seriously?
You ain't so hot, you know.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.411
Don't. You'll be even less hot
when you're dead.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.667
Bobo will kill you
if he finds out you were here.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.419
And I'll kill you
if you tell him I was.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.236
'50.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.523
And one person in 1967.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.200
Then...

21:28.704 --> 21:31.663
11 people between '93 and 2000.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.293
Tate just starts hacking them
to death again this year. Why?

21:37.922 --> 21:41.290
Come on, come on.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.926
1967. One person in 1967.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.339
My grandfather Edwin Earp,
the one-year wonder?

21:48.516 --> 21:50.678
That was the year
he was the heir.

21:50.851 --> 21:55.437
Then nothing until '93
when my dad became the heir.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.438
And then nothing until...

21:57.608 --> 21:59.224
But that's before.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.484
The bone marrow in this arm
has been cleaned out.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.397
Spontaneous mummification
isn't unknown in nature.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.360
But this...

22:08.244 --> 22:09.655
Ain't natural.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.994
OK.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.541
Those are human bite marks.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.333
A cannibal revenant?

22:25.511 --> 22:27.280
Resources were scarce
in the old West. People starved.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.920
Eat or be eaten.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.636
Most would try not to
ever think of it again,

22:31.809 --> 22:34.176
but some... some just got
a taste for it.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.595
Like cilantro.

22:36.772 --> 22:40.186
Yeah, I was thinking more of
the Donner Party, but, sure.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.610
Ugh! I can't believe
this guy was eating people.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.646
'He' wasn't.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.941
Based on the...

22:49.118 --> 22:50.734
size of the jaw,

22:50.911 --> 22:53.028
we're looking for a woman.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.539
A cannibalistic,
serial-killing female revenant?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.245
Mmm.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.669
Some girls have all the fun.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.760
Ow!

23:28.949 --> 23:31.441
Hey, you. Headed into town?

23:31.619 --> 23:33.451
These boots ain't made
for walking.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.258
Your uncle's last wish
was to go to the bar?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.794
What, he wants us to
pour some out for his homies?

23:52.139 --> 23:56.930
"Every day I sit.
My beautiful mug in front."

23:58.562 --> 24:00.428
"There is but one tune."

24:03.901 --> 24:08.271
Here.
Look, he sat here every day.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.902
Yeah, what about
a "beautiful mug"?

24:12.076 --> 24:15.160
Old dude drank whisky.
From a glass.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.241
Yeah.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.996
Mug.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.292
Mug.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.622
My beautiful mug.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.512
Alright,
he was running that way.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.548
It's an open field.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.684
So we would've seen him
running for miles. Odd.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.518
This is where you shot him.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.018
Exactly when I asked you not to.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.236
Hey.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.200
Boundaries.

24:59.373 --> 25:02.207
You've got fever sweats, but
you're not even close to being warm.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.368
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You sure about that?

25:04.545 --> 25:06.707
Mm-hm. Look.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.355
Jeez, OK.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.773
Ohh!

25:36.744 --> 25:38.610
- OK...
- Whoa, whoa.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.537
Ladies first there, sickie.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.283
Jesus.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.713
Whoa, mummy.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.799
Or should I say 'mama'?

25:58.807 --> 26:02.426
Dolls, Mama Olive -
the woman who owns the diner?

26:02.603 --> 26:04.265
There's a picture on the wall

26:04.438 --> 26:06.646
of her sitting in
this exact chair.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.852
What do you think she was
doing down here? Hiding?

26:09.985 --> 26:11.897
Uh...

26:12.071 --> 26:14.063
I don't think she had a choice.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.861
Somebody's mad we broke in.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.122
- Just don't get eaten.
- Bite me.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.287
Dolls!

26:32.966 --> 26:34.707
Tune... Tune...

26:34.885 --> 26:37.166
Did he have, like, a favourite
drinking song or something?

26:37.221 --> 26:38.837
Shit, with his voice?

26:39.014 --> 26:40.880
Like a bunch of drunk ferrets
gangbanging.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.720
You know, when I was little,
he used to sing to me at bedtime.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.934
I used...

26:49.108 --> 26:52.897
I used to dance around
like... like an idiot.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.483
Gus would be yelling at us
to, like, "Shut the hell up."

27:23.016 --> 27:26.134
If you aren't the smartest thing
on two amazing legs...

27:26.311 --> 27:28.223
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.013
I hope it's a million dollars.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.399
We could open a little bar
down in, um, Buenos Aires.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.811
Huh?
I've always wanted that for us.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.856
Eww! Oh, my God.

27:40.868 --> 27:44.032
Oh, my God.
It's a real dead guy.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.786
"Waverly, darling,"

27:52.963 --> 27:55.250
"you are now
the keeper of the bones."

27:56.258 --> 27:59.296
"Guard this and tell no-one
but the Blacksmith."

28:00.387 --> 28:03.004
"You're the only one
I can trust."

28:03.182 --> 28:04.969
"Love, Uncle Curtis."

28:06.143 --> 28:07.759
I can't believe
Wynonna got the Harley.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.974
He always said
I was meant for bigger things.

28:11.148 --> 28:14.232
Paid for every one of
my crazy online courses.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.235
You know, dead languages,
offbeat history.

28:17.404 --> 28:20.112
God, it used to drive Gus nuts.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.698
But he believed in me.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.695
I can't think of a better gift.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.784
The keeper of the bones.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.992
You know, you'll always be
the keeper of my boner.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.711
Huh?

28:35.881 --> 28:37.841
Come on, let's shut that brain off
a little while.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.967
No.
I don't want my brain shut off.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.752
OK?

28:42.930 --> 28:45.422
I don't want to be
a barmaid in Buenos Aires.

28:45.599 --> 28:48.467
And it turns out
that a boner and a pick-up

28:48.644 --> 28:50.431
aren't the whole enchilada.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.517
No.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.397
We're done.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.729
Yeah. We're done, Champ.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.194
And I've got work to do.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.572
Dolls, hurry up!

29:06.745 --> 29:08.862
- You OK?
- I'm fine!

29:09.039 --> 29:11.122
I'm right behind you.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.875
No, you don't!

29:18.048 --> 29:21.257
I saw you get sucked into oblivion.
That happened, right?

29:21.426 --> 29:23.839
Ahh! Ugh!

29:27.975 --> 29:29.807
Did you get thinner?

29:29.977 --> 29:32.014
Don't tell me
you're a bulimic cannibal.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.139
No! Ahh!

29:39.069 --> 29:41.061
- Raise the shoulder.
- Arrgh!

29:44.700 --> 29:46.532
Hetty?

29:46.702 --> 29:48.614
Who the hell did I shoot?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.995
Herman. He's my brother.

29:51.164 --> 29:54.032
But I didn't have anything
to do with it, I swear.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.996
Eating 20 people?

29:57.296 --> 29:59.037
What does Mama Olive think?

29:59.214 --> 30:01.171
What did you do with her?

30:01.341 --> 30:03.879
It's Mama. She got him.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.884
- I'm sorry.
- Got who?

30:06.054 --> 30:07.841
She's hungry. Starving.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.722
Mama Olive is the cannibal?

30:09.891 --> 30:11.723
Yeah.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.594
Dolls!

30:14.771 --> 30:16.387
Dolls?

30:16.565 --> 30:18.602
Dolls!

30:24.281 --> 30:26.398
You did see the 'no trespassing' sign,
didn't you?

30:26.575 --> 30:29.363
Uh, I was wondering, um...

30:29.536 --> 30:31.152
I need to talk with you.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.788
And you think an $8 bottle of pinot's
gonna make me listen?

30:33.957 --> 30:35.914
Hell, no.
No, the wine's mostly for me.

30:36.084 --> 30:39.998
My favourite uncle in the world
just left me this.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.915
Curtis McCreedy.
I shoulda known.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.629
Hurry up.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.670
Move your ass.
You better not be lying.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.055
She'd take him to her cellar.
I swear.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.800
I never liked you, you know?

30:53.977 --> 30:55.684
I have a gun at your back,
you idiot!

30:55.854 --> 30:57.720
I'll make you a deal.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.560
Take Mama.

30:59.733 --> 31:03.443
- She's a cold, hard harpy.
- Thought I had a bad childhood.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.108
Dolls!

31:06.281 --> 31:07.863
Dolls!

31:08.033 --> 31:09.953
Hermie made sure that
no-one would ever be heard.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.464
Where's the key?

31:26.551 --> 31:29.840
I ask the earth
to give up this ash.

31:31.139 --> 31:35.179
I ask the air
to silence its name.

31:37.062 --> 31:41.898
I ask the water
to cleanse this girl.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.898
I ask the fire...

31:48.448 --> 31:50.064
to loosen its hold.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.742
Free from the tethers,
purified by the elements,

31:57.916 --> 32:00.124
Waverly Earp,
you are now open to receive

32:00.293 --> 32:02.956
this fragment of man
into your life.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.746
Do you accept?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.915
I do.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.584
Wait, did I just marry a skull?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.845
You are connected.
You are as one.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.183
The keeper of the bones and the
Stone Witch's... son.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.554
OK, what have I done?

32:21.731 --> 32:23.347
When I bonded Curtis
to the skull,

32:23.525 --> 32:25.357
I didn't know whose it was,
it never told me.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.727
What? She's gonna be coming for me.
I need protection.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.192
- I need to find some salt.
- What?

32:30.365 --> 32:32.322
Who's coming? Am I in danger?

32:32.492 --> 32:36.111
Of course you are. I mean,
this is what it means to be blessed.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.245
You poor sweet girl,
what was Curtis thinking?

32:44.546 --> 32:46.162
Wynonna!

32:46.339 --> 32:47.955
She can't hear you.

32:48.133 --> 32:51.626
Say your prayers, sweetheart.

32:53.513 --> 32:57.257
I got a hollow place in my belly
that needs to be filled.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.220
- Hurry up.
- I'm trying.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.557
If you know where they are
and you're not telling me...

33:04.649 --> 33:06.265
I swear I don't.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.776
Look, I need you to understand.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.187
See, we didn't have a daddy.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.026
Mama had some money,
but she put it all

33:13.200 --> 33:14.816
into an old hotel
and restaurant.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.753
Back then, if food didn't have
maggots in it,

33:16.828 --> 33:18.444
they practically gave it
a Michelin star.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.238
OK, no more food talk.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.247
Ms Olive, you don't
have to live like this.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.896
We can take you somewhere where
people understand what you are.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.583
Now, you think
I'm some fragile old lady?

33:27.756 --> 33:31.249
Back then, you lived and died
by what the seasons gave ya.

33:33.220 --> 33:36.258
Winter fell, a year of blizzards
worse than anybody had seen.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.967
Livestock died, deer vanished,

33:38.141 --> 33:39.911
the root cellar got emptied
months before spring.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.348
So, what, did you eat
the hotel guests?

33:44.689 --> 33:46.305
You did!

33:46.483 --> 33:49.726
Damn right I did,
and I would do it again.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.690
Loved it.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.856
- You loved the taste?
- Nothing else compared.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.492
Then one day, a certain marshal
came into town

33:58.662 --> 34:00.574
investigating
some missing people.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.613
Great-great-granddaddy
Wyatt Earp.

34:02.791 --> 34:06.410
Herman was all, "We gotta
protect Mama." Such a suck-up.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.293
He was a good boy. Yeah.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.956
- He fought for his mama!
- Ahh!

34:12.132 --> 34:16.002
- And Hetty?
- She was useless. Born that way.

34:16.179 --> 34:19.672
Me? I just got caught in the crossfire
and became this.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.887
- I didn't choose it and it's not fair.
- Believe me, I get that.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.723
I just want to live like a girl.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.764
- Buy lip gloss, wear flirty skirts.
- Did you find the keys?

34:27.940 --> 34:31.935
Girls don't have
them chances that boys have.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.103
I learned that the hard way.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.614
I didn't want Hetty
to go through that.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.866
Mama dressed me
like a boy, then like a man.

34:39.034 --> 34:42.527
She looked like Herman.
Very much like twins.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.822
Couldn't tell us apart.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.829
Oww!

34:48.003 --> 34:50.335
Right down to
the goddamn tattoo.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.121
Laser removal.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.585
Greatest invention
of the 20th century.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.258
Ha! Got 'em.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.926
Ahh! Oh, the hunger!

35:05.103 --> 35:08.346
Oh, Herman,
he was such a good boy.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.435
He always brought
his mama dinner.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.249
He won't be bringing you
anything anymore.

35:12.402 --> 35:14.189
He can't help you.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.146
But I can, OK?

35:17.324 --> 35:20.988
You are gonna be deeeee-licious!

35:25.707 --> 35:27.323
Your friend is already dead.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.116
She's eaten
and she's stronger now.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.378
- You open it, I don't know what she'll do.
- Shut up and help me.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.539
There's something...

35:35.550 --> 35:38.634
There's something wrong
with you. You're spoiled!

35:38.803 --> 35:42.046
Yeah. I'm an acquired taste.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.966
Dolls? Please don't be eaten!

35:45.143 --> 35:47.305
- I'm OK.
- Can you get the ladder up?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.812
I'm not that OK.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.023
- You can't get both me and Mama.
- I like to think big.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.651
Toss me the cuffs!

36:00.283 --> 36:03.867
OK.

36:04.871 --> 36:07.579
You know, everyone's right about you -
you are a bitch.

36:07.749 --> 36:10.787
Yeah. A bitch with
some hella sexy moves.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.498
Cool.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.510
She was the one
who wanted to kill your daddy.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.841
And now I'm going to kill you.

36:27.769 --> 36:31.012
You OK?

36:34.401 --> 36:37.189
Holy shit, she took the door!

36:50.667 --> 36:53.034
You almost had me, Hetty.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.045
One helluva sob story.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.667
It's all true.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.553
Except you left out the part
about wanting my daddy dead.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.306
Each time an heir came of age,

37:07.475 --> 37:10.513
Mama would get ravenous
and then murderous.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.596
Killing Ward
was the only way to stop her.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.264
So you are the sixth.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.111
This curse
won't end until you end.

37:21.281 --> 37:24.649
Funny. I feel the exact
same way about you.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.993
Make your peace.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.382
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:45.555 --> 37:48.969
- Good job.
- I know.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.929
OK, let's go get my gun.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.802
Can't we just enjoy the moment
for once?

37:53.980 --> 37:55.812
Earp.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.024
Coming.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.582
Hey, thanks for bringing
my lunch.

38:19.756 --> 38:22.624
- Was it any trouble?
- Of course it was.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.633
Do you know what they'll do
if they find out

38:24.803 --> 38:26.419
I smuggled that from the lab?

38:26.596 --> 38:28.212
They track that shit
like it's plutonium.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.429
Look, I just needed enough
to tide me over, alright?

38:30.558 --> 38:33.596
Whatever you did
to get yourself cut off,

38:33.770 --> 38:35.386
undo it.

38:35.563 --> 38:40.183
The people upstairs
want results.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.976
Don't call me again.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.285
Doc, now's not a good time.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.374
Just so you know,
my mission was for naught.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.228
Yeah, you said you'd get
something on Bobo.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.207
Well, I couldn't
get close enough.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.965
You OK there, partner?

39:10.974 --> 39:14.638
Our deal's off. I think it is
time for you to leave, OK?

39:14.811 --> 39:16.768
I see what is happening
to you, OK?

39:16.938 --> 39:18.554
The sweating,
the skittery disposition,

39:18.731 --> 39:21.474
the stink of desperation
for the drug.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.768
Whatever it may be.

39:23.945 --> 39:26.562
- Get out of my way.
- I want CC Stone.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.446
And I...

39:28.616 --> 39:30.528
I want you gone.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.614
Leave Wynonna alone.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.574
You're gonna get her killed.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.449
At least I wouldn't be
in withdrawal when I did.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.042
I know what you really are.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.580
Competition?

39:44.757 --> 39:46.373
The enemy.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.043
Just so's we're clear, then.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.931
Well, that's awfully optimistic.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.854
Sure, it's winter now,
but a girl's gotta be ready.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.738
You never know
when a clear stretch of road

40:09.908 --> 40:11.615
and the right moment
will come along.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.276
I see.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.116
You get what you wanted
from Dolls?

40:16.289 --> 40:17.905
Oh, I got something better.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.698
I'm surprised
he was so accommodating.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.993
- He's been acting really...
- Yeah.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.332
Well, never trust
a man with a badge.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.622
I carried one for years,
so, you know...

40:26.799 --> 40:28.586
I do trust him.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.923
Mmm.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.672
And what about you, Ms Earp?

40:37.936 --> 40:39.723
Are you getting what you wanted?

40:43.274 --> 40:46.267
Let's just say, when I do,
it doesn't make me any happier.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.481
Happiness is a myth.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.567
No.

40:50.740 --> 40:54.029
No. I had it before, it's real.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.818
And it's worth fighting for.

40:55.995 --> 41:00.239
Well, I can remember
a glorious time not so long ago

41:00.416 --> 41:02.032
when I was very happy.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.499
Well, the trouble
with glorious times...

41:06.714 --> 41:08.580
they don't tend to stick.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.294
But friends do.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.966
Friends. Sure.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.357
Feel like some company?

41:29.070 --> 41:31.107
I think I'm better
travelling solo.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.523
For now.

41:38.955 --> 41:40.742
Come on, come on, come on.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.099
OK.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.558
One, two, three.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.364
Ahh!
