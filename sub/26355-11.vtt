can we do that again?

00:37.938 --> 00:39.573
Maybe a little more energy?

Okay, Peter, your main job here
is to go in rooms before me

Washington, D.C. is
a wonderful city to call home.

Yeah, Meg, trust me--

before long,
we'll fit right in here,

Oh, you can't go home yet!

03:02.283 --> 03:03.817
We haven't even served dinner.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.753
And I hope
you saved your appetite,

Folks, to drink this evening,
we've got red wine,

03:20.033 --> 03:21.935
white wine,
and a fifth of bourbon.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.039

07:31.151 --> 07:32.786

throw away in one day

poof, gone in a day!

That's ridiculous!

07:45.432 --> 07:46.967
How could you not believe me?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.636
Oh, hang on. CNN's on,

07:57.678 --> 07:59.079

07:59.112 --> 08:00.581
You think giving them amnesty

08:00.614 --> 08:02.315
is fair to the people
who are already here?

08:02.349 --> 08:04.151
They're contributing
to the economy.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.252

08:05.285 --> 08:06.654
Amnesty is never the answer.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.455
It's not amnesty.

already on the books.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.761

08:47.795 --> 08:49.296
Sorry, Meg, I got to go to work.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.464
What? You're still gonna work
for that man

08:51.498 --> 08:53.133

08:53.166 --> 08:55.468

08:57.237 --> 08:59.707

08:59.740 --> 09:02.475
the Sleepy Hollow guy
for some reason.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.722

09:17.190 --> 09:19.226
The mark on his hand--

09:19.259 --> 09:21.361
was it a bow?

09:26.900 --> 09:30.537
Oh, no.
No, no, no, it can't be.

09:34.875 --> 09:38.578
When I cut off his head.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.083
Okay, I'll take your questions.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.584
Me With A Fake Mustache.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.920
America wants to know
what you're packin' up there.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.856
I've heard 11 inches. True?

09:48.889 --> 09:50.023
All right,
that's enough from you.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.358
Me With A Funny Hat.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.060
I also have heard 11 inches.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.062
Okay, any non-11-inch questions?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.563
Me With An Old-Timey Wig.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.899
I've heard four handbreadths.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.172
Mr. President, the press
briefing went very well.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.740
Many people are saying

10:06.774 --> 10:08.976
it was the best press briefing
in all of history.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.578
Mr. Griffin, you're not speaking
to President Trump.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.313
That's a butternut squash.

10:13.346 --> 10:17.317
Oh. Well, if this lumpy orange
garbage vegetable is here,

10:17.350 --> 10:19.753
then where's
President Donald Trump?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.421
Mr. President, please,

10:21.454 --> 10:22.923
I'm not interested.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.557
You'll regret this.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.994
(speaks Huttese)

10:28.428 --> 10:31.098
(cackling)

10:33.033 --> 10:34.234
Oh, my God.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.236
Bob's Burgers is on!

10:36.269 --> 10:38.872
This show speaks
to us young people, apparently.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.574
That show-- and-and I mean
no disrespect when I say this--

10:41.608 --> 10:44.644
but that show looks like
it was animated in a moving car.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.514
And again, no disrespect,
wonderful people over there,

10:47.547 --> 10:50.483
but... oh, my God, President
Trump is assaulting Meg!

10:50.517 --> 10:52.920
I can't believe what
I just saw, Mr. President!

10:52.953 --> 10:54.755
What would your third wife,

10:54.788 --> 10:57.758
the soft-core girl-on-girl
porn lady, think about this?

10:57.791 --> 11:01.094
Or the actual porn star
your lawyer paid hush money to?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.764
I'm so sorry we didn't
believe you earlier, sweetie.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.433
Yeah, where do you get off
behaving like this?

11:06.466 --> 11:08.802
-Why shouldn't I? You do.
-What?

11:08.836 --> 11:12.239
When you walked through that
door, you insulted Bob's Burgers

11:12.272 --> 11:14.507
and the hundreds of people
who work there.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.509
Well, I was just kidding around.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.511
No, you weren't.
You're just jealous

11:18.545 --> 11:21.481
'cause it wins all the Emmys
and the kids love it.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.683
You seem to know a lot
about Bob's Burgers.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.352
Of course I do.

11:25.385 --> 11:29.122
Bob's Burgers
is my favorite animated show.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.524
Wow. There's your headline,
Emmy voters.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.626
Vote your conscience.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.362
Anyway, my point is,

11:35.395 --> 11:38.598
if Peter Griffin gets to be
a jerk all the time,

11:38.631 --> 11:41.001
then why can't Donald Trump?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.635
Huh.

11:42.669 --> 11:46.273
That is not the...
dumbest thing you've ever said.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.308
So are we square?

11:49.342 --> 11:50.410
No.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.445
No, President Trump, we are not!

11:52.479 --> 11:53.680
I quit!

11:53.713 --> 11:55.148
-What?
-That's right.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.550
And you know what else?
My days of being mean

11:57.584 --> 11:58.718
and insulting are over!

11:58.752 --> 12:00.253
From here on out,

12:00.287 --> 12:02.489
I'm gonna be the nice,
kind Peter Griffin.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.591
You can't walk out on me.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.659
I'm the president.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.295
Well, you're not
a very good one.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.396
Like that guy.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.364
Or-or that one.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.732
Or that one.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.367
Hey, which one is that, anyway?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.969
I'm Grover Cleveland,

12:16.003 --> 12:18.671
the only president to be married
in the White House.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.874
Oh, what a nice story.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.110
It's a great story.
I married a girl

12:23.143 --> 12:26.546
who I'd raised since
the time she was 11 years old.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.649
-Oh.
-Well, that guy's
not getting a musical.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.258
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return
to Pirates of the Caribbean,

12:38.291 --> 12:40.727
where the sound guy
put the microphone too close

12:40.760 --> 12:43.096
to Johnny Depp's
jangling bracelets.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.498

-Hold it right there, Sparrow.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.600
This is the day
you will always remember

12:47.634 --> 12:50.503
as the day you almost caught
Captain Jack Sparrow.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.139
-What?!
-I said...

12:52.172 --> 12:54.241
-(jangling continues)
-I've spent $65 million

12:54.274 --> 12:56.543
on vacation homes
and daytime wine.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.512

12:59.546 --> 13:01.514
All right, turn off

better than that now.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.052
-What?
-You heard me.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.987
We are done being mean
and insulting,

13:07.020 --> 13:09.022
like Donald Trump is.
From now on,

13:09.056 --> 13:11.624
this family's
gonna be nice and supportive.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.526
Oh. So if we're being nice now,

13:13.560 --> 13:16.263
maybe you have nice things
to say to me, Dad.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.998
Uh... of course I do.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.300

13:20.333 --> 13:22.903

13:22.936 --> 13:25.538
You're a... hat owner.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.440
You're also hatted.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.942
Why does he keep
coming back to the hat?

13:28.976 --> 13:31.344
Peter, stop.
Your nipples are bleeding.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.813
All right, fine,

couldn't keep this up.

in the final round.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.203
I'll tell you one thing, I'm
not gonna miss Washington, D.C.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.540
Well, we had a lot of fun this
week and changed zero minds.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.009
If you want to learn more
about our president,

20:43.042 --> 20:45.011
consult the Steele dossier,

20:45.044 --> 20:47.179
which is all about
getting peed on.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.181
He also, with whole heart
and full throat,

20:49.215 --> 20:51.751
endorsed a pedophile
for the United States Senate.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.920
That didn't fit
into tonight's narrative,

20:53.953 --> 20:55.522
but should not be forgotten.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.557
And I am a proud hat owner.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.258
Shut up, Meg.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.595
From our family to yours,
we're very frightened.
