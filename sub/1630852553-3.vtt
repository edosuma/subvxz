about Ally Allston?

00:06.049 --> 00:07.659
- She was responsible
for a woman's death.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.531

00:09.574 --> 00:11.402

00:13.448 --> 00:15.406
They are painting a target
on your back! Who was it?

00:15.450 --> 00:17.017
- It was my sister, Lucy.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.888
If I hadn't found her,
she would have died.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.064

01:29.915 --> 01:32.222
I had another vision

01:32.266 --> 01:34.877
It's completely debilitating.

that happens?

01:48.282 --> 01:49.544

visit from Lois Lane

02:08.650 --> 02:10.347

03:14.498 --> 03:16.239
Did she say anything to you?

03:16.283 --> 03:18.502
- Just that she hated keeping
that secret from you,

03:18.546 --> 03:20.852
which, I mean,
maybe you can sympathize with?

03:20.896 --> 03:23.551
You know, the whole half-alien,

to be honest with her

03:36.694 --> 03:38.305
about your powers one day,

03:38.348 --> 03:40.132
would you want her

04:02.938 --> 04:05.288

He'll know.
