extra, extra fun!

07:20.570 --> 07:22.093
Man, what's up
with your boy, bro?

07:22.137 --> 07:24.356
GATA: Man, I see how it is.
Y'all trying to turn me down.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.619
You dig what I'm saying?

07:25.662 --> 07:26.707
-Oh, yeah.
-Yo, yo.

07:26.750 --> 07:27.708
Yeah! Huh-huh!

07:27.751 --> 07:29.187
You're doing too much right now.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.146
-Too much, like what?
-Chill, baby.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.756
I'm not about to chill.
I'm gonna go to the front,

07:32.800 --> 07:34.541
'cause it's real in the front,
baby. Let's go.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.630
'Cause it's party time.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.502
Can't take that no more,
bro, he got to roll.

07:39.546 --> 07:43.288
-Like rollroll-type.
-All right. Say less, man.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.160
GATA:
I'm staying up here,
man, I swear.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.727
My bad. That's your girl.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.293
[Gata continues indistinctly]

07:48.337 --> 07:50.557
My little gander.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.558
They trippin' on me.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.168
-Yo, you got to go.
-Aw, come on, man.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.735
You really about
to kick me off the bus?

07:54.778 --> 07:56.388
-Let me just holla at you...
-Come on, Nutti,

07:56.432 --> 07:58.434
don't do me like this, man,let me get one more chance, bro.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.527
So, I mixed all
your favorite primary colors,

08:04.571 --> 08:06.007
and then I pulled pics
off your socials,

08:06.050 --> 08:08.226
and they'll be projected
on-screen behind you.

08:08.270 --> 08:11.447
I just feel like you're makingme look very lame or something.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.667
Makingyou?

08:13.710 --> 08:15.538
DAVE:
And by the way,
I think this is funny and a...

08:15.582 --> 08:18.019
very valid attempt--
I just think, I'm already

08:18.062 --> 08:21.457
kind of in an uphill battle hereopening up for Meek Mill,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.111
'cause his crowd
isn't necessarily my crowd,

08:23.154 --> 08:25.461
and I don't need to,
like, double down

08:25.505 --> 08:28.769
and remind everybody, "Hey,if you didn't know I was white,

08:28.812 --> 08:30.771
Jewish and suburban and a loser,

08:30.814 --> 08:33.643
just look behind me
and you'll reallyknow it.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.993
You know? Like,
I'm not sure they'll like it.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.430
When did you start caring
about what other people want?

08:38.474 --> 08:40.694
Since, like,

08:40.737 --> 08:42.565
pretty much, like, now.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.436
'Cause it's, like,
a very real thing.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.786
-David.
-Yeah.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.396
-Stop.
-Okay.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.050
Well, I-I just think
I'd feel much better about it

08:49.093 --> 08:52.183
if we could lock downa great representation visually

08:52.227 --> 08:53.620
of what my brand is.

08:53.663 --> 08:57.711
Okay, so, how exactly would youdescribe your brand?

08:57.754 --> 08:59.626
Like, aesthetically
or "cinematographically,"

08:59.669 --> 09:00.627
if that's a word...

09:00.670 --> 09:02.629
-It's not.-...I feel like it's everything

09:02.672 --> 09:06.197
you loved about the classic
movies of our childhood.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.286
Like Sandlot, Billy Madison,

09:08.330 --> 09:10.637
Apocalypse Now,
Happy Gilmore, Clueless.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.638
But at the same time,

09:11.681 --> 09:13.640
I feel like my brand
is not rooted in the past.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.293
It's actually
very forward-thinking

09:15.337 --> 09:16.643
-and, like, futuristic.
-Mm-hmm.

09:16.686 --> 09:17.861
-Mm-hmm.
-It's like, imagine, like,

09:17.905 --> 09:20.081
what 2090 is like.

09:20.124 --> 09:24.607
But, like, it's being describedby someone who's from 1920.

09:24.651 --> 09:25.608
Mm-hmm.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.175
Yeah.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.176
Okay.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.613
Like this?

09:30.657 --> 09:31.614
To me,

09:31.658 --> 09:33.703
it says,
"Don't give too many notes

09:33.747 --> 09:35.879
to the person
doing this shit for free."

09:35.923 --> 09:37.881
All right, well, I...

09:37.925 --> 09:40.623
won't give you any more notes,
then, I guess.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.192
I'll do one more pass.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.498
-Thanks, slug.

-What the fuck, bro?
-It's just exactly what
any rapper would do.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.017
Don't you want to be a rapper?

10:27.061 --> 10:28.236
Bro, what's wrong?
What do you want me to do?

10:28.279 --> 10:29.890
I can do anything, bro.
I'm like a magician, bro.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.543
Look at these notes. I'vebeen plotting and jotting, bro.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.893
I've been thinking
about this shit all night.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.242
The best show of yourlife,

10:34.285 --> 10:35.765
and I'm treating it
like it's my life.

10:35.809 --> 10:36.897
Let's do this shit
together, bro.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.028
DAVE
It's not a you thing.
You're doing great.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.551
I'm just thinking, like,
shouldn't I be doing

10:39.595 --> 10:41.553
more, like,
Andy Kaufman-like stuff?

10:41.597 --> 10:43.817
Like stunts,
like sitting onstage,

10:43.860 --> 10:44.818
like, cross-legged,
smoking a cigar.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.820
Maybe not even open my mouth
and talk.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.691
I just sit there,
like, experiment socially.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.780
Oh, you're trying to be
on some undercover rap shit,

10:50.824 --> 10:52.303
like James Bond.
When the last time

10:52.347 --> 10:54.088
you seen James Bond take a shitin any of his movies?

10:54.131 --> 10:55.742
Have you seen James Bond take
a shit in any of his movies?

10:55.785 --> 10:57.874
I mean, I don't think
they film shit like that

10:57.918 --> 10:59.136
in movies just in general.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.834
But, hey, preach, brother.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.487
Okay, you right.'Cause everything I say is real.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.706
Everything I say needs
to be on a T-shirt.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
Come on, bro.
If you want

11:05.752 --> 11:06.927
the Andy Kaufman shit,
put it up there.

11:06.970 --> 11:07.884
Hologram, bro. You're LD.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.756
Get a fucking hologram.
You could do anything, bro.

11:09.799 --> 11:10.974
-Hol...
-Don't you think
he can get a hologram?

11:11.018 --> 11:11.888
We need to get one
of them holograms,

11:11.932 --> 11:13.977
for real, for real.
Call the venue, bro.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.762
Yeah, no. No,
we're not getting a hologram.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.720
-You can't afford rent, so no.
-I'm just trying

11:17.764 --> 11:20.201
to figure out, like,
what is unique to Lil Dicky.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.768
Like, who is Lil Dicky?

11:21.811 --> 11:23.291
What is something
only he would do?

11:23.334 --> 11:25.293
Or I would d-- Or--
Fuck, this is confusing.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.730
Suck your own dick onstage.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.950
Can I do that? Legally?

11:29.993 --> 11:31.212
Can I suck my own dick onstage?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.345
That's a real question?

11:34.389 --> 11:36.783
You're asking me
about being able

11:36.826 --> 11:38.349
to suck your own penis
in front of...

11:38.393 --> 11:39.437
Legally. I'm just-- Legally.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.439
Can you even do that
in real life?

11:41.483 --> 11:44.094
I believe I can.I used to as a kid. Oh, my God.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.400
I stopped doing it
at a certain point,

11:45.443 --> 11:46.967
'cause it felt more
like giving head

11:47.010 --> 11:48.098
than getting it, but...

11:48.142 --> 11:49.970
ELZ:
Did you even come or anything?

11:50.013 --> 11:51.188
-DAVE: Uh...
-Oh, my God.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.624
Don't tell me you swallowed.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.625
I, like, kind of...

11:53.669 --> 11:55.845
It was like a neck hair thing...

11:55.889 --> 11:56.977
So you pulled out of your mouthand then you shot it

11:57.020 --> 11:58.761
-and you caught it in your neck?-Yes.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.154
What are you, a Globetrotter?
[chuckles]

12:00.197 --> 12:02.112
Yeah, I didn't--
Like I said, it was a burden.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.810
-[whoops]
-I stopped doing it for
that reason. I'm just saying,

12:03.853 --> 12:04.811
if it was legal, it's, like,

12:04.854 --> 12:05.812
definitely
an interesting visual.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.378
Okay, if not that...

12:07.422 --> 12:09.032
So we're gonna make that video,like I said,

12:09.076 --> 12:11.034
that shows exactly
who Lil Dicky is.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.557
-No gimmicks, no bullshit.-But you're not listening to me.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.559
I don't even know
who Lil Dicky is.

12:14.603 --> 12:15.560
Like, that's what I'm saying.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.561
Like, I'm trying
to figure it out.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.780
I don't even know
what this thing is yet.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.477
What Lil Dicky is?
He a legend, bro.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.349
Ain't you TTG, trained to go?
Let's go, baby.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.698
We going straight
to the mountaintop.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.047
Mount Rushmore-type shit.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.135
Let's go over here,
do what we got to do.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.137
Let's gander,
wiggle up, hit the stage.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.922
Me and him.
Bret Hart, Owen Hart,

12:28.965 --> 12:30.924
jumping off the top row.
You know what I mean?

12:30.967 --> 12:32.708
Let's Super Smash Brother
these hoes, bro.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.710
-Listen to me, bro. Come on.
-Gata!

12:34.754 --> 12:35.972
Dude, you need to calm down.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.018
Listen to yourself, bro.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.066
My bad, y'all.

12:43.110 --> 12:43.893
I'm-a go get some water
over here.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.811
This is your fault.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.728
[whispering]:
I don't know.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.121
It's a lot.

12:56.123 --> 12:59.082
Ma, when the last time you beento Chick-fil-A on Expo and Fig?

12:59.126 --> 13:00.997
Ooh, I don't feel like going
to Expo and Fig.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.999
What? They got the best sauce,
the best service.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.436
But we got food at home,
already paid for.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.090
-Thank you.
-Already paid for?
Ain't nobody worried

13:07.134 --> 13:09.527
-about the price of Chick-fil-A.-Well, I know you're not,

13:09.571 --> 13:12.182
after what you just spent
on the same pair of shoes

13:12.226 --> 13:14.402
-in different colors.
-Aw, hell no!

13:14.445 --> 13:17.927
-I know you ain't in here buyingshoes. You still owe me money.
-Relax, bro. Come on.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.624
-Ain't about to relax, bro. Youknow what time it is with me.
-Just relax, bro.

13:19.668 --> 13:20.843
In front of all these people?
It's not that serious.

13:20.887 --> 13:21.844
I don't care about them people,fool.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.106
Either you gonna run me
my money, bro,

13:23.150 --> 13:24.673
or you gonna take them shoes
back right now, bro.

13:24.716 --> 13:25.674
-I'm not playing with you.
-I know you see me working

13:25.717 --> 13:27.067
with Pacman da Gunman, Wayne...

13:27.110 --> 13:28.024
I don't care about none
of that make-believe,

13:28.068 --> 13:29.243
-fairy-tale shit, bro.
-Bro, just chill.

13:29.286 --> 13:30.505
-Okay, look. Here.
-Bro, take them shoes back.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.072
How much money does he owe you?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.638
Ma'am, I wouldn't take
no money from you.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.640
-I promise you, I wouldn't.
-Bro, it's all good.
You know what?

13:35.684 --> 13:36.903
Come on, big homey.
Let's go. It's all love.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.034
-A'ight.
-Okay, look. Here, I'll...

13:38.078 --> 13:39.775
Hey, bang the register, man.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.298
-I got to make a return.-That's what I'm talking about.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.952
-Okay, uh...
-CAZ: Yeah.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.215
I just got to give
a-a reason for the return.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.130
'Cause he's a bitch-ass nigga.
That's why.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.915
-Oh. All right.
-[types]

13:48.958 --> 13:50.568
I'm-a remember that, bro.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.005
Here.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.136
Punk, no,
that's my money, nigga.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.094
-Give me the receipt.
-Man, you know what?

13:54.137 --> 13:55.225
I can't believe this.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.879
He don't even know I'm poppin'
like that, bro.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.012
It's gonna be all good, bro.
The whole world

13:59.055 --> 14:01.797
gonna see how poppin' I am.
I'm-a have all of this, bro.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.451
Man, fuck all these shoes.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.105
All this shit gonna be mine!

14:05.148 --> 14:06.933

15:03.641 --> 15:05.817
and we'll see
how you go from there.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.602
Can you see how I dowith a commissary burrito, man?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.299
I ain't ate shit

15:09.343 --> 15:11.736
Yeah, I'll get you a burrito.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.956
-Thank you, Doctor.
-I can't believe this.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.220

It's okay.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.449
You're just sitting there,

15:28.492 --> 15:30.016
just looking at me like--

15:30.059 --> 15:31.365
letting the doctor talk to me

15:31.408 --> 15:33.149

15:35.195 --> 15:36.674
Like,
you just let him walk away.

15:36.718 --> 15:39.155
Talking about some pills
I don't even know about.

Damn, another rehearsal
tomorrow, bro?

15:50.427 --> 15:52.690
-Damn, I'm there.
-And if I'm being honest,

15:52.734 --> 15:55.258
we got to be a lot more focused than we were today,

15:55.302 --> 15:57.130
'cause it was all over the placeand...

15:57.173 --> 15:58.131
Bring it, okay?

15:58.174 --> 15:59.175
I need to get that filled.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.047
Hello?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.701
-Thank you.
-Hello? Gata.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.921
-Hello!
-Oh, yeah. I'm listening, bro.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.357
You know me. I'm just fucking
with some bitches.

16:07.401 --> 16:10.578
All right, Gata, like,
I can't even express

16:10.621 --> 16:12.275
how important this show is,
okay?

16:12.319 --> 16:13.581
So please do not disappoint me.

16:13.624 --> 16:16.018
Come on, bro.
Does molasses drip on trees?

16:16.062 --> 16:19.021
That adage is not one
I'm familiar with,

16:19.065 --> 16:20.501
but sure.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.068
I got to go.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.287
Goodbye.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.072
I am so sorry about that,

16:26.115 --> 16:29.075
but I need to get that dosage
and prescription filled ASAP.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.077
Is this for seizures
or mood stabilization?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.078
The last one.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.079
Have you had this dosage before?

16:33.122 --> 16:34.515
Y'all just gonna stand there
and watch?

16:34.558 --> 16:36.647
Nah, I never had this dosage,
but my doctor told me

16:36.691 --> 16:38.519
if I find myself,
like, ramping up,

16:38.562 --> 16:40.651
that I need to get this dosage.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.392
All right.
Give me 30 minutes, okay?

16:42.436 --> 16:44.655
Thank you.

I could, but I gave this one

17:19.821 --> 17:21.344
to some other rapper.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.303
So...

17:23.346 --> 17:24.869
Are you joking, or no,
you're being serious?

17:24.913 --> 17:27.568
You gave the beat that you
were holding for me away

17:27.611 --> 17:30.136
to a different rapper? I-I've
been working on that song.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.355
For three months, you've
been working on that beat?

17:32.399 --> 17:34.314
Yeah, it takes me... years
to write a song sometimes.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.446
I've been putting in
so many hours over that beat.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.535
-You just gave it away?
-Okay, so let me ask you
a question.

17:38.579 --> 17:41.582
If, let's say, Beyoncé was like,"Yo, Elz, I need a beat

17:41.625 --> 17:43.105
right now." Her and Jay
want to go put out an album,

17:43.149 --> 17:45.368
and I'm gonna give 'em beats,
and for some reason

17:45.412 --> 17:48.023
you have the fucking beat that
I gave you three months ago...

17:48.067 --> 17:49.111
-Yeah.
-...to use.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.547
If you said, "Yeah,
I'm holding it for you."

17:50.591 --> 17:52.027
And they started working
on it, and they're like,

17:52.071 --> 17:53.289
"You know what...?"
Okay, actually forget it.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.464
-It depends.
-Whatever, whatever.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.031
It's your beat-- you own me.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.554
You can take any beat
of mine you want.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.991
If anybody else, if Kanye West
asks me for a beat

18:00.035 --> 18:02.168
and you have it,
it's yours, take the beat.

Well, don't make me
feel bad about it.

fucking beat, enjoy it.

a heads up or I don't know...

18:08.391 --> 18:10.524
-We can talk about it...
-And here's the heads up.

18:10.567 --> 18:11.525
I don't, I mean, I understand.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.004

-Is it over?
-No.

You're bipolar?

20:36.931 --> 20:40.326
I have a chemical imbalance
going on inside my brain.

I take eight to ten pills

the other day
I felt myself ramping up,

20:50.814 --> 20:52.512
I took too much, and it
probably fucked me up, man.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.253
Look at me, man.

20:55.906 --> 21:00.563
It's much harder
to stay mad at this point.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.565

a rat in a hole sometimes.
