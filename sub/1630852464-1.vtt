WEBVTT

01:32.092 --> 01:32.968
What?

01:35.721 --> 01:36.889
Wolf!

01:36.972 --> 01:38.932
-Get out of my way!
-Move!

01:39.016 --> 01:40.017
Lord, save us.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.148
Back. Stay back! Back.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.926
Sweet Mother Divine, save us.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.099
Oh, my God!

02:22.434 --> 02:23.477
No!

02:43.330 --> 02:45.207
You're a Wolfwalker?

02:46.458 --> 02:47.459
Thank you.

03:58.530 --> 04:02.826
Wolf, wolf, kill the wolf
Hunt them far and yonder

04:02.910 --> 04:07.706
Wolf, wolf, kill the wolf
Till all the wolves are done for

04:10.792 --> 04:13.629
See that, Merlyn? Right on the nose.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.635
What are you saying?
I was aiming for the nose.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.720
I'm glad you agree.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.055
Robyn.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.389
Yes, Father?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.851
Busy with your chores, I assume?

04:27.935 --> 04:28.936
Yes, Father.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.562
Practically finished.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.439
Seems you certainly haven't been idle.

04:32.523 --> 04:33.982
Oh, idle, no.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.402
I've been sweeping and dusting, mopping.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.154
Just can't keep up with it.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.954
I wonder what range that wolf poster is.
Fifteen feet?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.622
No way. Twenty at least.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.041
Although, I'm not sure.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.794
I haven't really considered it.
Too busy cleaning.

04:54.294 --> 04:59.007
Robyn, this is our new home. The bucket
and brush are your tools now, not this.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.677
It's so boring
being stuck in here all day.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.180
I should be out on adventures with you,
like we did back in England.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.892
Oh, lass. Lord Protector has strict rules.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.311
No children beyond the walls,
you know that.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.730
The forest is brimming with real wolves,

05:13.814 --> 05:16.024
and it's my job to hunt them down,
not yours.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.317
I'm not afraid of a wolf.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.861
You've never even seen a wolf.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.237
And I'm still not afraid.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.656
Yes, and that's why
I must be afraid for you.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.789
Well, I'll come with you to the gates.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.583
I'll be back before sundown.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.959
Stay indoors.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.052
Time to practice our tracking, Merlyn.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.137
Yes, now.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.771
Pies here!

05:54.855 --> 05:56.523
You find him, I'll follow.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.417
Fish! Fresh fish!

06:17.336 --> 06:18.504
Good work, Merlyn.

06:20.130 --> 06:24.176
Howls the wolf, wolf, wolf
Hears the wolf, wolf, wolf

06:24.259 --> 06:28.222
Run the wolf, wolf, wolf
Flee the wolf, wolf, wolf

06:28.305 --> 06:32.226
Howls the wolf, wolf, wolf
Hears the wolf, wolf, wolf

06:32.309 --> 06:34.019
Run the wolf, wolf, wolf

06:34.102 --> 06:38.440
Get your pickled oysters,
whelks and periwinkles!

06:38.524 --> 06:40.734
Wash it down with a cup of donkey's milk!

06:40.817 --> 06:41.944
Yuck.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.029
-Just two farthings.
-Where's he gone?

06:44.780 --> 06:47.449
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.076
Wolf, wolf, wolf

06:49.159 --> 06:53.080
Run the wolf, wolf, wolf
Flee the wolf, wolf, wolf

06:54.623 --> 06:55.916
Robyn.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.752
I was only gonna track you
as far as the gates.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.420
Really? Then what?

07:00.504 --> 07:03.131
Follow me out and slay
the pack of wolves single-handed?

07:03.215 --> 07:04.883
Yeah, but we could hunt them together.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.052
Wolves, bears, dragons, even!

07:07.886 --> 07:09.388
What am I to do with you?

07:11.974 --> 07:15.477
We could climb mountains and
see giants, meet witches who cast spells,

07:15.561 --> 07:17.563
find mermaids and selkies, even.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.066
Love, you and your fanciful stories.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.570
Wolf, wolf
Hears the wolf, wolf, wolf

07:24.653 --> 07:27.614
Howls the wolf, wolf, wolf
Run the wolf--

07:27.698 --> 07:29.157
Howls the wolf

07:29.825 --> 07:31.201
Goodfellowe!

07:31.285 --> 07:33.871
-Soldiers! Leg it!
-Goodfellowe! Come here a minute!

07:33.954 --> 07:35.998
Yes, sir! Stay here, lass.

07:36.081 --> 07:40.419
Shoot the wolf, wolf, wolf!
Hunt the wolf, wolf, wolf!

07:40.502 --> 07:44.298
Get the wolf, wolf, wolf!
Kill the wolf, wolf, wolf!

07:44.381 --> 07:48.468
Shoot the wolf, wolf, wolf!
Hunt the wolf, wolf, wolf!

07:48.552 --> 07:51.471
-Get the wolf, wolf, wolf!
-Got you now, wolf.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.474
Kill the wolf, wolf, wolf!
Shoot the wolf, wolf, wolf!

07:56.268 --> 08:00.355
Hey, English girl. Where do you think
you're going dressed like that?

08:00.439 --> 08:01.815
I'm a hunter.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.483
"I'm a hunter."

08:03.567 --> 08:06.236
Would you listen
to her fancy dancy accent?

08:06.320 --> 08:09.698
I am a hunter. Just like my father.
He's the best hunter there is.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.701
No, he's not. My father's the best hunter.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.746
Yeah? Well, we're hunting wolves
for the Lord Protector.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.707
Lord Protector put my father
in chains for nothing.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.251
You English think you're so great,
but you're not.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.086
You should all just go home.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.755
But first, give us a go on your crossbow.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.964
No!

08:27.674 --> 08:30.219
-You'll pay for that, English girl.
-She pushed him!

08:30.302 --> 08:32.221
You're dead now!

08:36.140 --> 08:38.852
-What's going on here?
-Soldier! Leg it!

08:52.032 --> 08:53.909
Why must you wander off like that, Robyn?

08:53.992 --> 08:56.119
I was trying to help you,
and then there was a boy,

08:56.203 --> 08:57.579
and he said his father
was better than you,

08:57.663 --> 09:00.040
-and then he wanted my crossbow and--
-Robyn!

09:00.123 --> 09:03.001
We are not so welcome in this land yet.

09:03.085 --> 09:07.005
You're better off to stay at home
while I'm working. You're safe there.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.715
But I'd be just as safe
out there with you.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.801
No, Robyn! Stay inside!

09:10.884 --> 09:12.010
Do as you're told.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.180
It's for your own good, Robyn.

09:16.598 --> 09:17.599
Look...

09:18.642 --> 09:21.979
this evening, when I'm back,
you can help me make new arrows.

09:23.105 --> 09:26.859
Tell me your stories of giants
and dragons. Would you like that?

09:26.942 --> 09:28.110
I suppose so.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.611
Now then, be good.

09:38.537 --> 09:41.582
No children beyond the walls.
Lord Protector's orders.

09:46.545 --> 09:50.048
If he could just see how good I am,
what a hunter I am,

09:50.132 --> 09:52.050
then he'd have to let me come along.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.387
What are you, Merlyn?
A falcon or a chicken?

09:59.391 --> 10:01.268
Kill the wolf! Kill the wolf!

10:01.351 --> 10:03.187
Leave me alone!

10:03.270 --> 10:04.646
Get away from me!

10:07.524 --> 10:09.109
Got you now, wolf!

10:11.737 --> 10:14.156
Lads, we got a flag! Come on!

10:14.656 --> 10:16.867
Down with the Lord Protector!

10:18.160 --> 10:20.829
-Stop this at once!
-Get out of here!

10:20.913 --> 10:23.123
-Get that flag!
-Get out of here, quickly!

10:25.042 --> 10:26.752
Go on, you little rebels, you!

10:27.878 --> 10:30.464
Well done!
Well done, boys Run! Run!

11:39.741 --> 11:41.034
Yes, I see it.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.122
I won't step in it.

12:05.225 --> 12:10.397
Help! Wolf! Wolf! Help!

12:10.480 --> 12:11.523
Wolf?

12:11.607 --> 12:15.068
Wolf! Merlyn, quick, fly. Find the wolf.

12:22.201 --> 12:23.827
Wolf!

12:23.911 --> 12:25.287
-Run!
-Get back! Get back!

12:25.370 --> 12:27.289
Run!

12:28.874 --> 12:30.000
Wolves!

12:39.176 --> 12:40.594
Get away! Get back!

12:42.095 --> 12:43.180
Help!

12:45.682 --> 12:47.768
Get back! Get back!

12:49.353 --> 12:51.855
Why, shoot! For God's sake, shoot!

13:05.202 --> 13:06.203
Merlyn!

13:29.434 --> 13:30.435
What?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.483
No! That's my bird! Leave him be!

13:38.443 --> 13:39.486
Stop!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.251
Robyn!

13:59.548 --> 14:01.925
-Robyn!
-Merlyn, he's gone!

14:02.009 --> 14:04.469
-We have to get him back.
-You could've been eaten alive.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.680
What were you thinking?
What are you doing out here?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.682
-I was trying to help you.
-Help me?

14:08.765 --> 14:11.852
I told you, you shouldn't be out here!
This is why!

14:11.935 --> 14:14.771
-Father, they took Merlyn.
-Lass, no.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.191
No, you're not going after him.
Not in there.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.442
But we can't leave him.

14:18.525 --> 14:22.070
Look, I promised your mother
I'd keep you safe.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.076
It's all right, love.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.997
You'll be safe back in the town. Come on.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.918
It's for your own good.

14:51.517 --> 14:54.520
By God, you're one lucky girl.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.356
Did you not see?
'Twas a Wolfwalker, by Crom!

14:57.439 --> 14:58.607
Now calm down, will you.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.817
Everyone knows you
can't be cutting down their woods.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.903
If you do, they'll get you.
Sure, that's the deal.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.488
There's no deal with anyone.

15:04.571 --> 15:09.451
Saint Patrick made it with the old pagans
and you're breaking it, you eejits!

15:09.535 --> 15:11.328
-We need to clear the woods.
-Did you not see?

15:11.411 --> 15:13.121
Actually, I did see the wolf attack.

15:13.205 --> 15:16.083
The way them wolves answered her call.

15:16.166 --> 15:19.378
Them forests is riddled with wolves,
I tell you.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.088
Won't be long before the wolves are gone.

15:21.171 --> 15:24.800
It won't be long before they're
inside the town walls with the hunger.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.011
No. No, we'll tame these lands.
The Lord Protector has ordered it.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.932
Ah, the great Lord Protector.

15:32.015 --> 15:35.561
Renowned for being true to his word.
Hilarious.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.938
At least the old king kept us safe.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.567
He's just an upstart. Lord Protector.

15:41.650 --> 15:44.403
Lord Protector.

15:44.486 --> 15:45.904
Protector of what?

15:45.988 --> 15:47.155
Come here!

15:47.239 --> 15:50.951
If you have grievances,
you should speak with me directly.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.077
What are you doing? No!

15:52.160 --> 15:54.997
-Get your hands off of--
-Hold still!

15:55.080 --> 15:58.125
-Jesus, Mary and Joseph. This is a joke.
-Get in.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.711
Let me out of here!

16:00.794 --> 16:03.922
I did nothing wrong!

16:04.006 --> 16:06.175
By Crom! The devil take your head!

16:06.258 --> 16:09.344
-Another wolf attack?
-Aye, my lord.

16:09.428 --> 16:13.140
A few more like him and we have
another rebellion on our hands.

16:13.223 --> 16:17.728
If we do not clear the trees,
the farmers cannot work the land,

16:17.811 --> 16:21.398
and the woodcutters cannot clear the trees
with these wolves.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.525
-This is not acceptable.
-Aye, my lord.

16:23.609 --> 16:26.778
We must show them
the wolves are no threat.

16:26.862 --> 16:29.281
They're just beasts. Finish them.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.365
Yes, my lord.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.538
And this is your girl, yes?

16:36.622 --> 16:39.208
It is, my lord. Robyn.

16:39.291 --> 16:43.504
There should be no child beyond the walls.
Why is she not in the scullery?

16:43.587 --> 16:45.422
My lord, she doesn't work there.

16:45.506 --> 16:48.884
You! See to it that the girl
reports to the scullery.

16:48.967 --> 16:49.968
Father.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.095
Do as the Lord Protector commands, lass.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.687
I ride out to deal
with the revolt in the south.

17:00.771 --> 17:04.733
When I return, I want all the wolves
gone from this forest.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.778
-Yes, my lord.
-Goodfellowe, you have two days.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.613
Don't waste them.

17:25.295 --> 17:26.922
Hey, girl.

17:27.005 --> 17:30.217
The one who took your bird,
I've seen her before.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.553
A while back with her mammy.

17:32.636 --> 17:36.807
Cross my heart,
she's one of them Wolfwalkers.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.433
Wolfwalkers?

17:38.517 --> 17:40.686
Yeah, Wolfwalkers.

17:40.769 --> 17:45.774
The ones that can talk to wolves, like.
But you know, they can heal as well.

17:45.858 --> 17:49.069
Her mother healed me with some wild magic.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.823
Maybe she'll fix your bird up.
Maybe she'll eat him.

17:52.906 --> 17:56.201
-I don't know.
-I need to get him back.

17:56.285 --> 17:59.788
I'd say once we're behind them walls,
neither of us is going anywhere.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.252
Can you keep a secret?

18:08.463 --> 18:09.798
My sheep.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.844
Lads, you didn't
lock that gate right at all.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.137
You let them sheep out, didn't you?

18:15.220 --> 18:18.974
Oh, yeah. Blame me for that too.
Everything is Seán Óg's fault!

18:19.057 --> 18:20.726
Get back in the cart, you.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.769
I feel like stretching my legs!

18:24.688 --> 18:26.857
-Help me with my sheep, you langers!
-I'll show them out!

18:26.940 --> 18:28.734
Oi! Get him!

18:29.568 --> 18:32.571
Hey, whatever your name is,
get back in that cart!

18:32.654 --> 18:33.906
Round up those sheep.

18:33.989 --> 18:35.949
Off of me! Have you no manners at all?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.202
Get back in there, you!

18:38.285 --> 18:39.870
An extra week in the stocks for that.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.747
-Where's the girl gone?
-Don't see her.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.123
Maybe in the woods.

18:43.207 --> 18:46.627
You two, look out for a girl.
She ran into the forest.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.963
Get her and bring her back to the castle.
Lord Protector's orders.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.548
-Yes, sir.
-Devil take--

18:53.091 --> 18:57.095
English soldiers. Who do they think
they are? Bossing us around.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.014
-What was that?
-Nothing!

18:59.097 --> 19:00.224
Get a move on!

19:00.307 --> 19:01.350
Yes, sir!

19:08.106 --> 19:11.151
Merlyn? Merlyn!

19:13.403 --> 19:15.489
Wolf, wolf
Kill the wolf

19:15.572 --> 19:18.325
Hunt them far and yonder

19:18.408 --> 19:20.702
Wolf, wolf
Kill the wolf

19:21.411 --> 19:24.039
Till all the wolves are done for

19:39.805 --> 19:41.014
Merlyn?

19:43.767 --> 19:44.810
Merlyn!

19:47.938 --> 19:49.022
Merlyn!

19:50.107 --> 19:53.527
Look at you. You're good as new,
aren't you? How's that?

19:54.278 --> 19:55.946
I'm so glad you're not hurt.

19:56.029 --> 19:59.491
How did they heal your wing?
It was that girl, wasn't it?

20:00.284 --> 20:03.704
What did she do?
Oh, I was afraid she was gonna eat you.

20:13.422 --> 20:16.091
Stay back, now! Back! I'll shoot!

20:16.175 --> 20:18.343
Merlyn. Merlyn, what are you doing?

20:19.052 --> 20:22.014
Get away, wolf! I swear, I'll--

20:22.681 --> 20:26.310
Merlyn, stop that! No! Wha--

20:26.393 --> 20:28.562
Stay away, wolf.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.689
No. Get away.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.776
No! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

20:39.781 --> 20:43.660
Get back! I'm gonna get you!
Get away, wolf!

21:32.751 --> 21:33.752
Merlyn?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.298
Merlyn! Wait!

21:38.382 --> 21:39.591
Merlyn!

21:56.149 --> 21:57.317
Merlyn!

22:02.281 --> 22:03.282
Merlyn!

22:41.820 --> 22:43.155
Whoa!

23:38.377 --> 23:39.378
Merlyn?

24:03.277 --> 24:04.319
What?

24:36.894 --> 24:42.107
You can come out now.
We can smell you. Yeah, you stink.

24:42.191 --> 24:44.693
I knew you were here.
Come out of your hidey-hole.

24:44.776 --> 24:46.278
Let's see you.

24:51.283 --> 24:52.868
Don't kill me.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.995
I do what I like. Come here.

24:55.078 --> 24:57.247
You're a--

24:57.331 --> 25:00.959
A Wolfwalker. So what?
You should thank me.

25:01.043 --> 25:02.961
-Why?
-I saved your life.

25:03.045 --> 25:04.796
Saved me? You bit me!

25:04.880 --> 25:06.882
Well, you kicked me
in the gob enough times.

25:06.965 --> 25:08.258
Well, you were attacking me.

25:08.342 --> 25:10.636
I was trying to get you out of that trap.

25:10.719 --> 25:13.263
And anyway, you came into my woods.

25:13.347 --> 25:15.182
Your woods? They're our woods.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.518
Your wolves are attacking the woodcutters
and the sheep.

25:17.601 --> 25:22.064
They should be staying closer to the town
and so should you, townie.

25:22.147 --> 25:23.565
Now give us a look at you.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.735
-Are you seeing things?
-Get off me!

25:26.818 --> 25:28.695
-How's your smell?
-Stop it!

25:28.779 --> 25:30.906
Smells like townie. Any extra fur?

25:30.989 --> 25:32.741
That's mine! Get away!

25:32.824 --> 25:36.662
Now, stop moving and let me fix it
before it's too late.

25:36.745 --> 25:37.955
Hey, get off me!

25:38.038 --> 25:40.499
Will you stop? Let me fix it!

25:41.959 --> 25:42.960
Fine.

25:57.850 --> 25:58.851
But what?

26:00.269 --> 26:03.272
Well, fixed now. Never happened.
Off you go.

26:03.355 --> 26:04.565
You did heal Merlyn.

26:04.648 --> 26:08.485
Yeah. I fixed you and your bird
and saved your life.

26:08.569 --> 26:10.612
You're welcome, townie. Bye!

26:10.696 --> 26:11.822
No, wait. Who's that?

26:11.905 --> 26:14.741
Is she your... your mother?

26:14.825 --> 26:16.994
You better go or the wolves will eat you.

26:17.411 --> 26:19.162
What? But I don't--

26:19.246 --> 26:21.415
Oh, no. Too late. They're gonna eat you!

26:21.498 --> 26:22.499
No!

26:29.590 --> 26:30.841
Whoa!

26:42.269 --> 26:45.898
Run away, townie girl!
The wolves are after you!

26:45.981 --> 26:47.733
Can't get away from us, townie!

26:48.317 --> 26:49.693
Get away from me!

26:49.776 --> 26:52.279
But you're so slow.

26:52.362 --> 26:56.241
Scared of your shadows, you are.
What would a townie know about wolves?

26:56.325 --> 26:58.368
Why do you have so much stuff?

26:58.452 --> 27:00.704
Hey, stop! That's my gear for hunting!

27:00.787 --> 27:03.415
Oh, a hunter. A little girl like you?

27:03.498 --> 27:05.125
Well, you're a girl too.

27:05.209 --> 27:07.377
I'm no girl! I'm a Wolfwalker!

27:08.545 --> 27:09.671
Whoa!

27:09.755 --> 27:11.089
Up you go!

27:12.299 --> 27:14.801
When I sleeps, I'm a wolf.

27:14.885 --> 27:19.389
When I'm awake, I'm me, Mebh!
Mebh Óg MacTire!

27:19.890 --> 27:21.183
What's your name, anyway?

27:21.642 --> 27:23.101
-Robyn.
-Robyn?

27:23.894 --> 27:27.731
I like birdies.
I climb so high to catch them.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.943
I'm too smart for them, though.
They can't get away from me for long.

27:40.869 --> 27:43.580
Caught again. Some hunter.

27:44.665 --> 27:47.042
That's two for me, none for you.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.752
Whoa!

27:49.503 --> 27:53.382
Stop being so annoying.
It's not funny, you know.

27:53.465 --> 27:54.842
Let me down!

27:54.925 --> 27:56.885
All right, townie.

27:56.969 --> 27:58.637
If you say so.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.805
No, wait!

28:04.726 --> 28:06.478
Stop calling me "townie."

28:06.562 --> 28:09.898
All right, Robyn.
Back home with you. Fun's over.

28:09.982 --> 28:13.151
Well, Mebh Ogamacatemera, your idea--

28:13.235 --> 28:15.195
-Do you hear that?
-What?

28:15.279 --> 28:17.531
A man. I'll get rid of him.

28:17.614 --> 28:20.242
A man? Oh, no. Father.

28:31.628 --> 28:34.298
Just one townie.
I'll give him a bit of a scare.

28:34.381 --> 28:35.716
No, stop.

29:17.299 --> 29:18.842
That was too close.

29:18.926 --> 29:23.096
What are you so scared of?
We have a pack of wolves with us.

29:27.059 --> 29:28.852
Hey, I told you.

29:28.936 --> 29:34.024
You can't go out in the daytime.
Mammy said so. Go back to bed.

29:34.566 --> 29:36.026
Is that your mummy back in the cave?

29:36.109 --> 29:38.779
Of course! Sure don't I look like her?

29:38.862 --> 29:42.616
And are any of the other wolves
people too?

29:42.699 --> 29:45.494
No. Jeepers! Are you mad?

29:45.577 --> 29:47.579
How big do you think my family is?

29:48.789 --> 29:51.667
I'm not supposed to be out here.
Listen, I've got to get back.

29:51.750 --> 29:54.795
Great, I'm mad to get rid of you.
Close your eyes.

29:54.878 --> 29:55.879
What? Why?

29:55.963 --> 29:58.799
Don't want you coming
back to my den. It's secret.

30:00.425 --> 30:01.593
But I already found it.

30:01.677 --> 30:03.387
Just shut up and walk.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.013
I'll point you back to the town.

30:05.097 --> 30:07.140
No, I need my crossbow back first.

30:07.224 --> 30:09.476
What do you need that for?
Shooting your bird again?

30:09.560 --> 30:11.019
No, shooting...

30:11.728 --> 30:13.230
Never mind.

30:13.313 --> 30:15.649
This way, hunter-townie-Robyn-girl.

30:20.946 --> 30:22.906
Hey! Stop pushing so fast.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.575
Will you stop complaining?

30:30.539 --> 30:31.540
Smell that?

30:32.040 --> 30:33.041
Mebh.

30:36.295 --> 30:38.005
Town tasties.

30:38.589 --> 30:40.048
"Town tasties"?

30:41.758 --> 30:44.052
What? Where's she gone now?

30:46.680 --> 30:48.182
What did you tell them?

30:48.265 --> 30:50.684
Just she's going home, isn't she?
'Tis obvious.

30:50.767 --> 30:54.271
Ned, say if that wolf bit her, like,
could she turn into one of them?

30:54.354 --> 30:55.189
A wolf?

30:55.272 --> 30:59.026
No. One of them half-wolf,
half-witch, half-people?

30:59.109 --> 31:01.862
Wolfwalkers? Will you stop?

31:01.945 --> 31:05.115
We are cutting down their woods, Ned.
Shouldn't be doing it.

31:05.199 --> 31:07.201
Save me from that nonsense.

31:07.284 --> 31:09.328
Seán Óg and the soldiers making us.

31:09.411 --> 31:13.749
But if old Lord Ironside
doesn't sort out those wolves,

31:13.832 --> 31:17.377
it won't just be us
who'll stop taking his orders.

31:17.461 --> 31:19.588
No more orders for me, Ned.

31:19.671 --> 31:21.798
Those town tasties are mine.

31:21.882 --> 31:24.718
I'm not after that.
I need my crossbow back.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.722
Oh. All right.
But those town tasties are mine.

31:28.805 --> 31:32.809
-No stuck-up lord in our city again.
-No, we won't, Ned.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.604
-What?
-What is it, Ned?

31:35.687 --> 31:36.813
The wind, maybe.

31:38.565 --> 31:40.651
Hey, what did you do with the spuds?

31:41.068 --> 31:44.196
The spuds, Ned? Hey, the bread's gone too.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.698
No spuds and no bread?

31:46.782 --> 31:49.868
-My hat. Give me my hat.
-My bread. Give me that.

31:50.577 --> 31:52.704
There's someone in there! What the...

31:52.788 --> 31:54.081
My milk!

31:54.164 --> 31:55.541
Something took my milk!

31:55.624 --> 31:57.251
Go! Go! Go!

32:03.465 --> 32:04.967
They nearly caught us.

32:07.803 --> 32:10.472
Nobody can catch me, townie.

32:13.183 --> 32:16.645
How can you stand living in there?
All the smells.

32:18.272 --> 32:19.857
It is pretty smelly.

32:20.899 --> 32:22.985
I don't like being stuck in there.

32:23.569 --> 32:25.112
I miss England.

32:25.195 --> 32:27.447
What's an "England"?

32:27.531 --> 32:28.782
I used to live there.

32:28.866 --> 32:31.952
I could go wherever I wanted,
play with my friends.

32:32.035 --> 32:33.328
It was really nice.

32:33.412 --> 32:35.247
Sounds like the forest.

32:35.330 --> 32:38.959
Merlyn and I even used to help Father
hunt for food.

32:39.042 --> 32:41.879
Now he wants me to stay in town
all the time.

32:41.962 --> 32:44.882
Stay here in the forest. It's great.

32:45.549 --> 32:47.759
-Loads of running.
-Playing.

32:47.843 --> 32:49.761
Eating, messing, climbing.

32:50.721 --> 32:51.722
Free.

32:54.224 --> 32:57.102
I can't. I can't leave my father.

32:57.561 --> 33:00.063
He has to work for the Lord Protector
and--

33:00.939 --> 33:04.276
Mebh, you can't stay in the forest either.
They're cutting it all down.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.528
No way! I'll scare them off.

33:06.612 --> 33:10.073
The Lord Protector wants the wolves gone.
Dead! You have to leave.

33:10.157 --> 33:13.827
We were leaving. Me, Mammy, with the pack.

33:13.911 --> 33:14.912
What stopped you?

33:15.537 --> 33:17.539
-Mammy went off.
-As a wolf?

33:17.623 --> 33:20.417
Yeah, to find us a new place to live.

33:20.501 --> 33:26.381
I'm sure it's some huge den
with no stinkers around and loads of food.

33:26.465 --> 33:29.968
It's going to be amazing!

33:30.052 --> 33:33.472
So then, where is she?
Do you think she got caught?

33:33.555 --> 33:37.059
No. She's fine. Nobody can catch my mammy.

33:37.142 --> 33:41.939
And anyway, if she was caught by those
stinkers, I'd get my wolves to eat them!

33:42.022 --> 33:44.650
So, you're waiting for her to come back?

33:45.234 --> 33:46.276
Yep.

33:46.985 --> 33:52.032
It's just her and me in the whole world.

33:53.909 --> 33:55.202
Like me and Father.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.460
But what if they find the den?

34:03.544 --> 34:05.921
No, they won't. Nobody has.

34:06.004 --> 34:07.005
Well, I did.

34:07.089 --> 34:09.550
Yeah. Only 'cause I let you.

34:26.525 --> 34:28.110
I have to tell my father about you.

34:28.193 --> 34:31.196
He didn't know--
We didn't know that Wolfwalkers are real.

34:34.324 --> 34:37.870
That you were people. I better get back.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.375
Look, I'm gonna help you.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.127
Wait for me at the big tree tomorrow.

34:45.210 --> 34:49.172
I'll bring you some bread--
I mean, some "town tasties."

34:49.255 --> 34:52.134
All right so. Smell you later, townie.

34:52.217 --> 34:53.969
Not if I smell you first.

35:21.121 --> 35:22.998
'Tis yourself.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.835
So, they didn't eat you? That's great.

35:26.919 --> 35:29.421
You were right. That girl healed Merlyn.

35:29.505 --> 35:32.299
Didn't she, now? I told you.

35:32.382 --> 35:33.383
I better get back.

35:33.467 --> 35:37.137
So, you'll know where to find me anyways
if you're looking for me.

35:39.473 --> 35:40.474
Father?

35:41.767 --> 35:42.768
Father?

35:43.477 --> 35:45.062
I've got to convince him.

35:45.771 --> 35:48.273
We need to tidy this place up
before he gets back.

35:57.324 --> 35:59.743
"My, Robyn, this place is sparkling."

36:00.619 --> 36:03.038
Thank you, Father.
Take a seat. Put up your feet.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.249
"Don't mind if I do, lass."

36:05.332 --> 36:06.500
Hard day hunting?

36:06.583 --> 36:09.044
"Aye. Not a sniff of wolf out there."

36:09.837 --> 36:13.131
Well, what if I told you
I can get all the wolves to leave

36:13.215 --> 36:14.883
and we don't even have to kill them?

36:15.384 --> 36:17.427
"I'd say you're telling tall tales again."

36:17.511 --> 36:20.430
Oh, but I'm not.
Now, promise me you won't get angry.

36:20.514 --> 36:21.682
"I promise."

36:21.765 --> 36:25.269
You see, I met a girl in the forest
who has magic healing powers.

36:25.352 --> 36:26.562
She healed Merlyn.

36:27.729 --> 36:29.273
And she's a Wolfwalker.

36:29.857 --> 36:31.108
"A Wolfwalker?"

36:31.525 --> 36:34.903
It's true. When she sleeps,
she turns into a wolf.

36:34.987 --> 36:36.363
She can talk to the wolves.

36:36.446 --> 36:38.448
Her and her mother were
going to take the wolves away,

36:38.532 --> 36:41.535
-but her mother went missing.
-"Missing? Poor thing."

36:41.618 --> 36:44.121
I know, but if we can
help her find her mother,

36:44.204 --> 36:45.956
then they can
all leave the forest together,

36:46.039 --> 36:48.458
and you will have done your duty
to the Lord Protector.

36:48.542 --> 36:51.170
"Oh, brilliant, lass.
Absolutely brilliant.

36:51.253 --> 36:52.963
Thank you. Our problems are solved.

36:53.046 --> 36:55.132
We can go back to how things used to be."

37:00.220 --> 37:02.181
My girl, come here to me.

37:02.764 --> 37:06.351
Are you all right? How are you
after that wolf attack? A bit shaken?

37:06.435 --> 37:08.437
No, I'm fine.
Take a seat. Put up your feet.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.273
That's nice.

37:11.940 --> 37:15.277
And how was your scullery work?
You must be tired, love.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.529
Well, about that.
What if I told you I could--

37:17.613 --> 37:21.158
And Merlyn is back.
My, you've had quite the day, lass.

37:21.241 --> 37:23.285
Yes, I have. But what if I told you--

37:23.368 --> 37:24.703
My day has been awful.

37:24.786 --> 37:27.664
Every trap I set this week
has either been broken or sprung.

37:27.748 --> 37:29.208
Never seen the like of these wolves.

37:29.291 --> 37:32.711
Father, what if I told you
I can get all the wolves to leave

37:32.794 --> 37:34.630
and you don't even have to kill them?

37:34.713 --> 37:36.924
Now, promise you won't get angry with me.

37:37.007 --> 37:38.008
Go on.

37:38.467 --> 37:39.510
You didn't promise.

37:39.593 --> 37:41.303
I know. Go on. Tell me.

37:41.845 --> 37:45.557
-You see, I went back to find Merlyn--
-You were out in the woods?

37:45.641 --> 37:47.267
Father, listen. She's one of them.

37:47.351 --> 37:49.853
A Wolfwalker,
like the woodcutter said. They're real!

37:49.937 --> 37:51.438
-You went back?
-But, Father--

37:51.522 --> 37:52.523
You left the scullery?

37:52.606 --> 37:54.900
Well, I didn't actually
get to the scullery.

37:54.983 --> 37:57.194
What? The Lord Protector ordered--

37:57.277 --> 37:58.820
-If we can just find her mother and--
-Listen!

37:58.904 --> 38:01.448
You have to follow
the Lord Protector's rules.

38:01.532 --> 38:03.867
He gave you a direct order
and you disobeyed him.

38:03.951 --> 38:05.619
Have you no fear of the stocks?

38:06.453 --> 38:09.122
We need to work together
to stay in this town, lass.

38:09.206 --> 38:11.083
I'll bring you to the scullery
tomorrow myself.

38:11.166 --> 38:13.377
But please,
I thought you would understand.

38:14.044 --> 38:15.546
I can help you. If we just--

38:15.629 --> 38:20.217
Help me by doing your work
and staying in town, away from danger.

38:20.801 --> 38:21.927
Now, promise me.

38:23.387 --> 38:24.429
I promise, Father.

38:24.972 --> 38:26.557
All right. Now, go to your bed.

38:31.270 --> 38:32.938
Mother would have listened to me.

38:34.481 --> 38:36.525
She would have wanted you safe, Robyn.

38:37.818 --> 38:38.819
Sleep well.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.910
We'll find a way to help her, Merlyn.

39:27.618 --> 39:29.828
-Robyn?
-Father?

39:29.912 --> 39:32.748
-You all right?
-It's nothing.

39:32.831 --> 39:34.208
Just a bad dream.

39:34.291 --> 39:38.712
Well, should make an early start of it,
both of us. Let's go.

39:59.650 --> 40:02.277
Nice to have a new girl joining us.

40:02.361 --> 40:03.695
-Keep an eye on her.
-Aye.

40:03.779 --> 40:05.447
-She's to work the full day.
-Aye, aye.

40:05.531 --> 40:07.783
-Work is prayer, Robyn.
-'Tis all right, child.

40:07.866 --> 40:10.744
Sure wasn't I only half your age
when I started here.

40:10.827 --> 40:13.288
Just do what you're told now,
and you'll be grand.

40:14.164 --> 40:15.874
It's for your own good, lass.

40:48.991 --> 40:51.076
Work is prayer, girl.

40:51.159 --> 40:52.870
Better if you don't stop.

41:19.563 --> 41:20.772
Oh, no.

41:45.130 --> 41:46.507
Girl.

41:48.550 --> 41:51.678
Girl.

41:55.849 --> 41:59.269
Girl.

42:07.819 --> 42:08.820
Girl.

42:11.198 --> 42:12.491
Girl.

42:12.574 --> 42:13.575
Girl!

42:13.659 --> 42:16.411
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.
Get yourself out of this room, girl.

42:16.495 --> 42:19.456
The Lord Protector has forbidden
anyone from entering.

42:19.998 --> 42:22.793
You're lucky 'tis me that found you,
child, not His Lordship.

42:22.876 --> 42:24.545
Put you in the stocks, he would.

42:24.628 --> 42:29.132
The Lord Protector expects his rules
to be followed. Remember that tomorrow.

42:29.675 --> 42:31.385
Now, off home with you.

42:49.194 --> 42:51.780
Oh, now. There you are.

42:55.242 --> 42:56.660
Did you see your new friend again?

42:56.743 --> 42:57.744
Robyn!

42:57.828 --> 42:59.955
Come in.
You'll catch your death out there.

43:04.084 --> 43:07.129
Are you a hunter or a housemaid?

43:12.718 --> 43:13.927
Work is prayer, Robyn.

43:14.011 --> 43:16.221
Then I prayed the whole Bible.

43:16.889 --> 43:17.890
Good lass.

43:20.392 --> 43:21.810
This is still new for you,

43:21.894 --> 43:24.104
but it's a righteous life
for a young lady.

43:24.188 --> 43:25.814
Well, it's no life for me.

43:25.898 --> 43:28.358
I can get the Wolfwalkers to leave.
You just need to listen to me--

43:28.442 --> 43:30.485
Robyn Goodfellowe, enough of your stories.

43:30.569 --> 43:31.570
I can go look for her--

43:31.653 --> 43:34.072
You must do as you're told.
No more fairy tales.

43:34.156 --> 43:35.157
-But the--
-No buts.

43:35.240 --> 43:37.451
-The Wolfwalkers--
-Wolfwalkers are not real.

43:50.172 --> 43:52.549
They are real. Right, Merlyn?

44:28.168 --> 44:30.462
Merlyn, can you smell that?

44:31.463 --> 44:33.090
Merlyn, what's happened to you?

44:34.049 --> 44:35.551
I can see your scent.

44:38.136 --> 44:42.641
What? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

44:45.894 --> 44:50.315
What? What do I do? How did this happen?
Oh, no, no, no.

44:54.194 --> 44:56.321
-Wolf! Wolf! Robyn, wake up!
-Father, help!

45:00.617 --> 45:02.911
No, no, no, Father. It's me! Father!

45:18.760 --> 45:19.761
What was that?

45:20.637 --> 45:21.972
Did you see that?

45:41.783 --> 45:42.993
Mebh!

46:02.721 --> 46:03.847
-Mebh!
-Robyn!

46:05.057 --> 46:06.225
Something's happened to me.

46:06.308 --> 46:08.018
Yeah, I can see that.

46:09.311 --> 46:13.023
I thought I'd fixed the bite.
I thought you'd be fine.

46:13.106 --> 46:15.234
Mammy's gonna kill me.

46:15.317 --> 46:17.277
Well, my father will kill me.

46:18.820 --> 46:21.615
Hey! Calm down and give her room!

46:22.115 --> 46:24.034
Anyway, sin é. That's it.

46:24.117 --> 46:28.455
Now, I see you like this. It's flipping
great! I thought we were the last ones.

46:28.539 --> 46:30.374
It's great? I'm a Wolfwalker!

46:30.457 --> 46:32.292
I know! Mammy said this would be bad,

46:32.376 --> 46:34.837
like, never to bite anyone, but I love it!

46:34.920 --> 46:36.046
Is maith sin!

46:36.129 --> 46:39.466
It is bad. I'll get killed like this.
What about my body?

46:39.550 --> 46:42.177
It's asleep. Nice and cozy.

46:42.261 --> 46:46.807
Look, you're a wolf when you sleep,
a girl when you're awake. No big deal!

46:46.890 --> 46:49.768
But the soldiers, and my father...

46:49.852 --> 46:54.106
Don't worry about that.
Learn how to be a wolf first. Come on.

46:54.982 --> 46:59.820
Why do you want to be a human?
Being a wolf is way better. I'll show you.

47:01.822 --> 47:02.823
Can you smell me?

47:03.407 --> 47:05.367
Of course. Everybody can.

47:05.951 --> 47:07.786
Well, close your eyes.

47:10.038 --> 47:12.624
You don't need your eyes to see.

47:13.208 --> 47:17.004
And you can hear
every little thing that moves.

47:19.339 --> 47:22.092
And your paws can hear through the earth.

47:22.176 --> 47:24.219
But don't you know

47:24.303 --> 47:27.181
We're stronger now

47:27.264 --> 47:29.808
My heart still beats

47:30.475 --> 47:32.477
And you have four legs now,

47:32.561 --> 47:35.522
so you can run really fast
and jump so high!

47:35.606 --> 47:37.399
And my mind still fears

47:37.482 --> 47:38.984
Hey, wait for me!

47:39.067 --> 47:40.527
But we're running out of time

47:40.611 --> 47:43.197
Keep your nose down! Be a wolf!

47:44.907 --> 47:47.868
All the echoes in my mind cry

47:49.328 --> 47:52.206
There's blood on your lies

47:52.289 --> 47:55.292
And the scars open wide

47:55.375 --> 47:58.378
There is nowhere for you to hide

47:58.462 --> 48:00.464
The hunter's moon is shining

48:00.547 --> 48:03.383
I'm running with the wolves tonight

48:03.467 --> 48:06.261
I'm running with the wolves

48:06.345 --> 48:08.889
I'm running with the wolves tonight

48:08.972 --> 48:12.100
I'm running with the wolves

48:12.184 --> 48:13.310
I'm running with the

48:15.020 --> 48:16.146
Are you letting them out?

48:16.230 --> 48:19.316
The forest is ours at night.
Wait till you see.

48:20.025 --> 48:21.860
My spirit talks

48:23.070 --> 48:25.864
I'm everything

48:25.948 --> 48:28.659
But we're running out of time
Time

48:31.787 --> 48:34.665
All the echoes in my mind cry

48:36.250 --> 48:39.086
There's blood on your lies

48:39.169 --> 48:42.130
And the scars open wide

48:42.214 --> 48:44.842
There is nowhere for you to hide

48:44.925 --> 48:47.302
The hunter's moon is shining

48:47.386 --> 48:50.305
I'm running with the wolves tonight

48:50.389 --> 48:53.100
I'm running with the wolves

48:53.183 --> 48:56.144
I'm running with the wolves tonight

48:56.228 --> 48:58.856
I'm running with the wolves

48:58.939 --> 49:00.858
I'm running with the

49:10.659 --> 49:13.579
I'm running with the

49:13.662 --> 49:16.790
I'm running with the wolves

49:16.874 --> 49:19.710
I'm running with the

49:19.793 --> 49:22.337
I'm running with the

49:22.421 --> 49:25.048
I'm running with the

49:25.132 --> 49:28.468
I'm running with the wolves

49:28.552 --> 49:31.221
I'm running with the wolves tonight

49:31.305 --> 49:34.016
I'm running with the wolves

49:34.099 --> 49:37.102
I'm running with the wolves tonight

49:37.186 --> 49:39.980
I'm running with the wolves

49:40.063 --> 49:41.440
I'm running with the

49:46.069 --> 49:49.448
Well, townie, this is as far as we go.

49:49.531 --> 49:51.575
The woods are getting smaller every day.

49:51.658 --> 49:57.331
I know. I try and scare them off...
but they just don't get it.

49:59.958 --> 50:00.959
How about that?

50:03.462 --> 50:05.214
A lot of smelly people there.

50:05.297 --> 50:06.798
Hey, I'm in there.

50:06.882 --> 50:09.510
Fast asleep, snoring away.

50:16.850 --> 50:19.728
I better go back. I'm scared, Mebh.

50:20.103 --> 50:22.481
Yeah. The town's no place for a wolf.

50:22.564 --> 50:25.317
I know. If they don't shoot me,
they'll cage me.

50:27.528 --> 50:29.488
Mebh, your mother.
Do you think that they might've--

50:29.571 --> 50:32.741
No! Nobody can catch my mammy.

50:33.909 --> 50:36.453
Sorry. How long has she been gone?

50:36.537 --> 50:37.538
Since...

50:38.956 --> 50:43.085
She's all right. She'll be back soon.
She promised.

50:44.127 --> 50:47.881
Well, don't worry. Wherever she is,
we'll find her. I can help you.

50:47.965 --> 50:49.716
Yeah! There's two of us now.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.552
I'll sneak out
and meet you back here tomorrow.

50:51.635 --> 50:54.388
I'll be waiting for you, again!

50:54.471 --> 50:57.850
Mebh, we'll find her.
Then you can all leave and be safe.

50:58.392 --> 51:00.060
You promise?

51:00.143 --> 51:01.144
I promise.

52:30.734 --> 52:32.736
Hey, wolf! Get it!

52:33.779 --> 52:35.531
Wolf, there! Shoot!

52:39.284 --> 52:40.452
Wolf! Wolf in the town!

52:40.536 --> 52:42.037
-Wolf!
-Wolf in the town!

52:42.120 --> 52:43.455
Oh, my God!

52:48.335 --> 52:50.295
Lord Protector won't be happy!

52:55.300 --> 52:57.010
-Open it now!
-The wolf!

52:58.303 --> 52:59.346
Wolf.

53:01.223 --> 53:02.391
Get it, now!

53:02.474 --> 53:04.393
-Yes, sir!
-Load your muskets! Surround the beast!

53:05.269 --> 53:06.770
-Kill the wolf!
-Kill the wolf!

53:06.854 --> 53:08.438
Kill it! Kill the beast!

53:09.356 --> 53:10.315
Fire!

53:12.943 --> 53:14.444
Get rid of that wolf!

53:15.654 --> 53:17.865
Goodfellowe, what is this?

53:20.075 --> 53:25.247
Enough! I will deal with this wolf myself.
Now, back to your beds.

53:32.671 --> 53:34.590
-Do you see it?
-Where'd it go?

53:34.673 --> 53:36.383
Keep looking. It's here somewhere.

53:52.316 --> 53:53.817
That scent.

53:53.901 --> 53:55.903
-I knew it!
-Wolf in the castle!

53:55.986 --> 53:57.154
Do you see it?

53:57.237 --> 53:59.239
Search every corner.

53:59.615 --> 54:01.325
Don't let it get away!

54:03.160 --> 54:04.369
Girl.

54:06.914 --> 54:07.915
Girl.

54:08.999 --> 54:10.459
Girl, here. Quick.

54:24.932 --> 54:26.266
Hello?

54:27.226 --> 54:30.729
Only a Wolfwalker can make another.
When did it happen to you? Where?

54:30.812 --> 54:33.232
Is the wolf that bit you near?
Is she all right?

54:33.315 --> 54:35.442
Is she alive? Where is Mebh?

54:37.778 --> 54:40.864
You're Mebh's mother.
Wait till I tell her I found you.

54:40.948 --> 54:43.534
She'll be so happy.
She's waiting for you in the forest.

54:43.617 --> 54:45.869
You mean she's still here? In the woods?

54:45.953 --> 54:48.330
No, no, no! She must go!

54:48.413 --> 54:50.707
But we have to rescue you.
How do I get you out?

54:51.500 --> 54:53.377
Wolf! Wolf in the castle!

54:53.460 --> 54:55.254
You'll be killed like this.

54:55.337 --> 54:57.339
Listen, girl, get back
to your human body right away.

54:57.422 --> 54:58.632
If I can just get the--

54:58.715 --> 55:00.801
She should never have bitten you.

55:00.884 --> 55:04.096
Get Mebh and leave.
It's not safe for our kind here.

55:04.179 --> 55:06.974
-But Mebh won't leave without you.
-She must not come for me.

55:07.057 --> 55:10.227
She must not wait for me.
She must run. And you too, girl.

55:10.310 --> 55:11.311
Now!

55:34.751 --> 55:37.254
Lord, what must I do?

55:37.337 --> 55:40.382
I left to quell rebellion
and returned to more.

55:40.966 --> 55:44.136
This wild land must be civilized.

55:44.219 --> 55:46.388
That is Your will.

55:52.769 --> 55:53.770
So, wolf,

55:53.854 --> 55:56.940
tomorrow I will show them
I have tamed you,

55:57.024 --> 55:59.651
just as I will tame this land.

56:00.444 --> 56:05.115
They will have nothing to fear
if they trust in the Lord's will.

56:06.241 --> 56:07.451
-What the--
-Go!

56:09.411 --> 56:11.997
Tell Mebh to lead the pack to safety.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.540
Go! Now!

56:49.868 --> 56:51.119
How do I do this?

56:51.745 --> 56:53.580
Come on, come on.

56:58.043 --> 56:59.211
Come on.

57:02.631 --> 57:04.007
Robyn, are you awake?

57:04.091 --> 57:06.510
-What, Father?
-There was a wolf here in our chambers.

57:06.593 --> 57:08.929
Got in while you were sleeping.
It could have taken you.

57:09.012 --> 57:10.013
Father, I was--

57:10.097 --> 57:12.599
This world is such a dangerous
place for you, lass.

57:13.350 --> 57:15.811
-I promised I would keep you safe.
-But that--

57:18.939 --> 57:21.441
-Come with us.
-Lord Protector wants a word with you.

57:21.525 --> 57:23.277
Back, I say!

57:23.360 --> 57:26.321
Ironsides! What are you doing about it?

57:28.866 --> 57:32.327
Goodfellowe.
A wolf here, threatening the town.

57:32.411 --> 57:35.706
It got inside the castle
in my very chambers.

57:35.789 --> 57:37.624
-This is intolerable.
-Sir, I--

57:37.708 --> 57:40.294
Enough! You have failed.
You are no hunter.

57:40.377 --> 57:43.630
From now on, you will serve in my ranks
as a foot soldier.

57:46.592 --> 57:50.637
-Townspeople! Order, please! Order! Order!
-Silence.

57:51.138 --> 57:53.140
Tomorrow, I will show you all.

57:53.223 --> 57:57.811
I will tame this land.
I will find that den.

57:57.895 --> 58:00.731
Every last wolf will be destroyed.

58:00.814 --> 58:02.441
No! Stop!

58:02.524 --> 58:03.609
There is another way!

58:03.692 --> 58:05.944
Release her, the Wolfwalker.

58:07.112 --> 58:08.197
Wha--

58:08.280 --> 58:10.782
Please! You must listen!

58:11.575 --> 58:12.743
Take her to the stocks.

58:12.826 --> 58:14.203
-No! Sir, please!
-Stop that!

58:14.286 --> 58:16.538
She's just a child.
And I know these woods.

58:16.622 --> 58:18.790
-I can still help you on your mission.
-Silence!

58:21.418 --> 58:24.213
It's safe now! Go to your beds!

58:24.296 --> 58:27.716
Tomorrow, I will make good on my word.

58:27.799 --> 58:29.092
Guards! Guards!

58:29.176 --> 58:32.471
-Move it! Move along, now!
-Get out of here!

58:32.554 --> 58:36.225
Goodfellowe,
I will give you both one more chance.

58:36.308 --> 58:38.727
Follow your orders
or you'll be off to war.

58:38.810 --> 58:39.811
Yes, my lord.

58:39.895 --> 58:41.438
And, girl, come here.

58:42.940 --> 58:45.943
Never speak of such pagan nonsense
in this town.

58:46.026 --> 58:50.572
Follow the rules or you will never see
your father again. Do you understand?

58:51.114 --> 58:52.533
Yes, my lord.

58:53.367 --> 58:55.452
Double the guard. Bar the gate.

58:55.536 --> 58:58.413
No more wolves inside these walls.

58:58.497 --> 59:00.207
Yes, sir. On the double!

59:06.255 --> 59:10.467
Listen to me. We must follow our orders
if we are to stay together.

59:10.884 --> 59:13.554
You must do as you're told, my girl.

1:00:27.002 --> 1:00:31.089
Made a new friend, Mammy.
A townie, but a nice one.

1:00:31.632 --> 1:00:32.883
Her name is Robyn.

1:00:32.966 --> 1:00:35.761
She's taller than me, but I'm stronger.

1:00:35.844 --> 1:00:38.889
And she brushed my hair
and gave me this flower.

1:00:38.972 --> 1:00:41.350
And she's from a place called England.

1:00:41.433 --> 1:00:43.685
And we're gonna meet
by the oak tree tomorrow.

1:00:44.186 --> 1:00:46.021
And she promised to help.

1:00:46.104 --> 1:00:49.233
And-- Where are you?

1:00:50.317 --> 1:00:54.613
You promised you'd come back,
but it's been so long now.

1:00:55.155 --> 1:00:58.075
Are you lost?
Has something happened to you?

1:00:59.243 --> 1:01:02.955
Robyn will help me find you, Mammy.
She promised.

1:01:03.622 --> 1:01:05.165
There's two of us now.

1:01:07.876 --> 1:01:12.089
Seoithín seothó

1:01:12.172 --> 1:01:16.093
Seoithín seothó

1:01:24.059 --> 1:01:25.853
Robyn, time for work.

1:01:40.117 --> 1:01:42.452
Merlyn, I can't get out to Mebh.

1:01:42.536 --> 1:01:44.913
Find her. Tell her to leave.

1:01:44.997 --> 1:01:47.416
Lead her away. She must go.

1:01:48.917 --> 1:01:50.669
At least you can be free.

1:02:03.015 --> 1:02:04.558
It's for your own good, lass.

1:02:51.605 --> 1:02:53.649
Birdie! About time.

1:02:53.732 --> 1:02:55.567
Robyn, what you took you so long?

1:02:58.403 --> 1:03:01.198
Robyn! Where are you?

1:03:03.575 --> 1:03:05.953
What do you mean
she can't come out of the town?

1:03:09.206 --> 1:03:13.085
I'm not leaving. She promised.
Help me find her, Merlyn.

1:03:46.994 --> 1:03:48.495
Where were you?

1:03:49.746 --> 1:03:51.248
Mebh, what are you doing here?

1:03:51.331 --> 1:03:53.792
I waited for ages!

1:03:53.876 --> 1:03:55.335
You're supposed to be gone from here.

1:03:55.419 --> 1:03:56.753
I sent Merlyn to tell you.

1:03:56.837 --> 1:03:59.256
What's that, girl? Who are you talking to?

1:03:59.339 --> 1:04:00.924
Nobody.

1:04:01.675 --> 1:04:04.678
I've forgotten about them knots.
They're supposed to be done.

1:04:04.761 --> 1:04:07.181
You must go, Mebh.
Lead the pack away to safety.

1:04:07.264 --> 1:04:10.559
I told you. I'm not leaving
without my mammy.

1:04:14.313 --> 1:04:16.398
Mebh, you have to listen to me.

1:04:16.481 --> 1:04:19.026
You must leave the forest.
Take the wolves and go.

1:04:19.610 --> 1:04:21.737
But... you said you'd help me.

1:04:21.820 --> 1:04:25.282
-I am helping you, the only way I can.
-You promised.

1:04:25.365 --> 1:04:29.036
The Lord Protector will burn the woods.
He will kill all the wolves by sunset.

1:04:29.119 --> 1:04:31.705
You have to get them out.
Do you understand?

1:04:34.208 --> 1:04:35.292
Now go.

1:04:37.336 --> 1:04:40.923
You said you would help me. You promised.

1:04:42.508 --> 1:04:46.720
Go, Mebh. Take Merlyn with you. Goodbye.

1:05:16.041 --> 1:05:17.668
I hear he's got a wolf.

1:05:17.751 --> 1:05:21.463
I hear it's a giant beast to behold.
Much bigger than a wolf.

1:05:21.547 --> 1:05:24.550
-Mammy?
-Won't that be a sight.

1:05:25.676 --> 1:05:28.679
Do you suppose he's going to kill it?

1:05:28.762 --> 1:05:31.515
Oh, yes. 'Tis a monster.

1:05:31.598 --> 1:05:33.684
-Mammy!
-Crazy child!

1:05:33.767 --> 1:05:35.143
-Careful, girl!
-Watch out!

1:05:35.227 --> 1:05:37.437
You'll hurt someone like that.

1:05:39.773 --> 1:05:43.235
Come on now, ladies.
Everyone's to go to the courtyard.

1:05:46.488 --> 1:05:50.659
The Lord Protector wants
everyone outside, girl. Come on.

1:05:53.704 --> 1:05:57.124
They brought out that big cage.
'Tis up on a stage.

1:05:58.125 --> 1:05:59.543
Oh, no.

1:06:08.969 --> 1:06:12.222
Listen to me! I'm the best soldier!

1:06:12.306 --> 1:06:16.310
Push! Push! A little further.

1:06:17.978 --> 1:06:20.647
Good. That's enough. Step away.

1:06:20.731 --> 1:06:22.357
Return to your positions.

1:06:23.650 --> 1:06:27.112
-Mebh, stop! Please.
-My mammy's here! Get off of me!

1:06:27.196 --> 1:06:28.780
Mebh. No!

1:06:30.449 --> 1:06:35.412
People of Kilkenny,
I have heard your concerns.

1:06:35.495 --> 1:06:41.460
Wolf attacks, livestock lost,
a wolf running through our very streets.

1:06:41.543 --> 1:06:44.505
-But listen to me. Have no fear.
-Mebh, stop.

1:06:45.756 --> 1:06:47.007
Get off of me!

1:06:47.090 --> 1:06:48.800
You must get out of here now.

1:06:48.884 --> 1:06:51.970
Let me go. Let me go.

1:06:52.054 --> 1:06:55.724
Hey! Hey! Over here! I've caught a wolf.

1:06:55.807 --> 1:06:59.478
-...a civilized country.
-Look! She caught the wolf.

1:06:59.561 --> 1:07:00.812
We cannot be...

1:07:00.896 --> 1:07:04.024
My fellow hunters,
we have a new wolf to kill.

1:07:04.983 --> 1:07:07.110
No. No! Get off of me!

1:07:09.613 --> 1:07:13.075
I have to find my mammy. Get away from me.

1:07:13.158 --> 1:07:16.328
Robyn, stop. What are you doing?

1:07:17.704 --> 1:07:20.832
I'm gonna eat you all! Let me out!

1:07:20.916 --> 1:07:23.418
Mebh, your mother told me
to keep you safe.

1:07:23.502 --> 1:07:26.046
You liar! You knew!

1:07:27.714 --> 1:07:30.300
This is for your own good. I'm sorry.

1:07:30.384 --> 1:07:32.052
Get the wolf, wolf...

1:07:32.135 --> 1:07:36.181
I have been sent here by the Lord himself

1:07:36.265 --> 1:07:38.934
to conquer the wild.

1:07:39.017 --> 1:07:44.064
And I will show you it can be tamed.
Behold.

1:07:51.071 --> 1:07:52.155
-Wolf!
-Mammy!

1:07:54.032 --> 1:07:55.784
-Kill the wolf!
-Kill the wolf!

1:07:57.536 --> 1:07:58.871
Kill the wolf!

1:07:58.954 --> 1:08:00.080
Kill the beast!

1:08:04.293 --> 1:08:06.170
He has got a wolf.

1:08:06.253 --> 1:08:10.591
Enough! That's enough! Calm! Calm!

1:08:11.550 --> 1:08:14.678
You have nothing to fear from this beast.

1:08:14.761 --> 1:08:17.346
Now, open the gate.

1:08:36.450 --> 1:08:39.036
-Kill that wolf.
-Come on now.

1:08:41.496 --> 1:08:46.667
You see? This once wild creature
is now tamed.

1:08:46.752 --> 1:08:50.339
Obedient. A mere faithful servant.

1:08:52.508 --> 1:08:56.886
I will rid our land
of all its wretched kind.

1:08:56.970 --> 1:08:59.765
Mammy. Mammy! Mammy!

1:09:02.559 --> 1:09:04.060
Mebh, no!

1:09:10.484 --> 1:09:13.319
-Hey!
-Mammy, Mammy. It's me. I'm here.

1:09:13.403 --> 1:09:15.197
-What's this? What's going on here?
-I'm here, Mammy.

1:09:15.279 --> 1:09:18.200
Let her go! That's my mammy!

1:09:19.785 --> 1:09:21.036
Let her go!

1:09:21.662 --> 1:09:24.288
Goodfellowe, take charge
of this wild thing.

1:09:35.341 --> 1:09:38.136
Goodfellowe, can you not catch anything?
What are you doing?

1:09:41.723 --> 1:09:43.642
Collar that demon
and put her in the stock.

1:09:43.725 --> 1:09:46.019
Father! No!

1:09:52.859 --> 1:09:53.861
-Guards!
-Stop!

1:09:53.944 --> 1:09:54.945
Don't move.

1:09:55.571 --> 1:09:57.030
Hold it right there, you wildling.

1:10:00.325 --> 1:10:02.494
Father! Don't! No!

1:10:02.578 --> 1:10:03.829
Robyn! Stay back!

1:10:05.539 --> 1:10:07.916
Father, stop! This is wrong!

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:09.501
Robyn! Get away from here!

1:10:10.169 --> 1:10:11.461
Whoa!

1:10:15.549 --> 1:10:17.009
-A soldier's been bitten!
-Father!

1:10:17.092 --> 1:10:18.051
The wolf bit him!

1:10:19.928 --> 1:10:21.930
Pull it back. Pull it back.

1:10:22.014 --> 1:10:23.390
-Whoa!
-That's it.

1:10:23.473 --> 1:10:25.142
-Whoa!
-Lock it up!

1:10:25.225 --> 1:10:27.811
-Oh, no, you don't!
-Cover it, now!

1:10:28.645 --> 1:10:29.646
Mammy!

1:10:32.232 --> 1:10:35.277
Mammy. What have they done?

1:10:54.213 --> 1:10:55.464
Come here, you!

1:11:00.177 --> 1:11:02.513
I am a Wolfwalker!

1:11:03.805 --> 1:11:07.559
I'm getting my wolves
and coming back for my mammy!

1:11:07.643 --> 1:11:10.145
Then we'll eat you all!

1:11:22.449 --> 1:11:26.119
People! Listen to me. Listen to me.

1:11:26.203 --> 1:11:30.832
Do not fear wild girls and wolves

1:11:30.916 --> 1:11:34.169
because tonight we put an end to this.

1:11:34.253 --> 1:11:38.090
I will burn this forest to the ground.

1:11:38.173 --> 1:11:41.510
I will lead cannons
to the den of these beasts

1:11:41.593 --> 1:11:44.930
-and send them all to hell.
-No!

1:11:45.013 --> 1:11:48.851
We shall prevail. It is the Lord's will.

1:11:49.393 --> 1:11:51.144
-Prepare a squadron.
-Yes, sir.

1:11:51.228 --> 1:11:52.813
-Move along.
-Get a move on.

1:11:52.896 --> 1:11:54.356
Move along.

1:11:54.439 --> 1:11:58.402
Goodfellowe, what have you become?
You can't even catch a little girl?

1:11:58.944 --> 1:12:01.530
Prove yourself a worthy soldier tonight

1:12:01.613 --> 1:12:03.699
or tomorrow you are in chains.

1:12:03.782 --> 1:12:06.577
Now, put an end to that wild beast.

1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:09.246
What cannot be tamed must be destroyed.

1:12:09.329 --> 1:12:11.623
No, please. You can't.

1:12:11.707 --> 1:12:13.041
Robyn! Stop this.

1:12:13.125 --> 1:12:18.797
And for heaven's sake, put manners on
that girl, or manners will be put on her.

1:12:34.396 --> 1:12:38.734
-Over here. Come on.
-Steady, steady. Move along.

1:12:38.817 --> 1:12:41.820
-Come on, lads. Let's go...
-Off home, you lot.

1:12:41.904 --> 1:12:43.780
Off the castle grounds.

1:12:44.364 --> 1:12:46.283
No, please. Father, please don't.

1:12:46.366 --> 1:12:48.410
Enough. Robyn, return to your duties.

1:12:48.493 --> 1:12:50.579
-But you can't.
-Now, girl!

1:13:08.388 --> 1:13:12.309
Hurry! With that weapon,
our victory is at hand.

1:13:25.697 --> 1:13:27.407
Robyn, what are you doing, girl?

1:13:27.491 --> 1:13:29.993
The Lord Protector will have us in chains.

1:13:30.077 --> 1:13:33.622
He's wrong, Father. All this is wrong.
Don't you see that?

1:13:33.705 --> 1:13:36.416
Robyn, step aside.
We must do what we're told.

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:38.168
Why, Father? Why?

1:13:38.252 --> 1:13:39.378
I'm afraid.

1:13:40.963 --> 1:13:42.172
I'm afraid.

1:13:42.256 --> 1:13:43.257
Father?

1:13:44.758 --> 1:13:47.135
I won't be here to protect you forever.

1:13:47.219 --> 1:13:50.681
I'm so afraid that one day
you will end up in a cage.

1:13:52.558 --> 1:13:54.393
But I already am in a cage.

1:13:55.519 --> 1:13:57.145
Wolves! Wolves!

1:14:00.065 --> 1:14:01.775
Wolves! Wolves!

1:14:10.284 --> 1:14:11.618
What is happening?

1:14:17.249 --> 1:14:18.750
I'm sorry, Father.

1:14:21.295 --> 1:14:22.546
Robyn!

1:14:22.629 --> 1:14:24.381
-The beast is loose!
-What the...

1:14:25.090 --> 1:14:26.049
No!

1:14:28.343 --> 1:14:29.344
Grab her!

1:14:30.512 --> 1:14:31.805
Cover the gate!

1:14:33.515 --> 1:14:35.851
-Lower the gate!
-Incoming!

1:14:35.934 --> 1:14:36.977
Fire!

1:14:37.060 --> 1:14:38.478
-No!
-Don't let it get away!

1:14:41.148 --> 1:14:43.275
I tried to stop her, but I failed.

1:14:43.358 --> 1:14:44.943
She's gonna get herself killed.

1:14:47.070 --> 1:14:48.655
It's coming this way!

1:14:51.783 --> 1:14:53.619
Go on, then!

1:14:55.162 --> 1:14:56.788
Shut the gates!

1:14:57.581 --> 1:14:59.124
Draw the bridge up!

1:15:03.337 --> 1:15:04.671
Ready your arms!

1:15:04.755 --> 1:15:06.048
Go.

1:15:06.131 --> 1:15:07.341
Fire!

1:15:07.424 --> 1:15:08.967
Aim for the beast!

1:15:12.930 --> 1:15:14.848
-Wolf!
-Watch out!

1:15:33.492 --> 1:15:36.411
It's time for us to attack those townies!

1:15:36.495 --> 1:15:38.038
Let's eat them all!

1:15:38.121 --> 1:15:39.706
They have my--

1:15:44.419 --> 1:15:45.420
Mammy?

1:15:51.301 --> 1:15:52.427
Mammy.

1:15:57.683 --> 1:16:00.936
Mammy! Mammy.

1:16:06.942 --> 1:16:08.193
Mammy, you're back.

1:16:08.277 --> 1:16:09.278
Mebh.

1:16:13.949 --> 1:16:18.495
I thought I would never see you again...
until this one freed me.

1:16:25.127 --> 1:16:27.754
Mebh, I'm so sorry.

1:16:27.838 --> 1:16:32.676
I was only trying to keep you safe.
Trying to help. I didn't know what to do.

1:16:32.759 --> 1:16:33.760
I was...

1:16:35.179 --> 1:16:36.471
I'm sorry, Mebh.

1:16:43.770 --> 1:16:45.647
Come here to me, townie.

1:16:52.487 --> 1:16:54.656
I'm not a townie anymore, Mebh.

1:16:54.740 --> 1:16:56.116
Thanks for helping Mammy.

1:17:02.289 --> 1:17:03.290
No!

1:17:03.373 --> 1:17:07.961
Mammy! No, no!
Mammy, what happened to you? No!

1:17:08.045 --> 1:17:11.089
Mammy! Mammy! No!

1:17:11.173 --> 1:17:12.424
Robyn!

1:17:12.508 --> 1:17:14.218
-Mammy!
-Robyn! Run! Quick!

1:17:14.301 --> 1:17:15.928
Mammy, what happened to you?

1:17:16.011 --> 1:17:17.012
No, Father!

1:17:17.095 --> 1:17:19.097
-Come on, Robyn!
-No, Father!

1:17:19.181 --> 1:17:21.642
-You shot her! How could you?
-Come on! Robyn! Run!

1:17:21.725 --> 1:17:23.227
Let me go! Mebh!

1:17:23.310 --> 1:17:26.021
-I have to help her! Let me go!
-Back!

1:17:26.104 --> 1:17:27.689
-I said back! Stay back!
-No!

1:17:27.773 --> 1:17:29.483
-What have you done?
-Get back!

1:17:29.566 --> 1:17:30.776
Get away from here!

1:18:27.749 --> 1:18:30.043
Stop! No! Let me go!

1:18:30.127 --> 1:18:31.712
-Robyn! No! Stay!
-Stop!

1:18:31.795 --> 1:18:33.380
Mebh!

1:18:33.463 --> 1:18:34.965
No!

1:18:35.048 --> 1:18:37.384
I have to help her! She's dying!

1:18:37.467 --> 1:18:38.468
Come on, Robyn!

1:18:39.219 --> 1:18:40.512
Let me go!

1:18:40.929 --> 1:18:42.681
Mebh! Mebh!

1:18:42.764 --> 1:18:45.225
No, Robyn! Why? I don't understand!

1:18:45.309 --> 1:18:50.022
Don't you see?
I'm one of them. I'm a Wolfwalker.

1:18:50.939 --> 1:18:56.069
No, Robyn. Please.
Stay with me. I can't let you go.

1:18:56.570 --> 1:18:57.571
Father.

1:19:09.917 --> 1:19:10.918
Robyn.

1:19:14.963 --> 1:19:16.089
Robyn!

1:19:27.559 --> 1:19:29.311
-Forward!
-Ready arms.

1:19:29.895 --> 1:19:31.021
Formation!

1:19:31.688 --> 1:19:35.734
Goodfellowe, have you lost your senses?
What is going on here?

1:19:35.817 --> 1:19:38.070
Robyn, she's gone.

1:19:38.862 --> 1:19:41.740
-Chain him. We'll deal with him later.
-Yes, sir.

1:19:44.076 --> 1:19:45.953
That's a fresh track.

1:19:46.411 --> 1:19:48.789
Move on! Burn it all!

1:19:48.872 --> 1:19:50.374
Yes, sir. Forward.

1:19:50.457 --> 1:19:51.917
-Hold still.
-Forward.

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.795
-Burn the woods!
-Burn it down!

1:20:41.466 --> 1:20:43.719
Oh, God, what have I done?

1:20:43.802 --> 1:20:48.223
Robyn... Robyn, wake up, please. Please.

1:21:02.404 --> 1:21:03.405
Mammy!

1:21:05.532 --> 1:21:07.659
Please, Mammy, breathe.

1:21:09.411 --> 1:21:15.125
I've never healed anything this
bad before. It's gonna take time.

1:21:16.043 --> 1:21:17.628
I'm not leaving you, Mammy.

1:21:35.020 --> 1:21:36.063
I'll hold them off.

1:21:38.232 --> 1:21:39.233
Follow her.

1:21:44.655 --> 1:21:46.198
-Watch it, boys!
-Ready arms!

1:21:46.281 --> 1:21:47.908
Get ready to march!

1:21:53.497 --> 1:21:55.415
They're in there! Advance!

1:21:55.499 --> 1:21:57.584
Aye, sir! Forward, men!

1:22:00.045 --> 1:22:03.590
Continue onward. Push, men! Push!

1:22:07.427 --> 1:22:09.680
We can drive them back. We are wolves!

1:22:09.763 --> 1:22:12.599
-Formation!
-They have guns. A cannon.

1:22:13.851 --> 1:22:17.437
But don't be afraid.
They're in our forest. Let's go!

1:22:20.023 --> 1:22:21.608
-Brave on!
-Push, men, push!

1:22:21.692 --> 1:22:22.734
Keep going!

1:22:23.694 --> 1:22:25.529
Load your weapons.

1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:29.074
-Burn them out. Pick them off!
-Yes, sir!

1:22:29.449 --> 1:22:30.784
-Spread out!
-More fire!

1:22:30.868 --> 1:22:32.828
-Over here!
-Burn it!

1:22:33.662 --> 1:22:35.414
-Burn the woods!
-Onward!

1:22:39.668 --> 1:22:42.588
-Hey, more fire over here!
-Burn it down!

1:22:46.133 --> 1:22:47.759
What on Earth is this?

1:23:01.648 --> 1:23:02.649
Spread out!

1:23:02.733 --> 1:23:04.568
Get more fire going over here!

1:23:05.235 --> 1:23:06.820
Take cover in the trees.

1:23:08.155 --> 1:23:09.698
Use the traps.

1:23:10.407 --> 1:23:11.408
Oh, bloody hell!

1:23:11.491 --> 1:23:12.618
Draw their fire.

1:23:14.119 --> 1:23:16.496
Then strike from the shadows
when they're reloading.

1:23:17.998 --> 1:23:20.584
Report? Report?

1:23:32.846 --> 1:23:33.847
No!

1:23:35.098 --> 1:23:37.351
I can't, Mammy. I can't.

1:23:37.434 --> 1:23:39.019
I'm not strong enough.

1:23:39.102 --> 1:23:42.356
Please, tell me what to do.

1:23:51.740 --> 1:23:53.867
The pack. I need the pack.

1:23:58.038 --> 1:23:59.289
What? What is that?

1:24:03.752 --> 1:24:04.753
Run!

1:24:23.355 --> 1:24:24.940
Dear God. What was that?

1:24:26.733 --> 1:24:28.277
It's a Wolfwalker.

1:24:31.446 --> 1:24:32.865
Witchcraft.

1:24:32.948 --> 1:24:36.493
-Run! Get out of here!
-What do you think you're doing?

1:24:36.577 --> 1:24:38.036
Reform your ranks!

1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:39.621
Get back to your positions!

1:24:39.705 --> 1:24:41.290
-We're surrounded.
-Run!

1:24:47.921 --> 1:24:49.548
Have mercy! Have mercy!

1:24:53.051 --> 1:24:56.388
Fire! Fire at will!

1:24:56.471 --> 1:24:57.723
Fire!

1:24:59.391 --> 1:25:00.601
They're everywhere!

1:25:14.114 --> 1:25:15.115
Robyn.

1:25:20.829 --> 1:25:21.997
Robyn, go!

1:25:27.169 --> 1:25:29.838
Gunners, don't let them get away!

1:25:30.547 --> 1:25:33.175
Slay the foul beasts!

1:25:43.227 --> 1:25:47.439
Quick! Everyone, down here.
I need your help.

1:25:53.612 --> 1:25:54.613
Robyn?

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:56.365
Where's Robyn?

1:26:05.457 --> 1:26:09.002
Men, run and you will be killed!

1:26:09.086 --> 1:26:12.172
Follow my command and we will prevail.

1:26:13.507 --> 1:26:15.425
The Lord is guiding us.

1:26:18.470 --> 1:26:19.638
Robyn.

1:26:20.597 --> 1:26:22.057
Forward!

1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:24.059
-Load the cannon!
-Aye, sir.

1:26:47.791 --> 1:26:51.712
Show yourselves, you wicked creatures.

1:26:51.795 --> 1:26:54.214
Come, meet your end.

1:27:02.306 --> 1:27:05.434
There it is, the devil's lair!

1:27:05.517 --> 1:27:07.728
Our victory is at hand!

1:27:07.811 --> 1:27:09.479
Gunners, fire!

1:27:12.024 --> 1:27:13.483
Take cover!

1:27:15.527 --> 1:27:16.403
Robyn!

1:27:18.405 --> 1:27:19.990
Musketeers...

1:27:21.158 --> 1:27:22.242
fire!

1:27:25.829 --> 1:27:27.247
Get back here!

1:27:29.374 --> 1:27:30.209
No, Robyn!

1:27:40.010 --> 1:27:41.011
Robyn?

1:27:41.094 --> 1:27:42.471
Robyn?

1:27:46.141 --> 1:27:47.726
Robyn, get up.

1:27:57.319 --> 1:27:58.403
Get up! Run!

1:27:58.487 --> 1:28:00.405
Enough, Goodfellowe.

1:28:08.205 --> 1:28:09.456
Foul bird!

1:28:12.876 --> 1:28:14.962
Stop! She's just a girl.

1:28:15.045 --> 1:28:19.842
By God's glory and punishment,
he vanquishes thee.

1:28:20.425 --> 1:28:22.886
Robyn! No!

1:28:39.236 --> 1:28:41.613
Lord God Almighty, protect me.

1:29:41.131 --> 1:29:42.132
Goodfellowe.

1:30:37.271 --> 1:30:39.398
Into your arms, my Lord...

1:30:42.234 --> 1:30:44.444
I commend my soul.

1:31:03.130 --> 1:31:04.381
Father?

1:31:11.096 --> 1:31:12.222
Father.

1:31:17.853 --> 1:31:19.354
We have to help Mebh.

1:31:38.415 --> 1:31:41.210
Please, Mammy, don't go. Don't go.

1:31:41.752 --> 1:31:43.420
Don't leave me again.

1:31:43.504 --> 1:31:44.796
Please.

1:31:45.547 --> 1:31:46.548
Mebh.

1:31:48.300 --> 1:31:49.343
Robyn.

1:31:50.719 --> 1:31:53.263
I tried. I really tried,

1:31:53.347 --> 1:31:55.474
but I'm just not strong enough.

1:31:58.352 --> 1:31:59.978
I need her.

1:32:00.521 --> 1:32:03.023
I can help like I promised.

1:32:03.106 --> 1:32:05.734
Mebh, there's two of us now.

1:32:08.987 --> 1:32:10.781
There's two of us now.

1:32:11.615 --> 1:32:14.409
Show me what to do, Mebh.
I don't know how.

1:32:14.493 --> 1:32:17.079
I'll show you. Follow me.

1:32:53.615 --> 1:32:55.742
-What is that?
-Sorcery.

1:33:12.718 --> 1:33:13.760
Jeepers.

1:33:15.053 --> 1:33:18.807
Do you hear that?
'Tis lovely music altogether.

1:34:09.566 --> 1:34:12.194
-Mebh.
-Mammy.

1:34:12.277 --> 1:34:15.489
Mebh, my little wolf.

1:34:15.572 --> 1:34:16.740
Mammy, you're back.

1:34:19.910 --> 1:34:23.080
I thought you were gone again.
I've missed you.

1:34:25.999 --> 1:34:28.335
Thank you, mo chara.

1:34:28.919 --> 1:34:30.170
My friend.

1:34:46.311 --> 1:34:47.312
Father.

1:34:48.981 --> 1:34:50.315
Don't go.

1:34:54.194 --> 1:34:56.071
Stay, please.

1:34:56.154 --> 1:34:57.823
You're one of us.

1:35:04.913 --> 1:35:07.749
Father, you're in our pack now.

1:35:41.658 --> 1:35:43.076
All is well, my love.

1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:44.703
All is well, Father.

1:35:53.420 --> 1:35:54.963
Come on!

1:35:57.382 --> 1:35:59.134
Race you!

1:36:00.719 --> 1:36:02.638
Wolf, wolf

1:36:02.721 --> 1:36:04.556
Howls the wolf

1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:08.227
Wolf, wolf, run free

1:36:08.310 --> 1:36:10.103
Wolf, wolf

1:36:10.187 --> 1:36:12.231
Howls the wolf

1:36:12.314 --> 1:36:14.816
Run free

1:36:15.484 --> 1:36:18.362
Run free

1:36:19.863 --> 1:36:23.075
Run free

1:36:23.534 --> 1:36:25.118
Wolf, wolf

1:36:25.202 --> 1:36:27.246
Howls the wolf

1:36:27.329 --> 1:36:30.666
Wolf, wolf, run free

1:36:31.124 --> 1:36:32.876
Wolf, wolf

1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:34.586
Howls the wolf

1:36:34.670 --> 1:36:37.506
Run free

1:36:38.173 --> 1:36:41.844
