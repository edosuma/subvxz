12:23.034 --> 12:25.495
Swallow. Then praise.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.288
Ah! [groans]

12:27.372 --> 12:31.042
Every season, it's Amber, Amber, Amber!

12:31.125 --> 12:33.211
[all] Amber! Amber! Amber!

12:33.294 --> 12:37.048
Uh, hi, honey.
Your meat looks good too.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.050
Now that's a carcass.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.301
[groans]

12:40.385 --> 12:43.846
Don't worry. We just gotta take our meat
to the next meat level.

12:43.930 --> 12:49.477
- Like, we can add bugs for flavor.
- And a dash of dirt for texture.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.604
[Thunk chuckles]

12:51.688 --> 12:54.482
Now a pinch of grass for color.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.442
[shrieks, thuds]

12:56.526 --> 12:57.860
Oh, it's ruined!

12:57.944 --> 12:59.904
No one will eat this.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.448
Serve me instead.

13:03.741 --> 13:07.120
- Maybe no one will notice?
- Hey! What's that I'm noticing?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.204
Oh, uh...

13:09.247 --> 13:11.207
It's a new type of meat, sir.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.255
This just in, yum!

13:17.338 --> 13:19.215
I always believed in you, honey.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.010
Oh, my mouth is so happy.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.512
Hey! No leave!

13:24.595 --> 13:28.141
Amber crave more approval!

13:28.224 --> 13:29.600
- The last slice!
- The last slice!

13:29.684 --> 13:32.020
- It's mine!
- It's mine.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.690
- [shouts]
- Wow.

13:35.773 --> 13:39.986
You guys really like meatzza.
How about we make more tomorrow?

13:40.069 --> 13:43.072
- This is why I love you.
- My mouth will be there!

13:44.991 --> 13:47.160
[all chatter]

13:48.077 --> 13:50.079
How are those meatzzas looking, Thunk?

13:57.503 --> 14:00.298
There. Fresh from the ground
to your mouth.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.217
That's the Ugga and Son guarantee.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.844
[gulping]

14:04.927 --> 14:07.305
How do you get it to taste so good?

14:07.388 --> 14:10.892
I care for each meatzza
as if it were my own child.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.018
And let me tell you,

14:12.101 --> 14:15.271
there's no better feeling
than seeing people eat your children,

14:15.354 --> 14:17.315
except spending time with my mom.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.275
Oh, that's sweet.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.070
Now how about a little less lip-flap
and little more flip-flat?

14:22.153 --> 14:25.865
Amber must say,
people really like Ugga meatzzas.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.328
That why Amber decide
make even better meatzzas.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.954
[claps]

14:34.457 --> 14:36.042
Even better meatzzas.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.128
Why, that sounds even better.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.090
Spit out Ugga garbage meatzza
and follow Amber.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.926
- [all spitting]
- [gasps] My babies!

14:45.009 --> 14:46.260
[growls]

14:46.344 --> 14:49.055
What do you think you're doing?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.140
Amber in meatzza business now.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.227
Also in business of beating Ugga
at own game.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.895
And business good.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.109
One slice, plea...

15:02.026 --> 15:06.572
I mean, shame on you,
copying my family like that.

15:06.656 --> 15:10.118
Save me a slice.
[chuckles nervously]

15:10.201 --> 15:14.497
This was our thing, Amber.
You can't steal our thing!

15:14.580 --> 15:16.833
Sure Amber can.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.921
If Ugga not want trade something,
Amber must ask Ugga to move along.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.093
[grumbles] Lousy superior meatzza.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.761
But we can do even better.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.306
- We will crush them.
- Yeah!

15:32.390 --> 15:33.909
Do we really need to crush them though?

15:33.933 --> 15:38.855
No, we don't "need" to crush them,
but we will crush them!

15:40.565 --> 15:43.151
Our top story: clouds.

15:43.234 --> 15:47.530
Fluffy friends or sky monsters trying
to drown us with rain?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.158
But first, these messages.

15:50.241 --> 15:54.620
At Ugga and Son, we know you have
a choice of meatzzas.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.666
That's why we've come up
with meatzza delivery.

15:58.749 --> 15:59.749
[all gasp]

15:59.792 --> 16:04.297
From our stand to your mouth
in 30 moments or less.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.132
[grunting]

16:08.551 --> 16:10.720
[all cheer]

16:10.803 --> 16:12.263
[growls]

16:12.889 --> 16:17.018
Amber and Amber Daughter
now have delivery, too.

16:17.101 --> 16:20.646
Yeah. And our meatzzas come
with a free set of wings.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.276
[all cheer]

16:26.235 --> 16:27.528
[growls]

16:28.070 --> 16:31.657
Hey, old people, try our new
old-friendly veggie meatzza.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.410
[all gulping]

16:34.494 --> 16:36.078
[growls]

16:36.162 --> 16:40.374
Here are Amber new meatzza
for ultimate meat-likers!

16:43.336 --> 16:47.465
Old Man Root?
I thought you didn't even eat meat.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.301
Oh, come on. A man has his limits.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.555
Hey, wanna eat so much meatzza
that your stomach hurts?

16:54.639 --> 16:56.098
Mm-hm. That's why I'm alive.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.519
Try our new large meatzza! It's large!

16:59.602 --> 17:01.687
[all] Ooh! Ahh!

17:03.689 --> 17:08.944
Like, check our new meatzza,
the extra large.

17:10.320 --> 17:14.742
- This feels even better than it looks.
- Ooh, me next.

17:15.535 --> 17:19.454
I mean, how dare you rip off my son
and beautiful wife?

17:19.539 --> 17:21.165
Oh, give it up, Grug.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.420
It's all right, Mom.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.839
At least we're getting to spend time
with each other.

17:28.923 --> 17:31.551
And with our new meatzza friend.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.345
Oh, you can eat my face.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.681
Don't mind if I do.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.182
Ah! [shrieks]

17:38.266 --> 17:39.642
I'm in pain!

17:40.351 --> 17:42.562
Hey, you two make meatzzas, right?

17:42.645 --> 17:44.730
- I need 50.
- Really?

17:44.814 --> 17:46.899
Yeah. And I need them fast.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.318
[growls]
By the end of the day.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.445
Fifty by the end of the day?

17:51.529 --> 17:53.364
- That's...
- No problem at all.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.325
- [growls]
- Oh, don't you start, too.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.036
Take that, Amber.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.914
No one's ever done an order
this big before.

18:01.998 --> 18:06.377
Well, I guess if we're working together,
it'll be fun, right?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.635
[groans] This isn't fun.

18:14.719 --> 18:18.264
What will be fun is seeing the look
on Amber's face

18:18.347 --> 18:21.851
when Ugga and Son put her outta business.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.733
Good enough. We'll call it a special.
How's it going over there?

18:29.734 --> 18:33.404
I need energy.
Maybe if I eat something.

18:33.487 --> 18:37.283
Thunk, no eating the product.
Do you wanna crush Amber or not?

18:38.451 --> 18:41.412
To be honest, I didn't start
making meatzzas to crush anyone,

18:41.495 --> 18:44.206
except the buffalippos' carcasses
we're using, of course.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.876
Thunk, if you're not
gonna take this seriously,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.879
I will have to find someone else who will.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.799
Are you getting rid of me
as your partner and your son?

18:53.883 --> 18:57.053
Of course not. Just as a partner.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.932
Well, I could tell when I'm not wanted,

19:02.016 --> 19:04.185
by the fact that you said exactly that!

19:04.268 --> 19:06.354
[sobs]

19:10.608 --> 19:11.692
Here you go, Squawk.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.820
I can make 'em faster too,
thanks to my new partner.

19:14.904 --> 19:18.199
Happy to pound my body
on the ground for a good cause.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.867
Too slow.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.662
Our meatzza needs have already been met.

19:22.745 --> 19:26.123
Amber? [grunts]

19:26.207 --> 19:31.045
- But how did you...?
- Amber new partner tip Amber off.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.297
- Thunk?
- Hello, Mother.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.383
You look well.
Covered in meat works for you.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.510
You're with them now?

19:37.593 --> 19:41.389
Yes. Thunk like son Amber never have.

19:41.472 --> 19:44.225
Or want before today.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.476
[sighs]

19:51.399 --> 19:53.484
There must be some way to beat 'em.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.237
We could turn them into meatzzas.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.489
Too dark?

20:02.284 --> 20:03.828
This seems weird.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.706
Why would Old Man Root ask us
to bring every meatzza we have

20:06.789 --> 20:07.873
to the top of the mountain?

20:07.957 --> 20:12.962
Who care? Customer always right,
even when customer annoying weirdo.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.547
[Ugga laughs]

20:14.630 --> 20:16.674
That should take 'em a while.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.428
Leaving the meatzza market all ours!

20:20.511 --> 20:23.514
Yay for Ugga and new son!

20:23.597 --> 20:25.683
Or maybe we change it to Wompy's Place.

20:25.766 --> 20:26.766
[explosion]

20:28.894 --> 20:31.147
[Thunk screams]

20:33.858 --> 20:36.610
[all scream]

20:37.236 --> 20:40.448
[gasps] No, no.
No, no, no, no. They're trapped.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.616
Oh, my poor little Thunkster!

20:42.700 --> 20:43.951
What have I done?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.995
Let your desire to win
consume you so much

20:46.078 --> 20:47.997
that you put your son's life in danger?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.207
Yeah, I know. It was kind of implied.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.751
[screams] I gotta save him!

20:51.834 --> 20:53.169
[pants]

20:53.252 --> 20:54.378
[all groaning]

20:54.462 --> 20:56.964
Amber staring death in face.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.924
Amber have one thought.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.554
- Amber wish Amber hunt more.
- [sighs]

21:03.637 --> 21:07.057
- Thunk.
- Mom, how did you know we were here?

21:07.141 --> 21:08.934
A mother always knows.

21:09.894 --> 21:13.898
Also, Old Man Root didn't send you here,
I did. To get you out of my way.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.066
- What?
- Not cool, old lady.

21:16.150 --> 21:19.403
Amber mad. But respect Ugga game.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.113
I know how you can escape.

21:21.197 --> 21:25.201
Throw your meatzzas into the lava
and use them as stepping stones.

21:25.284 --> 21:29.497
How do we know this isn't another one
of your mom tricks to crush us?

21:29.580 --> 21:32.333
No. I am leaving the meatzza game.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.877
It turned me against my own son.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.463
Being Mom and Thunk
is more important to me

21:37.546 --> 21:39.465
than being Ugga and Son.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.633
Please.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.604
[grunting]

21:55.064 --> 21:56.064
[Pat] Like, ow!

21:57.149 --> 22:02.112
Aw, that's sweet, Ugga choose son
over thriving meatzza stand.

22:02.196 --> 22:05.991
That also very good
for Amber meatzza stand.

22:06.075 --> 22:10.704
Pat, get ready work harder
than ever before!

22:10.788 --> 22:12.206
Like, ugh.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.541
Wanna trade moms?

22:14.917 --> 22:16.710
[groans]

22:19.255 --> 22:21.465
[both sniffing, sizzling]

22:23.717 --> 22:24.844
[sniffs] Huh.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.137
Those smell good. I wonder how they taste.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.183
[both spitting]

22:32.518 --> 22:34.311
Oh, hot food.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.522
- No, thanks.
- Yeah.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.941
Plus the edge is, like, all crusty.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.279
