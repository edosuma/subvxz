permanent marker?

09:46.540 --> 09:49.419
- It's dry erase.
- That was smart of you.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.249
Yeah, and I pruned up
my fingers in the fountain.

09:52.250 --> 09:56.379
Oh, dang it! Now I gotta come up
with a different old lady getup.

09:56.380 --> 09:58.749
Till, sweetie, you gotta
take it down a notch.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.919
Hey, remember that embarrassing
tattoo I was telling you about?

10:01.920 --> 10:05.249
- Uh-huh.
- Look, here.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.619
[Tilly] Hey, I thought you
said it was embarrassing.

10:07.620 --> 10:10.249
It says it right there.
This pig is radical.

10:10.250 --> 10:13.829
Thanks, sweetie. But I got him
for all the wrong reasons.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.879
I was trying to prove to other
people that I was grown up.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.619
- Did it work?
- I don't know.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.289
Doing stuff like this
for other people's
benefit stinks.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.959
Later I learned that what
I thought of myself

10:23.960 --> 10:26.209
mattered more than what other
people thought of me.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.999
Huh. I see.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.829
That's when I got this guy.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.669
Self respect pig!

10:31.670 --> 10:34.669
Anyways, you're the most
mature girl I've ever known.

10:34.670 --> 10:37.749
So who cares if some people
are too dumb to see it?

10:37.750 --> 10:40.419
- Thank you, Mama.
- So you ready to go home?

10:40.420 --> 10:42.749
I'm sure your dad
has some zucchini left.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.829
Um, can we actually make one
more stop on the way out?

10:45.830 --> 10:48.289
- [clicking]
- [Tilly] Ow. Ow.

10:48.290 --> 10:51.249
Thanks again!
So, Tilly, how do you feel?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.579
Well, I feel... pretty great.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.249
Thanks, Mama.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.619
You're gonna
keep them covered up?

10:56.620 --> 10:59.419
Yep, I got 'em for me,
not for others.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.209
Now, we just gotta
wait for Saxon.

11:01.210 --> 11:02.539
[clicking]

11:02.540 --> 11:04.330
[Tilly] Good lookin' studs, bud.
