00:06.440 --> 00:08.376
male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.409 --> 00:12.046
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.415
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.448 --> 00:16.417
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.450 --> 00:17.685
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.718 --> 00:19.820
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.723
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.292
- GREAT SHOW, ANDREAS.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.360
YOU'VE REALLY OUTDONE YOURSELF
THIS TIME.

00:26.394 --> 00:29.197
EVERY PIECE IS BRILLIANT!
- NOT BRILLIANT ENOUGH.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.232
THE N.E.A.
JUST CANCELLED MY GRANT.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.234
THREE PEOPLE IN MISSOURI
COMPLAINED.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.437
- ANDREAS!
ANDREAS, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.839
- HERE COMES
YOUR NEW FUNDING.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.841
- HI, MY DARLING.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.177
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING?

00:43.211 --> 00:45.646
YOUR PAINTINGS
ARE ABSOLUTELY GENIUS,

00:45.679 --> 00:47.548
ESPECIALLY THE ONE
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.351
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THESE ARE MY ONLY PAINTINGS.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.321
- NO.
NO, NO, NO.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.855
THIS ONE.
THIS IS IT.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.659
THIS SYMBOLIZES
THE DEATH OF LIGHT, OF HOPE,

00:58.692 --> 00:59.660
OF WHITE PRIVILEGE.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.763
THE RED PAINT--
IT'S A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY

01:02.796 --> 01:05.233
WARNING SOCIETY TO WAKE UP.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.435
- THAT'S NOT PAINT.

01:10.838 --> 01:14.708
- BLOOD'S
FROM ELLEN SAZELIN, 43.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.245
BUSINESS CARD SAYS SHE'S CFO
OF LUSCIOUS GRAPE DISTRIBUTORS.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.779
- NEVER HEARD OF IT.

01:18.812 --> 01:22.683
- THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU DON'T BUY
$5,000 BOTTLES OF WINE.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.851
NEITHER DO I,

01:23.884 --> 01:25.786
BUT I'VE SEEN THEIR ADS
IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.788
- DEAD HOW LONG?

01:27.821 --> 01:28.656
- BODY TEMP PUTS T.O.D.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.325
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
6:00 AND 9:00 P.M.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.794
SHE EXSANGUINATED
FROM A SEVERED CAROTID.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.797
- ANY EVIDENCE OF A BREAK-IN?

01:36.830 --> 01:39.300
- LOCKS ON THE WINDOWS
AND DOORS WEREN'T TAMPERED WITH,

01:39.333 --> 01:42.536
BUT WE'RE DUSTING FOR PRINTS.
- MM-HMM.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.838
USED A PIECE OF GLASS
FROM THE BROKEN VASE, HUH?

01:44.872 --> 01:47.841
- SHE DEFINITELY STRUGGLED.
PANTIES ARE TORN TOO.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.444
- HE RAPE HER?
- SIGNS OF ANAL TRAUMA--

01:50.478 --> 01:52.780
NO DNA.
- NEIGHBORS HEAR ANYTHING?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.748
- TOO MUCH NOISE FROM
THE GALLERY OPENING DOWNSTAIRS.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.750
AND GET THIS--
THE SHOW IS CALLED

01:56.784 --> 01:59.353
DOLLARS AND DEATH:
THE POLITICS OF BLOOD.

01:59.387 --> 02:02.890
- SO SHE BRINGS HOME A DATE,

02:02.923 --> 02:04.892
OPENS SOMETHING
FROM THE COMPANY CELLAR,

02:04.925 --> 02:07.861
AND HE ATTACKS HER.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.863
- SO MUCH FOR ROMANCE.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.850
- WE CHECKED
ELLEN'S BROWSING HISTORY.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.219
LUSCIOUS GRAPE HOME PAGE
WAS THE LAST SITE SHE VISITED

03:05.253 --> 03:06.354
BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.988
- SHE WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.790
WHO'S THAT WOMAN IN THE VIDEO?

03:09.823 --> 03:12.660
- HI.
I'M ANNETTE COLE,

03:12.693 --> 03:15.996
PRESIDENT AND CEO
OF LUSCIOUS GRAPE,

03:16.029 --> 03:19.967
NEW YORK'S PREMIER
WINE AND SPIRITS IMPORTER.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.970
WE'RE HERE TO SATISFY
ALL YOUR IMBIBING DESIRES.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.373
AND THIS IS ELLEN SAZELIN,

03:25.406 --> 03:27.975
THE CFO OF LUSCIOUS GRAPE.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.745
- ANNETTE AND I FOUNDED OUR
LITTLE BUSINESS 15 YEARS AGO.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.248
WE PLANTED A TINY SEED
AND HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE

03:34.282 --> 03:35.182
OF WATCHING IT BLOSSOM
AND MATURE

03:35.215 --> 03:37.017
INTO THIS MARVELOUS VINEYARD
OF SUCCESS.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.953
- I WONDER IF ELLEN'S KILLER
RESENTED WHAT SHE HAD.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.256
- MAYBE A JEALOUS COWORKER.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.791
- COME MEET BRUCE CLARKSON,

03:43.824 --> 03:46.260
THE HEAD OF OUR
ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.329
- ANNETTE AND ELLEN
ARE NOT ONLY COWORKERS.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.331
THEY'RE MOTHERS TO US ALL.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.767
- AND THIS IS CORRINE STAFFORD,
OUR NEWEST LG MEMBER.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.603
- I'M THE BABY
OF THE LG FAMILY,

03:55.636 --> 03:57.771
BUT THE SECOND I ARRIVED,

03:57.805 --> 04:00.741
EVERYBODY MADE ME FEEL
RIGHT AT HOME.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.311
HEY, JUSTIN!
- JUSTIN JENNINGS--

04:03.344 --> 04:04.545
OUR STAR SALESMAN.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.980
- WE'RE A SMALL,
TIGHTLY KNIT GROUP HERE AT LG,

04:07.014 --> 04:10.050
AND ANNETTE AND ELLEN
MAKE US ALL FEEL...

04:10.083 --> 04:12.052
REAL SPECIAL.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.755
- AND THIS IS DAVID WATSON,
OUR WINE BUYER.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.425
WE'D BE LOST WITHOUT HIM...
AND HIS NOSE.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.727
- BEAUTIFUL.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.030
HERE'S TO ANOTHER
FANTASTIC YEAR AT LG.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.799
both:
COME BE A PART OF OUR FAMILY.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.469
SHARE OUR LOVE
OF LUSCIOUS GRAPE.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.837
[glasses clink]

04:29.870 --> 04:30.871
CHEERS!

04:30.904 --> 04:32.340
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.675
- CHEERS.
- LUSCIOUS GRAPE...

04:34.708 --> 04:36.043
- I WONDER
IF ELLEN'S NEIGHBORS

04:36.076 --> 04:37.678
ARE AS FRIENDLY
AS HER COWORKERS.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.380
SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG
TO FIND OUT.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.815
THERE ARE ONLY THREE TENANTS
IN THE BUILDING.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.018
- THE WOMAN WHO LIVED
ABOVE ELLEN FOR TEN YEARS

04:45.052 --> 04:46.620
SAID SHE NEVER MADE A PEEP.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.489
SURE NOT THE ELLEN
WE SAW IN THE VIDEO.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.723
- THE STORY OF ELLEN'S LIFE--

04:49.757 --> 04:52.092
THE GUY ON THREE
SAID SHE WAS SO SHY,

04:52.125 --> 04:53.561
WOULDN'T EVEN SAY HELLO
IN THE ELEVATOR.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.529
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER TENANT
IN THE BUILDING?

04:55.563 --> 04:57.965
- A MAUREEN ELAND.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.900
NEIGHBOR SAYS THAT SHE TRAVELS
A LOT FOR WORK.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.102
- I DO.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.837
- YOU KNOW ELLEN SAZELIN?

05:03.871 --> 05:06.006
- NOT REALLY.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HER?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.041
- I'M SORRY.
SHE'S DEAD.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.378
- OH, MY GOD.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.080
- YOU EVER NOTICE ANYONE
GOING IN AND OUT OF HER PLACE?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.849
- NOT THAT I SAW.
YOU SHOULD TALK TO ANDREAS.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.352
- THE ARTIST
WHO OWNS THE GALLERY?

05:18.386 --> 05:20.087
- WHEN HE'S NOT PAINTING,
HE'S PROWLING.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.955
CREEP SHOWED UP AT MY DOOR
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

05:21.989 --> 05:23.391
WITH A BOTTLE OF WINE.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.892
I DRANK TOO MUCH
AND FELL ASLEEP,

05:24.925 --> 05:28.128
AND I WOKE UP,
AND HE WAS ON TOP OF ME.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.030
- DID HE RAPE YOU?
- HE TRIED.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.132
I SCREAMED
AND PUSHED HIM OFF.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.101
UH, HE SPLIT.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.103
- DID YOU CALL THE COPS?
- NO.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.906
I HAD DRANK TOO MUCH.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.974
PLUS, HE OWNS THE BUILDING,

05:41.008 --> 05:43.444
AND THE VERY NEXT DAY,
HE GAVE ME A BREAK ON MY RENT.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.515
- ANDREAS?
- GALLERY'S CLOSED!

05:47.548 --> 05:48.849
CAN'T YOU READ?

05:48.882 --> 05:50.618
- GLAD TO SEE
THAT LAST NIGHT'S MURDER

05:50.651 --> 05:52.686
DIDN'T STIFLE
YOUR CREATIVITY.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.122
- UH, LOOK, I ALREADY
TOLD THE COPS

05:55.155 --> 05:57.124
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
EXCEPT FOR THE, UH, BLOOD

05:57.157 --> 05:58.926
WHICH DRIPPED IN
FROM THE CEILING THERE.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.462
RIGHT, BABY?
- THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD THEM.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.796
HE'S ALL ABOUT THE TRUTH,
YOU KNOW?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.965
- CAN YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?
- SURE.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.735
BUT DON'T UPSET HIM
AND SCREW UP HIS MOJO.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.506
- SO, PICASSO, WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME YOU SAW ELLEN SAZELIN?

06:12.540 --> 06:13.741
- AH, I DON'T KNOW, LIKE...

06:13.774 --> 06:15.409
COUPLE WEEKS MAYBE?

06:15.443 --> 06:17.845
SHE'S NOT EXACTLY THE TYPE
TO GRAB MY ATTENTION.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.080
- REALLY? 'CAUSE WE HEARD
YOU LIKE TO MEET THE NEIGHBORS.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.149
SURE YOU DIDN'T POP UPSTAIRS
WITH A BOTTLE OF VINO?

06:22.182 --> 06:23.651
- YEAH, INVITE YOURSELF IN,

06:23.684 --> 06:25.686
RAPE ELLEN TO INSPIRE
YOUR, UH, MOJO?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.721
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
MAUREEN?

06:27.755 --> 06:29.423
'CAUSE SHE INVITED
ME UP, OKAY?

06:29.457 --> 06:31.559
AND THEN ONCE I WAS INSIDE,
SHE JUMPED ME.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.594
LOOK, I MEAN, I WIPED MY HANDS
OF HER MONTHS AGO,

06:33.627 --> 06:35.763
AND I'M DONE
WITH YOU TOO, OKAY?

06:35.796 --> 06:37.197
LEAVE.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.933
HEY, GET AWAY FROM THAT!

06:45.773 --> 06:49.009
- IS THAT BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS?

06:49.042 --> 06:52.780
- SON OF A BITCH USED HER BLOOD
TO PAINT WITH.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.515
- I WAS NEVER IN ELLEN'S LOFT.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.084
I JUST INCORPORATED WHAT HAD
ALREADY DRIPPED ONTO THE CANVAS.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.187
- AND HID IT FROM THE COPS
WHEN THEY QUESTIONED YOU.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.054
WHY?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.457
- THE ONLY PIECE I SOLD
WAS TO CINDI.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.925
I HAD TO FINISH IT.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.194
- SO PART OF THE DEAL
WAS FOR HER TO POSE NAKED TO...

07:07.227 --> 07:08.696
INSPIRE YOU?

07:08.729 --> 07:11.532
- HEY, WHATEVER GETS
THE JUICES FLOWING.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.568
- YOUR MUSE ALSO TOLD
A PATROL OFFICER

07:14.602 --> 07:16.870
THAT SHE CAME TO THE GALLERY
AN HOUR BEFORE THE SHOW,

07:16.904 --> 07:18.238
AND SHE COULDN'T FIND
YOU ANYWHERE.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.173
- I LEFT FOR A WHILE.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.042
- TO GO UPSTAIRS
AND RAPE ELLEN SAZELIN.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.044
- [chuckling]

07:24.077 --> 07:25.846
I WAS DOWN THE BLOCK.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.649
A GUY NAMED MICHAEL SPERO
RUNS A BLOG

07:28.682 --> 07:30.250
CALLED OUTRAGEOUS ARTISTS.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.620
HE WAS INTERVIEWING ME ONLINE

07:32.653 --> 07:35.523
FOR AN HOUR ABOUT MY SHOW.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.858
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.594
I'M SAYING THAT TO--
YOU KNOW, IF YOU OWN MY WORK,

07:40.628 --> 07:42.496
IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO OWN MY WORK--

07:42.530 --> 07:43.997
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND

07:44.031 --> 07:45.866
THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE
BEHIND THE WORK,

07:45.899 --> 07:47.267
OR YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE ABLE TO GET IT,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.036
NO MATTER HOW LONG
YOU LOOK AT IT.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.004
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO GRASP IT FULLY,

07:51.038 --> 07:52.573
FULLY APPRECIATE--
- THE GUY MAY BE

07:52.606 --> 07:54.542
A PRETENTIOUS DOUCHE,
BUT HE'S NOT LYING.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.244
HE NEVER HAD TIME
TO GO UP TO ELLEN'S PLACE.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.513
- SO SHE'S GOT NO FRIENDS,
NO VISITORS.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.248
YOU GOT
ANYTHING ELSE ON HER?

08:01.281 --> 08:04.151
- YEAH, SHE WAS AN ONLY CHILD.
PARENTS ARE DECEASED.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.120
NEVER MARRIED, LIVED IN THE CITY
HER ENTIRE LIFE,

08:07.154 --> 08:08.956
AND NEVER HAD AS MUCH
AS A TRAFFIC TICKET.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.223
- AND ACCORDING
TO THE NEIGHBORS,

08:10.257 --> 08:12.526
SHE HAD ZERO SOCIAL LIFE.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.663
SO WHERE DID SHE MEET A GUY
THAT RAPED AND KILLED HER?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.998
- COULD BE A RANDOM GRAB--
PERP SNATCHED HER OFF THE STREET

08:18.031 --> 08:20.067
AND FORCED HER INTO HER PLACE
WITH A WEAPON.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.536
- OR SHE COULD HAVE MET HIM
THROUGH HER WORK.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.240
WELL, BUSINESS MUST BE GOOD
FOR LUSCIOUS GRAPE.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.942
THEY JUST WERE AWARDED
THE MEDAL OF EXCELLENCE

08:28.976 --> 08:31.011
BY SOME FANCY WINE MAGAZINE?

08:31.044 --> 08:34.748
- THEY ALSO PUBLISH TESTIMONIALS
FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.651
- "I ADORE BEING
A MEMBER OF THE LG FAMILY."

08:37.685 --> 08:39.987
"NOT ONLY ARE YOU WONDERFUL
BUSINESSPEOPLE,

08:40.020 --> 08:41.922
YOU'RE WONDERFUL PEOPLE."

08:41.955 --> 08:44.057
"THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR
PERSONAL TIME AND ATTENTION."

08:44.091 --> 08:45.859
- SOUNDS TOO LOVEY-DOVEY
TO ME.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.327
- SO YOU'RE NOT BUYING
THE HYPE EITHER.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.997
- COME ON, NO COMPANY
SATISFIES EVERY CUSTOMER.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.899
MAYBE SOMEONE
GOT PISSED OFF AT ELLEN

08:51.932 --> 08:53.266
AND TOOK IT OUT ON HER.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.103
LET'S ASK ELLEN'S BUSINESS
PARTNER, ANNETTE COLE.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.107
- I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S GONE.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.343
ELLEN AND I...
WERE BEST FRIENDS FOR YEARS.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.946
SHE WAS THE YOUNGER SISTER
I NEVER HAD.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.881
- WE'RE VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.050
- SHE WAS SO UPBEAT
LAST NIGHT.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.085
SAID THIS YEAR
WAS GONNA BE OUR BEST YET.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.921
- WHAT TIME WAS THIS?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.188
- 6:00.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.891
WE DO DINNER, UH,
ONCE A WEEK AT ANGELINO'S.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.094
UH, AFTERWARDS,
SHE HEADED HOME

09:21.128 --> 09:24.064
SO SHE COULD GET A JUMP
ON OUR CORPORATE RETURNS.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.199
- SOUNDS LIKE LUSCIOUS GRAPE
WAS HER LIFE.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.035
- HERS AND MINE.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.871
WE STARTED IT IN A GARAGE
IN JERSEY CITY.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.641
EVERYBODY SAID WE'D BE
OUT OF BUSINESS IN SIX MONTHS.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.243
LAST YEAR OUR SALES
WERE OVER $15 MILLION.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.111
- AND YOU AND ELLEN
WERE THE ONLY OWNERS?

09:38.145 --> 09:40.313
- UH, WE HAVE TEN EMPLOYEES,

09:40.347 --> 09:42.182
BUT WE ALL HOLD STOCK.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.317
WE'RE MORE LIKE A FAMILY
THAN A BUSINESS.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.386
- YOU HAVE ANY DISPUTES
WITH CUSTOMERS OR VENDORS?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.922
- WELL, EVERY TRANSACTION
WAS ABOVEBOARD,

09:48.956 --> 09:50.691
THANKS TO ELLEN.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.359
I MEAN, I MAY BE
THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE COMPANY,

09:52.392 --> 09:54.728
BUT ELLEN
WAS THE BRAINS BEHIND IT--

09:54.762 --> 09:56.830
A GENIUS WITH NUMBERS.

09:56.864 --> 09:59.900
TOGETHER, WE MADE ONE HELL
OF A BUSINESSWOMAN.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.635
- DID ELLEN HAVE
ANY OUTSIDE FRIENDS?

10:01.669 --> 10:03.270
MAYBE A BOYFRIEND?

10:03.303 --> 10:05.405
- OH, SHE NEVER GAVE HERSELF
THE CHANCE TO DATE.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.407
SHE SPENT SO MUCH TIME HERE.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.943
I WAS AFRAID
SHE WAS GONNA BURN OUT.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.179
- WHO WAS SHE FRIENDLY WITH
AT WORK?

10:12.212 --> 10:15.082
- OH, THE HEAD OF ADVERTISING,
BRUCE CLARKSON.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.651
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THEY WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

10:17.685 --> 10:18.986
[sniffles]
BUT...

10:19.019 --> 10:21.722
BRUCE HAS A BOYFRIEND.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.992
- OTHER THAN MY PARTNER, JACK,
ELLEN WAS MY BEST FRIEND--

10:25.025 --> 10:28.361
INCREDIBLY KIND,
A BLAST AT PARTIES.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.097
- REALLY?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.666
'CAUSE WE HEARD
THAT SHE DIDN'T GO OUT MUCH.

10:32.700 --> 10:37.170
- ELLEN PREFERRED TO SOCIALIZE
WITH ME AND MY CIRCLE.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.707
SOME PEOPLE AROUND HERE
CALLED HER A FRUIT FLY.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.909
- MEANING SHE LIKED GAY MEN
MORE THAN STRAIGHT MEN?

10:41.942 --> 10:44.678
- ELLEN SAID THAT STRAIGHT GUYS
ONLY CARED ABOUT THE SURFACE,

10:44.712 --> 10:46.379
AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE
THE LOOKS.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.682
THE ONLY WAY
SHE COULD APPROACH A GUY

10:48.716 --> 10:50.250
WAS IF SHE WAS SLOSHED.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.752
THAT'S WHY SHE DRANK SO MUCH.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.386
- SHE HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.856
- SECRETLY.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.860
I DON'T THINK
EVEN ANNETTE KNEW.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.995
THEN...

11:02.029 --> 11:03.964
UH, ONE NIGHT
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO,

11:03.997 --> 11:05.465
I SAW ELLEN IN HERE
WORKING LATE,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.100
JUST BOMBED OUT OF HER MIND.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.937
I HAD A PROBLEM OF MY OWN,
SO WE WENT TO A.A. TOGETHER

11:09.970 --> 11:11.772
AND HAVE BEEN SOBER
EVER SINCE.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.941
- WELL, IT APPEARS

11:13.974 --> 11:16.343
THAT SHE'D BEEN DRINKING
THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.380
- OH, NO.

11:20.413 --> 11:24.017
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW
SHE'D FALLEN OFF THE WAGON.

11:24.051 --> 11:27.287
- ELLEN DID SEEM
OUT OF IT LATELY,

11:27.320 --> 11:30.057
JITTERY AND PREOCCUPIED.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.126
- DID YOU ASK HER
IF SOMETHING WAS WRONG?

11:33.160 --> 11:36.029
- LAST WEEK
IN THE PARKING GARAGE,

11:36.063 --> 11:37.364
SHE WAS ON HER CELL.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.032
I COULD HEAR THE PERSON
ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE

11:39.066 --> 11:40.100
SCREAMING AT HER.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.102
WHEN SHE SAW ME,
SHE HUNG UP.

11:42.135 --> 11:46.339
SHE SAID IT WAS NOTHING,
BUT SHE WAS REALLY RATTLED.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.310
- I DUMPED ELLEN SAZELIN'S PHONE
FOR THE PAST MONTH,

11:50.343 --> 11:52.079
LEFT ARE OUTGOING,
RIGHT ARE INCOMING CALLS.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.415
AND I THINK I MAY KNOW
WHO'S BEEN HARASSING HER.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.484
THIS NUMBER SHE CALLED
FOUR TIMES

11:57.517 --> 11:59.319
IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.055
- THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END
CALLED HER, WHAT, 50 TIMES?

12:02.089 --> 12:04.792
- MORE LIKE 63 TIMES,
ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.493
- WELL, NO WONDER
SHE WAS JITTERY.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.327
THE GUY WAS HARASSING HER.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.261
- LAST TIME THIS GUY
CALLED HER BACK

12:08.295 --> 12:10.764
IT WAS THREE HOURS
BEFORE SHE WAS MURDERED.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.033
- THIS WAS ON HER VOICE MAIL.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.403
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU, BITCH,
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME WHAT I WANT.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.939
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.
I'M WATCHING YOU.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.774
- WHO'S THE STALKER?
- NUMBER BELONGS

12:20.808 --> 12:23.043
TO A BUSINESS CALLED
"MY LEATHER FANTASY."

12:23.076 --> 12:25.846
- ACCOUNTANT BY DAY,
DOMINATRIX BY NIGHT?

12:25.879 --> 12:28.315
- NO, NOT "S" AND "M"--
HIGH-END ITALIAN HANDBAGS,

12:28.348 --> 12:29.917
WALLETS, GLOVES, AND SHOES.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.551
- AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.922
- WEBSITE SAYS IT'S OWNED
BY AN EDWARD ROSS STANTON

12:34.955 --> 12:37.090
WHO LIVES ON PARK AVENUE.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.826
BUT I ROUTED THE PHONES
TO AN OFFICE

12:38.859 --> 12:42.095
RENTED BY A TWO-TIME HUMP
NAMED JUAN ALVAREZ.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.968
- KNOCK, KNOCK!

12:48.001 --> 12:49.803
HEY, I'M LOOKING
FOR A LEATHER FANTASY.

12:49.837 --> 12:53.540
NAME IS NYPD--HEY!

12:56.509 --> 12:59.512
- I SCREWED UP MY SHOULDER
BUSTING IN YOUR BACK DOOR.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.548
DON'T MAKE ME BREAK
MY FIST ON YOUR FACE.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.884
- I SWEAR I DIDN'T THREATEN
NOBODY, MAN!

13:03.917 --> 13:06.219
- YEAH. WHAT'S THIS?
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU, BITCH,

13:06.253 --> 13:07.520
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME
WHAT I WANT.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.823
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE,
AND I'M WATCHING YOU.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.558
- TECHNOLOGY'S AMAZING.

13:13.927 --> 13:17.130
- [groaning]
- POLICE! UP AGAINST THE WALL!

13:17.164 --> 13:18.465
- FIN, CALL A BUS.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.368
- YOU KILLED MY WIFE!

13:21.401 --> 13:25.072
MURDERER!
YOU KILLED MY PEGGY!

13:30.978 --> 13:33.981
- HE MURDERED MY PEGGY.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.316
- MR. GILCREST,
WE HAVE NO RECORDS

13:36.349 --> 13:38.451
OF YOUR WIFE BEING MURDERED

13:38.485 --> 13:41.021
BY JUAN ALVAREZ
OR ANYONE ELSE.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.890
- YOU DON'T ALWAYS
NEED A WEAPON

13:42.923 --> 13:45.058
TO COMMIT MURDER.

13:45.092 --> 13:48.028
- MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.497
- PEGGY HAD
EARLY ALZHEIMER'S.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.336
RIGHT BEFORE THANKSGIVING,
I WAS T-THINKING SHE WAS ASLEEP.

13:56.369 --> 14:01.074
I WENT OUT TO THE STORE.
THAT'S WHEN SHE GOT ONLINE...

14:01.108 --> 14:04.544
AND STARTED SHOPPING
AT MY LEATHER FANTASY.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.314
- THAT OLD BROAD BOUGHT
FIVE GRAND WORTH OF MERCHANDISE.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.884
WHEN HER HUSBAND CALLED,
I TOLD HIM NO REFUNDS,

14:10.918 --> 14:12.185
NO RETURNS.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.087
- PISSED HIM OFF.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.456
- HE STARTED YELLING,
SAID HE WAS GONNA SUE ME.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.191
- WELL,
YOUR PHONE RECORDS SHOW

14:18.225 --> 14:19.592
THAT YOU CALLED THEM
DOZENS OF TIMES,

14:19.626 --> 14:20.994
USUALLY IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.631
- OKAY.
SO I HARASSED THE BITCH.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.033
- SHE STARTED HAVING
PANIC ATTACKS

14:26.066 --> 14:28.568
WHENEVER THE PHONE RANG.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.371
TWO DAYS AGO, HE CALLED...

14:34.107 --> 14:37.110
AND MY POOR PEGGY COLLAPSED.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.412
HER HEART GAVE OUT.

14:39.446 --> 14:43.050
HE KILLED MY WIFE.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.385
- YOU HOUNDED MRS. GILCREST
TO DEATH.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.387
- NO, I DIDN'T.
I TOLD HER IF SHE WASN'T HAPPY,

14:47.420 --> 14:49.456
SHE COULD POST NEGATIVE STUFF
ABOUT ME ON THE INTERNET.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.925
- COME AGAIN?

14:51.959 --> 14:54.061
- THE MORE COMMENTS
YOU GET ONLINE, GOOD OR BAD,

14:54.094 --> 14:56.529
THE HIGHER
YOUR GOOGLE RANKING.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.299
- SCARING PEOPLE TO DEATH
IS NOW A MARKETING PLOY?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.168
- FOR EVERY
PISSED-OFF CUSTOMER,

15:01.201 --> 15:03.236
100 NEW PEOPLE
VISIT MY WEBSITE.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.338
10% TO 20% OF THEM
BUY SOMETHING...

15:05.372 --> 15:07.540
KA-CHING!
[laughs]

15:07.574 --> 15:10.143
- YOU ARE SOME PIECE OF CRAP,
YOU KNOW THAT?

15:10.177 --> 15:12.245
- BUT I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.081
LET'S...

15:14.114 --> 15:16.183
LET'S TALK ABOUT
ONE OF YOUR OTHER CUSTOMERS,

15:16.216 --> 15:17.384
ELLEN SAZELIN.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.286
NOW, YOUR 63RD CALL TO HER

15:19.319 --> 15:21.354
CAME THREE HOURS BEFORE
SHE WAS RAPED AND MURDERED.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.423
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO BOOST
MY SEARCH RATINGS.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.225
- BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,
SO YOU DECIDED TO STALK HER?

15:25.258 --> 15:27.027
- NO!
- SHE COMES HOME,

15:27.060 --> 15:29.129
YOU FOLLOW HER IN,
BUT YOU GET OUT OF CONTROL?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.663
- I NEVER WENT NEAR
HER HOUSE.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.699
- REALLY?
W-WELL, WHERE WERE YOU?

15:32.732 --> 15:35.202
- SCARING THE CRAP
OUT OF MARY ANN FITZGERALD--

15:35.235 --> 15:37.971
3209 NETHERLAND AVENUE
IN THE BRONX.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.973
SHE CAME OUTSIDE
ON HER FRONT PORCH,

15:40.007 --> 15:42.042
STARTED SCREAMING
HER ASS OFF AT ME.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.144
GO ASK HER.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.447
- IT'S NOT ALVAREZ.
MARY ANN FITZGERALD CONFIRMS.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.983
HE WAS ACROSS FROM HER HOUSE
FROM 6:00 TO 10:00

15:50.017 --> 15:51.284
THE NIGHT ELLEN SAZELIN
WAS MURDERED.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.219
- BUT HE'S STILL GOING DOWN.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.988
WE GOT HIM COLD
ON SECOND-DEGREE MENACING.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.124
- AND WE GOT NO ONE
FOR ELLEN SAZELIN'S MURDER.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.359
- IF IT WAS MURDER.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.661
I'M RULING ELLEN'S MANNER
OF DEATH AS UNDETERMINED.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.196
- WAIT A MINUTE.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

16:03.230 --> 16:05.098
THAT SHE WAS RAPED
AND HAD HER THROAT SLIT.

16:05.132 --> 16:09.069
- BUT THE AUTOPSY FOUND
NO DNA ON OR NEAR HER PERSON,

16:09.102 --> 16:11.204
AND CSU FOUND NO FINGERPRINTS
IN THE APARTMENT BUT HERS.

16:11.238 --> 16:14.041
- WELL, THE PERP
COULD HAVE WORN GLOVES.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.175
- OR SHE WAS SO DRUNK,

16:15.208 --> 16:17.344
SHE ACCIDENTALLY FELL
ON THAT VASE AND BLED TO DEATH.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.712
HER BLOOD ALCOHOL WAS 1.6.

16:19.746 --> 16:23.283
I ALSO FOUND HEALING BRUISES
ON HER ARMS AND LEGS

16:23.316 --> 16:25.118
AND A FRESH BRUISE
ON HER BACK

16:25.152 --> 16:27.254
FROM A FEW HOURS
BEFORE SHE DIED.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.057
- WELL, WE DID ONLY FIND
ONE WINEGLASS AT THE SCENE.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.258
MAYBE ELLEN
FELL OFF THE WAGON,

16:31.291 --> 16:33.593
SHE DOWNED A WHOLE BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE, AND SHE TRIPPED.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.229
- AND GOT ANAL TRAUMA
ON THE WAY DOWN?

16:36.263 --> 16:37.364
- A REACTION TO STRESS--

16:37.397 --> 16:39.166
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
PLEASURING HERSELF

16:39.199 --> 16:41.168
WITH SOME KIND OF INSTRUMENT
AND GOT TOO VIOLENT.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.270
- CSU FOUND SEX TOYS
IN HER APARTMENT.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.173
- AND WHEN I GOT HER
ON THE SLAB...

16:46.206 --> 16:47.374
I DISCOVERED
SHE HAD BALD SPOTS

16:47.407 --> 16:49.142
SHE TRIED TO HIDE
WITH HAIR EXTENSIONS.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.144
- SHE PULLED HER HAIR OUT?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.712
- SHE SUFFERED
FROM TRICHOTILLOMANIA,

16:52.745 --> 16:53.846
ANOTHER REACTION
TO SEVERE STRESS,

16:53.880 --> 16:57.217
ALONG WITH THE VIOLENT
MASTURBATION AND BINGE DRINKING.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.153
- ANY IDEA HOW LONG
SHE WAS STRESSED OUT?

17:00.187 --> 17:02.189
- BASED ON THE HAIR
THAT'S REGROWN...

17:02.222 --> 17:03.523
I'D SAY MONTHS.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.058
- WOW.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.427
SHE WAS REALLY
HURTING HERSELF.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.630
[glasses clink]
- CHEERS.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.465
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.700
- CHEERS.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.237
- EVERYONE AT LUSCIOUS GRAPE
SAID THEY WERE ALL SO CLOSE--

17:17.270 --> 17:19.472
ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY.

17:19.506 --> 17:23.276
WOULDN'T YOU NOTICE IF YOUR
SISTER WAS PULLING HER HAIR OUT?

17:23.310 --> 17:25.478
- I DON'T KNOW WHY ELLEN
WAS SO STRESSED OUT.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.747
- WELL, YOU SAID
SHE SEEMED JITTERY.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.216
- I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS

17:29.249 --> 17:31.818
FROM PUTTING IN
SO MUCH TIME AT WORK...

17:31.851 --> 17:34.587
JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.789
- ELLEN NEVER SAID ANYTHING
TO ME EXCEPT "HI" IN THE MORNING

17:36.823 --> 17:38.325
AND "GOOD-BYE" AT NIGHT.

17:38.358 --> 17:41.261
- SO YOU NEVER SAW HER
LOOKING UPSET OR DEPRESSED?

17:41.294 --> 17:44.297
- THIS IS A GREAT COMPANY.
THEY TREAT US LIKE GOLD HERE.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.299
EVERYONE'S ALWAYS CHEERY
AND SMILING,

17:46.333 --> 17:47.567
INCLUDING ELLEN.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.271
- "CHEERY"? YOU JUST SAID THAT
SHE BARELY SPOKE A WORD TO YOU.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.640
- YES, BUT WHEN SHE DID,
IT WAS WITH A SMILE.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.109
- I DIDN'T KNOW ELLEN
THAT WELL, BUT...

17:56.143 --> 17:57.744
HER DEATH
IS A HUGE LOSS TO ALL OF US.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.212
- YOU BEEN WORKING HERE
SINCE DAY ONE,

17:59.246 --> 18:00.847
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW HER
THAT WELL?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.715
- I'M THE TOP SALESMAN,

18:02.749 --> 18:04.817
AND EVEN WHEN I DO COME
BY THE OFFICE, IT--

18:04.851 --> 18:07.154
- [giggles]

18:07.187 --> 18:09.422
- A GIRL LIKE ELLEN
REALLY ISN'T YOUR TYPE.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.424
- [chuckles]
LOOK...

18:11.458 --> 18:14.361
THIS COMPANY TREATS
EVERYBODY GREAT, ESPECIALLY ME.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.363
IF THERE'S ANY OFFICE GOSSIP,

18:16.396 --> 18:18.198
I'M OUT OF THE LOOP.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.632
- IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO WORK.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.269
THERE'S NOTHING
TO GOSSIP ABOUT HERE.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.370
- REALLY?

18:23.403 --> 18:25.472
USUALLY THE SMALLER THE COMPANY,
THE BETTER THE DIRT.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.839
- I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.841
THAT'S NOT LUSCIOUS GRAPE.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.145
ELLEN WAS BRILLIANT
AT WHAT SHE DID.

18:32.179 --> 18:35.348
HER DEATH
IS A TERRIBLE BLOW.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.717
- IT'S ONLY NOW
REALLY SINKING IN.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.386
MY FRIEND...

18:39.419 --> 18:41.288
MY PARTNER IS GONE.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.791
I KEEP EXPECTING TO HEAR HER
LAUGH COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.593
- ANNETTE...
IT'S TIME.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.428
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.397
WE'RE HEADED
TO THE MEMORIAL SERVICE.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.804
- EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE
MADE SURE TO TELL US

18:57.837 --> 18:59.339
THAT ELLEN'S DEATH
WAS A HUGE LOSS.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.240
[cell phone rings]

19:00.273 --> 19:02.275
- LIKE SOMEBODY TOLD THEM
WHAT TO SAY.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.710
OLIVIA BENSON.
- WE BETTER FIND SOMETHING

19:03.743 --> 19:05.445
MORE THAN SUSPICIONS
FOR HARDWICKE,

19:05.478 --> 19:06.913
OR WE'RE GONNA BE STUCK
WITH WARNER'S FINDINGS

19:06.946 --> 19:09.416
THAT ELLEN DIED
IN A DRUNKEN STUPOR.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.451
- MAYBE HER GHOST
IS HAUNTING HER LOFT.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.453
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
SOMEONE'S IN HER APARTMENT?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.455
- ANDREAS JUST CALLED.
HE SAID HE HEARD LOUD NOISES,

19:15.488 --> 19:17.457
LIKE SOMEBODY
WAS WRECKING THE APARTMENT.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.560
- I'LL TELL PATROL
TO MEET YOU THERE.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.962
- THE CRIME-SCENE SEAL
ON THE FRONT DOOR WAS BROKEN.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.497
I ENTERED, ANNOUNCED,
AND SAW A FIGURE

19:24.531 --> 19:26.266
RACING DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.600
- MALE OR FEMALE FIGURE?
- I COULDN'T TELL--

19:27.634 --> 19:28.935
WAS WEARING PANTS
AND A HOODIE.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.803
I LOST HIM BY THE TIME
I REACHED THE STREET.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.739
- WELL, WE SPOOKED
SOMEBODY FROM LG.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.308
THEY RACED OVER HERE AS SOON AS
THE MEMORIAL SERVICE WAS OVER.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.910
- TORE THIS PLACE APART
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.413
WELL, ELLEN'S COMPUTER'S
GOT A BUNCH OF FILES OPEN.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.483
- CSU CLONED HER HARD DRIVE.
THEY DIDN'T FIND A THING.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.985
MAYBE ELLEN BACKED IT UP
AND HID IT SOMEWHERE?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.355
- UH...

19:53.526 --> 19:55.595
HOW ABOUT IN A PANDA?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.330
- FLASH DRIVE.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.832
- 20 MPEGs.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.434
LOOKS LIKE ALL OF THEM
SHOT AT LUSCIOUS GRAPE.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.470
- BUT WHY IS SHE MAKING
MOVIES AT WORK?

20:03.503 --> 20:04.771
- WELL, LET'S SEE.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.839
FILMED HERSELF
WITH A WEBCAM, HUH?

20:06.873 --> 20:10.477
- IT'S WEDNESDAY,
JANUARY 26TH,

20:10.510 --> 20:12.011
4:00 P.M.
[Annette yelling in background]

20:12.044 --> 20:14.481
IT'S THE THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.
- YOU'RE ALL INCOMPETENT!

20:14.514 --> 20:15.815
- THAT'S ANNETTE.
- DAVID!

20:15.848 --> 20:18.385
I JUST WENT THROUGH
THESE INVENTORIES MYSELF.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.520
YOU MISSED THREE CASES!
DO IT AGAIN!

20:20.553 --> 20:23.323
AND YOU, CORRINE, YOU CAN WIPE
THAT SMIRK OFF YOUR FACE,

20:23.356 --> 20:26.526
WITH THIS CRAP
YOU'VE BEEN DOING!

20:26.559 --> 20:28.628
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
YOU BIG FRUIT?

20:28.661 --> 20:30.463
[papers rustle loudly]

20:30.497 --> 20:33.400
DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO ACCEPT THIS AD?

20:33.433 --> 20:35.268
THIS IS THE 21ST CENTURY.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.536
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR JOB,

20:36.569 --> 20:40.507
I SUGGEST YOU GIVE ME
SOME DECENT WORK!

20:40.540 --> 20:43.910
AND YOU, YOU LAZY BITCH!
YOU'RE THE WORST OF ALL!

20:43.943 --> 20:46.045
I JUST FOUND THREE TYPOS!

20:46.078 --> 20:48.315
- ANNETTE,
JUST PLEASE CALM DOWN.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.382
- SCREW YOU.

20:49.416 --> 20:53.486
ALL THESE YEARS, I HAVE BEEN
CARRYING YOU, ELLEN.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.424
I COULD DO THOSE DAMN BOOKS
WITH MY ARM TIED BEHIND MY BACK!

20:57.457 --> 20:58.725
NOW, LET'S GET INTO MY OFFICE.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.627
- NO, I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WITH YOU

21:00.660 --> 21:02.362
UNTIL YOU LOWER YOUR VOICE.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.397
- OH, REALLY?
- [whimpers]

21:04.431 --> 21:06.433
OH!
[crying]

21:08.601 --> 21:10.470
- LUSCIOUS GRAPE
ON THE OUTSIDE,

21:10.503 --> 21:12.305
POISON ON THE INSIDE.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.606
- NO WONDER THEY ALL PRETENDED

21:13.640 --> 21:15.074
THAT EVERYTHING
WAS SO WONDERFUL.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.577
THEY WERE SCARED THAT ANNETTE'S
GONNA FIRE THEM.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.678
- OR KILL THEM.

21:23.983 --> 21:27.086
- AND YOU, YOU LAZY BITCH!
YOU'RE THE WORST OF ALL!

21:27.119 --> 21:29.322
I JUST FOUND THREE TYPOS!

21:29.356 --> 21:30.757
- ANNETTE,
JUST PLEASE CALM DOWN.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.325
- SCREW YOU.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.428
ALL THESE YEARS, I HAVE BEEN
CARRYING YOU, ELLEN.

21:35.462 --> 21:40.433
I COULD DO THOSE DAMN BOOKS
WITH MY ARM TIED BEHIND MY BACK!

21:40.467 --> 21:42.835
NOW, LET'S GET INTO MY OFFICE.
- NO, NO--

21:42.869 --> 21:44.937
- I WAS ELLEN'S FRIEND.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.906
WE WERE JUST HAVING
A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.541
- YOU WERE
PUBLICLY BERATING HER

21:48.575 --> 21:50.943
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
ON YOUR STAFF.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.746
- SOMEBODY IS TRYING
TO MAKE ME LOOK BAD.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.848
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?
- ELLEN'S APARTMENT.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.650
GUESS YOU DIDN'T LOOK
HARD ENOUGH.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.452
- WELL, YOU BROKE
INTO ELLEN'S LOFT LAST NIGHT

21:59.486 --> 22:00.653
LOOKING FOR THIS.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.355
NOW, I CAN'T SAY
THAT I BLAME YOU.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.056
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO SEE THIS EITHER.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.593
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?

22:06.626 --> 22:08.428
ELLEN TOLD YOU
THAT SHE'D RECORDED THE RANTS

22:08.461 --> 22:09.929
AND SHE WAS GONNA
SHOW THEM TO THE WORLD?

22:09.962 --> 22:12.098
- OR DID SHE JUST WANT
THE SISTER SHE NEVER HAD

22:12.131 --> 22:14.066
TO STOP BEATING
THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF HER?

22:14.100 --> 22:17.036
- THAT TAPE'S DOCTORED.
- YOU WISH.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.805
OUR TECHS CHECKED IT OUT,
AND IT'S REAL,

22:18.838 --> 22:20.139
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER
TAPES SHE MADE.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.809
- OTHER TAPES?
- 20 LITTLE HORROR FILMS...

22:22.842 --> 22:24.777
ALL OF THEM STARRING YOU.

22:29.916 --> 22:33.386
- I PUSH EVERYONE
AS HARD AS I PUSH MYSELF.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.621
- NO, YOU'RE
A SCHOOLYARD BULLY

22:34.654 --> 22:36.022
WHO PREYS
ON THE WEAKEST KID.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.124
- ELLEN PREYED ON ME.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.960
SHE TREATED ME
LIKE HER PERSONAL ASSISTANT.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.094
- WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

22:42.128 --> 22:43.796
YOU HAD THAT WOMAN
SO STRESSED OUT,

22:43.830 --> 22:46.433
SHE STARTED DRINKING AGAIN.
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA

22:46.466 --> 22:47.967
HOW ARROGANT SHE COULD BE--

22:48.000 --> 22:50.002
ALWAYS TELLING ME I WASN'T
CARRYING MY OWN WEIGHT,

22:50.036 --> 22:51.904
THREATENING TO GANG UP WITH
THE REST OF THEM TO BUY ME OUT.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.573
- ELLEN WAS SCARED
OF HER OWN SHADOW.

22:53.606 --> 22:54.841
YOU BULLIED HER,
AND YOU TREATED HER

22:54.874 --> 22:57.677
LIKE YOUR OWN
PERSONAL PUNCHING BAG.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.945
- YOU ARE TAKING THAT
OUT OF CONTEXT.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.613
ELLEN WAS MY BEST FRIEND!

23:00.647 --> 23:03.683
- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR WAITER
SAID AT ANGELINO'S.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.752
NO, HE SAID THAT THE NIGHT
THAT ELLEN WAS KILLED,

23:05.785 --> 23:07.420
YOU WERE SCREAMING AT HER.

23:07.454 --> 23:08.588
- OH, SHE WAS BEING IMPOSSIBLE

23:08.621 --> 23:10.590
ABOUT CHANGING
IMPORT STRATEGIES,

23:10.623 --> 23:11.991
LORDING HER DAMN NUMBERS
OVER ME.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.026
- THAT VERY SAME WAITER
ALSO SAID

23:14.060 --> 23:16.629
THAT YOU THREW YOUR COFFEE CUP
AT ELLEN WHEN SHE LEFT.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.164
- HE'S LYING!

23:18.197 --> 23:19.699
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
LEFT A BIGGER TIP.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.434
- YOU FOLLOWED HER HOME,
DIDN'T YOU?

23:21.468 --> 23:23.603
YOU FOUND HER DRINKING
HER PAIN AWAY,

23:23.636 --> 23:26.473
AND YOU TRIED BULLYING HER
INTO GIVING YOU THOSE TAPES.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.907
- I WENT DIRECTLY HOME
AFTER DINNER.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.676
- AND WHEN SHE RESISTED,
YOU PUSHED HER,

23:29.709 --> 23:30.810
THE VASE BROKE,
AND YOU WERE SO ANGRY,

23:30.843 --> 23:33.613
YOU GRABBED THE SHARD,
AND YOU JAMMED IT INTO HER NECK.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.482
- [crying] STOP IT.
I LOVED ELLEN.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.583
I WOULD NEVER
HAVE HURT HER!

23:36.616 --> 23:39.452
- EXCEPT WHEN YOU'RE
VERBALLY ABUSING HER TO DEATH

23:39.486 --> 23:40.620
EVERY DAY OF HER LIFE?

23:40.653 --> 23:42.655
- SHE WAS A RECLUSE,
A DRUNK.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.691
I AM THE HEAD
OF A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.493
- YOU'RE A PISSY
LITTLE TYRANT,

23:46.526 --> 23:48.194
AND ELLEN
WAS THE PERFECT VICTIM

23:48.227 --> 23:50.830
BECAUSE
SHE NEVER FOUGHT BACK.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.533
WHO YOU GONNA BEAT UP NOW?

23:53.566 --> 23:55.702
- HOW ABOUT US, ANNETTE?

23:55.735 --> 23:59.005
PICK ON SOMEBODY
WHO'LL FIGHT BACK.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.674
- ARE YOU CHARGING ME
WITH ANYTHING?

24:03.810 --> 24:04.811
- NOT YET.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.746
- THEN I'M LEAVING.

24:08.214 --> 24:10.583
IF YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME AGAIN,

24:10.617 --> 24:12.585
CALL MY ATTORNEY.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.728
- QUEEN OF MEAN'S ON A TEAR.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.730
WHO'S SHE GONNA PUNISH WHEN
SHE GETS BACK TO THE OFFICE?

24:23.763 --> 24:26.198
- MY BET--THEY'RE GONNA SMILE,
PRETEND SHE'S MOTHER TERESA,

24:26.232 --> 24:27.634
AND THEN DUCK.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.235
- IT'S AMAZING THE ABUSE
PEOPLE WILL PUT UP WITH

24:29.268 --> 24:30.703
IN A LOUSY ECONOMY.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.672
- CAN'T WE AT LEAST CHARGE HER
WITH BATTERY?

24:32.705 --> 24:35.575
SHE KNOCKED ELLEN AROUND, AND
SHE HAS THE BRUISES TO PROVE IT.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.944
- WHO'S GONNA BACK US UP?
SOME OF HER FRIENDS AT WORK?

24:37.977 --> 24:39.779
- WITHOUT A CORROBORATING
WITNESS, WE GOT NOTHING.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.815
- WELL, IF WE GO BACK AT 'EM
WITH BETTER AMMO...

24:42.849 --> 24:45.518
I'LL ASK HARDWICKE
TO PULL THE COMPANY'S FINANCIALS

24:45.552 --> 24:47.987
AND SUBPOENA ELLEN'S DISABILITY
AND MEDICAL CLAIMS.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.622
- BULLY'S LIKE A RABID DOG.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.758
WANTS TO TAKE A BITE
OUT OF EVERYBODY.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.994
MAYBE WE CAN GET SOMEBODY ELSE
SHE BIT TO TALK.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.864
- ELLEN FILED FIVE
WORKERS' COMP CLAIMS LAST YEAR?

24:57.897 --> 24:59.231
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THAT?

24:59.265 --> 25:00.633
- AND YOU DIDN'T NOTICE

25:00.667 --> 25:02.669
YOUR BEST FRIEND
WAS ABSENT FROM WORK.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.004
- SHE SAID SHE WAS TRAVELING
ON BUSINESS.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.639
- YOU BOUGHT THAT?

25:06.673 --> 25:08.775
I MEAN, KNOWING HOW
ANNETTE WAS ABUSING HER?

25:08.808 --> 25:11.077
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

25:11.110 --> 25:14.113
- THE TRUTH
ABOUT ANNETTE'S BEHAVIOR.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.015
OR DID THIS $200,000 CAR
THAT SHE BOUGHT YOU

25:16.048 --> 25:18.651
ALSO BUY YOUR SILENCE?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.687
- THIS WAS
MY YEAR-END BONUS.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.989
- TAKING A LITTLE TIME
OFF FROM WORK?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.323
- HAVE YOU BEEN
FOLLOWING ME?

25:24.356 --> 25:26.559
- ALL THE WAY OVER HERE
TO YOUR SHRINK.

25:26.593 --> 25:27.794
WORK GOT YOU STRESSED OUT?

25:27.827 --> 25:29.762
- I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE PROBLEMS?

25:29.796 --> 25:31.998
- LISTEN,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE GETTING SICK

25:32.031 --> 25:34.100
WORRYING THAT AT ANY MINUTE
YOUR BOSS MIGHT FLIP HER LID.

25:34.133 --> 25:38.671
- ANNETTE IS A GREAT BOSS.
I'VE GOT NOTHING MORE TO SAY.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.241
- I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I HAVE TO SAY IT.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.010
LG IS A GREAT PLACE TO WORK.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.646
- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GOT A
PLACE LIKE THIS TO COME HOME TO.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.648
NICE DIGS ANNETTE PAID FOR.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.750
- JUSTIN!
MOTHER NEEDS HER JUICE!

25:50.783 --> 25:54.921
- JUST A MINUTE, MOM!
- I AM PARCHED.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.689
- THAT YOUR MOM?
- MM.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.358
SANG OPERA.
- MM-HMM.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.993
MUST BE WEIRD HAVING
MOMMY SO CLOSE

26:01.027 --> 26:03.129
WHEN YOU'RE BRINGING HOME
ALL THAT HOT TAIL.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.832
- MY MOTHER'S DISABLED.
I TAKE CARE OF HER.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.834
- KIND OF LIKE HOW
YOUR BOSS TAKES CARE OF YOU

26:07.867 --> 26:10.069
SO YOU DON'T BLAB
WHAT A PSYCHO BITCH SHE IS.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.738
- JUSTIN!

26:11.771 --> 26:13.706
- ANNETTE'S GENEROSITY
IS A GODSEND.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.608
I AM LUCKY TO WORK FOR HER.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.810
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M BUSY.

26:17.844 --> 26:18.678
- OH, SURE.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.780
- WORKING FOR ANNETTE
IS A DREAM JOB.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.048
- I'LL SAY.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.382
SHE PULLS STRINGS
TO GET YOUR KIDS

26:23.415 --> 26:25.284
INTO THE WHITETHORNE ACADEMY,

26:25.317 --> 26:27.787
SPRINGS
FOR THE $100,000 TUITION.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.956
- SHE'S THEIR GODMOTHER.
IT'S ALL LEGAL.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.858
- WELL, KILLING
ELLEN SAZELIN WASN'T.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.259
- WHAT HAPPENED TO ELLEN
WAS A TRAGEDY.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.927
HER DEATH IS--
- A GREAT LOSS.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.763
YEAH,
I READ THE PRESS RELEASE.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.130
BUT WHO'S NEXT, DAVID--

26:38.164 --> 26:40.166
YOU, BRUCE, CORRINE?

26:40.199 --> 26:43.369
YOU KNOW ANNETTE'S
TOTALLY LOST CONTROL.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.404
- SHE MIGHT NOT BE PERFECT,

26:45.437 --> 26:48.274
BUT NONE OF US WILL SAY
A BAD WORD ABOUT HER...

26:48.307 --> 26:50.176
EVER.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.378
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

26:52.411 --> 26:54.380
- IT'S A FORM
OF STOCKHOLM SYNDROME.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.749
ANNETTE'S EMPLOYEES
HAVE BONDED TO HER EMOTIONALLY

26:56.783 --> 26:59.185
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.
- LIKE AN ABUSED WIFE

26:59.218 --> 27:00.787
WHO SAYS THAT HER HUSBAND
REALLY LOVES HER

27:00.820 --> 27:01.988
BECAUSE HE BRINGS HER ROSES.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.923
- THEN HE BEATS HER AGAIN,
AND HE BUYS HER ANOTHER PRESENT

27:03.956 --> 27:04.891
TO SAY THAT HE'S SORRY,

27:04.924 --> 27:06.292
AND THE CYCLE
JUST KEEPS REPEATING ITSELF

27:06.325 --> 27:07.794
UNTIL THE VICTIM
THINKS IT'S NORMAL.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.762
- I DON'T KNOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.363
- THIS COULD BE
GOOD OLD-FASHIONED GREED.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.832
I MEAN, IF ANNETTE
GOES DOWN FOR MURDER,

27:12.865 --> 27:15.401
BYE-BYE LUSCIOUS GRAPE,
A STEADY PAYCHECK,

27:15.434 --> 27:16.468
AND ALL THE OTHER GOODIES
THAT GO WITH IT.

27:16.502 --> 27:19.371
- AND THE GOODIES ARE ABOUT
TO GET EVEN BETTER.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.307
A BUDDY OF MINE AT THE S.E.C.

27:21.340 --> 27:25.177
SAYS GLOBACOL
IS ABOUT TO BUY LUSCIOUS GRAPE

27:25.211 --> 27:27.313
FOR $500 MILLION.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.148
- THAT MUCH
FOR A BOOZE DISTRIBUTOR.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.018
- SIDNEY FRANK SOLD GREY GOOSE
FOR $2.3 BILLION.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.253
AND NEXT MONTH,
LUSCIOUS GRAPE IS COMING OUT

27:34.286 --> 27:37.757
WITH A PREMIUM LINE OF VODKA
CALLED POLARA.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.325
- AND ANNETTE'S HOLD
OVER HER EMPLOYEES

27:39.358 --> 27:40.927
JUST GETS
THAT MUCH STRONGER.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.328
SUBPOENAING THEM
AS HOSTILE WITNESSES

27:42.361 --> 27:43.930
WON'T GET YOU ANYTHING.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.198
- HOW DO WE BREAK
ANNETTE'S SPELL?

27:46.232 --> 27:48.467
WHAT, WAIT UNTIL
ANOTHER EMPLOYEE DIES?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.237
- DON'T HAVE TO.
LOOK WHAT JUST HIT THE NEWS.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.372
- YEAH, AMAZING VIDEO--
THE SECRETLY TAPED FOOTAGE

27:53.405 --> 27:56.175
SHOWS ANNETTE COLE,
CEO OF LUSCIOUS GRAPE,

27:56.208 --> 27:58.745
A WELL-REGARDED MANHATTAN
LIQUOR DISTRIBUTOR,

27:58.778 --> 28:02.114
VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY
HARASSING THE COMPANY'S CFO,

28:02.148 --> 28:03.449
ELLEN SAZELIN,

28:03.482 --> 28:06.819
WHO WAS FOUND DEAD
IN HER APARTMENT THREE DAYS AGO.

28:06.853 --> 28:09.822
- NOW, OUR PRODUCERS TELL US
THAT MSNBC RECEIVED THIS PACKAGE

28:09.856 --> 28:12.491
APPARENTLY SENT
BY THE VICTIM HERSELF...

28:12.524 --> 28:15.161
- ELLEN MUST HAVE MAILED IT
AFTER HER DINNER WITH ANNETTE.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.865
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
THE CHURCH MOUSE FINALLY ROARED.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.767
- TV'S NOT THE ONLY PLACE
IT HIT.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.201
IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.405
- "AND YOU THOUGHT
YOUR JOB WAS BAD."

28:26.438 --> 28:28.941
"WORST BOSS EVAH!"

28:28.975 --> 28:30.910
- LOOKS LIKE ANNETTE
WAS JUST FOUND GUILTY

28:30.943 --> 28:32.912
IN THE COURT
OF PUBLIC OPINION.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.948
[reporters murmuring]

28:35.982 --> 28:38.284
- HEY, IT'S THE BULLY BOSS!

28:38.317 --> 28:39.451
- SUCK IT, BITCH!

28:39.485 --> 28:41.353
- BAD DAY, GARBO?
- SCREW YOU.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.289
I'M RUINED.
- LET ME GUESS--

28:43.322 --> 28:44.991
ORDERS CANCELED,
HATE MAIL POURING IN,

28:45.024 --> 28:46.826
PEOPLE CALLING YOU
TO YELL AT YOU?

28:46.859 --> 28:48.327
- HOW'S IT FEEL TO GET
A TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE?

28:48.360 --> 28:49.862
- I KNOW YOU PEOPLE
LEAKED THAT TAPE.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.030
ELLEN WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
THAT TO ME.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.364
- ARE YOU REALLY THAT
DELUSIONAL?

28:52.398 --> 28:54.000
- YOU'LL BE HEARING
FROM MY LAWYER.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.802
I'M SUING THE NYPD
FOR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.

28:55.835 --> 28:56.869
- I HOPE YOU HAVE
A GOOD P.R. PERSON.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.871
- ANNETTE, DID YOU MURDER
YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER?

28:58.905 --> 29:01.007
- LEAVE ME ALONE!
- DID ELLEN SAZELIN KILL HERSELF

29:01.040 --> 29:01.874
BECAUSE OF YEARS
OF YOUR ABUSE?

29:01.908 --> 29:04.176
- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO YOUR COMPANY?

29:04.210 --> 29:05.544
- PROTECT ME.
IT'S YOUR JOB!

29:05.577 --> 29:07.513
- YOU'RE THE BULLY.
SHOW 'EM WHO'S BOSS.

29:07.546 --> 29:10.049
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

29:10.082 --> 29:11.350
- ANNETTE!
- ANNETTE!

29:11.383 --> 29:13.986
- LEAVE ME ALONE!
- ANNETTE! ANNETTE!

29:14.020 --> 29:16.322
- VIDEO SURFACED
SHOWING SHOCKING ABUSE

29:16.355 --> 29:18.891
COMMITTED BY CEO ANNETTE COLE.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.894
GLOBACOL WITHDREW
THEIR HALF-BILLION-DOLLAR OFFER

29:21.928 --> 29:24.230
FOR LUSCIOUS GRAPE,
CITING THEIR MORALS CLAUSE.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.066
- "ANNETTE-A THE HUN."

29:27.099 --> 29:29.468
"BITCHY BOSS POPS."

29:29.501 --> 29:32.038
"LUSCIOUS GRAPE
OR BULLY AND RAPE?"

29:32.071 --> 29:33.305
- SHE REALLY IS RUINED.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.908
- AND TOOK DOWN HER OWN COMPANY
AND ALL ITS EMPLOYEES WITH HER.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.910
- WELL, IF ANY ONE OF THEM
HAD HAD ANY GUTS,

29:37.944 --> 29:39.378
ELLEN MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.113
- DOES A PERSON LIKE THAT
EVER LOOK IN THE MIRROR

29:41.147 --> 29:42.849
AND FACE UP
TO ALL THE DAMAGE SHE'S DONE?

29:42.882 --> 29:43.916
- I THINK SHE ALREADY HAS.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.953
ANNETTE'S LAWYER JUST SCHEDULED
A PRESS CONFERENCE

29:46.986 --> 29:48.220
AT 10:00 A.M.
TOMORROW MORNING.

29:48.254 --> 29:51.057
SHE WANTS TO EXPLAIN HER ACTIONS
ON THAT TAPE.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.925
- YOU MEAN EXPLAIN THEM AWAY.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.527
- SHE ALSO WANTS US
TO BE THERE.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.064
- THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

29:58.097 --> 30:01.500
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT, UM...

30:01.533 --> 30:04.336
I-I NEVER MEANT
TO HARM ANYBODY.

30:04.370 --> 30:07.606
I'M MORTIFIED

30:07.639 --> 30:10.442
BY HOW I MUST LOOK
ON THAT TAPE.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.011
[voice breaking]
BUT...

30:12.044 --> 30:15.948
[sniffles]
TO MY BUSINESS PARTNERS,

30:15.982 --> 30:20.252
LET ME SAY THIS...

30:20.286 --> 30:21.954
[normal voice]
SCREW YOU FOR ABANDONING ME

30:21.988 --> 30:23.389
IN MY TIME OF NEED.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.592
TO MY CUSTOMERS...

30:26.625 --> 30:30.429
WHO CANCELED ORDERS
AND LEFT HATEFUL MESSAGES,

30:30.462 --> 30:32.098
YOU CAN ALL GO
TO HELL TOO.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.365
- ANNETTE, STOP THIS.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.467
- TO THE PRESS
WHO TURNED ON ME,

30:35.501 --> 30:39.972
AND TO THE NYPD
WHO HOUNDED ME MERCILESSLY,

30:40.006 --> 30:42.041
YOU'RE SCUM--
ALL OF YOU!

30:43.575 --> 30:46.078
AND TO MY FAMILY

30:46.112 --> 30:47.613
AT LUSCIOUS GRAPE,

30:47.646 --> 30:51.350
MY LYING, BACKSTABBING,
UNGRATEFUL FAMILY--

30:51.383 --> 30:54.020
YOU'RE ALL FIRED,
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.388
YOU'RE AS LAZY AND AS USELESS
AS THAT BITCH ELLEN WAS,

30:56.422 --> 30:58.557
DRAGGING ME DOWN SO FAR--

30:58.590 --> 31:03.095
THE COMPANY I BUILT
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS.

31:03.129 --> 31:06.065
I JUST WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER ONE THING.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.501
YOU MADE ME DO THIS.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.569
- ANNETTE, NO!

31:10.602 --> 31:13.072
- [screaming]

31:13.105 --> 31:16.108
[camera shutters clicking]

31:23.115 --> 31:25.051
- ANNETTE'S FINAL ACT
AS A BULLY.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.919
SHE FEIGNS CONTRITION
TO DRAW IN HER VICTIMS,

31:26.953 --> 31:29.688
AND THEN SHE TRAUMATIZES THEM
BY SAYING,

31:29.721 --> 31:31.057
"YOU MADE ME DO THIS."

31:31.090 --> 31:32.224
- IT WORKED.

31:32.258 --> 31:35.461
SHE SHOCKED HER EMPLOYEES,
AND LOTS OF PRESS THERE TOO.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.463
- WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU MIX
A SOCIOPATH AND A NARCISSIST--

31:37.496 --> 31:38.931
A TICKING TIME BOMB.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.233
- SO HARDWICKE SAYS
SHE WILL TAKE THE RANT

31:41.267 --> 31:44.971
ABOUT "THAT BITCH ELLEN" AS
ANNETTE'S CONFESSION TO MURDER.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.973
- ANY WORD
ABOUT THE FATE OF THE COMPANY?

31:47.006 --> 31:48.707
- YES. ANNETTE'S ATTORNEY
HAS PETITIONED A JUDGE

31:48.740 --> 31:50.476
ON BEHALF OF HER ESTATE.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.212
SHE'S LEAVING EVERY PENNY
TO HER POOCH.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.448
- SO NOTHING
FOR THE LOYAL EMPLOYEES.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.284
A FINAL "SCREW YOU."

31:58.317 --> 32:00.452
- ELLEN'S A.A. PAL BRUCE
IS HAVING A REALLY BAD DAY.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.488
GOT NAILED
BY A HIT-AND-RUN.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.459
- I WAS WALKING ALONG,

32:07.493 --> 32:10.729
TRYING TO GET THAT
HORRIBLE IMAGE OF ANNETTE

32:10.762 --> 32:13.332
OUT OF MY HEAD.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.566
I DIDN'T LOOK
WHEN I CROSSED THE STREET,

32:14.600 --> 32:15.968
AND WHAM.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.536
- YEAH, THE LADY
WHO CALLED 911--

32:17.569 --> 32:19.171
SHE HEARD THE HIT.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.707
SHE EXPECTED TO FIND YOU
IN TWO PIECES WHEN SHE RAN OUT.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.310
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
- DID YOU SEE THE CAR?

32:24.343 --> 32:27.446
- GOT HIT, BLACKED OUT,
WOKE UP HERE.

32:27.479 --> 32:30.249
- THE WOMAN WHO FOUND YOU
SAID THE CAR NEVER STOPPED.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.485
- IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT.
- WELL...

32:33.519 --> 32:35.521
HIT-AND-RUN IS A FELONY,
SO WE'RE CANVASSING THE AREA.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.656
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.394
SECURITY CAM AT THE BODEGA
ON THE CORNER

32:42.428 --> 32:44.530
BROUGHT US
THIS LITTLE THRILLER.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.498
NOW, BRUCE WAS WALKING
DOWN THE STREET,

32:46.532 --> 32:49.168
UP PULLS A CHEVY--
CHECK THIS OUT.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.537
- FOR SOMEONE WHO SAYS
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HIT HIM,

32:51.570 --> 32:53.239
HE SURE IS FRIENDLY
WITH THAT DRIVER.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.545
- OH, THAT CAR'S
GONNA RUN HIM DOWN.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.550
- THAT WAS NO ACCIDENT.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.385
- SO WHY'D BRUCE LIE
ABOUT IT?

33:06.418 --> 33:08.987
- YOU BETTER ASK THE DRIVER.

33:12.391 --> 33:15.294
- DONALD FIELDING?
- WHO'S ASKING?

33:15.327 --> 33:16.395
- NYPD.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.597
- OH, THAT WAS QUICK.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.667
AIN'T EVEN CALLED
THE INSURANCE COMPANY YET.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.403
- REALLY? WE HEARD YOU WERE
IN QUITE A HURRY TO GET HOME.

33:24.436 --> 33:27.473
- HOME? I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
IN TWO DAYS.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.476
- SO WHO BANGED UP YOUR CAR--
THE DENT FAIRY?

33:30.509 --> 33:33.512
- SOME OLD GEEZER
BACKED INTO IT.

33:33.545 --> 33:34.446
- HERE ON THE STREET?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.515
- NAH, AT THE PARKING LOT
AT THE STORE.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.484
- OKAY, I'M NOW
OFFICIALLY CONFUSED.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.219
- I DON'T DRIVE NO MORE,
RIGHT?

33:40.252 --> 33:42.154
THE DMV YANKED MY LICENSE.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.456
THIS MORNING, MY GRANDDAUGHTER
BORROWED THE CAR

33:44.490 --> 33:46.125
TO GO TO THE MARKET,

33:46.158 --> 33:48.527
SAID SOME OLD FART
BACKED INTO HER--

33:48.560 --> 33:51.530
GOT SO RATTLED, SHE FORGOT
TO BRING ME MY SMOKES.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.665
- WHAT'S YOUR
GRANDDAUGHTER'S NAME?

33:53.699 --> 33:56.435
- YOU THINK
I RAN OVER BRUCE?

33:56.468 --> 33:57.703
- NO, I THINK
YOU CHATTED HIM UP FIRST,

33:57.736 --> 33:59.271
BUT THAT DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED,

33:59.305 --> 34:00.772
SO YOU WENT AFTER HIM
WITH YOUR GRANDFATHER'S CAR.

34:00.806 --> 34:03.175
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.743
- OKAY.

34:07.546 --> 34:10.316
SO HOW ABOUT NOW?

34:10.349 --> 34:12.251
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.253
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY I AM HERE.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.322
- WE FOUND THE DRIVER
WHO RAN YOU OVER.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.789
WE NEED YOU TO MAKE AN I.D.
RIGHT HERE.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.558
- I TOLD YOU,
I DIDN'T SEE THE CAR.

34:19.591 --> 34:22.794
- OKAY, SO HUMOR US.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.697
- SO I BORROWED MY POPPY'S CAR,
AND I TRACKED BRUCE DOWN,

34:25.731 --> 34:28.467
AND I WAS ALREADY SO ANGRY
THAT WHEN HE BLEW ME OFF,

34:28.500 --> 34:29.835
I JUST LOST IT,

34:29.868 --> 34:32.304
'CAUSE THAT SON OF A BITCH
RUINED EVERYTHING!

34:32.338 --> 34:34.340
- WHAT IS EVERYTHING?
- CORRINE--DON'T!

34:34.373 --> 34:36.508
- BRUCE KILLED ELLEN.
- I DID NOT.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.543
I DID NOT KILL HER!
LET ME IN!

34:37.576 --> 34:38.577
LET ME IN!
- HOLD ON. ALL RIGHT!

34:38.610 --> 34:40.579
- CORRINE,
I DID NOT KILL HER!

34:40.612 --> 34:41.613
- YOU DID SO!

34:41.647 --> 34:43.749
- I TOLD YOU ELLEN WAS DEAD
WHEN I GOT THERE!

34:43.782 --> 34:44.683
- THEN WHO KILLED HER?

34:44.716 --> 34:46.352
- I DON'T KNOW!
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ANNETTE!

34:46.385 --> 34:48.387
- NO. YOU HAD TO BE THE ONE
TO GO TALK TO HER,

34:48.420 --> 34:50.722
AND YOU BOTH STARTED DRINKING,
AND YOU SCREWED EVERYTHING UP!

34:50.756 --> 34:52.158
- I'M SOBER!

34:52.191 --> 34:53.292
- CALM DOWN!
- THAT CRAZY BITCH

34:53.325 --> 34:54.826
TRIED TO RUN ME OVER.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.463
- BECAUSE YOU KILLED ELLEN
AND RUINED OUR ENTIRE PLAN!

34:57.496 --> 34:59.365
- WHOA! WHAT PLAN?

35:02.334 --> 35:04.403
- OUR PLAN TO KEEP ELLEN

35:04.436 --> 35:07.239
FROM REVEALING OUR SECRET
AT WORK.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.106
- ANNETTE'S BULLYING.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.209
- THE BULLYING,
THE BONUSES, AND PAYOUTS

35:10.242 --> 35:12.178
TO KEEP US ALL QUIET.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.646
- YOU ALL HAD A LOT TO LOSE IF
THAT BUYOUT DIDN'T GO THROUGH.

35:14.680 --> 35:15.714
- WE HAD EVERYTHING TO LOSE

35:15.747 --> 35:16.915
IF ANYBODY FOUND OUT
ABOUT ANNETTE--

35:16.948 --> 35:18.317
OUR JOBS, OUR FUTURE.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.751
WITH EVERYTHING
SHE PUT US THROUGH,

35:19.785 --> 35:21.187
WE EARNED
WHAT WAS COMING TO US!

35:21.220 --> 35:22.454
- WELL, YOU WERE ALL VICTIMS,

35:22.488 --> 35:24.490
BUT I THINK ELLEN
GOT IT THE WORST.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.225
- ELLEN WAS LOSING HER MIND.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.160
SHE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE WEAKER
THAN THE REST OF US,

35:28.194 --> 35:29.495
BUT SHE WAS REALLY
COMING UNGLUED.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.163
- ONE DAY I HEARD HER
AT HER DESK

35:31.197 --> 35:33.265
MUMBLING ABOUT SHOWING
THE WORLD THE TRUTH

35:33.299 --> 35:34.400
AND HOW,
ONCE HER PROOF GOT OUT,

35:34.433 --> 35:35.634
ANNETTE WOULD GET
WHAT SHE DESERVED.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.269
SO I WENT INTO THE BREAK ROOM
AT LUNCH,

35:37.303 --> 35:39.305
AND I TOLD THE OTHERS.
- WHO ARE THE OTHERS?

35:39.338 --> 35:40.839
- ME, JUSTIN, DAVID.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.275
- NOT ANNETTE.
- HELL, NO.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.244
ANNETTE WAS THE ENEMY.

35:45.277 --> 35:48.214
SHE NEVER EVEN KNEW
ABOUT THE TAPES.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.416
- YOU ALL KILLED ELLEN...

35:50.449 --> 35:51.950
WITH YOUR GREED.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.320
YOUR FRIEND NEEDED YOU,
AND YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON HER.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.288
- WE JUST WANTED HER
TO SHUT UP,

35:56.322 --> 35:57.556
JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER!

35:57.589 --> 35:59.691
WE--WE WERE EVEN WILLING
TO GIVE HER

35:59.725 --> 36:01.260
PART OF OUR SHARE
OF THE BUYOUT!

36:01.293 --> 36:02.428
HE SAID THAT
HE WOULD TALK TO HER.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.595
HE SAID HE COULD GET
THROUGH TO HER.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.197
WE NEVER THOUGHT
THAT HE WOULD KILL HER!

36:05.231 --> 36:06.932
- I DIDN'T KILL HER!
SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD!

36:06.965 --> 36:07.866
- BUT YOU STILL KNEW

36:07.899 --> 36:09.901
THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT FIND
THAT FLASH DRIVE,

36:09.935 --> 36:11.970
SO YOU BROKE BACK IN.
- THAT WAS DAVID.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.939
AND HE COULDN'T FIND THE TAPES.
IT WAS TOO LATE ANYWAY.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.342
ELLEN HAD ALREADY SENT THEM
TO THE TV STATION.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.844
- I MIGHT HAVE CONSPIRED
AGAINST HER,

36:18.877 --> 36:21.547
BUT I NEVER HURT MY FRIEND.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.620
- WE JUST WANTED TO BE RICH.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.992
- WHAT A CLUSTER.
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

36:34.025 --> 36:36.428
DID ANNETTE KILL ELLEN,
OR WAS THIS A DRUNKEN ACCIDENT?

36:36.462 --> 36:38.330
- IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

36:38.364 --> 36:41.333
YOUR VICTIM WAS INTOXICATED,
BUT SOMEONE ELSE GOT HER DRUNK.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.469
CSU FINALLY PIECED TOGETHER

36:43.502 --> 36:46.238
THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE
THAT WAS IN ELLEN'S APARTMENT.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.340
- WELL, IF SHE
DIDN'T DRINK WILLINGLY,

36:48.374 --> 36:49.975
WHAT DID THE PERP DO,
RAM IT DOWN HER THROAT?

36:50.008 --> 36:52.278
- I FOUND NO ALCOHOL
IN HER STOMACH.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.246
- HER B.A.C. WAS 1.6.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.982
- I'M SAYING HE DIDN'T RAM IT
DOWN HER THROAT.

36:59.485 --> 37:00.919
- YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.621
- I NEVER FOUND
ANY FINGERPRINTS,

37:02.654 --> 37:06.024
BUT I HADN'T LOOKED AT THE RIM
OF THE BOTTLE FOR CELLS.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.994
I FOUND THESE
ON THE LIP OF THE BOTTLE.

37:09.027 --> 37:12.931
THESE ARE CRYPTS OF MORGAGNI,
ONLY FOUND IN THE ANUS.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.634
- IT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS
THE TRAUMA, BUT...

37:15.667 --> 37:17.469
WHY?

37:17.503 --> 37:19.004
- IT'S AN OLD
ALCOHOLIC'S TRICK.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.372
YOU GET DRUNK FASTER

37:20.406 --> 37:22.007
BECAUSE THE ALCOHOL
BYPASSES THE STOMACH

37:22.040 --> 37:24.310
AND IS ABSORBED DIRECTLY
INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.

37:24.343 --> 37:28.514
THERE ARE REPORTS OF YOUNG GIRLS
SATURATING TAMPONS WITH VODKA.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.049
GETS 'EM LOADED, BUT KEEPS
THEIR BREATH SMELLING SWEET.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.519
- FILE UNDER
"THINGS I NEVER WANTED TO KNOW."

37:33.552 --> 37:36.688
- I BET I KNOW
SOMEONE WHO WOULD.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.624
- I BROUGHT A BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE TO ELLEN, SO...

37:38.657 --> 37:41.627
I HATE TO TELL YOU, BUT THOSE
AREN'T HARD TO COME BY.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.629
I SELL WINE
FOR A LIVING, REMEMBER?

37:43.662 --> 37:46.064
- EXCEPT IT WASN'T A BRAND
THAT WAS SOLD BY LUSCIOUS GRAPE.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.634
BUT IT WAS SOLD...
AT A LIQUOR STORE

37:48.667 --> 37:51.036
RIGHT DOWN THE STREET
FROM ELLEN SAZELIN'S APARTMENT.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.103
- WHY WOULD I BUY
ANYTHING THERE?

37:52.137 --> 37:54.640
- SO YOUR COMPANY INVENTORY
WOULDN'T GET DINGED

37:54.673 --> 37:56.808
AND NONE OF YOUR CO-CONSPIRATORS
WOULD KNOW

37:56.842 --> 37:58.810
YOU WEREN'T FOLLOWING THE PLAN.
- CO-CONSPIRATORS?

37:58.844 --> 38:02.047
- CORRINE, DAVID, BRUCE.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.450
WE HAVE
THEIR SWORN STATEMENTS,

38:04.483 --> 38:07.419
WHICH PUTS YOU ON THE HOOK
FOR ELLEN'S MURDER.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.755
- [chuckles]
THIS IS CRAZY.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.724
- JUSTIN!
MOTHER NEEDS MORE JUICE!

38:12.758 --> 38:14.360
- COMING!

38:14.393 --> 38:16.328
- ACTUALLY,
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

38:16.362 --> 38:17.929
YOU STOOD TO LOSE MILLIONS

38:17.963 --> 38:19.898
IF ELLEN BLEW THE WHISTLE
ON ANNETTE'S BULLYING.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.733
- THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS
EVERYONE AGREED

38:21.767 --> 38:23.902
THAT BRUCE SHOULD BE THE ONE
TO TRY AND SHUT HER UP.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.437
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SAYING,
"REALLY? BRUCE?

38:25.471 --> 38:26.538
THE COMPANY FRUIT?"

38:26.572 --> 38:27.973
- HE'S NOT THE GUY
FOR THE JOB.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.008
- SHE NEEDED SOMEBODY BIGGER,
SOMEBODY BETTER,

38:30.041 --> 38:31.943
SOMEBODY WHO COULD
REALLY ROCK HER WORLD.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.546
- LIKE A STUD WHO KNEW HOW
TO CLOSE A DEAL WITH A WOMAN.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.349
- YOU THINK BRUCE
KNOWS HOW TO CLOSE A DEAL, HMM?

38:37.383 --> 38:39.351
OR THAT TOAD DAVID?

38:39.385 --> 38:40.752
- SO YOU WENT OVER
TO ELLEN'S PLACE

38:40.786 --> 38:43.355
BEFORE BRUCE COULD GET THERE.
- SHE WAS PATHETIC.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.891
CRYING ABOUT HOW ANNETTE
WAS HURTFUL

38:45.924 --> 38:47.426
AND SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.727
- THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN A WEEPY WOMAN.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.128
- RIGHT? I MEAN,
GET OVER IT, BITCH!

38:50.161 --> 38:52.431
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE WORTH
A FORTUNE!

38:52.464 --> 38:54.132
SO I TRIED TO GIVE HER
SOME CHAMPAGNE.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.368
AND SHE SAID NO,
THAT SHE WAS SOBER.

38:56.402 --> 38:57.869
- AND YOU DON'T STRIKE ME
AS THE TYPE

38:57.903 --> 38:59.137
TO TAKE "NO" FOR AN ANSWER,

38:59.170 --> 39:01.039
SO THAT'S WHEN
YOU LEANED IN AND KISSED HER...

39:01.072 --> 39:03.909
- YEAH! AND SHE--
SH--SHE--

39:03.942 --> 39:05.777
- SHE REJECTED YOU.

39:05.811 --> 39:08.580
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT--
A WOMAN LIKE THAT?

39:08.614 --> 39:10.382
PROBABLY NEVER BEEN LAID
IN HER LIFE.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.150
SO I-I TRIED AGAIN,
AND SHE SLAPPED ME.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.152
- AND THAT'S WHEN YOU
ATTACKED HER.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.788
- NO! I JUST PUSHED HER,
NOT EVEN HARD.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.990
AND SHE FELL BACK AGAINST
THE COFFEE TABLE,

39:19.024 --> 39:21.159
AND A VASE BROKE,

39:21.192 --> 39:24.396
AND I SAID, "GOD, I'M SO SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY."

39:24.430 --> 39:27.766
AND I LEANED DOWN
TO HELP HER UP, AND...

39:27.799 --> 39:30.802
THAT'S WHEN I SAW
THE--THE GLASS IN HER NECK.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.474
THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD.

39:35.507 --> 39:38.644
- WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL 911?
- I FREAKED OUT.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.781
I JUST THOUGHT I HAD TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT,

39:42.814 --> 39:44.483
YOU KNOW?

39:46.217 --> 39:48.920
LIKE SHE WAS DRUNK
OFF HER ASS.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.589
- JUSTIN JENNINGS...

39:50.622 --> 39:53.158
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
THE MURDER OF ELLEN SAZELIN.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.629
- HOW'D YOU KNOW IT WAS ME?

39:57.663 --> 39:59.498
- YOUR MOTHER
WAS AN OPERA SINGER,

39:59.531 --> 40:02.067
NEEDED TO SAVE
THOSE VOCAL CHORDS, SO...

40:02.100 --> 40:04.803
SHE DOWNED HER BOOZE
THROUGH THE BACK DOOR.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.137
- JUSTIN!

40:06.171 --> 40:08.440
WHERE ARE YOU?

40:08.474 --> 40:09.908
I NEED YOU.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.181
- MOTHER'S VERY CLEVER...

40:16.214 --> 40:20.452
TAUGHT ME A LOT OF THINGS.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.821
- JUSTIN.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.490
JUSTIN?

40:24.523 --> 40:26.692
JUSTIN!
