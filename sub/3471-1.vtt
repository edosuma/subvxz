00:19.720 --> 00:23.489
<i>There is another world.</i>

00:28.462 --> 00:33.232
<i>I have seen it... in
the magic mirror.</i>

00:38.105 --> 00:41.673
<i>An inverse of our own.</i>

00:44.078 --> 00:47.880
<i>A dark place.</i>

00:48.882 --> 00:53.619
<i>Where greed, and
corruption thrive.</I></i>

00:53.621 --> 00:55.989
<I>It must be kept hidden.</I>

00:58.092 --> 01:02.027
<I>If the wrong forces
discover this world.</I>

01:04.765 --> 01:07.233
<i>It would mean War.</i>

01:16.310 --> 01:19.645
Mirror? Mirror?
Where is the king?

01:19.647 --> 01:22.181
<I>Is he leading the
defense of the castle?</I>

01:22.183 --> 01:24.483
Lord! They are
through the gate!

01:24.485 --> 01:26.652
<I>Why has our army
turned against us!</I>

01:26.654 --> 01:29.354
<I>Who is leading this rebellion?</I>

01:29.356 --> 01:31.924
Snow!

01:32.359 --> 01:34.226
Snow!

01:35.129 --> 01:37.864
Rumpelstiltskin!

01:38.699 --> 01:42.601
I should have known it was you who
brought this darkness upon us.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.874
I will not move if I were you.

01:49.176 --> 01:54.814
How dare you corrupt members of my
Royal guard with your black arts?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.716
You realize you have
angered all of the kingdoms

01:57.718 --> 02:00.385
of this land with your
pointless War.

02:00.387 --> 02:05.625
- Even as, we speak the others are coming.
- Princesses?

02:06.527 --> 02:10.562
Even if you managed to
kill me, they will stop you.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.197
Kill you!

02:12.199 --> 02:14.533
I need you.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.205
I am here with a deal.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.374
Where is the King?

02:24.378 --> 02:30.215
I will leave this squalid little
pile of cobblestones you call

02:30.317 --> 02:33.920
a kingdom if you do
something for me.

02:34.722 --> 02:38.624
Where is The King?

02:40.728 --> 02:45.931
This mirror can be used as a
gateway to another world.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.067
A world without magic.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.371
A place where I could
live like a God.

02:52.473 --> 02:57.877
Send me there and I will
take my men and leave.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.580
What do you say?

03:01.282 --> 03:03.850
Where is my husband?

03:07.421 --> 03:11.556
Snow White. Fairest
in all the land.

03:11.558 --> 03:14.259
All that power, and
what do you do with it?

03:14.261 --> 03:16.662
I protect it.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.164
Not very well.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.611
You killed him!

03:32.613 --> 03:40.384
I had to. I knew you would not listen,
unless I stack the deck in my favor.

03:40.587 --> 03:43.856
There is power in
the King's death.

03:44.658 --> 03:50.329
As it happens, enough to make your
army mine in a single stroke.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.801
Of all the times, we
have done this...

03:55.803 --> 03:58.004
your choice has never
been easier.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.975
Open the Portal and you will
never see me or my army again.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.712
Refuse and you will die.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.793
You will never get a
better deal than that.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.987
An entire world with no magic.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.562
We have a deal!

05:00.000 --> 05:03.068
If you kill me, The Wolf will
kill you.

05:03.070 --> 05:06.638
No life is worth a kingdom.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.031
Are we too late?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.900
This way, come on.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.136
There is nobody here.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.174
No, look! It is the King!

05:45.412 --> 05:46.979
Dear Lord!

05:51.585 --> 05:52.819
The magic mirror.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.858
If the Queen has gone through then
our only choice is to follow her.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.798
- You missed one.
- I could kill him.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.034
Alternatively, he
could kill you.

06:10.103 --> 06:15.507
The Wolf is here. Trust me you let your guard
down like that again, and he will kill you.

06:15.509 --> 06:18.911
- Princess Powers or not.
- It is such a beautiful chamber.

06:21.114 --> 06:24.783
Red waits. We can
help each other.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.451
This affects all of us.

06:26.453 --> 06:29.821
I am here for one reason,
to kill The Wolf.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.891
I got you this far. Your
little mission is just that.

06:33.380 --> 06:34.280
Yours.

06:34.428 --> 06:38.664
Time moves swiftly on the other side. The
longer we linger the more time has gone.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.966
Well then, we should hurry.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.503
You think your home, was the only
thing destroyed by this War?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.371
We have lost Kingdoms.

06:46.373 --> 06:50.642
I was busy fighting thralls. While you
are marrying into the life of luxury.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.178
Do not lecture me about War.

06:53.680 --> 06:58.649
Do not you understand? If we kill Rumpelstiltskin,
all his thralls will be released.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.153
However, the Wolf
will go free.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.225
Royals. You brought
this on yourselves.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.898
How do we find the Queen?

07:14.735 --> 07:16.369
Ask the mirror!

07:17.471 --> 07:19.706
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.978
Show us Snow White.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.782
What now?

07:31.084 --> 07:35.086
Dead or alive we find the Queen,
wherever she is and we follow her.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.523
Rescue her if we have to...

07:37.925 --> 07:41.494
Then we kill Rumpelstiltskin
and, we end this mess.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.130
We have to be prepared
for anything.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.766
- Brave little Piggies.
- Red!

07:48.168 --> 07:50.201
Step away from the mirror
or she dies.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.937
You will kill her either way!

08:07.955 --> 08:10.055
Jesus! Fuck!

08:13.060 --> 08:14.993
Look! I do not want any
problems. Okay people.

08:15.403 --> 08:17.570
- Listen! Officers.
- What do you think, Laguardia?

08:17.764 --> 08:20.231
You think anyone would miss
old Jack here if we...

08:20.233 --> 08:22.534
signed him up for the Mayor's
new softball team?

08:23.236 --> 08:26.504
That is not funny, Ernst. Remember
I helped you with that thing!

08:26.812 --> 08:27.747
- Relax!
- I got kid!

08:27.843 --> 08:31.076
Relax! I am messing with you.

08:31.778 --> 08:35.847
I am not going to send you into the
Mayor's good squad. However...

08:36.950 --> 08:40.785
His honor will be none too happy if he finds
out you have been talking to her again.

08:41.087 --> 08:46.025
- Her? Who? I... Who?
- Snow White!

08:57.070 --> 08:58.337
Red! Wait!

08:58.919 --> 09:01.686
This is car 2-7! We got a possible
213 at First and Fremont.

09:02.091 --> 09:04.927
<I>Requesting backup.
They came out of nowhere!

09:11.618 --> 09:14.186
Ladies! Get down
on the ground.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.024
He is wearing a shield
as a sigil.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.559
Perhaps they are knights.

09:21.261 --> 09:25.664
- I do not think so.
- I will talk to the peasant-folk.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.900
Hello!

09:31.271 --> 09:34.739
- Maybe you can help us.
- I am not going to ask you again.

09:34.941 --> 09:38.543
Get down on the ground with your
hands behind your head. Now!

09:38.945 --> 09:43.482
My, no. We are looking
for our Queen.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.950
Snow White.

09:45.852 --> 09:46.886
That is it!

09:49.690 --> 09:50.590
For me?

09:52.225 --> 09:53.525
You should not have.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.594
That was dreadful.

09:56.296 --> 10:00.632
Hey Ladies! Thanks.
So, whatever.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.233
However, you got to
get out of here.

10:02.335 --> 10:05.370
See, in this town, that sound
means trouble.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.538
Do you know where we
can find Snow White?

10:07.840 --> 10:08.740
Snow?

10:10.177 --> 10:11.411
She finds you.

10:20.921 --> 10:21.821
Get in.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.265
What took you so long?

10:33.867 --> 10:38.103
Thralls still hold the castle. They have
infiltrated every inch of the Kingdom and beyond.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.838
The mirror is broken.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.940
However, a piece of it did
come through with us.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.108
Where is it?

10:43.710 --> 10:45.476
Red Hood has it.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.913
- Commoner.
- Ally.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.582
The Wolf came through as well.
She is after him now.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.019
All she cares about is killing
The Wolf, nothing more.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.521
She cannot be trusted.

10:56.723 --> 11:00.425
We have to find Red and the mirror before
The Wolf leads her to Rumpelstiltskin.

11:01.127 --> 11:04.094
If that bastard gets his hands on it,
he will open the Portal again...

11:04.096 --> 11:05.230
and bring his army through.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.420
Red would not let that happen,
your Highness.

11:07.539 --> 11:09.307
I am not Queen
of anything anymore.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.175
How long has it been?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.445
Too long.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.061
<i>What is that entire racket?</i>

12:09.863 --> 12:12.664
Holy shit...

12:16.036 --> 12:17.536
You got a death wish.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.622
Who you are working for little
girl. Where are mommy and daddy?

12:25.034 --> 12:25.934
I did not do this.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.017
Well then, you will not mind waiting
around to explain it to Iron John.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.354
He keeps the order
around here.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.791
Something tells me, I do not think he is going
to kindly to you messing with the boys.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.662
Tearing up his favorite
establishment.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.399
Is this everyone?

12:49.336 --> 12:50.503
It is plenty.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.805
The entire better.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.411
Somebody call John!

14:32.172 --> 14:33.939
That is City Hall.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.442
He wanted to invade and
live like a King.

14:37.444 --> 14:44.148
However, without his army, he forced to worm
his way into the local power structure.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.251
Here he is Mayor.

14:46.953 --> 14:51.990
He has corrupted this city at
every level-bankrupted it

14:52.673 --> 14:55.875
building his secure Penthouse
on the top floor.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.997
He keeps the building
staffed with security.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.733
He even has his own
private SWAT team.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.036
He rarely leaves
in the Penthouse.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.674
If there is a way up, I
have not found it yet.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.118
Mayor wanted to see us.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.555
Just a moment!

15:24.057 --> 15:27.558
Your Honor, Officers Ernst and
Laguardia are here for you.

15:29.996 --> 15:30.896
Right away.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.771
Right this way, officers.
Mayor Heart will see you now.

15:52.085 --> 15:55.721
Officers Ernst and Laguardia
are here for you, Sir.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.590
Of course!

15:59.692 --> 16:03.495
Boys! Come in. Come in!

16:06.366 --> 16:07.332
Thank you, Jessica.

16:08.034 --> 16:12.071
Why do not you head home
for the evening?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.442
Forget what you saw here.

16:23.750 --> 16:28.887
You boys are supposed to be
out rounding up new recruits.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.121
What happened?

16:31.062 --> 16:34.598
- Well! Your Honor it is...
- They said they were looking for Snow White.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.363
Who said they were looking
for Snow White?

16:39.365 --> 16:43.168
There were three of them,
female, talked kind of funny.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.937
Where are they?

16:48.241 --> 16:51.543
Escaped... Your Honor.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.045
It was as if they were magic.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.382
It is as if they were magic.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.584
Magic!

17:15.135 --> 17:18.971
Are you a family man, Ernst?

17:20.772 --> 17:23.509
Wife, sir.

17:26.412 --> 17:27.945
I tell you what...

17:28.648 --> 17:31.082
I am going to make you a deal.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.986
Find the Princesses.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.822
Find Snow White.

17:38.124 --> 17:42.327
And bring them back here so that they
do not ruin my plans for this city.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.964
You do that...

17:47.367 --> 17:52.237
And, I will not send you home
to your wife... like that.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.851
Now you go to do your job!

18:08.821 --> 18:10.588
Putting him with the others.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.791
Go! Now!

18:18.722 --> 18:21.457
By the time, I knew what
he was doing, it was too late.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.502
He controls everything.

18:24.571 --> 18:25.837
Police.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.640
Emergency systems.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.043
Press.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.980
He never had this much
power before.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.484
People here are helpless
against him.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.892
<i>He started with the police.</i>

18:48.194 --> 18:51.997
<i>Turned them into his own
private task force.</i>

18:53.199 --> 18:55.902
<i>They are even more criminal
than cop.</i>

18:57.704 --> 19:03.774
<i>Or... they conveniently
disappear.</i>

19:09.515 --> 19:10.849
Sorry friend.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.891
<i>They are taking people
one by one,</i>

19:20.193 --> 19:23.728
<i>turning them into
thralls for a new army.</i>

19:29.152 --> 19:31.656
Be quiet. Be quiet.

19:31.904 --> 19:37.075
<i>Those who oppose him risk more
than simple servitude.</i>

19:40.647 --> 19:42.648
<i>The mirror complicates things.</i>

19:44.317 --> 19:47.719
<i>Hopefully your friend Red
understands what she has.</i>

19:48.621 --> 19:53.522
<i>If Rumpelstiltskin get to it
before we do, there is nothing...</i>

19:53.946 --> 19:57.583
<i>to stop him from attacking the
city with the entire Royal army.</i>

19:58.112 --> 20:01.682
Find whoever did this! Find
her and bring her to me, now!

20:02.435 --> 20:06.304
You heard John! You do not come back
with the girl, you do not come back!

20:15.481 --> 20:16.948
I have another one for you.

20:19.852 --> 20:20.953
Your Honor!

20:38.538 --> 20:40.771
<i>He is hiding in plain sight
for now.</i>

20:46.479 --> 20:50.615
<i>Storing his new army in
pockets all over the city.</i>

20:56.322 --> 21:02.093
<i>When he is ready...
He will attack.</i>

21:05.198 --> 21:09.000
If that happens, we will never
be able to get close to him.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.735
If the mirror fragments can
re-open the Portal,

21:12.423 --> 21:13.903
that means we can go
back home, right?

21:14.006 --> 21:18.844
We can worry about getting home after
we take care of Rumpelstiltskin.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.116
We need to find Red
before he does.

21:38.888 --> 21:44.224
He said, he said tell her
I am waiting.

21:46.863 --> 21:47.866
Off the grandma's house.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.135
Here boy!

22:35.588 --> 22:37.789
Here boy!

22:38.591 --> 22:42.860
<i>- You have something I want.</i>
- Come and get it.

22:46.098 --> 22:49.600
<i>You reek of fear. Give
me the mirror fragment.</i>

22:49.602 --> 22:52.503
I promise I will
kill you quickly.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.073
Like you killed my family.

22:55.575 --> 22:58.977
If I let you go, their deaths
are meaningless.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.245
All death is meaningless.

23:01.801 --> 23:03.268
Not yours!

23:09.455 --> 23:11.822
There she is.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.726
What are you doing down
here by yourself?

23:15.595 --> 23:17.363
Do you like jewelry?

23:18.965 --> 23:22.633
Put them on or we shoot,
right now.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.237
Iron John wants
to talk to you.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.344
Okay, first up...

23:33.646 --> 23:35.747
We need to blend in.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.650
The last thing we want is to
draw attention.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.954
If they find us, it is over.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.125
Can you manage that?

23:49.562 --> 23:50.528
No problem.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.631
Find the Jack. Find the Jack. Come
on, sir. You can find the Jack.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.366
Where is he? Are you ready?

23:55.568 --> 23:59.303
This one? Are you sure? This is the one you
want? The center one? All right, here we go.

23:59.555 --> 24:02.890
That is the Queen, that is
not it. That is not the one.

24:03.427 --> 24:07.229
- My mommy is going to kill me.
- This is the poor man's Vegas. You can get rich playing

24:07.641 --> 24:11.043
the poor man's Vegas. It is a magical moment.
I can feel it. I can feel it in the air.

24:11.870 --> 24:13.004
Come on Snow.

24:14.153 --> 24:17.121
- Hi, Jack.
- I do not want any trouble, all right!

24:17.484 --> 24:18.564
I told you last time, Snow.

24:18.973 --> 24:20.407
I do not want any
problems with the Mayor.

24:20.526 --> 24:23.060
Just want to know what you
have been hearing, Jack.

24:23.588 --> 24:24.748
That is what you said before.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.966
I do not know, okay.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.036
Look! Maybe...

24:33.385 --> 24:34.487
Maybe I heard about a bar.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.942
I got tore up
last night, okay.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.710
You see how is easy.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.646
You did not hear
that from me. Okay?

24:53.726 --> 24:55.259
Why would she come here?

24:55.704 --> 24:59.341
- Are you surprised?
- Hey, pay attention.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.311
Hey.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.615
I heard you got a
story to tell.

25:19.819 --> 25:23.521
Last, I heard,
Iron John has her.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.523
However, she-she did not
kill those men.

25:27.026 --> 25:31.530
No. It was he. It was he. It was he.
It was he. It was he. It was he.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.332
The person who cut my neck.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.770
Scariest damn thing
ever happen to me.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.111
Thanks for sharing.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.813
Could I get you
anything else?

25:53.085 --> 25:54.318
How about a kiss?

26:00.960 --> 26:04.863
If Iron John has her, I know
where she is.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.231
Maybe we are not too late.

26:16.252 --> 26:17.153
Hey John!

26:19.311 --> 26:21.145
A present for you.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.553
Well it is about time.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.234
Who did that to you?

26:44.336 --> 26:45.270
My boys?

26:52.912 --> 26:54.212
Explain.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.082
It has called an arrow.

26:59.485 --> 27:04.322
This was sticking out of the
back of my favorite bar.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.590
Why?

27:06.892 --> 27:09.059
I missed.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.827
Did you miss whom?

27:11.293 --> 27:13.494
The guy who really
killed your men.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.401
I am a man who
appreciates order.

27:17.403 --> 27:21.338
You upset that order, we got
cops sniffing around here.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.040
That would be bad.

27:23.042 --> 27:26.410
You say you did not do it,
prove it, who did?

27:26.412 --> 27:31.114
It is a monster in the skin of a
man. And, the longer you keep

27:31.464 --> 27:35.266
me here, the more of your
men he will kill.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.361
Anything else?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.130
Yeah.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.697
I am going to kill him.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.071
How are you going to do that?

28:04.116 --> 28:05.750
Like this.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.391
Open fire!

28:15.666 --> 28:16.566
Fire.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.791
Where is she?

28:47.793 --> 28:51.228
There she is! Go! Get her!
Go, go, and go!

28:51.363 --> 28:53.231
Freeze!

28:55.801 --> 28:58.369
You are under arrest!
All of you!

29:03.765 --> 29:06.733
<i>She is not Princess, but she might
be useful as a bargaining chip.</i>

29:07.625 --> 29:10.360
Yeah. All right!

29:11.632 --> 29:13.065
Keep her there,
until I arrive.

29:13.867 --> 29:15.101
Sir...

29:15.811 --> 29:16.711
Stay back.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.191
My God!

29:24.436 --> 29:26.036
- Should I call security, sir?
- No.

29:27.291 --> 29:28.659
Would not matter if you did.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.034
It is good to see
you my friend.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.770
I did not come alone.

29:33.072 --> 29:36.073
Believe me, I know. I was just on
my way to question the Red one.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.410
She has got a piece of the
mirror fragment.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.147
Do not you say?

29:50.856 --> 29:52.523
Your timing could
not be better.

29:52.925 --> 29:56.927
Public office can be so...
boring...

29:56.929 --> 30:00.430
Your Honor... please...
helps...

30:00.432 --> 30:05.970
I am not one for subtly.
I prefer a grand gesture.

30:06.372 --> 30:07.971
Jessica...

30:08.735 --> 30:12.370
will arrange for a car to take you to
the den. You can do whatever you...

30:12.683 --> 30:14.652
want with your little
Red plaything.

30:16.849 --> 30:19.017
Bring me the mirror.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.087
My army waits.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.708
This is not right.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.476
Look!

30:48.080 --> 30:52.316
Cops never bother Iron John...
Something must be going on.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.684
It is Red.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.987
We do not know that.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.089
We have to be sure.

30:59.291 --> 31:03.994
- They look weak.
- Let us take them.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.863
All right!

31:06.265 --> 31:08.099
You heard the woman.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.947
The place creep me out man.
Come on.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.616
What do you think they are going
to do with Iron John and his boys?

31:26.618 --> 31:28.085
Who cares?

31:32.591 --> 31:34.060
It is cold of a sudden.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.241
Good night!

32:13.665 --> 32:15.433
Where were they guarding?

32:25.577 --> 32:26.811
Hold them back!

32:29.681 --> 32:31.248
Come on it!

32:46.098 --> 32:47.765
This is bad.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.500
He is mobilizing his army.

32:50.928 --> 32:54.964
We have to assume he has the fragment,
and he is preparing an attack.

32:55.511 --> 32:58.246
He probably has stockpiles like
this set up all over this city.

32:58.604 --> 33:01.838
We have to give up searching
for Red. Times up.

33:02.225 --> 33:05.895
If Rumpelstiltskin has the mirror,
why has not he attacked yet?

33:06.418 --> 33:11.021
Because he has not it.
Red does it.

33:11.401 --> 33:12.934
Her again.

33:13.432 --> 33:17.568
You may not think she is worth anything,
but I am not giving up on her yet.

33:17.569 --> 33:19.863
No life is worth a kingdom.

33:20.318 --> 33:24.321
And she has the mirror, what
is her life worth then?

33:25.404 --> 33:28.137
We do not actually
know that she has it.

33:28.505 --> 33:29.405
I saw it.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.743
We still do not even
know where she is.

33:37.483 --> 33:38.983
Let us ask him.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.595
Really messed up, John.

33:53.432 --> 33:56.634
You are making a lot of noise,
you and your men.

33:57.136 --> 34:00.537
The Mayor is a little upset.
You have been squatting on

34:00.977 --> 34:02.744
city property without
coming to pay tribute.

34:03.217 --> 34:04.450
Tribute for what?

34:04.743 --> 34:07.977
My men were working on that site
until the mayor shut us down.

34:08.449 --> 34:09.984
They lost their livelihood!

34:10.114 --> 34:12.216
All I have done to
keep them together.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.485
Someone has got to
keep that order.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.255
It is too late now.

34:21.092 --> 34:23.159
And you, Little Red Bitch...

34:23.672 --> 34:28.842
I got some questions for you. You and
me are going down the hall to the den.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.703
Boys down there
are asking hard.

34:45.617 --> 34:51.688
I did not kill your men, and I did
not kill you when I had the chance.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.331
Oops!

35:02.343 --> 35:05.079
You bitch! Come
back, you bitch!

35:05.904 --> 35:08.271
Come back, you bitch!

35:08.373 --> 35:10.707
You bitch!

35:13.345 --> 35:15.145
He is waking up.

35:15.147 --> 35:16.513
Is he back to normal?

35:16.515 --> 35:17.682
Almost.

35:19.177 --> 35:21.044
Where am I?

35:23.212 --> 35:24.112
What is going on?

35:24.193 --> 35:25.893
We need to have a little talk.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.253
Alternatively, you can go back
in there with them.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.821
- No please.
- Where is Red Riding Hood?

35:31.417 --> 35:33.785
Who? I do not know.
Look! I am just a rookie.

35:34.236 --> 35:35.276
He does not know anything.

35:35.691 --> 35:37.091
Well! He is better
know something.

35:37.750 --> 35:42.586
Look! It was join or die, they put me
with Ernst, so he keeps an eye on me.

35:43.031 --> 35:46.000
I did not know what he was planning,
and then it was too late.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.311
He is taking people.

35:48.213 --> 35:52.116
Vagrants. Runaways. I could not figure
out what he was doing with them.

35:52.910 --> 35:53.810
Now I know.

35:54.672 --> 35:57.040
- He is not who you think he is.
- No kidding.

35:57.104 --> 35:59.404
We have already watched
him ruin one world.

35:59.524 --> 36:02.525
We need to find someone before
the Mayor does.

36:02.527 --> 36:06.129
We have tracked her far.
We have hit a dead end.

36:06.231 --> 36:07.431
The police have her.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.900
There is only one
place she will be.

36:10.802 --> 36:11.936
The den.

36:54.346 --> 36:57.414
- Where is Red Riding Hood?
- I do not know.

36:57.516 --> 37:00.517
What the hell is all that
noise? Shut the hell up!

37:00.619 --> 37:04.621
No. No, no, no, no! Where is
she? Where is she?

37:07.693 --> 37:10.927
Everybody to the den!
<i>Get SWAT there! Now, now!</i>

37:12.331 --> 37:13.732
We have to go, now!

37:21.707 --> 37:22.908
What is happening?

37:24.843 --> 37:26.376
SWAT.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.615
We have got a prisoner on the
loose in the den. Find out.

37:31.817 --> 37:35.319
Lethal force has authorized.
It is your lucky dayboys.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.322
You have to kill me Princess.

37:42.627 --> 37:43.697
Clear!

37:47.499 --> 37:48.466
Contact.

37:57.743 --> 37:58.876
Hold up.

38:03.715 --> 38:04.982
What then?

38:06.852 --> 38:08.188
Shit!

38:13.692 --> 38:16.293
She is not here!
We have to go!

38:31.743 --> 38:34.044
Looks like you found
your Queen.

38:39.384 --> 38:41.318
We cannot let him get this.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.152
Why do not we use
it to go home?

38:43.488 --> 38:45.076
We can bring back
reinforcements.

38:45.077 --> 38:49.999
Let me be very clear about this; We are
not going anywhere until we kill him.

38:50.409 --> 38:52.309
What if it only work one way.

38:52.774 --> 38:56.777
If we leave now and we cannot get
back... this all have been for nothing.

38:57.340 --> 38:59.808
My father has a whole
army back home.

39:00.363 --> 39:03.597
Maybe if we open the Portal,
he can send them through.

39:03.876 --> 39:06.077
If he has an army, why
does not he use it?

39:06.415 --> 39:09.416
Because he is employing
strategy, unlike some.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.902
If we attack him with an army
it might trigger his invasion.

39:13.308 --> 39:15.028
It is probably best to destroy
the fragment.

39:15.424 --> 39:17.658
- Are you kidding?
- If only you do.

39:18.139 --> 39:22.675
If he wants it so badly, why do not you use
it to lure him out, and then kill him?

39:22.725 --> 39:25.926
See, even she does not want to
break it.

39:26.303 --> 39:31.007
We cannot risk it falling into his hands.
We have to keep it from him at all costs.

39:31.372 --> 39:34.975
After he is dead, we will see
if it can get us back.

39:36.475 --> 39:42.078
However, I would expect any one of you to
break it before it gets into his hands.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.641
It is that understood.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.061
I got them!

39:58.990 --> 40:05.461
Good. Stay with them.
I am sending... someone.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.644
Let us go make a deal.

40:22.487 --> 40:24.354
Hello John!

40:26.025 --> 40:26.925
Where are my men?

40:27.412 --> 40:30.414
They are here, and what
happens to them...

40:30.962 --> 40:32.931
that all depends on you.

40:34.699 --> 40:39.803
I think we have
a similar problem.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.206
Snow White.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.278
Do you know her?

40:48.813 --> 40:50.314
She is my problem.

40:51.016 --> 40:54.717
You seem like a man who
appreciates order.

40:54.719 --> 40:59.857
People look up to you. They
respect you. Included myself.

41:00.892 --> 41:05.396
She disrupts that order and
her little Red Hood friend.

41:07.832 --> 41:11.769
Yeah, she is your problem,
is not she?

41:14.626 --> 41:15.860
So, your men...

41:17.943 --> 41:23.680
Agree to help me out with my
problem, and I will let them go.

41:24.142 --> 41:25.142
All of them.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.951
What do I have to do?

41:28.553 --> 41:32.523
Just shake my hand, and
say we have a deal.

41:35.802 --> 41:38.971
There is... one... thing...

41:40.990 --> 41:48.863
I like to seal this kind of pact with
something, something a little more concrete.

41:48.938 --> 41:51.005
What is that name
they call you?

41:51.370 --> 41:53.170
Iron John.

41:54.045 --> 41:57.547
Iron John. I like that.

41:57.549 --> 41:59.349
I can work with that.

42:00.251 --> 42:01.452
Iron John...

42:03.154 --> 42:04.989
Do we have a deal?

42:15.934 --> 42:18.301
John, what is going on?
Talk to me John!

42:21.358 --> 42:22.392
John!

42:24.518 --> 42:25.418
John!

42:30.782 --> 42:31.982
Who is he to you?

42:33.184 --> 42:38.187
When the War broke out. There were only a
couple of us in my village who could fight.

42:38.610 --> 42:41.846
Most of my families were
farmers and hunters.

42:42.127 --> 42:45.263
Obviously, we were not getting
help from the Royals.

42:46.765 --> 42:49.500
When The Wolf came,
he killed everyone.

42:51.036 --> 42:53.704
Everyone but not me.
It was like...

42:55.306 --> 42:59.042
- It was as if he wanted me to watch it.
- That was his mistake.

42:59.144 --> 43:03.146
However, you have to realize you are
better off with us than on your own.

43:03.545 --> 43:07.513
I am not going to wait around for
you and the Queen to play heroes.

43:07.787 --> 43:09.488
None of us is
playing anything.

43:09.998 --> 43:16.169
Rumpelstiltskin locked Rapunzel in a tower
and burnt her kingdom to the ground.

43:16.350 --> 43:20.819
Prior's kingdom has been under
siege since this War began.

43:20.965 --> 43:22.665
No one has been in or out!

43:22.674 --> 43:24.909
I cannot even imagine
what it is like in there.

43:26.304 --> 43:29.840
You know what he did to
Snow White's husband.

43:31.710 --> 43:36.747
And, my husband, he still lives
but he is one of his thralls.

43:37.849 --> 43:40.884
Do you think Royalty
is a luxury?

43:41.686 --> 43:42.853
It is not.

43:44.055 --> 43:46.090
It makes you a target.

43:49.694 --> 43:51.863
We are not heroes.

43:55.848 --> 43:57.382
We are avengers.

44:11.216 --> 44:12.182
John?

44:13.852 --> 44:16.219
How are we supposed to get in?

44:16.808 --> 44:18.375
Why do not you knock?

44:19.924 --> 44:20.958
They are here.

44:27.065 --> 44:29.299
Quick, get the mirror
to the roof!

44:44.415 --> 44:45.549
Round them up!

44:50.358 --> 44:51.759
Not so fast!

44:59.164 --> 45:00.930
Looks like somebody
made a deal.

45:01.016 --> 45:03.016
Take her down!

45:11.109 --> 45:12.976
Come on Red, we have to get
this out of here.

45:13.178 --> 45:14.246
Red?

45:24.289 --> 45:26.590
Go! Get the mirror to safety!

45:27.826 --> 45:29.492
I will hold them off.

45:30.028 --> 45:31.128
Ready?

45:32.497 --> 45:34.263
Aim...

45:34.966 --> 45:35.866
Fire.

45:37.135 --> 45:38.601
We have to go now!

45:39.093 --> 45:40.459
What about Rapunzel?

45:40.966 --> 45:42.367
I said move!

46:16.040 --> 46:17.807
What are you shooting at?

46:20.178 --> 46:21.811
- I do not know.
- Let us go.

46:22.013 --> 46:24.047
- What about the rest of them?
- They are gone.

46:25.016 --> 46:26.916
Get her out of here.

46:57.282 --> 46:58.547
Where is Rapunzel?

46:58.594 --> 46:59.727
Where is the mirror?

47:00.427 --> 47:02.361
What do you want it boy?
Is this what you want?

47:02.710 --> 47:03.610
Red! Throw it!

47:04.100 --> 47:05.766
Yeah? Fetch!

47:08.025 --> 47:08.925
Dammit!

47:17.035 --> 47:18.101
Red, wait!

47:18.303 --> 47:19.703
Leave her. Come on.

48:26.437 --> 48:28.938
Shut up!

48:30.975 --> 48:32.142
I am here to help you.

48:36.447 --> 48:37.347
Stop!

48:42.497 --> 48:43.397
Shut up!

48:59.537 --> 49:01.170
What is this place?

49:01.321 --> 49:03.589
This was my first
home on Earth.

49:04.342 --> 49:05.408
Cozy!

49:06.010 --> 49:07.576
It is nicer than
where I grew up.

49:07.717 --> 49:10.018
Not surprised.

49:10.648 --> 49:12.849
So, what do we do now?

49:14.115 --> 49:16.016
You are staying here to
keep the fragment safe.

49:16.254 --> 49:20.122
- Here? Alone?
- Someone has to stay behind.

49:20.605 --> 49:21.885
What are we doing
about Rapunzel?

49:21.962 --> 49:24.362
Rapunzel did what she did so we
could escape with the mirror.

49:24.490 --> 49:27.010
And what if she tells them where
we are? How to find this place?

49:27.273 --> 49:28.173
She will not.

49:28.303 --> 49:29.590
And, what if he makes her?

49:29.591 --> 49:32.480
He cannot. His powers do not
work on us. You know that.

49:33.271 --> 49:35.939
She will die before
she tells him.

49:36.441 --> 49:39.943
No life is worth a kingdom.
Is that it?

49:40.545 --> 49:41.577
That is it.

49:41.579 --> 49:45.214
We were five a day ago,
and now we are three.

49:45.653 --> 49:49.422
Your friend Red ran off again,
clearly we cannot count on her.

49:49.924 --> 49:54.226
Rapunzel, she could be dead for all us
know. Thanks to her, we have the mirror.

49:54.595 --> 49:57.697
- That is not good enough!
- You do not get to decide!

49:58.093 --> 50:01.360
I have been here too damn long
to waste it on a rescue mission

50:01.773 --> 50:03.375
when we do not even
know where she is.

50:04.102 --> 50:06.969
Time is running out
for all of us.

50:07.071 --> 50:11.640
If we do not kill him now, before
he attacks the city, it is over.

50:12.392 --> 50:17.130
If you think, he is hard to get to now, wait
until the streets are swarming with thralls.

50:17.482 --> 50:22.351
Look! I promise you, we will
do what we can for Rapunzel.

50:22.743 --> 50:27.314
But our first priority, is
killing Rumpelstiltskin!

50:28.392 --> 50:30.660
Nothing else matters.

50:31.162 --> 50:32.696
Then where are we going?

50:34.265 --> 50:36.900
We are going to find a
way into City Hall.

50:52.984 --> 50:55.385
Get the mayor, now!

50:58.789 --> 51:02.326
You can help a lot of people right
now if you just let me kill him.

51:04.771 --> 51:05.703
Mr. Mayor.

51:06.339 --> 51:07.807
Alternatively, you
can kill them.

51:08.537 --> 51:09.437
Kill the Mayor?

51:09.534 --> 51:11.233
Iron John is here for you.

51:11.435 --> 51:14.036
That is how he wins.
Idiots like you.

51:14.338 --> 51:15.338
Okay.

51:17.141 --> 51:20.442
What did he offer you? That you
would let him turn you into this.

51:21.133 --> 51:22.334
Order.

51:22.647 --> 51:24.847
And, you are the biggest idiot
of them all.

51:25.260 --> 51:27.627
All he ever brings is chaos.

51:30.621 --> 51:31.521
John.

51:32.290 --> 51:36.325
- Mr. Mayor. Your Honor, sir. I called you and...
- Jessica?

51:37.349 --> 51:40.484
John is our friend. Remember?

51:42.200 --> 51:43.232
That is right.

51:46.470 --> 51:49.306
Why do not you take the
rest of the day off?

51:50.208 --> 51:51.675
Okay.

51:56.647 --> 51:58.281
Hello Rapunzel.

51:58.683 --> 52:01.916
- Where are the rest of them?
- They left.

52:02.472 --> 52:03.372
She stayed.

52:04.689 --> 52:07.090
One out of five.

52:10.895 --> 52:12.062
Where are they?

52:13.598 --> 52:15.464
Where is the mirror fragment?

52:15.566 --> 52:22.037
You know this could be so much easier, if I
could just turn you into one of my thralls.

52:22.958 --> 52:23.858
Could not?

52:30.181 --> 52:37.886
You think your fair Queen, would give up her
piece of the mirror, in exchange for you?

52:41.425 --> 52:42.792
She would never.

52:47.365 --> 52:49.066
No life is worth a kingdom.

52:50.401 --> 52:53.902
I guess... not even yours.

52:57.575 --> 52:58.475
Now what?

53:00.478 --> 53:03.346
Stay here with her,
until I get her back.

53:31.575 --> 53:33.109
I need that for work.

53:33.929 --> 53:35.062
What is wrong with her?

53:35.465 --> 53:39.134
This is what he does to people. She is
not a thrall but she under his spell.

53:39.784 --> 53:41.516
Okay, I got what I wanted.
Come on.

53:41.663 --> 53:44.765
I should be going. The mayor
does not like when...

53:45.164 --> 53:47.131
- Jessica.
- The mayor would not be happy.

53:47.446 --> 53:49.746
Jessica! Maybe can I cure her?

53:50.219 --> 53:51.286
We do not have time.

53:51.663 --> 53:53.997
Thank you. No thank you.

53:54.877 --> 53:57.678
Jessica. Jessica.
I am trying to help you.

53:58.626 --> 53:59.666
And maybe she can help us.

54:03.212 --> 54:10.385
- No. No. No, no. His honor would not be happy if.
- Come on!

54:10.795 --> 54:14.565
- Wait. Stop. Come on.
- No, no, no!

54:17.888 --> 54:19.022
Jessica?

54:21.792 --> 54:22.692
Jessica?

54:25.199 --> 54:26.567
Snow White.

54:29.834 --> 54:31.834
Are you looking
for your friend?

54:55.393 --> 54:57.726
<i>Sir, what are we looking for?</i>

54:58.028 --> 55:01.064
The mayor had us install
motion sensors down here.

55:02.534 --> 55:05.435
I cannot tell you how many times we
lost that icy bitch in these tunnels.

55:05.882 --> 55:07.349
<i>South quarter looks clear.</i>

55:07.812 --> 55:10.713
You check, she had to have a rat
hole here somewhere. Keep looking.

55:11.060 --> 55:12.695
<i>Copy that. Doubling back.</i>

55:18.997 --> 55:21.132
<i>Sir, what do we do
if we find someone?</i>

55:22.160 --> 55:23.927
I am not taking any
chances here.

55:25.283 --> 55:29.720
If you see one of those
Princesses, you shoot to kill.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.141
Still in one piece.

55:39.049 --> 55:40.249
I knew you would want to wait.

55:40.404 --> 55:41.438
Good boy!

55:48.879 --> 55:51.214
Quite the troublemaker,
Are not you?

55:54.648 --> 55:58.918
Just like those Royal types to throw
us commoners out to the Wolves.

56:01.459 --> 56:05.094
Where... are they?

56:07.932 --> 56:09.565
She will not tell you.

56:15.973 --> 56:17.674
She will not have to.

56:58.549 --> 57:01.417
<I>I will be there in a minute. I
have one more place to check.</I>

57:03.437 --> 57:04.571
Do you hear that Snow?

57:06.108 --> 57:08.678
If you are down here.
You are dead.

57:20.485 --> 57:22.152
<i>I have dispatched
on the line here, over.</i>

57:22.469 --> 57:23.369
What is it?

57:23.473 --> 57:25.973
<i>City Hall is under attack! All
units back to base! I repeat.</i>

57:26.543 --> 57:28.911
<i>City Hall is under attack!
All units back to base!</i>

57:29.323 --> 57:32.692
Do you people hear that? Something is going
on at base, let us move out of here!

57:41.648 --> 57:44.417
Mirror, mirror, where is
Snow White? Is she okay?

57:45.529 --> 57:46.929
What is going on?

58:05.544 --> 58:07.344
Okay. We are not going
to get a better chance.

58:07.730 --> 58:10.532
- That elevator leads up to his office.
- Are you ready for this?

58:10.872 --> 58:13.439
- Absolutely.
- It is now or never! Let us go!

58:13.579 --> 58:19.450
Hello, Security? Hi, this is
Jessica, is his Honor in?

58:21.454 --> 58:24.156
<i>Okay. Thank you, Bye. Bye!</i>

58:27.134 --> 58:29.801
The mayor is not here. In a
minute this place is going to be

58:30.286 --> 58:32.954
swarming with security and you
guys have to get out of here, now.

58:33.409 --> 58:37.745
You will have to come back. That asshole is
going to chance the security codes after this.

58:38.216 --> 58:39.383
However, I can get you in.

58:40.372 --> 58:41.738
I will shut down security.

58:41.753 --> 58:44.287
If he realizes you are helping
us, he will kill you.

58:44.333 --> 58:48.002
He will not realize.
You have to go!

58:48.389 --> 58:51.391
They are coming! I will text
you as soon as he gets back.

58:52.425 --> 58:53.691
Thank you for helping us.

58:54.043 --> 58:59.113
No, thank you. All this time
he has blinded me.

58:59.610 --> 59:00.610
You people are heroes.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.180
Good luck!

59:06.226 --> 59:09.328
Security, they went this way! If
you hurry you can catch them!

59:23.928 --> 59:25.262
It is you.

59:33.814 --> 59:34.714
Try on!

59:39.065 --> 59:39.965
Red!

59:49.138 --> 59:50.105
Where is she?

59:51.437 --> 59:52.337
Gone.

59:53.719 --> 59:54.685
Dammit!

59:59.397 --> 01:00:00.398
What happened?

01:00:01.559 --> 01:00:04.560
I tried to use the mirror to
find you. I am sorry.

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:07.435
Now Red has the mirror
and a Head Start.

01:00:08.277 --> 01:00:09.357
We know where she is going.

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:10.475
City Hall.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.820
This is it.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.009
If we are lucky.

01:00:13.199 --> 01:00:15.267
Today is the day we
avenge our kingdoms.

01:00:17.528 --> 01:00:19.529
Today is the day
we cure our people.

01:00:21.749 --> 01:00:22.849
Today we go home.

01:00:24.944 --> 01:00:26.578
Let us just hope Jessica
can do her part.

01:00:27.008 --> 01:00:28.040
Now let us move.

01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:30.441
We need to be ready as soon as
we hear from her.

01:00:38.105 --> 01:00:40.141
<i>His honor is on site.
Lock down City Hall.</i>

01:00:43.278 --> 01:00:45.611
CONTACT ME AS SOON AS
HE IS BACK - BE CAREFUL

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:48.142
HE IS HERE HURRY

01:01:14.013 --> 01:01:15.113
BUILDING SECURE

01:01:26.193 --> 01:01:27.527
Do you have an appointment?

01:01:29.859 --> 01:01:30.759
Do not!

01:01:34.839 --> 01:01:36.740
<i>Well! Look who is here.</i>

01:01:39.646 --> 01:01:41.480
<i>I am going to enjoy this.</i>

01:01:41.991 --> 01:01:44.559
Head, John, Jessica.

01:01:46.846 --> 01:01:47.746
We get a problem.

01:01:49.948 --> 01:01:52.583
No, Your Honor.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:54.643
I have a problem.

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:56.412
Her.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.114
What is she doing here?

01:02:00.473 --> 01:02:02.208
She is delivering this.

01:02:04.683 --> 01:02:10.154
See, John, everyone ends up
working for me.

01:02:11.058 --> 01:02:13.026
She just tried
to kill your helper.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:13.930
What?

01:02:15.454 --> 01:02:16.622
She just...

01:02:19.077 --> 01:02:20.244
Tried to kill...

01:02:21.283 --> 01:02:22.317
Jessica.

01:02:26.424 --> 01:02:27.592
Jessica.

01:02:31.821 --> 01:02:32.861
Why would you do that?

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.842
You do not question me, John!

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:41.033
We have a deal. Do you want
order? It is my order.

01:02:43.352 --> 01:02:49.924
You and your men can work for me
willingly, or you and your men can die.

01:02:54.724 --> 01:02:55.624
Get downstairs.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:59.370
Now!

01:03:25.439 --> 01:03:28.607
Guard it at, all costs.

01:04:07.879 --> 01:04:10.246
Calling all units. This is
officer Laguardia.

01:04:10.626 --> 01:04:14.829
Anyone who still cares about
this city. Get to City Hall!

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.598
What is going on?

01:04:18.071 --> 01:04:20.689
It gets worse from here. I knew he was
crazy but I never seen anything like this.

01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:24.273
- Watch out!
- Get down!

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:27.496
Put him out!

01:04:33.698 --> 01:04:34.598
I got him.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:42.177
Hit him again!

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:43.945
Do you ready for naptime?

01:04:44.155 --> 01:04:45.488
Just do it.

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:54.022
If we do not act fast, the city
will be crawling with these things.

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:55.290
This is my fault.

01:04:55.698 --> 01:04:57.432
There is only one person
to blame for this.

01:04:59.799 --> 01:05:00.999
It is Rumpelstiltskin.

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:05.424
It has started.

01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:08.989
She will be coming,
along with the others.

01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:10.733
It will not matter.

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:14.912
All we have to do is... wait.

01:05:16.523 --> 01:05:21.859
Hold them off, long enough
for my thralls...

01:05:22.932 --> 01:05:24.100
to tear apart this city.

01:05:28.387 --> 01:05:30.421
John! Are you sure about this?

01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:35.530
I mean, I have never been called
a saint, but this seems wrong.

01:05:39.246 --> 01:05:46.050
There is an entire police force, and my
army of thralls between us and them.

01:05:48.563 --> 01:05:52.033
They will send the national
guard, the military.

01:05:53.936 --> 01:05:56.504
All to rescue Mayor Heart.

01:05:56.936 --> 01:06:00.639
And one by one, I will take
control of them all.

01:06:03.791 --> 01:06:07.159
Secure the lobby.
No one gets through.

01:06:16.705 --> 01:06:20.508
Why do not you head outside?

01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:23.316
And when you see
your friends...

01:06:24.994 --> 01:06:26.428
kill as many as you can.

01:06:39.687 --> 01:06:40.687
Finally.

01:06:52.261 --> 01:06:53.627
It has begun.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.901
All right! Laguardia and his men
are buying us enough time to get

01:07:30.062 --> 01:07:31.622
into the lobby before
they shut it down.

01:07:31.764 --> 01:07:34.365
We have to find the elevator
that leads up to the Penthouse.

01:07:34.681 --> 01:07:37.081
What about the thralls? As long
as the Portal remains open,

01:07:37.768 --> 01:07:40.403
We will have an entire army
between us and Rumpelstiltskin.

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:43.866
We can split up. One team to the
Portal and see if we can close it,

01:07:44.203 --> 01:07:45.723
the other one cuts a path
to City Hall.

01:07:46.231 --> 01:07:49.265
Rapunzel, Cinderella, you take
the garage beneath City Hall.

01:07:49.288 --> 01:07:50.648
That is where they are
coming from.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.199
We will take the lobby.

01:07:52.404 --> 01:07:53.324
Are you ready for this?

01:07:55.255 --> 01:07:56.356
Absolutely.

01:08:07.975 --> 01:08:09.508
This bitch!

01:08:09.863 --> 01:08:11.543
I have her. You guys worry
about the lobby.

01:08:11.692 --> 01:08:14.460
I got it. Let us go. See if
you could close that Portal.

01:09:05.384 --> 01:09:06.283
What the...

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:13.636
Does this look
like order, John?

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.093
No choice now!

01:09:36.689 --> 01:09:38.189
All right, get ready.

01:09:40.827 --> 01:09:42.194
Lock and load boys.

01:10:04.691 --> 01:10:05.824
They are coming!

01:10:21.726 --> 01:10:23.660
Are you sure you are okay?

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:25.310
Never better.

01:10:30.495 --> 01:10:31.562
Stay away from me bitch!

01:10:32.324 --> 01:10:33.492
Get away from me!

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:37.065
May I?

01:10:37.362 --> 01:10:38.262
Get away from me!

01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:40.219
Please.

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:49.478
You always have a choice.
It is not too late.

01:10:49.721 --> 01:10:50.987
It is for me!

01:10:51.048 --> 01:10:53.249
What do you think it is going
to happen now John?

01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:55.403
Do the right thing.

01:10:56.062 --> 01:10:59.966
Help us. Re-take this city.
Get your men out of here.

01:11:02.429 --> 01:11:04.530
You are not one
of his monsters.

01:11:06.252 --> 01:11:08.086
Help me close the Portal.

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:14.923
Go! Get out of here.

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:18.807
Take my men with you.

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:22.077
I will take care of this.

01:12:03.074 --> 01:12:04.075
Careful now.

01:12:28.016 --> 01:12:29.818
You really cannot stay away,
can you?

01:12:51.238 --> 01:12:52.171
John?

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:00.607
John?

01:13:20.727 --> 01:13:22.461
Who else is going
to kill The Wolf?

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.300
John.

01:13:42.432 --> 01:13:43.699
The Portal is closed.

01:13:46.144 --> 01:13:49.046
You do realize I can just open
another one, right?

01:13:53.382 --> 01:13:55.551
If it gets one degree
colder in here.

01:14:02.891 --> 01:14:03.791
Well!

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.471
You will just have to warm things
up ourselves, will not we?

01:14:19.869 --> 01:14:25.240
Do you really think it made a difference?
Having all your little friends here.

01:14:26.882 --> 01:14:29.517
I mean, we could have
avoided all of this.

01:14:31.272 --> 01:14:32.538
If you had just...

01:14:34.193 --> 01:14:36.194
given me what I wanted.

01:14:39.187 --> 01:14:43.423
You realize, I always
get what I want.

01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:46.564
Your husband gave me
what I wanted.

01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:48.751
Why will not you?

01:14:51.194 --> 01:14:55.897
Lucky for you, I am in
the mood to make a deal.

01:14:59.059 --> 01:15:00.293
Here are my terms.

01:15:00.795 --> 01:15:06.131
I just open another Portal, and if any of the
little Princesses are still alive they can leave.

01:15:06.622 --> 01:15:09.023
You can just call them off,
and I will let them go.

01:15:09.597 --> 01:15:13.198
Then your little Princesses and
the little men can try to put

01:15:13.313 --> 01:15:14.781
your kingdom back
together again.

01:15:15.329 --> 01:15:17.363
However, you, you stay here.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:19.148
And become my Queen.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:23.951
Alternatively, I
could just kill you.

01:15:25.619 --> 01:15:28.586
You can try, again.

01:15:41.278 --> 01:15:46.548
If I was you... I would
take my offer.

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:50.477
It is the best deal, you little
Princesses are ever going to get.

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.450
You are afraid they
are coming for you.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.701
- Afraid?
- Yes.

01:16:00.572 --> 01:16:03.240
I have the advantage.

01:16:15.501 --> 01:16:17.102
Hello little Piggy.

01:16:18.453 --> 01:16:20.588
You are going to die.

01:16:22.546 --> 01:16:24.781
Because I am a Piggy.

01:16:45.474 --> 01:16:47.375
You have the mirror.

01:16:49.965 --> 01:16:52.266
The entire better
to kill you with.

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:05.116
Down boy.

01:17:17.951 --> 01:17:18.984
Portal has closed.

01:17:19.356 --> 01:17:20.288
No more thralls.

01:17:20.939 --> 01:17:21.839
For now.

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:24.805
He has Snow White.

01:17:25.232 --> 01:17:26.699
We have to go, now!

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:28.710
Are you in?

01:17:34.938 --> 01:17:38.506
Rumpelstiltskin must die.

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:42.356
Times up.

01:17:44.328 --> 01:17:47.430
You always said, no life is
worth a kingdom.

01:17:48.959 --> 01:17:50.159
What about yours?

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:52.867
Stop!

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.121
- I will make this easy on you little girls.
- Kill him!

01:17:56.478 --> 01:17:58.679
- One more step and she dies!
- What is the play?

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.595
I am going to offer you
the deal of a lifetime.

01:18:11.282 --> 01:18:14.951
Leave! Go now and I will
let her live.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:17.027
Go!

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:22.115
I will kill her. I will smash the mirror. You
will never see your precious kingdom again!

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.100
Take the deal!

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:29.070
Now more deals!

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:55.930
Is he dead?

01:18:56.599 --> 01:18:57.899
Miss.

01:18:59.135 --> 01:19:00.735
Do not let him escape!

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.406
- I got them.
- Red snap out of it!

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:16.083
We cannot let the Portal close
with him on the other side!

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.287
- Keep it open!
- I do not know how!

01:19:21.219 --> 01:19:22.886
Last time I could not
control it!

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:29.029
He is getting away!

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:11.474
Hey friend, you are in the wrong
part of town dressed like that.

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:25.352
Hey! Hey you son of a bitch!
Hey, do not walk away from me!

01:20:25.537 --> 01:20:28.606
Laguardia, please! Come on.

01:20:29.281 --> 01:20:30.681
Let me out of here!

01:20:32.124 --> 01:20:33.390
He is dead.

01:20:36.866 --> 01:20:38.400
We did it.

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:45.037
- The mirror, I am sorry, I...
- It is all right.

01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:47.924
You did the right thing.

01:20:48.829 --> 01:20:50.195
Our people are safe.

01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:11.178
We are trapped here.

01:21:13.976 --> 01:21:16.878
Looks like whatever you people did
up here took care of all those...

01:21:17.932 --> 01:21:18.900
Things.

01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:25.626
Only now there is quite a few
of your people here with...

01:21:26.284 --> 01:21:27.984
No idea where here is.

01:21:29.104 --> 01:21:30.438
They are going to need help.

01:21:31.555 --> 01:21:32.955
We should go.

01:21:33.164 --> 01:21:34.765
I will take care of her.

01:21:35.708 --> 01:21:37.208
Make sure that you do.

01:21:37.624 --> 01:21:39.357
What about the rest of you?

01:21:40.222 --> 01:21:42.424
Are you just going to live
happily ever after?

01:21:48.081 --> 01:21:51.851
Snow White saw something in this
world, something worth protecting.

01:21:54.366 --> 01:21:56.400
We will keep looking
for a way home.

01:21:58.202 --> 01:22:01.672
Until we find one,
Earth is stuck with us.
