WEBVTT

00:06.056 --> 00:06.993
No, Tonya.

00:06.994 --> 00:08.016
There's no need to worry.

00:08.018 --> 00:09.717
Everything is running smoothly.

00:11.450 --> 00:13.557
Rae, tell your mother
everything is fine.

00:13.558 --> 00:15.211
Hey, Mom, we haven't
eaten for days

00:15.212 --> 00:15.822
your plants are dead

00:15.823 --> 00:16.838
and I'm dropping
out of school.

00:16.839 --> 00:17.954
Love you. Bye.

00:19.237 --> 00:21.135
It was a joke.

00:21.676 --> 00:23.170
No. No!

00:23.171 --> 00:24.259
Corey's a big boy.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.569
I let him pick out his own
clothes for school.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.983
Corey can't come
to the phone right now, but

00:32.984 --> 00:34.861
I'll send him your love. Yeah.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.252
Tell your folks
I said hello.

00:37.253 --> 00:38.292
Bye-bye.

00:39.022 --> 00:41.758
Corey, what do you have on?

00:41.759 --> 00:43.107
I'm making a statement.

00:43.108 --> 00:45.107
This says, "Hi, I'm Corey.

00:45.108 --> 00:47.047
You want to float my boat?"

00:49.642 --> 00:51.885
Oh, really?
'Cause I'm hearing

00:51.886 --> 00:52.785
"Hi, I'm Corey.

00:52.786 --> 00:53.820
Want to beat me up?"

00:55.015 --> 00:56.280
Corey, go upstairs

00:56.281 --> 00:57.807
and put on something
that doesn't quack.

00:59.057 --> 01:00.600
And Rae, come on

01:00.601 --> 01:01.586
you got to eat something

01:01.587 --> 01:02.540
before you go to school.

01:02.541 --> 01:03.520
I'm too nervous, Dad.

01:03.521 --> 01:04.766
They're announcing
who's getting the parts

01:04.766 --> 01:05.786
in The Wizard of Oz today.

01:05.787 --> 01:07.102
Uh-huh. Well, let me guess.

01:07.103 --> 01:08.854
You are going up
for the role of Dorothy.

01:08.855 --> 01:12.037
Yes, Dad, but I already
made my costume.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.117
Say good-bye to Dorothy's

01:14.118 --> 01:16.100
you know, frumpy,
blue, little farm dress

01:16.101 --> 01:18.496
and say hello to her new mini.

01:19.672 --> 01:21.007
Well, if Dorothy's
still skipping

01:21.008 --> 01:22.197
down that yellow
brick road

01:22.198 --> 01:24.367
that hemline better
come way down.

01:25.066 --> 01:26.388
Come on, Corey.

01:26.389 --> 01:28.642
I got to get
to the restaurant early today.

01:28.643 --> 01:29.946
New owner, Mr. Briggs--

01:29.947 --> 01:31.551
two words-- not nice.

01:32.236 --> 01:33.431
I'm ready now.

01:33.432 --> 01:35.958
My creativity has been squashed,
but I am ready.

01:37.761 --> 01:39.406
Good luck with the new boss
today, Dad.

01:39.407 --> 01:40.965
Oh, come on, Rae.

01:40.966 --> 01:42.205
I get along with everybody.

01:42.206 --> 01:43.939
You know, that restaurant has
had many owners

01:43.940 --> 01:46.180
but only one chef, your old man.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.698
Now please,
please eat something.

01:48.699 --> 01:49.518
Okay, okay.

01:55.155 --> 01:57.526
I've heard enough
out of you, Baxter.

01:57.527 --> 01:59.029
You're fired.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.779 --> 02:55.111
Yep, that's me.

03:01.295 --> 03:03.154
You guys,
I just had a really bad vision.

03:03.155 --> 03:05.399
I saw that my dad's going
to get fired today.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.911
Man, Rae, that's deep.

03:06.912 --> 03:08.359
I know, and I keep
calling the restaurant

03:08.360 --> 03:09.207
but the line's busy.

03:09.208 --> 03:10.207
I'm going to have
to go down there

03:10.208 --> 03:11.310
at lunch and warn him.

03:12.883 --> 03:14.424
Well, hey, since you're
going down there

03:14.425 --> 03:15.962
could you get me one of
your dad's desserts?

03:16.769 --> 03:18.031
Yeah, sure, Eddie.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.209
You know, while I'm down there

03:19.210 --> 03:20.824
I'll just be, like, "Hey, Dad,
you're getting fired.

03:20.825 --> 03:23.856
Oh, but before you go,
could you grab me a cheesecake?"

03:28.525 --> 03:30.085
This is it, you guys.

03:30.541 --> 03:31.661
Drama club.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.254
It's where people just go in
with these high hopes

03:35.255 --> 03:37.110
and come out
with crushed dreams.

03:38.157 --> 03:39.292
So, you ready?

03:40.540 --> 03:41.588
I was.

03:42.251 --> 03:46.106
Well, just remember, if we don't
get the part that we want

03:46.107 --> 03:48.973
it doesn't change who we are
on the inside.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.811
I got the part!

03:51.812 --> 03:53.036
I'm the Scarecrow!

03:53.037 --> 03:55.201
My life has meaning!

03:56.158 --> 03:57.882
I must have
had the best audition, huh?

03:58.300 --> 03:59.219
No.

03:59.425 --> 04:00.841
But Rodney is sick.

04:03.105 --> 04:04.322
I still got it.

04:07.225 --> 04:09.590
Kayla, I just wanted to say

04:09.625 --> 04:11.800
whoever gets the part,
no hard feelings.

04:11.802 --> 04:13.616
Oh, how sweet.

04:13.618 --> 04:16.185
I should say something nice
to you.

04:17.317 --> 04:18.504
I got nothing.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.246
Hater.

04:24.066 --> 04:26.685
And now,
after careful consideration

04:26.687 --> 04:27.795
I have decided

04:27.798 --> 04:31.405
that the crucial role
of Dorothy will be played by...

04:32.356 --> 04:33.484
Raven...

04:33.486 --> 04:34.537
Yes!

04:35.415 --> 04:37.335
I thought you were here.

04:37.337 --> 04:38.758
Why did I mark you absent?

04:40.399 --> 04:41.021
Okay

04:41.023 --> 04:41.800
where was I?

04:41.802 --> 04:43.324
Dorothy?
Oh, yes.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.986
Such a fun part.

04:44.988 --> 04:47.328
And it will played by...

04:47.330 --> 04:48.455
Kayla Simms.

04:48.457 --> 04:50.204
Oh-ho!

04:50.206 --> 04:51.776
I don't believe it!

04:51.778 --> 04:52.908
Is this real?

04:52.910 --> 04:55.283
Oh, somebody pinch me.

04:56.359 --> 04:57.790
Ooh, must be real.

05:00.295 --> 05:01.465
Rae, don't worry
about it.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.356
It's just a part.

05:02.358 --> 05:03.034
It's not a big deal.

05:03.036 --> 05:03.938
And the Wicked Witch

05:03.940 --> 05:06.543
of the West will be
Chelsea Daniels.

05:06.545 --> 05:08.624
Yes, I got the part!
I got the part!

05:08.626 --> 05:09.767
That's right.
Who's your witch?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.937
Who's your witch?
Who's your witch?

05:13.425 --> 05:15.377
Yeah, not that
it's any big deal.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.172
Victor, what is this?

05:27.174 --> 05:29.532
It's my famous
stuffed artichoke.

05:29.534 --> 05:32.629
No. It's your famous
huge artichoke.

05:32.631 --> 05:35.003
Huge means I pay
more for it.

05:35.005 --> 05:36.580
I hate huge.

05:37.616 --> 05:40.782
Mr. Briggs, I personally
handpicked this produce myself.

05:40.784 --> 05:43.628
My motto is,
the customer always comes back

05:43.630 --> 05:45.474
when quality is the main
ingredient.

05:45.476 --> 05:46.368
Really?

05:46.370 --> 05:48.641
My motto is,
I own the place.

05:49.656 --> 05:51.122
Go salt something.

05:52.471 --> 05:53.362
Thank you.

05:57.495 --> 05:59.928
Hi. I'm Raven,
Victor's daughter.

05:59.930 --> 06:01.070
Hi. How are you?

06:01.072 --> 06:02.493
Nice to... Bye-bye.

06:04.558 --> 06:07.342
Um, I just... I just didn't mean
to bother you, but...

06:07.344 --> 06:09.062
And yet, here you stand.

06:11.373 --> 06:13.299
I just wanted to say
that, you know

06:13.301 --> 06:15.663
my Dad's just really passionate
about food

06:15.665 --> 06:17.005
and-and that's
what makes him a great chef.

06:17.007 --> 06:19.766
I mean, you are totally lucky
to have him.

06:19.768 --> 06:22.151
Tons of restaurants are dying
to hire him.

06:22.153 --> 06:23.718
Really? Oh,
is that so?

06:23.720 --> 06:24.896
Hi. How are you?

06:25.932 --> 06:27.695
Uh... yes, yes.

06:27.697 --> 06:28.831
It's-it's very so.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.362
So, since you have him

06:30.364 --> 06:31.817
hold on to him
really tight.

06:31.820 --> 06:32.780
Well, I'll tell you

06:32.782 --> 06:34.369
since you're following
me anyway...

06:36.193 --> 06:38.294
I- I think
your father's a wonderful chef

06:38.296 --> 06:39.790
and-and I'm very happy with him.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.682
Okay?

06:40.684 --> 06:43.196
Okay. See, that is
what I wanted to hear.

06:43.198 --> 06:45.448
Oh, good. You know
what I want to hear?

06:45.985 --> 06:46.959
Bye-bye?

06:46.961 --> 06:48.136
Oh, you're good.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.046
Rae?

06:51.049 --> 06:52.789
Rae, What are you doing here?

06:53.260 --> 06:55.814
Oh. Yeah, what am I doing here?

06:55.816 --> 06:56.616
Let me guess.

06:56.618 --> 06:58.031
You got the part of Dorothy.

06:58.744 --> 06:59.890
No.

06:59.892 --> 07:01.078
I- I didn't get it.

07:01.395 --> 07:03.175
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.
That's okay.

07:03.177 --> 07:05.193
That's what I came here for,
to tell you that

07:05.195 --> 07:06.301
and-and that I'm okay with it.

07:06.317 --> 07:08.108
Well, that's the Rae I know.

07:08.110 --> 07:09.650
Yeah. So, I'm going back
to school

07:09.652 --> 07:10.946
and you, Daddy--

07:10.948 --> 07:12.946
you have a great day.

07:12.948 --> 07:13.895
Okay.

07:16.063 --> 07:18.486
So, I see you met
my daughter Raven.

07:18.488 --> 07:19.727
She's really great.

07:20.096 --> 07:21.386
Really?

07:21.873 --> 07:24.137
She must be having an off day.

07:32.764 --> 07:34.423
Now, you guys,
before we start rehearsal

07:34.425 --> 07:35.333
I'd just like to say

07:35.338 --> 07:37.908
there's so much stuff
I could do with this part.

07:37.911 --> 07:38.981
Yeah.

07:38.983 --> 07:40.385
That's cool, Rae, but really

07:40.387 --> 07:42.163
um, you're the Wicked Witch
of the East

07:42.165 --> 07:43.981
and your part's
lying under a house.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.000
Yeah.

07:45.002 --> 07:47.232
Get under the coffee table
and stick your feet out.

07:49.295 --> 07:50.626
No. No, no, no, no, no.

07:50.627 --> 07:51.490
You don't get it.

07:51.493 --> 07:53.765
See, I've been working
on this part.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.877
I call this
"Death of a Witch."

08:01.250 --> 08:02.595
# Something's coming #

08:02.597 --> 08:04.187
# It's a house #

08:04.189 --> 08:07.569
# I'll be under it
in this blouse #

08:07.993 --> 08:11.337
# That I bought today. #

08:14.225 --> 08:16.339
Rae, Rae? Rae, Rae.

08:16.341 --> 08:17.935
Rae, Rae. Rae!

08:17.937 --> 08:19.398
Rae, Rae, Rae.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.262
Rae, Rae, Rae!

08:21.227 --> 08:22.417
Let me show
you something.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.217
Look, come
here, come on.

08:23.219 --> 08:25.854
You are a squished
witch, all right?

08:25.856 --> 08:27.026
Okay, now let me...

08:27.028 --> 08:28.910
Come on down right here.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.558
That's what you do.

08:34.294 --> 08:35.936
You know what? Fine.

08:37.095 --> 08:38.323
This is a lame part anyway.

08:38.325 --> 08:40.346
I'm just going to tell
Senorita Rodriguez I quit.

08:41.697 --> 08:42.744
What's up, Mr. Baxter?

08:42.746 --> 08:44.167
Hi, Mr. Baxter.
Hey, Dad.

08:44.169 --> 08:45.437
What are you doing home
so early?

08:45.439 --> 08:46.358
What kind of greeting is that?

08:46.361 --> 08:47.526
What about, "Dad's home.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.035
Let's party?!"

08:52.238 --> 08:53.587
He sure is in a good mood.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.820
No. Something's wrong.

08:59.853 --> 09:01.052
Dad, are you okay?

09:01.054 --> 09:02.626
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:02.628 --> 09:03.802
Just making a
little soup.

09:05.026 --> 09:06.768
It might be a little less chunky

09:06.770 --> 09:08.041
without the can.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.750
What's going on?

09:12.430 --> 09:13.594
Oh, nothing.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.018
I just got into
a little argument

09:15.020 --> 09:16.239
with Mr. Briggs.

09:16.242 --> 09:17.050
Dad, what happened?

09:17.051 --> 09:19.251
I mean, when I left
everything seemed great.

09:19.253 --> 09:21.070
You know, nothing's
ever great with that guy.

09:21.073 --> 09:22.941
He even had a problem
with you coming down today.

09:22.943 --> 09:25.125
Like you even said more
than two words to him.

09:25.380 --> 09:26.811
Two?

09:26.813 --> 09:28.201
Maybe three. Four.

09:28.203 --> 09:29.526
Dad, four tops.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.224
And then he said
if I had a problem

09:31.226 --> 09:33.219
with the way
he wants things done

09:33.221 --> 09:35.765
that I should go work at one
of the tons of restaurants

09:35.767 --> 09:37.375
that were dying to hire me.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.654
I don't even know
where he got that from.

09:42.465 --> 09:44.630
You got fired, didn't you?

09:45.415 --> 09:48.036
Um, yeah, baby, I got fired.

09:48.038 --> 09:50.003
But everything is going
to be okay.

09:50.279 --> 09:52.681
Dad, I am so sorry.

09:52.683 --> 09:53.947
Oh, baby, don't be.

09:54.515 --> 09:57.068
It's not like it's
your fault, you know?

10:09.165 --> 10:11.625
Rae, it is not your fault
your dad got fired.

10:11.660 --> 10:12.624
Chelsea

10:12.626 --> 10:14.570
if I didn't go down there
and bother his boss

10:14.571 --> 10:16.470
he would still have a job.

10:16.813 --> 10:18.699
That is so true.

10:21.025 --> 10:22.610
Stand here.

10:22.645 --> 10:23.749
Stand there.

10:23.751 --> 10:25.143
Hold this.

10:29.025 --> 10:30.450
Nine feet.

10:30.452 --> 10:32.418
Yep, my bed can go
right here.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.487
Excuse me, what are you doing?

10:34.489 --> 10:36.051
Making sure all my stuff's
going to fit.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.099
'Cause when Dad finds out
you got him fired

10:38.101 --> 10:39.052
you'll be history.

10:39.099 --> 10:40.491
And this
will all be mine.

10:41.420 --> 10:43.140
Hey, baby,
you like my new crib?

10:45.865 --> 10:48.115
Rae, why don't you just go
talk to Mr. Briggs

10:48.116 --> 10:49.346
tell him you're sorry

10:49.349 --> 10:50.508
and maybe he'll hire
your dad back.

10:50.510 --> 10:52.259
This paint has got to go!

10:52.261 --> 10:54.520
Uh, look, munchkin,
I've had enough of you.

10:54.522 --> 10:56.470
I am going to the restaurant
tomorrow

10:56.473 --> 10:57.619
to get Dad's job back.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.371
And until then,
hey, you see the finger?

10:59.373 --> 11:00.501
You see the finger?

11:00.503 --> 11:02.974
The finger's looking at the
room, and the finger, yes

11:02.976 --> 11:04.275
the room is mine!

11:04.277 --> 11:05.419
So good-bye.

11:10.625 --> 11:12.801
All right,
good-good-bye.

11:13.793 --> 11:15.032
Hi, me again.

11:15.667 --> 11:16.857
Oh, goody.

11:16.858 --> 11:18.432
Wishes do come true.

11:19.676 --> 11:22.633
Yes, and I wish that you'd hire
my dad back.

11:22.635 --> 11:24.743
And then, some wishes don't.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.316
Mr. Briggs, look.

11:28.318 --> 11:29.911
I don't think my dad
should be fired

11:29.913 --> 11:31.115
because of my mistake.

11:31.117 --> 11:33.647
You know, I think it's
just... nifty

11:33.649 --> 11:35.835
that you came
all the way down here

11:35.837 --> 11:37.697
to... stick up
for your dad.

11:37.699 --> 11:38.962
Right or wrong

11:39.321 --> 11:41.890
ever notice how nifty people
never win?

11:44.105 --> 11:46.128
Your dad's not getting
his job back.

11:48.536 --> 11:52.473
Hey, Mr. Briggs,
now, you don't fool me, okay?

11:52.475 --> 11:54.065
You're trying to talk tough

11:54.643 --> 11:57.713
but I can see that you're
a very kind, sensitive

11:57.715 --> 11:59.494
warm, forgiving person.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.117
Dear child, you see right
through me, don't you?

12:03.900 --> 12:04.808
Listen, Robin...

12:04.810 --> 12:05.353
Raven.

12:05.355 --> 12:06.068
Whatever.

12:06.070 --> 12:07.835
A little advice, kid.

12:07.837 --> 12:10.607
Kissing up will
get you nowhere.

12:11.649 --> 12:14.173
Hello, Mr. Q.Z.!

12:14.175 --> 12:16.539
So nice to see you again.

12:17.715 --> 12:19.555
Q.Z. in the hiz-house.

12:23.007 --> 12:25.213
P- P-Peace to the brothers.

12:26.475 --> 12:28.615
I see you brought the whole...
the whole posse.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.346
I have a lovely table
for you.

12:31.465 --> 12:33.025
I loved your last video.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.670
It was slammin'.

12:41.829 --> 12:42.718
All right, all right.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.753
Everybody step back.

12:43.755 --> 12:44.408
Yes

12:44.411 --> 12:47.101
famous person's
coming through.

12:51.739 --> 12:53.395
Welcome to Augustine's.

12:53.430 --> 12:54.595
Two steps back.

12:54.597 --> 12:55.692
Please.

12:56.162 --> 12:57.638
Stop looking at me.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.848
Why can't I just blend in?

13:01.056 --> 13:02.251
Get me our usual table.

13:02.253 --> 13:04.321
Y- Your usual table?

13:04.323 --> 13:05.315
He's looking me
in the eye.

13:05.316 --> 13:06.103
Don't do that.

13:07.547 --> 13:09.055
Does you know who I be?

13:09.057 --> 13:10.710
Does you listen to music?

13:10.712 --> 13:11.875
Do you watch TV?

13:11.877 --> 13:14.594
Do you carry
a lunch box?

13:16.575 --> 13:18.176
Poppy, tell him who I be.

13:18.928 --> 13:19.888
Me?

13:21.624 --> 13:25.095
You don't expect me
to introduce...

13:25.130 --> 13:26.952
me do you?

13:28.995 --> 13:30.971
Well, uh, you know, uh,
that-that's...

13:32.502 --> 13:34.837
Right, uh,
th-that's Liz Onya.

13:36.369 --> 13:40.061
Oh! Oh, Li... oh!
Right! Right!

13:40.063 --> 13:43.901
Right, right, right this way,
Miss-Miss Onya.

13:44.595 --> 13:45.486
Liz Onya?

13:45.488 --> 13:47.300
Hey, you was almost about to be
Pork Choppa.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.663
I don't need a menu!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.235
Just have Victor prepare
my usual.

13:55.237 --> 13:57.984
Oh, Victor doesn't work here
anymore.

14:01.265 --> 14:03.599
Are you joking?!

14:03.601 --> 14:04.895
Shh!
Don't shush her.

14:07.703 --> 14:09.401
This restaurant is

14:09.403 --> 14:11.340
nothing without Victor.

14:11.342 --> 14:12.152
Where is he?

14:12.154 --> 14:13.946
You know, if I were you

14:13.948 --> 14:15.923
I'd get Victor
back right now.

14:15.925 --> 14:18.159
Get me J-Lo!

14:18.161 --> 14:20.829
Oh...! It's too late!

14:24.365 --> 14:25.330
Hey, girlfriend.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.852
Yeah, let me tell you something.

14:26.853 --> 14:30.950
I'm down here at Augustine's
and this fool fired our Victor.

14:30.952 --> 14:33.239
I know, no... all right.

14:33.261 --> 14:36.512
She wants to
speak to you.

14:40.465 --> 14:42.559
Jennifer Lopez wants
to talk to me?

14:42.561 --> 14:43.516
Don't look at the phone,
brother.

14:43.518 --> 14:44.437
No.

14:46.865 --> 14:49.310
H- H-Hello, Ms. Lopez.

14:49.312 --> 14:51.908
Yeah, I just want to say
I'm a b-big, big fan.

14:51.910 --> 14:53.468
Don't you sweet talk me.

14:53.469 --> 14:55.563
Not after what you did
to my Victor.

14:55.565 --> 14:58.832
You want to see my back
then get Victor back!

15:08.662 --> 15:11.390
Mom says all boys' voices
change at this age.

15:11.392 --> 15:14.471
And anyone who makes fun of me
is just mean.

15:19.065 --> 15:20.454
The only reason
I came here

15:20.456 --> 15:22.642
is for Victor's cooking!

15:23.568 --> 15:25.721
And I'm sure I'm not
the only one.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.312
Excuse me.

15:29.769 --> 15:34.222
Victor would've never served
an artichoke that scrawny!

15:37.611 --> 15:38.928
And Victor

15:38.930 --> 15:41.655
never used this ingredient
in his cooking.

15:41.657 --> 15:42.934
Take that back!

15:42.936 --> 15:44.729
Uh, excuse me.

15:44.731 --> 15:46.141
Some of our customer's
are wondering

15:46.143 --> 15:48.143
if you'll sing something
off your new CD?

15:48.145 --> 15:49.525
They are?

15:51.605 --> 15:52.899
Oh, please sing.

15:52.901 --> 15:54.308
It's a wonderful idea.

15:54.310 --> 15:55.789
Please sing
something, please.

15:55.790 --> 15:57.385
No, I'm not sure I can.

15:57.387 --> 15:58.288
No, no, no.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.456
She cannot
just sing cold.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.054
I mean, really.

16:02.056 --> 16:05.166
Uh, yeah, uh, uh,
Liz Onya's always better, uh

16:05.168 --> 16:06.523
warmed up, brother.

16:07.095 --> 16:09.110
I'll consider hiring
Victor back.

16:11.344 --> 16:14.215
It's showtime...!

16:21.638 --> 16:24.776
I think I'll do a song, uh,
that I just wrote. Okay.

16:25.324 --> 16:26.613
Rae, I only know one song.

16:26.615 --> 16:28.942
Then just play it
and make it funky.

16:28.944 --> 16:29.883
I...

16:30.625 --> 16:32.891
And it goes a little
something like this.

16:45.965 --> 16:48.095
# Oh, when the saints, ooh #

16:48.097 --> 16:49.587
# Go marching in #

16:49.589 --> 16:53.581
# Oh, when the saints
go marching in #

16:54.039 --> 16:58.203
# Oh, yes, I want
to be in that number #

16:58.205 --> 17:01.563
# When the saints
go marching in #

17:01.565 --> 17:03.604
Take it, Poppy.
# Oh, when the saints #

17:03.606 --> 17:05.500
This steak is rare.
# Go marching in #

17:05.502 --> 17:06.656
Take it back.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.098
# Oh, when the saints #

17:08.101 --> 17:09.887
# Go marching in #

17:09.888 --> 17:11.361
Excuse me, ooh, too much garlic.

17:11.371 --> 17:13.031
Take this. Take this.

17:13.691 --> 17:15.417
She ain't kissing you
good night.

17:15.419 --> 17:18.089
# Oh, when the saints
go marching in #

17:18.092 --> 17:20.125
Everybody!
# Since Victor left #

17:20.127 --> 17:21.156
# Since Victor left #

17:21.159 --> 17:23.228
# The food's no good #
# The food's no good #

17:23.229 --> 17:26.960
# Since Victor left,
the food's no good #

17:26.962 --> 17:31.457
# It's undercooked,
and poorly seasoned #

17:31.459 --> 17:34.849
# Since Victor left,
the food's no good #

17:34.850 --> 17:36.589
# Since Victor left #

17:36.592 --> 17:37.711
# Since Victor left #

17:37.713 --> 17:39.903
# The food's no good #

17:39.905 --> 17:43.788
# Since Victor left,
the food's no good #

17:43.790 --> 17:47.666
# It's undercooked
and poorly seasoned #

17:47.667 --> 17:51.657
# Since Victor left,
the food's no good #

17:51.659 --> 17:53.175
# Tell Mr. Briggs! #

17:53.177 --> 17:54.317
Look over there!

17:54.319 --> 17:55.397
# Bring Victor back! #

17:55.399 --> 17:56.495
Right over there!

17:56.497 --> 18:00.201
# Tell Mr. Briggs,
bring Victor back #

18:00.203 --> 18:04.347
# I better wrap up this number #

18:04.349 --> 18:05.941
# Tell Mr. Briggs #

18:05.943 --> 18:12.893
# Bring Victor back...! #

18:12.895 --> 18:14.714
# I'll bring
him back. #

18:16.268 --> 18:17.472
I love you.

18:17.474 --> 18:18.479
I love you all.

18:18.481 --> 18:19.501
And more importantly

18:19.503 --> 18:21.063
you love me. Okay.

18:24.064 --> 18:25.370
Um... just going to go

18:25.372 --> 18:26.483
through the kitchen.

18:43.295 --> 18:44.430
I know.

18:44.465 --> 18:46.479
You recognize greatness.

18:46.481 --> 18:47.773
No, Anti Pasta...

18:47.775 --> 18:48.477
Liz Onya.

18:48.479 --> 18:49.344
Whatever.

18:50.625 --> 18:52.314
But I do recognize you.

18:54.791 --> 18:57.346
Don't you just hate it
when the bad guy wins?

19:00.962 --> 19:01.780
Don't look at me.

19:01.782 --> 19:02.771
Oh, of course not.

19:04.986 --> 19:07.354
Raven, I was wrong.

19:07.357 --> 19:08.914
You have a lovely voice.

19:08.916 --> 19:10.937
You should have gotten the part
of Dorothy.

19:10.939 --> 19:12.497
So I'm getting the part?

19:12.895 --> 19:13.927
No.

19:21.422 --> 19:23.762
Y- Yeah, but...
Mr. Briggs, it...

19:23.764 --> 19:25.389
She said that?

19:25.760 --> 19:26.720
But...

19:27.161 --> 19:29.081
But... but...

19:31.893 --> 19:33.030
Whatever.

19:35.065 --> 19:37.027
That was Mr. Briggs, Raven.

19:37.029 --> 19:39.087
Or should I say Liz Onya?

19:40.223 --> 19:40.966
You know

19:40.968 --> 19:43.055
I don't think I've ever heard
him that mad before.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.507
Way to go, Raven.

19:48.791 --> 19:50.303
So, Dad, you're okay?

19:50.304 --> 19:51.530
Absolutely.

19:51.532 --> 19:53.694
You know,
sometimes bad news

19:53.696 --> 19:55.590
is really an opportunity
in disguise.

19:55.592 --> 19:58.425
Like when I was in high school
on the football team.

19:58.427 --> 20:01.836
It was homecoming weekend
and I got hurt really bad.

20:01.838 --> 20:03.868
Ooh, Dad, what happened?
A bad tackle?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.453
No, they cut me from the team--
that hurt really bad.

20:07.563 --> 20:09.110
Thanks for the tip, Dad.

20:09.111 --> 20:10.573
No, my point is

20:10.576 --> 20:13.428
because I didn't have
to go to practice

20:13.430 --> 20:14.755
I had more free time.

20:14.757 --> 20:16.894
So, I started hanging out
with your grandmother.

20:16.896 --> 20:18.497
Started helping her out
in the kitchen.

20:18.499 --> 20:21.352
And that's when I realized
I love to cook.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.026
You never told
me that story.

20:23.027 --> 20:26.529
Yeah, but see, the point
of this whole thing is

20:26.531 --> 20:30.616
life is going to knock you down
sometimes, and that's okay.

20:30.618 --> 20:34.668
But what's not okay is when
you let life keep you down.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.990
Don't worry.

20:36.025 --> 20:37.409
Everything's going
to be okay.

20:37.463 --> 20:39.348
I'm not going to be down
for long.

20:52.965 --> 20:54.553
I'm sure you'll
think of something.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.690
Let me see this
cake, will you?

21:06.839 --> 21:08.909
You know Senorita Rodriguez

21:08.911 --> 21:11.847
even though I only got the part
of the Wicked Witch of the East

21:11.850 --> 21:15.015
I'm okay with that because I
figured, "Hey, that's life."

21:15.017 --> 21:16.774
And it's not going
to keep me down.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.942
That's a good way
to look at it, Raven.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.149
So, since, you know,
I don't have any lines

21:21.151 --> 21:23.285
I'm going to have
a lot of free time.

21:23.287 --> 21:24.485
And I wanted to, you know

21:24.487 --> 21:25.791
design the costumes
for the show.

21:26.364 --> 21:27.920
So, introducing

21:27.922 --> 21:30.101
Scarecrow from the 'hood.

21:30.103 --> 21:30.982
Come on.

21:35.438 --> 21:38.872
And happenin' Wicked Witch.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.492
