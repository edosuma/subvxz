00:02.400 --> 00:04.159
You're beautiful.

00:04.160 --> 00:06.159
No, I'm not.
I'm a no good shit magnet.

00:06.160 --> 00:09.879
Get fucked, burn it to the ground,
dance on the embers
then get on your coach.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.079
Are we still friends?

00:11.080 --> 00:15.079
I was hoping more than that.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.839
Liv, whatever he's told you,
don't believe him, he's a psycho.

00:18.840 --> 00:19.559
Stay away from her.

00:19.560 --> 00:20.679
Stay away from her.
Why do you care?

00:20.680 --> 00:22.559
They're brothers.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.519
I hope you die
puking on your kidneys.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.359
Bitch.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.359
I need to come back.
Please talk to Dad for me.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.679
Epic move, boys.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.279
Rider, that switch, genius.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.639
You too, skip.
That's what it's about...

01:36.640 --> 01:39.159
movement, commitment - we'll kill
these bastards with that shit.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.839
Nice work, boys. Nice work.
Nick, spot-on, ja.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.839
Now, get cleaned up.
Last one in the showers is a homo!

01:48.400 --> 01:50.759
I'm a man who fought
for my beliefs, ja?

01:50.760 --> 01:52.719
Fought for my people.

01:52.720 --> 01:56.719
Fought for the brotherhood of a
nation,the rainbow nation.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.959
And through togetherness
and respect for each other,

02:01.320 --> 02:05.319
we defeated the greatest injustice
in the world - apartheid.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.439
Er, what is apartheid?

02:10.840 --> 02:14.839
The fact is success in life

02:15.160 --> 02:18.919
is only as important
as the people you share it with, hm?

02:18.920 --> 02:22.919
This is your family, this team.

02:23.240 --> 02:26.359
And if you can stand up
for each other out on that pitch,

02:26.360 --> 02:30.359
you can do anything. Nick...

02:35.200 --> 02:38.719
This Friday, there are gonna be
30 men on that pitch.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.119
15 of them are gonna be winners.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.639
15 of them are gonna be bitches.
Which d'you want to be?

02:44.640 --> 02:46.679
Winners!
Damn right.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.359
Cos this is a team of winners.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.919
We're not gonna allow ourselves to
fail,

02:49.920 --> 02:53.319
cos failure's a giant bitch
with sharp claws.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.239
We're gonna gang-rape failure.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.159
We're gonna hold it down
and we're gonna...

02:57.160 --> 02:59.879
Nick, I think you've taken that
metaphor far enough, ja.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.679
Aye aye, coach.
But you get the point.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.759
We're gonna smash it - right, boys?

03:04.760 --> 03:05.799
Fuck, yes!

03:05.800 --> 03:07.959
Fuck, yes, indeed.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.039
You're crying, Warren.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.959
She left you because you're a crying
man. Nobody loves a crying man.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.519
Feel that pain in your chest,
Warren.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.679
It's not stress.
It's not cholesterol either.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.799
It's breasts...
budding where your pecs should be.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.799
Instead of man-armour,
you're growing tits, Warren. Tits!

03:28.160 --> 03:30.119
It's no wonder she's fucking around.

03:30.120 --> 03:34.119
Now, put down the pills,
grow a pair and stand up for
yourself.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.319
Suicide is for quitters, Warren.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.319
Listen to your life coach.
Peace out.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.039
What's this?

03:51.040 --> 03:53.919
It's a set of rules. A contract.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.079
It's...

03:57.080 --> 03:58.639
...comprehensive.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.519
I'm not taking any chances
this time.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.879
"No girls in the bedroom.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.319
"I shall not use
my father's sporting equipment"...?

04:06.320 --> 04:09.039
Yeah, that last one especially.
Not having you go batshit on us
again.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.679
Right, Nick?
Right.

04:10.680 --> 04:14.679
"I will complete my education."

04:16.560 --> 04:19.079
I was thinking of getting a job,
actually -

04:19.079 --> 04:20.358
something that lets me do my music.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.119
Drug music. Where's the money in
that?

04:22.120 --> 04:23.559
There isn't.
That's why I need a job.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.879
You'll finish your education,

04:24.880 --> 04:26.599
that's what you'll do.
Don't I get a choice?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.599
Oh, yes, Matthew, you've got a
choice.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.959
You can stay here,

04:30.960 --> 04:32.999
obey my rules and behave.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.439
Or you can fuck off!

04:34.440 --> 04:36.479
How does that sound?

04:36.480 --> 04:38.039
It sounds good to me!

04:38.040 --> 04:40.639
The Levan boys, back together!

04:40.640 --> 04:44.559
Cheers, guys.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.879
See that, Matty?

04:46.880 --> 04:49.239
That's "can do" attitude.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.759
Yeah?

04:50.760 --> 04:53.519
Now, you follow those rules, do as I
say,

04:53.520 --> 04:56.159
you could be just like Nick.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.359
Well, we all need a role model,
right?Was that sarcasm?

04:59.360 --> 05:02.399
Dad, chillax.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.399
Look at his face -
it's super sincere.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.119
It better be.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.119
Sign it.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.199
Nick, witness.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.079
Good.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.439
Right, I've got to go.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.199
Warren's threatening to overdose
again,

05:38.200 --> 05:40.719
and I need to take him for a game of
golf,

05:40.720 --> 05:42.119
try out my new driver.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.159
Callaway.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.679
Big Bertha. Hollow head.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.599
Tasty.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.199
Thwack!

05:53.200 --> 05:54.639
In the hole!

05:59.000 --> 06:01.119
I've got a meeting
with your principal this morning.

06:01.120 --> 06:05.119
Don't be late. Nick, a word.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.279
Listen, if he starts
any of his mind games...

06:08.280 --> 06:10.679
Yeah, phase that shit right out.
...just remember you're better than
him.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.679
Laters.
Yeah.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.639
Got a minute?

06:24.640 --> 06:28.639
Course.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.959
Man, I'm so psyched for this game on
Friday. It's gonna be epic. You
coming?

06:34.720 --> 06:37.119
Yeah. Course. Will Dad be there?

06:37.120 --> 06:38.959
Yeah.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.959
I mean, I hope so,
but he's really busy, so... yeah.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.359
Listen, mate,

06:51.360 --> 06:54.119
I just wanted you to know something.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.799
You're my big brother.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.799
We've had beefs, yeah,
but... fuck that shit.

07:00.960 --> 07:04.159
You said sorry.That was all I
needed.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.479
We move on. Agreed?

07:06.480 --> 07:08.079
Cool.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.679
You know it. Gonna be smooth as.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.679
What about Liv?

07:17.960 --> 07:19.919
What about her?

07:19.920 --> 07:23.159
Well, don't we have to talk
about...?
We don't have to do anything.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.399
Me and her, it was...

07:25.400 --> 07:28.239
a thing, a bit of fun.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.839
Nothing else.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.839
Yeah, she was into me,
but I was just dealing with shit.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.999
Really?
Totally.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.999
Seriously,
you have nothing to worry about.

07:42.680 --> 07:46.679
I wasn't worrying about me.
Good.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.719
Are you into her?
Dunno. Might be.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.959
So you're fine with it, then?

07:57.960 --> 07:59.999
Super fine!

08:00.000 --> 08:02.759
Me and Mini are better than ever.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.479
Deep shit.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.999
Cool.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.279
That'll be her now.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.639
Matty, the rules!

08:13.640 --> 08:16.519
Yeah, I know, but I didn't know them
when she called.

08:16.520 --> 08:20.519
Yeah, but still...
Listen, Nick...

08:21.600 --> 08:25.599
...you trust me, right?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.999
Fine. I get it.

08:33.200 --> 08:37.198
Compromise. Give. Take.

08:38.159 --> 08:42.159
You're a star.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.919
Mini, it's me.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.919
I need to see you.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.519
Hi.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.839
Your mum let me in.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.479
Prepare to be spoiled.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.479
Flowers, chocolates, oils.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.639
They're beautiful.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.639
Of course, I can't eat
the chocolates, but Mum...

09:47.440 --> 09:48.599
Oils?

09:48.600 --> 09:52.599
Massage oils.
You're in for some Nick nuzzling.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.199
How's that? Good, yeah?

10:10.200 --> 10:11.479
Great.

10:11.480 --> 10:15.479
You know it.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.439
That's... That's really...

10:19.440 --> 10:20.719
God, Nick! Nick!

10:20.720 --> 10:21.639
What?

10:21.640 --> 10:25.639
What?
You're... you're jabbing into me
with... it.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.239
Yeah, he's feeling left out.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.719
Argh, not... not there!

10:52.720 --> 10:56.719
Argh, not... not there!
Shit. Sorry.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.599
Do you want to go on top?

11:09.720 --> 11:10.919
Quickly.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.599
I'm trying.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.599
It won't...

11:23.720 --> 11:27.319
And if we get to the final,
there'll be scouts and shit,

11:27.320 --> 11:29.199
and that means one thing.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.319
Really? What sort of scouts?

11:31.320 --> 11:32.799
Pros. The big time, baby!

11:32.800 --> 11:35.839
I could be your WAG.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.719
There's Matty. Come on.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.919
What happened to you?

11:39.920 --> 11:43.639
Went to meet my favourite girl...
Mini.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.799
Hi, Liv.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.839
Isn't this great?
Two brothers, two best mates.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.239
The awesome foursome
in the perfect storm.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.719
Didn't everyone die
in The Perfect Storm?

11:52.720 --> 11:55.599
Didn't everyone die
in The Perfect Storm?
Details, mate.
The point is, we're wet...

11:55.600 --> 11:58.399
and... dangerous.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.519
There's my boys. Check this out.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.799
Go on, mate.

12:15.400 --> 12:19.399
Spank that ball, baby.
Spank that ball.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.479
Jizz ball, you big gay!

12:27.480 --> 12:31.479
Later, homos.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.159
Love those guys.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.039
Here comes the old man.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.039
Boys.

12:41.040 --> 12:45.039
Laters, girls.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.559
Don't.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.999
What?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.999
Whatever it is. Just don't.

12:59.240 --> 13:03.239
Well, it's a most irregular
situation. We're well into term.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.599
Matthew's record is hardly
unblemished.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.399
In fact, it is positively
flecked with failure,

13:10.400 --> 13:12.959
disobedience and misdemeanour.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.479
He was misunderstood, sir.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.479
A history of drug abuse
and violence.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.839
We dropped those charges.
That Matty's in the past.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.359
He's moved on, sir.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.839
Right.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.279
Mr Blood.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.319
When I first agreed
to send Nick here,

13:33.320 --> 13:37.319
despite offers from several other,
and frankly better, alternatives,

13:37.680 --> 13:39.839
you promised certain privileges.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.359
Of course, some of those offers
are still... on the table.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.199
I see.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.999
And what of Mrs Levan?

13:49.000 --> 13:52.999
Is she as committed
to this new direction?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.839
Mrs Levan isn't committed
to anything.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.839
Her family in particular,
as well you know.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.879
Professor Blood, you brought me here
to win games. I'm winning games.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.919
As I said he would.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.239
Straight up.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.999
He won't step out of line,
out of respect for me.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.359
Right, Matthew?

14:15.360 --> 14:19.359
100%.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.959
Very well. He may re-enrol.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.759
On probation.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.119
Thank you, sir.
That is absolutely wicked.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.919
What a bell-end. Who does he think
he is? Giving it the big I am.

14:33.920 --> 14:37.759
He's just a jumped up babysitter
with an office. Prick!

14:37.760 --> 14:40.639
Right. I've got to go.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.439
Places to be. Clients to save.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.279
Just you remember,

14:45.280 --> 14:49.279
every move you make,
every step you take...

14:51.280 --> 14:54.599
...I'll be watching you.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.519
Isn't that The Police?

14:55.520 --> 14:57.199
Isn't that The Police?
It will be, my boy, if you fuck up.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.959
OK.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.879
It will be.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.879
Right-o.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.719
High five, Mattattack, you're in!

15:13.720 --> 15:16.879
Fuck me, dude. I don't know how
you put up with this shit.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.519
What do you mean, "put up"?

15:18.520 --> 15:21.599
I've got it all right here.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.559
It's all right here in the
Nickosaur's mighty palm of destiny.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.399
If you say so.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.919
If you say so.
Of course I do. Come on.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.399
Hop in, we'll go meet the gang.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.679
The rugby guys?

15:32.680 --> 15:36.679
No! My guys. The gang!
You'll love them, come on!

15:41.560 --> 15:42.759
Shithead.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.839
Bollocks!

15:43.840 --> 15:45.999
Officer on deck.
How's the wriggle team?

15:46.000 --> 15:49.999
Oh, thank God. My hero boyfriend
is here to save the day.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.959
Listen, guys.This is Matty.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.959
I know you met him before, but that
was all, well, drama-rama, so...

15:57.240 --> 15:58.479
It's you.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.039
Hi.

16:00.040 --> 16:03.639
You two know each other?

16:03.640 --> 16:06.759
We met once.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.799
So you were homeless?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.559
More on the move.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.479
It must have been really hard.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.759
Nah. After the first few blowjobs,
you get used to the taste,

16:15.760 --> 16:19.279
then it's pretty lucrative, really.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.279
That's not true.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.559
Isn't this wicked?

16:45.560 --> 16:48.959
The Bloods and the Cripples
together at last. You get me?

16:48.960 --> 16:51.559
What's he talking about?

16:51.560 --> 16:54.839
Nick's suggesting
that we're a bunch of cripples

16:54.840 --> 16:58.839
and that he and Mini are similar
to a black, violent, LA street gang.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.199
Anyway, I've gotta run, so...

17:09.200 --> 17:11.279
Are you coming to this thing later?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.598
What thing?I didn't know
about a thing.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.598
Meet properly.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.839
Nah, big game tomorrow, so...

17:26.720 --> 17:30.719
Best run.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.239
Officer on deck!

18:01.240 --> 18:03.559
Everyone brought their A game?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.159
A game's the only one I've got.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.159
Glad to hear it, champ!

18:12.840 --> 18:13.399
What's with Liv, man?

18:13.400 --> 18:14.439
What's with Liv, man?
What about her?

18:14.440 --> 18:17.559
That fucking scrawny little
turd-corn she was with.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.199
I thought she was into real men.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.239
She was never into you, Rides.

18:21.240 --> 18:24.279
He was like a sort of
weird little miniature gay.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.639
Surprised the little pecker hasn't
drowned in my sloppy seconds.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.959
Surprised the little pecker hasn't
drowned in my sloppy seconds.
Rider, shut the fuck up, yeah?

18:29.960 --> 18:33.959
Hey, what?
You into her or something?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.159
He's my brother.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.839
Your brother?

18:37.840 --> 18:41.599
Him? He's your brother?

18:41.600 --> 18:44.559
What did they do? Raise the
afterbirth and give it a name?

18:44.560 --> 18:46.119
Rider, that's enough, mate.

18:46.120 --> 18:49.599
All right, skip. Calm down.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.839
Fuck it. He can have
the manky bitch.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.959
Reckon I wore her out last time.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.599
Once old Ride's had his way,
they're ruined.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.799
Rider, one more word
and I'll smack you!

19:00.800 --> 19:04.799
What the fuck, man?
She's not your bird.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.279
What the fuck are you all doing?

19:10.280 --> 19:14.279
We're supposed to be training, yeah?

19:27.680 --> 19:29.799
So, a low contact run.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.559
No big hits, ja?

19:31.560 --> 19:35.039
Work though your moves and give it up
if you're caught, right?

19:35.040 --> 19:36.639
Right?

19:36.640 --> 19:39.839
Play!

19:39.840 --> 19:43.839
Benny's ball!

19:56.320 --> 19:59.319
Jesus Christ, Levan.
What the fuck was that?

19:59.320 --> 20:00.719
Got carried away.

20:00.720 --> 20:04.719
Too fucking right you did!

20:34.560 --> 20:38.559
So... you gonna tell me
what the matter is, then, eh?

20:39.960 --> 20:42.079
I'm just nervous about
the game, coach.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.879
Don't tug me, boy.

20:43.880 --> 20:47.879
You can say what you like,
but muscles never lie.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.719
Argh!

20:50.720 --> 20:53.759
I can read a body like a book, boy,

20:53.760 --> 20:57.759
and this is a depressing book
about an anxious young man.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.639
Argh! Fuck!

21:01.640 --> 21:03.479
Just as I thought.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.359
An anxious young man
who's worrying about a girl.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.879
You know what I think
about those types of books?

21:09.880 --> 21:11.039
No, sir.

21:11.040 --> 21:15.039
They're no good to me
before a big game.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.319
You know...

21:18.320 --> 21:20.159
I've got a brother.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.119
Back in Jo'burg.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.919
I didn't speak to him for ten years.

21:23.920 --> 21:24.799
OK...

21:24.800 --> 21:27.199
OK...
Just shut up and listen, ja?

21:27.200 --> 21:28.999
He was a bastard, right?

21:29.000 --> 21:32.239
Angry, bigoted young man.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.719
I hated his guts, but I...

21:34.720 --> 21:36.879
I don't have a problem
with Matty, coach.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.159
Yes, you do.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.119
I can feel it.

21:41.120 --> 21:45.119
Argh!

22:03.360 --> 22:04.559
Shit!

22:04.560 --> 22:08.519
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.479
OK. Why are you
hanging around outside?

22:10.480 --> 22:14.479
I was about to call you, to see
where you are, if you were coming.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.399
But you're here now, so... ace.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.879
Grace called me.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.879
Nice one. Come on, then.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.919
Feel the love, guys.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.679
Hey, man.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.799
Hey, man.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.799
Hi.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.759
What's the chat?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.999
We're planning how to
find Alo a girlfriend.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.599
Wicked. What's the brief?

22:46.600 --> 22:47.959
The brief?

22:47.960 --> 22:50.879
Yeah. What are you after?

22:50.880 --> 22:53.959
Short-term lover, desperate fuck,
the love of your life?

22:53.960 --> 22:56.439
You've got to set your aim
on your prey,

22:56.440 --> 22:59.399
know their weaknesses,
then... dah, hunt them down.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.479
He's not picky.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.359
I am!

23:02.360 --> 23:03.639
A bit.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.079
Well, not really.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.559
Why not?

23:17.400 --> 23:20.079
here, so why not hook up?
Needs must, right?

23:20.080 --> 23:22.239
Then we'd all be couples.
We could swing and shit.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.439
Then we'd all be couples.
We could swing and shit.
Ew!

23:24.440 --> 23:28.439
I'm going to go to the bar.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.239
I'll give her a hand.

23:32.240 --> 23:36.239
You've got a full pint.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.479
Not any more.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.639
So you and Matty, hey?
How's it going?

24:02.640 --> 24:05.079
Nick, let's not do this.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.159
Do what?

24:06.160 --> 24:07.959
You know what.

24:07.960 --> 24:11.839
I'm just, you know,
checking everything's all right.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.799
That he's, you know...

24:14.800 --> 24:17.359
What?

24:17.360 --> 24:19.999
He smashed up our entire house.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.959
He goes crazy and I don't
want that to happen again.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.399
Not to you.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.639
Oh, yeah. Good one.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.359
I see, you're worried I
might get hurt. That's it.

24:30.360 --> 24:30.719
No...

24:30.720 --> 24:33.279
No...
Nick, what is this?
Have you got a problem

24:35.400 --> 24:39.399
I don't have a problem. I just...
I just wonder what it means for us?

24:40.120 --> 24:44.119
Us? Nick, there is no us.
There never was.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.279
Come on, we had good times.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.679
We fucked... twice. And I wasn't even
fucking you. I was fucking Mini.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.039
I don't know what that means.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.679
No, of course you don't.

24:53.680 --> 24:57.679
Nick, she knows about us
and she's still with you.

24:58.280 --> 25:02.279
Don't you think that's fucked up?

25:02.360 --> 25:04.719
We're fine. Better than ever.

25:04.720 --> 25:08.719
If that's what you think,
then you two deserve each other.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.999
12 sambucas, please, chap.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.719
What the fuck are you doing?

26:32.720 --> 26:35.039
What am I doing?
This is me, is it, my fault?

26:35.040 --> 26:36.559
This isn't cool.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.239
I'm having a good time.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.399
I'm having a good time.
You're out of order.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.319
Why? Cos I danced with
your best mate?

26:40.320 --> 26:40.999
Bruv, leave it.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.479
Bruv, leave it.
Matty, stay out of this.

26:44.400 --> 26:48.399
before she gets horny again
and fucks a passer...

26:53.480 --> 26:57.479
I think you broke my nose!

27:00.960 --> 27:01.999
Mini!

27:02.000 --> 27:04.239
Don't suddenly act like you care.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.559
I do.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.839
If you cared, why did you
fuck my best friend?!

27:07.840 --> 27:08.759
Mins...

27:08.760 --> 27:12.759
Mins...
Fuck you! Fuck you, Nick.

27:16.560 --> 27:20.559
Nick...

27:28.960 --> 27:32.959
Shit!

27:34.920 --> 27:36.439
Shit.

27:45.440 --> 27:49.319
Won't your friends be missing you?

28:30.120 --> 28:32.759
Everything's so fucking easy for you,
isn't it?!

28:32.760 --> 28:35.639
I've worked my arse off,
done everything I'm supposed to,

28:35.640 --> 28:38.559
like nothing happened

28:38.560 --> 28:40.359
and fuck up my life again!

28:40.360 --> 28:44.359
I'm not the one
fucking you up, Nick.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.199
Where the fuck have you been?

29:05.200 --> 29:07.759
Out.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.759
Dad, it's 2am. Where are you going?

29:13.040 --> 29:17.039
Warren's killed himself.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.079
I gave that bastard more time,
care and attention

29:20.080 --> 29:23.159
than any fucker in his life,
and they want to question me?

29:23.160 --> 29:25.519
Give me shit?

29:25.520 --> 29:27.679
All I try and do is help

29:27.680 --> 29:30.519
and I get blamed
when things go wrong.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.839
Blame culture. That's
what's wrong with this country.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.839
Dad, I need to talk to you...

29:40.800 --> 29:43.559
The state of you.

29:43.560 --> 29:46.799
What the fuck are you playing at?

29:46.800 --> 29:48.199
I've had a bad night.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.719
You had a bad night
because you chose to have one!

29:50.720 --> 29:54.719
Or is that my fault too?

29:57.800 --> 29:58.839
Dad, I need...

29:58.840 --> 30:02.039
Fuck's sake, Nick!

30:02.040 --> 30:06.039
Grow up.

30:45.680 --> 30:49.679
Aaaaargh!

30:53.920 --> 30:57.919
Aaaargh!

31:05.880 --> 31:09.879
Nick!

31:12.000 --> 31:15.479
Go.

31:15.480 --> 31:19.479
Go!

32:16.040 --> 32:18.919
Liv!

32:18.920 --> 32:22.919
Liv!

33:05.320 --> 33:07.119
Aaargh!

33:12.080 --> 33:13.799
Nick! What the fuck?!

33:13.800 --> 33:15.759
I need to speak to you.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.119
No, you need to go.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.879
No! Please, Liv.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.879
You're the only one
that understands me.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.919
I need you, Liv.

33:26.920 --> 33:30.919
No, you don't, Nick. I don't know
what you need, but it's not me.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.999
Go home, Nick.

34:22.679 --> 34:25.639
Are you all right?

34:25.639 --> 34:29.319
You look... fucked.

34:31.280 --> 34:35.279
Fucked, I mean. Not all right.

34:35.440 --> 34:39.438
What's your name?

34:42.159 --> 34:46.159
It's Matty.

34:59.280 --> 35:03.279
Who are those children?

35:03.920 --> 35:07.919
They're my kids.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.759
How old are you, Matty?

35:15.760 --> 35:17.239
Old enough.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.239
Can we have some more?

35:21.280 --> 35:23.919
Not now.

35:23.920 --> 35:27.919
I want to feel something, Matty.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.279
What are you doing here?

37:15.280 --> 37:19.279
I live round the corner.

37:35.800 --> 37:39.799
No, I'm good.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.039
You look like shit, you know.

37:43.040 --> 37:47.039
Yeah.

37:47.520 --> 37:51.519
I think I managed to fuck
just about everything up.

37:53.040 --> 37:56.439
You know that I'm...

37:56.440 --> 37:59.119
...that people think I'm...

37:59.120 --> 38:00.399
a dick?

38:06.560 --> 38:09.479
Sometimes I do things
I know I shouldn't

38:09.480 --> 38:13.479
and I do 'em anyway, cos...

38:14.160 --> 38:18.159
Fuck.Why do I do them?

38:19.840 --> 38:23.519
You're not a complete dick.

38:23.520 --> 38:27.519
Thanks.

38:30.680 --> 38:34.679
So, what are you gonna do
now, then?

38:39.680 --> 38:43.679
Well, I'll leave you to it.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.759
You're late, Levan.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.919
I'm not playing.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.199
I can see that.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.999
Ever.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.679
I'm done, that's it.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.639
I need to sort some shit out,
cos if I don't, I'll go crazy

39:18.640 --> 39:22.639
and I'll end up fucked up and alone,
and I can't be like that.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.079
And... and rugby...

39:26.080 --> 39:29.319
rugby... isn't helping,

39:29.320 --> 39:32.719
and actually, I hate it.

39:35.080 --> 39:39.079
and Rider.

39:39.320 --> 39:43.319
I fucking hate Rider.

39:43.360 --> 39:46.119
And I hate...

39:46.120 --> 39:49.119
I hate too much at the moment,
coach, and I need to...

39:49.120 --> 39:52.439
I need to stop.

39:52.440 --> 39:56.439
But I don't hate you, coach,
so I wanted to you know...

39:57.240 --> 39:59.639
Well, if that's the way you feel.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.679
So... what are you going to do about
it?

40:08.440 --> 40:10.919
I'm leaving.

40:10.920 --> 40:14.919
I'm gonna find my brother,
and we're gonna leave. I can't...

40:15.200 --> 40:17.639
We can't be with my dad any more,
coach.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.879
You're gonna run away. That it?

40:19.880 --> 40:21.439
I'm not running away.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.279
Yes, you are!

40:23.280 --> 40:25.759
It's all very well
seeing an injustice, Nick.

40:25.760 --> 40:29.759
That's the easy part.
What you do next is the hard part.
It defines a man.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.439
I can't be happy in that house,
coach!

40:33.440 --> 40:35.799
You want to be happy? That it, ja?

40:37.920 --> 40:41.079
You know who this is?

40:41.080 --> 40:43.159
Yeah, course, but...

40:43.160 --> 40:45.959
He's a happy man, ja? Respected.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.159
Everybody loves Madiba.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.119
He's fair and peaceful and friendly.

40:51.120 --> 40:54.999
But when he was your age,
he was a right angry fucker.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.799
Furious, ja. He blew things up.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.559
Fought and fought and fought
against the shit he came up against.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.999
He never ran away.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.479
They had to lock the bastard away

41:04.480 --> 41:08.479
to try to stop him,
and even then he fought.

41:08.520 --> 41:11.479
I don't know what you're
saying.

41:11.480 --> 41:15.479
I'm saying I thought
you were stronger than someone
who runs, Nick.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.239
Stand up for yourself.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.279
I am.

41:18.280 --> 41:22.279
No, you're not. Just saying...

41:22.920 --> 41:26.359
You're a coward, ja.

41:26.360 --> 41:30.359
Fuck you, coach.

41:35.400 --> 41:39.399
Fucking bottler.

41:42.200 --> 41:46.199
Luck, boys.See you around.

42:03.160 --> 42:07.159
Where are you going?
Put your bag down.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.599
You were supposed to be keeping an
eye on him.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.519
You were supposed to be keeping an
eye on him.
Shut up.

42:12.520 --> 42:15.239
What?

42:15.240 --> 42:18.479
I did it.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.919
Don't believe you.

42:19.920 --> 42:23.919
I don't care what you believe.

42:25.480 --> 42:28.639
I see.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.199
You're standing up for yourself.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.999
Is that it?

42:34.000 --> 42:37.999
He's got to you. I know you, Nick,
and you wouldn't have done shit

42:38.120 --> 42:39.319
if it wasn't for him.No!

42:39.320 --> 42:41.799
I wouldn't have done shit
if it wasn't for you.

42:41.800 --> 42:45.799
None of this would have happened
if you'd just...

42:46.520 --> 42:50.519
Fuck!

42:55.680 --> 42:59.679
Stop being a cunt.

43:06.360 --> 43:10.359
So, what, you... you're ganging up
on me now, are you?

43:17.520 --> 43:20.839
Yeah.

43:20.840 --> 43:24.839
Yes, we are.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.759
Contract.

45:03.640 --> 45:05.439
...Ooooh!

45:05.440 --> 45:07.319
We've decided you're leaving
college.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.199
This is just victimisation.

45:09.200 --> 45:13.199
Reason for leaving?
I'll just put simpleton.

45:13.600 --> 45:17.599
You've gotta stickit to the man,
bruv.

45:20.200 --> 45:24.119
Mum...! Mum...!

45:24.120 --> 45:26.199
Come on then, Dad,
let's have it, shall we?

45:26.200 --> 45:28.639
Let's get naked, go out there

45:28.640 --> 45:32.639
and show those old fuckers
who's boss!
