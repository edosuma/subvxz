-But you gotta do it
one more time.

Okay? Just get me something.

He has a laptop.
I saw it.

We partner up.
You, me, and Mitch.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.434
-Put a casino in the back.
-How much does that cost?

00:33.567 --> 00:35.403
Maybe a half a million bucks
to grease the wheels.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.572
Did you really think you were
the only criminal in Tulsa?

00:38.706 --> 00:40.474
There he is. The General.

How's it going? How's Tulsa?

fuck up Dwight's son-in-law?

You think Dwight
is a better man than I am?

00:51.219 --> 00:52.920
-What?
-It's what you said.

Enough with
this Dwight bullshit.

use the other hand to steady it.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.619

in between the sight,

-Nothing.

very uncomfortable

with the idea
of shooting somebody.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.263
You know
what's more uncomfortable?

02:09.397 --> 02:10.931
Someone shooting you.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.967
You know,
before you came along,

02:14.635 --> 02:16.404
I had never even held
a gun before.

-I got my own style, man.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.852
Didn't you hear
what Mitch said to you?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.754
Got your own style?
You know what your style is?

02:33.887 --> 02:35.623
You're gonna hit
everything except

02:35.756 --> 02:37.191
for what you're aiming at.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.659
Look.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.561
The gun is not made that way.

02:40.694 --> 02:41.962
You hold it sideways,

02:42.095 --> 02:43.597

that way.

John Wayne.

it's kind of a takeoff on it.

like that?

Yeah? It's nice.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.756
So, you had activities together.
Nice.

why we're doing all this?

03:55.769 --> 03:58.238
Are there people after us?
Just very curious.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.974
'Cause the last thing I wanted
to do was shoot a gun again.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.577
It's important to learn
how to defend yourself.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.346
Of course.
But what the fuck did we do

04:05.479 --> 04:06.847

You didn't do anything.

fucking sorry

upside down?

Listen, we're all adults, okay?

when you play

04:39.580 --> 04:40.814
with other people's toys.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.650
So, we're not going anywhere.

That said,
you're a smart guy, our leader.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.357
So, lead us out of this shit.

a moment and think about

04:53.994 --> 04:58.098

the casino license,

like a child. What you mean?

-No? Okay.

and you don't report it

you're part of that crime.

paint a bigger fucking picture?

how am I supposed to stand guard

what I'm guarding against?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.136
They're the same cops
that arrested me

11:43.270 --> 11:44.704
before right there.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.777
Well, there's your answer.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.419
AGENT RUIZ:
So Dwight Manfredi,
as far as we know,

11:59.552 --> 12:00.888
he ain't just passing through.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.890
He and an ex-con,
Mitchell Keller,

12:03.023 --> 12:05.158
have been selling nitrous,
but that led to a clash with--

12:05.292 --> 12:07.127
Black Macadam. We know.
We've been tracking them

12:07.260 --> 12:08.996
for months
for guns and explosives.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.663
It was actually one
of their girlfriends

12:10.798 --> 12:12.099
that brought Manfredi
to our attention.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.334
-Our informant.
-Our murdered informant.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.069
-What happened there?
-ASAC: Well, there's no body

12:16.203 --> 12:17.805
-so we don't--
-Caolan Waltrip killed her.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.540
Waltrip's head of the gang.
Tail turn up anything?

12:20.673 --> 12:24.277
Manfredi? Couple of stops
at Keller's bar, Bred2Buck,

12:24.411 --> 12:26.246
and the weed store
he's partnered in.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.817
He also seems to be dating
someone, a Margaret Devereaux.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.284
Took her to dinner
the other night.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.553
She owns a horse farm,
Fennario Ranch.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.388
There's also some other woman
he's been seen with,

12:35.522 --> 12:37.424
-but we haven't been able to--
-STACY: Okay.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.960
So, basically what you're saying
is the FBI has nothing, right?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.628
I'm sorry, am I wrong?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.931
Why are we wasting our time
on this bullshit

12:44.064 --> 12:46.299
when the fact is there's
a war brewing on the streets

12:46.433 --> 12:48.135
between the most vicious
biker gang in Tulsa

12:48.268 --> 12:50.003
and a fucking nobody
New York gangster?

12:50.137 --> 12:52.472
Manfredi's not even
an ATF target.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.074
We should be focused on Waltrip.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.209
Okay? The fucking murderer
who's trafficking

12:56.343 --> 12:58.078
-in drugs and stolen weapons.
-Stacy.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.048
No. No.
He's got money.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.017
-Like serious money.
-What do you mean?

13:04.151 --> 13:06.319
Roxy, our informant,
told me before she was killed.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.022
-How much we talking?
-STACY: I don't know.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.491
But I'm sure he's not
paying taxes on it.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.226
So, let's go that route.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.627
Could be something there.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.463
STACY:
Guys, it's all we've got.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.866
Let's get this fucking shit head
off the streets

13:18.999 --> 13:21.101
before more people get killed.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.005
MOSS:
Moss Wheelwright, a pleasure.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.907
-DWIGHT: How you doing? Dwight.
-MOSS: All right.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.142
Moss is a bullfighter
these days. Distracts the bull.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.144
Wrangles him
when the rider falls off.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.213
Man, sorry I'm late, brother.
Had to sneak out of work.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.949
-Howdy. Ben Hutchins.
-Hey, Ben. Dwight.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.351
BEN:
Pleasure. Don't mind the blood.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.553
-I work at a slaughterhouse.
-DWIGHT: You're all right.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.223
Look, I told the boys
what we're looking for.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.593
-You guys okay with that?
-I Will kill without remorse.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.128
Amen to that.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.230
You guys start
whenever you want.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.933
Hey, so, you're in the mafia?

13:55.302 --> 13:57.971
Nah, there's no such a thing.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.908
[laughs]

14:01.708 --> 14:03.210
MOSS:
Fucking idiot.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.445
[both laugh]

14:08.415 --> 14:10.817
This is the last of it
right here.

14:20.127 --> 14:24.164
-Ma ain't gon' come say bye?
-She, uh...

14:25.365 --> 14:28.768
She can't.
She's crying.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.870
Why it's gotta be like that?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.006
You'll understand
when you have a kid.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.474
If you have a kid.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.076
Of course I'm gonna have a kid.

14:36.776 --> 14:40.213
You know the hardest thing
about being a father?

14:41.548 --> 14:45.818
Standing by,
watching your kid get hurt.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.022
We take you to the playground,

14:49.156 --> 14:51.291
you-- you be high up
on that jungle gym,

14:51.424 --> 14:55.262
10 feet in the air, and my heart
would be in my throat.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.032
-That was fun, right? Dad?
-Yeah. You were, son.

14:59.166 --> 15:04.337
What you doing now,
this ain't no playground.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.439
What you talking about?
I'm too old for playground.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.410
But still young enough
to make bad choices.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.513
-Dad.
-But we don't have
to debate this, Tyson.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.949
You made your decision.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.519
We did our best.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.357
I'm gon' be all right.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.559
God bless you, son.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.835
[car engine rumbling]

15:45.678 --> 15:48.815
-Thanks a lot, my friend.
-See you tomorrow, cuz.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.584
Cuz?
[chuckles]

15:53.086 --> 15:58.125
-[phone ringing]
-Tina.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.027
So, I've been thinking about
what you said, you know,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.229
about us coming to Oklahoma,
and...

16:03.696 --> 16:05.765
I think a change of scenery
would be nice.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.935
DWIGHT:
Yeah. No, it's exciting.

16:09.069 --> 16:13.340
But I think we gotta put
a pin in it at the moment.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.775
TINA:
Is everything okay?

16:15.908 --> 16:17.744
DWIGHT:
No, it's not that.

16:17.877 --> 16:21.448
Every-- everything is fine.
It's just that I gotta get

16:21.581 --> 16:24.184
things together.
I wanna get the right room.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.053
I want the kids
to be comfortable.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.820
Maybe we should slow
things down anyway

16:27.954 --> 16:32.125
because, for all intents
and purposes, we did just meet.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.760
DWIGHT:
Yeah.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.328
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

16:35.462 --> 16:40.400
Tina, I really wanna meet
my grandkids.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.670
Yeah, you will.
When the time is right.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.173
DWIGHT:
Okay.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.508
That's good. Please call me.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.144
And stay safe.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.547
Will do. Bye.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.417
I love you. Bye.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.890
[tense music playing]

17:10.430 --> 17:12.132
STACY:
Where's Caolan Waltrip?

17:12.499 --> 17:13.733
Fuck do I know?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.268
How about Robbie Trucotte?

17:15.402 --> 17:17.204
-At his house, I guess.
-Yeah. Where's that?

17:17.337 --> 17:20.373
Trailer park off Elwood.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.348
STACY:
Kyra. I'll take that.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.618
Thank you.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.630
MARGARET:
Glad someone's riding him.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.665
DWIGHT:
Hey.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.002
-Dwight Manfredi.
-Yeah.

17:50.137 --> 17:53.106
Brian Gillen,
the former Mr. Devereaux.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.043
Yeah. It's a nice animal.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.679
Could be good
for PATH certification.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.381
That's therapeutic horsemanship.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.949
You mean like a service animal?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.917
BRIAN:
Yeah, that's what I meant. Yeah.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.320
That'd be a tough thing to get
on an airplane, wouldn't it?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.789
[chuckles]
That's for sure.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.959
RICHIE:
Hey, Peg,
Javier's looking for you.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.795
I'll be right back.

18:21.100 --> 18:25.238
Yeah. That Peggy,
she's a-- she's quite a gal.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.774
Yeah. She's a lovely lady.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.543
And I trust
that you're being respectful.

18:31.344 --> 18:37.150
'Cause I know your, um,
type, really big on respect.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.951
Is there a problem?

18:39.085 --> 18:41.154
Yeah. Let's just cut the crap,
shall we?

18:41.588 --> 18:42.889
I know what you're up to.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.793
You found a woman of means
and you're fixin' to fleece her.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.196
Not for nothing.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.799
But you don't know
nothing about me.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.935
You don't think
I don't know who you are?

18:56.903 --> 18:59.972
You-- you-- you-- you--
you're a fucking relic.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.142
I mean, you-- with all
your-- your tough talk

19:03.276 --> 19:05.278
and your shiny shoes.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.079
But here's the thing.

19:07.214 --> 19:11.284
That dog,
it just don't hunt down here.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.287
Maybe it don't hunt,
but it fucking bites.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.756
[both laugh]

19:16.889 --> 19:19.892
You are funny, Manfredi.
You are. You are.

19:20.993 --> 19:25.198
You know, I've--
I've faced down carpetbaggers,

19:25.332 --> 19:28.635
wildcatters,
cattlemen, the Klan.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.339
So, you'll forgive me
if I don't exactly quake

19:32.472 --> 19:35.908
at the prospect of being
at loggerheads with you.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.346
Hey.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.484
Well,
I'll leave you two to catch up.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.854
[birds chirping]

19:49.856 --> 19:53.893
-Nice guy.
-Ah, you think so? Hmm.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.062
Here I thought you were
a good judge of character.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.031
-Actually, he's an asshole.
-[laughs]

19:59.165 --> 20:02.935
I mean, I understand that love
can be a temporary form

20:03.069 --> 20:05.272
of insanity
and I don't want to embar--

20:05.405 --> 20:07.240
I mean, you know what?
I don't care.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.477
Wanna say that you had to be
out of your fucking mind

20:10.610 --> 20:11.811
to marry that bum,
just saying.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.614
-Really.
-Yeah. Maybe.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.750
Well, I'm thinking
quite clear now.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.821
Would you care
to stay for lunch?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.824
I'm starving.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.994
-[laughs]
-Jesus.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.497
-Holy shit.
-ASAC: How in the hell

20:30.630 --> 20:32.299
did this guy get so much money?

20:32.432 --> 20:34.767
He's flushing profits through
the global financial market.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.970
STACY:
I mean, this fucker's
into everything.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.706
Internet party platforms,

20:39.839 --> 20:41.474
crypto, credit cards,
real estate.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.943
AGENT WATTERS:
We need to freeze
these accounts.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.812
That means a court order.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.747
STACY:
Yeah. That could take days.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.549
Can we get a rush on that?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.418
ASAC:
Can't hurt to try.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.788
[ominous music playing]

20:57.324 --> 20:59.025
I take it you heard about
the raid?

20:59.158 --> 21:00.560
OFFICER WEATHERWAX:
I have.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.228
I'm sorry.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.364
CAOLAN: Well, your pity
doesn't really do much

21:04.497 --> 21:06.065
for me now, does it?

21:06.198 --> 21:07.700
OFFICER WEATHERWAX:
The ATF's federal, Caolan.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.168
There's nothing
we could've done.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.770
Well, it's not what
you could have done,

21:10.903 --> 21:12.905
it's what you're gonna do now.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.908
I want Manfredi.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.478
We're on the clock, Caolan.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.047
[sniffs]

21:21.714 --> 21:25.051
All right. You listen to me,
you fucking shit stain.

21:25.184 --> 21:28.355
You're not gonna need that job
once I slit your fucking throat.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.990
Arrest Manfredi,
get him into a jail cell,

21:31.123 --> 21:33.259
somewhere I can get to him.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.994
Arrest him for what?

21:36.228 --> 21:38.631
You're a corrupt fucking cop.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.433
Think of something.

21:46.138 --> 21:50.109
Man, why I gotta get
in this casino racket, huh?

21:50.242 --> 21:51.578
With Dwight?

21:52.479 --> 21:57.283
Well, since throwing
in with Mr. Manse,

21:57.417 --> 22:03.456
I have been co-opted,
abducted, raided by the Feds.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.725
JIMMY:
But?

22:06.359 --> 22:09.662
He's a force multiplier,
no question.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.298
So, I gotta go
to the Great White Father?

22:12.432 --> 22:16.836
For what, a fuckin' grubstake
in the minestrone mint?

22:17.269 --> 22:20.139
I mean, you're already
doing business with him. Right?

22:23.410 --> 22:25.878
In for a penny,
in for a pound.

22:29.982 --> 22:33.219
Fuck it, in for a pound.

I'mma go by Starbucks.

Oh, what the fuck is that?

Take your fucking hand
out from under your jacket.

Do it.

All right.
Listen up, carefully.

a fucking. 357 Magnum

that will leave a hole

you could put your fucking
fist through.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.505
You wanna see
your loved ones tonight?

23:25.638 --> 23:30.176
I want you to rethink
whatever stupid, ill-conceived

23:30.309 --> 23:35.281
idea that moronic biker
is putting you up to.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.985
Get in your car, put it in gear,

23:40.487 --> 23:42.254
and drive the fuck away.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.726
We know where to find you.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.961
That goes both ways.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.916
So, what was that about?

24:11.984 --> 24:14.453
[chuckles]
Broken taillight.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.056
I forgot my gun back
at the hotel.

24:29.702 --> 24:30.903
You're a nice guy.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.439
But if I wasn't mandated
to be here,

24:33.573 --> 24:36.075
you would never
fucking see me again.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.746
Well, forgive me for stating
the obvious, but that sounds

24:39.879 --> 24:43.315
like someone who wants to avoid
discussing their problems.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.886
No.
I'm handling my problems.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.655
With alcohol?

24:49.155 --> 24:51.624
By getting shit done.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.493
Care to elaborate?

24:56.028 --> 24:57.463
Not really.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.568
Paco Rabanne man?

25:01.701 --> 25:03.703
The one who reminded you
of your father?

25:06.105 --> 25:07.373
Have you seen him again?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.143
Please tell me that's not
in my personnel file.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.045
EVAN:
It's not.

25:13.813 --> 25:16.616
But it sounds like
you're veering into behavior

25:16.749 --> 25:18.718
that could cost you your career.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.022
I appreciate your concern.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.593
That's over. It is done.

25:27.126 --> 25:30.597
[phone ringing]

25:32.364 --> 25:35.167
-How you doing?
-CHICKIE: Uncle Dwight?

25:36.102 --> 25:37.203
You there?

25:37.336 --> 25:39.138
Thank you for picking up.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.642
-Of course.
-CHICKIE: So, listen.

25:43.810 --> 25:44.844
You probably know

25:44.977 --> 25:46.613
we buried my dad yesterday.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.782
Yeah. I'm sorry for your loss
and condolences.

25:49.916 --> 25:53.085
But I'm not a hypocrite either,
Chickie.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.657
Man tried to have me killed
on the inside.

25:58.124 --> 26:02.494
-CHICKIE: Dwight.
-25 years of my life, gone.

26:02.629 --> 26:03.996
CHICKIE:
Dwight.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.064
I get it.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.300
I'm calling because
I wanna move past all that.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.804
We have to for the sake
of our future.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.806
Okay. I'm listening.

26:13.940 --> 26:17.944
CHICKIE: The infighting,
the arguing, all the bad blood.

26:18.611 --> 26:21.447
I mean, what kind of message
are we sending in-house?

26:22.081 --> 26:24.283
Not to mention
it makes us look weak

26:24.416 --> 26:25.752
in front of the other families.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.286
If we're gonna survive,

26:27.987 --> 26:30.056
you and me,
we gotta make amends.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.058
And how do you suggest
we do that?

26:32.191 --> 26:34.093
CHICKIE:
Along with my dad,

26:34.226 --> 26:37.429
we bury the hatchet,
all this nonsense between us.

26:38.197 --> 26:42.468
Vince, Nico, whatever
you got going on with Armand.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.271
Honestly, I don't give a shit.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.709
That's all behind us
as of right now.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.980
Yesterday, watching them
lower my father's casket

26:54.113 --> 26:58.550
into the ground, you know
what I realized, Uncle Dwight?

26:59.986 --> 27:02.388
You are the last vestige

27:02.521 --> 27:05.624
of my father that I got left.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.095
I'm coming to visit.

27:09.796 --> 27:10.997
Me, Vince, Goodie.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.232
We have dinner, we break bread.

27:13.365 --> 27:17.403
We show everybody
that we are unified.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.806
I don't know
if that's necessary.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.240
No, no. I-- I-- I want to.

27:21.373 --> 27:24.343
We need closure here.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.149
Okay.
You know where to find me.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.685
CHICKIE:
You take care of yourself.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.187
I'll see you soon.

27:42.061 --> 27:47.433
And the Oscar goes to...
Chickie Invernizzi.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.837
[clapping]

27:51.704 --> 27:53.105
Fuck that piece of shit.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.007
CAOLAN:
Did you get him?

27:55.141 --> 27:56.542
OFFICER WEATHERWAX:
We couldn't find him.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.277
The fuck does that mean?

27:58.410 --> 28:00.880
OFFICER WEATHERWAX:
Didn't happen. He's not around.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.081
[sniffs]

28:02.214 --> 28:05.151
You told me
you know where he lives.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.586
He wasn't there.
What do you want me to tell you?

28:08.120 --> 28:12.091
Incompetent piece of shit!

28:12.558 --> 28:14.060
OFFICER WEATHERWAX:
We'll keep looking, Caolan.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.129
-I'm sorry.
-Fuck it! Don't bother.

28:23.669 --> 28:25.337
Fuck!

28:33.145 --> 28:35.247
ARMAND:
Well?

28:36.983 --> 28:40.719
-Are these sardines in here?
-It's Sicilian.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.488
You like it?

28:44.857 --> 28:46.592
It's good. Yeah.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.195
It's interesting.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.602
Why were you so late tonight?

28:57.970 --> 29:02.474
-Just work stuff.
-Yeah. How is work?

29:02.608 --> 29:04.376
You haven't talked
about that lately.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.412
Fine, you know.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.282
Roxy quit.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.886
-What?
-She's gone. I don't know.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.656
Just stopped showing up.
Nobody knows where she is.

29:18.624 --> 29:20.492
Peggy's a little freaked.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.902
Hey, have you talked to that--

29:31.103 --> 29:33.672
that friend of yours recently?
That one in Boise?

29:34.974 --> 29:36.976
Del Holland? No. Why?

29:37.109 --> 29:40.079
Just wondering if that job
could still be available.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.349
We talked about this, Clara.
We're not moving.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.717
I know.
But I've been thinking about--

29:45.852 --> 29:48.487
-Stop thinking!
-Just listen to me.

29:49.856 --> 29:52.191
This isn't what I already
know happened. Okay?

29:52.324 --> 29:55.561
This-- this is about not knowing
what is gonna happen tomorrow.

29:55.694 --> 29:58.397
Nobody knows
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

29:58.530 --> 30:01.100
-Stop yelling.
-I'm not-- they can't hear me.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.969
They got their VR headsets on.

30:05.838 --> 30:07.940
Better a virtual reality
than this one.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.508
[fork clatters]

30:09.641 --> 30:12.078
Oh, your life's so bad?
Really?

30:12.912 --> 30:14.446
I don't know.
You tell me.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.116
You know, when I came through
the living room earlier

30:17.249 --> 30:19.551
and our two beautiful children
were sitting there watching TV,

30:19.685 --> 30:21.153
I actually stopped

30:21.287 --> 30:24.356
and I made sure that the shades
were pulled down.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.258
Why?
There's nobody watching us.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.460
-Nobody's-- no?
-No.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.096
No?
That monster wasn't watching us

30:30.229 --> 30:31.730
before he came into our house

30:31.864 --> 30:33.299
and put a fucking gun
to your head?

30:33.432 --> 30:35.334
That's over. Okay?

30:35.467 --> 30:38.204
Why? What?
'Cause you're buddies now?

30:39.305 --> 30:43.742
Jesus, Manny, you come home
at all hours of the night.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.878
Now you're carrying
a fucking gun.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.514
Your-- your coworkers
are going missing.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.182
Clara, I said enough!

30:50.849 --> 30:53.019
Okay?
We're not moving.

30:53.152 --> 30:56.788
We're not fucking running.
You hear me?

31:00.159 --> 31:01.760
Who the fuck are you?

31:01.894 --> 31:03.629
I should never come here
in the first place.

31:03.762 --> 31:04.964
That's who the fuck I am.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.832
I should have stayed
in Brooklyn.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.035
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.370
You know what I mean.
It's nothing to do with you.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.539
It's just, there comes a time,
Clara,

31:13.672 --> 31:16.075
you gotta stand up
for yourself, you know?

31:17.843 --> 31:19.011
Fine.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.681
Yeah. Great. Okay.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.384
Yeah,
you are absolutely right.

31:27.453 --> 31:30.422
So, this is me standing up
for myself.

31:31.757 --> 31:34.626
We either leave here
or we get divorced.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.001
What?

31:42.768 --> 31:45.504
I married a decent man,
I did not marry a criminal.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.707
And I will not raise
my children with one.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.546
[clattering]

31:58.684 --> 32:01.553
Find another place
to sleep tonight or we will.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.828
[clock ticking]

32:09.962 --> 32:12.498
-[car door slams]
-Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.133
You got it, boss.

STACY:
Dwight.

32:17.970 --> 32:22.741
Hey, what are you doing here?

32:22.874 --> 32:24.410
Just wanna let you know

32:24.543 --> 32:26.178
that we raided Waltrip
this morning.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.480
What?
You're bringing him in?

32:28.614 --> 32:30.549
No, he wasn't there.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.951
-So, where is he?
-I don't know.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.054
But there's a warrant out
for him and his lieutenant,

32:35.187 --> 32:37.489
Robbie Trucotte.
They're in the wind.

32:37.856 --> 32:40.026
-Hmm.
-Listen to me.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.893
All right? It's over.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.196
Wherever the fuck he is,

32:44.330 --> 32:46.832
just let him stay there
and go on with your life.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.701
I'll do my best.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.372
Yeah. I'm not sure
your best is good enough.

32:54.006 --> 32:57.709
I finally got the FBI to get off
this, so just move on.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.113
So, how you doing?

33:01.780 --> 33:04.583
How am I doing?
What does that mean?

33:04.716 --> 33:06.585
Would you like to come
upstairs for a drink?

33:07.253 --> 33:10.889
The balls on this guy.
Are you fucking serious?

33:11.023 --> 33:12.858
I'm seriously serious.
Why not?

33:12.991 --> 33:14.826
Why not? 'Cause you and I
are not a thing.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.129
Do you not remember when I told
you to fuck off last time?

33:17.263 --> 33:20.532
-You didn't mean that.
-Yeah, I did.

33:21.033 --> 33:25.171
-Not to mention the-- huh.
-Mention what?

33:26.772 --> 33:28.307
-But what?
-Nothing.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.908
Nothing?
What were you gonna say?

33:30.042 --> 33:31.677
-I heard you have a girlfriend.
-You jealous?

33:31.810 --> 33:33.445
-No, I'm not.
-A little bit?

33:33.945 --> 33:35.914
-Hmm? No.
-Are you sure?

33:36.048 --> 33:37.616
You're so full of yourself.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.218
-Not full of myself.
-Yes!

33:39.351 --> 33:40.486
Is there anything wrong

33:40.619 --> 33:42.321
with being a little human here?

33:42.454 --> 33:43.855
-I mean--
-I don't know.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.524
I guess that's up for debate.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.626
Listen,
I don't wanna be with you.

33:47.759 --> 33:49.428
I just wanna move on
with my life.

I was just up the road.

The fucking thing, just hide it.

anytime, they take him out.
