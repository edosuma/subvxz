Oh, my god, I'm sorry.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.240
I...I didn't see it.
I didn't see him.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.360
Do you know this dog?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
Oh, shit!
Is it yours?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.840
Oh, my god, no.
I didn't see him.

03:28.880 --> 03:29.880
Just didn't...
That's OK.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.160
I live just, um...

03:31.200 --> 03:32.320

Oh, wait, I know a vet.

Oh, great.
No, I can't call her.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.680
What? Why?
Wait, wait, you know what?

03:36.720 --> 03:38.400
I'll text her.
Why don't you just call her?

03:38.440 --> 03:40.720
No, no, it's complicated.
I...we...just hang on.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.960
Sorry, ma'am, do you know this dog?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.280
Is he in the area?
No, no.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.680
Goodness, what happened?

03:45.720 --> 03:48.200
Ah, this man just hit it.
It was an accident.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.640

03:49.680 --> 03:50.680
Excuse me?

by your phones, don't you?

tit at me, actually.

Oh, fuck! You are!

04:15.040 --> 04:16.959
Hey, can that not be the story?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.800
Sorry, what...what story?

04:18.840 --> 04:22.240
What you said to the old lady,
that thing that I...

04:22.280 --> 04:24.160
Oh, the...the...yeah.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.880
..um, before you hit the dog.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.040
I mean, that...that
sort of is what happened, isn't it?

04:31.080 --> 04:33.320
I mean, because...
Yeah.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.600
..because if that's not the story,

04:34.640 --> 04:37.760
then what,
I'm just a terrible driver?

04:37.800 --> 04:42.480
Yeah, I mean, but who cares?

04:42.520 --> 04:43.640
I care.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.960
Oh.
Yeah.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.000
Just say that you got distracted

04:51.040 --> 04:52.800
and you thought
I was someone famous or something.

04:52.840 --> 04:53.880
Right.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.240
It's just a light sedative
for the pain.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.520
Given him oxygen for the shock.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.720
He's only about four years old,
no collar, no tags,

05:09.760 --> 05:12.400
so you've got yourself a stray here.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.040
The x-ray shows
significant spinal damage.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.840
He's...he's gonna survive,
though?

05:16.880 --> 05:18.040
Right?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.360
Well, I mean, it's hard to say.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.960
He's been struck by a car,
so we're not...

05:22.000 --> 05:25.320
Barely struck.
I mean, it was more of a nudge.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.560
Could you tell that to his spine?

05:27.600 --> 05:28.760
Oh, OK.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.360
Ah, what is the best case
scenario here?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.160
He'll be a high-needs dog.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.920
You may need to manually
express his bladder and bowels

05:37.960 --> 05:39.320
if he's not going regularly.

05:39.360 --> 05:43.640
What, like manually force
it out of him...fucken hell.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.360
It's also highly likely that
he'll need wheels for back legs.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.920
Ha! Wheels?

05:47.960 --> 05:49.440
Yes, wheels.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.840
Sounds like
it's going to be pretty expensive.

05:51.880 --> 05:52.920
Is it?

05:52.960 --> 05:54.880
It is.
OK.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.920
Um...are you able to do...

05:56.960 --> 05:58.720
can we do like some mates rates,
or...

05:58.760 --> 06:00.000
Mm.
Oh, yeah, I can do mates rates.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.240
Mm.
Oh, yeah, I can do mates rates.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.360
Great.
That's awesome.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
Yeah. Yeah. For my mates.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.960
Are we mates again, Gordon?

06:08.400 --> 06:09.440
Are you mates?

06:10.800 --> 06:11.840
She's saying no.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.360
I don't know, she might be saying...

06:13.400 --> 06:14.520
No, that's a no.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.320
Right.
OK?

06:16.360 --> 06:18.600
So, if you do treat him,
and then you put him in a shelter,

06:18.640 --> 06:20.000
he's not going to make it.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.920
So, your other option today

06:21.960 --> 06:23.520
is obviously
you can have him put down,

06:23.560 --> 06:25.760
and then you and you girlfriend
can go back to whatever...

06:25.800 --> 06:27.160
No, no, we're not together.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.480
We're not together. No.
At all.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.480
No, I just...I...I saw...
I got distracted by her

06:31.520 --> 06:33.920
when I was driving a car,
because she was...

06:33.960 --> 06:37.320
she was looking to me
like Lindsay Lohan.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.840
Sorry, are you two telling me that

06:40.880 --> 06:42.160
you've just met for the first time?

06:42.200 --> 06:44.080
Yes! Absolutely.
Yes. Just a...yeah.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.360
Don't really know each other at all.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.800
Just today.
Whatever.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.880
I'm going to give you
a couple of minutes to decide.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.240
Fucken hell.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.200
Sorry, mate,
did you hit her dog too?

06:56.240 --> 06:57.360
No, we dated for a while.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, that's...pretty clear.
Lindsay Lohan?

07:00.000 --> 07:00.960
Yeah, that's...pretty clear.
Lindsay Lohan?

07:01.000 --> 07:06.200
Yeah, look,
I...I hate to say this,

07:06.240 --> 07:09.200
but I mean, we...we have
to put him down, don't we?

07:09.240 --> 07:10.320
Fuck, this is a nightmare.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.160
Well, I can't keep him. Can you?

07:12.200 --> 07:13.680
No. No.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.960
My situation is...why can't you?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.160
I run a business.
I'm never home. I can't.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.840
If you run the business
you can take the dog...

07:20.880 --> 07:22.080
I can't have a dog.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.400
No, 'cause that means

07:25.440 --> 07:26.840
that we will have
killed a dog today.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.480
Oh, no! No.
We've killed a dog today!

07:31.360 --> 07:33.560
Sorry.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.680
OK, what's the plan?

07:35.720 --> 07:39.320
I mean, I think...I think
we have to really put him to sleep.

07:41.160 --> 07:45.360
OK, then. Lisa! Room B!

07:48.160 --> 07:49.880
Should we stay?
I think, we should stay.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.480
Yeah, yeah, we should stay.
We'll stay with him.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.560
Yeah, we should...
Be nice.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.000
Don't...I don't think
that's...Sorry.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.920
Oh, I'm so sorry
for your loss today.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.440
No, that's alright.
He's not our dog.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.000
I'm just wondering what kind of urn

08:00.000 --> 08:00.760
I'm just wondering what kind of urn

08:00.800 --> 08:02.000
you might be interested in?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.600
Oh, no, no, no...
I think, we don't need that.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.240
We've got rosewood.
That's really elegant.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.480
No.
Um, ash.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.720
That's quite popular.
Oh, good.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.120
Will you be wanting
a print of the animal's paw?

08:11.160 --> 08:12.640
They make a lovely tattoo...

08:12.680 --> 08:14.000
Sorry, do we have to do this now?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.200
We need a decision prior
to incineration.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.320
Incineration.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.400
No thanks.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.640
OK, here we go.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.600
Stop it!

08:32.000 --> 08:33.320
Sorry about this.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.520
Don't worry about it.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.080
I'll take...
I'll take care of him.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.120
Cool, cool.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.919
It won't...won't be a burden.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.160
It's fine.
Yep.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.320
It was just really intense...

08:48.360 --> 08:50.360
So, as you can see,
this is just an estimate...

08:50.400 --> 08:51.600
Oh, so you do have a normal voice.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.440
Yes.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.360
You're looking at around $12,000.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.720
$12,000? It's a dog!

09:00.760 --> 09:01.840
That's a lot.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.680
Is this...this is the...

09:04.720 --> 09:06.600
this is only if he makes it though,
yeah?

09:06.640 --> 09:07.680
Is there another rate?

09:07.720 --> 09:10.560
No, it's either way.
Just be back around four.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.880
Why? But why?
Surely you don't...do we need...

09:14.560 --> 09:16.240
How long's it's going to take you
to pay this back?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.640
Not long, no.
I'll do a GoFundMe or something.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.400
Yeah, and I'll take care of him.
I'm sorry.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.960
GoFundMe's are great.
Yes!

09:23.000 --> 09:24.600
Yeah, we did one to take my mum

09:24.640 --> 09:26.440
to an euthanasia hotel
in Switzerland.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.200
It covered everything.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.240
Sorry to interrupt.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.840
Um, so you...you can meet me
back here at four?

09:32.880 --> 09:34.520
Yeah.
OK, cool.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.960
And what was your name, by the way?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.120
Um, Ashley.
Sorry to do this.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.280
What are you doing?
Don't film me.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.400
No, I'm not filming,
it's just a photo.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.480
Actually, could I film you?

09:40.520 --> 09:42.480
You just say, "My name is Ashley,
and I was responsible"...

09:42.520 --> 09:43.840
Well no, I'm not...
.."for part"...

09:43.880 --> 09:45.680
No.
No, I don't. I trust you.

09:45.720 --> 09:46.800
It's fine.
Yeah.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.760
12,000.
Do we have her details as well?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.440
No.
Don't need 'em. Just me.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.680
Cool. Um...Alright, 4:00. Good.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.080
I'm sorry, I'm Flash, by the way.
Should have said.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.200
She called you Gordon.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.440
Yeah, I mean my name's Gordon,

09:58.480 --> 09:59.640
but everyone just calls me Flash.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.000
Flash Gordon. Flash.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.720
Flash Gordon. Flash.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.240
I don't know what that is.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.480
Flash Gordon?
Yeah?

10:03.520 --> 10:04.520
He's the comic book hero.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.960
Flash. You know, Flash Gordon.

Sorry, you guys can go.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.400
(GROOVY MUSIC)

10:16.840 --> 10:19.600
She showed you her boob
on the street for no reason?

10:19.640 --> 10:20.760
Yes.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.200
Whole boob? Side boob? Nipple?

10:23.240 --> 10:24.480
It was actually mostly nipple.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.640
Whoa.
Mm.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.800
So, not much under-boob.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.360
Not that I remember.
Dang.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.440
Yeah, I know.
What was it like?

10:30.480 --> 10:32.120
Brett, I've literally never seen you

10:32.160 --> 10:33.400
so interested in anything.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.160
There was a car on fire
outside last week

10:35.200 --> 10:36.360
and you didn't notice.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.480
Yeah, I saw it.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.040
Right, yeah.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.360
What's happening with the dog, then?

10:40.400 --> 10:41.560
OK, so with the dog.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.680
Alright, so dream scenario,

10:43.720 --> 10:46.120
he dies peacefully
and karma's good to me.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
Right.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.960
So, I guess you're pulling
from the business, then.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.760
So, yes, with that, we are down...
Mm?

10:51.800 --> 10:55.040
..temporarily about ah, $12,000.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.240
How many thousands?

10:57.520 --> 10:58.600
12.
Fuck me!

10:58.640 --> 11:00.000
No, no, no,
but it's this girl...this woman,

11:00.000 --> 11:00.680
No, no, no,
but it's this girl...this woman,

11:00.720 --> 11:01.720
she's paying me back.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.400
Yes, because exhibitionists

11:03.440 --> 11:05.000
are known
for being fiscally responsible.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.120
No, she said she'd pay me back.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.360
Hey...
Oh, yes, she said it, did she?

11:07.400 --> 11:10.960
Hey, Chi. Chi.
Don't get mad at him today, OK?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.360
It's a magical day for you.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.480
It's a gland.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.240
It is a real boob, in real life,

11:16.280 --> 11:17.680
that he ordinarily
wouldn't have seen.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.040
Yes.
It never happens.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.640
It's very special.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.400
Thank you.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.160
You're welcome.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.040
I'm going to do something
somewhere else now.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.640
She doesn't get it.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.600
Alright,
a little bit of hush please.

11:34.640 --> 11:35.800
Some focus, some focus.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.160
Alright, so we're moving on
to the golf lift.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.320
It's characterised
by a raised leg at the back...

11:43.520 --> 11:47.840
as you hinge down
to pick up small objects only.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.400
Alright, it might be a pen.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.600
And that's,
and I cannot stress enough,

11:51.640 --> 11:53.400
that you can still do
a lot of damage

11:53.440 --> 11:54.600
just picking up a lot of pen.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.720
Isn't that right, Sonia?

11:57.360 --> 11:58.400
Didn't listen.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.600
A shame.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.840
Alright, alright,
let's get to work, everybody.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.560
Come on, come on, let's move.
Come on.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.040
Is he cute?

12:08.080 --> 12:11.120
Yeah, but his back legs are fucked.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.680
No, the guy.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.840
Oh, yeah, he is pretty cute.
I mean, a bit older.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.040
Maybe more your thing.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.320
That's it. Very good.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.000
I just thought it was off
that when I was like,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.880
"I'll pay you back", he wasn't like,
"Hey, half is fine."

12:22.920 --> 12:25.120
Like he actually hit the dog.
Mm.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.400
Do you know what I mean?
Was it your party tit?

12:27.440 --> 12:29.280
Not even. It was the small one.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.840
So, I think, James
has blocked my number.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.200
Well, good. He sucks.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.680
What if I got a new SIM card
and I was just like, "Hey man!

12:36.720 --> 12:39.320
"Phone troubles, Ra-Ra-Ra.
How are...how are you?"

12:39.360 --> 12:40.720
Don't do that again, Ash.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.360
Was that weird? Yeah.
Ashley?

12:42.400 --> 12:45.040
So, you were late today,
so I'm going to have to get you

12:45.080 --> 12:46.400
to stay back, do some rounds.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.040
Oh, that's OK. I can until four.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.600
Oh, no I can't, actually at all.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.680
Why?

12:52.760 --> 12:55.120
Full disco,
I had some alcohol earlier.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.760
Late and intoxicated.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.840
No, I'm not intoxicated...

12:58.880 --> 13:00.000
And full disco, Ashley,
it's going to have to go on report.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.400
And full disco, Ashley,
it's going to have to go on report.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.520
OK.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.080
Oh, you student doctors,

13:05.120 --> 13:07.160
you really think
you're the chosen ones, don't you?

13:08.360 --> 13:10.440
Alright, thank you everybody.
We're done.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.360
Very good work.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.440
(FART SOUND)

13:13.480 --> 13:14.560
(LAUGHTER)

13:17.720 --> 13:19.600
Oh, god, don't be puerile.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.200
Come on. Go on, go on.
Do you know what?

13:22.240 --> 13:25.040
You can go up to pathology
and pick up some files for me.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.960
Oh, no, Gene,
don't...don't make her.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.040
I can do it.
Can...

13:28.080 --> 13:30.280
No. No, no, no.
No, I need you down here, Megan.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.000
No, she can do it.
Off you go, Ashley.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.160
Come on, hooroo!

13:36.920 --> 13:38.400
Say hello to James for me.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.320
Come on, off you go.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.200
Sonia, I'm not carrying you.
Come on, off you go.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.880
Much longer?

13:54.920 --> 13:56.320
No. Found it.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.760
Hey, did you call my mum again
this morning?

13:59.800 --> 14:00.000
No.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.040
No.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.600
That's weird,
'cause she said you did.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.640
Mm?

14:04.680 --> 14:06.760
Well no, I think
she called me, 'cause...

14:06.800 --> 14:07.880
Oh, OK.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.160
..we have our own relationship.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.400
Yeah, well, she doesn't think so.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.160
Well,
tell her to stop calling me, then.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.320
OK, I will.
Well, you don't.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.800
I'll mention it to her
next time we talk.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.600
Mm-hm.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.720
Look, I hate to have to
do this, Ash,

14:22.760 --> 14:25.840
but don't make up reasons
to visit me at work.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.080
Today is your study day.
You're not even on the ward.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.440
Yeah, I know,
but I came in for OH and S training

14:30.480 --> 14:32.280
and then farty Gene
sent me up here...

14:32.320 --> 14:33.440
Mm.
..didn't he?

14:33.480 --> 14:35.600
Sure.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.920
But, you know,
since I'm here anyway,

14:41.960 --> 14:44.760
I was...did you still want me
to come to your cousin's wedding?

14:46.440 --> 14:48.760
In...in Bali?

14:49.760 --> 14:51.040
'Cause we haven't
talked about it yet,

14:51.080 --> 14:52.680
and I've never been to Bali.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.320
Yeah, well, I just don't...

14:55.360 --> 14:57.200
It's fine. Like, I don't care.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.000
Well, tell Shannon to get me off
the hen's thread, then.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.920
Well, tell Shannon to get me off
the hen's thread, then.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.640
Yeah.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.440
Yeah, I think,
I'll let my family know

15:05.480 --> 15:07.320
it'll just be me.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.880
Will it?

15:08.920 --> 15:09.960
Mm.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.600
I did get a sale fare, though,
so don't be weird if you see me.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.240
Please, please don't come.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.360
Please.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.440
Bye, James.

15:30.240 --> 15:35.240
Mm, well, our deepest sympathies.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.440
Yes.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.320
Could you excuse me just one moment?

15:38.360 --> 15:39.640
Mm.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.040
Ah, sorry,
could you not play with that ball?

15:42.080 --> 15:43.120
That's for the cats.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.000
Oh, I'm sorry, just $12,000,

15:46.040 --> 15:49.040
I thought I might have got
a ball of yarn with it as well.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.280
Nup?

15:50.320 --> 15:51.920
Sorry about that.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.120
Yeah, I know, I know.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.200
OK, bye.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.480
This one's not coming back,
you know.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.000
She's like the lady from before?
She's not coming back.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.360
She's like the lady from before?
She's not coming back.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.840
I've got no way of contacting her

16:01.880 --> 16:03.080
because you wouldn't
get her details.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.560
Now, I'm $12,000 in the hole...

16:04.600 --> 16:05.640
Oh, there she is.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.720
Hey.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.080
What happened?
Oh, they don't know yet.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.320
He's still in there.
OK, where are you going?

16:12.360 --> 16:14.240
Oh, apparently
there's a decent coffee shop

16:14.280 --> 16:16.360
next door
and they said we should wait there.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.520
Oh, we wait there?
Yeah.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.040
OK.
But our vet's with him.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.200
OK. Is it a different vet?

16:22.240 --> 16:23.640
No, Yvette.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.280
But is it the same lady as before?

16:25.320 --> 16:26.840
Is it our vet?

16:26.880 --> 16:28.520
Yeah.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.160
Sorry, are you having a stroke?

16:30.200 --> 16:31.200
What are you saying?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.680
Yvette is operating on him...

16:32.720 --> 16:34.440
Yvette? The vet's name's Yvette?

16:34.480 --> 16:36.480
Yes!
The vet's name's Yvette.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.400
Yeah, it is.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.560
Doctor Yvette.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.960
Don't talk to her. Come on.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.160
Oh, god!

16:46.640 --> 16:50.080
I'm Yvette, and I'm a vet.
Got it. I've got it.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.680
So, you don't actually know
which one I'm saying there.

16:51.720 --> 16:52.880
I know.
I'm a vet and I'm Yvette.

16:52.920 --> 16:53.960
I understand.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.400
I think, you're getting
a bit hung up on it.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.320
A bit? It's mental.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.520
I mean, you have a point.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.760
I think, if your name was Jeeves,

16:59.800 --> 17:00.000
you probably wouldn't
become a butler, would you?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.400
you probably wouldn't
become a butler, would you?

17:01.440 --> 17:02.840
Why?

17:02.880 --> 17:04.480
Because all...what?

17:04.520 --> 17:06.720
Because all butlers
are called Jeeves in the movies.

17:07.880 --> 17:08.960
How old are you?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.560
Are you two waiting on the dog?

17:10.599 --> 17:11.680
Yes.
Yeah.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.680
Yeah, I'm so sorry, guys.
They've called for you.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.839
He didn't make it.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.599
Oh, my god!
Oh.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.280
You might want to go next door.

17:20.360 --> 17:21.839
We killed a dog.
We didn't kill him.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.319
It was...it was an accident.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.839
Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.480
12 years, though. Decent innings.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.120
Thank you. What?

17:29.160 --> 17:30.440
You said 12 years?

17:30.480 --> 17:32.520
No, ours was like four.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.480
Wait, 12 years?

17:35.520 --> 17:37.400
That's us.

17:37.440 --> 17:41.280
Hang on. Ah, Lisa?
Ah, which dog is it?

17:42.840 --> 17:43.880
OK.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.120
Sorry, your dog is fine.
You can go next door.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.840
Yeah, you two.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.280
Chocolate labs and their livers.
I'm sorry.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.680
Chocolate?

17:54.720 --> 17:55.840
Ringo's dead?

17:57.640 --> 18:00.000
I just put him in for his shots.
I don't understand.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.600
I just put him in for his shots.
I don't understand.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.200
Is he alright?
Yeah.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.560
He looks pretty good.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.280
Wanna say sorry for hitting him?

18:09.320 --> 18:11.640
Sorry for hitting you, mate,
but I didn't do it alone.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.800
So, ah, let me give you guys
a lift to your place.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.200
That'd be nice.
Thank you so much.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.280
No worries.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.320
And it's not because I need to know
where you live or anything.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.600
You know,
I know you're paying me back.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.040
Yeah, I wasn't thinking it was...

18:25.080 --> 18:26.880
Yeah.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.960
So, what's your address?

18:29.080 --> 18:30.160
I'll just show you.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.000
Here we are.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.880
Yeah, this is me.

18:35.920 --> 18:36.960
OK.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.440
Great.
Alright, well, I'll be in touch.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.080
Great.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.520
I've got your number.
Alright.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.800
Do you want a hand with him, or...

18:45.840 --> 18:47.800
No, no, all good. Yeah.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.000
I'll let you know how he goes.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.840
Yeah, great. What a day.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.160
Yeah, so weird. OK.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.920
Ooh. Thank you.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.200
Thanks.
See ya.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.280
Bye.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.840
Great to see you again, mate.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.080
Ashley.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.120
Peter! How are you?

19:09.160 --> 19:12.680
It's Patrick, and I hope
that's not what it looks like.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.800
What's it look like?

19:13.840 --> 19:15.720
Ah, it looks like
you're trying to bring an animal

19:15.760 --> 19:17.120
into the house.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.200
Yeah, to be fair,

19:18.240 --> 19:19.880
I wasn't expecting to see
you here today.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.200
Today was your inspection.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.240
Was it?

19:22.280 --> 19:24.960
I have sent you so many texts, Ash.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.720
Sorry, can I just pop him inside?

19:26.760 --> 19:27.960
He's pretty heavy...

19:28.000 --> 19:29.600
In the public walkway.
Feel free.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.800
Alright, so he was actually
hit by a car today

19:33.840 --> 19:34.920
and I rescued him.

19:34.960 --> 19:35.960
I really don't care.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.200
This house
has a strict no pets policy.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.560
This house has black mould!

19:39.600 --> 19:41.320
We painted over that.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.840
Sorry, Ash, you're going
to have to lose the dog or move out.

19:43.880 --> 19:44.960
OK.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.880
Um, can I just have a couple of days
to figure something out?

19:49.920 --> 19:51.920
It's against policy.
Policy, yep.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.640
You signed the lease.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.360
Can you shut the fuck up, Tyler!

19:55.400 --> 19:56.480
I'm talking to Peter!

19:56.520 --> 19:59.520
(WHISPERS) Patrick.
Patrick. Fuck it!

19:59.560 --> 20:00.000
OK, wow. Right.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.280
OK, wow. Right.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.520
I'm coming in.
That's what's happening here.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.960
OK. Sorry.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.240
I'm coming in.
I'm coming in with the dog.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.520
I'm coming in. Move! Move. Now.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.480
Go on. It's my rights. It's 2022.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.600
You can't block a woman.

20:19.640 --> 20:20.720
Move!

20:22.880 --> 20:24.080
Sorry.
That's OK.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.440
Are you sliding?

20:29.480 --> 20:31.520
Yeah, I...I think
this is on backwards, mate.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.720
No, no, no, because see the red?

20:32.760 --> 20:33.840
The red goes underneath.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.040
Didn't the vet say...
That's right.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.160
..red goes on top?
Underneath.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.360
We're good. I think, we're good.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.440
OK, cool.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.520
I think, that's...
Is he alright?

20:39.560 --> 20:41.120
I think, that's it.
Is the brake on? Is there a brake?

20:41.160 --> 20:42.200
I don't think there is a brake.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.560
Hello. Hello, doggo.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.640
Does it work?
Come! Come here!
Come!

20:46.680 --> 20:47.920
Come.
Oh, my goodness!

20:47.960 --> 20:49.480
Yes!
Oh, my goodness it works!

20:49.520 --> 20:50.640
Alright! OK!

20:50.680 --> 20:52.920
What a good boy!
Nice job.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.560
Oh, wow.
Oh, hi!

20:54.600 --> 20:56.080
OK.
He's a good boy, isn't he?

20:56.120 --> 20:58.320
I have to go.
I'm beyond late.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.000
Oh, and um, I'm really sorry
about the mess.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Oh, and um, I'm really sorry
about the mess.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.480
Obviously I wasn't expecting anyone.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.360
No, it's fine.
And like, thanks for having me.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.120
Just for the afternoon,
while I sort something out.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.440
Cool.
It's a nice place.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.520
Yeah.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.200
Is that a unicycle?

21:12.240 --> 21:14.200
Yeah.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.800
Oh. And yours?

21:15.840 --> 21:16.880
Yeah.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.240
How long have you been single?

21:21.240 --> 21:24.200
A while.
So, ah, bathroom's through there.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.280
Make yourself at home.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.160
Mm-hm. Yeah.
OK, bye.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.880
I do have a nest camera
somewhere in the house.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.480
Always on.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.640
OK.
I'm joking. Am I?

21:34.680 --> 21:38.000
No I am. I trust you.
You're trust worthy.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.800
And you owe me $12,000,
so double the trust.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.200
OK, be good. Bye.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.560
Christ, can talk!

21:48.600 --> 21:51.120
Hey?
Ah, nothing. Bye!

21:51.160 --> 21:53.120
You said, sorry,
the bathroom's this way?

21:53.160 --> 21:55.320
Yep. Bye.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.520
Beeeee!

22:00.520 --> 22:02.320
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.120
Oh, my god!

22:10.160 --> 22:11.400
Oh, my god.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.640
Fuck it, really?

22:21.680 --> 22:22.800
What?

22:25.680 --> 22:26.800
Pretty good, actually.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.480
Fuck!

22:49.520 --> 22:51.160
(UPBEAT MUSIC)

22:52.960 --> 22:54.000
Fine.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.000
Fuck me.

23:00.000 --> 23:24.880
Fuck me.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.720
Sorry, everybody.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.360
That was disgusting.
You're disgusting.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.640
Hope you enjoy it.
Cheers.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.200
Who came in today?
Hey.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.320
What is...

23:59.360 --> 24:00.000
Oh, you just missed
Broadsheet Beckett.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.080
Oh, you just missed
Broadsheet Beckett.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.680
What? When?

24:02.720 --> 24:05.280
I wanted to show him
the new...what'd he have?

24:05.320 --> 24:06.400
A cider.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.440
He was supposed to try my IPA.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.640
Who bought him a fucking cider,
Brett?

24:11.680 --> 24:13.280
Well, he wanted a cider.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.960
Who reviews a brewery
and orders a cider, mate?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.200
Well, he seemed to like it,

24:17.240 --> 24:19.280
and he thought the complimentary
chickpeas were a nice tough.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.640
I gave him a hat. You're welcome.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.640
Yeah, OK. Yep, OK. OK.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.120
So, ah,
how's the dog and the flasher?

24:26.160 --> 24:29.520
Ah, dog lived.
But girl's at my house.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.920
What? What about her place?
Well...

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
You haven't found yourself
another homeless chick, have ya?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.320
No, that girl was not homeless.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.600
Yeah, she was.
No, she wasn't.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.480
She had a car. That's not the point.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.600
Point is, she can't take
the dog to her house

24:40.640 --> 24:43.040
'cause she can't have dogs
at her house, so...

24:43.080 --> 24:45.680
OK.
Listen to me, dumb-dumb.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.400
Most women don't just show you
their tit on the street.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.240
Seriously? It's weird.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.720
I don't mean to slut-shame her
or whatever.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.120
I mean, good on her
for taking control of her sexuality.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.200
But now she's in your home.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.520
I'm all sweaty
and nervous for you, Gordy.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.000
You need to be firm with this girl.
You do not need a dog.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.600
You need to be firm with this girl.
You do not need a dog.

25:02.640 --> 25:06.000
Get them out.
Yep. OK.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.000
Fuck, yes, you're right.
You're always right.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.440
What was I thinking?
I don't know.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.960
OK.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.920
I need to take control of this now.
Right now.

25:12.960 --> 25:16.080
I've missed Beckett now,
so I've just gotta do this.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.160
I'll see you in the morning,
first thing for the sour, yeah?

25:18.200 --> 25:19.240
7am, baby.
OK.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.600
Hey, text me
if you see the other one.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.520
OK. What? No! Bye.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.720
Hey, how's it going?

25:33.760 --> 25:34.800
Hey, good.

25:34.840 --> 25:37.400
Yep, the pain meds
are working a treat.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.480
Great.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.600
And the dog's doing good, too.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.280
Hey? Oh, good.
Gag. Icebreaker.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.600
Just a little joke.
Yeah.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.240
Um, so.

25:46.280 --> 25:51.680
I um...I've gotta go back to mine
and talk to my house mate,

25:51.720 --> 25:53.080
but I can't take the dog.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.880
Hey? No, no, no, what?
Yes.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.240
He's looking
for every excuse to kick me out.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.520
No. No.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.000
It can't happen, sorry.
No. Yes.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.400
It can't happen, sorry.
No. Yes.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.520
Listen, he's done a wee,
he's had his medication.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.920
I've written down what to do.
He's in his dress, bag thing.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.720
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
We didn't agree to this.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.040
I mean, has he done a poo?

26:10.080 --> 26:13.520
Because I'm not helping him
manually express out a poo.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.560
You have to help me out.
Do I?

26:15.600 --> 26:16.800
Yes!
Do I?

26:16.840 --> 26:19.400
Because...because honestly
I was driving along today,

26:19.440 --> 26:20.720
I was minding my own business...

26:20.760 --> 26:21.880
Yeah...
..I was on my way to work.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.520
..we've done this.
Have we?

26:23.560 --> 26:25.960
Are you honestly not

26:26.000 --> 26:28.280
Gonna offer to pay for half of that?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.040
'Cause I'm a student.
Did you know that?

26:30.080 --> 26:33.520
I eat fucken cold cuts for dinner.
And breakfast.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.240
I was happy, quite happy,
to put him down.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.040
Were you?
Were...were you really?

26:44.160 --> 26:45.920
Yeah, alright. I'll pay half.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.440
Will you?
Yeah. Yeah.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.840
Pay me...just pay me back half.
You're right.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.320
And can I leave him here tonight,
and I'll get him in the morning.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.520
First thing?

26:54.560 --> 26:55.680
First thing.
OK.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.480
Just leave a key
in a pot plant or something.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.600
Has he...

26:58.640 --> 26:59.720
OK.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.200
Is there really nobody else
you can call who can take him?

27:03.240 --> 27:04.280
No, mate.
Nobody?

27:04.320 --> 27:05.360
Nup.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.280
I've got a best friend,
but she takes care of her Nan.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.720
I've got other friends
that are hugely

27:08.760 --> 27:10.320
irresponsible and a Mum who sucks.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.560
You have a boyfriend, or...

27:11.600 --> 27:12.760
Nuh, not anymore.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.280
We just broke up and I'm a bit...

27:15.840 --> 27:17.560
messed up about it, so...

27:17.600 --> 27:19.440
I'm not gonna just like
booty call anyone.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.520
Also, I'm doing 30 days of sexless
with my best friend.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.840
What day are you on?

27:23.880 --> 27:24.960
Three.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.080
Jesus.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.040
Raising money for ovarian cancer.
Cool.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.480
Um, so, yeah
I do have a really early start...

27:30.520 --> 27:31.520
OK, that's fine.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.960
..because we're doing
a new batch in the morning.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
I'm a brewer.
Right.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.080
I run a brewery.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.160
Cool.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.760
You said you were a student.
What are you studying?

27:39.800 --> 27:42.440
Medicine. Sixth year prac.

27:42.480 --> 27:43.960
Really? Wow. That's impressive.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.600
So, my Uber's
a couple of minutes away.

27:45.640 --> 27:46.880
Do you want a shot of tequila?

27:46.920 --> 27:49.400
Um, no, I don't think
I have...oh, you have some.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.280
Yep.
OK. Yeah, fuck it. Why not?

27:51.320 --> 27:52.360
Go on.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.440
OK.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.640
I can't tell if it's a pro or a cony

27:56.680 --> 27:58.680
that you just happened
to have this in your bag.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.000
Yeah, you've got a drum kit
in your bedroom,

28:00.000 --> 28:00.240
Yeah, you've got a drum kit
in your bedroom,

28:00.280 --> 28:01.760
so let's not play that game.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.280
OK.
Yeah.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.800
Nice place. Do you own this?

28:05.840 --> 28:09.200
Oh, god no.
And the rent is slowly killing me.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.400
Cheers.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.240
To um...what's his name?

28:12.280 --> 28:14.160
Who?
Fluffy man.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.360
Oh, I don't know.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.560
Oh, we should give him a name.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.520
We should.
Yeah, but not a doggy name.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.680
No.
Not like Coco. Shit house.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.880
Princess.
Terrible.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.840
He needs a strong name,
like a human name.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.040
Yes.
Like...

28:26.240 --> 28:28.600
Oh...
Ian.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.720
Not quite.

28:29.760 --> 28:30.800
Walter.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.640
Close. Who is he?

28:34.520 --> 28:35.560
He's Colin.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.680
Colin.
He's Colin.

28:36.720 --> 28:37.920
He is. Colin from Accounts.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.720
Yes, Colin from Accounts Payable.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.760
Colin from Accounts Payable,
who's Working on the Big Merger.

28:42.800 --> 28:43.920
Yes!
That's his full title.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.600
Yeah, when he's in trouble.
Yep. To Colin.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.760
To Colin.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.160
Oh, ah!

28:51.840 --> 28:53.240
Oh!

28:53.280 --> 28:55.680
I think, the water was off today.
I should have told you that.

28:55.720 --> 28:56.760
I don't know?

28:56.800 --> 28:57.800
Or was it not?
Ah...

28:57.840 --> 28:59.320
Maybe it's tomorrow.
I don't know.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.000
That was quite good.
Should we have another one?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.040
That was quite good.
Should we have another one?

29:01.080 --> 29:03.080
Fuck no.
Oh, OK.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.000
Um...bye, Colin.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.520
Don't crunch too many numbers.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.560
Good luck with the merger.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.640
OK.
See ya.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.600
Alright,
I'll see you in the morning.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.440
Ooh. OK.
OK.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.640
See ya.
Bye.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.600
Everything's OK.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.360
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

29:33.560 --> 29:35.760
Oh, shit. OK, boy. Hey, hey!

29:35.800 --> 29:37.560
Oh, good boy, good boy.

29:38.720 --> 29:40.960
Hang on. Wait there, boy.
Wait there.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.960
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.480
Don't go. Don't go. Please don't go.

29:44.520 --> 29:45.960
He's losing his mind.
Yeah...

29:46.000 --> 29:47.320
I'll make up a spare room for you.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.320
I don't understand dogs.
I grew up with cats.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.360
Oh.
Please?

29:50.400 --> 29:53.720
I don't...I don't know what to do.
I can't make him poo!

29:53.760 --> 29:55.920
Yeah,
it's just my Uber's nearly here.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.400
I'll pay the cancellation fee.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.840
It's more my rating...

29:58.880 --> 30:00.000
Please. Please!
He's...he's...listen to him.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.960
Please. Please!
He's...he's...listen to him.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Yeah, OK, I'm coming.

30:04.040 --> 30:07.080
I'm coming, Col, I'm coming.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.120
There's my Uber.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.480
Let it go, mate!

30:22.240 --> 30:23.320
Can you hold it?

30:32.520 --> 30:34.600
No, I'm not doing it, mate.
You do it yourself.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.800
Come on.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.880
Go or don't go.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.080
I'm not here to...

30:41.720 --> 30:42.920
You wanted to come out here.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.680
I'm not fucking...nuh.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.200
Oh! Oh, yes! You've done it.
You've done it.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.360
Oh, mate, that's impressive.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.120
Good boy! Good boy!

30:53.160 --> 30:55.440
You did it all by yourself.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.440
Thank god. OK.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.600
Alright.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.000
Oh, my god, that is massive!

31:00.000 --> 31:02.120
Oh, my god, that is massive!

31:02.160 --> 31:05.520
Oh! Oh, god. Oh, god.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.240
That is the biggest shit.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.200
You must have been bottling that in.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.320
Eugh!

31:11.440 --> 31:13.920
Oh, Ahh! Well done.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.200
OK, come on.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.240
Back in, for God's sake.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.400
Come on, little mate.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.200
Here we go. Yes, good boy.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.600
I'll help ya. Here we go. Oh, fuck.

31:25.640 --> 31:26.920
Here we go. Oh, my god.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.760
# Lookin' for like I lost a friend

31:28.800 --> 31:30.520
# Jump out of my bed like,
"Where the bread"

31:30.560 --> 31:32.520
# You gon' hold a egg,
Waiter bring the check

31:32.560 --> 31:35.400
# When we talk, we Kalashnikov,
Keep us in your thoughts

31:35.440 --> 31:37.160
# Fully dressed at the crack of dawn

31:37.200 --> 31:38.320
# Weapons letting off

31:38.360 --> 31:39.640
# I can hear them from the block

31:39.680 --> 31:41.040
# See them creeping through the fog

31:41.080 --> 31:43.160
# Season's greetings,
Now feeding season can start

31:43.200 --> 31:44.600
# Oh my god look alive

31:44.640 --> 31:46.760
# Lookin' like
I live life on the crooked line

31:46.800 --> 31:48.440
# I'm a dog I'm a dirty dog

31:48.480 --> 31:49.720
# Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. #
