WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.395
WHAT IF A DEMON ATTACKS
WHILE I'M OUT?

00:04.569 --> 00:05.875
Leo: THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO ATTACK, ALL RIGHT?

00:06.049 --> 00:07.181
THEY THINK YOU'RE DEAD.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.399
NO, I DON'T MEAN HERE,
I MEAN ANYWHERE,

00:08.573 --> 00:10.097
IN GENERAL.

00:10.271 --> 00:11.881
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LIKE
ANYWHERE AROUND THE CITY?

00:12.055 --> 00:14.188
YEAH. WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO,

00:14.362 --> 00:15.841
JUST IGNORE IT?

00:16.016 --> 00:17.191
I SHOULD'VE GONE TALLER.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.019
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE TALLER.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.368
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

00:20.542 --> 00:22.413
YES. JUST IGNORE IT.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.285
WHY'D YOU GO BLONDE?

00:24.459 --> 00:26.374
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF
TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.941
BESIDES,
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.727
LEO, THE JINGLING
IS BACK.

00:31.901 --> 00:32.858
CAN YOU HELP ME
GET RID OF IT?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.730
JUST IGNORE IT.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.688
THAT'S HIS ADVICE
FOR THE DAY.
EXCUSE ME.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.386
I CAN'T IGNORE IT.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.735
IT'S RELENTLESS.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.606
WHAT DOES THAT LITTLE
WITCH WANT ANYWAY?

00:41.780 --> 00:43.391
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW SHE'S CALLING YOU.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.045
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
NEW CHARGES DON'T.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.481
SOMETIMES
IT'S JUST SUBLIMINAL.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.396
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
GET MY LIFE BACK, THEN?

00:48.570 --> 00:50.224
YOUR LIFE?
WHAT ABOUT MY LIFE?

00:50.398 --> 00:52.052
WHAT ABOUT IT?

00:52.226 --> 00:54.576
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
MARRY A GUY I JUST
MET IN AN ELEVATOR?

00:54.750 --> 00:57.405
EXCUSE ME, BUT I
WAS OBSESSING FIRST.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.015
NO, NO, NO. EXCUSE ME.
OUT OF MY WAY.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.408
NO, ACTUALLY I WAS.

01:00.582 --> 01:03.237
I THINK MARRYING
A COMPLETE STRANGER WINS.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.848
I MEAN, HE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHO I REALLY AM.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.980
OK, BUT HE'S A REALLY,
REALLY CUTE STRANGER.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.939
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT,
GUYS, DO YOU MIND?

01:10.113 --> 01:11.767
AT LEAST HE'S NOT
DRIVING YOU CRAZY.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.856
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
MEDITATING.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.945
I JUST GOT
MY LIFE BACK. I DON'T
WANT TO GET HITCHED YET.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.425
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH GETTING HITCHED.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.949
NOW, GUYS, REALLY, OK?
BACK TO MY LIFE.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.994
MAYBE I SHOULD GO
TO MAGIC SCHOOL
TO GET RID OF IT.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.431
I MEAN,
HE IS CUTE AND ALL.

01:23.605 --> 01:24.823
BUT THEN AGAIN,
YOU KNOW,

01:24.997 --> 01:26.521
I COULD
RISK EXPOSURE.

01:26.695 --> 01:27.739
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE DOES.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.219
[WHISTLES]

01:29.393 --> 01:31.482
FAMILY MEETING NOW.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.615
IF SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO GO TO MAGIC SCHOOL,

01:33.789 --> 01:34.616
ALL SHE HAD TO DO
WAS TELL ME.

01:34.790 --> 01:35.617
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

01:35.791 --> 01:36.879
WHAT TO DO?

01:45.322 --> 01:46.454
IT'S ABANDONED.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.238
NO ONE'S HERE.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.980
ALTHOUGH THEY COULD
STILL BE INVISIBLE.

01:51.154 --> 01:53.287
THIS IS MAGIC SCHOOL
AFTER ALL.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.289
NO.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.769
THE MAGIC HERE
IS ALL OURS NOW.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.728
ARE YOU SURE?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.167
HAH!

02:04.341 --> 02:05.560
HYAH!

02:05.734 --> 02:07.127
HAH!

02:12.610 --> 02:14.046
POSITIVE.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.017
OK, PEOPLE,
WE GOT TO GET A GRIP HERE.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.715
OTHERWISE, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

03:13.889 --> 03:16.021
WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO
BACK TO FIGHTING DEMONS AGAIN.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.154
EVEN IF THEY THINK
WE'RE DEAD?

03:18.328 --> 03:19.634
IT WAS
A RHETORICAL QUESTION.

03:19.808 --> 03:20.939
NO, IT WASN'T.

03:21.113 --> 03:21.940
PAIGE!

03:22.114 --> 03:23.638
WHAT?

03:23.812 --> 03:24.943
I THINK THE POINT IS
THAT WE NEED TO
TAKE IT SLOW,

03:25.117 --> 03:26.423
YOU KNOW, BE PATIENT.

03:26.597 --> 03:27.816
YEAH, WELL, TELL THAT
TO MY PREMONITION.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.296
AND MY STUPID CHARGE.

03:29.470 --> 03:30.297
[WHISTLES]

03:30.471 --> 03:31.298
OHH. UHH.

03:31.472 --> 03:32.516
DON'T EVEN START.

03:32.690 --> 03:33.778
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

03:33.952 --> 03:34.823
LATE FOR WHAT?

03:34.997 --> 03:36.564
MY SPA DAY.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.653
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING
A FACIAL AND A MASSAGE

03:38.827 --> 03:40.611
AND A SEAWEED
WRAPPY THING.

03:40.785 --> 03:41.699
I'M SO JEALOUS.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.179
WELL, IT WAS PHOEBE'S IDEA.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.137
WE WERE WATCHING
SEX AND THE CITYAND...

03:45.312 --> 03:47.052
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

03:47.227 --> 03:49.620
DID CARRIE EVER
HAVE TO MARRY A MAN THAT
SHE DID NOT KNOW? HUH?

03:49.794 --> 03:50.621
CARRIE?

03:50.795 --> 03:52.101
DON'T ASK.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.494
THEY'RE ON
SEX AND THE CITYAGAIN.

03:53.668 --> 03:54.669
YEAH. NO.
THE ANSWER IS NO.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.714
SHE DID NOT.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.977
WHY CAN'T WE LIVE OUR LIVES
LIKE THEY DID?

03:59.151 --> 04:01.850
UH, DIDN'T ONE OF THEM
SLEEP AROUND A LOT?

04:02.024 --> 04:03.243
NO. SHE WAS A FREE SPIRIT,

04:03.417 --> 04:04.505
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

04:04.679 --> 04:06.158
CAN ONLY HAPPEN
WHEN YOU'RE FREE.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.290
[WHISTLES]

04:07.464 --> 04:09.074
GOD, IS THAT
REALLY NECESSARY?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.859
APPARENTLY. LOOK. OK.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.035
NOBODY SAID
THIS WAS GONNA BE EASY.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.689
WE NEED TO GET
A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE HERE.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.430
HOW BAD CAN THINGS BE

04:16.604 --> 04:19.911
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE DEMONS
TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE?

04:20.085 --> 04:21.478
THANK YOU. LOOK.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.872
YOU, YOU NEED TO FOCUS
ON SOMETHING ELSE.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.222
YOU GOT TO GET THAT CHARGE
OFF YOUR MIND.

04:26.396 --> 04:29.094
WELL, PEOPLE, I AM
OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.487
DO WHAT GRAM SAID.

04:30.661 --> 04:31.706
GET OUT THERE.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.621
IGNORE THE SIGNS
OF YOUR OLD LIFE

04:33.795 --> 04:36.145
AND LOOK FOR SIGNS
THAT LEAD YOU
TO YOUR NEW LIFE.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.407
TRY ANYTHING.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.714
AND YOU,
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT SIGNS.

04:39.888 --> 04:42.586
SO, ISN'T THAT EXACTLY
WHAT A VISION IS ANYWAY?

04:42.760 --> 04:43.587
YEAH, BUT--

04:43.761 --> 04:44.762
DON'T MAKE ME WHISTLE.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.895
LAST YEAR
YOU HAD A PREMONITION

04:47.069 --> 04:48.723
THAT YOU WERE
GONNA HAVE A DAUGHTER,

04:48.897 --> 04:50.507
WHICH MEANS THEN THIS YEAR

04:50.681 --> 04:52.553
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE SEX AND GET PREGNANT.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.815
AND SINCE DEX,

04:53.989 --> 04:55.817
WHICH COINCIDENTALLY
RHYMES WITH SEX,

04:55.991 --> 04:57.079
COULD BE THE FATHER...

04:57.253 --> 04:58.472
GOD.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.300
LOOK. I SUGGEST
YOU GET TO KNOW HIM...

05:00.474 --> 05:02.345
WELL AND FAST.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.217
BECAUSE THIS MAY BE
THE ONE SIGN YOU CAN'T IGNORE.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.351
ALL RIGHT?
EVERYBODY GOOD?

05:08.525 --> 05:11.267
PEOPLE? GREAT.
SEE YOU LATER.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.274
[THINKING]
MAYBE PIPER'S RIGHT.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.929
I MEAN, IF THERE'S
ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED,

05:21.103 --> 05:22.539
IT'S THAT
WE'RE BEING GUIDED...

05:22.713 --> 05:25.586
AND SIGNS ALWAYS LEAD THE WAY.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.022
THE QUESTION IS,

05:27.196 --> 05:28.589
WHERE DO YOU START
LOOKING FOR THEM?

05:28.763 --> 05:29.720
START WITH DEX.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.766
SEE IF YOU
EVEN LIKE HIM.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.470
ISN'T THE FACT THAT WE COULD
TAKE THIS PLACE OVER

05:40.644 --> 05:42.907
PROOF ENOUGH THAT
THE CHARMED ONES
ARE REALLY DEAD?

05:43.081 --> 05:44.561
UNLESS THEY'RE IN HIDING.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.259
THEY WOULD NOT LEAVE
MAGIC SCHOOL UNPROTECTED,

05:47.434 --> 05:48.783
OR LEAVE ITS POWERS
FOR US TO TAKE.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.219
PERHAPS NOT,

05:50.393 --> 05:51.612
BUT THEN AGAIN,

05:51.786 --> 05:54.354
THAT'S THE MYSTERY
WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.268
ISN'T IT?

05:56.443 --> 05:57.879
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

05:58.053 --> 06:00.708
ANY PROGRESS
ON THAT FRONT?

06:00.882 --> 06:04.102
WE'VE LURED
3 TEENAGERS SO FAR,

06:04.276 --> 06:06.235
TURNED THEM ALL,

06:06.409 --> 06:08.672
AND YET NO SIGN
OF THE WITCHES.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.283
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO
IGNORE THE CRIES FOR LONG.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.285
IF THE SISTERS ARE ALIVE,

06:13.460 --> 06:15.462
THEY WILL COME TO THE RESCUE.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.115
IT'S IN THEIR BLOOD.

06:17.289 --> 06:19.640
UNLESS YOUR PLAN
IS TOO OBSCURE
FOR THEM TO NOTICE.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.946
MAYBE YOU GIVE THEM
TOO MUCH CREDIT.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.472
DEMONS HAVE USED
MORTAL FAIRY TALES

06:25.646 --> 06:27.474
TO TRAP THEM BEFORE.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.258
IT'S IN THE TEXTBOOKS--

06:29.432 --> 06:35.003
HOW CINDERELLA NEARLY TURNED
THE CHARMED ONES INTO PUMPKINS.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.657
HUMANS ARE RAISED
ON THESE INSIDIOUS TALES.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.310
THEY TAP
INTO UNIVERSAL THEMES,

06:38.485 --> 06:39.877
COMMON EMOTIONS,

06:40.051 --> 06:41.662
FEARS.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.839
THAT'S WHY WE CAN LURE
THE VICTIMS SO EASILY.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.798
DON'T WORRY.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.148
SOONER OR LATER,
THE CHARMED ONES WILL FOLLOW,

06:50.322 --> 06:51.498
AND WHEN THEY DO,

06:51.672 --> 06:53.282
WE WILL HAVE THEM.

06:53.456 --> 06:56.764
BUT WHAT IF THEY
DON'T TAKE THE BAIT?

06:56.938 --> 06:58.679
WHAT IF
THEY LIVE NO MORE?

06:58.853 --> 07:01.290
WELL, THEN WE MESS UP
A FEW KIDS.

07:01.464 --> 07:04.206
AND THAT'S FUN
ALL BY ITSELF, ISN'T IT?

07:06.513 --> 07:11.343
TIME TO FIND
OUR NEXT ALICE.

07:13.345 --> 07:16.044
Phoebe: SIGNS, OF COURSE,
CAN BE GOOD OR BAD.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.872
BUT THEY SHOULD
NEVER BE IGNORED.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.657
I'M TELLING YOU,
SOMETHING REALLY
WEIRD'S GOING ON.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.703
I MEAN, COME ON,
WHY AREN'T THE COPS

07:22.877 --> 07:24.052
DOING SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS?

07:24.226 --> 07:25.009
IT'S
TOTALLY WHACKED.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.620
I DON'T KNOW.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.230
THEY PROBABLY THINK
IT'S JUST DRUGS OR SOMETHING.

07:28.404 --> 07:29.449
IT'S NOT DRUGS.
NO WAY.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.189
THIS IS SOMETHING
WAY MORE SCARY,

07:31.363 --> 07:33.148
BUT THEY JUST DON'T CARE.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.541
NOBODY CARES.
WE'RE TEENAGERS.

07:34.715 --> 07:37.108
NO, THAT GIRL ALLYSON
JUST TURNED 20.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.197
WHO'S ALLYSON?

07:39.371 --> 07:40.503
ALLYSON.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.418
THE SORORITY CHICK
THAT WENT MISSING,

07:42.592 --> 07:44.420
THEN WAS LATER FOUND
WALKING AROUND

07:44.594 --> 07:45.943
LIKE HER HARD DRIVE
HAD JUST BEEN ERASED.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.379
HER HARD DRIVE?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.164
THIS ISN'T FUNNY,
BILLIE.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.687
THIS IS SERIOUS.

07:50.861 --> 07:51.906
SOME CREEP'S OUT THERE
PREYING ON KIDS LIKE US,

07:52.080 --> 07:54.865
AND NOBODY'S
DOING JACK ABOUT IT.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.476
DON'T YOU EVEN CARE?

07:56.650 --> 07:58.826
ACTUALLY, WHAT I
CARE ABOUT RIGHT NOW

07:59.000 --> 08:00.480
IS NOT BEING LATE
FOR METAPHYSICS,

08:00.654 --> 08:02.220
WHICH I'M FAILING.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.570
UNBELIEVABLE.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.616
WHATEVER.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.837
ALL I GOT TO SAY IS THAT
SOMEBODY BETTER DO SOMETHING

08:10.011 --> 08:12.187
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE
GETS HURT.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.778
Phoebe: SIGNS DON'T ALWAYS
MEAN WHAT WE THINK THEY DO.

08:37.952 --> 08:40.041
THEY CAN, AFTER ALL,
BE CONFUSING,

08:40.215 --> 08:41.651
ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S WORLD

08:41.825 --> 08:44.001
WHERE WE'RE CONSTANTLY
BOMBARDED BY THEM.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.742
STILL IT'S UP TO US
TO INTERPRET THEM

08:45.916 --> 08:47.265
THE BEST WAY
WE KNOW HOW.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.006
IT'S CALLED SURVIVAL.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.666
YOU GOIN' UP?

08:57.798 --> 08:59.626
YEAH. BUT...
NOT RIGHT NOW.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.844
IT'S OK. GO AHEAD.

09:03.499 --> 09:04.805
Phoebe:
UNFORTUNATELY, WAITING

09:04.979 --> 09:06.981
FOR JUST THE RIGHT SIGN
TO COME ALONG

09:07.155 --> 09:08.678
CAN BE FRUSTRATING,

09:08.852 --> 09:12.290
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE
IN A HURRY TO CONCEIVE...

09:12.464 --> 09:15.380
WHICH IS WHY SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE TO...

09:16.468 --> 09:17.818
Both: HI.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.472
HELP MAKE THE SIGNS
COME TO YOU.

09:20.647 --> 09:24.302
UH, IT'S, UH,
DEX. RIGHT?

09:24.476 --> 09:25.695
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.

09:25.869 --> 09:29.003
AND...YOU'RE...
JULIE?

09:29.177 --> 09:30.178
YOU REMEMBERED.

09:30.352 --> 09:31.875
HOW COULD I FORGET?

09:32.049 --> 09:34.661
ON THE OTHER HAND,
SOME SIGNS COME TO YOU

09:34.835 --> 09:36.793
EVEN WHEN
YOU WISH THEY WOULDN'T.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.844
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL
DAYS, HOWEVER,

19:54.018 --> 19:57.021
YOU WILL BE SCREENED
FOR POTENTIALLY
DISQUALIFYING BEHAVIOR.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.024
YOU WILL BE ASKED
TO CRITICALLY ANALYZE
A SITUATION

20:00.199 --> 20:02.723
AND DETERMINE
AN APPROPRIATE
COURSE OF ACTION.

20:02.897 --> 20:05.029
YOU WILL BE EXPECTED
TO ACT ASSERTIVELY

20:05.204 --> 20:08.381
AND WITHOUT HESITATION,
BUT WITHOUT OVERREACTING.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.818
AND YOU WILL BE TESTED
TO SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE

20:10.992 --> 20:13.429
QUICK, RESPONSIBLE
DECISIONS UNDER PRESSURE.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.214
AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR?

20:15.388 --> 20:16.911
PERFECTLY.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.217
WHAT'S
YOUR NAME, CADET?

20:18.391 --> 20:20.436
JO. BENNET.

20:20.610 --> 20:23.744
I'M GONNA KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU, BENNET.

20:23.918 --> 20:27.356
MAKING POOR CHOICES
AND FAILURE TO EXHIBIT
SOUND JUDGMENT

20:27.530 --> 20:30.185
IN A CRISIS SITUATION
ARE ALL NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES

20:30.359 --> 20:34.058
THAT CAN AND WILL DISQUALIFY
YOU FROM THIS ACADEMY.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.191
Phoebe: SOMETIMES
SIGNS ARE SO OBVIOUS

20:36.365 --> 20:39.977
ONLY A FOOL
COULD MISS THEM,
AND PAIGE IS NO FOOL.

20:40.151 --> 20:43.329
UNH! OOH!

20:43.503 --> 20:45.548
OH. HI.

20:45.722 --> 20:46.767
YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:46.941 --> 20:49.422
NO. YEAH.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.554
HORRIBLE MIGRAINE.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.600
I'M SORRY. I'M
GONNA HAVE TO GO.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.517
IT'S NOT EASY
STARTING NEW LIVES,

20:57.691 --> 20:59.388
FOLLOWING NEW SIGNS,

20:59.562 --> 21:01.869
ESPECIALLY
WHEN THE OLD ONES
KEEP GETTING IN THE WAY.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.436
UNH!

21:03.610 --> 21:05.394
AW, NO FAIR.
YOU MOVED!

21:18.929 --> 21:20.801
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO, KILL ME?

21:24.413 --> 21:26.067
YOU AGAIN?

21:28.678 --> 21:30.506
LOOK WHAT YOU DID!
I HAD HER.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.248
THEN WHY DID YOU
CALL FOR ME...AGAIN?

21:33.422 --> 21:35.250
UM, I DIDN'T
CALL YOU. I DON'T
EVEN KNOW YOU.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.861
THEN MAYBE
YOUR INNER WITCH DOES

21:38.035 --> 21:40.734
BECAUSE...SADLY...
I'M YOUR WHITELIGHTER.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.171
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.739
HEY, LET GO OF ME!

21:45.913 --> 21:47.349
I CAN'T. NOT
UNTIL I HELP YOU.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.003
I DON'T NEED
ANYBODY'S HELP.

21:50.439 --> 21:53.399
WELL, YOU NEED MY HELP
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.401
ARE YOU A COP?

21:55.575 --> 21:56.880
NO.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.317
GOOD. HYAH!

22:03.974 --> 22:05.280
HYAH!

22:07.326 --> 22:09.284
UNH!

22:10.720 --> 22:13.070
YOU'RE A BLONDE?

22:17.379 --> 22:19.555
SEE YA.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.778
HELP.

22:24.952 --> 22:27.998
SOMEBODY JUST TRIED
TO KIDNAP ME.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.876
Phoebe:
THERE YOU ARE!

22:36.050 --> 22:37.356
I GOT YOU
YOUR COFFEE DRINK.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.706
VANILLA NON-FAT LATTE,
NO WHIPPED CREAM, RIGHT?

22:39.880 --> 22:41.447
AM I THAT PREDICTABLE?

22:41.621 --> 22:44.101
WELL, EVERYBODY IS
WHEN IT COMES TO
THEIR COFFEE DRINK.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.103
HEH! OHH.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.932
OH, I TAKE IT
IT WENT WELL WITH DEX.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.239
OH, YES, IT DID.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.763
I MEAN, I'M NOT READY
TO MARRY THE GUY
OBVIOUSLY YET,

22:53.937 --> 22:56.070
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I COULD DO WORSE.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.942
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
I'VE DONE WORSE BEFORE.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.118
YEAH, WELL, YOU MAYBE
WANT TO TAKE IT

23:01.292 --> 23:03.251
A LITTLE BIT SLOW
DESPITE YOUR
PREMONITION.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.819
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
PIPER IS? I GOT HER
A CARAMEL MACCHIATO.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.212
NO, I DON'T.
I JUST GOT HOME.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.127
PAIGE, ARE YOU SCRYING?

23:10.301 --> 23:12.521
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE SCRYING.

23:12.695 --> 23:13.696
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO YELL
AT MY CHARGE, OK?

23:13.870 --> 23:15.350
BECAUSE SHE WON'T
LEAVE ME ALONE.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.308
SO YOU SCALPED HER?

23:17.483 --> 23:19.049
NO, I DID NOT.
I WAS OUT AND ABOUT

23:19.223 --> 23:23.097
WHEN SHE CALLED,
AND I FOUND HER
FIGHTING A DEMON.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.664
ANOTHER ONE?

23:24.838 --> 23:26.143
MM-HMM.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.102
HOW'D SHE DO?

23:28.276 --> 23:30.278
NOT AS GOOD AS
SHE THOUGHT SHE DID.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.106
BUT AT LEAST
SHE SAVED AN INNOCENT.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.021
AN INNOCENT?
WHAT INNOCENT?

23:34.195 --> 23:35.544
ONE OF
THOSE MISSING TEENS.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.198
AT LEAST SHE GOT TO HER
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.505
I THINK IF I CAN
FIND THAT LITTLE WITCH,

23:39.679 --> 23:42.159
I CAN FINALLY BE DONE
WITH ALL OF THIS STUFF.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.684
BY VANQUISHING
THE DEMON?

23:44.858 --> 23:47.382
IT'S THE GENERAL IDEA.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.340
I DON'T WANT TO BE
DOING THIS, YOU KNOW.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.473
PAIGE, IT'S COMPLETELY
UNDERSTANDABLE

23:51.647 --> 23:52.692
THAT YOU MISS YOUR OLD
LIFE SO MUCH THAT--

23:52.866 --> 23:55.216
I DON'T.

23:55.390 --> 23:58.001
MAYBE A TINY,
TINY LITTLE BIT,

23:58.175 --> 23:59.699
BUT NOT ENOUGH
TO MAKE ME GO BACK.

23:59.873 --> 24:03.833
DEFINITELY NOT.
THIS IS JUST
SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.575
OK. THEN
I'LL HELP YOU.

24:06.749 --> 24:09.970
NO, NO, NO. I THINK THE MORE
OF US THAT ARE INVOLVED,

24:10.144 --> 24:12.886
THE MORE WE RISK EXPOSURE.

24:13.060 --> 24:13.930
I'M GONNA BE OK.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.672
OK.

24:16.846 --> 24:19.153
OH, OH, OH! HEY,
THE PAPER CALLED
FOR YOU.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.242
REALLY?
WHAT DID THEY WANT?

24:21.416 --> 24:22.896
WELL, I THINK THEY
WANT TO TALK TO YOU,

24:23.070 --> 24:25.289
OR COUSIN YOU
OBVIOUSLY.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.596
I WONDER
WHAT THEY WANTED.

24:27.770 --> 24:29.032
WELL, I THINK
THEY JUST WANT
SOME QUOTES FROM YOU.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.860
YOU KNOW,
THE "ASK PHOEBE"
TRIBUTE AND ALL.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.906
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL
FIGURE ANYTHING OUT.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.995
I THINK YOU'LL BE OK.
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

24:35.169 --> 24:37.432
YOU'LL GET TO SEE DEX
AGAIN. [KISSING]

24:37.606 --> 24:39.347
HMM!

24:42.959 --> 24:46.093
Phoebe: SIGNS
CAN COME AT ANY TIME
AND FROM ANYWHERE,

24:46.267 --> 24:49.270
BUT WHEN YOU GET ONE,
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO FOLLOW IT,

24:49.444 --> 24:53.230
EVEN IF IT LEADS YOU
RIGHT INTO DANGER.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.754
HEH!

24:54.928 --> 24:56.930
HOW COULD YOU
LET HER GET AWAY?

24:57.104 --> 24:58.627
EVERY INNOCENT
COUNTS,

24:58.801 --> 25:00.542
ESPECIALLY WITH
WHO WE'RE ULTIMATELY
TRYING TO LURE.

25:00.716 --> 25:03.023
I DIDN'T LETHER
GET AWAY. A WITCH--

25:03.197 --> 25:05.460
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE
ONE LOUSY WITCH--

25:05.634 --> 25:07.593
IT WASN'T JUST ONE!

25:07.767 --> 25:09.072
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:09.246 --> 25:12.162
I MEAN SOMEBODY ELSE
CAME TO HELP.

25:12.336 --> 25:13.512
ANOTHER WITCH?

25:13.686 --> 25:16.776
NO. A WHITELIGHTER.
PROBABLY HERS.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.126
WASN'T ONE
OF THE CHARMED ONES
A WHITELIGHTER?

25:19.300 --> 25:22.521
HALF. WHY?

25:24.392 --> 25:26.612
BECAUSE MAYBE
IT WASN'T JUST
A WHITELIGHTER

25:26.786 --> 25:28.788
WHO CAME TO HELP.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.833
MAYBE IT WAS
REALLY HER SISTER.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.400
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

25:32.574 --> 25:33.967
NEITHER OF THEM
LOOKED ANYTHING LIKE--

25:34.141 --> 25:36.535
THEY WOULDN'T.

25:36.709 --> 25:39.015
THEY'D BE
IN DISGUISES.

25:39.189 --> 25:42.062
MAGICAL DISGUISES.

25:42.236 --> 25:45.021
PERHAPS WE'RE CLOSER
THAN WE THINK.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.154
WHAT IF WE ARE?

25:47.328 --> 25:49.809
HOW COULD WE KILL THEM
WHEN NO OTHER DEMON COULD?

25:49.983 --> 25:53.116
WE DON'T TRY.
WE CAN'T.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.640
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO
IS TAKE THEM

25:54.814 --> 25:57.120
ON THE SAME WILD
RIDE AS THE OTHERS

25:57.294 --> 26:00.646
WITH THE SAME
INEVITABLE RESULT.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.649
Piper: I GIVE UP!
IT'S NO USE. I QUIT.

26:03.823 --> 26:07.304
QUIT? QUIT WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

26:07.478 --> 26:10.351
EVERYTHING! I CAN'T
HAVE A NORMAL LIFE

26:10.525 --> 26:12.440
WHEN I CAN'T EVEN
HAVE A NORMAL DAY!

26:16.183 --> 26:18.185
NOT NOW, LEO!
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD!

26:18.359 --> 26:21.667
OH, COME ON.
LIKE THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

26:21.841 --> 26:25.540
COME ON, JUST TALK
TO ME, OK? WHAT IS IT?

26:25.714 --> 26:27.629
NOTHING.

26:29.979 --> 26:34.114
IT'S JUST--IT'S NOT
WHAT I EXPECTED,
THAT'S ALL.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.682
AND EVERY TIME I
TRY TO DO SOMETHING
FOR MYSELF,

26:36.856 --> 26:38.901
SOMETHING COMES
ALONG TO MESS IT UP.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.990
AND ASIDE FROM ALL
THE DEMON FIGHTING,

26:41.164 --> 26:44.080
IT'S NOT
THAT MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN IT USED TO BE.

26:44.254 --> 26:47.736
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I LOCKED MYSELF
OUT OF THE HOUSE. OK?

26:47.910 --> 26:50.913
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

26:51.087 --> 26:55.396
JUST--YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

26:55.570 --> 26:58.225
[SIGHS]
LOOK, THIS ALL
JUST HAPPENED, OK?

26:58.399 --> 27:01.054
YOU'RE
STARTING OVER. YOU
HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.230
OK, TRUST ME.
IT'S GONNA
TAKE SOME TIME.

27:03.404 --> 27:06.059
TIME?
HOW MUCH MORE TIME?

27:06.233 --> 27:07.277
I JUST LOST
ALL MY TWENTIES.

27:07.451 --> 27:08.452
HOW MUCH MORE TIME
DO YOU WANT?

27:08.627 --> 27:09.497
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:09.671 --> 27:12.239
[SIGHS]
I MEAN IT JUST...

27:12.413 --> 27:15.068
FEELS LIKE I JUST
WOKE UP AND I MISPLACED

27:15.242 --> 27:16.939
A HUGE CHUNK OF MY LIFE.

27:17.113 --> 27:20.377
I MEAN IT WENT BY
SO FAST. 7 YEARS AGO,

27:20.551 --> 27:22.423
I WAS FRESH OUT OF
COLLEGE, I WAS SINGLE,

27:22.597 --> 27:24.643
I WAS COOKING, I WAS
TRYING TO BECOME A CHEF,

27:24.817 --> 27:27.210
AND THEN--BOOM!
SUDDENLY, "HELLO! HI!

27:27.384 --> 27:29.517
YOU'RE A WITCH.
AND BY THE WAY,
SO IS YOUR WHOLE FAMILY,"

27:29.691 --> 27:31.954
AND WE'RE SAVING INNOCENTS,
THEN I'M SOMEBODY'S WIFE,

27:32.128 --> 27:33.608
AND THEN
I'M SOMEBODY'S MOTHER

27:33.782 --> 27:37.090
AND I'M SOMEBODY'S BOSS
AND I'M SOMEBODY'S SOMETHING.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.266
AND I JUST--

27:39.440 --> 27:41.268
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO START OVER.

27:41.442 --> 27:44.967
I'VE BEEN SO MANY THINGS
FOR SO LONG

27:45.141 --> 27:47.100
I DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM ANYMORE.

27:47.274 --> 27:50.712
WELL, I KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.628
YOU'RE
AN AMAZING MOM,

27:53.802 --> 27:57.110
AND YOU'RE
AN AMAZING WIFE,

27:57.284 --> 27:59.286
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
AN AMAZING PERSON.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.722
STOP.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.811
NO. YOU ARE.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.770
BUT YOU CAN'T
SACRIFICE YOURSELF

28:04.944 --> 28:07.424
FOR SO MANY PEOPLE
AND FOR SO MANY YEARS

28:07.598 --> 28:10.689
AND NOT EXPECT
A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.212
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

28:12.386 --> 28:14.605
AND WHAT I DO
ABOUT THE GUILT?

28:14.780 --> 28:16.042
WHAT GUILT?

28:16.216 --> 28:17.957
THE GUILT I FEEL WHEN
I KNOW VERY BAD THINGS

28:18.131 --> 28:21.351
ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE,
AND I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.962
LIKE THOSE MISSING KIDS.

28:23.136 --> 28:26.487
WELL,
BAD THINGS ARE ALWAYS
GONNA HAPPEN, PIPER.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.924
YOU KNOW THEY
HAPPENED LONG BEFORE
YOU BECAME A WITCH

28:29.098 --> 28:32.885
AND THEY'RE GONNA
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN
LONG AFTERWARDS.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.887
YOU'VE PAID YOUR DUES.

28:35.061 --> 28:37.585
YOU'VE BEEN SELFLESS.
NOW IT'S TIME
TO BE SELFISH.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.719
YOU DESERVE IT.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.459
WE ALL DO.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.956
WE'VE GOTTA STOP
MEETING LIKE THIS.

29:01.130 --> 29:04.003
YEAH? WHO SAYS?

29:04.177 --> 29:05.700
Phoebe: SOMETIMES
SIGNS ARE SUBTLE,

29:05.874 --> 29:08.921
EASILY MISSED, BUT IF YOU'RE
LUCKY ENOUGH TO CATCH THEM,

29:09.095 --> 29:13.012
THEY TEND TO SEND YOU
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.536
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF YOU MISS THEM,

29:15.710 --> 29:18.626
THEY CAN BITE YOU
IN THE ASS BIG TIME.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.106
DROP SOMETHING?

29:21.281 --> 29:23.022
[SIGHS]

29:29.376 --> 29:30.899
NICE COSTUME.
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

29:31.073 --> 29:32.292
SAKS. YOU LIKE IT.

29:32.466 --> 29:34.294
NO. WITCHES DON'T
ACTUALLY WEAR COSTUMES.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.165
OH, REALLY?
THE CONICAL HAT,
THE BROOMSTICK.

29:36.339 --> 29:37.210
THAT'S JUST
EVERYDAY WEAR?

29:37.384 --> 29:38.428
I MEANT RECENTLY.

29:38.602 --> 29:39.778
WELL, YOU SHOULD
BE MORE SPECIFIC.

29:39.952 --> 29:40.953
I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER
THAT FOR NEXT TIME.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.737
THANKS FOR THE TIP!

29:42.911 --> 29:44.260
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ANYWAY?

29:44.434 --> 29:46.349
WHAT'S YOURS?

29:46.523 --> 29:49.309
JO.

29:49.483 --> 29:50.440
BILLIE.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.529
WELL, BILLIE,

29:52.703 --> 29:55.271
SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE
A BIT OF A PROBLEM HERE.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.230
OH, YEAH?

29:57.404 --> 29:59.362
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
MY PROBLEM IS

29:59.536 --> 30:02.191
IS THAT YOU'RE
JUST KILLING MY BUZZ.

30:02.365 --> 30:04.933
HEH! BUZZ?

30:05.107 --> 30:06.413
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE CALLING
FIGHTING DEMONS?

30:06.587 --> 30:07.936
BEATS THE HELL
OUT OF VIDEO GAMES.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.199
THIS ISN'T
A GAME, OK?

30:10.373 --> 30:12.114
THIS IS REAL.
DEADLY REAL.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.203
YOU CAN'T USE
AN ADVERB WITH A NOUN.

30:14.377 --> 30:15.944
CHAIR!

30:17.903 --> 30:20.296
OH!

30:22.603 --> 30:23.734
OK, HERE'S
THE THING.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.432
PEOPLE ARE
GETTING KILLED,

30:25.606 --> 30:28.696
SO YOU ARE GONNA
TELL ME EVERYTHING
I WANT TO KNOW,

30:28.870 --> 30:30.045
AND YOU'RE GONNA
TELL IT TO ME NOW,

30:30.219 --> 30:31.438
OTHERWISE
WE'RE GONNA
GO AT IT AGAIN.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.266
FINE. I'M LISTENING.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.963
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN A WITCH?

30:35.137 --> 30:37.618
NOT THAT LONG. JUST UP
TILL REALLY RECENTLY,

30:37.792 --> 30:40.534
I NOTICED
I HAD THESE POWERS.

30:40.708 --> 30:43.015
SO I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF BOOKS
AND I FIGURED IT OUT.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.930
AND YOU FIGURED OUT
HOW TO TRACK DEMONS
THAT WAY?

30:45.104 --> 30:46.496
I'M GOOD.

30:46.670 --> 30:50.718
WELL, I AM.
LOOK, LET ME--MAY I?

30:53.112 --> 30:55.331
OK, WELL, FIRST,

30:55.505 --> 30:59.161
I NOTICED THAT ALL
THE MISSING KIDS HAD
ALICE-LIKE NAMES.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.903
YOU KNOW, LIKE
ALICIA, ALLISON,

31:02.077 --> 31:03.687
ALASTAIR, ALEX--

31:03.862 --> 31:05.341
THIS HAS TO DO
WITH WHAT?

31:05.515 --> 31:08.605
ALICE? YOU KNOW, LIKE
ALICE IN WONDERLAND.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.172
OK, WHEN THE VICTIMS
WERE FOUND,

31:10.346 --> 31:11.826
THEY WERE SAYING
ALL THESE WEIRD THINGS,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.176
LIKE MAD HATTERS,
WHITE RABBITS,

31:14.350 --> 31:16.657
STONE CATERPILLARS.
HAD TO BE SOMETHING
DEMONIC, RIGHT?

31:16.831 --> 31:18.485
IT WAS JUST
TOO COOL NOT TO BE.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.791
UM, NO. ACTUALLY DEMONIC
ISN'T SO COOL.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.054
IT'S KIND OF A BAD THING.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.143
OK, WHATEVER.
ANYWAYS, I INPUTTED IT

31:24.317 --> 31:27.059
ALL INTO THE COMPUTER,
I HOOKED THE CRYSTAL UP

31:27.233 --> 31:28.408
TO THE GPS SYSTEM,

31:28.582 --> 31:29.844
I STARTED SCRYING
FOR THE DEMON,

31:30.018 --> 31:32.760
AND VOILA! THERE HE WAS!
OR THERE SHE WAS.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.153
ARE MOST DEMONS CHICKS?

31:34.327 --> 31:36.633
UH, NO, NO, NOT ALWAYS.

31:36.807 --> 31:39.985
UH, YOU FIGURED THIS
ALL OUT BY YOURSELF?

31:40.159 --> 31:40.986
YEAH.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.117
OK, IN THAT CASE,

31:42.291 --> 31:43.249
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STAY PUT

31:43.423 --> 31:44.337
WHILE I GO
DEAL WITH THIS.

31:44.511 --> 31:45.729
WAIT? WHAT?!

31:45.904 --> 31:46.905
YOU ARE IN WAY OVER
YOUR HEAD, BILLIE.

31:47.079 --> 31:47.949
THAT'S WHY YOU CALLED
FOR MY HELP.

31:48.123 --> 31:50.517
I DID NOT
CALL FOR YOU!

31:50.691 --> 31:52.954
JUST LET ME AND MY SISTERS
DEAL WITH THIS, OK?

31:53.128 --> 31:55.652
WAIT? WHAT SISTERS?
ARE THEY WITCHES, TOO?

31:55.826 --> 31:59.004
JUST STAY HERE!

31:59.178 --> 32:00.875
I'LL BE BACK. UH!

32:01.049 --> 32:02.877
STAY!

32:17.022 --> 32:19.067
HEY, JULIE.

32:19.241 --> 32:22.418
DEX, HEY! WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:22.592 --> 32:23.985
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D STOP BY

32:24.159 --> 32:25.813
AND SEE
HOW THINGS WENT
WITH THE TRIBUTE.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.163
OH, ACTUALLY,
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE TRIBUTE.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.817
NO?

32:29.991 --> 32:31.993
WELL, APPARENTLY
THE NEWSPAPER'S
HAVING A HARD TIME

32:32.167 --> 32:35.301
GETTING
THE ADVICE COLUMN OUT
EVER SINCE--YOU KNOW.

32:35.475 --> 32:36.737
YEAH.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.869
SO THEY ASKED ME
TO HELP OUT A LITTLE BIT,

32:39.044 --> 32:40.219
WHICH I THOUGHT
WAS KIND OF WEIRD,

32:40.393 --> 32:41.872
BUT I SAID SURE
BECAUSE I'M HERE

32:42.047 --> 32:43.439
AND NOT DOING
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.702
WELL, YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE
ENJOYING YOURSELF.

32:45.876 --> 32:49.010
YEAH. OH, HEY, UM,

32:49.184 --> 32:50.620
GET THIS TO COPY
RIGHT AWAY,

32:50.794 --> 32:52.231
AND MAKE SURE THAT
"WORRIED IN WALNUT CREEK"

32:52.405 --> 32:53.710
IS BEFORE
"BUMMED IN BOSTON"

32:53.884 --> 32:56.496
BECAUSE IT JUST FLOWS
BETTER, OK? THANKS.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.717
HEH. DEADLINES.

33:00.891 --> 33:02.197
I WONDER WHAT MADE THEM
ASK YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE.

33:02.371 --> 33:04.069
I DON'T KNOW.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.941
THEY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT HOPING--

33:07.115 --> 33:09.596
IT MIGHT RUN
IN THE FAMILY?

33:09.770 --> 33:12.599
YES. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY SAID.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.733
WAIT A MINUTE.
DID YOU HAVE--

33:16.907 --> 33:18.692
I RAN INTO YOUR EDITOR
IN THE ELEVATOR.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.955
TOLD HER I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

33:21.129 --> 33:24.393
HEY, ANYTHING'S BETTER
THAN THE CRAP THEY'VE
BEEN PRINTING, RIGHT?

33:24.567 --> 33:28.789
YEAH. THANKS,
I THINK. HEH!

33:28.963 --> 33:31.313
LOOK, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT
YOUR COUSIN'S COLUMN.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.098
YOU KNOW,
I WAS HER BIGGEST FAN.

33:33.272 --> 33:37.276
I CAN SEE THAT.

33:37.450 --> 33:40.235
IT'S TOO BAD YOU
NEVER GOT TO KNOW HER.

33:40.409 --> 33:42.716
WELL, UM...

33:42.890 --> 33:45.066
MAYBE YOU COULD
CATCH ME UP OVER DINNER.

33:47.503 --> 33:49.375
Reporter: A FOURTH VICTIM,
ALICE ROBBINS, 18,

33:49.549 --> 33:52.160
HAS JUST BEEN DISCOVERED
WALKING DOWN THE MIDDLE
OF MARKET STREET

33:52.334 --> 33:55.381
WITHOUT ANY SENSE
OF WHO SHE WAS OR
WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.339
WITNESSES SAY THAT,
LIKE THE OTHERS,

33:57.513 --> 34:00.168
SHE WAS MUMBLING
INCOHERENTLY. IN THIS CASE,

34:00.342 --> 34:02.127
ABOUT A PATH
THAT LEADS NOWHERE
AND SMILES WITHOUT FACES.

34:02.301 --> 34:04.825

WITHOUT FACES.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.783
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON OUT THERE?

34:06.957 --> 34:09.090
UH, I HAVE
TO GO NOW.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.091
WHAT?

34:10.265 --> 34:11.832
I'LL CALL YOU.
I'M SORRY.

34:17.142 --> 34:19.492
THE TEENS ARE BEING
LURED BY A FAIRY TALE.

34:19.666 --> 34:22.147
YEAH. ALICE IN
WONDERLAND.WE KNOW.

34:23.322 --> 34:24.149

34:24.323 --> 34:25.846

34:26.020 --> 34:28.022
PAIGE'S NEW CHARGE.
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

34:28.196 --> 34:29.154
IS WHY
ALICE IN WONDERLAND.

34:29.328 --> 34:30.285
WHY DID THE DEMON
PICK THAT ONE?

34:30.459 --> 34:31.547
ARE YOU KIDDING?

34:31.721 --> 34:33.288
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE LOSS OF INNOCENCE,

34:33.462 --> 34:35.334
THE NEED FOR ESCAPE,

34:35.508 --> 34:37.553
THE SEARCH
FOR ONE'S IDENTITY.

34:37.727 --> 34:40.426
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I'M SURPRISED
IT DIDN'T LURE US, TOO.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.602
MAYBE IT WAS MEANT TO.
WHY ELSE WOULD A DEMON

34:42.776 --> 34:44.169
GO THROUGH
ALL THAT TROUBLE?

34:44.343 --> 34:45.605
WHAT, JUST TO MESS
WITH A COUPLE OF KIDS?

34:45.779 --> 34:46.954
POSSIBLY.

34:47.128 --> 34:48.477
I THINK THESE SIGNS
ARE TOO ELABORATE

34:48.651 --> 34:49.478
NOT TO BE
MEANT FOR US.

34:49.652 --> 34:50.958
AND BILLIE.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.394
WELL, NO, I DON'T THINK
IT WAS MEANT FOR HER.

34:52.568 --> 34:53.787
I THINK
SHE JUST FOUND IT.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.702
WHICH MAKES HER
ONE SMART WITCH.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.008
YEAH, MAYBE
TOO SMART FOR HER
OWN GOOD, I THINK.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.358
SO YOU THINK
THIS IS A TRAP?

34:59.532 --> 35:00.446
COULD BE.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.274
OK, THEN
WHAT DO WE DO?

35:02.448 --> 35:03.710
I MEAN WE CAN'T GO
AFTER THE DEMON.

35:03.884 --> 35:05.190
WELL, IF WE
DON'T DO ANYTHING,

35:05.364 --> 35:06.582
THEN MORE INNOCENTS
WILL BE HURT.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.280
INNOCENTS ARE ALWAYS
GONNA GET HURT.

35:08.454 --> 35:10.151
I KNOW, LEO, BUT IT'S
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

35:10.325 --> 35:11.631
WHEN WE'RE AWARE OF IT.

35:11.805 --> 35:16.026
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
SOMETHING WE CAN IGNORE.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.724
SO HOW DO WE
FIND THEM?

35:17.898 --> 35:19.769
WELL, BILLIE KNOWS
HOW. I'LL GO GET HER
SCRYING STUFF

35:19.943 --> 35:21.206
AND YOU STAY AND
MAKE POTIONS, OK?

35:21.380 --> 35:23.295
WHAT IF SHE
FIGURES US OUT?

35:23.469 --> 35:24.948
I DON'T THINK SHE'S
GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT

35:25.123 --> 35:27.647
BECAUSE TO HER
THIS IS ALL JUST
A LOVELY LITTLE GAME.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.171

WE'D BETTER WIN.

HOW SHE SCRYED.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.145

36:33.321 --> 36:37.064

39:20.401 --> 39:21.228
EVERYTHING.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.577
FORGET IT.

39:22.751 --> 39:25.450
WAIT A SECOND. WHAT DO
YOU HAVE TO OFFER?

39:25.624 --> 39:27.843
I CAN HELP YOU GUYS
FIGHT THE DEMONS

39:28.017 --> 39:29.758
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO IT ALL THE TIME.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.892
I MEAN, I ASSUME
THAT IS WHY YOU FAKED
YOUR OWN DEATHS, RIGHT?

39:33.066 --> 39:35.329
YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE IS TOO
SMART FOR HER OWN GOOD.

39:35.503 --> 39:39.028
ALL RIGHT.
ONE CONDITION.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.987
LOSE THE CHEAP
VINYL OUTFIT.

39:41.161 --> 39:43.685
OH.

39:43.859 --> 39:45.861
SORRY.

39:49.822 --> 39:52.651
Phoebe:
IT'S FUNNY SOMETIMES
WHERE SIGNS LEAD YOU--

39:55.088 --> 39:57.177
RARELY WHERE YOU THOUGHT
YOU'D GO,

39:57.351 --> 39:59.527
BUT ALWAYS
WHERE YOU BELONG.

40:02.661 --> 40:05.794
IN PAIGE'S CASE,
THOUGH SHE REALIZED
THAT BEING A COP

40:05.968 --> 40:07.666
WASN'T HER CUP OF TEA,

40:07.840 --> 40:10.625
BEING WITH
A CERTAIN COP WAS.

40:10.799 --> 40:13.933
FOR PIPER, THE ONLY SIGN
SHE REALLY NEEDED

40:14.107 --> 40:17.327
WAS THE ONE THAT REMINDED
HER SHE WASN'T ALONE.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.591
HEH HEH HEH!

40:19.765 --> 40:22.855
HEH HEH HEH!

40:23.029 --> 40:25.553
OH, YEAH. SORRY. HERE.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.512
OH, WELL.

40:27.686 --> 40:28.774
HA!

40:31.733 --> 40:35.345
AS FOR ME, I DISCOVERED
THAT, JUST LIKE ALICE,

40:35.520 --> 40:37.957
NO MATTER
HOW WILD THE RIDE,

40:38.131 --> 40:41.482
SIGNS WILL LEAD YOU
RIGHT BACK TO WHERE
YOU STARTED FROM...

40:41.656 --> 40:44.398
CHANGED, DIFFERENT...

40:44.572 --> 40:47.183
BUT...HOME.

41:03.504 --> 41:07.465
AND THEY ALL LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER...
