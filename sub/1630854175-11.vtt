Tomorrow,
we should grab a cup.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.715
It's a date.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.350
No, it's coffee.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.618
You guys, uh, came together?

00:17.618 --> 00:18.686
We were having coffee.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.121
Well, the tea's
still brewing.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.958

you know, hot.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.660

04:52.660 --> 04:54.728

Hey!

04:55.963 --> 04:57.531
Too soon,

04:57.531 --> 05:00.634
I agree. You had
emergency heart surgery.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.836
You should be off
at least another week.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.338
Simone, please.
We have work to do.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.574
<i>Tío,</i> remember,
ease yourself back in.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.209
You promised me you'd implement
a relaxed approach from now on.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.078
I know. I know.
But that was this morning.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.280
So as you've all probably
already heard,

05:13.280 --> 05:15.783
Congressman Damien Roberts was
almost killed in a car bombing.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.185
I just received a call from HQ
saying that the congressman

05:18.185 --> 05:21.188
is gonna need a protection
detail until he returns to D.C.,

05:21.188 --> 05:24.358
and he is specifically requested
that our team do the honors.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.693
He requested us?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.595
But since when did
we become babysitters?

05:27.595 --> 05:30.330
Hey, Laura, if our work
is getting noticed in D.C.,

05:30.330 --> 05:31.799
that's a good thing, right?

05:31.799 --> 05:34.067
Now, I've already contacted
his office for a list of people

05:34.067 --> 05:35.936
who may have posed threats
against him.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.938
Carter, you and Simone
are on 24-hour watch

05:37.938 --> 05:40.441
over the congressman
until he leaves tomorrow, okay?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.410
Laura, Brendon,
you take point on this bombing.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.078
You find the bomber,
you eliminate that threat.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.113
Got it.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.615
And what are you
going to be doing?

05:47.615 --> 05:49.116
I will be drinking
a green juice,

05:49.116 --> 05:51.118
followed by 10 minutes
of guided meditation.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.924
Antoinette. Hi.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.059
Just checking to see if you have
the bomb fragments already.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.327
Just logging them in.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.729
Going to take some time
to analyze,

06:01.729 --> 06:03.431
but these parts
look rudimentary.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.466
Possibly the work
of an amateur.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.438
Great minds.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.774
For instance, this is part of a
cheap radio-controlled receiver.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.242
It must have been
on the same frequency

06:15.242 --> 06:16.477
as the driver's key fob,

06:16.477 --> 06:18.111
which is why
it detonated the bomb.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.913
So I'll attempt to source
the components

06:19.913 --> 06:22.249
and search for prints, biologicals.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.951
Text you
if anything pops.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.119
Sounds good.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.721
Thank you. Mm.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.624
So <i>that's</i> the tea.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.892
Hmm?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.261
All of the FBI units in L.A.,

06:34.261 --> 06:36.830
and the congressman
requests <i>our</i> team.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.365
Don't you find that
strange?

06:38.365 --> 06:41.969
Uh, I find it strange
that you're selling us short.

06:41.969 --> 06:45.573
I mean, for a new team
that includes two rookie agents,

06:45.573 --> 06:49.409
hm, we've been kicking ass
and taking names.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.311
Probably did his homework.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.815
Yeah.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.885
What are you doing,
and where the hell

06:57.885 --> 06:59.720
did you get that perfume?

06:59.720 --> 07:02.856
I keep a beauty go-bag
in the glove compartment

07:02.856 --> 07:05.125
in case I ever need
a little refresh.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.961
Do I have to remind you
this is a job, not a date?

07:07.961 --> 07:09.563
You're damn right
it's not a date.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.732
I wouldn't give
him the satis--

07:13.767 --> 07:15.302
Is there something
you need to disclose?

07:16.837 --> 07:19.773
Don't tell me you know
the congressman socially.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.545
Let me remind you, lying is
the number-one sin in the FBI.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.547
Okay.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.348
Well, then, yeah,
kinda sorta.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.250
How "kinda sorta?"

07:30.250 --> 07:32.185
We hooked up once
or twice.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.055
Okay. Actually, two dozen times
when I lived in D.C.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.525
The man ain't lying when he says
he supports feminism

07:37.525 --> 07:39.359
'cause it was
crazy sexual equality--

07:39.359 --> 07:41.495
All right, enough.
Sorry I asked.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.831
But I do need to know
if anything's still going on.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.233
I haven't spoken to him
in over a year, Carter.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.302
But you know how it is
when you see your ex-piece.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.172
They need to know
what they missing.

07:52.172 --> 07:55.809
I suppose it's not exactly
a conflict of interest,

07:55.809 --> 07:57.210
but still a cause
for concern.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.547
You need to be professional, Simone.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.981
When am I not?

08:02.783 --> 08:06.754
This morning was
terrifying, almost deadly,

08:06.754 --> 08:08.922
but not as deadly
as millions of Americans

08:08.922 --> 08:11.224
without adequate
health insurance.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.595
And that's why I'm not gonna let
anyone scare me off my message.

08:14.595 --> 08:18.599
The risk is worth it.
But that's me.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.601
It doesn't have to be you.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.270
Folks, your safety
is everything to me.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.372
So if anyone feels

08:25.372 --> 08:27.575
uncomfortable working here
right now,

08:27.575 --> 08:29.309
it's okay to leave.
I understand.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.478
We're not going anywhere,
Damien. Right?

08:34.548 --> 08:37.618
Thank you. Thank you.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.587
Okay, then.
Back to work.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.388
We have to sell
the congressman's bill

08:41.388 --> 08:43.857
to the country before it
goes into committee.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.292
Feds, I presume.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.527
Special Agent Carter Hope, Congressman.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.429
Please,
please call me Damien.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.632
And this is Emma Taylor,
my chief of staff.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.966
Hello.
Hi.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.602
And who might you be?

08:54.602 --> 08:56.036
Cut the act, Damien.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.238
I already disclosed
our little history.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.973
Ah. I told Emma, too.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.976
Our unit is already
exploring the bombing.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.812
We'll have a team sweep
your home and this office

09:04.812 --> 09:06.379
for surveillance devices.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.181
Carter and I will drive you
to all your events,

09:08.181 --> 09:10.383
and we will guard you
in public places.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.352
Stay close
and do as you're told.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.520
We'll need to see
your schedule.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.122
Oh, here.
I'll give you a copy.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.657
Thank you, Emma.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.762
Do as I'm told?

09:21.762 --> 09:24.097
I almost forgot
how feisty you can be.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.833
Forget nothing.

09:25.833 --> 09:29.136
Not a day goes by
you don't think on all of this.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.204
I admit nothing.

09:31.204 --> 09:34.174
Except for the fact
that you've already made

09:34.174 --> 09:36.409
a reputation
for saving the day.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.678
Something going on?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.012
Absolutely nothing.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.714
What's on the agenda?

09:40.714 --> 09:42.850
Uh, next up,
the congressman has an event

09:42.850 --> 09:44.284
at St. Stephen's Hospital.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.953
The healthcare
leadership speech.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.254
Yeah, we're gonna
need specifics--

09:47.254 --> 09:48.756
Who organized it?
Who was invited?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.590
Is any security in place?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.125
Settle down, people.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.494
So, after
sifting through threats

09:54.494 --> 09:55.963
from the online bots, trolls,

09:55.963 --> 09:57.798
and foreign disinformation campaigns,

09:57.798 --> 09:59.466
there are four credible
bombing subjects

09:59.466 --> 10:02.269
in the Los Angeles area--

10:02.269 --> 10:04.471
Oswald Largent,
a doomsday prepper

10:04.471 --> 10:06.774
and anti-government
conspiracy theorist,

10:06.774 --> 10:08.441
Teddy Booker, who has ties

10:08.441 --> 10:12.045
to the far-right militant group
The Citizen's Freedom Movement,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.147
and Becky-Lynn Douglas
and Melanie White,

10:14.147 --> 10:16.016
both radical
conservative influencers

10:16.016 --> 10:18.652
who have posted threats
against Congressman Roberts.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.254
Now, they all have means
and access.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.724
Well, Becky-Lynn certainly
has the motivation to do it.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.294
<i>All right, get out of my way.
Get out of my way. I got this.</i>

10:32.599 --> 10:35.869
Now, my initial profiles
are the women

10:35.869 --> 10:38.271
are suburban armchair pundits,

10:38.271 --> 10:39.873
all bluster, no muster.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.009
And the doomsday prepper,

10:42.009 --> 10:43.944
he barely gets out
in the sunlight.

10:43.944 --> 10:47.280
But then there is Booker.
Now, he could be our unsub.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.615
What makes you say that?

10:48.615 --> 10:49.883
His word choice.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.252
He's detailed, articulate, educated,

10:52.252 --> 10:54.621
which makes what he says
all the more frightening.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.757
He believes every word
of his threats.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.658
And has quite the rap sheet--
assaults,

10:58.658 --> 11:00.293
illegal firearm charges.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.762
Okay, go talk to him.
See what you can shake out.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.263
But be careful. Tac up.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.065
Yeah.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.501
FBI!

11:11.705 --> 11:14.541
Uh... you got a warrant?

11:14.541 --> 11:18.111
No, but we can come back
with one and 15 more agents.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.546
Might make
a bit of a mess.

11:19.546 --> 11:20.914
Or we can
have a quick chat now.

11:20.914 --> 11:24.384
Fine.
Let me put on some pants.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.025
♪ Got tricked by a pretty lie

11:32.025 --> 11:34.895

11:34.895 --> 11:36.563
Hey, stop!

11:36.563 --> 11:38.598
You go.
I'll try to head him off.

Did he pass you?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.565
No.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.776
There's a lot of guns and ammo,
but no bomb-making material.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.512
Well, maybe he keeps
his explosives somewhere else.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.547
Oh, and check out
his writings.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.649
This guy goes way beyond obsessing

12:29.649 --> 12:31.251
over harming
the congressman.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.720
He's also
very into cosplay.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.688
Hmm?

12:37.724 --> 12:40.660
Ah.
A man of many faces.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.329
And identities, yeah.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.630
Oh, look.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.799
Fake I.D.
to St. Stephen Hospital.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.635
The congressman has an event
there. We should go.

12:48.635 --> 12:52.139
Your revised talking points.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.975
Healthcare as a human right, check,

12:54.975 --> 12:57.277
broken system,
prescription drugs.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.146
This is still
too generic.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.048
Where's my Aunt Winnie May's
cancer story?

13:01.048 --> 13:03.283
Oh, I love that story.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.784
Especially
how she made wigs

13:04.784 --> 13:06.786
for all the chemo patients
at her clinic.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.356
I put your aunt's story
right at the end.

13:09.356 --> 13:12.725
It's heartwarming, Damien.
You should open with it.

13:12.725 --> 13:16.363
Agree. I'll launch
with Winnie May.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.298
How would
<i>you</i> like to close?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.967
Personal and immediate.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.035
My driver is recovering
at this very hospital

13:22.035 --> 13:23.937
from a car bomb
intended for me.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.705
I'm gonna tell Tony's story
and how I'm paying

13:25.705 --> 13:28.441
his medical costs
his insurance doesn't cover.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.144
Then I will close
with inspiring people

13:31.144 --> 13:33.780
to imagine a world
with single-pay healthcare.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.918
Laura, you're on speaker
with Simone,

13:37.918 --> 13:39.519
the congressman,
and his chief of staff.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.688
We may have identified
our unsub.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.190
Teddy Booker.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.557
Sending his photo now.

13:46.894 --> 13:47.961
You recognize him?

13:47.961 --> 13:49.529
No.
Not at all.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.464
Oh, it makes sense.
He wears disguises.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.699
We found racks
full of costumes

13:52.699 --> 13:54.501
and a fake I.D.
to St. Stephen's Hospital.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.869
He-- He may show up.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.737
We have to cancel this
appearance. It's too high-risk.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.639
My whole career
is high risk.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.341
I've managed crackpots

14:01.341 --> 14:02.976
the day I announced
my candidacy.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.245
<i>I get that, but our job
is to protect you, sir.</i>

14:05.245 --> 14:07.547
<i>And my job
is to lead and inspire.</i>

14:07.547 --> 14:08.982
<i>You do yours,
I'll do mine.</i>

14:08.982 --> 14:10.317
Damien,
be reasonable.

14:10.317 --> 14:13.186
I will not be deterred
by hate.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.255
Okay, but we're not
leaving your side.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.858
We're on our way.
And we'll call for more backup.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.393
See?

14:20.393 --> 14:23.763
This right here is why
I broke up with you.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.065
Excuse me?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.766
You don't listen.
You're stubborn.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.169
I see you study
revisionist history.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.470
I broke up with <i>you.</i>

14:30.470 --> 14:32.940
Uh, boo,
you may recall our fight

14:32.940 --> 14:35.842
at The Capital Grille
when you laid out your terms

14:35.842 --> 14:38.845
and I refused them because
no one dictates my life.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.847
Except me, who can fire you
for any reason.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.449
Now, we have
a credible threat.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.517
Are you willing
to comport yourself or not?

14:44.517 --> 14:45.752
Yes, sir.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.122
Because I'm not the one
who got dumped.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.393
What the hell?
What is it?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.528
My old agent just wrote,
"Hope you're doing okay,"

14:55.528 --> 14:58.731
and my dad said, "Any publicity
is good publicity."

14:58.731 --> 15:00.000
What the hell's going on?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.434
I don't know,
and I don't care.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.270
Right now, neither do you.
Put your phone away.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.005
Oh, right, sorry.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.675
Not because the patients she
treated didn't make it, no.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.110
Okay.
What are we looking for?

15:10.110 --> 15:12.279
All right, we always start
with the three A's--

15:12.279 --> 15:14.781
assess, aim, adapt.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.650
What ate at her were the
patients she didn't get to treat

15:17.650 --> 15:19.486
because they lacked
health insurance.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.254
First, we assess
the location.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.290
Three entries,
three exits.
Mm-hmm.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.657
Was my mama alone in this,

15:24.657 --> 15:26.259
or does it break
your hearts, too?

15:26.259 --> 15:28.561
And aim?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.297
Minimize
the congressman's exposure.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.099
That's why we placed him at
the north side of the lobby

15:32.099 --> 15:33.400
so we can see all the exits.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.468
Very good.
And adapt?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.570
Be ready for it all
to go to hell.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.411
...in a modern
society-- in a moral society.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.116

16:06.033 --> 16:07.667
Is all this necessary?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.003
That's what you say to me
after I just saved your ass?

16:10.003 --> 16:11.338
Technically, Carter did most
of the saving.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.540
Wow. Unbelievable.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.842

Does anybody have eyes

16:31.158 --> 16:33.626
Okay, get into the van.
Come on!

16:33.626 --> 16:36.629
Damien, remember when we used
to go to the Rosebar in D.C.?

16:36.629 --> 16:38.665
What did I always tell you

in the boiler room.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.593
The congressman
is secure.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.003
That was
a pretty bold scheme

17:17.003 --> 17:19.872
you and your boys
tried to pull off, Mr. Booker.

17:22.008 --> 17:26.713
Arresting a few patriots is not
gonna stop the revolution.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.750
The Great Reset
will take this nation by storm.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.719
Great Reset.
Huh. Okay.

17:32.719 --> 17:37.357
How about kidnapping
Congressman Roberts, huh?

17:37.357 --> 17:39.459
Is that part
of the Great Reset?

17:39.459 --> 17:40.593
It was only the beginning.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.162
Wasn't the beginning
planting that bomb

17:42.162 --> 17:44.697
on the congressman's vehicle
this morning?

17:44.697 --> 17:48.135
You think that was us?

17:48.135 --> 17:51.304
The Citizen's Freedom Movement
had nothing to do with that.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.406
We're supposed to just take
your word for it, right?

17:53.406 --> 17:56.376
Is that it?
Our plan was to film him

17:56.376 --> 17:59.179
recanting
his radical socialist agenda.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.314
Kill him?

18:01.314 --> 18:02.649
Please.

18:02.649 --> 18:06.153
He's worth much more
to the revolution alive.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.728
Okay, what is going on?
Is there an emergency?

18:15.728 --> 18:18.798
Yes.
Well, no. Kind of.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.567
You know my ex-girlfriend,
Heather Jacobs?

18:20.567 --> 18:21.834
The model?
Yeah.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.336
So apparently,
she wrote a memoir.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.338
She dropped
a couple of chapters online.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.006
Mm. I take it you don't
come off well.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.408
Uh, no.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.942
She wrote that I'm
a narcissistic serial dater

18:29.942 --> 18:31.511
who's deathly afraid
of being alone,

18:31.511 --> 18:34.113
oh, and-- and needs constant
validation in order to breathe.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.916
What? That's not funny.
Sorry. No, not funny.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.618
No, I-- Just-- I don't like
my personal business

18:38.618 --> 18:40.119
being blasted out
around the world.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.654
You know, people here just
stopped-- Hey--

18:41.654 --> 18:43.223
talking about
"Vampire Cop."

18:43.223 --> 18:44.291
I just-- You know,
I don't like the office--

18:44.291 --> 18:45.925
Would you relax?
What?

18:45.925 --> 18:48.060
No one here even remotely cares
about your personal life.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.397
Hey, hey, hey, Elena.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.399

of an amateur.

on purpose to confuse us

29:22.661 --> 29:24.696
I can get used to this.

29:26.698 --> 29:29.335
Maybe a couple brushes
with death

29:29.335 --> 29:32.571
can make a man
appreciate the finer things.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.709
Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm.
Okay, okay.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.012
Enough of that.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.680
Go get
your fine ass dressed.

29:41.680 --> 29:45.451
Go on.
Shoo, fly, shoo.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.819
Boss, you need to see this.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.654
One of the congressman's
attempted kidnappers

29:48.654 --> 29:50.556
did some recon at the site
of his first speech.

29:50.556 --> 29:51.991
Got it all on video.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.659
Oh, can we see them
plant the bomb?

29:53.659 --> 29:55.327
Yeah. Just watch.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.800
I almost missed it
the first time,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.035
but watch when he pans.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.543
So they're not
the bombers.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.712
No. He is.

30:13.712 --> 30:14.847
Okay, Brendon,
put out a BOLO

30:14.847 --> 30:16.515
and check all surveillance
cameras in the area.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.217
We might get lucky.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.785
Laura, go update
Carter and Simone.

30:19.785 --> 30:21.020
Yeah.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.789
Our unsub
is still at large.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.025
Good morning, Emma.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.359
Good morning.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.863
And how are you
this morning?

30:30.863 --> 30:33.165
Simone is in the house with me
and not outside in the car

30:33.165 --> 30:35.801
because we were going over
the day's schedule.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.569
If you were wondering.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.138
I wasn't. But okay.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.807
Get down!

30:53.119 --> 30:53.886
Three assassination attempts
in two days.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.189
Damien, we're canceling
the rest of the L.A. itinerary.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.525
Why don't the two of you
come back to our field office

30:59.525 --> 31:01.327
until your flight
back to D.C. tonight?

31:01.327 --> 31:03.562
Yeah. It's gonna be the safest
place for you right now.

31:03.562 --> 31:06.232
Damien, you go.
I'll head back to the office.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.534
I don't want this stealing focus
from your healthcare initiative.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.404
Appreciate you.
We'll get through this.

31:13.772 --> 31:15.641
We need to get you
to safety.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.177
Simone.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.079
Just curious--
when the shooting happened,

31:20.079 --> 31:22.314
why were you
in the congressman's house?

31:22.314 --> 31:26.318
Coffee. Do you really need
to know anything else?

31:26.318 --> 31:28.220
No.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.222
But can't say the same
for Carter.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.557
He's waiting for you back
in the office.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.397
Hey, Antoinette. Hey.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.866
So I-I-I thought a lot
about our conversation,

31:40.866 --> 31:42.268
and I respect
your decision.

31:42.268 --> 31:45.337
Thank you.
Will you answer
these two questions?

31:45.337 --> 31:46.772
Excuse me?
Just two questions.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.074
Come on. Humor me.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.175
Hey, Bob. Hey.

31:49.175 --> 31:52.278
So, one, do you like
spending time with me?

31:52.278 --> 31:53.879
Yes.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.647
Okay. Yes. There you go. Amazing.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.683
And, two,
will you regret it

31:57.683 --> 32:00.586
if you don't at least
try to give us a chance?

32:02.554 --> 32:03.822
You know what?
You don't have to answer.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.993
Just take your time.
Think about it.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.165
It's a blank screen.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.134
I am being bombarded
by messages.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.336
Is there a space where I can
return some e-mails, calls?

32:17.336 --> 32:18.670
Uh,
the fishbowl is open.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.472
All right. Thanks.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.641
Mm.

32:22.641 --> 32:26.979
He is fronting like he's brave,
but inside, that man is rattled.

32:26.979 --> 32:29.548
You determine that when you were
in his house this morning,

32:29.548 --> 32:31.583
bonding over your coffee?

32:33.485 --> 32:34.987
Would you like me to tell you
what happened, Carter?

32:34.987 --> 32:36.288
I already know.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.823
What if the killer came back
last night

32:37.823 --> 32:40.092
and caught you with your guard
and pants down?

32:40.092 --> 32:41.593
At best, you've embarrassed
the Bureau.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.996
At worst,
you're both dead.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.764
You're right.

32:45.764 --> 32:47.966
You got lucky.

32:51.770 --> 32:52.971
Think about it, though, Carter.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.941
W-W-Was it luck?

32:55.941 --> 33:00.346
I mean, I was alone
with Damien last night.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.181
The unsub could have come
at any time.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.483
But he waited for
the sun to rise?

33:04.483 --> 33:06.718
Why?
Our unsub isn't a pro.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.320
Remember,
the bomb was basic,

33:08.320 --> 33:10.156
and shooting at a target
through a window from a car

33:10.156 --> 33:12.358
is a terrible idea,
tactically speaking.

33:12.358 --> 33:15.894
No. But it seems
like we're missing something.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.897
I'm protecting him
last night,

33:18.897 --> 33:20.999
but they don't show up
to attack

33:20.999 --> 33:23.001
until after Emma
gets there?

33:23.001 --> 33:25.071
Shots rang out
when she was there,

33:25.071 --> 33:27.839
and the bomb was in a car
she was about to get into.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.210
Damien has had so many
death threats against him

33:31.210 --> 33:34.380
that if an unsub killed him
and Emma was with him,

33:34.380 --> 33:36.615
people would just assume
she was collateral damage.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.517
And no one would look
into who would want <i>her</i> dead.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.019
Damn.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.988
There is no way
this is about Emma.

33:42.988 --> 33:45.624
How much do you know about her?
I mean her personal life.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.893
I-I-Is she going through
a bad breakup,

33:47.893 --> 33:49.395
having a problem
with her family,

33:49.395 --> 33:51.063
her-- her finances?
No.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.065
But, you know, there was this
one thing, about a year ago.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.667
She was driving home
from a fundraiser.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.237
It was late, and she
accidentally hit a young man

33:58.237 --> 33:59.371
running across Sunset.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.572
He was only 19 years old.

34:00.572 --> 34:01.907
He wasn't in a crosswalk.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.542
He died at the scene.
Hit and run?

34:03.542 --> 34:05.277
No. She called
the police immediately.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.279
There were witnesses
that backed her story,

34:07.279 --> 34:09.047
and the police report
said that she was

34:09.047 --> 34:10.949
completely sober.
Were charges filed?

34:10.949 --> 34:12.284
No.
It was a tragic accident.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.620
But, you know, a couple months
ago, the boy's father,

34:14.620 --> 34:15.754
he launched
a civil suit against her,

34:15.754 --> 34:17.356
but a judge
dismissed it.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.191
Carter, this is the kind
of thing

34:19.191 --> 34:21.193
a-a-a grieving father
would do.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.262
I mean, he's hurt.
He's vengeful.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.596
You know his name?

34:24.596 --> 34:25.797
The father?
No idea.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.900
But the boy, I believe it was,
um, Connor.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.935
Connor Morgan.

34:29.935 --> 34:31.803
We've got a list
of over 10,000 people

34:31.803 --> 34:34.206
who purchased a part
that was used in the bomb.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.674
Call Emma right now.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.709
And there's one Morgan--
Ian Morgan.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.245
Could be him.
Went straight to voicemail.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.546
Let's go.
I'm coming.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.013
You stay here.
I'm coming.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.783
No, you're not.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.478
Carter, that's him.

35:15.581 --> 35:16.915
He's got a gun!

35:16.915 --> 35:18.750
You're--
You're Connor's father.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.152
I'm sorry.
FBI!

35:22.221 --> 35:24.323
Mr. Morgan,
drop your weapon!
No.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.757
We know what happened
with your son.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.159
It was an accident.

35:27.159 --> 35:29.395
Ran him over like a dog
and then tried to cover it up.

35:29.395 --> 35:30.729
That's not what happened.

35:30.729 --> 35:33.732
Please.
Please.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.803
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this!

35:39.605 --> 35:42.107
I had to be clever.

35:42.107 --> 35:44.075
I had to be clever,
had to be clever

35:44.075 --> 35:46.011
and kill her when she's
with the congressman.

35:46.011 --> 35:47.779
And nobody would suspect that.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.948
Losing a child
is the most painful thing

35:49.948 --> 35:51.183

35:51.183 --> 35:52.851
You're broken.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.288
Don't do this.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.056
I just wanted to--
to get away with it

35:58.056 --> 36:00.692
like she got away
with killing my son.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.528
Look at me.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.630
Connor loved you.
