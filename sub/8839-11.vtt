01:50.693 --> 01:51.735
WHAT DID
YOU GET?

01:51.903 --> 01:52.903
A "D."

01:53.071 --> 01:56.073
THAT'S NOT SO BAD,
I GOT AN "F" MINUS.

[LAUGHTER]

01:58.326 --> 01:59.660
[TEACHER TAPPING ON DESK]

01:59.828 --> 02:02.246
I CAN ASSURE YOU IT'S
NO LAUGHING MATTER,

02:02.413 --> 02:06.875
AS AT LEAST SOME
OF YOU IN THE CLASS
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.586
Mrs. Garvey:
I'D LIKE TO PARTICULARLY
COMMEND ALBERT INGALLS

02:09.754 --> 02:13.340
FOR HIS OUTSTANDING WORK--
ALL GOLD STARS.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.384
CONGRATULATIONS, ALBERT.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.970
Mrs. Garvey:
YES, NELLIE?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.973
Nellie: WASN'T MY
WORK OUTSTANDING,
TOO, MRS. GARVEY?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.267
Mrs. Garvey: YES, NELLIE,
YOUR WORK WAS EXCELLENT.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.602
THANK YOU,
MRS. GARVEY.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.272
Mrs. Garvey: STARTING
TOMORROW, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE DAILY TESTS

02:28.439 --> 02:29.773
FOR GRADES 4 AND UP.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.108
- Child: WOW.
- Second child: BOO.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.569
Mrs. Garvey: IT'S FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD, REALLY.

02:33.736 --> 02:36.697
EVERYONE'S GRADES
ARE GOING TO BE POSTED
ON THE BLACKBOARD.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.658
DO YOU HAVE TO PUT
THE GRADES ON THE
BOARD, MS. GARVEY?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.451
YES, WILLIE.
THAT WAY,
EACH ONE OF YOU

02:41.619 --> 02:43.912
CAN FOLLOW THE PROGRESS
OF THE WHOLE CLASS.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.415
IT'LL JUST SHOW EVERYBODY
HOW DUMB I AM!

[LAUGHTER]

02:48.001 --> 02:49.209
[TAPPING ON DESK]

02:49.377 --> 02:53.672
YOU'RE NOT DUMB, WILLIE,
YOU'RE JUST LAZY,

02:53.840 --> 02:56.842
AS ARE OTHERS
IN THIS CLASS
WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS,

02:57.010 --> 02:59.678
SINCE THEY MUST KNOW
WHO THEY ARE.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.307
NOW, THE PRELIMINARY
TESTS SHOULD PREPARE YOU

03:03.474 --> 03:07.060
FOR THE FINAL, MAJOR TEST
AT THE END OF THE TERM.

03:07.228 --> 03:11.023
IT'LL BE IN TWO PARTS
ON THE LAST WEDNESDAY
AND FRIDAY,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.900
AND THE RESULTS WILL
LARGELY DETERMINE

03:13.067 --> 03:17.613
WHETHER YOU ARE PROMOTED TO
THE NEXT GRADE OR LEFT BACK.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.406

03:19.574 --> 03:22.451
ANDREW, I'D LIKE
A WORD WITH YOU,
PLEASE.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.457
YES, MA'AM?

03:28.625 --> 03:31.084
YOUR HOMEWORK WAS
ONE OF THE WORST
IN THE CLASS.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.253
WHAT ON EARTH'S
BEEN HAPPENING
TO YOU?

03:33.421 --> 03:35.339
I DON'T KNOW.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.965
I STUDY.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.133
YOU SEE ME AT HOME.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.509
YES, I SEE YOU WITH
YOUR BOOKS OPEN,

03:39.677 --> 03:40.928
BUT HALF THE TIME,
YOU'RE DAYDREAMING,

03:41.095 --> 03:43.847
OR YOUR EYES ARE
WANDERING OFF
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.141
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
IS APPLY YOURSELF,

03:46.309 --> 03:49.436
CONCENTRATE ON
YOUR STUDIES THE WAY
ALBERT INGALLS DOES.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.022
ALBERT DOESN'T
STUDY THAT MUCH.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.732
IT JUST COMES
EASY TO HIM.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.651
WELL, IT OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T COME EASY
TO YOU,

03:55.818 --> 03:58.111
SO, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO IT
LONGER AND HARDER.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.696
YES, MA'AM.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.157
AND THERE'S NO BETTER
TIME TO START THAN
RIGHT NOW, IS THERE?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.617
NO, MA'AM.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.661
SO, I WANT YOU TO GO
STRAIGHT HOME AND
DO YOUR HOMEWORK

04:05.828 --> 04:10.624
BEFORE ANY PLAY
AND BEFORE
YOUR CHORES.

AIN'T YOU COMING?

04:12.377 --> 04:14.378
AREN'T YOU COMING.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.129
AREN'T YOU COMING?

04:16.297 --> 04:17.547
IN A WHILE.
YOU RUN ALONG.

04:17.715 --> 04:20.342
I HAVE TO PICK UP
SOME THINGS AT
THE MERCANTILE.

Andrew: I WISH MOM
NEVER TOOK THAT JOB.

04:37.735 --> 04:38.735

TO HELP.

OF A TEACHER,
ANDY,

AN EXAMPLE
FOR THE OTHERS.

PICKING ON ME.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.166
WELL, SHE JUST WANTS
YOU TO DO WELL.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.918
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
STUDY A LITTLE MORE.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.920
YOU SOUND JUST
LIKE MY MA.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.339
WELL, LAURA IS
RIGHT, ANDY.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.550
I STUDY AS
HARD AS I CAN.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.095
AND WHO ASKED FOR
YOUR TWO CENTS,
ANYWAYS?

05:05.263 --> 05:06.805
WHAT'D YOU
DO THAT FOR?

05:06.973 --> 05:09.099
FOR MAKING THE REST
OF US LOOK STUPID,

05:09.267 --> 05:11.059
AND FOR PUTTING ME IN
HOT WATER WITH MY MOM.

FAULT HE'S SMART.

05:17.608 --> 05:20.152

FIGHT WITH YOU, ANDY.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.571
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

COME ON,
LET'S GO HOME.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.466
AND SO, NELLIE
WAS TELLING ME

05:42.633 --> 05:45.344
THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO BEGIN A SERIES
OF TESTS.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.803
YES, STARTING
TOMORROW.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.138
OH, AND A CAN
OF PEACHES.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.264
AH.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.515
NOW, I KNOW THAT
YOU WON'T MIND

05:50.683 --> 05:52.476
IF I OFFER YOU A LITTLE
FRIENDLY ADVICE--

05:52.643 --> 05:54.394
NOT CRITICISM,
MIND YOU--

05:54.562 --> 05:56.438
BUT I WAS THINKING,
WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL

05:56.606 --> 06:00.901
IF YOU AWARDED THE STUDENT
WHO COMES IN FIRST IN
THE FINAL EXAMINATIONS

06:01.069 --> 06:02.152
A LITTLE PRIZE,

06:02.320 --> 06:04.821
SORT OF LIKE
A LITTLE REWARD?

06:04.989 --> 06:06.990
I LIKE TO THINK
THAT LEARNING--

06:07.158 --> 06:09.743
EDUCATION--
IS ITS OWN REWARD.

06:11.996 --> 06:15.624
SOMETHING LIKE A NICE,
BIG, BLUE RIBBON.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.627
WELL, I'LL EVEN DONATE IT.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.961
Mrs. Oleson:
OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T
BE A BIT SURPRISED

06:20.129 --> 06:21.671
IF MY NELLIE WON IT.

06:21.839 --> 06:25.175
I DON'T LIKE TO BRIBE
THE STUDENTS FOR THEIR
EFFORTS, MRS. OLESON.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.263

MAY I REMIND YOU

06:30.431 --> 06:33.475
THAT I AM ON
THE SCHOOL BOARD?

06:33.643 --> 06:36.812
Mrs. Oleson:
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THE STANDARDS RAISED.

06:36.979 --> 06:40.315
THEREFORE, THERE WILL BE
A BLUE RIBBON DONATED,

06:40.483 --> 06:43.276
AND IT WILL BE AWARDED.

06:45.196 --> 06:49.074
NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED,
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT I CAN GET YOU?

06:50.368 --> 06:53.078
NO, THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.

06:53.246 --> 06:57.541

BE $1.17, PLEASE.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.209

06:59.377 --> 07:00.794
OH, YES.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.713

ALSO THAT--

07:03.881 --> 07:07.384
THAT YOUR ANDREW
IS DOING VERY
POORLY IN SCHOOL.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.095
TSK, TSK, TSK,
SUCH A SHAME.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.680
IT'S EVEN
MORE OF A SHAME

07:11.848 --> 07:14.766
THAT YOUR WILLIE IS DOING
FAR WORSE THAN ANDREW.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.395
YES, POOR LITTLE TYKE.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.689

07:20.857 --> 07:24.443
Mrs. Oleson:
BUT I DO FEEL SO SORRY
FOR YOU, MY DEAR.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.319
WHY, IT MUST BE
SO EMBARRASSING

07:26.487 --> 07:30.615
TO HAVE YOUR OWN
SON DOING SO BADLY.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.243
I'D BE WILLING TO HELP
ANDY, MRS. GARVEY.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.619
[SIGHS]
I SHOULD THINK

07:34.787 --> 07:36.913
YOU'D HAVE
YOUR HANDS FILLED
HELPING WILLIE.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.582
OH, NO ONE CAN
HELP WILLIE.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.083
HE'S HOPELESS.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.419
[CHUCKLES]

07:42.587 --> 07:45.922
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, NELLIE,
BUT NO, THANK YOU.

07:46.090 --> 07:51.261
ANDREW ASSURES ME
THAT HE'LL STUDY
HARD TO DO BETTER.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.762
GOOD DAY.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.391
Mrs. Oleson: GOOD DAY.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.188
WELL, MY.

08:01.355 --> 08:04.191
THAT WAS KIND
OF YOU, NELLIE.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.359
JUST TRYING TO BE
A GOOD NEIGHBOR,

08:06.527 --> 08:08.028
OH...

08:10.698 --> 08:12.157
Mrs. Garvey:
[MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY]

08:12.325 --> 08:13.450
[DOOR SLAMS]

08:16.120 --> 08:17.329
I THOUGHT I HEARD
A STORM BLOW IN.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.206
SOMETIMES, I WONDER
HOW HARRIET OLESON

08:19.373 --> 08:21.917
HAS MANAGED TO
STAY ALIVE FOR
AS LONG AS SHE HAS.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.460
Mr. Garvey:
WHAT'D SHE DO NOW?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.378
SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.256
FOR THAT MATTER,
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

08:28.424 --> 08:30.800
NOTHING I DIDN'T
ALREADY KNOW MYSELF.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.554
BUT IT'S HER WAY
OF SAYING THINGS.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.264
TROUBLE WAS, SHE'S RIGHT.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.350
SHE WAS RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.936
ABOUT ANDY DOING
SO POORLY IN SCHOOL.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.687
ALICE, THE BOY'S DOING
THE BEST HE CAN.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.273
Alice: WELL, HE'S GOING TO HAVE
TO DO BETTER, MUCH BETTER.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.984
HE'S IN HIS ROOM RIGHT NOW,
POUNDING ON THE BOOKS.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.653
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE

08:49.820 --> 08:50.904
TO HAVE THE SON
OF THE TEACHER

08:51.072 --> 08:52.739
NEAR THE BOTTOM
OF THE CLASS?

08:56.035 --> 08:57.827
MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE
HIM SOME EXTRA HELP.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.788
JONATHAN, I JUST
DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.581
I HAVE TO GRADE THE
PAPERS AND THE TESTS,

09:01.749 --> 09:02.999
PREPARE THE NEXT
DAY'S WORK,

09:03.167 --> 09:05.126
AND RUN THIS
HOUSE, AS WELL.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.712
LORD KNOWS I CAN'T
HELP HIM MUCH.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.924
I NEVER HAD MUCH
OF A CHANCE FOR
BOOK LEARNING.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.425
Alice: NELLIE
OFFERED TO HELP HIM.

09:12.593 --> 09:13.885
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HER UP ON IT?

09:14.053 --> 09:17.597
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T GIVE
HARRIET THE SATISFACTION.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.060
ALICE, WHEN IT COMES
RIGHT DOWN TO IT,
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT,

09:22.228 --> 09:25.397
HARRIET'S SATISFACTION
OR ANDY'S LEARNING?

09:27.984 --> 09:32.362
OF COURSE I'M MORE
CONCERNED ABOUT ANDY.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.490
WE'LL SEE HOW HE DOES
ON THE FIRST TEST.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.707
I'VE BEEN BUSTING
MY BRAINS,
AND I'M DOING WORSE.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.166
I GOT 100.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.961
IT'S EASY, WHEN YOU
KNOW HOW TO STUDY.

MRS. GARVEY.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.923
Mrs. Garvey: GOOD
AFTERNOON, NELLIE.

10:08.232 --> 10:11.192
HEY, ANDY, DID YOU
SEE MY GRADES?

10:11.360 --> 10:12.944
WHO WANTS TO SEE
YOUR GRADES?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.696
I GOT ENOUGH TROUBLES
OF MY OWN.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.239
OH, COME ON,
TAKE A LOOK.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.575
YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
HOW SMART YOU ARE.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.036
WHAT'S SMART?

10:21.203 --> 10:24.122
BOY, YOU GOT A 54.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.582
THAT'S WORSE THAN MINE.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.043
YEAH, DON'T KNOW
WHAT MY FOLKS WILL SAY

10:28.210 --> 10:30.086
WHEN THEY FIND OUT.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.755
GUESS WE'RE BOTH
IN TROUBLE.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.256
YEAH.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.931
HEY, YOU WANT TO GO
FROGGING, ANDY?

10:42.099 --> 10:43.600
IT'LL TAKE OUR
MINDS OFF IT.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.061
SURE, LET'S GO.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.113
WHAT YOU NEED, YOUNG MAN,
ARE GOOD STUDY HABITS.

10:57.281 --> 10:58.323
I WANT TO
LEARN, MA.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.699
THAT'S THE
SPIRIT, SON.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.327
BUT I GUESS I JUST
DON'T KNOW HOW, PA.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.787
I'LL GET SOMEONE
TO TEACH YOU.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.246
I COULD WORK REALLY
GOOD WITH ALBERT.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.998
Alice: HE'S THE LAST
ONE I'D SET YOU UP WITH.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.126
YOU'D BE OFF FISHING
OR FROGGING OR
GALLIVANTING AROUND,

11:10.294 --> 11:14.214
WHICH PROBABLY EXPLAINS
WHY ALBERT'S GRADES
HAVE DROPPED SO.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.676
PASS THE BUTTER,
WILL YOU, SON?

11:17.843 --> 11:20.595
NOW, I THINK WHAT YOU
NEED IS A REAL GOOD
STUDENT TO STUDY WITH.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.138
Mrs. Garvey:
AND RIGHT NOW,
BY FAR AND AWAY,

11:22.306 --> 11:24.474
THE BEST STUDENT
IN THE CLASS
IS NELLIE OLESON.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.642
NELLIE OLESON?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.143
AND WHATEVER YOU MAY
DISLIKE ABOUT HER--

11:27.311 --> 11:28.520
EVERYTHING.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.272
THE FACT REMAINS,
SHE IS STILL
CONSISTENTLY GETTING

11:31.440 --> 11:33.316
THE BEST MARKS
ON THE TESTS.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.194
TOMORROW, AFTER SCHOOL,

11:36.362 --> 11:40.490
I'M TAKING YOU OVER
TO THE MERCANTILE
TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.242
DO I HAVE TO?

11:47.456 --> 11:49.582
I WON'T HAVE YOU
CONTINUE TO DISGRACE ME

11:49.750 --> 11:54.838
WITH THE KIND OF MARKS
YOU'VE BEEN GETTING.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.757
NOW, EAT YOUR SUPPER.

[BELL JINGLES]

12:21.574 --> 12:22.657
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MRS. OLESON.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.870
AH, MRS. GARVEY,
MAY I HELP YOU?

12:27.037 --> 12:29.038
YES, I'LL GET
RIGHT TO THE POINT.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.709
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THE LITTLE TALK
WE HAD THE OTHER DAY.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.127
OH?

12:34.295 --> 12:38.798
YES, AND ANDY IS
CONTINUING TO HAVE
DIFFICULTIES IN SCHOOL--

12:38.966 --> 12:42.719
OH, YES, I KNOW,
NELLIE TOLD ME,
TSK, TSK, TSK.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.264
IT MUST MAKE YOU FEEL
VERY PROUD THAT
SHE CONFIDES IN YOU.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.935
WELL, SO FEW
PARENTS THESE DAYS

12:51.103 --> 12:55.231
HAVE THE TRUST
AND CONFIDENCE OF
THEIR CHILDREN.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.901
INDEED.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.488
WELL, I, UH--
I HAVE TO CONFESS
THAT I WAS WRONG

13:01.655 --> 13:04.115
AND YOU WERE SO
RIGHT IN SUGGESTING

13:04.283 --> 13:07.827
THAT NELLIE HELP ANDREW
WITH HIS SCHOOLWORK.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.913
Mrs. Garvey:
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D MIND

13:10.080 --> 13:12.999
IF I ACCEPTED NELLIE'S
GRACIOUS OFFER.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.085
WHY, NO, I DON'T
MIND AT ALL.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.378
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

13:17.546 --> 13:21.299
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
TO DO GOD'S WORK.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.801
GOD'S WORK?

13:22.968 --> 13:28.306
YES, AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE GIFTED TO HELP
THE LESS GIFTED.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.599
NELLIE, DARLING?

13:29.767 --> 13:30.767
Nellie: YES, MOTHER?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.018
Mrs. Oleson:
ARE YOU STILL WILLING

13:32.186 --> 13:33.686
TO HELP ANDREW
WITH HIS HOMEWORK?

13:33.854 --> 13:35.021
Nellie: OF COURSE.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.441
MRS. GARVEY, I'D
BE GLAD TO HELP ANDY

13:38.609 --> 13:40.193
ANY WAY I CAN.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.444
Mrs. Oleson:
ALL RIGHT, DARLING.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.779
I DON'T NEED ANY MORE
HELP DOWN HERE.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.113
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
ANDREW UP TO YOUR ROOM,

13:44.281 --> 13:46.115
AND YOU CAN BEGIN
YOUR STUDIES RIGHT NOW?

13:46.283 --> 13:47.659
YES, MOTHER.

13:57.461 --> 14:02.465
IMAGINE, MY NELLIE TEACHING
THE TEACHER'S SON.

14:02.633 --> 14:06.344
[LAUGHING]

14:06.512 --> 14:08.221
OH, FORGIVE ME.

14:12.476 --> 14:17.397
NOW, YOUR MOTHER FEELS
THAT YOUR GRADES
ARE HUMILIATING HER,

14:17.565 --> 14:19.107
AND SHE'S RIGHT.

14:19.275 --> 14:23.528
NORMALLY, I WOULD
REFUSE TO HELP ANYONE
WHO WON'T HELP HIMSELF,

14:23.696 --> 14:27.323
BUT IN YOUR CASE,
THERE ARE SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.784
WHAT SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES?

14:29.952 --> 14:32.161
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.664
DO YOU KNOW HOW I GET
SUCH GOOD GRADES?

14:34.832 --> 14:36.374
I GUESS SO.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.333
YOU STUDY HARD,

14:37.501 --> 14:39.168
AND YOU'RE
NATURALLY SMART.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.088
NO, I CHEAT.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.718
YOU CHEAT?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.428
WELL, OF COURSE.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.848
WHY?

14:52.016 --> 14:55.268
IF YOU'RE SMART,
YOU DON'T NEED TO.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.605
SMART HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.774
WHO CAN REMEMBER
ALL THOSE THINGS
THEY WANT YOU TO?

15:01.942 --> 15:04.027
JUST CLUTTERS THE MIND.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.863
WHEN YOU GROW UP,
YOU GOT TO KNOW FACTS.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.197
GEOGRAPHY--

15:08.365 --> 15:10.116
YOU CAN ALWAYS
LOOK THEM UP,

15:10.284 --> 15:12.952
THE WAY YOUR MOTHER DOES
WHEN SHE PREPARES
THE CLASS LESSONS.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.495
YOU'VE SEEN HER.

15:14.663 --> 15:18.541
SHE MAKES NOTES
AND LOOKS AT THEM
IN CLASS, DOESN'T SHE?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.043
YEAH.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.087
WELL, THEN WHY SHOULD
SHE EXPECT US TO KNOW
MORE THAN SHE DOES?

15:24.548 --> 15:25.506
BUT CHEATING--

15:25.674 --> 15:27.300
Nellie: I DON'T WANT
TO ARGUE ABOUT IT.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.385
IF YOU WANT ME TO
HELP YOU, ALL RIGHT.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.472
OR ELSE, GO HOME
AND TELL YOUR MOTHER
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.725
WELL, SUPPOSE I TOLD
HER YOU CHEATED?

15:35.893 --> 15:39.562
SHE WOULDN'T BELIEVE YOU,
AND YOU CAN'T PROVE IT,

15:39.730 --> 15:40.897
Nellie:
AND I'D JUST SAY
YOU'RE LYING

15:41.065 --> 15:42.899
BECAUSE YOU
WERE JEALOUS.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.736
JUDGE NOT, LEST
YE BE JUDGED.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.532
WELL?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.247
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

15:58.415 --> 16:00.625
PULL UP A CHAIR,
AND I'LL SHOW YOU.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.681
HOW ABOUT GOING
FROGGING AGAIN?

17:38.849 --> 17:41.059
I CAN'T.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.602

REGULAR BOOKWORM.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.525

17:49.693 --> 17:51.861
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
STOPPING US FROM
GOING FROGGING.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.030
EXCEPT YOUR GRADES.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.531
WHAT ABOUT MY GRADES?

17:55.699 --> 17:57.116
THEY STINK!

17:57.284 --> 17:58.367
WELL, THEY'RE MY GRADES,

17:58.535 --> 18:00.286
SO, YOU CAN
STOP WORRYING.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.538
I'M NOT GOING
FROGGING WITH YOU.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.040
WHY NOT?

18:04.208 --> 18:07.335
BECAUSE YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND STUDY, LIKE ANDY.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.921
YOU GO HOME AND STUDY.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.840

LIKE ME.

JONATHAN, TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS.

18:24.686 --> 18:26.395

18:26.563 --> 18:28.523

NOTE THE GRADE.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.275
[CHUCKLES]

18:31.443 --> 18:33.611
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
THAT ONE AFTERNOON
WITH NELLIE

18:33.779 --> 18:35.071
COULD MAKE SUCH
A DIFFERENCE?

18:35.239 --> 18:36.906
WELL, YOU'VE SURE
GOT TO GIVE HER
SOME CREDIT.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.200
AND YOUR SON, TOO.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.244

18:42.162 --> 18:43.079
YES'M?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.831
Mrs. Garvey: COME HERE
A MINUTE, PLEASE.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.295
OH, THAT'S TO SHOW YOU
HOW PLEASED I AM,

18:51.463 --> 18:53.422
AND I'M SURE YOUR
PA FEELS THE SAME.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.674
I SURE DO.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.551
CONGRATULATIONS--
A PERFECT PAPER.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.593
YOU THINK YOU
CAN KEEP THAT UP?

18:57.761 --> 18:59.053
OF COURSE HE CAN.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.596
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF APPLICATION,
ISN'T IT?

19:00.764 --> 19:01.764
I GUESS SO.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.307
HOW DID NELLIE
TEACH YOU?

19:03.475 --> 19:05.685
UH, SHE SAYS TO
WRITE THINGS DOWN.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.270
IT HELPS YOU
TO REMEMBER.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.523
AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

AS A REWARD,
ON SATURDAY,

YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANY CHORES AT ALL.

FISHING OR FROGGING OR

MAKE A MISTAKE
ONCE IN A WHILE,

FEEL BETTER.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.576
JUST A WASTE
OF TIME.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.579
DOES YOUR MOTHER HAVE
THE QUESTIONS READY
FOR THE BIG TEST YET?

21:30.747 --> 21:31.872

21:40.716 --> 21:42.967
YOU CAN, AND YOU WILL,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.720

I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

GO ON BEING PROUD

I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET AHOLD OF
THE QUESTIONS.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.877
SHE'D PROBABLY HIDE
THEM SOMEPLACE.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.587
THEN SPY ON HER.

I CAN'T PROMISE THAT.

24:39.436 --> 24:43.564
I WONDERED HOW
YOU GOT SO SMART
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.357
THEN I SAW
YOU YESTERDAY.

24:45.525 --> 24:48.319
DID ANYBODY ELSE?

24:48.487 --> 24:51.822
IS THAT ALL THAT'S
BOTHERING YOU?

24:51.990 --> 24:53.407
NO.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.122
WHY, ANDY?

25:00.290 --> 25:01.499

HOW COULD SHE MAKE YOU
DO A THING LIKE THAT?

IT JUST HAPPENED.

STUDY WITH HER

25:11.051 --> 25:12.843
SO I'D LEARN
GOOD WORK HABITS.

25:15.472 --> 25:19.308
SHE CHEATS, AND THEN
SHE SHOWED ME HOW.

25:19.476 --> 25:24.396
Andy: AND THEN SHE STARTED
THREATENING IF I DIDN'T.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.981
Andy: [SIGHS]

25:26.149 --> 25:27.233
Andy: MA WAS ASHAMED OF ME

AWFUL IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

YOU SHOULD TELL THEM.

THE WORST THEY CAN DO
IS GIVE YOU A LICKING.

IT IF YOUR PA AND MA

30:22.612 --> 30:24.112
I'M COMING.

30:40.129 --> 30:41.296
HI, PA!

30:41.464 --> 30:42.548
HEY, ALBERT.

30:42.715 --> 30:44.049
COULD USE A HAND
OUT HERE.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.509
YOU GOT TWO,
RIGHT HERE.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.636
OH, COME ON, YOU
JUST CHANGE YOUR
SCHOOL CLOTHES FIRST.

30:47.804 --> 30:48.804
OKAY.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.722
HOW DID YOU DO
ON THE BIG TEST?

30:50.890 --> 30:52.015
ABOUT AVERAGE,
I GUESS.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.142
BE RIGHT THERE.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.352
ALL RIGHT.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.520
AFTERNOON, LADIES.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.480
- HI, PA.
- HOW'D YOU DO ON THE TEST?

30:58.648 --> 31:00.566
I DID FINE.

31:00.733 --> 31:01.900
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
TAKE THE TEST.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.068
[LAUGHS]

31:03.236 --> 31:04.486
THAT MEANS I
COULDN'T HAVE
DONE BAD.

31:04.654 --> 31:05.696
YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.072
YOU GO CHANGE
YOUR CLOTHES, TOO.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.615
YES, PA.

31:14.664 --> 31:17.416
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
SO DOWN IN THE MOUTH
ABOUT?

31:17.584 --> 31:19.001
DID YOU DO BAD
ON THE TEST?

31:19.168 --> 31:21.086
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I DID.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.338
PRACTICALLY
DON'T EVEN CARE.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.424
WELL, WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

31:25.592 --> 31:28.010
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND PEOPLE, PA.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.678
ALBERT'S NOT DOING
HIS BEST IN SCHOOL

31:29.846 --> 31:31.346
BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID
HE WON'T BE POPULAR.

31:31.514 --> 31:32.306
WHOA, WHOA,
NOW, HOLD ON.

31:32.473 --> 31:34.099
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:34.267 --> 31:37.352
HE'S AFRAID THE KIDS
WON'T LIKE HIM
BECAUSE HE'S SO SMART.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.520
THAT'S NONSENSE.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.856
THAT'S WHAT I TRIED
TO TELL HIM.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.774
I'LL JUST HAVE
A LITTLE TALK
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.276
I WISH SOMEONE WOULD
HAVE A TALK WITH ANDY.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.861
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ANDY?

31:46.029 --> 31:48.238
HE'S WORKING HARD.
HIS GRADES HAVE
NEVER BEEN HIGHER.

31:49.532 --> 31:52.743
I KNOW.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.745
I PROMISED NOT
TO TELL HIS MA.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.039
YOU DIDN'T PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ME.

32:00.877 --> 32:03.045
WILL YOU TELL
HIS MA OR PA?

32:03.212 --> 32:05.756
IT ALL DEPENDS
WHAT IT IS.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.925
[SIGHS]

32:08.092 --> 32:10.385
IT WAS NELLIE WHO
GOT HIM INTO IT.

32:10.553 --> 32:14.222
HE ONLY WANTED TO DO
WHAT HIS MA WANTED.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.224
HE'S BEEN CHEATING.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.559
Laura:
NELLIE CHEATS, TOO,

32:17.727 --> 32:19.561
AND I KNOW HOW
SHE DOES IT.

32:19.729 --> 32:20.771
LET'S NOT WORRY
ABOUT NELLIE.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.230
IT'S ANDY I'M
WORRIED ABOUT.

32:22.398 --> 32:25.108
Laura: WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT, PA?

32:25.276 --> 32:27.277
I DON'T KNOW.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.737
FIRST, I'M GOING
TO HANG THOSE DOORS,

32:28.905 --> 32:30.822
AND THEN, I THINK
I'LL TAKE ANDY FISHING.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.536
Charles:
HEY, YOU GOT
ONE ON THERE.

32:36.704 --> 32:37.496
PULL IT IN.

32:37.664 --> 32:41.667
WHOO HOO, HEY,
ANOTHER NICE ONE.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.127
THERE YOU GO.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.922
YOU'RE GETTING
A FINE STRING
OF FISH THERE.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.675
MAKE A GOOD
SUPPER TONIGHT.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.927
[FROGS CROAKING]

32:52.095 --> 32:54.680
LISTEN TO THOSE
FROGS, HUH?

32:54.847 --> 32:56.139
PUTS ME TO MIND
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.976
NOTHING I LIKED
BETTER THAN GOING
NIGHT FROGGING.

32:59.143 --> 33:02.980
I USED TO SNEAK
OUT AT NIGHT SO
I COULD DO IT.

33:03.147 --> 33:06.608
I REMEMBER ONE TIME,
I STAYED OUT
THE WHOLE NIGHT.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.443
SNUCK BACK INTO
THE HOUSE. MY FOLKS
WERE STILL ASLEEP.

33:08.611 --> 33:09.778
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW I WAS GONE.

33:09.946 --> 33:10.946
I JUST CLIMBED
RIGHT INTO BED,

33:11.114 --> 33:13.031
AND THEY NEVER KNEW
A THING ABOUT IT.

33:14.701 --> 33:18.036
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY TIME
I CHEATED WHEN I WAS A KID.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.123
I GUESS ALL KIDS DO.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.291
I REMEMBER I USED TO
PLAY HOOKY FROM SCHOOL
ONCE IN A WHILE.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.085
Charles:
I LEARNED HOW TO COPY
MY MA'S HANDWRITING,

33:25.253 --> 33:28.255
SO, I'D WRITE THEM NOTES
ABOUT HOW I WAS SICK
AND EVERYTHING.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.550
THE THING IS,
I NEVER FELT
VERY GOOD ABOUT IT.

33:31.718 --> 33:34.469
GUILTY CONSCIENCE,
I GUESS.

33:34.637 --> 33:36.930
AND ONE DAY, I JUST
GOT MY COURAGE UP,

33:37.098 --> 33:39.391
WENT AND TOLD
MY MA AND PA.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.602
TELL YOU, MY PA
GAVE ME A WHIPPING
I WILL NEVER FORGET.

33:44.188 --> 33:48.191
YOU KNOW, I NEVER ENJOYED
ANYTHING AS MUCH AS THAT.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.943
CLEARED MY CONSCIENCE,
I GUESS.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.489
I THINK I'VE CAUGHT
ENOUGH, MR. INGALLS.

33:54.657 --> 33:55.824
I'D BEST BE GOING.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.243
Charles: WHATEVER YOU SAY.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.870
MR. INGALLS...

34:03.458 --> 34:04.875
THANKS.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.335
YOU'RE WELCOME, SON.

34:25.354 --> 34:28.648
Mrs. Garvey: I SAVED THE RESULTS
OF YESTERDAY'S EXAMINATION
TILL THE END OF THE DAY

34:28.816 --> 34:30.776
SO YOU WOULDN'T
BE DISTRACTED IN
YOUR PREPARATION

34:30.943 --> 34:35.447
FOR THE FINAL PART OF
THE EXAMINATION TOMORROW,

34:35.615 --> 34:39.367
WHICH WILL COVER
ARITHMETIC AND ENGLISH.

34:39.535 --> 34:40.952
I'M REALLY
VERY PLEASED.

34:41.120 --> 34:45.457
MOST OF YOU DID VERY
WELL INDEED AND ARE
TO BE CONGRATULATED.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.168
Mrs. Garvey: ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
ONE OR TWO LOW GRADES,

34:48.336 --> 34:51.254
I KNOW YOU ALL
DID YOUR BEST.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.340
TWO OF YOU TURNED
IN PERFECT PAPERS

34:53.508 --> 34:55.175
AND TIED FOR THE LEAD.

34:55.343 --> 34:57.636
WE MAY NEED ANOTHER BLUE
RIBBON IF YOU DO AS WELL

34:57.804 --> 34:59.221
IN THE SECOND PART
OF THE EXAMINATION.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.473
Mrs. Oleson: WELL, I'LL
BE VERY HAPPY TO DONATE

35:01.641 --> 35:03.767
ANOTHER BLUE RIBBON
FOR THE OTHER WINNER.

35:03.935 --> 35:04.810
THANK YOU,
MRS. OLESON.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.394
AH, YES.

35:06.562 --> 35:10.107
I DON'T WANT TO
DISCOURAGE OR REFLECT ON
THE REST OF THE CLASS,

35:10.274 --> 35:15.237
BUT I KNOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHY I'M SO PROUD OF
THE TWO LEADERS,

35:15.404 --> 35:18.698
NELLIE OLESON AND
ANDREW GARVEY.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.367
[APPLAUSE]

35:32.922 --> 35:35.132
CONGRATULATIONS
TO BOTH OF YOU.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.634
MA?

35:37.802 --> 35:39.427
MRS. GARVEY?

35:39.595 --> 35:41.138
YES, ANDY?

35:45.935 --> 35:48.770
I DON'T DESERVE
NO CONGRATULATIONS.

35:48.938 --> 35:51.857
I...

35:52.024 --> 35:53.108
I CHEATED.

35:54.193 --> 35:55.652
Andrew:
I CHEATED ON
YESTERDAY'S EXAM

35:55.820 --> 36:00.824
AND ALL THE DAYS BEFORE
WHEN I GOT GOOD GRADES.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.576
I'M SORRY.

36:28.686 --> 36:29.853
[CLEARS THROAT]

36:30.021 --> 36:31.479

36:36.819 --> 36:38.695
I'M PROUD OF
YOU, ANDY.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.996
TSK, TSK, TSK.

36:48.164 --> 36:50.582
WHAT A DISGRACE.

36:50.750 --> 36:55.837
Mrs. Oleson:
OH, ALICE, I'M TRULY
SORRY FOR YOU.

36:56.005 --> 37:02.552
I CAN JUST IMAGINE THE
SHAME YOU MUST BE FEELING.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.762
OH!

37:04.889 --> 37:08.725
Mrs. Oleson: WELL, COME
ALONG, NELLIE, DARLING.

37:08.893 --> 37:12.020
YOU GO HOME AND STUDY
FOR TOMORROW'S TEST.

37:12.188 --> 37:15.106
WE'LL LEAVE MRS. GARVEY
ALONE WITH HER SON

37:15.274 --> 37:18.193
AND HER UNHAPPY DISCOVERY.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.694
TSK, TSK, TSK.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.378
WHY, ANDY?

37:38.673 --> 37:40.298
I DON'T KNOW.

37:43.177 --> 37:45.929
YOU DON'T KNOW,
OR YOU JUST DON'T
WANT TO TELL ME?

37:50.518 --> 37:52.102
I KNOW WHY.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.697
ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL YOUR MA,
OR SHOULD I?

38:15.710 --> 38:18.962
HE WASN'T THE ONLY
ONE WHO CHEATED,
MRS. GARVEY.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.173
Laura:
NELLIE OLESON CHEATED, TOO.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.467
SHE SHOWED HIM HOW.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.886
SHE MADE HIM STEAL THE
QUESTIONS TO THE TEST,

38:27.054 --> 38:29.597
AND SHE SAID SHE'D TELL
ON HIM IF HE DIDN'T.

38:46.574 --> 38:50.327
YOUR MA AND I'VE
BEEN TALKING
THINGS OUT, SON.

38:50.494 --> 38:55.290
WELL, WE'RE BOTH GLAD
YOU FINALLY SPOKE UP
LIKE YOU DID.

38:55.458 --> 39:00.253
TOOK A LOT OF
COURAGE TO DO
WHAT YOU DID.

39:00.421 --> 39:04.466
BUT IT DON'T
WIPE OUT WHAT
HAPPENED BEFORE.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.303
ARE YOU GOING
TO PUNISH ME?

39:09.722 --> 39:12.807
I'M GOING TO HOLD
OFF ANSWERING THAT.

39:12.975 --> 39:14.476
THE WAY I GOT
IT FIGURED,

39:14.643 --> 39:18.438
YOUR MA AND I
KIND OF HAD A PART
IN WHAT HAPPENED.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.898
EXPECTING TOO
MUCH OF YOU,

39:20.066 --> 39:23.151
BEING A
TEACHER'S SON.

39:23.319 --> 39:26.196
Mrs. Garvey:
AND PUTTING YOU IN
WITH NELLIE OLESON.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.367
WE'VE LEARNED
A LESSON FROM IT.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.119
HAS IT TAUGHT YOU
ANYTHING, SON?

39:33.287 --> 39:35.205
YES, SIR, I HAVE.

39:35.373 --> 39:39.042
I'LL NEVER CHEAT
AGAIN, EVER.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.420
FROM NOW ON, WHEN
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,

39:42.588 --> 39:45.215
WE WANT YOU TO COME
AND TALK TO US ABOUT IT.

39:46.675 --> 39:48.593
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF ME NOW?

39:53.849 --> 39:55.934
WHAT DO YOU FIGURE
WE THINK OF YOU NOW?

39:56.102 --> 39:59.437
I DON'T KNOW.

39:59.605 --> 40:00.688
WE LOVE YOU, BOY.

40:02.024 --> 40:05.527
Jonathan:
AIN'T NOTHING EVER
GOING TO CHANGE THAT.

40:05.694 --> 40:10.198
WE DIDN'T FIGURE YOU'D
GROW UP WITHOUT MAKING
A FEW MISTAKES.

40:10.366 --> 40:14.285
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES...

40:14.453 --> 40:18.164
BUT LYING AND CHEATING,
WE CAN'T ABIDE.

40:18.332 --> 40:20.375
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, SON?

40:22.169 --> 40:23.503
YES, SIR.

40:29.635 --> 40:33.888
I THINK MAYBE YOU AND
I BETTER MAKE A TRIP
OUT TO THE BARN.

40:37.726 --> 40:39.018
Mrs. Garvey: DO YOU HAVE TO?

40:39.186 --> 40:40.895
IT'S OKAY, MA.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.689
IT'LL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

41:11.594 --> 41:15.180
MMM, SMELL
THAT NIGHT AIR.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.098
REALLY SOMETHING,
ISN'T IT?

41:17.266 --> 41:20.852
YES, SIR.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.730
DID I DO
SOMETHING WRONG?

41:23.898 --> 41:26.149
WHAT MAKES
YOU ASK THAT?

41:26.317 --> 41:28.776
I DON'T KNOW.

41:28.944 --> 41:31.571
FIRST, YOU SAY,
"LET'S TAKE A WALK
TO THE BARN,"

41:31.739 --> 41:34.782
SO, I FIGURE YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME ALONE.

41:34.950 --> 41:38.578
THEN, YOU JUST
TALK ABOUT HOW
THE AIR SMELLS.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.539
I FIGURE I MUST
HAVE DONE SOMETHING.

41:41.707 --> 41:43.875
THAT'S GOOD FIGURING.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.794
COURSE, YOU'RE ALWAYS
GOOD AT FIGURING...

41:46.962 --> 41:48.546
UP UNTIL LATELY,
THAT IS.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.093
OH, YEAH, MY GRADES.

41:54.261 --> 41:55.678
YEAH, YOUR GRADES.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.642
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT ANDY CHEATING
TO GET HIGHER GRADES?

42:00.809 --> 42:02.227
THINK THAT'S RIGHT?

42:04.313 --> 42:06.648
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT,

42:06.815 --> 42:08.525
BUT LEASTWISE, HE TOLD.

42:08.692 --> 42:11.236
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

42:11.403 --> 42:12.654
DO YOU THINK IT'S
POSSIBLE FOR A FELLOW

42:12.821 --> 42:17.909
TO DELIBERATELY
GET LOWER GRADES

42:18.077 --> 42:19.702
JUST TO BE ONE
OF THE BOYS?

42:23.582 --> 42:25.291
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.003
HOW ABOUT PROBABLE?

42:29.171 --> 42:30.964
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN DOING, ISN'T IT?

42:36.470 --> 42:37.804
ISN'T IT?

42:39.890 --> 42:41.057
YES, SIR.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.225
Charles:
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
YOU'VE BEEN CHEATING.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.685
I NEVER CHEAT--

42:43.852 --> 42:46.563
Charles: HOLD ON,
THERE'S A LOT OF
WAYS OF CHEATING.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.482
SOME OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD
AND MAYBE WORSE.

42:52.152 --> 42:53.570
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.780
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
THE ONLY THING I'VE
EVER ASKED OF A CHILD

42:55.948 --> 42:57.907
IS THAT HE DO HIS BEST,

42:58.075 --> 43:01.661
JUST WORK THE HARDEST HE CAN
AT ANY JOB THAT HE HAS.

43:01.829 --> 43:04.455
THAT'S ALL A PARENT
EVER ASKS OF A CHILD.

43:04.623 --> 43:07.208
WHEN YOU DON'T USE
THE ABILITY AND THE
BRAINS THAT GOD GAVE YOU,

43:07.376 --> 43:08.668
YOU'RE CHEATING.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.129
YOU'RE CHEATING GOD, AND
YOU'RE CHEATING YOURSELF.

43:16.176 --> 43:18.928
SORRY, PA.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.514
GUESS I NEVER REALLY
THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.934
YOU'D BETTER START
THINKING ABOUT IT
THAT WAY.

43:25.102 --> 43:26.227
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.520
THERE'S A LOT OF
THINGS IN THIS WORLD

43:27.688 --> 43:29.689
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN BEING POPULAR.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.858
BEING TRUE TO YOURSELF
IS ONE OF THEM.

43:34.194 --> 43:35.528
YES, SIR.

43:38.407 --> 43:41.576
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU GOT
A TEST COMING UP, DON'T YOU?

43:41.744 --> 43:44.662
MM-HMM.
YES, SIR.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.456
WELL, WHILE I'M OUT HERE
