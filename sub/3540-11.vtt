00:02.134 --> 00:03.828
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.003 --> 00:06.596
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.805 --> 00:08.670
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:08.841 --> 00:10.604
Elena. A dead ringer for Katherine.

00:10.776 --> 00:12.937
That necklace contains an herb
called vervain.

00:13.145 --> 00:15.113
It protects you from being compelled.

00:15.280 --> 00:18.340
- Our love for Katherine wasn't real.
- I'm gonna bring her back.

00:18.517 --> 00:22.544
There's a tomb underneath the church.
The spell sealed Katherine in that tomb.

00:22.721 --> 00:24.154
- Hello, Jenna.
- Logan.

00:24.323 --> 00:25.585
- Who are you?
- Friend of Jenna's.

00:28.193 --> 00:30.957
Alaric Saltzman.
I'm your new history teacher.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.825
Grams just showed me this. I'm a witch.

00:35.601 --> 00:37.535
- His face was like...
- Are you okay?

00:37.736 --> 00:40.034
- What's going on?
- I'm gonna tell her the truth.

00:40.239 --> 00:44.300
I know you think you brought this bad stuff
into my life, but my life already had it.

00:44.510 --> 00:47.138
- This is different.
- I know what I want.

00:47.312 --> 00:49.041
I've never been in your room before.

00:49.248 --> 00:51.910
This room holds every memory
important enough to hold onto.

00:53.285 --> 00:54.718
Elena?

00:58.323 --> 01:01.190
Elena, it's Stefan.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.352
I know that this picture
must've confused you.

01:04.530 --> 01:06.498
But I can explain.

01:06.698 --> 01:07.722
I need to explain.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.427
So please, when you get this, call me.

02:07.793 --> 02:09.192
How you doing in there?

02:09.360 --> 02:11.386
- Damon.
- You look stuck.

02:12.297 --> 02:15.198
- It's my seat belt. I can't get it off.
- Shh, shh, shh.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.699
Let me get you out of here.
I want you to put your hands on the roof.

02:19.438 --> 02:21.303
Just like that. You ready?

02:21.773 --> 02:25.937
One, two, three.

02:26.979 --> 02:28.207
Gotcha.

02:29.848 --> 02:32.612
You okay? Can you stand?

02:32.818 --> 02:34.410
Is anything broken?

02:40.626 --> 02:43.151
Whoa, you're fading fast, Elena.

02:43.795 --> 02:45.763
Elena, look at me.

02:45.964 --> 02:48.831
Focus. Look at me.

02:49.768 --> 02:51.326
Okay.

02:51.870 --> 02:54.964
- I look like her.
- What?

03:06.251 --> 03:08.242
Upsy-daisy.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.827
I found one.

03:23.001 --> 03:28.303
After years of research and study,
there it was, right in front of me.

03:28.907 --> 03:30.397
I was terrified.

03:31.076 --> 03:35.172
As I stared it in the eyes,
I drove a stake through its heart.

03:36.014 --> 03:38.448
I was right about Mystic Falls.

03:38.617 --> 03:39.709
There is evil here.

03:40.385 --> 03:43.047
I can sense it, feel it.

03:43.589 --> 03:44.851
It's everywhere.

03:57.369 --> 03:58.734
Oh...

04:00.405 --> 04:01.872
It's not even 7 yet.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.305
Which means you shouldn't be awake
for at least six hours.

04:05.510 --> 04:08.001
I hate morning people.

04:09.448 --> 04:11.177
I'm gonna be home late.

04:11.383 --> 04:13.681
- I love you.
- I love you too.

04:46.451 --> 04:48.043
Morning.

04:50.355 --> 04:54.155
- Where are we?
- In Georgia.

04:54.359 --> 04:55.951
Georgia?

04:56.128 --> 04:57.561
No, no, no, we're not.

04:57.729 --> 05:01.426
- Seriously, Damon, where are we?
- Seriously, we're in Georgia.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.568
- Ugh.
- How you feeling?

05:03.735 --> 05:05.100
L...

05:05.304 --> 05:08.102
There's no broken bones. I checked.

05:08.307 --> 05:11.902
My car. There was a man...

05:12.077 --> 05:13.374
I hit a man.

05:13.578 --> 05:15.671
But then he got up and...
Who was that?

05:15.914 --> 05:18.144
That's what I would like to know.

05:18.617 --> 05:19.879
Where's my phone?

05:20.319 --> 05:23.015
Okay, we really need to go back.
Nobody knows where I am.

05:23.255 --> 05:24.916
Pull over.

05:25.257 --> 05:26.986
I mean it, Damon. Pull over.

05:27.926 --> 05:29.154
Stop the car.

05:29.394 --> 05:31.919
Oh, you were so much more fun
when you were asleep.

05:41.673 --> 05:43.265
Hey.

05:43.775 --> 05:45.709
I'm fine.

05:47.279 --> 05:48.405
We have to go back.

05:48.613 --> 05:50.911
Oh, come on.
Look, we've already come this far.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.983
Why are you doing this?

05:53.185 --> 05:54.345
I can't be in Georgia.

05:54.519 --> 05:57.317
I wrecked my car. I have to go home.

05:57.522 --> 05:59.114
This is kidnapping.

05:59.324 --> 06:01.792
That's a little melodramatic,
don't you think?

06:01.993 --> 06:03.620
You're not funny.

06:03.795 --> 06:04.819
You can't do this.

06:04.996 --> 06:07.328
- I'm not going to Georgia.
- You're in Georgia.

06:07.933 --> 06:10.629
Without your magic little necklace,
I might add.

06:10.802 --> 06:15.239
I could very easily
make you agreeable.

06:15.474 --> 06:16.873
What are you trying to prove?

06:21.246 --> 06:22.543
That's my phone.

06:26.184 --> 06:27.947
It's your boyfriend.

06:28.153 --> 06:30.553
I'll take it. Elena's phone.

06:30.756 --> 06:32.656
Where is she?
Why do you have her phone?

06:32.824 --> 06:34.348
- Is she okay?
- Elena?

06:34.559 --> 06:35.821
No, she's right here.

06:36.027 --> 06:39.963
- And, yes, she's fine.
- Where are you? Let me speak to her.

06:40.999 --> 06:43.092
He wants to talk to you.

06:43.635 --> 06:44.897
Mm-mm.

06:46.071 --> 06:50.235
Yeah, l... You know, I don't think she
really wants to talk to you right now.

06:50.475 --> 06:52.705
Damon, I swear to God,
if you touch her...

06:52.911 --> 06:55.573
You have a good day. Mm-hm. Bye, now.

06:58.383 --> 07:00.078
Bastard.

07:10.128 --> 07:13.359
Look, no one knows where I am.
Can we please just go back?

07:13.565 --> 07:14.623
We're almost there.

07:14.866 --> 07:17.300
- Where is "there"?
- A place outside of Atlanta.

07:17.502 --> 07:21.029
Oh, come on, Elena, you don't
wanna go back right now, do you?

07:21.773 --> 07:23.240
What's the rush?

07:23.442 --> 07:24.534
Time out.

07:24.709 --> 07:28.270
Trust me, your problems are still
gonna be there when you get home.

07:29.247 --> 07:32.307
Look, step away from your life
for five minutes.

07:32.517 --> 07:34.451
Five minutes.

07:39.424 --> 07:42.018
- Am I gonna be safe with you?
- Yes.

07:42.227 --> 07:46.391
Will you promise not to do
that mind-control thing with me?

07:46.598 --> 07:47.792
Yes.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.924
Can I trust you?

07:51.036 --> 07:53.561
Get in the car. Come on.

08:01.112 --> 08:02.272
Hey, hey, Mr. Saltzman.

08:02.848 --> 08:05.282
Hey, Jeremy. I, uh, can't find my ring. L...

08:05.450 --> 08:08.817
I took it off for the gym
and I thought I put it...

08:09.454 --> 08:11.445
There it is. Phew.

08:13.124 --> 08:16.423
Losing family heirlooms, bad.

08:17.295 --> 08:21.197
- How's your extra credit? Pick a topic?
- Uh, Mystic Falls, the Civil War era.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.128
- What's the angle?
- My family.

08:23.301 --> 08:26.134
I found a journal of an ancestor
who lived in the 1800s.

08:26.304 --> 08:30.604
And the Gilberts were one of the original
founding families of Mystic Falls, so...

08:31.176 --> 08:33.006
That sounds good.

08:33.178 --> 08:34.702
- Bonnie.
- Stefan.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.780
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.677
I, uh, haven't seen you lately.

08:38.850 --> 08:41.511
How are you doing with everything?

08:41.686 --> 08:43.677
I'm fine. All's fine.

08:43.855 --> 08:45.516
- Good.
- Yeah.

08:46.491 --> 08:51.019
- Are you back in school?
- No, actually I came here to find you.

08:51.196 --> 08:53.756
I was hoping you could help me
with something. A spell.

08:55.967 --> 08:59.630
Stefan, look,
I know Elena is okay with all of this...

08:59.804 --> 09:03.797
...and I appreciate what you did to help me,
but I'm not ready to dive into it yet.

09:03.975 --> 09:06.341
I understand that,
but I need your help.

09:07.345 --> 09:10.337
It's Elena. She's with Damon.

09:12.617 --> 09:13.743
I have Elena's necklace.

09:13.919 --> 09:16.513
I was hoping you can use this
to make some connection.

09:16.688 --> 09:19.714
- I need to know she's okay.
- How do you know I can do this?

09:19.891 --> 09:22.917
I've known a few witches.
I've seen what they can do.

09:23.128 --> 09:25.892
- I'm still new at it.
- It's okay.

09:26.431 --> 09:27.864
Give it a shot.

09:28.066 --> 09:29.658
Okay.

09:30.201 --> 09:31.759
All right.

09:43.214 --> 09:44.511
There's nothing.

09:44.716 --> 09:47.776
Nothing's happening.
Usually, there's an image or...

09:49.254 --> 09:51.745
- Tell me if anyone's looking.
- Okay.

10:13.578 --> 10:15.569
- What is it?
- Something's wrong.

10:15.747 --> 10:17.112
- With Elena?
- With me.

10:17.282 --> 10:18.943
There's something wrong with me.

10:19.484 --> 10:20.542
I have to go.

10:20.752 --> 10:23.312
I'm sorry, Stefan. I can't help you.

10:29.260 --> 10:32.229
- So where's my car?
- Uh, I pulled it off to the side of the road.

10:32.397 --> 10:34.331
I don't think anyone will bother it.

10:34.499 --> 10:36.990
What about that man in the road?

10:38.403 --> 10:41.236
- Was he a?
- From what I could tell, yeah.

10:41.406 --> 10:42.771
You didn't know him?

10:42.941 --> 10:45.501
If I've never met him,
I wouldn't know him.

10:45.910 --> 10:49.641
I mean, it's not like we all hang out
together at the Vamp Bar and Grill.

10:55.086 --> 10:58.487
Where are we
You brought me to a bar?

10:59.290 --> 11:01.815
I'm not old enough.
They're not gonna let me in.

11:02.027 --> 11:03.585
Sure they will.

11:13.238 --> 11:15.729
No. No, it can't be.

11:16.307 --> 11:17.831
Damon?

11:18.009 --> 11:19.033
Aw...

11:23.515 --> 11:24.982
My honey pie.

11:26.051 --> 11:27.382
- Mm.
- Mm.

11:35.927 --> 11:37.554
Listen up, everybody.

11:37.762 --> 11:43.632
Here's to the man that broke my heart,
crushed my soul, destroyed my life...

11:43.802 --> 11:47.203
...and ruined any and all chances
of happiness.

11:48.373 --> 11:50.102
Drink up.

11:53.778 --> 11:54.802
Whoo.

11:56.114 --> 11:58.582
So how'd he rope you in?

11:58.750 --> 12:00.809
I'm not roped in.
Actually, I'm dating his...

12:00.985 --> 12:03.613
Oh, honey, if you're not roped,
you're whipped.

12:03.788 --> 12:06.985
- Either way, just enjoy the ride.
- Okay.

12:07.158 --> 12:10.650
- So how did you two meet?
- Ha, ha. College.

12:11.162 --> 12:12.789
You went to college?

12:12.997 --> 12:15.124
I've been on a college campus, yes.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.167
About 20 years ago,
when I was a sweet young freshman...

12:18.336 --> 12:21.703
...I met this beautiful man
and I fell in love.

12:21.873 --> 12:24.171
And then he told me
about his little secret...

12:24.342 --> 12:25.741
...made me love him even more.

12:25.910 --> 12:29.903
I had a little secret of my own that
I was dying to share with somebody.

12:30.482 --> 12:31.642
She's a witch.

12:32.851 --> 12:35.877
- You changed my world, you know.
- I rocked your world.

12:36.121 --> 12:38.112
He is good in the sack, isn't he?

12:38.757 --> 12:40.349
But mostly he's just, uh...

12:40.558 --> 12:42.856
...a walk-away Joe.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.254
So...

12:48.566 --> 12:50.898
What is it that you want?

13:22.667 --> 13:24.692
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

13:24.903 --> 13:28.168
There was this one book wedged

13:28.339 --> 13:29.806
Kaplunk, kaboom.

13:30.575 --> 13:32.167
Are you okay?

13:32.343 --> 13:33.901
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

13:34.112 --> 13:35.704
Okay.

13:37.749 --> 13:40.149
Ow. Oh...

13:42.053 --> 13:45.318
- Um, I'm Anna.
- Uh, Jeremy.

13:59.904 --> 14:02.395
Oh, thank God, you're back.

14:03.074 --> 14:04.200
And hello to you too.

14:05.743 --> 14:08.337
- What's the matter?
- My powers are gone, Grams.

14:08.513 --> 14:11.414
I can't do anything,
even when I concentrate.

14:11.583 --> 14:15.019
There's nothing in any of these books
that tell me how to get them back.

14:15.253 --> 14:18.154
Hang on, now. Just calm down.

14:18.323 --> 14:19.415
Tell me what happened.

14:20.592 --> 14:23.993
- I can't.
- We're keeping secrets now?

14:24.162 --> 14:26.824
I have to. I'm sorry, I promised.

14:28.366 --> 14:31.267
Please, help me.

14:33.605 --> 14:37.234
Well, first of all, there's nothing
in any of these that's gonna help you.

14:37.408 --> 14:39.433
If you're blocked, it's in here.

14:39.644 --> 14:43.011
You gotta clear it out,
then you're back in business.

14:43.248 --> 14:44.875
Clear what out?

14:45.116 --> 14:47.607
Whatever's got you so scared.

14:50.488 --> 14:53.514
Hi, Jenna, I'm so sorry.

14:53.691 --> 14:56.125
Where are you Why didn't you call?

14:56.294 --> 14:58.785
I was so tired last night.
I fell asleep at Bonnie's.

14:58.963 --> 15:01.989
And then this morning
I just wanted to get to school.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.457
Are you okay?

15:04.669 --> 15:07.763
You know, Stefan and stuff.

15:11.042 --> 15:13.772
Come on,
there's gotta be another way.

15:13.945 --> 15:16.379
After all these years,
it's still only Katherine.

15:16.547 --> 15:17.980
How do you know she's alive?

15:18.182 --> 15:22.642
Well, you help me get into that tomb
and we'll find out.

15:22.820 --> 15:26.551
I already did, 20 years ago,
remember?

15:26.791 --> 15:29.487
Comet, crystal, spell.

15:29.661 --> 15:31.595
There's a little problem
with number two.

15:31.796 --> 15:33.525
I don't have the crystal.

15:34.332 --> 15:35.356
That's it, Damon.

15:35.533 --> 15:37.660
There is no other way.
It's Emily's spell.

15:38.236 --> 15:43.503
What about new spell with a new crystal
that overrides Emily's spell?

15:44.008 --> 15:45.873
It doesn't work that way, baby.

15:46.044 --> 15:49.741
Emily's spell is absolute.
You can't get into that tomb.

16:34.559 --> 16:36.754
Come on.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.005
Hello?

16:56.581 --> 16:58.879
Anybody here?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.964
Elena, is that you?

17:15.165 --> 17:16.258
I'm here.

17:16.434 --> 17:18.128
Where are you?

17:18.301 --> 17:19.462
You lied.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.262
Not until I explain, please.

17:21.472 --> 17:23.030
So you didn't lie?

17:23.273 --> 17:25.401
Tell me where you are
so I can come get you.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.477
How am I connected
to Katherine, Stefan?

17:28.679 --> 17:30.544
I honestly don't know.

17:30.782 --> 17:32.841
Heh. And I'm supposed to believe that?

17:33.017 --> 17:34.416
It's the truth, I...

17:35.653 --> 17:36.711
Listen.

17:39.524 --> 17:40.650
You okay?

17:40.858 --> 17:42.826
Don't pretend to care.

17:44.328 --> 17:46.728
I know you're gloating inside.

17:53.738 --> 17:55.865
Hey, it's Bree.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.838
You'll never guess
who walked into my bar.

18:14.559 --> 18:15.787
Ow.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.642
Hello?

18:33.845 --> 18:35.073
Anybody?

18:57.568 --> 18:59.798
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

19:00.004 --> 19:02.973
I'm Stefan, I'm a friend of Bonnie's.

19:05.610 --> 19:07.908
Her dad told me
that she might be here.

19:08.079 --> 19:10.274
She was. Not anymore.

19:10.448 --> 19:13.246
- Do you know where she went?
- No, but you do.

19:14.018 --> 19:15.417
I'm sorry?

19:15.586 --> 19:17.178
I told her to face down her fear.

19:17.388 --> 19:21.791
And I'm sensing now that you know
exactly why she was scared.

19:22.460 --> 19:26.521
You know what I am,
and yet you offered me your hand.

19:26.764 --> 19:30.131
Which means you wanted me
to see that I can trust you.

19:30.935 --> 19:32.527
Can you?

19:33.638 --> 19:35.833
I trust you'll keep her safe.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.632
Better be on your way, then.

19:37.808 --> 19:39.776
I'm not gonna invite you in.

19:39.944 --> 19:42.708
Sure you understand why.

19:46.817 --> 19:49.183
This aisle is local and state history.

19:49.353 --> 19:52.015
And Civil War is one over.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.351
- What do you need?
- Local, 1860s.

19:54.525 --> 19:56.186
- Do you work here?
- Nope.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.557
Uh, you want reference. This way.

19:59.730 --> 20:03.131
Um, home-schooled. I study here
for a mock-school environment.

20:03.301 --> 20:04.791
Ah, here we go.

20:04.969 --> 20:09.030
Original settlers, town archives,
founders' stuff. It's all here.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.504
So, what's your topic?

20:11.475 --> 20:16.378
Uh, the town's fear surrounding the war
and how it influenced certain writers.

20:16.547 --> 20:18.071
You might wanna focus that.

20:18.549 --> 20:21.074
The origins of local folklore and myths.

20:21.252 --> 20:23.311
You mean the vampires.

20:25.523 --> 20:28.321
Let's just say
that I'm descended from Katherine.

20:28.492 --> 20:31.052
Does that make me part-vampire?

20:31.262 --> 20:33.696
Vampires can't procreate.

20:34.198 --> 20:35.893
But we love to try.

20:37.268 --> 20:38.701
No. If you were related...

20:39.270 --> 20:42.501
...it would mean that Katherine
had a child before she was turned.

20:42.673 --> 20:46.234
Did Stefan think
that he could use me to replace her?

20:46.477 --> 20:48.001
Kind of creepy if you ask me.

20:49.113 --> 20:51.980
Come on, you don't like pickles?
What's wrong with you?

20:52.183 --> 20:55.778
How can you even eat,
if technically you're supposed to be?

20:56.854 --> 21:00.051
Dead? It's not such a bad word.

21:00.258 --> 21:04.786
As long as I keep a healthy diet
of blood in my system...

21:04.996 --> 21:07.556
...my body functions pretty normally.

21:10.001 --> 21:13.437
This nice act, is any of it real?

21:14.672 --> 21:15.696
Mm-hm.

21:16.274 --> 21:18.708
- Here you go, honey.
- Thank you.

21:20.278 --> 21:21.506
I'll have one too.

21:21.879 --> 21:22.937
Hmm?

21:23.114 --> 21:26.140
Time out, remember? For five minutes.

21:26.384 --> 21:29.444
Yeah, well,
that five minutes is gonna need a beer.

21:30.521 --> 21:32.386
There you go.

21:38.095 --> 21:41.121
You're kidding me, right?
There's no such thing as vampires.

21:41.299 --> 21:43.893
Well, there's not
a lot of documentation...

21:44.068 --> 21:46.628
...but stories have been told
since the Civil War.

21:46.804 --> 21:49.272
My granddad
used to tell me these creepy stories.

21:49.473 --> 21:52.306
And he said
that his granddad told them to him.

21:52.510 --> 21:56.071
That would be folklore. Vampires are
a metaphor for the demons of the day.

21:56.747 --> 21:58.942
- Which are?
- The Union soldiers.

21:59.116 --> 22:01.448
I've read the stories.
They talk about the enemy.

22:01.619 --> 22:03.416
The demons that attack at night.

22:04.155 --> 22:05.679
That sounds like vampires to me.

22:05.923 --> 22:08.858
Allegorical vampires,
which is what it is.

22:09.060 --> 22:11.426
Creative expression
during a very volatile time.

22:11.862 --> 22:15.093
I mean, a country at war
doesn't want realism, they want fantasy.

22:15.266 --> 22:16.756
Thus, vampire fiction.

22:18.302 --> 22:20.634
Man, you're smart.

22:21.205 --> 22:24.504
I gotta give it to you,
when I first saw you, I missed it. Heh.

22:25.142 --> 22:26.507
Yeah, I've, uh...

22:26.677 --> 22:30.943
I've had a rough go of it lately, but
I'm just now getting back to my old self.

22:31.415 --> 22:32.439
Heh.

22:33.384 --> 22:37.115
Well, good luck on your paper.
I gotta get home.

22:37.888 --> 22:41.449
My great-grandfather actually showed
me a journal once of an ancestor.

22:41.659 --> 22:44.492
And he had written
all of this creepy stuff about vampires.

22:44.662 --> 22:46.527
It was actually really believable.

22:46.731 --> 22:48.722
- Wait, a journal?
- Yeah.

22:48.899 --> 22:50.025
Why?

22:51.469 --> 22:53.300
Are you sure you have to go?

22:56.707 --> 22:58.470
Come on.

22:59.710 --> 23:01.735
Come on, phone.

23:03.714 --> 23:05.238
Great.

23:40.518 --> 23:43.248
- Get away from me.
- Bonnie. Bonnie, it's me. It's Stefan.

23:43.487 --> 23:45.182
Stefan?

23:45.389 --> 23:47.220
Okay, the ground gave way and I fell.

23:47.391 --> 23:49.655
It's okay, it's okay. Calm down.

23:50.194 --> 23:52.526
- Come on, let's get you out of here.
- How?

23:54.198 --> 23:56.223
Just close your eyes.

23:56.667 --> 23:57.998
Trust me.

24:00.070 --> 24:01.560
Come here.

24:13.684 --> 24:14.776
You can open your eyes now.

24:15.753 --> 24:17.084
Whoa.

24:17.254 --> 24:20.018
- I didn't wanna scare you.
- How did you know where I was?

24:20.191 --> 24:23.718
Your grandmother told me what you
were doing and I guessed the where.

24:26.363 --> 24:30.094
I heard them down there.

24:30.301 --> 24:32.098
Behind the door.

24:33.037 --> 24:36.063
- Are they in pain?
- In the beginning, yes, but not anymore.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.708
They've starved
to the point of desiccation.

24:39.210 --> 24:43.078
- But if they have blood they'll...
- That's not gonna happen, Bonnie.

24:43.247 --> 24:47.240
They can't get out. Emily saw to that
when she had you destroy the crystal.

24:48.452 --> 24:50.215
You're safe.

24:51.589 --> 24:53.784
- Ready? Go.
- Uh, uh-huh.

24:56.927 --> 24:58.758
That's three.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.154
You need a bib?

25:01.332 --> 25:05.325
Sorry, I can't unhinge my jaw
like a snake to consume alcohol.

25:05.536 --> 25:08.300
Whatever. All right, who's next?

25:08.472 --> 25:09.803
Another round, Bree?

25:09.974 --> 25:12.738
Honey, you should be on the floor.

25:12.943 --> 25:18.472
I am not even drunk.
My tolerance is, like, way up here.

25:20.484 --> 25:22.850
All right, here you go.

25:31.595 --> 25:33.495
So you have no idea where the journal is?

25:33.664 --> 25:37.896
Nope. Gramps died
and all the kids split his stuff. I can ask.

25:38.102 --> 25:42.562
I just find it weird our ancestors kept
the same kind of journals. It's crazy.

25:42.773 --> 25:46.470
- Maybe it's based in some partial reality.
- No, it's gotta be metaphorical.

25:46.644 --> 25:48.874
My ancestor wrote short stories.

25:49.113 --> 25:51.513
So that's why you're hung up
on the fiction of it.

25:51.715 --> 25:53.615
No, I'm hung up on fiction of it all...

25:53.784 --> 25:57.185
...because I've seen The Lost Boys
and Near Dark, like, 50 times.

25:57.388 --> 25:59.117
Are those movies? Heh.

25:59.957 --> 26:02.585
Hey, I've never seen them.

26:03.127 --> 26:07.154
Maybe we can have a fright night and
rent a whole bunch of vampire movies.

26:08.465 --> 26:09.625
Uh...

26:09.800 --> 26:11.290
Yeah, yeah, sure.

26:12.136 --> 26:15.230
Why does that sound like
a, "No way in hell"?

26:16.473 --> 26:20.239
- Sorry, I'm blunt.
- No, no, it's, uh...

26:20.411 --> 26:22.242
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

26:22.479 --> 26:24.606
I just recently got out of something.

26:25.115 --> 26:26.912
It's a little too soon, you know.

26:27.151 --> 26:28.550
No, please. Sure.

26:28.719 --> 26:31.745
Yeah, no worries. I meant as friends.

26:31.989 --> 26:33.320
So, yeah.

26:34.391 --> 26:37.485
Look, I really gotta go, so...

26:39.496 --> 26:41.623
Nice meeting you, Jeremy.

26:50.007 --> 26:51.269
Yeah!

26:57.214 --> 26:58.511
- Hello?
- Elena.

26:58.682 --> 27:02.641
- Jenna. Uh, hold on, it's loud in here.
- Elena, where are you?

27:02.820 --> 27:05.448
- Are you okay?
- Hmm? Yeah.

27:05.689 --> 27:07.054
I'm good. Everything's fine.

27:07.257 --> 27:10.283
- Hold on, I can't hear you.
- It's not fine. I got a call from...

27:15.299 --> 27:16.357
Hello?

27:23.540 --> 27:25.235
Thank you.

27:26.844 --> 27:29.472
Hey, where's your girl?

27:30.581 --> 27:31.605
Hmm.

27:31.815 --> 27:33.806
She was right back there.

28:04.314 --> 28:05.941
Damon, no.

28:12.256 --> 28:14.850
Ow! What the hell?

28:17.795 --> 28:18.887
No.

28:27.404 --> 28:30.532
- Who are you?
- That's perfect.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.198
You have no idea.

28:32.409 --> 28:36.709
- What're you talking about? What did he do?
- He killed my girlfriend.

28:41.118 --> 28:43.814
What did she do to you, huh?
What did she do to you?

28:44.755 --> 28:45.813
Nothing.

28:46.356 --> 28:48.187
I don't understand.

28:48.392 --> 28:52.954
My girlfriend went to visit Stefan,
and Damon killed her. Got it?

28:58.135 --> 29:01.400
Lexi? Lexi was your girlfriend?

29:01.572 --> 29:04.871
She told me about you.
She said that you were human.

29:06.276 --> 29:07.834
I was.

29:15.853 --> 29:16.877
Lexi turned you?

29:17.421 --> 29:21.858
If you wanna be with someone forever,
you have to live forever.

29:28.999 --> 29:30.296
She loved you.

29:30.501 --> 29:34.494
She said that when it's real,
you can't walk away.

29:34.738 --> 29:37.901
Well, that's a choice
you're not gonna have to make.

29:38.742 --> 29:41.404
Don't. Don't. Please, don't hurt him.

29:45.883 --> 29:47.475
I'm doing you a favor.

29:48.285 --> 29:52.779
Lexi loved you and she was good,
and that means you're good too.

29:53.824 --> 29:55.792
Be better than him.

29:56.260 --> 29:59.195
Don't do this, I'm begging you.

29:59.897 --> 30:01.592
Please.

30:22.953 --> 30:24.045
Thank you.

30:27.424 --> 30:29.517
It wasn't for you.

30:42.306 --> 30:45.298
Well, now,
look who's returned from battle.

30:50.147 --> 30:52.843
Can I talk to your friend for a minute?

30:57.254 --> 30:58.983
Thank you.

31:01.158 --> 31:03.388
I appreciate your help, Stefan.

31:04.228 --> 31:06.560
You're welcome, Sheila.

31:08.332 --> 31:10.197
I wasn't sure you remembered.

31:10.667 --> 31:14.159
- October 1969.
- I was barely a teenager.

31:14.338 --> 31:17.865
And you were leading what was probably
the only anti-war sit-in...

31:18.075 --> 31:20.202
...within miles of Mystic Falls.

31:20.410 --> 31:21.536
Humph.

31:21.712 --> 31:24.374
You know, when you spoke,
people were mesmerized.

31:26.016 --> 31:27.108
I know I was.

31:27.351 --> 31:29.979
Until the cops showed up.

31:31.355 --> 31:34.188
You took a big risk
coming to see me earlier.

31:34.358 --> 31:36.849
Letting me read you,
realize who you were.

31:37.527 --> 31:39.927
Could've gone
in a completely different way.

31:40.130 --> 31:45.568
Well, your family has a very long history
of keeping my secret.

31:45.769 --> 31:50.138
I knew that I could trust you if you
believed that I was worthy of your trust.

31:50.374 --> 31:52.774
Bonnie knows, doesn't she?

31:54.578 --> 31:55.602
Yes.

31:55.779 --> 32:00.148
Well, please understand
that our loyalty can only extend so far.

32:00.384 --> 32:04.377
This town won't be easy on any of us
if they figure it out.

32:04.588 --> 32:07.284
And I'll protect my own
before anybody else.

32:07.524 --> 32:09.617
I know that.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.458
As long as we're clear.

32:14.564 --> 32:16.293
Good night, then.

32:16.733 --> 32:18.325
Good night, Sheila.

32:30.580 --> 32:33.572
We were just leaving.
I wanted to say goodbye.

32:35.352 --> 32:37.684
Good to see you again, Damon.

32:38.322 --> 32:40.187
No kiss?

32:40.557 --> 32:42.855
I'm full of vervain.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.925
I put it in everything I drink.

32:45.128 --> 32:46.857
And you're telling me this. Why?

32:47.097 --> 32:49.565
Lexi was my friend.

32:50.667 --> 32:52.430
How could you?

32:55.772 --> 32:57.069
The tomb can be opened.

32:58.775 --> 33:01.676
- You're lying.
- Emily's grimoire, her spell book.

33:01.845 --> 33:06.111
If you know how she closed the tomb,
the reversal will be in her book.

33:06.283 --> 33:08.114
- You can open that tomb.
- Where is this book?

33:08.318 --> 33:10.513
-  l...
- You have no idea.

33:10.721 --> 33:12.382
I am telling you the truth.

33:13.824 --> 33:15.587
And I believe you.

33:16.526 --> 33:18.494
My dear, sweet Bree.

33:18.695 --> 33:20.492
That's why I'm almost sorry.

33:48.425 --> 33:51.485
So why did you bring me with you?

33:51.928 --> 33:55.329
Well, you're not the worst company
in the world, Elena.

33:55.532 --> 33:58.558
- You should give yourself more credit.
- Seriously?

33:59.036 --> 34:01.095
I don't know,
you were there in the road...

34:01.304 --> 34:03.864
...all damsel-in-distress-like.

34:04.341 --> 34:06.366
And I knew it would piss off Stefan.

34:06.543 --> 34:11.879
And you're not the worst company
in the world, Elena.

34:13.917 --> 34:17.353
- I used to be more fun.
- You did okay.

34:18.554 --> 34:20.386
I saved your life.

34:22.324 --> 34:25.021
- I know.
- And don't you forget it.

34:42.913 --> 34:44.744
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.341
You could have told me.

34:50.053 --> 34:51.145
I wanted to tell you.

34:51.353 --> 34:55.255
You said no more lies, only the truth.

34:55.425 --> 34:57.757
I can handle the truth, Stefan.

34:57.928 --> 35:02.456
As crazy as it is,
I can handle the fact you are a vampire.

35:02.999 --> 35:08.665
And you have a vampire brother
and that my best friend is a witch.

35:09.606 --> 35:12.700
I can accept the fact that
the world is a more mysterious place...

35:12.876 --> 35:14.173
...than I ever thought possible.

35:14.377 --> 35:16.504
But this?

35:16.680 --> 35:18.580
This lie, I cannot take.

35:20.750 --> 35:23.150
What am I to you?

35:23.320 --> 35:24.617
Who am I to you?

35:24.821 --> 35:26.755
You are not Katherine.

35:26.957 --> 35:29.084
You are the opposite
of everything she was.

35:29.259 --> 35:31.250
And when did you figure that out?

35:31.428 --> 35:33.589
Before you kissed me?

35:33.763 --> 35:35.390
Before we slept together?

35:38.168 --> 35:39.692
Before I met you.

35:40.904 --> 35:42.030
What?

35:42.506 --> 35:47.409
First day of school when we met.

35:48.411 --> 35:50.538
It wasn't for the first time, Elena.

35:52.449 --> 35:56.715
- Then when was it?
- May 23rd, 2009.

35:56.953 --> 35:58.477
But that was...

35:58.688 --> 36:03.318
That was the day your parents' car
went off the bridge.

36:05.295 --> 36:07.160
You were there?

36:07.330 --> 36:10.458
Every couple of years,
I come back here.

36:10.634 --> 36:13.432
To see Zach and see my home.

36:13.637 --> 36:19.667
And last spring, I was out in the woods,
by Old Wickery Bridge.

36:20.343 --> 36:22.675
And I heard the accident.

36:22.846 --> 36:24.336
All of it.

36:24.548 --> 36:27.847
I was fast getting there,
but not fast enough.

36:28.652 --> 36:31.644
Car was already submerged.

36:33.190 --> 36:38.355
Your dad, he was still conscious.
I was able to get to him.

36:38.562 --> 36:41.497
But he wouldn't let me help him...

36:42.499 --> 36:43.830
Until I helped you.

36:44.601 --> 36:46.865
Oh, my God.

36:49.673 --> 36:55.543
When I woke up in the hospital, nobody
could figure out how I got out of the car.

36:57.514 --> 36:59.243
They said it was a miracle.

36:59.416 --> 37:01.509
I went back for them.

37:01.718 --> 37:04.482
But it was too late. I couldn't...

37:05.288 --> 37:07.415
I couldn't save them.

37:07.791 --> 37:09.622
When I pulled you out...

37:09.793 --> 37:12.523
...I looked at your face
and you looked like Katherine.

37:12.696 --> 37:14.596
I couldn't believe the resemblance.

37:15.298 --> 37:18.734
After that, I spent months making sure
that you weren't her.

37:18.935 --> 37:22.427
I watched you, I learned everything
that I could about you.

37:22.606 --> 37:25.769
And I saw that you were nothing
like Katherine.

37:25.942 --> 37:30.436
And I wanted to leave town,
but, Elena, I couldn't...

37:30.614 --> 37:33.708
I couldn't leave without knowing you.

37:34.451 --> 37:37.909
I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you.
I wanted to.

37:38.088 --> 37:40.648
But you were so sad and...

37:44.561 --> 37:47.223
Why do I look like her?

37:49.132 --> 37:53.068
- Elena, you've been through so much.
- Why do I look like her, Stefan?

37:53.270 --> 37:55.033
What are you not telling me?

37:55.805 --> 37:58.103
It didn't make any sense to me.

37:58.308 --> 38:00.833
You were a Gilbert, she was a Pierce.

38:01.478 --> 38:03.241
But the resemblance was too similar.

38:03.413 --> 38:05.574
And then I learned the truth.

38:07.484 --> 38:09.475
You were adopted, Elena.

38:13.156 --> 38:14.589
There you are.

38:14.758 --> 38:15.986
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:16.559 --> 38:18.151
Okay, look.

38:18.328 --> 38:21.126
I know I don't know you,
so don't ask me why I did this.

38:21.298 --> 38:23.664
I just... Sometimes...

38:23.833 --> 38:26.495
Well, mostly all the time,
I have this need to be right.

38:26.670 --> 38:29.138
So I Googled and...

38:29.306 --> 38:31.206
- What is it?
- Proof.

38:31.875 --> 38:33.467
Sort of.

38:41.318 --> 38:44.617
- What does this mean?
- Well, I only went as far back as 1942.

38:44.788 --> 38:48.622
And found that there's been
a string of animal attacks periodically...

38:48.792 --> 38:51.818
...in and around this town,
for the past 75 years.

38:52.028 --> 38:54.155
It's consistent. Look.

38:54.664 --> 38:57.292
Here we go. In '62, five bodies found.

38:57.500 --> 39:01.334
In '53, four people killed.
In '74, three people dead.

39:01.538 --> 39:03.802
And there's been five this year.

39:04.374 --> 39:07.309
All attacked,
all suffered major blood loss.

39:07.477 --> 39:10.002
As in, drained of blood.

39:13.350 --> 39:15.614
How do you know this?

39:16.019 --> 39:19.147
Your birth certificate
from the city records.

39:19.322 --> 39:22.416
It says Elena Gilbert,
Mystic Falls General.

39:22.625 --> 39:25.856
But there's no record of your mother
ever being admitted.

39:26.029 --> 39:29.260
There's no record of her
ever being pregnant.

39:30.367 --> 39:31.994
What else do you know?

39:32.669 --> 39:35.194
I would've had to look
into the Pierce family.

39:35.372 --> 39:37.738
And I couldn't do that.
That's too much of a risk.

39:37.907 --> 39:41.070
If someone found out I was asking
about Katherine... Listen to me...

39:41.244 --> 39:42.677
...it doesn't matter.

39:42.879 --> 39:46.440
You are the woman that I love.

39:48.752 --> 39:50.083
I love you.

40:14.677 --> 40:17.373
I don't set a lot of rules, Elena.
Not with you.

40:17.547 --> 40:19.447
I trust you to tell me the truth.

40:19.682 --> 40:22.116
Where were you?
And why did you lie to me about it?

40:22.285 --> 40:26.381
- I thought we were closer than that.
- Now is not the time to talk about lies.

40:26.589 --> 40:29.683
Don't do that, don't turn this on me.
I didn't do anything.

40:29.859 --> 40:32.987
Okay, question. Am I adopted?

40:35.698 --> 40:37.962
I trust you to tell me
the truth too, Jenna.

40:38.968 --> 40:40.731
How could you not tell me?

40:40.904 --> 40:42.769
I thought we were closer than that.

40:44.574 --> 40:46.940
Elena, I didn't... They asked me not to.

40:47.143 --> 40:48.610
I don't wanna hear it.

40:55.018 --> 40:56.713
Bourbon.

41:02.459 --> 41:04.427
I love you.

41:04.828 --> 41:06.853
I'm gonna be late tonight.

41:07.305 --> 41:13.244
