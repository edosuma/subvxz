WEBVTT

00:00.446 --> 00:02.947
- You did this skydiving?
- Not exactly.

00:02.972 --> 00:05.600
I fall 9,000 feet and land, no problem,

00:05.625 --> 00:07.234
and then I trip walking to my car.

00:07.259 --> 00:09.172
Isn't that ridiculous?

00:09.197 --> 00:10.672
Well, sounds like you got off easy.

00:10.697 --> 00:13.055
Oh, what can I say?
It was on my bucket list.

00:13.219 --> 00:14.745
Okay.

00:14.770 --> 00:16.767
Let's take a look at your head.

00:17.836 --> 00:18.984
Ow.

00:19.009 --> 00:21.295
Yeah, you got a decent sized laceration

00:21.320 --> 00:22.886
- on your scalp, though.
- Ah, figured.

00:22.911 --> 00:24.644
I used half a box of Kleenex

00:24.670 --> 00:26.547
trying to stop the bleeding
on my way over here.

00:26.572 --> 00:27.920
You didn't drive yourself, did you?

00:27.945 --> 00:29.612
No, no, no, my boyfriend actually.

00:29.637 --> 00:30.976
He's out parking the car.

00:31.001 --> 00:32.922
All right,
let's get a picture of that wrist.

00:33.182 --> 00:36.156
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:39.588 --> 00:42.006
Hey, I got a request
for schedule changes.

00:42.031 --> 00:43.914
- They could use your signature.
- All righty.

00:43.939 --> 00:45.212
Right there.

00:46.157 --> 00:47.891
Hm, this one's frozen.

00:47.916 --> 00:49.649
Oh, really? I just used it.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.651
Well, I'll pull it up on the desktop.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.097
Sharon?

00:55.122 --> 00:58.501
It looks like this
screen is locked as well.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.468
Sharon, it's Bert.

01:02.713 --> 01:04.355
Maggie.

01:04.381 --> 01:06.066
Sharon.

01:07.270 --> 01:09.528
I'll go check on that monitor.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.402
What are you doing here?

01:11.427 --> 01:13.313
Is something wrong with one of the kids?

01:13.338 --> 01:15.495
No, no, no, everything's fine,
as far as I know.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.571
That's, uh, not why I'm here.

01:18.101 --> 01:21.332
Honey, Bert, over here.

01:22.344 --> 01:25.000
- "Honey"?
- Uh, that's my lady friend.

01:25.025 --> 01:28.172
She...
I think she might've broken her wrist.

01:28.197 --> 01:29.763
Excuse me.

01:32.750 --> 01:35.517
Balloon catheter is at the lesion site.

01:35.542 --> 01:37.306
Inflating now.

01:40.224 --> 01:42.102
Stent deployed.

01:42.856 --> 01:44.777
All right, let's have one last look.

01:44.802 --> 01:46.732
You can press the pedal.

01:52.356 --> 01:54.654
Dr. Bardovi?

01:55.044 --> 01:57.012
I don't know what's wrong
with the floor pedal.

01:57.037 --> 01:58.802
I'm stepping on it.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.579
Guys...

02:02.720 --> 02:03.796
Is that...

02:03.821 --> 02:05.681
What's happening?

02:10.681 --> 02:12.198
Sharon?

02:12.620 --> 02:15.488
Don't say anything, okay?
I-I need a moment to process.

02:15.513 --> 02:17.682
No, no, no, it's not that. Look.

02:17.792 --> 02:20.721
What is all this about
malware and decryption keys?

02:21.065 --> 02:22.869
It's a ransom note.

02:25.463 --> 02:27.221
We've been hacked.

02:29.456 --> 02:35.927
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:37.534 --> 02:40.626
Our sever has been
corrupted and shut down,

02:40.651 --> 02:42.807
and until we can restore the system,

02:42.832 --> 02:45.548
we'll be operating under
downtime procedure.

02:45.573 --> 02:47.237
That means paper charts.

02:47.262 --> 02:49.598
Oh, and no tablets,
people. Hand them over.

02:49.623 --> 02:52.604
So we have no access to
anyone's medical records?

02:52.629 --> 02:54.329
How... how do we do stuff?

02:54.354 --> 02:56.223
Well, there was a time not so long ago

02:56.248 --> 02:58.113
when we actually treated patients

02:58.138 --> 03:00.072
without the aid of computers.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.058
Imagine that. Tell them, Dr. Charles.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.096
Can I keep it if I
promise not to use it?

03:05.121 --> 03:06.066
Sorry, Dr. Charles,

03:06.092 --> 03:07.333
I.T. needs to check them all out.

03:07.357 --> 03:09.419
Well, it's not just the
electronic medical records

03:09.444 --> 03:12.011
that are disabled, right?
I hear imaging's down as well?

03:12.036 --> 03:13.714
Yeah, so that means what? No X-rays?

03:13.739 --> 03:15.918
And no CT scans, no MRls.

03:15.943 --> 03:18.944
We'll have to cancel elective
surgeries for the time being,

03:18.969 --> 03:21.169
but the I.T. department is confident

03:21.194 --> 03:25.152
they can disable the malware
and get us back online soon.

03:25.196 --> 03:27.613
- Isn't that right, Bruce?
- We're doing our best.

03:27.646 --> 03:29.973
And in the mean time, we'll make due.

03:29.998 --> 03:33.183
We'll use the transport
monitors to read the vitals...

03:33.208 --> 03:34.493
Yeah, I'm sorry,

03:34.518 --> 03:37.183
but the note says that if
we pay them 30 Bitcoins,

03:37.208 --> 03:39.008
they'll give us a decryption key, so...

03:39.033 --> 03:40.082
It's hospital policy

03:40.107 --> 03:42.237
not to engage with extortionists.

03:42.262 --> 03:44.563
So we're going to fly blind

03:44.588 --> 03:46.304
with one arm tied behind our back?

03:46.329 --> 03:47.379
It seems a little shortsighted.

03:47.404 --> 03:50.152
I mean, it's, what, $30,000, $40,000?

03:50.177 --> 03:51.012
It seems like nothing.

03:51.037 --> 03:52.371
Says the guy with the trust fund.

03:52.396 --> 03:54.894
We're not paying the ransom, Dr. Rhodes.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.184
We don't need to. We aren't so fragile

03:57.209 --> 03:59.603
that we could be knocked
off our game that easy.

03:59.628 --> 04:01.695
Absolutely, Ms. Goodwin.
We're up for the challenge.

04:01.721 --> 04:03.395
Thank you, Dr. Choi.

04:06.201 --> 04:09.262
- Okay, G.I. Joe.
- G.I. Choi.

04:09.287 --> 04:12.807
Back to your patients.
Increase communication, people.

04:12.832 --> 04:15.121
No blood is drawn, no test is run,

04:15.146 --> 04:18.527
and no medication is dispensed
without writing on this board.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.972
Sharon?

04:26.090 --> 04:27.990
Sharon, listen, I...

04:28.015 --> 04:29.448
I didn't want you to find out.

04:29.473 --> 04:31.239
Then you could've taken her to County.

04:31.289 --> 04:34.441
But Med was the closest and the best,

04:34.610 --> 04:36.464
not in small part because of you.

04:36.489 --> 04:37.418
Don't sweat it, Bert,

04:37.443 --> 04:40.155
I've got bigger problems
to deal with right now.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.254
I can't access any of my files.

04:50.613 --> 04:53.270
- What are we supposed to do?
- Cross our fingers

04:53.295 --> 04:55.878
and hope that some guy named
Bruce can save the day.

04:55.903 --> 04:58.044
- I can't say that I'm optimistic.
- Do you know how much research

04:58.068 --> 04:59.568
that I just have to put on hold now?

04:59.593 --> 05:01.691
This... this is unacceptable.

05:01.716 --> 05:04.942
Oh, easy there, babe.
It's not the end of the world.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.426
Are you sure about that?

05:06.451 --> 05:09.426
Because things are seeming a
little biblical around here.

05:09.451 --> 05:11.869
I mean, last night with the rats
and then today with the hacks.

05:11.894 --> 05:15.200
- Rats? What rats?
- In the vents of my apartment.

05:15.225 --> 05:17.497
It kept me up all night last night.

05:17.522 --> 05:19.364
Exterminator can't
come in till tomorrow.

05:19.389 --> 05:20.571
I...

05:20.596 --> 05:22.645
I'm gonna have to check into a hotel.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.106
No, you won't.

05:24.168 --> 05:27.488
You stay with me until this is resolved.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.082
Oh, that is exactly what
I wanted you to say.

05:32.428 --> 05:34.161
Give me that.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.045
I need this more than you do. Bye.

05:37.362 --> 05:39.047
Bye.

05:41.490 --> 05:43.137
He can't catch his breath.

05:43.162 --> 05:45.264
I mean, I tried getting him to...
To lie back on the way over,

05:45.289 --> 05:46.340
- but he just...
- He's tripoding.

05:46.365 --> 05:48.129
Trying to clear his secretions.

05:48.154 --> 05:49.620
All right, it's okay, Desmond.

05:49.645 --> 05:51.678
Just try to take a deep breath for me,
all right?

05:51.853 --> 05:54.287
- Does this hurt?
- A little.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.481
Okay.

05:55.682 --> 05:57.830
His lymph nodes are very swollen.

05:57.855 --> 05:59.543
Do you know when he
started feeling like this?

05:59.568 --> 06:01.754
Um, maybe three weeks ago?

06:02.070 --> 06:04.698
Never as bad as this.
I mean, it would come and go,

06:04.723 --> 06:06.056
so we just thought he had the flu.

06:06.081 --> 06:07.535
It's been going around his school.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.893
102.7.

06:08.918 --> 06:10.590
He just started running
that fever this morning.

06:10.615 --> 06:12.374
I mean, we got here as fast as we could.

06:12.399 --> 06:13.732
I had to find someone to cover my shift.

06:13.764 --> 06:14.606
I was out working too.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.082
I drive for a couple of
those ride-share apps.

06:16.107 --> 06:17.934
- We're just scrambling.
- I understand.

06:17.959 --> 06:20.770
- Has he had all his vaccinations?
- Yes.

06:21.226 --> 06:23.559
I mean, I... I think so.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.330
Okay, let's get him on an oxygen mask,

06:25.355 --> 06:26.528
and give him racemic epi.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.551
I'll be back to check on him soon, okay?

06:28.576 --> 06:29.641
April?

06:33.551 --> 06:36.050
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

06:36.075 --> 06:37.979
Maybe epiglottitis, maybe mumps.

06:38.004 --> 06:40.402
I mean, who knows if he's
really had all his vaccinations.

06:40.428 --> 06:41.668
Let's give him some steroids,

06:41.693 --> 06:43.262
see if we can't reduce the swelling,

06:43.287 --> 06:46.410
and let's do a CBC, CMP,
blood cultures, and a DR-70.

06:46.435 --> 06:48.116
Tumor marker?

06:48.512 --> 06:50.645
Let's see if we can get a rush on that.

06:58.611 --> 07:01.962
- Sorry.
- This board's a mess.

07:01.987 --> 07:03.969
Look around. The whole ED's a mess.

07:03.994 --> 07:05.549
We can't even send patients upstairs

07:05.574 --> 07:07.803
because we don't know if
there's beds available.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.805
What a nightmare.

07:13.626 --> 07:16.782
Okay, so before we stitch up your head,

07:16.807 --> 07:18.982
I wanna reduce the
fracture in your wrist.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.364
Here, we'll give you a little
ketamine to sedate you.

07:21.389 --> 07:23.197
I promise you won't feel a thing.

07:23.222 --> 07:25.268
Sure I can trust you, doc?

07:25.483 --> 07:26.882
Seems I'm an enemy combatant.

07:26.907 --> 07:28.291
Lover boy here failed to mention

07:28.316 --> 07:29.588
that his ex-wife is running the place.

07:29.613 --> 07:31.675
I told you Sharon was a
hospital administrator.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.244
You didn't say it was this hospital.

07:34.574 --> 07:35.978
Before we get started,

07:36.003 --> 07:38.298
you should know our EMR system's down,

07:38.323 --> 07:40.085
so I can't pull up your records.

07:40.390 --> 07:41.791
Really?

07:41.816 --> 07:43.289
Yeah, so I just need to confirm

07:43.314 --> 07:44.845
the history you already gave.

07:45.102 --> 07:47.269
Any medical problems? Prior surgeries?

07:47.294 --> 07:49.360
- Anything I should be aware of?
- No.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.125
Okay. You taking any medications?

07:51.150 --> 07:52.876
Any allergies to medications?

07:52.901 --> 07:54.704
Nada. Got a clean bill of health.

07:54.729 --> 07:57.228
Lyla's the most active
person I've ever met.

07:57.253 --> 07:59.042
Biking, tai chi.

07:59.067 --> 08:01.314
We just got back from
whitewater rafting in Chile.

08:01.339 --> 08:03.103
It's all I can do to keep up with her.

08:03.128 --> 08:05.298
Oh, look who's trying to
get in on my good side.

08:05.323 --> 08:06.666
It's working.

08:06.894 --> 08:08.656
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

08:09.642 --> 08:12.359
New history and physicals for
everyone in the psych ward?

08:12.384 --> 08:13.033
Not everyone.

08:13.058 --> 08:14.494
I mean, if they were
admitted before today,

08:14.519 --> 08:16.038
we still have backups.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.346
Still leaves about six that we lost.

08:18.371 --> 08:19.770
So, you know, we just divvy them up.

08:19.795 --> 08:20.709
Okay.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.974
Here's the catch.

08:22.999 --> 08:25.793
Even for us so-called "normal" people...

08:25.818 --> 08:26.877
Dr. Charles?

08:26.902 --> 08:29.593
Thank you.

08:30.192 --> 08:32.017
Getting hacked, it really creates...

08:32.041 --> 08:33.967
You know, it's a... It's a violation,

08:33.993 --> 08:35.462
you know, heightens your vulnerability,

08:35.488 --> 08:36.821
and that's obviously magnified

08:36.846 --> 08:38.839
for people who are dealing with, um...

08:38.864 --> 08:40.431
Anxiety and paranoia. Of course.

08:40.456 --> 08:41.645
Yeah, yeah.

08:41.671 --> 08:44.219
So I think it's just
important to not let them know

08:44.244 --> 08:46.462
why their histories are being retaken.

08:46.487 --> 08:48.695
You know, we just gotta...
We gotta finesse it a bit.

08:48.886 --> 08:50.405
Understood.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.572
Oh, I heard that they
are having a hard time

08:53.597 --> 08:56.478
filling the vacancy left
by Dr. Wheeler's death.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.142
The... I'm sorry, the E.D. residency?

08:59.167 --> 08:59.994
Yeah.

09:00.019 --> 09:01.634
I mean, you just
graduated from med school.

09:01.659 --> 09:03.926
I thought maybe you might know
somebody who's interested?

09:04.572 --> 09:05.905
Oh, darn it.

09:05.930 --> 09:08.658
Hey, Daniel, you got a minute?

09:08.683 --> 09:10.008
Yeah.

09:10.113 --> 09:12.010
Anyway, um,

09:12.060 --> 09:15.251
just give me a shout if
you're having any problems.

09:19.781 --> 09:23.683
So I hear they went
zip-lining in Costa Rica.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.982
I thought it was South
America somewhere.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.318
You knew about this?

09:29.366 --> 09:30.507
Daniel?

09:30.532 --> 09:33.269
I went and had drinks with
Bert about a month ago,

09:33.294 --> 09:35.044
and, you know, he let it slip.

09:35.069 --> 09:38.147
A month ago?
And you've just been sitting on this?

09:38.172 --> 09:40.647
Well, I kinda thought it was
more up to Bert to tell you,

09:40.672 --> 09:42.366
and I advised him to do exactly that.

09:42.391 --> 09:43.975
Yeah, well, he didn't.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.522
I'm sorry. You know, it's not so easy

09:47.547 --> 09:49.814
staying neutral throughout all this,
you know.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.327
You want me to choose sides,

09:51.352 --> 09:53.264
I'll pledge my loyalty to you right now.

09:53.289 --> 09:55.905
Not necessary. I gotta get back to work.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.074

10:04.601 --> 10:07.114
Swelling's not coming down,
and his sats are dropping.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.038
- Are we gonna need to intubate?
- We can't.

10:09.063 --> 10:11.445
If it spasms down, we
could lose his airway.

10:11.470 --> 10:14.204
Let's get an analog X-ray up
here for a lateral neck, okay?

10:14.229 --> 10:16.616
Analog? What's going on here?

10:16.648 --> 10:17.928
- Mr. Rawls, please...
- I hear you guys were hacked.

10:17.954 --> 10:19.742
Do I need to take my
son to another hospital?

10:19.774 --> 10:21.101
I seriously recommend

10:21.126 --> 10:23.420
you not moving your son
in his current condition,

10:23.445 --> 10:24.834
but I can assure you

10:24.859 --> 10:27.059
that Desmond's care will not be
compromised in the slightest.

10:27.084 --> 10:27.772
Chad...

10:28.523 --> 10:30.084
I hope you're right.

10:34.828 --> 10:36.444
Work-up back yet on my seven-year-old?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.275
The lab got them mixed
up with another patient.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.343
- They gotta run 'em again.
- Are you kidding me?

10:40.368 --> 10:42.281
It's a damn hack, okay?

10:42.306 --> 10:44.991
Uh, Ms. Goodwin,
when are we getting back online?

10:45.016 --> 10:46.936
- We're working on it.
- You said that an hour ago.

10:46.961 --> 10:49.420
I've got a dad who wants to
pull his kid out of here.

10:49.445 --> 10:52.360
You've got to stay on top of the lab.

10:52.976 --> 10:55.310
Don't worry. We'll ride this whirlwind.

10:55.335 --> 10:56.971
A little help here!

10:56.996 --> 10:58.647
- Incoming!
- A little help!

10:58.672 --> 11:00.232
My friend's been shot!

11:00.257 --> 11:02.099
- Dr. Choi?
- Get out of the way, move.

11:02.124 --> 11:03.655
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I don't have a room right now.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.295
- Out of the way.
- Mags, where are we taking him?

11:05.320 --> 11:07.967
Whoa, whoa, wait, get back up.
I don't have a room right now.

11:07.992 --> 11:09.233
- Coming through!
- Put him there.

11:09.258 --> 11:10.851
Keep this area clear!

11:10.876 --> 11:13.609
Lift him up.

11:13.634 --> 11:14.937
Park him in the hallway over there.

11:14.961 --> 11:17.061
"We're gonna ride this whirlwind"?

11:17.086 --> 11:19.095
Keep telling me that.

11:26.622 --> 11:30.583
Sats 100, BP 102 over
69, heart rate 110.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.364
A little hypotensive and tachycardic.

11:32.389 --> 11:33.780
Let's get a 16 in each arm

11:33.805 --> 11:35.702
and bolus a liter of LR
on the rapid transfuser,

11:35.727 --> 11:37.720
and 50 of fentanyl for pain.
How's the leg looking?

11:37.745 --> 11:39.853
A likely entrance hole
in the upper right thigh.

11:39.878 --> 11:41.902
Big hematoma. No apparent fracture.

11:41.927 --> 11:43.962
All right, Noah, pop quiz.
Let's see how much you recall.

11:43.987 --> 11:45.781
After we figure out
where the bullet went in,

11:45.806 --> 11:47.305
- what do we do?
- Count the holes.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.767
If there's an even number, it came out.

11:48.792 --> 11:49.689
Okay.

11:49.714 --> 11:51.267
Jason, I need you to grab the rail

11:51.292 --> 11:52.691
and roll on your side for me.

11:54.691 --> 11:57.533
- Wanna tell me what happened?
- I shot him, actually.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.872
Uh, by accident.
I thought the safety was on.

12:00.897 --> 12:03.219
I'm so sorry, man. We cool?

12:03.244 --> 12:05.361
Yeah, don't sweat it.

12:05.386 --> 12:07.127
- What kinda gun was it?
- Uh, 9 mil.

12:07.152 --> 12:08.367
And you carry it... why?

12:08.392 --> 12:09.705
You don't know my neighborhood.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.143
They got guns, I got a gun.

12:11.168 --> 12:13.001
Making the world a safer place?

12:13.026 --> 12:15.353
I think I might see an exit hole.

12:15.378 --> 12:16.877
It's tiny, but, uh...

12:16.902 --> 12:18.377
Yeah, too tiny. Probably shrapnel.

12:18.402 --> 12:19.478
Bullet's still in there somewhere.

12:19.503 --> 12:21.798
- We gotta find it.
- Systems are still down.

12:22.053 --> 12:24.424
Then we'll use the tools we have.

12:38.041 --> 12:40.641
Hey, Natalie, can I ask you a favor?

12:40.666 --> 12:42.120
Uh, one second.

12:42.145 --> 12:44.512
Uh, hey, April, can you try
and track down Connor for me?

12:44.537 --> 12:45.770
- All right.
- Thank you.

12:45.795 --> 12:46.934
Sorry, what's up?

12:46.958 --> 12:48.768
I was gonna give this to Will,
but it looks like he's busy.

12:48.793 --> 12:51.228
- Can I leave it with you?
- Sure.

12:51.253 --> 12:53.440
He's going to watch the game
with his brother tonight.

12:54.012 --> 12:55.416
I slept in it last night,

12:55.441 --> 12:57.875
and when he left this morning,
I was still in bed.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.323
I'd leave it in his locker,

12:59.348 --> 13:02.157
but I wanna make sure he gets it.

13:02.775 --> 13:04.642
- Okay.
- Thanks.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.203
You're the best.

13:19.420 --> 13:22.721
She just said she had a
out-of-body experience.

13:22.810 --> 13:24.495
Oh, that's ketamine.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.118
Lyla, do me a favor and follow
my finger with your eyes.

13:27.143 --> 13:29.094
That whole time you were
pulling on my wrist,

13:29.119 --> 13:30.557
I was floating up to the ceiling,

13:30.582 --> 13:32.205
looking down at myself.

13:32.254 --> 13:33.954
It was wonderful,

13:33.979 --> 13:35.697
though you may wanna
tell the cleaning staff

13:35.722 --> 13:37.722
there's a lot of dust in
the light fixtures up there.

13:37.782 --> 13:39.848
I'll have them look
into that immediately.

13:39.873 --> 13:42.274
Are you sure there's nothing
you left out of your history?

13:42.292 --> 13:43.752
Is something the matter?

13:43.795 --> 13:45.369
Probably not.

13:45.394 --> 13:47.336
You're having a little trouble
focusing with your eyes.

13:47.361 --> 13:49.565
That could be just a
reaction to the ketamine,

13:49.703 --> 13:51.260
but considering you suffered
the head injury, though,

13:51.285 --> 13:53.650
I am thinking I wanna bring
someone in from neurology,

13:53.675 --> 13:55.585
just to rule some things out.

13:55.686 --> 13:57.637
You know what? I'm sorry,

13:57.662 --> 14:00.002
there is one thing that
I left out of my history.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.721
Elavil. I take it for insomnia.

14:02.746 --> 14:04.487
You never said you had trouble sleeping.

14:04.512 --> 14:06.080
It's not an every night thing.

14:06.105 --> 14:08.072
Is it possible that, um,

14:08.184 --> 14:10.662
the drug had a bad
interaction with the ketamine?

14:10.687 --> 14:12.892
Yes, that might explain it.

14:12.917 --> 14:14.617
Oh, good.

14:14.642 --> 14:17.135
Then mystery solved.

14:22.494 --> 14:25.587
- Hm.
- Tell you this.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.259
He could have come in
here with Beyoncé,

14:27.284 --> 14:28.752
and it'd still be a step down from you.

14:28.777 --> 14:30.549
You don't have to say that.

14:30.612 --> 14:33.146
- It's true.
- He's lost weight.

14:33.195 --> 14:36.096
Mm-hmm. Could've been worse.

14:36.121 --> 14:37.932
Could've been a blonde.

14:37.957 --> 14:40.846
Mm.

14:42.004 --> 14:44.271
- Ms. Goodwin.
- Dr. Halstead.

14:45.777 --> 14:48.182
Any chance you got ahold
of Lyla's records yet?

14:48.207 --> 14:50.207
Are you kidding me? How?

14:50.232 --> 14:52.033
I've got no idea when
things are gonna get here.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.024
Well, in that case,
let's repeat her labs,

14:54.049 --> 14:55.377
but this time add coags and a d-dimer.

14:55.402 --> 14:57.435
Whoa, whoa, I thought you were
wrapping things up with her.

14:57.460 --> 14:58.822
Her head lac's not repaired yet, Maggie.

14:58.847 --> 15:00.737
She's not going anywhere anyway.

15:01.416 --> 15:03.870
I hope this is not another
one of your wild goose chases.

15:03.895 --> 15:05.027
What's that supposed to mean?

15:05.052 --> 15:07.674
It means keeping Bert in the E.D.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.697
is the last opposite of what
Goodwin needs right now.

15:09.838 --> 15:11.432
Well, this is a hospital, Maggie.

15:11.457 --> 15:13.619
I know I don't need to remind
you whose needs come first.

15:13.644 --> 15:16.159
You want new labs? Fine.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.018
We're doing paper today.

15:19.624 --> 15:21.885
How 'bout filling these out?

15:28.143 --> 15:30.148
Hey, what do we got?

15:30.438 --> 15:32.844
You've really gotta
retrace all your steps.

15:33.334 --> 15:34.625
Uh-huh.

15:34.650 --> 15:36.164
I don't understand

15:36.189 --> 15:38.708
why the network isn't
constantly backing itself up.

15:38.733 --> 15:41.250
Hard drives are so cheap these days.

15:41.851 --> 15:44.998
Hey, Dr. Charles says, um,

15:45.023 --> 15:48.007
they're looking to fill the
open residency in the E.D.

15:48.032 --> 15:50.577
That's great news, isn't it?

15:50.602 --> 15:52.591
- Why?
- 'Cause now you can take it.

15:52.616 --> 15:53.994
Isn't that the position that you wanted

15:54.019 --> 15:56.304
before Dr. Charles pulled
you into psychiatry?

15:56.329 --> 15:57.998
You're missing the point, Joey.

15:58.023 --> 15:58.961
What point?

15:58.986 --> 16:01.019
Why would Dr. Ch...

16:01.376 --> 16:04.515
Why would Dr. Charles bring
this up in the first place?

16:05.189 --> 16:08.123
I mean, he sounded innocent enough,

16:08.149 --> 16:09.508
and since I just graduated med school,

16:09.533 --> 16:11.163
maybe I knew someone who'd want the job,

16:11.188 --> 16:14.945
but I can't help thinking that
he's got some kind of agenda.

16:15.555 --> 16:17.956
Is he dissatisfied with my performance?

16:17.981 --> 16:20.013
- Is he trying to get rid of me?
- Well, look at it this way.

16:20.038 --> 16:21.578
Everyone thought that
you were really good

16:21.602 --> 16:23.525
in emergency medicine.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.834
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

16:26.859 --> 16:28.609
Yeah.

16:30.546 --> 16:32.646
You know, Joey,

16:32.671 --> 16:35.829
you and I don't communicate very well.

16:39.382 --> 16:40.688
You see there?

16:40.712 --> 16:42.406
Look how narrow this boy's trachea is.

16:42.438 --> 16:43.992
It's no wider than a cocktail straw.

16:44.428 --> 16:45.764
I assume you've started a work-up?

16:45.789 --> 16:47.039
Still gummed up in the lab.

16:47.064 --> 16:48.451
I started treating him for epiglottitis,

16:48.476 --> 16:50.176
but that's clearly not the problem.

16:50.201 --> 16:51.328
Lymphs?

16:51.353 --> 16:53.266
It's hard to exclude cancer
from the differential.

16:53.290 --> 16:55.303
We need to address his airway issue.

16:55.328 --> 16:57.439
Can we remove the lymph
nodes? Get a biopsy?

16:57.464 --> 16:59.890
Surgically, we're never
gonna get an ET tube down him

16:59.915 --> 17:01.499
in this condition,
and Marty's gonna be hesitant

17:01.524 --> 17:04.328
- to put him under general.
- So what can we do?

17:05.446 --> 17:07.614
How still do you think this kid can be?

17:10.944 --> 17:12.452
What's that you're spraying on him?

17:12.477 --> 17:13.742
Ethyl chloride.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.444
And you're positive he
won't feel anything?

17:15.470 --> 17:17.325
Maybe a slight pinch, but that's it.

17:17.349 --> 17:18.883
Now the most important thing

17:18.907 --> 17:21.084
is for you to stay extremely still

17:21.108 --> 17:22.474
while we're doing this, Desmond.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.055
- You think you can do that?
- Yeah.

17:24.079 --> 17:25.612
You know what I find works sometimes?

17:25.637 --> 17:27.257
Is if you close your eyes

17:27.282 --> 17:29.576
and you squeeze my hand as hard
as you can until it's over.

17:29.601 --> 17:32.039
How does that sound? Good? Okay.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.890
- So... okay.
- Okay.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.088
Oh, God.

17:44.113 --> 17:46.318
- Mommy?
- It's okay, D.

17:46.343 --> 17:48.664
- Mommy?
- Just a little bit longer.

17:48.689 --> 17:51.383
- No!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

17:51.408 --> 17:54.485
Okay.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.678
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

17:56.703 --> 17:59.662
I think we got enough
tissue to send to pathology.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.054
You should see this, Jason. It's cool.

18:05.079 --> 18:06.429
The bullet's, like, in your heart.

18:06.454 --> 18:07.921
Cool for you.

18:08.309 --> 18:09.597
He shot me in the leg.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.937
What the hell is it doing up here?

18:10.962 --> 18:12.929
Bullets travel in unexpected ways.

18:12.954 --> 18:14.179
Well, we need to get that out, right?

18:14.204 --> 18:15.133
One step at a time.

18:15.158 --> 18:16.719
I can't tell yet whether
it's actually in the heart

18:16.744 --> 18:18.058
or just behind it.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.461
Well, what about those X-rays
we took earlier?

18:20.486 --> 18:22.486
Well, they're not that precise.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.054
Well, find something that is.

18:24.079 --> 18:26.013
What about that MIR machine?

18:26.038 --> 18:29.206
MRI? And it's not, um, usable right now.

18:29.231 --> 18:30.867
- What do you mean?
- Look, if we can figure out

18:30.892 --> 18:32.515
the path the bullet took
to get to your chest,

18:32.540 --> 18:34.607
we should be able to
determine exactly where it is.

18:34.632 --> 18:35.844
There are only two options, right?

18:35.869 --> 18:38.039
Right, well,
either it caromed to your midsection,

18:38.064 --> 18:39.945
or it hitched a ride up
through your venous system.

18:39.970 --> 18:41.749
Good. Grab a DPL.

18:41.941 --> 18:43.289
Uh, DPL?

18:43.314 --> 18:45.114
A Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage.

18:45.139 --> 18:46.812
We're gonna insert a
needle in your abdomen,

18:46.837 --> 18:48.008
fill it with fluid,

18:48.033 --> 18:50.249
then drain it to see if
there's any internal bleeding.

18:50.274 --> 18:52.702
Don't worry, we'll drape off this area

18:52.727 --> 18:54.133
before we insert the Foley.

18:54.353 --> 18:56.203
What do you mean, "insert the Foley"?

18:56.228 --> 18:58.721
Oh, this goes up your urethra.

18:59.332 --> 19:01.086
First you shoot me,

19:01.111 --> 19:03.570
then you bring me to a
place from the Dark Ages.

19:03.595 --> 19:05.645
You really suck, Marius.

19:07.722 --> 19:09.476
My fault.

19:12.393 --> 19:14.469
Oh... Excuse me.

19:14.494 --> 19:15.614
Uh...

19:15.638 --> 19:17.657
Hey, Bert,

19:17.682 --> 19:20.804
um, can I ask you...

19:20.829 --> 19:23.830
Have you talked to the
children about this?

19:24.269 --> 19:25.769
Not yet.

19:25.794 --> 19:28.258
I was waiting to see if
it was serious or not.

19:28.283 --> 19:29.752
And is it?

19:30.195 --> 19:31.515
Sharon...

19:31.540 --> 19:36.163
You know, maybe,
you should speak to your children.

19:40.601 --> 19:43.156
Oh, man, she's a trip wire.

19:43.181 --> 19:45.109
How'd you expect her to react?

19:45.134 --> 19:47.093
This city is filthy with hospitals,

19:47.118 --> 19:48.651
but you decided to come here.

19:48.676 --> 19:50.570
To do what?

19:50.595 --> 19:53.562
- To rub it in Sharon's face?
- Oh, come on.

19:54.190 --> 19:55.703
How old is she anyway?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.288
What does that have to do with anything?

19:57.313 --> 20:00.039
Okay. When did you meet her?

20:00.064 --> 20:02.660
I know what you're implying.

20:02.913 --> 20:05.172
Lyla wasn't even in the picture

20:05.197 --> 20:07.227
till way after Sharon and I split up.

20:07.252 --> 20:09.531
Split up? Uh-uh.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.961
You walked out on her.

20:19.783 --> 20:23.250
Okay, so Bruce is no closer
to fixing this malware.

20:23.275 --> 20:24.392
And the FBI?

20:24.417 --> 20:26.417
Oh, come on,
let's not hold our breath there.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.409
You know, I...

20:28.825 --> 20:31.726
I think it's time to consider
putting the hospital on bypass.

20:31.751 --> 20:33.884
What is that?
Sending patients to other hospitals?

20:33.909 --> 20:36.541
Do you know how much
revenue that is gonna cost?

20:36.566 --> 20:38.064
A few hundred thousand.

20:38.089 --> 20:39.522
That's just today.
You can double it tomorrow.

20:39.547 --> 20:41.213
I mean, the board is gonna plotz.

20:41.238 --> 20:43.732
What do you suggest then? We're full up.

20:43.757 --> 20:47.181
My doctors are treating
gunshot wounds in the hallway.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.498
Listen...

20:50.030 --> 20:53.595
we keep a little cash on-hand
for a rainy day, okay?

20:53.620 --> 20:56.078
So we could pay this ransom,
and no one would ever know.

20:56.103 --> 20:57.368
- No.
- Why not?

20:57.393 --> 20:59.619
And do not say,
"Because it's bad precedent."

20:59.643 --> 21:01.205
It's a horrendous precedent.

21:01.230 --> 21:04.970
These hackers are putting
people's lives at risk.

21:04.995 --> 21:07.173
They're compromising their care.

21:07.198 --> 21:09.259
You can't reward behavior like that.

21:09.284 --> 21:11.072
Besides, you pay them now,

21:11.097 --> 21:13.115
what stops them from doing it again

21:13.140 --> 21:15.407
or holding the hospital
next-door hostage?

21:15.432 --> 21:17.866
I don't care about the
hospital next-door.

21:20.103 --> 21:23.415
We cannot let them win, Peter.

21:25.635 --> 21:27.900
You wanna stick to
your guns, that's fine,

21:27.925 --> 21:30.329
but you are the one who's
gonna tell the board.

21:30.501 --> 21:33.681
Spread the word and notify IDPH

21:33.706 --> 21:36.111
the hospital's now on full diversion.

21:36.144 --> 21:37.158
Yes, ma'am.

21:39.220 --> 21:41.929
Give me IDPH.

21:45.314 --> 21:47.422
Yeah, I need a home for a chest pain,

21:47.447 --> 21:49.508
a dog bite, and a flu. Thank you.

21:49.533 --> 21:50.846
You got any room?

21:50.871 --> 21:53.055
Ah, thank you. I owe you.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.861
Leah, tell any walk-ins
who can fend themselves

21:55.886 --> 21:59.087
that we'll be arranging for
transport to Rush and Mercy.

21:59.112 --> 22:00.587
Okay?

22:01.059 --> 22:03.821
Hey, have you heard from pathology yet?

22:03.846 --> 22:04.992
Let me give them another call.

22:05.016 --> 22:06.742
Please.

22:08.818 --> 22:11.079
It's busy. I'll check back in a minute.

22:11.104 --> 22:12.957
Okay.

22:13.095 --> 22:14.959
You look worried.

22:15.396 --> 22:18.588
I do? That's not good.

22:19.201 --> 22:21.634
I just...

22:21.659 --> 22:23.893
I lost so many kids to cancer this year

22:23.918 --> 22:26.587
that every time one comes in now,
with the same symptoms,

22:26.612 --> 22:30.236
I just... I can't help but
feel the fear rising in me,

22:30.261 --> 22:32.228
and it's all I can do to control it,

22:32.253 --> 22:34.150
so that I don't scare the family.

22:34.404 --> 22:36.759
Dr. Manning, I've got
your biopsy results.

22:36.784 --> 22:38.243
Pathology called me in.

22:38.268 --> 22:41.777
Why is an epidemiologist
getting called in on this?

22:45.496 --> 22:47.291
Coccidioidomycosis?

22:47.316 --> 22:48.728
Otherwise known as Valley Fever,

22:48.753 --> 22:50.353
and it's highly infectious.

22:50.378 --> 22:52.502
Thank God.

22:52.527 --> 22:54.307
You realize this is a serious illness?

22:54.331 --> 22:56.923
Yes. No, yes, absolutely.

22:56.948 --> 22:59.642
Um, but at least it isn't cancer.

23:02.307 --> 23:04.657
That's what was causing
the fever and the swelling?

23:04.682 --> 23:06.127
A fungal infection?

23:06.152 --> 23:07.932
Spores are typically found in soil,

23:07.956 --> 23:09.456
predominantly in desert locales.

23:09.481 --> 23:11.775
Valley Fever is an endemic
of the Great Lakes region.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.267
Have you spent anytime in
the Southwest recently?

23:14.292 --> 23:16.954
California? Nevada? Arizona?

23:16.979 --> 23:19.226
No, Desmond's never been
further away from home

23:19.251 --> 23:20.947
- than Grand Rapids.
- None of us has.

23:20.972 --> 23:22.416
Okay, well, we'd like to start your son

23:22.441 --> 23:24.829
on a round of IV antifungals right away.

23:24.854 --> 23:26.127
But I do have to warn you,

23:26.152 --> 23:27.900
it's strong medicine with the
potential of side effects,

23:27.925 --> 23:30.431
- but it is what he needs.
- Thank you, doctors.

23:30.456 --> 23:32.454
I'll get started on Desmond.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.712
Uh, I'm sorry, uh, but your son

23:34.737 --> 23:36.368
is the second person I've
seen with this disease.

23:36.393 --> 23:38.728
I'm gonna need a detailed
history from the both of you.

23:38.753 --> 23:40.786
It could help me find the
source of the infection.

23:40.811 --> 23:42.697
I mean, can we do this later?

23:42.722 --> 23:44.291
We just wanna be with
our child right now.

23:44.316 --> 23:45.829
It's important that we find this

23:45.854 --> 23:48.154
before someone else's
child gets infected.

23:48.179 --> 23:50.146
I can sit with you one at
a time if that's better.

23:50.171 --> 23:52.390
You go. Be with Desmond.

23:53.234 --> 23:55.562
Oh, thank you.

23:56.353 --> 23:58.797
At first,
I thought it was just the sedation.

23:58.822 --> 24:01.283
You know, but her eyes...
She's just not able to focus.

24:01.308 --> 24:03.713
I had her fix on my finger
from about this distance.

24:03.738 --> 24:06.111
They dart back and forth to
a random space over here.

24:06.136 --> 24:08.549
- Almost mechanical.
- A square wave jerk.

24:08.574 --> 24:09.737
Exactly.

24:09.761 --> 24:13.111
So any time I get a...
an eye thing after a fall on the head,

24:13.136 --> 24:15.213
I'm thinking, you know,
possible stroke, but...

24:15.238 --> 24:17.415
Did your work-up come back negative?

24:17.440 --> 24:18.906
Yeah.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.017
Any idea what else this might be?

24:21.042 --> 24:22.916
It could be anything from
a basal ganglia disorder

24:22.941 --> 24:24.174
to normal aging.

24:24.199 --> 24:27.056
It's impossible to tell
without a head CT or an MRI.

24:28.618 --> 24:31.048
You know, maybe if you just
examine her yourself...

24:31.073 --> 24:34.081
Do I need to explain the
definition of impossible to you?

24:34.105 --> 24:35.853
I'm a neurosurgeon, not a magician.

24:35.878 --> 24:37.798
Just find someone who can get
the scans back up and running,

24:37.823 --> 24:39.769
and then maybe we can all do our jobs.

24:43.705 --> 24:46.363
Any word on when we might
be getting our network back?

24:46.388 --> 24:47.666
Sorry.

24:49.636 --> 24:51.486
You think they still need my tablet?

24:51.511 --> 24:53.534
I'm afraid so, Dr. Charles.

24:53.753 --> 24:56.520
Dr. Charles, hey, about those H and Ps,

24:56.545 --> 24:58.438
Mrs. Kornbluth in Room 17...

24:58.463 --> 25:00.220
She was admitted
experiencing hallucinations.

25:00.245 --> 25:01.853
- Okay, and?
- At intake,

25:01.878 --> 25:04.025
it was determined that she was
having a psychotic episode,

25:04.050 --> 25:05.111
but after speaking with her,

25:05.136 --> 25:07.658
I think she simply might've had
an adverse reaction to Ambien.

25:07.683 --> 25:09.017
You know, this has all proven to be

25:09.042 --> 25:10.689
an incredible inconvenience,
I just wanna say.

25:10.714 --> 25:12.624
I cannot believe that our patients'
psychiatric histories

25:12.649 --> 25:14.806
aren't hosted on a
separate secure network,

25:14.831 --> 25:16.131
and that HIPPA hadn't mandated that.

25:16.156 --> 25:18.056
Moving forward, you know, maybe...

25:18.081 --> 25:20.114
But in the mean time, uh,

25:20.139 --> 25:22.373
it might've been beneficial
for us to retrace our steps.

25:22.397 --> 25:25.543
I am running some tests now,
but I think we might be able to

25:25.568 --> 25:27.501
discharge Mrs. Kornbluth later today.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.695
Oh, there's the I.T. guy.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.363
Bruce...

25:40.820 --> 25:42.549
Old rule of thumb,

25:42.826 --> 25:45.165
if you can read through the bag,
the test is negative.

25:48.878 --> 25:51.267
So there's no bleeding in the abdomen?

25:51.367 --> 25:54.408
- No.
- Well, that's good news, right?

25:57.030 --> 25:59.274
So you want me to crack this guys'
chest open

25:59.299 --> 26:01.158
and put him on bypass on a hunch?

26:01.183 --> 26:03.687
Not a hunch. The diagnosis of exclusion.

26:03.712 --> 26:06.079
- And what if you're wrong?
- He's not wrong.

26:06.104 --> 26:07.496
I mean, the DPL ruled out

26:07.521 --> 26:09.160
the bullet travelling
through the peritoneum,

26:09.185 --> 26:11.018
and if it went through
the retroperitoneum,

26:11.043 --> 26:12.941
then he would have reported back pain,

26:12.966 --> 26:14.866
so it had to have embolized.

26:15.370 --> 26:18.304
Dr. Choi... He knows his stuff.

26:18.329 --> 26:20.412
It's how he does it on the battlefield.

26:24.158 --> 26:26.277
So we can't just transfer this guy

26:26.302 --> 26:28.480
to another trauma center
with a working CT?

26:28.505 --> 26:29.441
Too risky.

26:29.466 --> 26:30.886
He could decompensate at any moment,

26:30.911 --> 26:32.402
and every second we
wait just ups the risk

26:32.427 --> 26:35.374
- of a massive pulmonary embolism.
- All right, I'll call the O.R.

26:35.399 --> 26:36.285
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

26:36.310 --> 26:38.737
I don't understand
what is taking so long.

26:38.762 --> 26:39.800
Get him going. I'll meet you up there.

26:39.825 --> 26:40.527
Yeah.

26:40.552 --> 26:41.558
If I could just access my files,

26:41.583 --> 26:43.410
I'm sure I could find a
link between these cases.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.379
I'm sorry, but I was told by I.T.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.809
that the malware is quite sophisticated.

26:47.834 --> 26:49.262
Then why don't you just pay the ransom?

26:49.286 --> 26:51.753
It's not that simple, Robin.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.269
But it is that simple.

26:53.294 --> 26:54.688
It's... it's right
there on every screen.

26:54.713 --> 26:56.379
Easy instructions to pay the ransom

26:56.404 --> 26:57.886
and obtain a decryption key.

26:57.911 --> 26:59.495
A three-year-old could figure it out.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.176
Hey, Robin, what's,
uh... What's going on?

27:01.201 --> 27:02.683
What's going on is there
might be an epidemic

27:02.708 --> 27:04.847
of Valley Fever breaking out,
and no one seems to care.

27:04.872 --> 27:06.696
Let me remind you, Ms. Charles,

27:06.721 --> 27:09.121
in case the air is too thin to breathe

27:09.146 --> 27:10.598
atop that soap box,

27:10.623 --> 27:13.011
that you are an epidemiologist,

27:13.059 --> 27:16.425
and I am the one responsible
for running this hospital.

27:16.450 --> 27:18.848
Why don't we just take
a second to cool down?

27:18.872 --> 27:20.839
- Why don't we?
- Don't handle me.

27:35.051 --> 27:38.619
Hey, Barry Lindheim again.

27:38.714 --> 27:40.479
Thinks you're dodging his calls.

27:40.504 --> 27:43.120
Smart man. Tell him you can't find me.

27:43.145 --> 27:44.878
Okay.

28:05.201 --> 28:07.064
Back online?

28:07.575 --> 28:09.930
I guess this means that
we are off of bypass?

28:09.955 --> 28:12.071
Yes, we are off of bypass.

28:12.096 --> 28:13.834
Hallelujah. Thank you, Sharon.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.126
No, no, thank him. He's the real hero.

28:16.151 --> 28:17.587
Bruce, great job.

28:17.924 --> 28:20.325
I'm sorry, I-I didn't do anything.

28:21.072 --> 28:22.345
What?

28:24.700 --> 28:26.963
The system came back up on its own.

28:26.988 --> 28:29.479
Someone must've paid the ransom.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.330
You didn't authorize this?

28:33.355 --> 28:34.728
Then who did?

28:48.635 --> 28:50.323
Peter...

28:51.049 --> 28:53.750
I thought we agreed we
weren't gonna pay the ransom.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.377
We didn't pay the ransom.

28:55.619 --> 28:57.735
- Then what happened?
- Who knows.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.687
Look, maybe the hackers felt
the feds were getting close,

28:59.712 --> 29:00.823
and they bailed.

29:00.848 --> 29:02.759
In any case, the
problem's been resolved,

29:02.784 --> 29:06.399
and we can get back to business,
saving lives, making money.

29:06.424 --> 29:09.149
Someone countermanded my orders, Peter.

29:09.174 --> 29:10.713
Sharon, whoever that person was,

29:10.738 --> 29:11.892
they did us a huge favor,

29:11.917 --> 29:14.503
so let's not look a gift
horse in the mouth, okay?

29:19.544 --> 29:23.327
Preliminary visual inspection
shows no pericardial effusion.

29:23.352 --> 29:25.139
Thank you, Dr. Bardovi.

29:25.977 --> 29:28.463
I was just informed
that we're back online,

29:28.488 --> 29:30.346
in case that's pertinent.

29:30.652 --> 29:32.596
Well, we're not gonna close him back up

29:32.621 --> 29:35.533
and send him to radiology just
to wind up where we are now,

29:35.558 --> 29:37.229
so let's ultrasound the heart directly

29:37.254 --> 29:39.444
and see if we can't find the bullet.

29:43.087 --> 29:45.806
There, in the right ventricle.

29:45.831 --> 29:47.487
Yeah, that could be our culprit.

29:47.573 --> 29:48.905
Scalpel?

29:58.188 --> 29:59.659
Forceps?

30:16.245 --> 30:17.645
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:17.670 --> 30:18.471
Nice work.

30:18.496 --> 30:20.275
I guess that Navy training
wasn't a waste after all.

30:20.300 --> 30:21.823
That's how we do it on the battlefield.

30:21.848 --> 30:23.675
Well, if it hadn't worked,
I would've blamed you anyway.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.833
I know.

30:26.175 --> 30:28.803
Hey, Dr. Rhodes, I
don't know if you heard,

30:28.828 --> 30:30.666
but somebody paid the ransom,

30:30.691 --> 30:33.220
an open violation of hospital policy.

30:33.245 --> 30:35.948
What, you think it was me?
I'm sorry, Ms. Goodwin,

30:35.973 --> 30:37.908
but as much as I would
like to take credit,

30:37.933 --> 30:40.745
- I didn't do it.
- Well, somebody paid.

30:41.112 --> 30:42.678
Was it you, Sam?

30:42.703 --> 30:44.588
My kid starts Sarah
Lawrence in the fall.

30:44.598 --> 30:46.446
Not a chance in hell I'm
cutting a check that size

30:46.471 --> 30:47.847
to solve your problem.

30:48.363 --> 30:49.902
Okay, so you're telling me

30:49.927 --> 30:51.877
nobody here knows anything about this?

30:51.902 --> 30:53.463
You got a second?

30:53.920 --> 30:56.080
What? You... you think I need a timeout?

30:56.105 --> 30:57.041
No.

30:57.066 --> 30:59.229
I'm not endorsing any
kind of palace coup,

30:59.254 --> 31:00.799
but I just...

31:00.824 --> 31:02.800
I understand any number of motivations

31:02.825 --> 31:04.992
why somebody would wanna
get that thing paid.

31:05.017 --> 31:07.133
I've completely freaked myself out

31:07.158 --> 31:09.009
how much I miss this thing, you know,

31:09.034 --> 31:10.809
which has clearly become a powerful tool

31:10.834 --> 31:13.221
that I use to maintain
distance between myself

31:13.246 --> 31:16.254
and the world, you know...
Control my environment.

31:16.389 --> 31:17.855
And that's a slippery slope, man...

31:17.880 --> 31:20.097
Control, you know... For all of us.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.762
I mean, one second
you're steady in command.

31:21.787 --> 31:25.267
Next second, it's like...
Ahh, rogue wave, you know,

31:25.292 --> 31:27.917
hackers, relationships we can't control.

31:27.942 --> 31:29.429
Come on, Daniel.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.769
Are you trying to bait and switch me?

31:31.818 --> 31:34.719
I'm not in denial.
I know my husband is gone.

31:34.744 --> 31:37.542
I may never get a good
answer for why he left,

31:37.567 --> 31:41.369
but I sure as hell can find
out who paid that ransom.

31:46.735 --> 31:48.768
Your son is taking
well to the medication.

31:48.793 --> 31:49.962
Hopefully in a couple days,

31:49.987 --> 31:51.524
he'll be able to take this orally

31:51.549 --> 31:54.438
- and we can send him home.
- Thank you, Dr. Manning.

31:54.463 --> 31:56.331
I'm glad we brought him here.

31:57.097 --> 32:00.134
We did, however,
get your test results back as well.

32:00.159 --> 32:01.825
Ivie, yours came back negative.

32:01.850 --> 32:04.517
Chad, however, you tested positive.

32:04.724 --> 32:06.298
Positive? But I feel fine.

32:06.323 --> 32:08.633
It just means you've come
in contact with a spore.

32:08.658 --> 32:10.454
A lot of people never
become symptomatic,

32:10.479 --> 32:12.579
but moving forward,
it is something to monitor.

32:12.604 --> 32:15.056
Mr. Rawls, I think I found a connection

32:15.081 --> 32:17.144
between Desmond and my other patient.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.736
You told me earlier you
use your car to ride-share.

32:19.761 --> 32:22.642
- Yeah. Why?
- My patient last week...

32:22.667 --> 32:24.567
She rode in your car 18 days ago.

32:24.592 --> 32:26.071
I mean, if you say so.

32:26.096 --> 32:27.796
No way I can remember everyone I drove.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.490
Did you park it here?
I'd like to take a look at it.

32:30.515 --> 32:31.955
I don't understand.

32:31.980 --> 32:34.400
Why would my car be making people sick?

32:39.301 --> 32:41.733
I apologize, Lyla, for the delay.

32:41.758 --> 32:43.783
I know you must be eager
to get out of here.

32:43.808 --> 32:45.408
Yeah, are you gonna
stitch me up or what?

32:45.433 --> 32:46.619
I am, uh,

32:46.644 --> 32:48.541
but now that our imaging
system's come back online,

32:48.566 --> 32:49.699
I'd... I'd like to get you down

32:49.733 --> 32:51.713
for a CT scan of your head first.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.364
I just grazed my head.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.346
- It's really not a big deal.
- I hear ya.

32:55.371 --> 32:58.119
Still, standard of care
requires me to get a head CT,

32:58.144 --> 33:00.923
so blame it on insurance companies,
if you must.

33:00.948 --> 33:03.813
Hey, I couldn't, uh, decide what to get,

33:03.838 --> 33:06.157
so I bought the whole rack.

33:08.298 --> 33:10.431
Did I miss something?

33:10.880 --> 33:13.047
Uh, Dr. Halstead just said

33:13.072 --> 33:16.095
that it might be a couple more
hours until he can stitch me up.

33:16.260 --> 33:19.571
You mind running to my
place and walking the dog?

33:19.596 --> 33:21.563
No, of course. I'll hurry back.

33:21.588 --> 33:23.502
Okay, thanks, babe.

33:30.077 --> 33:32.905
Why do I get the impression
there's something going on

33:32.929 --> 33:34.616
you don't want either of us to know?

33:38.408 --> 33:40.780
You don't have to send
me down for the CT scan.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.850
I can tell you what it's gonna show.

33:50.686 --> 33:54.716
Dr. Halstead,
I got a message you wanted to see me.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.053
Yes and no.

33:56.078 --> 33:59.027
Actually, Ms. Dempsey would
like to speak with you.

34:01.798 --> 34:03.288
Why?

34:04.450 --> 34:06.217
Mm-mm.

34:13.585 --> 34:16.163
I was told you wanted to speak with me.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.598
Yes, thank you.

34:19.060 --> 34:22.460
Yeah, this is pretty much
as awkward as I imagined,

34:23.195 --> 34:25.092
but now that I told Dr. Halstead,

34:25.117 --> 34:26.981
I assumed it was a matter of time

34:27.005 --> 34:29.317
before the head of the
hospital found out as well.

34:30.174 --> 34:33.476
Last year,
I was diagnosed with a disease called

34:33.635 --> 34:37.136
progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP,

34:37.161 --> 34:39.121
which is a poor relation to Parkinson's.

34:39.147 --> 34:41.830
I'm familiar with PSP.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.833
I'm sorry.

34:44.304 --> 34:46.167
What's your prognosis?

34:46.987 --> 34:51.172
Five more years, maybe ten.

34:51.705 --> 34:54.938
What are you gonna do?
Seize the day, right?

34:56.578 --> 35:01.349
I'm still able to hide the
symptoms for the most part,

35:01.918 --> 35:04.227
at least from lay people,

35:05.624 --> 35:08.607
which is why I wanted to talk to you.

35:09.465 --> 35:12.611
You haven't told Bert, have you?

35:13.028 --> 35:16.262
Wanna scare off a potential
guy lickety-split?

35:16.413 --> 35:19.618
Tell him in three years you
won't be able to swallow

35:19.858 --> 35:21.621
or chew...

35:23.241 --> 35:25.749
or breathe without their help.

35:29.037 --> 35:33.745
I didn't get a lot of
calls for a second date,

35:33.770 --> 35:35.718
so when I met Bert...

35:36.269 --> 35:39.076
Look...

35:39.101 --> 35:41.544
Bert and I may have run our course,

35:41.569 --> 35:45.060
but keeping this from him

35:45.925 --> 35:49.513
- is a mistake.
- I'm selfish, I know.

35:53.065 --> 35:54.630
I'm scared

35:54.655 --> 35:59.658
to spend the last few years
of my life alone, you know.

36:02.695 --> 36:04.373
Yes, I do.

36:11.573 --> 36:13.286
How long have you owned this car?

36:13.311 --> 36:14.373
About two months.

36:14.398 --> 36:15.988
Bought it used from some
place out in Hillside.

36:16.013 --> 36:17.966
Only had 40,000 miles on it.

36:18.303 --> 36:20.341
Do you know anything
about the previous owner?

36:20.366 --> 36:21.513
No.

36:22.442 --> 36:24.371
So what exactly are we looking for here?

36:24.396 --> 36:25.795
- That's the ride-share app.
- Yeah.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.832
- What's this?
- Uh, I don't know.

36:27.857 --> 36:29.123
It was on there when we bought it.

36:29.148 --> 36:32.045
"FAT"... it's not something
you really wanna advertise,

36:32.069 --> 36:34.036
but we couldn't get the
sticker off the car.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.497
That's actually an IATA code.

36:35.522 --> 36:38.356
It's an airport abbreviation.
That's Fresno International.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.782
California, Central Valley?

36:41.065 --> 36:44.066
I suspect your car might have
spores in the air filters.

36:44.091 --> 36:46.114
They could stay active that long?

36:46.139 --> 36:49.138
Yeah, I'm sorry, but the CDC's
gonna have to impound your car.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.630
And we're gonna need to check and notify

36:50.655 --> 36:52.677
every passenger you have had.

36:52.702 --> 36:57.819
Okay, it's... I know...

36:57.844 --> 37:00.176
Hey, Mags, I need to leave early.

37:00.201 --> 37:01.669
I gotta let the plumber in my apartment.

37:01.694 --> 37:04.333
Why can't your girlfriend,
Vicki, do that for you?

37:04.468 --> 37:06.403
She got deployed. Germany.

37:06.428 --> 37:08.669
Oh, that must be hard on the two of you.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.979
Well, it's not the two of us anymore.

37:11.004 --> 37:12.237
Oh.

37:12.262 --> 37:13.404
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:13.429 --> 37:15.201
Hey, we dodged a bullet
with that GSW earlier...

37:15.226 --> 37:16.310
- Ah.
- So to speak.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.610
So to speak.

37:17.988 --> 37:20.138
Noah thinks you're some
sort of a miracle worker.

37:20.163 --> 37:23.028
Nah, just a guy who's seen
way too many shootings.

37:23.195 --> 37:24.825
Oh, Dr. Charles, hey,

37:24.850 --> 37:26.883
I just finished the last history.

37:26.917 --> 37:29.044
It was fascinating, really.
The patient thought I was an...

37:29.069 --> 37:30.427
An FBI agent. I saw.

37:30.452 --> 37:32.625
The system's back up. But thank you.

37:32.839 --> 37:34.552
Dr. Charles?

37:35.960 --> 37:38.342
If you wanna fire me,
why don't you just do it already?

37:38.366 --> 37:39.665
Fire you?

37:39.690 --> 37:42.491
Wait, why would I wanna fire you?

37:42.516 --> 37:43.728
Okay, I might not be

37:43.768 --> 37:45.489
the greatest psych intern of all time,

37:45.514 --> 37:47.731
but I know a little bit about subtext

37:47.756 --> 37:49.427
and the cognitive unconscious,

37:49.452 --> 37:51.338
and so when you tell me that
there's an opening in the E.D.,

37:51.363 --> 37:53.099
I'm left to wonder...
does that mean you want me to quit psych

37:53.124 --> 37:55.624
- and take that job?
- No.

37:55.827 --> 37:58.261
No, it does not mean that at all.

37:58.286 --> 38:00.349
Because I am not quitting.

38:00.382 --> 38:01.902
I am sticking with this all the way,

38:01.927 --> 38:03.224
and so if you wanna get rid of me,

38:03.249 --> 38:05.489
you're gonna have to do more
than just try to get in my head.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.738
Leah, thank you.

38:14.763 --> 38:16.552
That was a good job today.

38:16.577 --> 38:18.344
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

38:23.172 --> 38:25.247
I forgot you were a pacer.

38:25.272 --> 38:26.419
Wore out the rug

38:26.444 --> 38:28.888
every time you were
in the delivery room.

38:29.512 --> 38:30.873
I don't know why I'm doing it now.

38:30.898 --> 38:32.552
Lyla's just getting stitches.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.979
Nobody ever died of that, right?

38:35.228 --> 38:38.063
Well, I'm sure it'll all work out.

38:38.088 --> 38:39.858
Sharon, um,

38:40.267 --> 38:43.543
I know it was incredibly
insensitive of me

38:43.568 --> 38:46.269
to bring Lyla into your E.D.

38:46.431 --> 38:49.229
You don't deserve to
be treated like this.

38:49.254 --> 38:51.325
- Bert...
- I owe you an apology, Sharon.

38:51.350 --> 38:53.309
I-I-I've... I've crafted
a few in my head.

38:53.334 --> 38:55.863
I've even written some down.
I-I'm just so...

38:55.888 --> 38:59.671
Bert, please, it's fine.

39:00.368 --> 39:01.967
Mr. Goodwin?

39:01.992 --> 39:03.528
You wanted to know when
Lyla was all sewn up?

39:03.553 --> 39:05.343
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

39:10.965 --> 39:12.365
You know what, maybe someday,

39:12.390 --> 39:15.665
I can introduce the two of you formally.

39:17.754 --> 39:20.676
Yeah, sure.

39:32.347 --> 39:35.696
Hey, Nina left this for you earlier.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.319
Oh.

39:38.066 --> 39:40.205
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

39:41.918 --> 39:45.259
So I heard Goodwin's ex
brought his new girlfriend in.

39:45.284 --> 39:48.665
- Yeah, Lyla.
- Oh, that's gotta be tough,

39:48.690 --> 39:51.377
seeing someone you care about
so much with a new lover.

39:51.402 --> 39:54.503
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Hm.

39:57.550 --> 40:01.158
I mean, I was the one treating Lyla.

40:01.434 --> 40:03.455
Right.

40:04.742 --> 40:06.455
Good night.

40:07.452 --> 40:09.285
Good night.

40:13.277 --> 40:16.291
- Good night, Ms. Goodwin.
- Night.

40:17.702 --> 40:19.134
I was gonna get a little drink.

40:19.159 --> 40:20.267
Yes.

40:20.293 --> 40:21.885
You find out who paid the ransom yet?

40:21.910 --> 40:24.783
You know what? I don't care.

40:26.785 --> 40:28.408
Who do we have next?

40:28.433 --> 40:30.211
Two CABGS, back to back.

40:30.236 --> 40:32.263
At least the hybrid suite's back online.

40:32.288 --> 40:33.962
Everyone's wondering
who paid the ransom.

40:33.987 --> 40:35.767
I did.

40:36.181 --> 40:39.416
30 Bitcoin versus the continued
integrity of our services?

40:39.441 --> 40:41.658
Pretty simple math, don't you think?

41:12.853 --> 41:15.966
Uh, honey, what's going on?

41:16.374 --> 41:18.380
Why are you up?

41:23.065 --> 41:26.200
Seriously, who can sleep through that?

41:28.749 --> 41:30.802
- Through what?
- The rats.

41:30.827 --> 41:33.974
My God, it's like nails on a chalkboard.

41:33.999 --> 41:36.716
This... this whole
city must be infested.

41:38.467 --> 41:40.365
Can't you hear them?
