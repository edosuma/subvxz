I've met quite a few interesting

I think Shamus would want
you to keep it.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.460
For all you done for us,
for saving our kind.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.220
Oh, you guys kind of
did that yourselves.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.180
- It was your luck,
after all.
- Aye.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.540
But it was your fighting spirit
that sparked it.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.640
The same spirit Shamus had.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.620
I wish I could accept
that compliment,

38:08.720 --> 38:12.180
but I was just looking
to be reimbursed,
to tell you the truth.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.900
I felt like

38:14.000 --> 38:17.240
- magic owed me.
- And do you still feel
that way?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.900
No. I don't.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.080
Doesn't matter what
brings a person,
only what they leave with.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.920
[CHATTERING]

38:49.000 --> 38:50.220
Hey.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.860
Leo, what are you doing here?
Who's watching Wyatt?

38:52.960 --> 38:54.340
I asked Paige to.
I thought maybe

38:54.440 --> 38:57.180
you and I could spend
some time together alone.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.300
Sounds great,
but it's a little crazy in here.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.100
I can see that.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.100
Pat Benatar definitely
brings in the crowd, huh?

39:03.200 --> 39:05.820
Yeah, at least
I'll go out with a bang.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.900
What do you mean?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.420
Uh...

39:09.520 --> 39:12.300
Well, I've been thinking,

39:12.400 --> 39:14.900
and I've decided
that I wanna sell the club.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.900
Not because I want to,
but I feel like I have to.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.660
I mean, being a mother/
Charmed One/ businesswoman

39:20.760 --> 39:23.940
is just one slash way too many.
Something's gotta give.

39:24.040 --> 39:27.980
But this club is your baby too,
Piper. You can't give it up.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.900
I don't really feel
like I have a choice.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.900
I mean, I've been stretched
pretty thin lately,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.100
and I think we're both
feeling the strain.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.700
Yeah. I know. That's...

39:37.800 --> 39:41.340
- That's why I asked the Elders
for paternity leave.
- Huh?

39:41.440 --> 39:45.260
It's obviously never
been done before.
But they spent time with Wyatt

39:45.360 --> 39:47.140
and realized how important he is

39:47.240 --> 39:49.900
and decided
to break the rules for him.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.300
That's weird. I mean, what
happens to your other charges?

39:52.400 --> 39:53.900
You do have a career too.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.260
We'll, they'll temporarily
reassign them.
Except for you guys.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.980
And as for my career,
it's not as important to me
as we are.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.900
Honey, I don't think
I can let you do this.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
Piper, it's one thing
I don't wanna argue about, okay?

40:13.600 --> 40:17.180
MC: Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Pat Benatar.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.280
[CHEERING]

40:30.280 --> 40:32.560
[SINGING]

41:21.800 --> 41:24.220
You here on business?

41:24.320 --> 41:26.260
Actually, no, I'm not.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.900
- What are you doing here?
- I'm meeting someone.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.900
- Really? Weird, me too.
- I know.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
You're meeting me.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.220
- I don't understand.
- I'm Cyrano73.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.220
In the flesh, so to speak.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.220
Uh...

41:47.320 --> 41:49.140
Wait. Phoebe, let me explain.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.460
Okay. Sure, go ahead.
Give it your best shot.

41:52.560 --> 41:56.040
I just knew you'd never go out
with me if I asked you straight,
right?

41:57.080 --> 41:58.780
Right?

41:58.880 --> 42:01.260
- Right.
- So I had to find a way

42:01.360 --> 42:04.800
to see if you were interested
in me without putting any
pressure on you.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.700
I like you, Phoebe.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.100
I liked you the minute
I laid eyes on you.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.860
And I know you like me.

42:11.960 --> 42:15.160
Or at least the part of me
that brought you here.

42:16.640 --> 42:18.740
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have come.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.140
- Jason, I don't know.
- I'm not asking you
to marry me.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.460
I just...

42:23.560 --> 42:25.020
I just wanna buy you a drink.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.100
Come on,
what have you got to lose?

42:27.200 --> 42:30.140
- Oh, I don't know,
my job maybe?
- That would never happen.

42:30.240 --> 42:34.260
Hey, you want Cyrano
to disappear, he's gone.

42:34.360 --> 42:37.360
I promise.
Just say the word.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.200
Martini, dirty.
