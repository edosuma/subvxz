00:16.950 --> 00:19.487
♫ But you best believe, boy,
there's hell to pay ♫

00:19.553 --> 00:23.457
♫ Yeah, you best believe, boy,
there's hell to pay, saying ♫

00:26.227 --> 00:28.896
♫ Oh, my God,
please help me ♫

00:28.962 --> 00:31.699
♫ Neck-deep in the river
screaming for relief ♫

00:31.765 --> 00:35.002
♫ He says, it's mine to give
but it's yours to choose ♫

00:35.069 --> 00:38.072
♫ You're gonna sink or swim,
you're gonna learn the truth ♫

00:38.139 --> 00:42.176
♫ No matter what do,
you're gonna learn
the truth, saying ♫

00:42.243 --> 00:45.012
♫ Ate the bread

00:45.079 --> 00:48.616
♫ Fell from a cliff,
never broke a bone ♫

00:48.682 --> 00:50.984
♫ Bowed down to get
the kings overthrown ♫

00:51.051 --> 00:54.455
♫ And I'm all alone

00:54.522 --> 00:58.326
♫ And I'm all alone
and the fire grows ♫

01:44.505 --> 01:45.539
Ohh.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.378
Time to go, Donald.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.352
You know how I feel
about travel.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.254
I hope you find
the trip worth it.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.356
Well, if I'm going to be
handling the case,

03:08.422 --> 03:11.024
I think I'm entitled
to a few answers.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.261
I'm sure you do feel entitled.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.896
Everyone else seems to nowadays.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.300
All right.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.501
I can't promise you anything.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.768
But it'll help, right?

03:54.835 --> 03:56.404
Maybe, but I don't
want you suing me

03:56.470 --> 03:57.671
if it doesn't work.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.707
All right, just give me
the fucking waiver.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.313
Here we go.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.381
So we're clear,
my recommendation is

04:07.448 --> 04:08.916
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.217
But it's not a cure.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.795
You'll still have the apnea,
ablation.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.721
It'll just open you up
a little bit.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.565
Okay, just so you know,
you're not putting me under.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.890
Just do whatever a dentist does.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.327
I want to be awake
for this shit, you know?

04:19.360 --> 04:20.494
Let me ask you something.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.330
If a guy was talking
to you about suicide

04:23.331 --> 04:24.774
when you were working
on him or whatever,

04:24.798 --> 04:27.034
would you put that in your file?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.669
Are you thinking of suicide?

04:28.736 --> 04:31.238
Why would I think of suicide?

04:31.339 --> 04:34.141
Have you taken a look
at yourself?

04:34.207 --> 04:35.443
No. I'm not
committing suicide.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.210
It's for a case
that I'm working on.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.547
Okay. Yeah.
I'd put it in my file

04:39.613 --> 04:41.348
along with a note saying
you should go see a shrink

04:41.349 --> 04:42.916
and get on Zoloft.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.420
Come on.
While we're young.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.379
Don't give me that look,
Leonard.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.081
This is your big chance.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.347
Go in there and show everybody

05:15.383 --> 05:16.383
what you're capable of.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.385
You're not staying?

05:17.451 --> 05:19.386
Not my department, son.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.955
Now, lying to other lawyers?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.391
That's your job.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.059
You should have told me
what was going on, Wendell...

05:26.126 --> 05:27.828
why we couldn't settle.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.432
Hey, I shouldn't have
had to tell you.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.434
Cooperman told you.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.405
Just answer all
of her questions.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.417
Collateral damage.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.018
Dead civilians.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.121
I saw it myself
when I served over there.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.823
Every time we killed a kid,

05:55.889 --> 05:58.959
we turned a hundred
of them against us.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.428
Ryan Larson was working

06:00.494 --> 06:02.429
to stop this sort of thing
from happening.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.432
Turn it off, please.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.069
Why are you showing me this?

06:09.136 --> 06:10.504
Why do you even have this?

06:10.571 --> 06:12.740
Do you know how bad
this would look to a jury?

06:12.806 --> 06:16.343
That you collect
this battlefield porn?

06:16.444 --> 06:18.211
It's R&D.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.847
It is standard industry practice

06:19.913 --> 06:22.149
to maintain a library
of all products in use

06:22.215 --> 06:23.851
and negligent not to.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.219
Ryan studied these
to help figure out

06:26.286 --> 06:27.488
how to save innocent lives.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.257
Really? With a new
weapons system?

06:30.323 --> 06:31.592
The weapons are fine.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.661
The problem is
getting them on site.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.596
By the time we know
where the bad guys are

06:35.663 --> 06:37.064
and get all the
necessary approvals

06:37.130 --> 06:38.331
to fire the missiles,

06:38.466 --> 06:39.476
the bad guys have
left the building.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.601
Justice delayed.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.836
Exactly.
And Ryan was developing

06:42.903 --> 06:45.238
a new fuel system
to cut down delay,

06:45.305 --> 06:46.774
get the bombs there faster.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.344
So he was testing
military grade fuel

06:51.479 --> 06:52.646
on the boat.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.515
That's what you're telling me?

06:54.582 --> 06:57.485
Because if that's true,
you're fucked.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.486
Open sea testing is illegal.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.489
He was not doing tests.

07:01.522 --> 07:05.493
The only reason
he was out there was suicide.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.995
Work stress, marriage issues.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.730
The man was unstable,

07:09.797 --> 07:12.600
and he used the fuel he was
testing to kill himself.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.903
Then why not tell McBride
and the widow all this?

07:17.404 --> 07:18.606
We never got federal approval

07:18.672 --> 07:19.940
to test the fuel.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.375
The Pentagon
has been hammering us

07:22.510 --> 07:23.544
to fix the delay issue,

07:23.611 --> 07:25.078
but if we followed their rules,

07:25.145 --> 07:27.280
it would take us ten years
before we got to market.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.150
And by then we might have
lost the contract.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.719
Better to beg for forgiveness

07:31.785 --> 07:33.954
than ask for commission.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.188
We're DOD contractors.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.690
By law we're required

07:36.757 --> 07:38.637
to report all legal
settlements to the Pentagon,

07:38.692 --> 07:41.028
which means admitting
we broke the law.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.831
They would shut down
our fuel research,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.332
or the Department
of Energy would.

07:45.398 --> 07:48.101
So why the fuck were you
trying to settle in chambers?

07:48.168 --> 07:52.105
As all this happened
before I started here,

07:52.172 --> 07:53.340
I didn't know anything

07:53.406 --> 07:55.308
about what Ryan was working on

07:55.375 --> 07:56.443
until today.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.178
You're general counsel.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.180
Leonard didn't need to know

08:02.382 --> 08:04.017
because I knew.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.253
Maybe next time,

08:06.319 --> 08:08.989
you'll heed my advice.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.829
Talk about sandbagged.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.398
I almost felt sorry for him.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.900
Don't.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.435
Corporations
keep general counsels

08:22.570 --> 08:23.647
in order to have
someone to blame

08:23.671 --> 08:24.938
if things go badly.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.610
Leonard is a highly
paid scapegoat.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.613
Are you satisfied?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.582
Have all your questions
been answered,

08:35.616 --> 08:37.585
all your doubts assuaged?

08:37.618 --> 08:39.052
Don't get mad at me

08:39.119 --> 08:42.322
for wanting to know
the facts of my own case.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.825
That's my job.
It's why you pay me.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.661
Doesn't answer my question.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.898
I'm not sure.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.833
As you said, it's not unusual

08:52.900 --> 08:55.736
for big corporations
to keep things
from their lawyers.

09:01.508 --> 09:04.044
Obviously, Leonard was upset...

09:05.145 --> 09:06.647
humiliated.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.617
So I guess I'm
partially satisfied.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.953
Partially.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.625
Come home with me.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.627
I want to fuck you.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.963
I think I'm entitled.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.138
You're not entitled to shit.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.974
You never were.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.658
Oh, good.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.426
Good. Smoking after
surgery. That's smart.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.795
I didn't have the surgery.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.463
He cranked up
that fucking machine

09:56.529 --> 09:57.765
and scared the shit out of me,

09:57.831 --> 09:59.366
- and I chickened out.
- Whatever.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.436
I got the...
I got the prosecutor

10:03.503 --> 10:05.272
to knock down your DUI

10:05.338 --> 10:08.008
to a misdemeanor
and impaired driving.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.843
And, uh, and they're
going to drop

10:09.910 --> 10:11.779
the resisting arrest, too, so...

10:11.845 --> 10:13.246
I'm not going to plead guilty.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.948
Yes, you are, man.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.249
I'm done.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.687
You want to risk going to jail

10:19.753 --> 10:22.589
to prove something
that you can't ever prove.

10:22.656 --> 10:23.924
And then what?

10:23.991 --> 10:25.458
What, you're going to leave me

10:25.525 --> 10:27.236
holding a big bag of shit
from the Larson case?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.962
I said I'm not fucking
pleading guilty.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.731
I already told you
that before, okay?

10:30.798 --> 10:32.265
- Okay.
- God damn it.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.400
What the fuck?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.268
You do one good thing.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.904
You get us past summary
judgment,

10:36.970 --> 10:38.782
and you convince the judge
that we have a case.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.007
And that's great.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.641
But then you turn around,

10:41.709 --> 10:43.310
and you immediately fuck it up.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.779
I mean, what is that?
Why? Why do you do that?

10:45.846 --> 10:47.480
Could we please fucking go?

10:47.547 --> 10:49.349
Could you start the fucking car?

10:49.416 --> 10:52.119
$500,000!

10:52.185 --> 10:55.322
Do you know
how much money that is?

10:55.388 --> 10:57.424
Do you understand that?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.626
And you turn it down

10:59.727 --> 11:01.762
without even asking the client,

11:01.829 --> 11:03.730
without even asking me.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.132
It's my case.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.268
I brought you on to settle this,

11:08.335 --> 11:11.438
not to drag it out for
some personal agenda.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.906
And for what?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.809
You want to what, prove
something to Cooperman?

11:15.876 --> 11:18.111
You want to prove
something to yourself.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.512
It doesn't matter!

11:19.579 --> 11:20.848
Nobody cares!

11:20.914 --> 11:22.783
And it doesn't fucking matter

11:22.850 --> 11:24.151
because, at the end of the day,

11:24.217 --> 11:26.753
they're big and we're little.

11:26.754 --> 11:27.921
And they're going to kill us,

11:27.988 --> 11:30.157
and I am terrified.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.626
I am terrified,
do you understand that?

12:02.890 --> 12:04.858
How did you know
I needed you tonight?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.526
Are you a fucking psychic?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.629
A little cold out tonight, baby?

12:09.696 --> 12:11.799
All right. Come on.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.201
Just don't make a habit
out of it, though.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.948
She was due in court
at that time...

12:28.015 --> 12:29.449
- Ahem.
- Let me check.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.783
She does have an opening in...

12:31.819 --> 12:33.053
What the fuck?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.088
Callie.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.157
Sorry. Donald asked us
to make sure

12:37.224 --> 12:38.959
- that the discovery...
- Donald?

12:39.026 --> 12:42.062
You're on a first name basis
with Mr. Cooperman now?

12:42.129 --> 12:42.830
No.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.664
Fuck off.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.133
Sorry.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.168
I don't know who
you think you are,

12:48.235 --> 12:51.704
but you don't come in my
office without my permission.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.206
But there's a discovery hearing

12:53.273 --> 12:55.142
- later this afternoon, and...
- Get out.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.210
A lot of...

12:57.277 --> 12:58.211
I'm sorry.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.622
I didn't mean
to overstep my bounds.

12:59.646 --> 13:00.580
I just...

13:00.647 --> 13:01.882
- Get out!
- Sorry.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.059
Donald Cooperman's office.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.526
Let me speak to Donald.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.895
He's not in.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.629
Fuck you. He's always in.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.465
Put him on, Nicole.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.168
He's not in.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.873
Therefore, I must by law

13:26.874 --> 13:29.076
allow this lawsuit to proceed.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.744
Mr. McBride
has filed for

13:31.879 --> 13:33.646
a number of discovery requests

13:33.713 --> 13:36.883
and moved for an expedited
discovery schedule.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.551
Well, obviously,
we'll need a few months

13:38.618 --> 13:39.818
to comply with those requests.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.421
No, you don't.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.023
A client like Borns Tech

13:43.090 --> 13:44.491
has most files online already.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.893
We don't, actually.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.403
And the ones that aren't
are in a warehouse.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.561
But that's okay.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.628
They got a system.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.131
I know.
I designed it.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.166
They put the files
on a plane to India,

13:53.233 --> 13:54.601
where they got
a bunch of guys...

13:54.667 --> 13:56.003
or kids, for all I know...

13:56.069 --> 13:57.370
scanning each piece of paper

13:57.437 --> 13:58.905
through hundreds of machines

13:58.906 --> 14:00.908
24 hours a day
seven days a week.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.310
What used to take about
two years for discovery

14:03.376 --> 14:05.045
takes them about a week now.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.747
They can scan millions
of documents in a few seconds.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.049
We can't do that.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.051
We don't have the people
or the computers

14:11.118 --> 14:12.519
or their algorithms.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.820
We got sweat labor.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.055
Fine. We'll agree

14:15.122 --> 14:16.924
to the expedited
discovery process.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.258
We don't want this case delayed.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.927
We'll deliver the discovery
to them next week.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.729
In return,
I ask that Mr. McBride

14:22.795 --> 14:24.731
names his anonymous
whistle blower

14:24.797 --> 14:26.599
so that we can
investigate who it is

14:26.666 --> 14:28.568
and schedule his deposition.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.303
- No.
- Excuse me?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.340
Well, since our initial client
Rachel Kennedy was killed,

14:33.406 --> 14:35.308
we're afraid
that our witnesses
may be in danger.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.678
Objection.
It is slander to suggest

14:38.745 --> 14:41.081
that a corporation
such as Borns Technology

14:41.148 --> 14:43.383
could have been involved
in Rachel Kennedy's death,

14:43.450 --> 14:45.585
and I ask that Mr. McBride
be sanctioned.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.688
By the way, allegations
in court are not slander.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.958
Say them outside
the courtroom,
and they will be.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.493
And we will not hesitate to sue.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.062
- Ohh.
- Okay.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.131
Mr. McBride,
you got a choice:

14:58.198 --> 15:00.533
to name all your eyewitnesses

15:00.600 --> 15:02.970
or back up your
allegations of danger.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.272
Fine, as long as
the court's on notice

15:05.338 --> 15:07.674
and they're on notice
not to do anything
to our people.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.176
Notice of what?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.244
What... What exactly
is he implying?

15:11.311 --> 15:13.313
Or doesn't he have
the balls to say it?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.114
Hoo hoo hoo!

15:14.181 --> 15:15.648
Hey. Hey, you.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.985
Sit down.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.454
Now.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.509
You want to explain that?

15:44.544 --> 15:48.348
I just thought that
Mr. McBride was out of...

15:48.415 --> 15:52.019
Was out of line
and that I should
call him on it.

15:52.085 --> 15:55.322
You back-doored me
to Cooperman.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.623
N-No.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.458
Not... It's...

15:58.525 --> 15:59.659
Spit it out.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.564
Fine. He emailed me
last night,

16:04.631 --> 16:06.033
and he told me...

16:07.034 --> 16:08.368
that if Mr. McBride

16:08.435 --> 16:11.304
brought up Rachel Kennedy,
I should hit back with...

16:11.371 --> 16:14.040
He told you to speak?

16:14.041 --> 16:15.475
Really?

16:17.277 --> 16:18.478
Yeah.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.680
He did.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.318
I'm sorry. Didn't you
get the email, too?

16:26.819 --> 16:27.920
Huh.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.723
That's odd, isn't it?

16:37.464 --> 16:39.499
So other than
the Charger tickets,

16:39.566 --> 16:41.968
did you guys have anything
else planned to do?

16:42.069 --> 16:43.636
Everything.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.138
ComicCon, fishing,

16:45.205 --> 16:47.207
he was teaching me to play golf.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.878
He ever seem depressed to you?

16:51.944 --> 16:53.880
No.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.282
Honey...

16:55.348 --> 16:57.217
No. I'm sorry,
Mrs. Larson.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.419
You can be here,
but you can't really talk.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.090
I'm sorry. That's...

17:03.123 --> 17:04.457
Dad wasn't depressed
with me, Mom.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.493
You guys fought,
but Dad and I were fine.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.098
In fact, most of the time,
he was really happy.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.769
Did he ever talk
about his work with you?

17:16.836 --> 17:19.872
Not much. Just that...

17:19.939 --> 17:21.473
he didn't like
the project he was on.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.009
Did he say why?

17:23.109 --> 17:26.313
Just that, whatever it was,
it was taking too long.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.128
That's enough for today.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.463
Come on. Come in.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.531
Come inside.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.676
I'm sure Rachel
never mentioned it,

17:56.743 --> 18:00.947
but I found this in
Ryan's desk after he died.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.882
Go ahead. You can...

18:02.949 --> 18:04.417
You can read it.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.521
That's my husband's
suicide note.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.502
Fuck me.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.074
This is going to bury us.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.177
Not necessarily.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.179
Look, she found the letter
after he died.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.946
If she'd found it
before he died,

18:34.013 --> 18:35.582
then he could have
just come across

18:35.648 --> 18:37.284
as a guy who's
pissed off about work

18:37.350 --> 18:39.652
and he's blowing off steam,

18:39.719 --> 18:42.422
not like some guy who's
going to blow himself up.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.624
Sometimes people want
to cover their ass.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.259
They want to get
something in the file

18:46.326 --> 18:47.526
that says that they're against

18:47.560 --> 18:49.496
whatever bad shit
the company's up to.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.531
Well, in any case, we're
going to have to prove

18:51.598 --> 18:53.233
that this isn't
a suicide letter.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.402
Oh, I got some leads on that.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.042
You did well at the hearing.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.212
I'm glad to hear you say that.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.248
I was starting to think
you'd lost faith in me

19:08.315 --> 19:09.616
for some reason.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.320
Why would you think that?

19:13.386 --> 19:14.587
I don't know.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.425
Free-floating anxiety.

19:18.491 --> 19:22.362
It wasn't because I reached out
to Lucy Kittridge, was it?

19:25.565 --> 19:26.666
Why did you?

19:26.733 --> 19:28.000
She's aggressive,

19:28.067 --> 19:30.503
hungry, young.

19:30.570 --> 19:34.841
All things you... used to be.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.547
There's no need
to test me, Donald.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.548
You're right.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.450
You're still hungry
and aggressive.

19:43.516 --> 19:47.119
Experience has made you wise.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.256
And curious.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.790
I hope that it has.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.726
You're so curious
about Ryan Larson

19:53.793 --> 19:57.864
that you made me
watch Leonard Letts'
dog and pony show.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.834
The young are not wise enough

20:01.901 --> 20:04.103
to be curious,

20:04.170 --> 20:07.173
- ask questions.
- Mm.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.776
Is that the reason for Lucy?

20:09.842 --> 20:12.312
You want someone
you can keep in the dark?

20:12.379 --> 20:14.414
I do like the dark.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.555
Billy will turn this
into David and Goliath.

20:22.622 --> 20:26.125
Solo practitioner
fighting for justice

20:26.192 --> 20:30.530
against the big giant law firm
and a weapons manufacturer.

20:33.300 --> 20:37.270
Lucy is an innocent little girl.

20:38.605 --> 20:44.377
A small, delicate little flower.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.052
Lucy Kittridge
is now first chair

20:53.119 --> 20:54.821
on the Borns Tech case.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.858
You cannot be serious.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.863
She's a kid.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.479
Fuck.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.786
How long is this going to take?

21:26.853 --> 21:29.556
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Ask me another question.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.190
All right, Ned.
Tell me again

21:31.257 --> 21:33.893
what exactly did Ryan Larson do?

21:33.960 --> 21:37.263
I already told you
I didn't know him very well,

21:37.364 --> 21:39.466
although I did know
that Ryan's team worked

21:39.532 --> 21:41.701
in an entirely
different department

21:41.768 --> 21:45.772
and that they were...
smart but not super-smart.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.475
They all wanted to be
rocket men like me,

21:48.541 --> 21:51.110
but they didn't have it.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.112
Hmm. It?

21:53.179 --> 21:55.382
I'm not sure
that you'd understand.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.651
An engineering pedigree.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.887
- Mm.
- Strong math background,

22:00.953 --> 22:05.992
creator gene,
and something that's...

22:06.058 --> 22:07.226
ineffable...

22:07.293 --> 22:11.731
you know, bigness,
courage, and clarity.

22:11.798 --> 22:12.798
Genius.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.101
And you had it?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.937
I was the smartest engineer
in that entire place.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.139
That's why I worked
the ballistic missile team.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.908
And Ryan worked on bombs?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.643
Munitions.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.178
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you

22:26.245 --> 22:27.514
we don't call them bombs.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.148
Motherfucker,
you called them bombs

22:29.215 --> 22:31.484
the first time that we met you.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.619
What did he say?

22:32.685 --> 22:34.554
What did you say?
Rocket ass-bombs?

22:34.621 --> 22:36.188
- I don't...
- I never said that.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.157
Okay, Ned, you cannot lie.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.325
I don't lie. I never lie.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.127
And you can't snap at people

22:41.193 --> 22:42.662
during the deposition.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.831
If I'm annoyed,
I'm going to let them know.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.933
No, you're not. You're
going to answer politely

22:46.999 --> 22:48.200
and calmly.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.969
This... This...
Right here, this...

22:50.036 --> 22:51.604
this is highly unethical.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.311
- What is?
- You telling me what to think,

22:53.440 --> 22:54.941
making me say things.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.277
Nobody is making you
say or do anything.

22:58.344 --> 22:59.646
This... This is boring.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.448
This is boring.
I am bored.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.582
- Ned...
- I am bored.

23:02.649 --> 23:03.716
- Please.
- This is boring.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.284
- This is boring.
- Please,

23:05.351 --> 23:06.686
we're just trying to prepare you

23:06.753 --> 23:09.722
for a deposition.
Okay?

23:09.789 --> 23:12.158
I want a third of whatever
you're getting.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.560
What?

23:13.626 --> 23:15.227
This is turning out
to be a lot more work

23:15.294 --> 23:17.764
and... and inconvenience
than I had originally expected,

23:17.830 --> 23:20.466
so I want to be
compensated financially.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.902
Okay, we can't do that
because if we did that,

23:22.969 --> 23:24.937
you'd have no credibility
with the jury.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.206
- Fine.
- Also, it is illegal.

23:27.273 --> 23:28.675
So...

23:28.741 --> 23:30.109
You're a fucking bitch.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.078
Okay, I mean, I can't...

23:32.144 --> 23:33.212
All right, Ned, listen.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.914
Listen.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.484
Let me explain something
to you, buddy.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.251
If you talk to her
that way again,

23:39.318 --> 23:41.754
I'll beat your fucking ass
right here in your own house.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.656
- She was...
- I don't care what she said.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.324
- I have...
- Listen to me.

23:45.391 --> 23:49.061
Ned. Don't make me
beat your ass.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.499
All right now.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.735
This plastic shit here.

23:55.802 --> 23:59.238
Now, Marquez' boys say
it rained down on their boat

23:59.305 --> 24:00.973
right after the explosion.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.409
I want you to tell me

24:03.510 --> 24:05.177
exactly what this stuff is

24:05.244 --> 24:07.179
and exactly what its use is.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.216
It's ignition casing

24:10.282 --> 24:13.520
for a highly classified
experimental fuel system

24:13.553 --> 24:15.588
for drones to deliver
massive munitions.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.056
Ah, but you said

24:17.123 --> 24:19.125
that Ryan Larson didn't
have what it takes

24:19.191 --> 24:20.560
to work on missiles.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.571
Drones are not missiles,
you stupid fucking bitch.

24:22.595 --> 24:23.796
- I'm done.
- They're toys.

24:23.863 --> 24:26.265
Anything that she can
buy at Wal-mart

24:26.332 --> 24:27.567
doesn't count as a missile.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.536
Ned, what did I just get
through saying to you?

24:30.537 --> 24:32.972
I'm sorry, but she asks
stupid questions, and...

24:33.039 --> 24:37.276
Ned, she's asking you
the same stupid questions

24:37.343 --> 24:38.578
that they're going to ask you.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.012
Don't you get the point here?

24:40.079 --> 24:42.815
She's just doing her job,
that's all.

24:42.882 --> 24:43.883
Yeah.

24:46.553 --> 24:47.720
Now...

24:49.722 --> 24:51.123
tell me about it.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.062
Ryan's team worked
on a fuel system

24:56.128 --> 24:57.363
for Borns Tech.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.799
It's a very unstable,

24:59.866 --> 25:01.233
very dangerous fuel,

25:01.300 --> 25:04.637
the use of which...
the testing of which

25:04.704 --> 25:07.740
is banned by U.S.
and international law.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.942
Can you test it on the ocean?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.010
Legally?

25:12.244 --> 25:13.980
You can't test it at all.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.885
She's 26 years old.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.888
First chair. He's got
to be fucking kidding me.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.591
- It's ridiculous.
- Cooperman has lost it.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.093
I mean, he was never
right to begin with,

25:27.159 --> 25:28.895
but now he's insane.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.062
Okay.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.597
Please explain to me

25:31.598 --> 25:33.600
what happened on the boat.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.002
Uh, you don't want to know.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.938
No, actually, I do want to know.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.440
If Donald's being this crazy,

25:41.507 --> 25:44.176
I want to know why.
I'm a partner.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.614
We all have financial
stakes in this, so...

25:50.249 --> 25:51.517
Ah.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.152
You're afraid
I'm going to tell Billy.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.655
That's incredibly insulting.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.757
Well, you still love him,

25:57.824 --> 26:00.292
even though he's always
been a shit to you.

26:00.359 --> 26:01.961
Oh ho ho ho.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.864
I'm civil to him for
the sake of our daughter.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.432
Really? How's that going?

26:06.498 --> 26:07.810
Because last I heard,
she couldn't stand

26:07.834 --> 26:09.736
to be in the same room as you.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.338
Why would you say
something like that?

26:17.343 --> 26:18.645
Sorry.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.515
We should have
left here years ago

26:23.650 --> 26:25.351
and started our firm.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.962
- We still could.
- Stop it. You know what?

26:26.986 --> 26:28.387
You always bring this up

26:28.454 --> 26:29.732
whenever you're
being a shit to me.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.290
We're never
starting our own firm.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.764
Well, if you do
still care about him,

26:37.830 --> 26:40.199
you should tell him
to drop the case.

26:43.002 --> 26:46.672
- Bounced? Really?
- Yes, ma'am.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.174
Can you give me a week?

26:48.240 --> 26:49.341
Mm, no.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.509
Three days?

26:50.576 --> 26:51.577
Can't do it.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.713
One day.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.114
Sorry.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.249
Hello?

27:14.200 --> 27:15.702
Aw, shit.

27:19.505 --> 27:20.807
- Miss Gold?
- Mm-hmm.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.308
These gentlemen
will help you move.

27:22.374 --> 27:23.374
Mm.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.714
Come on in.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.020
Perfect timing.

27:43.629 --> 27:45.732
- What's going on?
- Let's go.

27:53.372 --> 27:54.372
Good trip?

27:55.641 --> 27:57.376
All I want to hear from you

27:57.443 --> 27:59.411
is we're all going to get
this shit out of here.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.015
Any issues?

28:03.082 --> 28:05.785
No. Everything
went real smooth.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.553
Put the shit
in the hull insulation.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.421
When?

28:11.423 --> 28:12.759
Soon.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.328
What did I tell you
about keeping this quiet?

28:16.395 --> 28:18.530
I didn't tell nobody.

28:18.597 --> 28:19.832
What about your lawyer?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.768
He's not our fucking lawyer.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.069
You called him.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.372
You went to his office.

28:26.438 --> 28:27.639
I told you, we're witnesses

28:27.774 --> 28:30.109
in this bullshit insurance case.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.410
Hold on.

28:33.145 --> 28:36.282
How do you know
we talked to him? Hmm?

28:36.348 --> 28:37.616
You following us?

28:37.683 --> 28:40.019
You bugging our phones,
you fuck?

28:41.020 --> 28:42.788
It's like anything else.

28:42.789 --> 28:45.825
You got to know
who's on your team.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.560
I like to keep a tab
on my partners.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.029
Don't you?

28:51.898 --> 28:54.633
No. All I want to know

28:54.700 --> 28:57.303
is when we're going to get
this shit off my boat.

28:59.605 --> 29:00.873
Soon.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.410
Very soon.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.822
Lead counsel?

29:15.855 --> 29:18.590
I started three months
before you.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.893
I... It's just
for this one case.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.394
For our biggest client.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.530
Exactly, which is why
I need your help.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.831
Mr. Cooperman asked me

29:25.832 --> 29:28.234
to prepare all
the discovery responses.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.836
For real? I... Are you
sure about this?

29:30.837 --> 29:33.372
Do you want to read
the emails again?

29:34.907 --> 29:36.042
Please, can we get started?

29:36.108 --> 29:37.476
There is so much work to do.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.544
I can't.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.946
I have work conflicts.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.252
Yeah. I'm booked up,
too. Sorry.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.582
Wait. What?
I need your help.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.417
Okay?

29:45.484 --> 29:47.119
What is the issue?

29:48.254 --> 29:49.388
Oh.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.894
You guys are afraid
of alienating Callie.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.697
I'll tell Mr. Cooperman
you weren't being helpful.

29:58.764 --> 30:01.367
Oh, you and Cooperman
talk a lot?

30:01.433 --> 30:03.102
In person?

30:03.169 --> 30:04.736
You haven't even met him.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.672
I'm in contact.

30:06.738 --> 30:08.107
If you don't help me,

30:08.174 --> 30:09.375
I'll make sure you pay for it.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.544
- Ha ha.
- You think I'm
fucking kidding?

30:12.611 --> 30:14.413
This is...

30:14.480 --> 30:15.848
This is my career here.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.349
Fuck you, Lucy.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.192
How can I help?

30:26.258 --> 30:28.160
Thank you.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.863
Just make sure
Mr. Cooperman knows.

30:31.797 --> 30:33.165
Start there.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.626
Oh, you're here?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.328
Damn it.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.629
I love you, too.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.366
I was going
to bring a friend up.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.001
You can't afford your own room?

31:09.068 --> 31:10.669
What are you, broke?

31:10.736 --> 31:12.438
A little bit, yeah.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.543
So you we're
going to use my room?

31:17.609 --> 31:18.610
Your office.

31:18.677 --> 31:19.677
What...

31:19.711 --> 31:21.080
I thought you'd be out.

31:21.147 --> 31:23.515
Come on. I don't do it
that often.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.716
Yeah, but, honey, my office?

31:24.783 --> 31:26.794
Seriously, what kind of
freaky shit you got planned?

31:26.818 --> 31:30.289
No, we... He enjoys the whole
office scenario, all right?

31:30.356 --> 31:32.824
He's like... He's
like a CEO up north...

31:32.959 --> 31:35.227
uh, Silicon Valley.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.965
- Hi tech.
- Bullshit.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.570
Are you using again?

31:47.306 --> 31:48.107
No.

31:48.174 --> 31:49.408
Are you using again?

31:49.475 --> 31:50.475
No.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.611
No.

31:59.818 --> 32:01.687
Make it the last time, okay?

32:01.753 --> 32:02.821
Thank you.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.456
We're representing a kid now.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.992
We got to maintain
some standards.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.394
- All right.
- And by the way,

32:08.460 --> 32:09.461
you're depressed.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.297
I'm fine.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.398
No.

32:12.464 --> 32:15.534
You're really fucking depressed.

32:27.913 --> 32:29.448
Uh, Father?

32:32.784 --> 32:34.553
- Yes.
- Is that puke?

32:36.688 --> 32:38.390
How may I help you?

32:41.693 --> 32:43.028
I don't want to bother you.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.730
I was just wondering
if maybe you, uh,

32:44.796 --> 32:46.432
had a minute to talk to me.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.702
Yes. Of course.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.204
Great.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.840
- Now?
- Yeah.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.042
Right this way.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.286
You have to clean
this whole place?

32:58.310 --> 32:59.911
Sometimes. No,
we usually have help.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.047
Really?

33:01.080 --> 33:02.448
Everyone takes Sunday off.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.049
And I'd love
to take the day also...

33:04.050 --> 33:05.251
- Uh-huh.
- You know.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.119
- You understand.
- Yeah, of course.

33:08.387 --> 33:13.125
I have done so many things
for money, Father.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.530
I've done things
I can't even say out loud.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.170
I can't even look
at myself anymore.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.340
I thought being here
would help, but...

33:30.742 --> 33:32.744
I hurt all the time.

33:37.083 --> 33:39.551
I don't think
I can do it anymore.

33:40.886 --> 33:42.454
Do what?

33:43.955 --> 33:45.524
Live.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.628
I want to die, Father.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.433
Last night I tried
to kill myself.

33:57.669 --> 33:58.737
Best...

34:02.141 --> 34:05.611
understand you are not alone.

34:09.248 --> 34:13.119
You and I, we will
get you through this,

34:13.152 --> 34:15.286
together with God.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.556
But I've already prayed so much.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.123
Yes.

34:19.125 --> 34:22.328
But sometimes even
our prayers are not enough.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.864
God has given us
signs and resources

34:25.931 --> 34:27.132
to help us.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.436
- You have an email address?
- Yes.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.641
I will make
an appointment for you

34:35.706 --> 34:37.909
with Dr. James Wallace.

34:37.976 --> 34:39.678
After Dr. Wallace sees you,

34:39.745 --> 34:42.614
he'll prescribe medicine
and work with you.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.016
In the meantime,
I can forward you a list

34:45.150 --> 34:47.319
of some excellent websites
and support groups

34:47.386 --> 34:48.954
that have done wonderful work

34:49.020 --> 34:50.856
with people in your
same situation.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.292
Believe me...

34:54.360 --> 34:56.527
God's plan
is not for you to die.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.631
He loves you enough
to forgive anything.

34:59.698 --> 35:04.336
I am here for you
24 hours a day.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.339
Don't hesitate to call.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.649
What in the...

35:23.389 --> 35:27.193
What in the shit is going on?

35:27.259 --> 35:29.595
What in the shit is this?

35:29.661 --> 35:31.863
You said it would all
be on a thumb drive.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.799
Well, they decided
to cornhole us

35:33.865 --> 35:35.200
and give us all the paper.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.502
Oh, great. Okay.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.370
I got a storage locker
out in the Valley.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.306
I got to go to the old
house and get the key.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.708
So I'll check you guys later.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.344
You got to get that shit
upstairs, okay?

35:47.513 --> 35:49.681
I mean, I can get the key.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.521
Billy, I can...
I can get the key.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.090
To the locker. Fuck.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.459
All right.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.830
Hey, eye on
the prize, all right?

36:11.303 --> 36:13.339
Fuck my life.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.742
Oh, my God.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.247
I mean, look at this place.

36:22.248 --> 36:24.350
How does this even
happen to a person?

36:24.416 --> 36:27.286
A little booze, a little weed.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.887
What really happened to Billy

36:28.954 --> 36:30.556
was Sonny Wayne Bender.

36:30.622 --> 36:31.790
Who?

36:33.459 --> 36:34.736
Billy had never done
a murder case.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.329
- Uh-huh.
- It was on his bucket list.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.130
He did too good of a job.

36:39.265 --> 36:41.433
Got the case dismissed
pre-trial.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.436
Bad search. Never even
got close to a jury.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.839
Thing is,
about a year or so later,

36:47.906 --> 36:50.876
Bender took out an entire
family during a home invasion.

36:50.942 --> 36:51.977
What?

36:52.043 --> 36:53.812
Including three little kids.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.414
Ohh.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.516
How did I not know this?

36:57.583 --> 36:59.451
Thanks to Donald Cooperman.

36:59.518 --> 37:02.488
Since Billy got the case
dismissed pre-trial,

37:02.554 --> 37:03.665
nobody knew he was involved.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.824
All right?
Cooperman made sure of it.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.327
He didn't want the publicity
for the firm.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.362
Not exactly a plus
for corporate clients.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.297
So Billy blames himself.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.766
His drinking got a lot worse.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.568
Michelle left,

37:16.635 --> 37:18.437
and that's
when the bottom fell out.

37:18.504 --> 37:21.907
Cooperman broomed him
after he went to shit.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.476
Huh.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.847
So wait. So then how
did you and Billy hook up?

37:32.451 --> 37:34.486
What? Did he represent you
or something, or...

37:34.553 --> 37:36.622
Story time's over, bitch.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.168
This is bullshit.

37:50.235 --> 37:51.403
I'm gonna leave.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.738
They're not coming tonight.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.939
No. He said wait.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.574
I don't give a shit.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.142
The guy's a fucking ghost.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.344
I don't like him.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.011
I want this shit off my boat

38:00.078 --> 38:02.147
tomorrow at the latest.
You tell him.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.582
Why are you being like this?

38:03.649 --> 38:05.351
All right, this is a good thing.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.218
We just have to wait.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.855
Gabriel, this is fucked up.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.190
I got to drive up
to El Monte by 10 or...

38:14.560 --> 38:16.094
You hear that?

38:16.161 --> 38:17.262
What the fuck was that?

38:17.363 --> 38:18.497
Hang on.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.771
Get against the wall!

38:27.272 --> 38:29.274
Gabriel! Gabriel! Gabriel!

38:29.375 --> 38:31.276
I don't fucking know him.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.614
...for our subjects
in custody.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.854
It's me again. Where the hell
are you anyway?

38:42.921 --> 38:43.955
Denise is not home,

38:44.022 --> 38:46.191
and I got to get the key
to the storage locker.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.493
So here's what I'm gonna do.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.760
I'm gonna check the back door.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.395
Everything else was locked up.

38:50.396 --> 38:51.663
If the back door's locked,

38:51.730 --> 38:53.231
I'm gonna stick around
a little bit.

38:53.298 --> 38:54.800
Call me back, okay?

39:17.222 --> 39:18.724
Mmm.

39:28.834 --> 39:32.571
Denise? Get your ass
out here right now.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.907
And bring that little
prick with you. Now!

39:35.974 --> 39:38.710
- What the fuck?
- What are you doing?

39:38.777 --> 39:40.679
What the fuck are you doing?

39:40.746 --> 39:42.814
What does it look
like I'm doing?

39:42.881 --> 39:44.950
I've been calling you.
Where's Denise?

39:45.016 --> 39:47.486
I got to get my key,
the storage key.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.287
I've been calling you.

39:49.354 --> 39:51.289
I've called you
a million fucking times.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.958
I need to get my key.

39:54.426 --> 39:57.028
Oh, my fucking God.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.632
Jesus Christ. Wow.

40:00.699 --> 40:01.699
Ohh!

40:04.035 --> 40:05.871
Motherfucker.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.079
Tough day?

40:15.146 --> 40:16.548
Yeah, a little bit.

40:23.489 --> 40:24.756
Um...

40:28.494 --> 40:30.261
we're all still up there
moving boxes,

40:30.328 --> 40:31.539
and we can use
a little bit of help.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.665
Yeah, well, I'm down here.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.336
What's going on?

40:38.403 --> 40:39.538
Nothing.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.575
Just sitting here.

40:45.811 --> 40:46.811
Okay.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.981
Where do you want us
to put the shit upstairs?

40:50.048 --> 40:53.552
I don't know. Find a place.
I got to see a guy.

40:53.619 --> 40:54.986
Okay, Billy.

41:10.602 --> 41:11.837
Father.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.544
I figure you came to my place,

41:18.610 --> 41:21.046
so I thought I'd come see yours.

41:21.112 --> 41:24.750
I have nothing to say
to you, Mr. McBride.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.553
Now please leave,
or I'll have you arrested.

41:33.424 --> 41:36.461
You know, I've looked into
a lot of eyeballs in my time.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.196
I read them pretty well.

41:38.263 --> 41:41.933
And when I look into yours,
I see something.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.235
You have information
on Ryan Larson,

41:44.302 --> 41:45.604
and if you don't start talking,

41:45.671 --> 41:47.839
not only will I
call your bishop,

41:47.906 --> 41:49.386
but I'll make things
a mess for you...

41:49.440 --> 41:50.676
I know absolutely nothing

41:50.742 --> 41:52.678
about what happened
on that boat.

41:57.082 --> 41:58.583
Neither do I.

41:58.584 --> 42:01.086
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

42:01.152 --> 42:04.756
What I want to know from you
is was he suicidal.

42:04.823 --> 42:07.593
Did he appear to you
to be suicidal?

42:07.659 --> 42:09.695
- I warned you.
- I'm not asking...

42:09.761 --> 42:11.172
You're not to be
fooled by the collar.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.707
Did you not take me
seriously, Mr. McBride?

42:12.731 --> 42:13.908
I don't think
you take me seriously.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.600
- Get out.
- I just...

42:15.601 --> 42:16.844
- Get...
- Take your hand off me.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.203
- Get out!
- Damn it.

42:18.269 --> 42:19.638
Get out!

42:19.705 --> 42:22.507
And don't you ever come back!

42:25.076 --> 42:26.444
Yeah, you're a big man.

42:26.511 --> 42:27.722
You can probably
beat me to death

42:27.746 --> 42:29.280
if you wanted to.
I get that.

42:29.347 --> 42:32.818
But I got other ways
of whipping people's
asses, too,

42:32.884 --> 42:35.120
and you might not like it.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.354
Just one more thing,

42:36.421 --> 42:38.657
and I'll get out
of here, all right?

42:38.724 --> 42:40.992
If Ryan Larson was suicidal,

42:41.059 --> 42:42.961
you would have done
something about it.

42:43.028 --> 42:44.529
You would have hooked him up

42:44.630 --> 42:46.097
with some kind of
health professional

42:46.164 --> 42:49.267
or some kind of group, a shrink,

42:49.334 --> 42:50.702
some kind of doctor...

42:50.769 --> 42:53.872
maybe Dr. Wallace.
I hear he's good.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.841
And at the very least,

42:55.907 --> 42:57.408
you would have
treated him the same

42:57.475 --> 42:58.810
as you would some common hooker

42:58.877 --> 43:00.646
who walked in here
off the street.

43:04.149 --> 43:07.719
I will search
Ryan Larson's computer.

43:10.188 --> 43:13.158
And I will get a court
order to search yours.

43:13.224 --> 43:14.693
You can believe that.

43:18.096 --> 43:21.299
All I'm asking for
is your humble opinion.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.903
The truth's big
to you, I'm sure.

43:24.970 --> 43:28.073
I understand the position
you're in. I really do.

43:28.139 --> 43:31.076
But there's a kid who doesn't
have a father anymore.

43:33.244 --> 43:36.281
I just want you to tell me
what you think, Father.

43:38.516 --> 43:40.251
Do you think he was suicidal?

43:43.722 --> 43:45.691
Do you think
Ryan Larson's suicidal?

43:45.757 --> 43:46.925
- That's all...
- No.

43:49.060 --> 43:50.295
He was not.

44:32.270 --> 44:35.173
I'm late for a meeting.
I got to go.

44:35.240 --> 44:39.010
You don't return calls.
That's not like you.

44:40.545 --> 44:42.547
Not having any regrets, are you?

44:42.613 --> 44:44.750
I don't have anything to regret.

44:45.851 --> 44:48.453
No. You don't.

44:51.757 --> 44:53.959
Your ex-husband needs
to learn some boundaries.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.194
You need to learn
some boundaries.

45:00.265 --> 45:01.265
He's invasive.

45:01.299 --> 45:02.968
Shouldn't be
stalking you like that.

45:03.034 --> 45:05.303
Oh, please.
He's not a stalker.

45:05.370 --> 45:06.371
He's a schmuck.

45:06.437 --> 45:09.174
He was just looking
for Denise or something.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.977
Thank God she was
on a school trip.

45:13.812 --> 45:17.282
The look on his face
was priceless.

45:17.348 --> 45:19.484
You really enjoyed that,
didn't you?

45:19.550 --> 45:20.819
Yeah. I did.

45:20.886 --> 45:22.788
I take my pleasure
where I can get it,

45:22.854 --> 45:25.156
particularly after having
to deal with him in court.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.258
Please stop. I don't want
to hear one more thing

45:27.325 --> 45:29.527
about the Borns Tech case,
nothing about Billy,

45:29.594 --> 45:30.594
nothing, got it?

45:30.628 --> 45:32.230
- Good.
- Good.

45:32.297 --> 45:33.398
Hey.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.802
You and I, we're okay, right?

45:36.835 --> 45:39.070
Yeah. We're the same
as always.

45:40.305 --> 45:42.440
I wish you were a nicer person.

45:42.507 --> 45:45.343
I wish everybody
in my life was nicer.

45:49.815 --> 45:52.383
I am very nice to you.

45:52.450 --> 45:54.485
You're so bad.

46:05.864 --> 46:10.835
Raah!

46:38.329 --> 46:41.366
Let me get more.
That's perfect.

46:41.432 --> 46:42.868
Okay. Thank you.

46:43.869 --> 46:45.003
Watch out.

46:45.070 --> 46:46.504
Don't get stabbed.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.408
♫ March, march ♫

46:50.475 --> 46:51.877
♫ March you all
to your deaths ♫

46:51.910 --> 46:53.011
Here you go.

46:53.078 --> 46:55.046
♫ March, march ♫

46:55.113 --> 46:56.747
♫ March you all to Vietnam ♫

46:56.882 --> 47:01.152
♫ Vietnam, waah! ♫

47:01.219 --> 47:02.753
Hey, Patty.

47:02.888 --> 47:04.455
Hey, Patty.

47:04.522 --> 47:06.457
Hey.

47:06.524 --> 47:07.558
Hi.

47:07.625 --> 47:09.027
How you doing?

47:09.094 --> 47:10.295
Do you live here?

47:10.361 --> 47:12.163
Oh, God, no. This is
my in-laws' house.

47:12.230 --> 47:13.798
It's my ex-in-laws' house

47:13.899 --> 47:15.901
on my... on my second
husband's side.

47:15.967 --> 47:18.003
What's up?

47:18.069 --> 47:19.237
Sis, you all right?

47:19.304 --> 47:21.706
Yeah, Milos, I'm fine, yeah.

47:21.772 --> 47:23.408
- You sure?
- Yeah.

47:23.474 --> 47:25.510
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Billy McBride.

47:25.576 --> 47:26.577
Milos.

47:26.644 --> 47:28.079
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.280
Hey, listen, stick around.

47:29.347 --> 47:30.916
We got some boxes to move later.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.084
You can probably
help us with that.

47:35.153 --> 47:37.288
I'm fine. Thank you.

47:37.355 --> 47:38.523
That's scary.

47:38.589 --> 47:41.526
He's sweet, though.
He's a sweet kid, yeah.

47:41.592 --> 47:44.495
- Doesn't look sweet.
- He doesn't know
his own strength.

47:44.562 --> 47:47.032
It's a problem sometimes.

47:47.098 --> 47:49.534
What is he, your cousin
or something?

47:49.600 --> 47:50.601
What's his deal?

47:50.668 --> 47:54.439
Uh, cousin-ish...
ex-cousin-ish.

47:54.505 --> 47:56.574
So that's kind of
what I wanted to hear.

47:56.641 --> 47:57.642
Hey, Milos.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.444
What are you doing?

47:59.510 --> 48:01.179
How'd you like a job?

48:35.513 --> 48:36.681
Ohh.

48:41.719 --> 48:43.288
Hello!

48:45.290 --> 48:46.324
Ohh.

49:32.803 --> 49:36.041
Oh, no. Oh, no.

49:39.677 --> 49:41.046
Fuck.

52:21.372 --> 52:24.809
Lucy, what a delight
to finally meet you.

52:29.347 --> 52:31.649
Mr. Cooperman.

52:35.820 --> 52:38.423
Please, it's Donald.

54:14.752 --> 54:16.321
You stinker!
