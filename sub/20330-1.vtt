00:36.916 --> 00:39.210
Not a perfect mood,
but-

00:39.210 --> 00:41.295
Well,
I don't know if it's-

00:41.295 --> 00:45.174
We're fucked up. But this is
how you deal with tragedy.

00:45.174 --> 00:47.385
You fucking hide it.

00:47.385 --> 00:48.386
You bury it.

00:48.386 --> 00:49.887
Where's the fucking bottle?

00:49.929 --> 00:51.514
Ba-ba-ba.

00:51.514 --> 00:54.600
He's a great guy.
He's a great guy.

00:56.352 --> 00:59.522
Why? Idiot.
Because we didn't die?

00:59.522 --> 01:02.316
Exactly. That's all
I have to say about that.

01:02.358 --> 01:05.987
Fuck it.

01:05.987 --> 01:08.656
Ah, man.

01:08.656 --> 01:10.283
Fuck it.

01:13.411 --> 01:16.539
We feel fucked up
about what just happened.

01:16.539 --> 01:17.999
You know what I'm saying?

01:17.999 --> 01:19.125
That we're talking about
our friend

01:19.125 --> 01:21.961
as a result of our condition.

01:21.961 --> 01:24.130
It is so removed.
Why am I shit?

01:29.051 --> 01:30.553
Oh, shit.

01:31.846 --> 01:33.723
That's all I want to do,

01:33.723 --> 01:37.268
is go home and be alive.

01:38.478 --> 01:40.271
Fuck it. Sorry.

01:40.271 --> 01:44.567
How am I going to
go back to my wife...

01:46.861 --> 01:51.741
and tell them
that he's gone?

02:41.289 --> 02:42.874
We might not even go.

02:42.874 --> 02:46.753
It don't have any sense,
doing this today.

02:46.753 --> 02:48.421
This is what
we're going to do.

02:48.421 --> 02:49.673
It's irritating as hell.

02:49.673 --> 02:50.674
If that's their aim,
they've achieved that.

02:50.674 --> 02:51.675
I'll tell you.

02:53.426 --> 02:56.596
A free loan to al-Bashir
for his palace, right.

02:56.596 --> 02:59.516
Did you know that?
You didn't know that?

02:59.516 --> 03:03.478
The Chinese gave an
interest-free loan to al-Bashir

03:03.478 --> 03:05.522
for his palace.

03:05.522 --> 03:08.150
How fucked up is that?

03:08.150 --> 03:09.860
Useless.

03:09.860 --> 03:13.155
Bashir's cocktail party,
I'd love to see you there.

03:13.155 --> 03:14.531
If they offered it,
they could use some training

03:14.531 --> 03:15.699
from the Chinese too.

03:15.699 --> 03:18.076
At least they might be
on fucking time.

03:22.455 --> 03:23.915
Surprise, surprise.

03:23.915 --> 03:25.792
Better late than never.

03:25.792 --> 03:29.379
If you all gather around,
I'll give our itinerary.

03:30.547 --> 03:32.591
Okay.
Now we are here.

03:32.591 --> 03:34.342
Hey, guys.

03:34.342 --> 03:37.387
We will be going
200 miles to the north.

03:39.973 --> 03:41.516
Please
pay attention.

03:41.516 --> 03:43.393
Sorry.

03:43.393 --> 03:46.688
I will cancel the mission if
I don't get complete attention

03:46.688 --> 03:49.816
and complete cooperation
from all of you.

03:49.816 --> 03:53.278
Do you understand?
This can be a dangerous area.

03:55.113 --> 03:56.323
Okay.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.533
It's going to take us
three hours to get there.

03:58.533 --> 03:59.743
We will be there
for approximately

03:59.743 --> 04:01.036
an hour
or an hour and a half.

04:01.036 --> 04:02.579
An hour and a half?
How long have been here?

04:02.579 --> 04:04.748
I don't want any discussion.
That's it.

04:04.748 --> 04:07.167
I need everybody
to sign their release forms.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.836
Once they are done,
we can make a move, okay?

04:13.048 --> 04:14.883
Turn the radio back on.

04:19.178 --> 04:23.600
Sun block 312.
An hour and a half.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.519
We have to spend the next
six hours with this guy.

04:36.196 --> 04:38.490
What's the agenda?
Can we load up?

04:38.490 --> 04:40.075
Can we put this stuff
in the back of the car?

04:40.075 --> 04:42.285
Let's go. Let's go.

04:42.285 --> 04:45.247
Let's go.
Bring your sun block.

04:47.749 --> 04:50.168
Here we go.
Decapitated by a tent.

04:56.132 --> 04:59.052
Hey. Hey.
Smile.

04:59.052 --> 05:01.555
Smile for the camera.
There we go.

05:01.555 --> 05:02.848
That's the game face.

05:35.213 --> 05:38.300
Oh man, that's hot.

05:38.341 --> 05:41.428
Africa hot.
That's what they say, right?

05:41.428 --> 05:42.804
Yeah, Africa hot.

05:44.306 --> 05:47.851
Sun block?
You want some sun block?

05:47.851 --> 05:49.311
No. No thanks.

05:49.311 --> 05:50.562
Okay.

05:50.562 --> 05:52.105
I'm sure
I've met you somewhere before.

05:52.105 --> 05:54.149
We haven't worked together,
have we?

05:54.149 --> 05:56.359
No.
Huh.

05:56.359 --> 05:57.944
I'll figure it out.

06:00.780 --> 06:02.491
You had
some big article though.

06:02.491 --> 06:04.534
Yeah, I've been lucky.

06:33.062 --> 06:35.064
It's funny because
everything looks the same.

06:35.064 --> 06:38.651
Everything is so flat, and
they have these cliffs up here

06:38.651 --> 06:41.028
that blocks your perspective
of where you are.

06:43.113 --> 06:45.366
What's that dust storm
up there?

06:45.366 --> 06:46.867
Would you mind
if I took your picture?

06:46.867 --> 06:49.620
My daughter wants me
to document everything.

06:49.620 --> 06:51.455
It's just a disposable.
Just a quickie.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.669
Thank you.

06:56.669 --> 06:58.295
It's a twister.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.884
You've been here before?

07:03.884 --> 07:06.512
Yeah,
I've been here before.

07:06.512 --> 07:09.640
That's cool.
This is my first time.

07:14.937 --> 07:16.689
You guys,
it's really hot in here.

07:16.689 --> 07:18.524
Could you
put on the air conditioner?

07:18.524 --> 07:20.985
Man, could you slow down
a minute?

07:20.985 --> 07:22.862
No. Keep going.
We have two hours to get there.

07:22.862 --> 07:24.280
We keeping going now-

07:24.280 --> 07:25.698
I understand that,
but if you look to your left-

07:25.698 --> 07:27.616
We keep going.
We have two hours to go.

07:27.616 --> 07:30.161
At ten o'clock there's a cut
on the left, I want you to-

07:30.161 --> 07:33.122
Head straight. We are
going through the village.

07:33.122 --> 07:34.498
We are supposed to
go through the village.

07:34.498 --> 07:37.001
We are here
with Captain Tobamke.

07:37.001 --> 07:38.252
We are not on a holiday. We are
going through the village.

07:38.252 --> 07:40.004
This is why you-

07:40.004 --> 07:42.590
They are African monitors here
to collect evidence of genocide

07:42.590 --> 07:44.175
and ceasefire infractions.

07:44.175 --> 07:46.468
Captain, would you say
that to our left is something

07:46.468 --> 07:49.930
that you would determine
as telltale signs of genocide,

07:49.930 --> 07:51.724
of a mass grave?
Any comments, please?

07:51.724 --> 07:53.184
Stop the car.

07:53.184 --> 07:55.060
Captain?

07:55.060 --> 07:57.771
Go ahead.
Stop over there.

08:11.410 --> 08:13.245
What's going on?

08:17.917 --> 08:20.836
Let's go and see,
shall we?

08:20.836 --> 08:23.130
Let's have look-see.

08:29.053 --> 08:30.596
Okay.

08:55.120 --> 08:58.916
The UN deliberates over whether
genocide is being perpetrated

08:58.916 --> 09:00.960
in the Darfur region.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.505
This happened because when
the sanctions were issued

09:04.505 --> 09:08.342
against the government,
the Janjaweed come to end.

09:08.342 --> 09:10.010
This is
the consequence of that.

09:10.010 --> 09:13.472
I see full-grown skulls
and children.

09:13.472 --> 09:14.765
Everybody.
The whole village.

09:14.765 --> 09:15.766
They would have burned
the whole village.

09:18.894 --> 09:21.188
You didn't know anything
about this, captain?

09:23.149 --> 09:27.611
All I can say is that this is
a result of the West sanction.

09:27.611 --> 09:28.988
It destroys the people
that are meant to be helped.

09:28.988 --> 09:30.739
You're saying the sanctions
are futile?

09:30.739 --> 09:33.534
The sanctions,
have done nothing.

09:33.534 --> 09:35.286
Bashir promises
one thing to the west

09:35.286 --> 09:36.871
and he does something
entirely different.

09:36.871 --> 09:38.581
So they're counter productive.

09:38.581 --> 09:41.876
So, what about
your inadequate security

09:41.876 --> 09:44.003
on the aid convoys?

09:44.003 --> 09:45.796
Because they're
consistently attacked

09:45.796 --> 09:47.631
by government militia,
right?

09:47.631 --> 09:49.800
And rebels, because of your
inadequate-
Okay.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.594
Come. Let's go.
We are done here.

09:51.594 --> 09:52.970
Come. Let's go.
Let's go.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.847
You don't want to
answer me, captain?

09:54.847 --> 09:56.557
It's a simple question.
We have to get to the village.

09:56.557 --> 09:57.808
Let's go. Let's go.

09:57.808 --> 09:59.852
What's the AU doing
to protect the Sudanese

09:59.852 --> 10:03.272
against these attacks
by its own government, captain?

10:03.272 --> 10:04.899
Captain!

10:06.609 --> 10:09.487
Everybody, let's go.
Back to the village.

10:09.487 --> 10:11.112
Come. Come.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.957
Gather round, please.
Gather round, please.

17:19.957 --> 17:23.877
This is Solaiman,
who is the head of the village.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.756
They say you are welcome, that
you can walk around the village,

17:27.756 --> 17:30.759
see what you want,
take pictures.

17:30.759 --> 17:34.012
Now, we are going to be here for
about an hour, hour and a half.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.348
There one or two people that may
speak a little bit of English,

17:36.348 --> 17:38.350
but we have somebody
to interpret for them.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.853
Yes.
So you guys are not interpreter.

17:40.853 --> 17:45.190
Also, they brought gifts for you
and the villagers.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.233
They are special
from this lady.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.359
Okay. Okay.

18:01.539 --> 18:05.626
He say, "Welcome,
the village is open for you."

18:05.626 --> 18:07.044
Okay.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.974
Just follow these guys.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.537
This is the-

20:04.537 --> 20:07.039
Yes, you can go.
Go.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.916
If you need any-

20:08.916 --> 20:10.626
Please, follow them.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.211
Yeah, thanks.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.134
Can you kindly ask the chief
if he has seen any evidence

20:18.134 --> 20:22.305
of Janjaweed and government
forces working together

20:22.305 --> 20:25.808
at any other raids
or interaction whatsoever?

20:25.808 --> 20:29.312
We don't have proof
about that that is clear.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.772
The people have an idea...

20:46.871 --> 20:49.123
As-Salamu Alaykum.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.500
Do you speak English?

22:37.522 --> 22:39.649
Delicious. Nutritious.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.362
Excuse me, miss.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.155
Do you mind
looking at the camera for me?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.699
Thank you.

23:44.631 --> 23:49.052
This number, they escape
and no one know where they are.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.096
Have the Janjaweed
been through this village

23:51.096 --> 23:55.559
or in the area at all?

24:04.943 --> 24:07.320
They never enter
in this village,

24:07.320 --> 24:11.491
but they destroyed
all the village surround us

24:11.491 --> 24:16.288
and all the people,
some of them killed,

24:16.288 --> 24:17.831
some of them go to the camp,

24:17.831 --> 24:21.168
and a lot of people,
he doesn't know where.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.465
He asks you,

24:26.465 --> 24:29.301
why the army of AU,

24:29.301 --> 24:32.012
you never protect us?

24:32.012 --> 24:35.849
Why do you come after all of
the villages are destroyed,

24:35.849 --> 24:39.769
and after that you come to us
and ask what's going on?

24:39.769 --> 24:42.230
You see, the only thing
I can say is that

24:42.230 --> 24:47.110
we've been given a very limited
mandate where Bashir,

24:47.110 --> 24:48.945
your president,
has allowed us into your country

24:48.945 --> 24:51.323
for only humanitarian reasons,

24:51.323 --> 24:54.201
so we have not
been given a mandate

24:54.201 --> 24:57.329
to engage or attack.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.789
All we can do is oversee.

24:59.789 --> 25:03.793
We can give food and shelter.

25:03.793 --> 25:04.711
And that is the extent.

25:04.711 --> 25:05.962
It is
a very good question.

25:09.090 --> 25:13.970
He say, always many people
from AU come in to ask

25:13.970 --> 25:16.473
what's going on
and what time that,

25:16.473 --> 25:20.018
but no anything
happened to us

25:20.018 --> 25:23.396
to protect or save our life.

25:25.398 --> 25:29.860
I will try and see whether
we can bring more troops here,

25:32.363 --> 25:35.574
whether or not we can agree that
there should be more protection.

25:35.574 --> 25:37.618
But as I said,
it is a very slow process.

25:37.618 --> 25:40.496
We are dealing
with politicians.

25:40.496 --> 25:43.833
I am just an army man
and I have my orders,

25:43.833 --> 25:47.461
but, please,
tell him that we are doing

25:47.503 --> 25:49.380
everything in our power
to make sure

25:49.380 --> 25:53.217
that the people are protected
and that the villages is safe.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.210
From the village?

26:29.378 --> 26:32.923
But still you rebuild.

26:32.923 --> 26:34.925
You're rebuilding now.
You're building.

26:37.303 --> 26:39.305
You keep building though.

26:49.773 --> 26:50.858
But why do you stay?
Why do you stay?

26:59.492 --> 27:02.703
So how long have you,
your family...

27:02.703 --> 27:03.787
How long have
you been living here?

27:13.756 --> 27:15.090
Of course.

27:15.090 --> 27:16.091
That would be great.

27:16.091 --> 27:18.385
Okay.
That would be good.

27:46.038 --> 27:46.831
This is your kids?

27:46.831 --> 27:48.582
Yeah.

28:04.098 --> 28:06.058
What is your name?

28:06.058 --> 28:08.352
My name
is Hadeeja Ibrahim.

28:08.352 --> 28:10.604
Hadeeja Ibrahim.
Nice to meet you.

28:10.604 --> 28:13.774
Have you suffered
sexual abuse?

29:16.419 --> 29:17.462
How old are you?

29:20.381 --> 29:24.594
Do you ever remember in your
life having any kind of peace?

29:34.813 --> 29:37.106
Yeah.
That's so sad.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.036
We're going to get help
for your country.

29:58.086 --> 29:59.629
It's okay.

30:12.517 --> 30:15.937
You're very brave
to talk to me.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.360
I can understand how hard
this must be for you.

30:49.179 --> 30:51.055
Thank you.

30:51.055 --> 30:54.225
If you could have

30:54.267 --> 30:58.438
one positive wish

30:58.438 --> 31:00.023
for your country,

31:00.023 --> 31:02.233
what would it be?

31:15.413 --> 31:19.417
We will make sure
that your story gets told

31:19.417 --> 31:23.046
and that people help you
and your country.

31:23.046 --> 31:25.799
Okay?

31:35.183 --> 31:37.143
The people, they-

31:40.897 --> 31:41.981
They people,
they raped me.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.285
It's the Janjaweed.

31:57.539 --> 31:59.165
They go around
and rape the women.

32:02.961 --> 32:06.840
Do you know if they are infected
with the AIDS virus?

32:06.840 --> 32:08.383
Do you have AIDS?

32:09.884 --> 32:11.886
I don't know
if I have AIDS.

32:11.886 --> 32:15.098
Maybe I don't.
Maybe I do.

32:15.098 --> 32:19.394
If I get sick,
then I'll know.

32:19.394 --> 32:22.647
If I die,
then I'll know.

32:25.358 --> 32:28.278
Do they make a point
of telling the women,

32:28.278 --> 32:31.239
frightening
the women perhaps,

32:31.239 --> 32:34.325
letting them think they are
infected when they rape them?

32:37.745 --> 32:39.622
I know other women,
they say-

32:39.622 --> 32:41.082
When they come to them
they say,

32:41.082 --> 32:44.252
"Yeah, we're going to
give you AIDS today.

32:44.252 --> 32:45.920
You're going to die today."

32:52.218 --> 32:54.846
The rapists and ethnic cleansers
of Darfur continue to operate

32:54.846 --> 32:58.850
despite the ceasefire agreement
and three UN resolutions.

32:58.850 --> 33:03.605
The world's biggest humanitarian
crisis is worsening.

33:03.605 --> 33:05.606
I'm really...

33:07.024 --> 33:08.817
I'm really sorry

33:08.817 --> 33:12.196
and grateful you could
tell us your story.

33:28.045 --> 33:31.882
On the way here today

33:31.882 --> 33:36.345
from the African Union,
their base-

33:36.345 --> 33:40.641
On the way here
we saw bones,

33:40.641 --> 33:42.309
human bones,

33:42.309 --> 33:46.355
a mass grave,
and it's not so far from here.

33:46.355 --> 33:48.690
Are you not afraid,

33:48.690 --> 33:52.861
knowing what the Janjaweed have
been doing to the villagers?

33:52.861 --> 33:56.573
Are you not afraid for
your wife, for your children?

34:22.349 --> 34:23.809
You were together.

34:23.809 --> 34:25.351
So you know them.

34:28.813 --> 34:30.482
They are Arab
and you are black.

34:33.527 --> 34:36.572
Is there a difference now
than there was before,

34:36.572 --> 34:41.034
because you both
lived in relative peace?

34:44.580 --> 34:46.039
What is this?

34:53.297 --> 34:55.549
This is the history of
your people, of the village?

34:58.010 --> 34:59.386
These are very precious?

35:05.017 --> 35:06.602
So it's not Muslim
against Muslim.

35:06.602 --> 35:09.313
It's more than that.
It's Arab against African.

35:19.072 --> 35:20.657
It's a racial war.

35:30.793 --> 35:31.710
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

35:34.254 --> 35:36.799
Great stuff, man. We got
some beautiful stuff there.

35:36.799 --> 35:39.092
Hundreds of years
this shit's been going on,

35:39.092 --> 35:41.053
killing each other.

35:41.053 --> 35:42.721
They seem
almost proud of it.

35:42.721 --> 35:43.889
Fuck.

35:45.098 --> 35:46.892
Yeah.
I know you're right.

35:46.892 --> 35:48.602
I'm trying
not to think about it.

36:09.498 --> 36:10.541
As-Salamu Alaykum.

36:10.541 --> 36:12.543
We have to go.
We have to leave now.

36:12.543 --> 36:14.128
We have to get back
before it gets dark.

36:21.051 --> 36:22.970
We are going.

37:26.032 --> 37:28.159
Look, down here.

37:28.159 --> 37:29.494
Stop here.

37:57.021 --> 37:59.065
It's not an AU convoy,
is it?

37:59.065 --> 38:01.234
No. The Janjaweed
are approaching.

38:02.485 --> 38:04.862
How far?
About 30 minutes away.

38:04.862 --> 38:06.948
They're heading
to that village?

38:06.948 --> 38:08.699
I don't know.
I can't be sure of that.

38:12.245 --> 38:14.831
Is there anything
we can do?

38:14.831 --> 38:16.457
I say we go back.

38:16.457 --> 38:17.834
We head back.
If we don't,

38:17.834 --> 38:19.585
they're going to
kill these people.

38:19.585 --> 38:20.503
If we're there,
they're not going to touch them

38:20.503 --> 38:23.464
with western media on site.
No.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.387
You're looking at me
like I'm crazy. What'd I say?

38:29.387 --> 38:31.597
No. I want to go back.
I think that's nuts.

38:31.597 --> 38:33.641
I think you're crazy
to think that.

38:33.641 --> 38:35.268
I think it's a good idea.
They're not going to do anything

38:35.268 --> 38:36.978
because
we're fucking Americans.

38:36.978 --> 38:37.812
We're here
to make a difference.

38:37.812 --> 38:39.814
We could save these people.

38:39.814 --> 38:41.816
You may be right.
If the press are there,

38:41.816 --> 38:44.485
it's quite possible
they won't touch the villagers.

38:44.485 --> 38:46.487
You know that's not
necessarily the case, captain.

38:46.487 --> 38:49.615
We don't know anything.
Yeah, you do.

38:49.615 --> 38:52.243
We don't know anything,
so the decision is yours.

38:52.243 --> 38:54.203
Yeah.
I say we go back.

38:54.203 --> 38:56.914
Are you guys fucking heroes?
We're here to report.

38:56.914 --> 38:58.332
What are you talking
about?

38:58.332 --> 39:00.293
What are we doing here if we're
not doing something positive?

39:00.293 --> 39:02.253
I think
it's a terrible idea.

39:02.253 --> 39:03.629
These people are dangerous.

39:03.629 --> 39:06.340
When we have been there before
the Janjaweed come past,

39:06.340 --> 39:07.758
and we have managed
to protect it.

39:07.758 --> 39:09.719
Now, we are not certain
they are going to the village.

39:09.719 --> 39:11.304
You can tell me for sure
that we'll be okay.

39:11.304 --> 39:13.848
We can't guarantee
your safety.

39:13.848 --> 39:16.684
They're not going to touch them
if we're there.

39:16.684 --> 39:18.227
Well, it won't be
all over the press

39:18.227 --> 39:20.605
if we don't make it back home.

39:20.605 --> 39:22.273
We can't do nothing,
and consciously know

39:22.273 --> 39:23.441
that they're getting
slaughtered.

39:23.441 --> 39:24.525
We have to
make a decision.

39:24.525 --> 39:26.277
If you want to go back,
you can go back.

39:26.277 --> 39:27.320
If you want to go home,
you can go home.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.863
We have to
make a decision now.

39:28.863 --> 39:31.532
You understand? We have to
make a decision now.

39:31.532 --> 39:33.367
I want to go back.
No, no, no, no.

39:33.367 --> 39:36.329
This is a mistake,
you guys.

39:36.329 --> 39:37.914
I don't want to
go fucking back.

39:37.914 --> 39:38.706
Okay, let's go.

39:41.250 --> 39:42.251
This is fucking great.

39:42.251 --> 39:45.087
I hope you know
what you're doing, captain.

39:45.087 --> 39:47.256
I don't think
it's a good idea, man.

39:47.256 --> 39:49.675
You're pretty handsome
in a Dennis Hopper kind of way.

39:52.011 --> 39:54.222
This is such a bad idea.
This isn't safe at all.

39:54.222 --> 39:56.474
No. We're going back.
We can save these people.

39:56.474 --> 39:58.059
We can
make a difference here.

39:58.059 --> 40:00.520
That's why
we're here, right?

40:00.520 --> 40:02.897
That's why
I'm here anyway.

40:14.784 --> 40:16.577
Come on, William,
let's go.

42:30.085 --> 42:31.545
Please,
stay in the car.

42:32.754 --> 42:34.256
Don't move.
Stay in the car.

42:37.717 --> 42:39.094
I need you
to gather everybody here

42:39.094 --> 42:41.263
as soon as possible,
please.

42:41.263 --> 42:43.265
Gather everybody here
as soon as possible, please.

42:48.728 --> 42:49.896
Come quick.

42:56.069 --> 42:58.113
Come. Come.

43:04.035 --> 43:05.954
Gather everybody.
Everybody, here.

43:07.622 --> 43:09.749
Everyone come now.
Quick, quick.

43:15.797 --> 43:18.383
Everybody, the Janjaweed
are approaching the village.

43:21.720 --> 43:25.056
We are not mandated
to engage them in any way.

43:27.934 --> 43:30.896
There are not enough
of us here to give them a fight,

43:30.896 --> 43:34.399
so what we want to do is, with
the help of these journalists,

43:34.399 --> 43:36.902
and hopefully these journalist''
presence and our presence,

43:36.902 --> 43:39.946
we will be able to persuade them
to move on through the village.

43:46.953 --> 43:48.455
F-16!
Everybody down!

43:54.336 --> 43:55.629
The Janjaweed are coming!
Take cover!

44:17.567 --> 44:19.110
Okay, everyone,
back to the vehicles!

44:19.110 --> 44:20.821
Back to the vehicles!
Stay together!

44:30.247 --> 44:31.623
I need everybody!

44:33.207 --> 44:34.959
Stay together.
Back to the vehicles!

44:34.959 --> 44:37.628
Back to the vehicles!
Now.

44:37.628 --> 44:38.712
Stay together.

44:52.935 --> 44:55.479
Try to stay calm.
Try to stay calm, everybody.

45:09.243 --> 45:11.245
I don't want to
fucking be here anymore.

45:11.245 --> 45:12.705
Fuck you!
Are you crazy?!

45:12.705 --> 45:15.708
Let's go. Let's get in
the fucking vehicle!

45:15.708 --> 45:17.084
I need you
to stay back here.

45:17.084 --> 45:19.170
Let's get the fuck
out of here!

45:19.170 --> 45:22.465
I will deal with this.
I will deal with this.

45:26.719 --> 45:28.429
Back to the vehicles,
now!

45:34.477 --> 45:36.437
AK-47 assault rifles.

45:44.820 --> 45:48.115
I see them fucking coming!

45:48.115 --> 45:50.493
Listen,
nothing's going to happen.

46:24.360 --> 46:25.402
Salaam Alaykum.

46:25.402 --> 46:27.029
Alaykum Salaam.

46:27.029 --> 46:28.739
Captain Tobamke.

46:31.075 --> 46:33.369
Why are they here?

46:33.369 --> 46:35.329
We are from the AU.

46:35.329 --> 46:37.331
We are an on observing mission
from the AU.

46:37.331 --> 46:40.668
I brought some journalists
to observe,

46:40.668 --> 46:42.378
to look at the village,
to bring supplies.

46:47.842 --> 46:49.218
I can't.

46:51.470 --> 46:53.139
I can't.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.021
We are just here to observe,

47:01.021 --> 47:03.482
to see about the welfare
of the villagers.

47:03.482 --> 47:05.067
You know you're not
supposed to be here, right?

47:05.067 --> 47:07.069
I understand.
You or the journalists.

47:07.069 --> 47:08.404
I understand.
So why are you here?

47:08.404 --> 47:09.697
We are allowed to observe.

47:09.697 --> 47:11.657
Is that what they teach you
at the African Union?

47:13.159 --> 47:14.994
We have been given a mandate
to observe, sir,

47:14.994 --> 47:15.995
and we are observing.

47:15.995 --> 47:18.873
We are making sure
that the villagers

47:18.873 --> 47:20.958
and their health is okay.

47:20.958 --> 47:22.042
We are here on a-

47:22.042 --> 47:23.294
You are not allowed
to do anything.

47:23.294 --> 47:24.295
We are allowed to observe.

47:24.295 --> 47:25.838
There is no observation,
captain.

47:25.838 --> 47:27.381
This is not your district.

47:27.381 --> 47:28.591
You are not supposed to
be here.

47:28.591 --> 47:30.009
These journalists
are not supposed to be here.

47:30.009 --> 47:31.969
You are not supposed to be
feeding anybody.

47:31.969 --> 47:33.179
Food does not help the dead.
You know that.

47:34.972 --> 47:36.474
These are international
journalists.

47:36.474 --> 47:39.685
I don't care. I don't care
about international anything.

47:39.685 --> 47:41.061
So please take your people
and leave

47:41.061 --> 47:42.396
if you want to protect them.

47:42.396 --> 47:43.898
I've been
very patient with you.

47:43.898 --> 47:46.275
Turn around, tell these people
to pack their stuff and go.

47:46.275 --> 47:48.319
I will request
that you take your men

47:48.319 --> 47:50.029
and move through the village.

47:50.029 --> 47:52.156
Let us do our work here.
You think so?

47:52.156 --> 47:53.449
Please,
let us do our work.

47:53.449 --> 47:54.784
You think you're going to
tell me what to do?

47:54.784 --> 47:56.243
I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm suggesting.

47:56.243 --> 47:57.995
That's what it sounds like.

47:57.995 --> 48:01.373
I'm just asking that maybe
you guys can move on through.

48:01.373 --> 48:04.084
We'll be here for another five,
ten minutes. The journalists-

48:04.084 --> 48:06.253
Captain, I'm going to
give them five minutes.

48:06.253 --> 48:07.671
If they do not leave,

48:07.671 --> 48:09.632
I'm going to consider them
a part of this village.

48:09.632 --> 48:12.802
If you want to protect your
people go tell them right now.

48:12.802 --> 48:15.596
Now, captain!

48:15.596 --> 48:16.806
You don't believe me?

48:20.434 --> 48:23.144
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

48:30.401 --> 48:32.028
He's given us five minutes
to leave the village.

48:32.028 --> 48:33.822
Now, I suggest
we get in the cars

48:33.822 --> 48:35.490
because we are totally
outmanned and outnumbered.

48:35.490 --> 48:37.492
I don't want to
inflame the situation.

48:37.492 --> 48:38.618
So everybody in the cars.

48:38.618 --> 48:40.328
Hello. May I?

48:40.328 --> 48:41.621
What do you think
you're doing?

48:41.621 --> 48:43.081
My name is Bob Jones.

48:43.081 --> 48:44.290
I don't care who you are.

48:44.290 --> 48:45.416
I'm with
the international press.

48:45.416 --> 48:46.876
I'd like to know
if you have the opportunity

48:46.876 --> 48:48.628
to grant us an interview
to the international media

48:48.628 --> 48:49.879
whereby you agree-

48:49.879 --> 48:51.422
You take out this village
while we're here-

48:51.422 --> 48:53.341
Get this woman
out of my face.

48:53.341 --> 48:55.552
Somebody has to teach you not
to speak when men are talking.

48:55.552 --> 48:56.803
You too.
I apologize for her.

48:56.803 --> 48:58.388
I don't want to see you.
I said you have five minutes.

48:58.388 --> 49:00.598
Now you don't. You need to
get into your cars and leave.

49:00.598 --> 49:01.724
Is there nothing you want to say
to the international community?

49:01.724 --> 49:03.852
Musa! Sadiq!

49:03.852 --> 49:06.271
Move!
Hey, hey, hey!

49:06.271 --> 49:08.273
I can do that.

49:08.273 --> 49:09.816
All right, how much?
We give you-

49:13.111 --> 49:16.489
In the car! Everybody
in the car now, please!

49:16.489 --> 49:20.243
Everybody
back in the vehicle now.

49:20.243 --> 49:21.202
I am responsible
for your welfare.

49:21.244 --> 49:24.289
In the car.

49:24.289 --> 49:25.415
Back in the vehicle.

49:25.415 --> 49:27.041
We don't want to
inflame the situation.

49:27.041 --> 49:28.042
Adrian, come on, man.

49:30.753 --> 49:32.172
In the car.
Let's go. Let's go.

49:44.934 --> 49:46.895
What the fuck is that?

49:46.895 --> 49:48.521
Let's go. Let's go.

49:48.521 --> 49:49.814
You can't have
this baby here.

49:49.814 --> 49:50.899
It's not safe.

49:50.899 --> 49:51.816
Dude,
he's right there.

49:51.816 --> 49:53.735
Make him
stop crying, quick.

50:03.203 --> 50:04.746
Christ.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.917
Get back in
so that we can pull out.

50:14.464 --> 50:16.174
It is an AU vehicle.

50:37.320 --> 50:38.488
Come, come, come, come.

50:58.550 --> 51:01.594
Come on.
Just don't hurt it.

51:01.594 --> 51:03.012
We made a mistake,
all right.

51:23.158 --> 51:25.243
In the car. In the car.
In the car.

51:25.243 --> 51:26.494
Come.

58:14.692 --> 58:16.652
Stop the car.

58:16.652 --> 58:19.030
Stop the car.
Stop the car.

58:28.748 --> 58:31.292
What's going on?

58:31.292 --> 58:33.127
I'm going back.

58:33.127 --> 58:34.670
No, you can't.
Get back in the car.

58:34.670 --> 58:36.464
At least
give me a weapon.

58:36.464 --> 58:37.882
I can't.
I have orders.

58:37.882 --> 58:39.467
Get in the car.
Give me a weapon.

58:39.467 --> 58:40.718
A weapon?

58:40.718 --> 58:41.969
I have orders.
I don't care.

58:41.969 --> 58:43.638
I have to go back.

58:43.638 --> 58:44.680
What are you
talking about, man?

58:44.680 --> 58:46.098
Come on.

58:48.935 --> 58:50.478
Give me your weapon.

58:50.478 --> 58:52.105
Give me a weapon.
Slow down, man.

58:52.105 --> 58:53.981
What's going on?
I can't.

58:53.981 --> 58:55.566
In the car.

58:55.566 --> 58:56.859
What are you doing?

58:56.859 --> 58:58.778
Come.
Come on.

58:58.778 --> 59:00.029
What's happening here?

59:00.029 --> 59:01.405
You know what?
I'll use my own weapon.

59:01.405 --> 59:04.742
Sorry, but I have to do this.
Freddie.

59:04.742 --> 59:06.828
What's going on?
I'll use my own weapon.

59:06.828 --> 59:08.663
Will you just slow down
for a minute?

59:08.663 --> 59:09.789
Freddie, you don't have to
do this.

59:09.789 --> 59:11.165
That's my camera.

59:11.165 --> 59:12.583
Freddie,
what are you doing, man?

59:12.583 --> 59:14.085
That's my fucking camera.
Come on.

59:14.085 --> 59:15.336
You're not going to help them
by getting yourself killed.

59:15.336 --> 59:17.004
Freddie, I've got
50 fucking grand tied up.

59:17.004 --> 59:18.965
It's not fucking insured.
Sorry about this.

59:19.966 --> 59:21.134
Sorry. Listen.

59:21.134 --> 59:22.218
Hold on, would ya?

59:22.218 --> 59:24.345
Take it easy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:24.345 --> 59:25.471
Fuck off!

59:25.471 --> 59:27.265
Get the fuck away from me,
motherfucker.

59:29.809 --> 59:32.436
Are you going to do that?
Are you going to do that to me?

59:32.436 --> 59:33.771
Captain, please,
just take it easy.

59:33.771 --> 59:35.398
You going to
let that happen down there?

59:35.398 --> 59:37.024
What happens
if that was you?

59:37.024 --> 59:40.445
What happens if it was
your wife and your kids?!

59:40.445 --> 59:42.947
I have orders.
You have orders?!

59:42.947 --> 59:44.657
If that was
your wife and kids,

59:44.657 --> 59:46.617
you're going to
let them be-

59:48.952 --> 59:51.788
Shoot me!
Shoot me!

59:53.290 --> 59:55.208
We shouldn't have gone back.
I'm sorry, man.

59:55.208 --> 59:57.127
Now let's just
get back in the car.

59:59.045 --> 01:00:03.633
You want to go back,
go back.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:07.345
Go.
Go back.

01:00:07.345 --> 01:00:09.473
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:10.765
What are you doing?

01:00:10.765 --> 01:00:12.559
You give him a weapon?
That is a fucking-

01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:13.852
Get in the car!

01:00:13.852 --> 01:00:15.353
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

01:00:15.353 --> 01:00:17.022
Everybody else in the car.

01:00:17.022 --> 01:00:18.774
Theo.

01:00:18.774 --> 01:00:21.151
Just make sure
this story gets told.

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:22.652
You tell this story.
What?

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:25.822
Where's he going?
Don't be a fucking idiot.

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:28.074
It's suicide!

01:00:28.074 --> 01:00:30.035
Back in the cars now.

01:00:30.035 --> 01:00:34.206
Freddie, get back here,
you fucking idiot!

01:00:34.206 --> 01:00:35.791
Back in the vehicles.

01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:36.792
Come, come.

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:38.877
You stubborn fucking moron.

01:00:38.877 --> 01:00:39.961
You gave an untrained man
a weapon.

01:00:39.961 --> 01:00:42.547
Get back here,
you fucking idiots.

01:00:42.547 --> 01:00:44.007
What are you doing?
You gave him a weapon.

01:00:56.394 --> 01:00:58.063
Take the others back.
Go.

01:01:03.276 --> 01:01:05.445
Where's he going?
Get in the fucking car.

01:01:05.445 --> 01:01:06.947
Where are you going?

01:06:46.952 --> 01:06:49.455
Okay.
This is it.

01:06:49.455 --> 01:06:51.165
I hope
god is watching over us.

01:06:52.958 --> 01:06:55.711
Okay. Come.

01:06:56.962 --> 01:06:58.464
Cover me.

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.434
You ever
killed anybody?

01:07:11.977 --> 01:07:14.146
Didn't think so.

01:07:14.146 --> 01:07:15.272
You may have to.

01:07:21.112 --> 01:07:22.363
All right.
Cover me.

01:10:04.232 --> 01:10:06.234
You come here
in your AU uniform

01:10:06.234 --> 01:10:09.279
thinking you can
save those people.

01:10:09.279 --> 01:10:12.907
You must think this badge
on your arm means something.

01:10:12.907 --> 01:10:14.909
It means nothing.

01:10:14.909 --> 01:10:18.371
No one will save those people,
because just like you,

01:10:18.371 --> 01:10:21.416
they are black African monkeys
and no one cares for them.

01:10:37.348 --> 01:10:39.225
Oh, no. Tobamke.

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.270
Watch out!

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.400
Go. Come on.
Let's go.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.194
Go, go, go. Run.
Go now.

01:10:52.447 --> 01:10:53.114
Stop.

01:10:55.992 --> 01:10:57.786
Go now. Go, go.

01:13:42.699 --> 01:13:43.867
What?

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:47.454
Freddie, wait.

01:13:47.454 --> 01:13:49.289
Get off her,
you fucker!

01:13:55.087 --> 01:13:58.465
You okay?

01:13:58.465 --> 01:13:59.466
Freddie?

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.762
It's all right.

01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:08.976
It's okay.

01:14:16.275 --> 01:14:17.609
Let's go.

01:14:25.826 --> 01:14:27.661
Come on.
We've gotta go.

01:14:37.337 --> 01:14:39.006
Jesus Christ.

01:14:40.048 --> 01:14:41.258
We've gotta go.

01:14:49.475 --> 01:14:50.893
Jesus.

01:14:50.893 --> 01:14:52.394
Can she walk?

01:14:55.063 --> 01:14:57.649
Listen to me.
This is it.

01:14:57.649 --> 01:14:58.942
There's nothing else
we can do.

01:15:01.153 --> 01:15:02.446
We've gotta
get her out of here now.

01:15:02.446 --> 01:15:04.156
To the car?
Yeah.

01:15:06.574 --> 01:15:08.493
Honey,
can you walk?

01:15:10.912 --> 01:15:12.997
You watch my ass.
I'll take the lead.

01:15:12.997 --> 01:15:14.123
All right?
Okay.

01:15:14.123 --> 01:15:16.417
Let's go.
Follow my lead.

01:18:51.299 --> 01:18:52.967
Listen to me.

01:18:52.967 --> 01:18:55.051
I have to make it
to those huts.

01:18:55.051 --> 01:18:57.345
Wait there for me,
all right?

01:18:57.345 --> 01:18:58.638
My signal.

01:19:37.552 --> 01:19:38.970
Let's go.

01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:41.139
Jesus. Jesus.

01:19:43.183 --> 01:19:46.144
She's gone.
Come on. Come on.

01:19:46.144 --> 01:19:47.395
You got her?

01:19:49.439 --> 01:19:51.566
Let's go. Let's go.
We've gotta go now.

01:19:54.486 --> 01:19:56.196
Here we go.
Here we go.

01:19:57.781 --> 01:19:58.865
Oh, God.

01:20:04.371 --> 01:20:07.499
All right.

01:20:07.499 --> 01:20:09.334
This is it.
I can see the truck.

01:20:09.334 --> 01:20:10.669
We've just
gotta make it there.

01:20:12.879 --> 01:20:15.715
Ready?
Okay. It's clear.

01:20:15.715 --> 01:20:16.716
Go.

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:43.034
Come on!
Come on!

01:20:46.246 --> 01:20:48.165
Freddie, come on.
Freddie, come on.

01:20:48.165 --> 01:20:49.458
Come on, get up.

01:20:49.458 --> 01:20:51.376
No, no.

01:21:15.317 --> 01:21:17.861
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.

01:21:37.005 --> 01:21:39.549
Shh.

01:22:12.332 --> 01:22:14.000
Journalist, huh?

01:22:15.293 --> 01:22:16.503
Get up! Get up!

01:22:52.913 --> 01:22:54.081
You know this entire mess

01:22:54.081 --> 01:22:56.542
is because of
you and your kind, huh?

01:22:56.542 --> 01:22:59.378
You come here
and tell our people what to do.

01:22:59.378 --> 01:23:02.131
You tell the Darfur people
that they have rights,

01:23:02.131 --> 01:23:04.049
and their rights
are being violated,

01:23:04.049 --> 01:23:06.969
instead of apologizing.

01:23:06.969 --> 01:23:09.638
We're supposed to say
we're sorry,

01:23:09.638 --> 01:23:12.183
we're sorry we colonized you
for so long.

01:23:12.183 --> 01:23:15.144
We're sorry we enslaved
your people for decades.

01:23:15.144 --> 01:23:16.854
We're sorry we've given you
all these weapons

01:23:16.854 --> 01:23:19.064
to kill each other with.

01:23:19.064 --> 01:23:21.734
Huh? Guess who has
the weapons now?

01:23:27.323 --> 01:23:29.575
Are you sorry?

01:23:29.575 --> 01:23:31.494
Are you fucking sorry?!

01:23:34.246 --> 01:23:37.333
I'm going to let you go.

01:23:37.333 --> 01:23:38.918
I'm going to send you back
with a message.

01:23:38.918 --> 01:23:40.252
No, no.

01:23:40.252 --> 01:23:41.837
I want you
to tell the West

01:23:41.837 --> 01:23:44.715
that Darfur is now clean
of Africans.

01:23:44.715 --> 01:23:47.676
What are you going to say?
What is the message?

01:23:47.676 --> 01:23:50.346
What is the message?!

01:23:50.346 --> 01:23:52.348
Look up here.

01:23:52.348 --> 01:23:53.808
What are you going to say?

01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:56.435
What are you going to say?!

01:24:02.399 --> 01:24:03.734
You're not going to
say it, huh?

01:27:45.455 --> 01:27:48.583
You hide it.
You fucking bury it.

01:28:15.485 --> 01:28:18.947
You feel fucked up
about what just happened.

01:28:18.947 --> 01:28:19.781
You know what I'm saying?

01:28:33.586 --> 01:28:38.049
How am I going to
go back to my wife?

01:28:38.049 --> 01:28:40.385
Just go home
and be alive.

01:29:36.483 --> 01:29:38.485
Hello?

01:29:43.281 --> 01:29:45.283
Hello?

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.935
Hello?

01:30:32.454 --> 01:30:35.332
Theo?

01:30:35.332 --> 01:30:38.669
Freddie?

01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:40.838
Hello?

01:30:52.141 --> 01:30:54.017
Theo!

01:30:54.017 --> 01:30:55.936
Oh, my God.

01:30:57.354 --> 01:30:58.897
Theo!

01:31:08.574 --> 01:31:10.451
Shh.

01:31:41.774 --> 01:31:43.484
Oh, god.

01:32:16.433 --> 01:32:18.102
Give him some water.
