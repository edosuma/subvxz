00:09.551 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:14.180


00:17.726 --> 00:19.644


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:26.067 --> 00:29.779


00:29.863 --> 00:32.157


00:32.240 --> 00:34.284


00:34.367 --> 00:37.454


00:38.163 --> 00:40.582


00:41.041 --> 00:44.044


00:46.546 --> 00:49.382
<i>Attention campers.</i>
<i>Care packages incoming.</i>

00:49.466 --> 00:52.177
Whew!

00:53.386 --> 00:56.264
<i>Please exercise caution. Or don't.</i>

00:56.347 --> 00:58.057
<i>I don't really care.</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:00.769


01:00.852 --> 01:04.564
Sweet! New issues of<i> Dung Beetle Bird</i>!

01:04.647 --> 01:07.609
He's a sparrow who gets bitten
by a radioactive dung beetle

01:07.692 --> 01:10.320
and becomes Dung Beetle Bird!

01:10.403 --> 01:12.113
What did you get?

01:12.197 --> 01:13.573
New basketbird ball.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.451
A tail feather comb. Yay!

01:18.328 --> 01:23.374
Ugh! Check out the losers getting
all excited about their sad little gifts.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.293
So pathetic.

01:25.376 --> 01:29.339
Look, that one didn't even
get anything. Ha!

01:29.422 --> 01:30.423
Neither did you.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.050
That's not the point, sis.

01:32.133 --> 01:36.012
If I did get one, it would be cooler
than some dumb butt comb.

01:36.095 --> 01:39.390
Come on, let's laugh
derisively at the yellow one.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.019
Flying boat!

01:44.187 --> 01:46.189
Flying boat incoming!

01:46.272 --> 01:48.608
Look out, non-flying boats!

01:51.778 --> 01:52.737
Whew!

02:01.663 --> 02:02.831
Ugh!

02:02.914 --> 02:05.959
That's gotta be the biggest
care package I've ever seen!

02:06.042 --> 02:08.753
That's no care package. That's a boat!

02:08.837 --> 02:10.964
That's no boat.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.635
That's a yacht.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.305
Ohh! Robin!
Mummy finally sent us a yacht!

02:19.389 --> 02:23.268
Then she spelled our names wrong,
because it says "to Chuck."

02:23.351 --> 02:25.186
-What?

02:25.270 --> 02:26.771
Wait, what? Him?

02:26.855 --> 02:30.024
Whoa, Chuck!
Your parents sent you a yacht?

02:30.108 --> 02:32.610
I had no idea your family
were yacht cheeple.

02:32.694 --> 02:36.239
I didn't either. I didn't think I knew,
or maybe I did. Did I?

02:36.322 --> 02:39.909
But none of that matters
because we're having a yacht party!

02:39.993 --> 02:41.828
-Oh boy!
-Yes! All right!

02:41.911 --> 02:44.455
-Sweet!
-All right!

02:44.539 --> 02:47.333
Yacht party! Let's do this, friends!

02:47.417 --> 02:49.210
Um, what are you doing?

02:49.294 --> 02:52.130
Obviously I'm going
to my friend's yacht party.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.132
Yeah, but we're not friends.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.968
What do you call it when someone's
mean to you for no good reason?

02:57.051 --> 02:59.971
I think the word
you're looking for is jerk.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.390
Charles-- Can I call you Charles?

03:02.473 --> 03:06.811
If you're gonna host a yacht party,
it needs to be perfect. <i>N'est-ce pas</i>?

03:06.895 --> 03:09.230
I never really thought about it before.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.357
But yes, I guess it does!

03:11.441 --> 03:14.736
Exactly. Well, then you've
gotta have a buffet.

03:14.819 --> 03:15.945
A buffet?

03:16.029 --> 03:19.574
And I can hook you up with one
from the private dining hall.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.451
There's a private dining hall?

03:21.534 --> 03:24.579
Of course! It's exclusive,

03:24.662 --> 03:29.792
but I'm thinking I could
pull some strings for a friend.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.169
Chuck, where are you going?

03:31.252 --> 03:34.923
Didn't you hear him?
Exclusive-dining-string-buffet-pulling!

03:35.006 --> 03:38.801
I gotta go! I need this yacht party
to be perfect. I'll be right back!

03:39.844 --> 03:42.096
I'm sure this is gonna turn out great.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.728
Wow! You weren't kidding.

03:48.811 --> 03:52.523
This is easily in the top five
fanciest dining rooms I've ever been in.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.360
Top one, counting ones I haven't
been kicked out of!

03:55.443 --> 03:56.736
Have you met Darcy?

03:56.819 --> 03:59.697
He's another member
of our exclusive dining club.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.074
Haw-haw!

04:01.157 --> 04:03.660
Wow, even Brenda's fancy in here.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.786
Good day, sir.

04:04.869 --> 04:10.041
Before our luncheon selection,
may I interest anyone in a hot towel?

04:10.124 --> 04:11.626
Don't mind if I do!

04:13.253 --> 04:16.422
Mmm! One hundred percent cotton-y!

04:17.173 --> 04:19.008
The buffet is served.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.886
Oh, that's a buffet.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.973
Back home, we call this
an "eat till it hurts."

04:29.018 --> 04:30.061
Ugh!

04:32.313 --> 04:35.733
You were so right! This is amazing!

04:35.817 --> 04:37.694
My yacht party's gotta have one.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.237
I knew you'd agree!

04:39.320 --> 04:41.823
I'll have Brenda pack this up immediately.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.409
Now, let's head over there, shall we?

04:44.492 --> 04:45.618
I don't know.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.038
Red hates you,
Stella wants to pound your beak,

04:49.122 --> 04:52.083
Bomb is kind of "meh," and me, well…

04:54.669 --> 04:55.920
Haw-haw!

04:57.130 --> 04:59.590
Duly noted, Charles.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.092
Don't be hasty.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.512
Allow me to show you what else
I can bring to the party.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.730
Just imagine you and I on the yacht,
the wind in our hair feathers,

05:13.813 --> 05:18.901
with DJ Dinners, a masseuse,
and a mini-putt course.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.486
Ooh!

05:21.612 --> 05:22.905
-Ow

05:22.989 --> 05:27.118
-And the <i>pièce de résistance</i>, this!

05:27.618 --> 05:29.329
Ooh! A hot tub!

05:29.412 --> 05:32.498
What? No. It's caviar
from my private stash.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.084
Whoo-hoo!

05:39.047 --> 05:42.550
That was my entire caviar supply
for the summer!

05:42.633 --> 05:44.469
You… you…

05:44.552 --> 05:47.638
You know what would be perfect?

05:47.722 --> 05:50.099
Bringing all of this to the yacht party.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.351
-Yo, yo.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.229
-What do you say?
-I want it all. I need it all!

05:55.313 --> 05:58.149
I can't throw my party without it!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

05:58.232 --> 06:02.028
You're welcome!
If I can come to your yacht party.

06:08.743 --> 06:13.414
Ahoy, mateys! Welcome aboard
the <i>SS Awesomeness</i>!

06:13.498 --> 06:15.291
-Oh, cool! Sweet!
-Chick'n awesome!

06:15.374 --> 06:17.418
-Yeah!
-Oh, yeah.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.712
You're welcome.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.298
What do you think you're doing,
Neiderjerk?

06:22.381 --> 06:24.467
Yeah. What is he doing here?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.178
Well, I kind of, sort of
told him he could come

06:27.261 --> 06:29.555
in exchange for letting us use
all this cool stuff.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.598
You what?

06:30.681 --> 06:32.934
You guys! It's a big boat!

06:33.017 --> 06:36.729
And I got everything we need
to make this party perfect!

06:36.813 --> 06:37.939
Eh!

06:39.690 --> 06:43.694
Wonderful. Then we're all agreed.
And I invited some people, too.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.659
-Huh?
-Haw-haw!

07:03.256 --> 07:04.632
-Yoink!
-Oof!

07:07.969 --> 07:09.387
Uh…

07:14.475 --> 07:17.186
Chuck! These jerks
are ruining the party!

07:17.270 --> 07:19.230
What? We're ruining the party?

07:19.313 --> 07:21.732
We didn't bring a bunch
of uninvited guests!

07:21.816 --> 07:23.401
Or anything else,
for that matter.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.237
Charles, these cheeple
aren't yacht cheeple.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.822
They clearly don't belong.

07:27.905 --> 07:31.159
He's just using you for your yacht.
Can't you see that?

07:31.242 --> 07:32.994
Can you see this?

07:33.077 --> 07:35.496
-That's it!
-Bring it on!

07:36.831 --> 07:38.499
Just try it, Neiderjerk!

07:38.583 --> 07:40.126
Chuck, you need to do something!

07:40.209 --> 07:41.252
\

07:41.335 --> 07:45.840
Oh, you're right! I do have to do
something! I'm just gonna--

07:47.884 --> 07:49.051
Where's he going-- Whoa!

07:49.135 --> 07:50.928
-What the--?
-Chuck!

07:54.765 --> 07:56.058
Uh, what are you doing?

07:56.142 --> 07:57.894
This yacht is tearing us apart!

07:57.977 --> 07:59.979
Get rid of the yacht,
get rid of the problem.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.606
What? That makes no sense.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.317
The yacht's
not the problem, Neiderflyer is!

08:04.400 --> 08:06.861
-Actually, that's the problem.
-Ahh!

08:09.447 --> 08:10.948
We're heading for camp!

08:11.032 --> 08:13.951
Did I mention I have no idea
what I'm doing here?

08:14.035 --> 08:14.994
I've had enough!

08:15.077 --> 08:17.872
I can't believe anyone would
ever give you a yacht.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.083
It should belong to someone
who deserves her, like me.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.839
And now it's all mine.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.718
Party's over, Neiderflyer.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.617
Oh! Look out!

08:57.787 --> 08:59.372
Chuck! The dining hall!

08:59.455 --> 09:02.708
-We're going to crash!
-Everybody abandon ship!

09:02.792 --> 09:04.001
Okay, bye!

09:04.085 --> 09:06.712
-Look out!
-What's happening?

09:07.296 --> 09:08.381
Haw-haw!

09:08.464 --> 09:10.091
Go! I have a plan!

09:10.174 --> 09:11.717
Then we'll do it together.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.136
Chuck's yacht, Chuck's friends.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.472
And… hit the brakes!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.266
Boat's don't have brakes.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.059
Crud. That was my whole plan.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.519
-Haw-haw!
-Ohh!

09:21.602 --> 09:23.563
Darcy, what are you--

09:23.646 --> 09:25.565
The anchor, of course!

09:25.648 --> 09:28.442
The brakes of the sea! Hang on, everybody!

09:33.656 --> 09:34.699
Yes!

09:34.782 --> 09:36.075
All right, Chuck!

09:41.872 --> 09:44.292
-Chuck!
-Yacht!

09:50.381 --> 09:51.340
I'm okay!

09:52.883 --> 09:54.093
-Whoa!
-Whew!

09:54.176 --> 09:55.219
Oh! Chuck!

09:55.303 --> 09:59.640
My yacht! My beautiful yacht!

09:59.724 --> 10:02.059
For the last time, it's Chuck's yacht.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.563
You're both wrong.
Yacht got sent to the wrong bird.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.732
But the label says Chuck on it.

10:07.815 --> 10:11.319
Actually it's for
Cornelius Chuckington the Third.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.362
Hmm. Guess the label got wet.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.615
We'll get this out of here for you.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.576
Eh, I was always more
of a submarine kind of bird.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.662
Still, it is a shame about the party.

10:21.746 --> 10:25.207
You know… It's yacht gone yet.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.377
-Ohh!

10:28.461 --> 10:30.254
How do we turn the bubbles on?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.381
Don't worry, cheeps. I got this…

10:32.465 --> 10:34.550
-caviar bubbling]

10:34.634 --> 10:38.137
Not my caviar! Ugh!

10:39.430 --> 10:40.806
Haw-haw!
