WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:03.670
TONIGHT ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,</i>

00:03.670 --> 00:06.006
CHEF RAMSAY HEADS
TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN TOWN

00:06.006 --> 00:07.674
WOODLAND PARK, COLORADO...

00:07.674 --> 00:08.842
OH, MY GOD.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.843
AND DISCOVERS

00:09.843 --> 00:10.844
A <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES</i> FIRST...

00:10.844 --> 00:11.887
GO TO THE WINDOW.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.138
A CASUAL, FINE DINING

00:13.138 --> 00:17.142
ITALIAN RESTAURANT
WITH A DRIVE-THROUGH.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.895
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.813
THIS BIZARRE RESTAURANT IS RUN

00:21.813 --> 00:24.691
BY A VERY VOCAL OWNER
NAMED JULIE.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.401
WE GOT A  PROBLEM.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.444
SHE IS CLEARLY THE JUDGE...

00:27.444 --> 00:28.570
YOU DON'T HANDLE THIS KITCHEN.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.571
I HANDLE THIS  KITCHEN.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.000
THE JURY...

00:30.000 --> 00:30.572
THE JURY...

00:30.572 --> 00:31.573
WHAT THE  IS THIS?

00:31.573 --> 00:32.950
AND THE DICTATOR

00:32.950 --> 00:34.326
OF THE STRUGGLING
ESTABLISHMENT.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.327
YOU GO AWAY.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.204
<i>GO AWAY FROM MY FACE</i>
<i>RIGHT NOW.</i>

00:37.204 --> 00:38.413
SHE NOT ONLY REFUSES

00:38.413 --> 00:40.082
TO LISTEN TO HER STAFF...

00:40.082 --> 00:41.959
USE THE ONE IN THE BACK,
I SAID.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.210
BUT CHEF RAMSAY AS WELL.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.586
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT'S
GOING ON BEHIND HERE?

00:44.586 --> 00:46.505
WE'VE BEEN COOKING THESE
FOR FOUR YEARS THIS WAY.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.881
ALL OF THE SUDDEN,
THEY'RE  UP?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.633
JULIE'S DEFENSE IS TO GO

00:49.633 --> 00:50.676
ON THE OFFENSE...

00:50.676 --> 00:52.302
OUR SPINACH HAS NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER,

00:52.302 --> 00:53.512
NEVER LOOKED LIKE THIS.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.222
POINTING THE FINGERS AT OTHERS.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.599
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT, TREVOR?</i>
<i>YOU REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING.</i>

00:57.599 --> 00:58.642
THE HEAD CHEF?

00:58.642 --> 01:00.000
HE HAS ONLY TWO MOODS...

01:00.000 --> 01:00.310
HE HAS ONLY TWO MOODS...

01:00.310 --> 01:02.229
KISS MY ASS.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.230
DOWNRIGHT ANGRY...

01:03.230 --> 01:04.356
<i>SHE DOESN'T WANT TO LISTEN</i>

01:04.356 --> 01:05.899
TO ANYTHING WE HAVE
TO  SAY.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.067
OR PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.735
THEY DON'T LIKE THIS,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

01:08.735 --> 01:09.736
AND WHILE THERE ARE

01:09.736 --> 01:11.071
NUMEROUS PROBLEMS
WITH THE FOOD...

01:11.071 --> 01:13.615
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
AS BAD AS THIS.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.284
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
IS THAT JULIE...

01:15.284 --> 01:16.285
I THINK OUR FOOD'S GOOD.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.411
OH, COME ON.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.662
IS IN COMPLETE DENIAL.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.788
I'M STANDING BY MY FOOD.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.789
THIS OWNER MAY BE

01:20.789 --> 01:22.207
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THROUGH.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.252
THE WAY YOU'RE RUNNING
THIS PLACE IS INCORRECT.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.837
IT'S MY RESTAURANT.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.797
AND CHEF RAMSAY MAY BE STUCK
IN NEUTRAL

01:28.797 --> 01:30.000
IN WOODLAND PARK, COLORADO.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.340
IN WOODLAND PARK, COLORADO.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.050
WHY DOESN'T HE
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.260
GET READY FOR A BATTLE.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.178
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE
GREAT.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.346
IT'S CHEF RAMSAY
VERSUS OWNER JULIE.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.598
I'M LEAVING.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.890
<i>JULIE.</i>
<i>I CAN'T DO IT.</i>

01:38.890 --> 01:39.975
AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED

01:39.975 --> 01:40.976
HOW IT TURNS OUT.

01:40.976 --> 01:41.977
YOU'RE WALKING OUT?

01:41.977 --> 01:43.562
I'M WALKING OUT.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.065
WHAT IS THAT?

01:47.065 --> 01:48.734
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

01:48.734 --> 01:49.985
THEY'RE NOT CRAP,
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.611
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

01:52.821 --> 01:54.614
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.
GET OUT!

01:54.614 --> 01:56.325
THAT IS AMAZING.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.326
EMBARRASSING!

01:57.326 --> 01:58.910
OH, GOD!

01:58.910 --> 02:00.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.997
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.960
WOODLAND PARK, COLORADO.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.838
30 MINUTES
FROM COLORADO SPRINGS,

02:09.838 --> 02:12.341
IT'S KNOWN AS THE CITY
ABOVE THE CLOUDS,

02:12.341 --> 02:14.509
AND IT'S HOME TO MANGIA MANGIA,

02:14.509 --> 02:19.264
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT OWNED
BY FORMER REALTOR JULIE WATSON.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.766
HI, MANGIA MANGIA,
THIS IS JULIE.

02:20.766 --> 02:21.767
CAN I HELP YOU?

02:21.767 --> 02:23.727
WE GOT THE BUILDING.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.103
IT WAS A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT,

02:25.103 --> 02:27.773
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT CONCEPT
I WANTED TO DO.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.691
WOULD ANYONE LIKE
SOME CRACKED PEPPER?

02:29.691 --> 02:30.000
MY MOM DECIDED TO OPEN UP
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT

02:30.000 --> 02:31.318
MY MOM DECIDED TO OPEN UP
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT

02:31.318 --> 02:34.196
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T
ANY OTHER ITALIAN RESTAURANTS.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.031
THERE'S THREE MEXICAN
AND TWO CHINESE.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.449
YOU GUYS NEED TABLES.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.576
THIS IS THE ONLY
ITALIAN RESTAURANT

02:39.576 --> 02:41.995
IN WOODLAND PARK,
AND WE'VE BLOWN IT...

02:41.995 --> 02:43.955
COME ON, PEOPLE.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.374
BECAUSE JULIE
IS A POOR MANAGER.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.583
JUST DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE,
ANDREA.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.751
HOW'S THAT?

02:47.751 --> 02:49.378
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.213
I SAID TO USE PLATES.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.965
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO PLATE UP SPAGHETTI?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.052
THIS RESTAURANT RUNS LIKE
A JERRY SPRINGER SHOW.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.930
GET RID OF THIS.
AND WHAT'S IN THE WALK-IN?

02:59.930 --> 03:00.000
WE FIGHT A LOT.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.014
WE FIGHT A LOT.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.058
MY MOM HAS A TENDENCY
TO YELL...

03:03.058 --> 03:06.186
NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
MAKE A MEAT LASAGNA FOR TONIGHT!

03:06.186 --> 03:07.312
INSTEAD OF SOLVING
THE PROBLEM.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.272
THE NEXT  LASAGNA
I BRING BACK

03:09.272 --> 03:12.234
IS GOING UP YOUR.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.736
SHE GETS MAD, AND SHE--
YOU STAY OUT OF HER WAY.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.987
I'M JUST NOT
IN THE MOOD FOR IT.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.280
YOU KNOW, YOU SAY ANYTHING,

03:17.280 --> 03:18.782
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.409
IS SOMEONE HIDING?

03:20.409 --> 03:22.077
BECAUSE I JUST ORDERED
THREE DOZEN BOWLS.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.079
THE KING-OF-THE-WORLD ATTITUDE
THAT JULIE HAS

03:24.079 --> 03:26.081
CAUSES A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.416
TREVOR, THAT'S BURNED
TO A CRISP.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.417
WE HAVE TO START THAT OVER.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.459
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM

03:29.459 --> 03:30.000
IN THE RESTAURANT

03:30.000 --> 03:30.752
IN THE RESTAURANT

03:30.752 --> 03:32.504
IS MY HEAD CHEF, TREVOR,
WHO THINKS HE'S A GOD.

03:32.504 --> 03:36.466
I WANT IT DONE, AND IT BETTER
BE DONE BY 2:00.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.926
YOU, TREVOR.

03:37.926 --> 03:38.927
I HATE TREVOR.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.554
HE'S DISRESPECTFUL.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.347
HE'S JUST NOT
A VERY NICE PERSON.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.390
HE THROWS FITS.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.226
FOOT'S GOING IN.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.936
HE'S THROWN STUFF AT ME.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.188
HE'S MESSED FOOD UP
ON PURPOSE.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.690
THIS IS ALWAYS
A GOOD WAY TO CHECK.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.983
<i>EW.</i>

03:52.983 --> 03:54.234
HE'S WALKED OUT BEFORE.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.486
HERE, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

03:58.447 --> 03:59.698
I HAVE NEVER BEEN

03:59.698 --> 04:00.000
INTO A SIT-DOWN RESTAURANT

04:00.000 --> 04:01.199
INTO A SIT-DOWN RESTAURANT

04:01.199 --> 04:02.367
WITH A DRIVE-THROUGH WINDOW.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.202
HI, THERE.
HOW ARE YOU?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.037
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.789
A DRIVE-THROUGH SCREAMS
FAST FOOD,

04:07.789 --> 04:11.668
AND NOT JUST CASUAL,
FINE DINING RESTAURANT.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.754
WOW, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

04:14.754 --> 04:18.258
THE FOOD ISN'T COOKED
WITH MUCH LOVE.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.969
IT'S COOKED WITH STRESS
AND A MICROWAVE.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.430
<i>WHERE IS MY OTHER LASAGNA?</i>

04:23.430 --> 04:26.057
IT'S IN THE MICROWAVE.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.726
THERE'S, LIKE,
NO TASTE TO IT.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.000
THAT ONE TABLE
BITCHED SO MUCH,

04:30.000 --> 04:30.604
THAT ONE TABLE
BITCHED SO MUCH,

04:30.604 --> 04:32.856
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH THEM.

04:32.856 --> 04:36.693
I HAVE HAD MORE PEOPLE TELL ME
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME

04:36.693 --> 04:38.570
THAN EVER IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.031
IT'S LIKE OPEN FIELD DAY
ON JULIE.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.240
I'VE REACHED MY BREAKING POINT.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.994
I'M STRESSED
AND CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.162
DEEP BREATH.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.538
IF THIS RESTAURANT GOES
OUT OF BUSINESS,

04:48.538 --> 04:50.123
I WILL LOSE EVERYTHING.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.667
I HAVE PUT ALL MY MONEY
INTO THIS RESTAURANT.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.086
HAVING CHEF RAMSAY HERE
IS THE LAST RESORT.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.644
WOW, HERE WE ARE.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.479
<i>WAIT, HOLD ON A MINUTE.</i>

05:12.479 --> 05:14.356
GO TO THE WINDOW.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.440
<i>THIS LOOKS LIKE</i>

05:15.440 --> 05:18.985
A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.988
THIS HAS TO BE A FIRST.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.698
HE'S HERE.
I SEE HIM.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.617
JANELLE, JUST CHILL.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.702
I WONDER IF THEY HAVE
TABLES INSIDE.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.745
HI.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.000
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

05:30.000 --> 05:30.121
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.248
VERY WELL, THANK YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.332
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST NAME?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.543
JANELLE.
JANELLE. OKAY, GREAT.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.710
OKAY, LET'S GET ONE THING RIGHT.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.003
YOU DO HAVE TABLES INSIDE,
RIGHT?
YEAH.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.630
OKAY, GREAT,
AND THE DRIVE-THROUGH,

05:38.630 --> 05:39.923
WHY IS THAT HERE?

05:39.923 --> 05:41.258
NORMALLY, PEOPLE CALL IN
THEIR ORDER,

05:41.258 --> 05:42.509
AND THEN THEY PICK IT UP.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.929
SO, ON AVERAGE, HOW MANY GUESTS
DRIVE BY A DAY?

05:45.929 --> 05:48.181
MAYBE, LIKE, ONE OR TWO.
SO I'M THE ONE OF THE DAY.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.976
YES, YOU'RE THE ONE.
WOW. WELL, LET'S MAKE
THIS QUICK.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.018
SOUP OF THE DAY IS WHAT?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.478
IT'S CHICKEN AND WILD RICE.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.480
LET'S HAVE A, UM,
CHICKEN AND WILD RICE.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.731
OKAY.
THANKS, DARLING.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.316
<i>MM-HMM.</i>

05:58.316 --> 05:59.401
WOW.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.000
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME
DO THIS, MOM?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.820
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME
DO THIS, MOM?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.071
JANELLE, STOP.

06:03.071 --> 06:03.989
WHAT, SHOULD I JUST DO SOUP

06:03.989 --> 06:05.407
HOW WE NORMALLY DO,
IN THE--

06:05.407 --> 06:07.367
<i>YEP, JUST DO IT</i>
<i>LIKE WE NORMALLY DO IT.</i>

06:07.367 --> 06:10.120
LET'S SEE HOW QUICK THEY ARE.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.330
VERY NERVE-RACKING.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.044
HE'S GONNA NEED A SPOON.
I KNOW, MOM.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.340
<i>HEY, JANELLEY, DON'T FORGET</i>
<i>TO TAPE THE TOP.</i>

06:22.340 --> 06:24.843
I'M GOING TO TAPE THE TOP.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.000
THIS IS SUPER FRUSTRATING.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.974
THIS IS SUPER FRUSTRATING.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.561
JUST WANT THIS TO BE OVER.

06:38.773 --> 06:42.736
UGH.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.446
WHERE'D HE GO?

06:44.446 --> 06:45.614
OH.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.157
OH, THAT'S MY SOUP.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.867
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:48.867 --> 06:52.162
WOW, A <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES</i> FIRST.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.705
HE SMELLS REALLY GOOD.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.207
<i>A DRIVE-THROUGH</i>
<i>ITALIAN RESTAURANT.</i>

06:56.207 --> 06:57.542
IT'S HILARIOUS.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.544
HE HAS AN ADORABLE ACCENT.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.000
YES, HE DOES HAVE
AN ADORABLE ACCENT.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.171
YES, HE DOES HAVE
AN ADORABLE ACCENT.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.675
WOW.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.761
THAT IS IT.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.389
THAT IS IT.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.891
WOW.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.226
IT DOESN'T LOOK
VERY APPETIZING.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.438
AND A...

07:18.438 --> 07:20.065
KNIFE AND FORK.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.275
NO SPOON...

07:22.275 --> 07:24.110
TO EAT MY SOUP.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.737
MIND YOU, IT IS
ACTUALLY THICK ENOUGH

07:25.737 --> 07:29.908
TO EAT THE SOUP WITH A FORK.

07:29.908 --> 07:30.000
YOU FORGOT TO GIVE HIM
HIS SPOON.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.201
YOU FORGOT TO GIVE HIM
HIS SPOON.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.328
<i>HOW'S HE SUPPOSED TO EAT</i>
<i>HIS SOUP?</i>

07:33.328 --> 07:34.746
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME A SPOON.
I GAVE YOU A SPOON.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.998
NO, YOU DIDN'T HAND IT
TO ME.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.958
TRUST ME.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.168
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN THE DRIVE-THROUGH BUSINESS,

07:40.168 --> 07:42.212
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU COULD GIVE ME A SPOON,

07:42.212 --> 07:44.255
AND SECONDLY, YOU COULD AT LEAST
FILL MY CUP.

07:44.255 --> 07:48.259
BUT THIS IS...

07:48.259 --> 07:50.303
IT'S PRETTY HORRIFIC.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.139
UGH.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.141
WOW.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.352
OH,.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.395
HELLO.
<i>HI.</i>

07:58.395 --> 07:59.771
HOW ARE YOU?
<i>I'M JULIE WATSON.</i>

07:59.771 --> 08:00.000
JULIE, NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.231
JULIE, NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.524
AND YOU ARE THE--
I'M THE OWNER.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.858
THE OWNER.
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.026
<i>THAT'S A FIRST FOR ME.</i>

08:05.026 --> 08:06.361
A DRIVE-THROUGH...

08:06.361 --> 08:08.029
PICK-UP IN AN ITALIAN
RESTAURANT.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.115
WASN'T THAT GREAT?
THE SOUP WASN'T.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.157
OH, THE SOUP WASN'T GOOD?
NO.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.701
OH, I'M SORRY.
JUST THICK AND BLAND AND--

08:12.701 --> 08:15.161
I'M SORRY.
SO LET'S CATCH UP, SHALL WE?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.705
OKAY.
YEAH?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.415
WHAT'S ALL THESE
LITTLE FRILLY CURTAINS?

08:18.415 --> 08:21.042
<i>PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT</i>
<i>THAT THE BOOTHS WERE DOWN,</i>

08:21.042 --> 08:22.085
AND SO THEY ASKED ME
TO RAISE THE BOOTHS,

08:22.085 --> 08:23.420
AND THAT'S HOW WE RAISED THEM.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.004
<i>OH, BY CURTAINS.</i>

08:25.004 --> 08:26.005
RIGHT, HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.173
EXCELLENT.
SO WHAT WAS THE PLAN

08:27.173 --> 08:28.466
OPENING THIS PLACE?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.884
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
A CHAIN RESTAURANT.

08:29.884 --> 08:30.000
IT WAS A CHAIN RESTAURANT.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.010
IT WAS A CHAIN RESTAURANT.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.138
NO, IT LOOKS LIKE IT NOW.
STILL?

08:33.138 --> 08:34.931
<i>IT DOESN'T RESEMBLE</i>
<i>A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT FOR YOU?</i>

08:34.931 --> 08:37.183
WELL, KIND OF,
BUT NOT THAT BAD.
RIGHT.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.103
<i>I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ITALIAN</i>
<i>IN HERE WHATSOEVER.</i>

08:40.103 --> 08:41.104
REALLY?

08:41.104 --> 08:43.148
YEAH, REALLY.
I THINK IT'S CUTE.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.774
OKAY, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE IN ITALY?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.735
NEVER.
AH, OKAY.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.736
I'M IRISH.

08:47.736 --> 08:48.737
<i>OKAY.</i>

08:48.737 --> 08:50.071
IS THAT ALL FAKE?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.448
ARE THEY CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS
AS WELL ON THE TOP--

08:51.448 --> 08:52.741
YES, IT IS.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.200
<i>AND WE'RE IN AUGUST.</i>

08:54.200 --> 08:55.076
NO, BUT THAT'S LIGHT.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.120
IT GIVES LIGHT INTO THE DARK.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.079
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.414
<i>WHICH PART IS</i>
<i>BEAUTIFUL FOR YOU?</i>

08:59.414 --> 09:00.000
THE FAKE FLOWERS
OR THE CURTAINS?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.917
THE FAKE FLOWERS
OR THE CURTAINS?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.377
YOU'RE JUST NOT GONNA
LET THAT GO, ARE YA?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.837
<i>WELL, I'M JUST--</i>
HOLY.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.547
I'M JUST CURIOUS, THAT'S ALL.
IT'S, UH--

09:07.547 --> 09:10.133
OH, ,
YOU'RE MAKING ME LAUGH.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.760
WHY ITALIAN CUISINE, THEN?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.720
I OPENED
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT

09:13.720 --> 09:15.096
<i>BECAUSE PEOPLE</i>
<i>IN WOODLAND PARK SAID,</i>

09:15.096 --> 09:17.140
<i>"THERE'S NO ITALIAN.</i>
<i>OPEN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT."</i>

09:17.140 --> 09:18.641
AND SO I OPENED
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.768
<i>RIGHT.</i>

09:19.768 --> 09:21.019
YOU MUST HAVE SOME
GOOD STAFF, SURELY.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.021
I DO.
<i>SO WHO ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS?</i>

09:23.021 --> 09:24.856
<i>ANDREA IS A GREAT WAITRESS.</i>

09:24.856 --> 09:26.357
MY DAUGHTER, JANELLE.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.901
OH, JANELLE, WHO--
THE ONE WHO FORGOT...

09:27.901 --> 09:29.069
THE WINDOW--
TO GIVE ME A
SPOON FOR THE SOUP.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.000
YEAH, THE ONE THAT FORGOT
TO GIVE YOU THE SPOON.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.195
YEAH, THE ONE THAT FORGOT
TO GIVE YOU THE SPOON.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.654
<i>UM, I HAVE--</i>

09:31.654 --> 09:32.864
KEVIN'S GREAT.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.032
<i>HE'S ONE OF MY COOKS.</i>

09:34.032 --> 09:35.742
<i>RIGHT.</i>

09:35.742 --> 09:37.202
PROBLEMS. WHAT ARE THEY?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.453
<i>I THINK OUR FOOD'S GREAT,</i>

09:38.453 --> 09:41.372
BUT I HAVE A COOK
THAT HAS WORKED WITH ME

09:41.372 --> 09:43.666
SINCE THE DAY I OPENED,

09:43.666 --> 09:44.667
AND HE HAS AN ATTITUDE.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.169
RIGHT.
BUT I HAVEN'T

09:46.169 --> 09:48.088
FIRED HIM BECAUSE
IT'S HARD

09:48.088 --> 09:49.631
TO GET HELP UP HERE
IN WOODLAND PARK.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.799
IT IS.
REALLY?

09:50.799 --> 09:51.841
YES, IT IS.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.967
WHO MAINTAINS
THE STANDARDS HERE?

09:52.967 --> 09:55.095
ME. THE BUCK STOPS HERE.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.304
RIGHT, BUT YOU JUST CONFIRMED

09:56.304 --> 09:57.931
YOU'VE KEPT THE WRONG CHEF
FOR FOUR YEARS.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.682
BUT HE SHOWS UP.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.000
90% OF THE TIME, HE DOES
WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.893
90% OF THE TIME, HE DOES
WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.061
OKAY.
BUT 10% OF THE TIME,

10:03.061 --> 10:04.562
HE'S A.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.106
AND WHICH RESTAURANT
DID HE COME FROM?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.983
HE'S NEVER WORKED
IN A RESTAURANT.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.527
<i>SO HE HAD NO BACKGROUND</i>
<i>AND TRAINING?</i>

10:10.527 --> 10:12.987
EXACTLY.
SO HOW DID HE START?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.030
HE WOULD START
WASHING DISHES.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.490
OKAY, AND DOES HE GET ON

10:15.490 --> 10:16.699
WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM,
THE FRONT OF HOUSE STAFF?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.034
NO.
HE DOESN'T?

10:18.034 --> 10:19.327
NO, HE MAKES THEM CRAZY.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.578
<i>WHAT DO THE SERVERS</i>
<i>THINK OF HIM?</i>

10:20.578 --> 10:22.372
THEY THINK HE'S AN.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.706
IF HE GETS PISSED OFF,

10:23.706 --> 10:25.041
HE'LL WALK OUT THE BACK DOOR
AND SIT AND SMOKE.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.251
IN THE MIDDLE OF SERVICE?
YEAH.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.627
WHAT?
YES.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.670
WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM,
THE ATTITUDE?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.000
BECAUSE HE THINKS HE'S A GOD.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.046
BECAUSE HE THINKS HE'S A GOD.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.048
<i>HE'S SEEN THE PARADE OF PEOPLE</i>

10:32.048 --> 10:33.299
THAT I'VE HAD
THROUGH THIS RESTAURANT.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.300
OKAY, SO HE'S PUT YOU
OVER A BARREL.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.802
AND SO HE'S--
YEAH, EXACTLY.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.012
HE KNOWS THAT I CAN'T FIRE HIM
BECAUSE I HAVE NO ONE ELSE.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.013
HOW OLD IS HE?

10:39.013 --> 10:41.432
22.
HE'S 22?

10:41.432 --> 10:43.059
YES.
I MEAN,

10:43.059 --> 10:44.519
AT 22 YEARS OF AGE, HE SHOULDN'T
BE RUNNING THE KITCHEN.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.355
BUT SOMEHOW,
THE FOOD TURNS OUT GOOD?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.773
IT DOES TURN OUT GOOD.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.108
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

10:50.108 --> 10:52.527
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T CHANGED
ANYTHING FOR FOUR YEARS.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.028
OKAY, WELL, WE'LL SEE.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.238
PROVE IT TO ME TONIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.365
SHOW ME AROUND, PLEASE.
OKAY.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.784
EXCELLENT.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.000
THE GREAT WALL
OF WOODLAND PARK.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.785
THE GREAT WALL
OF WOODLAND PARK.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.995
<i>YES.</i>

11:01.995 --> 11:03.872
<i>I LOVE MY WALL.</i>
<i>DON'T MAKE FUN OF MY WALL.</i>

11:03.872 --> 11:05.999
GOOD. NO, NO, IT'S--
IT'S HIDEOUS.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.125
<i>LADIES, HOW ARE WE?</i>

11:07.125 --> 11:08.334
GOOD, THANK YOU.
THIS IS ANDREA.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.627
ANDREA. OKAY, GREAT.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.172
<i>UH, YOUNG MAN, COME OVER.</i>

11:12.172 --> 11:13.339
HOW ARE YOU, BUDDY?

11:13.339 --> 11:14.591
TREVOR PETERSON.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.009
TREVOR PETERSON. OKAY.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.428
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?
I'M THE HEAD CHEF.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.263
SO YOU'RE THE YOUNG
22-YEAR-OLD

11:20.263 --> 11:22.932
THAT 90% IS GOOD
AND 10% IS A?

11:22.932 --> 11:23.933
YEAH.
OKAY.

11:23.933 --> 11:24.934
OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.144
WHICHEVER WAY YOU WANT
TO LOOK AT IT.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.478
NO, I'M JUST GOING OFF
WHAT THE OWNER SAID.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.105
<i>HOW DO YOU RATE THE FOOD,</i>
<i>OUT OF TEN?</i>

11:29.105 --> 11:30.000
FIVE.
F--OH.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.940
FIVE.
F--OH.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.108
THAT'S YOUR OWN FOOD,
TREVOR.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.193
WOW.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.277
<i>AND I WOULD GIVE IT</i>

11:34.277 --> 11:37.488
<i>A 50/50</i>
<i>ON TREVOR'S BEHAVIOR.</i>

11:37.488 --> 11:39.073
AND WHERE DOES THIS
STEM FROM?

11:39.073 --> 11:39.991
DID WE FALL OUT?

11:39.991 --> 11:41.117
<i>WE WERE DATING</i>
<i>BACK IN THE DAY,</i>

11:41.117 --> 11:42.160
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.244
RIGHT.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.871
MIGHT EVEN BE A 40/60,

11:44.871 --> 11:45.997
ON THE BAD SIDE.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.207
SERIOUSLY?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.666
YOU MAKE ME THAT MAD.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.627
YOU WERE CAUGHT
TRYING TO PUNCH ME.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.628
WHOA, WHOA, HOLD UP, NOW.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.004
<i>JANELLE--</i>

11:53.004 --> 11:55.423
JANELLE, COME OVER HERE,
MY DARLING, PLEASE.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.717
THIS YOUNG MAN
TRIED TO PUNCH YOU?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.135
YEAH, HE PUSHED ME
INTO THE WALK-IN

11:59.135 --> 12:00.000
AND TRIED TO PUNCH ME,

12:00.000 --> 12:00.220
AND TRIED TO PUNCH ME,

12:00.220 --> 12:01.846
<i>AND WHEN I TOLD HIM</i>
<i>I WAS GONNA CALL THE COPS--</i>

12:01.846 --> 12:02.847
WHEN?

12:02.847 --> 12:04.390
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.100
IS THAT REAL?
I DIDN'T--

12:06.100 --> 12:07.727
IT'S SOMEWHAT REAL, YEAH.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.062
SO YOU GRAB HER,

12:09.062 --> 12:10.480
<i>THREATEN TO PUNCH HER,</i>

12:10.480 --> 12:12.232
AND PUSH HER
INTO THE WALK-IN?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.108
AFTER SHE TELLS ME NO ONE CARES
IF I GET FIRED,

12:14.108 --> 12:15.276
NO ONE CARES ABOUT MY
WELL-BEING,

12:15.276 --> 12:16.778
NO ONE CARES ABOUT ME,
NO ONE GIVES A  ABOUT ME.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.572
IT'S TRUE, THOUGH.
NO ONE LIKES YOU.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.824
COMING UP...

12:21.824 --> 12:23.159
WE GOT A  PROBLEM.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.702
JULIE IS ON THE WARPATH

12:24.702 --> 12:26.246
AS CHEF RAMSAY
TRIES THE FOOD.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.872
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST
LEAVE IT ALONE?

12:27.872 --> 12:28.873
THEN...

12:28.873 --> 12:30.000
<i>ENOUGH PASTA</i>

12:30.000 --> 12:30.041
<i>ENOUGH PASTA</i>

12:30.041 --> 12:32.043
FOR CLOSE TO 400 PORTIONS.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.545
IT'S A DISCOVERY
UNLIKE ANY OTHER.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.964
WHAT FRUITCAKE'S
OPERATING THIS?

12:35.964 --> 12:37.131
AND CHEF RAMSAY

12:37.131 --> 12:38.716
MAY BE READY
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.052
I'M GONNA DRIVE STRAIGHT BACK
TO THE  AIRPORT.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.512
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.972
I'M NOT TAKING
ANY MORE  TABLES.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.390
WHAT?
YOU'RE WALKING OUT?

12:45.390 --> 12:47.392
I'M WALKING OUT.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.273
CHEF RAMSAY
HAS ALREADY WITNESSED

12:55.273 --> 12:57.025
SOME MINOR PROBLEMS
LIKE THE DECOR,

12:57.025 --> 12:59.820
AND SOME MAJOR PROBLEMS
LIKE THE SERIOUS TENSION

12:59.820 --> 13:02.614
BETWEEN THE OWNER'S DAUGHTER
AND THE HEAD CHEF.

13:02.614 --> 13:06.076
HE'S HOPING THAT HE CAN FIND
SOME POSITIVITY IN THE FOOD.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.494
HOW ARE YOU, DARLING?
GOOD, THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU?

13:07.494 --> 13:08.495
ANDREA, RIGHT?
YES.

13:08.495 --> 13:09.704
I TASTED THAT SOUP.

13:09.704 --> 13:12.499
I FELT LIKE GOING STRAIGHT
BACK TO THE AIRPORT.

13:12.499 --> 13:13.500
OKAY, MY DARLING,
LET'S ORDER, SHALL WE?

13:13.500 --> 13:14.793
OKAY.
UM, RIGHT.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.129
LET'S GO FOR THE WILD MUSHROOM
RAVIOLI, PLEASE.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.172
<i>VEAL PICATTA,</i>
<i>AND, UM--</i>

13:19.172 --> 13:20.465
WHERE DID I SEE IT?
THE FRESH PACIFIC SALMON.

13:20.465 --> 13:20.895
OKAY.

13:20.895 --> 13:21.842
OKAY.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.051
MAMA'S OWN MEAT LASAGNA
AS WELL,

13:23.051 --> 13:25.262
AND I'VE GOTTA GO
FOR THE MEATBALLS.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.263
<i>I THINK WE'RE DONE,</i>
<i>MY DARLING.</i>

13:26.263 --> 13:27.264
WOW. THANK YOU.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.516
OF COURSE.

13:29.516 --> 13:34.187
HERE'S HIS ORDERS.

13:34.187 --> 13:36.815
GOT A GOOD MIX.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.942
IS THAT FOR GORDON?

13:38.942 --> 13:40.777
<i>JULIE, YOU'RE IN THE WAY,</i>

13:40.777 --> 13:42.404

I THINK OUR FOOD IS
STILL VERY GOOD.

13:50.895 --> 13:51.788
I THINK OUR FOOD IS
STILL VERY GOOD.

13:51.788 --> 13:53.290
MUSHROOM RAVIOLI.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.293
MUSHROOM RAVIOLIS.
AND WHAT'S THE SAUCE?

13:56.293 --> 13:57.752
IT'S AN ALFREDO SAUCE.

13:57.752 --> 13:59.629
AND CAN YOU ASK THE CHEF WHEN HE
MADE THE RAVIOLIS, PLEASE?

13:59.629 --> 14:01.172

I DON'T THINK SO.

14:16.813 --> 14:19.065
THEY'RE FROZEN,
AND THEY WERE JUST MADE.

14:19.065 --> 14:20.358
SO IT'S STORE-BOUGHT.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.173
I HAVE NOT.
DO YOU KNOW HOW?

14:43.173 --> 14:44.633
NO, HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.846
HE'S NEVER MADE THEM,

GREAT.

15:50.895 --> 15:51.282
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE
GREAT.

15:51.282 --> 15:53.952
A CHEF THAT DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE PASTA?

15:53.952 --> 15:56.538
AND YOU'RE THE HEAD CHEF
OF AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT?

15:56.538 --> 15:58.081
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

16:15.432 --> 16:19.686
WELL, THAT WAS MY FIRST TRY.
BEAR WITH ME.

16:19.686 --> 16:20.895
TREVOR IS WAY
OUT OF HIS LEAGUE RIGHT NOW.

16:20.895 --> 16:21.354
TREVOR IS WAY
OUT OF HIS LEAGUE RIGHT NOW.

16:21.354 --> 16:23.940
HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S DOING.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.984
THAT GUY'S AN IDIOT.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.569
HERE'S YOUR MEAT LASAGNA.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.181
HE JUST WANTS YOU GUYS TO CLEAN
THE EDGES OF THE PLATE.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.348
THERE'S FINGERPRINTS.

16:57.348 --> 16:58.349
THERE'S A REALLY BAD ONE

16:58.349 --> 16:59.642
AND THERE'S SOME MORE HERE.

16:59.642 --> 17:01.394
<i>AND HE SAID TO MAKE SURE</i>

17:33.635 --> 17:35.720
YIKES. IT'S COLD.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.979
DISGUSTING.

17:44.979 --> 17:48.274
CHEF WOULD LIKE YOU GUYS

17:48.274 --> 17:50.527
IT'S COLD.

17:50.527 --> 17:50.895

17:50.895 --> 17:52.529
THAT  LASAGNA'S COLD.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.738
JULIE, IT'S THE MICROWAVE.

17:53.738 --> 17:54.989
I TOLD YOU NOT TO USE
THAT MICROWAVE.

17:54.989 --> 17:57.158
USE THE ONE IN THE BACK,
I SAID.

17:57.158 --> 17:58.201
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

17:58.201 --> 17:59.244
<i>I GUARANTEE IT.</i>

17:59.244 --> 18:01.913
I SAID TO USE THE ONE
IN THE BACK

18:01.913 --> 18:04.332
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
THIS  TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

18:04.332 --> 18:05.375
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.292
IT'S A MICROWAVE.

18:06.292 --> 18:07.544
THEN WHY, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
DID IT CHANGE,

18:07.544 --> 18:09.254
<i>AFTER FOUR  YEARS?</i>

18:09.254 --> 18:10.255
THAT'S.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.256
I SAID DON'T USE IT.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.508
OKAY, JULIE.

18:13.508 --> 18:15.510
JULIE'S IN DENIAL
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

18:15.510 --> 18:18.138
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
SHE WON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.348
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO
FINGERPRINTS.

18:25.645 --> 18:27.355
HERE'S YOUR SPAGHETTI
WITH MEATBALLS.

18:27.355 --> 18:30.191
THANK YOU, MY DARLING.
AND ARE THE MEATBALLS HOMEMADE?

18:30.191 --> 18:31.151
<i>NO, THEY'RE FROZEN.</i>

18:31.151 --> 18:33.194
OH, COME ON.

18:33.194 --> 18:34.737
SERIOUS?

18:34.737 --> 18:35.864
DOES HE KNOW HOW TO MAKE
A MEATBALL?

18:35.864 --> 18:37.490
<i>HE DOES KNOW HOW TO MAKE</i>
<i>A MEATBALL.</i>

18:37.490 --> 18:39.367
OH, OKAY, GREAT.
SO WHY DOESN'T HE DO THEM?

18:39.367 --> 18:41.828
UM, I BELIEVE THAT
THEY USED TO DO THEM,

18:41.828 --> 18:43.371
AND THEY FELL APART
TOO MUCH BEFORE.

18:43.371 --> 18:45.373
THAT MEANS HE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE THEM.

18:45.373 --> 18:46.875
HE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE THEM RIGHT.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.209
<i>WOW.</i>

18:48.209 --> 18:49.627
ASK THE CHEF WHY
HE CAN'T MAKE A MEATBALL.

18:49.627 --> 18:50.670
OKAY.
<i>PLEASE.</i>

18:50.670 --> 18:50.895

WOW, THE MEATBALLS
TASTE LIKE...

18:57.343 --> 18:59.846
WARM FOAM.

18:59.846 --> 19:03.391
TREVOR, CHEF WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHY

19:03.391 --> 19:04.726
OUR MEATBALLS
WOULD FALL APART.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.352
WHY WOULD YOU NOT BE ABLE
TO MAKE A MEATBALL?

19:06.352 --> 19:07.770
I TOLD HIM THE REASON
WE STOPPED SERVING THEM

19:07.770 --> 19:09.230
IS 'CAUSE THEY FELL APART.

19:09.230 --> 19:11.232
THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL CHEF.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

19:11.232 --> 19:13.318
THAT WAS PUTTING WORDS
IN MY MOUTH, THANK YOU.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.319
<i>I WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK</i>

19:14.319 --> 19:16.279
TO MAKING HANDMADE MEATBALLS.

19:16.279 --> 19:17.238
OKAY.

19:17.238 --> 19:18.448
THAT'S.

19:19.908 --> 19:20.895
<i>TREVOR, I CAN'T GET YOU</i>

19:20.895 --> 19:21.284
<i>TREVOR, I CAN'T GET YOU</i>

AND YOU WANT TO MAKE MEATBALLS?

19:23.411 --> 19:25.038
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.623
HA, HA.
KISS MY ASS.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.166
YOU DON'T WANNA PAY ANYBODY
TO DO ANYTHING.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.126
<i>I HAVE TO BEG YOU TO COME</i>
<i>TO WORK IN THE DAY.</i>

19:30.126 --> 19:32.504
I CAN'T EVEN PUT YOU ON DAYS
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SHOW UP.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.588
<i>DO YOU THINK I WANT TO COME</i>

19:33.588 --> 19:35.256
BACK HERE
AND TRY TO HANDLE

19:35.256 --> 19:36.257
<i>A WHOLE  KITCHEN?</i>

19:36.257 --> 19:37.258
YOU DON'T HANDLE THIS KITCHEN.

19:37.258 --> 19:38.218
I HANDLE THIS  KITCHEN,

19:38.218 --> 19:40.178
BECAUSE YOU REFUSE
TO DO ANYTHING.

19:40.178 --> 19:43.014
<i>I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.</i>

19:43.014 --> 19:44.265
<i>YOU ASKED FOR THIS JOB.</i>

19:44.265 --> 19:46.768
YOU ALWAYS WALK AROUND SAYING,
"I'M THE HEAD CHEF."

19:46.768 --> 19:48.311
<i>I DIDN'T ASK YOU.</i>

19:48.311 --> 19:49.812
GOD.

19:49.812 --> 19:50.895
<i>NOW DO YOU SEE WHY</i>
<i>NO ONE LIKES YOU?</i>

19:50.895 --> 19:53.149
<i>NOW DO YOU SEE WHY</i>
<i>NO ONE LIKES YOU?</i>

19:53.149 --> 19:54.776
YOU CAN SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.444
OH, I'M SCARED.

19:56.444 --> 19:58.863
TREVOR SAYS IT WAS
THE ORIGINAL CHEF'S MEATBALLS

19:58.863 --> 20:00.156
THAT FELL APART.

20:00.156 --> 20:01.407
HE'S NEVER MADE
THE MEATBALLS HERE.

20:01.407 --> 20:02.825
OKAY, SO--

20:02.825 --> 20:04.369
HE KNOWS HOW, HE SAYS.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.663
WOW, YEAH, THAT'S, UH,
DREADFUL TEXTURE.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.581
MEATBALLS TASTE FROZEN,
AND THAT MARINARA,

20:08.581 --> 20:10.208
IF YOU JUST TIP THE PLATE
TO THE SIDE--

20:10.208 --> 20:12.126
I'LL ACTUALLY SHOW YOU--
IT'S JUST FULL OF WATER.

20:12.126 --> 20:14.420
I DIDN'T EXPECT
A WATERY MARINARA.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.089
AND THE SPAGHETTI'S
NOT EVEN GLAZED.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.715
IT'S JUST BLAND.
OKAY.

20:17.715 --> 20:19.676
THANK YOU.

20:19.676 --> 20:20.895
<i>NOW WHAT?</i>

20:20.895 --> 20:21.010
<i>NOW WHAT?</i>

IT'S BLAND.
THE MARINARA'S WATERY.

20:25.723 --> 20:27.850
THE MEATBALLS, YOU CAN TASTE
THEY'RE FROZEN.

20:27.850 --> 20:29.477

20:29.477 --> 20:31.145
WELL--
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU--

20:31.145 --> 20:33.314
THE SPAGHETTI IS BLAND.

20:33.314 --> 20:34.857
THE MARINARA IS WATERY.

20:34.857 --> 20:37.860
AND HE CAN TELL
THE MEATBALLS ARE FROZEN.

20:42.490 --> 20:43.616
I DON'T THINK
IT WAS THAT BAD.

20:43.616 --> 20:45.660
<i>I DON'T.</i>

20:45.660 --> 20:48.496
I THINK IT'S FINE.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.346
YES, IT'S ALL STILL RAW.

21:05.346 --> 21:07.348

IT WON'T EVEN CUT, SO--

21:07.348 --> 21:11.603
I'M STILL SCRAPING IT.
IT'S THAT RAW.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.313
IT'S NOT EVEN HOT.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.607
I DON'T MIND IT BEING PINK,
BUT IT'S RAW.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.358

I MEAN, I KNOW IT JUST NEEDS
TO BE KISSED IN THE PAN,

21:24.032 --> 21:25.908
BUT IT WAS THAT THICK.

21:25.908 --> 21:27.994
RAW IN THE MIDDLE.

21:27.994 --> 21:29.954
THE VEAL IS STILL RAW.

AND COULD YOU ASK
THE CHEF TO JUST SHOW ME

22:00.276 --> 22:01.861
HE THREW IT AWAY?

22:01.861 --> 22:03.446
HE DID.
WHY?

22:03.446 --> 22:06.491
I HAVE NO IDEA.
HE DID IT EARLIER, I GUESS.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.492

YES.

22:21.005 --> 22:22.632
<i>IS THE SALMON FRESH?</i>

22:22.632 --> 22:25.301
I BELIEVE IT'S FROZEN

22:25.301 --> 22:26.552
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
MM-MM.

22:26.552 --> 22:27.804
IT SAYS "FRESH" ON THE MENU.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.138
IT SAYS "FRESH"
ON THE MENU.

22:29.138 --> 22:32.475
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
FRESH PACIFIC SALMON.

GOOD GOD.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.358
I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT'S TERRIBLE.

22:40.358 --> 22:41.526
THE MASH TASTES WEIRD.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.194
IT TASTES WEIRD?
DO YOU MIND?

22:43.194 --> 22:44.904
NO.

22:44.904 --> 22:48.491
IT JUST--IT JUST--

22:48.491 --> 22:50.895
IT JUST TASTES OLD.
WHEN WERE THEY MADE?

22:50.895 --> 22:50.910
IT JUST TASTES OLD.
WHEN WERE THEY MADE?

22:50.910 --> 22:52.286
I'LL GO FIND OUT.
WOULD YOU MIND?

22:52.286 --> 22:54.497
PLEASE, DARLING.
THANK YOU.

22:54.497 --> 22:56.916
WHEN WERE THE POTATOES MADE,
AND BY WHOM?

22:56.916 --> 22:58.084
ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?

22:58.084 --> 22:59.085
<i>WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?</i>

22:59.085 --> 23:00.503
THE MASHED POTATOES
TASTE OLD.

23:00.503 --> 23:02.171
THEY JUST MADE THEM
LAST  NIGHT.

23:02.171 --> 23:03.172
<i>THEY WERE MADE LAST NIGHT.</i>

23:03.172 --> 23:04.173
OKAY.

23:04.173 --> 23:06.134
THAT'S.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.052
THIS IS
STRESSING ME OUT, MAN.

23:08.052 --> 23:10.346
CHEF RAMSAY
LIKED NOTHING TODAY.

23:10.346 --> 23:11.889
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED,

23:11.889 --> 23:13.099
AND I'M COMPLETELY SHOCKED.

23:13.099 --> 23:14.934
THAT'S.

23:14.934 --> 23:16.602
<i>THERE'S NOTHING WRONG</i>
<i>WITH THAT SALMON.</i>

23:16.602 --> 23:19.105
AND THOSE POTATOES WERE MADE
LAST  NIGHT.

23:19.105 --> 23:20.440
SO THAT'S.

23:20.440 --> 23:20.895
I LOVE MY FOOD.

23:20.895 --> 23:21.566
I LOVE MY FOOD.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.192
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST
LEAVE IT ALONE?

23:23.192 --> 23:25.194
WE GOT A  PROBLEM.

23:32.117 --> 23:33.827
LUNCH WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER,

23:33.827 --> 23:36.830
AS CHEF RAMSAY DISCOVERED
ISSUE AFTER ISSUE.

23:36.830 --> 23:37.956
WOW.

23:37.956 --> 23:39.166
IT'S NOW APPARENT TO HIM

23:39.166 --> 23:42.252
WHY THIS, THE ONLY ITALIAN
RESTAURANT IN TOWN,

23:42.252 --> 23:44.087
IS STRUGGLING SO MUCH.

23:44.087 --> 23:45.589
UH, LET'S GET THE TEAM OUT.

23:45.589 --> 23:47.299
<i>LET'S HAVE A CHAT.</i>

EVERYBODY, COME.

23:51.762 --> 23:53.597
UH, SO I'M--

23:53.597 --> 23:55.474
<i>I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START.</i>

23:55.474 --> 23:58.310
HAS ANYONE GOT
AN OUNCE OF TRAINING?

23:58.310 --> 23:58.949
I PERSONALLY DON'T.

23:58.949 --> 23:59.311
I PERSONALLY DON'T.

23:59.311 --> 24:01.480
<i>THE FIRST QUESTION</i>
<i>I ASKED ANDY WAS,</i>

24:01.480 --> 24:02.939
DOES THE CHEF MAKE PASTA?

24:02.939 --> 24:04.191
I DON'T--

24:04.191 --> 24:05.525
HOW BAD DOES THAT SOUND,
WHEN WE'RE STANDING

24:05.525 --> 24:08.445
INSIDE AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT
THAT YOU'RE THE HEAD COOK OF?

24:08.445 --> 24:09.988
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN
MAKE A  MEATBALL,

24:09.988 --> 24:12.199
<i>THAT SCARES THE</i>
<i>OUT OF ME.</i>

24:12.199 --> 24:14.284
UH, MY INTEREST HAS DWINDLED.

24:14.284 --> 24:16.995
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THE INTEREST,

24:16.995 --> 24:19.414
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING
THE JACKET ON.

24:19.414 --> 24:22.042
<i>I MEAN, IS ANYTHING FRESH?</i>

24:22.042 --> 24:23.710
I DON'T HAVE FRESH FOOD.

24:23.710 --> 24:26.463
<i>EVERYTHING WE COME IN,</i>
<i>EXCEPT FOR OUR PRODUCE--</i>

24:26.463 --> 24:28.465
<i>OKAY, BUT, I MEAN,</i>
<i>YOU DON'T HAVE FRESH FOOD.</i>

<i>ALL OF OUR--</i>

24:31.760 --> 24:33.136
WE DO.

24:33.136 --> 24:34.304
COME ON, WHAT, DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO GIVE YOU

24:34.304 --> 24:36.098
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE
'CAUSE YOU MAKE YOUR OWN SAUCE?

24:36.098 --> 24:37.724
<i>RIGHT.</i>

24:42.854 --> 24:43.855
<i>LASAGNA.</i>

24:43.855 --> 24:46.316
STONE--COLD

24:46.316 --> 24:48.401
<i>THE WORST THING ABOUT YOU</i>
<i>DEFROSTING IT--</i>

24:48.401 --> 24:50.320
"A", YOU CAN'T OPERATE
A  MICROWAVE,

24:50.320 --> 24:52.572
<i>AND "B", THE BITS</i>
<i>THAT YOU WERE COOKING,</i>

24:52.572 --> 24:54.282
THEY WERE BLAND.

24:54.282 --> 24:55.367
NOW, THE VEAL--

24:55.367 --> 24:56.701
THE VEAL IS OLD.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

24:56.701 --> 24:57.953
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, OLD?

24:57.953 --> 24:58.949
I MEAN I DON'T ORDER VEAL
VERY OFTEN.

24:58.949 --> 24:59.913
I MEAN I DON'T ORDER VEAL
VERY OFTEN.

24:59.913 --> 25:01.206
IT WAS RAW. THAT WAS WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO SAY.

25:01.206 --> 25:03.250
OH.

25:03.250 --> 25:05.627
FRESH PACIFIC SALMON,

25:06.711 --> 25:08.505
FROZEN.

25:08.505 --> 25:10.590

LOOKED DREADFUL.

25:10.590 --> 25:11.883
<i>OVERCOOKED.</i>

25:11.883 --> 25:13.385
NO ONE COMPLAINS
ABOUT THAT SALMON.

25:13.385 --> 25:14.845
OH, COME ON.
<i>PEOPLE LIKE IT.</i>

25:14.845 --> 25:16.429
<i>SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT</i>

25:16.429 --> 25:18.181
CUSTOMERS NEED TO KNOW
IT'S FROZEN?

25:18.181 --> 25:19.850
<i>IF THEY KNEW IT WAS FROZEN,</i>
<i>DO YOU THINK THEY'D ORDER IT?</i>

25:19.850 --> 25:21.226
DOES IT SAY "FRESH"
ON THE MENU?

25:21.226 --> 25:22.519
YES.

25:22.519 --> 25:23.687
OH, OKAY, WELL, THEN--
<i>BIG, BOLD LETTERS.</i>

25:23.687 --> 25:24.813
OKAY, THEN THAT'S A MISTAKE.

25:24.813 --> 25:26.022
<i>YOU DON'T KNOW.</i>

25:28.817 --> 25:28.949
WHEN WAS IT CHANGED?

25:28.949 --> 25:30.152
WHEN WAS IT CHANGED?

25:30.152 --> 25:31.987
<i>HOW LONG AGO WAS IT FRESH?</i>

25:31.987 --> 25:33.655
ABOUT 2 1/2, 3 YEARS.

25:33.655 --> 25:36.241
2 1/2, 3 YEARS AGO,
SO A WHILE.

25:36.241 --> 25:38.869
<i>WHEN DID THE SALMON ARRIVE?</i>

25:38.869 --> 25:40.287
COULDN'T TELL YOU, HONESTLY.

25:40.287 --> 25:41.663
YOU COULDN'T TELL ME.
<i>I COULDN'T TELL YOU.</i>

25:41.663 --> 25:43.039
OH, MY GOD.

25:43.039 --> 25:45.167
I'VE SEEN THAT SALMON IN THERE
FOR A WHILE.

25:45.167 --> 25:46.710
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EITHER.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.295
I'M JUST SAYING.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EITHER.

25:48.295 --> 25:50.505
THAT'S OKAY.
OKAY.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.674
WHY DO YOU GO IN DENIAL
WHEN THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH,

25:52.674 --> 25:54.217
AND THEY'RE
IN THE ENGINE ROOM?

25:54.217 --> 25:55.635
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
THAT ORDERS THE FOOD.

25:55.635 --> 25:57.387
BUT WE'RE THE ONES THAT COOK
AND MAKE THE FOOD.

25:57.387 --> 25:58.949
I DON'T COOK IT,
BUT I ORDER IT.

25:58.949 --> 25:59.973
I DON'T COOK IT,
BUT I ORDER IT.

25:59.973 --> 26:01.516
SO WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU ORDERED SALMON?

26:01.516 --> 26:04.269
PROBABLY TWO WEEKS AGO.

26:04.269 --> 26:05.854
WHY ARE YOU SHAKING
YOUR HEAD?

26:05.854 --> 26:07.272
<i>'CAUSE IT'S BEEN IN THERE</i>

<i>DO YOU THINK</i>
<i>CUSTOMERS LOCALLY,</i>

26:11.443 --> 26:13.028
DO YOU THINK THEY
SHOULD LEAVE THEIR HOMES,

COME INTO YOUR RESTAURANT

26:14.404 --> 26:16.990
<i>AND PAY FOR FROZEN FOOD</i>

26:16.990 --> 26:18.366

IS GOOD?

26:32.339 --> 26:33.924
I THINK IT'S GOOD.
<i>NO--</i>

27:17.008 --> 27:18.093
<i>INTO THIS PLACE.</i>
OKAY, FINE.

27:18.093 --> 27:20.136
NO, BUT--
COME ON, THEN, MAN UP.

27:20.136 --> 27:21.554
<i>I WILL SAY THIS.</i>

27:21.554 --> 27:24.140
WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CUSTOMER--
ANDY WILL B--

27:24.140 --> 27:25.433
<i>I HAVE VERY--</i>
<i>HAD VERY FEW CUSTOMERS</i>

27:25.433 --> 27:27.310
EVER ACTUALLY COMPLAIN
TO MY FACE.

27:27.310 --> 27:28.311
<i>OKAY, JANELLE,</i>

27:28.311 --> 27:28.949
I'M NOT INTERESTED

27:28.949 --> 27:29.854
I'M NOT INTERESTED

27:29.854 --> 27:32.941
ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS THAT BLOW
SMOKE UP YOUR ASS CURRENTLY.

27:32.941 --> 27:34.275
<i>I'M INTERESTED</i>
<i>IN THE CUSTOMERS</i>

27:34.275 --> 27:35.694
<i>THAT AREN'T COMING</i>
<i>ANY LONGER.</i>

27:35.694 --> 27:36.903
<i>AND TRUTHFULLY,</i>

27:36.903 --> 27:40.323
MOST CUSTOMERS
DON'T LIKE TO COMPLAIN

27:40.323 --> 27:41.199
TO YOUR FACE.

27:41.199 --> 27:42.784
THEY JUST DON'T COME BACK.

27:42.784 --> 27:47.330
<i>THEY VOTE WITH THEIR FEET.</i>

27:47.330 --> 27:48.623
<i>I DON'T THINK</i>
<i>YOU'VE GOT ANY IDEA</i>

27:48.623 --> 27:50.333
HOW THIS BUSINESS
IS FUNCTIONING.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.961
I DO UNDERSTAND HOW
THE BUSINESS IS FUNCTIONING.

27:52.961 --> 27:54.295
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S ON YOUR MENU.

27:54.295 --> 27:55.255
<i>YOU DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>HOW IT'S WRITTEN.</i>

27:55.255 --> 27:56.715
YOUR CHEFS DISAGREE WITH YOU.

27:56.715 --> 27:57.799
<i>I MEAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN</i>

27:57.799 --> 27:58.949
SO MANY PEOPLE
SO FAR APART.

27:58.949 --> 27:59.134
SO MANY PEOPLE
SO FAR APART.

27:59.134 --> 28:01.469
<i>AND THE PROOF'S</i>
<i>IN THE TASTING.</i>

28:01.469 --> 28:04.848
'CAUSE IT FELT
JUST ALL OVER THE SHOP.

28:04.848 --> 28:06.016
YOU ARE WAY OUT OF YOUR DEPTH.

28:06.016 --> 28:10.270
<i>THE FOOD--</i>
<i>BLAND, BORING, DATED.</i>

28:10.270 --> 28:12.313
<i>AND WHEN A HEAD COOK</i>
<i>CAN'T EVEN OPERATE</i>

28:12.313 --> 28:15.525
A  MICROWAVE, THAT SCARES
THE  OUT OF ME.

28:15.525 --> 28:16.818
BUT THE OWNER SAID
YOUR FOOD'S GOOD.

28:16.818 --> 28:18.528
<i>SO...</i>

28:18.528 --> 28:22.198
CONTINUE KISSING THEIR ASS.

28:22.198 --> 28:23.199
WOW.

28:23.199 --> 28:25.243
"MY FOOD'S GOOD."

28:25.243 --> 28:27.537
"MY FOOD'S GOOD."
YEAH.

28:27.537 --> 28:28.949
<i>"MY FOOD'S GOOD."</i>

28:28.949 --> 28:31.332
<i>"MY FOOD'S GOOD."</i>

28:31.332 --> 28:32.709
WELL, THAT WASN'T PLEASANT.

28:40.258 --> 28:42.135
TREVOR'S BEING A LITTLE.

28:44.971 --> 28:47.182
DON'T CRY.

28:47.182 --> 28:48.767
IT HURTS MY FEELINGS.
<i>I KNOW.</i>

28:48.767 --> 28:51.269
IF YOU CRY, I'LL CRY.

28:51.269 --> 28:53.897
OH, GOD.

28:53.897 --> 28:56.316
THAT WAS BRUTAL.

28:57.192 --> 28:58.949
<i>THAT WAS A LITTLE</i>
<i>TOO ROUGH.</i>

28:58.949 --> 28:59.527
<i>THAT WAS A LITTLE</i>
<i>TOO ROUGH.</i>

29:04.157 --> 29:06.076
LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

29:06.076 --> 29:07.285
OKAY.

29:13.500 --> 29:17.087
THAT WAS VERY UNPLEASANT.

29:17.087 --> 29:19.172
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I'VE EVER FELT

29:19.172 --> 29:23.134
LIKE THIS BEFORE...
EVER IN MY LIFE.

29:23.134 --> 29:25.136
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

29:32.810 --> 29:34.436
AFTER A FRUSTRATING CONVERSATION

29:34.436 --> 29:36.480
WITH THE DEFIANT OWNER
ABOUT THE MANY PROBLEMS

29:36.480 --> 29:37.481
WITH THE FOOD...

29:37.481 --> 29:39.191
HI, THERE.
HOW Y'ALL DOING?

29:39.191 --> 29:40.943
CHEF RAMSAY RETURNS TO SEE

29:40.943 --> 29:42.778
HOW THE DISHES ARE PREPARED
BY THIS BAND

29:42.778 --> 29:45.906
OF YOUNG COOKS
AT MANGIA MANGIA.

29:45.906 --> 29:47.407
SO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE LINE.
HOW DOES THAT--

29:47.407 --> 29:49.368
HOW DOES THIS ROLL?

29:49.368 --> 29:51.203
WELL, WE GOT OUR SAUTE.
SAUTE?

29:51.203 --> 29:52.788
YEP. ALL OF OUR RAWS--

29:52.788 --> 29:55.082
<i>OUR VEGGIES, OUR PRODUCE,</i>
<i>YADA YADA.</i>

29:55.082 --> 29:56.416
WHAT'S IN HERE?

29:56.416 --> 29:57.975
<i>THE MEATBALLS AND SAUSAGE</i>
<i>AND MARINARA.</i>

29:57.975 --> 29:58.001
<i>THE MEATBALLS AND SAUSAGE</i>
<i>AND MARINARA.</i>

29:58.001 --> 29:59.628
IT'S LIKE AN OIL SLICK
IN THERE.

29:59.628 --> 30:00.629
WOW.

30:00.629 --> 30:03.257
<i>THAT'S TERRIBLE.</i>

30:03.257 --> 30:04.633
IS THAT NORMALLY LIKE THAT?

30:04.633 --> 30:06.134
<i>SHE SAID THE SPINACH WAS TART,</i>

30:06.134 --> 30:07.135
<i>DIDN'T TASTE FRESH.</i>

30:07.135 --> 30:08.554
I THINK IT LOOKS
JUST FINE.

30:08.554 --> 30:10.430
<i>WE HAVEN'T MET, HAVE WE?</i>
YES, SIR.

30:10.430 --> 30:11.765
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN HERE, BUD?

30:11.765 --> 30:13.058
COUPLE MONTHS.
COUPLE OF MONTHS?

30:13.058 --> 30:14.476
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PLACE,
IN YOUR MIND?

30:14.476 --> 30:15.978
WE HAVE A LEADERSHIP PROBLEM.

30:15.978 --> 30:17.396
THESE GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN
TRAINED PROPERLY.

30:17.396 --> 30:18.397
<i>YEAH, YOU'RE NOT WRONG.</i>

30:18.397 --> 30:19.439
HONESTLY, I DON'T FEEL

30:19.439 --> 30:21.483
THAT JULIE HAS
THE LEADERSHIP QUALITIES.

30:21.483 --> 30:24.111
WE HAVE A VERY YOUNG STAFF,
AN INEXPERIENCED STAFF,

30:24.111 --> 30:26.238
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE'S THE BIGGEST REASON

30:26.238 --> 30:27.975
THAT THEY'RE NOT
WHERE THEY NEED TO BE.

30:27.975 --> 30:28.365
THAT THEY'RE NOT
WHERE THEY NEED TO BE.

30:28.365 --> 30:29.658
OH, NO, WHAT'S WRONG,
JANELLE?

30:29.658 --> 30:31.076
SAID THEY'RE TOO SALTY,
SO THEY'RE ORDERING

30:31.076 --> 30:32.160
SOMETHING ELSE,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.203
TOO SALTY.

30:33.203 --> 30:34.496
<i>ARE YOU NOT INTERESTED</i>

30:34.496 --> 30:35.330
<i>IN TASTING THIS</i>
<i>WHEN IT COMES BACK,</i>

30:35.330 --> 30:36.832
OR YOU JUST,  IT,
IT COMES BACK?

30:36.832 --> 30:38.375
I JUST SAY  IT.
I DON'T TASTE IT.

30:38.375 --> 30:39.835
YOU JUST SAY  IT
AND DON'T TASTE IT?

30:39.835 --> 30:42.629
YES, CHEF.
WOW.

30:42.629 --> 30:44.464
IT'S YELLOW.
IT'S LIMP.

30:44.464 --> 30:46.466
JULIE, THAT'S THE SPINACH
FROM BEHIND THE LINE.

30:46.466 --> 30:47.801
<i>IT CAN'T LOOK LIKE THIS.</i>

30:47.801 --> 30:49.386
IT'S BEHIND THE LINE.
THEY'RE COOKING WITH IT.

30:49.386 --> 30:50.679
OKAY, WHY DOES THE SPINACH
LOOK LIKE THIS?

30:50.679 --> 30:51.847
<i>THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN</i>

30:51.847 --> 30:52.848
GETTING IN.

30:52.848 --> 30:54.057
NO  WAY.

30:54.057 --> 30:55.309
<i>AND WE'VE HAD TO WASH IT</i>

30:55.309 --> 30:56.518
BECAUSE SOMEONE LAST NIGHT HAD
A PIECE OF SAND IN IT.

30:56.518 --> 30:57.519
<i>SERIOUSLY?</i>

30:57.519 --> 30:57.975
WHAT THE  IS THIS?

30:57.975 --> 30:58.979
WHAT THE  IS THIS?

30:58.979 --> 31:00.147
SPINACH THAT YOU ORDERED.

31:00.147 --> 31:01.899
THIS IS NOT--
OUR SPINACH HAS NEVER,

31:01.899 --> 31:03.734
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER LOOKED LIKE THIS.

31:03.734 --> 31:05.360
HE'S TRYING TO IMPRESS
CHEF RAMSAY.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.987
BUT THAT IS NOT TREVOR.

31:06.987 --> 31:08.780
TREVOR IS A SPOILED
LITTLE BASTARD

31:08.780 --> 31:11.450
THAT REFUSES
TO DO HIS JOB.

31:11.450 --> 31:12.868
I HAVE NEVER SEEN OUR SPINACH
LOOK LIKE THIS

31:12.868 --> 31:13.869
IN FOUR YEARS.

31:13.869 --> 31:15.162
THEY'VE COOKED WITH IT.

31:15.162 --> 31:16.747
THEY'VE SENT IT.
YOU'VE CHARGED FOR IT.

31:16.747 --> 31:18.415
<i>YOU NEED TO SEE IT.</i>
I SEE IT.

31:18.415 --> 31:19.666
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA LET THEM
COOK WITH IT?

31:19.666 --> 31:20.834
NO, I'M GONNA HAVE--

31:20.834 --> 31:21.919
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

31:21.919 --> 31:23.128
UH-HUH.

31:23.128 --> 31:24.838
THROW THAT  OUT.

31:24.838 --> 31:26.298
IT'S HARD NOT TO LAUGH.

31:26.298 --> 31:27.975
I KNOW..

31:27.975 --> 31:28.550
I KNOW..

31:30.093 --> 31:31.428
LOOK AT THIS IN HERE.

31:31.428 --> 31:34.431
IN THE WALK-IN HE GOES.

31:34.431 --> 31:35.891
THERE'S MOLD ON THE FLOOR.

31:35.891 --> 31:37.184
<i>LOOK AT THAT.</i>

31:37.184 --> 31:39.478
<i>THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE HORROR.</i>

31:39.478 --> 31:41.229
IT'S JUST USED
LIKE A TRASH CAN.

31:41.229 --> 31:43.190
THEY'RE EVEN BUYING
PEELED ONIONS.

31:43.190 --> 31:45.025
<i>HOW MUCH PASTA</i>
<i>ARE THEY COOKING?</i>

31:45.025 --> 31:47.194
<i>MAN, IS HE EXPECTING</i>
<i>A PASTA RUSH?</i>

31:47.194 --> 31:48.654
AND MORE PASTA.

31:48.654 --> 31:50.113
HE'S OBSESSED WITH SPAGHETTI.

31:50.113 --> 31:51.990
CONTAINERS OF PASTA COOKED.

31:51.990 --> 31:53.283
ALL THIS WORK FOR WHAT?

31:53.283 --> 31:55.369
WHAT IS HE DOING?

31:55.369 --> 31:56.536
OKAY.

31:56.536 --> 31:57.975
JULIE, YOU GOT TWO SECONDS?
<i>SURE.</i>

31:57.975 --> 31:58.538
JULIE, YOU GOT TWO SECONDS?
<i>SURE.</i>

31:58.538 --> 31:59.665
<i>HOW OFTEN DOES</i>
<i>THE RESTAURANT COOK PASTA?</i>

31:59.665 --> 32:00.791
ABOUT EVERY DAY,
EVERY OTHER DAY.

32:00.791 --> 32:02.125
SO, LIKE, TWICE A DAY?

32:02.125 --> 32:03.335
FRESH FOR LUNCH,
FRESH FOR DINNER?
NO.

32:03.335 --> 32:05.128
ONCE A DAY,
THEY'LL COOK IT IN THE--

32:05.128 --> 32:06.171
LIKE, MIDDAY.

32:06.171 --> 32:07.255
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.

32:07.255 --> 32:08.340
UH-HUH, OKAY.

32:08.340 --> 32:09.508
<i>DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA</i>

32:09.508 --> 32:10.801
<i>WHAT'S GOING ON</i>
<i>BEHIND HERE?</i>

32:10.801 --> 32:12.511
<i>THIS WILL BE USED TODAY.</i>

32:12.511 --> 32:14.930
CAN YOU STOP DREAMING?

32:14.930 --> 32:18.392
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY PORTIONS ARE IN HERE?

32:18.392 --> 32:20.435
NO, I DON'T.
YOU'VE GOT--
YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA

32:20.435 --> 32:21.853
<i>HOW MANY PORTIONS</i>

32:21.853 --> 32:23.063
OF CAPPELLINI PASTA
ARE IN THERE?

32:23.063 --> 32:24.189
NO, I DON'T.

32:24.189 --> 32:25.732
OKAY, HOW MANY
DO YOU THINK, THEN?

32:25.732 --> 32:26.733
<i>ROUGHLY?</i>

32:26.733 --> 32:27.776
20?
<i>20.</i>

32:27.776 --> 32:27.975
NOW, THAT IS A LOT
OF CAPPELLINI.

32:27.975 --> 32:29.695
NOW, THAT IS A LOT
OF CAPPELLINI.

32:29.695 --> 32:31.488
THAT'S JUST ONE CONTAINER.

32:31.488 --> 32:33.907
<i>IT'S PASTA MANIA.</i>

32:33.907 --> 32:36.326
1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8,

32:36.326 --> 32:39.204
9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16.

32:39.204 --> 32:42.666
<i>ENOUGH PASTA FOR CLOSE</i>
<i>TO 400 PORTIONS</i>

32:42.666 --> 32:44.835
ON THIS TABLE HERE.

32:44.835 --> 32:46.586
AND WE'VE GOT HOW MANY
CUSTOMERS TONIGHT?

32:46.586 --> 32:48.005
53.
47.

32:48.005 --> 32:49.423
47.

32:49.423 --> 32:51.299
I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE'S
THIS MUCH PASTA COOKED.

32:51.299 --> 32:53.885
I'M ONLY ASKING YOU
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EITHER!

32:53.885 --> 32:55.137
I'M LOOKING AT IT THINKING,

32:55.137 --> 32:57.975
<i>WHAT FRUITCAKE'S</i>
<i>OPERATING THIS?</i>

32:57.975 --> 32:58.306
<i>WHAT FRUITCAKE'S</i>
<i>OPERATING THIS?</i>

32:58.306 --> 32:59.474
<i>WE DON'T HAVE</i>
<i>THIS MUCH PASTA.</i>

32:59.474 --> 33:00.517
<i>IT DIDN'T REPRODUCE ITSELF.</i>

33:00.517 --> 33:01.435
<i>LET'S GET THAT RIGHT.</i>

33:01.435 --> 33:02.769
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE
WITH YOU.

33:02.769 --> 33:04.479
THERE'S USUALLY THREE.

33:04.479 --> 33:05.856
ONE, TWO, THREE.

33:05.856 --> 33:07.065
NOT ALL THIS OTHER.

33:07.065 --> 33:08.650
THESE TWO, I DON'T KNOW
WHY THESE ARE HERE.

33:08.650 --> 33:10.694
YOU JUST TOLD ME THIS IS ALL
GONNA BE USED IN A DAY.

33:10.694 --> 33:12.237
NO, I'M SAY--
IF YOU--IF IT--

33:12.237 --> 33:13.447
OKAY, THEY USUALLY--
<i>'CAUSE HERE'S THE THING.</i>

33:13.447 --> 33:15.073
I'M GONNA GET CHANGED.
OKAY.

33:15.073 --> 33:16.867
AND I'M GONNA DRIVE STRAIGHT
BACK TO THE  AIRPORT,

33:16.867 --> 33:18.660
BECAUSE YOU ARE
JUST  ME.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.037
OKAY, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

33:20.037 --> 33:21.204
<i>PLEASE.</i>

33:21.204 --> 33:22.998
HOW CAN THEY COOK THE PASTA

33:22.998 --> 33:24.207
FOR EVERY ORDER THAT FAST?

33:24.207 --> 33:25.500
DOESN'T IT TAKE--
IT WOULD--

33:25.500 --> 33:26.460
THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE WAITING.

33:26.460 --> 33:27.975
"THESE PEOPLE
WOULD BE WAITING."

33:27.975 --> 33:28.336
"THESE PEOPLE
WOULD BE WAITING."

33:28.336 --> 33:29.463
<i>SO THIS IS CAPPELLINI.</i>

33:29.463 --> 33:31.506
I KNOW IT IS.
WHICH COOKS IN HOW LONG?

33:31.506 --> 33:33.300
ABOUT THREE MINUTES.
90 SECONDS.

33:33.300 --> 33:34.676
I'M TELLING YOU...
<i>I HAVE NEVER SEEN--</i>

33:34.676 --> 33:36.470
I'M NOT A CHEF.

33:36.470 --> 33:37.763
<i>I HAVE NEVER SEEN</i>

33:37.763 --> 33:39.306
ANYTHING AS BAD AS THIS.

33:39.306 --> 33:40.766
<i>OKAY.</i>
BUT WHAT I'M JUST TRYING

33:40.766 --> 33:42.601
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU
IS COMMON SENSE.

33:42.601 --> 33:45.312
<i>MAYBE YOU ARE</i>
<i>A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT.</i>

33:54.445 --> 33:56.989
IT'S DINNER SERVICE
AT MANGIA MANGIA.

33:56.989 --> 33:58.491
<i>I HAVE NEVER SEEN</i>

33:58.491 --> 34:00.409
ANYTHING AS BAD AS THIS.

34:00.409 --> 34:01.827
AND CHEF RAMSAY HAS DISCOVERED

34:01.827 --> 34:05.206
OVER 400 PORTIONS
OF PRE-COOKED PASTA,

34:05.206 --> 34:08.751
AND JULIE REFUSES TO TAKE
ANY RESPONSIBILITY.

34:08.751 --> 34:11.712
MAYBE YOU ARE
A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT.

34:11.712 --> 34:13.422
<i>LOOK AT ALL THIS PASTA!</i>

34:13.422 --> 34:16.425
I  AGREE WITH YOU.

34:16.425 --> 34:18.219
<i>OH, NO, NO MORE PASTA.</i>

34:18.219 --> 34:19.512
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?
THAT'S GLUTEN-FREE.

34:19.512 --> 34:20.987
THIS IS GLUTEN-FREE.
GLUTEN-FREE.

34:20.987 --> 34:21.514
THIS IS GLUTEN-FREE.
GLUTEN-FREE.

34:21.514 --> 34:23.098
AND THERE'S THE ANGEL HAIR
THAT IS FROM--

34:23.098 --> 34:24.183
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GO WAIT
ON MY TABLE.

34:24.183 --> 34:25.351
YOU GUYS NEED TO PICK UP
TABLE 19.

34:25.351 --> 34:26.519
YOU CONTINUE
RUNNING YOUR BUSINESS.

34:26.519 --> 34:27.853
I DON'T WANT TO STOP YOU.

34:27.853 --> 34:29.313
<i>ANY MORE PASTA</i>
<i>IN THE HOUSE?</i>

34:29.313 --> 34:30.439
NOT THAT I KNOW OF, CHEF.

34:30.439 --> 34:31.357
ME.

34:31.357 --> 34:32.650
THEY WAY OVERCOOKED PASTA

34:32.650 --> 34:34.235
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

34:34.235 --> 34:35.361
<i>THEY'RE TRYING TO BURY ME.</i>

34:35.361 --> 34:36.487
YEAH, I THINK THEY ARE TOO.

34:36.487 --> 34:38.113
HOW'S THAT FISH LOOKING?

34:38.113 --> 34:40.658
NOT THE PRETTIEST,
BUT I'M GETTING IT OUT.

34:40.658 --> 34:43.035
I DON'T KNOW WHY JULIE DOESN'T
WANT TO FIRE TREVOR.

34:43.035 --> 34:44.620
HE HALF-ASSES STUFF.

34:44.620 --> 34:47.623
HE'S LAZY.

34:47.623 --> 34:49.375
SO WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S OUR MEAT LASAGNA.

34:49.375 --> 34:50.987
WE NUKE IT FOR FOUR MINUTES,
PUT CHEESE ON,

34:50.987 --> 34:51.418
WE NUKE IT FOR FOUR MINUTES,
PUT CHEESE ON,

34:51.418 --> 34:52.586
AND NUKE IT FOR TWO MINUTES.

34:52.586 --> 34:54.713
<i>SO IT'S A DOUBLE NUKE.</i>

34:54.713 --> 34:56.215
WOW.

34:56.215 --> 34:57.716
THAT LOOKS LIKE
A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.

34:57.716 --> 34:59.134
NOW YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT
BACK IN THERE WITH CHEESE?

34:59.134 --> 35:00.135
<i>CHEESE ON IT.</i>

35:00.135 --> 35:02.096
<i>MY GOD.</i>

35:02.096 --> 35:03.347
OH,  ME.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

35:03.347 --> 35:05.099
WHERE'S THAT GOING NOW?
EGGPLANT--

35:05.099 --> 35:06.767
<i>INTO THE MICROWAVE.</i>

35:06.767 --> 35:07.977
<i>AND THEN WHAT?</i>

35:07.977 --> 35:09.228
<i>BACK ON THE PLATE.</i>
THEN BACK ON THE PLATE.

35:09.228 --> 35:10.396
<i>AND MARINARA,</i>
<i>AND SEND IT OUT.</i>

35:10.396 --> 35:12.857
HELL.

35:12.857 --> 35:14.316
CAN I USE ANY
OF THE MICROWAVES?

35:14.316 --> 35:15.609
PSH, I DON'T KNOW.

35:15.609 --> 35:17.444
MICROWAVES ARE FULL
RIGHT NOW.

35:17.444 --> 35:18.696
OH, FOR  SAKE.

35:18.696 --> 35:19.780
<i>ONCE AGAIN,</i>

35:19.780 --> 35:20.865
<i>WE'RE WORKING THAT MICROWAVE.</i>

35:20.865 --> 35:20.987
ONE, TWO OVENS.

35:20.987 --> 35:23.158
ONE, TWO OVENS.

35:23.158 --> 35:24.869
<i>ONE, TWO, THREE</i>
<i>MICROWAVES.</i>

35:24.869 --> 35:26.328
<i>MORE MICROWAVES THAN OVENS.</i>

35:26.328 --> 35:27.413
I HAVE TO AGREE.

35:27.413 --> 35:28.581
OH, , HOLD ON.
GET THAT.

35:28.581 --> 35:29.790
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S HOT.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.250
AND WHAT IS THIS?

35:31.250 --> 35:32.543
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
VEGGIE LASAGNAS,

35:32.543 --> 35:34.670
BUT THE MICROWAVE, LIKE,
GOOS IT OUT.

35:34.670 --> 35:36.589
THE FINAL RESULT
IS A HARD PIECE.

35:36.589 --> 35:38.090
I CAN'T EVEN CUT IT.

35:38.090 --> 35:39.425
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
MICROWAVED TOO LONG.

35:39.425 --> 35:40.384
YEP.

35:40.384 --> 35:43.345
DOCTOR, DO YOU NEED A SCALPEL?

35:43.345 --> 35:44.346
I THINK THE PATIENT IS DEAD.

35:44.346 --> 35:46.015
JULIE?
<i>YES?</i>

35:46.015 --> 35:48.309
TIME OF DEATH, 7:44.

35:48.309 --> 35:49.351
<i>JUST TOUCH THAT</i>
<i>FOR TWO SECONDS.</i>

35:49.351 --> 35:50.987
IT WON'T HURT.
MM-HMM.

35:50.987 --> 35:51.061
IT WON'T HURT.
MM-HMM.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.396
<i>BUT WHEN YOU JUST SAY</i>
<i>"OKAY," IT'S LIKE--</i>

35:52.396 --> 35:53.772
I'M NOT SAYING OKAY.
I'M SAYING,

35:53.772 --> 35:55.274
SOMETHING'S  UP.

35:55.274 --> 35:56.358
SOMETHING'S  UP.

35:56.358 --> 35:57.568
WHY DOES IT LOOK
LIKE THAT, TREVOR?

35:57.568 --> 35:59.320
BECAUSE IT'S MICROWAVED.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.821
WE HAVE BEEN COOKING THESE
FOR FOUR YEARS THIS WAY.

36:00.821 --> 36:02.448
ALL OF THE SUDDEN,
THEY'RE  UP?

36:02.448 --> 36:04.241
IT'S BEEN  UP
FOR A WHILE.

36:04.241 --> 36:05.910
<i>NO, THEY HAVEN'T.</i>

36:05.910 --> 36:07.870
DID YOU USE THE MICROWAVE
THAT I SAID DON'T  USE?

36:07.870 --> 36:08.913
YEAH.

36:08.913 --> 36:10.289
THEN WHY'D YOU USE IT?

36:10.289 --> 36:11.290
'CAUSE ALL THE MICROWAVES
DO THE SAME THING.

36:11.290 --> 36:13.167
WHY'D YOU  USE
THE ONE I SAID--

36:13.167 --> 36:14.877
'CAUSE ALL THE MICROWAVES
DO THE SAME THING.

36:14.877 --> 36:16.837
I'M SERIOUS, KEVIN.
IF YOU USE IT AGAIN,

36:16.837 --> 36:18.255
ME AND YOU ARE GONNA HAVE
A  PROBLEM.

36:18.255 --> 36:19.381
ALL RIGHT.

36:19.381 --> 36:20.987
HA. DEAL.

36:20.987 --> 36:21.008
HA. DEAL.

36:21.008 --> 36:23.093
KEVIN HAS NEVER TALKED
TO ME THAT WAY,

36:23.093 --> 36:26.263
AND I CAN SEE THAT TREVOR
IS RUBBING OFF ON THAT GUY.

36:26.263 --> 36:27.640
<i>CHRIS, HURRY UP.</i>

36:27.640 --> 36:28.641
I NEED TO PUT SOMETHING IN.

36:28.641 --> 36:29.767
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO?

36:29.767 --> 36:30.851
I CAN'T GO ANY FASTER

36:30.851 --> 36:32.186
THAN THE COMPUTER'S GOING.

36:32.186 --> 36:33.812
NO, I--
YOU'RE FIDDLY- AROUND.

36:33.812 --> 36:35.272
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

36:35.272 --> 36:36.565
YOU WANT TO PLATE UP
THESE RAVIOLIS

36:36.565 --> 36:37.858
<i>AND GET 'EM OUT?</i>

36:37.858 --> 36:39.401
WASN'T THERE SUPPOSED
TO BE NO SAUCE?

36:39.401 --> 36:40.569
KISS MY ASS.

36:40.569 --> 36:41.987
WHILE JULIE AND TREVOR CONTINUE

36:41.987 --> 36:44.615
TO POINT THE FINGER
AT EACH OTHER...

36:44.615 --> 36:46.325
IT IS SALTY.
IT'S SO SALTY.

36:46.325 --> 36:48.410
CHEF RAMSAY OBSERVES

36:48.410 --> 36:49.912
THE MAJORITY OF TABLES
IN THE DINING ROOM

36:49.912 --> 36:50.987
ARE DISAPPOINTED
WITH THE FOOD.

36:50.987 --> 36:51.997
ARE DISAPPOINTED
WITH THE FOOD.

36:51.997 --> 36:53.374
THAT'S OVERCOOKED.
MEDIUM-WELL.

36:53.374 --> 36:55.084
SHOULD BE A THIN, PINK LINE,
GENTLEMEN.

36:55.084 --> 36:56.460
THIN, PINK LINE.

36:56.460 --> 36:59.004
OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S JUST--

36:59.004 --> 37:00.339
IT'S WAY OVER.

37:00.339 --> 37:01.340
IT'S WAY OVER.

37:01.340 --> 37:02.383
TASTES FROZEN.
RIGHT?

37:02.383 --> 37:03.676
<i>CAFETERIA?</i>
YEAH.

37:03.676 --> 37:05.219
SO VERY SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

37:05.219 --> 37:06.929
THEY ARE WORKING
ON ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU.

37:06.929 --> 37:08.180
<i>SHOULD BE OUT</i>
<i>IN JUST A SECOND.</i>

37:08.180 --> 37:09.473
WOW.

37:09.473 --> 37:11.016
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:11.016 --> 37:13.352
THEY WEREN'T HAPPY WITH
THE BREADING ON THE EGGPLANT.

37:13.352 --> 37:15.479
THEY SAID IT WAS TOO THICK
AND DIDN'T TASTE FRESH.

37:18.315 --> 37:19.358
TRUTHFULLY, NOW, WHEN WAS

37:19.358 --> 37:20.818
THE LAST TIME THAT WAS CHANGED,
YOUR BREADCRUMBS?

37:20.818 --> 37:20.987
YESTERDAY.

37:20.987 --> 37:22.403
YESTERDAY.

37:22.403 --> 37:23.404
SO YOU DON'T DO IT DAILY?

37:23.404 --> 37:24.405
NO.
<i>WOW.</i>

37:24.405 --> 37:25.739
<i>SHE COMPLAINS</i>
<i>ABOUT THE PRICE.</i>

37:25.739 --> 37:27.282
WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT THE PRICE?
JULIE.

37:27.282 --> 37:28.283
WHAT ELSE DO YOU PUT
IN THERE?

37:28.283 --> 37:29.952
CHICKEN AND EGGPLANT.

37:29.952 --> 37:31.453
YOU BREAD EGGPLANT...

37:31.453 --> 37:32.538
YES.
<i>AND CHICKEN</i>
<i>IN THE SAME CONTAINER?</i>

37:32.538 --> 37:33.539
YES.

37:33.539 --> 37:35.374
BUT LOOK AT THAT IN THERE.
<i>YEAH.</i>

37:35.374 --> 37:36.834
SO WHAT HAPPENS
FOR A VEGETARIAN?

37:36.834 --> 37:38.669
CROSS-CONTAMINATION.

37:38.669 --> 37:40.295
I HONESTLY NEVER EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
JULIE.

37:40.295 --> 37:42.214
YES?
<i>THEY CHANGE YOUR BREADCRUMBS</i>

37:42.214 --> 37:45.467
ONCE EVERY TWO DAYS.

37:45.467 --> 37:46.510
YOU LAUGH.

37:46.510 --> 37:47.886
I'M NOT LAUGHING AT YOU.

37:47.886 --> 37:50.987
I'M LAUGHING
'CAUSE THAT'S.

37:50.987 --> 37:51.724
I'M LAUGHING
'CAUSE THAT'S.

37:51.724 --> 37:53.267
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT I ASKED

37:53.267 --> 37:54.685
ABOUT THE BREADCRUMBS.
I UNDERSTAND.

37:54.685 --> 37:56.145
THE KITCHEN SAID THEY CHANGE
THEM EVERY TWO DAYS.

37:56.145 --> 37:57.271
THAT'S--I DON'T--OKAY.

37:57.271 --> 37:58.355
SO WHEN--WHEN--
OKAY.

37:58.355 --> 37:59.815
IN YOUR MIND, WHEN DO THEY
CHANGE THEM?
EVERY DAY.

37:59.815 --> 38:01.525
YOU'RE SAYING ONE THING.
THEY'RE SAYING THE OTHER.

38:01.525 --> 38:03.402
ALL I WANT IS THE TRUTH.
OKAY.

38:03.402 --> 38:05.279
THAT'S ALL I WANT!
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

38:05.279 --> 38:06.363
IS THIS FROM YESTERDAY?

38:06.363 --> 38:08.240
YES.
AND HOW OFTEN DO
YOU CHANGE IT?

38:08.240 --> 38:10.075
EVERY OTHER DAY.
EVERY OTHER DAY?

38:10.075 --> 38:12.286
YES.
BECAUSE JULIE MAKES SURE

38:12.286 --> 38:13.370
THAT YOU DON'T THROW
THEM AWAY.

38:13.370 --> 38:15.289
THAT'S.

38:15.289 --> 38:16.206
<i>OKAY, IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.</i>

38:16.206 --> 38:17.541
<i>DO YOU KNOW WHAT</i>
<i>THEY PUT IN THERE?</i>

38:17.541 --> 38:19.001
EGG.

38:19.001 --> 38:20.335
CHICKEN...
AND EGG.

38:20.335 --> 38:20.987
AND EGGPLANT.

38:20.987 --> 38:21.253
AND EGGPLANT.

38:21.253 --> 38:22.671
I KNOW WHAT THEY PUT
IN THERE.

38:22.671 --> 38:24.840
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
IS IN THERE,

38:24.840 --> 38:26.216
THERE'S BITS OF CHICKEN.

38:26.216 --> 38:27.301
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

38:27.301 --> 38:28.927
IF I WAS SAT HERE WITH MY WIFE
OR MY CHILDREN,

38:28.927 --> 38:30.471
AND THEY WANTED
A VEGETARIAN DISH,

38:30.471 --> 38:32.097
AND THEY GOT BITS
OF CHICKEN--

38:32.097 --> 38:33.640
OKAY, I'M NOT TAKING
ANY MORE  TABLES.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.476
WHAT?
I'M STRESSED OUT.

38:35.476 --> 38:36.477
I'M NOT TAKING
ANY MORE TABLES.

38:36.477 --> 38:37.853
YOU'RE CLOSING DOWN.

38:37.853 --> 38:41.106
I JUST CANNOT DO THIS
AND THAT.

38:49.531 --> 38:51.950
DURING DINNER SERVICE
AT MANGIA MANGIA...

38:51.950 --> 38:53.410
LOOK AT ALL THIS PASTA!

38:53.410 --> 38:54.369
CHEF RAMSAY HAS DISCOVERED

38:54.369 --> 38:57.247
OVER 400 PORTIONS
OF PRE-COOKED PASTA...

38:57.247 --> 38:59.332
THAT LOOKS LIKE
A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.

38:59.332 --> 39:00.792
AND ALMOST EVERY DISH

39:00.792 --> 39:02.961
BEING COOKED
IN THE MICROWAVE.

39:02.961 --> 39:05.964
OWNER JULIE STILL MAINTAINS
THAT HER FOOD IS GOOD

39:05.964 --> 39:07.882
AND THAT ALL
OF TONIGHT'S PROBLEMS

39:07.882 --> 39:09.384
ARE CAUSED BY THE COOKS.

39:09.384 --> 39:10.385
I'M NOT TAKING
ANY MORE  TABLES.

39:10.385 --> 39:11.594
YOU'RE CLOSING DOWN?

39:11.594 --> 39:15.056
I JUST CANNOT DO THIS
AND THAT.

39:15.056 --> 39:16.115
I'M WAITING ON TABLES.

39:16.115 --> 39:16.433
I'M WAITING ON TABLES.

39:16.433 --> 39:17.684
CAN YOU PASS THEM ON
TO THE WAITERS OR NOT?

39:17.684 --> 39:19.102
<i>YES, I CAN.</i>

39:19.102 --> 39:20.395
<i>IT'S JUST GOING FROM BAD</i>
<i>TO WORSE, AND YOU SEEM</i>

39:20.395 --> 39:21.855
<i>TO BE HAPPY WITH IT.</i>

39:21.855 --> 39:23.523
<i>MOM, YOU JUST GOT, LIKE,</i>
<i>FOUR TABLES.</i>

39:23.523 --> 39:24.482
<i>WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME</i>
<i>TO DO, JANELLE?</i>

39:24.482 --> 39:25.733
I DON'T KNOW.

39:25.733 --> 39:26.776
YOU NEED TO CHECK
ON YOUR TABLES, THOUGH.

39:26.776 --> 39:29.404
JULIE'S IN FOR IT.
MM-HMM.

39:33.450 --> 39:34.492
WHAT'S THE SOUP TODAY?

39:34.492 --> 39:35.493
ITALIAN WEDDING.

39:35.493 --> 39:36.494
WHO MADE THAT SOUP?

39:36.494 --> 39:37.662
<i>IT'S STORE-BOUGHT.</i>

39:37.662 --> 39:38.788
WEDDING SOUP FROZEN.
WHAT ELSE?

39:38.788 --> 39:40.331
<i>WHAT ELSE IS FROZEN?</i>
YEAH.

39:40.331 --> 39:41.374
EVERYTHING.
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

39:41.374 --> 39:43.960
YEAH, WE GOT A FULL
FREEZER FULL.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.128
THIS IS INSANE.

39:45.128 --> 39:46.115
<i>WE GOT OUR TUNA.</i>

39:46.115 --> 39:46.379
<i>WE GOT OUR TUNA.</i>

39:46.379 --> 39:47.589
<i>WE GOT OUR SALMON.</i>
<i>WE GOT OUR BEEF.</i>

39:47.589 --> 39:48.673
<i>WE'VE GOT OUR CHICKEN.</i>

39:48.673 --> 39:50.133
WE'VE GOT OUR SOUP.

39:50.133 --> 39:52.010
SO EVERYTHING'S FROZEN?
EVERYTHING.

39:52.010 --> 39:53.386
SO THERE'S NOTHING FRESH?

39:53.386 --> 39:55.263
NO, SIR.
NOTHING.

39:55.263 --> 39:57.390
DEEP BREATHS, DEEP BREATHS,
DEEP BREATHS.

39:57.390 --> 39:58.850
JULIE, HAVE YOU GOT TWO SECONDS?

39:58.850 --> 40:00.477
<i>TONIGHT'S THE WEDDING SOUP.</i>

40:00.477 --> 40:02.061
YES.
YEAH. POPULAR?

40:02.061 --> 40:03.062
YES.

40:03.062 --> 40:04.063
CHEF MADE IT?

40:04.063 --> 40:05.398
RIGHT. WELL, THEY--

40:05.398 --> 40:07.108
THEY DEFROSTED IT.
THEY DEFROSTED IT.

40:07.108 --> 40:08.818
THAT'S IT.
AND THE CUSTOMERS LOVE IT?

40:08.818 --> 40:10.069
YES. THEY DO LIKE IT.

40:10.069 --> 40:11.613
HOW MANY OF THEM KNOW
THAT IT'S FROZEN?

40:11.613 --> 40:13.448
I HAVE NOT HAD
THAT CONVERSATION.

40:13.448 --> 40:15.116
RIGHT.
BUT YOU TAKE THEIR MONEY.

40:15.116 --> 40:16.115
YES, I DO.

40:16.115 --> 40:16.659
YES, I DO.

40:16.659 --> 40:17.952
<i>SHAME ON YOU.</i>

40:17.952 --> 40:18.953
<i>WHAT DO YOU WANT ME</i>
<i>TO SAY?</i>

40:18.953 --> 40:20.455
YOU'VE GIVEN UP,
HAVEN'T YOU?

40:20.455 --> 40:22.499
NO, I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP
AT ALL.

40:22.499 --> 40:23.500
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO BETTER?

40:23.500 --> 40:24.959
NO.

40:24.959 --> 40:27.337
<i>YOU THINK IT'S FINE</i>
<i>TO MICROWAVE FROZEN FOOD?</i>

40:27.337 --> 40:28.922
I'M NOT MICROWAVING
FROZEN FOOD.

40:28.922 --> 40:30.298
WE'RE MICROWAVING--

40:30.298 --> 40:32.008
YOU THINK IT'S OKAY
TO SERVE FROZEN MEATBALLS?

40:32.008 --> 40:33.343
THEY'RE NOT FROZEN.

40:33.343 --> 40:34.844
THE MEATBALLS ARE FROZEN.

40:34.844 --> 40:36.137
THEY START OUT FROZEN.

40:36.137 --> 40:38.723
WOULDN'T THAT BE FROZEN?

40:38.723 --> 40:40.225
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

40:40.225 --> 40:41.351
<i>YOU'VE WORKED</i>
<i>AT THREE RESTAURANTS.</i>

40:41.351 --> 40:42.602
<i>YOU CAN'T BE THAT STUPID.</i>

40:42.602 --> 40:45.313
AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.

40:45.313 --> 40:46.115
I WOULD RESPECT YOU MORE
IF YOU WOULD JUST

40:46.115 --> 40:47.190
I WOULD RESPECT YOU MORE
IF YOU WOULD JUST

40:47.190 --> 40:48.483
BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.

40:48.483 --> 40:50.193
I'M BEING HONEST.
<i>YOU'RE DONE, HONEY.</i>

40:50.193 --> 40:51.569
YOU'RE NOT FIT
TO RUN THIS RESTAURANT.

40:51.569 --> 40:52.445
YES, I AM.

40:52.445 --> 40:53.696
WHAT QUALIFIES YOU?

40:53.696 --> 40:55.323
YEAH, I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO ASK THAT.

40:55.323 --> 40:57.158
YOU GO AWAY.
GET OUT.

40:57.158 --> 40:58.535
GO AWAY FROM MY FACE RIGHT NOW.
<i>WOW.</i>

40:58.535 --> 41:00.203
IT'S A FAKE.

41:00.203 --> 41:01.621
IT'S NOT FAKE.
<i>IF IT'S NOT FAKE,</i>

41:01.621 --> 41:03.248
THEN WHAT IS IT?

41:03.248 --> 41:04.207
IT'S A RESTAURANT.

41:04.207 --> 41:05.375
WHERE IS THERE A RESTAURANT?

41:05.375 --> 41:06.960
HERE.
<i>YOU DON'T MAKE ANYTHING.</i>

41:06.960 --> 41:08.545
YOU BUY EVERYTHING.

41:08.545 --> 41:11.256
<i>IF I GOT THOSE TABLES</i>
<i>OUT OF THAT DINING ROOM</i>

41:11.256 --> 41:12.423
<i>TO WATCH YOU REHEAT</i>

41:12.423 --> 41:14.509
<i>EGGPLANT, LASAGNA,</i>
<i>MEATBALLS,</i>

41:14.509 --> 41:16.115
<i>THEY WOULD  THEMSELVES.</i>

41:16.115 --> 41:16.469
<i>THEY WOULD  THEMSELVES.</i>

41:16.469 --> 41:17.971
I THOUGHT IT WAS NORMAL.

41:17.971 --> 41:20.640
WHEN YOU GO TO RESTAURANTS,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

41:20.640 --> 41:24.060
FRESH OR REHEATED FROZEN
VIA A MICROWAVE TWICE?

41:24.060 --> 41:25.728
<i>DO YOU EXPECT THAT</i>
<i>AS A CUSTOMER?</i>

41:25.728 --> 41:26.771
NO, I DON'T.

41:26.771 --> 41:28.439
SO WHY DO YOU DO IT?

41:28.439 --> 41:30.316
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT IT
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.

41:30.316 --> 41:31.484
<i>YOU DIDN'T.</i>

41:31.484 --> 41:32.819
'CAUSE YOU DON'T GIVE
A.

41:32.819 --> 41:33.820
I DO GIVE A.

41:33.820 --> 41:36.030
WHERE DO YOU GIVE A?

41:36.030 --> 41:38.157
<i>45 COVERS IN TONIGHT.</i>

41:38.157 --> 41:40.076
IF I ASK 45 CUSTOMERS,

41:40.076 --> 41:43.162
<i>"WHAT PERCENTAGE DO YOU THINK</i>
<i>OF YOUR FOOD WAS FRESH?"</i>

41:43.162 --> 41:44.872
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY WOULD SAY TO ME?

41:44.872 --> 41:45.957
I--

41:45.957 --> 41:46.115
NO, YOU TELL ME.

41:46.115 --> 41:47.166
NO, YOU TELL ME.

41:47.166 --> 41:49.335
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY WOULD SAY?

41:49.335 --> 41:50.795
DO YOU THINK THEY THINK
IT'S NORMAL?

41:55.008 --> 41:56.509
EXCUSE ME,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

41:56.509 --> 41:57.719
<i>OH, JULIE--JULIE.</i>
WHAT?

41:57.719 --> 41:59.095
ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY?
NO, I THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE.

41:59.095 --> 42:00.555
<i>CAN WE ASK THE CUSTOMERS</i>
<i>A QUESTION?</i>

42:00.555 --> 42:02.557
<i>I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE.</i>
OH, NO, NO.
I'M NOT DONE YET.

42:02.557 --> 42:03.933
<i>SHORTLY, I'LL BE DONE.</i>

42:03.933 --> 42:05.977
FIRST OF ALL, I'M SORRY
TO DISTURB YOUR DINNER.

42:05.977 --> 42:07.478
<i>JUST OUT OF INTEREST,</i>

42:07.478 --> 42:09.105
<i>WHEN YOU DECIDED TO COME HERE</i>
<i>THIS EVENING,</i>

42:09.105 --> 42:10.189
<i>YOU LOOK AT THE MENU.</i>

42:10.189 --> 42:11.399
WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF THAT MENU

42:11.399 --> 42:12.900
WOULD YOU EXPECT TO BE FRESH?

42:12.900 --> 42:14.527
<i>LET'S START</i>
<i>FROM TABLE TO TABLE.</i>

42:14.527 --> 42:15.903
LADIES?

42:15.903 --> 42:16.115
90 TO 100.

42:16.115 --> 42:18.239
90 TO 100.

42:18.239 --> 42:19.907
<i>90 TO 100. MADAM?</i>

42:19.907 --> 42:21.993
90 TO 100.

42:21.993 --> 42:23.411
<i>SIR?</i>

42:23.411 --> 42:24.412
100 ALL THE WAY.

42:24.412 --> 42:26.164
WELL, I AM DEEPLY SORRY.

42:26.164 --> 42:27.540
<i>BUT LET ME</i>
<i>TELL YOU SOMETHING.</i>

42:27.540 --> 42:31.711
IT'S NOT EVEN 5% FRESH.

42:31.711 --> 42:33.338
<i>IT WAS OBVIOUS.</i>

42:33.338 --> 42:35.340
<i>AND 95% OF EVERYTHING</i>
<i>YOU'VE EATEN THIS EVENING</i>

42:35.340 --> 42:36.466
<i>IS FROZEN.</i>

42:36.466 --> 42:37.759
AND YOU CAN COOK BETTER
AT HOME, YES?

42:37.759 --> 42:38.885
YES.
<i>YES.</i>

42:38.885 --> 42:42.430
SO WHY DO YOU THINK
IT'S FINE NOW?

42:42.430 --> 42:43.765
I'M LEAVING.
<i>YOU RUNNING AWAY?</i>

42:43.765 --> 42:45.224
<i>I'M NOT TAKING ANY MORE.</i>

42:45.224 --> 42:46.115
<i>JULIE.</i>

42:46.115 --> 42:46.601
<i>JULIE.</i>

42:46.601 --> 42:47.769
I'M WALKING OUT.

42:47.769 --> 42:49.145
YOU'RE WALKING OUT?

42:49.145 --> 42:50.355
<i>WOW.</i>

42:50.355 --> 42:51.564
<i>JUST NOT IN THE MOOD FOR IT.</i>

42:51.564 --> 42:54.150
I'M NOT GONNA BE SCREAMED AT
LIKE THAT.

42:54.150 --> 42:55.151
I CAN'T DO IT.

42:55.151 --> 42:56.152
<i>JULIE--</i>

42:56.152 --> 42:57.445
<i>I CANNOT DO THAT.</i>

43:02.025 --> 43:03.402
I'M WALKING OUT.
