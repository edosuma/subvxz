00:21.200 --> 00:25.640
Mr Shakespeare, sir, now that you
are made gentleman, sir,

00:25.640 --> 00:29.280
you are become master
of the Stratford watch, sir.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.920
As sergeant of the watch
and convener of the local militia,

00:32.920 --> 00:35.360
I, Sergeant Dogberry, sir,

00:35.360 --> 00:39.640
have the honour of presenting you,
sir, with, sir, your sword, sir.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.320
Oh!

00:41.320 --> 00:46.000
I've got a sword, Mary!
My very own sword!

00:46.000 --> 00:51.400
For truth, for justice and for
shoving fair up every bastable

00:51.400 --> 00:54.720
who's ever snooted his cock at us!

00:54.720 --> 00:57.160
Oh, John! I'm so proud!

00:57.160 --> 01:01.400
No longer be we pariahs in the town
but instead are posh,

01:01.400 --> 01:05.640
and thus can shove it up
whomsoever we please.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.320
Please, sir, are you a real soldier?

01:08.320 --> 01:11.320
Oh, the bravest, lad.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.720
I have slain a thousand Turks
in a single day

01:14.720 --> 01:17.480
and faced down the hordes
of Muscovy.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.320
How do you get to be a soldier?

01:19.320 --> 01:23.200
By talking complete Bolingbrokes,
apparently.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.440
The recruiting office is always
looking for smart lads, son.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.280
Your Queen needs you.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.680
I want to be a brave soldier,

01:32.680 --> 01:35.360
like Sergeant Dogberry
and all the men at Agincourt

01:35.360 --> 01:36.920
in Dad's brilliant new play.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.840
Then you'll need a sword, son.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.480
Can I have a hold of yours?

01:40.480 --> 01:41.720
No, it's mine!

01:42.800 --> 01:46.960
Bring ale! Bring pie!
Let all rejoice! Father is home.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.200
I wasn't expecting you, love.
Good journey?

01:50.200 --> 01:52.560
Astonishingly, no.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.320
I had hoped to pass some of the long
hours of travel in quiet slumber.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.440
Sadly, that small pleasure
was denied me,

02:00.440 --> 02:02.480
our coach driver having been
afflicted

02:02.480 --> 02:05.920
by a verbal version
of the liquid turding malady,

02:05.920 --> 02:08.800
announcing every stop as we
approached,

02:08.800 --> 02:11.840
cataloguing all those yet to come
as we departed,

02:11.840 --> 02:14.600
begging we take care
as we disembarked,

02:14.600 --> 02:17.960
reminding us to collect
our belongings,

02:17.960 --> 02:20.320
assuring us at every juncture

02:20.320 --> 02:24.240
that our comfort and safety
were his top priority,

02:24.240 --> 02:26.520
hoping we'd had a good journey.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.720
Eventually, I could stand
it no longer,

02:28.720 --> 02:31.040
and in loud and manly voice
did I declaim,

02:31.040 --> 02:33.080
"Well, I might have a good journey

02:33.080 --> 02:38.000
"if you'd cease your fatuous
drivelling and let me sleep!"

02:39.760 --> 02:41.640
Never heard another peep out of him.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.280
Yeah, cos he chucked us off and we

02:43.280 --> 02:45.480
had to walk from
Brightwell-cum-Sotwell.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.120
A moral victory, nonetheless.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.920
Not if you have to carry the bags.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.520
You do not have to carry them,
Botsky. You are paid to carry them.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.640
Anyway, home now
and I'm come in company.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.280
Sweet Kate is with me,

02:56.280 --> 02:58.960
and also the artist
formerly known as Marlowe.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.120
And me! I'm here, too.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.720
You do not get billing, Bottom.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.640
You'll have noticed,
in my histories,

03:05.640 --> 03:08.160
when Norfolk enters,
announcing he's come upon his hour

03:08.160 --> 03:10.240
with Manchester,
Suffolk and Norwich,

03:10.240 --> 03:13.400
adding that East Grinstead and
Billingsgate are expected shortly

03:13.400 --> 03:16.280
with news of Slough,
he does not add,

03:16.280 --> 03:19.760
"Plus the bloke who cooks my pie
and carries all my stuff."

03:20.880 --> 03:23.440
Servants go in the stage directions,
I'm afraid,

03:23.440 --> 03:28.120
along with minstrels, courtiers,
letter lords and the army of France.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.160
Sorry, Botsky, but you are an
italic.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.360
I resent that deeply.
I am English born and bred.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.360
Never mind him, Bottom.
Everyone's welcome here.

03:38.360 --> 03:43.440
You, too, Kate. And Mr Marlowe, RIP.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.680
Also Messrs Burbage, Condell and
Kempe are come a-visiting.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.240
Good day, Mrs Shakespeare, my lady.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.680
Don't worry, we're not staying.
Just popped in to pay our respects.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.640
Goodness! What's brought you all
to the country at once?

03:55.640 --> 03:59.480
Sweet air, Mrs Shakespeare.
The London fog is foul just now.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.040
So, we have accepted
some rural engagements to escape it.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.200
Good to get out of town,
play to real people, yeah?

04:06.200 --> 04:08.720
And I must write another play,

04:08.720 --> 04:11.800
and the reek in town be so fetid,
it precludes all concentration.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.440
Oysters be in season

04:13.440 --> 04:17.560
and lord and man alike do blow wind
and crack their cheeks.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.760
Tush, tush.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.920
Then 'tis pity you have left town,
lady, for so foul be your temper,

04:21.920 --> 04:24.000
it would make even the London air
seem sweet.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.880
Fie, fie, sirrah. A sweet compliment
from a man so sour.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.000
What's got into those two?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.760
Isn't it fascinating that they're
both such proud, witty people

04:33.760 --> 04:37.200
that the close proximity forced upon
them by Marlowe's fake death

04:37.200 --> 04:40.560
has resulted in this endless,
hilarious sparring?

04:40.560 --> 04:42.600
Not very hilarious, love.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.200
Could get a bit irritating, in fact.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.400
Ooh, I don't know, Dad.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.280
Two warring wits exchanging
a constant stream of arch puns,

04:50.280 --> 04:53.920
smug put-downs
and tortuously convoluted insults?

04:53.920 --> 04:57.360
Hard to see
how that could ever get irritating.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.920
Yes, didn't you do something similar
with your Shrew, Will,

04:59.920 --> 05:01.960
between Petruchio and Katherine?

05:01.960 --> 05:04.600
Which was very, very irritating.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.600
Got some lovely letters.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.760
From his mum.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.080
Well, we must to the tavern
where we rest tonight,

05:11.080 --> 05:13.000
for tomorrow, we play Birmingham.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.640
Oh, I do love Birmingham.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.400
Such a tiny, sweet,
fragrant little town.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.120
Yes, with a particularly sensible,

05:19.120 --> 05:22.320
efficient and user-friendly
road layout.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.840
Let's hope that never changes.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.360
Well, adieu, all. Adieu.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.120
Well, it's lovely to have you all.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.440
Hamnet, shift your arsington
and get your nose out of that play.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.160
There's chores to be done.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.960
He's reading your Henry V, son.
He loves it!

05:38.960 --> 05:41.440
Him and all London, Mrs S.
Been an absolute megahit.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.800
Tush, tush, sir.
State the obvious, why don't you?

05:43.800 --> 05:46.840
Fie, fie, lady.
And 'tis obvious you are a pain.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.000
- Tush, tush!
- Fie, fie!

05:48.000 --> 05:51.120
I finally got around
to writing my Henry V.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.760
Amazing how many hits
I've had called Henry.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.400
Sort of spooky, when you think
of it. Six so far.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.040
I mean, what were the odds?

05:59.040 --> 06:00.680
Add two Richards and a John,

06:00.680 --> 06:04.120
which were spin-offs,
and I've kind of...

06:04.120 --> 06:07.160
I've kind of invented a franchise.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.440
The Henry universe.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.840
A fantasy universe, Mr Shakespeare.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.040
Xenophobic, fake history
masquerading as truth.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.400
Enjoy it while you can, because
I can't see people long suffering

06:18.400 --> 06:21.400
such simplistic
and manipulative distortions

06:21.400 --> 06:25.080
in place of complex,
properly researched argument.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.400
Kind of think they might.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.720
Tush, tush, lady. Someone's
swallowed some very big words.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.400
Fie, fie, sirrah. I wish you would
swallow your tongue.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.760
Tush, tush, lady.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.040
Well, if you'd swallowed yours,
you would have a pain

06:39.040 --> 06:41.680
as well as being a pain, for such a
diet would make anyone sick.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.800
Fie, fie, sirrah!

06:42.800 --> 06:45.440
I actually think
I may have to kill myself.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends, once more

06:52.000 --> 06:56.240
"Or close the wall up
with our English dead."

06:56.240 --> 06:57.800
I hate that line. It's horrible.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.240
Hate it, my sweet?

06:59.240 --> 07:02.400
Well, he's actually telling his men
to charge into a gap in the wall

07:02.400 --> 07:05.240
and fill it up
with their slaughtered corpses.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.760
I do understand the image, my love.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.440
'Twas I who conjured it.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.600
Well, it's a good job you do, son,

07:12.600 --> 07:14.960
because when it comes to
your images,

07:14.960 --> 07:17.000
you're the only one who does.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.320
Well, that may be the case,
Father, but, weirdly,

07:19.320 --> 07:21.880
I've found that people don't
actually need to understand

07:21.880 --> 07:24.920
my images as they seem perfectly
happy just pretending to.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.200
I can't go. I just cannot go.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.960
I look completely
and utterly crapulous.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.760
What's all this?

07:33.760 --> 07:36.080
Sir Thomas Livesey's
giving a masked ball

07:36.080 --> 07:38.760
for the young people
at the church hall tonight

07:38.760 --> 07:41.760
and every maid and youth
must attend in disguise.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.000
Ooh, it's so romantic.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.440
I met your grandad
at just such a ball, Susanna.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.040
Spotted him across the room.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.840
Oh, a fearsome, ugly gargoyle face!

07:52.840 --> 07:55.360
How was I to know he'd forgotten
his mask?

07:57.360 --> 07:59.320
This was my chance
to go up to Claude,

07:59.320 --> 08:00.960
who I really want to get with,

08:00.960 --> 08:04.040
but I just can't now
cos my mask's too stupid.

08:04.040 --> 08:08.320
Oh, but it isn't. It's a lovely
mask, Sue. Wonderful.

08:08.320 --> 08:12.480
But perhaps if you let me make
a couple of tiny adjustments...

08:12.480 --> 08:16.000
Sue really likes this boy Claude,
and she's hoping that,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.200
from behind the
anonymity of her mask,

08:18.200 --> 08:21.560
she'll pluck the courage to ask him
if he wants to get with her.

08:21.560 --> 08:26.080
But I don't think even the mask will
help, because she's just too shy.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.280
Here, Sue. Is this a bit better?

08:30.880 --> 08:33.360
I mean, it's still mainly your work.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.039
Kate, it is amazing.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.559
You are so elegant and talented.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.720
I bet you'd know how
to ask a boy out.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.640
- Well, here's a thought. Why doesn't she?
- What?

08:44.640 --> 08:47.600
Well, why doesn't Kate go
to the masked ball in your stead

08:47.600 --> 08:50.480
and ask Claude
if he wants to get with her?

08:50.480 --> 08:52.760
Claude would think it was you.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.680
You see?

08:54.680 --> 08:56.600
Absolutely identical.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.960
Will you help me get with Claude,
Kate?

09:00.960 --> 09:03.040
Well, gosh! I don't know.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.960
We are talking about obtaining
sexual favours by deception here.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.240
There are huge issues
of morality and legality.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.640
I mean, if you get with him
having groomed him

09:12.640 --> 09:16.920
using my image and personality
profile, it's actually assault.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.280
Blimey, Kate! You're criminalising
half the plays I ever wrote.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.640
Just saying.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.520
But you will do it, though?
I mean, you are my mate?

09:28.160 --> 09:29.800
Oh, goodness!

09:29.800 --> 09:33.240
That is true, isn't it?
I am your mate, aren't I?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.640
I've got a girlie mate. Ha!

09:35.640 --> 09:38.800
Take that, Samantha, Ruby,
Deb, Cass, Gertrude, Pat

09:38.800 --> 09:40.720
and all the other bitchingtons.

09:40.720 --> 09:45.040
Who's Nelly No-Mates now?
Not me, because I've got one! Ha!

09:46.480 --> 09:48.040
Of course I'll do it, Sue.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.880
Impersonating one another at masked
balls is what mates are for.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.040
There's Claude in the pink doublet.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.800
Ain't he lush,
even with his mask on?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.720
Who's that he's with, Sue?

10:10.720 --> 10:14.840
That boy has a strange,
brooding and malevolent presence.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.080
That's Moll John's boy, Donald.
Don John.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.680
He hates to see anyone happy,

10:19.680 --> 10:22.720
so me and Claude copping off
would get right on his tittlingtons.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.600
Well, why does he wish you ill,
daughter?

10:24.600 --> 10:27.280
Oh, it ain't just me.
He's just generally wicked.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.200
Right, here I go.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.080
Where's Sue, then, Margaret?

10:32.080 --> 10:34.840
Oh, she's right lush, I reckon.
I wouldn't mind getting with her.

10:34.840 --> 10:38.520
Why, Claude, do you deny me?

10:38.520 --> 10:42.640
I am Susanna, come as promised.
Will you dance a little, sir?

10:42.640 --> 10:45.040
Blimey, Sue! You do sound posh.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.600
It don't half turn me on.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.680
It's working perfectly, Sue.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.280
Claude is clearly besotted
with Kate as you.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.760
And next time, it will be you,
not Kate, with whom he dances.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.160
[LAUGHTER]

11:06.160 --> 11:08.480
Oh, Mum, it worked brilliantly!

11:08.480 --> 11:10.880
Claude loves me
and he wants to get with me.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.200
That's what he said to Kate
when he thought she me.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.400
- Isn't that right, Kate?
- It certainly is.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.120
The sweet, lovesick fellow
even so far forgot himself

11:19.120 --> 11:22.040
as to inquire
if he could cop a bit of a feel-up.

11:23.720 --> 11:27.000
Which, of course, with maidenly
blushes half hidden behind my mask,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.320
I declined.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.120
Actually, that could have given
you away,

11:30.120 --> 11:32.320
cos I definitely would have let him.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.680
Here's your mask.
A souvenir of your first love.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.200
Tush, tush, madam.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.320
You should wear it still,
for I venture it improves your face,

11:41.320 --> 11:43.040
my dear Lady Disdain.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.440
Is it possible disdain should die

11:44.440 --> 11:47.600
when she hath such meet food
to feed it as Signor Marlowe?

11:47.600 --> 11:50.640
I had rather hear my dog bark
at a crow.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.680
Honestly, Will, you're going to have
to have a word with those two.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.560
Why do they have to be so mean?

11:55.560 --> 11:58.120
Methinks I see the reason, wife.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.920
They're in love,
but do deny it even unto themselves.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.880
In love? But they've been fighting.
They always do.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.280
That's the point.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.280
They be fiery, sparky opposites

12:08.280 --> 12:11.240
ever in denial about
the true nature of their feelings.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.920
All this verbal jousting
is just surrogate rumpy-pumpington.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.800
Well, I wish they'd hurry up

12:16.800 --> 12:18.760
and get to the real
rumpy-pumpington,

12:18.760 --> 12:20.680
because it's getting on my nerves.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.760
They need an intervention.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.440
I've sorted out Sue and Claude.
Now I'll sort out Kate and Kit.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.880
Husband, in the past, you said
you were against such a match.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.240
Remember their Italian adventure?

12:32.240 --> 12:35.000
And Marlowe's a shagsome,
bonking rodent...

12:36.960 --> 12:39.280
..who, rumour has it,

12:39.280 --> 12:42.320
prefers his maids with cod-dangles,
if you know what I mean.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.680
'Tis true that,
like the restless pendulum

12:46.680 --> 12:50.760
that marks the steps of Father Time,
Kit swingeth both ways.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.240
But 'tis clear he loves Kate.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.520
The problem is they're both
too proud to make the first move,

12:58.520 --> 13:02.600
thus must I trick each into thinking
that the other doth love.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.320
I shall bide my time.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.520
Tell me more, Kate.
Was I really romantic?

13:06.520 --> 13:09.400
Oh, yes, you were, Sue. So romantic.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.440
And Claude confessed he was
proper gutted when I had to leave.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.680
He made me promise to meet him
at the tavern for the after-ball.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.600
Mum, I'm off to the tavern!

13:17.600 --> 13:19.840
The tavern?! But you be but a maid!

13:19.840 --> 13:21.400
I'm 16.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.240
Juliet got married, consummated it
and killed herself by the time

13:24.240 --> 13:25.760
she was 13.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.840
Yeah, well, let's not dwell on that,
love, because, frankly,

13:30.840 --> 13:34.800
I've always thought your father
making Juliet only 13

13:34.800 --> 13:36.280
was a bit weird.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.160
It was not weird.

13:40.160 --> 13:44.080
I must say, it always bothered me
a bit, but I decided to ignore it.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.400
I think that's what people will do -
cast older actresses

13:46.400 --> 13:49.440
and probably cut the line
where it says about

13:49.440 --> 13:52.560
Juliet not having seen her
14th summer,

13:52.560 --> 13:55.880
because it really is a bit weird.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.440
It's not weird.

13:57.440 --> 14:01.280
It's a quite deliberately stylised
image of youth and innocence.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.720
It would be different if Romeo
were a dirty old pervington,

14:04.720 --> 14:06.680
but he's not, obviously.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.000
Why obviously?

14:09.000 --> 14:12.120
As I recall,
you never mention Romeo's age,

14:12.120 --> 14:15.320
although I can't be sure because,
by the middle of Act II,

14:15.320 --> 14:17.400
I was fast asleep.

14:17.400 --> 14:21.320
He doesn't. Romeo's age
is never mentioned in the play.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.560
What, so while Juliet
is definitely 13,

14:24.560 --> 14:28.120
Romeo could be, like,
55 and really creepy?

14:28.120 --> 14:30.040
No, he couldn't, Bottom.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.240
When I came up with
Romeo And Juliet...

14:32.240 --> 14:34.680
- Except you <i>didn't</i> come up with it, Mr Shakespeare.
- What?

14:34.680 --> 14:36.200
At first I thought you did,

14:36.200 --> 14:39.520
but then I read The Tragicall
Historye Of Romeus And Juliet,

14:39.520 --> 14:43.840
written two years before you were
born, in 1562, by Arthur Brooke,

14:43.840 --> 14:46.680
which is an almost identical
narrative to yours.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.160
How can you say that?

14:48.160 --> 14:52.000
Romeus is spelt completely
differently to Romeo, for a start.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.360
- And there is one other difference.
- You see?

14:54.360 --> 14:57.600
Brooke names Juliet as aged 16.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.680
So, you specifically made her

14:59.680 --> 15:02.960
younger than in your
source material?

15:02.960 --> 15:06.360
Juliet's age was the
only thing you changed?

15:06.360 --> 15:09.280
Now, that really is weird.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.280
It is not weird!

15:11.280 --> 15:13.280
Susanna was 13 when I wrote it

15:13.280 --> 15:17.680
and I wanted to doubly emphasise
the nature of the generation gap

15:17.680 --> 15:20.640
to make the innocent purity
ever more heartbreaking.

15:20.640 --> 15:24.320
The point is, I'm blooming 16
and I'm going to the pub!

15:24.320 --> 15:27.280
Kate's done the groundwork.
Now it's time to get stuck in.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.680
And I'll be off on my night watch.

15:29.680 --> 15:33.520
I might look in on you later, Sue.
You can buy me a pint.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.320
Don't you dare talk to me.
I'll be copping off with Claude.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.720
I don't want you spoiling it,

15:37.720 --> 15:39.840
making me look all crappage
and common-like.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.600
Well, now, perhaps after
all these distractions

15:42.600 --> 15:45.720
and silly discussions,
I can get on with my writing.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.000
After all, that is why I came here.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.640
Hamnet, pluck me a quill
from Mistress Clucky's arsington.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.520
'Tis time for another Henry.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.840
[CLUCKING AND FLAPPING]

15:57.840 --> 16:00.800
Is it going to be
full of battles again, Dad?

16:00.800 --> 16:02.240
It certainly is.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.000
If gentlemen in England now abed

16:04.000 --> 16:06.640
think themselves accursed
that they missed Agincourt,

16:06.640 --> 16:09.000
they're going to feel themselves
royally shafted

16:09.000 --> 16:11.520
to have missed all the battles
I'm going to write about

16:11.520 --> 16:14.480
in Henry V, Part II.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.680
Words have consequences, Will.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.080
Young men might die
because of your plays.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.000
Only if they get bored to death.

16:22.520 --> 16:26.000
- Right, I'm off on my night watch.
- My hero!

16:26.000 --> 16:29.640
When I get back,
you might like to polish my weapon.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.800
Oh!

16:30.800 --> 16:33.800
Always happy to oblige a gentleman.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.400
Mr Shakespeare,
the Battle of Agincourt was the peak

16:36.400 --> 16:38.600
of Henry V's military career.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.880
He had no great triumphs after that.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.960
He will now.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.040
Your histories
are not histories at all,

16:45.040 --> 16:46.640
just laughable propaganda

16:46.640 --> 16:49.400
designed to shore up the legitimacy
of the current monarchy.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.000
Duh.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.880
Tush, tush, lady.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.240
If thy face were
as fine as thy speech,

16:55.240 --> 16:57.440
it would be a pretty thing indeed.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.680
Fie, fie, sirrah!

16:58.680 --> 17:00.520
They're at it again
with the love jousting.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.320
I think it's time to bring
them together

17:02.320 --> 17:05.119
so that true love may blossom
and we can all have a bit of peace.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.720
Well, I'm going to smoke a pipe.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.200
I hope you have a tinder, sir,

17:09.200 --> 17:12.640
for you have no spark of wit
to light it.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.200
Tush, tush, lady.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.119
Be it ever unlit,
it's still hotter than you.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.000
Bottom, a word.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.200
You know that Kate and Marlowe have,
of late,

17:22.200 --> 17:25.800
taken to trading verbal blows
on a pretty much continuous basis?

17:25.800 --> 17:27.520
Erm, yeah. It's doing my head in.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.960
They're so sick of each other,
it's painful.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.840
No, not surprisingly,
being a servant,

17:31.840 --> 17:33.880
you have stupidly
misread the situation.

17:33.880 --> 17:37.520
This trading of abuse
means not that they hate each other,

17:37.520 --> 17:39.560
but that they love each other.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.240
You're joking me. Why?

17:41.240 --> 17:43.480
'Tis the nature
of the proud heart, Botsky.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.960
But now 'tis time
to bring these two hearts together.

17:46.960 --> 17:50.080
I intend to tell you,
in Marlowe's hearing,

17:50.080 --> 17:51.760
that Kate doth love him.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.960
You just go along
with whate'er I say.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.920
[CLEARS HIS THROAT]

17:56.920 --> 17:58.840
Gosh, Botsky!

17:58.840 --> 18:03.520
Have you seen the way
our Kate's been ogling Mr Marlowe?

18:03.520 --> 18:06.240
Oh, right. Yeah, absolutely.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.960
And you'd hear her sigh that she
loves him full passionately?

18:12.960 --> 18:17.280
Oh, yeah, I did. She sighed
big-time. Massive sighing.

18:17.280 --> 18:21.040
Blimey, that's a shocker.
Kate sighs for me?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.440
I thought she hated
my perky white arsington.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.680
It's working. I can hear him
sucking his pipe

18:25.680 --> 18:28.200
with gleeful eagerness.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.720
Now must we serve Kate likewise.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.000
Botsky, did you hear
how melancholy Mr Marlowe

18:35.000 --> 18:36.760
was as he sucked his pipe?

18:36.760 --> 18:38.400
So sadly did he suck.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.360
Saddest sucking I ever heard.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.920
He is a really sad sucker.

18:46.240 --> 18:50.960
Then did he whisper soft
the name of his true love.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.080
"Kate! Kate!" he quoth.

18:53.080 --> 18:58.000
"I love thee, yet have not the
courage to tell thee."

18:58.000 --> 19:01.240
Blimey, that's a shocker.
I thought he hated me.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.280
Brilliant. Thus emboldened
by the promise of requited passion,

19:04.280 --> 19:05.920
both will declare their love.

19:05.920 --> 19:10.000
Job done. Can't fail.
Love be truly all around.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.920
I feel it in my fingers.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.040
I feel it in my toes.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.320
Make way! Give air! Give air!
Make way!

19:18.320 --> 19:19.520
Sir, what ails her?

19:19.520 --> 19:22.520
Panic not, Mrs Shakespeare.
The maid hath but fainted.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.440
Fainted? But why?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.960
A dreadful confrontation in
the tavern, Mrs Shakespeare.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.400
Susanna was making merry
with a group of young people

19:29.400 --> 19:31.400
when a boy called Claude
did approach

19:31.400 --> 19:34.640
and defame her most vilely,
calling her a tarting-slap.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.320
My Sue, a tarting-slap?

19:36.320 --> 19:37.760
Never!

19:37.760 --> 19:38.920
Afraid so, Mrs S.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.040
Seems she was seen
snogging some other bloke

19:41.040 --> 19:42.840
and letting him cop a feel-up.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.480
But I never done it, Mum. I swear!

19:45.480 --> 19:46.920
Fear not, Susanna.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.120
You have been the
victim of a foul plot,

19:50.120 --> 19:54.760
which I, as master of the watch,
have uncovered.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.680
Tell them everything you told me.
Omit nothing.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.680
Omitting nothing, sir.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.960
I said, "Hello, Master Shakespeare.
'Tis a bit of a chilly night."

20:04.960 --> 20:08.320
You said, "Blooming chilly,
Master Dogberry.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.560
"'Twould freeze the Bolingbrokes
off..."

20:10.560 --> 20:15.920
When I said omit nothing,
I meant omit nothing important.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.000
You are...a ass.

What a hilarious confusion
of language.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.000
I wish I'd written it.

I'm sure, in time, you will.

there, I was watching everywhere.

did not exceed my duties, sir,

called Don John, sir,

boasting as how he had done a trick
by snogging up the sluttage Margaret

21:06.080 --> 21:09.920
but telling Claude as how he'd been
snogging up the chaste Susanna.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.880

and the whole village
will know of his slander.

Well, we must also take our leave.

It's so important to bring
arts to the regions.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.360
It's very culturally divisive

21:27.360 --> 21:30.360
that the entertainment industry
is so London-centric.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.320
Yeah. Like, mad culturally divisive.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.680
I agree.

Why should there not be a theatre
or production facility elsewhere?

for example?

21:40.160 --> 21:42.640
Except then we'd all be
horribly inconvenienced

21:42.640 --> 21:45.320
whenever we wanted to work there.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.960
Unless we moved, I suppose.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.800
Went to live in the North.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.360
Perhaps best left as it is.
So, we'll see you anon.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.160
- Good e'en. Good e'en.
- Thank you <i>so</i> much, Mr Burbage.

21:56.160 --> 21:59.800
Oh, well done, husband.
Brilliant police work.

21:59.800 --> 22:03.480
A rogue unmasked
and Susanna's name be cleared.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.680
And I can get my Claude back.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.480
This Claude must be taught a lesson
before he be welcomed back

22:08.480 --> 22:11.600
into the fold,
and I have a brilliant idea.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.040
Oh, God!

22:15.240 --> 22:20.800
We must tell him
that Sue did not faint, but died

22:20.800 --> 22:22.880
of a broken heart.

22:22.880 --> 22:26.520
Then will I, a stern father,
go to Claude and inform him that,

22:26.520 --> 22:30.920
as penance, he must get with
my niece Pru instead.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.400
Then, when Claude
comes here for Pru,

22:33.400 --> 22:36.360
he will find this Pru
all veiled because...

22:36.360 --> 22:38.840
- Bet you can't guess.
- It's <i>me</i>.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.480
Oh, you did guess. Well, yes,
you will reveal yourself as Sue,

22:43.480 --> 22:45.400
Claude will have been
taught his lesson,

22:45.400 --> 22:48.080
you will take him back
and all will be love and joy.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.760
I think you should sleep on it.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.200
Come on, kids.
Judith, you shouldn't still be up.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.760
And Hamnet. Hamnet!

22:53.760 --> 22:55.600
Hamnet! Hamnet!

22:57.280 --> 22:59.160
Hamnet's run away!

22:59.160 --> 23:01.720
Boy missing?
This is a job for the watch.

23:01.720 --> 23:05.200
He's not missing.
I know exactly where he's gone.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.360
It's you and your stupid
blooming play, Will,

23:08.360 --> 23:10.800
exciting the boy about war.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.920
I'll be back.

23:18.520 --> 23:21.520
Well, Master Shakespeare,
you have made your mark

23:21.520 --> 23:24.440
that you will serve your Queen
for seven years.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.280
Yes, sir.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.320
Suspect, lad! Big suspect!

23:28.320 --> 23:31.080
Hamnet, what are you doing here?

23:31.080 --> 23:34.960
I'm going to be a soldier.
I want to die in the breach.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.040
Last time you were in the breach,
it was me nearly died,

23:38.040 --> 23:40.280
and I didn't go through
14 hours of labour

23:40.280 --> 23:42.880
to have you throw your life away.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.840
There's nothing to a battle, lad.
Just takes balls.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
And when his have dropped,
I'll let you know.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.200
Oh, Mum!

23:49.200 --> 23:52.000
Don't dis-suspect me, madam.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.520
I have fought with Frederick
in the German forests.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.640
I doubt it.

23:56.640 --> 24:00.000
But if you had, you would have seen
what a bear's prepared to do

24:00.000 --> 24:02.040
to defend her young.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.560
I'm mumma bear.

24:04.880 --> 24:08.840
Right. Well, in that case,
run along, lad.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.400
You, exit.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.560
Pursued by bear.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.680
[COCKEREL CROWS]

24:18.680 --> 24:23.160
And if you ever risk your life
again, I'll blooming well kill you.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.000
Such joy!

24:26.000 --> 24:28.360
And look how pretty Susanna is

24:28.360 --> 24:31.760
with Claude coming to collect her
for a gadsome datelington.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.440
So romantic,

24:33.440 --> 24:35.360
even if he does think he's coming
to collect

24:35.360 --> 24:37.360
her fictitious cousin Pru.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.600
It's all working perfectly, Anne.

24:39.600 --> 24:43.480
And look-see
how my other romantic plan develops.

24:43.480 --> 24:47.000
Kit and Kate do exchange shy glances
and winsome sighs.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.320
Both seeking ways
of declaring their affection.

24:52.320 --> 24:56.400
Soon, the bantering will be replaced
with sweet words of love.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.640
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

24:59.800 --> 25:01.520
Hello, Claude.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.600
Hello, Mrs Shakespeare.
Hello, Mr Shakespeare.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.640
Sorry about slagging off your Sue

25:08.640 --> 25:11.760
and causing her to die
of shame and sadness, like.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.880
Well, I'm surprised
you've got the Bolingbrokes

25:13.880 --> 25:15.680
to show your face around here
at all.

25:15.680 --> 25:19.720
Well, Mr Shakespeare said
I had to cop off with his niece Pru.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.320
You, in.

25:25.640 --> 25:29.920
And now will Sue reveal herself,
she and Claude will dance merrily,

25:29.920 --> 25:32.720
Kit will reveal his love to Kate,
she to him,

25:32.720 --> 25:35.440
and all will be love,
sweetness and light.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.480
Pru, I'm Claude.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.800
I've come to get with you
instead of dead Sue.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.400
Hello, Claude.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.840
Oh, my God. You're alive.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.760
I can't believe it!

25:49.760 --> 25:52.360
And you look really lush and all.
Can I get with you?

25:52.360 --> 25:53.960
Come here!

25:53.960 --> 25:56.680
Lovely. He'll be down on one knee
before you know it.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.920
Or both knees, Dad.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.560
[CLAUDE GROANS]

26:02.040 --> 26:04.840
First, you call me a sluttage
in front of the whole town,

26:04.840 --> 26:07.800
and now, with me only dead a day,
you want to cop off

26:07.800 --> 26:10.000
with my fictitious cousin Pru!

26:10.000 --> 26:12.600
I hate you, Claude. I thought I
loved you, but I hate you.

26:12.600 --> 26:16.080
So, go and cop a feel off Margaret,
if she'll have you.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.640
You're all blooming bonkers!

26:21.720 --> 26:24.600
Plan going well so far, master?

26:24.600 --> 26:28.960
Well, I admit that bit
didn't quite go as I imagined,

26:28.960 --> 26:30.960
but love is still in the air.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.880
- Kate?
- Yes, Mr Marlowe?

26:37.880 --> 26:41.040
Thing is, I know.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.200
I know, too, Mr Marlowe.
I overheard Mr Shakespeare.

26:44.200 --> 26:48.320
Same, and what I'm trying to say is,
while I think you're very nice...

26:48.320 --> 26:51.760
- I don't even think you're very nice.
- What?

26:51.760 --> 26:57.360
I know you love me,
but I truly, deeply do not love you.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.280
Hang on, I don't love you.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.960
- Will said...
- But Mr Shakespeare...

27:05.800 --> 27:08.120
Plan still going well,
is it, master?

27:09.440 --> 27:12.080
But if you don't secretly
love each other,

27:12.080 --> 27:14.680
why have you been trading
arch and impish insults

27:14.680 --> 27:16.400
these many weeks?

27:16.400 --> 27:18.800
Erm, because
we're really sick of each other.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.640
Deeply irritated.

27:20.640 --> 27:24.240
So, not to disguise
a secret love at all, then?

27:24.240 --> 27:26.720
In what universe does
exchanging insults indicate

27:26.720 --> 27:28.920
secret love, Mr Shakespeare?

27:28.920 --> 27:32.560
Only in his tortuous
and convoluted one, dear.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.440
It's why he's a genius.

27:39.280 --> 27:42.640
I shan't write Henry V, Part II.

27:42.640 --> 27:46.320
Having seen the way we nearly lost
our beloved Hamnet to be a soldier,

27:46.320 --> 27:50.760
I have no stomach for plays
that speak of war and glory.

27:50.760 --> 27:53.400
To be honest, I think
I'm pretty much done with histories.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.640
I mean, if nothing else,
I'm almost out of Henrys.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.120
Then what will you write, love?

27:59.120 --> 28:01.360
Well, how about another
romantic comedy?

28:01.360 --> 28:05.200
Well, people do love them.
But what plot will you use?

28:05.200 --> 28:07.320
Why, the one that's been happening
all around us.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.800
I shall use it all
just exactly as it happened,

28:09.800 --> 28:11.400
right here in this house.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.440
And at the end, will you have the
two bickering lovers

28:14.440 --> 28:18.160
being revealed as actually being
genuinely sick of each other,

28:18.160 --> 28:22.240
and the veiled girl knee her
ex-boyfriend in the scroting sack?

28:22.240 --> 28:24.720
No, of course not.
They'll all get married, obviously.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.280
[CHUCKLES]
You're the genius, love,

28:27.280 --> 28:30.120
but it don't sound like
much of a play to me.

28:30.120 --> 28:33.160
More like a load
of convoluted old Bolingbrokes.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.880
Just much ado about nothing, really.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.360
Boom! There's the title right there
-

28:38.360 --> 28:41.440
A Load Of Convoluted Old
Bolingbrokes.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.400
I feel another hit coming on.
