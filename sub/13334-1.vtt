WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:01.468
.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.343
Last time in Newcastle was amazing.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.647
And then Marnie came in
and messed everything up.

00:14.714 --> 00:16.181
It's Marnie!

00:16.248 --> 00:17.584
Bitch.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.419
She snapped the family in half.

00:19.486 --> 00:20.987
She's a slut!

00:21.921 --> 00:24.190
Me and Gary ended up arguing
over a girl.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.760
We had a falling out.

00:26.826 --> 00:28.862
Shut the fuck up!
You little slut!

00:28.928 --> 00:30.196
It was World War Three.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.198
Oh, shit!

00:32.265 --> 00:34.667
She goes or I fucking go!
Boom!

00:34.734 --> 00:35.935
I ain't coming back.

00:36.002 --> 00:39.439
I got my pulling crown back.
It was mint.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.576
More comings and goings
than a kebab shop in the Toon.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.445
Vicky left. She won't be back.

00:45.512 --> 00:48.882
Me and Charlotte fell out
because her boyfriend was a prick.

00:48.948 --> 00:51.384
I really wish things
had gone differently.

00:54.053 --> 00:57.023
God knows
what's gonna happen this time.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.926
The Geordies are back in the Toon.
Wicked!

01:01.127 --> 01:03.029
I'm back. Have you missed me?

01:03.096 --> 01:05.865
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

01:05.932 --> 01:09.169
This time around
it's gonna be amazing.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.304
We are doing what we do best.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.672
Fuck me!
Partying.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.009
Tashing on.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.078
Flirting.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.814
Getting mortal.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.415
(burps)

01:22.482 --> 01:25.051
Shagging.
Whoo!

01:26.986 --> 01:28.288
It's gonna kick off.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.960
I hate everyone.
Some things never change.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.495
No, no!

01:35.562 --> 01:37.063
(yells)

01:37.130 --> 01:38.865
No!

01:38.932 --> 01:40.066
It's insane.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.975
No!
I can't fucking wait.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.014
(yells)

01:56.449 --> 01:57.917
Shit's about to get real.

01:57.984 --> 01:59.953
I'm a pineapple!

02:01.688 --> 02:03.957
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.125
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.561
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.763
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.066
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:13.132 --> 02:16.736
Hardest graft I've done is my hair.
I'm colourful, full of mischief.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.006
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:20.073 --> 02:23.910
I'm gonna get everyone feisty.
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:35.889 --> 02:39.392
I'm back and I'm brunette
and I've got a new party trick.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.330
Are you excited? I'm nervous, just
cos of how everything left last time.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.099
Is Charlotte coming back?

02:46.165 --> 02:48.201
I don't know what the crack is.

02:48.268 --> 02:51.437
Last time she left,
it was obviously because of Mitch.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.507
Me and Charlotte argued
for the first time over a boy

02:54.574 --> 02:57.176
and I felt like she left
and deserted me for him.

02:57.243 --> 03:00.179
I don't know if Vicky's gonna
come back. I hope she does.

03:00.246 --> 03:04.183
Like, the only person who
I'm gonna speak to... Marnie.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.487
Last time, me and Marnie ended up
fighting like cat and dog.

03:07.554 --> 03:08.922
She was the dog.

03:08.988 --> 03:12.892
This time she's not any threat to me,
I'm just going in to have fun.

03:12.959 --> 03:16.229
New beginning, I'm gonna be nice.
Hopefully she'll be nice

03:16.296 --> 03:18.464
and we can get along
like best friends.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.467
Oh.
(both) Hmm.

03:24.003 --> 03:26.039
Last time, Marnie blagged my head.

03:27.273 --> 03:30.109
This time, the old Scotty T is back,
come on!

03:30.176 --> 03:33.179
If a new girl walks in,
after what happened with Marnie,

03:33.246 --> 03:35.048
I'll probs stay away.

03:35.114 --> 03:37.517
Actually, no,
I'd still try and shag her.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.454
Me and Gaz fell out over a bird.

03:41.521 --> 03:43.957
That's not happening again.
He's me brother.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.092
(phone rings)

03:46.159 --> 03:47.694
Gaz.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.829
Oi, oi, kid, how you doing?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.966
Aye, have you missed us, kid?
"(laughs)"

03:57.236 --> 03:59.472
Oh, what surprise, can you tell us?

04:01.207 --> 04:03.509
I love surprises, but I hate them.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.479
What the fuck's he done, like?
Washed his cock for once?

04:14.520 --> 04:17.322
Last time around,
I felt completely on my own.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.524
I just hope this time
it's different.

04:19.591 --> 04:23.229
I hope that the girls
just go easy on us this time. Yeah.

04:23.296 --> 04:26.065
Maybe I should just try
and build bridges with them.

04:26.132 --> 04:29.268
I'm hoping there's no new boy.
That'll make it difficult.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.537
If the only way of
getting on with the girls

04:31.604 --> 04:34.540
is staying away from the boys,
that's what I have to do.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.410
I hope that I can be considered
as part of the family

04:37.477 --> 04:39.345
and not an outsider.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.921
I'm all packed
and ready to get in that house,

04:48.988 --> 04:50.923
and I've got a massive surprise.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.754
So, I get to the house
and I cannot wait to see everyone.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.957
Oh, my God.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.793
(gasps) And no-one's there.

05:32.198 --> 05:35.768
I may as well get this party started,
be rude not to.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.504
I can't reach.

05:38.571 --> 05:39.839
Yeah.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.175
I go into the shag pad,
I'm looking around.

05:42.241 --> 05:45.545
Oh, this is cute.
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, my God!

05:45.611 --> 05:47.680
And it's only a fucking water bed.

05:47.747 --> 05:51.451
If I was having sex on this bed,
I would have sea sickness.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.953
Whoa, it's like I'm surfing!

05:58.424 --> 06:00.827
I'm about to walk into the house.

06:00.893 --> 06:04.630
I'm feeling nervous, but I'm
so excited to see who's in there.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.568
Hello?

06:08.634 --> 06:10.770
I walk in and there's no-one there

06:12.004 --> 06:16.209
and I walk into the shag pad and
find Holly bouncing on a waterbed.

06:16.275 --> 06:19.445
I'm so anxious about seeing Holly,
cos last time in the house

06:19.512 --> 06:22.782
nothing got resolved, so I just
don't know how it's gonna go.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.385
Oh, my... it's a waterbed.
Jump on it. Jump on it.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.020
Oh, my God.

06:28.087 --> 06:31.758
Marnie's the next to arrive. Seeing
it's Marnie instead of Charlotte

06:31.824 --> 06:34.460
has just made all this fun disappear.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.163
Do you want a drink?
Yes, I'd love one.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.401
The house is nice, innit?
Yeah, so nice.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.804
Holly actually seems
happy to see us.

06:44.871 --> 06:47.106
Hopefully this'll be
the end of our drama.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.909
I'm staying away from boys.
Sing it to me, sister.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.678
No, I said, I wanna have fun
with the girls this time,

06:52.745 --> 06:54.614
that's gonna be priority this one.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.384
Marnie staying away from the boys
is like me saying I never suck cock.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.363
The next in the door is Scott.
He comes straight over

07:10.429 --> 07:14.600
and gives me this massive cuddle.
This is awkward.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.002
Holly's got normal hair.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.805
Makes a change from
looking like a fucking rainbow.

07:18.871 --> 07:22.508
So, you two, what's going on?

07:22.575 --> 07:24.210
Friends, aren't we?
Aye.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.078
Friends?
Aye, we are.

07:26.145 --> 07:28.147
Last time, Marnie blagged my head

07:28.214 --> 07:31.584
and she pure snapped
the Geordie Shore family in half.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.452
Me and Scott ended really badly,

07:33.519 --> 07:35.855
I just hope that it's not
gonna be awkward.

07:35.922 --> 07:40.159
No bird dramas,
Marnie can suck us off. Whoo!

07:41.994 --> 07:45.798
So I've got to the house, buzzing,
and I can't wait to see their faces.

07:53.105 --> 07:54.907
You all right? What's happening?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.642
I've got a little surprise.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.644
(screams)

08:01.447 --> 08:06.686
Kate's the new housemate?
Is he having a fucking laugh?

08:06.752 --> 08:09.288
What the hell?

08:09.355 --> 08:12.925
The last thing I wanna do is live
with his girlfriend, who hates me.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.093
How's it going?

08:14.160 --> 08:17.029
Holly's face doesn't look pleased
that Kate's here.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.998
I thought all that was in the past.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.868
Has anything changed?
A fucking waterbed in there.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.803
Waterbed? Shut up, man.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.771
I couldn't be happier to see Kate.

08:25.838 --> 08:29.842
It's a totally different story
for Holly, and her face says it all.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.447
Was it?

08:34.513 --> 08:38.183
Who wants to live with the girlfriend
of the lad they used to get with?

08:38.251 --> 08:40.519
What are we gonna talk about,
James's knob?

08:40.586 --> 08:42.788
(laughs)

08:47.693 --> 08:48.694
Haway, man.

08:48.761 --> 08:52.265
Do you think I'd let me girlfriend
stay in that house? Are you mad?

08:54.066 --> 08:55.601
What's happening?

08:57.069 --> 09:01.107
How do you feel? Are you all right?
Yeah, well...

09:01.173 --> 09:03.276
We were only joking,
she's not staying.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.646
You're not staying?
No.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.581
It's all a massive lie. Eh?

09:08.648 --> 09:09.982
(laughs)

09:10.049 --> 09:12.785
What the hell?
We were just doing it for a laugh.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.053
Thank fuck for that.

09:15.187 --> 09:18.291
Fucking hell, James,
your banter is lifting.

09:18.357 --> 09:23.095
Come here, you. Don't cry.
It's gonna be all right.

09:23.162 --> 09:25.598
I know, hopefully I'll see you soon.
Yeah?

09:25.665 --> 09:28.467
I know it was all a joke
about Kate coming in,

09:28.534 --> 09:31.170
but now I actually wish
she could stay.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.607
I spoke to Gaz
when I was on me way.

09:34.674 --> 09:38.811
He was like, "I'm gonna come later
on. I've got a surprise for yous."

09:43.749 --> 09:45.918
Scott tells us
Gary's got a surprise.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.521
Me and Holly
have finally smoothed things out.

09:48.587 --> 09:51.557
I hope it's not a boy
who's gonna fuck our friendship up.

09:54.493 --> 09:58.164
I thought everyone would be here.
I'm shocked there's no-one here.

09:58.230 --> 10:01.334
Where's Vicky and Charlotte?
I don't know what's going on.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.069
Where are Vicky and Charlotte?

10:03.135 --> 10:06.305
Lasses take forever getting ready,
but this takes the piss.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.940
What about you and Marnie?

10:08.007 --> 10:10.710
I'm a mystery man, honestly,
I'm literally like...

10:13.012 --> 10:14.613
Holly is asking about Marnie

10:14.680 --> 10:17.283
because she wants to be on
the other end of me pole.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.919
If you get really pissed
one night, horny...

10:19.986 --> 10:22.321
I would never have sex
with you ever again.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.490
What you saying?
I'm sassy as fuck now.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.026
What does that mean?
Sassy? (clicks fingers)

10:27.093 --> 10:29.295
Just because
I got over my cock fright

10:29.362 --> 10:32.131
doesn't mean I'm bucking everyone.
I'm sassy now.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.734
Halfway between a slut and classy.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.375
Everyone got a drink?
Yeah, yeah. Right.

10:42.441 --> 10:44.210
There's just the four of us here.

10:44.276 --> 10:47.279
Gary's coming later.
Charlotte's sucking Mitch off,

10:47.346 --> 10:49.248
and I have no idea where Vicky is.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.217
Cheers to the first night.

10:51.283 --> 10:54.253
All that's left for us to do
is go out and get mortal.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.789
(retches)
Argh!

10:56.856 --> 10:58.357
(screams)

11:04.397 --> 11:08.934
The Geordies are back in the Toon,
and there's nay place I'd rather be.

11:12.605 --> 11:16.575
You used to do this.
(laughs)

11:16.642 --> 11:18.244
Go on, lad!

11:22.681 --> 11:24.150
It's hard to get out!

11:29.088 --> 11:33.325
That's a lie, Scott. You've never
squirted anything in my face before.

11:36.328 --> 11:39.031
This is definitely gonna be
a good night.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.403
Holly's smashed,
Marnie's all over the place.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.272
Where Gaz, the little hedgehog?

11:54.713 --> 11:58.384
James is practically married.
Scott was a fanny last time.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.919
I am not taking any risks.

11:59.985 --> 12:02.655
We need testosterone
and I'm bringing my mate in.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.857
Ready?
Yeah. Let's do this.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.661
Rock up to where everyone is and I
can't wait to show them the surprise.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.297
Aye, aye.
Oh, my God.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.566
Who the hell is that?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.502
I recognise him.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.803
We've already shagged.

12:18.804 --> 12:23.175
He's gorgeous. He's got tattoos
down his arms, tattoos on his neck.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.944
Looks like a colouring book.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.245
He's too hot.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.647
I'm buzzing
to get into Geordie Shore.

12:28.714 --> 12:31.117
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:33.486 --> 12:33.686
.

12:36.322 --> 12:36.522
.

12:52.505 --> 12:55.708
James is practically married.
Scott was a fanny last time.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.143
I am not taking any risks.

12:57.209 --> 13:00.079
We need some testosterone
and I'm bringing my mate in.

13:06.519 --> 13:10.222
My name's Aaron. I'm absolutely
buzzing to get into Geordie Shore.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.193
Gaz is one of me best mates.
We share everything, even birds.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.697
Me and Holly know each other well.
From the noises she made,

13:18.764 --> 13:21.167
she'll be the one
with the smile on her face.

13:22.935 --> 13:27.173
Rock up to where everyone is and I
can't wait to show them the surprise.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.408
Aye, aye.
Oh, my God.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.477
Who the hell is that?

13:31.544 --> 13:33.345
Aye, aye.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.447
Nice to see you, kid.

13:35.514 --> 13:38.450
Gaz has shown up with a surprise
and it's his mate Aaron.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.720
I recognise him.
We've already shagged.

13:41.787 --> 13:43.656
Are you all right?
Oh, God.

13:43.722 --> 13:45.424
Yeah, I'm good.
Looking well.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.494
It's nice to meet everyone
and Holly's looking unreal.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.062
So is the girl next to her.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.031
All right.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.237
Aaron is gorgeous.

13:58.304 --> 14:02.374
He's got tattoos down his arms,
tattoos on his neck.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.143
Like a fucking colouring book.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.544
(laughter)

14:05.611 --> 14:08.447
Everyone seems pleased to see us,
especially Holly.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.816
Let's get my first night
off with a bang.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.053
Whenever a new person walks in,

14:14.119 --> 14:16.722
one thing to do,
get them fucking hammered.

14:16.789 --> 14:21.293
Welcome to the Geordie Shore house.
Cheers for having us. Let's go.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.696
Oh, my God.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.398
Yeah, he's hot. He's really nice.
He's too hot.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.400
Such a nice person
and you know what?

14:28.467 --> 14:30.135
I've already shagged him.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.906
Surprise, surprise, I find out
Holly's already bedded him. Typical.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.612
Marnie's asking
the size of his cock.

14:39.678 --> 14:42.114
Obviously planning on
going there later.

14:44.283 --> 14:47.086
I can't remember when he put
his balls in my mouth.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.320
You tea bagged him?

14:48.387 --> 14:51.090
Ah!
Yeah, I love a good old teabag.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.691
I love a teabag.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.698
Got a new lad,
so it's time to hit House of Smith

14:59.765 --> 15:01.133
and show him how to party.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.275
Let's get this party started.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.852
This is unreal. Tunes are pumping,
drinks are flowing

15:19.918 --> 15:23.389
and everyone's proper friendly.
I reckon I could get used to this.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.393
It's nice to see Aaron, clothed.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.732
Me and Aaron are getting along great,

15:33.799 --> 15:36.135
but he's saying he wouldn't
shag me again.

15:36.201 --> 15:37.903
We all know that's not true.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.273
Oh!
You wish.

15:49.948 --> 15:53.452
Plan was to pull Holly, but Marnie's
all over us, stroking me tats.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.888
Looks like there's another option.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.927
Aaron's having a crack with Marnie.

16:01.994 --> 16:05.397
Fuck it, I'm putting me foot down.
Marnie, come here.

16:10.069 --> 16:13.505
Gary's daring us to neck on
with him. What the fuck?

16:16.208 --> 16:17.643
I may as well.

16:25.050 --> 16:29.822
What the fuck is going on?
Gary and Marnie have just kissed.

16:29.888 --> 16:34.960
It's something I've wanted to do for
ages but finally I've done it. Tick.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.763
I was supposed to be
staying away from boys.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.565
What is Charlotte gonna say?

16:45.771 --> 16:47.406
Charlotte's not even here.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.008
No-one has a hold over me
in this house anymore.

16:53.045 --> 16:55.280
I can do what I want
and so can Marnie.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.250
I've always known Gaz
wanted to get into Marnie,

16:58.317 --> 17:01.820
but he is breaking lad code. I can't
wait for Charlotte to be single

17:01.887 --> 17:03.789
so I can crack the fuck on with her.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.657
Whether it's my bed, the sink,

17:06.724 --> 17:09.361
the shower or that waterbed,
we're spooning.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.536
Ready to crack on to Holly. Scott's
on one side I'm on the other.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.204
It's like fucking tug of war.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.776
It must be the fact that Holly
has got new hair and new tits.

17:23.842 --> 17:29.214
I'm so confused because, on one side,
I've got Aaron who's all over me,

17:29.281 --> 17:32.117
and on the other side,
I've got Scott who's all over me,

17:32.184 --> 17:34.586
and I'm not used to
all this male attention.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.960
Holly is loving the attention.

17:42.027 --> 17:44.863
She pretends she's not,
but she definitely is.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.199
Look there.
Oh, sorry.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.402
These boys are getting on my nerves,
I just wanna get home.

17:50.469 --> 17:53.305
Holly is having
the best taxi ride of her life.

17:53.372 --> 17:56.275
I hope when we get back home
we end up moosing her.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.647
We get back,
there's no messing around,

18:01.713 --> 18:05.517
I'm getting Marnie straight in
that shag pad to commence spooning.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.220
I end up in the shag pad with Gary,

18:08.287 --> 18:11.557
and I was supposed to being good
and staying away from the boys.

18:11.623 --> 18:12.825
Oh, yeah.

18:12.891 --> 18:16.428
I go in to say goodnight to Scott
and he tries to drag me into his bed.

18:16.495 --> 18:17.963
No, you don't.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.867
Scott can't have me
whenever he wants.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.503
I'm not there for
the taking anymore.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.642
I didn't think I'd be fighting
for Holly's attention.

18:32.077 --> 18:35.681
Sat in bed and I hear somebody
come in and it's Aaron.

18:37.115 --> 18:41.987
And he's trying to get into my bed.
No! Fucking idiot, get out!

18:44.590 --> 18:48.060
We're kissing and next thing I know
it's like... (whistle).

18:48.126 --> 18:50.562
(whistle)

18:52.831 --> 18:53.966
Night-night.

18:54.032 --> 18:55.634
(Marnie chuckles)

19:09.815 --> 19:11.083
(grunts)

19:12.284 --> 19:14.853
All right, lads?
Are you all right?

19:14.920 --> 19:18.824
Aye-aye, how's the fucking new lad,
like? Are you all right?

19:18.891 --> 19:22.261
First night in the house was
a success, got on with everyone,

19:22.327 --> 19:25.397
but I drank far too much
and I feel really hungover.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.770
You were both, like, fucking...

19:36.808 --> 19:40.679
I've woke up and I'm in the shag pad
with Gary. Shit.

19:45.484 --> 19:48.954
It barely touched the opening
and that is not classed as sex.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.060
(laughs) Morning.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.663
I go see Holly
because I fancy a little snuggle.

19:57.729 --> 20:01.733
Move over.
I feel like shit.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.869
I feel really rough.
How do you feel?

20:03.936 --> 20:08.373
I feel good that like everyone was
sound as fuck, but I feel rough.

20:08.440 --> 20:12.444
It's Aaron's first morning.
He might have fitted in really well.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.813
That doesn't mean to say
he can get in my bed.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.616
What about you last night then?
What do you mean me?

20:17.683 --> 20:20.252
Mrs Popular.
Last night was a nightmare.

20:20.319 --> 20:23.522
Scott on one side, Aaron on
the other. They need to realise,

20:23.589 --> 20:25.824
they can't get sassy Holly
that easily.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.194
I need some more girls in here
because I just can't deal with it.

20:30.796 --> 20:33.498
I'm so upset that Vicky
and Charlotte aren't here.

20:33.565 --> 20:37.002
I don't know when they're coming.
They need to hurry the fuck up.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.604
Coming for breakfast?
No.

20:38.670 --> 20:41.506
Yes, give us a kiss.
I don't wanna come with you.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.809
Come on.
Oh.

20:51.950 --> 20:55.654
Scott's cooking breakfast, but
not a chance I'm eating that.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.923
It looks like he's had
a turd on me plate.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.328
Everyone does say, we'll eat
healthy, do this, do that

21:03.395 --> 21:05.030
and it just goes out the window.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.438
I think this time
we should set a goal.

21:13.505 --> 21:15.540
We should do a fitness challenge.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.376
It's definitely not my thing.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.145
James is telling us that
we've got to have a goal.

21:20.212 --> 21:24.816
All I wanna do is shove a big sausage
in my face. (burps)

21:24.883 --> 21:26.084
(laughs)

21:26.151 --> 21:29.721
What I'm thinking is a long assault
course with massive obstacles

21:29.788 --> 21:31.456
and fire and tunnels and shit.

21:31.523 --> 21:34.760
If we're gonna do this and be
serious, we better get to the gym.

21:34.826 --> 21:37.095
You ready? Yous coming?
No.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.398
No? We'll start tomorrow.
Not right now.

21:39.464 --> 21:43.201
Me and the lads are off to the gym
to kill two birds with one stone.

21:43.268 --> 21:46.872
Get fit for the fitness challenge
and get fucking massive.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.721
James's face last night was amazing.

22:02.788 --> 22:06.324
The last people he expected to see
kissing was me and Marnie.

22:06.391 --> 22:09.728
First night and all.
I was pissed, just necking on her.

22:09.795 --> 22:11.930
So what do you
reckon's gonna happen?

22:13.865 --> 22:15.200
Right.

22:18.770 --> 22:22.441
Me and Marnie know each other.
She understands what I'm like.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.277
We do not want it
to get complicated.

22:26.244 --> 22:28.613
Could be landing yourself
in some trouble.

22:36.321 --> 22:38.156
What the fuck happened last night?

22:38.223 --> 22:41.293
I don't know,
he was like a friend to us.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.428
Yous were necking on.
Just necking on.

22:43.495 --> 22:44.930
Marnie needs to be careful.

22:44.996 --> 22:48.200
Although Gary's made of stone,
we all know that girls aren't.

22:48.266 --> 22:50.936
It's nothing like
what it was like with Charlotte.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.237
Yeah, no, God, no.
No.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.139
You wouldn't want it.
No.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.941
I know that people in the house

22:56.007 --> 22:58.577
think it's gonna get dramatic
with me and Gary,

22:58.643 --> 23:01.012
but it isn't like that with us.

23:05.250 --> 23:08.453
(doorbell rings)
(Scott) Who's that?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.288
Oh, my God, is it Charlotte?

23:10.355 --> 23:12.023
(all) Oh!

23:12.090 --> 23:14.626
It's Anna. What is she gonna
have us doing?

23:14.693 --> 23:16.261
More tanned every time.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.063
Looks like a fucking Satsuma.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.966
I hope everybody's making Aaron
feel welcome, are we?

23:21.032 --> 23:22.067
(all) Yes.

23:22.134 --> 23:27.372
Good. Considering you're completely
crap at everything else,

23:27.439 --> 23:31.042
we've decided to stick to what
you're good at and what you know.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.678
What's that?
It's Geordie Tours.

23:33.745 --> 23:37.682
It's just a limo bus, hen parties
and showing people how to party,

23:37.749 --> 23:39.518
one thing we know how to do.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.653
I want working tonight,

23:41.720 --> 23:45.323
Scott, Aaron and Holly.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.125
(they laugh)

23:47.192 --> 23:50.762
I've gotta go to work with people
who were playing tug of war with me.

23:50.829 --> 23:54.132
No necking on at all
with the clients.

23:54.199 --> 23:55.333
No necking on.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.203
I don't even know
why Anna even bothers anymore.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.105
Of course I'm gonna be necking on.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.574
And behave. OK?
All right.

24:02.641 --> 24:05.477
I can't believe my job is
taking people on a bar crawl

24:05.544 --> 24:07.846
and getting them pissed.
This is unreal.

24:07.913 --> 24:11.149
But most importantly, we have
a birthday boy in the room.

24:11.216 --> 24:12.450
Yes.

24:12.517 --> 24:15.821
So, I've decided you can have
a party tomorrow night.

24:15.887 --> 24:16.922
(cheering)

24:16.988 --> 24:18.957
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow? Yes.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.358
Oh, my God!

24:20.425 --> 24:22.093
I was my birthday a few days ago.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.096
I'm buzzing that I get a party
with Geordie Shore mates.

24:25.163 --> 24:27.566
Thanks, Anna.
Cheerio. Bye.

24:27.632 --> 24:32.237
I've got a really good idea for a
fancy dress theme. Pimps and hos.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.941
Girls wearing next to nothing
and lads dressed as pimps, perfect.

24:36.007 --> 24:38.176
Holly's right,
it would be a wicked idea.

24:38.243 --> 24:41.079
Definitely, million percent,
pimps and hos.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.849
I know. It should be good.

24:43.915 --> 24:46.785
Welcome to Geordie Shore, kid.
Let's fucking do it.

24:47.786 --> 24:49.654
Me and Aaron have got work tonight

24:49.721 --> 24:52.657
and what better place for pre-drinks
than the Jacuzzi.

24:52.724 --> 24:56.027
Thing is with Holly, right,
she fucking loves attention.

24:56.094 --> 24:58.930
She got plenty last night.
Kind of embarrassing.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.333
"Holly!" That's not
gonna happen tonight.

25:01.399 --> 25:03.935
Seeing as Holly's
playing hard to get,

25:04.002 --> 25:07.372
me and Scott are gonna have fun
and pull some birds. I can't wait.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.545
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:18.149 --> 25:19.584
Yeah, sound.

25:19.651 --> 25:23.221
Aaron needs to realise you're not
gonna come and steal the throne.

25:23.288 --> 25:25.924
There's only one seat
and that's for fucking me.

25:27.425 --> 25:31.363
This is going to work.
It's going to get Charlotte back.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.732
Boys, what the fuck are yous doing?

25:33.798 --> 25:37.936
If I had to pick between you
and Gary for a relationship, you.

25:38.003 --> 25:41.406
Marnie is a crafty little bastard,
telling me she still likes us

25:41.473 --> 25:45.176
and then going to bed with Gary.
This ain't looking good.

25:45.243 --> 25:47.846
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

25:50.015 --> 25:50.215
.

25:52.851 --> 25:53.051
.

26:01.693 --> 26:03.161
So, I'm leaving for work

26:03.228 --> 26:06.464
and I can't believe I've gotta go
with these two idiots.

26:09.968 --> 26:13.672
Tonight is my first night at work.
I just hope I do Anna proud.

26:22.614 --> 26:24.883
What better way
to get the party started

26:24.950 --> 26:28.119
than start playing
pass the ice cube?

26:28.186 --> 26:31.189
I'm necking on with birds
left, right and centre,

26:31.256 --> 26:34.592
girls necking on with girls,
and Holly doesn't look impressed.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.765
Only three birds on the bar crawl,

26:40.832 --> 26:43.768
but there's a fit blondie,
my name written all over her.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.572
Yeah!
(both laugh)

26:47.639 --> 26:49.774
My job is to take people
on a bar crawl,

26:49.841 --> 26:52.477
neck on with birds and get pissed.

27:01.519 --> 27:03.188
I'm buzzing that I'm not at work

27:03.254 --> 27:05.857
and me, Marnie and James
can just go out and party.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.092
Cheers, guys.

27:07.158 --> 27:10.495
It's time to get out, get mortal
and hit Florita's.

27:24.175 --> 27:26.978
I need to talk to Gary,
work out where his head's at,

27:27.045 --> 27:28.713
so I can work out where mine is.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.853
I thought me and Marnie
were just a bit of fun.

27:34.919 --> 27:37.155
Why are we even having
this conversation?

27:45.063 --> 27:49.167
All I want is sex with no strings
attached. Is that too much to ask?

28:01.413 --> 28:02.814
We moved on to the next bar

28:02.881 --> 28:05.650
and I'm shuffling on the dance floor
like a divvy.

28:12.924 --> 28:15.960
Boys, what the fuck are yous doing?

28:19.431 --> 28:21.132
Me and Aaron are pulling birds,

28:21.199 --> 28:23.835
but his bird
is after a slice of me as well.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.439
Work was absolutely class.

28:27.505 --> 28:30.775
Now it's onto the club to see
the rest of the crew. Key-mon.

28:32.710 --> 28:35.613
I get to Florita's
and I'm so pleased to see the others.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.350
I can't be with these two buffoons
by myself anymore.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.958
Last time,
me and Scott were on and off.

28:47.025 --> 28:50.128
We haven't spoke
and we need to clear the air.

28:53.331 --> 28:54.732
I'm trying to explain,

28:54.799 --> 28:58.269
I didn't put out because I thought
we could have went somewhere.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.348
I'm the one for the long run.

29:10.415 --> 29:14.552
She's gonna have to run fucking far
now, cos she's got no chance. Dafty.

29:16.254 --> 29:20.225
The birds me and Aaron were pulling
on the bar crawl just rocked up.

29:20.291 --> 29:23.695
If all goes well, I'm gonna be
bada-bada balls deep in the kid.

29:27.765 --> 29:29.801
Fucking hell,
they need to get a room.

29:32.770 --> 29:35.707
Me and Gary are speaking about
where we're gonna sleep.

29:35.773 --> 29:38.643
I've got good intentions
and I should sleep in my bed.

29:43.348 --> 29:45.116
(laughs)

29:47.852 --> 29:49.454
I'm going home with Marnie.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.958
I never thought this would happen
with me and Gary,

29:54.025 --> 29:56.561
but now that
Charlotte's practically engaged,

29:56.628 --> 29:58.396
who knows what can happen?

30:11.609 --> 30:14.445
I'm hungry as fuck.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.514
Aaron cleans for food.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.094
It didn't take Gary long
to get me in that shag pad.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.963
This ain't looking good.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.898
Marnie is a crafty little bastard.

30:33.965 --> 30:37.001
Telling me she still likes us
then going to bed with Gary.

30:37.068 --> 30:39.437
I just hope he doesn't get
his head messed up.

30:46.211 --> 30:49.147
Marnie must know by now,
when I say I'm gonna cuddle you,

30:49.214 --> 30:51.482
I might as well say
I'll bang you all over.

30:51.549 --> 30:54.152
Cuddling doesn't exist
on the waterbed.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.637
I've woke up in the shag pad again,

31:12.704 --> 31:15.240
only this time
things went further with Gary.

31:16.507 --> 31:18.676
I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

31:19.677 --> 31:21.646
So, how do you feel about Marnie?

31:26.384 --> 31:27.385
Would you?

31:28.720 --> 31:31.656
Aaron's asking me if I'm bothered
about Gaz and Marnie.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.524
Jog on, mate, the kid can crack on.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.128
(groans)

31:37.195 --> 31:40.298
I hate waking up in this room
without Charlotte.

31:40.365 --> 31:42.467
(laughs) Morning.
Morning.

31:42.533 --> 31:45.069
I go and see Holly
and she seems down and upset.

31:45.136 --> 31:49.240
It's just hard because, like,
me and Marnie are all right now,

31:49.307 --> 31:52.577
but it's still not the same
when I wake up every morning alone.

31:52.644 --> 31:56.147
I'm used to the girls being there,
and it's just fucking horrible.

32:06.157 --> 32:08.159
Gary's trying to quiz us
about Scott,

32:08.226 --> 32:11.529
but we both know the situation
with us, so why does he even care?

32:15.333 --> 32:18.202
(laughs) That's nice.
(laughs)

32:18.269 --> 32:20.104
Me and Marnie are both fair game.

32:20.171 --> 32:22.774
I can pull who I want,
she can pull who she wants.

32:29.514 --> 32:33.451
I'm really, really missing Charlotte.
I don't know when she'll come back.

32:33.518 --> 32:36.454
I need to throw some positive vibes
out to the universe.

32:36.521 --> 32:40.825
The law of attraction basically
means, if you think about something

32:40.892 --> 32:43.061
and believe you already
have something,

32:43.127 --> 32:45.163
it will accumulate, you will have it.

32:45.229 --> 32:50.168
We need to get something to attract
Charlotte back to the house.

32:50.234 --> 32:53.538
Holly's telling me,
if she thinks positive,

32:53.604 --> 32:56.874
then Charlotte will return.
Is she mental? I'm thinking a pet.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.016
This is going to work.
It's going to get Charlotte back.

33:07.885 --> 33:11.055
Hi, are you all right?
I'm fine, how's you?

33:11.122 --> 33:12.523
Good.
How you doing?

33:12.590 --> 33:16.094
We wanna get some more pets.
There's plenty for you to look at.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.930
There's so many animals here.
Hello, bunny.

33:18.996 --> 33:23.534
And I wanna take them all home.
All right, mate? What's going on?

33:23.601 --> 33:26.971
There's rabbits,
there's lizards, there's birds, fish.

33:27.038 --> 33:29.574
You wanna have a look at tortoises?
Oh, my God!

33:29.640 --> 33:31.309
We're gonna get tortoises!

33:31.376 --> 33:34.746
I mean, he's going a bit slow.
Cos it's a turtle, you divvy.

33:34.812 --> 33:38.616
Can we take its shell off? What?
You can't take his shell off. No.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.685
Holly's decided to get a tortoise,

33:40.752 --> 33:43.187
but where's it gonna swim,
the hot tub?

33:43.254 --> 33:45.323
I feel really, really good about this

33:45.390 --> 33:48.359
and I think it's definitely
gonna bring Charlotte back.

33:48.426 --> 33:49.460
We'll see.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.563
I hope that getting this pet,
even though it's shit,

33:52.630 --> 33:56.534
will bring Charlotte back, because
I can tell she really misses her.

34:01.005 --> 34:04.542
We can't wait to show everyone back
at the house our new family.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.077
Hiya.
Oh, fuck.

34:06.144 --> 34:07.812
Oh, my God.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.214
We got turtles... tortoises.
Fuck off.

34:11.649 --> 34:14.284
Why the fuck would anyone
want pet tortoises?

34:14.351 --> 34:16.821
It's not like you can
take it for a walk.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.824
They're fucking ugly, like.
Do they poo? Yeah.

34:20.891 --> 34:24.328
Holly reckons if she gets an animal,
it'll draw Charlotte back.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.697
No, I don't reckon, I know.

34:26.764 --> 34:30.333
I don't want Charlotte here.
Fuck off, tortoises.

34:35.106 --> 34:38.109
Tonight's the ultimate test
for Gaz and Marnie.

34:38.176 --> 34:42.447
It's a house party. If they don't
pull anyone, it must be serious.

34:56.092 --> 34:58.996
If the lads want me to prove
I'm not loved up with Marnie

34:59.063 --> 35:01.599
and I can go to bed by myself,
then I will.

35:01.666 --> 35:04.936
It's gonna be the best
Geordie Shore house party ever.

35:05.002 --> 35:08.606
She's got her tits in his face.
I'm getting a little bit jealous.

35:08.673 --> 35:11.375
Scott T's nicked my bird,
fucking greedy prick.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.211
I didn't say that.
Absolutely...

35:13.277 --> 35:17.081
I didn't say that!
This is going too deep already.

35:17.148 --> 35:19.684
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

35:21.919 --> 35:22.119
.

35:24.755 --> 35:24.956
.

35:37.935 --> 35:40.771
It's the house party tonight
and it's Gaz's birthday.

35:40.838 --> 35:43.508
The lads are dressed up as pimps,
apart from Scott,

35:43.574 --> 35:46.143
who's decided to get dressed up
as a Spice Girl.

35:47.211 --> 35:49.680
It's my birthday
and this is my party,

35:49.747 --> 35:52.583
I can't wait for this room
to fill up with fit birds.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.756
This is my first Geordie Shore
house party.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.392
They're legendary in Newcastle.
I can't wait.

36:02.426 --> 36:06.297
Loads of people are here, everyone's
dressed up, all me mates are here.

36:06.364 --> 36:07.598
Happy birthday, me.

36:09.133 --> 36:12.403
It's gonna be the best
Geordie Shore house party ever.

36:14.171 --> 36:16.040
Yeah.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.776
Buzzing that the little blondie's
just turned up.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.646
Looks like I'm in for a good night.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.781
So, I'm upstairs
talking to my friend

36:23.848 --> 36:26.918
and it feels such a relief to be
able to tell her about Gary.

36:26.984 --> 36:29.453
I couldn't help it.
It's like it had to happen.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.856
It didn't happen very long, though.

36:31.923 --> 36:37.094
Yeah. I think it's... maybe it's
the width of that and the length.

36:37.161 --> 36:39.964
It's so big,
it's like the Loch Ness Monster.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.666
It maybe could even be bigger.

36:46.170 --> 36:47.638
The party's in full swing

36:47.705 --> 36:50.708
and it's time to announce
Gary's birthday surprise

36:50.775 --> 36:52.877
and he's not gonna know
what's hit him.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.946
(cheering)

36:56.847 --> 37:00.318
Gaz's birthday surprise is here
and she's a fat old stripper.

37:00.384 --> 37:03.020
It looks like he's in
for a right treat.

37:03.087 --> 37:07.325
Yeah, well what I'm thinking is,
if she's giving me a lap dance, fuck.

37:07.391 --> 37:11.629
(party guests)
Four, five, six, seven. (cheering)

37:15.866 --> 37:20.338
Gary's looking on in horrification.
He's absolutely furious.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.807
She's got Gary
in all these positions.

37:22.873 --> 37:27.244
She's got her tits in his face,
she's groping him and to be honest,

37:27.311 --> 37:29.380
I'm getting a little bit jealous.

37:29.447 --> 37:32.817
That was horrific. I said I wanted
to pull someone else tonight.

37:32.883 --> 37:34.518
That is not what I had in mind.

37:35.519 --> 37:36.988
(screams)

37:40.224 --> 37:42.293
Yeah, I'll come back in two seconds.

37:51.669 --> 37:54.372
Aaron's completely ignored
this girl he pulled.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.407
I'm gonna have to sort her out
as well.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.360
Are you all right?
Yeah, you?

38:16.427 --> 38:18.329
Oh, you dropped your pimp stick.

38:18.396 --> 38:23.000
I'm checking the new boy is enjoying
his first Geordie Shore house party.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.535
I love it.
You love it?

38:24.602 --> 38:26.971
Everyone's sound,
everyone's dressed up,

38:30.775 --> 38:33.010
She's only turned up.
Oh, I know, I know.

38:33.077 --> 38:36.013
"Hello, darling, where you going?"
I know, she's nice.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.748
Yeah, she's like a nice girl.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.283
The fit blonde's here.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.886
If Holly's not interested,
she definitely is.

38:41.952 --> 38:44.622
So, you're over me now?

38:44.689 --> 38:47.491
Well... nearly.
Nearly? Nearly.

38:47.558 --> 38:50.928
Holly's asking if I'm over her.
Ice Queen is starting to melt.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.932
The thing is though, "nearly" means
two more drinks, probably not.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.600
Probably not?
Probably not.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.570
Aaron is actually a really nice lad
and who knows,

38:59.637 --> 39:03.007
if he plays his cards right,
he might get to spoon me tonight.

39:10.548 --> 39:13.551
So, Scotty T's nicked my bird.
Fucking greedy prick.

39:15.453 --> 39:18.456
It's not my fault the girls
choose Scotty T every time.

39:20.491 --> 39:24.328
Gary hasn't actually pulled
anyone except Marnie yet.

39:24.395 --> 39:25.963
What the fuck is going on?

39:35.973 --> 39:39.210
If he shags her again tonight,
that's basically love.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.048
I'm treating the birds
to a Scotty T sandwich.

39:44.115 --> 39:47.451
I hope they're carnivores.
I've got a pterodactyl in my kegs.

39:56.794 --> 39:59.130
Marnie's now sprawled across us.

39:59.196 --> 40:02.767
It's like a lion protecting her prey
against other lions.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.735
Why haven't you pulled?

40:06.170 --> 40:08.305
It's cos of me, don't lie.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.408
I've got standards, Gary.

40:11.475 --> 40:14.645
Surprise, surprise, Marnie says
there's no fit lads there.

40:14.712 --> 40:17.414
That's Marnie saying,
"I wanna be with you."

40:19.650 --> 40:21.385
Really?

40:21.452 --> 40:24.855
Gary's telling us that he
couldn't find anyone fitter than me,

40:24.922 --> 40:26.991
it's obviously gonna
make us feel good.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.696
First Geordie Shore house party,

40:32.763 --> 40:36.167
absolutely unreal, best night
I've had in the house so far. Mint.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.605
Aaron tried for ages
to get me into bed,

40:41.672 --> 40:44.608
and he finally gets in my bed,
and doesn't try anything.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.179
Maybe he's just a gentleman.

40:48.245 --> 40:52.283
Gaz is one of me best mates, so
I'm gonna tell him what Marnie said.

40:52.349 --> 40:55.486
She can't bang him one minute,
then say that to me the next.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.068
Scott, if she liked you,

41:11.135 --> 41:13.904
she would have shagged you last time
after six weeks.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.312
Mate, I know.

41:24.014 --> 41:27.051
Well, then you need
to ask her this, though.

41:27.117 --> 41:28.786
He doesn't seem to get the point

41:28.853 --> 41:31.555
that Marnie didn't shag me
because she likes us.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.893
Don't let this
come between you and me.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.028
Gaz needs to realise
I've got his back

41:38.095 --> 41:41.866
and I don't want Marnie
to come between me and him again.

41:43.567 --> 41:46.203
So, Gary's just said
we need to talk immediately.

41:55.312 --> 41:56.614
I'm gutted at the fact

41:56.680 --> 42:00.451
that Marnie's actually gone out
of her way to tell Scott this. Why?

42:00.517 --> 42:04.321
Scott falls in love
and you don't do that, not you.

42:06.290 --> 42:07.691
Am I wrong?

42:08.959 --> 42:10.861
Gary looks proper devastated.

42:10.928 --> 42:13.764
I thought there was no strings,
so why does he care?

42:13.831 --> 42:16.467
You never like any girl.
I've seen...

42:19.470 --> 42:22.339
Look at the way like
you treat Charlotte.

42:22.406 --> 42:24.541
Oh... (sighs) Wow.

42:24.608 --> 42:28.178
Marnie has now dropped the C bomb.
She's brought Charlotte into it.

42:28.245 --> 42:32.249
Me and Marnie are totally different
to what me and Charlotte had.

42:32.316 --> 42:36.553
It was a total different situation.
How like?

42:47.331 --> 42:49.600
I didn't. I did not.

42:51.969 --> 42:54.438
I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.

42:54.505 --> 42:55.572
I didn't say that!

42:55.639 --> 42:59.176
There was no point in
this conversation with me and Gary.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.778
It was a total waste of time.

43:00.844 --> 43:03.580
Even if I did say that to Scott,
he shouldn't care.

43:03.647 --> 43:06.517
This would be different
if you were different.

43:06.583 --> 43:08.986
It would, but you're not.
You're Gary.

43:09.053 --> 43:13.357
Me and Marnie were meant to be a bit
of fun. This is too deep already.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.899
I'm back and I can't wait to see
that bunch of helmets.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.401
Have you missed me?
(screaming)

43:24.468 --> 43:26.737
Oh my, God, it's Vicky.

43:26.804 --> 43:30.240
If he did go against that lad code,
I would fall out with him.

43:30.307 --> 43:33.410
Gary just needs to get over himself
and stop being jealous.

43:33.477 --> 43:37.081
We're double-teaming Gary and he's
screaming like a fucking baby.

43:37.147 --> 43:38.749
Oh, my God, no, no, no.

43:38.816 --> 43:42.019
Next thing I know, tops are off
and we're fucking face to face.

43:42.086 --> 43:43.988
I knew shit like this would happen.

44:08.946 --> 44:09.146
.
