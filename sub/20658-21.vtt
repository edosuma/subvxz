WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:08.342
I miss you, baby.
The kids miss you.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.245
The judge told us that
you ain't ever getting out.

00:11.279 --> 00:14.014
I can't believe Adam
got you thrown in prison.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.083
Are you okay?

00:15.116 --> 00:16.750
It'll be fine.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.219
I've seen "Orange
Is the New Black."

00:18.252 --> 00:19.687
I'll make friends
of varying

00:19.720 --> 00:22.090
ethnic backgrounds
and grow as a person.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.425
Very slowly.
Time's up.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.726
Wait, am I Jason Biggs?

00:25.759 --> 00:27.128
Gotta go, bye,
I love you.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.199
But no one likes
Jason Biggs!

00:31.232 --> 00:34.135
(overlapping shouts,
laughter)

00:37.238 --> 00:39.873
Quiet!
(shouting, laughter stops)

00:39.907 --> 00:42.643
You gonna learn today!

00:51.252 --> 00:52.886
Hi, my name's Emily.
I've never been

00:52.920 --> 00:54.222
to prison before.
I'm awaiting trial

00:54.255 --> 00:55.889
on a small,
trumped up drug charge,

00:55.923 --> 00:57.225
and I'm trying
not to be scared

00:57.258 --> 01:00.394
by keeping an open mind
and checking my privilege.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.929
What's your name?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.063
Wow.

01:03.097 --> 01:06.066
I can already tell
that this is gonna be long.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.201
I'm Kendra.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.802
I'm awaiting trial
for drugs, too.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.738
And I got priors.

01:10.771 --> 01:11.905
What priors?

01:11.939 --> 01:13.907
More drugs.

01:13.941 --> 01:16.043
Oh, boy, you're nice.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.879
See, I knew prison
wouldn't be that bad.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.448
(neck squeaks)
You know, it probably serves

01:20.481 --> 01:21.915
a pretty important
purpose.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.251
It deters crime,

01:23.284 --> 01:25.419
it punishes people
appropriately,

01:25.453 --> 01:29.089
and it gives us a chance
to rehabilitate ourselves.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.225
Wait, I'm talking
too much.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.261
Tell me your rich
emotional backstory.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.795
How about I tell you
that everything

01:34.828 --> 01:37.398
that you just said
is complete bull(bleep).

01:37.431 --> 01:39.167
You know nothing
about this place.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.934
She's right, Emily!

01:40.968 --> 01:42.403
Oh, no!
He followed me here.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.905
Time to "Shawshank"
my way out.

01:44.938 --> 01:45.939
Who are you?

01:45.973 --> 01:47.675
Hi, I'm Adam Conover.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.977
And this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:50.010 --> 01:51.779
Told ya
you gonna learn.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.947
(whistling)

01:53.981 --> 01:56.484
♪♪

01:56.517 --> 01:58.486
(beeping, buzzing)

02:02.156 --> 02:04.792
Adam, you got me
into this,

02:04.825 --> 02:06.160
now you get me out!

02:06.194 --> 02:08.462
I promise, I have someone
working on it.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.364
But in the meantime,
this is a great opportunity

02:10.398 --> 02:12.300
to explain why our
nation's prison system

02:12.333 --> 02:14.502
is a failure
on every level.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.804
Ha! So you know
a lot about prison?

02:16.837 --> 02:19.207
I bet you watch a lot
of PBS documentaries, huh?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.308
I guess you're right.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.142
I do lack
firsthand knowledge.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.845
Ooh, maybe you could
help me do this episode?

02:24.878 --> 02:26.680
Sure.
Nothing better to do.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.516
(snaps fingers)

02:28.549 --> 02:29.517
Whoa!

02:29.550 --> 02:31.319
Do you have magic
TV powers like Adam?

02:31.352 --> 02:34.788
Nope, but I got
a lot of favors.

02:34.822 --> 02:35.789
(both)
Hmm.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.991
Early lunch today.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.960
Early lunch today,
everyone.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.062
America's prison system
is a total mess.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.665
Whatever purpose you think
it serves, it ain't doing it.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.900
Well, the point of prison
is to reduce crime.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.002
It's definitely not
doing that.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.170
There are
2.2 million people

02:50.204 --> 02:51.372
incarcerated in the U.S.,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.674
ten times more
than 50 years ago.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.877
Two million is more than
the population of some states.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.647
Welcome to Mass-Incarceration-
Achusetts.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.849
Our primary export-- shivs.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.685
Our secondary export-- cod!

03:04.718 --> 03:07.755
Hey!
That's cod-traband.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.057
(laughing)

03:10.090 --> 03:11.525
But despite
this massive increase

03:11.559 --> 03:12.826
in the prison population,

03:12.860 --> 03:15.028
a study conducted
by the NYU School of Law

03:15.062 --> 03:16.930
found that the effect
on the crime rate

03:16.964 --> 03:19.099
has been essentially zero.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.869
Zero? Then why do we lock
so many people up?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.537
Well, I can't speak
for all prisons,

03:23.571 --> 03:25.439
but this one
is here to make money.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.040
Make money?

03:27.074 --> 03:29.176
You mean someone is
profiting from all this?

03:29.209 --> 03:32.846
Yep, these guys are.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.383
It all started
in the "tough on crime" '80s,

03:35.416 --> 03:36.884
when the war on drugs
meant state

03:36.917 --> 03:38.952
and federal prisons were
bursting at the seams.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.021
So many prisoners?
What do we do?

03:41.054 --> 03:43.056
Let corporate America
handle your prisons.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.358
We'll take care
of everything.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.426
Save you a few bucks

03:45.459 --> 03:46.894
and skim a little
off the top.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.529
Businesses
running prisons?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.130
That sounds
a little fishy.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.733
(laughing)
Just kidding!

03:52.766 --> 03:55.803
I mean, hey, if it
saves money, right?

03:55.836 --> 03:58.439
(Adam)
And so the Corrections
Corporation of America,

03:58.472 --> 04:00.308
or CCA, was born.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.076
Okay, hold on.
You can't just sell prisons

04:03.110 --> 04:05.946
like they're cars or real estate
or hamburgers.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.449
Hmph! Then why don't you
tell that to Tom Beasley.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.851
the co-founder of CCA
who once said...

04:15.456 --> 04:16.724
(man on PA)
CCA, can I take your order?

04:16.757 --> 04:20.628
I'll have a number seven
with extra solitary cells,

04:20.661 --> 04:22.963
electric fence,
and small onion rings.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.932
Like to supermax that?
Yeah, I'll supermax it.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.800
And they rake in
a ton of scratch.

04:26.834 --> 04:30.471
Last year, CCA
took in $1.7 billion.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.806
Business is so good
it's criminal.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.775
(laughter)

04:34.808 --> 04:35.976
Well, you know,
maybe it's okay

04:36.009 --> 04:37.845
because they're saving
the taxpayer money.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.280
Sorry! The sales pitch
was wrong.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.949
The data shows
that private prisons

04:41.982 --> 04:44.117
cost the taxpayers
just as much

04:44.151 --> 04:45.419
as regular prisons.

04:45.453 --> 04:48.356
And today, nearly one-fifth
of federal prisoners

04:48.389 --> 04:50.123
are held
in a for-profit facility.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.291
Okay, no--

04:51.325 --> 04:55.128
Ah, graffiti!
That's an infraction.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.698
A beautiful one.
Are you Banksy?

04:57.731 --> 05:01.034
Oh, my gosh, I already
got an infraction.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.503
They must give out
a lot of these.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.405
Oh, yeah, that's not
a coincidence.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.208
One study showed
that private prisons

05:08.241 --> 05:09.777
dole out twice as many
infractions

05:09.810 --> 05:10.978
as government prisons.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.381
Not having enough
infractions.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.649
That's an infraction.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.451
These penalties
can lengthen your sentence,

05:17.485 --> 05:19.286
which earns the company
even more cash.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.688
Oh, so the more people
that are in prison,

05:20.721 --> 05:22.155
the more money
they make.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.824
Ooh, that's dirty!

05:23.857 --> 05:25.526
Yep, that's why
private prisons

05:25.559 --> 05:28.028
sneak occupancy clauses
into their contracts,

05:28.061 --> 05:31.198
which actually require states
to keep prisons full.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.634
Last year, a private prison
in Arizona

05:33.667 --> 05:36.169
didn't make
their 97% capacity quota,

05:36.203 --> 05:37.905
so the state government
had to pay them

05:37.938 --> 05:39.473
a $3 million fine.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.742
Fines like that incentivize
cash-strapped states

05:41.775 --> 05:44.678
to keep people in prison
as long as possible.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.547
Your parole forms
are in order

05:46.580 --> 05:48.682
and you've been
a model prisoner,

05:48.716 --> 05:50.518
so we're going to--
(clears throat)

05:50.551 --> 05:52.252
Lock you back up.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.422
We really can't afford
to pay another fine.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.925
That's reprehensible.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.193
Look, not all prisons
are private prisons,

06:00.227 --> 06:01.595
but this one is,
so no,

06:01.629 --> 06:03.397
it's purpose
isn't to stop crime.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.433
It's the dollar-dollar
bills, y'all!

06:05.466 --> 06:07.367
(chuckling)
Whoo!

06:07.401 --> 06:09.002
I can't believe all this
has been happening

06:09.036 --> 06:10.671
and I didn't even know.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.373
I mean, I never thought
about prison, like, at all.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.875
Hey, pulling back the curtain

06:14.908 --> 06:16.777
on our disturbing
business practices,

06:16.810 --> 06:18.779
that's an infraction.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.581
Hey, that makes
three infractions.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.382
You're gonna go
to solitary.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.051
Okay, that doesn't
sound so bad.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.353
You know, peace and quiet,
do some meditating.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.455
No, solitary confinement

06:27.488 --> 06:28.956
is a cruel and
inhumane punishment

06:28.989 --> 06:31.391
that has no place
in modern society.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.726
Wait, what?

06:32.760 --> 06:33.727
Eh, we'll tell you
about it

06:33.761 --> 06:34.895
after you get settled
in the hole.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.564
No, tell me now!

06:40.434 --> 06:42.269
(door buzzes)

06:45.272 --> 06:47.107
Solitary confinement.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.943
Okay, we're here,
we're doing this.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.044
Hmm.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.746
Yeah, maybe it won't
be so bad.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.816
I can read and think
and get super jacked

06:55.849 --> 06:57.417
by punching the wall
like in "Old Boy."

06:57.451 --> 06:58.586
Yeah, okay.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.455
Why-did-they-remake-
that-movie?!

07:01.489 --> 07:02.890
(Adam's voice)
Solitary confinement

07:02.923 --> 07:06.293
has devastating effects
on prisoners' mental health.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.661
(Kendra's voice)
In solitary, you're kept alone

07:07.695 --> 07:09.429
for 23 hours a day

07:09.463 --> 07:11.264
in a room the size
of a king-size bed.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.266
Well, that doesn't sound
so bad.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.802
Me and Murph share
a queen.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.471
Wait, where are those voices
coming from?

07:19.306 --> 07:22.009
Oh, no, oh, gosh.
I'm seeing things.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.745
It's an archaic and cruel
form of punishment

07:24.778 --> 07:27.114
that started in the 1800s.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.349
Eh, something to watch,
I guess.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.952
Solitary confinement
was conceived by Quakers,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.487
who thought prisoners
would use the time

07:33.521 --> 07:35.823
to reflect
and study the Bible.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.759
You know, I've been meaning
to read this.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.029
But even they decided
it was too cruel to use.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.598
The Supreme Court
at the time declared...

07:44.632 --> 07:47.134
"Prisoners subject
to solitary confinement

07:47.167 --> 07:52.139
became violently insane;
others committed suicide."

07:52.172 --> 07:54.007
Ugh. We gotta stop
doing this.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.143
Stop, stop!
(Adam)
We did stop.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.111
Solitary confinement
fell out of use

07:58.145 --> 07:59.980
in the U.S.
for a century,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.215
but a few decades ago,
we brought it back,

08:02.249 --> 08:05.318
and it's been destroying
minds ever since.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.654
Destroying minds?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.522
I mean, that sounds
a little hyperbolic.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.457
Yeah, maybe.
What do I know?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.925
I'm just a hallucination.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.663
Hello?

08:15.696 --> 08:18.031
Adam?

08:19.099 --> 08:20.333
Is anyone here?

08:20.367 --> 08:22.035
(Adam's voice)
Humans are social animals,

08:22.069 --> 08:24.237
and a prolonged lack
of social contact

08:24.271 --> 08:28.175
can cause serious
and permanent brain damage.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.510
People held in solitary
hallucinate,

08:30.544 --> 08:31.745
fall into depression,

08:31.779 --> 08:33.480
and lose the ability
to keep track

08:33.513 --> 08:35.849
of how much time
has passed.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.417
How long
have I been in here?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.388
Oh, I'm really
losing it.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.357
Psst! Emily,
you okay in there?

08:44.391 --> 08:47.227
Kendra!
Oh, thank God!

08:47.260 --> 08:48.696
Why am I even here?

08:48.729 --> 08:51.164
I thought solitary was
for the worst of the worst.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.866
Nope,
solitary confinement

08:52.900 --> 08:54.868
is routinely used
in our prison system.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.103
It's basically given
to anyone

08:56.136 --> 08:58.538
the guards don't want
to deal with.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.373
The mentally ill.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.875
LGBT.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.177
I wouldn't
eat dinner.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.947
(all)
We had it coming!

09:06.980 --> 09:08.348
Man, if I'm gonna
hallucinate

09:08.381 --> 09:09.750
a Tony award-winning musical,

09:09.783 --> 09:11.251
why couldn't it be
"Hamilton"?

09:11.284 --> 09:12.552
Solitary confinement
is given

09:12.586 --> 09:16.256
to between 80,000
to 100,000 people a year.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.925
There are actually
entire prisons

09:17.958 --> 09:20.360
made up of nothing
but solitary cells.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.730
They're called
supermax prisons.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.231
Enormous complexes

09:24.264 --> 09:28.535
full of people held
in tiny cages like animals,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.404
slowly being driven insane.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.773
(Kendra)
They may be criminals,

09:32.806 --> 09:34.574
but they don't
deserve this.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.243
And it gets worse.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.578
Research shows
that solitary causes

09:38.612 --> 09:40.981
a syndrome called
delirium.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.383
People with delirium
don't just hallucinate.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.085
They have difficulty
thinking,

09:45.118 --> 09:46.486
they have
panic attacks,

09:46.519 --> 09:49.623
and they suffer
from overt paranoia.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.324
And once they're released
from solitary,

09:51.358 --> 09:54.094
the outside world
can be too much for them.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.329
There was a teenager
at Rikers

09:56.363 --> 09:57.597
named Kalief Browder.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.499
He was accused
of stealing a backpack.

09:59.532 --> 10:03.103
We was held in solitary
for almost two years,

10:03.136 --> 10:04.838
and then his case
was thrown out.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.439
He never even went
to trial

10:06.473 --> 10:08.776
and still had to suffer
through solitary.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.911
And when he got out,
his family said

10:10.944 --> 10:13.180
that would hole up
in his room for days.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.315
He committed suicide.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.786
Oh, my God.
That poor kid.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.789
Some prisoners are kept
in solitary for decades.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.123
Decades.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.826
And then one day,
shoved back into society,

10:25.859 --> 10:28.595
often in worse mental shape
than when they arrived.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.530
Put all that together,
and it's hard

10:30.563 --> 10:33.033
to escape the conclusion
that solitary confinement

10:33.066 --> 10:35.202
should be considered
a form of torture.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.638
You're right.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.309
You're right.
I need to get out of here.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.177
How do I get out
of here...

10:44.211 --> 10:47.514
All right, time's up.
(door buzzes)

10:47.547 --> 10:48.816
My favorite part

10:48.849 --> 10:51.484
is how Caro exposes
that Johnson's power

10:51.518 --> 10:53.320
comes from
his deep insecurities.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.188
Ooh, we should
start a book club.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.326
Hey, how was solitary?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.962
I learned it's an unbearably
cruel form of punishment

11:01.995 --> 11:05.532
that needs to be abolished.
You taught me that.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.535
You're right, but we've been
here the whole time.

11:08.568 --> 11:11.371
You guys weren't actually
in there with me?

11:11.404 --> 11:12.873
Nope! In fact,
I've been here

11:12.906 --> 11:14.341
getting a cool
prison tattoo.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.342
See?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.844
Well, I am not
going back!

11:16.877 --> 11:17.845
(snaps fingers)

11:17.878 --> 11:19.579
From now on,
best behavior.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.680
I'll use prison

11:20.714 --> 11:23.016
as an opportunity
to rehabilitate myself.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.352
Yeah, I'll study,
and I'll take classes,

11:25.385 --> 11:28.989
and I'll get "swole"
as hell... up here.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.524
Well, that's not gonna
be easy

11:31.558 --> 11:34.294
since rehabilitation is now
borderline impossible.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.731
(Emily)
Aah!

11:37.765 --> 11:39.232
You owe me a new copy.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.769
Of course.
(whistling)

11:45.272 --> 11:46.239
♪♪

11:46.273 --> 11:47.775
Okay, prison stinks.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.077
But that's just if you don't
have the right attitude.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.012
I'm gonna be
a model prisoner,

11:52.045 --> 11:55.282
work hard, and come out
ready to reenter society.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.084
Rehabilitating folks
should be

11:57.117 --> 11:58.718
the goal
of our prison system.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.221
Too bad it actively
does the opposite.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.690
How do you plan to better
yourself in here?

12:03.723 --> 12:07.027
Through education!
I've seen movies.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.396
I'm gonna get my law degree
while studying the classics

12:09.429 --> 12:12.132
like Plato
and "Ari-strudel."

12:12.165 --> 12:13.967
Okay, what books
we got?

12:14.001 --> 12:18.071
"Larry Podder
and the Gang Initiation"?

12:18.105 --> 12:21.775
"How to Shiv Friends
and Influence Cellmates"?

12:21.809 --> 12:24.277
Okay, where are all
the real books?

12:24.311 --> 12:25.946
I feel like I'm being
set up to fail.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.380
That's because
you are.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.250
It's been years since
your prison education fantasy

12:30.283 --> 12:33.253
was a reality.
Back in 1847,

12:33.286 --> 12:34.988
Sing Sing's prison
education program

12:35.022 --> 12:37.224
had a curriculum
that included reading,

12:37.257 --> 12:40.493
writing, math,
history, geography,

12:40.527 --> 12:42.930
physiology, and even
phys ed.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.834
Well, great!
Sign me up.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.168
That was
a long time ago.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.469
Government budget cuts

12:49.502 --> 12:52.005
have systematically eliminated
any opportunity for people

12:52.039 --> 12:54.474
to educate themselves
while in prison.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.410
In 1994, tough on crime
was all the rage,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.847
and American politicians
hated the idea

12:59.880 --> 13:02.182
that prisoners
should get anything.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.351
Bad guys getting
Pell Grants?

13:04.384 --> 13:08.088
No! They should be getting
Hell... Ants!

13:08.121 --> 13:10.490
Or something.
I hate them!

13:10.523 --> 13:14.161
(cheers and applause)

13:14.194 --> 13:15.662
Since then
we've gone from having

13:15.695 --> 13:17.797
350 college degree
programs

13:17.831 --> 13:20.567
for prisoners across the country
to just 12.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.204
(crickets chirping)

13:24.237 --> 13:26.940
And good luck getting into
the programs that do exist.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.642
The largest prison training
program in the country

13:29.676 --> 13:31.811
has a waiting list
of 10,000 people.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.614
Um, excuse me, how long
have you been waiting here?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.716
(spooky music cue)
Aah!

13:36.749 --> 13:39.119
And this is a real shame
because studies show

13:39.152 --> 13:41.454
that education is
the easiest,

13:41.488 --> 13:43.623
cheapest way
to reduce recidivism.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.126
Right now,
40% of federal prisoners

13:46.159 --> 13:48.561
are back behind bars
within just three years.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.663
And instead of trying
to reduce that number,

13:50.697 --> 13:52.866
this system does everything
in its power to make sure

13:52.900 --> 13:54.634
that we end up back
in here again.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.069
Just ask
Daryl Atkinson.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.837
He's a lawyer
and Second Chance Fellow

13:57.871 --> 13:59.672
at the Justice Department.
(snaps fingers)

13:59.706 --> 14:01.975
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

14:02.009 --> 14:03.510
Oh, man, Adam!

14:03.543 --> 14:05.578
I was in the middle
of closing arguments.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.579
Sorry, Daryl.
You're just so good

14:06.613 --> 14:07.747
at explaining
these things.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.083
It's kind of what I do.
Hey, Emily.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.084
Hi!

14:11.118 --> 14:13.253
In 1996, I was convicted
of a first-time,

14:13.286 --> 14:15.088
non-violent drug crime
and sentenced

14:15.122 --> 14:16.723
to ten years
in prison.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.759
I did my time, got out,
got my education,

14:19.792 --> 14:22.162
my law degree,
and now here I am.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.831
You accomplished all that
after you were in the pokey?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.766
You ever call it
"the pokey"?

14:26.799 --> 14:29.102
Yeah, I did,
but it wasn't easy.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.905
People who leave prison
face a litany of barriers.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.706
Their rights
are stripped away

14:33.740 --> 14:36.776
and it impacts every aspect
of their daily lives.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.346
They have no money,
but they have to pay

14:39.379 --> 14:41.214
for their own
ankle monitors

14:41.248 --> 14:44.117
and other fees associated
with their incarceration.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.552
When they apply
for a job,

14:45.585 --> 14:47.054
they have to
check that box...

14:48.956 --> 14:51.091
...which immediately
disqualifies them

14:51.124 --> 14:52.792
from even being
considered.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.427
But finding a job
is often

14:54.461 --> 14:56.429
a requirement
of their parole.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.131
They can't find
a place to live

14:58.165 --> 15:01.401
because they're discriminated
against by landlords.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.636
They have no support
for themselves

15:03.670 --> 15:05.405
or support
from society.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.974
So, it's no wonder
that people

15:07.007 --> 15:08.475
keep coming back
to prison.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.810
Instead of truly
rehabilitating people,

15:10.843 --> 15:12.812
the system keeps
setting them up to fail.

15:12.845 --> 15:16.049
America is supposed to be
the land of second chances,

15:16.083 --> 15:17.484
but we continue to punish

15:17.517 --> 15:19.586
millions of American
citizens

15:19.619 --> 15:21.088
again and again
for things

15:21.121 --> 15:23.656
that they paid their debt
to society for.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.725
It's just wrong.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.793
Hey!

15:26.826 --> 15:28.561
Are you teaching people
stuff in here?

15:28.595 --> 15:31.264
That's not allowed!

15:31.298 --> 15:32.465
They're supposed to
be sitting down

15:32.499 --> 15:34.501
and doing nothing
productive whatsoever.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.636
You two are coming
with me. Get up!

15:36.669 --> 15:37.937
(Adam)
Sorry, Daryl.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.506
Your trial can wait,
right?

15:39.539 --> 15:40.807
Ugh, and you're a man.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.209
I'm really not
on the ball today.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.280
You want to know
my emotional backstory?

15:47.314 --> 15:49.416
Here it is.
You're a teacher.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.184
My schooling sucked.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.420
I was in and out
of juvie as a kid.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.089
When I grew up,
juvie became prison.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.459
When I got out, I tried
my best to do right.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.961
But I had no money
and no one would hire me.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.432
So, I started
selling drugs again.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.966
I'm so sorry.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.369
Yeah, well,
it's not just me.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.205
60% of the prison population
are people of color.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.141
Black men are six times
more likely

16:14.174 --> 16:15.608
to be in prison
than white men.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.111
Whole communities
are stuck in this cycle.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.181
Two million Americans
are in prison.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.216
Two million of us
are trapped in a system

16:23.250 --> 16:25.885
that profits off of us
being in here,

16:25.918 --> 16:29.222
shove us in tiny boxes
where we go insane,

16:29.256 --> 16:30.490
and does everything
it can to make sure

16:30.523 --> 16:32.992
that we come back here.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.861
So, you tell me...

16:34.894 --> 16:36.496
what's the point
of prison?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.832
It honestly just seems like
it's to get the people

16:39.866 --> 16:41.568
that we're scared of
as far away from us

16:41.601 --> 16:44.337
as possible and then
forget about them.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.440
Bingo.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.078
I don't know
what to do.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.046
I feel so helpless.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.416
Welcome to the club.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.018
But there is some light
at the end of the tunnel.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.753
But I'll tell you about
that after the break.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.256

There are incremental steps

that we can take
to make the system better.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.900
Hey, Emily, several decades
after I got out of prison,

17:47.934 --> 17:50.603
I helped initiate a campaign
called "Ban the Box."

17:50.637 --> 17:52.071
The box
is that question

17:52.105 --> 17:53.606
on the applications,

17:53.640 --> 17:55.442
"Have you ever been
convicted of a felony?"

17:55.475 --> 17:57.977
And that box
on this application,

17:58.010 --> 17:59.712
it puts formerly
incarcerated people

17:59.746 --> 18:01.581
in a no-win situation.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.049
Either they have to lie

18:03.082 --> 18:05.552
and say they've never
been convicted of a crime,

18:05.585 --> 18:08.221
or they check that box
and face discrimination

18:08.255 --> 18:10.923
and never get call backs
for interviews or jobs.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.393
We're not asking companies
to hire people

18:13.426 --> 18:14.894
just because
they've been to prison.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.596
We ask them for
our fair chance

18:16.629 --> 18:17.897
to return
to the community

18:17.930 --> 18:20.900
and actually be a asset,
instead of a liability.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.602
(Daryl)
This is a campaign that helps

18:22.635 --> 18:25.738
our entire community
by reducing recidivism

18:25.772 --> 18:27.640
and keeping
our neighborhoods safe,

18:27.674 --> 18:30.243
something that everyone should
be onboard with.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.411
Thanks, guys.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.913
I'm totally onboard.
How can I help?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.081
Well, when you get
out of here,

18:35.114 --> 18:36.583
you can search online
for Ban the Box.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.185
I mean,
it's a start.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.919
But if we really want
to overhaul the system,

18:39.952 --> 18:42.289
we need to eliminate
mandatory minimums

18:42.322 --> 18:44.023
and all of those harsh laws

18:44.056 --> 18:46.159
that turn people
into second-class citizens.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.127
And we need
to ban solitary.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.596
Oh, yeah,
that's a given.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.200
Emily, we need your voice,
we need your energy.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.267
Use your privilege

18:54.301 --> 18:55.702
for something
that's meaningful.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.671
Of course! I am gonna fight
for all of this.

18:58.705 --> 18:59.772
When I get out of here--

18:59.806 --> 19:01.874
Oh! I forgot,
you're free to go.

19:01.908 --> 19:02.942
I'm sorry,
the judge gave me

19:02.975 --> 19:04.043
the note 30 minutes ago.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.345
I'm just so caught up
in this episode.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.814
I hope Robb Stark
has a fun wedding!

19:08.881 --> 19:10.116
Emily, that's great.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.484
I'm glad you get
to go home.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.619
But we gotta
take off.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.886
We got some other folks
to go visit

19:13.920 --> 19:14.987
and tell about
the movement.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.689
Congratulations.
Thank you.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.157
Yeah, I hope to see you
out there, homegirl.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.026
You will.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.494
(sighing)

19:24.831 --> 19:26.366
Well, Kendra...

19:29.001 --> 19:32.839
I'll write, you know,
or, I mean-- I won't forget.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.208
Um...

19:35.242 --> 19:37.143
I'll do what I can--
It's fine.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.378
I'm happy for you.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.879
Just go.

got me out?

working on it.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.661
Hey, who's this "we"?
Oh, sorry.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.162
Emily, this is
my sister, Rhea.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.330
She's a lawyer.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.165
A really good one,
apparently.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.833
Yeah, I just showed
the judge

20:00.867 --> 20:02.435
this episode
of Adam's show

20:02.469 --> 20:03.570
and he threw the case
right out.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.037
And she gave really
constructive criticism

20:05.071 --> 20:06.573
on act three.
We should have spent

20:06.606 --> 20:07.740
more time on fentanyl.

20:07.774 --> 20:08.841
(Emily gasps)
Murph!

20:08.875 --> 20:10.610

20:10.643 --> 20:11.844
Mwah!

20:11.878 --> 20:13.580
I missed you so much!
I missed you too!

20:13.613 --> 20:15.415
I'm so glad everything
worked out

20:15.448 --> 20:17.284
and that I don't have to
be Jason Biggs anymore,

20:17.317 --> 20:18.751
because I really didn't want
to get written off.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.887
Yeah.
Uh-- oh, Rhea.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.257
Thank you so much
for everything.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.692
Um, but, there's someone
in there

20:25.725 --> 20:27.927
who could really use
your legal help.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.028
Her name is Kendra Perkins

20:29.061 --> 20:30.563
and she's
in cell block 4B.

we have a pretty good case.

Not for you.

Lyndon B. Johnson surrounded
himself with father figures.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.724
How much of that
do you think

20:57.757 --> 20:59.292
is because of
his daddy issues?

20:59.326 --> 21:00.893
Oh, well, he was
obviously obsessed

21:00.927 --> 21:03.095
