-Would you like a tissue
Amanda-Susan?

00:12.166 --> 00:14.166
-[Coughs]: I'm good.

00:15.375 --> 00:18.208
[Coughs]
-Okay, why would you come to
school sick?

00:18.250 --> 00:20.166
Now you're going to get the
rest of us sick.

00:20.208 --> 00:23.208
-Someone got me sick, so I'm
paying it forward.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.166
Circle of life.
[Coughs]

00:25.208 --> 00:27.458
Circle of life? That's not the
circle of life

00:27.500 --> 00:29.667
Circle of life's when a
dolphin eats a giraffe.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.875
[Gerry]: What are you talking
about?
-[School bell rings]

00:31.917 --> 00:34.041
-Okay, let's go. Hand in your
assignments, right here.

00:34.083 --> 00:37.417
There's a spot right here. Right
here, right here everybody
right here.

00:37.458 --> 00:40.375
Okay, nice pile. Nice!
-[Amanda-Susan coughs]

00:40.417 --> 00:43.375
-That's not...That's not
the spot. That's not a pile.

00:43.417 --> 00:46.083
You're just doin' this on
purpose.

00:46.125 --> 00:48.291
Thank you.
No, no, no.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.458
No, no, no.
-What?

00:50.500 --> 00:53.208
-I'm not touching that with your
snot all over it. Get out of
here.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.458
-How are you going to grade me?
-B minus. Done.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.125
B plus.
-No B plus. Get outta here.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.291
Now it's a C.
Get out of my face.

01:01.333 --> 01:03.583
[Gerry]: Where's my...?
-Ahh choo!

01:03.625 --> 01:08.375
-Honestly? You can't cover your
mouth when you sneeze
Amanda-Susan?

01:08.417 --> 01:11.959
-That's disgusting.
Now, get out of my face.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.625
-I wouldn't drink that
if I were you.

01:15.667 --> 01:20.250
-Why wouldn't you drink it?
It's water. It's good for you.

01:20.291 --> 01:23.542
God, it's all over.

-Okay.

01:43.291 --> 01:46.834
And gentlemen? Helloooo.
Hi, hi Coach.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.792
[Gerry]: Please. Hi.

01:48.834 --> 01:51.250
-But I was looking at this side
of the room first.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.250
-Head on a swivel.
We have ladies here.

01:53.291 --> 01:55.458
-[Dave]: Okay, okay.
-Okay? Same thing I teach them.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.709
Head on a swivel.
It's alright.

First game. First game's the
biggest game of the year for us.

02:00.083 --> 02:03.125
Why? 'Cause it sets the tone.
And we play this team back to
back nights.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.750
We're gonna win tonight, and
we're gonna win tomorrow.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.959
-And then let's win for the

02:08.000 --> 02:10.166
-Please stop interrupting.
Thank you.
-Sorry.

02:10.208 --> 02:12.333
-Now, I'm gonna need a hero.

02:12.375 --> 02:14.583
I'm holding out for a hero for
the rest of the night.

02:14.625 --> 02:17.125
And he's gotta be strong.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.875
-And he's gotta be fast.
-Shhhhhh!

02:21.166 --> 02:23.458
-But, he does have to be fast.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.917
And he's gotta be fresh
from the fight.

02:26.959 --> 02:30.041
Or she!
Or she!

02:30.917 --> 02:33.500
Although it's probably a he.

02:33.542 --> 02:37.166
'Cause I can't think of a female
hero we've ever had.

02:37.208 --> 02:39.375
Who's it gonna be?
Who's gonna be our hero?

02:39.417 --> 02:42.208
Is it gonna be you?
Is it gonna be you?

02:42.250 --> 02:44.500
Nope. Is it gonna be you?
Or you?

02:44.542 --> 02:46.709
-I think we get it.
-We don't get it.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.875
'Cause I'm goin' around the
room. I stopped there.

02:48.917 --> 02:51.625
Why would I stop there when
I can go the whole way?
-[Dave]: I didn't know.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.834
You gotta stop interrupting
Coach. Where was I?

02:53.875 --> 02:56.000
Was I you there? Did I say you?
Is it gonna be you?

02:56.041 --> 02:58.166
Is it gonna be you?
You gonna be the hero?

02:58.208 --> 03:01.125
Are you gonna be the hero?
Or are you gonna be the hero?

03:01.166 --> 03:05.083
Or is it gonna be you?
Or is it gonna be you?

03:05.125 --> 03:07.291
You know what? You're right.
It feels long.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.458
It feels like I didn't have
to do everybody.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.166
Let's play today like it's the
first game...

03:12.208 --> 03:14.792
Of the rest of your lives.

03:14.834 --> 03:17.000
-Don't you mean the "last game
of the rest of your life?"

03:17.041 --> 03:20.083
Because technically every game
is the first game of the rest of
your life.

03:20.125 --> 03:22.250
-Is this the first game of the
year?
-The heart.

03:22.291 --> 03:24.834
-It's a proverb. You know
what a proverb is? You don't.
-Okay.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.917
On three Xavier!
One, two, three...

03:26.959 --> 03:29.083
-[All]: XAVIER!
-[Gerry]: Here we go. Come on.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.250
Let's go!

03:31.291 --> 03:34.500
Girls, okay girls, I can't
promise you're gonna play alot.

03:34.542 --> 03:40.083
Okay? Tuck your ponytails in
your helmets, so we don't
embarrass ourselves.

03:40.125 --> 03:42.458
Really? Nail polish?

03:42.500 --> 03:44.792
Blue, that's the other
team's colour.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.041
So you're already a traitor.
[Loudly]: Come on!

03:47.083 --> 03:49.750
Let's beat these guys!
Look who's last here.

03:59.291 --> 04:01.959
Thank you Delores. Thank you.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.417
-So, Bobbi, are you excited for
your time off?

04:04.458 --> 04:06.792
-I am. You know, I'm looking
forward to de-stressing.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.709
And focussing on me before
you-know-who comes along.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.792
[Laughs]: Right? And then
everything gets changed.

04:12.834 --> 04:15.208
-I can't believe you handed
over the reins to Gerry.

04:15.250 --> 04:18.583
Well, I've prepped him, right?
And he is a Phys Ed guy...

04:18.625 --> 04:20.750
So I'm not...
I'm not too worried.

04:20.792 --> 04:22.917
-I would be worried,
if it was me.

04:22.959 --> 04:25.250
-Really?
-He is one of the great morons.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.959
-[Laughs]: How badly can he
screw things up, right?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.250
[Bobbi continues to laugh
uncomfortably]: Right?

04:31.291 --> 04:33.500
[Ladies laugh]

04:33.542 --> 04:36.250
-Oh! Open another pressie!

04:36.291 --> 04:39.500
-I think I'm just going to
double check something
with Gerry first, okay?

04:39.542 --> 04:41.959
I'll be right back.

Here he goes again.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.208
Here he goes again.
Put a body on him!

04:48.250 --> 04:50.667
Same guy, same guy.
Here he goes.
-Stop him! Come on!

04:50.709 --> 04:53.458
-[Gerry]: Why don't you pass
the puck four?
[Buzzer sounds]

04:53.500 --> 04:55.625
-[Gerry]: Unbelievable.
[Players hit boards]

04:55.667 --> 04:58.166
-Number four again!
[Players hit the boards]

04:59.208 --> 05:01.333
-What the heck's this?

05:01.375 --> 05:03.625
-Time out, ref!
[Ref blows whistle]

05:03.667 --> 05:07.291
-[Meyers]: That was awesome.
-[Gerry]: Honestly? Time out
at ten-one? What are you doing?

05:07.333 --> 05:11.083
-[Dave]: I panicked.
-Unbelievable! One guy is
scoring all the goals.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.917
He has nine of the ten goals.
One player.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.208
I don't care if all five of you
go to number four.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.417
Try to stop one player.
-He's a machine.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.709
-He is a machine. It's getting
ridiculous though.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.083
-Hey, Gerry.
-Are you kidding me?
What do you want?

05:23.125 --> 05:27.000
-Did I remind you that you need
to keep the game balls separate
from the practice balls?

05:27.041 --> 05:29.542
-Yes, you did! Get off the
bench, I'm coaching!

05:29.583 --> 05:32.000
-I'm just checking if
I reminded you.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.792
[Laughs]: Ten-one.
-[Whispers]: Shut up.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.959
-Huh? You're off to a great
start.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.542
-That's all I need right now,
is you...
-[Bobbi]: Good job guys.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.792
-Look at number four!
-[Dave]: That's a good
lookin' man.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.125
-That's not a fifteen year old
boy with a full grown beard.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.750
That's an adult male. What the
hell's going on here?

05:49.792 --> 05:53.250
-Geez, you're right.
-Hey Coach, you called
a time-out?

05:53.291 --> 05:55.792
-Oh, that was me. Shoot more.
-Yeah, shoot more.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.959
-Xavier on three...
-We don't cheer a ten-one.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.625
Just go, try to stop
number four. Go!
[Whistle sounds]

06:00.667 --> 06:03.750
-[Gerry]: There's no way
he's fifteen.

-Well, someone looks happy.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.583
-Yeah, tomorrow's the big day.
-Oh?

06:09.625 --> 06:12.750
-I'm gonna propose to my lady,
check this out. What do you
think? Huh?

06:12.792 --> 06:16.125
-Oh wow. Oh, Paul.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.291
Wait.

06:18.333 --> 06:21.709
As in the same lady that's in
prison for murdering your
ex-wife?

06:21.750 --> 06:23.917
-That's the one.
-Okay.

06:23.959 --> 06:26.125
-Ha! Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.875
-I'm a little nervous, I'm
trying to think of a nice,
you know...

06:28.917 --> 06:31.041
Romantic spot to pop the
question. What do you think?

06:31.083 --> 06:34.834
-Okay, yeah...I just...Isn't the
visitors room the only option?

06:34.875 --> 06:37.917
Probably during visiting hours.
-Of course.

06:37.959 --> 06:40.375
-Yeah.
-Our special spot.
You're a genius. Thanks.

06:40.417 --> 06:43.000
-Hey Paul, do you think
this is a good idea?

06:43.041 --> 06:46.250
-What's that?
-Well, she's in there
for twenty five years.

06:46.291 --> 06:50.041
For murder. And um, I just
think, what's the rush?

06:50.083 --> 06:52.583
-Chance of parole in ten though.
-Okay.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.750
-Nisha, she's the love of my
life.
-Yes.

06:54.792 --> 06:58.000
-I better lock her down before
she meets somebody else, right?

06:58.041 --> 07:00.750
-Who's she gonna meet?
Who's she gonna...?

07:02.083 --> 07:05.166
-[Gerry]: Cheater. Cheater.
-Cheater.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.375
-[Gerry]: Big cheaters.
-[Dave]: Cheater, cheater,
cheater.

07:07.417 --> 07:11.166
-Hey, good game number four!
Holy smokes, you're some solid.

07:11.208 --> 07:14.542
-Uh, thanks...
-Great beard too, you
need a razor for that thing?

07:14.583 --> 07:16.458
-Okay...Bit much...
-Sorry.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.291
-Sorry about my friend here.
Just wanted to maybe check
some ID.

07:19.333 --> 07:22.083
Just to make sure you're
the right age.
-[Dave]: Government issued.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.250
-[Gerry]: Yeah.
-Can I help you?

07:24.291 --> 07:26.291
-Oh, hey Coach, we just uh...
Thought it might be a good idea

07:26.333 --> 07:30.000
to check the ID of number
four here. He looks a tad
older than the rest of the boys.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.250
-He's fifteen.
-I'm fifteen.

07:32.291 --> 07:35.125
-Well that's good to hear,
right? That you are really
fifteen.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.875
So then it shouldn't be a
problem to just prove it.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.083
-[Coach Meyers mutters]:
"It shouldn't be a problem..."

07:40.125 --> 07:42.500
Listen, loser, ya lost, okay?
So suck it up.

07:42.542 --> 07:46.500
How about you focus on
getting your loser team ready
for our rematch tomorrow?

07:46.542 --> 07:50.000
Instead of making false
accusations, like a loser,
loser.

07:50.041 --> 07:53.083
-Ouch.
-[Coach Meyers]: Loser.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.166
-See what's going on here?
-Yeah, he's in on it too.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.583
-Yeah, and it goes all the
way to the top.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.250
So game on.
-What are you gonna do, though?

08:03.291 --> 08:07.250
-I don't know yet.
But you said "game on."

08:07.291 --> 08:09.500
-Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna...

08:09.542 --> 08:12.583
I'm gonna do some...I don't
know. Stop with the questions.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.041
[♪ Music]
-[Dave]: Okay, wait for me.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.083
[♪ Music]
-[Gerry]: I don't have proof.

08:19.125 --> 08:22.041
But I'm pretty sure Central
is using an overage player.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.208
And as soon-to-be acting
Athletic-Director,

08:24.250 --> 08:26.083
I have some ethical standards to
uphold here at the school.

08:26.125 --> 08:29.542
-Well Gerry, unfortunately
without proof I can't file
an appeal.

08:29.583 --> 08:31.834
-What?
-You know the drill.

08:31.875 --> 08:34.000
Under the Cheeley
administration, Xavier teams

08:34.041 --> 08:36.166
are going to be all about,
losing with dignity.

08:36.208 --> 08:38.667
-Fine. Then I'm warning you...

08:38.709 --> 08:41.208
It's game on.
-What are you gonna do, Gerry?

08:41.250 --> 08:43.458
-I don't know yet. I'm gonna
do something though.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.875
-That sounds like a...A threat.
Like, it's kind of ominous.

08:45.917 --> 08:49.166
It's like saying, a storm's a
brewin' when it's a blue sky.
It doesn't make sense.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.291
-I know, I did it yesterday and
I trapped myself again.

08:51.333 --> 08:54.750
-So start with your end game and
reverse engineer what your catch
phrase is going to be.

08:54.792 --> 08:57.250
You could leave it vague like:
"We'll see."

08:57.291 --> 08:59.166
-I got it.
-[Robert]: I got it's kind
of weird.

08:59.208 --> 09:02.250
-No, ask me what I'm gonna do.
-What are you gonna do, Gerry?

09:02.291 --> 09:05.583
-Bingo.
-That's actually not bad.

09:05.625 --> 09:08.291
-[Gerry]: Alright, it's first
period six-nothing, how
is this possible?

09:08.333 --> 09:10.750
-Number four's killing us!
-[Gerry]: Yeah, I know that!

09:10.792 --> 09:12.750
-He's got all their goals!
-Yeah.

09:12.792 --> 09:15.792
-We should put 3 guys on him.
-Ya can't put three guys on
someone in hockey.

09:15.834 --> 09:17.959

your conscience wouldn't let
you go through with it.

18:32.709 --> 18:35.500
-I met somebody else.
See, Donna's got this cellmate.

18:35.542 --> 18:38.208
Her name's Cecilia. Mmm! Angel!

18:38.250 --> 18:40.375
Woo hoo!
[Laughs]

18:40.417 --> 18:44.208
-Paul, you realize that's
still a problem, right?

18:44.250 --> 18:47.709
-Okay, look, okay. Donna and I,
we got history, right?

18:47.750 --> 18:51.166
But Cecilia, she's only in
for manslaughter. It's good.

18:51.208 --> 18:53.333
-Yeah.
-[Dwyer]: Right?

18:53.375 --> 18:56.000
She's got what...
Three-to-five years? Pft!

18:56.041 --> 18:58.834
-Yeah, that's less bad.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.750
Okay.

19:00.792 --> 19:03.917
Maybe you want to try and
spend some time...

19:03.959 --> 19:07.166
Getting to know this other
criminal a little better.

19:07.208 --> 19:10.375
-You know what? You're right.
I'll schedule a prison visit.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.709
Speed dial.
-Speed dial the prison.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.583
-It's ringing! [Laughs]
-[Uneasy]: Yay.

19:16.625 --> 19:19.041
-Yeah, good day.
This is Paul Dwyer.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.750
I'd like to schedule a visit to
see Cecilia.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.166
-[Whispers]: For some time.
-[Dwyer]: Cecilia, yeah.
She's ah...

19:24.208 --> 19:26.083
Donna's cellmate.
-Cellmate.

19:26.125 --> 19:28.542
-Yeah, you know the one. Eyes
as deep as the ocean. You know.

19:28.583 --> 19:32.667
Yeah, that's the one...
What? What?

19:32.709 --> 19:37.083
[Loudly]: Nooooo! No! Come on!
-[Mouths]: What?

19:37.125 --> 19:40.208
Ugh! Ah.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.208
Alright, okay. Have a good one.

19:42.250 --> 19:45.417
-Is it bad news?
-Cecilia was strangled to death.

19:45.458 --> 19:48.917
In her cell last night.
Who would do that?

19:48.959 --> 19:51.417
-I have a hunch. Do you?

19:52.375 --> 19:55.083
No.
-Well...

19:55.125 --> 19:57.792
-No.
-Well...

19:57.834 --> 20:00.125
I guess if you can't decide
for yourself...

20:00.166 --> 20:03.166
The universe decides for you.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.750
Ahhh. Donna it is.

20:05.792 --> 20:09.667
[♪ Music]
-They all...Die...

20:12.458 --> 20:14.625
[♪ Music]
-Get it out of here.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.792
-That's mine.
-[Bobbi sighs]

20:16.834 --> 20:19.375
-This is silly that you're back
this quickly, you know that,
right?

20:19.417 --> 20:21.583
-This is my body, and it's my
choice okay?

20:21.625 --> 20:24.125
-Pft, okay.
-Ugh, crap!

20:24.166 --> 20:26.834
I'm leaking.
-Oh great, that's disgusting.

20:26.875 --> 20:29.041
-Look, could you just
watch Craig?

20:29.083 --> 20:31.250
And if he wakes up just stick
a soother in his mouth, okay?

20:31.291 --> 20:33.458
-Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Why can't you...?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.667
Can't you just bring him with
you?

20:35.709 --> 20:38.458
-Put the soother in his mouth.
It's easy! Thank you.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.750
-I don't even know what that is.

20:42.125 --> 20:46.041
Okay, alright.
What do I do here?
