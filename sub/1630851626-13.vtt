00:02.741 --> 00:04.221
What'd you buy
at the mall?

00:04.265 --> 00:07.050
Pimento cheese log.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.139
Never disappoints.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.709
[overlapping greetings]Hi, guys.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.103
Welcome to the
Valley Hills party bus.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.757
No music but lots of pills.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.543
How'd the appointment go?Oh, uh...

00:21.586 --> 00:23.980
What was it for? Was it
kidneys? Ticker? What?

00:24.024 --> 00:25.286
Fibromyalgia?

00:25.329 --> 00:27.157
What's that?When you hurt all over.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.289
Oh, I have that.Oh, I got that.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.246
Oh, yeah.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.595
It was for my heart arrhythmia.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.075
All my tests came back normal.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.163
I can go home now.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.338
Nice.
Wow.

00:34.382 --> 00:35.470
Congratulations.Good for you.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.298
Thanks. I'm really excited.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.343
Oh, we'll miss you.NORMA: Yeah.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.216
You're the only man here
who knows when he's farting.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.175
[horn honks][gasping]

00:45.219 --> 00:46.655
Gabby!
What now?

00:46.698 --> 00:47.569
Sorry.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.571
Hit the wrong pedal again.

00:51.442 --> 00:52.443
[door opens]GABBY: You wanted to see me?

00:52.487 --> 00:53.575
Yeah, come on in.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.794
Close the door.
Ugh.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.057
I'm all sticky.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.929
Got to take off my bra.No, wait. No.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.280
Okay, fine.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.282
Um... [clears throat]

01:05.326 --> 01:07.197
Before I say anything,

01:07.241 --> 01:10.635
remember: you are not talking
to Gina your friend,

01:10.679 --> 01:13.160
you are talking to
Gina your boss.

01:13.203 --> 01:16.032
Does either Gina have candy
in her desk?

01:16.076 --> 01:19.122
No. [sighs] Listen, um...

01:19.166 --> 01:22.169
There have been some complaints
about your driving.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.561
If this is about
the kid on the bike,

01:23.605 --> 01:25.824
he was scared, but he was fine.

01:26.521 --> 01:29.872
[sighs] You have forgotten
to pick up residents.

01:29.915 --> 01:31.395
You drive too fast.

01:31.439 --> 01:35.182
You tried to do donuts
in a church parking lot.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.923
Correction: did do donuts.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.752
And some of the residents
said they never felt more alive.

01:40.796 --> 01:44.104
They said they were lucky
to be alive.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.496
Gabby,

01:45.540 --> 01:47.933
I can't let you drive the van
anymore.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.326
What? No.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.936
I love driving the van.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.808
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.812
[door opens]Ow!

[chuckles]

02:26.233 --> 02:27.364
Hey, what are you doing?

02:27.408 --> 02:29.105
Well, I need to use
your laundry.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.455
A month on the road really
shows up in the skivvies.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.065
That's upsetting.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.589
That's life.

02:34.632 --> 02:37.809
Jerry! I heard the good news!

02:37.853 --> 02:39.202
DREW:
Yeah, congratulations!

02:39.246 --> 02:40.856
You finally get to go home.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.858
Can't wait. Tomorrow night
when I plop down on the couch,

02:42.901 --> 02:45.426
I won't have to worry about
sitting on someone's teeth.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.428
I am so happy for you.

02:47.471 --> 02:48.733
Ugh, it never occurred to me

02:48.777 --> 02:51.388
that someone might leave here,
you know, alive.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.174
[chuckles]What're you gonna do first?

02:54.217 --> 02:55.392
I'll probably check in
with my peeps,

02:55.436 --> 02:56.915
go to the city for dinner

02:56.959 --> 02:58.917
and reactivate
the old Tinder account.

02:58.961 --> 03:00.745
Ooh.Uh-oh. Watch out, ladies.

03:00.789 --> 03:03.226
Watch out, everyone.
[chuckles]

03:04.271 --> 03:05.663
Got to go pack some things.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.014
Hey, so, uh,
you want to grab lunch later?

03:09.058 --> 03:11.321
I can't. I have to drive the van
this afternoon.

03:11.365 --> 03:14.063
What happened to Gabby?The residents were complaining,

03:14.106 --> 03:16.370
so I told her
she can't drive the van anymore.

03:16.413 --> 03:19.460
C-E-Oh, no, you didn't.
[chuckles]

03:19.503 --> 03:21.418
Yeah, but now I have to find
a replacement.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.941
I could do it.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.291
What?
Yeah.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.075
I have van experience.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.207
Plus, old people love me.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.773
They think I'm one of them.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.515
That's because you say things
like "skivvies."

03:32.777 --> 03:34.431
You'd really be willing
to help me out?

03:34.475 --> 03:35.867
It doesn't pay much.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.826
Oh, come on.
You don't need to pay me.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.480
You're letting me live
in your parking lot.

03:39.523 --> 03:40.263
It's the least I could do.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.134
[sighs] Wow, thank you.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.354
The residents will
never again have to hear,

03:44.398 --> 03:47.139
[imitating Gabby]: "Hang on,
I'm gonna try something."

03:50.839 --> 03:53.711
Oh. On the right is
the Outback Steakhouse

03:53.755 --> 03:55.409
where I had my fifth grade
graduation dinner.

03:55.452 --> 03:56.888
[Australian accent]:
Crikey, mate, you're off

03:56.932 --> 03:58.281
to middle school.
Good on you. [laughs]

03:59.413 --> 04:00.849
Outback?

04:02.067 --> 04:03.330
Australia?

04:03.373 --> 04:05.114
Anybody?

04:05.810 --> 04:08.204
It's nice having a man
drive the van.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.293
Women get too emotional,

04:10.337 --> 04:12.295
on account of their cycles.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.951
Spend enough time with him,
Drew has cycles, too.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.519
Speaking as
an actual old person,

04:18.562 --> 04:20.477
why are you driving like one?

04:20.521 --> 04:22.392
Safety first,
second and third.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.829
Nary a complaint shall be heard.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.484
All right.

04:27.528 --> 04:30.052
[door opens]Here we are, Jerry,
your condominium,

04:30.095 --> 04:32.794
or as they say in Africa,
"your Congo-minium."

04:32.837 --> 04:34.317
[laughs]

04:34.361 --> 04:35.971
Imagine driving with him

04:36.014 --> 04:37.799
through Intercourse,
Pennsylvania.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.323
[giggling] Intercourse.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.411
JERRY:
Well...

04:41.455 --> 04:43.370
I hate long goodbyes.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.415
Great, get out.We'll miss you.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.547
Don't forget about us, kid.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.853
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.682
Don't you forget about me.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.467
No.
Not a chance.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.382
Well...

04:55.425 --> 04:56.644
bye.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.124
Bye.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.953
[door closes]

05:06.088 --> 05:08.699
Sure gonna miss ol'
what's-his-name.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.137
[scoffs]

05:12.181 --> 05:13.530
These sign-out sheets are
a mess.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.793
Do you even look
at what people write?

05:15.837 --> 05:17.665
No. Why?

05:17.708 --> 05:19.797
Well, for starters,

05:19.841 --> 05:22.844
there's no one here
named Soupy Sales.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.499
Not anymore.
He signed out.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.589
I'll take those, driver.

05:28.632 --> 05:29.459
Ah, it's Drew.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.374
Stay in your lane.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.377
Would you two ladies help me
pick out one of these dresses

05:34.421 --> 05:35.509
for a special occasion?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.380
Ooh, big date with Spencer?

05:37.424 --> 05:40.209
It's my great-grandson's
baptism.

05:40.252 --> 05:42.211
I want to look doable.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.431
Sure.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.694
What are you doing?
You have to stay here.

05:46.737 --> 05:49.566
If Drew can drive the van,
he can watch the desk.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.699
You know, I was
a hall monitor

05:51.742 --> 05:53.440
for four years
in my high school.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.485
They actually asked me back
first year of college.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.053
Not the brag you think it is.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.402
But fine, come on.

05:59.446 --> 06:02.884
Um, you're taking your meds,
right?

06:06.627 --> 06:08.629
[sighs][phone ringing]

06:14.852 --> 06:16.550
It's a beautiful day
at Valley Hills,

06:16.593 --> 06:17.812
how may I help you?

06:17.855 --> 06:19.640
All right, I'll transfer you.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.734
Hello?

06:26.777 --> 06:28.126
Oh, you're still there.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.477
Um... Just one moment.
[chuckles]

06:33.567 --> 06:35.656
Hey, what are you doing here?

06:35.699 --> 06:37.266
Oh, you know,
just helping out,

06:37.309 --> 06:39.181
manning the front desk,
driving the van.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.313
A Drew-of-all-trades,
if you will.
Hmm.

06:41.357 --> 06:44.099
You want to help Mr. Lambert
change his colostomy bag?

06:44.142 --> 06:47.537
Well, not "of all trades."Hmm.

06:47.581 --> 06:48.712
Seniors treating you well?

06:48.756 --> 06:50.540
They're great.
I'm learning a ton.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.412
Did you know that in the 1950s

06:52.455 --> 06:54.065
you could get a banana split
and a shoeshine for a quarter?

06:54.109 --> 06:56.154
Oh, yeah, they love telling
the gay, Black man

06:56.198 --> 06:57.982
how great life was in the '50s.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.723
Hey, we're all getting together

06:59.767 --> 07:01.203
at the Mexican place
across the street

07:01.246 --> 07:02.596
for happy hour after work.
You want to come?

07:02.639 --> 07:04.467
Yeah, I am so in.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.034
Uh, I do have a question.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.862
Do you share chips and guac?

07:07.905 --> 07:10.473
I just feel
that's a bit unsanitary.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.518
You know what? I'll do it.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.998
I'll do it. [chuckles]

07:15.043 --> 07:16.392
Yeah.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.611
[phone ringing]

07:20.918 --> 07:22.485
It's a beautiful day
at Valley Hills,

07:22.529 --> 07:23.965
how may I help you?

07:24.748 --> 07:26.620
Oh, you got disconnected?

07:26.663 --> 07:27.708
I don't know how that happened.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.579
Um, one moment, please.

07:31.842 --> 07:35.759
[crowd cheering on TV]Woah, that shot was, like,
from half-court.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.811
[cheering on TV][phone ringing]

07:46.422 --> 07:47.510
Hey, kid.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.772
Are you watching this game?

07:48.816 --> 07:51.035
Yeah, that shot was crazy.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.515
I wanted to see it on replay,

07:52.559 --> 07:54.778
but instead I'm looking
at Ryan Seacrest

07:54.822 --> 07:58.478
eating cotton candy
and winking at the camera.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.697
He does work hard, though.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.133
So, how are things

08:02.177 --> 08:03.526
at Valley Hills?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.223
We had soup for lunch.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.398
Ooh, what kind?

08:06.442 --> 08:08.488
Hot.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.793
I'm trying to watch the game.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.795
Uh, me, too.
I'll-I'll call you back

08:11.839 --> 08:13.144
if it goes into overtime.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.232
I can't wait.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.973
Ditto. [chuckles]

08:18.628 --> 08:20.674
[indistinct crowd chatter]

08:26.462 --> 08:27.898
Hey.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.421
You watching the game?

08:29.465 --> 08:30.510
Yeah.

08:37.952 --> 08:40.041
Morning.[gasps] Good morning!

08:40.084 --> 08:42.260
I got my favorite boss
her favorite drink--

08:42.304 --> 08:45.307
a nonfat,
bone-dry cappuccino.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.569
Ooh, thank you.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.744
I also got her
an assortment of pastries,

08:47.788 --> 08:49.616
including un croissant.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.009
[British accent]: Or perhaps
a cranberry scone, guv'nah.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.576
[chuckles]I forgot,

08:53.620 --> 08:55.796
you are a lot in the morning.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.319
Actually, I'm a bit tired.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.190
Tough to rouse
the old bag of bones

08:59.234 --> 09:02.019
after getting hit by
the passionfruit margarita bus.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.674
Oh, you went out last night?
With who?

09:04.718 --> 09:05.588
The work crew.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.069
That Bert guy is hilarious.

09:08.112 --> 09:10.027
You ever see him blow bubbles
out of his nose?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.073
So, you guys all went out
for drinks?

09:12.116 --> 09:14.684
Yeah. I got so tipsy,
I almost forgot to floss.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.295
How come no one invited me?

09:17.339 --> 09:19.776
Don't be upset, it's just
a regular Thursday thing.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.735
There's a regular
Thursday thing?

09:21.778 --> 09:23.214
Oh, um...

09:23.258 --> 09:24.738
Well, they probably
just figured you were busy,

09:24.781 --> 09:26.043
being the boss and all.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.871
I am,
but I still want to hang.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.612
I'm sure it was just
an oversight.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.092
Every Thursday night?

09:31.135 --> 09:32.746
Uh-oh.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.225
Somebody needs a bear claw.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.706
[roars]

09:42.407 --> 09:44.061
So, what do you think?
Does it fit?

09:44.105 --> 09:45.672
The only one left was
a ladies' medium.

09:45.715 --> 09:46.890
It's a little roomy.
You could probably get away

09:46.934 --> 09:49.197
with a ladies' small.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.504
What's up, boss?Hey.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.071
Hi.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.682
Gideon, your rounds should have
started five minutes ago.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.509
Oh, I was just having
my coffee first.

09:57.553 --> 09:58.685
Great, if someone dies

09:58.728 --> 10:00.164
because they didn't get
their meds,

10:00.208 --> 10:01.731
we'll list
the cause of death as:

10:01.775 --> 10:03.341
"I was just having
my coffee first."

10:03.385 --> 10:07.084
[chuckles] Torched.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.826
And you need to refill
the hand sanitizer stations,

10:09.870 --> 10:12.829
unless you're too hungover
from happy hour.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.793
How does she know
about happy hour?

10:19.836 --> 10:23.492
Yeah, that's weird.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.713
I may have said something.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.803
I definitely said something.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.195
Why would you do that?

10:31.239 --> 10:33.589
I thought she was invited.It's an employee hang.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.113
You can't vent about the boss
to the boss.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.724
That's like confiding
in your boyfriend

10:37.767 --> 10:39.508
about the guy
you hooked up with.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.771
You're the one who wanted
an open relationship, Keith.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.730
Uh, come on,

10:43.773 --> 10:45.296
this is Gina.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.124
She's your boss,
but she's also your friend.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.695
If we did invite her,
I bet she'd pick up the check.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.742
We don't really take advantage
of her being rich.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.526
'Cause we're good people.

10:57.569 --> 11:00.007
Well, that stops right now.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.186
[lively chatter]Hey, guys!

11:05.229 --> 11:06.883
[overlapping greetings]Oh, there she is.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.798
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

11:08.842 --> 11:09.799
Don't be silly.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.714
We just want to hang
with you.

11:11.758 --> 11:12.889
Yeah, but we can't stay late.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.195
Everybody here is kind of
on a budget.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.893
Mm.Not tonight you're not.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.808
[excited chatter]

11:18.852 --> 11:20.854
Gideon, why don't you get us
a couple orders

11:20.897 --> 11:22.725
of shrimp fajitas.

11:22.769 --> 11:23.900
[scattered cheers]

11:23.944 --> 11:25.249
Hell yes! [chuckles]

11:25.293 --> 11:27.904
Um, but seriously,
I can't have shellfish.

11:27.948 --> 11:30.211
Diarrhea, I remember.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.909
Um, so...
[clears throat]

11:32.953 --> 11:34.737
what're you guys talking about?

11:34.781 --> 11:35.825
Just getting to know
the new guy.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.871
Heard you're living
in the parking lot.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.699
Oh, just until I figure out
my next move.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.396
FYI,
you ever need to shower,

11:41.439 --> 11:44.791
the sprinklers come on
every night at 2:00 a.m.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.618
GINA:
Gabby,

11:46.662 --> 11:49.447
I really want tonight to be
like old times.Me, too.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.841
Remember how we'd get hammered
and dance on the bar?

11:51.885 --> 11:53.974
Uh, only reason
I wore underwear.

11:54.017 --> 11:57.586
Hey, hey, hey![whooping]

11:57.629 --> 11:58.848
Hey! Mmm.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.982
Mmm! Yikes. That is salty.[chuckles]: Yeah.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.331
Oh, you want salty,
you should hear

12:03.374 --> 12:04.941
Althea talk about
her ex-husband.

12:04.985 --> 12:05.986
[chuckles]

12:06.029 --> 12:07.335
He slept with my sister.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.511
I'm glad it's funny to you.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.776
Um, Bert, uh,
this reminds me,

12:13.820 --> 12:15.822
I think we should cut back
on the sodium

12:15.865 --> 12:16.910
in the residents' meals.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.085
You got it.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.652
That's salt, right?

12:21.653 --> 12:23.960
Hey, while I have you all,
let's make a mental note

12:24.004 --> 12:25.701
to check the smoke alarms
next week.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.357
It's battery changing season.
What-what!

12:30.358 --> 12:31.968
Gina, we don't usually
talk work here.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.796
Oh, right. Right, right. Sorry.Yeah.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.059
Yeah, um, we're off the clock.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.844
Mm-hmm.Hey, what are you doing
this weekend?

12:37.887 --> 12:39.497
Oh, I'm actually
taking Monday off.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.803
I'm going on a hiking trip
with some friends.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.413
Oh, that sounds great.

12:42.457 --> 12:43.980
Just remember to put in
your time card tomorrow

12:44.024 --> 12:45.547
'cause they're due
on Friday now.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.418
Gabby, you sent that email
to everyone, right?

12:47.462 --> 12:49.899
I could check, but I sent it
from my work computer,

12:49.943 --> 12:51.205
and we're not at work.Hmm.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.033
Starting to feel like it.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.818
So sorry. So, so, so sorry.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.864
[chuckles] Okay.
No more work talk.

12:57.907 --> 12:58.908
[sighs]

12:58.952 --> 13:02.303
[music playing faintly]

13:04.174 --> 13:06.002
This isn't completely
work-related,

13:06.046 --> 13:08.526
but I was thinking about
taking an ad out

13:08.570 --> 13:12.008
for Valley Hills
in the AARP Magazine.

13:12.487 --> 13:16.230
That's the American Association
of Retired People.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.930
What-what. [chuckles]

13:22.714 --> 13:23.933
[sighs] Spencer,

13:23.977 --> 13:24.934
if you're gonna be my partner,

13:24.978 --> 13:26.544
you got to wear your readers.

13:26.588 --> 13:27.632
I don't need 'em.

13:27.676 --> 13:28.895
Oh, really?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.026
What card is this?

13:31.593 --> 13:32.899
Back up a little.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.249
Hi, guys.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.077
Hey, kiddo.Hey, Jerry.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.905
So, you gave my spot to Bert?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.036
Yeah, we needed a fourth.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.646
I'm just learning the game.

13:41.690 --> 13:45.041
Yet somehow you've won
every hand.Dumb luck.

13:45.085 --> 13:48.044
Yeah, unless you're hustling us.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.786
Oh.Norma, look at this man.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.616
Which one do you think it is?

13:54.659 --> 13:56.009
[chuckles]

13:56.052 --> 13:57.358
It's up to you, Spencer.

13:58.054 --> 14:01.492
Oh, dear,
I hope this is right.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.539
All right, guys,
good seeing you.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.149
I'm gonna go check out
the action in the day room.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.021
See if I can rustle up
a game of Yahtzee.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.631
Okay, have fun.See you later, kid.

14:09.674 --> 14:10.893
See you, guys.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.373
We'll see ya.Hearts? Anybody?

14:12.416 --> 14:14.984
Oh.NORMA: All right...

14:15.028 --> 14:16.464
Oh, poop.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.987
Whoa, Jerry!

14:18.031 --> 14:19.946
Hey, what happened
to you guys last night?

14:19.989 --> 14:21.686
Why did you take off so early?

14:21.730 --> 14:24.472
Oh, I, uh, got a text
from my landlord.

14:24.515 --> 14:28.693
My apartment flooded, uh,
from the bathtub right above it.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.957
No way! Me, too!

14:32.045 --> 14:33.785
Okay. What's going on?

14:33.829 --> 14:35.918
Well, no offense,

14:35.962 --> 14:37.964
but you kind of turned the night
into a staff meeting.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.575
I thought that, too!

14:40.618 --> 14:42.055
No, I didn't.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.970
You talked about
time cards, Gina.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.580
Time cards.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.975
And exciting new breakthroughs
in catheter hygiene.

14:49.018 --> 14:52.848
So, I mentioned a couple
work things. No big deal.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.719
It's all you care about anymore.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.634
Well, I'm sorry
I'm worried about 25 people

14:56.678 --> 14:58.419
who could drop dead
at any second.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.030
Not you guys,
you're doing great.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.685
That's fine, but...

15:03.728 --> 15:05.469
when's the last time
we really hung out,

15:05.513 --> 15:08.342
or you called
to just catch up?[beeping]

15:09.082 --> 15:10.431
Oh, God!
That's Norma's alert.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.954
Spencer and Harry's, too.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.261
Is everything okay?
What happened?

15:14.304 --> 15:15.958
Jerry fainted.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.307
It must be my arrhythmia.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.961
We should get you
to a hospital.I'll drive.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.963
ALL:
No!

15:21.007 --> 15:22.530
I don't need to go
to the hospital.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.140
I can see my doctor tomorrow.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.055
Oh, you shouldn't be alone
tonight.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.056
Uh, why don't you
just stay here?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.840
Your old room is still empty.

15:28.884 --> 15:32.018
I guess,
if you think that's best.GINA: Yeah.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.150
Welcome back to Shawshank, kid.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.630
Come on. I'll walk you.There you go.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.197
GINA: You got it?You all right?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.894
JERRY: Yeah.All right.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.114
You still think I care too much
about work?

15:41.157 --> 15:42.724
I care about the residents.

15:42.767 --> 15:43.943
I care more.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.771
I got the defibrillator.

15:46.815 --> 15:47.990
Jerry's okay.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.383
Oh, good.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.734
Anybody want to try
this baby on me?

15:57.217 --> 15:59.132
Hey, Gina.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.308
Gina?

16:01.351 --> 16:04.180
What? Oh, h-hi.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.966
You okay?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.838
You're staring into that fire
like you want to jump in.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.100
Oh...

16:11.144 --> 16:12.797
You don't want to hear it.

16:12.841 --> 16:15.800
Normally, but for you
I'll make an exception.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.543
[sighs]
It's just...

16:19.587 --> 16:22.590
My friends don't get
how hard my job is.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.767
I can't just turn it off
to go hang.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.116
Mm-hmm.

16:28.465 --> 16:31.120
Did I ever tell you about
the body shop I owned?

16:31.164 --> 16:32.426
I don't think so.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.036
Yeah, I opened it right
after Beth was born.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.299
I was terrified
that I would fail,

16:36.343 --> 16:38.736
so I-I pretty much
lived there.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.042
See, you get it.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.044
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I couldn't...

16:42.088 --> 16:44.351
I couldn't think of
anything else, do anything else,

16:44.394 --> 16:46.788
and sometimes I even
slept in my office.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.182
I fell asleep in my car
a few weeks ago.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.879
I woke up
in the middle of the night

16:50.922 --> 16:54.187
and saw Bert showering
in the sprinklers.

16:54.230 --> 16:55.927
[chuckles]

16:55.971 --> 16:57.016
He's an odd bird.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.061
[laughs]Anyway,

16:59.105 --> 17:01.629
so, about a year later,

17:01.672 --> 17:04.414
I came home one night
and Meredith was gone.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.069
Took Beth
and went to her sister's.

17:07.113 --> 17:10.203
Didn't she understand you were
just trying to build a business?

17:10.246 --> 17:11.987
No, she was trying to get
my attention.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.294
See, I was so consumed
with providing for my family

17:14.337 --> 17:17.558
that I... I forgot I had one.

17:18.298 --> 17:21.605
[sighs] But, uh, you still had
responsibilities.

17:21.649 --> 17:24.478
You couldn't just walk away
from the shop.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.306
No, no, no, but...

17:26.349 --> 17:27.655
but a few nights a week,

17:27.698 --> 17:29.309
I made sure that I'd be home
for dinner.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.702
And Sundays were
for Beth and Meredith.

17:31.746 --> 17:35.619
So, you see,
I found a balance.

17:37.230 --> 17:40.059
Hmm. You know,

17:40.102 --> 17:41.843
when you're willing to talk,

17:41.886 --> 17:43.279
you're, uh,

17:43.323 --> 17:45.107
you're actually
pretty good at it.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.108
[chuckles]

17:46.152 --> 17:47.196
You know the old saying:

17:47.240 --> 17:48.589
"I may have been born yesterday,

17:48.632 --> 17:50.982
but I stayed up late
last night."

17:51.026 --> 17:55.726
[laughs] Uh, would you, uh,
like some wine?

17:55.770 --> 17:58.207
No, no, no. I don't
want to mix wine

17:58.251 --> 17:59.817
with my bourbon.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.302
Nice shot.
Thanks.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.521
I put a little English on it.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.827
Uh, that's still okay to say,
right?

18:09.871 --> 18:10.654
I think so.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.308
GIDEON:
So, Jerry,

18:12.352 --> 18:15.050
I had a doctor look
at the EKG we did for you.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.749
Your heart rhythms
are totally normal.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.316
Really?DREW: Yeah.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.970
It must've been
something else.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.233
I mean, obviously
you didn't faint for no reason.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.887
That's interesting.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.367
I'll schedule
a doctor's appointment

18:27.410 --> 18:29.064
and get to the bottom of it.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.502
Jerry.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.896
Tell Gideon what's going on.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.898
And also tell Drew.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.207
I was lonely at my place.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.469
I missed everybody.

18:42.512 --> 18:45.254
So you pretended to faint
to stay here?

18:45.298 --> 18:47.343
I really like Valley Hills.

18:47.387 --> 18:48.910
I learned to play boccie.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.172
I take art classes.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.957
I have friends,
and not just on Xbox.

18:53.001 --> 18:56.004
I understand that, but you need
to tell Gina the truth.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.614
Yeah, I'm sure she'd love
for you to stay.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.616
You don't think it's weird
that a 59-year-old

18:59.660 --> 19:01.531
wants to stay
in a retirement home?

19:01.575 --> 19:03.359
Oh, it's definitely weird.

19:03.403 --> 19:06.667
But one thing I learned
while living on the road is,

19:06.710 --> 19:08.451
you got to do
what makes you happy.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.062
Wh-What if
what makes you happy is

19:11.106 --> 19:13.543
socially unacceptable
and possibly illegal?

19:13.587 --> 19:15.110
You want to elaborate on that?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.242
No, he doesn't.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.157
Welcome back, Jerry.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.464
Yeah, welcome back.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.083
[knocks]You wanted to see us?

19:32.127 --> 19:33.215
Oh, yeah, come on in.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.130
Um, sit down.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.218
[sighs heavily]

19:36.262 --> 19:38.307
Okay.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.657
Um... [chuckles]

19:41.571 --> 19:44.052
[sighs] Where do I start?

19:44.095 --> 19:46.402
It was Gideon's idea
to rig the bingo game.

19:46.446 --> 19:47.534
Seriously?

19:47.577 --> 19:49.057
You're just gonna throw me
under the bus?

19:49.100 --> 19:50.363
I need this job.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.365
I owe people money.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.541
Bad people.

19:54.584 --> 19:58.109
Let's table that
for another day.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.069
[sighs]

20:01.591 --> 20:03.637
I just want to apologize
to you both.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.813
BOTH:
Oh.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.817
I've been so wrapped up
in being a boss that...

20:09.860 --> 20:11.427
I haven't been
a very good friend.

20:11.471 --> 20:12.646
So going forward,

20:12.689 --> 20:17.085
I'm really gonna try hard to...

20:17.128 --> 20:18.695
find balance.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.393
Thanks.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.873
I love you, and I want you
to be part of my life.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.789
Me, too.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.270
Bring it in.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.793
[all grunt]

20:29.837 --> 20:33.406
Gabby, you really got
to wear a bra.
