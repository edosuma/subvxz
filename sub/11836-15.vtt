WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.468
BERLUTI:
Previously on The Practice.

00:02.503 --> 00:04.137
You understand
I confessed.

00:04.170 --> 00:05.939
DOLE: I do,
but you only confessed

00:05.971 --> 00:08.975
after they discovered
the body in the trunk.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
If we can suppress
the search,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.646
the confession
goes out too.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.548
I just don't want to go
to a prison.

00:14.581 --> 00:16.449
Anything to keep me
out of prison.

00:16.482 --> 00:18.151
DOLE: I understand.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.820
You answer only
what I ask you,

00:19.853 --> 00:21.187
nothing more,
because, uh--

00:21.221 --> 00:23.056
I strangled her.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.325
I know you're ill,

00:25.358 --> 00:27.027
and I know
you wanna get better.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.529
Her name was Carol.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.664
She was very nice to me.

00:30.697 --> 00:31.932
You didn't know
there was a body

00:31.965 --> 00:33.466
in the trunk, did you?

00:33.499 --> 00:34.668
Not before he opened it, no.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.436
HILLER: The search
and confession

00:36.469 --> 00:37.971
are hereby suppressed,

00:38.004 --> 00:39.506
the charges are dismissed,

00:39.540 --> 00:40.373
and the defendant,

00:40.406 --> 00:43.176
I'm horrified to say,

00:43.209 --> 00:44.578
is free to go.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.046
I can just walk out?

00:46.079 --> 00:47.080
Yes.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.949
But you still
wanna get some help.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.851
There's no need to now, right?

00:53.820 --> 00:54.988
Thank you, Lindsay.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.401
It's not a conspiracy.

01:01.434 --> 01:02.936
I simply can't understand

01:02.969 --> 01:04.037
how two different people

01:04.069 --> 01:05.271
could pick him
out of a lineup

01:05.305 --> 01:07.874
without some
police collusion.

01:07.908 --> 01:09.442
BERLUTI: It just means
he looks like

01:09.475 --> 01:11.011
whoever this killer is.

01:11.044 --> 01:12.513
They've offered murder two.

01:13.947 --> 01:16.416
You're certainly
not suggesting

01:16.449 --> 01:18.084
that we consider that.

01:20.253 --> 01:22.689
(sighs)

01:22.723 --> 01:26.192
We know
you're innocent, but...

01:26.226 --> 01:28.629
But what?

01:28.662 --> 01:30.463
There's a kind of
a swell here.

01:30.496 --> 01:31.865
I don't need
to tell you that.

01:31.898 --> 01:33.399
The media
doesn't get a vote.

01:33.433 --> 01:35.435
Please. Don't kid
yourself, Mrs. Bakey.

01:35.468 --> 01:37.137
The influence of the media

01:37.170 --> 01:39.239
seeps into that jury room.

01:39.272 --> 01:40.941
They weren't sequestered.

01:40.974 --> 01:42.408
A lot of them will be
watching the news

01:42.442 --> 01:44.444
despite the judge's
instructions.

01:44.477 --> 01:45.512
The witnesses are credible,

01:45.546 --> 01:47.080
persuasive demeanors,

01:47.113 --> 01:48.982
and...
What about me?

01:49.015 --> 01:51.217
You don't find me
persuasive?

01:51.852 --> 01:53.086
You're his mother.

01:53.119 --> 01:55.889
I am also truthful.

01:55.922 --> 01:57.924
RUSSELL: Look,
I cooperated fully.

01:57.958 --> 01:59.392
Uh, I gave them DNA samples.

01:59.425 --> 02:01.001
I let them search
my house,

02:01.034 --> 02:01.835
my car.

02:01.868 --> 02:04.738
I've never broken any law.

02:04.771 --> 02:05.972
Are you actually telling me

02:06.006 --> 02:08.341
that I could go away for life

02:08.374 --> 02:10.511
simply because I happen
to look like somebody?

02:12.112 --> 02:14.881
Like somebody who stabbed
three women.

02:19.786 --> 02:23.023
(music playing)

03:09.776 --> 03:10.911
Russell Bakey,

03:10.944 --> 03:12.112
better known as the alleged

03:12.145 --> 03:13.580
supermarket killer,

03:13.614 --> 03:15.381
finally goes on trial today

03:15.415 --> 03:17.483
for the murders
of three south end women.

03:17.518 --> 03:19.720
Rumors of a last-minute
plea agreement

03:19.753 --> 03:20.854
have turned out to be false.

03:20.887 --> 03:22.022
Is he guilty?

03:23.489 --> 03:24.658
Eugene doesn't think so.

03:24.691 --> 03:26.459
<i>MAN (over TV): ...now rest</i>
<i>in the hands of the jury.</i>

03:26.492 --> 03:28.361
(door opens)

03:28.394 --> 03:29.630
Lindsay.

03:29.663 --> 03:30.964
Mr. Deeks?

03:32.098 --> 03:33.333
I have a situation.

03:35.902 --> 03:37.003
Who is this person?

03:37.037 --> 03:38.705
She's a lawyer
I work with.

03:38.739 --> 03:39.840
Claire Wyatt,

03:39.873 --> 03:41.407
Stanley Deeks.

03:42.609 --> 03:43.677
What's wrong?

03:43.710 --> 03:45.345
I need to speak in private.

03:45.378 --> 03:47.113
Actually,
lawyer-client privilege

03:47.147 --> 03:48.048
extends to her, Stanley,

03:48.081 --> 03:49.783
you can speak freely.

03:49.816 --> 03:51.451
What's the situation?

03:52.953 --> 03:54.354
I had a relapse.

03:54.855 --> 03:55.756
A relapse?

03:57.457 --> 04:00.026
I made a friend.

04:00.060 --> 04:01.201
She was only 14,

04:01.234 --> 04:03.403
but we had a lot in common,

04:03.436 --> 04:04.437
and...

04:07.774 --> 04:09.209
I befriended her.

04:09.242 --> 04:10.777
You befriended her?

04:10.811 --> 04:11.945
Yes.

04:11.978 --> 04:14.014
Where is your friend now,
Stanley?

04:15.348 --> 04:16.583
She's away.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.451
Away? Where away?

04:18.483 --> 04:20.553
I need to get help, Lindsay.

04:22.623 --> 04:24.758
I thought I was better,

04:26.593 --> 04:28.294
but I'm not.

04:28.328 --> 04:31.632
Stanley, did you kill
this girl?

04:39.272 --> 04:41.407
I was loading my groceries
into the car

04:41.441 --> 04:42.242
when I saw them.

04:42.275 --> 04:43.944
By them, you mean...

04:43.977 --> 04:46.079
HEPLER: The defendant
and the woman

04:46.112 --> 04:47.080
in the poster on the left,

04:47.113 --> 04:48.849
Heidi Stevens.

04:48.882 --> 04:49.816
GAMBLE: What were they doing?

04:49.850 --> 04:50.584
HEPLER: At first, I thought

04:50.617 --> 04:52.085
they were together.

04:52.118 --> 04:53.419
But then I gathered

04:53.453 --> 04:54.888
he was offering to help

04:54.921 --> 04:56.022
jump-start her car.

04:56.056 --> 04:58.024
The battery was dead
or something.

04:58.058 --> 04:59.425
It was a bitter cold night.

04:59.459 --> 05:01.034
Did she accept his offer?

05:01.067 --> 05:02.268
Yes.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.937
GAMBLE: Do you know
whether or not

05:03.970 --> 05:05.806
he was able to help
start her car?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.173
No.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.709
They were still working
on it when I left,

05:08.742 --> 05:09.810
so I don't know.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.112
Are you positive

05:12.145 --> 05:13.346
that this is the man

05:13.379 --> 05:15.882
you saw that night
with Heidi Stevens?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.751
Very positive.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.053
They were only about
20 feet away from me.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.056
BERLUTI: Were you able
to describe for the police

05:23.089 --> 05:25.025
what this man
was wearing that night?

05:25.058 --> 05:27.393
Not enough to give
a specific description.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.795
Was he wearing a hat?

05:28.829 --> 05:29.796
Yes.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.297
Can you describe that?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.899
It was a knit hat.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.668
Pulled down a little over
his forehead?

05:34.701 --> 05:36.703
It didn't cover his face.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.005
You mentioned it being cold.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.473
Do you remember how cold?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.809
I believe
it was in the teens.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.545
And yet you kind of
took time out

05:44.578 --> 05:45.846
from loading your groceries

05:45.879 --> 05:47.581
on this cold night

05:47.614 --> 05:50.416
to check out his man's face.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.152
How long do you think
you looked at him?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.286
I really don't know.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.188
Long enough for it
to make an impression.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.157
More than five seconds?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.324
Probably not.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.359
And this was at night.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.502
The parking lot
was well-lit.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.203
You saw him for less than

06:03.236 --> 06:05.105
five seconds at night.

06:05.138 --> 06:07.107
And picked him
out of a lineup.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.843
Before or after
you saw his face

06:09.876 --> 06:10.944
on the news?

06:12.212 --> 06:13.013
After.

06:13.046 --> 06:15.616
BERLUTI: Is it possible,
Mrs. Hepler,

06:15.649 --> 06:16.817
that when you went to view

06:16.850 --> 06:18.685
this police lineup,

06:18.719 --> 06:20.621
you recognized my client

06:20.654 --> 06:22.422
because you'd just
seen his face

06:22.455 --> 06:23.423
on the news?

06:23.456 --> 06:26.459
I recognized him
from both the news

06:26.492 --> 06:28.394
and the parking lot.

06:33.534 --> 06:34.901
DEEKS: That's the address.

06:34.935 --> 06:36.202
Nobody lives there.

06:36.236 --> 06:37.037
That's why we'd go there

06:37.070 --> 06:38.505
because the house was empty.

06:41.207 --> 06:43.710
We never had sex
or anything.

06:43.744 --> 06:46.046
I'm not sick that way.

06:46.079 --> 06:48.615
How...

06:48.649 --> 06:51.217
(sighs)

06:51.251 --> 06:52.753
what happened?

06:53.319 --> 06:55.556
I squeezed too tightly

06:55.589 --> 06:56.723
around her neck.

06:59.025 --> 07:00.767
I'm pretty sure she's dead.

07:01.334 --> 07:03.169
Pretty sure?

07:03.203 --> 07:04.638
You--you're not positive?

07:04.671 --> 07:06.039
Well, uh,

07:06.072 --> 07:07.207
it's been two days,

07:07.240 --> 07:08.975
and she hasn't gone home.

07:09.009 --> 07:09.776
Uh, at least, that's what

07:09.810 --> 07:11.978
they're saying in the news.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.316
You think maybe
they're trying to trick me?

07:18.384 --> 07:19.285
(gasps)

07:20.654 --> 07:22.823
I'd turn myself in,

07:22.856 --> 07:24.725
but I don't want
to go to prison.

07:26.059 --> 07:29.195
Uh, I want to get better.

07:29.229 --> 07:30.496
And I'm afraid

07:30.531 --> 07:33.099
for me to get better,

07:33.133 --> 07:34.901
I'm gonna have
to tell the doctors

07:34.935 --> 07:35.636
what I did.

07:35.669 --> 07:39.272
And if I do...

07:39.305 --> 07:40.874
they'll tell the police.

07:43.143 --> 07:45.378
I don't know what to do.

07:55.989 --> 07:57.190
MCGUIRE:
This is the security video

07:57.223 --> 07:58.792
taken from inside the market.

07:58.825 --> 08:00.133
This was taken the night

08:00.166 --> 08:01.467
Wendy Banks was killed?

08:01.502 --> 08:02.402
MCGUIRE: Yes.

08:02.435 --> 08:05.772
That's her
at the checkout counter.

08:05.806 --> 08:08.742
And if we fast-forward
to here

08:08.775 --> 08:10.276
that's the defendant

08:10.310 --> 08:11.712
paying for his groceries.

08:12.212 --> 08:14.748
GAMBLE: Detective,
after arresting the defendant,

08:14.781 --> 08:16.216
did you have opportunity

08:16.249 --> 08:17.417
to search his car?

08:17.450 --> 08:18.384
Yes, we did.

08:18.418 --> 08:20.320
Could you tell us
what you found?

08:20.353 --> 08:22.689
Jumper cables, tool kit,

08:22.723 --> 08:23.857
his jack was out

08:23.890 --> 08:25.458
like it had recently been used,

08:25.491 --> 08:26.426
and some box cutters

08:26.459 --> 08:28.595
we think were used
to slash tires.

08:28.629 --> 08:30.697
What, if anything,
did you conclude?

08:30.731 --> 08:32.432
That these were
the instrument he used

08:32.465 --> 08:34.934
to disable cars
and also repair them.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.068
We think that was his MO

08:36.102 --> 08:37.604
for approaching women,

08:37.638 --> 08:38.938
disabling their cars

08:38.972 --> 08:40.506
and then coming to their rescue.

08:41.741 --> 08:42.708
BERLUTI:
Any video that shows

08:42.743 --> 08:44.310
my client had contact

08:44.344 --> 08:45.211
with Wendy Banks

08:45.245 --> 08:45.946
in the store?

08:45.979 --> 08:47.413
No.

08:47.447 --> 08:49.415
BERLUTI: And this was
a different grocery store

08:49.449 --> 08:50.416
from where the other
two victims

08:50.450 --> 08:52.052
were last seen, right,
Detective?

08:52.085 --> 08:52.986
That's correct.

08:53.019 --> 08:54.454
All three victims
were last seen

08:54.487 --> 08:55.722
at different grocery stores.

08:56.189 --> 08:57.958
BERLUTI: And the box cutters,

08:57.991 --> 08:59.960
you said you think
had been used

08:59.993 --> 09:01.568
to slash tires,

09:01.602 --> 09:03.236
could you positively
connect them

09:03.269 --> 09:04.638
to Susan Graham's tire?

09:04.671 --> 09:05.906
No.

09:05.939 --> 09:08.174
You also searched
my client's house,

09:08.208 --> 09:09.142
correct, Detective?

09:09.175 --> 09:10.143
Yes.

09:10.176 --> 09:11.344
Were you able to find

09:11.377 --> 09:13.246
any physical evidence

09:13.279 --> 09:15.716
connecting my client
with these murders?

09:15.749 --> 09:17.017
No.

09:18.985 --> 09:20.521
YOUNG: I actually think
that the most damning

09:20.554 --> 09:22.222
piece of evidence
is the video.

09:22.255 --> 09:23.624
Why?
YOUNG: Well, it's one thing

09:23.657 --> 09:25.325
to argue a look-alike.

09:25.358 --> 09:26.459
But on top of that,

09:26.492 --> 09:27.894
we know for a fact

09:27.928 --> 09:29.996
that he just
so happened to shop

09:30.030 --> 09:31.497
in the same grocery store

09:31.532 --> 09:33.433
at the same time
of the last victim

09:33.466 --> 09:35.301
on the night she disappeared.

09:35.335 --> 09:37.403
But I live near the store.

09:37.437 --> 09:38.505
Understood,
but those are two

09:38.539 --> 09:40.574
very big coincidences,
Russell.

09:40.607 --> 09:42.242
SYLVIA: Not to be critical,

09:42.275 --> 09:43.710
but I'm a little disappointed

09:43.744 --> 09:45.011
in your performance
so far.

09:45.045 --> 09:46.146
Mrs. Bakey--

09:46.179 --> 09:47.981
Here we have an innocent man,

09:48.014 --> 09:49.415
no scientific,

09:49.449 --> 09:50.350
no forensic evidence

09:50.383 --> 09:51.952
whatsoever against him,

09:51.985 --> 09:54.521
and yet you speak
as a defeatist.

09:54.555 --> 09:57.090
I speak as a realist.

09:57.123 --> 09:58.525
The public wants
to lynch somebody.

09:58.559 --> 10:01.134
Right now, your son
is the only offering.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.605
May I continue, please?

10:05.238 --> 10:06.406
Certainly.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.874
Thank you.

10:08.842 --> 10:12.145
Russell, you'll go first.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.980
We'll follow that up
with your mother,

10:14.014 --> 10:15.381
who we know will make
every effort

10:15.415 --> 10:16.650
to come off sympathetic.

10:19.686 --> 10:20.554
Are you ready?

10:20.587 --> 10:22.388
SYLVIA: He's ready.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.161
Helen Gamble will come hard.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.229
Be prepared, Russell.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.932
She'll come straight for you.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.333
With what?
I've got nothing really

10:33.366 --> 10:34.334
to cross him with.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.135
WALSH: Yes, you do.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.070
Good-looking guy, nice job,

10:37.103 --> 10:38.171
makes a lot of money,

10:38.204 --> 10:39.272
lives with his mother.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.006
Come on.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.342
It doesn't make him
a murderer.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.844
It makes him weird.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.779
He's probably a closet homo
or something.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.548
Okay. Let's go with that.

10:47.581 --> 10:48.381
If he's secretly gay,

10:48.414 --> 10:49.516
then he's sure to kill.

10:49.550 --> 10:51.985
Helen, we both know
this is the killer.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.987
Get him to flash his rage.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.088
Push him.

10:55.121 --> 10:55.856
If he doesn't emote,

10:55.889 --> 10:57.390
we'll paint him as cold.

10:57.423 --> 10:58.659
If he does flare,

10:58.692 --> 11:00.701
we'll argue
that he's a man of rage.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.871
Also, get as close to him
as you can.

11:04.905 --> 11:06.139
Why?

11:06.172 --> 11:08.208
Because you're the prototype

11:08.241 --> 11:09.510
of the women he kills.

11:11.912 --> 11:13.547
I want the jury to picture
the victims

11:13.580 --> 11:14.781
when you question him.

11:16.116 --> 11:17.450
I don't know.

11:17.483 --> 11:20.220
WALSH: Look, I agree,

11:20.253 --> 11:22.222
our case is thin,

11:22.255 --> 11:25.358
which makes this cross pivotal.

11:25.391 --> 11:27.728
You need to push him.

11:30.797 --> 11:32.065
Go there?

11:32.098 --> 11:32.966
To the house?

11:32.999 --> 11:34.334
What if she's not dead?

11:34.367 --> 11:35.401
(sighs)

11:35.435 --> 11:36.670
She has to be dead.

11:36.703 --> 11:38.138
He...

11:38.171 --> 11:40.240
(sighs) He said
he wasn't sure, Claire.

11:41.007 --> 11:42.709
He said he thinks
she's dead.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.745
And what if,
for some reason, she isn't.

11:44.778 --> 11:46.680
What if she's lying there
with a broken neck,

11:46.713 --> 11:47.881
you know, paralyze
or something.

11:48.782 --> 11:51.151
Lindsay, uh, I'm not sure

11:51.184 --> 11:52.152
I could go there.

11:53.554 --> 11:54.921
I can't not go

11:54.955 --> 11:56.923
with the slightest
possibility...

11:56.957 --> 11:58.358
Well, can't you send someone,

11:58.391 --> 11:59.693
like a private detective?

12:01.267 --> 12:03.036
I'm not sure it wouldn't
violate privilege.

12:03.069 --> 12:04.170
(sighs)

12:04.204 --> 12:06.540
DOLE: Look, it's only
20 minutes from here.

12:06.573 --> 12:08.775
I would think
on something like this

12:08.809 --> 12:10.577
we should be allowed
to tell the police.

12:10.611 --> 12:12.979
Well, (sighs) you'd be wrong.

12:15.481 --> 12:16.249
Lindsay...

12:18.384 --> 12:20.921
do you want me to go
with you?

12:20.954 --> 12:22.255
Yes.

12:25.526 --> 12:27.227
That was me on the video.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.095
I was in the supermarket
that night.

12:29.129 --> 12:30.296
Did you meet Wendy Banks?

12:30.330 --> 12:31.264
RUSSELL: I did not.

12:32.132 --> 12:33.534
Nor did I ever meet

12:33.567 --> 12:35.769
Heidi Stevens
or Susan Graham.

12:35.802 --> 12:38.639
Two witnesses said
they saw you

12:38.672 --> 12:40.440
helping those women
with their cars.

12:40.473 --> 12:42.743
Those witnesses are mistaken.

12:43.309 --> 12:44.911
BERLUTI: Okay.

12:44.945 --> 12:47.013
Can you tell us
where you were

12:47.047 --> 12:48.682
on the nights
of these murders?

12:48.715 --> 12:50.584
On the evening
of October the 20th,

12:50.617 --> 12:52.018
I was working late

12:52.052 --> 12:52.953
in my office.

12:52.986 --> 12:54.755
What do you do, sir?

12:54.788 --> 12:56.422
I'm a security consultant.

12:56.456 --> 12:58.458
I basically help to detect

12:58.491 --> 12:59.960
and prevent computer fraud.

12:59.993 --> 13:01.367
Thank you.

13:01.401 --> 13:02.803
And the nights
of the other murders?

13:03.336 --> 13:04.170
I was home.

13:04.204 --> 13:05.539
Both nights?

13:05.572 --> 13:07.273
RUSSELL: Yes.
The January 3rd night,

13:07.307 --> 13:09.475
I was obviously doing
some grocery shopping

13:09.510 --> 13:10.911
in the evening,

13:10.944 --> 13:12.412
but I was home the rest
of the night.

13:12.445 --> 13:13.614
Do you live alone?

13:13.647 --> 13:14.915
No. I live with my mother.

13:14.948 --> 13:16.850
BERLUTI: Was she home
on those nights?

13:16.883 --> 13:17.918
RUSSELL: Yes, she was.

13:17.951 --> 13:19.686
And she can confirm

13:19.720 --> 13:20.587
that you were home.

13:20.621 --> 13:21.988
Yes, she can.

13:22.656 --> 13:23.690
BERLUTI: Mr. Bakey,

13:23.724 --> 13:25.859
have you ever been
arrested before?

13:25.892 --> 13:29.530
No, I have not.

13:29.563 --> 13:31.565
I am, and I
have always been,

13:32.699 --> 13:34.467
uh...

13:34.500 --> 13:36.202
a law-abiding person.

13:36.236 --> 13:38.672
I have never committed
any crime.

13:38.705 --> 13:39.773
I've never received so much

13:39.806 --> 13:40.874
as a speeding ticket.

13:42.643 --> 13:44.110
I certainly did not take

13:44.144 --> 13:46.246
the lives of three women.

13:50.551 --> 13:53.119
Not even a speeding ticket?

13:53.153 --> 13:54.555
No.

13:54.588 --> 13:56.122
Well, Mr. Bakey,
you just sound

13:56.156 --> 13:57.223
too good to be true.

13:57.257 --> 13:58.725
I would think a woman
would be lucky

13:58.759 --> 13:59.626
to snag you.

13:59.660 --> 14:00.333
YOUNG: Objection.

14:00.366 --> 14:01.535
Sustained.

14:01.568 --> 14:02.903
GAMBLE: Do you go to church?

14:02.936 --> 14:04.838
As a matter of fact, I do.

14:05.672 --> 14:07.974
GAMBLE: You even joined
the choir, didn't you?

14:08.008 --> 14:09.275
I tried out for the choir.

14:09.309 --> 14:12.779
GAMBLE: Well,
according to my sources,

14:12.813 --> 14:14.380
you didn't sing too well.

14:14.414 --> 14:15.616
There was some suspicion

14:15.649 --> 14:17.083
that you might have tried out

14:17.117 --> 14:18.819
in order to meet women.

14:18.852 --> 14:19.853
Is that true?

14:20.554 --> 14:23.456
I can't speak to the truth
of the suspicion,

14:23.489 --> 14:24.290
but that's not why
I tried out

14:24.324 --> 14:25.225
for the choir.

14:25.258 --> 14:27.193
Ever been in therapy,
Mr. Bakey?

14:27.227 --> 14:28.094
Objection.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.029
Sustained.

14:29.062 --> 14:30.096
GAMBLE: Your honor,
I'm trying to explore

14:30.130 --> 14:32.298
the psyche of a grown man

14:32.332 --> 14:34.200
who still lives at home
with his mother.

14:34.234 --> 14:35.001
YOUNG: Objection.

14:35.035 --> 14:35.669
KITTLESON: If you wanna know

14:35.702 --> 14:37.203
why he lives with his mother,

14:37.237 --> 14:39.372
ask him, but he hasn't
opened any door

14:39.405 --> 14:40.874
on character evidence.

14:40.907 --> 14:42.408
GAMBLE: Mr. Bakey,

14:42.442 --> 14:44.244
you were a bit modest

14:44.277 --> 14:45.612
in describing your job.

14:45.646 --> 14:48.649
In fact, you're a bit
of a whiz.

14:48.682 --> 14:50.416
Many companies hire you

14:50.450 --> 14:52.452
to detect computer fraud,
don't they?

14:52.485 --> 14:53.587
I've done well.

14:53.620 --> 14:57.891
You make over $200,000 a year.

14:57.924 --> 14:58.759
A talented,

14:58.792 --> 15:00.166
good-looking man

15:00.200 --> 15:02.736
who still lives
with his mother.

15:02.769 --> 15:03.870
Seems odd.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.405
Objection.
GAMBLE: Withdrawn.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.573
Mr. Bakey, is your mother

15:06.607 --> 15:08.174
physically or financially

15:08.208 --> 15:09.242
dependent on you?

15:09.275 --> 15:10.410
No.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.812
Have you ever not lived
with your mother?

15:11.845 --> 15:12.813
RUSSELL: No.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.047
I am not ashamed of loving

15:14.080 --> 15:15.448
my mother, Ms. Gamble.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.117
I enjoy living with her.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.051
We--we're very compatible.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.252
Ever had sex with her?

15:19.285 --> 15:20.286
BERLUTI: Objection!
YOUNG: Objection!

15:20.320 --> 15:22.923
GAMBLE: Trying to explore
the depth of this love

15:22.956 --> 15:23.990
and compatibility.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.059
The objection is sustained.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.762
Ever had any girlfriends,
Mr. Bakey?

15:30.731 --> 15:31.665
I date.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.800
GAMBLE: I don't mean a date
or a movie

15:33.834 --> 15:36.269
or helping a girl
change a tire...

15:36.302 --> 15:36.970
BERLUTI: Objection!
YOUNG: Objection!

15:37.003 --> 15:37.838
Ms. Gamble--

15:37.871 --> 15:39.139
I mean a relationship.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.642
Have you ever had
a long-term relationship

15:41.675 --> 15:42.442
with a woman?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.477
If so, could I have her name?

15:44.511 --> 15:46.179
Your Honor...
Overruled.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.247
He can answer that one.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.949
Any girlfriends, Mr. Bakey?

15:48.982 --> 15:50.984
I've been extremely
career-oriented.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.418
Lots of nights
at home with mom?

15:52.452 --> 15:53.620
YOUNG: Objection!

15:53.654 --> 15:54.655
Ms. Gamble, knock it off.

15:54.688 --> 15:55.922
Do you have a problem
getting along

15:55.956 --> 15:57.123
with women, Mr. Bakey?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.592
No, I do not.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.466
You kill women,
don't you, Mr. Bakey?

16:00.500 --> 16:01.535
No, I do not.

16:01.568 --> 16:04.538
GAMBLE: Two of the victims
were last seen with you.

16:04.571 --> 16:06.306
No, they were not.

16:06.339 --> 16:08.141
Your witnesses were mistaken.

16:08.174 --> 16:09.375
My witnesses
were mistaken.

16:09.409 --> 16:10.544
Well, too bad for you,
I guess,

16:10.577 --> 16:12.178
that you don't have
any witnesses

16:12.212 --> 16:14.480
other than loving mom.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.016
You have difficulties
with intimacy,

16:16.049 --> 16:17.250
don't you, Mr. Bakey?

16:17.283 --> 16:18.318
It causes you to kill women.

16:18.351 --> 16:19.252
YOUNG: Objection!

16:19.285 --> 16:20.420
KITTLESON: Sustained.

16:20.453 --> 16:23.524
Is it some sexual dysfunction

16:23.557 --> 16:25.191
that causes you to snap?

16:26.927 --> 16:29.029
I asked you a question,
Mr. Bakey.

16:29.696 --> 16:32.498
Do you have some
sexual dysfunction

16:32.533 --> 16:34.034
that caused you to snap

16:34.067 --> 16:36.402
and stab those three women?

16:40.473 --> 16:43.243
I never met those women.

16:43.276 --> 16:45.679
I never took their lives.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.315
The witnesses are mistaken,

16:49.349 --> 16:51.051
as are you, Ms. Gamble.

17:07.207 --> 17:08.509
(door closes)

17:08.541 --> 17:11.712
WYATT: This is so not why
I went to law school.

17:11.744 --> 17:14.180
DOLE: He said upstairs.

17:14.214 --> 17:15.915
I can't believe
we can't hire somebody

17:15.949 --> 17:17.718
to do this.

17:17.751 --> 17:19.252
DOLE: Because there's
something called

17:19.285 --> 17:20.554
privilege, Claire.

17:20.587 --> 17:22.255
WYATT: Yeah. Well,
privilege doesn't require us

17:22.288 --> 17:23.857
to go look at
dead bodies.

17:26.827 --> 17:28.060
DOLE: Just wait here.

17:28.094 --> 17:30.496
WYATT: Uh, right, like
I'm gonna wait anywhere alone.

17:57.090 --> 17:58.291
Oh, my God.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.074
Okay.

18:08.108 --> 18:09.976
She's dead. Let's go.

18:10.010 --> 18:11.111
DOLE: (screams)
WYATT: (screams)

18:11.144 --> 18:12.579
Why are you here?

18:12.613 --> 18:14.180
Oh, my God. Stanley...

18:14.214 --> 18:15.448
Why are you here?

18:15.481 --> 18:16.550
DOLE: Be--because
we had to confirm

18:16.583 --> 18:19.019
that she is--
she was dead.

18:19.052 --> 18:20.554
Why?

18:20.587 --> 18:21.822
DOLE: Because
if she wasn't,

18:21.855 --> 18:23.156
it would be
in your best interest

18:23.189 --> 18:23.990
to save her.

18:24.024 --> 18:25.391
You were gonna tell on me.

18:25.425 --> 18:26.927
DOLE: No, we weren't.

18:28.328 --> 18:29.262
But we needed to be sure

18:29.295 --> 18:31.497
that she wasn't suffering.

18:33.867 --> 18:36.469
I don't think
she suffered that much.

18:38.304 --> 18:39.405
Look at her.

18:46.279 --> 18:48.048
She was so beautiful.

18:50.751 --> 18:52.218
What kind of person would kill

18:52.252 --> 18:54.655
an innocent child like that?

18:55.121 --> 18:55.856
Stanley...

18:57.758 --> 18:59.793
I know you didn't want
to hurt her.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.467
And I know you desperately

19:01.502 --> 19:03.003
don't want to hurt
anybody else.

19:03.970 --> 19:06.372
Given that, maybe we should
go to the police.

19:06.406 --> 19:07.941
No.

19:07.974 --> 19:09.576
I can't go to prison.

19:10.443 --> 19:12.212
I'll go to a hospital,

19:12.646 --> 19:14.480
but not a prison.

19:14.515 --> 19:15.749
You said that before.

19:17.483 --> 19:18.885
Now, look.

19:19.553 --> 19:22.322
Because I didn't go
to a hospital.

19:22.355 --> 19:23.924
I'll go to a doctor,
Lindsay.

19:23.957 --> 19:25.158
I want to.

19:26.392 --> 19:28.428
But not prison.

19:30.130 --> 19:31.364
Not prison.

19:43.844 --> 19:45.912
BERLUTI: Your mother
goes up next,

19:45.946 --> 19:47.180
then we rest.

19:49.015 --> 19:50.016
Okay.

19:51.217 --> 19:53.887
BERLUTI: Are you all right?

19:53.920 --> 19:55.188
(sighs)

19:55.221 --> 19:58.124
Do you think (sighs)

19:58.158 --> 19:59.993
I'm aberrant for living
with my mother?

20:01.267 --> 20:02.468
Well...

20:03.970 --> 20:05.872
it's not...

20:05.906 --> 20:07.974
typical for a 30-year-old man.

20:11.011 --> 20:12.846
If you don't mind my asking,

20:14.180 --> 20:16.316
why do you still live at home?

20:16.983 --> 20:19.820
I'm hugely busy at work.

20:19.853 --> 20:21.655
It's not like I have a family

20:21.688 --> 20:24.024
or a need for my own
place yet.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.191
Well, what about a need

20:25.225 --> 20:26.727
for your independence?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.097
I suppose I...

20:31.131 --> 20:32.498
still feel safe at home.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.871
My parents were divorced

20:37.904 --> 20:39.906
when I was young.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.174
My mother,

20:41.207 --> 20:42.843
she fought all my battles.

20:44.778 --> 20:46.880
She may have undermined
my self-esteem

20:46.913 --> 20:48.582
in the process.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.852
But I guess I've always felt,

20:53.286 --> 20:55.221
I don't know, safe.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.901
I'm gonna throw something out.

21:00.934 --> 21:03.504
It's kind of wild, but...

21:03.904 --> 21:05.305
What?

21:05.338 --> 21:09.309
Well, you've described
your mother

21:09.342 --> 21:10.544
as pretty controlling.

21:12.245 --> 21:15.481
Is it possible
your mother saw you

21:15.516 --> 21:16.983
with these women,

21:17.017 --> 21:18.451
and she killed them,

21:18.484 --> 21:20.353
because, I don't know,

21:20.386 --> 21:22.055
she felt threatened or--

21:22.088 --> 21:24.658
Jimmy, I never met
these women.

21:24.691 --> 21:26.593
I was never with them.
Okay.

21:26.627 --> 21:28.729
RUSSELL: And even if
I was with them,

21:28.762 --> 21:30.964
my mother, she is not capable

21:30.997 --> 21:32.365
of committing murder.

21:32.398 --> 21:33.867
Trust me.
Like I said,

21:33.900 --> 21:35.769
it was a wild idea.

21:35.802 --> 21:36.970
(scoffs)

21:41.041 --> 21:43.009
Is she gonna go after her?

21:43.409 --> 21:44.110
Sorry?

21:44.144 --> 21:45.546
The DA is she planning

21:45.579 --> 21:46.980
to attack my mother?

21:48.649 --> 21:49.783
Probably.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.789
MARSHA (over TV): We're not
looking for a punishment.

21:55.822 --> 21:57.323
We just want
our daughter back.

21:58.124 --> 21:59.660
We're appealing
to your compassion

21:59.693 --> 22:01.367
and to your humanity.

22:01.401 --> 22:03.670
Please.

22:03.704 --> 22:05.772
Please just bring her back.

22:05.806 --> 22:06.907
DONNELL: Can you imagine?

22:08.008 --> 22:08.975
No.

22:09.009 --> 22:11.277
(sighs) How long
has she been gone?

22:11.311 --> 22:12.212
Did they say?

22:12.245 --> 22:13.680
I didn't hear.

22:13.714 --> 22:15.281
This is when I go back
to believing

22:15.315 --> 22:17.383
in the death penalty.

22:17.417 --> 22:20.486
Somebody snatches a child.

22:21.622 --> 22:22.556
Yeah.

22:26.660 --> 22:29.630
(keyboard clacking)

22:38.304 --> 22:39.039
GAMBLE: Come on.

22:39.072 --> 22:40.140
Don't stop on me now.

22:40.173 --> 22:41.942
We just had you serviced.

22:43.409 --> 22:44.578
Come on.

22:44.611 --> 22:45.846
Damn it.

22:47.413 --> 22:48.649
(sighs)

22:53.386 --> 22:54.655
(music playing)

22:57.924 --> 22:59.993
WALSH: "Those who falsely
accuse others

23:00.026 --> 23:02.468
deserve punishment
themselves.

23:03.637 --> 23:07.407
And those who would vilify
a person's mother,

23:07.440 --> 23:11.344
don't attack the mother,
dear Helen."

23:15.448 --> 23:16.416
My God.

23:16.449 --> 23:17.518
Did you send it?

23:18.619 --> 23:19.620
Me?

23:21.121 --> 23:22.188
I'm in jail.

23:22.222 --> 23:23.456
Well, you made a few calls
last night.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.592
A computer expert
could use the phone lines

23:25.626 --> 23:26.459
to send a message.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.028
That's ridiculous, Eugene.

23:28.061 --> 23:29.129
I'd have to know her address.

23:29.162 --> 23:30.230
YOUNG: Well, you might have
plucked it off

23:30.263 --> 23:31.765
some of our discovery
correspondence.

23:33.366 --> 23:34.300
Look,

23:34.334 --> 23:36.603
this is a thinly
veiled threat

23:36.637 --> 23:38.271
on a DA's life, Russell.

23:38.304 --> 23:39.139
That alone could get...

23:39.172 --> 23:40.473
I didn't send it.
Did mom?

23:40.507 --> 23:42.375
Look, I don't know
what's going on.

23:42.408 --> 23:44.377
Maybe the real killer's
playing head games,

23:44.410 --> 23:45.546
but I didn't send that.

23:45.579 --> 23:46.379
And my mother wouldn't even know

23:46.412 --> 23:47.514
how to boot up a computer,

23:47.548 --> 23:49.883
much less
hack into somebody else's.

23:49.916 --> 23:51.985
BERLUTI: It does seem
suspicious, Russell.

23:52.018 --> 23:53.620
Last night you asked me

23:53.654 --> 23:55.321
if Helen Gamble
planned to attack

23:55.355 --> 23:56.923
your mother on the stand.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.291
You used that very word,

23:58.324 --> 23:59.926
attack.

23:59.960 --> 24:00.901
A few hours later,

24:00.934 --> 24:02.803
she gets a message
using the word.

24:02.836 --> 24:04.437
RUSSELL: I promise you

24:04.470 --> 24:06.707
I had nothing to do
with this.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.709
You want me
to take a polygraph?

24:08.742 --> 24:10.877
Wheel a machine in.

24:10.911 --> 24:13.379
I have nothing to do
with this.

24:15.816 --> 24:16.850
Tell them?

24:16.883 --> 24:18.519
Only that she's dead.

24:18.552 --> 24:20.353
I'll go to prison.

24:20.386 --> 24:22.756
Stanley, listen to me.

24:24.825 --> 24:26.627
I will not say who killed her.

24:26.660 --> 24:30.864
I will not even reveal
where she is.

24:30.897 --> 24:32.999
But these parents
are suffering.

24:34.234 --> 24:35.569
They should at least
be notified

24:35.602 --> 24:38.071
that their daughter is gone.

24:38.104 --> 24:40.140
The agony of not knowing.

24:41.174 --> 24:42.042
Stanley,

24:43.844 --> 24:45.912
you have a sickness.

24:47.814 --> 24:50.483
The reason
you struggle with it so

24:50.517 --> 24:53.119
is because I think
you are a man with compassion.

24:55.522 --> 24:59.425
It is inhumane
to let these parents

24:59.459 --> 25:03.103
go day after day
after day

25:03.136 --> 25:04.037
not knowing.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.209
We will in no way
implicate you.

25:09.242 --> 25:12.045
We won't help them find her
or lead them to any evidence.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.749
DOLE: Let us spare
these people some pain, Stanley,

25:17.483 --> 25:19.419
please.

25:20.887 --> 25:23.890
You can tell the parents,
not the police.

25:23.924 --> 25:25.592
DOLE: Well, they'll just go to
the police, anyway, Stanley.

25:25.626 --> 25:27.427
It doesn't...
You can tell the parents,

25:27.460 --> 25:30.163
not the police.

25:37.337 --> 25:39.840
I can vouch for him,
physically,

25:39.873 --> 25:41.742
for two of the murders.

25:41.775 --> 25:45.178
On the third, I'll simply vouch
for his character.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.348
Let's begin with the night
of December 19th.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.983
SYLVIA: He was not only home,

25:50.016 --> 25:52.218
he was sitting
right by my side,

25:52.252 --> 25:55.121
from 8:00 P.M.
through the 11:00 news.

25:55.155 --> 25:55.989
YOUNG: You're sure?

25:56.022 --> 25:57.057
SYLVIA: Positive.

25:57.090 --> 25:59.893
We were watching
It's a Wonderful Life.

25:59.926 --> 26:03.069
It's a Christmas tradition
Russell and I have.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.271
We've been watching
it together

26:05.305 --> 26:07.574
every year going back
to his childhood.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.175
If you check
your local listings,

26:09.209 --> 26:12.445
you'll see that it
aired December 19th.

26:12.478 --> 26:14.380
Well, did he ever
leave the house?

26:14.414 --> 26:15.081
SYLVIA: Never.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.651
He used the little boys' room

26:17.684 --> 26:19.753
during a commercial break
or two,

26:19.786 --> 26:21.221
but other than that,

26:21.254 --> 26:23.256
he was right by my side.

26:23.289 --> 26:26.593
What about the evening
of January 3rd?

26:26.627 --> 26:29.129
Again, he was home.

26:29.162 --> 26:30.564
I sent him
to the market

26:30.597 --> 26:32.699
to pick up a few items,

26:32.733 --> 26:35.235
hence, you saw him
on the video.

26:35.268 --> 26:37.538
But he was home
shortly after 7:00.

26:38.605 --> 26:39.506
YOUNG: Mrs. Bakey,

26:39.540 --> 26:43.109
I would assume
you love your son very much.

26:43.143 --> 26:46.713
I've been divorced over
23 years.

26:47.781 --> 26:50.283
And my son is,
without question,

26:50.316 --> 26:53.820
my dearest
and closest loved one.

26:53.854 --> 26:56.757
Which begs
the question, um,

26:56.790 --> 26:59.693
would you lie
to spare your son

26:59.726 --> 27:01.101
a lifetime of prison?

27:02.035 --> 27:04.705
If faced with that,
I suppose I would, Mr. Young.

27:04.738 --> 27:08.008
But I'm not faced
with that today.

27:08.041 --> 27:11.444
My son was with me.

27:12.278 --> 27:13.714
He was home.

27:14.548 --> 27:15.882
The fact is

27:15.916 --> 27:19.452
my son is innocent
of the crimes

27:19.485 --> 27:21.955
he is being charged with.

27:24.124 --> 27:25.191
Thank you.

27:42.843 --> 27:44.077
Your son is the dearest

27:44.110 --> 27:46.580
and closest loved one
in your life.

27:46.613 --> 27:49.816
Is that the reason
you got divorced 23 years ago?

27:49.850 --> 27:51.885
The reason
was my husband and I

27:51.918 --> 27:53.687
were ill-suited
for marriage.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.622
Well, in the divorce complaint,

27:55.656 --> 27:57.624
your husband alleged

27:57.658 --> 27:59.192
that you sexually molested

27:59.225 --> 28:00.834
your seven-year-old
son, Russell.

28:00.867 --> 28:04.738
He alleged that
as leverage to gain custody.

28:04.771 --> 28:06.339
The charge was baseless

28:06.372 --> 28:09.910
and never considered seriously
by anybody.

28:09.943 --> 28:11.945
Did you used to sleep
with your seven-year-old son?

28:11.978 --> 28:14.948
He'd get scared at night.

28:14.981 --> 28:16.449
I'd let him in the bed.

28:16.482 --> 28:17.884
You slept in the nude?

28:17.918 --> 28:21.421
I never molested my son.

28:21.454 --> 28:24.357
It certainly would explain
a few things.

28:24.390 --> 28:26.727
If mother and son
become lovers...

28:26.760 --> 28:28.461
YOUNG: Objection.
There's no basis for that.

28:28.494 --> 28:29.896
GAMBLE: There's no basis yet,

28:29.930 --> 28:32.165
because I haven't been able
to ask the question.

28:32.198 --> 28:34.067
You need basis
for the question itself,

28:34.100 --> 28:35.335
and there is none.

28:35.368 --> 28:37.604
KITTLESON: I agree.
The objection is sustained.

28:37.638 --> 28:41.241
GAMBLE: Okay.
Then we'll just leave it at

28:42.342 --> 28:44.477
you love your son
so dearly,

28:44.511 --> 28:47.480
and by your own testimony,

28:47.514 --> 28:51.718
you would lie to spare him
a life in prison.

29:09.342 --> 29:11.044
We're looking
for Lindsay Dole.

29:12.378 --> 29:13.680
That's me.

29:15.148 --> 29:16.950
Mr. and Mrs. Burns.

29:16.983 --> 29:18.184
What information
do you have?

29:19.720 --> 29:20.453
Please sit.

29:20.486 --> 29:22.455
Please just tell us.

29:22.488 --> 29:23.524
I think we need to sit.

29:40.340 --> 29:44.277
I'm afraid my information,

29:44.310 --> 29:45.278
it isn't good.

29:49.015 --> 29:51.017
(sighs)

29:51.051 --> 29:52.418
Your daughter is dead.

29:56.557 --> 29:59.359
DOLE: A client of mine
has admitted to me

29:59.392 --> 30:02.569
that he took Cindy's life.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.940
Privilege prevents me
from telling you anything more.

30:07.574 --> 30:10.376
But to spare you further agony
of not knowing, I...

30:10.410 --> 30:12.278
(cries)

30:12.312 --> 30:15.148
I am so sorry.

30:17.751 --> 30:18.885
Is there any chance

30:18.919 --> 30:22.723
that this client
was lying to you?

30:22.756 --> 30:23.423
No.

30:26.459 --> 30:29.395
He told me where...

30:29.429 --> 30:30.496
her body was.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.867
And, uh, I went there.

30:34.868 --> 30:36.970
And it was her.

30:38.572 --> 30:40.373
And she had passed away.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.679
Where is she?

30:47.247 --> 30:48.882
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that.

30:51.518 --> 30:53.587
(sighs)

30:53.620 --> 30:54.888
How was she killed?

30:56.422 --> 30:59.059
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that either.

30:59.092 --> 31:00.466
It's privileged.

31:04.771 --> 31:07.974
(crying)

31:08.008 --> 31:09.342
Oh, God.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.645
(crying) Oh, God.

31:11.678 --> 31:12.779
(crying) Oh, my...

31:15.448 --> 31:17.117
(crying)

31:22.155 --> 31:23.056
WOMAN (over TV):
In an absolutely

31:23.089 --> 31:24.791
stunning development,

31:24.825 --> 31:26.326
the parents of Cindy Burns

31:26.359 --> 31:28.328
were told
by the killer's lawyer

31:28.361 --> 31:29.830
that Cindy has in fact
been murdered.

31:29.863 --> 31:31.932
WYATT: Please don't look at me,
Stanley.

31:31.965 --> 31:32.699
DEEKS: Why isn't, Lindsay...

31:32.733 --> 31:35.335
Please don't look at me.

31:35.368 --> 31:37.203
Lindsay is under
a microscope right now.

31:37.237 --> 31:39.339
There's a chance the police
could watch her every move,

31:39.372 --> 31:41.407
which is why you are not
to come to our office.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.010
Does this...
WYATT: Please don't talk to me.

31:44.044 --> 31:46.146
On the off chance
that I'm being watched,

31:46.179 --> 31:47.180
don't look at me.

31:48.815 --> 31:51.117
Lindsay and I got
subpoenaed this morning.

31:51.151 --> 31:52.753
The police are gonna try
to force us to talk,

31:52.786 --> 31:54.921
but you need not worry,
we won't.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.658
The main thing for you
to remember is do not call us,

31:57.691 --> 31:58.759
do not come to see us.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.266
We will contact you.

32:00.300 --> 32:01.635
Write that down
if you need to, Stanley,

32:01.668 --> 32:02.903
but don't forget it.

32:02.936 --> 32:04.437
Wait for us to contact you.

32:12.679 --> 32:14.948
(breathing heavily)

32:16.149 --> 32:18.384
YOUNG: I'm not saying
we can't win,

32:18.418 --> 32:19.686
but I'm nervous.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.521
If we could get manslaughter...

32:20.554 --> 32:21.888
No.

32:25.091 --> 32:27.794
You came off
like a strange man.

32:28.795 --> 32:32.232
Add to that two of the victims
were last seen with you.

32:32.265 --> 32:34.568
And the third--

32:34.601 --> 32:35.736
I agree with Eugene.

32:35.769 --> 32:37.838
It's a big risk.

32:37.871 --> 32:39.973
Neither of us
has a good feeling here.

32:42.108 --> 32:43.443
And they're offering
manslaughter?

32:43.476 --> 32:45.546
They haven't offered
anything yet.

32:48.649 --> 32:50.851
I need to speak
to Ms. Gamble personally.

32:54.387 --> 32:55.722
Why?
RUSSELL: I just do.

32:55.756 --> 32:56.790
I need to speak to her

32:56.823 --> 32:58.825
before I would even
consider a plea.

33:02.736 --> 33:04.505
I don't know who
put the notion of plea

33:04.538 --> 33:05.672
into your head,

33:05.706 --> 33:07.173
but if you think
I'd offer manslaughter...

33:07.207 --> 33:08.542
What can we get?

33:08.575 --> 33:10.777
Murder two.
YOUNG: Oh, come on, Helen.

33:10.811 --> 33:12.245
This could be
a straight not guilty.

33:12.278 --> 33:13.413
You've got
no forensics evidence...

33:13.446 --> 33:16.249
GAMBLE: Eugene,
I can live with an acquittal,

33:16.282 --> 33:17.851
but the politics
of letting a man

33:17.884 --> 33:19.586
we consider
to be a serial killer

33:19.620 --> 33:21.287
get off on manslaughter...

33:21.321 --> 33:22.689
I would think
the important thing

33:22.723 --> 33:24.290
would be to get him off
the street.

33:24.658 --> 33:28.128
If you brought me in here
to discuss manslaughter,

33:28.161 --> 33:29.295
talk time's over.

33:30.897 --> 33:32.498
RUSSELL: They brought you in
because I wanted to talk to you,

33:32.533 --> 33:33.233
Ms. Gamble.

33:35.401 --> 33:37.470
I want you to know
I don't blame you.

33:37.504 --> 33:39.740
If you truly believe
I'm guilty,

33:39.773 --> 33:41.908
I would expect you
to be zealous against me.

33:41.942 --> 33:43.710
I have no hard feelings.

33:43.744 --> 33:45.245
I don't care.

33:45.278 --> 33:46.880
RUSSELL: One other thing,

33:46.913 --> 33:49.583
I majored in psychology
at Northeastern.

33:50.216 --> 33:52.586
I took many courses
in criminal psychology.

33:52.619 --> 33:54.888
I wish you had taken a few,
because if you had,

33:54.921 --> 33:56.022
you'd know I'm innocent.

33:56.056 --> 33:59.560
I majored in English lit,
bummer.

33:59.593 --> 34:02.435
RUSSELL: I read and reread
that message you received.

34:03.670 --> 34:07.073
My interpretation
is that whoever sent it

34:07.107 --> 34:10.110
doesn't want me convicted.

34:10.143 --> 34:11.645
He's angry with you.

34:12.513 --> 34:14.681
Perhaps the real killer
doesn't like the attention

34:14.715 --> 34:16.783
and credit going to me.

34:16.817 --> 34:17.918
In any event,

34:17.951 --> 34:19.085
I firmly believe

34:19.119 --> 34:22.355
that if you continue
to prosecute me zealously,

34:22.388 --> 34:23.356
you will be killed.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.761
Are you threatening me,
Mr. Bakey?

34:28.360 --> 34:29.763
Me? No.

34:29.795 --> 34:32.966
(chuckling) I'm only saying
that whoever sent this,

34:32.998 --> 34:34.801
in my opinion,

34:34.835 --> 34:36.069
intends very much to kill you

34:36.101 --> 34:37.070
if you don't back off.

34:37.103 --> 34:37.804
Russell.

34:37.838 --> 34:39.139
I think she should know this.

34:39.672 --> 34:41.474
There's no shame in losing.

34:41.507 --> 34:44.409
Everybody knows
the state's case is thin.

34:44.444 --> 34:47.981
But winning
that could be deadly.

34:50.917 --> 34:53.219
Helen, would you excuse us
please?

35:02.302 --> 35:03.570
Are you out of your mind?

35:04.304 --> 35:06.306
To me the message
seemed dangerous.

35:06.339 --> 35:08.041
That's all I was saying.

35:08.074 --> 35:09.876
From my experience,

35:09.910 --> 35:11.945
women never seem
to recognize danger.

35:11.978 --> 35:13.647
What's that supposed
to mean?

35:15.682 --> 35:17.618
Prepare your closing, Eugene.

35:22.823 --> 35:25.892
FRUTT: Privilege is absolute,
Your Honor.

35:25.926 --> 35:28.962
Ms. Dole and Ms. Wyatt
learned what they learned

35:28.995 --> 35:30.531
through a confidential
communication...

35:30.564 --> 35:31.698
It doesn't matter.

35:31.732 --> 35:32.699
By going there,

35:32.733 --> 35:34.300
they became witnesses
themselves.

35:34.334 --> 35:35.702
To what?

35:35.736 --> 35:36.870
Who knows what?

35:36.903 --> 35:39.172
Possible time of death,
position of the body.

35:39.205 --> 35:41.675
The point is privilege
doesn't protect them here.

35:42.342 --> 35:44.044
Once they go to a scene,
they lose any opportunity...

35:44.077 --> 35:46.813
FRUTT: There is no basis
in law for that contention.

35:46.847 --> 35:47.981
What's more,

35:48.014 --> 35:49.983
my clients
didn't disturb the scene...

35:50.016 --> 35:51.585
But why did they go there
at all?

35:51.618 --> 35:54.487
To affirm that Cindy Burns
was in fact dead.

35:54.521 --> 35:55.889
If she were still alive,

35:55.922 --> 35:57.958
they could perhaps
help save her.

35:57.991 --> 35:59.560
And I would submit,
Your Honor,

35:59.593 --> 36:02.736
to hold that a lawyer
blows privilege

36:02.769 --> 36:04.838
by going to a scene

36:04.871 --> 36:07.874
that could have potentially
devastating effects.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.476
No lawyers would ever
go to scenes,

36:10.511 --> 36:13.514
and sometimes that would mean
lives would be lost.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.448
All right. Look...

36:15.481 --> 36:18.384
I won't make them reveal
the identity of their client,

36:18.418 --> 36:19.920
but I am ordering them

36:19.953 --> 36:21.688
to tell us
where the body is.

36:22.255 --> 36:23.924
DOLE: Your Honor,

36:23.957 --> 36:25.225
I won't do that.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.728
MANTLE: Then I'll hold you
in contempt, Ms. Dole.

36:27.761 --> 36:29.462
DOLE: If I tell you
where the body is,

36:29.495 --> 36:31.364
that could lead
to discovery of the evidence,

36:31.397 --> 36:33.199
which could lead you
to my client.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.367
MANTLE: Ms. Dole,

36:34.400 --> 36:37.237
I am giving you
a court order.

36:37.270 --> 36:39.005
Please don't think
I'm kidding.

36:40.507 --> 36:42.943
Lindsay, he's letting you
off the hook here.

36:42.976 --> 36:43.777
He's ordering you.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.812
I'm not looking
to get off a hook.

36:52.886 --> 36:56.022
This is privileged information,
and I won't reveal it.

36:57.658 --> 37:00.266
Security, take Ms. Dole
into custody.

37:11.511 --> 37:12.445
Ms. Wyatt,

37:13.346 --> 37:15.148
I am now ordering you

37:15.181 --> 37:16.716
to tell us where the body is.

37:29.495 --> 37:31.732
How long will
they keep us?

37:31.765 --> 37:33.399
Until we tell.

37:33.433 --> 37:34.400
(sighs)

37:34.434 --> 37:37.170
Or until it becomes clear
we won't.

37:40.574 --> 37:41.775
No murder weapon,

37:41.808 --> 37:43.043
no fingerprints,

37:43.076 --> 37:44.244
no DNA,

37:44.277 --> 37:45.679
no bloodstains,

37:45.712 --> 37:48.414
no forensic evidence
whatsoever.

37:49.282 --> 37:51.084
They searched my client's house,

37:51.117 --> 37:53.453
his car, every stitch
of his clothing.

37:53.486 --> 37:55.689
They couldn't find so much
as a fiber.

37:56.823 --> 37:58.291
All they have--

37:58.324 --> 38:01.935
all they have
are two witnesses

38:01.968 --> 38:03.369
who said they saw a man

38:03.403 --> 38:05.506
who looks a lot
like Russell Bakey,

38:05.539 --> 38:07.974
that, and a videotape

38:08.008 --> 38:10.977
which puts Russell Bakey
in the same supermarket

38:11.011 --> 38:12.378
as the third victim.

38:12.412 --> 38:15.982
Now, that hardly overcomes
all reasonable doubt,

38:16.016 --> 38:18.652
especially, since my client

38:19.485 --> 38:21.187
has an alibi.

38:21.221 --> 38:23.023
For two of the murders,

38:23.056 --> 38:24.891
Russell Bakey has an alibi

38:24.925 --> 38:27.528
that puts him in his home
for the night.

38:27.561 --> 38:29.262
Yes, it's his mother,

38:29.295 --> 38:32.398
and, yes, she might have
a motive to protect him.

38:32.432 --> 38:33.934
He's her son.

38:33.967 --> 38:36.903
But her testimony
stands uncontradicted,

38:36.937 --> 38:40.273
uncontroverted.

38:40.306 --> 38:42.442
His alibi

38:42.475 --> 38:44.745
has not been refuted.

38:46.813 --> 38:48.048
GAMBLE: She's his mother.

38:48.549 --> 38:50.050
She loves him dearly.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.152
We heard that, didn't we?

38:52.185 --> 38:54.921
They even live together,
don't they?

38:54.955 --> 38:59.225
They have
a very special relationship,

38:59.259 --> 39:01.334
this mother and son.

39:01.367 --> 39:04.337
Three women are dead.

39:04.370 --> 39:05.906
All three

39:05.939 --> 39:08.575
have one thing in common,

39:08.609 --> 39:09.776
Russell Bakey.

39:10.577 --> 39:12.445
Two of them
were last seen with him,

39:12.478 --> 39:15.048
the third in the same
supermarket with him.

39:15.582 --> 39:17.784
How many more coincidences
have to happen,

39:17.818 --> 39:19.019
ladies and gentlemen?

39:19.720 --> 39:22.689
Jumper cables found
in his trunk.

39:22.723 --> 39:25.959
These are tools
to help repair cars.

39:27.293 --> 39:30.263
Now, I suppose
that's a big coincidence too.

39:33.900 --> 39:37.237
This man
has serious problems

39:37.270 --> 39:38.104
with women

39:38.138 --> 39:41.107
so he kills them,

39:41.141 --> 39:42.709
slashes a tire,

39:42.743 --> 39:43.977
disconnects a battery,

39:44.010 --> 39:45.512
becomes a Good Samaritan,

39:45.546 --> 39:46.913
and then kills,

39:48.615 --> 39:52.018
with loving mom
waiting at home with an alibi.

39:53.086 --> 39:54.855
We caught him.

39:54.888 --> 39:57.057
We arrested him.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.159
We brought him to trial.

39:59.626 --> 40:01.434
Now, we give him to you.

40:01.968 --> 40:04.304
Let's not pick up
a newspaper one day

40:04.337 --> 40:08.274
and read about
yet another coincidence.

40:12.546 --> 40:13.614
FRUTT: I don't know, Bobby.
The judge

40:13.647 --> 40:15.381
just seems determined
to hold them.

40:15.415 --> 40:16.850
Great. Let's start working
on an appeal.

40:16.883 --> 40:18.451
The law has to be with us here.

40:18.484 --> 40:19.653
They have a verdict.

40:19.686 --> 40:20.521
On TV?

40:20.554 --> 40:21.555
They let cameras in.

40:21.588 --> 40:22.422
KITTLESON: Mr. Foreman,

40:22.455 --> 40:24.625
has the jury reached a verdict?

40:26.760 --> 40:27.961
We have, Your Honor.

40:27.994 --> 40:29.062
What say you?

40:30.531 --> 40:31.865
In the matter
of the Commonwealth

40:31.898 --> 40:33.634
versus Russell Bakey,

40:33.667 --> 40:35.435
on the count of murder
in the first degree,

40:36.236 --> 40:39.339
we find the defendant,
Russell Bakey,

40:39.372 --> 40:40.707
not guilty.

40:41.975 --> 40:43.309
WASHINGTON: Unbelievable.

40:43.343 --> 40:44.344
FOREMAN (over TV):
On count two,

40:44.377 --> 40:46.079
murder in the first degree,

40:46.112 --> 40:47.213
we find the defendant,

40:47.581 --> 40:48.314
not guilty.

40:48.348 --> 40:50.283
(sighs)

40:50.316 --> 40:52.619
FOREMAN: On count three,
murder in the first degree,

40:52.653 --> 40:54.254
we find the defendant,

40:54.287 --> 40:55.321
not guilty.

40:55.355 --> 40:57.558
(sighs) Thank God.

40:57.591 --> 41:00.400
KITTLESON: Members of the jury,
this concludes your service.

41:00.433 --> 41:02.168
You are dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.671
The defendant
is free to go.

41:04.705 --> 41:05.772
(gavel bangs)

41:05.806 --> 41:07.240
Thank you.

41:10.611 --> 41:13.880
Let me bring you home,
sweetheart.

41:13.914 --> 41:16.550
Your room is just as it was.

41:16.583 --> 41:18.685
I'm gonna cook you
a home-cooked meal.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.987
RUSSELL: Okay, Mom.

41:22.923 --> 41:23.690
Thanks, Jimmy.

41:24.858 --> 41:26.593
Thank you, Eugene.

41:30.330 --> 41:31.832
Excuse me.

41:34.167 --> 41:35.168
Ms. Gamble,

41:37.303 --> 41:38.371
I promise you

41:40.507 --> 41:42.008
justice has been done.

41:42.408 --> 41:44.210
Uh-huh.

41:44.244 --> 41:46.246
Also, one might think
this verdict

41:46.279 --> 41:49.650
takes you out of danger.

41:49.683 --> 41:50.917
Let's hope.

41:57.524 --> 41:59.059
YOUNG:
You will not threaten her.

41:59.860 --> 42:01.868
You will not go near her.

42:04.738 --> 42:06.940
Thanks again
for the good work, Eugene.

42:19.285 --> 42:22.222
(rocking chair creaking)

42:53.286 --> 42:55.221
(music playing)

43:18.519 --> 43:19.352
(grunts)

43:19.385 --> 43:20.821
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:20.854 --> 43:23.657
(music playing)
