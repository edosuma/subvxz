01:09.202 --> 01:12.638
<i>Looking at the farside with hope</i>

01:12.872 --> 01:16.171
<i>I have no regret.</i>

01:16.376 --> 01:20.073
<i>I will go over all barriers</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:23.738
<i>and express my life in a song,</i>

01:23.883 --> 01:30.948
<i>feeling proud of myself.</i>

01:31.224 --> 01:34.716
<i>I'm all alone, but I don't bend any rule.</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:38.523
<i>I'm with energy,</i>

01:38.731 --> 01:45.660
<i>hoping for break through.</i>

01:45.839 --> 01:49.536
<i>I am what I am.</i>

01:49.776 --> 01:53.212
<i>singing my song,</i>

01:53.313 --> 02:05.783
<i>letting the world to know all about me</i>

02:12.632 --> 02:14.122
Give me a hand here.

02:17.737 --> 02:18.533
How is he?

02:18.705 --> 02:19.603
Get him out of the water first.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.373
Gator! Gator!

02:22.308 --> 02:23.275
Gator's dead.

02:23.576 --> 02:24.770
We're in Hong Kong.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.341
When we were at sea with San Po.

02:28.581 --> 02:31.209
We had everything.

02:31.718 --> 02:35.051
Now, we're washed up here like driftwood.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.882
Who did all this to us?

02:37.957 --> 02:38.787
Dragon Ma

02:40.193 --> 02:41.683
I'll rip you into pieces.

02:41.861 --> 02:44.295
Right, let's all make a solemn oath.

02:57.810 --> 03:01.576
We're all agreed, Dragon Ma must die.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.181
Good morning, Mr Chun.

03:07.086 --> 03:10.180
This way.
Morning.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.482
Please sit inside.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.416
The usual?
Yes.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.254
Yes, thank you.

03:24.437 --> 03:25.062
The bill.

03:25.104 --> 03:25.536
Bill, please.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.167
They're prepared to go to jail.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.743
Their families will be compensated.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.505
The bill please.

03:35.281 --> 03:35.975
And the reporters?

03:36.115 --> 03:37.639
They're upstairs.

03:37.817 --> 03:38.613
We're ready when you are.

03:40.186 --> 03:40.880
Let's order some food.

03:41.821 --> 03:45.018
The stuff's upstairs, I'll get it for you.

03:45.959 --> 03:46.926
Please wait here.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.152
Help yourself.
OK.

03:50.630 --> 03:51.756
Don't move! This is a stick up!

03:51.931 --> 03:53.523
Don't move!

03:54.234 --> 03:54.996
No!

03:55.301 --> 03:58.566
My money!

04:01.441 --> 04:01.998
Don't move!

04:02.141 --> 04:02.766
Don't move!

04:05.044 --> 04:07.945
It's time to leave.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.612
Go and check.

04:15.054 --> 04:16.112
Police, hold it!

04:25.064 --> 04:25.928
Sir!

04:28.201 --> 04:28.792
Take them away.

04:28.968 --> 04:29.992
Yes, sir...
Go check out the shop.

04:31.738 --> 04:32.932
Mr Chun.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.268
Chan Jim.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.402
We're reporters.

04:36.809 --> 04:37.639
You're everywhere.

04:37.810 --> 04:38.674
We'll take a photo.

04:38.878 --> 04:39.640
Come on.

04:39.946 --> 04:40.935
Not for me.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.376
You caught the men so easily.

04:43.883 --> 04:44.815
Were you acting on a tip off?

04:44.984 --> 04:47.544
No, I was just on my beat as usual.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.051
Mr Chun, do you mind being called

04:49.222 --> 04:50.883
Lightening Chun?

04:51.057 --> 04:53.525
To tell the truth I'm very flattered.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.287
What are you charging them with?

04:55.662 --> 04:57.527
Robbery and assaulting an officer.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.928
Let's take a photo. Stand closer.
Grab his neck.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.835
Sir! The shop owner is dead.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.631
They should be charged with murder.

05:08.174 --> 05:09.266
I agree with you.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.773
What?
Bring them back.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.504
We just did what you told us!
We didn't murder him!

05:13.813 --> 05:14.438
Lock them up!

05:19.152 --> 05:19.709
Stop there.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.288
I only got $300! You promised...
No...

05:29.128 --> 05:30.288
You!

05:31.631 --> 05:33.030
They were escaping. Take away the bodies!

05:33.199 --> 05:33.790
Yes, sir...

05:36.102 --> 05:37.467
Mr Chun, over here.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.639
May I have an explanation?

05:41.908 --> 05:45.742
We all knew that Chun has been
staging his arrests.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.880
Now the public's aware of it, too.

05:48.147 --> 05:50.240
If you hadn't pushed him so much

05:50.450 --> 05:52.941
he wouldn't have had to falsify his arrests.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.019
You gave him three districts!

05:55.154 --> 05:58.385
Chun is the only Chinese policeman
who can carry a gun.

05:58.558 --> 05:59.786
I knew that would happen.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.189
I'm against them carrying weapons.

06:02.328 --> 06:04.023
Are you against paying them, too?

06:04.130 --> 06:06.997
The situation should dictate which
officer carries a weapon

06:07.767 --> 06:10.429
not the officer's nationality.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.900
And they should be paid the same, too.

06:12.638 --> 06:14.902
We'll address that another time.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.167
Let's concentrate on Chun here.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.777
He's responsible for three districts.

06:19.946 --> 06:20.970
It's not easy to sack him.

06:22.014 --> 06:23.914
We'll ease him out slowly

06:24.250 --> 06:25.911
starting with Sai Wan district.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.746
But who'll replace him?

06:27.987 --> 06:30.251
I have a man in mind.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.450
The man who carried out Project A
so successfully.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.024
Start!

06:39.599 --> 06:41.567
Turn Around!

06:47.140 --> 06:49.199
Left.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.145
Attention!

07:02.388 --> 07:03.286
Take them back!

07:03.389 --> 07:04.117
Yes, sir...

07:05.792 --> 07:07.919
Fall in.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.653
Sir, but I'm not qualified.

07:11.964 --> 07:15.092
No one knows that and it's worth a try.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.966
It'll be a change of scenery for you.

07:18.137 --> 07:18.796
Yes, sir...

07:19.806 --> 07:20.568
Go.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.703
This is for your outstanding service.

07:29.081 --> 07:29.706
Congratulations!

07:30.149 --> 07:30.877
Thank you, sir.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.246
Thank you, sir.

07:34.153 --> 07:34.710
Thank you.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.651
We'd also like to relieve you

07:36.823 --> 07:38.620
of some pressure.

07:39.091 --> 07:40.023
That's not necessary.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.991
We don't want our top officer overburdened.

07:43.262 --> 07:43.660
Yes.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.058
So we're handing over one of

07:46.265 --> 07:47.994
your districts to a new man.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.393
We've received some new guns.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.127
Your gun's been in service a long time.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.966
I want to have it checked.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.941
See if you need a new one.

07:56.108 --> 07:56.802
Yes, sir...

08:04.183 --> 08:05.377
Reporting for duty, sir.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.553
Dragon, now you're Chun's assistant

08:08.821 --> 08:09.879
in Sai Wan district.

08:10.089 --> 08:11.078
These are your official orders.

08:14.060 --> 08:14.992
Thank you, sir.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.926
From now on, you and Chun
will work together.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.793
If you've got any questions, ask him.

08:21.934 --> 08:22.662
Yes, sir

08:23.236 --> 08:24.669
It's an honour to work with you.

08:25.037 --> 08:29.997
Welcome, I'm quite sure you'll be
a valuable addition to the district.

08:30.142 --> 08:30.904
Let me know if you need anything.

08:31.010 --> 08:31.772
Thank you sir.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.113
Chun, you may have lost one district

08:35.248 --> 08:37.477
but the Commissioner

08:37.650 --> 08:39.948
will see you gain another.

08:40.152 --> 08:40.914
Really?

08:41.153 --> 08:41.914
Tai Hou Wan, a developing area.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.783
I see. I see.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.503
The corrupt Manchurian Government

09:01.641 --> 09:03.905
has made our country poor.

09:04.076 --> 09:07.204
We have become an inferior race.

09:07.647 --> 09:11.674
If we want to save China, we have to
have the right attitude.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.486
To enjoy a decent standard of living

09:14.687 --> 09:16.951
we have to overthrow the Government.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.023
<i>Dr Sun set up the ''Revive China Society''</i>

09:19.258 --> 09:21.920
to support the revolution.

09:22.295 --> 09:26.163
China cannot be saved by speeches alone we need action.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.496
We need weapons and the money to buy them.

09:29.669 --> 09:30.397
Police.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.471
Thank you for listening.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.003
Would you like to buy a flower?

09:34.340 --> 09:35.068
Let's go.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.305
Maggie!

09:43.015 --> 09:43.845
Regina!

09:44.350 --> 09:45.180
Stop here.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.746
Where have you been?

09:46.886 --> 09:48.683
Were you looking for me?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.218
Not really. Where are you going?

09:50.356 --> 09:50.981
Sai Wan.

09:51.257 --> 09:51.814
Hop in.

09:51.924 --> 09:52.618
Ok.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.216
My cousin, Carina

09:56.495 --> 09:57.427
my classmate, Regina.

09:57.797 --> 09:58.525
Haven't seen you before.

09:58.731 --> 09:59.629
She's just arrived from the mainland.

09:59.799 --> 10:00.356
Really?

10:04.804 --> 10:06.601
I'm having a party next week.

10:06.806 --> 10:07.431
You're invited.

10:07.573 --> 10:10.371
Is it your birthday party?
They're always such fun.

10:10.810 --> 10:11.777
Carina, please come too!

10:11.911 --> 10:12.878
Will you come?

10:13.012 --> 10:13.740
What will I wear?

10:13.980 --> 10:14.605
She'll lend you something.

10:14.780 --> 10:15.838
Sure.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.713
Support the revolution and buy a flower.

10:19.885 --> 10:20.544
No, thank you.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.152
Can I have one?

10:23.956 --> 10:26.652
If he wants to save China, give me one, too.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.156
OK.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.486
Good idea. I'll have one, too.

10:28.794 --> 10:29.419
Thank you, sirs.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.628
You're right. I'll have one, too.

10:33.933 --> 10:34.695
How much?

10:35.001 --> 10:37.299
Sir, the revolution will succeed

10:37.536 --> 10:38.503
if everyone was like you.

10:38.671 --> 10:39.365
Yes.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.338
Thank you.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.583
Where do you usually sell these?

10:51.751 --> 10:53.446
Wherever there are people to buy them.

10:55.721 --> 10:56.983
Come on, eat.

10:59.558 --> 11:00.024
What is it?

11:00.192 --> 11:01.682
The police, hide the boxes.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.290
You're spreading rumours disturbing the peace

11:10.436 --> 11:12.165
and racketeering, right?

11:13.773 --> 11:14.705
You have no proof.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.339
The flowers you have are the proof.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.543
And look at the flowers you sold.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.779
You men are my witnesses.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.843
Did this woman sell you the flowers?

11:27.053 --> 11:27.781
No.

11:29.689 --> 11:34.456
What's that?! What the hell are you doing
with flowers in your jackets?

11:34.660 --> 11:36.821
We're pen pals meeting for the first time

11:36.996 --> 11:39.157
and as we don't know each other

11:39.331 --> 11:40.923
the girls said they'd hold baskets

11:41.133 --> 11:42.600
and we said we'd wear a rose.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.696
We didn't see you there! You should
hold them higher.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.464
Come on, sit down.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.308
You look much prettier than your
handwriting.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.575
Let me introduce everyone

11:52.945 --> 11:54.173
Mr A. I'm Mr B.

11:54.346 --> 11:55.370
Mr C. Mr D. Sit down.

11:55.514 --> 11:56.412
Sit.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.945
Is it an offence to meet pen pals?

12:01.987 --> 12:04.353
I must admit you won this time.

12:04.523 --> 12:08.619
Watch out. Don't let me catch you
selling flowers.

12:08.794 --> 12:11.354
And we're not used to making
idle threats either.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.163
Some tea, miss?

12:17.470 --> 12:20.633
I hate those who oppress us on behalf of
their foreign masters.

12:20.806 --> 12:23.604
Right. They think they're wonderful
under that uniform.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.604
They're morons. Don't you agree?

12:26.178 --> 12:27.008
Not really.

12:27.179 --> 12:30.148
There are cops who are honest
and hardworking.

12:30.349 --> 12:31.441
I've never met any.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.175
Yes, you have!

12:34.353 --> 12:36.048
We're all policemen. We've never
oppressed anyone.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.686
So all of you are policemen.

12:41.260 --> 12:41.919
Excuse us.

12:43.462 --> 12:47.694
Miss, China depends on patriots like you.

12:47.967 --> 12:48.956
Don't forget your money boxes.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.608
Dragon, if they weren't so beautiful

13:03.783 --> 13:05.410
do you think you'd have helped them?

13:06.385 --> 13:07.215
Cheque, waiter.

13:07.386 --> 13:08.114
Yes, sir.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.549
Those policemen were really kind.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.783
If it wasn't for them, we'd have been
in trouble.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.288
There aren't any good policemen.

13:17.563 --> 13:18.791
How many did you sell?

13:18.964 --> 13:19.953
Quite a few.

13:21.000 --> 13:21.989
It's your lucky day.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.564
And you?

13:23.702 --> 13:24.498
Not much.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.166
Help!

13:28.340 --> 13:30.604
Help!

13:51.096 --> 13:52.358
Come back!

14:02.107 --> 14:03.301
So it's you again.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.275
What's happened?

14:05.611 --> 14:07.670
They tried to rob those ladies.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.144
Come on, make way.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.843
Really? What ladies?

14:15.020 --> 14:17.454
Make way. Come on.

14:17.723 --> 14:18.690
Don't block our way. Move along.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.156
Strange, where did they go?

14:21.627 --> 14:22.559
Officer, what's up?

14:22.695 --> 14:23.627
Nothing.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.228
Bring them back to the station!

14:25.331 --> 14:27.799
You can tell me what this is all about.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.464
I'd like to see the man in charge.

14:29.635 --> 14:30.624
He's talking.

14:30.769 --> 14:31.360
Sir

14:31.570 --> 14:32.195
What?

14:34.640 --> 14:35.732
We work for Tiger.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.705
That's right.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.202
Still, that's no excuse.
That's right.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.106
But we didn't rob those ladies.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.908
Really? How did you know they were ladies?

14:44.083 --> 14:45.448
Be quiet! Who asked you?

14:45.985 --> 14:46.917
Look, is Sergeant Chi here?

14:47.086 --> 14:47.780
Sergeant Chi?

14:48.354 --> 14:50.822
You lost. Do I place the same bet again?

14:51.123 --> 14:52.090
Make it a dollar.

14:52.224 --> 14:52.849
Really?

14:52.992 --> 14:56.519
Yeah. Wait, they want to see Sergeant Chi.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.158
This way.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.629
Right, you lot, sign here.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.762
You shouldn't be messing things up like that!

15:05.971 --> 15:07.029
We didn't, sir.

15:07.339 --> 15:08.363
Bullshit.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.499
201, show these two out.

15:11.911 --> 15:12.775
Get out of here.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.376
Can I speak now?

15:20.552 --> 15:22.213
What do you want to say? Go ahead.

15:22.388 --> 15:23.514
I want to see your superior.

15:23.689 --> 15:24.678
Why?

15:25.724 --> 15:28.124
I want to report some police irregularities.

15:28.727 --> 15:29.523
Ok.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.525
All right. Shang, take them
to the back room.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.162
Wait! One at a time.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.327
You come with me.

15:39.138 --> 15:39.832
Sung!

15:41.040 --> 15:41.802
Coming.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.412
So where is he?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.915
Our superior is right here.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.050
Now what's this about police
irregularities?

15:53.552 --> 15:54.541
You can tell him.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.055
You didn't expect your little show

15:58.290 --> 15:59.552
earlier today would go unpunished?

16:00.326 --> 16:01.293
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

16:15.908 --> 16:16.932
No, help me.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.039
Don't. Don't do that.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.573
Don't.

16:23.983 --> 16:24.677
Don't.

16:38.130 --> 16:41.031
Don't do that. Stay right there. I'm the
new superintendent for Sai Wan.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.425
Here's my appointment.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.004
Superintendent, a terrible mistake.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.143
If police officers believe
they can use their power

16:52.311 --> 16:53.972
for personal attacks

16:54.113 --> 16:56.707
and use their position to protect criminals...

16:57.983 --> 16:59.143
that's also a mistake.

16:59.318 --> 17:02.446
Sir, you mustn't believe that.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.154
I just saw it with my own eyes.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.586
Who do you think you are?

17:09.962 --> 17:11.054
If this is the way it's going to bethen I'm quitting.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.127
Right, you can do all our jobs.

17:13.898 --> 17:16.196
So you've never made a mistake?

17:16.335 --> 17:18.064
You really want everyone here to quit?

17:18.404 --> 17:20.133
All right, I quit!

17:20.672 --> 17:22.367
What has got into you boys?

17:22.540 --> 17:24.008
He's saying it's for your own good.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.634
Please, don't take any notice of them.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.741
If every officer does his duty

17:28.847 --> 17:30.439
then I'll ignore what happened.

17:30.949 --> 17:32.473
It's dawn now.

17:32.785 --> 17:33.809
Attention!

17:34.620 --> 17:36.144
Welcome, Superintendent Ma!

17:36.989 --> 17:39.355
A little welcome present for you, sir.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.851
From all the boys?

17:41.026 --> 17:42.084
Yes, sir.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.060
So Sai Wan is a good place to make money.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.959
Just to show our appreciation.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.662
But there's one constable who refused to
show his appreciation.

17:54.073 --> 17:54.937
Who's that?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.606
Constable Ho, he's still out on the beat.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.370
Send him in when he returns.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.741
Yes, sir. Let me know if you need anything.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.676
All right.

18:05.484 --> 18:08.009
Sir, that's a lovely flower you have.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.088
Thank you.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.826
Look. He's been on the wanted list
for three years!

18:22.034 --> 18:24.002
He's the suspect for many recent cases.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.833
He still lives in Sai Wan.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.371
He's down as a suspect here.

18:27.539 --> 18:30.633
So why haven't they arrested him?
Maybe they didn't want to.

18:32.711 --> 18:35.578
Superintendent. Constable Ho, sir.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.942
You didn't contribute. Why?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.517
As I don't take bribes.
I couldn't afford to.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.743
So the others take bribes, then?

18:43.088 --> 18:43.816
I didn't say that.

18:44.022 --> 18:46.718
If you don't wise up, you won't stay in
your job long.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.487
My job is to serve the people and
uphold the law.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.959
I'd rather quit than accept bribes.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.524
You sound like an honest man.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.727
Tell me about all these unsolved

18:58.937 --> 18:59.904
cases where no one's been arrested.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.336
Tiger Au's the kingpin around here.

19:02.674 --> 19:03.971
I'd love to arrest him.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.569
But I don't have the power.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.307
He's got lots of guards.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.142
These criminals are his men.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.045
So where does he hang around?

19:12.217 --> 19:14.708
He runs most of the illegal businesses
in Sai Wan.

19:15.053 --> 19:17.351
He's usually at Po Luk Hotel.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.616
Tell the other officers to come in
early tomorrow.

19:19.791 --> 19:20.382
Yes, sir

19:23.128 --> 19:24.186
Attention!

19:27.833 --> 19:30.063
All right, as long as each of you
does your duty

19:30.235 --> 19:31.202
I'll be happy.

19:31.537 --> 19:32.765
I don't need envelopes.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.233
Would you like to live near a brothel?

19:37.843 --> 19:42.041
Or see your own children gamble
or smoke opium

19:42.247 --> 19:44.579
knowing the damage they do to the family?

19:44.716 --> 19:48.208
You wouldn't like it and neither
would Sai Wan residents.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.914
But brothels, gambling and opium dens
exist everywhere

19:51.990 --> 19:53.617
and you all know who owns them.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.758
It is our duty to protect this community
and I intend to do it.

19:56.895 --> 19:57.987
Therefore starting today

19:58.130 --> 20:00.155
we're going to clean it up.

20:00.432 --> 20:01.091
Yes, sir...

20:01.333 --> 20:02.322
Attention!

20:03.468 --> 20:04.059
Let's go.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.096
Superintendent, if you've enough men

20:07.339 --> 20:08.271
I'll stay here.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.173
Can I have a day off?

20:11.410 --> 20:12.069
Why?

20:12.377 --> 20:13.139
Can I have a day off, too?

20:14.146 --> 20:15.807
Tell me why. One by one.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.178
My wife's pregnant.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.179
My sister's pregnant.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.146
What a coincidence!

20:20.285 --> 20:22.310
My sister is his wife.

20:22.654 --> 20:23.643
My wife is his sister.

20:23.755 --> 20:24.346
Yeah.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.150
Sir, can I resign now?

20:27.392 --> 20:28.086
For what reason?

20:28.293 --> 20:29.282
I'm the only child in my family.

20:29.494 --> 20:30.756
So I'd rather not go.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.052
You go yourself.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.724
Me, too.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.262
For what I'm paid, it isn't worth the risk so I quit.

20:36.935 --> 20:37.731
I quit, too.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.068
Me, as well.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.503
I quit, too.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.836
All right, operation cancelled.

20:45.711 --> 20:46.541
Dismissed.

20:54.820 --> 20:55.718
But Dragon...

20:58.323 --> 20:59.290
Come on.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.021
Now you see why I'm so fed up.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.757
They never want to do any real work.

21:09.468 --> 21:10.935
They made Dragon cancel his plan.

21:11.103 --> 21:11.797
What do you mean?

21:11.970 --> 21:14.461
There are good reasons for that.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.698
Maybe he wants someone

21:16.875 --> 21:18.433
to check Tiger out first.

21:18.577 --> 21:21.478
No. He's testing the men to see

21:21.580 --> 21:24.674
who's brave and who's a coward.

21:24.716 --> 21:27.412
Now he knows he can't trust anyone.
Am I right?

21:27.586 --> 21:29.349
He's right. We've been with Dragon
so long now

21:29.521 --> 21:31.011
we know how his mind works.

21:31.823 --> 21:35.020
Oh, really? Right now it's not working.

21:35.427 --> 21:38.089
Are you kidding?!

21:38.263 --> 21:40.629
If this operation fails, we'll have to
leave this place.

21:40.832 --> 21:43.494
He's right. We can't fail or
we're finished.

21:44.569 --> 21:47.129
Mars, I want you to take a note
to the marines.

21:47.272 --> 21:48.000
Yes.

21:48.507 --> 21:49.804
You're asking for a transfer back?!

21:49.975 --> 21:51.806
We'll go and arrest Tiger tonight.

21:54.046 --> 21:54.808
Yes, sir.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.374
Well, it's been ages since we were
all together.

21:58.817 --> 21:59.647
To your health.

22:03.722 --> 22:06.054
Tiger, I hear you have a small job
for us.

22:06.191 --> 22:08.819
That's right. I just met Chun.

22:08.994 --> 22:13.226
His Sai Wan district has been given to
some new upstart.

22:14.466 --> 22:15.490
We'll wait for Mars here.

22:15.701 --> 22:16.861
You go check the place out.

22:23.175 --> 22:23.800
Thank you.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.344
We've changed clothes

22:29.481 --> 22:30.448
why are they staring?

22:30.682 --> 22:31.944
Your hat's on backwards.

22:33.618 --> 22:34.277
How about now?

22:34.386 --> 22:35.216
That will do.

22:35.454 --> 22:36.045
What's this for?

22:36.188 --> 22:36.813
Here.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.852
Forget that. Let's get something
to eat first.

22:40.726 --> 22:43.627
Tiger, if we've lost Chun's protection

22:43.762 --> 22:45.730
who'll look after our interests?

22:45.931 --> 22:47.558
Since he's asking for a favour

22:48.266 --> 22:50.359
we have to help him no matter what.

22:52.337 --> 22:54.202
As soon as this new guy

22:54.373 --> 22:57.206
shows his face around these parts
we'll fix him permanently.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.943
Why wait for him to come out?

23:03.014 --> 23:04.345
Go fix him at the station.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.308
Who is he anyway? Is he some kind of
monster or what?

23:08.420 --> 23:09.682
Mars, over here.

23:13.825 --> 23:15.816
I spoke to Ying.

23:15.994 --> 23:16.824
She said the marines were
off training somewhere.

23:17.963 --> 23:20.056
Is the operation still on?

23:20.232 --> 23:21.199
We'll do it on our own.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.630
We can't back down now.

23:57.702 --> 23:58.930
Not much happening.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.236
What did you say his name was?

24:02.808 --> 24:03.706
Dragon Ma.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.076
Dragon Ma?

24:05.310 --> 24:07.801
Remember the one that killed
the pirates?

24:58.163 --> 24:59.630
Which one of you is Tiger?

25:00.232 --> 25:01.028
I am.

25:01.566 --> 25:04.364
In that case, you're coming down
to the station.

25:05.036 --> 25:06.901
To the station? Who are you?

25:07.105 --> 25:08.572
Superintendent Dragon Ma.

25:10.308 --> 25:13.243
You're wanted in connection
with 3 murders. 4 robberies.

25:13.411 --> 25:16.471
one case of arson and 3 of assault.

25:16.815 --> 25:17.804
This is the warrant.

25:18.884 --> 25:20.215
I did all those things?

25:21.052 --> 25:21.746
Let me see that.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.157
Sorry, I missed.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.230
Dragon, are we leaving?

25:38.837 --> 25:39.599
Stop the music.

25:40.672 --> 25:41.536
Stop it.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.401
All right, we're police officers.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.972
If you've no business here, out!

25:46.344 --> 25:47.538
Time to go.

25:47.679 --> 25:48.611
Come on, everybody.

25:48.813 --> 25:50.405
Come on.

25:52.751 --> 25:53.945
Dragon Ma.

25:59.157 --> 26:02.649
Nice of you to drop by.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.529
I wanted to meet you.

26:06.698 --> 26:07.995
You must be after me.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.691
Those two Causeway Bay murders I did both of them.

26:15.874 --> 26:17.466
You'd better arrest me, too, because

26:17.609 --> 26:19.600
I'm going to kill a policeman soon.

26:20.412 --> 26:24.678
Dragon Ma, didn't anyone tell you?
You're dead.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.983
One day I'll die for sure like
everybody else.

26:28.787 --> 26:31.449
In the meantime, you're under arrest.

26:45.070 --> 26:45.798
Dragon!

26:50.542 --> 26:52.772
Dragon! The third unit are outside

26:52.911 --> 26:53.935
awaiting orders.

26:54.679 --> 26:55.509
Dragon!

26:57.582 --> 27:00.210
The other two units are all in position.
All ready.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.116
No one told me about this.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.048
What?

27:03.221 --> 27:05.485
Don't just stand there. Get them in here.

27:05.890 --> 27:06.720
Go.

27:06.891 --> 27:07.585
Yes.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.621
I'll tell them to charge.

27:12.397 --> 27:13.694
They're all ready.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.467
Forget it. No more bluffing

27:16.601 --> 27:18.660
we're all alone.

27:19.671 --> 27:20.729
You've got courage.

27:24.209 --> 27:26.769
You shouldn't be worried about
arresting anyone

27:27.312 --> 27:29.837
You should be more worried about
getting out of here alive

27:33.718 --> 27:34.207
The doors.

27:34.386 --> 27:34.909
Right.

27:37.756 --> 27:38.586
Steady.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.654
Steady.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.226
Get out of here!

27:44.729 --> 27:45.787
Steady.

27:47.766 --> 27:48.664
What do we do now?

27:48.967 --> 27:49.991
Now...

27:51.403 --> 27:53.234
Get them!

28:02.781 --> 28:03.440
Look out!

28:27.038 --> 28:27.527
The back!

28:49.260 --> 28:52.627
Bastard! Let me teach you a good lesson.

29:51.689 --> 29:55.250
Arrest me?!

29:55.894 --> 29:57.020
You'd need more lives than a cat
to arrest me.

30:04.169 --> 30:05.363
You four kneel down.

30:05.937 --> 30:06.835
Go get him!

30:45.376 --> 30:46.775
Had enough yet?

30:47.879 --> 30:49.540
Don't forget my name is Wong.

31:04.128 --> 31:05.686
Forward!

31:24.482 --> 31:26.643
Upright!

31:27.819 --> 31:28.786
Spread out!

31:31.022 --> 31:33.286
Dragon, are you all right?

31:34.525 --> 31:35.583
Upright!

31:36.361 --> 31:39.660
Dragon, what a surprise! I see you're
hard at work.

31:40.164 --> 31:40.823
Yes, sir...

31:40.965 --> 31:41.932
How's it going?

31:43.034 --> 31:46.094
They were resisting arrest.

31:46.271 --> 31:50.264
Really? I see, take them away.

31:50.475 --> 31:51.169
Hold it.

31:51.542 --> 31:55.911
What? Are we pirates? Are we smugglers?

31:56.281 --> 31:58.272
This is dry land, you can't
arrest us here!

31:58.883 --> 32:00.612
I realise that, sir.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.686
But I suspect there are pirates
in this hotel.

32:03.187 --> 32:07.419
Superintendent, please carry on I wouldn't want to interrupt you.

32:07.892 --> 32:08.688
Yes, sir.

32:10.061 --> 32:10.993
Lock them up.

32:11.162 --> 32:11.924
Yes, sir.

32:14.632 --> 32:18.193
Round them up, take them back to the base

32:18.369 --> 32:21.099
and question them to see if they are pirates.

32:21.472 --> 32:22.234
Yes, sir...

32:22.740 --> 32:26.107
You. You. Round them up.
Take them back to the base!

32:27.011 --> 32:27.807
Fall in.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.044
Yes, sir...

32:30.815 --> 32:33.306
Right. Go.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.241
Quick.

32:37.922 --> 32:39.082
Take them away.

32:39.590 --> 32:40.682
Are you all right?

32:40.825 --> 32:42.087
You could have come quicker.

32:42.193 --> 32:42.852
Move it.

32:42.994 --> 32:43.926
Come on.

32:44.195 --> 32:45.628
Thank you. I owe you one.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.060
They were out at sea.

32:47.231 --> 32:49.358
They came as soon as they got
the message.

32:50.401 --> 32:53.097
Dragon Ma! If it wasn't...

32:53.271 --> 32:54.067
Shut up!

32:54.572 --> 32:55.300
Hold it!

32:58.042 --> 32:59.066
Release these two.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.239
If you two manage to walk out of
this place

33:04.415 --> 33:05.347
you can go free.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.342
Right, leave us.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.427
Lock them up!

34:40.710 --> 34:42.178
You're still the same.

34:43.081 --> 34:43.978
Sorry, sir.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.942
If police work was that easy

34:47.085 --> 34:48.279
I'd have taken your job long ago.

34:48.453 --> 34:49.181
I know, sir.

34:50.455 --> 34:53.083
Just remember, you're still one of us.

34:53.224 --> 34:54.782
We must go fishing again.

34:54.992 --> 34:55.719
Yes, sir...

34:56.994 --> 34:59.963
Dragon, Father says things are
very different on land

35:00.064 --> 35:01.053
especially here.

35:01.232 --> 35:02.790
You have to be careful.

35:04.469 --> 35:05.367
Take them back to the station.

35:05.470 --> 35:06.129
Yes, sir...

35:06.537 --> 35:08.402
Move it! Go on!

35:12.043 --> 35:12.668
How was it?

35:12.810 --> 35:14.209
It's Dragon Ma for sure.
Yes.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.776
Let's kill him!
Let's do it.

35:16.247 --> 35:17.236
How?

35:17.348 --> 35:18.406
They've got an entire army out there.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.774
The police were looking for pirates.

35:21.119 --> 35:21.778
Right?

35:21.986 --> 35:23.954
See? They've already got wind
of our plan.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.054
What do we do now?

35:25.189 --> 35:25.917
We can go to bed early.

35:26.090 --> 35:26.852
Where do we sleep?

35:27.058 --> 35:28.218
Where do we sleep?

35:29.093 --> 35:31.459
We can't kill him now, so we'll
find a hotel.

35:31.929 --> 35:32.827
We have to wait.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.463
You're here.
Yes.

35:35.666 --> 35:36.963
Cigarette?
No, thanks.

35:37.101 --> 35:38.830
Chun, are you taking those files?

35:39.036 --> 35:39.968
I was going to.

35:40.238 --> 35:41.330
But I'll need them when I'm back.

35:41.506 --> 35:42.336
Really?

35:42.507 --> 35:43.974
When will you be back?

35:44.108 --> 35:45.370
I believe it will be soon.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.769
Not everyone can sit in this chair.

35:47.912 --> 35:49.277
You're right, sir.

35:49.780 --> 35:50.838
Find a place to store them.

35:51.015 --> 35:52.243
He'll be back soon.

35:52.416 --> 35:53.246
Right.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.052
Sergeant, could you...?

36:13.070 --> 36:16.870
Dragon Ma! I've always wanted to arrest
these gangsters

36:17.108 --> 36:17.870
and now you've done it.

36:18.075 --> 36:19.099
This is terrific.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.470
It's the right choice to choose you.

36:20.611 --> 36:21.407
Thanks.

36:21.579 --> 36:22.341
Shut up!

36:22.480 --> 36:23.447
What do you mean?

36:23.548 --> 36:24.207
Lock them up.

36:24.382 --> 36:25.349
You've changed your tune.

36:25.483 --> 36:26.245
Take them away.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.977
Chun!
Shut up!

36:29.086 --> 36:30.678
Do you hear me?! Take them away!

36:32.256 --> 36:34.019
Do you hear me?! Take them away!

36:41.065 --> 36:42.362
Upright!

36:46.571 --> 36:48.198
Put Tiger in the security block.

36:48.472 --> 36:49.097
Yes, sir...

36:49.240 --> 36:50.764
267. 357
Sir

36:50.975 --> 36:52.636
Put Wong here in cell two.

36:52.777 --> 36:53.607
Yes, sir...

36:54.078 --> 36:56.706
282, take some men and seal off
the hotel.

36:56.847 --> 36:57.472
Yes, sir...

36:57.915 --> 36:58.404
Sergeant Ching.

36:58.783 --> 36:59.545
Sir

36:59.850 --> 37:01.044
Lock up the rest of this rabble

37:01.185 --> 37:02.379
and take their statements.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.482
Yes, sir...

37:03.721 --> 37:05.951
The rest start working on the wanted criminals.

37:06.123 --> 37:06.646
Understood?

37:06.958 --> 37:07.617
Yes, sir...

37:08.693 --> 37:09.421
Get to work.

37:09.627 --> 37:10.457
Yes, sir...

37:11.095 --> 37:11.959
Get going!

37:15.566 --> 37:20.026
You've been working very hard.
Take a break.

37:20.271 --> 37:21.260
Thank you sir

37:22.840 --> 37:25.274
Sir, you put your feet up.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.968
I'll make you a nice cup of coffee.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.647
These files, where do I put them?

37:30.915 --> 37:32.576
Idiot! Put them away.

37:39.223 --> 37:43.523
Dragon, the Commissioner is extremely
pleased with the way the raid went.

37:43.661 --> 37:44.286
Thank you sir

37:44.829 --> 37:45.887
Don't thank me.

37:46.230 --> 37:48.323
And we can't give you any medals yet.

37:48.966 --> 37:51.059
Remember, don't get carried away.

37:51.535 --> 37:52.502
No. I won't, sir.

37:52.703 --> 37:54.261
I'm here to make sure you don't.

37:54.905 --> 37:55.735
Yes, sir...

37:56.841 --> 38:00.607
Keep your eyes peeled at the
Commissioner's daughter's party.

38:00.778 --> 38:01.642
I'll be on the alert.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.073
That's not good enough.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.774
You must anticipate Chun's every move
to cause trouble.

38:09.153 --> 38:12.384
If anything goes wrong, you'll be blamed.

38:12.790 --> 38:13.779
Thanks for the advice, sir.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.623
You'd better get something smart
to wear.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.653
You and your men need new clothes.

38:19.997 --> 38:20.861
This ought to cover things.

38:21.632 --> 38:22.621
Thank you, sir

38:34.312 --> 38:36.303
This rat won't even feed one of us.

38:38.716 --> 38:39.307
Where are you going?

38:39.483 --> 38:41.474
To rob a shop.

38:41.519 --> 38:42.850
I want to eat proper food, not rats.

38:43.154 --> 38:43.916
We've got nothing to lose.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.311
That's true.

38:45.523 --> 38:47.616
But we've come to kill Ma.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.859
If we go out, we'll be arrested
in a matter of minutes.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.826
then we'll never avenge the death
of our captain.

38:57.435 --> 38:59.198
Shall I make rat soup?

38:59.603 --> 39:01.400
I haven't eaten meat soup for ages.

39:06.243 --> 39:08.609
Guys, I've talked to Chun.

39:08.879 --> 39:12.474
I've agreed to steal a necklace
at the birthday party.

39:12.650 --> 39:13.514
I don't get it.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.713
We're not doing this for Chun.

39:16.921 --> 39:20.322
We are doing this for the revolution.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.289
He'll pay good money and we can
use it for weapons.

39:23.561 --> 39:25.529
Does Chun know your background?

39:25.696 --> 39:28.688
He knows I smuggle weapons.

39:28.899 --> 39:30.093
But he thinks I'm a thief.

39:30.601 --> 39:32.865
That's great. I think we should
give it a try.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.301
By the way, before I left Canton

39:35.473 --> 39:37.031
Dr Sun gave me a warning.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.574
After the murder of the
governor of Canton

39:39.744 --> 39:42.872
the dowager empress sent secret agents
to arrest us.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.741
Tell Maggie and Carina to be careful
selling flowers.

39:47.752 --> 39:48.548
Dismissed.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.050
Come with me.

39:54.358 --> 39:55.222
I found it.

39:55.359 --> 39:55.984
What did you find?

39:56.260 --> 39:56.817
Fish and lobster.

39:56.994 --> 39:57.926
Really?

39:58.229 --> 39:59.196
It's a lobster's shell.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.056
Only the shell.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.722
Well, that's ok.

40:28.859 --> 40:29.826
What did you find out?

40:30.161 --> 40:34.257
Normally...they're spread out
all over the city.

40:34.398 --> 40:36.559
It's hard to know where they are.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.134
But Carina's often seen around here

40:39.303 --> 40:40.531
when she sells flowers.

40:40.738 --> 40:42.069
We could start with her.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.475
This time we must liquidate all of them.

40:47.077 --> 40:48.305
Yes, sir...

40:50.848 --> 40:51.746
It's beautiful!

40:53.250 --> 40:54.808
I feel stupid dressed like this.

40:55.486 --> 40:56.248
Don't be silly.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.216
But I do.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.120
We'll change inside.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.388
It's Mr B.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.637
The invitation's for one person only.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.400
It says here one person.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.470
But can't she come with me, please?

41:21.212 --> 41:23.203
Sure. I don't think that will be
a problem.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.616
Maggie. You finally turned up.

41:26.917 --> 41:27.645
You're late.

41:27.852 --> 41:30.480
We've been waiting you for long.
Come on!

41:32.523 --> 41:34.115
Why are you late?

41:34.492 --> 41:35.754
You go first.

41:35.893 --> 41:37.485
Make it quick.

41:38.128 --> 41:40.688
Come on, let's find you some dresses.

41:44.368 --> 41:47.895
That gentleman wouldn't let my cousin in
without an invitation.

41:49.073 --> 41:49.971
And who are you?

41:50.541 --> 41:53.408
We're policemen. We're here for security.

41:53.744 --> 41:54.802
And what's your name?

41:56.480 --> 41:57.469
This is Dragon Ma.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.347
Dragon, I forgot to give her
the invitation.

42:01.552 --> 42:02.610
may she come in?

42:02.820 --> 42:03.718
Of course.

42:05.089 --> 42:05.953
Thanks

42:06.390 --> 42:07.288
Thank you!

42:07.491 --> 42:08.116
Come on.

42:13.330 --> 42:14.024
Sorry.

42:14.398 --> 42:15.194
Don't worry.

42:20.504 --> 42:21.971
Tell Mars to keep an eye on them.

42:22.106 --> 42:22.731
Yes, sir...

42:24.575 --> 42:25.507
Who are they?

42:25.943 --> 42:28.173
The man's called Man. I don't know
the woman's name.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.710
Beware of strangers.

42:37.721 --> 42:38.346
Thank you.

42:39.023 --> 42:41.719
She's very pretty. Do you know
who she is?

42:41.926 --> 42:42.722
I've no idea, sir.

42:43.127 --> 42:45.186
So no one can introduce me then?

42:45.396 --> 42:46.260
I'll introduce her to you, sir.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.593
She's not a friend of yours?

42:57.007 --> 42:58.304
Are you ready?
Go ahead.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.876
This way.

42:59.910 --> 43:02.174
This way. The necklace is in the
office behind the painting.

43:02.513 --> 43:04.413
Breathe in. That should do it.

43:06.450 --> 43:07.439
Nearly.

43:08.185 --> 43:10.085
This dress is very tight.

43:10.487 --> 43:12.512
They're all like that.

43:12.723 --> 43:13.451
Get the back.

43:13.624 --> 43:14.318
Don't move.

43:14.558 --> 43:15.525
That's ok.

43:15.659 --> 43:16.785
What do you think?

43:17.127 --> 43:17.957
Lovely!

43:19.463 --> 43:21.397
So you were brought up in Shanghai

43:21.498 --> 43:23.227
but you don't have an accent.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.129
Maybe I don't, but you don't have to

43:25.269 --> 43:27.362
have athlete's foot to be an athlete.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.299
Sorry.

43:28.472 --> 43:28.961
Please.

43:29.206 --> 43:30.230
Miss, you're really witty.

43:30.407 --> 43:32.841
I like meeting people like you.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.304
He says that to all the ladies.

43:34.545 --> 43:35.842
Don't listen to him.

43:36.113 --> 43:38.877
Your Excellency has found a
rare pearl indeed.

43:41.652 --> 43:43.745
You look wonderful in this dress.

43:47.891 --> 43:49.153
Better stay alert

43:50.661 --> 43:52.629
Daddy, do I look pretty?

43:52.796 --> 43:55.560
Absolutely lovely, my dear.

43:55.966 --> 43:57.194
And what about the dress?

43:57.368 --> 43:59.302
But I was talking about the dress.

44:01.839 --> 44:03.739
Let me have the first dance. Come on.

44:03.841 --> 44:05.741
Music.

44:18.555 --> 44:20.819
Miss, may I have the pleasure
of this dance?

44:21.291 --> 44:22.315
Go on. It'll be fun.

44:22.459 --> 44:24.290
May I have this dance?

44:45.883 --> 44:47.646
Daddy, are you happy?

44:47.785 --> 44:50.754
Of course. You're very
beautiful tonight.

44:50.921 --> 44:52.354
Why aren't you looking at me?

44:52.589 --> 44:53.419
Where do you live?

44:53.657 --> 44:54.453
James' Street.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.718
It's a dangerous town, you must
be careful.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.623
With policemen like you to catch

44:58.796 --> 45:01.390
all the criminals, I feel quite safe.

45:02.299 --> 45:06.133
Do you think Hong Kong is a
dangerous place to live?

45:06.403 --> 45:08.064
Dangerous? Not really.

45:08.238 --> 45:09.330
What do you do all day long?

45:10.107 --> 45:12.234
Sit in my office and drink coffee.

45:14.278 --> 45:16.337
When I leave the dance floor.

45:16.547 --> 45:18.913
go upstairs with Carina

45:19.083 --> 45:20.311
to distract the security guards.

45:20.451 --> 45:22.612
Don't worry. We know what to do.

45:22.820 --> 45:25.380
How can you say it's not dangerous
with all the crime?

45:25.489 --> 45:28.720
If there wasn't any crime there wouldn't be any police.

45:29.026 --> 45:30.687
Perhaps we could take tea together.

45:31.562 --> 45:34.053
Excuse me, did you have garlic
for lunch?

45:39.336 --> 45:41.827
The Commissioner's office is opposite
his daughter's bedroom.

45:43.373 --> 45:46.206
I'll climb up outside.
Wait for me in her room.

45:46.410 --> 45:47.172
Ok.

45:48.011 --> 45:51.879
In my spare time, I go shopping

45:52.116 --> 45:53.845
I go to theatre or I paint pictures.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.249
You paint? I love painting.

46:32.990 --> 46:33.979
What is it?

46:34.191 --> 46:35.089
I've torn the dress.

46:35.259 --> 46:36.055
What's up?

46:37.194 --> 46:38.252
Let's go and fix it.

46:38.328 --> 46:39.295
Excuse me.

46:45.903 --> 46:47.598
Nobody has changed partners with us.

46:47.771 --> 46:48.897
Don't you like my company?

46:49.072 --> 46:51.768
Of course. But I have to use the ladies.

46:52.276 --> 46:54.904
All right, let me show you where it is.

46:55.245 --> 46:56.007
Thanks.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.110
Right, let me fix it for you.

47:07.157 --> 47:08.715
I can't see. Stop that.

47:12.162 --> 47:13.220
It's really hot.

47:13.430 --> 47:13.987
It's not.

47:14.231 --> 47:15.698
You're right, open the window.

47:15.866 --> 47:16.696
I'll do it.

47:17.467 --> 47:19.094
The invitations are real.

47:19.236 --> 47:20.464
but where did they get them from?

47:20.704 --> 47:22.103
He's not dancing, do you think...

47:34.318 --> 47:35.649
Tell me which one you like.

47:38.655 --> 47:38.950
It's lovely.

47:39.356 --> 47:40.323
Which one?

47:41.158 --> 47:42.125
Be quiet.

47:42.292 --> 47:43.156
What is it?

47:44.962 --> 47:47.294
Nothing, you have a lovely figure.

47:47.464 --> 47:49.728
Really? Thanks a lot.

47:50.133 --> 47:51.225
What's going on, Carina?

47:51.401 --> 47:52.595
Nothing.

47:55.572 --> 47:57.005
Which one shall I wear?

47:58.108 --> 47:58.870
Go!

48:04.214 --> 48:05.681
I am sorry, I am so sorry.

48:05.883 --> 48:06.611
Please.

48:09.353 --> 48:12.322
Daddy, I was thinking about this one
for the cake. Is this pretty?

48:12.456 --> 48:14.515
Why don't you ask my friend Miss Pak?

48:14.791 --> 48:16.258
You look pretty in anything.

48:16.593 --> 48:17.582
Thank you.

48:17.794 --> 48:19.261
I liked the one you wore earlier.

48:20.130 --> 48:21.927
Then maybe I'll put it back on.

48:22.633 --> 48:24.066
These girls...

48:24.468 --> 48:25.230
Sorry, sir

48:27.938 --> 48:28.529
Have you seen...

48:28.739 --> 48:29.569
I've seen nothing

48:29.773 --> 48:31.934
but you've seen my daughter undressed.

48:32.042 --> 48:34.704
Being in charge of security doesn't
mean you can charge in anywhere.

48:34.978 --> 48:35.808
Out!

48:36.446 --> 48:37.242
Sorry, sir.

48:38.181 --> 48:39.113
Out!

48:39.283 --> 48:40.113
Yes, sir...

48:42.753 --> 48:44.277
He's out of his mind!

48:54.498 --> 48:58.332
All right now, ladies.
Don't take too long.

49:01.505 --> 49:02.972
My bedroom's here.

49:03.173 --> 49:05.664
What does your bedroom look like?

49:06.944 --> 49:08.969
Quick. They're waiting for me
for the cake.

49:09.146 --> 49:09.942
Go.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.061
Your room is huge!

49:30.233 --> 49:33.498
I find it much too big since
my wife's death.

49:35.505 --> 49:36.529
Please.

49:39.376 --> 49:40.866
This is beautiful!

49:41.044 --> 49:43.842
It's just a normal office for a
colonial service man.

49:44.147 --> 49:45.876
I only own the paintings

49:46.049 --> 49:49.041
all the rest belong to the Government.

49:49.086 --> 49:51.111
So you can't give me a souvenir?

49:53.290 --> 49:55.724
I just bought them. So they're
not framed.

49:55.759 --> 49:56.453
May I see them?

49:56.593 --> 50:00.552
If you'd like to, sure.

50:00.764 --> 50:02.356
Of course. I bought this in London.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.433
I liked it very much when I saw it.

50:04.634 --> 50:05.601
I like it very much, too!

50:06.269 --> 50:08.669
I'm sure you'll like the other one.

50:08.705 --> 50:09.899
Let me get it for you.

50:10.207 --> 50:11.469
Besides being a collector

50:11.608 --> 50:12.575
do you paint?

50:12.743 --> 50:15.371
Yes, I do. I paint sometimes.

50:15.579 --> 50:18.980
But I'll be embarrassed to
show them to people.

50:19.683 --> 50:22.550
And you? What do you like to paint most?

50:22.719 --> 50:24.482
Chinese landscapes mostly.

50:24.921 --> 50:27.549
Really? I love Chinese landscapes.

50:27.724 --> 50:29.453
But I don't know much about them.

50:29.626 --> 50:32.288
I have two more somewhere, but I can't
remember where I put them.

50:32.496 --> 50:33.485
They're not here.

50:35.098 --> 50:38.329
They might still be in the box.

50:38.535 --> 50:39.593
Don't worry if you can't find them.

50:39.803 --> 50:43.330
We've got time, the cake's not ready yet.

50:44.274 --> 50:48.608
They're not here. Strange.
Maybe they haven't arrived yet.

50:59.790 --> 51:00.449
Don't move!

51:01.758 --> 51:02.315
Hold it!

51:02.959 --> 51:03.653
What's going on?

51:04.361 --> 51:04.986
What's going on?

51:05.128 --> 51:05.822
Thief, sir.

51:10.000 --> 51:10.898
What?

51:12.869 --> 51:13.733
What are you doing?

51:13.870 --> 51:14.859
There's been a theft!

51:18.041 --> 51:18.837
Damn!

51:35.492 --> 51:36.857
What a lovely cake!

51:40.130 --> 51:41.290
It's so big.

51:43.467 --> 51:44.729
It's beautiful.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.973
I'm sorry.
What?

51:53.410 --> 51:54.308
Don't move.

51:55.512 --> 51:56.740
Sorry, everyone.

51:57.948 --> 51:58.937
You are under arrest.

51:59.516 --> 52:01.108
Why?
Me?

52:01.251 --> 52:02.115
What? Dragon!

52:02.886 --> 52:03.944
You can't deny it.

52:04.087 --> 52:05.918
I saw you stealing something
in the study.

52:06.156 --> 52:07.054
Somebody's stolen the necklace

52:07.224 --> 52:10.785
I bought for Regina's birthday.

52:10.927 --> 52:11.689
He's the one.

52:12.062 --> 52:14.223
You're accusing me of stealing?
And the evidence?

52:14.764 --> 52:16.789
You better search him.

52:17.067 --> 52:18.056
He has a number of accomplices

52:18.301 --> 52:19.996
I doubt he still has it on him.

52:20.770 --> 52:23.739
Dragon, if you make accusations

52:24.040 --> 52:25.507
you'd better be able to back them up.

52:25.675 --> 52:29.042
Ladies and gentlemen, we don't like this
any more than you.

52:29.346 --> 52:30.643
But to prove your innocence

52:30.780 --> 52:34.511
I'm sure you won't mind a search
by one of my officers.

52:34.718 --> 52:35.582
You want to search me?

52:35.852 --> 52:38.286
If you're innocent, you won't mind.

52:38.522 --> 52:40.387
Needless to say, you'll start with me.

52:40.557 --> 52:41.922
However, to be fair

52:42.058 --> 52:45.118
I think we should start with Mr Ma.

52:45.262 --> 52:45.990
All right.

52:47.230 --> 52:49.130
Chun, can you search him?

52:49.799 --> 52:52.393
Chief, it's better if you do it.

52:53.036 --> 52:54.401
Right, if you wish.

53:05.649 --> 53:08.140
It's part of the diamond necklace.

53:09.152 --> 53:10.050
Where did you get this?

53:10.921 --> 53:12.218
Someone must have set him up.

53:18.361 --> 53:21.330
Mr Ma really is a wonderful actor.

53:21.464 --> 53:22.362
Ladies and gentlemen

53:22.566 --> 53:25.729
this was all part of the
evening's entertainment.

53:25.869 --> 53:27.928
However Mr Ma is such a good actor

53:28.138 --> 53:30.072
he fooled everyone person.

53:30.106 --> 53:31.630
I just hope everyone enjoyed it.

53:32.609 --> 53:33.337
Daddy!

53:33.510 --> 53:34.807
A surprise.

53:34.978 --> 53:36.172
You almost scared me to death.

53:36.313 --> 53:37.371
Let's have the cake.

53:45.689 --> 53:47.782
You really arranged everything, sir?

53:48.024 --> 53:50.652
Of course not. Where's the necklace?

53:50.927 --> 53:51.951
I've no idea, sir.

53:52.095 --> 53:54.029
Then what is this doing in your pocket?

53:56.066 --> 53:57.033
I demand an explanation!

54:00.503 --> 54:01.731
So it wasn't a game?

54:02.005 --> 54:03.734
Did it look like a game to you?

54:03.940 --> 54:06.170
No, I suppose it didn't. What now?

54:06.209 --> 54:07.676
I should be asking that.

54:07.877 --> 54:09.071
You're the policeman.

54:09.212 --> 54:10.008
Yes, sir...

54:10.480 --> 54:11.344
Arrest him.

54:11.548 --> 54:12.913
But, sir...
Shut up! It's an order.

54:13.016 --> 54:16.281
I expect you to get to the bottom
of this and quickly.

54:16.553 --> 54:17.212
Yes, sir...

54:19.689 --> 54:20.678
Take him away.

54:25.228 --> 54:26.786
You have to make a wish.

54:26.997 --> 54:27.861
All right.

54:40.910 --> 54:43.708
Did you set Dragon up with
the necklace that night?

54:43.880 --> 54:46.906
I don't know much about that.
but he's innocent.

54:47.050 --> 54:48.642
He's a nice person.

54:48.718 --> 54:51.846
We had to do it for the good
of the country, don't forget.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.454
Hot dumplings!

54:54.858 --> 54:56.416
Do you want some dumpling?
All right.

55:00.163 --> 55:01.653
What do you want in them?

55:02.365 --> 55:04.765
Carina.

55:06.569 --> 55:07.729
Carina.

55:10.440 --> 55:14.342
Carina. Where are you?

55:15.712 --> 55:18.647
Carina.

55:19.182 --> 55:20.149
Maggie, what's the matter?

55:22.519 --> 55:23.713
My cousin has disappeared.

55:23.820 --> 55:24.809
What?

55:25.021 --> 55:26.682
She just disappeared in the thin air!

55:27.023 --> 55:28.183
Suddenly disappeared?

55:32.595 --> 55:34.426
She won't talk, but I found this.

55:34.564 --> 55:37.158
Go to this address, see if
you find the others.

55:37.400 --> 55:38.094
Yes, sir...

55:38.501 --> 55:41.026
You must avoid the police.

55:41.471 --> 55:42.267
Yes, sir...

55:43.106 --> 55:45.870
You're in big trouble if the
Chief finds out.

55:46.042 --> 55:47.703
Not if we find the necklace.

55:47.911 --> 55:50.311
Why do you think Carina's involved?

55:50.480 --> 55:52.914
She and Man were dancing all evening.

55:55.151 --> 55:57.711
Sir! I have a release order here.

55:57.887 --> 55:58.876
I'm allowed to take him out.

56:00.123 --> 56:01.283
Is this your first day?

56:01.458 --> 56:03.153
You've forgotten the handcuffs.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.156
Sorry.

56:04.494 --> 56:12.902
I'll keep this with me for safety.

56:13.103 --> 56:14.035
Thank you sir

56:17.340 --> 56:18.034
What's up?

56:18.208 --> 56:19.800
We don't have to show everybody.

56:22.979 --> 56:23.741
Let's go and see the warden.

56:23.913 --> 56:24.538
Yes, sir...

56:26.316 --> 56:28.614
All I want is for the prisoner to be

56:28.752 --> 56:30.447
taken down the road towards the sea.

56:30.620 --> 56:32.850
After that, you'll never
need to work again.

56:34.190 --> 56:35.088
It's really that simple?

56:35.658 --> 56:37.626
It's that simple.

56:38.695 --> 56:39.593
It's a deal.

56:41.698 --> 56:42.528
Anyone here?

56:50.006 --> 56:52.201
With any luck, she'll be back by now.

56:55.478 --> 56:56.069
Be quiet!

56:57.947 --> 56:59.642
Carina. Carina!

57:01.418 --> 57:02.350
Carina.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.322
Oh, no. I can't find her anywhere.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.524
I wonder who kidnapped her.

57:10.160 --> 57:12.355
Sometimes it's better not to know.

57:14.397 --> 57:15.364
It's her!

57:18.334 --> 57:19.995
You two again.
Right.

57:20.236 --> 57:21.225
Any news of Carina?

57:21.404 --> 57:22.803
She's not back yet. And you?

57:23.006 --> 57:23.836
We're still working on it.

57:24.007 --> 57:25.804
Hold on, I'll finish changing.

57:26.509 --> 57:27.168
Who is it?

57:27.377 --> 57:28.742
Dragon and his man.

57:28.845 --> 57:29.777
It's about the necklace.

57:30.046 --> 57:30.978
I'd better hide.

57:32.749 --> 57:33.716
Any ideas?

57:33.883 --> 57:36.010
It's linked to the necklace case.

57:36.152 --> 57:36.880
That's right.

57:37.153 --> 57:38.245
That's right.
Are you involved?

57:38.388 --> 57:40.481
That's what the Commissioner
told us to say.

57:40.657 --> 57:42.124
Does your cousin know a Mr Man?

57:43.259 --> 57:44.317
No, she doesn't.

57:44.994 --> 57:45.722
Sit down, please.

57:52.335 --> 57:53.029
We're like brothers.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.099
Yeah.

58:01.311 --> 58:02.073
Do you need to go the bathroom?

58:02.212 --> 58:02.940
No.

58:03.179 --> 58:04.237
But you said you needed to.

58:04.414 --> 58:05.608
When?

58:06.015 --> 58:07.778
Yeah, I did say that.

58:08.017 --> 58:08.642
Where's the bathroom?

58:08.852 --> 58:10.877
The bathroom?! Over there.

58:11.087 --> 58:11.746
Thanks.

58:12.255 --> 58:13.449
I only have one bathroom.

58:13.723 --> 58:14.849
We always go together.

58:14.958 --> 58:16.016
Yeah, since we were kids.

58:16.226 --> 58:16.885
Thanks.

58:22.999 --> 58:23.488
All clear?

58:23.700 --> 58:24.667
They're in the bathroom.

58:24.834 --> 58:26.734
All right. I'm leaving now.

58:37.580 --> 58:38.547
Good morning.

58:39.115 --> 58:41.106
Excuse me, I'm just getting changed.

58:43.453 --> 58:44.715
Chief Inspector Tung is here!

58:44.921 --> 58:46.946
What's he doing here?

58:47.123 --> 58:49.353
Keep him talking, I'll be in the back.

58:50.260 --> 58:51.386
Chief Inspector Tung?

58:53.363 --> 58:54.057
Chief Inspector Tung

58:54.230 --> 58:54.855
For you

58:55.331 --> 58:56.161
Thanks.

58:56.599 --> 58:57.531
Can I help you with anything?

58:58.134 --> 59:00.398
I was just passing by.

59:00.570 --> 59:01.366
And the flowers?

59:02.138 --> 59:04.299
I confiscated them from a hawker.

59:04.541 --> 59:08.238
I must say you've got a

59:08.444 --> 59:11.538
very pleasant place here

59:11.714 --> 59:14.808
so bright and airy

59:15.218 --> 59:18.346
and beautifully decorated.

59:19.656 --> 59:21.521
Oh, yes, your two officers are right...

59:22.759 --> 59:23.418
My two officers what?

59:29.832 --> 59:31.094
My two officers are what?

59:31.768 --> 59:33.497
Where are your officers?

59:34.304 --> 59:37.068
They're all downstairs waiting for me.

59:38.808 --> 59:42.574
I'll patrol around this area everyday.
Just in case.

59:43.613 --> 59:44.477
What is it?

59:46.950 --> 59:47.848
Are you all right?

59:48.885 --> 59:49.977
Indigestion.

59:54.223 --> 59:56.214
It's hiccups. I have a cure.

59:57.527 --> 59:58.516
Does it work?

59:59.195 --> 01:00:02.460
It's a very ancient remedy.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.067
You're cured. It always works.

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:09.003
Are you better now?

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:10.070
Yes. I am.

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:12.504
If you have hiccups again you know what to do.

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.174
I was wondering...

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.834
Why don't we put them in a vase?

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.445
Yeah? Sure!

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:24.385
Let me help you.

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:26.416
Where's the water tap?

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.179
Behind you.

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:34.595
Normally

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:38.222
I close this window when I'm cooking.

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:40.491
Are you cooking now?

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:46.133
No, I'm not cooking now, I may
as well leave it open.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.978
You've got a problem here but I can fix it.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.110
Thanks.

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:00.450
Don't move!

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:07.329
It won't hurt, it's just a little water.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.897
Stand back or you'll get wet.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.258
It won't take too long.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.259
I'll go and get a towel.

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.237
All right, the coast is clear.

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:36.419
I'm sorry. I fixed it but I got all wet.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.424
Thank you. Wow...

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.254
Oh, it's nothing.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.956
I was chief of waterworks before.

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:46.127
My uniform's wet.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.563
I'll hang it up for you.

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:48.666
Thanks.

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.028
Enough heroics.

01:01:58.981 --> 01:01:59.879
You're still here?!

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:01.840
There are lots of police downstairs.

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:03.680
Keys.

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:08.948
Quick! Hurry!

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:12.392
Maggie!

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.255
Where are you?

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:21.134
Finished!

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:22.593
Where will I put them?

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:23.667
In the living room.

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:25.239
Can you hang this out to dry

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:26.965
and lend me a shirt?

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:36.980
What's up?

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:38.045
It won't open.

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:39.219
Let me.

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:45.159
The humid weather makes the wood expand.
Hold this.

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:46.660
Try this side.

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:48.889
That's ok now.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.368
I hope this will do.

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.068
It will have to.

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.223
Thank you.

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:18.724
I'll iron your jacket.

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:21.425
No, it can't be ironed. It must be
hang dried.

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.597
It's all right. I'm patient. I can wait.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:37.973
That's what it was!

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:39.040
They're...

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:41.410
They're handcuffs. We use them
on prisoners.

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:45.918
When you arrest a criminal, you put
this end on his arm

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:49.387
and you put this end on your own arm so he can't escape.

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.115
When there are two thieves and one runs off.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.628
then...

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:57.290
Lock him here and go find another one.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.398
When you return, will he still be here?

01:03:58.568 --> 01:03:59.762
He can't move, can't he?

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.102
I left my keys in my jacket.

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:05.205
I'll get them.

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:12.676
That must be your cousin.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.950
It's Chun!

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.885
Really? Tell him I'm not here.

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.285
No! He's here to see me.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.550
Tell him you're not here.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.855
He's already seen me!

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:28.891
Why did I handcuff myself?

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:29.859
I must hide.

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:34.860
I need a hiding place.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.770
I'm just changing.

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:43.241
Go over there.

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:44.936
All right, quickly.

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.206
Go that way!

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:47.279
This way.

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.874
Ow! That hurts!

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.143
Quick!

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.286
Where will I hide?

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:54.388
Under the bed.

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:55.352
All right.

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:56.684
This one here, it's safer.

01:04:56.826 --> 01:04:58.521
All right, the sofa first.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.889
You must get under the bed first.

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:01.825
All right, whatever you say.

01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:03.056
Come on, hurry.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:15.438
Don't move.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:17.805
Sorry, I was just changing.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.708
It's ok.

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:21.639
Chun, is this your beat now?

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:24.479
Yes, it is. Nice place you have here.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:34.395
So, do you have any complaints
about the district?

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.190
Yes, a lot.

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:38.233
Really? What are they?

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.959
Well, it's becoming dangerous
around here.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:41.228
Just last night...

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:44.698
Forget it.

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:46.466
Please, sit down.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:47.568
Thanks.

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:48.975
I'll go and make some tea.

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.008
Thank you.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:54.947
Oh, no. I've no hot water.
I'll get some drinks from the shop.

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:56.412
Don't worry.

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:58.951
Chun, do you visit everybody

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:00.552
as part of your police duties?

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:03.725
Yes, of course.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.654
I'd better go.

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:06.795
Good idea.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:11.555
Bye! Take care, Chun.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.462
Don't forget if you're ever in the area

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.636
feel free to drop by.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.208
Me?

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:25.045
You guys I mean...

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.090
If Chun's gone, I'd better go, too.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.195
What are you doing?

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:48.462
I thought I'd give you a goodbye kiss.

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:50.366
No, you don't!

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.538
That was wonderful.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:56.539
Hurry up now, or you'll be late.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.441
You've had your kiss, now go.

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:04.241
When are you going?

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.980
Now. I promised to meet
some of my officers.

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:08.719
Well. OK?

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.620
No. There are two men up there.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.949
Another two?

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:13.420
How did they all get in my house?

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:14.687
What now?

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:16.961
Come on, this way.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.894
Where are the damn keys?

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:42.589
<i>Who are the bravest cops in history?</i>

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.257
<i>The Hong Kong Police!</i>

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:48.794
<i>You should see the way we catch thieves!</i>

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:51.489
<i>Rain and hail and heat and typhoon</i>

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:55.626
<i>Nothing stops us, because we're
the toughest cops ever!</i>

01:07:57.573 --> 01:08:00.542
<i>And who are the greatest people
in all Hong Kong?</i>

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:02.334
<i>It's our policemen</i>

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:07.074
<i>They don't need to catch any robbers</i>

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:09.877
<i>Because they're the crooks</i>

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:14.182
<i>They take bribes and get rehousing</i>

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:15.084
Don't move!

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:16.654
Keep on! Keep on!

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:23.856
<i>And Mr Tung, why do you
have a moustache?</i>

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:25.832
<i>Because I'm proud of myself</i>

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:35.410
Who are you?

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:37.238
Let's get him!

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:39.975
What are you doing here?

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.946
Are you alone?
Go on, beat him up.

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:45.577
Stab him. Stab his heart.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.053
Stab his thigh. Kick his ass.

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.520
Talk!

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.627
Keep on! Keep on!

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:56.792
Stop...

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:58.832
He's going to die! Is he dead?

01:08:59.135 --> 01:08:59.794
Still breathing.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.035
Tell us or I'll blow your head off.

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:05.136
Hold it! I've got two hostages.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.139
Move and I'll shoot them both dead.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.368
We have a hostage, too.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.569
Choy, are you OK?

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:11.339
Sure, he might live.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:15.175
OK, we'll exchange a hostage but no funny business.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:16.212
Move it!

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:23.685
Choy, are you hurt?

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:30.658
Don't move an inch.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:32.529
Are you Ok my dear Carina?

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:33.665
Go find the keys for me.

01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:36.604
I was really worried about you.

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:40.533
I work for the dowager empress.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.144
So what are you doing here, then?

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.073
I'm here to arrest rebels.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:47.144
The Hong Kong police can't touch us.

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:48.680
We have different laws here.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.411
And our laws apply to everyone
in Hong Kong, including you.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:52.952
Will he obey the law though?

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:56.015
Lock him up along with this one here.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.523
Send them back to Manchuria.

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.390
I can't find them, sir.

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.564
I know, let's shoot the lock off.

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.029
What if you hurt me?

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:05.792
Be accurate!

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:06.865
Lock them up first.

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:08.864
Go find them!

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:09.866
What about me? Look at me.

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.566
Be careful, sir.

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:17.905
Don't worry about me

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.948
just get Ma back to the prison.

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:22.140
I'll change my signature next time.

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:24.107
Upright!

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.555
Chief, your hand.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.089
My hand's holding important evidence

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.324
which proves they're thieves.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.631
Where are your keys? Open it.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:37.357
Yes, sir.

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:41.127
I have the cuffs, but not the keys.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.602
All right, I'll take them in.

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.832
Dragon, you're not free yet, you

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:49.877
have to be back in prison by sunset.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:51.404
I'll take him back.

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:53.946
I can do that for you, sir.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:55.741
Come on, let's go.

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:57.317
Move it.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.314
You know what to do.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.011
Yes, sir.

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:03.049
Out of the way! Stand back.

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:04.783
Dragon, you know the rules, don't you?

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:06.355
Yes, sir.

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:13.560
Sir.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.897
can you take off the cuffs? I won't run away.

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:17.436
I don't have my keys with me.

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:26.608
Dragon Ma, you're a dead man!

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:29.015
Who are you?

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.913
We're victims of your heroism.

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.281
We'll kill you today.

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.720
I've nothing to do with this.

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:37.083
Get lost, then.

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.252
What about me?!

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:41.054
Good luck.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.423
This is for Captain San po.

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:43.223
Yes.

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.265
My keys! My keys!

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:48.570
Stop there.

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:49.897
Do you know who he is?

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.563
I'm a superintendent.

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:55.102
We don't give a shit!

01:11:58.914 --> 01:11:59.938
Hey, up here.
What?

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.479
I said up there.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:05.142
I didn't hear you.

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:11.724
Come on, we've got to work together.

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.725
Higher.

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:18.931
Out of the way!

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:21.935
Not that way.

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:27.866
We're police!
Help, we're being attacked.

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:32.345
This way, come on.

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.249
We've got to jump.

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.346
Quick!

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:43.988
Stop!

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:44.989
Quick!

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:52.360
This way.

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:56.796
Open up. Open up.

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:08.213
What's happening?

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:09.916
Over here.

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:11.108
Over here, officer.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.447
Over here.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.158
Why did you hit me?

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.002
Try this.

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:35.636
Well...

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:36.334
Come on.

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.204
Go!

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.044
You are dead!

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.015
There's no way!

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.786
This way, come on.

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:57.195
Come on.

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:07.537
You almost got me killed!

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:14.208
This way.

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:27.852
You! Tell me who you are

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:29.087
or I'll kill you.

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.170
Help!

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:49.780
That hurts!

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:51.516
It's them.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.482
They're officers!

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:53.279
Upright!

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.116
Get the men inside, hurry!

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:56.681
Police!

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:57.191
Kill!

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:57.858
There's many of them!

01:14:57.926 --> 01:14:58.620
Run!

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:08.367
The bread!

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:09.298
Forget it!

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:10.063
But it's bread!

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:10.967
Bread?

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:13.967
They've gone.

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:15.939
Everyone back to the station.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:18.203
What?! Go after them!

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:23.881
Where are you from, sir?

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:25.076
Shandong.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.345
In all Shandong, there's no one...

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.217
...as tall as me?

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:29.816
No, as clumsy as you.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:30.953
What's that?

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:31.853
Sorry sir

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:32.789
Let's go.

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:50.044
Once you're back in Canton you'd better keep a low profile.

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:52.373
There are spies everywhere.

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:53.638
I'll be careful.

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:55.247
I don't have much time.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.908
Please give this to Maggie.

01:15:57.486 --> 01:16:00.250
I hope when we meet again it will be in victory.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:01.250
Sure.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.081
Goodbye

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:04.690
Goodbye

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:27.145
It's Chun!

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.505
Hey, Superintendent.

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:29.443
Warden.

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:30.277
Nice to see you here.

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:31.010
Are you OK?

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:32.676
He almost got me killed.

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:33.479
Where are you going?

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:34.483
Back to my office.

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.419
Great, you can take him back to jail.

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:38.156
Have you got the keys?

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.690
Go find the others.

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:47.633
Thanks.

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:48.565
You're welcome.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:50.966
Goodbye, Dragon.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.436
Goodbye.

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:57.946
Waiter, a cup of tea.
Yes, sir.

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:02.477
This isn't the way to the prison.

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:04.585
It's a short cut to another place.

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:05.447
Where?

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:08.716
Hell.

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:17.096
What?

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.394
Release me!

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.291
What are you trying to do?

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:25.835
Quick!

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:30.634
What's going on?

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.843
We'll say he fell in the water
if they ask.

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:39.749
Yes.

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:51.864
He doesn't look too good.

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:52.864
He's hungry.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:53.998
How do you know?

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.965
Aren't you hungry?!

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.102
We all are.

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:57.500
His head's real hot.

01:17:57.706 --> 01:17:58.934
He's got a fever.

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:01.473
This is all Dragon Ma's fault.

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:05.645
It's not Ma's fault.
it's all our own fault.

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:09.581
If I'd found us all proper jobs when
we landed instead of looking for Ma

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:13.585
we'd never have ended up like this.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:16.756
You should have said that
from the start.

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.756
But he killed many of our brothers.

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:20.690
It's his job, he's a policeman

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:22.295
like it's our job

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:23.488
to kill people.

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.099
Why didn't you say that before?

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.162
Yeah!

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:29.627
Who cares? Let's see what's wrong
with him first.

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:30.895
Are you all right?

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.707
I'm hot and cold.

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:35.870
The hot and cold thing!

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:37.036
What?!

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:38.401
We've got to get some medicine.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.347
Come on.

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.914
Thank you for letting my men go.

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:44.248
Is there anything else I can do?

01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:47.547
I came here to capture some assassins.

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:49.452
Is our Government offering any help?

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:52.424
There's a reward of 5.000 taels

01:18:53.028 --> 01:18:54.825
for each of them.

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:59.159
Chun, that will be brilliant.

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:14.008
It was you who saved my life.

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:15.808
If we didn't do what Chun asked.

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.980
you wouldn't have gone to jail.

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.178
We owed you one.

01:19:20.455 --> 01:19:21.752
Why did you set me up?

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:25.017
We needed money to buy weapons so we did a deal with Chun.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.822
Then we realised we'd helped him
set up a good cop.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.057
Where's the necklace?

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:32.427
It's in the Commissioner's study inside one of his books.

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.461
You did save my life.

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.106
I guess I'll let it go this time.

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.168
Are you going?

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.373
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone
your secret.

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:46.209
That'll only help our revolution.

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:47.776
But you still worry us.

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:48.845
Really?

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.108
You still want to be a cop?

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:51.376
What else can I do?

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:54.113
Join us, the revolution.

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:57.992
If we had comrades like you

01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:59.388
we'd have a better chance.

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:00.822
I won't join you.

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:04.327
Are you still angry about what we did?

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:06.564
You've got to bend the rules to
achieve a noble goal.

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.426
We're even prepared to sacrifice

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:11.067
our lives for the revolution.

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:13.400
That's exactly why I can't join.

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:15.405
There's no way I can bend the rules.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.545
However noble the cause, I can't change.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.978
As far as I'm concerned. I couldn't

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.946
break the law to achieve any goal.

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:25.913
However, I do admire you.

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:27.954
I think one day you'll succeed.

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:30.889
I understand that to overthrow the

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:33.117
Government, lots of people must die.

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:34.985
But I won't ask people to do that

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:37.324
because I don't know what will be

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:39.056
left once the sacrifices are over.

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:42.265
So I'll remain a policeman.

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.702
I think every life is precious and

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.035
I want everyone to have a happy life.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.870
A country of 400,000,000 people

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.509
is made up of individuals.

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:52.179
If they hate their lives

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:54.179
how can they love their country?

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:55.609
I see what you mean.

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.449
I'll remember your words.

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.754
We're both working

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:00.888
for the people but in different ways.

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:03.320
So being a policeman is noble after all.

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:05.751
But they won't let any good policemen

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:08.055
exist in a colonial region.

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:09.730
They'll destroy you

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:12.128
I'm here to fight those people.

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:20.131
Take care.

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.238
Goodbye.

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:31.010
Uncle Koon, she only left me a letter.

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:32.175
Why did she leave in such a hurry?

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.384
Maybe it was urgent.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.081
Thank you. I'm going. Goodbye.

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:43.929
OK, I'll go.

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.529
Give me that axe.

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:47.827
Let's hope this works.

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:48.694
Be nice.

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.466
Excuse me, brother.

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:53.335
I need some medicine, and
can I pay later?

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.735
Sorry, we don't do that here.

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.639
But a life is at stake.

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:58.938
We're not a charity.

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:00.136
If everybody was like you

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:01.679
we'd soon be out of business.

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:04.217
Give it to him.

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:04.977
Right.

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:06.677
But I'd like to know who you are

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:09.087
and what I did to offend you.

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:12.488
Perhaps I arrested your friends
by mistake before.

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:18.461
Wan, I'm going. You can put it on my slate.

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:21.465
My friend.

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:22.431
My friend.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:24.970
What's wrong with your friend?

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:26.140
The hot and cold thing.

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.137
What?

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.708
It's probably typhoid.
Yes.

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:35.946
Keep quiet!

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:41.052
Uncle Koon, run!

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:43.850
Now you have a warrant no one will stop you.

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:45.686
This way please, sir.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:49.126
Move along. This is police work.

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:49.886
Let's go.

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:50.961
Here he is.

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:52.198
Did you get it?

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:55.097
Yeah, look. I saw Dragon Ma, too.

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.167
Did you kill him?

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.762
No, he paid for the medicine.

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:03.769
They're all upstairs.

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:11.545
Uncle Koon, you first. See you later.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.277
Keep it.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:13.177
Come on.

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:14.317
It's Dragon Ma.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:15.782
Why is he still alive?

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:30.432
Here, take this.

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:31.300
Be careful.

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:54.756
Mr Chun, is something wrong?

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:56.088
No, it's just an arrest.

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.822
But we heard gunshots.

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:59.364
None of your business, carry on.

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:00.159
Yes, sir...

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:01.529
Go.

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:02.561
Go on!

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:03.695
Yes, sir...

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:08.471
Move along.

01:24:25.493 --> 01:24:27.461
Dragon Ma, you are lucky.

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:48.441
I think this is what you're looking for.

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.641
Chun, why the hell are doing this?

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.878
I'll tell you, you have your

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:54.613
conditions and I have mine.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:55.551
Thank you.

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:57.854
This is the one.

01:24:58.193 --> 01:25:00.593
Yan Kit, why did you betray us?

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:01.626
You bastard!

01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:08.457
So what? I'm merely carrying out
my duty to arrest rebels.

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.300
What do you want?

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:12.664
Chun.

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:13.398
Yes, sir.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:15.037
Your reward.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.142
Thank you, sir.

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:16.936
And the others?

01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:18.578
I'll take them back with me.

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:20.408
The boxes are ready, sir.

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:21.378
Damn you, Chun!

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.640
You were saying?

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:26.843
Do you know what you're doing?

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:29.188
What are you suggesting?

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.690
You won't get away with this.

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:35.091
Don't worry, I will get away with it.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.321
What have you got against me?

01:25:37.499 --> 01:25:38.898
You were against me from the start.

01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:40.967
I've nothing against you personally

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:43.101
but you keep interfering.

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:44.499
And you had my men arrested.

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.966
The longer I let you live

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.871
the more problems you'll cause me.

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:51.644
I was just doing my job as a policeman.

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:54.541
You're a good cop, I'm a bad cop, so

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:56.946
we're never going to see eye to eye.

01:25:57.085 --> 01:26:00.179
It's either you or me.
Do you understand?

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:05.122
That's enough. I'm not interested in
listening to your stories.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:08.388
That's right. You'd better leave
before the night market starts.

01:26:08.863 --> 01:26:10.558
But I don't want that man around.

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:11.459
Of course, I intend taking care

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.567
of him after you leave.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:16.830
Get on with it.

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:17.903
Let's do it

01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:21.034
Help!

01:26:21.242 --> 01:26:21.901
Maggie.

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:22.701
Shut up!

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:23.538
She knows nothing.

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.143
Forget her. I have something

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.803
special in mind for you.

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:27.605
Take him away.

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:28.511
Yes, sir. Move!

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:29.705
Move!

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:32.517
Stop that!

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.320
Go!

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:43.953
Throw him in there.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:52.600
Go help the others.

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:53.399
Yes, sir.

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.339
Yan kit, switch it on.

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:02.304
Don't think you can get out of there.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:03.508
It's impossible.

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:17.459
This batch of soy sauce will be delicious.

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:22.267
Our company is famous for its sauce
and it's for export only.

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:25.431
Your flesh and blood will be in every bottle

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:26.562
all to be shipped overseas.

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:28.241
Isn't that wonderful?

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:29.967
Well?

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:45.718
You're doing fine.

01:27:58.273 --> 01:27:59.365
Let's see how long you can keep it up.

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:06.040
I think we need to add a little oil.

01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:22.286
A little more there.

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:01.492
He's escaped!

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:02.294
After him!

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:13.912
Run!

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:18.416
Get the notebook.

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:20.947
Come on, hurry.

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.281
Use the stairwell!

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:25.818
What's up?

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:26.789
It's a dead end.

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:28.226
Come on, this way.

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:48.005
Hurry! This way.

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:49.380
Quick!

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:57.854
Quick!

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:58.926
Come on!

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:00.725
Don't let them escape!

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:11.130
You'll have to climb down.

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:13.741
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:14.870
No.

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:16.408
Take the basket.

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:19.471
Come on.

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:20.777
Hold on.

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:23.009
Just do like I do. I'll go first.

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:32.690
I'll catch you on the ground.

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:50.775
Go on, jump!

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:01.479
You're safe. You can get off me.

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:02.486
Quick!

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:06.320
This way.

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:12.961
Come on.

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:15.061
Quick, but be careful.

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:20.639
Quick

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:22.333
Quick! Help her.

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:26.470
Help!

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.517
Try to find a foothold. Hurry up.
Give me your hand.

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:36.853
Come.

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:38.917
Don't come any closer.

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:47.634
Hold on tight!

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:58.401
Jump, I'll catch you.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.404
No. Wait a minute, I'll get a board.

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.283
Go on, jump!

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:15.525
Let go! Come on!

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:27.065
Take the notebook.

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:28.708
You keep that. I can't make it.

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:30.503
Take the notebook and leave here.

01:32:31.712 --> 01:32:32.872
We can't escape.

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:35.412
Go.

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:37.577
Keep an eye on those two.
Yes

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:49.595
Block the exit.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.875
Dragon Ma?!

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:11.349
Give us the notebook.

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:12.549
I've eaten it.

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.744
Give it back and we'll let you go.

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:17.119
If I'd wanted to go, I'd be gone.

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:18.223
Enough talk!

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.258
We'll give you one more chance.

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.698
No thanks. I don't need any more.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.132
Get him!

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:33.166
It's fits me.

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:34.201
Get going.

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:35.969
How do I look?
Get going.

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:00.931
Come.

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:24.318
Luck is on my side.

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:25.983
Really?

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:50.042
Get the notebook.

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:53.675
Have you got it?

01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:14.533
What are you doing?

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.002
Why did you hit him?

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:53.203
Get him!

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:01.440
You go that way.

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.185
Go back!

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:36.333
Go and block his exit.

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:37.067
Yes, sir.

01:39:10.144 --> 01:39:11.907
Dragon Ma is not our friend.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.348
But if you lay a finger on him we won't be very happy.

01:39:15.549 --> 01:39:16.743
Hit him!

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:18.713
Hit!

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.568
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:44.843
Chief. Mr Chun has the situation covered.

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:45.569
Hold it!

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:50.147
It's the warden.

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:51.007
Bastards!

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:51.674
Come with me.

01:39:52.987 --> 01:39:54.511
Excuse me, I have an appointment.

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:31.381
Out of the way!

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:10.089
Hold it. Chun!

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:12.096
Here's your money.

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:18.300
Don't pull the rope or the whole thing
will come down.

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:33.819
Look out, it's falling.
Get out of the way!

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:50.626
Make sure Dragon's all right.

01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:01.775
Thank you, Mercial Goddess.

01:42:03.016 --> 01:42:03.880
He's all right!

01:42:04.184 --> 01:42:05.344
Chun's under there!

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:10.820
Let my men go free.

01:42:11.058 --> 01:42:11.956
Why?

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.525
I'm a representative of
the Ching Government.

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:17.487
My men were acting in self defence.

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:19.057
They must be allowed to leave.

01:42:24.071 --> 01:42:25.936
What did you say?

01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:26.834
What? Who are you?

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:28.100
You...

01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:30.676
You hear what he said?
Not a thing.

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:32.271
What again?

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:33.610
He got accent.

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.313
That's just what I thought.

01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:38.540
Dragon, are you all right?

01:42:38.685 --> 01:42:39.379
Yes, sir.

01:42:40.254 --> 01:42:41.619
You're finished!

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:44.653
Let them go.

01:42:48.362 --> 01:42:48.885
Thank you.

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:50.155
No need, I owe you one.

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:52.229
Dragon, what's going on here?

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:53.594
Dragon Ma.

01:42:58.138 --> 01:42:59.332
Do you remember why we came here?

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:00.064
Yes, we do.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.307
Kill.

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:03.339
He's dead. Let's go.

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:11.615
Dragon, who are they?

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:12.615
Just some friends.

01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:13.775
You didn't introduce us.

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:15.420
That's because I don't know them.

01:43:16.356 --> 01:43:17.084
Dismissed!

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.019
Yes, sir...

01:43:19.993 --> 01:43:21.187
Dismissed!
