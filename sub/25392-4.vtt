00:26.526 --> 00:27.653
Come on, Luke.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.871
Oh, shit. Must be on a mission.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.456
Gotcha.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.513
Oh...

00:55.430 --> 00:57.724
You told me
stay out of your yard.

00:57.808 --> 01:01.228
Harlem is not your yard, boy.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.771
It's mine.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.549
You can't talk tough
if you can't breathe, eh?

01:43.312 --> 01:44.313
Seen?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.482
What's... What's...

01:47.566 --> 01:48.567
My name?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.155
They call me Bushmaster.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.865
Who are you?

01:55.866 --> 01:58.327
The stone the builders refused.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.628
Luke.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.297
Luke!

03:27.374 --> 03:30.127
Damn, Luke. Shabba Ranks laid you out.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.135
You all right?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.595
Did you get a name?

03:40.679 --> 03:43.098
"Bushmaster." Some shit like that.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.558
You know them Jamaican niggas.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.935
Couldn't tell
if he was singing or talking.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.674
<i>Please leave your message for 718-555...</i>

05:09.017 --> 05:10.811
Oh.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.395
You look hungover. You okay?

05:12.896 --> 05:16.858
- You look like you had the long night.
- Me? I woke up like this.

05:16.942 --> 05:17.943
Whoa. What happened?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.863
I got ambushed by this Jamaican cat
named Bushmaster.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.990
He knocked me on my ass.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.492
Well, did he have a supersuit?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.412
No. He was just fast.

05:30.539 --> 05:31.873
Unnaturally fast.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.333
Well, he is Jamaican.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.417
Wait a minute.

05:34.501 --> 05:38.630
You telling me this cat was as strong
as you without any special equipment?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.758
- I gotta find him.
- No. Hold up.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.635
You don't look good. Let me call Claire.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.220
Bobby...

05:46.763 --> 05:47.764
don't.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.433
Aw, come on, man. You went Eric BenÃ©t?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.686
Really ain't your day, huh?

05:52.769 --> 05:54.479
Sit down, man. You look concussed.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.566
I've had worse when I was in high school.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.193
Just... Just takes some time
to shake it off.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.570
Yeah, well, don't take too long.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.737
I'm just saying,

06:02.821 --> 06:06.575
anyone who can take you on bare-handed
can't be good for Harlem.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.786
I'mma go to a bodega and get some ice.
The freezer's busted.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.970
You gotta be the only straight guy I know
who likes show tunes.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.054
Do you know any?

06:46.740 --> 06:47.699
Whoa, wait a minute.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.784
<i>You told me stay out of your yard.</i>

06:49.868 --> 06:51.995
- What?
<i>- Harlem is not your yard, boy.</i>

06:52.078 --> 06:53.872
- Yo, run that back.
<i>- It's mine.</i>

06:55.665 --> 06:58.376
Down goes Cage. Down goes Cage!

06:58.460 --> 07:00.295
Excuse me?

07:00.378 --> 07:04.007
A Harlem citizen was just assaulted,
and you're laughing?

07:04.758 --> 07:08.261
Does anybody have a name
on the suspect, huh?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.764
Bailey, I'm surprised at you.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.769
- Look, I was just joking around.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.855
Misty, I mean, you weren't shocked
when Tyson finally lost?

07:19.564 --> 07:20.774
I was five.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.903
Ronda Rousey, then.
You know what Bailey means. Lighten up!

07:25.487 --> 07:26.696
What's the problem?

07:29.032 --> 07:30.075
Back to work.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.913
Detective.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.123
Did you see that tape on Luke Cage?

07:37.207 --> 07:40.460
He got what my father would call
an old-fashioned ass-whooping.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.338
And that doesn't concern you?

07:43.421 --> 07:47.258
He made it clear. He has no use
or desire for police interference.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.513
And we still don't have a lead
on Arturo "Rey" III's murderer.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.265
Meanwhile, Nandi's over here singing
like she's Jennifer Holliday.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.228
Bailey and Nandi just came off
another double homicide.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.481
They can blow off steam and work the case.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.317
I'll tell you this much.

08:04.401 --> 08:08.238
I'm confident if you're out working
on your own on that Rey case,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.365
or anything else freelance,

08:10.448 --> 08:12.659
- you might as well not even come in.
- Mmm.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.288
Where are you going?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.920
Rehab, for my arm.

08:28.133 --> 08:31.720
That's the genius of it all. It looked
like it was all Mark Higgins's idea.

08:31.803 --> 08:36.265
Once properly motivated,
he saw the error of his ways.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.643
Higgins's vote turned the tide
with the board.

08:38.727 --> 08:39.769
The merger went through.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.606
The Atreus stock that you purchased
was practically pennies on the dollar.

08:43.690 --> 08:47.569
Your investment now, on paper,
worth $350 million.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.405
And the more Atreus grows,
the more your money will grow.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.699
Bitch better bring my money.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.492
This is just the beginning.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.871
You are on the precipice
of a whole new world.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.372
How do you feel?

09:00.248 --> 09:01.750
Abuzz with possibility.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.920
Well, congratulations, Madam Councilwoman.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.923
- HRH Mariah.
- Her Royal Highness.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.216
What's next?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.802
Just a few things.
You know, minor details.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.680
Complexities I'm sure you don't want to be
bothered with right now.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.639
Try me.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.601
What's wrong?

09:19.684 --> 09:20.935
Share the love.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.439
You two are sitting here
having drinks at 10:00 a.m.,

09:24.522 --> 09:26.483
talking about money that's invisible.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.110
In my world,
if you can't touch it, it ain't real.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.696
- I'm hearing him.
- Uh...

09:32.447 --> 09:34.407
You don't wanna touch
this money right now.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.118
Neither your street money
from the sales of your gun franchise,

09:37.202 --> 09:38.995
or this new money from your shares.

09:39.079 --> 09:43.374
Your liquid cash is offshore
in the Caymans, where it should be.

09:43.458 --> 09:47.087
Chilling in the shade,
just in case the SEC, the IRS, the ATF,

09:47.170 --> 09:49.089
or any other alphabet boys wanna holler.

09:50.173 --> 09:53.927
Look, you've given me
limited power of attorney to insulate you.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.971
Harlem's Paradise is part of that trust.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.686
You put up the club?

10:04.354 --> 10:07.190
We had to make it look like the club
was collateral for a loan

10:07.273 --> 10:08.983
to invest in Atreus Plastics.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.277
It covers our street money.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.571
We're fine.

10:16.950 --> 10:17.784
Hernan.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.663
Y'all need to check this shit out.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.789
Whoa!

10:26.960 --> 10:28.128
Whoo!

10:28.211 --> 10:31.131
It's a great day in Harlem, baby!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.175
<i>They call me Bushmaster.</i>

10:36.886 --> 10:41.266
Damn! Hate to see such a positive brother
like Luke Cage go down like that,

10:41.349 --> 10:43.601
but as they say, the game is the game.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.645
<i>Everyone hits the canvas eventually.</i>

10:45.728 --> 10:50.817
<i>Ali, Tyson, Frazier, Rousey, De La Hoya.
There's always another predator.</i>

10:50.900 --> 10:52.819
<i>Someone faster. Someone better.</i>

10:52.902 --> 10:57.115
<i>That's the New York state of mind, baby.
Personally, I embrace it.</i>

10:58.700 --> 11:01.411
Luke Cage gets the taste
smacked out of his mouth.

11:01.494 --> 11:05.748
I got it all right here, exclusive.
Look, I love my brother Luke, huh?

11:05.832 --> 11:06.958
We all do.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.420
But this Jamaican cat makes
Diamondback look like Ben Carson.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.423
You gotta see this shit in HD.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.716
Yo...

11:17.135 --> 11:18.553
Yo, I'm sorry, Luke.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.430
Look, I got to make a living.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.765
The video blew up.
ESPN bought it as an exclusive.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.100
You're trending everywhere.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.312
Come on, D.W.
I thought we were cool, man.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.189
What is this, man?

11:30.273 --> 11:32.775
We are. I'm your chronicler.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.778
You think Howard Bingham
put the camera down when Ali lost?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.489
Everybody wants to see the king
get knocked down.

11:38.573 --> 11:41.034
I'm not a king, all right?

11:43.786 --> 11:44.871
I don't...

11:45.705 --> 11:48.374
I don't live my life
for other people's entertainment.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.669
It's public domain, man.
The game is to be sold, not to be told.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.423
Leaving town for a while?

11:56.007 --> 11:57.008
Why?

11:57.759 --> 12:00.303
I saw your girl Claire carrying luggage
outside her mom's place.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.473
I thought you two might be
getting out of Harlem to lay low.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.141
Don't blame you if you do.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.857
Hey, yo! I got that Luke Cage, y'all,
that Jamaican nigga now playing, yo!

12:13.983 --> 12:15.944
- We need to talk.
- About what?

12:18.655 --> 12:21.324
I am not talking with him in here.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.868
He's got my back, just like I have yours.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.835
Let me make one thing crystal clear, Che.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.088
You bust up in my office like that
ever again,

12:35.171 --> 12:38.841
I will cut your balls off
and roll 'em like dice.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.344
You gonna blow on 'em first?

12:49.560 --> 12:51.229
What's so goddamn important?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.648
The guy on TV who laid out Luke Cage

12:53.731 --> 12:57.527
is the same guy that took over
the Yardies. Bushmaster.

12:57.610 --> 13:02.407
You heard what he said on that video,
about his yard? He's talking about Harlem.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.283
He's talking shit.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.787
In one of the bags with money
was Nigel's head.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.831
He's sending a message.

13:09.914 --> 13:14.002
If Bushmaster is capable of taking down
Luke Cage with his bare hands,

13:14.085 --> 13:15.962
what does he need our guns for?

13:16.045 --> 13:17.630
Unless it's to weaken us.

13:17.714 --> 13:22.719
We have $350 million.
We are done with this shit.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.013
What if this shit ain't done with us?

13:25.847 --> 13:29.100
I don't think Bushmaster
is in Harlem for Luke Cage.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.685
I think he's in Harlem for you.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.356
Probably some old beef with Cornell.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.233
No.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.945
No, this goes deeper than Cornell, baby.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.657
I just saw your face
when I said "Bushmaster."

13:46.492 --> 13:47.535
Let me in.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.414
If I don't know everything,
I can't protect you.

13:53.541 --> 13:57.545
Um, I don't know this guy.
I know that name.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.132
It's some old business
with my grandfather.

14:02.216 --> 14:06.095
Let's unload the rest of the gun inventory
and leave it behind us.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.723
We can make a new history...

14:09.557 --> 14:10.558
in Monte Carlo.

14:11.142 --> 14:15.021
Dubrovnik. In Joburg. Anywhere.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.983
No past. Just... Just future from now on.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.989
Do you want to make a future, Hernan?

14:26.157 --> 14:29.410
I would burn in hell for you, Mama.
You know that.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.455
I like you hot.

14:33.581 --> 14:38.294
You save the fire talk for later.
And you can stoke it.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.362
Damn, nigga.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.823
Just saying.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.383
Excuse me. Can I help you?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.220
This is Claire Temple's apartment.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.472
Actually,
it's Claire's mother's apartment.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.724
She's asked me to sublet it.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.601
I'm Luke Cage.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.520
I know who you are.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.314
You're not welcome here
until I hear otherwise.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.941
You're not on the lease.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.903
She left you that.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.936
My apologies for the damage.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.654
Yo!

16:28.738 --> 16:31.073
Guard the Paradise while I'm gone.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.035
When I get back,
we go finish this deal with Bushmaster.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.746
Till then, I need you to watch
Mariah's back for me. All right?

16:38.706 --> 16:40.041
How does it feel, man?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.210
What?

16:42.293 --> 16:45.046
To have your nuts inside Mariah's purse.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.465
Or does she roll 'em like dice?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.161
Jamaica me crazy, huh?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.580
Ha ha.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.003
Bobby Fish told me I'd find you here.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.508
I hate to say this, but you are a victim.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.636
You wanna press charges?
You want him locked up?

17:34.971 --> 17:36.639
Nah. I'll handle it myself.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.099
I knew you'd say that.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.102
What I'm about to show you
could cost me my job.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.938
Yeah? What else is new?

17:48.734 --> 17:52.697
You want to shadow me as I head
to Brooklyn in pursuit of a suspect?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.199
No, you follow me.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.159
But I'll accept the ride.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.203
I met this guy
when I was looking for Nigel.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.163
He's already made a play
on Mariah's arsenal.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.291
You think he pushed Nigel out the way?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.544
Well, now he's on my radar.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.554
Your bag is packed,

18:16.637 --> 18:20.808
you keep staring at that envelope
you just put back in your pocket.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.477
You wanna talk about what happened
with Claire?

18:24.437 --> 18:25.438
No.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.233
Let me guess.

18:29.317 --> 18:33.154
She was pissed about what happened with
Cockroach and how you lost your temper.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.906
Hell, you probably scared her.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.785
There's nothing to be afraid of.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.581
She just has a different idea
of what it is to be a hero.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.335
Sometimes,
you're gonna take the gloves off.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.087
The rules of engagement
exist for a reason.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.716
You used to be a cop. You remember that.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.177
Since when did you change your name
to Iyanla Knight?

18:56.260 --> 18:59.055
Hey, you the one living
out of a bag right now.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.482
Can I... crash at your crib,
for a few nights?

19:10.441 --> 19:11.817
Hell no.

19:23.621 --> 19:24.872
What's with all the gear?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.333
We all ain't bulletproof.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.628
Now, we are just going in there
to observe.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.297
No. I'm going in,
and you're gonna pursue me.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.303
Wow. That was some real Ripley
in <i>Aliens</i> shit.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.682
- I was going for Sarah Connor.
- You're gonna need a bigger sidearm.

19:42.765 --> 19:43.849
They got grenades.

19:48.479 --> 19:51.774
- Is there anything else you wanna tell me?
- No, that about covers it.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.576
Are you sure this is the place?

20:02.660 --> 20:04.704
The Yardies mush've felt the heat
and bounced.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.206
What's that?

20:07.289 --> 20:10.793
Candles, weed. I stopped the party.
I'll tell you that much.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.555
You smell that?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.390
Decomp.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.976
You got PC?

20:28.894 --> 20:29.895
Wait.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.276
I hear voices in distress. Go ahead.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.946
You do have a sworn duty to protect.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.920
- Never gonna get used to that smell.
- Mmm-mmm.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.927
Sweet Christmas.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.180
Shit.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.852
I gotta call this in.

21:09.935 --> 21:14.273
First, I gotta think of a damn good reason
why a Harlem detective and Luke Cage

21:14.356 --> 21:17.401
are standing over a headless body
in Brooklyn.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.529
Just tell them you were following me.

21:21.530 --> 21:25.034
- I'm always blamed for something anyway.
- Works for me.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.286
Wait, won't that get you in trouble?

21:27.369 --> 21:28.454
Eh.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.208
My doghouse is a lot more comfortable
than the one you're in.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.292
TouchÃ©.

21:42.885 --> 21:43.886
What is it?

21:45.221 --> 21:47.306
Alex thought
you might like a coffee.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.559
Just leave it on my desk.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.780
Did you spit in it?

22:07.618 --> 22:09.787
You have something you want to say to me?

22:09.870 --> 22:12.623
Shades told me about the deal
you two got going on with Piranha.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.542
I was thinking maybe I could help.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.253
I read a lot about stocks
when I was inside.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.882
About valuations and risks, the benefits
of a fixed price offer versus tender.

22:21.966 --> 22:25.886
Where prices are negotiable.
You know, shit like that.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.930
You did time with Bernie Madoff?

22:28.889 --> 22:30.808
I'm just saying, Ms. Dillard,

22:31.392 --> 22:33.811
even if you put it in a three-piece suit,

22:34.645 --> 22:36.146
street is still street.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.233
Guys like Piranha move fast,

22:39.316 --> 22:41.443
so you can never really track
what they're doing.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.280
Do you know what he's doing?

22:44.363 --> 22:47.908
He's making more money for me
than anybody in the history of my family.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.414
Well, I'm just saying...

22:54.873 --> 22:57.793
if you can't explain the scam
to a seven-year-old,

22:58.919 --> 23:00.921
you're probably the one getting scammed.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.299
Bye, Comanche.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.759
Right now.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.263
You don't scare me, lady.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.100
I should.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.078
No photographers.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.080
Knight, is that you?

23:35.164 --> 23:36.498
Tomas.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.709
The only time
Harlem's favorite detective calls me

23:38.792 --> 23:39.960
is when she needs me to cover?

23:40.044 --> 23:42.588
Oh, come on.
You know we go deeper than that.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.632
We did.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.301
Listen, Luke, Tomas. Tomas, Luke.

23:47.384 --> 23:51.430
Uh, he and I used to work zombie squad
back in Harlem.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.182
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.808
So, what were you two doing

23:54.892 --> 23:56.977
snooping around an empty warehouse
in my neighborhood?

23:57.061 --> 23:59.855
Last time I was here,
I had an encounter with the Yardies.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.899
The Yardies? You sure about that?

24:01.982 --> 24:03.400
Yeah. Why?

24:03.484 --> 24:04.610
They're old school.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.196
They fought Renkers and Spanglers
and the Shower Posse

24:07.279 --> 24:09.031
for their share
of the drug and gun market.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.491
By the time I got on the job,

24:10.574 --> 24:12.618
we'd dismantled
most of the Yardies' leadership.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.328
So, you think they're inactive?

24:14.411 --> 24:15.996
Far from it. Just quieter.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.706
They don't go by "the Yardies" anymore.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.041
What are they called now?

24:19.124 --> 24:21.752
Last I heard,
they were going by "the Stylers."

24:21.835 --> 24:24.171
No style pon we.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.547
It always changes.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.425
Old versus new crew, a split,
difference of opinion.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.260
But the violence is always the same.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.012
The Stylers a priority now?

24:32.096 --> 24:35.683
That torso we just picked up
comes back as Nigel Garrison, then yeah.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.685
Hopefully,
this stays an internal Styler beef.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.061
The last thing Brooklyn needs now

24:39.144 --> 24:41.313
is a gang civil war
between two Jamaican factions.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.482
Let alone getting into it
with the Haitians, Koreans,

24:43.565 --> 24:44.900
Dominicans or anybody else.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.069
Well, we think this guy
has something to do with it.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.905
Do you know him?

24:51.615 --> 24:53.492
John McIver, yes.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.578
He's a bogeyman. Makes Jamaican bad men
wet the bed at night.

24:56.662 --> 24:57.996
Started off as a baby Styler,

24:58.080 --> 24:59.998
but rose his way up
through the ranks on his own.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.418
- He's the new news.
- What's he doing here?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.503
If he's chopping heads,
he's sending a message.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.547
The Stylers are big time now.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.466
If the Yardies are al-Qaeda,
the Stylers are ISIS.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.135
Give me a sec.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.430
Jesus Christ, Luke,
what have you gotten me into?

25:14.513 --> 25:18.350
Bushmaster isn't just making a play
on Mariah's weapons. He's got other plans.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.312
Hey, hey, you okay?
Do you need to sit down?

25:22.396 --> 25:24.189
I'm fine.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.941
The owner of this warehouse
is Gideon Shaw.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.068
Traffic division picked up a Gideon Shaw
last week

25:28.152 --> 25:29.737
for a busted tail light and gram of weed.

25:29.820 --> 25:30.904
Didn't have papers.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.323
Homeland Security flagged him
for his links to the Stylers.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.200
Have they deported him yet?

25:35.284 --> 25:36.618
Lucky for you, they haven't.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.621
Shaw's being detained
at the ICE facility, Kearny Point.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.790
Well, then we need to speak to him.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.757
You and I can get in there easily.
I don't know about your homeboy.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.426
- Isn't he an ex-con?
- He was framed.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.636
Unless it was expunged,
there's nothing I can do.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.349
He go on a bender or something?

26:00.601 --> 26:03.520
You should go on the Internet
a little more often.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.401
What's going on?

26:09.485 --> 26:11.236
I'm headed to Jersey with Tomas.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.906
I'll go to ICE and see
what I can get out of Shaw.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.116
But you are headed home.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.786
You look punchy as hell.

26:18.869 --> 26:19.912
Fine.

26:19.995 --> 26:23.874
Fine?
What? No epic disagreement?

26:24.958 --> 26:28.337
I'm all talked out.
Thanks for the ride.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.090
Luke.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.969
Don't forget your bag.

26:36.053 --> 26:38.180
You ain't coming to my place for it.

26:42.976 --> 26:46.438
Hey, give Claire some time, okay?

26:47.689 --> 26:49.441
I believe in y'all.

29:38.527 --> 29:42.030
Combining all of these together?

30:29.828 --> 30:30.912
Nightshade.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.961
Can I help you?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.005
I hope so.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.132
You're here for pain reliever.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.385
No.

31:27.511 --> 31:33.850
I was actually wondering if you might have
sold something in one of these recently.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.438
Well, yeah.

31:38.522 --> 31:42.067
Any time I sell dried herbs,
which is many times a day,

31:42.150 --> 31:44.403
I usually bag it up in one of those.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.238
This would have been
to a large Jamaican man.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.198
Those are half my customers.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.080
Can I ask you a question?

31:56.248 --> 31:57.165
Sure.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.709
Do you know
where your strength comes from?

32:01.336 --> 32:06.049
Well, it's a long story,
wrapped up in a lot of baggage.

32:07.175 --> 32:11.847
Sometimes when we unpack baggage
and repack it, it's not as heavy.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.810
Want to give it a try?

32:19.229 --> 32:23.442
Well, I was the subject
of a prison experiment.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.237
The only successful subject.

32:27.320 --> 32:31.950
They were trying to accelerate the healing
of injuries on the battlefield.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.911
What did they do to you?

32:35.412 --> 32:37.247
Put me in a tank full of chemicals.

32:37.831 --> 32:41.585
When I came out, I was stronger.
A lot stronger.

32:42.586 --> 32:46.214
And my skin was tough. Bulletproof tough.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.925
But still smooth.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.179
May I?

33:06.693 --> 33:11.156
That's good for your outsides,
that toughness.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.868
Your skin is soft, like worn-in leather.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.871
But it's what's on the inside
that really matters.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.501
Here.

33:24.211 --> 33:27.214
Drink that down.
It will help with your pain.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.384
It tastes better than it smells.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.977
Liar. Oh, what's in this?

33:41.061 --> 33:44.064
Sweetsop, some kola nut, some basil.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.816
It tastes awful, I'm sorry. But trust me,

33:46.900 --> 33:50.612
it'll take the edge
off of that uppercut you took.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.325
So you saw the video?

33:55.992 --> 33:57.077
Who hasn't?

33:58.453 --> 34:02.374
Like my mother says,
"The ghetto loves a good beatdown."

34:08.420 --> 34:10.840
Everyone gets knocked down.

34:10.924 --> 34:14.177
The only thing that matters
is getting back up.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.847
Sounds like your mother and my father
had the same teachers.

34:23.728 --> 34:24.853
Thanks.

34:26.940 --> 34:32.612
Listen, even though you are who you are,
you might wanna get a MRI.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.072
Is there anyone you can see?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.911
No. Not right now at least.

34:42.956 --> 34:46.458
But this herbal shot
is already doing the trick.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.965
Still not enough
to heal a concussion.

34:55.677 --> 34:58.638
I saw you squinting
the second you walked in here.

34:58.722 --> 35:02.601
One of the most common symptoms
of a concussion is sensitivity to light.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.021
Well, thank you for your time, Miss...

35:07.022 --> 35:08.023
Tilda.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.283
Tilda.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.454
Yeah, I'll definitely remember that.

35:24.414 --> 35:27.334
And if you see that guy again,
be sure to give me a call.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.294
Yes, sir.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.119
Bushmaster. What makes him so scary?

36:04.537 --> 36:06.831
I hope you never have to find out.

36:14.422 --> 36:18.009
This photo was taken last night in Harlem.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.428
Why is he here from Jamaica?

36:22.764 --> 36:24.599
The man on top of the hill.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.770
What?

36:29.646 --> 36:34.401
We grew up together.
Me, John and our bredren, Sheldon.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.696
I'm like an older brother to John-John.

36:37.779 --> 36:43.785
There was an elder, Anansi, a bushman,
who'd always tell John stories.

36:43.868 --> 36:47.205
John would repeat one about two men.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.667
The man on the top of the hill
and the man at the bottom.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.169
The man on top thinks he's better
than the man below.

36:53.253 --> 36:57.048
Why? Because the man at the top,
he doesn't want for anything.

36:57.132 --> 37:00.552
His belly's always full.
His house his own.

37:01.136 --> 37:04.889
He thinks he can't get attacked
because he can see all around.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.684
But that doesn't bother the man
at the bottom of the hill, see?

37:08.852 --> 37:09.686
Why not?

37:10.270 --> 37:12.647
The man at the bottom knows,
at any time he wants,

37:12.731 --> 37:15.483
he can walk up that hill, with his blade,

37:15.567 --> 37:17.819
and cut off the big man's head
while he sleeps.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.613
Why are you telling me this story?

37:23.366 --> 37:26.411
John always talk about his mother
and father being wronged.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.956
Wronged by those Yankees
who think they're superior.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.877
Because they live on the top of the hill.

37:35.920 --> 37:40.091
Bushmaster come back uptown.
Coming for what is his.

37:40.175 --> 37:43.219
He's going to see the family
that live up on Sugar Hill.

37:43.303 --> 37:49.017
He's going to take everything back
that's his. Every bloodclaat thing...

37:49.100 --> 37:51.186
It's like the Bible.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.189
Water destroyed the world last time.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.941
This time... fire.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.219
I would have thought you taller.

39:15.687 --> 39:16.646
Would you like a drink?

39:16.729 --> 39:19.482
Hmm.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.486
I wanna thank you...

39:24.612 --> 39:26.990
doing a public service for Harlem.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.618
It's almost sad to see you
go back to Jamaica.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.620
Or wherever it is you came from.

39:32.704 --> 39:36.165
Harlem is beginning to feel like home.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.043
I think I'll stay a while.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.215
So much craftsmanship
went into this place.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.885
You recently renovate?

39:48.177 --> 39:50.847
We had no choice in the matter,
thanks to Luke Cage.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.056
Yes.

39:52.724 --> 39:56.311
You know who built the bar?
Who designed the interior?

39:56.394 --> 39:57.478
No idea.

39:58.438 --> 40:02.150
My grandfather Buggy
had it commissioned in the late '60s.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.653
- He had a partner?
- Partners.

40:06.237 --> 40:10.658
My grandmother Mabel Stokes
and my Uncle Pete.

40:10.742 --> 40:14.203
Your people ever talk the name
Quincy Purcell McIver?

40:15.622 --> 40:18.750
No. Must not have been that important.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.754
You know,
history remembers queens and kings.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.048
Not the flunkies.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.342
You hear that?

40:28.301 --> 40:29.177
What?

40:29.761 --> 40:31.095
The talkin' blues.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.308
Those are the ancestors you hear.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.686
They remember.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.023
You can't erase the past.

40:43.733 --> 40:45.860
You can't burn it away.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.947
That's the spell on you. That's magic.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.823
Science in its purest form.

40:57.121 --> 41:00.667
- I'm hearing no such thing.
- I think where you're standing...

41:01.459 --> 41:03.628
is the best place to hear the music,
you know.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.505
You can see everything.

41:06.923 --> 41:08.758
You can touch it.

41:10.969 --> 41:11.970
Mmm.

41:12.637 --> 41:16.182
This rum is smooth. Specific.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.393
Bushmaster.

41:19.852 --> 41:23.982
You can't buy it anymore.
It's from a private stock.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.316
Family recipe.

41:26.275 --> 41:29.320
Only two men know
the secret of how to make it.

41:29.404 --> 41:32.156
Both... dead.

41:32.240 --> 41:37.078
Maybe some things are better left dead.
And frozen in the ice.

41:41.290 --> 41:44.335
Old fire stick's easy to light.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.841
Your arms will serve me well.

41:51.426 --> 41:55.179
Pleasure doing business with you,
Ms. Stokes.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.724
"Dillard," bitch.

41:58.725 --> 42:01.519
You call me Stokes
one more goddamn time...

42:04.856 --> 42:07.066
Enjoy your little time on the hill...

42:08.317 --> 42:12.363
'cause life is so precious.
Precarious, too, you know.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.431
Ray Ray, stay with Mariah.

42:38.514 --> 42:40.641
Of course. I'm on her every step.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.186
Where's Comanche? I left him in charge.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.646
His mama called him. Needed something.

42:46.606 --> 42:47.732
Janis called?

43:05.541 --> 43:07.460
Hey.

43:07.543 --> 43:10.046
Yes. Yes, yes!

43:10.129 --> 43:14.092
- Yo! What's up? What's up? What's up?
- Yeah!

43:14.175 --> 43:17.136
- Hello.
- John-John.

43:17.220 --> 43:20.181
- Welcome, bredren.
- Jerome. Man, you aged terrible.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.891
Hey, watch it now.

43:21.974 --> 43:25.144
You took care of Luke Cage
in Harlem like he was nothing.

43:25.228 --> 43:28.147
He says he's faster than Usain Bolt.
You know I had to correct him.

43:28.231 --> 43:31.150
- Strong correction!
- Ooh!

43:31.234 --> 43:33.194
Don't frown. Hey.

43:34.737 --> 43:37.740
How you're back after all this time
and didn't check me?

43:37.824 --> 43:40.868
You know I love you. Come.

43:42.745 --> 43:45.498
What? You're mad, too?

43:45.581 --> 43:48.835
I see you've gone up the hill.

43:48.918 --> 43:55.216
Man, I set foot inside Harlem's Paradise
and I saw my kingdom.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.969
- I even drank Bushmaster.
- Hmm.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.471
See my past, I see my future.

44:01.556 --> 44:03.599
Now that the guard dog is out of the way,

44:04.308 --> 44:06.018
nothing else can stop me now.

44:10.857 --> 44:12.316
Bam!

44:12.400 --> 44:14.610
- I don't need money from you, Nephew.
- Hey.

44:14.694 --> 44:17.822
Don't take nothing, don't ask for nothing
and I stay happy.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.240
I insist.

44:19.323 --> 44:21.200
Speak for yourself, old man.

44:21.284 --> 44:23.619
Lord have mercy.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.873
- More shots of rum.
- Double.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.713
I'm risking my life talking to you.

45:16.297 --> 45:19.675
- You don't have a choice.
- There's only so much I can do.

45:20.259 --> 45:23.387
I can't do this overnight.
Mariah, she doesn't trust me at all.

45:23.471 --> 45:24.931
What about your boy Shades?

45:25.014 --> 45:27.308
It's the same with him, too.
They're connected and shit.

45:27.892 --> 45:32.104
The purpose of you being back on the
streets is to infiltrate that connection,

45:32.188 --> 45:34.065
not give me excuses as to why you can't.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.942
There's only so much I can do.

45:36.901 --> 45:39.195
If I push too hard,
Shades will know somethin' is up.

45:39.820 --> 45:43.783
It's not my problem, brother.
That's a "your problem" kind of thing.

45:44.367 --> 45:48.663
The quicker you give me the information
I need, the quicker I cut you loose.

45:48.746 --> 45:51.082
What's new in the zoo?

46:10.726 --> 46:12.103
It's "Misty."

46:19.068 --> 46:22.029
"There are people who run from the fire

46:22.113 --> 46:24.824
and people who run into it.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.659
Call us when you're ready.

46:26.742 --> 46:29.870
With love, Danny and Colleen."

47:00.026 --> 47:01.360
Okay.

47:32.892 --> 47:35.394
You shouldn't be sneaking up
on people like that.

47:37.438 --> 47:42.401
The shape you're in right now, an elephant
with roller skates could sneak up on you.

47:45.112 --> 47:47.448
You want the good news or the bad news?

47:49.075 --> 47:51.994
I'm not sure I can stomach
any bad news right now.

47:54.663 --> 47:55.664
Well...

47:59.293 --> 48:01.754
the bad news is my daughter's sick.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.091
Kidney problems.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.427
She's all the way in San Diego.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.554
How bad is it?

48:11.680 --> 48:13.641
They say she needs a transplant.

48:15.476 --> 48:18.062
Man, I'm sorry.

48:19.230 --> 48:22.858
I barely know her. She was a baby
when her mother and I split.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.946
But this is somethin' I wanna do.

48:29.406 --> 48:32.785
Well, what's the good news?

48:34.120 --> 48:37.915
Good news is we match.
I can be her donor.

48:39.458 --> 48:40.835
I fly out tomorrow.

48:44.505 --> 48:45.422
Wow.

48:45.506 --> 48:47.633
She called me her hero.

48:47.716 --> 48:48.717
Me.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.305
I ain't gonna front, I lost it.

49:00.396 --> 49:02.773
You must feel like that every day.

49:07.611 --> 49:08.988
I'm happy for you, man.

49:10.739 --> 49:13.576
We all gotta do our own part
in our own way, right?

49:16.078 --> 49:17.246
Yeah.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.461
You talk to Claire?

49:26.797 --> 49:27.882
No.

49:29.633 --> 49:31.427
I'm giving her some space.

49:31.510 --> 49:34.638
I don't think she's the one
that needs the space, brother.

49:36.432 --> 49:39.935
You know, I thought I figured out
how to handle this...

49:41.896 --> 49:44.732
being two Luke Cages.

49:47.818 --> 49:51.113
There's only one problem with that.
There's only one of you.

49:51.697 --> 49:55.826
As long as you're being pulled
in so many different directions, you're...

49:55.910 --> 49:58.078
you're going to lose your temper.

49:58.162 --> 49:59.538
Every man struggles with that.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.416
But I'm not every man.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.210
Precisely my point.

50:04.293 --> 50:06.003
You're a grown-ass man, yes.

50:06.086 --> 50:08.964
But you're also a grown-ass man
who can throw a Volkswagen.

50:10.174 --> 50:13.093
So you have to be more careful
than your average man,

50:13.177 --> 50:17.473
'cause if you lose your shit,
people's lives could be at stake.

50:24.897 --> 50:26.565
Are you sleeping here?

50:28.943 --> 50:29.944
Do you mind?

50:31.946 --> 50:35.991
Ask Pops if it's cool.

50:36.075 --> 50:37.743
He'd tell me to get a hotel.

50:37.826 --> 50:42.748
That's right. That's about the only
good thing about him not being here.

50:43.332 --> 50:46.377
That and not washing that damn window
every morning.

51:00.599 --> 51:02.434
Well, I guess this is it.

51:05.813 --> 51:07.231
For now, anyway.

51:10.651 --> 51:12.361
Luke, if you need anything...

51:12.444 --> 51:15.114
Don't... Don't worry about me, man.

51:17.157 --> 51:18.450
Go be a hero.

51:21.996 --> 51:23.622
Right back at you, brother.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.530
We're closed, man.

51:56.613 --> 51:58.699
I'm sorry. Are you Carl Lucas?

52:05.122 --> 52:06.332
Who's asking?

52:06.415 --> 52:10.044
Mr. Lucas, I'm a process server with
the Superior Court of New York County.

52:10.711 --> 52:12.004
You've been served.
