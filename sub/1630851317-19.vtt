<i>Previously on</i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:05.309 --> 00:06.919
Sorry, it should work.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.051
I put money on it yesterday.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.662
- Don't worry about it.
- I have cash.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.186
Relax. It's on me.

00:12.229 --> 00:15.058
- Olivia.
- Douglas.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.365
Maybe it's time
we go on a real date.

00:17.408 --> 00:20.063
You mean off the bus?

00:20.107 --> 00:21.456
I do.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.327
- I'd like that.
- So would I.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.981
- Then we should.
- Why don't we?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.722
I'm pretty sure we are.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.378
<i>Hey, Mom.</i><i>There she is.</i>

00:30.421 --> 00:32.728
Mommy.

00:32.771 --> 00:33.903
What do you want?

00:33.946 --> 00:36.601
Well, first of all,
let me just say

00:36.645 --> 00:38.342
we love you very much.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.605
Uh-huh.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.129
And in the spirit
of that love, we have

00:42.172 --> 00:44.566
something very important
we need to talk to you about.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.220
So this is how it happens, huh?

00:46.263 --> 00:47.960
How what happens?

00:48.004 --> 00:49.223
If I'm going to
a nursing home,

00:49.266 --> 00:51.529
I'm taking your kneecaps
with me.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.576
That's not what
this is about.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.230
You taking my booze?

00:56.273 --> 00:57.535
No.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.407
Well, then, what can I
do for you, sweethearts?

01:01.539 --> 01:02.584
My girlfriend...

01:02.627 --> 01:04.629
- The Mexican?
- Yes,

01:04.673 --> 01:06.457
she happens to be Mexican...

01:06.501 --> 01:08.459
wants to meet my family.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.244
Oh, that's great.

01:10.287 --> 01:14.074
I've been looking forward
to meeting your little señorita.

01:14.117 --> 01:17.512
Okay, I'm gonna
- stop you right there.
- What?

01:17.555 --> 01:18.991
Just call her Olivia.

01:19.035 --> 01:21.298
Not "the Mexican,"
not "señorita."

01:23.996 --> 01:26.738
So I take the time
to speak her language,

01:26.782 --> 01:29.611
and this is the gracias I get?

01:29.654 --> 01:33.223
Okay, this is a list
of all the things

01:33.267 --> 01:36.313
I am begging you
not to do or say.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.142
"Don't compliment her English
or marvel at her olive skin."

01:42.667 --> 01:45.366
Is this that "woke" crap?

01:45.409 --> 01:48.195
No, it's common courtesy crap.

01:48.238 --> 01:51.415
- But it is crap?
- No.

01:51.459 --> 01:52.634
Okay, there is
no need for you

01:52.677 --> 01:54.897
to point out your
differences with people.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.725
Then what the hell
are we gonna talk about?

01:56.768 --> 01:58.161
Good instinct.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.858
Maybe don't talk at all.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.991
- You're ashamed of me.
- No.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.645
- Of course not.
- A little bit.

02:03.688 --> 02:07.214
This girl is really
important to Douglas,

02:07.257 --> 02:09.259
and we just want to
make a good impression.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.434
Speaking of which.

02:14.264 --> 02:17.789
"Olivia is not your friend
or your soul sister.

02:17.833 --> 02:21.141
You do not get her struggle."

02:21.184 --> 02:22.925
You don't know that.

02:22.968 --> 02:25.623
I do, so don'’t.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.495
Guys, this is not hard.
We can be on

02:27.538 --> 02:29.279
our best behavior for one night.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.890
Oh, come on.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.438
It's a Nigerian name.
A little tricky.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.004
Repeat after me:

02:59.048 --> 03:01.529
A-bi-sho-la.

03:01.572 --> 03:02.791
Abishola.

03:02.834 --> 03:05.924
First try. Good for you.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.622
I kept calling her
"Assi-Hola."

03:08.666 --> 03:10.059
I know.

03:10.102 --> 03:12.017
How did she meet Bob?

03:12.061 --> 03:13.671
Oh, that's a good story.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.979
He had a heart attack
and she was his cardiac nurse.

03:17.022 --> 03:19.242
Ah, cute. So they fell in love
in the hospital?

03:19.286 --> 03:21.723
No. There was a little stalking.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.595
But it was cute.

03:24.639 --> 03:28.164
So, my mom had a stroke.
She's fine.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.166
Abishola took care of her
while dating my brother

03:30.210 --> 03:33.169
- at the same time.
- You're making this up.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.736
I know. It's ridiculous.

03:34.779 --> 03:37.956
Now my mom lives with them.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.916
Then, after they got married,
Her mom moved in, too.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.309
- Abishola's mom?
- Yeah.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.832
We call her Mama Ebun.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.877
That name I nailed right away.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.315
So that's everybody?

03:48.358 --> 03:50.534
Well, there's also Dele,
Abishola's son

03:50.578 --> 03:52.754
from her first marriage
to Tayo.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.669
And Olu and Tunde
might be there, too.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.148
Olu and Tunde?

03:56.192 --> 03:57.933
- Abishola's aunt and uncle.
- Do they live with them?

03:57.976 --> 03:59.804
Not yet.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.116
Hey, everybody.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.857
Hey!

04:08.900 --> 04:09.988
Hello.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.425
Hi, I'm Bob, Douglas' brother.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.817
It's nice to finally meet you.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.255
- And you must be Abishola.
- I am.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.213
- You have a lovely smile.
- Thank you.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.954
Douglas said to smile more

04:18.997 --> 04:21.826
because my resting face
is a bitch.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.438
- That's not exactly what I said.
- All right, out of the way.

04:24.481 --> 04:27.092
I want to meet the gal

04:27.136 --> 04:29.573
who stole my little boy's heart.

04:29.617 --> 04:30.879
This is my mom.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.707
- Hello, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Hi.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.493
I've been instructed
not to say anything else.

04:38.365 --> 04:41.281
Olivia, I am Abishola's mother.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.108
Welcome to my home.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.199
Brought some wine.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.463
Wow. And it's not half empty.

04:49.506 --> 04:52.074
Good for you. Hi.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.641
I'm Christina,
his twin sister.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.296
Hi. I love those earrings.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.949
Oh, gosh. Thank you.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.386
Uh, you know what,
I got them at this wonderful

04:59.429 --> 05:01.736
woman-owned boutique.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.738
We could maybe
get some lunch

05:03.781 --> 05:06.131
and do a little shopping.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.872
Or not.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.008
I am Tunde.

05:13.051 --> 05:15.097
This is my wife Olu.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.404
We looked at all
your Instagram posts,

05:17.447 --> 05:19.797
and you are hashtag lovely.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.799
Hashtag thank you.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.889
Hi, I'm Dele,
Abishola's son.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.152
Oh, you're the one
that wants to become

05:27.196 --> 05:29.285
a choreographer,
but I hear it's not

05:29.329 --> 05:30.373
one of the approved options.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.289
That's me.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.902
Mmm. This is wonderful.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.426
I've never had Nigerian
food before.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.253
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

05:41.297 --> 05:44.518
Usually, the jollof
has more flavor.

05:44.561 --> 05:48.304
I did what I could with
Abishola's barren spice cabinet.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.351
Olivia's been teaching me
how to cook.

05:51.394 --> 05:54.179
All I knew how to make
was grilled cheese.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.312
Your smoke alarm says
you can't make that either.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.011
Hey, I taught you
a few things in the kitchen.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.404
Yeah, how to yell at the maid.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.670
I believe it is our job
as women to help bring out

06:06.714 --> 06:08.106
the best in our men.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.934
You mean housebreak them?

06:09.978 --> 06:12.328
- Oh, like a stray dog.
- Woof!

06:15.157 --> 06:16.898
Bob used to floss at the table
after meals.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.334
- Mm.
- Oh.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.032
And now I do it over the trash,
like a gentleman.

06:21.076 --> 06:24.471
Yes, men are rough
around the edges

06:24.514 --> 06:28.997
until we find the right woman
who can sand us down.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.086
Well, I'm gonna be
sanding for a while.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.395
Did you know that he
only has paper plates

06:35.438 --> 06:37.832
that he wipes off and reuses?

06:39.224 --> 06:40.704
I really am useless.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.619
He didn't even own a vacuum.

06:42.663 --> 06:43.838
I thought he had rats,

06:43.881 --> 06:44.926
but they were just
massive dust bunnies.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.103
I'm disgusting.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.322
I mean, seriously,
who raised you?

06:50.366 --> 06:52.803
I did, señorita!

06:55.893 --> 06:57.939
Have some more wine, Mom.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.599
Okay, everything looks good,
Mrs. Johnson.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.339
We recommend you rest
for the evening,

07:07.383 --> 07:08.906
and we will reevaluate
in the morning.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.734
Uh-uh. I want to leave now.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.475
And I wanted you to leave yesterday.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.651
Excuse me?

07:14.695 --> 07:18.046
What she means is although
your procedure was minor,

07:18.089 --> 07:20.222
it's always better
to exercise caution.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.615
I know my body.

07:21.658 --> 07:25.183
I know it, too. You never
close your damn robe.

07:25.227 --> 07:28.578
I want to speak to
your supervisor.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.928
You are speaking to her, and I
say keep your ass in that bed.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.673
I'm sorry. She should never
have said those things to you.

07:36.717 --> 07:40.372
Even if everything
she said was correct.

07:40.416 --> 07:43.463
- What are you doing?
- My job.

07:43.506 --> 07:46.030
You cannot speak to
the patients like that.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.293
I know. Sorry.
It's just

07:48.337 --> 07:51.253
some stuff going on at home.

07:51.296 --> 07:54.256
Oh. That makes sense.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.823
Okay.

07:55.866 --> 07:58.434
Are you not even gonna ask?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.827
Ask what?

07:59.870 --> 08:02.133
I just told you something's
going on at home.

08:02.177 --> 08:05.615
Yes, and you seem
quite upset about it.

08:05.659 --> 08:06.964
I don'’t want to pry.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.967
But I want you to pry.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.534
Where are you going?

08:11.578 --> 08:14.406
Get in your damn room.

08:17.235 --> 08:20.369
It was so nice to meet
Douglas' girlfriend.

08:20.412 --> 08:21.370
She's lovely.

08:21.413 --> 08:24.025
Uh-huh.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.417
And so funny.

08:25.461 --> 08:27.550
Yeah, a real chucklehead.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.769
You did not like her?

08:28.812 --> 08:31.728
She didn't like me.
You heard her.

08:31.772 --> 08:34.078
"I had to teach Douglas
how to cook.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.297
I had to teach him
how to clean."

08:36.603 --> 08:38.822
Who do you think
- that looks bad on?
- You.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.084
Exactly.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.825
You are right
to be upset, Dottie.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.392
This girl needs to know that

08:43.435 --> 08:46.090
a boy's mother
comes first, always.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.484
- So I'm not crazy.
- Not at all.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.444
Just bear in mind who is
telling you you're not crazy.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.229
What does that mean?

08:55.491 --> 08:58.581
That means I drank some schnapps
before I came here

08:58.625 --> 09:01.758
and thought I was saying that
in my head.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.036
What was that?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.865
My retirement calendar.

09:21.909 --> 09:22.866
Why?

09:22.910 --> 09:25.521
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.959
Unbelievable.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.092
What is new
in the ICU?

09:31.135 --> 09:33.268
Gloria threw out
her retirement calendar.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.704
Because she's not retiring?

09:34.748 --> 09:35.792
I don't know. I don't think

09:35.836 --> 09:36.837
she wants to talk about it.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.012
Yes, I want to talk about it.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.015
I can't retire because

09:41.058 --> 09:43.800
my idiot husband
blew our whole nest egg.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.194
Oh, no.

09:46.237 --> 09:49.806
Was it drugs? Gambling.
Prostitutes?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.765
He spent it on our kids.

09:51.808 --> 09:54.245
Mm, that is boring.

09:54.289 --> 09:57.161
My son needed money
for a vegan food truck.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.599
In Detroit?
Why would he do that?

09:59.642 --> 10:01.644
Yes, that's a terrible
- investment.
- I know.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.907
Then he just had to pay
for my daughter's

10:03.951 --> 10:05.866
dream wedding in Hawaii.

10:05.909 --> 10:08.564
And now he's paying
the legal bills for her divorce.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.348
Oh, no.

10:10.392 --> 10:14.004
Was it drugs? Gambling.
Prostitutes?

10:14.048 --> 10:16.441
No, they just fell out of love.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.530
That is
still boring.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.358
What should your husband
have done?

10:20.402 --> 10:21.969
We are supposed
to support our children.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.971
We were supposed
to buy an RV

10:24.014 --> 10:25.712
and travel around the country.

10:25.755 --> 10:28.236
Your retirement plan

10:28.279 --> 10:31.369
was to live in a van?

10:31.413 --> 10:33.415
Not a van, an RV.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.939
With a bed,
a kitchen, a bathroom.

10:35.983 --> 10:39.987
You drive your bathroom
around with you?

10:40.030 --> 10:43.294
Like a porta potty on wheels.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.948
If she brakes too hard,
she will slosh doo-doo water

10:44.992 --> 10:46.689
right into her kitchen.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.778
Just forget it.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.084
Oh...

10:52.521 --> 10:53.740
She seems really upset.

10:55.089 --> 10:58.048
She's so lucky to have
good friends like us to talk to.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.016
Mrs. Wheeler?

11:09.059 --> 11:12.759
Oh, hello.
What a coincidence.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.978
I didn't figure you
as a bus rider.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.938
Oh, sure. I'm all about
public transportation.

11:17.981 --> 11:22.203
I like to get in close
where you can smell the people.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.771
- Where are you headed?
- Nowhere in particular.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.860
I just enjoy seeing Detroit

11:26.903 --> 11:29.950
on a rainy, dreary day.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.953
Okay.

11:39.350 --> 11:42.745
Look at you,
driving this big beast.

11:42.789 --> 11:43.964
She handles pretty well.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.530
I'm impressed.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.620
I'd be mowing down pedestrians
left and right.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.971
There wouldn't be one
skateboarder left in Detroit.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.410
I got to tell you,

11:55.453 --> 11:57.368
I've never seen Douglas happier.

11:57.412 --> 12:00.023
- And that's all 'cause of you.
- I'm glad.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.634
So that's how you feel,
that it's all 'cause of you?

12:02.678 --> 12:04.506
Excuse me?

12:04.549 --> 12:06.247
Never mind.
Focus on your driving.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.686
You know he's my baby, right?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.861
Isn't he a twin?

12:11.905 --> 12:14.168
Yes, but he was born last.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.518
He loved me so much
the doctors had to

12:16.561 --> 12:19.739
pull him out of my hoo-ha
kicking and screaming.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.045
You draw quite the picture.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.526
I just want you to know
what you're getting into.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.876
He's a good man,

12:26.920 --> 12:28.660
but he's also a mama's boy.

12:28.704 --> 12:29.792
For now.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.142
Forever.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.587
You wanted to see us?

12:42.631 --> 12:44.198
Yeah. Sit down.

12:44.241 --> 12:47.244
I want to talk to you
about something.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.597
So, what is up?

12:52.641 --> 12:54.817
We got any Mexicans
working in the warehouse?

12:54.861 --> 12:57.820
I believe Hector is Mexican.
Why?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.909
Well, remember when Bob
started dating Abishola,

12:59.953 --> 13:02.782
and I came to you guys
about advice on Nigerian stuff?

13:02.825 --> 13:06.698
Yes. That was the first time
you ever spoke to us.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.004
Yeah, well, I need to do
the same sort of thing,

13:08.048 --> 13:11.007
except, you know, Mexican.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.531
What is wrong with you?

13:13.575 --> 13:15.490
You're gonna have to
be more specific.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.145
What were you thinking
getting on her bus?

13:18.188 --> 13:20.103
That I love my son.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.497
- She's very upset.
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.152
Give me her number
and I'll call and apologize.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.286
No.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.072
You're right.
A call is too impersonal.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.682
I got her bus schedule.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.250
Stay away from her!

13:41.124 --> 13:44.171
Do you still
want to talk to Hector?

13:47.957 --> 13:49.872
Where's the mean nurse?

13:49.916 --> 13:52.092
I'm right here.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.920
No, the little one.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.878
She get fired?

13:55.922 --> 13:58.141
If you mean Nurse Gloria,

13:58.185 --> 13:59.577
she's taking a personal day.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.362
She's dealing with
some things at home.

14:01.405 --> 14:04.931
Her husband leaving her?
Hope so.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.846
You know nothing about her.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.413
Gloria is the hardest-working
nurse here.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.850
And usually very kind.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.200
- If you say so.
- I do say so.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.766
She's my friend.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.594
Then you need to find
better friends.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.770
And you need to stop whining

14:18.814 --> 14:20.947
and keep your ass in this bed.

14:20.990 --> 14:24.124
I take it back.
You're the mean one.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.952
I already told you that.

14:27.214 --> 14:30.043
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.915
Hey, listen, can I circle
back with you on Monday?

14:32.959 --> 14:35.657
Uh-huh.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.747
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.881
Uh-huh.

14:44.927 --> 14:48.626
Listen, I got to go.
Something's up with my mother.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.499
- Oh, God, what did she do?
- Mom's trying to

14:51.542 --> 14:54.067
get between me and Olivia and I
have to find a way to stop her.

14:54.110 --> 14:57.766
Douglas, first of all,
violence is never the answer.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.856
I didn't think it was.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.640
Oh, yeah, sorry,

15:02.684 --> 15:05.295
It's just where my mind goes.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.124
Wait, why are you coming to
me for relationship advice?

15:08.168 --> 15:09.604
You know I'm a mess.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.954
I can't go to Bob.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.914
He's only had two girlfriends
- and he married both of them.
- Well,

15:14.957 --> 15:17.003
whereas I've had 22 boyfriends

15:17.046 --> 15:19.309
and Mom scared them all away.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.442
It wasn't all Mom.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.878
Do you want my help or not?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.314
Sorry.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.709
What do I do?
What did you do?

15:27.752 --> 15:29.929
I gave up on men and got a cat.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.367
I hate cats.
Come on.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.934
You must have learned something.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.371
Fine.

15:37.414 --> 15:41.114
The mistake I made
was wanting Mom's approval.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.899
- I do the same thing.
- See? And you're never

15:43.943 --> 15:47.294
gonna get it, because she can
find a flaw in anybody.

15:47.337 --> 15:50.862
"Why are you dating him?
He's too old. He's too short.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.430
He just got out of prison
for involuntary manslaughter."

15:53.474 --> 15:55.084
You can't win.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.348
Yeah, but how do I fix this?

15:58.392 --> 15:59.959
Douglas,

16:00.002 --> 16:03.223
if you love this girl,
you have to fight for her.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.876
If I would have done that,

16:04.920 --> 16:06.269
Robert wouldn't have
killed again

16:06.313 --> 16:08.097
because he would have
had love in his life.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.101
Wait, the second time
wasn't involuntary?

16:13.102 --> 16:15.061
No.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.150
And that's on Mom.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.897
Hello.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.247
What are y'all doing here?

16:27.290 --> 16:29.423
- Frank let us in.
- Who?

16:29.466 --> 16:32.774
- Your husband.
- My husband's name is Lester.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.732
Well, he obviously
doesn't know his name

16:34.776 --> 16:36.952
because he didn't correct me
when I called him Frank.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.476
I made you a pie.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.652
Why?

16:41.696 --> 16:45.439
I was told in America, when
someone dies, you bring food.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.093
And your dream died,
so it seemed like

16:47.136 --> 16:48.398
the Christian thing to do.

16:48.442 --> 16:51.010
Thank you.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.230
We are ready to listen,
and we will not judge.

16:54.274 --> 16:55.579
Well, we will judge,

16:55.623 --> 16:58.365
but we'll keep it
to ourselves.

16:58.408 --> 17:01.324
I might have been overreacting.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.544
Yes, but your feelings
are valid.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.460
My what are what now?

17:06.503 --> 17:08.897
Something Bob always says.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.856
I do not understand it,
but it sounds nice.

17:11.900 --> 17:15.904
I just feel like
I've been running a marathon.

17:15.947 --> 17:18.080
And now, suddenly,
I'm almost done with the race,

17:18.124 --> 17:20.082
and the finish line
keeps getting pushed back

17:20.126 --> 17:21.257
further and further.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.867
Hmm.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.957
Do you have whipped
cream for the pie?

17:26.001 --> 17:27.046
No.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.743
Mm.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.789
I always thought
as soon as my kids are grown

17:31.833 --> 17:34.879
and out, then I'll start
living my life for me.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.968
Mm.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.580
Maybe ice cream?
A la mode?

17:39.623 --> 17:40.363
Sorry.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.846
Don-Don't get me wrong.
I love my kids.

17:44.889 --> 17:48.371
But it's been 30 years
and I'm still here,

17:48.415 --> 17:50.112
living my life
for everybody else.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.724
You might be here now, but
you will not be here forever.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.901
Mm. Soon you will drive
that portable toilet

17:56.945 --> 17:58.468
all across America.

18:00.253 --> 18:03.517
I just hope I'm still
healthy enough to enjoy it.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.955
It's good you have a dream.

18:06.998 --> 18:10.001
You got dreams, too.
You gonna be a doctor.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.178
One day.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.789
That's the very stuff
dreams are made of, honey.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.312
One day.

18:16.356 --> 18:19.402
- Mm.
- I would like to start a catering business.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.665
Good for you.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.624
- One day.
- Yeah, now you're getting it.

18:26.279 --> 18:29.151
Can I tell you something without
you getting angry with me?

18:29.195 --> 18:30.587
Of course.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.810
I'm sorry that you
have to keep working.

18:35.853 --> 18:38.552
But I would miss you terribly
if you left.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.383
Why would that make me angry?

18:43.426 --> 18:45.167
It's selfish.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.865
I love it.

18:50.216 --> 18:54.089
Frank, can you run out and
get us some Haäagen-Dazs?

19:03.098 --> 19:04.099
<i>And I just want you to know</i>

19:04.143 --> 19:05.318
<i>I'm my own man.</i>

19:05.361 --> 19:06.928
My mother does not run my life

19:06.971 --> 19:09.017
anymore.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.149
Does she know that?

19:10.192 --> 19:11.802
What do you mean?

19:13.064 --> 19:15.545
Hey, guys. <i>¿Que pasa?</i>

19:17.547 --> 19:18.766
What are you doing?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.376
I love you
and I don't want to get a cat.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.508
Open the door!

19:21.551 --> 19:23.640
Did you just say
you love me?

19:23.684 --> 19:26.121
I did, because I do.
I r-really do.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.168
And I know it's kind of fast,

19:29.211 --> 19:30.299
but I've never met
anyone like you.

19:30.343 --> 19:33.911
I know you can hear me.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.652
I love you, too.

19:35.696 --> 19:40.353
You got to let me on.
I pay my taxes!

19:40.396 --> 19:42.790
- Drive.
- You sure?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.574
Floor it.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.446
Douglas!

19:47.447 --> 19:49.144
Douglas!

19:49.188 --> 19:51.668
You'll pay for this!
