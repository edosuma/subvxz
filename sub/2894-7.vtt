00:00.566 --> 00:02.467
(people screaming)

00:08.308 --> 00:09.708
Iron man: Jarvis, hurry up.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.543
Sounds like we're
missing the party.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.356
Jarvis:  <i>A tight cluster</i>
<i>of meteors entering</i>
<i>earth's atmosphere</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:26.892
<i>At 200.7 miles per hour.</i>

00:26.894 --> 00:28.960
<i>Heading straight for</i>
<i>the eastern seaboard.</i>

00:28.962 --> 00:31.697
Iron man: How large a cluster
are we talking about, here?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.365
<i>According to scans,</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:35.634
<i>An explosion in the</i>
<i>x-36 star quadrant.</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:37.035
<i>A planet, sir.</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:38.770
Avengers, assemble!

00:44.043 --> 00:45.610
Thor, you're up.

00:45.612 --> 00:46.611
Hmm. (grunts)

00:50.583 --> 00:54.453
(chuckles)
stones from the sky,
hardly a challenge.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.121
Hulk: Then sit
down, butterscotch.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.789
Leaves more
for me to smash!

00:57.791 --> 00:58.957
(roars)

01:02.595 --> 01:03.762
(grunts)

01:07.734 --> 01:08.800
(grunts)

01:10.036 --> 01:11.603
Well, that's
using your head.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.772
(groans)
not funny.

01:16.676 --> 01:18.377
Looks like you can use
some backup, hawkeye.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.091
You missed one.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.462
(grunts)

01:37.464 --> 01:40.866
Yep, didn't think
that through! Help!

01:40.868 --> 01:42.968
Falcon: Go limp.
This is gonna hurt!

01:43.836 --> 01:44.903
What?

01:46.839 --> 01:47.706
Ugh!

01:51.077 --> 01:52.577
You call
that a save?

02:02.455 --> 02:04.156
You call that
a thank you?

02:04.158 --> 02:07.793
Everybody thinks
they're a hero.

02:07.795 --> 02:08.960
Might as well
just sit back and...

02:08.961 --> 02:10.095
Huh?
Huh?

02:19.071 --> 02:20.972
Jarvis:  <i>Warning,</i>
<i>a designate</i>
<i>class-z meteorite</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:22.974
<i>Has just entered</i>
<i>the atmosphere.</i>

02:22.976 --> 02:25.710
<i>An "earth killer," sir.</i>

02:25.712 --> 02:27.846
"earth killer"?

02:27.848 --> 02:30.549
There's two words I never
wanted to hear together.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.583
(grunts)

02:33.019 --> 02:34.519
Iron man: Avengers, go!

02:35.154 --> 02:36.221
(yells)

02:46.599 --> 02:49.701
Keep at it!
Give it everything
you've got!

02:49.703 --> 02:52.971
Hulk, smash!
Like you've never
smashed before!

02:52.973 --> 02:54.506
(growls)

02:58.711 --> 03:00.545
Iron man: We
can't let it hit!

03:00.547 --> 03:02.581
There's gotta
be a way!

03:02.583 --> 03:03.782
(roars)

03:11.591 --> 03:12.757
(grunting)

03:13.726 --> 03:15.160
Sorry, guys.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.696
This one's just too big.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.130
If only we had more power.

03:25.571 --> 03:26.938
Been nice working
with you all.

03:43.155 --> 03:45.257
Iron man:
Something's killing
this earth killer.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.691
Jarvis?

03:46.693 --> 03:48.226
Jarvis:  <i>Scanning.</i>

04:01.541 --> 04:03.275
Iron man: What
just happened?

04:06.012 --> 04:08.079
Stark, is this
your doing?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.148
Not on my best day.

04:10.150 --> 04:13.618
We've got
company. Look.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.253
Captain america:
I don't think he's
from around here.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.096
Did that dude
just wink at me?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.264
Yup.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.668
Looks like we got
a new contender

04:29.670 --> 04:31.570
To the title
"earth's mightiest hero."

04:31.572 --> 04:33.204
Calls himself hyperion.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.308
A touch grandiose,
even by my standards.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.644
On the contrary,
he seems quite impressive.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.212
I've been analyzing
this guy for weeks.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.681
His power rating's
off the charts.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.783
Heat vision,
invulnerability.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.685
Super-strength, flight.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.788
(groans) just another
pretty boy in a cape to me.

04:51.924 --> 04:54.826
Wonder how his aim is.

04:54.828 --> 04:58.096
He diced a meteor the
size of the grand canyon
into cheese cubes.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.631
I'd say accurate.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.200
I say it's time
for a face-to-face.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.703
After that near-miss
with the meteorite,

05:04.705 --> 05:06.838
Yeah, pretty obvious
we could use someone
like him on the team.

05:06.840 --> 05:11.276
You like him 'cause
he winked at you.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.279
What makes any
of you think he wants
to be an avenger?

05:14.281 --> 05:18.316
Has anyone stopped
to think about what
motivates this hyperion?

05:18.318 --> 05:21.119
Some people hear the call
to help where they can.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.754
There should always
be an ideal, widow.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.290
Agreed, but,
on the other hand,

05:25.292 --> 05:27.225
Who tells the man
who saved the world

05:27.227 --> 05:29.361
Without breaking
a sweat, "no"?

05:30.396 --> 05:32.664
(groans)

05:32.666 --> 05:34.799
You just got
wrecked by the...

05:34.801 --> 05:37.102
Iron man: Wrecker?
Where's your wrecking crew?

05:37.104 --> 05:38.970
Back off, avengers,

05:38.972 --> 05:40.639
Or you're gonna see
more than double

05:40.641 --> 05:42.073
When I'm finished with you.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.276
Captain america: Hyperion!

05:50.950 --> 05:52.250
(groans)

05:54.253 --> 05:56.021
Wait, there are
people inside!

05:56.023 --> 05:57.922
Oh, get out of here!
Ahh! Let's go!

05:57.924 --> 06:00.058
(indistinct shouting)

06:00.060 --> 06:02.027
Hyperion: This is
your final warning!

06:02.029 --> 06:03.228
Surrender!

06:03.230 --> 06:06.264
Or next time,
I won't miss!

06:07.233 --> 06:09.200
Thanks for
the assist, gents.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.136
(whimpers)

06:11.138 --> 06:12.437
Stop!
We need to talk,
we need...

06:14.907 --> 06:17.108
<i>A new hero</i>
<i>for a new day!</i>

06:17.110 --> 06:20.078
<i>With crime on a sharp decle</i>
<i>since his appearance,</i>

06:20.080 --> 06:23.782
<i>Hyperion's methods</i>
<i>of justice may be just</i>
<i>what this world needs.</i>

06:23.784 --> 06:24.749
What?

06:26.252 --> 06:27.986
Ugh.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.188
I'd hate to be
on the other end
of that grunt.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.358
Let's just say speaking
with this hyperion
has become a priority.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.161
Any word on...
I got it!
I got his position.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.330
Hyperion shares the
same energy signature
as those meteorite dice.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.433
All I had to do
was triangulate the
frequencies and...

06:41.435 --> 06:44.002
No more babble.
Where is hyperion?

06:44.004 --> 06:45.236
(rumbling)

06:45.238 --> 06:46.404
Upstairs?

06:49.341 --> 06:51.443
Way upstairs.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.019
Falcon: Wow!

07:01.021 --> 07:02.921
Hawkeye:
Should we be jealous
that his clubhouse

07:02.923 --> 07:04.322
Blows our clubhouse
out of the water?

07:10.763 --> 07:11.896
Show-off.

07:12.798 --> 07:15.333
Ah, the avengers!

07:15.335 --> 07:19.037
Welcome, I'm hyperion. Hi!

07:19.039 --> 07:21.072
Hi? Seriously?

07:25.211 --> 07:27.846
You have to wonder about
his decorating skills.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.781
Hyperion: You mean
the statue?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.483
I can see why you'd
think it's funny,

07:31.485 --> 07:34.385
But I find that image
is really important.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.521
It's all about
first impressions.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.189
Striking fear into
the hearts of villains

07:38.191 --> 07:40.325
Before I even
throw a punch.

07:40.327 --> 07:43.461
Your scans missed one,
sam. Super-hearing.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.998
I cannot tell you
how pleased I am
to finally meet you all.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.801
I have been admiring
you all from afar.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.403
Your abilities are
impressive and wide-ranged.

07:52.405 --> 07:56.007
Stealth, technology,
unbridled strength.

07:56.009 --> 08:00.044
I mean, there's
a reason they call you
"earth's mightiest heroes."

08:00.046 --> 08:01.913
You've been studying us?

08:01.915 --> 08:05.350
You've been studying
me too, right?
It makes sense.

08:05.352 --> 08:08.953
I wanted to know what
I was dealing with
before I made contact.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.222
Needless to say,
I was very impressed.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.925
Can't say the same,
not yet.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.361
Oh, I'm sorry, why?

08:16.363 --> 08:18.496
Simply put, your
methods are severe.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.099
Your power makes
some people nervous.

08:21.101 --> 08:24.135
By "people," do you
mean the avengers?

08:24.137 --> 08:25.403
Surely not.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.840
(chuckles) I think
what cap is saying is...

08:28.842 --> 08:30.375
We just wanna know
who you are.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.811
Ah, my origin.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.246
(sighs)

08:35.248 --> 08:37.482
I'm afraid it's
not a happy one.

08:37.484 --> 08:41.251
Quagmire, display file e-712.

08:46.258 --> 08:49.093
We so need this wall.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.396
On my planet, life was
far different from yours.

08:53.132 --> 08:56.201
However, it had
the same challenges.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.169
Villainy, corruption, and war

08:58.171 --> 09:01.339
Had grown like a cancer
on the soul of my world.

09:01.341 --> 09:04.242
I tried my hardest
to carve it out,

09:04.244 --> 09:06.211
But, sadly, I failed.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.182
In the end,
the corrupt people
of my world

09:11.184 --> 09:13.618
Wound up
destroying themselves.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.088
There was nothing
I could do.
I barely escaped.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.058
So you're an alien,
the last of your kind,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.360
With both amazing powers
and super-intellect?

09:22.928 --> 09:24.095
Indeed.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.930
Wow.

09:25.932 --> 09:29.167
That's another one
you missed, sam.
You're slipping.

09:29.169 --> 09:32.136
All that remains
of my home is
in this citadel.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.905
With this technology,

09:33.907 --> 09:37.008
I will use its advancements
to save your planet.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.110
Nice cape.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.345
Save our planet?

09:41.647 --> 09:43.314
(distant screams)

09:45.484 --> 09:47.118
Hold that thought, captain.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.621
Some people don't learn
from their mistakes.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.489
Make yourselves at home,
I'll be right back.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.596
I'm not trying to escape!
It wasn't me.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.331
You can't prove nothing.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.968
Silence!

10:03.970 --> 10:06.971
You had a chance at
rehabilitation, villain.

10:06.973 --> 10:10.308
You're a stain
on this planet's face
that I shall wipe off.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.611
Iron man: No! Ahh!

10:20.920 --> 10:22.954
I hate days like this!

10:24.223 --> 10:25.456
Ahh!

10:26.625 --> 10:29.928
Ah!

10:29.930 --> 10:31.162
<i>You're welcome.</i>

10:34.099 --> 10:36.401
Well done, hulk.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.536
Next time, iron man,
I would advise you

10:38.538 --> 10:41.172
To stay clear of
my eye-beams when...

10:41.174 --> 10:43.107
Stop, there is no next time.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.575
Why are you stopping me?

10:44.577 --> 10:46.711
I thought we were
on the same team.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.479
Avengers don't take lives.

10:49.481 --> 10:51.082
We save them.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.685
But this scum adds nothing
to the good of earth.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.420
He's a parasite!

10:55.422 --> 10:57.488
That may be true,
but we're not judge and jury.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.490
We have laws.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.093
If we don't follow them,
we're no better
than the criminals.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.062
Stand down, hyperion.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.664
Now.
I understand.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.167
Great. Cooler heads, right?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.102
Whew, for a second there,
I thought you'd gone...

11:11.104 --> 11:12.236
Uh-oh.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.439
It was the same
on my planet.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.641
If you're not part
of the solution,

11:16.643 --> 11:18.142
You're part of the problem!

11:21.380 --> 11:23.982
Says the guy blowing up
half of new york!

11:24.483 --> 11:25.650
Ahh!

11:27.653 --> 11:29.187
Not good!

11:44.136 --> 11:46.437
(grunts)

11:46.439 --> 11:48.172
Hawkeye, widow,
get the civilians
off this bridge now.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.640
Falcon, clear
out the wrecker.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.442
Going up!

11:51.444 --> 11:53.444
You're not helping
anyone, soldier.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.046
Believe me.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.049
Peace through force
is the only course that works.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.119
You're poisoning
these people's minds
with your soft ideals.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.520
Hulk: How's this for soft?
Huh?

12:02.522 --> 12:04.255
(roars)

12:17.669 --> 12:18.536
(yells)

12:27.246 --> 12:28.613
(groans)

12:28.615 --> 12:31.616
I am missing the battle!

12:31.618 --> 12:34.252
That should hold.
Go bring the thunder.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.386
At last.

12:36.722 --> 12:38.222
My hammer thirsts!

12:41.760 --> 12:43.528
Come, hyperion.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.264
Let me show you why they
call me the thunderer!

12:48.067 --> 12:49.233
(hyperion grunts)

12:51.837 --> 12:53.638
Hah!

12:53.640 --> 12:56.407
I really do
love your cape.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.309
I look forward
to wearing it
as a tribute

12:58.311 --> 12:59.577
When you're gone!

12:59.579 --> 13:00.645
(groans)

13:05.517 --> 13:07.852
<i>Right message,</i>
<i>wrong messenger.</i>

13:07.854 --> 13:09.754
<i>Hyperion is completely</i>
<i>out of his...</i>

13:11.190 --> 13:12.657
Do not run.

13:12.659 --> 13:16.194
I am here to bring
you law, order, peace!

13:16.196 --> 13:17.295
(kid grunts)

13:18.497 --> 13:19.831
What?

13:19.833 --> 13:21.732
You... You hurt the hulk!

13:24.870 --> 13:26.437
Why do you fight me?

13:28.574 --> 13:31.275
Must I save you
even from yourselves?

13:31.277 --> 13:32.710
(people shouting)

13:33.712 --> 13:35.246
(grunting)

13:38.784 --> 13:40.284
(boy screams)

13:43.655 --> 13:44.822
Thanks, hawkeye!

13:44.824 --> 13:45.857
What?
Let it go.

13:49.194 --> 13:51.229
Captain america:
You have a lot
to answer for, hyperion.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.264
Stand down, last chance.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.434
Last chance?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.803
That's what they said
on my planet, too.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.838
But I showed them.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.840
No, he couldn't have.

14:03.675 --> 14:05.209
Keep him busy.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.914
Tony? Tony,
where are you going?

14:11.817 --> 14:13.518
Finally, reason.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.753
Looks like iron man
has the most sense
out of all of you.

14:17.723 --> 14:18.856
Oh, yeah?

14:23.495 --> 14:25.196
Ah!

14:25.198 --> 14:27.932
Have to admit,
didn't expect that.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.567
I'm full of surprises.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.337
Okay, took out
his ears, eyes,

14:33.339 --> 14:34.872
Only thing left
is his super-strength.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.374
And all I gotta do
is stay ahead of him.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.308
And...

14:42.281 --> 14:43.881
You hurt me,
little one.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.650
Impressive.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.351
(falcon screaming)

14:47.353 --> 14:48.786
What was it? Oh yeah.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.254
Go limp!

14:52.591 --> 14:54.659
Now that's
what I call a save.

14:57.462 --> 14:59.197
(groans)

15:02.668 --> 15:05.203
(laughs)

15:05.205 --> 15:06.871
That should
chill him out.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.976
(grunts)

15:11.978 --> 15:13.744
This gonna leave a mark?

15:13.746 --> 15:16.614
Uh, I'd avoid
mirrors for a while.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.750
I'm gonna save
you whether you
like it or not.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.220
Captain america:
You save us? How about not.

15:27.926 --> 15:30.361
Your mind can't comprehend

15:30.363 --> 15:32.830
What comes next if you
continue on this path.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.299
Humans are flawed!

15:35.301 --> 15:37.335
You have no idea what
us humans are capable of.

15:42.307 --> 15:43.808
You look at our compassion,

15:43.810 --> 15:45.843
Our patience, our belief
in personal dignity,

15:45.845 --> 15:47.678
And see weakness.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.248
You have power,
but you let it blind you.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.483
You postpone the inevitable.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.551
Why?

15:55.387 --> 15:56.787
A distraction!

15:57.689 --> 15:58.990
My citadel.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.927
Tony, heads up.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.795
Whatever you're doing,
do it fast.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.931
Trouble's coming
your way, at
mach speed.

16:21.713 --> 16:23.681
Jarvis, tick-tock!

16:23.683 --> 16:25.750
Jarvis:  <i>Patience</i>
<i>is a virtue, sir.</i>

16:25.752 --> 16:26.851
(rumbling)

16:28.320 --> 16:29.654
Stark!

16:29.656 --> 16:31.822
Oh, hey, you still
want me to join
your team?

16:31.824 --> 16:33.624
No, iron man.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.060
I want you gone.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.975
Jarvis, I can probably last
about 3.2 seconds.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.643
Get a move on.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.478
Jarvis:  <i>Apologies, sir.</i>

16:54.480 --> 16:56.947
<i>His computers are almost</i>
<i>as powerful as he is.</i>

16:56.949 --> 17:00.351
<i>May I suggest playing pom</i>
<i>until I can access them?</i>

17:00.353 --> 17:02.687
Heh, you made that
sound almost doable.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.627
Hyperion, I got
a question for you.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.829
You know, before
you crush me and all.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.031
If earth is such
a crummy place,

17:14.032 --> 17:15.833
Why call it home?

17:15.835 --> 17:18.368
I chose earth
because it was weak

17:18.371 --> 17:19.804
And in need of saving.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.472
Chose earth?

17:21.473 --> 17:23.406
You're saying you
looked over your options

17:23.409 --> 17:24.974
And thought you
could put yourself

17:24.977 --> 17:26.844
On the top of the
food chain here?

17:26.846 --> 17:29.580
I offered you
peace and order!

17:38.423 --> 17:41.592
From the looks of it,
the avengers were gonna
be your rebound team.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.561
Unlike you, they
were willing to do

17:43.563 --> 17:45.696
Whatever was needed
to get the job done.

17:48.066 --> 17:53.437
Pathetic, to think
I believed you worthy
to be on my team.

17:54.139 --> 17:55.940
The stabilizers!

17:55.942 --> 17:57.575
Is that what
they were?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.377
I thought they
looked important.

17:59.878 --> 18:00.745
You!

18:06.485 --> 18:07.551
(yells)

18:10.856 --> 18:12.056
(grunting)

18:13.458 --> 18:16.727
Jarvis? I'm just about
all possumed out here!

18:18.397 --> 18:19.830
Give me something!
Anything!

18:21.800 --> 18:23.634
Jarvis:  <i>Uploading now.</i>

18:26.972 --> 18:27.838
(grunts)

18:30.876 --> 18:32.810
It's over, stark.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.880
I have defeated you
and your pathetic avengers.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.848
Like you did
to your own people?

18:37.850 --> 18:39.517
Jarvis, light it up.

18:40.685 --> 18:41.752
Huh?

18:43.755 --> 18:46.056
Iron man: No, you
enslaved them.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.858
Just like you want
to enslave us.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.661
No, this...

18:50.663 --> 18:51.996
It didn't. I...

18:54.933 --> 18:56.700
I offered them something!

18:56.702 --> 18:58.436
Something better.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.539
You drove them to fear
and desperation.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.007
They refused me!

19:05.911 --> 19:07.978
You made them hate you.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.814
They didn't
destroy themselves.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.115
<i>You destroyed</i>
<i>your own plat</i>

19:11.117 --> 19:13.551
<i>When they wouldn't</i>
<i>listen to you.</i>

19:14.453 --> 19:16.520
They didn't deserve me.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.857
They wouldn't listen.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.626
I tried to teach them
right from wrong.

19:22.628 --> 19:24.962
They chose wrong.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.498
I'll let you in
on something, hyperion.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.166
Humans aren't perfect.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.768
You're not perfect.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.703
You're not even a hero.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.505
You're a criminal.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.873
(screams)

19:39.978 --> 19:42.046
(laughs)

19:42.048 --> 19:44.248
What, another trick arrow?

19:44.250 --> 19:46.517
Does this one explode?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.752
No, distraction arrow.

19:53.925 --> 19:55.860
(thunder crashing)

19:59.798 --> 20:01.599
(thor yells)

20:05.837 --> 20:07.805
(groans)

20:07.807 --> 20:10.608
I believe this
belongs to me.

20:11.943 --> 20:13.844
Jameson:  <i>Hyperion revealed.</i>

20:13.846 --> 20:17.081
<i>News flash, new york!</i>
<i>We were hoodwinked.</i>

20:17.083 --> 20:20.284
<i>J. Jonah jameson</i>
<i>is not too big to be</i>
<i>the first to admit it.</i>

20:20.286 --> 20:22.920
<i>Hyperion was not a superhero.</i>

20:22.922 --> 20:26.023
Gotta admit it, hyperion
sucker-punched me too.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.159
Ow. For a second there,
I actually wanted him
to join us.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.930
I don't usually miss,
but when I do, man,
I miss big.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.632
We were all taken in.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.168
Power can be seductive.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.572
Just glad we found out
his true stripes
before it was too late.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.041
Where are they keeping
super-psycho, anyway?

20:44.043 --> 20:46.544
I'm itching for
a round two.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.045
You're gonna
have to wait.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.547
A long time.

20:54.252 --> 20:55.920
(grunts)

20:57.222 --> 20:59.056
<i>Release me!</i>

20:59.892 --> 21:04.895
<i>There will be</i>
<i>a coming threat.</i>
<i>There always is.</i>

21:04.897 --> 21:08.799
<i>And you will</i>
<i>find yourselves</i>
<i>in need of me!</i>

21:08.801 --> 21:11.335
<i>You'll see!</i>
<i>I am hyperion!</i>

21:11.337 --> 21:12.770
<i>I am the...</i>

21:15.140 --> 21:17.675
Ugh, I've heard enough.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.343
The day the world
needs that fool

21:19.345 --> 21:23.147
Is the day the avengers
are no longer here
to defend her.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.649
Especially, the son of asgard.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.052
You just winked at me.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.187
Why does...
Why does everyone
keep winking at me?

21:31.590 --> 21:32.823
Mmm, ha-ha!

21:32.825 --> 21:34.692
(grunts) another!
