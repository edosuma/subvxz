WEBVTT

00:04.088 --> 00:05.965
Told me Damian Cray is dangerous.

00:06.048 --> 00:10.428
The guy who killed him
was the same guy I saw in Cornwall.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.639
He works for an organization
that hires out to the highest bidder.

00:13.723 --> 00:16.475
- [Cray] Isn't this the guy who--
- [Evelyn] Is writing a book about you.

00:16.559 --> 00:17.852
[Cray] Says he's in a critical condition.

00:17.935 --> 00:18.978
But not dead.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.147
That's terrible.

00:21.814 --> 00:25.651
We're wondering about targets, right?
I think we need to look at Damian Cray.

00:26.235 --> 00:28.904
- Why?
- I think he's on SCORPIA's radar.

00:28.988 --> 00:31.073
Charlie Roper, right?
I'm a friend of Ed Pleasance.

00:31.157 --> 00:32.283
[Charlie] How do you know Ed?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.785
[Alex] I was with him in Cornwall
when they tried to kill him.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.203
- They?
- Damian Cray.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.539
[Charlie] I was at university with Ed.
He was my friend.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.041
He wanted to know about the game.
Damian's obsessed with it.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.753
What does it do that's worth killing for?

00:43.836 --> 00:44.670
Can you play?

00:44.754 --> 00:46.213
- Still looking for K7?
- [Evelyn] Yes.

00:46.297 --> 00:47.131
I've got him.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.343
Who is this kid?

00:55.181 --> 00:56.098
K7?

00:58.434 --> 01:00.269
- Hello, spy boy.
- Kyra.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.773
[Cray] Some kid just trashed
my pre-launch event.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.484
He's nothing to worry about.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.714
- [Sean] Welcome home, Mr. Cray.
- Thank you, Sean.

01:38.682 --> 01:39.600
Good night.

01:47.858 --> 01:48.984
[young Cray] Joe?

01:51.362 --> 01:52.571
Where are you?

01:55.658 --> 01:57.493
You said you'd read to me.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.125
["Bewitched theme" playing on TV]

02:21.392 --> 02:22.434

03:19.950 --> 03:22.328
[singer]

04:05.204 --> 04:07.081
- [Jack] So you're Kyra.
- [Kyra] Yeah.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.291
- From Point Blanc.
- And other places.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.585
- But how come you're here?
- How did you find me?

04:11.669 --> 04:13.379
Actually, you found me.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.547
Feathered Serpent leaderboard.

04:16.131 --> 04:19.468
When you registered as K7,
it got flagged on my profile.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.471
I saw it was you,
thought you might be in trouble.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.807
- Looks like I was right.
- You're in trouble?

04:25.641 --> 04:26.850
We got what we wanted.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.686
The new version of Feathered Serpent 2.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.980
The only advanced copy in the world.

04:31.063 --> 04:34.942
- Except that Cray tried to kill me.
- What? It's just a video game.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.237
He sent Yassen to blow up Sabina's dad
for writing a book about him.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.032
He had Smoking Mirror shot
for trying to tell the truth.

04:42.116 --> 04:45.035
- And then I get close and...
- Alex...

04:45.119 --> 04:46.328
I can't prove it.

04:46.412 --> 04:49.123
- Wait, who's Yassen?
- A paid killer.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.751
I saw him at Point Blanc.
And then in Cornwall, and now here.

04:53.419 --> 04:54.837
I think he's working for Cray.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.505
[Tom] Look, mate, you've got to face it,

04:56.588 --> 04:58.590
you're not gonna get
anywhere near Cray again.

04:58.674 --> 04:59.800
Maybe I don't have to.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.763
Cray's PR guy, Charlie Roper,
told me it's all about the game.

05:04.847 --> 05:05.889
Cray's obsessed with it.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.851
He's been driving the programmers crazy
trying to get it out in time.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.102
Whatever he's planning,

05:10.185 --> 05:13.355
it has to happen like clockwork,
down to the second.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.149
It's time-sensitive.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.317
And there's three days left.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.778
So you think
there's something hidden in the game?

05:20.529 --> 05:21.363
[Alex] Yes.

05:21.447 --> 05:22.781
Okay. Then we find it.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.539
- [Byrne] Assassination?
- We believe the president is the target.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.374
Because of the Pentagon hack?

05:32.458 --> 05:35.127
Those systems house
more than nuclear codes, ma'am.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.421
We think they wanted
the president's schedule.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.465
The Secret Service arrangements.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.384
Simon Marriat, the man who called
himself Smoking Mirror,

05:42.468 --> 05:45.763
had information regarding Damian Cray
on his personal computer.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.558
And Cray is hosting a charity dinner
in three days' time,

05:49.641 --> 05:52.644
at which President Walker
is the guest of honor.

05:52.728 --> 05:56.482
So Damian Cray, the president,
half a dozen billionaires,

05:56.565 --> 05:59.401
all focused on bringing down the cartels.

05:59.485 --> 06:02.446
- Same room, same time.
- I get it.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.615
It's a hell of a target.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.201
Obviously,
we think you should cancel the visit.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.869
[Byrne] If we canceled every event

06:08.952 --> 06:12.331
where the president's name came up,
she'd never leave the White House.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.249
I need more than conjecture.

06:17.961 --> 06:21.465
Yassen Gregorovitch
killed Smoking Mirror.

06:21.548 --> 06:25.511
We think he also tried to kill
a journalist who was close to Cray.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.889
I thought SCORPIA were finished.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.058
So did we.

06:32.518 --> 06:33.936
What else aren't you telling me?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.443
Let's try this.

06:47.825 --> 06:51.203
Smoking Mirror was killed in this
abandoned hangar in East London.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.959
Someone else was there.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.378
Now, maybe it's just me,

06:59.461 --> 07:03.590
but I think it's the kid who showed up
to Smoking Mirror's place.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.175
The one you didn't know.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.427
But he definitely knew you.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.976
- I think you're misreading the situation.
- [Byrne] Oh, really?

07:14.852 --> 07:16.019
Well, let's see.

07:16.645 --> 07:21.024
I think you have an illegal,
underage asset in the field,

07:21.108 --> 07:23.819
in the middle
of an increasingly volatile operation

07:23.902 --> 07:26.196
involving the president
of the United States.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.158
What exactly am I misreading?

07:29.241 --> 07:32.244
[tense music playing]

07:38.917 --> 07:42.087
Ah. Evelyn, good morning. Take a seat.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.798
Let me get you a coffee?

07:45.716 --> 07:48.093
- I don't drink coffee.
- Of course.

07:48.677 --> 07:54.600
The body needs 2.7 liters of water.
But it doesn't need flavoring. Right?

07:55.267 --> 07:56.351
- Right.
- Mm.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.107
I take it you wanna talk about last night.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.401
You were upset.

08:06.236 --> 08:10.365
Version 2 taken from our hands
days before the launch. Yeah.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.825
You could say that.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.454
The boy claimed to be K7.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.539
Obviously he wasn't.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.666
Someone set that up.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.962
Someone who knew about the event
and the security.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.131
He had help.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.467
From whom?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.053
Find out.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.681
[siren wailing]

08:39.394 --> 08:41.396
[EKG beeping]

08:45.651 --> 08:46.568
[sighs]

08:56.203 --> 08:59.748
Uncle Charlie! What are you doing here?

09:02.334 --> 09:03.710
I heard about your dad.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.172
I'm so sorry. How's he doing?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.550
Okay. Stable.

09:10.634 --> 09:14.137
They say he's,
you know, good, considering.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.430
I'm really sorry.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.557
It's not your fault.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.393
I didn't even know you were in London.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.813
I'm just in town for a few days. Work.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.772
Look.

09:24.356 --> 09:27.442
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

09:29.319 --> 09:33.156
I met this boy who said
that he was a friend of your dad's.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.450
Alex.

09:35.993 --> 09:36.952
Yeah.

09:37.703 --> 09:38.620
Alex.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.956
So you do know him?

09:41.957 --> 09:43.083
Look.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.584
You should know...

09:44.668 --> 09:45.752
Alex...

09:46.503 --> 09:48.922
he believes all this crazy stuff.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.176
Maybe it's not as crazy as you think.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.523
We need to talk to Alex.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.568
I thought you didn't want him
anywhere near us.

10:09.651 --> 10:10.819
That's exactly what I want.

10:10.902 --> 10:14.114
But he seems to have different ideas,
so he needs to be made aware.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.909
Well, you recruited him...

10:19.036 --> 10:20.162
you tell him.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.423
There is nothing here.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.967
- What do you mean?
- It's a game.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.802
It's great, but it's just a game.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.763
- [Alex] It can't be.
- [Kyra] I'm telling you it is.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.890
I'm not wrong.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.933
Whatever he's planning, it's in there.

10:42.017 --> 10:45.103
What's in there is tunnels,
monsters, Aztecs.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.314
It's all very immersive. But that is all.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.816
So let's check the game code.
Find out what's hiding--

10:49.900 --> 10:51.902
I've tried. It's locked.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.987
But you can unlock it.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.406
Can we talk?

10:57.741 --> 10:59.701
- We are talking.
- Somewhere else.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.125
[Kyra] You know, I'm ahead now. By one.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.252
[Alex] One what?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.381
[Kyra] You saved my life once.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.424
I saved yours twice.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.009
You're keeping score?

11:16.093 --> 11:18.595
Mm-hmm. And I'm ahead by one.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.555
I'll remember that.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.022
Someone killed my parents.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.985
It was made
to look like an accident, but...

11:35.695 --> 11:37.030
Kyra, I didn't know.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.325
I hated them a lot of the time.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.578
But, you know, they were my parents.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.330
I'm sorry.

11:45.914 --> 11:46.998
Yeah, same.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.756
So this man, Yassen...

11:57.551 --> 11:59.469
Is he coming after us?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.181
If Cray works out who we are...

12:04.224 --> 12:05.100
yeah.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.060
Okay.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.187
Then you need me.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.648
Because of the game.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.570
And I need you,
to find out who killed my parents.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.573
Do we have a deal?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.832
- You kept it.
- [Alex] Of course, I kept it.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.377
We don't need to have a deal
to help each other.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.630
We just help each other.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.343
Okay.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.519
[phone line ringing]

12:50.479 --> 12:51.938
We have a new factor.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.274
Something...

12:55.942 --> 12:57.569
unanticipated.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.657
Alex Rider is involved.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.077
He's made the connection to the game.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.834
- So how do we get to the game code?
- I can crack the anti-piracy encryption,

13:12.918 --> 13:15.670
but there is gigabytes of data on here.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.714
On a laptop, it'll take days.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.718
I need 20, maybe 30 machines
to network in parallel.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.596
So got any computers?

13:26.681 --> 13:29.768
School. Computer lab
got done up last term, it's all brand new.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.979
- I don't do school.
- That's actually not a bad idea.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.191
[Kyra] The only school
I've ever been to is Point Blanc.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.109
You remember
how that worked out, right?

13:39.778 --> 13:41.905
I don't like people.
I don't like institutions.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.115
And I'm not going to another school.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.450
What if it was empty?

13:45.534 --> 13:46.993
Why would it be empty?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.621
You're the hacker. You decide.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.382
Jack. Can I just borrow you a moment?

14:00.465 --> 14:01.299
Of course.

14:04.302 --> 14:08.098
There's a position coming up.
A permanent position.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.015
I see.

14:09.099 --> 14:13.228
I know you've been balancing some
domestic issues with your work life.

14:13.311 --> 14:16.314
If in due course
we were to offer you the position...

14:17.190 --> 14:18.775
- would you want to accept?
- Yes.

14:18.858 --> 14:23.029
No second thoughts, hesitations?
Of a personal nature, or any other?

14:23.113 --> 14:25.907
Not at all. This is what I wanna do.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.159
Good.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.996
That's all I needed to know.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.499
Obviously, we'll be considering Dan
for the position as well.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.126
There's only room for one.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.377
So...

14:37.460 --> 14:39.379
this is your time to impress us.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.260
- [Kyra] Ready?
- [Alex] Is this gonna work?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.637
Of course, it's going to work.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.852
[dramatic music playing]

14:58.565 --> 15:01.359
- You killed us, too.
- Killed the whole postcode.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.862
It's gonna look weird
if it's just one school, you know?

["Sleepwalking" playing]

15:05.363 --> 15:06.489

15:28.345 --> 15:29.179
Oh.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.015
[Tom grunts]

15:32.098 --> 15:33.058
Come on.

15:37.812 --> 15:38.813
Don't say a word.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.861
[singer]

15:49.157 --> 15:50.158
Off you go, then.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.702
[singer]

16:10.428 --> 16:12.889
Who wants to break
into a school anyway?

16:20.647 --> 16:24.859
[singer]

16:30.198 --> 16:31.825
[Tom] You know what?
How are the computers gonna work

16:31.908 --> 16:33.451
when there's no electricity?

16:33.535 --> 16:35.662
Mm. Magic pixies?

16:36.579 --> 16:38.707
I isolated the local substation.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.251
We can turn the school on and off
whenever we want.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.462
Don't worry, it's not like
I've never done this before.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.469
[Tom] Four!

16:52.554 --> 16:55.265
Four in Social Studies, Alex!
Can you believe that?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.516
Ain't surprising.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.268
Let's do this.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.647
[suspenseful music playing]

17:20.582 --> 17:21.791
[computers turning on]

17:46.608 --> 17:50.862
Okay. Like I said, anti-piracy encryption.
First we have to break this.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.656
When will everyone else
get their electricity back?

17:53.740 --> 17:54.657
When I say so.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.750
"All your bases are belong to us."

18:05.168 --> 18:08.087
We're past the encryption.
This is the game code.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.300
- So, what are we looking for?
- Anything unusual.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.345
I've networked all these computers
to run an automated scan program

18:15.428 --> 18:18.139
that will analyze the code, line by line.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.892
-It may take a while.
-[Alex] Hmm.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.901
So, what do you do for fun around here?

18:29.984 --> 18:31.694
There is no fun around here.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.322
Come on. I'll show you around.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.451
[door opens]

18:41.621 --> 18:42.664
[door closes]

18:46.209 --> 18:47.377
[Jack] Dan...

18:48.294 --> 18:51.047
did Matovu have
the conversation with you?

18:52.006 --> 18:54.050
A conversation about what?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.677
The one about the job.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.304
The position?

18:59.264 --> 19:01.307
And how there's only one of it.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.393
And two of us.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.688
And how I therefore need to impress.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.523
That would be the conversation, yeah.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.986
- How bad do you want this?
- More than you.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.029
Game on.

19:16.239 --> 19:17.740
That's a shame, you know?

19:18.366 --> 19:20.660
Well, I kind of prefer just being...

19:21.369 --> 19:23.746
you know, not rivals.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.126
Work's work.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.629
One of us is gonna get the job.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.007
It's not personal.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.134
Okay. Cool.

19:48.479 --> 19:51.357
Film Club. Japanese Club?

19:52.483 --> 19:54.360
Wildlife Club.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.279
- That's a lot of clubs.
- Hmm.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.867
Are you in these?

20:01.451 --> 20:02.410
No.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.414
Never really been a club kind of person.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.543
We could have our own club.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.295
Orphans Club.

20:16.507 --> 20:17.926
Hmm, Survivors Club.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.261
I'll make badges.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.023
What do you know about Yassen?

20:32.106 --> 20:35.485
[pensive music playing]

20:37.362 --> 20:38.196
Not much.

20:40.657 --> 20:41.950
But he knew me.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.578
In the hangar, he knew my name.

20:47.497 --> 20:50.249
And at Point Blanc, he recognized me.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.877
How is that possible?

20:54.212 --> 20:55.213
I don't know.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.050
But ever since I first saw him,

20:59.801 --> 21:01.719
I can't get him out of my head.

21:05.306 --> 21:08.142
I have a bad feeling inside...

21:09.936 --> 21:11.020
that it's him.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.486
We got company.

21:39.841 --> 21:42.218
- How did they find you?
- You have your phone?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.346
- Yeah.
- That's how they found him.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.389
It's fine.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.891
You guys will be okay
without me for a bit?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.352
Yeah, that'll be...

21:52.270 --> 21:53.146
fun.

21:56.941 --> 22:00.278
[ominous music playing]

22:01.863 --> 22:04.907
- What are you doing here?
- Blunt wants to see you.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.492
Yeah, and why is that?

22:06.576 --> 22:08.745
I'm sure he'll tell you himself.

22:33.227 --> 22:36.230
[ominous music playing]

22:56.876 --> 22:57.794
What's this?

22:58.336 --> 23:00.963
Belt, jacket, shoes, watch.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.925
Contents of your pockets
on the conveyor belt, please.

24:00.314 --> 24:01.190
This way.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.067
Hello, Alex.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.154
- You're not staying?
- No. I have a meeting.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.656
- [Alex] Yeah. Makes two of us.
- [Jones] Coffee sometime.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.702
Yeah. Sounds good.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.538
- Look after yourself.
- Nobody else does.

24:24.589 --> 24:25.965
Why don't you sit down?

24:36.934 --> 24:38.144
How are you, Alex?

24:38.728 --> 24:41.731
Why would you care?
I'm not an agent, remember?

24:41.814 --> 24:45.443
Because, despite everything,
I have a responsibility for you.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.905
Like you had
a responsibility for my uncle.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.532
What happened to your uncle
was unfortunate.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.493
I wouldn't want the same thing
to happen to you.

24:54.577 --> 24:55.870
Who killed him?

24:58.331 --> 25:00.124
Was it Yassen Gregorovitch?

25:03.586 --> 25:06.714
Tell me about Yassen.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.843
There's not much to tell.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.805
You said he worked
for an international organization.

25:14.889 --> 25:15.723
Which one?

25:16.307 --> 25:17.141
KGB?

25:19.352 --> 25:21.562
Microsoft? Amazon?

25:23.814 --> 25:25.608
They call themselves SCORPIA.

25:25.691 --> 25:29.904
We don't yet know exactly how
they're involved in the current operation,

25:29.987 --> 25:34.742
but what we do know is that
Gregorovitch is active in this country.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.203
As you told us.

25:37.286 --> 25:40.706
And for that, I owe you an apology.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.083
An apology?

25:43.584 --> 25:45.461
And what would you like in return?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.214
What I want
is for you to stay out of this.

25:48.839 --> 25:52.510
I want you to go back to school.
I want you to forget us.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.971
And let us look after Damian Cray.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.848
Look after him?

26:00.142 --> 26:01.352
Protect him.

26:01.936 --> 26:02.895
Protect him?

26:04.188 --> 26:07.817
Damian Cray was the one
who ordered the hit on Smoking Mirror.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.195
Damian Cray tried to kill Ed Pleasance.
It's the other way around.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.823
We need protection
against Damian Cray.

26:13.906 --> 26:18.953
Alex, SCORPIA are targeting
the president of the United States.

26:21.330 --> 26:26.002
Then they're doing that
because Damian Cray wants them to.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.295
It doesn't add up.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.631
Cray and the president are friends.

26:30.715 --> 26:32.883
His campaign contributions
got her elected.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.760
They're fighting
the war on drugs together.

26:34.844 --> 26:37.805
- Why would he wish her harm?
- I don't know exactly.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.348
But it's more than that.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.018
Something about his game.

26:46.147 --> 26:48.816
- Where's your evidence?
- I was working on it.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.777
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

26:52.778 --> 26:56.115
You've stumbled into a small corner
of a very much bigger picture.

26:56.198 --> 27:00.453
And while I appreciate
that you are trying to help us,

27:01.412 --> 27:03.831
in fact, you are putting lives at risk.

27:05.499 --> 27:06.500
That's not true.

27:08.419 --> 27:12.381
Five people shot dead
in the hackerspace.

27:13.424 --> 27:15.051
Smoking Mirror.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.429
I know, Gregorovitch killed him.
You flushed him into the open, though.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.349
I'm sorry, Alex,

27:21.932 --> 27:24.143
but there is blood on your hands.

27:25.394 --> 27:29.607
The only person who is putting
this operation at risk is you.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.860
You're wrong about Cray.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.745
I'll be watching you, Alex.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.540
Put a foot out of line, I will know.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.253
Don't make me your enemy.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.089
Too late.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.195
I've just had a call.

28:17.822 --> 28:21.325
The deputy director of the CIA
wants to meet.

28:21.909 --> 28:22.868
Why?

28:22.952 --> 28:25.913
They believe that I might be in danger.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.796
You might think that was funny
if you had a sense of humor.

28:33.879 --> 28:34.713
No.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.966
I don't think I would.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.011
What's the matter?

28:43.305 --> 28:45.766
You know you asked me
to keep an eye on that journalist?

28:45.850 --> 28:46.851
Ed Pleasance.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.228
- Don't tell me he's woken up.
- No.

28:50.521 --> 28:53.107
But I just found out
where he was getting his information.

28:53.732 --> 28:58.154
And I think it was the same person
who gave our fake K7 his security pass.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.242
[ominous music playing]

29:26.390 --> 29:28.350
So you went to
the weird school with Alex.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.268
Yeah.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.522
- Did they, like, make a clone of you too?
- Yeah.

29:37.985 --> 29:38.903
Two of you.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.280
It's weird.

29:41.363 --> 29:42.239
Yeah.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.576
Very weird.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.959
I've been his best mate since I was 5.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.838
St. Jude's Primary School.

29:57.922 --> 30:00.174
He was stood on his own in the corner,

30:00.257 --> 30:03.302
these two big lads ran over,
you know, real hard cases.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.304
And you went over and beat them up.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.266
No. He didn't need me, he just...

30:10.059 --> 30:12.102
He just stood up to them
like he always does.

30:12.186 --> 30:13.062
It was epic.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.525
I just went over afterwards
and had a laugh with him about it.

30:17.608 --> 30:18.526
That was it.

30:19.610 --> 30:20.653
Friends for life.

30:31.914 --> 30:32.957
So, uh...

30:33.791 --> 30:36.794
- You haven't met Sabina yet, have you?
- No.

30:37.378 --> 30:39.672
- Who's she?
- Alex really likes her.

30:40.381 --> 30:43.175
She's, uh, you know,
obviously very smart,

30:43.259 --> 30:44.885
and quite athletic.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.930
She's actually really nice, too.

30:48.973 --> 30:50.516
A good surfer, actually.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.481
This would be in Cornwall. On holiday.

30:58.607 --> 30:59.441
Yep.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.485
Her father is the journalist.

31:06.323 --> 31:07.992
- Okay. I get it.
- What?

31:08.701 --> 31:09.535
I get it.

31:10.369 --> 31:14.456
You're his friend. She's his girlfriend.
All the vacancies are filled.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.334
[cell phone beeps]

31:19.920 --> 31:20.879
What's that?

31:22.423 --> 31:23.549
Scan complete.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.050
Let's go.

31:35.436 --> 31:36.478
Attack?

31:37.313 --> 31:39.898
[Jones] The evidence we have
is not conclusive yet.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.985
But we have reason
to be concerned for your security.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.486
My security's excellent.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.905
Mr. Palmer is the best in the business.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.073
I'm sure he is.

31:49.366 --> 31:50.409
[Cray chuckles]

31:50.993 --> 31:53.537
You're not asking me
to cancel the dinner, are you?

31:54.288 --> 31:56.915
The president's only in London
for one day.

31:56.999 --> 31:58.834
This is my one chance
to shine a spotlight

31:58.917 --> 32:01.837
on what is arguably
the greatest humanitarian crisis

32:01.920 --> 32:03.047
in the world right now.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.049
- Narcotics.
- [Cray] Yes.

32:05.799 --> 32:06.800
And for the first time,

32:06.884 --> 32:09.928
I'm bringing together
the leader of the free world

32:10.012 --> 32:12.598
along with more money
and decision-making power

32:12.681 --> 32:14.308
than has ever been seen before.

32:14.391 --> 32:18.145
Which is exactly why your dinner
is such an attractive target.

32:18.228 --> 32:20.856
A target for who exactly, Ms. Byrne?

32:22.149 --> 32:24.485
Are we talking about the cartels?

32:24.568 --> 32:25.986
We're still looking into that.

32:28.906 --> 32:32.117
Mr. Cray, would you consider
delaying your event?

32:32.201 --> 32:35.496
Hosting your charity dinner
in, say, a month or two?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.627
My brother died in this house.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.547
I was 9 years old.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.300
[ominous music playing]

32:48.384 --> 32:50.386
I was looking for him.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.431
I had no idea
that he was experimenting with drugs.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.768
[screaming]

32:57.851 --> 32:59.687
He was 17 years old.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.315
And he was everything to me.

33:06.944 --> 33:10.114
This charity dinner is in his memory.

33:12.116 --> 33:15.911
And I am warning you,
I will not move it one hour,

33:15.994 --> 33:18.122
not one second.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.419
Do I make myself clear?

33:25.629 --> 33:28.215
[Kyra] Main data tree, subroutines...

33:30.008 --> 33:31.552
Why is this all nested?

33:32.678 --> 33:34.930
- This is not good.
- What's not good?

33:35.764 --> 33:40.728
- Please tell me you've got something.
- I can't access the core programming.

33:40.811 --> 33:42.271
Big chunks of code are--

33:43.063 --> 33:46.316
It's like it's been locked away.
It's redacted.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.111
- What kind of code?
- I don't know because I can't get to it.

33:49.570 --> 33:51.363
But what is there is weird.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.575
I think you were right.
I think the game's not a game.

33:54.658 --> 33:57.244
I think it's supposed to do
something totally different.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.664
Something network based.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.584
- But it's there?
- Yeah. Problem is getting to it.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.753
Simply not enough processing power.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.046
Looks like we're gonna need
a bigger computer.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.715
No. You don't understand.

34:09.798 --> 34:11.717
We're way beyond
hashed and salted here.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.428
Even with the biggest computer
on the planet,

34:14.511 --> 34:16.221
brute-forcing this would take too long.

34:16.305 --> 34:18.098
- How long?
- Maybe...

34:18.724 --> 34:22.311
six trillion times
the lifetime of the universe.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.353
Sorry.

34:23.437 --> 34:26.815
The only way to unlock this
is to go back to the original server,

34:26.899 --> 34:28.609
and that's at CrayStar in Amsterdam.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.652
- We can't.
- [Tom] Why not?

34:30.736 --> 34:32.613
Looks like school's
gonna be out for a while.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.032
It's not that. I saw Blunt.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.785
He doesn't want me to get involved.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.789
- He made himself very clear.
- [Kyra] Why?

34:41.872 --> 34:42.956
[Alex] I don't know.

34:44.041 --> 34:49.004
- But he's watching me.
- [Tom] So you're just gonna give up?

34:49.087 --> 34:53.091
[Alex] Don't have a choice.
They didn't believe a word I said.

34:53.175 --> 34:54.218
- They think...
- Good.

34:54.301 --> 34:55.385
...Cray's the victim.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.596
- Keep an eye on him.
- [Alex] They're working with him.

34:57.679 --> 35:00.224
- [Tom] So, what? That's it?
- Seems he got the message.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.558
Let me know if anything else comes out.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.268
[Alex] Maybe Blunt's right.

35:03.352 --> 35:06.605
[Smithers] Alex thinks we should be
looking at Cray as an operator.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.148
Not a target.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.567
[Alex]
If we got some proof from the game...

35:10.651 --> 35:11.819
Yes?

35:11.902 --> 35:15.447
You don't think he might be right?
He has been right in the past.

35:15.531 --> 35:18.450
[Alex] I don't know. I'm done with this.

35:18.534 --> 35:19.493
[marker squeaking over computer]

35:19.576 --> 35:21.662
Maybe I'm wrong about Cray.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.831
I'm going home.

35:23.914 --> 35:26.542
I'll see you guys
when school starts up again, okay?

35:39.179 --> 35:41.181
[Cray] Is the plane on standby, Charlie?

35:41.265 --> 35:42.641
It's two days until the launch.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.852
I wanna oversee
the final stages in person.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.020
[Charlie] Yep, I've cleared your schedule
for tomorrow

35:47.104 --> 35:49.439
and the programming team
is expecting you in Amsterdam.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.400
I want you to come with me.

35:52.359 --> 35:53.360
But I have the press.

35:54.319 --> 35:57.197
And these new security arrangements,
the embassy to liaise with--

35:57.281 --> 36:00.367
Sean will oversee the security.
That's his job.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.620
You're coming with us.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.622
I thought you wanted me here.

36:05.706 --> 36:08.584
Right now, I want you by my side.

36:11.295 --> 36:13.547
I wanna keep you close, Charlie.

36:13.630 --> 36:16.049
[ominous music playing]

36:27.394 --> 36:30.439
Here. Alex said he'd given up.

36:30.522 --> 36:34.318
He said he had no chance
and that was the end of it.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.488
- That doesn't sound like Alex.
- Exactly.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.409
While he was speaking,
I heard something.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.580
It sounded like a sort of squeaking.

36:46.663 --> 36:47.873
Squeaking?

36:51.376 --> 36:56.340
- [Alex] I don't know. But he's watching.
- [Tom] So you're just gonna give up?

36:56.423 --> 36:57.966
- Don't have a choice.
- [marker squeaking]

36:58.050 --> 37:01.136
They didn't believe a word I said.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.222
They think Cray's the victim.
They're working with him.

37:04.306 --> 37:05.307
THEY'RE LISTENING.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.226
LISTENING.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.941
Now, that's Alex.

37:14.816 --> 37:17.194
So, what? That's it?

37:17.277 --> 37:18.695
Maybe Blunt's right.

37:18.779 --> 37:21.490
It's none of my business anyway.
None of it.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.743
If we got some proof from the game,

37:25.327 --> 37:27.746
that might have made a difference, but...

37:27.829 --> 37:29.915
I don't know. I'm done with this.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.042
Maybe I'm wrong about Cray.

37:33.543 --> 37:34.544
I'm going home.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.172
I'll see you guys
when school starts up again, okay?

37:39.925 --> 37:41.218
Sure.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.390
Who's Juliet?

["Disinfect" playing]

37:56.984 --> 37:59.611
[singer]

39:00.422 --> 39:05.052
[yelling] Alex, I got your message.
Can you turn that down?

39:13.101 --> 39:15.312
I'm going away for a couple of days.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.731
Kyra's gonna keep
the power off at school.

39:17.814 --> 39:20.692
Keep it shut down,
so that no one will miss me.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.027
Away where?

39:22.611 --> 39:24.071
I don't wanna tell you.

39:24.654 --> 39:27.699
If I tell you,
I have to make you part of it.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.870
I didn't wanna just disappear.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.414
This is Damian Cray, isn't it?

39:35.165 --> 39:37.209
The department still don't believe me.

39:37.918 --> 39:41.463
But Ed, Yassen, Smoking Mirror, Cray...

39:42.214 --> 39:43.590
It's all connected.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.221
No matter what Blunt says,
I can't just sit back and let it happen.

39:55.811 --> 39:56.937
Be safe.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.707

- Where's he going?

40:17.791 --> 40:19.251
Heading east.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.678
He's stopped on Euston Road.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.037
- Sir...
- [Blunt] What's happening?

40:56.746 --> 40:58.165
I don't understand.
