WEBVTT

00:04.792 --> 00:06.083
What is taking Jerry so long?

00:06.166 --> 00:07.542
We're going to miss the movie.

00:07.875 --> 00:08.959
We're going to see a movie?

00:09.041 --> 00:10.583
You guys told me
we were going to get pizza.

00:10.917 --> 00:13.792
That's because if we told you
we were going to see, "Secret Agent Moose"

00:13.875 --> 00:15.083
you wouldn't have wanted to go.

00:15.458 --> 00:17.041
That's because it's about a secret.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.250
Agent... Moose!

00:21.875 --> 00:24.375
Pa, pa, pa. Poow!

00:24.750 --> 00:25.875
Where have you been?

00:26.542 --> 00:27.709
Check out my necklace,

00:27.792 --> 00:29.709
yeah, I got it from one
of those crane machines.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.583
That's a moon rock, bro.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.041
From the moon.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.834
You believe that rock's from the moon?

00:36.917 --> 00:39.542
What you think they fill those
arcade crane machines with junk?

00:42.083 --> 00:46.375
Oh, great, now I'm boxed in
by a car full of bald dudes.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.250
Jerry, tell me how much room I have.

00:51.166 --> 00:53.291
Ah, come on back Rudy,
you've got plenty of room.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.166
Little more...

00:56.709 --> 00:57.709
Little more...

00:58.291 --> 01:00.917
- A little--
-

01:01.000 --> 01:01.875
That's good.

01:02.709 --> 01:04.458
Okay, that was not my fault.

01:06.417 --> 01:07.834
Oh, great, now they're getting out.

01:09.333 --> 01:11.333
They look like Shaolin Warriors.

01:11.959 --> 01:14.750
- Where'd they go?
- What are Shaolin Warriors?

01:15.208 --> 01:18.458
- Yaah!

01:18.542 --> 01:20.041
Those are Shaolin Warriors.

01:22.792 --> 01:26.041
<i>♪ Don't you get all tough with me ♪</i>

01:26.125 --> 01:29.834

<i>♪ It's not as cool

02:06.083 --> 02:08.959
This picture on your driver's license
does not look like you.

02:09.333 --> 02:12.041
Well I just wanted to look good
for the picture,

02:12.125 --> 02:14.500
so I got a few highlights in my hair.

02:14.834 --> 02:18.959
Oh...

02:19.375 --> 02:21.917
Highlights.

02:23.875 --> 02:26.959
I hope we did not startle you
when we jumped on your car.

02:27.041 --> 02:30.000
Oh, no we get it,
as a Shaolin Warrior you're conditioned

02:30.083 --> 02:31.917
to react to the vibrations
in your environment.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.458
That and we thought mister highlights
was going to pull a smash and dash.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.500
You guys are the greatest martial artists
that ever lived.

02:40.583 --> 02:43.500
Your discipline, dedication,
and focus, are legendary.

02:43.583 --> 02:46.333
I must say you have a very beautiful dojo.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.375
Would you like us
to give you a quick demonstration?

02:48.500 --> 02:50.333
Oh, we'd be honored.

02:50.375 --> 02:51.375
Yeah.

02:53.542 --> 02:54.417
Bow.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.375
Ha!

02:59.458 --> 03:00.291
Ha!

03:10.125 --> 03:11.333
Wasabi!

03:12.583 --> 03:14.125
Very impressive!

03:14.500 --> 03:16.000
If you would like maybe sometime

03:16.083 --> 03:18.000
you could come to our temple
and train with us.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.375
Perhaps this weekend?

03:19.458 --> 03:21.375
- We'd love to.
- That would be awesome.

03:21.458 --> 03:22.542
Now, hold on.

03:23.041 --> 03:25.834
I've got a lot on my plate,
let me check the old sched.

03:27.792 --> 03:31.458
Mm, got a date with Carol Friday night,
I can move that to Wednesday.

03:31.542 --> 03:34.959
And then bounce Donna to Thursday.

03:35.041 --> 03:38.125
The twins, the twins,
what am I gonna do with the twins?

03:39.792 --> 03:41.834
- Rudy, that's a pizza menu.
- Okay, I'm in.

03:58.625 --> 04:01.417
This is officially the coolest place
I've ever been.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.041
We get that a lot.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.542
We knew this was our home
when we broke ground with a pickaxe,

04:14.625 --> 04:17.458
and sparked the eternal flame
that's burned ever since.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.917
- What happens if it rains?
- Still burns.

04:22.375 --> 04:25.583
- Well, what about strong winds?
- Still burns.

04:25.709 --> 04:29.083
- How about if it were to be--
- What are not getting about still burns?

04:32.166 --> 04:36.208
Yo, I'm feeling a little gassy,
I wonder what would happen if I--

04:36.291 --> 04:38.375
Don't even think about it Jerry.

04:38.917 --> 04:41.750
Oh, right, yeah I'll save up
for a really big one.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.208
Our Grand Master meditates here alone
every night.

04:47.333 --> 04:51.000
When the light of the moon,
dances upon the peacocks tear.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.041
Around 9-ish.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.792
That is Zang Lu.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.709
Guardian of the temple,

05:03.792 --> 05:07.583
and next in line behind the Grand Master
to control its destiny.

05:08.083 --> 05:11.750
By willing his mind a Shaolin Warrior,

05:11.834 --> 05:15.250
can make his body withstand any force
that comes against it.

05:19.625 --> 05:23.166
- Dude, that was incredible.
- You should consider yourselves lucky,

05:23.834 --> 05:27.041
very rarely do we allow outsiders
within our sacred walls.

05:27.625 --> 05:31.000
Well, we're not really outsiders
home-slice.

05:32.458 --> 05:36.083
In fact you're looking at a couple
of black belts right here.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.000
So if you think about it we're all part
of the same martial arts fam...

05:40.917 --> 05:42.417
Wow, that's a thick piece of wood.

05:46.375 --> 05:50.625
Zang Lu, you are to train these students
in the Shaolin way.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.875
Unfortunately I do not have the time,
nor--

05:52.959 --> 05:56.125
It is a request from the Grand Master.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.291
Very well.

05:58.834 --> 05:59.959
Follow me.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.917
We call this, the path of fire.

06:04.500 --> 06:09.000
These tiles are heated by the same
natural gas that fuels the eternal flame.

06:13.458 --> 06:15.417
The path of fire challenges us...

06:15.458 --> 06:18.917
to block out pain,
and increase our discipline.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.542
And one time we used it
to make a really big pancake.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.875
I got this.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.667
I've got just as much discipline
as anyone else.

06:44.208 --> 06:48.041
I mean not to mention the fact
that women can handle ten times more--

06:48.125 --> 06:50.959
Ah! Sweet cheese that is hot!

06:53.166 --> 06:55.166
Let me show you how a man does it Kim.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.125
See?

07:02.959 --> 07:03.875
Mind over matter.

07:04.709 --> 07:07.542
- I'm feeling absolutely no pain--
- Dude your feet are on fire.

07:07.625 --> 07:08.875
- My feet are on what now?
- Fire!

07:11.083 --> 07:13.500
Fire! My feet are on fire!

07:13.583 --> 07:15.834
Oh, oh, oh.

07:16.750 --> 07:19.291
So, uh, that's how a man does it Jack?

07:20.125 --> 07:22.917
Not funny Kim,
I just barbecued my piggy's.

07:29.792 --> 07:31.500
Why are you eating that cabbage?

07:32.500 --> 07:34.083
Gassing up my tank bro.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.458
I want to be ready for my alone time
with that eternal flame.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.917
This is the silent meditation room.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.542
I heard some of these guys
haven't spoken in 20 years.

07:44.291 --> 07:46.166
Dude, you couldn't shut up
for 20 seconds.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.792
Oh, yeah, watch this.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.208
Oh, here we go.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.875
You ever get that thing
where you close your eyes,

08:04.959 --> 08:06.208
and you see the lights, and shapes,

08:06.291 --> 08:08.208
moving around on the inside
of your eyelids?

08:13.250 --> 08:14.959
Because I'm getting that right now.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.625
It happens because your optic nerves
are spazzing

08:21.709 --> 08:23.333
from the deprivation of stimuli.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.375
That's what some people say.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.166
The Egyptians believed that there
was a Demon living inside your...

08:31.250 --> 08:32.667
- Enough!
- Sorry.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.959
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, oh, oh!

08:37.625 --> 08:40.834
- Dude, you are so busted.
- No, I am not!

08:40.917 --> 08:42.208
- Oh!
- Did it again.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.542
- We've got a talker.
- Right here.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.458
- Take him.
- He would not shut up!

08:46.667 --> 08:47.792
He would not shut up!

08:59.875 --> 09:02.458
And now, in honor of your visit,

09:02.542 --> 09:06.792
we have prepared a special demonstration
of our Shaolin skills.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.041
Jerry, can you believe how strong...

09:18.166 --> 09:20.750
Jerry? Hey, where's Jerry?

09:20.834 --> 09:23.875
He said he was "ready to blow", then left.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.333
The flame! Jerry!

09:26.625 --> 09:27.834
No!

09:28.458 --> 09:29.291
- No!

09:29.375 --> 09:31.291
-
- Woo!

09:31.375 --> 09:32.792
- Oh!
-

09:37.458 --> 09:41.458
You! We open our home to you
and your friends and you dishonor us?

09:47.917 --> 09:51.500
Yo, I'm not even a little bit sorry,
that was awesome!

09:52.375 --> 09:55.041
You and your friends must leave.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.834
My apologies for disturbing
you Grand Master Po.

10:03.917 --> 10:07.083
A great power has entered the temple.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.500
Right back at you Po.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.875
He is here to fulfill...

10:14.417 --> 10:15.542
the prophecy.

10:15.625 --> 10:16.834
What prophecy?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.667
It has been foretold,

10:18.750 --> 10:21.500
that a dark cloud
would threaten our temple.

10:21.792 --> 10:25.458
But, that a great warrior
would arrive to save it.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.166
That warrior is here.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.083
You!

10:35.000 --> 10:35.959
Me?

10:36.375 --> 10:38.208
Yes, you!

10:39.291 --> 10:42.000
- What is your friends' name?
- Ah, that's Jerry.

10:44.041 --> 10:45.125
Jerry!

10:46.041 --> 10:48.875
- You are The Chosen One.
-

10:48.959 --> 10:51.417
Nah. No, no.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.959
Uh, I think Grand Master
eyebrows needs a nap.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.750
Surely you are mistaken Grand Master.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.542
This boy cannot be him.

11:02.625 --> 11:05.250
There is a way to be certain,
Grand Master.

11:05.917 --> 11:10.875
We must see if he possess
the three diamond mark of The Chosen One.

11:13.291 --> 11:14.125
Diamond.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.083
Diamond.

11:16.291 --> 11:17.375
Diamond!

11:17.458 --> 11:18.583
Jackpot!

11:19.166 --> 11:20.542
We have a winner!

11:31.333 --> 11:33.709
You guys believe Jerry's The Chosen One?

11:33.792 --> 11:36.083
Please, Jerry's not The Chosen One.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.750
Even he's not dumb enough to believe that.

11:41.041 --> 11:43.083
Chosen One in the house, yo!

11:47.083 --> 11:49.291
Okay, you know this is ridiculous.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.083
I have to tell them
Jerry's not The Chosen One.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.750
- Can I say something?
- Of course.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.041
You found him, which means...

12:00.291 --> 12:02.125
you are the enlightened one.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.500
Jerry is The Chosen One
and you heard the Grand Poobah,

12:06.583 --> 12:08.375
I am not too shabby myself.

12:11.792 --> 12:16.667
Here are fine silk robes
for the friends of The Chosen One.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.000
- Oh, sweet.
- Wow.

12:19.291 --> 12:22.458
You know, maybe we can stay
a little bit longer.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.750
Um, I'm gonna need this in a petite, hun.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.291
Oh.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.917
Gather around everyone,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
it is time for me to teach you
the way of the swag.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.083
Oh...

12:35.458 --> 12:39.083
I'm sorry, what is "the way of the swag"?

12:39.166 --> 12:40.542
Check it Chi.

13:16.542 --> 13:19.917
Tomorrow at 9:00,
we will extinguish two flames.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.834
Yo, Zang Lu, what's up with the flame?

13:26.417 --> 13:28.125
Nothing to concern yourself with.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.125
Okay.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.917
Well, I'm off to my meeting
with the Grand Master.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.875
Yeah, today we're going to share
secret mystical powers with each other.

13:35.959 --> 13:38.250
He's going to teach me to use meditation
to travel through time.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.959
And what could you possibly teach him?

13:41.375 --> 13:43.750
How to freak people out
by flipping your eyelids inside out.

13:47.083 --> 13:47.917
See ya.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.792
Take it easy you, I am enlightened.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.333
Everyone!

14:19.041 --> 14:21.083
Everyone, I have summoned
you to tell you...

14:21.333 --> 14:22.875
Jerry is a liar.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.000
- He is not The Chosen One.
- Uh, hello.

14:32.709 --> 14:33.875
All,

14:33.959 --> 14:35.750
It was never a birthmark,

14:35.834 --> 14:38.291
it was a mark caused
by his cheap necklace.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.375
You have deceived us.

14:48.417 --> 14:50.125
You and your friends...

14:50.875 --> 14:53.875
are banished from this temple, forever!

14:55.625 --> 14:57.959
You heard him, get out!

15:00.917 --> 15:02.792
Can you believe these kids?

15:03.667 --> 15:06.333
Hey, Po, what do you say we grab
a quick spritz before dinner.

15:07.542 --> 15:10.000
What? Me too, really?

15:16.709 --> 15:18.834
I have never been so embarrassed.

15:19.250 --> 15:23.834
A whole temple of Shaolin Warriors
is unfairly questioning my integrity.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.375
Did you guys see
these sweet towels I took?

15:29.834 --> 15:32.000
What? They expect you to take them.

15:33.583 --> 15:36.166
I'm telling you that guy Zang Lu
had it out for me.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.458
Well maybe it's because
you misled everybody

15:38.542 --> 15:41.041
and made them think you were
the grand high mystic exalted one.

15:41.125 --> 15:44.792
Hey, I only believed it because
that Chinese Santa Claus said I was.

15:45.417 --> 15:49.250
He was all like,
"Oh, you are The Chosen One".

15:52.583 --> 15:55.500
I don't think Zang Lu liked that the fact
I saw him turn off the eternal flame.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.792
What are you talking about?

15:57.875 --> 16:00.709
That flame has been burning
for over a hundred years.

16:01.375 --> 16:02.959
Well, he and some other dude shut it off.

16:03.500 --> 16:07.166
Then I heard Zang Lu say something
about extinguishing two flames at 9:00.

16:08.041 --> 16:12.000
Wait, isn't 9:00 when the Grand Master
meditates alone?

16:13.250 --> 16:14.166
It is.

16:14.542 --> 16:17.458
Yo, what about the prophecy about
a dark cloud threatening the temple?

16:17.917 --> 16:18.959
What are you saying?

16:19.041 --> 16:21.375
I'm saying what if Zang Lu
is the dark cloud?

16:22.291 --> 16:25.542
- Yo, we gotta go back!
- Jerry! Let it go,

16:25.625 --> 16:28.041
okay, you're not The Chosen One
and we're not going back.

16:28.417 --> 16:29.291
We were banished.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.542
I don't have to be The Chosen One
to have a gut feeling something's wrong.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.125
And if you guys
don't want to come with me...

16:35.792 --> 16:36.875
I'll go by myself.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.458
So you're going back to a place
you're not welcome,

16:39.542 --> 16:43.166
to face a hundred of the fiercest
martial arts Warriors in the world!

16:43.250 --> 16:44.291
By yourself?

16:46.500 --> 16:47.417
Yes.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.041
Yes, I am.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.875
I cannot believe
we shaved our heads for this.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.542
I cannot believe your head
is shaped like a lemon.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.083
Jack, you okay?

17:20.667 --> 17:21.917
I don't know how to say this but...

17:23.041 --> 17:24.542
my hair was my best friend.

17:26.709 --> 17:29.959
Listen, we just have to blend in
and get past those guys.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.625
Okay, then we can split up
and warn Grand Master Po.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.834
Excuse me, where are you coming from?

17:40.417 --> 17:41.417
Um...

17:42.709 --> 17:46.125
Where the soul of the sacred tiger...

17:46.583 --> 17:49.583
meets the spirit of the half-moon.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.959
I do not know what that means.

17:56.917 --> 17:58.083
We went to the movies.

17:58.709 --> 17:59.542
Oh.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.542
- Oh, Grand Master!
- Jerry?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.041
Why are you here?

18:10.542 --> 18:12.834
- You have been banished.
- No, look,

18:12.917 --> 18:15.208
Zang Lu's planning something,
I think you are in danger.

18:15.291 --> 18:19.750
Impossible.
He has vowed to protect me and the temple.

18:19.959 --> 18:23.000
Sadly, a vow I must break.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.917
What is the meaning of this?

18:26.333 --> 18:29.792
This temple sits on a mountain
of natural gas, worth millions.

18:30.250 --> 18:34.959
Once you are gone, I will be in control.
And will sell it to collect a fortune.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.250
But you are a Shaolin Warrior!

18:37.583 --> 18:39.625
The ways of the Shaolin are over.

18:40.041 --> 18:42.333
And soon, you will be too.

18:42.417 --> 18:45.875
Oh, real brave.
Take out the old man with the staff.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.375
You're right.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.375
-
- I don't need it.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.792
That's it, I may not be The Chosen One,

18:55.875 --> 18:57.750
but I have chosen to be the one that--

18:57.834 --> 18:59.500
Oh! O-oh!

18:59.583 --> 19:01.000
Not cool man I wasn't finished.

19:06.458 --> 19:07.709
Ah!

19:13.417 --> 19:14.834
Give me your hand.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.291
Jerry, how did you do that?

20:06.375 --> 20:09.542
You just defeated the fiercest warrior
in the entire temple.

20:13.458 --> 20:16.625
- He gave me--
- I gave you, what you gave me.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.125
Friendship.

20:18.875 --> 20:20.041
You came back.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.291
Risking your life to save mine.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.000
I didn't come back alone.

20:30.458 --> 20:34.375
Now I understand why I felt such power.

20:35.542 --> 20:38.834
When the Wasabi Warriors are together...

20:40.542 --> 20:42.542
there is no greater power.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.291
He's right guys.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.250
Bring it in!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.417
You too Grand Master.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.375
Wasabi!

20:59.250 --> 21:00.750
Well, Grand Master Po,

21:00.834 --> 21:02.750
maybe we'll come back
and visit you sometime.

21:03.750 --> 21:07.291
You and your friends
are always welcome here, Jerry.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.625
- Oh, whoa, whoa!
- Jerry, what are you doing?

21:17.125 --> 21:20.333
You just walked over tiles
that were 600 degrees, without flinching.

21:21.291 --> 21:22.875
Maybe I am The Chosen One.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.834
Ah!

21:29.041 --> 21:29.917
Nope.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.041
