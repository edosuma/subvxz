WEBVTT

00:01.698 --> 00:02.399
Hey, guys.

00:02.399 --> 00:03.833
Can I borrow
your sarcophagus?

00:03.833 --> 00:05.001
Oh, sure.

00:05.001 --> 00:06.936
It's in the garage
right next to Salem's bike

00:06.936 --> 00:08.405
which he begged for
and never used.

00:08.405 --> 00:12.976
I told you
the seat pinches my cathood.

00:13.508 --> 00:14.776
Miles is directing
a horror movie

00:14.776 --> 00:16.678
and I agreed to produce it.

00:16.678 --> 00:18.546
Oh, my, you're making
a picture?

00:18.546 --> 00:19.681
A movie.

00:19.681 --> 00:21.649
Well, that's so exciting.

00:21.649 --> 00:24.185
Surely the sarcophagus
isn't the only thing

00:24.185 --> 00:25.820
you need from your aunties.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.122
You're right.
Do have any
lunch meat?

00:28.122 --> 00:28.656
Because we're
holding

00:28.656 --> 00:29.691
auditions tomorrow

00:29.691 --> 00:31.092
and I want to put out
some snacks.

00:31.092 --> 00:32.927
Let's go back to
that word "audition."

00:32.927 --> 00:34.462
Normally I won't
read for a part

00:34.462 --> 00:36.464
but since Miles has
never seen my work...

00:36.464 --> 00:38.700
He can die a happy man.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.301
Go ride your
bike in traffic.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.069
Eh?

00:41.069 --> 00:42.136
As much as I'd love

00:42.136 --> 00:43.705
to have your enormous talents
in my movie...

00:43.705 --> 00:46.741
this is just a cheesy student
film that is way beneath you.

00:46.741 --> 00:47.742
Nicely done.

00:49.809 --> 00:51.477
Sabrina, to a true thespian

00:51.477 --> 00:52.779
no part is too small.

00:52.779 --> 00:54.647
Or too cheesy.

00:54.647 --> 00:57.116
Oh, no, we can't do the movie.

00:57.116 --> 00:58.418
Dang it!

00:58.418 --> 01:00.686
We've been selected
for Other Realm scare duty.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.021
Scare duty?

01:02.021 --> 01:03.156
That can't be.

01:03.156 --> 01:05.124
We just did scare duty
200 years ago.

01:05.124 --> 01:06.225
Scare duty?

01:06.225 --> 01:07.827
Witch equivalent
of jury duty.

01:07.827 --> 01:10.763
The Other Realm randomly selects
experienced witches

01:10.763 --> 01:13.699
to teach the younger generation
how to scare people.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.835
Apparently,
they didn't buy our excuse

01:15.835 --> 01:17.570
that we were fighting
overseas.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.305
Hey, you may not be starring
in a horror movie

01:19.305 --> 01:20.706
but at least
you get to scare people.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.375
Want to really
scare people?

01:22.375 --> 01:24.544
Leave the house
without your makeup.

01:25.578 --> 01:26.579
Ooh!

01:26.579 --> 01:28.781
Ooh, that pinches!

01:28.781 --> 01:30.482
Pinches... no!

01:30.482 --> 01:31.548
( <i>crashing</i> )

01:31.548 --> 01:34.684
Oh! I think he dented
his cathood on that Chrysler.

01:38.621 --> 01:44.794
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:45.228 --> 01:51.000
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:51.234 --> 01:54.404
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:54.404 --> 01:58.575

02:20.762 --> 02:21.929
Oh, no.
Don't tell me

02:21.929 --> 02:24.232
you're already obsessing
over Halloween.

02:24.232 --> 02:25.366
It's just a
lame holiday

02:25.366 --> 02:26.434
like Secretary's Day.

02:26.434 --> 02:27.468
What's the point?

02:27.468 --> 02:29.137
They have to order
their own flowers.

02:29.137 --> 02:31.539
This had nothing to do
with Halloween.

02:31.539 --> 02:32.907
I'm making a picture.

02:32.907 --> 02:33.741
I mean, a movie.

02:33.771 --> 02:34.505
It's going to be
a ground-breaking

02:34.505 --> 02:37.541
cinematic exploration
of pure evil.

02:37.541 --> 02:39.843
With an upbeat musical number
at the end.

02:39.843 --> 02:41.679
You can put the lights
behind the sofa

02:41.679 --> 02:44.548
and the camera
goes in my room.

02:44.548 --> 02:45.482
So, what did you
think of the changes

02:45.482 --> 02:46.483
I made to my script?

02:46.483 --> 02:47.451
Brilliant.

02:47.451 --> 02:48.619
Adding the extra cheerleader

02:48.619 --> 02:49.720
really gives it
emotional reticence.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.222
Thanks. I thought we could

02:51.222 --> 02:53.190
shoot the new stabbing scene
in your bedroom.

02:53.190 --> 02:54.191
As in <i>my</i> bedroom?

02:54.191 --> 02:55.526
Forget about it.

02:55.526 --> 02:57.294
There's no way I'm letting
a bunch of bad student actors

02:57.294 --> 02:58.395
invade my personal space.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.964
I'm just the writer-
slash-director.

02:59.964 --> 03:01.765
You'll have to
take it up with
my producer.

03:01.765 --> 03:06.303
Oh, look, I can assure you that
no damage will be done to...

03:06.303 --> 03:07.471
Wait a minute.

03:07.471 --> 03:09.373
I know what this is about.

03:09.373 --> 03:12.576
How would you like
to play a cheerleader?

03:12.576 --> 03:13.577
Are you kidding?

03:13.577 --> 03:14.712
Who in their right mind

03:14.712 --> 03:17.114
would want to be in the
<i>Blood of Mindy Adelman?</i>

03:17.114 --> 03:18.849
Okay, so, I love the costume

03:18.849 --> 03:20.451
but I have a question
about my character.

03:20.451 --> 03:23.520
Can Mindy be spelled
with two E's?

03:24.888 --> 03:27.458
Can you turn around
for us?

03:28.225 --> 03:30.894
Can you show us
your jugular vein, please?

03:32.096 --> 03:33.597
Can you show us
how you look dead?

03:35.099 --> 03:36.667
Can you show us
how you sing dead?

03:36.667 --> 03:39.036
If I'm dead, why would I sing?

03:40.070 --> 03:41.438
Next.
Next.

03:43.138 --> 03:44.339
You're still casting?

03:44.339 --> 03:45.407
How hard can it be

03:45.407 --> 03:47.042
to find a decent
cheerleader?

03:47.042 --> 03:48.043
Rah! Rah!

03:48.043 --> 03:49.044
Sis-boom-bah!

03:49.044 --> 03:50.812
Go... team!

03:50.812 --> 03:52.681
You got the part.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.382
I don't want the part.

03:54.382 --> 03:56.251
Sorry, you should have
thought about that

03:56.251 --> 03:58.186
before you gave
such a brilliant audition.

03:58.186 --> 03:59.488
I was pretty
good, wasn't I?

03:59.488 --> 04:00.555
I guess all the years

04:00.555 --> 04:01.756
of making fun
of cheerleaders

04:01.756 --> 04:02.757
is finally paying off.

04:02.757 --> 04:05.126
So, you'll do it?

04:05.126 --> 04:07.629
Okay, but I don't
do splits, pyramids

04:07.629 --> 04:09.397
or the whole
pompom thing.

04:09.397 --> 04:10.465
Oh, no problem.

04:10.465 --> 04:11.666
I'll just have the writer
rewrite it.

04:11.666 --> 04:12.934
I will cut the splits

04:12.934 --> 04:14.936
but I am married to the pompoms.

04:16.271 --> 04:18.540
Okay, we're ready for our
first Prince of Darkness

04:18.540 --> 04:19.541
Joe Fensterblau.

04:19.541 --> 04:21.076
That's me.

04:23.378 --> 04:24.880
Nice fangs.

04:25.213 --> 04:27.148
Is there anything
about the character

04:27.148 --> 04:29.050
you want to tell me
before I start?

04:29.050 --> 04:30.318
No. Just dive right in.

04:30.318 --> 04:32.320
Actually I have
one small direction.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.156
The vampire is an extremely
conflicted character

04:35.156 --> 04:36.925
grappling with inner turmoil.

04:36.925 --> 04:38.527
On the one hand

04:38.527 --> 04:40.328
he sees Mindy
as a delicate flower

04:40.328 --> 04:41.930
who could be his life partner.

04:41.930 --> 04:44.466
And on the other hand,
he sees her as lunch. Go.

04:44.466 --> 04:50.839
Mindy, Mindy... Adelman...

04:51.039 --> 04:53.008
when I look into your eyes

04:53.008 --> 04:55.176
I-I see deep into your soul.

04:56.607 --> 04:57.975
I see hunger.

04:59.109 --> 05:02.079
I see... passion.

05:02.546 --> 05:03.547
I see we're
running late.

05:03.547 --> 05:04.548
Thanks, Joe,
for coming.

05:04.548 --> 05:05.649
We'll get
back to you.

05:09.019 --> 05:11.288
Mindy... Mindy Adelman.

05:11.288 --> 05:12.022
Next!

05:12.022 --> 05:14.258
Mindy...

05:14.258 --> 05:14.992
Next!

05:14.992 --> 05:16.126
( <i>growls</i> )
Next!

05:18.028 --> 05:19.363
Sabrina, there is no next.

05:19.363 --> 05:21.298
You just vetoed
our last lead actor.

05:21.298 --> 05:22.433
I had to.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.435
None of these guys
seems like a real vampire.

05:24.435 --> 05:25.769
Real vampire?

05:25.769 --> 05:28.505
You know,
as in the vampire who...

05:28.505 --> 05:31.942
could do justice
to your ingenious script.

05:31.942 --> 05:34.011
So you're saying
if I could somehow

05:34.011 --> 05:35.946
lower the quality
of the writing

05:35.946 --> 05:37.448
we could hire a mediocre actor.

05:37.448 --> 05:39.683
No. I'm saying the role
demands a professional.

05:39.683 --> 05:43.020
How can we get a professional
actor on a budget of $59?

05:43.020 --> 05:44.655
I know. We could put an ad
in the paper

05:44.655 --> 05:46.590
and hopefully there's
some actor between jobs

05:46.590 --> 05:47.658
that needs the exposure.

05:47.658 --> 05:49.793
Well, I suppose
if we can't get one

05:49.793 --> 05:51.228
I could play the part.

05:51.228 --> 05:52.262
We'll get one.

05:52.262 --> 05:53.897
Wait a minute.
Listen to this.

05:53.897 --> 05:55.199
"If assigned witches

05:55.199 --> 05:58.035
"can teach an entire class
to be scary in one session

05:58.035 --> 06:00.304
they are forever relieved
of scare duty."

06:00.304 --> 06:01.305
Paragraph 11.

06:01.305 --> 06:03.440
Oh, I just fell in love
with the paragraph.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.876
Zellie, you and I
wrote the book on
scaring people.

06:05.876 --> 06:08.445
Remember? <i>Scaring People</i>
by Hilda and Zelda Spellman.

06:08.445 --> 06:09.546
This will be a snap.

06:09.546 --> 06:11.348
We'll go tutor
those little tikes

06:11.348 --> 06:14.051
and then we will rush off
to Sabrina's movie set

06:14.051 --> 06:15.686
to get ready for
our close-ups.

06:15.686 --> 06:16.687
Two words:

06:16.687 --> 06:18.021
soft focus.

06:18.021 --> 06:19.022
Two more words:

06:19.022 --> 06:20.457
bon voyage.

06:20.457 --> 06:21.225
( <i>squeals</i> )

06:21.225 --> 06:23.794
Oh, when will
I ever learn?

06:23.794 --> 06:25.229
( <i>crashing</i> )

06:25.229 --> 06:27.531
I pray we get
a good response to our

06:27.531 --> 06:29.433
"desperately seeking
vampire" ad.

06:29.433 --> 06:29.867
Oh, we will

06:29.867 --> 06:30.934
especially since
we're offering

06:30.934 --> 06:32.169
free salami
in the ad.

06:32.169 --> 06:34.638
I'm going to go put these
scripts on the porch.

06:36.106 --> 06:37.174
( <i>screams</i> )

06:37.174 --> 06:39.710
Normally people
just say "come in."

06:39.710 --> 06:43.180
And I will, just as soon
as I start breathing again.

06:43.180 --> 06:44.748
Come in.

06:46.917 --> 06:48.018
Good evening.

06:48.018 --> 06:49.920
I'm Vladimir Kortensky.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.356
I hope I'm not too early
for the audition.

06:52.356 --> 06:54.625
I flew down
the Transylvania Turnpike.

06:54.625 --> 06:55.626
Literally.

06:55.626 --> 06:57.494
I like it.
Already in character.

06:57.494 --> 07:00.130
Did you get a chance
to look at the script?

07:00.130 --> 07:01.932
When I look into your eyes

07:01.932 --> 07:03.734
I see deep into your soul.

07:03.734 --> 07:04.935
I see hunger.

07:04.935 --> 07:06.470
I see passion.

07:06.470 --> 07:08.639
redemption and
resurrection.

07:08.639 --> 07:11.141
Come, let me feed
on your beauty

07:11.141 --> 07:13.610
so we may live
together forever.

07:13.610 --> 07:14.711
Okay.

07:14.711 --> 07:15.746
Miles...

07:15.746 --> 07:18.015
Sabrina, I think
we found our guy.

07:18.015 --> 07:20.184
I know.
Congratulations, Vlad.

07:20.184 --> 07:21.418
You got the job.

07:21.418 --> 07:22.653
Thank you.

07:24.521 --> 07:27.591
I look forward
to our next encounter.

07:29.359 --> 07:31.695
( <i>laughing</i> )

07:33.495 --> 07:35.430
Now, <i>that</i> is
one great actor.

07:35.430 --> 07:38.099
And mind you,
he gave that performance

07:38.099 --> 07:40.935
without even dipping
into the free salami.

07:41.102 --> 07:42.337
All right, class

07:42.337 --> 07:44.005
come to order.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.007
Let's begin by me telling you

07:46.007 --> 07:47.909
a little bit about myself.

07:47.909 --> 07:49.044
She's Zelda, I'm Hilda.

07:49.044 --> 07:50.845
We're going to teach you
how to be scary

07:50.845 --> 07:52.147
and then we're out of here.

07:52.147 --> 07:55.350
Now, the first thing you need to
learn about frightening others

07:55.350 --> 07:58.320
is the element of surprise.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.055
In other words, boo!

08:03.491 --> 08:04.826
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

08:04.826 --> 08:06.928
I said boo!

08:07.262 --> 08:09.959
Okay, I've warmed them up
for you.

08:09.959 --> 08:12.295
Let a legend show you
how it's done.

08:12.529 --> 08:14.397
Ooga-booga-booga-booga-booga!

08:16.266 --> 08:17.901
( <i>all laugh</i> )

08:17.901 --> 08:21.071
Legend...
target of humiliation.

08:21.071 --> 08:23.706
It's a fine line.

08:23.706 --> 08:25.208
In this scene,
you and Roxie

08:25.208 --> 08:27.210
have come to check
on your best friend

08:27.210 --> 08:28.445
cheerleader number two.

08:28.445 --> 08:30.447
She's not home,
so you decide to wait.

08:30.447 --> 08:32.015
It's warm
in the apartment

08:32.015 --> 08:34.184
so you start
to remove your clothes.

08:34.184 --> 08:35.652
ROXIE:
Miles, that's not

08:35.652 --> 08:36.753
in the script.

08:36.753 --> 08:38.888
I'm talking to the producer.
Sabrina!

08:38.888 --> 08:41.024
Everybody keeps their
clothes on, especially me

08:41.024 --> 08:42.892
since I'm playing
cheerleader number two.

08:42.892 --> 08:43.893
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

08:43.893 --> 08:45.295
Oh, that must be our vampire.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.761
Good evening.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.664
Wow, you sound so familiar

08:50.664 --> 08:53.500
but... I can't place it.

08:53.500 --> 08:57.171
Perhaps you've heard my
voice-over work for KFC.

08:57.171 --> 08:59.406
"We do chicken right." Bluh!

08:59.406 --> 09:00.741
Oh, that's it.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.742
Come on in.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.010
Hey, Vlad,
we're about to start

09:03.010 --> 09:04.244
the spaghetti dinner scene

09:04.244 --> 09:06.180
where the cheerleaders
carbo-load for the big game.

09:06.180 --> 09:07.581
Yeah, you know, here

09:07.581 --> 09:09.583
help yourself
to some garlic bread.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.852
Do you have something
against garlic bread?

09:11.852 --> 09:12.853
Of course he does.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.455
He doesn't want
garlic breath

09:14.455 --> 09:16.557
because he has a
love scene coming up.

09:16.557 --> 09:20.961
Ouch! Miles, your stupid script
gave me a paper cut.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.463
Now I'm bleeding.

09:22.463 --> 09:24.565
Blood?

09:24.829 --> 09:26.397
Perhaps I can help.

09:26.998 --> 09:29.467
I didn't know that paper cuts
were that interesting.

09:29.467 --> 09:31.002
They are to some of us.

09:32.503 --> 09:34.739
Morgan, can I
use your mirror?

09:34.739 --> 09:36.307
Oh, I'm not
finished.

09:36.307 --> 09:37.508
Oh, well, you
never are.

09:37.508 --> 09:39.844
But maybe Vladimir
wants to check his makeup.

09:39.844 --> 09:40.879
Uh, no need to.

09:40.879 --> 09:42.013
Okay, time for a break.

09:42.013 --> 09:43.081
We haven't started.

09:43.081 --> 09:45.183
Well, sorry, Union rules.

09:45.183 --> 09:49.387
Um, Morgan, Roxie, Miles,
have some garlic bread.

09:49.387 --> 09:51.055
I'll be right back.

09:53.291 --> 09:54.726
By the way

09:54.726 --> 09:57.929
I'll be playing
Mindee with two e's.

09:58.627 --> 10:00.362
All right,
Mr. Vladimir Kortensky

10:00.362 --> 10:02.765
let's see if there's
any information about you

10:02.765 --> 10:03.999
on the Witch Wide Web.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.000
Aha!

10:05.000 --> 10:08.404
I'm Vladimir Kortensky.

10:08.404 --> 10:10.573
I've starred in over 47

10:10.573 --> 10:12.708
Other Realm
dinner theater productions

10:12.708 --> 10:15.678
including:
<i>Don't Drink the O-Positive</i>

10:15.678 --> 10:17.980
<i>Bloodsucking</i>
<i>on the 23rd Floor</i>

10:17.980 --> 10:19.815
and <i>Same Neck Next Year.</i>

10:19.815 --> 10:21.050
I know this guy.

10:21.050 --> 10:23.252
He's in all those beer
commercials for Blood Lite.

10:23.252 --> 10:25.121
( <i>tape fast-forwards</i> )

10:25.121 --> 10:29.358
My specials skills include
juggling, rollerblading

10:29.358 --> 10:30.726
Southern accents

10:30.726 --> 10:33.863
and feasting
on the blood of mortals.

10:33.863 --> 10:38.801
I don't just play
a vampire on TV, I am one.

10:38.801 --> 10:40.002
I knew it!

10:41.504 --> 10:44.006
You have such
beautiful veins.

10:44.006 --> 10:46.876
I cannot wait to
drink your blood.

10:46.876 --> 10:49.011
You're a little devil.

10:49.011 --> 10:51.447
Not exactly.

10:53.382 --> 10:54.316
Oh, have some garlic bread.

10:54.316 --> 10:55.251
I insist.

10:56.819 --> 10:57.753
Bluh!

11:03.292 --> 11:04.059
( <i>gasping</i> )

11:04.059 --> 11:05.861
Sabrina, stop pushing
garlic bread at Vlad.

11:05.861 --> 11:09.598
Thanks to your union holiday,
we're already behind schedule.

11:09.598 --> 11:11.233
We'll get started
in a minute

11:11.233 --> 11:13.135
just as soon as I
talk to Vladimir

11:13.135 --> 11:14.803
about our big scene-- alone.

11:14.803 --> 11:16.305
What big scene?

11:16.305 --> 11:18.541
The vampire kills you within the
first five seconds of the movie.

11:18.541 --> 11:20.910
Oh, well, obviously,
you haven't read the rewrite.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.478
Oh, so now
she's a writer, too?

11:22.478 --> 11:24.280
I'll say it once--
she's not getting

11:24.280 --> 11:25.881
anywhere near
the editing room.

11:25.881 --> 11:28.551
Okay, Vlad, I just
downloaded your resume.

11:28.551 --> 11:29.685
I'm onto your big secret.

11:29.685 --> 11:31.754
Okay, so I'm
really not 22.

11:31.754 --> 11:33.856
What can I say?
It's a youth-obsessed business.

11:33.856 --> 11:34.924
Cut the quipping, Count.

11:34.924 --> 11:37.526
I know you're here
to drink my roommate's blood.

11:37.526 --> 11:40.529
I am a vampire-- it's what I do

11:40.529 --> 11:43.132
and there was an actor's strike
in the Other Realm

11:43.132 --> 11:44.366
and I needed to work.

11:44.733 --> 11:46.869
Well, buddy, you're messing
with the wrong production

11:46.869 --> 11:49.605
'cause I am a producer-
slash-actress-slash-witch.

11:49.605 --> 11:50.706
And I'm going
to zap you back

11:50.706 --> 11:52.474
to the coffin
you crawled out of.

11:52.474 --> 11:53.976
( <i>chuckles</i> )

11:53.976 --> 11:55.778
Apparently you
haven't realized

11:55.778 --> 11:58.581
that your witchy powers
do not work on my kind.

11:58.581 --> 12:01.350
Now, if you'll excuse me

12:01.350 --> 12:03.185
I have a scene to do

12:03.185 --> 12:06.322
and I'd really like to
sink my teeth into it.

12:06.522 --> 12:07.856
( <i>laughing</i> )

12:08.927 --> 12:11.129
Why couldn't we
have done a surfing movie?

12:11.296 --> 12:12.964
Zellie, we've been
at this for hours

12:12.964 --> 12:13.998
and we haven't
made any headway

12:13.998 --> 12:15.533
with these little punks.

12:15.533 --> 12:16.534
I don't understand.

12:16.534 --> 12:18.970
Maybe it just takes more
to scare people today.

12:18.970 --> 12:20.205
Hey, guys.

12:20.205 --> 12:21.206
( <i>gasps</i> )
( <i>gasps</i> )

12:21.206 --> 12:22.507
There goes
that theory.

12:22.507 --> 12:24.442
Sabrina, what
are you doing here?

12:24.442 --> 12:25.944
And who's winning the big game?

12:25.944 --> 12:27.712
I have a major problem
with the movie.

12:27.712 --> 12:28.913
We put an ad in the paper

12:28.913 --> 12:31.116
and a real vampire
showed up to play the part.

12:31.116 --> 12:33.485
Oh, and you need
a beautiful leading lady

12:33.485 --> 12:34.753
to star opposite him.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.755
No. I need to know
how to stop a vampire

12:36.755 --> 12:38.256
from sucking someone's blood.

12:38.256 --> 12:40.558
Well, Sabrina,
the only way I know
to stop a vampire

12:40.558 --> 12:43.194
is to drive a stake
through his heart.

12:43.194 --> 12:45.096
Me, I use a kabob skewer.

12:46.431 --> 12:47.932
Miles?

12:48.133 --> 12:49.134
Morgan?

12:49.667 --> 12:50.902
Roxie?

12:51.336 --> 12:52.470
Vladimir!

12:52.470 --> 12:54.272
Oh, my God, I'm too late.

12:55.807 --> 12:57.008
"Sabrina

12:57.008 --> 12:58.977
"Vladimir suggested
we head over to the school

12:58.977 --> 13:00.512
"and shoot
the blood-sucking scene

13:00.512 --> 13:01.880
while everyone is still <i>flesh."</i>

13:01.880 --> 13:03.114
Oh, wait, that's "fresh."

13:03.114 --> 13:05.817
Oh, Miles, you've got to do
something about your "r's."

13:05.817 --> 13:07.085
What am I doing?

13:07.085 --> 13:09.020
I've got to get over there!

13:10.655 --> 13:11.890
( <i>Roxie screaming</i> )

13:11.890 --> 13:13.224
Roxie! Roxie!

13:13.224 --> 13:14.392
I'm here.
I'll save you.

13:14.392 --> 13:15.093
Cut!

13:15.260 --> 13:16.594
Sabrina, what
are you doing?

13:16.594 --> 13:18.630
First you delay the start
of principal photography.

13:18.630 --> 13:21.065
And now you ruin the <i>denouement</i>
of a pivotal scene.

13:21.065 --> 13:22.867
I'm sorry, but we've got
way bigger problems

13:22.867 --> 13:25.069
than whatever that big
French word was you just used.

13:25.069 --> 13:26.070
Where's Vladimir?

13:26.070 --> 13:27.138
He's with
Morgan somewhere

13:27.138 --> 13:28.139
rehearsing a scene.

13:28.139 --> 13:29.274
Got to go.

13:29.274 --> 13:31.810
It's just as well
we're shooting it again.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.144
It doesn't
really feel

13:33.144 --> 13:35.313
like my character
would scream here.

13:35.313 --> 13:38.082
Would you mind if the
director does? Take 47!

13:38.082 --> 13:39.050
And action!

13:41.319 --> 13:44.022
Here's the plan:
strength in numbers.

13:44.022 --> 13:46.024
On three, we charge 'em.

13:46.024 --> 13:49.060
One, two... three!

13:49.060 --> 13:51.563
( <i>shrieking</i> )

13:53.932 --> 13:54.566
Get 'em!

13:54.566 --> 13:56.234
Retreat! Retreat!

13:56.234 --> 13:57.769
Retreat!

13:58.603 --> 14:00.271
What happened to
"strength in numbers"?

14:00.271 --> 14:03.541
I realized there were
three of us and 12 of them.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.410
I can't believe it--
we come to teach

14:05.410 --> 14:07.011
and we get egged
and Charmined.

14:07.011 --> 14:08.279
What's happened to us, Zellie?

14:08.279 --> 14:09.480
Why aren't we scary anymore?

14:09.480 --> 14:10.715
Living in the Mortal Realm

14:10.715 --> 14:12.584
has just taken
all the fright out of us.

14:12.584 --> 14:14.886
Get up from there,
you big scaredy cats.

14:14.886 --> 14:16.454
SALEM:
You leave cats out of this.

14:21.023 --> 14:22.258
Oh, that's it.

14:22.258 --> 14:23.692
I've had enough.

14:23.692 --> 14:25.127
I am going home.

14:25.127 --> 14:26.762
What did I just hear?

14:26.762 --> 14:30.032
My sister, one
of the scariest witches ever

14:30.032 --> 14:32.802
is thinking
of hanging up her broom?

14:32.802 --> 14:35.771
We just need to dig
deep inside ourselves

14:35.771 --> 14:38.074
and remember
what we're made of.

14:38.074 --> 14:39.275
You go, girls.

14:40.876 --> 14:43.079
( <i>loud rumbling</i> )

14:44.580 --> 14:47.016
( <i>kids gasping and screaming)</i>

14:52.488 --> 14:54.223
We're back.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.869
So what if he's an evil vampire?

14:57.869 --> 14:59.614
I'm not scared.

14:59.614 --> 15:01.249
( <i>screams</i> )

15:01.817 --> 15:02.884
Bluh, bluh...

15:02.884 --> 15:04.786
All right, Vladimir,
get your hands up!

15:04.786 --> 15:07.355
Bluh... bluh...

15:07.355 --> 15:08.757
Put a cracker in it.

15:08.757 --> 15:10.225
Two classrooms down--

15:10.225 --> 15:11.126
30 more to go.

15:11.359 --> 15:13.628
Hopefully this guy
has trouble finding a vein.

15:13.628 --> 15:17.899
You are so beautiful, and
with such a lovely neck.

15:17.899 --> 15:19.067
No, wait.

15:19.067 --> 15:19.901
Stop.

15:20.232 --> 15:22.368
I want my best side
to show for the camera

15:22.368 --> 15:23.936
so could you
bite me over here?

15:23.936 --> 15:25.104
But of course.

15:25.104 --> 15:28.541
I'm nothing if not
accommodating. Bluh...

15:28.541 --> 15:29.141
No!

15:29.575 --> 15:30.977
Spellman.

15:30.977 --> 15:32.111
Do you mind?

15:32.111 --> 15:33.512
We're trying
to rehearse

15:33.512 --> 15:35.615
and you're really
cramping my style.

15:35.615 --> 15:36.916
Well, excuse me,
but I was just

15:36.916 --> 15:38.951
trying to stop Vladimir
from sucking your blood.

15:38.951 --> 15:40.119
You can suck mine instead.

15:40.119 --> 15:41.220
What?

15:41.220 --> 15:42.288
It doesn't matter to me.

15:42.288 --> 15:43.356
I'm not a fussy drinker.

15:43.356 --> 15:44.156
It's fine with me.

15:44.156 --> 15:45.691
Well, it matters to me.

15:45.691 --> 15:46.759
What, it's not enough

15:46.759 --> 15:48.594
that you are the actor
and producer--

15:48.594 --> 15:49.996
now you have
to be the star?

15:49.996 --> 15:51.931
My director is going
to hear about this.

15:53.432 --> 15:54.533
How nice of you

15:54.533 --> 15:57.403
to sacrifice yourself
to save your friend.

15:57.403 --> 15:59.171
Yeah, well, let's
get it over with.

15:59.171 --> 16:01.107
Mmm, tasty.

16:01.498 --> 16:03.066
What is your blood type?

16:03.066 --> 16:05.735
I'd like to know whether
to have you with fish or lamb.

16:05.735 --> 16:07.837
How about with stake?

16:09.172 --> 16:11.775
I knew I should have gone
with the kabob skewer.

16:17.113 --> 16:18.748
Got to go.

16:25.855 --> 16:27.390
Two, four, six, eight

16:27.390 --> 16:29.025
who do we annihilate?

16:39.669 --> 16:41.071
Oh, that didn't work out.

16:41.071 --> 16:42.038
( <i>growls</i> )

16:42.038 --> 16:42.405
( <i>groans</i> )

16:58.154 --> 16:59.622
Looking for me, Bat Boy?

17:09.733 --> 17:11.368
I hope my HMO is paid up.

17:14.637 --> 17:15.372
Ha!

17:20.510 --> 17:21.741
Oh, look!

17:21.741 --> 17:24.110
Adams College was
basketball league
champion in '79.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.145
Isn't that cool?

17:57.177 --> 17:57.944
Ha!

18:15.328 --> 18:16.830
Now all I need
is that stake.

18:18.632 --> 18:19.833
Wrong kind of stake.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.234
Nicely marbled, though.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.569
What the heck.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.006
Bluh!

18:27.574 --> 18:29.109
I guess it's true what they say.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.111
Red meat can kill you.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.016
Sabrina,
where's Vladimir?

18:36.016 --> 18:38.652
He, uh, just sort of
vanished into thin air.

18:38.652 --> 18:40.387
You drove him away.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.722
I told you, Miles, she's
trying to destroy your film

18:42.722 --> 18:44.557
because you didn't
cast her as the star.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.226
You're an evil
cheerleader, Sabrina.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.727
Evil!

18:47.727 --> 18:49.129
No, I can explain.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.865
Actually, no, I can't.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.067
( <i>wind howling</i> )

18:56.069 --> 18:57.404
( <i>screaming</i> )

19:02.275 --> 19:03.910
Hi, honey.
Hello, sweetheart.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.045
Aunt Hilda! Aunt Zelda!

19:05.045 --> 19:06.479
What are you guys doing here?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.515
( <i>relief sigh</i> )

19:08.782 --> 19:09.816
We got our scare back

19:09.816 --> 19:11.518
and now we're ready
to be in your movie.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.586
I won't be a problem,
don't worry.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.055
I look good
from any angle.

19:15.055 --> 19:16.423
Look, I can't really
talk about...

19:17.123 --> 19:19.225
Actually, I do
have parts for you.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.695
Aunt Zelda, could you morph
back into the monster?

19:21.695 --> 19:23.063
Aunt Hilda,
you come with me.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.867
Sabrina, how'd you get
Vladimir to come back?

19:27.867 --> 19:29.336
Let's just say,
as producer

19:29.336 --> 19:31.504
I had a "big stake"
in it.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.841
Background.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.042
Booga-booga-booga!

19:36.042 --> 19:37.210
Booga-booga-booga!

19:37.210 --> 19:38.445
Action!

19:38.445 --> 19:42.282
When I look into your eyes,
I see deep into your soul.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.483
I see hunger.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.784
I see passion

19:44.784 --> 19:46.920
resurrection
and redemption.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.222
Come, let me feast
on your beauty

19:49.222 --> 19:51.458
so we may live
together forever.

19:52.125 --> 19:52.792
And cut.

19:52.792 --> 19:53.927
Perfect!

19:54.127 --> 19:54.661
I've got to reload

19:54.661 --> 19:56.696
then we'll go again
from the top.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.667
HILDA's VOICE:
Another take?

20:00.667 --> 20:01.868
That was perfect.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.002
I'm working for free here

20:03.002 --> 20:04.237
and I've got the taste

20:04.237 --> 20:06.272
of Morgan's moisturizer
in my mouth.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.341
But you're going home a star!

20:19.250 --> 20:20.685
Is there actually
a movie here

20:20.685 --> 20:22.387
or just two hours
of ego-tripping?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.188
Yeah, where's my name?

20:24.188 --> 20:25.590
Oh, there it is!

20:25.590 --> 20:27.158
Yay!

20:27.457 --> 20:28.825
Well, if you like
the credits

20:28.825 --> 20:30.393
you're going to love
the finale.

20:30.393 --> 20:33.229
Uh, I made a slight change
in the editing room.

20:33.229 --> 20:35.131
The finale is now the opening.
