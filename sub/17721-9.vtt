WEBVTT

00:01.125 --> 00:02.750
(Phones ringing)

00:07.500 --> 00:09.000
(Paper rips)

00:09.041 --> 00:10.458
- Whoa. Hey, Brent,
What are you doing?

00:10.500 --> 00:12.417
- Today of all days,
you forget to bold the title?

00:12.458 --> 00:14.250
Always bold the title.

00:14.291 --> 00:15.750
- Brent, no, they're fine.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.875
- No, they are, so, not fine.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.875
- Oh, you see that?
Dark sunglasses? Not good.

00:20.917 --> 00:23.291
Word around the office
is that Jackson dumped her.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.500
Quelle surprise.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.375
Erica: Remember that song,
"Lovers in a dangerous time?"

00:28.875 --> 00:30.583
Whenever I listen to it,

00:30.625 --> 00:32.583
I think being in love,
is always dangerous.

00:32.625 --> 00:34.333
- As you all know,

00:34.375 --> 00:36.375
Frank Galvin's Golden
anniversary is this... friday.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.166
Why isn't the title bolded?

00:40.208 --> 00:42.000
- Oh, sorry, Julianne.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.500
- Oh, well, don't apologize
to me, apologize to Frank.

00:44.542 --> 00:45.917
Because when you don't
bold the title,

00:45.959 --> 00:48.250
you're just saying
this event doesn't matter.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.750
- Sorry.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.542
- As I was saying,

00:51.583 --> 00:54.875
we will be celebrating 50 years
of our glorious leader

00:54.917 --> 00:57.792
right here, in this office,
where it all began.

00:57.834 --> 00:59.834
You can bring a guest.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.792
Dress code is formal.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.750
- Hey, I have a delivery.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.333
Oh. Oh, that's... (half laughs)

01:05.375 --> 01:07.750
Yeah.

01:07.792 --> 01:09.625
Well, someone's feeling guilty.

01:09.667 --> 01:12.250
Oh.
- Beautiful.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.208
It's from Ryan. Ryan?

01:14.250 --> 01:16.291
- Just sign right here,
Miss Strange.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.667
- Oh, um...
- That's um...

01:18.709 --> 01:20.417
That's... here, here.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.875
(Box rustles)

01:21.917 --> 01:23.458
- There you go. Sign that.

01:26.333 --> 01:27.875
- So...

01:27.917 --> 01:29.667
What if I told you
that kiss was desert?

01:29.709 --> 01:31.208
- Um, I'd say I'd probably
have to find

01:31.250 --> 01:33.166
a new, less cheesy, boyfriend.

01:33.208 --> 01:35.000
- Okay. (Laughs)

01:35.041 --> 01:37.709
What if I told you that dessert
was home-made creme brulee?

01:37.750 --> 01:39.291
- (Gasps) Creme brulee?

01:39.333 --> 01:41.000
With the sugary coating
on the on top, creme brulee?

01:41.041 --> 01:42.834
- All it takes is a torch
which I brought.

01:42.875 --> 01:44.792
I'm always prepared.

01:46.542 --> 01:48.709
- (Playful giggle)

01:51.834 --> 01:53.458
- (Shocked gasp) Ooh-la-la!

01:55.000 --> 01:56.458
(Two thumps against wall)

01:56.500 --> 01:58.375
- Mmm. Oh, that's just Ethan.

01:58.417 --> 01:59.834
It's this thing we used
to do in university.

01:59.875 --> 02:02.083
Knock once means,
"I'm indisposed",

02:02.125 --> 02:04.333
Knock twice. (knocks twice)
"come on over".

02:04.375 --> 02:06.709
- You knocked twice.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.166
- Hey, tonight's
horror movie night.

02:10.291 --> 02:12.625
Hey, Ryan.
- Ethan.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.875
- Sorry about that, I just,
I knocked one too many times.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.792
- Sorry, to interrupt, um...

02:17.834 --> 02:19.834
you can borrow this
another time.

02:19.875 --> 02:22.875
Thank you.
- All right. Yeah.

02:22.917 --> 02:25.667
- 'Night.
(Door shuts)

02:25.709 --> 02:27.500
Uh, we usually, you know,
we do dvd nights on Thursdays.

02:29.375 --> 02:31.000
- Dvd night, huh?
Like, a date?

02:31.041 --> 02:33.709
- No, I pick one week
and he picks the next.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.625
So, tell me, why are...

02:35.667 --> 02:37.417
why are you pulling out
all the stops tonight?

02:37.458 --> 02:39.583
- Why do you think?

02:39.625 --> 02:41.625
- Uh, let's see,
maybe you're feeling guilty

02:41.667 --> 02:43.583
because you're flying away
tomorrow,

02:43.625 --> 02:45.834
and leave me dateless
for my boss's very big

02:45.875 --> 02:47.917
important anniversary party?

02:47.959 --> 02:49.333
- Okay, yeah, now I feel guilty.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.917
- But, no, it's more than that.

02:51.959 --> 02:54.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah, tonight is three months
to the day that we first met.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.750
- We're celebrating three
months?

02:59.792 --> 03:02.041
- You think I'd make creme
brulee for just any old night?

03:02.083 --> 03:04.875
- No, I just thought--
- You thought I was in it
for the hot sex.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.417
No, Erica. I don't make
creme brulee just for anyone,

03:06.458 --> 03:09.000
only the ones that I...
(Goading on)

03:09.041 --> 03:11.834
- The ones that you what?
- Nothing.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.583
- Only the ones that you want
to impress with your...

03:13.625 --> 03:15.792
superb culinary skills, Hm?

03:17.500 --> 03:19.625
- Only the ones that I love.

03:21.959 --> 03:23.417
- Wow.

03:25.542 --> 03:27.625
That's, um...
(stammers looking for words)

03:27.667 --> 03:29.417
I just mean that love is uh...

03:29.458 --> 03:31.375
I mean, it's a very serious
emotion.

03:33.041 --> 03:35.000
- Ah. Sorry, I didn't mean
to put you on the spot.

03:35.041 --> 03:36.959
- No, it's-no, it's fine, Ryan.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.959
- You're not there yet.
That's...that's cool, right?

03:41.917 --> 03:44.792
- Yeah, of course.
Of course it is. Yeah.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.417
Erica: Love. It's the biggest
risk we take,

03:47.458 --> 03:49.750
and the most enduring mystery.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.291
Why we feel so powerfully for
one person and not another.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.291
- So, how's that for tasty
crunchy?

03:56.333 --> 03:57.792
- It's perfect.

- Hey, Jenny, come on in,
it's open.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.625
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.083
- So, your dress is here,

04:53.125 --> 04:54.959
Even if, technically,
it's my dress.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.959
- Thank you, you are a life
saver.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.792
- So, uh, nice-nice robe.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.875
- Thank you, it's Barbara
Strange

05:01.917 --> 05:04.166
Rosh Hashanah collection.
(Playful snarl)

05:04.208 --> 05:06.667
- (Half laughs) So, where
is Ryan off to this time?

05:06.709 --> 05:08.792
Timbuktu? Borneo? Maybe Prague?

05:08.834 --> 05:11.542
Uh, Chicago and then Vancouver.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.500
(Wine sloshes)
But before he left, he, uh...

05:14.959 --> 05:16.667
- He what?

05:16.709 --> 05:19.000
- He said the "l" word.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.667
I mean, he said that
he loved me.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.667
- Who-who falls in love
after three months?

05:23.709 --> 05:25.959
- Uh, Ryan the romantic.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.125
- Okay, what did you say
when he said...?

05:28.166 --> 05:30.083
- Mm, something terrible like,
"uh-uh-uh, love?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.041
Well, that's a,
that's a serious emotion."

05:35.083 --> 05:37.166
- Oh, sweetie, you said that?

05:37.208 --> 05:40.208
- I know. Don't make me feel
worse than I already do.

05:40.250 --> 05:43.000
Ryan, he's, I mean,
he is so great

05:43.041 --> 05:44.834
in so many ways,
but then I just...

05:46.583 --> 05:48.125
How do you know?

05:48.166 --> 05:50.625
- You are asking the wrong
girl. (knock on door)

05:50.667 --> 05:53.417
- Hey, Ethan, come on in,
it's open.

05:53.458 --> 05:56.000
- Oh, Ethan, very nice.

05:56.041 --> 05:57.750
Okay, I gotta run to yoga,
it started five minutes ago.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.583
- Thanks, Jenny.
- Bye.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.208
- Ethan, thank you so much for
coming in such short notice.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.917
I should, uh...
should probably warn you

06:05.959 --> 06:09.417
that this event is gonna be
quite high-brow.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.250
- (half laughs) I was married
to Claire for eight years.

06:11.291 --> 06:12.750
I'm used to high-brow.

06:12.792 --> 06:15.625
- Now if I could just stuff
myself into this dress.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.166
Can you, um...
- Yeah, let me help.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.750
- Thanks.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.125
(Zipper zips)

06:26.291 --> 06:28.917
- Um, so how are things
going with Claire?

06:28.959 --> 06:31.333
- Oh, um, it's uh, it's okay.

06:31.375 --> 06:35.083
It's, uh, challenging.
(Forced chuckle) Um...

06:35.125 --> 06:37.083
- What?
- (laughs) Sorry, I...

06:38.875 --> 06:40.792
- Is the dress too much?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.125
'Cause you're looking at me
like--

06:42.166 --> 06:43.917
- No, no, no, it's good.

06:43.959 --> 06:46.166
It's a great dress, actually.

06:47.917 --> 06:50.166
Um, we should probably get
going.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.000
- Sure. Yes.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.291
Lipstick...

06:55.333 --> 06:57.834
Well, thank you. You look great.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.417
- Yeah. (laughs)

07:00.458 --> 07:02.959
(Jazz music plays)

07:07.625 --> 07:09.750
(Hum of partygoers chatter)

07:12.750 --> 07:15.875
- Okay. First the roses,
and now this fierce dress.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.667
What's the deal-io?

07:17.709 --> 07:20.208
And who are you? Mr. Perfect?

07:20.250 --> 07:22.917
- Oh, no, Julianne,
This is my friend, Ethan.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.917
My boyfriend Ryan
is in Vancouver, so.

07:24.959 --> 07:26.333
- Julianne, nice to finally
meet you.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.875
- You too. Not that Erica's
ever mentioned you.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.291
- Can I get anyone a drink?
- Please.

07:32.333 --> 07:35.750
- Oh, I'd love a martini.
Make it dirty.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.834
- G&amp;T, thanks.
- You got it.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.041
- Okay so, cute, well dressed.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.583
And now for the deal breaker:
is he single?

07:44.625 --> 07:46.709
- Single? Uh... uh, no,
not exactly,

07:46.750 --> 07:48.542
he's separated from his wife.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.500
- Oh, tragic.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.959
- Twenty-four.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.917
- No, that was touch number 25.

07:56.959 --> 07:58.959
In five minutes.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.333
So, what is it about him,
do you think?

08:00.375 --> 08:02.709
I mean, he's got great eyes,

08:02.750 --> 08:04.291
I can't compete with what
God gave him.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.875
Is it his hair?

08:05.917 --> 08:07.542
Because that's something
I can do something about.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.083
- (Laughs)

08:09.125 --> 08:10.917
(Elevator dings)
- Maybe get a mullet.

08:10.959 --> 08:13.083
- Oh my God, Ryan?

08:13.125 --> 08:15.667
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be in Vancouver.

08:15.709 --> 08:18.166
- I am, I know.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.917
But then I'm sitting in O'Hare
after a crazy day of meetings

08:20.959 --> 08:23.500
and it hits me,

08:23.542 --> 08:25.125
I have more pressing matters
waiting for me at home.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.166
- Oh.

08:27.208 --> 08:28.542
- I freaked you out.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.709
- No. (stammers)

08:30.750 --> 08:33.000
A little bit, yes,
but it's not in a bad way.

08:33.041 --> 08:35.959
And, really, you didn't have
to fly back just for that.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.291
- Is that Ethan?

08:42.333 --> 08:44.875
- Yeah, I just, I couldn't
handle all the small talk
on my own.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.875
That's okay, right?

08:47.917 --> 08:50.208
- Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
More the merrier.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.041
- Good, good. Well...

08:52.083 --> 08:53.750
Uh, let me show you around,

08:53.792 --> 08:55.417
and introduce you
to some people.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.917
Explain why I have two dates.

08:56.959 --> 08:59.000
(Both chuckle)

09:06.709 --> 09:09.166
- Oh my God, she is unstoppable.
- Who?

09:09.208 --> 09:11.208
- Julianne. Everywhere I turn,
she's right there.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.125
I haven't been this groped
since Pam Simon

09:13.166 --> 09:15.125
locked me in the back seat
of her dad's grand marquis.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.208
- Aw, poor you. Julianne's
a babe.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.959
Don't ever tell Erica
I said that.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.959
- Hey, don't worry, Ryan, I
wouldn't rat you out to Erica.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.166
- Well, you are best friend.

09:27.542 --> 09:29.625
- You know, I'm just curious,
what is it you think we do

09:29.667 --> 09:31.041
when we get together?

09:31.083 --> 09:32.375
- Watch re-runs of
"Sex and the City",

09:32.417 --> 09:34.083
drink tea, and share feelings?

09:34.125 --> 09:36.250
I'm joking, buddy. Lighten up.

09:36.291 --> 09:39.458
- Mm, Erica's always been
a thorny issue with Claire.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.333
- 'Cause Erica's 3 main topics
Of conversation are:

09:41.375 --> 09:44.792
books, books, and you?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.834
No, you're just friends,
I get it.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.959
- Good. I hope so.

09:51.375 --> 09:54.208
- But you two have never...
you know?

09:56.166 --> 09:57.583
- No, never.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.583
- All this time,
15 years or whatever,

10:00.625 --> 10:03.250
You're just friends,
nothing ever happened?

10:03.291 --> 10:06.041
- Y-you know, honestly, Ryan,
I've always dated Claire

10:06.083 --> 10:08.875
Or I've been married to Claire.

10:08.917 --> 10:11.375
- But if Claire had been
out of the picture,

10:11.417 --> 10:13.834
something would've happened.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.500
- (Clears throat)

10:20.542 --> 10:23.166
- Call me paranoid,
but are you hiding from me?

10:23.208 --> 10:24.834
- Uh, just washing,
washing my hands.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.709
Look, all clean.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.667
- Come.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.208
(Bathroom door shuts)

10:34.875 --> 10:38.083
- When I published my first
book 50 years ago,

10:38.125 --> 10:40.709
I had no idea
that half century later

10:42.291 --> 10:43.959
I'd be standing here
in front of all of you.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.375
But my love of writing
remains constant.

10:46.417 --> 10:47.834
(Crowd applauds)

10:47.875 --> 10:50.542
Friends. Friends.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.500
I wouldn't be standing here
tonight if weren't for the...

10:52.542 --> 10:54.041
- (whispering) This is insane.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.917
- I know, what a life, huh?

10:55.959 --> 10:58.417
No, I mean, Julianne,
look at her with Ethan.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.500
It's like she's in heat.
- So?

11:02.542 --> 11:06.041
- So? He's married.
- Ethan is separated.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.208
Look, I want Ethan to move on
more than anyone, but Julianne?

11:10.417 --> 11:12.458
She's got all of Claire's
worst qualities,

11:12.500 --> 11:14.083
minus the cute accent.

11:14.125 --> 11:17.250
- It's none of your business,
Erica.

11:17.291 --> 11:19.166
- Oh, come--
- I'm serious.

11:19.208 --> 11:21.417
- Yeah, so am I. Let go of me.

11:22.917 --> 11:24.750
What the hell was that?

11:26.417 --> 11:29.166
- We're not doing this here.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.917
(Exhales in disbelief)

11:32.542 --> 11:34.917
Frank: ...but not when your
pages are late.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.166
Thank you.
(Guests applaud)

11:42.792 --> 11:45.375
(Elevator rings)

11:45.417 --> 11:47.250
- I need to know, Erica,

11:47.291 --> 11:50.375
are you concerned about Ethan?
Or are you jealous?

11:50.417 --> 11:52.125
- What?!
- He's walking into your
apartment.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.166
Knocking on your walls.
You two have "date night".

11:54.208 --> 11:56.375
You talk about him non-stop:
"Ethan this, Ethan that."

11:56.417 --> 11:58.208
And you know, I get it,

11:58.250 --> 12:00.417
you two have known each other a
lot longer than you've known me,

12:00.458 --> 12:02.250
but, Erica, there comes a point
when I go from understanding--

12:02.291 --> 12:04.458
- To crazy jealousy, hm?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.000
- Yes, to jealousy.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.291
I'm jealous.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.667
- What am if supposed to say
to that?

12:10.709 --> 12:12.333
- Well, look at it from
my point of view:

12:12.375 --> 12:14.542
I tell you that I love you
and you can't say it back,

12:14.583 --> 12:15.959
and-and that's okay,

12:16.000 --> 12:17.375
but then I come back here
to surprise you,

12:17.417 --> 12:18.625
and you're all dressed up
looking gorgeous

12:18.667 --> 12:20.291
for another guy.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.500
- Okay, Ethan is here
as my friend.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.250
And you couldn't tell me that
before?

12:24.291 --> 12:26.792
- No, um, I didn't feel the need
to vent my social life by you

12:26.834 --> 12:28.750
When you're on the opposite
side of the country!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.583
- Erica.

12:33.625 --> 12:36.500
You are here tonight
with another guy.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.083
A guy who I sometimes feel
that I can't compete with.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.875
At least not in any way
that matters to you.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.625
- Ryan, I don't... I mean...

12:49.667 --> 12:51.834
- I don't have feelings
for Ethan.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.291
- You're sure?

12:55.333 --> 12:57.500
You're just friends?

12:57.542 --> 12:59.542
- Yes, of course I'm sure.

13:01.959 --> 13:03.375
- You must think I'm a freak.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.125
- No, oh my God? Not at all.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.125
I should've told you
that I was coming with him.

13:09.041 --> 13:11.291
I'm sorry.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.125
We're okay?

13:13.166 --> 13:15.500
You're not gonna go out there
and punch him?

13:15.542 --> 13:17.125
- No, I'm not gonna go
punch him.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.500
We're good.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.458
- 'Kay, good. Sorry.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.333
Let's go.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.333
(Elevator rings, doors whir)

13:43.041 --> 13:45.583
(Music plays,
Low hum of chatter)

13:52.125 --> 13:54.250
- Oh, thank God.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.375
- I'm not sure if I should be
flattered or perturbed?

13:56.417 --> 13:58.083
- (Exhausted breath)

13:58.125 --> 14:00.250
I just need a little time out.

14:01.792 --> 14:03.834
- You lied to Ryan.
- I know.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.583
But what good would it be
to tell him I kissed Ethan?

14:06.625 --> 14:09.667
A kiss, I'll remind you,
which led absolutely nowhere.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.333
- Well, if it led absolutely
nowhere,

14:11.375 --> 14:13.333
then what harm could it do
to tell him?

14:13.375 --> 14:16.291
- It just would.
- Hm.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.417
You sound surprisingly sure
of that.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.834
Okay, well, imagine
if you were Ryan.
- Okay.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.667
- You tell me that you love me,
I say nothing back

14:23.709 --> 14:26.375
and then the very next day
I tell you that I kissed Ethan.

14:26.417 --> 14:28.125
- Okay, well I can understand

14:28.166 --> 14:30.542
that there could be
some jealousy that arises,

14:30.583 --> 14:32.375
but in the end,

14:32.417 --> 14:35.125
don't you think it's just
better to tell the truth?

14:35.166 --> 14:38.250
- I do. But I'm in a really
tricky situation.

14:38.291 --> 14:41.333
I mean, we're just at the start
of our relationship.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.667
And yet Ryan was able
to bare his heart and soul.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.542
Profess his love to you.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.458
Hmm. Tell me about...

14:53.500 --> 14:54.917
"Cassidy Holland".

14:56.500 --> 14:58.000
- Cassidy?

14:59.625 --> 15:01.500
What does Cassidy
have to do with any of this?

15:01.542 --> 15:02.750
I mean... (stammers)

15:02.792 --> 15:04.959
our relationship,
it was totally different.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.458
- Enlighten me.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.583
Cassidy Holland was probably
the most amazing woman

15:11.625 --> 15:14.250
I've ever met.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.792
Back in 1999, she lived
in the apartment next to me.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.792
And she was finishing
her PHD in urban planning,

15:18.834 --> 15:20.458
I was in the middle
of my masters.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.959
And our friendship,
it started off like any other.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.917
The initial "hey, hello"

15:24.959 --> 15:27.333
and then a conversation or two
and before I knew it,

15:27.375 --> 15:28.959
we became best friends.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.500
I mean, we were...
we were inseparable.

15:32.542 --> 15:34.417
And... I think in some ways,

15:35.917 --> 15:37.291
I had a crush on her.

15:38.917 --> 15:40.625
Not in all ways though
'cause Cassidy was gay,

15:40.667 --> 15:43.000
she never hid the fact that,
that she liked girls

15:44.625 --> 15:47.291
and I soon figured out
that she like me...

15:48.875 --> 15:50.625
I mean, the chemistry,
it was there.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.291
I won't... I won't deny it.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.458
Chemistry which, through
no fault of her own, at all,

15:55.500 --> 15:57.834
Cassidy misread.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.125
Because, I mean, no matter
how much I liked her,

16:00.166 --> 16:02.458
I just, I couldn't go there

16:02.500 --> 16:04.625
the way that she had wanted
me to.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.041
That night was the last night
we ever spoke.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.583
- Because you didn't share
her feelings?

16:14.625 --> 16:16.667
- No, because I crushed them.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.083
I mean, what I should've
done is,

16:18.125 --> 16:19.917
I should've gone to her
the next day

16:19.959 --> 16:21.667
(stammers)
and talked it through.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.750
But instead, I had this...

16:23.792 --> 16:25.709
this big New Year's eve party
for Y2K,

16:25.750 --> 16:28.291
and I pushed Cassidy
right out of my mind

16:28.333 --> 16:30.875
and a few months later she...

16:30.917 --> 16:33.709
she went overseas
to finish her PHD and...

16:33.750 --> 16:35.875
I never saw her again.

16:35.917 --> 16:38.500
- Okay. And if you could go
back?

16:38.542 --> 16:40.667
- I, I would be totally honest
with Cassidy.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.166
I would tell her
that I'm straight,

16:43.208 --> 16:45.333
and deal with her
expectations head on

16:45.375 --> 16:47.542
before anything would
have happened and...

16:47.583 --> 16:50.333
and save our friendship.

16:50.375 --> 16:53.250
- You know, some friendships do
just come and go though, right?

16:53.291 --> 16:55.458
- What we had was...

16:55.500 --> 16:58.792
it's one step short
of a love affair,

16:58.834 --> 17:00.917
and when Cassidy
walked out of my life,

17:00.959 --> 17:03.500
I-I felt like I lost a little
bit of my heart and my soul.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.542
- Well, I say, go back and find
them both.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.709
(Glasses shatter,
panicked squeals)

17:15.750 --> 17:17.625
Oh shit! Ah...

17:19.959 --> 17:22.208
I am so sorry. I swear,
it was a mistake.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.166
I've just...

17:25.208 --> 17:27.709
(Nervous moan)

17:27.750 --> 17:29.667
Here you go.

17:31.709 --> 17:34.083
(Machine beeps)

17:34.125 --> 17:36.750
- Denied. We take debit.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.709
- Um, I don't think that's
gonna happen. (sighs)

17:40.291 --> 17:42.625
- Don't worry, I've got it.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.458
- Cassidy.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.291
Uh, no way.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.792
(whispers) It's almost $500.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.208
- Don't thank me,
thank student loans.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.625
Ring it through.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.625
But the last time I spent
this much on crystal,

17:54.667 --> 17:56.792
she threw in a lap dance first.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.834
(Laughs)
Both: Hi.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.750
- I am gonna pay you back,
every last cent,

18:04.792 --> 18:06.583
with interest, if I have to.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.125
- Calm down,
it's not a big deal.

18:09.625 --> 18:10.959
Here... help you relax.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.875
- Thank you.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.834
- Okay, so, how do you wanna
do this?

18:14.875 --> 18:17.625
I was thinking,
Y2K in deep red,

18:17.667 --> 18:19.917
With maybe the signs
of the apocalypse all around.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.834
Throw in some circles of hell
for a little drama.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.750
- Ooh, it's very Dante.

18:23.792 --> 18:26.417
- (Laughs) You are such
a lit nerd.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.375
Both: (chuckle)

18:28.417 --> 18:30.709
(Brushes swish against paper)

18:37.583 --> 18:39.667
- Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.750
- (Laughs) What is with you?

18:41.792 --> 18:43.667
How come you're so stressed out
today, Strange?

18:43.709 --> 18:45.667
- I'm not stressed out.
I'm fine. I am fine.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.792
- You are such a liar.
I know you.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.750
I can tell, you're doing
that deer in headlights thing.

18:49.792 --> 18:51.875
- What deer in headlights
thing?

18:51.917 --> 18:54.000
- (Giggles)

18:54.041 --> 18:55.792
The whole I'm trying to make
it look like I'm thinking

18:55.834 --> 18:57.125
about what I'm doing
when actually thinking

18:57.166 --> 18:58.542
about something else? Huh?

18:58.583 --> 18:59.959
What's going on in there?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.750
- (With a laugh) Nothing.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.917
- Okay, come here.

19:03.959 --> 19:06.959
Come here!

19:07.041 --> 19:08.709
Close your eyes.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.125
- Why?

19:10.166 --> 19:11.500
- Just do it.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.583
(Tight inhale and sighs)

19:23.750 --> 19:25.917
(Startled breath)

19:30.834 --> 19:32.458
- Mmm.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.583
- Keep your eyes closed.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.542
- When I was little,

19:37.583 --> 19:39.667
my best friend and I would
paint on each other.

19:42.083 --> 19:45.500
My mom would get so mad,
but we loved it.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.709
Sitting there while someone
else draws all over you.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.959
- Cassidy, um...

19:56.542 --> 19:58.500
I'm straight.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.667
- (Exhales)

20:02.709 --> 20:04.667
Yeah, I-I know.

20:04.709 --> 20:08.000
- Sorry, I just, I don't want
to send any mixed signals.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.625
No, it's-it's cool.
It keeps everything just--

20:10.667 --> 20:12.542
- Clear.
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:14.792 --> 20:17.709
- But I have something
to tell you as well.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.542
I think you are beautiful.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.667
I'm really attracted to you.

20:31.542 --> 20:34.583
And I know that you just wanna
be friends and that's cool,

20:34.625 --> 20:37.083
but in the spirit
of being frank?

20:37.125 --> 20:39.959
I have wanted you
since the moment we met.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.333
(Dog barks in the distance)

20:51.083 --> 20:52.875
- Hope you're not a vegetarian,
Cassidy.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.041
- Oh, vegetarian-shmegetarian.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.417
I know it's trendy right now,
but if you ask me,

20:58.458 --> 21:00.583
I think people spend
too much time thinking,

21:00.625 --> 21:02.792
and not enough time eating.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.875
- So, much trouble,
just for us, Mrs. Strange?

21:04.917 --> 21:07.041
I feel very important.

21:07.083 --> 21:10.083
- Well, it's Barbara, and it
was no trouble at all. Enjoy.

21:12.959 --> 21:15.041
- New haircut, mom?

21:15.083 --> 21:17.625
- Thank you for noticing. Yes.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.125
Karl, my hairdresser,

21:19.166 --> 21:20.500
thinks I look just like
Jennifer Aniston.

21:20.542 --> 21:22.125
And I figure, if I can't have
her body,

21:22.166 --> 21:24.208
At least I can have her hair.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.709
Do you find her attractive,
Cassidy? Sexy?

21:29.083 --> 21:31.125
- Rachel's the hottest friend,
everybody knows that.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.959
- I tell you if I was a lesbian

21:34.000 --> 21:36.333
she would be the woman
I would most wanna be with.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.125
- Mom.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.041
- What? Your uncle Ruby,
my brother, is a homosexual.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.500
And I'm open-minded about it.

21:43.542 --> 21:44.959
I like to talk about these
things.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.709
- You have a gay uncle?

21:46.750 --> 21:49.208
- Yes, and he owns
a wedding dress empire.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.166
- It sort of makes you wonder
if it runs in the family?

21:51.208 --> 21:52.834
- Clearly, it makes you wonder.

21:52.875 --> 21:55.417
- Well, sweetheart, you won't
bring home a nice boy,

21:55.458 --> 21:57.583
so, what am I supposed to think?

21:57.625 --> 21:59.041
All I want is for you
to be happy.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.083
- Who says that I'm not, huh?

22:01.125 --> 22:04.125
- You know, my mom used to say
exactly the same thing, Barb,

22:04.166 --> 22:06.917
but what she really meant
was happily married to a man.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.000
You'd either live on hell
on earth or according to her,

22:09.041 --> 22:11.000
spend eternity in hell
with a capital "H".

22:11.041 --> 22:13.125
- She actually said
you were damned?

22:13.166 --> 22:14.667
- (Exhales)

22:14.709 --> 22:16.458
Yeah. Said it, meant it,
still means it.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.041
I haven't spoken to her
in ten years.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.917
I-I wish that I had half
the relationship

22:20.959 --> 22:23.291
that you have with Erica.

22:23.333 --> 22:26.750
Your, um... your daughter's
pretty amazing.

22:26.792 --> 22:29.709
She's ah, she's smart
and talented.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.875
She really helped me
when I first moved out here.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.750
Helped me, um, feel less alone
in the big city.

22:34.792 --> 22:37.250
And she's 100% straight.

22:37.291 --> 22:39.959
- Straight, lesbian,
I don't care.

22:44.709 --> 22:46.583
I really don't, Erica.

22:46.625 --> 22:49.000
How could a parent care?

22:49.041 --> 22:50.834
- Oh, mom.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.166
Seriously, mom,
you're choking me.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.583
- (teary) Oh, I'm sorry.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.166
Now, the look on my mom's face.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.083
"Your daughter's 100% straight."

22:59.125 --> 23:01.166
I thought that she was gonna
cry from relief.

23:01.208 --> 23:02.875
Both: (Laugh)

23:02.917 --> 23:04.250
And i'm really glad that
we had that talk

23:04.291 --> 23:05.625
this afternoon, you know?

23:05.667 --> 23:07.166
It just makes everything easier.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.250
You know how I feel.
- And you know how I feel.

23:09.291 --> 23:11.625
- And everybody respects
each others feelings.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.709
And I sound like such a dork.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.667
- You really do. (laughs)

23:15.709 --> 23:17.583
Okay, okay.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.875
Hot outfit, killer shoes.

23:19.917 --> 23:21.166
Aren't you glad we went home
to change?

23:21.208 --> 23:23.750
- Yes, I am.

23:23.792 --> 23:26.375
Bouncer: Id please. All right.

23:26.417 --> 23:28.709
- Uh, my friend just went in,
do you want my id?

23:28.750 --> 23:30.333
- No, I don't need to see it.

23:30.375 --> 23:33.083
- Oh, am I not dressed up
enough for your fancy club?

23:33.125 --> 23:35.625
- No, on the contrary,
you look fabulous... for 32.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.917
- And you, you look like a
reject from the village people.

23:40.959 --> 23:43.041
- Aren't you full of confidence
and sass tonight.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.834
- I forgot how much fun
Cassidy was.

23:44.875 --> 23:46.792
I mean, you should' a seen
how she took on Barb-zilla.

23:46.834 --> 23:48.750
She did-she did this thing,

23:48.792 --> 23:50.125
where she just killed her
with kindness.

23:50.166 --> 23:51.875
It was awesome.
- Look at you, all giddy.

23:51.917 --> 23:53.542
Are those butterflies
in your stomach?

23:53.583 --> 23:55.667
Are those stars in your eyes?

23:55.709 --> 23:57.250
- I'm straight.

23:57.291 --> 23:58.667
- That's what you keep saying,
yeah.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.333
- No, I am. I'm not interested
in girls.

24:00.375 --> 24:02.709
I have never been interested
in girls,

24:02.750 --> 24:04.583
but I... I am bonkers about
Cassidy.

24:06.250 --> 24:07.875
I mean, the way that I feel
when I'm with her,

24:07.917 --> 24:09.291
And the things that
we do together.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.834
- Well, that sounds wonderful.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.041
- It is.
- And yet you're straight.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.333
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so, those are...

24:15.375 --> 24:19.083
Friendly butterflies?
Friendly stars?

24:19.125 --> 24:22.083
- I can't be into Cassidy.
I'm not a lesbian.

first time I was with a guy.

31:55.375 --> 31:59.041
- My problem is, is that
you hooked up with a friend.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.000
- Why is that a problem?

32:03.667 --> 32:05.250
- Erica, there are certain
lines you just don't cross.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.667
I mean, sure, things could turn
out great,

32:06.709 --> 32:09.375
but they could also blow up
in your face.

32:09.417 --> 32:11.417
So... you're, you're telling me
that, you know,

32:13.125 --> 32:15.000
you'd never kiss a friend?

32:15.041 --> 32:17.417
- No, never.

32:17.458 --> 32:19.375
- Really?

32:19.417 --> 32:21.417
- Not unless I really meant it.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.458
Not unless I wanted to take the
relationship to the next level.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.625
So, either commit
to Cassidy 100% or withdraw.

32:30.542 --> 32:32.709
(Music plays)

32:36.208 --> 32:37.667
- Hey.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.083
- (Scoffs)

32:41.125 --> 32:42.542
Your friends, Jenny and Judith?

32:42.583 --> 32:44.250
They're so proud of you
for taking this big

32:44.291 --> 32:46.208
important step in your life.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.750
- Cassidy--
- So, what is it, Erica?

32:48.792 --> 32:50.500
Because you keep telling me
that we're moving too fast,

32:50.542 --> 32:52.333
and your friends are holding
a pride parade in your honor.

32:52.375 --> 32:53.709
- I know. And believe me,
this has become

32:53.750 --> 32:56.000
so much more complicated
than I ever intended.

32:56.041 --> 32:58.500
- You know there's a reason
I don't go for straight girls,
and this is it.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.417
So, you walk away
with broadened horizons

33:00.458 --> 33:02.208
and a sexy little story
to get your boyfriend off.

33:02.250 --> 33:04.291
And I? I walk away with nothing.

33:04.333 --> 33:07.458
Just a lot of pain, and a lot
of kicking myself in the ass.

33:07.500 --> 33:11.125
- Cassidy, I do,
I feel something for you.

33:11.166 --> 33:14.041
Yeah, you keep saying that.

33:17.417 --> 33:18.917
So, what-what are we, Erica?

33:18.959 --> 33:22.041
Because feeling something
for me is, is not enough.

33:23.750 --> 33:25.166
- I... just...

33:25.208 --> 33:28.542
Cassidy, wait. Cassidy.
Cassidy!

33:28.583 --> 33:30.709
Jenny: Erica. Hey, it's almost
time.

33:30.750 --> 33:32.166
- First the power will go out,

33:32.208 --> 33:33.500
then the water gets shut off,
and--

33:33.542 --> 33:35.375
- Oh, Ethan, enough. Okay?

33:35.417 --> 33:39.041
Come on, everyone stand,
raise your glasses. Ready?

33:39.083 --> 33:42.125
All: 10, 9, 8, 7,

33:42.166 --> 33:46.500
6, 5, 4, 3, 2...

Erica, you were right.

Why was I getting

we should talk.

Okay?

37:11.709 --> 37:13.792
- Okay, let's talk.

- You and I, we have a great
time when you're in town.

37:18.792 --> 37:20.375
- We do.

37:20.417 --> 37:22.750
And actually there's something
I wanna flip by you.

37:22.792 --> 37:24.208
- For you and me to work,

37:24.250 --> 37:25.750
it's gonna require
some sacrifices.

37:25.792 --> 37:28.166
And so far, you're the only one
doing any sacrificing.

37:28.208 --> 37:30.041
You know, you're waiting
for me to come home.

37:30.083 --> 37:32.625
You're asking Ethan...
to be your date to events

37:32.667 --> 37:34.500
where I should be your date.

37:34.542 --> 37:36.417
- Ryan--
- No, please, just hear me out
here.

37:36.458 --> 37:38.458
So... I've been thinking,

37:40.542 --> 37:42.333
I'm gonna start spending
a lot more time in Toronto.

37:44.125 --> 37:45.959
You know, I-I can't stop
traveling all together,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.542
but I can do a lot less of it.
And of course that means,

37:48.583 --> 37:50.667
I'm gonna be spending more
time in the main office,

37:50.709 --> 37:53.709
but I'll also be spending
a lot more time with you.

37:53.750 --> 37:56.959
So what do you think?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.834
- I think that-I think that
you're sacrificing too much.

37:59.875 --> 38:02.083
I mean, you're happy
with your life now.

38:02.125 --> 38:04.667
- I'm happy with you.

38:04.709 --> 38:06.667
- It's okay.

38:06.709 --> 38:08.792
I'm not ready for you
to change your life,

38:10.375 --> 38:12.125
you know, for me.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.792
- Well, what are you ready for,
Erica?

38:14.834 --> 38:16.709
- I just...

38:16.750 --> 38:19.000
Oh my God,
you're an amazing guy.

38:19.041 --> 38:20.625
- Okay?

38:20.667 --> 38:23.875
- You are.
And we have fun together.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.875
And I like you,
I really do, I just...

38:28.542 --> 38:30.917
I have to be totally
honest with you,

38:30.959 --> 38:33.709
I can't give you 100%.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.291
- I know.

38:35.333 --> 38:37.834
- And I don't think that
I ever will be able to.

38:41.583 --> 38:43.625
- It's Ethan, isn't it?

38:45.959 --> 38:48.083
Right.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.875
Ethan, wow.

38:49.917 --> 38:52.000
You know, I should've seen it
coming. And I did.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.959
Jokes on me.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.667
(Ryan whistles for a cab)

38:58.709 --> 39:00.792
- Ryan.

39:06.542 --> 39:08.792
I'm really sorry.

39:08.834 --> 39:11.083
- Yup, so am I.

39:32.625 --> 39:34.125
Erica: Love.

39:34.166 --> 39:36.542
It's a strange mixture
of alchemy and destiny.

39:38.208 --> 39:40.875
And despite all our grand ideas
about who we should be with,

39:42.500 --> 39:44.625
Love ultimately chooses
for us... every time.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.959
Hi.
- Hi.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.917
So, any emails there
from your friend?

39:50.959 --> 39:52.792
- From Ryan? No, not one.

39:52.834 --> 39:54.250
- Who's Ryan?

39:54.291 --> 39:57.125
- He's my boyf-- he's my ex.

39:57.166 --> 39:59.500
- Your ex? Why would I care
if you've heard from your ex?

39:59.542 --> 40:01.041
I'm talking about Ethan.

40:01.083 --> 40:03.250
I called him, I haven't heard
back yet.

40:03.291 --> 40:04.709
- Oh, uh... Sorry.

40:07.750 --> 40:10.917
- Well, I guess he's not
the "one".

40:10.959 --> 40:13.083
"The none!"
- Pardon me?

40:13.125 --> 40:15.583
- "The none", that's what
we need.

40:15.625 --> 40:17.375
A guide to finding "The none".
for the modern practical woman

40:17.417 --> 40:19.750
who's sick of looking for
the "one", "the none"!

40:21.291 --> 40:23.000
Ooh, I have that feeling!

40:23.041 --> 40:25.125
- So, you're okay then
about Ethan?

40:25.166 --> 40:27.041
- Um, hello? He's a teacher.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.875
(Half laughs in disbelief)

40:40.583 --> 40:42.542
(Phone rings)

40:45.750 --> 40:48.000
(Hum of traffic)

40:51.959 --> 40:53.875
- Well, you're back in one
piece.

40:53.917 --> 40:56.333
- I am. I'm not sure Ryan is.

40:56.375 --> 40:59.000
- Well, like you said to
Cassidy, "it's all or nothing".

40:59.041 --> 41:01.375
There is no prize
for second place.

41:01.417 --> 41:04.000
And generally, when you try
to force things--

41:04.041 --> 41:05.834
- It just doesn't work.
- You know.

41:05.875 --> 41:08.083
- But still, the look on Ryan's
face.

41:08.125 --> 41:09.709
- Well, imagine the look
on his face

41:09.750 --> 41:12.000
if all this would've happened
three years from now?

41:12.041 --> 41:14.041
I mean, three months is
nothing. He'll live.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.625
And so what about you, Erica?

41:19.166 --> 41:20.542
- Will I live?

41:20.583 --> 41:22.834
- Now what will you do?

41:22.875 --> 41:25.083
I mean, you couldn't give
your body to Cassidy,

41:25.125 --> 41:27.208
You couldn't give your heart
to Ryan...

41:27.250 --> 41:29.667
So, who can you give those
all important things to?

41:36.500 --> 41:38.667
Erica: They say that love
is friendship set on fire.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.709
And if you're lucky enough
to find someone

41:42.750 --> 41:45.000
you can give yourself to,
mind, body and soul?

41:47.625 --> 41:49.208
You should hold on

41:49.250 --> 41:51.041
and hope like hell
you don't get burned.

41:51.083 --> 41:52.917
(Knocking on door)

41:52.959 --> 41:55.125
- Come on in, door's open.
I'm about to score a goal.

41:55.166 --> 41:57.166
Yes! And England wins
the world cup!

41:57.208 --> 41:59.291
You wanna play? England's got a
major bone to pick with Germany.

41:59.333 --> 42:01.625
- No thanks.

42:01.667 --> 42:03.875
(Shaky breaths)

42:05.709 --> 42:08.166
- Hey, what's wrong?

42:08.208 --> 42:09.625
- Oh God, please don't do that,

42:09.667 --> 42:11.959
You're gonna make me
lose my nerve.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.750
Erica, you're freaking me out.
what happened?

42:14.792 --> 42:18.041
Is it Ryan?
- No, uh, no, we broke up.

42:18.083 --> 42:20.959
- What? Oh my God,
I'm so sorry.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.333
- Don't be, it's a good thing.

42:22.375 --> 42:25.166
I mean, it's-it's for the best.

42:25.208 --> 42:27.500
Look, this is a really
loaded statement and um...

42:27.542 --> 42:29.542
I'm gonna apologize in advance
for complicating your life,

42:29.583 --> 42:32.667
because I know you're trying
to work things out with Claire.

42:32.709 --> 42:34.709
I-I know that, I just, um, I...

42:34.750 --> 42:36.041
I have to tell you...

42:36.083 --> 42:37.917
- What?

42:37.959 --> 42:39.917
- That, uh... I love you.

42:41.834 --> 42:45.000
And not just as a friend.
In both ways.

42:45.041 --> 42:47.375
In all ways.

42:47.417 --> 42:50.834
When we kissed, that really,
um, it changed things for me.

42:50.875 --> 42:53.625
Or maybe it just showed me
what was always there.

42:58.709 --> 43:00.667
Oh, please say something.

43:02.125 --> 43:05.166
- Erica...

43:05.208 --> 43:07.250
I'm married to Claire.

43:08.750 --> 43:10.041
(Ethan's phone rings)

43:11.583 --> 43:13.125
- Yeah, I know that, um...

43:13.166 --> 43:15.709
You should-you should get that.

43:15.750 --> 43:17.709
(Phone continues to ring)

43:17.750 --> 43:19.834
Ethan, just please get that.

43:24.959 --> 43:26.917
(Phone beeps on)
- Hello?

43:28.375 --> 43:30.083
Claire, uh...

43:30.125 --> 43:33.792
Yeah, you know, um, this isn't
really a good time.

43:33.834 --> 43:36.000
Can I call you back?

43:41.834 --> 43:44.125
(Phone beeps off, door shuts)
