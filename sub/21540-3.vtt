02:04.324 --> 02:06.192
It was designed

- Closet space.
- Got it.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.501
The craziest part
about this apartment

02:14.534 --> 02:18.071
is that everything
is hidden behind doors.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.806
Oh.

Wow.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.770
So what's your plan?

02:50.804 --> 02:52.772
- So we've been
interviewing brokers.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.107
Every broker that came here

02:54.140 --> 02:58.111
said it's worth
between 12 and 13 million.

02:58.111 --> 03:02.816
- 12 to 13 million is
around $2,500 per square foot,

03:02.849 --> 03:04.050
<i>which is what the comps</i>

03:04.084 --> 03:05.652

<i>are going for.</i>

<i>Luckily for Elad,</i>
<i>I'm not just any other broker.</i>

03:09.155 --> 03:11.057
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.326
I honestly think I can
get you a lot more.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.663
- Are you thinking as high
as 14 million?

03:16.696 --> 03:18.598
- I think I can get higher.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.070
- Why?
- This apartment is so unique.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.305
There's nothing else like this,

03:25.338 --> 03:29.476
but I want you to let me
market it off-market.

03:29.509 --> 03:32.779
- So what do you think
you can bring?

03:32.812 --> 03:35.782
- I'm not gonna set a price.

03:35.815 --> 03:38.818
I'm going to tell
all of my buyers,

03:38.852 --> 03:40.687
"Tell me what the price is."

03:43.456 --> 03:44.758
- What do you mean?

03:44.791 --> 03:48.161
- I'm gonna play the buyers
against themselves.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.730
<i>I don't really think</i>
<i>outside the box.</i>

03:50.764 --> 03:52.699
I don't think
there is a box.

03:52.732 --> 03:56.970
This is a strategy to achieve
the highest possible price.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.405
- I've never had a broker
tell me that.

03:58.438 --> 03:59.773
Are you one of those brokers

03:59.806 --> 04:01.775
that's gonna just overpromise
and underdeliver?

04:01.808 --> 04:04.844
- All the buyers know
that it's off-market,

04:04.878 --> 04:07.881
but they know that it's going
to be coming to market,

04:07.914 --> 04:09.082
and they're gonna be nervous

04:09.115 --> 04:10.850
that when I put it
on the market,

04:10.884 --> 04:12.252
they could actually lose it,

04:12.285 --> 04:14.621
and they're gonna want
to give me their highest number.

04:14.654 --> 04:18.725
And from them, I'm gonna try
to build a bidding war.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.394
By not having a price,
it could be too expensive,

04:21.428 --> 04:22.929
but it might be
really, really cheap,

04:22.962 --> 04:24.330
so they'll come see it,

04:24.364 --> 04:26.132
and then I find
the person who loves it,

04:26.166 --> 04:27.467
and then I hook them.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.535
- What if somebody tells you

04:28.568 --> 04:30.170
they want to give you
$1 million?

04:30.203 --> 04:32.439
- Clearly, this place is worth
more than $1 million,

04:32.472 --> 04:34.441
but where it's worth

04:34.474 --> 04:37.377
is something
we have to figure out.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.146
- I don't know, Ryan.
I'm really not sure about this.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.582
- I think this apartment
is crazy enough,

04:42.615 --> 04:44.517
as am I,

04:44.551 --> 04:46.353
that this'll work.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.625
- I'm going to trust you.

04:52.659 --> 04:53.760
Don't let me down.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.195
- Okay.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.230
The problem is, is if it fails,

04:57.263 --> 05:00.133
<i>I will totally</i>

No pressure.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.408
like a gym, library,
pool, doorman.

09:01.441 --> 09:04.811
I think that talking about
a reduction to the owner, it's--

09:04.844 --> 09:06.046
- Let's just stop
right there.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.081
Talking about a price reduction
with the owner

09:08.114 --> 09:09.816
will immediately put them off.

09:09.849 --> 09:12.185
- Listen, if we don't give it
to them straight,

09:12.218 --> 09:16.556
they will never get it sold,
and it is our fault in the end.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.024
<i>I understand</i>
<i>where he comes from,</i>

09:18.058 --> 09:21.261
because he knows
his clients well,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.463
<i>but there's only one way</i>
<i>to be with a client.</i>

09:23.496 --> 09:25.532
It's to be honest.
It's give it to them straight.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.335
- They consider it to be our job
to sell it at that price.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.870
Do not talk about
a price reduction.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.273
-<i>But on the other hand,</i>
<i>this is not my listing.</i>

09:33.306 --> 09:34.341
<i>He brought me in,</i>

09:34.374 --> 09:37.043
and I don't want
to break his rules.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.912
So let's see the penthouse.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.681
<i>* *</i>

09:41.715 --> 09:43.049
- A really commanding space.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.819
- Very, very nice.

09:45.852 --> 09:50.590
<i>* *</i>

09:50.623 --> 09:52.659
<i>This penthouse is amazing,</i>

09:52.692 --> 09:54.894

<i>you can always ask premium.</i>

09:54.928 --> 09:56.062
<i>You have a roof.</i>

09:56.096 --> 09:59.299
It's something
magnificent, beautiful.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.533
[cell phone chimes]

10:00.567 --> 10:01.935
- Oh, it's the owners.
They're downstairs.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.803
- Okay, let's meet them.
- Let's go meet them.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.705
Ladies, hello, hello.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.173
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.208
- Hi.
- How are you?

10:08.241 --> 10:09.476
Pleasure, pleasure.
How are you?

10:09.509 --> 10:11.011
- Nice to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you, pleasure.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.679
- So we've gone
through the building.

10:12.712 --> 10:13.747
- Okay.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.948
- We've talked a bit
about the details.

10:14.981 --> 10:15.949
- Good.
- Great job.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.217
- Thank you.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.786
- We're so very proud
that we could bring something

10:19.819 --> 10:21.654
that reminds us
very much of Europe

10:21.688 --> 10:23.456
into New York.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.491
- It's amazing.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.793
So, um...

10:26.826 --> 10:28.862
my--my--

10:28.895 --> 10:30.430
I want to say it so bad,

10:30.463 --> 10:32.966
but I don't want to step
on anybody's toes.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.234
I think that, um...

10:34.267 --> 10:36.536
But it's better to ask
for permission

10:36.569 --> 10:37.671
than to ask for forgiveness.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.305
No, it's better
to ask for forgiveness

10:39.339 --> 10:40.540
than to ask for permission?

10:40.573 --> 10:41.808
I don't know the phrase.
You know what I mean.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.510
I'm going all in.
F*** it.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.311
Well, listen, I think
you've done a great job.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.915
There is one thing
that I want to speak about...

10:48.948 --> 10:51.584
the price.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.486
I think the price
on the second floor

10:53.520 --> 10:54.521
needs to be reduced.

10:54.554 --> 10:57.524
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

11:00.460 --> 11:01.728

living room,

11:12.405 --> 11:12.772
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

11:15.342 --> 11:18.078
- The one thing I do want
to talk about is, um...

11:18.078 --> 11:20.847
the price.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.582
I think the price
on the second floor

11:22.615 --> 11:24.684
needs to be reduced.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.152
<i>Whether this works or not,</i>

11:26.186 --> 11:28.355
<i>I built a business</i>
<i>being honest,</i>

11:28.388 --> 11:30.290
and I know for a fact that
this is the most important thing

11:30.323 --> 11:31.458
that we need to talk about.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.094
- This is not something
that we discussed,

11:34.094 --> 11:38.164
and I'm not
in agreement with this.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.699
This is such a unique product.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.101
- Being at 1.7 million,

11:41.101 --> 11:43.970
it's actually setting
a very big, new benchmark.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.739
- There's a price
for that kind of quality,

11:45.772 --> 11:48.141
and that's
what we need to achieve.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.578
- I agree. It's our job
to transmit that to the buyer.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.146
- So I want--I'm willing
to compromise.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.015
I think that we--you know,
we should take the penthouse

11:55.115 --> 11:57.283
off the market,
not release it.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.586
- Um, why would you not want
to release it?

11:59.619 --> 12:01.221
- We bring everybody in
to the first two.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.622
Obviously, everybody's
gonna ask, you know,

12:02.655 --> 12:04.324
"What about the penthouse?
What about the penthouse?"

12:04.357 --> 12:06.059
"We're not releasing that yet."
"Oh, really?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.594
What do you mean,
you're not releasing it?"

12:07.627 --> 12:09.362
Sort of give them
that wanting and that need.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.098
If you have a girlfriend,
all the girls are on top of you.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.134
"Oh, kiss me. Kiss me. Call me.
Why don't you call me?

12:14.167 --> 12:16.069
Oh, threesomes, ah, orgies,"
all that kinds of stuff.

12:16.102 --> 12:20.173
When you are single...
[imitates flatline tone]

12:20.206 --> 12:21.975
I don't know how to make
the sound with the "cookies."

12:22.075 --> 12:23.243
Like, the, you know, animals?

12:23.276 --> 12:24.744
Ree, ree.
- [laughs]

12:24.778 --> 12:27.080
- Crickets.
- Crickets, ah, crickets!

12:27.080 --> 12:29.549
Crickets, that's
what I was looking for.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.885
And if we actually get rid
of the first two first,

12:31.918 --> 12:34.954
that way we can use
those closing prices as a way

12:34.988 --> 12:37.424
to justify a higher increase
on the penthouse.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.563
- I think I actually
agree with you.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.733
I think it would be
a good marketing ploy right now.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.401
I think that's
a really good idea.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.970
- I agree.
There's something really special

12:51.004 --> 12:53.773
about the idea
of showing the attainable

12:53.807 --> 12:55.342
along with the unattainable.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.376
- Yeah.
Let's do it.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.678
- Let's go.
- Good.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.714
- Beautiful.
Thank you guys very, very much.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.917
I just hope that I did not
make Jordan mad

13:03.950 --> 13:06.586
by going around
what he asked me not to do.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.621
It's beautiful.
Thank you, guys.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.063
- Hurry, Jordan.
They're coming.

- Well, Ezra, hi.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.246
- Hi, how are you?
- Oh, my God, hi.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.982
This client comes from a really
wealthy family in Singapore.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.617
I love what you're wearing.

13:37.650 --> 13:41.254
And apparently when
you're wealthy in Singapore...

13:41.287 --> 13:42.288
you wear capes.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.623
It's beautiful.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.926
Welcome to the last--very
last unit at the Bleecker.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.828
I wore a cape once.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.096
You know,
one of those nights

13:50.096 --> 13:52.098
Derek and I tried
to spruce it up.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.567
I was Zorro.
He was Batman.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.571
[chuckles]

13:58.605 --> 14:00.740
O-M-G.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.043
[laughing]

14:03.076 --> 14:04.177
I'm losing it.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.846
Actually, I found it.
Let's continue.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.916
So you're in
this insane living room

14:09.949 --> 14:12.686
of this 4,000-square-
foot-plus townhouse

14:12.719 --> 14:14.220
within the building,
and look at this.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.789
Look at the size of this room.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.627
- When is it going
to be finished, Fredrik?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.062
- Well, that's the thing.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.430
We sold out so quickly

14:23.463 --> 14:25.465
that they literally didn't have
time to finish it,

14:25.498 --> 14:27.934
but it's good for you,
because if you want to,

14:27.967 --> 14:29.369
you know, change some things,

14:29.402 --> 14:31.071
maybe a different color
on the cabinetry,

14:31.104 --> 14:32.105
we can do that.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.540
A very important thing
in selling--

14:33.573 --> 14:35.075
and I think I'm pretty good
at this--

14:35.075 --> 14:37.243
is when something
is not so good,

14:37.277 --> 14:38.845
you try to make it good.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.247
And the most amazing thing about
this layout, you can choose.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.882
Do you want it open?
Do you want it closed?

14:42.916 --> 14:45.151
You can customize.
It's a good thing.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.519
The apartment isn't done.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.821
<i>And the beauty</i>
<i>of this level is,</i>

14:47.854 --> 14:49.122
<i>like, I would do</i>
<i>a wine room.</i>

14:49.155 --> 14:50.824
Do you drink wine?

14:50.857 --> 14:52.992
- Not really.
- Okay, a movie cinema?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.694
You know, really,
anything you can imagine.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.866
- Wait, what happens
in a love dungeon?

15:03.937 --> 15:07.474
- Okay,
maybe we go upstairs.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.743
So 9.5, I mean,

15:09.776 --> 15:11.878
where are you gonna find
this square footage, really?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.214
- It's a little exposed
right off the street here.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.649
- Exposed is good
when you have a big party

15:16.683 --> 15:18.485
and guests
are just walking in.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.788
Buyers don't usually prefer
a street-level apartment,

15:21.821 --> 15:24.190
but this is the last
available unit,

15:24.224 --> 15:26.359
so if you want to be
in the hottest new building

15:26.393 --> 15:29.729
in all of NoHo,
it's this or nothing.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.931
- We'll be in touch.
Good luck cleaning this up.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.701

I know it's empty,
but we're not gonna stage,

pretty quickly.

It's amazing.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.744
- Beautiful glass staircase.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.713
- Beautiful.
- A lot of white.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.148
Don't take it personally.
- It's not my place.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.050
- Oh, my gosh,
look at this outdoor space.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.419
- Perfect for dinner parties.
- Yeah.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.155
- Haven't put it
on the market yet,

16:29.189 --> 16:31.057
so somewhere between 10 and 20.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.060
- 10 and 20?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.428
- That's a little vague.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.931
- Should I just pick somewhere
along that line?

16:37.964 --> 16:40.066
- Yeah, I guess so.
- [laughs]

16:41.735 --> 16:43.636
- But we won't have
a listing price.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.307
<i>I know this is</i>
<i>a really risky strategy.</i>

16:47.340 --> 16:48.708
<i>I mean, it could</i>
<i>totally backfire,</i>

16:48.742 --> 16:51.478
but on the other hand,

16:51.511 --> 16:53.179
it could really, really work,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.615
because without
a set asking price,

16:55.648 --> 16:57.517
<i>brokers and buyers</i>

16:57.550 --> 16:59.552

When I was gonna
price it here,

17:27.914 --> 17:29.549
designed specifically
for them by Boffi.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.117
It's a 13-foot island.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.652
- Ryan,
we can see the apartment,

17:32.686 --> 17:34.054
so let me just show my client.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.321
- Okay.
- I just know what he wants.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.892
- Do--you got it.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.161
So upstairs we'll find
outdoor space.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.696
We have one bedroom here,

17:42.729 --> 17:45.331
and down here
is your entire master.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.068
So I guess we're going outside.

17:48.101 --> 17:51.638
Okay, great.
I'm totally useful as a broker.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.073
- What do you guys think?
- I like it.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.307
I like what I see.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.709
- Do you feel
like it's big enough?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.477
- What's the square
footage again?

17:57.510 --> 18:00.780
- The exterior is--
- It's just under 17.

18:00.814 --> 18:04.484
- Well, it's actually
1,662, right?

18:04.517 --> 18:05.685
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.

18:05.719 --> 18:08.455
- Well done.
You're on top of your stuff.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.723
So I got to go.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.458
- You want to see the master
or the bathroom?

18:11.491 --> 18:12.659
- I think we're good.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.094
I think this is what we really
wanted to see.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.595
How much is this
gonna cost us?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.063
What do you think, Ryan?

18:17.097 --> 18:18.164
- We haven't priced it yet,

18:18.198 --> 18:19.699
so we haven't brought it
to the market.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.668
We'll price it
somewhere between,

18:21.701 --> 18:24.270
like, 10 and 20.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.772
- That's a really broad range.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.707
It's gonna be priced
between 10 and 20?

18:27.741 --> 18:29.642
- Yeah, you can just do
the calculations

18:29.676 --> 18:30.643
and send me an offer.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.045
- Thanks.
- Just--okay.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.546
- Lovely.
- Good to meet you, by the way.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.717
I want to start planning
our open house.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.652
I think that we should bring
the Manhattan buyer,

19:12.686 --> 19:15.889

you know, very, very casual,

19:15.922 --> 19:18.491

You know, jeans, T-shirts.

I'm thinking of it very--
being very neighborhood,

19:27.600 --> 19:29.769
because it's something
that lacks a little bit

19:29.803 --> 19:32.505
in Manhattan, 'cause everything
moves too quickly, too fast,

19:32.539 --> 19:35.108

more laid-back.

We will.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.408
you, like, didn't want
to see anything.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.210

someone comes back

His offer is 8.5 million,

22:57.110 --> 23:00.714
to also build
a pool downstairs.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.810
I really do think so, because
it's an open construction site.

26:50.844 --> 26:53.646
The crew is there,
and it'd probably cost half,

26:53.680 --> 26:55.749
like, 250,000,
to put in the pool now.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.083
I mean, you dig a little bit.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.918
You know, you add
some plumbing, and it's done.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.587
He really wants the pool.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.355
If this deal doesn't happen,

27:02.389 --> 27:05.325
the next buyer could come in
and have the same request,

27:05.358 --> 27:07.694
and then it's gonna cost him
double to rip it up.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.362
Work with me.
Obviously, he's coming up.

27:09.396 --> 27:11.197
You know, he said it was
an opening offer at 8.5,

27:11.231 --> 27:13.566
and now he's come to 8.8;
just give me the number.

27:25.679 --> 27:28.548
- Hi.

27:28.581 --> 27:30.684
I got the pool.
- What?

27:30.717 --> 27:33.119
- I got the pool.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.320
- How much?

27:37.123 --> 27:40.360
- My buyer needs to have
an 8 in front of it.

27:40.393 --> 27:42.462
- I got you the pool.
That was very difficult.

27:42.495 --> 27:45.065
Can you get him
to nine, honestly?

27:45.098 --> 27:47.734
- Truthfully, I don't know.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.703
- We are so close.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.272
I am so close
for a complete sellout.

27:52.305 --> 27:54.341
I've been working
this project for years.

27:54.374 --> 27:56.910
If I can do this deal,
I'm sold out this week.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.311
Do you want me to text him?

27:58.345 --> 28:01.014
- I'm texting,
if you would stop talking.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.183
He said he'll get--oh.

28:03.216 --> 28:05.485
- Oh? What's the text?

28:05.518 --> 28:09.723
These damn texts.
What is it?

28:09.756 --> 28:11.491
- He's so excited.

- This is amazing.
- Great.

29:50.457 --> 29:53.193
and the sellers are pushing me
to accept it,

29:53.226 --> 29:57.197

given me a 24-hour timeline.

It's okay. You know, good thing
I brought my Manhattan people.

31:30.390 --> 31:32.392
So we have three residences.

31:32.425 --> 31:35.161
We have released on the market
the first two: the second floor,

31:35.195 --> 31:36.496
and we have
the garden residence,

31:36.529 --> 31:37.997
which is the one
that we're standing here now.

31:38.098 --> 31:40.734
- You've got Venetian plaster
accent walls.

31:40.767 --> 31:43.136
- But this is a 3-bedroom,
2 1/2-bathroom,

31:43.169 --> 31:44.471
1,800 square feet.

31:44.504 --> 31:46.473
- Their kitchen's
all imported from Italy.

31:46.506 --> 31:47.874
- Oh, that's nice.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.110
- They are very deep,
and they're already built in.

31:50.110 --> 31:51.911
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's insane.

31:51.945 --> 31:54.881
This is why, you know, I wanted
to have brokers from Manhattan.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.282
You cannot find
anything like this

31:56.316 --> 31:57.417
for less than 2,000 a foot.

31:57.450 --> 31:59.352

It's close to 1,200 square feet.

32:01.054 --> 32:02.655
Yes?

32:03.757 --> 32:04.891
- No, not today.

just so everybody knows,

32:06.693 --> 32:07.927
the penthouse is not
on the market,

32:07.961 --> 32:08.962
and we're not showing it today.

32:10.497 --> 32:11.965

Come on.

for the penthouse.

- Oh, man, you're making me want
what I can't see.

you that one. All right.

- And I'll tell you what;
the garden is fantastic,

32:32.185 --> 32:34.220

the penthouse.

36:55.949 --> 36:58.451
It could be what I'm wearing,
but why is this coming up now?

37:01.454 --> 37:03.023
- At what price?

37:11.097 --> 37:12.699
- What about Jared,
my broker?

37:16.369 --> 37:18.171
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

37:18.204 --> 37:20.874
not this deal, not Jared.

37:20.907 --> 37:22.809
<i>Oh, no.</i>

37:22.842 --> 37:24.911
How am I gonna
explain this to Jared?

37:24.944 --> 37:28.748
There's nothing I can do
and nothing Jared can do either.

37:28.782 --> 37:30.750

Ooh, look, falling leaves.

37:49.069 --> 37:51.371

but it's not
all good news for Elad.

38:01.214 --> 38:03.016
That $14 1/2 million offer

38:03.016 --> 38:07.554
that we had last week
when we met...

38:07.587 --> 38:09.923
I lost it, but I--

38:10.023 --> 38:11.491
- I don't even
know what to say right now.

38:11.524 --> 38:14.027
After everything we talked about
last time, you just say,

38:14.027 --> 38:15.662
"Oops, it's gone?"

38:15.695 --> 38:17.030
- I didn't just say, "Oops."

38:17.030 --> 38:18.264
I just wanted
to tell you, and--

38:18.298 --> 38:20.033
- We hired you because you were
supposed to be the best.

38:20.033 --> 38:21.234
What am I gonna say
to my client?

38:21.267 --> 38:22.836
I look like an idiot.
- I mean, I--

38:22.869 --> 38:24.938
- It's done.
We're done.

38:25.038 --> 38:26.106
- What do you mean?

38:26.139 --> 38:28.408
- We're not doing business
with you anymore.

38:30.677 --> 38:32.212
- Wow.

38:32.245 --> 38:34.514
- We're gonna look
for somebody else.

38:37.050 --> 38:38.952
- I don't need
the listing anymore.

38:39.052 --> 38:43.423
I don't even need it,
because I sold it.

38:43.456 --> 38:44.457
Yeah.

38:44.491 --> 38:47.060
- Wha--for how much?

38:47.093 --> 38:49.262
- 15 1/2.

38:49.295 --> 38:51.064
- 15 1/2 million?

38:51.097 --> 38:54.167
- 15 1/2 million

He honestly just didn't even
give me a second to talk

39:04.077 --> 39:08.415
before he decided to terminate
my entire contract.

39:08.448 --> 39:11.785

I'll start with good news.

that's good,

39:27.334 --> 39:29.069
and then I think
that we should just make sure

39:29.102 --> 39:30.904
we get those other buyers
in ahead of time.

Sorry,
I was looking for you.

39:33.573 --> 39:35.575
- Sorry.
- Let me talk to you.

39:35.608 --> 39:36.910
- What's going on?

39:36.943 --> 39:38.345
- Can I just
exchange a few words,

- Well, it's kind of urgent.
For you, I mean, yes.

about our deal?

39:44.751 --> 39:46.186

39:46.219 --> 39:48.054
- All right, you guys,
can you give us a minute?

39:48.054 --> 39:50.423
- Sorry, guys.
I need one minute.

39:50.457 --> 39:52.726
In real estate,
you get so much practice

39:52.759 --> 39:54.627
to deliver bad news,

39:54.661 --> 39:59.265
but yet to this day,
13 years later,

39:59.299 --> 40:01.901
it still makes me nervous
to walk in

40:01.935 --> 40:04.904
and tell another fellow broker
that it's not happening.

40:04.938 --> 40:06.106
How do you say that?

40:06.139 --> 40:07.640
Have you been
to this store, by the way?

40:07.674 --> 40:10.844
The--it's, like,
a Japanese dog store.

40:10.877 --> 40:12.746
- No, my dogs are English.

40:12.779 --> 40:15.382
- Mm. Okay,
so this is the deal.

40:15.415 --> 40:17.050
Oh, God, it's not easy.

40:17.083 --> 40:18.752
- What is going on?

40:18.785 --> 40:22.922
- Mansion,
$9 million with a pool,

40:22.956 --> 40:24.891
it's not happening.

40:24.924 --> 40:26.226
- What do you mean?

40:26.259 --> 40:30.630
- My developer gave someone
in the building already

40:30.663 --> 40:33.466
an option to pick up
this last piece

40:33.500 --> 40:36.202
and combine with other units.

40:36.236 --> 40:37.637
The point is,
why I'm coming to you--

40:37.671 --> 40:39.105
- So even if we were
to revoke the pool,

40:39.139 --> 40:40.473
we still couldn't get it done?

40:40.507 --> 40:41.775
- No, it's over. It's over.
It's done.

40:41.808 --> 40:43.076
- What if we came in
with more money?

40:43.109 --> 40:44.377
- You don't understand.

40:44.411 --> 40:45.945
They have the right
to exercise the option or not.

40:45.979 --> 40:47.047
- And you did not
tell me that?

40:47.080 --> 40:48.148
- He was out.

40:48.181 --> 40:49.683
He decided not
to exercise the option.

40:49.716 --> 40:51.618
It wasn't gonna happen,
so I went ahead with you,

40:51.651 --> 40:53.420
but then all of a sudden
he picked it up.

40:53.453 --> 40:55.422
- Of course, but, Fredrik,
I have my guy lined up.

40:55.455 --> 40:57.424
I got him to pay the price
that you and I negotiated.

40:57.457 --> 40:58.858
- I know, but it's nothing
I can do. It's not--

40:58.892 --> 41:00.560
- And if there is
a slight chance

41:00.593 --> 41:04.497
that someone has the right
to an option, however unlikely,

41:04.531 --> 41:06.733
you should have
at least told me.

41:06.766 --> 41:09.135
-<i>I know Jared is angry,</i>
<i>and he's trying to blame me,</i>

41:09.169 --> 41:12.305
but every single deal
has 100 contingencies,

41:12.339 --> 41:15.075
and it's none of his business
or his buyer.

41:15.075 --> 41:17.644
We don't disclose
all the contingencies,

41:17.677 --> 41:19.713
especially when
they're a year old.

41:19.746 --> 41:21.815
- That's, like,
a huge disappointing call

41:21.848 --> 41:22.949
I have to go make, and I--

41:22.982 --> 41:24.584
- It's not my fault.
- Fredrik--

41:24.617 --> 41:26.419
- I'm--listen,
this is important to me,

41:26.453 --> 41:28.221
'cause you understand
a sellout is a sellout.

41:28.254 --> 41:30.190
I'm excit--I'm done.
It's sold out.

41:30.223 --> 41:32.125
But it doesn't feel
like a total win,

41:32.158 --> 41:34.828
because you're upset,
and I don't want that,

41:34.861 --> 41:36.930
and I know how it feels.

41:36.963 --> 41:39.899
I can see that.

41:39.933 --> 41:41.768
I'm sorry.

41:46.573 --> 41:49.275
- As disappointing as this is,

41:49.309 --> 41:50.744
I think you're here

41:50.777 --> 41:54.247
because you understand
the position that I'm in,

41:54.280 --> 41:57.951
so, you know, we will
continue to do business

41:57.984 --> 41:59.786
together in the future.
- Really?

41:59.819 --> 42:02.822
- I believe everything happens
for a reason,

42:02.856 --> 42:06.259
and there's no point
of crying over spilled milk.

42:26.212 --> 42:27.781
You have dogs, right?

42:27.814 --> 42:31.217

something later.
