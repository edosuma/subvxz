00:02.160 --> 00:03.570
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.760 --> 00:06.650
You have the ability to keep living
inside someone else's body.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.730
Katherine Pierce has permanent control
of Elena Gilbert's body.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.606
I want my daughter, I want immortality
and I want Stefan Salvatore.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.406
I know how bad I screwed up. I need you.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.204
We're over.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.360
Why would Nadia compel me?

00:21.560 --> 00:23.483
I need a crash course on
Elena Gilbert...

00:23.680 --> 00:27.082
and I figure, who knows her better
than her compellable best friend?

00:27.280 --> 00:30.489
So tell me.
Now that you slept with Klaus, how was it?

00:30.680 --> 00:32.205
Oh, my God.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.602
- And you are?
- My backup.

00:38.800 --> 00:43.806
Wes has this sick little scheme to destroy
vampires by making them feed on each other.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.487
I can see how this might be a problem.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.523
Do you think that fellow loved
milking cows?

01:16.600 --> 01:18.409
Probably. Then she became one.

01:18.640 --> 01:22.884
So he drank himself into oblivion.
She cheated with the pastor.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.120
Just because you lost your true love
doesn't mean you have to dump on others.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.886
There's no love in there.
Look at that picture. It's old.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.889
The milk maid's nowhere to be found.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.971
- It's just pathetic old Farmer John.
- Manners.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.731
It's impolite to speak ill of our hosts.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.242
- Doubt he'll mind
- Somebody's cranky.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.482
It's been almost eight hours
since you last fed, so that's about right.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.001
You timing me?

01:47.200 --> 01:50.010
You feed on vampires now.
I am a vampire.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.522
Only way to assure my safety is to know
how long you last before your next fix.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.042
- Or you could just leave.
- I don't abandon my friends, Damon.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.688
If you hadn't come with me
to kill Dr. Wes...

01:59.880 --> 02:02.281
he wouldn't have stuck you
with that nasty virus.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.281
Ah, just in time.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.887
- Hello.
- What did you do?

02:08.080 --> 02:10.208
- What's happening?
- Uh, you died...

02:10.440 --> 02:14.411
but luckily, you had my blood in
your system, so when you drink this...

02:14.600 --> 02:16.329
you'll feel much better.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.724
There you are.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.284
Attaboy.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.208
- What was that?
- That was blood.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.050
You're a vampire. Congratulations.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.163
- I'm a what?
- I know. It's overwhelming...

02:34.360 --> 02:38.160
and Damon will explain more in a bit,
but before he does, settle a bet.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.521
Your wife, where is she?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.046
Wait.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.006
- I drink blood now?
- Again, we'll explain everything.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.726
- Where's your wife?
- She's gone. She left me years ago.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.365
Pastor.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.727
Pastor?

02:50.920 --> 02:52.604
- Pharmacist.
- Ah.

02:52.960 --> 02:57.921
Yes. I will take that
as a win for me, not for you.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.802
Stop trying to scare me, Damon.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.367
I'm not leaving you.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.642
The only friend you have left.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.205
- "Roman Empire."
- Four seventy-six AD.

03:32.440 --> 03:33.487
Sacked by the Goths.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.523
- "Han dynasty."
- Two twenty AD.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.964
- "Holy Roman Empire."
- Not really an empire, but 1648.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.921
- There goes your perfect score.
- What?

03:43.120 --> 03:45.168
No. That was right.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.364
No, no. The book says, uh, "1806."

03:48.560 --> 03:51.404
Okay. Well, 1806 may
technically be right...

03:51.600 --> 03:57.721
but it was the Peace of Westphalia that truly
ended the empire, and that was in 1648.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.490
Trust me.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.845
I may have done a paper on
the Holy Roman Empire in high school.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.523
Well, if you wanna pass the test, I suggest you
write down exactly what's in the textbook.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.041
Caroline's here. I asked the sheriff
to help me track down Damon.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.846
<i>Heh.</i>

04:19.839 --> 04:22.764
You were right. He's off the rails,
and this is from my mom.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.764
Missing persons and animal attacks?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.287
Check and check. There's something else.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.886
All the victims were found
inside their homes without their head...

04:32.120 --> 04:34.726
and their skin was desiccated.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.131
Damon's feeding on vampires.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.803
- I shouldn't have let him go.
- No. Uh-uh. No.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.921
You are not turning Damon's roosting
chickens into a Stefan Salvatore guilt trip.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.566
No one could've stopped him
going after Wes the other night.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.482
I guess Wes must've injected him with
whatever he was gonna give Elena...

04:58.680 --> 05:01.650
- ...that makes vampires feed on vampires.
- Good news, bad news.

05:01.840 --> 05:05.162
Bad news is when this happened
to Jesse, we had to kill him...

05:05.400 --> 05:07.562
but the good news is...

05:08.880 --> 05:12.168
I'm sorry. Usually, there's some good news.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.129
I have to find him.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.560
Well...

05:17.760 --> 05:20.127
- ...I can come with you.
- Elena. Hey.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.084
I didn't know that you were here.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.046
- Well, Stefan has been helping me study.
- Oh, Stefan, who doesn't go to college.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.685
Stefan, who's an expert in history.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.804
Uh-huh. Um...

05:31.240 --> 05:33.288
It's Tyler.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.689
I haven't really spoken to him
since the, um...

05:36.880 --> 05:37.927
incident.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.885
The incident? You mean the time
where he almost killed you.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.007
<i>Hey-</i>

05:45.200 --> 05:47.089
- Have you talked to Matt?
- No. Why?

05:48.360 --> 05:51.284
Because it turns out Nadia's
compelling him to forget things.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.960
<i>Matt said he'd avoid her,
but I haven't heard from him.</i>

05:54.200 --> 05:55.850
Well, do you think he's in trouble?

05:56.120 --> 05:58.771
He hasn't been at home or work, and his
cell phone goes straight to voice-mail.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.651
- Okay. I'll come right over...
- That's not why I called.

06:01.880 --> 06:05.009
No. I know, but I think that we can
figure this out together.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.281
I'll see you soon.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.725
- Maybe I should come with you.
- No, you deal with Damon.

06:10.920 --> 06:11.967
We can handle this.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.401
Besides, it's time we move into
the next phase...

06:14.640 --> 06:17.803
of our post-breakup, pre-friendship
relationship timeline.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.604
I'm gonna stay out of that one.

06:19.800 --> 06:24.328
I'm gonna get some clothes,
and you'll pick me up at my dorm?

06:24.520 --> 06:25.885
Sure.

06:28.160 --> 06:32.961
Bad news is Tyler hates you,
but the good news is...

06:33.320 --> 06:35.448
- Mm.
- It'll be fine.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.847
We both have weird ex-...

06:38.080 --> 06:39.525
friend situations.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.441
We? There's nothing weird going on
between Elena and me.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.962
Come on. First she tells you
she's gonna fight to get Damon back...

06:47.160 --> 06:53.167
and then she re-breaks up with him, and
now she's here with you, her ex, studying?

06:53.360 --> 06:56.728
She's here with her friend studying.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.888
Without the implied quotes.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.082
Look. I'm just saying that...

07:01.280 --> 07:05.649
Elena and Damon's break-up is messy,
and you are not messy.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.081
You, you're stable and sane, and...

07:08.320 --> 07:10.800
I'm about to spend 12 hours
in a car with her alone...

07:11.000 --> 07:14.482
so whatever she's feeling,
I'm sure I'll be able to figure it out.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.685
What's going on with Matt?

07:19.560 --> 07:20.846
- Nothing.
<i>- Really?</i>

07:21.080 --> 07:25.483
Because Goldilocks and the Big Bad Wolf are
meeting to powwow about him as we speak.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.324
Fine.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.011
Matt found out about you.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.007
- He what?
- Tyler gave him vervain.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.690
- Kill him.
- Katherine.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.166
Kill him now.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.409
He doesn't need to die.
The vervain will be out of his system...

07:41.640 --> 07:44.291
and I've kept him out of sight,
he hasn't told anyone.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.126
So you two have just been tucked away,
canoodling?

07:47.360 --> 07:49.169
I don't even know what that means.

07:49.400 --> 07:53.200
We all love Matt Donavan, otherwise,
he would've been dead a long time ago.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.688
But when it comes to keeping
my new doppelganger body a secret...

07:56.880 --> 07:58.484
nobody is that important.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.722
I am going out of town with Stefan...

08:01.920 --> 08:04.241
because he wants to find Damon.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.044
I thought you wanted Damon
out of the picture?

08:06.240 --> 08:07.890
Ugh.

08:08.080 --> 08:12.290
I do, but I saw an opportunity to be alone
with Stefan for a few days...

08:12.480 --> 08:15.006
and, well, I took it.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.771
And what happens when you get too close?

08:17.960 --> 08:19.007
Too comfortable?

08:19.200 --> 08:22.124
What happens when you slip up?
Kill your precious Stefan too?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.687
Using my own words against me.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.644
Now, that's a Petrova specialty.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.289
Take care of the Matt issue before I get back
into town, or I'll have to do it myself.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.640
It'll be fine.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.047
I just need to convince my friends
I'm okay.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.691
I'll keep your secret.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.803
No one has to die.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.606
Relax.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.208
I'm not going to syrup you to death.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.771
What's canoodling?

09:04.720 --> 09:06.927
Didn't realize you liked
to play with dolls.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.441
Well, my brother likes to make a big show.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.769
Set them up, put their heads back on.
Pretend like it didn't happen.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.645
I, on the other hand, don't give a crap.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.561
Well, we've got eight hours
till you need to feed again.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.089
I wonder, what's New York like these days?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.562
- Crowded.
- Perfect.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.125
Let's go.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.329
Oh, what is that?

09:31.440 --> 09:34.887
Obnoxious theme song of the Travelers.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.845
Oh...

09:43.160 --> 09:44.446
No...

09:48.240 --> 09:51.961
As a man of science,
I always considered magic a cheat.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.491
Turns out...

09:53.680 --> 09:55.011
I cheat.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.248
- How's the appetite?
- Funny you should ask.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.680
I was just craving a blond.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.525
You're my patient zero, Damon.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.764
Couldn't let you ride off
without running a few tests.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.611
- A few tests.
- Well, one test.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.326
Now that you're trapped
with only one source of food...

10:09.520 --> 10:12.683
how long can you go before you feed
on your best friend?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.283
You ever think about getting a new car?

10:28.520 --> 10:30.841
What are you talking about?
This car is a classic.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.202
Yeah, and so is the
Wright Brothers' plane...

10:33.440 --> 10:36.410
but you don't see people
still flying around in that thing.

10:36.600 --> 10:41.083
You know, uh, I appreciate you
being here, but...

10:41.320 --> 10:43.607
- ...you didn't have to come.
- I told you.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.131
I'm doing this for you.

10:45.520 --> 10:49.081
Because you're still holding on to the hope
that maybe this is the time...

10:49.280 --> 10:50.725
that Damon can be saved.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.009
And you don't think he can.

10:54.440 --> 10:58.843
Look. I know that he crossed the line
with Jeremy, but you know, he's...

10:59.040 --> 11:00.929
crossed many lines before.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.203
You mean when he actually killed Jeremy.
Yes, I recall.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.006
I'm just saying you've never really...

11:07.200 --> 11:08.850
closed him off like this before.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.121
I mean...

11:10.320 --> 11:13.244
obviously, I still care about Damon.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.882
I guess I got my hopes up too many times.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.846
I want off the emotional rollercoaster
that is Damon's redemption, you know?

11:20.040 --> 11:22.088
It's just... It's dizzying.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.331
Are you hungry? Because...

11:25.520 --> 11:28.330
- ...I'm starving.
- Um, sure.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.488
- What do you want?
- Whatever you're having.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.411
But with a lot more salt
and maybe covered in chocolate?

11:33.840 --> 11:35.569
Coming right up.

12:09.720 --> 12:10.926
Give it up, mate.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.288
Those Travelers sealed
this place up tight.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.721
- This spell can't last forever.
- Doesn't need to.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.122
Wes only needs it
to last eight hours, remember?

12:18.320 --> 12:21.927
Then he can come back inside
and autopsy my mangled corpse.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.330
Damn it.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.969
You're pretty Zen about all this.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.085
Did you forget
everything I taught you in that cell?

12:34.280 --> 12:36.442
Calmer heads will always prevail.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.604
Always the soldier.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.366
But you do have people we can call.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.800
Like your brother...

12:46.000 --> 12:47.365
or your ex.

12:47.560 --> 12:51.167
Who can, in turn, find Wes
and threaten him or maim him.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.647
Or anything that doesn't involve
your fangs on me.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.844
My brother told me to leave
and not come back. I'm not calling.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.003
So my life is not worth your pride.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.645
- They won't come.
- Or they will.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.571
Then you might hurt them.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.202
You don't wanna risk that, do you?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.006
Me, on the other hand...

13:08.640 --> 13:10.369
I'm not gonna feed on you.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.730
I'll find another way.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.244
Thank you.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.731
Mm. It's good coffee.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.849
Although, I usually take mine
with a little more awkward silence.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.283
Nice try, but you don't take anything
with silence.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.849
So, Matt...

13:49.400 --> 13:51.721
- ...um, he's missing?
- I don't know if he's missing.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.242
He just hasn't been home in two days,
and he's not answering his phone.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.086
Matt?

14:00.200 --> 14:02.123
Caroline, what are you doing here?

14:02.440 --> 14:05.728
Kind of wondering the same thing.
Where the hell have you been?

14:05.920 --> 14:08.446
Did I give you my sunglasses? Oh.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.927
I thought you said they wouldn't be home.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.561
Okay, rewind. Start over.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.649
This whole time, you've been with Nadia?

14:18.840 --> 14:20.285
It's a long story.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.410
Nadia, come on in.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.645
Oh, man...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.363
- Can you hold this for a second?
- Yeah.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.728
- Careful. It has grease on it.
- Oh, okay.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.888
I have no idea how this hose ripped out...

14:38.080 --> 14:41.084
but we can't go anywhere
until I get a new one.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.764
I guess I'll see if that
mechanic has a spare.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.082
You weren't careful at all.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.402
What? What?

14:54.240 --> 14:55.765
I love this shirt.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.883
You loved that shirt.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.686
Great.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.484
Awesome. That's just...

15:01.680 --> 15:02.806
awesome.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.607
- Now there's grease all over your face.
- What?

15:08.560 --> 15:14.010
Well, you got all that engine stuff on you,
and I clearly have to change.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.610
I saw a hotel, like,
a couple streets down that way.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.484
Do you think we should get a room...

15:20.680 --> 15:23.923
so that we can shower
while we're waiting for the car?

15:24.120 --> 15:28.921
No, I should probably stay here
in case they finish early, but you can go.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.531
Give them your phone number.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.644
I assume your phone does receive
incoming calls, right?

15:33.840 --> 15:35.888
Or is it from the Han dynasty,
like your car?

15:36.120 --> 15:37.690
That's funny.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.284
Will you grab my bag?

15:47.720 --> 15:49.245
Sure.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.329
I'll be right there.

15:55.400 --> 15:59.564
I was on my way out of town, and then
there she was, sitting on the front steps.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.410
Waiting for me.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.847
Subtlety's not my strong suit.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.605
I felt bad about compelling him
and bad about snapping your neck.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.325
Again, subtlety.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.966
So why haven't you been answering
your phone?

16:13.200 --> 16:14.406
I lost it the first night.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.489
- First night where?
- Atlantic City.

16:16.680 --> 16:22.403
- I'd never been. Neither had Matt.
- One drink led to three, then to five, and then...

16:22.600 --> 16:23.886
rest is kind of a blur.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.408
- Yeah, because she's compelling you.
- Caroline, I'm wearing vervain.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.409
She's not compelling me.

16:30.680 --> 16:31.886
Where have you been the last two days?

16:32.080 --> 16:33.923
She's not compelling me.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.560
- We're having fun.
- Oh.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.605
Fun. Just like the time
she buried you alive.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.211
Whoo. Pop open the champagne.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.971
I thought you said she'd be cool
with us hanging out.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.046
And what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

16:46.560 --> 16:50.360
It means you've done nothing but judge Matt
since he walked through that door.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.451
When everyone knows you're not exactly
winning friends with your romantic choices.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.724
Isn't that right, Tyler?

16:57.880 --> 17:00.201
I don't wanna be a part of this.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.450
She's just trying to get under our skin
to distract us.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.883
Yeah. From what?
This is Matt we're talking about.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.082
Did you forget that time
he went to Europe with Rebekah...

17:15.280 --> 17:19.001
- ...after she ran his truck off the road?
- You're not seriously buying all this?

17:20.079 --> 17:22.765
A lot easier to buy than other things
that have happened.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.809
What did you do?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.207
Bring your entire closet?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.890
Well...

17:44.120 --> 17:47.044
I didn't know how long we'd be gone,
and to be honest...

17:47.240 --> 17:50.687
Damon's spirals require a little more
than an overnight bag.

17:52.080 --> 17:56.210
We'll get him back.
He's hurt but he's not a lost cause.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.444
- What makes you think that?
- I know what he's going through.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.364
What do you mean?

18:03.600 --> 18:06.649
You don't know what it's like
being in love with you.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.608
You know, when you and I were together...

18:09.800 --> 18:14.362
every single atom in my body told me
that it was a right thing.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.608
That we were the perfect fit.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.406
And that kind of love,
it can change your whole life.

18:20.440 --> 18:24.161
And then when somebody who made you
feel that way suddenly stops...

18:24.640 --> 18:27.325
the vacuum is just...

18:29.240 --> 18:30.810
I get it.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.844
I built a whole prophecy around it.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.968
He's not handling it right, but...

18:38.160 --> 18:39.685
he's not gone.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.082
You need a refill.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.481
I should go wash up.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.691
Okay.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.281
Towing chains.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.811
A farmer's best friend.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.610
In about an hour, mine.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.084
Take a seat.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.368
They're not gonna let us out of here
until I kill you.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.049
- Or you kill me.
- Don't be dramatic.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.804
We'll work something out.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.684
There's no cure, Enzo.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.201
- Not for this.
- You've given it all of two days.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.484
That's what you do, isn't it?

19:35.680 --> 19:37.011
There's a problem, you run.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.680
You did it to me, you
did it to your girl...

19:39.880 --> 19:41.848
Because when I stay, I destroy things.

19:49.240 --> 19:52.244
We're not all as fragile
as you think we are.

19:58.720 --> 20:01.326
- What the hell are you doing?
- Calling for backup.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.249
I thought I told you not to call.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.051
I told you, your pride isn't worth
either of our lives.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.924
- Oh, my God, Damon?
- Hello, Stefan.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.447
Wonderful to hear
your beautiful, feminine voice.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.445
Enzo. What the hell do you want?

20:31.640 --> 20:33.051
I'm in a spot of trouble.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.084
- Where's Damon?
- Oh, he's here. Salivating.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.171
About to chomp into my neck
until my head pops off...

20:39.360 --> 20:42.091
in a grotesque
but slightly comical fashion.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.761
- Wes <i>infected him?
- You know about the virus? Good.</i>

20:46.960 --> 20:48.246
We could use a hand.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.444
Wes enlisted some singing witches
and trapped us in the house.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.802
Do not come here.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.601
He doesn't wanna risk feeding on you.
Kind of sweet, really, but he'll be fine.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.962
If he feeds on you, I
have orders to kill him.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.406
Okay, um...

21:05.600 --> 21:09.047
text me the address. To my phone,
and we'll be there as soon as we can.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.409
Fine. Oh, and ticktock.
I've managed to restrain him...

21:12.600 --> 21:15.281
but you know how persistent Damon
can be when he wants something.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.367
<i>We'll be there soon.</i>

21:19.000 --> 21:21.844
- You say something?
- No. Heh.

21:29.520 --> 21:30.601
You'll be all right.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.122
- They'll come and we'll sort something out.
- Or I'll feed on them.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.401
Those are also options.

21:35.640 --> 21:36.971
As long as I live, I'm good.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.322
Joking. Kind of.

21:43.280 --> 21:46.011
- If you were aiming for my heart, you missed.
- I wasn't.

21:46.640 --> 21:51.601
Chains were a good idea. Now I can see
exactly how strong he becomes when enraged.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.250
Very strong.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.965
Boy, do I miss that indestructible
Augustine cage right about now.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.046
Damon, stop. Damon.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.281
Please, Damon. Stop.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.727
Damon, stop.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.046
Stop it, please.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.805
Damon.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.566
What did you do to him?

22:39.760 --> 22:41.967
My friends raised the acidity
of your blood.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.242
There must be some witch-y
explanation for it.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.522
Damon was basically drinking
hydrochloric acid.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.922
I suggest you leave
before the spell wears off.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.724
And go where? With you?

22:50.960 --> 22:52.928
There's one more thing I need from you.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.088
Then I'll let you go for good.

22:55.800 --> 23:00.647
The other option is to stay in here with your
cannibal friend and see how long you last.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.650
Go, Enzo.

23:03.160 --> 23:06.209
- I tried to kill you. I'll do it again.
- No.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.729
Go, Enzo!

23:29.400 --> 23:30.526
Car's done.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.081
I'll be right there.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.245
Hey, um...

23:56.600 --> 23:58.443
would you mind grabbing me my shirt?

23:58.680 --> 23:59.727
It's the...

23:59.920 --> 24:02.241
- The green one right on top.
- Yeah, sure.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.082
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.481
Wait a minute. Wait.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.121
Maybe this is...

26:01.440 --> 26:03.488
This is wrong. We...

26:04.760 --> 26:06.125
You and Damon just split up.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.004
You don't have to, um...

26:08.640 --> 26:10.449
You're right. I...

26:10.640 --> 26:12.483
I'm sorry. I was just in the moment.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.770
I shouldn't have.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.445
Yeah...

26:20.720 --> 26:23.610
We have a long night ahead of us, so...

26:23.800 --> 26:26.087
- ...maybe we should...
- Yeah. No...

26:27.120 --> 26:29.009
You know, why don't you go...

26:29.200 --> 26:32.921
settle the bill, and
I'll finish packing.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.329
Who do you think Stefan loves more?

27:04.520 --> 27:06.841
Damon or Elena?

27:07.040 --> 27:08.326
Why are you calling me?

27:08.560 --> 27:11.484
Damon has been infected
by the Ripper virus.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.523
And I know exactly where he is.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.969
So if I can get Damon to attack me...

27:17.160 --> 27:21.370
the only way to save me
would be for Stefan to kill him.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.006
You want to make Stefan kill his brother?

27:24.640 --> 27:27.644
- Dark. Even for you.
- Thank you.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.567
So how goes it with Matty Blue-Eyes?

27:30.800 --> 27:33.201
- Dead <i>yet?</i>
- Still working on it.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.087
Good luck with your plan to win
Stefan's love.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.210
So...

27:42.400 --> 27:43.561
I'm curious.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.320
- We spent a few days together now...
- Canoodling?

27:46.640 --> 27:49.007
Canoodling. Exactly.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.647
And it seems like you went through
this trouble to save your mom, but...

27:52.840 --> 27:54.683
she only seems interested in Stefan.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.806
That's Katherine.

27:57.160 --> 28:00.130
I didn't expect mother-daughter
boozy brunches.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.124
Yeah, but you did expect something.

28:02.360 --> 28:05.603
- Are you going to play a card, or what?
- Look. I've been where you are.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.643
My mom used to disappear for weeks...

28:07.840 --> 28:10.161
then show up, like nothing happened.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.045
Before you know it,
I'd be making her a grilled-cheese.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.924
- This isn't like that.
- Isn't it?

28:15.120 --> 28:17.168
She decides when you're worth it...

28:17.360 --> 28:19.408
on her watch, but guess what?

28:19.600 --> 28:22.922
You're never gonna be as interesting
as the next guy she wants.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.807
Matt...

28:25.000 --> 28:27.082
you'd say anything to help Elena.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.851
- I'm not an idiot.
- You are if you think Katherine's...

28:30.040 --> 28:32.247
gonna choose you, because she's not.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.570
Do you know why you found yourself
making all those sandwiches?

28:36.760 --> 28:39.411
Because the second your mom walked
back into your life...

28:39.600 --> 28:41.602
you forgot those horrible things
she did.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.490
Because at the end of the day...

28:43.880 --> 28:46.281
she's still your mom...

28:46.760 --> 28:47.966
and you love her.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.722
Give me your wrist.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.048
The vervain is gone.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.366
Our fun is over.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.647
Wait.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.649
Since I'm gonna forget this anyway...

29:22.680 --> 29:23.886
What was that for?

29:24.080 --> 29:25.286
Thank you.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.166
If I'm gonna be threatened and held
against my will...

29:28.360 --> 29:30.522
I can think of worse scenarios.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.690
What the hell?

30:05.040 --> 30:08.601
What did you expect? Elena's my best friend.
I'll always protect her.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.689
It just sucks.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.928
You were the only decent person
in this town.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.366
And I still am...

30:14.560 --> 30:15.607
and so are you.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.722
You could've killed me and you didn't.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.288
You're not like her and you know it.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.161
Forget everything
you're not supposed to know.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.722
We partied, we slept together, then I left.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.081
Good bye.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.442
Going somewhere?

30:45.040 --> 30:46.087
Actually, I am.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.080
And you're in my way.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.284
Matt, are you okay?

30:50.480 --> 30:52.482
Yeah. Why, what's going on in here?

30:52.680 --> 30:54.648
Well, you texted me from Nadia's phone.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.080
So you compelled him again.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.009
And they say blonds are dumb.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.602
What are you doing to him? Tell me.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.081
Nadia, stop.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.089
You may not remember, Matt...

31:09.280 --> 31:10.884
but this is your fault.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.360
Trust me.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.521
Young hybrid beats old vampire every time.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.964
Wait a second. Does anyone wanna tell me
how this is my fault?

31:42.320 --> 31:43.924
Elena.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.050
Don't.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.845
Do not.

31:52.520 --> 31:55.000
Don't... I said don't.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.683
You come in here, you ain't coming out.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.370
What exactly happened here?

31:59.680 --> 32:01.330
I wanted revenge.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.568
I got stuck with a vampire virus.
Almost killed my last friend.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.010
Typical Damon.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.251
Enzo texted me the address here.

32:11.440 --> 32:14.011
- Damon, we're here to help you.
- You can't help me.

32:14.240 --> 32:17.130
I feed on vampires now.
You're both vampires.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.284
Do yourselves a favor and leave.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.130
Well, that's not gonna happen.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.210
Stay back.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.801
I'm not afraid of you, Damon.

32:47.720 --> 32:48.801
Neither am I.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.087
No, no, no.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.170
You gotta get out.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.841
What the hell is wrong with you?

33:05.320 --> 33:09.120
I'm proving to you that you're not
a lost cause, Damon.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.211
Elena.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.925
See?

33:26.240 --> 33:27.526
Damon.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.410
You can resist this.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.726
You can do it.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.604
Why? Because you love me.

33:32.800 --> 33:37.647
And that love is stronger
than any craving.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.361
Get away from me, Elena.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.607
He's gonna kill you.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.325
No. No, he's not going to.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.445
He's not going to.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.086
You can do this, Damon.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.406
Fight it.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.762
There you go. Turn around.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.689
There you go.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.283
Damon, stop. Damon, let go of her.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.323
- Let go of her.
- Stefan.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.483
Let go.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.329
He's going to kill me.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.404
Here. Look over here. You smell that?

34:22.600 --> 34:23.681
Feed on me, not her.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.245
That's good.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.010
That's good. Feed on me.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.407
Feed on me.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.250
Feed on me.

34:47.840 --> 34:51.481
Well, the only thing Matt remembers
is that they slept together.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.045
Well...

34:58.040 --> 34:59.246
So...

35:01.240 --> 35:02.685
Care...

35:05.240 --> 35:06.844
I never said "sorry."

35:07.240 --> 35:09.208
I was pissed, but...

35:10.240 --> 35:11.287
no excuses.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.891
Okay?

35:14.160 --> 35:16.049
Look. We could get past this together.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.369
Okay? I just want us to be good again,
you know?

35:20.560 --> 35:22.324
I said I was sorry.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.409
- I didn't say I was past it.
- Of course.

35:24.640 --> 35:27.769
Obviously. I mean, Rome wasn't built
in a day.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.084
How evolved do you think I am?

35:33.280 --> 35:35.408
You slept with Klaus.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.682
You slept with the guy that killed my mom.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.490
What's a fair amount of time for me
to get past that?

35:41.840 --> 35:42.887
A week?

35:43.080 --> 35:44.161
A month?

35:44.400 --> 35:46.801
- Tell me. What sounds right to you?
- Okay.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.365
You made your point.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.130
Look.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.606
I'm not trying to be a dick.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.609
But the idea of us being good...

35:54.120 --> 35:55.645
it's not gonna happen.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.127
Understood.

36:26.920 --> 36:30.845
I know you can't help yourself,
but if you bring home a rabid animal...

36:31.080 --> 36:32.764
you're gonna get bit.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.247
I never should've told you to leave.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.283
I'm gonna kill you, Stefan.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.690
Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but at
some point, I'm gonna rip open your throat...

36:48.000 --> 36:49.604
and you're gonna die.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.609
Oh, come on, Damon.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.764
You think I'm afraid of a Ripper?

36:53.960 --> 36:55.644
Who do you think invented the word?

36:55.840 --> 36:59.686
Know that feeling when you're around
vampire blood? That burning in your veins?

36:59.880 --> 37:01.882
I feel that on a daily basis.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.650
And there's a way to control it.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.921
And let me guess.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.726
It would bring you no greater pleasure
than to teach me.

37:07.920 --> 37:11.925
No. It's a good guess, but right now I'm gonna
go get you a little bit more vervain...

37:12.160 --> 37:14.527
and then I'm gonna have a drink.

37:14.720 --> 37:19.203
I'm gonna let you think about what a royal
pain in the ass you've been lately.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.644
You're my brother.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.481
I'm not gonna give up on you.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.810
I never will.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.650
She has.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.323
- You talking about Elena?
- Mm.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.451
She practically got herself killed
to prove a point today.

37:36.640 --> 37:40.440
The vampire Ripper, Jesse.
When he attacked me, Elena had to kill him.

37:40.640 --> 37:44.247
But if there was the slightest chance
there was another way to stop him...

37:44.440 --> 37:45.726
she would've taken it.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.841
- Yeah, so?
- She knew it would be impossible for me...

37:49.040 --> 37:52.010
to resist her blood,
and then she just kicked you a stake.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.322
Essentially told you to kill me.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.681
So, what are you saying?
You saying that, uh...

37:58.920 --> 38:01.366
Elena wanted me to kill you?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.684
You got another excuse?

38:17.320 --> 38:19.049
That's what I thought.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.085
Well...

38:39.280 --> 38:41.806
I could use a steak.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.485
You're chipper.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.205
That must mean Damon is dead.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.481
Not quite.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.849
In fact, he continues to be
the bane of my existence.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.644
But...

38:53.240 --> 38:55.083
Stefan and I had a moment.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.489
Don't worry. I'll keep
the details to myself.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.411
But it definitely reaffirmed
his feelings for Elena.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.011
L.e., me. Heh.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.646
So it's only a matter of time.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.601
Sounds like you're going to get
everything you want.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.768
Of course I will.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.322
Assuming you took care
of the Matt situation.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.567
Your secret is safe.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.084
Perfect.

39:19.480 --> 39:22.165
So I'm in a really good mood right now...

39:22.360 --> 39:26.285
which means I don't really feel like
worrying about whatever's making you mopey.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.926
You won't have to worry about me
for much longer.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.403
What's that supposed to mean?

39:35.240 --> 39:36.890
Tyler Lockwood bit me.

39:47.240 --> 39:48.401
Hey.

39:48.600 --> 39:52.082
- When did you get here?
- About one and a half of these ago.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.851
You were right.

39:55.040 --> 39:58.965
I brought this on myself. I knew the Klaus
thing was going to come with consequences.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.762
I guess now I just have to deal with it
and learn from my mistakes.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.565
Glad I could help.

40:04.760 --> 40:07.491
- So did you find Matt?
- Yes, and Tyler was right.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.842
Nadia's been compelling him
to forget things.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.605
- What kind of things?
- Who knows?

40:11.840 --> 40:14.241
He tried to message me,
but Nadia stopped him.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.363
"Help K" was all I got.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.488
So you and Elena?

40:23.120 --> 40:25.885
- What's the verdict?
- Um, well...

40:26.080 --> 40:27.969
the verdict is...

40:28.640 --> 40:30.085
she's acting strange.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.882
- She kissed me.
- Excuse me?

40:33.080 --> 40:37.608
Yeah. My car broke down, so we got a hotel
room so she could shower, and...

40:38.160 --> 40:40.162
You guys got a hotel room?

40:40.360 --> 40:42.283
- With a shower?
- But it wasn't like that.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.528
I stopped it.
I couldn't do that to Damon.

40:44.760 --> 40:45.807
Yeah, but she could.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.250
I just... I don't get it.
She knows that this would destroy him.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.922
- What is...? What is she doing?
- That's what I mean. It's like she's...

40:53.120 --> 40:54.201
given up on Damon.

40:54.400 --> 40:58.166
And he thinks that she was trying
to get me to kill him tonight.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.921
No. I mean, she may be mad at him,
but she would never want him dead.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.326
Unless...

41:06.440 --> 41:10.047
Matt texted you "Help

41:10.400 --> 41:12.562
before Nadia stopped him.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.288
"K" as in Katherine.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.448
And when Katherine was dying...

41:17.640 --> 41:21.804
Nadia figured out a way to put
Katherine's spirit inside Nadia's body.

41:22.040 --> 41:25.249
Yeah, but that didn't happen
because Katherine had a change of heart.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.565
No.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.044
No. You don't think that...

41:32.280 --> 41:33.850
it's...

41:34.040 --> 41:37.044
No, it's impossible that she...

41:37.920 --> 41:39.046
But we would've noticed.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.050
It's Elena. We know her.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.202
Oh, my God.
