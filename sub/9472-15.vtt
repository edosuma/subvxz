00:07.640 --> 00:09.507
This week on <i> Vice,</i>

00:09.609 --> 00:12.943
the water crisis that's poisoning
the people of Flint, Michigan.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.512
All:
Flint lives matter!

00:17.884 --> 00:21.752
People are dying.
Who want to be next? Not me.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.722
So this is the Flint
Water Treatment Facility,

00:24.824 --> 00:27.959
which is where they failed to
treat the water for corrosion,

00:28.061 --> 00:29.995
which led to the entire lead crisis.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.796
It's all right.

00:31.898 --> 00:34.532
And then the rise of ISIS in Libya.

00:36.803 --> 00:38.970
This place is completely annihilated.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.206
<i>This is what the sharp end
of the US war</i>

00:41.308 --> 00:43.208
<i>on ISIS in Libya looks like.</i>

00:44.777 --> 00:46.777
Libya is on the brink

00:46.880 --> 00:49.214
of falling into chaos.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.505
Over the past year,

01:13.606 --> 01:15.206
America looked on in disbelief

01:15.308 --> 01:17.375
as the water crisis
in Flint, Michigan, unfolded.

01:17.477 --> 01:21.479
Today, President Obama declared
Flint, Michigan, a disaster area.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.215
Smith: <i>It didn't seem possible
that in the 21st century,</i>

01:24.317 --> 01:26.084
<i>Americans' lives could be at risk</i>

01:26.186 --> 01:28.653
<i>because of the water
coming from their taps.</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:30.055
Government failed you.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.557
Hillary Clinton:
<i>The governor of that state</i>

01:32.659 --> 01:34.526
acted as though
he didn't really care.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.928
Recently, both state
and city officials

01:37.030 --> 01:38.796
<i>have been brought up
on felony charges</i>

01:38.898 --> 01:41.832
as the people of Flint continue
to feel the after-effects

01:41.935 --> 01:44.035
of this story of mismanagement,

01:44.137 --> 01:46.371
corruption
and cover-ups.

01:46.473 --> 01:51.342
Flint lives matter!
Flint lives matter!

01:56.216 --> 01:57.315
We're here at the state capitol

01:57.417 --> 01:58.849
where Governor Snyder
is going to be giving

01:58.952 --> 02:00.285
the State of the State address,

02:00.387 --> 02:02.153
but there are hundreds
and hundreds of protesters

02:02.255 --> 02:05.590
from across Michigan who don't
care what the governor has to say.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.359
In fact, they just want to
send him a very clear message

02:08.461 --> 02:09.926
and they want him gone.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.338
I just want to know... what are
you carrying in your hand?

02:36.789 --> 02:38.756
All:
Flint lives matter!

02:38.858 --> 02:42.059
Shihab-Eldin: <i>Flint, Michigan,
is surrounded by 1/5</i>

02:42.162 --> 02:44.129
<i>of the world's
surface drinking water.</i>

02:44.231 --> 02:47.132
<i>But in 2013, Governor
Snyder's emergency manager</i>

02:47.234 --> 02:49.300
<i>made the inexplicable decision</i>

02:49.402 --> 02:52.170
<i>to switch the city's water
supply to the toxic Flint River</i>

02:52.272 --> 02:54.772
<i>to save money, leading to one</i>

02:54.874 --> 02:56.741
<i>of the most severe
public health crises</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:58.409
<i>in the United States</i>

02:58.512 --> 03:01.646
<i>and criminal charges
for city and state officials.</i>

03:01.748 --> 03:05.216
So this is the Flint
Water Treatment Facility,

03:05.318 --> 03:07.818
which is where they treat
the city's water supply.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.488
But when they made
the switch over from Detroit,

03:10.590 --> 03:12.857
which came from a lake,
to the Flint River,

03:12.959 --> 03:14.825
where the water is more corrosive,

03:14.927 --> 03:17.295
they failed to treat
the water for corrosion,

03:17.397 --> 03:19.631
which led to the entire lead crisis

03:19.732 --> 03:21.732
that the city is now facing.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.136
We're at the limit?

03:27.240 --> 03:29.774
Shihab-Eldin: <i>Most of the facility
is off-limits to visitors.</i>

03:29.876 --> 03:33.144
<i>But even here, the water
appears to be undrinkable.</i>

03:43.723 --> 03:45.723
<i>To find out just how dangerous</i>

03:45.825 --> 03:47.425
<i>improperly treated water can be,</i>

03:47.527 --> 03:49.960
<i>we met with the scientist
who first exposed</i>

03:50.063 --> 03:52.630
<i>the alarming levels of lead
in Flint's water.</i>

03:52.732 --> 03:56.501
What specifically caused
the lead in the water in Flint?

03:56.603 --> 03:58.936
The lack of corrosion control.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.939
The Flint River
had more chloride in it.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.642
So when this corrosion
inhibitor was not added,

04:04.744 --> 04:07.011
as required by Federal law,

04:07.113 --> 04:09.280
it was allowing
the chlorine to disappear

04:09.382 --> 04:11.182
and allowing bacteria to grow.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.050
And one of those bacteria
was to Legionella.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.152
Reporter: <i>State officials
say the new cases</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:16.688
<i>push the total number to 91,</i>

04:16.789 --> 04:18.988
<i>with 12 deaths during 2014.</i>

04:19.091 --> 04:20.958
We actually predicted
it would happen.

04:21.060 --> 04:24.429
We said, "If you do not have
corrosion control

04:24.531 --> 04:25.996
"in a system like Flint,

04:26.099 --> 04:27.779
"you'd expect to see
a Legionella outbreak.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.800
You'd expect to see
people dying."

04:30.704 --> 04:31.864
<i>Unfortunately, that prediction</i>

04:31.904 --> 04:32.803
<i>proved to be true.</i>

04:32.905 --> 04:35.072
<i>The water was eating holes</i>

04:35.174 --> 04:36.841
<i>in the lead pipe.</i>

04:36.943 --> 04:39.176
<i>The water was leaching lead.</i>

04:39.279 --> 04:41.078
And Michigan's Department
of Environmental Quality

04:41.180 --> 04:44.181
and the EPA... did they actively
try to discredit you or others

04:44.284 --> 04:46.517
when you were bringing this
to the public's attention?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.253
Oh, yeah, we had to fight them.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.688
We had to fight the very agencies

04:50.790 --> 04:52.189
we pay to protect us.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.260
And we now know
that they knew about this

04:55.362 --> 04:58.095
for, you know, a good 18 months

04:58.197 --> 05:00.965
and were completely working overtime

05:01.067 --> 05:03.768
to make sure no one
would find out about it.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.137
There's no doubt in your mind
this was a cover-up?

05:06.239 --> 05:09.140
Oh, no question. I mean, the
lies that they were telling

05:09.242 --> 05:11.208
to cover this mistake up...

05:11.311 --> 05:13.978
if this isn't criminal,
I don't know what is.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.448
Shihab-Eldin:
<i>As outrage continues</i>

05:17.550 --> 05:19.617
<i>against the officials
who allowed this to happen,</i>

05:19.719 --> 05:22.754
<i>we spoke to the now-former
mayor of Flint, Dayne Walling,</i>

05:22.855 --> 05:24.789
<i>who personally flipped the switch</i>

05:24.891 --> 05:26.991
<i>that started this crisis.</i>

05:28.361 --> 05:31.996
I pushed the button
that closed the valve

05:32.098 --> 05:34.098
so that water from the Detroit system

05:34.200 --> 05:38.102
was no longer flowing
in the water-treatment plant.

05:38.204 --> 05:42.607
<i>It was like cutting a ribbon
at a... at a new business.</i>

05:42.709 --> 05:46.110
And, you know, I look
back on that with regret

05:46.212 --> 05:47.712
every single day.

05:47.814 --> 05:51.015
You told reporters the city's
water is safe to drink.

05:51.117 --> 05:54.652
All of our tests,
ever since this year,

05:54.754 --> 05:57.789
have been comparable with what
we used to get out of Detroit.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.425
How did that come to be?

06:00.527 --> 06:04.295
I mean, it feels as though
it was obvious.

06:04.397 --> 06:08.866
I... I believed it was true
when I said it.

06:08.968 --> 06:13.404
And it was true... it was accurate
with the information I had.

06:13.506 --> 06:17.442
But it wasn't...
it wasn't right.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.844
Shihab-Eldin: <i>Lee-Anne Walters
was the first resident</i>

06:19.946 --> 06:22.580
<i>to push for an investigation
into the water system</i>

06:22.682 --> 06:24.982
<i>she knew was harming her family.</i>

06:25.084 --> 06:26.517
My family's been exposed to lead.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.252
One of my children has been poisoned.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.455
Beginning of June,
I developed this lovely rash.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.656
Wow.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.024
It has never gone away since.

06:34.126 --> 06:35.760
My kids started developing rashes.

06:35.862 --> 06:39.029
And we didn't know... understand,
like, what was going on.

06:39.131 --> 06:41.599
We noticed that he started
complaining of headaches,

06:41.701 --> 06:43.468
giving us a hard time eating.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.537
My son will be five in March.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.939
He weighs 36 lbs.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.609
His twin is 53.

06:51.711 --> 06:56.547
How do you sit by watching the
people who put you in office,

06:56.649 --> 07:00.150
showing you rashes
all over their body,

07:00.253 --> 07:04.856
hair loss... your constituents bringing
in all this discolored water,

07:04.957 --> 07:06.691
begging you for help,

07:06.793 --> 07:08.760
and how do you say you didn't know?

07:08.862 --> 07:11.962
I... I'm deeply,
you know, sorry

07:12.064 --> 07:16.000
for what's happened
with Flint's water crisis,

07:16.102 --> 07:19.003
for everyone who's been
affected by lead

07:19.105 --> 07:21.305
and all the other issues
that we've had.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.974
The emergency managers
were put in place

07:24.076 --> 07:26.176
with this austerity framework.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.580
It was "cut services,
raise fees."

07:29.682 --> 07:34.419
And that was the best
that the governor

07:34.521 --> 07:37.688
and state were willing
to offer a place like Flint.

07:37.791 --> 07:41.258
We happen to be a largely
African-American city,

07:41.360 --> 07:45.530
a city where there's a high
concentration of poverty.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.197
And that's wrong.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.667
Shihab-Eldin: <i>Flint
eventually switched back</i>

07:49.769 --> 07:51.536
<i>to Detroit's water supply.</i>

07:51.638 --> 07:53.971
<i>But the damage to their
lead pipes is so bad</i>

07:54.073 --> 07:55.973
<i>that the people still
don't trust their water.</i>

07:56.075 --> 07:59.444
We suffer,
but we livin'. We here.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.746
We can't just pack up and leave.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.281
Why not? 'Cause we don't
have the money for it.

08:04.383 --> 08:07.251
This is what we got to go
through every day, all day,

08:07.353 --> 08:09.620
until this problem is fixed.

08:11.791 --> 08:12.957
I don't drink it.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.493
I barely want to wash
my dishes with it.

08:15.595 --> 08:19.664
I won't let my granddaughter
bathe in it or shower in it

08:19.766 --> 08:21.398
or brush her teeth in it

08:21.501 --> 08:25.202
because we don't know
the long-term effects of this.

08:25.304 --> 08:27.271
I was drinking this water up until,

08:27.373 --> 08:28.673
I would say, about a month ago.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.475
<i>And then when I kept seeing
on the news...</i>

08:30.577 --> 08:32.510
<i>I said, "Fuck that shit."
They was sayin' lead and shit.</i>

08:32.611 --> 08:34.544
But I was drinkin' it! You
don't trust the government?

08:34.647 --> 08:36.380
No... oh, no!
You can't trust 'em.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.683
<i>The only thing you can trust...
it's cold outside right now.</i>

08:38.784 --> 08:40.784
Brown: <i>You imagine
yourself waking up,</i>

08:40.886 --> 08:42.953
<i>not knowing for two whole years</i>

08:43.054 --> 08:45.089
<i>you're drinking poisonous water.</i>

08:45.191 --> 08:46.423
People are dying.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.026
Who want to be next?
Not me.

09:06.646 --> 09:09.213
Amen!

09:09.315 --> 09:11.682
The things that we're going through

09:11.784 --> 09:14.218
in 2016,

09:14.320 --> 09:16.521
in Flint, Michigan,
should be unheard of.

09:16.623 --> 09:20.525
In a country that has been so
rich and so vibrant as this,

09:20.627 --> 09:23.661
reality is what we're dealing with
is third-world-country stuff.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.867
We knew that the problem
was far bigger

09:29.969 --> 09:32.136
than they were letting it be known.

09:32.238 --> 09:36.206
But they continued to say that
it was fine, and it wasn't.

09:36.308 --> 09:39.476
And now, what's the situation today?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.780
It's toxic.
You can't drink it.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.448
You can't brush your teeth with it.

09:44.551 --> 09:47.518
Some people go to other areas
just to take baths.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.354
The lead is still in the pipes now,

09:50.456 --> 09:53.223
so there is nothing safe
about this water.

09:53.325 --> 09:55.159
So there are some people
who don't have a car

09:55.261 --> 09:58.796
and can't go get supplies, or who
are not receiving these supplies?

09:58.898 --> 09:59.898
That is correct.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.566
What do those people do?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.068
They drink the water.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.671
Shihab-Eldin: <i>The government's
response to the crisis</i>

10:06.773 --> 10:09.273
<i>has been so slow and so dysfunctional</i>

10:09.375 --> 10:12.242
<i>that local law enforcement
has taken it upon themselves</i>

10:12.344 --> 10:13.978
<i>to step in and help.</i>

10:14.080 --> 10:17.214
I don't trust
the government's testing.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.785
In the jail,
I'm giving them bottled water.

10:20.887 --> 10:24.254
The inmates have better than
the people that are out here.

10:24.356 --> 10:26.557
Isn't there something
wrong with that?

10:26.659 --> 10:28.158
Everybody's talking.
Mm-hmm.

10:28.260 --> 10:31.328
Everybody... all the politicians...
everybody's talking.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.898
Somebody had to get
off their ass and do it.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.499
And I thought, "I have a jail.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.435
"I've got
the community-service workers.

10:38.537 --> 10:41.472
I've got deputies.
I can do this."

10:41.574 --> 10:43.808
Shihab-Eldin: <i>Sheriff Robert
Pickell has worked in Flint</i>

10:43.910 --> 10:45.576
<i>for 18 years</i>

10:45.678 --> 10:48.212
<i>and he's seen how this
once-thriving industrial city</i>

10:48.314 --> 10:51.782
<i>became one of the most
impoverished in the nation.</i>

10:51.884 --> 10:53.618
General Motors pulled out

10:53.720 --> 10:57.454
and we're unable to get
the industry to come in.

10:57.556 --> 11:00.024
But you really have to have industry,

11:00.126 --> 11:03.728
you know, if you're going
to be a vibrant city.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.797
If this was Grosse Pointe
or Ann Arbor,

11:06.899 --> 11:09.600
this never would have happened.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.003
Shihab-Eldin: <i>Authorities
have been replacing</i>

11:12.105 --> 11:14.404
<i>the lead-service lines
in Flint for months now.</i>

11:14.507 --> 11:18.242
<i>But so far, they've completed
less than 1% of the work.</i>

11:18.344 --> 11:21.979
<i>and many homes continue to test
positive for elevated levels of lead.</i>

11:22.081 --> 11:24.248
So we're at a community
family fun night,

11:24.350 --> 11:27.184
where families are bringing
their kids in order to play,

11:27.286 --> 11:30.187
but also to be tested
for lead poisoning.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.160
You ready?
It's all right, sweetie.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.929
That's all.
Good job!

11:39.032 --> 11:41.465
What a big boy today!

11:41.567 --> 11:43.600
Almost there.
No, no.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.038
There's no more poke. We're just
going to collect the blood, honey.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.041
Okay? I know.
Little more.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.744
Shihab-Eldin: <i>Young children are
especially vulnerable to lead poisoning,</i>

11:53.846 --> 11:57.114
<i>which can cause developmental
delays, hearing loss,</i>

11:57.216 --> 11:58.582
<i>and even death.</i>

11:58.685 --> 12:01.152
Well, he has scars on his legs. Mine.

12:01.253 --> 12:05.022
Like that. And they're on both legs.
Mm-hmm.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.524
He was getting bumps all over.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.126
You took him to the doctor?

12:09.228 --> 12:10.527
Yeah, they said it was a virus.

12:10.629 --> 12:13.030
They said because
of the lead in his blood,

12:13.132 --> 12:14.631
he couldn't get rid of it.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.433
How does this affect children
in Flint?

12:16.535 --> 12:19.015
I mean, what are the repercussions
of having lead in the water?

12:19.072 --> 12:22.206
Lead destroys kids' potentials.

12:22.308 --> 12:25.542
<i>It creates anti-social behavior.
It reduces IQ.</i>

12:25.644 --> 12:28.079
Brain damage? Oh, yeah.
No, absolutely.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.714
They knew a long time ago

12:29.816 --> 12:31.682
that they were
poisoning people from it.

12:31.784 --> 12:35.419
They could care less.

12:35.521 --> 12:38.122
Shihab-Eldin: <i>The crisis in Flint
caused a nation-wide uproar</i>

12:38.224 --> 12:40.357
<i>so intense that in May,</i>

12:40.459 --> 12:42.159
<i>President Obama visited Flint</i>

12:42.261 --> 12:46.864
<i>and took a sip
of filtered local water.</i>

12:46.966 --> 12:50.835
And this used a filter.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.737
<i>But Congressman Dan Kildee,</i>

12:52.839 --> 12:54.338
<i>who was born and raised in Flint,</i>

12:54.440 --> 12:57.041
<i>says what happened there
is just a symptom</i>

12:57.143 --> 13:00.044
<i>of a larger crisis
spreading across America.</i>

13:00.146 --> 13:01.846
This is an important story

13:01.948 --> 13:06.016
because it rips the cover
off some of the falsehoods

13:06.119 --> 13:08.552
of the current promise
that America represents.

13:08.654 --> 13:12.857
This is happening in one way or
another all over the country.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.692
<i>You look at older cities</i>

13:15.795 --> 13:17.628
<i>that are mostly poor,</i>

13:17.730 --> 13:20.297
mostly African-American,
and you see a lot

13:20.399 --> 13:22.299
of the same things going on...

13:22.401 --> 13:24.969
crumbling schools, empty buildings,

13:25.071 --> 13:27.104
<i>no real investment.</i>

13:27.206 --> 13:29.273
We let these cities get to the point

13:29.375 --> 13:31.876
where they're
just one bad decision away

13:31.978 --> 13:33.710
from complete collapse.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.614
The folks making
these decisions don't care

13:37.716 --> 13:39.917
about people who live in Flint.

13:40.019 --> 13:43.020
Nobody in Flint wants sympathy.
We just want justice.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.992
Five years ago,
a violent revolution...

13:48.094 --> 13:51.128
<i>removed Libyan dictator
Muammar Gaddafi from power.</i>

13:51.230 --> 13:52.863
<i>But in the chaos that followed,</i>

13:52.965 --> 13:55.232
<i>an attack on US personnel in Benghazi</i>

13:55.334 --> 13:56.667
<i>killed our ambassador there</i>

13:56.769 --> 13:58.368
<i>and several other employees,</i>

13:58.470 --> 14:01.438
<i>sparking an intense
partisan debate here at home.</i>

14:01.540 --> 14:04.041
We were misled that
there were supposedly protests

14:04.143 --> 14:05.663
and then something
sprang out of that...

14:05.711 --> 14:07.111
an assault sprang out of that...

14:07.213 --> 14:09.479
What difference
at this point does it make?

14:09.581 --> 14:12.149
It is our job
to figure out what happened

14:12.251 --> 14:16.453
and do everything we can to prevent it
from ever happening again, Senator.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.055
Lost in that argument, however,

14:18.157 --> 14:20.724
is what's happening
on the ground in Libya today,

14:20.827 --> 14:24.061
<i>where, in the power vacuum
Gaddafi left behind,</i>

14:24.163 --> 14:26.330
ISIS is beginning to step in

14:26.432 --> 14:28.065
and fill the void.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.145
Man: <i>This is the place
where time stopped</i>

14:41.247 --> 14:45.716
<i>for American in Libya. It's
the US Consulate in Benghazi.</i>

14:45.818 --> 14:49.286
In 2012, the US Ambassador
and three other Americans

14:49.388 --> 14:51.355
were killed in a Islamist attack

14:51.457 --> 14:53.324
by the group Ansar al-Sharia.

14:53.425 --> 14:56.393
<i>But since then, the debate
in America has focused on</i>

14:56.495 --> 14:59.196
<i>who is to blame for the events
that happened that day,</i>

14:59.298 --> 15:02.399
not what happened to Libya
in the years afterwards.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.135
And what's happened
is that Ansar al-Sharia

15:05.238 --> 15:07.137
and ISIS have teamed up

15:07.240 --> 15:09.406
to control much of the city
for years.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.142
<i>While ISIS grew in Syria and Iraq,</i>

15:12.245 --> 15:14.178
<i>they're now gaining strength
in a Libya</i>

15:14.280 --> 15:16.680
<i>which is controlled
by two dueling governments.</i>

15:16.782 --> 15:17.942
<i>They've already taken control</i>

15:18.017 --> 15:18.849
<i>of an entire city</i>

15:18.951 --> 15:21.051
<i>in the center
of the country... Sirte.</i>

15:21.153 --> 15:22.186
<i>And they've made advances</i>

15:22.288 --> 15:23.288
<i>all along the coast,</i>

15:23.322 --> 15:25.022
<i>including in Benghazi.</i>

15:26.993 --> 15:28.993
<i>For the past 18 months,</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:31.161
<i>the forces that are loyal
to the Eastern government</i>

15:31.264 --> 15:33.497
<i>have been fighting ISIS in Benghazi.</i>

15:33.599 --> 15:36.934
<i>We went to a neighborhood that
was liberated from ISIS fighters</i>

15:37.036 --> 15:38.535
<i>only days earlier.</i>

15:38.637 --> 15:40.570
How safe is this street?

15:45.044 --> 15:47.278
<i>Colonel Jamal al-Zahawi
is the commander</i>

15:47.380 --> 15:50.381
<i>of the Libyan army brigade
that controls this area.</i>

15:58.324 --> 16:03.160
So, this area here has just been freed
of ISIS... Islamic State fighters.

16:03.262 --> 16:06.263
But they've left a lot
of surprises behind,

16:06.365 --> 16:09.766
like this table here,
which is wired to an IED.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.902
You can see the wire go up the frame,

16:12.004 --> 16:15.172
so that when you open the door,
it explodes.

16:16.508 --> 16:20.544
All this stuff is still
very fresh and active.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.914
<i>Evidence of ISIS's presence
was everywhere.</i>

16:25.551 --> 16:27.151
Looks like it.
Yes?

16:27.253 --> 16:28.552
Yes.
You know?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.587
I know this one.
It's a famous brand.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.525
Ostrovsky: <i>While the
neighborhood has been reclaimed,</i>

16:35.627 --> 16:37.594
<i>it remains an active war zone.</i>

16:39.932 --> 16:41.865
<i>We watched as the colonel's troops</i>

16:41.968 --> 16:44.335
<i>attacked an ISIS-controlled
stronghold nearby.</i>

16:44.437 --> 16:47.604
They're moving an aircraft
missile into position.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.773
That's no airplane,
but they've fashioned it

16:49.875 --> 16:51.976
so that they can shoot it
off of the ground.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.878
I hope they know
how to make sure it explodes

16:54.981 --> 16:56.713
over there and not right here

16:56.815 --> 16:58.615
because that's a 200-lb bomb.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.758
This area has been cleared of ISIS,

17:08.861 --> 17:11.328
but about a mile that way,
they're still there,

17:11.430 --> 17:13.864
where that rocket is about to land.

17:21.140 --> 17:24.708
Ostrovsky: <i>The US government
recently raised the estimated number</i>

17:24.810 --> 17:27.611
<i>of ISIS fighters in Libya
to as many as 6,000,</i>

17:27.713 --> 17:29.980
<i>double the number
from a year earlier.</i>

17:30.082 --> 17:32.949
<i>Now discussions have started on
whether the US should support</i>

17:33.052 --> 17:35.552
<i>loosening a UN arms embargo on Libya</i>

17:35.654 --> 17:38.522
<i>and allow the arming
of the forces fighting ISIS.</i>

17:38.624 --> 17:41.625
<i>General Khalifa Haftar is
the head of the Libyan Army</i>

17:41.727 --> 17:44.594
<i>for the internationally-
recognized Eastern government.</i>

17:44.696 --> 17:47.731
<i>He told us what's at stake
if ISIS isn't defeated.</i>

18:25.003 --> 18:26.937
Ostrovsky:
<i>That's why it's so important</i>

18:27.039 --> 18:29.873
<i>for General Haftar
to defeat ISIS in Benghazi.</i>

18:29.975 --> 18:31.608
<i>On the outskirts of the city,</i>

18:31.710 --> 18:33.177
<i>we visited the frontlines</i>

18:33.279 --> 18:35.279
<i>with a group of his
special-forces soldiers</i>

18:35.381 --> 18:37.548
<i>as they encircled an ISIS stronghold.</i>

18:37.649 --> 18:38.949
So we can hear gunfire

18:39.051 --> 18:42.953
probably coming from the cement
factory, which we just passed.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.622
They're heading out on a patrol.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.591
The fighting here
is house-to-house.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.560
They've put these holes in the walls

18:49.661 --> 18:52.996
so that they don't have
to walk down the streets.

19:00.072 --> 19:03.273
<i>They use buildings like this,
just people's houses,</i>

19:03.375 --> 19:05.609
<i>as positions now
because this neighborhood</i>

19:05.711 --> 19:07.478
<i>has been turned into a frontline.</i>

19:10.749 --> 19:13.883
Wow, that's just a couple
hundred yards from here.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.885
Their position is down there.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.388
<i>ISIS is so close,
soldiers sit in windows</i>

19:18.491 --> 19:20.557
<i>to guard against a surprise attack.</i>

19:20.659 --> 19:23.093
I do not envy this man's job,
waiting for a bullet

19:23.195 --> 19:25.095
to come through this window.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.308
So right now, they're just trying

19:38.410 --> 19:40.611
to draw them out of their
holes with their fire.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.417
<i>We sat down with the commander</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:48.560
<i>of Haftar's special forces</i>

19:48.654 --> 19:51.488
<i>on the frontline,
Fadl Faraj al-Hassi.</i>

19:51.590 --> 19:53.823
Unfortunately, Americans
stopped paying attention

19:53.925 --> 19:55.492
to what's happening in Benghazi

19:55.594 --> 19:57.694
after the American ambassador
died here.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.830
He was killed by a group
called Ansar al-Sharia.

20:00.932 --> 20:02.666
Now there's ISIS here as well.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.608
What's the difference
between these two groups?

20:20.819 --> 20:23.587
No, no, no.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.923
What the fuck is that?

20:27.025 --> 20:28.692
Why, why, why, why?

20:28.794 --> 20:30.561
There's shooting.
No.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.196
Who's shooting?

20:39.705 --> 20:41.705
There's obviously
still fighting going on here.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.808
We just heard a couple of shots.
Do you need America's help?

20:53.419 --> 20:57.487
So apparently, there's a sniper at the
top of the brown house over there.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.523
So we should stay close to the wall

20:59.625 --> 21:01.525
when we're moving through this area.

21:01.627 --> 21:04.595
<i>Our camera crew made it
safely across the field</i>

21:04.697 --> 21:06.230
<i>into cover behind this wall.</i>

21:06.332 --> 21:09.099
<i>But I was 100 yards behind
when an ISIS sniper</i>

21:09.201 --> 21:11.335
<i>in a nearby house opened fire on us.</i>

21:13.439 --> 21:15.372
Were they shooting out or in?

21:15.474 --> 21:17.474
They were shooting out or in?

21:33.425 --> 21:35.191
Thank you.

21:36.495 --> 21:37.994
Oh, fuck.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.302
Ostrovsky: They're taking
us to another position.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.638
This time, it's one of their
artillery-firing positions.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.806
<i>The soldiers took us even closer</i>

21:49.908 --> 21:52.175
<i>to the ISIS-held cement
factory we'd passed earlier.</i>

21:52.278 --> 21:55.512
<i>They said it was too
dangerous without an escort.</i>

21:55.614 --> 21:57.814
<i>So this is what they sent...</i>

21:57.916 --> 22:00.216
<i>a Russian-made tank.</i>

22:05.658 --> 22:08.292
<i>In the previous week, General
Haftar had driven ISIS fighters</i>

22:08.394 --> 22:11.060
<i>back from much
of the city, except here.</i>

22:11.163 --> 22:14.097
<i>Now his fighters needed heavy
artillery like this...</i>

22:15.267 --> 22:17.668
<i>to soften up fortified ISIS defenses.</i>

22:19.305 --> 22:21.672
So what's your objective
from this position?

22:42.060 --> 22:44.328
This isn't
any anti-terrorist operation.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.797
This right here is full-on war.

22:46.898 --> 22:49.065
Ostrovsky: <i>While these
forces seem to be</i>

22:49.167 --> 22:50.867
<i>winning the battle here for now,</i>

22:50.969 --> 22:52.669
<i>in another part of the country,</i>

22:52.771 --> 22:54.805
<i>ISIS has been
on the offensive...</i>

22:54.906 --> 22:57.474
<i>like at a checkpoint near
the small town of Abu Grain</i>

22:57.576 --> 22:59.976
<i>outside the ISIS-controlled
city of Sirte,</i>

23:00.078 --> 23:02.612
<i>where soldiers from the
Islamist-leaning Western government</i>

23:02.715 --> 23:04.815
<i>are trying to keep ISIS contained.</i>

23:04.916 --> 23:07.217
<i>Just months before we visited here,</i>

23:07.319 --> 23:10.086
<i>ISIS fighters launched a bloody raid.</i>

23:10.188 --> 23:12.356
<i>Here, seen
on closed-circuit TV,</i>

23:12.458 --> 23:14.391
<i>the ISIS fighters arrive
in pick-up trucks,</i>

23:14.493 --> 23:18.027
<i>then fire at the checkpoint
soldiers in the distance.</i>

23:18.129 --> 23:22.532
<i>One of the ISIS militants brazenly
moves into the open without cover,</i>

23:22.634 --> 23:26.002
<i>then makes a "cutthroat"
gesture to his enemy.</i>

23:26.104 --> 23:29.105
<i>The ISIS fighter on the left is shot.</i>

23:29.207 --> 23:34.043
<i>Before retreating, ISIS soldiers
stick around long enough</i>

23:34.145 --> 23:36.513
<i>to kill three guards.</i>

23:38.316 --> 23:40.149
<i>Observers like attorney David Tafuri</i>

23:40.252 --> 23:42.218
<i>see attacks like these
and worry that ISIS</i>

23:42.320 --> 23:45.088
<i>is slowly winning the battle
for control of Libya.</i>

23:45.190 --> 23:47.190
<i>During the revolution,
Tafuri flew to Benghazi</i>

23:47.292 --> 23:50.293
<i>to help the rebel government
free up $1.5 billion</i>

23:50.396 --> 23:52.095
<i>in frozen Gaddafi assets.</i>

23:52.197 --> 23:54.664
<i>Since then, he's worked
alongside Libyan officials</i>

23:54.767 --> 23:57.901
<i>to foster good governments
within this fractured country.</i>

23:58.003 --> 24:02.071
Libya is on the brink
of falling into chaos.

24:02.173 --> 24:04.408
And if something is not done soon,

24:04.510 --> 24:06.910
it will become a failed state.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.780
One of the biggest threats
to the United States

24:09.882 --> 24:12.849
is having more failed states
around the world.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.184
If ISIS takes control
of a place like Libya,

24:15.287 --> 24:17.521
it will become much more
powerful than it already is.

24:17.623 --> 24:21.257
It will have access to all of the
oil resources that Libya has.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.960
It will have a foothold
in North Africa,

24:24.062 --> 24:26.763
and ultimately, it will strike
against the United States

24:26.865 --> 24:28.899
and other Western countries.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.334
Ostrovsky: <i>While we were
in Libya, we saw evidence</i>

24:31.437 --> 24:33.537
<i>that the United States
was at least willing</i>

24:33.639 --> 24:35.872
<i>to intervene in Libya
on a limited basis.</i>

24:35.974 --> 24:38.274
Overnight, we conducted
an air strike in Libya

24:38.376 --> 24:40.777
targeting an ISIL training
camp near Sabratha.

24:40.879 --> 24:43.146
<i>The ISIL fighters at these facilities</i>

24:43.248 --> 24:45.181
<i>were planning external attacks on US</i>

24:45.283 --> 24:47.551
<i>and other Western interests
in the region.</i>

24:47.653 --> 24:49.486
Ostrovsky: <i>On the day
of the American attack,</i>

24:49.588 --> 24:51.154
<i>we set off
for the site of the bombing.</i>

24:51.256 --> 24:53.623
<i>The city of Sabratha
is all the way over</i>

24:53.725 --> 24:55.625
<i>on the western edge of the country</i>

24:55.727 --> 24:58.829
<i>and just 50 miles away from Tripoli.</i>

24:58.931 --> 25:02.065
<i>When we arrived, we were told
as many as 200 ISIS fighters</i>

25:02.167 --> 25:03.900
<i>were still hiding in the city.</i>

25:04.002 --> 25:06.937
<i>It was hard to tell
the good guys from the bad.</i>

25:07.038 --> 25:08.472
Ostrovsky:
As soon as we got here,

25:08.574 --> 25:10.474
we got an escort
from the local militia

25:10.576 --> 25:12.876
which is a local
Islamist militia as well,

25:12.978 --> 25:16.346
who up until now claimed
that there was no ISIS here.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.214
But they said
that they're going to take us

25:18.316 --> 25:19.816
to the site of the air strike now.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.518
And we have to trust them

25:21.620 --> 25:23.252
because we don't really
have any other choice.

25:29.327 --> 25:31.828
Ostrovsky: <i>At the bomb site,
we discovered the power</i>

25:31.930 --> 25:34.197
<i>of a US air strike.</i>

25:34.299 --> 25:35.999
This place is completely annihilated.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.534
This is what the sharp end

25:37.636 --> 25:41.404
of the US war on ISIS
in Libya looks like.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.945
So here is some of the ammo
that was here

25:49.047 --> 25:52.315
when the air strike took place.

25:53.652 --> 25:55.519
That's a big knife.

25:55.621 --> 25:59.155
They're saying that's for
cutting people's heads off.

25:59.257 --> 26:02.158
So this looks like
the Islamic State whiteboard

26:02.260 --> 26:05.729
because it says the Islamic
State Caliphate own it,

26:05.831 --> 26:10.767
and obviously,
the Islamic State black flag.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.869
<i>While we were at the site,</i>

26:12.971 --> 26:15.138
<i>we heard that two Serbian
diplomatic personnel,</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:17.473
<i>Sladjana Stankovic and Jovica Stepic,</i>

26:17.576 --> 26:18.942
<i>were among the dead.</i>

26:22.347 --> 26:25.916
Oh my God, there's some
of that woman's hair in here.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.419
That's her watch and jewelry.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.755
<i>The militia commander
said he removed her hair</i>

26:31.857 --> 26:36.059
<i>and other items on the day of the
bombings to help identify her.</i>

26:36.161 --> 26:38.428
<i>The United States
and Serbian governments</i>

26:38.530 --> 26:41.230
<i>agreed in March to fully
investigate the circumstances</i>

26:41.332 --> 26:44.100
<i>surrounding the deaths
of the diplomats.</i>

26:44.202 --> 26:46.703
<i>The target of the US strike
was a Tunisian</i>

26:46.805 --> 26:48.705
<i>named Noureddine Chouchane,</i>

26:48.807 --> 26:49.673
<i>the alleged mastermind</i>

26:49.775 --> 26:51.240
<i>behind two attacks inside Tunisia</i>

26:51.342 --> 26:54.343
<i>that claimed the lives of 60 people.</i>

26:54.446 --> 26:57.180
<i>It remains unclear whether
Chouchane died in the attack.</i>

26:57.282 --> 27:01.952
<i>But the American strike dealt
a blow to ISIS in the region.</i>

27:02.054 --> 27:04.253
This is the city morgue.
This is where they brought

27:04.355 --> 27:06.790
a lot of the bodies
from the air strike.

27:06.892 --> 27:11.995
Bloody mattresses,
blood all over the floors.

27:15.100 --> 27:19.869
Wow, there's just a pile
of body bags in here.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.605
It smells awful.

27:21.707 --> 27:23.773
Ostrovsky:
<i>More than 40 ISIS militants</i>

27:23.875 --> 27:26.342
<i>were believed to have
been killed in the attack.</i>

27:26.444 --> 27:29.746
<i>A few days after
our trip to the bomb site,</i>

27:29.848 --> 27:32.115
<i>ISIS reminded the residents
of Sabratha</i>

27:32.217 --> 27:35.719
<i>it hadn't gone away by killing four
members of the same security team</i>

27:35.821 --> 27:38.822
<i>that had protected us on our visit.</i>

27:38.924 --> 27:41.157
<i>While the American air strike
showed how effective</i>

27:41.259 --> 27:44.828
<i>US air power can be in the
global fight against ISIS,</i>

27:44.930 --> 27:47.230
<i>it was only the third
such strike inside Libya</i>

27:47.332 --> 27:48.832
<i>in the last five years.</i>

27:48.934 --> 27:51.668
The West and the US
are very reluctant

27:51.770 --> 27:55.138
to intervene in any country
because of the bad experiences

27:55.240 --> 27:58.108
that we've had in Iraq
and in Afghanistan.

27:58.209 --> 28:02.112
But at the same time, we're caught
in this very difficult situation

28:02.213 --> 28:05.381
where if we don't intervene,
groups like ISIS

28:05.483 --> 28:07.383
will take control and take power

28:07.485 --> 28:11.021
and ultimately engage
in terrorist attacks

28:11.123 --> 28:13.456
against the West that will require us

28:13.558 --> 28:15.391
to come back and fight them.

28:15.493 --> 28:17.927
Ostrovsky: <i>Late last
year, the United States</i>

28:18.030 --> 28:20.764
<i>reportedly sent special
operations teams to Libya</i>

28:20.866 --> 28:22.999
<i>to coordinate the fight against ISIS.</i>

28:23.101 --> 28:24.934
<i>But General Haftar
says more can be done</i>

28:25.037 --> 28:27.103
<i>to roll back
ISIS gains in Libya...</i>

28:27.205 --> 28:29.939
<i>a strategic country whose
location along the Mediterranean</i>

28:30.042 --> 28:32.168
<i>is the gateway to Europe and beyond.</i>
