WEBVTT

00:12.267 --> 00:14.833
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...
YOU'RE SHOT?

00:14.867 --> 00:16.633
CRISTINA?
YOU'RE THROWING ME OUT?

00:16.667 --> 00:19.167
GOT NO CHOICE.
WHAT'S WITH THE SUITCASE?

00:19.200 --> 00:20.600
YES. MY ANSWER IS YES.

00:20.633 --> 00:23.133
AN HOUR AGO,
HE WAS PROPOSING.

00:23.167 --> 00:24.567
I THOUGHT I WAS A SURGEON,
BUT I AM NOT.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.667
I STOPPED TEACHING WHEN YOU
NEEDED A TEACHER THE MOST.

00:27.700 --> 00:29.400
OUR MARRIAGE IS OVER.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.100
(Meredith) THERE'S THIS THING
THAT ALLOWS

00:31.133 --> 00:32.567
FOR THE CONSIDERING OF OPTIONS.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.500
IN THE OLDEN DAYS,
THEY CALLED IT DATING.
YOU BOWING OUT?

00:34.533 --> 00:36.767
NO. YOU?

00:36.800 --> 00:38.300
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.267
(laughs)

00:40.300 --> 00:41.633
(Meredith)
SURGEONS USUALLY FANTASIZE

00:41.667 --> 00:44.333
ABOUT WILD
AND IMPROBABLE SURGERIES--

00:44.367 --> 00:46.633
SOMEONE COLLAPSES
IN A RESTAURANT,

00:46.667 --> 00:48.733
WE SLICE THEM OPEN
WITH A BUTTER KNIFE,

00:48.767 --> 00:52.333
REPLACE A VALVE WITH
A HOLLOWED-OUT STICK OF CARROT.

00:53.833 --> 00:55.500
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN,

00:55.533 --> 00:58.500
SOME OTHER KIND OF FANTASY
SLIPS IN.

00:58.533 --> 01:01.300
***

01:01.333 --> 01:02.800
GOOD MORNING.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.767
GOOD MORNING.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.500
GOOD MORNING.

01:12.533 --> 01:15.100
IT IS A GOOD MORNING.

01:15.133 --> 01:16.067
HI.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.833
HI.

01:17.867 --> 01:21.533
***

01:21.567 --> 01:24.433
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP
LAST NIGHT?

01:24.467 --> 01:26.433
NOT REALLY.

01:26.467 --> 01:28.700
YOU WANT TO GET SOME NOW?

01:28.733 --> 01:31.233
NOT REALLY.

01:31.267 --> 01:34.133
***

01:38.133 --> 01:39.067
(banging)

01:39.100 --> 01:40.533
(George) OW.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.533
MOST OF OUR FANTASIES
DISSOLVE WHEN WE WAKE,

01:43.567 --> 01:45.633
BANISHED TO THE BACK
OF OUR MIND.

01:45.667 --> 01:48.067
BUT SOMETIMES, WE'RE SURE...

01:48.067 --> 01:48.833
(sighs)

01:48.867 --> 01:51.567
IF WE TRY HARD ENOUGH...

01:51.600 --> 01:54.067
WE CAN LIVE THE DREAM.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.267
***

01:56.300 --> 01:57.233
(banging)

01:57.267 --> 01:59.167
(George) DAMN IT! STUPID--OW!

01:59.200 --> 02:01.700
I WAS HAVING
A REALLY GOOD DREAM,

02:01.733 --> 02:03.667
AND YOU RUINED IT.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.633
SORRY. IT'S, UH, THE, UH,
THESE BOXES.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.467
ALL THESE BOXES.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.067
CALLIE SAID SHE WAS BRINGING
HER STUFF OVER,

02:10.067 --> 02:11.400
AND, UH... IT'S ALL HERE.

02:11.433 --> 02:13.267
IT'S OKAY, GEORGE.
I DON'T MIND.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.200
I DON'T MIND EITHER. NO.
DON'T MIND A BIT.

02:15.233 --> 02:17.233
KICK HER OUT.
WHAT? I CAN'T KICK HER OUT.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.800
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO TOLD HER
SHE COULD MOVE IN.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.733
I SAID SHE COULD STAY
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS--

02:20.767 --> 02:22.767
A COUPLE OF DAYS.
IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.733
NOW THERE ARE BOXES,
AND SHE'S USING MY COMPUTER.

02:24.767 --> 02:26.500
AND SHE'S HERE ALL THE TIME.

02:26.533 --> 02:28.667
WOULD YOU KICK HER OUT?
AND KICK HER OUT NOW.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.433
HEY, YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT
TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.633
THERE'S NO MORE HOT WATER.
(whispers) DO IT.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.267
WHY DO YOU HATE ME?
JUST DO IT.
HEY.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.667
CAN I GET A RIDE WITH
YOU GUYS TO THE HOSPITAL?
YOU'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL?

02:37.700 --> 02:40.233
YEAH, I'M--I'M GONNA GO IN,
TALK TO THE CHIEF,

02:40.267 --> 02:42.733
SEE ABOUT COMING BACK.

02:42.767 --> 02:45.633
ANYWAY, JUST LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.167
(door closes)

02:47.200 --> 02:49.267
THAT'S GREAT.
IZZIE IS COMING BACK.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.567
THAT'S... GREAT, RIGHT?

02:50.600 --> 02:51.533
MM-HMM.

02:51.567 --> 02:53.400
THAT'S MY TOWEL.

02:53.433 --> 02:54.633
OH.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.300
SORRY.

03:03.867 --> 03:06.067
(door closes)

03:06.067 --> 03:08.667
BOY, HE IS REALLY MOODY
IN THE MORNINGS.
YEAH.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.300
HE'S, UH... YEAH.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.067
YEAH.

03:15.767 --> 03:17.533
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE TODAY.

03:17.567 --> 03:19.100
I COULD CHANGE MY FLIGHT.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.433
BECAUSE I'M... SOBER NOW,

03:22.467 --> 03:24.367
AND, UH,
THERE'S WORK TO GET TO

03:24.400 --> 03:27.833
AND--AND PLANES TO BE CAUGHT
AND REAL LIVES TO BE LED.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.367
THANK YOU, TRULY, MARK,

03:29.400 --> 03:31.367
FOR ALL OF THE...

03:31.400 --> 03:32.600
SEX.

03:32.633 --> 03:34.567
I-I REALLY, I FEEL
MUCH BETTER NOW. I DO.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.067
AND I'M--I'M--
WELL, NOW I HAVE TO GO,

03:37.100 --> 03:38.433
AND SO DO YOU.

03:38.467 --> 03:41.400
SO, UH, DO YOU, UH,
WANT ME TO CALL YOU...

03:41.433 --> 03:42.800
A CAB TO THE AIRPORT?

03:42.833 --> 03:45.400
OH!

03:55.133 --> 03:57.067
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
YOUR BAD HAND?

03:57.067 --> 03:58.633
THAT'S WHAT
THE BALL'S FOR, RIGHT,

03:58.667 --> 04:01.067
FIXING YOUR BAD HAND?

04:04.300 --> 04:05.600
WORKS.

04:05.633 --> 04:08.767
THERE'S COFFEE ON THE FLOOR.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.500
FINE. I'LL--YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.467
WHATEVER. LEAVE IT.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.767
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

04:24.433 --> 04:25.767
SO I WAS THINKING,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.700
SINCE YOUR SHIFT ENDS
AFTER MINE,

04:27.733 --> 04:29.633
AND I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO WAIT AROUND,

04:29.667 --> 04:31.567
MAYBE I SHOULD GET
A COPY OF THE HOUSE KEY.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.500
NO. I LIKE LEAVING TOGETHER.
YOU DON'T NEED A KEY.

04:40.867 --> 04:42.367
IZZIE?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.500
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS IN THERE.

04:44.533 --> 04:46.067
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.100
BAILEY IS ON YOUR SIDE.

04:48.133 --> 04:51.267
AND THE CHIEF IS... HE IS
GONNA PUT ON HIS ANGRY FACE,

04:51.300 --> 04:53.267
BUT HE'S ON YOUR SIDE, TOO.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.600
EVERYBODY WANTS YOU BACK
IN THAT BUILDING.

04:54.633 --> 04:56.133
I KNOW. I KNOW.

04:56.167 --> 04:58.067
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE FINE.

04:58.100 --> 05:01.133
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A MINUTE,
PRACTICE MY SPEECH.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.633
OKAY.

05:08.533 --> 05:10.400
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO CONVINCE HER TO COME IN.

05:10.433 --> 05:12.067
BUT I DID.
I DID CONVINCE HER.

05:12.067 --> 05:13.800
THERE IS A WHOLE SERIES
OF DISCIPLINARY

05:13.833 --> 05:15.733
AND REHABILITATIVE STEPS
THAT IZZIE STEVENS

05:15.767 --> 05:17.633
WILL HAVE TO TAKE
BEFORE WE CAN--

05:17.667 --> 05:19.567
YOU CAN EXPLAIN THEM TO HER.
I NEVER AGREED TO THAT.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.567
SHE DIDN'T COMMIT A CRIME.
SHE'S AN INTERN--

05:21.600 --> 05:23.067
MY INTERN.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.233
YOU--YOU WANT TO
BLAME SOMEONE, BLAME ME.

05:25.267 --> 05:27.167
LOOK, BUT THAT GIRL
IS COMING IN HERE TODAY,

05:27.200 --> 05:30.067
AND--AND--AND YOU
ARE GOING TO TALK TO HER.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.567
AND YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER ALL
THE OTHER SURGEONS YOU'VE KNOWN

05:32.600 --> 05:34.500
WHO'VE EVER HAD
A LAPSE IN JUDGMENT

05:34.533 --> 05:35.800
THAT LED TO SOMEONE DYING

05:35.833 --> 05:38.367
OR SOMEONE'S ARM
FALLING OFF.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.733
MOST IMPORTANTLY,

05:39.767 --> 05:42.233
YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER
ALL THE MISTAKES THAT YOU MADE

05:42.267 --> 05:44.167
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
AND STUPID.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.800
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE FILLED
WITH PATIENCE AND COMPASSION.

05:46.833 --> 05:48.433
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO?

05:48.467 --> 05:50.167
YES!

05:52.600 --> 05:54.167
BECAUSE I'M THE BOSS.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.733
I'M...

05:57.367 --> 05:58.200
(sighs)

05:58.233 --> 06:00.633
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN
ANY DISRESPECT, SIR.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.267
I APOLOGIZE.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.700
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
TO YOU PERSONALLY.

06:04.733 --> 06:07.300
VERY PERSONALLY, SIR, YES.

06:09.567 --> 06:12.100
BEING THE BOSS
ISN'T AS GRATIFYING

06:12.133 --> 06:13.600
AS IT USED TO BE.

06:13.633 --> 06:15.733
NO, SIR.

06:15.767 --> 06:18.100
GET OUTTA HERE.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.067
I'M ON MY KNEES
IN A PUDDLE OF COFFEE,

06:20.067 --> 06:21.800
AND HE'S LYING ON THE COUCH
PLAYING WITH HIMSELF.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.700
YOU KNOW,
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

06:23.733 --> 06:25.233
BUT HE'S RECOVERING
FROM SURGERY,

06:25.267 --> 06:26.600
AND YOU'VE READ THE STUDIES

06:26.633 --> 06:28.533
ON RECOVERY AND DEPRESSION
IN SURGICAL PATIENTS.

06:28.567 --> 06:30.467
WELL, HE'S NOT A PATIENT.
HE'S PRESTON BURKE.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.833
HE'S JUST MILKING IT.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.767
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT ME
FETCHING HIS FOOD

06:33.800 --> 06:35.700
AND THE PAPER AND HIS SLIPPERS
LIKE I'M A DOG.

06:35.733 --> 06:37.533
HEY.
HI.

06:37.567 --> 06:40.233
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT YOU
LAST NIGHT.
YOU DID?

06:40.267 --> 06:42.433
MM-HMM.
WHAT WAS I DOING,
BRINGING YOU COFFEE?

06:42.467 --> 06:43.833
YOU WERE DEFINITELY NOT
BRINGING ME COFFEE.

06:43.867 --> 06:45.833
BUT COFFEE'S GOOD.

06:45.867 --> 06:47.367
I'M TOLD DATING STARTS

06:47.400 --> 06:49.600
WITH A CASUAL INVITATION
OVER A CUP OF COFFEE.
DOES IT?

06:49.633 --> 06:51.333
SO, MEREDITH,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT

06:51.367 --> 06:53.067
TO DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT?
HOW WAS THAT?

06:53.100 --> 06:54.433
WAS THAT CASUAL ENOUGH?
THAT WAS GOOD, RIGHT?
MM.

06:54.467 --> 06:56.333
NO? MM.
SO WE'RE DATING.

06:56.367 --> 06:59.567
WE'RE DATING.
PICK YOU UP AT 8:00.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.167
(elevator bell dings)

07:03.600 --> 07:05.433
HEY.
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.800
ACTUALLY, I WASN'T.

07:06.833 --> 07:08.667
BUT I DECIDED
YOU WERE WORTH A DETOUR.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.667
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT YOU
LAST NIGHT.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.500
WAS IT A GOOD DREAM?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.200
IT WAS.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.767
AND WHAT WAS I DOING?
YES, MER,
WHAT WAS HE DOING?

07:16.800 --> 07:17.900
WHAT'S THAT?

07:17.933 --> 07:18.967
IT'S FOR YOU. IT'S COFFEE CAKE--
BEST IN THE NORTHWEST.

07:19.067 --> 07:22.567
FIGURE I BETTER SOFTEN YOU UP
SO THAT WHEN I ASK YOU

07:22.600 --> 07:24.200
TO DINNER TONIGHT,
YOU HAVE TO SAY YES.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.100
UH, DINNER TONIGHT?
HOW ABOUT THAT?

07:26.133 --> 07:28.067
ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT,
MEREDITH?

07:28.067 --> 07:29.833
ACTUALLY, UH,
I'M NOT FREE TONIGHT.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.733
WELL, HOW ABOUT LUNCH?
I COULD COME HERE.

07:31.767 --> 07:34.167
YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING
TO EAT HOSPITAL FOOD?

07:34.200 --> 07:36.467
I LOVE CRAPPY FOOD.
1:00?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.233
I'LL BE HERE.
OKAY.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.400
YOU HAD A DREAM
ABOUT THE BOTH OF THEM?

07:42.433 --> 07:44.400
A THREESOME?

07:44.433 --> 07:45.767
NICE.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.167
JUST WHEN I THINK
YOU'RE BORING, YOU RISE.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.533
I'M DATING.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.300
AND... IT COMES WITH SNACKS.

07:54.833 --> 07:57.700
HEY, IZ.
HEY. I'M GOING IN
TO SEE THE CHIEF.

07:57.733 --> 08:01.133
EXCELLENT. BACK IN THE GAME,
STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE.

08:01.167 --> 08:03.333
LOOK, I'M--I'M RUNNING LATE.
UM, I'LL CATCH YOU LATER?

08:03.367 --> 08:04.733
YEAH, LATER.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.067
IZZIE'S BACK. THAT'S GOOD.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.100
OOH, COFFEE CAKE.

08:09.133 --> 08:12.067
I'M DATING.
TOUCH THAT PIECE,
LOSE A HAND.

08:12.067 --> 08:15.067
MORNING, PEOPLE.
GREY, WE'RE CLEARING THE DECKS.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.300
I NEED YOU WRITING
DISCHARGE FORMS.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.500
YANG, YOU'RE WITH DR. SHEPHERD.
KAREV, AS USUAL, YOU'RE WITH

08:19.533 --> 08:21.233
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD
IN O.B.-G.Y.N.

08:21.267 --> 08:25.533
O'MALLEY, DR. TORRES HAS
REQUESTED YOU TODAY IN ORTHO.

08:25.567 --> 08:27.067
WAS SHE SMILING?

08:27.067 --> 08:28.400
IZZIE'S BACK.

08:28.433 --> 08:31.333
"DR. TORRES
HAS REQUESTED YOU."

08:31.367 --> 08:33.267
JUST TELL HER, GEORGE.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.600
TELL HER YOU'RE NOT READY
TO MOVE IN TOGETHER.

08:35.633 --> 08:37.133
AND THEN TRY DATING.

08:37.167 --> 08:38.700
DATING IS FUN.

08:38.733 --> 08:40.267
KAREV, WE READY?

08:40.300 --> 08:42.367
ISN'T THIS GETTING OLD
FOR YOU?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.300
(cell phone rings)
NOPE. MAKES MY WHOLE DAY,
ACTUALLY.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.267
(ring)

08:45.300 --> 08:47.567
HELLO. HELLO.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.133
ARE YOU OKAY?

08:49.167 --> 08:50.667
NO. UH, YE--

08:50.700 --> 08:52.333
N-NO, I CAN'T.
I GOTTA--

08:52.367 --> 08:54.833
FIVE MINUTES.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.767
GO FIND SOMETHING
TO DO IN THE PIT.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.767
PERSONAL PROBLEM?
(bangs counter)

08:58.800 --> 09:00.500
GO.

09:03.633 --> 09:06.733
(exhales)

09:06.767 --> 09:10.067
FOURTH VISIT
IN THREE MONTHS.

09:12.467 --> 09:15.600
I'M DR. KAREV.
AND YOU ARE...

09:15.633 --> 09:18.100
MEGAN CLOVER. AND IT'S NOT
AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.500
SHE FELL ON THE PLAYGROUND,
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF BLOOD,

09:20.533 --> 09:22.333
AND IT LOOKED DEEP.
WE KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS.

09:22.367 --> 09:23.800
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

09:23.833 --> 09:26.200
WE KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS,
AND IT'S NOT THAT.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.133
SHE JUST... PLAYS ROUGH.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.567
YOU KNOW?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.233
THIS IS HER FILE,
ALL RIGHT?

09:31.267 --> 09:33.533
AND IT GOES BACK
SINCE WAY BEFORE WE GOT HER.

09:33.567 --> 09:36.233
BEFORE YOU GOT HER?
WE'RE HER FOSTER PARENTS.

09:36.267 --> 09:39.333
SHE'S SUCH A GREAT KID,
BUT SHE PLAYS REALLY--

09:39.367 --> 09:40.700
SHE PLAYS ROUGH.

09:40.733 --> 09:42.267
YEAH. YEAH.

09:43.533 --> 09:45.067
RIGHT. UH...

09:45.067 --> 09:47.367
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO UP
TO THE NURSES' STATION

09:47.400 --> 09:49.667
AND LET THEM MAKE A COPY
OF HER FILE FOR YOU?

09:49.700 --> 09:52.467
AND, UH, I'LL TAKE A LOOK
AT MEGAN'S LEG.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.233
OKAY. WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK, HONEY.

09:54.267 --> 09:55.567
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.433
(woman) OKAY.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.300
YOU GOT SOME MEAN LOOKING
BRUISES, YOU KNOW THAT?

10:03.333 --> 10:05.233
WHAT, DID YOU HURT
YOUR ARM, TOO?

10:05.267 --> 10:07.567
NOTHING BIG.
I FELL OFF MY BIKE.

10:09.167 --> 10:12.200
ARE THOSE STAPLES?
WHAT THE HELL?

10:12.233 --> 10:13.767
DID THEY DO THIS TO YOU?

10:13.800 --> 10:16.333
NO! NO!
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

10:16.367 --> 10:18.833
I DID. I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO TO THE DOCTOR AGAIN,

10:18.867 --> 10:20.467
SO I JUST STAPLED IT.
IT'S NO BIGGIE.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.367
YOU STAPLED YOUR OWN ARM?

10:22.400 --> 10:24.667
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST
STITCH UP MY LEG

10:24.700 --> 10:26.200
SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE?

10:26.233 --> 10:28.133
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITH THOSE PEOPLE, MEGAN.

10:28.167 --> 10:29.767
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA LAY
A HAND ON YOU AGAIN.
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.733
PLEASE. THEY'RE MY BEST PARENTS
I'VE EVER HAD.
MEGAN.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.633
THEY DON'T HURT ME.
I CAN'T BE HURT.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.233
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

10:35.267 --> 10:37.267
PUNCH ME IN THE STOMACH
RIGHT NOW.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.700
THE STAPLES ARE IN THERE
PRETTY DEEP.

10:38.733 --> 10:40.600
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GIVE YOU
A SHOT TO NUMB THE PAIN.

10:40.633 --> 10:43.033
I DON'T NEED A SHOT.
TRUST ME.
YOU WANT A SHOT.

10:43.067 --> 10:45.367
IT'S SWOLLEN. IT'S GONNA
HURT LIKE A...

10:51.067 --> 10:52.800
(spits)
THERE. CAN I GO NOW?

10:52.833 --> 10:54.733
THAT DIDN'T EVEN HURT?

11:00.333 --> 11:03.733
(whispers)
I HAVE SUPERPOWERS, OKAY?

11:15.067 --> 11:16.733
MR. TRESSELT'S HAVING
A CORPUS CALLOSOTOMY.

11:16.767 --> 11:18.400
WHAT'S THAT GONNA LOOK LIKE?

11:18.433 --> 11:20.300
WE'LL BE SEVERING
SOME OF THE FIBERS

11:20.333 --> 11:22.467
THAT CONNECT THE RIGHT AND LEFT
HEMISPHERE OF HIS BRAIN...
MM-HMM.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.400
TO PREVENT THE SPREAD
OF SEIZURE ACTIVITY

11:24.433 --> 11:27.067
FROM ONE HALF OF HIS BRAIN
TO THE OTHER.
GOOD. RIGHT.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.767
DADDY'S LETTING THEM
CHOP HIS BRAIN IN HALF

11:28.800 --> 11:32.633
BECAUSE DADDY'S A BIG DUMMY.
YES, HE IS.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.200
THEY'RE NOT CHOPPING
MY BRAIN IN HALF, LEANNE.
CHOP! RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

11:35.233 --> 11:38.667
TAYLOR SHOULD FUNCTION
MUCH LIKE HE DOES RIGHT NOW.

11:38.700 --> 11:41.067
REALLY?
I'M HAVING FIVE SEIZURES
A DAY, LEANNE.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.633
I KNOW THAT.
YOU DON'T LEAVE ME
IN A ROOM ALONE WITH THE BABY.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.467
YOU THINK I DON'T NOTICE?
YOU ASK YOUR MOTHER TO COME BY

11:45.500 --> 11:47.633
EVERY TIME YOU NEED
TO TAKE A SHOWER.
THAT'S NOT THE REASON.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.533
IT'S BECAUSE YOU THINK
I'M A DANGER TO THE BABY.

11:49.567 --> 11:52.167
AND I AM.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.333
LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT SURE,
FOR ANY REASON,

11:56.367 --> 11:57.733
WE CAN WAIT.

11:57.767 --> 12:00.700
I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR BABY.

12:00.733 --> 12:03.267
PLEASE, LEANNE,
WE ALREADY AGREED.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.300
PLEASE.

12:12.067 --> 12:13.767
I GOT THIS KID IN THE PIT.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.733
SHE'S PSYCHO
AND HER FOSTER PARENTS

12:15.767 --> 12:17.667
ARE BEATING THE CRAP
OUT OF HER.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.833
SHE TELL YOU THAT OR YOU
FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF?

12:19.867 --> 12:21.533
WELL, SHE'S COVERED
IN BRUISES.

12:21.567 --> 12:23.567
SHE'S GOT A 10-CENTIMETER LAC
ON HER ARM

12:23.600 --> 12:25.333
WITH THREE STAPLES IN IT,

12:25.367 --> 12:27.567
LIKE FROM A STAPLE GUN
IN YOUR GARAGE.
HER PARENTS DID THAT?

12:27.600 --> 12:29.233
WELL, SHE SAYS
SHE DID IT HERSELF.

12:29.267 --> 12:30.500
SHE'S GOT THIS WHOLE BIT
ABOUT BEING A SUPERHERO

12:30.533 --> 12:33.133
AND HOW SHE CAN TAKE
THE PAIN.
YOU CALL SOCIAL SERVICES?

12:33.167 --> 12:35.067
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY DOWN.
OKAY, WELL, HAVE THEM
SPEAK TO THE PARENTS

12:35.100 --> 12:37.700
WHILE YOU RUN A COLD PRESSURE
TEST ON THE GIRL.
A WHAT?

12:37.733 --> 12:39.667
ICE WATER.
TEST HER RESPONSE TO PAIN.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.300
AT THE VERY LEAST,
IT'LL KEEP HER DISTRACTED

12:41.333 --> 12:42.767
WHILE THE PARENTS
ARE QUESTIONED.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.467
YOU REQUESTED ME?

12:44.500 --> 12:46.167
YEAH, I DID.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.667
YOU WERE WEIRD
THIS MORNING.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.333
I WASN'T WEIRD...

12:49.367 --> 12:51.500
ANY MORE THAN I NORMALLY AM
IN THE MORNING.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.667
IT'S A WEIRD TIME OF DAY
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.333
IT'S BRIGHT... AND CROWDED
AT OUR HOUSE IN THE MORNING.

12:56.367 --> 12:58.233
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF PEOPLE
RUNNING AROUND.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.433
GOOD. WE HAVE
A RADICAL CASE TODAY.

13:00.467 --> 13:03.067
YOU'RE GONNA BE GLAD
YOU'RE WITH ME.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.333
THANKS.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.633
MR. JASPER HOBIE.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.167
DR. T.
HEY!

13:07.200 --> 13:08.533
YOU MISSED ME.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.067
MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.433
THIS IS DR. O'MALLEY.
HE'S GONNA BE HELPING OUT.
HI.

13:12.467 --> 13:14.633
HOW YOU DOIN'?
JUNE 12th, BABY.
MM-HMM.

13:14.667 --> 13:18.300
2.4-MILE SWIM,
112 MILES ON THE BIKE

13:18.333 --> 13:20.533
AND THEN A MARATHON.
MM. THAT IS ROCKIN'.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.133
AM I GONNA BE READY?
YOU BET YOUR SCULPTED ASS
YOU ARE.

13:23.167 --> 13:25.167
(laughs) I LOVE THIS WOMAN.

13:26.767 --> 13:28.667
(laughs)
YOU HAD THREE SURGERIES
LAST YEAR.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.433
YEAH, TWO ROTATOR CUFFS
AND AN A.C.L.

13:30.467 --> 13:31.667
ALL WITH DR. T.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.433
AND NOW YOU'RE HAVING
AN ANKLE REPLACEMENT?

13:33.467 --> 13:35.433
WE WAITED OVER A YEAR
FOR A MATCH.

13:35.467 --> 13:36.800
WE'RE GONNA REPLACE HIS ANKLE

13:36.833 --> 13:39.167
WITH AN ANKLE JOINT
FROM A CADAVER.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.133
WHO'S MY GUY?
YOUR DONOR?

13:41.167 --> 13:44.133
WELL, HE HASN'T
BEEN DEAD LONG, RIGHT?
UM, ABOUT A WEEK.

13:44.167 --> 13:46.333
AND HE'S DOWNSTAIRS.
NO WAY.
CAN I MEET HIM,

13:46.367 --> 13:48.400
PAY MY RESPECTS?
(Callie laughs)

13:48.433 --> 13:51.567
I DON'T THINK YOU TWO ARE
GONNA HAVE MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
DR. O'MALLEY'S
GONNA HANDLE YOUR LABS.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.400
(Callie laughs)

13:56.433 --> 13:57.733
HAVE YOU MET MY GUY?

14:00.467 --> 14:03.167
HEY, SUPERKID.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.100
WHERE ARE MY PARENTS?

14:05.133 --> 14:07.500
THEY'RE TALKING
TO SOME GROWN-UPS.

14:07.533 --> 14:09.067
I'M NOT A MORON.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.400
THEY'RE TALKING
TO A SOCIAL WORKER.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.800
MEGAN...

14:12.833 --> 14:15.067
THESE BRUISES,
THESE CUTS ALL OVER YOU,

14:15.100 --> 14:17.700
THIS ISN'T NORMAL.
I GET IN FIGHTS
A LOT, OKAY?

14:17.733 --> 14:20.367
BECAUSE I'M STRONGER THAN
SOME OF THE OTHER KIDS,

14:20.400 --> 14:22.267
SO I END UP
DEFENDING THE ONES

14:22.300 --> 14:23.900
WHO ARE WIMPY
OR SMALL OR WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE SCRAWNY, RIGHT?

14:23.933 --> 14:28.067
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
ONE OF THE BIG KIDS.
YEAH, BUT I CAN
TAKE THEM IN A FIGHT.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.067
ALL RIGHT.
PUT YOUR HANDS IN HERE.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.267
WHY?

14:31.300 --> 14:33.733
BECAUSE... WE'RE GONNA TEST
YOUR SUPERPOWERS.

14:33.767 --> 14:36.533
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? PUNCH ME
IN THE STOMACH RIGHT HERE.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.600
COME ON.
PUNCH ME IN THE STOMACH.

14:38.633 --> 14:40.800
LET'S JUST STICK TO THE WATER.
JUST PUT YOUR HAND IN HERE.

14:40.833 --> 14:44.333
AND I'LL--I'LL RACE YOU.
YOU CAN RACE ME. WHAT? COME ON.

14:44.367 --> 14:47.333
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF, UH,
YOU AFRAID OF A LITTLE ICE?

14:47.367 --> 14:49.267
YOU AFRAID
I'M GONNA BEAT YOU?

14:49.300 --> 14:51.367
COME ON. ON THE COUNT
OF THREE.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.067
ONE, TWO, THREE.

14:53.067 --> 14:56.067
PULL YOUR HAND OUT
WHEN IT STARTS TO HURT, PLEASE.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.333
WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?

15:00.800 --> 15:04.567
SUPERHEROES ARE ALL KIDS
WITH DEAD PARENTS, LIKE ME.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.433
AND THEY ALL FIGURED OUT
WHEN THEY WERE AROUND MY AGE

15:07.467 --> 15:10.200
THEY COULD DO THINGS THAT
NOBODY ELSE COULD, LIKE ME.

15:10.233 --> 15:13.100
***

15:16.133 --> 15:17.367
YOU MISSED YOUR PLANE?

15:17.400 --> 15:20.300
GROUNDED ON ACCOUNT
OF BAD WEATHER.
IT'S A CLOUDLESS SKY.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.567
THAT HAPPENS LIKE,
TWICE A YEAR IN SEATTLE.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.533
YEAH, BUT THERE'S
A TYPHOON IN NEW YORK.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.433
SIT DOWN.
HAVE A DRINK WITH ME.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.433
NO, I'M NOT HAVING A DRINK
WITH YOU. I AM WORKING.

15:29.467 --> 15:32.433
AT WORK, NOT HERE.
SO COFFEE, RIGHT?

15:32.467 --> 15:33.533
MARK--

15:33.567 --> 15:36.633
JOE, CAN WE GET
THE DOCTOR A COFFEE?

15:36.667 --> 15:39.533
AND THEY THINK IT'S WEIRD
THAT THEY CAN DO ALL THIS STUFF,

15:39.567 --> 15:42.300
BUT THEY DON'T TELL ANYBODY
BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD FREAK OUT

15:42.333 --> 15:44.067
LIKE YOU DID.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.600
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

15:45.633 --> 15:48.633
***

15:48.667 --> 15:50.667
SON OF A--OW!

15:50.700 --> 15:51.633
AH! AH!

15:51.667 --> 15:54.367
TAKE YOUR HAND OUTTA THERE
BEFORE IT FALLS OFF.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.300
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.300
YOU DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING?
NOTHING?

15:58.333 --> 16:00.300
NO. NOBODY EVER BELIEVES ME.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.833
LIKE YESTERDAY IN SCHOOL,

16:01.867 --> 16:03.500
THIS KID SAID I WAS
FULL OF IT.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.700
I HAD TO LET HIM PUNCH ME
IN THE STOMACH 25 TIMES

16:05.733 --> 16:07.067
BEFORE HE BELIEVED ME,

16:07.100 --> 16:09.633
AND ONCE
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.567
WHAT?

16:11.600 --> 16:12.767
WE'LL HAVE CARDIOLOGY
CHECK THIS,

16:12.800 --> 16:14.700
AND THEN YOU'LL BE
GOOD TO GO.

16:14.733 --> 16:16.633
ALL DONE. THERE'S MY GUY.

16:16.667 --> 16:21.367
JAKE... WE'RE ALMOST ALL DONE
WITH THIS WHOLE THING.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.133
(Leanne) WE'RE NOT ALMOST DONE.
YOU STILL HAVE BRAIN SURGERY

16:24.167 --> 16:26.467
AND GOD KNOWS HOW MANY WEEKS
OF RECOVERY AHEAD OF YOU.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.833
SHE'S RIGHT.

16:27.867 --> 16:30.300
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.667
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.100
YEAH. RECOVERY'S HELL
ON THE SPOUSE.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.067
IT'S GONNA BE HARDER
FOR YOU THAN ON HIM.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.800
MY MOM'S STAYING WITH US
FOR A WEEK.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.333
MAYBE SHE SHOULD STAY LONGER.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.733
YOU KNOW, IT'S--IT'S BRUTAL
BEING THE CARETAKER.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.133
YOU'LL BE FETCHING THE PAPER
AND THEN CLEANING THE CARPET...
HONEY.

16:44.167 --> 16:46.067
AND OH--OH, HE WANTS
ICE IN A CUP, NOT A MUG.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.800
IT'S LIKE--IT NEVER STOPS.

16:47.833 --> 16:50.733
IT'S THE CARETAKERS
THAT ARE THE SILENT VICTIMS.

16:50.767 --> 16:53.333
YOU KNOW, AND WHEN DO YOU
EVER HEAR ABOUT THEM?
HONEY, TAKE THE BABY.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.700
NEVER. I NEVER HEAR
ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.

16:55.733 --> 16:57.633
IT'S ALWAYS, YOU KNOW,
"THE PATIENT THIS,

16:57.667 --> 17:00.367
THE PATIENT THAT."
SILENT VICTIMS.
HONEY, TAKE THE BABY.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.367
OH!

17:01.400 --> 17:03.267
OH!
TAYLOR!

17:03.300 --> 17:05.433
CAN SOMEONE HELP HERE,
PLEASE?!

17:05.467 --> 17:07.700
TAYLOR, PLEASE.
ANNETTE, COME ON!

17:12.467 --> 17:14.533
(Cristina) HIS SEIZURE
LASTED ABOUT A MINUTE,

17:14.567 --> 17:17.300
AND HE WAS POST-ICTAL
FOR FIVE.
IS THE BABY OKAY?

17:17.333 --> 17:20.167
HE'S FINE.
IT SHOULDN'T INTERFERE
WITH HIS SURGERY,

17:20.200 --> 17:21.733
ASSUMING WE'RE STILL
GOING FORWARD.

17:21.767 --> 17:24.467
HONEY?

17:24.500 --> 17:27.767
YEAH. I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICE.
ALL RIGHT, LEANNE,

17:27.800 --> 17:29.600
I'M GONNA
DO EVERYTHING I CAN, OKAY?

17:29.633 --> 17:31.233
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A WALK IN THE PARK,

17:31.267 --> 17:33.633
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE CARE
OF HIM.
(Leanne) OKAY.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.067
HEY, IZZIE.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.400
YOU DONE WITH THE CHIEF?

17:38.433 --> 17:40.200
NOT YET.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.700
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:41.733 --> 17:43.733
I'M FINE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

17:43.767 --> 17:45.667
UH, SHE'S DATING
EVERYONE WITH A PULSE,

17:45.700 --> 17:48.533
AND, UH, I'M TRYING TO GET
BURKE OUT OF THE BELL JAR.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.467
CRAP. I'M LATE FOR FINN.
GOTTA GO.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.667
YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

17:51.700 --> 17:53.433
YEAH.

17:53.467 --> 17:55.367
(scoffs)
SHE'S PLAYING THE FIELD,

17:55.400 --> 17:57.100
AND I'VE GOT A WIFE.

17:57.133 --> 18:00.067
POINT TO THE JUSTICE.

18:00.067 --> 18:03.367
***

18:03.400 --> 18:05.100
UH... OKAY.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.167
HERE'S THE THING--

18:10.200 --> 18:13.667
WE'VE BOTH REALLY
ENJOYED EACH OTHER,

18:13.700 --> 18:16.200
B-BEFORE AND NOW AGAIN,

18:16.233 --> 18:19.467
AND--AND I THINK
THAT'S A HEALTHY RELEASE.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.400
I MEAN, I-I THINK
IT'S--IT'S HEALTHY,

18:21.433 --> 18:23.333
I MEAN,
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

18:23.367 --> 18:27.067
AND, UM--BUT I DO THINK
THAT JUST BECAUSE I MADE

18:27.100 --> 18:28.600
WHAT CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED

18:28.633 --> 18:31.700
A TRANSCONTINENTAL...
(lowers voice) BOOTY CALL...

18:31.733 --> 18:33.800
(normal voice) DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE SHOULD BE TRYING

18:33.833 --> 18:35.733
TO MAKE SOMETHING
OUT OF THIS.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.767
I MEAN, WE--WE--
STOP DOING THAT!

18:37.800 --> 18:41.600
WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK.

18:41.633 --> 18:43.333
WE'RE GOOD TOGETHER.
WE AREN'T.

18:43.367 --> 18:45.367
YOU HAVE TO GO HOME.
COME BACK WITH ME.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.067
YOU'RE INSANE.
I'M NOT GOING BACK--

18:47.067 --> 18:49.233
I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO NEW YORK.

18:49.267 --> 18:53.133
'CAUSE IT WAS JUST
ABOUT SEX?

18:53.167 --> 18:56.067
***

18:59.700 --> 19:01.067
OOH!

19:01.067 --> 19:02.633
OH.

19:04.667 --> 19:08.167
***

19:11.467 --> 19:14.367
OKAY. UH, WELL...

19:14.400 --> 19:15.800
GOOD-BYE.

19:15.833 --> 19:17.800
GOOD-BYE.

19:17.833 --> 19:20.733
***

19:27.200 --> 19:30.267
STEVENS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
IN MY OFFICE AT 9:30.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.367
DIDN'T SHOW.
DID YOU TWO CHANGE YOUR MINDS?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.267
NO, SHE SAID
SHE WAS COMING IN.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.300
I'M SURE
SHE'LL TRACK YOU DOWN.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.100
WE NEED TO RUN A C.T.
ON THIS KID'S ABDOMEN.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.067
THIS SUPERHERO STUFF'S
WAY OUT OF HAND.

19:43.067 --> 19:45.500
IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SHE THINKS
SHE'S A SUPERHERO.

19:45.533 --> 19:47.433
I BELIEVED IN SANTA CLAUS
TILL I WAS 11.

19:47.467 --> 19:48.533
REALLY?

19:48.567 --> 19:51.467
DID SANTA EVER HIT YOU IN
THE GUT WITH A BASEBALL BAT?

19:54.467 --> 19:56.267
HEY, LAB'S GOOD?

19:56.300 --> 19:57.467
YEAH, THEY'RE ALL CLEAR.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.433
(sighs)

19:58.467 --> 20:00.133
SO WHY DOES A GUY

20:00.167 --> 20:02.033
HAVE FOUR ORTHO SURGERIES
IN ONE YEAR?

20:02.067 --> 20:03.267
BECAUSE HE'S
A SERIOUS ATHLETE.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.767
HIS BODY TAKES A BEATING.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.133
MAYBE HIS BODY
CAN'T HANDLE IT.

20:06.167 --> 20:08.067
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
TRIATHLONS THE GUY'S DONE?

20:08.100 --> 20:09.833
RIGHT, HE'S 55. DO YOU THINK
AN ANKLE REPLACEMENT

20:09.867 --> 20:11.767
AND 26 MILES A DAY
IS STILL A GOOD IDEA?

20:11.800 --> 20:14.467
UM, WHAT, DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD FIT HIM FOR A WALKER?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.400
HE'S POUNDING THE CRAP
OUT OF HIS JOINTS,

20:16.433 --> 20:18.333
AND HE'S ASKING YOU
TO CLEAN IT UP.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.267
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY HIPS I REPLACE

20:20.300 --> 20:21.633
BECAUSE PEOPLE
CAN'T BE BOTHERED

20:21.667 --> 20:24.167
TO WALK AROUND THE BLOCK
ONCE A MONTH?

20:24.200 --> 20:25.667
SOMETIMES, WE CAN MAKE
DREAMS COME TRUE.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.567
IT'S NOT ALL THE OFTEN.
WHEN WE CAN, WE SHOULD.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.800
DON'T YOU THINK?
YEAH, YEAH.

20:28.833 --> 20:30.433
GEORGE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

20:30.467 --> 20:32.233
HEY, I WAS GONNA
GO HOME FOR LUNCH.

20:32.267 --> 20:34.200
YOU WANNA COME?

20:36.300 --> 20:38.400
CALLIE JUST CALLED
MY HOUSE "HOME."

20:38.433 --> 20:40.533
WHERE DOES SHE GET THAT?
SHH.

20:40.567 --> 20:42.267
IT IS NOT HER HOME.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MEREDITH AND FINN.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.767
50 DOWN ON WHETHER SHEPHERD
SHOWS UP TO CHALLENGE FINN

20:48.800 --> 20:50.433
TO A DUEL.

20:50.467 --> 20:52.633
OH, CAN I BE, UH,
WITH 5?

20:52.667 --> 20:54.433
THAT'S NOT A BET.
THAT'S MILK MONEY, DUDE.

20:54.467 --> 20:56.567
(Meredith laughs)
(Cristina) OH,
AND SHE'S LAUGHING

20:56.600 --> 20:59.133
BECAUSE HE MADE A JOKE
WHICH PROBABLY WASN'T FUNNY.

20:59.167 --> 21:00.467
(laughs) "OH, YOU FUNNY VET."

21:00.500 --> 21:02.400
(George) I LEFT THE REST
OF MY CASH AT HOME,

21:02.433 --> 21:04.400
WHICH I CAN CALL IT
BECAUSE I LIVE THERE.

21:04.433 --> 21:07.233
I'M NOT A VISITOR.
HEY, YOU'RE A LOSER.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.200
YOU LIKE COMIC BOOKS, RIGHT?

21:09.233 --> 21:10.400
NO. (mouths word)

21:10.433 --> 21:12.333
I GOT THIS KID, THIS PATIENT.
SHE THINKS SHE'S A SUPERHERO.

21:12.367 --> 21:14.533
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?
SUPERHERO?

21:14.567 --> 21:17.133
WELL, SUPERHEROES LOOK
LIKE ANYONE, LIKE YOU OR ME.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.500
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT SOMEONE

21:18.533 --> 21:20.333
THAT PEOPLE NECESSARILY
NOTICE AS EXTRAORDINARY,

21:20.367 --> 21:22.367
MAYBE IN THEIR DAILY LIFE,
THEY GET WALKED ON,

21:22.400 --> 21:24.700
BUT THEN THERE'S A MOMENT--
THEY GET HIT BY A COSMIC RAY

21:24.733 --> 21:26.767
OR BITTEN BY
A RADIOACTIVE SPIDER,

21:26.800 --> 21:28.233
AND THEN SUDDENLY,

21:28.267 --> 21:30.600
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN
INSIDE THEM ALL THIS TIME,

21:30.633 --> 21:31.800
LYING DORMANT,
COMES RAGING OUT--

21:31.833 --> 21:33.767
DUDE, FORGET I ASKED.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.633
OH, HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO. OKAY. AHEM.

21:36.667 --> 21:39.567
***

21:41.500 --> 21:44.533
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

21:44.567 --> 21:47.733
***

21:47.767 --> 21:50.833
(sighs)
TAKES IT LIKE A MAN...

21:50.867 --> 21:53.633
AND WALKS AWAY.

21:53.667 --> 21:56.667
THANK YOU. 43...
HE'S COMIN' BACK.

21:56.700 --> 21:58.767
OH, YEAH. OH, YES, HE IS.
MNH-MNH.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.500
GIVE ME MY MONEY, MARY JANE.
LET IT GO.

22:00.533 --> 22:04.100
OH, GOD.
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

22:04.133 --> 22:05.400
WHAT?
HI.

22:05.433 --> 22:07.700
YOU'RE HAVING LUNCH?

22:07.733 --> 22:09.167
IN FACT, WE ARE.
OH, IT LOOKS GOOD.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.700
YOU KNOW,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

22:10.733 --> 22:12.800
BUT I'M DOING
A CORPUS CALLOSOTOMY.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.067
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO SCRUB IN.
ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHEN?

22:15.067 --> 22:16.400
MM-HMM.
I'M GONNA GUESS NOW.

22:16.433 --> 22:18.700
LOOK, IF YOU'RE BUSY,
DON'T BOTHER, BUT, YOU KNOW,

22:18.733 --> 22:21.600
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY.
HE'S CUTTING
A MAN'S BRAIN IN HALF.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.567
I'M SORRY.
I'M AN INTERN AND...

22:24.600 --> 22:28.133
I HAVE A LOT TO LEARN.
APPARENTLY SO DO I.

22:28.167 --> 22:30.433
IT'S OKAY.

22:30.467 --> 22:32.800
OH, SHOOT.

22:32.833 --> 22:35.133
I'LL CALL YOU TONIGHT.
OH, YOU'RE BUSY TONIGHT.
SHE HAS A DATE.

22:35.167 --> 22:36.833
***

22:36.867 --> 22:38.600
I'M SORRY, FINN.

22:38.633 --> 22:40.833
IT'S OKAY. GO.

22:40.867 --> 22:44.600
TAKE CARE.

22:44.633 --> 22:46.133
(laughs)

22:46.167 --> 22:48.567
I THINK I OWE YOU
ANOTHER 50.
YEAH, I THINK YOU DO.

22:57.133 --> 22:59.533
COMING OR GOING?

22:59.567 --> 23:01.100
I DON'T KNOW.

23:02.633 --> 23:04.667
ME NEITHER.

23:18.767 --> 23:20.433
THAT WAS BRILLIANT, REALLY.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.633
I THOUGHT SO, YES.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.300
IT WASN'T BECAUSE NOW
I OWE FINN ANOTHER DATE.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.167
THAT'S OKAY. HE NEEDS
ALL THE HELP HE CAN GET.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.100
THIS ISN'T GONNA
BE EASY FOR HIM.

23:28.133 --> 23:30.067
OH, YOU THINK
HE CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT?

23:30.067 --> 23:31.700
I THINK HE'S OUT
OF HIS LEAGUE.

23:31.733 --> 23:34.267
BUT YOU GOTTA HAND IT
TO THE GUY FOR TRYING.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.767
THIS IS MR. TRESSELT.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.433
PREP HIM.

23:37.467 --> 23:40.467
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE WERE OPERATING.
WE OPERATE AT 4:00.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.367
I'M NOT JUST GONNA SLIDE YOU
INTO THE O.R.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.700
YOU GOTTA WORK
A LITTLE, TOO, RIGHT?

23:54.833 --> 23:56.700
HOW MUCH IS THIS
GONNA COST MY PARENTS?

23:56.733 --> 24:00.067
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO BE WORRYING ABOUT.

24:00.067 --> 24:01.767
BUT THIS IS SO STUPID.
I'M FINE.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.500
HEY, PUNCH ME IN THE STOMACH,
RIGHT HERE.

24:04.533 --> 24:06.433
STOP TELLING PEOPLE
TO PUNCH YOU IN THE STOMACH.

24:06.467 --> 24:09.200
YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN
AND NOT MOVE.

24:09.233 --> 24:12.167
WHICH OF THE SUPERFRIENDS
CAN DO THAT?

24:12.200 --> 24:14.733
HI, MIRANDA.
YOU NEEDED A CONSULT?

24:14.767 --> 24:16.667
YEAH. JUST WAITING
FOR A PICTURE.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.567
(clears throat)

24:18.600 --> 24:19.600
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

24:19.633 --> 24:21.733
SINCE YOU WERE SUCKING DOWN
MARTINIS AT JOE'S.

24:21.767 --> 24:24.300
OH, YEAH. THAT WAS JUST--

24:24.333 --> 24:25.567
WELL, I'M--I'M OVER THAT.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.433
GOOD.

24:26.467 --> 24:28.533
WE TALKED ABOUT, UH--
A LOT OF THINGS.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.467
AND I REMEMBER--
NONE OF THEM.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.433
IS THAT FOR THE BEST?

24:32.467 --> 24:34.200
I THINK SO.

24:34.233 --> 24:38.067
SHE CAME IN FOR SUTURES,
BUT SHE'S A WALKING ACCIDENT

24:38.100 --> 24:39.833
AND HAS GOT AN OFF-THE-CHARTS
PAIN THRESHOLD.

24:39.867 --> 24:42.600
I'M THINKING--
CHRONIC INSENSITIVITY
TO PAIN, YEAH.

24:42.633 --> 24:45.500
I'VE SEEN IT IN BABIES.
IT'S USUALLY DIAGNOSED YOUNG.

24:45.533 --> 24:47.667
BUT... IF SHE'S BEEN
BOUNCED AROUND

24:47.700 --> 24:49.367
IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM--

24:49.400 --> 24:51.600
DR. BAILEY,
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

25:01.767 --> 25:03.233
DR. BURKE.

25:03.267 --> 25:04.833
OH, O'MALLEY, HOW ARE YOU?

25:04.867 --> 25:06.767
GOOD. HOW'S YOUR ARM?

25:06.800 --> 25:08.133
GOOD, GOOD. SLOW.

25:08.167 --> 25:10.567
P.T., YOU KNOW.
YEAH.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.467
WELL, UH, WE ALL MISS YOU
AROUND HERE.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.367
YOU'RE MISSED.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.200
HEY, O'MALLEY.

25:18.233 --> 25:20.467
STEVENS IS STANDING
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.800
I AM RETRACTING
THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE.

25:28.833 --> 25:31.133
WHAT DO WE WANT TO AVOID?
GREY?

25:31.167 --> 25:33.600
WE WANT TO AVOID RETRACTORS
ON THE SAGITTAL SINUS.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.300
THAT'S RIGHT. WHY?

25:35.333 --> 25:37.233
TO PREVENT SINUS THROMBOSIS.

25:37.267 --> 25:38.567
EXCELLENT.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.500
SAW DR. BURKE TODAY.
HE LOOKED GOOD.

25:40.533 --> 25:43.400
YEAH, HE LOOKS GREAT.
HE WAS MEETING WITH THE CHIEF.

25:43.433 --> 25:45.100
WORKING OUT THE LEAVE?

25:45.133 --> 25:46.300
THE WHAT?

25:46.333 --> 25:49.133
HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

25:49.167 --> 25:50.800
HIS WHAT?

25:52.833 --> 25:54.533
(mouths words)

25:54.567 --> 25:58.400
***

25:58.433 --> 26:00.567
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
OUT HERE FOR A WHILE.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.500
FOR A WHILE,
I STOOD OVER THERE.

26:02.533 --> 26:05.067
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN.
I DON'T WANT TO SIT DOWN.

26:05.067 --> 26:06.767
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN
ANYWAY.
GO INSIDE, GEORGE.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.200
IZZIE, SERIOUSLY THIS IS--

26:08.233 --> 26:10.300
I HATE THE BRIDE THING.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.233
I HATE THE PICTURES
IN THE MAGAZINES

26:12.267 --> 26:14.167
OF THE GIRL WITH THE VEIL

26:14.200 --> 26:16.067
AND THE FLOWERS
THAT SHE'S SNIFFING

26:16.100 --> 26:18.800
LIKE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER
TO STICK HER NOSE IN THERE

26:18.833 --> 26:20.733
UNTIL THERE WAS A CAMERA
POINTED AT HER.

26:20.767 --> 26:23.633
I HATE THE IDEA OF BRIDESMAIDS
AND THE COLORS

26:23.667 --> 26:26.533
AND "DOES THE BUSTLE MAKE
MY ASS LOOK BIGGER OR SMALLER?"

26:26.567 --> 26:29.433
I HATE THE WHOLE THING, AND I
NEVER WANTED TO BE THAT GIRL.

26:29.467 --> 26:32.233
THAT GIRL IS STUPID
AND SHALLOW.

26:32.267 --> 26:34.133
WHY THE HELL
IS THAT GIRL'S THOUGHTS

26:34.167 --> 26:35.667
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD?

26:35.700 --> 26:37.633
***

26:37.667 --> 26:39.100
IZZIE...

26:41.700 --> 26:43.600
I'M GOING TO DO IT,
GEORGE.

26:43.633 --> 26:45.533
I'M GOING TO WALK THROUGH
THOSE DOORS.

26:45.567 --> 26:47.700
I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN I'M STANDING

26:47.733 --> 26:49.633
IN FRONT OF
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY,

26:49.667 --> 26:51.567
I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT
MY WEDDING DRESS.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.400
AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE
ANOTHER MINUTE.

26:56.267 --> 26:59.167
***

27:01.633 --> 27:03.500
AND WITH SURGERY
OF THIS KIND,

27:03.533 --> 27:04.733
THERE'S ALWAYS RISK
OF AN INFECTION

27:04.767 --> 27:06.400
IF THE BONE IS COMPROMISED--

27:06.433 --> 27:08.733
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
I COULD DIE ON THE TABLE.

27:08.767 --> 27:10.667
WHERE DO I SIGN?
I THINK WE SHOULD

27:10.700 --> 27:12.600
TALK THROUGH THE REST
OF THIS CONSENT FORM FIRST.

27:12.633 --> 27:14.367
FOURTH SURGERY IN A YEAR--
I KNOW THE ROUTINE.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.167
WHEN I COME BACK IN
FOR MY HIP,

27:16.200 --> 27:18.833
YOU CAN GIVE ME THE SPEECH
IN FRENCH.
YOU'RE HAVING HIP SURGERY?

27:18.867 --> 27:21.333
IN THE FALL,
AFTER PATAGONIA.

27:25.467 --> 27:27.367
DO YOU STILL WANT
TO MEET YOUR GUY?

27:29.800 --> 27:31.700
MEGAN'S BLEEDING INTERNALLY.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.367
(man) WHAT?

27:33.400 --> 27:36.267
IT APPEARS THERE'S SOME
SEVERE TRAUMA TO HER ABDOMEN.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.867
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ASK US
IF WE HIT HER,

27:37.900 --> 27:40.733
WE'VE SAID TEN TIMES
AND IN TEN DIFFERENT WAYS--
SOCIAL SERVICES CLEARED YOU,

27:40.767 --> 27:44.067
AND I'M SORRY THAT WE SUGGESTED
YOU WERE MISTREATING HER.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.800
BUT SHE'S HURT PRETTY BADLY,
SO WE'RE GONNA NEED TO OPERATE.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.767
OH, MY GOD.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.067
(Addison) MEGAN MAY HAVE
A CHROMOSOMAL CONDITION

27:51.100 --> 27:54.267
THAT CAUSES HER TO NOT FEEL
ANY PAIN WHEN SHE'S INJURED.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.067
IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
SHE GETS HURT SO OFTEN.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.500
WE NEED TO DO SOME
GENETIC TESTING

27:57.533 --> 27:59.200
BEFORE WE CAN BE SURE,

27:59.233 --> 28:01.133
BUT LET'S ASSUME SHE'LL NEED
TO BE MONITORED

28:01.167 --> 28:02.167
VERY CLOSELY FROM NOW ON.

28:02.200 --> 28:06.300
WE GOT O.R. THREE.
SO SURGERY
IS THE ONLY OPTION?

28:06.333 --> 28:08.200
I THINK IT IS.

28:08.233 --> 28:10.800
I-I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN PUT THROUGH
THE WRINGER ALREADY TODAY,

28:10.833 --> 28:13.533
BUT I NEED TO ASK YOU
TO TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.500
WHERE IS SHE?

28:17.167 --> 28:18.600
WHERE'S MEGAN?

28:18.633 --> 28:20.400
SHE'S OVER...

28:20.433 --> 28:23.167
(elevator bell dings)

28:23.200 --> 28:25.267
HEY, A LEAVE OF ABSENCE?

28:25.300 --> 28:27.200
YEAH, I'M ON MY WAY HOME.

28:27.233 --> 28:29.133
I WAS JUST MAKING
SOME NOTES FOR THE CHIEF

28:29.167 --> 28:31.067
SO HE CAN REASSIGN
MY OPEN CASES.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.800
BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE?

28:32.833 --> 28:34.733
OKAY, THAT'S, LIKE,
WHAT, A WEEK?

28:34.767 --> 28:36.667
AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.600
WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE
THAT LONG.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.533
YOU'RE ALREADY THREE WEEKS
INTO P.T. ALREADY, SO--

28:40.567 --> 28:42.200
COME ON, RECOVERY FROM
BRACHIAL PLEXUS SURGERY

28:42.233 --> 28:44.133
IS MEASURED IN MONTHS,
CRISTINA,

28:44.167 --> 28:45.433
YEARS, NOT WEEKS.

28:45.467 --> 28:47.133
THE SURGERY'S CONSIDERED
A SUCCESS

28:47.167 --> 28:49.167
WHEN THE PATIENT
CAN FLEX THE ELBOW.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.100
SOME PATIENTS NEVER MOVE
THEIR SHOULDER AGAIN.

28:51.133 --> 28:52.300
SOME DON'T RECOVER SENSATION,

28:52.333 --> 28:54.067
THEY DON'T RECOVER DEXTERITY,

28:54.067 --> 28:55.700
THEY SIMPLY DON'T RECOVER.

28:55.733 --> 28:57.600
YES, BUT YOU ARE NOT
ONE OF THOSE.

28:57.633 --> 29:00.433
REALLY?

29:00.467 --> 29:03.233
SAYS WHO?

29:17.433 --> 29:19.400
THANKS, CARL.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.167
THAT'S MY GUY?

29:24.200 --> 29:25.667
NO, THAT'S NOT HIM.

29:25.700 --> 29:27.600
THAT'S SOMEONE ELSE
WE LOST LAST NIGHT.

29:27.633 --> 29:30.567
HE CAME IN FOR LIPO.
HE DIED ON THE TABLE.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.800
COMPLICATIONS.

29:31.833 --> 29:34.600
DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID
LIPOSUCTION ON MEN.

29:34.633 --> 29:37.500
PEOPLE DO A LOT OF STUFF
THEY DON'T NEED.

29:37.533 --> 29:41.233
AND, UH, THE OLDER YOU GET,
IT'S, UH...

29:41.267 --> 29:43.433
HERE HE IS.

29:46.433 --> 29:48.100
THAT'S YOUR GUY.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.467
THAT CAN'T BE MY GUY.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.833
HE'S REALLY OLD.

29:53.867 --> 29:55.833
HIS BONES
ARE PROBABLY BRITTLE.

29:55.867 --> 30:00.200
WHAT ARE THEY DOING USING
A GUY THAT OLD AS MY DONOR?

30:00.233 --> 30:02.300
HE'S TWO YEARS YOUNGER
THAN YOU ARE.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.200
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO MY ANKLE ALLOGRAFT?

30:08.233 --> 30:09.833
I HAD O.R. 2 AT 3:00.

30:09.867 --> 30:11.767
ANYBODY WANNA TELL ME
WHERE IT WENT?

30:11.800 --> 30:13.767
IT WAS CANCELED.
THE GUY WENT HOME.

30:13.800 --> 30:17.067
WHY THE HELL
WOULD HE DO THAT?

30:17.100 --> 30:19.500
HEY!
O'MALLEY!
WE'VE LOST SUPERGIRL,

30:19.533 --> 30:21.433
AND SHE'S BLEEDING
INTO HER ABDOMEN.

30:21.467 --> 30:23.367
START LOOKING IN CORNERS.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.067
DO YOU THINK YOU CUT ENOUGH
OF THE FIBERS OUT

30:25.100 --> 30:27.467
OR ARE YOU GONNA
HAVE TO GO BACK IN?
WE'LL SEE IF THE SEIZURES
ARE UNDER CONTROL.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.400
IF NOT, WE'LL GO BACK IN
FOR THE LAST THIRD.

30:29.433 --> 30:31.333
WELL, DO I GET TO SCRUB IN
ON THAT, TOO,

30:31.367 --> 30:33.267
OR ONLY IF I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DATE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

30:33.300 --> 30:35.767
I WOULDN'T CONSIDER A MEAL
IN THE CAFETERIA A DATE.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.167
DON'T DENIGRATE
THE COMPETITION.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.567
I HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT
FOR DR. DANDRIDGE.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.633
IT SHOWS COURAGE TO WOO
A WOMAN WITH A TUNA SALAD.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.633
KEEP AN EYE ON TAYLOR.
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM, PAGE ME.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.567
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE LOBBY AT 8:00.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.500
HEY, GREY, I LOST A KID.
HELP ME LOOK FOR HER

30:47.533 --> 30:49.533
BEFORE SHE BLEEDS OUT
IN ONE OF OUR BATHROOMS.

30:49.567 --> 30:51.333
WHAT'S HER NAME?
MEGAN!

30:51.367 --> 30:53.267
IT'S NOT EASY. IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE A SUPERHERO,

30:53.300 --> 30:55.200
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET SOMEONE
COME AT YOU WITH A KNIFE.

30:55.233 --> 30:57.133
THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL WHAT
IT CAN DO TO YOUR POWERS.

30:57.167 --> 30:59.067
I MEAN, IF YOU TAKE AWAY
GREEN LANTERN'S RING,

30:59.100 --> 31:00.833
HAL JORDAN IS STILL A HERO,

31:00.867 --> 31:02.733
BUT IT CREATES
A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE...

31:02.767 --> 31:05.633
(Alex) COME ON, MEGAN.
WHEN YOU'VE WORKED HARD
TO HONE YOUR STRENGTH.

31:05.667 --> 31:07.567
HEY, JUST LOOK AT,
UH, BATMAN.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.500
ROBIN JUST MARCHES INTO
THE BATCAVE,

31:09.533 --> 31:11.200
AND HE SAYS, YOU KNOW,

31:11.233 --> 31:13.133
"HERE I AM.
I'M GONNA LIVE HERE, TOO.

31:13.167 --> 31:16.067
GIVE ME SOME TIGHTS,
AND I'M TAKING YOUR TOWEL."
MEGAN.

31:16.067 --> 31:18.733
I MEAN, BATMAN, HE FOUGHT
FOR HIS POWERS, YOU KNOW?

31:18.767 --> 31:20.133
HE HONED HIS STRENGTH.

31:20.167 --> 31:21.633
DUDE,
IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS,

31:21.667 --> 31:23.567
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN THE FACE.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.767
O'MALLEY.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.467
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.333
I ARRANGE FOR YOU TO SEE
AN INCREDIBLY COOL SURGERY,

31:29.367 --> 31:31.267
AND YOU TALK MY PATIENT
OUT OF IT?
NO, I DIDN'T--

31:31.300 --> 31:33.467
YOU ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT,
YOU DIDN'T LIKE WHAT I SAID,

31:33.500 --> 31:35.067
SO YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK.
JASPER'S GONE.

31:35.067 --> 31:38.200
HE CANCELED THE SURGERY.
I EXPRESSED AN OPINION.
I SUGGESTED THAT, YOU KNOW,

31:38.233 --> 31:39.400
NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO GO
AT WARP SPEED.

31:39.433 --> 31:41.067
IT IS ALL WARP SPEED WITH YOU.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.067
IT IS ALL, "OH, YOUR ANKLE
HURTS? LET'S CUT IF OFF."
YOU INTIMIDATED MY PATIENT.

31:44.067 --> 31:45.800
YOU GOT A PROBLEM,
YOU BRING IT TO ME.

31:45.833 --> 31:48.567
I'M NOT READY FOR US
TO MOVE IN TOGETHER.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.433
AND IF YOU WEREN'T A TODDLER,
IF YOU COULD USE YOUR WORDS,

31:51.467 --> 31:52.767
THEN MAYBE
YOU COULD'VE SAID THAT

31:52.800 --> 31:54.700
THE FIRST FOUR TIMES
I ASKED YOU.

31:54.733 --> 31:56.767
AND THEN I WOULD'VE SAID,
"OH, THAT'S FUNNY, ME NEITHER.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.500
I'M LOOKING FOR A PLACE.
I'LL BE OUT IN A WEEK."
REALLY?
BECAUSE REMEMBER, YOU--

31:59.533 --> 32:03.233
GEORGE, SAVE IT. I'LL BE--
I'LL BE OUT IN AN HOUR.

32:05.233 --> 32:07.200
MEGAN.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.733
MEGAN.

32:13.633 --> 32:15.467
MEGAN. OH.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.600
HI.

32:16.633 --> 32:18.500
WEREN'T YOU
JUST UP ON THREE?

32:18.533 --> 32:21.367
I WAS. WE LOST A PATIENT,
A LITTLE GIRL, AND I WAS JUST--

32:21.400 --> 32:24.300
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
PICK A FLOOR AND STAY ON IT,

32:24.333 --> 32:26.233
AND I'LL PICK A FLOOR
ON STAY ON THAT?

32:26.267 --> 32:29.567
BECAUSE I REALLY NEED
A MOMENT OR TWO WITHOUT YOU.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.067
YOUR FACE SHOWS UP IN MY HEAD,

32:32.100 --> 32:34.700
YOUR... PANTIES SHOW UP
IN MY HUSBAND'S POCKET--

32:34.733 --> 32:35.833
REALLY, YOU'RE EVERYWHERE--

32:35.867 --> 32:39.067
AND I NEED A MOMENT OR TWO
WITHOUT YOU.
I GET THAT.

32:39.067 --> 32:41.567
THANKS.

32:43.533 --> 32:45.100
(sighs)

32:45.133 --> 32:47.233
MEGAN.

32:47.267 --> 32:50.233
COME ON. ENOUGH ALREADY.

32:50.267 --> 32:53.100
OH, JEEZ.

32:54.567 --> 32:56.233
WE GOT HALF THE HOSPITAL
LOOKING FOR YOU.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.700
YOUR POWERS OF INVISIBILITY
ARE WELL INTACT. GET UP.

32:58.733 --> 33:00.633
YOU'RE A HOSEBAG,
YOU KNOW THAT?

33:00.667 --> 33:02.533
AND YOU HAVE
A POTTY MOUTH.

33:02.567 --> 33:04.500
NOBODY'S CUTTING ME OPEN.

33:04.533 --> 33:06.633
HEY, IT'S SURGERY.
WE DO IT ALL THE TIME.

33:06.667 --> 33:08.567
IN FACT, IT'S ALL WE DO.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.133
YOU CAN'T KEEP TELLING
MY FOSTER PARENTS I'M DEFECTIVE.

33:11.167 --> 33:13.067
THEY CAN'T AFFORD SURGERY.
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

33:13.100 --> 33:16.067
THEY CAN HANDLE IT.
THEY'LL SEND ME BACK.

33:18.767 --> 33:21.400
DUDE, THAT'S STUPID.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.533
THEY GOT THEIR OWN
PERSONAL SUPERHERO.

33:23.567 --> 33:25.467
NOBODY SENDS BACK
A SUPERHERO.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.500
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
I DIDN'T HAVE SUPERPOWERS?

33:28.533 --> 33:29.700
YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T.

33:29.733 --> 33:31.633
BUT TAKE AWAY
GREEN LANTERN'S RING,

33:31.667 --> 33:34.767
THE GUY'S STILL A HERO,
RIGHT?

33:38.400 --> 33:41.600
OKAY. CLOSE YOUR EYES.
SQUEEZE 'EM TIGHT.

33:41.633 --> 33:43.600
GOOD. OKAY.
CAN YOU SQUEEZE MY FINGERS?

33:43.633 --> 33:44.733
FANTASTIC.

33:44.767 --> 33:47.267
LET'S WIGGLE YOUR TOES
FOR ME, PLEASE.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.800
VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.500
FLYING COLORS.

33:50.533 --> 33:52.067
HE'S ALWAYS TESTED WELL.

33:52.100 --> 33:54.100
I KICKED ASS ON THE, UH...

33:54.133 --> 33:56.067
WHAT--WHAT'S IT CALLED?

33:56.067 --> 33:58.167
THE S.A.T.s.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.667
NOW CAN YOU TELL ME,
WHAT IS THIS?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.500
HONEY?

34:10.767 --> 34:13.300
TAKE YOUR TIME.

34:13.333 --> 34:16.233
HONEY, WHAT'S THAT CALLED?
IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.833
CAN YOU SEE THIS HERE?
I CAN SEE IT.

34:20.867 --> 34:22.767
I-I JUST CAN'T THINK
OF THE...

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S OKAY. TAKE YOUR TIME.

34:24.833 --> 34:27.100
SEE, SOMETIMES THE NAMES
OF THINGS ARE TOUGH.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.067
SO TRY AGAIN.

34:32.700 --> 34:34.533
WHAT'S MY NAME?

34:36.800 --> 34:39.300
I CAN'T...

34:39.333 --> 34:41.533
WH-WHAT'S HIS NAME?

34:41.567 --> 34:44.067
I-I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

34:44.067 --> 34:45.367
I-I-I JUST...

34:45.400 --> 34:48.100
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
LEANNE, LET'S JUST
GIVE HIM A MOMENT.

34:50.867 --> 34:52.100
IT...

34:54.633 --> 34:57.100
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
I...

35:06.167 --> 35:07.367
HE NAMED THE BABY.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.267
HE NAMED HIM
AFTER HIS FATHER.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.267
MM.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.567
HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THE NAME
OF YOUR OWN BABY?

35:12.600 --> 35:14.067
WELL, HE KNOWS
WHO THE BABY IS.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.700
SEE, THE RIGHT SIDE
OF THE BRAIN

35:15.733 --> 35:17.633
SENSES EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
TO THE BABY.

35:17.667 --> 35:19.567
IT JUST CAN'T COMMUNICATE
WITH THE LEFT BRAIN

35:19.600 --> 35:21.433
WHERE THE WORDS ARE FORMED.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.367
THE PATHWAY TO THE TWO SIDES
HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.267
HE NEEDS TO MAKE
NEW PATHWAYS.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.467
HOW LONG IS THAT GONNA TAKE?
WELL, HE'LL GET THERE.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.067
RECOVERY IS HARD WORK.

35:29.100 --> 35:32.067
IT'S A LEARNING PROCESS.
YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.833
YOU NEED TO HELP HIM.
(Leanne sobs)

35:33.867 --> 35:37.767
HE CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.567
(Alex) MAN, SHE WASN'T KIDDING
ABOUT THE BASEBALL BAT.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.500
I NEED MORE LAP PADS.
JUST KEEP 'EM COMING.

35:42.533 --> 35:44.400
ARE YOU GONNA
RESECT THE LIVER?

35:44.433 --> 35:46.333
I NEED TO TRY
AND DO A DEBRIDEMENT.

35:46.367 --> 35:48.367
LOOK AT THIS.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.767
EVERYBODY WANTS A LIFE
WITHOUT PAIN,

35:50.800 --> 35:52.667
AND WHAT DOES IT GET YOU?

35:52.700 --> 35:54.600
SHE NEEDS TO BE
ON A POSTER SOMEWHERE

35:54.633 --> 35:58.067
TO REMIND PEOPLE
PAIN'S THERE FOR A REASON.

36:15.867 --> 36:17.233
MEGAN'S STABLE.

36:17.267 --> 36:19.233
I ORDERED A REPEAT H&H
IN TWO HOURS.

36:19.267 --> 36:21.767
SHE BEEN OUT THERE
ALL DAY?

36:28.833 --> 36:30.333
DINNER WAS GOOD.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.300
DINNER WAS EXCELLENT.

36:32.333 --> 36:33.500
ARE YOU COMING IN?

36:33.533 --> 36:35.200
I DON'T KNOW. AM I?

36:35.233 --> 36:37.267
WELL, YOU COULD COME IN
FOR A DRINK

36:37.300 --> 36:39.100
OR A-A COFFEE.

36:39.133 --> 36:41.167
I OWE YOU ONE
FROM THIS MORNING.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.667
YEAH, YOU DO.
(laughs)

36:42.700 --> 36:44.600
(Finn) HI.
FINN.

36:44.633 --> 36:46.133
I DIDN'T THINK YOU GUYS
WOULD BE HERE.

36:46.167 --> 36:47.633
I JUST WANTED
TO DROP THIS OFF.

36:47.667 --> 36:50.367
IT'S STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.
A PATIENT MADE IT FOR ME.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.733
PATIENT'S OWNER.
IT'S MADE FROM SCRATCH.
REAL STRAWBERRIES.

36:52.767 --> 36:54.300
I LOVE STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.

36:54.333 --> 36:55.633
AND HE REMEMBERED.
I DID.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.533
I JUST THOUGHT I'D
LEAVE IT BY THE DOOR.

36:57.567 --> 36:59.467
OH, YOU DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD MELT?
NO, YOU TAKE YOUR CHANCES.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.800
WORKED OUT FOR YOU.
WHAT EXACTLY
IS GOING ON HERE?

37:01.833 --> 37:03.700
HE'S CRASHING OUR DATE.
WHERE DO YOU THINK
I GOT THAT IDEA?

37:03.733 --> 37:05.700
I DIDN'T CRASH YOUR DATE.
IT WAS PROFESSIONAL.
YOU CAN'T OPERATE
WITHOUT HER?

37:05.733 --> 37:07.567
I CERTAINLY OPERATE WELL
WITH HER.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.667
ENOUGH.
THIS IS NOT DATING.

37:09.700 --> 37:12.300
I WANT MOONLIGHT AND FLOWERS

37:12.333 --> 37:14.233
AND CANDY AND PEOPLE
TRYING TO FEEL ME UP.

37:14.267 --> 37:16.300
NOBODY IS TRYING
TO FEEL ME UP.

37:16.333 --> 37:18.233
NOBODY IS EVEN LOOKING
AT ME.

37:18.267 --> 37:19.367
I'M AN INTERN.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.733
DO THE TWO OF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH EFFORT IT TAKES

37:21.767 --> 37:22.800
TO DO ALL THIS?

37:22.833 --> 37:25.600
I'M WAXED AND PLUCKED,
AND I HAVE A CLEAN TOP ON.

37:25.633 --> 37:28.300
AND THE TWO OF YOU
ARE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER.
MEREDITH, IT'S--

37:28.333 --> 37:31.600
NO! MY FANTASY IS NOT
TWO MEN LOOKING AT EACH OTHER.
WE DIDN'T--

37:31.633 --> 37:33.800
NO TALKING
UNTIL ONE OF YOU FIGURES OUT

37:33.833 --> 37:36.333
HOW TO PUT ON A DATE.
I WANT HEAT, I WANT ROMANCE.

37:36.367 --> 37:39.500
DAMN IT, I WANNA FEEL
LIKE A FREAKIN' LADY!

37:39.533 --> 37:41.333
***

37:41.367 --> 37:44.167
THE FANTASY IS SIMPLE...

37:44.200 --> 37:46.667
***

37:46.700 --> 37:48.833
PLEASURE IS GOOD...

37:48.867 --> 37:51.733
AHEM. I'M IN
ROOM 22-SOMETHING--2214.

37:51.767 --> 37:53.667
IF ANYONE CALLS,
I'M NOT HERE.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.367
YES, MA'AM.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.533
AND TWICE AS MUCH PLEASURE
IS BETTER...

37:58.567 --> 37:59.733
HI. CHECKING IN, PLEASE.

37:59.767 --> 38:01.433
(man) CERTAINLY.
ROOM FOR...

38:01.467 --> 38:02.400
ONE.

38:02.433 --> 38:03.600
THAT PAIN IS BAD...

38:03.633 --> 38:06.233
ROOM 1817. ANY MESSAGES?

38:06.267 --> 38:07.433
AND NO PAIN IS BETTER.

38:07.467 --> 38:09.367
CHECKING IN, PLEASE.
ROOM FOR ONE.

38:09.400 --> 38:12.267
SOMETHING ON THE 22nd FLOOR
IF YOU'VE GOT IT.

38:12.300 --> 38:14.667
(woman)
I'LL TAKE A LOOK.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.433
DR. SLOAN?

38:16.467 --> 38:18.500
DR. WEBBER.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.633
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN SEATTLE?

38:20.667 --> 38:22.300
I DON'T KNOW.

38:23.567 --> 38:26.300
I HAVE A THING
FOR FERRY BOATS.

38:26.333 --> 38:29.067
BUT THE REALITY IS DIFFERENT.

38:29.067 --> 38:31.800
***

38:36.233 --> 38:38.500
ARE YOU COOKING FOR ME?

38:38.533 --> 38:39.533
I AM NOT.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.100
YOU CAN TAKE A LEAVE
OF ABSENCE IF YOU WANT TO,

38:42.133 --> 38:44.733
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA SIT
ON YOUR ASS ALL DAY.

38:44.767 --> 38:46.667
YOU'RE GONNA WORK HARD
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET

38:46.700 --> 38:49.267
EVERY BIT OF YOUR STRENGTH
AND DEXTERITY BACK.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.200
REALLY? HOW?

38:51.233 --> 38:54.167
***

39:03.833 --> 39:05.500
PUT IT BACK TOGETHER.

39:05.533 --> 39:10.667
THE REALITY IS THAT PAIN
IS THERE TO TELL US SOMETHING.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.500
***

39:12.533 --> 39:13.467
IZ.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.167
I'LL DO IT.

39:15.200 --> 39:15.967
IZZIE.

39:16.067 --> 39:18.400
I CAN DO IT, ALEX.
I KNOW I CAN.

39:18.433 --> 39:21.133
(sighs) DOES IT HURT?

39:23.267 --> 39:25.567
YEAH.

39:25.600 --> 39:29.633
WHERE DOES IT HURT?

39:32.767 --> 39:34.733
EVERYWHERE.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.333
MAYBE IT HURTS
FOR A REASON.

39:41.167 --> 39:43.733
COME ON.

39:43.767 --> 39:45.100
LET'S GO.

39:45.133 --> 39:48.067
***

39:50.667 --> 39:53.800
AND THERE'S ONLY
SO MUCH PLEASURE WE CAN TAKE

39:53.833 --> 39:56.100
WITHOUT GETTING A STOMACHACHE.

39:56.133 --> 39:58.233
AND MAYBE THAT'S OKAY.

39:58.267 --> 39:59.300
HEY.

39:59.333 --> 40:01.233
***

40:01.267 --> 40:03.167
I DIDN'T GO IN TODAY.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.400
MAYBE TOMORROW.

40:07.133 --> 40:10.100
***

40:13.567 --> 40:16.000
HEY, GEORGE.

40:17.767 --> 40:20.633
CALLIE MOVED OUT,
WHICH IS A RELIEF.

40:20.667 --> 40:25.233
OH, I AM SO RELIEVED.

40:26.433 --> 40:28.167
STRAWBERRY.

40:28.200 --> 40:31.200
***

40:35.700 --> 40:37.367
IT'S GOOD.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.300
YOU LEFT SPIT ON THE SPOON.
NO, I DIDN'T.

40:39.333 --> 40:41.600
YOU DID, A LITTLE.

40:41.633 --> 40:43.667
MAYBE SOME FANTASIES

40:43.700 --> 40:48.200
ARE ONLY SUPPOSED TO LIVE
IN OUR DREAMS.
