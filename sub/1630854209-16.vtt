WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:03.480
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...

00:03.680 --> 00:04.680
Now, that is
gonna beat anyone

00:04.880 --> 00:06.090
that you go against
on Saturday.

00:06.290 --> 00:07.220
Georgia quit.
She asked that

00:07.420 --> 00:08.620
neither one of us
contact her.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.090
It's better if we
just leave her alone.

00:11.290 --> 00:12.390
MORALES:
Rough night of bouncing?

00:12.590 --> 00:13.660
Corinne was
counting on me

00:13.860 --> 00:15.160
to come up
with the money

00:15.360 --> 00:16.460
to keep the lights on
in that joint.

00:16.660 --> 00:17.830
She still has to be
able to count on me.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.730
Thank you for waiting, sir.
You can come on in.

00:19.930 --> 00:22.040
What do they pay you to do what
you do here? I'll triple it.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.400
Yeah, who are you?

00:23.600 --> 00:25.300
Bobby Azeroff.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.910
Ma? What are
you doing here?

00:27.110 --> 00:28.570
I didn't like the way you
sounded on the phone yesterday.

00:28.770 --> 00:30.410
You didn't have
to come here.

00:30.610 --> 00:32.110
I wanted to, okay?

00:32.310 --> 00:34.010
I showed up for you.

00:34.210 --> 00:36.020
SUAREZ:
Consultant to Raymond Sharpe was
in the car without my knowledge.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.920
He, uh, made a recording
of cops being derelict

00:39.120 --> 00:40.650
and me stopping it.

00:40.850 --> 00:43.420
I'm sorry I embarrassed you

00:43.620 --> 00:45.060
and your officers.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.430
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry that you got fired.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.360
It's not without its upsides.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.350
(scoffs)
What?

00:57.320 --> 00:59.340
* I'm feeling good today *

00:59.540 --> 01:01.670
* I've rearranged my space *

01:01.870 --> 01:03.710
* Might catch some sun,
might find someone *

01:03.910 --> 01:06.630
* To take me another place *

01:35.990 --> 01:38.060
(car engine starts)

01:42.300 --> 01:44.650
KEE:
<i>All right, ladies and gents,</i>
<i>here are our numbers.</i>

01:44.850 --> 01:46.520
Robberies are
down 12%,

01:46.720 --> 01:48.890
street assaults
have declined 18.

01:49.090 --> 01:50.820
Not too shabby. Uh,
seems like the increased

01:51.020 --> 01:53.360
foot posts are working,
although... (chuckles)

01:53.560 --> 01:54.660
...some of you have failed

01:54.860 --> 01:56.730
to pass out cards with
your contact numbers.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.060
They have my number. It's 911.

01:59.270 --> 02:00.830
That's a new one.

02:01.030 --> 02:02.400
All right, folks,
let's listen up.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.970
Inspector.
Thank you.

02:04.170 --> 02:07.010
I've received information
from the Intelligence Division

02:07.210 --> 02:09.980
about a smash-and-grab
robbery pattern.

02:10.180 --> 02:12.750
They've hit three luxury
stores in the past month.

02:12.950 --> 02:15.150
One in the West Village, one
in the Meatpacking District,

02:15.350 --> 02:16.450
one on Madison Avenue.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.120
Mostly they take jewelry,

02:19.320 --> 02:21.020
watches and high-end handbags.

02:21.220 --> 02:22.820
So, all in Manhattan?

02:23.020 --> 02:24.320
Ain't no high-end handbags
in East New York.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.660
Also they take
the surveillance servers.

02:26.860 --> 02:30.300
Suspects seen fleeing in
an early 2000s Honda Accord,

02:30.500 --> 02:32.930
gold-colored with
what's been identified

02:33.130 --> 02:34.430
as Cragar mag wheels.

02:34.630 --> 02:35.470
We get a plate on that?

02:35.670 --> 02:36.900
They covered it.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.170
Intelligence thinks

02:38.370 --> 02:40.240
they're working
out of East New York.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.340
Have all units
be on the lookout.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.730
* *

02:49.770 --> 02:51.380
I ain't putting up
with it no more!

02:51.580 --> 02:53.550
WOMAN:
I ain't putting up
with it neither.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.090
Oh, no, not
these two again.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.890
I hate you, Alice.
SANDEFORD:
Hold on, now.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.660
What's going on?
He threw my
clothes out the window

02:58.860 --> 03:00.960
'cause I had the audacity
to talk to another man.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.060
She don't tell you that
she slept with the man.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.660
17 years ago. 17 years ago
I was married to him.

03:05.860 --> 03:06.930
Wait, don't you think
that's a little bit

03:07.130 --> 03:08.370
of an overreaction,
don't you think?

03:08.570 --> 03:10.000
'Cause I don't want
her wined and dined

03:10.200 --> 03:11.670
by some guy think he
Billy Dee Williams?

03:11.870 --> 03:14.540
I said I would
take him for dialysis.
Okay.

03:14.740 --> 03:15.770
17 years ago
seems like

03:15.970 --> 03:17.110
it could be water
under the bridge, no?

03:17.310 --> 03:18.440
Thank you, young man.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.110
I really like
that you said that.

03:20.310 --> 03:21.550
MAN:
You see how she do?

03:21.750 --> 03:23.620
She make me a cuckold
with any man she meet.

03:23.820 --> 03:25.180
Do you want a divorce?

03:25.380 --> 03:26.420
If this fool be
threatened by me

03:26.620 --> 03:27.820
driving to Mount Sinai
twice a week,

03:28.020 --> 03:29.390
I most certainly do
want a divorce.

03:29.590 --> 03:31.320
You want a divorce?
I am definitely

03:31.520 --> 03:32.590
considering it. Hell yeah.

03:32.790 --> 03:33.560
Well, forget about
considering it.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.590
Come on over here and put

03:34.790 --> 03:35.760
your finger on my shield.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.000
Come on.
We gonna do this.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.800
Put your finger
on my shield.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.800
By the power
vested in me

03:43.000 --> 03:44.570
by the State
of New York,

03:44.770 --> 03:48.010
I do hereby declare
your matrimonial union

03:48.210 --> 03:49.740
to be null and void from

03:49.940 --> 03:51.910
this day forward,
to the end of time...

03:52.110 --> 03:54.080
Wait, wait, wait.
You're saying that does it?

03:54.280 --> 03:55.550
That's right, Albert.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.320
As soon as you take
your finger off my shield,

03:57.520 --> 03:59.720
you and Alice are officially
no longer husband and wife.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.690
ALICE: That's not
what I want, Albert.

04:01.890 --> 04:04.120
Well, it ain't
what I want either.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.810
Well, how about if
I drive him once a week?

04:07.680 --> 04:09.730
I can live with that.

04:09.930 --> 04:11.560
So, put a hold on the divorce?

04:11.760 --> 04:13.570
Yes, please.
Then fold these
damn clothes

04:13.770 --> 04:15.470
and put them back
in the house.

04:15.670 --> 04:17.590
Stop all that nonsense.

04:18.450 --> 04:19.710
DISPATCHER:
7-4 Precinct,

04:19.910 --> 04:21.040
I have a 10-59,

04:21.240 --> 04:23.180
vehicle on fire
at 9183 Fulton Street.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.510
Any units available.

04:24.710 --> 04:25.840
7-4 Foot Patrol 8-9.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.510
We're around the block,
we'll handle.

04:27.710 --> 04:30.300
DISPATCHER:
10-4. FD notified.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.770
SANDEFORD:
Aw, man.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.520
That's a Honda.
SANDEFORD:
Central, be advised...

04:37.720 --> 04:39.160
That's a Honda Accord.
...we found

04:39.360 --> 04:40.990
what looks like to be
a Honda Accord on fire.

04:41.190 --> 04:42.360
DISPATCHER:
10-4. FD en route.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.930
And those are Cragars.

04:45.130 --> 04:46.830
This is the car.

04:47.030 --> 04:49.230
It's good nobody's
in there.
Yeah.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.620
(sirens wailing)

05:00.530 --> 05:01.410
SANDEFORD:
What are the chances

05:01.610 --> 05:02.420
the VIN's
still readable?

05:02.620 --> 05:04.450
I don't know.

05:04.650 --> 05:05.880
It's in at least
four different places.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.220
And you know those
four different places

05:08.420 --> 05:09.220
on this
particular car?

05:09.420 --> 05:10.520
Guess we'll see.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.090
Sometimes I think you
say you know something

05:12.290 --> 05:14.390
whether or not
you actually know it.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.090
Huh?
I said sometimes

05:16.290 --> 05:18.100
I think you say
you know something

05:18.300 --> 05:20.480
whether or not you know it.

05:22.590 --> 05:23.840
Well...

05:24.040 --> 05:25.820
this was stamped
on the crossmember.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.510
Looks like
a VIN to me.

05:28.710 --> 05:29.580
You're starting to remind me

05:29.780 --> 05:31.060
of Captain Yenko, you know?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.230
(indistinct chatter)

05:39.300 --> 05:41.190
You can't block the hydrant.

05:41.390 --> 05:42.990
Yo, two minutes.

05:43.190 --> 05:45.660
How's it going, Stuffy?
I'm good.

05:45.860 --> 05:47.130
How about yourself, Officer?

05:47.330 --> 05:49.160
Doing good.
Salaam alaikum to
you, my sister.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.500
Wa alaikum salaam.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.730
This stuff didn't
fall off

05:51.930 --> 05:52.500
the back of a truck,
did it, Stuffy?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.030
No, ma'am.

05:54.230 --> 05:55.230
I don't want to find out
that you're moving

05:55.430 --> 05:56.670
stolen merchandise.

05:56.870 --> 05:58.400
I can show you a receipt
for everything I carry.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.620
Okay.

06:01.590 --> 06:03.290
Have a nice day.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.750
What this smash-and-grab
crew takes is higher-end.
(phone rings)

06:06.950 --> 06:09.280
Yeah. Well, it doesn't
hurt to let him know

06:09.480 --> 06:11.220
that we're still
paying attention.

06:11.420 --> 06:13.590
Hey, Ma.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.950
Hey. I thought I'd
straighten up around here,

06:15.150 --> 06:16.360
but you don't have a Swiffer?

06:16.560 --> 06:17.720
No.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.530
Well, where's the local
hardware store?

06:19.730 --> 06:21.360
Ma, I don't need a Swiffer.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.530
(kettle whistles)
Oh, Brandy, you know what,
the water's boiling.

06:22.730 --> 06:23.530
Can I call you back?

06:23.730 --> 06:24.530
Sure.

06:24.730 --> 06:25.830
All right, bye.

06:26.030 --> 06:27.200
Well, that's cute.
Your mom wants to

06:27.400 --> 06:28.430
buy you a Swiffer.

06:28.630 --> 06:30.370
Yep, the woman's tidy.

06:30.570 --> 06:32.140
Hates a mess,

06:32.340 --> 06:33.860
except for
in her own life.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.880
Hey. Is, um...

06:40.080 --> 06:41.680
Has Corinne been
in touch with you?

06:41.880 --> 06:43.450
No, why would she be?

06:43.650 --> 06:44.680
I don't know,

06:44.880 --> 06:47.850
see-see how I'm doing,
see if I'm fine?

06:48.050 --> 06:50.620
You're not too much of
a narcissist, are you?

06:50.820 --> 06:51.920
Well, if she does call,
you could tell her

06:52.120 --> 06:54.710
I'm doing fine,
'cause-'cause I am.

06:55.510 --> 06:56.880
Good.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.020
Totally fine.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.290
(Killian sighs)

07:10.660 --> 07:11.580
Can I help you?

07:11.780 --> 07:13.280
Ms. Wilson?
Uh-huh.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.210
I'm Detective Killian,
this is Detective Morales.

07:16.410 --> 07:17.580
We're from the 7-4 squad.

07:17.780 --> 07:20.090
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

07:20.290 --> 07:21.750
Why would someone
set fire to my car?

07:21.950 --> 07:23.490
It's possible your
car was involved

07:23.690 --> 07:24.860
in the robbery of a store.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.130
Did we have anything in it?
Do you know?

07:27.330 --> 07:28.990
I think Bianca had a pair
of Jordans in the backseat.

07:29.190 --> 07:31.800
Oh. She's not gonna like that.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.870
Your car wasn't
reported stolen.

07:34.070 --> 07:35.330
We didn't know
it was stolen.

07:35.530 --> 07:38.440
We don't use it unless we
absolutely have to, okay?

07:38.640 --> 07:39.770
We both take
public transportation

07:39.970 --> 07:41.010
to and from
work, so...

07:41.210 --> 07:42.740
Is there anyone else
who uses it?

07:42.940 --> 07:43.740
Our daughter.

07:43.940 --> 07:44.940
Could we talk to her?

07:45.140 --> 07:45.910
Bianca,

07:46.110 --> 07:47.730
would you come down here, honey?

07:50.330 --> 07:51.420
Our car was stolen.

07:51.620 --> 07:52.490
You're kidding.

07:52.690 --> 07:54.220
Stolen and set fire to.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.270
Oh, God.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.530
When's the last time
you used it, Bianca?

08:01.730 --> 08:03.730
Uh, I don't know.

08:03.930 --> 08:04.730
A week ago, maybe?

08:04.930 --> 08:05.930
Is it possible

08:06.130 --> 08:06.830
anyone you know
might've used it?

08:07.030 --> 08:07.830
Well, I'm not gonna

08:08.030 --> 08:09.700
loan out my parents' car.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.370
Actually, it might
have been involved

08:11.570 --> 08:13.170
in a string
of robberies.

08:13.370 --> 08:14.240
Like of people's houses?

08:14.440 --> 08:15.410
Stores.

08:15.610 --> 08:16.410
It's those
stupid mag wheels

08:16.610 --> 08:17.940
you got, Daddy.

08:18.140 --> 08:19.440
Some gangbanger wannabe
thought they looked cool.

08:19.650 --> 08:21.910
Well, we have a lot of
security camera footage

08:22.110 --> 08:23.220
we have to go through.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.250
We'll let you know
what we find out.

08:25.450 --> 08:27.070
Thank you.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.960
The daughter didn't
seem all that interested

08:37.160 --> 08:39.570
in the Jordans she
left in the backseat.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.200
She probably forgot
they were there.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.170
Hmm.

08:42.370 --> 08:44.340
The family
don't have money.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.370
I would think
that that's

08:46.570 --> 08:48.220
the first thing
she'd think of.

08:53.430 --> 08:54.510
Good. Good.

08:54.710 --> 08:55.760
Yeah.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.620
Hey, anything on that,
uh, pattern robbery crew?

08:59.820 --> 09:01.090
No, not yet.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.140
Want to show some, uh,
initiative on that one.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.660
Not because we always do,

09:06.860 --> 09:09.360
or there's something
particular about this case?

09:09.560 --> 09:12.000
This crew hits places
where rich people shop.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.970
Some of those people
have power,

09:14.170 --> 09:15.800
including power over us,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.700
so they need to know
we're paying attention.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.710
Need to show
we're getting results.

09:20.910 --> 09:22.170
This have something to do with

09:22.370 --> 09:24.240
getting Raymond Sharpe
elected mayor, or...

09:24.440 --> 09:26.160
anything like that?

09:30.430 --> 09:32.920
You know, I thought to myself,
I don't know,

09:33.120 --> 09:35.750
I don't want to be part
of Raymond Sharpe's circle.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.890
I definitely wasn't
looking to be rewarded

09:38.090 --> 09:39.730
with any kind of promotion,

09:39.930 --> 09:41.560
let alone being
made P.C.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.930
But I guess,

09:43.130 --> 09:45.230
if it doesn't compromise
the way I do my job,

09:45.430 --> 09:47.100
which it hasn't,

09:47.300 --> 09:48.470
I wouldn't mind

09:48.670 --> 09:51.020
seeing good things happen
for either one of us.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.420
Maybe they will.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.380
YENKO:
<i>This is Bianca Wilson's</i>

10:01.580 --> 10:02.650
social media page.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.120
MORALES:
A real fashionista, this one.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.150
YENKO:
This is an Alexander
McQueen peplum skirt

10:07.350 --> 10:09.520
reported stolen
from Intermix.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.520
What's peplum?

10:10.720 --> 10:11.760
It's a skirt that kind of

10:11.960 --> 10:12.860
flanges out to the side.

10:13.060 --> 10:13.890
Yeah, is that right?

10:14.090 --> 10:16.310
Really?
You got to ask her?

10:17.580 --> 10:18.730
All right,
next image, please.

10:18.930 --> 10:20.370
Okay, these are
cloisonné bracelets

10:20.570 --> 10:22.640
that were reported stolen
from the Dover Street Market.

10:22.840 --> 10:23.900
Where are we?

10:24.100 --> 10:25.070
MORALES:
Captain Yenko's

10:25.270 --> 10:26.400
taking us through
some of the items

10:26.600 --> 10:29.240
reported stolen from
previous pattern robberies

10:29.440 --> 10:31.780
apparently being worn by
Bianca Wilson and her friends.

10:31.980 --> 10:32.810
Is that the daughter
of the people

10:33.010 --> 10:34.180
who owned the getaway car?

10:34.380 --> 10:35.380
KILLIAN:
Yeah, and the security
camera footage

10:35.580 --> 10:36.680
gives us three
individuals

10:36.880 --> 10:37.750
running out of the stores

10:37.950 --> 10:39.120
and jumping into a Honda Accord.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.050
We sure they're posing
with stolen items?

10:41.250 --> 10:43.760
YENKO:
Yeah. Can I have the
previous image, please?

10:43.960 --> 10:46.590
This is an Alexander
McQueen peplum skirt

10:46.790 --> 10:48.360
that's very
distinctive.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.900
You know, maybe I'm
just being a romantic,

10:50.100 --> 10:50.960
but what it tells me

10:51.160 --> 10:52.230
is that we ought to be looking

10:52.430 --> 10:53.900
at her boyfriend
as a possible suspect.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.470
No, that's not
being romantic.

10:55.670 --> 10:58.870
Is there anything that
conclusively establishes

10:59.070 --> 11:00.470
the perps as being male?

11:00.670 --> 11:01.910
Not conclusively, no.

11:02.110 --> 11:04.340
Between the getaway car,
the stolen merchandise

11:04.540 --> 11:06.980
that Bianca and her
friends were wearing,

11:07.180 --> 11:08.010
I'd say the crew
we're looking for

11:08.210 --> 11:10.230
is made up of teenage girls.

11:18.870 --> 11:20.390
Bianca, where were you

11:20.590 --> 11:23.000
around 2:00 yesterday afternoon?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.360
What does that have
to do with anything?

11:25.560 --> 11:26.670
Daddy, stop.

11:26.870 --> 11:28.130
I was studying for AP calculus

11:28.330 --> 11:29.100
with my friend Tootie.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.640
We're gonna want to talk to your

11:30.840 --> 11:32.440
friend Tootie.
I don't understand.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.290
Do you suspect us
of something?

11:36.790 --> 11:38.610
These are some
pricey articles

11:38.810 --> 11:40.850
of clothing, Bianca.

11:41.050 --> 11:42.050
Where'd you get them?

11:42.250 --> 11:43.350
Flea markets,

11:43.550 --> 11:45.280
online, vintage stores.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.280
I know how to shop.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.890
That she does.

11:48.090 --> 11:50.660
Well, would you mind if we
looked through your closet?

11:50.860 --> 11:52.160
Yeah, I'd mind.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.390
Where do you get off
treating us like criminals?

11:54.590 --> 11:56.030
Ms. Wilson, your car
matches the description

11:56.230 --> 11:57.700
of the car used
in these robberies.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.160
Now, your
daughter appears

11:59.360 --> 12:00.800
to be in possession
of articles

12:01.000 --> 12:02.370
stolen in these robberies.

12:02.570 --> 12:03.770
You ever heard of knock-offs?

12:03.970 --> 12:05.740
Well, that's why we
want to look at them,

12:05.940 --> 12:07.640
determine if they're knock-offs.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.880
A Black girl's not supposed
to have too nice of clothes

12:10.080 --> 12:11.840
any more than she's supposed
to be in AP calculus, right?

12:12.040 --> 12:13.380
MORALES:
Okay, sir,

12:13.580 --> 12:15.850
no one is saying that
and no one is thinking that.

12:16.050 --> 12:16.850
We came in here
voluntarily to talk about

12:17.050 --> 12:17.850
a car
that was stolen,

12:18.050 --> 12:18.950
and you want to ask

12:19.150 --> 12:20.290
our daughter trick questions

12:20.490 --> 12:21.890
like she's a suspect?
No more voluntarily.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.320
And we want a lawyer.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.620
And unless you're placing
our daughter under arrest,

12:24.820 --> 12:26.370
we're also entitled to go home.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.240
Goody.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.880
OFFICER:
I left that folder on your desk.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.730
I got it.
Thank you.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.780
So, what do you got?

12:49.980 --> 12:51.380
Well, you said
you wanted a heads-up

12:51.580 --> 12:53.720
about how things are going
so that's what I'm here for.

12:53.920 --> 12:54.920
Landlord jacked up

12:55.120 --> 12:56.620
our rent 3,700 a month,

12:56.820 --> 12:57.720
a beer truck driver's

12:57.920 --> 12:58.760
putting in a claim for falling

12:58.960 --> 12:59.890
on the basement stairs.

13:00.090 --> 13:01.160
Corinne feels like

13:01.360 --> 13:02.730
she has no choice
but to go to her father.

13:02.930 --> 13:04.430
I don't want her
to go to her father.

13:04.630 --> 13:06.770
I don't know that you
have anything to say about it.

13:06.970 --> 13:09.100
Um... (clears throat)

13:09.300 --> 13:10.570
Is she, um,

13:10.770 --> 13:12.600
she going out with anybody else?

13:12.800 --> 13:13.910
Don't ask me that, Killian.

13:14.110 --> 13:15.070
I'm not gonna
do anything about it,

13:15.270 --> 13:16.710
I just... I just want to know.

13:16.910 --> 13:18.130
Then find out yourself.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.830
(whispering):
Find out myself.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.500
HAYWOOD:
You know where
this is at?

13:28.540 --> 13:29.590
That's Snowball's block.

13:29.790 --> 13:30.620
There's a bunch of young girls

13:30.820 --> 13:32.060
hang out on the stoop there.

13:32.260 --> 13:33.890
You want some
Extended Tour overtime?
Yeah.

13:34.090 --> 13:35.590
Her name's Bianca Wilson.

13:35.790 --> 13:37.400
See who she's been
hanging around with.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.600
Okay.
All right.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.870
All right,
you got it.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.800
I'd rather you not
go on this one, Marvin.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.270
Bentley's less likely

13:43.470 --> 13:46.520
to get made as a cop
if you're not with him.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.780
You're sending him
off by himself?

13:50.980 --> 13:52.740
Well, uh, he can
go with Quinlan.

13:52.950 --> 13:54.380
Yeah.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.380
Same generation.

13:56.580 --> 13:58.130
Okay?

13:59.830 --> 14:01.050
Yeah, yeah.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.020
All right.
Thanks, Marvin.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.660
* Don't need no golden hour,
I stay lit *

14:05.860 --> 14:06.960
* New day, new flex *

14:07.160 --> 14:08.260
* Don't edit my ... *

14:08.460 --> 14:10.730
* I don't need to be modest *

14:10.930 --> 14:12.130
* Don't do no look back *

14:12.330 --> 14:14.670
* Got those diamonds
that reflect. *

14:14.870 --> 14:16.100
You know,

14:16.300 --> 14:18.470
I'm kind of glad
we got to do this together.

14:18.670 --> 14:20.410
Why's that?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.610
(laughs) Come on.

14:22.810 --> 14:24.490
What do you mean,
"Why's that?"

14:25.390 --> 14:27.360
'Cause I like being
around you, that's why.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.000
I like being with you, too.

14:35.270 --> 14:36.550
I don't know.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.860
I don't feel
like I'm living

14:39.060 --> 14:42.260
my normal life for
some reason, you know?

14:42.460 --> 14:44.060
Is it possible it's
'cause your mother's here?

14:44.260 --> 14:45.060
Yeah.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.360
Yeah,

14:46.560 --> 14:47.730
definitely possible.

14:47.930 --> 14:48.870
Well, for what
it's worth,

14:49.070 --> 14:50.300
she seems
pretty together

14:50.500 --> 14:52.770
from what
I can tell.
You can't tell.

14:52.970 --> 14:54.320
That's the problem.

14:56.290 --> 14:58.160
How long's
she staying?

14:59.390 --> 15:01.060
No idea.

15:02.230 --> 15:05.000
(door opens)
Oh, there's Bianca.

15:05.970 --> 15:06.990
(camera shutter clicking)

15:07.190 --> 15:10.570
(indistinct chatter)

15:11.610 --> 15:12.940
Oh...

15:15.640 --> 15:18.010
Oh, that's Georgia and Tanya.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.700
(car chirps)
You know them?

15:20.900 --> 15:22.170
BENTLEY:
Yeah.

15:22.370 --> 15:24.170
They're in the track club
Haywood and I

15:24.370 --> 15:25.890
have been
helping out with.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.310
Hi, Chris.

15:36.510 --> 15:39.550
I got a friend following me.
Will you let him up?

15:39.750 --> 15:41.220
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.

15:41.420 --> 15:42.870
Of course.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.150
(elevator dings)

16:00.160 --> 16:02.590
(tap shoes clicking)

16:08.760 --> 16:10.930
(clears throat)

16:12.030 --> 16:14.490
(whispering):
Hey. Hey.

16:14.690 --> 16:16.490
Hey. There he is.

16:16.690 --> 16:18.520
Um, I didn't know if I was
supposed to wait outside.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.790
Why would you wait outside?

16:19.990 --> 16:20.790
We can talk right there.

16:20.990 --> 16:22.860
Okay. So we can talk here?

16:23.060 --> 16:24.300
Yeah.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.600
I was just
auditioning these actors

16:25.800 --> 16:27.470
for a musical I'm investing in,

16:27.670 --> 16:30.800
keep my wife...
my ex-wife off my back.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.110
Well, I guess you
got to love theater.

16:33.310 --> 16:35.270
I hate theater.

16:35.470 --> 16:36.470
So, what are you
here to tell me?

16:36.670 --> 16:38.430
Um...

16:39.290 --> 16:41.750
The offer you made
the other night

16:41.950 --> 16:43.880
to have me do
security for you?

16:44.080 --> 16:46.420
Um, truth is, I could
use some extra cash,

16:46.620 --> 16:47.690
but I got to know,

16:47.890 --> 16:49.920
um, I'd still be
keeping my day job, right?

16:50.120 --> 16:52.270
You keep as many jobs
as you want.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.890
Well, in that case, I...

16:55.090 --> 16:56.660
I'd like to accept your offer.

16:56.860 --> 16:57.660
Fantastic.

16:57.860 --> 16:59.260
Your passport up to date?

16:59.460 --> 17:02.450
Um, I'm not even sure
where my passport is.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.800
Ah, don't worry about it.
I'll have my office

17:05.000 --> 17:06.140
make sure they
issue you a new one.

17:06.340 --> 17:08.810
(chuckles) What,
am I going somewhere?

17:09.010 --> 17:11.290
Yeah, I'm buying
a racehorse in Dubai.

17:12.390 --> 17:14.100
You're free this weekend, right?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.230
Yeah.

17:25.070 --> 17:26.490
ANN-MARIE:
Oh, there she is.

17:26.690 --> 17:28.310
Hey.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.360
Hey, babe.

17:31.560 --> 17:32.750
Hi.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.970
Brandy, this is Duke.
Duke, my daughter Brandy.

17:36.170 --> 17:38.000
Hi.
How you doing, Brandy?

17:38.200 --> 17:39.700
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.340
I got a phone call to meet you
here. Is everything all right?

17:41.540 --> 17:43.330
Everything's great. Sit down.

17:44.530 --> 17:47.050
So, Duke has a vacant condo

17:47.250 --> 17:48.780
in Mill Basin that
he said I could use.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.950
It's just sitting
there empty.

17:51.150 --> 17:53.950
Oh... I didn't realize you were
sticking around that long.

17:54.150 --> 17:56.190
I didn't think that I was,
but you know,

17:56.390 --> 17:58.420
when I shared at
the meeting last night

17:58.620 --> 18:01.460
how I spent my whole
life running away,

18:01.660 --> 18:02.860
it occurred to me
that maybe it was time

18:03.060 --> 18:04.660
to stop running.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.360
Right? Yeah.
Hundred percent.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.770
That affected me
deeply what she shared.

18:08.970 --> 18:09.930
I seldom share,

18:10.130 --> 18:11.170
but after she shared
what she shared,

18:11.370 --> 18:13.440
I shared that I feel worthless.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.740
(laughs)

18:14.940 --> 18:16.310
On what planet could you
be considered worthless?

18:16.510 --> 18:18.210
He supports you know
how many people?

18:18.410 --> 18:20.080
Oh, stop it.
Dah, dah, dah, dah.
Oh.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.610
So you're gonna

18:21.810 --> 18:23.010
move into the condo?

18:23.220 --> 18:24.080
She's more than welcome.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.020
I mean, I'd like to think

18:26.220 --> 18:27.320
I could help you get through

18:27.520 --> 18:28.470
whatever it is
you're going through.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.390
And Duke said he could use
some help at the dealership.

18:32.590 --> 18:34.190
Dealership? Uh,
what kind of dealership?

18:34.390 --> 18:36.790
Maserati.
(phone rings)

18:36.990 --> 18:37.830
Well, if you'll
excuse me a minute,

18:38.030 --> 18:40.220
I got to take this.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.000
Sweetheart,
you know,

18:44.200 --> 18:45.300
sometimes when
you meet somebody,

18:45.500 --> 18:48.140
there's like this
instantaneous connection.

18:48.340 --> 18:50.010
And I-I wasn't
looking for it,

18:50.210 --> 18:51.840
and Duke
wasn't looking for it,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.430
but... it was there.

18:55.630 --> 18:56.680
Wow.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.950
You watch. You know,
if you're open to it,

18:59.150 --> 19:00.750
the same thing
could happen for you.

19:00.950 --> 19:01.990
SERVER:
There you are.

19:02.190 --> 19:03.540
Thanks.

19:04.370 --> 19:05.890
* My problem *

19:06.090 --> 19:08.540
* Better pay attention
who you talking to *

19:09.510 --> 19:11.930
* Show me some respect
when I walk in the room *

19:12.130 --> 19:15.500
* 'Cause you wish you were me,
yeah, babe, I know you do *

19:15.700 --> 19:18.100
* But I don't have no patience
for that attitude *

19:18.300 --> 19:19.470
* Thankful for my mama... *

19:19.670 --> 19:21.010
What's up, Coach?

19:21.210 --> 19:22.540
You got a minute?

19:22.740 --> 19:24.140
Anytime for you.

19:24.340 --> 19:26.380
I want to talk to you
about Bianca Wilson.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.210
I don't know nothing
about Bianca.

19:28.410 --> 19:31.750
If you're involved in certain
illegal activities,

19:31.950 --> 19:33.520
I just want to
help you

19:33.720 --> 19:34.950
get uninvolved.

19:35.150 --> 19:38.160
You worried about me and
my friendship with Georgia,

19:38.360 --> 19:40.360
me killing her chance
of getting a scholarship?

19:40.560 --> 19:43.130
I'm just talking
about you right now.

19:43.330 --> 19:44.930
You ain't never
talking about me.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.200
The only reason why you care

19:46.400 --> 19:47.130
is 'cause I'm tight
with Georgia.

19:47.330 --> 19:48.600
We have reason to believe

19:48.800 --> 19:51.870
Bianca may be involved
in robberies, Tanya.

19:52.070 --> 19:53.670
So arrest her.

19:53.870 --> 19:56.390
And if you think I'm
involved, arrest me, too.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.450
I don't want to have to do that.

20:00.650 --> 20:02.410
So what, you giving me
a chance of saving myself

20:02.610 --> 20:05.120
by ratting out on Bianca?

20:05.320 --> 20:06.550
Nah, I ain't interested.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.350
It's not going to
end well for Bianca,

20:08.550 --> 20:10.490
and it may not end well
for anyone in her crew.

20:10.690 --> 20:11.790
You know,
it's funny,

20:11.990 --> 20:13.830
at the track you said
to look at you

20:14.030 --> 20:15.630
like a mentor, not a cop.

20:15.830 --> 20:19.160
You said that you had
dreams of running track,

20:19.360 --> 20:20.930
that you had dreams
of going places,

20:21.130 --> 20:22.870
to open up doors for us.

20:23.070 --> 20:24.170
I meant that.

20:24.370 --> 20:25.970
I don't need you
to open up nothing.

20:26.170 --> 20:27.590
Yo...

20:39.970 --> 20:42.750
* *

20:42.950 --> 20:44.520
ANN-MARIE: <i>Hey.</i>
QUINLAN: <i>Hey.</i>

20:44.720 --> 20:46.790
I got you some things at C-Town

20:46.990 --> 20:49.090
so you don't always have
to be going out to eat,

20:49.290 --> 20:51.000
including,

20:51.200 --> 20:52.330
my darling daughter,

20:52.530 --> 20:53.630
Vienna Fingers,

20:53.830 --> 20:55.980
'cause I know how much
you love them.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.810
So, did you spend the night
at that guy's place last night?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.470
Well, not
at his place.

21:02.670 --> 21:05.280
I stayed at the condo
that he said I could use,

21:05.480 --> 21:06.740
which, by the way,

21:06.940 --> 21:08.150
is gorgeous.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.780
And this is all part of AA?

21:09.980 --> 21:13.290
Yeah, one addict
or alcoholic helping another

21:13.490 --> 21:15.150
is very much
part of AA.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.570
And then moving in for the kill?

21:18.670 --> 21:19.990
That's not what I'm doing.

21:20.190 --> 21:22.030
Come on, Ma, that's
exactly what you're doing.

21:22.230 --> 21:23.030
That's what you always do.

21:23.230 --> 21:24.460
You find a guy,

21:24.660 --> 21:26.400
he falls in love
with you,

21:26.600 --> 21:27.470
and then you use him
for all he's got

21:27.670 --> 21:28.670
for as long as he'll give it,

21:28.870 --> 21:30.170
and then when he
turns off the tap,

21:30.370 --> 21:30.940
you move on and move on
to the next guy.

21:31.140 --> 21:32.670
You know,

21:32.870 --> 21:34.840
I think we both
have had relationships

21:35.040 --> 21:36.360
that fit that description.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.560
Well, I did learn
from the master.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.710
I just want you to have
a decent life, Brandy, okay?

21:41.910 --> 21:43.920
This is something else
you have to make amends for?

21:44.120 --> 21:46.080
Yeah, to anyone I may have hurt.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.750
Yeah, well, I'd pack
a lunch for that to-do list.

21:49.950 --> 21:50.920
(sighs)

21:51.120 --> 21:53.060
You know, high on that list

21:53.260 --> 21:54.430
is that I didn't support you.

21:54.630 --> 21:56.530
It's all right, Ma.
No, no.

21:56.730 --> 21:58.000
It's not all right.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.730
You know, when you were
in junior high school

21:59.930 --> 22:01.100
and you wanted
to go out for band

22:01.300 --> 22:02.570
and you wanted to
play the trumpet,

22:02.770 --> 22:04.570
I told you that girls
don't play trumpet.

22:04.770 --> 22:06.470
It's really okay.
I-I got over it.

22:06.670 --> 22:07.910
What is it you want
from your life, Brandy?

22:08.110 --> 22:10.480
I mean, living here
in the housing projects,

22:10.680 --> 22:12.510
I'm assuming that's like
a temporary situation?

22:12.710 --> 22:14.450
Not for the people
that live here.

22:14.650 --> 22:16.210
Okay, well, it is for you.

22:16.410 --> 22:17.550
What is it that you want?

22:17.750 --> 22:19.180
I want to be a detective.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.320
All right.

22:21.520 --> 22:22.850
I moved in here
so that they could see

22:23.050 --> 22:25.790
that I have the people skills,
the intelligence...

22:25.990 --> 22:27.810
But I-I thought that takes
a long time, I mean, doesn't it?

22:28.840 --> 22:31.580
It takes as long
as it takes, Ma.

22:32.750 --> 22:35.020
I-I just don't want you
to be disappointed.

22:38.950 --> 22:40.940
You know what,
I got to go to work.

22:41.140 --> 22:43.680
Want me to make you a sandwich?
I got nice tuna.

22:43.880 --> 22:44.780
I'm good.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.740
All right, well, call me later.

22:46.940 --> 22:48.780
All right, I'll
talk to you soon.

22:48.980 --> 22:50.700
Bye.
Bye.

22:57.140 --> 22:59.370
(piano music playing)

23:04.510 --> 23:06.530
AZEROFF:
Hey, here you are.

23:06.730 --> 23:08.630
Oh, here's your,
uh, your passport.

23:08.830 --> 23:12.200
Um, yeah, listen,
about that, Mr. Azeroff.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.670
Um, I-I don't...
I don't think I can, uh,

23:15.870 --> 23:17.140
accompany you to
Dubai this weekend.

23:17.340 --> 23:18.410
I mean,
I wish I could.

23:18.610 --> 23:19.940
God knows
I need the money,

23:20.140 --> 23:21.350
but, um, uh,

23:21.550 --> 23:23.350
it's just I don't have
a lot of flexibility

23:23.550 --> 23:26.080
as far as days off
go, and, um,

23:26.280 --> 23:27.990
it might be that you're
looking for someone

23:28.190 --> 23:31.710
who's retired off the job
rather than active duty.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.590
Thank you, but
I-I can't take this.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.700
What am I going
to do with it?

23:37.900 --> 23:39.380
(laughs)

23:41.080 --> 23:42.230
Right, of course.

23:42.430 --> 23:46.090
This one, she wants
to be an FBI agent.

23:47.590 --> 23:48.710
Think you can
help her out?

23:48.910 --> 23:50.610
Come on, he doesn't
even know me.

23:50.810 --> 23:54.060
We met at the World
Economic Forum in Davos.

23:55.330 --> 23:57.180
Now, you've worked with
the FBI before, right?

23:57.380 --> 23:59.450
Uh, yeah, yeah, a few times.

23:59.650 --> 24:02.740
So, maybe you could
introduce her to somebody.

24:03.570 --> 24:04.960
Yeah, no, I can, um,

24:05.160 --> 24:06.490
maybe look through my files,
you know,

24:06.690 --> 24:08.480
and see if I can find a name.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.390
Done.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.030
Thank you.
You bet.

24:12.230 --> 24:13.970
Yeah, so, anyway,

24:14.170 --> 24:15.970
I'm-I'm sorry about
the Dubai thing, you know.

24:16.170 --> 24:17.400
I mean, I should've told
you it might be a problem.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.540
How much will it take?

24:18.740 --> 24:20.400
I'm not due to get paid.

24:20.610 --> 24:22.410
There's roughly...

24:22.610 --> 24:23.790
10,000 here.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.090
That do it?

24:27.090 --> 24:28.280
Just like that?

24:28.480 --> 24:29.960
Just like that.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.670
(tablet chimes)

24:45.510 --> 24:47.330
SUAREZ:
Hey.

24:47.530 --> 24:48.470
Hi.

24:48.670 --> 24:50.970
What time do you
usually start in?

24:51.170 --> 24:53.720
I'm usually up and
humming at about 5:00.

24:55.190 --> 24:56.740
Well,

24:56.940 --> 24:59.840
I'm guessing since you're not
working with Raymond anymore,

25:00.040 --> 25:01.080
uh, you might

25:01.280 --> 25:03.110
have some extra
time on your hands.

25:03.310 --> 25:05.130
(laughs)
No?

25:06.100 --> 25:08.250
Since he fired me,

25:08.450 --> 25:10.720
I've taken on
a congressman

25:10.920 --> 25:12.560
considering a run for Senate,

25:12.760 --> 25:14.590
a mayor considering
a run for governor

25:14.790 --> 25:16.660
and a presidential

25:16.860 --> 25:19.730
candidate in the Czech Republic.

25:19.930 --> 25:21.230
Wow.

25:21.430 --> 25:23.570
And Raymond's called me
four times in the last week.

25:23.770 --> 25:25.540
That's what happens
when you make yourself

25:25.740 --> 25:27.590
indispensable.

25:30.390 --> 25:32.040
Just say the word

25:32.240 --> 25:34.750
and I will make
you indispensable.

25:34.950 --> 25:35.930
Mmm.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.220
You have something
on your mind?

25:43.420 --> 25:45.390
What if...

25:45.590 --> 25:49.080
I get approval
from the press office?

25:50.410 --> 25:53.550
Would you be open to
doing some interviews?

25:54.520 --> 25:56.370
Assuming...

25:56.570 --> 25:58.170
a higher profile?

25:58.370 --> 25:59.800
(chuckles)

26:00.000 --> 26:01.610
Um...

26:01.810 --> 26:06.130
Higher profile as in,
um, career advancement?

26:07.490 --> 26:11.700
Yes, yes.
Career advancement.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.020
Yeah, I'd...

26:16.220 --> 26:17.840
I'd be open to that.

26:21.610 --> 26:22.730
What are you
doing here, Georgia?

26:22.930 --> 26:24.700
Tanya told me you
were pressuring her

26:24.900 --> 26:26.200
to give up some robbery crew.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.030
I thought she might
not want to spend

26:28.230 --> 26:29.670
the next ten years
of her life in prison.

26:29.870 --> 26:31.900
Tanya's the most loyal
person who ever lived.

26:32.100 --> 26:34.770
She hangs with Bianca because
Bianca tried to recruit me.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.240
I assume you turned Bianca down.
Why couldn't Tanya?

26:37.440 --> 26:38.640
It's been a while

26:38.840 --> 26:40.240
since you've been
in high school, Ms. Haywood.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.480
There's a price to pay

26:41.680 --> 26:42.850
if you say no to Bianca.

26:43.050 --> 26:44.380
And what your friend
is going to find out

26:44.580 --> 26:46.820
is that there's a price
to pay if you say yes.

26:47.020 --> 26:48.620
And I'm done
having Tanya pay it.

26:48.820 --> 26:50.590
I convinced Bianca

26:50.790 --> 26:51.960
I was down with
robbing one of those stores,

26:52.160 --> 26:53.520
and she said the next
time they hit one,

26:53.730 --> 26:54.760
I could come with them.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.060
Looks like that's today.

26:56.260 --> 26:57.830
Georgia...

26:58.030 --> 27:00.670
that is not what
you should be doing.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.270
It ain't what Tanya
should be doing neither,

27:02.470 --> 27:04.140
but you didn't have
a problem asking her.

27:04.340 --> 27:05.650
I thought she was
already doing it.

27:06.450 --> 27:09.790
The fact is you both
put yourselves at risk.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.430
What was it you asked Tanya for?

27:13.230 --> 27:15.710
I asked her to help us
build a case against Bianca.

27:15.910 --> 27:18.070
So, now that's
what I'm gonna do.

27:25.740 --> 27:27.590
HAYWOOD:
We'll be following from
a distance and monitoring

27:27.790 --> 27:31.180
any conversations taking place
between you and the other girls.

27:32.410 --> 27:33.770
We'll also be
monitoring your location.

27:33.970 --> 27:35.770
If we hear
anything funny,

27:35.970 --> 27:37.570
we'll be right there.

27:37.770 --> 27:39.150
Let's do it.

27:40.050 --> 27:42.890
You are one brave
young woman, Georgia.

27:43.660 --> 27:44.510
(knock on door)

27:44.710 --> 27:46.140
Inspector?
Yes?

27:46.340 --> 27:47.240
I need you.

27:47.440 --> 27:48.410
Okay.

27:48.610 --> 27:50.200
I'll be right back, okay?

27:52.970 --> 27:54.920
These are the parents
of the Wilson girl

27:55.120 --> 27:57.450
you like for the robbery.
(quiet chatter)

27:57.650 --> 27:59.990
What can I do for you folks?

28:00.190 --> 28:01.290
We're worried about
our daughter.

28:01.490 --> 28:02.660
What are you worried about?

28:02.860 --> 28:03.760
You don't
want to think

28:03.960 --> 28:04.900
your kid's mixed up
in anything.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.300
And we don't know
that she is.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.300
What is it
you think

28:07.500 --> 28:09.130
she might be mixed up in?

28:09.330 --> 28:10.570
We don't always know
where Bianca is.

28:10.770 --> 28:11.870
We don't want her to get hurt.

28:12.070 --> 28:13.770
I'm curious about
what caused you

28:13.970 --> 28:15.890
to come in and tell me that.

28:16.990 --> 28:18.310
My husband kept
a gun on a shelf

28:18.510 --> 28:19.480
in our bedroom closet.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.310
Bianca knew that's
where he kept it.

28:21.510 --> 28:23.300
It's gone.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.260
All right, they're
at Belmont and Schenck.

28:36.460 --> 28:37.930
Make sure you don't
get close enough

28:38.130 --> 28:39.300
to get made.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.230
I don't want to put
Georgia at any more risk

28:40.430 --> 28:41.600
than she's already in.

28:41.800 --> 28:42.630
BIANCA (over wire):
Why you ain't never

28:42.830 --> 28:43.770
hang out with us until now?

28:43.970 --> 28:45.040
GEORGIA:
Between school and track,

28:45.240 --> 28:46.270
I ain't got time

28:46.470 --> 28:48.310
to hang out with anyone.

28:48.510 --> 28:50.940
BIANCA:
Probably that ain't the only
reason though, right?

28:51.140 --> 28:52.480
I don't like where
this conversation's going.

28:52.680 --> 28:53.680
BIANCA:
Come with us.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.060
GEORGIA:
Where are we?

29:07.540 --> 29:08.730
Tanya told us you
were gonna be famous.

29:08.930 --> 29:11.430
(scoffs) I-I don't
know about all that.

29:11.630 --> 29:13.460
Didn't she say that?
Uh-huh.

29:13.660 --> 29:15.770
She said you could be
like Sha'Carri Richardson.

29:15.970 --> 29:18.990
Bianca, I'm a long way
from Sha'Carri Richardson.

29:19.990 --> 29:22.060
Come here.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.990
I want to show
you something.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.930
Give me your hand.

29:46.010 --> 29:48.480
(latches clicking)

29:53.820 --> 29:54.710
This...

29:54.910 --> 29:56.310
is a Patek.

29:56.510 --> 29:58.110
A lot of rappers

29:58.310 --> 29:59.730
wear Pateks.

30:01.260 --> 30:02.780
Oh, yeah?

30:02.980 --> 30:04.500
You're gonna wear one
next race you run.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.020
Great.

30:07.220 --> 30:08.150
And tonight,

30:08.350 --> 30:10.790
we're gonna get one for me.

30:10.990 --> 30:12.540
Okay.

30:13.810 --> 30:15.780
Go get her one of those
coats we wear.

30:27.820 --> 30:29.110
Yeah, you're right.

30:29.310 --> 30:31.680
My jacket's no good for this.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.410
The coat you want me
to wear is much better.

30:34.610 --> 30:36.980
That's her trying to tell us
we're about to lose contact.

30:37.180 --> 30:40.050
Bianca has a gun, so we need to
find another way to track them.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.440
KILLIAN:
Any ideas, boss?

30:42.270 --> 30:43.970
HAYWOOD:
Yeah, maybe.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.880
Perfect.

30:58.950 --> 31:00.240
WOMAN:
<i>I appreciate you taking the time</i>

31:00.440 --> 31:02.240
to talk to me, Chief.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.670
Well, as long as
the interview requests

31:03.870 --> 31:06.710
are approved by the DCPI,
I'm happy to do it, Nadia.

31:06.910 --> 31:08.480
What's your response
to the claims

31:08.680 --> 31:10.250
that the uptick
in street crime

31:10.450 --> 31:11.880
is directly
attributable

31:12.080 --> 31:13.180
to bail reform

31:13.380 --> 31:15.150
and a lack of effort
on the part of the cops?

31:15.350 --> 31:17.350
I would question the
premise that there has been

31:17.550 --> 31:19.090
an uptick in street crime,

31:19.290 --> 31:21.390
and I definitely would
challenge the premise

31:21.590 --> 31:24.300
that there's been
a lack of effort

31:24.500 --> 31:25.530
on the part of the cops.

31:25.730 --> 31:26.800
From my understanding,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
the uptick has
not been city-wide.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.840
Exactly, that's right.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.800
In fact, from the most
recent statistics,

31:34.010 --> 31:36.310
some sections of
the city have seen

31:36.510 --> 31:37.980
a marked downturn
in street crime.

31:38.180 --> 31:40.640
And I think that one factor
that corresponds to that

31:40.840 --> 31:42.350
is the increase in foot patrols.

31:42.550 --> 31:44.520
I understand you have
something to do with that.

31:44.720 --> 31:45.980
Actually, the credit for that

31:46.180 --> 31:47.780
belongs to our precinct
commander at the 7-4,

31:47.990 --> 31:50.050
Deputy Inspector Regina Haywood.

31:50.250 --> 31:51.520
This was her idea.

31:51.720 --> 31:52.990
You were behind it though.

31:53.190 --> 31:57.240
Foot patrols?
I was behind that 100%.

31:59.010 --> 32:00.100
I'm happy
not to do this

32:00.300 --> 32:01.630
in front of your
grandmother, Tanya,

32:01.830 --> 32:03.430
but we can't waste
any time right now.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.140
Why even bother me at all?

32:05.340 --> 32:06.570
You're a material
witness.

32:06.770 --> 32:08.440
What that mean?

32:08.640 --> 32:11.010
We have reason to believe
you have information

32:11.210 --> 32:13.440
pertinent to an
ongoing investigation,

32:13.640 --> 32:14.880
which means
we can detain you.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.810
That's stuff I hear from
Ice-T on <i>Law & Order.</i>

32:17.010 --> 32:19.820
I ain't buying it then,
I ain't buying it now.

32:20.020 --> 32:22.050
Tanya. Your
friend Georgia's

32:22.250 --> 32:23.150
in trouble.

32:23.350 --> 32:24.790
She agreed to go with Bianca

32:24.990 --> 32:26.320
and the other girls
on a robbery,

32:26.520 --> 32:28.260
and Bianca
has a gun.

32:28.460 --> 32:29.530
Hey, if you help me,

32:29.730 --> 32:31.550
I'd like to
save the both of you.

32:34.650 --> 32:36.200
Doing this
for Georgia,

32:36.400 --> 32:38.190
I'm not doing this for you.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.860
I got Bianca on Find-A-Friend.

32:43.620 --> 32:44.910
YENKO:
You mind if I take it?
Sure.

32:45.110 --> 32:47.480
YENKO:
She's on Atlantic
heading toward the BQE.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.260
I'll coordinate with Highway.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.920
BIANCA:
<i>Who's got the hammer?</i>

33:01.130 --> 33:02.460
I got it.

33:02.660 --> 33:03.690
Okay, remember,
the case with the Pateks

33:03.890 --> 33:05.960
is against
the wall on the right.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.560
Wait, my right or your right?

33:07.760 --> 33:09.470
Facing the store.

33:09.670 --> 33:12.150
It's against
the right side, Whitney.

33:14.720 --> 33:18.330
(sirens wailing)

33:19.430 --> 33:21.300
(tires screech)

33:22.430 --> 33:24.820
OFFICER: This is the NYPD.
Turn the vehicle off

33:25.020 --> 33:27.550
and put your hands
where we can see them.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.990
I repeat: turn the vehicle off

33:30.190 --> 33:32.640
and put your hands
where we can see them.

33:36.880 --> 33:37.860
GEORGIA:
Oh, my God, Bianca.

33:38.060 --> 33:39.130
OFFICER:
Gun, gun, gun!

33:39.330 --> 33:41.370
Somebody say something
to the cops?

33:41.570 --> 33:43.500
Bianca, nobody
said nothing.

33:43.700 --> 33:46.100
OFFICER:
Put the weapon down now!

33:46.300 --> 33:48.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Whoa.

33:48.210 --> 33:49.810
What about you, track star?

33:50.010 --> 33:52.380
You asked me along 'cause you
knew I wouldn't say nothing.

33:52.580 --> 33:54.410
Hold on, hold on. Bianca,

33:54.610 --> 33:55.850
put the gun down.

33:56.050 --> 33:57.510
This when you tell me I'm
not in trouble as of yet?

33:57.710 --> 33:59.780
No, this is when I tell you

33:59.980 --> 34:02.590
that if anyone gets hurt,

34:02.790 --> 34:05.560
you're gonna be in
a lot more trouble.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.820
I never laid hands on nobody.

34:08.020 --> 34:10.090
That's good.
That counts for a lot.

34:10.290 --> 34:11.350
Put the gun down.

34:12.950 --> 34:14.400
You're a young girl,

34:14.600 --> 34:16.030
and sometimes

34:16.230 --> 34:18.170
young girls,
they do foolish things.

34:18.370 --> 34:22.240
People look at you different
when you wearing Balenciaga

34:22.440 --> 34:23.440
and Alexander McQueen.

34:23.640 --> 34:25.790
HAYWOOD:
Bianca, look at me. I know.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.480
You put
the gun down now,

34:29.680 --> 34:30.650
you will go to juvie,

34:30.850 --> 34:32.720
but, Bianca,

34:32.920 --> 34:34.290
chances are,
inside of a year,

34:34.490 --> 34:37.240
you are going to be back
at home with your parents.

34:38.110 --> 34:41.010
That's real talk.
I'm telling you now.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.930
(gun clicks)

34:44.130 --> 34:45.880
(panting)

34:51.690 --> 34:53.670
Bianca, I want you
to listen to me.

34:53.870 --> 34:54.870
When I open this door,

34:55.070 --> 34:57.510
I want you to come
outside of the car,

34:57.710 --> 35:00.010
I want you to put your hands up.

35:00.210 --> 35:02.010
I want you to turn around,
face the vehicle

35:02.210 --> 35:04.970
and put your hands on the
vehicle, do you understand me?

35:06.830 --> 35:08.420
Okay.

35:08.620 --> 35:11.620
OFFICER:
Get out of the car very
slowly with your hands up.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.490
Hands where
I can see them.

35:13.690 --> 35:15.030
Put your hands
where I can see them.
Get out the car!

35:15.230 --> 35:16.330
Keep your hands where
I can see them.

35:16.530 --> 35:17.530
Put them up there.

35:17.730 --> 35:19.180
Let's go.
Back of the car.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.020
(handcuffs clicking)

35:31.930 --> 35:33.480
GEORGIA:
<i>You get what you need?</i>

35:33.680 --> 35:34.950
I think so.

35:35.150 --> 35:36.150
The storage unit
had all kinds

35:36.350 --> 35:37.610
of stolen
merchandise in it

35:37.810 --> 35:39.750
and it's registered to Bianca.

35:39.950 --> 35:41.820
What about Tanya?

35:42.020 --> 35:44.410
We can't tie Tanya
to the robberies.

35:45.670 --> 35:47.390
So, she should be all right.

35:47.590 --> 35:49.090
She keeps telling me I should
start running track again.

35:49.290 --> 35:51.510
Why do you think she says that?

35:52.580 --> 35:54.930
Probably 'cause she knows me.

35:55.130 --> 35:57.480
She knows you
and she cares about you.

36:00.090 --> 36:01.960
Whenever
you're ready.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.980
I don't know that I am.

36:06.180 --> 36:08.060
Whenever it is
that you are.

36:10.030 --> 36:12.430
Okay.
Okay.

36:19.910 --> 36:21.460
(indistinct chatter)

36:21.660 --> 36:22.530
(horn honks)

36:22.730 --> 36:24.250
Hey.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.030
Hi.

36:27.230 --> 36:28.700
(engine revs)
Hey.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.170
(music playing
over stereo stops)

36:30.370 --> 36:32.170
You said you were
patrolling New Lots Avenue,

36:32.370 --> 36:34.270
so I thought I'd come
and try to find you.

36:34.470 --> 36:36.470
Nice car.
Right?

36:36.670 --> 36:37.810
Um, hey,
why don't I just

36:38.010 --> 36:39.280
meet you down
on the corner?
Yeah.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.680
Duke asked me
to drop it off.

36:41.880 --> 36:42.950
Drop it off where?

36:43.150 --> 36:44.220
Uh, the people that bought it.

36:44.420 --> 36:45.850
They live in New Jersey.
Basking Ridge?

36:46.050 --> 36:48.590
Okay, and how are you
supposed to get back?

36:48.790 --> 36:49.650
Oh, Duke's meeting me there.

36:49.850 --> 36:51.020
We're gonna go see Chris Rock

36:51.220 --> 36:52.760
at the Borgata in Atlantic City.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.160
Isn't that great?

36:54.360 --> 36:55.860
Yeah, that's real great, Ma.
Have a good time.

36:56.060 --> 36:57.130
Hey, hey.

36:57.330 --> 36:58.700
What kind of send-off is that?

36:58.900 --> 36:59.700
I didn't realize
I was supposed to be

36:59.900 --> 37:00.930
giving you a send-off.

37:01.130 --> 37:03.070
I didn't know that
this was the beginning

37:03.270 --> 37:05.340
of your next
Hustler's World Tour.

37:05.540 --> 37:07.600
(scoffs) What is it, Brandy?
Huh? What's the problem?

37:07.800 --> 37:08.870
Respectable woman

37:09.070 --> 37:10.570
is not supposed to accept
favors from men?

37:10.770 --> 37:12.310
That's completely irrelevant.

37:12.510 --> 37:16.480
"Hey, Ma, have a great time.
Chris Rock's hilarious."

37:16.680 --> 37:18.250
Pop the trunk.

37:18.450 --> 37:19.880
What, is this
a traffic stop now?

37:20.080 --> 37:21.490
Yeah, call it whatever
you want. Pop the trunk.

37:21.690 --> 37:23.190
I don't even know
what button it is.

37:23.390 --> 37:24.390
Figure it out, Mom. Pop it.

37:24.590 --> 37:26.170
(trunk pops)

37:33.350 --> 37:34.870
What you think you're gonna
find in there, Brandy, huh?

37:35.070 --> 37:38.250
I don't know, Ma.
That's why I was looking.

37:43.690 --> 37:44.580
(engine starts)

37:44.780 --> 37:47.330
(music resumes over stereo)

37:54.540 --> 37:58.070
Hey, how about
I buy you a coffee?

37:59.470 --> 38:01.960
Good afternoon, Officers.
Quite a nice day today,

38:02.160 --> 38:03.260
isn't it?
Yep.

38:03.460 --> 38:05.250
Good afternoon.

38:07.150 --> 38:08.880
YENKO:
<i>It's hard to imagine being 17...</i>

38:10.150 --> 38:12.490
...and having the nerve
these girls had.

38:13.450 --> 38:14.770
Is it nerve or desperation?

38:14.970 --> 38:18.020
Well, I think the desperation
gives you the nerve.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.380
Turn it up.

38:22.580 --> 38:24.750
NADIA: ...from the most
recent statistics,

38:24.950 --> 38:26.680
some sections of
the city have seen

38:26.880 --> 38:28.520
a marked downturn
in street crime.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.090
And one factor, I think,

38:30.290 --> 38:31.820
Nadia, that corresponds to that

38:32.020 --> 38:33.060
is the increase in foot patrols.

38:33.260 --> 38:34.090
I understand you have

38:34.290 --> 38:35.330
something to do with that.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.330
I was behind that
a hundred percent.

38:37.530 --> 38:38.760
YENKO:
Whoa.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.430
NADIA: With ideas like that,
I suspect you'll be

38:40.630 --> 38:41.900
commissioner in no time.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.330
YENKO:
There are some people

38:43.530 --> 38:44.740
I would think would take credit

38:44.940 --> 38:46.140
for what somebody else did.

38:46.340 --> 38:47.470
I wouldn't expect it of him.
I'm surprised.

38:47.670 --> 38:50.320
Maybe it's time we
stopped being surprised.

38:58.830 --> 39:00.100
CORRINE:
Hey.

39:00.870 --> 39:02.370
KILLIAN:
Hey.

39:05.770 --> 39:06.820
Um,

39:07.020 --> 39:09.160
I heard you're having
money problems.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.410
Yeah, you could
say that.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.550
(clears throat)

39:16.920 --> 39:18.150
Here's $10,000.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.740
Where did you
get $10,000?

39:20.940 --> 39:22.110
It doesn't matter.

39:22.310 --> 39:24.040
Are you shaking down
drug dealers, Tommy?

39:24.240 --> 39:25.740
No, I'm...
Well, then what?

39:25.940 --> 39:28.010
'Cause I know you don't have
$10,000 lying around.

39:28.210 --> 39:30.250
It's an advance from
a guy I'm working for.

39:30.450 --> 39:31.620
What guy?

39:31.820 --> 39:32.880
You don't know him.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.650
He's a rich guy paying me
to do security.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.020
It's totally legal.

39:36.220 --> 39:37.250
Look, there's
a lot of cops

39:37.450 --> 39:38.990
who got something
going on the side.

39:39.190 --> 39:42.240
Yeah, do a lot of cops
get advanced $10,000?

39:44.810 --> 39:46.430
Are you... Are you just dead-set

39:46.630 --> 39:48.370
against me helping you out
for some reason?

39:48.570 --> 39:51.600
Okay, so we're not
a couple anymore.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.550
I mean, we're not partners.

39:54.490 --> 39:56.910
You know, just pretend that,
you know,

39:57.110 --> 39:58.410
we were sitting next
to each other on the bus,

39:58.610 --> 40:00.140
you know, and you
told me your story,

40:00.340 --> 40:02.180
and I'm helping you out
'cause I'm rich,

40:02.380 --> 40:03.750
and that's
what I do for kicks.

40:03.950 --> 40:05.600
That work?

40:10.570 --> 40:12.620
Corinne, hey,
it's not that big a deal.

40:12.820 --> 40:13.940
No.

40:14.740 --> 40:17.380
My dad went in for
his six-month checkup.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.010
His numbers were bad.

40:20.810 --> 40:22.180
I'm sorry.

40:23.150 --> 40:24.720
I just feel so alone, Tommy.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.660
No, you're not alone.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.440
It may feel that way,

40:33.640 --> 40:35.050
but...

40:35.250 --> 40:36.430
you're not.

40:37.830 --> 40:43.640
* Telling myself
that it's time to get out *

40:44.970 --> 40:48.040
* Fell off my bike again *

40:48.980 --> 40:51.060
* It's so embarrassing *

40:51.260 --> 40:55.680
* How much I want
to call you now. *
