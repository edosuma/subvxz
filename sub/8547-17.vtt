Yeah. I mean, you wouldn't let me
get it pierced,

03:51.054 --> 03:52.788
so I did it myself.

03:52.790 --> 03:53.852
Well, that was
really dangerous.

03:53.854 --> 03:54.891
You could have
hurt yourself.

03:54.893 --> 03:55.954
Yeah, I guess.

are so unreasonable.

05:02.501 --> 05:03.900

a manual for this kind of thing, right?

sure there's millions of books out there

05:09.047 --> 05:10.613
True. But I think
she's just rebelling

had the other night.

Oh, my goodness.

06:09.801 --> 06:12.065
Ok, so when I was pregnant, I wore
headphones on my belly

Henry hearing all this creepy stuff.

06:14.437 --> 06:16.244

06:36.379 --> 06:38.912
Madison P.D. found
the body of Mary Healy.

06:38.914 --> 06:41.977
3 nights ago, they discovered
Donna Rayburn.

06:41.979 --> 06:44.848
And this morning,
the body of Emma Ziko

06:44.850 --> 06:45.984
was discovered
by her friend.

06:45.986 --> 06:47.848
They were supposed to go
on a jog together.

06:47.850 --> 06:50.824
All 3 women had had
their wrists tied

06:50.826 --> 06:52.353
to the bed with scarves,

06:52.355 --> 06:54.161
and they were
sexually assaulted

06:54.163 --> 06:55.193
before they were strangled.

06:55.195 --> 06:56.258
Patterns on the neck
seem to be

06:56.260 --> 06:57.699
from a quarter inch
rope.

06:57.701 --> 06:59.605
Yeah, the abrasion marks
aren't very textured.

06:59.607 --> 07:01.503
The cord material could be
something like nylon.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.713
Madison P.D. found
the same DNA on all 3 victims.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.516
And it says here
that the unsub's not in CODIS.

07:05.518 --> 07:07.750

He's either a member of it

07:07.752 --> 07:08.752

07:08.753 --> 07:09.919
Burglary isn't a motive.

07:09.921 --> 07:12.160
At Emma's, he ignored
$200 cash on the dresser

07:12.162 --> 07:13.624
and a box full of
expensive jewelry.

07:13.626 --> 07:15.000
Any signs of forced entry?

07:15.023 --> 07:16.362
Maybe he came in through
an open window.

07:16.363 --> 07:17.245
No to both.

07:17.269 --> 07:18.898
Maybe the unsub used
a ruse to get in.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.771
That's possible.
Could be part of his M.O.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.971
So he's less
detectible.

07:21.973 --> 07:23.603
Maybe he knows
when they go to sleep

07:23.605 --> 07:24.908
or he lies in wait.

07:24.910 --> 07:27.045
If that's the case,
it would take time.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.349

10:26.007 --> 10:30.934
Donna was magnetic.
Everybody loved her.

10:30.936 --> 10:34.436
Did she mention anything
about being followed or watched?

10:34.438 --> 10:39.673
No. All she ever talked
about was church stuff

10:39.675 --> 10:43.879
and these romance novels
she devoured by the bin.

10:43.881 --> 10:47.951
Do you know what Donna's
plans were that night?

10:47.953 --> 10:50.352
Mary said
she was tired

10:50.354 --> 10:52.352
and going home
right after work.

10:52.354 --> 10:55.090
The person who did this
probably knew her.

10:55.092 --> 10:57.458
Was she ever in
a controlling relationship?

10:57.460 --> 11:02.127
Donna was too involved
with church events for dating.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.030
What about
old boyfriends?

11:05.032 --> 11:07.870
They were never
around for long.

11:07.872 --> 11:09.069
Where did she meet them?

11:09.071 --> 11:11.068
Mostly online.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.203
So many of them,
I lost track.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.339
Do any of them
stick out?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.570
Kevin was the only one,

11:17.572 --> 11:21.104
but he died in a car accident
two years ago.

11:22.241 --> 11:24.539
He really broke
her faith.

11:24.541 --> 11:28.534
Losing him got her
wrapped up in those books.

11:28.536 --> 11:30.435
Garcia's still tracking the victims'
cell phone records,

11:30.437 --> 11:31.602
but she was unable to locate

11:31.604 --> 11:33.400
any past high risk
victims in the area.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.205
So what if the area
is first?

11:35.207 --> 11:36.739
Well, they might have
met online.

11:36.741 --> 11:39.274
That's probably
unlikely with Donna.

11:39.276 --> 11:40.738
All she did
was go to church

11:40.740 --> 11:42.505
and binge-read
romance novels.

11:42.507 --> 11:44.442
But then how
did he pick them?

11:44.444 --> 11:46.114
These two victims
just don't match up.

11:46.116 --> 11:48.449
One dates around
and the other didn't at all.

11:48.451 --> 11:50.816
Ok, so what's the link that got
these two targeted

11:50.818 --> 11:52.183

11:58.423 --> 12:00.515
Emma was married
and had an alarm.

12:00.517 --> 12:03.019
That seems like
two giant escalations.

12:03.021 --> 12:06.292
So how'd this guy get around
the system?

12:09.398 --> 12:11.226
Kate?

12:11.228 --> 12:13.696
Yeah, sorry.

12:13.698 --> 12:16.128
Would Emma have disarmed
the system and let him in,

12:16.130 --> 12:17.400
especially that
late at night?

12:17.402 --> 12:18.600
Well, if she didn't
let him in,

12:18.602 --> 12:20.632
he'd only have a few seconds
to cut the feed.

12:20.634 --> 12:22.135
Unless he knew the code.

12:22.137 --> 12:23.406
Would she give out
that information?

12:23.408 --> 12:25.470
Probably not,
but maybe somebody else would.

12:25.472 --> 12:26.672
I mean, who else
knew the code?

12:28.679 --> 12:30.574
Only me and Emma knew it.

12:30.576 --> 12:32.782
I changed the code
every 90 days.

12:32.784 --> 12:35.182
Maybe Emma put the code in her
phone as a reminder

12:35.184 --> 12:38.181
and somehow
it was hacked?

12:38.183 --> 12:42.925
No. No, I wouldn't
let us write it down.

12:42.927 --> 12:46.294
After a home invasion
6 years ago,

12:46.296 --> 12:48.758
uh, I made us memorize it.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.397
Your posture
just changed

12:51.399 --> 12:53.700
when we mentioned
her phone. Why?

12:56.839 --> 13:02.476
I found something
in her--her phone.

13:03.646 --> 13:07.412
They were intimate texts
with a number that I don't know

13:07.414 --> 13:09.516
and can't trace.

13:14.558 --> 13:16.188
[Police radio chatter]

13:16.190 --> 13:18.157
Garcia: That number
belongs to a disposable cell phone.

13:18.159 --> 13:20.357
And how much correspondence
did Emma have with that number?

13:20.359 --> 13:23.198
A lot. Like, hundreds,
a lot.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.735
All from the last
couple of weeks.

13:24.737 --> 13:28.403
Texts, voice calls,
naughty, naughty pictures.

13:28.405 --> 13:31.349
Back and forth.
No faces.

13:31.351 --> 13:32.949
And the feeling
was mutual.

13:32.951 --> 13:35.121
He knew how to push
her sexy buttons,

13:35.123 --> 13:37.089
promising her everything
she was missing in that department.

13:37.091 --> 13:39.322
So this guy built up
a relationship with her first.

13:39.324 --> 13:41.427
Is it the same
with the first two victims?

13:41.429 --> 13:43.363
Uh, checking.
Checking.

13:43.365 --> 13:46.333
Yeah. Yeah, and he corresponded with
each using a different number.

13:46.335 --> 13:48.575
So he either had
a burner phone for each victim

13:48.577 --> 13:50.380
or one phone with
multiple lines.

13:50.382 --> 13:52.086
All right,
thanks, mama.

13:52.088 --> 13:53.583
All right, even though Vernon
was uptight

13:53.585 --> 13:55.654
about home defense,
let's call the security company

13:55.656 --> 13:57.454
and check out
the alarm records.

13:57.456 --> 13:58.621
[Door opens]

13:58.623 --> 13:59.788

Check it out.

14:01.292 --> 14:04.861
Hey, Charlotte.
You're so cute.

Girls, it is dinnertime.
Book bags out of the walkway.

14:07.833 --> 14:09.234
Connie, Melissa,
I am tired--

14:09.236 --> 14:11.169
God, mom, you're
such a tyrant.

14:11.171 --> 14:12.937
Connie Rose,
I am sick and tired--

14:14.043 --> 14:15.376

Daddy!

14:15.378 --> 14:18.248
[Laughs] Hey, sweets.
Daddy!

14:18.250 --> 14:20.049
Hey, Magpie.
All right, all right.

14:20.051 --> 14:22.923
Leftovers on the table.
Let's go.

14:22.925 --> 14:25.051

14:25.053 --> 14:26.988
She'll be your
best friend when she's 25.

14:26.990 --> 14:30.126
Yeah.
How was your day?

14:30.128 --> 14:32.903
Well, Juan aced
his strength test.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.336
He's almost 100%
after his ACL surgery.

14:34.338 --> 14:36.369
How about you?

14:36.371 --> 14:37.441
Busy.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.506
Study group tonight
after class.

14:39.508 --> 14:40.914
I hope it's not gonna be
another all-nighter.

14:40.916 --> 14:42.483
These MCATs
are gonna kill me.

14:42.485 --> 14:46.620
Well, you'll do
great, honey.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.523
Cartilage around
the windpipe was damaged,

14:49.525 --> 14:51.659
but COD was actually
a crushed trachea.

14:51.661 --> 14:54.152
I'm surprised Emma didn't go
into cardiac arrest before then.

14:54.154 --> 14:57.095
Also, each victim has advanced anti-mortem
bruising around their wrists

14:57.097 --> 14:58.462
from the bindings.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.461
Reid: How long was
it before the start

14:59.463 --> 15:00.589
of the bruising
and the kill?

15:00.591 --> 15:01.756
Roughly 6 hours.

15:01.758 --> 15:03.596
Nobody has sex
for 6 straight hours,

15:03.598 --> 15:05.197
not even Sting.

15:05.199 --> 15:07.398
Maybe he's interacting
with them beforehand.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.639
Nonetheless, it's
an endurance test.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.576
He'd have to be
in pretty great physical shape.

15:10.578 --> 15:12.506
The anti-mortem bruising
on the neck

15:12.508 --> 15:15.148
means he strangled
and released repeatedly.

15:15.150 --> 15:16.781
He was toying with them.
Time spent with them

15:16.783 --> 15:18.150
is more important
than the kill.

15:18.152 --> 15:20.191
Well, do you think
the strangulation

15:20.193 --> 15:22.128
is just a dispatching
method, then?

15:22.130 --> 15:25.161
Could be. I mean, what if this is all
about erotic asphyxiation?

15:25.163 --> 15:26.633
If that's the case,

15:26.635 --> 15:29.337
isn't the pleasure usually
all for the recipient?

15:29.339 --> 15:30.969
Maybe not for him.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.072
Cutting off his
victim's air supply

15:32.074 --> 15:35.041
might be how he satisfies
his own urges.

15:40.284 --> 15:42.052
Thank you.

15:42.054 --> 15:45.485
Hey, your mom had a really
rough day at work, ok?

I mean, it's like
you're never around anymore.

15:55.230 --> 15:57.763
I know, it's tough
on me, too.

15:57.765 --> 15:59.602
Well, then I was
thinking that maybe tonight

15:59.604 --> 16:03.863
we could, like, watch
the Badgers game.

16:05.672 --> 16:08.772
Never mind.
It's a dumb idea.

16:28.491 --> 16:29.752
6 hours is
a long time,

16:29.754 --> 16:31.223
especially when
it's late and quiet,

16:31.225 --> 16:32.991
for someone to be
held and no one to hear anything.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.559
Cell records tell us
they communicated

16:34.561 --> 16:36.393
a lot in the weeks
leading up to the murders.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.192
What if the victims
didn't know they were in trouble?

16:39.194 --> 16:43.662
Really? Well, ok.
I have a black lab.

we always had retrievers.

is a total sweetheart.

So, you like being
a chemist?

16:51.944 --> 16:55.141
I mean, I guess,
have you always liked science?

16:55.143 --> 16:57.340
Yeah, pretty much.

16:57.342 --> 17:00.179
It's so, um, I don't know,
this sounds weird,

17:00.181 --> 17:04.714
but chemistry is, well, exhilarating is
not the right word.

17:04.715 --> 17:07.153
You're lucky to have
a passion.

17:07.155 --> 17:09.752
Well, what about you,
do you like being an accountant?

17:09.753 --> 17:12.183
It's been fine.

17:12.185 --> 17:14.821
So, uh, you have kids?

17:14.824 --> 17:18.356
Nope. Never really,
uh, felt the urge, I guess.

No kids.

husband out of town.

17:56.298 --> 17:58.528
Looks like the alarm
wasn't armed that night.

17:58.530 --> 18:01.929
Vernon said he made
sure that Emma always set it,

18:01.931 --> 18:03.569
especially when
he was out of town.

18:03.571 --> 18:05.602
She did,
except for last night.

she ends up dead?

so long?

is Lynn Boyd,

married.

settling on a type.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.881
Yeah, dating sites
like Ashley Madison

19:17.883 --> 19:19.688
suggest married people are more
likely to cheat

19:19.690 --> 19:20.888

married people.

destruction.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.326
Yeah. One party's
less likely

19:25.328 --> 19:28.389
to confess if they
know it could hurt them, too.

19:28.391 --> 19:31.292
But even with this set-up,

19:31.294 --> 19:34.627
people still have
their hearts broken.

very quietly.

If Emma was gonna stray,
she'd probably do it with a married man,

which means most likely
this guy's married.

there's something vaguely
familiar about that passage.

the “how can I help you?” way,

not in the--
'cause you're super lovely.

aren't I?

the romance novel “Bare Reflections”?

20:29.004 --> 20:31.368
I can tell you
it's very popular.

20:31.370 --> 20:34.804
And let me see. Typing and checking
and typing and...

20:34.806 --> 20:37.466
It is way more popular
than I thought.

20:37.468 --> 20:38.634
How popular?

20:38.636 --> 20:40.203
Uh, like cultural
phenomenon.

20:40.205 --> 20:41.972
Like, licensed products,

20:41.974 --> 20:44.105
like red silk scarves
and lingerie.

20:44.107 --> 20:46.145
And, ooh,
my personal favorite

20:46.147 --> 20:48.944
is a baby onesie
that says “9 months ago

20:48.946 --> 20:50.976
my mom read
'Bare Reflections,'”

20:50.978 --> 20:53.114
which is super creepy
and weirdly cute.

20:53.116 --> 20:55.019
Clearly I'm in
the wrong genre.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.452
If this book is mainstream,

20:56.454 --> 20:58.829
then his victim pool
is large.

20:58.831 --> 21:00.725
Garcia, did any of
the other victims

21:00.727 --> 21:02.895
besides Lynn
own a copy?

Uh, let's see.

on her tablet.

of the library twice.

21:08.275 --> 21:11.541

purchased copies locally.

the saucy texts

21:14.970 --> 21:16.503
are direct quotes
from the book.

21:16.505 --> 21:17.702
Oh, speaking of texts.

21:17.704 --> 21:20.404
I culled from them that he met
Mary via message board,

21:20.406 --> 21:23.276
Donna at a coffee shop,
Emma at the gym,

21:23.278 --> 21:26.950
and Lynn, he met Lynn
using a fake profile

on a discrete dating
website for married people.

Thanks, Garcia.

21:30.919 --> 21:32.485
Profile?

21:32.487 --> 21:34.421
Based on area demographics,

21:34.423 --> 21:36.655
we believe that we're looking
or a physically fit white male

21:36.657 --> 21:38.222
in his mid thirties
to early forties.

21:38.224 --> 21:40.926
He's a homicidal dominant
with an interest in role play.

21:40.928 --> 21:42.927
We believe his charisma
has allowed him

21:42.929 --> 21:44.799
to latch on to women
who are interested

21:44.801 --> 21:49.866
in a popular erotic romance novel
called “Bare Reflections.”

21:49.868 --> 21:51.769

a sheltered female teacher

21:51.771 --> 21:53.704

with a dark past

into a submissive role.

her initial worries,

can't live without Carson Bare,

warts and all.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.741
We believe the unsub
and his victims

22:03.743 --> 22:07.110
are consensually recreating
a scenario from this book.

22:07.112 --> 22:10.117
In that scene, Carson introduces
Amber to BDSM

22:10.119 --> 22:12.453
by binding her to a bed as they
have rough sex.

22:12.455 --> 22:14.486
The unsub uses
this role play to get his victims

22:14.488 --> 22:16.053
into a vulnerable position

22:16.055 --> 22:18.988
before his own fantasy
takes hold.

22:18.990 --> 22:21.386
This has provided the unsub
with a victim pool

22:21.388 --> 22:23.160
who have dropped
their guard.

22:23.162 --> 22:24.327
His first victims
were single,

22:24.329 --> 22:25.790
but his last two
were married.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.988
This escalation indicates that he may
be married himself

22:27.990 --> 22:29.923
and probably has
a family.

22:29.925 --> 22:32.088
[Baby cries]

22:37.727 --> 22:40.731
This unsub's M.O.
takes patience and caution

22:40.733 --> 22:42.626
and is firmly rooted
in a need-based desire,

22:42.628 --> 22:44.961
which means he won't be stopping
anytime soon.

it's not ok.

But grounding me
for a month

my phone away is ok?

house turn into some sort of a gulag?

23:09.011 --> 23:12.840
Ahem. I know that this
is a huge adjustment.

23:12.842 --> 23:14.543
Do you?
Yeah, of course I do.

by surprise,

23:16.146 --> 23:19.584
but it's a good thing.

23:19.586 --> 23:25.255
We're changing our dynamic,
but no one's going anywhere.

23:27.256 --> 23:30.421
Nothing that's happened
to you has been fair.

23:30.423 --> 23:32.188
And I know that.

23:32.190 --> 23:34.723
But I also know that you
are the greatest thing

23:34.725 --> 23:35.859
that's ever happened to me,

23:35.861 --> 23:39.764
and you are going to be
an amazing big sister.

23:39.766 --> 23:42.604
An addition to our family
is not a replacement.

23:42.606 --> 23:44.571
Ok?

23:47.877 --> 23:48.907
I have to go.

23:48.909 --> 23:51.243
Meg--
[Phone beeps]

23:56.518 --> 23:58.685
[Phone beeps]

24:00.888 --> 24:04.092
Hey, uh, Chris, I don't think
that Meg is hearing me,

24:04.094 --> 24:08.194
so we're gonna need
a better plan.

24:11.164 --> 24:12.626
I'm just never
gonna get it.

24:12.628 --> 24:15.099
Second order derivatives
again?

24:15.101 --> 24:16.499
You want help,
come by later.

24:16.501 --> 24:17.668
I'll be up studying
for the bar.

24:17.670 --> 24:18.972
Cool.

24:22.079 --> 24:23.877
Hey, sweets.
Hi, Dad.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.349
[Chuckles]

24:26.351 --> 24:28.685
Tell Stacey I left my copy of
“Bare Reflections”

24:28.687 --> 24:31.654
on the kitchen
counter for her.

24:40.302 --> 24:43.142
So, how's, uh,
how's the studying?

24:43.144 --> 24:44.710
Going pretty well.

24:46.713 --> 24:48.514
You'll make
a great lawyer.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.420
Thanks.

24:52.453 --> 24:54.218
It's a little sad,
too.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.257
I mean, you guys
have treated me like family.

24:56.259 --> 24:58.488
Oh, we really appreciate
all the extra time lately.

24:58.490 --> 25:01.295
No problem.
I really like it.

25:04.295 --> 25:07.028
It's nice to be part
of something.

25:20.372 --> 25:22.168
It's great.

25:22.170 --> 25:25.037
The girls have two strong
female role models.

25:25.039 --> 25:26.509
They've certainly
got work ethic

25:26.511 --> 25:27.844
and dedication
from their dad.

25:27.846 --> 25:30.212
Me? [Laughs]
I don't work that hard.

25:30.214 --> 25:31.547
I practically sleep
through class,

25:31.549 --> 25:33.378
but, hey, don't tell Stace.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.045
Have a great run.

25:41.047 --> 25:42.285
Nice weather for it.

25:42.287 --> 25:44.150
Mmm.

25:52.933 --> 25:55.098
[Mumbling]

25:59.275 --> 26:01.874
There's not a single mention of erotic
asphyxiation anywhere.

26:01.876 --> 26:04.007
It's the unsub's fetish,
then.

26:04.009 --> 26:06.406
He's a charmer that knows that some
people lose themselves in the moment

26:06.408 --> 26:09.281
and others stop at nothing
to please their partners.

26:09.283 --> 26:11.145
Somehow he makes his
victims feel safe enough

26:11.147 --> 26:12.713
to abandon
their hard limit.

26:12.715 --> 26:13.953
What's a hard limit?

26:13.955 --> 26:16.859
It's a common
BDSM practice.

26:16.861 --> 26:20.562
Hard limits are anything
that's an automatic no-go.

26:20.564 --> 26:22.793
It differs by person
and taste.

26:22.795 --> 26:24.128
And a soft limit is
an action in which

26:24.130 --> 26:26.759
a dismissive hesitates
or places strict conditions on.

26:26.761 --> 26:29.262
I had no idea that world
had so many regulations.

26:29.264 --> 26:31.134
Where does he find
somebody like-minded?

26:31.136 --> 26:32.398
In “Bare Reflections,”

26:32.400 --> 26:34.703
Carson Bare takes
Amber to a event called a munch.

26:34.705 --> 26:35.872
Which is?

26:35.874 --> 26:37.409
According to the book, it's
a social gathering

26:37.411 --> 26:38.777
for people
interested in BDSM.

26:38.779 --> 26:40.210
Where the heck
do you find that?

26:40.212 --> 26:41.242
We should call
Garcia.

26:41.244 --> 26:42.819
I found one.

26:45.086 --> 26:47.685
I'm sorry,
but I've never seen them.

26:47.687 --> 26:49.620
Well, what type of women
do you see most?

26:49.622 --> 26:51.555
High-powered
professionals.

26:51.557 --> 26:52.755
After barking
orders all day,

26:52.757 --> 26:54.794
they need
a submissive outlet.

26:54.796 --> 26:57.332
And how has “Bare Reflections”
influenced the scene?

26:57.334 --> 26:58.901
By completely
ruining it.

26:58.903 --> 27:01.207
Interest in the munch I host
has gone up.

27:01.209 --> 27:02.807
Wait, that's a good
thing, isn't it?

27:02.809 --> 27:04.408
It's amateur hour.

27:04.410 --> 27:05.808
They flaunt
their red scarves

27:05.810 --> 27:07.849
and they act like
Carson Bare is real.

27:07.851 --> 27:11.313
My group is a safe haven
for true dialogue.

27:11.315 --> 27:13.689
And instead, you see
desperate soccer moms

27:13.691 --> 27:14.985
looking to impress
their friends.

27:14.987 --> 27:16.352
Exactly.

27:16.354 --> 27:17.919
They've taken over.

27:17.921 --> 27:20.487
They act all risqué,
but they really aren't.

27:20.489 --> 27:22.224
And they ignore our rules.

27:22.226 --> 27:24.032
'Cause despite
its popular image

27:24.034 --> 27:25.633
as dark and orgiastic,

27:25.635 --> 27:28.906
BDSM play has
complex rituals, roles

27:28.908 --> 27:32.371
and dynamics that frame the experience.
Am I right?

27:32.373 --> 27:33.843
Yes.

27:33.845 --> 27:36.643
We feel the key ingredients
of good BDSM play--

27:36.645 --> 27:39.042
communication,
respect, trust--

27:39.044 --> 27:42.344
result in the same connection
to body and self

27:42.346 --> 27:44.848
found in positive
traditional sex.

27:44.850 --> 27:48.118
So the end result
is like yoga. Sort of.

27:48.120 --> 27:51.518
Has anyone come in
wanting to discuss

27:51.520 --> 27:53.623
breath play?
No.

27:53.625 --> 27:56.960
That topic's forbidden,
and any attempt gets a lifetime ban.

27:56.962 --> 27:59.968
Well, if you hear something,
please let us know.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.769
I will.

28:05.308 --> 28:08.275
What? I dabbled
my senior year.

28:08.277 --> 28:09.277
Ah, college.

28:09.277 --> 28:11.241
Ah, high school.

28:12.851 --> 28:15.384
[Groans]

28:15.386 --> 28:17.680
A group like this should
have been a haven

28:17.682 --> 28:21.454
for the unsub's recruitment,
but it wasn't.

28:21.456 --> 28:22.822
Hey, are you ok?

28:22.824 --> 28:24.117
I didn't mean
to weird you out.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.158
[Chuckles] Sorry.
I just can't shake the idea

28:26.160 --> 28:28.990
of no high-risk victims.
I mean, you must have, right?

28:28.992 --> 28:31.629
Garcia checked the Madison area
and found nothing.

28:31.631 --> 28:34.564
So, what if the victims
were all outside the Madison area?

28:41.169 --> 28:44.030
[Music playing
in headphones]

28:56.704 --> 28:58.869
[Gasps]

29:30.979 --> 29:33.376
[Cell phone rings]
[Gasps]

29:33.378 --> 29:35.878
[Ring]

29:37.583 --> 29:39.780
Hey, you're almost here?

29:39.782 --> 29:43.374
Perfect.
Yeah, I'm ready.

29:43.376 --> 29:46.108
Cool, see you soon.

30:00.656 --> 30:02.855
Connie: Dad?

30:04.627 --> 30:06.793
[Engine starts]

30:19.742 --> 30:22.576
Looking for past high-risk victims
outside of Madison

30:22.576 --> 30:24.749
is completely ingenious,
because now we're getting somewhere.

30:24.751 --> 30:26.349
I mean, fool me once
and all that,

30:26.351 --> 30:28.147
but don't worry, you're not going to be
able to fool me twice,

30:28.149 --> 30:29.410
because I'm going
to get you!

30:29.412 --> 30:31.185
Hotch: Garcia.
Sorry, sir.

30:31.187 --> 30:32.616
I'm just,
I'm super pumped

30:32.618 --> 30:34.615
because I've used
my complete and total

30:34.617 --> 30:37.286
bad-assery-ness to bust
a move through layers

30:37.288 --> 30:39.149
of local legal bureaucracy,

30:39.151 --> 30:40.883
and I have learned
that Sarah young,

30:40.885 --> 30:43.293
a street prostitute in St. Paul--
say that five times fast--

30:43.295 --> 30:44.959
was murdered last year.

30:44.961 --> 30:47.327
And I bet she was
strangled during a rendezvous.

30:47.329 --> 30:48.766
Me oui. And get this--

30:48.768 --> 30:51.102
two other prostitutes,
both strangled with nylon rope,

30:51.104 --> 30:53.136
turned up 8 and 15 years ago.

30:53.138 --> 30:55.810
One in Iowa City,
the other in rural Illinois.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.242
He knew crossing state lines would
make it more difficult

30:57.244 --> 30:58.545
to link the crimes.

30:58.547 --> 31:00.482
That's a very different
cooling off period.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.050
I wonder what was so special
about those dates.

31:02.052 --> 31:04.484
First kills were in 2000,

31:04.486 --> 31:06.389
2007,

31:06.391 --> 31:09.462
and then he went dormant
until last year.

31:09.464 --> 31:11.190
What triggers him?

31:11.192 --> 31:13.328
Deaths in the family?
He could keep losing jobs.

31:13.330 --> 31:17.031
These are sex crimes,
so what interferes with sex drive?

31:17.033 --> 31:19.039
Children.
The addition of a child

31:19.041 --> 31:20.903
would disrupt even the happiest
of couples.

31:20.905 --> 31:22.280
More specifically,
the births.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.234
What if each of these kills

31:23.258 --> 31:24.944
corresponds to the births
of the unsub's own children?

31:24.945 --> 31:25.828
Garcia, how many men

31:25.852 --> 31:27.568
in the hunting zone
had a child in 2000?

31:29.345 --> 31:31.109
Mom, where's dad?

31:31.111 --> 31:34.580
Study group.
Why, what's up?

31:34.582 --> 31:37.715
Uh, nothing,
I was just...

31:37.717 --> 31:39.723
thinking about
Charlotte. [Sighs]

31:39.725 --> 31:42.187
Uh-huh.

31:43.827 --> 31:45.825
I mean, I think she...

31:45.827 --> 31:47.993
[Washing dish]

31:50.298 --> 31:52.431
I forgot my calculus book
at Charlotte's

31:52.433 --> 31:53.999
the other night.

31:54.001 --> 31:56.294
I need it to finish
my homework for Monday.

31:56.296 --> 31:59.068
Uh-huh.

31:59.070 --> 32:02.100
God, Mom, do you
ever listen to me?

32:02.102 --> 32:04.268
[Sighs]

32:05.607 --> 32:06.772
I'm slicing through
hospital records.

32:06.774 --> 32:11.306
In 2000, 16 area men,
Caucasian in that age range,

32:11.308 --> 32:12.642
had their first child,
and because I know what

32:12.644 --> 32:14.282
the follow up question
is going to be,

32:14.284 --> 32:17.217
five of them had
their second child 8 years ago.

32:17.219 --> 32:18.852
And again last year?

32:18.854 --> 32:20.221
Hmm...Two lucky fellas.

32:20.223 --> 32:21.926
Were either one
of them busted

32:21.928 --> 32:23.822
for something like
peeping or exposure?

32:23.824 --> 32:26.326
Yes and no. There's
a Patrick John Murphy,

32:26.328 --> 32:28.061
he's a physical therapist.
Here's the thing--

32:28.063 --> 32:29.829
he was never actually arrested.

32:29.831 --> 32:32.165
I do have some sealed
family court docs, though,

32:32.167 --> 32:34.003
that I'm about
to unseal and learn...

32:34.005 --> 32:35.634
[Gasps] Oh, when he was 12,

32:35.636 --> 32:38.232
he witnessed his neighbor
strangle his wife to death

32:38.234 --> 32:40.799
in a sex game gone bad.

32:40.801 --> 32:42.103
Even though he was only
a witness, that moment

32:42.105 --> 32:44.071
created a single event
imprint on his love map

32:44.073 --> 32:45.708
and probably started his
interest in breath play.

32:45.710 --> 32:47.202
Is his wife
interested in BDSM?

32:47.204 --> 32:48.904
Uh, no, it doesn't
look like it.

32:48.906 --> 32:51.208
The Murphys have been
in and out of couples therapy for years.

32:51.210 --> 32:52.903
The therapy rollercoaster
may have been due

32:52.905 --> 32:55.005
to intermittent periods of frustration
then bliss surrounding the murders.

32:55.007 --> 32:57.540
And his urges increase
during periods of non-intimacy.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.709
If the unsub's trigger was
the birth of his kids,

32:59.711 --> 33:01.181
why change
the victimology

33:01.183 --> 33:03.117
and accelerate
the kills now?

33:03.118 --> 33:05.282
I think the guilt he's felt
has been alleviated by “Bare Reflections”

33:05.285 --> 33:06.987
and the intense
female interest in it

33:06.989 --> 33:08.251
has justified his impulses.

33:08.253 --> 33:09.555
Hotch: Garcia,
we need addresses.

33:09.557 --> 33:11.291
Garcia: Of course, I just
sent them to you.

33:11.293 --> 33:13.460
[Beeping]

33:20.733 --> 33:22.930
FBI!
[Gasps]

33:22.932 --> 33:25.402
Stacy Murphy,
where is your husband?

33:27.739 --> 33:30.568
I could have brought over Connie's
books sometime this weekend.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.040
It's not a problem.
I was in the area.

33:32.042 --> 33:33.303
Didn't want you
to worry about it.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.108
But it's my job
to worry about it.

33:35.110 --> 33:37.403
Is your inner
tigress worried,

33:37.405 --> 33:39.076
or is she ready
for you to be free?

33:39.077 --> 33:42.811
Did you just quote
that lame ass “Bare Reflections?”

33:42.814 --> 33:45.285
admit it.

33:45.287 --> 33:50.191
That book got you
all worked up.

33:50.193 --> 33:51.193
I know it did.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.593
[Gasps] I think
you should go.

33:53.595 --> 33:55.192
For the sake of Stacy
and the girls,

33:55.194 --> 33:57.965
I'll pretend
this never happened.

33:57.967 --> 34:00.098
[Gasping]

34:03.329 --> 34:05.969
[Yelling]

34:09.405 --> 34:11.475
Patrick is a great dad.
There's no way that--

34:11.476 --> 34:13.746
has he ever mentioned
the book “Bare Reflections?”

34:13.748 --> 34:15.877
I just borrowed
a copy from our nanny.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.085
But what does
that have--

34:17.087 --> 34:18.215
Where is she now?

34:18.217 --> 34:19.753
At home studying.

34:19.755 --> 34:20.824
What does
Charlotte--

34:20.827 --> 34:23.129
Mrs. Murphy,
we need her address.

34:23.130 --> 34:24.625
Patrick could be...

34:24.627 --> 34:25.993
Oh, God!

34:25.995 --> 34:29.204
No, please! Please, don't, Patrick!
don't do this!

34:29.206 --> 34:30.469
No!

34:30.471 --> 34:32.809
[Patrick grunting]

34:32.811 --> 34:34.812
[Yelling]

to feel abandoned.

39:17.275 --> 39:18.705
Come on,
by you? No way.

Well. A year ago, I would have agreed
with you, but she's...

39:22.115 --> 39:23.914
She's 13, Callahan.

Ah, yes, that's right.
