WEBVTT

00:07.408 --> 00:08.779
- PREVIOUSLY ON TWISTED...
- Desai's released

00:08.779 --> 00:11.011
from the detention facility
that has held him

00:11.011 --> 00:12.413
since he strangled his aunt.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.614
WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT NECKLACE?

00:13.614 --> 00:16.347
A housekeeper discovered
Regina Crane

00:16.347 --> 00:17.748
- beaten to death--
- Jo: I DON'T KNOW

00:17.748 --> 00:20.020
IF DANNY DID THIS OR NOT,
BUT DO YOU?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.123
- I KNOW ABOUT LAST NIGHT?
- PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE.

00:22.123 --> 00:22.753
YOU HAVE TO TELL EVERYONE.

00:22.753 --> 00:24.155
I DO NEED YOU TO COME IN

00:24.155 --> 00:25.196
AND GIVE YOUR
OFFICIAL STATEMENT.

00:25.196 --> 00:26.597
MY STATEMENT?

00:26.597 --> 00:28.028
- YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
- YOU DON'T KNOW ME EITHER.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.160
ABOUT OUR SLEEPOVER,

00:29.160 --> 00:31.132
I DIDN'T TELL CHIEF MASTERSON
ABOUT IT

00:31.132 --> 00:32.763
AND I ASKED JO
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING EITHER.

00:32.763 --> 00:34.805
DANNY WASN'T ALONE THE NIGHT
REGINA WAS MURDERED.

00:34.805 --> 00:36.067
LACEY SPENT THE NIGHT.

00:36.067 --> 00:37.468
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS PROVE TO HIM

00:37.468 --> 00:39.039
THAT SOMEONE ELSE
KILLED REGINA.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.371
I NOTICED A SHELF
OF FAMILY PHOTOS.

00:40.371 --> 00:42.042
AND THERE WAS ONE
WITH TARA DESAI IN IT.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.174
WHEN WE LEFT,
THE PHOTO WAS GONE.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.721
PLEASE DON'T DRIVE.
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

00:50.721 --> 00:53.124
GIVE ME THE KEYS NOW.

00:53.124 --> 00:54.725
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

00:54.725 --> 00:56.827
Sarita: YEAH, YOU'RE
NOT THE BOSS OF US.

00:56.827 --> 00:59.390
( robotic )
WE HAVE TO DRINK TO BE COOL.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.732
( chuckles )

01:01.732 --> 01:06.597
YEAH, WE'RE UNDER
A LOT OF PEER PRESSURE

01:06.597 --> 01:08.339
TO GET ACCEPTED
BY OUR PEERS.

01:08.339 --> 01:09.770
( mocking laughter )

01:09.770 --> 01:11.302
CUT!

01:11.302 --> 01:12.773
ARE YOU TRYING
TO RUIN MY LIFE?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.805
WHAT?
THIS IS FUNNY.

01:14.805 --> 01:17.278
IT'S A COMEDY, RIGHT?

01:17.278 --> 01:20.080
NO, IT IS A HEARTBREAKING
CAUTIONARY

01:20.080 --> 01:23.584
TALE ABOUT THE DANGERS
OF UNDERAGE DRINKING
AND DRIVING.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.086
Sarita: MY FOOT HURTS.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.119
I NEED A BREAK.

01:28.119 --> 01:30.761
WE ONLY HAVE 48 HOURS UNTIL
SOBRIETY AWARENESS DAY.

01:30.761 --> 01:33.464
AND THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
IS EAGERLY ANTICIPATING

01:33.464 --> 01:36.096
- THIS ASSEMBLY SO...
- ISN'T IT MANDATORY?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.428
NOT THE POINT, LACEY.

01:37.428 --> 01:40.531
WE NEED TO BE AMAZING.

01:40.531 --> 01:42.102
WELL, THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.174
LOOK, IF WE ALL

01:43.174 --> 01:45.176
WORK REALLY HARD,

01:45.176 --> 01:47.838
I KNOW THAT WE CAN MAKE
TEENAGE SOBRIETY

01:47.838 --> 01:49.880
SEEM PRETTY AWESOME.

01:49.880 --> 01:50.811
AM I RIGHT?

01:53.484 --> 01:55.586
OKAY, WHATEVER.
START FROM THE TOP.

01:59.650 --> 02:02.122
( door opens )

02:02.122 --> 02:03.324
Jo: HEY.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.755
HOW WAS YOUR
THERAPY SESSION?

02:04.755 --> 02:06.897
THERAPEUTIC.

02:06.897 --> 02:08.829
TONIGHT I LEARNED
THAT IF I

02:08.829 --> 02:10.661
TRY HARDER TO FIT IN
AT SCHOOL,

02:10.661 --> 02:12.903
PEOPLE WILL TOTALLY
START TRUSTING ME AGAIN.

02:12.903 --> 02:13.904
Rico: YEAH.

02:13.904 --> 02:15.266
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BE

02:15.266 --> 02:16.707
CLEARED OF THE WHOLE
MURDERING REGINA THING

02:16.707 --> 02:18.709
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.140
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT, RICO.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.772
MAN, I WISH WE COULD
BE MORE HELPFUL.

02:21.772 --> 02:23.344
JUST KIND OF HARD

02:23.344 --> 02:24.675
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO REGINA

02:24.675 --> 02:26.577
IF WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HER.

02:26.577 --> 02:27.678
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOME OTHER PEOPLE

02:27.678 --> 02:29.650
WE CAN TALK TO THOUGH,
RIGHT?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.522
CLASSMATES?

02:31.522 --> 02:33.684
OTHER FRIENDS?

02:33.684 --> 02:36.557
PEOPLE YOU KNOW FROM
EXTRACURRICULAR STUFF?

02:36.557 --> 02:40.361
WE DECIDED TO JUST FOCUS
ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.932
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY JO AND I
HAVE THE HIGHEST GPA'S

02:41.932 --> 02:43.834
- IN THE SCHOOL.
- WOW, YOU GUYS

02:43.834 --> 02:46.367
ARE REALLY GETTING THE FULL
HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE,
AREN'T YOU?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.499
NOT EVERYONE NEEDS
TO TURN HIGH SCHOOL

02:48.499 --> 02:50.701
INTO SOME LAME
SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.

02:50.701 --> 02:53.504
SOME OF US JUST WANT TO
LEARN SOMETHING AND GET OUT.

02:53.504 --> 02:54.545
FAIR ENOUGH.

02:54.545 --> 02:57.208
SO YOU GUYS GO TO SCHOOL

02:57.208 --> 02:59.880
AND THEN YOU COME HERE
AND YOU STUDY.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.752
- YEAH.
- NO.

03:01.752 --> 03:03.754
I MEAN I ALSO DRIVE

03:03.754 --> 03:06.487
TO SCHOOL EVERYDAY
WITH MY DAD.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.792
( sighs ) OKAY.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.864
WHAT IF I TRIED
TALKING TO LACEY?

03:13.864 --> 03:14.895
LACEY?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.627
SHE WON'T EVEN
SAY SHE WAS WITH YOU

03:16.627 --> 03:17.828
THE NIGHT OF REGINA'S MURDER.

03:17.828 --> 03:19.670
I KNOW, BUT...

03:19.670 --> 03:23.874
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES
I JUST GET THIS SENSE

03:23.874 --> 03:26.907
THAT SHE MISSES US
OR SOMETHING.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.280
PLUS LACEY'S SUPER CONNECTED

03:29.280 --> 03:30.541
TO THIS SCHOOL.
I MEAN SHE KNOWS

03:30.541 --> 03:31.742
EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING
ABOUT IT.

03:31.742 --> 03:33.584
AND SHE'S REGINA'S BFF.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.348
IT'S BE NICE, RIGHT?

03:37.348 --> 03:38.749
JO?

03:38.749 --> 03:40.451
HAVING LACEY IN OUR LIVES AGAIN?

03:40.451 --> 03:43.824
I JUST DON'T WANT
YOU TO BE DISAPPOINTED.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.225
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME,
MASTERSON.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.697
I CAN BE VERY,
VERY CHARMING.

03:46.697 --> 03:48.329
- ( laughs )
- WORKED ON YOU, DIDN'T IT?

03:48.329 --> 03:50.961
DON'T GET COCKY, DESAI.

03:50.961 --> 03:52.833
MAN, I JUST WISH
I COULD OFFER

03:52.833 --> 03:54.535
YOU SOMETHING MORE THAN
A PARENT

03:54.535 --> 03:56.437
THAT'S TRYING TO PUT
YOU BACK IN PRISON.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.568
WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS.

03:57.568 --> 03:59.640
LACEY'S A GOOD PLAN.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.272
YEAH, AND THIS WAY,
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK
TO ANY ANNOYING PEOPLE.

04:01.272 --> 04:02.273
RIGHT, JO?

04:02.273 --> 04:04.475
YEAH.

04:06.377 --> 04:09.580
Archie: THAT PHOEBE
IS A PERKY DEMON MONSTER.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.722
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE AGREED TO DO THIS.

04:11.722 --> 04:12.823
WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

04:12.823 --> 04:14.685
AND A SKIT BEATS WRITING
SOME STUPID ESSAY.

04:14.685 --> 04:15.856
I DON'T KNOW.
WRITING AN ESSAY

04:15.856 --> 04:17.828
ABOUT NOT DRINKING MIGHT
BE BETTER THAN HAVING

04:17.828 --> 04:19.760
PHOEBE YELL AT ME
TO EMOTE MORE

04:19.760 --> 04:21.362
WITH MY FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.794
- ( giggles )
- I'M KIDDING.

04:23.794 --> 04:25.566
I'M GLAD WE'RE DOING THIS.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.738
THAT WAY I GET TO SPEND MORE
TIME WITH MY HOT GIRLFRIEND.

04:32.843 --> 04:34.905
YOU'RE STRESSING
ABOUT TOMORROW, AREN'T YOU?

04:34.905 --> 04:36.847
WHAT? NO.
I'M FINE.

04:36.847 --> 04:39.510
- IT'LL BE FINE.
- THAT'S WHAT I KEEP
TELLING YOU.

04:39.510 --> 04:42.853
CHIEF MASTERSON'S COOL
UNLIKE HIS WEIRD DAUGHTER.

04:42.853 --> 04:45.756
BUT MY STATEMENT TOOK ME
LIKE FIVE MINUTES.

04:45.756 --> 04:48.859
YOU WERE HOME THE NIGHT
OF REGINA'S PARTY.

04:48.859 --> 04:49.890
THERE WASN'T
MUCH TO SAY.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.863
WELL, YOU LEFT THE PARTY
AND WENT HOME.

04:52.863 --> 04:55.866
I MEAN HOW MUCH MORE
COMPLICATED IS THAT?

04:55.866 --> 04:57.898
YEAH, IT'S NOT.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.970
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NOT.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.882
( theme music playing )

05:17.918 --> 05:20.551
WELL, I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE

05:20.551 --> 05:22.793
WITH HECTOR
DOWN AT THE STUDIO.

05:22.793 --> 05:25.756
I'M OFFICIALLY NO LONGER
RENTING SPACE FROM THEM.

05:25.756 --> 05:27.428
THAT PLACE WAS
A RIP-OFF ANYWAY.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.799
WE HAVE AN ENTIRE GARAGE
FULL OF ROOM

05:28.799 --> 05:31.031
FOR YOUR KILN,
YOUR POTTERY WHEELS,

05:31.031 --> 05:32.903
ALL YOUR WORK.

05:32.903 --> 05:35.105
YEAH, A GARAGE FILLED
WITH YEARS OF CRAP.

05:35.105 --> 05:37.768
YOU'RE HELPING ME
CLEAR IT OUT TONIGHT, RIGHT?

05:37.768 --> 05:39.810
OF COURSE, HONEY.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.643
YOU GUYS ARE SO ADORABLE.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.875
I LOVE HOW YOU MAKE
THAT SOUND LIKE AN INSULT.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.047
WHAT'S ON TOP
FOR SCHOOL TODAY?

05:47.047 --> 05:49.680
OH, NOTHING TOO EXCITING.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.982
HOW'S WORK?

05:51.982 --> 05:53.654
WORK?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.726
WORK IS GOOD.

05:55.726 --> 05:56.787
BUSY.

05:56.787 --> 05:58.959
CARE TO ELABORATE ON BUSY?

05:58.959 --> 06:02.433
YOU KNOW I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MY CASES, RIGHT?

06:02.433 --> 06:04.695
ANY OF THEM.

06:04.695 --> 06:07.367
I GUESS I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU HAD A REAL SUSPECT YET.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.368
OKAY.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.000
HOW ABOUT A FUN NEW RULE?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.372
NO TALKING ABOUT SUSPECTS

06:12.372 --> 06:14.044
OR MURDERS OR DANNY
AT BREAKFAST.

06:14.044 --> 06:15.806
Tess: SOUND GOOD?

06:15.806 --> 06:16.807
Kyle: AGREED.

06:16.807 --> 06:18.879
OR ON THE RIDE
TO SCHOOL.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.051
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:21.051 --> 06:23.484
I THINK I'M GONNA
WALK TO SCHOOL.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.855
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:24.855 --> 06:26.757
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
THE SAME THING EVERYDAY.

06:26.757 --> 06:29.019
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO
SHAKE THINGS UP A BIT.

06:31.422 --> 06:32.863
- BYE.
- BYE.

06:36.827 --> 06:38.398
- ( door closes )
- DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.000
I'M NOT.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.904
YOU STILL GONNA TRY TO TALK
TO KAREN ON YOUR WAY IN?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.936
YEAH, "TRY" BEING
THE OPERATIVE WORD.

06:45.936 --> 06:47.878
YOU SURE YOU DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT PHOTO

06:47.878 --> 06:49.510
OF TARA DESAI?
ANY DETAILS?

06:49.510 --> 06:50.811
I WISH I DID.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.644
I GUESS SHE LOOKED
PRETTY PISSED OFF IN IT.

06:53.644 --> 06:55.085
TARA ALWAYS
LOOKED PISSED OFF.

06:56.587 --> 06:57.988
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

06:57.988 --> 06:59.019
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

07:03.694 --> 07:04.925
TOP OF THE MORNING
TO YOU.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.898
AH, I GET IT.

07:07.898 --> 07:09.960
SO IT'S OKAY TO TALK TO ME
IN PRIVATE,

07:09.960 --> 07:11.932
BUT NOT IN THE HALLOWED HALLS
OF GREEN GROVE HIGH?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.133
GLAD YOU'RE CATCHING ON.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.835
I--

07:14.835 --> 07:16.607
I MIGHT BE MISREADING
THIS SITUATION HERE,

07:16.607 --> 07:19.139
BUT ARE YOU AFRAID
TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC WITH ME?

07:19.139 --> 07:21.041
LOOK AT YOU, MR. PERCEPTIVE.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.614
THAT'S WHAT MY FANCY
NEW THERAPIST IS CALLING ME,

07:23.614 --> 07:25.576
BUT I THINK SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO BOOST MY SELF-ESTEEM.

07:27.017 --> 07:28.448
IS THIS FREAK BOTHERING YOU?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.450
ARCHIE, I'M SO GLAD
YOU ASKED.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.952
SHE KINDA IS.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.924
- PSYCHO MADE A FUNNY.
- YOU GUYS, CAN WE PLEASE

07:33.924 --> 07:34.925
AVOID A SEQUEL TO THAT FIGHT?

07:34.925 --> 07:36.487
THAT'S COOL WITH ME.

07:36.487 --> 07:37.758
ARCHIE?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.059
OH, YOU'RE NOT IN THIS
CONVERSATION ANYMORE.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.631
COMPRENDE.

07:51.942 --> 07:53.904
CHIEF MASTERSON,

07:53.904 --> 07:56.176
OH, I'M SORRY.
I JUST FINISHED BREAKFAST.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.248
BUT IF YOU WANT TO YELL AT ME
WHILE I'M DRINKING MY COFFEE--

07:58.248 --> 08:00.881
KAREN, I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY
FOR THE OTHER NIGHT.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.112
I WAS A GUEST IN YOUR HOME

08:02.112 --> 08:03.884
AND I HAD NO RIGHT
TO DISRESPECT YOU LIKE THAT.

08:03.884 --> 08:04.885
OR DANNY.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.257
FINE.
THANK YOU.

08:07.257 --> 08:09.089
THAT ALL?

08:09.089 --> 08:11.722
CAN I COME IN FOR A MINUTE?

08:11.722 --> 08:13.023
HMM, I'M REALLY BUSY.

08:13.023 --> 08:14.695
KEEPING THE PLACE UP
I'M SURE.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.996
TESS AND I WERE TALKING
LAST NIGHT

08:15.996 --> 08:17.698
ABOUT HOW GREAT
THE HOUSE LOOKS.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.129
THANKS, YEAH.

08:19.129 --> 08:20.731
I'VE HAD TO MAINTAIN IT
OVER THE YEARS,

08:20.731 --> 08:23.033
HOPING TO ATTRACT BUYERS
HOWEVER UNLIKELY.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.975
TOUGH MARKET.

08:27.778 --> 08:29.910
- WELL, THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
- ONE QUICK QUESTION, KAREN.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.582
WHEN WE WERE OVER
FOR DINNER,

08:31.582 --> 08:33.513
TESS NOTICED
A PHOTO OF TARA,

08:33.513 --> 08:36.947
BUT IT WAS GONE
BY THE TIME WE LEFT.

08:36.947 --> 08:39.049
AND?

08:39.049 --> 08:41.852
I WAS JUST CURIOUS
WHY YOU MIGHT HAVE MOVED IT

08:41.852 --> 08:44.024
OR WHY DANNY MIGHT HAVE.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.996
I KNEW YOU HAD
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE.

08:45.996 --> 08:47.998
IF I COULD JUST SEE
THAT PHOTO--

08:47.998 --> 08:50.601
SINCE YOU AND DANNY
HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE,

08:50.601 --> 08:51.702
I CAN'T IMAGINE
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

08:51.702 --> 08:52.803
NO.

08:52.803 --> 08:54.665
BUT YOU HARASSING ME
IS BECOMING ONE.

08:54.665 --> 08:56.737
SO THE NEXT TIME
YOU WANT TO CHAT,

08:56.737 --> 08:58.108
CALL MY LAWYER FIRST.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.874
( school bell rings )

09:03.874 --> 09:06.016
( murmuring )

09:08.919 --> 09:10.851
HEY, WHERE WERE YOU?
CLASS IS ABOUT TO START.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.322
ELOISE IS
GETTING WORRIED.

09:13.924 --> 09:16.026
CALM DOWN.
I DECIDED TO WALK.

09:16.026 --> 09:18.128
WHY? IS YOUR DAD'S
CAR BROKEN?

09:18.128 --> 09:20.030
DO I HAVE TO DRIVE TO SCHOOL
WITH MY DAD EVERYDAY?

09:20.030 --> 09:23.063
NO, WOW, WALKING
MAKES YOU GRUMPY.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.836
Miss Moseley: BEFORE WE
DIVE INTO TODAY'S EXPERIMENT,

09:25.836 --> 09:28.098
JANA HAS REQUESTED
TO CHANGE LAB GROUPS.

09:28.098 --> 09:30.570
MISS MOSELEY, PLEASE
WARN WHOEVER VOLUNTEERS

09:30.570 --> 09:32.643
THAT MY GROUP IS EVIL.
TELL THEM THAT SCOTT

09:32.643 --> 09:35.105
IS A COLD HEARTLESS ANIMAL
WHO WILL USE THEM AND TOSS

09:35.105 --> 09:36.847
THEM ASIDE LIKE GARBAGE.

09:36.847 --> 09:38.809
COME ON, JANA,
IT WAS ONE NIGHT.

09:38.809 --> 09:40.050
YOU SAID YOU'D CALL!

09:40.050 --> 09:41.952
Miss Moseley: WELL...

09:41.952 --> 09:43.684
ANYONE WANT TO SWITCH?

09:45.215 --> 09:47.357
ANYONE?

09:47.357 --> 09:49.790
MISS MOSELEY,

09:49.790 --> 09:51.792
I'LL DO IT.
I'LL SWITCH GROUPS.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.193
( whispering )

10:14.945 --> 10:16.947
I MEAN WHO ASKS
A GIRL FOR A RIDE

10:16.947 --> 10:18.849
WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE A CAR
IF THEY DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE HER?

10:18.849 --> 10:20.921
HELLO, MIXED SIGNALS,
HOW ARE YOU?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.723
UH, WILL YOU EXCUSE ME,
PLEASE,

10:22.723 --> 10:23.824
FOR A SECOND.

10:26.957 --> 10:27.998
( coughs )

10:39.069 --> 10:41.842
WELL, DO YOU CARE
TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF?

10:41.842 --> 10:43.814
YOU KNOW YOU COULD
ACTUALLY

10:43.814 --> 10:45.315
JUST SHARPEN THAT THING
FOR REAL.

10:45.315 --> 10:48.178
COME ON, RICO.

10:48.178 --> 10:50.350
IT CAN'T HURT US TO LIKE
SPREAD OUR WINGS A LITTLE.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.253
NOW, I'M GETTING TO KNOW
SCOTT AND SARITA

10:53.253 --> 10:55.786
AND YOU'RE GETTING
TO KNOW JANA.

10:55.786 --> 10:57.087
OH RIGHT, YEAH.
I'M GETTING TO KNOW JANA.

10:57.087 --> 10:58.328
SHE WON'T SHUT UP.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.260
I EVEN KNOW WHAT FREAKING
BIRTH CONTROL SHE USES.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.291
YOU HAVE ME DOING CHEMISTRY

11:01.291 --> 11:02.993
WITH SOMEONE WHO
USES BIRTH CONTROL.

11:02.993 --> 11:04.865
LOOK, IT WAS AN IMPULSIVE
DECISION, OKAY.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.967
BUT WE CAN'T HELP DANNY

11:06.967 --> 11:09.870
IF ALL WE DO
IS STUDY AT THE DINER.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.242
SO WE'RE OFF
FOR TONIGHT THEN?

11:12.242 --> 11:13.774
OR COURSE WE'RE STILL
ON FOR TONIGHT.

11:21.852 --> 11:23.854
HEY, GUYS.

11:23.854 --> 11:27.017
SO WHERE WERE WE?

11:27.017 --> 11:28.318
HEY, JO.

11:28.318 --> 11:30.961
YOU WERE JUST GONNA TELL US
WHAT PSYCHO-SEX IS LIKE.

12:04.294 --> 12:05.725
CAN WE--

12:05.725 --> 12:06.797
CAN WE TALK FOR A SECOND?

12:06.797 --> 12:08.728
HEARD YOU GUYS
GOT A BIG GAME

12:08.728 --> 12:09.960
FRIDAY.
GO, GRIZZLIES.

12:13.403 --> 12:14.935
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

12:14.935 --> 12:17.337
I'M NOT TRYING
TO START A FIGHT.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.069
OKAY, I SWEAR.

12:19.069 --> 12:21.241
YOU KNOW,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.813
I USED TO PLAY
SOCCER GROWING UP.

12:22.813 --> 12:24.214
I EVEN PLAYED
A LITTLE BIT IN JUVIE.

12:24.214 --> 12:25.415
I DON'T THINK KICKING
A COFFEE CAN

12:25.415 --> 12:28.148
AROUND A JAIL YARD
COUNTS AS PLAYING SOCCER.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.950
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.082
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE

12:32.082 --> 12:33.884
TO BE FRIENDS, BUT...

12:33.884 --> 12:36.456
LACEY AND I,
WE GO WAY BACK.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.859
I KNEW IT WAS ABOUT LACEY.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.831
YOU'RE INTO HER,
AREN'T YOU?

12:40.831 --> 12:42.532
WHAT? NO.

12:42.532 --> 12:44.294
NO, THAT'S EXACTLY
MY POINT.

12:44.294 --> 12:46.967
- I WANT TO BE FRIENDS.
- SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.068
I KINDA THINK
THAT'S UP TO HER.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.099
DON'T YOU?

12:50.370 --> 12:51.802
LOOK, YOU GUYS SEEM

12:51.802 --> 12:53.804
LIKE A REALLY GREAT COUPLE.

12:53.804 --> 12:56.476
AND THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO

12:56.476 --> 12:58.348
IS MESS THAT UP.

12:58.348 --> 13:01.451
I GOT TO GET
BACK TO MY TEAM.

13:10.961 --> 13:12.792
SHE GOT IT SOMETIME
LAST SPRING.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.327
KNOW WHERE?

13:17.327 --> 13:18.899
WHO GAVE IT TO HER?

13:18.899 --> 13:20.971
DOES IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

13:20.971 --> 13:23.033
WE'RE NOT SURE.

13:23.033 --> 13:25.075
OKAY, LACEY,

13:25.075 --> 13:26.236
WALK ME THROUGH
THE REST OF THAT NIGHT.

13:26.236 --> 13:28.178
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
YOU LEFT THE PARTY?

13:28.178 --> 13:30.881
I SAW JO WALKING
WITH DANNY

13:30.881 --> 13:32.112
AND I KNEW SHE'D BEEN DRINKING

13:32.112 --> 13:33.513
SO I GAVE THEM A RIDE.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.446
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO
THANK YOU FOR THAT BY THE WAY.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.590
YEAH, WELL, THAT WAS IT.

13:40.590 --> 13:42.292
I DROPPED JO OFF THEN DANNY.

13:42.292 --> 13:44.124
THEN I WENT HOME, WENT TO BED.
THAT'S ALL.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.396
CAN ANYONE VOUCH FOR THAT?

13:49.259 --> 13:51.131
NO ONE WAS AWAKE
WHEN YOU GOT HOME?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.608
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME,

13:58.608 --> 14:00.610
RIGHT, LACEY?

14:05.145 --> 14:07.978
I KNEW JO WOULD TELL YOU
THAT I SPENT THE NIGHT.

14:07.978 --> 14:09.619
JO KNEW?

14:12.422 --> 14:13.583
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

14:13.583 --> 14:15.585
WHO TOLD ME ISN'T IMPORTANT.

14:19.029 --> 14:22.993
LOOK, DANNY CONVINCED ME
TO COME UPSTAIRS TO TALK.

14:22.993 --> 14:25.195
AND IT GOT LATE
AND I FELL ASLEEP.

14:25.195 --> 14:26.336
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

14:26.336 --> 14:29.039
WHAT TIME DID YOU FALL ASLEEP?

14:29.039 --> 14:31.071
( sighs ) UH, MIDNIGHT.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.502
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

14:32.502 --> 14:33.603
AND YOU WOKE UP AT?

14:33.603 --> 14:35.105
I WAS HOME AT
6:20 EXACTLY.

14:35.105 --> 14:36.306
I REMEMBER SEEING THE TIME
ON OUR GRANDFATHER CLOCK

14:36.306 --> 14:37.307
WHEN I WALKED IN.

14:37.307 --> 14:39.910
SO FROM MIDNIGHT
TO AROUND SIX--

14:39.910 --> 14:41.581
I WAS SOUND ASLEEP,
I SWEAR.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.883
OKAY, LACEY.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.955
YOU CAN GO NOW.

14:52.122 --> 14:54.024
I'M SORRY, CHIEF MASTERSON.

14:54.024 --> 14:55.966
IT'S JUST
IF ANYONE FOUND OUT--

14:55.966 --> 14:57.567
I UNDERSTAND.

14:57.567 --> 15:00.030
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO REGINA.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.331
I CAN'T DO THAT
IF HER FRIENDS

15:01.331 --> 15:03.033
LIE TO ME, OKAY.

15:09.079 --> 15:10.981
GOD, JANA'S POSTING

15:10.981 --> 15:12.682
MEAN STUFF ALL OVER
MY FACEBOOK PAGE.

15:12.682 --> 15:15.185
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS CRAY-CRAY.
YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME.

15:15.185 --> 15:16.586
ONE NIGHT!

15:16.586 --> 15:18.648
I HUNG OUT WITH HER
LITERALLY ONE NIGHT.

15:18.648 --> 15:22.552
IT'S LIKE SHE'S GIVING
MY SOUL AN STD.

15:22.552 --> 15:24.024
( laughs )

15:24.024 --> 15:25.055
Sarita: YUCK.

15:25.055 --> 15:26.696
LACEY JUST TEXTED ME.

15:26.696 --> 15:29.229
PHOEBE WANTS TO REHEARSE
AN EXTRA HOUR TONIGHT.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.401
YOU GUYS DOING THAT SKIT
FOR SOBRIETY AWARENESS DAY?

15:31.401 --> 15:32.932
MM-HMM.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.334
YEAH, I JUST WROTE
THAT STUPID

15:34.334 --> 15:36.706
ANTI-DRINKING ESSAY INSTEAD.
GOT IT OVER WITH.

15:36.706 --> 15:38.538
OF COURSE YOU DID.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.970
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

15:39.970 --> 15:41.641
WELL, YOU'RE A MOLE PERSON.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.975
MOLE PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY
TAKE PART IN LIFE ABOVE GROUND.

15:47.717 --> 15:50.720
SO WHAT? YOU GUYS JUST
GONNA PERFORM A SKIT

15:50.720 --> 15:53.223
ON THE DANGERS OF DRINKING?

15:53.223 --> 15:55.725
- COULD BE KIND OF FUN.
- YEAH, IT'S NOT.

15:55.725 --> 15:57.127
BUT MAYBE YOU'LL
LEARN SOMETHING.

15:57.127 --> 15:58.989
YOU KNOW AFTER YOUR
HUNG-OVER DECISION

15:58.989 --> 16:01.661
TO DEFEND THE SOCIO
TO THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.333
( bell rings )

16:10.570 --> 16:12.642
( murmuring )

16:14.674 --> 16:16.646
HEY!

16:16.646 --> 16:18.008
WHERE'RE YOU COMING FROM?

16:18.008 --> 16:19.579
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.311
YOU KNOW, I BUMPED INTO
YOUR BOYFRIEND EARLIER.

16:21.311 --> 16:22.482
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE READY TO START

16:22.482 --> 16:23.753
BRAIDING EACH OTHER'S HAIR
JUST YET,

16:23.753 --> 16:25.615
BUT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
KICKING OR PUNCHING.

16:25.615 --> 16:28.318
DID I DO SOMETHING
TO UPSET YOU

16:28.318 --> 16:29.989
- IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS?
- YOU TELL ME!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.691
I JUST GAVE MY STATEMENT
TO CHIEF MASTERSON.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.693
OH, WELL, HOW'D IT GO?

16:33.693 --> 16:34.724
YOU CAN DROP THE ACT,

16:34.724 --> 16:36.596
DANNY, IT'S OVER.
HE KNEW EVERYTHING.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.168
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

16:38.168 --> 16:39.499
HE KNEW, HOW?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.600
HE DIDN'T HEAR IT
FROM JO.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.002
IT MUST'VE BEEN
MY MOM THEN.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.405
- RIGHT.
- NO, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.476
LACEY, I WOULD
NEVER DO THAT.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.178
STOP.
JUST STOP IT.

16:48.178 --> 16:50.210
I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.741
JUST STAY THE HELL
OUT OF MY LIFE.

17:03.593 --> 17:06.025
JO, I'M TELLING YOU.
SHE WAS REALLY ANGRY
WITH ME.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.198
WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
WASN'T SHE ALWAYS

17:08.198 --> 17:09.229
THE EASYGOING ONE?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.260
A LOT'S CHANGED
IN FIVE YEARS.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.031
SO I'M LEARNING.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.034
ALTHOUGH MY MOTHER
CERTAINLY HASN'T CHANGED.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.236
STILL SCREWING UP
MY LIFE,

17:16.236 --> 17:17.667
BUT IN FRESH, NEW,
INTERESTING WAYS.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.170
SO THE DANNY DESAI
CHARM OFFENSIVE

17:20.170 --> 17:21.611
IS OVER ALREADY, HUH?

17:21.611 --> 17:23.173
YOU DIDN'T WITNESS
HER RAGE, JO.

17:23.173 --> 17:25.175
CHARM IS NOT GONNA CUT IT.

17:25.175 --> 17:28.047
OKAY, SO TRY
A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.750
BE MORE REAL.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.152
HONEST.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.224
APPEAL TO HER EMOTIONS.
WORKED ON ME.

17:34.224 --> 17:35.755
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE MORE
OPEN-MINDED.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.527
AND HOW CAN I BE
HONEST WITH LACEY

17:37.527 --> 17:38.558
IF I CAN'T EVEN
GET NEAR HER?

17:44.194 --> 17:45.395
HOW ABOUT THIS?

17:46.366 --> 17:47.597
WHAT ABOUT IT?

17:47.597 --> 17:48.798
I HEARD LACEY'S INVOLVED.

17:48.798 --> 17:50.840
BET YOU THEY
COULD USE MORE HELP.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.843
I'M SURE LACEY
WOULD BE THRILLED.

17:53.843 --> 17:55.575
COME ON,
I'LL DO IT WITH YOU.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.607
COULD EVEN BE
SORT OF FUN.

17:59.109 --> 18:00.550
WHAT?

18:00.550 --> 18:02.182
SOMEONE'S A JOINER
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.614
AND SOMEONE'S A QUITTER.

18:04.614 --> 18:06.556
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
GIVE UP SO FAST?

18:11.361 --> 18:13.623
SO SARITA, TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER.

18:13.623 --> 18:16.196
- WHO IS SHE?
- A BITCH WHO LIKES ALCOHOL.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.367
OKAY.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.599
BUT WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.531
FOR THIS CONVERSATION
TO BE OVER.

18:21.531 --> 18:23.173
THIS CONVERSATION
WILL BE OVER

18:23.173 --> 18:24.604
ONCE YOU START TO SHOW
SOME APPRECIATION

18:24.604 --> 18:25.605
FOR THE IMPORTANCE
OF WHAT WE'RE DOING.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.337
PHOEBE,
LET'S JUST REHEARSE.

18:27.337 --> 18:28.708
OKAY?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.440
( door closes )

18:30.440 --> 18:32.182
THIS IS A PRIVATE REHEARSAL!

18:32.182 --> 18:33.483
WE WANTED
TO VOLUNTEER.

18:33.483 --> 18:35.685
- ACTUALLY.
- THANKS, WE'RE GOOD.

18:35.685 --> 18:37.217
BYE NOW.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.588
LOOK, WE DO NEED MORE PEOPLE
ON CREW.

18:38.588 --> 18:40.320
AND TECHNICALLY,

18:40.320 --> 18:42.152
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TURN AWAY VOLUNTEERS

18:42.152 --> 18:43.893
FOR A SCHOOL-SPONSORED EVENT.

18:43.893 --> 18:45.625
EVEN SUSPECTED MURDERERS.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.327
SUSPECTED?

18:49.859 --> 18:51.231
WE NEED MORE HELP ON A.V.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.502
THERE'S AN ANTI-DRINKING VIDEO

18:52.502 --> 18:54.204
THAT RUNS POST SKIT
WHEN THE SCHOOL

18:54.204 --> 18:55.905
IS FEELING ALL
RAW AND EXPOSED.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.169
YEAH, WHATEVER,
JUST FIND DOUG.

18:59.169 --> 19:01.140
HE'LL EXPLAIN.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.472
OKAY, WHAT PART OF
STAY OUT OF MY LIFE

19:02.472 --> 19:04.143
WAS CONFUSING TO YOU?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.176
- IT WAS MY IDEA.
- IT'S TRUE.

19:06.176 --> 19:07.647
BUT NOW THAT I'M HERE,
I'M VERY EXCITED.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.849
TEENAGE SOBRIETY

19:09.849 --> 19:11.381
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A PET CAUSE OF MINE.

19:11.381 --> 19:12.882
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

19:12.882 --> 19:14.884
AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

19:17.687 --> 19:19.459
LESS CHARM,
MORE EMOTION, RIGHT?

19:25.595 --> 19:26.696
HEY.

19:26.696 --> 19:27.897
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET NEAR LACEY

19:27.897 --> 19:29.269
WHEN YOU THINK I'M NOT AROUND?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.571
NO, NO.
I'M JUST BEING A JOINER.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.703
I KNEW THAT LITTLE SPEECH
IN THE STUDENT LOUNGE

19:33.703 --> 19:34.804
WAS TOTAL B.S.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.850
HEY, BEEN RESEARCHING TARA;
LOOKING FOR PICTURES ONLINE.

19:40.850 --> 19:41.881
NOTHING MUCH THERE.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.182
I ALSO PULLED HER FILE.

19:47.857 --> 19:49.959
A NECKLACE?

19:49.959 --> 19:51.361
SHE HAD A NECKLACE
IN HER POSSESSION

19:51.361 --> 19:53.192
- WHEN DANNY...
- I KNEW YOU'D LATCH ON TO THAT.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.594
IS IT IN THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS?

19:54.594 --> 19:55.895
NO, IT WAS IN HER PURSE
WHEN SHE DIED.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.827
COME ON, BOSS.
LOTS OF WOMEN

19:57.827 --> 19:59.929
WEAR LOTS OF NECKLACES.
THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY--

19:59.929 --> 20:02.572
I KNOW, BUT IT WOULD
EXPLAIN SO MUCH.

20:02.572 --> 20:04.234
WHY ELSE WOULD DANNY
MOVE THE PHOTO?

20:04.234 --> 20:05.905
WHY DID KAREN REACT
THE WAY SHE DID

20:05.905 --> 20:07.277
WHEN I SHOWED HER
THE PICTURE OF THE NECKLACE?

20:07.277 --> 20:08.708
IT WAS TARA'S NECKLACE.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.710
AND WITHOUT PROOF,
IT'S JUST A THEORY.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.211
WE HAVE TO SEE
THAT PHOTO OF TARA.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.884
UNLESS YOU'VE CONQUERED
THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM,

20:14.884 --> 20:16.546
THERE'S NO WAY
TO SEE IT ANYMORE.

20:16.546 --> 20:18.348
IT'S GONE.
PROBABLY DESTROYED.

20:18.348 --> 20:20.219
WHAT IF WE COULD
GO BACK IN TIME?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.391
THE DESAI HOUSE

20:21.391 --> 20:22.652
WAS ON THE MARKET
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

20:22.652 --> 20:23.923
THAT REALTOR MUST
HAVE PHOTOGRAPHED

20:23.923 --> 20:25.655
EVERY ROOM, EVERY CORNER,
EVERY LAMP.

20:25.655 --> 20:26.926
EVERY PHOTO.

20:26.926 --> 20:27.997
I'LL TRACK HIM DOWN.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.232
FROM BACK HERE,
LACEY'S ABOUT...

20:33.232 --> 20:35.004
- TWO INCHES TALL.
- Doug: OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA

20:35.004 --> 20:36.566
GO BACKSTAGE AND GET SOME

20:36.566 --> 20:37.737
- FRESH BATTERIES.
- I'LL GET THEM.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.309
NO! NO.

20:39.309 --> 20:41.741
THAT'S-- DON'T--
YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.742
AND IT'S FINE.
I CAN--

20:42.742 --> 20:44.243
- GET THEM.
- IT'S FINE.

20:44.243 --> 20:44.974
- I REALLY WANT TO HELP.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, REALLY.

20:44.974 --> 20:46.446
- IT'S FINE. I GOT IT.
- DOUG.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.548
I'M IN CHARGE AND I NEED
TO MAINTAIN THAT CONTROL.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.880
REALLY? OKAY.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.252
( shakily ) OKAY.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.286
- SO, DOUG...
- YEAH.

20:56.286 --> 20:57.927
YOU GROW UP IN GREEN GROVE?
YOU A LIFER?

20:57.927 --> 21:00.930
I NEED TO GO URINATE NOW.

21:05.535 --> 21:07.497
JANA JUST TEXTED
ASKING FOR UGLY

21:07.497 --> 21:08.698
PHOTOS OF YOU
TO POST ONLINE.

21:08.698 --> 21:10.970
I'M SENDING HER ONE OF YOU
EATING A BURRITO.

21:12.602 --> 21:14.003
I HATE YOU.

21:14.003 --> 21:15.445
IF YOU HADN'T BORROWED MY CAR
ALL FREAKING NIGHT,

21:15.445 --> 21:16.706
I WOULDN'T HAD
TO RIDE WITH HER.

21:16.706 --> 21:18.908
YOU OWE ME A TANK
OF GAS BY THE WAY.

21:18.908 --> 21:20.480
( lid slams )

21:20.480 --> 21:22.352
DOUG TOLD ME
TO LOOK FOR BATTERIES.

21:22.352 --> 21:23.913
SHE'S DOING THIS THING?

21:23.913 --> 21:25.715
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

21:25.715 --> 21:27.417
HER AND THE FREAK
ARE HELPING OUT.

21:27.417 --> 21:28.988
ARCHIE, HI.

21:28.988 --> 21:29.989
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I TOLD YOU

21:29.989 --> 21:31.661
TO REDO YOUR ENTRANCE.

21:31.661 --> 21:32.862
I'M TALKING TO MY FRIEND.
JUST CHILL, OKAY?

21:32.862 --> 21:35.595
DID YOU JUST TELL ME TO CHILL?

21:35.595 --> 21:37.827
YES.
CHILL OUT.

21:37.827 --> 21:39.499
YOU'RE INSANE, OKAY.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.832
CAN WE TAKE A 15-MINUTE BREAK
OR LIKE AN HOUR?

21:42.832 --> 21:45.475
DOES ANYONE UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

21:45.475 --> 21:47.076
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL

21:47.076 --> 21:48.978
IS ABOUT TO WATCH YOU
MAKE FOOLS OF YOURSELVES.

21:48.978 --> 21:52.482
- PHOEBE, IT'LL BE OKAY.
- YEAH, I JUST TWEETED

21:52.482 --> 21:53.943
THAT THIS THING
IS GONNA BE AWFUL.

21:53.943 --> 21:56.986
LOWERING EXPECTATIONS, DUH.

21:56.986 --> 21:58.918
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.089
WE'LL JUST FIGURE
THIS OUT TOMORROW.

22:00.089 --> 22:02.091
OR WE WON'T 'CAUSE
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

22:02.091 --> 22:04.854
SO I'M JUST GONNA BE
IN THE LOUNGE NOT CARING

22:04.854 --> 22:06.526
IF ANYONE WANTS
TO COME APOLOGIZE.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.706
HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT I THINK
SARITA'S GOT A POINT.

22:16.706 --> 22:18.568
THIS SKIT IS BEYOND LAME.

22:18.568 --> 22:19.969
I THINK IT ACTUALLY
MAKES ME WANT TO DRINK MORE

22:19.969 --> 22:21.040
JUST TO DEFY IT.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.772
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:22.772 --> 22:24.444
I COULD PROBABLY WRITE
A BETTER SCRIPT THAN THIS.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.447
CAN I BORROW YOUR LAPTOP?

22:27.447 --> 22:31.381
YEAH, IT'S OKAY.
A LITTLE HEAVY.

22:31.381 --> 22:33.082
I DREW FROM
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

22:33.082 --> 22:34.524
THE BEST WRITING IS HONEST,
RIGHT?

22:34.524 --> 22:37.487
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
DOING THIS?

22:37.487 --> 22:38.888
WE JUST WANT TO HELP OUT.

22:38.888 --> 22:41.360
MAYBE BE MORE INVOLVED.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.492
INVOLVED HOW?

22:42.492 --> 22:44.894
WITHIN TEN FEET
OF THE STAGE.

22:44.894 --> 22:46.896
I COULD HELP YOU DIRECT.

22:46.896 --> 22:49.038
LIKE I TOOK AN EXCLUSIVE
YOUTH DIRECTING COURSE

22:49.038 --> 22:51.070
AT THE ST. ATHENS
SUMMER THEATER FESTIVAL

22:51.070 --> 22:52.802
SO I COULD DIRECT
WITH AN EX-CONVICT.

22:54.504 --> 22:56.906
I GUESS YOU CAN BE
MY ASSISTANT.

22:57.947 --> 22:59.709
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

23:01.751 --> 23:03.953
I WANT THE LEAD ROLE.

23:14.163 --> 23:16.526
GOSH, I HAVEN'T ACTED
SINCE LIKE THE 4th GRADE.

23:16.526 --> 23:19.529
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT PLAY
OUR CLASS DID ON PHOTOSYNTHESIS?

23:19.529 --> 23:21.831
I WAS SUCH
A KICK-ASS LEAF.

23:21.831 --> 23:23.773
I WAS THE SUN.

23:23.773 --> 23:26.506
IT WAS MY FINEST HOUR.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.677
YEAH, IT WAS.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.539
WASN'T LACEY
LIKE A RAINDROP?

23:29.539 --> 23:31.641
HEY,

23:31.641 --> 23:33.412
DO YOU REALLY THINK
READING THIS THING

23:33.412 --> 23:34.914
WILL HAVE ANY EFFECT ON HER?

23:34.914 --> 23:37.186
LIKE YOU SAID,
HONESTY OVER CHARM.

23:37.186 --> 23:39.048
IT AFFECTED ME.

23:39.048 --> 23:41.891
AND I PROMISE I WILL PERFORM
THE HELL OUT OF IT.

23:41.891 --> 23:43.623
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

23:44.654 --> 23:47.527
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
ANYWAY?

23:47.527 --> 23:49.659
COME ON.

23:49.659 --> 23:52.101
STARRING IN
A SCHOOL ASSEMBLY?

23:52.101 --> 23:53.563
TWO DAYS AGO YOU WOULD
HAVE MOCKED THAT IDEA.

23:53.563 --> 23:54.704
NO, I WOULDN'T HAVE.

23:54.704 --> 23:57.507
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
OUR CONVERSATION

23:57.507 --> 23:58.538
LAST NIGHT, IS IT?

23:58.538 --> 23:59.909
I DIDN'T MEAN

23:59.909 --> 24:00.910
TO MAKE YOU FEEL
SELF-CONSCIENCE.

24:00.910 --> 24:02.542
YOU DIDN'T.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.845
OKAY, MAYBE YOU DID
LIKE A LITTLE BIT.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.578
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

24:08.578 --> 24:11.651
I MEAN YOU ONLY
GO THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ONCE.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.554
WHO WANTS TO GET
TO THE END OF IT
WITH A PERFECT GPA

24:14.554 --> 24:17.587
WHEN NO ONE KNOWS
WHO YOU REALLY ARE?

24:17.587 --> 24:19.659
I THINK PEOPLE
KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

24:19.659 --> 24:24.594
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH GETTING GOOD GRADES.

24:24.594 --> 24:26.195
I KNOW.

24:26.195 --> 24:30.099
DO YOU WANT
TO READ LINES WITH ME?

24:30.099 --> 24:31.470
AREN'T YOU MEETING RICO
TO STUDY?

24:31.470 --> 24:32.602
OH CRAP!

24:32.602 --> 24:34.203
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

24:34.203 --> 24:35.605
YEAH, I GOT TO RUN.

24:35.605 --> 24:36.806
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

24:40.910 --> 24:43.052
- HEY, HONEY.
- HEY.

24:44.754 --> 24:46.085
SOMEONE'S IN A GOOD MOOD.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.957
WE GOT A STRONG LEAD
ON THE CASE.

24:47.957 --> 24:49.488
WE'LL FIND OUT TOMORROW.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.921
WHAT HAPPENED TO NEVER TALKING
ABOUT YOUR CASES WITH ME?

24:51.921 --> 24:53.963
"STRONG LEAD"
IS PRETTY VAGUE.

24:53.963 --> 24:56.495
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.628
I HAD PLANS

24:58.628 --> 25:00.600
WITH THIS REALLY CUTE GUY
I KINDA LIKE,

25:00.600 --> 25:03.132
BUT HE STOOD ME UP.

25:03.132 --> 25:06.275
THE GARAGE, I COMPLETELY FORGOT.
LET ME JUST RUN UPSTAIRS.

25:06.275 --> 25:07.677
I'LL GET CHANGED.
WE'LL DO IT RIGHT NOW.

25:07.677 --> 25:09.278
IT'S LATE, KYLE.

25:09.278 --> 25:10.640
AND IT'S A REALLY BIG JOB.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.041
IT'S FINE.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.643
WE'LL DO IT TOMORROW NIGHT.

25:13.643 --> 25:16.285
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT TILL

25:16.285 --> 25:18.517
THE WEEKEND 'CAUSE
THE CASE IS REALLY--

25:18.517 --> 25:20.289
HEATING UP.

25:20.289 --> 25:21.591
I KNOW.

25:21.591 --> 25:23.553
IT'S FINE.

25:23.553 --> 25:24.594
I'M REALLY SORRY.

25:24.594 --> 25:26.295
IT'S OKAY.

25:26.295 --> 25:28.628
I KNOW HOW YOU GET
ON A BIG CASE.

25:39.068 --> 25:40.539
( door slams shut )

25:43.613 --> 25:46.315
DRINKING ALONE, MOTHER?

25:46.315 --> 25:48.277
IT'S ONLY MY SECOND GLASS.

25:48.277 --> 25:49.979
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

25:49.979 --> 25:52.181
WELL, PEOPLE ARE JUST
STEPPING OVER EACH OTHER

25:52.181 --> 25:53.823
WANTING TO HANG OUT
WITH ME.

25:53.823 --> 25:55.554
HOMECOMING KING,
HERE I COME.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.326
SARCASM DOESN'T WIN FRIENDS,
DANNY.

25:57.326 --> 25:58.928
JUST KEEP TRYING.

25:58.928 --> 26:00.129
I AM TRYING.

26:00.129 --> 26:01.731
NOT THAT YOU'RE HELPING.

26:01.731 --> 26:04.934
DID YOU MOVE A PHOTO
FROM THE DINING ROOM?

26:07.997 --> 26:10.199
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:10.199 --> 26:12.672
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.604
THERE WAS A FAMILY PHOTO

26:14.604 --> 26:17.677
IN THE DINING ROOM
AND IT'S GONE NOW.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.779
TARA WAS IN IT.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.251
WELL, I DIDN'T MOVE IT.

26:22.251 --> 26:23.783
AND NEITHER DID I.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.255
AND WE'RE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE
WHO LIVE HERE.

26:26.255 --> 26:28.317
I'M VERY AWARE OF THAT,
MOTHER.

26:28.317 --> 26:31.290
AND SINCE WE'RE GRILLING
ONE ANOTHER,

26:31.290 --> 26:34.063
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW CHIEF MASTERSON KNEW

26:34.063 --> 26:36.225
ABOUT LACEY SPENDING
THE NIGHT HERE?

26:36.225 --> 26:38.798
SHE'S NOT MY CHILD, DANNY.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.070
BUT SHE'S MY FRIEND,

26:41.070 --> 26:43.602
AT LEAST I'M TRYING
TO CONVINCE HER TO BE.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.935
NOT THAT THAT'S VERY LIKELY
NOW THAT YOU'VE INTERVENED,

26:45.935 --> 26:47.907
WHICH I SPECIFICALLY
ASKED YOU NOT TO DO.

26:47.907 --> 26:50.940
I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

26:50.940 --> 26:52.341
I DON'T NEED YOUR PROTECTION!

27:02.692 --> 27:04.323
HEY.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.755
SORRY I'M LATE.

27:06.756 --> 27:08.397
GUESS WHO'S NOW STARRING

27:08.397 --> 27:11.030
IN THE BIG ANTI-DRINKING
ASSEMBLY.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.802
I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU WOULDN'T BE TELLING ME

27:12.802 --> 27:14.203
UNLESS IT WAS YOU.

27:14.203 --> 27:15.805
RIGHT.
SO WOULD YOU MIND QUICKLY

27:15.805 --> 27:16.966
RUNNING LINES WITH ME
BEFORE WE JUMP

27:16.966 --> 27:18.207
INTO OUR HISTORY HOMEWORK?

27:18.207 --> 27:20.069
ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

27:20.069 --> 27:23.843
OH, OKAY, YOU'RE MAD.
I GET IT.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.675
BUT THIS SKIT IS TOMORROW

27:25.675 --> 27:26.716
SO DANNY AND I
JUST REALLY HAD TO--

27:26.716 --> 27:27.817
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S FINE, JO.

27:27.817 --> 27:30.750
OKAY, IT'S VERY GOOD
AND FINE AND OKAY.

27:30.750 --> 27:31.781
OKAY.

27:31.781 --> 27:35.124
IT DOESN'T SEEM FINE.

27:35.124 --> 27:37.326
YOU'RE DOING THAT WEIRD
TWITCHING THING WITH YOUR MOUTH.

27:37.326 --> 27:40.329
I ATE A BLUEBERRY MUFFIN
AND HAD LOTS OF SUGAR.

27:40.329 --> 27:41.931
OKAY, JUST LAY OFF ME.

27:41.931 --> 27:44.163
COME ON, I CAN'T
BE LATE ONE TIME?

27:44.163 --> 27:46.295
LOOK, I'M SORRY YOU'RE
BORED WITH STUDYING
WITH ME OR WHATEVER.

27:46.295 --> 27:47.666
I'M NOT BORED.

27:48.698 --> 27:50.199
BORED IS SUCH A HARSH WORD.

27:50.199 --> 27:53.703
YOU KNOW WHAT, GO STAR IN SKITS,
AND STUDY WITH MORONS,

27:53.703 --> 27:54.874
AND BE ALL INVOLVED
IN THE SCHOOL.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.005
WHATEVER, I CAN GET
GOOD GRADES ON MY OWN.

27:56.005 --> 27:58.077
- RICO--
- I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT

27:58.077 --> 27:59.709
WE CARED ABOUT
THE SAME THINGS.

27:59.709 --> 28:02.381
WE DO.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.383
AND WE CAN STILL STUDY
IT'S NOT THAT LATE.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.716
I'M TIRED.

28:06.716 --> 28:08.187
I'M GOING HOME.

28:20.229 --> 28:23.432
EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH YOUR NEW PART?

28:23.432 --> 28:25.835
IT'S FINE.

28:25.835 --> 28:29.478
IT'S BETTER, ACTUALLY--
THE SKIT.

28:29.478 --> 28:30.780
DANNY REALLY WROTE IT?

28:30.780 --> 28:34.313
YEAH, HE'S REALLY TRYING,
LACEY.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.786
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

28:49.298 --> 28:52.001
Sarita: OKAY,
WHY DOES MY SCRIPT HAVE
DIFFERENT WORDS ON IT?

28:52.001 --> 28:53.903
AND WHY'D YOU CHANGE
MY CHARACTER'S NAME?

28:53.903 --> 28:55.835
SORRY, WE WROTE
YOUR CHARACTER OUT.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.106
IT'S LACEY, ARCHIE,
AND JO NOW.

28:57.106 --> 28:58.507
YOU'RE KIDDING.

28:58.507 --> 29:00.870
I ASSUMED YOU DIDN'T CARE.
YOU DIDN'T SEEM THAT INTO IT.

29:00.870 --> 29:02.942
Phoebe: BUT WE STILL
REALLY NEED YOU

29:02.942 --> 29:05.044
ON A.V. WITH
THE ANTI-DRINKING VIDEO.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.916
PLEASE GO SEE DOUG NOW.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.123
HEY, HOPE YOU LIKE
THE NEW SCRIPT.

29:14.123 --> 29:15.284
SORRY ABOUT THE SURPRISE.

29:15.284 --> 29:18.027
OH, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

29:18.027 --> 29:19.889
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:19.889 --> 29:22.331
YOU MANIPULATE OTHER PEOPLE
TO MAKE THEM LIKE YOU

29:22.331 --> 29:23.762
SO THAT YOU CAN
GET WHAT YOU WANT.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.234
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

29:25.234 --> 29:26.866
YOU'RE A SOCIOPATH.

29:42.311 --> 29:44.113
HEY, BOSS.

29:44.113 --> 29:46.455
GUESS WHAT BICKNER REALTY
FINALLY JUST SENT OVER.

29:49.318 --> 29:51.560
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT.

29:53.522 --> 29:55.464
NO.

29:55.464 --> 29:56.565
NO.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.298
THAT'S WHERE IT WAS.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.573
THESE ARE THEIR
PERSONAL PHOTOS?

30:04.573 --> 30:07.436
THAT'S NOT THEM.

30:07.436 --> 30:10.139
THEY STAGED THE HOUSE.

30:19.548 --> 30:22.391
HEY,
I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

30:22.391 --> 30:24.353
IT'S MANDATORY.

30:24.353 --> 30:26.555
LOOK,

30:26.555 --> 30:28.998
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL MAD.

30:28.998 --> 30:31.430
I JUST WANT TO SAY

30:31.430 --> 30:33.032
I COULD NEVER
GET BORED OF YOU.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.464
OKAY?
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

30:35.464 --> 30:37.907
BREAK A LEG.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.577
JUST TRY SAYING IT
WITH MORE PASSION.

30:48.577 --> 30:49.848
IT WON'T MATTER.
THE LINE'S DUMB.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.480
JUST DO IT, ARCHIE.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.581
IT'S TWO MINUTES
UNTIL CURTAIN.

30:52.581 --> 30:53.983
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
DO THE OLD SKIT?

30:53.983 --> 30:56.185
THAT ONE AT LEAST MADE SENSE.
DON'T DRINK.

30:56.185 --> 30:57.526
IT'S BAD.

30:57.526 --> 30:58.557
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THIS ONE'S ABOUT!

30:58.557 --> 31:00.189
IT'S ABOUT FORGIVENESS.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.432
HAVEN'T YOU EVER WANTED

31:03.432 --> 31:05.164
SOMEONE'S FORGIVENESS
REALLY BADLY?

31:09.638 --> 31:10.970
YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:10.970 --> 31:13.903
- SCREW THIS.
- ARCHIE, COME ON.

31:13.903 --> 31:15.975
NO, I'M GONNA WRITE
THE ANTI-DRINKING ESSAY.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.576
I DON'T CARE.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.408
I NOT READING SOMETHING
THIS FREAK SHOW WROTE.

31:19.408 --> 31:21.010
Phoebe: OH MY GOD.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.011
OH MY GOD.

31:22.011 --> 31:23.582
IT'S FINE.
SETTLE.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.583
IT'LL BE OKAY.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.216
DANNY CAN JUST DO IT.

31:28.557 --> 31:30.359
YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.
HE KNOWS ALL THE LINES.

31:30.359 --> 31:32.491
YES, DANNY.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.623
DANNY CAN DO IT.

31:34.623 --> 31:36.495
GOOD.
PLACES EVERYONE.

31:39.428 --> 31:40.970
YOU DO KNOW YOUR LINES,
RIGHT?

31:40.970 --> 31:43.372
- I THINK I'LL MANAGE.
- GREAT.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.086
( boo's and jeering )

31:57.086 --> 31:58.447
- FREAK!
- SHH!

31:58.447 --> 31:59.488
HEY, ENOUGH OF THAT.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.129
IT WAS JUST ANOTHER NIGHT.

32:10.129 --> 32:13.132
I CAN STILL SMELL
WHAT IT SMELLED LIKE,

32:13.132 --> 32:16.205
DRY LEAVES OR SOMETHING.

32:16.205 --> 32:19.608
THE PARTY WAS SUPPOSED
TO START AT 10:00.

32:19.608 --> 32:22.411
EVERYONE WAS OVER
AT MY HOUSE

32:22.411 --> 32:24.043
BEFOREHAND
FOR A COUPLE OF DRINKS.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.045
A COUPLE?

32:26.045 --> 32:28.277
OKAY A FEW.

32:28.277 --> 32:29.548
WE HAD A FEW.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.480
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.382
I KNEW YOU HAD TOO MANY,
I TOLD YOU.

32:33.382 --> 32:36.555
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.
I COULDN'T.

32:36.555 --> 32:39.228
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE, RIGHT?

32:39.228 --> 32:42.031
THE DISCOMFORT,
THE ANXIETY,

32:42.031 --> 32:45.434
SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER
TO GO TO A PARTY

32:45.434 --> 32:47.436
( fading out)
WITH A LITTLE LIQUID COURAGE.

32:47.436 --> 32:49.438
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL.

32:49.438 --> 32:51.270
I CAN STILL HEAR
THE THUD WHEN WE
HIT HIM.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.002
THE BROKEN WINDSHIELD--

32:53.002 --> 32:55.574
I CAN'T CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.407
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.

32:58.407 --> 32:59.978
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT TOO.

33:02.251 --> 33:04.083
ME TOO.

33:06.415 --> 33:09.318
I JUST WANT TO FORGET.

33:09.318 --> 33:12.221
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
BE ABLE TO FORGET.

33:12.221 --> 33:14.223
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
TRY AND FORGIVE.

33:22.531 --> 33:25.234
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED.

33:25.234 --> 33:28.507
BUT WE CAN LEARN
FROM IT.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.210
TALK ABOUT IT.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.613
IT'S ALL
WE CAN DO NOW.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.585
( applause )

33:46.055 --> 33:48.257
THAT WAS JUST-- WOW.

33:48.257 --> 33:49.428
AM I RIGHT?

33:51.560 --> 33:53.502
OKAY.

33:53.502 --> 33:56.034
NOW FOR A SHORT P.S.A. VIDEO

33:56.034 --> 33:58.307
ON THE DANGERS
OF BINGE DRINKING.

34:00.439 --> 34:03.612
Jo: I know that we're all
scared and sad

34:03.612 --> 34:05.614
and angry.

34:05.614 --> 34:08.717
And it's easy to focus
all of that

34:08.717 --> 34:10.579
on the obvious--

34:10.579 --> 34:12.251
( scratched mix )
♪ Sa-sa-sa ♪

34:12.251 --> 34:14.483

( cheering continues )

35:08.207 --> 35:09.678
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

35:09.678 --> 35:11.740
IT WAS PRETTY EASY, ACTUALLY.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.282
SO MANY PEOPLE RECORDED
ALL THAT STUFF

35:13.282 --> 35:15.584
WITH THEIR PHONES.
I JUST GATHERED UP
A FEW NERDS.

35:15.584 --> 35:17.216
THROUGH IT TOGETHER.
TOOK ME AN HOUR.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.747
IT WAS CRUEL, SARITA.

35:18.747 --> 35:20.589
TO WHO? TO JO?

35:20.589 --> 35:23.121
THE GIRL HANGING OUT
WITH OUR BEST FRIEND'S
KILLER?

35:23.121 --> 35:25.554
- REGINA WOULD HAVE LOVED IT.
- NOT THE REGINA I KNEW.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.232
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.304
WAS THAT JO?

35:36.765 --> 35:37.906
HOW IS SHE?

35:37.906 --> 35:40.339
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.371
I HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH THAT VIDEO
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

35:42.371 --> 35:43.512
I KNOW.

35:43.512 --> 35:45.314
COULD YOU PLEASE
TELL JO THAT FOR ME?

35:45.314 --> 35:46.775
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HER YOURSELF?

35:46.775 --> 35:51.180
YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S THAT SIMPLE, DON'T YOU?

35:51.180 --> 35:52.881
ONE DRUNK-DRIVING SKIT
AND THE THREE OF US

35:52.881 --> 35:54.483
ARE ALL GOOD AND
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

35:54.483 --> 35:55.484
FINE?

35:55.484 --> 35:57.656
EVERYTHING IS NOT FINE.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.428
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME,
DANNY?

35:59.428 --> 36:00.929
I JUST WISH--

36:00.929 --> 36:02.661
WHAT?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.793
I JUST WANT--

36:21.350 --> 36:22.911
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

36:22.911 --> 36:27.386
STRANGELY OKAY.
FINE.

36:27.386 --> 36:30.619
I'M SORRY AGAIN
FOR DITCHING YOU.

36:30.619 --> 36:32.621
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

36:32.621 --> 36:34.223
I BET OUR BORING,
OLD ROUTINE

36:34.223 --> 36:36.465
PROBABLY SEEMS PRETTY NICE
AFTER WHAT JUST HAPPENED, HUH?

36:36.465 --> 36:38.627
YEAH.

36:38.627 --> 36:40.869
BUT I'M NOT
GOING BACK TO IT.

36:40.869 --> 36:42.901
OH?

36:42.901 --> 36:44.633
WELL, NOT COMPLETELY.

36:44.633 --> 36:46.805
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST--

36:46.805 --> 36:49.278
THE LAST FEW YEARS,

36:49.278 --> 36:51.540
I'VE BEEN TELLING MYSELF

36:51.540 --> 36:54.383
THAT I WAS MAKING LIKE
THIS BIG, BAD-ASS CHOICE

36:54.383 --> 36:56.645
NOT TO CARE ABOUT ANYTHING,
BUT REALLY

36:56.645 --> 36:58.917
I WAS JUST SCARED OF
LETTING PEOPLE SEE ME.

36:58.917 --> 37:02.351
AND I'M SICK
OF BEING SCARED.

37:02.351 --> 37:04.693
I ACTUALLY LIKE THAT GIRL
THAT STOOD UP IN THAT VIDEO.

37:04.693 --> 37:06.895
I LIKE HER TOO.

37:06.895 --> 37:09.628
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.360
WELL, COME WITH ME.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.861
WHERE?

37:12.861 --> 37:15.434
I DON'T KNOW,
OUT OF OUR BOOTH IN THE DINER

37:15.434 --> 37:16.435
ONCE IN A WHILE.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.436
BUT I LOVE OUR BOOTH.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.538
IT'S SO COZY AND SAFE.

37:19.538 --> 37:22.271
YEAH, I LOVE OUR BOOTH TOO,
BUT IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

37:25.013 --> 37:26.575
WE ARE GOING THERE
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, RIGHT?

37:26.575 --> 37:27.876
WE'VE A REALLY IMPORTANT
CHEMISTRY QUIZ

37:27.876 --> 37:29.518
- TOMORROW.
- YEAH, COME ON.

37:41.330 --> 37:43.261
I HEARD I MISSED
QUITE THE SHOW.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.663
YEAH.

37:46.335 --> 37:47.896
YOU WERE RIGHT,
BY THE WAY...

37:49.338 --> 37:51.470
ABOUT LACEY.
SHE'LL--

37:52.801 --> 37:54.573
SHE'LL NEVER BE
MY FRIEND AGAIN.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.047
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
CATCHING ON.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.652
LOOK, I'LL STAY AWAY
FROM LACEY,

38:03.652 --> 38:07.015
BUT CAN YOU AND I

38:07.015 --> 38:09.458
AT LEAST TOLERATE
EACH OTHER?

38:09.458 --> 38:11.490
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT, I'M--

38:11.490 --> 38:14.923
I'M HERE.

38:14.923 --> 38:18.296
I DON'T NEED YOU
CALLING ME PSYCHO

38:18.296 --> 38:21.370
AND FREAK EVERY TIME
I WALK INTO A ROOM.

38:21.370 --> 38:23.472
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BLEND IN.

38:28.677 --> 38:29.808
DANNY,

38:31.610 --> 38:34.042
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BLEND IN HERE.

38:34.042 --> 38:35.544
ALL RIGHT.

38:35.544 --> 38:38.387
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FIT IN.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.890
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ACCEPT THAT.

39:06.014 --> 39:07.746
♪ I saw you standing. ♪

39:07.746 --> 39:09.117
GUESS YOU GAVE UP
ON ME, HUH?

39:09.117 --> 39:11.680
NOTHING PERSONAL.

39:15.123 --> 39:16.985
I'M NOT MAD.

39:16.985 --> 39:18.026
I PROMISE.

39:18.026 --> 39:20.659
I KNOW THIS CASE
IS IMPORTANT TO YOU,

39:20.659 --> 39:22.831
TO THE TOWN.

39:22.831 --> 39:25.033
BUT I HAVE
TO GET THIS DONE.

39:25.033 --> 39:26.765
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.037
YOU'RE IMPORTANT TO ME.

39:29.037 --> 39:31.440
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANY CASE.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.602
PROVE IT.

39:33.602 --> 39:35.103
GRAB A BOX.

39:43.912 --> 39:46.915
( door opens )

39:52.160 --> 39:54.463
I...

39:54.463 --> 39:56.965
JOINED THE SOCCER TEAM.

39:56.965 --> 39:59.968
THE COACH SAYS HE NEEDS
ANOTHER FORWARD.

39:59.968 --> 40:03.632
ESPECIALLY ONE THE OTHER TEAM
WILL BE AFRAID TO ATTACK.

40:03.632 --> 40:05.834
THAT'S WONDERFUL, DANNY.

40:08.807 --> 40:11.580
DANNY,

40:11.580 --> 40:13.141
WHY DID YOU
MOVE THAT PICTURE?

40:15.814 --> 40:18.146
MOTHER, NOT NOW, PLEASE.

40:19.147 --> 40:21.089
AND WHY IS EVERY PICTURE

40:21.089 --> 40:22.891
OF YOUR AUNT TARA MISSING
FROM THIS ALBUM?

40:26.054 --> 40:28.026
- DANNY!
- 'CAUSE IT'S MORBID!

40:30.759 --> 40:34.062
I'M TRYING TO START OVER.

40:34.062 --> 40:38.066
AND I CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING
THAT REMINDS ME OF WHAT I DID.

40:39.107 --> 40:41.540
INCLUDING TARA'S NECKLACE?

40:41.540 --> 40:44.142
WHAT NECKLACE?

40:44.142 --> 40:45.774
YOU KNOW WHAT NECKLACE.

40:45.774 --> 40:47.045
THE ONE THAT USED
TO BELONG TO TARA

40:47.045 --> 40:49.117
AND THEN SOMEHOW
ENDED UP WITH REGINA CRANE.

40:49.117 --> 40:52.821
KYLE SHOWED ME THE PICTURE.
I RECOGNIZED IT, DANNY.

40:52.821 --> 40:54.953
TARA WAS WEARING THE NECKLACE

40:54.953 --> 40:56.184
IN THE PHOTO YOU MOVED,
WASN'T SHE?

40:56.184 --> 40:59.057
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING
FROM ME?

40:59.057 --> 41:01.129
NOTHING.

41:01.129 --> 41:03.191
I JUST-- I WAS SO SCARED.

41:03.191 --> 41:05.133
WHEN CHIEF MASTERSON
SHOWED ME THAT PHOTO,

41:05.133 --> 41:07.966
I KNEW HOW BAD IT LOOKED.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.599
I JUST DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

41:10.599 --> 41:13.642
I DON'T KNOW HOW REGINA
GOT THAT NECKLACE

41:13.642 --> 41:15.243
OR WHERE IT IS NOW.

41:18.647 --> 41:20.909
MOM,

41:20.909 --> 41:22.551
PLEASE.

41:26.755 --> 41:30.719
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
BEING HERE?

41:30.719 --> 41:33.091
BACK AT THIS HOUSE?

41:33.091 --> 41:37.065
WHAT CHANCE DO I HAVE

41:37.065 --> 41:39.127
IF MY OWN MOM DOESN'T
BELIEVE ME?

41:43.972 --> 41:45.904
I DO.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.977
I DO BELIEVE YOU.

41:56.815 --> 41:58.547
WHAT DID YOU GET
FOR NUMBER TWO?

41:58.547 --> 42:00.288
UM...

42:00.288 --> 42:02.991
30 MILLIGRAMS
OF BERYLLIUM.

42:02.991 --> 42:04.222
GOOD, ME TOO.

42:04.222 --> 42:07.055
JANA KEPT CALLING IT
"BELLARIUM."

42:07.055 --> 42:08.957
SHE COULDN'T
PRONOUNCE BERYLLIUM.

42:08.957 --> 42:09.998
IT'S SO ANNOYING.

42:09.998 --> 42:12.130
- THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.
- NO, IT WAS.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.532
AND IF I HAVE TO HEAR
ONE MORE WORD ABOUT HOW

42:14.532 --> 42:16.204
SCOTT SWEPT JANA
OFF HER FEET

42:16.204 --> 42:17.736
AND THEN POURED GASOLINE
ON HER HEART

42:17.736 --> 42:19.768
AND THEN LIT IT ON FIRE,
I'LL MOVE TO NEW MEXICO.

42:19.768 --> 42:20.869
I GOT TO HAND IT
TO THE GIRL.

42:20.869 --> 42:22.771
SHE PAINTS
A VIVID PICTURE.

42:22.771 --> 42:24.072
TRUST ME I KNOW.
I COULD TELL YOU EVERYTHING

42:24.072 --> 42:25.113
THAT HAPPENED
AT REGINA'S PARTY

42:25.113 --> 42:26.845
AND I WASN'T EVEN THERE.

42:26.845 --> 42:28.647
REGINA'S PARTY? WAIT,
YOU MEAN THE ONE WHERE SHE--

42:28.647 --> 42:29.978
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

42:29.978 --> 42:31.620
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A TURN ON
THE WAY SCOTT SHOVED DANNY.

42:31.620 --> 42:32.881
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY HOOKED UP.

42:32.881 --> 42:34.583
WAIT,

42:34.583 --> 42:36.054
SCOTT SAID HE ONLY
HOOKED UP WITH JANA ONCE.

42:37.886 --> 42:40.028
AND THE ONLY REASON HE WAS
WITH HER IN THE FIRST PLACE

42:40.028 --> 42:42.190
WAS BECAUSE ARCHIE WAS
BORROWING HIS CAR ALL NIGHT.

42:42.190 --> 42:45.233
WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
ARCHIE WAS HOME

42:45.233 --> 42:46.595
THE NIGHT OF REGINA'S PARTY.

42:46.595 --> 42:47.866
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

42:47.866 --> 42:50.298
RESTING UP FOR THE BIG GAME
THE NEXT DAY.

42:50.298 --> 42:51.940
IF WAS HOME RESTING,
WHY DID HE NEED TO BORROW

42:51.940 --> 42:54.703
SCOTT'S CAR ALL NIGHT?
WHERE DID HE GO?

42:54.703 --> 42:56.975
WHY DID HE LIE ABOUT IT?

43:41.219 --> 43:42.751
HELLO, TARA.
