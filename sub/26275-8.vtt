00:02.136 --> 00:04.038
Tim Allen is back
in Last Man Standing.

00:04.072 --> 00:06.807
Am I wrong, or is it, like,
way better on this network?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.576
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.411
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.444 --> 00:13.147
The Simpsons, Rel,
and The Cool Kids.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.648
Damn straight, we are.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.716
Only on Fox.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.222
Hi, Mikey. How you doing?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.656
Busy, busy, busy.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.392
Yeah, I can hear that, buddy.
Listen...

00:24.425 --> 00:26.060
(grunts)

00:26.094 --> 00:28.162
I need to talk to you
about Kyle.

00:28.196 --> 00:32.233
I need to talk to you about
the meaning of the word "busy."

00:32.266 --> 00:34.502
I hear that you didn't like
the ad he posted

00:34.535 --> 00:36.504
for the HR position.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.672
No, I didn't.
Did-did you read it?

00:38.706 --> 00:41.041
No. Okay,
let's take a look here.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.877
All righty.
"Sporting goods chain seeks

00:43.911 --> 00:46.680
"entry-level
human resources administrator.

00:46.714 --> 00:50.751
Must be friendly but, if not,
will teach how to be friendly."

00:52.253 --> 00:53.687
"Experience preferred.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.056
"But if you have no experience,
that's okay.

00:56.090 --> 00:59.227
You've probably been doing other
really interesting things."

01:00.761 --> 01:02.696
I-I think you're being
a little hard on him.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.199
I'm just asking him to do
his job like everybody else.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.569
Well, he can't be
like everybody else. He's Kyle.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.105
The world needs one of those.

01:11.139 --> 01:14.408
You know, that's what you said
about Charlie Sheen.

01:14.442 --> 01:17.711
I love the kid, too,
but he's just not working out.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.248
Hey, Mr. B.
You wanted to see me?

01:20.281 --> 01:21.715
My cue to leave.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.718
Kyle, you're
a very special person.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.220
No matter what anyone says,

01:26.254 --> 01:29.723
everything you do is correct.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.792
What was that about?

01:31.825 --> 01:34.895
He's dying.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.930
*

01:41.769 --> 01:43.737
H-How do you feel things
are working out for you

01:43.771 --> 01:44.738
in Personnel?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.740
Uh, I don't know.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.943
I'd like it better
if we could hire everybody.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.146
Can we hire everybody?

01:52.180 --> 01:54.282
Hey, Baxter.
I need you to sign off

01:54.315 --> 01:55.983
on the new
security protocol manual.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.085
I already signed off on it.
It's on that flat piece of wood

01:58.118 --> 02:00.588
out there called your desk
that you're never sitting at.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.590
Okay, okay. Chill out.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.159
Someone woke up
on the wrong side of the coffin.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.928
Here's everybody.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.697
What's crack-a-lackin'?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.099
That's how the kids used to say

02:12.132 --> 02:15.269
"What's going on?"
back in the early 2000s.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.271
Well, I'll tell you
what's going out is you,

02:17.305 --> 02:18.306
you denim-covered marshmallow.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.107
Take Chuckles with you.
Come on.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.442
I have a deep, throaty laugh.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.676
I don't know where he gets
"Chuckles" from.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.844
"Denim-covered marshmallow."

02:23.877 --> 02:25.679
Ooh, I'm hungry.
(chuckles)

02:26.714 --> 02:28.682
(exhales)

02:28.716 --> 02:31.952
Okay. Look,
I'm just gonna say it.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.622
I-I... I think you're too nice
to work in Personnel.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.791
I think you're too nice
to work at Disneyland.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.160
You know, but we'll
find a place for you.

02:40.194 --> 02:44.131
Where? You know, I-I've been in
Sales, uh, Shipping, Personnel.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.133
I wouldn't mind going back
to Sales,

02:46.166 --> 02:49.002
but I just hired three guys.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.472
For the same job.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.873
Yeah, you're right.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.975
-Personnel is not working out.
-No.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.810
Maybe it's time
I go with Plan B.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.546
Good, good.
What's-what's your Plan B?

02:58.579 --> 03:01.715
Oh, that's the name of my
cousin's house painting company.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.351
You've probably seen their ads.

03:03.384 --> 03:07.187
Uh, "Plan B. When the best
is too expensive."

03:10.023 --> 03:12.526
Look, Outdoor Man
is your family.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.161
We'll find a place for you.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.363
All right.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.665
Kyle.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.433
Listen, I don't know
what this man said to you...

03:21.201 --> 03:23.003
...but Charlie Sheen
bounced back.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.406
So can you.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.342
-Oh, i-it's okay.
-Mm-hmm.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.245
-Uh, Mr. B says
we'll-we'll find my place.
-Mm.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.213
(chuckles)

03:33.247 --> 03:36.083
You got to stop idolizing
Charlie Sheen.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.751
Just trying to soften the blow.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.753
Listen, maybe we should give him
his old job back.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.089
You know, you know,
gussy it up a little with a,

03:42.122 --> 03:43.724
with a fancy new title.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.559
He was a floater.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.395
Executive floater,
supervising floater.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.062
The only way to dress up
a floater

03:49.096 --> 03:51.865
is with colored toilet paper.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.101
I just don't want to see
the kid hurt, that's all.

03:54.134 --> 03:57.037
Maybe we should give him
a job that he can't fail at.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.439
He just got married.
He wants to start a family.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.374
He needs a job
that can turn into a career.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.942
All right, look,
if it's about money,

04:01.975 --> 04:03.877
-he doesn't have to worry.
-Well, of course he has.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.213
-He needs money.
He's got to work.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.548
No, I-I haven't told him
this yet,

04:07.581 --> 04:10.418
but I've been thinking
of putting Kyle in my will.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.752
-What?
-Yes, yes,

04:11.785 --> 04:13.454
he's the closest thing
I have to family.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.724
You know,
you have an actual family.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.392
I want to take care of the kid.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.561
Kyle's not the type of man
that wants to be taken care of.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.630
He's the type of man that wants
to take care of people.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.231
Okay. Fine, fine, fine.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.300
So I-I shouldn't put him
in my will?

04:26.334 --> 04:29.269
No, do that. Then I won't have
to leave Mandy anything.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.309
-Hey.
-Hey. Where's Boyd?

04:35.343 --> 04:36.744
Oh, he's getting his stuff out
of the car.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.079
Listen, Boyd is gonna ask if
we can dog-sit for his friend.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.316
I told him no,
and you are going to back me up.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.951
Totally. Of course.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.419
What kind of dog?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.955
Uh, the kind we'd have to walk

04:47.988 --> 04:49.957
and feed and pick up after,

04:49.990 --> 04:51.759
which is a lot of work.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.093
United front, okay?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.462
Yeah, of course.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.498
Dad.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.933
So, my friend Jeff is going
to Utah with his family,

04:59.967 --> 05:02.436
and he asked if we would take
care of his dog, Murphy.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.171
Murphy?
That's a really great name.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.675
He can catch a Frisbee
and throw it back.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.676
What? No way.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.277
I mean...

05:10.310 --> 05:13.280
no way am I gonna allow that.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.115
If you put a piece of cheese
on his nose,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.117
he won't eat it
until you say the magic word.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.886
-What's the magic word?
-"Eat."

05:19.987 --> 05:21.288
We got to get this dog.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.956
-Ryan!
-Thanks, Dad!

05:22.990 --> 05:24.625
I'm sorry, okay, Kris,
but you didn't tell me

05:24.658 --> 05:26.293
he was the coolest dog
in the world.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.463
Please, Mom. If you point your
finger at him and say, "Bang,"

05:29.497 --> 05:31.031
he falls over.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.466
(groans)
Okay.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.001
But you have to do
all of the work.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.003
I will.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.638
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.839
I'm gonna call Jeff.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.176
Okay.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.213
I think I, uh, messed up
the whole united front thing.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.481
Yeah, a little bit.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.149
But he falls over
when you say, "Bang."

05:49.182 --> 05:50.317
I know. That's what got me, too.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.319
(chuckles)

05:52.352 --> 05:54.154
MIKE:
Hey, Mandy.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.556
What you up to?

05:55.589 --> 05:57.658
You're doing a crossword?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.494
-Yes. Don't act so surprised.
-(chuckles)

06:00.528 --> 06:02.996
Alexa, what's the capital
of Morocco?

06:03.030 --> 06:07.334
ALEXA:
Morocco's capital city
is Rabat.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.503
Rabat!

06:09.537 --> 06:12.573
So, who's doing the crossword?

06:12.606 --> 06:15.008
Uh, we're doing it together.

06:15.042 --> 06:19.680
She can do a lot of things,
but she can't write.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.516
You know, I had to pull Kyle out
of Personnel today.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.217
Why? And tell me the truth.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.020
Unless it's bad.
In that case, lie to me.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.690
Honey, it just wasn't
a good fit, you know?

06:29.723 --> 06:32.526
But I think I might have found
the perfect position for him.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.528
You know, he's good with people,

06:34.562 --> 06:36.530
and I'm thinking
of Human Resources.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.265
Fred's out of town on vacation.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.367
I'm gonna let, uh, Kyle fill in,
learn the ropes.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.103
I think he's gonna be perfect
in that position.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.038
You have to stop
doing this to him.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.040
Trying to help him
with his career?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.375
That's how you see it.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.545
Kyle sees it as him failing
at one job after another.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.380
Well, sometimes it takes
a while to...

06:53.413 --> 06:55.783
to match someone's skill set
with the right job, you know?

06:55.816 --> 07:00.387
Especially when their skill
set's as-as u-unique as Kyle's.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.389
Dad, listen,

07:02.422 --> 07:05.058
would you say
we have the perfect family?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.928
I'd say the top
of that pyramid's pretty solid.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.231
Well... (chuckles) to Kyle,
we are the perfect family.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.066
You know, compared to his.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.769
By that measure, the Mansons
look like The Brady Bunch.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.908
And sometimes, you know,
he feels like he's just...

07:20.941 --> 07:22.910
-not on our level.
-I know.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.112
He-He's been told his whole life
he'd never amount to anything,

07:25.145 --> 07:27.414
and I think that there's
a part of him deep inside

07:27.447 --> 07:28.916
that believes that.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.584
Do you believe that?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.085
No, of course not.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.421
Kyle's the best man
I've ever met.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.089
(chuckles)

07:36.123 --> 07:40.093
I think you probably mean
the second-best man.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.094
(chuckles)

07:41.128 --> 07:42.496
(chuckles):
No.

07:42.530 --> 07:46.166
(laughing)

07:46.199 --> 07:47.668
I love Kyle.
I believe in Kyle.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.102
What I'm trying to get

07:49.136 --> 07:51.839
is to get Kyle
to believe in Kyle.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.841
You sure about this?

07:53.874 --> 07:56.009
'Cause I don't think
he can handle another failure.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.345
He's not gonna fail at this.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.781
-Okay. Thanks, Dad.
-You bet.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.449
You're the best.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.118
Oh, I think
you mean second-best.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.988
Yeah.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.697
Hey, Kyle. How's it going?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.031
Oh. Hey, Mr. B.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.299
Ooh.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.969
Does Mandy know
that you have another family?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.171
Oh, that's-that's Fred's family.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.338
I've been answering a lot

08:25.372 --> 08:26.840
-of questions today.
-Good, good, good.

08:26.874 --> 08:30.310
Most of them were,
"Where's Fred?"

08:30.343 --> 08:32.012
You got this. You got this.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.382
Hey, Mike.

08:35.415 --> 08:36.483
Well, look who showed up,

08:36.516 --> 08:38.485
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumbass.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.653
(Joe and Chuck chuckle)

08:39.687 --> 08:40.988
Good one, Baxter.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.189
King of zings!

08:42.222 --> 08:43.490
(chuckling)

08:43.523 --> 08:46.159
Where's Fred?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.995
Oh, uh, he's on vacation.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.063
Well, look,
just tell him we stopped by.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.332
-Yeah.
-Or don't.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.001
-Uh, never mind.
-Uh, hey, wait.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.502
Uh, is there a problem?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.405
Because, if there is,
I'm supposed to help solve it.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.407
(sighs) Well,
we'd like to file a complaint

09:00.440 --> 09:01.675
-against someone.
-Yeah.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.410
Oh. That's too bad.

09:03.443 --> 09:04.845
Uh, give me a second.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.347
We have a form for that.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.384
Okay, and who are we filing
the complaint against?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.454
-Mike Baxter.
-Mike Baxter.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.525
Where's Fred?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.228
(Kristin and Boyd chuckling)

09:21.261 --> 09:23.430
-Oh, I can't get over
how cute he is.
-Oh.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.765
-KRISTIN: Come here. Hey.
-Is he here? Oh!

09:24.798 --> 09:26.399
-(giggling)
-Okay.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.568
I got everything on the list,
including his dog food.

09:28.602 --> 09:32.405
Happy to see that, like me,
he's gluten-free.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.907
But he's wearing fur.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.909
You should talk to him
about that.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.378
A pig's ear.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.380
-Gross and cool.
-KRISTIN: Okay.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.215
Come on, Boyd.
Let's go put that stuff away.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.217
BOYD:
Okay.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.887
So, Murphy,
what should we do first?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.388
(growling)

09:48.421 --> 09:49.422
Oh!

09:50.157 --> 09:51.591
Stay?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.226
Kris? Honey?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.763
Uh, can you come in here
for a second, please?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.597
Did he shake your hand?

09:57.631 --> 10:00.400
I know. It's adorable.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.403
No, he was, um...

10:03.436 --> 10:05.572
Was he totally fine
with you in here?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.942
Of course. Who's the best dog
in the whole world, huh?

10:08.976 --> 10:11.411
-You are. You are.
-Okay.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.446
Are you okay with him?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.949
Yeah. Of course. Fine.
I'm great with animals.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.751
President of the 4-H Club.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.320
Trimmed a badger's nails once.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.956
Okay. I'm gonna go start dinner.

10:22.990 --> 10:23.957
Great.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.426
-(growling)
-Oh.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.328
Why don't you do that when
other people are in the room?

10:28.361 --> 10:29.963
Do you know
how personal that seems?

10:29.997 --> 10:31.431
(growling)

10:31.464 --> 10:33.133
Bang?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.467
Yeah, no, didn't think so.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.446
I forgot.
Uh, who was it again

10:46.479 --> 10:47.681
you wanted to file
a complaint against?

10:47.715 --> 10:49.616
Uh-huh. For the fifth time,

10:49.649 --> 10:51.618
Mike Baxter.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.020
But what's to complain about?

10:53.053 --> 10:54.287
His hair's too full?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.656
His eyes are too blue?

10:56.690 --> 10:58.125
No, he's too mean, okay?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.993
And you're
a little too much in love.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.329
I'm a Marine.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.530
I can deal with a few insults.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.798
What I can't deal with

11:04.832 --> 11:06.800
is someone demeaning me
in front of my staff.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.802
You know, it's the same thing
at the garage.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.804
He goes out of his way
to call me slow and lazy,

11:10.838 --> 11:13.841
but he... never calls
to see how I'm doing.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.644
He doesn't mean anything by it.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.379
Uh, Mr. B talks
to everyone that way.

11:19.412 --> 11:23.817
I saw him call a Girl Scout
a "cookie-peddling socialist."

11:23.851 --> 11:25.819
Joe, this is a waste of time.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.021
He's the boss's son-in-law.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.489
You're right.
Look, we don't want any trouble.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.324
-Let's get out of here.
-Oh, yeah. Hang on.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.994
Okay, according to HR policy,

11:34.027 --> 11:35.863
once I've been informed
of a complaint,

11:35.896 --> 11:37.865
I have to...

11:37.898 --> 11:40.333
"initiate a grievance hearing."

11:40.367 --> 11:43.070
Oh, that sounds serious.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.739
Grievance hearing... with Mike,
the king of zings? (chuckles)

11:45.773 --> 11:48.175
Oh, hell no.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.177
And since Fred's out of town,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.245
I have to run the mediation.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.347
Oh, hell, hell no.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.884
Look, let's just, let's just
wait till Fred gets back.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.020
It doesn't sound like you're
the right man for our case.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.022
Uh, maybe, you know,
'cause what you're describing

12:02.055 --> 12:04.724
just doesn't sound like
the Mike Baxter that I know.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.861
Hey... guys, leave Kyle alone.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.863
He's trying
to make a name for himself.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.065
You already have your names.
What-what are they?

12:12.099 --> 12:14.067
Tweedle Dee.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.736
Tweedle Dumbass.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.074
I love being the boss.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.879
Gentlemen...

12:25.913 --> 12:27.915
I'll take the case.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.057
Yeah. Come in, Kyle.
What's up? Come in.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.458
Um, you know, I was hoping

12:38.491 --> 12:40.427
-I could get your advice.
-Yeah.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.430
As you know, I'm-I'm manning
the HR desk while Fred is away.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.566
And you found something
in his drawer?

12:46.599 --> 12:50.137
Pills, booze,
or a girlie magazine?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.640
Oh, I saw this coming.

12:53.673 --> 12:57.610
What? No. No, the only thing
in Fred's drawer is a Bible.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.247
He's a good man, that Fred.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.115
Yeah. I-I agree, and that's why

13:02.149 --> 13:04.985
I'm thinking it might be better
to wait for him to get back

13:05.018 --> 13:06.820
before HR deals
with a complaint.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.589
There's been a complaint?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.092
Was it from that tall guy
in shipping?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.095
I swear to God,
I thought his name was "Stilts."

13:15.128 --> 13:17.664
No, no. The-the complaint
is not about you, sir.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.299
Oh.

13:19.332 --> 13:23.103
But it does concern somebody
at the highest level.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.337
Mike.

13:24.371 --> 13:27.474
Oh, I-I really can't say.

13:27.507 --> 13:31.011
But if I could say,
I would say "yes."

13:31.044 --> 13:33.280
You really can't sit
on a complaint, Kyle.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.016
That's how they fester.
You can't wait for Fred.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.285
You've got to take care of this
right away.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.954
But Mr. B,
he's my father-in-law.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.357
I mean, in a way, we're related.

13:44.391 --> 13:47.360
That doesn't matter. Sit-sit
down, sit down, sit down. Sit.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.329
Yeah, you have a bright future.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.165
I see great things for you.
Great things.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.702
I bet one day you'll be living
in a house just like mine.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.306
Just exactly like mine.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.641
Oh, I don't think so.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.977
I don't give a damn
what you think.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.845
And I'll bet you'll have
a vineyard like mine.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.181
Exactly like mine.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.219
And a coin collection, hmm?

14:12.252 --> 14:13.653
I-I can't think about my future.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.188
I mean, all I can think about

14:15.222 --> 14:17.157
is not wanting
to have to run this hearing.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.558
I understand,
but whoever filed this complaint

14:18.591 --> 14:19.993
came to you for help.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.030
This is your chance
to take care of others.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.899
Ooh. Okay.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.667
-Hmm?
-I'll do it.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.336
Yeah. Okay.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.338
Listen to your heart, Kyle.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.074
One day you'll be sitting
in that mountain cabin

14:34.107 --> 14:37.710
remembering this as the day
you took control of your future.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.013
-Hmm?
-Well, if that's true,

14:40.047 --> 14:42.382
I just hope it's as nice
as your cabin.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.219
(chuckles)

14:46.253 --> 14:48.188
It will be, son.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.557
You'll see. Exactly.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.027
KYLE:
Okay.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.363
Uh, I call to order
this grievance hearing.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.898
Uh, the complainants are
Chuck Larabee and Joe Leonard,

14:58.932 --> 15:01.434
henceforth known as
"aggrieved parties," against...

15:01.468 --> 15:03.470
Witch hunt!

15:05.472 --> 15:08.908
-Uh, Mr. Baxter.
-Fake news.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.381
Okay, uh, Mr. Baxter, uh, you're
what we call "out of order."

15:14.414 --> 15:16.083
You're damn right
he's out of order.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.952
The only thing that works
on that guy is his mouth.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.221
Okay. Okay, uh, Mr. Leonard,
now you are out of order.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.390
Okay, our policy states
that when a participant

15:23.423 --> 15:25.425
violates protocol, I'm required

15:25.458 --> 15:27.794
to put a black mark
in their personnel file.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.929
Why's it got to be black?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.935
It's the only one I have.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.072
Uh, "X."

15:39.106 --> 15:41.074
"X" marks the dummy.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.943
Hey. Oh, you've just given me
a perfect example

15:43.977 --> 15:45.745
of what we call "crosstalk."

15:45.778 --> 15:47.314
Now, to avoid crosstalk,
you'll only speak

15:47.347 --> 15:48.748
when I've given you the signal.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.850
So, uh, Mr. Larabee.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.087
Oh, this finger
is the signal, so...

15:54.121 --> 15:55.322
(Chuck clears throat)

15:55.355 --> 15:56.789
I'm giving you a signal
with my finger

15:56.823 --> 15:58.291
under the table right now.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.827
See that?

16:00.860 --> 16:03.296
See that? Mike Baxter
is a sarcastic bastard

16:03.330 --> 16:05.465
who thinks he can say
whatever he wants.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.268
He ought to have that smug smirk
wiped off his face

16:08.301 --> 16:10.203
with a closed fist.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.140
Oh, dear. Okay. What to do

16:13.173 --> 16:15.942
when the aggrieved uses
inflammatory language.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.012
This thing needs an index.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.613
Wait a minute.
Is that what this is about?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.282
I hurt somebody's feelings?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.517
Hey, I can't even enjoy
a bear claw at work

16:24.551 --> 16:27.187
without being called--
and I quote--

16:27.220 --> 16:29.456
"Joe-bese."

16:29.489 --> 16:32.125
That's body shaming,
that's what that is.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.127
You're a size-ist. Put that
in his record. Write that...

16:34.161 --> 16:36.463
Hey, hey. Hey, okay,
all right. First of all,

16:36.496 --> 16:38.031
I decide
when to mark the X's.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.500
And second of all,
I didn't point at any of you.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.969
So... X, X, X.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.204
Ooh.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.672
That's two X's for you.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.841
Even your file's
becoming Joe-bese.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.377
Okay, gentlemen,
the purpose of this hearing is

16:50.410 --> 16:52.645
to give everyone a chance
to be heard, all right?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.147
And if you keep speaking
out of order,

16:54.181 --> 16:55.515
-then-then no one gets heard.
-MIKE: Listen,

16:55.548 --> 16:57.150
-you're-you're an ex-Marine,
right?
-Mm-hmm.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.986
You know, I'm sure I'm not the
only one to call you a bonehead.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.654
-That was, like, your rank,
wasn't it? Bonehead?
-Mr. B...

17:01.688 --> 17:04.057
My drill sergeant could
kill a man with his thumb.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.825
-What you got?
-Guys...

17:05.858 --> 17:07.560
-Hmm?
-I was told there'd be dinner!

17:07.594 --> 17:10.497
-'Cause you haven't eaten
in what, five minutes?
-Mr. Baxter!

17:10.530 --> 17:13.166
-No. I just want a crudité
platter. That's all.
-KYLE: Please.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.502
-Look, I'm dealing with
a snowflake and a snowball.
-Man...

17:15.535 --> 17:19.038
Okay, everybody shut up!

17:19.072 --> 17:20.707
Okay, we are gonna
have this hearing

17:20.740 --> 17:22.709
in accordance
with the proper procedure.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.077
-Nah...
-This is all...

17:24.111 --> 17:25.512
Okay, now you will
respect the pointer.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.913
-I don't think...
-Do you hear me?

17:26.946 --> 17:29.382
Respect the pointer!

17:29.416 --> 17:30.917
I don't know about you fellas,

17:30.950 --> 17:34.020
but I'm gonna
respect the pointer.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.022
Keep reading.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.525
You know what?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.527
Forget the binder.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.029
Okay? I want you all
to look at each other

17:43.062 --> 17:46.032
and think about the mean
and dismissive words

17:46.065 --> 17:48.034
that you've used
at this meeting.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.537
Okay? Like "bastard"
and "bonehead"

17:50.570 --> 17:52.572
and "crudité."

17:57.910 --> 18:00.046
Look, that's not how coworkers
talk to each other.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.948
And it's definitely not
how friends should.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.717
At Outdoor Man, we're not just
coworkers, all right?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.754
We're not just friends.
We're a family.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.957
And it's time you guys
started acting like one.

18:17.630 --> 18:21.134
See? See?
I told you guys he could do it.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.236
No, I told you he could do it.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.238
Well, we both told each other.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.907
Well, can someone tell me
what I did?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.577
Baxter put us all up to this.
There's no complaint.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.579
The man does have a mouth
on him,

18:32.612 --> 18:34.747
but I wouldn't go running to HR.
I'd just...

18:34.781 --> 18:37.750
-cut his brake lines.
-Yeah, yeah.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.320
Well, what, so this was a setup?

18:40.353 --> 18:42.789
Yeah, I wrote all those
fat jokes. Those are mine.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.257
It was good, too.
It wasn't a setup.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.825
It was more of a test,
you know, and,

18:45.858 --> 18:47.327
Joe, Chuck,
I appreciate what you did.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.430
Look, I do know your names,
but now, get back to work.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.766
And that "size-ist" thing--
totally improvised that myself.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.269
(laughs)
I had a whole monologue planned.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.305
I was gonna cry.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.774
-Ah.
-So...

19:01.808 --> 19:03.476
-if this was a test...
-Mm-hmm.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.944
...did I pass?

19:04.977 --> 19:08.315
Well, um,
how do you think you did?

19:08.348 --> 19:11.484
Well, I don't mean to boast,
but I think I got a solid "C."

19:11.518 --> 19:13.152
-Yeah.
-Ah.

19:13.186 --> 19:16.523
I think I'll give you an A-plus.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.957
I'm a little tougher than Ed.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.959
Um, I'll give you
an A-plus, too.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.463
Listen, you know how people
should be treated, right?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.832
And that gooey-- dare I say--

19:25.865 --> 19:28.968
liberal heart of yours
is why I put you in HR.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.470
It's where you belong.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.372
Thank you.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.342
All right, I'm gonna go call
my cousin at Plan B.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.143
He's gonna have
to do some cheap,

19:37.176 --> 19:39.346
second-rate
house painting without me.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.880
Perfect.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.516
Oh, that kid. Ah. Oh, man.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.319
-We did a good job of that.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.020
Hey, by the way, uh...
I don't know.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.389
-You know, it's, uh...
-Yeah.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.658
...hard to say,
but am I in your will?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.059
(Ed laughs)

19:53.092 --> 19:55.662
Look at you, look at you,

19:55.695 --> 19:58.365
thinking that
I'm going to die first.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.345
Uh, Vanessa, I have
a science question for you.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.013
Well, I'm kind of rusty,

20:14.046 --> 20:16.583
which is what happens
when iron is exposed to oxygen.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.184
(laughs)

20:18.217 --> 20:20.687
I'm not rusty. It's just so fun.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.191
Um, whenever I'm alone
with Murphy, he growls at me.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.759
What? That doesn't make sense.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.895
He's such a fuzzy-fuzzy-fuzzy...

20:28.928 --> 20:30.697
Yeah, no, I got it.
He's fuzzy-fuzzy-fuzzy.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.700
Um, he's only not growling right
now because you're in the room.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.869
Oh. Well, there is a scientific
way to figure this out.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.105
Uh, I will just step out
of the room.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.208
-Here.
-Okay.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.378
-(growling)
-Uh, yup, he's doing it.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.380
(growling)

20:47.414 --> 20:50.283
Okay, uh, well, what are the,
uh, what are the variables?

20:50.317 --> 20:51.951
You're the only man
in the house.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.454
Yeah. Could be...
could be my voice.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.888
VANESSA:
All right, well, hey,

20:55.922 --> 20:58.891
try-try speaking
to him in a higher pitch.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.560
Uh...

21:00.593 --> 21:04.230
(high-pitched):
Hi, Murphy. I'm a lady.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.299
(growling)

21:06.333 --> 21:07.800
What the hell is happening?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.602
Science experiment.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.304
Okay, what else? Oh...

21:11.338 --> 21:13.239
Oh, dogs are pack animals.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.608
Maybe you need to establish
yourself as the alpha.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.077
-Growl back at him.
-Really?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.447
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the same
thing I told you about Mike.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.416
-(growling)
-Okay, uh...

21:23.450 --> 21:24.751
(Ryan growls)

21:24.784 --> 21:28.455
(both growling)

21:28.488 --> 21:32.091
-(barking)
-Oh, okay. No.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.094
Oh, my God, Ryan. It's your hat.
He hates your hat.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.463
Yeah, it's my hat.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.097
-Yeah.
-Of course it's my hat.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.334
He doesn't hate me.
I'm adorable. Yeah.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.470
Somebody with a hat
must have scared him

21:43.503 --> 21:44.937
when he was a puppy.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.273
Ah, congratulations.
Of course, it means

21:47.306 --> 21:49.776
-you have to get rid
of that hat.
-So what?

21:49.809 --> 21:52.011
I'll just give it to Mike
and introduce him to Murphy.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.282

21:56.315 --> 21:58.184

Media Access Group at WGBH

22:00.520 --> 22:02.555
Still need more laughs
after Last Man Standing?

22:02.589 --> 22:04.791
Then here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:07.226 --> 22:08.428
Buckle up, buttercup.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.132
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.703

shooting star *

22:16.736 --> 22:20.306
* We live for glory

MAN: Touchdown!
