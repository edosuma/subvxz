01:39.184 --> 01:40.935
No, Dolores!

01:41.186 --> 01:43.271
Leave me be!

01:43.438 --> 01:45.481
Let go of me!

01:46.900 --> 01:48.943
Let go of me, Dolores!

01:49.777 --> 01:51.613
Let me go!

02:52.257 --> 02:54.509
Please, Dolores.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.471
Got a certified letter here.

02:59.097 --> 03:01.683
Never believe what happened
down at the dock.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.853
Dolores Claiborne, what the hell are you...

03:05.687 --> 03:07.021
Oh, my God.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.067
What have you done?

03:14.696 --> 03:17.824
Put it down. Do you hear me?
Just put it down.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.703
Jesus, Dolores.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.210
Oh, God.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.796
Oh, my God.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.507
You killed her.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.534
- So you lose the picture.
- Not happening.

04:01.826 --> 04:02.827
Is half a page.

04:02.911 --> 04:04.746
I'll let you write the caption.

04:04.829 --> 04:07.665
- Come on, Peter. Is crucial.
- Is salad.

04:08.208 --> 04:09.792
I'm setting up the whole campaign.

04:09.876 --> 04:12.086
Is a better piece without it.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.380
You already said it was brilliant.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.300
I said it was wonderful.

04:17.509 --> 04:19.344
- There's a difference?
- Yeah.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.137
Half a page.

04:24.599 --> 04:25.683
Fine.

04:26.351 --> 04:29.521
I only left it in so you'd cut it out anyway.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.023
I'm ready for Arizona.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.651
You should see what I have
for the malpractice piece.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.653
- The surgeon's ex-wife...
- Wait a minute.

04:37.195 --> 04:39.656
Had her on the phone
for 20 minutes last night.

04:39.739 --> 04:41.950
- I haven't assigned you that story.
- You will.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.117
Slow down.

04:44.077 --> 04:46.287
Come on, Peter. There's a book here.

04:46.371 --> 04:47.747
I deserve this.

04:47.956 --> 04:50.834
Why does every story have to be do or die
with you?

04:51.376 --> 04:53.878
You're not the only writer here, okay?

04:54.045 --> 04:57.549
I've got a dozen people out there
to keep happy. You know that.

04:57.966 --> 04:58.967
Great.

04:59.050 --> 05:02.804
So now you're not only not fucking me
anymore, you're fucking me.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.059
What is it, Helen?

05:08.226 --> 05:09.894
There's a fax here for Selena.

05:10.103 --> 05:11.104
From Phoenix?

05:11.187 --> 05:14.274
No, is a clipping
from the Bangor Daily News.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.652
"Socialite Dead,
Housekeeper Held for Questioning.

05:17.735 --> 05:21.072
- "Mrs. Dolores St. George of..."
- Where's the cover sheet?

08:19.542 --> 08:20.752
Fax?

08:21.085 --> 08:21.961
Forget it.

08:22.253 --> 08:25.006
They're hardly out of the 19th century
up here.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.258
Are you kidding?

08:27.717 --> 08:30.678
No, there's no motel. One restaurant.

08:30.929 --> 08:33.681
They've got me sleeping
on a cot in the town hall.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.934
Tell him to relax. This is no vacation.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.938
I'll be back on the mainland
as soon as I wrap this up.

08:50.532 --> 08:54.285
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'm looking for Dolores Claiborne.

08:54.619 --> 08:55.954
And you are?

08:56.287 --> 08:57.705
I'm her daughter.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.625
I'm John Mackey.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.461
- Detective, Maine State Police.
- Hello.

09:04.879 --> 09:07.340
Would you please call
Constable Stamshaw?

09:07.423 --> 09:09.467
- Get him to come right out.
- Yes, sir.

09:09.968 --> 09:11.386
I'm sorry.

09:11.553 --> 09:13.888
No smoking. Public building.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.560
We've met before, Miss St. George.

09:18.643 --> 09:19.644
Have we?

09:20.311 --> 09:21.896
You were about 13.

09:22.856 --> 09:24.858
What year was that, the eclipse?

09:26.234 --> 09:28.069
Must have been, what, '75?

09:28.862 --> 09:30.405
I was the investigator...

09:30.655 --> 09:32.198
...when your father died.

09:32.657 --> 09:34.284
We met at the hearing.

09:35.159 --> 09:36.494
Whas up, John?

09:36.911 --> 09:38.580
Miss St. George is here.

09:39.581 --> 09:40.665
Selena?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.085
Oh, my gravy.

09:44.335 --> 09:45.837
Frank Stamshaw.

09:46.171 --> 09:47.422
Marshall's brother.

09:48.173 --> 09:49.299
- Right.
- Jonesport High.

09:49.424 --> 09:52.468
- Of course. How are you?
- Is been quite a while, I guess.

09:52.552 --> 09:53.928
Certainly has.

09:56.097 --> 09:58.349
To be honest,
I'm surprised to see you here.

09:58.433 --> 10:01.895
Your mom's been pretty firm
about us not trying to contact you.

10:02.187 --> 10:05.356
- I didn't know Dolores made any calls.
- She didn't call.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.942
I saw the Bangor paper.
It was faxed to my office.

10:08.109 --> 10:09.360
And where's that?

10:09.527 --> 10:11.279
I came up from New York.

10:12.030 --> 10:13.907
Look, is she here or not?

10:14.032 --> 10:16.367
- Yeah. She's right upstairs.
- Thank you.

10:17.035 --> 10:18.036
But...

10:18.119 --> 10:19.204
John?

10:21.372 --> 10:22.957
Is she under arrest?

10:23.208 --> 10:24.709
Technically, no.

10:25.418 --> 10:28.463
Detective Mackey came last night,
and we're just starting.

10:28.546 --> 10:29.589
On what?

10:29.672 --> 10:32.133
We've scheduled an inquest
for Monday morning.

10:32.217 --> 10:34.260
We'll sort things out over the weekend.

10:34.344 --> 10:36.638
If she's not under arrest
why is she in custody?

10:36.721 --> 10:39.098
Right, okay. Vera Donovan is dead.

10:39.724 --> 10:42.393
There's an autopsy in Machais
this morning.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.895
And, you know...

10:44.896 --> 10:46.314
...she died from a fall.

10:46.481 --> 10:50.568
Your mother was the only person
with Mrs. Donovan at the time.

10:51.528 --> 10:53.363
That was her job, wasn't it?

10:53.905 --> 10:56.407
I'm afraid, Miss St. George...

10:57.158 --> 11:00.954
...there's a little more to this
than what you may have read in the paper.

11:09.587 --> 11:10.964
What are you doing?

11:12.465 --> 11:15.093
Straightening up this friggin' mess,
is what I'm doing.

11:15.176 --> 11:17.512
Gorry, but this place is a dump.

11:17.804 --> 11:20.348
Jesus. You're a suspect, you're not a maid.

11:20.515 --> 11:22.267
Just leave that be.

11:22.433 --> 11:24.435
There's someone to see you here.

11:24.936 --> 11:27.105
I told you, I don't want no lawyer.

11:33.695 --> 11:35.196
Is your daughter.

11:42.287 --> 11:43.997
My God.

11:44.289 --> 11:45.540
Look at you.

11:52.130 --> 11:53.464
You cut your hair.

11:56.050 --> 11:57.886
I didn't...

12:02.056 --> 12:03.057
You call her?

12:03.474 --> 12:04.893
Is that what you did?

12:05.810 --> 12:09.063
- Jeezly crow, you got some nerve.
- She's here on her own.

12:15.612 --> 12:16.905
Look at you.

12:22.535 --> 12:23.661
I'm just...

12:26.956 --> 12:28.500
My God.

12:32.504 --> 12:34.255
Is it really you?

12:48.353 --> 12:49.354
Look.

12:51.773 --> 12:54.442
- Hey, Ms. Claiborne!
- Kill anyone else today?

12:54.526 --> 12:57.695
Not yet. When I change my mind,
I know exactly where I'll start.

12:57.779 --> 12:59.531
- Go home.
- Where's the car?

12:59.781 --> 13:01.574
Right there across the street.

13:02.534 --> 13:04.536
You've been living at the Donovan's.

13:04.702 --> 13:05.870
Is a crime scene now.

13:05.954 --> 13:07.872
I got my own house, and you know it.

13:07.956 --> 13:10.792
We'd like her to stay here for at least
the next four days.

13:10.875 --> 13:14.546
If I decide to make my grand escape
to South America, I'll let you know.

13:14.629 --> 13:17.924
- I'd appreciate it.
- One last thing, Mrs. St. George.

13:18.132 --> 13:19.551
Name is Claiborne!

13:19.634 --> 13:21.845
I changed it when Joe died,
and you know it.

13:21.928 --> 13:24.222
I'm very sorry, Ms. Claiborne.

13:24.514 --> 13:26.224
"Morning, Pam.

13:28.017 --> 13:32.522
I'm sorry, but I think is for the best
if you got some legal representation.

13:32.605 --> 13:33.898
You're sorry, are you?

13:34.107 --> 13:37.485
Last time you were sorry was
when you had to use the pay toilet...

13:37.569 --> 13:39.821
...and the string on your pet dime broke.

14:00.717 --> 14:03.678
I'm just muzzy here,
trying to think of what to say.

14:06.431 --> 14:08.016
All grown up...

14:08.516 --> 14:09.684
...looking so...

14:09.934 --> 14:12.520
You turned out a beautiful woman, Selena.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.939
I just can't believe you're here.

14:16.024 --> 14:17.942
That makes two of us.

14:21.279 --> 14:23.781
There must be a reason
why you go out of your way...

14:23.865 --> 14:25.950
...to antagonize them like that.

14:26.784 --> 14:29.954
Sometimes being a bitch
is all a woman has to hold onto.

14:35.293 --> 14:36.544
Nice car.

14:36.794 --> 14:37.921
Is a rental.

14:39.839 --> 14:42.050
You pay by the day or by the week?

14:42.759 --> 14:45.970
I assume thas your way of asking
how long I'm staying.

14:46.304 --> 14:48.973
Good gorry, you're more nervous than me.

14:49.307 --> 14:51.726
I have to be in Phoenix on Monday.

14:52.435 --> 14:57.148
Is a big story. I'm trying to get out of it,
but it may not be possible, all right?

15:02.820 --> 15:04.155
I didn't kill her.

15:06.199 --> 15:08.826
I didn't push her down
that friggin' staircase.

15:09.327 --> 15:11.079
Thas what you want to know?

15:11.162 --> 15:12.664
Well, I'm telling you.

15:12.747 --> 15:17.001
I did not murder that bitch any more
than I'm wearing a diamond tiara.

15:17.460 --> 15:18.920
He's got an eyewitness...

15:19.254 --> 15:22.924
...who puts you standing over a dead body
with a rolling pin.

15:23.091 --> 15:24.342
When did you start smoking?

15:24.425 --> 15:27.637
Are you not listening to me?
They're talking murder here.

15:30.223 --> 15:32.517
You're lucky I didn't have to post bail.

16:00.253 --> 16:01.671
Spooky, ain't it?

16:02.714 --> 16:04.966
Can't stand out here all day.

16:07.260 --> 16:08.636
What a mess.

16:09.804 --> 16:11.472
A regular bunch of artistes.

16:14.434 --> 16:16.144
Look at this mess.

16:19.731 --> 16:21.816
Cheese and crackers.

16:27.405 --> 16:29.282
Friggin' little bastards.

16:29.490 --> 16:31.576
I've got an idea who they are, too.

16:37.916 --> 16:39.417
Let me try.

17:15.203 --> 17:16.496
Selena.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.959
Get in the house.

17:22.167 --> 17:25.128
Selena, I said get in the house, right now.

17:26.172 --> 17:28.132
I am in the house.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.751
Is cold, I know.

18:06.671 --> 18:08.548
God, is a dust bowl.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.635
Thank God I kept the electric up.

18:14.846 --> 18:18.266
I got some wood.
We'll have hot water pretty quick.

18:20.894 --> 18:23.521
Clean linens upstairs, last I looked.

18:25.356 --> 18:28.526
Longer you stand there,
the more boogery is gonna feel.

18:30.695 --> 18:31.779
Is dead.

18:33.281 --> 18:35.408
Is off three years, at least.

18:36.910 --> 18:39.704
I'd know that if I called more often, right?

18:41.789 --> 18:44.375
You called Vera's last Christmas.

18:45.293 --> 18:47.420
The lines go both ways, Mother.

18:53.051 --> 18:56.387
Look, this isn't gonna work.
I need a phone.

18:56.638 --> 18:58.556
I'm gonna stay at the motel.

18:59.390 --> 19:00.350
Is closed.

19:00.558 --> 19:02.101
Is off-season.

19:03.686 --> 19:05.563
What about Riner's Inn?

19:05.772 --> 19:07.315
He's gone.

19:07.732 --> 19:09.108
Burned down.

19:09.442 --> 19:12.070
Must be five years ago by now.

19:14.072 --> 19:14.864
Shit.

19:17.325 --> 19:19.077
There's phones in town.

19:19.244 --> 19:21.830
- We've gotta go shoppin' anyway.
- I'll go.

19:22.247 --> 19:23.206
Alone.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.459
I'll take care of it.

19:27.085 --> 19:28.920
You don't know what we need.

19:29.629 --> 19:31.840
I'm assuming is everything.

21:21.074 --> 21:24.869
You know what? I've got a game.
Do you know how to count by fives?

21:24.953 --> 21:28.915
You don't. I can teach you.
I know you are. You're smart.

21:29.749 --> 21:33.127
Kes count by fives. You want to play
hide and seek? Ready?

21:33.837 --> 21:36.381
5, 10,15, 20...

21:36.464 --> 21:38.550
...25, 30.

21:44.639 --> 21:48.393
Where is she? Where did she go?
I can't find Selena anywhere.

21:48.852 --> 21:53.731
I hear an awful lot of thunder upstairs,
but I can't find Selena anywhere.

21:53.815 --> 21:54.816
Where is she?

21:54.899 --> 21:56.484
Is she lost?

21:56.609 --> 21:58.570
What was that I heard?

21:59.112 --> 22:00.613
What did I hear?

22:00.905 --> 22:03.283
I don't know. I think I heard something.

22:24.512 --> 22:26.014
There you are.

22:27.098 --> 22:29.100
Let me help you. Thas my job.

22:29.267 --> 22:31.811
- You must be starving.
- All these calls.

22:32.020 --> 22:34.022
Ended up longer than I thought.

22:34.147 --> 22:35.440
Water's warm.

22:35.607 --> 22:38.151
You'll want a nice, hot bath. I got this.

22:38.234 --> 22:40.653
I spent an hour finding this radiologist...

22:40.737 --> 22:43.656
...just so that he could tell me
he won't go on record.

22:43.948 --> 22:45.617
Is that your new story?

22:49.621 --> 22:51.623
You say there's hot water?

22:53.833 --> 22:56.461
Why don't you go on up
and get yourself fresh?

22:58.671 --> 22:59.672
Go on.

22:59.839 --> 23:01.174
It won't bite you.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.675
Must be a lot of pressure.

23:45.677 --> 23:47.136
All them famous people...

23:47.220 --> 23:48.680
...talking to them.

23:49.514 --> 23:51.391
I framed the picture.

23:52.016 --> 23:53.726
You and Richard Nixon.

23:53.893 --> 23:55.687
He was selling a book.

23:56.020 --> 23:57.522
I got a scrapbook.

23:57.605 --> 23:59.399
Saved all your articles.

23:59.607 --> 24:02.318
Drugstore in Jonesport puts them aside
for me.

24:03.403 --> 24:05.196
I used to read them to Vera...

24:06.823 --> 24:09.033
...when she was clear enough to listen.

24:10.368 --> 24:12.412
You've done so well for yourself.

24:13.371 --> 24:15.206
Is that what you think?

24:15.623 --> 24:17.083
How well I've done?

24:18.376 --> 24:23.256
Hell, even Miss Vera Kiss-My-Back-Cheeks
Donovan couldn't help but be impressed.

24:23.464 --> 24:27.051
Her look when she saw
that picture-on-the-cover story...

24:27.135 --> 24:29.554
You woulďve thought she passed a brick.

24:31.931 --> 24:33.808
Maybe you ought to slow down.

24:33.892 --> 24:36.144
Believe me, I know my limit.

24:39.439 --> 24:41.274
Don't that sound familiar?

24:46.404 --> 24:48.573
I'd leave it alone if I were you.

24:49.657 --> 24:51.868
I've seen my share of drunks, is all.

24:52.785 --> 24:54.245
Thas all I'm sayin'.

24:55.663 --> 24:57.874
What did he have to be happy about?

25:01.461 --> 25:04.380
I suppose making sure everyone was
as miserable as he was.

25:07.967 --> 25:09.761
Is that why you killed him?

25:26.277 --> 25:28.530
Oh, tough question, I guess.

25:30.490 --> 25:31.991
Occupational hazard.

25:34.327 --> 25:36.454
Don't feel too bad, Ma.

25:36.621 --> 25:39.624
I asked Jean Harris the same thing once.

25:45.630 --> 25:47.006
Les face it, Mother.

25:47.090 --> 25:48.424
We barely know each other.

25:48.508 --> 25:52.470
We haven't spoken in years, and thas
as much your doing as it is mine.

25:53.847 --> 25:55.974
You didn't kill Vera, great.

25:56.182 --> 25:58.059
You've got nothing to worry about.

25:58.184 --> 26:00.979
If you did, then you deserve
whatever comes.

26:01.271 --> 26:02.355
Just...

26:02.647 --> 26:07.318
...les not pretend we're in some goddamn
Norman Rockwell family reunion here.

26:07.694 --> 26:10.530
I'm sorry, Ma, but thas where we are.

26:11.406 --> 26:13.324
And as for Dad...

26:13.992 --> 26:16.661
...the few memories I have of him...

26:17.745 --> 26:18.830
...l'd like to keep.

26:21.124 --> 26:23.209
Are you listening to me?

26:37.765 --> 26:38.766
Daddy.

26:39.851 --> 26:41.519
We made tapioca!

26:41.728 --> 26:42.896
Get out.

26:43.229 --> 26:46.191
We did. And is not instant either.

26:46.399 --> 26:48.359
And with real cream.

26:48.735 --> 26:52.822
And the next thing you'll tell me
is you made it just for me, right?

26:54.365 --> 26:57.202
Oh, McCrea, there's that St. George smile.

26:58.077 --> 27:01.623
- Don't you look just like my mother?
- Thas enough fooling around.

27:01.706 --> 27:03.917
Tell her she's got homework to do.

27:04.083 --> 27:06.044
You better do your homework.

27:11.591 --> 27:13.885
Theo called about the chain winch.

27:14.427 --> 27:17.639
He's got them parts sittin' there.
Says he'll go as high as $250.

27:18.223 --> 27:20.391
I changed my mind. I ain't sellin'.

27:22.227 --> 27:24.395
Is not worth $100. You said so yourself.

27:24.771 --> 27:26.689
He's got those boats in dry dock.

27:26.773 --> 27:28.733
He needs the damn thing.

27:29.234 --> 27:32.278
Ain't that the point in AA,
helpin' out your buddies?

27:33.446 --> 27:34.739
"Helpin' out."

27:34.906 --> 27:36.324
Shit.

27:40.829 --> 27:44.207
Besides, if I get that thing runnin',
is worth $250 a month.

27:48.002 --> 27:50.588
Goddamn it! The soda's warm!

27:50.713 --> 27:54.592
I only got home a half hour ago.
It went in first thing.

27:54.968 --> 27:57.470
Is hard enough drinkin' this stuff cold.

28:03.852 --> 28:05.562
Whas so fuckin' funny?

28:06.729 --> 28:08.481
Your pants.

28:08.773 --> 28:11.109
They're split clear the way up.

28:13.862 --> 28:15.864
Well, ain't that a scream!

28:18.950 --> 28:21.619
You're pretty goddamn frisky
all of a sudden, Dolores.

28:24.998 --> 28:29.169
Let me guess. I'll bet that Vera Donovan's
got a whole freezer full of soda.

28:30.962 --> 28:34.007
Take them off. I'll mend them after supper.

28:34.174 --> 28:35.800
Whas the deal?

28:35.884 --> 28:39.637
You kiss that rich summer ass all day long,
you got nothin' left for me.

28:41.514 --> 28:44.976
Just remember, your father used to scrape
my old man's boat...

28:45.143 --> 28:47.770
...so don't be gettin' high and mighty
on me.

28:48.146 --> 28:51.399
If you still had the boats,
we wouldn't need the extra money.

29:00.158 --> 29:01.409
Looky here.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.336
A big old smiley moon.

29:11.753 --> 29:13.213
This is just for you.

29:14.047 --> 29:15.590
Want to see the dark side?

29:16.049 --> 29:18.051
Yeah, I guess it is pretty funny.

29:23.181 --> 29:26.434
I hope you haven't been walkin' around
like that all day long.

29:31.231 --> 29:33.233
Why the hell'd you make me do it?

30:04.764 --> 30:07.517
14 times 4 equals 28?

30:09.477 --> 30:10.728
Go on.

30:10.895 --> 30:12.355
Sure it is. Is 14.

30:12.438 --> 30:13.523
Is not!

30:13.606 --> 30:14.732
You take 14...

30:14.816 --> 30:16.943
...you bend it till it snaps in half...

30:20.905 --> 30:22.907
Could I have another, with raisins?

30:23.032 --> 30:25.493
Not till after dinner.

30:26.035 --> 30:29.581
- You were right about that real cream.
- He loved the raisins.

30:29.998 --> 30:32.292
He said is my best ever.

30:32.625 --> 30:34.419
Mom, the cabbage.

30:34.586 --> 30:36.754
Move it off the heat for me, will ya?

30:37.755 --> 30:38.923
I'm just...

30:40.258 --> 30:42.260
I'm just resting here a minute.

30:42.635 --> 30:44.137
Thas right.

30:44.512 --> 30:47.515
She run her mouth off
till she got tuckered out.

30:50.310 --> 30:52.020
Plum tuckered out.

30:58.276 --> 30:59.444
Mom?

31:00.153 --> 31:01.988
Do you want me to set the table?

31:04.616 --> 31:06.659
Thad be nice. Thank you, dear.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.796
Stay tuned now for Walter Cronkite.

31:20.340 --> 31:25.595
Each girl is representing a lifeguard station
up the length ofAlquinin Beach.

31:26.179 --> 31:28.765
'Algonquin,' you goddamn flylander.

31:38.858 --> 31:42.362
Damn it, that better not be one
of my mother's dishes.

31:45.198 --> 31:47.659
You ought to take a look at this.

31:48.660 --> 31:51.830
You might want to see
what an ass is supposed to look like.

31:52.789 --> 31:54.499
Them guys on the boat...

31:54.749 --> 31:56.000
...always talking...

31:56.084 --> 31:59.087
...everybody saying what a looker you are.

31:59.420 --> 32:02.507
You know what I do?
I come right to your defense.

32:02.841 --> 32:07.428
I say, "Shit, she may be ugly now, but you
shoulďve seen her when I was drinkin'."

32:14.394 --> 32:17.397
My mother warned me
you'd let yourself go.

32:18.731 --> 32:20.942
Fat ass, lousy cooking...

32:23.194 --> 32:25.029
...running that goddamn mouth...

32:27.907 --> 32:30.326
Guess what, Joe? I ain't tired anymore.

32:31.786 --> 32:35.081
You better sit back down,
if you don't want this in your head.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.125
Mommy?

32:41.462 --> 32:42.964
Go on back to bed, honey.

32:43.089 --> 32:46.134
Your father and I are just having
a little discussion here.

32:46.718 --> 32:48.303
Is everything all right?

32:48.553 --> 32:49.637
Yeah.

32:50.138 --> 32:51.389
Isn't it, Joe?

32:53.641 --> 32:55.476
Right as rain.

32:56.561 --> 32:58.062
You go ahead, honey.

32:58.396 --> 32:59.814
Go on back to bed now.

33:00.273 --> 33:01.232
Daddy?

33:01.399 --> 33:02.650
Go on.

33:09.407 --> 33:11.075
Oh, bitch...

33:11.367 --> 33:14.078
...ain't you gonna get a payback.

33:19.042 --> 33:21.920
Go on. All I ask is that you do it quick.

33:22.170 --> 33:24.422
Don't let Selena see the mess
once is over.

33:24.506 --> 33:27.509
You want to run me down?
You go right ahead.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.595
You can be as mean and hurtful
as you want.

33:30.762 --> 33:33.848
But this is the last time
you will ever hit me.

33:34.891 --> 33:36.267
You do it again...

33:36.935 --> 33:39.437
...one of us is going to the bone yard.

33:44.192 --> 33:46.778
Well, make yourself useful, woman.

33:47.779 --> 33:49.948
Bring me a towel for my head!

33:50.406 --> 33:52.784
I'm bleeding all over my goddamn shirt!

34:07.465 --> 34:10.051
That was one lesson he got the first time.

34:10.592 --> 34:12.219
Maybe the only one.

34:16.724 --> 34:18.476
Is been a long day.

34:19.476 --> 34:20.978
You must be tired.

34:22.522 --> 34:24.315
What do you want me to say?

34:24.983 --> 34:26.650
"Thanks for sharing?"

35:01.144 --> 35:03.354
Been looking all over for you.

35:04.564 --> 35:06.357
Is as cold as Christmas.

35:07.025 --> 35:08.526
What are you doing?

35:09.027 --> 35:10.612
I couldn't sleep.

35:12.447 --> 35:14.115
Catch your death out here.

35:14.949 --> 35:16.618
Tell me about Plan B.

35:16.784 --> 35:19.204
I want you to tell me
you've got a plan, Mother.

35:19.287 --> 35:21.873
If is about money, it shouldn't be.

35:23.082 --> 35:25.210
I've got my sociable security.

35:25.543 --> 35:27.879
I can still work. I don't need much.

35:27.962 --> 35:29.339
You need a lawyer.

35:29.422 --> 35:32.800
These guys don't say "get an attorney"
unless they mean it.

35:34.552 --> 35:36.804
Is you I'm worried about, Selena.

35:37.722 --> 35:39.807
Les not get off track here.

35:42.894 --> 35:44.395
You're my daughter.

35:45.647 --> 35:49.317
I know that probably feels like something
better left alone, but is true.

35:50.610 --> 35:52.153
You're still my Selena.

35:52.403 --> 35:55.990
You're still my good girl.
I can't help but be worried for you.

35:56.157 --> 35:58.326
My God, your hands.

36:00.578 --> 36:01.830
Scary.

36:08.336 --> 36:10.588
I guess if you want to know
somebody's life...

36:11.381 --> 36:13.174
...you look at their hands.

36:20.974 --> 36:24.519
Thas what 22 years of Vera Donovan
will do to you.

36:30.108 --> 36:33.027
Mrs. Donovan, I promise
there won't be any boys.

36:33.111 --> 36:34.696
You're excused, Susan.

36:34.988 --> 36:36.447
But Mrs. Donovan, please!

36:36.531 --> 36:38.950
Kook on the bright side, dear.

36:39.033 --> 36:41.452
You may not have gotten the job...

36:41.619 --> 36:44.205
...but think what fun you'll have
telling friends...

36:44.289 --> 36:46.416
...what a bitch Vera Donovan is.

36:50.044 --> 36:51.129
Next!

36:56.384 --> 36:58.761
I've been working since I was 13 years old.

36:58.845 --> 37:03.224
Started by housekeeping in a hotel.
By the time I left there and high school...

37:03.308 --> 37:06.144
...I was cleaning three floors all by myself.

37:06.978 --> 37:10.148
I took care of my father's house
after my mother passed on.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.400
I'm married and I have a daughter.

37:12.984 --> 37:16.488
This is a big house, but I'm a big woman,
and I can do a good job.

37:16.571 --> 37:20.074
I do not pretend to be an easy woman
to work for.

37:22.577 --> 37:24.078
"Dolores."

37:27.665 --> 37:29.959
This house has a number of rules.

37:30.752 --> 37:33.046
I'm sure you've heard them second-hand.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.381
But I'll tell you in person...

37:35.590 --> 37:38.635
...so we can avoid a teary scene later on.

37:39.177 --> 37:43.264
I like all the windows open every day
for at least two hours...

37:43.848 --> 37:46.601
She did have her ways, did she ever.

37:47.352 --> 37:50.980
I don't know where she got them,
but I know she was a prisoner of them.

37:51.064 --> 37:52.857
The silver has to be checked and...

37:52.941 --> 37:57.070
...cleaned every week. It may look clean
to you, but I like to see my face in it.

37:58.112 --> 38:02.116
The tubs had to be scrubbed out every day
with vinegar and baking soda.

38:02.408 --> 38:04.452
Tablecloths, napkins, handkerchiefs...

38:04.744 --> 38:07.163
...everything hand-washed,
ironed and starched.

38:08.206 --> 38:10.542
Mildew was grounds for firing.

38:10.959 --> 38:13.753
The sheets.
Now, that was one thing you didn't...

38:13.837 --> 38:15.713
...ever want to get wrong.

38:15.797 --> 38:18.258
You coulďve cut off
her high-flown snobbish nose...

38:18.341 --> 38:21.302
...and she'd still smell a sheet
that had hung outside...

38:21.386 --> 38:23.054
...from one baked in the dryer.

38:24.472 --> 38:26.474
Excuse me, Mr. Donovan.

38:26.891 --> 38:28.893
Do you have to do that now?

38:29.352 --> 38:30.562
Talk to the Missus.

38:30.645 --> 38:31.980
Her husband...

38:32.146 --> 38:33.314
...Jack.

38:33.648 --> 38:35.567
He only came up once all summer.

38:35.733 --> 38:38.236
Most of which he spent
ignoring her anyway.

38:38.736 --> 38:41.739
She coulďve easily had the clothesline
near the house.

38:41.823 --> 38:44.159
But not Vera Donovan. No, ma'am.

38:44.409 --> 38:47.245
She had to have the south wind blowin'
through her linens.

38:47.412 --> 38:51.416
And that meant trampin' up and down
that hill twice a day when it was fair.

38:54.002 --> 38:56.379
Isn't this glorious, Jack?

39:00.925 --> 39:02.719
Six pins, Dolores!

39:03.428 --> 39:05.597
You know thas the way I like it.

39:06.014 --> 39:07.849
Six pins, not five!

39:10.852 --> 39:11.936
Jack?

39:12.520 --> 39:14.022
Is 4:30.

39:14.355 --> 39:16.191
Don't you want a cocktail?

39:22.697 --> 39:25.366
Three square meals of bitchery
all summer long...

39:25.450 --> 39:27.827
...but I kept my head down
and my mouth shut.

39:27.911 --> 39:29.829
Every week that $40 went in the bank.

39:30.246 --> 39:32.540
There wasn't a damn thing
she could say about it.

39:32.624 --> 39:33.708
Thanks a lot.

39:33.958 --> 39:36.044
As much as she crabbed
that whole summer...

39:36.127 --> 39:39.130
...I must have done something right.
Come Kabor Day...

39:40.757 --> 39:44.135
I'm sure your winter schedule
is rather hectic...

39:44.594 --> 39:47.764
...but I need someone to touch up
the house once a week.

39:48.264 --> 39:49.390
Dusting.

39:49.682 --> 39:51.309
Keeping the mice company.

39:51.976 --> 39:53.561
I could do that for you.

39:54.979 --> 39:56.189
$12 a week was...

39:56.272 --> 39:58.024
...what I had in mind.

40:00.401 --> 40:01.653
Thad be fine.

40:02.987 --> 40:05.406
I'll see you next Memorial Day.

40:12.038 --> 40:14.040
That winter, Jack Donovan passed on.

40:14.707 --> 40:16.835
He died in a car crash in Maryland.

40:17.210 --> 40:19.671
I wasn't sure what to expect from Vera.

40:19.921 --> 40:22.215
Gorry if she didn't show up in high spirits.

40:23.675 --> 40:26.261
I believe I told you more than once...

40:26.594 --> 40:30.181
...I want the welcome mats
with the letters facing out and not in.

40:30.431 --> 40:31.432
Yes, ma'am.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.351
She'd sold her place in Baltimore.

40:33.768 --> 40:36.104
She was moving up permanent.

40:36.896 --> 40:39.023
Get that out of here and put that there.

40:39.190 --> 40:41.860
And take away this disgusting sofa.

40:42.026 --> 40:45.029
It took two days to load in
her majesty's palace.

40:45.405 --> 40:48.616
She offered me full time and I took it.
I took it.

40:49.033 --> 40:51.035
I knew what kind of hell it would be.

40:52.036 --> 40:55.039
Hell ain't something
you get thrown into overnight.

40:55.456 --> 40:57.750
The real hell comes on you as slow...

40:57.834 --> 41:00.211
...and steady as a line
of wet winter sheets.

41:00.879 --> 41:03.047
Snot leaking offyour nose.

41:03.214 --> 41:05.091
Your hands so cold and raw...

41:05.216 --> 41:07.135
...you start wishing they'd go numb.

41:07.218 --> 41:09.721
Is only December.
You know by February...

41:09.846 --> 41:14.726
...the skin's gonna be cracked so bad, ill
break open and bleed ifyou clench a fist.

41:14.893 --> 41:16.227
But you go to the next...

41:16.311 --> 41:20.315
...and the next and before you know it,
those sheets stretch out 20 years.

41:20.398 --> 41:22.400
Nobody made you stay there.

41:22.567 --> 41:26.321
- I needed the money.
- Not in the beginning, not $40 a week.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.490
Thas when I needed it the most.

41:28.573 --> 41:30.658
Not for me, for you.

41:31.242 --> 41:32.744
Thas perfect.

41:32.911 --> 41:34.329
So is my fault.

41:34.579 --> 41:37.707
You think your father cared
if you ever got off this island?

41:37.790 --> 41:39.417
Here we go.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.002
I put that money...

41:41.085 --> 41:44.005
...every week, I put it away
in your account...

41:44.172 --> 41:45.423
...for school.

41:45.590 --> 41:48.259
To get you out of this place,
once and for all.

41:49.511 --> 41:51.513
Well, it worked like a charm.

41:51.679 --> 41:53.014
Hello, ladies.

41:54.390 --> 41:55.850
A little morning walk?

41:55.934 --> 41:56.935
Nope.

41:57.018 --> 42:00.772
Just packing up the speed boat
so as I can make my big escape.

42:01.189 --> 42:03.191
Something we can help you with?

42:05.985 --> 42:07.445
We need a hair sample.

42:07.946 --> 42:09.030
How was that?

42:09.113 --> 42:12.075
We need a piece of your hair.
We're running some tests.

42:13.034 --> 42:14.953
- Are you now?
- Just a strand.

42:15.036 --> 42:16.955
I think we'll take a pass on that.

42:17.038 --> 42:18.039
Look...

42:18.122 --> 42:20.166
...right now is voluntary.

42:20.333 --> 42:22.377
I'd appreciate it, is all.

42:22.544 --> 42:24.170
Bring your scissors, did you?

42:24.295 --> 42:26.297
I said we'll pass.

42:27.215 --> 42:29.467
I'll have a warrant here this afternoon.

42:30.718 --> 42:32.053
You want it...

42:32.887 --> 42:34.305
...you cut it.

42:35.890 --> 42:38.309
Actually, I need to pull it.

42:39.561 --> 42:40.937
We need the root.

42:47.861 --> 42:49.154
Go on.

42:49.237 --> 42:50.822
Take what you want.

42:51.906 --> 42:54.868
I ain't doing any beauty pageants
this week.

43:04.419 --> 43:06.254
- Anything else?
- Mother, enough.

43:06.504 --> 43:09.591
We spoke to Sheila Jolander last night.

43:09.716 --> 43:14.012
She said she'd heard you more than once
threaten to kill Vera Donovan.

43:14.345 --> 43:15.763
Is that true?

43:16.681 --> 43:20.101
If she'd come every day not once a week,
she'd have heard more.

43:20.185 --> 43:22.520
- Get in the house.
- Vera, at the end...

43:22.604 --> 43:25.982
...the way she got, is a wonder
I didn't say it every hour.

43:28.109 --> 43:30.528
You go ahead, Mr. Mackey.

43:30.778 --> 43:33.239
You scribble that down in your pad there.

43:33.698 --> 43:35.492
You make a note on that.

43:35.658 --> 43:38.953
As long as you write down
that saying a thing and doing it...

43:39.037 --> 43:40.955
...are two separate things.

43:42.373 --> 43:44.626
But, your wife probably
already told you that.

43:44.709 --> 43:46.419
Dolores, thas enough.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.217
My wife...

43:52.800 --> 43:54.260
...Ms. Claiborne...

43:54.552 --> 43:57.347
...died 12 years ago of bone cancer.

44:00.558 --> 44:02.435
Natural causes.

44:06.397 --> 44:09.067
Okay, I guess we'll press on here.

44:16.115 --> 44:17.242
Frank.

44:17.617 --> 44:19.494
I want to get into Vera's.

44:19.661 --> 44:22.747
I got things up there I need.
Clothes and my personals.

44:22.831 --> 44:26.584
We can go over tomorrow. We're shipping
out Vera's body this afternoon.

44:26.751 --> 44:28.211
Fine by me.

44:30.672 --> 44:33.091
What the hell did I just see?

44:34.676 --> 44:38.179
Thas the last guy in the world
you want to make an enemy out of.

44:38.763 --> 44:41.182
I ain't making one, I'm keeping one.

44:41.266 --> 44:43.852
What is that supposed to mean?

44:45.937 --> 44:48.439
You're gonna tell me
you don't remember him?

44:54.445 --> 44:57.198
Thas all well and good, Miss St. George...

44:57.532 --> 45:00.702
...but you told me that at the time
of your father's death...

45:00.785 --> 45:04.497
...you were working as a maid in a hotel
at Jonesport.

45:05.790 --> 45:06.958
Yes.

45:07.375 --> 45:08.376
Well...

45:08.459 --> 45:09.961
...Mrs. Devereaux...

45:11.045 --> 45:12.630
...at the hotel...

45:13.631 --> 45:14.966
Remember?

45:16.634 --> 45:18.303
Mrs. Devereaux said...

45:18.553 --> 45:20.722
...she was surprised to see you.

45:20.930 --> 45:25.435
She said your mom was pretty strict about
not letting you spend the night there.

45:26.561 --> 45:28.062
Isn't that true?

45:30.148 --> 45:31.649
I guess.

45:35.904 --> 45:39.240
So why did she let you stay
on that particular weekend?

45:45.622 --> 45:47.832
Problems at home, perhaps?

45:49.334 --> 45:51.336
Your mom and dad...

45:51.753 --> 45:53.755
...is that a happy situation?

45:53.922 --> 45:55.590
Miss St. George?

45:55.924 --> 45:57.509
The eclipse.

46:01.262 --> 46:04.349
Because of the eclipse, the hotel was full.

46:04.933 --> 46:06.851
So the money...

46:07.435 --> 46:10.104
They said that we'd make twice as much.

46:13.274 --> 46:15.443
So this was all about money?

46:16.945 --> 46:18.780
My mom let me stay.

46:19.697 --> 46:22.534
They said that we'd make twice as much.

46:24.285 --> 46:25.870
So your father...

46:26.204 --> 46:28.289
...that was just a coincidence, was it?

46:28.373 --> 46:30.625
How long are you gonna let this go on?

46:30.708 --> 46:34.128
The sooner she starts telling the truth,
the sooner we'll be done.

46:34.212 --> 46:37.799
If he's out to torture someone,
I'd be happy to get back in the hot seat.

46:38.049 --> 46:42.512
Anybody who accuses me of killing
my husband, go ahead and call me Dolores.

46:47.809 --> 46:51.187
Detective Mackey, you understand,
he's just doing his job.

46:51.563 --> 46:53.690
Trying to turn an accident into a murder?

46:53.773 --> 46:57.485
Making a girl who just lost her father
cry her eyes out every night?

46:57.569 --> 47:01.114
If thas just doing his job then
you'd better put him down for overtime.

47:01.197 --> 47:02.907
All right, les split them up.

47:03.908 --> 47:05.326
Slow down, John.

47:05.493 --> 47:08.371
Five minutes, alone, without her.

47:09.664 --> 47:10.915
Enough, John.

47:10.999 --> 47:12.750
I only need five minutes!

47:13.251 --> 47:14.669
I said, "Enough."

47:26.097 --> 47:28.850
So don't be talkin' to me
about makin' enemies.

47:28.933 --> 47:30.810
No, sir. No, ma'am.

47:32.270 --> 47:35.940
That son of a bitch has been waitin'
a long time to pick over my bones.

47:38.026 --> 47:39.277
Hand me that ax.

47:40.904 --> 47:43.990
Just look at this window.
Little piss squirts!

47:44.616 --> 47:48.369
I ought to call their parents
and have them come over and pay for it.

47:49.787 --> 47:51.789
Now I gotta go buy glass and...

47:51.873 --> 47:53.958
...putty and God knows what else.

47:55.460 --> 47:58.254
Could have burned down
the whole goddamn house.

48:05.136 --> 48:07.847
I thought the malpractice story
was the most important.

48:07.931 --> 48:10.225
If you'd left the number
I'd have called yesterday.

48:10.308 --> 48:12.143
Yeah, right. Kook.

48:12.227 --> 48:14.646
The radiologist I told you about...

48:14.771 --> 48:16.564
...he got cold feet.

48:16.898 --> 48:19.234
But, the intern, Levitt...

48:19.567 --> 48:20.944
...he's a talker.

48:21.152 --> 48:23.822
I thought you were going up there
to see your mother?

48:23.905 --> 48:26.908
Is a small domestic drama up here, Peter.

48:27.075 --> 48:28.576
I can be in Phoenix Tuesday.

48:28.660 --> 48:29.744
Ill be over Monday.

48:29.828 --> 48:31.913
Family things, I've been through it.

48:31.996 --> 48:33.248
They take a lot.

48:33.331 --> 48:36.668
I am telling you, is not a problem.

48:37.335 --> 48:41.923
We both want me to do this story.
I'm out of here Monday at the latest.

48:42.423 --> 48:43.758
You want a wet dream?

48:43.842 --> 48:46.177
Wait till I tell you what Kevitt said.

48:48.930 --> 48:50.265
Are you there?

48:52.600 --> 48:54.435
I gave the piece to Maureen.

48:57.856 --> 49:02.110
Kook, I'm sorry. I couldn't wait.
The magazine has to be first on this.

49:02.193 --> 49:04.863
It has nothing to do with you,
you know that.

49:05.864 --> 49:08.241
So, I guess you're fucking Maureen now?

49:08.366 --> 49:10.451
Nice try. Come on, Selena.

49:10.535 --> 49:12.287
You couldn't tell me to my face?

49:12.370 --> 49:14.080
Look, I never promised you...

49:14.289 --> 49:15.748
You goddamn pimp.

49:15.915 --> 49:18.710
- Careful.
- I need this story, Peter.

49:19.711 --> 49:22.380
There are other stories, better stories.

49:22.630 --> 49:25.133
Bullshit. This was the one.

49:26.176 --> 49:27.177
Is over.

49:27.260 --> 49:28.845
Selena, it doesn't have to be...

49:35.059 --> 49:36.728
I'll do this again.

49:51.659 --> 49:55.079
Shouldn't you be off somewhere
analyzing my mother's hair?

49:56.206 --> 49:59.584
Well, I was thinking how hard
it must be for you.

50:00.502 --> 50:02.504
Protecting her like this.

50:05.006 --> 50:09.093
She's a hearty soul, isn't she?
Might just live another 50 years.

50:11.179 --> 50:15.642
Next eclipse is due in '96.
If she gets away with it this time...

50:15.934 --> 50:18.728
...she might actually have
another chance to...

50:19.103 --> 50:22.190
...kill again, before she's through.

50:24.526 --> 50:27.195
Is that something you want
on your conscience?

50:32.367 --> 50:34.536
I had a problem with that myself.

50:36.788 --> 50:41.251
You know, we're probably more alike
than you'd care to believe.

50:45.547 --> 50:47.048
We live alone...

50:47.298 --> 50:48.716
...no children.

50:48.967 --> 50:51.970
We have our work.
My cases are my family.

50:52.387 --> 50:56.641
In 30 years, I've handled 86 homicides.
I've closed 85 of them...

50:57.725 --> 50:59.477
...to my satisfaction.

51:01.146 --> 51:03.398
I underestimated your mother.

51:05.483 --> 51:06.985
It won't happen again.

51:12.907 --> 51:15.368
You sent that fax to my office...

51:17.078 --> 51:18.329
...didn't you?

51:20.832 --> 51:23.042
"For God will bring every work
into judgment...

51:23.126 --> 51:25.420
"...with every secret thing...

51:25.587 --> 51:28.006
"...whether it be good or evil."

51:30.008 --> 51:31.759
You son of a bitch.

51:31.926 --> 51:34.262
Vera Donovan's on my head.

51:35.430 --> 51:37.348
The next one's on yours.

51:50.945 --> 51:52.530
You know, Selena...

51:53.698 --> 51:55.617
...I can't help remembering...

51:57.035 --> 51:59.037
...you were a wonderful cook.

52:00.538 --> 52:01.456
Please.

52:01.539 --> 52:02.790
You were.

52:04.209 --> 52:05.877
I can't even defrost.

52:06.044 --> 52:08.630
You put supper on the table
three nights out of five.

52:08.796 --> 52:10.798
I was working, I'd come back...

52:11.132 --> 52:14.594
...you'd have the house clean,
homework done and food on the table.

52:19.641 --> 52:22.060
You're just out of practice, thas all.

52:25.146 --> 52:28.066
You'll find someone to look after.
You'll see.

52:28.316 --> 52:29.984
Ill all come back to you.

52:31.611 --> 52:33.112
Someone to look after.

52:34.155 --> 52:35.824
You must have boyfriends.

52:36.115 --> 52:39.244
Beautiful girl like you,
smart and out in the world.

52:44.916 --> 52:46.751
Are you tellin' me there's nobody?

52:48.670 --> 52:51.130
I'm telling you there's a lot of nobodies.

52:59.347 --> 53:01.015
Friggin' yahoos.

53:01.975 --> 53:03.768
Come on out here, Dolores!

53:06.062 --> 53:07.772
Friggin' little bastards.

53:07.897 --> 53:11.442
Get off the island,
you goddamn murdering bitch!

53:11.609 --> 53:14.863
Come on down here,
you little ass-picking squirts.

53:14.946 --> 53:18.283
How many people are you gonna kill
before they put you away?

53:18.950 --> 53:22.120
Come on! Come on, you little chickens!

53:22.287 --> 53:23.997
Going to jail this time!

53:24.747 --> 53:26.374
I know who you are.

53:26.541 --> 53:30.128
Chester Lavelier and the rest of you.
Come on down here.

53:30.211 --> 53:32.046
You got something to say to me?

53:32.130 --> 53:34.465
They're gonna put you in the chair!

54:00.825 --> 54:02.327
What are you doin'?

54:04.662 --> 54:06.331
What does it look like?

54:06.414 --> 54:08.833
Selena, you've been drinkin'.

54:09.334 --> 54:10.835
No shit.

54:11.419 --> 54:13.171
I wish you wouldn't.

54:14.422 --> 54:15.840
Look at me.

54:16.341 --> 54:19.177
Look at me. You see how I am right now?

54:22.055 --> 54:23.890
What good is that gonna do?

54:24.390 --> 54:26.184
Because in 10 minutes...

54:26.267 --> 54:28.269
...l'm going to be fine.

54:29.145 --> 54:31.231
Just give me 10 minutes.

54:38.947 --> 54:41.157
Just give me 10 minutes!

54:46.371 --> 54:47.622
God!

54:56.214 --> 54:57.715
I saw your father last night.

54:57.799 --> 55:00.385
Did you help your ma kill your dad?

55:01.094 --> 55:02.136
Murderer!

55:08.226 --> 55:09.394
Who is this?

55:09.727 --> 55:10.979
You fat, ugly cow!

55:11.062 --> 55:15.567
When I find out who this is, I'll hang
your privates from Battiscan Light!

55:15.733 --> 55:17.068
Selena, stop that!

55:18.611 --> 55:20.697
Honey, is gonna be all right.

55:20.905 --> 55:22.073
It won't.

55:24.576 --> 55:27.328
- My God!
- Get away!

55:35.712 --> 55:37.172
It was a bad patch.

55:38.089 --> 55:41.843
You had a bad patch,
and now you're feeling it all over again.

55:41.926 --> 55:43.720
Bad patch?

55:44.512 --> 55:47.265
I had a fucking nervous breakdown,
Mother.

55:47.432 --> 55:49.184
Don't say words like that.

55:50.435 --> 55:52.979
It was a hard time. You got through it.

55:53.897 --> 55:56.608
Oh, what am I doing?

55:58.735 --> 56:00.904
You just needed a rest, thas all.

56:00.987 --> 56:03.281
You snapped out of it just fine.

56:07.452 --> 56:09.162
You can't have one of those...

56:09.245 --> 56:12.373
...and get a full scholarship
to Vassar College.

56:12.916 --> 56:14.375
It was just a bad patch.

56:14.709 --> 56:17.629
I must have been out of my mind
to come back here.

56:27.430 --> 56:29.557
Here! Over here!

56:30.475 --> 56:32.310
What did you do to him?

56:32.393 --> 56:34.354
Nothing, baby. I promise.

56:34.854 --> 56:36.105
Shit! Look at this!

56:52.914 --> 56:54.290
Fuck!

56:54.499 --> 56:56.167
Goddamn it!

57:22.902 --> 57:25.405
Selena, let me take these from you here.

57:26.197 --> 57:28.199
Dolores, I'll take you upstairs.

57:28.491 --> 57:29.951
I'm gonna ask you to...

57:30.076 --> 57:32.537
...step very carefully on the way up.

57:32.704 --> 57:35.039
Still taking blood samples here.

57:35.331 --> 57:37.333
If you feel more comfortable...

57:37.417 --> 57:39.878
...you can always use the back stairs.

57:46.885 --> 57:50.847
John, is it all right if we go upstairs
and get her things?

57:50.930 --> 57:52.348
Go on.

57:52.849 --> 57:54.225
I'm sorry.

58:01.232 --> 58:04.152
He got a search warrant, so...

58:04.944 --> 58:08.239
...had to go through it for evidence. Yep.

58:08.990 --> 58:10.575
Is pretty routine.

58:10.909 --> 58:12.994
Okay, les get this over with.

58:15.038 --> 58:16.498
So...

58:16.873 --> 58:19.751
You can pack up and take anything
thas not...

58:20.001 --> 58:21.878
...bagged or tagged.

58:22.003 --> 58:24.005
I know that doesn't leave much.

58:24.923 --> 58:25.965
Sorry, Dolores.

58:29.511 --> 58:31.763
I'll give you a hand here.

58:49.531 --> 58:50.949
Dolores, is that it then?

58:51.115 --> 58:53.785
No. I got something in Vera's room.

58:53.952 --> 58:55.912
This room's off-limits.

59:00.416 --> 59:02.627
I'm still going through things here.

59:06.130 --> 59:07.799
Ms. Claiborne.

59:09.217 --> 59:10.301
Whas this then?

59:10.510 --> 59:12.428
Is my scrapbook.

59:12.929 --> 59:14.639
Is Selena's articles.

59:15.473 --> 59:17.141
I'd read them to Vera.

59:24.065 --> 59:26.067
Almost got away with it, didn't she?

59:34.159 --> 59:36.494
I read that. Thas good stuff.

59:36.661 --> 59:39.164
You really got him to open up there.

59:41.499 --> 59:42.959
Scholarship.

59:43.251 --> 59:44.586
Vassar.

59:44.669 --> 59:46.671
Very impressive.

01:00:06.399 --> 01:00:08.193
Jeezly crow.

01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:14.991
Couldn't you clean up after her?

01:00:15.074 --> 01:00:17.535
- What kind of people are you?
- You put that back!

01:00:17.827 --> 01:00:19.662
You'll tell me this is evidence?

01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:23.082
- Thas exactly what I'm telling you.
- Dolores, you put that down.

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:27.003
Goddamn it!

01:00:27.253 --> 01:00:30.548
I'm tryin' to do you a favor here
and thas the way you act?

01:00:31.049 --> 01:00:34.511
I ain't leavin' here without my scrapbook.

01:00:36.804 --> 01:00:38.306
Sorry, John.

01:00:41.518 --> 01:00:44.646
I'll see you day after tomorrow,
9:00 a.m. At the town hall.

01:00:44.813 --> 01:00:47.565
Don't put your fur up, Frank. I'll be there.

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:52.403
I have a feeling we could wrap this up
right now.

01:00:52.654 --> 01:00:54.739
Is not gonna be like last time.

01:00:58.159 --> 01:00:59.244
Is that so?

01:00:59.452 --> 01:01:01.579
Les just go. Okay?

01:01:03.331 --> 01:01:07.168
Now you listen to me, Mister Grand High
Poobah of Upper Butt Crack.

01:01:07.335 --> 01:01:10.505
I'm just about half past give a shit
with your fun and games.

01:01:10.588 --> 01:01:14.634
My husbanďs death was ruled an accident
and you know it better than anyone.

01:01:14.759 --> 01:01:18.054
"Death by misadventure," to be exact.

01:01:18.263 --> 01:01:20.431
I'm sure there's people who'd tell you...

01:01:20.515 --> 01:01:22.725
...I had plenty of reasons to kill Joe.

01:01:22.809 --> 01:01:25.103
But Vera, why the hell would I kill her?

01:01:25.562 --> 01:01:27.397
All I am is out of a job...

01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:29.315
...a nice room to sleep in.

01:01:29.607 --> 01:01:31.985
You don't need a job, do you?

01:01:32.861 --> 01:01:34.112
Motive?

01:01:35.113 --> 01:01:39.576
I'd say $1,600,000...

01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:41.202
...is quite a motive.

01:01:41.786 --> 01:01:42.787
What?

01:01:42.871 --> 01:01:44.998
Your mother's a wealthy woman, Selena.

01:01:49.377 --> 01:01:51.379
What the hell are you talkin' about?

01:01:51.462 --> 01:01:54.382
I spoke to Vera's lawyer
in Baltimore last night.

01:01:54.465 --> 01:01:55.383
John.

01:01:55.466 --> 01:01:57.719
- She left you everything.
- Look, John...

01:01:57.844 --> 01:01:59.470
Every last cent.

01:02:01.639 --> 01:02:03.641
She can't do that.

01:02:05.643 --> 01:02:06.895
You're lyin'.

01:02:06.978 --> 01:02:08.980
You're a millionaire, Ms. Claiborne.

01:02:09.397 --> 01:02:10.648
Wait a minute.

01:02:10.982 --> 01:02:14.152
- This isn't the place to be bringing...
- Back off.

01:02:14.611 --> 01:02:16.029
He's crazy.

01:02:16.988 --> 01:02:18.656
Thas plain crazy.

01:02:21.326 --> 01:02:23.244
She'd never do that.

01:02:23.328 --> 01:02:25.955
Did she keep it a secret
from you, too, Selena?

01:02:26.247 --> 01:02:28.500
Or maybe you knew about it.

01:02:29.167 --> 01:02:31.002
Because this will...

01:02:31.753 --> 01:02:33.171
I mean, hell...

01:02:33.296 --> 01:02:35.840
...is only eight years old.

01:02:37.842 --> 01:02:38.843
Frank!

01:02:41.054 --> 01:02:44.015
You want to wait for the District Attorney
Monday morning?

01:02:44.098 --> 01:02:46.518
Or should we take care of this now?

01:02:58.822 --> 01:03:00.448
Get in the car, Mother.

01:03:02.951 --> 01:03:05.703
Get in the goddamn car!

01:03:17.549 --> 01:03:19.717
You had no idea she left you the money?

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.344
I swear it.

01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:24.055
Over $1,000,000.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:27.517
That bitch. The malicious,
high-flown, harpin' bitch!

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.269
Cut the bullshit!

01:03:31.187 --> 01:03:33.022
You can afford a lawyer now.

01:03:39.737 --> 01:03:40.905
Car trouble?

01:03:41.114 --> 01:03:43.741
We're quite fine, thank you.

01:03:47.078 --> 01:03:48.830
I wish I had killed her.

01:03:50.081 --> 01:03:51.749
Leavin' me that money.

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:54.711
I wish I had!

01:03:56.379 --> 01:03:58.256
I wish I had killed her!

01:04:10.518 --> 01:04:12.729
What happened in that house?

01:04:18.026 --> 01:04:19.527
Dolores.

01:04:28.119 --> 01:04:29.954
Hell's bells.

01:04:32.123 --> 01:04:33.416
Look who's up.

01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:41.799
I'm wet.

01:04:43.301 --> 01:04:44.761
What else is new?

01:04:44.886 --> 01:04:47.305
How long this time?

01:04:48.139 --> 01:04:51.017
Since you last made sense?
About two days, I guess.

01:04:51.267 --> 01:04:55.104
Just leave me wet, don't you?

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:59.609
When I'm not thinking straight enough
to keep on you.

01:05:02.028 --> 01:05:04.030
Thas what you do...

01:05:04.197 --> 01:05:05.532
...isn't it?

01:05:05.615 --> 01:05:09.619
Yeah, is a regular party around here
when you're snoozin'.

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:12.831
Where's my china pig?

01:05:13.206 --> 01:05:16.543
There's only 200 of them around.
Which one you want?

01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:20.046
Are you being smart?

01:05:20.255 --> 01:05:24.133
No, Vera. If I'd been smart, I'd have done
workin' for you a long time ago.

01:05:24.217 --> 01:05:26.719
Les see what you got left.

01:05:28.221 --> 01:05:31.599
Goddamn it! Are you gonna sit here
and marinate in it? Come on.

01:05:34.144 --> 01:05:37.188
You're gonna get on this fanny pan
one way or another.

01:05:37.355 --> 01:05:38.565
Come on.

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:41.651
There we go.

01:05:43.736 --> 01:05:46.364
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

01:05:49.742 --> 01:05:51.870
Now hold on with your good arm.

01:05:51.995 --> 01:05:53.830
Hold on this time.

01:05:53.913 --> 01:05:55.748
Push with your good leg.

01:05:56.374 --> 01:05:59.169
I don't know why you make me do this.

01:06:03.047 --> 01:06:05.508
I hate this nightgown.

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:10.180
Your days of silk and satin are over, Vera.

01:06:10.722 --> 01:06:13.183
From now on is wash "n" wear.

01:06:18.438 --> 01:06:20.148
You're poisoning me...

01:06:20.231 --> 01:06:21.983
...aren't you, Dolores?

01:06:22.317 --> 01:06:23.693
Slow...

01:06:23.776 --> 01:06:25.195
...but sure.

01:06:25.278 --> 01:06:27.155
Thas what you're doing.

01:06:27.447 --> 01:06:28.740
No, ma'am.

01:06:28.865 --> 01:06:31.784
When I'm ready to settle your hash,
I won't use poison.

01:06:31.868 --> 01:06:36.456
I'll just shove you out the window. There'll
be one less smelly bitch in the world.

01:06:41.836 --> 01:06:44.047
Don't we have a hair...

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:47.050
...across our ass today.

01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:49.469
Dolores Claiborne.

01:06:53.306 --> 01:06:55.433
I want my china pig!

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:58.228
Get off your royal duff and go and get it.

01:06:58.311 --> 01:07:00.230
We both know you can do it.

01:07:00.313 --> 01:07:01.481
Do you good.

01:07:01.648 --> 01:07:02.732
You need the exercise.

01:07:02.816 --> 01:07:04.484
What I need...

01:07:04.901 --> 01:07:08.738
...is someone who'll do as they're told!

01:07:09.405 --> 01:07:10.907
Don't go too far, Vera.

01:07:11.157 --> 01:07:13.660
I'll go as far...

01:07:14.577 --> 01:07:17.247
...as I damn well want!

01:07:18.623 --> 01:07:19.833
Yes.

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.668
I will!

01:07:26.464 --> 01:07:28.007
If this...

01:07:28.424 --> 01:07:31.970
...is whas going to pass as living...

01:07:33.346 --> 01:07:37.517
...l'll damn well say what I want!

01:07:37.684 --> 01:07:40.520
"Oh, this little piggy had champagne.

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:42.730
"This little piggy ate beans."

01:07:42.814 --> 01:07:45.316
I'll fix you some tea. You'll feel better.

01:07:45.525 --> 01:07:46.860
No!

01:07:46.943 --> 01:07:48.611
I won't.

01:07:51.447 --> 01:07:53.992
I won't feel better.

01:07:54.784 --> 01:07:56.870
I never will.

01:07:57.453 --> 01:08:00.623
I'll never feel better again.

01:09:06.104 --> 01:09:07.857
Oh, my God.

01:09:31.673 --> 01:09:33.633
What the hell are you doing?

01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:38.138
Get out of my way, Dolores.

01:09:38.638 --> 01:09:40.807
Where do you think you're going?

01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:45.478
What in Goďs name has gotten into you?

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:49.607
Let go of me, Dolores!

01:09:52.902 --> 01:09:54.529
Leave me go!

01:10:12.463 --> 01:10:13.506
Oh, my God!

01:10:18.678 --> 01:10:20.221
Oh, my God.

01:10:21.473 --> 01:10:22.849
Don't try to talk.

01:10:23.766 --> 01:10:25.477
I'm going to go call the doctor.

01:10:25.727 --> 01:10:27.520
No doctor.

01:10:27.729 --> 01:10:28.855
No hospital.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.899
You're gonna be all right, Vera.

01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:34.444
You just lie still, don't move.

01:10:34.777 --> 01:10:36.529
You're gonna be fine.

01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:42.035
Dolores Claiborne says I'm gonna be fine.

01:10:42.911 --> 01:10:44.871
What a relief it is...

01:10:45.038 --> 01:10:47.957
...to have a professional opinion.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:50.460
Why?

01:10:51.044 --> 01:10:53.213
Why'd you do this, Vera?

01:10:53.379 --> 01:10:55.673
- Why?
- Because...

01:10:55.798 --> 01:10:57.383
...I hate...

01:10:57.884 --> 01:11:00.595
...the smell of being old.

01:11:01.513 --> 01:11:03.306
I'm tired...

01:11:03.473 --> 01:11:05.725
...and I want to be done.

01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:09.979
Will you help me, Dolores?

01:11:11.147 --> 01:11:13.525
Will you please...

01:11:14.317 --> 01:11:16.236
...help me die?

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:21.199
Don't let me die in some hospital.

01:11:22.242 --> 01:11:23.827
Kill me now.

01:11:43.513 --> 01:11:46.724
If you really want to help me...

01:11:48.017 --> 01:11:50.270
...please hurry.

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:55.358
Dolores, got a certified letter here.

01:12:02.031 --> 01:12:04.033
You don't believe me, do you?

01:12:05.201 --> 01:12:07.245
You think I killed her.

01:12:07.579 --> 01:12:09.956
What I think doesn't mean shit.

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:14.586
Is the rest of the world
you better start worrying about.

01:12:31.853 --> 01:12:34.063
I made a list of attorneys.

01:12:36.065 --> 01:12:38.485
These are all the big muscle firms
in New York.

01:12:38.651 --> 01:12:41.279
It could take a couple of days,
thas why on Monday...

01:12:41.362 --> 01:12:43.781
...you're not gonna say a word.

01:12:45.825 --> 01:12:46.993
Take it.

01:13:04.427 --> 01:13:07.222
In case you missed it,
I'm trying to help you.

01:13:07.889 --> 01:13:11.392
You think I give a fiddler's fuck
what anybody else says about me?

01:13:11.643 --> 01:13:13.144
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:13.311 --> 01:13:14.646
Is you.

01:13:14.813 --> 01:13:17.482
What you think is the only thing left
thas important.

01:13:17.607 --> 01:13:19.651
I can't send you to prison.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.529
You think thas the end of the world?

01:13:22.862 --> 01:13:24.823
Gorry, thad be a relief.

01:13:25.031 --> 01:13:26.533
Sit and sleep...

01:13:26.825 --> 01:13:28.284
...three meals served every day.

01:13:28.368 --> 01:13:31.120
Maybe you're just happier being miserable.
Is that it?

01:13:31.746 --> 01:13:32.914
Is that it, Mother?

01:13:34.332 --> 01:13:36.042
If it makes it easier for you.

01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:40.338
Vera's a bitch. She's abusive,
she's mean, she's cheap.

01:13:40.839 --> 01:13:41.965
Why not leave?

01:13:42.131 --> 01:13:43.800
Why not just walk?

01:13:43.883 --> 01:13:45.552
Like they do in New York?

01:13:46.678 --> 01:13:48.263
Someone hurts me...

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.056
...I leave.

01:13:50.348 --> 01:13:53.309
Believe me, I learned that long
before I got to New York.

01:13:54.769 --> 01:13:56.729
I'm not the one that hurt you.

01:13:57.272 --> 01:13:59.899
What is that supposed to mean?

01:14:01.401 --> 01:14:03.069
You're blaming him?

01:14:03.403 --> 01:14:05.572
Is that what we're into now?

01:14:06.739 --> 01:14:08.408
He was a drunk.

01:14:08.992 --> 01:14:11.286
Barely got out of his own way.

01:14:12.745 --> 01:14:13.746
Fine...

01:14:13.913 --> 01:14:15.707
...maybe he hit you.

01:14:15.874 --> 01:14:17.584
I don't remember it.

01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:20.712
You don't seem to remember
much of anything.

01:14:20.795 --> 01:14:24.132
But then, he's not exactly around
to defend himself, is he?

01:14:30.305 --> 01:14:33.016
You honest to God don't remember,
do you?

01:14:35.602 --> 01:14:36.895
Look.

01:14:40.565 --> 01:14:42.442
Here's the goddamn list.

01:14:43.234 --> 01:14:44.986
You do what you want with it.

01:14:45.069 --> 01:14:47.030
Thas why you're so unsettled, ain't it?

01:14:47.113 --> 01:14:48.448
Unsettled?

01:14:48.823 --> 01:14:51.326
Don't you mean "boogery," Mother?

01:14:51.951 --> 01:14:54.120
If you're attempting
a meaningful analysis...

01:14:54.204 --> 01:14:56.164
...perhaps we'd best define our terms.

01:14:56.331 --> 01:14:58.500
A cornerstone of critical thinking...

01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:00.752
...is communicating
with an agreed vocabulary.

01:15:00.835 --> 01:15:02.378
Go have another drink.

01:15:02.504 --> 01:15:04.964
No, I've had my fun for the night.

01:15:07.717 --> 01:15:12.472
You sit down right this minute
and you can just stow that Vassar shit.

01:15:19.354 --> 01:15:21.940
We're gonna sit down at this table,
you and me...

01:15:22.482 --> 01:15:23.900
...and we're gonna have a drink.

01:15:23.983 --> 01:15:25.693
When we're through...

01:15:25.777 --> 01:15:26.986
When I'm through...

01:15:27.153 --> 01:15:31.991
...you can run upstairs and take whichever
of those little pills makes you feel the best.

01:15:49.425 --> 01:15:51.678
Don't say a goddamn word.

01:15:55.557 --> 01:15:57.934
Before you get too deep in that
to make sense...

01:15:58.017 --> 01:16:00.103
...take a look at her report card.

01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:01.771
I saw it.

01:16:02.522 --> 01:16:03.690
So what?

01:16:04.482 --> 01:16:06.359
Everybody slips now and then.

01:16:06.484 --> 01:16:07.694
Can I be excused?

01:16:07.819 --> 01:16:09.779
Not till you say how an honor student...

01:16:09.863 --> 01:16:11.614
...who skips the seventh grade...

01:16:11.698 --> 01:16:15.451
...goes from straight A's to C's and D's
in two semesters.

01:16:15.535 --> 01:16:17.328
Will you leave her alone already?

01:16:17.412 --> 01:16:20.206
Is not like you were some great genius
at school.

01:16:21.541 --> 01:16:25.503
No Claiborne wasn't even born
in a hospital, for chrissake.

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:27.338
May I please be excused?

01:16:27.422 --> 01:16:28.798
No, you may not.

01:16:29.007 --> 01:16:31.217
Yes, you may. Go right ahead, dear.

01:16:37.599 --> 01:16:38.933
Thanks a lot.

01:16:39.058 --> 01:16:40.894
You better learn to stow it.

01:16:40.977 --> 01:16:42.937
You'll drive her right out the door.

01:16:56.367 --> 01:16:58.578
Mom, what are you doing here?

01:16:58.661 --> 01:17:02.832
Thought you and I might ride back
on the ferry together. You mind company?

01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:12.258
Beautiful, ain't it?

01:17:15.762 --> 01:17:18.264
You used to be beautiful too.

01:17:20.099 --> 01:17:21.976
Why ain't you anymore?

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:26.898
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

01:17:35.782 --> 01:17:37.575
Is drugs, ain't it?

01:17:39.285 --> 01:17:40.912
You've changed.

01:17:41.788 --> 01:17:43.706
You're 13 years old, you're smoking pot.

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:46.084
Where do you get it?
How long's it been going on?

01:17:46.167 --> 01:17:47.627
I don't do drugs, Mother.

01:17:50.588 --> 01:17:53.967
Whatever trouble you're in
won't change my love for you.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.887
I can't begin to help you out of it
till you tell me the truth.

01:18:00.431 --> 01:18:01.933
Are you pregnant?

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.643
Get real.

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:07.021
You want to end up like me?
Dumb and stuck?

01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:10.024
Think I push you so hard
in school to stay in a uniform...

01:18:10.108 --> 01:18:13.236
...and clean up after people forever?
Is that what you want?

01:18:13.319 --> 01:18:14.821
I'm not pregnant.

01:18:15.071 --> 01:18:16.281
Then...

01:18:16.531 --> 01:18:18.950
What is it?
What the hell's going on with you?

01:18:19.033 --> 01:18:21.202
- Leave me alone.
- I won't leave you alone.

01:18:21.286 --> 01:18:24.080
We'll ride the ferry all day till you say...

01:18:24.164 --> 01:18:25.081
...whas wrong.

01:18:25.165 --> 01:18:26.124
Leave me be!

01:18:26.207 --> 01:18:28.710
- Why won't you talk to me?
- Don't touch me!

01:18:28.793 --> 01:18:29.711
What?

01:18:29.794 --> 01:18:31.337
Stop it!

01:18:32.213 --> 01:18:33.548
I got you.

01:18:34.465 --> 01:18:36.134
Get off of me!

01:18:36.426 --> 01:18:38.678
What is the matter with you?

01:18:39.137 --> 01:18:40.680
Talk to me!

01:18:42.348 --> 01:18:44.142
Where did you get this?

01:18:44.476 --> 01:18:45.977
Whare you doin'?

01:18:46.186 --> 01:18:48.605
This is your grandma St. George's cameo.

01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:50.773
- Is mine.
- What did you do?

01:18:50.857 --> 01:18:52.442
Did you go in your father's closet?

01:18:52.525 --> 01:18:53.610
Mom, please...

01:18:53.693 --> 01:18:57.530
- Selena, did you steal this?
- No! Is mine.

01:19:05.371 --> 01:19:06.623
Oh, my God.

01:19:38.863 --> 01:19:41.366
As you can see, Mrs. St. George...

01:19:42.909 --> 01:19:45.745
...this accouns been closed out
by your husband.

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:47.413
How can that be?

01:19:48.414 --> 01:19:52.752
Thas my life savings. How can that be
when I got the passbook right here?

01:19:52.919 --> 01:19:54.963
You see, Mrs. St. George, that is...

01:19:55.255 --> 01:19:58.424
...was what we call
a custodial savings account.

01:19:58.716 --> 01:20:02.554
That means either parent
can countersign and make a withdrawal.

01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:06.141
This doesn't show any withdrawals.

01:20:06.641 --> 01:20:09.352
How'd he get the money
without the goddamn passbook?

01:20:09.561 --> 01:20:11.229
Mrs. St. George...

01:20:11.437 --> 01:20:14.107
...if I could ask you
to keep your voice down.

01:20:15.942 --> 01:20:19.946
According to this, your husband stated,
"Passbook was lost."

01:20:21.281 --> 01:20:23.324
He asked to be issued a new one.

01:20:23.449 --> 01:20:24.826
Is common enough.

01:20:24.909 --> 01:20:27.579
Common be damned.
I opened this account!

01:20:27.745 --> 01:20:30.540
Who do you think put the money
in the bank to begin with?

01:20:30.623 --> 01:20:32.667
Please, Mrs. St. George.

01:20:33.376 --> 01:20:36.588
I'm sorry, but I assure you
what we did was not only legal...

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.756
...but standard bank practice.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.884
Maybe is legal and maybe it ain't.

01:20:40.967 --> 01:20:43.928
I can't believe standard practice
means you don't make...

01:20:44.012 --> 01:20:46.014
...one single goddamn phone call...

01:20:46.097 --> 01:20:48.516
...to the person whose name
is on the account.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.226
I'm very sorry...

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:54.814
Say you're sorry again, I'll kick your butt
till you look like a hunchback.

01:20:58.151 --> 01:20:58.902
Lydia.

01:21:09.329 --> 01:21:11.498
Is cause I'm a woman, ain't it?

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:17.921
If I'd been the one passing off a fairy story
how I'd lost the passbook...

01:21:18.004 --> 01:21:19.589
...and asked for a new one...

01:21:19.672 --> 01:21:23.802
If I'd been the one who started drawing out
what took 11 years to put in...

01:21:24.469 --> 01:21:26.346
...you would have called Joe.

01:21:33.978 --> 01:21:35.021
Well...

01:21:36.356 --> 01:21:38.149
I suppose is one of two things.

01:21:38.233 --> 01:21:41.444
Either he's buried it in a mason jar
in the backyard, or else...

01:21:42.529 --> 01:21:44.447
...he opened up a new account.

01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:51.663
Mr. Pease...

01:21:53.373 --> 01:21:56.668
You don't have to tell me,
but I hope you'll think for a moment...

01:21:56.751 --> 01:22:01.214
...about the grief and heartache you could
have saved me by making just one call.

01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:08.263
I'm asking you to please tell me
whether he's opened a new account here...

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.641
...or if I've gotta start digging holes
around my house.

01:22:18.064 --> 01:22:22.277
As soon as the luncheon silver is clean,
I want the guest rooms aired out.

01:22:22.735 --> 01:22:27.073
I'll want to go over the linens
for the daybeds in the study...

01:22:27.532 --> 01:22:28.616
...and the sun room.

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:31.661
No, Joy, I don't like those colors together.
Change them.

01:22:31.744 --> 01:22:34.914
Dolores, did you check on the flowers?

01:22:35.373 --> 01:22:38.585
Must you look so trod-upon, Dolores?

01:22:38.710 --> 01:22:42.589
In 36 hours you will have
the uniquely thrilling experience...

01:22:42.672 --> 01:22:45.550
...of standing at the epicenter
of a total solar eclipse.

01:22:45.925 --> 01:22:50.096
I've got guests traveling 800 miles
for something all you need to do is look...

01:23:00.273 --> 01:23:01.941
Did you see Dolores?

01:23:04.068 --> 01:23:09.073
As soon as the caterers arrive, I want you
to make sure they have everything needed.

01:23:09.282 --> 01:23:10.700
I've made a list.

01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:14.370
I want no last-minute frantic runs
to Jonesport.

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:16.956
Do you hear me?

01:23:21.961 --> 01:23:24.088
Would you put on some tea?

01:23:36.309 --> 01:23:40.605
- Are we quite finished?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Donovan. I truly am.

01:23:40.688 --> 01:23:41.856
"Vera."

01:23:44.442 --> 01:23:47.362
I insist all women who have hysterics
in my drawing room...

01:23:47.445 --> 01:23:49.280
...call me by my Christian name.

01:23:53.576 --> 01:23:56.204
So, enlighten me, Dolores.

01:23:57.789 --> 01:24:02.502
What turns a stone-hard woman like you
into the blubbering mess I see before me?

01:24:06.673 --> 01:24:08.675
Joe stole my money.

01:24:10.218 --> 01:24:12.637
I went to close out my account...

01:24:13.054 --> 01:24:15.265
It was money I'd been saving for Selena.

01:24:16.224 --> 01:24:20.395
$3,000. I went to get it out
and it was gone.

01:24:22.355 --> 01:24:24.482
Well, don't look to me, Dolores.

01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:26.693
All my money's tied up in cash.

01:24:30.905 --> 01:24:33.283
Planning on playing the stock market,
were you?

01:24:33.366 --> 01:24:34.909
I was going to leave.

01:24:37.036 --> 01:24:41.332
I was going to take Selena away with me
tonight before he gets back.

01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:46.713
Well...

01:24:48.506 --> 01:24:50.341
...isn't that dramatic.

01:24:51.342 --> 01:24:54.012
And why, exactly, are we running away?

01:24:57.182 --> 01:24:59.017
Well, go on, Dolores.

01:24:59.726 --> 01:25:01.728
Perhaps is not as bad as it seems.

01:25:02.145 --> 01:25:04.230
Give it to me. Is mine!

01:25:05.565 --> 01:25:07.025
Oh, my God.

01:25:07.192 --> 01:25:09.819
Is your father.
He's been at you, hasn't he?

01:25:09.903 --> 01:25:11.362
What are you talking about?

01:25:11.446 --> 01:25:13.323
- Whas he done to you?
- Nothing!

01:25:13.406 --> 01:25:15.658
- He's been touchin' you, hasn't he?
- No!

01:25:15.742 --> 01:25:17.327
Whas he done to you?

01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:20.163
You've gotta tell me the truth.
Is important.

01:25:20.955 --> 01:25:22.957
Leave me alone!

01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:26.044
You bitch!

01:25:26.127 --> 01:25:28.046
You crazy old lying bitch!

01:25:28.963 --> 01:25:31.257
You're a fucking psychotic.

01:25:31.466 --> 01:25:34.886
- You think I'd make this up?
- This actually comes to you?

01:25:34.969 --> 01:25:38.097
- How can you not remember?
- I remember you hitting him!

01:25:38.264 --> 01:25:39.516
That I remember.

01:25:39.599 --> 01:25:43.269
I remember the blood on his face,
the drinking, the fighting, but this?

01:25:43.353 --> 01:25:47.106
- You're not responsible.
- Mackey's right. You are dangerous.

01:25:47.273 --> 01:25:49.567
- Fuck you!
- You gotta believe me.

01:25:49.734 --> 01:25:51.236
No, I don't.

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:08.503
Don't try and stop me.

01:26:08.586 --> 01:26:10.004
I'm going to the hotel.

01:26:10.088 --> 01:26:12.882
Mrs. Devereaux needs extra help
for the eclipse.

01:26:17.178 --> 01:26:20.640
- I'll be back in a few days.
- We talked about this.

01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:23.434
I don't care what we talked about.

01:26:28.898 --> 01:26:32.569
I don't want to be here when you talk
to Dad about your crazy ideas.

01:26:32.777 --> 01:26:34.237
Come back here right now!

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.905
Just leave me alone!

01:27:52.607 --> 01:27:55.151
For 12 hours sleep, you don't look so good.

01:27:55.819 --> 01:27:58.112
I need to be in Arizona.

01:27:58.571 --> 01:28:01.032
Is a big story and I need it.

01:28:01.908 --> 01:28:03.243
I know.

01:28:05.912 --> 01:28:07.664
I packed your things.

01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:11.251
You had stuff lyin' around.

01:28:12.252 --> 01:28:14.254
Coffee's on the stove.

01:28:48.454 --> 01:28:49.581
What is it?

01:28:49.789 --> 01:28:53.042
Is Detective Mackey's report. Here.

01:28:53.418 --> 01:28:54.794
I don't want it.

01:28:57.964 --> 01:29:00.758
How remarkably brave, Mother.

01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:05.305
I'll make some calls.

01:29:05.722 --> 01:29:08.892
You'll have your phone
turned on tomorrow.

01:29:09.184 --> 01:29:10.727
I'll take the report.

01:29:10.894 --> 01:29:12.687
I'm gonna fax it to a lawyer.

01:29:12.896 --> 01:29:15.607
You can expect a call tomorrow.

01:29:16.065 --> 01:29:18.610
And when you talk
to that lawyer, Mother...

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:21.237
...you damn well better do what he says.

01:29:21.446 --> 01:29:22.822
You'll miss your ferry.

01:29:23.406 --> 01:29:24.532
You want to hang yourself?

01:29:24.616 --> 01:29:27.994
Go into that inquest tomorrow
and start shooting your mouth off.

01:29:38.213 --> 01:29:39.964
I'm sorry, Mother.

01:29:43.343 --> 01:29:47.472
"Sometimes being a bitch is the only thing
a woman has to hold onto."

01:30:27.178 --> 01:30:28.888
Shit!

01:30:34.894 --> 01:30:38.273
I hope I'm doing this right,
'cause I never worked one before.

01:30:38.523 --> 01:30:41.484
Don't these Japanese make
the cunningest little gadgets?

01:30:43.069 --> 01:30:44.487
You're sleeping now, Selena...

01:30:44.571 --> 01:30:47.240
...but I know when you get up,
you're gonna leave.

01:30:48.575 --> 01:30:52.036
By the time you hear this,
I figure you're in Arizona.

01:30:52.453 --> 01:30:54.789
By now is all been said and done.

01:30:56.791 --> 01:30:58.835
You can forget about the lawyer.

01:30:58.918 --> 01:31:01.921
I'm gonna go down tomorrow
and talk to those people and...

01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:05.425
...I ain't makin' a stink about it no more.

01:31:06.176 --> 01:31:09.387
I'm telling you now
what I'm gonna tell them.

01:31:10.054 --> 01:31:12.682
Ljust thought you ought to hear it
firsthand, is all.

01:31:12.765 --> 01:31:15.310
How far has he gone, Dolores?

01:31:17.061 --> 01:31:19.564
She says it ain't never happened.

01:31:20.607 --> 01:31:24.611
And she screamed and cried
and denied it so bad, I know is true.

01:31:25.111 --> 01:31:26.446
I shoulďve...

01:31:27.572 --> 01:31:31.284
The way she's been acting around him,
I shoulďve known it sooner.

01:31:31.618 --> 01:31:32.785
My God.

01:31:32.911 --> 01:31:34.787
How far has he gone?

01:31:37.749 --> 01:31:39.542
He wasn't always like this.

01:31:40.168 --> 01:31:42.545
When we started out
it wasn't a dream come true...

01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:44.130
Has he fucked her?

01:31:48.551 --> 01:31:49.969
I don't know.

01:31:51.471 --> 01:31:52.806
I don't know.

01:31:55.809 --> 01:31:58.812
But if he hasn't, he's gonna soon enough.

01:32:00.271 --> 01:32:03.441
He's working the boats.
He'll be back tomorrow.

01:32:03.733 --> 01:32:05.193
That money...

01:32:06.694 --> 01:32:11.199
I was gonna use that $3,000 to get us
as far away from here as possible.

01:32:11.491 --> 01:32:13.993
And how far is that, Dolores?

01:32:14.369 --> 01:32:16.788
Jonesport? Bangor?

01:32:17.997 --> 01:32:21.668
You've never been more than 50 miles
away from this island in your life.

01:32:23.962 --> 01:32:26.881
How long do you think
it would take him to find you?

01:32:30.218 --> 01:32:34.180
Is a depressingly masculine world
we live in, Dolores.

01:32:34.639 --> 01:32:35.849
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:32:35.974 --> 01:32:37.809
What if you're right?

01:32:39.644 --> 01:32:42.814
Husbands die every day, Dolores.

01:32:42.981 --> 01:32:44.190
Why...

01:32:44.357 --> 01:32:48.278
...one is probably dying right now,
while you're sittin' here weeping.

01:32:49.779 --> 01:32:51.322
They die...

01:32:51.489 --> 01:32:54.492
...and leave their wives their money.

01:32:55.368 --> 01:32:57.495
I should know, shouldn't I?

01:32:58.872 --> 01:33:02.625
Sometimes they're driving home
from their mistress's apartment...

01:33:03.001 --> 01:33:05.378
...and their brakes suddenly fail.

01:33:06.087 --> 01:33:08.047
An accident, Dolores...

01:33:08.882 --> 01:33:11.718
...can be an unhappy woman's best friend.

01:34:04.604 --> 01:34:06.940
Don't you just love the bossa nova?

01:34:07.232 --> 01:34:10.109
I found them in New York.
I just had to have them.

01:34:11.611 --> 01:34:13.404
Hi, how are you?

01:34:13.613 --> 01:34:17.200
There's a buzzer going off in the kitchen.
You'd better check it.

01:34:19.452 --> 01:34:22.789
I'm sorry, Mrs. Donovan.
We're going as fast as we can.

01:34:22.956 --> 01:34:24.541
Oh, please.

01:34:24.624 --> 01:34:26.918
Everything's charming.

01:34:28.294 --> 01:34:30.255
They're callin' for rain.

01:34:30.338 --> 01:34:31.673
Oh, don't worry.

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.925
I'll have my eclipse.

01:34:35.468 --> 01:34:37.512
I'm sending you home, Dolores.

01:34:37.846 --> 01:34:41.474
You've done a wonderful job
and is all under control.

01:34:41.683 --> 01:34:45.979
I want you to go and share this remarkable
experience with your husband.

01:34:46.813 --> 01:34:48.648
He will be back, won't he?

01:34:51.192 --> 01:34:52.652
I suppose so.

01:34:55.029 --> 01:34:58.491
I've got you two eclipse viewers
and two reflector boxes.

01:34:58.867 --> 01:35:01.494
I thought you and Joe might like them.

01:35:04.455 --> 01:35:05.623
I can't.

01:35:07.208 --> 01:35:09.002
Sometimes, Dolores...

01:35:10.462 --> 01:35:14.299
...sometimes you have
to be a high-riding bitch...

01:35:14.382 --> 01:35:15.633
...to survive.

01:35:17.302 --> 01:35:18.970
Sometimes...

01:35:19.137 --> 01:35:21.014
...being a bitch...

01:35:21.347 --> 01:35:24.309
...is all a woman has to hang onto.

01:35:36.654 --> 01:35:38.156
Thank you, Vera.

01:35:40.116 --> 01:35:42.368
Now, go on home.

01:35:43.036 --> 01:35:45.205
Pam and Sheila can clean up.

01:35:45.413 --> 01:35:46.706
Remember...

01:35:46.915 --> 01:35:49.209
...eclipse at 5:00.

01:36:07.352 --> 01:36:09.562
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

01:36:09.729 --> 01:36:12.857
I got some binoculars.
I'm going to find myself a good spot.

01:36:19.906 --> 01:36:21.241
Come on!

01:36:23.827 --> 01:36:24.869
All right!

01:36:31.125 --> 01:36:32.585
Shit!

01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:37.590
You sorry piece of shit.

01:36:40.885 --> 01:36:42.971
What the hell are you doing back?

01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:46.224
Got the afternoon off.

01:36:46.558 --> 01:36:48.017
Welcome home to you too.

01:36:48.184 --> 01:36:50.895
Don't start with me, Dolores.

01:36:51.104 --> 01:36:52.605
Where's Selena?

01:36:54.941 --> 01:36:56.860
She's working at the hotel.

01:36:58.903 --> 01:37:01.072
Looks like you bought out the whole store.

01:37:01.281 --> 01:37:02.699
Whas all this?

01:37:02.866 --> 01:37:05.285
A present to celebrate the eclipse.

01:37:06.161 --> 01:37:07.829
Eclipse, shit.

01:37:08.621 --> 01:37:12.125
I've felt so good lately,
I thought I'd share some of my happiness.

01:37:12.208 --> 01:37:14.586
What do you got to feel happy about?

01:37:26.389 --> 01:37:28.099
Well, Jesus Christ.

01:37:28.641 --> 01:37:29.893
You don't want it?

01:37:29.976 --> 01:37:31.853
I can always pour it down the sink.

01:37:38.276 --> 01:37:42.113
Vera sent us some thingamajigs
to watch the eclipse.

01:37:42.447 --> 01:37:44.282
Yeah, like I give a shit.

01:37:44.699 --> 01:37:46.534
I don't want to fight with you.

01:37:49.871 --> 01:37:52.123
Les just try and enjoy the day.

01:37:52.707 --> 01:37:54.417
That won't be hard.

01:38:10.308 --> 01:38:12.435
That crowd. Looks like D-Day.

01:38:13.436 --> 01:38:14.771
Look at them.

01:38:15.563 --> 01:38:18.316
The whole goddamn islanďs out there.

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:25.949
I hope it rains.

01:38:26.032 --> 01:38:28.576
Hope it comes down so hard
it drowns them all.

01:38:36.376 --> 01:38:38.461
What the hell has gotten into you?

01:38:38.878 --> 01:38:42.882
Ain't nothing gonna happen any more
than a thunderhead going across the sun.

01:38:43.007 --> 01:38:45.885
Eat up, Joe, before the flies beat you to it.

01:39:38.897 --> 01:39:40.857
Okay, here we go.

01:39:44.444 --> 01:39:45.945
Hey, Dee!

01:39:46.696 --> 01:39:50.909
Isn't this what all of you and all the rest
of them fools been waiting for?

01:39:51.784 --> 01:39:54.078
Better get your butt out here.

01:40:11.179 --> 01:40:12.180
Goddamn.

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:21.397
She's disappearing, all right.

01:40:26.986 --> 01:40:29.113
I got another surprise for you.

01:40:30.281 --> 01:40:32.992
Did somebody invent a pill
thall cure ugly?

01:40:39.249 --> 01:40:41.876
You know the money
in Selena's bank account?

01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:46.214
Yeah, well, what about it?

01:40:46.714 --> 01:40:48.341
You took it.

01:40:56.558 --> 01:40:58.476
Don't you look sour.

01:41:03.231 --> 01:41:05.900
- I guess it is pretty funny, ain't it?
- Yeah.

01:41:07.152 --> 01:41:10.029
I fooled you right and proper, didn't I?

01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:12.866
You fooled me about a lot of things, Joe...

01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:15.451
...but I guess I finally caught up with you.

01:41:15.535 --> 01:41:17.871
You already spent $500 of it.

01:41:18.997 --> 01:41:20.832
Whad it go for, Joe?

01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:22.542
Poker?

01:41:23.042 --> 01:41:24.377
Beer?

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:27.839
There you go, selling me short.

01:41:28.047 --> 01:41:29.799
It was set aside for school.

01:41:30.049 --> 01:41:33.887
You blew all our money, you may as well
run through hers, while you're at it.

01:41:34.095 --> 01:41:36.681
School, shit.

01:41:40.768 --> 01:41:43.897
You can't even wipe your ass
for $3,000 these days.

01:41:46.107 --> 01:41:48.860
I spent the day with the people
at the bank.

01:41:49.194 --> 01:41:51.321
It turns out you weren't supposed
to do that.

01:41:51.404 --> 01:41:52.780
Lie to them.

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:54.908
Make them break their rules.

01:41:56.075 --> 01:41:57.744
What did you go and do?

01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:00.955
I got all that money
given right back to me in cash.

01:42:01.331 --> 01:42:04.083
All but the $500 you pissed away.

01:42:04.292 --> 01:42:06.419
So you can just go and fuck yourself.

01:42:06.586 --> 01:42:09.756
That is if you can get that limp old noodle
of yours to stand up.

01:42:11.758 --> 01:42:15.094
I told you what I'd do
if you didn't stop being fresh with me!

01:42:15.178 --> 01:42:16.554
Didn't I?

01:42:17.388 --> 01:42:19.349
You believe me now, do you?

01:42:19.474 --> 01:42:21.684
Yes. Yes, Joe!

01:42:33.154 --> 01:42:34.614
Oh, my God.

01:42:38.618 --> 01:42:39.953
Look at that.

01:42:41.329 --> 01:42:42.622
A star.

01:42:46.334 --> 01:42:47.627
A star.

01:42:47.836 --> 01:42:51.631
You'll see plenty of them if you don't start
tellin' me where that money is.

01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:53.299
Right now!

01:42:53.967 --> 01:42:55.468
I buried it...

01:42:56.344 --> 01:42:57.637
...in the yard.

01:42:59.097 --> 01:43:00.348
Out by the field.

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.102
Les just go get it back where it belongs,
why don't we?

01:43:06.104 --> 01:43:09.607
Believe you me,
there better be every last cent of it.

01:43:10.608 --> 01:43:14.445
You'd better save the big talk
for your pals at the barber shop!

01:43:14.612 --> 01:43:17.031
I wonder if they'll think
you're such a stud...

01:43:17.115 --> 01:43:19.742
...when they find out the only ass
you can get...

01:43:19.826 --> 01:43:22.412
...belongs to your 13-year-old daughter!

01:43:24.289 --> 01:43:27.375
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

01:43:27.667 --> 01:43:32.672
Then how come you look like the devil just
grabbed them little raisins you call balls?

01:43:36.342 --> 01:43:38.720
She's a liar. She's a little liar.

01:43:39.304 --> 01:43:40.847
And a goddamn tease.

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:45.894
How could you do it, Joe?

01:43:48.396 --> 01:43:50.690
After everything I did for her...

01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:54.694
...she's mouthing off like that,
telling lies like...

01:43:55.695 --> 01:43:58.323
When she gets back I'm gonna get my belt.

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:01.409
I'm gonna get my belt.

01:44:01.701 --> 01:44:05.788
The only thing you're gonna get is
a long stretch in Shawshank Prison...

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.665
...for child molesting!

01:44:07.791 --> 01:44:09.209
Goddamn bitch!

01:44:14.214 --> 01:44:17.217
The more you run, the worse is gonna be.

01:44:17.425 --> 01:44:18.927
Get off me!

01:44:27.352 --> 01:44:30.104
You're gonna get your payback now, bitch.

01:44:30.271 --> 01:44:32.816
And is gonna cost you more than money!

01:44:32.982 --> 01:44:34.359
You're mine now!

01:44:47.872 --> 01:44:51.084
Give me your hand
before I fall all the way in, please!

01:44:51.918 --> 01:44:54.462
Help me before I fall all the way in,
goddamn it!

01:44:55.713 --> 01:44:57.799
You don't know what you're doing.

01:44:58.967 --> 01:44:59.968
Where are you going?

01:45:00.051 --> 01:45:03.221
Oh, God, whare you doing?
Dee, come on!

01:45:04.222 --> 01:45:07.016
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

01:45:12.063 --> 01:45:13.398
Please!

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:16.568
You bitch!

01:45:16.985 --> 01:45:18.862
I swear, you're gonna die.

01:45:22.323 --> 01:45:23.783
Help, somebody!

01:45:24.117 --> 01:45:25.869
Somebody help me, please.

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:27.787
Help!

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:30.748
Help, somebody!

01:45:31.291 --> 01:45:33.501
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Nobody can hear you.

01:45:33.710 --> 01:45:37.797
You bitch! Oh, you just better hope
I don't get out.

01:46:10.955 --> 01:46:13.958
The eclipse lasted six and a half minutes.

01:46:14.375 --> 01:46:17.003
They said it was some kind of record.

01:46:17.962 --> 01:46:21.382
It was a lot more than a thunderhead
passing across the sun.

01:46:22.801 --> 01:46:24.636
It was beautiful.

01:46:31.392 --> 01:46:33.061
I burned the dress...

01:46:33.561 --> 01:46:36.272
...and I dropped the whiskey bottle
out near the well.

01:46:36.689 --> 01:46:41.069
I started askin' folks if they'd seen Joe
off on a bender somewhere.

01:46:41.402 --> 01:46:43.863
Besides Mackey showing up
and making trouble...

01:46:43.947 --> 01:46:46.449
...it was easier than I thought.

01:46:53.331 --> 01:46:54.916
Thas what happened...

01:46:54.999 --> 01:46:56.376
...plain and true.

01:46:56.459 --> 01:46:59.087
And I don't care no more who knows it.

01:46:59.921 --> 01:47:02.173
I guess all I do care about...

01:47:03.049 --> 01:47:05.176
...all I ever cared about...

01:47:05.426 --> 01:47:07.720
...is that you're safe and sound.

01:47:09.514 --> 01:47:10.890
I lied to you.

01:47:13.101 --> 01:47:15.019
And I lied to myself.

01:47:16.062 --> 01:47:18.231
Now is time to pay the piper.

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:11.784
Here we go.

01:48:12.869 --> 01:48:14.746
One coffee, $1.

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:18.249
Out of $5.

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:28.134
Okay, one coffee, one hot cocoa,
thall be 60 cents.

01:48:29.177 --> 01:48:31.429
McCrea, it ain't worth half that.

01:48:33.515 --> 01:48:34.933
There you go.

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:17.267
You look cold enough
to climb inside a clam shell.

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:20.645
Here, this'll warm you up.

01:49:27.735 --> 01:49:29.445
Whas wrong, you don't want it?

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:31.156
Is hot chocolate for you.

01:49:31.239 --> 01:49:34.033
Come on, les take the top off.

01:49:35.034 --> 01:49:37.162
You got that little thing I give you?

01:49:37.453 --> 01:49:39.122
Kes have a look at it.

01:49:40.039 --> 01:49:42.375
You know, this is very special, Selena.

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:45.837
My mother got it from her mother.

01:49:46.004 --> 01:49:48.423
You know, I'm not gonna give it
just to anybody.

01:49:48.506 --> 01:49:51.050
Is very special for you, okay, sweetheart?

01:49:52.177 --> 01:49:53.052
Here.

01:49:53.219 --> 01:49:54.387
Take that.

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:56.723
Is a very special thing for you.

01:49:58.099 --> 01:49:59.225
Your hands cold?

01:49:59.309 --> 01:50:01.019
I'm okay.

01:50:02.187 --> 01:50:05.064
- Here, give me your hands.
- I'm fine.

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:09.110
Nobody's gonna see us, sweetheart.

01:50:09.444 --> 01:50:11.237
Here. Come on. Give me your hands.

01:50:11.321 --> 01:50:13.072
My cocoa will spill.

01:50:13.281 --> 01:50:14.782
Oh, gosh.

01:50:16.284 --> 01:50:18.077
I'll buy you another one.

01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:20.955
- Come on, let me dry your hands.
- All right.

01:50:21.539 --> 01:50:23.875
Oh, gosh. Your hanďs cold.

01:50:25.293 --> 01:50:26.586
I can't.

01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:27.921
I can't.

01:50:35.804 --> 01:50:37.514
No, Daddy, please.

01:50:46.356 --> 01:50:49.025
Come on, now. You know how to do it.
I showed you.

01:50:49.108 --> 01:50:52.278
Remember how I showed you?
Nobody's gonna see us.

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.448
Come on, baby.

01:50:55.532 --> 01:50:56.825
You remember?

01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:04.541
You remember how I showed you?

01:51:07.252 --> 01:51:08.336
Please.

01:51:08.962 --> 01:51:10.130
Come on.

01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:13.091
Come on, thas it.

01:51:13.216 --> 01:51:14.926
Oh, thas it.

01:51:15.093 --> 01:51:16.970
You're my good girl.

01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:19.264
I love you, Selena.

01:51:20.056 --> 01:51:21.641
You're my good girl.

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:27.313
You want your change or what?

01:51:32.694 --> 01:51:34.863
No. You keep it.

01:52:08.855 --> 01:52:11.191
I was gonna kill her, Your Honor.

01:52:11.941 --> 01:52:13.485
She tried to do it herself...

01:52:13.568 --> 01:52:15.528
...but she was still alive.

01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:18.531
She begged me to finish what she started.

01:52:20.241 --> 01:52:22.494
I didn't know if I could do it or not.

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:26.206
By the time I got back from the kitchen
she was dead.

01:52:26.539 --> 01:52:28.792
Just your good luck, I guess.

01:52:31.169 --> 01:52:33.963
They tell me you've waived your right
to council.

01:52:34.255 --> 01:52:35.381
Yes, sir.

01:52:35.924 --> 01:52:39.260
I tell you, I've married people
who've brought lawyers with them.

01:52:40.345 --> 01:52:42.222
Les just get this over with.

01:52:44.265 --> 01:52:46.559
Before I sign Detective Mackey's report...

01:52:46.684 --> 01:52:49.896
...there are a few things
I'd like him to clarify for me.

01:52:50.271 --> 01:52:51.689
Ms. Claiborne...

01:52:51.898 --> 01:52:53.483
...I have several witnesses...

01:52:53.566 --> 01:52:58.363
...who say they were present when
you threatened the life of Vera Donovan.

01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:01.407
Now thas true, is it not?

01:53:01.533 --> 01:53:04.994
Why don't you just go ahead and ask me
what you really want to know?

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:07.789
In due time, Ms. Claiborne. In due time.

01:53:08.706 --> 01:53:11.751
- Is it true you made those threats?
- Of course, is true.

01:53:12.043 --> 01:53:13.962
She told you herself on Saturday.

01:53:14.129 --> 01:53:16.339
I'm sorry. This is a closed hearing.

01:53:17.966 --> 01:53:22.011
The woman sitting over there, the one
without a lawyer, thas my mother.

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:25.473
This isn't a trial.
I have every right to be here with her.

01:53:26.975 --> 01:53:28.434
Selena St. George.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:31.855
Don't stop. Les just wrap this up
and get back to the mainland.

01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:35.024
This report is incomplete.
Maybe before you sign off on this...

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:38.236
We're in the middle of a questioning here,
Miss St. George.

01:53:38.653 --> 01:53:40.780
My mother did not kill Vera Donovan.

01:53:41.072 --> 01:53:44.159
Thas funny. I've got 30 pages here
that say she did.

01:53:44.242 --> 01:53:46.244
This thing is totally circumstantial.

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:49.956
I've covered enough courtrooms
to know he's got no hard evidence.

01:53:50.039 --> 01:53:53.293
Circumstantial? Samuel Marchant, page 6!

01:53:54.002 --> 01:53:56.087
Tell him whas not in the report.

01:53:56.171 --> 01:53:59.466
You've had the whole weekend
to get yourself a lawyer.

01:53:59.674 --> 01:54:02.260
What is it thas not in the report?

01:54:04.596 --> 01:54:06.848
These two women loved each other.

01:54:10.101 --> 01:54:11.603
Oh, really?

01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:15.940
Now thas something we'd like to hear.

01:54:16.983 --> 01:54:18.443
Thas something...

01:54:18.526 --> 01:54:21.404
...we definitely missed
in our investigation...

01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:23.198
...isn't it, Frank?

01:54:25.575 --> 01:54:29.120
Why don't you tell us
about this great mutual affection?

01:54:30.872 --> 01:54:32.707
Your personal observations.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.419
How'd they get along when you'd visit?

01:54:37.045 --> 01:54:39.506
Christmas, birthdays, holidays...

01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:44.010
...whenever you could tear yourself away
from your judicial reportage.

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:48.056
Why don't you tell us, Miss St. George?

01:54:49.557 --> 01:54:52.185
When was your last visit?

01:54:56.064 --> 01:54:57.148
Miss?

01:55:00.485 --> 01:55:02.111
Fifteen years ago.

01:55:05.824 --> 01:55:08.159
You must have some memory.

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:12.413
These women were together for 22 years.

01:55:12.789 --> 01:55:15.208
My mother spent the last 10 caring
for Vera...

01:55:15.291 --> 01:55:18.128
...24 hours a day, 365 days a year...

01:55:18.628 --> 01:55:20.088
...for $80 a week.

01:55:20.255 --> 01:55:22.132
You should quit while you're ahead.

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:24.509
He says they hated each other.

01:55:24.759 --> 01:55:28.388
I want to know if you hated each other
so much why you stayed together?

01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.807
There were other jobs...

01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:32.225
...better jobs.

01:55:33.393 --> 01:55:35.395
Why go through 20 years of hell?

01:55:36.521 --> 01:55:38.982
- Why, Mother?
- Please, Miss. This is embarrassing.

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:41.651
You're supposed to be a professional,
aren't you?

01:55:41.943 --> 01:55:43.653
We know I never visited.

01:55:44.445 --> 01:55:45.822
Who did?

01:55:45.905 --> 01:55:49.075
In the past few years,
who else has been in that house?

01:55:50.535 --> 01:55:52.203
Doc Collin came once a month.

01:55:52.287 --> 01:55:54.330
Les not forget Sammy Marchant.

01:55:55.707 --> 01:55:58.793
Nobody else gave a damn
whether they lived or died.

01:55:59.294 --> 01:56:01.254
All they had was each other.

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:03.882
Thas why you stayed together.

01:56:04.716 --> 01:56:07.343
I mean, is that what you do
when you hate someone?

01:56:07.427 --> 01:56:09.721
You trade off your life for...

01:56:10.638 --> 01:56:13.349
...what, 20 cents an hour
just to keep them going?

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.852
Please, all this is very touching.

01:56:16.936 --> 01:56:20.273
But $1,600,000...

01:56:21.316 --> 01:56:23.485
...is a little more than 20 cents an hour.

01:56:23.568 --> 01:56:25.778
My mother never knew about the will.

01:56:26.488 --> 01:56:29.324
Come on, Miss St. George.

01:56:29.491 --> 01:56:32.577
The will is eight years old.

01:56:32.952 --> 01:56:34.287
You were there, Frank.

01:56:34.412 --> 01:56:36.873
When Mackey told her about the will.

01:56:36.956 --> 01:56:38.041
You think she knew?

01:56:38.124 --> 01:56:39.501
He is not on trial.

01:56:39.584 --> 01:56:41.461
Neither is my mother.

01:56:41.878 --> 01:56:43.463
Constable?

01:56:50.637 --> 01:56:53.431
She seemed pretty surprised, I guess...

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.475
...to me.

01:56:59.395 --> 01:57:00.605
Thas how I saw it.

01:57:04.901 --> 01:57:07.445
You want us to believe
that they were best friends...

01:57:07.529 --> 01:57:11.407
...and alone for eight years
and they never even talked about it?

01:57:11.991 --> 01:57:15.328
I think people can keep secrets
a lot longer than eight years.

01:57:15.495 --> 01:57:18.790
A $1,600,000 secret?

01:57:18.873 --> 01:57:20.166
Come on!

01:57:21.835 --> 01:57:24.420
Did you know about the will,
Ms. Claiborne?

01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:27.632
No, sir.

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:33.138
Vera made it pretty clear she was plannin'
on takin' it all with her when she went.

01:57:33.388 --> 01:57:36.975
I figured when she died there'd be
some laundry and a fare-thee-well.

01:57:37.058 --> 01:57:38.726
Isn't that convenient?

01:57:38.810 --> 01:57:40.478
You don't believe her?

01:57:41.062 --> 01:57:43.189
Then I tell you what, Detective.

01:57:43.273 --> 01:57:46.818
We may be in the presence
of a truly gifted criminal mind.

01:57:46.901 --> 01:57:49.529
For eight years she's a heartbeat away...

01:57:49.612 --> 01:57:52.031
...from being the richest woman
on the island.

01:57:52.407 --> 01:57:53.700
So what does she do?

01:57:54.075 --> 01:57:56.744
Does she wait one year
and let Vera drown in the tub?

01:57:57.203 --> 01:57:58.830
Three years starving her?

01:57:58.913 --> 01:58:00.498
You're digging in deeper.

01:58:00.582 --> 01:58:02.333
Smother her in her sleep?

01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:04.002
Drug her?

01:58:05.545 --> 01:58:09.174
My mother's plan is far more brilliant
than that.

01:58:09.757 --> 01:58:15.054
She waits through eight years of bed pans,
sponge baths, diapers and bed sores.

01:58:15.513 --> 01:58:19.017
She waits eight years until Vera's
already got one foot in the grave.

01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:20.351
Then what does she do?

01:58:20.435 --> 01:58:22.645
- We know.
- Thas your theory, isn't it?

01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:25.190
She waited eight years
to throw her down the stairs.

01:58:25.273 --> 01:58:27.317
Yes. To make it look like an accident.

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:31.112
An accident? She ransacked the kitchen
for a rolling pin.

01:58:31.196 --> 01:58:32.197
Calm down!

01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:35.158
How will beating Vera to death
look like an accident?

01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:37.786
She panicked, just as you're doing now.

01:58:44.375 --> 01:58:47.003
Sammy Marchant brought the mail
every day at noon.

01:58:47.086 --> 01:58:48.838
- Why not wait?
- She panicked.

01:58:48.922 --> 01:58:51.633
- She knew she had to finish...
- How do you know?

01:58:51.716 --> 01:58:53.301
Fourteen years' experience.

01:58:53.384 --> 01:58:55.553
- You've never been wrong.
- Not when it counted.

01:58:55.637 --> 01:58:59.474
- Thas right, you're 85 for 86, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

01:58:59.641 --> 01:59:02.977
- One case away from a perfect record.
- This report is the truth.

01:59:03.061 --> 01:59:06.689
Truth? Bullshit! Why don't you tell him
why we're really here?

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:15.990
Go on.

01:59:18.368 --> 01:59:19.744
Tell him.

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:29.087
Because she's done it before.

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:32.841
Wait a minute.
Is there some prior felony here, John?

01:59:38.388 --> 01:59:39.889
No, there's not.

01:59:39.973 --> 01:59:42.100
They wouldn't indict her.

01:59:50.525 --> 01:59:52.193
Eighteen years ago...

01:59:53.862 --> 01:59:55.572
...my father drank some scotch...

01:59:55.655 --> 01:59:57.198
...and fell down a well.

01:59:58.199 --> 02:00:01.244
Detective Mackey didn't think
it was an accident, which is...

02:00:01.786 --> 02:00:03.621
...why we're here today.

02:00:05.707 --> 02:00:07.750
What do you think, Selena?

02:00:11.337 --> 02:00:13.506
I think that I owe you an apology.

02:00:16.718 --> 02:00:18.803
I called you a son of a bitch.

02:00:20.513 --> 02:00:22.932
You said you thought we were a lot alike.

02:00:23.141 --> 02:00:24.559
And you were right.

02:00:25.977 --> 02:00:29.063
We've both spent the past 18 years
prosecuting this woman.

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:31.941
We came out here...

02:00:32.525 --> 02:00:34.319
...I know I did...

02:00:34.611 --> 02:00:36.738
...believing she was guilty.

02:00:37.363 --> 02:00:40.492
We forgot this case is
about Vera Donovan...

02:00:41.034 --> 02:00:42.368
...not my father.

02:00:42.577 --> 02:00:45.371
And what if it wasn't an accident?

02:00:46.206 --> 02:00:47.499
Look...

02:00:50.418 --> 02:00:53.254
...is been 18 years.

02:00:54.672 --> 02:00:57.342
I don't know what this has done to you...

02:00:58.510 --> 02:01:00.970
...but let me tell you, is consumed me.

02:01:02.847 --> 02:01:05.934
I have lived with this every day of my life.

02:01:07.852 --> 02:01:09.395
Every day.

02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.235
But it was wrong...

02:01:15.652 --> 02:01:17.946
...and I won't do it anymore.

02:01:20.532 --> 02:01:23.076
And if I can say that, my God...

02:01:23.868 --> 02:01:25.370
...can't you?

02:01:31.876 --> 02:01:33.670
She didn't kill Vera Donovan.

02:01:34.254 --> 02:01:36.923
You've been out here looking
for a smoking gun.

02:01:37.173 --> 02:01:38.591
There isn't one.

02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.637
All you've got is a 30-page description
of a suicide.

02:01:42.846 --> 02:01:44.430
I'm asking you...

02:01:44.806 --> 02:01:46.266
...as an honorable man...

02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:50.937
...with all of your experience...

02:01:51.855 --> 02:01:53.273
...all that you've seen...

02:01:54.774 --> 02:01:56.359
...would we be here now...

02:01:56.442 --> 02:01:59.821
...if this was anyone other
than Dolores Claiborne?

02:02:01.781 --> 02:02:04.075
This repors the truth!

02:02:29.225 --> 02:02:33.980
I'd like you to know that if you go
to trial with this, you'll fail again.

02:02:34.981 --> 02:02:38.109
You'd better ask yourself
how you want to finish your career.

02:02:38.651 --> 02:02:40.945
I've got a long list of New York lawyers...

02:02:41.029 --> 02:02:45.617
...who'd just love to take you
and this case apart in front of a jury.

02:02:51.039 --> 02:02:52.165
Mother...

02:02:52.290 --> 02:02:54.042
Come on, les go.

02:02:54.375 --> 02:02:56.169
They can't hurt you anymore.

02:02:59.589 --> 02:03:00.882
John?

02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:02.634
This is your ball game.

02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:05.887
I'm gonna leave this up to you.

02:03:13.019 --> 02:03:14.479
Come on.

02:03:15.313 --> 02:03:16.648
Is time.

02:04:18.209 --> 02:04:20.420
Even when is warm here, is cold.

02:04:23.423 --> 02:04:25.884
It won't be like that in Arizona.

02:04:33.099 --> 02:04:34.601
There is no Arizona.

02:04:37.896 --> 02:04:39.647
I don't have to go.

02:04:40.315 --> 02:04:41.983
It was a lie.

02:04:44.736 --> 02:04:46.404
My editor...

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.407
...the story, the book...

02:04:49.574 --> 02:04:50.950
...is all over.

02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:59.417
Do I still have to worry about you?

02:05:05.632 --> 02:05:08.092
I don't know how to feel
about what you did.

02:05:09.594 --> 02:05:10.970
Maybe I never will.

02:05:17.602 --> 02:05:19.562
But I know you did it for me.

02:05:35.286 --> 02:05:37.747
I don't want to lose you again.

02:05:40.333 --> 02:05:41.835
Go on.

02:05:42.043 --> 02:05:44.045
You're not gonna lose me.

02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:48.216
You go on.
