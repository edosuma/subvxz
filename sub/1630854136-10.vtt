00:08.921 --> 00:11.098
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.098 --> 00:12.403
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.403 --> 00:14.797
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:14.797 --> 00:16.755
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:16.755 --> 00:19.715
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:19.715 --> 00:21.717
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:23.153 --> 00:25.373
I don't anticipate
we'll get any pushback.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.983
No.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.638
But just in case, I want to be
prepped for Friday's meeting

00:29.638 --> 00:31.857
with a list of
all the necessa--

00:31.857 --> 00:33.859
what the hell?

00:33.859 --> 00:36.384
Are you kidding me?

00:36.384 --> 00:39.735
No, I'm pretty sure I just
stepped in a pile of vomit.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.085
It's all over my
brand-new Ferragamos.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.608
Listen, I gotta call you back.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.438
Did you do this?

00:47.438 --> 00:50.572
Hey, Jose, I'm talking to you.

00:50.572 --> 00:51.790
Is this you?

00:51.790 --> 00:53.575
Did you make this mess?

00:53.575 --> 00:56.012
Yeah, it was you,
wasn't it, huh?

00:56.012 --> 00:57.231
You know what?

00:57.231 --> 01:00.234
You people are
ruining the city.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.279
Oh, no.
Look at all your garbage.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.673
- Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Clean it up.

01:05.674 --> 01:06.936
It's you?

01:06.936 --> 01:09.721
Tranquilo what?
You want some of this too?

01:09.721 --> 01:11.114
I just want you
to leave him alone.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.420
I don't want any trouble.
- Yeah?

01:12.420 --> 01:14.596
Well, you are trouble, pal.

01:14.596 --> 01:18.600
What? Hey.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.082
Hey, get off me.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.387
That hurts, you dirty--

01:23.387 --> 01:24.954
You mess with anyone
around here again,

01:24.954 --> 01:26.651
I'll make you really hurt.

01:26.651 --> 01:27.913
You understand?

01:27.913 --> 01:29.176
Yeah.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.267
What are we looking at?

01:33.267 --> 01:34.311
DOA's male.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.747
Looks to be in his 20s.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.314
Male was out walking
his dog before bed,

01:37.314 --> 01:38.924
saw the body lying
on the bench.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.144
Thought the guy was sleeping
until he saw the blood.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.667
Shot three times in the back.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.843
Blood streaks on the
pavement over there.

01:44.843 --> 01:47.019
Shot over there,
killer drags them over here,

01:47.019 --> 01:48.325
lays them on the bench.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.849
Buys some time before
anyone notices the body.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.851
- Time of death?
- It wasn't that long ago.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.766
I'd say less than two hours.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.159
So around midnight?

01:56.159 --> 01:58.074
Around then,
this place is deserted.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.162
There's no cameras.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.163
What about a wallet and ID?

02:00.163 --> 02:01.947
No. No phone, either.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.775
Maybe a mugging?

02:03.775 --> 02:06.952
I don't know if our vic
had anything worth stealing.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.390
Bleecker Mission Shelter.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.521
Looks like our vic
was homeless.

02:10.521 --> 02:11.827
Well, if he had
a place to stay,

02:11.827 --> 02:13.089
what's he doing out here?

02:13.089 --> 02:15.004
I don't know.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.267
That's the Venezuelan flag.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.790
What do you want to bet
he's from there?

02:22.577 --> 02:25.928
Give me your tired,
your poor,

02:25.928 --> 02:27.843
yearning to breathe free.

03:17.936 --> 03:20.025
That's Luis.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.245
He's been staying with us
for about four months now.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.377
I knew something
was wrong when he

03:23.377 --> 03:24.726
didn't make curfew last night.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.597
We have a strict
11:00 p.m. cut off.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.251
Luis had never
missed it before.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.122
- What's his last name?
- Morales.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.994
You know what could have
kept him out past curfew?

03:31.994 --> 03:34.257
No, but I can take
you to his locker.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.694
What can you tell us
about Mr. Morales?

03:36.694 --> 03:38.348
He was one of the
greatest kids I ever met--

03:38.348 --> 03:39.654
the kind of person
who'd give you

03:39.654 --> 03:41.003
the shirt off
his back even though

03:41.003 --> 03:43.266
you don't need it and he does.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.836
That's fine. I got it.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.275
Which one of
these bunks is his?

03:52.275 --> 03:54.234
Right there.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.713
- Parents?
- Both dead.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.846
They were killed by police
in Venezuela

03:57.846 --> 03:59.108
at a protest against
the country's

03:59.108 --> 04:00.588
political corruption.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.503
The situation is
really bad down there.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.722
Luis's parents told him
that America was different,

04:04.722 --> 04:06.724
the land of opportunity.
He believed it too.

04:06.724 --> 04:07.986
You don't?

04:07.986 --> 04:09.553
Work here for a week
and then talk to me.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.642
It took Luis months to make
his way up through Mexico.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.905
Then he finally crosses
the border in Texas only

04:13.905 --> 04:15.820
to be packed onto a
Greyhound and shipped

04:15.820 --> 04:18.345
3,000 miles away by a governor
looking to make headlines.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.085
He was on one
of the migrant buses?

04:20.085 --> 04:21.304
Disgusting.

04:21.304 --> 04:23.219
Politicians using
human beings as props.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.743
I think he would have been
better off here than Texas.

04:25.743 --> 04:27.310
Not so much.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.094
I mean, Luis was on the first
bus to arrive in the city.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.183
The mayor's there, greets
them, shakes their hands.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.402
Says they'll all
be taken care of.

04:32.402 --> 04:33.838
But then no follow through?

04:33.838 --> 04:35.362
Not even a little.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.451
Mayor got his photo op,
but then the buses kept coming

04:37.451 --> 04:39.627
and the city never
came up with a plan.

04:39.627 --> 04:43.413
You know of anyone who
might want to hurt Luis?

04:43.413 --> 04:45.850
There was a situation yesterday.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.766
Luis got into a fight
with a man just outside.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.466
From the shelter
security cameras.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.296
Whoa.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.298
Morales could have
been a contender.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.561
Do we know who the guy is who's
getting his ass handed to him?

05:00.561 --> 05:02.432
Facial rec got a hit.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.609
Gavin Stulner, 28,
works in I-banking.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.394
He's got priors
for drunk and disorderly

05:07.394 --> 05:08.612
and assaulting an officer.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.484
Oh, a real stand-up guy.

05:10.484 --> 05:13.182
Ass whooping like that,
that had to bruise his ego.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.924
Maybe he settled
the score later that night.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.842
- That kid was a punk.
- Really?

05:20.842 --> 05:23.627
Because everyone we spoke with
said just the opposite.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.150
No, I'm telling you,
my apartment's right

05:25.150 --> 05:26.195
next door to that shelter.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.501
The whole place is a mess.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.285
And that dude is the
worst of the bunch.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.373
I'm not the only one
in my building

05:30.373 --> 05:31.809
who's had an issue
with him, either.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.507
What was he doing
that was so horrible?

05:33.507 --> 05:34.986
What do you think?

05:34.986 --> 05:37.641
Harassing people,
loitering, stealing stuff.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.774
That's what they all do.

05:39.774 --> 05:42.472
- They?
- Yeah. The homeless.

05:42.472 --> 05:43.865
What?

05:43.865 --> 05:45.345
I know it's unpopular
to say, but they make

05:45.345 --> 05:46.824
the neighborhood less safe.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.391
Half of them are illegal
immigrants who shouldn't even

05:48.391 --> 05:49.871
be here in the first place,

05:49.871 --> 05:51.655
and the other half are
freeloaders or drug addicts.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.004
You sound a little angry.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.179
No.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.224
I'm very angry.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.747
What?

05:56.747 --> 05:59.489
I pay 10K a month in rent
to live in a luxury high rise,

05:59.489 --> 06:01.317
only to end up next to a
bunch of people who treat

06:01.317 --> 06:02.710
the sidewalk as their toilet.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.408
Very angry people
make very stupid choices.

06:05.408 --> 06:09.107
Yeah, especially angry people
who get their asses kicked.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.414
We caught that video
of your altercation.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.155
Big deal. He jumped me.

06:13.155 --> 06:14.548
That's not what we saw.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.028
That doesn't mean
I killed him.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.117
I trade muni bonds,
I don't murder people.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.381
What were you doing
last night at midnight?

06:21.381 --> 06:22.991
I was at a bar in Dumbo.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.428
Took a bunch of the firm's
new recruits out for drinks.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.038
We didn't leave
till after 2:00 a.m.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.823
A place called the Vault.
You can check it.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.172
We will.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.174
You said that other people
in your building

06:32.174 --> 06:33.654
had a problem with Morales.

06:33.654 --> 06:34.916
That's right.

06:34.916 --> 06:38.615
Care to elaborate?
Got a name?

06:38.615 --> 06:40.487
Yeah, I know him.
Name's Luis.

06:40.487 --> 06:43.011
- Are you two friends?
- No, not exactly.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.795
He did a job for me.
It didn't work out so well.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.231
Yeah, we heard about that.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.407
We talked to somebody,

06:47.407 --> 06:48.669
he said you pulled a gun
on him yesterday?

06:48.669 --> 06:50.932
I did.
But it was in self-defense.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.455
How's that?

06:52.455 --> 06:54.718
I hired him to patch a hole
in my dining room wall.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.894
I went into the other room
to take a work Zoom,

06:56.894 --> 06:59.462
and when I came back out
to grab the phone,

06:59.462 --> 07:00.507
I caught him
trying to steal it.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.899
What was he doing?

07:01.899 --> 07:03.074
Hiding it in a bag
or something?

07:03.074 --> 07:04.424
He was holding it.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.295
Said he was just borrowing it
to make a call,

07:06.295 --> 07:07.731
but I'm not stupid.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.211
I grabbed it from him
and told him to get out,

07:09.211 --> 07:11.213
but he refused.
- He refused to leave?

07:11.213 --> 07:13.476
He wanted me to pay him
for the dry wall job.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.609
Had he finished the job?

07:15.609 --> 07:18.525
Yeah, but I wasn't gonna
give money to a thief.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.831
He wouldn't budge,
so I went and got my gun.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.616
My dad gave it to me during
COVID to make sure

07:22.616 --> 07:23.834
I'd be safe,
and that did the trick.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.749
He got right the hell out.

07:25.749 --> 07:26.968
And you didn't see him again?

07:26.968 --> 07:28.404
No.

07:28.404 --> 07:31.233
I have every right to defend
myself in my own home.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.890
Lou, little update here.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.240
So Luis Morales was killed
by a 9-millimeter.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.938
Samantha Morris's firearm's
a SIG Sauer .45.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.810
Not our murder weapon.
- So we got nothing?

07:42.810 --> 07:45.029
However, we checked
Morris's phone records,

07:45.029 --> 07:46.553
and it looks like
Morales did, in fact,

07:46.553 --> 07:48.468
use her cell to make a call.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.599
That's odd.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.775
No, not really.
He's--he's homeless.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.473
He saw it on the table.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.692
It was still unlocked, he
picked it up and made a call.

07:55.692 --> 07:56.998
Do we know who he called?

07:56.998 --> 08:00.523
Number's registered
to a Michael Higueres.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.003
Call lasted a minute 45.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.744
We know anything about him?

08:03.744 --> 08:06.747
He's a journalist living
in Battery Park City.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.533
That's one block
from the crime scene.

08:13.014 --> 08:16.713
Mr. Higueres, I'm Detective
Cosgrove, Detective Shaw.

08:16.713 --> 08:19.542
We'd like to ask you
about Luis Morales.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.370
You know him, right?
- Yes.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.893
I interviewed him
a few months ago

08:22.893 --> 08:25.461
for an article I was writing
about the migrant buses.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.897
He was helpful.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.812
Gave real depth into the
plight of these immigrants.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.206
I mean, they came here
hoping for a better life.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.338
Can I ask you,
did you keep in touch with him?

08:33.338 --> 08:35.515
Yeah, I was supposed to
meet up with him last night,

08:35.515 --> 08:36.951
actually, but he never showed.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.605
That's because he's dead.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.348
Yeah, someone shot him.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.655
I can't believe he--

08:45.655 --> 08:47.396
he must have been
telling the truth.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.658
He really did see something.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.530
What are you talking about?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.575
Luis said he had
a story for me.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.186
Said he knew something
about a murder.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.544
Hey, what do we got?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.676
According to Michael
Higueres, Morales called him

09:06.676 --> 09:09.113
the day he was killed,
wanted to talk about a murder.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.594
He said he saw something
crazy the day before.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.596
Did he say what
this crazy thing was

09:13.596 --> 09:16.077
or any other
pertinent information?

09:16.077 --> 09:17.513
No, he was in a hurry.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.950
Just said it had something
to do with a murder.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.518
He told Higueres they need
to meet up in person

09:22.518 --> 09:23.824
so they can discuss it
in detail.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.695
So if he knows
about a murder,

09:25.695 --> 09:27.349
why doesn't he just
call the police?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.525
He might have been scared
about his immigration status.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.701
And trusted a journalist
more than cops.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.834
Okay, so the guy
sees something crazy.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.750
He reaches out to his
trusted journalist friend,

09:36.750 --> 09:39.187
and he gets shot
before he's actually

09:39.187 --> 09:40.536
able to hook up with him.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.494
According to Higueres,
Morales was a no show.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.148
Looks like he's telling
the truth about that.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.107
We found street cam footage
that shows Higueres waiting

09:46.107 --> 09:48.326
on a bench on the
other side of the park

09:48.326 --> 09:49.850
during the time of the murder.

09:49.850 --> 09:53.941
Okay, so we know that this
crazy thing that Morales saw

09:53.941 --> 09:55.725
happened the day
before he was murdered.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.293
So we need to retrace
his steps that day

09:58.293 --> 10:02.079
and figure out where he was
and what he might have seen.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.258
That would have been what?
Three days ago?

10:07.258 --> 10:08.738
I don't remember
anything unusual.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.001
Luis woke up early,
like always, had breakfast,

10:11.001 --> 10:12.176
and then headed out
for the day.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.264
Where was he going?

10:13.264 --> 10:14.788
To try and find work.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.441
He was determined to afford
his own apartment

10:16.441 --> 10:17.747
so that he could get out
of here.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.531
But, you know,
being undocumented,

10:19.531 --> 10:21.229
the only work he could
find was under the table.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.883
So you have no idea where
he might have been looking?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.667
He picked up odd jobs
and day labor shifts

10:24.667 --> 10:26.756
all over the city.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.889
But now that I think about it,
I did notice

10:28.889 --> 10:30.542
he left that morning
with Obie White,

10:30.542 --> 10:31.979
another one of our residents.

10:31.979 --> 10:34.068
- Is that unusual?
- Not necessarily.

10:34.068 --> 10:38.202
It's just that Obie struggles
with heroin addiction.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.639
Is he here right now?

10:42.772 --> 10:44.948
Looks like he hasn't
been back here since that day.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.909
Obie's a good guy.

10:48.909 --> 10:50.258
No way he'd ever be involved
in something like this.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.607
I'm sure he is.

10:51.607 --> 10:52.782
But all the same,
do you know where he

10:52.782 --> 10:55.437
hangs out when he's not here?

10:57.526 --> 10:59.484
Where there's drugs,
there's murders.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.703
The cost of doing business.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.139
Yeah, generally.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.445
But I don't think that's
the case this time.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.273
This kid Morales seemed clean.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.362
I mean, everybody keeps
saying he was a great guy.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.364
Doesn't mean he
wasn't dealing.

11:09.364 --> 11:12.323
Frank, these guys are dealt
a really bad hand, all right?

11:12.323 --> 11:14.543
This kid comes over here
looking for a new life,

11:14.543 --> 11:17.111
doesn't pick up any good cards
when he crosses the border.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.983
He's punted like a political
football from Texas to here.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.290
He got no family in the States
so he can't get naturalized,

11:22.290 --> 11:23.900
which means he can't get
a good job, which means

11:23.900 --> 11:25.685
he can't make a living wage.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.299
That's our guy.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.611
5-0!

11:39.611 --> 11:41.222
NYPD, stop!

12:00.545 --> 12:01.982
Freeze! Police!

12:33.317 --> 12:34.928
Police! Stop!

12:37.757 --> 12:39.715
Oh, that had to hurt.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.543
All right, come on. Get up.

12:41.543 --> 12:45.329
Let's go.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.896
I didn't have any drugs on me.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.115
Of course you don't.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.464
But we don't care
about that, Obie.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.683
We're the murder cops, Homicide.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.598
Want to talk to you
about Luis Morales.

12:53.598 --> 12:54.643
Homicide?

12:54.643 --> 12:56.601
But--Luis is dead?

12:56.601 --> 12:59.866
Oh, you hadn't heard?
Someone shot him.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.997
I tried to warn him.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.564
Tried to warn him about what?

13:02.564 --> 13:03.826
Ugh.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.744
Look, we're not trying
to hem you up, bro.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.224
We don't want the paperwork,

13:10.224 --> 13:12.182
and you don't want to go
to jail, am I right?

13:12.182 --> 13:13.836
Okay, so just
shoot us straight,

13:13.836 --> 13:15.533
and we'll look the other way
on the possession charge.

13:15.533 --> 13:16.752
But you gotta
tell us everything

13:16.752 --> 13:19.537
that you know right now.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.061
Talk!

13:21.061 --> 13:23.672
The last time I saw Luis
was a few days ago.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.195
He was going out to find work,

13:25.195 --> 13:27.502
and he wanted to bring me
with him.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.852
He was trying to keep me busy,
help me stay sober.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.159
What were you trying
to warn him about?

13:32.159 --> 13:33.725
We went to look
for work down at this

13:33.725 --> 13:35.379
big construction site downtown.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.555
I mean, they're building one
of those giant skyscrapers.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.035
Okay. Okay, keep going.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.689
We had worked there before,

13:40.689 --> 13:42.212
a lot of guys
at the shelter too.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.866
The foreman down there,
he likes hiring guys

13:43.866 --> 13:45.607
on the fringe, you know?

13:45.607 --> 13:47.783
Illegals, deadbeats.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.132
They pay us in cash.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.481
No union rules.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.309
No union wages.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.789
Exactly.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.878
Pennies on the dollar
for the same damn work.

13:55.878 --> 14:00.056
So you go over to the
construction site and?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.886
We saw something
we shouldn't have seen.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.517
You're the foreman,
Randall Tully?

14:26.517 --> 14:28.345
Yeah. Can I help you?

14:28.345 --> 14:29.956
NYPD.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.827
We need you to shut down
all work immediately.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.307
On what authority?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.004
The Supreme Court
of the State of New York.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.190
Detectives,
I found something.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.240
That's a skull.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.677
There's the torso.
Those are the legs.

14:55.677 --> 14:56.983
All still attached?

14:56.983 --> 14:58.941
Yes.
Body looks fully intact.

14:58.941 --> 14:59.942
So does the other one.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.813
- Other one?
- Yes.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.728
There are two bodies. See?

15:03.728 --> 15:04.947
Right here.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.046
Our techs were
working all night

15:17.046 --> 15:19.353
excavating those two bodies
we found in the foundation.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.398
They're getting
an autopsy right now.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.009
So why don't you just
do yourself a favor

15:23.009 --> 15:24.836
and tell us who they are?

15:24.836 --> 15:26.926
I--I--I don't know
anything about that.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.538
Randall, we got a witness
who saw you

15:30.538 --> 15:32.105
pour the concrete
over the bodies.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.847
Showed up at the site that
morning with Luis Morales.

15:35.847 --> 15:38.285
The witness saw what he saw,
freaked out, and took off.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.851
But Luis stayed, didn't he?

15:39.851 --> 15:42.898
He stayed and he
confronted you, didn't he?

15:42.898 --> 15:45.379
That why you killed him?

15:45.379 --> 15:47.859
I'm sorry, I--I don't know
who you're talking about.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.081
You don't know Luis?

15:52.081 --> 15:54.605
You gonna stick
with that story?

15:54.605 --> 15:56.477
Because we found some
really interesting things

15:56.477 --> 15:57.826
in his apartment.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.959
Oh, you didn't
know that, did you?

15:59.959 --> 16:04.311
Yeah, he got out of the
shelter, got his own place.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.791
You know what we found there?

16:06.791 --> 16:08.097
His journal.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.881
It's a treasure trove.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.405
You know what
he was putting in there?

16:11.405 --> 16:13.494
He was writing down all
the stuff he was doing,

16:13.494 --> 16:15.887
the people he was meeting,
how he was working

16:15.887 --> 16:18.716
for the number-one developer
in New York City.

16:21.023 --> 16:24.113
Randall, he had a phone
he took pictures with,

16:24.113 --> 16:26.811
probably to send back
to his family in Venezuela.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.726
He let them know that
he was doing good,

16:28.726 --> 16:32.730
he got a good job, working for
a good company, good people.

16:34.384 --> 16:35.820
We have the photos.
You want to see them?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.039
No, I remember the guy.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.215
Oh, so now you remember him?

16:39.215 --> 16:40.477
Well, I don't pour concrete.

16:40.477 --> 16:41.870
You know, I'm the foreman.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.179
You're terrible
at this, Randall.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.616
- What? This?
- Lying.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.575
So do yourself a favor.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.708
Just come clean
with everything, please.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.319
Come on.

16:58.626 --> 17:02.586
Look, I didn't kill anybody,
I swear to God.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.501
They were already dead
when I found them.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.851
I hired two migrants
for day labor.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.462
They must have snuck back
onto the site when

17:08.462 --> 17:10.507
everyone left for the night.
I don't know.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.944
They were probably looking
for a place to sleep.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.730
How did they die?

17:15.730 --> 17:17.732
They took an elevator
that was only supposed to be

17:17.732 --> 17:23.129
for building material
and small equipment.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.218
It's 100-pound weight limit.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.610
It's 120 max.

17:26.610 --> 17:29.396
There's a sign
on the damn thing too.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.919
Maybe they couldn't
read English.

17:30.919 --> 17:34.140
You're saying this whole
thing was an accident?

17:34.140 --> 17:36.272
When I gotta the site,

17:36.272 --> 17:38.405
the elevator was smashed like
a--

17:38.405 --> 17:41.364
like a pancake,
and they were on the ground

17:41.364 --> 17:43.845
in the middle of the mess, dead.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.848
And you didn't think to call
the police or report that?

17:46.848 --> 17:48.545
You thought a better idea
would be,

17:48.545 --> 17:50.591
let's bury them in cement?

17:50.591 --> 17:53.463
No, no, of course, I wanted
to do the right thing,

17:53.463 --> 17:55.770
but there's been
a lot of accidents lately,

17:55.770 --> 17:57.772
and the city comptroller
said he was gonna shut us down

17:57.772 --> 17:59.426
if there was any more injuries.

17:59.426 --> 18:03.604
So I--I just called
Mr. Wise, my boss.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.214
Wait. Hold on, hold on.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.091
Eric Wise?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.527
Yeah.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.704
Do--do you know him?

18:16.704 --> 18:18.227
No.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.838
I just see his name on
buildings like everybody else.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.623
Well, if you knew him,
then you know how he'd feel

18:22.623 --> 18:25.321
about a $300 million project
being shut down.

18:26.714 --> 18:29.891
He told me to make
the problems go away.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.719
So you did.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.634
Yeah.

18:33.634 --> 18:36.419
I'm not proud of it,
but, you know.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.681
Yeah.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.509
So let's talk
about Luis Morales.

18:39.509 --> 18:41.337
How did he end up dead?
You shoot him?

18:41.337 --> 18:44.558
What? No.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.342
That wasn't me.

18:46.342 --> 18:50.999
I was at my house
with my family all night.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.348
Who killed him then?

18:52.348 --> 18:54.655
I--I--

18:54.655 --> 18:56.700
I told Mr. Wise
that this Morales kid

18:56.700 --> 18:58.006
was asking a lot of questions,

18:58.006 --> 19:00.661
that he might have seen
the dead bodies.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.838
And then what did
Mr. Wise say?

19:05.840 --> 19:09.322
He said that
he'd take care of it.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.208
Hey.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.949
ME said that both
bodies recovered

19:27.949 --> 19:30.473
at the construction site
were dead prior

19:30.473 --> 19:31.996
to being put in the concrete.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.216
And the cause of death
for both was

19:34.216 --> 19:36.218
this massive traumatic event--

19:36.218 --> 19:40.004
nearly every bone in their body
was either broken or fractured.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.485
We found
an incident report too.

19:42.485 --> 19:46.054
There was an elevator on site
that collapsed four days ago.

19:46.054 --> 19:47.447
No injuries reported.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.231
So Tully was
telling the truth,

19:49.231 --> 19:50.841
at least about those two.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.234
Doesn't mean he wasn't lying
about killing Morales.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.757
His alibi checks out.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.933
He was in Queens
at the time of the murder.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.605
<i>I called, and I told him
I was coming.</i>

20:15.605 --> 20:18.129
<i>Yes, Mr. Wise
is expecting you.</i>

20:18.129 --> 20:20.262
<i>Follow me.</i>

20:20.262 --> 20:22.351
Hell of a view.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.874
<i>Sir.</i>

20:23.874 --> 20:25.746
You get to live up high
when your empire

20:25.746 --> 20:28.139
is built
on other people's backs.

20:31.621 --> 20:34.015
- Sorry to bother you.
- No. No problem at all.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.756
Have a seat.

20:35.756 --> 20:38.106
Hey, you thirsty?
Want something to drink?

20:38.106 --> 20:39.063
No.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.553
The police found
the two bodies.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.947
Yeah, I heard.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.384
But we're okay, though.
I--they--they questioned me.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.604
I said I didn't know anything,
and they--they bought it.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.301
So we're okay.

20:59.301 --> 21:02.565
<i>And my biggest project is--
is shut down indefinitely,</i>

21:02.565 --> 21:04.132
<i>maybe permanently
because now it's</i>

21:04.132 --> 21:08.223
an active crime scene,
so I don't know how okay I am.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.399
They also asked me about
that Morales kid's murder,

21:10.399 --> 21:13.184
and I said I didn't know
anything about that, either.

21:16.623 --> 21:19.016
<i>Because you don't, right?</i>

21:20.366 --> 21:23.543
Yeah. Sure.

21:23.543 --> 21:24.892
But my point is,
is that I don't think

21:24.892 --> 21:26.197
they have anything on you.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.808
But just in case, you--
you should make sure

21:27.808 --> 21:29.984
that you cover your tracks,
and I could help.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.160
<i>See, I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

21:32.160 --> 21:34.380
<i>I mean, if you're
somehow implying that</i>

21:34.380 --> 21:37.992
<i>I had something to do with
that day laborer's murder...</i>

21:37.992 --> 21:41.256
No, I--you--
you said that you were

21:41.256 --> 21:42.692
gonna take care of him.

21:44.738 --> 21:48.524
Yeah, I don't remember
that conversation.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.874
I hid the bodies
because you asked me to.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.922
So you know you can trust me.

21:57.185 --> 21:59.709
I'm sorry to hear
you say that, Randall.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.276
Wait, well, hold--
hold on, hold on.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.625
<i>You don't have
to play tough guy.</i>

22:02.625 --> 22:03.844
<i>What?
No one's playing tough guy,</i>

22:03.844 --> 22:05.324
<i>but you come into my home,</i>

22:05.324 --> 22:07.630
<i>you start making
ridiculous accusations.</i>

22:07.630 --> 22:08.979
He's in trouble.
We gotta go in there.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.198
Wait.

22:10.198 --> 22:11.547
<i>I just think it's best
if you leave.</i>

22:11.547 --> 22:13.201
Yeah, it's not a problem.

22:13.201 --> 22:16.160
And I also think it's best
you find a new job.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.423
What do you--

22:17.423 --> 22:18.859
<i>Someone's gotta
be held accountable</i>

22:18.859 --> 22:21.427
<i>for those two deaths.</i>

22:21.427 --> 22:22.819
<i>That someone is you.</i>

22:24.821 --> 22:26.301
<i>Show Randy out.</i>

22:31.175 --> 22:33.047
Can you zoom in
on the security guard?

22:33.047 --> 22:35.092
- Yeah.
- Small of his back.

22:36.529 --> 22:37.878
Oh, he's packing.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.401
That looks like a 9 mil.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.621
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.061
Psst. Hey, Ian. Hey.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.715
No, no, no, no! Police. Police.

22:48.715 --> 22:51.370
Do not do that.
Do not do that.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.763
We have a warrant for that
weapon you're reaching for.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.462
Do yourself a favor,
take your hand away,

22:56.462 --> 22:58.420
and put it above your head.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.771
Do it now, or my partner will
shoot you where you stand.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.078
Go ahead, sweetheart.
Give me a reason.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.122
Do it.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.735
Do it now!

23:08.735 --> 23:09.910
Above your head!

23:09.910 --> 23:11.302
Interlock your fingers.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.000
Turn around! Turn around!

23:17.526 --> 23:18.614
Ian Belsky,
you're under arrest.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.311
What for?

23:20.311 --> 23:22.357
Well, for starters,
possessing a firearm

23:22.357 --> 23:23.837
without a conceal permit.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.316
But once we've run
the ballistics,

23:25.316 --> 23:27.275
I'm sure we'll upgrade
that charge to murder.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.588
Ballistic tests confirm
that your gun was the one

23:35.588 --> 23:37.241
used to kill Mr. Morales.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.330
Police found traces
of Morales's blood

23:39.330 --> 23:42.159
on clothing recovered
from your apartment.

23:42.159 --> 23:45.511
And we can place your car
and your cell phone

23:45.511 --> 23:47.338
near the park at the time
of the murder.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.645
I assume you brought us here
for more than just

23:49.645 --> 23:51.125
a show and tell.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.909
When police searched
Mr. Belsky's apartment,

23:52.909 --> 23:57.087
they also found a duffel bag
filled with $100,000 in cash.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.484
If someone paid you
to kill Luis Morales,

24:02.484 --> 24:04.965
we might be able to work out
some sort of an arrangement.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.401
What kind of arrangement?

24:06.401 --> 24:09.317
Depending on what he says,
we'd be willing to offer

24:09.317 --> 24:12.538
man one, recommend 20 years.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.931
I want ten.

24:14.931 --> 24:19.022
You're looking at life.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.546
20 is a gift.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.722
They can't use anything
I say here against me, right?

24:22.722 --> 24:24.332
That's correct.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.855
If I keep my mouth shut
and eat the charge,

24:25.855 --> 24:27.814
Eric Wise is gonna
take care of my family.

24:27.814 --> 24:30.773
Only thing he can't offer me
is time, you can.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.820
And if you won't,
I'll take his money.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.300
Ten years or I don't testify.

24:44.308 --> 24:46.615
Without Belsky, we don't
have a case against Wise.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.530
Ten years for a
cold-blooded murder?

24:48.530 --> 24:50.053
I--I get it, but--

24:50.053 --> 24:50.967
But what?

24:50.967 --> 24:52.795
Wise ordered the murder.

24:52.795 --> 24:55.015
And he is a threat to society.

24:55.015 --> 24:58.322
He regularly uses
and abuses migrant workers

24:58.322 --> 24:59.976
to build his skyscrapers.

24:59.976 --> 25:02.718
There have been eight deaths
on Wise City construction sites

25:02.718 --> 25:04.677
over the past two years alone.

25:04.677 --> 25:07.767
Not counting the two
workers buried in cement?

25:07.767 --> 25:09.725
And those are just
the ones we know about.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.901
Who knows how many others
he's covered up.

25:13.686 --> 25:17.820
Unfortunately, the practice
of hiring unskilled workers

25:17.820 --> 25:22.433
is not uncommon nor even
illegal in many instances.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.131
Lots of companies do it.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.915
There was an article
in "The Times"

25:25.915 --> 25:27.874
a couple of months ago
detailing a number

25:27.874 --> 25:29.832
of accidental deaths

25:29.832 --> 25:32.922
on construction sites
all over the city.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.751
But unlike those developers,
Eric Wise escalated

25:35.751 --> 25:37.274
to straight-up murder.

25:37.274 --> 25:40.843
Yeah, which means we can
put him away for life.

25:42.323 --> 25:43.977
If we give Belsky
what he wants,

25:43.977 --> 25:45.979
we need to be sure
his testimony is enough

25:45.979 --> 25:48.590
to get a conviction
against Wise.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.419
I understand.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.160
Okay.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.204
Make the deal.

25:59.558 --> 26:04.301
Mr. Belsky, you admit
to murdering Luis Morales?

26:04.301 --> 26:05.912
Yes.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.435
I shot him three times.

26:07.435 --> 26:10.743
And did the defendant,
Eric Wise, pay you to kill him?

26:10.743 --> 26:11.874
Yes.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.267
He offered me 100 grand

26:13.267 --> 26:15.617
but said it had to be done
that day.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.314
He say why?

26:17.314 --> 26:18.489
Apparently,
the kid knew something

26:18.489 --> 26:20.187
he wasn't supposed to.

26:20.187 --> 26:22.798
Wise needed him silenced
before he talked.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.495
And after you killed
Mr. Morales,

26:24.495 --> 26:27.629
did the defendant pay you
the money he promised?

26:27.629 --> 26:28.935
Yeah.

26:28.935 --> 26:30.980
The next day,
I went to his apartment,

26:30.980 --> 26:33.113
where he gave me
the money in cash.

26:33.113 --> 26:36.290
Thank you. Nothing further.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.727
There's no proof
of this transaction

26:38.727 --> 26:40.816
you claim happened, is there?

26:40.816 --> 26:44.211
No bank statements,
wire transfer logs?

26:44.211 --> 26:46.822
Like I said,
he paid me in cash.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.955
Do you know Randall Tully,

26:48.955 --> 26:53.133
the foreman who Luis Morales
caught pouring concrete

26:53.133 --> 26:55.483
over the two
dead construction workers?

26:55.483 --> 26:57.137
Yeah, I know him.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.529
You two close?

26:58.529 --> 27:00.923
I only know him because
we both worked for Wise.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.012
But Randall Tully
doesn't work

27:03.012 --> 27:05.275
for Mr. Wise anymore, does he?

27:05.275 --> 27:08.365
No, my client fired him
once he learned

27:08.365 --> 27:10.672
of his horrific actions--

27:10.672 --> 27:12.674
attempting to cover up
the accident,

27:12.674 --> 27:14.545
which occurred under
his supervision.

27:14.545 --> 27:15.851
Objection. Relevance?

27:15.851 --> 27:17.723
Where is this going,
Mr. Rems?

27:17.723 --> 27:20.334
Your Honor, as foreman,
Randall Tully

27:20.334 --> 27:23.337
had exclusive access
to a slush fund

27:23.337 --> 27:26.470
to address any issues
that arose on the site.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.691
The defense is entering into
evidence financial records

27:29.691 --> 27:36.437
showing that $100,000
is missing from this account.

27:36.437 --> 27:39.483
Isn't it true, Mr. Belsky,

27:39.483 --> 27:41.877
that it was Randall Tully
who hired you

27:41.877 --> 27:45.707
to kill Luis Morales
to stop him from telling

27:45.707 --> 27:49.276
anyone what he saw Randall do?

27:49.276 --> 27:50.581
No.

27:50.581 --> 27:52.192
And isn't it true that
he's agreed to pay you

27:52.192 --> 27:55.064
even more money to point
the finger at my client,

27:55.064 --> 27:57.240
the man who fired him?

27:57.240 --> 27:58.328
No.

27:58.328 --> 28:01.288
Eric Wise is the one
who hired me.

28:01.288 --> 28:02.724
Mm-hmm.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.946
Mr. Belsky...

28:09.252 --> 28:12.038
You've admitted
to everyone here

28:12.038 --> 28:14.997
that you murdered someone
for money.

28:17.347 --> 28:20.437
Doesn't it stand to reason
that you'd just as easily

28:20.437 --> 28:22.918
lie for money too?

28:36.758 --> 28:39.718
Tully swears he didn't take
the money out of that account.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.981
But the bank statements
clearly show

28:41.981 --> 28:44.766
he was the authorized user
who withdrew the 100k.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.029
Is there video
of the transaction?

28:47.029 --> 28:48.552
It happened over
two months ago.

28:48.552 --> 28:52.469
The bank doesn't keep
video logs going back that far.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.775
Wise is smart.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.473
He must have figured out
some way to withdraw

28:56.473 --> 28:58.258
the money using Tully's card.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.564
Yeah, or he--or he paid
someone after the fact

29:00.564 --> 29:01.827
to doctor the records.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.567
Either way,
they've given the jury

29:03.567 --> 29:07.310
a credible narrative that
Randall Tully, not Eric Wise,

29:07.310 --> 29:08.703
was behind the murder.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.661
We can call Tully
to the stand,

29:10.661 --> 29:12.098
have him refute the claim.

29:12.098 --> 29:14.317
No, given that the defense
has painted him

29:14.317 --> 29:18.060
as a bitter ex-employee with
an axe to grind against Wise,

29:18.060 --> 29:20.497
and the fact the jury's
already heard about him

29:20.497 --> 29:22.804
burying two dead bodies
under the concrete,

29:22.804 --> 29:26.155
I don't think they'll find him
any more credible than Belsky.

29:26.155 --> 29:28.679
We're gonna have to
find something else.

29:28.679 --> 29:29.985
Hmm.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.770
Is that a good "hmm"?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.293
Maybe.

29:33.293 --> 29:36.992
In Cosgrove's arrest report,
he mentions that

29:36.992 --> 29:39.168
Eric Wise's housekeeper
showed the detective

29:39.168 --> 29:42.824
into Wise's office
to make the arrest.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.913
She was also present
when Tully tried

29:44.913 --> 29:46.828
to implicate Wise on the wire.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.003
What's your point?

29:48.003 --> 29:49.788
Wise doesn't think
of the people

29:49.788 --> 29:51.354
who work for him
as human beings.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.966
Hell, he doesn't even
think of them at all.

29:53.966 --> 29:57.839
Which makes it easy to
forget that they are people

29:57.839 --> 29:59.798
with thoughts and feelings--

29:59.798 --> 30:02.017
And ears.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.812
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.379
I'm with the district
attorney's office.

30:16.379 --> 30:17.903
Well, what do you want?

30:17.903 --> 30:19.556
I just want to ask you
a few questions

30:19.556 --> 30:21.863
about your boss, Eric Wise.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.430
I have nothing to say.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.831
We're from Beirut.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.963
Oh, that's where
my parents are from.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.836
They moved here years ago,
before I was born.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.577
And now you're a lawyer here?

30:40.577 --> 30:42.841
Uh-huh.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.409
Samantha Maroun.

30:48.368 --> 30:49.456
Soraya Hamoud.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.373
And I'm Injila.

30:53.373 --> 30:54.940
I like your bag.

30:57.116 --> 30:58.900
Injila, go upstairs.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.293
I'll be there soon, okay?

31:04.906 --> 31:07.778
How long have you two
been in the U.S.?

31:07.778 --> 31:10.129
Almost two years.

31:10.129 --> 31:11.739
I wanted a better life.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.219
I understand.

31:16.309 --> 31:19.834
You know your boss, Eric Wise,
is on trial, right?

31:21.227 --> 31:23.055
Yes.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.274
I need to know if you
ever heard him talking

31:25.274 --> 31:28.974
to his bodyguard, Ian Belsky.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.333
It's okay.

31:45.425 --> 31:49.603
Mr. Wise likes to act
like I don't exist.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.043
The day after Morales
was murdered,

31:55.043 --> 31:58.090
Soraya heard Wise tell
Ian Belsky he did a good job

31:58.090 --> 32:00.353
taking care of the problem.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.833
He also told him not to deposit
the 100k he gave him

32:02.833 --> 32:04.748
to avoid a paper trail.

32:04.748 --> 32:06.228
Sounds good to me.

32:06.228 --> 32:09.492
But Soraya and her daughter
are here illegally.

32:09.492 --> 32:12.974
She had friends who applied
for H-1 visas and were denied,

32:12.974 --> 32:15.846
and she was scared
it would happen to her too.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.500
So how did she get here?

32:17.500 --> 32:19.807
She got a tourist visa,
claimed they were visiting

32:19.807 --> 32:23.550
a cousin and gave a fake
address on the application,

32:23.550 --> 32:26.988
and has been evading
ICE ever since.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.164
She can still testify.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.514
We don't report
undocumented witnesses

32:31.514 --> 32:32.863
to federal authorities.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.561
I told her that,
but she's scared.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.736
Of course.

32:35.736 --> 32:36.998
But we don't have a choice.

32:36.998 --> 32:39.087
We need her testimony.

32:39.087 --> 32:41.307
Oh, so we use her

32:41.307 --> 32:43.874
like Eric Wise used
undocumented workers

32:43.874 --> 32:46.355
to build his buildings?

32:46.355 --> 32:49.663
This could ruin her life
and her daughter's.

32:49.663 --> 32:52.927
She attempted
to circumvent the law.

32:52.927 --> 32:57.453
It's not up to us to shield her
from the consequences of that.

32:57.453 --> 33:02.197
We'll do everything we can to
protect her, you have my word.

33:02.197 --> 33:04.852
But we're calling her
to the stand.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.297
Your Honor, we're
having some difficulty

33:15.297 --> 33:16.516
locating our next witness,
Soraya Hamoud.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.692
The People request
a brief continuance

33:18.692 --> 33:20.259
while detectives
track her down.

33:20.259 --> 33:23.175
The prosecution is
obviously stalling here.

33:23.175 --> 33:27.048
If the state can't make
their case, that's on them.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.007
I'll give you 24 hours,
Mr. Price.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.139
But tomorrow morning,
the trial will resume

33:31.139 --> 33:33.054
with or without your witness.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.447
I'll see you all then.

33:34.447 --> 33:35.970
We're adjourned.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.624
Soraya could be anywhere.

33:37.624 --> 33:40.148
For all we know, she's halfway
to California by now.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.760
We found her.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.110
That's good news.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.721
Yeah, well,
I'm not so sure about that.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.070
She's in ICE custody.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.854
Her neighbors said that
they raided her apartment

33:50.854 --> 33:52.639
in the middle of the night.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.075
They took Soraya
and her daughter.

33:58.775 --> 34:01.561
Son of a bitch
tipped off the Feds.

34:03.954 --> 34:06.087
Where is Soraya
being detained?

34:09.177 --> 34:11.614
I'm sorry, the detainee
you're attempting to see

34:11.614 --> 34:12.963
isn't allowed visitors.

34:12.963 --> 34:14.269
If you'd called ahead,
we could have warned you.

34:14.269 --> 34:16.315
I'm not here
for a visitation.

34:16.315 --> 34:19.057
Soraya Hamoud is a witness
in a murder trial.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.754
We're requesting
that you release her

34:20.754 --> 34:23.713
and her daughter to state
custody so she can testify.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.150
Not that simple.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.978
There are allowances
for instances where

34:27.978 --> 34:30.111
a witness is necessary or--
- There are.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.026
But I can't just let her go.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.028
You need to file
the necessary paperwork.

34:34.028 --> 34:36.117
By the time I do that,
she'll be back in Lebanon.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.553
Sorry. Nothing I can do.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.338
You may want
to rethink that statement

34:39.338 --> 34:41.601
if you want me
to keep my mouth shut.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.870
Excuse me?

34:49.870 --> 34:51.741
I have a big mouth,
Mr. Garson.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.091
A really big mouth.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.528
And I can get really loud, too,

34:55.528 --> 34:57.356
especially when I know about
a federal agency

34:57.356 --> 35:00.010
aiding and abetting a murderer.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.190
They took Injila
away from me.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.843
I--I don't know where she is.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.367
She's here.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.499
She's being held
with other children her age,

35:10.499 --> 35:12.153
but she is safe.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.894
I need to see her.

35:13.894 --> 35:14.895
I need my daughter.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.070
I will talk to them.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.160
We can't go back to Lebanon.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.553
We have nothing there.

35:20.553 --> 35:24.383
Her life--
- I've arranged a deal.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.559
If you agree to testify
against Wise,

35:26.559 --> 35:28.517
they'll keep you
and your daughter in custody,

35:28.517 --> 35:31.651
but they'll postpone
your removal hearings

35:31.651 --> 35:33.479
until after the trial is over.

35:34.784 --> 35:39.659
So you get what you need,
but what about us?

35:39.659 --> 35:42.183
Well, the delay
will buy us some time

35:42.183 --> 35:44.359
to figure out
how to keep you here.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.405
My boss is the
district attorney.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.407
He has some sway.

35:48.407 --> 35:51.714
And your assistance
in a high-profile case

35:51.714 --> 35:54.978
will help us argue
you should be allowed to stay.

35:56.893 --> 35:59.505
There's still hope.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.420
Trust me.

36:10.211 --> 36:13.258
Ms. Hamoud, could you
please tell the court

36:13.258 --> 36:15.173
about the conversation
you overheard

36:15.173 --> 36:17.566
between the defendant
and Ian Belsky

36:17.566 --> 36:20.830
on the afternoon of
Thursday, November 10?

36:20.830 --> 36:23.311
They were in his office.

36:23.311 --> 36:26.314
Mr. Wise had me bring whiskey.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.969
I remember thinking it
was early to be drinking,

36:28.969 --> 36:32.581
but they were
celebrating something.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.322
Mr. Wise made a toast.

36:34.322 --> 36:36.716
Do you know what it was
they were celebrating?

36:36.716 --> 36:38.152
I didn't at the time.

36:38.152 --> 36:42.200
But Mr. Wise
thanked Mr. Belsky,

36:42.200 --> 36:46.421
said he did a good job
taking care of his problem.

36:46.421 --> 36:50.643
Did you hear him
say anything else?

36:50.643 --> 36:52.862
He told him to be careful
with the money

36:52.862 --> 36:55.213
he had given him.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.607
He said that
if Mr. Belsky deposited

36:58.607 --> 37:04.309
$100,000 in his bank account,
it would be suspicious.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.268
He told him not to spend it

37:07.268 --> 37:09.270
on something
extravagant, either.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.794
Did you notice
anything unusual

37:11.794 --> 37:14.841
when Mr. Belsky left
the apartment that afternoon?

37:14.841 --> 37:16.321
Yes.

37:16.321 --> 37:20.760
He left with a piece
of luggage, a small bag.

37:20.760 --> 37:24.198
There is a word for it. Uh.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.113
- Duffel bag?
- Yes, that's it.

37:26.113 --> 37:29.159
He did not have it
when he arrived.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.859
Thank you.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.077
Nothing further, Your Honor.

37:42.869 --> 37:47.526
You're asking us
to believe that my client

37:47.526 --> 37:52.748
said all of these incredibly
incriminating things

37:52.748 --> 37:55.403
right in front of you?

37:55.403 --> 38:01.366
Mr. Wise never really thought
about where I was or wasn't.

38:01.366 --> 38:04.891
Most of the time,
he forgot I was even there.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.167
Ms. Hamoud,

38:20.167 --> 38:23.518
are you a legal resident
of the United States?

38:25.215 --> 38:27.827
No, I am not.

38:27.827 --> 38:31.483
So you're here illegally?

38:31.483 --> 38:33.093
Yes.

38:33.093 --> 38:37.750
In fact, you're currently in
federal custody, aren't you?

38:37.750 --> 38:39.447
Yes.

38:39.447 --> 38:43.582
Ms. Hamoud, did the
district attorney's office

38:43.582 --> 38:47.368
offer you a deal to stay
in this country in exchange

38:47.368 --> 38:51.241
for testifying
against my client?

38:51.241 --> 38:53.200
They said they would help.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.854
No further questions,
Your Honor.

38:54.854 --> 38:59.119
But I would have testified
even if they didn't.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.903
Your Honor.

39:02.557 --> 39:06.126
I left where I'm from

39:06.126 --> 39:10.348
because powerful people abused

39:10.348 --> 39:14.090
and oppressed people like me.

39:14.090 --> 39:19.748
I came here because I believed
this country was better,

39:19.748 --> 39:23.839
that there was more opportunity
here for people like me.

39:26.494 --> 39:29.105
And I still believe that.

39:50.344 --> 39:54.000
Will the defendant
please rise?

39:54.000 --> 39:58.004
Madam Foreperson, has the
jury reached the verdict?

39:58.004 --> 40:00.485
We have, Your Honor.

40:00.485 --> 40:03.313
In the charge of murder
in the first degree,

40:03.313 --> 40:06.273
we find the defendant,
Eric Wise...

40:06.273 --> 40:07.840
guilty.

40:21.984 --> 40:23.421
Okay, thank you so much.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.292
Ms. Maroun.

40:25.292 --> 40:26.728
Good news.

40:26.728 --> 40:29.035
I just found an amazing
immigration lawyer.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.906
It's too late.

40:30.906 --> 40:32.212
What do you mean?

40:32.212 --> 40:34.562
Soraya's hearing
was yesterday.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.129
What?

40:36.129 --> 40:38.871
They said they would wait
until after the trial was over.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.394
They lied.

40:40.394 --> 40:41.743
Well, that's disgusting.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.223
It sure is.

40:43.223 --> 40:46.879
Well, then--then we
file a petition,

40:46.879 --> 40:49.925
figure out how
to reverse the decision.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.710
They're gone.

40:51.710 --> 40:54.713
Soraya and her daughter
are back in Lebanon.

41:03.983 --> 41:05.637
Excuse me.
