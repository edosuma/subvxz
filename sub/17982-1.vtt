00:40.480 --> 00:42.240
Good morning, London!

00:42.320 --> 00:43.960
It's a beautiful, sunny day.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.880
Looking at the thermometer,
a very lovely 18 degrees.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.400
We've got a classic tune coming up.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.680
So, crack a couple of eggs
and put the toast on.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.761
Carly?

03:16.680 --> 03:18.330
Hey, sleepyhead.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.085
You awake?

03:22.080 --> 03:23.809
Morning, Dad.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.321
Good morning, sweetie.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.771
Want some breakfast?

03:28.120 --> 03:30.280
Yeah?

03:30.360 --> 03:31.805
Okay, see you downstairs.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.045
What are you drawing, sweetie?

04:01.960 --> 04:05.362
That's me, that's you, and that is Mommy.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.880
That's beautiful.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.800
Tell you what, why don't I put
this over there with the others

04:10.880 --> 04:12.520
and you finish your breakfast? Deal?

04:12.600 --> 04:13.681
Deal.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.364
All right, hurry up. We're gonna be late.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.000
All right, you have a good day at school.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.160
Okay, angel?

05:31.240 --> 05:33.040
- I will.
- Make sure you work hard.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.160
- I always do, Daddy.
- Yeah.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.520
- You know why?
- Why?

05:36.600 --> 05:37.601
'Cause you got your mother's brains.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.049
Okay, see you.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.926
All right, sweetheart.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.606
Good night.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.400
Good night, Daddy.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.760
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.449
She's growing up real fast.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.530
Miss you.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.562
Hey!

08:08.840 --> 08:10.360
...head up the stairs.
Check in the bedrooms.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.647
Check in the kid's bedroom.
I don't care. All right?

08:12.760 --> 08:14.364
Just go. Fuck off!

08:15.400 --> 08:16.686
Jesus Christ.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.040
Daddy! Daddy!

08:22.120 --> 08:23.600
- Shut up!
- No!

08:23.680 --> 08:24.681
Carly.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.003
- Stay down.
- Daddy!

08:28.520 --> 08:30.090
Shut up!

08:33.799 --> 08:34.801
Try anything, huh?

08:35.520 --> 08:36.851
And bang.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.039
- It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
- On your knees.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.610
- It's gonna be okay.
- Now!

08:46.800 --> 08:47.801
Hands behind your head.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.880
Take it easy.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.689
Shut your mouth.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.200
Look, whatever you guys want,
just take it and leave.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.000
- Don't hurt my daughter.
- Shut the fuck up.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.321
- She's just a kid...
- I said, shut the fuck up!

08:58.520 --> 09:00.204
There's nothing.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.326
Where is it?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.000
Where is what?

09:04.080 --> 09:05.280
Don't mess with me.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.521
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.120
- The coke! Where is the cocaine?
- What?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.960
What cocaine? What are you talking about?

09:11.040 --> 09:12.724
I don't know anything about any drugs.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.965
I am not fucking playing around, man.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.810
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.880
- What are you doing?
- She is not going to want to see this.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.240
No! No!

09:21.320 --> 09:22.360
Hey!

09:22.440 --> 09:23.805
Now listen.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.040
I will put a bullet in your kid's head

09:28.120 --> 09:29.770
- if you don't tell me where it is.
- Sorry.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.644
Please, don't do that.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.160
Look, just listen to me, all right?
You got the wrong house.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.561
No, man, I got the right place.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.603
23 Kingsbury Grove.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.360
No.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.522
This is 23 Kingsbury Green.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.560
This is 23 Kingsbury Green, not Grove.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.320
Look, on the table behind you,
there's a utility bill.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.006
It says 23 Kingsbury Green on it.
Look at it.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.004
The utility bill! Look at it!

10:14.040 --> 10:15.246
I told you, man.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.364
23 Kingsbury Green.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.725
Please, just don't hurt my daughter.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.441
All right? Just leave.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.000
I won't say anything to anyone...

10:26.080 --> 10:27.520
You're not going to go to the police?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.800
No, I'm not going to go to the cops, man.

10:29.880 --> 10:30.960
Are we supposed to believe that?

10:31.040 --> 10:34.440
If you go right now,
I will not say anything. Just go.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.760
You've seen my face.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.881
Don't do this, please. Don't...

10:45.840 --> 10:47.080
Daddy!

10:48.400 --> 10:49.600
I'm sorry, man.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.045
Daddy!

11:01.080 --> 11:02.650
You let her go.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.080
Daddy!

11:06.160 --> 11:07.605
Let her go, man.

11:09.640 --> 11:10.920
Fucking let her go!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.040
I'll cut her throat!

11:12.120 --> 11:13.281
Daddy!

11:14.440 --> 11:15.440
- I got you.
- Daddy?

11:15.520 --> 11:16.880
- Daddy, don't go!
- I got you.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.883
It's okay. It's all over.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.400
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.925
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.127
I gotta make a phone call, sweetie. Okay?

11:29.920 --> 11:32.287
Daddy. You're bleeding.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.805
Callister speaking.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.081
Hello?

11:40.320 --> 11:41.481
Daddy!

11:42.120 --> 11:44.043
Daddy, wake up!

11:44.160 --> 11:45.241
Daddy!

11:54.400 --> 11:55.925
Oh, God. Yeah.

11:56.760 --> 11:57.841
Yeah.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.400
This better be important.

12:05.480 --> 12:06.560
Ray.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.644
We have a situation in London.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.405
Tom's in trouble.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.161
What?

13:00.800 --> 13:01.881
Hey!

13:03.960 --> 13:05.041
Hey!

13:07.640 --> 13:09.165
What the hell is going on?

13:11.480 --> 13:13.130
Where is my daughter?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.360
You took several blows to the head.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.204
Been out for almost 10 hours.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.527
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Where's my daughter?

13:28.320 --> 13:30.800
She's fine, Mr. Parker.
She's in good health.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.840
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Quinn.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.320
I need to see her. Where is she?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.402
Kavendish Place, at Social Services.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.560
Get me out of these cuffs.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.160
Yeah, I'm afraid I can't do that.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.240
Why?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.004
'Cause you're under arrest for murder.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.240
And I can't find any
record of your existence.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.891
What the hell are you talking about?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.160
Those guys broke into my house, all right?

13:51.240 --> 13:52.840
They were trying to
kill me and my daughter.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.520
Mr. Parker, you don't
have to say anything more.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.251
Just know, if you do,
it might harm your defense.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.640
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.000
Do you understand me?

14:02.080 --> 14:04.162
It was self-defense, all right?

14:04.280 --> 14:05.680
I didn't have a choice.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.603
Well, we'll see about that.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.645
Hey, Carly.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.327
Hi.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.202
It's nice to meet you.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.970
My name's Stacey.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.962
What's that you're drawing?

14:57.160 --> 14:59.003
I love your bracelet.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.723
You know, I've got a necklace
that I always like to wear.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.761
It was a gift from my mother.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.770
This was my mother's.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.800
My dad bought it for her before she died.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.891
It's okay, sweetie.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.844
You're safe now.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.128
Bad men came into my house.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.369
They hurt my dad.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.328
He was just protecting me.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.405
It's his job.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.725
He guards things.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.800
I know.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.245
Where is he?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.881
He's in the hospital, sweetie.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.801
They're making sure he gets better.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.722
And then can I see him?

16:03.360 --> 16:06.760
...found in the oceans and seas
around the world. Humpback...

16:06.840 --> 16:08.080
You didn't tell him you were pregnant?

16:08.160 --> 16:09.400
No, I mean...

16:09.480 --> 16:13.200
A neighborhood is in shock after
homeowner and father Martin Parker

16:13.280 --> 16:17.088
took the law into his own hands and
reportedly shot and killed three intruders.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.880
In this burglary gone wrong,

16:18.960 --> 16:22.080
police are being unusually tight-lipped
about the prime suspect.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.810
Emergency services
were quick to the scene,

16:23.920 --> 16:26.240
but unfortunately not quick enough.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.926
- The three young men were found dead.
- Oh, shit.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.523
Gentlemen, I hear we have a problem.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.330
Damn right we do.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.765
That's unfortunate.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.283
These guns you sold me
are a piece of shit.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.359
You have a nice way with words.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.442
The guns are Chinese knockoffs.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.923
I was promised quality.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.604
That's why I came to you.

17:13.720 --> 17:19.000
I can assure you these guns
are of the highest quality.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.127
I ain't buying any guns.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.489
I'm getting my money
and taking my business elsewhere.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.880
Let's see.

17:31.960 --> 17:35.400
Royal Bulldog, 9mm.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.720
Yeah, I know what it is.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.760
It don't work for shit!

17:38.840 --> 17:40.410
Short recoil.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.080
Accurate up to 50 meters.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.321
Where's my money?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.161
Where...

17:53.840 --> 17:55.444
Works fine for me.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.686
Mr. Cooper?

18:03.640 --> 18:07.361
I just got sent a UK news story
from one of our sources.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.762
You gotta take a look at this.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.640
A neighborhood is in shock after
homeowner and father Martin Parker

18:14.720 --> 18:19.086
took the law into his own hands and
reportedly shot and killed three intruders.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.480
In this burglary gone wrong,

18:20.560 --> 18:24.160
police are being unusually tight-lipped
about the prime suspect.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.571
Where is he?

19:03.040 --> 19:05.646
How much did you pay for that rock?

19:05.880 --> 19:08.200
All right, fellas.
Boss says this is a private party.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.320
Drinks are on the house.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.440
Thank you very much.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.000
One for the lady.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.280
To the boys!

19:13.360 --> 19:14.486
Cheers.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.126
Yeah, that's it.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.480
Oh, that is... There we go.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.160
He's got her. He's got her...

19:21.240 --> 19:22.920
Let me just hook that up for you.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.001
You're bad.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.605
Give me some tips.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.680
You've been schooled.
You've been schooled. Here we go.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.840
All right, my turn, my turn.

19:30.920 --> 19:31.960
Thanks very much, boys!

19:32.040 --> 19:33.000
You're very welcome.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.120
Come on. I'm going for a smoke.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.160
See you in a minute, gentlemen.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.163
Smoking will be the death of you, mate.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.611
Bad for you.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.930
She was so into you.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.640
You're making money today.

19:58.520 --> 19:59.880
Here you go.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.450
Better all be there.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.929
Go for champagne. Off you go.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.522
Fucking machine.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.240
You all right, sweetheart?

20:28.320 --> 20:29.720
Not so fast.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.325
Get 'em in. Get...

20:31.840 --> 20:33.410
All right.

20:33.840 --> 20:34.921
You ready, boys?

20:35.800 --> 20:36.801
Hey, sweetheart.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.681
Hello?

22:08.840 --> 22:10.205
Mr. Bishop?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.445
This is Charles Cooper.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.320
Personal call.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.480
This must be important.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.520
Extremely.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.601
I'm listening.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.085
Martin Parker.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.602
His real name is Thomas.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.164
Thomas McKenzie.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.444
He's an ex-federal agent.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.960
- Time frame?
- Tight.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.804
Then it's double my usual rate.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.161
Deal.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.330
One more thing.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.610
He has a daughter.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.051
It's for you. It's your lawyer.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.324
- Hello?
- It's Ray.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.164
Oh, Jesus Christ, Ray.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.240
My face is all over the news,
and I'm cuffed to a fucking bed.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.163
- You need to get me out of here now.
- I will.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.640
But you're being held for murder.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.160
Yeah, I didn't have a choice.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.402
Listen, I'm on a flight,
two hours out of Heathrow.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.848
When I land, I can
explain to the authorities

23:19.960 --> 23:22.400
the confidentiality
of your relocation in person.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.320
Two hours? That's not good enough.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.731
What about Carly?

23:25.840 --> 23:28.002
I'm doing my best. Take my number.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.841
Nurse, I need to write this down.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.440
All right, done it.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.000
- And, Ray?
- Yeah?

23:49.080 --> 23:50.411
Where's Cooper?

23:51.920 --> 23:53.360
We don't know.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.444
- I need to get to Carly.
- Listen...

24:05.200 --> 24:06.361
Sorry.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.962
Sierra-Delta-7-5, officer down in Room 4.
Prisoner has escaped.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.520
Hey!

25:45.600 --> 25:46.681
Don't move!

25:47.120 --> 25:49.122
Get down on the floor
and put your hands behind your back!

25:49.720 --> 25:51.131
Hold it!

25:54.320 --> 25:55.481
I said, get down!

25:56.200 --> 25:57.611
That's not gonna happen.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.447
Stacey?

26:55.360 --> 26:56.361
I'll be two seconds.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.649
We're moving the girl
to a secure location.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.208
- Why?
- There's been an incident with the father.

27:07.640 --> 27:08.960
He's dangerous.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.485
He's put three of my men in the hospital.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.769
I can go... You don't have to.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.201
No, no, I'll go.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.686
You're sure?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.680
The poor girl has no one.

27:18.760 --> 27:21.960
The last thing she needs is someone else she
doesn't know taking her to a strange location.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.728
- Okay, we need to go now.
- Okay.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.360
Carly, we need to go on some travels.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.805
Can you get your stuff?

27:42.280 --> 27:43.441
Can I help you, sir?

27:44.080 --> 27:46.200
Yeah, I'm Detective Chief Inspector Quinn.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.281
Right. Let me see that again, mate.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.480
You've got a girl here.
Blonde hair. Eight years old.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.720
Where is she?

27:57.800 --> 28:00.080
- I can't breathe.
- Answer the question.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.480
Upstairs with Stacey, I think.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.000
Which floor?

28:04.080 --> 28:05.286
Third.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.529
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

28:45.920 --> 28:47.400
Yeah, Detective Quinn.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.200
Looking for a girl
who was brought here earlier.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.406
Carly Parker.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.560
Oh, I'm not sure.

28:52.640 --> 28:56.208
You can try Graham's office, around the
corner, straight ahead, and on your right.

29:36.960 --> 29:37.961
Are you Graham?

29:42.640 --> 29:43.687
How can I help?

29:44.520 --> 29:45.646
Hey, I'm Detective Quinn.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.203
I'm looking for information
on a girl who was brought here.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.610
I'm gonna need to see some ID, Detective.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.763
Yeah, sure. Uh...

29:56.920 --> 29:57.967
Tough day?

29:58.800 --> 29:59.801
Excuse me?

30:02.680 --> 30:03.800
Oh.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.042
Yeah. Nothing I couldn't handle.

30:24.760 --> 30:25.921
You know what, I, uh...

30:27.360 --> 30:28.840
I think I left it in the car.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.001
That's a shame.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.441
Hey!

30:44.040 --> 30:45.485
- Run!
- Get off me!

31:10.120 --> 31:11.645
Thomas?

31:12.440 --> 31:16.680
You don't know who I am,
but you know what I am.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.491
And I know all about your past mistakes.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.720
Now, Mr. Cooper is paying handsomely

31:23.800 --> 31:26.326
for me to bring you
back to him in a coffin.

31:27.720 --> 31:31.645
He blames you implicitly
for what happened.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.324
Hey! Taxi!

33:00.240 --> 33:01.800
What the hell? I nearly killed you...

33:01.880 --> 33:03.280
- Drive now!
- What?

33:03.360 --> 33:04.771
- Move!
- All right, all right.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.120
Hey, you in a hurry, then?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.960
Something like that.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.240
Is there any particular place
you want me to drive you to?

33:26.320 --> 33:27.560
Just head south.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.090
You American?

33:31.720 --> 33:32.881
Which part?

33:33.280 --> 33:34.930
Different places.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.805
Are you... You on holiday?

33:37.520 --> 33:38.680
What?

33:38.760 --> 33:41.001
I said, are you on vacation?

33:41.120 --> 33:43.200
I know a lot of good restaurants.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.360
Do you like Italian?

33:44.440 --> 33:47.120
My mate has this beautiful place.
It's right on the river.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.761
They have spaghetti, pasta carbonara...

33:55.960 --> 33:57.200
It's bad news, Ray.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.567
- Where are you?
- I've just landed.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.200
On the way to get my rental.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.040
Tom has escaped police custody.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.200
What?

34:04.280 --> 34:06.000
They have no idea where he is.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.366
And Carly?

34:07.480 --> 34:09.199
She's been moved to a secure location.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.360
Where?

34:10.440 --> 34:13.170
They won't reveal.
Tom is still a wanted murderer.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.639
This is bullshit.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.848
We need to locate them, or Cooper will.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.280
I'll keep pushing through
the diplomatic red tape.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.880
Just find Tom.

34:20.960 --> 34:24.362
His last known location was Kavendish
Place, Social Services building.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.565
Gotcha.

34:39.679 --> 34:43.400
One call from me, and you are
booked on the best table there.

34:45.560 --> 34:46.719
Hello?

34:46.800 --> 34:48.005
This is the police.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.969
Now I need you to remain calm.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.679
Don't react to what I'm about to tell you.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.161
Don't draw any attention to yourself.

34:55.280 --> 34:58.090
Your fare is incredibly dangerous.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.410
Now laugh.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.200
What?

35:03.280 --> 35:05.647
Just laugh as if I said something funny.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.640
Yeah.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.321
Yeah.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.480
Yeah. Yeah.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.881
Good. Now where are you?

35:20.720 --> 35:23.371
Yeah, I'm on the A112, mate.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.880
Have you gone past the petrol station yet?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.000
No.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.321
Pull in there, and I'll be
with you in 90 seconds.

35:33.880 --> 35:34.881
All right.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.763
That was, uh... That was the wife.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.804
She gets worried.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.080
I, um...

35:46.160 --> 35:48.520
Yeah, I need... I need some petrol.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.728
There's a station up ahead.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.971
Everything okay?

35:57.200 --> 35:59.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah... No, yeah.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.003
It's all fine. It's all good.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.120
All good.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.611
Yeah, I'll, uh...

36:35.360 --> 36:37.044
I'll be really quick.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.731
Shit.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.805
Where are you?

38:14.720 --> 38:15.767
Fuck!

38:19.000 --> 38:20.206
Gotcha.

38:56.720 --> 38:57.767
Oi!

39:00.600 --> 39:02.967
Ten grand if you knock him out for me!

39:25.800 --> 39:27.370
It's good money.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.371
Come on, let's do it.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.524
Hey, you got a phone I could use?

39:36.320 --> 39:37.446
Your phone. Give me your phone.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.324
Oi, mate, we got a fucking phone for you.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.241
He said 10K.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.964
That's not a good idea, boys.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.080
Hello?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.207
It's me.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.960
Where the hell are you?

40:57.040 --> 40:59.486
Cooper sent someone after me.
I'm trying to shake him.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.726
Where are you now?

41:02.280 --> 41:04.169
- You got GPS?
- Yeah.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.080
Okay, Royal Victoria Docks,
cable car terminal.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.844
Meet me there in four minutes.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.120
Seven minutes to destination.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.571
Whoa, four minutes?

41:13.960 --> 41:15.803
I'm counting on you, buddy.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.041
Thanks.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.080
God damn it.

41:58.520 --> 41:59.567
Come on, Ray.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.840
Come on, move!

42:02.920 --> 42:04.160
Four minutes to destination.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.571
Move!

42:49.680 --> 42:50.806
Get in!

43:00.640 --> 43:02.449
Motherfucker.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.166
Oh, shit.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.370
Jesus, Tommy, you're hit.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.206
God. I'll be okay.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.526
Who the hell was that?

43:17.520 --> 43:18.720
Present from Cooper.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.280
Oh, shit.

43:20.360 --> 43:21.521
Where's Carly?

43:22.960 --> 43:24.849
They got her in protective custody.

43:25.240 --> 43:26.924
Apparently, I'm dangerous.

43:27.040 --> 43:28.087
Here's the address.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.247
- I'll check upstairs.
- Right.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.520
Where are we?

43:52.600 --> 43:55.444
We're just staying at this farmhouse,
just for tonight.

43:58.880 --> 44:00.240
I'm scared.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.446
What?

44:02.200 --> 44:03.200
I'm scared.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.327
No.

44:04.800 --> 44:05.926
Hey.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.680
You haven't got to be scared.

44:08.760 --> 44:12.200
I'm here, and I'm not going
to let anything happen to you.

44:12.280 --> 44:13.520
Okay?

44:14.280 --> 44:15.920
I miss Dad.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.650
Everything's going to be all right.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.565
Why don't we get you up to bed?

44:23.680 --> 44:25.440
You must be tired
after the long day you've had.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.602
Doesn't that sound like a good idea?

44:28.600 --> 44:29.886
Yeah. Go on.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.605
Move upstairs.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.560
We've got Carly's location.

44:38.640 --> 44:39.801
Where is it?

44:40.840 --> 44:44.003
Old Oak Farm, TN8, 2JR.

44:45.280 --> 44:46.280
Got it.

44:46.360 --> 44:49.360
Tom, we're going to
get you out of this mess.

44:49.440 --> 44:52.440
I'll have your arrest warrant rescinded
within the next 20 minutes,

44:52.520 --> 44:55.000
an embassy detail dispatched
to Carly's location.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.285
Just get to the safe house
while we arrange extraction.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.171
That looks bad, Tom.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.725
In or out?

45:07.320 --> 45:08.481
Out.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.884
I'm gonna get you
to a safe house in London.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.968
- No. We're not going...
- Then I'm gonna get you patched up.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.920
Then I'll take you to Carly's...

45:15.000 --> 45:16.120
We need to go and get her now, Ray.

45:16.200 --> 45:17.680
You're no use to her
if you bleed to death.

45:17.760 --> 45:18.800
Fuck!

45:18.880 --> 45:21.042
Now, I've got men who are on their way.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.240
You and your daughter's safety
is my only priority.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.322
Why the fuck do you think I'm here?

45:26.880 --> 45:30.120
I'm gonna get you fixed up, and you
and your daughter can be long gone

45:30.200 --> 45:33.010
before Cooper and his present
even know about it.

45:35.920 --> 45:37.126
Understood?

45:38.360 --> 45:39.441
Yeah.

45:49.440 --> 45:50.680
Yep?

45:51.960 --> 45:53.280
Oh, come in, Sarge. What you got for me?

45:53.360 --> 45:55.200
Oh, good news, sir.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.601
Your work load has just got lighter.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.127
What?

46:00.680 --> 46:02.205
They shut the Parker case.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.365
What the hell are you talking about?

46:06.400 --> 46:08.004
You're off the case.

46:13.880 --> 46:16.640
I've got three officers in the hospital
on account of this bastard.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.640
And I've got three bodies on ice!

46:19.720 --> 46:20.880
This is my case!

46:20.960 --> 46:22.000
Not anymore.

46:22.080 --> 46:24.560
This has come straight from the top.

46:24.640 --> 46:27.041
- Diplomatic intervention.
- Nah.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.800
No, this is fucking bullshit!

46:28.880 --> 46:30.530
Call it what you like, sir.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.246
It's done.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.201
Fuck!

46:59.360 --> 47:00.361
Mr. Cooper?

47:00.720 --> 47:02.688
I must say, I'm disappointed.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.360
He'll be dead before sunup.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.000
There's nothing to worry about.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.360
And the girl?

47:08.440 --> 47:11.800
She was taken to a safe location
before I could get to her.

47:11.880 --> 47:12.927
Where?

47:14.040 --> 47:15.280
I said, where?

47:15.920 --> 47:17.410
I'll know shortly.

47:17.520 --> 47:18.567
You better.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.284
I'm landing in 30 minutes.

47:56.640 --> 47:57.801
I can walk.

47:59.120 --> 48:01.566
Still the same old
stubborn son of a bitch.

48:40.240 --> 48:42.004
- Which floor?
- The fifth.

49:45.240 --> 49:46.320
Nice place.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.562
Yeah, well, the suite
at the Ritz was taken.

49:58.560 --> 49:59.680
Where are you?

49:59.760 --> 50:02.000
- I'm at the safe house with Tom.
- Good.

50:02.080 --> 50:03.920
I need an update on Carly.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.520
We're mobilizing agents
to her location as we speak.

50:06.600 --> 50:07.680
Good.

50:07.760 --> 50:09.360
But just make sure Tom is okay,

50:09.440 --> 50:12.480
and we'll have him reunited
with his daughter within the hour.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.166
What's the intel on
the guy that Cooper sent?

50:15.280 --> 50:18.443
We managed to pull an ID
from the Emirate line CCTV.

50:18.720 --> 50:19.880
Who is he?

50:19.960 --> 50:21.769
Goes by the name Bishop.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.040
His file reads like a one-man militia.

50:24.120 --> 50:27.360
Learned his craft at MI6,
though the Brits won't admit it.

50:27.440 --> 50:30.762
And for the last 10 years,
the black market has been his home.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.929
He's the most dangerous assassin
Europe has to offer.

50:36.640 --> 50:38.440
Comforting to know.

50:38.520 --> 50:39.646
We'll be in touch.

50:47.200 --> 50:48.770
Let's get you cleaned up.

50:50.720 --> 50:53.440
The subject's name is Carly Parker,

50:53.520 --> 50:56.524
and is located at Old Oak Farm, TN8, 2JR.

50:56.640 --> 50:59.644
She must be brought back
safely to the embassy.

51:00.680 --> 51:01.841
Any new intel on Cooper?

51:02.840 --> 51:06.000
All we know is that he
slipped out of the country

51:06.080 --> 51:07.440
when we moved you and Carly here.

51:07.520 --> 51:09.400
I mean, he hasn't stopped working.

51:09.480 --> 51:14.008
He's still supplying the Serbs,
the Croats, North Koreans with guns.

51:14.840 --> 51:16.080
Anyone with money.

51:16.160 --> 51:18.640
We just can't find the son of a bitch.

51:18.760 --> 51:21.120
You getting so close,
it really spooked him.

51:21.200 --> 51:24.200
A guy like Cooper wants
to stay hidden, he stays hidden.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.963
Yeah, well...

51:30.200 --> 51:31.326
...he can't hide forever.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.564
I admire your optimism.

51:40.880 --> 51:41.881
This might pinch a little.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.202
No, wait!

52:23.000 --> 52:24.525
Westminster.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.484
There you are, Thomas.

52:45.360 --> 52:46.646
How you feeling?

52:47.040 --> 52:48.087
I'll live.

52:50.080 --> 52:52.480
I'll feel a lot better once Carly's back,

52:52.560 --> 52:54.324
when this whole mess is over.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.840
It will be.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.288
Oh, and you can guarantee that?

53:10.160 --> 53:11.730
It's not your fault.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.044
Yeah, well, I don't see it that way.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.884
You can't think like that.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.564
She's dead because of me, Ray.

53:26.680 --> 53:29.809
No, it was Cooper who did that, not you.

53:30.440 --> 53:33.046
That car bomb was meant for me.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.324
I'm the one that should be dead, not her.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.764
You know, when I met Emma,

53:46.160 --> 53:48.800
I was so deep into that world that

53:48.880 --> 53:51.565
I didn't even recognize myself anymore.

53:52.800 --> 53:57.124
But she was the one thing that
reminded me of who I actually am.

53:59.920 --> 54:03.280
Now Carly's the only thing
that reminds me of who she was.

54:03.360 --> 54:05.044
If I can't protect her,

54:06.440 --> 54:07.487
then what?

55:12.760 --> 55:14.080
You good?

55:14.160 --> 55:15.525
Let's move.

56:13.640 --> 56:14.641
Key!

56:20.120 --> 56:21.645
Son of a bitch!

56:36.400 --> 56:37.400
Ray, weapons?

56:37.480 --> 56:38.481
Bedroom.

56:52.600 --> 56:53.761
Clever.

56:54.920 --> 56:56.600
- You ready?
- What's the alternative?

56:56.680 --> 56:57.681
That wasn't the question.

57:12.400 --> 57:13.845
Hello, Thomas.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.204
Aren't you going to invite me in?

57:17.640 --> 57:19.449
I know all about you.

57:21.040 --> 57:25.204
Fed who got in too deep
and ended up with a dead wife.

57:26.280 --> 57:27.440
Fuck you!

57:28.680 --> 57:32.366
Now, now, Thomas,
there's no need for unpleasantries.

57:33.360 --> 57:39.049
You know, after I kill you,
guess who I'll be tracking down next?

57:39.560 --> 57:40.971
I'll give you a clue.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.045
Blonde hair,

57:44.120 --> 57:48.409
sweet brown eyes,
a smile just like her mother's.

57:51.200 --> 57:54.283
You see, my employer, Mr. Cooper,

57:54.880 --> 57:57.520
he wants to get to know his granddaughter.

57:57.600 --> 57:58.761
Carly, is it?

58:00.520 --> 58:04.411
He feels it will go some way to replacing
the daughter you took from him.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.801
You're gonna be dead before
you get anywhere near her.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.885
Well, he'll be landing soon.

58:13.600 --> 58:16.251
So, you can either open up
this door and die quickly,

58:17.080 --> 58:19.367
or you can drag this
out and die painfully.

58:20.400 --> 58:21.765
What's it going to be?

58:22.080 --> 58:24.526
Like I said, fuck you!

58:37.320 --> 58:39.049
What do you want?

59:05.200 --> 59:06.406
Tom?

59:06.520 --> 59:08.966
I'm good, I'm good.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.001
Come on.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.960
- Shh! Come on!
- No, go!

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.246
- I'll cover you.
- No.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.047
Come on.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.000
Oh, my God!

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.081
Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.320
Keep moving, come on!

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.480
Move!

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.410
How you doing, buddy?

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.760
Hanging in there?

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.410
Come on, talk to me, Ray.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.050
I got nothing to say.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.762
Oh, there's a first time
for everything then, isn't there?

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.283
Go and get your daughter, Tom.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.040
I'm gonna get you to a hospital first.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.121
No.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.160
There's no point.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.000
You're acting like this is the
first time you've been shot.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080
Hey!

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.288
Hey, look at me, Ray. Ray!

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.609
Just keep the... Just keep
the pressure on the wound, Ray.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.604
Ray!

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.485
God damn... Stay with me, Ray.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.685
I'm sorry, man.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.841
Sh...

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.360
- Hello?
- Stacey Miller?

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.720
Yup.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.290
My name is Gail Callister.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.600
I don't want to alarm you,
but I need you to listen very carefully.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.280
I'm working with the US Embassy
and the British Police Force

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.725
and I've taken over the case.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.800
What?

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.960
You can confirm with your superiors,
but I'm sending protective detail

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.440
to your location right now
to take care of you and Carly.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.560
If Carly's father's coming here,
if he's dangerous, then I need to know.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.320
Carly's father is a good man.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.084
That's not why we're moving you.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.570
Hand over the gun, slowly.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.731
Now drive.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.040
Sorry about your dead friend.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.690
Shut the fuck up.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.880
You're not going to kill me.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.120
I am.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.282
If you were, you'd have done it by now.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.770
Only reason you're not dead is because
you're going to do something for me.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.566
What was it like?

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.247
Undercover for five years,
being someone else?

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.207
Must have been quite the thrill
trying to take a man like Cooper down.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.171
Did you enjoy it?

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.286
Or you enjoyed fucking Cooper's daughter?

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.441
Kill the engine.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.931
Give me the keys.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.880
Get out.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.081
Now.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.881
Hands behind your head, fingers locked.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.890
Very scenic.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.086
Move.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.605
She's very beautiful.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.770
And so precious.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.444
You'll be with her very soon.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.445
You know, it's like

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.124
one of the universe's greatest jokes.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.967
All the money, all the power,

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.922
and I'm chasing something I can't have.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.283
Emma was the most important thing
in the world to me.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.200
When I get my granddaughter,

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.810
I will make sure her father
is nothing but a distant memory.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.004
I'm gonna call your employer.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.288
You're going to tell him,
"Mission accomplished." I'm dead.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.760
Then you're going to tell him
you have his granddaughter,

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.322
and you're going to arrange
to meet him right here.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:25.170
One entrance, elevated positions.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.529
Cooper's a sitting duck.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.680
If I do what you're asking,
what's in it for me?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.964
Maybe I'll let you live.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.411
You think you got what it takes
to kill a man like Cooper?

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.800
'Cause I don't.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.359
I don't give a shit what you think.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.720
Just an observation.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:52.439
Your friend tonight? Dead.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.602
Your wife? Dead.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.571
You don't want to kill me,
not until I've made that call.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.408
If I make the call, that is.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.729
Well, maybe you should do it.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.768
I'm sure Carly would love
to hear your voice one last time.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.840
What are you talking about?

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.084
I'm talking about Carly
and her grandfather's family reunion,

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.522
which I'm guessing
is going on right about now.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.040
Bullshit.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.600
You don't know where she is.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.806
Impressive.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.960
You know, Detective Quinn was quite
talkative until I put a bullet in him.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.160
Old Oak Farm.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.561
That's where little Carly is, isn't it?

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.640
You guys from the embassy?

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.040
Yes. We'll take it from here.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.451
Thank you.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.841
Okay.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.200
Agents Boyd and Reid.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.930
Hi. I'm Stacey.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.240
The girl, is she asleep?

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.685
- Yeah.
- I'll get her.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.163
Wait, no, I can go.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.722
She's been through
enough the past few nights.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.400
She's scared and alone.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.847
We need to be out of here in 15 minutes.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.126
Okay.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.930
We have a problem.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.126
Oh, fuck.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.120
Dude!

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.804
Fucking bastard.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.760
Carly?

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.046
Wake up.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.169
I say we need to get going.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.366
How long?

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.564
Five minutes, Charles.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.280
We ready?

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.249
Yeah.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.960
I forgot my bracelet.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.809
You haven't got any kids, have you?

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.450
We'll bring the car over.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.240
Carly?

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.368
- Hurry up.
- Coming!

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.691
I believe you've been looking
after my granddaughter.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.327
Your services are no longer required.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.170
I can't find it!

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.525
Wait here.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.121
I'll finish this up, Mr. Cooper.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.649
I'm coming, baby.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.885
I got it!

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.890
Don't be afraid.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.800
My name is Charles.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.882
I'm your mother's father.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.209
Your grandfather.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.401
Here.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.526
Look.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.651
You're my grandfather?

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.320
Yeah.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.811
Do you know my daddy?

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.043
I know him very well.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.724
He's a good friend.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.887
He sent me to look after you.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.131
You know,

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.206
you look so much like your mother.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.922
My daddy says that, too.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.929
You got kind eyes, just like her.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.286
You know,

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.890
she was the most important thing
to me in the world.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.649
She was very special.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.850
Just like you.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.000
I believe she's looking
down on us right now.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.286
And you know what?

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.520
What?

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.001
I think she would be so happy

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.122
that we finally got to meet.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:20.488
Hey, uh, what do you say
we get out of here, hmm?

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.690
Why don't we go somewhere hot,

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.360
where it's sunny all the time?

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.851
Like a vacation?

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:31.966
Yeah.

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.686
Can Daddy come?

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.691
Of course.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.960
Come on.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.920
Carly, this is Hannah.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.480
She's very nice.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.080
She wants to be your friend.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160
Hello, Carly.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.527
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.451
Hey! Get him!

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.046
What was that?

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.481
Oh, uh...

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.200
Fireworks.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:13.200
You know, they make me nervous.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.124
Let's go to the living room
until they stop, huh?

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.364
He's gone into the barn!

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.561
You're a worthy adversary,
I'll give you that.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.086
Don't worry, Thomas.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.005
When you're dead, Carly will be
with her grandfather where she belongs.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.447
It's been fun.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.531
But this fight is over.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.481
Fuck.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.360
Looks like all those fireworks
have stopped, huh?

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.566
Yeah.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.650
You like jokes, do you?

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.681
Let's go, Charles.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.125
We're gonna be out of
this old place in no time.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.641
Daddy!

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.651
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.441
I'm here.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.842
What happened to your face?

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.280
Nothing, sweetie.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.441
I'm fine.

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.490
Why have you got a gun?

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.764
It's just pretend, angel.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.129
We were just getting to know each other.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.083
Reminds me so much of Emma.

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.446
Don't you think?

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.961
Granddad and I are going on vacation.
You can come, too.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.244
He's not your grandfather, sweetheart.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.326
- But he said...
- I don't care what he said.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.610
Let her go, Cooper.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.485
Drop the gun.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.320
I want to go to my daddy.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.640
Shut up.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.320
Drop it.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.642
I'm not going to ask again.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.286
Do as he says!

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.242
I've waited a long time for this.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.601
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.401
You...

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.082
I treated you like a son.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.600
You took everything from me.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:54.760
I gave you my daughter
and you betrayed me.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.763
It's finished, Charles.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.007
No.

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.204
Not yet, it's not.

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.882
Please don't hurt my dad.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.960
You okay?

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.522
I'm okay, sweetie. Are you okay?

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.201
Yeah?

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.127
Come here.

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.961
I love you.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.641
It's all right.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.531
You're safe now.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.361
Okay?
