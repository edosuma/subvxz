<i>Nyet.</i>

01:46.776 --> 01:48.642
That was like...

01:48.711 --> 01:51.579
watching a scene
from <i>Tower of Babel.</i>

01:51.647 --> 01:54.381
I was, um, pregnant
during my Russian course.

01:54.450 --> 01:56.417
Naomi came early.

01:56.485 --> 01:58.430
Naturally, that's the only
language that the desk clerk

01:58.454 --> 02:00.688
at the Baku Star
Inn speaks.

02:00.756 --> 02:03.057
Planning a vacation to Azerbaijan?

02:03.125 --> 02:04.391
I'm, uh...

02:04.460 --> 02:06.861
trying to track down my friend.

02:06.929 --> 02:08.395
Liam.

02:09.764 --> 02:12.600
Colleague who dropped in
on you last week?

02:12.668 --> 02:15.402
Yeah. Uh, we, uh...

02:15.471 --> 02:16.770
we had a disagreement.

02:16.839 --> 02:18.672
He disappeared.

02:18.741 --> 02:22.209
His credit card was charged at
that hotel two days ago, but...

02:22.278 --> 02:24.345
he's nowhere to be found.

02:24.413 --> 02:26.747
Must be some disagreement
if you're running traces

02:26.816 --> 02:29.583
on a CIA agent's
credit card.

02:29.652 --> 02:31.952
Connects to an NCIS case.

02:32.021 --> 02:33.387
Liam has new Intel

02:33.456 --> 02:36.190
on an operation we ran
to take down Victor Zelko.

02:36.259 --> 02:38.392
Arms dealer who went
after your family?

02:39.829 --> 02:41.962
Yeah. Raid wasn't
as clean as we thought.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.364
Not according to Liam.

02:43.432 --> 02:45.065
He's following up on it.

02:45.134 --> 02:47.635
And you're worried?

02:47.703 --> 02:49.637
He's in
an emotional state.

02:49.705 --> 02:51.071
He's drinking again.

02:51.140 --> 02:53.540
He's on some crusade
to expose the truth.

02:53.609 --> 02:54.875
What <i>is</i> the truth?

02:57.046 --> 02:59.213
Okay.

02:59.282 --> 03:01.115
Can you tell me...

03:01.183 --> 03:04.084
<i>why</i> Liam would be
in Azerbaijan?

03:04.153 --> 03:06.320
That's where Zelko was raised.
Maybe he's looking...

03:06.389 --> 03:07.721
for his relatives.

03:07.790 --> 03:08.989
But more likely...

03:09.058 --> 03:10.257
It's a smokescreen.

03:10.326 --> 03:12.993
And Liam isn't anywhere
near Eastern Europe.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.795
He is a spy.

03:14.864 --> 03:16.597
Yeah.

03:16.666 --> 03:18.599
Anything I can do?

03:18.668 --> 03:20.601
If I could just...

03:20.670 --> 03:22.336
find him...

03:22.405 --> 03:23.904
But he doesn't
want to be found.

03:25.207 --> 03:27.141
Would that stop <i>you?</i>

03:28.210 --> 03:30.110
Probably not.

03:30.179 --> 03:32.246
I'll pull some strings,

03:32.315 --> 03:33.847
do some digging.

03:33.916 --> 03:37.284
Maybe we can figure out
where he is together.

03:41.490 --> 03:43.857
Team's got a case.

03:43.893 --> 03:45.659
I should go.

03:49.532 --> 03:51.165
Thank you, Dwayne.

03:51.233 --> 03:52.366
Yeah.

04:00.543 --> 04:02.710
Ensign Milo Blevins.
C.O. reported him U.A.

04:02.778 --> 04:05.813
three days ago when he didn't
show up at his post at Stennis.

04:05.881 --> 04:07.848
Well, it doesn't quite
rise to the level

04:07.917 --> 04:09.883
of a <i>criminal</i> investigation.

04:09.952 --> 04:11.852
What am I missing?

04:11.921 --> 04:13.921
St. Tammany Parish Sheriffs
found his abandoned car

04:13.956 --> 04:16.357
at a rest stop parking lot;
no sign of Blevins.

04:16.425 --> 04:18.158
He have any reason
to be in St. Tammany?

04:18.226 --> 04:19.560
Well, according
to his C.O.,

04:19.628 --> 04:21.373
our missing ensign here
was actually searching

04:21.397 --> 04:22.629
for his missing brother,

04:22.698 --> 04:24.331
Henry Blevins.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.200
- Henry also Navy?
- No, ma'am.

04:26.268 --> 04:27.901
He's a drifter.
Makes his ends meet

04:27.970 --> 04:29.570
as a part-time
construction worker.

04:29.638 --> 04:30.749
- Arrest history?
- Drunk and disorderly.

04:30.773 --> 04:32.840
Some misdemeanor drug charges.

04:32.908 --> 04:34.875
In New Orleans
we call that "Tuesday."

04:34.944 --> 04:36.677
Well, again,
I'm not really seeing

04:36.779 --> 04:38.412
why we've been
called into this.

04:38.481 --> 04:40.225
'Cause Henry's not the only
local construction worker

04:40.249 --> 04:41.915
who fell off
the face of the earth.

04:41.984 --> 04:43.917
Two others disappeared
in the New Orleans area

04:43.986 --> 04:46.920
just last month, all working
for the same company.

04:46.989 --> 04:48.655
Something called Jax Inc.

04:48.724 --> 04:51.358
They operate a worksite just
outside of New Orleans, but...

04:51.427 --> 04:53.271
There's no information
about what they make

04:53.295 --> 04:55.262
- or build or do.
- Yeah, we can't even

04:55.331 --> 04:57.731
get them on the phone-- it just
goes straight to voice mail.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.067
Christopher, let Pride know
what's going on.

05:00.136 --> 05:01.568
Maybe he can help
dig in on this...

05:01.637 --> 05:03.404
Jax Inc. place.

05:03.472 --> 05:04.938
Gregorio,
Sebastian,

05:05.007 --> 05:06.940
let's pay them a visit.

05:13.616 --> 05:15.682
Someone was here
before us. Look.

05:15.751 --> 05:18.285
They used wire cutters
to make a hole in the fence.

05:18.354 --> 05:19.787
There's no guards at the gate.

05:19.855 --> 05:21.455
There's no one here, period.

05:22.925 --> 05:24.625
Let's take a look.

05:33.135 --> 05:35.636
That looks like
dormitories?

05:35.704 --> 05:37.682
- Could house, like, a hundred people.
- Yeah.

05:37.706 --> 05:39.473
I'll go check inside.
Okay.

05:41.110 --> 05:43.077
Hello? Anyone here?

05:43.145 --> 05:44.812
Kind of spooky.

05:47.116 --> 05:48.248
Hello?

05:49.351 --> 05:50.984
This is private property.

05:51.053 --> 05:52.719
You need to leave. Now.

05:52.788 --> 05:55.289
Slow your roll.
We're federal agents.

05:55.357 --> 05:56.668
We're gonna reach
for our credentials,

05:56.692 --> 05:57.539
and you're not
gonna shoot us, okay?

05:57.540 --> 05:59.196
You can do whatever you want
once you're off the grounds.

05:59.197 --> 06:02.062
Federal agents
means law enforcement.

06:03.365 --> 06:05.065
Do you have a warrant?
We can get one

06:05.134 --> 06:07.568
within the hour, but you
need to lower your weapons.

06:07.636 --> 06:09.970
Go get your warrant, then.

06:10.039 --> 06:12.451
You know, the way you're holding
those shotguns, if they go off,

06:12.475 --> 06:14.635
you're gonna pop your shoulder
right out of the socket.

06:15.644 --> 06:17.578
Just saying.

06:18.681 --> 06:19.681
No.

06:20.850 --> 06:22.616
Yeah, no.

06:22.685 --> 06:23.750
No, just forget it.

06:23.819 --> 06:24.830
You're embarrassing yourselves.

06:24.854 --> 06:26.153
Lower your weapons.

06:29.058 --> 06:31.792
Okay, now, you want
to tell us why you were

06:31.861 --> 06:33.093
about to blow our heads off?

06:33.162 --> 06:34.461
Trying to protect the property.

06:35.831 --> 06:37.931
From what?
None of your business.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.077
Does it have something
to do with

06:39.101 --> 06:40.312
the three missing
construction workers

06:40.336 --> 06:42.002
and one missing
naval officer?

06:42.071 --> 06:43.170
What naval officer?

06:43.239 --> 06:44.371
Shut up, Kyle.
Jax never...

06:44.440 --> 06:45.372
- Enough!
- Okay.

06:45.441 --> 06:46.773
Now we're getting somewhere.

06:46.842 --> 06:47.975
Who's Jax?

06:49.245 --> 06:52.212
Araminta Jax, our boss.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.593
She made it clear that we're
not supposed to talk to anyone

06:54.617 --> 06:55.883
or let anyone
onto the worksite.

06:55.951 --> 06:57.618
Why all the cloak-and-dagger?

06:57.686 --> 06:59.219
We're not saying any more.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.021
Okay. Kyle?

07:02.124 --> 07:03.690
Spill.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.860
Okay,

07:06.929 --> 07:09.663
Gregorio,
get a rush on that warrant.

07:09.732 --> 07:11.265
You two are gonna tell us

07:11.333 --> 07:13.834
where we can find Araminta Jax.

07:13.903 --> 07:15.836
<i>I really don't have time</i>

07:15.905 --> 07:17.638
to discuss this, Norman.

07:17.706 --> 07:18.759
I'm trying
to help you here.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.975
By offering me a fraction of what
my company is worth?

07:22.411 --> 07:23.677
No, thank you.

07:23.746 --> 07:25.379
Circumstances being
what they are,

07:25.447 --> 07:27.080
I'd say it's more than generous.

07:27.149 --> 07:29.082
But I don't want to sell.

07:29.151 --> 07:31.685
I know what my product is worth.
It's worth nothing

07:31.754 --> 07:33.554
if you go bankrupt.

07:34.723 --> 07:37.090
Araminta, be realistic.
All I want

07:37.159 --> 07:38.559
is to be left alone.

07:40.396 --> 07:42.663
You know I'm a friend, right?

07:42.731 --> 07:44.665
Yes, I know.

07:44.733 --> 07:47.668
And as a friend,
please hear me

07:47.736 --> 07:49.203
when I ask you to go.

07:49.271 --> 07:51.371
Excuse me.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.573
Ms. Jax?

07:52.641 --> 07:53.641
Yes.

07:53.676 --> 07:56.176
Special Agents
Pride and Lasalle, NCIS.

07:56.245 --> 07:59.046
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- What is this about?

07:59.114 --> 08:01.748
It's a sensitive matter.
We're here to speak to Ms. Jax.

08:01.817 --> 08:03.662
Well, I'm an investor in
Jax Inc. Anything you can...

08:03.686 --> 08:05.219
Norman, please.
I'll handle this.

08:06.488 --> 08:08.055
Of course.

08:08.123 --> 08:10.057
I'll call you later.

08:16.332 --> 08:17.464
Rough day?

08:17.533 --> 08:19.132
Rough year.
What do you need?

08:19.201 --> 08:20.979
To know about three
missing employees of yours.

08:21.003 --> 08:22.202
Considering
I've lost

08:22.271 --> 08:24.404
a hundred employees
in the last couple of months,

08:24.473 --> 08:26.373
you'll need to be
more specific.

08:26.442 --> 08:29.443
These three disappeared,
completely.

08:29.511 --> 08:32.412
And one of them had a brother.
The Navy officer

08:32.481 --> 08:34.414
who was investigating,
he's missing, too.

08:34.482 --> 08:36.616
I don't know what to tell you.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.453
I've lost
almost all my investors.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.587
I can't make payroll.

08:41.657 --> 08:43.823
My company
is imploding.

08:43.892 --> 08:45.068
The few of us who are left
are on edge.

08:45.069 --> 08:48.729
That explains the shotguns our fellow agents
faced at your worksite.

08:48.797 --> 08:50.230
Kyle and Gwen.

08:50.299 --> 08:52.232
They've been with Jax Inc.
from the start.

08:52.301 --> 08:54.701
They're extra... cautious.

08:54.737 --> 08:56.370
Cautious about what?

08:56.405 --> 08:58.805
Sabotaged equipment,
anonymous threats...

08:58.874 --> 09:01.074
You name it,
Jax Inc. has faced it.

09:01.143 --> 09:03.510
What exactly is
Jax Inc.?

09:04.880 --> 09:07.514
What do you know about seawalls?

09:08.717 --> 09:11.118
Since I was a child,

09:11.186 --> 09:13.120
I've been obsessed
with seawalls.

09:13.188 --> 09:15.188
The nature
of their construction.

09:15.257 --> 09:17.691
The weaknesses that
can lead to disaster.

09:18.994 --> 09:20.861
Pretty specific obsession.

09:20.929 --> 09:23.697
My family was caught
in the tsunami of 2004.

09:23.766 --> 09:26.366
I was the only one
who survived.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.868
I've dedicated
my life

09:27.936 --> 09:30.203
to figuring out how
to strengthen seawalls

09:30.272 --> 09:32.806
so they can withstand
any catastrophe.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.675
Trying to build a better levee?

09:34.743 --> 09:35.876
I don't need to.

09:35.944 --> 09:37.944
Because with my
chemical composition,

09:38.013 --> 09:39.946
I can fortify
existing levees

09:40.015 --> 09:42.549
to resist the worst Mother
Nature can throw at us.

09:43.619 --> 09:45.352
A cement-like polymer

09:45.421 --> 09:48.221
that expands and thickens
when wet, so when a storm hits,

09:48.290 --> 09:51.558
the polymer grows,
repelling all the elements.

09:51.627 --> 09:53.293
Something like that
could have prevented

09:53.362 --> 09:55.028
a lot of damage during Katrina.

09:55.097 --> 09:56.463
That's why I'm in New Orleans.

09:56.532 --> 09:57.798
I wanted to test it

09:57.866 --> 09:59.032
in a place
where the people

09:59.101 --> 10:00.367
would truly appreciate

10:00.436 --> 10:02.135
what this innovation means.

10:03.439 --> 10:05.508
This is very impressive,
Ms. Jax.

10:05.554 --> 10:08.008
Yeah, well,
it would have been...

10:08.077 --> 10:09.209
but I've faced resistance

10:09.278 --> 10:10.877
every step of the way.

10:10.946 --> 10:13.013
Well, case in point, I've
got two federal agents

10:13.082 --> 10:15.015
in my office questioning me.

10:15.084 --> 10:18.018
Just... due diligence
on a case, ma'am.

10:18.087 --> 10:20.253
I can't tell you what
happened to my employees

10:20.322 --> 10:22.089
or your naval officer.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.559
Chalk it up to my bad luck.

10:28.664 --> 10:30.731
Excuse me.

10:30.799 --> 10:31.932
Sebastian.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.667
We found the missing persons

10:33.736 --> 10:35.402
at the worksite.
It's not good.

10:35.471 --> 10:37.270
What do you mean?

10:38.640 --> 10:40.157
They're dead,
all four of 'em,

10:40.158 --> 10:41.524
including Ensign Blevins.

10:41.593 --> 10:43.116
Someone tried to bury 'em.

10:43.117 --> 10:43.766
What?

10:43.790 --> 10:45.029
Yeah, didn't do a good job
of it, either.

10:45.030 --> 10:47.931
Judge Collier didn't get back
to me about the warrant yet.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.132
How'd you find them?

10:49.201 --> 10:50.433
We didn't.

10:50.502 --> 10:52.335
NOPD did.

10:52.404 --> 10:54.137
Anonymous tip.

10:54.206 --> 10:57.707
They showed up with a warrant,
knew exactly where to look.

11:00.846 --> 11:02.345
All right.

11:02.414 --> 11:05.548
Keep me posted.

11:05.617 --> 11:08.151
They found four bodies
at your worksite.

11:08.220 --> 11:10.487
What? What are you
talking about?

11:10.555 --> 11:12.288
Ms. Jax,

11:12.357 --> 11:16.026
we're gonna have to ask you
to come back to NCIS with us.

11:16.094 --> 11:18.695
Araminta Jax?

11:18.764 --> 11:21.498
- Yes?
- New Orleans Police.

11:21.566 --> 11:23.967
You're a person of interest
in a murder investigation.

11:24.036 --> 11:25.036
You have to come with us.

11:37.149 --> 11:38.837
I don't understand
what's happening.

11:38.838 --> 11:41.049
What's happening is
that four bodies were found

11:41.050 --> 11:42.850
at your company's worksite.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.253
Three of them
employees of yours.

11:45.321 --> 11:46.687
And a Navy officer.

11:46.756 --> 11:49.023
And you think I'm responsible?

11:49.092 --> 11:51.492
NOPD got an anonymous tip
from a man

11:51.561 --> 11:53.594
that says
he helped you bury them.

11:53.663 --> 11:55.930
Well, that's just not true.

11:55.999 --> 11:57.710
Informant gave the police
the exact location

11:57.734 --> 11:59.333
of where the bodies were hidden.

11:59.402 --> 12:01.369
Why would I do something
like that?

12:01.437 --> 12:03.371
Well, according
to the complaint,

12:03.439 --> 12:04.939
your polymer is toxic.

12:05.008 --> 12:07.074
These men were
exposed and died.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.611
My product is groundwater safe
and completely harmless.

12:10.680 --> 12:14.081
Obviously,
I am being set up here.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.828
Or you're so obsessed
with your product that

12:15.852 --> 12:18.219
you're trying to hide the fact
that it's lethal.

12:18.288 --> 12:20.588
This is some kind of joke.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.424
We're taking this
very seriously, ma'am.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.694
And you should, too, 'cause
if those men were poisoned,

12:26.763 --> 12:29.030
you will be charged
with murder.

12:29.098 --> 12:31.032
We need access to your files--

12:31.100 --> 12:34.535
financials,
chemical analyses, everything.

12:34.604 --> 12:37.939
I think now is a good time
for me to ask for my lawyer.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.274
The only reason you're not
at central booking right now

12:40.343 --> 12:43.978
is because I convinced NOPD
to let you come with us.

12:44.047 --> 12:46.214
And why did you do that?

12:46.282 --> 12:48.950
Because I really want
to believe you.

12:50.787 --> 12:54.055
This case is wrapped in a bow.

12:54.123 --> 12:56.457
A lot of evidence
pointed at you.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.925
It's too convenient.

12:57.994 --> 13:01.429
On that,
we are in violent agreement.

13:01.497 --> 13:03.331
But if you want
to prove you're innocent,

13:03.399 --> 13:07.168
you have to be completely open
with us.

13:07.237 --> 13:09.904
We need your trust.

13:13.343 --> 13:15.109
How's it going in here?

13:15.178 --> 13:17.178
I've finished the autopsies.

13:17.247 --> 13:19.914
As suspected, Ensign Blevins

13:19.983 --> 13:22.116
died from blunt force trauma
to the head.

13:22.185 --> 13:23.651
That's the easy result.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.187
What about the three
Jax Inc. employees?

13:26.256 --> 13:28.689
They died from extremely high
levels of toxic poisoning.

13:28.758 --> 13:30.024
All right.

13:30.093 --> 13:32.159
So it's like
the anonymous tip said.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.829
You think
it was from the Jax polymer?

13:34.898 --> 13:37.131
It's impossible to say
until we analyze the poison

13:37.200 --> 13:40.301
in the blood and get a sample
of her product.

13:40.336 --> 13:43.971
However, the dead are speaking a
little more loudly than normal.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.317
Oh, man, I love it
when they do that.

13:45.341 --> 13:47.608
I found these strange marks

13:47.677 --> 13:49.543
on the employees' lower backs.

13:49.612 --> 13:52.013
Could be bugbites or a rash?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.215
Well, I think those
marks could possibly be

13:54.284 --> 13:56.117
the result of

13:56.185 --> 13:58.819
a low-gauge needle
discretely inserted.

13:58.888 --> 14:00.354
The irritant on the skin

14:00.423 --> 14:02.823
could be intentional
to hide the punctures.

14:02.892 --> 14:04.392
So you think
that they were injected

14:04.460 --> 14:06.127
with whatever toxin
killed them?

14:06.195 --> 14:08.029
Possibly. It would
be no small feat

14:08.097 --> 14:09.997
if it were done
via dialysis.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.399
Dialysis?

14:11.467 --> 14:14.168
Well, the level of
toxins in the body

14:14.237 --> 14:16.370
will take hours to transfuse.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.173
A cursory examiner might
conclude that they were

14:19.242 --> 14:22.310
poisoned over weeks
instead of a day.

14:22.378 --> 14:24.578
Okay, all right.
So that would mean what?

14:24.647 --> 14:27.748
That-that they were
strapped down somehow?

14:27.817 --> 14:29.183
Kind of indicates that

14:29.252 --> 14:30.729
there was more than one killer.
All to make

14:30.753 --> 14:32.219
Araminta Jax look responsible.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.688
I mean, it's just a theory.

14:33.756 --> 14:37.024
Yeah. Well,
I might have something.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.527
I was examining the victims'
bodies earlier,

14:39.595 --> 14:44.198
and I found two very partial
fingerprints, okay?

14:44.267 --> 14:46.200
Could be our suspect's.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.437
Those are barely
fingerprints, Sebastian.

14:49.505 --> 14:51.439
I know.
They're not much to go on.

14:51.507 --> 14:53.708
But I'm trying to reconstruct
them. You know, hopefully,

14:53.776 --> 14:55.487
- I'll get a better result.
- Let's get to it,

14:55.511 --> 14:58.012
because Dwayne believes
Araminta Jax is being set up.

14:58.081 --> 15:00.781
- - Let's try to prove him right.
All right.

15:00.850 --> 15:02.416
Hey, I like it
when I'm back here,

15:02.485 --> 15:04.251
and it's just the
two of us, you know?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.187
Been a while.
Yeah.

15:06.255 --> 15:08.689
All right,
let's catch a bad guy.

15:08.758 --> 15:11.125
- Okay.
<i>- Maybe we're thinking about this</i>

15:11.194 --> 15:12.626
all wrong.
I mean, maybe it's less

15:12.695 --> 15:14.528
about who profits
from her failure

15:14.597 --> 15:16.964
and more about who
loses to her success.

15:17.033 --> 15:19.633
Well, Araminta is trying
to build a better seawall.

15:19.702 --> 15:21.102
Actually, it's not.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.770
Because of climate change,

15:22.839 --> 15:26.073
levees and seawalls need
extensive rebuilding worldwide.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.576
That's a lot of business
for construction companies.

15:28.644 --> 15:30.322
But not if Jax Inc.'s
innovation is released.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.313
I mean, why build a new
seawall if you can just

15:32.382 --> 15:34.482
fortify an existing one
at a fraction of the cost?

15:34.550 --> 15:36.717
You think the construction
industry is conspiring

15:36.786 --> 15:38.486
against Araminta?

15:38.554 --> 15:40.821
I think they stand
to lose a lot from her success.

15:40.890 --> 15:43.057
I mean, what do we know
about economic hit men?

15:43.126 --> 15:44.792
Say what?

15:44.861 --> 15:46.927
In the 1950s,
the Iranian government

15:46.996 --> 15:50.498
denied U.S. oil companies
access to the country.

15:50.566 --> 15:52.800
So, the CIA backed a coup

15:52.869 --> 15:54.568
to oust the prime minister.
It worked.

15:54.637 --> 15:57.204
So they recruited operators
with savvy business sense

15:57.240 --> 15:58.806
and embedded them
in private companies

15:58.841 --> 16:00.741
outside the reach of
congressional oversight,

16:00.810 --> 16:02.410
and the economic
hit man was born.

16:02.478 --> 16:04.945
You saying like a shadow CIA?

16:05.014 --> 16:06.914
Historically, yeah,
but these days,

16:06.983 --> 16:08.849
economic hit men are global.

16:08.918 --> 16:11.352
If an industry feels
threatened by a disrupter...

16:11.421 --> 16:14.155
They hire someone
to maintain the status quo.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.657
- By destroying the competition.
- Yeah. They use

16:16.726 --> 16:18.270
financial pressure,
sabotage, blackmail,

16:18.294 --> 16:19.738
and if they're good,
they don't leave a trace.

16:19.762 --> 16:21.328
Well, whoever's
got their crosshairs

16:21.397 --> 16:23.864
on Jax Inc. is very good.

16:23.933 --> 16:25.966
So how do we find out
who this hit man is?

16:26.035 --> 16:28.502
We go to the source,
and we see if it sticks.

16:31.007 --> 16:34.542
Ms. Jax, this
is Patton Plame.

16:37.747 --> 16:41.182
That's the entire financial
history of Jax Inc.,

16:41.250 --> 16:42.850
and my personal
e-mail, too.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.618
Just the juicy bits.

16:44.687 --> 16:46.153
None of this is public.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.988
You hacked into
my computer?

16:48.057 --> 16:50.391
We needed information to build
a case. You weren't sharing.

16:50.460 --> 16:53.327
You can't use
this against me.

16:53.396 --> 16:56.030
We're not trying to build a case
against you, Ms. Jax.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.299
We're trying to prove
you're being targeted.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.401
But we need your help to do it.

17:01.537 --> 17:03.637
Go on.

17:03.706 --> 17:05.539
I put together a timeline

17:05.608 --> 17:06.906
of setbacks to your company.

17:06.976 --> 17:08.476
Loans called in early,

17:08.544 --> 17:11.212
faulty equipment,
investors that pulled out.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.980
There's a pattern here for sure.

17:13.049 --> 17:15.049
But we can't
figure out how any

17:15.117 --> 17:17.718
of your misfortunes connect.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.186
I can.

17:20.256 --> 17:22.189
The loans, the equipment,

17:22.258 --> 17:25.025
the investors--
they all came from one person.

17:26.095 --> 17:28.262
Norman Wong.

17:28.330 --> 17:30.431
- The man you were with this morning?
- Yeah.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.733
He was an early investor,
first member of the board.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.235
And supposedly a friend.

17:38.107 --> 17:39.440
<i>I'll be honest.</i>

17:39.509 --> 17:41.342
I've never had contact
with NCIS before,

17:41.410 --> 17:42.743
but now I've had

17:42.812 --> 17:44.245
the pleasure of meeting four

17:44.313 --> 17:47.014
of its intrepid special agents
in one day.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.494
Well, we just want to talk
to you about Jax Inc.

17:48.518 --> 17:50.584
Not sure I can
give you any insight.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.753
I don't know much about
its day-to-day operations.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.299
Well, you've recently
become an investor,

17:54.323 --> 17:55.756
now you sit on its board.

17:55.825 --> 17:59.527
You don't want
to discuss quarterly reports.

17:59.595 --> 18:00.528
You want to know about

18:00.596 --> 18:02.007
the four dead bodies
at the worksite.

18:02.031 --> 18:04.231
Oh, don't mind Ridwan.
He's my assistant.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.744
There's nothing I know
that he doesn't.

18:05.768 --> 18:08.435
Okay, so you were both
arguing with Ms. Jax

18:08.504 --> 18:10.271
before the police came for her.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.539
That's not how I'd portray it.

18:11.607 --> 18:13.407
How would you portray it?

18:13.476 --> 18:16.143
Araminta is a visionary,
but she's no businesswoman.

18:16.212 --> 18:19.780
I was attempting to save her
and her invention from herself.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.415
With a lowball offer?

18:21.484 --> 18:22.804
With a fair
and appropriate offer.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.618
Well, I mean,

18:24.687 --> 18:26.999
pennies on the dollar from the
last one you made her, right?

18:27.023 --> 18:28.267
I'm sorry.
What does this have to do

18:28.291 --> 18:29.468
with the murders
you're investigating?

18:29.492 --> 18:30.591
Three men died

18:30.660 --> 18:31.992
from toxic poisoning,

18:32.061 --> 18:34.228
possibly caused
by Jax's polymer.

18:34.297 --> 18:37.464
Which means her company is
ruined and much cheaper to buy.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.433
It also makes her
product worthless.

18:39.502 --> 18:41.735
I'll lose millions.
Not good business.

18:41.804 --> 18:43.170
Unless that was the intent.

18:43.239 --> 18:45.005
Araminta Jax has had
some really

18:45.074 --> 18:47.408
bad luck in the years
that you've known her.

18:47.476 --> 18:49.109
Yeah, you joining
actually coincides

18:49.178 --> 18:52.313
with her being on the brink
of bankruptcy and scandal.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.515
And if you're such
a good businessman,

18:54.584 --> 18:57.017
that really doesn't track,
does it?

18:57.086 --> 18:58.986
Sounds like an accusation.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.487
Do you have any evidence?

19:00.556 --> 19:02.122
Just your history.

19:02.191 --> 19:04.758
The companies you invest in
tend to implode.

19:04.827 --> 19:06.327
Yeah. Then you end up

19:06.395 --> 19:07.928
walking away with huge bonuses

19:07.997 --> 19:11.332
from the industries
who hired you to take them down.

19:11.400 --> 19:15.202
You want to know the
formula for my success?

19:15.271 --> 19:16.704
Research.

19:16.772 --> 19:18.339
I study every situation,

19:18.407 --> 19:19.873
every player involved.

19:19.942 --> 19:22.476
So when you showed up,
I did my homework.

19:22.545 --> 19:24.378
That's not creepy at all.

19:24.447 --> 19:27.281
Special Agent Khoury,
you've had a fascinating career.

19:27.350 --> 19:30.618
The years before you joined NCIS
could fill a book,

19:30.686 --> 19:34.355
but it's the operation in Yemen
that's most intriguing.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.457
Are you threatening me,
Mr. Wong?

19:36.525 --> 19:40.628
No. No. Threatening
a federal agent is a felony.

19:40.696 --> 19:43.397
I'm offering you
some valuable advice.

19:43.466 --> 19:44.965
And what is that?

19:45.034 --> 19:47.701
We all have secrets.

19:47.770 --> 19:51.572
I'll respect yours
if you respect mine.

19:51.641 --> 19:55.309
Now, if you'll excuse me.

20:02.218 --> 20:04.351
So, uh, what happened in there?

20:04.420 --> 20:07.354
Person of interest just became
suspect number one.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.101
I mean with you.
What-what happened in Yemen?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.557
How does that guy know about it?

20:10.626 --> 20:12.559
I don't know
how he knows.

20:14.330 --> 20:16.597
I don't really want to talk
about it, okay, Sebastian?

20:16.666 --> 20:18.332
Okay. Yeah, sure.

20:18.401 --> 20:20.367
You want to talk about these?

20:20.436 --> 20:21.769
Drinking glasses.

20:21.837 --> 20:24.038
Fingerprints, DNA.

20:24.106 --> 20:26.206
Wong's not the only one
who can do research.

20:26.275 --> 20:28.395
I'll do an overnight rush,
get the results by morning.

20:28.444 --> 20:29.610
Nicely done.

20:29.679 --> 20:31.612
I know.

20:57.773 --> 20:59.707
<i>So,</i>

20:59.775 --> 21:02.242
we have our man,
but no evidence.

21:02.311 --> 21:04.144
Well, Sebastian's been

21:04.213 --> 21:07.314
analyzing the fingerprints that
he found at Wong's hotel room.

21:07.383 --> 21:08.982
Maybe we can trace it back

21:09.051 --> 21:11.085
to the fingerprints he found
at the mass grave.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.754
Wong doesn't seem like the type
to do his own dirty work.

21:13.823 --> 21:16.056
Dwayne? I need
to speak to you.

21:18.828 --> 21:21.128
Keep digging.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.632
We got a problem.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.303
Or I do.

21:29.372 --> 21:32.639
Found these in my car
this morning.

21:35.378 --> 21:36.910
What am I looking at?

21:36.979 --> 21:40.280
Screen grabs from the raid
on Victor Zelko. Top secret.

21:40.349 --> 21:42.983
I haven't even seen them yet,
and I... I ran that operation.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.686
- You think they're from Wong?
- I'm sure of it.

21:47.990 --> 21:50.791
Well, the good news is
we're making him sweat,

21:50.860 --> 21:52.351
or he wouldn't be
pushing back so hard.

21:52.352 --> 21:56.497
Yeah, but Dwayne, look at the last photo.
That's Zelko and his family.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.435
Those are innocent victims.

22:01.504 --> 22:04.104
If this goes public...

22:04.173 --> 22:06.673
lot of people could get hurt.

22:22.027 --> 22:23.668
Did you know
about Zelko's family

22:23.669 --> 22:25.035
getting killed in the raid?

22:25.104 --> 22:26.403
Not until last week.

22:26.472 --> 22:28.305
Liam just found out.

22:28.374 --> 22:30.774
That's why he's in Azerbaijan?

22:30.843 --> 22:31.781
Yeah.

22:31.782 --> 22:35.078
Well, someone
in the operation knew.

22:35.147 --> 22:36.914
These photos are official.

22:36.982 --> 22:38.582
It was probably the NSA.

22:38.651 --> 22:39.883
They monitored the mission
with drones.

22:39.884 --> 22:43.320
What, then somehow Norman Wong
has access to the NSA?

22:43.389 --> 22:45.367
Yeah, and his message is clear.
If we continue to pursue him,

22:45.391 --> 22:46.631
he's gonna go public with this.

22:46.692 --> 22:48.492
Well, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.827
Well, what are we gonna do?
We can't just back off.

22:50.896 --> 22:54.464
He set Araminta Jax up
and killed four men to do it.

22:54.533 --> 22:55.966
I'm not backing off.

22:56.035 --> 22:56.626
But you're gonna...

22:56.650 --> 22:58.469
You want me to give in
to blackmail.

22:58.470 --> 23:00.003
I want you

23:00.072 --> 23:01.939
to think about your family.
I am, Dwayne.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.942
And every other person that's
part of that operation.

23:07.579 --> 23:10.447
This was so easy for Wong.

23:10.516 --> 23:13.350
It was like a reflex.

23:13.419 --> 23:15.085
This clearly isn't
the first time

23:15.154 --> 23:16.154
that he's done this.

23:17.222 --> 23:19.523
There's only way
to make him stop.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.093
Let's take him down
once and for all.

23:23.162 --> 23:24.628
Well, I can't just sit back

23:24.697 --> 23:26.296
while you take all the risk.

23:26.365 --> 23:28.131
This is my family
that's involved.

23:28.233 --> 23:30.334
I need to be a part of this,
Dwayne,

23:30.402 --> 23:32.002
whatever you're thinking.

23:32.071 --> 23:33.704
Hey. Guys,

23:33.772 --> 23:35.216
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I know you're having

23:35.240 --> 23:36.685
a whole heart-to-heart
thing. I didn't hear a word.

23:36.709 --> 23:38.586
But this-this can't wait.
What is it, Sebastian?

23:38.610 --> 23:39.888
I got a match
to the fingerprints

23:39.912 --> 23:41.111
from the mass grave.

23:43.182 --> 23:45.148
Wong's assistant, Ridwan.

23:45.217 --> 23:47.228
We found his fingerprints
on two of the dead bodies,

23:47.252 --> 23:48.685
including Ensign Blevins.

23:48.754 --> 23:50.454
He's not in any
American database,

23:50.522 --> 23:52.522
but he is in Interpol,
and he has quite a record.

23:52.591 --> 23:54.024
Yes, suspected multiple times

23:54.093 --> 23:56.526
for kidnapping,
extortion, murder.

23:56.595 --> 23:58.106
He's been working with Wong
for two years.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.563
Probably doing the same thing.

23:59.631 --> 24:01.865
So he's the one
who gets his hands dirty.

24:01.934 --> 24:03.511
We need to go to the hotel
and bring him in.

24:03.535 --> 24:04.801
Tammy and Lasalle already went.

24:04.870 --> 24:07.304
They checked out.
Probably getting out of Dodge.

24:07.373 --> 24:08.805
Well, I got a hack
on their phones.

24:08.874 --> 24:10.907
Wong's pretty much protected,
but Ridwan,

24:10.976 --> 24:12.976
pinging loud and clear.

24:14.079 --> 24:15.746
He's in an abandoned
parking garage

24:15.814 --> 24:16.980
in the Bywater.

24:17.049 --> 24:19.182
Well, let's have Lasalle
and Gregorio check it out.

24:19.251 --> 24:21.184
Good work, fellas.

24:22.788 --> 24:24.855
You know, I read up
on this Araminta Jax.

24:24.923 --> 24:28.759
She spent every penny she had
for this polymer thing of hers.

24:28.827 --> 24:30.527
Willing to go to jail
to protect it.

24:30.596 --> 24:32.162
You think she's for real?

24:32.231 --> 24:33.563
Yeah, I know she is.

24:33.632 --> 24:35.866
You go through a disaster
like she did,

24:35.934 --> 24:41.038
or like people around here
after Katrina, it changes you.

24:42.274 --> 24:43.418
She's trying to make
a difference.

24:43.442 --> 24:44.508
Yeah.

24:46.745 --> 24:48.278
Well, maybe we can help her.

24:48.347 --> 24:49.679
There's Ridwan.

24:49.748 --> 24:51.415
Yeah, who are
the other two jokers?

24:51.483 --> 24:53.617
Let's find out.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.460
Ridwan.

25:03.529 --> 25:05.362
NCIS. We want to talk.

25:05.431 --> 25:06.596
Stop!

25:20.679 --> 25:21.978
Get in.

25:25.551 --> 25:27.117
You're getting too close
to the edge.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.386
I know what I'm doing.

25:35.994 --> 25:36.994
Go, go, go.

25:40.399 --> 25:41.965
He's getting away.

25:43.802 --> 25:44.935
Nope.

25:57.316 --> 25:58.648
Stay down.

26:00.052 --> 26:02.152
Still got it.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.924
You're like Santa.

26:07.993 --> 26:09.693
Those bags you were carrying

26:09.761 --> 26:11.628
gave us an ironclad case.

26:11.697 --> 26:13.964
Dialysis equipment,
we assume, was used

26:14.032 --> 26:16.166
to poison three
Jax Inc. employees.

26:16.235 --> 26:18.335
And a mystery substance,
which I'm pretty sure

26:18.403 --> 26:21.671
is gonna be an exact match
for what killed them.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.673
And we found your fingerprint

26:23.742 --> 26:25.186
on a Navy officer
who was beaten to death.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.210
Bottom line,

26:26.278 --> 26:28.512
you're facing multiple
life sentences.

26:28.580 --> 26:32.215
Unless you cooperate with us.

26:32.284 --> 26:36.119
We want the names and locations
of your associates.

26:36.188 --> 26:38.655
And we want your boss,
Norman Wong.

26:41.326 --> 26:43.727
I'll cooperate.

26:43.795 --> 26:46.563
Okay?

26:46.632 --> 26:48.331
Tell you everything.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.800
But Norman Wong didn't
put me up to this.

26:52.204 --> 26:53.870
It was Araminta Jax.

26:53.939 --> 26:55.906
Oh, come off it.
She approached me months ago.

26:55.974 --> 26:59.509
Said she wanted me to help her
sabotage Jax Inc.

26:59.578 --> 27:02.312
She knew I had experience
in these types of projects.

27:02.381 --> 27:05.182
Why would she want to do
something like that?

27:05.250 --> 27:06.461
Because she realized
her innovation

27:06.485 --> 27:08.151
was never going to work.

27:08.220 --> 27:10.053
She wanted to be able
to walk away,

27:10.122 --> 27:11.855
collect insurance money.

27:11.924 --> 27:14.090
Wired me $100,000
to get it done.

27:14.159 --> 27:15.325
Check my e-mails.

27:15.394 --> 27:16.993
My bank account.
It all checks out.

27:17.062 --> 27:18.562
Yeah, because Wong
set it up that way,

27:18.630 --> 27:19.663
but we're not buying it.

27:19.731 --> 27:23.099
If you're afraid of him,
we can protect you.

27:23.168 --> 27:26.336
All you have to do is
come clean here.

27:26.405 --> 27:28.905
You can protect me
from Norman Wong?

27:28.974 --> 27:31.274
A man who has connections
in every government

27:31.343 --> 27:34.578
in the western hemisphere;
that's impressive.

27:34.646 --> 27:36.213
But unnecessary.

27:36.281 --> 27:37.747
Because he is

27:37.816 --> 27:39.616
absolutely blameless here.

27:41.019 --> 27:44.354
Now...

27:44.423 --> 27:47.224
let's start to talk
about my deal.

27:48.927 --> 27:52.229
His story bears out.
At least on paper.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.598
Wire transfer from
a Cayman account

27:54.666 --> 27:57.968
in Jax's name to a Cayman
account in Ridwan's name.

27:58.036 --> 27:59.703
Yeah, along with
a series of e-mails,

27:59.771 --> 28:01.404
supposedly from Jax,

28:01.473 --> 28:03.873
setting the whole thing
into motion.

28:03.942 --> 28:05.108
Wong covered his bases.

28:05.177 --> 28:07.477
We thought catching Ridwan
would help exonerate Jax,

28:07.546 --> 28:10.113
but he flipped the script
to make her look even worse.

28:10.182 --> 28:12.215
And we still don't know
where Wong is.

28:12.284 --> 28:13.950
He was supposed to be
on his private plane

28:14.019 --> 28:15.819
out of MSY an hour ago.

28:15.887 --> 28:18.221
I had them hold the plane
for FBI to go collect him,

28:18.290 --> 28:19.723
but he never showed.

28:19.791 --> 28:20.849
You think somebody
tipped him off?

28:20.873 --> 28:21.959
Possible.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.094
My guess is he knew
we'd try to detain him.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.140
Means he's probably still
somewhere in New Orleans.

28:26.164 --> 28:28.244
We can get another bite
of the apple.

28:30.469 --> 28:33.570
It's Wong who just took
another bite.

28:33.639 --> 28:35.238
What happened?

28:35.307 --> 28:37.974
If you're just tuning
in, you're watching footage

28:38.043 --> 28:40.310
of the aftermath
of the U.S. commando raid

28:40.379 --> 28:44.414
against Victor Zelko,
carried out sometime in 2017.

28:44.516 --> 28:47.317
The video was leaked to
news outlets this afternoon,

28:47.386 --> 28:49.519
and the footage is
absolutely heartbreaking.

28:49.588 --> 28:51.588
U.S. officials have vowed

28:51.657 --> 28:53.823
to get to the bottom
of this catastrophe.

28:53.892 --> 28:58.361
Our sources within the DoD have
confirmed that a top secret...

29:09.723 --> 29:12.290
Hannah, you okay?

29:15.262 --> 29:18.096
I just need a minute.

29:22.369 --> 29:26.738
Wong threatened Hannah,
and he leaked that video.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.473
Looks like arresting Ridwan

29:28.542 --> 29:31.309
and grounding Wong's plane
made him pull the trigger

29:31.378 --> 29:32.911
on that threat.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.779
It has to mean that we're close.

29:34.848 --> 29:36.781
If she's involved,
the news report

29:36.850 --> 29:38.216
didn't mention any names,

29:38.285 --> 29:40.285
so that's got to be
a good thing, right?

29:40.353 --> 29:44.255
Wong's holding the names back...
for now.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.124
We got to play this just right.

29:46.193 --> 29:48.760
Ridwan's his right-hand
man. We got him.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.296
I'm gonna go back in and
turn the screws some more.

29:51.364 --> 29:53.431
Give it a try.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.067
Meanwhile, we need to find out
where Wong is

29:56.136 --> 29:57.168
without him knowing it.

29:57.237 --> 29:58.937
Right.

30:02.542 --> 30:05.210
I'm still trying
to get ahold of Liam.

30:05.278 --> 30:06.611
Let him know what's happening.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.347
But he's not answering.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.583
Liam chose his own path.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.687
I'm more concerned
about you.

30:15.755 --> 30:16.821
You were right.

30:18.158 --> 30:19.424
I should have stood down.

30:19.493 --> 30:20.803
It wouldn't have
changed anything.

30:20.827 --> 30:23.628
Wong was gonna play
this the same way.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.331
Maybe I deserve this.

30:26.399 --> 30:29.200
Hannah...
Innocent people were killed.

30:29.269 --> 30:32.770
I was so righteous
when Liam told me, but I...

30:32.839 --> 30:34.339
I didn't know.

30:34.407 --> 30:36.107
What's happening here
is blackmail.

30:36.176 --> 30:37.542
None of it's on you.

30:37.611 --> 30:40.512
And a lot more innocent people
are gonna get hurt

30:40.580 --> 30:42.313
unless we stop Norman Wong.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.193
I don't want the team to get
caught in the crossfire.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.350
I need to do this alone.

30:45.418 --> 30:47.118
Not your choice to make.

30:48.755 --> 30:51.990
We're in this together,
no matter what.

30:52.058 --> 30:55.627
Guys, Homeland Security
just got here.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.467
Parker.

31:02.536 --> 31:04.068
I'm here for
Special Agent Khoury.

31:04.137 --> 31:05.503
That was fast.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.539
Raid footage was just leaked
a few minutes ago.

31:07.607 --> 31:08.640
To the media.

31:08.708 --> 31:10.475
However, it turns out NSA

31:10.544 --> 31:13.178
has the capacity to detect
when a file has been stolen.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.513
FBI and DHS were
alerted yesterday.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.749
I need you to come with me
for debrief.

31:17.817 --> 31:18.850
Not gonna work.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.552
We're in the middle
of an investigation.

31:20.620 --> 31:22.420
We need all hands on deck.

31:22.489 --> 31:23.721
This isn't a request.

31:23.790 --> 31:25.089
The raid was last year.

31:25.158 --> 31:27.859
Her story's gonna be the same
tomorrow as it is today.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.261
Don't make this hard on me.
I'm the messenger.

31:30.330 --> 31:32.063
The call came in from D.C.

31:32.132 --> 31:33.398
Ah.

31:33.466 --> 31:34.666
Just following orders, huh?

31:34.734 --> 31:35.912
Well,
I'm special agent in charge.

31:35.936 --> 31:38.670
I can make calls, too.
Where should I start?

31:38.738 --> 31:40.338
Way above your pay grade,
Dwayne.

31:40.407 --> 31:41.407
Try me.

31:42.809 --> 31:44.209
No, she's right.

31:45.312 --> 31:47.545
I have to go with her.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.780
Please stay on the case.

31:48.848 --> 31:51.749
It's the only way
you can help me now.

32:00.827 --> 32:01.960
Where's DHS taking Hannah?

32:02.028 --> 32:03.661
To the gallows.

32:03.730 --> 32:04.662
We can't let her go.

32:04.731 --> 32:06.598
Nothing we can do
about it now.

32:06.666 --> 32:09.467
We need to focus
on Araminta.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.369
Tell me you got
something on Wong.

32:11.438 --> 32:12.438
Yeah, we might.

32:12.505 --> 32:14.038
Patton was analyzing
the drone footage.

32:14.107 --> 32:15.640
It was definitely leaked
by the NSA.

32:15.709 --> 32:17.375
Wong clearly has
a contact there.

32:17.444 --> 32:18.610
Yeah, but we got a plan.

32:18.678 --> 32:20.445
So, back in the days
of telegraphing,

32:20.513 --> 32:22.914
operators used to be able
to recognize each other by ear.

32:22.983 --> 32:24.916
Okay, so the way that messages
were tapped out,

32:24.985 --> 32:28.152
whether it was, uh,
letter groupings or pauses,

32:28.221 --> 32:30.088
each one was unique
to that person.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.624
Like handwriting analysis.

32:32.692 --> 32:33.574
Yeah, exactly.

32:33.575 --> 32:36.437
So you want to find Wong from
the pattern of how he types?

32:36.438 --> 32:38.830
Yeah. If we can get his signature,
then it doesn't matter

32:38.898 --> 32:41.666
whether or not he's using a-a
burner or a fake e-mail address.

32:41.735 --> 32:43.935
He can't change the way
that he hits the keys.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.903
This is legal?

32:45.972 --> 32:48.172
Not in the strictest definition.

32:48.241 --> 32:50.608
Not in any definition, really.

32:53.313 --> 32:55.580
What do you need
to make it happen?

32:55.649 --> 32:58.116
<i>So, you need this because</i>

32:58.184 --> 33:00.118
Wong hacked into my computer

33:00.186 --> 33:02.086
and-and you can hack him back?

33:02.155 --> 33:03.821
Mm-hmm.
Sort of.

33:03.890 --> 33:06.424
We think he installed some kind
of spyware on your computer.

33:06.493 --> 33:07.970
Yeah, so that he could track
your communications

33:07.994 --> 33:10.528
but also plant e-mails
or wire transfers.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.008
But we can use the
spyware to exploit

33:12.032 --> 33:13.464
an open channel to him.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.199
Yeah, then we'll monitor
his keystrokes,

33:15.268 --> 33:17.935
mount our own attack.
I'm a structural engineer.

33:18.004 --> 33:19.644
I don't understand
anything you just said.

33:20.407 --> 33:22.307
But go for it.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.142
All right. Oh,
it's only fair to warn you,

33:24.210 --> 33:25.210
um, this isn't

33:25.245 --> 33:27.278
entirely aboveboard.

33:27.347 --> 33:30.048
If it takes Wong down,
I'm all in, no matter what.

33:30.116 --> 33:32.317
I like you.

33:35.522 --> 33:36.854
At the moment,

33:36.923 --> 33:39.057
we're in a preliminary
fact-finding stage,

33:39.125 --> 33:40.858
gathering information
as we try to ascertain

33:40.927 --> 33:42.393
how the Zelko footage
got leaked.

33:42.462 --> 33:44.062
I can tell you
how it got leaked.

33:44.130 --> 33:45.341
We'll get to your
theory in a moment.

33:45.365 --> 33:47.198
First, I'm gonna ask
you some questions.

33:47.267 --> 33:48.533
Don't worry,
they're easy ones.

33:48.601 --> 33:49.834
I have nothing to hide.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.235
Good.

33:51.304 --> 33:53.416
Had you ever seen this footage
before it was released?

33:53.440 --> 33:54.272
No, ma'am.

33:54.341 --> 33:55.440
So you had no idea

33:55.508 --> 33:57.019
there was collateral damage
from the raid.

33:57.043 --> 33:59.577
I hadn't seen the footage.
Yeah.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.245
We established that.

34:01.314 --> 34:05.016
I'm asking if you knew about the
civilian deaths before today.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.018
Not officially.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.920
Officially or unofficially,
are you saying you were aware

34:09.989 --> 34:12.255
Zelko's family was killed
in the operation?

34:12.324 --> 34:13.658
It's complicated.

34:13.693 --> 34:15.293
It shouldn't be,
Special Agent Khoury.

34:15.328 --> 34:17.594
Either you knew
or you didn't know.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.831
I heard a rumor.

34:19.899 --> 34:21.199
When?
I can't say.

34:21.266 --> 34:22.699
Who told you?
I can't say.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.601
What can you say?

34:24.670 --> 34:25.603
I can say

34:25.672 --> 34:27.871
that Norman Wong is responsible

34:27.940 --> 34:29.607
for the leaked video footage.

34:29.676 --> 34:32.275
Probably has a contact
in the NSA.

34:32.344 --> 34:33.543
You should check it out.

34:33.612 --> 34:34.824
And why are you so sure of that?

34:34.848 --> 34:35.958
'Cause he presented me
with images

34:35.982 --> 34:38.382
from the footage
hours before it was leaked.

34:42.355 --> 34:44.856
What are you doing?

34:44.924 --> 34:46.964
You said you have nothing
to hide, but you're unable

34:47.025 --> 34:50.428
or unwilling to answer
any questions directly.

34:51.831 --> 34:54.264
What am I supposed
to take away from that?

34:57.437 --> 35:00.972
Maybe your questions
aren't that easy after all.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.778
<i>So Araminta</i>

35:06.846 --> 35:09.158
worked with us through the night
trying to hack Wong's computer,

35:09.182 --> 35:10.815
but we made her leave
for this part.

35:10.884 --> 35:13.050
What do you have?

35:13.119 --> 35:14.652
What don't we have?

35:14.721 --> 35:16.721
Wong's e-mails,

35:16.790 --> 35:18.823
browser history,
bank accounts around the world,

35:18.892 --> 35:20.658
secure cell phone number.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.493
You have his location?

35:22.562 --> 35:25.296
That's the, uh, the one thing
we don't have yet.

35:25.365 --> 35:27.598
But we got enough proof
that Wong was behind poisoning

35:27.667 --> 35:30.902
Jax Inc. employees
and setting Jax up.

35:30.970 --> 35:34.172
Yeah, including paying off
the mid-level NSA contractor

35:34.240 --> 35:36.340
to leak that Zelko raid footage.

35:36.409 --> 35:37.620
Which is not admissible,

35:37.644 --> 35:38.576
considering how we got it.

35:38.645 --> 35:39.944
We got one idea,

35:40.013 --> 35:41.979
but it could backfire
in a federal way.

35:42.048 --> 35:44.415
Yeah. Wong's an economic
hit man, right?

35:44.484 --> 35:46.617
He's purely in it for the money,
he's got millions.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.686
Which we got
complete control of.

35:50.256 --> 35:52.356
You saying you can freeze
his bank accounts?

35:52.425 --> 35:53.958
I can freeze them, heat them,

35:54.060 --> 35:55.293
sauté them
in butter, baby.

35:55.361 --> 35:56.694
And we can even drain it.

35:56.763 --> 35:57.795
You can do that?

35:57.864 --> 35:59.163
With the click of a button.

36:00.567 --> 36:02.500
Do it.

36:02.569 --> 36:05.503
And get his phone number to me.
I'm gonna need it.

36:08.107 --> 36:09.874
<i>We need to be</i>
<i>out of New Orleans</i>

36:09.943 --> 36:12.176
and on the water
in the next hour.

36:12.245 --> 36:13.511
We're doing the best we can.

36:13.580 --> 36:14.990
Just trying to track
a course around...

36:15.014 --> 36:16.848
Stop talking.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.886
What the...?

36:32.265 --> 36:33.564
Hello?

36:33.633 --> 36:34.999
Mr. Wong.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.068
Special Agent Pride from NCIS.

36:37.136 --> 36:39.170
Thinking you might want
to sit down with me,

36:39.239 --> 36:41.706
talk about certain
financial matters.

36:43.042 --> 36:45.409
Well, Special Agent,

36:45.478 --> 36:48.246
you've certainly got
my attention.

37:02.558 --> 37:03.967
I have to tip my hat to you.

37:03.968 --> 37:05.334
It is very rare

37:05.403 --> 37:08.337
that someone manages
to surprise me.

37:10.074 --> 37:12.241
Well, I'm not here
for your admiration.

37:12.309 --> 37:15.210
No. You're here to leverage me
into confessing to a felony,

37:15.279 --> 37:16.167
but you've overplayed
your hand.

37:16.191 --> 37:17.447
How's that?

37:17.448 --> 37:20.249
You may have control
over my money,

37:20.317 --> 37:22.017
but I have information.

37:22.086 --> 37:23.852
Do you know
the secrets

37:23.921 --> 37:25.487
that your team is keeping?

37:25.556 --> 37:28.824
I have information, too.

37:28.893 --> 37:31.660
Every shred of data
from your computer.

37:31.729 --> 37:33.040
Which we both know
was obtained illegally.

37:33.064 --> 37:36.065
You can't charge me, arrest me

37:36.133 --> 37:38.534
or hurt me in any way.

37:38.602 --> 37:40.436
Well, you got me wrong.

37:40.504 --> 37:43.038
I have no intention
of arresting you.

37:43.107 --> 37:47.409
But hurting you,
that is an option.

37:49.113 --> 37:51.180
And how would you do that?

37:51.248 --> 37:54.016
There are some high-level
officials in your contact list.

37:54.085 --> 37:57.953
Boldfaced operators who would
not appreciate being exposed.

37:58.022 --> 38:02.391
I can make you very lonely
out there, Mr. Wong.

38:02.460 --> 38:04.026
Ruin you.

38:04.095 --> 38:06.028
And of course,
I'd ruin you right back,

38:06.097 --> 38:08.597
along with every other member
of your team.

38:08.666 --> 38:10.566
Mutually assured destruction.

38:10.634 --> 38:12.901
You have a proposal.

38:12.970 --> 38:14.570
Even trade.

38:14.638 --> 38:18.207
Everything I have on you
for everything you have

38:18.275 --> 38:22.044
on the Zelko raid and Special
Agent Khoury's involvement.

38:22.113 --> 38:24.913
And what about Jax Inc.?

38:24.982 --> 38:26.748
You back off.

38:26.817 --> 38:29.818
Leave Araminta alone.

38:29.887 --> 38:32.921
Damage has already been done
to her reputation,

38:32.990 --> 38:36.325
whether or not she goes to jail.

38:36.393 --> 38:38.427
Her company's done.

38:39.730 --> 38:42.598
NCIS will drop its case
against me?

38:44.335 --> 38:45.601
What case?

38:47.671 --> 38:50.239
This has the encryption key

38:50.307 --> 38:52.241
you'll need
to get your money back.

38:52.309 --> 38:56.745
In return, you'll give me
all the files on the Zelko raid.

39:05.890 --> 39:09.258
You know what will happen
if you don't keep your word.

39:09.326 --> 39:11.693
I always keep my word.

39:16.267 --> 39:18.667
What is this?
W-What's going on?

39:18.736 --> 39:20.602
We-we just made a deal.
I promised you

39:20.671 --> 39:23.872
NCIS wouldn't
pursue you anymore.

39:23.941 --> 39:26.375
I didn't say anything
about the FBI.

39:26.443 --> 39:28.043
You're wired?

39:28.112 --> 39:30.779
And you just accepted
the flash drive from me,

39:30.848 --> 39:32.447
which is an admission
of guilt

39:32.516 --> 39:34.816
to half a dozen felonies.

39:39.356 --> 39:41.623
You stole my money.

39:41.692 --> 39:43.458
We didn't steal it, Mr. Wong.

39:43.527 --> 39:45.961
We just made it look
like it was stolen.

39:46.030 --> 39:47.863
Every dollar
is where it should be.

39:47.932 --> 39:50.399
Until the FBI seizes it.

39:54.705 --> 39:57.472
You think I'm just going
to let you get away with this?

39:57.541 --> 39:59.808
I think you don't have a choice.

40:01.912 --> 40:04.646
You know, some people come
down here to New Orleans,

40:04.715 --> 40:06.481
and think they can
push us around.

40:07.785 --> 40:11.186
Some people end up
getting their asses kicked.

40:12.489 --> 40:14.523
Get him out of here.

40:21.799 --> 40:25.400
All charges dropped. NOPD says
I can go back to my life.

40:25.469 --> 40:27.569
I'm free to go, just like that.

40:27.638 --> 40:30.439
Well, it wasn't easy,
but we're happy for you.

40:30.507 --> 40:33.842
You believed in me
when no one else would.

40:33.911 --> 40:35.477
I don't know how to thank you.

40:35.546 --> 40:37.212
Well, I know
one thing you can do.

40:37.281 --> 40:39.047
Get busy.

40:39.116 --> 40:40.449
Make Jax Inc. happen.

40:40.517 --> 40:41.717
We need people like you.

40:41.785 --> 40:43.151
Well, it's gonna take a minute

40:43.220 --> 40:46.555
to undo all the damage,
but don't worry,

40:46.624 --> 40:49.024
I'm never gonna
give up on my company.

40:49.093 --> 40:50.592
Good.

40:50.661 --> 40:52.594
Is Special Agent Pride here?

40:52.663 --> 40:54.863
I... I want to thank him, too.

40:54.932 --> 40:59.101
No, he had someone else
who needed his help.

41:00.671 --> 41:03.205
We can go
around again,

41:03.274 --> 41:04.985
but I have nothing left
to say about the raid.

41:05.009 --> 41:07.209
That's okay.
We're done here.

41:07.278 --> 41:09.945
I got confirmation that
Norman Wong leaked the footage.

41:10.014 --> 41:11.947
And his contact at NSA.

41:12.016 --> 41:13.248
How?

41:18.455 --> 41:19.988
Dwayne.

41:20.057 --> 41:21.223
What did you do?

41:21.292 --> 41:23.125
Pulled a rabbit out of a hat.

41:23.193 --> 41:24.559
You're free to go.

41:26.163 --> 41:28.497
Can we have the room
for a minute?

41:28.565 --> 41:30.499
Thank you.
You're welcome.

41:33.003 --> 41:35.237
Please tell me you didn't
put yourself at risk.

41:35.306 --> 41:37.239
You really want to know?

41:37.308 --> 41:39.741
I guess I have my answer.

41:39.810 --> 41:42.744
I need to show you something
the FBI found

41:42.813 --> 41:44.146
on Norman Wong's computer.

41:44.214 --> 41:46.648
Is it something else
about the Zelko raid?

41:46.717 --> 41:48.517
Why don't you sit down?

41:52.189 --> 41:55.157
These were taken
a few weeks ago.

41:55.225 --> 41:57.759
I don't understand.

42:09.907 --> 42:12.674
Victor Zelko's still alive?

42:20.207 --> 42:27.207
