KATARA: <i>Water.</i>

00:04.920 --> 00:06.300
<i>Earth.</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:08.380
<i>Fire.</i>

00:09.010 --> 00:10.300
<i>Air.</i>

00:11.220 --> 00:14.600
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.430 --> 00:19.230
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.690 --> 00:22.570
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

00:22.650 --> 00:23.730
<i>could stop them.</i>

00:23.820 --> 00:26.610
<i>But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.</i>

00:27.400 --> 00:28.450
<i>100 years passed,</i>

00:28.530 --> 00:31.240
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:31.320 --> 00:32.830
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:33.120 --> 00:35.200
<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

00:35.290 --> 00:38.460
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone,</i>

00:39.080 --> 00:42.090
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

00:56.350 --> 00:57.350
Look!

01:04.280 --> 01:05.650
He is taunting us.

01:06.740 --> 01:08.200
You are so going to be dinner.

01:10.620 --> 01:12.700
Hey, where's the fishing line?

01:12.790 --> 01:15.290
Oh, I didn't think
you would need it, Sokka.

01:16.290 --> 01:17.830
Ah, it's all tangled.

01:18.670 --> 01:20.420
Not tangled, woven.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.170
I made you a necklace, Katara.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.880
I thought since you lost
your other one...

01:28.180 --> 01:29.180
Thanks, Aang.

01:29.260 --> 01:30.260
I love it.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.680
Great, Aang.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.270
Maybe instead of saving the world,

01:33.350 --> 01:34.980
you can go
into the jewelry-making business.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.100
I don't see why I can't do both.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.690
Huh!

01:40.770 --> 01:42.070
Stop taunting me!

01:44.780 --> 01:45.860
Uhh!

01:45.940 --> 01:47.360
KATARA: So, how do I look?

01:53.080 --> 01:55.290
You mean, all of you
or just your neck―

01:55.370 --> 01:57.210
I mean, because they both look great.

01:57.580 --> 01:58.920
Smoochie smoochie.

01:59.210 --> 02:01.460
Someone's in love.

02:02.130 --> 02:03.750
I, well―

02:04.250 --> 02:05.630
Stop teasing him, Sokka.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.470
Aang's just a good friend,

02:07.550 --> 02:10.340
a sweet little guy, just like Momo.

02:10.640 --> 02:11.640
Thanks.

( GROWLING )

02:17.430 --> 02:19.390
Someone's being attacked
by a platypus bear!

02:32.030 --> 02:33.070
Well, hello there.

02:33.830 --> 02:35.370
Nice day, isn't it?

02:35.540 --> 02:37.000
Make noise! He'll run off!

02:37.080 --> 02:38.960
No, play dead! He'll lose interest!

02:39.540 --> 02:42.330
Whoa, close one. Ha ha ha.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.750
Run downhill, then climb a tree!

02:44.840 --> 02:46.340
No, punch him in the bill!

02:46.420 --> 02:47.880
And then run in zig-zags.

02:48.630 --> 02:49.720
No need.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.090
It's going to be fine.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.520
Whoa, there.

03:02.270 --> 03:04.610
( ROARS )

03:09.530 --> 03:11.200
Mmm, lunch.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.410
( SNIFFS )

03:12.490 --> 03:14.280
Lucky for you we came along.

03:14.490 --> 03:17.950
Thanks, but everything
was already under control.

03:18.410 --> 03:19.790
Not to worry.

03:19.870 --> 03:22.790
Aunt Wu predicted
I'd have a safe journey.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.170
Aunt who?

03:24.250 --> 03:25.840
No, Aunt Wu.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.550
She's the fortune-teller
from my village.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.300
Awful nice knowing your future.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.300
Wow, it must be.

03:33.590 --> 03:35.350
That explains why you were so calm.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.720
But the fortune-teller was wrong.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.060
You didn't have a safe journey.

03:39.140 --> 03:40.180
You were almost killed.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.020
But I wasn't.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.900
All right, have a good one.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.400
Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met
any travelers, to give them this.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.030
Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu
and learn our fortunes.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.410
It could be fun.

03:58.490 --> 04:01.370
Oh, come on.
Fortune-telling is nonsense.

04:02.460 --> 04:03.460
What do you know?

04:03.540 --> 04:04.540
An umbrella.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.920
( THUNDER )

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
That proves it.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.210
No, it doesn't.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.710
You can't really tell the future.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.220
I guess you're not
really getting wet, then.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.510
Whoa― Aah!

04:17.930 --> 04:18.930
Of course she predicted

04:19.010 --> 04:20.010
it was gonna rain.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.430
The sky has been grey all day.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.270
Just admit you might be wrong,

04:23.350 --> 04:24.730
and you can come under the umbrella.

04:25.770 --> 04:27.560
Look, I'm gonna
predict the future now.

04:27.650 --> 04:30.480
It's going to keep drizzling.

04:31.940 --> 04:33.240
See?

04:34.950 --> 04:36.740
Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.

04:40.370 --> 04:41.370
Aah!

04:51.590 --> 04:53.720
( QUACKING )

04:56.510 --> 04:59.260
Aunt Wu is expecting you.

04:59.640 --> 05:00.930
Really?

05:01.010 --> 05:02.100
Pfft.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.060
My name is Meng,
and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.780
Well, hello there.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.240
Hello.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.660
Can I get you some tea

05:20.740 --> 05:23.160
or some of Aunt Wu's
special bean curd puffs?

05:23.620 --> 05:24.620
I'll try a curd puff.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.710
Just a second.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.120
So, what's your name?

05:27.210 --> 05:28.210
Aang.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.590
That rhymes with Meng,

05:30.670 --> 05:33.460
and you've got some pretty big ears,
don't you?

05:34.460 --> 05:35.920
I guess.

05:36.340 --> 05:37.550
Don't be modest.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.640
They're huge.

05:38.970 --> 05:41.430
Well, Aang, it's very nice
to meet you―

05:41.890 --> 05:43.060
Very nice.

05:43.140 --> 05:44.430
Likewise.

05:45.350 --> 05:46.640
I can't believe we're here

05:46.730 --> 05:47.940
in the house of nonsense.

05:48.350 --> 05:50.560
Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.

05:50.650 --> 05:51.810
There are things in this world

05:51.900 --> 05:53.320
that just can't be explained.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.990
Wouldn't it be nice to have
some insight into your future?

05:56.070 --> 05:58.490
It would be nice
to have some bean curd puffs.

06:00.530 --> 06:02.030
Oh, Meng!

06:02.120 --> 06:04.910
Aunt Wu says
I'm going to meet my true love!

06:05.330 --> 06:08.160
He's going to give me
a rare panda lily.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.880
That's so romantic.

06:11.460 --> 06:14.960
I wonder if my true love
will give me a rare flower.

06:15.050 --> 06:16.340
Good luck with that.

06:16.420 --> 06:17.510
( CHUCKLE )

06:17.590 --> 06:20.890
Is that the big-eared guy
who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?

06:24.850 --> 06:25.850
Aah!

06:29.560 --> 06:30.810
Enjoy your snack.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.440
Welcome, young travelers.

06:35.530 --> 06:36.650
Now, who's next?

06:37.280 --> 06:38.900
Don't be shy.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.660
I guess that's me.

06:44.910 --> 06:46.870
Not bad, not bad.

06:46.950 --> 06:48.870
Mmm! Mmm!

06:49.250 --> 06:50.370
Hmm?

06:50.670 --> 06:52.130
I'm good on puffs.

06:52.210 --> 06:53.460
Hmm.

06:54.210 --> 06:57.710
So, what do you think
they're talking about back there?

06:57.800 --> 06:59.260
Boring stuff, I'm sure.

06:59.340 --> 07:00.930
Love, who she's gonna marry,

07:01.010 --> 07:02.720
how many babies she's gonna have.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.220
Yeah, dumb stuff like that.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.390
Well, I gotta find a bathroom.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.480
AUNT WU: Your palms are so smooth.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.900
Do you use moisturizer?

07:16.980 --> 07:19.780
KATARA: Actually,
I have this special seaweed lotion.

07:20.030 --> 07:22.200
I could get you some if you want.

07:22.280 --> 07:25.530
So, do you see anything
interesting in my love line?

07:25.620 --> 07:28.200
I see a great romance for you―

07:28.790 --> 07:30.290
The man you're going to marry.

07:30.370 --> 07:31.710
Tell me more!

07:31.790 --> 07:35.840
I can see
that he's a very powerful bender.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.010
Looks like someone
had a pretty good bathroom break.

07:46.850 --> 07:48.470
Yeah, when I was in there―

07:48.560 --> 07:49.720
I don't even want to know.

07:49.810 --> 07:50.980
Who's next?

07:51.060 --> 07:53.100
Ok, let's get this over with.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.690
Your future is full
of struggle and anguish,

07:56.770 --> 07:59.650
most of it self-inflicted.

08:00.110 --> 08:02.030
But you didn't read
my palms or anything.

08:02.450 --> 08:03.740
I don't need to.

08:03.820 --> 08:05.530
It's written all over your face.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.040
You there, come with me.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.460
This is the most reliable method
of telling your fortune.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.500
The bones never lie.

08:19.050 --> 08:20.760
Go on. Pick one.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.630
Now throw it on the fire.

08:25.590 --> 08:28.010
The heat makes cracks in the bones,

08:28.430 --> 08:31.680
and I read the bone cracks
to tell your destiny.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.060
AANG: Wow, that's a big crack.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.270
I've never seen this before.

08:40.860 --> 08:41.860
( GASPS )

08:41.980 --> 08:43.150
Oh, my!

08:49.910 --> 08:52.700
Your destiny― This is incredible.

08:52.790 --> 08:56.500
You will be involved
in a great battle―

08:56.580 --> 09:00.380
An awesome conflict
between the forces of good and evil.

09:00.460 --> 09:05.050
A battle whose outcome will determine
the fate of the whole world.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.140
Yeah, yeah. I knew that already,

09:07.220 --> 09:08.800
But did it say anything about a girl?

09:09.180 --> 09:10.220
A girl?

09:10.300 --> 09:11.970
You want to know about love?

09:12.060 --> 09:13.180
Yes!

09:13.890 --> 09:15.600
I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.560
Oh, look!

09:19.650 --> 09:21.360
I must have missed something.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.110
Right here.

09:23.190 --> 09:28.320
It says, "trust your heart, and you
will be with the one you love."

09:28.660 --> 09:29.820
Really?

09:29.910 --> 09:31.080
Thank you, Aunt Wu!

09:34.080 --> 09:35.710
SOKKA: Well, now you got to see
for yourselves

09:35.790 --> 09:38.210
that fortune-telling
is just a big, stupid hoax.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.670
You're just saying that

09:39.750 --> 09:41.840
because you're gonna make yourself
unhappy your whole life.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.550
That woman is crazy!

09:44.010 --> 09:47.590
My life will be calm and happy
and joyful!

09:48.550 --> 09:49.640
Ow!

09:50.640 --> 09:52.310
That doesn't prove anything.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.270
Well, I liked my predictions.

09:54.680 --> 09:57.140
Certain things
are gonna turn out very well.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.940
They sure are.

09:59.020 --> 10:00.100
Why?

10:00.190 --> 10:01.190
What did she tell you?

10:01.650 --> 10:02.650
Some stuff.

10:02.730 --> 10:03.730
You'll find out.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.450
What's with the sky?

10:10.910 --> 10:13.490
We're waiting for Aunt Wu
to come and read the clouds

10:13.580 --> 10:15.500
to predict the fate
of the whole village.

10:15.580 --> 10:17.750
That cloud kind of looks
like a fluffy bunny.

10:18.290 --> 10:20.330
You better hope that's not a bunny.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.460
The fluffy bunny cloud
forecasts doom and destruction.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.460
Do you even hear yourself?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.970
The cloud reading
will tell us if Mount Makapu

10:28.050 --> 10:30.130
will remain dormant for another year

10:30.220 --> 10:31.220
or if it will erupt.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.850
We used to have
a tradition once a year

10:33.930 --> 10:35.100
of going up the mountain

10:35.180 --> 10:36.850
to check the volcano ourselves,

10:37.270 --> 10:38.890
But ever since Aunt Wu

10:38.980 --> 10:40.980
moved to the village 20 years ago,

10:41.060 --> 10:44.190
we have a tradition of not doing that.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.530
I can't believe
you would trust your lives

10:46.610 --> 10:48.690
to that crazy
old woman's superstition!

10:49.280 --> 10:50.820
Shh! She's coming.

10:52.490 --> 10:54.830
( CHEERING )

10:54.910 --> 10:56.330
Hey, Aang,

10:56.410 --> 10:59.580
don't you think that cloud
looks like a flower, huh?

11:00.290 --> 11:02.170
Sure, I guess.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.420
Hey, Katara, don't you think
that cloud looks like a flower?

11:05.500 --> 11:06.550
Shh!

11:13.260 --> 11:15.430
Bending arrow cloud―

11:15.510 --> 11:19.060
Good crops this year.
Nice, big harvest.

11:19.390 --> 11:21.440
Darn good news!

11:21.850 --> 11:25.440
Wavy moon-shaped cloud― Let's see.

11:26.070 --> 11:28.900
Gonna be a great year for twins.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.320
- Yes!
- Yes!

11:30.990 --> 11:35.160
And a cumulus cloud with a twisty
nub coming off the end of it―

11:35.740 --> 11:40.250
The village will not be destroyed
by the volcano this year!

11:40.660 --> 11:41.710
( CHEERING )

11:42.330 --> 11:43.960
Since I got you here,

11:44.040 --> 11:46.130
there's something I want to tell you.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.460
I like you, but more than normal.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.840
Never mind.

11:58.720 --> 11:59.850
Hi, Aunt Wu.

11:59.930 --> 12:01.060
Sorry to bother you.

12:01.140 --> 12:02.270
Anytime.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.310
About this man I'm supposed to marry―

12:04.400 --> 12:05.610
Is he gonna be handsome?

12:05.690 --> 12:06.900
Oh, I hope he's tall.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.400
Ah. You want another reading.

12:10.610 --> 12:11.610
Yes, please.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.530
I can't believe all these saps.

12:16.950 --> 12:19.200
Someone really needs
to scream some sense at them.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.250
They seem happy, Sokka.

12:21.330 --> 12:22.660
Not for long.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.170

Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.130
Hey, you,

12:27.210 --> 12:29.920
I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear
those red shoes, didn't she?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.300
Yeah, she said
I'd be wearing red shoes

12:32.380 --> 12:33.630
when I met my true love.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.010
Uh-huh.

12:35.090 --> 12:36.590
And how many times
have you worn those shoes

12:36.680 --> 12:37.930
since you got that fortune?

12:38.010 --> 12:39.260
Every day.

12:40.180 --> 12:42.520
Then of course it's gonna come true!

12:43.060 --> 12:44.730
Really? You think so?

12:44.810 --> 12:46.560
I'm so excited!

12:47.100 --> 12:48.110
Uhh!

12:48.190 --> 12:49.400
( SQUAWKING )

12:49.480 --> 12:52.190
Aah! Uhh!

12:53.070 --> 12:55.570
And then you'll have
your third great grandchild

12:55.660 --> 12:58.700
before quietly
passing away in your sleep.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.410
Is that enough information for you?

13:00.870 --> 13:03.500
Wow. Thanks, Aunt Wu.

13:03.580 --> 13:05.410
Oh, wait. One more thing.

13:05.870 --> 13:08.080
How warmly should I dress tomorrow?

13:08.420 --> 13:10.420
You want me to do a reading for that?

13:12.090 --> 13:14.380
I don't care what Aunt Wu told you!

13:14.470 --> 13:16.800
You have to take a bath sometime!

13:17.090 --> 13:18.180
( CHUCKLING )

13:20.890 --> 13:23.850
So, Sokka, you know some stuff
about ladies, right?

13:23.930 --> 13:25.100
Some stuff?

13:25.180 --> 13:26.890
You've come to the right place.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.400
What can I do you for?

13:28.810 --> 13:30.270
Well, there's this girl...

13:30.940 --> 13:32.110
( GIGGLING )

13:32.440 --> 13:34.320
I think I know who you mean.

13:34.650 --> 13:36.490
You do? And you're ok with it?

13:36.570 --> 13:37.910
Of course I am.

13:37.990 --> 13:39.280
And to tell you the truth,

13:39.370 --> 13:41.330
I've been picking up
a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.

13:41.490 --> 13:42.490
She does?

13:42.790 --> 13:44.790
Oh, yeah. She's crazy about you.

13:44.870 --> 13:47.040
All you have to do now
is not mess it up.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.960
Well, how do I do that?

13:49.040 --> 13:51.210
The number one mistake
nice guys like you make―

13:51.290 --> 13:52.750
Being too nice.

13:53.210 --> 13:54.800
You can be too nice?

13:54.880 --> 13:57.170
Yep. If you want to
keep her interested,

13:57.260 --> 13:58.720
you have to act aloof,

13:59.090 --> 14:00.890
Like you don't really care
one way or the other.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.350
Well, ok.

14:03.430 --> 14:05.850
Hey, Aang. I was wondering―

14:05.930 --> 14:07.230
See you later.

14:07.770 --> 14:08.890
Hmm.

14:08.980 --> 14:11.560
Wow. That kid is good.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.730
And you'll be fine
as long as you've got a scarf.

14:15.030 --> 14:16.190
Bye-bye, now.

14:16.530 --> 14:18.900
Ok, ok. But one more thing.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.240
All right. What is it?

14:21.530 --> 14:24.830
Should I eat a mango or a papaya

14:24.910 --> 14:26.080
for breakfast tomorrow?

14:26.160 --> 14:27.580
Papaya.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.250
Oh, I hate papaya.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.330
Oh. Hey, Katara.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.500
I didn't see you there.

14:33.590 --> 14:35.210
Hey, Aang.

14:35.550 --> 14:36.710
That's ok.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.220
I'm busy with my own stuff.

14:45.430 --> 14:46.430
( QUACK )

14:46.890 --> 14:48.640
Ugh. Papaya, please.

14:49.850 --> 14:51.810
So, papaya.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.020
Uh-huh. Would you like some?

14:54.230 --> 14:55.360
You know me.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.110
I don't really care what I eat.

14:57.740 --> 14:58.740
Ok, then.

14:58.820 --> 14:59.860
See you later.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.610
Ugh!

15:02.160 --> 15:03.820
Maybe aloof isn't my style.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.660
Oh, a panda lily.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.250
Did you see that?

15:10.830 --> 15:13.790
Excuse me. Where can a guy
find one of those things?

15:15.340 --> 15:17.460
SOKKA: I can't believe you're
dragging me all the way up here

15:17.550 --> 15:19.050
For a stupid flower.

15:19.130 --> 15:22.050
Not just any flower― A panda lily.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.640
I've seen it in action,
and, boy, does it work.

15:25.510 --> 15:27.600
Flowers are fine once you're married,

15:27.680 --> 15:29.230
but at this early stage,

15:29.310 --> 15:32.350
it's critical that you maintain
maximum aloofness.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.110
But my heart
is telling me to get this flower,

15:35.360 --> 15:37.360
And Aunt Wu said
if I trusted my heart,

15:37.440 --> 15:38.980
I would be with the one I love.

15:39.490 --> 15:42.740
What? Don't tell me
you believe in that stuff, too.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.030
Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.660
Why should she be wrong about love?

15:50.290 --> 15:51.540
There, on the rim!

( GASP )

Oh, no.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.420

Those people all think they're safe.

16:13.810 --> 16:15.270
We've got to warn them.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.810
There's no time to walk.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.070
Grab on.

Aah!

16:28.530 --> 16:29.830
Hi, Katara.

16:29.910 --> 16:31.910
Can you believe she won't let me in?

16:32.160 --> 16:33.620
And after all the business
I've given her?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.080
But she doesn't even charge.

16:35.580 --> 16:36.710
I know, but still.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.210
Well, we have other things
to worry about.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.260
Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.

16:41.590 --> 16:44.180
Sokka, you tried to convince me
she was wrong before.

to change my―

is gonna blow any second!

16:53.600 --> 16:55.440

you don't believe in Aunt Wu,

If you won't listen to him,
maybe you'll listen to me.

I want to believe Aunt Wu and her
predictions as much as you do,

17:06.530 --> 17:08.740
but my brother and Aang saw the lava

17:08.820 --> 17:10.080
with their own eyes.

17:10.160 --> 17:14.830
Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction
with my own ears.

Please listen to us!

You can't rely
on Aunt Wu's predictions!

You have to take fate
into your own hands!

17:26.930 --> 17:27.930

17:28.010 --> 17:29.930
Can your fortune-telling explain that?

Heh. Can your science
explain why it rains?

17:35.890 --> 17:38.230
Yes! Yes, it can!

17:42.820 --> 17:44.740
They just won't listen to reason.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.240
But they will listen to Aunt Wu.

17:47.450 --> 17:49.110
I know. That's the problem.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.700
Well, it's about to become
the solution.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.520
Of course I like you.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.650

we can channel all the lava
