00:01.600 --> 00:03.300
I can't believe you've been going to gym

00:03.360 --> 00:04.700
all this time without a jockstrap.

00:04.760 --> 00:06.060
I don't like it.

00:06.130 --> 00:08.500
It feels like I'm flossing my butt crack.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.960
Based on what I'm paying your dentist,

00:10.030 --> 00:12.800
you know nothing about flossing.

00:12.860 --> 00:15.330
Think of it as a bra for your balls.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.000
Oh,now I want one.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.230
What size are you?

00:20.300 --> 00:21.930
How should I know?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.930
I think they havone ofhose measuring things.

00:25.130 --> 00:26.300
You know,like at the shoe store.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.430
Length,width.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.000
He's kidding,right?

00:29.060 --> 00:30.760
Yes,he's joking,

00:31.800 --> 00:34.460
Don't do that.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.100
Here,"teen."

00:36.160 --> 00:38.600
Think you can t your junk into that?

00:38.660 --> 00:40.560
I'll make it fit. Let's just go.

00:40.630 --> 00:42.860
No,no,put it on ||over your pants. We'll take a look.

00:42.930 --> 00:44.700
The heck|| you will.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.100
Charlie,you're embarrassing him.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.260
Of course I am.

00:47.330 --> 00:48.600
That's why I came.

00:48.660 --> 00:50.500
Oh,sorry,sorry. Excuse me.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.800
Charlie Harper?

00:51.860 --> 00:54.960
|| Where? He owes me money.

00:55.030 --> 00:55.860
Miss Pasternak?

00:55.930 --> 00:59.230
Jake! Wow,look at you.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.360
Look how much you've grown.

01:00.430 --> 01:01.760
I reached puberty.

01:01.830 --> 01:04.730
Oh,right,Miss Pasternak, fifth grade,

01:04.800 --> 01:06.860
Woodward Avenue Elementary School.

01:06.930 --> 01:08.900
o  Oh,yeah, Miss Pasternak!

01:09.930 --> 01:11.730
Oh,yeah, Miss Pasternak.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.160
So,are you still teaching?

01:14.230 --> 01:15.830
No. No,I'm not.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.100
|| How are you,Charlie?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.560
Good,goodNice to see you. Long time.

01:18.630 --> 01:19.860
You look terrific. Guess who's wearing a jock.

01:19.930 --> 01:21.800
Oh,how nice.

01:21.860 --> 01:23.400
Well,it's great to see you all.

01:23.460 --> 01:24.960
Good-bye.

01:25.030 --> 01:26.300
Bye,Miss Pasternak.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.800
Dodged a bullet there.

01:28.860 --> 01:30.260
I'll say.

01:30.330 --> 01:32.600
She was kind of shook up after I broke it off with her.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.800
Kind of shook up?

01:33.860 --> 01:35.700
She went bananas and bit the gym teacher.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.960
Where?

01:37.030 --> 01:39.230
In the gym.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.500
You miserable son of a bitch!

01:41.560 --> 01:43.600
en I gave you my heart, I gave you my soul,

01:43.660 --> 01:46.030
I gave you my bodyB@ and you just threw me aside

01:46.100 --> 01:47.900
like I was some piece of garbage!

01:47.960 --> 01:50.360
Yeah,my bad.

01:51.430 --> 01:52.300
So,what's new?

01:52.360 --> 01:53.600
Oh,you want to catch up?

01:53.660 --> 01:55.000
Yeah,sure,let's catch up.

01:55.060 --> 01:57.060
Let's see,um,well,okay, after you dumped me,

01:57.130 --> 01:58.830
I had a nervous breakdown.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.860
Well,it sure looks like you bounced back.

02:01.930 --> 02:04.060
And then after my breakdown,

02:04.130 --> 02:06.560
I got fired and blackballed from teaching.

02:06.630 --> 02:08.800
Oh... bummer.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.430
So,what are you up to now?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.130
I'll tell you what I'm up to now.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.460
I lost my house,I'm living in a cheap motel,

02:14.530 --> 02:17.000
and my new career is giving lap dances to strangers

02:17.060 --> 02:20.160
while I'm swinging by my crotch on a pole eight times a night.

02:20.230 --> 02:23.900
Have you considered an athletic supporter?

02:25.500 --> 02:27.930
Okay,well, thanks for thepdate.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.160
Nice seeing you.

02:29.230 --> 02:30.400
(hushed): Move,move,move.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.060
You ruined my life, Charlie Harper!

02:32.130 --> 02:33.730
Righto. Bye.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.160
We didn't pay for the jockstrap. Just keep walking.

02:35.230 --> 02:38.600
How can you live with yourself, you horrible evil man?!

02:38.660 --> 02:40.260
He drinks.

What are you watching?

03:11.860 --> 03:12.830
The Food Network.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.000
I'm learning how

03:14.060 --> 03:15.330
to prepare a cinnamon-apple cobbler.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.530
Tired of being at the mercy of the dealers,huh?

03:19.600 --> 03:20.960
What?

03:21.030 --> 03:22.530
Nothing,nothing.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.300
Listen,I think I owe you an apology.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.600
For what?

03:26.660 --> 03:28.730
You know,this morning in the drugstore?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.560
Oh,yeah,the jockstrap jokes.

03:30.630 --> 03:32.100
<i>You should be sorry.</i>

03:32.160 --> 03:34.200
||No,not the jockstrap jokes.

03:34.260 --> 03:37.360
Those were funny. I stand by those.

03:37.430 --> 03:40.500
I meant the run-in with your old teacher.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.800
You probably shouldn't have seen that.

03:42.860 --> 03:44.330
I've seen worse.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.660
Remember the Pilates instructor who threw

03:45.730 --> 03:48.230
the lit road flare through your bedroom window?

03:48.300 --> 03:50.960
Yeah. That was awesome.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.100
That's one word for it.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.960
Oh,and remember  the dental hygienist

03:55.030 --> 03:57.060
who ot your ass up full of Novocain?

03:57.130 --> 03:58.130
I do.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.460
That was so funny.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.300
You kept falling off the toilet.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.860
Yeah,good times.

04:05.930 --> 04:09.060
What do you do that gets these men so pissed off at you?

04:09.130 --> 04:11.560
It's hard to say exactly.

04:11.630 --> 04:13.800
I guess when a guy has an intimate relationship...

04:13.860 --> 04:15.430
Oh,remember the girl from the tanning salon

04:15.500 --> 04:17.760
who tried to shoot you with a bow and arrow?

04:17.829 --> 04:20.029
Yeah,Jake.

04:20.100 --> 04:24.300
My point is,I was wrong in the way I treated those women,

04:24.360 --> 04:26.500
and you should learn a lesson from my mistakes.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.060
You mean like keep a fire extinguisher by your bed?

04:29.130 --> 04:31.730
Sure,that's one lesson.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.500
An||d whenever a dental hygienist drops a quarter,

04:33.560 --> 04:35.430
never bend over to pick it up?

04:35.500 --> 04:37.400
Yeah,that,too.

04:37.460 --> 04:38.860
And never go to a Halloween party

04:38.930 --> 04:40.260
with a girl dressed as Robin Hood?

04:40.330 --> 04:42.600
The thing is,Jake,

04:42.660 --> 04:44.700
you wouldn't have to learn any of these lessons

04:44.760 --> 04:47.430
if you always treated women better in the first place.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.600
I'm confused. If I don't have to learn them,

04:49.660 --> 04:51.730
why are you bothering me with them?

04:56.900 --> 04:58.530
I don't know.

05:02.100 --> 05:06.360
I'm sorry to take up your valuable time.

05:06.430 --> 05:09.560
What the heck was that all about?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.600
<i>* Men. *</i>

05:17.000 --> 05:19.260
Hey. Guess what?

05:19.330 --> 05:23.900
Turns out my kid's jockstrap is too small.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.400
||Good news,eh?

05:26.460 --> 05:28.660
Yeah,terrific.

05:28.730 --> 05:30.300
Alan,let me ask you something.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.760
Do you think I'm a horrible, evil person?

05:32.830 --> 05:34.630
Yes.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.200
||What? You are.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.600
Thanks a lot.

05:38.660 --> 05:41.130
Well,you know,not intentionally evil.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.360
I mean,you know,

05:42.430 --> 05:45.230
is a tornado evi when it picks up a mobe home

05:45.300 --> 05:46.800
and flings it into an orphanage?

05:46.860 --> 05:48.760
Is a shark evil

05:48.830 --> 05:51.800
when it eats some poor schmuck on a boogie board?

05:51.860 --> 05:55.160
Is a flesh-eating virus evil when it attacks...?

05:55.230 --> 05:56.600
I get it,I get it,I get it.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.260
I'm a malevolent force of nature.

05:58.330 --> 05:59.830
Pretty much.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.960
Is this ||about what happened with Jake's old teacher today?

06:04.030 --> 06:07.100
She said that I ruined her life.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.730
Well,she did choose to sleep with you.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.760
How much of a life could she have had in the first place?

06:12.830 --> 06:15.000
Don't try to make me feel better.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.230
Because of me,the woman lost her teaching career,

06:19.300 --> 06:22.230
and now she's dancing in this skeevy club in Van Nuys

06:22.300 --> 06:23.960
and living in some fleabag motel.

06:24.030 --> 06:26.300
How do you know what club she works at?

06:26.360 --> 06:29.330
The clubs have Webites, the Web sites have pictures.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.860
It's not rocket science.

06:31.930 --> 06:35.430
Her dancing name is Desiree Bush.

06:35.500 --> 06:39.560
Certainly more colorful than Delores Pasternak.

06:39.630 --> 06:41.900
And presidential to boot.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.230
I gotta tell you, I'm feeling a little glty.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.930
Does that surprise you?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.300
No,what surprises me is the liquor isn't helping.

06:50.360 --> 06:55.760
It just beads up on the guilt and rolls right off it.

06:55.830 --> 06:58.600
Oh,come on, this can't be the first woman

06:58.660 --> 06:59.900
who had a nervous breakdown,

06:59.960 --> 07:02.400
lost her job and wound up taking her clothes off

07:02.460 --> 07:04.400
for horny strangers because of you.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.900
Of course not.

07:08.930 --> 07:11.560
But it's never bothered me before.

07:11.630 --> 07:15.560
Well,maybe you're finally

07:15.630 --> 07:17.260
developing a conscience.

07:17.330 --> 07:20.400
At long last realizing that your actions have consequences

07:20.460 --> 07:21.760
for other people.

07:21.830 --> 07:25.030
Don't talk down to m Jiny Cricket.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.400
Sorry.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.030
But you're right

07:28.100 --> 07:31.060
I do need to take responsibility for the damage I've caused.

07:31.130 --> 07:32.400
Where you going?

07:32.460 --> 07:34.660
Where else? Strip club.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.200
Wait up. I'll drive.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.860
<i>* Men. *</i>

07:41.930 --> 07:44.430
("Cherry Pie" playing)

07:47.730 --> 07:50.500
Good Lord, she's quite the gymnast.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.260
I know. I never understood why this isn't in the Olympics

07:54.330 --> 07:56.930
and synchronized diving is.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.260
Hey,honey,when's Miss Bush come out?

08:01.330 --> 08:04.060
Whenever Ben Franklin comes out.

08:04.130 --> 08:06.630
I mean Desiree Bush.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.230
She's around here somewhere.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.260
Thank you.

08:10.330 --> 08:12.730
How come she's not taking her clothes off?

08:12.800 --> 08:15.300
Because this is a bikini club.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.730
What's a bikini club?

08:16.800 --> 08:20.100
Hard liquor,no nipples.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.100
Man,I could've stayed home and seen no nipples.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.100
Hey,there she is.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.429
Miss Pasternak.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.530
What the hell are you doing here?

08:36.600 --> 08:38.159
I just wanted to talk to you.

08:38.230 --> 08:40.000
Yeah,well,I'm working, so unless you want

08:40.059 --> 08:41.799
a private dance, I got no time.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.559
I don't need a dance. Then you get los

08:43.630 --> 08:45.300
No,no,wait,wait,wait.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.460
Alan needs a dance.

08:46.530 --> 08:48.030
Oh,no,I don't,I-I...

08:48.100 --> 08:49.230
|| I'm buying.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.160
Do you mind if I take my belt off?

08:51.230 --> 08:52.900
So anyway, I just wanted to tell you

08:52.960 --> 08:56.230
that I'm really sorry for the way that I ended it,

08:56.300 --> 08:57.430
and  there's anything I can do

08:57.500 --> 08:58.730
to make it right, just let me now.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.360
(groans deeply)

09:01.430 --> 09:03.560
What can you do for me,Charlie?

09:03.630 --> 09:06.330
Well,maybe I can help you get back on your feet.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.000
Oh,oh,not yet,not yet.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.900
Are you gonna get me my house back?

09:10.960 --> 09:12.700
Are you gonna do that?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.100
Ooh,doggies!

09:16.130 --> 09:18.730
Well,no.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.800
My parents have disowned me.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.160
Are you gonna fix that relationship?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.300
I'm not real good with parents.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.600
Uh,excuse me,I've gotta, I've gotta readjust.

09:28.660 --> 09:31.260
I'm playing ring toss with my car keys.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.860
What then? Are you gonna get me my teacher's license back?

09:35.930 --> 09:37.300
I wish I could.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.530
Okay,I'm all set. We can continue.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.900
Alan,this doesn't concern you.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.530
At this point,it kinda does.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.500
Come on, hop on Pop.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.000
Thank you!

09:50.060 --> 09:52.830
lf What if there was a way for you to go back to teaching

09:52.900 --> 09:54.260
that didn't require a license?

09:54.330 --> 09:55.760
What are you talking about?

09:55.830 --> 09:58.230
Private tutoring for a special-needs child.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.930
Oh,oh,Charlie, don't drag him into this.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.460
Why not?

10:01.530 --> 10:03.430
She's a good teacher, and if his grades go any lower,

10:03.500 --> 10:06.360
we'll have to start renting him  out as a speed bump.

10:06.430 --> 10:07.860
Tutoring?

10:07.930 --> 10:09.560
Yeah,I don't know.

10:09.630 --> 10:11.560
I'll match what you're making here.

10:11.630 --> 10:15.160
Is it okay with you,Alan?

10:15.230 --> 10:16.660
Oh,yes,yes,yes!

10:19.960 --> 10:22.500
Okay,it's a deal.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.500
Oh,thank you,thank you.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.030
Now come on,teach.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.060
I'll buy you a drink and we'll toast your new career.

10:28.130 --> 10:29.530
(laughs): Great.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.060
Uh,uh... O-O-Okay.

10:32.130 --> 10:36.830
I'll,uh,I'll catch up with you guys later.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.960
Let me get this straight.

10:47.030 --> 10:49.000
She was his fifth grade teacher,

10:49.060 --> 10:51.860
and then she became a stripper because you dumped her,

10:51.930 --> 10:54.560
and now she's his tutor because you felt guilty?

10:54.630 --> 10:55.860
Pretty much.

10:55.930 --> 10:58.000
And you approved?

10:58.060 --> 11:00.500
He caught me at a weak moment.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.760
Well,who am I to judge?

11:02.830 --> 11:07.660
I almost traded one of my kids for a riding lawn mower.

11:07.730 --> 11:10.330
I'm sorry,but I'm still confused.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.200
Oh,boy.

11:12.260 --> 11:15.230
Hm. Okay,um...

11:15.300 --> 11:16.760
let's look at it this way.

11:16.830 --> 11:18.660
How about if you make $40 a dance.

11:18.730 --> 11:21.830
If you want toind out how much you can earn per hour,

11:21.900 --> 11:24.060
<i>you have to solve for xd times 40,</i>

11:24.130 --> 11:26.700
X being the number of dances you can do in an hour.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.100
What about tips?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.430
That's a variable.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.260
Oh. I get it-- so the money

11:31.330 --> 11:33.000
|| you kick back to the house is...

11:33.060 --> 11:35.500
The constant! The constant!

11:35.560 --> 11:36.530
Good for you.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.530
That's a good start.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.230
Yeah,it was. You make learng fun.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.660
(laughs): Where you going?

11:41.730 --> 11:43.230
Take a shower.

11:47.230 --> 11:49.000
Guys,we're done!

11:50.830 --> 11:52.760
Hey. So,how'd it go?

11:52.830 --> 11:54.630
Oh,a little slow.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.160
He's not exactly the quicker picker upper.

11:57.230 --> 11:58.860
Well,that's why he needs you.

11:58.930 --> 12:00.260
He's kind of an idiot.

12:00.330 --> 12:01.660
Yeah,uh,

12:01.730 --> 12:04.100
I wasn't !gonna say anything, but wow.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.500
So,we'll see you tomorrow,then?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.500
Great. Hey...

12:09.600 --> 12:11.300
! Charlie,thank you.||

12:11.360 --> 12:12.430
For what?

12:12.500 --> 12:14.600
Well,you've given me back

12:14.660 --> 12:16.930
something I lost a long time ago.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.500
I gave it back?

12:19.560 --> 12:21.500
|| How did I give it back?

12:21.560 --> 12:23.400
My self-respect.

12:23.460 --> 12:27.000
<i>Oh,sure,that you can get back.</i>

12:27.060 --> 12:30.730
And you haven't even tried to hit on me.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.230
No. And I don't intend to.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.630
I just want to see you get your life together again.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.130
Boy,I've hated you for so many years.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.560
I'm starting to think maybe I was wrong.

12:39.630 --> 12:42.200
No,no,no,you're were right-- this is new for me.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.460
Well,I like this Charlie.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.430
He's got a big heart.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.460
Thank you.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.300
Desiree,wait.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.100
Instead of going back to that motel,

12:54.160 --> 12:55.560
why don't you stay here?

12:55.630 --> 12:58.100
No strings-- just until you can get a real apartment.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.500
Where would I sleep?

12:59.560 --> 13:00.830
You can have the guest room.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.730
Well,where would Alan sleep?

13:02.800 --> 13:06.700
If there was any justice, at the bottom of a ravine.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.560
<i>* Men. *</i>

13:10.630 --> 13:12.960
I can't believe you gave her my room.

13:13.030 --> 13:16.830
<i>I can't believe you're still calling it your room.</i>

13:16.900 --> 13:19.200
How long is this gonna last?

13:19.260 --> 13:21.330
Just until she|| gets back on her feet.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.700
Oh,please, that's a load of crap.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.430
That's what I said to you six years ago.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.500
<i>You've been here six years?</i>

13:28.560 --> 13:30.900
I'll just go make up the couch.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.500
(quietly): Story of my life.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.030
No bonerS goes unpunished.

13:41.830 --> 13:44.160
<i>* Men. *</i>

13:45.700 --> 13:47.330
(door opens)

13:52.160 --> 13:53.630
Charlie.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.500
Huh?

13:56.560 --> 13:59.960
I was lying in bed alone, and I had an epiphany.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.400
Okay.

14:04.460 --> 14:08.860
It suddenly became clear to me why you came back into my life.

14:08.930 --> 14:10.400
Why?

14:11.430 --> 14:13.760
The Lord sent you.

14:13.830 --> 14:15.430
<i>The Lord?</i>

14:15.500 --> 14:19.900
Yes. He sent you to save me from my sinful ways.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.060
He did? Yes.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.360
<i>I really don't think he'd send me.</i>

14:25.430 --> 14:28.130
I'm more of a recruiter for the other side.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.760
It's not for us to question his will.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.330
Come,come,let's pray together.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.000
Now? Yes,now,while the spirit is with us.

14:35.060 --> 14:36.460
|| Can I pee first?

14:36.530 --> 14:39.300
There'll b||e plenty of time to pee in Heaven.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.360
There's peeing in Heaven?

14:41.460 --> 14:43.100
Shh!||

14:46.400 --> 14:50.060
Weird,us both being on our knees at the same time,huh?

14:50.130 --> 14:51.930
Shh!

14:52.000 --> 14:53.830
I'm just saying.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.260
<i>* Men. *</i>

14:58.300 --> 14:59.460
Morning.

14:59.530 --> 15:00.900
Morning. Morning.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.460
Morning. How'd everybody sleep?

15:02.530 --> 15:03.530
Fine. Fine.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.830
Lousy.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.660
So,listen...

15:07.730 --> 15:10.630
we might have a little problem with Miss Pasternak.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.260
Oh,Charlie,you didn't.

15:12.330 --> 15:15.130
No,I didn't. Why do you always believe the worst of me?

15:15.200 --> 15:17.200
Because you're a horrible, evil person.

15:17.260 --> 15:19.630
I thought we established that.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.860
I'll tell you what happened.

15:21.930 --> 15:23.730
Last night,I was upstairs, sleeping alone,

15:23.800 --> 15:25.130
minding my own business...

15:25.200 --> 15:27.500
Good morning,sinners.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.300
Oh,what a glorious day

15:31.360 --> 15:33.660
to bask in the forgiveness of our Lord.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.630
Uh-oh.

15:38.660 --> 15:42.300
Jake,I have wonderful news.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.160
From now on, as part of each lesson,

15:44.230 --> 15:46.330
we're gonna spend time casting demons out of you.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.500
It's the Devilh] that's making him stupid.

15:51.230 --> 15:53.630
I told you it wasn't my fault.

15:53.700 --> 15:56.460
Uh,uh,Miss Pasternak, while I'm thrilled

15:56.530 --> 15:58.460
that you're helping Jake with his schoolwork,

15:58.530 --> 16:01.000
I'm not sure an exorcism is really called for.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.760
Do you want your son to go to hell,Alan?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.460
Depends.

16:05.530 --> 16:08.430
Do they have a college prep program?

16:08.500 --> 16:11.500
Eternal damnation is no laughing matter.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.660
I know-- I've been married twice.

16:13.730 --> 16:15.700
(laughs)

16:18.000 --> 16:20.560
You think you have to wear a jockstrap in hell?

16:20.630 --> 16:23.060
Yes,but not your own.

16:23.130 --> 16:25.000
Anyway,

16:25.060 --> 16:26.760
I just came down to tell you all

16:26.830 --> 16:28.100
it's time to get dressed for church.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.030
Uh,uh,gee,

16:30.100 --> 16:31.730
uh,thanks for the iite,

16:31.800 --> 16:33.930
but,uh,Sunday is kind of our "me" day.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.300
Sunday's not a "me" day, it's a "he" day.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.830
And he will strike down the blasphemers and the disbelievers

16:40.900 --> 16:43.560
with fury and blood-soaked vengeance!

16:45.700 --> 16:49.160
So,chop-chop,washy-washy.

16:51.700 --> 16:55.060
I've said it before, and I'll say it again:

16:55.130 --> 16:57.530
Boy,can I pick 'em.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.900
Listen,I thought maybe after the service,

17:51.960 --> 17:53.160
you and I could drive around

17:53.230 --> 17:55.700
and look for a nice apartment for you.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.500
Oh,God doesn't want us to separate,Charlie.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.960

Why is your hair all wet?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.260

No,they didn't.

He managed to get himself baptized.

19:05.460 --> 19:06.600
How'd that happen?

19:06.660 --> 19:07.860
People were lining up.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.630
and gave you a white robe?

19:12.700 --> 19:15.330
I figured maybe we were getting ribs.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.930
So where's Berta?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
She took a shine to the organ player

19:21.060 --> 19:22.800
|| and stayed for the senior potluck brunch.

19:22.860 --> 19:26.030

19:26.100 --> 19:28.000
I knew I wasn't crazy.

19:29.330 --> 19:30.800
Aren't you at all concerned about

19:30.860 --> 19:32.000
what happened to Miss Pasternak?

19:32.060 --> 19:33.930
Of course I'm ||concerned.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.960
I tried to hide,didn't I?

19:36.960 --> 19:39.000
After she alized

19:39.060 --> 19:40.360
that you had dumped her yet again,

19:40.430 --> 19:41.900
she had a little bit of a meltdown.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.400
There was more tmelt?

19:44.460 --> 19:47.500
She was dripping through the cone when she left the house.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.700
She grabbed all the bills out of the collection plate

19:50.760 --> 19:52.530
and started grinding on the minister.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.630
Okay. No harm,no foul.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.500
How do you figure?

19:56.560 --> 19:58.500
That's how we found her,right?

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
Dry-humping for dollars.

20:00.630 --> 20:04.660
What happened to all your guilt about ruining her life?

20:04.730 --> 20:07.160
Oh,I still got it.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.160
I'm just learning to live with it.

20:09.230 --> 20:11.200
You're unbelievable.

20:11.260 --> 20:12.830
Oh,come on.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.260
I tried to do the right thing.

20:14.330 --> 20:15.530
My intentions were good.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.930
That's the funny thing about you.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.630
Doesn't seem to matter what your intentions are.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.460
Good,bad or indifferent,

20:22.530 --> 20:25.400
