00:55.484 --> 00:56.953
You alright?

00:57.712 --> 00:58.867
Yes.

00:59.341 --> 01:02.554
Sorry. I was being silly.

01:03.038 --> 01:06.304
I'm meeting someone. My boyfriend.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.976
Should be here any minute.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.765
A lot can happen in a minute.

01:10.974 --> 01:12.364
You should be more careful.

01:12.772 --> 01:13.906
Hey!

01:14.256 --> 01:15.884
You bothering my girlfriend?

01:16.718 --> 01:17.960
Sir.

01:18.491 --> 01:19.738
Constable Simmons.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.749
Yes, sir.

01:22.366 --> 01:24.233
Didn't expect to see you here, sir.

01:26.391 --> 01:28.046
Well, I'll leave you to it.

01:36.676 --> 01:41.676
Hey, it's OK. Come on,
pictures start in 15 minutes.

01:49.676 --> 01:52.285
I don't understand
why we're here.

01:52.378 --> 01:53.824
It's a surprise.

01:54.283 --> 01:55.895
I won't be long.

01:57.215 --> 01:58.551
Can I come in with you?

01:58.702 --> 02:02.152
No, I'll get in trouble.
But I promise it'll be worth it.

02:02.645 --> 02:05.145
I'll be right back.

02:31.056 --> 02:34.291
Ned! Are you there?

03:23.143 --> 03:24.565
Hello?

03:31.011 --> 03:32.988
What is that?

03:44.129 --> 03:45.439
Oh, hell.

03:45.716 --> 03:47.106
Ned.

03:48.826 --> 03:51.412
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Ned!

05:22.049 --> 05:25.509
Alright. Let's get to work.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.126
I just got back from Melbourne tonight.

05:32.284 --> 05:34.186
Charlie called me in when he found him.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.737
He knocked off at 6:00,
so why did he come back?

05:36.925 --> 05:38.214
I don't know.

05:38.862 --> 05:40.306
I should have been here.

05:40.636 --> 05:41.786
Where were you?

05:41.894 --> 05:43.214
I was called out.

05:43.358 --> 05:45.183
There was a disturbance
at the Royal Oak.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.910
Turned out
it was a prank call.

05:47.073 --> 05:49.116
I was only gone for an hour.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.667
You two, go and doorknock.

05:52.763 --> 05:55.792
See if anyone noticed anything
unusual earlier tonight.

06:01.971 --> 06:03.877
I have to tell his family.

06:41.598 --> 06:43.059
I'm sorry.

06:52.408 --> 06:54.666
Traces of lipstick
on the cheek.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.634
Yes.

06:58.911 --> 07:01.580
- And what's that?
- Mm?

07:01.877 --> 07:03.361
What have you found?

07:05.540 --> 07:06.970
Oh, yes.

07:07.043 --> 07:09.033
Some kind of abrasion.

07:09.666 --> 07:10.947
Fabric burn?

07:11.486 --> 07:13.798
Is that an imprint from the seam?

07:15.799 --> 07:21.916
Anyhow... spinal cord severed
between C1 and C2 vertebra.

07:22.103 --> 07:24.791
I think they've probably
grabbed him around the jaw.

07:24.947 --> 07:26.923
Which would explain this abrasion.

07:27.069 --> 07:28.869
Someone knew what they were doing.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.377
Yes.

07:34.986 --> 07:36.486
Morning, Mr Tyneman.

07:36.598 --> 07:38.752
Have you charged him yet?

07:39.337 --> 07:41.298
Your police surgeon
assaulted me!

07:41.356 --> 07:42.826
Yes, I know
who you're talking about.

07:42.884 --> 07:43.994
- Then?
- No.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.253
Why?

07:45.342 --> 07:48.002
Because one of my men
was murdered last night.

07:48.917 --> 07:51.642
Oh, put the bloody notebook away!

07:52.083 --> 07:53.981
Are there persons of
interest in this murder?

07:54.039 --> 07:55.519
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.400
The people have a right to know.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.228
No, you mean you have a right to know.

07:59.343 --> 08:00.966
Now get out of my station!

08:01.184 --> 08:02.419
I'm not sure you need any more

08:02.489 --> 08:04.270
bad publicity,
Chief Superintendent.

08:04.374 --> 08:06.309
Time to leave,
Mr Tyneman.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.955
Oh.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

08:17.021 --> 08:18.876
The attacker wore gloves.

08:19.423 --> 08:22.212
I'm guessing you haven't
found any fingerprints.

08:22.973 --> 08:24.267
They broke his neck.

08:24.447 --> 08:26.026
Yes, they did.

08:26.665 --> 08:29.368
Interview room. I'll
be with you in a moment.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.611
- Is that...?
- Ned's girlfriend.

08:33.686 --> 08:35.017
Goodness me.

08:36.788 --> 08:40.498
You know, Matthew, the sort
of injury we're talking about

08:40.556 --> 08:41.916
would have required...

08:44.176 --> 08:46.454
.. considerable force.

08:47.295 --> 08:49.947
You do know that you're
not sitting in on this?

08:50.236 --> 08:51.439
Why not?

08:51.568 --> 08:53.487
Because you stumbled
in here drunk as a lord

08:53.545 --> 08:55.578
after everyone read about your
drinking problems in the papers,

08:55.635 --> 08:57.369
you insulted me and my men

08:57.518 --> 08:59.140
and then you went out
and punched a civilian.

08:59.197 --> 09:01.146
- Oh, he...
- Don't push me, Lucien.

09:01.462 --> 09:03.022
Not today.

09:11.604 --> 09:16.901
The front door was locked,
so I waited... for ages.

09:17.096 --> 09:20.166
How long? 10 minutes? Half an hour?

09:20.283 --> 09:22.041
Half an hour, maybe.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.426
You'd just been to the pictures.

09:24.604 --> 09:26.557
Why did Ned bring you back to the station?

09:26.646 --> 09:28.246
I don't know.

09:29.449 --> 09:32.479
Did you hear anything? See anyone?

09:33.035 --> 09:34.089
No.

09:34.542 --> 09:37.454
So you got tired of waiting and left.

09:37.821 --> 09:39.220
Is that right?

09:41.986 --> 09:43.228
Amy?

09:43.672 --> 09:45.127
Did you walk home?

09:45.907 --> 09:47.689
I got a lift.

09:50.202 --> 09:51.502
Who from?

09:51.706 --> 09:52.940
I don't know his name.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.096
Well, how did he know
you needed a lift?

09:55.237 --> 09:57.541
He drove past.

09:59.581 --> 10:01.110
We'd like to talk to him.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.735
I don't know where he is.

11:01.718 --> 11:03.188
Are you alright?

11:03.639 --> 11:05.116
Are you?

11:06.486 --> 11:08.712
I saw the news and...

11:09.027 --> 11:11.027
I thought that...

11:13.681 --> 11:15.204
What happened?

11:20.534 --> 11:21.534
I don't work

11:21.592 --> 11:22.973
for the paper anymore, if that's
what you're worried about.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.230
No, I know that.
It's just...

11:27.717 --> 11:30.157
One of our men is dead.

11:32.269 --> 11:34.074
I should have been here.

11:37.062 --> 11:38.332
I'm sorry.

11:38.605 --> 11:39.707
I am.

11:39.847 --> 11:41.910
It's really terrible and I'm just...

11:44.278 --> 11:46.207
I'll go. You must be frantic.

11:50.019 --> 11:51.754
What would they want
with these files?

11:52.058 --> 11:53.457
I don't know, Bill.

11:53.515 --> 11:55.504
Perhaps
they were looking for something.

11:56.070 --> 11:57.990
Nothing standing out so far.

12:01.094 --> 12:03.176
- Sir.
- Your Chief Superintendent.

12:03.234 --> 12:04.394
Tell him I want to see him.

12:04.459 --> 12:06.162
He's in a meeting right now.
I'm sorry.

12:06.223 --> 12:07.418
Then get him out!

12:07.496 --> 12:10.058
Well, he won't be much
longer. Why don't you wait...

12:11.636 --> 12:12.902
William.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.676
William!

12:22.644 --> 12:23.680
Munro!

12:23.738 --> 12:26.465
How are you even allowed
back into that station?

12:26.656 --> 12:28.046
Everyone knows what you are.

12:28.118 --> 12:29.926
Really? And what's that?

12:30.004 --> 12:33.441
A drunk...
with no regard for rules,

12:33.532 --> 12:34.972
no respect for authority.

12:35.057 --> 12:36.287
What are you doing here?

12:36.948 --> 12:39.832
Tell your Chief Superintendent
I'll talk to him.

12:40.246 --> 12:41.879
Fine, I'll tell him that.

12:42.116 --> 12:44.363
And when he's finished
dealing with

12:44.421 --> 12:46.026
the murder of one of
his own men, who knows?

12:46.083 --> 12:47.646
- Perhaps he'll speak...
- I saw him.

12:48.591 --> 12:49.795
Simmons.

12:50.156 --> 12:51.365
Last night.

12:51.446 --> 12:54.021
He was with some young thing.
They were being followed.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.721
You'd better come back
inside.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.372
I don't have to do anything you say.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.673
No, you don't.

13:01.796 --> 13:03.478
But an officer is dead.

13:03.635 --> 13:05.924
Then God help him if you're on the case.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.160
He said
he saw Ned last night.

13:12.197 --> 13:14.027
What are you thinking,
Doc?

13:14.471 --> 13:17.963
Oh, it's just... the timing of it all.

13:18.021 --> 13:19.454
Munro back in town...

13:19.527 --> 13:21.077
You're not saying he attacked Ned?

13:21.227 --> 13:22.588
I don't know.

13:22.713 --> 13:25.150
When was Ned going to front
the corruption inquiry?

13:25.364 --> 13:27.830
Uh... next week.

13:28.603 --> 13:30.008
When Ned worked at St Kilda,

13:30.112 --> 13:31.618
this dodgy bloke would
show up

13:31.676 --> 13:33.135
with a brown paper bag
full of cash

13:33.193 --> 13:34.560
- every couple of weeks.
- Yeah, yeah...

13:34.617 --> 13:36.466
a bloke named
Walter Gregan.

13:36.632 --> 13:38.633
Munro was senior officer
at the time

13:38.691 --> 13:39.977
and now he's on suspension,

13:40.035 --> 13:41.789
pending the outcome of the inquiry.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.844
Go and find Munro and have a chat.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.485
Will do, boss.

13:50.054 --> 13:51.974
You're sending him out with no backup?

13:54.555 --> 13:56.149
I'll behave.

13:56.742 --> 13:58.196
Mm. You'd better.

14:14.768 --> 14:16.048
Charlie?

14:18.093 --> 14:20.008
- Let me do the talking.
- Yes.

14:31.823 --> 14:33.183
Mr Munro.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.209
Why is he here?

14:36.752 --> 14:38.799
You told the doctor that
Ned's girlfriend

14:38.857 --> 14:40.727
was being followed yesterday.

14:41.612 --> 14:42.823
What'd you see?

14:42.881 --> 14:44.394
Simmons and his girl.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.516
There was a man following her.

14:48.116 --> 14:50.026
I stepped in and he left.

14:50.721 --> 14:52.106
Any idea who?

14:53.522 --> 14:55.065
Walter Gregan.

14:56.507 --> 14:58.380
As I'm sure you both know,

14:58.815 --> 15:02.299
Simmons was fronting the inquiry
with evidence about Gregan.

15:02.916 --> 15:04.198
Now he's dead.

15:04.296 --> 15:09.245
Ned's evidence may also
have implicated you, William.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.908
This an official interview?

15:14.178 --> 15:16.104
Is there anything else you can tell us?

15:17.262 --> 15:19.932
He was driving a Falcon. Light grey.

15:21.345 --> 15:24.791
He has priors for break and
enter, possession of firearms,

15:24.924 --> 15:26.346
threats to gain advantage.

15:26.633 --> 15:28.995
Right. Well, thank you.

15:29.635 --> 15:31.424
So what do you have so far?

15:34.321 --> 15:36.823
You're not going to tell me
because I'm not on active duty?

15:37.208 --> 15:38.691
Thanks for your time.

15:49.856 --> 15:51.682
Oh, Sergeant?

15:52.401 --> 15:53.666
Mrs Bentley.

15:53.916 --> 15:55.166
You can call me Billie.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.635
And how long can we
expect to be enjoying

15:57.693 --> 15:59.268
the company of
our good mate in there?

15:59.326 --> 16:00.402
Is there a problem?

16:00.514 --> 16:01.867
It's causing some friction.

16:02.047 --> 16:04.002
Copper takes up residence
at the end of the bar.

16:04.069 --> 16:05.331
It's upsetting my regulars.

16:05.389 --> 16:07.379
Well, he's not a serving
policeman anymore, so...

16:07.522 --> 16:10.271
Mm... in my experience,
that doesn't make much difference.

16:10.389 --> 16:11.959
There's not much we can do,
I'm afraid.

16:12.147 --> 16:14.303
Well, I suggest that
you think of something

16:14.361 --> 16:17.014
before someone takes matters
into their own hands.

16:17.334 --> 16:20.221
Mrs Bentley, he's having a
drink in a public place.

16:20.279 --> 16:23.904
And yesterday, he asked my
barman if he could find him a gun.

16:26.833 --> 16:27.951
Excuse me.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.200
Thought so.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.460
Thank you, Charlie.

16:46.743 --> 16:48.853
I heard his family
left him.

16:49.328 --> 16:50.958
- Is that right?
- Mm.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.853
You think he blames us?

16:52.911 --> 16:54.471
I think he blames me.

16:55.816 --> 16:58.126
I cannot believe they
kept him on the force.

16:58.478 --> 17:00.251
Friends in high places, obviously.

17:00.309 --> 17:03.392
Charlie,
that woman, Mrs Bentley.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.723
You trust her?

17:04.827 --> 17:08.431
No. This is where
I was called out to last night.

17:08.680 --> 17:12.118
- Ah, the infamous prank call.
- Mm.

17:13.556 --> 17:15.321
It does happen,
I suppose.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.986
According to Munro, the man
trailing Ned was Walter Gregan,

17:21.095 --> 17:23.765
the same bloke he was giving
evidence against. Over.

17:23.992 --> 17:25.415
Right, we'll get onto it.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.180
What does Munro need a gun for? Over.

17:28.430 --> 17:29.731
No idea, boss.

17:29.790 --> 17:32.790
We'll call by the gun shops,
then head back to the station. Out.

17:42.967 --> 17:44.533
- Hello, Patrick.
- Jean.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.447
Have you got a moment?

17:47.682 --> 17:49.125
Of course.

17:55.150 --> 17:57.408
I just want you to know that, uh...

17:58.792 --> 18:02.145
.. none of that appalling
article came from me.

18:02.517 --> 18:05.396
- I know. It's alright, Patrick.
- No, no, no.

18:05.871 --> 18:09.205
My son named you in that
article. It's not alright.

18:10.345 --> 18:13.517
And I've also heard what's
been happening at the church.

18:13.768 --> 18:16.118
Well, I've put Father Emery in
rather a difficult position.

18:16.176 --> 18:17.541
Oh, that's ridiculous.

18:17.599 --> 18:19.082
No, it's canon law.

18:21.728 --> 18:26.306
Look, Jean, I... I don't want
to sound like the voice of doom,

18:26.433 --> 18:30.025
but... you do know
I-I mean, you-you understand

18:30.783 --> 18:33.533
there'll be more articles,
more gossip.

18:34.283 --> 18:35.955
There will be more.

18:36.016 --> 18:38.206
From your son?
Your newspaper?

18:39.886 --> 18:41.346
My son...

18:43.510 --> 18:46.994
.. continues to be
a huge disappointment.

18:53.331 --> 18:56.595
- I didn't come here for sympathy.
- I know that, Patrick.

18:57.557 --> 18:59.077
Thanks for the tea.

19:00.589 --> 19:02.712
Tell Lucien that, uh,

19:03.743 --> 19:07.166
I successfully managed
to avoid his company.

19:08.996 --> 19:12.516
And again,
please accept my apologies.

19:17.052 --> 19:18.485
What about Munro?

19:19.080 --> 19:21.533
He made himself scarce
after we talked to him.

19:21.796 --> 19:23.689
And nothing from the gun shops.

19:23.822 --> 19:26.775
Stott hasn't seen him and the Gun
Emporium's closed down, so...

19:26.853 --> 19:29.158
If he's serious about getting
a gun, he'll find one.

19:29.216 --> 19:31.134
And, Matthew,
do you think all this business,

19:31.193 --> 19:34.166
turning the place upside down,
was done to confuse us?

19:34.224 --> 19:35.236
Confuse us how?

19:35.294 --> 19:38.294
Well, to make it seem like
it was about something in the files

19:38.352 --> 19:39.458
when it's not.

19:39.516 --> 19:41.069
Boss, we've found Gregan.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.474
Right. He's dangerous,
possibly armed.

19:45.288 --> 19:47.048
Boss, look at this.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.333
And there's a weapon
missing. Your gun, boss.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.713
Bloody hell.
Be prepared for anything.

20:18.625 --> 20:21.204
Hey! Back inside!

20:35.388 --> 20:38.686
Mr Gregan, this is the
police! Open the door, please!

20:44.808 --> 20:48.006
Police! Open the door,
Mr Gregan, now!

20:53.806 --> 20:55.131
Police! Don't move!

20:56.152 --> 20:57.542
Morning, boys.

20:57.801 --> 20:59.077
Big entrance.

20:59.196 --> 21:01.139
Hands where I cam see them,
Mr Gregan.

21:01.274 --> 21:03.271
You worried I'm holding
a loaded weapon?

21:04.089 --> 21:05.159
I'm flattered.

21:05.309 --> 21:06.928
Hands. Now!

21:11.837 --> 21:14.117
Out of bed. Slowly.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.723
If you insist.

21:22.117 --> 21:24.967
Not really anywhere to
hide a gun, is there?

21:26.639 --> 21:28.881
Ned Simmons...

21:30.402 --> 21:33.312
He witnessed you offering
cash bribes to senior officers

21:33.415 --> 21:34.808
at St Kilda police station.

21:35.373 --> 21:36.749
Never heard of him.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.506
He was also
Amy Kingham's boyfriend.

21:40.014 --> 21:41.029
Who?

21:41.178 --> 21:42.764
The woman you followed.

21:43.639 --> 21:44.946
Don't know her.

21:45.248 --> 21:47.014
Walter's just a friend.

21:47.132 --> 21:48.607
Your boyfriend.

21:48.944 --> 21:53.795
No! He used to be.
It's... just...

21:54.721 --> 21:55.954
What?

21:56.318 --> 21:57.531
Nothing.

21:58.301 --> 22:00.291
Was he the friend who
picked you up last night

22:00.425 --> 22:02.225
when you were waiting outside
the station?

22:02.953 --> 22:05.663
Does the name William
Munro mean anything to you?

22:06.264 --> 22:07.469
Maybe.

22:07.803 --> 22:08.989
Hard to say.

22:09.083 --> 22:11.873
He was also at St Kilda when you
were handing out cash bribes.

22:11.953 --> 22:13.389
Anyone see me?

22:13.447 --> 22:17.287
Oh, that Simmons bloke.

22:17.426 --> 22:19.732
That Simmons bloke was going
to give evidence against you.

22:19.861 --> 22:22.134
Like I said,
I've never heard of him.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.139
Well, he'd heard of you.

22:24.536 --> 22:27.656
Maybe Amy whispered
my name in her sleep.

22:28.192 --> 22:29.928
I just want to go home.

22:30.092 --> 22:31.107
No.

22:31.194 --> 22:32.434
Why not?

22:33.391 --> 22:35.664
Because your boyfriend
is in the interview room

22:35.735 --> 22:37.343
answering questions
about whether or not...

22:37.400 --> 22:39.511
- Walter is not my boyfriend!
- .. he killed one of my colleagues!

22:39.568 --> 22:42.256
So no!
You don't get to go home.

22:43.718 --> 22:46.998
Did Walter Gregan ever
mention Ned's name to you?

22:48.168 --> 22:49.818
I'm sorry.

22:50.631 --> 22:52.771
What does that mean, Amy?

22:53.266 --> 22:56.701
I'd like my car keys returned
and I'd like to leave now.

22:58.630 --> 23:00.975
Your car has been impounded
until further notice.

23:01.033 --> 23:02.116
On what grounds?

23:02.174 --> 23:04.804
On the grounds that you're a
suspect in a murder investigation,

23:05.076 --> 23:07.576
and we're entitled
to search your vehicle.

23:12.092 --> 23:14.045
I'm bored now.

23:15.226 --> 23:18.546
Anything else you want to say,
you can talk to my solicitor.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.081
Good.

23:22.107 --> 23:24.771
You can make that call
on the way to the cells.

23:50.556 --> 23:52.118
Please, I just want to go home.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.485
Take her through, Davis.

23:53.543 --> 23:55.079
Charlie. Matthew.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.546
Miss Kingham, tell me,

23:59.962 --> 24:01.181
how was Ned

24:01.524 --> 24:03.204
when he left you
outside the station?

24:03.276 --> 24:04.696
How did he seem to you?

24:04.813 --> 24:05.907
Amy.

24:06.115 --> 24:07.585
What's going on?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.603
He was happy.

24:10.168 --> 24:13.407
Yes. Yes, I'm sure he was.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.735
Because he was going
to give you this.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.360
He loved you, didn't he?

24:20.540 --> 24:23.316
Oh, no. They're playing you, baby.
Don't let 'em do it.

24:24.381 --> 24:26.220
He was going to ask you to marry him.

24:26.329 --> 24:27.329
Amy, don't.

24:27.643 --> 24:28.966
I loved him.

24:30.167 --> 24:31.960
I loved him.

24:32.163 --> 24:34.641
But Walter wouldn't
leave me alone.

24:34.748 --> 24:36.664
He kept at me and at me,

24:36.735 --> 24:38.438
followed me around in his car,

24:38.734 --> 24:41.094
asking about Ned, saying
he wanted me back.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.146
- Amy, shut your mouth!
- Get him out of here!

24:43.204 --> 24:45.216
He said he'd hurt Ned if I didn't
get him to lie about the bribes.

24:45.273 --> 24:47.546
- Hey!
- Bill! Bloody hell.

24:47.633 --> 24:48.756
Bill.

25:10.983 --> 25:13.069
'Be advised that the
suspect, Walter Gregan,

25:13.127 --> 25:14.141
is still at large.

25:14.219 --> 25:17.436
Officers are to use any force
necessary to apprehend. Over.

25:18.546 --> 25:19.739
How's Bill?

25:19.811 --> 25:22.233
Well, he insists he's fine,
of course,

25:22.313 --> 25:24.063
but I tell you,
it was a hell of a knock.

25:24.276 --> 25:25.549
What about the girl?

25:26.107 --> 25:28.643
The girl, yes. Well...

25:30.519 --> 25:34.312
.. she's rather shaken
and very sorry.

25:34.414 --> 25:36.014
So she should be.

25:36.897 --> 25:41.084
Anyhow, it makes no sense to
me that someone like Gregan,

25:41.196 --> 25:45.131
with all his contacts, would break
into a police station to steal a gun

25:45.189 --> 25:47.022
when he could get one
anywhere.

25:47.257 --> 25:50.053
Look,
someone made that emergency call.

25:50.156 --> 25:52.334
They knew
the station would be unmanned.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.599
However, they had no
way of knowing

25:54.741 --> 25:56.731
that Ned would come back
for that engagement ring.

25:56.795 --> 25:57.831
I think...

25:57.996 --> 26:00.029
.. I think they came for the gun.

26:00.475 --> 26:03.264
And Ned stumbled across the
intruder and was killed.

26:03.393 --> 26:07.066
Yes. Now, William Munro
was looking for a gun...

26:07.124 --> 26:08.128
Hear me out.

26:08.232 --> 26:09.842
He knows police procedure...

26:10.530 --> 26:12.295
Chief Superintendent Lawson.

26:15.301 --> 26:16.701
Yes, sir.

26:23.090 --> 26:24.850
Matthew, what's going on?

26:27.017 --> 26:29.373
We don't have to do this
in front of everyone else.

26:29.639 --> 26:30.996
Do what?

26:32.471 --> 26:35.104
As officer in charge of this
station, I'm obliged to inform you

26:35.162 --> 26:37.682
that your position as police
surgeon has been terminated

26:37.916 --> 26:40.396
and I'm to notify you
as to the reasons.

26:41.657 --> 26:45.065
Drinking while on duty, endangering
yourself and your colleagues...

26:45.123 --> 26:45.963
It's alright, Matthew.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.084
.. coupled with
your public notoriety...

26:49.116 --> 26:52.744
.. has meant that it's cast a very
unfavourable light on the force

26:52.802 --> 26:54.127
and made your job untenable.

26:54.251 --> 26:55.734
Do you understand?

26:57.476 --> 26:59.463
Please answer yes or no.

27:01.223 --> 27:02.432
Yes.

27:03.621 --> 27:05.141
You have anything else to say?

27:06.051 --> 27:08.526
They didn't leave you
any option, did they?

27:09.833 --> 27:12.193
You didn't leave them any option,
Lucien.

27:56.937 --> 27:58.140
Hello.

27:59.328 --> 28:00.626
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:00.742 --> 28:01.840
My fault.

28:01.968 --> 28:04.116
Oh, Superintendent Munro.

28:04.765 --> 28:08.175
I'm Jean Beazley.
I worked for Dr Lucien Blake.

28:08.238 --> 28:11.281
Yes. The housekeeper.

28:12.623 --> 28:14.898
Well, we're engaged now,
actually.

28:17.695 --> 28:19.555
Well, I suppose that
I should say congratulations.

28:19.612 --> 28:20.695
Thank you.

28:20.753 --> 28:24.873
But I am sorry to say that
I foresee a difficult future for you.

28:27.036 --> 28:28.636
Good day, Mrs Beazley.

28:44.607 --> 28:47.157
- Good to see you, Cec, as always.
- And you, sir.

28:47.299 --> 28:50.012
- Shall I get your usual, sir?
- Thank you, yes.

28:50.122 --> 28:52.838
And whatever Mr Munro's having.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.256
Of course, sir.

28:54.397 --> 28:56.557
And, Cec, in case I forget...

28:57.596 --> 29:00.072
.. have a very merry Christmas,
won't you, my dear friend?

29:00.130 --> 29:02.635
Oh, thank you, sir,
I will. Thank you.

29:09.293 --> 29:10.697
Hello, William.

29:11.670 --> 29:13.385
Please, I'm not here for an argument.

29:13.470 --> 29:14.833
Why are you here, then?

29:16.831 --> 29:18.822
Accuse me of killing Simmons?

29:20.174 --> 29:21.760
I know how you think.

29:23.307 --> 29:24.627
Well, then.

29:26.836 --> 29:28.676
Take me through the evidence.

29:31.393 --> 29:32.712
Alright.

29:33.837 --> 29:36.744
You were the last person
to see Ned Simmons alive,

29:36.869 --> 29:38.151
apart from his girlfriend.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.991
Circumstantial.
You know that.

29:40.110 --> 29:42.244
Well, you could have
followed him to the station.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.175
Perhaps even arrived there
before him.

29:44.372 --> 29:45.735
What's my motive?

29:46.856 --> 29:48.886
The evidence he was about
to give at the inquiry

29:48.944 --> 29:52.667
was going to reflect badly on you.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.416
- Fingerprints?
- No.

29:57.519 --> 30:02.512
Whoever killed him took certain
measures to avoid detection.

30:02.615 --> 30:05.197
Any fool who reads novels
knows to wear gloves.

30:05.340 --> 30:08.896
Stole a particular item,
suggesting inside knowledge.

30:09.046 --> 30:11.416
Now, did you ever hand
in your station keys?

30:11.488 --> 30:13.801
A good detective
shouldn't ask a question

30:13.859 --> 30:15.339
he doesn't know the answer to.

30:16.919 --> 30:19.049
- Cec, thank you.
- Sir.

30:26.596 --> 30:27.876
Did you?

30:29.053 --> 30:30.453
No.

30:31.385 --> 30:33.585
What do you need a gun for, William?

30:36.165 --> 30:37.925
This is a dangerous town.

30:39.436 --> 30:40.971
Haven't you noticed?

30:42.476 --> 30:44.716
Why did you come back here, William?

30:45.900 --> 30:48.643
Well, I could say it was
for redemptive purposes.

30:50.716 --> 30:51.916
Or perhaps it was simply

30:51.974 --> 30:54.690
that I read the article
about you in the newspaper

30:54.877 --> 30:56.827
and wanted to witness
your fall from grace.

30:56.914 --> 31:00.317
After my own,
I find them quite fascinating.

31:02.116 --> 31:03.604
No.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.744
No, no, that... that
doesn't sound like you.

31:09.199 --> 31:11.440
I know we had our differences, William.

31:13.103 --> 31:17.612
But we both know I was
only ever doing my job.

31:17.756 --> 31:20.226
Well, that's not entirely
true, though, is it?

31:20.666 --> 31:25.627
Your job is to inspect crime
scenes, perform autopsies,

31:25.718 --> 31:27.026
fill out death certificates.

31:27.084 --> 31:28.088
That's it.

31:28.146 --> 31:30.721
- But, William, I need...
- You do what you do...

31:33.128 --> 31:34.448
.. because you have to.

31:36.375 --> 31:38.415
Believe it or not, I understand that.

31:43.542 --> 31:46.362
We're two sides of the same coin, Blake.

31:52.919 --> 31:54.783
Why are you here, William?

31:56.276 --> 31:58.236
Because I've become expendable.

32:01.076 --> 32:03.346
That offends my sense of justice.

33:18.628 --> 33:19.792
Blake, get down!

33:30.316 --> 33:31.676
Oh, William!

33:32.796 --> 33:34.029
William!

33:34.116 --> 33:36.149
- Dear God.
- Oh...

33:36.236 --> 33:37.796
Now, you listen to me.

33:38.567 --> 33:41.717
Listen, you're going to be fine,
alright? You're going to be fine.

33:41.953 --> 33:43.246
The truth, Blake.

33:44.067 --> 33:45.512
You hang on.

33:45.874 --> 33:48.514
Someone call an ambulance,
for God's sake!

33:51.062 --> 33:53.239
You're not going anywhere,
do you understand me?

33:53.422 --> 33:55.090
You're not going anywhere.

33:56.351 --> 33:57.746
You saved my life.

33:59.607 --> 34:01.981
It's... it's my job.

34:04.238 --> 34:06.129
William, hold on.

34:06.322 --> 34:09.012
William, you stay with me,
do you understand?

34:12.766 --> 34:13.967
William!

34:20.045 --> 34:23.166
Munro's family,
anyone spoken with them?

34:24.543 --> 34:26.621
- The driver.
- We're onto it.

34:27.956 --> 34:30.340
Munro was killed outside
The Royal Oak.

34:30.465 --> 34:31.995
Perhaps there's a connection.

34:32.121 --> 34:34.509
Charlie being there the night
Ned was killed.

34:34.596 --> 34:37.027
It's looking like
Gregan's our best bet.

34:38.281 --> 34:40.154
Matthew, the autopsy. I...

34:40.257 --> 34:43.127
Given that I've sacked you,
there's no way that you can officiate.

34:43.300 --> 34:44.887
I will assist Dr Harvey.

34:44.945 --> 34:46.110
The paperwork will reflect

34:46.168 --> 34:47.600
that there were just
the two of us in there.

34:47.657 --> 34:48.668
Of course.

34:49.072 --> 34:50.716
You can observe.

34:55.667 --> 34:59.957
Single bullet wound to the chest.
No exit wound.

35:06.176 --> 35:07.551
There's no need to watch

35:07.609 --> 35:09.770
if you find this distressing,
Chief Superintendent.

35:10.134 --> 35:11.697
I'm not squeamish.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.034
Got you.

35:26.289 --> 35:28.206
Could that have come
from a service revolver?

35:28.336 --> 35:30.682
- It most certainly could have, yes.
- Dr Harvey?

35:31.088 --> 35:34.346
It's consistent with a
0.32 calibre handgun, yes.

35:51.062 --> 35:53.784
I'm afraid I never cared
for him very much.

35:54.729 --> 35:59.129
No. But he saved my life.

36:06.354 --> 36:09.916
Why was William Munro
going back to your pub?

36:11.727 --> 36:13.588
Perhaps he liked the beer.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.979
He did spend
quite a bit of time there.

36:16.121 --> 36:18.049
He died there too.

36:19.958 --> 36:24.120
Are you aware of any threats
against him? Anyone he met with?

36:24.259 --> 36:26.354
He had words with a few people.

36:26.511 --> 36:28.781
He was asking about
that dead boy of yours.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.627
Was Walter Gregan one of them?

36:30.731 --> 36:32.815
Who? I wouldn't know.

36:32.959 --> 36:34.956
Did he meet with Walter Gregan?

36:35.727 --> 36:37.549
I answered your question.

36:37.734 --> 36:40.073
You didn't like Mr Munro, did you?

36:40.258 --> 36:42.088
Well, he was a copper.

36:42.690 --> 36:45.299
Who shut you down
for licence violations

36:45.357 --> 36:47.268
when he was in charge here.

36:47.709 --> 36:50.209
You were running girls
out of your establishment.

36:50.705 --> 36:53.424
That's all water under
the bridge, Matthew.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.221
Two nights ago,
I was called out to your pub.

36:56.315 --> 36:59.831
And my husband told you
it wasn't us who called for you.

37:00.835 --> 37:02.905
But it got him out of the station.

37:03.242 --> 37:04.875
And where were you?

37:04.933 --> 37:06.010
In bed.

37:06.114 --> 37:07.815
Can anyone vouch for that?

37:10.957 --> 37:12.190
Moving on.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.866
Ned Simmons.

37:13.953 --> 37:15.189
And?

37:15.276 --> 37:16.854
Well, I talked to his mother.

37:17.043 --> 37:18.993
Apparently you loaned him
some money.

37:19.573 --> 37:22.174
For an engagement ring.
Romantic.

37:22.377 --> 37:24.268
Not very, when you
raised the interest rate

37:24.326 --> 37:26.126
and threatened him for
repayments.

37:27.106 --> 37:29.284
He was late paying you back,
wasn't he?

37:30.839 --> 37:34.272
You have lost two colleagues,
Matthew, and I am sorry.

37:34.713 --> 37:38.502
But if you don't want to charge me,
then I might get back to work.

37:38.885 --> 37:41.596
And a lift would be appreciated.

37:49.421 --> 37:51.690
This'll be close enough,
thanks, Sergeant.

37:58.462 --> 38:00.118
You got a girlfriend, love?

38:01.219 --> 38:04.313
There's a couple of nice girls
in at the bar if you're keen.

38:08.693 --> 38:12.376
When Mr Munro was asking
about that dead boy of yours,

38:12.434 --> 38:16.704
you might like to know he was writing
things down in his little notebook.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.390
So why are you telling me this now?

38:19.618 --> 38:21.371
Because I'm doing you a favour.

38:21.837 --> 38:24.532
And favours are a nice
thing to do for people.

38:24.633 --> 38:25.946
Don't you think?

38:27.796 --> 38:30.716
So did Mr Munro meet
with Walter Gregan, then?

38:32.402 --> 38:34.821
I have a weakness for a pretty face.

38:35.988 --> 38:38.727
But pretty faces don't last.

38:39.632 --> 38:42.220
If I start dobbing on all
my patrons to the coppers,

38:42.337 --> 38:44.820
well, who's going to trust me then?

38:50.756 --> 38:52.516
Thanks for the ride.

38:57.396 --> 39:00.056
Munro was asking questions
about Ned.

39:00.493 --> 39:04.571
Also apparently he was writing
things down in a notebook. Over.

39:05.188 --> 39:08.149
Well, head to the morgue and
see if you can find it. Over.

39:08.314 --> 39:12.107
Will do. Any luck locating Gregan? Over.

39:12.273 --> 39:14.596
No, nothing yet. Out.

39:27.843 --> 39:31.376
- Good morning, Jean.
- Oh... Father.

39:33.821 --> 39:38.524
I must say, the flowers are
absolutely beautiful this year.

39:38.582 --> 39:40.452
Oh, so glad you've noticed.

39:40.603 --> 39:42.046
I always do.

39:45.700 --> 39:48.060
Father, I'm leaving.

39:51.272 --> 39:52.742
You should seriously reconsider.

39:52.813 --> 39:54.766
This is not a decision
to take lightly.

39:54.877 --> 39:58.350
I can assure you, I have not
taken this decision lightly.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.506
But this is your church, Jean.

40:00.876 --> 40:04.790
Yes... I was baptised here.

40:05.773 --> 40:07.653
I was married here.

40:10.356 --> 40:12.716
My two sons were baptised here.

40:15.381 --> 40:18.221
But it won't see me
married again, will it?

40:21.196 --> 40:22.384
No.

40:27.727 --> 40:29.874
Then it's not my church anymore.

40:38.726 --> 40:39.966
Thank you.

40:44.435 --> 40:45.915
Goodbye, Jean.

41:01.596 --> 41:04.501
Ballarat Police Station,
Chief Superintendent Lawson.

41:05.759 --> 41:07.216
Well, no...

41:07.313 --> 41:10.532
Look, no, no,
that's not a good idea, no.

41:11.464 --> 41:13.243
Sergeant, arm up. Get me a weapon.

41:13.391 --> 41:16.098
No, listen, just leave it
with us. We're on our way.

41:16.404 --> 41:17.437
Hello?

41:17.712 --> 41:18.956
Hello?

41:22.745 --> 41:24.204
Get the car.

41:25.185 --> 41:26.548
Move it!

41:37.429 --> 41:41.751
Hey. I knew you'd come back, baby.

41:43.143 --> 41:44.983
I didn't come back for you.

41:52.716 --> 41:54.236
Get down!

42:01.236 --> 42:03.105
That was a stupid thing to do.

42:03.476 --> 42:05.396
You could have got yourself killed.

42:06.605 --> 42:08.246
I did it for Ned.

42:13.076 --> 42:15.222
Amy!

42:52.836 --> 42:54.242
It's not shorthand.

42:54.354 --> 42:56.587
It's as if Munro has
his own kind of code.

42:56.815 --> 42:58.845
There's nothing here you can decipher?

42:59.073 --> 43:02.026
Only what you can.
Dates, numbers.

43:02.494 --> 43:03.494
Right.

43:04.437 --> 43:06.636
Well, the letter G...

43:07.673 --> 43:09.164
.. I'm thinking is Gregan.

43:09.945 --> 43:13.789
But, look,
toward the end, it's all B.

43:14.234 --> 43:16.306
B, B, B, B, B. It's all Bs.

43:16.453 --> 43:17.804
Which makes me think,

43:18.067 --> 43:21.217
given that Munro spent so
much time at the Royal Oaks,

43:21.593 --> 43:26.570
B is for Mrs Bentley,
the publican, hmm?

43:26.836 --> 43:29.804
Hm. What about these numbers here?

43:30.011 --> 43:33.953
41-49, 40-60.

43:34.036 --> 43:35.746
Are they odds of some description?

43:36.234 --> 43:40.039
Neither of them have a history
of gambling, as far as I know.

43:40.636 --> 43:42.156
Let me just get that, Rose.

43:45.329 --> 43:47.000
Yes. Dr Lucien...

43:47.116 --> 43:51.273
Matthew. No, I'm here.
I'm just... I found Munro's...

43:52.320 --> 43:53.867
Is he alright?

43:54.632 --> 43:56.000
Where?

43:57.775 --> 43:59.205
Yes, of course I will.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.229
No, no, no, no, you go.

44:01.316 --> 44:02.676
We'll speak later.

44:05.756 --> 44:07.836
Rose, it's Charlie. He's alright.

44:08.577 --> 44:10.109
He's been injured.

44:11.009 --> 44:12.773
Someone attacked him
at the morgue.

44:12.873 --> 44:14.029
What? How?

44:14.116 --> 44:15.349
I don't know.

44:15.428 --> 44:17.588
He's safe, that's the main thing.

44:18.505 --> 44:21.135
Someone is attacking police.
Someone with a grudge.

44:21.221 --> 44:23.224
Someone who blames them
for something.

44:25.139 --> 44:27.889
But why didn't they kill him
when they had the chance?

44:28.523 --> 44:33.250
And why would they assume
he would be at the morgue?

44:34.171 --> 44:35.367
Now, whoever this is,

44:35.425 --> 44:37.836
they're managing to stay
one step ahead of us.

44:45.118 --> 44:47.625
They're listening in
to the police radio.

44:49.029 --> 44:53.466
Uh, may I... um...
These numbers.

44:53.740 --> 44:57.857
41-49... let's say 1941, 1949,

44:57.915 --> 45:01.561
and 40-60, let's say 1940 and '60.

45:01.619 --> 45:04.842
That's... that's eight years.

45:05.377 --> 45:06.756
20 years.

45:08.021 --> 45:10.956
Eight years, 20 years. B.

45:16.022 --> 45:19.171
It's not the police they have
a grudge against, it's me.

45:20.814 --> 45:22.854
He's a good man, Christopher.

45:24.156 --> 45:25.694
He's a bit...

45:26.676 --> 45:29.632
.. well, he's complicated,
but he's a very good man.

45:30.779 --> 45:32.099
You'd like him.

45:32.993 --> 45:35.793
Well, maybe you wouldn't like him,
but you'd understand him.

45:38.075 --> 45:40.194
I loved you so much.

45:42.156 --> 45:45.710
And I'm sorry if you ever thought
that you weren't enough for me.

45:47.709 --> 45:49.991
You actually meant everything to me.

45:52.664 --> 45:55.585
But I have to start
to live my life again.

45:57.436 --> 45:59.085
Mrs Beazley.

46:01.127 --> 46:03.007
I'm sorry, do I know you?

46:33.305 --> 46:34.585
Jean!

46:35.754 --> 46:36.954
Blake.

46:38.071 --> 46:39.344
Finally!

46:39.556 --> 46:42.256
I was beginning to question
how clever you really are.

46:42.796 --> 46:46.227
Jean and I were just
visiting my daughters here.

46:48.007 --> 46:49.321
Mr Baker...

46:49.448 --> 46:52.367
Norman, please, let her go.

46:56.854 --> 46:58.444
Everything's going to be alright.

46:58.523 --> 46:59.639
Yes.

46:59.883 --> 47:01.906
That's what you tell people,
don't you?

47:02.084 --> 47:04.946
It's... What is it?
It's... bedside manner.

47:06.302 --> 47:08.815
But not this time.

47:09.164 --> 47:10.969
Norman, I understand your distress.

47:11.052 --> 47:14.008
No, Doctor... you really don't.

47:14.066 --> 47:15.172
You go. You go.

47:15.230 --> 47:16.713
Don't move!

47:18.116 --> 47:19.436
You tell her.

47:20.421 --> 47:22.188
Tell her
how nobody cared about the truth

47:22.258 --> 47:24.563
when that drunk
killed my daughter Jessie.

47:25.071 --> 47:27.389
But, oh, with Anna,

47:27.586 --> 47:29.356
well, that was a different story.

47:31.003 --> 47:32.636
Your man here.

47:32.871 --> 47:35.641
So proud to be the smartest
person in the room.

47:35.829 --> 47:38.633
Doesn't care whose life he ruins.

47:39.026 --> 47:40.985
Putting a grieving young girl
in jail.

47:41.116 --> 47:42.939
Norman, I've been thinking
a lot about what you said...

47:42.996 --> 47:44.479
It's too late!

47:47.453 --> 47:49.013
When Anna died...

47:51.196 --> 47:52.756
.. I came here to kill you.

47:53.687 --> 47:56.181
And it seemed like somebody
had beaten me to it.

48:01.412 --> 48:02.482
It was you.

48:02.593 --> 48:04.399
I saw you die.

48:04.728 --> 48:07.168
And I thought, "Finally.

48:08.110 --> 48:09.344
"Finally I can move on."

48:09.402 --> 48:12.118
And then you walked into my store
and I knew what I had to do.

48:12.273 --> 48:13.743
You broke into the police station.

48:13.909 --> 48:16.165
Well, there was a certain poetic justice

48:16.223 --> 48:17.973
about killing you
with a police weapon.

48:18.095 --> 48:20.149
Norman, two innocent men
have already lost...

48:20.207 --> 48:22.157
Two innocent girls!

48:23.335 --> 48:26.535
My daughters... Gone.

48:27.753 --> 48:29.682
I've lost everything.
I've lost everyone...

48:29.740 --> 48:31.252
Have you finished
with your self-pity?

48:31.309 --> 48:32.545
Jean, don't.

48:32.932 --> 48:34.893
What about that poor boy's mother?

48:35.346 --> 48:36.906
Did she deserve to lose her son?

48:36.964 --> 48:38.190
Did he deserve to die?

48:38.248 --> 48:39.315
- Jean, please.
- Hey!

48:39.374 --> 48:40.620
Don't move.

48:41.510 --> 48:43.020
Or I swear I'll shoot her.

48:43.193 --> 48:44.429
Shoot me, then!

48:44.516 --> 48:45.549
For God's sake, Jean!

48:45.636 --> 48:47.376
What about your daughters?
Did they deserve to die?

48:47.433 --> 48:48.756
Of course they didn't.

48:49.593 --> 48:51.417
And Lucien doesn't either.

48:52.316 --> 48:54.870
But if you take him then
I've got nothing left,

48:55.146 --> 48:57.426
so you might as well
just shoot me first.

49:00.716 --> 49:02.229
Gun down, Mr Baker.

49:11.036 --> 49:12.996
- No!
- Norman, no! Please!

49:14.156 --> 49:16.066
You're right. You're absolutely right.

49:16.487 --> 49:20.556
I hurt people and I don't realise it
till the damage is done.

49:21.129 --> 49:25.167
I race off blindly, leaving...

49:26.024 --> 49:28.378
.. leaving an almighty
mess behind me.

49:29.025 --> 49:32.135
Norman, your daughter.

49:34.556 --> 49:36.436
Your beautiful daughter.

49:38.556 --> 49:40.081
I'm sorry.

49:42.558 --> 49:45.518
I'm so sorry.

49:52.872 --> 49:54.072
Please, Norman.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.479
Blake, would you mind?

50:16.996 --> 50:18.534
Let's go, Norman.

50:31.490 --> 50:33.516
You mean it was all a mistake?

50:34.891 --> 50:37.055
That man just didn't know
he'd be here?

50:37.113 --> 50:40.360
Yes. Mrs Simmons, Miss Kingham,

50:41.266 --> 50:43.235
you have our deepest sympathies.

50:43.711 --> 50:46.813
And if there's any you may need,
you let us know.

50:47.205 --> 50:48.805
Ned was family here.

50:50.877 --> 50:53.957
Come on, love. Let's get you home.

50:54.799 --> 50:56.109
You too, Charlie.

50:56.883 --> 50:58.469
No, I'm fine, boss.

51:01.841 --> 51:03.234
Why is he still here?

51:03.344 --> 51:04.454
Not now, Mr Tyneman.

51:04.512 --> 51:06.285
I want him charged now!

51:06.469 --> 51:08.980
Or my paper will start running
articles about the corruption

51:09.075 --> 51:10.188
and incompetence here

51:10.259 --> 51:11.957
until you all lose your jobs.

51:12.015 --> 51:13.535
Or perhaps I charge you

51:13.610 --> 51:16.373
with threatening behaviour
and attempted blackmail.

51:17.436 --> 51:18.796
And, Edward...

51:20.823 --> 51:23.996
.. if you come after any of my
friends again, I promise you,

51:24.054 --> 51:27.035
I will knock your bloody lights out.

51:28.588 --> 51:30.238
Now get out of here.

51:33.501 --> 51:35.645
Well, I'll be writing about
this in the paper tomorrow.

51:35.702 --> 51:37.785
No, you won't.

51:39.111 --> 51:41.541
You'll be packing
your bags and leaving.

51:41.753 --> 51:43.277
You're done here.

51:43.761 --> 51:45.947
What? You can't make me do that.

51:46.017 --> 51:51.496
Go now and I'll pay you a monthly
wage to start your life over again.

51:51.620 --> 51:55.136
Stay, you're on your own.

51:59.239 --> 52:00.719
Your notice.

52:18.436 --> 52:21.334
You can tell Miss Anderson
her job's waiting for her,

52:21.936 --> 52:23.556
if she still wants it.

52:26.036 --> 52:27.561
Patrick...

52:29.013 --> 52:30.973
Merry Christmas, gentlemen.

52:44.630 --> 52:46.223
Lunch is almost ready.

52:46.701 --> 52:49.266
Make yourself useful, Charlie.
Start picking up all this.

52:49.353 --> 52:51.436
Give it a rest, Uncle Matthew.

52:53.036 --> 52:54.318
Charlie.

52:54.453 --> 52:56.107
For you, apparently.

52:58.078 --> 52:59.717
Oh.

53:12.264 --> 53:13.717
That's my dad.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.034
A friend found it in the
news archives in Collingwood.

53:16.092 --> 53:17.215
It's nothing.

53:18.590 --> 53:21.271
Thanks. I like it.

53:22.196 --> 53:24.466
Doc, you don't mind
if I propose a toast, do you?

53:24.553 --> 53:26.356
Oh please, Bill. By all means.

53:29.368 --> 53:31.209
To absent friends.

53:32.309 --> 53:34.014
And to those we've lost.

53:34.702 --> 53:36.115
To Ned.

53:36.696 --> 53:38.162
To Ned.

53:42.799 --> 53:44.439
And to William Munro.

53:46.328 --> 53:48.001
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

53:48.521 --> 53:50.451
Everybody,
come and take a seat.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.170
- Ahh!
- Rose, thank you.

53:52.228 --> 53:55.071
- Come on through, you lot.
- Thank you.

53:57.204 --> 53:58.437
Charlie.

53:58.719 --> 54:02.152
Lucien...
These are so beautiful.

54:02.357 --> 54:03.717
You are beautiful.

54:03.801 --> 54:04.952
I've got one more thing for you.

54:05.009 --> 54:07.803
- Oh, Jean, you didn't need to...
- No no, it's only small.

54:08.857 --> 54:12.271
Honestly, you spoil me.

54:18.476 --> 54:21.607
I thought perhaps we should
choose a date,

54:21.876 --> 54:24.475
and maybe start inviting people.

54:26.316 --> 54:29.381
This is the best Christmas
present ever.

54:30.695 --> 54:32.375
You know I snore.

54:33.906 --> 54:36.060
For better or for worse, Lucien.

54:45.710 --> 54:48.420
Right, you lot.
Who's carving?
