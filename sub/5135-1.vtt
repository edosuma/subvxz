01:52.000 --> 01:55.214
<i>A lot of the better
bowlers really--</i>

01:55.216 --> 01:57.483
Got another one, Dad.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.718
Leave it outside.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.887
Can I get paid?

02:02.989 --> 02:05.390
You know
where the register is.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.911
Mountain Vista Motel.
Why are you calling?

03:34.548 --> 03:37.749
One room will cost you $22.

03:38.818 --> 03:41.253
<i>Yes, that does
include towels.</i>

03:41.255 --> 03:45.924
And, um, yeah.
Towels and free heat.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.572
<i>Mr. Parker, we had
a lean couple of months.</i>

06:15.341 --> 06:18.410
Well, summer's here.
High season.

06:18.412 --> 06:23.982
Um, you know,
a few good months and, um,

06:23.984 --> 06:26.818
and we'll be back on our feet
by September, I promise.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.654
And I'll have a payment
to you by October
at the very latest.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.094
Mr. Parker, please.
If you could ju--

06:43.903 --> 06:46.772
Nice of you to call.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.975
Thank you
for your understanding.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.235
Mm? Yeah.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.272
Good boy.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.281
I got another one!

11:00.026 --> 11:03.028
You--
You gonna have to
take an IOU, Ted.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.499
You're the only one
makin' any money here.

11:10.603 --> 11:15.674
Why don't you, um--
Why don't you clean up
Rooms 1 through 5 today?

11:15.676 --> 11:17.676
There's nobody in there!

11:17.678 --> 11:19.711
Don't forget
to feed the chickens.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.546
And don't leave
the feed bag out
this time.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.049
Deer keep getting in.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.479
This is our honeymoon suite.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.815
Perfect for a lovely couple
like yourselves.

12:03.656 --> 12:08.393
This is our honeymoon suite.
Perfect for a lovely couple
like yourselves.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.932
Hey, Ted!
Dinner.

12:17.002 --> 12:18.770
Hey, Ted?

12:42.862 --> 12:45.463
Oh, there you are.
Grab a seat.

12:55.474 --> 12:59.644
Noodles and hot dogs.
Your favorite.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.818
You know what today is?

13:06.820 --> 13:10.488
- My birthday.
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:10.490 --> 13:14.092
You know how old you are?
I'm nine.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.828
Yeah. Hard to believe,
isn't it?

13:19.498 --> 13:22.033
Okay. Hold on.
Just stay right there.

13:26.839 --> 13:29.140
I was hopin'
to surprise you.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.894
Here we go.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.338
There.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.240
There you are.
Turn it off!

14:36.542 --> 14:39.143
Oh, you loved this song.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.479
We used to sing it to you
every night before you--

14:42.548 --> 14:46.150
Ted.
Oh, come on.

14:46.152 --> 14:49.087
Ted.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.626
Te--

15:21.453 --> 15:23.755
Shut up!

16:30.122 --> 16:32.523
Come on. Come on.

17:56.175 --> 17:59.610
Ted! Ted!

18:44.723 --> 18:46.591
Get those lights.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.660
Okay. Here you go.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.298
This is our honeymoon suite.

18:54.300 --> 18:58.736
Listen. We got a--
We got a hospital
just 20 minutes from here.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.139
It'd be wise
if I tried to get you there.
No. I'm okay.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.908
I just--
I need to lie down.

19:03.910 --> 19:07.979
Well, look, um--
I'll get you
some more towels.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.981
You're gonna need those.
Come on, Ted. Now.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.927
Checkout's at 11:00
tomorrow.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.178
Did you see what happened?
No.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.013
All right.

20:16.015 --> 20:20.218
Oh, that poor thing.
Why don't you stand back?

20:21.386 --> 20:23.554
Do you see
what I'm about to do?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.656
Do you understand why?

20:25.658 --> 20:27.592
All right?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.761
Um--

20:46.178 --> 20:49.947
Kind of a shame
to waste all this meat.
What do you think?

21:09.601 --> 21:12.703
I'm a little rusty
at this.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.373
Ted, why don't you
drag that over here?

21:19.378 --> 21:21.979
Okay.
Why don't you just put it
right under here?

21:25.450 --> 21:26.851
Would you hold
your light up?

21:29.889 --> 21:33.090
Okay. Now look.

21:33.092 --> 21:38.929
Here's what you do.
You just...
just slide it in.

21:38.931 --> 21:44.402
And then you cut down.
You don't want to...
rupture the stomach.

21:50.776 --> 21:53.411
Then I gotta take
all the organs out.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.020
Get into that stomach.

22:06.925 --> 22:09.293
Oh, you see that?

22:09.295 --> 22:12.029
You gotta get
all of that out.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.171
Will you
hand me that saw?

23:00.645 --> 23:03.914
Here.
A souvenir.

24:25.764 --> 24:28.365
Leave the man alone, Ted!

25:30.462 --> 25:33.364
I see you.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.951
Haven't seen him this morning.
Should still be in there.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.953
- Should still be?
- He should.

26:41.701 --> 26:44.068
Mr. Colby.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.742
Mr. Colby, this is, uh--
This is Deacon Whit.

26:51.744 --> 26:54.712
Oh, sorry to bother you.
But, uh,

26:54.714 --> 26:57.014
I'd like to ask you
a few questions, if I might.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.051
A little out of it.
I can understand that.

27:03.321 --> 27:05.656
Um,
so what brings you to town?

27:07.759 --> 27:10.227
Just passing through.

27:12.063 --> 27:14.331
You traveling alone?
Mm, yeah.

27:16.267 --> 27:19.703
I'm gonna need to see
your license and registration,
if you don't mind.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.675
It's in the car,
wherever you guys towed it.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.710
Mind if I have a look
in the car?

27:28.146 --> 27:30.247
I'd prefer you didn't.
Hmm.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.083
Anything else?

27:33.085 --> 27:34.818
Looks like you got
banged up pretty bad.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.421
You might want to have
someone take a look at it.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.393
It's been nice
chatting with you.
Yup.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.768
Thank you for comin' by.
You got it.

28:45.523 --> 28:47.791
Room service!

28:58.369 --> 29:00.838
Close the door.

29:08.947 --> 29:11.448
Need any
fresh towels?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.584
No, thanks.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.252
Want those clothes
cleaned?

29:15.254 --> 29:17.788
I can try
and get the stains out.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.867
You want it, kid?

29:33.071 --> 29:35.038
You want it?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.811
How did you do that?

29:43.948 --> 29:46.617
That's a secret,
little man.

29:48.419 --> 29:50.287
You have any secrets?

29:54.125 --> 29:56.627
Maybe.
Probably not.

30:04.135 --> 30:07.304
You wouldn't happen to know
where they towed my car,
would you?

30:07.306 --> 30:09.506
There's a junkyard
down the road.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.889
What ya doing, Whit?

30:58.891 --> 31:00.557
Oh, just poking around.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.064
Looking for anything
in particular?
I don't know really.

31:08.633 --> 31:11.568
I could look the other way,
if it'd make you feel better.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.704
No. Don't bother.

31:38.696 --> 31:40.230
Perfect.

31:41.432 --> 31:44.034
We've been driving forever.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.937
All right.
I could use somethin' to eat myself.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.655
Okay. Why don't
you guys hang here,
and I'll go check us in?

32:05.723 --> 32:08.058
Okay, hon.

32:26.644 --> 32:30.213
We got you--
We got you in Room 5.

32:30.215 --> 32:32.049
Right down here.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.052
We'll have a fresh pot of coffee
brewing for you in the lobby,

32:35.054 --> 32:36.954
first thing in the morning.
Okay.

32:36.956 --> 32:40.424
So if you need anything else,
don't hesitate to call on us.

32:40.426 --> 32:44.628
All right. Uh, a place to eat?
Do you know if
there's anywhere nearby?

32:44.630 --> 32:47.164
It's a bit of a drive
to the closest diner.

32:47.166 --> 32:50.634
I'll tell you what.
My son and I were just about
to have ourselves some dinner.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.903
- Why don't you join us?
- I don't know.

32:52.905 --> 32:55.339
And-And tomorrow morning,
you're not gonna believe
this view.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.307
And over there,
we've got ourselves a pool.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.142
Your son's
gonna love that.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.718
How y'all
like it cooked?

33:09.087 --> 33:11.588
Medium would be great.
Thank you.

33:14.292 --> 33:16.193
How long you guys
owned this place?

33:16.195 --> 33:19.997
Well, Ted's granddad,
he built this
with his own hands.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.832
Back when this was
a destination spot.

33:23.301 --> 33:25.535
People used to
drive here from all over,
just to--

33:25.537 --> 33:28.772
Just to see the view.

33:28.774 --> 33:32.776
This-- This is
all gonna be Ted's
one of these days.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.878
Isn't that right, Son?

35:01.199 --> 35:03.934
Mornin'.

35:03.936 --> 35:07.003
Honey, not too close
to the highway.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.041
Honey!

35:13.611 --> 35:14.711
Oh!

35:16.147 --> 35:17.981
Oh, Jesus.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.489
Hey, you comin' in
or what?

35:59.491 --> 36:02.058
I don't have
a bathing suit.
Go in in your shorts.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.427
Okay.

37:45.296 --> 37:46.930
Ready.

37:47.965 --> 37:51.401
And away we go.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.011
Fuck.

38:07.451 --> 38:10.987
Come on.
I'll be right back.

38:17.161 --> 38:19.663
Well, best I can do
is call a mechanic.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.104
How long you think
that will take?

38:28.106 --> 38:31.174
Mmm.
Long as it takes,
I guess.

38:31.176 --> 38:34.010
- Yeah.
-             Are you kidding me?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.914
Appreciate it.
Sure.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.996
Okay, you can come out now.

41:23.614 --> 41:26.816
Shit. Get in.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.726
Okay.

41:44.034 --> 41:45.935
Got it.

42:08.325 --> 42:09.792
You want it?

42:12.630 --> 42:15.465
Guests always
leave their junk behind.

42:22.039 --> 42:26.142
- Yeah, like what?
- Old magazines and things.

42:26.977 --> 42:29.479
Weird adult stuff.

42:31.682 --> 42:33.983
Occupational hazard,
I suppose.

42:37.655 --> 42:39.722
Where do you live?

42:42.526 --> 42:44.427
Nowhere now.

42:49.099 --> 42:50.934
I guess you're staying
with us for a while.

42:54.271 --> 42:56.940
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you stranded me here
on purpose.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.286
What's in the box?

43:20.064 --> 43:22.765
When people die,
they either bury 'em
in the ground...

43:24.568 --> 43:26.970
or they're burned down
into a box like this.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.476
There's a person in there?

43:42.252 --> 43:44.821
How do they do it?
In an oven?

43:48.559 --> 43:51.194
Yeah.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.798
Do you watch them?

44:06.076 --> 44:10.680
Can I see?
No.

44:10.682 --> 44:14.651
- Why not?
- You know what?
We better get goin'.

44:15.686 --> 44:17.654
Come on.

44:26.463 --> 44:29.699
It's just
you and your dad here, huh?
Yeah.

44:29.701 --> 44:32.201
Mom's in Florida.

44:32.203 --> 44:35.705
Oranges grow there
all year, and there
are 27 types of palm tress.

44:36.473 --> 44:38.875
Hmm. Sounds nice.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.248
I don't really
remember her much.

44:48.152 --> 44:50.753
Left with a trucker
that was staying
in Room 5.

44:54.191 --> 44:57.093
Florida, huh?

44:57.995 --> 45:00.196
Never been.

45:00.198 --> 45:03.066
Wanna go?

45:03.068 --> 45:07.003
Can't say I know
where I'm going exactly,
but... you never know.

45:07.005 --> 45:09.639
If we drive straight through,
we can make it in two days.

45:09.641 --> 45:11.774
Or we can stop at a motel
for a night.

45:14.078 --> 45:18.514
What kind of car
do you have?
What kind of car do I have?

45:18.516 --> 45:22.118
Yeah.
I have a totaled car.
That's what kind of car I have.

45:23.921 --> 45:25.822
Smashed to bits.

45:41.839 --> 45:45.641
Thanks again.
Drive safe now.

45:56.553 --> 45:58.454
We got a customer?

46:01.692 --> 46:04.293
Inside, Ted.
We need to talk.

46:09.466 --> 46:11.100
How's it goin'?

46:27.551 --> 46:29.452
Get your hands
out of that drawer.

46:32.723 --> 46:37.059
Listen. We got ourselves
a little business
coming our way this weekend.

46:37.061 --> 46:38.795
What kind of business?

46:38.797 --> 46:41.164
It's called a prom.
You remember that
from a couple years ago?

46:41.166 --> 46:42.899
Isn't that the dance?
That's right.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.601
We're gonna
have a dance here?

46:45.603 --> 46:47.370
We're gonna have
the after-party at least.

46:48.672 --> 46:52.909
An after-party?
Just a little harmless fun.

46:52.911 --> 46:56.479
Let boys be boys.
Let girls be girls.

46:56.481 --> 46:59.081
You understand
what I'm saying, Ted?

46:59.083 --> 47:01.651
Just for one night.
All right?

47:07.958 --> 47:09.859
Keep your hands
out of there.

47:22.372 --> 47:25.374
Sorry about earlier.
I didn't mean
to scare you.

47:29.313 --> 47:30.847
It's okay.

47:33.116 --> 47:35.351
Wanna see somethin'?

47:39.189 --> 47:41.924
I promised my mom
I'd stay close to the hotel.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.394
<i>It's a motel not a hotel.</i>

51:28.752 --> 51:31.053
All righty.

51:31.055 --> 51:34.356
Well,
it's an electrical issue
is all.

51:34.358 --> 51:36.859
Wire'd come loose
and your fuse box
shorted out.

51:36.861 --> 51:39.962
So, replaced the fasteners
for good measure.
Oh, thank you.

51:39.964 --> 51:42.098
Don't mention it.
Good thing y'all were here,

51:42.100 --> 51:45.134
'cause, car conkin' out on you
on the highway,
you could be in trouble.

51:45.136 --> 51:47.369
Yeah.
Is it fixed?

51:47.371 --> 51:49.738
All fixed, ma'am.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.874
Whoo-hoo.
All right. Yeah.

51:51.876 --> 51:53.609
Benny--
Let's get goin', baby.
Grab that stuff.

51:53.611 --> 51:54.944
Yeah.

51:57.547 --> 52:00.716
In you go.
Thanks again.
No problem.

52:08.225 --> 52:10.326
Come visit us again!

52:12.562 --> 52:15.331
Room 5 just checked out.
And look what they
left behind.

52:19.636 --> 52:21.971
Oh.

52:23.473 --> 52:25.341
Can I keep it?
They might come back for it.

52:26.476 --> 52:28.344
Nobody ever comes back.

52:29.913 --> 52:33.749
Ted, the only one who's lived
here longer than you is me.

52:33.751 --> 52:35.184
I know how lonely it gets.

52:36.920 --> 52:39.355
And I know you wish
you had friends
your own age.

52:39.357 --> 52:41.257
Right?
I have friends.

52:41.259 --> 52:44.126
No, customers
don't count.

52:44.128 --> 52:47.163
Look, when I was, um--

52:49.533 --> 52:53.869
When I was your age,
the only memories I have
are of my dad... workin' here.

52:57.174 --> 53:00.676
I would follow him around,
eyes and ears wide open,
lookin' up at him.

53:02.546 --> 53:06.782
It just seemed like he was
carryin' this whole place
on his shoulders.

53:10.320 --> 53:13.389
You know, your eyes,
they're gonna see more than
I've seen in my entire life.

53:17.294 --> 53:20.462
I know we talked about you
runnin' this place some day.
But--

53:23.133 --> 53:25.734
Some things--
You know--

53:25.736 --> 53:27.603
Some things just don't--

53:34.578 --> 53:36.412
Oh, hell. You can keep it.
'Course you can.

53:39.349 --> 53:44.019
Why don't you, uh,
go ahead and break down
the bedding in Room 5?

53:44.021 --> 53:47.923
Do I have to?
Those linens aren't gonna
change themselves.

57:36.119 --> 57:38.987
Here, boy.

57:38.989 --> 57:41.356
- Here, boy.
-         Here, boy.

57:44.395 --> 57:47.162
Hey!
Shut the fuck up, Sid!

58:09.619 --> 58:11.353
Can I have one?

58:22.632 --> 58:24.566
You guys got bats.

58:27.670 --> 58:30.606
Yeah. I know
where they live.
Wanna see?

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:32.160
Oh, hey.

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:33.629
Oh, hey.

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.797
I wanted to pay for tonight.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:38.200
Cash?
Yeah.

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.504
Any word on my car?

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:44.072
Not yet.

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:46.041
I'll, um--

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.645
I'll give 'em a call.

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:51.980
'Preciate it.
Yeah.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.915
Hey. Look at that.

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:59.021
If this damn screen
lets in one more mosquito--

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.858
You wouldn't happen to
have an extra, would you?

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:17.472
I, uh,
try not to smoke
in front of Ted.

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:20.142
Don't want him
picking up any bad habits.

01:01:20.144 --> 01:01:23.879
I swear,
the kid's got eyes growing
out the back of his head.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.282
Yeah.

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:30.352
Can't do
anything around here
without him watching.

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.789
Must be hard
growing up out here.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.625
Uh-huh.

01:01:36.627 --> 01:01:39.895
People here,
they come and go.

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.232
Hard not to get attached
to the guests.

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:47.569
That so?

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.374
Yeah. We had this one time
a while back.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:54.076
We had a family
stayin' here,

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:58.046
and Ted, he got
a puppy-dog crush
on one of their girls.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:01.483
He was following her
around everywhere.

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:06.221
Yeah, that poor kid,
he had his heart broken
when they finally checked out.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.990
He climbed in the back
of their station wagon
when no one was looking.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.529
And that family,
they drove for about
an hour before, uh--

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:17.299
before they realized
they had themselves
a little stowaway.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.938
Dad turned his car around.
Had to drive all the way back,
drop Ted off.

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.775
Sobbed
the whole way home.

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.445
I'll make sure to double-check
my trunk before I leave.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.283
Boy can't help it.

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:41.189
What would make my life
a lot easier...

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:45.193
is if you
kept some distance.

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:53.168
Lot of responsibility
running a motel.

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:56.838
Must be hard to find the time
to be a dad.

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.947
Boy's growing
like a weed.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.985
Won't be long before
he's bigger than me.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:14.489
I'll call the garage
for you.

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:18.527
Won't be much longer I bet,
and then I, uh--

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.730
I guess
you'll be on your way.

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:20.248
You stole my money!

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.450
It's called
freezing your assets.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:25.287
- You stole it!
- Tough titty.

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:28.723
I'm keeping it for you.
You're a flight risk.

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:32.193
Hey!

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:33.862
Go put fresh towels
in Room 2.

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.132
No!
You go clean up Room 2
right now.

01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:39.134
What did you just--
Say it again, Ted.

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:42.771
Say it again.
Say it again.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.207
No!

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.177
You--

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.179
<i>Whit, you there?</i>

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:11.052
Yeah.

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:13.855
<i> Did some more digging
 into those plates you ran.</i>

01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:16.624
<i> The owner's wife
 has been deceased
 as of two weeks now.</i>

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:18.660
<i> Circumstances of her death
 are pretty suspicious.</i>

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.131
Go on.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:25.767
<i>Firefighters picked up a 10-80.</i>

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:28.435
<i> Figured it was
 an electrical fire.
 Nobody home.</i>

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:31.639
<i>They found a body
in the kitchen.
Now they're suspecting arson.</i>

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.881
<i> Still there,
 Whit?</i>

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:43.218
'Preciate that there, Jim.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.322
<i>There's an open investigation.</i>

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.990
<i>William Colby
is a person of interest,</i>

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:51.759
<i>but there's
no solid evidence yet.</i>

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:54.595
<i>Seems like this couple
has a history
of insurance claims.</i>

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:56.564
<i>They've been on a watch list
for the past--</i>

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.193
Mind if I join you?

01:09:28.596 --> 01:09:30.198
Everything
all right?

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:34.068
Can't wait to get
outta this place.

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.645
I don't know.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:47.015
You got everything
a kid could ever want
right here.

01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:55.723
My wife grew up
in a place like this.

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:58.259
You have a wife?
Had.

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.396
Where is she now?

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:08.736
She's the one in the box.

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:13.241
How'd she die?

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:21.616
There was...
a fire in our house.

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.753
I couldn't get to her in time.

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:31.459
When you leave,

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.063
can you
take me with you?

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.839
Maybe next time.

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:51.312
You said you'd take me
to Florida.

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:59.187
My wife and I wanted
a son like you.

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:06.494
Your wife is nothing
but a pile of dirt now.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.653
What did you do with her?
Huh?

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.655
Dad!
What did you do
with her?

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.424
Dad!
Where is the bag?

01:14:56.426 --> 01:14:59.260
Where's the bag?
Ow! I don't have it!

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:00.995
Ow!

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:04.499
<i>Listen up.
I am not fucking around!
Where is she?</i>

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:08.369
In the junkyard!
I hid her in the junkyard.

01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:09.871
Show me!

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.402
Okay.

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:45.439
Where is she?
It's back there.

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:49.810
Where in the fucking back?

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.117
Give me
the fucking bag.

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.326
Ted.

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:12.867
Do you have any fucking idea
what I've been through?

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:16.604
Don't do this, Ted.

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:23.844
Ted.

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:26.447
Where'd you put the bag?

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.820
Give me the fucking bag!

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:32.139
<i>to all you couples out there
on the dance floor.</i>

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:35.543
<i>Let's give all you seniors
a night to remember.</i>

01:18:35.545 --> 01:18:38.846
<i>But don't forget.
When prom's over, let's all
try to be responsible...</i>

01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:41.082
<i>and get home safe and sound.</i>

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:45.486
<i>To the graduating class of 1989,
this one's for you.</i>

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:47.488
<i>Take it away, seniors.</i>

01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:07.334
Whoo-hoo!

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:24.518
There you go.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.555
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thanks.

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:35.496
What about Room 2?
Oh. Occupied.

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:37.198
Thought you said
we'd have the whole place
to ourselves.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.866
No, I said
that we have a customer...

01:20:38.868 --> 01:20:41.869
might need to stay
another night or
a little longer, and--

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:44.371
Sorry about that.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:47.875
The fuck you're sorry.
We had a deal.

01:20:47.877 --> 01:20:49.877
Well, you got
the rest of the place
to yourself.

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:55.115
Listen, old man,

01:20:55.117 --> 01:20:57.985
I can take my party
elsewhere.

01:20:57.987 --> 01:21:02.389
So...
you either cut me a deal,
or I'm gonna get outta here.

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:04.558
I've already
given you a discount.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.461
Okay.
I've given you a discount. Sir--

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:09.530
Okay, listen. Hey.
Come back here.
Come back here.

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:10.798
Come back here.

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:20.407
All right.

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:23.978
I'll knock off 10%.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.980
Ted, show him his rooms.

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:27.748
Pretty sure
I can find it.

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.623
Oh, yeah!

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:42.429
We're running a dead motel, Son.

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:46.433
These rooms
just don't know it yet.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.341
What could we do?

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:57.578
You're the one
with the business sense.
Maybe you could figure it out.

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:01.982
We could leave.

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.586
You take after your mother.

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:36.884
- Is that a freshman?
- Hey.

01:22:36.886 --> 01:22:39.887
Hold up.
You're that kid
who lives here, aren't you?

01:22:39.889 --> 01:22:42.456
Do you have any extra soap?

01:22:45.393 --> 01:22:47.161
Come on.
Just a little sip.

01:22:47.163 --> 01:22:48.963
It'll put hair
on your chest.

01:22:57.839 --> 01:23:00.507
Oh.

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:04.678
It burns.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.881
- Holy shit.
- "It burns. It burns."

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:11.919
You put fire
in my throat.

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.855
Come on.
We were just playing.

01:23:14.857 --> 01:23:16.357
Come back!

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:05.105
Marcus. Shots.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:10.377
Fuck you doin'?

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:15.049
Let's go.

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.261
Forgot my beer.

01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:36.964
Fuck.

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:41.468
What the fuck?

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:44.004
Holy shit.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.609
- What the fuck
were you doing?

01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:52.746
Let me go! Let me go!

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:56.049
The fuck was that?

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.022
Get up!

01:26:02.024 --> 01:26:03.724
He was groping Sarah!

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.660
Ow! Ow!

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:10.130
What the fuck
were you gonna do?
Let me go!

01:26:10.132 --> 01:26:11.698
Hey.
Stop it.

01:26:13.369 --> 01:26:15.269
Whoa, man, check it out.

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:20.040
Ow!

01:26:21.976 --> 01:26:23.977
What the fuck?

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.982
- No! No!
- Stop it!

01:26:28.984 --> 01:26:30.918
Stop it.

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:34.488
What the fuck
is your problem, asshole?

01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:37.324
Marcus! Marcus, stop!

01:26:37.326 --> 01:26:39.393
Please! No!

01:26:39.395 --> 01:26:41.795
Marcus! Marcus!

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:45.566
Fuck off!
Get the fuck out!

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:49.102
Are you okay?

01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:39.786
Dad!

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:47.127
Dad! Dad!

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:09.850
Dad?

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:12.185
Ted?

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.223
What--

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.960
What did they do to you?

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:23.497
Dad--
Oh, my God.

01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:25.799
What did they do to you?

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.200
Ted--

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:30.170
Oh, goddamn it.

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:32.406
Oh, goddamn it.

01:28:32.408 --> 01:28:35.575
Why? Huh?

01:28:35.577 --> 01:28:37.344
Why couldn't you
listen to me?

01:28:37.346 --> 01:28:41.748
Ted, what did I tell you?
What did I say, huh?

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:45.085
You just leave 'em alone, right?
You leave 'em alone!

01:28:45.087 --> 01:28:47.120
Huh? You gotta
do everything your own way!

01:28:47.122 --> 01:28:49.623
Right? Oh, Ted--

01:28:51.527 --> 01:28:54.094
All right, you--
You wanna do things
your own way?

01:28:54.096 --> 01:28:56.330
You wanna run this place?
Is that it?

01:28:56.332 --> 01:28:58.665
Huh? All right,
well, here's the first rule.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:01.368
All right.
Here's the first... rule.

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:03.470
You leave
the customers alone!

01:29:03.472 --> 01:29:05.372
Ted?

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:09.943
You leave the goddamn
customers alone!

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:14.281
Goddamn it, Ted.

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:22.622
Ted?

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:24.358
Ted!

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:53.453
A sophomore, right?
A rising sophomore.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.768
Turn that music louder.
Come on.

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:54.247
Fuck, yeah!

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:57.117
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

01:30:57.119 --> 01:31:00.454
Chug! Go! Go! Chug!

01:31:00.456 --> 01:31:02.956
Come on!

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.874
Sarah.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:31.645
Wake up. Wake up.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.068
Welcome to
the Mountain Vista Motel.

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.101
Hope you had
a lovely stay.

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:49.509
This is gonna sting
a little bit, buddy.

01:40:49.511 --> 01:40:51.110
All right.
Hold still.

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:54.547
It's okay.

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:58.418
Yeah, that's okay, buddy.

01:41:50.704 --> 01:41:53.372
When was the last time
you saw the man in Room 2?

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:59.879
A few hours ago.
He was looking in some windows.

01:42:08.222 --> 01:42:10.523
Didn't he say
his wife died
in a fire?

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:24.737
We gonna need to do
a whole sweep of this area.

01:42:24.739 --> 01:42:28.241
Put out an APB
on a William Colby.
C-O-L-B-Y.

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:40.386
Sorry to hear
about your dad.

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:44.257
You have
any other family?

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.594
I have a mom in Florida.
