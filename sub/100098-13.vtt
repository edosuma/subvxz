00:34.720 --> 00:36.757
<i>Please,
don't judge me.</i>

00:37.640 --> 00:38.756
<i>This was inevitable.</i>

00:39.440 --> 00:40.794
<i>You saw the earthquakes.</i>

00:41.600 --> 00:43.831
<i>Both of us can't exist here
in this world.</i>

00:46.280 --> 00:47.760
<i>I had no other choice.</i>

00:49.680 --> 00:51.672
<i>Now the only thing left to do
is a full wipe-down.</i>

02:20.600 --> 02:22.353
- Hello?
<i>- Elliot, where are you?</i>

02:22.440 --> 02:24.272
<i>We're all waiting for you
at the beach.</i>

02:25.240 --> 02:27.197
<i>We're ready to take
the wedding party photo.</i>

02:27.280 --> 02:28.600
<i>So, how far away are you?</i>

02:28.680 --> 02:30.160
I'm... I'm still
at my apartment.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.000
<i>Your apartment? What are you
doing there?</i>

02:33.440 --> 02:35.591
<i>It's gonna take you forever
to get to Coney Island.</i>

02:35.680 --> 02:36.830
I'll... I'll be right there.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.753
I was wondering
if you were gonna show up.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.355
Wherever you go, I go.
Remember?

03:42.480 --> 03:44.039
There's a lot
to fill you in on.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
I can see that.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.433
I'm in a hurry, though.
So let's talk on the way, okay?

03:50.880 --> 03:52.473
On the way to what,
exactly?

03:58.840 --> 03:59.910
My wedding.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.879
I didn't think
it was possible.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.759
But Whiterose's machine,
somehow it worked.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.750
She was right.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.113
We're in a world where
everything's better.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.519
Not for him.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.096
If you're here to tell me
what I did was wrong...

04:22.120 --> 04:23.120
Not anymore.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.918
You need to start seeing
that for yourself.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.675
- You don't understand. I had to...
- Had to what?

04:34.240 --> 04:36.357
This is the only
strategy for us.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.596
Strategy?

04:39.440 --> 04:41.960
So what, you're just gonna take
his place? Is that what this is?

04:43.120 --> 04:44.315
It's not that easy.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.950
Why not?

04:50.920 --> 04:52.593
I look
exactly like him.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.070
Trust me when
I tell you this.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.190
You are not him.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.592
I don't have time
to explain this to you.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.270
- You need to stop.
- No.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.637
I'm not letting you
steal this from me.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.352
Just who exactly do you think
the thief is here?

05:26.320 --> 05:28.710
I'm running late.
I gotta get going.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.314
You know
this can't happen.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.870
If you don't want
to help me,

05:38.160 --> 05:39.514
then get the fuck
out of my way.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.000
Unfortunately,
I can't let you get away with this.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.496
You've been parked in this
fire lane for quite a while.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.920
I'm gonna have to
give you a ticket.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.358
- I'm moving it right now.
- I'm gonna have to see some ID first.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.910
Is this your vehicle?

06:43.440 --> 06:44.440
Yeah.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.549
Then I'm gonna need
that ID.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.673
Sir, what is this?
I asked for your ID.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.996
That's my ID.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.990
Sir, this ID belongs
to Elliot Alderson.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.120
Yeah.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
That's me.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.240
This person
is nothing like you.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.476
What's in the box?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.150
Uh, I'm moving.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
In a tuxedo?

07:42.440 --> 07:43.760
I'm headed to my wedding.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.360
Which is it? You're moving,
or you're headed to your wedding?

07:54.480 --> 07:57.871
Okay, sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to open the box for me.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.590
I'm really sorry.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.192
I just really need
to get to my wedding.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.840
Put your hands in the air
right fucking now.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.520
Take two steps back
and get on your knees.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.356
Get on your knees!

08:18.000 --> 08:19.878
Requesting backup at
207 East Broadway.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.353
<i>Copy that, dispatch...</i>

08:33.240 --> 08:34.832
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

08:39.559 --> 08:40.960
Hey! Hey!

09:12.560 --> 09:15.280
- I tried to tell you.
- Leave me the fuck alone.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.275
That's not an option, kiddo.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.795
You should know that
by now.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.839
If you just calm down,
I can tell you what's happening.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.469
You just have to listen.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.630
You can't stop this.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.350
I'm going to marry Angela.
Nothing else matters.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.274
Think about
what you're saying.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.391
- Angela is dead.
- Not in this world.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.830
- That's not Angela.
- I talked to her!

09:45.920 --> 09:46.990
No, you didn't.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.432
I thought things were fine between us.
But it's still the same you, isn't it?

09:51.760 --> 09:53.440
You just don't want me
to be happy, do you?

09:54.080 --> 09:56.436
Why can't you just let me
have this one thing?

09:57.120 --> 09:59.077
Elliot, you need
to listen to me.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.590
No! I don't!

10:01.680 --> 10:03.876
Not anymore!
I'm done listening to you.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.113
I just want to be
fucking alone.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.516
That's

10:18.080 --> 10:20.879
all I've ever really
wanted from you.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.280
Here.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.596
You should put this on.
It's cold out today.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.436
Now you want to help?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.720
That's the only reason
I'm here, kiddo.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.876
Who are all
these people?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.510
Only you know that.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.800
Only I know?

12:17.240 --> 12:19.118
What the fuck is going on?
Where's Angela?

12:28.160 --> 12:29.355
She's not coming.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.360
Why not?

12:41.080 --> 12:42.912
There was never gonna be
a wedding, Elliot.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.160
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.520
No, you don't understand.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.438
Whiterose's machine
created this.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.432
- That's why we're here.
- No, it didn't.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.959
You were right
about her game.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.991
It deactivated the machine,
just like you thought it would.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.080
This is a world
you created.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.156
I created?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.875
I tried to bring you
back here a while ago.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.200
I've been here before?

13:29.960 --> 13:31.633
You accidentally slipped
into it once

13:31.720 --> 13:33.800
when you were going through
your morphine withdrawal.

13:43.920 --> 13:44.920
So...

13:47.160 --> 13:48.674
This is some kind of dream?

13:51.840 --> 13:52.876
No.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.280
Not a dream.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.560
A prison.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.429
A recursive loop
that you constructed

14:04.520 --> 14:05.874
about a year ago,

14:07.800 --> 14:09.439
to keep him occupied

14:11.240 --> 14:12.879
so you could
take control of him.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.160
Who?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.280
The real Elliot.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.240
The real Elliot?

14:42.200 --> 14:44.078
The fuck are you
talking about?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.631
You think the guy that was
back at my apartment

14:48.720 --> 14:49.756
was the real Elliot?

14:52.840 --> 14:55.230
As real as he could be
in this deluded fantasy

14:55.320 --> 14:57.312
that you stuck him in.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.032
I'm the real
Elliot Alderson.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.790
You're no more
Elliot Alderson than I am.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.039
You're just like me,
only a part of him.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.239
And if you don't let go,

15:16.560 --> 15:18.597
he'll never get back
to living his own life.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.800
What life?

15:24.200 --> 15:25.429
I killed him, remember?

15:29.760 --> 15:31.672
You can't kill him,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.279
no matter how hard you try.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.911
This doesn't make
any fucking sense.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.674
If I'm not Elliot...

15:53.720 --> 15:55.154
Who the fuck am I?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.480
You already know.

16:19.760 --> 16:20.876
Angela!

17:09.160 --> 17:11.356
<i>Don't you know your queen?</i>

17:14.160 --> 17:15.560
<i>Ripped</i>

17:17.720 --> 17:18.836
<i>Heaving</i>

17:19.920 --> 17:22.753
<i>Flower bloom at my feet</i>

17:27.720 --> 17:30.792
<i>Don't you know your queen?</i>

17:33.080 --> 17:34.514
<i>Cracked</i>

17:36.760 --> 17:40.151
<i>Peeling, riddled with disease</i>

17:40.240 --> 17:41.356
The people out there,

17:44.280 --> 17:45.999
there's no reason
for them to be here.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.197
<i>Don't you know me?</i>

17:53.560 --> 17:55.358
There was never
gonna be a wedding.

17:58.840 --> 17:59.840
Why not?

18:02.320 --> 18:03.640
Isn't it obvious?

18:05.360 --> 18:06.714
He tried to tell you.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.720
You're not Elliot.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.040
You're the mastermind.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
Hey!

18:36.600 --> 18:38.034
Where the hell are you going?

19:07.240 --> 19:08.840
<i>I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.</i>

19:35.520 --> 19:36.874
Bonsoir, <i>Elliot.</i>

19:46.880 --> 19:47.880
<i>Nine,</i>

19:49.040 --> 19:50.040
<i>eight,</i>

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
<i>seven,</i>

19:52.960 --> 19:53.960
<i>six,</i>

19:54.040 --> 19:57.112
<i>five,</i>

19:57.200 --> 19:58.200
<i>four,</i>

19:59.200 --> 20:00.200
<i>three,</i>

20:01.360 --> 20:02.360
<i>two,</i>

20:03.360 --> 20:04.360
<i>one.</i>

20:07.680 --> 20:11.037
<i>Ready or not, prepare to die.</i>

20:20.040 --> 20:21.040
<i>Elliot.</i>

20:26.640 --> 20:28.313
<i>Just please wake up.</i>

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
<i>Wake up.</i>

20:41.560 --> 20:43.279
<i>Elliot, please wake up.</i>

20:47.880 --> 20:48.880
<i>Elliot.</i>

20:50.280 --> 20:52.920
<i>Please, wake up.</i>

21:03.040 --> 21:04.040
Hello, Elliot.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.200
What is this?

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
What am I doing here?

21:14.280 --> 21:15.794
You don't recognize
this place?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.435
This is your office.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.080
But you're not really Krista.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.157
No. Of course not.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.117
But since you trusted
Krista so much,

21:43.840 --> 21:46.121
the others thought it would be better
if she spoke to you.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.074
Why would I trust any of you?
You've been trying to kill me.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.833
We've been trying to show you the truth,
and you've been resisting.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.556
Not this again.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.636
I can't talk to you.
I need to talk to Darlene.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.720
She's not here.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.280
Where is she?

22:15.920 --> 22:16.920
She's out there,

22:18.320 --> 22:19.320
in the real world.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.480
But I heard her voice.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.640
Yes.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.435
She's trying to wake you.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.595
Elliot's connection to her
is quite strong.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.518
So strong, she's become
his only link to reality.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.314
In fact, it was by design

22:45.400 --> 22:47.278
she was removed
from this fantasy.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.315
Without Darlene,

22:51.520 --> 22:53.989
it was your best chance
at trapping him here.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.915
I'm not listening to this.

23:07.800 --> 23:08.800
Listen to me.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.717
I don't want to be
in this nightmare anymore.

23:13.840 --> 23:14.990
I want to wake up.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.515
I want my life back!

23:31.480 --> 23:33.153
I understand why
you're confused.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.837
I can explain everything
if you let me.

24:00.280 --> 24:04.240
In order for you to fully hear the truth,
first, we need to discuss

24:04.320 --> 24:06.551
Elliot's dissociative
identity disorder.

24:10.120 --> 24:14.239
The first personality was created
the day Elliot jumped out the window...

24:15.520 --> 24:17.240
You're just sick
and don't want to admit it.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.552
The movie's about to start.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.079
<i>The protector
personality...</i>

24:26.000 --> 24:28.959
The one Elliot created
to replace his father...

24:31.240 --> 24:33.880
To protect him
from intolerable situations...

24:34.280 --> 24:36.840
<i>All I was trying to do was
take those punches for you.</i>

24:38.360 --> 24:39.360
Thank you.

24:39.720 --> 24:40.720
Mr. Robot.

24:45.240 --> 24:48.756
Later in life, Elliot created
the mother personality...

24:50.200 --> 24:51.200
<i>The persecutor...</i>

24:51.280 --> 24:52.509
Get up!

24:53.920 --> 24:55.718
Blaming Elliot
for the abuse...

24:55.800 --> 24:58.031
<i>I hate you.
You're nothing.</i>

24:59.720 --> 25:00.720
You're worthless.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.996
<i>Insisting that
he needed to pay for it.</i>

25:03.080 --> 25:05.720
He was weak, and you're just
as weak as him.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.875
Not long after her

25:08.640 --> 25:10.233
came Elliot's younger self...

25:12.720 --> 25:15.952
<i>Who emerged to handle
the abuse he couldn't tolerate.</i>

25:17.720 --> 25:18.790
And with that,

25:20.400 --> 25:23.234
he'd created his own family...

25:24.560 --> 25:25.560
Of sorts.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.416
<i>We're deep down
inside you, Elliot.</i>

25:27.440 --> 25:30.478
<i>You can't leave us,
and we can't leave you.</i>

25:32.280 --> 25:34.511
<i>I guess she
doesn't know about you.</i>

25:35.440 --> 25:36.794
I know all about them, too,

25:37.680 --> 25:39.376
<i>the voyeurs who think
they aren't a part of this</i>

25:39.400 --> 25:41.039
<i>despite being here
for all of it.</i>

25:43.520 --> 25:45.591
And for a while,
we thought we had identified

25:45.680 --> 25:47.353
all of Elliot's personalities.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.156
But there's another one,

25:51.960 --> 25:53.633
who came about
not too long ago.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.920
I don't want to hear
this again.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.640
The truth about who you are?
I think it's time.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.669
Even they agree with me.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.639
I know where
you're going with this.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.550
- It's not true.
- It's okay.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.279
I know why you did it.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.033
Your heart was
in the right place.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.554
You wanted to shelter him,

26:14.640 --> 26:17.280
which is why you
changed his past.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.296
I want you
to tell me about your father.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.960
Kept shoving me away,
and shoving me so hard,

26:22.040 --> 26:24.077
I fell backwards
out the window.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.317
I wasn't changing
anything. That's...

26:29.160 --> 26:30.560
What I thought happened.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.880
But it was his future
you really wanted to protect,

26:33.960 --> 26:35.155
wasn't it?

26:35.280 --> 26:37.590
Get out of here right now,
or I'll call the...

26:37.680 --> 26:38.716
Police?

26:38.800 --> 26:42.316
You want them to find out about the 100
terabytes of child pornography?

26:42.400 --> 26:45.360
<i>That's why you went to such
great lengths to take down all the evil</i>

26:45.440 --> 26:47.830
<i>that surrounded him
in the real world.</i>

26:47.960 --> 26:49.519
<i>So you formed fsociety.</i>

26:50.480 --> 26:53.473
<i>Hello, Evil Corp.
We are fsociety.</i>

26:53.560 --> 26:55.040
Why did you do it?

26:56.080 --> 26:59.073
You loved him so much, you wanted
to save the entire world

26:59.160 --> 27:02.039
so you could make it better
for him, no matter the cost.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.951
That's why you hid him here,

27:05.040 --> 27:06.952
<i>turning his harsh reality...</i>

27:08.920 --> 27:10.070
<i>Into a fantasy.</i>

27:10.800 --> 27:12.234
<i>I can't wait
to marry you tomorrow.</i>

27:12.320 --> 27:13.960
<i>Trapping him
in an endless loop...</i>

27:14.040 --> 27:17.636
I'm stuck in a repetitive,
boring routine.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.110
To keep him safe
until you were ready.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.034
I don't remember any of this.

27:25.280 --> 27:26.714
Why should I trust you?

27:27.840 --> 27:29.433
You've been wrong before.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.520
You're right.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.430
She was wrong.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.195
Krista never quite
figured it out, did she?

27:39.960 --> 27:43.158
She never realized she wasn't
talking to the real Elliot.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.677
She didn't realize she was
always talking to you.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.596
Elliot,
what's wrong?

27:56.760 --> 27:57.830
Nothing.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.718
You're hiding again.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.632
The personality created
to carry Elliot's rage...

28:03.720 --> 28:04.720
Fuck society.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.670
<i>I was angry.
I hated myself.</i>

28:08.760 --> 28:10.877
Angela's dead.
She's fucking dead.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.896
And we need to work
on your anger issues, Elliot.

28:12.920 --> 28:13.920
Shut up!

28:18.800 --> 28:20.280
<i>The vigilante hacker</i>

28:21.280 --> 28:23.351
<i>Elliot always
imagined being...</i>

28:24.040 --> 28:25.713
I don't just
hack you, Krista.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.314
I hack everyone.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.039
The one that
sought vengeance...

28:29.120 --> 28:31.874
<i>Sometimes I dream
of saving the world,</i>

28:31.960 --> 28:34.429
<i>saving everyone from
the invisible hand.</i>

28:34.520 --> 28:36.477
He had it coming.
They all do.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.631
<i>The top 1% of the 1%,</i>

28:38.720 --> 28:40.837
<i>the ones who play God
without permission.</i>

28:40.920 --> 28:42.673
And now I'm gonna
take them down.

28:42.760 --> 28:46.470
The personality that
had gained so much control...

28:46.560 --> 28:50.679
There's something inside me that can't
let go of what we started.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.280
He forgot.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.477
<i>They all think
I'm the ringleader.</i>

28:55.920 --> 28:58.594
Oh, my God, Elliot.
Did you forget again?

28:59.240 --> 29:01.072
Something is going on
with you, Elliot.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.516
You have not been the same
the past couple of months.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.911
He forgot
he was only just another

29:07.000 --> 29:08.275
personality.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.311
- Elliot?
- No. The other one.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.674
<i>Are you Elliot Alderson?</i>

29:13.760 --> 29:17.470
<i>How do I take off a mask
when it stops being a mask?</i>

29:17.560 --> 29:19.199
- Is this you or...
- It's me.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.112
<i>Sometimes my mask
takes over.</i>

29:21.200 --> 29:23.510
<i>He sometimes can
become a different person.</i>

29:23.600 --> 29:27.196
<i>See me,
Elliot Alderson. I am here.</i>

29:27.280 --> 29:29.272
<i>I'm the only one that exists.</i>

29:29.360 --> 29:30.555
You're not Elliot.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.190
<i>- You're the mastermind.</i>
- Mastermind.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.320
And now it's time

29:41.000 --> 29:43.993
for you to give that control
back to the host...

29:47.160 --> 29:49.038
The real Elliot.

30:07.800 --> 30:08.800
No!

30:10.680 --> 30:11.680
Don't do this.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.831
I don't ever have
to give up control.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.759
This isn't your control.
This is your rage.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.198
Then maybe it's time
I used it.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.198
If you wake up, you'll just be
stealing Elliot's life again.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.640
It's my life.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.750
It always will be.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.355
Darlene?

32:23.600 --> 32:25.717
Oh, my God.
You're finally awake.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.600
Are you okay?

32:30.200 --> 32:32.510
I, um,
I should call the nurse.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.634
This is real, isn't it?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.673
Please tell me
this isn't a dream.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.232
This isn't a dream, Elliot.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.718
You're here, right?

33:16.200 --> 33:17.759
I am right here.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.160
I promise.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.874
Nurse should be here
any second.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.073
I thought I'd never
see you again.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.709
I thought I lost you, too.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.120
No way.

34:05.480 --> 34:06.800
I'm not going anywhere.

34:09.040 --> 34:12.112
Well, you sure make it fucking hard
to believe that sometimes.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.914
Do you remember
what happened

34:23.840 --> 34:25.353
when you were at
the power plant?

34:27.719 --> 34:29.712
They said you somehow
stopped a meltdown,

34:29.800 --> 34:32.156
but there was still
an explosion.

34:35.880 --> 34:40.112
The only way you survived was
because the room you were in

34:40.199 --> 34:43.112
had some sort of
advanced shielding.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.079
They found
Whiterose's body.

34:52.280 --> 34:53.634
She's officially dead,

34:55.280 --> 34:58.432
along with that machine
Angela said she was hiding.

34:59.320 --> 35:03.280
When you cut the power supply,
it malfunctioned and blew up.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.800
It was under the rubble,
totally pulverized.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.120
Guess it's official.

35:11.880 --> 35:15.351
You saved the world,
Elliot Alderson.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.272
I don't think I can do this.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.272
Do what?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.193
Darlene...

36:02.840 --> 36:04.718
Who I am...

36:10.600 --> 36:12.512
It isn't real.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.480
Elliot.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Look at me.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.713
You remember
my promise to you.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.998
As long as I was
here for you,

36:26.720 --> 36:28.439
as long as you could
hold my hand,

36:28.520 --> 36:30.637
then you would know that
this is real.

36:32.360 --> 36:35.034
And I am telling you,
this is real.

36:35.120 --> 36:37.840
I was there with you
through all of it.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.958
fsociety,
our hack on E Corp,

36:41.040 --> 36:44.238
Five/Nine, you going to prison,
the cyberbombings,

36:44.320 --> 36:46.437
us robbing those
evil motherfuckers

36:46.520 --> 36:47.795
after what they did to...

36:51.120 --> 36:52.120
Angela.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.160
Angela, she's gone.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.800
Same with Romero,

37:00.400 --> 37:03.791
Trenton, Mobley, Shayla.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.117
Elliot, I wouldn't
lie to you.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.632
This isn't in your head.
This is real.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.595
But I'm...

37:27.480 --> 37:28.480
Not.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.237
What are you talking about?

37:33.320 --> 37:36.757
Of course you are real.
You are right here.

37:43.440 --> 37:44.440
I'm not him.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.600
Darlene...

37:52.880 --> 37:53.996
I'm not Elliot.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.113
I'm only a part of him.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.032
I know.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.110
I know you're not him.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.437
Not the Elliot
I grew up with, at least.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.989
I've known since
we started fsociety.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.440
You don't act like him.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.434
At first, I thought

38:56.280 --> 38:59.114
maybe it was you
but different.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.839
But then when you forgot
who I was again,

39:03.920 --> 39:05.912
it wasn't hard
to figure it out from there.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.233
How come you never
said anything?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.150
I don't know.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.920
We were hanging out.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.712
We were spending
time together.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.997
It felt like we were
finally getting close.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.797
I guess I didn't want
that to stop.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.674
How come you two
weren't close before?

39:54.120 --> 39:55.120
What did he do?

39:59.160 --> 40:00.514
He didn't do anything.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.160
It was me.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.913
I wasn't there for him.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.392
I didn't know
how to talk to him.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.993
I couldn't deal with what
he was going through, so I

40:18.720 --> 40:20.040
gave up

40:21.320 --> 40:22.320
and took off.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.318
That was part of the reason
why I came back.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.754
I wanted to fix things.

40:32.240 --> 40:36.029
But he was gone,
and you were here instead.

40:46.960 --> 40:47.960
Is he, uh...

40:50.040 --> 40:51.235
Is he okay?

40:57.520 --> 40:59.239
I made a safe place
for him.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.353
It's got everything
he ever wanted.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.080
Good.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
He deserves that.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.759
You know, even though
I bailed on him,

41:27.880 --> 41:31.078
there's not a day that goes by
that I don't think about him.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.034
I really miss him.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.712
I'm gonna go
get the nurse.

41:59.880 --> 42:02.236
Fucking hospital.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.720
Shitty as it's always been.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.200
Darlene.

42:17.760 --> 42:18.760
I'm wrong.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.280
He doesn't have everything.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.909
And even though I'm only
a part of him...

42:47.120 --> 42:49.760
I want you to know I love you.

43:44.640 --> 43:45.835
<i>Hello, friend.</i>

43:47.400 --> 43:49.676
<i>God, that's always been lame,
hasn't it?</i>

43:52.120 --> 43:54.589
<i>Sorry I never came up
with a better name for you.</i>

43:56.200 --> 43:58.396
<i>Then again,
I don't even have a name.</i>

44:00.440 --> 44:03.160
<i>Just a guy trying to play God
without permission.</i>

44:43.080 --> 44:46.198
You told me once that this
would be a black void,

44:47.000 --> 44:48.593
absolute nothingness.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.115
Is that true?

44:54.640 --> 44:56.393
We'll always be
part of him, kiddo.

45:06.440 --> 45:08.376
<i>This whole time,
I thought changing the world</i>

45:08.400 --> 45:09.959
<i>was something you did,</i>

45:10.640 --> 45:12.233
<i>an act you performed,</i>

45:12.960 --> 45:14.440
<i>something you fought for.</i>

45:15.960 --> 45:18.077
<i>I don't know if that's
true anymore.</i>

45:19.760 --> 45:22.753
<i>What if changing the world
was just about being here,</i>

45:23.400 --> 45:27.679
<i>by showing up no matter how many times
we get told we don't belong,</i>

45:28.720 --> 45:32.111
<i>by staying true even when
we're shamed into being false,</i>

45:33.360 --> 45:35.750
<i>by believing in ourselves
even when we're told</i>

45:35.840 --> 45:37.115
<i>we're too different?</i>

45:38.120 --> 45:39.839
<i>And if we all held on to that,</i>

45:40.960 --> 45:43.794
<i>if we refuse to budge
and fall in line,</i>

45:44.800 --> 45:47.076
<i>if we stood our ground
for long enough,</i>

45:47.160 --> 45:48.435
<i>just maybe...</i>

45:50.880 --> 45:53.349
<i>The world can't help
but change around us.</i>

45:57.320 --> 45:59.118
<i>Even though we'll be gone,</i>

45:59.200 --> 46:01.237
<i>it's like Mr. Robot said.</i>

46:02.040 --> 46:04.714
<i>We'll always be a part

46:05.640 --> 46:07.359
<i>And we'll be the best part,</i>

46:08.360 --> 46:10.795

46:17.240 --> 46:19.277
<i>And who wouldn't be proud
of that?</i>

48:51.440 --> 48:54.956
<i>Facing tempests of dust</i>

48:55.040 --> 48:59.273
<i>I'll fight until the end</i>

49:03.840 --> 49:05.672

49:05.760 --> 49:08.992
<i>Raise up and dance with me</i>

49:18.120 --> 49:20.271
