WEBVTT

00:10.302 --> 00:11.762
<i>Best wedding ever!</i>

00:18.519 --> 00:21.272
How's it feel waking up
in a cockpit, eh, Iceman?

00:21.272 --> 00:24.150
It's, uh, not the bathhouse
fantasy you'd think, Wayne.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.444
But thank you for
letting me crash here.

00:26.444 --> 00:29.155
I really... I couldn't take
any more camping in the rain.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.365
Michelada? Huh?

00:31.866 --> 00:33.951
Ah...

00:34.952 --> 00:37.329
How did we end up here,
eh, J-dawg?

00:37.329 --> 00:39.206
You, homeless and lonely.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.042
Me, the roguish captain
of the Mansplane,

00:42.042 --> 00:44.044
just pining after his lost love.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.046
Wayner...

00:47.173 --> 00:48.466
Did you ever have a question

00:48.466 --> 00:50.509
that you were really afraid
to ask Jayne?

00:50.509 --> 00:53.095
I was always afraid
to ask Jaynie questions.

00:53.095 --> 00:56.682
Questions lead to answers,
and answers, they can be scary.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.559
That's just not quite
what I meant, but...

00:58.559 --> 01:01.103
I found this
amazing new guide to life.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.646
"Seaplane Owner's Manual".

01:02.646 --> 01:04.190
That's an instruction
manual, buddy.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.066
Bingo, brother. That's right.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.068
Relationships are
just like flying a plane.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.030
Found out I've been
on autopilot my whole marriage.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.573
If I want to
get it back on track,

01:12.573 --> 01:13.908
I gotta take controls myself...

01:13.908 --> 01:16.327
...
wait for Jaynie's signal.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.037
But what if Jayne
did something bad?

01:18.037 --> 01:20.164
Like, I'm talking
something real bad, Wayne.

01:20.164 --> 01:21.916
Like... like criminal bad.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.710
It's all about
perspective, right?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.505
For instance, people
used to think that mixing

01:27.505 --> 01:29.924
tomato juice and beer
was a bad idea.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.384
Not Mexicans, uh-uh.
And thanks to them,

01:32.384 --> 01:34.595
we now enjoy
a delicious breakfast beverage.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.388
Yeah, that's true.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.266
Or bicycles in the water.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.684
Nope, that's a bad idea.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.687
Jaynie is living proof
that a body built

01:43.687 --> 01:46.273
by Aqua Spin, never a bad idea.
She's a rocket.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.608
Yeah, I did see her bikes

01:47.608 --> 01:49.318
all stacked up over there
this morning.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.862
Yeah, she's logging
some hours for her Level Two,

01:51.862 --> 01:54.031
so she's offering
a freebie today.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.324
Whole lake's invited.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.575
Oh.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.285
If I help Jaynie level up,

01:58.285 --> 02:01.121
pretty sure we can get
our marriage back on the level.

02:04.875 --> 02:10.756
Hey, 90% of crashes
are communication failure.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.550
Gotta listen to your co-pilot.

02:13.676 --> 02:15.970
God, Wayne.
That's actually really smart.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.764
I just got to get
Riley's side of the story.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.059
Hey, let me get you
some breakfast.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.062
I got a couple of egg
sandwiches in the glove box.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.482
<i>♪ ... On the other side ♪</i>

02:28.482 --> 02:30.401
Aw, they've gone bad.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.695
<i>♪ Can you feel it? ♪</i>

02:32.695 --> 02:36.782
<i>♪ It goes something like
"You've only got one life" ♪</i>

02:36.782 --> 02:39.201
Wait, wait, wait,
I wouldn't go over there.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.703
Ivy's super pissed.

02:40.703 --> 02:42.496
You planted Dogwood
instead of Spruce.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.248
How am I supposed
to tell them apart?

02:44.248 --> 02:45.708
By its bark?

02:45.708 --> 02:47.793
Yeah, your puns are
getting kind of tired.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.545
You should really branch out.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.756
Hey, um,
any chance some friends and I

02:52.756 --> 02:54.800
could swing by your place,
use your washing machine?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.218
Don't you just wash in the lake?

02:56.802 --> 02:57.803
Because we're cavemen?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.891
No, it's just there's only
one laundromat in town,

03:01.891 --> 03:03.642
and it kind of sucks spending

03:03.642 --> 03:05.394
your entire day off
waiting for a machine.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.229
Well, I only
have the one washer,

03:07.229 --> 03:09.565
and, you know,
the dryer takes forever, so...

03:09.565 --> 03:13.027
Okay, we can make a day of it.
Bring beers, snacks.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.778
Krusty Jake's got a projector.

03:14.778 --> 03:18.574
It could be like
a laundry party.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.911
Oh, I would,
but it's not really my cottage.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.412
It's probably cool
if just you come.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.123
- But any more, and...
- It's cool.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.958
I can just do it in town.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.669
- Sorry.
- No, no, no worries.

03:30.669 --> 03:31.712
Catch you by the campfire later?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.464
- Definitely.
- Cool.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.931
Hey, this where
we get our checks?

03:44.183 --> 03:46.560
Cool. You know, I finally feel
like I'm starting to get

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
the hang of this thing.
That's it? What the fuck?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.814
No, I must have planted, like,
over 400 trees yesterday.

03:50.814 --> 03:54.944
Average is over 1,000.
It's 25 cents per tree planted,

03:54.944 --> 03:58.155
minus camp cost, transpo.
So that's what's left.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.991
Man, I did not ask the right
questions in my interview.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.203
I have to send the numbers to
the bean counters each week.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.288
And you're
not making quota. So...

04:06.288 --> 04:07.623
So you're going to fire me?

04:07.623 --> 04:10.000
Is that internship
still available?

04:15.089 --> 04:17.466
Um, what is happening
right now?

04:17.466 --> 04:20.719
I told my mom to make her own
tapas for the board meeting.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.138
It's a little something else
I've been working on.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.431
I made an energy drink

04:24.431 --> 04:26.350
I want to test out
at Aqua Spin today.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.394
Could be my second
career game changer.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.980
Oh, I'm off
green smoothies for the week.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.232
Miguel has me on
fruit and seeds.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.900
But you know,
I know people who can

04:34.900 --> 04:36.402
test and market that for you.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.028
But could they come up
with a great name

04:38.028 --> 04:39.697
like Lin-sterine?

04:40.239 --> 04:43.075
- "Victor-E"?
- Damn, that's better. Wait.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.494
"From the rink, to the tee,

04:45.494 --> 04:47.079
feel the rush of Victor-E."

04:48.247 --> 04:51.166
Are you still golfing with
Alec from Mohebbi Sports Labs?

04:51.166 --> 04:54.545
Mmm, not much. That sweet little
gerbil man can barely break 80.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.547
Set up a game.
I need him to test

04:56.547 --> 04:58.132
some samples from my mother.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.010
You think Mimsy's on the juice?

05:01.010 --> 05:02.428
I think if I can get
her tested,

05:02.428 --> 05:03.804
I can find out
if she's really sick.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.806
My fuck-it list failed.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.766
I need hard data to prove
that she's faking it.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.518
Yeah, but how are you
going to get the DNA

05:09.518 --> 05:12.104
hat-trick of saliva,
blood AND urine?

05:12.104 --> 05:13.564
Two down, one to go.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.399
It's better if you don't ask.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.861
So, I've got a few motivated
buyers for the Boathouse land.

05:18.861 --> 05:22.489
It is prime beachfront, baby,
so it'll be a blood bath.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.158
I love a blood bath.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.743
The money from the sale is

05:25.743 --> 05:26.994
the only way
that we can rebuild.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.537
We'll have to find a new plot.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.539
- Something cute and cozy.
- You mean small.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.499
Well, what choice do we have?

05:32.499 --> 05:35.794
I can't keep running
the Boathouse out of my cottage

05:35.794 --> 05:37.838
and none of you Lake Laugh
Lovers are stepping up.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.381
But why rebuild?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.884
Why not split the money
between Boathouse members?

05:41.884 --> 05:44.094
I mean, think what
you can do with that cash.

05:44.094 --> 05:48.682
A new boat,
a new dock, a new wardrobe.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.143
- I second that.
- <i>Nej!</i>

05:51.143 --> 05:53.520
We need a Boathouse
to set fair rules

05:53.520 --> 05:54.730
and to protect the lake.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.523
Well, who's going to protect us

05:56.523 --> 05:58.484
from Whoreen's cardigan?

05:58.484 --> 06:00.527
I say take the money and run.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.696
It is all moot without quorum.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.615
Well, Riley
will be at Aqua Spin,

06:04.615 --> 06:06.241
so I will get his vote there.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.787
And I am counting on
all of you to be there, too.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.246
Okay? Meeting adjourned.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.629
Oh, I will see you
at Aqua Spin.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.340
- No.
- Somebody needs to tell Ulrika

06:21.340 --> 06:23.008
she can't go strapless
when she leeches.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.843
That's not from leeches.
She's wet-cupping.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.720
I don't even want
to know what that is.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.099
It's good for blood flow,
inflammation, detox.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.851
You prick the skin before
applying the suction cups,

06:32.851 --> 06:35.187
and the vacuum seal
slurps up the blood.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.564
We used to do it on
Tequila Tuesdays before a game.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.442
There's my hat trick.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.595
Shit. Shit.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.805
Shit.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.934
Oh, fuck no.

07:14.518 --> 07:15.727
No, no.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.066
Nope, can't make me
go back in there.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.195
- Oh, thank God.
- Justin.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.156
Shit, I thought you were Riley.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.451
Oh, man. You're not sniffing
his stuff again, are you?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.787
It was one time, kink shamer.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.958
Put that down. Come here.
I gotta show you something.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.335
The Quads shot this

07:40.335 --> 07:42.629
right before the fireworks
went off at the Boathouse.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.174
<i>Hey!</i>

07:46.800 --> 07:48.010
Look at that.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.637
That's Riley's plaid shirt.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.765
You think Riley
burned down the Boathouse?

07:53.765 --> 07:55.934
Well, it's clearly this shirt.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.352
Justin, it's clearly A shirt.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.896
And when the evidence
is that obvious,

07:58.896 --> 08:00.480
it's never actually
that person.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.524
Did you learn nothing
from Horatio Kane?

08:02.524 --> 08:04.526
I'm more of a Mariska Hargitay
<i>SVU</i> kind of girl, actually.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.570
But Riley and I never talk
crime franchises at home.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.989
Okay, well, both always
rule out the other suspects

08:08.989 --> 08:10.407
before taking someone in.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.744
Oh, God, that just
seems like so much work.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.580
Justin, you need to be
a million percent sure

08:16.580 --> 08:19.750
it's Riley before you accuse
him, or you two are done-done.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.335
Like, we may as well
pack up and leave.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.878
Which, honestly, may be
the best thing right now.

08:22.878 --> 08:25.631
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up, Missy Marple.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.090
Who's working
another motive now?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.259
I think I'm getting fired.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.677
You're being paranoid.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.304
You're the hardest worker
that I know.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.514
Yeah, and I made less than $200

08:34.514 --> 08:36.058
working 10 hours a day
for a week.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.601
Wow, you did not ask
the right questions

08:37.601 --> 08:38.727
at your job interview.

08:39.895 --> 08:43.065
I ruined my life
for a cute boy. Again.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.524
Hey...

08:44.524 --> 08:46.693
That's the only reason
to ruin your life.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.988
Plus, there's a solution:
make friends with your boss.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.324
I've stayed in so many jobs
I was dangerously

08:52.324 --> 08:54.493
unqualified for because
I'm super fun to be around.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.662
- Did you sleep with the boss?
- No. Yes.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.705
One time, kink shamer.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.627
Wait, that's actually
not a bad idea.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.003
Oh.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.422
Thanks, Justin.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.092
Yeah, okay. You're welcome.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.012
Wait, you're not gonna
sleep with your boss, are you?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.224
I've got a surprise for us.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.810
- Oh, sweetie, honestly, I...
- I booked a spa day.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.478
I know you prefer
to manage your pain

09:21.478 --> 09:23.730
- with holistic medicine.
- Or narcotics in a pinch.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.941
So I booked us
deep tissue massages.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.318
- They'll be here in an hour.
- What a relief.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.820
You know,
you've been so desperate

09:29.820 --> 09:31.697
for attention this week,
I was actually

09:31.697 --> 09:34.658
pricing flights to Lisbon
for a little me time.

09:36.034 --> 09:39.788
You'd be so easy to like
if you didn't try so hard.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.249
Massage.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.673
Hey, how's it hanging, boyos?

09:49.673 --> 09:51.091
Lovejoy,
what are you doing here?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.676
Aw, you couldn't keep me away, Wayner.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.927
Love water sports.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.305
Maureen, too.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.515
Really strong stream, boy.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.768
Also, I just...

10:01.768 --> 10:04.313
I'm really having to
build back up my lung capacity

10:04.313 --> 10:07.274
after inhaling so much smoke
at the wedding, you know?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.151
You ran off before
the Boathouse caught fire.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.986
Yes, I did.
Yeah, but then the vaping,

10:10.986 --> 10:12.821
oh, the vaping
got out of control.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.865
I think it was the stress
of being unjustly accused

10:14.865 --> 10:16.783
and maintaining
an innocent waistline.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.453
But back on the patch,
feeling good.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.996
How are you guys doing?
How are your lungs?

10:20.996 --> 10:22.622
How much smoke did you inhale?
Were you, like,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.583
this close or this far away
from the Boathouse

10:24.583 --> 10:26.918
- when it caught fire?
- I was keeping Opal away.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.837
Between the hairspray
and fabric glue,

10:28.837 --> 10:30.088
kid was a fireball
waiting to happen.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.465
- Yeah, that tracks.
- Yeah.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.550
I was hiding from Claire.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.514
I'm a bit of a snack ever since
I've become a bachelor

10:39.514 --> 10:41.725
and, uh, pretty sure
Claire wanted a nibble.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.061
- Okay.
- Oh, I told her no.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.771
The only woman that I have

10:45.771 --> 10:48.231
meaningless sex with
is my wife.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.734
I don't blame her, though.
Got the pheromones of a lynx.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.862
All right, Body Breakers!
Aqua Spin starts in five.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.030
- Justin?
- I know.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.448
I know I wasn't invited, Jayne.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.784
No, it's fine.
Maisy and Mimsy bailed,

10:58.784 --> 11:01.286
and I need students
for my hours to qualify.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.121
Just stay away from Riley.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.790
- Fine.
- Before we get started,

11:04.790 --> 11:06.458
I'm testing out
a new sports drink.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.586
It's all natural, gluten free,
full of electrolytes.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.962
Test it out.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.297
Tell me your honest opinion.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.841
Mm, I like it. Is it hemp?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.676
With kelp. I call it Help.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.887
And who doesn't need a little
of that from their friends?

11:18.887 --> 11:20.514
Am I right?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.099
Yeah.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.144
Jesus.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.940
Wow! All right,
you dick holes, let's ride.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.900
- Okay.
- All right.

11:31.900 --> 11:32.984
Let's go, Jaynie!

11:32.984 --> 11:34.611
Let's go, tadpoles!

11:44.204 --> 11:46.915
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

11:47.499 --> 11:48.542
Okay.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.337
You guys, I said a few friends,
not Party-gras.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.005
I told you it was
too many people.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.550
Word got out
about my laundry connect.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.802
I could ask them to go.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.597
No. No, it's cool.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.807
You don't have to do this.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.308
Laundry parties aren't a thing.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.727
So let's make
a new tradition, then.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.563
Okay.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.565
Sweet. Sweet.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.150
Laundry's on, sluts.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.569
- Oh...
- It's a tree planter thing.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.987
It's just something
we call each other.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.572
Oh, okay. Cool.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.908
Do you want some chips,
you dirty slut?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.411
It's just slut.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.746
Right.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.710
Ulrika just set up
a circus tent on the lawn.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.253
She's self-licensed in Sweden.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.713
Ulrika's our masseuse?

12:34.713 --> 12:36.673
Not just massage, cupping.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.550
Wet cupping. Cup of sugaring.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.552
She did wonders for Victor's
nervous lactation.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.262
<i>Halla!</i>

12:42.679 --> 12:44.264
- Who is ready to sweat?
- Sweat?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.433
No, we ordered
the wet cupping package.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.436
Sauna first. Relaxes the body,
brings blood to the surface.

12:49.436 --> 12:53.148
Oh, honey.
A sauna sounds nice, dear.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.816
Maisy, you should come to.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.318
Oh, yes.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.862
It would help
with that water weight.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.572
It's the salt in her diet.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.700
Let's do this.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.787
I think it's called genetics.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.001
<i>♪ Wine mixer, mix it up
with my elixir ♪</i>

13:13.001 --> 13:15.128
<i>♪ Overlookin' the ocean,
I'm hopin' I see flipper ♪</i>

13:15.128 --> 13:17.130
<i>♪ Young Filipe movin' like... ♪</i>

13:17.130 --> 13:19.341
- Hey.
- About that record...

13:21.468 --> 13:24.137
Whoa, haven't seen
this side of you.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.348
Well, it's not like
I have work tomorrow.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.100
Actually, that's up to Ivy.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.686
What? You're gonna fire her?

13:31.686 --> 13:34.231
- It's not up to me.
- It's cool.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.775
Even if I get shit-canned,
no hard feelings.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.401
We keep it clean
at laundry parties.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.029
So...

13:42.239 --> 13:44.199
How about a drink?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.243
Since you're not on
the clock anymore.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.746
- Thanks, slut.
- Ah.

14:00.048 --> 14:03.051
Welcome to the first Aqua Spin
class of this season.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.680
I am Jayne
and ready to bring the Payne.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.516
Special shoutout to Riley
for sticking around,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.059
even though a certain someone

14:11.059 --> 14:12.769
is replacing
some last minute wash-outs.

14:12.769 --> 14:13.979
All right.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.650
Whoa. Let's do this.
You're at one.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.194
I want you to crank it to two.
And you're minnows.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.155
You're minnows. You're minnows.
You're minnows. Now, three.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.367
And tadpole,
a tadpole, a tadpole.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.953
Yo, girl. Hey, girl.

14:30.328 --> 14:34.165
Hey. Hear you were hot
for Wayne at the wedding.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.876
Yeah, sure. I wanted a piece
of that Klondike Bar.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.128
He's fair game now.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.297
But the sex-falcon
turned me down.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.924
How about you, Saggy B?

14:42.924 --> 14:45.468
Where were you when
the Boathouse burned down?

14:45.468 --> 14:47.220
I got a better question.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.432
Why are these bikes
in the water?

14:50.932 --> 14:53.852
If you're thinking someone
burned down the Boathouse,

14:53.852 --> 14:55.520
smart money's on Whoreen.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.188
For God's sake, Claire.
She's been with your dad

14:57.188 --> 14:58.898
for 20 years. Maybe move on.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.443
People like her stop at nothing
to get what they want.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.612
Move those tails,
tadpoles!

15:04.362 --> 15:08.158
I am here to put a Presi-DENT
in your waistline.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.285
Oh, Jayne.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.124
Whoa, that did not feel good.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.876
Keep it up, Jaynie.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.210
Doing great, Pancake.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.129
Keep it up, bullfrogs.

15:22.339 --> 15:25.216
I will be back in a jiff.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.595
I'm gonna go see if
she needs any help, you guys.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.141
I think she's had enough.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.562
You are gonna love cupping.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.565
Victor says it really makes
you feel like a new woman.

15:40.565 --> 15:43.026
I'd feel like
a richer woman if the board

15:43.026 --> 15:45.320
would split the money
from the Boathouse sale.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.323
I don't understand the lake's
obsession with that place.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.367
The Boathouse follows in
the ancient tradition

15:50.367 --> 15:52.035
of Swedish mead halls.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.871
A place for the village
to spread lewd gossip about

15:54.871 --> 15:57.040
their neighbours
over unpasteurized beer.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.459
There were also programs
for families,

15:59.459 --> 16:01.628
child care, elder care.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.881
Honestly, it's been
so much more enjoyable

16:04.881 --> 16:06.257
around the lake this summer

16:06.257 --> 16:08.593
without the Boathouse
policing us.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.471
You need a firmer grip.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.972
It takes a strong hand to make

16:12.972 --> 16:15.016
cold blood rise to the surface.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.768
Let it all out.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.896
Let all your secrets out.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.773
That's right, Jayne.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.818
You spent years
in Maisy's shadow,

17:06.818 --> 17:09.279
lusting after
that Boathouse throne.

17:09.279 --> 17:13.867
And then first, you got rid of
Wayne, then Maisy, then Ulrika.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.703
Yeah, but you didn't count
on the insurance not paying out

17:16.703 --> 17:18.580
or having to host
the Boathouse at your place.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.082
But it was a small
price to pay, wasn't it,

17:21.082 --> 17:23.042
for that tidy commission
on the land sale?

17:23.668 --> 17:25.462
It's true.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.589
What? What?

17:27.589 --> 17:31.259
I wanted to be Boathouse
president so bad.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.677
Oh, that's it, Pancake.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.304
You let it all out.

17:34.304 --> 17:38.516
I bumped Whoreen's canasta
for your wedding

17:38.516 --> 17:41.811
to guilt Maisy into changing
real estate agents.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.521
But she doesn't care.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.733
She's just obsessed
with her mom.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.027
Okay.

17:49.819 --> 17:53.531
The presidency means nothing
without the Boathouse.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.868
My ruthless ambition
burned everything down.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.919
You got some kelp
in your hair.

18:12.926 --> 18:13.885
Hey.

18:13.885 --> 18:14.761
Hey.

18:17.222 --> 18:20.558
Ivy likes to front
a mean game, but...

18:21.267 --> 18:23.478
she's never actually
fired anyone before.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.604
Hmmm.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.732
I'm sure you can convince her

18:27.732 --> 18:29.943
to vouch for you
to head office.

18:32.195 --> 18:36.157
You sang an acoustic
duet together, so...

18:36.157 --> 18:38.368
there's no way
she can fire you now.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.661
Yeah.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.336
You got this.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.886
Can I get a round
of applause for Jaynie, huh?

18:56.886 --> 18:59.722
For reaching her Level Two
Aqua Spin certification.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.307
- Yes.
- Way to go, babe.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.351
Sorry, Jayner.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.978
I'd think my drink fermented.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.522
Crazy that pro hockey
doesn't make you a chemist.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.484
Come on, Justin.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.736
Hey. Can we talk?

19:16.364 --> 19:19.200
Do you remember that thing that
I said the other day about, um,

19:19.200 --> 19:21.703
someone burning down
the Boathouse on purpose?

19:22.579 --> 19:24.330
Well, see, I thought
that if I could prove it,

19:24.330 --> 19:26.249
that you might forgive me.
And I...

19:26.249 --> 19:29.252
I know now that that's, um...
that was really stupid.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.671
- Real dumb.
- But Riley, somebody did

19:31.671 --> 19:34.424
use our wedding fireworks
to start the fire.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.718
Any proof?

19:36.718 --> 19:37.802
Just the missing fireworks

19:37.802 --> 19:39.137
and an unsinged box.

19:39.721 --> 19:40.930
But then when I saw the Quads

19:40.930 --> 19:42.515
post that
shitty meme of you, I...

19:42.515 --> 19:44.767
I had this idea.
And I thought, well...

19:44.767 --> 19:46.728
they caught that, maybe
they caught something else.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.396
And, um, they did.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.942
Billie told me to CSI
everybody, so I checked alibis,

19:52.942 --> 19:55.069
dress sizes,
I worked my sunglass flip.

19:56.738 --> 20:00.408
Riley, if you did it
because I ran, I get it.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.493
I do. I'm just...
I'm worried about you.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.829
It's Claire.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.706
That's your shirt, Riley.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.250
Hey, Claire, come here a sec.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.424
- Is this you?
- Nope.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.885
See, Riley, I would not have
shown you that video if I had...

20:18.885 --> 20:21.179
It's Mimsy. She was cold.
I loaned her my shirt.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.183
I did not ask Mimsy.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.896
Being accused of arson is going
to make leaving a lot easier.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.398
Leaving?
What do you mean, leaving?

20:32.774 --> 20:35.860
My new Hit and Run series
got a showcase in Paris.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.236
In Paris?

20:38.279 --> 20:40.531
Oh, my God. That's...

20:41.866 --> 20:43.284
That's like the art
capital of the world.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.994
It's Paris, Ontario.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.120
That's...

20:46.663 --> 20:47.622
the Paris of...

20:48.706 --> 20:49.832
of Ontario.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.293
I leave tomorrow.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.546
So I'm going to crash
at the Gas Go,

20:55.546 --> 20:58.174
but you can stay at the cabin
until Billie's contract is up.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.677
After that,
I don't want to see you again.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.054
Riley.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.597
Hey, Jayner.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.350
I vote we sell the land,
split the money.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.394
My wedding gift to the lake.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.278
That was so stupid.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.034
Plane down.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.077
Sorry.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.916
Victor was right.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.960
This is absolute heaven.

21:34.669 --> 21:38.297
I can just feel the toxins
pouring out of me.

21:38.965 --> 21:39.841
Big buildup.

21:41.551 --> 21:44.053
I'm sorry.
This is so embarrassing.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.306
It's just the sight of blood
really makes me dizzy.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.684
Oh, I thought
it might arouse you.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.769
Sharks are usually
excited by blood.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.604
Could I have some water?

21:54.105 --> 21:56.566
Boar urine might help
settle your stomach better.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.109
Yeah, water is fine.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.236
Ah, good.
You will need your strength.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.320
You are next.

22:06.868 --> 22:09.662
Oh, Mom, don't move. One of
your cups is coming loose.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.139
Having fun?

22:28.139 --> 22:31.434
I am. Don't let the resting
butch face fool you.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.770
Wow. And she puns too.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.354
You guys really are related.

22:37.482 --> 22:41.778
Hey, are you into my brother?
I'm kind of getting a vibe.

22:41.778 --> 22:44.405
A vibe? No, nuh-uh,
it's totally platonic.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.491
Like, uh, like tree-plant-onic.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.993
Oh, God. Did I catch it too?

22:48.993 --> 22:50.578
Am I a pun zombie now?
Because you're gonna

22:50.578 --> 22:52.371
have to kill me, Ivy.
Please, just, like, kill me.

22:52.371 --> 22:56.167
Next time. You get a free pass
for boosting crew moral today.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.087
Does that free pass extend
to next week maybe?

22:59.962 --> 23:01.089
Uh-uh.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.299
Oh God, I'm getting fired?

23:03.299 --> 23:05.384
No, no, no, I don't get fired.
I've never even been fired.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.136
- It's okay.
- It's okay? I just gave up

23:07.136 --> 23:08.930
a great job, my parents
are totally gonna hate me

23:08.930 --> 23:10.473
and I just screwed my shot
at a scholarship.

23:10.473 --> 23:11.849
But yeah, it's cool,
it's cool, it's cool.

23:11.849 --> 23:13.392
So you can't plant trees.

23:14.519 --> 23:18.731
You're smart, fun,
people like you.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.399
And...

23:27.406 --> 23:29.158
Uh, thanks for the party. Fire...

23:29.158 --> 23:30.993
Sorry about the firing thing.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.745
Oh, uh...

23:38.960 --> 23:42.463
Oh, darling,
I feel a thousand times better.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.674
- Thank you.
- You are so very welcome.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.803
And losing a little blood means
we only need half the gin.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.931
I'm going to go see
what delight Opal is

23:51.931 --> 23:53.724
masterminding in the kitchen.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.445
- Hello.
- Oh.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.197
Why the sad face?

24:08.197 --> 24:10.158
It's my mom's idea
of a sick joke.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.326
But I will have the last laugh.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.162
Oh, you gonna
bake her into a pie

24:14.162 --> 24:15.621
or skin her puppies
to make a coat?

24:15.621 --> 24:17.165
What brings you back here?

24:17.165 --> 24:18.916
I just came to get
the last of my stuff.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.210
How's riding the Wayne plane?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.963
Uh, I'm not. I'm, um,
back at the Murder Cabin.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.882
You got Riley to forgive you?

24:25.882 --> 24:28.050
Oh, your jaw must be so sore.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.512
Riley went to Paris, Ontario.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.723
But who knows?

24:33.723 --> 24:35.725
Accusing him of torching
the Boathouse could inspire work

24:35.725 --> 24:37.101
that sends him to actual Paris.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.021
You thought Riley
set fire to the Boathouse?

24:40.021 --> 24:41.480
Man, you are getting desperate.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.151
No, the Quads filmed someone
in plaid sneaking into

24:45.151 --> 24:46.819
the Boathouse right before
the fireworks went off.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.654
And I thought it was Riley,
but it was actually

24:48.654 --> 24:50.740
just your mom in lesbian drag.
You can read all about it

24:50.740 --> 24:52.033
in the holiday email. Goodbye.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.326
Can I see the footage?

24:53.326 --> 24:54.785
No, Maisy, I'm done with it.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.204
Ask the Quads.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.788
Arson is a monkey's paw.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.624
It's the path to crazy.

24:59.624 --> 25:02.627
Walk away or end up a sad

25:02.627 --> 25:05.046
single cautionary tale
like me.

25:17.934 --> 25:18.768
Hey.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.021
So, judging from
the apocalypse outside,

25:22.021 --> 25:24.398
I'd say the party
was a complete success.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.860
So what happened?
You win your boss over?

25:27.860 --> 25:30.238
Nope, got fired.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.532
Oh, shit.
Billie, I'm so sorry.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.788
Something happened, Justin.

25:39.789 --> 25:42.625
Something
I've never done, and...

25:43.292 --> 25:44.418
- I...
- What?

25:45.378 --> 25:46.796
What, honey? What happened?

25:47.546 --> 25:48.631
I...

25:50.049 --> 25:51.550
I sang "Wonderwall".

25:51.550 --> 25:54.553
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.139
It's okay. It's okay.

25:58.432 --> 26:00.434
It happens to us all eventually.
