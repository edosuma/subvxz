00:07.758 --> 00:09.493
[Narrator] Reaching the
other side of the world

00:09.517 --> 00:12.034
is a dream, many of us share.

00:12.068 --> 00:15.551
But when we fly over, do we
forget how to travel through?

00:19.413 --> 00:23.793
Mexico City, North
America's largest Metropolis

00:25.000 --> 00:27.758
to ushuaia, Argentina.

00:27.793 --> 00:30.310
The most southerly
city in the world.

00:30.344 --> 00:33.137
Twenty hours by plane,

00:33.172 --> 00:36.206
but could you travel the
length of Latin America

00:36.241 --> 00:40.551
at ground level and all
for the price of the airfare?

00:40.586 --> 00:42.482
[Man] What we
got ourselves into?

00:42.517 --> 00:45.931
[Narrator] Five pairs of ordinary
brits are attempting just that.

00:46.275 --> 00:47.896
Let's go.

00:47.931 --> 00:50.896
[Narrator] They will cover
over 25,000 kilometers...

00:52.379 --> 00:54.896
Moments like this, you'll
remember for the rest of your life.

00:54.931 --> 00:58.448
[Narrator] In a demanding
and challenging race,

00:58.482 --> 01:00.758
which soars high into the andes,

01:00.793 --> 01:03.172
crosses vast deserts

01:03.206 --> 01:06.965
and navigate some of the
world's most volatile regions.

01:07.965 --> 01:09.586
Walking over with a gun.

01:10.724 --> 01:12.310
[Narrator] Have they
got what it takes?

01:12.344 --> 01:15.862
Got no Google maps,
got no mom, got nothing.

01:15.896 --> 01:17.206
[Narrator] Both physically...

01:17.241 --> 01:18.493
[Woman] Someone
call an ambulance.

01:18.517 --> 01:19.896
[Narrator] And emotionally...

01:21.172 --> 01:22.620
We need a miracle
to get out of here.

01:24.103 --> 01:25.517
[Narrator] The
rewards are great.

01:25.551 --> 01:28.655
- This is crazy good.
- This has brought us closer together.

01:30.172 --> 01:33.000
[Narrator] The first team to
the finish line will claim the prize

01:33.034 --> 01:34.724
of twenty thousand pounds.

01:36.241 --> 01:39.724
In a race war across the world.

01:39.758 --> 01:43.551
Excitement, adventure, trauma.

01:44.965 --> 01:45.965
Oh, my god.

01:49.620 --> 01:52.620
- [Narrator] Previously...
- [Man] Bye Argentina.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.275
[Narrator] The
race entered Brazil.

01:54.310 --> 01:56.103
[Woman] Oh, look at that!

01:56.137 --> 01:57.517
[Narrator] Dom opened up...

01:57.551 --> 02:00.034
What I struggle
with is vulnerability...

02:00.068 --> 02:02.010
'Cause you don't communicate,
that's your problem.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.034
We're in Brazil.

02:03.758 --> 02:04.838
[Narrator] Jo bit the bullet.

02:04.862 --> 02:07.827
We are low on budget,
you need to work.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.862
[Narrator] So, Sam
could hit a sweet spot.

02:09.896 --> 02:13.448
Seeing him loving it,
that's the biggest gift.

02:13.482 --> 02:16.724
Let's make sure we go home with
real memories rather than regrets.

02:16.758 --> 02:18.586
[Narrator] While on
a roll, Jen and Rob...

02:18.620 --> 02:20.517
Potentially have a
chance to overtake,

02:20.551 --> 02:23.275
[narrator] Gave emon and
jamiul a run for their money.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.482
We're going so fast.

02:25.517 --> 02:27.700
[Narrator] But the boys
clinched first place in this race.

02:27.724 --> 02:30.137
This phase made me realize
it's a big world out there.

02:30.172 --> 02:32.689
I'm just a little dot
in the spectrum.

02:32.724 --> 02:34.148
[Narrator] And the
other two teams...

02:34.172 --> 02:37.000
I'm pretty sure the island's
literally there and we can't cross.

02:37.034 --> 02:38.758
[Narrator] Were
left high and dry.

02:38.793 --> 02:41.896
We've raced so hard
this leg, just gutted.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.689
- [Speaking foreign language]
- [Lizzie] We're going to run.

02:55.724 --> 02:57.241
Let's take a canoe
across the bay.

03:00.758 --> 03:01.758
[Lizzie] Run, dom.

03:03.344 --> 03:07.379
[Speaking foreign language]

03:10.793 --> 03:13.554
[Lizzie] Come on, dom. It's like
they're going to be faster in a kayak,

03:13.724 --> 03:15.103
so we need to go.

03:15.137 --> 03:17.586
[Narrator] Arriving on ilha
grande neck and neck...

03:17.620 --> 03:19.896
[Sam] Oh, dom and Lizzie there.

03:19.931 --> 03:23.344
[Narrator] Two teams racing to
avoid being last to the checkpoint.

03:23.379 --> 03:26.448
- [Dom] Just put that last bit of extra effort in.
- [Lizzie] I am.

03:26.482 --> 03:28.482
- [Sam] There's dom and Liz.
- Oh, might beat them.

03:29.482 --> 03:31.551
[Lizzie] They're there.
No, this isn't funny.

03:33.206 --> 03:35.487
- [Lizzie] Can't see them.
- [Dom] Come on, let's just run.

03:37.965 --> 03:41.068
So glad we're doing
this rather than running.

03:41.103 --> 03:44.000
- [Lizzie] Can't breathe.
- [Dom] Come on, keep going.

03:44.034 --> 03:45.803
[Sam] I just see them
running across that beach.

03:45.827 --> 03:47.620
[Jo] That's bad.
They're gonna beat us.

03:47.655 --> 03:49.389
- [Sam] Do you reckon this is it?
- [Jo] Yeah.

03:49.413 --> 03:53.379
[Dom] We could still do
it, just got run. Come on.

03:53.413 --> 03:55.217
- [Sam] There they are.
- [Dom] Lizzie, come on!

03:55.241 --> 03:56.655
[Lizzie] I'm going.

04:00.517 --> 04:02.310
[Lizzie] I can't stand up.

04:05.068 --> 04:07.379
- [Dom] Third.
- [Lizzie] Oh, my god.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.275
- We didn't come fourth.
- [Both laughing]

04:10.310 --> 04:11.793
We came third.

04:11.827 --> 04:14.217
[Breathing heavily] Don't think
I've ever run so hard in my life.

04:14.241 --> 04:16.862
We've showed that
we can catch up.

04:16.896 --> 04:19.379
- [Lizzie] We do run!
- [Dom] We turn it on when it is needed.

04:19.413 --> 04:21.620
I know that there's always
something left in my tank.

04:21.655 --> 04:24.172
- [Jo] Brilliant.
- [Dom] This time we come fourth.

04:24.206 --> 04:27.275
Am I just touched?
Definitely deserved it this time.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.448
That was some
epic race, wasn't it?

04:29.482 --> 04:31.793
- I just want to take my clothes off.
- [Jo] Go on then.

04:39.965 --> 04:41.965
[Singing in foreign language]

04:44.896 --> 04:46.724
So, you've been
busy recently, mate?

04:46.758 --> 04:48.931
Yeah, it's been a bit
busy to be honest with you.

04:48.965 --> 04:53.413
[Dom] Myself, just been
passing through 3 countries

04:53.448 --> 04:56.000
with a bit of Peru,
bit of Columbia,

04:56.034 --> 04:57.137
Columbia's nice.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.551
- Been a lot of buses actually.
- A lot of buses, yeah?

05:01.827 --> 05:04.206
[Jen] It's absolutely
bloody freezing.

05:05.862 --> 05:11.379
[Narrator] After 17,000 kilometers,
the teams are just 24 hours apart.

05:11.413 --> 05:15.379
With two legs remaining
and Â£20,000 at stake,

05:15.413 --> 05:17.586
they're focusing in
on their game plans.

05:17.620 --> 05:20.286
[Jamiul] I feel like the next two legs are
going to be harder than any of the other.

05:20.310 --> 05:21.665
[Emon] Yeah, they're
going to be tough.

05:21.689 --> 05:25.862
We just need to keep our speed
going, to keep our first position.

05:25.896 --> 05:30.034
The closer we get, the more we talk
about it and the more I want to win.

05:30.068 --> 05:33.551
- [Jen] Why are we never first?
- [Rob] We'll have our chance at the end, hopefully.

05:33.586 --> 05:34.551
[Both laugh]

05:34.586 --> 05:37.862
[Jen] Our strategy
is the long game,

05:37.896 --> 05:41.379
having enough money
to get to the end first.

05:41.413 --> 05:43.965
I think our main rival
should be Jen and Rob

05:44.000 --> 05:46.103
because I think they've
got loads of money left.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.689
[Narrator] Budgets
were hit hard in Brazil.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.896
Jen and Rob have
24% of theirs remaining,

05:51.931 --> 05:55.068
while Jo and Sam
have just 10% left

05:55.103 --> 05:57.586
with a quarter of the
race still left to run.

05:58.655 --> 06:01.241
[Jo] The last leg took
hundreds of dollars.

06:01.275 --> 06:03.793
I think the next
couple of weeks...

06:03.827 --> 06:06.931
I think competition is
going to kick in a big way.

06:06.965 --> 06:10.310
Everyone is going to be
wanting to do as best they can.

06:10.344 --> 06:12.724
I just hope we
make it to the end.

06:12.758 --> 06:15.310
I would hate to drop out
'cause we've run out of money.

06:23.448 --> 06:24.724
[Narrator] 6:00 A.M.

06:24.758 --> 06:26.448
[Man] Right, Mr. Emon.

06:26.482 --> 06:29.862
[Narrator] The earliest boat to
mainland Brazil doesn't depart until eight,

06:29.896 --> 06:32.241
eating into emon and
jamiul's narrow lead.

06:32.275 --> 06:36.241
The seventh
checkpoint is mendoza.

06:36.275 --> 06:38.965
[Narrator] Mendoza,
in western Argentina,

06:39.000 --> 06:43.586
a Cosmopolitan city of elegant
tree lined avenues and plazas

06:43.620 --> 06:48.000
overlooked by aconcagua, the
highest mountain in the andes.

06:48.896 --> 06:51.068
Mendoza, here we come.

06:51.103 --> 06:54.931
[Narrator] To get there
are 3,300 kilometer journey

06:54.965 --> 06:59.413
through budget-crippling
Brazil and into Argentina.

06:59.448 --> 07:03.689
Teams will need all their ingenuity to
make their dwindling cash reserves last.

07:03.724 --> 07:07.689
We're going to have to be quite tactical
in the manner that we go about this.

07:07.724 --> 07:09.379
I think this leg is about money.

07:09.413 --> 07:12.689
About us making sure that we
have enough to get us to the end.

07:12.724 --> 07:16.172
- So, really and truly.
- I'd like to work as much possible.

07:16.206 --> 07:18.148
But on the flip side of it,
we need to get out of Brazil

07:18.172 --> 07:21.137
'cause obviously it's so
expensive as soon as possible,

07:21.172 --> 07:24.724
[narrator] The most direct route is to
cross straight from Brazil into Argentina

07:24.758 --> 07:27.137
and head west to mendoza.

07:27.172 --> 07:29.551
But taking a detour
through Uruguay

07:29.586 --> 07:31.724
could offer lucrative
job opportunities

07:31.758 --> 07:34.000
in the more affluent
coastal cities.

07:34.034 --> 07:36.620
[Emon] I know that Uruguay
is not as expensive as Brazil.

07:36.655 --> 07:39.137
- Maybe do some work there?
- For sure.

07:39.172 --> 07:42.034
Skipping Uruguay in this
leg might be a better option.

07:42.068 --> 07:45.482
This stage of the race, it's about
getting to the destinations quickly.

07:46.931 --> 07:49.206
[Jamiul] We'll be missing
out on a whole country.

07:49.241 --> 07:52.275
[Emon] Just by looking at the
map, it seems to be a faster route.

07:52.310 --> 07:54.172
From here, head all
way down to porto alegri.

07:54.206 --> 07:55.793
From there,
straight to Argentina.

07:55.827 --> 07:57.241
Then, we get to mendoza.

07:57.275 --> 07:59.103
I think that will
be our best option.

07:59.137 --> 08:00.931
- I hope so.
- Let's Scooby doo out.

08:03.103 --> 08:06.206
[Narrator] First, they
need to reach the mainland.

08:06.241 --> 08:07.838
[Emon] We need to ask
where we get tickets from.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.827
- Leave at 9 o'clock.
- [Emon] Anything before?

08:10.862 --> 08:12.620
Before, it's...

08:12.655 --> 08:13.931
- It's full?
- Yes.

08:13.965 --> 08:18.379
Oh, my god. We could get a
taxi boat but it'd be expensive.

08:18.413 --> 08:20.275
Can you find out how
much it is, actually?

08:20.310 --> 08:22.000
[Narrator] Despite
budget worries,

08:22.034 --> 08:26.655
emon's determined to stick to a strategy
to keep moving as fast as possible.

08:26.689 --> 08:28.655
So sends jamiul
to strike a deal.

08:29.931 --> 08:32.379
- Taxi to angra dos reis?
- Okay.

08:32.413 --> 08:35.310
- How much? How much?
- [Speaking foreign language]

08:35.344 --> 08:37.896
- Can you make it cheaper?
- Seventeen.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.586
[Speaking foreign language]

08:39.620 --> 08:42.310
[Narrator] Leaving the checkpoint,
just one hour behind the leaders.

08:42.344 --> 08:45.344
[Jen] Oh, I'm out of breath
already. Brace yourself, fatty.

08:45.379 --> 08:48.965
[Narrator] Jen and Rob have the
healthiest budget of all the teams.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.413
We need to speed up.

08:50.448 --> 08:52.769
I think we carry on doing what
we're doing. We're doing all right.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.769
- We're playing the longer game.
- That's not good enough.

08:54.793 --> 08:58.379
Everyone's done,
but people won legs

08:58.413 --> 09:01.103
but they spent a lot of
money to do so. We haven't.

09:01.137 --> 09:02.689
Yeah, I know but
it's no good losing

09:02.724 --> 09:04.320
when you got $500
leftover in your purse.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.551
Also, there's no point in not
being able to get to the end.

09:07.586 --> 09:09.389
No, I hear what you're
saying, but what I'm saying

09:09.413 --> 09:11.344
is I want to get
to the end first.

09:13.275 --> 09:15.793
- Taxi boat, 70 reals.
- Each, yeah?

09:15.827 --> 09:18.206
- Yeah, let's get a taxi boat.
- Yeah.

09:18.241 --> 09:21.448
[Jen] Right, let's work out
how to get the hell out of here.

09:21.482 --> 09:26.206
- [Rob] We're looking to get to porto alegre.
- [Woman] Here from 9 o'clock.

09:26.241 --> 09:29.413
- One hundred twenty, two person.
- Hundred and twenty?

09:29.448 --> 09:35.068
-[Rob] Second option?
-Ten o'clock, ferry boat. One hour thirty minutes.

09:35.103 --> 09:36.976
We're not going at ten, it
takes an hour and a half.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.793
We'll go at nine and
it takes thirty minutes.

09:39.586 --> 09:40.724
That's a lot of money.

09:40.758 --> 09:42.068
[Jen] Yes, so is twenty grand.

09:42.103 --> 09:45.517
Blow the budget, day
one, just on the first boat.

09:45.551 --> 09:48.482
[Jen] Robbie is definitely
the one who loves budgeting.

09:48.517 --> 09:49.724
I'm impulsive.

09:49.758 --> 09:52.758
I'm like, yeah! Sometimes I
just want things done now.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.320
[Rob] Well, I'm going
to have a look anyway.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.976
[Jen] Okay, that means
I've got to follow you.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.034
Robbie would
research for five years

09:58.068 --> 10:01.172
about what is the best
car stereo system to get.

10:01.206 --> 10:02.482
Speak to me. What's going on?

10:02.517 --> 10:04.862
Well, I don't know. I think...
Hang on, what's that here?

10:04.896 --> 10:07.862
When I get my car stereo
system, it's a great price,

10:07.896 --> 10:09.103
it's gonna last forever.

10:09.137 --> 10:12.413
You know, it's a good
quality, but at the same time,

10:12.448 --> 10:15.241
just need to be able
to listen to some music.

10:15.275 --> 10:16.755
You ain't got long
to make a decision.

10:20.068 --> 10:21.586
[Jamiul] Yes.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.793
Yes, my friend. We are ready.

10:24.827 --> 10:28.310
I think this is the better option, but
you prefer the other one, don't you?

10:28.344 --> 10:30.137
You're about money,
I'm about speed.

10:30.758 --> 10:32.206
We're always gonna clash.

10:32.241 --> 10:34.827
I just think our strategy has
been working for us so far.

10:34.862 --> 10:37.896
It's put us at an advantage.

10:37.931 --> 10:42.344
It's no point spending money if it
doesn't get you any further in the race.

10:42.379 --> 10:45.172
If this was the last week,
absolutely 100%, I'm telling you now...

10:45.206 --> 10:47.286
- We're going. Yeah, yeah.
- You're taking that boat.

10:47.310 --> 10:50.137
In the final week, you won't
do anything to stop me winning.

10:50.172 --> 10:52.320
- And I mean that.
- I'm not going to stop you from winning.

10:52.344 --> 10:53.827
We're winning
together as a team.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.413
I don't feel like you're in it
like I am. I don't feel that.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.379
I don't know why you think that.

10:58.413 --> 11:00.379
[Jamiul] Bye bye, ilha grande.

11:00.413 --> 11:02.000
Oh, bye bye.

11:04.517 --> 11:06.379
Let's do the fast boat.

11:06.413 --> 11:10.206
[Jen] I mean, we could've saved all of
this trauma and heartache if you'd just...

11:10.241 --> 11:13.965
Hi, for the 9 o'clock fast boat

11:14.000 --> 11:16.413
is there anything at all
you can do on the price?

11:16.448 --> 11:19.068
- 9 o'clock is full.
- Oh, it's full now?

11:20.310 --> 11:21.862
Okay.

11:23.965 --> 11:26.724
- Oh, what's there now?
- Back to angra dos reis.

11:28.482 --> 11:30.689
[Jen] This was just
a joke this morning.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.689
There's no point in
saving all this money

11:32.724 --> 11:34.324
if we're not gonna
spend it to get ahead.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.000
It's a fine balance,
that's what it is.

11:39.172 --> 11:40.482
[Narrator] On the mainland...

11:40.517 --> 11:42.344
Thank you.

11:42.379 --> 11:44.827
[Narrator] The boys are
on a bus to porto alegri

11:44.862 --> 11:50.275
carrying out emon's plan to head
straight out of Brazil into Argentina.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.310
Because of the early start this
morning, feeling a bit knackered.

11:56.655 --> 12:00.655
[Narrator] But jamiul still has their
financial shortcomings on his mind.

12:00.689 --> 12:02.482
I really wanted to
go through Uruguay,

12:02.517 --> 12:06.724
but I'm not too sure if
my uncle is willing to do it.

12:06.758 --> 12:09.827
But the budget is
taking a hard hit.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.631
It's hard for me to believe
that we're going to be able

12:11.655 --> 12:14.172
to make it to the
end of this race.

12:14.206 --> 12:15.586
We need to make some good money.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.931
That's what we need to focus on.

12:17.965 --> 12:21.172
You may be able to help me,
I'm trying to get to Uruguay.

12:21.482 --> 12:23.000
Okay.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.482
I'm stressing about my route, you
see. I'm trying to look for a place.

12:26.517 --> 12:28.275
If you could potentially
help me find out

12:28.310 --> 12:30.044
- where it is, that'd be great.
- Yeah, sure.

12:30.068 --> 12:31.448
[Man] Punta del este.

12:32.482 --> 12:33.689
You can take a flight.

12:33.724 --> 12:36.758
Oh, you can't take a flight.
Oh, gosh. This is hard.

12:36.793 --> 12:39.137
- Yeah.
- All right, they have a bus.

12:39.172 --> 12:41.000
- Okay.
- Twenty seven hours, man.

12:41.034 --> 12:43.068
Twenty seven hours? I
mean, we've done worse.

12:43.103 --> 12:46.448
This one leaves at 11:00pm,
gets there a day later.

12:46.482 --> 12:48.010
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.665
- My name is jamiul, by the way.
- I'm Simone.

12:49.689 --> 12:51.206
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, thank you.

12:51.241 --> 12:52.862
Best of luck, that's
really exciting.

12:52.896 --> 12:55.275
Yeah, sorry, I didn't
ask your name first.

12:55.310 --> 12:56.827
So rude of me.

12:56.862 --> 12:59.310
I'm just in race mode right now.

12:59.344 --> 13:01.448
Half an hour break, yeah?

13:03.517 --> 13:05.113
This is what I want
to put through to you.

13:05.137 --> 13:08.310
Right now, it's more
important to make money.

13:08.344 --> 13:10.965
The best place I could see
where we could find work

13:11.000 --> 13:13.310
and make some good
money as well was in Uruguay.

13:14.689 --> 13:16.137
I was looking
at this job, right?

13:16.172 --> 13:18.068
Deckhands for luxury yachts.

13:18.103 --> 13:21.379
We work on a yacht and we could
get some potentially really good money.

13:21.413 --> 13:24.103
- Where's that in?
- Punta del este.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.482
The only thing I was thinking,
that'll just slow us down.

13:26.517 --> 13:29.862
It's more important
to, uh, stay in the race

13:29.896 --> 13:33.275
to be honest and make money
rather than keep our position.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.310
If we lose a couple
of hours or summat,

13:35.344 --> 13:37.275
I think we could make
that back quite easily.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.689
It's not gonna be detrimental.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.586
Yeah, we'll do that,
we'll go to Uruguay.

13:47.620 --> 13:48.758
I think it would be better.

13:48.793 --> 13:50.389
[Narrator] Jamiul's
new moneymaking route

13:50.413 --> 13:52.034
will take them farther
down the course

13:52.068 --> 13:56.206
to cross the border into
Uruguay, then west into Argentina,

13:56.241 --> 13:59.137
through Buenos Aires
and on to the checkpoint,

13:59.172 --> 14:02.448
adding 440 kilometers
to their journey.

14:02.482 --> 14:05.586
My uncle, he's always
done what he's wanted.

14:05.620 --> 14:09.482
I'd say that in this leg, he's
heeded my words as well.

14:09.517 --> 14:12.000
I feel like an equal.

14:12.034 --> 14:14.620
We've got a good plan. I'm
glad he's stepped up a little bit,

14:14.655 --> 14:18.034
he's grown up a little bit. He's
making a lot more decisions himself.

14:27.275 --> 14:30.172
- We're only one minute ahead.
- We want to keep that one minute.

14:30.206 --> 14:32.413
- Yes.
- Come on.

14:32.448 --> 14:34.827
[Narrator] Twenty four
hours behind the race leaders,

14:34.862 --> 14:37.965
the last two teams leave
Isla grande a minute apart.

14:38.827 --> 14:41.931
- Bye-bye, lovely hotel.
- Right-o.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.482
That's the bus station?

14:43.517 --> 14:46.551
We just don't have enough
money to complete the race

14:46.586 --> 14:47.965
as it is at the moment.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.137
Working is a priority.

14:51.172 --> 14:54.000
We need to get a
least one job on this leg

14:54.034 --> 14:56.000
because we're really,
really low on budget

14:56.034 --> 14:58.241
and we know how
expensive the buses are.

14:58.275 --> 15:01.517
And basically,
what we've got left

15:01.551 --> 15:04.103
probably wouldn't
even get us to mendoza,

15:04.137 --> 15:06.655
let alone nearby.

15:06.689 --> 15:08.896
- Which way is quickest?
- Well, yeah.

15:08.931 --> 15:11.724
Once we know the
jobs we can secure,

15:11.758 --> 15:15.103
then that will help determine,
really, the route that we take.

15:15.137 --> 15:19.000
Working in rio in a hostel, we'll get
free beds, we might get some money.

15:19.034 --> 15:20.896
[Sam] Right, that's
where we're going, then.

15:20.931 --> 15:23.068
After spending
Â£600 in the last leg,

15:23.103 --> 15:24.965
Jo and Sam have just 300 left.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.068
How are we gonna go
through without money?

15:28.103 --> 15:31.068
Let's get on with it. We'll
see how far we can get.

15:31.103 --> 15:33.206
- Okay?
- Can we get a taxi to the bus station?

15:33.241 --> 15:35.241
No.

15:35.275 --> 15:37.448
[Narrator] Their first
stop is Rio de Janeiro,

15:37.482 --> 15:39.448
200 kilometers east

15:39.482 --> 15:41.827
in the opposite direction
to the checkpoint.

15:42.862 --> 15:44.275
We're off to rio.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.310
We're heading to a
hotel in copacabana.

15:47.344 --> 15:50.758
Winning the race obviously
is a massive part of it,

15:50.793 --> 15:55.655
but enjoying everything on the
way is even bigger than winning.

15:55.689 --> 15:58.206
And I'm a bit over excited.

15:58.241 --> 16:01.482
And, we've just made
our budget sandwiches.

16:01.517 --> 16:04.103
- Competitiveness will...
- Take over?

16:04.137 --> 16:06.206
Yeah, I think we'd quite
like to win, wouldn't we?

16:06.241 --> 16:07.620
Would be great to win.

16:07.655 --> 16:09.535
Mainly because you've
just written off your car.

16:10.482 --> 16:13.034
You know, having
come this far and gone,

16:13.068 --> 16:17.034
gone through all the emotional
ups and downs we've gone through,

16:17.068 --> 16:21.275
it would be really upsetting
not to get to the end.

16:21.310 --> 16:24.620
- Like a roller coaster.
- Yeah, it is like a roller coaster.

16:24.655 --> 16:27.793
[Narrator] While Jo and
Sam prioritize work...

16:27.827 --> 16:30.758
We go from Brazil
straight across Argentina.

16:30.793 --> 16:32.724
If we hit Sao Paulo,
we might be able

16:32.758 --> 16:34.517
to get straight to the
border in one bus.

16:34.551 --> 16:37.655
- Sao Paulo... ah.
- 23:40.

16:37.689 --> 16:42.034
[Narrator] ...Dom and Lizzie have a
different approach to their money worries.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.413
[Lizzie] We do need to be
fast, but we need to move cheap

16:44.448 --> 16:47.137
because we wanna save
all our money for the last leg.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.586
I'm just looking around to see if
there was people that could help us.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.620
In certain situations,

16:52.655 --> 16:56.896
I think maybe asking people
to help us purchase a ticket.

16:56.931 --> 16:59.137
- Yeah.
- We're going to have to get over it,

16:59.172 --> 17:01.586
but it feels a bit
uncomfortable asking people.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.448
"Sir, get me tickets."

17:04.482 --> 17:06.034
Now the pressure's on.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.689
And we really
have no choice left.

17:07.724 --> 17:10.448
- We actually have to do it.
- Yeah.

17:10.482 --> 17:13.586
I'd say that the two of
us have been very reliant

17:13.620 --> 17:16.034
on our parents for
a lot in our lives.

17:16.068 --> 17:19.275
Can you speak
any English at all?

17:19.310 --> 17:21.862
I'm gonna make it to the
end, competing for first place.

17:21.896 --> 17:26.448
We gonna have to start
asking people for things for free,

17:26.482 --> 17:28.068
even if it's embarrassing.

17:28.103 --> 17:29.931
Uh...

17:29.965 --> 17:33.379
There's two of
us and two tickets,

17:33.413 --> 17:37.551
but we can only... We,
we're in a race, uh...

17:39.172 --> 17:44.034
Would you be able to buy
a ticket for us to Sao Paulo?

17:45.827 --> 17:47.068
Is that okay?

17:47.103 --> 17:48.655
Obrigado.

17:50.482 --> 17:51.793
Obrigado.

17:53.103 --> 17:54.689
Ola.

17:54.724 --> 17:57.275
- So this one here.
- [Speaking foreign language]

17:57.310 --> 17:59.137
Just, uh...

17:59.172 --> 18:00.793
Dois, if you could. [Chuckles]

18:00.827 --> 18:02.551
[Speaking foreign language]

18:03.448 --> 18:05.206
If you could do
two, that would be...

18:08.862 --> 18:11.724
Si, but if you could
do two, that would be...

18:11.758 --> 18:13.275
[Speaking foreign language]

18:16.241 --> 18:17.596
Oh, no. He said
it's a lot of money.

18:17.620 --> 18:18.689
Is it too much?

18:18.724 --> 18:20.689
- If, uh...
- Have you got enough for one?

18:20.724 --> 18:22.896
He got, he got...

18:24.413 --> 18:25.655
Just uno?

18:27.724 --> 18:29.896
- It's a lot of money.
- Is it?

18:30.793 --> 18:33.172
- Okay, okay.
- No? Don't worry.

18:33.206 --> 18:34.931
We were just wondering.

18:34.965 --> 18:37.068
- It's okay. Don't worry.
- It's okay.

18:37.103 --> 18:38.463
- It's okay.
- We were just asking.

18:39.517 --> 18:41.689
How embarrassing.

18:41.724 --> 18:44.724
I don't think he was
expecting to pay for the ticket.

18:44.758 --> 18:47.034
I think he just
wanted to translate.

18:47.068 --> 18:48.344
Well, we tried.

18:49.034 --> 18:50.655
We'll get there. Right.

18:50.689 --> 18:52.620
- Okay.
- A little bit embarrassing.

18:53.655 --> 18:55.137
[Narrator] Their plan a bust,

18:55.172 --> 18:58.068
the siblings cough up
20% of the remaining budget

18:58.103 --> 19:02.172
to reach the border with
Argentina as quickly as possible.

19:02.206 --> 19:04.217
[Dom] We spent a lot of
money trying to get out of Brazil,

19:04.241 --> 19:05.551
so keep making money,

19:05.586 --> 19:07.355
keep watching our
budget, it's really important

19:07.379 --> 19:09.586
that we find some work
once we get in to Argentina.

19:10.241 --> 19:12.000
[Narrator] 800km south,

19:12.034 --> 19:14.448
Jen and Rob have
arrived in curitiba.

19:15.275 --> 19:17.068
Why can't I fit out of this bus?

19:18.724 --> 19:22.068
[Narrator] Founded in
1654, as a gold mining camp,

19:22.103 --> 19:25.000
today it's often described
as the best Brazilian city

19:25.034 --> 19:28.068
to live in with its
abundance of green spaces

19:28.103 --> 19:31.241
and innovative,
sustainable transport system.

19:31.275 --> 19:34.344
So we aim for the seven and
we've got the half seven as a backup,

19:34.379 --> 19:37.482
but we need to get to
the cambio right now.

19:37.517 --> 19:39.862
[Narrator] But husband and
wife aren't sticking around.

19:42.103 --> 19:44.206
[Jen] It's a hotel
there. They might do it.

19:45.137 --> 19:47.103
We can't miss our 7:30.

19:47.137 --> 19:50.448
[Narrator] Aiming to get a
bus south to porto alegre...

19:50.482 --> 19:54.310
Morning, do you do
money exchange, cambio?

19:54.344 --> 19:58.034
No. Ten o'clock.
Shopping centre.

19:58.068 --> 19:59.896
Ten o'clock, shopping center.

20:00.586 --> 20:02.448
[Jen] Oh, god.

20:02.482 --> 20:05.000
We don't have any riyals
to buy a bus out of here.

20:05.034 --> 20:08.172
The bus seat's in half an hour
and the cambio doesn't open till ten.

20:09.206 --> 20:10.482
It's the penultimate leg.

20:10.517 --> 20:13.655
Like, if you're going to make
headway, it needs to be now.

20:13.689 --> 20:16.689
So I just feel stupid
for letting this happen.

20:16.724 --> 20:19.965
But it's happened, so we'll
just formulate a new plan.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.689
[Narrator] With nearly ten
hours until the next bus departs

20:22.724 --> 20:24.275
for porto alegre,

20:24.310 --> 20:25.931
a change of plan.

20:25.965 --> 20:28.620
[Rob] We might as well
just look for work, I think.

20:28.655 --> 20:30.344
I'm not upset. I've
not brushed my teeth.

20:30.379 --> 20:31.413
Brilliant.

20:31.448 --> 20:33.724
Who the [bleep] is gonna
want to employ this?

20:33.758 --> 20:34.793
Look at me.

20:36.241 --> 20:37.413
Where do we even begin?

20:39.275 --> 20:41.000
- Let's have a look down in here.
- Yeah.

20:41.034 --> 20:43.206
[Jen] We'll just
head in to the town

20:43.241 --> 20:44.689
and just chat to
people and just see

20:44.724 --> 20:47.517
if anybody will pay us
to do a few hours of work.

20:47.551 --> 20:49.482
That's all we could
do, we can only ask.

20:49.517 --> 20:52.448
Ola, we're looking
to do some work

20:52.482 --> 20:53.827
for some money.

20:53.862 --> 20:56.758
We want to work and clean.

20:56.793 --> 20:58.724
- [Speaking foreign language]
- Si.

20:59.344 --> 21:00.344
Okay.

21:01.482 --> 21:03.137
I've never had
to do this before.

21:04.965 --> 21:06.620
- Over there?
- Yeah.

21:06.655 --> 21:08.620
We're looking to do some work.

21:09.275 --> 21:10.586
Okay.

21:11.551 --> 21:13.482
We're looking to
clean some dishes,

21:13.517 --> 21:16.931
to sweep, to mop some tables.

21:16.965 --> 21:17.965
[Indistinct]

21:18.896 --> 21:21.206
- Films?
- Uh-huh.

21:21.241 --> 21:22.448
[Speaking foreign language]

21:23.965 --> 21:26.586
We've been directed
towards cine-something.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.793
So I think it's the cinema.

21:28.827 --> 21:31.379
I don't really understand
why you can get a job there,

21:31.413 --> 21:34.586
but everyone seems to think
we can get jobs in cinemas.

21:35.586 --> 21:36.758
[Jen] It's not even a cinema.

21:37.758 --> 21:39.000
[Rob] Let's just give it a go.

21:41.620 --> 21:43.379
What is this place?

21:43.413 --> 21:45.275
I think it's a job center.

21:45.310 --> 21:46.586
Can't see any job adverts.

21:47.517 --> 21:49.482
What if it's a sperm
donation center?

21:50.620 --> 21:51.620
Might be.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.413
A lot of boys in here.

21:55.517 --> 21:57.517
Feels very medical. Doesn't it?

21:57.551 --> 21:59.620
I'll donate to get
the money, why not?

21:59.655 --> 22:02.344
Get a look at some
naughty books, it'd be fun.

22:05.379 --> 22:06.862
Let's go.

22:06.896 --> 22:09.620
[Narrator] After four hours
pounding the pavements...

22:09.655 --> 22:12.413
Let's have a tuna sandwich
and get back to the bus station.

22:12.448 --> 22:15.137
[Narrator] ...Jen and Rob
call quits on the job hunt.

22:15.172 --> 22:17.103
Stop dwelling, we're back on.

22:17.137 --> 22:18.655
[Narrator] As the sun goes down,

22:18.689 --> 22:21.517
arriving in Rio de
Janeiro, Jo and Sam.

22:23.379 --> 22:24.689
[Jo speaking Spanish]

22:28.172 --> 22:30.620
[Narrator] The night-time
capital of South America,

22:30.655 --> 22:32.517
home of carnival,

22:32.551 --> 22:34.344
sugarloaf mountain

22:34.379 --> 22:36.275
and iconic beaches.

22:36.310 --> 22:39.068
It's a must see destination
in South America.

22:39.103 --> 22:41.413
- Hi, I'm Jo.
- Nice to meet you.

22:41.448 --> 22:43.724
So after I check you in,

22:43.758 --> 22:45.827
we're going to go to work.

22:45.862 --> 22:47.793
We are having a
barbecue tonight.

22:47.827 --> 22:50.068
- Works for me.
- Yeah. [Chuckles]

22:50.103 --> 22:51.689
[Narrator] For mother and son,

22:51.724 --> 22:54.758
a chance to earn the money
they need to stay in the race.

22:55.689 --> 22:57.896
- You have to go deep...
- Yeah.

22:58.931 --> 23:01.379
- Thank you, my friend.
- It's okay. Thank you.

23:03.310 --> 23:04.586
It's really paid off.

23:04.620 --> 23:07.172
We took a bit of a
gamble coming to rio

23:07.206 --> 23:09.310
because it was
back on ourselves.

23:09.344 --> 23:12.241
Um, but we've
got a bed on board.

23:12.275 --> 23:13.275
We've got pay.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.379
Just check if its poisonous.

23:15.413 --> 23:18.172
And he's got food.

23:18.206 --> 23:20.448
- It's not.
- He's having a whale of a time now.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.137
Very good, my friend.

23:22.172 --> 23:23.793
The best barbecue in the world.

23:23.827 --> 23:25.103
[Both laughing]

23:25.862 --> 23:28.000
Earlier today, I was worried,

23:28.034 --> 23:30.896
you know, if we do one
or even two of the jobs,

23:30.931 --> 23:33.310
there's always a
chance that we can finish

23:33.344 --> 23:35.482
the leg, which
would be brilliant.

23:35.517 --> 23:37.000
I think that's what
we both want.

23:39.689 --> 23:42.103
There's no knots about it.

23:42.137 --> 23:43.724
We're making this work.

23:43.758 --> 23:44.931
Perfect. Perfect.

23:52.482 --> 23:54.793
[Narrator] After a
27-hour journey,

23:54.827 --> 23:56.965
emon and jamiul
arrive in Uruguay,

23:58.172 --> 24:00.827
the second smallest
country in South America,

24:00.862 --> 24:04.172
hosted the first ever
world cup in 1930,

24:05.413 --> 24:06.896
and went on to win it,

24:06.931 --> 24:10.344
beating neighbors
Argentina four-two in the final.

24:10.379 --> 24:12.172
Excuse me, wonder
if you could help me.

24:12.206 --> 24:15.689
I need to get to this place
if you know where it is.

24:15.724 --> 24:17.827
[Speaking Spanish]

24:17.862 --> 24:20.482
I can take you, if you want
to, me and my boyfriend.

24:20.517 --> 24:21.655
Are you sure?

24:21.689 --> 24:23.217
[Narrator] The boys are
turning on their charm...

24:23.241 --> 24:25.493
- Will your boyfriend be alright with the lift?
- Not at all.

24:25.517 --> 24:26.620
I appreciate it. Thanks.

24:26.655 --> 24:29.689
To track down a
lucrative job opportunity.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.689
It's a super-rich
place, isn't it?

24:32.724 --> 24:34.310
Yeah, it is.

24:34.344 --> 24:37.689
These super rich people, are
they all foreigners or Uruguayans?

24:37.724 --> 24:40.310
They are mostly argentinians.

24:41.689 --> 24:44.068
[Narrator] Down the
centerpiece of South America,

24:44.103 --> 24:47.344
punta del este is a
playground for the super-rich.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
[Indistinct]

24:51.482 --> 24:53.000
Take my picture.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.551
Come on, pal.

24:56.586 --> 24:59.172
[Narrator] With dozens of
multimillion pound yachts

24:59.206 --> 25:01.000
in its glistening harbor,

25:01.034 --> 25:04.448
it's the perfect place for
emon and jamiul to clean up.

25:04.482 --> 25:05.862
Can we ask how much it pays?

25:05.896 --> 25:09.724
Uh, pay for four
hours, $50 each.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.000
- Fifty dollars each?
- Okay.

25:11.896 --> 25:14.103
Scrub-a-dub-dub.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.275
Oh, yeah. I like a bit of crow.

25:16.310 --> 25:18.206
Make sure you do a
really good job on the crow.

25:18.241 --> 25:19.965
Make it sparkle, like blinding.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.320
And that's what
it struck the eye.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.827
These are one too many.

25:23.862 --> 25:26.344
I feel like you've definitely
gone up in the world.

25:26.379 --> 25:30.000
From cleaning Nicaraguan
buses to cleaning Uruguayan boats.

25:30.034 --> 25:31.562
I think you need to
get to the super yacht.

25:31.586 --> 25:33.551
- It's okay.
- Beautiful.

25:34.310 --> 25:35.689
Free Willy!

25:38.275 --> 25:41.482
I honestly believe
we will win it.

25:41.517 --> 25:43.482
If we didn't win, I'll
be very disappointed.

25:43.517 --> 25:45.862
- It'll be down to someone's fault.
- [Laughs]

25:45.896 --> 25:47.413
- Who's?
- Not mine.

25:47.448 --> 25:48.724
Good for the arms, this.

25:49.275 --> 25:50.965
Yeah, good workout.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.275
That's why they pay so well.

25:52.310 --> 25:55.000
Even if the money wasn't
there, I'd still want to win.

25:55.034 --> 25:57.344
When it comes to us, the
experiences stay with you.

25:57.379 --> 25:58.976
- It's true.
- For the rest of your life.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.068
What we'll get out of this
for our relationship, we'll see.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.068
I still want to win.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.000
- [Laughs]
- I still want to win.

26:05.034 --> 26:07.655
Kids these days, huh?

26:07.689 --> 26:09.724
Good job, this
one. It pays well.

26:09.758 --> 26:13.482
It gives us a fine chance
to make it to the end.

26:13.517 --> 26:15.827
- But it's not enough.
- That is the question is it enough?

26:15.862 --> 26:17.896
I don't think it's
going to be enough,

26:17.931 --> 26:20.931
so we're gonna have to
work a few more times.

26:20.965 --> 26:23.551
We need to figure out whether
or not we're staying here.

26:23.586 --> 26:26.241
Ideally, we want to be
moving to Buenos Aires.

26:26.275 --> 26:29.310
We don't want to be staying here
because the cost of staying here tonight

26:29.344 --> 26:30.793
is gonna be extortionate.

26:31.896 --> 26:35.241
- The boat is shining.
- [Laughs] Shining, like you.

26:35.275 --> 26:37.655
- Fantastic.
- Both of you did a great job.

26:38.103 --> 26:39.310
Vamos.

26:39.344 --> 26:43.000
[Narrator] As emon and jamiul
hit the road for Buenos Aires,

26:44.482 --> 26:46.379
in Rio de Janeiro...

26:47.413 --> 26:49.241
I suppose I'm broke
more than anything, yeah.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.724
After finishing another
shift at the hostel...

26:51.758 --> 26:53.241
Thank you for your help.

26:53.275 --> 26:55.275
Oh, thank you so
much. Thank you.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.310
- Obrigado.
- Obrigado.

26:58.344 --> 27:00.310
Obrigado.

27:00.344 --> 27:03.689
[Narrator] Jo and Sam can
afford to make their next move.

27:03.724 --> 27:07.241
[Jo] That's brilliant. That money's
going to make a huge difference.

27:07.275 --> 27:08.448
[Sam] That is very good.

27:08.482 --> 27:10.896
[Jo] We'll head down
to the bus station

27:10.931 --> 27:13.206
and on to Argentina.

27:13.241 --> 27:16.827
[Lizzie] Argentina this
way. I've loved Brazil.

27:16.862 --> 27:20.275
It's been cool. It's just
not been cool on our wallet.

27:20.310 --> 27:22.379
[Narrator] Already at
the argentinian border,

27:22.413 --> 27:23.758
dom and Lizzie.

27:23.793 --> 27:25.275
[Lizzie] I think this is the end

27:25.310 --> 27:27.896
of the most expensive country
we're going to pass through.

27:27.931 --> 27:29.103
- Hurray.
- Whoo!

27:29.137 --> 27:31.551
Time to go into the second
most expensive country.

27:32.724 --> 27:33.965
[Narrator] With a job lined up

27:34.000 --> 27:37.172
300km away in the
town of posadas.

27:37.206 --> 27:38.827
We could try to hitchhike still.

27:38.862 --> 27:41.310
Yeah, we could.

27:41.344 --> 27:42.965
Running out of time.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.344
[Narrator] Another
attempt to enlist local help.

27:46.103 --> 27:47.689
Make sure they can read it.

27:47.724 --> 27:50.413
- It's fine.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:50.448 --> 27:53.827
- I don't think that's necessary.
- That's brighter this way.

27:53.862 --> 27:57.344
And put a love heart.
Stand here with this.

27:57.379 --> 27:58.896
No, you gotta
hold it out properly.

27:58.931 --> 28:00.137
I just feel like a twat.

28:00.172 --> 28:03.241
- Well, we're gonna look like twats.
- It's fine.

28:03.275 --> 28:06.103
- [Sighs] - Do we find the main
road where people are going?

28:06.137 --> 28:07.758
- I think gas station's the one.
- Okay.

28:07.793 --> 28:10.068
People stop to get gas.

28:10.103 --> 28:12.620
Please por favor, senor.

28:12.655 --> 28:15.448
[Narrator] With just
12% of their budget left,

28:15.482 --> 28:17.413
brother and sister
have no choice

28:17.448 --> 28:19.413
but to overcome
their discomfort.

28:19.448 --> 28:22.620
- Everyone's gonna laugh at us.
- Yeah, I don't care.

28:22.655 --> 28:24.896
- Do you wanna go ask?
- [Sighs]

28:24.931 --> 28:27.068
Are you driving to posadas?

28:27.103 --> 28:28.827
[Speaking foreign language]

28:28.862 --> 28:31.551
Poquito. we can't
afford a boost.

28:31.586 --> 28:33.724
No? Okay. Muchos gracias.

28:33.758 --> 28:36.758
- [Speaking foreign language]
- Okay. Muchos gracias.

28:38.551 --> 28:42.517
- Actually, I'd color it in.
- Yeah.

28:42.551 --> 28:44.379
I think I'm right
about where to stand.

28:44.413 --> 28:46.172
So I think I'm better
standing by main road,

28:46.206 --> 28:47.941
where people are
actually driving to posadas,

28:47.965 --> 28:51.068
than standing at a gas station where
it's probably locals filling up their car.

28:53.034 --> 28:56.379
But you know, he
never listens to me.

28:56.413 --> 28:58.034
I am usually right.

28:58.827 --> 29:01.689
Um, the man at the station,

29:02.758 --> 29:05.379
he said it would be better

29:05.413 --> 29:09.482
if we waited at a road,

29:09.517 --> 29:11.034
which is two
kilometers that way.

29:11.068 --> 29:12.862
[Lizzie] Like I suggested
in the first place.

29:16.689 --> 29:19.448
[Narrator] 9 00km
south of dom and Lizzie...

29:19.482 --> 29:22.758
Our bus out to porto
alegre is at 8.P.M.

29:22.793 --> 29:27.103
- So we've got some time there to find some work.
- Yeah.

29:27.137 --> 29:30.172
[Narrator] After missed
boats and buses, Jen and Rob

29:30.206 --> 29:34.344
are still making their way through
Brazil to arrive in porto alegre.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.931
Situated at the
confluence of five rivers

29:39.965 --> 29:42.517
that feed into lagoa dos patos,

29:42.551 --> 29:44.103
the lagoon of the ducks.

29:44.137 --> 29:47.310
[Rob] We can try and find
work in a hostel or hotel.

29:47.344 --> 29:50.034
We want to do some
work, cleaning...

29:50.068 --> 29:51.424
- [Man speaking
foreign language] - No.

29:51.448 --> 29:52.586
- No.
- No?

29:52.620 --> 29:55.103
[Narrator] With 12 hours
till their onward journey,

29:55.137 --> 29:57.827
another attempt to
boast of their budget.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.551
Given us names of a hostel
that is three streets behind us,

30:00.586 --> 30:03.379
- we could try that.
- I hope our luck turns.

30:03.413 --> 30:05.413
Please, please, please, please.

30:05.448 --> 30:06.724
May this pull off.

30:06.758 --> 30:10.000
We're hoping that we can
help you with some work.

30:10.034 --> 30:11.517
- Of course.
- Okay.

30:11.551 --> 30:13.793
Great. What are
we gonna be doing?

30:13.827 --> 30:16.827
- Help do the clean.
- Great.

30:16.862 --> 30:19.068
- Yes, please.
- Thank you.

30:19.103 --> 30:20.517
Thank you.

30:21.551 --> 30:22.793
[Rob] Gonna happen, actually.

30:22.827 --> 30:24.587
I didn't think we're
gonna find our own work,

30:24.620 --> 30:27.689
but, here we are, working.

30:27.724 --> 30:29.344
[Vacuum whirring]

30:29.379 --> 30:31.379
Ew... oh!

30:31.413 --> 30:33.827
It's been down
there for a long time.

30:33.862 --> 30:35.379
You never know
this might help us win.

30:36.379 --> 30:37.586
Fingers crossed it will.

30:37.620 --> 30:40.448
[Jen] I have no idea how much

30:40.482 --> 30:42.448
we're getting paid for this job.

30:42.482 --> 30:44.379
It's actually cleaner
than my toilet at home.

30:44.413 --> 30:45.693
Pretty impressed with Jen today.

30:45.724 --> 30:47.655
Let's do the walls.

30:47.689 --> 30:49.655
There's honestly...
There's pubes everywhere.

30:49.689 --> 30:51.517
Got off to a really
bad start this leg

30:51.551 --> 30:52.931
with our budget being so tight.

30:52.965 --> 30:55.655
A lot of it definitely
is down to attitude.

30:55.689 --> 30:57.344
Being forced to not give up

30:57.379 --> 31:00.068
and to actually carry on
despite how you're feeling.

31:00.103 --> 31:01.206
It's a nice feeling.

31:02.137 --> 31:04.172
I'm so proud of
Rob and I as a team.

31:04.206 --> 31:05.586
We worked well together today.

31:05.620 --> 31:08.068
- [Rob] Rob and Jen.
- Hashtag winners.

31:08.103 --> 31:10.448
We wanna put this into practice

31:10.482 --> 31:11.931
in our forever lives.

31:11.965 --> 31:14.645
I think there's potentially a bit of
progress that we're making here.

31:15.517 --> 31:17.068
Oh, my god, maybe
I should be the next

31:17.103 --> 31:18.931
what's he called? Egsy.

31:18.965 --> 31:21.448
What's he actually
called? Banksy. Banksy.

31:21.482 --> 31:23.000
- Banksy.
- Banksy.

31:23.034 --> 31:24.551
- Banksy.
- Egsy. [Laughs]

31:24.586 --> 31:26.655
[Rob] I feel like
we're back in the race.

31:26.689 --> 31:29.655
It's restored our
strategy of having

31:29.689 --> 31:32.275
$400 in the last leg.

31:32.310 --> 31:34.137
Without that we would
have really struggled.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
So, yeah, we're
still in the race

31:37.034 --> 31:38.517
- and we could even win it.
- Yeah.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.758
[Dom] Por favor.

31:46.103 --> 31:48.172
My arm already hurts.

31:48.206 --> 31:50.379
[Narrator] Still
searching for a free ride,

31:50.413 --> 31:51.689
dom and Lizzie.

31:51.724 --> 31:53.241
[Lizzie] Oh, it's
going to posadas.

31:53.275 --> 31:54.758
[Dom] We could get on it.

31:54.793 --> 31:56.413
[Lizzie speaking indistinctly]

31:59.172 --> 32:01.275
Problem with hitchhiking
is you need some Patience.

32:01.310 --> 32:04.379
I think we've always done
things quite quickly with buses,

32:04.413 --> 32:07.965
so it's gonna be quite different
for us to just sit and wait.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.862
[Dom] There's someone out
there, a beautiful, kind soul.

32:12.896 --> 32:14.241
These people can read it.

32:15.689 --> 32:17.310
We found someone to help us.

32:19.448 --> 32:20.896
- [Lizzie] Dom.
- Lizzie.

32:22.275 --> 32:23.448
[Lizzie] Yes, no?

32:23.482 --> 32:24.896
[All speaking Spanish]

32:27.517 --> 32:29.413
Oh. Are you guys
going to posadas?

32:29.448 --> 32:30.517
- [Man] Yeah.
- Perfect.

32:30.551 --> 32:32.586
[Lizzie] You guys
are our lifesavers.

32:33.103 --> 32:34.172
[Dom] Oh!

32:34.206 --> 32:36.724
-Oh, that's really lovely. Thank you.
-Thanks.

32:36.758 --> 32:38.827
- Would you like one, Lizzie?
- Yeah.

32:38.862 --> 32:40.689
[Dom] So, do you know
what we haven't done?

32:40.724 --> 32:42.206
We haven't asked
what your names are.

32:42.241 --> 32:44.206
- We're so sorry.
- I'm Thomas.

32:44.241 --> 32:45.413
- Thomas.
- [Woman] Mariana.

32:45.448 --> 32:47.586
Mariana. So are
you from posadas?

32:49.862 --> 32:52.241
So are you guys
boyfriend and girlfriend?

32:52.275 --> 32:53.275
[Both] No.

32:55.172 --> 32:56.344
[Both] Ah!

32:56.379 --> 32:57.896
[Dom] We get the same thing.

32:57.931 --> 32:59.689
- [Lizzie] He's my brother.
- [Thomas] Oh.

32:59.724 --> 33:02.689
We've never actually
hitchhiked or before.

33:02.724 --> 33:04.206
Never. [Laughs]

33:04.241 --> 33:05.862
Did we look friendly?

33:05.896 --> 33:07.137
[Both laugh]

33:07.172 --> 33:08.724
Yes.

33:08.758 --> 33:10.379
[Dom] Genuinely.
Thank you so much.

33:10.413 --> 33:11.827
I think we were
gonna have to spend

33:11.862 --> 33:14.000
$30 trying to get to posadas.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.827
We can't afford to spend
that much at the moment.

33:18.448 --> 33:20.793
[Dom] This has been a
massive boost for our confidence.

33:22.310 --> 33:25.862
Not just that, meeting two
people that are genuinely lovely.

33:25.896 --> 33:29.379
And there are people out
there that are willing to help.

33:29.413 --> 33:31.137
[Thomas] We actually
have a party tonight,

33:31.172 --> 33:33.000
if you want to join us.

33:33.034 --> 33:34.620
- [Both chuckle]
- Yeah?

33:34.655 --> 33:36.482
- Yeah, sure.
- [All laughing]

33:36.517 --> 33:38.758
It's her sister's birthday.

33:38.793 --> 33:40.655
- Oh?
- We don't want to intrude.

33:40.689 --> 33:42.689
No, it should be fine.

33:42.724 --> 33:45.896
We haven't gone to a
party in two months now.

33:45.931 --> 33:48.103
- [Lizzie laughs]
- And we miss...

33:48.137 --> 33:50.551
Yeah, we really got
drunk, like, once. [Laughs]

33:53.862 --> 33:55.586
[Jamiul] All right.
What were those?

33:55.620 --> 33:57.758
This is nice.

33:57.793 --> 34:00.655
[Narrator] Emon and jamiul have
reached Uruguay's capital city,

34:00.689 --> 34:01.965
Montevideo,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.517
looking to travel
overnight to Buenos Aires.

34:04.551 --> 34:05.965
[Emon] Hola.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.862
Two tickets to
Buenos Aires at 09:30.

34:08.896 --> 34:09.931
This one.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.206
[Woman speaking Spanish]

34:13.551 --> 34:14.862
[Jamiul] All of them full?

34:14.896 --> 34:16.482
Okay.

34:16.517 --> 34:19.034
- Is there any chance?
- Today. No?

34:22.310 --> 34:23.344
Okay.

34:26.517 --> 34:28.137
[Jamiul] Okay, then go tomorrow.

34:28.172 --> 34:29.275
[Speaking Spanish]

34:34.137 --> 34:35.724
[Jamiul] We have
booked our tickets

34:36.413 --> 34:38.275
to bus and boat to

34:38.310 --> 34:41.655
Buenos Aires, unless we
get there by half-11 tomorrow.

34:41.689 --> 34:44.448
Bus and boat, everything
that we've made today on this.

34:44.482 --> 34:45.793
Everything and more.

34:45.827 --> 34:47.896
And that will mean we
stay here tonight as well.

34:48.275 --> 34:49.310
[Sighs]

34:52.758 --> 34:54.398
I don't think my head's
working right now.

34:55.655 --> 34:57.793
I think we should get in a taxi.

34:57.827 --> 34:59.413
[Emon] I don't feel
good about myself

34:59.448 --> 35:01.068
because it's the
route that I chose.

35:01.896 --> 35:04.482
I'm feeling stressed out, tired.

35:05.551 --> 35:08.000
I think a good night's rest will

35:08.034 --> 35:09.413
do us a lot of good.

35:12.517 --> 35:13.586
Hola.

35:13.620 --> 35:16.689
- Dos pesos?
- [Woman] The cost is 400 pesos.

35:17.896 --> 35:19.689
- Rent for, for both?
- Each?

35:19.724 --> 35:20.931
Oh.

35:21.551 --> 35:23.000
So much money!

35:23.034 --> 35:27.379
[Man] I feel a bit
defeated. I'm frustrated.

35:27.413 --> 35:29.551
To make it to the end is
questionable right now.

35:29.586 --> 35:32.517
To be honest with you I
don't think we'll make it.

35:32.551 --> 35:34.965
[Thunder rumbling]

35:35.000 --> 35:38.689
[Narrator] A 1000
kilometers to the north

35:38.724 --> 35:41.793
I must say that this
isn't my greatest outfit.

35:41.827 --> 35:44.620
I know. We didn't bring
any nice clothes. [Chuckles]

35:44.655 --> 35:47.862
[Narrator] Dom and Lizzie have reached
posadas with their new found friends.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.724
How do you say,
"happy birthday"?

35:49.758 --> 35:51.896
- [Speaking Spanish]
- [Both speaking Spanish]

35:51.931 --> 35:53.931
[Woman laughing]

35:53.965 --> 35:55.931
- I had no idea this was gonna happen.
- What?

35:55.965 --> 35:59.517
- We hitchhiked earlier.
- Yeah, we stood on that dusty road.

35:59.551 --> 36:02.172
- Hello!
- Nice to meet you.

36:02.206 --> 36:05.172
- Thank you for letting us come into the party.
- Oh, you're welcome.

36:05.206 --> 36:09.793
[Lively music playing]

36:13.482 --> 36:15.655
[Indistinct conversation]

36:17.448 --> 36:20.689
Despite the fact that we are in the
second to the last leg of the race,

36:20.724 --> 36:24.000
and the pressure's on, but I think this
has been the best days we've had so far.

36:24.034 --> 36:26.482
We've seen the benefit of
the kindness of strangers.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.206
It's boost our confidence a lot
to know that we can hitchhike.

36:29.241 --> 36:31.655
And the sad things is,
is that this is something

36:31.689 --> 36:33.551
we could have used
much sooner on.

36:33.586 --> 36:38.758
We could have had rich
experiences if we had done this earlier.

36:38.793 --> 36:41.620
I'm so excited to see what else
the next two weeks have to offer.

36:41.655 --> 36:43.931
[Lizzie] Oh, we've
had the best time.

36:43.965 --> 36:46.896
- Yeah, honestly. Thank you.
- This is the best time in the whole time.

36:46.931 --> 36:49.068
[Dom] We are so glad
you guys picked us up.

36:49.103 --> 36:55.103
[Laughs] I just got offered a
kiss by the, uh, the birthday girl,

36:55.137 --> 36:57.034
but I... I declined.

36:58.724 --> 37:04.689
I will not kiss her because I have to
go to bed and I have work tomorrow.

37:07.827 --> 37:11.827
[Narrator] Last team to enter
Argentina are Joe and Sam.

37:11.862 --> 37:15.655
I'm really looking forward
to going to the gaucho ranch.

37:15.689 --> 37:18.068
They climbed up
another much needed job.

37:18.103 --> 37:23.241
Being a cowboy on the
gaucho ranch and herding cattle

37:23.275 --> 37:25.689
is a bit tough.

37:25.724 --> 37:30.965
[Narrator] After crossing the border
they still have over a 1000 kms to travel

37:31.000 --> 37:33.206
to reach a ranch near cordoba

37:33.241 --> 37:37.034
9600 for two people.

37:37.068 --> 37:40.965
- Basically 265 argentinian dollars short.
- Ugh!

37:41.000 --> 37:43.379
We don't have the
money to get to the farm.

37:43.413 --> 37:46.068
So what do we do then?

37:46.103 --> 37:49.448
We could negotiate something
with the driver and see if maybe

37:49.482 --> 37:52.172
we could try and work for a
ticket or at least one of them.

37:52.206 --> 37:55.206
Good luck.

37:55.241 --> 37:57.206
[Speaking Spanish]

37:57.827 --> 38:01.275
[Speaking Spanish]

38:03.965 --> 38:06.862
[Joe speaking in English] He's
going to speak to the company to ask

38:06.896 --> 38:09.172
if we could maybe
work for the other ticket.

38:09.206 --> 38:12.655
He's just phoning his boss
to see if that's possible.

38:12.689 --> 38:17.655
If this call doesn't work out,
that's it. That's our race over

38:19.034 --> 38:22.103
[Sam] My mom is the strongest
woman I have ever met.

38:23.275 --> 38:26.551
She's told me to just
carry on with everything

38:26.586 --> 38:30.068
like she has done with
her cancer and diabetes.

38:30.103 --> 38:32.758
Nothing has ever stopped her and
nothing's ever phased her in a way

38:32.793 --> 38:36.379
to say that should
couldn't do something

38:36.413 --> 38:39.103
she just wants to live life.
You've only got one life. So live it.

38:42.103 --> 38:45.206
[Both speaking Spanish]

38:45.241 --> 38:47.448
[Speaking Spanish] [In
English] Perfect. Thank you.

38:48.137 --> 38:49.344
[Joe] They've said yes.

38:49.379 --> 38:51.586
They are going to give a ticket

38:51.620 --> 38:54.655
in exchange for work on the bus.

38:54.689 --> 38:56.275
This is a real game changer

38:56.310 --> 38:59.310
we have to serve dinner
and clean the toilets.

38:59.344 --> 39:01.965
And I don't know if anybody's
seen the toilets on these buses,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.310
but that's... I think we are
earning our money. [Chuckles]

39:05.344 --> 39:07.482
[Speaking Spanish]

39:07.517 --> 39:09.424
So relieved that this has
worked out cause we are

39:09.448 --> 39:13.241
still in the race. Thanks to this
job. So, yeah, really relieved.

39:13.275 --> 39:17.172
She has jiggled her way out of
that one which is pretty good of her.

39:17.206 --> 39:20.620
Well done for getting
the bus and the job.

39:20.655 --> 39:24.517
[Narrator] In order to pay their
way, Joe and Sam start a bus journey

39:24.551 --> 39:27.379
yet another step
further from luxury travel.

39:27.413 --> 39:29.896
[Sam] You got to do what it
takes to get to the check point.

39:35.103 --> 39:38.103
I'm feeling pretty
knackered after last night.

39:38.137 --> 39:41.689
I think I had one
too many fruit juices.

39:41.724 --> 39:44.896
[Narrator] The morning
after, the night before.

39:44.931 --> 39:47.137
[Lizzie] Nariana's little
brother wrote, "I love you.

39:47.172 --> 39:50.586
"Will you marry me? I want
see you again. My number

39:50.620 --> 39:53.241
-"is this. You are very pretty."
-[Both laugh]

39:53.275 --> 39:56.206
- And he's 12.
- You're breaking 12-year-olds hearts.

39:57.517 --> 40:00.068
- [Narrator] After three days travelling...
- Just

40:00.103 --> 40:02.793
- [speaking Spanish]
- Okay.

40:02.827 --> 40:06.172
[Narrator] The siblings reached the job
they banked on to revive their cash flow.

40:06.206 --> 40:08.000
[Lizzie] Let's work!

40:09.448 --> 40:11.793
- [Dom] Scrub, scrub, scrub.
- [Lizzy exclaims]

40:11.827 --> 40:14.482
[Lizzie] Hot work.
Really hot work.

40:15.758 --> 40:18.689
36 degrees. So hot.

40:18.724 --> 40:22.068
But never mind the head.
This is helpful to us in the race.

40:23.172 --> 40:26.034
[Exclaims]

40:26.068 --> 40:29.275
This is another job ticked
off the list of jobs I'm not sure

40:29.310 --> 40:32.172
I wanna do when I am older.

40:32.206 --> 40:36.793
You are going to be spending 12
hours a day the next 40-50 years working.

40:36.827 --> 40:39.241
- Yeah.
- You need to do something that

40:39.275 --> 40:42.655
you enjoy. Otherwise
you are going to hate life.

40:42.689 --> 40:44.137
No, you are right.

40:44.172 --> 40:47.482
[Dom] I feel guilty because
we've had an amazing upbringing,

40:47.517 --> 40:50.862
parents have supported
us financially and

40:50.896 --> 40:54.517
we haven't achieved what we
wanted to achieve and I think...

40:54.551 --> 40:58.724
"Bloody hell there's people that
like have really difficult home lives

40:58.758 --> 41:01.655
and they manage to achieve.
So I have got no excuse.

41:01.689 --> 41:05.068
I think the one thing this race
has given us, a motivation, like,

41:05.103 --> 41:08.896
no matter how tired we are...
We sleep on buses, we don't eat...

41:08.931 --> 41:12.103
Like, we have got so much determination
and motivation to finish this race.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.241
I think that's something
we can take home with us.

41:14.275 --> 41:17.965
It's given us that sense of motivation
that we hadn't had for so long.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.896
I'm quite looking forward to going
home cause I am thinking, I could...

41:20.931 --> 41:23.482
It's like a fresh start.

41:31.172 --> 41:34.206
[Both exclaiming]

41:34.241 --> 41:37.172
Would you choose to come
travelling with me again?

41:37.206 --> 41:40.103
- Yeah. I would actually.
- Yeah.

41:40.137 --> 41:42.586
I know that you
are capable. So...

41:42.620 --> 41:44.689
- [Chuckles]
- You'd pass the test.

41:44.724 --> 41:47.862
[Mockingly] Good! I'm so glad. It's
all that I have ever wanted in my life.

41:47.896 --> 41:54.000
To pass dom's test.

41:54.034 --> 41:56.655
- I'm not sure you will.
- I said a little bit.

41:56.689 --> 41:59.241
[Lizzie laughs]

41:59.275 --> 42:01.379
[Speaking Spanish]

42:01.413 --> 42:04.517
[In English] Oh! I'm so excited.
Check point here I come.

42:04.551 --> 42:07.689
[Narrator] As dom and Lizzie
begin their epic journey to mendoza,

42:07.724 --> 42:11.206
1700 kms away...

42:11.241 --> 42:14.379
Bye-bye, Uruguay. [Indistinct]

42:14.413 --> 42:18.620
[Narrator] 540 kms closer
to the check point than them

42:18.655 --> 42:21.931
emon and jamiul are
crossing the rio De la plata.

42:21.965 --> 42:26.758
Scene of a famous world war ii
naval battle to reach Buenos Aires.

42:26.793 --> 42:29.000
I'm glad to be leaving, you
know, I'm not going to lie.

42:29.034 --> 42:31.103
Brazil and Uruguay has
been expensive for us.

42:31.137 --> 42:33.758
[Narrator] With just
5% of their budget left

42:33.793 --> 42:35.137
to get to the finish line,

42:35.172 --> 42:37.137
they face a tough decision.

42:37.172 --> 42:39.931
We just haven't got
anyway close to enough

42:39.965 --> 42:44.241
maybe staying in Buenos Aires, another
job might be the thing we have to do.

42:44.275 --> 42:48.103
We are really risking a lot.
The other teams are close by.

42:48.137 --> 42:50.310
- We got to make some calls.
- Yeah.

42:50.344 --> 42:52.596
But if we can work as much as we
can on this leg and as much money

42:52.620 --> 42:54.965
as we can we get up to $300

42:55.000 --> 42:57.689
and then on the next leg
just race as hard as possible.

42:57.724 --> 43:00.413
Tough times ahead.

43:00.448 --> 43:02.344
[Speaking Spanish]

43:02.379 --> 43:04.965
[Narrator] Also newly
arrived at Buenos Aires...

43:05.000 --> 43:06.689

- Rob and Jen

43:07.379 --> 43:10.931
[speaking Spanish]

43:10.965 --> 43:13.310
Okay. Got this.

43:13.344 --> 43:15.551
Let me keep hold of this.
You've asked a clown.

43:16.965 --> 43:19.931
It's a 8:45 bus to mendoza.

43:19.965 --> 43:23.103
Which gets us in about
mid-day tomorrow.

43:23.137 --> 43:27.068
[Narrator] Named for the fair
wind that helped establish the city

43:27.103 --> 43:30.655
as one of the continent's
premier ports, Buenos Aires

43:30.689 --> 43:33.931
is also known as the
Paris of South America.

43:33.965 --> 43:37.448
Thanks to the influence of
the French urban planning

43:37.482 --> 43:41.068
and its boulevards,
palaces and cafe culture.

43:41.103 --> 43:45.551
It's most famous
export, the tango.

43:52.586 --> 43:54.206
[Jen] They look really in love.

43:56.379 --> 43:59.172
[Rob] Do you how to
tango? It would be nice to try.

43:59.206 --> 44:02.275
[Jen] I think we might enjoy it.

44:02.310 --> 44:04.206
Hi! [Laughs]

44:04.241 --> 44:08.931
[Narrator] Originating in the backstreets
of Buenos Aires in the late 19th century...

44:08.965 --> 44:12.000
- Could you show us a move?
- [Speaks Spanish]

44:12.482 --> 44:14.241
Okay.

44:14.275 --> 44:17.424
[Narrator] This passionate dance was inspired
by the cultures of the city's African

44:17.448 --> 44:20.206
and European
immigrant communities.

44:20.241 --> 44:22.517
- Three, four...
- Four.

44:22.551 --> 44:24.448
Oh, yeah.

44:24.482 --> 44:27.000
We met on the dance floor.

44:27.034 --> 44:29.586
- On a night out in Lincoln.
- How awful.

44:29.896 --> 44:33.103
[Laughs]

44:33.137 --> 44:36.413
- I was a good dancer, wasn't I?
- Hmm... [laughs nervously]

44:36.448 --> 44:38.275
He grew on me, yeah.

44:38.310 --> 44:40.275
You were interesting.
You had a nice chat.

44:41.862 --> 44:45.310
Oh, gosh, okay. I'm
on the wrong foot.

44:45.344 --> 44:48.482
You were just so different
from anyone else I've ever met.

44:48.517 --> 44:51.620
- He means fat.
- [Laughs] I don't mean anything.

44:52.827 --> 44:56.034
We agree on most things,

44:56.068 --> 44:59.724
- i think that's why we gel so well.
- Mmm, you're right, actually.

44:59.758 --> 45:02.137
It's when we disagree we
come into massive problems.

45:02.172 --> 45:05.275
Which is generally around
direction and transport and travel.

45:05.310 --> 45:06.310
Great.

45:07.137 --> 45:08.931
Three... four...

45:08.965 --> 45:10.551
That was good.

45:10.586 --> 45:12.344
Six... seven...

45:12.379 --> 45:13.896
Yeah!

45:15.551 --> 45:17.068
Oh!

45:17.103 --> 45:20.103
We shake hands,
apparently. This is nice.

45:20.137 --> 45:22.965
-How so kind of you. Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.758
I just don't know why we can't
get further up the leaderboard.

45:27.793 --> 45:29.896
It frustrates me.

45:29.931 --> 45:34.172
[Rob] We can so do it. We're in
touching distance of winning this.

45:34.206 --> 45:36.172
[Jen] We do have a
chance. You know, we're here

45:36.206 --> 45:38.286
it's the penultimate leg
and we're still in the race.

45:38.310 --> 45:39.724
It'll be such an achievement.

45:39.758 --> 45:43.448
It'll affirm that we're a great
team and a great couple, won't it?

45:43.482 --> 45:45.034
That we're strong together.

45:46.482 --> 45:48.448
We can achieve really
good things together.

45:48.482 --> 45:50.655
Yeah, that's it, that
things can be overcome.

45:50.689 --> 45:53.724
Just to win it would just, yeah,
really be the icing on the cake.

45:53.758 --> 45:55.896
Well, a divorce isn't on
the cards anymore, isn't it?

45:56.793 --> 45:59.586
- Yeah?
- [Laughs]

45:59.620 --> 46:02.172
[Narrator] While Jen and
Rob head out of Buenos Aires...

46:02.206 --> 46:05.034
- [Jen] Bus goes in an hour.
- [Rob] And then we can race, race, race.

46:05.068 --> 46:08.379
[Narrator] Staying to work
once more, uncle and nephew.

46:08.413 --> 46:10.551
[Emon] I've cut a
few heads in my life.

46:10.586 --> 46:12.493
I don't know if they're gonna
let me have a customer or not.

46:12.517 --> 46:16.103
[Narrator] ...Hoping that emon's
hairdressing skills may pay dividends.

46:16.137 --> 46:17.862
This is supposed
to be the place.

46:17.896 --> 46:19.527
- Do you know who that is?
- No, who is it?

46:19.551 --> 46:21.379
- Diego maradona.
- That's maradona?

46:21.413 --> 46:23.517
The legend himself.

46:23.551 --> 46:24.896
- Julio?
- Ola.

46:24.931 --> 46:26.586
- Ola.eamon.
- Eamon?

46:26.620 --> 46:28.482
[Both speaking Spanish]

46:32.103 --> 46:35.448
[Narrator] Julio, barber
to the footballing stars,

46:35.482 --> 46:37.000
is also known as "El craaa."

46:39.655 --> 46:42.827
[Emon] If we were to cut hair,
do we get money for haircuts?

46:42.862 --> 46:44.620
[Speaking Spanish]

46:46.655 --> 46:47.965
[Emon] Yeah, no problem.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.241
[Julio speaking Spanish]

46:51.896 --> 46:53.137
Okay, we'll wash, no problem.

46:55.034 --> 46:56.034
Diego maradona?

46:57.724 --> 46:59.034
His friend, eh?

47:00.620 --> 47:02.172
What do you think
of the "hand of god"?

47:02.206 --> 47:05.172
- Remember, england?
- No, we don't remember that.

47:05.206 --> 47:07.000
- You don't remember that?
- We didn't see.

47:07.034 --> 47:08.862
You didn't see
it? Oh! I seen it.

47:08.896 --> 47:11.000
- Ah-ha-ha-ha!
- [All laugh]

47:15.103 --> 47:16.482
[Speaking Spanish]

47:18.896 --> 47:23.034
So, we've got a commission, so the
onus is on us to earn some money.

47:23.068 --> 47:24.482
Get some punches in.

47:24.517 --> 47:25.655
Ola.

47:26.586 --> 47:28.482
[Speaking in Spanish]

47:28.931 --> 47:30.103
No?

47:31.551 --> 47:33.206
[Speaking in Spanish]

47:33.241 --> 47:34.896
All right. Come back.

47:34.931 --> 47:36.482
[Speaking in Spanish]

47:39.206 --> 47:41.103
Come inside. Oh, your dog?

47:41.137 --> 47:43.413
Yeah. I'll do your dog as well.

47:44.310 --> 47:47.000
[Speaking in Spanish]

47:49.689 --> 47:51.655
It's a hard task, this one.

47:53.931 --> 47:55.655
[Speaking in Spanish]

47:55.689 --> 47:57.034
means "do you want a haircut?"

47:57.068 --> 48:00.034
And I've been standing out
here for the last 20 minutes or so

48:00.068 --> 48:02.310
saying I want a
haircut to everybody.

48:02.344 --> 48:04.241
[Speaking in Spanish]

48:09.448 --> 48:11.827
Ooh, he has a
big muff under that.

48:13.068 --> 48:14.448
[Speaking in Spanish]

48:16.310 --> 48:18.241
He popped his
arm like it was a lid.

48:18.793 --> 48:20.379
Just...

48:21.896 --> 48:25.137
Head back. Let me just get
the temperature right for you.

48:25.172 --> 48:28.068
- Come to any football matches, games?
- No.

48:28.103 --> 48:31.241
- Good. Good.
- Yeah? Okay, I'm happy.

48:32.793 --> 48:34.344
Is that for me?
Thank you very much.

48:36.482 --> 48:38.620
Thank you. Gracias.

48:38.655 --> 48:40.965
- [Speaking Spanish]
- Okay, brilliant.

48:42.586 --> 48:45.000
For washing the hair. Thank you.

48:50.482 --> 48:56.724
When I signed up for the race, I didn't
ever think I'd be cleaning toilets in a bus.

48:56.758 --> 48:58.827
All part of the
experience. It means

48:58.862 --> 49:02.551
we definitely get to the
checkpoint, so it's all good.

49:04.034 --> 49:07.689
[Narrator] Jo and Sam are 14
hours into their 25-hour bus ride

49:07.724 --> 49:09.379
to the ranch in cordoba.

49:09.413 --> 49:13.103
This is the weirdest job
I've ever had in my life.

49:13.137 --> 49:15.172
Working hard for
their free ticket.

49:16.206 --> 49:18.172
I wonder what the
other teams are doing.

49:18.206 --> 49:22.586
Grooming Polo horses
or on super yachts.

49:24.103 --> 49:28.896
I'm so excited that we're
going to a gaucho ranch.

49:28.931 --> 49:32.241
That was one of my
big wishes about this trip

49:32.275 --> 49:34.344
when I realised
where we were coming.

49:34.379 --> 49:36.206
[Jo speaking Spanish]

49:38.103 --> 49:43.413
Sam's really had his moments. He doesn't
like budgeting or losing out on food.

49:43.448 --> 49:47.103
But I'm really proud of him.
He's, sort of, struggled through.

49:47.137 --> 49:48.862
Do you want some meat?

49:48.896 --> 49:50.724
No, thanks, I'm vegetarian.

49:50.758 --> 49:52.793
- Oh.
- But you can have it, if you want to.

49:52.827 --> 49:55.034
Oh, thank you very
much, thank you.

49:55.068 --> 49:58.413
And I know some of
that he's done for me

49:58.448 --> 50:00.655
because he understands how much

50:00.689 --> 50:03.896
I want to continue
the race and finish it.

50:03.931 --> 50:06.620
And what's lovely now
is he really wants to.

50:06.655 --> 50:09.379
[All speaking Spanish]

50:09.413 --> 50:11.827
- Tour number?
- Ten.

50:11.862 --> 50:14.965
[Sam] I'm on this. It's a
no-brainer, to be honest.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.586
Going to the ranch which
mum has always wanted to do.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.310
[Narrator] The sweeping plains
of the argentinian pampas...

50:27.344 --> 50:28.827
Gaucho country.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
Inhabited for centuries
by nomadic horsemen,

50:33.034 --> 50:36.137
tending to cattle
and living off the land.

50:36.172 --> 50:39.413
[Jo] Yeah, this is what I
pictured. The horse in the corrall.

50:39.448 --> 50:44.862
- [Jo speaking Spanish]
- [Man speaking Spanish]

50:49.034 --> 50:52.137
You are quite stupid
sheep. I'm just feeding you.

50:52.172 --> 50:53.931
They're massive sheep.

50:53.965 --> 50:57.344
[Narrator] Getting to work for
a genuine gaucho, Fernando,

50:57.379 --> 50:59.068
Jo and Sam muck in.

51:00.068 --> 51:02.517
Oh, my god. Look at 'em toads!

51:06.862 --> 51:09.586
- Is this what you're hoping for, mum?
- Yeah, brilliant.

51:09.620 --> 51:11.206
He's like the horse whisperer.

51:14.931 --> 51:19.241
My father has an uncle
who has a ranch in Argentina

51:19.275 --> 51:21.827
and when I found that out,

51:21.862 --> 51:25.689
I just wanted to come
here and work on a ranch.

51:25.724 --> 51:29.793
So to have that dream
come true is brilliant.

51:29.827 --> 51:32.379
[Sam] All the noises that's
making. You like horses.

51:32.413 --> 51:34.103
[Jo] It's a horse
noise. [Laughs]

51:34.137 --> 51:35.172
[Sam] Sounds like a pig.

51:37.586 --> 51:40.448
I'm not havin' that.
Sorry, I'm not havin' that.

51:41.241 --> 51:42.586
Is it trying to bite you?

51:42.620 --> 51:44.620
It's just playing like a dog.

51:44.655 --> 51:46.586
- Just playing.
- Just like olly, our dog.

51:46.620 --> 51:47.896
Yeah. [Laughs]

51:47.931 --> 51:50.212
[Sam] It's coming back for
more, it's coming back for more.

51:51.344 --> 51:54.586
- I'm okay.
- Hello, baby.

51:54.620 --> 51:58.931
Fantastic, this just what
dreams are made of,

51:58.965 --> 52:01.689
brushing the horse in
Argentina and sunshine.

52:02.758 --> 52:05.137
Hey, beautiful.
That is a good girlie.

52:05.172 --> 52:09.620
-I'm currently [bleep] my pants.
-[Laughs]

52:10.482 --> 52:12.241
[Sam] That thing
moves, I'm gone.

52:12.275 --> 52:16.034
[Narrator] While
mother and son sit tight,

52:16.068 --> 52:18.827
dom and Lizzie their last
connection to mendoza.

52:19.413 --> 52:20.482
[Dom] We got it.

52:23.275 --> 52:24.689
- No way.
- [Laughs]

52:24.724 --> 52:26.907
[Lizzie] It's the first time I
asked a stranger for something?

52:26.931 --> 52:28.655
[Dom] Go, go, go!

52:28.689 --> 52:32.310
[Narrator] Already arriving into
the city, the other two teams...

52:33.379 --> 52:34.931
[Rob] Gotta a
chance of coming first.

52:34.965 --> 52:36.137
[Jen] Why you think that?

52:36.172 --> 52:38.103
I just got a feeling.

52:38.137 --> 52:40.737
I think you probably just caught
wind, but let's hope you're right.

52:42.206 --> 52:44.344
[Emon] I still stand
by our decision.

52:44.379 --> 52:47.310
If we didn't focus on budget, we
wouldn't be making it to ushuaia.

52:47.344 --> 52:49.000
At least we're in
a better position.

52:49.034 --> 52:50.034
Yeah, we are.

52:50.068 --> 52:51.068
To make it to the end.

52:51.103 --> 52:53.068
So we're sort of vying
in to make it to the end.

52:53.103 --> 52:54.827
[Bell dinging]

52:57.896 --> 52:59.206
Pretty hot, isn't it?

53:00.482 --> 53:01.655
[Device beeps]

53:01.689 --> 53:03.517
Take a trunk to belgrano.

53:03.551 --> 53:05.551
- Belgrano.
- Belgrano.

53:06.655 --> 53:08.344
We're here. Belgrano's
the other end.

53:08.379 --> 53:09.827
No way!

53:09.862 --> 53:11.379
Belgrano, belgrano, belgrano.

53:12.068 --> 53:13.068
Let's go.

53:23.103 --> 53:24.623
Oh, yeah, belgrano.
Yeah, seein' again.

53:25.655 --> 53:26.689
You know what it means?

53:26.724 --> 53:27.862
We'll Google it.

53:28.793 --> 53:30.689
Google it?

53:30.724 --> 53:34.448
That was a warship, wasn't
it? That I think we sank.

53:34.482 --> 53:36.482
[Jen] Oh, well, we're
gonna be really welcome.

53:36.517 --> 53:37.586
[Rob laughs]

53:39.000 --> 53:40.965

- [Emon] Here we are, belgrano.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.172
- [Device beeps] - Proceed
on foot to the fountain

53:43.206 --> 53:47.275

the Plaza independencia.

53:47.310 --> 53:50.551
[Speaking foreign language]
Plaza independencia?

53:50.586 --> 53:54.137
Indenpendencia? Plaza independencia?
[Speaking foreign language]

53:55.620 --> 53:56.862
[Jamiul] I think this is it.

53:56.896 --> 53:58.827
[Narrator] Plaza independencia.

54:00.172 --> 54:02.620
The vibrant central
hub of mendoza.

54:03.482 --> 54:06.310

54:06.344 --> 54:10.000

the seventh checkpoint.

54:10.034 --> 54:12.655
- Southside?

See a fountain?

54:14.379 --> 54:17.000

- I can see one over there, yeah.

54:17.034 --> 54:19.034

54:19.068 --> 54:21.379

54:21.413 --> 54:27.482
Proceed through the park till you
reach checkpoints park Hyatt mendoza.

54:27.517 --> 54:29.448
[Jamiul] Park Hyatt mendoza.

54:30.620 --> 54:32.689
Park Hyatt, is that
over there. Do we know?

54:32.724 --> 54:34.000
Should we ask first?

54:34.620 --> 54:36.068
Park Hyatt mendoza?

54:37.275 --> 54:38.482
[Jamiul] Gracias.

54:38.517 --> 54:40.965
Hello, dog, excuse
me. I'm in a race.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.586
Whoa! That's what you call a
barbecue? Look at that, huh?

54:44.620 --> 54:48.034
- [Rob] Can you get up these stairs?
- [Jen] No.

54:49.310 --> 54:52.517
Oh, yes. Let's sprint
faster, come on.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.310
Get your foot in that door.

54:57.344 --> 55:00.000
[Jamiul] Open for me. Oh, okay.

55:02.793 --> 55:06.517
- Hola!
- Hola, hola! Thank you.

55:07.379 --> 55:09.448
- [Sighs]

55:10.862 --> 55:12.000

55:13.344 --> 55:16.689
[Both cheering]

55:17.344 --> 55:20.655
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

55:20.689 --> 55:22.827
- Oh, my god!
- [Sighs wearily]

55:23.586 --> 55:26.241
We're first.

55:26.275 --> 55:28.379
I can't even write!

55:28.413 --> 55:30.068
[Jen] Oh, my god!

55:31.103 --> 55:33.000
47.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.862
Yay!

55:35.896 --> 55:37.827
I don't believe it.

55:37.862 --> 55:40.655
We put so much effort in,
it seems to have paid off.

55:41.793 --> 55:44.862
[Both cheering]

55:44.896 --> 55:48.241
I think it's because like we
just got dead brave. Haven't we?

55:48.275 --> 55:49.700
- Yeah, we're not scared to ask.
- No.

55:49.724 --> 55:53.413
- Were quick at asking the right questions.
- We would've been scared.

55:53.448 --> 55:55.344
[Jen] Oh, my god.

55:55.379 --> 55:58.758
Don't mind if I do. This leg,
despite how hard it's been,

55:58.793 --> 56:00.206
has been a new us.

56:00.241 --> 56:02.034
Negotiating, bartering,

56:02.068 --> 56:04.448
- not taking no for an answer.
- Having a happier face on.

56:04.482 --> 56:06.827
Having a happier face.

56:06.862 --> 56:09.413
[Both] Cheers, winner!

56:09.448 --> 56:10.848
[Rob] We need to
go for the win now.

56:15.551 --> 56:17.000
- Okay.
- Isn't it close?

56:17.034 --> 56:18.907
[Emon] It's nice to see jenn
and Rob first because they

56:18.931 --> 56:20.113
haven't come in first place yet.

56:20.137 --> 56:22.517
I actually thought you
might not make it this point

56:22.551 --> 56:26.206
with the money we
had, but, you know...

56:26.241 --> 56:30.448
- Good leg overall, I think.
- Upped our budget, it's a good experience.

56:30.482 --> 56:32.251
- [Jamiul] Pressures on them.
- Pressure is on them.

56:32.275 --> 56:35.000
- Pressure's always on top spot.
- [Emon] Yeah.

56:35.034 --> 56:36.655
I'm hoping that we can catch up.

56:36.689 --> 56:39.344
I think we can. I
think we do this.

56:39.379 --> 56:40.965
[Emon] Oh, sorry.
My leg's gonna smell.

56:44.655 --> 56:45.793
Southside.

56:45.827 --> 56:47.206
- [Lizzie] Yeah.
- Southside.

56:47.931 --> 56:50.034
Go!

56:50.068 --> 56:51.379
[Dom] Come on.

56:51.413 --> 56:52.482
[Both] Hello!

56:52.517 --> 56:53.655
[Speaking foreign language]

56:54.551 --> 56:57.379
- Third.
- Okay.

56:57.413 --> 56:59.034
[Dom] We caught up.

56:59.068 --> 57:02.620
In Argentina, we
were 31 hours behind.

57:02.655 --> 57:06.379
Then we got to Isla grande
and we were 24 hours behind.

57:06.413 --> 57:08.862
And now we've got here,
we're 9 hours behind.

57:08.896 --> 57:10.389
So we're clearly
doing something right?

57:10.413 --> 57:12.448
- [Both] Oh!
- [Lizzie] If we carry on like this,

57:12.482 --> 57:14.976
I don't think the others will
expect us to be moving this quickly.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.827
And we won't let
them know our plan.

57:17.862 --> 57:20.586
- I've just had a thought.
- Oh. [Laughs]

57:20.620 --> 57:22.551
Where's Jo and Sam?

57:24.965 --> 57:26.724
[Sam] Cow does not sound happy.

57:26.758 --> 57:30.103
- [Speaking foreign language]
- Welcome.

57:30.137 --> 57:32.620
- [Jo] We just got here.
- [Woman] Why you in the race?

57:32.655 --> 57:35.000
Uh, well, no one wanted
to go with my mom.

57:35.034 --> 57:37.034
[All laugh]

57:37.068 --> 57:40.172
No, uh, there's an
opportunity like this,

57:40.206 --> 57:44.310
you have to do it, and
with my mom is really nice.

57:44.344 --> 57:48.034
[Sam] Being in this ranch
with this family is incredible.

57:48.068 --> 57:49.379
I'll look back at this

57:49.413 --> 57:52.862
and think, wow, I'll forget
about all the hard times and the

57:52.896 --> 57:55.758
bad times I've been through
and just look at the good times.

57:55.793 --> 58:00.551

58:00.586 --> 58:05.034
He says, you'll realize in
10 years how brilliant I am.

58:05.068 --> 58:06.896
[All chuckling]

58:06.931 --> 58:09.241
[Sam] The budget is very tight.

58:09.275 --> 58:12.344
I don't even know whether
we'll be able to finish.

58:15.586 --> 58:17.482
We're finally here. Boom!

58:17.517 --> 58:18.896
I'm coming to get you.

58:18.931 --> 58:21.241

states of emergency,

58:25.758 --> 58:27.551
21,000 kilometers.

58:27.586 --> 58:29.448
- I think we're here.
- The finish line.

58:29.482 --> 58:30.896
See. I wanna win.

58:30.931 --> 58:33.724
Twenty thousand pounds awaits.

58:33.758 --> 58:35.068
- Whoa!
- There's the book.

58:35.103 --> 58:36.551
It's been so wonderful!
