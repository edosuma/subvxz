00:04.730 --> 00:07.339
(door buzzes)

00:11.828 --> 00:14.596
- Hey. It's time.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.560
Samir, come on.

00:21.930 --> 00:25.190
(soft piano music)

00:33.776 --> 00:36.702
(handcuff clicking)

00:52.869 --> 00:55.429
(sighs)

01:03.046 --> 01:05.822
(phone buzzing)

01:05.824 --> 01:08.150
(sighs)

01:08.961 --> 01:10.294
- Hello, Mumma.

01:10.296 --> 01:11.904
- What time will you be home?

01:11.980 --> 01:13.405
I'm making lazakiyat
for dessert.

01:13.557 --> 01:15.299
- You don't have
to do that, Mumma.

01:15.317 --> 01:17.467
- Just tell me when
to expect you.

01:17.486 --> 01:19.745
- Two hours, hopefully less.
I have one more airport drop.

01:19.822 --> 01:23.307
<i> - As long as you're home on</i>
<i> time to eat a proper dinner</i>

01:23.309 --> 01:24.750
<i> and have a good night's sleep.</i>
- I know, Mumma.

01:24.977 --> 01:27.811
- You don't need me to tell you
how important tomorrow is.

01:27.830 --> 01:29.129
- No, I don't.

01:30.149 --> 01:32.073
My clients here. I have to go.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.134
<i> - Okay, okay. Hurry home.</i>

01:36.913 --> 01:39.673
- You know, we've been over
this, Teri.

01:39.749 --> 01:43.084
That's as high as he'll go.
Yeah, he's fully funded.

01:43.086 --> 01:46.688
He's ready to sign, so if this
isn't gonna work, tell me now.

01:47.850 --> 01:49.182
Thank you.

01:49.335 --> 01:52.018
Uh no, I was talking
to my driver.

01:52.171 --> 01:54.929
Uh, just to Boston for
a conference.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.007
(door closes)

01:57.009 --> 01:58.992
Well, he's sick of waiting.

02:00.362 --> 02:02.512
So let me know within
the hour, yes or no.

02:02.531 --> 02:05.374
The moment I take off,
the offer's dead.

02:07.186 --> 02:09.186
Um, I'm cutting my flight
a little close,

02:09.188 --> 02:11.296
you mind if we get going?
- Right.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.465
(engine starts)

02:17.471 --> 02:19.972
Excuse me,
have I driven you before?

02:20.123 --> 02:21.198
- Sorry?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.124
- You look familiar.

02:23.144 --> 02:26.562
- It's the first time
I've used this company.

02:41.236 --> 02:43.162
- I knew you looked familiar.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.457
(chuckles)

02:48.227 --> 02:49.484
I knew I recognized you.

02:49.561 --> 02:50.836
- Mystery solved.

02:51.063 --> 02:52.588
- You're famous.

02:53.323 --> 02:54.748
- I wouldn't say that.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.583
- Your face is everywhere.

02:56.660 --> 02:59.569
- Well, it's usually covered
in gum or graffiti

02:59.663 --> 03:02.598
so I'm surprised you even
recognized me.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.925
(Alice chuckles)

03:05.077 --> 03:06.092
- I'm Samir, by the way.

03:06.169 --> 03:09.188
- I'm Alice.
But you already knew that.

03:09.264 --> 03:10.747
It's nice to meet you, Samir.

03:10.766 --> 03:13.525
(phone rings)
- Oh, excuse me.

03:14.586 --> 03:17.845
That was fast, Teri.
Do we have a deal or not?

03:17.923 --> 03:20.741
Glad you finally came
to your senses.

03:20.776 --> 03:23.944
(plane rumbling)

03:24.688 --> 03:27.664
(indistinct PA announcement)

03:32.621 --> 03:35.956
Oh, thank you for getting
me here so fast.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.198
- That's not necessary.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.866
- Rebooking my flight would've
cost a lot more.

03:38.944 --> 03:41.011
Please. I insist.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.726
(phone buzzes)

03:52.791 --> 03:53.899
- Hey, Mr. B.

03:53.976 --> 03:54.808
- You still at the airport?

03:55.127 --> 03:56.643
- Yeah.
<i> - Good, I've got a pick-up</i>

03:56.795 --> 03:59.646
for you, terminal C.
I'll text you the client's info.

03:59.798 --> 04:02.983
- I'm off the clock, remember?
I'm taking the MCAT tomorrow.

04:03.135 --> 04:06.470
- You must be confusing me
for someone who gives a crap.

04:06.989 --> 04:09.564
- Please, I told you last week.
<i> - Look, you're already there.</i>

04:09.583 --> 04:12.751
Terminal C or you can hand
in your keys.

04:17.165 --> 04:19.633
(she giggles)

04:20.928 --> 04:22.577
- Ryan.
- What?

04:22.654 --> 04:24.746
- Just wait until
we get to the hotel.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.473
(Ryan sighs)

04:32.831 --> 04:34.273
(car honking)

04:34.424 --> 04:35.923
(gasping)

04:35.925 --> 04:37.167
- Sorry.
- Oh! Oh my god!

04:37.169 --> 04:38.110
- What the hell?

04:38.337 --> 04:41.171
- I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

04:41.264 --> 04:43.356
- Oh my god!
- Here. Some wipes.

04:43.509 --> 04:44.674
- Keep your eyes on the road!

04:45.344 --> 04:48.194
- This is a Tissa Fontaneda.
It's totally ruined.

04:48.347 --> 04:50.330
- We'll get it reimbursed, babe.

04:51.867 --> 04:52.958
- Unbelievable.

04:53.035 --> 04:54.334
(irritated sigh)

04:58.373 --> 04:59.631
- I got it out.

05:02.210 --> 05:03.242
- What about this stain here?

05:03.320 --> 05:04.303
- That's not coffee,

05:04.379 --> 05:06.379
it's just water.
I wiped it.

05:06.456 --> 05:08.031
- It needs professional
cleaning.

05:08.033 --> 05:08.974
- Seriously?

05:09.551 --> 05:11.476
- That and the client's
dry-cleaning

05:11.628 --> 05:13.461
are comin' out
of your pay cheque.

05:13.555 --> 05:15.022
(fake cough): Wanker.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.298
- Did you say something?

05:17.376 --> 05:18.317
- Me?

05:18.894 --> 05:22.154
No, no. I just got some, um...
some dust caught in my throat.

05:26.309 --> 05:27.975
Did this to me last week,

05:28.570 --> 05:31.071
docked me for wearing
my Liverpool tie.

05:31.223 --> 05:32.831
At least I wore a damn tie.

05:34.335 --> 05:37.151
Cheer up, mate. You coming over
tomorrow for the semifinals?

05:37.229 --> 05:38.562
- I can't.

05:38.564 --> 05:40.730
- Shawna's got a cousin
in town, she's proper fit.

05:40.824 --> 05:43.008
She's gonna be there.
- I have the MCAT.

05:43.159 --> 05:46.970
- Again? That's what,
three times?

05:47.997 --> 05:49.723
- This is number four.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.926
- Well, best of luck then.

05:53.002 --> 05:55.562
(water spraying)

06:03.697 --> 06:06.406
(phone rings)

06:18.045 --> 06:19.119
- Hello?

06:19.195 --> 06:21.605
- Oh, my God, Samir?
Hi. You found it!

06:21.607 --> 06:22.214
- Hi.

06:22.365 --> 06:23.440
- This is Alice Baylor.

06:23.458 --> 06:24.883
You dropped me off a couple
hours ago.

06:25.034 --> 06:26.459
- I know.

06:26.612 --> 06:28.220
<i> - Oh my god, I was completely</i>
<i> losing my mind.</i>

06:28.296 --> 06:30.296
I thought I'd left it
at security

06:30.449 --> 06:33.040
<i> and then my flight was delayed</i>
<i> and I just...</i>

06:33.060 --> 06:34.709
oh my god,
I can finally breathe.

06:34.786 --> 06:38.788
- It's no problem. I can put it
in the mail for you.

06:38.807 --> 06:42.216
- Oh uh, no, I'm back Thursday,
so it... it won't get there.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.568
Do you mind holding on to it?

06:43.645 --> 06:46.296
<i> I can have someone from</i>
<i> my office come get it.</i>

06:46.298 --> 06:47.722
- Or I can pick you up
at the airport

06:47.799 --> 06:50.300
and give it to you then.
- Oh. Uh. You're not booked up?

06:50.302 --> 06:51.726
- When do you land?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.227
- Um... 12:15.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.913
- That's fine. Same airline?

06:55.064 --> 06:56.248
- Yeah.
(PA announcement)

06:56.399 --> 06:58.158
Oh shoot, we're boarding.
Finally.

06:58.234 --> 06:59.418
Um, thank you so much, Samir.

06:59.645 --> 07:01.144
<i> You're a lifesaver.</i>
<i> I'll see you on Thursday.</i>

07:01.163 --> 07:03.146
- See you then.
I'll keep it charged!

07:03.165 --> 07:04.965
<i> - Okay. Bye.</i>

07:13.750 --> 07:17.510
- You know, Dr. Prijani didn't
even come into the office today?

07:17.587 --> 07:22.332
He had me push all his patients
into a three-day week.

07:22.350 --> 07:25.360
And he's making just as much
money as before.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.672
- Must be nice.

07:28.765 --> 07:31.357
- I know we always said
you would be a surgeon.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.359
You have such beautiful hands

07:33.512 --> 07:36.604
but maybe you should consider
dermatology.

07:36.698 --> 07:38.623
Most of the procedures take less
than two minutes,

07:38.700 --> 07:41.351
and there's none of that hassle
with insurance.

07:42.204 --> 07:44.204
- I thought you wanted me
to save lives.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.590
- What about melanoma?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.513
Did you take another
practice test?

08:00.797 --> 08:03.064
(sighs)

08:04.133 --> 08:07.152
(soft piano music)

08:42.097 --> 08:45.415
- The defendant, Samir Khalil.

08:45.417 --> 08:47.842
He'd like you to believe he's
a mild-mannered,

08:47.919 --> 08:49.510
hard-working, young man.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.697
A refugee from Syria,

08:52.924 --> 08:57.202
forced to flee his home country
when he was just 14.

08:57.353 --> 08:58.778
His lawyer will tell you
Mr. Khalil

08:58.930 --> 09:03.208
has no previous criminal record.
No history of violence.

09:03.359 --> 09:05.526
What he won't tell you

09:05.546 --> 09:09.439
is that Samir Khalil lived
a secret life.

09:10.125 --> 09:14.094
A secret life animated by rage
and obsession.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.088
One he kept hidden from
the world,

09:17.165 --> 09:22.477
until it metastasized into
something far worse.

09:24.472 --> 09:27.957
Mr. Khalil will tell you that
what happened was an accident.

09:27.976 --> 09:30.569
But the facts will prove
otherwise.

09:31.463 --> 09:35.723
He knows full well this was
no accident.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.059
What he did?

09:38.136 --> 09:40.120
It was murder.

09:41.230 --> 09:43.748
Plain and simple.

10:05.997 --> 10:09.357
(quiet typing)

10:20.011 --> 10:23.330
(eerie music)

10:24.032 --> 10:26.124
(typing getting louder)

10:30.446 --> 10:34.424
- You have 15 minutes
left on this section.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.599
(disturbing music)

10:47.481 --> 10:49.064
(clicking)

10:55.213 --> 10:58.031
(distorted sound)

11:03.221 --> 11:06.998
(muffled): Sir. Sir, you need
to sign out.

11:07.851 --> 11:09.058
(knocking)

11:09.060 --> 11:11.819
(laughing)

11:12.731 --> 11:14.898
- Mate! Wait, what are you
doing here?

11:14.900 --> 11:16.824
I thought you had your exam.

11:16.902 --> 11:19.010
Come in, come in. Come in.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.254
Uh, you remember Pete
and Shawna.

11:21.406 --> 11:22.755
- Hey, man.
- Hi, Samir.

11:23.332 --> 11:25.742
- This is Shawna's cousin,
Becky.

11:25.744 --> 11:27.394
- Hi, Becky.

11:28.212 --> 11:29.688
- Let's get you a beer.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.841
Here you go.
I'll get you a glass.

11:33.919 --> 11:35.342
(game playing on TV)

11:35.362 --> 11:38.012
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, mate.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.014
There's another half to go,
you know.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.258
What's going on?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.278
- I didn't finish.
(sighs)

11:45.430 --> 11:46.746
I couldn't.

11:48.433 --> 11:51.543
Two hours into the test,
I just got up and walked out.

11:51.694 --> 11:53.119
- Right.

11:53.196 --> 11:55.964
(phone chimes)

12:00.795 --> 12:02.536
(small scoff)

12:03.281 --> 12:05.223
- I thought I was ready
this time.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.560
It's like no matter what I do,
how hard I try...

12:08.636 --> 12:10.544
- Have you ever wondered
if maybe it's not meant to be?

12:10.564 --> 12:13.456
- What else would I do? Be a
driver the rest of my life?

12:13.475 --> 12:14.640
(dry chuckle)

12:14.793 --> 12:17.351
Sorry, I didn't mean...
- Nah, it's good, mate.

12:17.462 --> 12:20.146
All I'm saying is there's plenty
of ways to make a living.

12:20.223 --> 12:22.982
- You don't understand.
My mother...

12:23.651 --> 12:25.318
...she's given everything.

12:25.394 --> 12:28.471
- It's your life mate,
not hers.

12:29.307 --> 12:32.141
Now, listen, if it's not
happening, talk to her.

12:32.143 --> 12:33.918
Just tell her the truth.

12:34.070 --> 12:35.962
And in the meantime,

12:36.831 --> 12:39.299
let's try and get you laid.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.318
Hmm? Hey!

12:42.337 --> 12:43.820
Come on, Becky's here for
the week.

12:43.838 --> 12:46.473
She's fresh off a breakup.
The timing couldn't be better.

12:47.509 --> 12:49.416
You'll be all right,
silly sausage.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.345
Come on. Let's get back
to the game.

12:52.421 --> 12:54.013
That's it, mate.
That's it, mate!

12:54.165 --> 12:55.665
(Pete): Come on.
(Tom): That's it. Come on.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.442
(Pete): Let's go, let's go.
(Tom): Come on. Come on!

12:57.593 --> 12:59.685
(screaming)
What's wrong with you?!

12:59.838 --> 13:01.595
(Pete): Why are you like this?
(Tom): He's got two left feet!

13:01.615 --> 13:03.856
I'm telling you two left feet.
(Pete): Oh my god!

13:04.009 --> 13:05.099
(Tom): Told you.

13:05.176 --> 13:06.692
- Yeah, eight months

13:06.769 --> 13:08.953
and the whole time he was
cheating on me.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.604
And he totally gaslit me too.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.274
Anytime I thought he was,
you know, being sketchy.

13:13.368 --> 13:14.441
- It's rough out there, innit?

13:14.519 --> 13:15.776
- You're better off,
I'm telling you.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.128
- It just sucks like...
(phone buzzes)

13:17.355 --> 13:19.446
...he really got me, you know?

13:19.524 --> 13:21.190
Like even his Tinder profile,
before we even met,

13:21.192 --> 13:23.209
we had the same taste
in everything.

13:23.361 --> 13:24.527
We loved all the same stuff.

13:24.546 --> 13:25.878
- You see, it's the apps
that are the problem.

13:26.047 --> 13:28.714
It's too many options. Everyone
thinks they can do better.

13:28.867 --> 13:29.866
- I know I can.

13:29.884 --> 13:31.142
- Good luck with that one.
(laughing)

13:31.386 --> 13:36.297
- Honestly, all I want is a nice
guy who can make me laugh.

13:36.299 --> 13:38.708
Like, I don't even care about
anything else.

13:38.726 --> 13:40.309
(Samir chuckles)

13:40.895 --> 13:42.970
What?
- Nothing.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.656
- No, what were you gonna say?

13:45.383 --> 13:47.808
- Women always say that.
But it's crap.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.310
- Excuse me?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.663
- You don't want nice.
You don't even see nice.

13:51.739 --> 13:54.165
You just want flashy guys
who treat you badly

13:54.242 --> 13:59.504
and buy you things.
Like your ex, right?

14:03.902 --> 14:05.251
I should go.

14:05.328 --> 14:06.419
- You've had a few.
You shouldn't drive.

14:06.571 --> 14:08.162
- I gotta get home.
- No, no, no.

14:08.239 --> 14:09.906
Let me call you a ride.
You can get--

14:09.908 --> 14:11.516
- I said I'm fine!

14:14.003 --> 14:15.520
- Samir!

14:25.699 --> 14:29.016
- Why didn't you text me back?
I've been waiting for hours!

14:29.094 --> 14:30.276
- I met some friends.

14:30.428 --> 14:34.414
- Ah, you were celebrating.
It went well, then?

14:36.025 --> 14:37.041
- It went great.

14:37.118 --> 14:39.452
- Oh! I knew it. I just knew it.

14:39.604 --> 14:43.214
I told you, didn't I?
You just needed to focus.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.531
Apply yourself.

14:44.609 --> 14:47.777
- Oh, Mum, I'm tired.
I just want to sleep.

14:47.795 --> 14:48.761
- Okay.

14:49.464 --> 14:52.599
(soft piano music)

14:55.395 --> 14:58.521
Your father would be
very proud of you, Samir.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.293
(music intensifies)

16:01.035 --> 16:04.587

17:08.677 --> 17:10.695
- How was your flight?
- I'm just glad to be back.

17:10.772 --> 17:13.180
- Sorry, it's my own car today.
- Oh. That's okay.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.590
- Am I dropping you home?

17:14.592 --> 17:17.109
- No, I'm actually meeting
someone in Manhattan.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.662
East 86th Street.

17:22.525 --> 17:26.360
Oh God, at first it felt like
I was missing a limb.

17:26.379 --> 17:30.381
But I gotta say, it was kinda
nice not having it.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.866
You know, I read an actual
newspaper this morning.

17:32.944 --> 17:34.052
(engine starts)

17:34.220 --> 17:37.538
(♪ Tell Me Tell Me  by

17:37.557 --> 17:39.799
Wait, is that courtship.?
- Excuse me?

17:39.951 --> 17:40.999
- The music.

17:41.152 --> 17:42.209
- Sorry, I can turn it down.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.479
- No. No. Turn it up,
I love this band.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.565
- You know courtship.?
- Yeah.

17:48.293 --> 17:49.883
- I saw them a few months ago.

17:49.961 --> 17:51.402
- At Kaboo?
- Yeah!

17:51.629 --> 17:52.978
- I was there too.

17:53.055 --> 17:54.313
- Seriously? Wow.

17:54.465 --> 17:56.157
- Huh.

17:58.060 --> 18:00.469
- Yeah, it's three blocks down
from my favourite spot.

18:00.471 --> 18:04.248
Cafe Valeria.
- Shut up, I love that place.

18:04.325 --> 18:05.583
- Their gazpacho
is the best, right?

18:05.660 --> 18:09.829
- Oh my god. Yes,
the Persian cucumbers are...

18:09.905 --> 18:11.089
- Right. So good.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.257
- I can't believe you know
Cafe Valeria.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.742
That's... I mean, it's such
a hole in the wall.

18:16.487 --> 18:18.745
- I can't believe I've never
seen you there.

18:18.823 --> 18:20.056
I go all the time.

18:23.161 --> 18:25.269
And believe me,
I would have noticed.

18:25.421 --> 18:28.022
(♪♪)

18:34.689 --> 18:37.173
- Wow. That was fast.
- Traffic was light.

18:37.175 --> 18:39.342
- And I enjoyed
our conversation.

18:39.344 --> 18:41.786
Uh, just leave me right here.
This is good.

18:41.863 --> 18:42.745
- The hospital?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.545
- Thank you again.

18:53.191 --> 18:54.632
- Got your phone?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.117
- How much do I owe you?

18:57.195 --> 18:58.377
- Oh, you know what,
don't worry about it.

18:58.529 --> 19:00.120
On the house.
- Oh, absolutely not.

19:00.198 --> 19:01.547
- Please.
- No, I insist.

19:01.699 --> 19:04.049
- I had to use my own car.
You couldn't even stretch out.

19:04.126 --> 19:05.309
(chuckling)
- I don't care!

19:05.461 --> 19:06.218
Samir, please! I...

19:06.371 --> 19:08.220
- Friends and family discount.

19:08.964 --> 19:11.707
Tell you what, here's my card.

19:12.543 --> 19:14.986
It has my cell.
Next time you need a ride,

19:15.179 --> 19:17.822
you can make it up to me,
how's that?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.574
- Thank you.

19:23.738 --> 19:26.330
- And whoever you're visiting,
I hope they're okay.

19:26.407 --> 19:29.408
- Oh, I'm... I'm just having
lunch with a friend.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.377
- Well. Enjoy.

19:42.164 --> 19:45.433
(eerie music)

19:57.104 --> 19:59.572
(phone buzzes)

20:09.525 --> 20:11.600
- Please state your
name for the record.
- Thomas Braddick.

20:11.602 --> 20:14.420
- And what is your relationship
to the defendant?

20:15.864 --> 20:17.340
- We work together.

20:19.034 --> 20:20.376
He used to be my friend.

20:21.796 --> 20:25.431
- Did the defendant ever talk
to you about Alice Baylor?

20:26.451 --> 20:28.709
- No. He never mentioned her.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.396
- What about any other women
that he dated or was dating?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.107
Mr. Braddick?

20:36.961 --> 20:40.220
- Far as I know, he never had
a girlfriend.

20:40.314 --> 20:43.491
Samir... had a hard time
with women.

20:44.986 --> 20:46.244
- How did he feel about that?

20:46.395 --> 20:48.637
- Objection Your Honour.
Calls for speculation.

20:48.656 --> 20:49.914
- I'll rephrase.

20:50.065 --> 20:54.493
Did you ever hear Mr. Khalil
express any hostility

20:54.570 --> 20:56.462
toward women in general?

20:58.741 --> 21:00.299
- Sometimes...

21:01.410 --> 21:03.094
...when he drank,
he would get angry.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.653
(clears throat)

21:04.672 --> 21:09.725
He said women lied about
what they really wanted.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.730
That they made him feel
invisible.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.744
(sinister music)

21:37.188 --> 21:39.714
(phone buzzes)

21:41.876 --> 21:42.691
(sighs)

21:42.710 --> 21:43.709
- Hey.

21:43.952 --> 21:46.362
- Finally, mate. Where
the hell have you been?

21:46.364 --> 21:48.047
I've been trying you
for two days.

21:48.199 --> 21:49.657
- Look, I'm sorry about
the other night.

21:49.659 --> 21:52.292
<i> - No, no. We're good.</i>
<i> I was just, uh...</i>

21:52.386 --> 21:55.037
I was worried when I didn't hear
back from you.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.524
<i> How'd your mum take the news?</i>
<i> You told her, right?</i>

21:59.226 --> 21:59.817
- Yeah.

21:59.968 --> 22:01.444
- And?

22:02.971 --> 22:04.063
Samir?

22:04.215 --> 22:06.640
- She was fine. I mean...

22:06.717 --> 22:09.385
she wasn't exactly happy,
but she said she understood.

22:09.403 --> 22:10.310
(door opening)

22:10.330 --> 22:11.329
- That's a start, right?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.389
- Right.
- I told you she'd be okay.

22:13.391 --> 22:15.082
<i> I mean, she's your mum</i>
<i> after all.</i>

22:19.914 --> 22:21.589
<i> Samir?</i>

22:22.066 --> 22:23.549
Samir?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.596
(engine starts)

22:39.859 --> 22:41.650
- Hey, man.

22:43.104 --> 22:45.738
- Hey, uh...
- For Josh, right?

22:47.608 --> 22:50.442
- Right. Uh, uh... no.

22:51.262 --> 22:55.764
- Oh, shoot. Mine's still
on its way. Sorry.

22:55.783 --> 22:56.916
- Um, I can take you.

22:58.269 --> 23:01.712
I mean, if you cancel yours
and re-enter it...

23:01.864 --> 23:03.606
I'm between rides.

23:03.624 --> 23:05.549
- I'm going all the way
to Westchester.

23:05.776 --> 23:06.609
- It's fine.

23:06.702 --> 23:09.053
- He's seven minutes away, so...

23:09.130 --> 23:11.138
yeah, let me cancel.

23:17.972 --> 23:20.523
- Headed home?
- Yeah.

23:23.127 --> 23:24.476
- Fun night?

23:24.629 --> 23:26.629
- It was all right.

23:26.889 --> 23:29.532
(eerie music)

23:33.228 --> 23:34.970
- So what kind of work
do you do?

23:34.989 --> 23:36.989
(Josh sighs)

23:37.065 --> 23:38.657
- Orthopedics.

23:39.234 --> 23:40.534
- You're a doctor.

23:41.162 --> 23:43.212
- Orthopedic surgeon.

23:44.573 --> 23:47.591
I've had a long day,
you mind if I close my eyes?

24:09.857 --> 24:11.991
Uh, this is good. Thanks.

24:17.031 --> 24:19.415
(♪♪)

24:34.882 --> 24:36.548
(doorbell rings)

24:36.701 --> 24:39.518
(footsteps approaching)

24:41.388 --> 24:43.439
- Did I leave something
in your car?

24:47.728 --> 24:49.211
What's up?

24:49.230 --> 24:51.155
I tipped 18 percent.

24:51.306 --> 24:52.715
I gave you five stars.

24:52.733 --> 24:54.116
- Does she know?

24:55.052 --> 24:56.068
- Excuse me?

24:56.220 --> 24:59.054
- Alice Baylor.
Does she know?

24:59.056 --> 25:01.624
- What... the hell.
- Daddy?

25:03.561 --> 25:04.576
Who's at the door?

25:04.729 --> 25:06.003
- Uh, it's no one, sweetie.

25:06.121 --> 25:07.171
I just left something
in my Lyft.

25:07.248 --> 25:09.048
I'll be right back.

25:11.660 --> 25:12.918
You need to leave right now.

25:12.995 --> 25:13.844
- Or what?

25:13.921 --> 25:15.179
- Or I'm calling the police.

25:15.756 --> 25:18.516
- What are you going to tell
your wife when they get here?

25:19.685 --> 25:21.260
- You want money?
Is that it?

25:21.336 --> 25:23.020
- No, I don't want money.

25:23.247 --> 25:25.439
I want Alice to be happy.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.274
She deserves it.

25:28.677 --> 25:32.755
- I've got your license buddy.
I can get you fired.

25:32.757 --> 25:33.772
- Do it.

25:34.608 --> 25:37.993
But either you tell Alice
the truth or I will.

25:39.764 --> 25:41.413
Your call.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.547
(birds chirping)

25:59.875 --> 26:02.726
(foreboding music)

26:14.389 --> 26:16.465
(Alice): These floors are
actually original.

26:16.483 --> 26:20.652
Um, this is actually a marble
the last owners had imported.

26:21.305 --> 26:24.081
It's a 20-minute ride
to the city

26:24.083 --> 26:26.308
but also 20 minutes from the
botanical gardens

26:26.327 --> 26:29.978
so you have the option to have
both of those

26:29.997 --> 26:31.422
right in your backyard.

26:31.573 --> 26:33.332
Um, so you have the set-up
and the comps.

26:33.484 --> 26:35.150
Let me know if you
anymore questions.

26:35.152 --> 26:37.094
- Thank you.
- Okay.

26:40.674 --> 26:43.434
Hi, do you have any questions?

26:43.510 --> 26:45.661
Oh my god, Samir?

26:46.421 --> 26:49.398
- I was driving by and I saw
your name on the sign.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.567
- That's crazy.

26:52.612 --> 26:55.187
Were you dropping someone off?

26:56.098 --> 26:58.282
- Oh, no,
I'm not working today.

26:58.359 --> 26:59.283
It's only a part-time thing.

26:59.434 --> 27:00.509
Till I start med school
in the fall.

27:00.527 --> 27:03.345
- Wait, you're going
to medical school?

27:04.181 --> 27:07.032
- Columbia.
- Columbia, that's...

27:07.109 --> 27:09.960
that's amazing.
Good for you.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.708
- Okay, I, uh, I lied.

27:16.861 --> 27:19.637
- Oh.
- I wasn't just driving by.

27:20.547 --> 27:24.350
The truth is, when we met,
I don't know,

27:25.460 --> 27:27.703
it felt like we had a lot
in common.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.039
I couldn't stop thinking
about you. I...

27:31.725 --> 27:34.042
I found your website,
with all your listings.

27:34.061 --> 27:36.445
I saw this open house.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.489
(sighs)

27:38.716 --> 27:41.325
Saying it out loud,
it sounds a little creepy.

27:41.476 --> 27:42.901
- A little.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.405
- Right. You're right.

27:46.481 --> 27:47.998
I'm so sorry.

27:48.150 --> 27:50.000
- Also flattering.

27:53.155 --> 27:55.172
- You're probably
seeing someone.

27:55.282 --> 27:59.751
- Uh...no, actually.

27:59.828 --> 28:02.012
I was, but...

28:02.907 --> 28:03.830
- I'm sorry.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.090
- It is what it is.

28:05.167 --> 28:06.909
(woman): Alice, uh,
when you have a second.

28:06.911 --> 28:08.560
- Um.

28:11.081 --> 28:14.583
- Well, if you ever wanna...

28:14.601 --> 28:17.010
I don't know,
get dinner or something,

28:17.087 --> 28:19.655
you have my number.
No pressure.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.257
- You got plans Friday?

28:22.259 --> 28:24.350
- Friday? Yeah, sure.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.538
I mean no, I don't,
I mean Friday's great.

28:27.765 --> 28:29.331
- Okay.

28:30.692 --> 28:32.418
Excuse me.

28:34.438 --> 28:38.465
Hi. You ready to go
upstairs? Okay.

28:49.878 --> 28:51.377
Wow.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.065
New car?
- Yeah, I traded in my old one.

28:55.142 --> 28:57.383
- I'd say you traded up.

28:57.461 --> 29:00.145
- You're wondering how
a driver can afford it?

29:00.222 --> 29:01.721
- No, I wasn't.

29:01.815 --> 29:04.390
- I actually inherited some
money recently.

29:04.468 --> 29:06.893
I had an uncle who passed away.

29:06.971 --> 29:08.495
- I'm so sorry.

29:09.156 --> 29:10.822
- I barely knew him.

29:10.899 --> 29:12.583
(chuckling)

29:12.734 --> 29:14.643
What's so funny?
- No, nothing.

29:14.661 --> 29:17.737
I just... I wasn't sure I'd be
riding up front with you.

29:18.332 --> 29:20.716
- If you want,
you can ride in the back.

29:24.338 --> 29:27.014
(soft music)
(chattering)

29:28.008 --> 29:29.324
- Oh, you know what?

29:29.326 --> 29:30.416
The three- bean stew sounds
really good.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.585
I haven't seen that
on the menu before.

29:32.663 --> 29:34.104
- Yeah, it's great.

29:34.181 --> 29:36.331
- I'm not really a big
escarole fan.

29:36.333 --> 29:39.759
- Me neither, but it works
with the chili and rosemary.

29:39.853 --> 29:42.029
Chef's a magician.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.264
- Hi, are you ready to order?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.024
- A couple more minutes, please.

29:46.101 --> 29:47.993
- Of course. Take your time.

29:50.864 --> 29:54.215
- Thanks for this.
I really needed it.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.868
- I'm surprised
you didn't have plans.

29:56.945 --> 30:00.464
- I was supposed to go upstate
with a couple of girlfriends.

30:00.541 --> 30:03.449
There was this new spa retreat
we wanted to try.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.952
But it just felt like
the whole thing

30:06.030 --> 30:08.030
was gonna be a pity party.

30:08.032 --> 30:10.415
- You mean... the breakup?

30:11.201 --> 30:13.718
- Yeah. It was fairly recent.

30:13.795 --> 30:14.978
- What happened?

30:15.130 --> 30:16.872
- You really wanna know?

30:17.465 --> 30:19.632
- Only if you feel like
talking about it.

30:19.710 --> 30:23.395
- We met at a bar,
like eight months ago.

30:23.471 --> 30:25.322
Insane chemistry,
right off the bat.

30:25.399 --> 30:27.899
I thought it was charming he
didn't have social media.

30:28.052 --> 30:30.052
Turns out, he had a wife.

30:30.070 --> 30:31.495
And kids.

30:32.056 --> 30:33.388
- How'd you find out?

30:33.390 --> 30:37.075
- Uh, he finally came clean.
Just out of the blue.

30:37.227 --> 30:39.394
I mean, he said he wanted
to leave her

30:39.396 --> 30:41.746
but he needed time and...

30:41.748 --> 30:42.914
- And you ended it?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.567
- Yes, of course.
I mean...

30:45.569 --> 30:48.570
he keeps trying and even if he's
serious, it's just...

30:48.589 --> 30:50.572
I keep thinking like,
how do you recover

30:50.574 --> 30:54.518
from something like that? How do
you recover from a lie that big?

30:56.188 --> 30:57.929
I'm sorry. I don't...
- No.

30:58.082 --> 30:59.398
- ...it's TMI.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.343
It's just what I always do.

31:03.362 --> 31:08.423
I fall for these older guys
who are mysterious, aloof.

31:08.442 --> 31:09.925
Unavailable.

31:10.518 --> 31:15.664
- Well, maybe you're ready
for something different.

31:17.859 --> 31:19.025
(chuckles)

31:19.527 --> 31:21.953
- You testified that Mr. Khalil
expressed animosity

31:22.106 --> 31:24.456
and resentment toward women.

31:24.532 --> 31:27.885
Did you ever see him act out
physically?

31:27.961 --> 31:29.720
Resort to violence?

31:30.872 --> 31:31.947
- No.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.632
- Not once?

31:34.209 --> 31:36.685
In the history
of your friendship?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.688
- I guess he kept it
bottled up.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.651
Some people just snap,
you know?

31:46.463 --> 31:49.889
He never talked much about
what he saw as a kid,

31:50.634 --> 31:52.075
but it didn't take
a genius to see

31:52.227 --> 31:54.328
there was probably some trauma.

31:56.657 --> 31:58.323
(knocking)

31:58.475 --> 32:01.101
- Yes?
- Hi, uh, Mrs. Khalil?

32:01.103 --> 32:02.811
I'm Tom Braddick,
Samir's friend.

32:02.829 --> 32:04.496
- Oh yes, from work.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.498
He's talked so much about you.

32:06.574 --> 32:09.125
- He's told me a lot
about you too.

32:09.202 --> 32:10.719
- Please, come in.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.748
- I'm, uh, I'm so sorry to show
up like this.

32:15.768 --> 32:18.326
Is... is he here? I've been
trying to reach him and...

32:18.345 --> 32:20.178
- No, he's working tonight.

32:20.255 --> 32:21.513
- Is that what he told you?

32:21.665 --> 32:25.317
- It's not what he told me,
it's what he's doing.

32:26.261 --> 32:28.261
Why are you asking me that?

32:29.264 --> 32:31.506
- Samir hasn't been to work
in three weeks.

32:32.434 --> 32:35.202
He dropped off his car
and his keys without a word.

32:35.770 --> 32:36.861
- That's absurd.

32:36.938 --> 32:38.956
- He won't return my calls
or my texts--

32:39.107 --> 32:41.516
- No, he's been driving
constantly.

32:41.535 --> 32:43.126
He wants to save as much
as he can

32:43.278 --> 32:45.462
before he starts medical school
in the fall.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.447
- Medical school?

32:47.782 --> 32:49.341
- Yes, of course.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.594
What?

32:53.197 --> 32:54.620
What's going on?

32:55.365 --> 32:57.140
- What's up, Brooklyn!
We're courtship.

32:57.292 --> 32:59.643
Thanks so much for comin' out.

it's late.
Why aren't you asleep?

34:24.063 --> 34:25.437
- I've been calling you.

34:27.991 --> 34:29.524
All night.

34:30.961 --> 34:33.386
- I'm sorry, I was busy.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.145
- Doing what?

34:34.298 --> 34:35.797
- Driving. I told you.

34:35.799 --> 34:39.801
- I know what you told me,
what you've been telling me.

34:40.470 --> 34:42.245
Now I want you to tell me
the truth.

34:42.322 --> 34:44.489
Your friend Tom was here.

34:45.659 --> 34:48.502
He came looking for you because
he was worried.

34:49.830 --> 34:50.979
So am I.

34:50.997 --> 34:52.672
- Well, don't be.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.592
- He says you quit your job.

34:56.837 --> 34:59.321
He says you didn't even finish
taking your test?

34:59.323 --> 35:01.323
- Mumma, it's too late and I'm
too tired to do this now.

35:01.341 --> 35:02.674
- And then there's the money.

35:02.826 --> 35:06.252
Ten thousand dollars is missing
from the account Samir.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.088
Ten thousand dollars!
I called the bank.

35:09.090 --> 35:10.348
I said it must be some kind
of fraud.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.425
They said, no, it's not fraud.
They said it was you.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.362
- Well, I earned half
that money,

35:15.948 --> 35:17.672
more than half.

35:17.691 --> 35:19.841
- It's money we've been saving
for your tuition, Samir!

35:19.843 --> 35:23.120
- I'm not going to medical
school anymore, okay? It's over.

35:23.196 --> 35:25.605
- How can you say that?
What will you be?

35:25.682 --> 35:28.350
What will you do?
Who will you be?

35:28.368 --> 35:29.775
- I'm trying to figure that out.

35:29.795 --> 35:30.794
- So that's it?

35:30.871 --> 35:32.129
I brought you to this country,

35:32.280 --> 35:35.023
I sacrificed my life so you
could throw yours away?

35:35.025 --> 35:36.358
- I'm not throwing away
my life.

35:36.376 --> 35:38.969
- Yeah, what are you doing?
- I'm living it!

35:39.045 --> 35:41.655
For once. Okay?

35:42.624 --> 35:44.957
I met a woman.
She's amazing. I love her.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.292
(laughing)

35:46.311 --> 35:48.294
- An amazing woman? Really?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.980
- Why is that so hard
to believe?

35:50.056 --> 35:51.389
- How amazing can she be

35:51.483 --> 35:53.558
if she's serious about someone
with no real prospects.

35:53.710 --> 35:55.710
- You don't know her.
- Does she know you?

35:55.712 --> 35:57.487
Does she know you live with
your mother?

35:57.564 --> 35:59.714
Does she know you lie
to your mother?

35:59.716 --> 36:01.825
- Shut up!
- Does she know you steal
from her?

36:02.018 --> 36:02.884
- Shut up!

36:02.903 --> 36:04.402
- Stop it!
(clattering)

36:04.554 --> 36:06.496
Stop it, Samir.
Where are you going?

36:06.648 --> 36:08.331
Samir!
- I'm not a child, Mumma!

36:08.408 --> 36:12.669
- No, you're a liar.
You're a criminal. A coward!

36:12.746 --> 36:14.504
Samir!

36:15.490 --> 36:18.592
(foreboding music)

36:29.095 --> 36:32.063
(doorbell rings)

36:35.009 --> 36:36.008
<i> (Alice): Yes?</i>

36:36.028 --> 36:38.361
- Hi. It's me.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.031
<i> - Uh, Samir?</i>

36:41.107 --> 36:45.327
- I know it's late,
but can we talk?

36:47.764 --> 36:49.122
Alice?

36:50.100 --> 36:52.584
<i> - Okay, I'll be right out.</i>

36:58.032 --> 36:59.107
Hi.
- Hi.

36:59.125 --> 37:00.533
- Um, what are you doing here?

37:00.627 --> 37:03.945
- I had such a nice time
tonight. I couldn't sleep.

37:03.964 --> 37:05.055
- You could have called.

37:05.131 --> 37:07.131
- I had to see you.
Can I come in?

37:07.284 --> 37:08.892
- Uh, no, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

37:08.969 --> 37:12.454
- I know it's crazy but what
if we went away for the weekend?

37:12.456 --> 37:13.546
The retreat you mentioned
upstate.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.732
- Okay, Samir, look.
- I can pay for it.

37:15.883 --> 37:17.008
- Samir, please.
- Money's no issue.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.142
- Please, please. Just...

37:18.237 --> 37:20.570
I need you to listen to me.
Okay? I...

37:22.908 --> 37:24.223
there's no easy way to say this

37:24.243 --> 37:26.301
so I'm just...
I'm gonna say it.

37:27.228 --> 37:29.137
I've really enjoyed getting
to know you

37:29.155 --> 37:30.989
and you've been a very
good friend.

37:31.065 --> 37:32.307
- A good friend?

37:32.325 --> 37:34.459
- Look, the truth is,
is that...

37:35.996 --> 37:37.145
Oh God.

37:37.163 --> 37:38.329
- What's goin' on?
- Go wait inside.

37:38.406 --> 37:40.740
- Look. This is...
this is Josh.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.178
He was waiting for me when I got
home and we talked things out.

37:46.156 --> 37:47.413
He left his wife, okay?

37:47.491 --> 37:49.007
And we're gonna try to make
it work.

37:49.159 --> 37:50.416
- No.
- Samir, I'm sorry.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.102
This is what I want.
- You heard her, buddy.

37:52.253 --> 37:53.495
- No, he's lying!

37:53.588 --> 37:55.163
- Hey, I'm warning you.

37:55.181 --> 37:57.849
- He was never gonna tell you!
I made him do it!

37:58.001 --> 37:59.442
- Wait. What?

37:59.519 --> 38:00.518
- Okay, look.

38:00.595 --> 38:02.428
- I'm sorry.
You two know each other?

38:02.506 --> 38:05.189
- Alice, listen, this guy is
dangerous.

38:05.266 --> 38:07.342
He was stalking you.
- It wasn't like that.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.435
- He was parked right there one
night when I came out.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.104
He must've been watching you.
He drove me home.

38:12.124 --> 38:15.199
- To his wife and kids!
I made him do it.

38:15.352 --> 38:16.442
You think that was
his conscience?

38:16.461 --> 38:18.611
- Yeah, he tried to threaten me.
Extort me.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.672
- No. I was protecting you!

38:22.042 --> 38:23.449
- You both need to leave.
- Alice, wait.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.709
- No.
- You can't trust him!

38:24.861 --> 38:27.554
- For God's sake. Just hold on.
- Just leave her.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.599
(grunting)

38:33.736 --> 38:35.127
- Come near me or Alice again

38:35.147 --> 38:37.731
and I will kill you,
you understand?

38:39.759 --> 38:42.569
(muffled)

38:43.155 --> 38:46.047
Alice! Let me in!

38:46.049 --> 38:48.974
Alice! Come on. Let me in!

38:49.052 --> 38:50.976
Alice!
(effort grunts)

38:50.996 --> 38:53.888
Hey! I'm not leaving!

38:54.023 --> 38:56.816
Okay? I'm not going anywhere!

38:56.835 --> 38:59.727
Alice! Please open the door.

38:59.729 --> 39:01.671
Come on. Please.

39:02.732 --> 39:04.257
Alice!

39:05.010 --> 39:07.402
(thud)
Happy, you freak?

39:07.404 --> 39:09.095
Oh, now you're scared, huh?

39:10.331 --> 39:11.514
Get out!

39:12.242 --> 39:14.642
(thudding)
Get out!

39:15.929 --> 39:18.096
(engine starts)

39:18.748 --> 39:20.732
Where do you think you're going?
(glass shatters)

39:23.420 --> 39:25.920
What'd you gonna do?! Huh?

39:25.922 --> 39:28.490
Where you gonna go? Huh?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.259
Be a man!

39:31.277 --> 39:33.261
Come on, get out.

39:33.279 --> 39:35.113
Freak!

39:35.448 --> 39:36.931
(tires screech)

39:36.950 --> 39:39.084
(impact)

39:49.112 --> 39:50.887
(door opening)

39:50.964 --> 39:53.223
(quiet chatter)

39:53.374 --> 39:54.799
(Bailiff): Do you swear to tell
the truth,

39:54.951 --> 39:57.227
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you God?

39:57.729 --> 39:59.062
(Rita): I do.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.900
- Would you please state
your name for the record?

40:04.403 --> 40:05.718
- Rita Khalil.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.613
- And what is your relationship
to the defendant?

40:09.799 --> 40:10.740
- He's my son.

40:12.652 --> 40:13.868
- Mrs. Khalil,

40:14.638 --> 40:15.637
would you tell the court

40:15.897 --> 40:18.540
what brought you and your son
to this country?

40:20.160 --> 40:23.068
- My husband, Samir's father,

40:23.830 --> 40:28.591
he was a doctor at a public
hospital in Aleppo.

40:28.743 --> 40:30.668
When the conflict broke out,

40:30.745 --> 40:35.306
he insisted that I take Samir
to the town of Sarmada.

40:36.584 --> 40:39.844
Three weeks later,
his hospital was hit.

40:39.996 --> 40:41.479
He was killed in the bombing.

40:44.350 --> 40:46.443
I brought Samir to this country

40:46.594 --> 40:49.404
so he could have the best
possible education.

40:50.690 --> 40:53.575
He wanted to follow in his
father's footsteps.

40:57.197 --> 40:58.663
At least, that's what I thought.

41:01.275 --> 41:03.585
Maybe I pushed him too hard.

41:04.278 --> 41:06.463
Maybe it's my fault.

41:08.875 --> 41:12.451
- Mrs. Khalil,
your son has admitted

41:12.471 --> 41:15.546
to running over Joshua Donovan
with his car

41:15.623 --> 41:17.957
which resulted
in Mr. Donovan's death.

41:18.034 --> 41:19.050
- That's...

41:19.644 --> 41:24.147
...an unspeakable tragedy.
He will never forgive himself.

41:24.298 --> 41:26.983
- But your son is being tried
for murder.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.735
Which requires intent.

41:30.730 --> 41:35.216
Do you believe it was your son's
intention to murder Mr. Donovan?

41:35.235 --> 41:36.809
- I know it wasn't.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.620
- How can you be sure?

41:39.239 --> 41:40.538
- He's just a boy.

41:42.225 --> 41:44.225
He's never been in a fight.

41:44.894 --> 41:47.745
He's never even lived
on his own.

41:47.897 --> 41:49.154
(shuddering breath)

41:49.174 --> 41:52.917
When he left that night,
he was agitated.

41:52.994 --> 41:54.585
He wasn't himself.

41:55.739 --> 42:00.091
It was an accident.
It was a terrible accident.

42:00.167 --> 42:02.093
But I know my son.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.646
And he's not a murderer.

42:06.266 --> 42:08.024
He doesn't have it in him.

42:10.270 --> 42:12.654
- Thank you, Mrs. Khalil.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.406
Nothing further.

42:16.092 --> 42:18.409
(quiet sobbing)

42:22.523 --> 42:24.448
(Judge): Has the jury reached
a verdict?

42:25.101 --> 42:26.292
- We have, Your Honour.

42:28.063 --> 42:29.620
(Judge): What say you?

42:30.456 --> 42:32.940
- On the count or Murder
in the Second Degree,

42:32.942 --> 42:36.702
we find the defendant,
Samir Khalil, guilty.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.629
(whispering)

42:39.558 --> 42:41.282
- Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

42:41.301 --> 42:43.542
you are dismissed
with the court's thanks.

42:43.562 --> 42:46.545
The defendant will be remanded
to custody pending sentencing.

42:46.565 --> 42:48.139
We are now adjourned.
(gavel bang)

42:48.291 --> 42:49.232
(Bailiff): All rise.

42:49.309 --> 42:51.142
- No.
- Ma'am, I'm sorry,

42:51.218 --> 42:53.218
you're not allowed--
- I'm sorry, Mumma.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.296
- It's okay, baby.
We'll file an appeal.

42:55.298 --> 42:56.906
We'll get...
we'll get a better lawyer.

42:56.983 --> 42:58.891
- Ma'am. Ma'am.
- Hey!

42:58.968 --> 43:00.468
Don't touch her! Let her go!

43:00.486 --> 43:02.412
- It's okay.
- Leave her alone!

43:02.563 --> 43:04.639
- It's okay.
- Mumma!

43:04.774 --> 43:06.541
- Samir.
- Mumma!

43:11.164 --> 43:15.008
Subtitling: difuze
