00:01.202 --> 00:04.503
Narrator: Now on
"ice road truckers"...

00:04.505 --> 00:06.872
Art: So far I'd say this
is the worst road yet.

00:06.874 --> 00:07.606
- I've never been on them,

00:07.608 --> 00:09.274
I don't know what to expect.

00:09.276 --> 00:13.379
Narrator: ...The drivers take on
new frontiers.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.914
- I can see how they call this
the death road.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.416
- I'm on the road!

00:17.418 --> 00:19.351
Narrator: New blood...

00:19.353 --> 00:20.953
- Holy (bleep)!

00:21.288 --> 00:23.689
- Welcome to the ice road, baby.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.923
Narrator: And...

00:24.925 --> 00:26.025
- It was somewheres around here

00:26.027 --> 00:27.259
Where I almost went through.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.161
Narrator: ...And an old nemesis.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.797
- I gotta be (bleep)
to be doing this.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.799
Narrator: The ice road truckers
could be facing

01:06.801 --> 01:09.701
Their warmest and shortest
season on record.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.772
Open trails could be closed
at any time.

01:15.142 --> 01:18.777
And some roads may never
open at all.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.749
So the company's are doing
what they can to survive.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.186
Darrell: Alberta's a long ways
from here.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.221
Narrator: For darrell and lisa

01:29.223 --> 01:33.492
That means expanding the map
into a new province.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.195
- You got them loaded up
and ready to go?

01:36.197 --> 01:39.198
Long ways to alberta
but I'm on it.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.268
All right, yep thanks, bye.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.938
- Fort chip, alberta.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.172
- P.

01:47.174 --> 01:50.175
It may be a long ways away
but it pays good.
- Okay.

01:50.177 --> 01:52.578
- I don't know what the road
conditions like up there.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.247
Stories I've heard is
it's a very rough road.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.153
We got this new contract
going to alberta.

02:01.155 --> 02:04.389
It gives us the opportunity
to expand into a new province,

02:04.391 --> 02:06.125
Grow this company.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.127
Well, let's get out of here.
Alberta.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.230
It's gonna be a long drive.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.665
I've heard these roads
are real dangerous,

02:13.667 --> 02:16.301
But we're gonna take the risk
to make this company survive.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.303
(truck doors shut)

02:19.206 --> 02:21.840
Narrator: Darrell and lisa
will be venturing farther

02:21.842 --> 02:23.976
Than they've ever been before.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.811
Hauling 50 tons of heating
supplies

02:25.813 --> 02:28.180
Over 1000 miles from winnipeg

02:28.182 --> 02:30.215
To distant fort chipewyan

02:30.217 --> 02:33.886
Over a trail nicknamed
the death road.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.187
(chains clink)

02:36.090 --> 02:37.389
- I've never been on 'em.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.224
I don't know what to expect

02:39.226 --> 02:42.394
But these communities
depend on it.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.097
I depend on it; this trucking
company depends on it.

02:45.099 --> 02:48.600
Narrator: Traveling this far for
a company with a two truck fleet

02:48.602 --> 02:50.435
Could be an overreach,

02:50.437 --> 02:51.904
But if they pull it off

02:51.906 --> 02:54.506
It'll be their biggest
payout to date.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.743
- Hope for the best.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.416
Narrator: Back in winnipeg...

03:04.418 --> 03:06.251
- Good to go.

03:06.253 --> 03:10.122
Narrator: ...Polar is looking
to expand their team.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.124
Just days ago...

03:13.561 --> 03:15.561
- Don't let me down.
I'm gonna give you a shot.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.297
- Yeah. Awesome, thank you.
- All right? Welcome aboard.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.666
Narrator: ...22-year-old
steph custance,

03:20.668 --> 03:24.336
Finally got the green light
to join the ice roads battle.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.373
Mark: It's a short season
and uh,

03:28.375 --> 03:29.975
I've gotta get loads moving fast

03:29.977 --> 03:31.376
And I need all the drivers
I can get.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.378
I'm gonna take a chance on,
on steph.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.482
Narrator: Now the rookies
gearing up for her first run,

03:37.484 --> 03:40.986
But she won't be flying solo.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.921
- Todd?
- Yeah.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.157
- Hey, steph.
- Stephanie. Nice to meet ya.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.092
- Yeah, I'll be convoying
out with you.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.227
Narrator: She'll be learning
from polar's best,

03:48.229 --> 03:51.296
Company top dog, todd dewey.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.765
- You know what you signed up
for?

03:53.767 --> 03:56.301
- I don't really know exactly
what to expect.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.904
- Well, you're in for one hell
of a rodeo then, aren't ya?

04:00.140 --> 04:04.409
My first impression of
stephanie is she's a rookie

04:04.411 --> 04:06.211
With zero experience.

04:06.213 --> 04:10.249
That's a recipe for nothing
but disaster.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.351
You know, it's hard to say
how dangerous it's gonna be.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.987
It's dangerous no matter what.
- Yeah.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.188
- But with the weather
we're having this year

04:16.190 --> 04:17.256
And everything that's going on,

04:17.258 --> 04:20.259
I-I'm nervous about it myself.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.629
- I have no idea what to expect.

04:23.631 --> 04:27.633
I don't know what's coming
but I'm excited.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.601
Whatever man, let's go,
hammer down.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.371
- So let's hit the road.
Let's get out of here and uh,

04:32.373 --> 04:34.306
See what hells gonna throw
our way this year.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.507
- Okay.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.009
- Sounds good, steph.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.411
Narrator: The convoy's mission:

04:41.181 --> 04:44.416
Retrieve two trailers that
were forced to be abandoned
last winter.

04:46.186 --> 04:49.488
But to get them
todd and steph must travel

04:49.490 --> 04:52.891
500 grueling miles
to shamattawa,

04:52.893 --> 04:54.693
One of the most remote
destinations

04:54.695 --> 04:56.161
On the manitoba winter roads.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.897
- Here we go. Are you ready
to roll?

04:58.899 --> 05:01.700
- (bleep) right.
Todd: (on radio) okay dokey.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.670
Narrator: It's an assignment
that would be a challenge
for a veteran,

05:04.672 --> 05:08.206
But for a rookie
it'll be a trial by fire.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.175
- Got a little spunk to her
I'll tell you that.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.244
We'll see how she feels
at the end of the day

05:12.246 --> 05:14.446
Or should I say at the end
of the trip.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.983
- Out on the open road.
(bleep) yeah.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.523
I'm doing it. (laughs)

05:24.525 --> 05:26.191
(bleep) doing it.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.794
Narrator: While the newcomer
heads out on her first trip,

05:30.331 --> 05:32.531
400 miles to the northeast...

05:34.134 --> 05:35.300
(truck rattles)

05:36.303 --> 05:38.070
- (bleep)

05:38.405 --> 05:40.505
Narrator: ...The company
wild card

05:40.507 --> 05:43.342
Is putting his veteran skills
to the test.

05:43.344 --> 05:48.380
Art: ♪ rock a my baby
in the old truck ♪

05:48.382 --> 05:52.284
♪ everything here
will all beat to (bleep) ♪

05:53.287 --> 05:55.387
Narrator: Art burke's headed
down one of the most

05:55.389 --> 05:58.490
Notorious trials
in all of ontario.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.793
- I'm off to sachigo lake
this morning

06:01.795 --> 06:03.562
With a load of building
supplies.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.933
It's pretty heavy I can tell
by the feel.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.035
I'd say we're maxing right
to the (bleep).

06:10.037 --> 06:11.503
It's a heavy load.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.308
Narrator: Sachigo lake falls
on the outskirts of the winter
road system

06:16.310 --> 06:19.478
Over 500 rugged miles
from winnipeg.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.249
(truck rattles)

06:24.251 --> 06:27.486
- So far I say this is
the worst road yet.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.288
(truck rattles)

06:32.893 --> 06:33.325
Yet.

06:35.396 --> 06:38.730
Narrator: The route's littered
with uneven hills

06:38.732 --> 06:41.166
And punishing rocks that
are breaking through

06:41.168 --> 06:43.535
Under the crumbling muskeg.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.272
(truck rattles)

06:47.274 --> 06:48.373
Art: I don't wanna get
stuck in here,

06:48.375 --> 06:50.175
Cause if you get stuck

06:50.177 --> 06:52.377
God knows how long
you're stuck.

06:52.379 --> 06:56.081
Narrator: This season
the deteriorating roads

06:56.083 --> 06:58.316
Have already stopped drivers
in their tracks.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.453
- I can't (bleep) around,
can't (bleep) around.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.622
Narrator: And no one knows
it more than art...

07:04.792 --> 07:05.490
- Hang on here.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.993
(truck smashes)
whoa!

07:10.130 --> 07:12.330
Narrator: ...Who was stranded
for nearly 24 hours

07:12.332 --> 07:14.099
On his first trip.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.367
- Well, isn't this wonderful?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.671
(chains clink)

07:19.673 --> 07:21.306
(bleep).

07:21.308 --> 07:22.307
(bleep) christ.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.342
(truck rattles)

07:24.344 --> 07:26.812
Oh my goodness, b'y.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.647
I can look forward to...

07:29.683 --> 07:31.349
I don't know how many hours
of this.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.454
I guess there's a bright side
to this:

07:35.456 --> 07:37.389
If I ever get on one of them
(bleep) electrical bulls

07:37.391 --> 07:40.158
I'll be able to hang on
like a bastard.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.295
(truck engine roars)

07:44.331 --> 07:48.400
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.371
Well, I've come to this fork
in the road.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.075
Here we go again, eh.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.978
Narrator: From here there
are two ways

07:59.980 --> 08:02.013
To get to sachigo lake.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.618
A longer path with plenty
of extra rocky miles

08:06.620 --> 08:10.589
And a shorter one but loaded
with a three mile ice crossing.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.395
- This looks like the spot
last year

08:21.435 --> 08:23.935
And last year I went that way

08:24.972 --> 08:27.606
And that's where I almost
went through the ice.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.043
Art: Whoa!

08:32.045 --> 08:33.478
(ice cracking, water gurgling)

08:34.248 --> 08:36.915
Broke through the (bleep) ice,
man.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.117
(tires spinning)

08:44.091 --> 08:46.925
It's almost like flipping
a coin, kind of thing, right.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.233
Which way do I go here?

09:02.376 --> 09:04.142
(truck door slam)

09:06.580 --> 09:07.979
So...

09:11.118 --> 09:12.450
If I cross that piece of ice,

09:12.452 --> 09:15.520
Road's are way shorter, eh.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.428
So I'm gonna try it
and see what happens.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.464
Narrator: Art makes the call:

09:26.466 --> 09:28.333
He'll face off with the crossing

09:28.335 --> 09:30.435
That nearly cost him his life
last season.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.406
- If I'm sorry I did this,
well, I'll be sorry I did this.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.584
Narrator: Deep in the canadian
wilderness...

09:47.721 --> 09:49.187
(truck rattles)

09:52.426 --> 09:54.559
- I'm on the road!

09:54.561 --> 09:55.927
I'm on the winter road.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.330
We're (bleep) heading
to shamattawa, bud.

09:58.332 --> 10:01.399
- This is your big debut
right here, girl.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.301
This is what you've been
waiting for.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.971
Narrator: Polar's convoy
of todd dewey

10:05.973 --> 10:07.639
And rookie steph custance

10:07.641 --> 10:10.542
Are pushing down one of the
toughest roads in manitoba.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.414
- It's a good feeling to...

10:17.417 --> 10:19.351
Be here,

10:19.353 --> 10:22.120
It's a good feeling to be here.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.390
Every (bleep) bump is a good
feeling to be here.

10:26.994 --> 10:27.993
(truck rattles)

10:27.995 --> 10:30.562
This means a lot;
this is money for my kid.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.999
Everything I do in my life
is for my kid.

10:35.936 --> 10:36.801
- Keeping my fingers crossed.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.136
Just paying attention to her.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.071
I got her right in front of me,
right in my sights,

10:40.073 --> 10:42.240
I see everything she's doing.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.476
I really want her to just get
the feeling of the roads,

10:44.478 --> 10:46.845
You know, how it's throwing
the truck around.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.414
Narrator: It's steph's first
trip on the winter roads.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.018
- All right, hang on.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.519
(on radio) this is gonna
get rough.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.687
- Copy that.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.722
Narrator: And the trail's
packed with new challenges

10:57.724 --> 10:58.456
Around every turn.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.393
Todd: (on radio) watch it.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.528
(truck rattles)

11:05.432 --> 11:06.798
- Oh.

11:09.136 --> 11:09.534
(truck smashes)

11:11.405 --> 11:13.204
Holy (bleep).

11:14.941 --> 11:16.374
That knocked me right out
of gear. Woo!

11:26.653 --> 11:27.385
- We're good, good to go.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.354
- (laughs)

11:29.356 --> 11:31.056
Yeah, you're doing good.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.490
I don't want to take no chances.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.059
We're going to chain the
(bleep) out of these tires.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.061
Steph: (on radio) copy that.

11:36.997 --> 11:37.662
Todd: (on radio)
we'll stop right here.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.098
This is a good wide spot.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.738
(doors slam)

11:49.342 --> 11:50.508
(chains clink)

11:50.510 --> 11:54.279
Narrator: Driver's put on
chains for added traction,

11:54.281 --> 11:57.882
An essential step for surviving
the ice roads.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.421
Todd: Stephanie
what are you doing?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.724
There ain't no way you beat me
putting chains on.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.560
Steph: Um, I'm looking at your
job so I can figure out mine.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.595
Ha. Um, I got all my chains
laid out.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.465
Just wanna make sure I'm put--

12:13.467 --> 12:16.735
Todd: What are you trying
to tell me here?

12:16.737 --> 12:19.237
Steph: I might not know how
to put chains on my tires.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.343
Todd: You're kidding me.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.879
And we're going onto
the ice road?

12:27.881 --> 12:30.315
Oh, lord.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.018
Wow, I wanna take you right now

12:34.020 --> 12:35.820
And dunk your head
in this frickin' snow bank.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.255
Steph: (laughs) don't.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.225
- Yeah this is, chains are,

12:40.227 --> 12:41.693
Yeah, you definitely need to
learn how to throw chains.

12:41.695 --> 12:42.660
I mean, and they gotta be
thrown right

12:42.662 --> 12:44.395
'cause if they're not on
nice and tight,

12:44.397 --> 12:47.132
They're not thrown right,
then your chains break apart

12:47.134 --> 12:48.032
Then you don't got any,

12:48.034 --> 12:49.734
And then you're really
in trouble.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.269
This is all the stuff
you should know

12:51.271 --> 12:53.872
Before you even attempt
to even drive the ice roads.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.443
Get it all leveled out;
your ice breakers are up.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.746
Just tuck it under the tire
just like that you got it.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.251
'kay, now get your bungees.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.485
Just make like a big star
all the way around.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.257
That bungee cord probably
has got more stretch

13:12.259 --> 13:13.625
Than you weigh.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.495
See and it doesn't help when
they're ice cold like it is too.

13:18.398 --> 13:22.534
There you go. Then we'll do
one right here maybe.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.504
There. Nice and tight.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.940
They look good.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.975
There's only one thing left
to do, hit the road.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.210
Steph: All right.
Todd: 'kay.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.813
Todd: She had no idea how
to throw chains.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.381
It was her first time ever.

13:36.383 --> 13:40.251
That uh, that's pretty scary.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.489
- Hammer down.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.425
- Ha, she's got high spirits,

13:47.427 --> 13:49.027
But I'm telling you right now,

13:49.029 --> 13:50.829
She's got a lot to prove today.

13:53.033 --> 13:53.932
Boy it's going to be an
exciting day.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.301
(on radio) okay, girl,
here we go!

13:56.303 --> 13:58.870
Narrator: With the tires
chained up

13:58.872 --> 14:01.239
And a new skill learned,

14:01.241 --> 14:03.474
The duo gets back on the road

14:03.476 --> 14:05.443
With over 300 miles still to go.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.749
While polar's convoy presses on,

14:13.687 --> 14:15.420
700 miles to the west

14:16.356 --> 14:18.056
In alberta...

14:18.058 --> 14:19.624
(wind gusts)

14:25.298 --> 14:26.564
(engine roars)

14:35.675 --> 14:37.175
- I'm leading,

14:37.177 --> 14:40.879
But do you know what the hell's
going on down this road?

14:40.881 --> 14:44.482
- I don't know (bleep) about
this, this alberta stuff.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.718
- It's all new,
it's all alberta,

14:46.720 --> 14:47.552
Haven't been here before.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.090
Narrator: Darrell and lisa
are convoying

14:52.092 --> 14:54.659
On their most ambitious
journey yet.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.194
Into a new province,

14:56.196 --> 14:58.429
And onto a trial nicknamed
the death road.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.402
- We ended up branching out our
company and going to alberta.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.973
Long ride up here
from winnipeg.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.410
Narrator: The contract would
be the young companies richest
to date,

15:12.412 --> 15:17.282
But the trail to distant
fort chipewyan is a marathon

15:17.284 --> 15:20.251
And even with 900 miles behind
them,

15:20.253 --> 15:23.288
They've still got 300 yet to go.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.191
(radio static)

15:30.764 --> 15:32.797
There's nobody else out here.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.534
(wind gusts)

15:38.605 --> 15:40.204
(radio static)

15:43.443 --> 15:45.576
I don't like being
this far out.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.419
I can see how they call
this the death road.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.487
If anything ever went wrong
out here

15:56.489 --> 16:00.425
You'd die before anybody
else came along.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.029
(truck engine hums)

16:05.966 --> 16:07.598
Darrell: Things could get
out of hand real quick

16:07.600 --> 16:09.534
In a situation like this.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.669
You don't know what's ahead
of ya?

16:11.671 --> 16:14.305
(on radio) don't know what's
around the next corner.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.707
- Take it as it comes.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.342
I think that's why we're
so good on these roads

16:17.344 --> 16:20.545
Cause we're good at adapting
ourselves to the situation.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.446
- Yeah, 10-4.

16:24.384 --> 16:28.319
- If anybody can get this job
done it's me and darrell.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.255
Now we just have to prove that.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.961
(truck engine roars)

16:37.897 --> 16:40.098
- We either succeed or...

16:40.100 --> 16:42.433
Failure's not an option
so you never know...

16:42.435 --> 16:43.434
Lisa: (on radio)
I got a problem.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.502
I just had a check engine light
come on.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.571
(beeping)

16:48.274 --> 16:49.907
- Oh (bleep).

16:51.277 --> 16:53.911
(beeping)
lisa: What a disaster.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.453
Narrator: In alberta,
hundreds of miles from home...

17:03.490 --> 17:04.489
Lisa: I just had a check
engine light come on.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.759
Narrator: ...Lisa kelly
and darrell ward

17:07.761 --> 17:10.461
Could be facing a worst
case scenario.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.064
- Oh (bleep).

17:14.367 --> 17:16.000
(beeping)

17:16.936 --> 17:18.336
Lisa: I need to pull over here
and uh, check it out.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.139
Darrell: (on radio) all right.
10-4.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.242
What a disaster.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.612
(rumbles to a halt,
airbrakes hiss)

17:30.417 --> 17:34.285
Darrell: Fine time to have
a problem.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.754
Lisa: Um, so my check engine
light come on

17:36.756 --> 17:39.457
And I wanna make sure
everything's okay.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.858
Darrell: Yeah.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.331
Let's see what we have here.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.470
Well, we do have oil
in the water,

17:52.472 --> 17:54.305
Lots of it.

17:54.307 --> 17:58.643
Narrator: Oil from the engine is
leaking into the coolant system.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.878
- There's a lot of oil in there.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.880
You got an internal leak.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.415
Narrator: If too much oil
continues to bleed,

18:04.417 --> 18:06.417
The engine could seize up.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.387
- When you start the engine
you're pushing oil

18:09.389 --> 18:11.456
Into the water system

18:11.458 --> 18:13.424
Which is what we don't want.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.426
Narrator: With the leak
it's a guessing game

18:15.428 --> 18:19.931
To how long until lisa's
truck is un-drivable.

18:19.933 --> 18:20.832
Darrell: We're gonna run it,

18:20.834 --> 18:21.866
We're gonna keep an eye
on the oil

18:21.868 --> 18:24.302
And make sure it stays full
of oil.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.638
Narrator: Hundreds of miles from
any mechanic or service station,

18:27.640 --> 18:31.242
They've got no choice
but to press forward.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.211
Darrell: There ain't much else
we can do about it.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.545
Put her into the wind.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.448
(truck engine hums)

18:37.450 --> 18:40.051
Narrator: Darrell and lisa
hit the long road,

18:40.053 --> 18:42.520
Big money on the line
and fingers crossed.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.789
Lisa: Run with it, watch it,

18:44.791 --> 18:46.424
Make sure it doesn't get low
on fluids.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.527
I have no idea
if we'll make it.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.896
Guess we'll find out.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.200
Narrator: While the renegades
press their luck,

18:58.438 --> 19:00.571
700 miles to the east...

19:03.877 --> 19:04.775
(truck rattles)

19:04.777 --> 19:07.445
- Oh, (bleep).
(laughs) oh my god.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.651
Narrator: ...Polar's convoy of
steph custance and todd dewey

19:13.653 --> 19:14.619
Is in the thick of it,

19:14.621 --> 19:16.454
And the rookie is getting
a crash course

19:16.456 --> 19:19.457
On the winter roads.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.760
Steph: I feel like a demolition
derby driver

19:22.762 --> 19:24.996
Or something out here.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.431
- Welcome to the ice roads,
baby.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.233
(on radio) yeah,
these roads are unforgiving.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.069
(laughing) yep.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.539
My frickin' door's opened up.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.508
Narrator: Since breaking onto
the ice roads four years ago,

19:37.510 --> 19:39.911
No job's been too tough...

19:39.913 --> 19:42.880
- Got the door shut now,
ha, ha, ha.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.882
Biggest load in history
to cross this ice right here

19:44.884 --> 19:45.650
I'm hauling right now.

19:45.652 --> 19:49.287
Narrator: Or too big for todd.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.088
- That's what I'm talking about.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.857
Narrator: And he's earned
the reputation

19:52.859 --> 19:55.293
As polar's most reliable driver.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.361
Todd: Woo!
Lisa: Holy cow.

19:57.363 --> 20:01.098
Narrator: So there's no better
teacher on the winter roads.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.767
Todd: Steph's doing a great job
so far.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.069
She's keeping a pretty good
pace.

20:06.272 --> 20:09.006
I don't want to push her too
hard right off the get go.

20:10.777 --> 20:11.409
(truck rattles)

20:14.347 --> 20:15.379
- Oh my god.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.249
I actually have to raise
my steering wheel

20:18.251 --> 20:19.684
Because, actually I might
need to keep it down

20:19.686 --> 20:20.451
So it keeps me down.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.254
Todd: (on radio) ha, ha, yep.

20:24.157 --> 20:26.057
(truck engine roars)

20:26.059 --> 20:27.925
- The main thing you want to
look out for on these ice roads

20:27.927 --> 20:30.061
Is big bumps in the center
of the road

20:30.063 --> 20:31.262
Because if it's a great big rock

20:31.264 --> 20:34.031
That rock gets your oil can
you know what'll happen.

20:34.033 --> 20:37.568
- Yeah, I'll (bleep) piss oil
everywhere and ruin my engine.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.470
Todd: (on radio) yeah, you'll
rip your oil can wide open

20:39.472 --> 20:41.305
And lose all your oil.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.641
- All right, sounds good.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.475
I'll uh, yeah,
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.285
- Yeah, you betcha.
Yeah, what's going on, bud?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.422
- Uh, headed up uh, winter road
there to shamattawa.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.606
Todd: Oh. Sweet lord,
thanks for the information

21:15.608 --> 21:17.041
We appreciate it.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.277
That's good to know.
Thanks, buddy.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.115
Todd: (on radio) yep, you too.

21:27.754 --> 21:31.022
Uh, hey... Stephanie,
you got your ears open?

21:31.024 --> 21:34.225
- Uh, yeah, now I got my nerves
going too.

21:34.227 --> 21:38.796
Todd: Yeah, did you just hear
that gentleman there that
radioed us?

21:38.798 --> 21:39.363
- Yeah, I uh...

21:41.868 --> 21:44.135
I mean, what are we supposed
to do about that?

21:44.137 --> 21:47.271
- Ha, welcome to ice road
trucking.

21:47.273 --> 21:50.641
That's what happens. Thank god.
It happens all the time so.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.344
He said the road was still
open and uh,

21:53.346 --> 21:55.613
All I can say is keep
your fingers crossed, kid.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.484
Well, we're almost there now
so there ain't no turning back.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.587
Hopefully we can get across.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.323
- Holy (bleep).

22:10.063 --> 22:12.129
- I'll walk her through it

22:12.131 --> 22:14.632
And get her across it
and we'll get back to trucking.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.536
(airbrakes hiss)

22:24.677 --> 22:27.712
- I'm (bleep) my pants
right now.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.480
- Go check out the ice.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.049
- All right.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.052
- I know she's nervous.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.991
'kay, well, this is it.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.226
(wind gusts)

22:42.228 --> 22:44.862
Out there, somebody's obviously
fell through right there

22:44.864 --> 22:46.697
And that's why that's
blocked off.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.568
Crazy to think that, isn't it?

22:50.570 --> 22:53.404
- Yeah, I'm, I'm kind
of (bleep) my pants here.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.573
- Just stay away
from that whole area. Okay?

22:55.575 --> 22:57.141
- Yeah.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.909
Say I did go through,
how fast am I going through?

22:58.911 --> 23:01.045
- You're gonna go through
probably pretty quick.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.781
- Holy (bleep).

23:03.783 --> 23:06.050
- I know you have a kid at home
and I got kids at home,

23:06.052 --> 23:08.419
But believe me I think about it
every time I get onto the ice.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.722
This is part of the job.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.758
This is, this is ice road
trucking.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.628
You ready?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.630
- I'm nervous but I'm ready.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.301
Narrator: With a crossing
that's already seen

23:24.303 --> 23:26.303
One truck break through,

23:26.305 --> 23:30.040
Steph prepares for her first
time on the ice.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.380
- Okay steph, I know
you're nervous

35:54.253 --> 35:56.686
Get that truck to the shop
and get it repaired.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.023
You do have oil in the water.

36:00.926 --> 36:01.858
Lots of it.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.527
Narrator: Midway through
the long journey

36:03.529 --> 36:07.230
Lisa's engine sprung a leak.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.132
Darrell: Which is what
we don't want.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.535
Narrator: Despite bleeding oil

36:11.537 --> 36:14.371
For 6 hours and 200 miles

36:14.373 --> 36:16.773
The engine hasn't seized up yet.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.310
- My engine's screwed.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.413
Hopefully, we're getting close.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.916
- Copy that.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.019
Narrator: Now it's a race
against the clock

36:29.021 --> 36:31.621
To see if lisa's truck can make
it through the final stretch

36:31.623 --> 36:34.591
Before the engine gives out.

36:34.593 --> 36:38.828
Lisa: Just question whether
we'll make it or not.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.263
(truck rattles)

36:42.801 --> 36:44.534
- This sucks.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.970
You know if this truck doesn't
make it out of here

36:46.972 --> 36:51.408
You know this business
could sink, could go down.

36:58.116 --> 36:59.549
Narrator: In the farthest
reaches of alberta...

37:03.855 --> 37:05.722
Lisa: Hope that I can
just make it.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.559
Narrator: The clock's ticking
on two renegade business owners.

37:12.397 --> 37:16.032
Darrell: Just a little father.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.401
Narrator: Pushing over
1000 miles

37:18.403 --> 37:22.973
The teams trying to pull off the
longest haul in company history

37:22.975 --> 37:24.507
If lisa's engine can hold on.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.446
- Hopefully we're getting close.

37:32.150 --> 37:32.649
(truck rattles)

37:35.621 --> 37:38.188
(truck engine hums)

37:44.596 --> 37:47.731
- I see a village off
to my right here.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.200
- You don't think that's
fort chip, do ya?

37:50.202 --> 37:52.135
- Yeah, off to my right.

37:52.137 --> 37:53.570
Narrator: Finally...

37:54.506 --> 37:57.574
The team reaches the outskirts
of fort chipewyan.

37:57.576 --> 38:00.443
- I cannot believe
that I made it.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.949
Narrator: Lisa limps into
the drop off point.

38:07.319 --> 38:10.420
- We survived the roads,
we got our loads delivered.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.124
Now that's how we do it.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.492
(on radio) you did good.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.227
Lisa: It was a long way.

38:17.229 --> 38:19.529
It was a tough trip
but we did it.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.999
Narrator: The truck can be
repaired in town for the ride
back.

38:23.001 --> 38:26.036
Lisa and darrell have
successfully expanded

38:26.038 --> 38:27.971
The winter roads map.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.541
Darrell: It's good, lisa, we
made our first load to alberta.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.444
It was huge progress for us

38:34.446 --> 38:36.946
As a company expanding
to a new province.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.316
We locked in the contract.

38:39.318 --> 38:42.085
This company's surviving,
this company's expanding.

38:43.255 --> 38:44.421
- Do you have somebody lined up?

38:44.423 --> 38:46.723
- I think so.
- All right, let's go get it.

38:48.794 --> 38:51.161
Narrator: While one convoy's
completed their mission,

38:51.430 --> 38:54.731
800 miles to the southeast...

39:01.740 --> 39:05.075
...The competitions still got
a convoy on the road.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.779
- Shamattawa's coming up
close here

39:09.781 --> 39:14.284
So we're gonna get in there,
find our trailers.

39:14.286 --> 39:16.186
Narrator: Under todd dewey's
mentorship.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.988
Rookie steph custance,
is only 50 miles

39:18.990 --> 39:21.391
From completing the road
into shamattawa

39:21.393 --> 39:25.061
On her first ice road's journey.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.263
- Hey todd, do you got a copy?

39:27.265 --> 39:29.199
- Yeah, steph, go ahead.
What's up?

39:29.201 --> 39:30.600
Steph: I'm just wondering uh,
are we going all the way?

39:30.602 --> 39:33.570
Are we gonna stop
or what's the plan here?

39:33.572 --> 39:34.938
- You know, we're this close,

39:34.940 --> 39:36.773
I think we should just get into
shamattawa

39:36.775 --> 39:39.709
Go find our trailers. You know,
our, our haul and uh,

39:39.711 --> 39:42.078
Gonna bunker down right next
to them for the night

39:42.080 --> 39:43.580
And that way we're just ready
to go for the first thing
in the morning.

39:43.582 --> 39:44.681
What do you think?

39:47.285 --> 39:48.351
- Sounds good to me, buddy.

39:48.353 --> 39:50.453
We pushed this far might
as well keep trucking.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.622
- Good attitude.
I like the attitude.

39:57.362 --> 39:59.295
She does a good job.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.364
She, she's got a lot of
enthusiasm and I like that.

40:01.366 --> 40:07.103
But we haven't got into
the hard stuff yet.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.177
- Hey todd?
Todd: (on radio) yeah,
go ahead, steph.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.445
- I'm coming up onto
the ice crossing here.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.722
So I got my first ice crossing
during the day

40:25.724 --> 40:30.226
And looks like I'm about to get
my first ice crossing at night.

40:30.228 --> 40:32.195
I'm feeling like the most
worked in first timer ever.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.301
(chains clink)

40:38.303 --> 40:40.370
Coming up to the ice crossing.

40:40.372 --> 40:46.142
♪♪♪

40:46.144 --> 40:47.811
- Now uh,

40:49.481 --> 40:51.815
That doesn't look right.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.386
Hey todd, do you got a copy
back there?

40:56.388 --> 40:58.321
- Yeah, steph, I'm right here.

40:58.323 --> 41:00.490
- I hate to be the bearer
of bad news but...

41:00.492 --> 41:05.028
I'm coming up to the shamattawa
night ice crossing right now.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.464
I'm seeing some barricades
up here, man.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.567
- What?

41:10.569 --> 41:12.035
Steph: Yeah, I don't know.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.470
I'm seeing uh, I'm seeing some
barricades.

41:13.472 --> 41:16.739
It doesn't really look like
I can get on to the ice.

41:16.741 --> 41:18.575
Todd: (on radio) oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

41:18.577 --> 41:22.512
Well, if there's barricades up
that only means one thing...

41:24.583 --> 41:27.750
That the ice crossing into
shamattawa is closed.

41:27.752 --> 41:30.053
That we are not getting
across the ice.

41:30.055 --> 41:30.620
- Oh, no way.

41:32.824 --> 41:36.192
Narrator: The convoy is stuck
dead in their tracks.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.763
Todd: They have barricaded it
as unsafe.

41:40.765 --> 41:43.032
We ain't makin' any money.

41:44.202 --> 41:47.303
Narrator: After 500
bone-crushing miles,

41:47.305 --> 41:50.673
Steph's first trip and the
convoy's critical mission

41:50.675 --> 41:52.709
Could be a complete bust.

41:57.215 --> 41:57.881
Narrator: Next time...

41:57.883 --> 41:59.582
Todd: (on radio) hold on.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.217
Narrator: On "ice road
truckers"...

42:01.219 --> 42:02.585
(chains clink)
todd: Whoa!

42:02.587 --> 42:06.022
Narrator: ...The warm weather
tears the roads...

42:06.024 --> 42:08.958
Alex: Saint theresa point
closed. (bleep).

42:08.960 --> 42:11.995
Narrator: ...And the crossings
apart...

42:11.997 --> 42:14.230
Darrell: Look at the ice
cracking right there.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.999
What the (bleep).

42:16.001 --> 42:18.401
Narrator: ...And has the drivers
holding on...

42:18.403 --> 42:19.869
(truck honks)
art: Whoa!

42:19.871 --> 42:22.272
(bleep) there's a (bleep) truck.

42:22.274 --> 42:24.173
Narrator: ...For dear life.

42:24.175 --> 42:25.241
Art: Hang on.
(truck honks)
