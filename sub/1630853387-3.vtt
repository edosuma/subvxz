WEBVTT

01:27.671 --> 01:29.047
Oi!

01:45.063 --> 01:46.982
Help me! Come on! Get the net!

01:48.567 --> 01:51.945
Joshua! Joshua! Joshua!

01:52.029 --> 01:54.781
Joshua! Quick! Swim! Come on!

02:05.792 --> 02:06.793
It's okay.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.717
Are you awake?

02:57.719 --> 02:59.346
It don't look like you slept much.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.977
One of those nights
that just goes on and on and on.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.319
Those children have nothing
to entertain themselves with.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.779
I shouldn't have gone in.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.573
You were showing them fossils.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.366
I didn't think they'd get so--

03:19.449 --> 03:21.994
One of their classmates has died.
Of course they're upset.

03:22.077 --> 03:25.038
It was more than just upset.
They were terrified.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.791
And it was my fault.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.470
Morning.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.682
Any better?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.478
Jo, say something.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.398
It's all right, Jo.
You'll speak when you're ready.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.068
The serpent took her voice.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.445
John Ransome.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.536
She's been silent all weekend.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.997
Perhaps the person
we should be talking to is Cora.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.957
She could tell us what actually happened.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.631
Any sign of Luke?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.466
Not yet.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.677
Why don't you go
and get us some milk from Cracknell?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.012
Do you remember the way?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.222
Of course I do.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.183
Stay away from the water.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.415
He's here!

04:53.168 --> 04:56.046
-Cora, how are you?
-Luke, it's so good to see you.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.548
I want you to see the school.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.258
-Mind if we go straight there?
-Not at all.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.764
Thank you for coming so quickly!

05:05.848 --> 05:07.933
Of course. As soon as I got your letter.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.519
I've hardly slept since it happened.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.730
That doesn't sound good.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.315
So what exactly happened?

05:29.705 --> 05:32.583
If you're here to buy milk,
you'll have to do it yourself.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.130
Come over here.

05:49.224 --> 05:53.478
Don't be scared, now.
You'll make her nervous if you are.

05:55.814 --> 05:56.815
See?

06:03.238 --> 06:05.866
Hello. Hello there.

06:08.994 --> 06:12.831
It was like a contagion.
As if they were all possessed by a devil.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.753
Except you don't believe
in the supernatural, Cora.

06:19.338 --> 06:23.759
Something happened.
It wasn't just children playing.

06:24.343 --> 06:27.638
All right, but perhaps
there's a rational explanation, eh?

06:28.639 --> 06:29.640
Such as?

06:29.723 --> 06:32.601
We now think
the girls in the Salem witch trials

06:32.684 --> 06:36.230
ate a poison that altered
the chemistry of their brains.

06:37.314 --> 06:42.653
Claviceps purpurea. It's a mold.
It grows on rye and other cereals.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.240
Could this poison lead to
hallucinations and convulsions?

06:46.323 --> 06:49.993
Yes, absolutely. Although,
it isn't at all common in England.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.497
There's nothing common
about what happened here.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.339
You can see for yourself.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.271
It looks as if they were attacked.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.066
I thought if I came back…

07:23.318 --> 07:24.319
Shall we?

07:36.248 --> 07:38.083
-Mrs. Seaborne.
-I'm collecting my things.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.710
I need to clear up
before the children arrive.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.211
Don't worry. We're just leaving.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.256
-And you are?
-Luke Garrett.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.424
He's a doctor.

07:45.507 --> 07:50.012
Yes. I'm interested in
what happened to the children.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.599
Have they had any fevers
or swollen faces? Vomiting?

07:53.682 --> 07:55.350
No. Why would they?

07:55.976 --> 07:59.479
-I'm simply trying to exp--
-All I can tell you is my class was fine

07:59.563 --> 08:03.358
until you came here
with your heretical ideas.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.446
Come on.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.125
Jo.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.380
I don't know what happened on Friday.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.720
But I do know that I can't help
unless you talk to me.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.227
I won't be angry.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.999
Come along, now.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.961
Yes, yes. I understand.
Well, if that's what you have to do…

09:04.044 --> 09:05.045
Come on.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.470
You'll be all right.

09:14.513 --> 09:15.597
I'll see you later.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.563
Did they tell you what happened?

09:24.147 --> 09:27.234
Of course. Jo's been very upset.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.319
I tried to tell you.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.322
Children need certainty. Not new ideas.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.283
They'll be all right.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.702
Even their parents are scared.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.913
They think
the children can sense a presence.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.375
A presence?
Well, I hope you set them straight.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.754
Matthew, it doesn't help to legitimize
wild stories made up in a public house.

09:47.838 --> 09:48.964
So you haven't heard?

09:50.382 --> 09:54.553
The fishermen were attacked in their boats
this morning. Their nets, shredded.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.599
Naomi! Go home! You can't come in today.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.435
-Matthew.
-I won't have her in. She's trouble.

10:04.188 --> 10:07.024
Naomi. Naomi, wait.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.198
She needs to be here.
She's just lost her sister.

10:16.074 --> 10:19.036
It's my school. I'm sorry.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.270
I've been so stupid.

10:46.522 --> 10:47.648
No.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.901
I thought it would calm them down.

10:50.984 --> 10:55.155
So they could see that their serpent
might have a rational explanation.

10:55.239 --> 10:57.282
You really believe
there's a creature out there?

11:00.953 --> 11:02.496
Yes, I think so.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.294
Can I ask you a personal question?

11:11.380 --> 11:13.173
Does it appear in your dreams?

11:20.848 --> 11:22.224
Thought so.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.934
You think it's all in my mind?

11:24.977 --> 11:26.270
I think you're grieving.

11:29.231 --> 11:33.026
These are the theories
of pioneers such as Darwin and Lyell.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.028
And the creature's been seen
by local people

11:35.112 --> 11:37.155
-for over 200 years.
-Good.

11:37.823 --> 11:38.824
Yes.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.325
There it is.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.119
-What?
-Your passion.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.371
So you do believe me?

11:44.454 --> 11:45.956
It doesn't matter what I think.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.085
I do know you won't find the truth
without a struggle.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.881
You need to have faith in yourself
and get back to work.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.834
Will.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.338
How are you? How's Jo?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.173
I hope I'm not disturbing.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.091
No, not at all. Will you come in?

12:44.014 --> 12:46.767
-A boat? What kind of boat?
-Well, how far is it?

12:47.351 --> 12:49.853
Our friend, Luke Garrett, is visiting
from London. Come and meet him.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.439
No, no, I-- I'm due back for dinner.

12:52.523 --> 12:55.025
I just
wanted to see if you were all right.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.654
The children told me
what happened at the school.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.865
Thank you. I'm fine. But how's Jo?

13:02.783 --> 13:05.827
-She's--
-Cora? We need you.

13:06.787 --> 13:12.167
I'm disturbing you.
Perhaps we can talk tomorrow?

13:12.751 --> 13:14.378
Yes. Goodbye.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.506
Wait.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.260
Who was that?

13:22.261 --> 13:23.428
Will Ransome.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.640
That's the bullnecked old vicar?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.396
Of course
you want to understand what happened.

13:32.479 --> 13:36.233
-It's not that I'm trying to suggest--
-No, it was my mistake. I scared them.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.194
You didn't start all this.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.072
I was up all night thinking I did.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.535
Sometimes
the middle of the night lies to us.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.496
Yes.

13:54.168 --> 13:58.088
Stella thought you might have
an idea of how we can help Jo.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.633
It's so odd, Cora.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.887
She can't speak.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.471
What?

14:06.555 --> 14:07.681
She's scared.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.938
My friend Luke is a doctor.
He could come and talk to Jo.

14:20.944 --> 14:24.448
Thank you. Yes. That could really help.

14:26.992 --> 14:31.496
Well, I suppose
you better get back to your guest.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.874
Yes.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.335
You came without a coat?

14:49.598 --> 14:50.599
Thank you.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.063
Goodbye.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.147
Bye.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.177
Drink?

15:30.806 --> 15:35.102
Martha tells me this bottle is
being saved for your birthday on Saturday.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.020
Why didn't you tell me?

15:37.104 --> 15:40.023
-Who likes birthdays?
-Everyone likes birthdays, parties…

15:42.317 --> 15:43.652
I've never had a party.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.487
I don't believe you.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.657
Michael had parties.

15:49.867 --> 15:54.830
People drinking, showing off.
And of course he showed me off too.

15:54.913 --> 15:58.208
Well, then it's about time you had one.

15:58.792 --> 16:02.254
This Saturday, I'm throwing you
a party for your birthday.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.519
Will's really anxious about Jo.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.273
I said you'd see her.
I hope you don't mind.

16:21.857 --> 16:25.360
Of course not. I could try hypnosis.

16:25.444 --> 16:28.906
You want to mesmerize Jo?
Isn't that dangerous?

16:28.989 --> 16:32.034
No. I've been following
the work of this Austrian doctor.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.327
He takes a medical approach.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.954
He simply allows the patient
to access their unconscious.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.707
Reveal their innermost fears,
secret passions and such.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.751
Is it safe?

16:40.834 --> 16:44.087
Absolutely. I could show you.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.676
You're sure
you want to root around inside my head?

16:52.554 --> 16:53.680
It was only a thought.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.101
Well, what do I need to do?

16:58.602 --> 17:03.941
Nothing. Really.
Just lay back where you are.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.164
Now…

17:20.499 --> 17:22.209
I might not be able to do it.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.586
Well, that's the beauty of hypnosis.
You don't have to try.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.839
Just follow what I say.

17:28.674 --> 17:29.675
I trust you.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.429
Deep, steady breaths.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.267
Let yourself relax.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.688
Your limbs are heavy.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.176
Relax.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.888
Let go of your fears.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.809
Surrender to your desires.

18:35.574 --> 18:38.785
When I said
get back to work, I didn't mean for me.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.829
How far is it?

18:45.626 --> 18:48.170
There'll be things here that haven't
seen the light of day in thousands,

18:48.253 --> 18:50.339
maybe millions of years.

18:53.175 --> 18:57.304
You know, if it hasn't got blood pumping
around it, my interest wavers slightly.

18:59.890 --> 19:01.767
I used to have fossils
sent to me in the post.

19:02.935 --> 19:05.729
Put them in a display case
with a pretty label.

19:07.898 --> 19:10.943
You certainly look different
from the woman I met in that grand house.

19:27.543 --> 19:28.669
Luke!

19:29.169 --> 19:30.295
What is it?

19:34.508 --> 19:36.844
It looks like the vertebra
Anning found in Dorset.

20:30.647 --> 20:31.899
What happened here?

20:31.982 --> 20:33.400
It shredded the nets.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.444
-Nearly knocked the men off the boats.
-What did?

20:35.527 --> 20:37.905
-Could have killed 'em all.
-Something in the water?

20:37.988 --> 20:39.740
Did you see it? What did it look like?

20:39.823 --> 20:42.367
Maybe you should tell us?
You seem to know all about it.

20:42.451 --> 20:43.577
What? No, I--

20:43.660 --> 20:46.705
My little girl's been having nightmares
since you came into her classroom.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.415
Mrs. Seaborne was only tryna help.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.666
I'm sorry if I scared them.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.419
-Scared 'em? What did you do to 'em?
-We should go.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.715
We don't know
why you're here, and we don't care.

20:56.798 --> 21:03.305
But if you're doing something,
whatever it is, please, stop it.

21:24.618 --> 21:25.619
Dad?

22:06.869 --> 22:09.371
-Have you seen my dad?
-Yeah, he just left.

22:22.176 --> 22:23.468
Actually, I'll have a beer.

22:25.679 --> 22:26.930
All right.

22:40.569 --> 22:43.447
-Naomi.
-Samuel.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.086
Have you heard about the nets?

23:00.214 --> 23:01.215
Yeah.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.473
Come on. Drink up. Drink up.

23:11.183 --> 23:12.226
I'll get us another.

23:25.531 --> 23:28.242
It's all right. I'm here.

23:36.625 --> 23:37.626
-You're hurting me.
-Come on.

23:38.961 --> 23:40.003
You're hurting me.

23:45.759 --> 23:48.178
-Come on.
-No.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.724
Stop. It's sinful.

23:53.225 --> 23:55.686
I thought you were a slut,
just like your sister.

24:06.363 --> 24:09.157
Forgive me, Father. Forgive me.

24:45.694 --> 24:48.447
It's the serpent. Doing the devil's work.

24:49.198 --> 24:50.616
Pray for our souls, Father.

24:51.325 --> 24:52.826
We must do more than pray.

25:03.170 --> 25:06.632
Cora. I'm so glad you came.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.176
-Hello, Martha.
-Hello.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.178
Stella, this is Luke Garrett.

25:11.762 --> 25:12.930
Luke, Stella Ransome.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.307
Dr. Garrett, how wonderful to meet you.

25:16.433 --> 25:17.476
Come on in.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.853
Please, forgive the mess.

25:20.354 --> 25:22.940
I'm struggling
to keep up with the housework.

25:26.777 --> 25:28.362
Is Will in his study?

25:29.071 --> 25:33.116
Visiting a parishioner, I'm afraid.
He'll be sorry to have missed you.

25:40.082 --> 25:41.083
Hello.

25:44.962 --> 25:47.381
Well, you should all come
to Cora's on Saturday.

25:47.464 --> 25:49.675
It's her birthday.
I'm going to be throwing her a party.

25:49.758 --> 25:50.759
We'd love to.

25:52.469 --> 25:53.846
Could you make us some tea?

26:02.437 --> 26:03.522
How is she?

26:04.815 --> 26:05.858
Silent.

26:08.026 --> 26:09.069
It's very unnerving.

26:10.112 --> 26:12.489
Poor girl. She's scared herself.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.827
Please, sit down.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.587
What's your opinion, Dr. Garrett?

26:29.047 --> 26:30.632
Have you heard of the unconscious?

26:30.716 --> 26:31.758
No.

26:32.968 --> 26:38.640
It's our inner thoughts and fears.

26:38.724 --> 26:44.146
We can't control them, but they
can influence us and our behavior.

26:46.273 --> 26:49.443
It sounds alarming. It's just
the way the brain works, I assure you.

26:50.194 --> 26:54.948
What I'd like to do
is put Jo into a state of relaxation,

26:55.032 --> 26:59.286
so she can retrieve those inner thoughts
and tell us what's troubling her.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.538
It's called hypnosis.

27:06.335 --> 27:07.336
Thank you.

27:12.591 --> 27:16.845
Dr. Garrett is offering to try a new
practice to help with how you're feeling.

27:18.222 --> 27:19.932
It's called hypnosis.

27:20.599 --> 27:21.683
Exactly.

27:27.147 --> 27:32.069
Excellent. Well, we will need to organize
the room and draw the curtains.

27:35.197 --> 27:38.075
Don't you think we should wait for Will?
If Jo was my daughter--

27:38.158 --> 27:39.868
You want to wait for a man's permission?

27:45.874 --> 27:48.335
I need to get back for Frankie.
I'll slip off.

27:57.261 --> 27:59.513
Sorry, I can't seem to shake off
the flu.

28:19.992 --> 28:23.787
Please, God. Protect us all.

28:25.122 --> 28:27.416
Protect us all. Keep us safe.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.126
Matthew.

28:31.879 --> 28:33.213
I'm sorry.

28:35.007 --> 28:36.341
I didn't know you were--

28:37.217 --> 28:38.218
It's your church.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.054
Matthew.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.517
-You're upset.
-I'm not upset.

28:45.601 --> 28:46.810
Sit with me.

29:06.955 --> 29:10.542
A man's conversations with God
are no one's business but his own.

29:10.626 --> 29:13.795
But we should confide
in each other. It can help.

29:13.879 --> 29:15.672
-You're so good at this.
-At what?

29:15.756 --> 29:18.800
This. The easy way you talk,

29:18.884 --> 29:21.887
making people feel like
what they say is important,

29:22.679 --> 29:24.473
that you'll take it seriously.

29:25.641 --> 29:28.018
-I just--
-I know what you think when I talk.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.272
You see someone
who's taken in by tall tales.

29:32.898 --> 29:36.693
-No. No, that's not what I think.
-You don't understand.

29:39.071 --> 29:41.156
You're not out on the water
risking your life.

29:42.324 --> 29:44.785
Your children aren't crying in their beds

29:44.868 --> 29:47.621
-because they can feel something coming.
-My children--

30:01.218 --> 30:03.178
Gracie's death was a tragedy.

30:05.931 --> 30:08.559
It was deeply unsettling for everyone,
but I'm not sure it's helpful

30:08.642 --> 30:11.103
-to keep suggesting--
-Go on. Explain it away to me again.

30:11.186 --> 30:14.231
Explain the scratches
on Gracie Banks's body.

30:14.314 --> 30:17.359
Explain the attack on the boats.
Your daughter struck dumb!

30:19.152 --> 30:21.363
I can see it in your face
that you feel it too.

30:26.285 --> 30:30.956
You're supposed to show
people how to stay in God's protection.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.710
You're supposed to keep people safe.

31:22.132 --> 31:28.055
"Therefore we will not fear,
though the waters roar, and we troubled."

32:05.801 --> 32:09.763
…always relaxed.
Aware of my voice.

32:10.264 --> 32:13.433
Your limbs are heavy.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.772
Jo, listen to my voice.

32:20.607 --> 32:24.111
Come towards me a little.
Let me know that you can hear my voice.

32:26.697 --> 32:30.492
Jo. Can you tell me how--

32:31.493 --> 32:32.703
The serpent.

32:36.415 --> 32:39.042
-I'm scared.
-You are safe, Jo.

32:40.586 --> 32:42.212
There is no need to be frightened.

32:43.630 --> 32:46.592
But what happened
in the classroom upset you, didn't it?

32:46.675 --> 32:47.885
I should've stopped it.

32:49.636 --> 32:52.222
Do you understand
that you did nothing wrong?

32:55.309 --> 32:56.518
We did the spell.

32:58.228 --> 32:59.479
We brought it here.

33:01.315 --> 33:02.649
Brought what here?

33:03.275 --> 33:06.028
It's all right. Take your time.

33:08.739 --> 33:10.449
It was supposed to be a secret.

33:10.532 --> 33:12.826
What was a secret, Jo?

33:14.536 --> 33:15.537
The spell.

33:17.039 --> 33:18.081
The spell we made.

33:18.832 --> 33:20.167
Luke.

33:20.250 --> 33:25.756
Jo, listen to my voice.
There's no need to be frightened.

33:26.882 --> 33:29.510
It's too late. Naomi let it in.

33:30.344 --> 33:31.345
I let it in.

33:32.596 --> 33:33.597
It's…

33:34.097 --> 33:35.891
-It's in us.
-Jo.

33:36.517 --> 33:37.518
Jo.

33:40.395 --> 33:42.022
Stop it.

33:43.148 --> 33:44.149
Jo.

33:46.944 --> 33:49.154
-What is this?
-Will. This is my friend,

33:49.238 --> 33:51.490
-Dr. Luke Garrett.
-Reverend Ransome--

33:52.741 --> 33:54.117
What are you doing to my daughter?

33:54.201 --> 33:56.286
You misunderstand. I'm helping her.

33:56.370 --> 33:59.289
-Your wife gave consent for me--
-Will, this is a friend.

33:59.373 --> 34:02.709
-A friend of Cora's. Let him go.
-This is my house. How dare you!

34:02.793 --> 34:05.546
You've got this wrong. Let him go. Now.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.178
I promise you, it's a very well-researched
bit of medical practice.

34:14.429 --> 34:15.472
You asked if I could help.

34:15.556 --> 34:16.556
Dad…

34:18.934 --> 34:20.226
I'm fine.

34:23.105 --> 34:24.147
We'll go.

34:24.231 --> 34:26.567
Cora, don't. It's just a misunderstanding.

34:27.067 --> 34:28.110
Thank you, Stella.

34:45.627 --> 34:46.628
I'm sorry.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.632
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.217
Well, I'm so sorry.

34:53.302 --> 34:55.512
I can't believe he reacted like that.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.307
It worked. She's talking again.

35:13.030 --> 35:15.365
Let the flames banish the darkness.

35:16.283 --> 35:17.951
Protect us from sin.

35:18.493 --> 35:19.828
Yes. Light the fire.

35:27.544 --> 35:28.962
I need wine.

35:29.630 --> 35:30.756
What happened?

35:31.507 --> 35:35.677
Will came home and wasn't pleased.
Let's put it that way.

35:37.221 --> 35:38.722
-He attacked me.
-What?

35:38.805 --> 35:40.849
No one attacked anyone. He came in,

35:40.933 --> 35:43.936
saw Luke leaning over Jo and overreacted.

35:44.436 --> 35:48.815
He must've been scared for her.
Did you explain it to him?

35:48.899 --> 35:51.443
-Did you apologize?
-Well, Stella and I were right there.

35:51.527 --> 35:55.280
I've seen people be mesmerized.
It looks odd. It is odd.

35:55.364 --> 35:57.699
It was hypnosis. And it worked.

35:59.493 --> 36:02.162
-But don't go. Stay up with us.
-I need to finish this.

36:02.246 --> 36:04.122
-Who are you writing to?
-Spencer.

36:06.124 --> 36:09.169
We're trying to help your patient, Nev,
and his neighbors, if you must know.

36:09.253 --> 36:11.380
Frankie, how are you?
How was your day?

36:11.463 --> 36:14.007
I like it here much more than London.

36:14.550 --> 36:16.176
I want to stay here forever.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.972
Well then, looks like
we're stuck here a bit longer, Martha.

36:21.849 --> 36:24.059
Come on, you. You smell like a goat.

36:24.142 --> 36:26.186
-I do not.
-You do.

36:26.270 --> 36:29.439
No good ever came
from leaving London, Cora.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.634
Are you cross with me too?

37:40.010 --> 37:41.512
Would you care if I was?

37:42.429 --> 37:43.680
You know I would.

37:48.352 --> 37:52.314
It's so frustrating.
I'm not trying to upset people.

37:54.149 --> 37:55.609
You should apologize to Will.

37:56.652 --> 37:59.154
I can't be expected to apologize
every time I do something

37:59.238 --> 38:01.365
without the express permission of a man.

38:01.448 --> 38:03.742
You only have to apologize
when you do something wrong.

38:05.577 --> 38:07.454
If only that were true.

38:12.042 --> 38:15.045
If you're sure you've done nothing wrong,
why are you so bothered?

38:24.847 --> 38:26.306
Just go to sleep.

39:53.769 --> 39:55.270
I didn't want to wake the house.

39:55.354 --> 39:56.730
There is a letter box.

39:56.813 --> 39:58.607
I wanted you to get it privately.

40:01.693 --> 40:03.946
Martha told me I needed to apologize.

40:04.613 --> 40:05.656
And did you?

40:06.406 --> 40:07.824
No.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.619
I can't apologize
when I don't think I did anything wrong.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.830
Well, I can't wait to read it.

40:13.914 --> 40:14.915
Are you mocking me?

40:14.998 --> 40:18.043
No, it's just entirely in keeping with
what I would expect from you.

40:21.755 --> 40:22.756
Cora, w…

40:28.846 --> 40:30.138
Cora!

40:30.222 --> 40:31.473
You asked me to help.

40:31.557 --> 40:34.101
-Not by experimenting on her.
-Stella gave her consent.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.228
What?
To bring it all back and terrify her?

40:36.311 --> 40:37.813
You know nothing about it.

40:37.896 --> 40:38.939
I know enough.

40:39.773 --> 40:43.277
You're furious because I didn't ask
your permission, defer to your judgment.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.736
Why would you
when you're with Dr. Garrett?

40:44.820 --> 40:46.822
You don't struggle with deference to him.

40:51.743 --> 40:54.288
I don't think you have a right
to be this angry with me.

40:57.708 --> 40:58.876
That's probably true.

41:01.253 --> 41:02.629
Then why are you?
