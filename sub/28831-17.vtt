WEBVTT

00:00.667 --> 00:02.711
Exes shouldn't date
their ex's friends.

00:02.711 --> 00:05.839
But you did ask me
for Lindsay's number
in there, my friend.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.257
Sumi:
<i>I can't go there.</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

00:08.550 --> 00:10.260
Davia, I love you.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.970
‐Gael: We can do this.
‐Oh, yeah.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.014
‐One!
‐(all yelling)

00:14.014 --> 00:15.265
‐(cracking)
‐(groaning)

00:15.265 --> 00:16.308
‐Callie: What's the verdict?
‐Broken wrist.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.685
We have some internships open,
and I wanna offer you one.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.187
That sounds amazing!

00:20.187 --> 00:21.939
You got arrested
at a BLM action.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.232
Justine:
They've offered a plea deal.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.775
Taking this plea would mean

00:24.775 --> 00:27.236
you can no longer protest
outside of public buildings.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.695
I will take my chances in trial.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.614
It sounds like you were
very persuasive.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.242
Where I was persuasive
was in convincing CC Hastings

00:33.242 --> 00:35.202
to double the money
they're offering the tenants.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.037
They're being taken advantage of

00:37.037 --> 00:39.081
by powerful companies
lining their pocket.

00:39.081 --> 00:42.251
I'm sorry I blindsided you,
but I tried to do right
by those people.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.585
What manifesto?

00:43.585 --> 00:45.587
"If women engineers
were qualified,

00:45.587 --> 00:48.257
"they wouldn't have to get
special favors from their boss

00:48.257 --> 00:50.884
"to bail them out of
an app failure like
Mariana Adams Foster

00:50.884 --> 00:52.302
and her activism app."

00:52.302 --> 00:54.346
I think that we have feelings
that are more than
professional.

00:54.346 --> 00:55.847
So these feelings.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.808
We just don't
feel them anymore?

00:57.808 --> 00:59.101
We can't.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.064
<i>Y'all ever notice that, uh,</i>

01:04.064 --> 01:07.192
‐ <i>porn sites have</i>
<i>share buttons these days?</i>
‐(light laughter)

01:07.192 --> 01:10.696
<i>Oh, come on, you prudes!</i>
<i>You know what</i>
<i>I'm talking about!</i>

01:10.696 --> 01:14.116
Okay, so, think of me
as your wing woman
reporting for duty.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.285
Lindsay:
<i>And I'm sitting there</i>
<i>thinking to myself,</i>

01:16.285 --> 01:18.203
<i>you know who would</i>
<i>love to see this?</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:22.708
<i>‐My Aunt Jane,</i>
<i>and my Uncle Bob...</i>
‐(crowd laughing)

01:22.708 --> 01:24.167
Her. What do you think?

01:24.167 --> 01:26.587
Subtle.
And I'm not looking.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.213
Do you mind if
I hit her up, then?

01:28.213 --> 01:30.340
I thought you were
my wing woman!

01:30.340 --> 01:33.343
‐Lindsay: <i>I'm Lindsay Brady.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
‐(all clapping and cheering)

01:35.220 --> 01:36.179
So good!

01:39.891 --> 01:41.268
Thanks, you guys,
for coming.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.020
Thanks for making us come.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.189
Look at you. Always flirting,
but never actually
going out with me.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.066
What? What did I say?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.277
Hey, why aren't you
going up tonight?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.446
I just haven't been feeling
very funny lately.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.448
Ever since Joey
broke up with her.

01:54.448 --> 01:58.243
Pro tip. Whenever I'm feeling
creatively stuck,

01:58.243 --> 02:00.996
I always just draw
from what's going on
in my life.

02:00.996 --> 02:02.622
Which is nothing,
in my case.

02:02.622 --> 02:06.084
Are you kidding me?
You manage a communal...
whatever,

02:06.084 --> 02:09.171
with batshit crazy tenants.
It's comedy gold.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.548
You know, I don't think
they'd appreciate me
making fun of them.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.091
"Everything is copy."

02:13.091 --> 02:14.968
Oh. She's on the move.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.345
(clears throat)

02:18.180 --> 02:21.099
Hey! Sorry to fan girl.
I, uh,

02:21.099 --> 02:23.101
I just wanted to say
you were great tonight.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.145
Thanks. That's very sweet.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.856
These are my friends,
Sumi and Alice.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.817
Alice Kwan.
I caught your set
a couple of weeks ago.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.194
You're hilarious.
(chuckles)

02:32.194 --> 02:35.197
Oh. Really?
I mean, thanks.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.277
‐Thank you. I appreciate it.
‐Yeah.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.154

Jerod?

I need it.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.243

03:29.167 --> 03:31.628
It wasn't yours to take from me.
I just need it back.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.713
Where's the bed?
Where'd you put all my shit?

03:34.047 --> 03:37.217
‐Ah, will you answer me!
(yells)
‐Jerod, I'm telling you again,

03:37.217 --> 03:39.636
you need to leave
my apartment right now,

03:39.636 --> 03:41.138
or I'll have to call the police.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.305
Stop it! What are you
looking at?

03:42.305 --> 03:44.808
You and the feds.

(soft laughter)

04:39.404 --> 04:42.324
Oh, hey.
Good morning.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.242
But is it?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.328
Your comedy mentor
and your ex?

04:46.328 --> 04:47.788
Are you good with this?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.499
Sumi:
Yeah. It was her idea.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.254
My last girlfriend went
back to her boyfriend
when we broke up.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.006
I've never even dated a guy.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.092
But you've had sex with one.
I'm a gold star.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.136
‐(laughs)
‐Sumi: I don't even look at men.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.847
‐What are men?
‐What are men?

05:05.847 --> 05:09.184
‐Those two should get a room.
‐Yeah. A padded one.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.062
‐(both chuckle)
‐To be honest, I...

05:12.938 --> 05:14.815
...just want to talk to you.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.403
‐Hey.
‐Oh!

05:20.403 --> 05:23.698
Um, so, I was thinking,

05:23.698 --> 05:26.159
if you really wanna
date Lindsay, go for it.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.412
What? What about
respecting boundaries?

05:29.412 --> 05:31.623
It's okay, as long as we give
each other permission, right?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.625
Um, I don't know.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.419
Ruby is hot,
and I think she's into me.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.880
Well, I think she might be
into Lindsay,

05:38.880 --> 05:40.382
so if you don't act fast,

05:40.382 --> 05:43.260
they're gonna hook up,
and this offer will expire.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.807
Okay. But you do not have
permission to be friends
with Meera.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.183
She's dead to me.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.853
This is exciting.
What should I do?

05:53.603 --> 05:55.897
Just go up to Lindsay
and ask to talk in private.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.065
You know. Nonchalant.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.360
Right.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.071
Nonchalant.
I can do nonchalant.

06:03.071 --> 06:07.450
(upbeat music playing)

06:12.247 --> 06:13.915
‐(soft moaning)
‐(kissing noises)

06:14.374 --> 06:15.917
So this was your idea.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.837
‐(Sumi laughs)
‐Kelly: Kinky.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.005
Maybe I'll join next time.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.051
Communal living.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.554
You know, rent includes water,
power, and spontaneous orgies.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.930
Hey, I wish.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.807
‐Sure.
‐(Kelly laughs)

06:31.725 --> 06:34.144
See? Material all around you.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.979
Yeah. All over.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.066
There's a reason they call it
a "man"‐ifesto.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.110
Why is no one else
talking about this?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.446
‐Are they really
gonna ignore it?
‐Casey: Are you surprised?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.073
What are you doing
about this manifesto?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.993
I can't do anything.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.078
Casey:
We all know this is what
the men around here think.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.371
Someone just wrote it down.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.040
But we were making a difference.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.708
We got the salary laddering.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.293
Yeah, and this is
what you call a backlash.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.711
Claire:
So we just grin and bear it?

06:59.711 --> 07:01.129
Rachel:
Evan needs to do something.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.422
It's the board.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.133
Okay, they were looking
for good PR. Not this.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.302
Okay, well, what about
an internal statement

07:07.302 --> 07:09.929
condemning the manifesto
and supporting the women
of <i>Speckulate</i> ?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.348
Why dignify it with
any response?

07:12.223 --> 07:14.476
I know how valuable
the women at Speckulate are.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.394
That's all that matters.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.647
All that matters is that
we prove that we're as good,

07:18.647 --> 07:20.315
if not better than
the male engineers.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.276
We can't let this
stupid manifesto
distract us.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.446
Success is undeniable,
so let's just get to work,
and figure this out.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.074
‐She's right.
‐Yeah. We need to focus.

07:29.074 --> 07:32.118
Okay, so first I was thinking
that we reach out to
grassroots organizations.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.037
It must have been Alex
who wrote it though, right?

07:34.037 --> 07:35.413
Gina/Rachel/Casey:
Oh, totally. Absolutely.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.374
The question is,
who told Alex?

07:38.833 --> 07:41.378
I told Alex.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.132
I have no idea who told Alex,
and we don't know that
it was him.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.179
(phone buzzing)

07:51.179 --> 07:53.264
Actually, uh,
you guys keep pitching.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.849
I have to take care
of something.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.982
(elevator dinging)

08:16.079 --> 08:17.038
Are you okay?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.760
Dennis:
<i>So, um, my friend, Davia,</i>

08:30.760 --> 08:33.430
the woman that's been
coming here with me,

08:33.430 --> 08:35.890
so I'm in love with her,
and I want to tell her.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.519
Woman:
<i>Well, it's hard</i>
<i>in a state of grief</i>

08:39.519 --> 08:43.064
<i>to know the difference</i>
<i>between love and need.</i>

08:45.734 --> 08:49.446
<i>That's why it's best</i>
<i>not to start any new</i>
<i>relationship too soon.</i>

08:50.238 --> 08:52.032
(tapping on phone)

08:58.246 --> 08:59.664
Hugo:
How'd that happen?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.252
Um, accident.
It was a work thing.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.504
Your mother told me
you quit your job.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.133
<i>She also said you need money.</i>

09:10.133 --> 09:12.802
I didn't say that.
I said money is tight right now,

09:12.802 --> 09:14.429
well, because, well...

09:14.429 --> 09:17.307
‐And you don't have
insurance anymore.
‐I do. It's just catastrophic,

09:17.307 --> 09:19.100
which has a crazy‐high
deductible.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.519
You didn't think of that
before you quit a
high‐paying job.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.521
I wanted to focus on art.

09:23.521 --> 09:24.898
That's a hobby.

09:27.358 --> 09:31.362
Hugo: <i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>don't dream, but you've</i>
<i>still gotta pay your bills.</i>

09:32.363 --> 09:33.698
(clatters)

09:33.698 --> 09:35.200
I'll write you a check.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.286
Thank you.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.039
You can work it off
at the store.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.501
Dad, we've been through this.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.212
Come on.
Come work with me.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.297
In the family business.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.591
I don't want to work there.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.056
(sighs)

10:11.611 --> 10:12.779
You need some help?

10:13.321 --> 10:14.823
Please.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.620
More importantly,
do you really want
a PB&J?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.789
(chuckles)
The price is right.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.082
Yeah.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.794
I'm gonna make you
a real sandwich.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.423
So, how'd you get
hooked into all of this?

10:32.423 --> 10:35.051
Oh, uh, Patrisse.
She introduced me to Lex.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.220
She thought I might be
interested in the work,

10:37.220 --> 10:39.139
since my father
was incarcerated.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.891
Yeah, I have family
in the system, too.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.895
‐So, are we, like,
the only interns?
‐I think so.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.982
I guess you're my competition.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.859
Oh! So now we're competing.

10:50.859 --> 10:54.154
‐(chuckles) You better
enjoy second place.
‐Okay. Yeah, whatever.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.530
‐We'll see.
We'll see what happens.
‐Yeah.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.991
‐(both chuckling)
‐Patrisse: Hey, y'all.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.075
Wow.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.493
‐Malika, I see you've met Zion.
‐Malika: Hey.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.037
‐Yeah.
‐Hey, Auntie. What's up?

11:03.037 --> 11:04.956
I'm good. You settling in?

11:04.956 --> 11:07.709
Yes. Thank you again
for this opportunity.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.960
You're welcome.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.130
Uh, Zion, can you
give us a minute?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.423
Oh, yeah, sure.
No problem.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.341
Um‐hmm.
(chuckling)

11:15.341 --> 11:17.760
Patrisse:
So, our BLM lawyer

11:17.760 --> 11:19.637
is gonna talk to you
about what to expect.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.306
before and during the trial.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.641
Have you told your family
that you're not taking
a deal yet?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.144
Um, no. Not yet.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.105
I mean, you got me.
You got BLM and DPN.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.232
But you're gonna need
your family.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.863
I have no idea how he got
in the building, or, um,

11:36.863 --> 11:38.907
or up here.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.909
I, uh, I left the door open.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.660
I was bringing in groceries.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.079
And there he was.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.915
(screaming)
Where's my bed?

11:50.418 --> 11:51.961
They're getting your room ready.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.049
‐Okay?
‐Stay away.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.927
Jerod:
Stay away! Stay away!
Stay away from me!

11:58.927 --> 12:01.179
‐Stay away.
‐I will. I will.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.682
I just thought...

12:06.142 --> 12:10.939
We could, uh, sit down,
and, and talk while they
get your room ready.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.527
I can't sleep.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.364
The feds are listening.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.158
They implanted something.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.286
They put something in my head.
They're tracking me,

12:25.286 --> 12:27.205
and listening.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.084
Where's my bed?

12:32.752 --> 12:36.047
Well, you can... you can
sleep here on the couch
until your bed's ready.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.135
‐Really?
‐Yeah, you can lay down.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.055
It's okay.
And I can keep you safe.

12:44.055 --> 12:47.475
‐Do you promise?
‐Yeah, I'll keep you safe.
I promise.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.103
'Cause I'm not,
I'm not gonna let
the feds in here.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.022
Okay? Come on.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.482
It's okay. It's okay.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.110
Okay.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.030
It's okay, Jerod.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.158
Okay.
'Cause you can trust me.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.246
You're safe now.
It's okay, yeah.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.211
You didn't need to throw him
on the ground like that.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.672
Officer Koert:
LAPD. On the floor!
On the floor!

13:17.672 --> 13:20.174
Officer Landis:
Hands! Let me see your hands!
Hands!

13:20.174 --> 13:23.011
‐He's having an episode!
‐(commotion and chattering)

13:23.011 --> 13:24.554
No, he's not violent!

13:24.554 --> 13:27.056
‐Officer Landis:
He wasn't complying.
‐We were following protocol.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.434
‐Callie: No, he's not violent!
‐(commotion and yelling)

13:29.434 --> 13:30.935
He's ill!

13:32.270 --> 13:34.647
<i>Stop! No, he's not violent!</i>
<i>He's not violent!</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:37.317
‐(Jerod yelling)
‐Callie: No,
please don't hurt him!

13:38.109 --> 13:40.278
‐And he could have hurt you.
‐He wasn't gonna hurt me.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.196
You don't know that.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.240
I don't wanna press charges.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.577
Can you let us talk about this

13:47.577 --> 13:50.580
before you make any decisions?

13:50.580 --> 13:52.832
Here's my card.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.792
Let us know was soon as possible
what you want to do.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.045
Thank you.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.256
Thank you so much,
uh, for everything.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.059
So, I talked to Alex.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.145
Hey. Did you write
the manifesto?

14:14.145 --> 14:18.858
No. Though I can't disagree with
some of its salient points.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.862
Bullshit. You were the only one
I told about Evan and the money.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.114
‐I might have told‐‐
‐Sam?

14:25.114 --> 14:28.826
‐Yes, and Sam told‐‐
‐Jeff, in design.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.369
And he told Trent
on orange team,

14:30.369 --> 14:32.080
and you know how chatty
the orange team is.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.749
I told you in confidence.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.626
I told you in confidence.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.087
Okay, so basically,
anyone could have
written the manifesto.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.297
But you know, if Evan
wanted to get to the
bottom of this, he could‐‐

14:41.297 --> 14:42.882
He has the board to deal with.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.050
Of course.
He could do no wrong.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.595
He's not the reason
I was singled out
in the manifesto.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.139
Should I be worried
that every time we have a fight,

14:50.139 --> 14:52.100
you're gonna run and spill
to the nearest douche?

14:52.100 --> 14:55.228
No. Look,
you don't have to worry.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.106
You can trust me.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.568
Gotta get back to the team.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.153
I have to make
this app successful.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.404
It's the only way
to fight back.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.624
I'll make this right. I promise.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.044
I need a glass of water.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.762
We all make mistakes.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.974
Especially when we're hurt,
we can do, or...

15:32.974 --> 15:34.725
say the wrong things.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.311
Um, I don't know
if she'll ever forgive me.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.313
She will forgive you.
She loves you.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.358
'Cause you're an amazing guy.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.361
Okay?

15:52.535 --> 15:54.495
(tapping on phone)

16:10.720 --> 16:11.846
(sniffles)

16:16.017 --> 16:17.727

‐(shattering)

16:19.187 --> 16:20.313
(shudders)

16:29.614 --> 16:30.531
Mm.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.203
That's the best sandwich
I've ever had.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.246
It's a tuna melt.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.165
‐Well, it's amazing.
‐(chuckles)

16:41.209 --> 16:44.003
So what do you
do around here all day?

16:44.545 --> 16:47.632
I mean, now that I can't work,
I am going crazy.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.426
Mm. You get used to it.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.554
What do you do for money?
Are you, like, a day trader?

16:53.554 --> 16:55.598
(laughs)
No.

16:55.598 --> 16:59.101
‐You have, like, a trust fund?
‐I wish.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.478
(chuckles)

17:00.478 --> 17:02.104
‐Dennis: Go for it.
‐No, it's all you.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.107
‐No, you can‐‐
‐No, you made the sandwich,
so...

17:06.275 --> 17:08.236
I'll tell you what.

17:08.236 --> 17:11.155
It's yours,
if you drink the brine.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.116
(chuckles)

17:16.035 --> 17:19.121
‐All of it?
‐I mean, unless‐‐
unless you can't handle it.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.959
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.546
‐Um.
‐Cheers.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.298

22:03.739 --> 22:04.990
Uh, thank you for dinner.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.120
It was good.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.123
I'll call you later.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.166
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.177
(door opens)

22:25.928 --> 22:27.054
Hey.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.557
Isabella:
Hi. So...

22:29.557 --> 22:32.059
Oh, my God.
What happened?

22:33.394 --> 22:37.565
I opened a window,
and a bird flew into the mirror.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.650
Oh my, God.
Is the bird okay?

22:41.110 --> 22:43.821
Yeah. Yeah. No, um,
it was just stunned,

22:43.821 --> 22:46.907
so I put it on the ledge
and it, it flew away.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.412
I'll pay to fix
the mirror, though.

22:51.412 --> 22:55.249
‐No. No, we can split it.
‐No, it was my fault.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.668
It's my mirror.
Let me pay for half.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.087
Okay.

23:02.464 --> 23:06.176
So, how are you and Raj?
Are you still mad at him?

23:06.176 --> 23:07.928
Uh...

23:09.179 --> 23:10.931
I don't wanna be.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.184
Yeah, I get it.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.769
It was a betrayal.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.563
And what, every time
he gets mad at you,

23:17.563 --> 23:19.356
he's just gonna
throw you under the bus?

23:19.356 --> 23:20.482
Exactly.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.527
Raj is a great guy.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.738
Maybe it was just a mistake.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.994
Or maybe it's a red flag.

23:36.874 --> 23:39.627
Rachel:
Yeah, but she's always
defending Evan.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.338
Claire:
And would he use his own money
to bail out any of our apps?

23:42.338 --> 23:45.174
Casey: Would we question
their relationship if
Mariana was a guy?

23:45.174 --> 23:46.967
‐Gina: You're right.
‐Okay, but,

23:46.967 --> 23:48.677
if they are really close,

23:48.677 --> 23:51.347
why is she letting him
sweep the manifesto
under the rug?

23:51.347 --> 23:54.141
I mean, whose back
does she really have?

23:59.188 --> 24:02.524
Callie:
<i>Aah! No, no, no!</i>
<i>Don't hurt him!</i>

24:02.524 --> 24:05.527
(commotion and yelling)

24:05.527 --> 24:07.404
‐Jerod: <i>Aah!</i>
‐Callie: <i>It's okay, Jerod!</i>

24:11.241 --> 24:14.078
Hailie:
<i>Malika told me what happened.</i>

24:14.078 --> 24:15.621
You did the right thing.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.165
The problem is, the police
tend to ramp up the conflict.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.084
They're not trained
to deescalate them,

24:20.084 --> 24:22.586
especially when someone's
having a mental health episode.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.464
So, I have no idea
where they took him.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.716
Is there any chance
you could help me find him?

24:27.716 --> 24:29.885
We found out they released him.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.220
But he needs help.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.138
People don't get well
in a cell.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.475
Couldn't they take him to, like,
a mental health facility?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.060
Hailie:
There aren't enough beds,

24:38.060 --> 24:41.271
and some of those places
are just jails by another name.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.983
We just fought to get
the board of supervisors
to cancel a contract

24:43.983 --> 24:47.069
to build a 3,000 bed
mental health prison
in Koreatown.

24:47.069 --> 24:48.696
But don't we need more beds?

24:48.696 --> 24:51.198
And won't they get help
even if it's locked down?

24:51.198 --> 24:53.200
Not if it's run by
the sheriff's department.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.284
They're not
trained professionals.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.953
Right. They're
trained as guards.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.163
And people who are mentally ill

24:58.163 --> 24:59.581
shouldn't be treated
like criminals.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.375
Hailie:
The city needs to allocate funds

25:01.375 --> 25:03.544
for smaller,
community based facilities,

25:03.544 --> 25:04.962
run by mental health experts.

25:06.130 --> 25:09.008
So they took all
of Jerod's things?

25:09.008 --> 25:10.843
He doesn't have anything
to come back to.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.344
That's another thing.
They do these sweeps

25:12.344 --> 25:15.097
where they throw away
all these people's belongings.

25:15.097 --> 25:19.143
Precious family photos.
Sometimes the medications
they need.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.061
Why does it seem like
it's gotten so much worse?

25:21.061 --> 25:24.023
Because it has.
If we don't do things like
raise the minimum wage

25:24.023 --> 25:27.234
and protect renters' rights,
it will only get worse.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.738
(knocking)

25:34.491 --> 25:36.660
Do you still want to keep
Speckulate from going public?

25:36.660 --> 25:38.120
Yes.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.456
Then why are you staying silent
about this whole manifesto?

25:40.456 --> 25:42.124
Why not attract more bad PR?

25:43.876 --> 25:46.211
‐How?
‐Make it a story.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.338
Find out who wrote it
and fire them.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.258
You'll be doing the right thing
while hurting your public
trading value.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.634
It's win‐win.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.805
<i>I live with roommates.</i>

25:56.805 --> 25:59.099
<i>I'm sure a lot of you</i>
<i>can relate.</i>
<i>They're annoying.</i>

25:59.099 --> 26:00.768
<i>And they're my parents.</i>

26:00.768 --> 26:03.145
(crowd laughing)

26:03.145 --> 26:06.148
Are you okay?
I've never seen you like this
before a show.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.441
They're a little nervous.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.070
There's a scout

26:11.070 --> 26:12.988
from Comedy Be TV

26:12.988 --> 26:14.990
who's gonna be
in the audience tonight.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.867
They have this whole
diversity program.

26:16.867 --> 26:19.203
I've known a couple comics
that have gotten it.

26:19.203 --> 26:22.498
They've got comedy specials
and TV development deals.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.792
It's big.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.086
Wow. But don't be nervous.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.463
I mean, if they're here,
they already want you,
you know?

26:29.463 --> 26:32.049
So, just go out there
and kill it as usual.
Yeah.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.051
<i>But seriously,</i>
<i>I'm thinking about</i>

26:34.051 --> 26:37.387
<i>looking into one of those,</i>
<i>like, communal living</i>
<i>sort of situations, you know?</i>

26:37.387 --> 26:40.724
<i>I'm just looking for</i>
<i>the ad that says,</i>
<i>"Rent includes power,</i>

26:40.724 --> 26:43.185
<i>water, spontaneous orgies."</i>

26:43.185 --> 26:45.187
‐(crowd laughing)
‐Alice: <i>Communal living.</i>

26:45.187 --> 26:48.232
You know, rent includes
water, power, and
spontaneous orgies.

26:48.232 --> 26:49.191
(laughing)

26:49.650 --> 26:52.486
‐Lindsay:
<i>The WiFi password is "orgy"!</i>
‐(crowd laughing)

26:52.486 --> 26:54.822
Lindsay:
<i>$1250 and under.</i>
<i>Somewhere around there.</i>

26:56.281 --> 26:59.284
So, the city attorney
doesn't want this trial.

26:59.284 --> 27:02.204
She's willing to drop
the "no protesting"
condition of the deal,

27:02.204 --> 27:04.623
and drop a month
down to two weeks in jail,

27:04.623 --> 27:06.667
and this whole thing goes away.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.795
Patrisse:
Whatever you want,
we got you.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.047
Yeah, I say do it.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.007
Get this over with.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.968
Don't risk something worse.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.095
Dad?

27:20.556 --> 27:23.892
I realize before,
I was telling you to lay down.

27:23.892 --> 27:27.145
Just accept your fate.
But that's not you.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.064
They don't want a trial.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.066
I think you call their bluff.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.318
‐Dom: Of course.
‐Dom‐‐

27:33.318 --> 27:36.655
What, you think doing time
is some type of badge
of honor or something?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.532
‐No.
‐Dom: I mean, you do
realize you going to jail

27:38.532 --> 27:40.909
was the worst thing
that happened to
our family, right?

27:40.909 --> 27:44.037
Matter of fact, you know what?
Mom would probably still be here
if she never even met you.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.914
But you wouldn't.
How about a little respect?

27:45.914 --> 27:47.833
Yo, you don't deserve
my respect.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.129
‐I'll show you what you deserve.
‐No, Dom, come on.
Settle down.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.630
No, I got this.
You wanna come for me, son?

27:53.630 --> 27:55.173
‐No! Stop, now!
‐Let's do this.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.174
‐I don't even know
why you're here!
‐Stop!

27:56.174 --> 27:57.134
I thought this was
family business.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.927
Your sister asked me here.
Maybe you should go.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.138
Y'all both need to go,
now.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.477
(exhales)

28:07.477 --> 28:08.979
No.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.107
He should stay.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.067
‐I'll go.
‐Dad.

28:14.735 --> 28:15.986
It's all good.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.030
I'll talk to you later.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.080
(door closes)

28:32.085 --> 28:34.254
Ooh. That's a
pleasant surprise.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.339
I aim to please.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.549
‐And you do.
‐Ooh.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.217
(laughs)

28:39.217 --> 28:43.555
So, I talked to the building
security manager today.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.141
Some delivery guys left
the lobby door open,

28:46.141 --> 28:49.436
and Jerod came up
from the service elevator,

28:49.436 --> 28:51.063
which apparently,
anyone can access.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.357
Or could.
Until I read 'em
the riot act.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.025
Did you see they cleared
all his stuff out?

28:55.025 --> 28:57.402
Well, that's not
such a bad thing.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.321
Where is he
supposed to go now?

28:59.321 --> 29:01.490
There are shelters.

29:01.490 --> 29:04.242
Which are full.
Most of them.

29:04.242 --> 29:08.121
We have a real problem
with people living in tents
in this city.

29:08.121 --> 29:12.167
No, we've got a real problem
with low wages

29:12.167 --> 29:14.336
and lack of affordable housing.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.797
Not to mention addiction
and mental illness,

29:16.797 --> 29:19.967
and the fact that a lot
of these people don't
want to be housed.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.176
They need help.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.179
They need to be willing
to accept help.

29:24.179 --> 29:28.058
And frankly, I'm not sure
the city should let them
pitch tents wherever they want.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.018
It just makes it easier
for them to stay on the streets.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.229
So we force them
into subsidized housing?

29:32.229 --> 29:34.231
Look, I don't know
what the answer is.

29:34.231 --> 29:37.025
All I know is some homeless guy
having a psychotic episode

29:37.025 --> 29:40.195
followed you home
to our apartment and
could have hurt you,

29:40.195 --> 29:43.073
‐whether you want
to believe that or not.
‐He's out there tonight.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.449
Without shelter.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.535
There's nothing we
can do about it, Callie.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.288
See, that's the problem.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.708
As long as we all think
that there's nothing
we can do about it,

29:52.708 --> 29:54.501
then there's nothing
we will do about it.

30:01.216 --> 30:05.012
<i>So, a lot of people</i>
<i>see sex as a way</i>
<i>to connect with people.</i>

30:05.012 --> 30:07.139
<i>I kind of see it as,</i>
<i>like, signing a lease.</i>

30:07.139 --> 30:09.141
‐(crowd laughing)
‐ <i>This might not be</i>
<i>your forever home,</i>

30:09.141 --> 30:11.143
<i>but you're definitely here</i>
<i>for at least a year.</i>

30:21.153 --> 30:22.529
(chuckles)

30:22.988 --> 30:24.197
Morning.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.658
I had fun last night.

30:27.284 --> 30:28.285
Me, too.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.628
Maybe we can
do it again some time.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.422
You know,
have more fun.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.840
Nothing serious, of course.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.175
Uh...
(chuckles)

30:48.096 --> 30:50.599
I really like you.
A lot.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.143
And that's the problem.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.270
Mm.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.272
I think we'd have too much fun,

30:57.272 --> 30:58.982
and then I'd be back
in a relationship,

30:58.982 --> 31:02.152
and I'm really trying
to not do that right now.

31:02.152 --> 31:04.196
I really need to be
single for a while.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.742
Yeah. Good point. Me, too.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.869
But thanks for a great night.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.460
<i>You know, I'm sowing</i>
<i>my wild gay oats.</i>
(chuckles)

31:18.460 --> 31:20.170
<i>‐Cool. Cool.</i>
<i>I'm doing it.</i>
‐(cheering)

31:20.170 --> 31:23.673
<i>I mean, who needs a sense</i>
<i>of emotional security or</i>
<i>to be loved?</i>

31:23.673 --> 31:26.176
<i>I'm getting laid!</i>

31:26.176 --> 31:27.928
‐(crowd laughing)
‐(Alice laughing)

31:27.928 --> 31:29.805
<i>All right, I'm Alice Kwan.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

31:29.805 --> 31:32.265
(crowd cheering and clapping)

31:40.107 --> 31:43.735
‐Ruby, hey.
‐Hey. You were great.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.362
Sorry.
I should have asked you

31:45.362 --> 31:47.489
before I used
our hookup as material.

31:47.489 --> 31:50.158
Uh, it's fine.
Everything's copy.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.245
That's what I hear.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.456
Unless someone copies
your copy.

31:57.791 --> 32:02.212
Um, would you like to join us
for a "just friends" drink?

32:04.131 --> 32:05.382
Hi!

32:05.382 --> 32:07.551
Actually, I would.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.345
‐Alice: Hey.
‐Lindsay: Hi.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.639
‐Hi!
‐Hi! Good to see you again.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.724
Ruby:
Nice to see you, too.

32:14.724 --> 32:18.019
‐Lindsay, you were
on fire tonight.
‐Thanks.

32:18.019 --> 32:22.524
How would you like to audition
for the Comedy Be TV
diversity program?

32:22.524 --> 32:24.109
You're the scout?

32:24.109 --> 32:25.777
Ruby:
I like to keep a low profile.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.779
I don't wanna
make anybody nervous.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.407
So what you do think?

32:30.407 --> 32:32.284
Wow.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.077
I mean, I'd love to.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.621
And Alice, what about you?

32:36.621 --> 32:39.166
Would you be interested
in auditioning, as well?
