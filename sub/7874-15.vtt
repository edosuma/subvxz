00:35.061 --> 00:38.773
Come on, people. Give me one
original way to assassinate somebody...

00:38.940 --> 00:41.109
...and we can all go home.

00:41.276 --> 00:43.568
- Jeez, come on.
- Man, this sucks.

00:44.027 --> 00:48.156
I got it. Okay, first we hire a midget.

00:48.323 --> 00:50.951
- I'm listening.
- When the target starts his car...

00:51.118 --> 00:52.869
...said midget, now in our employ...

00:53.036 --> 00:55.288
...bursts out of the air bag
and strangles him.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.581
That'll get him. Good thinking, Stan.

00:57.748 --> 01:03.254
Congratulations, Smith,
that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

01:03.421 --> 01:06.007
- Guess we're eating dinner here.
- Again.

01:06.173 --> 01:08.592
Bullock's made us work late
every night this week.

01:08.759 --> 01:12.137
You know why? Bullock's wife is still
being held hostage in Fallujah.

01:12.303 --> 01:14.305
Who wants to go home
to an empty house?

01:14.472 --> 01:16.349
Where shall we order?
Hoagies and Wings?

01:16.516 --> 01:20.103
One of us has to find a woman
for Bullock so he won't wanna work late.

01:20.270 --> 01:22.355
Great idea, Jackson.

01:22.522 --> 01:26.608
Wow, they have hoagies and wings.
Oh, they also have hamburgers.

01:26.775 --> 01:29.695
I think this place
is trying to do too much.

01:30.446 --> 01:32.197
Damn it.

01:32.948 --> 01:35.325
You want to set Bullock up
with one of my friends?

01:35.492 --> 01:37.869
Come on, Francine,
I'm sick of working late.

01:38.036 --> 01:41.122
Hey, I know the perfect match.
Your friend Melinda.

01:41.289 --> 01:43.583
- I don't know.
- Nonsense. It'll be great.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.293
All right, I'll call her.

01:45.460 --> 01:49.589
But if this doesn't work out,
remember, I told you...

01:49.756 --> 01:52.924
Klaus had a little accident.
We're gonna need some paper towels.

01:53.091 --> 01:55.552
Oh, I have some of those.

01:58.096 --> 02:00.724
- Dude, what the hell?
- I needed a diversion.

02:00.891 --> 02:03.685
Francine was dangerously close
to saying the four words...

02:03.852 --> 02:06.437
...I never ever wanna hear
from her again:

02:07.271 --> 02:09.648
"I told you so."

02:09.815 --> 02:13.277
She's said it to me exactly four times
in our marriage.

02:14.653 --> 02:16.280
I told you so.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.199
I told you so.

02:20.450 --> 02:22.327
I told you so.

02:24.996 --> 02:27.499
I told you so.

02:28.708 --> 02:31.127
I cannot hear those words again.

02:31.336 --> 02:36.632
And I'll do whatever it takes to keep her
from saying them, as God is my witness.

02:37.841 --> 02:41.220
- Weird. Not a cloud in the sky.
- Yeah, I know. Must be heat lightning.

02:45.390 --> 02:48.184
This pedometer
is the best Christmas gift ever.

02:48.351 --> 02:50.353
Thanks, Roger.
Don't mention it, Roger.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.980
Steve, hydrate me.

02:53.397 --> 02:55.525
Over here.

02:56.108 --> 02:59.028
- What is that?
- A Manhattan. I feel great. And look:

03:00.445 --> 03:02.155
I lost half a pound since Tuesday.

03:02.322 --> 03:04.991
You look thin
and, therefore, have value.

03:05.158 --> 03:07.369
There he is, Mommy, the monster.

03:07.577 --> 03:11.039
- Timmy, it's not nice to point.
- But he doesn't have a nose.

03:12.249 --> 03:14.291
He can't help it if he's deformed.

03:14.458 --> 03:18.420
Deformed? I'm just as God made me,
madam.

03:28.096 --> 03:30.848
Relax, sir. You've never looked
more beautiful.

03:31.015 --> 03:33.518
I'm just a bit rusty at pitching woo.

03:33.685 --> 03:36.062
Oh, there she is. Melinda.

03:36.229 --> 03:40.108
Oh, God, Francine. Please tell me
this is my blind date's father.

03:41.275 --> 03:44.528
I knew this was a bad idea.
I told you...

03:44.695 --> 03:47.406
Hey, hey, come on. We all just got off
on the wrong foot.

03:47.572 --> 03:51.034
Let me buy us a round of drinks.
Waiter, 15 kamikazes.

03:55.371 --> 04:00.584
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
let's see how you like it on the floor.

04:01.252 --> 04:03.838
Hey, Roger, we have something
that might cheer you up.

04:04.005 --> 04:07.091
Don't look at me. I'm hideous.
I'm a noseless freak.

04:07.258 --> 04:11.052
- Not any more.
- Rick Baker's Celebrity Nose Kit?

04:11.219 --> 04:14.389
They're latex copies
of actual celebrity noses.

04:14.556 --> 04:16.850
Just like porn stars do
with their genitals.

04:17.017 --> 04:19.310
Shall we get started?

04:37.368 --> 04:42.248
- Maybe this was a bad idea.
- Oh, my God, it's perfect.

04:42.415 --> 04:46.044
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting the Kevin Bacon.

04:46.836 --> 04:48.921
Roger, you look awesome.

04:49.088 --> 04:52.257
Tomorrow, we're going to the park.
I can't wait to show my nose...

04:52.424 --> 04:54.301
...to that kid who spited my face.

04:58.847 --> 05:04.351
Francine, why didn't you warn me
about Avery's unbelievably sexy accent?

05:04.518 --> 05:06.937
Ben Roethlisberger.

05:07.104 --> 05:09.732
Oh, yeah.

05:09.899 --> 05:13.694
Well, looks like my late nights
at the office are finally over.

05:13.861 --> 05:16.447
Oh, Stan, nothing turns me on...

05:16.614 --> 05:20.658
...like watching a dear friend
get worked over by an old man.

05:20.825 --> 05:22.076
Well, you're drunk enough.

05:22.243 --> 05:24.412
Francine and I are gonna go
have the maritals.

05:24.579 --> 05:28.333
I just hope I don't premarital
in the car on the way home.

05:30.876 --> 05:33.295
- Hello?
- Smith, we have a problem.

05:36.256 --> 05:39.134
It's about bloody time.

05:39.676 --> 05:43.263
This is your fault, Smith. I told you
I was rusty when it came to dating.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.224
I don't understand.
I thought you and Melinda hit it off.

05:46.390 --> 05:48.976
We did. Lovely woman.
Things were going swimmingly.

05:49.143 --> 05:53.064
And then I made
the most terrible blunder.

05:53.231 --> 05:55.816
- Oh, my God. Is she dead?
- Quite.

05:55.983 --> 05:57.735
Boy, you are rusty.

06:01.780 --> 06:03.532
Sir, you killed your date?

06:03.698 --> 06:05.867
What in the name
of Phil Spector happened?

06:06.034 --> 06:07.619
Everything was going so well.

06:07.786 --> 06:10.455
<i>Previously, on my blind date:</i>

06:10.622 --> 06:12.581
I don't normally move this fast.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.254
I never thought I could feel this way
about someone other than my wife.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.261
- I'm gonna go powder my nose.
- I'll freshen your drink.

06:34.143 --> 06:38.022
I thought she was a terrorist.
Curse my CIA-honed reflexes.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.066
Sir, this is a disaster.
Do you realize what you've done?

06:41.233 --> 06:43.443
I've ended a life in its prime.

06:43.610 --> 06:47.155
Worse. You've given my wife a reason
to say "I told you so."

06:47.322 --> 06:49.157
She knew this date wouldn't work out.

06:49.324 --> 06:51.410
Your wife will never know.
No one will.

06:51.576 --> 06:54.412
One of us will have to bury this body
in the woods.

06:54.578 --> 06:57.790
Of course, sir. But how do we decide
which one of us will...

06:57.957 --> 06:59.041
Damn it.

07:00.710 --> 07:01.794
There he is.

07:01.961 --> 07:04.463
That little feelings hurter
is about to eat crow.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.132
I'm gonna go rub his nose in my nose.

07:08.216 --> 07:10.260
Mommy, look, it's the monster.

07:11.344 --> 07:13.638
<i>The monster from the hit movie
Hollow Man.</i>

07:13.805 --> 07:16.766
Oh, my God. It is Kevin Bacon.

07:17.767 --> 07:20.728
Normally, I'd chastise you
for watching an R-rated movie...

07:20.894 --> 07:23.689
...but Kevin Bacon
is an American treasure...

07:23.856 --> 07:26.525
...even when he's playing
an invisible rapist.

07:26.692 --> 07:27.776
<i>Stir of Echoes.</i>

07:27.943 --> 07:30.237
<i>- Tremors won three Saturn Awards.
- Saturn Award?</i>

07:30.404 --> 07:33.282
- You're missing the point.
- You're right. Kevin Bacon.

07:33.449 --> 07:36.367
- They think you're Kevin Bacon.
- Yes, I understand things...

07:36.534 --> 07:37.827
...that happen around me.

07:37.994 --> 07:39.996
Mr. Bacon, would you
and your entourage...

07:40.163 --> 07:43.499
...like to dine at my fancy eatery?
On the house, of course.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.962
Do we milk this Bacon thing
for all the free stuff we can get?

07:49.129 --> 07:52.132
Or do we wuss out? Let's vote.
Hayley, you don't get to vote.

07:52.299 --> 07:57.012
- I was gonna vote for free stuff.
- Really? Well, look at you. Okay.

07:58.847 --> 08:02.892
God, I'm so hung-over.
Last night is such a haze.

08:03.059 --> 08:05.978
But it seems like that blind date
was a big success.

08:06.145 --> 08:09.482
I think I'll stop by Melinda's today
and get the details.

08:09.648 --> 08:12.443
- No, don't do that.
- Why? Did something go wrong?

08:12.610 --> 08:16.488
No. It's just that, well, you and Melinda
got in a big fight last night.

08:16.654 --> 08:20.158
- She never wants to talk to you again.
- But Melinda and I never fight.

08:20.325 --> 08:23.495
Well, normally, no. But you know
how nasty you get when you drink.

08:23.661 --> 08:26.956
- I do? I didn't know that.
- That's because you always black out.

08:27.123 --> 08:29.625
Look, Francine, your friendship
is dead and buried.

08:29.792 --> 08:33.419
Buried behind the Olive Garden.
The one in Richmond.

08:33.587 --> 08:36.089
I'm gonna pay a hobo to say
we were playing squash...

08:36.256 --> 08:38.842
...until very late last night.

08:42.261 --> 08:45.807
Hey, wine guy. Kevin Bacon wants
another free bottle...

08:45.973 --> 08:48.184
...of your most expensive wine.

08:48.351 --> 08:51.479
But, Mr. Bacon, you've already had
five premium bottles.

08:51.646 --> 08:53.189
Oh, okay. All right, okay.

08:53.356 --> 08:56.776
<i>Hey, I'm doing the back page
of Vanity Fair next week.</i>

08:56.943 --> 08:59.778
When they ask me
what my greatest loss in life was...

08:59.945 --> 09:02.113
...I'll say the two feet
of lower intestine...

09:02.280 --> 09:05.116
...that had to be removed
after I ate at this dump.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.953
No. Mr. Bacon, of course,
it's on the house.

09:08.119 --> 09:11.413
You bet your ass it is.
I'm Kevin Bacon.

09:11.580 --> 09:15.167
- Roger, we can't keep doing this.
- Yeah. I mean, it's stealing.

09:15.334 --> 09:18.546
Oh, excuse me. Are you an ethicist?
Are you?

09:18.712 --> 09:20.673
Is there an ethicist in the house?

09:20.839 --> 09:24.884
- I'm an ethicist.
- Well, screw you, I'm Kevin Bacon.

09:27.387 --> 09:30.139
I heard Bullock's got another
all nighter planned for us.

09:30.306 --> 09:31.599
Man.

09:31.766 --> 09:35.311
Thank you for taking the time.
I'm worried about Melinda.

09:35.478 --> 09:38.897
I went by her apartment to apologize
and she wasn't there.

09:39.064 --> 09:42.276
- How odd.
- I don't think she ever made it home.

09:42.442 --> 09:46.488
- How curious.
- How can you be sure?

09:46.655 --> 09:49.074
There was a Thai menu hanging
from her doorknob...

09:49.241 --> 09:51.827
...which doesn't add up
because she loves Thai food...

09:51.993 --> 09:54.036
...and she hates doorknob clutter.

09:54.203 --> 09:57.707
- I'm sure she's fine.
- You're probably right.

09:57.873 --> 10:02.545
I guess I should wait another day
before going to the police.

10:02.837 --> 10:06.464
It appears we have a pig
in our truffle patch.

10:06.631 --> 10:09.926
Sir, my wife has to believe
your date was a success.

10:10.093 --> 10:13.263
- Don't worry. I'll throw her off the trail.
- Thank you, sir.

10:13.430 --> 10:17.600
Oh, while I have you, does Francine have
any other single friends?

10:17.767 --> 10:21.603
This whole thing with Melinda
has made me really horny.

10:30.195 --> 10:33.531
- Francine, you're blocking me.
- I'm in the shower.

10:33.698 --> 10:35.950
- Where are your keys?
- On the hook.

10:36.117 --> 10:37.910
I'm looking at the hook. Not there.

10:38.077 --> 10:41.205
- Check the bowl.
- Got them. They were in the bowl.

10:41.372 --> 10:43.333
But they were supposed to be
on the hook.

10:43.499 --> 10:47.002
- I can't hear you.
- You could hear me five seconds ago.

10:47.169 --> 10:50.297
Can you bring me a towel?

10:53.550 --> 10:57.262
Thai food. They should fine these people
for littering.

11:00.223 --> 11:02.808
My knee. God bless it.

11:25.121 --> 11:29.541
- Hey, you're not Francine.
- You're an assassin. A midget assassin.

11:29.708 --> 11:32.377
Oh, my God,
Bullock's trying to kill my wife.

11:32.544 --> 11:34.296
With my idea.

11:34.463 --> 11:37.549
Can you drop me off at the dealership?
They gotta repack me.

11:37.716 --> 11:41.095
That's how you try to throw Francine
off the trail, by killing her?

11:41.261 --> 11:44.305
Maybe she should go to the police.
At least then she'd be safe.

11:44.472 --> 11:47.809
Fine, Stan. But if you don't want
her to say "I told you so"...

11:47.975 --> 11:51.395
...there's only one option.
- There's gotta be another way.

11:51.562 --> 11:54.357
There is none. She can either be dead
or she can be right.

11:54.524 --> 11:56.983
Now, you take care of your wife
or I will.

11:57.150 --> 12:01.947
And next time, Smith,
I won't be using a midget.

12:06.201 --> 12:09.037
- I'm gonna wear these out.
- Great. I'll ring those up.

12:09.204 --> 12:12.248
Jump back.
Do you know who I am, clerk face?

12:12.414 --> 12:15.626
Jeez, Roger, you're making Kevin Bacon
look like a total douche.

12:15.793 --> 12:18.546
You may be beautiful on the outside
like Kevin Bacon...

12:18.712 --> 12:21.465
...but you're ugly on the inside
like Tommy Lee Jones.

12:21.632 --> 12:23.925
On the outside and the inside.

12:24.092 --> 12:27.887
You know what? Kevin Bacon is gonna
take as much free stuff as he wants.

12:28.054 --> 12:31.975
He doesn't need you.
It's time for me to cut loose, footloose.

12:32.141 --> 12:36.604
So why don't you two get lost before
I kick off my Sunday shoe up your ass.

13:49.338 --> 13:51.631
I'm so glad you were able
to track Melinda down.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.510
- I just wanna clear the air with her.
- Well, she's still pretty mad at you.

13:55.677 --> 13:58.472
We'll work it out.
I wonder what's keeping her?

13:58.638 --> 14:00.097
- Is that her?
- Where?

14:00.264 --> 14:02.224
- In the red hat.
- That's a hat rack.

14:02.391 --> 14:06.479
- Yeah, the hat rack. Is that her?
- No, I don't think that's her.

14:06.645 --> 14:09.231
Oh, well. Now drink your poison.

14:24.287 --> 14:27.790
Melinda? Oh, my God,
what happened?

14:27.956 --> 14:30.250
You killed her.

14:35.756 --> 14:38.967
I killed Melinda?
I don't remember anything.

14:39.134 --> 14:42.095
That's because you got drunk
and blacked out, again.

14:42.261 --> 14:45.389
What is she doing here?
Why is she wearing lingerie?

14:45.556 --> 14:48.559
- Why is she covered in dirt?
- Let me start from the beginning.

14:48.726 --> 14:52.355
Melinda met us at the bar but she didn't
have her ID and they were carding.

14:52.522 --> 14:56.024
So we came back here. You both put on
lingerie and started mudwrestling.

14:56.191 --> 14:58.568
But you began arguing over
who would shower first.

14:58.735 --> 15:00.737
You made good points,
but got out of hand.

15:00.904 --> 15:03.406
You stabbed her
with your knife set and...

15:03.573 --> 15:04.866
Yeah, I think that's it.

15:05.033 --> 15:08.911
This is awful. We have to call the police.
I have to turn myself in.

15:09.078 --> 15:11.831
Whoa, murderer.
Don't you think that's a little selfish?

15:11.997 --> 15:15.626
- What would your family do?
- But I killed my friend.

15:15.793 --> 15:18.128
How can I live with myself?

15:18.295 --> 15:22.215
Don't worry, honey. I'll help you put
this horrible business behind you.

15:24.259 --> 15:26.427
Trust me, honey. This is the best way.

15:26.594 --> 15:30.974
We have to destroy the body
so you won't be implicated.

15:31.140 --> 15:34.644
There. Now you have closure
and our grass will be green all winter.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.399
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Where's your nose, Kevin?

15:40.566 --> 15:43.443
Shouldn't you be out raping
the star-struck masses with it?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.363
Nose? What are you...?
Oh, oh, that. Yeah, yeah.

15:46.530 --> 15:50.908
Look, I really owe you guys an apology.
I lost sight of what's important.

15:51.075 --> 15:55.746
It's not what you have right here,
it's what you have right here.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.750
- That's where my heart is.
- You were a real jerk, Roger.

15:59.917 --> 16:04.629
Guilty. And the worst part is,
it almost cost me my friends.

16:04.796 --> 16:06.798
Hugs?

16:06.965 --> 16:11.011
In celebrity news, Kevin Bacon
was involved in a hit-and-run accident...

16:11.177 --> 16:13.555
...right here in Langley Falls.
- What?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.474
The whole incident was captured
by a nearby traffic cam.

16:32.739 --> 16:36.868
Bacon fled and was arrested 20 minutes
later, across the country, in Hollywood.

16:37.035 --> 16:41.664
I didn't think I did it,
but it's clearly me on the tape.

16:42.582 --> 16:43.666
Roger.

16:43.833 --> 16:47.669
I'm gonna turn this cheese sandwich
into a panini.

16:53.050 --> 16:58.554
I'm leaving, Stan. I killed someone
and it's tearing my soul apart.

16:58.721 --> 17:00.681
If I can't turn myself in...

17:00.848 --> 17:03.934
...then I've gotta dedicate my life
to helping others.

17:04.101 --> 17:07.188
I'm going to India to care for the poor.

17:07.355 --> 17:10.066
- Tell the children I love them.
- Wait, Francine.

17:10.232 --> 17:12.192
You're not the monster
you think you are.

17:12.358 --> 17:13.777
Of course I am.

17:13.943 --> 17:17.864
I've gone over that whole terrible night
two times in my head...

17:18.031 --> 17:22.242
...and the only other explanation is
that someone's framing me.

17:22.410 --> 17:26.288
But who would do something
so awful?

17:28.415 --> 17:31.585
There's six months worth of casseroles
in the freezer.

17:31.752 --> 17:34.129
I love you.

17:38.092 --> 17:40.134
- I really miss Mom.
- Me too.

17:40.301 --> 17:42.595
I don't miss her six-month supply
of casseroles.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.722
Man, I'm glad we finally finished them.

17:44.889 --> 17:48.518
I wish Dad hadn't added those noodles
to make them last twice as long.

17:48.684 --> 17:51.771
What choice did he have?
Freezer burn ruined 90 percent of them.

17:51.938 --> 17:56.358
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
I can do this. Six divided by...

17:56.525 --> 17:58.318
Carry the noodle...

17:58.485 --> 18:00.153
It's two months later.

18:01.571 --> 18:05.450
We're sad about your mom being gone,
but here's something to cheer us all up:

18:05.617 --> 18:07.868
Stan Smith's famous dinner,
cooked chicken.

18:08.035 --> 18:10.871
- I am starved.
- Use the mitts. It's hot.

18:11.038 --> 18:14.291
Stan, I'm an alien.
My skin is naturally...

18:14.458 --> 18:17.837
Damn it, Roger. I warned you.
You should have listened. I told you...

18:18.003 --> 18:21.840
You're right. You were totally right.
Curse my damnable pride.

18:22.006 --> 18:25.135
Wait. I was just about to say,
"I told you so"...

18:25.301 --> 18:30.098
...but you completely disarmed me
with a simple admission of your error.

18:30.265 --> 18:32.642
A pre-emptive strike. Of course.

18:32.809 --> 18:34.310
- Where are you going?
- India.

18:34.477 --> 18:37.980
India? But what are we supposed to do
for food?

18:43.527 --> 18:46.446
A girl at the bank told me
about this place.

18:48.739 --> 18:51.075
Okay, children, pay attention...

18:51.242 --> 18:53.703
...because you need to learn English
to survive.

18:53.870 --> 18:58.541
Repeat after me: Thank you for calling
Apple tech support.

18:58.749 --> 19:00.960
Thank you for calling
Apple tech support.

19:02.794 --> 19:08.884
There's the bell. I'll see all of you
who don't die of cholera, tomorrow at 8.

19:15.724 --> 19:17.975
Francine, I finally found you.

19:18.142 --> 19:21.312
- Stan, what are you doing here?
- I've come to take you home.

19:21.478 --> 19:23.355
This is my home now, Stan.

19:23.522 --> 19:28.193
I've found redemption here by devoting
my life to the neediest of the needy.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.486
This is my son, Sanget.

19:30.653 --> 19:35.116
I adopted him after his mother died
while toiling to feed her family.

19:35.283 --> 19:41.289
Her final wish was that I would take care
of her poor, orphaned child.

19:42.707 --> 19:45.334
You don't understand.
I was wrong and you were right...

19:45.500 --> 19:48.920
...about that blind date. Terrible.
Bullock ended up killing Melinda...

19:49.087 --> 19:52.674
...so I framed you because I didn't
wanna hear you say, "I told you so."

19:52.841 --> 19:53.925
What?

19:54.092 --> 19:57.012
I've admitted I was wrong.
I took the wind out of your sails.

19:57.178 --> 19:59.388
So come on, let's go home.
All is forgiven.

19:59.555 --> 20:01.057
You bastard!

20:04.602 --> 20:07.980
Oh, God. It's like being in a sauna
with Michael Chiklis.

20:08.147 --> 20:10.815
You made me think I was a murderer?

20:10.982 --> 20:15.028
Do you have any idea what a nightmare
you put me through?

20:15.195 --> 20:18.073
I prayed to a fricking elephant!

20:18.239 --> 20:21.117
How am I gonna explain that to Jesus?

20:21.284 --> 20:23.286
I'm sorry.

20:23.453 --> 20:25.371
You are sorry?

20:25.537 --> 20:29.166
Do you know
what super-diarrhea is, Stan?

20:29.333 --> 20:33.087
Do you know how much
you screwed up my life?

20:33.253 --> 20:35.881
I know I've done some terrible things,
but I'll fix it.

20:36.048 --> 20:37.758
I'll fix it everything, I swear.

20:37.925 --> 20:40.927
What about Sanget?
I don't want an Indian baby.

20:41.094 --> 20:45.556
I don't even like Indian food.
What are you gonna do to fix this?

20:51.354 --> 20:53.772
We won't have to worry about
that baby any more.

20:53.939 --> 20:57.275
That's right. Now you've cleared
the brush, we can build a sandbox...

20:57.442 --> 21:00.278
...where Avery Jr. Can play safely.

21:00.445 --> 21:02.781
We won't be working
any more late nights, sir?

21:02.948 --> 21:06.492
I don't know about you, Smith, but
some of us have families to go home to.

21:06.659 --> 21:09.537
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.498
- I'm pretty eager to get home myself.
- Don't touch me.

21:12.665 --> 21:14.834
- Still not there yet?
- Not even close.

21:50.908 --> 21:52.994
