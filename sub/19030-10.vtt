WEBVTT

00:02.306 --> 00:04.580
Okay, mr. Rego, I know
you've been complaining

00:04.615 --> 00:06.455
About the bedpans being
too cold, so I used

00:06.490 --> 00:10.372
An incubator in pediatrics to
warm this bad boy up for you.

00:10.407 --> 00:12.011
Enjoy.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.054
You know, I used
to use an incubator

00:14.088 --> 00:17.233
To keep my lunch warm
till some whiny new mom

00:17.268 --> 00:19.844
Complained that her preemie
smelled like a ham sandwich.

00:19.878 --> 00:22.522
Weird thing was, I had
a tuna melt in there, not ham.

00:22.557 --> 00:24.162
Most newborns smell amazing.

00:24.197 --> 00:27.375
An unlucky few
are ham babies.

00:27.410 --> 00:31.158
Oh, god. Here comes the happiest
person on the planet.

00:31.192 --> 00:35.543
Hi! Oh, hey, oh, you look
so beautiful today.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.255
Hi! Oh, hi, katie!

00:38.289 --> 00:42.539
All the interns are going out
for drinks. You want to come?
Yeah. I'll get my stuff.

00:42.573 --> 00:44.346
How about you,
dude chick?

00:44.381 --> 00:46.857
Nah, I'm gonna stay here
and catch up on my scut work.

00:46.891 --> 00:49.969
You can try as hard as you want
not to be my friend,

00:50.003 --> 00:51.945
But eventually I'm gonna get ya.
Come on, howie.

00:51.979 --> 00:53.918
If I get drunk enough,
I'll undo my scrub bottoms

00:53.954 --> 00:55.861
And let you do
a shot off my butt.
All right.

00:55.895 --> 00:58.772
I've noticed that you
always stay here late

00:58.807 --> 01:01.283
And work after your shift
is over.
I got a lot of work.

01:01.317 --> 01:03.392
If you don't get out
of the hospital

01:03.426 --> 01:05.735
Every once in a while
and blow off some steam,

01:05.769 --> 01:08.513
This place will
eventually crush you.

01:08.548 --> 01:11.292
So go, okay? For me.
Fine.

01:11.326 --> 01:15.877
Great. Oh, my god, caitlin,
that baby's beautiful.

01:15.911 --> 01:17.483
(cooing)
(sniffs)

01:17.518 --> 01:20.495
(grunts) ham baby.
Mm.

01:20.530 --> 01:22.906
What?

01:22.940 --> 01:26.019
Oh, hell, no.

01:31.008 --> 01:34.721
Gotcha.

01:34.756 --> 01:38.336
(suspenseful music plays)
holy mackerel.

01:38.371 --> 01:41.517
Oh, my god.
This can't get any worse.

01:41.551 --> 01:44.362
That is one
long-ass booby hair.

01:46.338 --> 01:48.679
<i>(j.D.) like most hospitals,
sacred heart makes</i>

01:48.714 --> 01:51.927
<i>Their interns put on a sketch
show roasting the senior staff.</i>

01:51.961 --> 01:55.676
<i>It was never any good,
but this year it would be.</i>

01:55.710 --> 01:57.817
Okay, people,
before we begin,

01:57.852 --> 02:00.697
You need to accept
one simple truth--

02:00.731 --> 02:04.478
We are funny, and you are not.
Sucks to hear, doesn't it?

02:04.514 --> 02:07.792
We will be writing all of
your sketches. You're welcome.

02:07.827 --> 02:10.102
Let's jump right in.
I need two volunteers

02:10.136 --> 02:13.483
To go full-frontal.
Howie?
No. I have eczema.

02:13.517 --> 02:16.294
Sunny, denise, maybe rubbing
some oil on one another?

02:16.328 --> 02:18.303
Yeah, sure, no problem.
No, not at all.

02:18.337 --> 02:22.420
Okay, well, then let's cut
the leukemia sketch.
Dude, no!
That sketch is gold.

02:22.454 --> 02:25.365
Well, if they're not naked,
they're just sad and dying.

02:25.399 --> 02:28.076
What's funny about that?
We make 'em british.

02:28.111 --> 02:31.858
Good save. It's back in,
but only because this man

02:31.893 --> 02:34.938
Is a comic genius.
I have been called
the black wayne brady.

02:34.973 --> 02:36.846
Okay, try
and believe in us, guys.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.088
This thing has not been funny
for eight years,

02:39.123 --> 02:40.930
When we were interns.

02:40.964 --> 02:44.143
(falsetto voice)
¶ I lovjesus ¶

02:44.177 --> 02:46.118
¶ and jesus cure me ¶

02:46.153 --> 02:49.800
¶ one, two, three, jesus! ¶

02:49.834 --> 02:52.244
I sure do love me
some jesus.

02:52.278 --> 02:53.850
I know, laverne.

02:53.885 --> 02:55.523
You rang?

02:55.558 --> 02:58.469
The messiah, ladies
and gentlemen! The messiah.

02:58.503 --> 03:00.846
Shalom and nanu nanu,
my friends.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.423
<i>Oh, hell, no!</i>

03:03.457 --> 03:05.766
Front row. (grunts)

03:05.800 --> 03:06.837
(laughter)

03:06.872 --> 03:10.084
There will be
a 20-minute intermission.

03:10.118 --> 03:13.632
I never saw her coming. She was
killed in a car accident.

03:13.666 --> 03:15.607
I miss her.

03:15.642 --> 03:18.185
Anyway, let's be funny...

03:18.219 --> 03:20.561
For her.

03:20.595 --> 03:24.276
(lazlo bane) ¶ I can't do this
all on my own ¶

03:24.311 --> 03:25.649
¶ no, I know ¶

03:25.683 --> 03:33.046
¶ I'm no superman ¶

03:34.218 --> 03:36.828
Hey, will you hand me those
blood gas reports, sonia?

03:36.862 --> 03:39.841
You can call me sunny.
My dad nicknamed me that

03:39.875 --> 03:42.184
Because he said
I brighten up a room.

03:42.219 --> 03:45.263
Of course in college,
I had a few dark years.

03:45.298 --> 03:47.974
My car was stolen.
I had three--was it three?

03:48.008 --> 03:52.360
No, four--
I had four abortions.

03:52.395 --> 03:54.234
I'm joking. (laughs)

03:54.268 --> 03:55.774
I'm gonna kill you
with a hammer.

03:55.841 --> 03:57.681
(laughs)

03:57.716 --> 03:59.724
Why are you laughing?

03:59.758 --> 04:03.338
'cause I'm scared.
I'm not that strong.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.313
So... How was last night,
denise?

04:05.347 --> 04:07.757
I ended up staying here
and finishing my casework.

04:07.791 --> 04:10.635
What the hell? I mean,
at least with my patients,

04:10.670 --> 04:12.678
I'm used to being ignored,
like mr. Cooper

04:12.712 --> 04:14.417
After his triple bypass.

04:14.452 --> 04:16.494
I told him to start
eating healthier.

04:16.528 --> 04:19.004
He goes right back to
scarfing down bacon burgers.

04:19.038 --> 04:22.048
And do you want to know
where he is now, denise?
He's dead, isn't he?

04:24.527 --> 04:27.103
I was going to say that he was
dead, but I think saying that

04:27.138 --> 04:29.949
About people who are
still alive is a huge jinx.

04:29.983 --> 04:33.129
Look, when I kicked you out
of the hospital last night...
(cell phone ringing)

04:33.163 --> 04:35.773
Please don't be mr. Cooper dead.
Please don't be mr. Cooper dead.

04:35.807 --> 04:39.019
Nope, just my mom. Ignore.
(beep)

04:39.055 --> 04:41.831
Look, I promise I'll get out
of the hospital tonight, okay?

04:41.866 --> 04:45.179
Deal. Now come on. I want
you guys both to see this case.

04:45.213 --> 04:48.024
She's a 16-year-old girl
with cyclical neutropenia.

04:48.058 --> 04:50.199
It's a rare disorder
that periodically shuts down

04:50.234 --> 04:52.275
Her entire immune system.

04:52.309 --> 04:55.689
Basically, every three weeks
she almost dies.
(cell phone beeping)

04:55.723 --> 04:57.597
Hey, briana, mrs. Tarasi.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.006
Just wanted to introduce you
to sunny and denise.

05:00.041 --> 05:02.919
They're the interns who'll be
covering the floor today.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.228
Oh, cool. If you guys give me
your cell numbers,

05:05.263 --> 05:09.044
I can text you
if I need anything?
These kids with their texting
and their cell phones.

05:09.079 --> 05:11.755
Our geration
never had that stuff.
Yeah.

05:11.790 --> 05:13.797
I just kind of feel like,
I don't know,

05:13.832 --> 05:17.580
There's three generations
in the room right now.

05:17.614 --> 05:19.554
If you want
to instant message me,

05:19.589 --> 05:22.032
My screen name is
sunnyhoneybunny.
Of course it is.

05:22.066 --> 05:26.818
Do you have teenagers?
How old do you think I am?

05:26.852 --> 05:28.291
What's up?

05:28.325 --> 05:30.199
Where have you been?
Oh.

05:30.233 --> 05:32.776
How could you be late?!
(grunts)

05:32.811 --> 05:36.525
This is our sketch show! Our
sketch show! Our sketch show!
(grunts and screams)

05:36.560 --> 05:38.667
That's cool, man.
It's just a sketch show.

05:38.702 --> 05:40.743
<i>Our sketch show!</i>

05:40.777 --> 05:45.026
Okay, let's assign sketches.
Partner up, please.

05:47.338 --> 05:49.713
(door closes)
yikes. Um...

05:49.747 --> 05:52.357
I'll be with denise.
Problem solved.

05:52.392 --> 05:55.905
Yay. Can we go now?

05:55.940 --> 05:57.679
Good morning.

05:57.713 --> 06:00.826
Okay, I think we should just
get this out in the open.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.943
I saw you pluck your...
Special hair the other day.

06:04.977 --> 06:07.956
(imitates springing noises)

06:07.990 --> 06:11.570
Boing, boing.
(imitates violin playing)

06:11.605 --> 06:13.345
I was there. I saw.

06:13.379 --> 06:15.989
The question is,
what are we gonna do about it?

06:16.023 --> 06:18.299
I have an idea. Let me
speak first. May I? Good.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.876
I believe that you should
give me the hair,

06:20.911 --> 06:23.720
Because I've been scrapbooking
the most disgusting things

06:23.755 --> 06:26.197
That I can think of,
and I want to put it

06:26.232 --> 06:29.143
On the page in between
my decayed molars and my snug,

06:29.177 --> 06:31.486
Which is a snail/slug hybrid
that I was able

06:31.521 --> 06:34.834
To splice together
in my garage unsuccessfully.

06:34.868 --> 06:38.248
We didn't see
each other yesterday.

06:39.990 --> 06:41.896
Well, that was unexpected.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.649
Thank you. Okay, briana,
your chest x-ray looks good.

06:46.683 --> 06:49.327
We should be able
to get you home tomorrow.

06:49.361 --> 06:51.736
I'm just gonna go talk
to your mom

06:51.772 --> 06:53.880
About some changes
in your medication.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.352
Aren't moms the greatest?

06:55.386 --> 06:58.666
My mom bought me these scrubs
last week just because.

06:58.701 --> 07:00.708
Oh, and this morning
I found this little note.

07:00.742 --> 07:03.385
It says,
"you're super special."

07:03.419 --> 07:06.599
If that's what moms do,
I'm glad I never met mine.

07:06.633 --> 07:09.611
(chuckles) "look at me.
I'm dark and edgy."

07:09.645 --> 07:12.390
I love my mom, but I wish
she would ease up a little.

07:12.424 --> 07:15.235
I mean, I know I'm sick,
but not all the time,

07:15.269 --> 07:17.879
And she still never
lets me leave the house.

07:17.914 --> 07:20.356
You know,
I've never had a date.

07:20.390 --> 07:22.498
It's like she's
so freaked out about me dying

07:22.533 --> 07:24.908
That she won't
let me have a life.

07:24.942 --> 07:28.355
She doesn't want
your stupid note.
(whispers)
you don't know that.

07:30.301 --> 07:32.074
Do I know you?

07:32.109 --> 07:33.715
I'm a friend.

07:33.749 --> 07:37.095
What is jimmy the overly
touchy ordly doing here?

07:37.129 --> 07:39.605
Dude, he does amazing
impressions. He's a ringer.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.183
We could put him in any bit
that's not working,

07:42.217 --> 07:44.091
Like the dr. Wen sketch.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.802
(claps)
it's almost showtime. Let's
work out some of the kinks.

07:46.837 --> 07:48.643
You guys doing
the dr. Cox sketch,

07:48.678 --> 07:53.094
<i>Make sure you really</i>

07:53.129 --> 07:55.371
Stretch out
all your words, okay?

07:55.406 --> 07:58.015
And under no circumstances
are you to tell him that

07:58.050 --> 08:00.592
I wrote the joke implying
he may have a sports car

08:00.627 --> 08:03.404
Because he has a small penis--
unless he finds it hilarious,

08:03.439 --> 08:05.245
At which point,
you will break character

08:05.280 --> 08:08.726
And say, "john dorian
wrote that joke."

08:08.761 --> 08:11.973
I will then stand,
give a humble nod like so

08:12.007 --> 08:13.747
And then gesture
for you to continue.

08:13.782 --> 08:15.689
Meghan,
you're playing carla.

08:15.723 --> 08:17.798
That's my wife.
Please show some respect.

08:17.832 --> 08:20.274
Kathy,
you're playing elliot,

08:20.309 --> 08:23.622
So I want to see some bug eyes,
all right? And--perfect.

08:23.656 --> 08:25.563
Plus find some cardboard.

08:25.597 --> 08:28.040
Stick it down the back
of your pants, right?

08:28.074 --> 08:29.847
Make that ass flat, girl. Let me
see what you got right now.

08:29.881 --> 08:32.323
Yeah, we can go flatter.
We can go flatter.

08:32.357 --> 08:34.934
We can go flatter!
You know what?
I've chewed on that thing,

08:34.969 --> 08:37.948
And it's flatter
than day-old beer.
I gotta tell ya.

08:37.982 --> 08:40.861
You know what? I made a funny.
Turk, rewrite.
¶ I am already on it ¶

08:40.895 --> 08:44.943
Katie, dynamite
beardfacé costume.
I can't see anything in this.

08:44.978 --> 08:48.324
Performers find a way, katie.
Use your other senses.

08:48.359 --> 08:50.700
(j.D.) where are
sunny and denise?

08:50.735 --> 08:54.148
Well, you know, they're supposed
to be--no, thank you. Cool.

08:54.182 --> 08:56.190
They're supposed
to be playing us,

08:56.225 --> 08:58.634
But they haven't picked up
their scripts or anything.

08:58.669 --> 09:01.378
Hey, dr. Reid, could we talk
to you about briana?

09:01.413 --> 09:03.353
Her mom is being
way too overprotective.

09:03.387 --> 09:05.998
Unfortunately, milady,
I saw what I saw.

09:06.032 --> 09:10.282
You either plucked a giant hair,
or you have mini chest snakes.

09:10.316 --> 09:12.223
Maybe you're
just imagining things,

09:12.257 --> 09:14.634
Like that time you thought
you'd built a giant sand castle

09:14.668 --> 09:18.315
In the parking lot, or the time
you said you hung j.D. Up

09:18.349 --> 09:21.395
Like a flag, totally defying
the laws of physics.
I did those things.

09:21.429 --> 09:23.436
Did you?

09:23.470 --> 09:26.717
At least I thought I--head games
aren't gonna work on me.

09:26.751 --> 09:29.494
Unfortunately for you,
I have a photographic memory.

09:29.529 --> 09:32.474
For instance, I arrived
here yesterday at 7:45 a.M.

09:32.508 --> 09:34.449
At 7:50 a.M., I took a nap.
At 2:45 p.M.,

09:34.483 --> 09:37.361
I awoke to find you plucking
a comically large hair

09:37.395 --> 09:39.603
Off of your baby feeder.

09:39.637 --> 09:42.214
I then took my afternoon nap,
then I went on break,

09:42.248 --> 09:45.696
And then I went home. Couldn't
sleep a wink. Damndest thing.

09:45.730 --> 09:47.168
Sad.

09:47.202 --> 09:49.645
Stop walking away from me.

09:49.679 --> 09:54.063
And now I'm sleepy again.
(mutters)

09:54.098 --> 09:56.172
Briana should totally
get to live her life.

09:56.206 --> 09:58.817
I'm gonna go talk to her mom.
But you guys gotta

09:58.851 --> 10:01.360
Do me a favor. She's really
starting to get in my head

10:01.395 --> 10:03.369
With this whole
"we're the same age" thing.

10:03.404 --> 10:05.310
So I'm just gonna start
throwing out numbers,

10:05.344 --> 10:07.787
And you gu stop me
whenever I get to the age

10:07.821 --> 10:10.665
You think I look like, okay?
22, 23, 24, 25, 25, 25.

10:10.701 --> 10:14.046
You know what? This is
a really stupid game, okay?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.022
Aren't you guys late
for some sketch show?
Crap.

10:16.056 --> 10:17.594
(sighs) idiots.

10:17.629 --> 10:20.439
Isn't this fun,
running together?

10:20.474 --> 10:23.117
Shut up, sunny!
Okay.

10:25.628 --> 10:28.038
Oh, my god. I'm so nervous.
Welcome to live theater.

10:28.072 --> 10:29.175
Mm-hmm.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.515
(light applause)

10:30.549 --> 10:35.501
(imitating kelso) I'm bob kelso,
and my life is so empty

10:35.536 --> 10:37.812
That I still
come here every day

10:37.846 --> 10:41.861
To stuff my face with muffins.
And I like prostitutes.

10:41.896 --> 10:43.000
(laughter)

10:43.034 --> 10:46.715
(laughs) that's funny
'cause it's true.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.590
(applause)

10:48.624 --> 10:51.302
(imitating todd)
hey, I'm the todd.

10:51.336 --> 10:54.012
Wow, looks like we got
a full house.

10:54.047 --> 10:56.624
I got a full house
in my pants. Boom!

10:56.658 --> 10:58.799
(laughing)

10:58.833 --> 11:02.280
(imitating british accent)
hello, I'm dr. Beardface.

11:02.314 --> 11:04.522
I was up all night sewing.

11:04.557 --> 11:06.765
My beard is only this big.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.911
Lighten up, seymour.
I took my lumps.

11:09.946 --> 11:13.159
Okay, one last chance to admit
the truth before this gets ugly.

11:13.193 --> 11:16.070
Did I see the nurple hair
or not?
You did not.

11:16.104 --> 11:18.782
(katie) beardface!
Mm. And so it begins.

11:18.816 --> 11:21.828
(imitating dr. Wen) hi.
I'm dr. Wen, and it's an honor

11:21.862 --> 11:24.237
To have you as a patient,
owen wilson.

11:24.272 --> 11:26.212
(imitating owen wilson)
oh, come on, doc.

11:26.246 --> 11:28.087
What about patient/doctor
privacy, huh?

11:28.122 --> 11:30.061
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

11:30.096 --> 11:32.638
Mr. Jack black.
(imitating jack black)
thanks, buddy!

11:32.674 --> 11:34.681
¶ sacred heart ¶

11:34.716 --> 11:37.894
(sings indistinctly)

11:37.928 --> 11:39.242
Mr. Brad pitt.
thank you, dr. Wen.

11:39.876 --> 11:42.754
I do have to say, it's very hard
covering the medical bill

11:42.788 --> 11:46.503
When you have 14 children,
ha ha! (grunts)

11:46.537 --> 11:48.779
(imitating dane cook) you know,
you know, people are

11:48.813 --> 11:50.218
Always asking me, "hey, hey,
dane cook, hey, dane cook"--

11:50.253 --> 11:53.499
Yeah, they use my full name--
"hey, what's the deal

11:53.534 --> 11:55.440
"with tong depressors, huh?
Is it supposed to make

11:55.474 --> 11:57.682
Your tongue sad or something?"
like, taste it--

11:57.717 --> 12:00.226
"oh, this muffin tastes sad."
why do people find me funny?
(man clears throat)

12:00.260 --> 12:02.034
Dude, we gave 'em
too much jimmy.

12:02.068 --> 12:04.243
(j.D.) off the stage, jimmy!

12:04.277 --> 12:06.854
Okay, jimmy. Yay.

12:06.888 --> 12:08.595
Hi, everyone.

12:08.629 --> 12:12.779
We're gonna do a sketch
about dr. Dorian and dr. Turk.

12:12.813 --> 12:16.828
I don't even know what
we're supposed to do.
Just follow my lead.

12:16.863 --> 12:19.172
(whispers) okay.
(laughter)

12:19.206 --> 12:21.782
<i>Look at your mole.
It's huge.</i>

12:21.817 --> 12:24.293
Here are those lab reports
you wanted, turk.

12:24.327 --> 12:27.775
Thanks.
I did need those, j.D.

12:27.809 --> 12:30.218
(j.D.) they're bombing.
(turk) mm, serves them right.

12:30.252 --> 12:32.560
Yeah, who cares about them?
We did it!

12:32.596 --> 12:35.908
We did the whole thing.
Good-bye, j.D.
Thank you so much for ev--

12:35.942 --> 12:39.088
Shh.
(audience gasps)

12:40.695 --> 12:43.138
How is that funny?

12:43.173 --> 12:45.882
(laughing)

12:45.917 --> 12:49.465
(cheering and whistling)

12:49.499 --> 12:51.271
Hey, dr. Reid,

12:51.306 --> 12:54.351
Did you get a chance
to talk to briana's mom?

12:54.385 --> 12:56.226
Well, I'll tell you--

12:56.260 --> 12:59.204
Hey, denise, we're all going out
for drinks to celebrate.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.782
You want to come?
No, I'm gonna stay and study.

13:01.817 --> 13:06.267
And you broke your promise
yet again. Shocking.
Look, I promise I'll go out
tomorrow night, okay?

13:06.301 --> 13:09.481
So what did briana's mom say?
You know, I've been
thinking about it.

13:09.515 --> 13:12.459
Okay, we have really no idea
what that woman's going through.

13:12.494 --> 13:15.305
I mean, who's to say that she
isn't right to be so cautious?

13:15.339 --> 13:17.112
After all,
it's her daughter.

13:17.147 --> 13:19.054
So I decided
not to talk to her.

13:19.088 --> 13:22.267
It's really
none of our business.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.979
(cell phone beeps)

13:26.000 --> 13:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:35.523 --> 13:38.166
<i>Today was the fifth anniversary
of the time turk and I</i>

13:38.200 --> 13:40.175
<i>Met david caruso
on a ferris wheel.</i>

13:40.209 --> 13:42.584
<i>Usually to celebrate,
turk would lift me in the air</i>

13:42.620 --> 13:45.363
<i>While I straddled him
and yelled, "eagle!"</i>

13:45.397 --> 13:48.711
<i>But this morning I somehow knew
that wasn't gonna happen.</i>

13:48.745 --> 13:50.651
Hey.
Hey.

13:50.685 --> 13:55.070
<i>Eagle! Elliot didn't seem
like herself either.</i>

13:55.105 --> 13:58.082
I don't care what you think
is right for briana, okay?

13:58.117 --> 14:00.225
If either one of you
hassles her mom,

14:00.259 --> 14:02.634
There will be consequences--
bad ones.

14:02.669 --> 14:05.881
Okay, why are you smiling?

14:05.915 --> 14:09.563
I can't help it.
It's permanent.

14:09.597 --> 14:12.709
Donny, muffin, please?

14:12.744 --> 14:14.384
Not bran.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.592
Better.

14:16.627 --> 14:17.831
What do you want?

14:17.865 --> 14:20.073
I'm gettin' ready to torture
nurse chest whiskers.

14:20.108 --> 14:22.082
But it's her word
against mine,

14:22.117 --> 14:26.065
So I need you to verify
yesterday's incident.
What incident?
I wasn't even here yesterday.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.107
You were there.

14:28.142 --> 14:30.852
Excuse me. What? Shh. (whispers)
he's standing right here.

14:30.887 --> 14:33.730
(whispers) me?
(normal voice)
okay, I'll tell him.

14:33.764 --> 14:38.081
My muffin thinks you're crazy,
and she wants you to go.

14:38.116 --> 14:39.889
(normal voice)
you tell your muffin

14:39.924 --> 14:41.864
<i>That I think she's crazy.
Maybe she should go.</i>

14:41.898 --> 14:43.136
No.

14:43.170 --> 14:46.048
What is happening to me?

14:50.266 --> 14:51.906
Nice job.

14:51.940 --> 14:55.722
(denise) that lady has no idea
what's good for her daughter.

14:55.756 --> 14:59.202
I know. I just want to go
over there and smush her face.

14:59.236 --> 15:03.822
<i>So this is you mad?
Did you hear me?
I'd like to smush it!</i>

15:03.857 --> 15:05.629
So go talk to her.

15:05.664 --> 15:08.340
I mean, you're both
sort-of-almost doctors.

15:08.374 --> 15:11.320
Part of that is doing
what you think is right.

15:11.354 --> 15:15.337
Let's do this.
Okay, try to act tough.
And forget it.

15:17.244 --> 15:20.090
Oh, so now we can't sit
on the same side of the table?

15:20.124 --> 15:23.068
We always do up here.

15:23.103 --> 15:25.211
Why did that sketch
bother us so much?

15:25.245 --> 15:28.390
We've always joked
about our little--
don't say it, okay?
I hate that word.

15:28.424 --> 15:30.933
It's a bromance, turk.
You can't fight it.

15:30.968 --> 15:33.612
It never bothered me before
because I thought it was

15:33.646 --> 15:36.558
Our stupid little joke that
elliot and carla were in on,

15:36.592 --> 15:38.398
But I didn't know that's how

15:38.433 --> 15:40.507
The whole hospital
views us, man.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.247
J.D.?

15:42.282 --> 15:44.424
Pretty great, huh?

15:44.459 --> 15:46.466
Well, when you're right,
you're right.
Yeah.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.640
So how's your day going?
It's pretty good so far.

15:48.675 --> 15:51.386
Mm-hmm.
I see you're eating bread again.
I thought you were off carbs.

15:51.420 --> 15:54.365
J.D.!
I-I'm sorry. I'm back.
Continue.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.009
We're senior staff now, so...

15:57.043 --> 16:00.289
Maybe at work we should
tone down the p.D.A.

16:00.323 --> 16:02.833
I agree.
But does that include--

16:02.867 --> 16:04.842
It definitely
includes "eagle."

16:04.876 --> 16:07.185
Oh. Good.

16:07.219 --> 16:10.063
Oh, look at that.
I'm not hungry anymore.

16:10.098 --> 16:13.779
Briana has so much
to deal with right now.

16:13.813 --> 16:16.356
Just seems like you should let
her enjoy every normal moment

16:16.390 --> 16:18.967
She can instead of forcing her
to hide from life all the time.

16:19.001 --> 16:23.352
As much as I hate to agree
with dr...
Dey.

16:23.386 --> 16:25.594
Your name is sunny day?
Mm-hmm.

16:25.629 --> 16:28.004
Okay, as ridiculous
as it was for her parents

16:28.038 --> 16:30.782
To name her that, I think
what you're doing with briana

16:30.816 --> 16:34.565
Is a thousand times worse.
My daughter's immune system
doesn't work.

16:34.599 --> 16:37.243
Why don't you two tell me
what it's like when your child

16:37.277 --> 16:39.251
Risks death
every time she shakes hand

16:39.285 --> 16:42.431
Do you think I care one bit
what you think?

16:42.465 --> 16:45.008
We tried.

16:45.042 --> 16:47.351
You know, yesterday dr. Reid
came in and gave me

16:47.386 --> 16:50.632
The same sanctimonious speech,
and I told her

16:50.666 --> 16:54.749
The exact same thing.
Hey, what's going on over here?

16:54.783 --> 16:57.191
Everything okay?

16:57.226 --> 17:00.607
I'm great. I just don't know
what's real anymore.

17:00.641 --> 17:03.050
But that's okay, right?

17:03.084 --> 17:05.259
I mean, so what
if big chunks of my life

17:05.292 --> 17:07.535
Were just figments
of my imagination?

17:07.569 --> 17:10.681
So I never went to china
and had a baby with a local.

17:10.717 --> 17:12.924
Maybe I was never

17:12.958 --> 17:14.732
In "the fugitive."

17:14.766 --> 17:17.810
Listen, this place
can make anyone crazy.

17:17.846 --> 17:19.853
Mm.
Once, after a double shift,

17:19.887 --> 17:22.296
I swore I went home
and crawled into bed with turk.

17:22.330 --> 17:24.304
Next day, I woke up
in the on call room

17:24.339 --> 17:26.513
Spooning dr. Beardface.

17:26.548 --> 17:29.694
Now the guys' always
slipping me hotel keys.
(laughs)

17:29.728 --> 17:31.635
Can't believe you're
being so nice to me

17:31.669 --> 17:33.610
When I almost punished you
for something

17:33.645 --> 17:37.225
That never even happened.
Please accept my apologies.

17:40.238 --> 17:44.120
That was easier than I thought.

17:44.154 --> 17:46.563
No, beardface.

17:48.439 --> 17:50.346
I'm so proud of you, man.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.589
You know,
I've always emulated you.

17:52.624 --> 17:55.600
I shave my privates bald
to look like your head.

17:55.636 --> 17:58.011
Todd, I'm actually
kind of touched.

17:58.045 --> 18:00.588
Come on.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.832
What's going on?

18:02.866 --> 18:06.413
<i>They're gonna publish
my old therapy paper.
There it was.</i>

18:06.447 --> 18:09.626
<i>He wanted a hug, and I damn
sure wanted to give him one.</i>

18:09.660 --> 18:12.639
<i>But all we could do
was say this...</i>

18:12.673 --> 18:14.078
Congrats.

18:14.112 --> 18:16.152
Thanks, man.

18:16.188 --> 18:19.132
<i>Don't look back.
Fight it. Fight it.</i>

18:19.167 --> 18:21.107
<i>Damn it, you're only human.</i>

18:21.141 --> 18:22.781
(voice echoes) turk!

18:24.288 --> 18:27.668
(panting) I ran
all the way around.

18:27.702 --> 18:31.316
(j.D. And turk)
¶ it's guy love ¶
people are gonna look.

18:31.350 --> 18:33.693
What people?
¶ it's guy love,
it's real to guys ¶

18:33.727 --> 18:35.701
(turk) oh!

18:35.736 --> 18:39.784
(slaps back)

18:41.627 --> 18:44.605
Why'd you lie about
talking to briana's mom?

18:44.640 --> 18:46.981
Uh, I'm going first.
Why did you go talk to her

18:47.016 --> 18:50.160
After I told you to drop it?
It's not fair
what her mom's doing.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.600
And why is that?

18:51.634 --> 18:53.709
I don't know.
Because people need to be able

18:53.743 --> 18:58.026
To go out and do things
and live life.
Where have I heard
that before? Oh, yeah,

18:58.062 --> 19:00.169
It's the exact same advice
I've given you 9,000 times.

19:00.203 --> 19:03.148
So you had me get crushed by
that mom just to prove a point?

19:03.183 --> 19:05.256
She even had me
give you a little push

19:05.291 --> 19:08.939
So you wouldn't wimp out.
I'm very bright.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.316
Look, I've been there.
I did what you did.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.260
I was an intern.
I've lived at this hospital.

19:14.295 --> 19:16.704
I saw the same exact people
day after day,

19:16.738 --> 19:19.650
Which, for the record, makes
even the uggos look attractive

19:19.684 --> 19:23.130
<i>After a while.
Oh, is that how you got
together with dr, dorian?</i>

19:23.165 --> 19:26.244
What? No!
Well, maybe at first. No.

19:26.279 --> 19:30.428
<i>No.
Sometimes interns
think they know it all,</i>

19:30.463 --> 19:33.139
<i>But the lessons really
never stop coming.</i>

19:33.173 --> 19:35.750
<i>Whether you've heard it
a thousand times...</i>

19:35.784 --> 19:38.227
For the last time, get out
of here every once in a while,

19:38.261 --> 19:40.202
Or this place
will swallow you up.

19:40.237 --> 19:43.716
<i>What about briana?
Or it's something totally new.</i>

19:43.751 --> 19:46.695
So much crappy stuff
happens here all day long.

19:46.730 --> 19:49.306
The best way to get past it
is do what I do.

19:49.341 --> 19:51.918
Just pretend
it never happened.

19:51.952 --> 19:54.428
¶

19:54.462 --> 19:56.904
Hey, sorry again.

19:56.940 --> 20:00.184
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

20:00.219 --> 20:03.197
<i>Of course, some lessons
you pick up on your own...</i>

20:03.232 --> 20:05.741
I just got the urge
to buy you a shirt.

20:05.775 --> 20:08.318
Well, then, to the mall!

20:08.354 --> 20:10.092
Mount up. Yeah!

20:10.127 --> 20:12.469
Eagle!

20:12.503 --> 20:16.586
<i>(laughing)
like how important it is
to have a good friend here</i>

20:16.620 --> 20:18.628
<i>To help you get through it.</i>

20:18.663 --> 20:19.732
Oh!

20:19.768 --> 20:23.783
Anyone sitting here?
Not just anyone--you.

20:23.817 --> 20:28.201
Okay, no more talking
until I'm drunk, okay?

20:28.235 --> 20:36.870
(speaks indistinctly)

20:37.742 --> 20:37.807
(beep)
partner up, please.

20:40.018 --> 20:42.326
Val, please don't make a sign
that says "loser"

20:42.395 --> 20:44.334
With an arrow pointing
towards jo.

20:44.403 --> 20:46.844
Ha ha, now it's--
now it's pointing towards me.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.422
Very clever. Turk, will you
get the sign, please?

20:49.490 --> 20:52.468
I am on it. Val!
You guys are doctors.

20:52.537 --> 20:54.577
I'm tellin' you!
This is unprofessional.

20:54.645 --> 20:55.949
Got it.

20:56.017 --> 20:58.258
(beep)
this is
a different "loser" sign.

20:58.326 --> 21:01.305
Where is the original
"loser" sign? There's two now.
Ght there.

21:01.373 --> 21:04.385
I see it. I see it. I know.
I'm gonna get it right now.
Well, okay. Can you get
that one, please?

21:04.452 --> 21:06.795
I think we should
stop looking for the sign

21:06.863 --> 21:08.803
And start looking
for the sharpie,

21:08.871 --> 21:12.050
'cause we're
losing control here.
We are not losing control.
Okay, who wrote that?
