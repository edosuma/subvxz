P. A.: Attention.
Attention, please.

00:21.079 --> 00:23.576
Continental Airlines
announces the departure...

00:23.640 --> 00:27.736
of flight three for Los Angeles
and Honolulu at gate 28-

00:27.799 --> 00:29.208
the blue concourse.

03:09.529 --> 03:11.417
Global 45, Lincoln Tower.
Clear to land.

03:11.481 --> 03:14.617
Runway two-niner.
Wind: 15, gusting 25.

03:14.682 --> 03:17.369
Roger. Cleared to land.
Runway in sight.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.858
Lincoln Tower from Global 45.

04:20.922 --> 04:23.898
We cut the taxiway short.
We're stuck in the snow.

04:23.962 --> 04:26.586
Please notify company dispatch.
We'll need assistance.

04:30.011 --> 04:34.330
We've got a condition four
on two-niner at taxiway Echo.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.562
Change traffic to runway 22.
Two-niner's closed.

04:37.658 --> 04:40.538
Trans World 729, a change.
Taxi to runway 22.

04:40.602 --> 04:42.170
Runway two-niner is closed.

04:46.746 --> 04:49.338
Air Canada ninety-niner,
hold short of taxiway Bravo.

04:49.403 --> 04:51.386
Emergency equipment
will pass to your left.

05:03.899 --> 05:06.427
Runway two-niner closed
account of disabled aircraft.

05:06.459 --> 05:08.859
22. Approach.
Runway two-niner is closed.

05:08.923 --> 05:10.843
We'll stay with 22
with everything.

05:13.338 --> 05:15.450
Global 10, clear for takeoff.

05:27.899 --> 05:30.939
For this food
and your bounteous goodness,

05:31.003 --> 05:34.619
we give thanks to thee
in the name of-Jesus Christ!

05:36.379 --> 05:39.259
Mel, I'm glad I caught you
before you got away.

05:39.323 --> 05:42.299
Yeah. We just lost
runway two-niner.

05:42.363 --> 05:44.891
Tail's sticking out
on the runway 20 yards.

05:45.883 --> 05:48.220
I don't know.
Could be a long time.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.691
I'll go out there.

06:20.283 --> 06:21.532
Bakersfeld.

06:21.628 --> 06:23.740
Mel, Tanya.
How about some coffee?

06:23.804 --> 06:26.299
-I just found something.
-I just lost something.

06:26.364 --> 06:27.740
Runway two-niner.

06:27.803 --> 06:29.820
Oh, no. Snow?

06:29.884 --> 06:32.540
One of your jockeys missed
a turnoff, buried the wheel.

06:32.603 --> 06:33.979
No one told us.

06:34.044 --> 06:36.380
It just happened.
I'm on my way.

06:36.443 --> 06:37.500
Any casualties?

06:37.563 --> 06:38.619
Just me.

06:38.684 --> 06:41.340
There's bound to be
a $50 wrenched back.

06:41.403 --> 06:43.419
I'd better bring
some release forms...

06:43.483 --> 06:45.339
and plenty of sympathy
and understanding.

06:45.404 --> 06:48.092
-May I ride with you?
-See you downstairs.

06:59.643 --> 07:02.684
P. A.: Mr. Bakersfeld,
white phone. Urgent.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.540
Bakersfeld.

07:04.603 --> 07:06.140
Where the hell are you?

07:06.204 --> 07:08.220
We've got an emergency
on the field.

07:08.284 --> 07:10.619
You said you'd be home at 6:00.

07:10.684 --> 07:14.300
You promised me a week ago
you wouldn't miss this dinner.

07:14.364 --> 07:17.500
I didn't know we'd have
the worst storm in six years.

07:17.565 --> 07:20.060
You've always got
some damn excuse.

07:20.124 --> 07:21.372
I'll call you back.

08:06.045 --> 08:09.501
Let me take that, ma'am.
You'll be warmer in the bus.

08:09.596 --> 08:11.068
I'm sorry this happened.

08:11.132 --> 08:14.012
Captain wants
to take off all the weight,

08:14.109 --> 08:16.509
hook the nose gear,
and tow it out.

08:16.573 --> 08:19.261
The nose gear would never
stand the strain.

08:19.357 --> 08:20.861
That's what I said.

08:20.956 --> 08:23.420
Maybe use pneumatic bags
and lift the wings.

08:23.516 --> 08:24.701
Could take until tomorrow.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.461
I want it cleared tonight.

08:26.557 --> 08:27.581
Tonight?

08:27.676 --> 08:29.501
Look, I know you're trying,

08:29.597 --> 08:33.181
but if I can get Patroni
from TA, will you object?

08:33.275 --> 08:35.900
Joe can have
all the tries he wants.

08:35.996 --> 08:38.077
Mr. Bakersfeld!
Yes?

08:38.140 --> 08:39.549
Snow desk!

08:45.278 --> 08:47.261
-Yes, Danny?
-I'm calling Patroni.

08:47.358 --> 08:49.693
-Stand by on mobile phone.
-Roger.

09:01.437 --> 09:03.581
-Hello, Joe.
-Hi, Mel.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.941
Danny gave me the poop.
Tonight I am not available.

09:07.037 --> 09:11.101
Joe, I got 14 on the ground
and 18 stacked upstairs.

09:11.197 --> 09:15.101
I've got 5 kids at my mother's
so me and Marie could be alone.

09:15.198 --> 09:18.621
Tell Marie I'm sorry,
but I need two-niner badly.

09:18.717 --> 09:20.381
Can't Global handle it?

09:20.477 --> 09:22.622
They're deciding now
what to do,

09:22.718 --> 09:25.981
but I need somebody who knows,
a genius like Patroni.

09:26.077 --> 09:28.893
Hold the whipped cream.
I've just had dessert.

09:30.398 --> 09:33.021
-All right, I'll be there.
-Good.

09:33.117 --> 09:35.261
In the meantime,
give everybody a shovel.

09:35.358 --> 09:37.822
Start digging an incline
in front of the wheels.

09:37.918 --> 09:39.134
-Right.
-Out.

09:40.317 --> 09:41.981
Aw, Joe.

09:42.078 --> 09:44.542
Do you have to go
to work tonight?

09:44.638 --> 09:46.141
They're not called
emergencies anymore.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.221
They're called Patronis.

09:48.317 --> 09:50.494
I suppose you'll be late, huh?

09:51.518 --> 09:53.022
I'll be back in time.

09:53.118 --> 09:55.614
I'll pull that plane out
with my teeth.

10:01.054 --> 10:03.262
What's this you've found?

10:03.358 --> 10:06.622
Your brother-in-law was
on the snow clearance committee.

10:06.718 --> 10:08.222
Here's the report.

10:08.318 --> 10:11.741
It says the airport, meaning me,
has been inefficient...

10:11.839 --> 10:13.502
-in snow clearance-
-Grossly inefficient.

10:13.598 --> 10:16.062
causing flight delays,
loss of revenue to airlines,

10:16.157 --> 10:17.182
et cetera.

10:17.278 --> 10:19.518
Signed Captain Vernon Demerest,
Chairman.

10:19.582 --> 10:20.862
How can he say this?

10:20.958 --> 10:22.942
Because he's a no-good,
irresponsible louse...

10:23.038 --> 10:25.279
who'll take every opportunity
to knife me.

10:25.341 --> 10:28.221
Mobile One, snow desk.
Where are you?

10:28.318 --> 10:29.598
At the ramp.

10:29.662 --> 10:33.502
Mel, Commissioner Ackerman wants
you at the terminal. Trouble.

10:33.598 --> 10:34.878
I'm on my way.

10:34.942 --> 10:38.303
Close down runway 22.

10:38.398 --> 10:41.022
Close down runway 22.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.462
Keep moving, please.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.502
-Close down runway 22.
-Keep moving, please.

10:45.598 --> 10:48.894
Close down runway 22.

10:48.990 --> 10:52.702
They'll break it up after
the TV cameras get a few shots.

10:52.799 --> 10:53.981
TV?

10:54.079 --> 10:56.062
A lawyer arranged
for news coverage.

10:56.158 --> 10:57.663
That's all we need.

10:57.759 --> 11:00.382
I'd better get in touch
with the other commissioners.

11:00.478 --> 11:03.582
Afterwards you and I will meet
and figure something out...

11:03.679 --> 11:06.655
to calm those people down.
I'll call you.

11:08.158 --> 11:09.375
WOMel!

11:10.718 --> 11:13.663
Hi, Sis. I thought Vern
was on flight two.

11:13.758 --> 11:14.814
He is.

11:17.278 --> 11:18.623
Sure here early enough.

11:18.718 --> 11:22.143
With the weather and traffic,
Vernon didn't want to be late,

11:22.238 --> 11:24.414
but we just sailed right along.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.702
I thought they were pilots
picketing you.

11:28.798 --> 11:30.559
I was set to join them.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.662
I heard about your report.
Besides everything else,

11:33.759 --> 11:36.063
now you're an authority
on snow clearance?

11:36.159 --> 11:37.983
I call them
as I see them.

11:38.079 --> 11:39.903
You need an eye check.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.102
Clearing those runways and
taxiways is the equivalent...

11:43.198 --> 11:45.503
of 700 miles
of two-lane highway.

11:45.599 --> 11:49.822
And I'll bet you measured every
foot of it all by yourself.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.543
We've had 10 inches
of snow in 24 hours.

11:52.639 --> 11:54.782
Anchorage had twice as much,
and they're clean.

11:54.879 --> 11:56.383
They've got twice
the equipment.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.143
Then get some more.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.703
This isn't Alaska.
You don't spend $2 million...

12:00.799 --> 12:03.262
for machinery you'd use
once in 10 years.

12:03.359 --> 12:04.703
You buy for average snowfall.

12:04.799 --> 12:07.263
In an emergency,
you work around the clock.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.624
Sitting behind that desk,
you think like a bookkeeper.

12:10.719 --> 12:12.511
I didn't always fly a desk.

12:12.543 --> 12:16.543
All right, Daddy, tell me all
about when you were a war hero.

12:16.639 --> 12:19.679
You flew pursuit
and could land in a parking lot.

12:19.743 --> 12:23.423
When I'm setting down
over 200,000 pounds of 707,

12:23.519 --> 12:27.103
I want something under my wheels
that's plenty long and dry.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.823
It'll be dry tonight,
but not too long.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.072
29 is closed.

12:31.167 --> 12:35.264
The pilot from your flight made
a shortcut across the field.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.511
He didn't make it.

12:36.544 --> 12:37.760
What are you doing?

12:38.239 --> 12:41.024
When the snow melts,
we'll get it out.

12:41.119 --> 12:42.784
What do you think I'm doing?!

12:42.879 --> 12:44.832
Now, stop that, both of you!

12:44.927 --> 12:48.447
It's a waste of time arguing
with a penguin. Good-bye.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.623
Have a good flight.

12:50.719 --> 12:52.864
What should I bring you
from Rome?

12:52.960 --> 12:54.143
Just yourself.

12:54.239 --> 12:57.184
If you have time,
I could use some white gloves.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.103
Size 61/2, right?

12:59.199 --> 13:00.384
No.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.912
I'm the one who wears
size 71/2.

13:10.079 --> 13:12.384
Hey, that's a good idea, Mel-

13:12.480 --> 13:14.623
using little old ladies
for skycaps.

13:14.719 --> 13:16.767
You're doing a good job.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.967
Mel.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.728
For my sake,
be patient with him, hmm?

13:26.560 --> 13:29.984
How can you live with that
overage juvenile delinquent?

13:30.080 --> 13:33.024
If I left him,
what would I have?

13:33.120 --> 13:35.263
What if he decided to leave you?

13:35.361 --> 13:36.543
He won't.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.904
A girl gets serious, he waves
his wedding ring like a flag.

13:40.001 --> 13:41.824
I'm his disaster insurance.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.904
More like group insurance.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.504
Thanks for caring, Mel.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.903
Don't worry.
Someday he'll come home...

13:48.000 --> 13:50.944
for something other than
a change of clothes.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.064
I hope so.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.208
That's for me. Good-bye.

14:03.201 --> 14:04.288
Bakersfeld.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.848
No, no.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.184
I'll take care of it.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.968
Vern! We don't have time.

14:48.032 --> 14:51.264
I have a cab. We can make
the airport in 15 minutes.

14:51.361 --> 14:52.705
The driver will wait.

14:52.801 --> 14:54.624
His meter's running,
and so is mine.

14:54.721 --> 14:56.064
I must finish packing.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.785
Getting me up to full throttle,
then throwing me into reverse...

14:58.881 --> 15:00.481
could damage my engine.

15:00.545 --> 15:03.584
We'll be in Rome tomorrow.
We'll have three days.

15:03.681 --> 15:04.865
Try a little patience.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.368
Or a cold shower.

15:07.361 --> 15:09.185
Think about something else.

15:09.281 --> 15:11.968
That I like.
You can see right through it.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.464
Who's in the righthand seat?

15:14.561 --> 15:15.585
I am.

15:15.681 --> 15:16.866
Demoted?

15:16.961 --> 15:19.585
It's a pilot check flight.
I'm checking Anson Harris.

15:19.682 --> 15:22.466
-He's been a captain for years.
-So have I.

15:22.561 --> 15:24.385
You're checked out
every six months...

15:24.546 --> 15:27.329
to make sure you don't pick up
any bad habits.

15:29.281 --> 15:31.105
Such as nuzzling stewardesses?

15:31.201 --> 15:34.530
Mm-hmm. Does he hold on
to the control too firmly?

15:35.521 --> 15:38.786
Or can he coax them along
with just his fingers?

15:38.881 --> 15:39.969
Ohh!

15:40.801 --> 15:43.169
-We still have to-
-Go wash it.

15:43.841 --> 15:46.785
When he's stacked up
and can't get clearance to land,

15:46.882 --> 15:48.225
how does he take it?

16:10.081 --> 16:12.578
You and your roommate
have enough china, glasses,

16:12.642 --> 16:15.138
and booze for a round trip
to Australia.

16:15.202 --> 16:16.897
That's not all our loot.

16:16.962 --> 16:18.977
The girls in the building
have contributed.

16:19.042 --> 16:21.569
Grace is getting married.
We're having a party.

16:21.634 --> 16:25.058
You could hijack a 707
and start your own airline.

16:25.122 --> 16:28.258
We thought of that, but none
of us has a pilot's license.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.458
With the kind of fringe benefits
you girls can offer,

16:31.521 --> 16:34.210
I could get you a crew
right now.

16:51.042 --> 16:54.338
Mel, Joe.
I'm stuck in traffic...

16:54.402 --> 16:56.899
on Carden Road,
just east of Mannheim.

16:56.962 --> 16:59.137
A tractor trailer jackknifed.

16:59.202 --> 17:01.634
It's on its side
like a drunken dinosaur.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.778
I need two-niner awful bad.

17:03.842 --> 17:07.394
If you're not out soon,
I'll get the Highway Patrol.

17:08.641 --> 17:10.114
What else can go wrong?

17:10.210 --> 17:13.058
I better check the snow desk.
I'll be back soon.

17:13.123 --> 17:16.259
You're exhausted. You've been
rushing around for three days.

17:16.321 --> 17:18.819
-I've got to go.
-Why do everything yourself?

17:18.882 --> 17:21.377
You've got an assistant.
Let Mike do it.

17:21.442 --> 17:22.818
Sit down and relax.

17:22.883 --> 17:24.930
I'll fix you coffee
and a sandwich.

17:32.483 --> 17:35.075
Oh... one thing you should do.

17:35.682 --> 17:38.083
You promised to call
your wife back.

17:56.163 --> 17:58.019
Bakersfeld residence,
Libby speaking.

17:58.082 --> 17:59.618
This is Mr. Bakersfeld talking.

17:59.683 --> 18:02.498
Daddy! Isn't the snow super?

18:02.563 --> 18:05.219
Baby, it's cool, real cool.

18:05.282 --> 18:07.683
Robbie! Daddy's on the phone!

18:08.803 --> 18:09.859
Hello, Dad.

18:09.923 --> 18:10.979
Hi, Robbie.

18:11.043 --> 18:12.578
Are you coming home tonight?

18:12.643 --> 18:15.235
Honey, I'm not so sure.
You see, I-

18:15.331 --> 18:17.699
Say good night, girls.
Mommy wants to talk.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.851
Good night, Daddy.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.931
Good night, Dad.

18:23.363 --> 18:26.659
You hung up on me before.
Don't do that again.

18:26.722 --> 18:29.059
I'm sorry.
I was rushing to the field.

18:29.124 --> 18:31.459
All right.
We don't have time to argue.

18:31.523 --> 18:34.339
You have a dinner jacket there.
Meet me at the hotel.

18:34.403 --> 18:36.739
I can't make it.
We've got an emergency.

18:36.804 --> 18:39.138
I have to stay here
all night.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.451
You can't.

18:41.283 --> 18:43.299
You can't keep
doing this to me.

18:43.363 --> 18:45.859
Listen to me, Cindy.
In the past month,

18:45.923 --> 18:48.259
you've scheduled me
for seven charity wingdings.

18:48.323 --> 18:50.819
I've made four. That's not
a bad batting average.

18:50.883 --> 18:54.180
I'm not a ball game where
you keep score. I'm your wife.

18:54.243 --> 18:57.219
Then try to think of
my position for a change.

18:57.283 --> 18:59.939
I'm only thinking
about you.

19:00.003 --> 19:03.619
This isn't just another dinner.
Dad wants to talk to you.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.659
He's been talking and I've
been saying no for 15 years.

19:06.723 --> 19:09.219
Then why?
It's a wonderful opportunity.

19:09.284 --> 19:11.619
You two should have
gotten the message.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.859
I'm not interested
in your father's job.

19:13.924 --> 19:16.260
I've been in navigation
for 20 years.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.499
That's what I like,
and that's my life.

19:18.564 --> 19:20.419
Yes. What kind of a life?

19:20.483 --> 19:22.179
This would give you
regular hours.

19:22.243 --> 19:24.900
We could be together
and with our children.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.620
Your income would be
three times what it is.

19:27.684 --> 19:30.019
Sure. We can join
the country club.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.939
And what's wrong
with that?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.540
Let's get something
straight.

19:33.603 --> 19:37.059
I'll support my family
on the income from my job.

19:37.124 --> 19:39.652
You don't give a damn
about our future.

19:40.323 --> 19:42.372
I'm just trying
to survive the present.

19:43.203 --> 19:45.380
Well, maybe you won't have to.

19:45.444 --> 19:48.132
-What the hell does that mean?
-Figure it out.

20:04.804 --> 20:08.676
Why don't you have your coffee
in here and lie down?

20:09.764 --> 20:10.980
Guess what.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.500
They just picked up a stowaway
from L. A. on flight 86.

20:14.564 --> 20:16.036
That's four this month.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.819
BOAC had one on Monday,
a 16-year-old.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.572
If you're wondering,
we didn't have another fight.

20:22.404 --> 20:24.292
It's a continuation
of the same one.

20:26.404 --> 20:28.484
But I'm as much to blame.

20:29.444 --> 20:33.028
She's right. I look for excuses
not to go home.

20:35.684 --> 20:37.060
Hello, Joe?

20:37.124 --> 20:38.212
Oh, Harry.

20:39.525 --> 20:41.380
All right, I'll be right there.

20:41.444 --> 20:44.740
-Get on the nose wheels.
-How deep should we go?

20:44.804 --> 20:48.292
You've got about three feet
at the wheels.

20:50.724 --> 20:54.500
The forecast is for it
to go on like this for days.

20:54.564 --> 20:57.541
We need a lot more men.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.460
I'll try to round up some.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.060
Maybe there's an easier way.

21:01.125 --> 21:04.292
Captain Demerest has
a good idea. Captain!

21:05.828 --> 21:07.332
Tell Mr. Bakersfeld.

21:08.485 --> 21:11.301
My idea will make you
aviation man of the year,

21:11.366 --> 21:14.052
and Captain Benson
agrees with me.

21:14.821 --> 21:17.861
Put pneumatic jacks under
the jacking plates and lift her.

21:17.925 --> 21:21.926
Then you fill in, plank over,
and roll her off on the flat.

21:22.021 --> 21:24.901
If every jack isn't absolutely
level, she'll slide off,

21:24.964 --> 21:27.141
and you'll have a hole.

21:27.205 --> 21:29.060
I'll stick with
Patroni's judgment.

21:29.093 --> 21:31.940
Do it the hard way,
but you better move this.

21:32.005 --> 21:33.700
I'm not taking off on 22.

21:33.764 --> 21:35.205
You'll use what's available.

21:35.301 --> 21:39.941
If it's 22, I'm not cutting back
on power over those houses.

21:40.005 --> 21:41.540
Unless you want a bill...

21:41.605 --> 21:43.621
for cracked plaster
and broken dishes,

21:43.685 --> 21:45.221
you'd better move this.

21:47.845 --> 21:50.181
Keep digging.
Another pilot gets an idea,

21:50.245 --> 21:51.493
hand him a shovel.

21:56.486 --> 21:57.573
Yes, Peter?

21:57.700 --> 22:00.453
Uh, Mrs. Livingston,
I've got that stowaway...

22:00.549 --> 22:02.405
that Mr. Miller told you about.

22:03.045 --> 22:04.133
Bring him in.

22:09.285 --> 22:12.261
Hello. I'm Mrs. Ada Quonsett.

22:12.325 --> 22:14.181
I'm Mrs. Livingston.
Pleased to-

22:14.246 --> 22:16.421
I mean, won't you-
Sit down.

22:16.485 --> 22:19.653
Thank you. It was a long walk
from that gate.

22:21.765 --> 22:24.454
We've got some talking to do.
Lock that door.

22:28.645 --> 22:30.501
You've done
this sort of thing before.

22:30.565 --> 22:31.781
Yes, my dear.

22:31.846 --> 22:34.022
It's illegal.
Why do you do it?

22:34.085 --> 22:37.381
I'm a widow and have
a married daughter in New York.

22:37.446 --> 22:40.261
Sometimes I get lonely for her
and the grandchildren,

22:40.326 --> 22:45.061
so I go to Los Angeles and get
on a plane going to New York.

22:45.125 --> 22:48.229
When I'm ready to go home,
it's, well, vice versa.

22:48.293 --> 22:49.926
Without a ticket?

22:50.021 --> 22:52.101
I couldn't possibly afford
a ticket.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.182
I just have
my social security...

22:54.245 --> 22:57.382
and the small pension
my late husband left me.

22:57.445 --> 22:59.494
Have you stowed away
on other airlines?

22:59.590 --> 23:03.014
Oh, yes, but I like
Trans Global the best.

23:03.845 --> 23:06.373
Well, it's nice to meet
a satisfied customer.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.022
How about Patroni?

23:10.086 --> 23:11.941
Highway Patrol's
bringing him in.

23:12.006 --> 23:14.501
-How long before he's here?
-Half an hour.

23:14.566 --> 23:16.742
Good. Now I'll have
that sandwich.

23:16.806 --> 23:20.582
I'm starving. I haven't eaten
since about-Oh, I'm sorry.

23:20.646 --> 23:22.181
No, don't go away.

23:22.246 --> 23:24.422
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Quonsett,

23:24.486 --> 23:26.982
the stowaway
I was talking about before.

23:27.046 --> 23:30.982
This is Mr. Bakersfeld,
General Manager of the airport.

23:31.046 --> 23:32.742
Well, how do you do?

23:32.806 --> 23:35.815
It's a pleasure to meet
someone so important.

23:35.911 --> 23:37.542
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

23:37.606 --> 23:39.782
Don't go.
Come sit with us.

23:39.846 --> 23:42.662
Have a cup of coffee
and a sandwich.

23:42.726 --> 23:45.542
Perhaps Mr. Bakersfeld could
impress upon Mrs. Quonsett...

23:45.606 --> 23:47.942
that this isn't
a nice thing to do.

23:48.006 --> 23:50.374
Mrs. Livingston
hasn't been able to.

23:54.567 --> 23:58.183
Uh, yes.
Uh... uh, Mrs. Quonsett,

23:58.278 --> 24:01.254
uh, what you've done
is, uh, is dishonest.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.974
You've broken the law.

24:05.446 --> 24:07.335
You defrauded Trans Global.

24:08.967 --> 24:10.823
They can prosecute you.

24:10.887 --> 24:12.742
But they wouldn't, would they?

24:12.807 --> 24:16.262
It wouldn't be very good
public relations to prosecute

24:16.358 --> 24:19.142
a little old lady because she
wanted to visit her daughter.

24:23.878 --> 24:26.182
-May I have one?
-Well, sure.

24:26.279 --> 24:29.702
On the plane, the beef
was a little too well done,

24:29.798 --> 24:32.582
and the salad dressing
had garlic in it.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.438
You should tell them, my dear,

24:34.503 --> 24:38.182
that very often elderly people
can't tolerate garlic.

24:38.278 --> 24:39.654
Gives them gas.

24:40.679 --> 24:44.679
Well, I'll certainly mention it
to our chef. Thank you.

24:44.743 --> 24:46.503
Not at all.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.038
Look, Mrs. Quonsett,

24:48.103 --> 24:51.463
since you've had so much
free travel from Trans Global,

24:51.559 --> 24:54.823
at least you could tell us
how you get aboard.

24:54.919 --> 24:58.983
Well, I use many methods, but I
like to be in the airport...

24:59.079 --> 25:00.903
early enough to get
a boarding pass.

25:00.935 --> 25:03.176
But our boarding passes
are ticket folders.

25:03.271 --> 25:04.423
I know.

25:04.519 --> 25:08.743
I go to a counter and say I've
lost mine and need another one.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.623
The clerks are busy,
and lots of people are waiting.

25:11.719 --> 25:12.935
They always give me one.

25:14.918 --> 25:18.503
It's just a blank folder.
It isn't made out as a pass.

25:18.599 --> 25:20.614
I do that myself
in the ladies room.

25:21.479 --> 25:23.720
I know just what to write.

25:23.783 --> 25:27.143
I carry one of these black
pencils like the airlines use.

25:27.239 --> 25:28.423
-See?
-Yes, I do.

25:28.519 --> 25:30.503
I'll keep that
if you don't mind.

25:30.599 --> 25:33.224
It's really mine,
but if you want it,

25:33.319 --> 25:35.175
I can get another one.

25:35.879 --> 25:38.951
So now you have a boarding pass.
What then?

25:38.983 --> 25:41.191
Then I go to the departure gate.

25:41.224 --> 25:42.663
-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.223
I wait till the man
checking tickets is busy.

25:45.319 --> 25:47.783
Then I walk past
and onto the plane.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.959
Do you hear that, Mr. Coakley?

25:50.023 --> 25:52.423
No one stops you,
not even the stewardesses?

25:52.519 --> 25:53.863
If you get on late,

25:53.960 --> 25:57.063
they're hanging up coats
and talking to the men,

25:57.159 --> 26:02.023
and I just show them my folder
quickly, you see, like-

26:02.120 --> 26:03.496
I'll keep that, too.

26:04.231 --> 26:07.271
But I'm sure you don't always
use a boarding pass.

26:07.303 --> 26:10.824
No. Sometimes I tell them
that my son has gone aboard...

26:10.920 --> 26:12.744
but he dropped his wallet.

26:12.840 --> 26:16.744
I carry a man's wallet
in my hand...

26:18.440 --> 26:20.104
That works best of all.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.864
I must say, Mrs. Quonsett,

26:21.960 --> 26:24.456
you have everything
figured out very carefully.

26:24.551 --> 26:26.984
My late husband taught me
to be thorough.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.904
He was a teacher of geometry.

26:33.321 --> 26:36.904
My late husband was a lawyer,
and he always said,

26:40.041 --> 26:41.960
Now I understand what he meant.

26:42.024 --> 26:43.464
You're a widow, too.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.384
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear,

26:45.480 --> 26:47.944
but you're young and attractive,
and I'm sure-

26:48.040 --> 26:51.144
Let's confine the conversation
to you, Mrs. Quonsett.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.120
We're sending you back to
Los Angeles on the next flight.

26:54.185 --> 26:56.136
Yes, I was afraid of that.

26:57.321 --> 27:01.224
I would like a cup of tea first,
so I'll go now.

27:01.319 --> 27:02.952
When do you want me back?

27:02.984 --> 27:05.544
Oh, no, you're not going
anywhere alone.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.625
Mrs. Quonsett will be
on flight 103.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.120
Stick with her every second
until departure.

27:10.184 --> 27:13.225
-Don't lose sight of her.
-Ma'am, she'll need a ticket.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.944
Yes. That will be a change,
won't it?

27:16.041 --> 27:17.704
I'll make out an order.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.784
May I please have my tea now?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.864
Yes, you-Where are you going?

27:21.961 --> 27:23.624
In the Commander's Club.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.545
Mrs. Quonsett,
that's for members only.

27:25.641 --> 27:27.273
But I have a card.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.585
This card says
Mrs. Henry Jackson.

27:32.681 --> 27:35.560
My friend Gertrude lets me
use it when I'm traveling.

27:35.624 --> 27:39.305
We'll send it back to Gertrude
with a very strong letter.

27:39.401 --> 27:41.256
We'll go this way,
Mrs. Quonsett.

27:44.681 --> 27:45.737
Good-bye.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.297
Good-bye, ma'am.

27:48.393 --> 27:51.336
You have been very nice.
Thank you.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.624
I don't believe it.

27:59.688 --> 28:01.544
I just don't believe it.

28:01.642 --> 28:04.584
You were a big help giving her
that VIP treatment-

28:04.680 --> 28:06.505
deference, courtesy, sandwiches.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.745
Why not break open
a bottle of champagne?

28:08.841 --> 28:11.625
If we had one, I would have.
She's fabulous.

28:11.721 --> 28:13.384
She just laughed at us.

28:13.481 --> 28:15.625
Take it easy.
There have been stowaways...

28:15.721 --> 28:18.185
ever since the Egyptians
sailed the Red Sea.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.745
When they caught them,
they tossed them overboard.

28:20.841 --> 28:23.465
The airlines won't do a thing,
and she knows it.

28:23.562 --> 28:25.065
Crafty little old biddy.

28:25.161 --> 28:28.584
Come on. Relax. She only stole
a ride, not a plane.

28:28.681 --> 28:29.769
I know, but...

28:33.161 --> 28:35.626
Mel, they've been
pressuring me...

28:35.721 --> 28:38.185
about that transfer
to San Francisco.

28:38.281 --> 28:39.786
I think I'll take it.

28:39.881 --> 28:43.050
The pay is better.
The climate will do me good.

28:44.201 --> 28:45.386
No snow.

28:45.482 --> 28:46.569
Yes.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.090
It's a beautiful city.
I'll miss you.

28:50.985 --> 28:53.449
Will you... enough
not to let me go?

28:54.825 --> 28:58.826
I'm sorry. You've been honest
with me from the beginning-

28:58.922 --> 29:01.225
no false hopes, no promises.

29:01.962 --> 29:04.105
I'm not as honest as you think.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.889
I said I invented excuses
not to go home.

29:08.041 --> 29:10.410
But I didn't mention why I stay.

29:14.602 --> 29:17.449
I tell myself I've got to
hold things together...

29:18.922 --> 29:20.490
for the children's sake.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.425
But I'm not sure that's true
or even kind.

29:24.521 --> 29:27.305
They know what's going on,
and it's hurting them,

29:27.401 --> 29:28.490
especially Roberta.

29:30.121 --> 29:32.745
I think about
my mother and father, and...

29:32.843 --> 29:35.690
God knows they had
their ups and downs.

29:36.682 --> 29:39.850
But somehow they...
somehow they worked it out.

29:41.002 --> 29:44.330
I feel I should do the same,
or else I've failed.

29:44.906 --> 29:46.410
I don't like to fail.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.690
I don't know what to do.

29:54.411 --> 29:57.001
Maybe you love your wife
more than you realize.

29:57.066 --> 29:58.986
No. No.

29:59.081 --> 30:00.650
Not for a long time.

30:01.483 --> 30:04.234
The only thing we've got
in common is our address.

30:07.403 --> 30:09.130
I'm not pressing you, Mel.

30:10.122 --> 30:12.170
I wouldn't play
that kind of game.

30:12.842 --> 30:15.690
But I better take
that job in San Francisco.

30:16.522 --> 30:17.770
Mrs. Livingston.

30:18.763 --> 30:21.227
-Yes?
-Excuse me, Mrs. Livingston,

30:21.322 --> 30:22.666
but customs just called.

30:22.762 --> 30:25.450
The chief wants you.
He says it's important.

30:25.962 --> 30:27.050
All right.

30:31.883 --> 30:34.186
One of our passengers
is demanding...

30:34.283 --> 30:37.226
to speak to someone in authority
from Trans Global.

30:43.467 --> 30:47.626
Will you explain to this man
that this isn't the Dark Ages,

30:47.723 --> 30:49.867
that nowadays
stores in this country...

30:50.026 --> 30:52.074
import clothes from France?

30:52.267 --> 30:54.890
If you'd look, you'd see
the Bergdorf Goodman labels.

30:55.242 --> 30:57.707
Oh, I did look, madam,
rather closely,

30:57.802 --> 31:00.586
and I find the sewing
of the labels...

31:00.683 --> 31:03.307
isn't up to Bergdorf's
usual standard.

31:03.402 --> 31:06.667
They're always
very professional, very neat.

31:06.763 --> 31:10.251
As you can see, that's...
that's a pretty sloppy job.

31:11.083 --> 31:13.227
But I suppose everybody's
having trouble getting...

31:13.323 --> 31:14.795
good help these days.

31:14.891 --> 31:16.875
Especially the customs service.

31:24.843 --> 31:27.307
Well, what's the matter, boy?

31:27.402 --> 31:28.971
Is there something the matter?

31:29.483 --> 31:30.572
Huh?

31:31.083 --> 31:33.707
Oh, your collar's too tight.

31:33.803 --> 31:35.787
Officer, about the fur
and the dresses,

31:35.883 --> 31:37.228
perhaps I made a mistake.

31:37.323 --> 31:40.490
I did buy them there,
and there are some other...

31:54.283 --> 31:55.532
I'm sorry, madam.

31:57.803 --> 32:00.939
Check everything else
very carefully.

32:01.003 --> 32:03.979
Inspect the lining
of the bags and the cases.

32:04.043 --> 32:05.611
-Make a list.
-Yes, sir.

32:07.563 --> 32:08.843
Sorry, fella.

32:08.908 --> 32:11.499
I'd like to change that
declaration, please, officer.

32:11.564 --> 32:13.579
I beg of you.
My husband will-

32:13.644 --> 32:16.492
Madam, please sit down.
This might take some time.

32:17.132 --> 32:18.508
When will they learn?

32:18.604 --> 32:21.900
The duty would have been
1/10 of the fine.

32:21.963 --> 32:25.419
You are amazing. I never
would have suspected her.

32:25.484 --> 32:28.140
Well, after 30 years,
you kind of know.

32:28.203 --> 32:31.019
First I look in their eyes,
then the luggage.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.300
Thanks for coming.

32:32.364 --> 32:34.699
Now, may I ask you
another favor?

32:34.764 --> 32:37.739
If you want me to smuggle
anything, the answer is no.

32:37.803 --> 32:41.100
No. My sister's girl,
Judy Barton,

32:41.164 --> 32:43.980
will be on your number two
flight to Rome tonight.

32:44.044 --> 32:45.900
Can she have a window seat?

32:45.963 --> 32:47.691
-I'm sure of it.
-Good.

32:48.363 --> 32:51.116
-Oh, uh, Mrs. Livingston.
-Yes?

32:51.179 --> 32:53.581
Will it get off on time?

32:53.612 --> 32:55.020
Flight two, the Golden Argosy,

32:55.084 --> 32:57.356
will depart for Rome
on schedule.

32:57.452 --> 33:00.172
Good. Fine. Thank you.

34:24.045 --> 34:26.060
I thought
you were leaving tomorrow.

34:26.125 --> 34:28.141
No. I have to start work
tomorrow.

34:28.205 --> 34:31.502
I got to be in Milwaukee
tonight. Remember?

34:31.563 --> 34:34.061
Is this another one of those
hello/good-bye jobs?

34:34.125 --> 34:36.940
I talked to Mr. Williams
himself.

34:37.005 --> 34:39.021
175 a week.

34:39.085 --> 34:41.260
Look, this is
a 30-story building.

34:41.324 --> 34:44.460
The job will last, uh...
eight months at least.

34:44.525 --> 34:45.773
I hope so.

34:47.726 --> 34:50.061
This time do me one favor.

34:50.125 --> 34:53.516
If your boss says two and two
is six, agree with him.

34:53.581 --> 34:57.837
Whatever way he wants to do
anything, that's my way.

34:57.934 --> 34:59.597
Don't lose your temper.

34:59.661 --> 35:02.701
And Williams said that
after the job in Milwaukee,

35:02.765 --> 35:03.982
they're building in Detroit,

35:04.046 --> 35:07.661
and he said they may subcontract
the excavating to me.

35:07.725 --> 35:09.421
Be satisfied
that you're working.

35:09.485 --> 35:11.021
I am, but you'll see.

35:11.085 --> 35:14.254
Everything will be fine,
the way it used to be.

35:15.246 --> 35:19.054
Nothing's the way it used to be,
but I'm not complaining.

35:19.725 --> 35:23.022
You never do. How you could
stick with me after-

35:23.086 --> 35:26.637
"FFor better or for worse. "F
I meant what I said.

35:26.701 --> 35:28.782
It will be better again.
I promise.

35:28.845 --> 35:31.822
I've got an idea
the kids won't have to live...

35:31.886 --> 35:34.541
with your sister anymore
and you'll have money...

35:34.606 --> 35:36.782
and a nice home and clothes.

35:36.845 --> 35:39.981
Dom, stop dreaming.

35:40.046 --> 35:42.286
Just hold on to the job.

35:44.045 --> 35:47.598
I'll do it right this time.
I won't mess it up.

35:54.605 --> 35:56.302
How will you get to Milwaukee?

35:56.365 --> 35:59.021
The bus.
It leaves in a few minutes.

35:59.086 --> 36:02.222
I've got enough for that.
Then I can draw in advance...

36:02.286 --> 36:04.014
on my salary tomorrow.

36:05.006 --> 36:08.846
But I will need something
for a hotel room tonight.

36:08.942 --> 36:09.966
If you could-

36:10.062 --> 36:12.750
All I've got
is enough for the rent.

36:13.486 --> 36:14.893
Yeah. All right.

36:16.525 --> 36:17.614
Dom...

36:18.766 --> 36:21.294
the silverware is gone.
My watch is gone.

36:23.246 --> 36:26.190
My mother's ring-
don't pawn that.

36:31.086 --> 36:34.702
Here. I can give the landlord
another hard-luck story.

36:40.686 --> 36:41.934
Good-bye, Dom.

36:43.566 --> 36:44.654
Inez...

36:49.006 --> 36:51.022
I haven't been
a very good provider,

36:51.087 --> 36:53.710
but I will be.
I promise you that.

36:55.727 --> 36:57.582
Good-bye, Inez.

36:57.646 --> 37:00.750
I love you. I want you
to always remember that.

37:19.247 --> 37:20.334
Good-bye.

37:42.607 --> 37:43.855
$2.00.

37:44.526 --> 37:46.063
It's highway robbery.

37:46.127 --> 37:48.462
Why the airlines don't provide
free transportation...

37:48.527 --> 37:49.743
I'll never know.

37:49.807 --> 37:52.783
Mister, I just drive the bus.
You're holding up the line.

37:52.847 --> 37:53.935
Here, here.

38:11.406 --> 38:12.815
Hi, Anson.

38:13.808 --> 38:16.687
Why are you here so early?
Trying to impress me?

38:16.783 --> 38:18.672
How about an "FA"F for effort?

38:18.703 --> 38:21.263
We're using 324 tonight.
On her last flight,

38:21.327 --> 38:23.183
number two engine
gave them trouble.

38:23.247 --> 38:25.424
I wondered what
maintenance did about it.

38:25.488 --> 38:27.343
I hope we got a new one.

38:27.407 --> 38:30.223
They even replaced the wiring
to be on the safe side.

38:30.288 --> 38:32.335
That's the side I like.

38:33.327 --> 38:34.703
What's the matter?

38:34.767 --> 38:36.943
The last time
you checked me out,

38:37.008 --> 38:39.503
you marked me for not wearing
a regulation shirt.

38:39.568 --> 38:41.263
I was hoping to get even.

38:41.327 --> 38:44.303
Not a chance.
Knowing how tough you can be,

38:44.367 --> 38:46.383
tonight I even polished
my wings.

38:53.647 --> 38:55.023
Thanks, fellas!

38:55.088 --> 38:58.704
I tried to get more help, Joe,
but I only got 20 men.

38:58.767 --> 39:02.383
I did a little phoning
from my car. I got 50.

39:02.447 --> 39:03.984
Where'd you get them from?

39:04.048 --> 39:05.744
Braniff, Delta, Continental.

39:05.807 --> 39:07.984
We're not like
those front office stiffs...

39:08.047 --> 39:11.183
who wear ties and steal
passengers from each other.

39:11.248 --> 39:13.104
Maintenance-it's like a circus.

39:13.168 --> 39:15.984
One of us gets in trouble,
they all come running.

39:16.047 --> 39:19.216
Let's go. I got a beautiful dame
waiting for me.

39:34.288 --> 39:37.776
We should be above this
in about 20 minutes. Let's hope.

39:40.528 --> 39:41.903
-Forget something?
-No.

39:41.968 --> 39:45.264
Just checking the Rome weather.
It's not too cold and sunny.

39:45.329 --> 39:47.344
As usual, I've brought
the wrong clothes.

39:47.408 --> 39:50.416
-I don't have a thing to wear.
-Great.

39:54.223 --> 39:57.584
I'll have this mother out
by midnight, so stop worrying.

39:57.649 --> 39:59.984
The party starts at 12:01.

40:00.081 --> 40:02.896
I'll settle for a box of cigars.
See you later.

40:06.481 --> 40:08.464
You keep leaning
on that shovel, Jack,

40:08.561 --> 40:10.544
you're going to freeze solid
like Lot's wife.

40:10.641 --> 40:13.424
We want to move this airplane
before it becomes obsolete.

40:13.521 --> 40:15.824
The way you guys keep
heading for this bus...

40:15.920 --> 40:18.065
looks like you got a broad
stashed in there!

40:18.161 --> 40:20.016
Out! Everybody out!

40:28.240 --> 40:29.264
P. A.: Attention.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.153
Attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

40:31.185 --> 40:33.552
Trans Global Airlines
regrets to announce...

40:33.584 --> 40:35.025
that the Golden Argosy
flight two to Rome...

40:35.121 --> 40:37.136
will not depart until 11 p. m.

40:38.738 --> 40:41.584
We are indeed sorry,
but this is due solely...

40:41.680 --> 40:43.504
to the condition
of the highways,

40:43.601 --> 40:44.945
which is causing
unavoidable delays...

40:45.041 --> 40:46.192
in ground transportation.

40:46.224 --> 40:48.625
Those of you on flight two
to Rome, don't worry.

40:48.721 --> 40:49.937
They're going to hold the plane.

40:50.033 --> 40:52.305
Just relax.
I'll get you there in time.

40:52.401 --> 40:54.865
They could have decided that
before we left the terminal.

40:54.961 --> 40:56.945
Making us sit here and worry-
it's inexcusable.

40:57.041 --> 40:59.858
-Go away. Your nose is running.
-No!

41:18.385 --> 41:20.497
Of course,
if it's not crowded, I...

41:22.065 --> 41:25.745
Here's the ticket.
It's flight 103.

41:25.841 --> 41:28.177
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, no, you don't.

41:31.121 --> 41:33.777
My, she has a suspicious nature.

41:34.481 --> 41:36.305
Well, go on.
You were saying...

41:36.401 --> 41:38.385
you prefer the flights
that aren't direct.

41:38.481 --> 41:41.425
Yes. That's why your flight 86
is my favorite-

41:41.521 --> 41:44.081
St. Louis, Kansas City, Chicago.

41:44.145 --> 41:45.905
Yes, but I should think
they check...

41:46.001 --> 41:47.186
at all the intermediate stops.

41:47.282 --> 41:50.705
I pretend to be asleep.
Usually they don't disturb me.

41:50.801 --> 41:52.017
But this time they caught you.

41:52.561 --> 41:54.865
It was that man
sitting next to me.

41:54.962 --> 41:56.466
I confided in him,

41:56.561 --> 41:59.345
and he betrayed me
to the stewardess.

41:59.441 --> 42:01.938
He was a policeman
from San Diego.

42:02.802 --> 42:06.386
I think they should make them
always wear their uniforms.

42:06.481 --> 42:08.658
Otherwise,
how's a person to know?

42:11.442 --> 42:14.226
Hi, Mel. I was just
going to have you paged.

42:14.322 --> 42:17.106
-I had to go out in the field.
-We got trouble, Mel.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.345
I talked to the lawyer
for those Meadowood people,

42:19.442 --> 42:21.105
and he says
unless we stop planes...

42:21.202 --> 42:23.185
from taking off
over their houses by midnight,

42:23.282 --> 42:24.786
he's starting a damage suit...

42:24.882 --> 42:27.954
first thing in the morning
for $10 million.

42:28.081 --> 42:31.026
That's a nice round figure.
He hasn't got a prayer.

42:31.122 --> 42:33.234
He might not win,
but he can sue.

42:33.266 --> 42:34.545
Any legal action
will only make...

42:34.643 --> 42:37.106
our public relations
worse than they already are,

42:37.202 --> 42:39.506
and that's something
the other commissioners and I...

42:39.602 --> 42:40.817
don't want to risk.

42:42.481 --> 42:43.826
What do you propose to do
about it?

42:43.922 --> 42:46.385
Well, there's only one answer-
shut down runway 22...

42:46.482 --> 42:47.954
and cut out the noise
over Meadowood.

42:48.018 --> 42:49.266
And with two-niner out,

42:49.362 --> 42:51.025
that means closing down
the airport completely.

42:51.122 --> 42:52.275
Only until morning.

42:52.306 --> 42:54.706
After all, you've promised them
dozens of times...

42:54.803 --> 42:56.146
you wouldn't disturb
their sleep.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.386
I promised we wouldn't take off
over their houses...

42:58.482 --> 42:59.666
unless there was an emergency,

42:59.762 --> 43:01.426
and I promised them
something else:

43:01.523 --> 43:02.706
In the foreseeable future,

43:02.802 --> 43:04.594
the noise problem would not
get any better.

43:04.659 --> 43:07.506
If you don't want to spend
a couple of months in court,

43:07.602 --> 43:09.138
you better start
conning them a little.

43:09.682 --> 43:11.634
You think lying to them
is the answer?

43:11.698 --> 43:13.074
Oh, Mel.

43:13.106 --> 43:14.418
There's your answer.

43:15.026 --> 43:17.906
A modern expanded airport
big and efficient enough...

43:18.002 --> 43:20.306
to take anything
the designers can throw at us.

43:20.402 --> 43:22.066
That means buying off
Meadowood...

43:22.162 --> 43:23.666
and rezoning it
for industrial use...

43:23.762 --> 43:25.266
so the noise won't make
any difference.

43:25.363 --> 43:28.595
I didn't come here to talk
about the future of aviation.

43:28.659 --> 43:29.747
Well, you better start,

43:29.842 --> 43:31.698
and you better start
looking ahead a few years.

43:31.794 --> 43:32.947
What are we going to do...

43:33.042 --> 43:35.186
about these jumbos
that seat 500 passengers?

43:35.282 --> 43:37.938
How will we get people
to and from the airport?

43:38.034 --> 43:40.946
Save that for the women's clubs
and the Rotary luncheons.

43:41.042 --> 43:42.226
We've got to be practical.

43:42.322 --> 43:44.947
Sure, sure, ignore it.
Don't stick your neck out.

43:45.042 --> 43:47.506
It's about time that you
and the other commissioners...

43:47.603 --> 43:48.946
began fighting
for a bond issue...

43:49.042 --> 43:50.835
to finance this kind
of an airport...

43:50.898 --> 43:52.306
instead of running around...

43:52.403 --> 43:54.226
checking to see
if the toilets flush.

43:54.323 --> 43:56.627
I don't think insulting me is
going to solve anything,

43:56.722 --> 43:58.355
so let's get back
to our immediate problem.

43:58.420 --> 44:01.106
We've got to make a decision
about tonight!

44:01.203 --> 44:03.155
I've made it.
The airport's staying open.

44:03.251 --> 44:05.715
Mel, stop being so bullheaded.
Think of the consequences.

44:05.779 --> 44:07.187
Don't talk to me
about consequences.

44:07.282 --> 44:10.067
When Congress voted to cut
airport appropriations,

44:10.162 --> 44:12.467
you never even sent in
a letter of protest.

44:12.626 --> 44:14.386
Where were you when the airlines
and the pilots...

44:14.483 --> 44:16.306
and the rest of us
were pleading...

44:16.404 --> 44:18.387
for more airports
and better traffic control?

44:18.483 --> 44:21.106
You were picking out the colors
in the ladies lounge.

44:21.203 --> 44:22.834
So now you've got
your consequences-

44:22.930 --> 44:25.587
congested air traffic
where Sunday pilots hold up...

44:25.683 --> 44:27.507
airliners with thousands
of people aboard...

44:27.603 --> 44:30.067
and force us to stack up
planes bound for New York...

44:30.163 --> 44:31.411
as far away as Denver.

44:31.475 --> 44:33.907
When it comes to politics,
you're a child.

44:34.003 --> 44:36.147
Two of our councilmen
live in Meadowood.

44:36.244 --> 44:38.228
Think what they could do
to us downtown!

44:38.324 --> 44:40.787
I'm thinking of those pilots
upstairs waiting to land,

44:40.883 --> 44:42.227
flying blind in that muck...

44:42.323 --> 44:45.106
and circling in holding patterns
and praying to God...

44:45.203 --> 44:47.347
that some tired, overworked,
underpaid controller...

44:47.443 --> 44:48.467
in the tower...

44:48.563 --> 44:50.292
doesn't have another plane
on the same course.

44:50.356 --> 44:52.787
You can call it pigheaded.
Call it anything you want.

44:52.883 --> 44:54.706
As long as we're not
below F. A. A. minimums,

44:54.804 --> 44:55.891
we're not closing down.

44:57.684 --> 44:59.667
All right,
if that's the way you want it.

44:59.763 --> 45:01.107
I'm calling
the other commissioners,

45:01.204 --> 45:03.187
and I'll let you know
what our decision is...

45:03.284 --> 45:04.307
within an hour.

45:04.404 --> 45:06.068
That's your privilege.
You hired me,

45:06.164 --> 45:07.507
and you've got
the right to fire me,

45:07.603 --> 45:09.971
but until you do,
this airport is staying open.

45:56.852 --> 45:58.708
Do you wish to make
a reservation?

45:58.804 --> 46:01.107
No, I don't.
Could you please tell me...

46:01.203 --> 46:03.188
if there's a flight to Rome
tonight?

46:03.283 --> 46:05.589
Yes, our Golden Argosy
flight two.

46:05.684 --> 46:07.028
It departs at 10 p. m.

46:07.123 --> 46:08.627
Only tonight,
it's delayed one hour...

46:08.725 --> 46:10.388
due to weather conditions.

46:10.484 --> 46:12.788
Well, could you-
it's very important to me...

46:12.884 --> 46:14.708
to find out if somebody's
on that flight.

46:14.804 --> 46:17.108
His name is D. O. Guerrero.

46:17.204 --> 46:18.388
I'm terribly sorry.

46:18.483 --> 46:20.308
We're not allowed to give out
that information.

46:20.404 --> 46:21.909
You don't understand.

46:22.004 --> 46:23.988
The person I'm asking about
is my husband.

46:24.084 --> 46:26.868
I am sorry,
but it's a company rule.

46:26.964 --> 46:28.788
You might go out to the airport.

46:28.885 --> 46:31.349
If you can get there
before they board the flight,

46:31.445 --> 46:33.108
you could see your husband
if he's there.

46:33.205 --> 46:37.172
I see. Well, if that's
the only way, I suppose.

46:37.684 --> 46:40.308
Thank you. Thank you.

46:40.405 --> 46:42.452
Thank you for calling
Trans Global.

46:57.429 --> 46:59.412
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

47:00.245 --> 47:03.573
I tried, but we were in a hurry,
and...

47:04.245 --> 47:05.492
You're sure?

47:06.005 --> 47:07.669
Do you mean
am I sure I'm pregnant...

47:07.765 --> 47:10.068
or am I sure you're the father?

47:10.165 --> 47:11.508
Come on, Gwen. I didn't-

47:11.605 --> 47:13.237
The answer
to both questions is yes.

47:13.333 --> 47:14.549
You know I wasn't asking-

47:14.644 --> 47:15.925
You have a perfect right to.

47:15.989 --> 47:18.454
I want you to know
something, Vern...

47:19.445 --> 47:21.492
that there hasn't been
anyone else but you.

47:22.804 --> 47:25.236
You see, there couldn't be.
I happen to love you.

47:27.925 --> 47:29.429
I'm afraid I was careless.

47:29.524 --> 47:30.869
I stopped taking the pills...

47:30.965 --> 47:32.854
because they were making me
gain weight,

47:32.917 --> 47:35.637
so instead of being plump,
I'm pregnant.

47:37.365 --> 47:39.413
Stop twisting your wedding ring.

47:39.926 --> 47:43.253
I know you've got a wife.
I know you can't marry me.

47:44.085 --> 47:45.493
I knew it in the beginning.

47:47.765 --> 47:49.493
I won't make things
difficult for you.

47:50.005 --> 47:51.348
I'll work it out myself.

47:51.445 --> 47:52.629
Don't be ridiculous, Gwen.

47:52.725 --> 47:55.604
You don't think I'd walk out
and ignore the whole thing?

47:55.669 --> 47:56.950
I'll take care of you.

47:57.045 --> 47:58.549
I'll make sure you don't go...

47:58.645 --> 48:01.173
to some butcher
two flights up over a drugstore.

48:01.749 --> 48:03.861
I hear Sweden's the best place.

48:03.926 --> 48:07.029
Good doctors, good hospitals,
medically safe.

48:07.125 --> 48:09.173
Very quick, very simple.

48:09.686 --> 48:11.893
One minute you have it,
next minute you don't.

48:12.725 --> 48:14.582
There's no danger
of complications.

48:14.645 --> 48:16.853
That is,
no physical complications.

48:17.685 --> 48:20.182
I'm not so sure
about the moral ones.

48:21.045 --> 48:23.221
You have religious scruples?

48:23.285 --> 48:25.174
No, no...

48:26.646 --> 48:28.662
but the strangest thing
happened to me today...

48:28.726 --> 48:29.973
when the doctor told me.

48:30.486 --> 48:33.141
I've known other girls
in the same situation...

48:33.205 --> 48:35.221
toss it off with bad jokes...

48:35.285 --> 48:36.981
like "Fl've got a bun
in the oven... "F

48:37.045 --> 48:39.894
or "FCaptain, we've got
an extra passenger on board. "F

48:40.726 --> 48:42.741
I knew I'd react the same way...

48:43.286 --> 48:45.493
very modern, very sophisticated.

48:48.246 --> 48:49.494
But I certainly didn't.

48:51.445 --> 48:55.094
I was suddenly filled
with a sense of wonder and awe.

48:55.926 --> 48:58.038
I don't want to sound
mystical or anything,

48:58.135 --> 49:02.134
but I am carrying someone
who's part of us.

49:03.446 --> 49:05.494
I'm not so sure
I want to lose it.

49:07.287 --> 49:09.782
And if you have the baby,
then what?

49:12.406 --> 49:15.574
Well, I suppose adoption
would be the answer.

49:16.726 --> 49:18.903
They're very careful nowadays.

49:18.966 --> 49:20.278
They find the right family.

49:20.342 --> 49:21.462
They're very careful,

49:21.526 --> 49:23.574
and all the arrangements
are made beforehand...

49:24.086 --> 49:26.774
and the records are kept secret,
you know...

49:27.766 --> 49:29.654
and you'll never see the baby.

49:36.887 --> 49:38.422
I suppose in time
I'll be sensible,

49:38.486 --> 49:40.694
but I've got to have time
to think.

49:47.926 --> 49:50.454
Vern, thank you for caring.

49:52.087 --> 49:55.094
Most men would have said,
"FSo long, girl. Tough luck. "F

49:56.087 --> 49:57.495
Not this one.

50:05.686 --> 50:08.375
You know, I think
you really do love me a little.

50:10.167 --> 50:12.054
It makes it harder to decide...

50:13.047 --> 50:14.455
but easier to bear.

50:22.646 --> 50:24.022
Is something wrong, Gwen?

50:24.087 --> 50:26.263
The air vent was stuck.
The captain fixed it.

50:26.326 --> 50:27.254
Oh.

50:38.583 --> 50:40.055
Full throttle!

50:49.303 --> 50:50.775
All the way!

51:06.776 --> 51:08.184
You chickened out on me.

51:08.247 --> 51:09.944
I said I wanted
all the power you got.

51:10.007 --> 51:12.183
At full throttle, this plane
would be standing on its nose.

51:12.247 --> 51:14.263
You might fly these things,
but I take them apart...

51:14.327 --> 51:15.703
and put them
back together again.

51:15.767 --> 51:17.623
If you had any guts,
we'd be on the runway by now.

51:17.688 --> 51:18.903
You felt it vibrating.

51:18.967 --> 51:21.463
Another 10 seconds,
we'd have had structural damage.

51:21.528 --> 51:24.664
You're not talking
to some kid that fixes bicycles.

51:24.727 --> 51:26.583
I know every inch of the 707.

51:26.647 --> 51:29.143
Take the wings off this,
and you could use it as a tank.

51:29.208 --> 51:31.384
This plane is built
to withstand anything...

51:31.447 --> 51:32.983
except a bad pilot.

51:33.047 --> 51:34.264
All right, hold it.

51:34.327 --> 51:35.704
This kind of talk
will get us nowhere.

51:35.768 --> 51:37.623
You might tell your mechanic...

51:37.687 --> 51:39.224
I've got over three million
miles in the air.

51:39.288 --> 51:40.984
And 21/2 feet
in the ground.

51:41.047 --> 51:43.735
Let's stop wasting time!
What do we do now?

51:44.504 --> 51:47.223
Now we got to dig a lot deeper,
put lumber under the wheels,

51:47.288 --> 51:48.503
but the next time we try,

51:48.568 --> 51:50.136
since he's afraid,
I'll drive it out.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.863
I'm not turning this ship
over to anybody...

51:51.928 --> 51:53.624
without authorization
from our chief pilot.

51:53.688 --> 51:55.703
I phoned Kettering,
but there's no answer.

51:55.768 --> 51:57.624
We'll just sit here and wait
till you get him.

51:57.687 --> 51:59.224
No, we don't.
We haven't got time.

51:59.287 --> 52:00.504
You're not in the air, Captain.

52:00.567 --> 52:01.784
You're on the ground-
my ground-

52:01.848 --> 52:03.383
and you're blocking
my primary runway.

52:03.447 --> 52:05.944
I'm not using full power.
It's too risky.

52:06.007 --> 52:07.383
Then I'll make the decision.

52:07.448 --> 52:09.624
I'll take the responsibility
for the aircraft.

52:09.689 --> 52:11.736
Mr. Patroni is licensed to taxi.
He'll take over.

52:27.928 --> 52:29.144
If he tears this ship apart,

52:29.207 --> 52:31.096
you better have eight million
to pay for it.

52:36.568 --> 52:40.184
Joe, my neck's out
about 14 feet.

52:40.248 --> 52:41.496
Sure it will work?

52:42.008 --> 52:43.225
Buzz, put it this way.

52:43.288 --> 52:45.784
You promised me a box of cigars
if I pull this off.

52:45.848 --> 52:47.895
What are you standing here for?
Go get them.

52:53.688 --> 52:57.144
Bus from the downtown terminal
is just coming in.

52:57.208 --> 52:58.872
P. A.: Your attention, please.

52:58.936 --> 53:00.984
Trans Global Airlines'
the Golden Argosy...

53:01.048 --> 53:04.345
flight two nonstop to Rome
is now ready for boarding.

53:04.409 --> 53:06.425
All passengers holding
confirmed reservations,

53:06.488 --> 53:10.137
please proceed to gate 33,
green concourse "FD."F

53:19.448 --> 53:20.856
Oh, Rome.

53:22.649 --> 53:25.177
The Colosseum,
the Sistine Chapel...

53:25.848 --> 53:27.417
the Catacombs.

53:28.568 --> 53:32.505
My dear late husband and I
always planned to visit there.

53:32.568 --> 53:35.417
"FSee Rome and die,"F
he always said...

53:36.408 --> 53:39.417
but he died
just when we were packing.

53:39.512 --> 53:40.665
Oh, gee, that's too bad.

53:40.729 --> 53:44.536
Yes. So near, and yet so far.

53:53.529 --> 53:54.617
What's wrong?

53:55.448 --> 53:57.145
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

53:57.209 --> 53:59.226
-What is it, Mrs. Quonsett?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

53:59.288 --> 54:01.464
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
I'm having one of my spells.

54:01.529 --> 54:03.065
I'll get help.
I'll call for a doctor.

54:03.129 --> 54:04.985
Oh, it's-I'll be all right.

54:05.048 --> 54:08.825
I've had them for years.
It will pass.

54:08.888 --> 54:12.376
Oh, dear! If I could just
lie down for a little while.

54:13.048 --> 54:17.657
I saw a cot in the ladies room
a little while ago.

54:18.649 --> 54:19.673
I'll help you.
Come on.

54:20.409 --> 54:21.498
Take it easy.

54:23.769 --> 54:25.306
Are you sure you're
going to be all right?

54:25.369 --> 54:27.033
Sit down along the way
if you're not.

54:36.089 --> 54:37.945
You'll be all right.
We'll be there in a second.

54:38.009 --> 54:39.865
I'm much better-much better.

54:39.929 --> 54:41.785
Are you sure you don't want me
to call for the doctor?

54:41.849 --> 54:43.865
Oh, no.
I'm in enough trouble already.

54:43.929 --> 54:45.305
But-but don't go away.

54:45.369 --> 54:48.026
You will stay right here
like you did before, won't you?

54:48.089 --> 54:49.497
Oh, certainly.
I'll stay right here.

54:55.929 --> 54:57.946
Perhaps you're right.
You better get a doctor.

54:58.009 --> 54:59.098
Of course, right away.

54:59.929 --> 55:03.065
But don't worry.
I'll be all right.

55:03.130 --> 55:04.345
There's an attendant in there.

55:04.410 --> 55:06.457
She'll take care of you.
I won't be a minute.

55:08.250 --> 55:09.337
Thank you.

55:34.490 --> 55:37.786
Uh, that is E-R-O.

55:37.851 --> 55:40.666
And what amount policy were you
considering, Mr. Guerrero?

55:40.730 --> 55:43.194
Uh, 150,000.

55:43.258 --> 55:45.305
-That will be $5.00.
-Yes, I know.

55:45.370 --> 55:49.306
But for $2.50 more,
you could take out 225,000.

55:49.370 --> 55:51.386
It isn't much extra
for all that protection.

55:51.450 --> 55:53.306
I don't know
if I have that much left-

55:53.371 --> 55:56.187
American money. I exchanged
all my dollars to lira.

55:56.282 --> 55:57.658
Oh, we accept foreign currency.

55:57.754 --> 56:01.018
Yeah, well, I've got that
all in big bills.

56:01.114 --> 56:02.586
We'll take a personal check
if you like.

56:02.650 --> 56:04.666
No. When I go to Europe,

56:04.762 --> 56:07.067
I always leave my checkbook
at home.

56:07.130 --> 56:09.627
You know, it's too much
of a temptation.

56:09.722 --> 56:11.578
Oh, wait a minute.
I may have enough.

56:12.602 --> 56:14.267
I didn't mean to push you,

56:14.362 --> 56:15.866
but we're having
a sales contest,

56:15.962 --> 56:17.627
and I've got a chance
for the prize.

56:17.723 --> 56:19.066
Every little bit helps.

56:19.163 --> 56:21.146
Yeah. Could you
hurry that up, please?

56:21.243 --> 56:22.586
They've already
called my flight.

56:22.682 --> 56:24.699
Oh, just the first call.
You still have time.

56:33.722 --> 56:36.155
But I distinctly asked
for the fourth row.

56:38.523 --> 56:41.146
I'm terribly sorry.
This is the best we can do.

56:41.242 --> 56:42.939
Well, give it to me.

56:44.443 --> 56:47.067
Did you say this is
some kind of exchange program?

56:47.162 --> 56:50.107
Yes. You see, the Italian girl
would be living with my folks,

56:50.203 --> 56:51.546
and then I'll be living
with them.

56:51.643 --> 56:53.499
Oh, well, that should be
quite an experience.

57:09.882 --> 57:12.155
I'm sorry.
Could you hurry, please?

57:12.219 --> 57:14.939
There's the terminal, lady,
over there.

57:15.035 --> 57:16.667
Just be a couple more
minutes now.

57:18.075 --> 57:20.827
How about letting me
buy you a cup of coffee?

57:20.923 --> 57:24.027
Good. Mr. Bakersfeld's in there
having dinner. We can join him.

57:24.123 --> 57:25.467
Let me check
the calendar first.

57:25.563 --> 57:26.587
Right.

57:26.684 --> 57:28.987
Here you are, sir. Seat 23A.
Have a good flight.

57:29.083 --> 57:29.979
Thank you.

57:33.404 --> 57:35.707
Just two no-shows
in first class, huh?

57:35.803 --> 57:38.107
They've been waiting
in the Commander's Club.

57:40.763 --> 57:44.539
Oh, no. No. I'm just a visitor.
I work downstairs.

57:45.243 --> 57:46.619
Oh. Sorry.

57:54.043 --> 57:55.707
Ready?

57:55.803 --> 57:58.907
Did you see that man
with the attaché case just now?

57:59.003 --> 57:59.899
No.

58:00.924 --> 58:04.828
Well, if he were coming in from
abroad instead of going out,

58:04.923 --> 58:06.588
I'd want to inspect it.

58:06.683 --> 58:08.028
Do you think he's smuggling?

58:08.123 --> 58:11.228
It was the way he held the case,
the look in his eye.

58:11.323 --> 58:13.180
He tried to hand me
his ticket...

58:24.988 --> 58:26.748
Sorry about the delay,
Mr. Donovan.

58:26.843 --> 58:28.828
-That's all right, Mike.
-Excuse me, young man.

58:28.924 --> 58:30.747
My son dropped this.
All his money's in it.

58:30.844 --> 58:32.187
He just went on board.

58:32.283 --> 58:34.587
Blond hair, no hat,
camel's hair coat. I wonder-

58:34.684 --> 58:36.188
I'm not allowed to accept
a wallet.

58:36.284 --> 58:37.628
See the stewardess
about it, please.

58:37.724 --> 58:38.620
Oh.

59:25.564 --> 59:28.028
But, you see,
if someone is smuggling,

59:28.124 --> 59:30.589
they usually start
to get nervous when they land,

59:30.685 --> 59:33.469
not before they take off.
This guy was really shaky.

59:33.565 --> 59:35.229
If it's contraband
and he's a trembler,

59:35.325 --> 59:37.309
Italian customs will nail him.

59:37.405 --> 59:39.549
There's not much we can
do about it here.

59:39.644 --> 59:41.820
I don't know. I think
somebody ought to.

59:43.005 --> 59:44.509
Maybe you should
tell your boss,

59:44.604 --> 59:46.556
in case he wants
to notify the captain.

59:47.484 --> 59:50.141
I guess you're right.
Be right back.

59:55.485 --> 59:58.588
P. A.: Braniff International
flight 49 for Dallas...

59:58.685 --> 01:00:00.828
now boarding at gate 19,

01:00:00.924 --> 01:00:02.588
the red concourse.

01:00:02.684 --> 01:00:04.989
All passengers holding
confirmed reservations...

01:00:05.084 --> 01:00:09.213
please proceed to gate 19,
the red concourse.

01:00:48.604 --> 01:00:49.854
23B?

01:00:50.365 --> 01:00:52.092
Oh, yes. Right here.

01:01:10.046 --> 01:01:11.709
What are you doing here?

01:01:11.805 --> 01:01:13.054
She got away.

01:01:13.117 --> 01:01:14.270
She what?

01:01:14.365 --> 01:01:16.349
Well, what she did was-
we were-

01:01:16.445 --> 01:01:18.110
I don't care how she got away.

01:01:18.206 --> 01:01:20.349
Get on that phone
and call every airline.

01:01:20.445 --> 01:01:22.493
I'll see if security
can round her up.

01:01:27.165 --> 01:01:29.150
Forward jetway still in place.

01:01:29.245 --> 01:01:30.973
Your decision, Captain.

01:01:31.645 --> 01:01:33.054
Make some noise.

01:01:44.606 --> 01:01:45.630
Miss Meighen?

01:01:46.366 --> 01:01:48.190
Yes, Captain?

01:01:48.285 --> 01:01:49.630
What's the delay?

01:01:49.726 --> 01:01:51.517
The tourist head count
won't tally.

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:53.245
Where's the ramp supervisor?

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.295
-He's back there counting.
-Get him.

01:02:02.367 --> 01:02:04.158
The plane to Rome-
is it gone yet?

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:05.309
-No, but hurry.
-Which way?

01:02:05.405 --> 01:02:07.070
Go through there
and turn right.

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:09.374
-Green concourse, gate 33.
-Thank you.

01:02:11.518 --> 01:02:13.310
I know you got problems,
and so have we,

01:02:13.406 --> 01:02:15.006
but how long will we
sit here?

01:02:15.038 --> 01:02:16.511
I've just ordered
a ticket recheck.

01:02:16.606 --> 01:02:19.006
We should have 81.
It seems we've got 82.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.310
Every second, we're burning fuel
on three and four-

01:02:21.407 --> 01:02:23.070
which you gave the OK
to start-

01:02:23.166 --> 01:02:24.510
precious fuel
that we'll need tonight.

01:02:24.606 --> 01:02:25.630
I know, Captain, but-

01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:27.071
Unless this plane leaves
right now,

01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:28.191
I'm going to
shut everything down...

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:30.559
and send for fueling
to top off our tanks,

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:31.711
so make up your mind.

01:02:31.806 --> 01:02:33.695
It'll only take another
few minutes or so.

01:02:33.758 --> 01:02:34.910
And something else-

01:02:35.006 --> 01:02:36.831
the tower just told us
there's a temporary gap,

01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:39.711
so if we taxi out right away,
we could take off fast.

01:02:39.807 --> 01:02:41.950
But five minutes may mean
a half-hour delay,

01:02:42.046 --> 01:02:44.414
so you take the responsibility.
What do we do?

01:02:46.207 --> 01:02:47.710
Cancel that ticket recheck.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:49.118
OK. You're leaving now.

01:02:58.814 --> 01:03:00.575
May I see your ticket, please?

01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:05.854
Thank you.

01:03:06.687 --> 01:03:07.614
Ruth!

01:03:08.414 --> 01:03:10.494
Cancel the ticket check.
We're leaving.

01:03:11.326 --> 01:03:12.414
Fine.

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:21.375
C. B.: Commander, start two.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.215
Turning two.

01:03:31.647 --> 01:03:33.055
OKto start one?

01:03:47.327 --> 01:03:51.071
P. A.: Braniff International
flight 252 from Houston...

01:03:51.167 --> 01:03:53.151
now arriving at gate 10,

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:54.975
the red concourse.

01:03:58.686 --> 01:04:01.471
22, 23, 24, 25,

01:04:01.566 --> 01:04:05.311
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

01:04:05.406 --> 01:04:08.863
31, 32, 33, 34, 35-

01:04:08.927 --> 01:04:11.583
Excuse me. I'd like
to find out if the-

01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:13.663
my husband's on that flight
that left. I-

01:04:13.728 --> 01:04:16.223
I'm sorry. I'm not allowed to
give that information.

01:04:16.287 --> 01:04:17.823
He hasn't been well lately.

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:21.023
I just wanted to make sure
he got on board safely.

01:04:21.087 --> 01:04:22.656
His name is D. O. Guerrero.

01:04:23.487 --> 01:04:24.575
All right.

01:04:26.047 --> 01:04:27.775
Yes. He's aboard.

01:04:29.728 --> 01:04:34.623
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,

01:04:34.688 --> 01:04:38.655
25, 26, 27, 28, 29...

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.208
Life rafts are located in the
ceiling storage compartments.

01:05:30.272 --> 01:05:31.808
In addition to the doors,

01:05:31.872 --> 01:05:34.752
there are emergency exits
located over both wings.

01:05:34.816 --> 01:05:37.249
For more information
concerning these items,

01:05:37.312 --> 01:05:39.233
please look in the seat pocket
in front of you.

01:05:39.329 --> 01:05:42.400
We suggest you read it sometime
during the flight.

01:06:03.777 --> 01:06:05.408
Don't worry. If you take
one of these,

01:06:05.472 --> 01:06:06.849
you won't get airsick at all.

01:06:06.913 --> 01:06:08.256
Thank you, Doctor.

01:06:13.152 --> 01:06:15.456
Global two, Lincoln Tower.
You're clear for takeoff.

01:06:27.073 --> 01:06:28.800
Global two rolling.

01:06:57.153 --> 01:06:59.328
On top at 7,000.

01:06:59.393 --> 01:07:01.760
Clear above.
Visibility unlimited.

01:07:02.434 --> 01:07:05.793
Proceeding on course.
We'll report passing Cleveland.

01:07:11.713 --> 01:07:14.370
Now, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

01:07:14.433 --> 01:07:16.769
I've flown thousands of miles,
and I can tell you,

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:19.201
it's a lot safer
than crossing a street.

01:07:28.705 --> 01:07:31.169
P. A.:... now in the final stages
of departure...

01:07:31.265 --> 01:07:34.689
at gate 41-A,
the green concourse.

01:07:34.786 --> 01:07:36.769
Yeah, she was here.
I saw her go on.

01:07:36.865 --> 01:07:38.689
But did you see her get off?

01:07:38.785 --> 01:07:41.409
No, but I'm
almost certain she did.

01:07:41.506 --> 01:07:43.970
Her son dropped his wallet.
She went on to return it.

01:07:44.066 --> 01:07:46.657
The wallet gag.
She's on the plane.

01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:48.930
Maybe that's why the head count
didn't tally.

01:07:49.026 --> 01:07:51.617
Speaking of head counts,
have you counted yours lately?

01:07:51.649 --> 01:07:53.250
I'm sure you've got
at least two.

01:07:53.346 --> 01:07:55.810
Should I send word
to the captain to verify?

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:57.089
Yeah. Have
flight dispatch call...

01:07:57.186 --> 01:07:59.522
on the company frequency
to keep it private.

01:08:05.858 --> 01:08:09.090
Our ground speed
is 620 miles per hour.

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:12.545
We've reached our cruising
altitude of 33,000 feet,

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:13.890
and the temperature outside...

01:08:13.986 --> 01:08:17.057
is a pleasant
50 degrees below zero.

01:08:17.089 --> 01:08:20.609
Our route tonight will take us
over Toronto, Montreal,

01:08:20.706 --> 01:08:23.010
Cape Ray, St. John,
Newfoundland,

01:08:23.104 --> 01:08:24.290
across the Atlantic,

01:08:24.386 --> 01:08:27.296
reaching the European coastline
just north of Lisbon,

01:08:27.362 --> 01:08:29.090
and on into Rome
on schedule.

01:08:29.185 --> 01:08:31.328
The weather in Rome
is a lot better...

01:08:31.426 --> 01:08:33.506
than what we left behind
in Chicago.

01:08:33.537 --> 01:08:36.290
If there's anything we can do to
make your flight more enjoyable,

01:08:36.386 --> 01:08:38.082
please let us know.
Thank you.

01:08:43.426 --> 01:08:44.801
This is Global two.

01:08:44.898 --> 01:08:47.649
Flight two, Cleveland.
I have a message from Lincoln.

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:49.282
Advise when ready to copy.

01:08:50.946 --> 01:08:52.866
Go ahead, Cleveland.
We're ready.

01:08:52.898 --> 01:08:55.970
Practically certain
you have a stowaway on board-

01:08:56.066 --> 01:08:59.330
Caucasian... female...

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:01.921
approximately five feet,
100 pounds...

01:09:02.626 --> 01:09:04.611
age about 70...

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:07.649
wearing a brown hat
with a brown pompom,

01:09:07.747 --> 01:09:10.050
tweed coat with black
velvet collar.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:14.211
Name-Mrs. Ada Quonsett.
Determine and confirm.

01:09:14.305 --> 01:09:15.522
We'll check and advise.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:19.010
-I don't believe it.
-Oh, I believe it.

01:09:19.107 --> 01:09:21.506
Those penguins on the ground
are idiots.

01:09:27.426 --> 01:09:31.202
Now the guy in 21D
says it's too hot.

01:09:32.066 --> 01:09:33.442
You want a laugh?

01:09:34.627 --> 01:09:36.002
Have you seen her?

01:09:39.587 --> 01:09:41.091
Well, she's not in first.

01:09:41.185 --> 01:09:43.490
I've hardly checked
the tourist section yet.

01:09:43.587 --> 01:09:46.691
Well, go back and see
if the old biddy's there, huh?

01:09:46.787 --> 01:09:47.970
If so, what do I do?

01:09:48.067 --> 01:09:50.082
Nothing. Just come back
and report.

01:09:51.107 --> 01:09:53.890
How about that, huh?
Little old lady just walks on...

01:09:53.987 --> 01:09:55.523
like she's walking
into an elevator.

01:09:57.507 --> 01:09:58.563
Excuse me.

01:10:00.867 --> 01:10:01.923
There you are.

01:10:07.459 --> 01:10:10.210
WOMiss, the captain said
we'd arrive on schedule.

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:12.451
That means we'll make up
for the hour's delay.

01:10:12.547 --> 01:10:16.131
Father, with a ground speed
of 620 miles per hour

01:10:16.226 --> 01:10:19.171
and a distance of 4,817 miles,

01:10:19.267 --> 01:10:21.539
it's a physical impossibility.

01:10:21.603 --> 01:10:22.691
Your son is right.

01:10:22.788 --> 01:10:25.411
The captain was referring to
scheduled flying time.

01:10:25.507 --> 01:10:28.579
It will be approximately
71/2 hours from takeoff.

01:10:32.067 --> 01:10:33.283
Oh, excuse me.

01:10:38.787 --> 01:10:41.572
Oh, I see
you've got a boyfriend.

01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:44.163
Yes. He's invited me
to Rome to a nightclub.

01:10:48.707 --> 01:10:51.332
Miss! Miss!
These nuts are stale.

01:10:51.428 --> 01:10:53.892
I'm sorry. I'll try
and find you some fresher ones.

01:10:53.987 --> 01:10:56.932
$474, and they
give you stale nuts.

01:10:57.028 --> 01:10:59.331
So you play the oboe.

01:10:59.427 --> 01:11:01.411
My late husband played
the violin.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.812
Not professionally,
but he was very good.

01:11:03.907 --> 01:11:07.940
He once played the
"FMinute Waltz"F in 58 seconds.

01:11:07.971 --> 01:11:09.924
-There you are.
-Thank you so much.

01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:30.116
-Nuts to the man in 21D.
-You said it.

01:11:32.227 --> 01:11:34.052
May I treat you
to another sherry?

01:11:34.148 --> 01:11:36.452
Oh, no, really.
One is all I ever-

01:11:36.548 --> 01:11:39.076
Well, thank you.
You're very kind.

01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:47.236
She's there, all right. 23B.

01:11:47.908 --> 01:11:49.732
That's why the head count
was wrong.

01:11:49.828 --> 01:11:51.172
What should I do?

01:11:51.267 --> 01:11:53.892
Nothing. If you start
questioning her now,

01:11:53.989 --> 01:11:55.492
there's bound to be tears, and-

01:11:55.588 --> 01:11:57.892
We were asked to check
and report, that's all.

01:11:57.987 --> 01:12:00.292
They'll grab her in Rome,
so until then,

01:12:00.389 --> 01:12:02.531
why make the old girl miserable?

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.996
You know, Captain,
you're a real nice person.

01:12:05.828 --> 01:12:08.133
I didn't know you were
so fond of old women.

01:12:08.228 --> 01:12:11.012
-Oh, I prefer the younger ones.
-So I heard.

01:12:11.108 --> 01:12:13.733
But opportunities, you know,
don't last forever.

01:12:13.828 --> 01:12:15.332
Pretty soon,
we'll have to settle...

01:12:15.428 --> 01:12:16.613
for the not-so-young ones.

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:18.916
Well, I already have
for quite some time.

01:12:19.749 --> 01:12:22.213
That's right. You always played
it straight down the line.

01:12:22.309 --> 01:12:24.132
No mucking around on layovers.

01:12:24.228 --> 01:12:27.332
Ellen was a stewardess
flying DC-4s. That's how we met.

01:12:27.429 --> 01:12:30.053
She knew what was going on,
so when we got married,

01:12:30.148 --> 01:12:32.612
I made her a promise-
the obvious one.

01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:33.797
Always kept it.

01:12:34.788 --> 01:12:37.733
I guess all those kids
you had helped.

01:12:37.829 --> 01:12:39.076
Yeah. Maybe.

01:12:39.909 --> 01:12:42.053
-How many have you got? Six?
-No. Seven.

01:12:42.148 --> 01:12:44.709
Four we planned.
Three we didn't.

01:12:49.349 --> 01:12:52.772
The ones you didn't plan-
did you ever consider...

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.461
doing anything about them
before they were born?

01:12:55.556 --> 01:12:56.837
No.

01:12:58.468 --> 01:13:01.893
Let me tell you something.
I love all seven of them,

01:13:01.989 --> 01:13:04.452
but the three we didn't plan...

01:13:04.549 --> 01:13:07.301
boy, they turned out
to be something real special.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.476
Detain on board...

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:19.717
after landing.

01:13:20.869 --> 01:13:22.116
Release only...

01:13:23.429 --> 01:13:25.317
to station manager Roth.

01:13:28.389 --> 01:13:30.373
I'm going to flight dispatch.
I'll take it.

01:13:30.469 --> 01:13:32.262
I'll take it for you,
Mr. Weatherby.

01:13:32.357 --> 01:13:34.949
No, thank you. It'll wind up
in the ladies room.

01:13:34.981 --> 01:13:36.773
What about the man,
Mr. Weatherby,

01:13:36.869 --> 01:13:38.181
the one with the attaché case?

01:13:38.278 --> 01:13:40.294
If Standish wants to find out
what he's smuggling,

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:42.373
let him get Italian customs
to check.

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:43.813
I won't offend
a paying passenger...

01:13:43.909 --> 01:13:45.509
with something that's
none of our business.

01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:48.229
I was wondering, what if
he isn't smuggling? What if-

01:13:48.261 --> 01:13:49.637
Forget it.

01:13:53.509 --> 01:13:56.133
I'm sorry, Mrs. Livingston,
that he got mad at you.

01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:57.541
It was all my fault.

01:13:57.637 --> 01:13:59.717
Never mind.
He'll get over it.

01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:03.334
That man was one of the last
to go aboard,

01:14:03.429 --> 01:14:06.118
so he probably was on
that bus that was late.

01:14:11.749 --> 01:14:14.373
-Randall.
-John, this is Tanya Livingston.

01:14:14.469 --> 01:14:17.573
Do me a favor. Read me
the passengers on flight two...

01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:18.853
who came out on the bus.

01:14:18.949 --> 01:14:20.837
Yeah. Hang on.
I've got it right here.

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:26.373
Never mind the women.
Just the men.

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:29.317
OK. "FRathbone, Marcus J."F

01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:32.293
"FBinelli, Luigi. "F

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:34.277
"FGuerrero, D. O."F

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.870
"FYates, Robert. "F

01:14:36.902 --> 01:14:38.534
She stood us up, that's all.

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:39.654
I hope that's all.

01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:42.277
You or me?

01:14:43.109 --> 01:14:44.037
You.

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:50.023
Bakersfeld.

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:52.454
Your wife insisted
that I page you.

01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:54.341
She's waiting for you
in your office.

01:14:55.462 --> 01:14:56.678
Thanks.

01:15:04.549 --> 01:15:08.294
P. A.: Delta Air Lines flight 76
for Atlanta...

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:09.734
now departing at gate 12.

01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:12.295
Oh, Mrs. Livingston!
I'm sorry to bother you,

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:13.894
but one of my men
found this woman...

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:15.494
wandering aimlessly
about the terminal.

01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:17.286
Seems terribly upset
about something.

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:19.334
-She should see the doctor.
-She doesn't want to.

01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:20.614
I think what's worrying
her most...

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:22.982
is she has no money
to get back to town.

01:15:23.911 --> 01:15:25.093
I'd like to help, but-

01:15:25.191 --> 01:15:27.366
She let me go through her purse.
I thought I'd find...

01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:29.606
a little address book
or something, call somebody,

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:31.942
but there was nothing
in it but this.

01:15:32.039 --> 01:15:34.406
I thought since her husband
bought a ticket on Global,

01:15:34.471 --> 01:15:36.486
you might want
to give her bus fare.

01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:38.566
$5.00 would do it.

01:15:38.631 --> 01:15:41.478
You just take it easy, ma'am.
Everything will be fine.

01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:45.959
Guerrero.

01:15:47.718 --> 01:15:49.383
And we don't have
a home anymore.

01:15:49.445 --> 01:15:52.006
We have a waiting room,
where I walk the floor...

01:15:52.071 --> 01:15:54.086
and wonder whether you
will leave this damn airport...

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:56.166
long enough to drop by
for a few minutes!

01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:59.110
Why you have to pick tonight
to come and fight with me.

01:15:59.206 --> 01:16:01.926
I came here to tell you
that Roberta left home!

01:16:03.591 --> 01:16:06.247
What do you mean, left home?
When?

01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:09.286
I called from the banquet,
and I spoke to Libby.

01:16:09.351 --> 01:16:11.526
Roberta, she said, told her
that she couldn't stand...

01:16:11.591 --> 01:16:13.126
our fighting any longer,

01:16:13.191 --> 01:16:16.007
that she couldn't stand
the atmosphere of hate.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.406
And that's a direct quote.

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:20.487
Where is she? Did Libby say?

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:22.727
She's going to spend the night
at Sally Bolton's house.

01:16:22.791 --> 01:16:24.039
I spoke to her.

01:16:25.351 --> 01:16:27.559
Cindy, we can't do this
to the kids.

01:16:28.231 --> 01:16:31.527
We've got to call a truce,
even if it's a pretense.

01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:33.767
We've got to start being civil
to each other.

01:16:33.831 --> 01:16:35.847
And add hypocrisy
to the problem?

01:16:35.911 --> 01:16:38.087
They'd see through that.
That's not the answer.

01:16:38.152 --> 01:16:39.943
Well, we've got to do something.

01:16:40.038 --> 01:16:41.159
You're right.

01:16:41.992 --> 01:16:44.326
And the only answer
is a divorce.

01:16:45.191 --> 01:16:47.847
You think that will make them
feel more secure?

01:16:47.911 --> 01:16:49.479
A broken home?

01:16:49.543 --> 01:16:51.207
It's better to come
from a broken home...

01:16:51.271 --> 01:16:52.552
than to live in one.

01:16:54.951 --> 01:16:56.199
You may be right.

01:16:57.351 --> 01:16:59.399
And you may be right
about me, too.

01:17:00.072 --> 01:17:02.727
I'm suppose I'm like a lot
of men-a bigamist,

01:17:02.791 --> 01:17:05.607
married to both a woman
and a job.

01:17:05.672 --> 01:17:09.063
And I can't be number-two wife
any longer.

01:17:13.831 --> 01:17:15.207
Yes, Danny?

01:17:15.272 --> 01:17:17.287
Patroni wants a skip-loader.

01:17:17.352 --> 01:17:20.168
Get one from the lot.
We've got to get that plane out.

01:17:20.232 --> 01:17:23.847
And, Danny, keep 29 clean
so it'll be operational.

01:17:23.911 --> 01:17:26.888
That's what I mean. Those things
are more important than we are.

01:17:26.952 --> 01:17:29.927
No, not more important, but
at the moment, more imperative.

01:17:29.992 --> 01:17:32.071
We're in a hell of a mess.

01:17:32.104 --> 01:17:33.480
We certainly are.

01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:39.847
It's a big step, Cindy.

01:17:39.911 --> 01:17:42.279
Are you sure you don't want
to reconsider?

01:17:42.343 --> 01:17:44.968
No. It's too late, Mel.

01:17:45.031 --> 01:17:47.400
And it's not just the girls
I'm thinking of.

01:17:48.712 --> 01:17:51.560
There's someone else, Mel. There
has been for quite a while.

01:17:52.551 --> 01:17:55.239
Someone who makes me feel wanted
occasionally.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.207
You had no idea, had you?

01:18:00.904 --> 01:18:03.912
Too busy to even consider
the possibility.

01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:08.968
Mel? Mr. Bakersfeld, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

01:18:09.031 --> 01:18:11.208
Cindy, uh, Mrs. Livingston.
Mrs. Bakersfeld.

01:18:11.272 --> 01:18:13.288
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

01:18:13.351 --> 01:18:15.688
I have information on that man
with the attaché case.

01:18:15.752 --> 01:18:17.928
I'll talk to you about it
in a little while.

01:18:17.992 --> 01:18:19.080
Certainly.

01:18:24.392 --> 01:18:25.800
Are you sure?

01:18:26.633 --> 01:18:28.808
Are you really sure?

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:30.121
Yes.

01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:38.728
When we tell the children,
we must do it together.

01:18:38.792 --> 01:18:41.608
Of course, and I promise there
won't be any trouble.

01:18:41.672 --> 01:18:43.528
You may see the girls
as often as you wish.

01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:44.680
Thanks.

01:18:46.312 --> 01:18:49.161
As a matter of fact, you'll
probably see them more often.

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:53.161
Ex-husbands always seem to make
a special effort.

01:19:01.993 --> 01:19:03.049
Bakersfeld.

01:19:04.232 --> 01:19:05.768
Hang on a sec.

01:19:05.833 --> 01:19:08.808
Ned, I'll be right with you.

01:19:08.873 --> 01:19:11.368
OK, Hank. Go ahead.
Yes. That's all right.

01:19:11.433 --> 01:19:13.928
Put it in warehouse 12.
Well, get the trucks out.

01:19:13.993 --> 01:19:16.328
They're not supposed to
be blocking that area. Right.

01:19:17.513 --> 01:19:18.601
What's up, Ned?

01:19:19.592 --> 01:19:22.600
No, no, no, no.
Let the city police handle it.

01:19:30.953 --> 01:19:33.640
Now, you stay right here.
I'll just be a minute.

01:19:44.937 --> 01:19:46.409
The downtown terminal
said they remembered...

01:19:46.473 --> 01:19:47.688
a man
with an attaché case.

01:19:47.753 --> 01:19:49.738
They must have seen 10 men
with attaché cases.

01:19:49.801 --> 01:19:51.528
But this one held it
under his arm.

01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:53.609
When the agent tried
to put a tag on it,

01:19:53.673 --> 01:19:56.168
he pulled away and insisted on
putting it on himself.

01:19:56.233 --> 01:19:59.433
That's why they remembered him.
And it was Guerrero.

01:19:59.497 --> 01:20:01.609
I can't get anything
out of his wife,

01:20:01.674 --> 01:20:04.009
except a blank stare.

01:20:04.073 --> 01:20:06.089
Maybe you can make her talk.

01:20:06.153 --> 01:20:08.489
Please try. I have
a horrible feeling.

01:20:08.552 --> 01:20:09.737
All right. Bring her in.

01:20:12.392 --> 01:20:13.961
Mrs. Guerrero?

01:20:26.793 --> 01:20:28.041
She's gone.

01:20:33.354 --> 01:20:35.113
Hold it. Yes, sir?

01:20:35.177 --> 01:20:37.129
Remember the woman you
turned over to Mrs. Livingston?

01:20:37.194 --> 01:20:39.689
She's given us the slip. She's
probably still in the terminal.

01:20:39.753 --> 01:20:40.937
You've got to find her, Ned.

01:20:41.001 --> 01:20:42.762
We'll try. Will you
round up our boys?

01:20:42.857 --> 01:20:44.010
We'll announce from here.

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:45.801
You do it. I'll call
the insurance counter.

01:20:48.394 --> 01:20:50.762
-What's the security code?
-Lester Mean-Wearing.

01:20:53.833 --> 01:20:56.874
Attention, please.
Attention, please.

01:20:56.937 --> 01:20:59.242
For Mr. Lester Mean-Wearing's
party-

01:20:59.338 --> 01:21:00.521
Mr. Mean-Wearing requests...

01:21:00.618 --> 01:21:02.569
that all members
of his travel group...

01:21:02.633 --> 01:21:05.449
report immediately
to the main terminal entrance.

01:21:05.513 --> 01:21:07.562
To the main
terminal entrance.

01:21:09.033 --> 01:21:11.754
Yes. Here it is, Mr. Bakersfeld.

01:21:11.817 --> 01:21:16.234
"FD. O. Guerrero. "F
It's for 225,000.

01:21:17.994 --> 01:21:19.561
Yes, I remember him.

01:21:20.394 --> 01:21:23.177
Yes, sir.
He was a little nervous.

01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:25.930
Aside from that, did you notice
anything unusual about him?

01:21:25.994 --> 01:21:28.650
Well, just one thing.

01:21:28.714 --> 01:21:32.170
For somebody going to Europe, he
didn't seem to have much money.

01:21:32.234 --> 01:21:34.089
He paid me
with six $1.00 bills...

01:21:34.154 --> 01:21:37.130
and the rest in change,
mostly nickels and dimes.

01:21:37.193 --> 01:21:39.530
It seemed to be
just about all he had.

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:40.682
Thanks.

01:21:58.954 --> 01:22:02.730
You've been so busy, we just
haven't had a chance to chat.

01:22:02.794 --> 01:22:04.651
I'm Ada Quonsett.

01:22:04.714 --> 01:22:06.411
How do you do?

01:22:06.475 --> 01:22:08.202
What's your name, sir?

01:22:09.514 --> 01:22:10.763
Guerrero.

01:22:11.914 --> 01:22:13.803
Guerrero? That's Spanish,
isn't it?

01:22:14.955 --> 01:22:17.290
Yes, but way back.

01:22:17.354 --> 01:22:19.370
You look more Irish.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:21.003
So did my mother.

01:22:21.994 --> 01:22:23.691
I've been fascinated
by that figuring...

01:22:23.755 --> 01:22:24.970
you've been doing on the map.

01:22:25.034 --> 01:22:27.723
I said to Mr. Davidson
I was sure you would win.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.602
The contest.

01:22:31.435 --> 01:22:33.770
The one that comes the closest
to guessing...

01:22:33.834 --> 01:22:36.523
our time of arrival
wins a sightseeing trip.

01:22:37.515 --> 01:22:41.930
Oh, no. I didn't-no. I just
do this as sort of a hobby.

01:22:41.995 --> 01:22:44.170
I like to see if I can...

01:22:44.235 --> 01:22:46.411
calculate where we are
all the time.

01:22:46.474 --> 01:22:48.010
-Now, that's-
-If you'll excuse me,

01:22:48.075 --> 01:22:50.442
I think I'll take a little nap.

01:22:54.123 --> 01:22:57.931
"FApproach with extreme caution.
His seat assignment is 23A."F

01:22:57.995 --> 01:23:00.650
Have the dispatcher send it
on the company frequency-

01:23:00.715 --> 01:23:03.371
probably New York. They're out
of the Cleveland area by now.

01:23:03.434 --> 01:23:05.610
Maybe the man is just
an ordinary eccentric.

01:23:05.675 --> 01:23:07.851
Maybe all he's got in there
are important papers.

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.772
I don't think so. I wish I did.

01:23:09.835 --> 01:23:11.691
I have a niece
aboard that flight.

01:23:11.755 --> 01:23:13.611
All right. Suppose
he has got a bomb.

01:23:13.675 --> 01:23:15.211
They've been up there
over an hour.

01:23:15.307 --> 01:23:17.611
-Why hasn't he let it go?
-I don't know.

01:23:17.674 --> 01:23:20.332
Maybe he's waiting until they
get out over the ocean.

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:22.315
The Atlantic
doesn't leave traces.

01:23:24.907 --> 01:23:26.252
We just found
the Guerrero woman.

01:23:26.315 --> 01:23:27.979
One of my men is bringing her.

01:23:28.043 --> 01:23:29.932
Hold that call. We may
have something else.

01:23:29.995 --> 01:23:31.243
I'll call you right back.

01:23:32.459 --> 01:23:34.923
Now they say it's too cold.

01:23:44.107 --> 01:23:45.931
Oh, he has fainting spells.

01:23:46.027 --> 01:23:48.972
When he feels one coming on,
he takes a whiff of oxygen.

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:50.604
Sometimes it helps.

01:23:55.627 --> 01:24:00.011
Don't let him kid you.
It's an F. A. A. regulation.

01:24:00.108 --> 01:24:02.732
Over 25,000, if one of us leaves
the flight deck,

01:24:02.827 --> 01:24:05.612
the other one must go on oxygen.
It's just a precaution.

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:06.924
Thanks.

01:24:16.747 --> 01:24:19.531
Why didn't you ring?
I could have brought you that.

01:24:19.627 --> 01:24:21.611
Up there, I'd have to be formal.

01:24:21.708 --> 01:24:23.852
Up there, I couldn't
tell you, uh...

01:24:23.948 --> 01:24:26.251
how sorry I am.

01:24:26.348 --> 01:24:29.132
-How do you feel?
-I feel great, Vern.

01:24:29.228 --> 01:24:31.851
No fainting spells.
No craving for pickles.

01:24:31.947 --> 01:24:33.323
No morning sickness.

01:24:35.148 --> 01:24:38.252
It's funny. I didn't think
you were the kind of a guy...

01:24:38.348 --> 01:24:40.299
who would worry
about a thing like this.

01:24:40.364 --> 01:24:42.411
Neither did I.
You know, before,

01:24:42.507 --> 01:24:45.772
you said that you thought
I loved you just a little.

01:24:45.868 --> 01:24:49.644
You're wrong. I-I love you
a lot more than just a little.

01:25:06.828 --> 01:25:08.972
I didn't know
he was going to Rome.

01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:11.051
He said he was going
to Milwaukee.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:13.325
Here, Inez.
Take another sip of this.

01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:18.828
But this was in your purse.
You must have known.

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:22.412
It just came tonight, special.

01:25:22.509 --> 01:25:24.365
I only saw it after he left.

01:25:25.548 --> 01:25:27.404
Does your husband have business
in Italy?

01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:31.405
What is your husband's business?

01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:34.412
Oh, he's, uh, he was...

01:25:34.508 --> 01:25:37.932
he did excavations
for buildings.

01:25:38.029 --> 01:25:40.812
You've said "Fwas. "F He's not
in that business anymore?

01:25:40.909 --> 01:25:43.052
Things... went wrong.

01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:45.453
-Financial trouble?
-Yes.

01:25:45.549 --> 01:25:46.605
Bad trouble?

01:25:47.948 --> 01:25:49.004
Broke? In debt?

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.949
Then how did he pay
for his ticket?

01:25:53.069 --> 01:25:55.372
I think, uh...

01:25:55.468 --> 01:25:56.973
he pawned my mother's
wedding ring.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:26:00.172
When I looked tonight
in the case, it was empty.

01:26:00.268 --> 01:26:04.013
He-he just...

01:26:04.108 --> 01:26:06.253
can't seem to hold a job lately.

01:26:06.349 --> 01:26:07.534
Why not?

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:10.413
He gets in arguments.
They fire him.

01:26:10.509 --> 01:26:12.173
It's his temper.
He's been like that...

01:26:12.269 --> 01:26:14.284
ever since he got out
of the hospital.

01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:18.093
What sort of hospital?

01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:19.533
Army hospital.

01:26:19.628 --> 01:26:22.445
Yes, but, uh, I mean,
what was he in the hospital for?

01:26:24.589 --> 01:26:27.052
He, uh...

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.365
was sick.

01:26:33.068 --> 01:26:34.124
Mental patient?

01:26:35.213 --> 01:26:37.902
Mrs. Guerrero, what did
your husband do in the army?

01:26:38.989 --> 01:26:41.069
He was a demolition expert.

01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:45.934
And I suppose
in his excavation work,

01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:48.301
he used explosives?

01:26:50.829 --> 01:26:52.812
He, um...

01:26:52.909 --> 01:26:54.445
You were about to say something.

01:26:56.269 --> 01:27:01.453
His last job-they fired him.
Something...

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:04.173
was missing.
Some dynamite.

01:27:06.094 --> 01:27:08.109
What we need is
an unlisted number.

01:27:11.021 --> 01:27:12.206
This is Global two.

01:27:12.301 --> 01:27:15.246
Global two, New York. We have
an important message for you.

01:27:15.342 --> 01:27:16.717
Advise when ready to copy.

01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:22.029
OK, New York. Go ahead.

01:27:22.062 --> 01:27:23.630
Strong probability-

01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:25.806
repeat, strong
probability exists...

01:27:25.902 --> 01:27:31.213
that passenger D. O. Guerrero,
seat assignment 23A,

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:34.670
may have an explosive device
in attaché-type briefcase.

01:27:34.701 --> 01:27:37.550
Passenger purchased
excessive insurance,

01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:40.269
mentally disturbed,
and desperate.

01:27:40.302 --> 01:27:42.158
Approach with extreme caution.

01:27:42.222 --> 01:27:46.254
Right. Tell him another section
of 3-by-12s laid crosswise.

01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:48.334
Will do.
They need you?

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.734
No. It won't be ready to drive
for a half-hour.

01:27:50.829 --> 01:27:53.261
Ingram knows what to do
in the meantime. OK.

01:27:53.357 --> 01:27:56.141
So we know the kook
is sitting in 23A. That's here.

01:27:56.173 --> 01:27:58.094
That's right.
What's your opinion?

01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:01.262
My opinion is they should get
back here as fast as they can.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:05.102
If he lets go, could the plane
stand the explosion?

01:28:05.742 --> 01:28:08.270
We got one break-he's not
sitting in an aisle seat,

01:28:08.302 --> 01:28:11.054
so first, it'll blow out
a hunk of the fuselage here.

01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:13.358
What kind of structural damage
would that cause?

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:15.374
There's nothing but skin
on the sides.

01:28:15.471 --> 01:28:17.038
All the control cables run here,

01:28:17.102 --> 01:28:20.398
so if it's not too big a hole,
she might still fly,

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:23.470
but the sudden decompression
at 30,000 feet...

01:28:23.503 --> 01:28:25.679
is something you got to see
to believe.

01:28:25.742 --> 01:28:29.294
-He'll get sucked out, won't he?
-So will anybody next to him.

01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:30.798
Until that pressure equalizes,

01:28:30.862 --> 01:28:33.711
everything within 20 feet of him
that's not nailed down...

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:35.502
is going to get sucked out.

01:28:35.598 --> 01:28:37.358
Is it that powerful?
Are you sure?

01:28:37.422 --> 01:28:40.014
Huh. Yeah, I'm sure.

01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:43.055
As a mechanic in the Air Force,

01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:44.815
I was being transferred
on a MATS plane.

01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:47.790
At 20,000 feet,
one of the windows shattered.

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:50.574
The guy sitting next to it
was about 170 pounds.

01:28:50.671 --> 01:28:54.255
He went through that space like
hamburger going down a disposal.

01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:58.671
Right after him, coats, pillows,
blankets, cups, saucers...

01:28:58.702 --> 01:28:59.951
yeah, I'm sure.

01:28:59.983 --> 01:29:02.159
Takes about three seconds,
doesn't it?

01:29:02.222 --> 01:29:04.398
Three, four, five.
Depends on the size of the hole.

01:29:04.463 --> 01:29:07.663
Everything fogs up just
like that, and then, watch out.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:09.103
That altitude,
you can't breathe,

01:29:09.134 --> 01:29:13.230
so unless they get on oxygen
in 45 seconds, it's good-bye.

01:29:31.503 --> 01:29:34.831
We'll turn back, but I'm
going to make a wide, slow turn.

01:29:34.863 --> 01:29:36.783
That way, the passengers
might not notice.

01:29:38.383 --> 01:29:40.239
Toronto Center,
this is Global two.

01:29:40.304 --> 01:29:42.064
Seem to have a problem here.

01:29:42.159 --> 01:29:44.943
Request clearance back
to Lincoln at a lower altitude.

01:29:45.039 --> 01:29:47.855
Roger, Global two.
Turn left, heading 2-7-0.

01:29:47.951 --> 01:29:50.831
Descend and maintain
flight level 2-8-0.

01:29:50.864 --> 01:29:52.431
Are you declaring an emergency?

01:29:52.495 --> 01:29:54.959
Possible emergency. We might
have a disturbed passenger.

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:59.311
There's no mistake.
He's in 23A.

01:29:59.375 --> 01:30:02.576
-Fits the description perfectly.
-When did you see him?

01:30:02.671 --> 01:30:04.111
When I was boarding
Mrs. Quonsett.

01:30:04.175 --> 01:30:05.775
He's sitting right next to her.

01:30:05.871 --> 01:30:07.472
Did you notice
the attaché case?

01:30:07.503 --> 01:30:09.775
It's on his lap,
and he won't put it down.

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:12.175
Ruth told me that when
she was serving the snacks,

01:30:12.271 --> 01:30:14.192
he wouldn't use
the pull-down table.

01:30:14.255 --> 01:30:17.135
He insisted on putting his tray
on top of his case.

01:30:17.231 --> 01:30:19.056
Sounds as if that's
where he's got it.

01:30:19.152 --> 01:30:22.223
Then he must have a trigger
on the outside of the case.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.559
Is anyone sitting on the other
side of the old lady?

01:30:24.623 --> 01:30:25.552
A man.

01:30:26.991 --> 01:30:30.159
Then I'd have to lean over two
people. I couldn't surprise him.

01:30:31.503 --> 01:30:33.200
OK if I go take a look?

01:30:33.263 --> 01:30:36.592
Sure. Not too close a look.
He might suspect something.

01:30:36.623 --> 01:30:37.711
No.

01:30:39.344 --> 01:30:43.312
I'll do one of those smiling,
good evening walk-throughs.

01:30:43.375 --> 01:30:46.000
If anybody catches the fact
that we're turning around,

01:30:46.064 --> 01:30:47.376
I'll give some double-talk.

01:30:49.552 --> 01:30:51.344
Toronto Center,
Global two starting to turn.

01:30:51.375 --> 01:30:53.424
Would like to make it
wide and gradual.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.600
Global two, wide turn approved.

01:30:55.663 --> 01:30:58.000
Will alert other sectors
to your problem.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.567
So delay serving dinner.

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.936
Put every bottle, cup, glass,
and everything else away...

01:31:14.032 --> 01:31:15.055
and lock it up.

01:31:15.151 --> 01:31:16.624
Right. Be careful, Vernon.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.416
All right. I'll tell the girls
in tourist.

01:31:28.113 --> 01:31:31.504
Oh. Oh, Captain. Our son
has a question to ask you.

01:31:31.601 --> 01:31:33.584
Schuyler, here's our captain.

01:31:33.681 --> 01:31:36.432
Before, Virgo and Leo
were right there, sir.

01:31:36.465 --> 01:31:39.792
Now I'm beginning to see
Ursa Minor and Cassiopeia.

01:31:39.824 --> 01:31:41.968
We must be turning around.

01:31:42.032 --> 01:31:44.784
You have
a young navigator here.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.144
I'll tell you, son,
due to a setzle wind,

01:31:48.208 --> 01:31:51.984
distors vexered us into
a 360 tarsan of slower traffic.

01:31:52.081 --> 01:31:54.225
We'll maintain
this borton hold...

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:57.040
until we get fortomagnus
clearance from Malnix.

01:31:57.904 --> 01:31:59.984
Oh. Yes, of course.

01:32:04.049 --> 01:32:06.609
What did he mean by that, son?

01:32:06.672 --> 01:32:08.593
Never mind, Father.
I'll tell you later.

01:32:10.832 --> 01:32:11.921
Enjoying your trip?

01:32:11.984 --> 01:32:14.128
Very much. I was telling
my wife how smooth it is.

01:32:14.192 --> 01:32:16.369
A little while ago,
I put my drink on the armrest,

01:32:16.433 --> 01:32:17.745
and there wasn't even a ripple.

01:32:17.808 --> 01:32:18.864
Didn't lose a drop.

01:32:23.824 --> 01:32:26.160
-Hi, girls.
-Slumming, Captain?

01:32:26.225 --> 01:32:28.081
-No. We got some
bumpy weather ahead,

01:32:28.145 --> 01:32:29.809
so don't serve dinner yet.

01:32:29.873 --> 01:32:31.345
Keep everything in the drawers.

01:32:31.441 --> 01:32:32.369
OK.

01:32:33.264 --> 01:32:35.281
Doug, are you getting
plane-to-ground direct?

01:32:35.344 --> 01:32:36.400
Affirmative.

01:32:36.465 --> 01:32:38.961
They've turned around
and started a slow descent.

01:32:39.024 --> 01:32:40.561
What's the frequency?

01:32:40.625 --> 01:32:42.384
132.0.

01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:48.432
I'm sorry to have to
put this on you,

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:51.953
but if I go back there a second
time, he might get suspicious.

01:32:52.049 --> 01:32:54.481
Don't worry.
I think I can handle it.

01:33:08.273 --> 01:33:11.313
Excuse me, madam.
May I see your ticket?

01:33:11.345 --> 01:33:12.913
My ticket?

01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:14.929
That nice young man at the gate
took it.

01:33:14.993 --> 01:33:16.242
He wouldn't do that.

01:33:17.233 --> 01:33:18.609
If it was a round-trip ticket,

01:33:18.674 --> 01:33:20.434
you still have
the return flight coupon.

01:33:20.465 --> 01:33:24.145
If it was one-way, you have the
ticket stub and boarding folder.

01:33:24.242 --> 01:33:25.809
You're English, aren't you?

01:33:25.873 --> 01:33:28.913
I knew it the moment
you started to talk.

01:33:29.009 --> 01:33:31.570
You make our language sound
so delightful.

01:33:31.633 --> 01:33:33.426
-My late husband said-
-Never mind what he said.

01:33:33.522 --> 01:33:34.865
What about your ticket?

01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:37.041
I'll look, dear, but I'm sure-

01:33:37.106 --> 01:33:39.953
Why don't you stop
wasting my time, Mrs. Quonsett?

01:33:40.050 --> 01:33:42.706
You are Mrs. Ada Quonsett,
aren't you?

01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:44.754
Since you're aware
of who I am,

01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:46.225
there's no use denying it,
is there?

01:33:46.321 --> 01:33:48.305
If there's some
misunderstanding, I can help.

01:33:48.402 --> 01:33:50.929
There's no misunderstanding.
Are you traveling with her?

01:33:50.993 --> 01:33:52.049
No.

01:33:52.114 --> 01:33:53.586
Then it's not your business.

01:33:53.682 --> 01:33:55.889
This woman is a stowaway.

01:33:55.953 --> 01:33:57.745
Are we going to turn back?

01:33:57.842 --> 01:33:59.313
You're not that important.

01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:02.066
When we land in Rome, you'll be
handed over to the authorities.

01:34:02.130 --> 01:34:05.073
Come with me. The captain
has to make a report on you,

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:08.305
but first he'd like to see you.
Let this lady out, please.

01:34:08.402 --> 01:34:11.666
-The captain wants to see me?
-He doesn't like to wait.

01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:13.426
Don't treat her
like a criminal.

01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:14.866
That's what she is.

01:34:16.114 --> 01:34:17.905
Shoving an old lady
like that!

01:34:17.970 --> 01:34:19.442
I've never seen the like.

01:34:34.866 --> 01:34:35.954
Mrs. Quonsett,

01:34:35.986 --> 01:34:38.130
I'm Captain Demerest.
This is Captain Harris.

01:34:38.194 --> 01:34:40.306
Would you come forward
as far as you can?

01:34:43.346 --> 01:34:44.786
Oh, Captain-

01:34:44.883 --> 01:34:47.091
Please sit down, Mrs. Quonsett.

01:34:47.154 --> 01:34:48.851
I'm sorry to be
a trouble to you,

01:34:48.914 --> 01:34:52.050
but I was going to New York
to visit my poor daughter-

01:34:52.113 --> 01:34:54.067
Why'd you
get on this flight?

01:34:54.163 --> 01:34:56.210
Because according to the schedule,

01:34:56.275 --> 01:34:59.283
the next flight back from Rome
is to New York-your number 5-

01:34:59.346 --> 01:35:01.587
and I thought they'd want
to get rid of me quickly,

01:35:01.682 --> 01:35:03.250
so they'd put me on that plane.

01:35:03.315 --> 01:35:05.714
If you help us,
I promise you,

01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:08.850
you'll get to take trips
to New York, first class.

01:35:08.915 --> 01:35:12.242
Oh. Thank you.
But how can I help?

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:15.154
Mrs. Quonsett, now,
whatever happened back there,

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.554
you can forget. That's not why
you were brought here.

01:35:18.386 --> 01:35:20.434
Mrs. Quonsett,
I hope I didn't hurt you.

01:35:20.531 --> 01:35:23.794
No, no... not much.

01:35:23.827 --> 01:35:26.099
Are you frightened easily?

01:35:26.163 --> 01:35:27.315
No.

01:35:27.379 --> 01:35:30.770
I get nervous sometimes,
but not as much as I used to.

01:35:30.835 --> 01:35:33.683
When you get older, there isn't
a lot left to be frightened of.

01:35:33.778 --> 01:35:38.291
Good. All right, now...
you listen very carefully.

01:35:38.354 --> 01:35:40.274
C. B.: Global two,
this is Toronto Center.

01:35:40.371 --> 01:35:43.475
Your position is 15 miles east
of Klineberg intersection.

01:35:43.539 --> 01:35:44.691
Say altitude.

01:35:44.755 --> 01:35:48.050
Level at 2-8-0.
Request continued slow descent.

01:35:48.115 --> 01:35:50.451
Roger, Global two.
What altitude do you wish?

01:35:50.515 --> 01:35:54.035
-Request flight level 2-1-0.
-Roger. Continue slow descent.

01:35:54.099 --> 01:35:56.979
Maintain flight level 2-1-0.

01:35:57.043 --> 01:35:59.443
Mel, I just talked
to the other commissioners,

01:35:59.539 --> 01:36:01.331
and they all agree with me.

01:36:01.394 --> 01:36:03.955
So as not to have more trouble
with Meadowood residents,

01:36:04.019 --> 01:36:08.083
I'm instructing you to shut
the airport down until 7 a. m.

01:36:12.019 --> 01:36:13.875
Read this...

01:36:13.939 --> 01:36:15.475
dispatch we just sent.

01:36:15.571 --> 01:36:18.579
The plane's on its way back.
You still want us to shut down?

01:36:19.859 --> 01:36:22.291
Under the circumstances,
I, uh, I...

01:36:26.419 --> 01:36:28.371
Global two,
this is Toronto Center.

01:36:28.435 --> 01:36:29.715
Continue slow descent.

01:36:32.692 --> 01:36:34.739
Whatever she's done,
you don't have to be so rough.

01:36:34.803 --> 01:36:35.892
Don't interfere.

01:36:41.298 --> 01:36:42.835
Ask the captain to reconsider.

01:36:42.931 --> 01:36:45.684
I don't want to be handed over
to the Italian police!

01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:47.795
It's too late. Get in your seat.

01:36:47.892 --> 01:36:49.684
All I ask is to be sent back.

01:36:49.779 --> 01:36:52.339
Please, don't hand me over
in a foreign country.

01:36:52.404 --> 01:36:55.475
-Can't you see she's upset?
-I told you to keep out of this.

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.012
Sit down and be quiet.

01:36:57.075 --> 01:36:59.091
You hurt me! You hurt me.

01:36:59.156 --> 01:37:00.819
Stop it!
You're hysterical.

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:05.076
Oh, help me! Please, help me.
Help me!

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:07.123
No! No.

01:37:08.084 --> 01:37:10.740
That's his personal
property. You can't take it!

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:17.204
No! No!
You stay where you are!

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.220
Don't try to get any closer.

01:37:21.619 --> 01:37:24.819
Guerrero,
listen to me. Do you hear me?

01:37:24.884 --> 01:37:26.675
Listen.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.140
They know about you
on the ground.

01:37:29.172 --> 01:37:30.804
Your insurance is no good.

01:37:31.891 --> 01:37:33.940
It's canceled. It's worthless.

01:37:34.003 --> 01:37:36.276
No one has ever gotten away
with a thing like this.

01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.195
No one has collected a penny.

01:37:40.276 --> 01:37:42.900
You won't help your family.
You'll only hurt them.

01:37:42.964 --> 01:37:46.292
You'll kill yourself for nothing
if you explode that bomb.

01:37:46.356 --> 01:37:47.604
Stay where you are!

01:37:49.012 --> 01:37:51.732
Your family will be
hounded and blamed.

01:37:51.796 --> 01:37:52.981
Listen to me. Think.

01:37:54.676 --> 01:37:57.941
Guerrero, let these people
sit down, and we'll talk.

01:38:00.852 --> 01:38:04.019
I promise, until you're ready,
no one will come close.

01:38:07.572 --> 01:38:08.885
Sit down, please.

01:38:12.756 --> 01:38:15.380
Guerrero, you know now
that you've failed.

01:38:19.797 --> 01:38:23.892
The only way you can help your
family is to give me that case.

01:38:25.716 --> 01:38:27.060
Give me the case.

01:38:29.812 --> 01:38:33.141
If you do, I promise, no one
on this plane will hurt you.

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.932
Grab him! He's got a bomb!

01:39:29.653 --> 01:39:31.061
Get on oxygen!

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:36.533
Mayday! Mayday!

01:40:08.821 --> 01:40:13.045
Trans Global two. Decompression.
Making emergency descent.

01:40:20.022 --> 01:40:22.134
Request 10,000.

01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:24.566
Roger. Descend
and maintain 10,000.

01:40:24.661 --> 01:40:26.549
Report your intentions
when ready.

01:41:12.502 --> 01:41:14.006
Global two, Toronto Center.

01:41:14.102 --> 01:41:17.814
We're level at 10,000.
Returning to heading 2-7-0.

01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:21.367
We have damage due to explosion.
Extent unknown.

01:41:23.287 --> 01:41:24.886
Turn on all the heat you've got.

01:41:26.966 --> 01:41:28.374
Can we maintain control?

01:41:28.502 --> 01:41:29.591
The rudder's heavy,

01:41:29.654 --> 01:41:31.767
and the stabilizer trim
won't respond,

01:41:31.862 --> 01:41:34.070
but at least
the tail didn't fall off.

01:41:34.102 --> 01:41:36.374
-Where'd he pull the trigger?
-In the starboard can.

01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:39.510
Go back and check the damage
and report by interphone.

01:41:39.543 --> 01:41:41.814
According to the manifest,
there's three doctors aboard.

01:41:41.911 --> 01:41:43.126
Let's hope
they're not dentists.

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:44.534
They're probably
pitching in already.

01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:46.006
Get anybody else
that can help.

01:41:46.871 --> 01:41:48.727
And find out about Gwen.

01:41:53.143 --> 01:41:56.023
WOI'm so cold.
I'm terribly cold.

01:41:57.431 --> 01:41:59.830
Put him on the walk-around.
I'm cutting off the oxygen.

01:41:59.863 --> 01:42:00.823
All right.

01:42:08.695 --> 01:42:10.615
You can breathe normally.
You can take off the masks.

01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:12.150
Fasten your seat belts.

01:42:12.951 --> 01:42:14.007
Fasten your seat belts.

01:42:19.383 --> 01:42:20.950
Fasten your seat belts.

01:42:24.534 --> 01:42:26.903
Stewardess, if there's any
brandy on board, pass it out.

01:42:27.927 --> 01:42:30.550
Are you a doctor?
Yes, sister.

01:42:30.615 --> 01:42:31.831
Press that hard.

01:42:33.943 --> 01:42:35.223
Are you all right?

01:42:36.055 --> 01:42:37.974
-May I help you?
-I'm all right, thank you.

01:42:38.071 --> 01:42:39.671
Take care of that man behind me.

01:42:47.383 --> 01:42:49.687
-How is her pulse, sister?
-Weak.

01:42:50.551 --> 01:42:53.976
I have some adrenaline syringes.
Would you prepare a shot?

01:42:56.695 --> 01:42:57.783
Will it hold?

01:42:57.847 --> 01:43:00.247
SECOND After I get
this blanket wedged in here.

01:43:14.551 --> 01:43:15.447
Joan.

01:43:16.983 --> 01:43:19.096
As soon as they're patched up,
move them forward.

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:21.976
Stow the center armrests.
Put four people in three seats.

01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:23.032
Right.

01:43:28.984 --> 01:43:30.392
Go ahead.

01:43:30.423 --> 01:43:32.824
The hole's about
three to four feet.

01:43:32.855 --> 01:43:35.384
What about control surfaces?
Can you see anything?

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:37.112
Possible damage to rudder power,

01:43:37.176 --> 01:43:39.544
and it looks like
we have stabilizer problems.

01:43:39.576 --> 01:43:41.720
Most of the glass, thank God,
went sideways.

01:43:41.783 --> 01:43:43.864
Can we stay in the air an hour?

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:46.744
Hard to tell. There's a tear
in the ceiling from the hole...

01:43:46.839 --> 01:43:48.696
over to the port side.

01:43:48.792 --> 01:43:50.712
Think there's a rupture
in the outer skin?

01:43:50.776 --> 01:43:52.599
I don't know. Could be.

01:43:52.664 --> 01:43:54.040
What about the passengers?

01:43:55.704 --> 01:43:57.143
I can't say anything definite.

01:43:57.176 --> 01:43:58.904
I checked
the structural damage first,

01:43:58.936 --> 01:44:01.336
but what I did see
was less than I expected-

01:44:01.432 --> 01:44:04.152
some cuts and bruises
and shock and puking.

01:44:04.183 --> 01:44:05.496
Medical help good.

01:44:05.591 --> 01:44:07.576
I'm going to cut off
the passenger oxygen.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.231
How's Gwen?

01:44:11.481 --> 01:44:15.000
Pretty bad shape.
The doctor's working on her.

01:44:15.064 --> 01:44:16.697
I'll report when I can.

01:44:16.793 --> 01:44:18.905
Sounds like the break
is this side of the tail.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.432
Better sit down
as fast as we can, if we can.

01:44:21.496 --> 01:44:22.424
Right.

01:44:24.983 --> 01:44:26.616
Toronto Center, Global two.

01:44:26.712 --> 01:44:28.312
Have structural damage.

01:44:28.376 --> 01:44:31.351
Would like to land
nearest available airport.

01:44:31.384 --> 01:44:33.017
Global two, Toronto Center.

01:44:33.112 --> 01:44:34.936
Everything east of Lincoln
on your course...

01:44:35.033 --> 01:44:37.976
is closed due to weather
or field conditions.

01:44:38.071 --> 01:44:41.560
However, if you are declaring
an emergency, Detroit possible.

01:44:42.744 --> 01:44:45.176
They report five inches
of snow over ice,

01:44:45.272 --> 01:44:46.745
but they will try to clear.

01:44:48.825 --> 01:44:51.992
Request detour. Stand by in
case of any change in condition.

01:44:52.024 --> 01:44:53.561
We'll try for Lincoln.

01:44:53.624 --> 01:44:54.937
Roger, Global two.

01:44:55.032 --> 01:45:00.152
You are leaving my area.
Contact Cleveland Center, 117.5.

01:45:00.185 --> 01:45:01.241
Good luck.

01:45:02.393 --> 01:45:03.544
Roger, Toronto.

01:45:06.585 --> 01:45:10.360
Cleveland Center,
Global two on your frequency.

01:45:10.425 --> 01:45:13.816
Global two, this is
Cleveland Center. Radar contact.

01:45:13.912 --> 01:45:17.336
Turn right, heading 2-8-0.
Maintain 10,000.

01:45:17.432 --> 01:45:21.465
Lincoln weather: sky obscured,
visibility 1 mile, blowing snow.

01:45:21.561 --> 01:45:23.993
Runway two-niner still closed.

01:45:24.024 --> 01:45:28.025
But we have control damage which
makes landing on 29 imperative.

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:30.776
-Repeat: imperative!
-Roger, Global two.

01:45:30.872 --> 01:45:33.145
We'll relay your condition
and request.

01:45:33.176 --> 01:45:34.936
Keep monitoring.
I'll be in Mobile One.

01:45:35.032 --> 01:45:36.057
If there's any change, call me.

01:45:36.153 --> 01:45:39.001
Global two,
this is Cleveland Center.

01:45:39.065 --> 01:45:41.817
All eyeglasses off.
Eyeglasses off.

01:45:41.913 --> 01:45:43.705
All eyeglasses off.

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:45.433
Take off your eyeglasses

01:45:45.466 --> 01:45:48.281
and return your seats
to their upright position.

01:45:48.346 --> 01:45:50.265
Take off your eyeglasses

01:45:50.361 --> 01:45:52.921
and return your seats
to their upright position.

01:46:16.344 --> 01:46:19.225
The captain deliberately
struck me across the face!

01:46:19.322 --> 01:46:22.938
Unless you shut up, the second
officer's going to do the same.

01:46:23.033 --> 01:46:24.921
Is there anything
I can do to help?

01:46:26.265 --> 01:46:29.561
Yes, Father. I'm putting you
in charge of praying.

01:46:29.626 --> 01:46:32.154
If that's an order,
you're 30 minutes too late, son.

01:46:34.713 --> 01:46:36.793
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Demerest.

01:46:36.825 --> 01:46:39.962
I want to thank you for moving
forward in an orderly manner.

01:46:40.025 --> 01:46:41.881
I think it'll be
warmer for you this way,

01:46:41.946 --> 01:46:45.113
and it'll help us in controlling
the plane during landing.

01:46:45.145 --> 01:46:47.801
You know we've all had trouble,
bad trouble.

01:46:47.866 --> 01:46:50.265
I won't attempt to minimize it,

01:46:50.361 --> 01:46:52.506
but we've all gone through
an experience...

01:46:52.537 --> 01:46:54.297
that none of us
has ever had before,

01:46:54.393 --> 01:46:57.466
and thank God
we have come through.

01:46:57.562 --> 01:46:59.258
We have the airplane
under control.

01:46:59.354 --> 01:47:02.234
We estimate landing
in about 25 minutes.

01:47:02.266 --> 01:47:05.913
I won't kid you-we still have
a few problems ahead of us.

01:47:05.946 --> 01:47:08.762
Now, there are two thoughts
that should comfort you.

01:47:08.826 --> 01:47:11.418
First, you're in one of
the best-constructed planes...

01:47:11.514 --> 01:47:12.954
that there is.

01:47:12.985 --> 01:47:16.793
Second... tonight, instead of
one experienced captain,

01:47:16.825 --> 01:47:19.738
you have two-
Captain Harris and myself.

01:47:19.834 --> 01:47:23.002
Between us, we have more
flying years than we...

01:47:23.066 --> 01:47:25.050
I'm giving you
something for the pain,

01:47:25.114 --> 01:47:27.227
but don't move your head.

01:47:27.323 --> 01:47:28.890
Later on,
Second Officer Jordon...

01:47:28.954 --> 01:47:30.906
will give you instructions
on landing procedure.

01:47:31.002 --> 01:47:34.074
Please do exactly as he says,
and I promise you,

01:47:34.105 --> 01:47:36.570
we'll all come through this
together safely.

01:47:36.633 --> 01:47:37.562
Thank you.

01:47:52.154 --> 01:47:53.594
Global two, Cleveland Center.

01:47:53.690 --> 01:47:56.602
Lincoln advises runway two-niner
still closed.

01:47:56.666 --> 01:47:59.034
They are attempting to clear,
but failing that,

01:47:59.131 --> 01:48:00.762
plan landing on 22.

01:48:02.267 --> 01:48:03.195
Roger.

01:48:06.491 --> 01:48:08.826
-Want me to take over a while?
-Yeah, thanks.

01:48:19.867 --> 01:48:21.755
Ground, Mobile One.

01:48:21.786 --> 01:48:23.707
Yes, Mel?

01:48:23.771 --> 01:48:26.843
Tell the chief to take position
between runway 29 and 22...

01:48:26.906 --> 01:48:28.411
so they can move either way.

01:48:28.474 --> 01:48:30.042
We'll notify which runway later.

01:48:30.107 --> 01:48:31.162
Roger.

01:48:37.275 --> 01:48:39.771
Turn left, heading 2-0-5.

01:48:39.835 --> 01:48:42.395
At pilot's discretion,
descend and maintain 6,000.

01:48:42.491 --> 01:48:44.442
Report leaving 10,000.

01:48:45.146 --> 01:48:47.131
Global two turning left,
heading 2-0-5,

01:48:47.195 --> 01:48:49.083
leaving 10,000 now.

01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:56.251
Mr. Jordan said you wanted
to see me again, Captain.

01:48:56.315 --> 01:48:57.755
We radioed ahead,

01:48:57.850 --> 01:48:59.643
and they'll have all the
equipment that you asked for.

01:48:59.706 --> 01:49:02.107
Oh, good.
You'd better call again.

01:49:02.203 --> 01:49:05.306
Ask the airport doctor to have
an ophthalmic surgeon stand by.

01:49:06.747 --> 01:49:08.987
-For Miss Meighen?
-Yes.

01:49:09.084 --> 01:49:10.970
Besides the other injuries
I mentioned,

01:49:11.035 --> 01:49:13.211
I'm afraid her right eye
has splinters.

01:49:13.276 --> 01:49:15.771
Whether they're wood or metal,
I have no way of knowing.

01:49:15.834 --> 01:49:18.588
Her left eye, as far
as I can tell, is unharmed.

01:49:18.651 --> 01:49:21.530
Of course, it's too early
to draw conclusions.

01:49:21.595 --> 01:49:24.252
Modern ophthalmic surgery
can do extraordinary things.

01:49:24.314 --> 01:49:25.692
I'd better get back to her-

01:49:25.755 --> 01:49:27.451
Doctor?

01:49:27.515 --> 01:49:31.995
Gwen-Miss Meighen-
she's pregnant.

01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:33.531
Does that make a difference?

01:49:33.595 --> 01:49:34.523
I had no way of knowing.

01:49:34.587 --> 01:49:36.731
Her pregnancy can't be
very far advanced.

01:49:36.795 --> 01:49:38.011
No, it isn't.

01:49:38.076 --> 01:49:41.212
She wasn't deprived of oxygen
long enough to harm the child.

01:49:41.275 --> 01:49:42.588
No one was.

01:49:43.835 --> 01:49:46.651
If there are no abdominal
injuries and she survives,

01:49:46.715 --> 01:49:50.044
chances are good that the baby
should be born normally.

01:49:55.356 --> 01:49:56.571
Global two leaving 8,000.

01:49:56.636 --> 01:49:59.131
Advise Lincoln doctor to have
ophthalmic surgeon available.

01:49:59.196 --> 01:50:02.012
Roger, Global two.
Will notify.

01:50:02.076 --> 01:50:03.323
I'll take over now.

01:50:06.075 --> 01:50:10.012
Vern, I guess you know
how badly I feel about Gwen.

01:50:10.076 --> 01:50:12.892
What's between you two,
that's none of my business,

01:50:12.956 --> 01:50:14.748
but if there's anything
I can do as a friend...

01:50:16.956 --> 01:50:18.365
You already have.

01:50:25.115 --> 01:50:26.555
Mobile One, ground control.

01:50:26.588 --> 01:50:28.252
Yes, Doug. This is Mel.

01:50:28.316 --> 01:50:31.292
Cleveland just handed off
flight two to Chicago Center.

01:50:31.356 --> 01:50:34.012
The aircraft transmissions
aren't exactly regulation.

01:50:34.076 --> 01:50:35.547
The captain's blowing a fuse.

01:50:35.645 --> 01:50:38.331
I'd like to monitor.
What's the frequency?

01:50:38.396 --> 01:50:40.124
117.1.

01:50:44.955 --> 01:50:46.492
We need answers,
not questions.

01:50:46.557 --> 01:50:48.252
Are you guys
sleeping down there?

01:50:48.316 --> 01:50:49.693
Why aren't we getting
any action?

01:50:49.756 --> 01:50:51.292
We need help!

01:50:51.356 --> 01:50:54.333
Global two, this is the Chicago
Center watch supervisor.

01:50:54.396 --> 01:50:56.509
Please understand
we're doing everything we can.

01:50:56.604 --> 01:50:59.068
We're holding other traffic
and giving you priority.

01:50:59.164 --> 01:51:00.572
What type of approach
do you wish?

01:51:00.636 --> 01:51:02.972
Chicago supervisor,
listen carefully.

01:51:03.036 --> 01:51:06.172
Any approach is no damned good
if it ends on runway 22.

01:51:06.236 --> 01:51:07.612
We need two-niner.

01:51:07.677 --> 01:51:10.333
We've got an unserviceable
stabilizer trim,

01:51:10.396 --> 01:51:13.212
doubtful rudder control,
and structural damage.

01:51:13.276 --> 01:51:14.812
If we're brought in on 22,

01:51:14.877 --> 01:51:17.692
there'll be a broken airplane
and a lot of dead people,

01:51:17.757 --> 01:51:19.932
so you call Lincoln
and turn the screws.

01:51:19.996 --> 01:51:22.973
You tell the Lincoln manager
to get off his butt...

01:51:23.037 --> 01:51:24.445
and clear that runway!

01:51:30.077 --> 01:51:32.573
Snow desk, Mobile One.

01:51:32.636 --> 01:51:34.653
This is snow desk.
Go ahead, Mel.

01:51:34.717 --> 01:51:38.332
Danny, listen carefully.
Break the conga line.

01:51:38.397 --> 01:51:41.213
Send the heavy plows
across to runway two-niner.

01:51:41.277 --> 01:51:43.580
They're to head for stuck
airplane and await instruction.

01:51:43.645 --> 01:51:45.021
Roger.

01:51:47.516 --> 01:51:49.181
Conga leader, snow desk.

01:52:12.381 --> 01:52:13.437
Yeah, that's it.

01:52:13.533 --> 01:52:16.093
On this side,
get close under the wheel.

01:52:16.156 --> 01:52:18.045
Whack it on the other side.

01:52:35.838 --> 01:52:38.333
Keep monitoring Chicago Central
and ground control.

01:52:38.397 --> 01:52:40.253
If you hear anything
important, honk.

01:52:40.317 --> 01:52:41.406
Right.

01:52:46.621 --> 01:52:48.093
What's with the plows?

01:52:48.158 --> 01:52:50.045
If you can't move this plane,
they will.

01:52:50.141 --> 01:52:51.933
Shove an undamaged airplane
with snowplows?

01:52:51.997 --> 01:52:53.597
Are you out of your mind?

01:52:53.693 --> 01:52:55.102
No. I'm out of runways.

01:52:55.165 --> 01:52:57.374
Think of what this baby costs.

01:52:57.437 --> 01:52:59.294
I'm thinking of
that planeload of people.

01:52:59.357 --> 01:53:01.214
This runway is their only hope.

01:53:01.278 --> 01:53:03.101
If those snowplows
rip it apart,

01:53:03.165 --> 01:53:05.021
chunks of fuselage
will be everywhere.

01:53:05.054 --> 01:53:07.262
It's a chance
I've got to take.

01:53:08.797 --> 01:53:11.933
OK, but you keep those toys
out of my hair...

01:53:11.997 --> 01:53:14.494
and away from this airplane
for 15 minutes.

01:53:14.557 --> 01:53:16.574
Maybe less.
I'll drive it out.

01:53:16.637 --> 01:53:18.494
Joe, let's get one thing
straight.

01:53:18.558 --> 01:53:20.606
When tower says
time is running out,

01:53:20.702 --> 01:53:23.774
that's it, no arguments.
Plows will move on my order.

01:53:28.798 --> 01:53:31.934
Get everybody and everything out
of the way. We're starting.

01:53:31.998 --> 01:53:33.854
Get me somebody
that's cockpit-qualified.

01:53:33.917 --> 01:53:36.318
All right, everybody,
we're clearing out!

01:53:36.382 --> 01:53:39.454
And Chicago Center expects
to hand over in 12 minutes.

01:53:39.517 --> 01:53:43.326
After that, our approach control
has the flight for 8-10 minutes.

01:53:43.421 --> 01:53:45.054
We figure touchdown at 1:28.

01:53:45.119 --> 01:53:46.974
That's less time
than we figured.

01:53:47.038 --> 01:53:49.214
Also, the runway choice
must be made...

01:53:49.278 --> 01:53:51.454
no later than five minutes
before landing.

01:53:51.518 --> 01:53:54.014
After that, they're committed.
They can't turn them.

01:53:54.077 --> 01:53:57.342
-What'll we do now?
-Get out of the way and wait.

01:54:07.326 --> 01:54:10.014
And holding 6,000
on heading 205.

01:54:10.079 --> 01:54:12.255
What's the status
on runway two-niner?

01:54:12.318 --> 01:54:14.174
No change.
We'll keep you advised.

01:54:14.238 --> 01:54:15.678
Roger.

01:54:18.303 --> 01:54:20.287
Mobile One, snow desk.

01:54:21.758 --> 01:54:23.134
Go ahead, Danny.

01:54:23.198 --> 01:54:26.334
The equipment is in position,
standing by, ready to move.

01:54:30.847 --> 01:54:33.694
Roger. But be clear-
if the plows go in,

01:54:33.758 --> 01:54:35.839
I'll give the order-
no one else.

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:37.439
Right. Better you than me.

01:54:37.534 --> 01:54:39.934
You'll do a hatchet job
on that plane.

01:54:39.998 --> 01:54:42.526
Then the owners
will do the same to you.

01:54:42.623 --> 01:54:46.174
If the owners were on the plane,
they'd agree with me.

01:54:46.239 --> 01:54:49.759
-Roger. Standing by.
-Mobile One, ground control.

01:54:49.854 --> 01:54:53.343
The Center estimates hand-off to
Lincoln approach control at 17.

01:54:53.406 --> 01:54:56.222
This gives you 11 minutes
to make a decision.

01:54:56.255 --> 01:54:59.615
I must be kept informed of exact
status of approaching flight.

01:54:59.679 --> 01:55:01.182
Can we hold
this frequency clear?

01:55:01.247 --> 01:55:04.543
Affirmative. We've moved regular
traffic to another frequency.

01:55:04.607 --> 01:55:08.415
Can you also put stuck 707 on
same frequency so I can monitor?

01:55:08.479 --> 01:55:11.679
-Roger.
-May I speak to Patroni?

01:55:11.742 --> 01:55:13.088
That's OK.

01:55:17.311 --> 01:55:19.583
Approach control,
who's taking the hand-off?

01:55:19.614 --> 01:55:21.247
Frank has east arrivals.

01:55:23.711 --> 01:55:25.695
Continental 73,
due to emergency,

01:55:25.791 --> 01:55:28.575
continue to hold at Joliet.
Maintain 8,000.

01:55:28.671 --> 01:55:31.775
The Center will hand off
Global two in three minutes.

01:55:31.872 --> 01:55:34.014
He's all yours.
Stick with it.

01:55:34.110 --> 01:55:35.455
We'll take everything else.

01:55:35.551 --> 01:55:38.015
You'll have the runway
as soon as we know.

01:55:38.111 --> 01:55:39.007
Right.

01:55:49.535 --> 01:55:52.511
OK, son... let's get going.

01:55:57.984 --> 01:56:00.351
Ready to start. Pressurize.

01:56:07.071 --> 01:56:08.670
Light on number three.

01:56:21.312 --> 01:56:22.975
30 miles east of the airport,

01:56:23.071 --> 01:56:26.496
contact Lincoln approach
control. 118 point niner.

01:56:26.592 --> 01:56:28.863
-Good luck.
-Roger.

01:56:30.015 --> 01:56:31.456
Lincoln approach, Global two.

01:56:32.671 --> 01:56:34.176
Global two,
Lincoln approach control.

01:56:34.272 --> 01:56:36.415
We're still hoping
for runway two-niner.

01:56:36.512 --> 01:56:38.976
We should know
in three to five minutes.

01:56:39.071 --> 01:56:41.535
Roger, Lincoln. Keep us advised.

01:56:41.631 --> 01:56:45.215
Global two,
25 miles east of outer marker,

01:56:45.312 --> 01:56:47.136
turn right, heading 260.

01:56:47.231 --> 01:56:49.888
Begin descent at your
discretion to 2,000.

01:57:49.345 --> 01:57:52.416
Hold it, Doug. Don't commit
that flight to runway 22.

01:57:52.513 --> 01:57:55.552
There'll be a change in
two-niner's status any moment.

01:57:55.617 --> 01:57:56.545
Roger.

01:57:58.272 --> 01:58:01.537
-Snow desk, Mobile One.
-Go ahead, Mel.

01:58:01.633 --> 01:58:03.072
Start the plows.

01:58:04.193 --> 01:58:05.088
Roger.

01:58:07.872 --> 01:58:10.689
Conga leader, snow desk. Move.

01:58:14.433 --> 01:58:16.897
Joe, this is Mel.
There's no more time.

01:58:16.993 --> 01:58:20.449
Stop all engines. Get out.
Repeat. Stop all engines.

01:58:23.713 --> 01:58:26.305
Mr. Patroni,
she won't take much more.

01:58:26.369 --> 01:58:28.608
Well, anyway,
she's going to get it.

01:58:37.153 --> 01:58:40.577
Joe, the plows are moving.
Shut down and hold on!

01:58:40.672 --> 01:58:43.488
Joe Patroni, do you read me?
Acknowledge.

01:58:45.473 --> 01:58:46.785
Joe, shut down!

01:58:46.849 --> 01:58:49.665
Don't you hear?
We have to shut down!

01:58:49.698 --> 01:58:51.809
Can't hear a thing.
There's too much noise.

01:58:51.906 --> 01:58:53.729
Hold on! We're going for broke.

01:59:22.113 --> 01:59:24.673
The instruction book
said that was impossible.

01:59:24.738 --> 01:59:27.457
That's one nice thing
about the 707.

01:59:27.553 --> 01:59:29.441
It can do everything but read.

01:59:36.897 --> 01:59:38.306
Light up two-niner.

01:59:45.313 --> 01:59:48.098
Instructing aircraft
remove from runway two-niner.

01:59:48.194 --> 01:59:50.818
-I'm inspecting for debris.
-Roger. Standing by.

01:59:56.226 --> 01:59:58.081
Runway two-niner clear and open.

01:59:58.146 --> 02:00:00.993
Global two, turn right,
heading 285.

02:00:01.058 --> 02:00:02.786
Runway two-niner is now open.

02:00:04.033 --> 02:00:06.818
Roger, Lincoln. You've
just freed the slaves again.

02:00:06.913 --> 02:00:08.514
Request P. A. R. approach.

02:00:08.546 --> 02:00:09.697
Global two, Roger.

02:00:09.793 --> 02:00:12.706
This will be a precision radar
approach to runway two-niner.

02:00:12.802 --> 02:00:15.586
Stand by. We'll pick you up
on another scope.

02:00:17.954 --> 02:00:19.618
-How's it handling?
-Real sluggish.

02:00:21.122 --> 02:00:22.498
What was that?

02:00:22.594 --> 02:00:25.506
A bump! Now shut up
and move over!

02:00:32.963 --> 02:00:35.074
One bounce, we might
leave the tail behind.

02:00:36.354 --> 02:00:39.522
Heads down! Keep your arms
under your pillow!

02:00:41.954 --> 02:00:43.298
Heads down!

02:00:47.266 --> 02:00:48.578
We're going to crash!

02:00:48.674 --> 02:00:50.882
We'll be killed!
I know we're all-

02:00:50.947 --> 02:00:52.323
Ohh!

02:00:56.354 --> 02:01:00.899
Maintain heading 285. Position:
8 miles from the airport.

02:01:00.994 --> 02:01:04.995
Final approach turn in one mile.
Maintain 2,000 feet.

02:01:05.059 --> 02:01:07.746
You need not acknowledge
further transmissions.

02:01:12.674 --> 02:01:15.458
Global two, turn right,
heading two-niner-five.

02:01:15.555 --> 02:01:17.859
Approaching glidepath
in one mile.

02:01:17.954 --> 02:01:20.067
You're cleared to land
runway two-niner.

02:01:20.163 --> 02:01:23.683
Wind 300 degrees.
30, gusting 35.

02:01:32.514 --> 02:01:35.523
Now intercepting glidepath.
Begin normal rate of descent.

02:01:36.675 --> 02:01:38.019
On course.

02:01:38.147 --> 02:01:41.218
If no transmissions received
for five seconds on final,

02:01:41.315 --> 02:01:44.803
abandon radar approach and make
straight-in I. L. S. approach.

02:01:49.155 --> 02:01:53.379
Now six miles from touchdown.
Course and glidepath good.

02:01:53.475 --> 02:01:57.219
Now drifting left.
Turn further right, heading 305.

02:01:57.315 --> 02:02:00.067
Slightly high on glidepath.
Adjust your descent.

02:02:05.346 --> 02:02:06.915
Keep your head down!

02:02:09.987 --> 02:02:12.099
Passing five
miles from touchdown.

02:02:12.195 --> 02:02:14.979
Going through glidepath.
Adjust your descent.

02:02:15.076 --> 02:02:17.923
Now 100 feet low.
Ease your aircraft up.

02:02:22.755 --> 02:02:26.179
Four miles from touchdown.
Turn left, heading 301,

02:02:26.275 --> 02:02:27.939
returning to glidepath.

02:02:28.035 --> 02:02:30.819
Now on glidepath.
Check wheels down and locked.

02:02:30.915 --> 02:02:32.323
Cleared to land.

02:02:36.483 --> 02:02:39.299
Three miles from touchdown.
Course good.

02:02:39.395 --> 02:02:42.179
Slightly low on glidepath.
Ease it up a little.

02:02:42.275 --> 02:02:44.644
Surface wind gusting
to 35 knots.

02:02:48.676 --> 02:02:52.676
Two miles from touchdown.
Course good. Glidepath good.

02:02:52.707 --> 02:02:55.523
Looks OK. Advise when
approach lights in sight.

02:03:00.676 --> 02:03:03.844
-We've got the lights.
-Roger. Good luck.

02:03:06.916 --> 02:03:09.059
-Checklist complete?
-Checklist complete.

02:03:09.156 --> 02:03:11.556
-I'll need help with the rudder.
-Right.

02:04:16.228 --> 02:04:17.924
-Right rudder.

02:04:44.837 --> 02:04:48.165
OK if Jordon watches
the right side for a minute?

02:04:53.956 --> 02:04:55.429
I'll be right back.

02:04:55.525 --> 02:04:57.253
Global two, welcome home.

02:04:57.317 --> 02:04:59.972
Need a tow,
or can you taxi? Over.

02:05:02.278 --> 02:05:05.605
Global two, again,
need a tow or can you taxi?

02:05:06.917 --> 02:05:08.294
We can taxi.

02:05:16.677 --> 02:05:19.493
-How is she?
-I think she'll be all right.

02:05:19.558 --> 02:05:21.765
-Can I speak to her?
-Go ahead.

02:05:26.436 --> 02:05:28.806
Gwen... it's Vern.

02:05:30.597 --> 02:05:34.437
Can you hear me?
If you can, squeeze my hand.

02:05:40.037 --> 02:05:43.525
Hold on. You'll be all right.
We're going to make it.

02:06:01.829 --> 02:06:05.797
P. A.: Please do not obstruct
the tourist jetway.

02:06:05.894 --> 02:06:07.845
Open the gate.
Get that down here!

02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:11.973
-Mel!

02:06:12.037 --> 02:06:13.893
They're down.
Everything's fine.

02:06:13.958 --> 02:06:15.814
-I was watching television-
-I know.

02:06:15.877 --> 02:06:18.918
The news picked up the mayday
and flashed it everywhere.

02:06:19.013 --> 02:06:20.294
They're all right.

02:06:20.358 --> 02:06:22.854
P. A.: All passengers
will deplane...

02:06:22.918 --> 02:06:24.838
through the first-class
jetway.

02:06:26.469 --> 02:06:29.317
Come on. Stand back, please.
Let us through here.

02:06:29.349 --> 02:06:31.814
-I'd like a statement.
-I'll have one later.

02:06:31.877 --> 02:06:33.479
You can talk
to the captain, too.

02:06:33.509 --> 02:06:35.654
Please stand back.
This is too important.

02:06:35.717 --> 02:06:38.214
-We need a wheelchair.
-A wheelchair!

02:06:38.278 --> 02:06:39.814
I'm Mrs. Demerest.
Is Captain-

02:06:39.877 --> 02:06:41.989
-He's coming off that jetway.
-Thank you.

02:06:44.998 --> 02:06:46.854
Move back.
Let these folks through.

02:06:46.919 --> 02:06:48.454
Get these people over there.

02:06:48.518 --> 02:06:50.055
Step back, please. Step back.

02:06:50.117 --> 02:06:52.614
Those of you who aren't
helping, step back.

02:06:52.678 --> 02:06:54.886
Sit down in a central area.

02:06:57.318 --> 02:07:00.615
Sit down right here.
Sit down right here, please.

02:07:00.678 --> 02:07:02.118
We'll notify your families.

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:03.557
Judy!

02:07:03.590 --> 02:07:05.446
Oh, thank God!

02:07:09.318 --> 02:07:13.606
Stay in this area,
senora... in this area.

02:07:21.254 --> 02:07:22.278
-Oh, madam.
-Oh, oh!

02:07:22.342 --> 02:07:26.566
-I'm sorry, but that's my coat.
-I'm sorry, too.

02:07:29.478 --> 02:07:32.423
Come on, let's move back.
Let's move back, please.

02:07:36.679 --> 02:07:37.735
Hey!

02:07:41.479 --> 02:07:45.254
I'm so sorry!
He didn't mean it.

02:07:47.239 --> 02:07:49.447
He-he-he didn't mean it.

02:07:51.239 --> 02:07:52.807
I'm sorry!

02:07:54.119 --> 02:07:56.519
-I'm so sor-
-Inez.

02:07:56.582 --> 02:07:57.958
I'm sorry!

02:08:00.679 --> 02:08:02.214
I'm Dr. Nash, airport physician.

02:08:02.278 --> 02:08:05.414
I'm Dr. Compagno. A stewardess
has splinters in her eye.

02:08:05.479 --> 02:08:06.759
They may have penetrated.

02:08:06.822 --> 02:08:09.895
An ambulance is waiting
to take her to the hospital.

02:08:09.959 --> 02:08:12.134
An ophthalmic surgeon's waiting.
Any other complications?

02:08:12.199 --> 02:08:15.495
She has a fractured right arm.
They'll probably use a general.

02:08:15.559 --> 02:08:17.735
Before they decide
which type of anesthesia,

02:08:17.798 --> 02:08:19.206
tell them she's pregnant.

02:08:20.647 --> 02:08:22.087
Here she comes.

02:08:29.798 --> 02:08:32.295
It's all right.
We'll take care of her.

02:08:32.359 --> 02:08:33.767
I'm going with her.

02:08:57.639 --> 02:08:59.304
Nice going, sweetheart.

02:08:59.367 --> 02:09:02.568
Remind me to send a thank-you
to Mr. Boeing.

02:09:16.199 --> 02:09:18.696
Good morning.
First class or economy?

02:09:18.759 --> 02:09:20.327
First class.

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:27.944
You know, it was much more fun
the other way.

02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:32.936
I'm too keyed up to sleep.
What about breakfast?

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.207
Good idea.
Where should we go?

02:09:36.328 --> 02:09:37.415
Your apartment.

02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:40.008
Well, you've been bragging
about your scrambled eggs.

02:09:40.103 --> 02:09:42.663
It's time I found out
how good they are.

02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.696
Mr. Bakersfeld?

02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:49.160
Maintenance just called.
The snow blowers got damaged.

02:09:49.256 --> 02:09:52.936
Mike wants you to decide whether
to work overtime to repair them.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.624
-Tell him to do it himself.
-Yes, sir.

02:09:56.305 --> 02:10:02.193
