01:04.480 --> 01:05.760
Who is it?

01:05.960 --> 01:08.995
It's Lieutenant Finley.
He's coming up the path.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.635
It might be worth
listening to him, Edna.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.600
So he can tell me about D-Day?
I don't wanna hear about D-Day.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.871
Look what happened to my son.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.835
Hold it, Peggy.
Cut from D-Day to...

01:22.880 --> 01:25.315
..."Don't tell me about
the black market."

01:25.360 --> 01:27.195
You're making me a bitch...

01:27.240 --> 01:29.155
...to keep in your propaganda!

01:29.200 --> 01:30.892
Peggy, I'll tell you--

01:31.080 --> 01:33.440
Oh, Jesus!

01:33.680 --> 01:37.875
Oh, Bill. Katie wants to keep in
the black market. Bill!

01:37.920 --> 01:39.835
Glad you're back.
How did it go?

01:39.880 --> 01:43.515
Goddamn Pentagon, all they see
is red! Where's my coffee?

01:43.560 --> 01:45.195
Get you some in a minute.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.235
Don't cast that broad again.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.742
Takes a reactionary to play one.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.035
Where's my coffee?
Can't the chintzy OWI afford a gofer?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.618
And where's Roxanne?

01:54.680 --> 01:58.035
She called and she said that
she couldn't make it.

01:58.080 --> 02:02.155
We'd like to get set up and go
from the top again, Mr. Verso.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.515
- What's the matter?
- What is this?

02:04.560 --> 02:06.635
Two lines I wrote.
No good, huh?

02:06.680 --> 02:09.834
Morosky, let me do the writing,
will you?

02:10.400 --> 02:14.246
Christ, I'm tired of being
a patriot for no money.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.995
- She can't come?
- Nope.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.035
Okay, Katie, you're in luck.

02:20.080 --> 02:25.618
I'm taking you to El Morocco, courtesy
of the Office of War Information.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.075
All right, Americans,
let's take it from the top.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.800
One, two. One, two, three.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.717
Clear the way.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.800
Please clear the way.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.955
Sir, we have a reservation.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.715
- There are no more tables.
- But we called...

03:14.760 --> 03:16.995
- ...and you said--
- Sorry, no tables.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.715
- I told you--
- But we called--

03:18.760 --> 03:22.795
I'd like to know your name
and also why you're not in uniform.

03:22.840 --> 03:27.148
These boys have been in combat,
you fascist rope-holder.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.035
- Hi, Fred. Bill Verso. OWI.
- Don't tip him.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.795
- Get his name!
- We were with a whole bunch of people.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.680
- Hey, Verso! Merry old Bill Verso.
- Hey, Tiny!

03:39.080 --> 03:40.435
Stop it!
Don't do that!

03:40.480 --> 03:41.435
They're with us.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.600
Come on!

03:45.760 --> 03:47.635
Thanks, Tiny.
Good to see you.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.200
Listen, Katie--
Hey, Jimbo!

03:51.200 --> 03:54.195
Can't you leave your
soapbox at home just once?

03:54.240 --> 03:55.394
Coming through.

03:57.720 --> 04:01.797
What do you want to drink?
I know. Dubonnet over ice.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.265
Dubonnet over ice
and a scotch, straight up.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.800
Here's your Dubonnet, Morosky.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.520
Oh, to be in uniform!

04:35.560 --> 04:37.440
Hubbell Gardiner.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.680
What?

04:39.760 --> 04:40.991
That's his name.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.800
Swell. What's hers?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.355
I suppose they learn that
balance on board ship.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.246
Absolutely. Let's dance.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.035
What've you got to lose?

04:50.080 --> 04:54.234
I'll probably go overseas soon.
It's pretty hush-hush.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.635
Save Loyalist Spain!
Stop Franco for world peace now!

05:51.680 --> 05:53.680
Write President Roosevelt!

05:54.000 --> 05:56.440
Come on. Do something about it!

05:56.640 --> 05:59.640
Save Spain!
Stop Franco!

05:59.840 --> 06:03.635
Stop the slaughter of innocent women
and children. Do something!

06:03.680 --> 06:05.515
Write your congressman today.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.515
Katie, what are you selling?

06:07.560 --> 06:08.560
The ROTC.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.560
You can have it cheap!

06:10.880 --> 06:11.880
Fascist.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.520
Row, Hubbell!

08:52.880 --> 08:54.640
A true peace rally...

08:54.840 --> 08:58.355
...should cover the entire spectrum
from extreme right...

08:58.400 --> 09:01.955
...to extreme left.
As our next speaker proves.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.195
The President of the Young Communist
League. She needs no introduction.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.760
Miss Katie Morosky.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.275
Guess I do need an introduction.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.720
Back up, Katie.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.074
Yeah, all the way to Moscow!

09:21.760 --> 09:25.991
You can still take Communion
and like the Soviet Union!

09:26.040 --> 09:28.555
What's cooking in the Kremlin, Katie?

09:28.600 --> 09:32.435
The Kremlin's worried about the
civil war in Spain. Are you?

09:32.480 --> 09:36.995
Thousands of Spanish citizens
are being bombed and murdered.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.578
Only one country is sending help.
One country.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.200
The Soviet Union.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.160
K-K-K-Katie, be my C-C-C-Comrade.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.840
O-K-K-K-Kay!

09:52.600 --> 09:54.369
What are you scared of?

09:55.600 --> 09:58.835
The Russians don't want anybody
in Spain but the Spanish.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.400
Is that scary?

10:01.680 --> 10:06.834
They're Communists, but they want
total disarmament. Is that scary?

10:07.480 --> 10:12.035
Hitler and Mussolini are using Spain
as testing ground for what they want.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.640
Another world war! Is that scary?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.726
You're darn right it is!

10:17.080 --> 10:19.835
There's only one thing
to be scared of...

10:19.880 --> 10:24.195
...and it's not me, it's not the
Young Communist League...

10:24.240 --> 10:26.702
..and it's not the Red bogeyman.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.400
You be scared of anybody, anyplace...

10:31.600 --> 10:35.920
...who will not stand up
for world peace now!

10:47.440 --> 10:48.671
You're really...

10:49.280 --> 10:50.835
...you're really something.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.200
Really--
You're really beautiful.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.640
No, I mean it.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.800
You're really beautiful.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.200
You're the best...

11:03.840 --> 11:05.400
...the brightest...

11:06.000 --> 11:09.315
...most committed generation
this country's ever had.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.195
That's why you're here today,
striking for peace.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.435
Why, they're striking on almost every
single campus in this country.

11:16.480 --> 11:21.235
They're taking that pledge. Show your
solidarity by taking it with them.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.560
"I refuse to support"--

11:23.760 --> 11:25.440
Come on, come on.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.875
"I refuse"-- Come on.
On your feet!

11:27.920 --> 11:31.635
"I refuse to"-- That's right.
On your feet. Everybody.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.760
"I refuse to support"--

11:34.040 --> 11:36.120
No, everybody. Everybody!

11:36.320 --> 11:38.880
"I refuse to support...

11:39.280 --> 11:42.195
...the government of
the United States...

11:42.240 --> 11:45.280
...in any war it might conduct."

12:02.760 --> 12:06.835
The student council calls
this a peace rally. I call it...

12:06.880 --> 12:08.235
...a peace strike.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.600
And I'm an English major.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.338
It isn't that funny.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.680
You fascists!

12:49.080 --> 12:53.080
- We have to talk about this stuff.
- Wait a second.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.755
- You've been on that for two months.
- Three.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.115
It's a short story--

12:58.160 --> 13:00.755
Frankie Mc Veigh,
you're not funny.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.555
- I know it.
- Listen...

13:02.600 --> 13:06.235
...would you do me a favour?
Take the YCL meeting Monday night.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.635
- You can't miss a meeting.
- I have to.

13:08.680 --> 13:12.988
The story is due on Tuesday
and it's just gotta be good.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.280
Look who's here,
America the beautiful.

13:20.840 --> 13:25.200
- How much do you have in the treasury?
- $542.18.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.595
Possible themes for the prom.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.560
"Caribbean Holiday," "Jungle Fever"--

13:32.760 --> 13:35.195
Hey, you should be listening to this.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.471
"Niagara Falls."

13:37.680 --> 13:40.800
"Thirteen Colonies," "48 States."

13:41.680 --> 13:43.955
"Thirteen Colonies," "48 States"--

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
J.J.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.400
J.J., listen.

13:47.600 --> 13:52.435
"The 48 States," "Starlight, Star
Bright" and " In My Merry Oldsmobile."

13:52.480 --> 13:55.172
How about
"Bread Lines Can Be Fun"?

13:57.920 --> 14:00.600
How about "The Stalin Shuffle"?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.932
What are we gonna have?
Hamburgers?

14:06.320 --> 14:10.089
How about "The College Grad
Meets The Leningrad"?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.249
She's a million laughs.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.917
- What do you want?
- Coke.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.603
- Coca-Cola?
- Coca-Cola.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.640
Excuse me.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.532
You're all decadent
and disgusting.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.915
Come on, we weren't
making fun of you.

14:31.960 --> 14:36.345
You make fun of everything.
You think politics is a joke.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.435
You make fun of politicians.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.195
- What else can you do?
- Think Franco's funny?

14:42.240 --> 14:45.595
- Franco? Is he here?
- Yeah, Franco. He's a politician.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.794
He's funny? Hitler has a funny
moustache. Why not have a Nazi prom?

14:51.840 --> 14:55.532
Well, we thought of that,
but the uniforms itch.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.235
Comes the revolution, maybe
we'll have a sense of humour.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.195
Four cheeseburgers, four cokes.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.640
Onion?

15:10.880 --> 15:12.400
Yeah, in the cokes.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.235
If I read comparatively few of your
stories aloud in class...

16:21.280 --> 16:25.435
...it's because I think we
learn best from what's good.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.400
Or at least, talented.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.475
Today I'm going to read,
with a great deal of pleasure...

16:31.520 --> 16:36.200
...a remarkably good story
from a surprising new source.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.126
The name of the story is
"The All-American Smile."

16:42.280 --> 16:44.511
And it's by Hubbell Gardiner.

16:51.840 --> 16:55.455
"In a way, he was like the country
he lived in.

16:55.640 --> 17:00.178
Everything came too easily to him,
but at least he knew it.

17:01.280 --> 17:05.126
About once a month he worried
that he was a fraud.

17:05.400 --> 17:09.234
But then most everyone he knew
was more fraudulent.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.895
Sometimes he felt....

17:48.880 --> 17:52.265
--there's really no reason
for us to change.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.115
But of course by then, they were
too lost or too lazy.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.000
It had always been too easy."

18:52.480 --> 18:56.403
The trouble with some people
is they work too hard.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.409
Are you speaking to me?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Want a beer?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.117
I don't drink.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.360
One sip. One sip of beer.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.235
Well?

19:18.280 --> 19:22.675
- You carry your books all the time?
- That's what I crossed the street for?

19:22.720 --> 19:23.951
I'm celebrating.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.555
What are you celebrating?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.908
I got you to cross the street.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.809
Listen, I'm sorry I....

19:39.280 --> 19:42.835
I haven't told you that
I really liked your story.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.640
You're a good writer.

19:44.840 --> 19:45.840
Thank you.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.235
Mrs. Simpson married the Duke of
Windsor. It's in tomorrow's paper.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.635
How do you know that?
The papers aren't out yet.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.218
I work in the Linotype room
two nights a week.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.209
You never quit, do you?

20:09.080 --> 20:10.080
Well...

20:11.280 --> 20:14.588
...thanks for getting me
across the street.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.200
I sold one.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.794
I sold a story.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.603
I've never known anybody who sold one.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.188
Oh, boy, Hubbell.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.652
Okay, so have a drink.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.240
Sit.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.035
To your first novel.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.400
- Wait a minute, not so fast.
- Why not?

21:09.080 --> 21:11.000
Yeah, why not?

21:15.320 --> 21:17.012
You should've laughed.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.955
"Any peace but Katie's piece."

21:20.000 --> 21:21.955
You were good. You had them.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.355
You could've kept them,
if only you'd laughed.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.715
- It wasn't funny.
- That's not the only reason to laugh.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.395
- You're a puritan.
- I am not.

21:30.440 --> 21:33.595
- You've no sense of humour.
- My family thinks I'm humorous.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.715
- Why are you always angry?
- Not always! Because I don't know...

21:37.760 --> 21:41.835
...about coed humour. I've never
been in a fraternity or sorority...

21:41.880 --> 21:45.715
...which is where I'm sure they make up
all that dirty stuff anyway.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.515
That's pretty dirty business.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.715
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.800
Do you smile all the time?

21:54.240 --> 21:55.240
No.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.160
No. No.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.849
Here's to commencement.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.600
A funny word for "the end."

22:24.880 --> 22:28.034
Mrs. Simpson married
the Duke of Windsor.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.515
I told you that, didn't I?

22:31.560 --> 22:32.800
Yeah, you did.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.458
I'm really happy about your news.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.155
I hope I get to read
your story someday.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.662
Put your foot here.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.665
Go get 'em, Katie.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.788
See you, Hubbell.

23:18.840 --> 23:19.840
See you.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.511
Don't spill it on your dress.

23:49.280 --> 23:53.955
I'd like to have the sewing concession
when they want to shorten those dresses.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
You know, to get
some wear out of them.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.920
Grab your coat and get your hat

24:37.120 --> 24:40.600
Leave your worries on the doorstep

24:41.240 --> 24:43.995
I'm glad we're not
working on commission.

24:44.040 --> 24:49.655
I've never been to a dance before,
except the one the YCL gave for Spain.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.800
Here, have a drink.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.835
- Here.
- What's that, bourbon?

24:59.880 --> 25:01.803
It's gin, Katie. Come on.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.200
From the bottle? So bourgeois.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.395
- Let's dance.
- We aren't supposed to.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.825
You weren't supposed to buy me a
corsage either. Come on.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.400
Can you, Frankie?

25:31.280 --> 25:34.972
Frankie Mc Veigh, you've got
a foot for dancing!

27:47.400 --> 27:48.400
Hubbell?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Hubbell?

28:12.040 --> 28:13.400
What do you know?

28:17.160 --> 28:18.852
Small world, isn't it?

28:20.400 --> 28:21.560
I fall asleep?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
I think so.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.635
What do you know?

28:27.680 --> 28:30.680
Would you like to have
a cup of coffee?

28:32.880 --> 28:34.600
Oh, yeah.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.000
Coffee.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.942
Here you are, kiddo.
Good night.

28:54.720 --> 28:55.720
Good night.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.800
Good night, Hubbell, old boy.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.360
Whoever you are.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.000
Who are you?

29:13.240 --> 29:15.000
It's the top floor.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.880
Only one more!

29:35.480 --> 29:36.800
In there.

31:17.720 --> 31:18.720
Hubbell?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.040
Hubbell?

31:25.840 --> 31:28.071
General quarters!
Count down!

31:28.160 --> 31:29.280
Stand safe....

35:39.440 --> 35:40.440
Hubbell.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.160
Hubbell, it's Katie.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.360
You didn't know it was Katie.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.755
I'll be done in a minute.

36:04.800 --> 36:09.075
- You don't have to do that.
- Oh, it's okay. I like to iron.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.435
Gee, you have a lot
of ribbons here.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.095
You have any aspirin?

36:14.520 --> 36:15.800
Oh, I don't.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.646
Push in on your temples.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.955
How can you not have aspirin?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.154
I always eat for a headache.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.395
Do you have my watch?
Do you know where it is?

36:39.440 --> 36:42.517
I took it off and put it
on the bedpost.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.726
I thought you'd be more comfortable--

36:59.440 --> 37:00.915
- That's why I....
- Here.

37:00.960 --> 37:01.960
Thank you.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.560
It's your hair.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.846
That's what's different.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.668
I have it ironed.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.040
You have your hair ironed?

37:22.720 --> 37:23.720
Does it hurt?

37:25.240 --> 37:26.240
No.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.835
Have some coffee at least.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.880
I'm low on sugar,
but it's real coffee.

37:39.440 --> 37:42.675
No, thank you. I have to
meet J.J. at the train.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.182
Looks good, though.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.298
You still have J.J.?

37:48.280 --> 37:51.675
How long will you be around?
Where are you stationed?

37:51.720 --> 37:52.800
In Washington.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.075
Oh, that's good.
That could be exciting.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.120
Why?

37:57.320 --> 37:58.675
Roosevelt is there.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.395
I thought the Party said he was
an evil warmonger.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.160
How do you know that?

38:04.360 --> 38:08.745
You still think a varsity letter
stands for "moron," huh?

38:10.840 --> 38:14.071
Some people work out
better than we think.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.875
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, listen....

38:18.920 --> 38:22.675
This is my number, and this is
the OWI office where I work.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.955
This is the radio station. It's
very difficult to find a hotel room.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.692
If you're ever in town and you
can't find one, well, just....

38:32.520 --> 38:34.440
No obligation of course.

38:34.760 --> 38:35.760
Thank you.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.338
About last night....

38:39.760 --> 38:43.760
I'm sorry. I've been
falling asleep all over lately.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.240
That's okay.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.123
Hope my snoring didn't
keep you awake.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.675
Oh, that's okay.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.360
I like snoring.

38:57.720 --> 38:58.874
See you, Katie.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.160
See you, Hubbell.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.160
Good luck.

39:05.240 --> 39:08.315
American-Soviet benefit,
Friday night at town hall!

39:08.360 --> 39:11.515
Come to the American-Soviet
Friendship benefit Friday.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.755
American-Soviet benefit
at town hall, folks.

39:14.800 --> 39:18.115
Come to the American-Soviet
benefit Friday night.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.155
Thank you. Big show.
Big show at town hall, folks.

39:21.200 --> 39:24.595
Come to the American-Soviet
benefit Friday night.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.115
Hey, soldier, why don't you
bring a date?

39:27.160 --> 39:29.795
Come to the American-Soviet benefit.

39:29.840 --> 39:30.840
Bring a date.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.555
Come to the American-Soviet benefit.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.955
American-Soviet--
Jesus, I'm late for the OWI.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.515
See you later, Pony.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.560
Bye!

39:40.400 --> 39:43.355
- Vote for Thomas E. Dewey!
- We've gotta stop FDR.

39:43.400 --> 39:48.169
I'll take them. I'll give them
to your friends. I'll help you.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.200
CDHQ, America Calling.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.475
Applications are available
at your local post office.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.212
CDHQ, America Calling.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.160
Can you identify them?

39:59.640 --> 40:04.200
Over the Bronx?
25 Stuka Dive Bombers.

40:04.440 --> 40:08.995
I've got it, madam. Yes, I remember
Pearl Harbor. I'll connect you.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.475
Even if he lost the paper,
I'm still in the book.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.400
It's only been a week.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.486
One moment, please.
I'll connect you.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.155
He could phone at least.
CDHQ, America Calling.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.354
Phone where?
You've only got eleven jobs.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.355
You've censored all
but nine minutes.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.595
- It implied that we spit on Negroes.
- Which you do.

40:29.640 --> 40:33.195
- The situation--
- Now the Negroes are a situation?

40:33.240 --> 40:34.995
After the war, the Pentagon--

40:35.040 --> 40:37.955
It'll be just like it was
before, you racist fink!

40:38.000 --> 40:40.115
- What's with her this week?
- This week?

40:40.160 --> 40:42.155
- What do you mean?
- Shut up!

40:42.200 --> 40:45.195
- I have 21 minutes of dead airspace!
- It's his fault!

40:45.240 --> 40:47.720
Okay, okay! I'll sign.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.720
Hubbell?

40:49.920 --> 40:52.155
- Where are you?
- Grant's tomb.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.795
I can't get a room.
Can I use your couch?

40:54.840 --> 40:57.475
- Of course you can.
- Morosky, we have--

40:57.520 --> 40:59.000
Will you, please!

40:59.240 --> 41:02.755
Hubbell, there's beer in the icebox
and clean towels...

41:02.800 --> 41:04.755
...and if you wanna take a nap...

41:04.800 --> 41:08.595
...take off the phone and put it
in the drawer of the desk.

41:08.640 --> 41:12.178
- How do I get the key?
- I'll call the super.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.200
Hubbell!

41:47.800 --> 41:51.338
I wasn't sure when you'd be home.
How are you?

41:51.800 --> 41:54.555
I'll be back later.
Could you leave a key--?

41:54.600 --> 41:58.675
You can't. I got steaks and potatoes
and sour cream and chives...

41:58.720 --> 42:00.595
...and salad and fresh pie.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.595
I would have made pot roast...

42:02.640 --> 42:06.995
...but I didn't know if you liked it.
Anyway, there wasn't time...

42:07.040 --> 42:09.395
...so I got steaks with
my ration stamps.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.355
And you must be hungry,
you couldn't have had time to eat.

42:13.400 --> 42:19.169
You can't go yet. You've got to stay
for supper, that's all there is to it.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.388
What kind of pie?

42:27.320 --> 42:28.782
Oh, your hero, huh?

42:28.880 --> 42:29.880
Who?

42:36.600 --> 42:39.395
He wasn't in college when he
did nothing for Spain.

42:39.440 --> 42:43.555
- Congress was isolationist in '37--
- You'd justify the Nazi-Soviet pact.

42:43.600 --> 42:47.315
Easier than you can justify the
Allies sitting on their behinds--

42:47.360 --> 42:49.360
Why can't you say asses?

42:52.000 --> 42:53.923
- Because I can't.
- Why?

42:54.000 --> 42:55.360
What happens?

42:55.560 --> 42:57.400
I don't know. Nothing.

42:57.640 --> 43:00.315
- What a subject for two--
- It's interesting.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.437
You'd rather talk politics.

43:02.640 --> 43:07.315
All the contradictions. Should we
get in the war, should we not?

43:07.360 --> 43:09.835
Stalin's for Hitler.
Stalin's against him.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.635
All political doubletalk,
but you hold on.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.155
I don't know how you do it.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.277
I don't know how you can't.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.114
You're jealous.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.560
- What?
- You are.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.978
Why are you jealous?

43:25.640 --> 43:27.160
I'll live.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.360
Maybe longer.

43:30.720 --> 43:33.335
But you won't write another novel.

43:52.760 --> 43:56.075
You must've gotten one
of the two copies sold.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.795
- You get through it?
- Oh, I managed.

43:58.840 --> 43:59.960
Twice.

44:00.960 --> 44:01.960
I liked it.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.360
I liked it a lot.

44:07.320 --> 44:08.935
What didn't you like?

44:10.720 --> 44:13.200
The way you write is no problem.

44:13.400 --> 44:16.477
Your style is absolutely gorgeous.
But--

44:16.600 --> 44:17.600
Gorgeous?

44:18.240 --> 44:19.320
It is.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.360
It is gorgeous.

44:25.560 --> 44:26.960
But you...

44:28.240 --> 44:29.317
...stand back.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.286
Do you know what I mean?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.160
Go ahead.

44:38.120 --> 44:40.560
You see, the people...

44:41.720 --> 44:44.360
...you watch them...

44:45.160 --> 44:46.760
...from a distance.

44:47.520 --> 44:48.520
Where?

44:49.240 --> 44:50.240
In the book.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.115
I know, in the book.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.600
Where in the book?

44:53.800 --> 44:55.160
Be specific.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.560
All through it, Hubbell.

45:03.240 --> 45:07.075
But it's your first novel, and
I'm sure the second one will be--

45:07.120 --> 45:09.195
Why should I write another novel?

45:09.240 --> 45:13.086
Because you must!
You're too good a writer not to.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.795
Are you really so sure
of everything you're so sure of?

45:22.840 --> 45:23.840
Sure.

45:24.920 --> 45:25.875
Aren't you?

45:25.920 --> 45:27.080
No.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.800
No. Not as sure.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.102
Do things still come too easily?

45:38.040 --> 45:40.875
"In a way he was like
the country he lived in.

45:40.920 --> 45:43.612
Everything came too easily to him."

45:44.840 --> 45:46.994
What made you remember that?

45:49.320 --> 45:52.397
I always wondered if
it would stay true.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.314
Not altogether.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.597
What doesn't come easy now?

46:04.240 --> 46:05.760
Hotel rooms.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.960
Be serious.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.960
Do you know you're beautiful?

46:31.960 --> 46:33.360
You are.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.760
But you mustn't be too serious.

46:42.240 --> 46:43.440
I won't be.

46:44.040 --> 46:45.560
I won't be.

48:16.840 --> 48:18.640
Happy Rosh Hashanah!

48:23.720 --> 48:27.182
- What is it?
- What do you mean, what is it?

48:31.880 --> 48:33.995
You get to see your old pal J.J.

48:34.040 --> 48:37.995
It'll be fun. We can all be
decadent and eat eggs Benedict...

48:38.040 --> 48:39.715
...and vote Republican.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.760
- I don't like eggs Benedict.
- Really?

48:43.720 --> 48:46.797
- I'll bet you were a cheerleader.
- Me?

48:47.200 --> 48:48.431
- Come on.
- No!

48:48.640 --> 48:51.000
Maybe you'll have a good time.

48:51.200 --> 48:55.000
Paper doll that I can call my own

48:55.240 --> 48:57.395
A doll that other fellows....

48:57.440 --> 49:00.355
Boy, this is some Navy
you're in, J.J.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.480
Hi, Hub.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.795
You mean all this?
It belongs to my aunt.

49:05.840 --> 49:08.195
Is that the one that
plays the accordion?

49:08.240 --> 49:10.315
Does she really play the accordion?

49:10.360 --> 49:12.635
- She got squeezed to death.
- She did not.

49:12.680 --> 49:15.757
She's gone overseas.
She's with the USO.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.400
Best USO?

49:17.600 --> 49:19.400
- Come on.
- I got it.

49:19.600 --> 49:20.875
Hollywood and Vine.

49:20.920 --> 49:22.240
Best USO hostess?

49:22.440 --> 49:23.825
Tallulah Bankhead.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.795
I hope your aunt's under Patton.

49:25.840 --> 49:28.378
You can bet she's under somebody.

49:29.640 --> 49:30.640
Excuse me.

49:30.720 --> 49:31.760
All right.

49:32.560 --> 49:36.098
- Okay. How about-- Gardiner?
- Wait a second.

49:36.240 --> 49:39.595
- Best small hotel.
- Not fair. I haven't been abroad.

49:39.640 --> 49:41.275
But it's in Switzerland.

49:41.320 --> 49:45.235
We don't want to make any bad jokes.
Saint Regis in Paris.

49:45.280 --> 49:46.760
Pretty, isn't it?

49:49.120 --> 49:50.275
You look different.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.705
It's my hair.
I have it ironed.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.480
- You what?
- In Harlem.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.595
I actually have friends
in Harlem.

49:58.640 --> 50:01.995
I'm sure you do.
Would you like me to disapprove?

50:02.040 --> 50:04.475
But how long has this been going on?

50:04.520 --> 50:07.595
I mean, Hubbell Gardiner and
K-K-K-Katie Morosky.

50:07.640 --> 50:11.155
- No. No, she looks terrific.
- I like her, J.J.

50:11.200 --> 50:15.738
- You really haven't changed, have you?
- Neither have you.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.305
As pretty as ever.

50:18.360 --> 50:19.760
For a while.

50:21.360 --> 50:22.745
I'm with J.J. now.

50:23.960 --> 50:24.960
Are you?

50:25.800 --> 50:27.160
Excuse me.

50:28.760 --> 50:31.995
Remember how she looked
in college compared to now?

50:32.040 --> 50:34.795
- Can I get you a drink?
- I don't think so.

50:34.840 --> 50:38.071
- What were you doing?
- She seemed upset.

50:42.120 --> 50:45.735
You do it. You make yourself
feel out of place.

50:47.080 --> 50:50.995
I feel like I'm here for drinks
and everyone else gets supper.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.720
Try talking to them.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.595
- I have.
- No you don't.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.395
You don't talk, you lecture.

50:56.440 --> 50:58.715
What was that speech about Yalta?

50:58.760 --> 51:01.195
No one here needs you to explain it.

51:01.240 --> 51:03.355
Then why all those silly jokes?

51:03.400 --> 51:06.515
J.J. called Roosevelt
the "Yaltese Falcon."

51:06.560 --> 51:08.795
I thought it was pretty funny.

51:08.840 --> 51:12.675
And selling your novel to Hollywood?
I hope that's meant to be funny.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.160
- Why?
- Why?

51:14.360 --> 51:17.155
Because you're too good
for Hollywood, that's why.

51:17.200 --> 51:20.155
Maybe I'd be lucky to sell a
book to Hollywood.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.355
You've never even been there!

51:22.400 --> 51:26.795
Besides, this isn't the point.
Can't we just relax and enjoy the party?

51:26.840 --> 51:32.475
You get onto politics, and your sense
of humour goes right out the window.

51:32.520 --> 51:35.715
I guess there are just
some things that are...

51:35.760 --> 51:39.075
...difficult for me
to laugh about, Hubbell.

51:39.120 --> 51:43.120
Than have a fickle-minded
Real live girl

51:57.440 --> 51:58.560
I'm sorry.

51:59.400 --> 52:01.995
I got caught up at the studio and...

52:02.040 --> 52:05.515
...then I met somebody from
the party who wondered--

52:05.560 --> 52:06.800
What? What?

52:07.000 --> 52:08.960
The first eight chapters.

52:12.160 --> 52:15.475
You want to read it, read it.
But let's not discuss it.

52:15.520 --> 52:16.560
All right.

52:18.640 --> 52:22.675
If you don't like it, you have to say
you don't like it and why.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.160
What if I like it?

52:25.240 --> 52:26.240
Waiter?

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
Ahoy.

52:50.200 --> 52:51.200
Come in.

53:02.520 --> 53:03.595
How you doing?

53:03.640 --> 53:04.640
Fine.

53:12.680 --> 53:13.680
Is that new?

53:13.800 --> 53:15.723
It was in the other room.

53:18.120 --> 53:19.560
Looks good there.

53:21.920 --> 53:23.689
Plants are all growing.

53:28.920 --> 53:30.305
How's your mother?

53:31.240 --> 53:33.400
Much better, like the news.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.795
I might be able sell
my book to Hollywood.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.760
I know, J.J. told me.

53:48.040 --> 53:50.560
What do you think about that?

53:51.800 --> 53:54.954
About living in sunshine
all year long...

53:55.960 --> 53:58.806
...and going to work in a sports car?

53:59.760 --> 54:00.760
Sailing.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.960
Sounds wonderful.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.209
Would you like a drink?

54:23.960 --> 54:24.960
No.

54:26.640 --> 54:30.560
No, I just stopped.
I was out walking.

54:34.560 --> 54:35.760
Hey, thanks.

55:11.320 --> 55:13.440
I love the way you write.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.720
Franklin Roosevelt is dead.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.315
Most of you have already
heard the news.

55:25.360 --> 55:28.955
But it will take days,
perhaps weeks, even months...

55:29.000 --> 55:33.355
...for the final tragedy of
what happened at 5:45 this morning...

55:33.400 --> 55:35.554
...to be fully comprehended.

55:35.760 --> 55:39.675
What seems particularly touching
is that he will not be here...

55:39.720 --> 55:42.951
...to share in a victory
so close at hand.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.320
Did you go see it?

55:45.800 --> 55:47.520
I was talking to....

55:48.280 --> 55:50.235
There was this older guy...

55:50.280 --> 55:54.126
...on, you know, that
steel platform between cars?

55:55.000 --> 55:59.760
I helped him open
a big door, he needed air.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.154
Jesus, I can't even remember
when he wasn't President.

56:05.400 --> 56:08.475
A fourth term was too much
for the old man.

56:08.520 --> 56:10.435
A third was too much
for my old man.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.955
- At least it'll end those Eleanor jokes.
- Some were funny.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.875
How about Eleanor in the mine
with the hillbillies?

56:17.920 --> 56:20.235
Her face was covered
with grime, right?

56:20.280 --> 56:23.715
Grime? For chrissakes, Judianne,
Eleanor went down into...

56:23.760 --> 56:27.795
...a mine and got her face black with
coal. The hillbillies saw her...

56:27.840 --> 56:29.435
...big buckteeth shining--

56:29.480 --> 56:31.080
Her husband is dead!

56:32.720 --> 56:33.800
Dead.

56:35.160 --> 56:38.622
Yes, Mrs. Roosevelt went down
into the mines.

56:38.800 --> 56:42.915
And when they asked her why,
she said, "I am my husband's legs."

56:42.960 --> 56:48.191
Did you tell cripple jokes too?
Is there anything that isn't a joke?

56:53.320 --> 56:54.440
Sorry.

56:56.920 --> 56:58.755
Who makes up jokes anyway?

56:58.800 --> 57:00.000
J.J.'s old man.

57:01.960 --> 57:04.755
Scads of swell material here
for a good novel.

57:04.800 --> 57:06.555
If you wanna write about this.

57:06.600 --> 57:09.675
People who tell jokes
instead of feeling something.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.555
Let's meet every five years...

57:11.600 --> 57:14.555
...or every time a President conks.
Whichever's sooner!

57:14.600 --> 57:17.235
- What are you doing?
- What are we doing here?

57:17.280 --> 57:21.635
J.J.'s gonna buy your book and
we're all gonna go to Hollywood?

57:21.680 --> 57:22.635
Take it easy.

57:22.680 --> 57:24.915
Lots of writers went there.
Fitzgerald--

57:24.960 --> 57:26.875
- He's dead!
- I know that.

57:26.920 --> 57:29.915
It's none of your business anyway.
He died of booze...

57:29.960 --> 57:33.422
- ...and people like you!
- Damn it, stop it!

57:35.400 --> 57:36.915
He's sorry for the joke.

57:36.960 --> 57:41.235
Why did you bring me here?
Couldn't we have gone for a walk...

57:41.280 --> 57:44.555
- ...or sit on a bench?
- I didn't want to feel sadder.

57:44.600 --> 57:49.075
- What's wrong with feeling sadder?
- It won't help! The President died!

57:49.120 --> 57:54.351
And everything in the world that
happens doesn't just happen to you.

57:56.360 --> 57:57.315
Behave yourself.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.052
I don't care about behaving myself!

58:00.240 --> 58:02.720
Then don't. Do what you want.

58:03.800 --> 58:05.720
I wanna get out of here.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.520
All right.

58:13.600 --> 58:15.160
I meant us.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.720
And then what?

58:44.080 --> 58:45.720
See you later, Katie.

58:46.480 --> 58:48.120
Oh, yeah, see you.

58:51.120 --> 58:55.197
Good night, my beauty.
You can finish in the morning.

59:05.680 --> 59:06.680
Cheer up.

59:06.880 --> 59:11.957
I'm about to have a big night and
I wanna think of you as smiling.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.745
Good night, Billy.

59:33.360 --> 59:34.360
Hi.

59:34.960 --> 59:35.960
Hi.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.846
Gee, I thought you
got sent overseas.

59:40.200 --> 59:41.738
Could I talk to you?

59:43.320 --> 59:44.320
Sure.

59:53.320 --> 59:57.035
Listen, I was a bad girl.
I know that. But I'm better now.

59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.755
It was like a tantrum.
I get them from time to time.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.315
It's like an eclipse.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.435
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.557
I wanted to have an apology dinner.
I thought I'd fill my icebox--

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.422
I'm a pain in the ass, aren't I?

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.315
I go to swearing school now.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.515
Soundproof school.
I'm up to the F's.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.835
I'm taking a laughing course
and studying Protestant cookery.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880
Don't.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.520
Are you finished?

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.555
Look, Katie--

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.677
Please don't start with "Look."
It's always bad news.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.514
I don't think we're gonna
make it, Katie.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.240
Why?

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.295
I just don't think it's
gonna work, that's all.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.969
I was too easy for you.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.320
Easy?

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.120
I don't mean sexually.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.035
I mean easy like
everything is for you.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.311
You really think you're easy?

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.115
Compared to what?
The Hundred Years' War?

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.115
You're so ready to fight,
you have no time to understand.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.035
Counterattack, politics,
revolution, cause!

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.835
That's all fine for you.
So stay with it. I admire it.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.915
- Up to a point.
- That's right!

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.806
Okay, okay! Don't belabour it.
I get it. I get it.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.585
I don't fit on Beekman Place,
that's what's really wrong.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.555
- You think that's what I'm talking--
- Yes!

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.435
No demands, just fun, laughs.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.120
Good! Go! Go have a good time
on Beekman Place.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.628
You wanna end it like
a gentleman, you have. So get out!

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.511
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.320
I'm calm now, Hubbell.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.920
You can go.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.120
It's me.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.120
Hubbell....

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.209
Wait a minute, hold on.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.320
Don't go away.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.985
Listen, Hubbell...

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.120
...this is kind of peculiar.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.755
I know that I don't have to apologize
for what I said because...

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.646
...I know that you know.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And...

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.155
...I also know that you...

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.275
...you know that I don't feel exactly
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed...

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.935
...as J.J. would say.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.120
Anyway, the peculiar thing is...

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.320
...it's really a request,
you know, a favour.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.775
You see, I can't sleep, Hubbell...

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.960
...it would help me so much
if you could....

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.920
Well, if I had someone to talk to.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.052
You know, if I had a best
friend or something...

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.123
...to talk about it with.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.997
Only you're my best friend.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.480
Isn't that dumb?

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.880
So dumb.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.695
You're the best friend I ever had.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:53.342
It would help me so much if you'd
come over and see me through tonight.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.555
Hubbell, I promise
I won't touch you...

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.120
...or beg you...

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.120
...or embarrass you.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:08.403
But I have to talk to my best
friend about someone we both know.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.837
So could-- Hubbell, could you please
come over right away, please?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.308
There's some sleeping pills
in the cabinet.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.200
Here.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.828
Isn't one enough?

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920
No.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.120
I'm scared.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.760
Take them.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.658
Will you stay till I fall asleep?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.320
I'm really sorry.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.926
But that's what
best friends are for.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.640
Aren't they?

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.335
There's something I wanna ask you.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.715
Hope this doesn't make me drunk
instead of sleepy.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.760
Don't drink it like water.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.597
Is it because I'm not
attractive enough?

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.338
I'm not fishing, really. I'm not.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.120
I know I'm attractive.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.720
Sort of.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120
But...

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.868
...I'm not attractive in the--

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.689
I'm not attractive in the right way.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.920
Am I?

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.120
I mean...

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.215
...I don't have the right style...

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.120
...for you.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960
Do I?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.439
Be my friend.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.145
You don't have the right style.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.200
I'll change.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.675
Don't. You're your own girl.
You have your own style.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.635
But then I won't have you.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.000
Why can't I have you? Why?

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.319
Because you push too hard.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.520
Every damn minute.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.835
There's no time to relax
and enjoy living.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.803
Everything's too serious.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.115
I push too hard because
I want things to be better.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.755
I want us to be better,
you to be better.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.955
Sure I make waves, you have to.
I'll keep making them...

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.234
...till you're everything
you should be.

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:24.755
You'll never find anyone to believe
in you this much or love you as much.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.755
- I know that.
- Well then, why?

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.755
You think if I come back it'll
be okay by magic?

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.354
What'll be different?

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:35.862
- We'll be wrong. We'll both lose.
- Couldn't we both win?

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:43.515
I like Hollywood. I like Alice Faye.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.720
Don't. Don't. No, please.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.320
Somebody's getting up.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.665
Aren't you sleepy?

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.600
You are.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.120
I'm exhausted.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.480
Katie, you expect so much.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.757
Oh, but look what I've got.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.515
Jesus! Your director lives here?

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.715
Actually, he lives off the garage.
The servants live here.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.155
How can he work here?

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.155
Bissinger doesn't work,
he's the director.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:01.046
As long as you're writing in
France by next fall, I don't care.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.555
- Everybody's here.
- Everybody who's anybody.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.235
- No ice skating rink?
- It's in the cellar.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.715
- Hubbell!
- Hi, George.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.115
George Bissinger.
Glad you came.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.360
My wife, Vicki.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.595
- How are you?
- It's Kate, isn't it?

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.595
It's Katie.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.075
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.400
Rhea!

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.315
I want you to meet my agent.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.435
Reportedly the greatest in town.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.475
If I were a great agent,
would I be an agent?

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.675
- Nice to meet you.
- You think those are croquet balls...

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.275
...but it's her collection
of shrunken heads.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.155
Have you seen the
Bissinger collection?

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.555
You think these Hollywood intellectuals
plan to overthrow the government?

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.635
They couldn't overthrow
Louella Parsons.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.515
In '37, in Munich,
Hitler was a joke too.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.195
Paula Reisner,
our resident pessimist.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.600
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.338
They're coming to investigate
all us communist subversives.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.515
They're out to get election yardage
from the silver screen.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.555
They're getting people
to testify secretly.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.680
Horses' asses.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.035
Maybe. But we can't even write our
congressman. He's on the committee.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.465
Your shot, George.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.435
- Alice in Wonderland. Come on.
- Thank you.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.115
You're not home
making the script brilliant?

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.355
Listen to the producer.
You don't even understand it.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.755
I'm glad you came.
I was gonna call you.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.315
I'm giving J.J. a birthday party.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.275
- 45, huh?
- You gotta come as a Marx Brother.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.628
- K-K-Katie, you could come as Karl.
- Still stuttering?

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.915
I'm not coming as Groucho.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.806
Come as Harpo, that way you
won't be able to talk.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.898
I think your director's an idiot.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.560
Too high? Too low?

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.635
Trying to tell me something?

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.680
What? He's here?
In the room? Good God!

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.635
Ten years in Leavenworth, 11 years in
Twelveworth, or 5 and 10 in Woolworth.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.715
--to control thought.
Censorship.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.435
Let's not dramatize this.
It'll all blow over.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.235
- That line is necessary.
- It's the point of the whole scene.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.275
The point's made by the
dancers in red, white and blue.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.235
There are no dancers in his book.
You can't just have dancers.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.235
Please.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.155
Brooks, if we get this organized,
you've got to talk.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.755
- I can't talk in front--
- Come on, Brooks.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.715
- It's gorgeous if you do.
- I'll write, all right?

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.435
He doesn't understand.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.155
- I never liked his movies anyway.
- "Honk-honk," said the duck.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.355
You rang?
Your wish is my command.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.035
This morning I shot
an elephant in my pyjamas....

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.435
- What are you hungry for?
- I'm hungry for your absence.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.235
--meeting at my house Sunday.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.795
- George, is Paula Reisner a Red?
- My heavens, I don't know. Why?

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.835
- It's something I heard.
- You listen to the wrong people.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.111
Come on. I have an early day.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.415
- He thinks Bissinger's right.
- How dare you--

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.715
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.222
Could you stop?
This is coming out in French.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.155
Maybe Bissinger will like it
better in French.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.520
Taste this.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.120
How is it?

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.120
It's great.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.155
I'll study French cooking while
you finish your novel.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.354
Done much thinking about it?

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.760
No, not much.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.729
Well, it's very hard here, you know.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.235
But when we're ensconced
in our villa....

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.235
How about you? Have you read
any good books lately?

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.075
No, but I wrote two reports of books
that haven't been written yet.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.235
- You'll get the sack.
- I'll go back to brain surgery.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.075
They never read my synopses anyway.
They just pay me for them.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.675
Why don't you quit? After all, it's--

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.155
I'm laying a nice
nest egg for France.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.235
- Italy.
- France.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.588
- Spain?
- Never.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.155
China, maybe.
My phony synopsis takes place there.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.520
China?

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.995
Public's fed up with Westerns, Myrna.
High time we had an Eastern.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.040
Got a title?

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.760
Shevuos! Exclamation point.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.080
Sounds catchy.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:47.435
There's a kibbutz of Chinese Jews
living in a rice paddy.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.403
- And he--?
- No, she cooks communist rice patties.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.235
He gets the idea--

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.280
Of calling them matzos.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.555
You read the book!

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.920
Backwards.

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.052
Oh, I got one for you.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.323
I can't take another one.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.480
Loudmouthed Jewish girl...

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.395
...from New York City,
comes to Malibu, California...

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:13.055
- ...tells her gorgeous goyisher guy...
- Good alliteration.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.560
...that she's pregnant, you see.
And...

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.200
...and he just looks at her and....

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.520
Are you kidding?

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.803
- Don't be afraid to touch.
- I'm not.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Get it, Katie, sweetheart!

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.520
All right, one more time.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.675
- Hungry?
- Answer the question!

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:17.595
You have no right
to make me name the names--

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.400
Sergeant! Take the witness away.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.275
You've just heard
excerpts from today's...

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.755
...session of the
House Un-American....

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.755
- I'll make the salad.
- Thank you.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.235
Watch out, the paint
takes forever to dry.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.475
- You'll be in Beverly Hills by then.
- France, not Beverly Hills.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.155
Not if Hubbell gets
the deal I'm working on.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.200
What deal?

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.915
Three more pictures. Provided this one
works out of course.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.795
- Think he's interested?
- I certainly hope so.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.302
It'll mean a lot more money, Kate.
You and Hubbell could live in style.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.409
I thought we did, Rhea.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.915
Pop sent me a list of names.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.675
"For my grandson, the following
names are okay with me:

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.720
Thomas Jefferson Gardiner,
Solomon David Gardiner...

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.320
...and Eugene V. Debs Gardiner."

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.355
What if it's a girl?

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.555
If it's a girl, there's only
one name, my mother's.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.985
Yeah, what's that?

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.520
Rachel.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.111
So keep your fingers crossed.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.275
What's this picture about?

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.960
Cowboys and Indians.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.355
Not too loud. Brooks wrote it.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.875
- Tonight, the Indians are the good guys.
- Can you do that?

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.155
Well, it's un-American,
but we can try.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.795
I think I'm calm enough.
Vicki, let's start.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:12.835
Don't try the trick with the sunglasses.
I know when you're sleeping.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.115
--the best Western I've ever read.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.520
I mean it.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.435
There they are.
Hey, Velez and Yolanda.

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:23.075
- I saved you guys a seat.
- Thank you.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.155
- We didn't miss anything, did we?
- All right, Floyd.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.920
- How's my godchild?
- Very happy.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.200
My God.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.920
What the hell is going on?

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.723
- What did it, George?
- Your Picasso!

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.262
What's the trouble?

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.640
Testing. Do you get us?

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.960
What the hell is going on?

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.120
We're being recorded.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.075
- Would you knock it off up there?
- Floyd, stop it!

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.155
Can't hear me.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.120
Floyd, hold it!

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.511
I'm going to sue the U.S.
government for that painting.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.915
We've got to do something.
Do you have a lawyer?

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.235
Shouldn't we let him know
what happened?

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.835
How do we know this room
isn't bugged too?

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:32.915
- This country wouldn't believe this.
- They'll never know about this.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.675
We can't let this happen.
We have rights.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:40.475
- Can't the studios do something?
- We have got to do something. We.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.035
Bissinger says this scene
isn't necessary.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.772
I told him he's wrong.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.720
What do you think?

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.955
- He's the director.
- You're the producer!

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.520
Easy, will you?

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.120
Yeah, easy.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.120
Hey, Hub.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.915
Do you know what's going on
over at your house?

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.955
Sure.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
You know?

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.755
Overthrowing the government,
I suppose.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.955
Let's see, Sunday's volleyball....

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.355
Yeah, they like to overthrow
the government on Monday.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.275
They're going to D.C.
to challenge the committee...

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.320
...on the basis of
the First Amendment.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
What?

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.720
Well, well.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.849
- Think anybody knows what it says?
- Katie does.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.320
That's for sure.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.395
Some actor comes up to me...

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:43.755
...and says this line
doesn't make any sense.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.875
What do you think?

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.195
If they go, it'll make more trouble.
They may not have jobs to come back to.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.163
What do you want from me?

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.391
Tell Katie to stay out of it.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.800
You tell her.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.200
I will.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.323
I'll buy tickets to that.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.275
Would you just tell her to go easy?

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.835
Sure. You tell Bissinger to go easy.
You're the producer.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.265
What's eating you?

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:12.720
Nothing. The war's over, right?

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.160
Movies....

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.520
Do you realize this is the first
job we've ever had?

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.755
Athletic Scholarship.
Doesn't that count?

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.415
Doesn't count, buddy.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.115
Well, then, Officer,
Landing Craft, South Pacific?

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160
Nope.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.428
Why? We got paid $150 a month.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.520
Doesn't count.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.120
- You want a drink?
- No.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:52.597
There's a little trouble at home.
I have to keep my wits about me.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.320
Old Carol Ann.

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.920
Don't take any crap.
To the both of us.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.920
And all the absent friends,
class of '37.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.475
- Is this the Gardiner house?
- And I'm the gardener.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.366
- How are you doing?
- Okay, so far--

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.515
Your lover chain smokes, no doubt to
compensate for his extreme shortness.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.115
He has an enormous heart
and no sense of humour.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.560
You found us out.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:41.035
Calls himself Brooks Kropatkin,
but it's not his real name.

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.080
- What is it?
- Carpenter.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.431
Carpenter! Who told you that?

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.755
J.J. With whom I was not drinking...

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.800
...since he no longer drinks
due to trouble at home.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.631
Well, Carol Ann's 33.
Not many moves left.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:58.182
Well, we're all 33, practically.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.560
Not you. Not the quiz kid.

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.991
What were you, 16 in college?

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.018
What's gonna happen?

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.837
You're going to Washington.

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.782
I meant with J.J. and Carol Ann.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.849
That's another house. In this house,
the wife is going to D.C.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.511
Gonna take the baby with you?

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.385
I thought I might.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:35.142
Nothing like an early education.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.315
I'd like her to learn
not to be frightened.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.400
Her?

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.600
Him.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.837
Why don't you come with us?

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.135
We're kind of back
where we started, aren't we?

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.803
That's not true, Hubbell.

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.040
Okay. Now why don't
we all stay home?

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.360
I can't.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.475
--and named the names of
14 of his fellow actors.

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.315
He described their
various associations...

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.675
...with subversive organizations.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.797
Ten men of the original 19
who refused to testify....

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.320
And there he is...

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:36.800
...Jack Armstrong,
the all-American boy.

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.295
- Hey, you look good.
- I hate it!

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.840
I like it!

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.040
Isn't she lovely?
America's sweetheart.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:59.515
Look at her go. I'd forgotten.
She really was getting to those people.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.252
Take a look at some of those faces.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.880
Oh, she was a spellbinder.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.883
I'd forgotten about that.

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.080
She's beautiful.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.360
I'm exhausted.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.075
Do you have any comment
regarding the Hollywood 10?

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.515
They're running toward martyrdom
for nothing but their own destruction.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.595
They're standing up for principle.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.995
If you don't like this
country, get out!

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.155
It's my country too!

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:50.662
They could've denied everything.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.298
They didn't want to.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.155
Can we do this
someplace else?

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.915
Why are you here?
You might get put on a list.

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.515
I refuse to be intimidated.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.155
Well, those 10 men feel
exactly the same way.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.200
Free speech is all
we're talking about.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.315
They're fighting for your right
to make any movie you want.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:13.129
And all you can do is strut
around here making simple remarks.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.875
Could we get a statement
from Mrs. Gardiner?

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.115
I'd like to ask these people
why they think we just fought a war.

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.840
What are you people afraid of?

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.655
Shut your mouth, you commie bitch!

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.557
You two wait here
till the crowd clears.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.080
Are you okay?

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.391
You're bleeding.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.080
I'm fine.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:18.194
It's always fun
meeting trains, you know?

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.080
I'm sorry, Hubbell.
I really didn't expect this.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:28.686
You didn't expect to get a chance
to tell off the world either.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:32.755
- Is that what you think I'm doing?
- You bet I do.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.108
I'm not telling off the world.

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.275
I'm just standing up
for something I believe in.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.515
You're not angry when
Bissinger ridicules those men?

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:44.795
Calling them martyrs because
they have guts...

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.915
...to fight for their Bill of Rights,
his Bill of Rights and yours!

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.475
We don't have any Bill of Rights.

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.675
We'll never have free speech.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:56.315
We never will if people
won't take a stand.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:59.515
We never will have because
people are scared.

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.120
This isn't college.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.395
This is grown-up politics, Katie.
And it's stupid and dangerous.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.275
You're telling me to shut up
because it's dangerous?

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.235
I'm telling you it's a waste.

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.875
And that those men
are only gonna get hurt.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:15.315
And that nothing is gonna change.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:18.035
And after jail,
after years of bad blood...

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:23.155
...when it's practical for a fascist
producer to hire a communist writer...

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.675
...because his movie's
in trouble, he'll do it.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:29.315
They'll make movies, have dinner,
they'll play tennis...

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.595
...make passes at each other's wives.
What did anybody go to jail for?

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.717
For what? A political spat?

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:41.275
You're telling me to close my eyes
and watch people being destroyed...

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.035
...so you can work in a town
that doesn't have spine enough...

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.275
...to stand up for
anything but a buck!

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.595
I'm telling you that people are more
important than a goddamn witch hunt.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.640
You and me. Not causes.
Not principles.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:58.320
Hubbell, people are their principles.

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:11.945
The heads of the studios have
reversed their positions...

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.680
...and any employee who...

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:19.995
...is an unfriendly witness
before the committee is...

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.280
...fired.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.280
Oh, Jesus.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.035
So now we have an official blacklist.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.715
It's an open season
for witch hunters...

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.400
...and stool pigeons.

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.795
And now the problem is,
how to convince the public...

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:42.160
...that a stool pigeon is a hero.

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:45.920
You are like these
damn palm trees.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:50.715
They don't belong here either.
They were brought in and they look it.

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:53.920
I'm sure that they
don't like it either.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:58.622
- What if he does, Paula?
- What is more important to you?

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.680
He is.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.480
That's your choice, Katie.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:13.280
- Give him my love too.
- I will.

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:15.080
Thanks, Paula.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.115
It's no reflection on anything
except that you're new to this...

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.920
...film technique.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:29.715
Especially for the novelist.
He's too close to his own material.

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.280
I'm not a novelist.

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.788
I'd like to think of myself...

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.355
...as a screenwriter.

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.475
I wanna be up front with you.

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.289
I know what changes have to be made.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.275
But can you make them?

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:50.166
Nobody else understands that story.
Nobody knows it. It's mine.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:51.840
Mine.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.715
I know where it came from.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.145
I know what the heart of it is.

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.275
You remember those few days
before the war started.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.240
Before we had to change--
You don't lose what I know about it.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.875
Work with me.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.715
Work with me closely, fine.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.395
And I know the dialogue from the book
is slowing the film up.

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.080
But I can fix that.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.680
I learn fast. I always have.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.880
Things come--

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.658
Christ, I can do it.

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.126
I know what you want.
I know what your concept is.

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.680
I'll make your changes.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.840
Let me.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.782
With no resistance?

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:55.640
No.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.400
No resistance.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.680
Bad times?

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:19.880
Can't be all bad.

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.545
How's the picture?

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.200
Troubled.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.717
I'm going back to New York.

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.080
New York.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.385
When do you leave?

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.942
Not until tomorrow.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.515
I'm getting rid of some things
in my apartment.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.480
There's some champagne.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.840
For bon voyage.

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:28.280
Well, it's getting better.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:29.880
Better....

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.680
It's most unusual.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.080
When it's slow, it seems
necessary to be slow.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.155
Of course, with the audience....

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:53.075
Thank you, Paula, my dear.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.915
I'll have my brandy in bed.

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:58.715
We'll conduct the postmortem tomorrow.
Good night, Paula...

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.675
...Hubbell, J.J., silent Kate.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.643
Thank you, Floyd.
Thank you very much.

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.760
Good night, Mr. Bissinger.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:14.635
J.J., shall we go and have some wine?
You will tell me your problems...

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.600
...and I'll tell you how the
un-American gentlemen...

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.080
...offered to give me some names
to name in Washington.

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.080
Take care, darling.

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.948
True to life.
So true to life.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:36.545
I'll be up late, case you guys wanna
stop by on your way to the beach.

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.880
Well, that was a gripping experience.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.720
"So true to life, darling."

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:01.035
The only picture she
hasn't knocked is Potemkin.

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.795
Probably a dyke anyway.

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.763
She is not.
She has two grandchildren.

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.458
Katie, the day you die,
you'll still be a nice Jewish girl.

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.418
Are you still a nice gentile boy?

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.280
I never was.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.166
I only looked it to you.

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.755
- That's not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:41.235
When you love someone, from Roosevelt
to me, you go deaf, dumb and blind.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.880
Not blind, Hubbell.

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.280
And certainly not dumb.

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:01.680
Who told you?

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.280
A friend.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.280
Some friend.

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:13.555
Well, it's a friendly town...

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.831
...if you don't mind having
your friends inform on you.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.778
I suppose you'll say
it doesn't mean anything.

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.120
It doesn't.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.595
Your picture will be a smash, Hubbell.
Congratulations.

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:35.480
But you didn't like it.

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.237
Let's say I appreciated it.

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.555
What didn't you like?

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.369
Are you finished for the night, sir?

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:56.560
Yes.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:58.680
Thank you.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.982
Why did you have to go with her?

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.840
Tell me I'm not good enough.
Tell me I talk too much.

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:22.243
You don't like my perfume,
my family, my pot roast.

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:27.145
But you didn't have to go
back to Beekman Place, did you?

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.280
Katie, what's wrong with us...

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.160
...has nothing to do with another girl.

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.480
Oh, give up.

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:49.680
Please.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:55.600
I can't. I hate what
you did to your book.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.840
I hate the picture.

01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:01.235
I hate the palm trees.
I wish it would rain.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.880
Oh, I want....

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.480
I want....

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.760
What?

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.551
I want us to love each other.

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:09.515
Give me a beer.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.098
Coming up, skipper.
There you go.

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:16.515
What the hell. It doesn't
matter anyway. She wasn't much.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.275
Don't get sloppy.
You had some good days.

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.880
It's the rum.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.840
No excuse, buddy.

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.035
It's not like, you know...

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.120
...losing somebody like Katie.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.080
That would be a loss.

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.080
Best Saturday afternoon?

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.995
1933, when "Brute" Holland
was out with a bad knee.

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.040
Best month?

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.480
April.

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.480
Best year?

01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.880
Best year....

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.400
1944.

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.680
No, '45....

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:52.465
It's amazing how decisions
are forced on you willy-nilly.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.720
You never did want to finish
your book, did you?

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.080
I don't know.

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.406
I never thought there was much point.

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.197
And you never really wanted
to go to France, did you?

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:30.520
No, I didn't. You wanted me to.

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.680
Oh, boy.

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:39.120
Oh, girl.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.080
Are you all right?

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.766
Wouldn't it be lovely
if we were old?

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.194
We'd have survived all this.

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:02.675
Everything would be
easy and uncomplicated.

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:05.335
The way it was when we were young.

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.637
It was never uncomplicated.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.280
But it was lovely.

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:16.480
Wasn't it?

01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.440
Yeah. It was lovely.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.252
Will you do me one favour, Hubbell?

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:36.535
Stay with me till the baby's born?

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.409
More flowers for you, Mrs. Gardiner.

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:56.960
I thought....

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.960
- It's a nice room.
- Yeah, it is.

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:04.886
Did you get your father?

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:11.994
I'd like to call her Rachel.

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.440
Fine.

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.698
Did you see her yet?

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.480
She's little.

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:47.680
I've got the crib together.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.206
Oh, you don't have it ironed anymore!

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.858
- What?
- Your hair.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.160
No, I don't.

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.680
It's pretty.

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:33.960
Thank you.

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.117
Still married?

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.446
Sure. What are you
doing in New York?

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:43.114
I've been writing a TV show.

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:44.920
Really?

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:47.755
There's an experience.
It happens so fast.

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.155
Shoot it in one day,
live, on the air.

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.795
Everybody in a constant
state of panic.

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:54.917
You remember how radio was.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:55.995
Same thing...

01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.880
...only with cameras. And craziness!
Make a great comic novel.

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.754
It sounds wonderful, really.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.760
Your taxi's ready, sir.

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:13.995
I'm awfully late.
Please call and come for a drink?

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.155
It's the only David X. Cohen
in the book.

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.662
What's the "X" for?

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.569
The only David X. Cohen in the book.

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:27.195
I'm sorry I'm late.
How are we doing, huh?

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:30.115
Oh, wonderful.
We've got 122 on that one.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:32.715
And Charlene called.
She's doing great.

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.960
- Marvellous.
- Wonderful.

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:37.675
That's a good one too,
don't you think?

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:38.955
What about Eileen?

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
You never give up, do you?

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.212
Only when I'm absolutely forced to.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
But I'm a very good loser.

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:03.108
Better than I am.

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:06.428
Well, I've had...

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.920
...more practise.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.995
Your girl is lovely, Hubbell.

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.809
Bring her for a drink
when you come.

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.760
I can't come, Katie.

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:26.960
I can't.

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.760
I know.

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:08.600
How is she?

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.360
She is just beautiful.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.231
You would be so proud of her.

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:18.760
I'm glad.

01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:24.178
Is he a good father?

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.520
Yes. Very.

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.040
Good.

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.400
See you, Katie.

01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.560
See you, Hubbell.

01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:09.760
Ban the bomb!

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:15.209
Join the thousands of Americans
who are protesting the use....
