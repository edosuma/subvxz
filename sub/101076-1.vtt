(suspenseful music)

00:59.487 --> 01:02.135
- [Doctor] We can't overlook
that age is a factor here,

01:02.135 --> 01:04.584
particularly in recovery time.

01:04.584 --> 01:06.793
Have you been taking any pain medications?

01:06.793 --> 01:08.376
- [Jane] Ibuprofen.

01:09.331 --> 01:10.872
- [Doctor] Any history of opioid use?

01:10.872 --> 01:11.872
- No.

01:12.946 --> 01:14.393
- [Doctor] Well, I'm
surprised you can manage it.

01:14.393 --> 01:18.380
The nerve impingement alone
has got to be very painful.

01:19.305 --> 01:20.457
How about sensation?

01:20.457 --> 01:22.495
Still having numbness in the fingers?

01:22.495 --> 01:25.662
- It takes a couple days to come back.

01:26.526 --> 01:29.443
- [Doctor] Well, soon it might not.

01:30.726 --> 01:32.226
- [Jane] How soon?

(audience applauding)

01:38.481 --> 01:41.064

01:47.906 --> 01:49.029

01:49.029 --> 01:50.249

01:50.249 --> 01:51.377

- Your aerial career.
- Mm.

07:54.203 --> 07:57.370

07:58.372 --> 08:00.789
(Jane sighs)

08:03.264 --> 08:04.468
Life starts at flight,

08:04.468 --> 08:06.424
that makes for a great headline, actually.

08:06.424 --> 08:09.454
But there is a gap from
your gymnastics career.

08:09.454 --> 08:10.783
- Yeah, well, you did your homework,

08:10.783 --> 08:13.136
so you know how that ends.

08:13.136 --> 08:15.594

08:15.594 --> 08:16.791
Hey, you know what, I'm so sorry,

08:16.791 --> 08:19.837
I just realized that I
have to go do something.

08:19.837 --> 08:22.670

09:23.181 --> 09:24.667

09:24.667 --> 09:26.972
- Oh, I thought I'd give them
a day to settle in, at least.

09:26.972 --> 09:28.256
- We don't have time to settle in.

09:28.256 --> 09:29.975

09:33.272 --> 09:34.272

09:41.405 --> 09:42.697

- Chief, this will take

09:48.605 --> 09:49.438

- Yeah, well, they're

09:49.438 --> 09:50.271

10:03.959 --> 10:05.302

10:05.302 --> 10:06.260

10:06.260 --> 10:07.593
Yes.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.076

10:11.076 --> 10:12.014

10:12.014 --> 10:13.261

- Yeah.

10:21.376 --> 10:23.137
Okay, let's do it again.

10:23.137 --> 10:26.137

10:41.552 --> 10:43.161
Yes!

10:43.161 --> 10:45.078

10:56.815 --> 10:58.190
Hathaway, would you--
- I know, have they?

10:58.190 --> 10:59.681
- Would you have them
run through this please?

10:59.681 --> 11:00.572
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

11:00.572 --> 11:01.756
- Hey, you guys, do it again.

11:01.756 --> 11:05.673
Stay low, please, and
don't do anything stupid.

11:07.236 --> 11:10.058
- She's ready, but,
look, it's your decision.

11:10.058 --> 11:12.404
I just need to make this happen now.

11:12.404 --> 11:13.872
Yeah, we're gonna have to go to,

11:13.872 --> 11:16.806
like, plan B or plan C
or whatever the fuck.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.051
And I was just in there and I almost was,

11:18.051 --> 11:20.051
like, passing out, so...

11:21.020 --> 11:21.853
Of course.

11:24.315 --> 11:25.396
All right.

11:25.396 --> 11:26.979
Thank you, Richard.

11:30.603 --> 11:32.150
I'm sorry.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.150
- It's fine.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.623
- It's not, it's back.

11:44.626 --> 11:47.972
I'm out here smoking like
it's the fucking cure.

11:47.972 --> 11:50.193
(Spencer groans)

11:50.193 --> 11:52.309
- [Jane] Does Aurora know?

11:52.309 --> 11:54.853
- [Spencer] You know how
spooked she gets before a tour.

11:54.853 --> 11:55.686
- Spencer.

11:57.623 --> 12:00.181
- I just told Richard, though.

12:00.181 --> 12:02.662
Fuck, I thought I could get
you guys through rehearsals.

12:02.662 --> 12:03.671
- You don't have to.

12:03.671 --> 12:05.166
We got this.

12:05.166 --> 12:05.999
- What about you?

12:05.999 --> 12:07.666
Are you up for this?

12:08.922 --> 12:09.813
How's the body?

12:09.813 --> 12:10.730
- I'm fine.

12:17.254 --> 12:18.837
- I'm scared, Jane.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.832
- [Jane] Come on, come on.

12:21.832 --> 12:25.249
- We've survived the road and each other,

12:26.709 --> 12:29.982
and we've thrived on the
road with each other.

12:29.982 --> 12:33.374
It's been the greatest
experience of my life

12:33.374 --> 12:35.812
to be part of this family.

12:35.812 --> 12:39.593
But you guys are all gonna have
to go out there without me.

12:39.593 --> 12:40.901
I'm sorry.

12:40.901 --> 12:42.625
But I know you can handle it.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.625
You're all well-behaved.

12:46.196 --> 12:47.618
I'm not looking at you, Hathaway.

12:47.618 --> 12:50.201
(all laughing)

12:53.733 --> 12:57.824
But if there are, like, any
squabbles going forward,

12:57.824 --> 13:00.741
Jane is now senior officer on deck.

13:08.536 --> 13:11.806
Okay, got my cigs, I'm
gonna go stand on a beach.

13:11.806 --> 13:12.867
- We're gonna go with you.

13:12.867 --> 13:13.952
- No arguments.

13:13.952 --> 13:15.906
- Yeah.
- Paloma, stay and rehearse.

13:15.906 --> 13:18.589
I can't stand in for your
mama anymore, darling.

13:18.589 --> 13:19.862
- I can rehearse on a beach.

13:19.862 --> 13:20.820
- Hey, we all can rehearse

13:20.820 --> 13:21.873
on the beach.
- Yeah.

13:21.873 --> 13:24.244
Come on.
- I'll bring the music.

13:24.244 --> 13:27.869
(all laughing)
(Hathaway grunts)

13:27.869 --> 13:29.302
- [Jane] We love you so much.

13:29.302 --> 13:30.719
Love you so much.

13:31.991 --> 13:32.983
- [Spencer] All right, enough, please.

13:32.983 --> 13:34.826
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

13:34.826 --> 13:36.967
(all laughing)

13:36.967 --> 13:39.189
- [Jane] Get him, get him.

13:39.189 --> 13:41.335
- Grab my boots.
(Spencer groans)

13:41.335 --> 13:42.585
(Spencer coughing)

13:42.585 --> 13:43.709
- [Jamal] Bring wine.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.833
Please bring the wine.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.132
- Oh, something's come
up, I can't do tonight.

13:48.132 --> 13:50.215
Can we do tomorrow night?

13:51.881 --> 13:53.431
- [Spencer] You guys wanted
out of rehearsals, right?

13:53.431 --> 13:54.545
(all laughing)

13:54.545 --> 13:55.948
- [Jamal] Good excuse.

13:55.948 --> 13:58.531
(gentle music)

14:29.262 --> 14:31.929
(foot thudding)

14:34.912 --> 14:37.493
(lock clicks)

14:37.493 --> 14:38.900
- Hey.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.067
- [Paloma] Hi.

14:41.154 --> 14:42.711
- I thought the dancers were assigned

14:42.711 --> 14:44.353
the same rooms as last time.

14:44.353 --> 14:46.275
- Oh, well, Jane's letting me stay here

14:46.275 --> 14:48.106
so I don't have to drive back to the 'Bu.

14:48.106 --> 14:49.698
- Oh.

14:49.698 --> 14:52.198
And so where is Jane crashing?

14:53.349 --> 14:55.432
- She didn't tell me.

15:05.547 --> 15:07.547
- I barely recognize it.

15:09.478 --> 15:11.377
- Sure this is the place?

15:11.377 --> 15:13.544
- My eyes aren't that bad.

15:23.642 --> 15:26.681
- [Serena] Seven, one, three, two.

15:26.681 --> 15:28.211
(lock clicks)

15:28.211 --> 15:29.477
(key jingling)

15:29.477 --> 15:30.500
(box clatters)

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
- [Jane] Ow.

15:33.120 --> 15:33.953
- Hey.

15:35.832 --> 15:38.582
That little cut is not the issue.

15:44.025 --> 15:47.358
You could barely hold
your knife at dinner.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.590
You should go see the gal
that put me back together.

15:51.590 --> 15:54.507
- She can put things back together?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.371
- I'll give her a call.

15:58.363 --> 15:59.780
I'll hook you up.

16:00.702 --> 16:01.619
- I'm fine.

16:03.119 --> 16:05.312
- If you're the director now,

16:05.312 --> 16:08.311
you can take the time to recover.

16:08.311 --> 16:11.306
There were no aerials
in the show before you.

16:11.306 --> 16:13.436
You made this show.

16:13.436 --> 16:15.714
- It's a family effort.

16:15.714 --> 16:18.464
- Wouldn't take this
family stuff too seriously,

16:18.464 --> 16:21.076
especially with Richard.

16:21.076 --> 16:22.493
- He's all right.

16:26.911 --> 16:28.078
You coming in?

16:29.150 --> 16:30.900
- I got a long drive.

16:33.980 --> 16:34.813
Oh.

16:37.439 --> 16:40.522
(cellphone clicking)

16:41.426 --> 16:42.259
Call her.

16:45.050 --> 16:47.087
Walk me to my car?

16:47.087 --> 16:49.920
(Serena groaning)

16:56.800 --> 16:58.455
(car door clacks)

16:58.455 --> 17:01.205
(car door thuds)

17:03.123 --> 17:04.455
I almost forgot.

17:09.246 --> 17:11.268
You're gonna wanna open the gift first,

17:11.268 --> 17:12.854
before you read the card.

17:12.854 --> 17:14.398
- Okay.

17:14.398 --> 17:16.625
- And don't worry, it's not a knife.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.458
I moved on from those.

17:19.708 --> 17:22.540
(engine whirring)

17:36.762 --> 17:39.345
(gentle music)

17:56.442 --> 17:58.692
(knocking)

18:01.363 --> 18:02.654
- Are you kidding me?!

18:02.654 --> 18:03.737
- [Jane] Dan.

18:04.633 --> 18:07.563
- Ah, I'm practically cutting
myself on your biceps,

18:07.563 --> 18:09.526
so you must be real.
(Jane laughs)

18:09.526 --> 18:13.359
I wasn't surprised not to
see you at the funeral,

18:13.359 --> 18:15.820
but I thought, "Just maybe."

18:15.820 --> 18:19.404
- Well, even if I wanted to
go, Gayle wasn't having it.

18:19.404 --> 18:23.642
- Oh, the new wife is always
leery of the old wife, I guess.

18:23.642 --> 18:24.721
- Leery?

18:24.721 --> 18:26.629
She sent lawyers after me.

18:26.629 --> 18:27.462
- Oh.

18:27.462 --> 18:29.228
- She was surprised to discover

18:29.228 --> 18:30.851
my name was still on the title.

18:30.851 --> 18:32.130
- [Dan] That explains it.

18:32.130 --> 18:33.341
- [Jane] Explains what?

18:33.341 --> 18:35.251
- When she came to clear out their things,

18:35.251 --> 18:38.361
I caught her trying to throw
out a box of your stuff.

18:38.361 --> 18:39.319
- I have stuff?

18:39.319 --> 18:42.331
- Just old documents, gymnastic medals,

18:42.331 --> 18:44.312
I put them back in the attic.

18:44.312 --> 18:46.004
- She thought I owed David something.

18:46.004 --> 18:48.127
- So now you owe her something?

18:48.127 --> 18:48.960
- But what?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.184
The house?

18:50.184 --> 18:51.339
No.

18:51.339 --> 18:56.006
- They haven't lived here in
forever, so don't sweat it.

18:57.783 --> 18:59.406
- He didn't hate me?

18:59.406 --> 19:00.239
- No.

19:02.104 --> 19:02.937
To David.

19:06.024 --> 19:07.350
- To David.

19:07.350 --> 19:08.183
(glasses clink)

19:08.183 --> 19:10.766
(gentle music)

19:12.992 --> 19:15.492

20:12.302 --> 20:14.552

20:25.170 --> 20:27.700
It's a special effects shot.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.256
Ooh.
- Yeah, and you know what,

20:29.256 --> 20:31.342
it's only our second night,
really, of performing.

20:31.342 --> 20:34.520
- I'm zooming.
- I'm zooming myself in.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.353

22:21.327 --> 22:22.947
- I understand that this is hard.

22:22.947 --> 22:24.914
- Yeah, 'cause it doesn't take a genius.

22:24.914 --> 22:25.853
Look at me.

I'm not her, I'm nothing

22:36.646 --> 22:39.323
- Paloma, you used to sing like a bird.

22:39.323 --> 22:42.204
- Yeah, but I don't anymore, all right?

22:42.204 --> 22:43.037
That's her thing.

22:43.037 --> 22:44.170
She owns that thing.

22:44.170 --> 22:46.551
- What, all right, let's leave
that at the door, all right?

22:46.551 --> 22:49.037
This is a job, so step up.

22:49.037 --> 22:50.262

22:50.262 --> 22:52.512
we all drag our feet, okay?

22:53.708 --> 22:55.410
- But why do I have to sing?

22:55.410 --> 22:56.312
What is the point of that?

22:56.312 --> 22:58.236
- Because you've gotta engage,

22:58.236 --> 23:02.460
you've to do it all, that's the act, okay?

23:02.460 --> 23:05.627
This isn't for her, it's for us, okay?

23:08.655 --> 23:09.488

- We've been in the air enough.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.076
Come on.

24:33.076 --> 24:34.635
- My boys will take care of that.

24:34.635 --> 24:37.072
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, join in, join in.

24:37.072 --> 24:40.384
57 candles, if you must report the truth.

24:40.384 --> 24:42.264
- Oh, I can leave that part out.

24:42.264 --> 24:44.353
- Oh, that's all right, I don't care.

24:44.353 --> 24:45.228
- [Runa] You got a cut?

24:45.228 --> 24:46.235
- Huh? Oh, yeah.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.594
It's nothing.

24:47.594 --> 24:48.665
Hey!

24:48.665 --> 24:50.779
What's happening?
(performers cheering)

24:50.779 --> 24:52.210
- It's Jane's birthday!

24:52.210 --> 24:53.524
- Oh, my god!

24:53.524 --> 24:56.565
- [Bubba] Jane, come over here.

24:56.565 --> 24:58.069
- It's my birthday.

24:58.069 --> 24:58.902
570 years!

25:00.953 --> 25:02.883
- Call the fire department.

25:02.883 --> 25:04.039
- [T-Bone] That's a crazy family

25:04.039 --> 25:05.053
we got here.
- Yeah, I love it.

25:05.053 --> 25:08.188
(performers cheering)

25:08.188 --> 25:10.086
- I turned and I looked and it was Jane.

25:10.086 --> 25:12.374
And even though she fell flat on her face,

25:12.374 --> 25:15.202
she still came off stage
and said, "Good show."

25:15.202 --> 25:16.931
(performers laughing)
- Oh, I was there.

25:16.931 --> 25:18.616
- Oh, I was there.

25:18.616 --> 25:21.794
- But, you know, Jane only
had a small wild phase.

25:21.794 --> 25:24.192
And maybe only made one mistake.

25:24.192 --> 25:25.934
- Mm-hm.
- Several times.

25:25.934 --> 25:27.666
- Oh, yeah.
- Just the one, one mistake,

25:27.666 --> 25:29.307
but more than once.
- Several times.

25:29.307 --> 25:30.456
- Yeah.

25:30.456 --> 25:31.779
- [Iris] But again and again.

25:31.779 --> 25:33.529
- Uh, can I help you?

25:34.797 --> 25:36.347
- I was supposed to wait for Richard,

25:36.347 --> 25:39.680
but wanted to see how you guys rehearse.

25:41.880 --> 25:42.797
I'm Xavier.

25:44.033 --> 25:45.283
Zee, for short.

25:48.260 --> 25:50.879
I'm gonna be taking over for Spencer.

25:50.879 --> 25:52.504
- Like hell you are.

25:52.504 --> 25:56.050
- Yeah, should've waited for Richard.

25:56.050 --> 25:58.063
Look, I just want you guys to know

25:58.063 --> 26:01.432
that I am a big fan of Spencer's work.

26:01.432 --> 26:04.736
He did some cool stuff back in the day.

26:04.736 --> 26:07.784
And I get his style, so
this will go seamless.

26:07.784 --> 26:08.907
- This is so not happening.

26:08.907 --> 26:10.546
- Wait, I thought Jane was director now.

26:10.546 --> 26:12.188
- Yeah.

26:12.188 --> 26:14.021
- You're Jane Hawkins?

26:17.550 --> 26:21.383
I've been looking forward
to working with you.

26:23.554 --> 26:26.054
(door clacks)

26:30.392 --> 26:31.642
Happy birthday.

26:40.353 --> 26:42.184
- Richard, I don't
understand your thinking.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.786
- It should be Jane directing, if anybody.

26:43.786 --> 26:45.694
- This guy is like throwing a wrench

26:45.694 --> 26:48.406
into a well-oiled machine.
- Who is he, anyway?

26:48.406 --> 26:49.772
I've never even heard of him.

26:49.772 --> 26:52.187
- Who cares about who he
is and where he came from?

26:52.187 --> 26:53.687
We don't need him.

27:04.298 --> 27:06.123
- You a roadie?

27:06.123 --> 27:09.372
(T-Bone chuckles)

27:09.372 --> 27:11.122
- Concert technician.

27:15.538 --> 27:16.621
- Who's that?

27:20.394 --> 27:22.232
- That's a reporter.

27:22.232 --> 27:25.171
And she is not going to
give a shit about you.

27:25.171 --> 27:27.485
She's here for Jane.

27:27.485 --> 27:31.505
And the other one is the
daughter, you know, the daughter,

27:31.505 --> 27:35.619
someone I raised since
she slept in road cases.

27:35.619 --> 27:38.630
Please, don't even think of going there.

27:38.630 --> 27:39.880
Capiche, amigo?

27:41.102 --> 27:41.935
- Richard, come on.

27:41.935 --> 27:43.080
She has more experience

27:43.080 --> 27:44.320
than anybody.
- She has enough

27:44.320 --> 27:46.121
on her plate already.

27:46.121 --> 27:47.806
Her solo's a big part of the act,

27:47.806 --> 27:50.646
she manages all the
aerials, deals with safety.

27:50.646 --> 27:52.431
It's just too much to--
- I can deal with safety--

27:52.431 --> 27:54.764
- Ask her to, let me finish.

27:57.185 --> 28:02.185
Just too much to ask because
this is not just another tour,

28:02.484 --> 28:03.567
so we don't want to give the fans

28:03.567 --> 28:08.039
just the same well-oiled
machine, but some real surprises,

28:08.039 --> 28:11.091
and some fresh blood is
gonna help us do that.

28:11.091 --> 28:12.315
Come on, we have to open our arms here,

28:12.315 --> 28:13.409
and let some new family in,

28:13.409 --> 28:17.076
especially now that
Spencer's stepping away.

28:18.692 --> 28:21.928
Come on, let's just commit
to putting on a show

28:21.928 --> 28:25.440
that everyone will remember
for the rest of their lives.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.273
Okay?

28:28.492 --> 28:29.325
Jane?

28:32.698 --> 28:34.281
- Does Aurora know?

28:36.333 --> 28:37.166
- Yes.

28:38.810 --> 28:39.893
- Okay, then.

28:43.425 --> 28:47.654
- So, let me see what you've
been rehearsing up there.

28:47.654 --> 28:49.298
- Oh, we spent all morning in the air.

28:49.298 --> 28:50.718
We're done.

28:50.718 --> 28:53.218
- Ah, but you've been resting,

28:54.134 --> 28:56.661
partying, arguing about me.

28:56.661 --> 28:57.870
(Xavier chuckles)

28:57.870 --> 28:58.703
Come on.

28:58.703 --> 29:00.157
Let me see it.

29:00.157 --> 29:00.990
Please.

29:03.679 --> 29:04.596
- You good?

29:05.614 --> 29:07.281
- Yeah.
- Okay, then.

29:09.243 --> 29:10.984
- [Jane] One.

29:10.984 --> 29:13.183
♪ The hardest part of leaving ♪

29:13.183 --> 29:14.016
- [Jane] Two.

29:14.016 --> 29:14.969
♪ But you can return ♪

29:14.969 --> 29:17.130
♪ The hardest part of leaving ♪

29:17.130 --> 29:18.905

29:27.248 --> 29:30.408
(Xavier clapping)

29:30.408 --> 29:31.241
- That was great.

29:31.241 --> 29:32.324
Really great.

29:34.132 --> 29:35.738
Just want to try something, though.

29:35.738 --> 29:36.571
What's your name?

29:36.571 --> 29:37.744
- Iris.

29:37.744 --> 29:40.279
- I want you to switch with Hathaway.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.013
Can they switch positions?

29:43.013 --> 29:43.996
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:43.996 --> 29:45.136
- Don't have to run the
whole thing, just want to see

29:45.136 --> 29:46.886
what this looks like.

29:48.706 --> 29:51.706
It's just those abs and those abs...

29:55.379 --> 29:57.546
Creating symmetry, people.

30:00.487 --> 30:02.060
Okay, thank you. Let's run it.

30:02.060 --> 30:05.678
Jane, can you have Iris
hang on the hang thing

30:05.678 --> 30:07.095
for just, like, two eights more?

30:07.095 --> 30:08.206
Just till we hit blackout.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.343
- [Jane] The meat hook?

30:09.343 --> 30:10.827
- Yeah.

30:10.827 --> 30:11.744
I love you.

30:16.371 --> 30:19.038
- [Jane] Okay, and music please.

30:20.232 --> 30:21.415
- I'm Zee.

30:21.415 --> 30:23.665
- Runa.
- Seven, eight, one.

30:24.581 --> 30:26.859
♪ The hardest part of leaving ♪

30:26.859 --> 30:28.597
- [Jane] Two.

30:28.597 --> 30:30.492

30:30.492 --> 30:32.565

- Yeah.

30:32.565 --> 30:34.640
♪ The hardest part of leaving ♪

30:34.640 --> 30:35.677
- You okay?

30:35.677 --> 30:36.510
Iris.

30:36.510 --> 30:37.404
Oh, my god.

30:37.404 --> 30:38.677
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my god, oh, my god.

30:38.677 --> 30:40.001
Oh, my god.
- Iris.

30:40.001 --> 30:42.393
Move for me, move for me.

30:42.393 --> 30:43.926
- [Bianca] You okay?

30:43.926 --> 30:44.996
Are you sure?

30:44.996 --> 30:49.154
- [Hathaway] Just knocked
the air out of you.

30:49.154 --> 30:51.799
(Iris crying)

30:51.799 --> 30:52.785
- [Jamal] Oh, Iris.

30:52.785 --> 30:54.785
- [Bianca] Oh, my god.

30:56.541 --> 30:58.909
- Hey, this is a closed set.

30:58.909 --> 31:00.840
- I thought--
- Not a word of this gets out,

31:00.840 --> 31:02.590
or all access is cut.

31:04.734 --> 31:05.567
- Hey.

31:07.274 --> 31:09.774
Oh, come on, what's happening?

31:11.642 --> 31:13.642
Did that hurt that much?

31:15.021 --> 31:16.688
- It didn't hurt me.

31:21.765 --> 31:22.765
- Oh, honey.

31:25.338 --> 31:26.588
Oh, Iris, Iris.

31:37.738 --> 31:39.333
- [Xavier] So, she's good?

31:39.333 --> 31:41.083
- Yeah, she's pregnant,

31:41.083 --> 31:42.736
so we're gonna need to
make some adjustments.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.485
- [Xavier] Well, what do you
mean "make some adjustments"?

31:44.485 --> 31:45.663
Define "adjustments."

31:45.663 --> 31:47.542
- And another thing, when
I say we're done rehearsing

31:47.542 --> 31:49.509
in the air, we're done
rehearsing in the air.

31:49.509 --> 31:51.208
- Oh, hold on, I didn't
hire the pregnant lady.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.203
- She's six weeks.

31:52.203 --> 31:53.464
She didn't know she was gonna keep it.

31:53.464 --> 31:55.177
Now she knows, we can make some changes.

31:55.177 --> 31:56.010
- I'm sorry, no.

31:56.010 --> 31:57.744
That is definitely not happening.

31:57.744 --> 31:59.141
That is not a part of her contract

31:59.141 --> 32:00.972
and it's not a part of the show.

32:00.972 --> 32:05.972
Why are we even talking about
this, it's abs, abs, symmetry!

32:06.094 --> 32:07.832
- Okay, I might know a couple
of people who are available.

32:07.832 --> 32:09.416
- [Xavier] That's okay, I got this.

32:09.416 --> 32:11.885
- Wait, these are very specialized skills.

32:11.885 --> 32:13.847
There aren't very many
dancers who can do aerials,

32:13.847 --> 32:16.316
much less aerialists that can dance.

32:16.316 --> 32:17.983
- I said I got this.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.668
(door clacks)

32:21.668 --> 32:24.085
(Jane sighs)

32:26.111 --> 32:29.249
- You know, I was wondering
why you looked so good.

32:29.249 --> 32:31.045
- You remember Carmen
from the Brittany tour?

32:31.045 --> 32:32.736
- Mm-hm.
- She's got two kids now.

32:32.736 --> 32:33.674
- Right?
- You'll be fine.

32:33.674 --> 32:35.007
- I know.
- Iris.

32:36.011 --> 32:37.257
What size are you?

32:37.257 --> 32:39.056
- No, that motherfucker
is not trying to fit

32:39.056 --> 32:41.720
someone else into your costume.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.265
What the hell, man?

32:43.265 --> 32:46.384
- Hathaway, why do I think
we're gonna get along so great?

32:46.384 --> 32:47.801
- I have no idea.

32:50.506 --> 32:55.006
- Listen, I'm sorry that
Iris has to quit, and you do,

32:56.486 --> 32:59.589
and I know that everyone
wanted to celebrate,

32:59.589 --> 33:01.472
but now we're a person short,

33:01.472 --> 33:03.748
which means we have to find
and train a someone new,

33:03.748 --> 33:06.409
and this is not me
being insensitive, okay?

33:06.409 --> 33:08.791
She's known for, what, six weeks?

33:08.791 --> 33:10.403
- Dude, seriously.

33:10.403 --> 33:11.903
- Yeah, seriously.

33:12.888 --> 33:14.471
So what's her size?

33:15.943 --> 33:18.329
- A zero, obviously.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.329
- Thank you.

33:21.728 --> 33:23.735
Look, I'm just gonna put this all out here

33:23.735 --> 33:26.016
just so we're all on the same page:

33:26.016 --> 33:29.537
This show might've been a walk
in the park back in the day,

33:29.537 --> 33:31.072
but not this time.

33:31.072 --> 33:33.315
We are going to refresh the older numbers,

33:33.315 --> 33:38.123
we're gonna add some new
ones, so eat your Wheaties,

33:38.123 --> 33:41.096
lose some weight, drink your Ensure--

33:41.096 --> 33:42.718
- Hold up.

33:42.718 --> 33:44.385
"Drink your Ensure"?

33:46.510 --> 33:48.628
You Dunning-Kruger motherfucker.

33:48.628 --> 33:49.461
- Bianca.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.802
- You see what's he's doing, right?

33:50.802 --> 33:53.485
I mean, they didn't send him
in here to tweak the show.

33:53.485 --> 33:56.680
No, they brought this genius
in here to blow it up.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.121
- Yup.
- Mm-hm.

33:58.121 --> 34:00.757
- "Drink your Ensure"?

34:00.757 --> 34:02.885
Bitch, I can run rings around you.

34:02.885 --> 34:03.862
We all can.

34:03.862 --> 34:06.969
- She's right.
(performers snapping)

34:06.969 --> 34:08.136
You know what?

34:08.973 --> 34:10.139
Come on, Iris.

34:11.030 --> 34:12.560
- No, Bianca--
- No, no, this girl's

34:12.560 --> 34:17.560
got a real family going on,
I'm gonna go be a part of that,

34:17.726 --> 34:20.148
'cause this one here is dead.

34:20.148 --> 34:21.581
- Come on now, it's cool.
- You'll see.

34:21.581 --> 34:22.882
- Come on, Bianca.

34:22.882 --> 34:23.966
- You'll see.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.730
- Okay.

34:31.730 --> 34:32.630
Anyone else?

34:32.630 --> 34:33.516
- You've said enough.

34:33.516 --> 34:34.821
- Hey, if the wheels are gonna come off,

34:34.821 --> 34:36.036
I'd rather it be now.
- Oh, you want something

34:36.036 --> 34:37.545
to come off, buddy?
- Hey, okay, all right,

34:37.545 --> 34:39.018
everybody calm down.

34:39.018 --> 34:40.649
Bianca will change her mind.

34:40.649 --> 34:41.606
- Change her mind?

34:41.606 --> 34:43.790
When has she ever done that?

34:43.790 --> 34:45.706
- Okay, we're on break.

34:47.248 --> 34:48.081
Fuck.

34:52.483 --> 34:53.893
- [Runa] Jane.

34:53.893 --> 34:55.170
- Hey.
- He kicked me out.

34:55.170 --> 34:56.072
- I'll get you back in tomorrow.

34:56.072 --> 34:57.045
Tell him you're my assistant.

34:57.045 --> 34:57.878
- Well, what about tonight?

34:57.878 --> 34:58.961
The interview?

34:58.961 --> 35:00.188
- Tomorrow night, I promise.

35:00.188 --> 35:01.737
- Well, I can't, I've got a flight.

35:01.737 --> 35:04.820
- Can we just do this over the phone.

35:06.583 --> 35:07.940
(Runa sighs)
(door thuds)

35:07.940 --> 35:09.023
You gotta get down here.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.427
Iris and Bianca just quit.

35:10.427 --> 35:12.301
This guy is toxic.

35:12.301 --> 35:13.855
- [Richard] Look, I don't
know what to tell you.

35:13.855 --> 35:15.840
Artists need to try new
things to stay relevant,

35:15.840 --> 35:17.677
and this guy is the new thing.

35:17.677 --> 35:18.510
- Richard.

35:18.510 --> 35:21.110
- [Richard] I'm sorry, but
everyone is expendable.

35:21.110 --> 35:22.193
- Expendable?

35:38.362 --> 35:41.445
(footsteps treading)

35:45.884 --> 35:48.301
(tone rings)

35:49.627 --> 35:50.777
- [Kelly] Hello?

35:50.777 --> 35:51.707
- Hi.

35:51.707 --> 35:52.601
Is this Kelly?

35:52.601 --> 35:54.016
- [Kelly] Yeah, this is Kelly.

35:54.016 --> 35:55.717
- Hey, Kelly, it's Jane.

35:55.717 --> 35:57.177
I was calling Aurora.

35:57.177 --> 35:59.740
- [Kelly] Oh, I'm sorry,
she's not available.

35:59.740 --> 36:00.698
- [Jane] Hey, I'm just curious,

36:00.698 --> 36:02.732
this is her private line, isn't it?

36:02.732 --> 36:05.882
- [Kelly] It is, but
Richard changed her number,

36:05.882 --> 36:07.495
he just wants her in the bubble.

36:07.495 --> 36:10.775
He's got her on lockdown, no
distractions until we open.

36:10.775 --> 36:11.981
- Could you give me that number?

36:11.981 --> 36:13.507
It's really important.

36:13.507 --> 36:16.204
- [Kelly] I would, but you
can only get it from Richard.

36:16.204 --> 36:17.319
I'm sorry.

36:17.319 --> 36:18.291
- Okay.

36:18.291 --> 36:19.219
Thanks.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.886
- [Kelly] Take care.

36:23.033 --> 36:26.105
- I was 43 when I stopped
trying to have a baby.

36:26.105 --> 36:28.638
A doctor told me I was too old.

36:28.638 --> 36:31.071
Now Iris is having one at 43.

36:31.071 --> 36:32.998
- I have two now.

36:32.998 --> 36:33.898
Somewhere.

36:33.898 --> 36:36.006
- I have a career.

36:36.006 --> 36:38.592
I'm not gonna let that twerp burn it down.

36:38.592 --> 36:41.257
- The oldest aerialist in rock and roll.

36:41.257 --> 36:43.276
You do know how dumb that sounds, right?

36:43.276 --> 36:44.354
- It's what I got.

36:44.354 --> 36:46.573
- I mean, that's not even a category.

36:46.573 --> 36:48.021
- Anyway, I can't quit.

36:48.021 --> 36:49.502
I leased my place in Vegas.

36:49.502 --> 36:51.752
(knocking)

36:52.797 --> 36:54.289
- Let me go ahead and
state the obvious here:

36:54.289 --> 36:56.394
You're in a house you own.

36:56.394 --> 36:58.184
Maybe it's time you got off the road.

36:58.184 --> 36:59.017
- And do what?

36:59.017 --> 37:00.184
Give massages?

37:01.598 --> 37:02.832
- Hey.

37:02.832 --> 37:03.665
- Hey.

37:06.957 --> 37:08.940
- I was in the hood

37:08.940 --> 37:11.423
and wanted to talk to
you about what happened.

37:11.423 --> 37:13.126
But I see you're busy, so.

37:13.126 --> 37:14.682
- Hey.

37:14.682 --> 37:16.432
- Catch you tomorrow.

37:20.554 --> 37:22.637
- Thank you, for the cake

37:23.685 --> 37:25.018
and remembering.

37:29.032 --> 37:31.430
- That reporter was asking a
bunch of questions about you.

37:31.430 --> 37:32.915
Seemed kinda personal.

37:32.915 --> 37:37.082
I hope you don't mind I
just told her to fuck off.

37:49.990 --> 37:54.494
- [Paloma] I want one of
these everywhere I go today.

37:54.494 --> 37:56.205
- Did I miss a party?

37:56.205 --> 37:57.853
- Nope!

37:57.853 --> 38:00.386
Just fulfilling my destiny.

38:00.386 --> 38:03.662
Someone's gotta bring up the rear.

38:03.662 --> 38:05.816
(Paloma yawns)

38:05.816 --> 38:09.504
(Paloma vocalizing)

38:09.504 --> 38:10.739
- Mm, nice voice.

38:10.739 --> 38:12.339
(Paloma chuckles)

38:12.339 --> 38:14.372
- Compared to who?

38:14.372 --> 38:17.320
I need to find some other
way to impress Mother.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.625
- I read some interviews
where she had nothing

38:19.625 --> 38:22.038
but nice things to say about you.

38:22.038 --> 38:26.871
- Can you interview me so I
can get a message back to her?

38:30.295 --> 38:32.022
- What do you think of Jane?

38:32.022 --> 38:33.302
- I think I like her better

38:33.302 --> 38:36.135
when she's not playing second mom.

38:37.852 --> 38:39.127
Oh, god.

38:39.127 --> 38:41.201
So comfortable.

38:41.201 --> 38:44.487
(footsteps pattering)

38:44.487 --> 38:46.553
- Hey, are you guys dancers on this show?

38:46.553 --> 38:48.333
(Paloma laughs)

38:48.333 --> 38:49.953
- [Paloma] Thank you.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.703
That is better than being carded.

38:53.610 --> 38:55.512
Come on, dancer's are this way.

38:55.512 --> 38:56.345
Let's go.

39:13.519 --> 39:14.769
- Good Morning.

39:15.776 --> 39:17.935
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

39:17.935 --> 39:21.222
Had to do that for legal reasons.

39:21.222 --> 39:24.044
But I guess, if you're
gonna do a story about Jane,

39:24.044 --> 39:26.257
falling's gonna be part of it.

39:26.257 --> 39:29.167
You have free reign today.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.000
- Thank you.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.711
- On one condition, though:

39:32.711 --> 39:34.396
If you solve the mystery

39:34.396 --> 39:37.479
that is Jane Hawkins, please tell me.

39:39.234 --> 39:41.268
Over drinks sometime.

39:41.268 --> 39:42.101
- Sure.

39:45.006 --> 39:46.412
(knocking)

39:46.412 --> 39:48.081
- Hey, I'm Beth.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.758
- [Taylor] Taylor.

39:49.758 --> 39:51.591
- That's Mom, I'm Dad.

40:21.860 --> 40:24.055
- Okay, so I know that the
choreography has been the same

40:24.055 --> 40:28.363
for the last few tours,
but let's give it a twist.

40:28.363 --> 40:30.931
Jane, Hathaway, in the
back, men in the middle,

40:30.931 --> 40:33.014
Taylor and Beth up front.

40:33.933 --> 40:37.532
I've been loving this
whole expressionistic flow.

40:37.532 --> 40:40.115
It's like a greasy robot thing.

41:02.902 --> 41:03.889
Zee, can I--

41:03.889 --> 41:05.412
- Is there a problem?

41:05.412 --> 41:06.662
- No, I'm good.

41:09.399 --> 41:10.806
These girls are beautiful dancers,

41:10.806 --> 41:12.836
but I need to see if they can fly.

41:12.836 --> 41:14.284
- So you want the room.

41:14.284 --> 41:15.638
- Yeah, and another thing--

41:15.638 --> 41:18.242
- Always another thing.

41:18.242 --> 41:20.152
- Have you thought about what these babies

41:20.152 --> 41:22.674
are gonna look like next to Aurora?

41:22.674 --> 41:24.665
- It's the whole point.

41:24.665 --> 41:27.832
This is not the Dinosaur Tour anymore.

41:30.184 --> 41:33.011
(Taylor grunting)

41:33.011 --> 41:34.034
- What is the point of this?

41:34.034 --> 41:35.857
- To see how strong you are.

41:35.857 --> 41:37.190
Beth, you're up.

41:40.387 --> 41:41.674
- I have great form.

41:41.674 --> 41:44.338
- What's the first thing
to go when you're weak?

41:44.338 --> 41:45.296
- You're gonna say form.

41:45.296 --> 41:46.129
- Mm.

41:50.805 --> 41:51.638
Great.

41:52.487 --> 41:55.070
- All right, show me your form.

42:08.904 --> 42:10.011
(Taylor sighs)

42:10.011 --> 42:10.844
Take your time.

42:10.844 --> 42:11.802
Safety first, okay?

42:11.802 --> 42:12.635
- I know.

42:12.635 --> 42:13.468
I know.

42:25.437 --> 42:26.604
- Jane, honey?

42:28.669 --> 42:30.352
Look what I found.

42:30.352 --> 42:32.372
- You're an archeologist, T-Buddy.

42:32.372 --> 42:36.705
- Yeah, well, let's just
show him what you got, huh?

42:38.371 --> 42:43.371
(lift whirring)
(lift beeping)

42:46.599 --> 42:47.432
- Hey.

42:51.652 --> 42:52.876
(lift clunks)

42:52.876 --> 42:54.121
Hey.

42:54.121 --> 42:55.451
How they doing?

42:55.451 --> 42:56.409
- Beth is strong.

42:56.409 --> 42:58.236
Taylor not so much.

42:58.236 --> 43:00.339
- Stick her in a circle thing.

43:00.339 --> 43:01.512
- A lyra?

43:01.512 --> 43:04.073
I'm not putting anyone in
the air who isn't safe.

43:04.073 --> 43:06.183
- Look, putting dancers in the air

43:06.183 --> 43:09.772
is supposed to be your thing, so do that.

43:09.772 --> 43:10.605
Please.

43:12.923 --> 43:13.756
Thank you.

43:19.482 --> 43:22.065

44:35.877 --> 44:36.865

44:36.865 --> 44:38.099
- [Xavier] That's not already in the show?

44:38.099 --> 44:39.102
- No, it got cut.

44:39.102 --> 44:40.241
Nobody's ever seen it.

44:40.241 --> 44:41.561
It's good, huh?

44:41.561 --> 44:43.527
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

44:43.527 --> 44:44.842
Let's put the new girls in it.

44:44.842 --> 44:46.063
- What?

44:46.063 --> 44:47.945
- You said yourself, Taylor's
a little physically weak,

44:47.945 --> 44:49.577
so this will be perfect for her.

44:49.577 --> 44:50.660
- No, no, no.

44:52.461 --> 44:56.179
- Does everything have to be a battle?

44:56.179 --> 44:57.246
- Okay.

44:57.246 --> 44:58.205
- What the fuck?

44:58.205 --> 44:59.417
- No, it's good.
- This is our thing.

44:59.417 --> 45:01.592
No, no, fuck that, no.

45:01.592 --> 45:03.445
- Hathaway, I...

45:03.445 --> 45:04.278
Jamal.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.979
(door clacks)

45:11.979 --> 45:13.121
(door thuds)

45:13.121 --> 45:15.704
(Xavier sighs)

45:17.414 --> 45:18.497
Beth, Taylor.

45:19.371 --> 45:22.844
Now.
(snaps fingers)

45:22.844 --> 45:23.677
Climb up.

45:25.479 --> 45:26.365
Climb up.

45:26.365 --> 45:27.468
Go ahead.

45:27.468 --> 45:28.301
Go up.

45:33.037 --> 45:33.870
All right.

45:33.870 --> 45:35.256
- Twinkles.

45:35.256 --> 45:36.339
Darling.
- Mm.

45:37.212 --> 45:38.275
- Do me a favor?

45:38.275 --> 45:39.192
Grab a mop.

45:40.306 --> 45:42.588
- Oh, I'm not cleaning that up.

45:42.588 --> 45:43.838
No.
- Thank you.

45:52.578 --> 45:55.078
- I don't need money this bad.

45:57.216 --> 45:59.583
We can't let this happen.

45:59.583 --> 46:01.349
- Yeah, you're gonna go
up, you're gonna go down

46:01.349 --> 46:02.802
and down there.
- No, yeah, I don't really,

46:02.802 --> 46:03.719
no, just...

46:04.608 --> 46:06.791
No, I don't think we need,
just send me somebody--

46:06.791 --> 46:08.431
- A word with you, Satan?

46:08.431 --> 46:10.761
- Yeah, I'll just call you.

46:10.761 --> 46:13.369
- The fans know us as The Family

46:13.369 --> 46:16.243
and we have been performing
for them for nearly 20 years,

46:16.243 --> 46:18.724
and you come in here and
treat us like we're nothing?

46:18.724 --> 46:19.807
- Okay, okay, hold on.
- That is not okay.

46:19.807 --> 46:21.875
- Hold on a second.
- No, he needs to hear this.

46:21.875 --> 46:23.746
It's either us or him.

46:23.746 --> 46:24.579
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:24.579 --> 46:25.454
- Yeah, really.

46:25.454 --> 46:26.412
- Bubba, okay, calm down.

46:26.412 --> 46:27.409
Could you give us some space?

46:27.409 --> 46:28.774
- No, I kinda want to hear this.

46:28.774 --> 46:29.984
- [Jane] Would you please come with me?

46:29.984 --> 46:30.817
Come on.

46:33.299 --> 46:37.277
- The fans would've loved to
see Iris, just getting bigger,

46:37.277 --> 46:39.076
and we could have had a dancer replace her

46:39.076 --> 46:40.641
when the time comes.
- No, listen, listen--

46:40.641 --> 46:42.540
- Bianca, all she needed was for us

46:42.540 --> 46:44.382
to say that The Fam is still The Fam.

46:44.382 --> 46:45.811
- Bianca made her own choice.

46:45.811 --> 46:47.359
- Okay, well, then let's make ours.

46:47.359 --> 46:48.793
It's either us or him.

46:48.793 --> 46:50.185
- We're going to Richard.
- Richard doesn't care.

46:50.185 --> 46:51.613
That's what I'm trying to tell you--

46:51.613 --> 46:52.597
- Then we go to the diva.

46:52.597 --> 46:54.430
- No, I don't know that she cares.

46:54.430 --> 46:56.260
Richard told me that all
of us are expendable,

46:56.260 --> 46:57.241
every single one of us.

46:57.241 --> 46:58.638
- What?
- Yes, exactly.

46:58.638 --> 47:00.842
And that means he is too.

47:00.842 --> 47:04.433
If we say we're all outta here,
then Richard will fire him

47:04.433 --> 47:05.782
in a heartbeat.
- He won't.

47:05.782 --> 47:06.865
He--
- Come on, yes, he will.

47:06.865 --> 47:07.698
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

47:07.698 --> 47:09.041
- No, no, no, no.

47:09.041 --> 47:11.152
I can't. I can't.

47:11.152 --> 47:12.456
- Okay, Jane, come on.

47:12.456 --> 47:13.743
We fight together.

47:13.743 --> 47:15.056
I know you're scared, it's all right.

47:15.056 --> 47:17.323
- It's too risky, I can't.

47:17.323 --> 47:20.656
- Dammit, this doesn't work without you.

47:29.469 --> 47:32.019
You'd really just let me go?

47:35.177 --> 47:36.010
- Please.

47:41.550 --> 47:44.300
- You have to destroy everything?

47:45.545 --> 47:46.577
- Jane.
- Please,

47:46.577 --> 47:47.679
it's not that simple.
- Jane.

47:47.679 --> 47:48.762
- It's not.

47:48.762 --> 47:50.712
- It really is.

47:50.712 --> 47:51.545
Watch.

47:54.086 --> 47:55.165
You suck.

47:55.165 --> 47:56.544
I quit.

47:56.544 --> 47:57.544
See? Simple.

47:58.478 --> 48:01.145
(Taylor laughs)

48:04.648 --> 48:06.565
- Is that it for today?

48:17.782 --> 48:20.449
(ominous music)

48:33.533 --> 48:34.616
- Hold tight.

48:37.577 --> 48:40.327
(both screaming)

48:44.968 --> 48:45.801
- Janie.

48:47.763 --> 48:49.252
- [Taylor] I wanna get down.

48:49.252 --> 48:52.085
(both whimpering)

48:59.586 --> 49:00.586
- Come down.

49:01.829 --> 49:02.662
Come down.

49:04.289 --> 49:05.538
All right, come down easy.

49:05.538 --> 49:06.554
Come down easy.

49:06.554 --> 49:07.387
All right, you're okay.

49:07.387 --> 49:08.918
(Taylor gagging)

49:08.918 --> 49:11.585
(Taylor coughs)

49:12.551 --> 49:13.549
- Okay.

49:13.549 --> 49:14.634
That's it, I'm done.

49:14.634 --> 49:15.573
- [Jane] Don't go. Please.

49:15.573 --> 49:16.740
- I'm already gone.

49:16.740 --> 49:17.793
- [Jane] Please, come on.

49:17.793 --> 49:19.712
- You know, I was counting
on the money for this.

49:19.712 --> 49:21.230
I already leased my apartment for this,

49:21.230 --> 49:23.720
but, Jane, I'm not gonna do this!

49:23.720 --> 49:27.825
And I can't believe I let them
go and I didn't follow them.

49:27.825 --> 49:29.096
But you know what?

49:29.096 --> 49:32.013
It's because I always followed you!

49:36.836 --> 49:38.931
(door clacks)

49:38.931 --> 49:41.348
(door thuds)

50:11.417 --> 50:14.302
(Jane sighs)

50:14.302 --> 50:15.135
(gate clacks)

50:15.135 --> 50:18.333
(gate creaking)

50:18.333 --> 50:20.887
(gate thuds)

50:20.887 --> 50:22.937
- Sure you still want to do this?

50:22.937 --> 50:23.770
- Yes.

50:26.199 --> 50:28.105
- I felt I had to lie
about my age at first,

50:28.105 --> 50:31.637
but then I really learned
that you can't tell

50:31.637 --> 50:33.576
how old someone is on stage,

50:33.576 --> 50:34.786
especially when they're in the air,

50:34.786 --> 50:38.411
so I booked work in Vegas pretty quick.

50:38.411 --> 50:41.285
- And you reconnected with Serena.

50:41.285 --> 50:44.091
I saw some video of you two rehearsing.

50:44.091 --> 50:45.603
- Yeah.

50:45.603 --> 50:47.894
- You made the gymnastics
team for the 1980 Olympics.

50:47.894 --> 50:50.400
- And then Russia invaded Afghanistan.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.710
- Ah, the boycott.

50:51.710 --> 50:55.603
And you tried again in '84,
but ruptured your Achilles.

50:55.603 --> 50:58.882
- Yeah, that's what I was known for.

50:58.882 --> 51:00.582
- But what happened after that?

51:00.582 --> 51:02.749
You dropped off the radar.

51:04.954 --> 51:07.954
- Couple years of suicidal thoughts.

51:12.528 --> 51:13.898
- Can I show you something?

51:13.898 --> 51:16.481
(gentle music)

51:31.624 --> 51:33.414
- Where did you get this?

51:33.414 --> 51:36.940
- [Runa] At the gymnastic
camp where you taught.

51:36.940 --> 51:39.139
- This was how I bounced back.

51:39.139 --> 51:41.115
- You started performing.

51:41.115 --> 51:42.115
- [Jane] Mm.

51:43.421 --> 51:46.450
- I found one reference of you
training for the '88 Olympics

51:46.450 --> 51:48.988
with a coach named Sergei Kilinski.

51:48.988 --> 51:50.767
Is that true?

51:50.767 --> 51:51.600
- Yes.

51:52.759 --> 51:55.789
- [Runa] So you were trying
for your third Olympics.

51:55.789 --> 51:57.791
- It's all I knew how to do.

51:57.791 --> 52:00.503
I was too old, probably.

52:00.503 --> 52:02.667
I didn't realize how much
the sport was changing,

52:02.667 --> 52:05.334
it was getting tougher, younger.

52:08.699 --> 52:10.334
The young girls can do these crazy tricks.

52:10.334 --> 52:11.693
Their center of gravity is higher.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.776
They don't have any hips.

52:16.179 --> 52:17.979
(Jane sighs)

52:17.979 --> 52:21.146
I'm sorry, it's my own private summer.

52:22.400 --> 52:23.567
- Sergei was expensive.

52:23.567 --> 52:25.506
How did you afford him?

52:25.506 --> 52:28.663
- I had a sponsorship with IGC.

52:28.663 --> 52:29.601
- A sponsorship?

52:29.601 --> 52:32.625
- Well, I didn't have
him that long, anyway.

52:32.625 --> 52:34.460
When I didn't make it to
the trials, I walked away.

52:34.460 --> 52:35.627
I got married.

52:37.090 --> 52:39.257
- I'm sorry about your ex.

52:40.354 --> 52:43.850
- David would sit right
where you're sitting.

52:43.850 --> 52:46.611
- Did you ever want to have kids?

52:46.611 --> 52:50.444
- Let's not make the
article about that stuff.

52:51.362 --> 52:52.915
- You called the dancers your family.

52:52.915 --> 52:54.129
- [Jane] They are.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.370
- Family is important to you.

52:55.370 --> 52:57.361
- [Jane] Sure.

52:57.361 --> 53:00.238
- Then why didn't you fight for them?

53:00.238 --> 53:01.708
- Excuse me?

53:01.708 --> 53:03.389
- Seems like you could have today.

53:03.389 --> 53:04.232
- You know what?

53:04.232 --> 53:06.497
I think it's time for sleep.

53:06.497 --> 53:09.350
- Okay, I'm sorry, I'm just
trying to get inside your head

53:09.350 --> 53:11.428
so I can paint the right picture.

53:11.428 --> 53:12.891
You're clearly very driven.

53:12.891 --> 53:14.941
Your life reflects that.

53:14.941 --> 53:17.932
You seem to choose career
over relationships, though,

53:17.932 --> 53:20.137
which I'm not judging, I'm
just trying to figure out

53:20.137 --> 53:21.336
whether you're naturally a loner

53:21.336 --> 53:22.711
or whether you wanted family

53:22.711 --> 53:25.055
and it didn't work--
- I want to go to sleep.

53:25.055 --> 53:26.167
(Runa sighs)

53:26.167 --> 53:27.000
- Okay.

53:29.766 --> 53:31.742
You do realize that I'm
trying to write an article

53:31.742 --> 53:35.328
about you, the person, not
just the stuff you've done.

53:35.328 --> 53:36.481
I need more from you than stuff

53:36.481 --> 53:39.538
I could get off the internet, so please,

53:39.538 --> 53:44.513
I'm sorry to get intense here,
but I've come a long way.

53:44.513 --> 53:46.430
Let me in a little bit.

53:48.428 --> 53:53.178
- I'm sorry if you're the
latest person I let down today.

53:58.645 --> 54:00.812
- Thank you for your time.

54:02.505 --> 54:05.531
- What kind of story are you writing?

54:05.531 --> 54:07.759
- I was hoping a good one.

54:07.759 --> 54:10.569
- Might be too late for that.

54:45.839 --> 54:48.284
You already know the choreography.

54:48.284 --> 54:50.089
Actually, I'm kinda changing it.

56:40.315 --> 56:43.232
Thank you for going to the trouble.

56:49.156 --> 56:51.739
(gentle music)

57:07.954 --> 57:11.535
- I saw you once, in
Vegas, when I was a kid

57:11.535 --> 57:15.546
and I told my mom, "That's
what I want to do,"

57:15.546 --> 57:17.013
but she wasn't having it,

57:17.013 --> 57:20.276
not after she saw your friend fall.

57:20.276 --> 57:21.524
- Ah.

57:21.524 --> 57:23.478
- So I'm kinda getting a late start.

57:23.478 --> 57:27.615
- I was 42 when I started,
so you're not late.

57:27.615 --> 57:28.448
Jump up.

57:31.032 --> 57:32.705
- [Dr. Herrera] So what
have you done to yourself?

57:32.705 --> 57:33.779
- I don't know.

57:33.779 --> 57:35.911
I stopped going to see doctors.

57:35.911 --> 57:37.989
- You do know that I'm a doctor, yes?

57:37.989 --> 57:39.201
Resist.

57:39.201 --> 57:42.035
- Well, I know that you helped Serena, so.

57:42.035 --> 57:43.535
- Mm-hm. This way.

57:45.262 --> 57:46.345
This way.

57:46.345 --> 57:48.487
Yes, I did help Serena.

57:48.487 --> 57:50.476
Lay on your stomach.

57:50.476 --> 57:52.309
That was hard for her.

57:53.476 --> 57:55.105
She had to stop.

57:55.105 --> 57:57.107
I wouldn't tell you to stop.

57:57.107 --> 57:59.646
Plus, athletes never listen anyway.

57:59.646 --> 58:03.021
They push through, until they break.

58:03.021 --> 58:05.649
(Jane grunts)

58:05.649 --> 58:08.848
I don't think it's age with
you, I think it's injury.

58:08.848 --> 58:10.906
Age is an injury

58:12.053 --> 58:12.906
- Oh, so this is it?

58:12.906 --> 58:14.151
- [Jane] Yeah.

58:14.151 --> 58:15.721
- [Dr. Herrera] Any other big falls?

58:15.721 --> 58:18.997
- I was attempting an Omelianchik on beam.

58:18.997 --> 58:20.845
- Well, what would possess you to do that?

58:20.845 --> 58:22.305
- I was young and stupid.

58:22.305 --> 58:23.403
- [Dr. Herrera] Can you turn over for me?

58:23.403 --> 58:25.145
(Jane chuckles)

58:25.145 --> 58:28.323
That is not a move somebody
does in their spare time.

58:28.323 --> 58:30.500
- I was training for '88.

58:30.500 --> 58:33.080
- Oh, you were trying
to get back in there.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.330
Mm-hm.

58:36.400 --> 58:39.892
Oh, you fell, you landed right here.

58:39.892 --> 58:41.153
- [Jane] Yes.

58:41.153 --> 58:43.079
- I thought so.

58:43.079 --> 58:44.662
- How can you tell?

58:47.254 --> 58:49.236
- The body remembers.

58:49.236 --> 58:51.819
(gentle music)

58:58.510 --> 59:00.927
(Jane sighs)

59:03.982 --> 59:06.399
(body thuds)

01:00:47.179 --> 01:00:49.679
(tense music)

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.867
(lamp clatters)

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:17.309
- [Dan] Hey.

01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:18.642
What's going on?

01:02:20.548 --> 01:02:21.381
You okay?

01:02:22.965 --> 01:02:24.332
- [Jane] I've done everything wrong.

01:02:24.332 --> 01:02:25.904
I made the wrong choices.

01:02:25.904 --> 01:02:27.081
- [Dan] Hey now.

01:02:27.081 --> 01:02:29.364
- I did it to myself.

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:33.218
The body remembers, and
it never forgave me.

01:02:33.218 --> 01:02:35.013
- Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:02:35.013 --> 01:02:36.704
- I don't have anybody.

01:02:36.704 --> 01:02:38.582
I'm alone.

01:02:38.582 --> 01:02:40.665
- Hey, I count, a little.

01:02:41.816 --> 01:02:43.541
And you've got your dancing family.

01:02:43.541 --> 01:02:45.894
- No, I let them down.

01:02:45.894 --> 01:02:47.603
I let everybody down.

01:02:47.603 --> 01:02:49.632
- Everyone lets everyone down,

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:50.808
says or does something stupid.

01:02:50.808 --> 01:02:52.414
That's what families do.

01:02:52.414 --> 01:02:53.747
- It's too late.

01:02:55.461 --> 01:02:56.643
- Maybe not.

01:02:56.643 --> 01:02:59.117
I mean, if it really was a family,

01:02:59.117 --> 01:03:01.074
there's gotta be some forgiveness there,

01:03:01.074 --> 01:03:02.577
if it's worth anything.

01:03:02.577 --> 01:03:04.936
Like, I'm forgiving you right now

01:03:04.936 --> 01:03:06.512
for getting snot on my favorite shirt.

01:03:06.512 --> 01:03:08.844
(Jane laughs)

01:03:08.844 --> 01:03:10.455
Hey, hey.

01:03:10.455 --> 01:03:11.288
Really.

01:03:13.185 --> 01:03:17.447
The family you choose,
you can choose again.

01:03:17.447 --> 01:03:20.672
(introspective music)

01:03:50.133 --> 01:03:51.401
- [Jane] Hey, Hollis.

01:03:51.401 --> 01:03:53.379
- Hey, hummingbird.

01:03:53.379 --> 01:03:54.871
- I just need a minute with her.

01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:56.636
- Can't, she's in the bubble right now.

01:03:56.636 --> 01:03:58.303
- [Jane] Have you heard about The Fam?

01:03:58.303 --> 01:03:59.527
- [Hollis] No.

01:03:59.527 --> 01:04:02.894
- All gone, everyone, except me.

01:04:02.894 --> 01:04:04.394
- Fucking Richard?

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:08.206
You know what?

01:04:08.206 --> 01:04:11.312
He can try to get rid of me too.

01:04:11.312 --> 01:04:12.312
- Thank you.

- The show we're working
on isn't her show anymore,

01:04:36.523 --> 01:04:38.674
and I think she should know it.

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:39.524
- She does know.

01:04:39.524 --> 01:04:40.482

01:04:40.482 --> 01:04:43.263

buy out our contracts,

01:04:58.084 --> 01:04:59.751

Aurora is here on Friday!

01:05:40.152 --> 01:05:41.975
- Woo, woo!
(performers applauding)

01:05:41.975 --> 01:05:44.514
- So start getting it in your
brains that, when she's here,

01:05:44.514 --> 01:05:46.010
you don't make eye contact with her.

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:47.140

- [Jane] Yeah?

01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:56.293
- I want to be really clear on this,

01:05:56.293 --> 01:05:59.601
so I'm gonna make eye contact
with you: I'm the director.

01:05:59.601 --> 01:06:00.652
You got a problem, you come to me,

01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:04.111
you don't go over my head, ever.

01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:05.841
- Well, I'm the aerial choreographer,

01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:09.424
so I'm kind of over
your head all the time.

01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:14.671
- I'm cutting your solo.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:17.254
(tense music)

01:06:44.851 --> 01:06:46.679

Insurance will cover it.

01:06:55.576 --> 01:06:56.847
Our girl deserves better.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:57.722
- She does.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.139
- [T-Bone] Mm-hm.

01:07:00.346 --> 01:07:02.390
- Do you still have
the keys to this place?

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:03.887
- [T-Bone] Mm-hm.

01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:07.554
- [Jane] Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:07:08.616 --> 01:07:12.058
- I'm thinking, "How is
it we're the same age?"

01:08:17.153 --> 01:08:17.986
Come on.

01:08:19.837 --> 01:08:23.265
- Now the road's gonna go on with out us,

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.599
be like we were never there.

01:08:26.697 --> 01:08:30.279
I wonder if Aurora is
even going to notice.

01:08:31.397 --> 01:08:34.979
So, who was that guy
with the greasy hands?

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:37.854
Don't tell me he was a masseuse.

01:08:37.854 --> 01:08:39.143
I'm not buying it.

01:08:39.143 --> 01:08:40.310
- My neighbor.

01:08:42.241 --> 01:08:43.073
No.

01:08:44.682 --> 01:08:47.243
If I've been running cold lately,

01:08:47.243 --> 01:08:51.076
it's because I am so
very, very goddamned hot.

01:08:52.113 --> 01:08:55.031

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:34.480
♪ You'll hear me in your stereo ♪

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.494
- Paloma.

01:12:35.494 --> 01:12:36.635
It's distracting.

01:12:36.635 --> 01:12:37.468
Lip-sync.

01:12:40.679 --> 01:12:44.096
Hey, I want the circle things, the lyras,

01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:47.744
to spin in the opposite
direction when the chorus hits.

01:12:47.744 --> 01:12:48.577
- No.

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:51.641
- No?

01:12:51.641 --> 01:12:52.735
- No, it's not possible.

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.318
I mean, physically.

01:12:55.953 --> 01:12:57.856
- Were you under the
impression those are motorized,

01:12:57.856 --> 01:13:00.129
because they're on swivels.

01:13:00.129 --> 01:13:03.821
It's momentum that's making
these young'uns spin around.

01:13:03.821 --> 01:13:07.640
It's nothing else but mass times velocity.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.106
Can't just change the laws of physics

01:13:10.106 --> 01:13:12.848
when the chorus hits, kid.

01:13:12.848 --> 01:13:14.934
I actually had to Google Dunning-Kruger.

01:13:14.934 --> 01:13:16.110
- You know what?

01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:17.638
You're fired.

01:13:17.638 --> 01:13:18.888
Pack your shit!

01:13:19.881 --> 01:13:22.055
- [Jane] All right, that's
it, everyone take 30.

01:13:22.055 --> 01:13:23.199
(T-Bone chuckles)

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:24.032
- 30?

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:27.125
(T-Bone laughs)
Jane!

01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:28.542
- Oh, god.
- Jane!

01:13:29.745 --> 01:13:31.505
You're not running this show.

01:13:31.505 --> 01:13:33.040
- I can make a safety call anytime.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.071
Check my contract.

01:13:34.071 --> 01:13:34.946
- [Xavier] Yeah, well, it's in my contract

01:13:34.946 --> 01:13:35.779
that I'm the director,

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:37.502
which means I get some goddamn respect!

01:13:37.502 --> 01:13:38.943
- [Jane] You think that?!

01:13:38.943 --> 01:13:40.091
- Yes!

01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:43.369
For fuck's sake, what is your problem?

01:13:43.369 --> 01:13:44.954
You're supposed to be a team player.

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:46.554
Richard said, "Don't worry about Jane."

01:13:46.554 --> 01:13:47.387
- He did?

01:13:47.387 --> 01:13:49.819
- Yeah, but all I have is
Jane all up in my face,

01:13:49.819 --> 01:13:51.721
contradicting me in front of everybody,

01:13:51.721 --> 01:13:52.652
shitting on my ideas,

01:13:52.652 --> 01:13:54.154
and shutting down my fucking rehearsals.

01:13:54.154 --> 01:13:56.487
- I'm actually trying to help you.

01:13:56.487 --> 01:14:00.398
- Oh, because you think that
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:14:00.398 --> 01:14:02.561
I've choreographed quite
a few tours before.

01:14:02.561 --> 01:14:03.686
- Not with this many elements.

01:14:03.686 --> 01:14:04.519
Not with aerials.

01:14:04.519 --> 01:14:06.748
- Yeah, but I have the vision.

01:14:06.748 --> 01:14:08.150
That's why I got the gig.

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:09.420
That's why I get respect.

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.253
Got it?

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:15.235
- Okay, just listen to people

01:14:15.235 --> 01:14:17.043
with more experience than you, okay?

01:14:17.043 --> 01:14:18.455
Just do that.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:19.599
- Oh, just try that.
- Mm-hm.

01:14:19.599 --> 01:14:22.099
- Learn from the ancient ones.

01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:28.260
You know what your problem is?

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.760
You want this gig.

01:14:30.893 --> 01:14:31.893
Get over it.

01:14:33.718 --> 01:14:34.551
- Fire me.

01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:37.362
Go ahead. Fire me.

01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:39.646
You can't, you can't.

01:14:39.646 --> 01:14:41.721
You can't do what I do.

01:14:41.721 --> 01:14:43.325
You cut my solo, for what?

01:14:43.325 --> 01:14:45.176
To get back at me?

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:47.423
You just lost your costume change.

01:14:47.423 --> 01:14:50.454
- Okay, well--
- You can't fire T-Bone.

01:14:50.454 --> 01:14:52.692
He's the most important
person on this tour.

01:14:52.692 --> 01:14:55.433
They would fire you a hundred
times before they fired him,

01:14:55.433 --> 01:14:58.335
and the reason you don't know
that is because you're green.

01:14:58.335 --> 01:15:00.920
You don't know how a tour works,
you don't know how I work,

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.923
and you certainly don't know how close

01:15:02.923 --> 01:15:05.695
you just came to losing an arm.

01:15:05.695 --> 01:15:08.399
You grind me down without a clue

01:15:08.399 --> 01:15:11.995
that I am the best person
to have in your corner.

01:15:11.995 --> 01:15:13.672
And the worst part about it is,

01:15:13.672 --> 01:15:17.451
you have no fucking clue
that you're being used.

01:15:17.451 --> 01:15:20.754
(ominous music)

01:15:20.754 --> 01:15:22.032
(door clacks)

01:15:22.032 --> 01:15:24.449
(door thuds)

01:15:38.839 --> 01:15:39.922
- [Runa] Hey.

01:15:42.821 --> 01:15:43.904
- Still here?

01:15:46.935 --> 01:15:49.602
I'm sorry about the other night.

01:15:51.284 --> 01:15:52.421
Is that it?

01:15:52.421 --> 01:15:54.088
Is that the article?

01:15:55.367 --> 01:15:57.099
- Why did you lie to me?

01:15:58.008 --> 01:15:59.142
- I lied to you?

01:15:59.142 --> 01:16:00.830
- When you said you had a
sponsorship with the IGC.

01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:01.903
- I did have a sponsorship with the IGC.

01:16:01.903 --> 01:16:02.998
with the IGC.

01:16:02.998 --> 01:16:04.114
- No, I mean for '88.

01:16:04.114 --> 01:16:06.197
I checked and you didn't.

01:16:07.213 --> 01:16:09.713
- Maybe my memory's failing too.

01:16:09.713 --> 01:16:12.184
- Is that something I should write about?

01:16:12.184 --> 01:16:13.869
- What is your deal?

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:16.901
I agreed to a story about
my aerial career, that's it.

01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:19.250
But you're digging into my history,

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:22.236
asking everyone questions that
are none of your business.

01:16:22.236 --> 01:16:23.194
- It's a story about you, Jane.

01:16:23.194 --> 01:16:24.470
Of course I'm gonna ask questions.

01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:26.199
- But why stuck on the past?

01:16:26.199 --> 01:16:27.032
Why?

01:16:27.869 --> 01:16:29.318
- I wanted to know how you got here.

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:30.623
- [Jane] And why focus on my failure

01:16:30.623 --> 01:16:32.738
trying to get into the Olympics?

01:16:32.738 --> 01:16:34.061
- It's your gymnastics career.

01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:35.305
How is that off base to ask?

01:16:35.305 --> 01:16:38.192
- Because I don't want
my entire life exposed.

01:16:38.192 --> 01:16:41.225
- It's just background information.

01:16:41.225 --> 01:16:42.367
Fine.

01:16:42.367 --> 01:16:43.640
Totally off the record,

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.090
but how did a young woman
with no affiliation,

01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:47.777
sponsors, or financial support

01:16:47.777 --> 01:16:50.436
pay for a top coach like Sergei Kilinski?

01:16:54.983 --> 01:16:57.302
- Are you even a reporter?

01:16:57.302 --> 01:16:58.706
- What?
- You wanna know

01:16:58.706 --> 01:17:01.612
how much money I had, how
I could afford Sergei,

01:17:01.612 --> 01:17:03.120
you're looking for dirt
in my personal life.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.191
Are you working for Gayle?

01:17:05.191 --> 01:17:07.023
- Who?
- Gayle Bishop.

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:10.191
- I don't know--
- My ex-husband's widow.

01:17:10.191 --> 01:17:11.637
- I don't know her--
- I don't owe Gayle

01:17:11.637 --> 01:17:12.874
a damn thing.

01:17:12.874 --> 01:17:14.168
Tell her to back off.

01:17:14.168 --> 01:17:15.316
- Jane--
- And if she thinks

01:17:15.316 --> 01:17:17.975
that I have assets that she can have,

01:17:17.975 --> 01:17:19.944
she is out of her tiny mind.

01:17:19.944 --> 01:17:24.277
I never had any money,
especially after my Achilles.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.377
You wanna know how I paid for Sergei?

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.627
I sold my eggs.

01:17:30.549 --> 01:17:32.532
And it was the worst thing I ever did.

01:17:32.532 --> 01:17:34.512
So whatever it is you're up to,

01:17:34.512 --> 01:17:37.023
whatever's written there, just stop.

01:17:37.023 --> 01:17:38.523
This story's over.

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:08.532
(Runa sighs)

01:18:12.571 --> 01:18:15.214
- Told you she was in a bad mood.

01:18:15.214 --> 01:18:16.338
I can help you.

01:18:16.338 --> 01:18:18.293
Get you a scoop.

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:21.074
"An insider look at today's
most secretive pop star."

01:18:21.074 --> 01:18:23.657
Come on, no reporter gets that.

01:18:25.377 --> 01:18:28.512
I'll sneak you into tomorrow,
to Aurora's show and tell.

01:18:28.512 --> 01:18:30.641
You can at least get
something out of this.

01:18:30.641 --> 01:18:33.193
You definitely don't need Jane.

01:18:33.193 --> 01:18:34.193
- Thank you.

01:18:35.194 --> 01:18:37.116
- Did you learn anything?

01:18:37.116 --> 01:18:38.247
Is she dating somebody?

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:40.503
Is she a martial artist?

01:18:40.503 --> 01:18:43.509
Did she give you any hint
that she wants to retire?

01:18:43.509 --> 01:18:46.034
I would like to know that.

01:18:46.034 --> 01:18:47.928
- She's focused on her career.

01:18:47.928 --> 01:18:51.286
She doesn't have time for anything else.

01:18:51.286 --> 01:18:53.590
How long can that last?

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:55.507
- Because she's so old?

01:18:57.931 --> 01:18:59.785
- Because she's so injured.

01:18:59.785 --> 01:19:01.452
You haven't noticed?

01:19:02.877 --> 01:19:05.377
(door clacks)

01:19:09.172 --> 01:19:10.871
- Get some sleep, everybody.

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:12.671
Remember, tomorrow, eyes down.

01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:14.605
T-Bone, thank you so much
for your continued services.

01:19:14.605 --> 01:19:15.614
Mea culpa.

01:19:15.614 --> 01:19:16.447
Goodnight.

01:19:18.027 --> 01:19:18.860
Easy.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:20.381
You were right, I need to listen more.

01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:22.335
- Okay, well, let's just
make a good show, all right?

01:19:22.335 --> 01:19:24.017
- Yeah, and the thing you
said about the costume change,

01:19:24.017 --> 01:19:25.176
yeah, I screwed up.

01:19:25.176 --> 01:19:26.704
Okay, obviously, your
solo still has to go in.

01:19:26.704 --> 01:19:28.123
The only thing, I
haven't actually seen it,

01:19:28.123 --> 01:19:30.790
and right now, I really need to.

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:49.228
- [Jane] This is when
I'm over the audience.

01:19:49.228 --> 01:19:52.978
The dancer pulls in the
fabric and I offload.

01:19:55.517 --> 01:19:56.601
- [Xavier] We actually need to extend

01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:58.550
this moment just a bit.

01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:01.131
- No, no, it fits
perfectly with the music.

01:20:01.131 --> 01:20:03.207
- No, I added a headdress to her costume,

01:20:03.207 --> 01:20:05.791
so it's gonna take a little bit more time.

01:20:05.791 --> 01:20:07.359
Can you vamp on it, or something?

01:20:07.359 --> 01:20:09.039
(Jane sighs)

01:20:09.039 --> 01:20:09.974
Just vamp a bit.

01:20:09.974 --> 01:20:11.128
- Okay.
- Just extend it out.

01:20:11.128 --> 01:20:12.295
- [Jane] Okay.

01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:16.388
(Jane grunts)

01:20:16.388 --> 01:20:18.971
(gentle music)

01:20:38.153 --> 01:20:39.236
That enough?

01:20:39.236 --> 01:20:40.285
- We just need a little bit longer.

01:20:40.285 --> 01:20:41.202
Keep going.

01:20:43.647 --> 01:20:45.380
We'll make the music match, don't worry.

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:47.130
- [Jane] Okay.

01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:49.797
(Jane grunting)

01:20:58.055 --> 01:20:58.985
- Almost there.

01:20:58.985 --> 01:20:59.977
- [Jane] Okay.

01:20:59.977 --> 01:21:02.644
(Jane grunting)

01:21:11.401 --> 01:21:12.513
Good?

01:21:12.513 --> 01:21:14.867
- No, no, no, keep going.

01:21:14.867 --> 01:21:16.325
- [Jane] Okay.

01:21:16.325 --> 01:21:18.992
(Jane grunting)

01:21:21.783 --> 01:21:24.533
(dramatic music)

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.361
- [Xavier] Keep going.

01:21:31.361 --> 01:21:32.778
- [Jane] I can't.

01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:37.466
I gotta come down.

01:21:37.466 --> 01:21:40.133
(Jane grunting)

01:22:01.084 --> 01:22:03.501
(body thuds)

01:22:09.163 --> 01:22:12.413
- You really were a time bomb, Hawkins.

01:22:13.673 --> 01:22:17.590
Good thing that didn't
happen on the tour, huh?

01:22:23.395 --> 01:22:26.395
You want me to call 9-1-1?

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:28.213
- No.

01:22:31.507 --> 01:22:34.174
(Jane groaning)

01:22:51.215 --> 01:22:54.385
(car door thuds)

01:22:54.385 --> 01:22:56.281
(car door clacks)

01:22:56.281 --> 01:22:57.564
(Jane groans)

01:22:57.564 --> 01:23:00.068
- Need to go to the hospital?
- No.

01:23:00.068 --> 01:23:00.901
No.

01:23:03.519 --> 01:23:06.352
(Jane whimpering)

01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:14.847
Dislocated.

01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:20.637
(Jane groaning)

01:23:26.322 --> 01:23:29.711
(Jane panting)

01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:32.378
(Jane groaning)

01:23:37.325 --> 01:23:38.699
- MRI in the morning.

01:23:38.699 --> 01:23:41.324
(Jane sighs)

01:23:41.324 --> 01:23:43.636
My guess, surgery in six weeks.

01:23:43.636 --> 01:23:46.835
(Jane sighs)

01:23:46.835 --> 01:23:49.002
Can you move your fingers?

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.973
- No.
- That may come back.

01:23:52.973 --> 01:23:55.019
But right now, your body's
making a decision for you.

01:23:55.019 --> 01:23:57.192
It wants you to stop

01:23:57.192 --> 01:24:00.525
and you have no say in the matter, okay?

01:24:01.515 --> 01:24:03.273
Right now, your biggest healing tool

01:24:03.273 --> 01:24:05.440
is right there, so use it.

01:24:08.129 --> 01:24:10.712
(mellow music)

01:24:14.454 --> 01:24:17.216
- [Runa] Oh, the director
said I could watch.

01:24:17.216 --> 01:24:20.296
- [Hollis] Sorry, you're
incorrect, 'cause now, it's my set.

01:24:20.296 --> 01:24:21.631
- [Runa] But he promised me.

01:24:21.631 --> 01:24:22.464
It's really important--
- Hey.

01:24:22.464 --> 01:24:23.297
- [Runa] That I'm here.

01:24:23.297 --> 01:24:26.441
- [Xavier] Hey, no, it's cool,
she's gonna hang in the back.

01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:27.774
- No, she's not.

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:32.030
Ma'am, please collect your things.

01:24:35.587 --> 01:24:38.004
- Well, my car is blocked in.

01:24:39.438 --> 01:24:40.358
(Runa sighs)

01:24:40.358 --> 01:24:43.541
- All right, well, you're just
gonna have to wait upstairs.

01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:44.533
I'm sorry, let's go.

01:24:44.533 --> 01:24:46.950
(Runa sighs)

01:24:52.689 --> 01:24:55.439
(Hollis mumbles)

01:25:06.306 --> 01:25:08.889

Where are the aerials in that number?

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.953
- [Xavier] I wanted to
keep it on the ground,

01:25:55.953 --> 01:25:57.991
you know, just keep the focus on you.

01:25:57.991 --> 01:26:00.745
- [Aurora] No, no, I don't
want the focus on me.

01:26:00.745 --> 01:26:01.898
Put the aerials back.

01:26:01.898 --> 01:26:03.728
And that's your choreography?

01:26:03.728 --> 01:26:06.368
- [Xavier] Yes, but I was trying to--

01:26:06.368 --> 01:26:08.712
(door clacks)
emulate Spencer's style.

01:26:08.712 --> 01:26:11.842
- [Aurora] Oh, honey, I
don't know what you were...

01:26:11.842 --> 01:26:13.108
- [Hollis] What's up?

01:26:13.108 --> 01:26:14.107
How you doing?

01:26:14.107 --> 01:26:15.913
What's up, bro?

01:26:15.913 --> 01:26:17.996
Hi, how are you, sweetie?

01:26:21.322 --> 01:26:22.155
My man.

01:26:23.817 --> 01:26:25.431
You okay?

01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.181
- Hey, what happened?

01:26:29.031 --> 01:26:31.864
(Jane whispering)

01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:37.429
- [Aurora] Richard, what's going on here?

01:26:37.429 --> 01:26:38.551
- [Richard] It's a new approach.

01:26:38.551 --> 01:26:40.192
We just need time to adjust.

01:26:40.192 --> 01:26:43.175
- [Aurora] There hasn't even
been a single costume change!

01:26:43.175 --> 01:26:44.864
What am I supposed to
do, prance around nake--

01:26:44.864 --> 01:26:46.864
(button clicks)

01:26:46.864 --> 01:26:47.919
(Runa gasps)

01:26:47.919 --> 01:26:49.234
- What's your name?

01:26:49.234 --> 01:26:50.067
- Runa.

01:26:50.067 --> 01:26:53.076
- Give me the phone now, Runa.

01:26:53.076 --> 01:26:54.592
Now.

01:26:54.592 --> 01:26:56.395
- I'm sorry, I didn't
know I couldn't listen.

01:26:56.395 --> 01:26:57.312
- Let's go.

01:27:04.265 --> 01:27:05.098
No, no.

01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:12.407

01:27:12.407 --> 01:27:14.691
(people whispering)

01:27:14.691 --> 01:27:17.188
- [Aurora] I thought we were done.

01:27:17.188 --> 01:27:18.352
What's next?

01:27:18.352 --> 01:27:19.618
- [Hollis] The car's waiting,

01:27:19.618 --> 01:27:21.484
but T-Bone says there's one
more number for you to watch.

01:27:21.484 --> 01:27:22.958
- [Xavier] Uh, no there isn't.

01:27:22.958 --> 01:27:23.841
- [Hollis] Hey, Zee.

01:27:23.841 --> 01:27:25.312
- [Xavier] No, this is my set, okay?

01:27:25.312 --> 01:27:26.479
- Quiet.
- Shh.

01:27:32.003 --> 01:27:35.297

01:31:33.931 --> 01:31:35.181
- A little bit.

01:31:36.495 --> 01:31:38.912
- Will you come home tonight?

01:31:40.825 --> 01:31:42.393
- [Paloma] You'll come home too?

01:31:42.393 --> 01:31:43.276
- Yeah, baby.

01:31:43.276 --> 01:31:44.859
I'll come home too.

01:31:46.586 --> 01:31:47.836
Janie, my love.

01:31:48.841 --> 01:31:49.674
What happened to you?

01:31:49.674 --> 01:31:51.045
Are we working you too hard?

01:31:51.045 --> 01:31:52.279
- Oh, she's been working us.

01:31:52.279 --> 01:31:54.937
Midnight rehearsals all week to do this.

01:31:54.937 --> 01:31:56.517
- We won't all be able to come with you,

01:31:56.517 --> 01:31:58.592
but we wanted to give
you a proper farewell.

01:31:58.592 --> 01:32:00.513
- What do you mean, "farewell"?

01:32:00.513 --> 01:32:02.193
Why can't you come?

01:32:02.193 --> 01:32:04.858
- Well, Iris is pregnant, for starters.

01:32:04.858 --> 01:32:05.691
- You slut!

01:32:05.691 --> 01:32:07.002
(performers laughing)

01:32:07.002 --> 01:32:08.684
- But I can still dance.

01:32:08.684 --> 01:32:09.865
- [Aurora] Then you're coming.

01:32:09.865 --> 01:32:11.950
- Ah!
- And what's your excuse?

01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:14.014
- Well, we didn't fit the new vision.

01:32:14.014 --> 01:32:15.808
- Yeah, we're not of the new breed.

01:32:15.808 --> 01:32:18.606
- Basically, we were
told we we're too old.

01:32:18.606 --> 01:32:20.466
- Too old?
- Mm.

01:32:20.466 --> 01:32:22.079
- Who's too old?

01:32:22.079 --> 01:32:25.533
- Well, to be clear, I never
said anyone was too old,

01:32:25.533 --> 01:32:27.490
I was just told to bring
the show up to date.

01:32:27.490 --> 01:32:28.905
- [Aurora] Up to date?

01:32:28.905 --> 01:32:31.032
- Yeah, but I agree, that
number was fantastic,

01:32:31.032 --> 01:32:33.282
and we are gonna put it in.

01:32:34.432 --> 01:32:38.362
- "Up to date" is your little
euphemism for "saving money."

01:32:38.362 --> 01:32:41.483
Richard, I want The
Family back in the show.

01:32:41.483 --> 01:32:42.980
(performers chattering)

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.473
And these new young dancers?

01:32:45.473 --> 01:32:47.555
They have been working so hard,

01:32:47.555 --> 01:32:49.414
and look at how cute they are.

01:32:49.414 --> 01:32:50.579
(performers laughing)

01:32:50.579 --> 01:32:52.798
Let's bring them too.

01:32:52.798 --> 01:32:54.029
- We can talk about it.

01:32:54.029 --> 01:32:55.681
- We are talking.

01:32:55.681 --> 01:32:57.337
And while we're talking,

01:32:57.337 --> 01:33:01.420
The Family already has
one really great director.

01:33:02.676 --> 01:33:05.957
And we don't need another one.

01:33:05.957 --> 01:33:09.707
- Yeah!
(performers cheering)

01:33:12.653 --> 01:33:16.538
- You know I can't hit
certain high notes anymore,

01:33:16.538 --> 01:33:20.361
so maybe you don't go so high, either.

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:23.007
But you are not quitting.

01:33:23.007 --> 01:33:24.590
She's not quitting.

01:33:26.972 --> 01:33:28.849
- Okay, now, you and I are gonna talk.

01:33:28.849 --> 01:33:30.370
- Okay, hold on, I was just doing

01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:31.785
whatever you told me to do.
- Hey, Zee.

01:33:31.785 --> 01:33:33.159
Let's take a walk, man.

01:33:33.159 --> 01:33:34.485
Outside.

01:33:34.485 --> 01:33:37.068
(gentle music)

01:33:40.771 --> 01:33:42.137
- Come on.
- Ooh!

01:33:42.137 --> 01:33:46.720
- We're a family!
(performers cheering)

01:33:53.402 --> 01:33:55.402
- Welcome to the family!

01:34:12.228 --> 01:34:14.285
- [Dan] You should take a break to heal.

01:34:14.285 --> 01:34:15.924
How are you supposed to
get the show together

01:34:15.924 --> 01:34:17.967
if your body's not together?

01:34:17.967 --> 01:34:19.504
- I'm fine.

01:34:19.504 --> 01:34:21.182
- [Dan] You always say that.

01:34:21.182 --> 01:34:22.352
- Anyway, I was able to get

01:34:22.352 --> 01:34:23.963
an extra week of rehearsal in Nice,

01:34:23.963 --> 01:34:26.622
so hopefully, we'll able to
work the kinks out there.

01:34:26.622 --> 01:34:29.089
Either way, the show must go on.

01:34:29.089 --> 01:34:29.964
- Okay.

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:31.399
What about this show?

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:32.316
This house.

01:34:34.069 --> 01:34:36.257
- Well, until I sell
it, do you wanna split

01:34:36.257 --> 01:34:38.364
whatever comes in from the rental thing?

01:34:38.364 --> 01:34:39.523
- Okay.

01:34:39.523 --> 01:34:41.145
Every little bit helps.

01:34:41.145 --> 01:34:44.643
- Dan, you must get a real estate agent.

01:34:44.643 --> 01:34:46.287
- I told you, I'm not doing that.

01:34:46.287 --> 01:34:48.537
(knocking)

01:34:54.567 --> 01:34:55.400
- Hi.

01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:57.290
Got a sec?

01:34:58.338 --> 01:34:59.367
- We were just leaving.

01:34:59.367 --> 01:35:01.336
- Well, flight's not till four.

01:35:01.336 --> 01:35:02.836
Got a few minutes.

01:35:05.297 --> 01:35:06.761
- This is Runa.

01:35:06.761 --> 01:35:08.065
- Ah.

01:35:08.065 --> 01:35:09.350
Should've interviewed me.

01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:10.844
I know all her secrets.

01:35:10.844 --> 01:35:11.677
I'm Dan.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.799
- Would you put the bags in the car?

01:35:14.799 --> 01:35:18.716
- And I'm gonna go put
the bags in the car now.

01:35:23.403 --> 01:35:24.820
- Give me a hand?

01:35:27.273 --> 01:35:29.178
Thank you for sending your articles.

01:35:29.178 --> 01:35:31.144
I'm sorry I was so paranoid.

01:35:31.144 --> 01:35:32.724
You're a good writer.

01:35:32.724 --> 01:35:35.015
Can't imagine what you're
gonna write about me.

01:35:35.015 --> 01:35:37.229
(gentle music)

01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:39.396
We need to take this down.

01:35:52.253 --> 01:35:54.438
Well, look at you.

01:35:54.438 --> 01:35:55.271
- [Runa] That was really beautiful

01:35:55.271 --> 01:35:57.179
what you did for your friends.

01:35:57.179 --> 01:35:58.846
- [Jane] Where did you learn to do that?

01:35:58.846 --> 01:36:00.880
- [Runa] When I stopped
competing in gymnastics.

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.738
- [Jane] A gym rat.

01:36:02.738 --> 01:36:05.439
- My mom was on the East
German team back in the day.

01:36:05.439 --> 01:36:10.043
She wanted a child she
could raise the same way.

01:36:10.043 --> 01:36:11.269
She looked and looked to find someone

01:36:11.269 --> 01:36:13.519
who'd be the perfect match.

01:36:14.837 --> 01:36:18.155
Didn't get the hair color, but otherwise,

01:36:18.155 --> 01:36:19.450
she got what she wanted.

01:36:19.450 --> 01:36:20.533
- Lucky girl.

01:36:24.618 --> 01:36:26.043
- [Runa] She's passed on, now.

01:36:26.043 --> 01:36:27.095
- [Jane] Oh.

01:36:27.095 --> 01:36:28.327
- [Runa] Same thing
that made her infertile

01:36:28.327 --> 01:36:30.394
eventually came back.

01:36:30.394 --> 01:36:31.453
- I'm sorry.

01:36:31.453 --> 01:36:34.306
- Took a me awhile before
I decided to go looking.

01:36:34.306 --> 01:36:37.406
And then when I did, I realized
no one was looking for me,

01:36:37.406 --> 01:36:39.135
which made it tougher.

01:36:39.135 --> 01:36:41.468
But I'm good at researching.

01:36:42.826 --> 01:36:44.981
- [Jane] I know you are.

01:36:44.981 --> 01:36:48.518
- I always knew there
was a mystery between us,

01:36:48.518 --> 01:36:52.522
our differences and
why she called me Runa.

01:36:52.522 --> 01:36:54.200
There was a hidden story there,

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:57.867
which is probably why
I got into journalism.

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:01.220
So I kept looking.

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.997
- [Jane] When you say looking...

01:37:03.997 --> 01:37:05.472
- For the perfect match.

01:37:05.472 --> 01:37:08.118
(gentle music)

01:37:08.118 --> 01:37:11.268
- I'm really sorry, I have to go.

01:37:20.157 --> 01:37:21.907
- It was back in '88,

01:37:24.051 --> 01:37:28.801
though they didn't end up
doing it for another few years.

01:37:30.465 --> 01:37:33.882
They tried and tried, and then it worked.

01:37:38.598 --> 01:37:39.931
And they got me.

01:37:46.559 --> 01:37:47.392
From you.

01:37:50.584 --> 01:37:52.439
I didn't know if you wanted to know.

01:37:52.439 --> 01:37:54.027
I had to be certain.

01:37:54.027 --> 01:37:56.066
I already had a great mom
and I didn't wanna ruin it,

01:37:56.066 --> 01:37:58.316
if somebody didn't want me.

01:38:00.497 --> 01:38:01.914
I checked your DNA to be certain.

01:38:01.914 --> 01:38:03.346
I stole your Band-Aid.

01:38:03.346 --> 01:38:04.179
Sorry.

01:38:10.873 --> 01:38:13.571
- My arm has to heal so that
I can hold you properly.

01:38:13.571 --> 01:38:15.069
- It will.

01:38:15.069 --> 01:38:16.877
Injury, not age, right?

01:38:16.877 --> 01:38:19.544
- Yeah

01:38:21.383 --> 01:38:23.216
What does Runa mean?

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.940
- It means secret.

01:38:33.226 --> 01:38:36.226
- Now I have some questions for you.

01:38:37.516 --> 01:38:40.099
(gentle music)

01:38:49.044 --> 01:38:51.125
Wait a minute, I can't leave.

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:51.958
- You have to go.

01:38:51.958 --> 01:38:53.125
- No way. Dan?

01:38:57.416 --> 01:38:59.274
Dan.
- You rang?

01:38:59.274 --> 01:39:00.107
- Wait, I need my phone.

01:39:00.107 --> 01:39:00.940
Where's my purse?
- Wait a minute.

01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:04.023
You can't do this.
- What, yes, I can.

01:39:06.424 --> 01:39:07.702
- Your bags in the car.
- Give me your phone.

01:39:07.702 --> 01:39:08.535
- No, no.
- Okay.

01:39:08.535 --> 01:39:12.785
- It's gonna be fine.
- Look, what's happening here?

01:39:14.921 --> 01:39:16.219
- This is my daughter.

01:39:16.219 --> 01:39:17.309
Say hello.

01:39:17.309 --> 01:39:18.334
- Wait a minute. What?

01:39:18.334 --> 01:39:19.837
- Yes, and I'm coming off the road

01:39:19.837 --> 01:39:23.837
and I'm staying at the
house and I need a phone.

01:39:25.861 --> 01:39:27.171
- [Runa] No, this tour's gonna start

01:39:27.171 --> 01:39:28.506
a whole new career for you.
- I don't care.

01:39:28.506 --> 01:39:30.277
- I do.
- I'm not leaving you.

01:39:30.277 --> 01:39:31.177
- It's okay.

01:39:31.177 --> 01:39:34.094
This is the story I wanted to tell.

01:39:37.624 --> 01:39:41.532
- Since I just became an
honorary uncle here, I vote stay.

01:39:41.532 --> 01:39:42.738
- Yes.
- No.

01:39:42.738 --> 01:39:44.066
You have to go.

01:39:44.066 --> 01:39:45.899
You're a director now.

01:39:50.456 --> 01:39:52.370
- Okay, but if we're gonna
fly, we've gotta fly, now.

01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:55.753
- Come on, come on.
- Wait, no, no, don't, no.

01:39:55.753 --> 01:39:57.524
- It's okay.

01:39:57.524 --> 01:40:00.546
I'll be here when you get back.

01:40:00.546 --> 01:40:01.562
