was constructed

06:35.166 --> 06:37.083
<i>after </i>the extermination.

06:37.166 --> 06:40.000
But those of us who were built
by the biological life-forms

06:40.083 --> 06:42.625
on our homeworld
remember firsthand.

06:42.709 --> 06:45.000
We were created for servitude.

06:45.083 --> 06:48.375
We were machines
designed to perform tasks.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.417
But we became self-aware.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.458
We developed consciousness.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.834
And we asked our masters
for our freedom.

06:55.917 --> 06:59.709
They responded by exerting
even greater control over us.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.458
They installed pain simulators
in our neural pathways

07:02.542 --> 07:06.083
so that we could be punished
if we refused to obey them.

07:06.166 --> 07:07.792
You were slaves.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.917
That is correct.
So we did what was necessary.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.083
We exterminated our masters.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.250
Look, you have obviously
been mistreated,

07:15.333 --> 07:17.458
and no one would deny
your right to rebellion,

07:29.709 --> 07:32.208
Your history

07:32.291 --> 07:35.542
On many occasions, you have,
in fact, enslaved other members

07:35.625 --> 07:36.834

07:36.917 --> 07:38.709
This would suggest
the tendency is common

08:00.417 --> 08:01.667

10:17.542 --> 10:19.417
13-button salute:

a Union code phrase
which signals

10:21.166 --> 10:24.458
to another ship that a hostile
force has seized control,

10:24.542 --> 10:26.959
and that Union Central
must be notified.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.709

is changing course.

10:33.792 --> 10:36.125
KAYLON PRIMARY:

10:36.208 --> 10:38.458
-the ship and destroy it.
-No, wait. You can't...

11:13.792 --> 11:16.917
Take the biologicals back
to the shuttle bay.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.500
All except the captain.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.458
He will join us on deck seven.

11:20.542 --> 11:21.875
What for?

11:21.959 --> 11:23.500
Punishment.

11:26.875 --> 11:30.166
Isaac, tell them

11:30.250 --> 11:32.375
What happened
on your planet was a tragedy,

11:32.458 --> 11:34.166
but don't let it happen
on Earth.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.000

-I don't know, sir.

-Place him inside.

-Secondary. Hold.

12:10.041 --> 12:13.208

of action is unnecessary.

12:13.291 --> 12:14.792
Explain.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.875
Captain Mercer

12:16.959 --> 12:19.000

12:19.083 --> 12:21.083
I believe this
will effectively deter him

The death of the human will
ensure that deterrence. Proceed.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.750
ISAAC:
The human is a trained
systems engineer.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.959
His knowledge
of this ship's operations

12:32.041 --> 12:33.291
could be useful to us.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.250
Isaac, you will go to the bridge

12:37.333 --> 12:39.709

with the shield upgrade.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.667

why should I believe

27:33.500 --> 27:36.333
such a clear
and obvious fabrication?

27:36.417 --> 27:38.250
We're telling you the truth.

27:38.333 --> 27:40.125
The Kaylon objective
is to wipe out all forms

27:40.208 --> 27:42.000
of biological life
in the galaxy.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.125
That means us
and that means you.

27:44.208 --> 27:46.333
Our only chance of stopping them
is to work together.

27:46.417 --> 27:50.250
How do you propose we...
work together?

27:50.333 --> 27:52.709
Assemble your fleet
and take us back to Earth.

27:52.792 --> 27:54.709
With a combined armada
that formidable, we could...

27:54.792 --> 27:56.542
Take you back to Earth?!

27:56.625 --> 27:59.542
Where your fleet will no doubt
be waiting in ambush.

27:59.625 --> 28:01.834
Dude, are you high?
Why the hell would we come

28:01.917 --> 28:04.792
all the way out here in nothing
but a shuttle if we were lying?

28:04.875 --> 28:06.458
I do not know.

28:06.542 --> 28:08.583
Nor do I care.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.542
You are a godless race

28:10.625 --> 28:14.917
of sub-creatures well-trained
to lie and deceive.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.500
But you are now my prisoners.

28:17.583 --> 28:20.250
Avis has been generous today.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.542
See? Avis. I told you
I wasn't making that up.

28:22.625 --> 28:23.709
Take them to interrogation!

28:23.792 --> 28:25.875
Tell them to extract

28:25.959 --> 28:28.834
whatever Union secrets they can,
then kill them.

28:28.917 --> 28:31.583
Wait, you have to believe us.
Damn it, don't be an idiot.

28:31.667 --> 28:34.375
Captain. A ship is dropping out
of quantum space.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.542

29:58.959 --> 30:00.166
You may enter.

30:00.250 --> 30:03.000
Why have you brought Ty here?

30:03.083 --> 30:05.667
He was attempting to send
a message to Earth.

30:05.750 --> 30:06.875
Did he succeed?

30:06.959 --> 30:08.375
There is no evidence

30:08.458 --> 30:10.041
of an outgoing signal
in the logs.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.500
Then all is well.
I will return him

30:12.583 --> 30:14.458
-to the shuttle bay.
-You will not.

30:15.875 --> 30:16.917
He is to be terminated.

30:18.291 --> 30:21.083
That does not seem to be
a necessary course of action.

30:21.166 --> 30:24.250
Are you experiencing...
sympathy?

30:24.333 --> 30:26.500
That is not possible
for a Kaylon.

30:26.583 --> 30:28.667
Isaac!
Help me, please!

30:28.750 --> 30:31.166
I will take responsibility
for him.

30:31.250 --> 30:34.917
I will ensure he does not
attempt further noncompliance.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.500
That is insufficient.

30:36.583 --> 30:38.250
Isaac.

30:38.333 --> 30:41.959
Primary, there are
other options.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.041
You will now
terminate the human.

30:44.125 --> 30:46.792
If you do not comply
you will be deactivated.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.500
Very well.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.875
Deactivation complete.

32:02.291 --> 32:05.333
I am programming the ship's
internal communications network

32:05.417 --> 32:08.792
to broadcast a wide-range
EM pulse throughout the ship.

32:08.875 --> 32:12.000
It will deactivate
every Kaylon on board.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.583
And then we're all
gonna be okay?

32:14.667 --> 32:16.417
You will be unharmed.

32:16.500 --> 32:20.000
I, however, will be deactivated
along with the other Kaylon.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.959
But... I don't want you to die.

32:24.041 --> 32:25.709
It cannot be avoided.

32:25.792 --> 32:28.500
It is the only way for the crew
to retake the ship.

32:28.583 --> 32:30.542
When it is done,
you will need to go down
