this is for mommy

06:57.751 --> 06:59.253
so l-let's get it perfect, okay?

06:59.294 --> 07:00.254
Here we go. Take two.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.714
♪ What day is today ♪♪

07:02.756 --> 07:04.632
Can't do it.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.930
- Why not?

07:06.343 --> 07:09.930
- Mommy's not here.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.307
Yes, guys, I-I realize

07:09.971 --> 07:12.307
that mommy's not here.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.975
Please, kids,

07:12.349 --> 07:13.975
let's concentrate.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.144
Now, we gotta make this

07:14.017 --> 07:16.144
thing perfect for mommy.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.063
This is very important.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.063
Let's try it from the top.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.564
- You ready?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.564
- No.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.191
Hey-hey, get back,

07:19.606 --> 07:21.191
come on, guys.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.526
We have to learn

07:21.233 --> 07:23.526
this song for mommy.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.948
Oh, magic cue ball

07:27.989 --> 07:30.992
will D.J's date

07:27.989 --> 07:30.992
tonight be cute?

07:31.034 --> 07:32.786
Michelle, cute isn't everything.

07:32.827 --> 07:36.039
It's more about his sense

07:32.827 --> 07:36.039
of humor, his personality.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.416
Okay.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.917
Oh, magic cue ball

07:38.959 --> 07:40.377
will D.J's date tonight

07:40.419 --> 07:42.254
have a good personality?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.008
You better hope he's cute.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.304
Well, what do you think?

07:50.345 --> 07:52.264
Do I look ready

07:50.345 --> 07:52.264
for my big date or what?

07:52.306 --> 07:55.434
I even, uh, I even

07:52.306 --> 07:55.434
high-buffed the shoes.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.019
Wow, dad, you look great.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.479
And cool socks.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.479
Where'd you get 'em?

07:59.520 --> 08:00.939
Oh, thanks. Th-these socks?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.233
I got 'em, uh..

08:03.275 --> 08:05.152
Oh, my God.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.070
Vicky gave me these socks.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.280
I-I..

08:08.322 --> 08:10.031
What if Leona asks me

08:08.322 --> 08:10.031
where I got them?

08:10.073 --> 08:11.574
I..

08:11.616 --> 08:13.743
...I can't talk

08:11.616 --> 08:13.743
about one woman's socks

08:13.785 --> 08:16.163
on a date with another woman.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.581
Trust me, dad, if you're talking

08:16.204 --> 08:18.581
about your socks

08:18.623 --> 08:21.251
date's already dead

08:18.623 --> 08:21.251
in the water.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.669
Now, you know what, I think

08:21.293 --> 08:22.669
I'm gonna go for that

08:22.710 --> 08:25.213
that hip, sockless,

08:22.710 --> 08:25.213
European look.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.506
Of course, at the end

08:25.255 --> 08:26.506
of the night

08:26.547 --> 08:28.091
I'm gonna have

08:26.547 --> 08:28.091
to burn these shoes.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.384
[doorbell rings]

08:29.426 --> 08:30.927
I'll get it.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.347
Don't worry, dad,

08:30.969 --> 08:33.347
I asked the magic cue ball

08:33.388 --> 08:35.640
if you guys were gonna have

08:33.388 --> 08:35.640
fun time tonight

08:35.682 --> 08:38.893
and it said

08:35.682 --> 08:38.893
it's absolutely certain.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.687
Thanks, sweetie,

08:38.935 --> 08:40.687
but I think the only thing

08:40.728 --> 08:42.147
that's absolutely certain is..

08:42.189 --> 08:43.857
...I should've shaved my ankles.

08:45.484 --> 08:46.693
- Hi.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.320
I'm Roger. You D.J.?

08:48.362 --> 08:50.071
- I certainly hope so.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.071
- Oh.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.906
I mean yes.

08:51.948 --> 08:56.036
Come on in.

08:51.948 --> 08:56.036
Um, Roger...this is everybody.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.620
- Hi.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.620
- 'Hi.'

08:57.662 --> 09:01.333
Wow. You've really grown

08:57.662 --> 09:01.333
since Christmas '78.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.294
Excuse me.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.294
I'm, uh, I'm sorry, I'm, uh..

09:04.336 --> 09:06.129
- I'm D.J's dad.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.129
- How you doing?

09:06.171 --> 09:07.755
Good, I-I couldn't help

09:06.171 --> 09:07.755
but notice

09:07.797 --> 09:09.632
you've got

09:07.797 --> 09:09.632
a fine mustache there.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.884
Oh, thanks.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.386
You ought to see it

09:10.925 --> 09:12.386
in natural light.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.097
Just out of, uh,

09:14.012 --> 09:16.097
parental curiosity

09:16.139 --> 09:17.682
um, h-how old are you?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.101
- I'm 20.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.101
- 20?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.312
Big 2-0.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.606
No longer a teen

09:22.354 --> 09:25.606
but...dating one.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.902
[chuckles]

09:25.648 --> 09:28.902
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.695
I'm embarrassing you?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.695
Did you see his mustache?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.447
I can't even grow

09:30.737 --> 09:32.447
a mustache like that.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.076
Dad, I'm 17. He's 20.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.618
There's only

09:36.117 --> 09:37.618
three years difference.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.995
Only three years?

09:39.037 --> 09:41.415
That's an entire lifetime

09:39.037 --> 09:41.415
for a goldfish.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.251
I'll be fine.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.545
- Roger, we better get going.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.545
- Right.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.754
Well, goodnight, Mr. Tanner.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.130
Good..

09:47.795 --> 09:49.130
Sorry.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.800
[instrumental music]

09:52.842 --> 09:55.887
[indistinct chattering]

10:01.976 --> 10:03.853
So I started off

10:01.976 --> 10:03.853
with a full beard

10:03.895 --> 10:05.480
well, then trimmed it

10:03.895 --> 10:05.480
down to a goatee.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.940
But, yeah,

10:05.522 --> 10:06.940
that didn't work out

10:06.981 --> 10:09.317
so I lost the beard

10:06.981 --> 10:09.317
and grew the mustache back

10:09.359 --> 10:11.152
which is the look

10:09.359 --> 10:11.152
you're enjoying today.

10:13.196 --> 10:16.074
Yeah. It really brings

10:13.196 --> 10:16.074
out your...nostrils.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.409
[chuckles]

10:19.494 --> 10:21.704
Oh, look-look at this,

10:19.494 --> 10:21.704
Mr. and Mrs. Bush.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.541
They recommend

10:21.746 --> 10:24.541
the Michael Dukakis Burger.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.167
[laughing]

10:26.209 --> 10:28.378
That-that's my daughter D.J.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.214
Hey, Deej.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.924
- Dad.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.924
- Hey.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.301
What are you guys doing here?

10:34.342 --> 10:35.885
What happened to that

10:34.342 --> 10:35.885
fancy French restaurant

10:35.927 --> 10:37.220
you were going to?

10:37.262 --> 10:38.555
Well, we-we were gonna go there

10:38.597 --> 10:42.309
but we decided

10:38.597 --> 10:42.309
it was, you know, too '90s.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.519
Oh, D.J., Roger,

10:42.350 --> 10:44.519
this is Leona.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.521
- Hi.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.521
- How do you do?

10:46.563 --> 10:49.149
Great mustache.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.400
Well, thank you.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.860
It started off

10:50.442 --> 10:52.860
as a full beard.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.362
Really?

10:55.738 --> 10:58.617
[scoffs]

10:55.738 --> 10:58.617
You know, it's a long story.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.993
It was nice chatting with you.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.286
Hey, why don't you join us?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.621
- No, we'd really--

11:01.328 --> 11:02.621
- Oh, love to.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.372
We'd really love to.

11:06.249 --> 11:09.294
- D.J.?

11:06.249 --> 11:09.294
- Arthur?

11:09.336 --> 11:12.880
I thought I recognized

11:09.336 --> 11:12.880
the back of your head.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.300
Arthur sits behind me

11:12.922 --> 11:15.300
in biology.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.136
Well, uh, I'll see you around.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.973
Or from behind

11:18.178 --> 11:21.973
...or whatever.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.475
Ah-heh.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.560
So.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.562
Uh...where were we?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.399
Leona, your eyes.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.609
What would you call them..

11:32.651 --> 11:34.569
...green?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.655
Well, I call the left one green.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.073
I call the right one tiger.

[roaring]

11:40.158 --> 11:41.409
[laughing]

11:46.456 --> 11:47.999
Say, Leona,

11:46.456 --> 11:47.999
what do you say

11:48.041 --> 11:51.044
we take a little walk

11:48.041 --> 11:51.044
over to the, uh, lobster tank?

11:51.085 --> 11:53.463
Oh, I would love that..

11:53.505 --> 11:54.839
...Rog.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.938
Those two..

12:10.980 --> 12:12.691
...they're not coming back,

12:10.980 --> 12:12.691
are they?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.361
Excuse me, Arthur?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.196
Where's your lobster tank?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.489
We don't have one.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.867
No, dad, they're not

12:20.574 --> 12:22.867
coming back.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.717
Wasn't there a foursome here?

12:38.757 --> 12:41.302
Actually, it started off

12:38.757 --> 12:41.302
as a twosome.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.637
Then became a foursome.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.097
But went back to a twosome.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.682
A different twosome.

12:45.724 --> 12:46.933
A depressed twosome.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.477
Just think.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.146
If I hadn't asked,

12:49.519 --> 12:52.146
I wouldn't have known.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.694
Man, this dating thing

12:55.024 --> 12:57.694
is tougher than I thought.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.906
And getting tougher

12:59.904 --> 13:01.906
all the time.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.076
Hi, guys.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.703
- Hi.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.703
- Hi, Steve.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.374
So...isn't this a great place

13:11.416 --> 13:13.960
to bring a date...or a parent?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.632
Right, well, anyway,

13:16.212 --> 13:18.632
this is Ada Cooling.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.593
Ada, this is Mr. Tanner,

13:18.673 --> 13:21.593
and this is D.J.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.344
D.J?

13:23.386 --> 13:25.012
What a coincidence!

13:25.054 --> 13:27.515
Steve, you used to date a D.J.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.058
Y-yeah.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.816
Oh, Steve, there's Pac-Man.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.445
I have his autograph at home.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.447
Oh, that-that's wonderful, Ada.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.574
Well, why don't we go see

13:42.489 --> 13:44.574
if he remembers you?

13:46.367 --> 13:49.203
- Bye.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.203
- See you later, Deej.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.371
That was fixed up.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.500
[sighs]

13:53.541 --> 13:54.709
What a night.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.086
Yeah. I- I've had better..

13:57.128 --> 13:58.921
Like every one before this.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.050
Hey, D.J.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.051
Hey, Arthur.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.386
Um, my shift is over

14:05.428 --> 14:07.013
and I'm going

14:05.428 --> 14:07.013
to Samantha's party.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.516
If you're going,

14:07.054 --> 14:09.516
I can give you a lift.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.810
Oh, no, I think I'm just

14:09.557 --> 14:11.810
gonna hang out here

14:11.850 --> 14:14.813
with my friend...dad.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.064
No, you know what.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.064
Don't worry about me.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.899
I-I assume you have

14:17.106 --> 14:18.899
a license, insurance

14:18.941 --> 14:20.860
and you-you've passed

14:18.941 --> 14:20.860
an approved driver's ed course?

14:20.901 --> 14:22.278
Yeah.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.614
You know, what,

14:22.320 --> 14:24.614
then go. Go. Have fun.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.324
You're young,

14:24.656 --> 14:26.324
get out of here

14:26.366 --> 14:28.743
before life passes you by and..

14:28.785 --> 14:31.579
[sighs]

14:28.785 --> 14:31.579
You wind up sitting alone

14:28.785 --> 14:31.579
in a trendy restaurant

14:31.621 --> 14:33.998
with hairy ankles

14:31.621 --> 14:33.998
and socks in your pocket.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.337
Are you sure you don't mind?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.130
I'll be fine. Have fun.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.382
Thanks, dad.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.382
You're the best.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.591
I am, aren't I?

14:43.633 --> 14:44.759
Bye.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.722
- Bye, Mr. Tanner.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.722
- Bye.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.226
Loneliness.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.936
Thy name is Danny.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.233
Have you seen the busboy?

15:00.274 --> 15:03.027
Yeah, he just left

15:00.274 --> 15:03.027
with my daughter.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.696
Would you feel the grease

15:03.069 --> 15:04.696
on this table?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.573
You could fry an egg on it.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.825
Really?

15:10.493 --> 15:11.745
Can I-can I help you?

15:11.786 --> 15:13.747
Oh, please.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.331
Great. Excuse me.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.626
My mom used to have

15:15.373 --> 15:18.626
a little-little cleaning rhyme.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.795
She said when you've

15:18.668 --> 15:20.795
cleaned your place

15:20.837 --> 15:23.631
you can see your face.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.007
There I am.

15:27.719 --> 15:28.803
Enjoy.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.389
Oh, thank you.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.389
That's very sweet.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.891
You don't see that combination

15:32.932 --> 15:36.477
of chivalry

15:32.932 --> 15:36.477
and compulsiveness anymore.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.733
At least I got that

15:38.730 --> 15:41.733
going for me.

15:41.775 --> 15:42.901
Sit.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.695
Sit.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.530
Yes, ma'am.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.452
Are we feeling

15:49.490 --> 15:52.452
a little sorry for our self?

15:53.912 --> 15:56.539
Yes, we are.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.999
My-my little daughter's

15:56.581 --> 15:58.999
magic cue ball

15:59.041 --> 16:01.461
said that tonight

15:59.041 --> 16:01.461
was going to be a fun night.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.170
I mean, I know

16:01.502 --> 16:03.170
it's just a silly little toy

16:03.212 --> 16:05.632
but I was kind of hoping

16:03.212 --> 16:05.632
it would be right.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.302
Well, you never know

16:05.673 --> 16:09.302
what's around the corner.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.887
- Hi, sweetie.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.887
- Hi, mom.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.138
Hi.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.890
Sorry, I'm late.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.141
This is..

16:15.182 --> 16:17.101
Oh, sorry,

16:15.182 --> 16:17.101
I didn't catch your name.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.312
Mom, that's Danny Tanner.

16:19.353 --> 16:23.274
He's the star of

16:19.353 --> 16:23.274
"Wake Up, San Francisco."

16:23.316 --> 16:24.859
I know this is gonna sound silly

16:24.901 --> 16:26.694
but I've had a crush on you

16:26.736 --> 16:28.446
for the longest time.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.166
- Hello, darling.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.166
- Oh.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.627
- Jess.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.627
- Yes.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.378
Let's not do anything,

16:42.669 --> 16:44.378
the boys won't let us finish.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.714
The boys are downstairs

16:44.420 --> 16:46.714
with Joey

16:46.756 --> 16:48.257
and I'm just getting started.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.509
[chuckles]

16:50.510 --> 16:53.513
- Mama! Mama!

16:53.554 --> 16:54.889
'Mama!'

16:54.931 --> 16:56.307
Now I'm finished.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.976
'Mommy, mommy.'

16:58.017 --> 16:59.310
(both)

16:58.017 --> 16:59.310
Happy Mother's Day.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.479
- Oh.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.479
- Guys, guys, guys.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.981
Mother's Day's not

17:01.521 --> 17:02.981
till tomorrow.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.985
- What are you doing?

17:03.063 --> 17:06.985
- I love mama tonight.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.402
Oh.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.154
Give me a hug. I love you.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.322
Joey, what are you doing?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.532
I thought

17:11.364 --> 17:12.532
you were gonna occupy

17:12.573 --> 17:14.325
the kids downstairs,

17:12.573 --> 17:14.325
we had a plan.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.535
Well, the boys

17:14.367 --> 17:15.535
had a better one.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.787
Biting my ankles

17:15.576 --> 17:17.787
until I gave in.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.581
Oh, honey, it's okay.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.125
- Look. They brought us a snack.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.125
- Mm-hm.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.336
It's breakfast, mama.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.254
Yeah, Beck, the boys whipped

17:25.378 --> 17:27.254
a little, uh..

17:27.296 --> 17:30.967
Donut, candy, guacamole

17:27.296 --> 17:30.967
buffet together.

17:31.009 --> 17:34.387
Of course, I added the Doritos

17:31.009 --> 17:34.387
for fiber content.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.184
Beck, we had this whole

17:38.016 --> 17:40.184
great morning planned out.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.519
We were gonna make

17:40.226 --> 17:41.519
you this breakfast

17:41.561 --> 17:43.021
with this-this

17:41.561 --> 17:43.021
heart-shaped omelet

17:43.062 --> 17:45.940
with-with a parsley arrow

17:43.062 --> 17:45.940
going through it.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.401
Guys, listen,

17:45.982 --> 17:48.401
take Joey downstairs occupy him.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.236
We're gonna do this whole thing

17:48.442 --> 17:50.236
right tomorrow morning.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.988
Happy Mother's Day.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.197
Happy Mother's Day.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.366
Oh, thank you.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.409
Let me see what you..

17:56.450 --> 17:57.493
Ohh.

17:57.535 --> 17:58.786
Ohh.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.287
- Ohh.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.287
- Turn in that ways.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.581
Let me see.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.584
Oh, thank..

18:01.622 --> 18:04.584
Oh, Jess.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.670
These little hand prints

18:04.625 --> 18:07.670
are adorable.

18:07.712 --> 18:08.963
'Guys, not the presents.'

18:09.005 --> 18:10.548
We were supposed

18:09.005 --> 18:10.548
to wrap 'em up nice.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.133
We had this special

18:10.590 --> 18:13.133
Mother's Day wrapping.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.844
When am I gonna use

18:13.175 --> 18:14.844
that again this year?

18:16.470 --> 18:19.557
Time to sing the song.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.225
Oh, Jess,

18:19.599 --> 18:21.225
they're gonna sing me a song.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.061
No, they're not.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.061
I draw the line at the song.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.063
Guys, we have to save

18:23.102 --> 18:25.063
something for tomorrow.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.773
- Sing it now!

18:26.814 --> 18:28.315
Sing it now!

18:28.357 --> 18:29.901
(in unison)

18:28.357 --> 18:29.901
Sing it now!

18:29.943 --> 18:31.277
Sing it now!

18:31.318 --> 18:33.696
Joey!

18:33.738 --> 18:36.115
I happen to like the song.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.325
Oh, come on.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.325
Jess, let's hear the song.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.328
Oh, Alright. Alright.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.328
Everyone sit down.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.580
Everyone sit down.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.895
Beck, I-I just-I just wanted

19:03.977 --> 19:05.895
the whole day

19:05.937 --> 19:08.481
to be perfect, and now, eh.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.484
Honey, it is perfect.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.028
I mean who cares

19:11.525 --> 19:14.028
if the presents aren't wrapped

19:14.070 --> 19:17.782
or if I'm eating a Dorito

19:14.070 --> 19:17.782
breakfast at 8 o'clock at night.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.451
I mean, the point

19:18.825 --> 19:20.451
of Mother's Day

19:20.493 --> 19:23.037
is to show your mom

19:20.493 --> 19:23.037
how much you love her

19:23.079 --> 19:26.206
and...right now

19:23.079 --> 19:26.206
I feel pretty loved.

19:29.627 --> 19:34.256
And I love that you guys

19:29.627 --> 19:34.256
did this all by yourselves.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.382
- 'Yeah.'

19:34.298 --> 19:35.382
- Come here and give me a hug.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.592
Yeah.

19:36.634 --> 19:37.927
Oh, I love you.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.846
- Oh, I..

19:37.969 --> 19:39.846
- Yeah..

19:39.887 --> 19:42.598
You know, Beck,

19:39.887 --> 19:42.598
I-I helped out quite a bit.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.391
I mean when those kids

19:42.640 --> 19:44.391
came to me

19:44.433 --> 19:46.393
they-they didn't even know

19:44.433 --> 19:46.393
that song.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.855
I know, I know.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.357
Okay, boys, boys, come here.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.357
I gotta tell you something.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.900
I'm sorry I pushed you guys.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.819
I was just trying

19:52.942 --> 19:54.819
to make it perfect.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.738
Thank you, my baby,

19:54.861 --> 19:57.738
baby, thank you.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.490
Now, you guys had

19:57.780 --> 19:59.490
the right idea.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.160
After all,

19:59.532 --> 20:02.160
she is your mommy, right?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.619
Aw, Jess. Let's face it.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.789
We have the greatest kids

20:03.661 --> 20:06.789
in the world.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.170
[whimpering]

20:14.088 --> 20:15.422
All three of them.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.843
Come on over here, you big kid.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.053
Come on, Joey.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.186
Wait for it.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.688
Now!

20:36.402 --> 20:38.362
D.J., how do you breathe?

20:42.491 --> 20:44.451
Arthur, I'd like you

20:42.491 --> 20:44.451
to meet my sisters.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.536
Hi, how're you doing?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.662
- Hi.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.662
- Hello.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.122
But, uh, don't get too attached.

20:48.164 --> 20:51.125
They might not be living

20:48.164 --> 20:51.125
much longer.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.253
So, uh, I guess I'll see you

20:51.167 --> 20:54.253
in biology on Monday?

20:54.294 --> 20:58.257
Great, and I think I'll be

20:54.294 --> 20:58.257
turning around a lot more.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.675
Bye.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.635
Goodnight, Arthur.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.473
Now, correct me if I'm wrong

21:06.515 --> 21:08.059
but wasn't Roger taller, broader

21:08.101 --> 21:09.435
and not named Arthur?

21:09.476 --> 21:11.645
It's a long story.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.645
Where's dad?

21:11.687 --> 21:12.813
He's not home yet.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.648
He's not?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.817
I left him hours ago.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.570
He could be walking the streets,

21:16.859 --> 21:19.570
miserable and alone.

21:20.696 --> 21:24.700
♪ Hello my darling daughters ♪♪

21:24.742 --> 21:25.868
Ho!

21:27.245 --> 21:30.539
Boy, I've never

21:27.245 --> 21:30.539
seen him so depressed.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.291
Dad, what happened?

21:30.581 --> 21:32.291
Are you okay?

21:32.332 --> 21:33.626
T-this has been

21:32.332 --> 21:33.626
an amazing night.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.003
I-I was sitting there

21:33.667 --> 21:36.003
all depressed

21:36.045 --> 21:37.296
and alone in the restaurant

21:37.337 --> 21:38.756
saying to myself

21:37.337 --> 21:38.756
over and over again

21:38.798 --> 21:41.175
"I will not cry.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.175
I will not cry."

21:41.217 --> 21:43.469
And all of a sudden,

21:41.217 --> 21:43.469
this-this really sweet

21:43.510 --> 21:46.222
older lady asked me to help

21:43.510 --> 21:46.222
get some grease off her table.

21:46.264 --> 21:47.890
Of course,

21:46.264 --> 21:47.890
I came to the rescue.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.642
Next thing I know,

21:47.932 --> 21:49.642
I'm rollerblading

21:49.683 --> 21:50.684
through Golden Gate Park

21:50.726 --> 21:52.228
with her beautiful daughter.

21:52.270 --> 21:55.606
Wow, yeah. I had a really

21:52.270 --> 21:55.606
great time tonight, too.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.524
I guess we're back

21:55.648 --> 21:57.524
in circulation.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.985
- Groovy, man.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.985
- Hey, solid.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.319
[chuckles]

22:00.360 --> 22:02.196
I'm never wearing

22:00.360 --> 22:02.196
socks again.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.450
Now, Deej, wait.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.077
How did Roger turn into Arthur?

22:09.120 --> 22:11.164
And what happened to Leona?

22:11.205 --> 22:12.748
Why am I so out of the loop?

22:12.790 --> 22:14.583
[sighs]

22:14.625 --> 22:16.418
See, the magic cue ball said

22:16.460 --> 22:18.587
you guys were gonna

22:16.460 --> 22:18.587
have a fun night.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.299
Michelle, D.J. and I didn't

22:18.629 --> 22:21.299
have a fun night

22:21.340 --> 22:23.801
just because the magic cue ball

22:21.340 --> 22:23.801
said we would.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.427
We had a good time

22:23.843 --> 22:25.427
because we decided

22:25.469 --> 22:27.305
to stop feeling sorry

22:25.469 --> 22:27.305
for ourselves

22:27.345 --> 22:31.349
and you know, just go out and

22:27.345 --> 22:31.349
take fate into our own hands.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.518
Does that make any sense?

22:32.559 --> 22:33.769
If you say so.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.064
- Goodnight, sweetie.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.064
- Goodnight, daddy.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.774
Get in bed. I'll be right up.

22:47.283 --> 22:48.659
Alright.

22:47.283 --> 22:48.659
It's just you and me.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.913
Okay, if I take Bernadette

22:49.994 --> 22:52.913
out rollerblading

22:52.955 --> 22:55.373
on our second date..

22:55.415 --> 22:56.917
Am I gonna stay

22:55.415 --> 22:56.917
on my feet this time?

22:58.794 --> 23:00.713
I saw that, daddy.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.841
Sweetheart,

23:02.422 --> 23:03.841
I was just-I was just

23:03.883 --> 23:06.426
I'm just buffing up

23:03.883 --> 23:06.426
the old magic cue ball.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.095
Yeah, right.
