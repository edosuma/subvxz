WEBVTT

01:17.661 --> 01:19.287
You gotta help me!

01:35.304 --> 01:38.598
Emma! My sister! My sister!

01:38.682 --> 01:41.517
Emma! Emma!

02:02.206 --> 02:04.123
I'll be right back.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.544
- She's not breathing.
- Watch out.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.012
Come with me.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.898
Don't worry, she will be fine.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.454
Good. Let it out. You OK?

02:45.290 --> 02:48.125
Where's my mom?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.504
I don't know.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.465
She's meeting us in Los Angeles.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.592
Pam!

02:56.677 --> 02:59.804
Pam! Anybody seen my wife?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.141
We're not there yet.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.815
I promise,
we're gonna get you home soon, OK?

03:51.023 --> 03:52.982
Excuse me.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.863
Would you look after the children?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.992
There is something I have to do.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.957
OK.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.795
Stay with this nice woman.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.339
I'll be back in a minute.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.530
My leg! My leg!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.908
Is it bad? It's bad, isn't it?

04:43.992 --> 04:49.288
Nah, it's not that bad. I broke my leg
skiing up at Stowe, in Vermont.

04:49.373 --> 04:55.586
I was on this run, going pretty fast.
I was racing this cute ski patrol guy.

04:55.671 --> 04:59.632
I went off this mogul, lost my edge,
and... bam!

05:03.845 --> 05:06.973
Snapped my left leg.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.684
Now, that... that was bad.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.230
You a doctor?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.108
Year of med school before I dropped out.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.527
I'm a clinical psychologist.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.825
You saved that girl's life.
You a doctor?

05:27.786 --> 05:28.995
No.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.162
Help!

05:30.247 --> 05:32.957
Hey! I need some help!

05:33.041 --> 05:36.210
There's someone in the jungle!
He's alive!

05:37.963 --> 05:41.507
Help! Help me!

05:41.591 --> 05:44.093
Please, help me!

05:47.264 --> 05:53.477
Help!

05:55.188 --> 05:57.273
- We should climb up...
- No, wait...

05:57.357 --> 05:59.442
What's your name?

06:01.862 --> 06:05.322
- Bernard!
- You're gonna be all right, Bernard.

06:05.407 --> 06:10.411
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt
and grab the branch next to you.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.791
Is he dead? I think he's dead!

06:15.876 --> 06:19.170
- Maybe we should climb up.
- No. I need you to focus, Bernard.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.547
Unbuckle your seat belt.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.766
Now, grab the branch next to you.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.689
- I don't think I can do that.
- Bernard, those seats are gonna fall.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.833
Come on, you can do it.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.753
Bernard!

07:09.763 --> 07:12.431
All right, hold on tight, OK?

07:12.516 --> 07:14.600
I'm coming up to get you.

07:28.115 --> 07:32.034
- Does anybody have any water?
- No. Not here.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.749
Couldn't find any matches?

07:38.834 --> 07:43.129
Dry ones? You can ask around,
but I couldn't find any.

07:43.213 --> 07:47.675
It's gonna be dark soon. Gonna get a
signal fire started so they can find us.

07:48.593 --> 07:52.263
- What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Grown-up version.

07:52.347 --> 07:56.392
- I'm with the Peace Corps.
- They still have that?

07:57.144 --> 08:00.896
I'm just happy somebody your age
actually knows what it is.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.988
- What's your name?
- Goodwin.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.699
I'm Ana Lucia.

08:42.898 --> 08:49.737
I heard that you were the one who
pulled the dead bodies out of the water.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.490
Yes.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.787
Were any of them African-American?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.498
No.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.588
It's my wife.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.092
I can't find her.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.305
I will pray for her.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.728
Where the hell are the rescue planes?

09:24.898 --> 09:27.316
I will pray for them, too.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.145
What was that?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.859
Libby, watch the kids.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.529
Over here.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.658
It's all right. We'll be OK.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.505
What happened?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.493
No wallets...

11:01.578 --> 11:04.788
...no cell phone...

11:04.873 --> 11:06.832
...no keys, nothing.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.920
Hey.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.469
Are you OK?

11:20.847 --> 11:24.683
Hey!
Look, three other people are missing.

11:24.768 --> 11:28.812
The blonde guy, the curly haired guy,
and the German who was helping us.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.857
Did you see where they came from?
How many there were?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.609
No, I didn't see anything.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.696
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

11:37.781 --> 11:40.532
But they're out here in the jungle
with no shoes,

11:40.617 --> 11:44.244
nothing in their pockets,
no labels on their clothes.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.540
These people were here before us.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.547
We need to get off the beach.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.884
We need to find a safer place.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.887
We've got kids
and people who are seriously hurt.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.972
Where are we gonna go?

12:04.057 --> 12:07.810
How are we gonna move them?
What about the signal fire?

12:07.894 --> 12:11.814
How are we all gonna get rescued
if we're off the beach?

12:11.898 --> 12:16.735
- Nathan's right.
- They have satellites. The black box.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.196
We don't need a fire
for them to find us.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.323
Yes, we do.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.955
Before the crash,
the pilot said we'd lost communication.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.873
We were turning back.

12:29.958 --> 12:33.252
We were flying for two hours
in the wrong direction.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.505
They don't know where to look.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.621
It's Donald.

13:09.706 --> 13:13.083
His leg...
the infection is getting worse.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.335
He'll be the fourth to go.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.133
What are we supposed to do about that?

14:06.262 --> 14:09.348
No, come here! Come on!
Grab it! Grab it! Over here!

14:09.432 --> 14:11.433
Come on! Over here!

14:16.314 --> 14:19.233
I got it! I got it! Oh, no!
I got it! All right...

14:19.317 --> 14:21.610
I got it! I got it! I got it...

14:45.802 --> 14:48.053
Would you like some chicken?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.521
You haven't said a word in a week.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.775
Why aren't you talking?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.074
Hey.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.410
It wasn't your fault, you know.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.081
You were just defending yourself.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.479
- That'll work.
- Yeah...

15:39.564 --> 15:41.898
I heard a pig or something out there.

15:41.983 --> 15:45.068
Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.992
Give it to me.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.704
What?

15:58.833 --> 16:01.293
Where were you?

16:01.377 --> 16:03.545
I had to go to the bathroom.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.464
We have a system for that.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.633
We go in pairs.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.303
Yeah, sorry.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.975
Behind you! Behind you!

16:59.060 --> 17:02.521
- Help us! Please!
- The kids! They took the kids!

17:04.691 --> 17:06.608
Stop!

17:16.743 --> 17:20.747
I can't find them!
And they took Jim and Eli!

17:20.832 --> 17:23.165
- Nancy's gone!
- They're gone.

17:23.251 --> 17:28.338
Which way did they go?

17:30.091 --> 17:33.552
Wake up! Wake up! Who are you?

17:33.636 --> 17:38.682
- Talk to me! Wake up!
- She's dead! She's dead.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.440
What are you doing?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.611
Is that a knife?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.286
What is that?

18:05.835 --> 18:08.128
It's a list.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.549
A list of what?

18:12.633 --> 18:15.552
Nine... of us.

18:26.481 --> 18:29.191
Nothing?

18:29.275 --> 18:34.070
They drag nine people
into the jungle, the kids...

18:34.155 --> 18:36.364
...and there's no sign of them?

18:40.203 --> 18:42.537
Now's not a good time to talk?

18:46.542 --> 18:50.128
What needs to happen
to make you say something?

18:50.213 --> 18:52.631
Hey! Calm down, let's figure this out.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.884
"Calm down, let's figure this out?"

18:55.968 --> 19:00.555
Here are the names of every single
person they took, all nine of them.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.225
What they were wearing,
what they look like.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.436
One of them had a list of us.

19:06.521 --> 19:09.314
They coulda got our names
from the people they took.

19:09.398 --> 19:14.069
- Nobody knew any names the first night.
- Maybe they're watching us.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.697
You were gone for two hours yesterday.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.408
- What?
- Where were you?

19:20.493 --> 19:24.120
- I was going to the bathroom.
- Hey, stop!

19:24.205 --> 19:26.832
We're all scared.

19:26.916 --> 19:31.002
Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know anything.

19:31.087 --> 19:37.175
He's right. Why would they try to
infiltrate us? Now, that's crazy.

19:37.260 --> 19:41.263
Well, whoever they are, they know we
are here. We need to leave this beach.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.685
You said we needed
to keep the signal fire burning.

19:48.271 --> 19:51.273
I think it's time we let it go out.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.648
Five minutes.

20:36.986 --> 20:41.740
- We've been walking for three days.
- And you're still here. Five minutes.

20:41.824 --> 20:45.035
Know what?
You all wanna keep walking, go ahead.

20:45.119 --> 20:48.538
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs,
lots of fruit trees,

20:48.623 --> 20:51.458
right here looks pretty good to me.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.260
Fine. OK.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.015
This'll work.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.069
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:22.031 --> 21:26.701
Back at the beach,
the night they came back,

21:26.786 --> 21:31.873
you said that Nathan was gone
for two hours, that he was missing.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.835
He creeps me out, Ana.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.425
You really think it's possible
that one of us is...

21:44.470 --> 21:46.429
...one of them?

21:46.514 --> 21:49.307
Why do you think I'm digging this hole?

21:57.400 --> 22:01.569
- We gonna catch rabbits with this?
- Hell, yeah. Give me another stick.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.119
Hey, Ana.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.122
Ana!

22:22.091 --> 22:25.635
- What are you doing?
- You and I are gonna have a talk.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.807
You let me out of here right now!
You let me out!

22:30.891 --> 22:33.143
You let me out, or I'll...

22:33.227 --> 22:36.187
- I didn't do anything, Ana!
- He wasn't on the plane.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.273
- What?
- We were in the air two hours.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.358
I didn't see him once. Not once.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.986
- It's a big plane.
- I didn't see him either.

22:43.070 --> 22:47.073
I'm pretty good with faces,
of the passengers. I did not see him.

22:47.158 --> 22:50.702
- You're not all serious.
- He never talks about himself. Nathan.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.705
Every time I ask him anything,
he just dodges.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.624
If he were one of them,
why would he still be here?

22:56.709 --> 22:59.252
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

23:00.129 --> 23:03.965
Will you let me out? Ana?

23:06.260 --> 23:08.511
- You got a problem with this?
- Let me out!

23:08.596 --> 23:11.181
I didn't do anything.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.060
Let me out!

23:36.582 --> 23:42.670
Where are the kids?

23:47.218 --> 23:49.344
Where you from, Nathan?

23:51.972 --> 23:54.516
- Canada.
- What were you doing in Australia?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.684
- Company retreat.
- Where are they?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.978
- What?
- The rest of your retreat.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.648
- Where are they?
- They weren't on the plane.

24:01.732 --> 24:06.361
- I stayed extra days to sightsee.
- How come nobody saw you on the plane?

24:06.445 --> 24:09.114
- I was in the lavatory.
- For two hours?

24:09.198 --> 24:11.282
I don't remember seeing you.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.284
That's because you weren't on it.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.126
Where are the kids, Nathan?

24:26.924 --> 24:29.008
Where are the kids?

24:31.428 --> 24:34.013
You're not talking to me anymore?

24:40.187 --> 24:42.605
What's that behind you?

24:44.441 --> 24:46.317
Get up.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.573
I said, get up!

24:56.078 --> 24:57.829
- Who gave him food?
- What?

24:57.913 --> 24:59.831
I'm trying to find out what they did,

24:59.915 --> 25:03.293
- and you're taking care of him.
- I didn't do anything.

25:03.377 --> 25:07.172
And what if you're wrong, Ana?
We don't even know that there is spy.

25:07.256 --> 25:11.593
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach
where they could pick us off one by one?

25:11.677 --> 25:13.511
His. Nathan's.

25:13.596 --> 25:16.431
Well, they haven't come
since we put him in there.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.433
Who did it?

25:23.939 --> 25:25.899
You?

25:58.849 --> 26:01.392
I'm worried about you, Ana.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.187
You've had him down there four days.

26:07.316 --> 26:11.569
I promised that little girl that
I would get her back home to her mom.

26:19.036 --> 26:21.162
Do you have any kids, Ana?

26:26.001 --> 26:27.669
No.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.763
We should let him go.

26:40.391 --> 26:43.184
We're not savages.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.562
If I were a savage
I would have cut off his finger already.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.817
That's tomorrow.

27:20.514 --> 27:23.725
Grab the rope. I'll pull you up.

27:35.529 --> 27:40.491
Ana Lucia's... I think...
We all think she's gonna hurt you.

27:40.576 --> 27:43.494
You need to get away from here.

27:43.579 --> 27:46.080
There's some fruit in there,
now just go.

27:47.583 --> 27:51.753
- Which way's the beach?
- That way, maybe five miles.

28:18.238 --> 28:25.411
Morning.

28:28.415 --> 28:33.711
- Ana Lucia! He's gone!
- What?

28:33.796 --> 28:35.963
He's gone! Nathan's gone!

28:42.179 --> 28:45.973
- Ana, what are you gonna do?
- They found us, it's time to move.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.975
What is it?

29:29.059 --> 29:30.601
I don't know.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.271
Some sort of bunker.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.731
Do you think it's theirs?

29:39.528 --> 29:41.779
What are you doing?

30:09.892 --> 30:11.976
What is this place?

30:12.060 --> 30:14.395
Looks like
some sort of storage facility.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.825
Hey, come over here.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.046
What was that? Get it.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.092
What else is in here?

30:47.262 --> 30:49.597
It's a glass eye.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.986
Look at this.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.283
It's a radio.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.800
Hello?

31:26.635 --> 31:29.095
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

31:31.139 --> 31:35.768
The hills are blocking it. If we want a
signal, we need to get to higher ground.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.397
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.

31:39.481 --> 31:40.815
No, you stay here.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.985
- Get this place set up as a shelter.
- We can all set it up.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.279
We can make it back
in a couple of hours.

31:46.363 --> 31:48.239
Let's go.

31:54.830 --> 32:00.126
- Why do you think they're doing this?
- Why do I think who's doing what?

32:00.210 --> 32:05.590
Them. Don't you ever wonder
why they attack us?

32:05.674 --> 32:09.176
Maybe they're not attacking us.

32:10.804 --> 32:15.516
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle
every now and then.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.060
No real harm done.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.521
Good point.

32:24.192 --> 32:28.029
Why do you think they take some of us
and not the others?

32:29.448 --> 32:32.241
That first night
they took the strongest of us,

32:32.326 --> 32:35.202
our quiet friend, three other guys.

32:36.246 --> 32:42.752
They're all athletic...
tough... threats.

32:42.836 --> 32:45.296
They didn't take you.

32:49.134 --> 32:53.095
Guess they changed their plan
after two of them got killed.

32:56.725 --> 33:00.645
- Wanna take a break?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.871
Can I have the knife?

33:40.769 --> 33:42.436
Thank you.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.401
Where do you think they got it?

33:48.485 --> 33:50.778
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.531
How did they get an army knife?

33:54.783 --> 33:59.370
- Sorry?
- The knife. It's US military.

34:03.834 --> 34:04.917
Here...

34:07.337 --> 34:09.130
I'll show you.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.094
You see the tang stamp?

34:17.304 --> 34:19.223
This knife's probably 20 years old.

34:19.306 --> 34:22.016
You don't see these anymore.

34:22.101 --> 34:26.313
Yet, here it is, on this island.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.025
Weird, huh?

34:33.321 --> 34:35.614
Can I ask you something?

34:37.159 --> 34:39.326
Sure, Ana.

34:39.411 --> 34:43.080
When you ran out of the jungle,
the day of the crash...

34:44.958 --> 34:48.085
how did you find Bernard
up in the tree?

34:50.505 --> 34:53.047
I heard him shouting from the beach.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.012
From the beach?

35:01.057 --> 35:03.726
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?

35:07.189 --> 35:09.690
Did he see you out there?

35:11.318 --> 35:14.987
Is that why you pretended
to be one of us?

35:19.409 --> 35:23.537
You ran out of the jungle
ten minutes after the crash.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.331
You weren't wet.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.171
You were never even in the ocean.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.975
Where are they?

35:45.060 --> 35:47.186
Your friends?

35:49.773 --> 35:52.983
Nathan... what did you...

35:53.068 --> 35:56.987
If you had cut off his finger and
he still told you he was on the plane,

35:57.072 --> 36:01.283
I think maybe you would have started
to believe you had the wrong guy.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.828
Did you kill him?

36:03.912 --> 36:06.413
Nathan was not a good person.

36:09.084 --> 36:11.418
That's why he wasn't on the list.

36:20.303 --> 36:23.556
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.766
The children are fine.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.565
They're better off now.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.987
Where's Goodwin?

37:24.284 --> 37:26.535
We're safe here now.

37:50.685 --> 37:54.313
Why are you wasting your time
with that thing? There's no signal.

37:54.397 --> 37:59.735
I only turn it on a couple minutes
a day. It really doesn't...

37:59.861 --> 38:03.781
Hello? Hello? Anybody out there?
Mayday! Mayday!

38:05.659 --> 38:08.494
- Is there someone there?
- Hello! Hello!

38:09.871 --> 38:12.164
- Who is that?
- Can you hear me?

38:12.248 --> 38:14.208
Repeat your transmission.

38:14.334 --> 38:19.421
Hello! We're survivors of the crash
of Oceanic flight 815, please copy!

38:19.506 --> 38:23.717
We're the survivors of flight 815!
No, wait a minute, what are you doing?

38:23.802 --> 38:31.016
It's them.

38:32.769 --> 38:36.605
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.649
No, he said "flight 815".

38:38.733 --> 38:42.820
They know our flight number because
Goodwin knew our flight number.

38:44.572 --> 38:48.117
- What if there are survivors out there?
- There are no survivors.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.666
This is our life now.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.710
Get used to it.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.638
What are you looking at?

39:56.519 --> 39:58.771
It's going to be OK.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.750
What, you're talking now?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.253
It's been 40 days.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.808
You been waiting 40 days to talk?

40:38.186 --> 40:40.687
You waited 40 days to cry.

41:28.736 --> 41:29.903
Libby.

41:40.290 --> 41:43.125
- Turn him over.
- Is he alive?

41:47.422 --> 41:49.590
Get Ana Lucia! Quick!

42:01.728 --> 42:03.812
Who are you?

42:06.524 --> 42:08.859
Where are you from?

42:18.453 --> 42:21.663
- He doesn't speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.

42:21.748 --> 42:25.417
- We found him in the water.
- He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.

42:27.754 --> 42:29.671
I'm not sure that he's a threat.

42:33.635 --> 42:34.760
He's running!

42:38.139 --> 42:41.308
- Michael! Sawyer!
- Jin!

42:42.268 --> 42:44.811
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

42:44.896 --> 42:49.233
Others! Others! Others! Others!
Others...

42:49.317 --> 42:50.692
Others...

43:11.089 --> 43:13.507
- Hit me.
- Hit you?

43:13.591 --> 43:16.593
You think they're OK?

43:16.678 --> 43:18.428
Let's find out.

43:18.513 --> 43:19.972
Hit me.

44:34.213 --> 44:36.089
- Cindy?
- Did they take her?

44:36.174 --> 44:37.924
Cindy!

45:00.782 --> 45:02.616
What was that?
