"eva knew this might be

00:34.402 --> 00:37.472
The last time
She saw him...

00:37.471 --> 00:39.671
The last time she saw

00:39.673 --> 00:41.873
The man
Who had stolen her heart."

00:42.809 --> 00:44.639
[sighs]

00:47.947 --> 00:50.477
Oh, eva,
You're killing me.

00:53.486 --> 00:55.516
[phone buzzes]

01:01.728 --> 01:03.798
[♪♪]

01:05.364 --> 01:06.395
Ah! Gabriel august.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.130
I've already
Pre-ordered my copy.

01:08.135 --> 01:09.465
I know! I set aside
That whole weekend

01:09.470 --> 01:10.870
Just to read it.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.601
I'm almost as excited
About the new book

01:12.606 --> 01:14.606
As i am about
Seeing his face.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.178
I bet
He's so handsome.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.848
[they sigh]

01:23.216 --> 01:24.746
I can't do it.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.122
I can't let the world know
That i'm gabriel august.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.121
It's part of
The deal, liam.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.622
You knew that
When you signed.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.923
Yeah, but i never thought
The first book

01:30.925 --> 01:32.285
Would actually be
Successful.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.663
[laughs] i did!

01:33.661 --> 01:35.091
Didn't i tell you it
Would be a best-seller?

01:35.096 --> 01:37.396
I just assumed you were
Being nice.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.258
I've known you
Since you were born.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.666
I don't need to make nice.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.698
You can't stay
Anonymous forever.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.403
Readers form connections
With the books they love.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.336
They want a relationship
With the author.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.412
You're a success, liam!

01:49.410 --> 01:52.610
Why can't you embrace it?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.713
The manuscript
For your next book is due,

01:54.715 --> 01:57.145
And i haven't seen
Any chapters.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.621
Oh...

01:58.619 --> 02:00.889
I've written plenty of
Chapters,
And then...

02:00.888 --> 02:02.888
Promptly
Thrown them in the trash.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.390
Well,

02:04.391 --> 02:08.091
You are gonna have to find
The inspiration somewhere,

02:08.095 --> 02:10.895
Because you still owe
Harris-kingsfield two books.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.558
You're sure there's no way
We can just get 'em

02:12.566 --> 02:15.226
To postpone the whole
Gabriel august reveal?

02:15.236 --> 02:17.636
It's been almost impossible
Holding them off this long.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.738
It's time.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.469
Why don't you go
Up to the cabin

02:20.474 --> 02:22.014
In portland
For a couple of weeks?

02:22.009 --> 02:24.479
And i'll see if i can
Get the reveal moved out
There.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.908
You wrote first star of
Evening
There in less than a month.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.254
I wrote it as a joke.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.179
You wrote it because
Katherine broke your heart.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.154
Portland has always been
A great place

02:32.153 --> 02:33.693
For you to get
Your center again.

02:33.687 --> 02:34.987
Just like it was
For your parents.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.289
I remember when
Your mom told me

02:36.290 --> 02:38.320
They were buying
A place up there.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.485
I thought they were crazy.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.163
So far from everything.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.603
But it became
Their little hideaway.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.427
Get out of town for a while.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.132
Clear your head.

02:47.134 --> 02:51.444
And get ready for
The best chapter of your
Life.

02:51.438 --> 02:55.838
The next one
Is gonna be a great one.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.413
[announcement]: this will
Serve
As the final boarding call

02:57.411 --> 02:59.081
For flight 782 to denver,

02:59.079 --> 03:01.549
And continuing on
To portland.

03:04.584 --> 03:05.854
[breathless woman]:
I'm here!

03:05.853 --> 03:07.123
-welcome aboard.
-sorry.

03:07.121 --> 03:09.151
[attendant]: here,
I'll take your bag.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.316
[woman]: that cab driver
Dropped
Me off at the wrong
Terminal.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.664
I can barely walk in heels,
Much less run.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.690
[attendant]: 1-c,
Right up here in first
Class.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.355
[woman]: are you sure?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.663
[attendant]:
Your upgrade went through.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.196
[woman]: you're kidding.
That never happens.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.472
[attendant]:
Must be your lucky day.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.099
[woman]: thank you.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.036
-hi.
-hello.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.912
[relieved sigh]

03:29.910 --> 03:31.780
First class.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.179
I feel so special.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.380
They'll even bring you
A glass of champagne,

03:35.382 --> 03:36.822
If you want.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.287
No. No.
I... I shouldn't.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.747
Well, maybe just one.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.655
But i have
Lots of work to do,

03:43.657 --> 03:44.987
So i won't--
Don't worry,

03:44.992 --> 03:47.992
I won't be talking your
Ear off the whole time.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.155
Do you live
In new york?

03:49.163 --> 03:52.233
No, i'm heading home.
Portland.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.133
I was just in the city
For a couple of job
Interviews.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.635
Ah. I hope they went well.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.837
We'll see.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.198
Everybody was really nice.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.406
Maybe too nice.

04:01.408 --> 04:05.678
I... It's just so hard to
Know
What people are really
Thinking.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.849
I wish they would just
Say what they mean.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.278
Things would be
So much easier that way.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.354
Not always.
Sometimes the truth hurts.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.723
Hurts a lot less than lies.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.721
Sounds like the voice
Of experience talking.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.264
That obvious?

04:19.260 --> 04:20.290
[chuckles]

04:20.293 --> 04:21.334
Champagne?

04:21.327 --> 04:23.798
Two.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.827
Definitely.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.596
To a great flight.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.642
With lots of
Fabulous legroom.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.499
You seem very focused.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.058
Is it good?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.696
It wants to be.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.402
If that makes any sense.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.844
The new
Gabriel august?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.508
Thought that book
Wasn't out.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.337
Mm. I got
An advance copy.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.512
You read
Gabriel august?

05:10.511 --> 05:12.111
[laughs]

05:12.112 --> 05:14.282
No, but
I've heard of him.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.521
Yeah, you don't...
You don't really seem

05:16.517 --> 05:18.317
Like his typical
Demographic.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.189
So you don't like this one?

05:20.187 --> 05:22.087
No. I... I do.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.819
It's just his first book,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.285
First star of evening,

05:26.293 --> 05:27.933
Was so good.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.328
Really?

05:29.330 --> 05:32.630
I-- i think the first novel
Was such a success

05:32.633 --> 05:35.673
Because it was just so
Honest.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.439
You really felt like
You knew those characters.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.339
Sounds like
I should give it a read.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.641
Absolutely.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.712
Just... Maybe skip this one.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.182
It's a little
Disappointing.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.380
It doesn't feel real.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.711
It's like...

05:48.716 --> 05:51.346
He took the first book
And stuck it in a blender

05:51.352 --> 05:53.392
And mixed it up and
Put a new title on it.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.287
Oh! That's harsh.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.889
I guess.

05:57.891 --> 06:01.361
I hate to see such potential
Go to waste.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.232
Have you heard about this?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.660
He has this whole
Marketing gimmick.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.465
He's very mysterious.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.027
It's a little ridiculous.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.065
You think it's a gimmick?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.339
What else could it be?

06:10.337 --> 06:11.597
I'm sure he has his reasons.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.165
Whatever it is,
I guess it's working,

06:14.174 --> 06:17.084
Because along with
Every other woman in
America,

06:17.077 --> 06:21.507
I am actually curious
To find out who he really
Is.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.445
[announcement]:
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:23.450 --> 06:25.750
The captain has begun
Our descent into portland,

06:25.753 --> 06:27.323
And we'll be landing
Shortly.

06:27.321 --> 06:28.391
[sighs]

06:28.389 --> 06:30.219
Well...

06:30.224 --> 06:33.494
This has ruined me.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.264
I don't think
I can go back to coach.

06:41.868 --> 06:44.338
I'm going to finish.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.780

06:53.781 --> 06:54.711
Hey!

06:54.715 --> 06:56.075
Hey there.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.583
You look like
You're in a hurry.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.256
Staff meeting at work.
I'm barely gonna make it.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.487
Do you want me
To help you with your bag?

07:05.492 --> 07:07.462
Looks like you're the one
That could use the help.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.761
Oh...

07:08.762 --> 07:11.132
Sorry. I gotta run.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.961
It was really nice
Meeting you.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.026
Yeah. You too.

[♪♪]

07:37.423 --> 07:40.233

07:40.227 --> 07:41.487
It's not usually
So jammed up

07:41.495 --> 07:43.055
At the taxi line.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.133
Just my luck.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.961
My boss'll kill me
If i'm late again.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.826
I'm happy
To give you a lift.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.536
My mom always told me

07:50.537 --> 07:52.097
Never to accept
Rides in limos

07:52.105 --> 07:54.035
From strangers
I met on airplanes.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.711
Your mom gave you
Very specific advice.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.778
Come on. It's got just
As much legroom as first
Class.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.353
We can even
Split the tip,

08:04.351 --> 08:05.481
If that makes you feel
Better.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.386
I don't even
Know your name.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.287
Liam.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.348
Sophie.

08:11.457 --> 08:14.487
Well, i guess
We aren't strangers anymore.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.325
[♪♪]

08:29.942 --> 08:31.212
So...

08:31.211 --> 08:32.341
You said
You live in new york?

08:32.346 --> 08:33.576
Mostly.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.350
I like spending time
In portland, though.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.519
I love it here.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.548
What do you do?

08:38.552 --> 08:40.121
Um...

08:40.120 --> 08:41.720
Freelance
Project consulting.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.155

Any plans for tonight?

08:45.158 --> 08:46.488
Uh... [laughs]

08:46.493 --> 08:48.563
Actually, i do.

08:48.562 --> 08:52.062
My two best friends have
Their engagement party.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.725
Well, they were
Just friends for years.

08:54.735 --> 08:58.195
This whole falling-in-love
Thing
Has kind of came out of
Nowhere.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.335
It's taken
A little getting used to.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.071
But it's a good thing?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.535
It's a great thing!

09:03.544 --> 09:05.214
[horn honks]

09:13.252 --> 09:15.652
Looks like the street's
Blocked ahead.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.216
I can't be any later.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.134
The office is only
A couple of blocks away.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.987
I-i think i'm gonna
Hoof it from here.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.325
Oh. Right, okay.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.560
Well, if you ever w...

09:25.566 --> 09:27.896
Right! We were
Gonna split the tip.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.271
Oh, stop. Stop, stop.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.539
Stop.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.813
Okay, my friends
Are never gonna believe

09:36.810 --> 09:39.980
That i got to fly in first
Class
And ride in a limo

09:39.980 --> 09:41.810
On the same day.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.245
Do you mind if i take a
Picture?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.280

11:09.403 --> 11:11.203
Actually, pretty good.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.474
The job interviews
Went well?

11:13.473 --> 11:16.043
A couple of the magazines
Were interested.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.343
I'm just not sure
I want to move to new york.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.905
You may not have a choice.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.015
I don't know how long
This paper's gonna survive.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.617
Really? What's going on?

11:25.619 --> 11:27.389
Berkmann fired
Four more staffers

11:27.387 --> 11:29.587
While you were gone.

11:34.727 --> 11:38.227
He keeps getting worse
Instead of better.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.731
[♪♪]

12:03.489 --> 12:17.239
[♪♪]

12:17.237 --> 12:21.907
[keys clicking]

12:25.511 --> 12:27.851
Sophie, who are you?

12:38.124 --> 12:39.564
He's cute!

12:39.559 --> 12:41.889
Not as cute as you,
Of course,

12:41.895 --> 12:44.055
But he's definitely hot.
Who is he?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.734
We sat next to each other
On the plane,

12:45.732 --> 12:47.972
And then he ended up
Giving me a ride.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.268
In a limo.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.399
I can't believe
You rode in a car

12:50.403 --> 12:51.573
With a guy
You just met.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.811
He was in first class.
How dangerous could he be?

12:53.807 --> 12:56.067
So when are you
Gonna see him again?

12:56.076 --> 12:57.076
It wasn't like that.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.377
I don't even
Have his number.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.709
Why not?

13:00.714 --> 13:02.484
Are you not into
Hot guys anymore?

13:02.482 --> 13:03.622
Okay.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.447
It's nice if a guy
Isn't too hard on the eyes,

13:06.453 --> 13:08.523
But that kind of thing
Being really important?

13:08.522 --> 13:09.752
Never again.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.286
I wonder why
Was he in a limo.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.761
You think he's famous,
Or just rich?

13:13.760 --> 13:16.030
Neither.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.459
He was some kind
Of consultant.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.134
He's...he's just
A regular guy.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.003
Hey, man.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.372
You want to play
Man coverage on the
Outside?

13:23.370 --> 13:25.000
Fine by me!

13:25.005 --> 13:26.805
Just don't be surprised
If i shred the secondary.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.107
Harris?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.678
You mind changing
That channel?

13:32.611 --> 13:34.911
[♪♪]

13:34.915 --> 13:37.545
Heads up, st. Louis!
You're next!

13:37.551 --> 13:39.481
Come next sunday,
We own you.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.916
There we go, eh, baby?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.721
[harris]: good riddance.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.763
You were too good
For that low-life anyway.

13:44.758 --> 13:46.258
You okay?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.389
Sure.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.064
I love seeing my ex
On tv screens

13:50.063 --> 13:52.333
Everywhere i go.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.632
I also love

13:53.633 --> 13:56.433
Having the whole world know
That he cheated on me.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.636
But the thing
That's so annoying

13:58.638 --> 13:59.898
Is that i had no idea.

13:59.906 --> 14:02.866
I mean,
How could i have had no
Clue?

14:02.876 --> 14:05.006
He was a sneaky rat,
That's why.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.581
So what am i supposed to do?

14:06.580 --> 14:09.750
Just assume that every guy
I meet is lying to me?

14:09.749 --> 14:10.879
Not every guy,

14:10.884 --> 14:12.524
Just most of them.

14:12.519 --> 14:16.519
You just gotta wait till
The right one comes along.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.323
Trust me, you'll meet
Someone much better.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.586
Maybe
She already has.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.334
"limo guy"
Sounds interesting.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.659
Honey, that--
That's a terrible idea.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.904
She's just been
Through a big break-up,

14:26.900 --> 14:28.330
A public break-up.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.395
She should just
Take her time.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.843
No! No way.
Sophie needs to get

14:31.838 --> 14:33.098
Right back out there
And start dating.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.006
-no, she doesn't.
-yes, she does.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.808
Okay. Will you two stop?

14:36.810 --> 14:37.680
I will be fine.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.837
I would've preferred
Not to have

14:39.846 --> 14:41.376
The whole world read

14:41.381 --> 14:42.481
About my love life

14:42.482 --> 14:46.582
On practically every
Gossip website, but...

14:46.586 --> 14:50.356
That's what you get
When you date a famous
Person.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.217
I promise you, though,

14:52.225 --> 14:54.225
I'm totally fine.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.027
"totally fine"?

14:57.596 --> 15:00.366
Well...

15:00.367 --> 15:02.367
I'm getting there.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.039
It's only been a few days.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.737
I'm really starting
To get into it, though,

15:05.739 --> 15:07.309
Get that old
"gabriel august" engine

15:07.307 --> 15:09.067
Revved up
And racing again.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.575
So it's going well?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.637
Absolutely. Portland
Was a great idea.

15:12.646 --> 15:13.746
Good.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.707
I was starting
To worry about you.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.576
You haven't written a thing,
Have you?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.516
Why do you think that?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.861
Because you sound
Way too relaxed.

15:23.857 --> 15:25.617
Maybe you should
Shake things up a little,

15:25.625 --> 15:26.585
Go out with friends,

15:26.593 --> 15:29.063
Or on a date or something.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.332
Well, i did meet a nice
Woman
On the plane.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.261
Perfect!
Call her up.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.466
I don't know her last name,

15:34.467 --> 15:35.997
And i have no idea
Where to find her.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.242
Can't ever just do anything
The easy way, can you?

15:39.239 --> 15:40.839
Oh!

15:40.840 --> 15:43.470
I changed
The gabriel august reveal

15:43.476 --> 15:45.536
To jasper's bookloft
Out there in portland,

15:45.545 --> 15:47.805
So you won't have to fly
Back to new york for it.

15:47.814 --> 15:48.984
So this is really happening?

15:50.916 --> 15:52.716
It'll be liam and jackie,
Just like always.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.249
But i'll be the one up there
In front of all those
People.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.615
I know
It's gonna be hard

15:56.623 --> 15:58.163
For you to let go of

15:58.158 --> 15:59.618
This gabriel august
Mystique,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.656
But you can't keep
Leading two lives like this.

16:01.661 --> 16:05.301
This is a good thing.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.228
Have i ever steered
You wrong before?

16:07.233 --> 16:09.033
Is that a trick question?

16:09.035 --> 16:11.095
I'll call you
When i get out there,

16:11.104 --> 16:13.814
And you can show me
Your town, mr. Portland.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.007
Is it a date?

16:15.008 --> 16:16.338
Yeah. It's a date.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.213
-bye.
-bye.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.680
Well,
As you've probably guessed,

16:26.686 --> 16:29.386
We got our new numbers back,
And they're not pretty.

16:29.389 --> 16:33.219
Circulation is down 23%
From the same time last
Year.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.986
So, going forward,
I have it from on high

16:35.996 --> 16:37.896
That we need to spice things
Up.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.927
I need your pieces
To jump off the page.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.203
Get noticed.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.431
If you want to do
A feel-good fluff piece

16:43.436 --> 16:44.596
On a pee-wee baseball team,

16:44.604 --> 16:46.504
Scrap it and find out

16:46.506 --> 16:47.766
When the trail blazers
Are firing their coach.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.944
They want us to make noise,

16:50.944 --> 16:53.184
Get retweeted or facebooked,

16:53.179 --> 16:55.509
Or whatever
The kids are doing these
Days.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.075
Books, movies,
Restaurant reviews--

16:58.084 --> 16:59.654
Nothing's just "okay"
Anymore.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.092
They're either fantastic

17:02.088 --> 17:03.248
Or the worst thing
You've ever seen.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.386
I'm talking extreme
Opinions.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.761
But you don't want us

17:05.759 --> 17:07.829
To write reviews
We don't believe in, do you?

17:07.827 --> 17:09.527
Well, if that's what it
Takes,
Then yeah.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.459
It's how we generate
Web hits and subscriptions.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.934
Look, i don't love it,
But it's the hand we're
Dealt.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.334
All right, i'll have
New assignments

17:16.336 --> 17:17.965
For all of you in a few.

17:17.971 --> 17:19.300
Make me proud.

17:23.942 --> 17:25.112
Sophie.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.050
Got something for you
That might be interesting.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.247
After your little speech,
I'm almost afraid to ask.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.620
That review you're doing

17:31.618 --> 17:33.248
On gabriel august's
New book?

17:33.253 --> 17:35.193
I'm not gonna turn it
Into a hatchet piece

17:35.188 --> 17:36.688
Just to get more tweets.

17:36.689 --> 17:37.989
I've got something
Even better.

17:37.991 --> 17:40.431
I just found out that
Jasper's is hosting

17:40.427 --> 17:42.127
Gabriel august's
Little coming-out party

17:42.128 --> 17:43.158
Tomorrow night,

17:43.163 --> 17:44.233
Right here in portland.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.230
I want you to cover it.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.461
We'll run it with the
Review.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.626
Wait. He's revealing
His true identity here?

17:49.636 --> 17:51.266
Why portland?

17:51.271 --> 17:53.701
It's your job to find out.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.642
[♪♪]

18:08.821 --> 18:12.261
[hushed conversation]

18:12.258 --> 18:14.628
Deep breaths.
This is a good thing.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.657
Once this is over,

18:15.662 --> 18:17.302
You can stop
Leading two lives.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.527
I'll never just
Be liam bradley.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.861
All everyone
Will care about

18:19.866 --> 18:21.026
Is gabriel august.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.434
That's who i'll be from now
On.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.335
It's going to be okay.
I promise.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.937
And it's gonna feel so good

18:25.939 --> 18:27.739
To finally get this
Off your chest.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.010
Okay, i think it's time.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.078
We don't want to
Keep them waiting.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.837
I'm gonna go
And make the introduction.

18:32.846 --> 18:35.076
You wait here,
I point to you,

18:35.081 --> 18:36.611
And that's it...

18:36.616 --> 18:38.016
And the world
Meets gabriel august

18:38.017 --> 18:39.147
For the first time.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.592
Okay. I'm as ready as i can
Be.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.518
You're gonna be great.
They're gonna love you.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.917
You should take
That seat in the front.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.756
Got it.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.874
[jackie]:
If i can have your
Attention?

18:56.870 --> 18:58.170
I think you're all
About as excited

18:58.171 --> 18:59.601
To be here tonight
As i am.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.466
With millions of books

19:01.474 --> 19:03.574
Sold worldwide
Over the last three years,

19:03.576 --> 19:06.236
Gabriel august has touched
All our hearts.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.106
He has made us fall in love,
And he has made us cry.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.575
It's my pleasure
To introduce to you

19:11.584 --> 19:13.994
The man behind
These incredible stories.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.087
Ladies and gentlemen...

19:16.089 --> 19:17.959
Please allow me to introduce
You all

19:17.957 --> 19:19.957
To the writer
You've come to know

19:19.959 --> 19:22.729
As gabriel august.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.159
[applause]

19:33.739 --> 19:35.769
[applause tapers off]

19:42.881 --> 19:46.151
I had a feeling
I might find you here.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.752
This was always
Your favorite spot to write.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.785
I can't fool you, can i?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.720
No.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.425
And you'd best remember
That.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.657
Liam, what
Were you thinking?

19:56.663 --> 19:58.733
I was standing there
Like an idiot,

19:58.731 --> 20:00.061
Pointing at no one.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.126
I'm really sorry.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.704
I just... I panicked.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.402
Your publisher
Is furious.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.774
They're threatening

20:05.772 --> 20:07.242
To release your name and
Information themselves.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
Well, they can't
Do that!

20:08.241 --> 20:10.441
Well, they won't, not yet.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.813
I told them if they did,
We'd sue them,

20:12.812 --> 20:15.052
And we'd make
A big, ugly public
Spectacle.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.778
You must not be
Very popular over there.

20:17.784 --> 20:18.924
It's not my job
To be popular.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.748
It's my job to look
After my clients,

20:20.753 --> 20:22.553
Even the ones
That make me crazy.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.985
More bad news.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.160
Mm.

20:25.158 --> 20:27.928
One of the first reviews
For by the lighthouse.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.827
It's pretty
Disappointing.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.629
"tepid attempts
At conveying human
Emotion..."

20:36.468 --> 20:38.368
-it's her!
-who?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.711
Sophie. The girl from
The plane and limo ride.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.237
That's why she was
At the bookstore!

20:42.242 --> 20:43.672
To write about
Gabriel august.

20:43.676 --> 20:44.776
-this is incredible.

20:44.777 --> 20:45.777
Incredible?
I'd hate to hear

20:45.778 --> 20:47.078
What you think a bad
Review looks like.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.110
I gotta go!
We'll talk soon.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.414
Liam!

20:49.415 --> 20:50.575
I gotta find her.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.919
Liam!

20:55.922 --> 20:58.592
We still have to talk about
Rescheduling your reveal!

20:58.591 --> 21:00.291
I'll call you later!

21:00.293 --> 21:02.933
Li-- [frustrated sigh]

21:05.297 --> 21:07.697
[♪♪]

21:09.401 --> 21:11.001
Sorry.

21:11.004 --> 21:12.274
Liam?

21:12.272 --> 21:14.212
Sophie!

21:14.207 --> 21:17.307
Sorry. That--
That was totally my fault.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.640
No, no. It was all me.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.535
They need to pass a "no
Texting
While walking" bill,

21:20.546 --> 21:21.546
Like new york.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.177
They have those there?

21:24.049 --> 21:26.079
Right.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.845
So where're you heading
In such a rush?

21:27.854 --> 21:30.494
Home.
I just got off work.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.720
I write book reviews
For the portland record.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.225
Really?

21:34.227 --> 21:35.427
That sounds interesting.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.726
Look, i realize we just met,
You know, again,

21:40.733 --> 21:43.103
But maybe you'd like
To grab a bite to eat
Sometime?

21:43.102 --> 21:45.072
I--

21:45.071 --> 21:46.901
That's really nice,

21:46.906 --> 21:48.536
But i have a lot
Of work to do.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.911
Aw, come on!
You eat, i eat.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.039
Let's eat
At the same table.

21:52.045 --> 21:53.705
Persistent,
Aren't you?

21:53.713 --> 21:54.913
Well, i'm usually not,

21:54.914 --> 21:57.754
But it seems like
This might be worth it.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.780
One meal couldn't
Hurt, right?

22:00.686 --> 22:01.816
I suppose not.

22:01.821 --> 22:05.021
I think
I'll take that as a yes.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.394
[♪♪]

22:20.138 --> 22:22.438
[♪♪]

22:29.748 --> 22:31.978
[quiet shock]: no way....

22:39.324 --> 22:41.464
So you just ran into
Him on the street?

22:41.461 --> 22:43.131
That's, like, fate.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.629
Okay, don't
Get carried away.

22:47.132 --> 22:49.232
But here's
The interesting part.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.995
His parents

22:51.003 --> 22:52.373
Are devon hillman
And helen bradley.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.312
The movie stars?
You're kidding!

22:54.307 --> 22:55.607
-no.
-are you sure?

22:55.608 --> 22:58.178
I saw a picture
Of him with them.

22:58.177 --> 23:01.077
Well, that's why he rides
In limos and flies first
Class.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.910
His parents were
Celebrities.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.715
He was just 19 when
They died in that plane
Crash.

23:05.718 --> 23:06.718
That was so sad.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.919
It was awful.

23:09.922 --> 23:13.562
Do you think it's weird
That he didn't mention it?

23:13.559 --> 23:15.789
To hide something
So important?

23:15.795 --> 23:17.225
You hardly know him.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.360
Why would he tell you

23:18.364 --> 23:19.734
The most traumatic
Story of his life

23:19.732 --> 23:21.032
When you guys haven't even
Been on a date yet?

23:21.033 --> 23:22.533
[groans] i know.

23:22.535 --> 23:23.595
You're right.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.243
I mean, i'm just...

23:25.238 --> 23:27.268
You're being paranoid,
That's what.

23:27.273 --> 23:30.473
Not all guys are hiding
Things like james.

23:30.476 --> 23:31.876
You need to
Give liam a chance.

23:32.778 --> 23:34.038
Oh!

23:35.847 --> 23:38.577
Who's this liam?

23:38.584 --> 23:40.954
The guy that sophie's
Going on a date with.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.823
It-- it's not a date,
It's just dinner.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.023
Why are you holding back?

23:45.024 --> 23:47.224
You either like him,
Or you don't.

23:47.226 --> 23:50.326
I-i do like him.
I just...

23:50.329 --> 23:52.129
I wish i knew him better.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.031
Hello!
That's what a date's for.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.503
To get to know somebody.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.571
I thought i knew james.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.670
I never liked that one.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.471
That's right.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.143
You didn't.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.611
You guys knew
There was something wrong

24:03.609 --> 24:04.879
Before i did.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.777
That's how i'll know--
I'll introduce him to you,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.809
And you can tell me
What you think.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.775
You want us
To crash your date?

24:10.783 --> 24:12.183
Brilliant, right?

24:12.185 --> 24:14.645
Yeah. Let me
Check him out first.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.050
Thank you.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.156
[doorbell chimes]

24:24.863 --> 24:26.833
Just because you don't
Answer the phone

24:26.833 --> 24:28.503
Doesn't mean
I'm gonna go away.

24:28.501 --> 24:31.401
I honestly was not
Trying to avoid you.

24:31.404 --> 24:33.404
Okay, maybe i was, but not
For the reason you think.

24:33.406 --> 24:35.566
I was actually writing
Today.

24:35.575 --> 24:36.905
That's great.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.439
Well,
It wasn't great,

24:39.445 --> 24:42.205
But it was
Something, anyway.

24:42.215 --> 24:46.145
The words,
They are coming.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.522
I don't like them
Once they're on the page.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.791
So kind of less of
A writer's block issue,

24:49.789 --> 24:52.119
And more of
A heart-not-being-in-it
Issue?

24:52.124 --> 24:54.334
And don't you look dapper?

24:54.327 --> 24:55.557
Yeah.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.701
I found her. Sophie.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.797
We're going to dinner.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.769
You really like this girl,
Don't you?

25:01.767 --> 25:03.727
I haven't seen you
Like this in ages.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.096
Oh...

25:05.104 --> 25:07.004
You know, i felt something
When i met her.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.506
Something strange.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.868
She's not like other women.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.576
She's interesting
And...

25:12.578 --> 25:13.938
And unique.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.406
And she tells it
Like it is, right?

25:15.414 --> 25:16.914
How did you know that?

25:16.916 --> 25:19.176
I know you pretty well
After all these years,
Honey.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.615
I feel nervous around her,
But it's a good nervous.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.362
Yeah, i'd be
A bit nervous, too,

25:24.357 --> 25:26.687
If i was going out with
Somebody
Who hated my book so much.

25:31.663 --> 25:34.733
Ah. It really
Hasn't come up yet.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.774
I'm going to let you get
Ready for your date, liam,

25:36.769 --> 25:39.269
But please be careful.

25:39.272 --> 25:41.342
I worry enough
About your ability

25:41.340 --> 25:43.040
To lead
One double life.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.482
I don't think you have
The heart for a second.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.747
[♪♪]

26:01.459 --> 26:03.859
[doorbell chimes]

26:04.930 --> 26:06.030
Hi.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.232
Hi. These are for you.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.574
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.641
Come on in.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.237
Hi!

26:20.246 --> 26:21.446
Um, hello.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.377
Uh, it was
The strangest thing.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.422
I was getting ready, and--

26:25.418 --> 26:27.688
Drew and i
Were in the neighborhood

26:27.687 --> 26:30.287
And wanted to return a book
To sophie.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.459
This one.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.188
[chuckles]

26:33.192 --> 26:34.932
Where are my manners?

26:34.927 --> 26:37.427
Um, drew and nina,
This is liam.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.260
No limo tonight?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.895
Uh, i have a car here
In town.

26:40.900 --> 26:44.070
So you have a place here
And a place in new york?

26:44.070 --> 26:46.170
You don't really
See that very often.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.972
Exactly what kind of
Consulting do you do?

26:48.975 --> 26:49.935
Drew, you don't need

26:49.942 --> 26:50.982
To interrogate
Poor liam here.

26:50.977 --> 26:51.907
(sotto)
I thought that's what

26:51.911 --> 26:53.111
I was supposed to do?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.482
How about
A glass of wine?

26:55.481 --> 26:57.551
Wine sounds wonderful!

26:57.550 --> 26:58.880
And it gives us
The opportunity

26:58.884 --> 27:00.154
To get to know
A little bit more

27:00.152 --> 27:01.422
About liam here.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.890
Great!

27:05.090 --> 27:06.720
So how long were
You in guayana?

27:06.726 --> 27:08.786
I did the full
Two-year volunteer rotation.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.764
It's really
An amazing country.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.403
That must've been
Tough, though.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.058
Volunteering was
The hardest thing i ever
Did,

27:14.066 --> 27:15.596
But i wouldn't trade it
For anything.

27:15.601 --> 27:16.671
Wow.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.799
You're full of surprises.

27:22.107 --> 27:23.837
Well, this has
Been fun.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.583
We should all go out
When we have more time.

27:26.579 --> 27:28.209
Absolutely. And drew,
I'm going to hold you

27:28.214 --> 27:29.384
To your offer
To play hoops.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.252
I'm no lebron james,
But maybe a dwayne wade.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.420
All right,
But i will warn you--

27:32.418 --> 27:34.748
Once i lace up,

27:34.754 --> 27:36.024
I'm more like 6'6" with
A 40-inch vertical, so.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.092
[laughs]

27:37.089 --> 27:38.659
Have fun
Tonight, kids.

27:38.658 --> 27:39.918
Bye!

27:39.925 --> 27:42.885
And thanks for, um,
Bringing the book back.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.625
I think they liked you.

27:48.634 --> 27:49.934
Well, that's great,

27:49.935 --> 27:51.895
But they're not the ones
I'm trying to impress.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.706
I like you too.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.678
Now, that's what
I like to hear.

27:57.677 --> 27:58.637
[laughs]

27:58.644 --> 27:59.814
You ready for dinner?

27:59.812 --> 28:01.712
I have the perfect place.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.914
I was surprised.

28:03.916 --> 28:06.116
Nina and drew and i
Have been friends forever.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.718
So what made them
Start to date?

28:08.721 --> 28:10.121
Actually, i think

28:10.122 --> 28:11.392
They'd been in love
For years,

28:11.390 --> 28:13.120
But they were both
Just so afraid

28:13.125 --> 28:14.355
Of ruining
The friendship

28:14.360 --> 28:16.060
That they never
Gave it a chance.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.962
How's the cobbler?

28:17.963 --> 28:19.363
Mm! Wonderful, harris.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.655
As always.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.996
Everything is delicious.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.542
You mean that,

28:24.537 --> 28:27.037
Or are you just saying
What you think i want to
Hear?

28:27.039 --> 28:29.339
No, it was really good.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.811
[phone rings]

28:30.810 --> 28:32.680
Oh. Sorry.

28:32.678 --> 28:36.148
I've got to
Take this. Work.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.318
[♪♪]

28:44.589 --> 28:47.789
So, liam...

28:47.793 --> 28:49.063
You ever been married?

28:49.061 --> 28:50.491
Um, no.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.856
Why not?
Something wrong with you?

28:52.865 --> 28:55.265
[chuckles, then stops]

28:56.901 --> 29:00.601
So no alarm bells
Went off for either of you?

29:00.606 --> 29:01.966
We loved him.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.574
Even drew,

29:03.576 --> 29:05.776
Who was prepared to duke it
Out
With him beforehand.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.078
How's dinner going?

29:07.079 --> 29:08.949
We're having a nice time.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.418
But he still hasn't
Mentioned his parents,

29:11.417 --> 29:12.817
And he keeps
Changing the subject

29:12.818 --> 29:14.688
Every time
I bring up his work.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.047
Give him time.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.315
How's it going with harris?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.793
It doesn't look good.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.526
Maybe i shouldn't
Have left him alone.

29:25.531 --> 29:29.201
Well, let me know how it
Goes,
'Cause he seems really
Great.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.101
Bye.

29:34.172 --> 29:36.172
That's her recipe
For peach cobbler

29:36.175 --> 29:38.275
You're eating.

29:38.277 --> 29:38.907
It's the best
I've ever tasted.

29:38.911 --> 29:39.841
Honestly.

29:39.845 --> 29:41.575
Am i interrupting?

29:41.580 --> 29:42.850
Not at all!

29:42.848 --> 29:45.248
Come. Sit.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.621
I was just
Telling liam here

29:47.620 --> 29:49.120
The story of lola

29:49.121 --> 29:51.051
And why i named the
Restaurant
After her.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.486
I thought you didn't like
To talk about that.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.892
Well, the story's
Not for everyone,

29:55.895 --> 29:57.425
But liam here

29:57.429 --> 29:58.829
Seemed to understand.

29:58.831 --> 30:01.271
I'm sorry
You lost her so soon.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.827
Well, it's better
To have loved and lost

30:03.836 --> 30:05.266
And all that, right?

30:05.271 --> 30:08.871
I like to think
She's here with me every
Day.

30:11.342 --> 30:12.742
Nice to meet you, liam.

30:12.745 --> 30:13.905
You too.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.380
The next time,

30:17.383 --> 30:19.553
You've got to try
The chocolate mousse.

30:19.552 --> 30:20.952
It's not to be missed.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.253
Can't wait.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.391
What?

30:28.394 --> 30:29.994
Wow.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.125
He must really like you
To open up about lola.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.362
Is that a good thing?

30:34.366 --> 30:36.326
Yes.

30:36.335 --> 30:41.665
It's...a great thing.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.844
[creek trickling]

30:48.279 --> 30:50.949
Harris actually
Liked him?

30:50.950 --> 30:52.320
Loved him.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.688
Sounds like he passed
Your little test, right?

30:54.687 --> 30:55.687
With flying colors.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.788
But he still won't
Talk about his work.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.390
Or his family.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.291
It's like
He's an open book

31:01.293 --> 31:02.733
About some things,

31:02.728 --> 31:05.328
And then completely
Mysterious about others.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.401
It sounds like
Problem isn't him,

31:07.399 --> 31:08.929
It's you.

31:08.934 --> 31:11.644
What are you
Talking about?

31:11.637 --> 31:13.767
I get that you have
Trust issues.

31:13.772 --> 31:14.942
Who wouldn't
In your position?

31:14.940 --> 31:16.270
But you need
To be careful

31:16.275 --> 31:16.965
Not to project
Your stuff onto liam.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.176
It's not fair.

31:18.177 --> 31:21.547
Okay, well, what about
Just-- just one more test?

31:21.547 --> 31:22.647
I felt so much better

31:22.648 --> 31:24.548
After he met
You guys last night

31:24.550 --> 31:26.120
And you liked him.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.148
Sophie.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.392
Okay, just hear me out.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.748
I want to see him at work,

31:30.756 --> 31:33.156
Just find out what
This whole consulting thing

31:33.158 --> 31:34.358
Is all about.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.190
I mean,
What could it hurt?

31:37.195 --> 31:39.325
Come on!

31:40.231 --> 31:43.031
[♪♪]

31:47.805 --> 31:49.865

31:51.009 --> 31:52.939
Can't talk now.
Finally in the zone.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.645
Thrilled to hear it,
But we still need to meet

31:54.647 --> 31:56.807
To go over the details
Of the rescheduled reveal.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.175
Today's not good.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.353
So, today at 1:00,

31:59.351 --> 32:00.451
At the river village
Restaurant,

32:00.452 --> 32:01.792
I've booked
A lovely outdoor table.

32:01.787 --> 32:03.287
You can walk over
From the marina.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.219
Can't we do this
Later this week?

32:04.223 --> 32:05.623
See you at one.

32:05.624 --> 32:06.864

32:20.939 --> 32:22.669
[phone ringing]

32:22.675 --> 32:24.775
Hey!
I was going to call you,

32:24.777 --> 32:26.707
But didn't want to
Bother you at work.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.382
I was worried about
The same thing.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.050
I'm not interrupting,
Am i?

32:30.049 --> 32:32.479
Not at all.
Really enjoyed last night.

32:32.484 --> 32:33.454
Me too. I--

32:33.452 --> 32:34.422
[ship's bell clangs]

32:34.420 --> 32:35.520
What was that?

32:35.521 --> 32:36.891
Are you--
Are you at the marina?

32:36.889 --> 32:38.589
Uh, yeah.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.260
I'm, uh, meeting a client at
River village restaurant at
One,

32:41.260 --> 32:42.260
A business meeting.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.461
A client?

32:43.462 --> 32:44.962
Um, that's good.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.434
Maybe we can figure out

32:46.432 --> 32:47.862
A time to see
Each other again.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.726
Yeah. I'd like that.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.135
Um, i've got to go.

32:54.172 --> 32:55.172
Bye.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.214
Bye.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.939
[♪♪]

33:01.479 --> 33:03.079
So i've rescheduled
The reveal

33:03.082 --> 33:04.452
For friday at six,

33:04.450 --> 33:06.920
And i will handcuff you
To me if i have to.

33:06.919 --> 33:08.019
It's such
Terrible timing.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.390
Sophie and i
Are just starting

33:09.388 --> 33:10.518
To get to know
Each other.

33:10.522 --> 33:11.792
You haven't told her,
Have you?

33:11.790 --> 33:12.890
Once she finds out

33:12.891 --> 33:14.361
I'm gabriel august,
That's all i'll be to her.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.090
That's all i'll be
To everybody.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.325
[jackie]:
How can you know that,

33:17.329 --> 33:18.629
If you don't trust her
Enough
To tell her the truth?

33:18.630 --> 33:20.600
Well, you know how
It was with my parents.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.529
People treated them
Differently
Because they were stars.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.335
Hi.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.567
Oh, no.
This is not happening.

33:27.573 --> 33:28.643
It's her.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.710
She's pretty!

33:29.708 --> 33:31.268
Hey.

33:31.276 --> 33:33.476
Sophie.
This is a surprise.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.309
I-i was, um...

33:35.314 --> 33:37.584
Covering a story
Just around the corner,

33:37.583 --> 33:40.723
And remembered you saying
You were having lunch here,
So--

33:40.719 --> 33:42.349
So you just stopped by?

33:43.287 --> 33:45.257
That's weird, isn't it?

33:45.257 --> 33:46.987
It was all very spontaneous.

33:46.992 --> 33:48.462
Um...

33:48.460 --> 33:50.090
I'll leave you to your
Lunch.

33:51.429 --> 33:52.899
-you're jackie billicks.
-yes.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.258
The literary agent.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.066
Oh, um, i have to say,

33:56.068 --> 33:58.698
I'm not used to being
Recognized
Outside of new york.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.474
I saw you speak in 2011

34:01.473 --> 34:03.543
At the brooklyn
Publishing symposium.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.442
You were so inspiring.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.444
Jackie,

34:06.445 --> 34:08.344
This is
Sophie atkinson.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.147
It's wonderful
To meet you, sophie.

34:10.149 --> 34:13.119
I actually write book
Reviews
For the portland record,

34:13.118 --> 34:17.818
And i probably owe you
And gabriel august

34:17.822 --> 34:18.763
My review
Wasn't very favorable.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.056
No apology needed.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.789
You were
Just doing your job.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.634
I can't believe
You didn't tell me

34:24.630 --> 34:26.060
You knew gabriel
August's agent.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.025
Well, it's great to meet
You.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.333
I'll let you two talk.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.103
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.603
This is just
A social call anyway.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.705
Please join us. Please.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.407
Oh...

34:37.409 --> 34:39.579
Thank you.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.976
I keep telling gabriel
That he'll feel better

34:47.985 --> 34:50.616
If he tells the world
Who he is,

34:50.621 --> 34:52.161
But men, you know?

34:52.157 --> 34:53.786
So stubborn.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.762
But-- but it is
Really happening?

34:55.761 --> 34:57.891
Oh, yeah. Next friday.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.896
If i have to drag him
Kicking and screaming.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.768
[sophie laughs]

35:01.767 --> 35:03.327
Okay.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.335
At the risk of
Sounding like a teenager,

35:05.337 --> 35:06.837
What is he like?

35:06.839 --> 35:08.439
[laughs]

35:08.440 --> 35:10.970
Well, he's, uh, smart.

35:10.976 --> 35:12.406
Quite smart,
When he wants to be.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.911
He is genuinely talented,

35:14.913 --> 35:17.513
He's very handsome.

35:17.516 --> 35:21.046
He's also obstinate,
He's private to a fault,

35:21.053 --> 35:22.323
And sometimes he exhibits

35:22.321 --> 35:24.121
The same amount of
Judgment as my beagle.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.663
[both laughing]

35:26.557 --> 35:28.527
I felt bad,

35:28.527 --> 35:29.887
Writing
The review i did,

35:29.895 --> 35:32.795
But the truth is,

35:32.798 --> 35:36.698
I really want his next book
To be great, like the first
One,

35:36.702 --> 35:38.802
And maybe not having secrets
Will help.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.344
Maybe his next book
Will be his masterpiece.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.740
I hope so, sophie.

35:42.741 --> 35:46.381
Well, i've got a deadline
That needs some love.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.908
Jackie, i'm so glad
We got the chance to talk.

35:48.914 --> 35:49.984
Same here!

35:49.982 --> 35:51.312
And next time
You're in new york,

35:51.316 --> 35:52.476
Give me a jingle,
We'll have lunch.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.224
I would love that.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.989
I will see you later?

35:55.988 --> 35:57.648
I can't wait.
I'll call you.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.986
Napkin...

35:58.991 --> 35:59.991
[chuckling]

35:59.992 --> 36:02.132
Wow...

36:02.127 --> 36:03.857
Thanks for that, jackie.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.832
You need to tell her,

36:05.831 --> 36:07.161
Before this--

36:07.166 --> 36:09.826
Whatever
This is between you two--

36:09.835 --> 36:10.865
Goes any further.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.469
Well, it's easier said
Than done.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.441
I never said
It was gonna be easy.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.913
It's so beautiful
Down here.

36:21.914 --> 36:23.484
I never think
To do this.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.482
I come here every sunset.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.954
Helps clear my head.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.992
It's one of my favorite
Things
About the city.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.717
Why portland?

36:30.722 --> 36:32.622
I have a feeling
You could be

36:32.624 --> 36:34.264
Just about anywhere
Right now.

36:34.259 --> 36:37.159
Oh, yeah? Well, i could
Ask you the same thing.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.432
Portland's my home.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.531
The truth?

36:41.533 --> 36:42.633
The truth.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.004
I spent some time here
As a kid.

36:45.003 --> 36:47.203
Always loved it.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.212
What?

36:50.141 --> 36:53.081
Okay. I'm really bad at
This,

36:53.078 --> 36:54.778
But i have
A confession to make.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.680
Oh. Good confession
Or bad confession?

36:57.683 --> 37:00.723
I actually know
Who you really are.

37:01.752 --> 37:03.152
Oh. I see.

37:04.622 --> 37:05.962
You're not mad at me?

37:05.958 --> 37:07.458
Why would i be mad?

37:07.459 --> 37:09.059
Because i didn't
Tell you the truth.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.901
You're entitled
To your privacy.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.127
I imagine growing up
With famous parents

37:14.132 --> 37:16.132
Must have been hard.

37:16.134 --> 37:18.104
You meant my parents.

37:18.103 --> 37:19.273
Right.

37:19.271 --> 37:22.011
Yeah, it was
Complicated.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.867
Life in the spotlight
Can be rough.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.075
Believe me, i know.

37:25.077 --> 37:26.207
Yeah?

37:26.211 --> 37:31.681
I had a bad experience
Dating a famous person.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.383
Actually, we were engaged.

37:33.385 --> 37:35.045
It ended a few months ago.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.253
Engaged?

37:36.255 --> 37:37.915
I probably should've
Mentioned it earlier.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.823
No, not at all.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.515
Were you okay?

37:42.426 --> 37:44.456
It was hard at first,

37:44.463 --> 37:46.303
But i'm much better
The last few days.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.498
I'm glad
To hear that.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.030
One of the magazines

37:51.036 --> 37:52.996
I interviewed at
In new york

37:53.005 --> 37:54.935
Asked me to come
Work for them.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.640
That's a big change!

37:56.642 --> 37:58.642
Well, i may not
Have a choice.

37:58.644 --> 38:01.384
It seems like the daily's
Days are numbered.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.310
Aw, it sounds like
A great opportunity.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.145
I was thinking of it
More as a huge disaster.

38:06.151 --> 38:08.291
I just mean, you know,
It gives you

38:08.287 --> 38:09.447
A chance to figure out

38:09.454 --> 38:10.754
What it is you
Really want to do.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.056
Maybe make a change,
If you want.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.728
Sometimes i'd give anything
To just start over.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.229
This is me.

38:23.235 --> 38:24.595
You know...

38:24.603 --> 38:27.403
You're really easy
To talk to.

38:27.406 --> 38:30.266
Not always, but...

38:30.275 --> 38:32.105
It's easy with you.

38:33.377 --> 38:36.007
[♪♪]

38:42.953 --> 38:44.623
Thank you.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.123
For what?

38:46.124 --> 38:47.794
I don't know...

38:47.793 --> 38:50.733
Just being liam bradley.

38:51.762 --> 38:54.062
[♪♪]

39:05.176 --> 39:08.106
John, if you have time,
I'd love to meet.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.713
I have some ideas
About a website,

39:09.715 --> 39:11.815
And i need some tech advice.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.747
Tuesday's perfect!

39:13.752 --> 39:15.822
See you then.

39:18.589 --> 39:21.189
[indistinct exchange]

39:29.300 --> 39:31.970
You should come.
It's so much fun.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.270
I'm afraid i'm not
Much of a dancer.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.441
Mm, i'll give you
A few pointers.

39:34.439 --> 39:36.939
You'll be an expert
By the end of the night.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.382
Remember, 8:30.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.208
It's called frankfurt,
Over on burnside.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.383
Hope to see you there.
Nice to meet you.

39:43.382 --> 39:44.712
You too.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.346

Hey!

39:55.293 --> 39:56.733
Oh, hi!

39:56.728 --> 39:59.728
You just missed
This totally gorgeous guy.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.231
Did i?

40:01.233 --> 40:03.503
I think he liked me,
But who knows?

40:03.502 --> 40:05.772
It's so hard to tell
Sometimes.

40:05.771 --> 40:06.871
But i asked him out!

40:06.872 --> 40:08.472
Do you think
That was too forward?

40:08.473 --> 40:10.873
I don't know.
What did he say?

40:10.876 --> 40:12.736
I didn't give him
A chance to say anything.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.914
I hate being rejected.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.552
Guess i'll find out
Tonight, huh?

40:16.548 --> 40:19.348
Come on. Berkmann'll kill us
If we're late.

40:34.131 --> 40:35.971
Uh, i...

40:35.967 --> 40:38.697
Wasn't sure
If you would call tonight.

40:38.703 --> 40:40.003
I stopped by
Your office earlier.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.735
I thought you might want
To grab lunch.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.210
Oh yeah?

40:43.208 --> 40:45.138
Um, sorry i missed you.

[car horn honks

40:46.545 --> 40:50.145
It sounds like
You're in the car.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.378
Are you going
Somewhere special tonight?

40:52.384 --> 40:54.384
Uh, no.

40:54.386 --> 40:55.616
Just clearing my head.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.220
I'm actually way behind
On this project.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.522
I'll probably spend
Most of the night working.

40:58.523 --> 41:01.893
Working?
That doesn't sound very fun.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.533
Yeah, not looking forward
To it.

41:04.529 --> 41:06.099
But we're still on
For tomorrow, right?

41:06.097 --> 41:07.427
I guess.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.102
If you still want to.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.940
Of course i do.
I'll see you then, okay?

41:11.937 --> 41:14.297
Okay. Bye.

Bye.

Working all night, huh?

42:03.220 --> 42:04.720
He could've just told me.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.363
Sophie?

42:06.358 --> 42:07.958
Oh.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.529
You're not...

42:09.528 --> 42:11.288
This isn't--

42:11.296 --> 42:13.756
This is my friend peter.

42:14.932 --> 42:15.832
What are you doing here?

42:15.834 --> 42:17.274
Good question.

42:19.803 --> 42:22.473
[♪♪]

42:24.108 --> 42:26.878
I felt like
The world's biggest jerk.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.478
I should've trusted liam.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.610
You're not the world's
Biggest jerk.

42:30.615 --> 42:33.315
I mean, there have to be
At least two bigger ones.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.018
You--
You were completely right.

42:35.020 --> 42:37.920
This was just about
Me being scared.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.193
Hey!

42:39.190 --> 42:40.720
Don't beat yourself up
Too much.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.185
Nobody blames you for being
Careful about who you date.

42:43.194 --> 42:45.664
But eventually you need
To take a leap of faith

42:45.664 --> 42:46.904
And jump back in.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.568
And that's exactly
What i'm gonna do.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.097
I'm seeing liam tonight,

42:50.101 --> 42:52.001
I'm just going to come clean
About everything

42:52.003 --> 42:55.573
And tell him
The truth.

42:55.574 --> 42:57.074
You think
That's a good idea?

42:57.075 --> 42:59.235
What kind of relationship
Can i hope to have

42:59.244 --> 43:00.844
If it starts out
Being dishonest?

43:00.845 --> 43:02.645
Are you sure
This doesn't fall into

43:02.647 --> 43:05.077
The "what-he-doesn't-know-
Won't-hurt-him" category?

43:05.083 --> 43:07.383
We just don't want to see
You
Get hurt again.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.915
I need to do this.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.991
You have to
Tell her the truth.

43:11.990 --> 43:13.420
I am tonight.

43:13.425 --> 43:14.885
How are you
Going to do it?

43:14.893 --> 43:16.063
I'm taking her
To the cabin.

43:16.061 --> 43:17.231
I'll tell her there.

43:17.228 --> 43:18.728
I just hope she
Doesn't freak out.

43:18.730 --> 43:19.930
I mean, if she thinks

43:19.931 --> 43:21.131
I've been lying to her
This whole time--

43:21.132 --> 43:22.832
Stop.

43:22.834 --> 43:25.104
Liam, you're doing
The right thing.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.573
Look at
The bright side.

43:26.571 --> 43:28.611
This will make your big
Reveal a whole lot easier,

43:28.607 --> 43:29.867
One way or another.

43:29.874 --> 43:31.874
And i'm proud of you
For doing that too.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.606
Not like
I have much choice.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.312
Okay. Hugs.

43:35.313 --> 43:36.453
Like the good old days.

43:36.448 --> 43:38.278
Mm.

43:38.283 --> 43:39.383
I'll let you know
How it goes.

43:39.384 --> 43:41.324
Yeah. I'll be
Thinking of you, kiddo.

43:41.319 --> 43:43.549
Good luck.

43:48.892 --> 43:50.762
It's so cozy.

43:50.762 --> 43:52.562
Makes me
Want to curl up

43:52.564 --> 43:55.004
With a good book
And a glass of wine.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.670
I always came here
With my parents.

43:58.670 --> 43:59.870
Do you have
One of those spots

43:59.871 --> 44:01.701
Where you go to
And you just feel safe?

44:01.706 --> 44:03.366
Forest park.

44:03.375 --> 44:07.335
There's this old wooden
Bridge
Surrounded by trees.

44:07.345 --> 44:08.745
When i get stressed,

44:08.747 --> 44:11.077
I just stand there
And listen to the water,

44:11.082 --> 44:13.652
And all the troubles
Melt away.

44:14.551 --> 44:16.091
It's a magical place.

44:16.087 --> 44:17.917
It sounds wonderful.

44:17.922 --> 44:19.462
Everybody needs
Some place to escape to.

44:19.457 --> 44:21.057
Exactly.

44:21.059 --> 44:23.329
That's what it's like
For me out here.

44:23.328 --> 44:25.728
Dinner awaits.

44:25.730 --> 44:29.070
It's beautiful!

44:29.067 --> 44:31.727
I didn't realize
You were such a romantic.

44:31.736 --> 44:33.996
Ah, i didn't either.

44:36.607 --> 44:37.937
This is delicious.

44:37.942 --> 44:40.182
Mm. I can't cook
To save my life,

44:40.178 --> 44:42.378
But i am fantastic
At ordering well.

44:44.815 --> 44:46.975
Uh, look, there's
Something important

44:46.985 --> 44:48.115
I need to tell you,

44:48.119 --> 44:50.849
But i'm not really
Sure how to say it.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.885
More couscous?

44:52.891 --> 44:54.421
I'm fine.

44:54.426 --> 44:56.056
Right.
Uh, all right, uh...

44:56.061 --> 44:57.661
The thing is,

44:57.662 --> 44:58.962
When we first met,

44:58.963 --> 45:00.763
I didn't think things
Would progress so far.

45:00.765 --> 45:02.025
Liam, wait.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.233
Before
You say anything,

45:03.234 --> 45:06.144
I... I have to
Tell you something.

45:06.137 --> 45:07.437
I...

45:07.439 --> 45:10.009
Haven't been totally
Honest with you.

45:10.008 --> 45:10.968
You haven't?

45:10.975 --> 45:12.775
Remember how i told you

45:12.777 --> 45:14.777
I recently went
Through a bad break-up?

45:14.779 --> 45:16.249
You're getting back
Together with him.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.147
What?

45:17.148 --> 45:18.178
No!

45:18.183 --> 45:19.353
Absolutely not.

45:19.350 --> 45:22.850
Never. I just...

45:22.854 --> 45:24.824
The whole thing
Actually hit me

45:24.823 --> 45:28.123
A lot harder
Than i admitted.

45:28.126 --> 45:30.186
He was a professional
Athlete,

45:30.195 --> 45:32.695
And the break-up
Was very public,

45:32.697 --> 45:34.627
And...

45:34.632 --> 45:37.702
Pretty humiliating,
Honestly.

45:37.702 --> 45:39.472
My terrible love life
Went viral.

45:39.471 --> 45:41.141
That must've been awful.

45:41.139 --> 45:42.109
Yeah.

45:42.107 --> 45:43.137
A word of advice--

45:43.141 --> 45:44.471
Never date
A famous person.

45:44.476 --> 45:47.806
I won't make
That mistake again.

45:49.046 --> 45:53.016
The worst part,
Though, was that...

45:53.017 --> 45:57.017
This man that
I thought i loved

45:57.021 --> 46:00.021
Ended up being someone
Completely different

46:00.024 --> 46:02.194
Than i thought he was.

46:02.193 --> 46:05.833
I guess i just lost
My ability to trust men.

46:06.830 --> 46:09.800
And so when i met you,

46:09.801 --> 46:11.401
I was like,

46:11.402 --> 46:14.572
"wow, too good
To be true."

46:14.572 --> 46:16.642
And so i've kind of been
Giving you little tests

46:16.641 --> 46:18.111
Just to prove

46:18.109 --> 46:21.079
That you aren't...
Too good to be true.

46:21.079 --> 46:22.209
Tests?

46:22.213 --> 46:23.383
Yeah.

46:23.381 --> 46:25.311
This is embarrassing.

46:25.316 --> 46:28.786
I... My friends
Interrogating you.

46:28.787 --> 46:30.517
Me dropping by
During your lunch

46:30.522 --> 46:31.722
With your client.

46:31.723 --> 46:33.293
I kind of arranged
Those things

46:33.291 --> 46:35.491
Just to help myself
Make sure

46:35.493 --> 46:38.393
That this was real.

46:38.396 --> 46:40.296
Oh! And the girl
You met

46:40.298 --> 46:42.228
In front of
My office, tabitha,

46:42.233 --> 46:43.603
We actually
Work together,

46:43.601 --> 46:47.571
And i overheard her
Asking you out.

46:47.572 --> 46:50.072
You're the only woman
I wanted to go out with.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.444
I know that now.

46:51.442 --> 46:53.242
And i should've

46:53.244 --> 46:55.114
Trusted it
From the beginning.

46:55.113 --> 46:56.553
I'm so sorry, liam.

46:56.548 --> 46:58.008
I don't know
What else to say.

46:58.016 --> 47:00.046
So that's it?

47:00.051 --> 47:01.881
That's what you haven't
Been honest about?

47:01.886 --> 47:03.086
You hate me,
Don't you?

47:03.087 --> 47:05.187
Sophie,
I don't hate you.

47:05.190 --> 47:07.060
I'm falling in love
With you.

47:17.768 --> 47:21.468
Okay.

47:21.472 --> 47:23.612
That went better
Than i thought it would.

47:24.575 --> 47:35.415
[♪♪]

47:35.420 --> 47:40.020
I feel so much better
Having that out in the open.

47:40.024 --> 47:45.804
I've been so nervous all
Night.

47:45.797 --> 47:47.627
There was something
You wanted to say to me.

47:47.632 --> 47:49.472
What? Oh. Oh, nothing.

47:49.467 --> 47:50.567
Are you sure?

47:50.568 --> 47:51.798
I'm so sorry.

47:51.803 --> 47:53.473
I feel like i kind of
Hijacked your moment.

47:53.471 --> 47:55.241
Ah, it's not important.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.940
More wine?

47:58.208 --> 47:59.578
Please.

48:01.912 --> 48:04.482
I can't wait to see
What's for dessert.

48:11.755 --> 48:13.515
What was i
Supposed to do?

48:13.524 --> 48:15.464
You were supposed to
Tell her the truth.

48:15.460 --> 48:16.630
Well, this athlete
She was engaged to

48:16.628 --> 48:17.658
Broke her heart,

48:17.662 --> 48:19.032
And half the country
Was talking about it.

48:19.030 --> 48:21.130
She swore she'd never
Date a famous person again.

48:21.132 --> 48:22.772
What do you think

48:22.767 --> 48:24.067
She's gonna do when
She finds out who i really
Am?

48:24.068 --> 48:25.298
I can't just dump
All this on her.

48:25.303 --> 48:26.603
You've run out of time.

48:26.604 --> 48:28.044
The reveal is tomorrow
Night.

48:28.039 --> 48:29.239
Well, then,
Let's postpone it.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.470
We can't.

48:30.475 --> 48:31.865
Get me a meeting
With the publishers.

48:31.876 --> 48:33.876
I'll find a way
To change their minds.

48:33.878 --> 48:35.778
It won't be easy
To convince them, liam.

48:35.780 --> 48:37.880
Well, i'll find a way
To convince them.

48:37.882 --> 48:39.822
I have to.

48:40.717 --> 48:42.117
They can't do that.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.620
Unfortunately,
The suits call the shots,

48:43.621 --> 48:45.691
And they can do
Whatever they want.

48:45.690 --> 48:46.920
But just to cut
All the book reviews?

48:46.925 --> 48:49.055
That-- that doesn't
Even make any sense!

48:49.060 --> 48:50.960
They want more space
For video games and movies.

48:50.962 --> 48:52.532
They're even making me
Create
A whole new section

48:52.530 --> 48:53.930
On celebrity gossip.

48:53.932 --> 48:56.832
Book reviews just don't
Have enough juice these
Days.

48:56.834 --> 48:59.004
Look, i've been
A team player, phil,

48:59.003 --> 49:00.603
Covering music and movies,

49:00.605 --> 49:02.335
Whatever you needed,

49:02.340 --> 49:04.570
But you know the book
Reviews
Are what i love.

49:04.575 --> 49:06.735
That's the reason
I came to the daily.

49:06.744 --> 49:09.314
What can i tell you, sophie?
It's a business.

49:09.314 --> 49:12.014
Lots of people read books!

49:12.016 --> 49:13.576
I mean, sure,
It's a changing industry,
But--

49:13.584 --> 49:15.384
No more book reviews.

49:15.386 --> 49:17.546
I wish
It was different.

49:25.862 --> 49:28.732
Then i don't know
If i can stay.

49:32.336 --> 49:34.836
I need to figure out
What it is i want to do.

49:38.475 --> 49:41.975
Well, that's a decision
You're gonna have to make.

49:41.980 --> 49:44.350
But make it quickly.
I got a paper to run.

49:44.349 --> 49:47.519
[♪♪]

49:52.322 --> 49:54.492
[sophie]: so you don't think
It's a stupid thing to do?

49:54.492 --> 49:55.932
Not at all,
But it's a big step.

49:55.927 --> 49:57.887
I'm terrified.

49:58.962 --> 50:00.862
But i think it's what i
Want.

50:00.865 --> 50:02.595
You were right,
That's what's important.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.200
Well, it sounds
Like a good plan.

50:04.202 --> 50:05.532
I'm gonna
Go with my gut.

50:05.536 --> 50:07.596
I guess it worked
With you yesterday.

50:07.605 --> 50:09.165
That's right.

50:09.173 --> 50:10.713
Look, i-i found out

50:10.708 --> 50:12.938
That i have to go to new
York
For a meeting tomorrow,

50:12.944 --> 50:14.584
So i'm a little frazzled.
I fly out in a couple of
Hours.

50:14.579 --> 50:16.149
Wait. New york? Why?

50:16.147 --> 50:18.207
Just a contractual thing
I need to address,

50:18.216 --> 50:19.776
But i have to do it
In person.

50:19.784 --> 50:20.854
How long will you be gone?

50:20.852 --> 50:22.182
Just overnight.
I'll be back tomorrow.

50:22.186 --> 50:24.586
Well, do you think

50:24.589 --> 50:26.689
You might be up for a date
Night
Tomorrow night?

50:26.691 --> 50:28.791
How about an early dinner?
Say, 5:30?

50:28.793 --> 50:31.893
Sure. I'm down
For the early bird special.

50:31.896 --> 50:33.756
Have a safe flight.

50:33.765 --> 50:36.695
Okay. Bye.

50:36.701 --> 50:38.801
Bye.

50:40.504 --> 50:42.104
That sounds
So romantic.

50:42.106 --> 50:44.206
Dinner
By candlelight?

50:44.208 --> 50:46.178
Yeah. It...it was.

50:46.177 --> 50:49.047
He told me he was
Falling in love with me,

50:49.047 --> 50:50.977
And then we kissed.

50:50.982 --> 50:53.382
Wow!

50:53.384 --> 50:56.594
And you want to know
The best part?

50:56.587 --> 50:58.147
I trust him.

50:58.156 --> 50:59.216
Oh yeah?

50:59.223 --> 51:02.093
Not a "he passed
The test" kind of trust,

51:02.093 --> 51:03.833
A trust where
I want to kick myself

51:03.828 --> 51:05.998
For having ever given him
A test in the first place.

51:05.997 --> 51:08.457
I never thought
I would

51:08.466 --> 51:10.426
Feel like this
About someone again,

51:10.435 --> 51:13.195
But he just
Keeps surprising me.

51:13.204 --> 51:14.674
This is so great.

51:14.672 --> 51:16.572
I'm so happy for you.

51:16.574 --> 51:19.384
He's on a trip
To new york for one day,

51:19.377 --> 51:21.137
And i already miss him.

51:21.145 --> 51:23.405
What am i in, high school?

51:23.414 --> 51:25.754
You are in love.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.150
Oh.

51:27.151 --> 51:30.091
Okay, enough
About my love life.

51:30.088 --> 51:33.588
I have something
I want to show you.

51:33.591 --> 51:34.991
I put it together
Last night,

51:34.992 --> 51:38.032
And you have to promise me
That you will be nice.

51:38.029 --> 51:40.159
"rivetingreads.com."

51:40.164 --> 51:41.334
What is it?

51:41.332 --> 51:43.172
My new business.

51:43.167 --> 51:44.397
Your new business?

51:44.402 --> 51:46.202
What about the paper?

51:46.204 --> 51:49.414
Well, liam said something
To me the other day

51:49.407 --> 51:52.367
About following
My dreams

51:52.376 --> 51:53.906
And doing what
I want to do,

51:53.911 --> 51:55.411
And i think this might be
It.

51:55.413 --> 51:58.253
This is so fantastic.

51:58.249 --> 52:00.019
I have a meeting
With my editor later,

52:00.017 --> 52:01.077
And then it goes live.

52:01.085 --> 52:03.245
Looks like
Liam's good for you.

52:03.254 --> 52:05.554
Mm-hmm.

52:05.556 --> 52:08.016
[♪♪]

52:08.025 --> 52:09.885
So how are you
Holding up?

52:09.894 --> 52:11.264
I'm nervous.

52:11.262 --> 52:12.662
Yeah, so am i.

52:12.663 --> 52:14.903
You're not supposed
To admit that to me.

52:14.899 --> 52:15.999
[laughs]

52:16.000 --> 52:18.430
Liam, i'm not gonna
Sugarcoat this.

52:18.436 --> 52:19.696
These people are sharks.

52:19.704 --> 52:21.204
And i don't even know

52:21.205 --> 52:23.065
If they care enough
To do what you're asking.

52:23.074 --> 52:25.344
So expectations are low.
All right, then.

52:25.343 --> 52:28.943
Liam, jackie.
It's great to see you both.

52:28.946 --> 52:31.446
Hey, are you as excited
About the new sales as we
Are?

52:31.449 --> 52:32.749
Um, yeah.

52:32.750 --> 52:33.920
Yeah. You should be.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.678
Please, have a seat.

52:35.686 --> 52:37.216
So...

52:37.221 --> 52:39.021
What can we do for you?

52:39.023 --> 52:42.423
First off, thank you
So much for your time.

52:42.426 --> 52:45.256
Anything for one
Of our favorite authors.

52:45.263 --> 52:47.903
I'm not so sure
How to put this,

52:47.899 --> 52:51.029
But for some personal
Reasons,
Um...

52:51.035 --> 52:52.695
I'm asking that you

52:52.703 --> 52:57.173
Reconsider having me
Reveal myself as gabriel
August.

52:58.441 --> 52:59.781
Uh...

52:59.777 --> 53:02.947
You do know the reveal
Is scheduled for tonight?

53:02.947 --> 53:03.907
Oh...

53:03.915 --> 53:04.905
I know.

53:04.916 --> 53:07.246
And i'll eventually
Go through with it.

53:07.251 --> 53:09.551
Just not tonight.

53:09.554 --> 53:10.994
I give you my word.

53:10.988 --> 53:12.718
Well, we don't really
Need your word, liam.

53:12.723 --> 53:15.663
We have a contract
That guarantees it.

53:15.660 --> 53:16.930
Right.

53:16.928 --> 53:20.558
I just need you to delay
The reveal a few more weeks.

53:20.565 --> 53:22.455
Liam's not
Being unreasonable.

53:22.466 --> 53:24.226
He's just asking
For more time.

53:24.235 --> 53:26.735
Jackie, he has already
Canceled once.

53:26.737 --> 53:29.307
This has all been timed
To the release of the new
Book.

53:29.307 --> 53:30.807
We've built
A marketing approach,

53:30.808 --> 53:33.878
Not to mention a substantial
Amount of effort and money,

53:33.878 --> 53:36.178
Around revealing
Gabriel august's identity.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.110
And obviously,
Once that happens,

53:38.115 --> 53:40.575
The demands
On liam's personal life

53:40.585 --> 53:41.615
Are going to be extreme.

53:41.619 --> 53:43.889
I just need a few more
Weeks.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.418
That's all i'm asking.

53:45.423 --> 53:48.723
[♪♪]

53:48.726 --> 53:50.986
Liam.

53:50.995 --> 53:52.225
They won't do it.

53:52.230 --> 53:53.300
I'm sorry.

53:53.297 --> 53:54.897
I fought for you
In there,

53:54.899 --> 53:56.429
But the machine
Is just too far along

53:56.434 --> 53:57.504
For them
To stop it now.

53:57.501 --> 53:58.871
The reveal
Is on for tonight.

53:58.869 --> 54:01.139
I'm really starting
To hate gabriel august.

54:01.138 --> 54:03.668
You need to talk to sophie.

54:03.674 --> 54:06.114
I'm meeting her for dinner
Tonight at 5:30.

54:06.110 --> 54:07.440
That'll be
Cutting it close.

54:07.445 --> 54:09.705
-we'll make it.
-okay.

54:12.482 --> 54:13.952
Okay, so are we clear

54:13.951 --> 54:15.281
On the plan
For later tonight?

54:15.286 --> 54:16.846
Jasper's bookloft, 7:30.

54:16.854 --> 54:18.324
Actually, make it 7:00,

54:18.322 --> 54:20.022
So my blood pressure
Doesn't get too high.

54:20.024 --> 54:21.124
I'll be there.

54:21.125 --> 54:22.685
Bad news?

54:22.693 --> 54:24.533
She's got a work meeting.
She just canceled dinner.

54:24.528 --> 54:25.958
-what are you gonna do?
-find her.

54:25.963 --> 54:29.533
I have to tell her before
I make the announcement.

54:29.533 --> 54:32.673
You call me!
Let me know how it goes.

54:33.637 --> 54:35.097
[recording]: it's sophie.

54:35.106 --> 54:37.466
Tell me what's on your mind
After the tone. [beep]

54:37.475 --> 54:39.235
Hey, sophie.
I got your text.

54:39.243 --> 54:41.743
I'm back in town.
I really need to talk to
You.

54:41.746 --> 54:43.446
Like, right away,
Face-to-face,

54:43.447 --> 54:47.077
So call me the second
You get this, okay?

54:47.084 --> 54:49.184
I know, but if he said
It was background,

54:49.186 --> 54:50.446
You got to keep
His name out of it.

54:50.454 --> 54:51.924
That's journalism 101!

54:51.922 --> 54:53.422
Yeah. Okay.

54:53.424 --> 54:56.034
Okay, let me know
How it shakes out.

54:56.027 --> 54:58.257
Sorry i couldn't
Fit you in earlier.

54:58.262 --> 55:00.602
I had to keep a reporter
From getting sued.

55:00.598 --> 55:02.128
What's up?

55:02.133 --> 55:05.173
I wanted to let you know
That today is my last day.

55:06.703 --> 55:09.243
Your last day?

55:09.240 --> 55:11.110
So you're leaving the paper
?

55:11.108 --> 55:14.208
I'm starting my own website.

55:14.211 --> 55:16.051
One where i get to do

55:16.047 --> 55:19.147
The kind of reviews
That i want to do.

55:19.150 --> 55:21.720
Can you make a living
Doing that?

55:21.719 --> 55:24.919
Well, it may
Take me a few months

55:24.922 --> 55:28.062
To get enough advertisers,
But...

55:28.059 --> 55:31.059
I'm going to give it a try.

55:31.062 --> 55:33.332
Well, i hate to lose you,
Sophie,

55:33.331 --> 55:35.001
But i have to admit,
I'm a little jealous.

55:34.999 --> 55:36.899
Having the freedom to write
About the things you love

55:36.901 --> 55:38.271
Sounds like the perfect job.

55:38.269 --> 55:39.699
So you're not angry?

55:39.704 --> 55:44.044
I hope whatever you do next
Makes you happy.

55:46.076 --> 55:48.136
Thank you for everything.

55:48.145 --> 55:50.275
Don't suppose i could

55:50.281 --> 55:52.011
Talk you into
Showing your gratitude

55:52.016 --> 55:53.216
By giving me an article

55:53.217 --> 55:54.747
On the gabriel august
Reveal tonight?

55:54.752 --> 55:56.252
I can't.

55:56.253 --> 55:59.253
I'm already covering it
For my own website.

56:00.757 --> 56:03.287
[♪♪]

56:04.461 --> 56:05.791
Call sophie.

56:29.252 --> 56:33.762
Hey. It's tabitha, right?

56:33.758 --> 56:36.158
Hey, you kind of stood me
Up.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.490
Actually, to be fair, i
Never
Said i was going to meet
You.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.896
You work with
Sophie atkinson, right?

56:40.898 --> 56:42.968
-you know sophie?
-yeah, is she here?

56:42.967 --> 56:44.667
She was,
But she just quit.

56:44.668 --> 56:46.798
Cleaned out her desk
About 20 minutes ago.

56:46.804 --> 56:48.704
[groans] do you
Know where she went?

56:48.706 --> 56:49.866
Jasper's.

56:49.874 --> 56:52.414
To find out who gabriel
August really is.

56:52.410 --> 56:54.580
Thanks.

57:03.319 --> 57:05.819
Come on...

57:05.823 --> 57:08.323

Call jackie.

57:36.153 --> 57:38.193
[phone ringing]

57:38.189 --> 57:39.959
Where are you?

57:39.957 --> 57:41.717
I'm on my way.

57:41.725 --> 57:43.025
Meet me at the back door
Of the bookstore in 5
Minutes.

57:43.027 --> 57:44.027
Okay.

57:44.028 --> 57:45.988
[♪♪]

57:59.008 --> 58:00.178
What is going on?

58:00.177 --> 58:01.307
I can't go through with it.

58:01.312 --> 58:03.082
-why?
-because she's here.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.410
Oh, you didn't tell her yet?

58:04.415 --> 58:07.215
I tried. I called, i texted,
I went to her work.

58:07.218 --> 58:08.948
She's out there.

58:08.953 --> 58:10.223
I can't let her find out
Along with everyone else.

58:10.221 --> 58:12.421
Take a deep breath.
I will handle this.

58:12.423 --> 58:14.523
Stay here.

58:16.392 --> 58:18.262
Hello, sophie.

58:18.262 --> 58:20.662
Hi, jackie!

58:20.664 --> 58:22.504
How exciting is this?

58:22.500 --> 58:23.500
Yeah, very,

58:23.501 --> 58:24.701
And a little
Terrifying too.

58:24.702 --> 58:26.972
I can imagine.

58:26.971 --> 58:29.441
Is he going to show this
Time?

58:29.440 --> 58:30.510
He's already here.

58:30.508 --> 58:32.068
It's really happening, then?

58:34.043 --> 58:37.113
Oh, i'm presuming you're
Here
To cover this for your
Paper?

58:37.114 --> 58:38.754
Not exactly.

58:38.749 --> 58:41.079
I'm not
With the daily anymore.

58:41.085 --> 58:42.475
I'm actually here

58:42.486 --> 58:44.386
Covering it
For my own website,

58:44.388 --> 58:45.818
Which just went online.

58:45.823 --> 58:47.523
Congratulations.

58:47.525 --> 58:50.185
You let me know if i
Can help in any way.

58:50.194 --> 58:51.564
Thanks.

58:51.562 --> 58:54.202
I may hold you
To that.

58:54.198 --> 58:55.728
In fact, um...

58:55.733 --> 58:59.203
How would you like to
Scoop your old paper?

58:59.203 --> 59:02.643
What are we talking,
Exactly?

59:02.640 --> 59:04.510
Um, how about

59:04.508 --> 59:08.038
The first real
Exclusive interview

59:08.045 --> 59:10.245
With the real
Gabriel august himself?

59:11.681 --> 59:13.751
Never meant to mislead
You...

59:13.751 --> 59:16.081
I hope that we can--

59:17.120 --> 59:18.790
Liam?

59:18.789 --> 59:19.919
What are you
Doing here?

59:19.924 --> 59:21.624
Oh, my gosh. You are
Not gonna believe--

59:21.625 --> 59:24.155
Gabriel august
Will be here any minute

59:24.161 --> 59:25.291
To chat with me.

59:25.296 --> 59:26.556
Jackie got me
An exclusive!

59:26.564 --> 59:28.134
I'll be quick.

59:28.132 --> 59:29.362
I just need to say

59:29.366 --> 59:31.626
What i wanted
To tell you earlier.

59:31.635 --> 59:33.535
Actually, it's what
I've wanted to tell you

59:33.537 --> 59:34.537
For a long time.

59:34.538 --> 59:36.808
Liam, what--
What's going on?

59:36.807 --> 59:38.367
You're the first thing
On my mind

59:38.375 --> 59:40.635
When i wake up in the
Morning,

59:40.644 --> 59:43.214
And the last thing i think
About
When i go to sleep,

59:43.213 --> 59:45.713
And you're in there
A lot in between, too.

59:45.716 --> 59:48.646
So, um, although it's...

59:48.652 --> 59:51.422
Way past the time
I should have told you this,

59:51.422 --> 59:53.962
Here it goes.

59:53.958 --> 59:55.288
That crowd is here for me.

59:57.026 --> 59:59.256
For you?

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.429
I'm gabriel august.

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:02.832
[laughs]

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:05.733
And i'm j.k. Rowling.
Nice to meet you.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:07.936
[jackie]: we don't want to
Keep you waiting in suspense

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.368
Any longer.

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:11.643
Ladies and gentlemen,
In a minute,

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:14.242
It will be my pleasure
To introduce to you,

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:16.514
For the very first time,

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:19.453
The real man
Behind gabriel august.

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.820
I'm sorry.

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:23.588
I didn't want you
To find out this way.

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:26.687
That's crazy to hear.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:27.690
You're serious.

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:29.421
I wanted to tell you before.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:30.556
I should have.

01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:32.161
I never meant to hurt you.

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:33.232
I promise.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.260
How could i
Have missed this?

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:35.234
Sophie, please.

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:37.232
I can't do this.

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:38.404
No, please,
Just let me explain.

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:39.942
Please talk to me.

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:41.037
Wait!

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:43.208
Sophie, i love you.

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.141
I need to leave.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:48.814
I wanted to tell you.
I swear.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.912
Here he is... Liam bradley!

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:55.554

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:58.892
I can't believe
I let this happen again.

So, sophie,
How are you holding up?

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:46.328
I'm fine.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:47.560
Really.

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:48.904
So you keep saying.

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:52.369
The new website is
Keeping me super busy.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.539
I still can't believe
He was lying to you

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:55.668
All that time.

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:57.942
I can't believe
I didn't see it.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:01.141
I mean, i told the guy
About lola.

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:03.975
You don't think he'll put
That
In some book one day, do
You?

01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:06.181
He's probably forgotten
About us already.

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:10.123
He's got plenty
To keep him busy these days.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.890
I'm not saying
That what he did was okay,

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:14.719
But i can sort of understand
It,
Given the circumstances.

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:15.885
Honey, you can't
Be serious.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:17.363
For all we know,

01:03:17.361 --> 01:03:18.431
He was just using her
To get a good review.

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:19.858
[nina]:
Or maybe he wanted her

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:21.263
To get to know him
As a normal person,

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:22.855
Not some celebrity author.

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:24.796
I-i don't know
What to say.

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:27.002
I really liked liam.

01:03:27.004 --> 01:03:29.374
Not too often
I'm wrong about people.

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:31.813
It's not your fault.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.539
It's nobody's fault
But my own.

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:36.984
I'll bring you a slice
Of lola's cobbler.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.680
That always makes things
A little better.

01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:41.023
Thanks.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:43.718
Look.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.390
I know it's been
Really rough,

01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:46.959
And if i were in
The same place,

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.687
I can't say that
I'd feel any differently,

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:50.492
But it's hard for me
To believe

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:52.294
That he didn't truly
Care about you.

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:56.866
I'm not sure
What to think anymore.

01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:59.297
But i do know one thing.

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.803
I can't go back to this.

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:08.542
Whatever we had,

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:11.375
It's over now.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:23.290
[♪♪]

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.962
Hi.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.365
I'm guessing this
Isn't a coincidence.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:10.412
Well, i remember
You telling me

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:13.407
How much you love
Forest park.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.610
That it was magical...

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:19.252
Your place to escape.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.019
And...nina told me.

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:23.819
But don't blame her.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.720
I called and practically
Begged her to help me out.

01:05:25.722 --> 01:05:27.792
I just wanted to talk
To you before i go.

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:29.621
You're leaving?

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:30.856
Going back
To new york.

01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:32.461
I can't be in portland
Without you.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:35.832
And i can't take back
Being famous now.

01:05:35.832 --> 01:05:37.572
But i've been
Thinking a lot lately

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:40.437
About how things
Went with us, and...

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:41.437
And what?

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:43.198
We both made mistakes.

01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:46.806
We each came into this
A little broken in some
Ways.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.340
But we both know

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:50.375
We've never felt this way
About anyone before.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.250
If you can find
A way to forgive me,

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.850
I know we can
Work past this.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:58.022
I do forgive you, liam.

01:05:58.021 --> 01:06:00.591
So you'll give us
Another chance?

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:08.302
Part of you
Belongs to the world now...

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.128
Whether you like it or not,

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.344
They're always
Gonna be there.

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:15.997
I did that before,

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:18.136
And you know
How badly it ended.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.081
I'm not him.

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:23.137
I'm liam bradley.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.306
And i love you.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.384
Don't.

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:28.823
I'm sorry.

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:30.919
I-i can't do this again.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:36.589
On that plane
When we first met,

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:39.063
You told me that
First star of evening

01:06:39.062 --> 01:06:40.962
Was good
Because it was honest.

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:43.404
I probably said
A lot of things.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.800
I'm sorry if i was--

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:47.001
No. No,
You were right.

01:06:47.004 --> 01:06:48.374
I've spent the last few
Years

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:50.272
Pretending that
I wasn't gabriel august,

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:51.973
That i was better than that,

01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:54.205
That i was meant
To write real novels

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:56.951
About people's real lives.

01:06:56.947 --> 01:07:00.317
But what's more real than
A love story with a sad
Ending?

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:08.055
I should go.
I have a plane to catch.

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:09.358
Goodbye, sophie.

And the next...

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:56.003
She was there,

01:07:56.006 --> 01:07:59.206
Filling the empty seat
Beside him.

Do you mind
Signing something for me?

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:23.971
Happy to.

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:28.198
You're gonna miss your cab.

Oh, there'll always be
Another one.

You're gonna like it.

That's the first time
I've heard you say that.

This isn't
Vienna sunset!

No, it isn't.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.421
And you've put your
Name as the author!

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.120
Noticed that,
Did you?

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:48.122
I know i'm not gonna
Like the answer to this,

What i should've done
Before,

01:08:58.033 --> 01:09:00.874
Written something
That's honest and real.

01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:02.371
A book that i believe in,

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:04.671
One that i am proud
To put my name on.

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:09.874
Cancel all
My appointments today.

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:14.183
And book me the first flight
Out
To portland.

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:16.537
Oregon. Thanks.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:17.746
[beep]

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:21.047
[♪♪]

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.902
I'm pretty sure the plural
Of "goose" is "geese."

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.229
It's not gooses?

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:42.698
You'd think so,
But alas.

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:43.836
You're the boss.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.070
How long until

01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:47.075
The broken truth chronicles
Review is done?

01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:49.577
Mm. You can't rush genius.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.579
So how long until

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.821
The broken truth chronicles
Review is done?

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:55.777
[doorbell chimes]

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:00.391
Jackie.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:01.920
Hello, sophie.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:04.055
This is such a surprise.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.860
I don't want to take up
Much of your time,

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:07.232
But do you have a minute?

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:08.900
This is
Really impressive.

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:10.028
It's a labor
Of love.

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:11.033
I've been
Working a lot more

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:12.234
Than i did
At the paper,

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:15.065
But i like
My boss better.

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:16.071
[laughs]

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:18.572
You okay
Otherwise?

01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:19.505
[sighs]

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:21.839
It took a while,
But...

01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:23.605
I think i am now.
I feel good.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.513
I'm happy for you.

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:29.576
It's great seeing you,
Jackie,

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:31.446
But i am guessing
There's a reason

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.594
You flew all the way
Out to portland.

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:35.660
Liam is still
In love with you, sophie.

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:39.489
Wow! You don't beat
Around the bush, do you?

01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:40.856
Well, i think it's best
To say what i mean,

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:43.334
And i think you, of all
People,
Would appreciate that.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:46.026
Did liam put you up to this?

01:11:46.036 --> 01:11:47.736
He would kill me
If he knew i was here.

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:51.208
How's he doing?

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:52.807
Better.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.679
The first few months
Were difficult.

01:11:54.678 --> 01:11:56.108
It was a lot to get used to.

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:57.852
I can imagine.

01:11:57.847 --> 01:12:00.647
Women must've been
Throwing themselves at him.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:04.550
There was only one woman
Whose opinion mattered,

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.594
And she wasn't
In new york.

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:09.089
Why are you here, jackie?

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:11.162
Liam misses you a lot.

01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:14.201
And i'm guessing
That you miss him

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:15.257
Just as much.

01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:17.065
And...

01:12:17.067 --> 01:12:18.767
I thought you'd
Want to see this.

01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:19.698
What is it?

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:21.343
His new book.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:23.098
Really?

01:12:23.106 --> 01:12:24.836
A new gabriel august book?

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.671
A new liam
Bradley book.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.736
The first,
Actually.

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:31.882
Return to forest park.

01:12:31.881 --> 01:12:33.611
He took your advice,

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:35.516
He wrote something honest,

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.618
Something he believes in.

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:39.389
His book speaks
From his heart.

01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:42.519
And he dedicated
It to...

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.885
Someone
Very special to him.

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:49.098
Take care, sophie.

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:54.938
[♪♪]

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:21.358
We finally
Put a face to gabriel
August...

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:23.004
And now you want
To kill him off?

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:27.569
Oh, i wouldn't put it
Quite that way,

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.570
That is precisely
What we want.

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:31.612
The book that he was
Contractually obligated

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:32.568
To give us

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.205
Is not
A gabriel august novel.

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:37.210
Actually, if you look
At the contract closely,

01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:38.313
I think you'll find

01:13:38.314 --> 01:13:39.654
That liam bradley
Owes you a new book,

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:41.079
Not gabriel august.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:44.554
Gabriel august
Is liam bradley.

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:45.524
Liam.

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:48.215
Where's vienna sunset?

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:50.394
The ashes might still be in
The fireplace in portland.

01:13:50.393 --> 01:13:53.393
[jackie]: i don't think
It's gonna do you much good.

01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:55.926
But we think you are gonna
Love
Liam bradley's new book.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:58.172
[liam]: ted, i understand
This is a business,

01:13:58.168 --> 01:14:02.138
And your profit
Is the bottom line, correct?

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:03.568
Correct.

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:05.643
[liam]: then i hope we have
Some good news for you.

01:14:05.642 --> 01:14:07.612
You know i'm a fan

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.180
Of test-marketing
My clients' new books.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:11.650
To be perfectly blunt,

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:13.548
I found liam's new book

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:15.950
Emotional
And incredibly gripping.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:19.592
So i commissioned
A market evaluation
Research,

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:21.459
And the results
Are in your hands.

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:26.132
It achieved the highest
Rating

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:29.059
Of any book
They've ever tested.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:31.965
You know, market research
Doesn't guarantee success.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.838
It's the book business, ted!

01:14:33.837 --> 01:14:36.267
There is no guarantee
Of success.

01:14:36.272 --> 01:14:39.872
But this is as close as it
Gets.

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:42.076
It comes down to this.

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:44.148
Gabriel august
As we all knew him

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.247
Doesn't exist anymore.

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:47.718
Liam bradley does.

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:49.047
And to be honest,

01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:51.322
I feel like
I'm just getting started.

01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:53.751
I want harris-kingsfield
Along for the ride,

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:56.456
But one way or the other...

01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:58.189
I'm still moving forward.

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:02.655
[♪♪]

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.642
I'm sorry.

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:11.368
No, it's okay.

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:13.414
I feel like
It's all my fault.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:15.979
If i hadn't introduced
You to liam,

01:15:15.979 --> 01:15:17.949
You never would've
Told him about lola.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:19.777
I can't believe

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:23.922
He wrote this
In his book.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.890
It's okay.

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:27.048
No, it's--
It's not.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:29.556
Sophie...

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:32.359
I told him it was okay.

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:34.302
Liam called me.

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:37.297
He asked
My permission.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.600
He...

01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:41.041
You talked to him?

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.537
He's a good man.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.070
I know you two had
Your problems.

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:49.075
He's a decent guy.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:51.278
He...

01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:54.251
Made me look
Handsome and sexy,

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.380
Like i told him to.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.090
How could he not?

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:01.289
So?

01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:02.591
How is it?

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:04.662
It's beautiful.

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:07.501
And smart,

01:16:07.497 --> 01:16:10.627
And funny, but so sad.

01:16:10.633 --> 01:16:12.703
Uh...

01:16:14.269 --> 01:16:15.969
It's liam.

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:22.413
When you were
Going out with james,

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.012
I kept my mouth shut.

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:26.513
Figured you knew
What you were doing

01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:27.846
Without my help.

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:31.490
You couldn't have
Been more wrong.

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:35.417
To know much
About relationships.

01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:38.185
I only loved

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.834
One woman in my life.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:43.600
You found
Your one true love.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.770
I know that now.

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.869
But when lola and i
Were together,

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:53.212
It wasn't always
So clear.

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:56.879
Loving someone's

01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:59.349
The hardest work
There is.

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:02.075
Oh, i messed up plenty,

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:03.775
So did she.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:06.816
We disappointed
Each other sometimes,

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:09.693
We said things
We regretted later,

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:13.232
But...

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:17.026
We never

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:20.973
Let that
Keep us apart,

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:26.740
No matter how bad things
Seemed at the time.

01:17:26.743 --> 01:17:36.453
It wasn't true love
Because it was easy.

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:38.522
We fought for it.

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:43.416
What am i supposed to do?

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:46.659
[sighs]

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:53.071
You're the only person
That can answer that.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.696
[♪♪]

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.141
So?

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.240
Do i finally have
A happy author?

01:18:34.243 --> 01:18:35.483
They're all
Out there for you.

01:18:35.478 --> 01:18:37.178
The real you.

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:38.380
Thanks to you.

01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:40.181
You made
All this happen.

01:18:40.183 --> 01:18:41.883
Well, that's sweet,

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:46.054
But this had very
Little to do with me.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:49.255
Your parents
Would have been so proud.

01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:50.788
You think so?

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:52.893
I know it.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:56.355
So, do i have to drag you
Kicking and screaming

01:18:56.365 --> 01:18:58.065
Out onto
The stage again?

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.597
No.

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:01.102
This time,

01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:02.804
I'm actually
Looking forward to it.

01:19:02.805 --> 01:19:04.205
Shall we?

01:19:04.207 --> 01:19:06.837
Let's go knock 'em
Dead, kiddo.

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:11.154
[crowd chatting quietly]

01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:15.418
Thank you for coming out.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.118
[applause]
Thank you.

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.787
I know this is a bit
Unusual,

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:23.890
But we have some wonderful
News
To share with you today.

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:26.363
You recently
Met this gentleman

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:29.732
As the author behind
The gabriel august novels,

01:19:29.732 --> 01:19:33.602
But today, we're here to
Talk
About an exciting new
Direction.

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:35.673
I'll let him
Tell you all about it.

01:19:35.671 --> 01:19:38.841
Ladies and gentlemen,
Liam bradley.

01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:41.781
[applauding]

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:49.583
I love writing.

01:19:49.585 --> 01:19:51.585
From as far back
As i can remember,

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:52.917
I was scribbling things
Down.

01:19:52.922 --> 01:19:54.122
I've been very fortunate

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.393
To find people like you

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:56.591
Who actually want
To read what i wrote.

01:19:56.592 --> 01:20:00.432
[applause]

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:03.059
But for too long,
I've stayed in the shadows.

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:06.225
Well, i'm happy, and...

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:09.795
Actually pretty nervous...

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:12.006
To say
That those days are done.

01:20:12.008 --> 01:20:14.738
My new book is called
Return to forest park,

01:20:14.744 --> 01:20:15.944
And as you can see,

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:18.745
The only name on it
Is mine.

01:20:18.748 --> 01:20:20.278
Yes, sir?

01:20:20.283 --> 01:20:23.583
So, are you just continuing
The gabriel august romances

01:20:23.586 --> 01:20:25.246
Under a new name?

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:26.724
Not at all.

01:20:26.722 --> 01:20:28.762
There is some romance in it,
But this book is different.

01:20:28.758 --> 01:20:30.558
It's more
A novel of discovery,

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.590
About a man
Finally finding himself.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:33.825
Is it autobiographical?

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:35.160
I refuse to answer that

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.534
On the grounds
That i may incriminate
Myself.

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:38.473
[audience chuckling]

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:40.897
Let's just say it's honest.

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:41.903
Yes, miss?

01:20:41.904 --> 01:20:42.874
Does this mean
You've walked away

01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:44.372
From your deal
With harris-kingsfield?

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:45.773
No. I'm thrilled
To be staying

01:20:45.775 --> 01:20:47.505
Under the harris-kingsfield
Umbrella.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.880
They've been
Incredibly supportive,

01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:50.638
And i look forward
To a long future together.

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:52.846
[sophie]:
Mr. Bradley, it sounds

01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:54.419
Like return to forest park

01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:57.687
Is more personal than
Your previous novels.

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.217
It does.

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:02.163
I've learned a lot
Over this past year,

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:06.388
And i hope that shows
In this new book.

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:09.325
I'd say it's the most
Personal
Book i've ever written.

01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:10.832
It must be hard,

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:15.103
Being thrust into the
Spotlight
Like this.

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:17.544
Are you worried
That it might change you?

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.470
Change isn't always
A bad thing.

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:22.135
I know i've been
Changing a lot lately.

01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:24.254
Sure, all this is
Challenging,

01:21:24.247 --> 01:21:26.207
But i've finally
Learned to be comfortable

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.515
In being liam bradley.

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:32.745
And what you see
Is what you get.

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:35.155
Can your fans count on that?

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:40.693
My fans can rest assured

01:21:40.696 --> 01:21:43.826
That i would never do
Anything
To hurt them.

01:21:43.833 --> 01:21:48.073
Because some of us still
Have
Deep-seated trust issues

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.600
That we're working through.

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:50.965
And i'd like to
Help with those

01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:53.073
Any way that i can.

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.579
[♪♪]

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.879
Are you sure
You're up for it?

01:21:58.881 --> 01:22:01.821
Absolutely.

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:04.487
It may take
A while.

01:22:04.487 --> 01:22:07.017
That's fine by me.

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.616
'Cause i hope to spend

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:11.855
Every day
For the rest of my life

01:22:11.861 --> 01:22:14.631
Showing my fans
Just how much i love them.

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:17.260
You want to get
Your camera ready.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.696
I think you're gonna want
To get a shot of this.

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:25.369
Speaking as
A big fan myself...

01:22:25.374 --> 01:22:28.814
That sounds like
A wonderful new chapter.

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:33.049
[applause]

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.615
[♪♪]

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.828
Don't worry about them.

01:22:45.828 --> 01:22:48.498
All that matters
Is right here.

01:22:48.497 --> 01:22:51.497
[♪♪]

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.613
Woohoo!

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:03.710
