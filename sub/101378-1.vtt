WEBVTT

00:26.443 --> 00:30.447
So, he flirts with you all the time
during these late-night rehearsals?

00:31.015 --> 00:31.749
No.

00:33.417 --> 00:36.253
You said he just loves to flirt,
that he's a dog.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.387
How is that my fault?

00:38.255 --> 00:39.456
Oh, so he does.

00:39.489 --> 00:40.992
No, he doesn't.

00:41.025 --> 00:47.330
Ah, so he flirts with every single
pretty girl in the world except for you.

00:50.567 --> 00:52.602
Have I ever given you any reason
to believe I would be unfaithful?

00:53.470 --> 00:54.706
No.

00:54.739 --> 00:56.774
Then don't you think I deserve
just a little bit of trust here?

00:57.474 --> 00:59.643
I wish you were never
in that stupid show.

01:00.778 --> 01:02.714
Oh, now you're attacking
the play.

01:02.747 --> 01:04.682
I'm not attacking anything.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.551
Jack, stop.

01:08.518 --> 01:10.487
We have been together
for three years

01:10.520 --> 01:14.659
and I hope to be together
forever and ever and ever and...

01:14.692 --> 01:16.794
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

01:17.527 --> 01:18.595
I do, too.

01:18.628 --> 01:19.764
Okay.

01:19.797 --> 01:22.466
Then, can we stop?

01:22.767 --> 01:24.367
Because I don't want to argue.

01:25.937 --> 01:29.539
I don't want to argue either, honey,
as long as you can admit that I'm right.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.590
<i>Dear Brett, as you probably
know, tonight's performance of Wolfgang,</i>

02:53.623 --> 02:59.797
<i>in which my amazingly talented girlfriend Lisa
performs the role of Mozart's wife Constanze,</i>

02:59.831 --> 03:02.365
<i>will be the final time the
curtain rises on this great play.</i>

03:03.167 --> 03:04.601
<i>Let us celebrate this occasion.</i>

03:05.770 --> 03:08.405
<i>Why don't you and Sarah join me
at the theater at 8:00</i>

03:08.438 --> 03:11.408
<i>and then come over to our place
for drinks after?</i>

03:11.441 --> 03:15.512
<i>Not only can we toast Lisa in her
biggest professional acting role to date,</i>

03:15.545 --> 03:18.749
<i>but also,
and I confess this to you only,</i>

03:18.783 --> 03:22.787
<i>you will be witness to quite
a momentous surprise as well.</i>

03:22.820 --> 03:25.156
<i>Looking forward
to seeing you guys.</i>

03:25.189 --> 03:27.658
<i>Your friend, Jack.</i>

03:27.692 --> 03:29.492
Lisa.

03:29.526 --> 03:30.728
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.

03:30.761 --> 03:32.629
I want to thank you all for...

03:32.663 --> 03:35.599
Thanks, guys, for coming out
tonight, Sarah, Brett.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.667
Ah.

03:37.567 --> 03:38.535
Lisa.

03:38.836 --> 03:43.674
Okay. Lisa...

03:43.708 --> 03:45.408
for the past three years
that I've known you,

03:46.643 --> 03:49.847
you're always positive,
looking toward the future.

03:51.514 --> 03:52.515
So, Lisa, honey.

03:55.219 --> 03:57.621
- Okay, that's okay.
- Wasn't it great?

03:59.690 --> 04:00.825
So great, amazing.

04:00.858 --> 04:01.759
I'm so glad you guys came.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.661
Okay, we're hugging. Okay.

04:04.594 --> 04:07.430
Yeah, we wanted to come earlier in the run.
You just get so busy.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.667
But aren't you glad you came though?
Wasn't Lisa amazing?

04:09.700 --> 04:11.501
- Lisa was so great.
- Right?

04:11.534 --> 04:12.837
Amazing. Right, Sarah?

04:14.005 --> 04:14.906
So great.

04:14.939 --> 04:16.573
Hmm.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.877
Mm?

04:22.246 --> 04:22.980
Coats?

04:23.948 --> 04:24.849
No.

04:25.950 --> 04:27.685
- Okay.
- Ah, new sofa.

04:27.718 --> 04:30.821
You know, uh, that's Lisa's.

04:30.855 --> 04:34.557
I'm gonna get rid of all this old
stuff once we get that next new payday.

04:34.591 --> 04:35.726
It should be any day now,
right, Brett?

04:36.694 --> 04:37.662
Okay.

04:39.730 --> 04:41.198
Drinks.

04:41.232 --> 04:43.200
- Hmm.
- Jack.

04:43.234 --> 04:45.535
Go ahead and pop her open,
it's a special occasion.

04:45.568 --> 04:46.469
Mm-Hm.

04:48.571 --> 04:49.907
- Woo!
- Mm-hm.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.641
- Sarah, you want some?
- Mm.

04:51.676 --> 04:54.011
I would kill someone
for a gin and tonic.

04:54.045 --> 04:59.684
I do not have any gin right now, but I do have
white wine, I did not have a chance to chill it.

05:00.685 --> 05:02.585
- Terrific.
- Mm.

05:02.619 --> 05:04.956
And boom.

05:04.989 --> 05:06.958
That play is long, isn't it?

05:06.991 --> 05:08.192
Honey.

05:08.225 --> 05:11.561
Yeah, no, she's right, it's
definitely on the longish side.

05:11.594 --> 05:13.664
It's just that,
it's past my bedtime

05:13.698 --> 05:15.866
and I have some contract
negotiations in the morning.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.568
So, we should probably
just head out.

05:18.601 --> 05:20.705
- Well, it means a lot to Lisa that you made it out
- Where's your bathroom?

05:21.638 --> 05:23.040
It's right around
the corner there.

05:28.713 --> 05:30.948
Ugh.

05:30.982 --> 05:31.949
Where is Lisa?

05:31.983 --> 05:33.784
Oh, uh, she's getting changed.

05:33.818 --> 05:37.822
- Oh, she wants to make a grand entrance.
- Yes, she is an actress.

05:39.290 --> 05:41.025
Oh...

05:42.026 --> 05:43.493
- Anyway, cheers.
- Cheers.

05:47.630 --> 05:49.700
Ooh!.

05:49.734 --> 05:51.035
Mm-Hm.

05:56.007 --> 05:59.310
- Brett, I don't want to put you on the spot again...
- Yeah.

05:59.343 --> 06:02.747
Um, but you know, this was Lisa's,
like, first real acting gig.

06:02.780 --> 06:03.914
Right.

06:03.948 --> 06:06.317
Yeah, it's not like
some student film.

06:06.350 --> 06:07.617
- Right.
- It's not an infomercial.

06:07.651 --> 06:11.554
- Right.
- Yeah, it's like a real acting work, which she loves.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.290
Well, I mean,
you were right, she was great.

06:13.324 --> 06:14.892
Yeah, but she was telling me
on the way home, she's like,

06:14.925 --> 06:17.895
"Man, I am never gonna get
another decent part again."

06:17.928 --> 06:19.030
- No.
- Yeah.

06:19.063 --> 06:20.865
She's like, "I'm gonna be
bikini girl at the pool."

06:20.898 --> 06:22.099
No.

06:22.133 --> 06:24.769
Yeah. "I'm gonna be a friend
killed by machete at the lake."

06:24.802 --> 06:25.770
No.

06:25.803 --> 06:26.771
She'll keep it going.

06:27.738 --> 06:29.572
- So great.
- Yeah.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.675
- Yeah.
- But she still doesn't have an agent.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.945
Jack, I'm strictly literary.
You know that, I don't handle actors.

06:34.979 --> 06:35.946
I handle writers.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.882
Uh, I handle great writers.

06:37.915 --> 06:39.784
Thank you.

06:39.817 --> 06:42.720
You know, I'm not comfortable
with the term genius.

06:45.222 --> 06:49.660
Anyway, so maybe you could, uh,
I don't know, at some point tonight,

06:49.693 --> 06:52.730
sit down with Lisa, talk to her,
maybe set up some meetings down the line.

06:53.964 --> 06:55.800
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.702
Of course, this is a really tough
time in the industry right now.

07:01.105 --> 07:02.840
- I'm just gonna...
- Yeah.

07:09.980 --> 07:11.849
Ah.

07:21.425 --> 07:24.862
- Am I at the right place?
- Paul?

07:24.895 --> 07:26.764
- Hey, it's Brett.
- Hey.

07:26.797 --> 07:27.765
Of course, man.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.167
We met at the thing, remember?

07:30.201 --> 07:31.669
At the play.

07:32.136 --> 07:34.071
No, at the premiere
for Jack's movie.

07:35.739 --> 07:36.974
- Right.
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

07:37.007 --> 07:38.109
This is Sarah.

07:38.142 --> 07:39.977
Sarah, so good to see you again.

07:40.010 --> 07:40.945
We don't know each other.

07:42.146 --> 07:43.114
Hi, I'm Trina.

07:43.147 --> 07:44.715
Oh, yeah, my bad.

07:44.748 --> 07:45.883
Yeah,
this is my girlfriend Trina.

07:45.916 --> 07:47.218
Trina this is...

07:48.052 --> 07:49.053
- Brett.
- Brett.

07:49.086 --> 07:49.887
Hi, I'm Trina.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.723
- And, uh, this is...
- Sarah.

07:52.756 --> 07:53.924
- This is Sarah.
- Hi, I'm Trina.

07:53.958 --> 07:55.025
- Hi.
- Hello.

08:00.998 --> 08:03.000
- You have a lovely home.
- I do not live here.

08:03.033 --> 08:04.702
Oh!

08:04.735 --> 08:07.738
Mm. I need another one.
Anybody else?

08:07.771 --> 08:09.940
Sorry, guys,
I didn't realize I had to...

08:10.908 --> 08:11.809
Paul.

08:12.443 --> 08:14.145
- Jack.
- Hi, I'm Trina.

08:15.446 --> 08:17.414
Oh, God!

08:19.049 --> 08:22.419
I'm Jack.
And can I get you a drink?

08:22.453 --> 08:25.823
- I... I'm not a huge...
- She's gotta try the bourbon. You gotta try it.

08:28.459 --> 08:29.693
Here you go.

08:33.030 --> 08:34.031
Whoa!

08:34.732 --> 08:35.432
Hey.

08:35.466 --> 08:37.034
Hey.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.936
Hello, everyone.

08:38.969 --> 08:41.038
Hey!

08:41.071 --> 08:43.174
Oh. Thank you all
so much for coming.

08:43.207 --> 08:46.043
Brett, Sarah, hi.

08:46.076 --> 08:48.112
- Paul.
- Lis.

08:48.145 --> 08:49.213
My Mozart.

08:49.246 --> 08:51.081
Oh, my Mozart.

08:51.815 --> 08:53.817
God!

08:58.255 --> 09:01.192
Right, I almost forgot.
Uh, this is my friend Trina.

09:01.225 --> 09:03.027
Oh, hi.

09:03.060 --> 09:06.830
It is so nice to meet you.

09:10.534 --> 09:12.870
- Lisa, darling, can I see you in my office, please?
- Yeah.

09:12.903 --> 09:14.471
Okay.

09:15.439 --> 09:17.174
You didn't mention
Paul was coming.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.944
- Sure, I did.
- No, you didn't.

09:20.511 --> 09:24.949
Jack, I definitely mentioned
I invited Paul.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.018
Lisa, I definitely would have
remembered if you had.

09:28.052 --> 09:29.186
Okay.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.988
Why is this a big deal?

09:31.021 --> 09:31.956
It's not.

09:31.989 --> 09:35.092
Well, it...
It certainly seems like it is.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.361
Well, it's not.

09:37.394 --> 09:42.199
And you hadn't mentioned it,
and now our guests and Paul are waiting.

09:46.570 --> 09:48.939
It's only about 12
to 14 miles per gallon

09:48.973 --> 09:51.141
and I'm like,
"I don't care. I'll take it."

09:52.576 --> 09:56.113
You're Paul's wife,
in the play thingy.

09:56.146 --> 10:00.217
- I didn't recognize you without all the big poofy hair.
- Oh!

10:00.251 --> 10:01.185
You were so good.

10:01.218 --> 10:02.953
Thank you, thank you.

10:02.987 --> 10:07.992
I love that part where you and Paul are sort
of fooling around in the palace or whatever,

10:08.025 --> 10:09.293
and you're acting
like you're a little lamb.

10:09.326 --> 10:12.196
Oh, yeah.

10:12.229 --> 10:13.530
- Baa.
- That's right.

10:13.564 --> 10:15.032
Awoo!

10:15.065 --> 10:16.133
I don't know.

10:18.068 --> 10:19.536
Baa.

10:19.570 --> 10:21.772
Baa.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.076
Awoo!

10:26.110 --> 10:27.144
Baa.

10:27.177 --> 10:30.981
appear,
a little lamby-bamby, pamby.

10:31.015 --> 10:32.049
No!

10:32.082 --> 10:33.350
I'm going to rush-crush.

10:33.384 --> 10:35.219
I'm going to gnaw-saw.

10:35.252 --> 10:39.256
I'm going to rip you into pieces
with my fang-bangs. Ah-ha!

10:39.290 --> 10:41.325
Fang-bangs. Fang-bangs.
Fang-bangs.

10:42.026 --> 10:46.563
Awoo! I descend like moonlight
unto thy pale bosom.

10:46.597 --> 10:50.901
That this could be the great Mozart
made the sting all the worse.

10:50.934 --> 10:53.904
Wow, that's Salieri's line,
how do you know that?

10:53.937 --> 10:58.876
- B-b-b-b-b-b...
- Because, unfortunately, I have a photographic memory.

10:58.909 --> 10:59.810
That's right.

11:00.611 --> 11:02.046
Imagine having an argument
with her.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.282
I felt bad for that Salieri guy.

11:06.116 --> 11:09.119
- He tries so hard, you know, he just doesn't have it.
- Yeah.

11:09.153 --> 11:12.389
Mozart acts like that
and just craps out perfection.
