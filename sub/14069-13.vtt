00:00.054 --> 00:01.672
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.673 --> 00:03.299
- What you thinking about?
- Just thinking about names.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.645
It's just that if
I'm gonna help raise them,

00:04.646 --> 00:06.046
I'd like to give them something.

00:06.081 --> 00:07.325
You're gonna be the one
who gave him his last name.

00:07.349 --> 00:09.683
My little guy--he got asthma.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.151
The window in the living room--

00:11.186 --> 00:12.986
it's been broken
for seven months.

00:13.021 --> 00:15.021
His client hasn't paid
her rent in three months.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.390
She's had no heat,
and a broken window all winter

00:17.426 --> 00:19.259
despite repeated
requests for repair.

00:19.294 --> 00:20.427
We don't have it in writing,

00:20.462 --> 00:22.529
which is what
the court requires.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.731
I'd like to request time
to confer with my supervisor.

00:24.767 --> 00:26.266
- You have to help him.
- I can't.

00:26.301 --> 00:28.101
We are requesting
permission to evict

00:28.137 --> 00:31.071
if we don't have a check
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

00:31.106 --> 00:32.939
- $3,600.
- Should be enough

00:32.975 --> 00:34.719
to cover your rent
for the last three months.

00:34.743 --> 00:35.876
I don't what to say.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.711
- This is a job offer.
- When you graduate,

00:37.746 --> 00:39.924
you're gonna have to pass
the Character of Fitness test.

00:39.948 --> 00:41.548
And you think
working at your firm

00:41.583 --> 00:43.884
looks better than
working at mine.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.396
You're gonna tell me
you had nothing to do

00:45.420 --> 00:48.421
with Harvey asking me
to help you get a law license.

00:48.457 --> 00:50.290
I wasn't even on her radar.

00:50.325 --> 00:53.260
I had one thing I wanted to do,
and you ruined it for me,

00:53.295 --> 00:54.739
just because you can't
accept the fact

00:54.763 --> 00:55.695
that I don't wanna
come back here.

00:55.731 --> 00:57.063
I wasn't trying
to get you back.

00:57.099 --> 00:58.443
I was trying to help you.
I don't believe you.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.634
Stop messing with my life!

01:27.629 --> 01:30.096
Hey. Mike,
what are you doing here?

01:30.132 --> 01:32.399
I came to apologize
for yelling at you

01:32.434 --> 01:33.800
about going to Gibbs.

01:33.836 --> 01:36.102
- You don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.038
I know you only had
my best interest at heart.

01:38.073 --> 01:41.007
You always do, and...

01:41.043 --> 01:42.509
I shouldn't have snapped at you.

01:42.544 --> 01:44.444
I shouldn't have gone to her
behind your back.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.813
That's okay.

01:46.849 --> 01:48.982
It kinda worked out.

01:49.017 --> 01:51.251
Come on in.
Let's have a drink.

01:51.286 --> 01:52.819
You can tell me all about it.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.626
You kidding me?
A legal clinic?

01:59.661 --> 02:01.061
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought Gibbs told you

02:01.096 --> 02:02.362
she'd never let that happen.

02:02.397 --> 02:03.964
Yeah, by telling people
I was a fraud.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.710
Turns out the one guy
who knew I was a fraud

02:05.734 --> 02:07.767
from years ago
runs the clinic.

02:07.803 --> 02:09.169
Not only was he
willing to hire me,

02:09.204 --> 02:10.704
he was happy about it.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.272
Seems like crime does pay.

02:12.307 --> 02:16.009
You bet your ass it does.

02:16.044 --> 02:17.577
What?
You're never gonna believe it,

02:17.613 --> 02:20.914
but they have me supervising
this third-year law student.

02:20.949 --> 02:22.315
She thinks she knows
more than me.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.985
- You mean you have a you.
- She is so much worse than me.

02:25.020 --> 02:25.986
Is she constantly
talking about

02:26.021 --> 02:27.520
what a great memory she has?

02:27.556 --> 02:29.489
Dresses shitty?
She have man purse?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.124
Are you done?

02:31.159 --> 02:33.260
Why? You have
someplace you gotta be?

02:33.295 --> 02:34.728
Actually,
I am supposed to stay away

02:34.763 --> 02:37.130
from our apartment for awhile.

02:37.165 --> 02:39.232
So anyway, I said to Louis,
"I don't care

02:39.268 --> 02:41.601
"if most of the associates
start in the bullpen.

02:41.637 --> 02:44.871
I'm not giving up
my office."

02:44.907 --> 02:48.041
That's great, Rachel, but I'm
on my third glass of Chardonnay,

02:48.076 --> 02:49.487
and I don't think
you called me over here

02:49.511 --> 02:51.878
to tell me you submitted
your application to the Bar,

02:51.914 --> 02:54.047
or that you're putting
your foot down with Louis.

02:54.082 --> 02:56.082
You're right.

02:56.118 --> 02:59.319
I called you over here
to tell you that...

02:59.354 --> 03:01.388
I put my foot down with Mike.

03:01.423 --> 03:04.291
You finally told him to pick
a hairstyle and stick with it?

03:04.326 --> 03:05.759
No.

03:05.794 --> 03:08.461
I finally told him

03:08.497 --> 03:10.897
that he made me a promise
before he went away,

03:10.933 --> 03:13.466
and now that he's back

03:13.502 --> 03:15.702
and gainfully employed,

03:15.737 --> 03:20.140
it's time for him to make
an honest woman of me.

03:20.175 --> 03:24.210
Rachel,
I'm so happy for you.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.212
And the answer's yes.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.714
What answer?

03:27.749 --> 03:30.216
I didn't ask you a question yet.
Yes, you did,

03:30.252 --> 03:33.186
and I'd be thrilled to be
your maid of honor.

03:33.221 --> 03:35.422
Thank you, Donna.

03:35.457 --> 03:37.424
Mike, that's great.

03:37.459 --> 03:39.159
I'm happy for you.

03:39.194 --> 03:40.827
Still up for being
my best man?

03:40.862 --> 03:42.362
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

03:42.397 --> 03:44.164
We going back to the church?

03:44.199 --> 03:46.533
No, we're gonna do it
at our place this time.

03:46.568 --> 03:48.101
No, you can't do that.

03:48.136 --> 03:50.236
Yeah, we just wanna keep it
small, intimate.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.172
I understand, but what kinda
best man would I be

03:52.207 --> 03:53.847
if I didn't offer for you
to have it here?

03:53.875 --> 03:56.743
Pretty shitty one
if you ask me.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.812
So basically
you came here to apologize,

03:58.847 --> 04:00.091
so you didn't have to
get married

04:00.115 --> 04:01.614
at your shitty
little apartment.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.383
You think that I'd ask you
to be my best man

04:03.418 --> 04:07.187
if we had a better location?

04:07.222 --> 04:09.089
Congratulations.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.323
Thanks, Harvey.

04:12.194 --> 04:13.760
Now all we need to do
is make sure

04:13.795 --> 04:16.363
you don't skip out on this one.
Yeah, it's funny.

04:16.398 --> 04:17.608
We also need to make sure
that you don't--

04:17.632 --> 04:19.099
--Donna at the wedding.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.533
- What did you just say?
- Huh?

04:20.569 --> 04:21.579
You got something
caught in your throat?

04:21.603 --> 04:22.586
No, I'm all good.

We're celebrating.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.089
Louis, you know
I can't have champagne.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.191
I know, which is why
we're having

05:11.227 --> 05:13.327
the best sparkling apple cider
money can buy.

05:13.362 --> 05:15.596
Well, in that case...

05:15.631 --> 05:16.964
What are we celebrating?

05:16.999 --> 05:20.200
The fact that it's
your first sonogram this week.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.770
Louis, about the sonogram...

05:22.805 --> 05:26.140
Joshua asked
if he could be there.

05:26.175 --> 05:28.575
- What?
- He's the baby's father.

05:28.611 --> 05:30.177
He wants to be in its life.

05:30.212 --> 05:31.445
Or wants to be in your life.

05:31.480 --> 05:35.616
Louis,
I chose you over him.

05:35.651 --> 05:37.284
You don't have to be
worried about that.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.887
And if you want me to say
he can't be there for this,

05:39.922 --> 05:41.355
then I will,

05:41.390 --> 05:44.058
but he asked me, and I thought
it was a fair request,

05:44.093 --> 05:45.392
so I'm asking you.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.730
Yeah, he can be there.

05:52.201 --> 05:54.168
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm not,

05:54.203 --> 05:56.070
but I know it's
the right thing to do.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.442
Thank you.

06:05.348 --> 06:06.880
Um, excuse me,
I just need to--

06:06.916 --> 06:08.716
Oh, hello, Benjamin.

06:08.751 --> 06:11.018
Have you come to manipulate
my hard drive?

06:11.053 --> 06:12.386
Debug my processor?

06:12.421 --> 06:14.254
Reboot my motherboard?

06:14.290 --> 06:17.491
Please, I just need to
update your VOX in peace.

06:17.526 --> 06:19.471
If I wanted my VOX updated,
I'd be talking to someone

06:19.495 --> 06:21.862
with a lot more
experience than you.

06:21.897 --> 06:24.231
Ms. Paulsen,
I know you know this

06:24.266 --> 06:26.333
but I will remind you
for the 37th time--

06:26.369 --> 06:28.102
that VOX is our computer's
operating system,

06:28.137 --> 06:29.777
and it needs to be updated
once a quarter.

06:29.805 --> 06:31.205
Once a quarter?

06:31.240 --> 06:32.973
What, are we married?

06:33.008 --> 06:35.409
'Cause I got news for you.
This main frame

06:35.444 --> 06:37.122
needs a new memory stick
a hell of a lot more than

06:37.146 --> 06:39.580
once a quarter.
That's it. I'm finished.

06:39.615 --> 06:41.482
I would walk you through
the hard restart,

06:41.517 --> 06:43.061
but I'm afraid you'd focused
on all the wrong words

06:43.085 --> 06:44.718
in that sentence.
No, right now

06:44.754 --> 06:47.554
I'm just focused on the fact
that you're finished.

06:47.590 --> 06:48.555
Now leave your money
on the table,

06:48.591 --> 06:49.890
so I can watch you walk away.

06:54.096 --> 06:55.562
Mmm!

06:55.598 --> 06:57.965
Mind telling me
what that was all about?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.933
You mean me making
sexually suggestive comments

06:59.969 --> 07:02.002
to our IT guy?
He has a name, you know.

07:02.037 --> 07:04.505
I do, but I'd be shocked
if you knew what it was.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.306
That's not the point.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.575
No, Harvey,
the point is,

07:08.611 --> 07:10.210
I'm not doing
anything to him,

07:10.246 --> 07:11.779
I'm doing it for him.

07:11.814 --> 07:13.747
And how exactly
do you figure that?

07:13.783 --> 07:16.116
I figure that,
because Benjamin updates

07:16.152 --> 07:18.018
everybody else's
computers remotely,

07:18.053 --> 07:20.053
and once a quarter
he's down here,

07:20.089 --> 07:21.755
pretending not to like my act,

07:21.791 --> 07:24.491
so unless you want me to focus
my rapier-like wit on you,

07:24.527 --> 07:26.226
I suggest you walk
your pretty little self

07:26.262 --> 07:28.162
back into your office.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.864
Benjamin.
I knew it.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.332
No, you didn't.

07:40.276 --> 07:42.242
Mike, thank God you're here.

07:42.278 --> 07:43.710
Sofia Price just called.

07:43.746 --> 07:45.891
She's been in the hospital
since last night with her son.

07:45.915 --> 07:47.714
- Is he okay?
- I think so, for now.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.995
It was an asthma attack, but
she wanted me to tell you that--

07:50.019 --> 07:51.430
She couldn't drop off
the check for her rent.

07:51.454 --> 07:52.686
Damn it, um...

07:52.721 --> 07:54.087
Call her back.
Tell her I'm on it.

07:54.123 --> 07:56.156
Mike, wait.

07:56.192 --> 07:59.126
You covered what she owed
with your own money, didn't you?

07:59.161 --> 08:00.405
Because that's above and beyond.

08:00.429 --> 08:02.062
We can talk about
how awesome I am later.

08:02.097 --> 08:03.575
Right now, I need to
make sure that Sofia's rent

08:03.599 --> 08:05.766
is paid by 10:00.

08:08.604 --> 08:10.904
Louis,
can I talk to you?

08:10.940 --> 08:12.773
Of course.

08:12.808 --> 08:14.141
I--I don't even know
what to do.

08:14.176 --> 08:17.144
My hands are shaking.
Rachel, what's going on?

08:17.179 --> 08:18.879
I'm not getting into the Bar.

08:18.914 --> 08:22.616
- What? That's ridiculous.
- Read this.

08:22.651 --> 08:24.852
After careful
review of your application,

08:24.887 --> 08:25.897
the Character
and Fitness committee

08:25.921 --> 08:27.299
will not be granting you
an interview?

08:27.323 --> 08:28.689
This is bullshit!
I know,

08:28.724 --> 08:30.268
because I knew I was gonna
have to defend myself,

08:30.292 --> 08:31.937
but I didn't think
I wasn't even gonna have

08:31.961 --> 08:33.427
the chance to defend myself.

08:33.462 --> 08:35.395
- Okay, calm down.
- How can I calm down?

08:35.431 --> 08:37.130
This is exactly
what my dad was afraid of.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.909
He said that they'd hold
my relationship with Mike

08:38.933 --> 08:39.967
against me.

08:40.001 --> 08:41.313
You don't know
this is about Mike.

08:41.337 --> 08:43.937
Of course it's about Mike.
What--

08:43.972 --> 08:46.073
what else would it be about?
It could be a mix-up,

08:46.108 --> 08:47.541
some kind of clerical error.

08:47.576 --> 08:49.643
You could've filled out
the paperwork wrong.

08:49.678 --> 08:51.845
I went over it ten times.

08:51.881 --> 08:53.680
Rachel, there is
an explanation for this,

08:53.716 --> 08:54.826
and I'm gonna get to
the bottom of it.

08:54.850 --> 08:57.551
- You don't know that.
- Look at me.

08:57.586 --> 09:01.622
I promise you will get
your interview, okay?

09:01.657 --> 09:02.956
Okay.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.998
Harvey, we have a problem.

09:11.033 --> 09:13.634
What is it?

09:13.669 --> 09:15.380
This is about Mike.
Of course it's about Mike.

09:15.404 --> 09:16.414
That's why I came
here the second

09:16.438 --> 09:17.838
Rachel left my office.

09:17.873 --> 09:19.451
- What'd you tell Rachel?
- What do you think I told her?

09:19.475 --> 09:20.986
I told her that it must be
some kind of mistake,

09:21.010 --> 09:22.153
but you and I
both knows it's not,

09:22.177 --> 09:23.355
which means
you need to fix this.

09:23.379 --> 09:26.246
Yeah, I do need to fix it,
and I will.

09:26.282 --> 09:29.016
Normally,
instead of coming to me,

09:29.051 --> 09:30.717
you'd go full steam ahead
and do something

09:30.753 --> 09:32.786
that makes the situation
significantly worse.

09:32.821 --> 09:34.821
Possibly.
What are you getting at?

09:34.857 --> 09:38.225
Why did you come to me?

09:38.260 --> 09:39.993
Because we said
we'd run this firm together,

09:40.029 --> 09:41.072
and if we're gonna do that,

09:41.096 --> 09:42.374
then I have to
be honest with myself

09:42.398 --> 09:43.975
of what I'm good at
and what you're good at.

09:43.999 --> 09:46.500
And you know I'm better at
this kinda thing than you are?

09:46.535 --> 09:48.035
I do.

09:48.070 --> 09:49.536
Louis,
that shows real growth.

09:49.572 --> 09:51.605
Thank you, Harvey.
And it shows growth on your part

09:51.640 --> 09:53.318
not to make light of the fact
that I just admitted

09:53.342 --> 09:55.442
something that was...

09:55.477 --> 09:57.578
very difficult for me to admit.

09:57.613 --> 09:59.391
You mean that I'm better
at everything than you.

09:59.415 --> 10:00.492
- That's not what I said.
- Too bad,

10:00.516 --> 10:02.849
because that's what I heard.

10:02.885 --> 10:04.418
Okay, Harvey, seriously,

10:04.453 --> 10:06.253
this is not about you
having fun with me.

10:06.288 --> 10:07.955
This is about Rachel.

10:07.990 --> 10:10.257
I know it is,
and if I weren't confident

10:10.292 --> 10:11.525
that I could take care of it,

10:11.560 --> 10:12.904
I wouldn't be
giving you a hard time

10:12.928 --> 10:14.428
for admitting
how much better I am

10:14.463 --> 10:16.196
at everything than you.
God damn it.

10:16.231 --> 10:18.966
Sorry, Louis, gotta go be
better at something.

10:19.001 --> 10:20.200
See you later.

10:29.144 --> 10:31.144
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.145
My name's Mike Ross.

10:32.181 --> 10:34.281
I'm here on behalf of
Sofia Price,

10:34.316 --> 10:36.683
and this is every dime of rent
she owes your client.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.052
And why exactly are you
bringing that to me?

10:39.088 --> 10:40.665
Because you're an attorney,
not a landlord,

10:40.689 --> 10:42.689
and I don't want there to be
any misunderstandings.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.826
What I understand
is that it's 10:18,

10:45.861 --> 10:47.260
and your client had till 10:00.

10:47.296 --> 10:48.440
You have got to be
shitting me.

10:48.464 --> 10:50.097
I most certainly am not,

10:50.132 --> 10:51.810
and maybe your client
should have thought of that

10:51.834 --> 10:53.934
before not paying her rent
all those months.

10:53.969 --> 10:55.614
You think I don't know
what's going on here?

10:55.638 --> 10:57.315
You're trying to get her out,
so that you can get this place

10:57.339 --> 10:58.450
out from under rent control,

10:58.474 --> 10:59.651
but I'm not gonna let you
get away with it.

10:59.675 --> 11:00.907
No, what's going on here

11:00.943 --> 11:03.243
is that my client is sick of
having a troublemaker,

11:03.278 --> 11:05.746
who doesn't pay her rent,
as a tenant.

11:05.781 --> 11:07.814
Listen to me,
you cannot evict her now.

11:07.850 --> 11:09.683
Her son is in the hospital.

11:09.718 --> 11:10.951
I have a job to do.

11:10.986 --> 11:14.021
Now, I am sorry about
your client's son,

11:14.056 --> 11:15.389
but the court was very clear,

11:15.424 --> 11:17.724
and there's nothing more
that I can do.

11:23.732 --> 11:25.332
Mike, what happened?

11:25.367 --> 11:26.867
Got there 18 minutes late.

11:26.902 --> 11:29.002
What does it matter?
You had three months back rent.

11:29.038 --> 11:30.782
They wanna kick her out
to get out of rent control,

11:30.806 --> 11:31.983
and now that we've missed
the deadline,

11:32.007 --> 11:33.218
there's nothing
we can do about it.

11:33.242 --> 11:34.841
Wrong, there is.

11:34.877 --> 11:36.721
I got to thinking--why would
they be in such a hurry

11:36.745 --> 11:39.646
to evict somebody who can
actually come up with the money?

11:39.682 --> 11:40.825
They're not just trying to
get her out.

11:40.849 --> 11:41.960
They're trying to
get everyone out.

11:41.984 --> 11:43.483
Exactly.

11:43.519 --> 11:44.829
They're gonna demolish
that whole building.

11:44.853 --> 11:46.931
I was over there last night.
The workers were already there,

11:46.955 --> 11:48.488
which means
they've already started.

11:48.524 --> 11:50.557
I get it. You wanna hit 'em
with a countersuit.

11:50.592 --> 11:52.032
I wanna nail their asses
to the wall.

11:52.061 --> 11:53.501
Now you guys get to work
on the suit.

11:53.529 --> 11:55.607
I'm gonna go talk to Nathan
about stopping Sofia's eviction

11:55.631 --> 11:59.766
from happening in the meantime.
Mike.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.269
You don't need to go to Nathan.
I can handle this.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.071
- Listen, I appreciate that--
- I get it.

12:04.106 --> 12:05.639
I shit the bed the other day.

12:05.674 --> 12:07.207
- Oliver--
- Look, Mike.

12:07.242 --> 12:09.676
I admit, sometimes I get
flustered in court.

12:09.712 --> 12:11.578
But the law's clear on this.
It's a layup.

12:11.613 --> 12:13.425
If we have a pending lawsuit,
it puts an automatic hold

12:13.449 --> 12:14.881
on the eviction.

12:14.917 --> 12:16.516
I'm telling you
I can handle this.

12:16.552 --> 12:18.652
Please, let me make up
for the other day.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.689
Well, what are you
waiting for?

12:22.725 --> 12:23.857
Get your ass down to court.

12:23.892 --> 12:25.659
Let me know
as soon as it's done.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.283
All right, Benjamin,
playtime's over.

12:31.319 --> 12:32.696
What the hell did you do
to my computer?

12:32.720 --> 12:34.053
I didn't do anything to it,

12:34.088 --> 12:35.432
other than increase
its performance.

12:35.456 --> 12:37.000
If that's your idea of
increasing performance,

12:37.024 --> 12:38.502
then you ought to
rethink your career,

12:38.526 --> 12:39.903
because that thing
has crashed more times

12:39.927 --> 12:43.462
than Mel Gibson on his way home
from a Saturday night.

12:43.498 --> 12:45.197
Wait a second,
are you smiling?

12:45.233 --> 12:46.276
Of course not.
You're yelling at me.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.366
Why would I be smiling?

12:47.401 --> 12:48.846
Don't bullshit
a bull-shitter, Benjamin.

12:48.870 --> 12:51.370
You're up to something, and you
better come clean right now.

12:51.405 --> 12:53.439
Okay.
I was hoping to do this

12:53.474 --> 12:55.141
in a more formal
environment, but...

12:59.447 --> 13:02.248
Allow me to introduce
The Donna.

13:02.283 --> 13:03.749
What the hell is that?

13:03.785 --> 13:05.317
It's a digital version of you,

13:05.353 --> 13:07.253
with approximately
10,000 of your best quotes,

13:07.288 --> 13:09.321
witticisms, and zingers,
packed into five gigahertz

13:09.357 --> 13:10.990
of computing power.

13:11.025 --> 13:12.970
That's why you've been
personally updating my computer

13:12.994 --> 13:14.193
and nobody else's?

13:14.228 --> 13:15.405
Yes, I've been
secretly recording you

13:15.429 --> 13:16.507
for the better part of
two years.

13:16.531 --> 13:18.664
Two years?

13:18.699 --> 13:20.099
Why me?

13:20.134 --> 13:22.112
Because everyone always wishes
they could say the right thing

13:22.136 --> 13:23.447
at the right time,
and you are the one woman

13:23.471 --> 13:26.105
in the universe who says
the right thing every time.

13:26.140 --> 13:27.551
Now to mention,
you are without a doubt

13:27.575 --> 13:30.776
the most amazing legal secretary
in the history of everything.

13:30.812 --> 13:31.989
Benjamin,
that's the sweetest thing

13:32.013 --> 13:33.345
anyone's ever said to me.

13:33.381 --> 13:35.748
Okay, but you said it
about yourself two weeks ago.

13:35.783 --> 13:38.150
- That I did.
- In that case,

13:38.186 --> 13:39.730
Donna Paulsen,
I wasn't gonna ask you this

13:39.754 --> 13:41.465
for another few weeks,
but how would you feel about

13:41.489 --> 13:46.091
pursuing this with me
as a business opportunity?

13:46.127 --> 13:47.760
Let me think about it.

13:47.795 --> 13:49.862
But first, let me borrow
that thing for a few days.

13:59.373 --> 14:00.784
Wanna tell me
why you're playing games

14:00.808 --> 14:04.643
with my associate's
admission to the Bar?

14:04.679 --> 14:06.245
- You're Harvey Specter.
- In the flesh,

14:06.280 --> 14:08.592
and if I don't walk out of here
with an appointment in my hand,

14:08.616 --> 14:09.893
you're gonna find out
what that means,

14:09.917 --> 14:13.586
because Rachel Zane
deserves to make her case.

14:13.621 --> 14:14.587
Rachel Zane.

14:14.622 --> 14:16.422
This is clearly
a scheduling error.

14:16.457 --> 14:18.257
Sorry.
I will, uh,

14:18.292 --> 14:20.826
set her interview for
two weeks from today.

14:20.862 --> 14:22.539
I'd say thank you,
but you should've done that

14:22.563 --> 14:24.029
in the first place.

14:24.065 --> 14:25.698
I don't think
she's gonna pass, though.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.646
- What'd you say?
- I just thought you should know

14:29.670 --> 14:30.636
the vote has to be unanimous

14:30.671 --> 14:32.271
among the members of
the committee,

14:32.306 --> 14:34.173
and I have a sense that

14:34.208 --> 14:36.575
at least one
isn't gonna say yes.

14:36.611 --> 14:38.143
Well, you could've
just rejected her,

14:38.179 --> 14:39.556
but you went to the trouble
to get me down here,

14:39.580 --> 14:41.881
so get to it.

14:41.916 --> 14:45.751
Well, I'm just saying...

14:45.786 --> 14:48.787
that if someone were to, say,

14:48.823 --> 14:50.589
sue my biggest competitor

14:50.625 --> 14:53.926
for enough money so that
their stock price plummets,

14:53.961 --> 14:56.629
perhaps Ms. Zane's chances would
take a turn for the better.

14:56.664 --> 14:58.063
Let me get this straight,

14:58.099 --> 14:59.698
you're on the Ethics Committee,

14:59.734 --> 15:01.700
and you're asking me to do
something illegal.

15:01.736 --> 15:02.746
It's not illegal
if you can find

15:02.770 --> 15:04.103
a legitimate reason to sue them.

15:04.138 --> 15:05.349
Then there's gotta be
more to the story,

15:05.373 --> 15:06.516
or you wouldn't be
calling me in here,

15:06.540 --> 15:08.540
blackmailing me into doing this.

15:08.576 --> 15:10.276
The more to the story is,

15:10.311 --> 15:12.044
you have a history of
ethical ambiguity,

15:12.079 --> 15:13.579
and that's what this requires.

15:13.614 --> 15:15.948
And you're either gonna do it,
or you're not.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.717
Either way, like I said,

15:18.753 --> 15:20.986
Ms. Zane's interview
is in two weeks.

15:28.863 --> 15:31.430
Reckless endangerment?
Is this a joke?

15:33.367 --> 15:35.801
I guarantee you,
Sofia Price isn't laughing.

15:35.836 --> 15:37.703
Well,
any judge in his right mind

15:37.738 --> 15:38.949
is gonna laugh you out of court,

15:38.973 --> 15:40.539
because you don't
understand the law.

15:40.574 --> 15:41.919
No, you're the one
that doesn't understand the law,

15:41.943 --> 15:43.375
Ms. Johnson.

15:43.411 --> 15:45.622
You started demolition with
tenants still in your building.

15:45.646 --> 15:47.491
You sent a three-year-old
to the emergency room.

15:47.515 --> 15:50.582
You pursue this, I'm going
straight after the mother,

15:50.618 --> 15:52.451
and I'll turn her into
the negligent party,

15:52.486 --> 15:54.119
and she'll be lucky
to keep her son.

15:54.155 --> 15:55.399
You do that,
and I'll show the court

15:55.423 --> 15:57.389
that you filed construction
plans with the city,

15:57.425 --> 15:58.702
claiming that
the building was empty,

15:58.726 --> 16:01.093
which is punishable
under the criminal code.

16:01.128 --> 16:05.164
No, Mr. Ross,
you won't show them anything.

16:05.199 --> 16:06.932
He will.

16:06.968 --> 16:08.412
Did you think I wouldn't
check up on you

16:08.436 --> 16:11.036
when all of a sudden,
a Queens legal clinic

16:11.072 --> 16:13.272
starts acting like
a Midtown law form.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.840
Well, I did.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.142
And if this goes to trial,

16:17.178 --> 16:18.288
he's the one I'm up against,

16:18.312 --> 16:20.846
and we all know
what happened last time.

16:20.881 --> 16:23.093
You wouldn't be here if that's
all you wanted to tell me.

16:24.585 --> 16:25.595
So why don't you
give me a number,

16:25.619 --> 16:27.119
and I'll take it to my client.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.054
$10,000.
Not a penny more.

16:29.090 --> 16:30.968
You see, all my experience
at a Midtown law firm

16:30.992 --> 16:32.469
tells me you're authorized
to go to 20,

16:32.493 --> 16:34.660
so let's say 25
and call it a day.

16:34.695 --> 16:36.362
$25,000?

16:36.397 --> 16:38.464
Criminal charges, Linda.

16:38.499 --> 16:40.265
So if I were you,
I'd cut that check,

16:40.301 --> 16:41.934
consider it a bargain,
and hope to hell

16:41.969 --> 16:44.103
that little boy
doesn't get worse.

16:53.714 --> 16:55.214
Hey, any luck?

16:55.249 --> 16:57.182
Depends on your
definition of the word.

16:57.218 --> 16:59.718
I met with the asshole
that sent the letter to Rachel.

16:59.754 --> 17:01.131
Let me guess,
you couldn't convince him

17:01.155 --> 17:03.422
to give her an interview.
No, I got her the interview,

17:03.457 --> 17:05.089
but the vote has to unanimous,

17:05.126 --> 17:07.358
and he's putting
a price on his vote.

17:07.395 --> 17:08.493
What does he want?

17:08.529 --> 17:09.994
He wants us
to fabricate a lawsuit

17:10.031 --> 17:11.896
against his biggest competitor.
Jesus Christ,

17:11.932 --> 17:13.643
that's not an ask,
that's a criminal action.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.568
You think I don't know that?

17:16.604 --> 17:19.505
Okay, Harvey, if we find
a legitimate suit,

17:19.540 --> 17:20.740
it doesn't have to be illegal,

17:20.775 --> 17:22.019
which means,
under the circumstances,

17:22.042 --> 17:23.619
maybe it's worth doing.
I'm not doing shit

17:23.644 --> 17:25.243
until I know
the full story on this guy.

17:25.279 --> 17:27.057
Harvey, this is Rachel's
future we're talking about.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.525
Yeah, I know it is,
but I'm telling you

17:28.549 --> 17:29.681
this isn't all he wants,

17:29.717 --> 17:31.061
and I'm not going to
agree to anything

17:31.085 --> 17:33.185
until I know
what the hell it really is.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.787
Well, what are we gonna do?

17:34.822 --> 17:38.490
I'm not doing anything.
You are.

17:38.526 --> 17:39.858
I don't understand.

17:39.894 --> 17:41.527
Louis, you were man enough
to admit to me

17:41.562 --> 17:42.639
that I'm better at
fixing things.

17:42.663 --> 17:44.241
Well, you're better at
something than me,

17:44.265 --> 17:46.131
and it's called
financial transactions.

17:46.167 --> 17:48.434
I appreciate that, Harvey,
but what does that matter?

17:48.469 --> 17:49.902
This guy's doing this
to drive down

17:49.937 --> 17:53.472
someone's stock price,
and I wanna know why.

17:53.507 --> 17:55.707
I'll take care of it.

17:55.743 --> 17:57.643
What do we tell Rachel?

17:57.678 --> 17:59.812
The truth--
that it was a mix-up,

17:59.847 --> 18:01.747
but now she's got
a date on the books.

18:01.782 --> 18:04.583
And you and I need to
fix this before then.

18:10.691 --> 18:12.858
Sofia.

18:12.893 --> 18:14.426
How is he?
He's okay.

18:14.462 --> 18:16.428
They said he should get out
in a couple of days.

18:17.965 --> 18:19.364
I have some good news.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.433
We can stay in our place?

18:21.469 --> 18:22.835
No.

18:22.870 --> 18:26.872
But you have a month
to find a new place,

18:26.907 --> 18:30.909
and a check for $25,000
to help you find it.

18:33.914 --> 18:36.949
Mr. Ross, I'm grateful for
everything you've done,

18:36.984 --> 18:40.018
but Marissa told me that
if we could prove

18:40.054 --> 18:41.231
what happened to AJ
is their fault,

18:41.255 --> 18:42.654
they'd have to pay.

18:42.690 --> 18:44.490
They are paying.

18:44.525 --> 18:47.826
Shouldn't they pay at least
enough for his treatment?

18:47.862 --> 18:49.895
His injections
next year are gonna be

18:49.930 --> 18:51.763
$25,000 right there.

18:51.799 --> 18:54.266
Sofia, going to court
is always risk.

18:56.904 --> 18:59.104
Our lives have been
one risk after another.

18:59.140 --> 19:02.674
This check isn't a risk.
This is real money.

19:05.779 --> 19:07.713
How much could we get
if we win?

19:07.748 --> 19:10.249
Absolute best case--
$500,000--

19:10.284 --> 19:14.586
but I'm telling you--
Please, Mr. Ross.

19:14.622 --> 19:17.422
They did this to him,

19:17.458 --> 19:21.193
and if we have a chance
to change his life,

19:21.228 --> 19:22.995
we need to take it.

19:26.901 --> 19:28.200
Okay.

19:34.642 --> 19:36.608
Louis, can I help you?

19:39.013 --> 19:41.380
I was just thinking about
when I stood here years ago,

19:41.415 --> 19:42.714
and I had to tell you

19:42.750 --> 19:45.184
that you weren't gonna
get into Harvard.

19:45.219 --> 19:47.286
You thought you'd
never be a lawyer,

19:47.321 --> 19:50.689
but I knew you'd find a way.

19:50.724 --> 19:52.257
You got me my interview.

19:52.293 --> 19:55.694
I did.

19:55.729 --> 19:58.797
Turns out...

19:58.832 --> 20:01.633
It was just a mix-up.

20:01.669 --> 20:05.737
Thank you, Louis.

20:05.773 --> 20:09.274
Do you think I'm still gonna
have to defend myself

20:09.310 --> 20:11.577
about my relationship with Mike?

20:11.612 --> 20:14.413
I don't know, Rachel,

20:14.448 --> 20:15.959
but I do know we're gonna do
whatever it takes

20:15.983 --> 20:17.816
to make sure
you become a lawyer.

20:38.110 --> 20:41.045
I'm seeing someone.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.281
These aren't for you.
They're for my fiancée.

20:44.317 --> 20:46.461
But if it'll get you to close
this deal, you can keep 'em.

20:46.485 --> 20:48.285
I'll just buy her
another bouquet.

20:48.321 --> 20:50.654
- I already closed this deal.
- Turns out you didn't.

20:50.690 --> 20:53.057
- That is bad faith.
- Circumstances changed.

20:53.092 --> 20:55.359
What the hell changed
between today and tonight?

20:55.394 --> 20:57.928
My client found out that
her son needs more treatment,

20:57.964 --> 20:59.363
which means
she needs more money.

20:59.398 --> 21:01.143
I think what happened
is your client's seeing

21:01.167 --> 21:02.766
an opportunity for
a bigger payday,

21:02.802 --> 21:04.134
and you can't control her.

21:04.170 --> 21:06.337
Well, what you think
doesn't really matter.

21:06.372 --> 21:09.006
If you don't raise
your offer to $100,000,

21:09.041 --> 21:11.542
we're going to court.
Are you out of your mind?

21:11.577 --> 21:12.710
This isn't Wall Street.

21:12.745 --> 21:14.089
We don't give out
that kind of money.

21:14.113 --> 21:15.457
If you lose,
you're going to be giving out

21:15.481 --> 21:17.159
a hell of a lot more than that.
And if I agree to this,

21:17.183 --> 21:21.385
you'll be right back here
tomorrow, asking for more.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.354
Look, I'm telling you,

21:23.389 --> 21:24.855
I can get her to agree to this.

21:24.890 --> 21:26.523
And I am telling you,

21:26.559 --> 21:28.470
you've had your offer.
That's all your gonna get,

21:28.494 --> 21:30.828
and if you don't take it
right now, we're going to trial,

21:30.863 --> 21:33.530
and I am gonna
wipe the floor with this kid.

21:33.566 --> 21:34.743
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.433
Listen to me,
if you think

21:36.469 --> 21:37.869
you're gonna pull
some kind of trick

21:37.903 --> 21:39.370
to get you to be able to

21:39.405 --> 21:41.839
sit next to him
and hold his hand,

21:41.874 --> 21:43.507
there's no way
that's gonna happen,

21:43.542 --> 21:45.509
because you were deemed a fraud,

21:45.544 --> 21:47.155
and no judge in the world
is gonna let you

21:47.179 --> 21:49.580
turn his court into a joke.

21:56.622 --> 21:59.623
Jesus Christ,
Harvey's handwriting is so bad,

21:59.659 --> 22:01.892
he makes my doctor
look like a calligrapher.

22:01.927 --> 22:03.105
<i>You're telling me, sister.</i>

22:03.129 --> 22:04.261
<i>That handwriting's sloppier</i>

22:04.296 --> 22:05.863
<i>than Mel Gibson</i>
<i>on a Saturday night.</i>

22:05.898 --> 22:08.098
Holy shit,
you can adjust my phrases

22:08.134 --> 22:10.212
- to the situation at hand?
<i>- Of course I can.</i>

22:10.236 --> 22:11.802
<i>Who do you think</i>
<i>you're dealing with?</i>

22:11.837 --> 22:13.771
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>I just incorporated</i>

22:13.806 --> 22:15.539
<i>"holy shit" into</i>
<i>my vocabulary right now.</i>

22:15.574 --> 22:17.352
No way, that had to have
already been in there.

22:17.376 --> 22:19.154
<i>Well, look who</i>
<i>finally showed up to the party.</i>

22:19.178 --> 22:20.878
<i>"The Party,"</i>
<i>written by, produced by,</i>

22:20.913 --> 22:23.213
<i>and starring The Donna.</i>

22:23.249 --> 22:24.548
I like the way you think.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.583
<i>Of course you do.</i>
<i>I'm you.</i>

22:26.619 --> 22:29.787
- And you know what you are?
- Awesome.

22:29.822 --> 22:31.355
Hey.

22:31.390 --> 22:32.601
You want to take a coffee break?

22:32.625 --> 22:33.635
<i>I think we've earned it.</i>

22:33.659 --> 22:34.892
Yeah.
Me too.

22:34.927 --> 22:35.859
<i>And none of that Keurig shit</i>

22:35.895 --> 22:36.895
<i>that Gretchen likes.</i>

22:36.929 --> 22:38.762
<i>Fresh brewed, or nothing.</i>

22:38.798 --> 22:40.998
When did you get so sassy?

22:44.403 --> 22:45.936
Harvey, good, you're here.

22:45.971 --> 22:48.472
I got your message.
Did you find something?

22:48.507 --> 22:49.507
You tell me.

22:53.612 --> 22:56.413
Explains a lot, doesn't it?
It does.

22:56.449 --> 22:58.015
Good work.
I'll take it from here.

22:58.050 --> 22:59.961
- Wait, where are you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

22:59.985 --> 23:01.563
I'm gonna see that asshole
and set him straight.

23:01.587 --> 23:02.853
But I ordered you a sandwich--

23:02.888 --> 23:04.700
turkey, no mayo, extra pickles,
like you like it.

23:04.724 --> 23:06.557
Do you want me to fix
Rachel's problem or not?

23:06.592 --> 23:08.992
I do.
It's just...

23:09.028 --> 23:10.594
I thought we could talk.

23:10.629 --> 23:11.995
What do you mean talk?

23:12.031 --> 23:13.842
Harvey, please, I need to
talk to you man-to-man.

23:13.866 --> 23:16.300
It's not about business.

23:16.335 --> 23:18.635
Did you really get me
extra pickles?

23:18.671 --> 23:20.304
Donna once told me
that's what you like.

23:22.641 --> 23:25.042
Okay, Louis,
I got a few minutes.

23:29.415 --> 23:31.582
You really can tell
if it's fresh brewed or not?

23:31.617 --> 23:33.684
<i>Please,</i>
<i>this isn't my first rodeo.</i>

23:33.719 --> 23:36.286
You're telling me.

23:36.322 --> 23:38.122
Donna, could I talk to you
for a second?

23:38.157 --> 23:40.557
<i>Of course you can.</i>
<i>What do you need, hot pants?</i>

23:40.593 --> 23:42.526
What--what is that?

23:42.561 --> 23:44.194
It's a device
called The Donna

23:44.230 --> 23:47.131
that Benjamin's working on,
and it's awesome.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.398
Go ahead, ask it something.

23:48.434 --> 23:49.800
I don't wanna
ask it something.

23:49.835 --> 23:51.235
I wanna ask you something.

23:51.270 --> 23:52.736
No, that's the whole point.
It is me.

23:52.772 --> 23:54.516
<i>If by you, you mean</i>
<i>much better than you.</i>

23:54.540 --> 23:55.906
See?
What did I tell you?

23:55.941 --> 23:57.741
Donna, I'm serious.

23:57.777 --> 23:59.343
Look, this is
a really cute joke,

23:59.378 --> 24:01.979
but can I please just have
a conversation with my friend?

24:02.014 --> 24:05.282
<i>If by friend,</i>
<i>you mean--</i>

24:05.317 --> 24:07.851
Of course you can, Rachel.

24:07.887 --> 24:08.887
What do you need?

24:11.023 --> 24:12.723
So let me
get this straight,

24:12.758 --> 24:14.202
you're in love with a woman
that you've known

24:14.226 --> 24:17.361
for about ten minutes.
She's having another man's baby,

24:17.396 --> 24:20.330
and yet, you're gonna marry her,
and raise it as your own.

24:20.366 --> 24:21.366
In a nutshell.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.644
What exactly
do you want from me?

24:22.668 --> 24:24.201
I need your advice.

24:24.236 --> 24:25.647
The guy's gonna be at
the sonogram tomorrow,

24:25.671 --> 24:27.037
and I'm afraid
I may cause a scene.

24:27.072 --> 24:29.306
Louis, I don't understand
what you're coming to me for.

24:29.341 --> 24:32.609
What do I know about--
Here, this is why.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.178
Yeah, you get it?

24:34.213 --> 24:36.446
This is why I'm coming to you.

24:36.482 --> 24:38.081
Oh, he's good-looking.

24:38.117 --> 24:39.216
He's not just good-looking.

24:39.251 --> 24:41.185
He's a goddamn
Renaissance statue.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.786
And I need to know
what he's thinking.

24:42.822 --> 24:45.322
Louis, I don't speak
for all handsome men.

24:45.357 --> 24:46.924
What do you see
when you look at me?

24:46.959 --> 24:48.125
What?

24:48.160 --> 24:49.604
I wanna know what you see
when you look at me.

24:49.628 --> 24:51.139
Right now, be honest.
Say the first three things

24:51.163 --> 24:52.563
that pop into your head.

24:52.598 --> 24:55.332
- Teeth, nose, teeth.
- God damn it! Be serious.

24:55.367 --> 24:56.567
I am being serious.

24:56.602 --> 24:59.136
Well, you know what--

24:59.171 --> 25:00.938
Never mind.
I shouldn't have come to you.

25:00.973 --> 25:02.906
Louis, it doesn't
matter what I see.

25:02.942 --> 25:04.641
What matters is
what this woman sees,

25:04.677 --> 25:06.376
and she obviously
sees something,

25:06.412 --> 25:08.378
or she wouldn't be with you.

25:08.414 --> 25:09.646
She'd be with him.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.493
Look, I appreciate that,
Harvey, but you know me.

25:11.517 --> 25:13.283
I'm gonna be in
the same room as him,

25:13.319 --> 25:15.485
looking at an image of
what he made with her.

25:15.521 --> 25:17.921
How do I not lose my shit?

25:17.957 --> 25:19.990
You're right.
It is his baby.

25:20.025 --> 25:21.458
But it's yours too.

25:21.493 --> 25:26.096
And you're gonna want it to have
as much love as it possibly can,

25:26.131 --> 25:29.399
and that means having a good
relationship with its father,

25:29.435 --> 25:32.836
because there's nothing
more important than family.

25:32.872 --> 25:34.605
You're right.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.206
Thank you, Harvey.

25:40.546 --> 25:44.281
Hey, Mike.
How's it going out there?

25:44.316 --> 25:45.682
What can I do for you?

25:45.718 --> 25:47.038
I want you to take
a look at this.

25:50.489 --> 25:51.555
Let me get this straight,

25:51.590 --> 25:53.423
you want Oliver
to petition the court

25:53.459 --> 25:56.560
to let Marissa argue his case.
Yes, I do.

25:56.595 --> 25:58.428
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- Why not?

25:58.464 --> 25:59.641
'Cause he's
a full-fledged attorney,

25:59.665 --> 26:00.775
and she's a third-year
law student.

26:00.799 --> 26:01.899
He gets flustered in court.

26:01.934 --> 26:03.400
And she's never even
been to court.

26:03.435 --> 26:05.080
I'm telling you that I don't
think that he can handle this.

26:05.104 --> 26:07.271
She can, and this woman's
future is on the line.

26:07.306 --> 26:08.705
Then convince her
to take the deal.

26:08.741 --> 26:12.042
She doesn't want the deal.

26:12.077 --> 26:14.811
Putting me in a hell of
a spot here, Mike.

26:14.847 --> 26:17.681
Nathan, you hired me
for a reason.

26:17.716 --> 26:18.927
You told me to run
the associates,

26:18.951 --> 26:19.951
and I'm running them.

26:19.985 --> 26:23.020
Now, are you gonna let me
do that or not?

26:23.055 --> 26:24.821
You're gonna do it, do it,

26:24.857 --> 26:26.990
but you're gonna be
the one to tell Oliver.

26:35.209 --> 26:38.044
You wanted to see me?

26:38.080 --> 26:40.180
Yeah, I, uh--I did.
Come in.

26:40.215 --> 26:42.883
I want to talk to you about
the, uh, Sofia Price case.

26:42.918 --> 26:44.596
Great, because I actually
wanted to tell you about

26:44.620 --> 26:48.889
five similar cases in New Jersey
that won huge settlements.

26:48.924 --> 26:52.058
That's good work,
and we can use that.

26:52.094 --> 26:54.127
But listen, I need you
to do something for me.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.669
You want Marissa
to be first chair.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.404
I think it's for the best.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.673
Mike, I know why you think
this is the right choice,

27:06.708 --> 27:08.542
but I can do this.
I'm sorry, Oliver,

27:08.577 --> 27:09.910
but at this point
in your career,

27:09.945 --> 27:11.344
I don't think you can.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.612
- Mike.
- Oliver--

27:12.648 --> 27:14.648
you said it yourself--
you get flustered in court.

27:14.683 --> 27:17.184
I know that, but if
I'm going to be a real lawyer,

27:17.219 --> 27:19.164
I have to get better in trial,
and the only way to do that

27:19.188 --> 27:20.865
is to get back on the horse.
And I'm telling you

27:20.889 --> 27:22.167
that when the right case
comes along,

27:22.191 --> 27:24.191
I promise
I will let you do that,

27:24.226 --> 27:26.726
but this is not the case.

27:26.762 --> 27:27.828
This one's Marissa's,

27:27.863 --> 27:30.997
and I need to know
you have her back.

27:31.033 --> 27:33.099
I do.

27:33.135 --> 27:34.201
Good.

27:35.838 --> 27:37.804
I'll go tell her.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.073
You don't have to
do that, Oliver.

27:40.108 --> 27:42.142
Yes, I do.

27:42.177 --> 27:43.188
It's better for the clinic

27:43.212 --> 27:45.212
if she thinks I have
confidence in her,

27:45.247 --> 27:48.281
not that you don't have
confidence in me.

28:00.195 --> 28:02.262
- You're back.
- You better believe I'm back,

28:02.297 --> 28:03.808
because I looked into
what you're doing

28:03.832 --> 28:05.165
and why you're doing it.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.611
There's really not much
to find, Mr. Specter.

28:06.635 --> 28:08.101
Well, let me
lay it out for you.

28:08.136 --> 28:10.537
Velocity Data Solutions
stole your technology,

28:10.572 --> 28:12.172
and they're
rushing it to market,

28:12.207 --> 28:14.574
so you want to
orchestrate a takeover

28:14.610 --> 28:17.444
and get back what's yours.
That sound about right?

28:17.479 --> 28:21.348
My company is gonna go under,
because of what they did.

28:21.383 --> 28:22.883
People are gonna
lose their jobs.

28:22.918 --> 28:23.950
Then go to the FBI.

28:23.986 --> 28:25.185
- I can't.
- Why not?

28:25.220 --> 28:26.286
Because I can't.

28:26.321 --> 28:27.687
Yeah, I'll tell ya
why you can't.

28:27.723 --> 28:30.223
Because a squeaky
clean guy like you

28:30.259 --> 28:33.560
doesn't come to a guy like me
unless he's got no choice,

28:33.595 --> 28:35.629
and you need me
a hell of a lot more

28:35.664 --> 28:37.509
than I need you,
so why don't you give me a call

28:37.533 --> 28:39.332
when you're ready
to tell the truth.

28:43.839 --> 28:45.972
They got it from me.

28:46.008 --> 28:48.174
I'm listening.

28:48.210 --> 28:50.310
I had an affair.

28:50.345 --> 28:53.947
I was stupid and careless,
and she got access to my laptop.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.048
And you're married,

28:55.083 --> 28:56.917
and your wife
can't find out about it,

28:56.952 --> 28:58.885
and that's why
you can't go to the FBI.

28:58.921 --> 29:00.554
There, now you know.

29:00.589 --> 29:04.491
What I know is Rachel Zane
deserves to be in the Bar,

29:04.526 --> 29:06.893
so you're not only gonna
stop blocking her,

29:06.929 --> 29:08.428
you're gonna run
interference for her

29:08.463 --> 29:09.629
if someone else does.

29:09.665 --> 29:10.808
I don't have
the power to do that.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.343
Bullshit.
You had the power to stop it,

29:12.367 --> 29:13.878
and you better believe
that you can turn it

29:13.902 --> 29:16.136
the other direction.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.538
And in return,
you'll do what I want.

29:18.574 --> 29:20.006
No.

29:20.042 --> 29:23.476
You're gonna do it, because it's
the right thing to do.

29:23.512 --> 29:26.813
But I'll do what you want
for something else.

29:32.487 --> 29:36.323
I need to talk to you.

29:36.358 --> 29:37.657
What's going on?

29:37.693 --> 29:40.393
Oliver just gave me
all the case files for Sofia.

29:40.429 --> 29:44.097
He said I'm the one
who should bring this home.

29:44.132 --> 29:46.099
Yeah, I know.

29:46.134 --> 29:48.001
We talked about it,
and I agree with him.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.170
Mike, I know this wasn't
Oliver's idea.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.438
It was yours.

29:51.473 --> 29:52.973
'Cause you don't
think he's ready.

29:53.008 --> 29:54.808
Which is why I'm coming to you.

29:54.843 --> 29:57.986
- Marissa, you can handle this.
- I know I can,

29:58.021 --> 30:01.156
but the problem is
I can't do it.

30:01.191 --> 30:02.590
What are you talking about?

30:06.096 --> 30:09.230
Um, my father's been sick,

30:09.266 --> 30:12.600
and I haven't talked about it,
because I don't like to...

30:12.636 --> 30:15.770
But now he needs surgery,

30:15.806 --> 30:17.772
and I put in for
the time off weeks ago,

30:17.808 --> 30:19.641
and I have to be there for him,

30:19.676 --> 30:21.209
but now that
I'm telling you this,

30:21.244 --> 30:23.156
I'm thinking maybe I could
fly back a few days early,

30:23.180 --> 30:24.145
or I could get there
a day later--

30:24.181 --> 30:25.847
Stop, stop, stop.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.784
It's okay.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.821
- I wanna help Sofia, Mike.
- I know you do.

30:32.856 --> 30:35.056
But you need to be
with your father.

30:37.494 --> 30:39.194
What are you gonna do?

30:39.229 --> 30:41.029
I'll figure something out.

30:55.245 --> 30:57.112
Donna, hey,
how did you like the--

30:57.147 --> 30:59.014
It's a no.

30:59.049 --> 31:00.582
What do you mean it's a no?

31:00.617 --> 31:04.085
I mean it's a cute joke,
but I'm not interested

31:04.121 --> 31:06.254
in pursuing it as
a business opportunity.

31:06.289 --> 31:08.390
I don't understand.
I thought you liked the idea.

31:08.425 --> 31:10.392
I did, but that was
before I realized

31:10.427 --> 31:14.329
that it was nothing but
quippy lines and sassy remarks.

31:14.364 --> 31:16.031
But that's who you are.

31:16.066 --> 31:17.532
No, Benjamin.

31:17.567 --> 31:18.800
That's part of who I am,

31:18.835 --> 31:20.313
and that's the only part
you've ever seen,

31:20.337 --> 31:22.281
but that's because we don't
really know each other.

31:22.305 --> 31:25.440
But if we did, you'd know that
what really makes me special

31:25.475 --> 31:28.810
is my intuition and my empathy

31:28.845 --> 31:30.712
and my heart,

31:30.747 --> 31:33.715
and this doesn't have
any of that, so...

31:33.750 --> 31:37.352
I'm sorry,
but it's a no.

31:44.428 --> 31:45.627
Mike.

31:45.662 --> 31:47.140
I'd love to chat right now,
but I can't.

31:47.164 --> 31:50.031
I'm actually going to a movie
for a change.

31:50.067 --> 31:52.100
Yeah, I just need a second.

31:52.135 --> 31:54.903
What's up?

31:54.938 --> 31:58.239
I need you to argue
the Price case tomorrow.

31:58.275 --> 31:59.719
What'd you just ask me?
Because it sounded like

31:59.743 --> 32:01.643
you want me to take the case
that you begged me

32:01.678 --> 32:03.445
to give to Marissa.
I did give it to her,

32:03.480 --> 32:05.947
but you didn't tell me
that her father had surgery.

32:05.982 --> 32:08.550
Because I didn't know
her father had surgery.

32:08.585 --> 32:10.185
She put in for it.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.397
And I don't pay attention
to that shit.

32:11.421 --> 32:13.955
Give it back to Oliver.
I told you he'll lose.

32:13.990 --> 32:16.825
Then he'll lose.
Now I'm sorry, but I have to go.

32:16.860 --> 32:18.237
God damn it,
this is a woman's life,

32:18.261 --> 32:19.572
and you're going to
a goddamn movie.

32:19.596 --> 32:21.396
What the hell is wrong with you?

32:21.431 --> 32:23.665
Are you f--

32:23.700 --> 32:25.333
Listen, we work in a clinic.

32:25.368 --> 32:27.513
Every one of our client's lives
is hanging by a thread,

32:27.537 --> 32:29.337
and if they lose,
they're out on the street,

32:29.372 --> 32:31.706
they don't get the surgery,
or they get deported.

32:31.741 --> 32:32.807
That's life.

32:32.843 --> 32:34.476
And I haven't had a life
in five years,

32:34.511 --> 32:36.077
which is why I hired you,

32:36.113 --> 32:37.912
so don't you ever
say that to me again.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.452
Look, Oliver's the kind of
lawyer we get here.

32:44.488 --> 32:47.355
If he can't handle it,
he can't handle it.

32:47.390 --> 32:49.524
That's how it goes.

32:49.559 --> 32:50.703
Then I wanna
petition the court

32:50.727 --> 32:53.128
to sit at the table with him.

32:53.163 --> 32:54.462
No.

32:54.498 --> 32:56.397
We can ask for
a special exemption, and--

32:56.433 --> 32:57.398
And I said no, all right?

32:57.434 --> 32:58.678
You're not
an officer of the court.

32:58.702 --> 33:00.746
They will not grant it,
and that is not your place here.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.048
Then at least I can
sit near him, and I can--

33:02.072 --> 33:03.571
You hear me right now!

33:03.607 --> 33:05.540
I gave you a chance,
because I needed it,

33:05.575 --> 33:07.876
but if you risk
the reputation of this clinic

33:07.911 --> 33:10.778
over one housing case,
I will fire you

33:10.814 --> 33:11.991
and make sure that
you are banned from

33:12.015 --> 33:15.583
ever sitting foot
in a courtroom again.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.285
Is that clear?

33:19.356 --> 33:22.123
Is that clear?
Yes.

33:22.159 --> 33:23.558
It's clear.

33:31.401 --> 33:33.134
This is a nice place
you got here.

33:33.170 --> 33:34.180
When are they condemning it?

33:34.204 --> 33:35.414
What are you
doing here, Harvey?

33:35.438 --> 33:37.772
I need to talk to you.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.707
Now's not a good time.
I gotta figure out how--

33:39.743 --> 33:42.110
What if I told you
I have a way

33:42.145 --> 33:44.479
to get you into the Bar?

33:44.514 --> 33:46.447
What?

33:46.483 --> 33:48.183
Someone came to us
trying to play games

33:48.218 --> 33:50.718
with Rachel's Character
and Fitness interview and--

33:50.754 --> 33:51.964
Wait, what--what the hell
are you talking about?

33:51.988 --> 33:53.254
Relax, I handled it,

33:53.290 --> 33:56.157
but now we have a chance
to get you in.

33:57.594 --> 34:00.295
What's the catch?

34:00.330 --> 34:01.296
Mike...

34:01.331 --> 34:02.297
Harvey, there are
no free lunches.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.265
What's the catch?

34:04.301 --> 34:05.711
We need to come up
with a lawsuit against

34:05.735 --> 34:08.670
Velocity Data Solutions
to drive their stock price down.

34:08.705 --> 34:10.838
Are you kidding me?
No.

34:10.873 --> 34:12.618
What do you mean no?
What--what's wrong with you?

34:12.641 --> 34:14.520
What's wrong with me is
I don't particularly feel like

34:14.543 --> 34:16.543
going back to prison,
and the last time I checked,

34:16.580 --> 34:19.080
fabricating a lawsuit to
manipulate a stock is illegal.

34:19.114 --> 34:21.382
It's not illegal
if we find a legitimate suit.

34:21.418 --> 34:22.495
That is such bullshit

34:22.518 --> 34:24.518
that we'd just be
telling ourselves that,

34:24.554 --> 34:25.731
just like we told
ourselves we weren't

34:25.755 --> 34:26.821
colluding with Cahill.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.056
And that got you
out of prison,

34:28.091 --> 34:29.157
so let's finish the job,

34:29.192 --> 34:30.369
and get you back to
being a lawyer.

34:30.393 --> 34:32.493
Harvey, I'm more a lawyer now
than I ever was.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.762
Oh, bullshit, you're
a babysitter and you know it.

34:34.797 --> 34:37.232
Hey, I'm doing what I wanted,
and I'm helping people,

34:37.266 --> 34:38.706
so if you wanna
call me a babysitter,

34:38.735 --> 34:40.935
you go right ahead, but
right now the house is on fire,

34:40.971 --> 34:41.936
the kids are in the bedroom,

34:41.972 --> 34:43.471
and I'm about to
goddamn save them.

34:43.505 --> 34:46.474
Mike, we have
an opportunity right now.

34:46.509 --> 34:48.141
It's not gonna
present itself again.

34:48.178 --> 34:50.578
I appreciate that, Harvey.

34:50.614 --> 34:52.914
I do.

34:52.949 --> 34:55.416
But I'm telling you,
my answer is no.

34:59.786 --> 35:01.420
Hey, what's going on?

35:01.455 --> 35:03.689
What's the emergency?
Where's Marissa?

35:03.724 --> 35:05.958
Marissa's gone.

35:05.993 --> 35:07.593
What do you mean gone?

35:07.628 --> 35:10.062
I mean that you're
first chair tomorrow,

35:10.097 --> 35:11.664
and we need to get you ready.

35:11.699 --> 35:13.032
What?

35:13.067 --> 35:15.000
- Oliver, it's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

35:15.036 --> 35:17.803
We can't risk having me
mess up in court again.

35:17.838 --> 35:19.650
This case is too important.
You know how I know that?

35:19.674 --> 35:22.908
Because you told me.
I know what I said.

35:22.944 --> 35:24.944
But we don't have time
to find anyone else.

35:24.979 --> 35:25.945
The trial's tomorrow.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.546
Now, are we gonna
do this thing or not?

35:32.587 --> 35:35.988
It happened at
my first mock trial.

35:36.023 --> 35:38.757
I was so prepared.

35:38.793 --> 35:39.858
And then trial started,

35:39.894 --> 35:42.161
and the other side
threw a wrinkle in.

35:42.196 --> 35:44.763
And I thought I could
think on my feet,

35:44.799 --> 35:47.366
but all of a sudden,
I felt everyone watching me,

35:47.401 --> 35:51.403
and my mouth went dry,
and my mind went blank,

35:51.439 --> 35:52.805
and I froze.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.840
Oliver...

35:54.875 --> 35:56.175
we can get through
this together.

35:56.210 --> 35:59.311
Except now you told me
I can't handle it,

35:59.347 --> 36:01.213
and that's gonna be
boring a hole in my brain,

36:01.249 --> 36:03.215
making this thing
a thousand times harder.

36:03.251 --> 36:05.651
Well, I can't
take back what I said,

36:05.686 --> 36:07.920
but what I can do
is stay here all night

36:07.955 --> 36:10.222
to make sure you prove me wrong.

36:13.928 --> 36:15.561
I don't know.

36:15.596 --> 36:19.098
Yes, you do.

36:19.133 --> 36:23.469
I want you to say it.

36:23.504 --> 36:25.504
We're gonna win this.

36:25.539 --> 36:27.072
We're going to win this.

36:27.108 --> 36:28.707
Say it again.

36:28.743 --> 36:30.142
We're going to win this.

36:30.177 --> 36:32.978
One more time,

36:33.014 --> 36:35.247
but this time mean it.

36:35.283 --> 36:38.017
We are going to win this.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.731
Now, the first thing
they're gonna do

36:40.755 --> 36:43.856
is file a motion to dismiss.
Actually, they already did.

36:46.093 --> 36:49.094
Good.
Let's work on that.

36:59.540 --> 37:01.507
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

37:01.542 --> 37:03.742
I had to stop off
and get Joshua a present,

37:03.778 --> 37:05.355
'cause I wanted to welcome him
into the family.

37:05.379 --> 37:07.346
Louis, that is so sweet,

37:07.381 --> 37:09.915
but it turns out
Joshua can't make it.

37:09.950 --> 37:11.483
What do you mean
he can't make it?

37:11.519 --> 37:13.619
He was gonna fly in,
but something came up with work,

37:13.654 --> 37:17.256
so he canceled his flight.

37:17.291 --> 37:19.091
What the hell
kind of father is that?

37:19.126 --> 37:20.592
- Louis--
- This is bullshit.

37:20.628 --> 37:21.860
It's his flesh and his blood,

37:21.896 --> 37:24.163
and if he's gonna be father,
he needs to be a father.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.564
What are you talking about?

37:25.599 --> 37:27.611
You didn't even want him
to be here in the first place.

37:27.635 --> 37:29.268
Well, I want him here now.

37:29.303 --> 37:31.136
Louis, I thought you were

37:31.172 --> 37:32.938
a more forgiving
person than this.

37:32.973 --> 37:34.818
And I thought you wanted
our baby to have a relationship

37:34.842 --> 37:36.442
with its biological father.

37:36.477 --> 37:38.711
And he's going to.

37:38.746 --> 37:40.612
But if you're gonna get
this worked up

37:40.648 --> 37:43.082
about something like this,

37:43.117 --> 37:47.720
it makes me think
I don't really know you.

37:47.755 --> 37:51.156
Louis, can you honestly tell me
that you really know me?

37:51.192 --> 37:52.991
Are we ready
to take a picture?

37:57.765 --> 38:01.033
No, I don't.

38:01.068 --> 38:04.670
And now I feel like
I'm ruining this, so...

38:04.705 --> 38:07.139
if you don't want me
to come in with you, I won't.

38:07.174 --> 38:10.542
Maybe it's best
if I just do this myself.

38:19.387 --> 38:22.121
Your Honor, this incident
occurred three nights ago,

38:22.156 --> 38:24.223
yet the boy has
a history of asthma,

38:24.258 --> 38:26.492
proving one has nothing
to do with the other.

38:26.527 --> 38:27.860
These hospital records show

38:27.895 --> 38:31.063
friable construction
material in his lungs.

38:31.098 --> 38:33.065
How did it get there?
It could have gotten there

38:33.100 --> 38:34.800
from a hundred different places.

38:34.835 --> 38:37.770
This case is based
entirely on speculation,

38:37.805 --> 38:39.204
and it should be dismissed.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.240
This case is based on
the fact that your client

38:41.275 --> 38:42.674
started construction
while tenants

38:42.710 --> 38:43.787
were still in the building,

38:43.811 --> 38:45.155
in violation of
the Real Estate Code.

38:45.179 --> 38:47.813
And what if I told you
Ms. Price signed off this?

38:47.848 --> 38:50.082
I'd say that's not possible,
because she didn't.

38:50.117 --> 38:52.518
Well, you've got documents,

38:52.553 --> 38:54.119
and I have one too.

38:54.155 --> 38:56.188
This is a copy of
a certified letter

38:56.223 --> 38:58.557
from my client
to the remaining tenants

38:58.592 --> 38:59.725
three weeks ago,

38:59.760 --> 39:01.693
stating that
construction will begin,

39:01.729 --> 39:04.797
giving fair warning
to the occupants.

39:04.832 --> 39:06.498
Your Honor, my client's
never seen that.

39:06.534 --> 39:08.333
Well, she might not
have seen it,

39:08.369 --> 39:10.536
but she got it.
It doesn't mean she opened it,

39:10.571 --> 39:11.703
or--or even read it.

39:11.739 --> 39:13.316
According to the city,
that doesn't matter.

39:13.340 --> 39:15.274
Building Code 305-A:

39:15.309 --> 39:17.342
"Tenants are required
to be notified

39:17.378 --> 39:19.945
of all construction
by certified letter."

39:19.980 --> 39:21.814
Is this a certified letter
or not?

39:21.849 --> 39:23.527
God damn it,
Oliver, say it's inadmissible.

39:23.551 --> 39:24.583
Yes, it is, but--

39:24.618 --> 39:25.929
So you admit that
she was notified,

39:25.953 --> 39:30.856
and therefore my client should
be absolved of all liability.

39:30.891 --> 39:33.058
I--I don't--I--

39:40.701 --> 39:41.900
Objection!

39:41.936 --> 39:44.036
Your Honor, this is
the fraudulent attorney

39:44.071 --> 39:45.804
I spoke with you about
before trial.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.640
We ask that he either
refrain from speaking,

39:48.676 --> 39:50.008
or be removed from the court

39:50.044 --> 39:52.211
with an immediate ruling
for the defense.

39:52.246 --> 39:53.645
Request granted.

39:53.681 --> 39:55.981
Sir, open your mouth
in my courtroom again,

39:56.016 --> 39:58.750
and you will be removed,
and this case will be dismissed.

39:58.786 --> 40:00.452
Mr. Grady,
do you have an objection

40:00.488 --> 40:02.321
to Ms. Johnson's
statement or not?

40:04.425 --> 40:07.192
I don't.
I'm sorry, I don't.

40:07.228 --> 40:08.460
Then the court has no choice

40:08.496 --> 40:10.362
but to dismiss this case
with prejudice.

40:18.005 --> 40:20.305
Benjamin, before you ask,
I already told you--

40:20.341 --> 40:22.574
What if I could make it
more like you?

40:22.610 --> 40:23.610
What do you mean?

40:23.644 --> 40:24.821
You said what
makes you special

40:24.845 --> 40:26.289
is your intuition, your empathy,
and your heart.

40:26.313 --> 40:28.213
What if I could
make it have that?

40:28.249 --> 40:29.681
How could you
possibly do that?

40:29.717 --> 40:31.027
The same way
I gave it the ability

40:31.051 --> 40:32.596
to learn from your quips,
I might be able to give it

40:32.620 --> 40:34.152
the ability to learn
from your heart,

40:34.188 --> 40:37.456
but it would require your help.

40:37.491 --> 40:39.358
You really think
we could do that?

40:39.393 --> 40:43.095
I don't know,
but I know we can try.

40:43.130 --> 40:45.964
Well, then the first thing
that you need to learn

40:46.000 --> 40:49.701
is never, ever, ever
sit in my chair.

40:49.737 --> 40:51.103
Oh, I'm sorry, I--I was--

40:51.138 --> 40:53.672
Relax, Benjamin,
I'm just messing with you.

40:53.707 --> 40:55.385
- Oh.
- But get out of my chair.

40:55.409 --> 40:56.375
Yeah.

41:08.822 --> 41:13.258
Louis, what--
what are you doing here?

41:13.294 --> 41:16.194
I need to bring you
a few things.

41:16.230 --> 41:19.665
What is all that?

41:19.700 --> 41:22.634
High school yearbooks,
childhood photo albums,

41:22.670 --> 41:24.636
and six out of seven
of the highlight reels

41:24.672 --> 41:26.638
my mother shot of us growing up.

41:26.674 --> 41:28.607
What happened to the seventh?

41:28.642 --> 41:31.276
Oh...
summer of D&D.

41:31.312 --> 41:33.278
And if it's all the same to you,

41:33.314 --> 41:35.280
I would like to still
be able to have sex again.

41:39.053 --> 41:40.619
Louis--
You were right.

41:40.654 --> 41:43.188
We don't know everything
about each other,

41:43.223 --> 41:46.625
but that just means we need to
get to know each other better,

41:46.660 --> 41:49.995
and what better way
to get to know each other

41:50.030 --> 41:53.632
then by preparing to bring
our child into the world?

41:55.703 --> 41:57.903
Louis, if this is
your reaction

41:57.938 --> 42:00.105
to what we went through today,

42:00.140 --> 42:02.841
I feel like I know you
better already.

42:04.878 --> 42:07.846
Speaking of what
we went through today,

42:07.881 --> 42:09.681
how'd it go?

42:09.717 --> 42:11.850
Why don't you take me home,

42:11.885 --> 42:13.986
and I'll tell you all about it.

42:17.691 --> 42:19.291
Harvey, can I talk to you
for a second?

42:19.326 --> 42:20.859
Sure, Rachel.
What's going on?

42:20.894 --> 42:22.194
It's about my interview with

42:22.229 --> 42:23.762
the Character
and Fitness committee.

42:23.797 --> 42:25.797
- What about it?
- Louis tried to lie to me.

42:25.833 --> 42:27.766
He said it was
some sort of mix-up,

42:27.801 --> 42:30.469
but when I asked Donna about it,

42:30.504 --> 42:32.437
she told me that
you were the one

42:32.473 --> 42:36.108
who went to see that man for me,
not Louis.

42:36.143 --> 42:39.444
Look, Harvey, it's okay,
you can tell me.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.013
It was about Mike,
wasn't it?

42:41.048 --> 42:44.383
No, it was about leverage.

42:44.418 --> 42:45.517
What do you mean?

42:45.552 --> 42:47.152
The guy holding up
your interview

42:47.187 --> 42:48.598
was trying to get us
to do something,

42:48.622 --> 42:50.622
because he thought he could.

42:50.658 --> 42:52.157
Are you going to?

42:52.192 --> 42:55.861
Yes.
He is.

42:55.896 --> 42:58.263
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

42:58.298 --> 42:59.231
Yeah.

43:02.169 --> 43:03.368
I'm in.
