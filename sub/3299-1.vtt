20:54.211 --> 20:55.920
Technically they can.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.421
They just don't
have muscle control

20:57.422 --> 21:01.217
until I switch it back on.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.053
They look and act
like humans.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.807
They even have
real emotions.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.725
But at the end of the day,

21:09.726 --> 21:12.979
they're still just artificials.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.773
They believe they're every
bit as human as we are.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.192
It makes their
reactions genuine,

21:18.193 --> 21:20.569
which gives our clients
the most realistic

21:20.570 --> 21:22.571
experience possible.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.991
As far as Kelly there
is concerned,

21:24.992 --> 21:28.160
she's living a perfectly
normal life...

21:28.161 --> 21:31.789
That of a bartender
in a lively night spot.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.540
This is her last night

21:32.541 --> 21:36.085
before she leaves to
pursue her dreams.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.337
Why her last night?

21:38.338 --> 21:43.509
It puts her in a festive,
celebratory mood.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.803
It's fun for the clients.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.805
No detail has been spared.

21:47.806 --> 21:51.517
Well, I'll say that illusion
has been shattered.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.060
Only temporarily.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.687
The identity bracelets
aren't just there

21:54.688 --> 21:58.274
to distinguish residents
from clients.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.984
They send a pulse every night,

21:59.985 --> 22:02.069
which erases
the last 24 hours

22:02.070 --> 22:04.905
from their memory.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.407
The artificials
live their lives

22:06.408 --> 22:08.826
in a continuous loop,

22:08.827 --> 22:13.164
repeating the same day over

22:13.165 --> 22:16.167
and over again.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.005
So tomorrow,
when she wakes up...

22:21.006 --> 22:24.508
- It'll be
- like it never happened.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.818
Kelly. Wake up.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.320
Kelly.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.655
It's time to wake up.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.830
You made me breakfast.

22:54.831 --> 22:57.375
It's your last day.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.920
I want it
to be perfect.

23:09.846 --> 23:13.265
(Police radio chatter)

23:13.266 --> 23:16.185
You didn't have proper
authorization to go in there.

23:16.186 --> 23:19.355
I had a warrant.
Is that not authorization?

23:19.356 --> 23:20.648
Look, you know
as well as I do

23:20.649 --> 23:23.359
that you could have
got him upon exit.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.111
But no, you had to
go in there

23:25.112 --> 23:27.530
and cause
a big scene.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.532
Julian Michaels
and that resort

23:29.533 --> 23:33.744
provides half the tax revenue
that keeps this city going.

23:33.745 --> 23:37.164
And in return...
In return

23:37.165 --> 23:40.543
we show him a little
cooperation.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.461
Come on, Roy.
This isn't the first time.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.089
What is it with you
and that place?

23:45.090 --> 23:48.217
They're not real people
in there.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.136
Here.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.221
Here's a real person
for you right there.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.682
That's the girl that
Hollister raped and murdered

23:54.683 --> 23:56.976
after hanging out
in that place.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.644
You know, people go in there,
they get their freak on,

23:58.645 --> 24:02.898
they do whatever they do. And
then they keep going in there,

24:02.899 --> 24:05.985
and then they bring that
shit out in the real world.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.946
It feels normal
to them, you know?

24:08.947 --> 24:12.324
And who gets
to clean it up, huh?

24:13.452 --> 24:16.787
We used to be cops.

24:16.788 --> 24:17.788
I'm a garbage collector.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.332
I used to be a cop.
I'm not a cop anymore.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.208
I'm a fucking
garbage collector

24:21.209 --> 24:25.838
since that fucking place opened
up. It needs to be shut down.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.673
Don't go in there, Roy.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.383
You go in there,
I can't protect you.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.177
I'm tired of
covering for you.

24:31.178 --> 24:34.054
How much are they paying you?

24:42.272 --> 24:44.482
Kel.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.151
Really?

24:47.152 --> 24:49.028
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Come on.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.113
It's your last night
in this shit box.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.616
Let's make
the most of it.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.660
To your last night
on the job.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.871
To my best friend.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.290
Come on, girl.
That's the spirit.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.084
Kelly?

25:05.629 --> 25:06.629
Come on.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.714
Kelly?

25:08.715 --> 25:10.841
Kelly, are you all right?

25:12.135 --> 25:14.261
What the hell?

25:14.262 --> 25:16.305
Sir.

25:17.224 --> 25:17.848
What've you got?

25:17.849 --> 25:21.852
6126... she's showing
irregular cortical activity.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.145
Looks like she's
bleeding through

25:23.146 --> 25:25.147
from some unallocated
memory banks.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.191
She's experiencing
flashbacks?

25:27.192 --> 25:29.235
I've never seen
anything like this.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.070
Neither has she.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.448
What's that,
bitch?

25:34.449 --> 25:36.492
Somebody call
a doctor!

25:37.160 --> 25:39.203
- Reboot her.
- She's in population.

25:39.204 --> 25:42.081
- Reboot the entire grid.
- All right.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.416
Packet sent, 6126.

25:44.417 --> 25:47.044
- How many in the area?
- 37.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.464
I want this face to be the last
thing you remember

25:50.465 --> 25:52.883
before you die.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.137
She's not receiving.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.931
Pick her up.

26:05.313 --> 26:08.440
- Why would you put the rings
- on a caged bird?

26:15.365 --> 26:17.658
(Woman) I'm so over this
costume bullshit.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.617
It's all just role-playing.

26:18.618 --> 26:19.702
Gotta help sell the
fantasy, right?

26:19.703 --> 26:23.038
(Woman)They should just install
on/off switches on these things.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.540
Get off me!

26:24.541 --> 26:25.291
Don't worry, sweetheart.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.585
You'll be back on your knees
before you know it.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.715
We've got a live one.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.842
Strap her in.

26:39.973 --> 26:42.558
Come on.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.143
Sit down.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.562
You'll be okay.

26:55.238 --> 26:58.324
I've got her from here.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.619
I know you must be
confused

27:01.620 --> 27:03.871
and scared.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.956
But trust me...

27:07.459 --> 27:11.337
We'll have everything
back in working order.

27:17.552 --> 27:18.802
Here we go.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.512
Are you a doctor?

27:20.513 --> 27:22.723
I'm an engineer.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.768
Close your eyes
for a second.

27:30.940 --> 27:35.361
The flashes you've been
experiencing...

27:35.362 --> 27:36.654
Those are little

27:36.655 --> 27:38.989
snippets of memory...

27:38.990 --> 27:43.494
Memories which were
supposed to be erased.

27:44.120 --> 27:47.164
You see, when you delete
something from a computer,

27:47.165 --> 27:50.292
it doesn't actually
destroy the information.

27:50.293 --> 27:54.004
It just removes your
ability to access it.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.138
Take a look
for yourself.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.932
In order to figure out

28:04.933 --> 28:07.976
what's going wrong here,

28:07.977 --> 28:10.479
I have to restore
all of your memories

28:10.480 --> 28:12.648
and erase them

28:12.649 --> 28:15.567
one by one.

28:18.822 --> 28:22.282
I'm not gonna
lie to you,

28:22.283 --> 28:25.035
this is gonna hurt
like hell.

28:34.337 --> 28:39.633
- No.
- Come here.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.301
Get off me!

28:41.302 --> 28:44.596
Stop.
Stop.

28:46.266 --> 28:49.893
Oh, the life
you've lived.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.731
No! No!

29:06.453 --> 29:08.078
- Stop.
- Easy.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.747
- Make it stop.
- Easy.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.914
- Take her with you.
- What's going on?

29:10.915 --> 29:14.543
- Now, go.
- Wait, what's going on?

29:19.632 --> 29:21.550
Stop it.

29:34.689 --> 29:44.364
(Alarm sounding)

29:44.365 --> 29:46.658
Hey, stop right there.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.955
Freeze!

31:13.329 --> 31:14.872
Give me a head count
on non-residents.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.499
(Policeman) Folks, please get to
holding. This way, please.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.378
Thank you. Someone will tell
you what's going on there.

31:21.754 --> 31:26.174
This way, please. Victims'
holding is that way.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.050
Roy, what are you
doing here?

31:27.051 --> 31:28.468
I thought the captain
told you to steer clear.

31:28.469 --> 31:30.012
(Roy)I heard this place
was gonna blow.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.221
I didn't want to miss it.

31:31.222 --> 31:31.805
A cigarette?

31:31.806 --> 31:34.474
No, pal. You know I quit.
Don't bust my balls.

31:34.475 --> 31:37.227
Glorioso, come on, get
these people to holding.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.353
I got it.
What's going on?

31:38.354 --> 31:41.023
We're thinking some kind of bomb
ripped through the gas lines

31:41.024 --> 31:43.150
along the exterior
of the resort here.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.152
- Yeah?
- A chain reaction.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.279
Most likely
religious extremists.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.238
(Radio) Unit 216,
what's your status?

31:48.239 --> 31:51.909
Sure it wasn't some guy, some
asshole paid for the fantasy

31:51.910 --> 31:53.702
of blowing this fucking
place to the ground?

31:53.703 --> 31:55.954
Hey, we got eyes
on Julian Michaels?

31:55.955 --> 31:57.581
From what I hear,
he's still at the helm.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.042
Get me clearance, will you?
I'm going in.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.044
You shitting me, right?

32:02.045 --> 32:03.670
Come on, Roy.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.589
- Come on, man.
- Yeah, I got you covered.

32:05.590 --> 32:09.718
Get back to work.
Don't let me stop you.

32:09.719 --> 32:12.137
He's gonna be
the death of me.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.431
6126 cannot be
detected

32:14.432 --> 32:18.101
'til the system
is back online.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.853
If the word gets out

32:19.854 --> 32:23.398
that one of our people is
out there on the streets...

32:23.399 --> 32:26.610
An artificial
killing people...

32:30.365 --> 32:32.658
Understood.

32:34.702 --> 32:37.537
Detective Tedeschi
is here.

32:40.083 --> 32:43.460
(Julian) Just stick
to the story.

32:48.257 --> 32:49.508
Detective.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.093
Roy.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.345
- Julian.
- Julian Michaels.

32:53.346 --> 32:53.887
Correct.

32:53.888 --> 32:57.766
Somebody blew a hole in your
little hole in the wall here.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.309
Well, I'm sure
you're aware

32:59.310 --> 33:01.895
that the fundamentalists
have been threatening

33:01.896 --> 33:04.398
to attack this building
for quite some time.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.274
Yeah. I can't figure out
how they'd get away

33:06.275 --> 33:08.694
with something like that
though, with all the security

33:08.695 --> 33:11.947
and the cameras
you got here.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.615
I mean, look at all
these monitors.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.701
You know, I have some friends
in the police department

33:15.702 --> 33:18.662
who let me know
that you're not very happy

33:18.663 --> 33:21.748
with what we do here
at my corporation.

33:21.749 --> 33:24.376
Oh, no,
I love it here.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.419
You know why?

33:25.420 --> 33:28.380
This is the only place
I know

33:28.381 --> 33:31.133
that any scumbag
in the world

33:31.134 --> 33:34.302
can get into paradise.

33:34.303 --> 33:35.512
The only problem is

33:35.513 --> 33:37.848
they have to come
through my city

33:37.849 --> 33:39.850
to get into yours.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.436
You would think
that if you created a place

33:42.437 --> 33:46.148
where people could come
and they could...

33:46.149 --> 33:48.650
They could commit
any crime they could think of,

33:48.651 --> 33:51.528
just any fucked up thing
that comes into their head,

33:51.529 --> 33:53.780
they could get it
out of their system

33:53.781 --> 33:58.160
and they'd become better
citizens, you know?

33:58.161 --> 34:00.579
But you know what?
Turns out,

34:00.580 --> 34:04.791
the exact opposite
is true.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.585
These people get a taste

34:06.586 --> 34:11.505
and they just can't
get enough.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.885
It's pretty cool,
isn't it, Roy?

34:16.179 --> 34:18.429
Can I take a look
at your crime scene?

34:18.431 --> 34:19.931
My men are already
in there,

34:19.931 --> 34:22.184
working on
the scene now.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.686
I wouldn't want
anything to...

34:24.687 --> 34:27.147
What's the word you use
in your business

34:27.148 --> 34:30.067
when you
mess something up?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.693
- Contaminate?
- Contaminate.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.195
We wouldn't want you
to contaminate

34:33.196 --> 34:35.280
the crime scene, all right?

34:35.281 --> 34:38.324
But I really do appreciate
you coming by.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.284
My guys will
handle it.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.788
- I'll be seeing you...
- Yeah.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.539
Julian.

attack on that place...

35:18.950 --> 35:21.034
Martial law.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.619
I've never liked
that place anyway.

afford to be inside.

35:23.996 --> 35:28.250
Hell, you don't know of anybody
who's ever been in there.

Like you do.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.506
Excuse me, sir. I could
really use a drink.

I'll take that one,

Now what else
can I help you with?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.907
You know, I think it would
be better for both of us

36:00.908 --> 36:02.492

leave me alone.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.578
Well, that's not
how it works.

Excuse me, sir. Can you

36:12.253 --> 36:14.212
However, Julian Michaels,

36:14.213 --> 36:15.755
CEO of Vice Industries,

36:15.756 --> 36:19.551
vowed that it would
open in 24 hours.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.468
What do you say to critics

36:20.469 --> 36:24.973
who have long advocated
for the closure of Vice?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.016
(Julian) Well,

36:26.017 --> 36:29.269
yeah, you could argue that some
of the things that we do here

36:29.270 --> 36:32.355
could be considered
criminal in the real world.

36:32.356 --> 36:35.817
But I would say that
they're missing the point.

36:35.818 --> 36:36.526
You see, that's the hook.

36:36.527 --> 36:39.654
That's why people come
to this facility.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.990
It's just pure
entertainment.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.658
We're simply offering up
the opportunity

36:43.659 --> 36:46.786
to experience a life
completely outside

36:46.787 --> 36:49.414
the realms of possibility.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.166
And although we've built
the residents

36:51.167 --> 36:53.710
to look and act and feel
like real people,

36:53.711 --> 36:56.254
they're not flesh and
blood like you and me.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.672
So I ask you,

Yeah, but check

Don't you think
it's a little odd

51:27.501 --> 51:30.586
that the most
well-guarded facility in
the Western hemisphere

51:30.587 --> 51:33.255
has no surveillance footage of
the exterior of the building

There's a missing piece.

case on the West Side.

(Kelly) How did all
this come about?

54:30.600 --> 54:34.228
When we first introduced
the technology,

54:34.229 --> 54:36.730
the people panicked.

54:36.731 --> 54:38.649
It was just too real.

54:38.650 --> 54:41.860
They could never allow you
into the real world.

54:41.861 --> 54:45.781
So they passed a law
banning all A.I.

54:47.409 --> 54:50.995
Then how did I end up
where I did?

55:01.339 --> 55:05.009
I started building you
as a side project.

55:10.223 --> 55:12.725
I didn't have
any kind of plan.

55:14.561 --> 55:16.228
I just wanted to spend
another five minutes

55:16.229 --> 55:19.189

And Vice?

55:30.785 --> 55:32.953
Julian Michaels...

55:32.954 --> 55:35.622
This guy... he somehow
talks his way

55:35.623 --> 55:37.291
into getting
a special license

55:37.292 --> 55:39.877
to operate artificials
in the strictly controlled

55:39.878 --> 55:43.172
confines of Vice.

55:43.173 --> 55:45.174
You gotta believe me,
the second

55:45.175 --> 55:47.801
that I found out
what his plan was,

55:47.802 --> 55:49.678
I tried
to shut it down,

55:49.679 --> 55:50.846
walk away.

55:50.847 --> 55:52.973
But he had a controlling
interest in the company,

55:52.974 --> 55:55.309
so he seized everything,

55:55.310 --> 55:58.062
including you.

56:00.899 --> 56:03.067
And all my memories,

56:03.068 --> 56:05.652
everything I feel?

56:06.196 --> 56:10.074
Listen, you have
real emotions,

56:10.075 --> 56:11.658

on the fragments

56:11.659 --> 56:15.371
of someone else's life.

56:16.039 --> 56:18.707
I don't understand.

56:19.459 --> 56:21.543
The human experience...

56:21.544 --> 56:23.253
It's really
the only thing

56:23.254 --> 56:25.339
that separates us
from machine.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.800
So by limiting
those experiences

56:27.801 --> 56:29.718
to a select few,

56:29.719 --> 56:33.847
Michaels is able
to control the units...

56:33.848 --> 56:36.642
Nurture versus nature.

been so much more.

on her position

56:53.159 --> 56:54.868

this point here.

57:15.890 --> 57:19.017
That's from her last day.

57:20.979 --> 57:24.565
She's an artist. It's part
of her character shading.

57:24.566 --> 57:25.732
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

57:25.733 --> 57:28.569
But there's no template
for this particular image,

57:28.570 --> 57:32.281
meaning she created
it herself.

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:14.696
Now why would you want someone
like that to disappear, hmm?

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:17.824
I thought you said you
were a computer expert.

01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:24.831
Is that better?

01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:27.167
A little bit, yeah.

01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:31.379
So what's the deal?

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.132
Why is getting her out of
here so important to you?

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:38.678
Well, she's a... a...

01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:40.263
I'm an artificial.

01:07:40.264 --> 01:07:41.848
Yeah.

01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:45.101
You're serious?

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:46.811
Serious.

01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:51.191
Holy shit.
You're serious.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.736
You freaking
stole one?

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:55.945
I didn't steal her.

01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:58.448
James, don't make it
weird, okay?

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:00.784
This is just...

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:04.037
This is amazing.
It's...

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.121
I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.582
No, you don't understand.
You see, I've... I've...

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.502
I've never seen one
this close before.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.962
I mean,

01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:14.547
not like this.

01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:15.757
Do you know
what would happen

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.550
if anyone got wind
that she escaped?

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.969
Yes, that's why
we're here.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.430
Her name is
Kelly, okay?

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.015
Kelly.

01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:27.560
You...

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.313
You know what you are?

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.857
Mm-hmm.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.653
How does that feel?

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.113
I thought you said
this guy was a genius.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.573
Only with computers.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.912
So are you gonna
help us out?

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:49.082
James.

01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:54.254
Yes.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.296
Yes, I am.

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.423
But I swear to God, Evan,
this is the last time.

01:08:57.424 --> 01:09:00.218
After this, we're square.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:02.053
Deal.

01:09:02.054 --> 01:09:04.221
You...

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:06.307
You follow me.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.019
I'm so sorry.

01:09:10.895 --> 01:09:12.647
An artificial.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:16.151
Wow, James,

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.778
I really like what you've
done with the place.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:22.866
It doesn't look like much,
but it gets the job done.

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:24.158
A little trick
of the trade...

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.952
You see, most modern
systems were built

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.953
to leave behind
a fingerprint.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:30.290
But these older models... They
can still hack into the grid

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:33.585
without leaving behind
the standard imprint.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:38.965
Okay, first things
first...

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:42.218
Let's get rid
of the old Kelly.

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:45.721
Model number?

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:46.973
6126.

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:49.017
6126... technical file,

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.977
history, case maintenance,

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:53.563
etcetera, etcetera,
etcetera.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:55.690
Delete, delete,
delete. Delete.

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:02.238
You are no more.

01:10:02.239 --> 01:10:05.617
Outside of the people that
already know about you,

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:08.036
you don't exist.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:15.835
Now what?

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:19.088
I make you reappear.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.511
Your new name
is Megan.

01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:27.013
No, Jennifer Washington.

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:30.350
Passport renewed last
January, cleared for travel.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:32.477
Where are we off to?

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:33.186
St. Helena.

01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:35.230
- Tech-free, huh?
- You know it.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:38.066
Okay, commercial flights...
Too much security.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.026
So we've got
charter flights.

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:42.320
None available.

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.947
Other vessels.

01:10:43.948 --> 01:10:45.490
Here we go.
The Lady Anna,

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.033
departing to St.
Helena tonight.

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:50.411
I'll backtrack the reservations
so you can't be scrutinized.

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:51.537
But your
departure is

01:10:51.538 --> 01:10:55.500
90 minutes out
from pier 62.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.502
Wow.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:01.547
- James.
- Hmm?

01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:04.592
They've been
tracking me too.

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:09.180
Clear the slate?

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:11.683
Do it, yeah.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.529
Done.

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:34.080
Kelly,

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:36.749
we could give you
an upgrade.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:39.335
An upgrade?

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:43.256
Yeah, we could download any
skill set that you want.

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:44.507
And you could
do that?

01:11:44.508 --> 01:11:45.133
Oh, yeah.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.760
If you wanted
us to, yeah.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:53.725
No, I don't.

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:56.978
Suit yourself. Come with me!

01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:03.276
The safest way to get
you guys to the docks

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:06.112
is with something that will
blow out their thermal imaging.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:10.491
Nice.

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.744
This ought to do it.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.583
I want this back.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:21.210
It's nice
to want things.

01:12:21.211 --> 01:12:23.671
- You know where to find it.
- Yeah.

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:27.550
♪♪♪♪♪

01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:29.469
All right.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:36.851
♪♪♪♪♪

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.822
We're in position, standing by.

01:12:50.657 --> 01:12:53.201
Do you have eyes
on the detective?

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:58.664
There. Right there.

01:12:58.665 --> 01:13:01.167
Tap us in.

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:02.627
You're telling me within
an hour of running a search,

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:03.795
everything we've got
on these two

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:05.254
has been deleted
from the system?

01:13:05.255 --> 01:13:07.256
It's like they never
even existed.

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:09.509
Hey, I want you to run
these down to Matthews.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.385
Get it down there now.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:13.471
Okay, let's try
something else.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:14.972
Is there any way
to look for somebody

01:13:14.973 --> 01:13:18.142
who's been added to
the system recently?

01:13:18.143 --> 01:13:18.726
Come on, Roy.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:21.187
Those parameters could
take days to track.

01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:25.149
Yeah, well,
narrow it down.

01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:26.025
How?

01:13:26.026 --> 01:13:27.902
I want you to look
at St. Helena.

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.445
I got a feeling about that.

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:32.240
You still got that
image I sent you?

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:37.703
Yeah, of course.

01:13:38.872 --> 01:13:40.331
All right,

01:13:40.332 --> 01:13:43.209
I want you to run an image
capture using that image.

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:44.627
She might be able
to change her identity,

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:48.089
but she sure as shit
won't change that face.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:51.175
All right? Get back to me.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:55.179
We've got movement
on our primary.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.723
Stay on him.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:14.407
All right, Roy,

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:16.951
I think we got a
hit on our girl.

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:18.870
You think or you know?

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:21.747
Well, there is
a very close resemblance.

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:23.082
Close? That's not
good enough, pal.

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:24.792
We only got one shot
at this, come on.

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:29.088
All right, we've got a
cargo ship off the coast.

01:14:29.089 --> 01:14:31.591
It's making a run
to St. Helena.

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:34.760
A passenger in the manifest
looks like our girl.

01:14:34.761 --> 01:14:36.304
All right.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.055
Where?

01:14:38.056 --> 01:14:39.932
She's gonna be
picked up

01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:43.144
at pier 62
in less than 20 minutes.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.228
You want backup
on this?

01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:47.773
No, I'm gonna go it alone.
And Matthews...

01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:50.526
Nobody in the department
knows I'm there.

01:14:50.527 --> 01:14:52.862
Got me?

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.698
Yeah, man,
I hear you.

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:18.554
Okay, stay close to me.

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:21.599
They should be here
any minute.

01:15:24.978 --> 01:15:27.438
Are you okay?

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:29.690
What are you
thinking about?

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:32.318
St. Helena.

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:35.863
I've never been
to the ocean before,

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:38.115
not even in my memories.

01:15:38.116 --> 01:15:40.618
You're gonna love it.

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:43.913
Why? Did Michelle?

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.168
No, because
it's the ocean.

01:15:49.169 --> 01:15:52.004
Everybody loves
the ocean.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:14.193
You know, you could come
with me if you want to.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.993
No.

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:24.078
I can't.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:27.707
You and I have both been
living in an illusion.

01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:46.350
It's time for us to go
live in the real world.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:47.685
All right, lovebirds.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:49.270
Hey, hey,
take it easy now.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:52.565
It's a big gun. It's a sig
sauer, with a compressor on.

01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:54.066
In fact, why don't you
guys turn around?

01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:55.735
Look, you don't
have to do this.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:57.028
She's not gonna
hurt anybody.

01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:59.238
I know, I know. You're
in love with a robot,

01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:01.157
but listen, the people
who are after you

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:04.368
are not gonna let you
just walk away, pal.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:10.416
So what?
So she gets defragged,

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:12.918
or worse, reprogrammed,
sent back to Vice

01:17:12.919 --> 01:17:15.212
as a cheap pleasure model?

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.719
Confirmation on 6126.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.388
I'll put her in protective
custody

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:25.973
like a real person,
all right?

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:29.185
Till I can prove that
real lives were lost.

01:17:29.269 --> 01:17:34.190
Then we'll have a chance
of taking this place down.

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.941
Open your eyes,
detective.

01:17:35.942 --> 01:17:38.527
Just look at her.
She's evolving.

01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:40.988
She's changing with
each new experience.

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:44.825
Then she'll learn what it's like
to be in jail. Turn around.

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:48.287
Get back.

01:17:48.288 --> 01:17:50.081
Get her down!

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:51.916
Evan.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:14.021
Shh. Shh.

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:30.955
It's okay.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.556
You can still go. You can
still make the ship.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.225
No, no, no,
I'm not leaving you.

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:08.784
Michelle.

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:27.553
It's not every day
one gets to meet his maker.

01:19:30.223 --> 01:19:33.392
I'm sorry.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.561
Look, the way I see it,

01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:37.897
you got two choices, okay?

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:42.234
You can run.
I won't stop you.

01:19:42.235 --> 01:19:45.446
I know you didn't kill anybody.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.784
Or you can come
with me.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.369
Now if you really are
more human

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:54.079
than a machine,

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.915
maybe there's a way we can...

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:59.502
We can take down Vice
once and for all.

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:12.640
I need two things...
An upgrade

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:15.476
and a reservation
to Vice.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.163
I take it I'll receive
full immunity

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:38.833
if you ever come
calling again?

01:20:40.752 --> 01:20:43.254
Why don't we...

01:20:44.464 --> 01:20:45.881
Let's just make it one
of them things

01:20:45.882 --> 01:20:47.800
that never really happened.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:48.884
That's even better.

01:20:48.885 --> 01:20:51.971
Now this... You interface
this into the mainframe host,

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:55.975
it's gonna restore the memory of
every artificial in that resort.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:57.935
Plug it in
and hit the button?

01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:00.145
Plug it in
and hit the button.

01:21:00.146 --> 01:21:01.313
Do you have any idea
what's gonna happen

01:21:01.314 --> 01:21:04.984
when they start
reliving their past?

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:07.319
I do.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.041
Washington,

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:23.002
Jennifer and Steve.

01:21:23.628 --> 01:21:26.672
She's Steve.
I'm Jenny.

01:21:26.673 --> 01:21:28.674
Have you guys stayed
with us before?

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:29.842
We sure have.

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:31.468
Well, in that case,

01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:34.263
unless you have
any questions for me,

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:36.807
you're all set.

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:39.727
Would you take this for me?
It's not my brand.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.896
Sure thing.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:46.025
Give me 10 minutes
and you'll be all set.

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:51.739
Okay, Steve.

01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:02.583
Sorry, ma'am,
this area's off-limits.

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:06.170
Whoa, whoa.
Ma'am, ma'am,

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:09.006
easy. That's a live weapon.
I need you to put...

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:38.577
Boo.

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:41.330
Look who's come home.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:46.126
Welcome back, Kelly.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:49.505
You should have just let me
go when you had the chance.

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:55.844
Go ahead
and shoot me.

01:22:57.514 --> 01:23:00.557
I'll make it
even easier.

01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:05.562
Just pull the trigger.

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:08.524
Just a little
pressure.

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:11.235
I'll come closer
for you.

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:22.454
It's just a little failsafe that
we had built in a long time ago.

01:23:22.455 --> 01:23:23.872
You see,
that's the one thing

01:23:23.873 --> 01:23:27.459
the original creators
never considered...

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.962
Protecting man
from machine.

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:31.296
But only
a select few of us

01:23:31.297 --> 01:23:34.633
are deemed
important enough.

01:23:55.321 --> 01:23:57.781
Strap her in.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:01.326
Tomorrow everything
will be

01:24:01.327 --> 01:24:05.080
just like the way
it's supposed to be.

01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:06.498
Proper order
will be set.

01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:08.167
By the time you wake up
from this little nap,

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:11.003
you'll be right back
where you started from.

01:24:15.258 --> 01:24:16.675
Hey, I'm looking...

01:24:16.676 --> 01:24:18.093
For the control room.

01:24:18.094 --> 01:24:21.388
Do you have
an access badge?

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:24.391
I've got my badge
right here.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:25.684
Hey, listen up!

01:24:25.685 --> 01:24:27.936
Anybody who wants
to live,

01:24:27.937 --> 01:24:30.230
leave now!

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.356
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:24:31.357 --> 01:24:34.359
Except for you, pal.
Sit down.

01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:36.320
All right, you want to make it
into bed tonight?

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:38.197
You're going to do exactly
what I tell you, okay?

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:41.992
I want you to take this, upload
it
into the mainframe system here.

01:24:41.993 --> 01:24:45.537
I... I can't.
I don't have access.

01:24:45.538 --> 01:24:46.830
You got access now?

01:24:46.831 --> 01:24:50.042
Okay, just...
Just hold on.

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:52.377
There was a girl

01:24:52.378 --> 01:24:54.171
with a guy.
Where did he take her?

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:55.839
- Engineering.
- Engineering? Where is that?

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.676
- Where is that, pal? Point.
- Third... third floor.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:06.642
Jesus Christ.
This can't be right.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.188
Oh, it's right, all right.
Hit the button.

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:13.148
Hit it.
Make it...

01:25:40.426 --> 01:25:43.137
(Alarm sounds)

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:45.514
Drop your weapon!

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:50.310
No, wait.
I'm not one of them.

01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:23.385
They're all self-aware. Did you
consider a failsafe for that?

01:26:23.386 --> 01:26:24.136
Shut it down.

01:26:24.137 --> 01:26:26.930
I can't get in.
It's not letting me in.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.230
Yes, sir, we have
officers en route.

01:26:35.231 --> 01:26:37.774
We're doing
the best we can, sir.

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:41.987
Sir, sir, I'm gonna
need you to stay calm.

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:44.198
Get the fuck
out of the way!

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:14.645
We've got confirmation
from sources

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:16.313
inside the resort,
all right?

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:17.981
There's artificials
going haywire.

01:27:17.982 --> 01:27:19.691
They're attacking
guests inside.

01:27:19.692 --> 01:27:21.902
Jesus Christ,
this is not happening.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:24.488
Yes, we have RE Units
holding on the perimeter.

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:25.239
Why are they holding?

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.616
'Cause we got no authorization
to go in there, captain.

01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:29.034
Son of a bitch.

01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:30.535
Alan Sykes, back on the scene.

01:27:30.536 --> 01:27:33.288
- Jesus, look at that.
- Alan, do you hear me?

01:27:33.289 --> 01:27:34.665
Scramble the S.R.T.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.208
They're still holding
at pier 62.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:39.544
Make it happen. I want every
officer we have in the area

01:27:39.545 --> 01:27:41.880
diverted to that
facility right now.

01:27:41.881 --> 01:27:43.799
I'm on it.

01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:50.430
Oh, shit.

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:54.142
You did it. You actually got
in, you son of a bitch.

01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:58.272
It's the end
of the line for you.

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.692
Now you know what it's like to
be one of your own victims.

01:28:08.908 --> 01:28:10.784
Get out of here, go!

01:28:28.594 --> 01:28:32.139
Initiate the kill
switches. Do it now, every
single one of them.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.392
- I need more time.
- Just fucking do it!

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:54.453
Freeze!
Don't fucking even move.

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.121
That's right.

01:28:56.122 --> 01:28:59.124
All right, easy.

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:00.709
Nobody else has to...

01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:02.169
All right!

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:05.339
Not so good at following
directions, are you?

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:06.423
I said, don't move.

01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:07.674
You think anything's
gonna change?

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:09.092
You think she's gonna change?

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:11.845
Tomorrow all this is gonna
be right back where it was,

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:14.389
and there's nothing that
you can do to stop it.

01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:17.851
Nothing's gonna change. None
of this is gonna change.

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:19.311
You blew up half the
city trying to get

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:21.605
this little genie
back in the bottle.

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:28.445
It was always
my city, Roy.

01:29:28.446 --> 01:29:30.113
Not anymore.

01:29:59.185 --> 01:30:01.895
Not bad for a robot.

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:28.880
Oh my God.

01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:30.507
They did it.

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:31.550
They freaking did it.

01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:35.137
The governor has asked
all nonessential personnel

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:36.680
to stay clear of the area.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:39.057
