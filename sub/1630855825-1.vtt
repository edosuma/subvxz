WEBVTT

01:10.213 --> 01:11.835
Fuck you!

01:45.938 --> 01:48.113
Whew. It's hot out there today.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.394
It's no Iraq.

01:53.496 --> 01:58.088
I know I've said it before,
but it's so hot there,

01:58.192 --> 02:00.021
you can literally
fry an egg on a rock.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.574
Literally.

02:03.990 --> 02:06.027
"Literally."

02:06.131 --> 02:07.511
That's a funny word, huh?

02:07.615 --> 02:10.306
It means the opposite
of figurative,

02:10.411 --> 02:12.309
but now it's a synonym.

02:14.139 --> 02:16.451
What?

02:16.555 --> 02:18.626
I mean, it's not the worst
thing, but you got to admit

02:18.729 --> 02:21.629
that when a word that means
something so concrete

02:21.732 --> 02:26.081
can actually now mean
the exact opposite, that's--

02:26.185 --> 02:29.119
that's nuts, right?

02:29.223 --> 02:32.398
Like, something weird
is going on.

02:32.502 --> 02:34.435
Something weird, man.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.471
You know what I heard
the other day?

02:37.576 --> 02:40.233
Huh? You'll think this is
hilarious. It's so messed up.

02:40.337 --> 02:43.651
Apparently, they sell chairs now

02:43.754 --> 02:46.411
designed to feel like
they're hugging you.

02:46.516 --> 02:48.828
You see what I'm saying? And
I don't mean that figuratively.

02:48.932 --> 02:50.313
I mean that literally.

02:50.416 --> 02:52.729
They literally feel
like they're hugging you.

02:52.832 --> 02:54.213
They got these--

02:54.317 --> 02:56.560
I don't know, like,
long, fuzzy, dangly arms.

02:56.664 --> 02:59.253
They wrap around you,
make you feel good.

03:02.359 --> 03:04.361
What is that?

03:04.465 --> 03:06.674
I'll tell you what it is.

03:06.777 --> 03:08.503
It's loneliness, man.

03:11.748 --> 03:13.888
People don't know
how to be lonely.

03:15.786 --> 03:17.271
Hey, Officer!

03:18.375 --> 03:21.275
Hey. Looking good.

03:24.485 --> 03:26.901
1-Adam-12.
Failure to yield.

03:28.592 --> 03:32.113
Failure to--
There you go. Failure to yield.

03:32.217 --> 03:34.149
Smart man, 1-Adam-12.

03:34.253 --> 03:35.772
Driver's roughly 6 foot.

03:35.875 --> 03:38.257
- Skip that paperwork.
- Requesting K-9.

03:38.361 --> 03:40.017
Ohh, now you got
paperwork, bro.

03:40.121 --> 03:42.088
10-57 Foxtrot. 612 Crocker.

03:42.192 --> 03:44.229
Repeat, 612 Crocker.
Requesting K-9.

03:44.332 --> 03:45.782
This is King 1.
Show me en route.

03:45.885 --> 03:47.232
10-9 that location.

03:47.334 --> 03:48.647
Okay, 612 Crocker.
King 1 en route.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.305
10-4.

03:53.410 --> 03:55.240
What do you say, bud?

04:32.311 --> 04:35.418
There you go.

04:35.521 --> 04:38.524
Five-oh rolling up.
What's up, boys?

04:38.628 --> 04:41.286
What are y'all doing here?!

04:42.770 --> 04:45.600
Fuck off, Blue!
Nobody wants you here!

04:47.706 --> 04:50.502
Dude rolled a stop.
Tried pullin' him over.

04:50.605 --> 04:52.711
He started driving
like a bat out of hell.

04:52.813 --> 04:55.334
Jumped the curb here
and took off running that way.

04:55.438 --> 04:57.302
- Dangerous?
- Eh.

04:57.405 --> 04:59.164
The fuck took you so long, man?

04:59.269 --> 05:01.547
You walk your fucking dog
over here?

05:01.651 --> 05:04.378
I'll get him out.
You can ask him yourself.

05:07.208 --> 05:08.830
Hasn't been reported stolen.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.833
Something tells me
we're now looking for a...

05:11.937 --> 05:15.527
some Chinese X-I-A...

05:15.630 --> 05:18.150
Hernandez, you got this, buddy.
Now, what's the rule?

05:18.253 --> 05:21.015
"I" before "E"
except after "C," seÃ±or.

05:21.118 --> 05:22.257
You got a description?

05:22.361 --> 05:24.501
Average height.
Hispanic. Skinny.

05:24.605 --> 05:26.572
Definitely not Chinese.

05:26.676 --> 05:29.886
Probably undocumented.
Got spooked and ran.

05:29.989 --> 05:32.406
My man Dante over here
got a look.

05:32.509 --> 05:34.131
Seems credible.

05:34.235 --> 05:36.617
- Solid.
- Dante's alright.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.241
Knows everything
on these streets.

05:40.345 --> 05:41.760
Alright. Give me a sec.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.970
Get the fuckin' dog
away from here!

05:50.424 --> 05:52.460
Alright.
It's time to go to work.

06:21.212 --> 06:22.939
Good. Got drugs.

06:26.321 --> 06:28.116
1-Adam-12 requesting backup.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.361
Copy that, 1-Adam-12. Sending
backup to your location.

06:37.609 --> 06:39.093
- Bingo.

06:41.164 --> 06:44.788
Search. Search. Search.

06:44.892 --> 06:46.238
Come on.

06:48.413 --> 06:49.966
Search.

06:51.864 --> 06:54.073
Back there, it's just
a bunch of animals in there.

06:54.177 --> 06:56.110
No place for animals.

07:03.393 --> 07:05.533
Ah, shit!

07:06.914 --> 07:09.054
How are we supposed to clean
their shit off the street

07:09.157 --> 07:12.333
if we can't even get
their shit off the street?!

07:12.437 --> 07:14.300
Yeah, whatever!

07:17.407 --> 07:20.652
Greene! Make sure no one
wanders the fuck over here!

07:28.142 --> 07:31.110
Hey. LAPD, man.
Hey. We just want to talk.

07:34.424 --> 07:36.909
Don't run, okay?
I've got a dog.

07:37.013 --> 07:39.256
We just wanna resolve this
without anybody getting hurt!

07:46.471 --> 07:48.093
Shots fired!
I repeat, shots fired!

07:48.196 --> 07:50.509
Where's my backup?!

07:50.613 --> 07:52.615
Are you hit?

07:52.718 --> 07:54.479
No. I'm okay.

07:56.066 --> 07:57.999
- No! Don't touch that!

08:09.770 --> 08:11.841
Go!

08:13.808 --> 08:16.190
Ace!

08:16.293 --> 08:18.019
Just pull back.
Wait for backup!

08:18.123 --> 08:21.160
Son of a bitch.
He put glass on the ground!

08:21.264 --> 08:23.887
Come here. Let me look at you.
Come here.

08:23.991 --> 08:26.476
You're okay, huh?
Yeah? Alright.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.133
Let's go.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.351
Come on.

09:08.863 --> 09:11.072
You good? Huh? Okay.

09:22.774 --> 09:24.845
Show me your hands!

09:26.363 --> 09:27.572
Give me your hands.

09:30.678 --> 09:34.061
Who gave you this jacket?
Where'd they go?

09:39.342 --> 09:42.448
Hey! Hey!
Get on the ground!

09:42.552 --> 09:44.002
Drop the gun!

10:03.331 --> 10:06.024
Ace! Ace?

10:09.475 --> 10:10.615
- Ace!

10:32.119 --> 10:34.500
Officer down!

10:34.604 --> 10:36.710
Officer down!

10:39.436 --> 10:40.886
That's good, right?

10:40.990 --> 10:43.717
Hey!
This officer needs attention!

10:43.820 --> 10:47.134
We heard you, man!
We'll get to your dog.

10:47.237 --> 10:50.344
He's a police officer.
He needs help. Now!

10:50.447 --> 10:52.691
People first. Okay?

10:54.313 --> 10:57.006
Let dispatch know they're gonna
start transporting...

10:57.109 --> 10:58.559
Roger that.

11:01.873 --> 11:03.219
Hey. Get your fucking hands--

11:03.322 --> 11:06.463
Jake! Jake!
Come on! Jake! Come on!

11:06.567 --> 11:08.707
Jake! Calm down!

11:12.366 --> 11:14.402
LAPD to King 1.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.096
LAPD to King 1.

11:20.477 --> 11:23.688
LAPD to King 1?

11:23.791 --> 11:26.587
K-9 Ace is 10-7.

11:26.691 --> 11:28.485
Gone but never forgotten.

11:28.589 --> 11:32.248
Rest in peace, dear friend,
and protect us from above.

11:34.975 --> 11:38.599
We are here today
to remember a true hero...

11:38.703 --> 11:40.912
in every sense of the word.

11:41.015 --> 11:43.915
Ace was not only
a great police K-9,

11:44.018 --> 11:48.367
but was also a loyal partner
of Officer Jake Rosser.

11:48.471 --> 11:52.130
His unwavering bravery
will never be forgotten.

11:54.097 --> 11:57.687
Good and merciful Lord,
we humbly pray

11:57.791 --> 12:00.138
that you will safely keep
all of those

12:00.241 --> 12:03.555
who serve and protect
our communities every day.

12:03.658 --> 12:07.317
In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

12:07.421 --> 12:10.217
Port. Arms.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.945
Ready. Aim. Fire.

12:14.048 --> 12:15.325
Ready.

12:15.429 --> 12:17.500
Aim. Fire.

12:19.295 --> 12:21.124
I know.

12:22.919 --> 12:25.577
I know you'd forgive me.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.372
You were always the bigger man.

12:29.684 --> 12:31.445
I don't know how you did it.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.208
I know, I know. I should
stop crying and go home.

12:40.557 --> 12:42.836
Have a little sympathy, man.
I gotta live with this.

12:45.459 --> 12:47.150
Okay.

12:50.602 --> 12:52.190
You're a good boy.

13:07.515 --> 13:09.172
People are angry.

13:09.276 --> 13:11.899
They have expressed
that anger...

13:12.003 --> 13:14.453
And you look no further
than the video to see why.

13:14.557 --> 13:16.455
Again, a warning.
What you're about to see

13:16.559 --> 13:18.492
may be considered upsetting.

13:18.595 --> 13:21.495
After the officer... EMS,

13:21.598 --> 13:24.498
he's seen violently attacking
a Hispanic man.

13:32.782 --> 13:34.232
Oh, hey.

13:36.613 --> 13:39.340
Guys don't find
my night shifts convenient.

13:40.894 --> 13:42.965
Go ahead.

13:52.043 --> 13:53.803
- Lucky dog.
- Huh?

13:53.907 --> 13:55.770
New bed.

13:55.874 --> 13:58.325
Uh, right.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.498
Hey. Uh...

14:33.601 --> 14:35.327
What happened?

14:37.191 --> 14:39.918
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:40.022 --> 14:42.852
Jake, for real...

14:42.956 --> 14:45.751
I'm around if you want to talk.

14:45.855 --> 14:48.996
No pressure or anything.
I just wanted you to know that.

14:50.066 --> 14:53.207
Thanks. I'm good.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.143
Okay.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.398
You entered the building
without backup,

15:11.501 --> 15:14.642
pursued the suspect
up several flights of stairs,

15:14.746 --> 15:16.161
and were ambushed.

15:16.265 --> 15:17.852
My partner and I
entered the building,

15:17.956 --> 15:20.269
and we were ambushed.

15:20.372 --> 15:23.479
But Officer O'Keefe
wasn't with you.

15:23.582 --> 15:27.379
O'Keefe went back to help
after the vehicle exploded.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.763
And you chose not to help?

15:31.866 --> 15:34.214
Even though there was
an officer down.

15:34.317 --> 15:38.632
Well, at that point,
two officers were down.

15:38.735 --> 15:41.462
And the suspect posed
a significant, violent threat

15:41.566 --> 15:43.913
to the community.

15:44.017 --> 15:46.329
I read the manual.

15:46.433 --> 15:50.195
Tennessee vs. Garner.
It's settled law.

15:50.299 --> 15:52.197
You carried your partner
to first responders,

15:52.301 --> 15:54.475
where you proceeded
to attack one of them.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.718
Is that correct?

15:55.821 --> 15:57.133
You gonna jump in here
any time?

15:57.237 --> 15:58.652
Union's hands are tied.

15:58.755 --> 16:00.999
But don't worry.
I'm taking notes.

16:01.103 --> 16:03.105
Great. Thanks.

16:03.208 --> 16:04.554
We're not the enemy, Jake.

16:04.658 --> 16:06.280
We're just trying
to paint the picture.

16:06.384 --> 16:08.110
I just want to know
what happened to my partner

16:08.213 --> 16:10.181
and who the shooter was.
- Just take a breath.

16:10.284 --> 16:12.321
The suspect commanded my dog.

16:12.424 --> 16:14.875
In German.
Like he was one of us.

16:14.979 --> 16:18.534
Okay. We get it.
Now let us do our jobs.

16:18.637 --> 16:21.226
Everything involved
in this mess is S.I.U. now,

16:21.330 --> 16:23.297
under our review
of force investigation.

16:23.401 --> 16:25.679
You mean,
homicide investigation.

16:32.272 --> 16:34.584
You were in the service?

16:34.688 --> 16:36.414
Marines.

16:36.517 --> 16:39.348
Have you ever been diagnosed
with PTSD?

16:44.249 --> 16:47.701
You know the answer.
You knew that when you hired me.

16:47.804 --> 16:49.668
It wasn't disqualifying.

16:49.772 --> 16:51.705
No, it wasn't.

16:51.808 --> 16:53.327
Did you ever get any treatment?

16:53.431 --> 16:56.089
Maybe prescriptions
or recreational drugs?

16:56.192 --> 16:57.607
Anger issues?

16:57.711 --> 16:59.161
I just wanna know what happened
to my partner.

16:59.264 --> 17:01.784
Alright, gentlemen.
Let's call it a day.

17:10.344 --> 17:15.004
Very helpful, Jake.
Good luck.

17:15.108 --> 17:16.626
Just hang on, Jake.

17:16.729 --> 17:18.145
Hmm.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.978
Okay, Jake.

17:24.082 --> 17:26.464
This is how this is gonna work.

17:26.566 --> 17:29.605
You're gonna see someone.
A professional.

17:29.708 --> 17:32.090
They're gonna help you
work through your issues,

17:32.194 --> 17:34.127
and then you're gonna
get a new partner

17:34.230 --> 17:37.026
and you're gonna
get back out there.

17:37.130 --> 17:39.580
We'll set up a therapist
for you. You got it?

17:42.307 --> 17:44.585
I wanna see Ace's autopsy.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.898
Yeah, well...

17:47.001 --> 17:49.728
I just want you
to shut the fuck up

17:49.832 --> 17:51.834
and do what you're told.

17:51.937 --> 17:54.940
Those are your options.

17:55.044 --> 17:58.634
Then fire me.
I could care less.

18:00.981 --> 18:02.776
You sleep on that.

18:12.268 --> 18:14.201
- Clown.
- ...fucking circus.

18:14.305 --> 18:16.203
- Yeah.

18:16.307 --> 18:20.069
Easy, Jake. You need
to use the back door.

18:20.173 --> 18:21.691
Come on.

18:23.693 --> 18:25.764
How's the view
from under the bus?

18:25.868 --> 18:30.390
I think they'd prefer a view
in front of a moving train.

18:30.493 --> 18:34.359
Listen. I need to find out
Ace's cause of death.

18:34.463 --> 18:36.810
Sorry, Jake.
I figured it was obvious.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.263
He was a good boy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks.

18:43.334 --> 18:45.819
Just anything peripheral.

18:45.922 --> 18:48.062
I need the closure.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.168
I'll see what I can do.

19:22.269 --> 19:23.684
Unh! Oop, oop, oop. Come on.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.445
Come-- Oh, you got it.
You got it.

19:25.548 --> 19:28.551
What a good dog.
What a good dog you are.

19:28.655 --> 19:30.450
Jake.

19:30.553 --> 19:33.625
Come on.
Can you take over here?

19:33.729 --> 19:35.627
Hey. Good dog.

19:38.872 --> 19:40.667
Okay. Let's go.

20:30.303 --> 20:32.788
Getting a new dog? Fuck.

20:34.824 --> 20:36.343
No.

20:38.518 --> 20:41.555
Unsolicited advice.

20:41.659 --> 20:44.524
Longer you wait,
the harder it gets.

20:53.257 --> 20:55.051
Thanks.

20:55.155 --> 20:56.570
Yeah.

21:03.577 --> 21:05.441
- What's up with him?
- Her.

21:05.545 --> 21:08.168
Last handler
fucked her up but good.

21:08.272 --> 21:11.482
- How so?
- Can't say.

21:11.585 --> 21:15.002
But not because you don't know.

21:15.106 --> 21:18.834
Sealed in some plea deal that
Command wanted to keep quiet.

21:18.937 --> 21:20.939
They didn't give two shits
about Socks, though,

21:21.043 --> 21:23.114
so I took her back.

21:23.217 --> 21:24.702
She's a narcotics animal.

21:24.805 --> 21:28.188
You want to know
what happened to her?

21:28.292 --> 21:30.017
Use your imagination.

21:35.885 --> 21:37.301
Hey, girl.

22:40.433 --> 22:44.022
Hey, man.
Any of you guys know Dante?

22:44.126 --> 22:45.748
Dante?

23:04.595 --> 23:06.182
Nice tricks, honey.

23:08.875 --> 23:12.154
Might as well nail a badge
to your forehead.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.225
Like a sore thumb, huh?

23:14.328 --> 23:18.505
Baby, you ain't
even close to passing.

23:18.609 --> 23:20.404
That makes two of us.

23:29.585 --> 23:32.657
Know anyone down here
named Dante?

23:32.761 --> 23:34.832
Missing a couple legs?

23:34.935 --> 23:38.076
A thousand dudes down here
named Dante.

23:38.180 --> 23:40.665
All missing somethin'.

23:40.769 --> 23:44.048
It's like looking
for a needle in a...

23:45.739 --> 23:48.293
We got a lot of those, too.

23:48.397 --> 23:52.988
Even if I did know, what good
would it be if I tell you?

23:59.926 --> 24:04.137
Face that pretty
in a place like this.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.587
Careful.

24:07.485 --> 24:09.383
Thanks for the smoke, honey.

24:28.851 --> 24:31.336
Hey!
Looking to score, white boy?

24:31.440 --> 24:33.477
- Up against the wall.

24:33.580 --> 24:35.996
- I got him on this side.
- Suspicious white male.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.033
Satanistas was ready
to smoke you, fool.

24:38.136 --> 24:40.242
Yeah, yet you chose
to arrest me.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.002
They control these streets.

24:42.106 --> 24:44.004
The streets of
downtown Los Angeles?

24:44.108 --> 24:47.525
- Gun!
- Now you're really fucked.

24:47.629 --> 24:50.355
Whoa, whoa. Hold up.

24:50.459 --> 24:53.600
Aren't you the dude on the news
who fucked up that EMT?

24:53.704 --> 24:57.052
Oh, shit.
The one with the dead dog.

24:58.502 --> 25:00.365
Damn, bro.
What are you doing down here?

25:00.469 --> 25:04.197
Errands. You know an informant
down here named Dante?

25:04.300 --> 25:05.681
Aren't you suspended?

25:05.785 --> 25:08.512
You shouldn't
fuck with this clique.

25:08.615 --> 25:11.031
Best to get lost.
- Easy enough.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.897
Hey! You got a dollar?!
Heh-heh!

25:49.000 --> 25:51.313
Hey. I just want
some alcohol, man.

25:53.729 --> 25:56.870
Well, I'll use that,
but, uh, hey.

26:02.773 --> 26:05.569
Thank ya! Thank ya.

26:05.672 --> 26:08.537
Hey, you know a guy
named Dante?

26:08.641 --> 26:10.021
Dante?

26:10.125 --> 26:12.955
Uh, who?
No, but you got a dollar?

26:13.059 --> 26:14.957
You still got a dollar
you can give me?

26:15.061 --> 26:17.442
- Get out of here.

26:17.546 --> 26:20.100
Yeah. I-I just need a dollar
for some alcohol, man.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.861
You got a dollar? Heh!

26:21.964 --> 26:24.726
Come on.
I just need a dollar, man.

26:24.829 --> 26:26.210
Please, man. Just a dollar.

26:26.313 --> 26:29.247
- Please?

26:29.351 --> 26:31.008
Fuck you, man.

26:34.149 --> 26:37.980
...story of an LAPD officer's
shooting caught on camera.

26:38.084 --> 26:40.983
Well, as you can see here
in this cellphone video,

26:41.087 --> 26:43.296
after shooting
and killing a suspect,

26:43.399 --> 26:46.920
Officer Jake Rosser
violently and without warning

26:47.024 --> 26:49.026
assaults paramedic
Gonzalo Robles,

26:49.129 --> 26:51.304
who was treating officers
on the scene.

26:53.478 --> 26:55.239
...reporting live

26:55.342 --> 26:57.586
outside City Hall,
where earlier today

26:57.690 --> 27:00.175
LA Council members
were up in arms

27:00.278 --> 27:01.797
about what they'd seen,

27:01.901 --> 27:04.282
including council member
Priscilla Cross,

27:04.386 --> 27:05.939
who held a press conference.

27:06.043 --> 27:08.977
Police brutality cannot,
will not...

27:09.080 --> 27:12.290
Introducing the middleweight
champ of the world.

27:12.394 --> 27:14.292
Ah. Did you place a bet?

27:14.396 --> 27:17.468
- That's a low blow.
- Yeah.

27:17.571 --> 27:19.090
Watching too much TV lately.

27:19.194 --> 27:20.954
...allocate the city's
law-enforcement budget

27:21.058 --> 27:23.439
to underserved neighborhoods
and low-income housing

27:23.543 --> 27:24.993
for our un-homed Angelinos.

27:25.096 --> 27:26.788
When did the City of Angels
turn to Hell?

27:26.891 --> 27:28.893
You forget
Lucifer was an angel.

27:28.997 --> 27:31.551
We get what we deserve,
I guess.

27:31.655 --> 27:34.934
Yeah. Let's see it.

27:35.037 --> 27:37.177
It's best to keep this shit analog.

27:39.455 --> 27:41.285
You shouldn't have this.

27:49.396 --> 27:51.053
Fentanyl.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.509
Have you seen
anything like that before?

27:58.612 --> 27:59.855
You know I like poker.

27:59.959 --> 28:02.720
- Ramos!
- Yeah, I know it.

28:02.824 --> 28:05.516
It's killed more people in the
past year than the Vietnam War.

28:05.619 --> 28:09.037
I saw that symbol on the street
before Ace got shot.

28:09.140 --> 28:11.556
I need to know more about
the crew producing it.

28:11.660 --> 28:13.351
Jake...

28:15.043 --> 28:17.148
What? Go ahead. Say it.

28:18.736 --> 28:20.738
Thank you.

28:23.396 --> 28:25.363
You're playing a game
when you don't have a team.

28:25.467 --> 28:28.366
Yeah, but they're using some BS
from my past as ransom.

28:28.470 --> 28:32.681
So let 'em!
If it gets you back in the mix.

28:32.785 --> 28:35.477
See the shrink.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.169
The longer you stick with this
"angry lone wolf" thing,

28:38.273 --> 28:40.724
the longer
you're gonna get iced out.

28:43.865 --> 28:46.626
Do yourself a favor.

28:46.730 --> 28:48.455
Do what lonely people do.

28:50.768 --> 28:52.425
Get a dog.

29:03.747 --> 29:05.645
Leland!

29:05.749 --> 29:06.991
I'm here.

29:07.095 --> 29:09.131
I wanna pick a new dog.

29:11.893 --> 29:15.310
Socks? Socks is a puzzle.

29:15.413 --> 29:19.348
You need a turnkey,
not a fixer-upper.

29:19.452 --> 29:22.835
Hey. Take it easy.
She's been known to snap.

29:24.768 --> 29:27.322
I know the feeling.

29:29.462 --> 29:31.464
Hey, girl.

29:31.567 --> 29:35.709
Yeah. Hey. Come here.
Let's get this off you.

29:35.813 --> 29:39.368
Yeah. Come on, girl.
Come here.

29:40.714 --> 29:42.716
Uh-huh.

29:42.820 --> 29:47.031
Hey, now. Hey, you.

29:47.135 --> 29:50.310
Huh? Let me see that.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.312
Titanium.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.901
Lost some teeth
doing whatever that...

29:55.005 --> 29:57.766
son-of-a-bitch handler
had her doing.

29:57.870 --> 29:59.837
He used her
like a blunt instrument.

29:59.941 --> 30:02.046
Not like you would, Jake.

30:04.566 --> 30:06.706
Yeah, she's the one.

30:09.536 --> 30:11.159
So?

30:15.611 --> 30:17.234
Come on.

30:19.443 --> 30:22.308
Come here.
Let's get that off of you.

30:24.413 --> 30:25.518
Yeah.

30:30.419 --> 30:32.594
You hungry?

30:32.697 --> 30:34.561
And I'm not on the menu.

30:34.665 --> 30:36.046
You and me, girl.

30:36.149 --> 30:39.463
We're gonna help each other out.

30:39.566 --> 30:42.638
Nobody will take you on, and
everybody's got me frozen out.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.611
Looks like
you've seen some stuff.

30:51.993 --> 30:53.926
And I've seen some stuff.

30:54.029 --> 30:55.755
There you go, bud.

30:58.551 --> 31:00.794
Let's go. Come on.

31:19.330 --> 31:21.643
Boy, am I hungry.

31:33.793 --> 31:35.588
Thoughts of suicide?

31:39.281 --> 31:41.525
More officers died from suicide

31:41.628 --> 31:45.322
than any other line-of-duty
death this year.

31:45.425 --> 31:47.634
Line-of-duty deaths were down,

31:47.738 --> 31:50.430
not suicides.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.294
That's true.

31:56.091 --> 31:58.162
Suicide is a...

31:58.266 --> 32:00.440
It's a universal idea.

32:02.408 --> 32:05.687
"Suicide." That's a funny word.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.689
German, too. Selbstmord.

32:11.831 --> 32:13.695
To murder oneself.

32:20.046 --> 32:22.497
Have you been
in therapy before?

32:26.087 --> 32:29.469
Would you say
you struggle with anger?

32:31.264 --> 32:32.679
No.

32:32.783 --> 32:35.786
Jake...

32:35.889 --> 32:38.858
You killed a man.

32:38.962 --> 32:42.931
You assaulted a paramedic.

32:43.035 --> 32:45.416
You're a combat veteran.

32:50.076 --> 32:52.527
You asked
if I struggle with it.

32:54.770 --> 32:56.393
I don't.

32:58.740 --> 33:00.845
I let anger win a long time ago.

33:06.782 --> 33:08.646
Are you alone?

33:19.450 --> 33:20.658
Hi.

33:20.762 --> 33:22.522
You want a cup of coffee?

33:31.876 --> 33:34.258
No TV?

33:34.362 --> 33:36.743
I just use the neighbor's
as a radio.

33:49.066 --> 33:51.379
- Can I ask what happened?
- You haven't heard?

33:51.482 --> 33:54.071
No.

33:54.175 --> 33:57.109
You must be the only one.
The whole town hates me.

33:57.212 --> 33:59.594
Fuck the whole town.

34:08.775 --> 34:10.742
It's very nice.

34:10.846 --> 34:12.434
You're not a very good liar.

34:12.538 --> 34:14.229
No.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.438
I'm not a good liar.

34:19.061 --> 34:20.822
That's a good thing.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.309
So...

34:25.413 --> 34:28.554
do you ever do anything for fun?

34:28.657 --> 34:31.764
Besides read?

34:31.867 --> 34:33.731
Sometimes I watch movies.

34:36.148 --> 34:37.735
Where?

34:41.084 --> 34:43.327
You have a nice smile.

34:43.431 --> 34:46.157
Something tells me
sightings of it are rare.

34:52.957 --> 34:54.545
You keep it all in.

34:57.824 --> 34:59.481
It's okay.

35:10.630 --> 35:14.427
She begs when I don't give her
what she wants.

35:14.531 --> 35:16.567
She knows you'll give in.

35:30.926 --> 35:32.928
So, we did break
some records yesterday.

35:33.032 --> 35:36.553
You know, LAX, Long Beach
Anaheim all broke records.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.900
We saw temperatures
topping out into the 90s

35:39.003 --> 35:40.419
for a lot of these places.

35:40.522 --> 35:42.352
Things are finally
gonna start to cool down

35:42.455 --> 35:45.044
because we still have these
lingering offshore winds,

35:45.148 --> 35:46.770
but those winds
are slowly weakening.

35:48.289 --> 35:50.014
Alright. Let's go.

35:55.158 --> 35:57.574
Hey.

36:11.277 --> 36:13.383
Every morning.
Every fucking morning!

36:13.486 --> 36:15.868
Pay me my fucking toll!

36:15.971 --> 36:18.802
Pay me my fucking toll!

36:18.905 --> 36:20.976
Hey! Hey!

36:21.080 --> 36:23.427
Hey. Your dog looks burnt-out!

36:29.813 --> 36:31.539
For some of you,
it's your first day.

36:31.642 --> 36:33.989
For others, it's a refresher.

36:34.093 --> 36:37.096
Keep in mind, there's always
something new to learn.

36:39.926 --> 36:43.654
Handling is intuitive, right?
It's about instinct.

36:43.758 --> 36:47.969
The dog's instincts,
but your instincts, as well.

36:48.072 --> 36:49.729
Now, these dogs, your dog,

36:49.833 --> 36:52.525
they can run faster than you,
hear better,

36:52.629 --> 36:57.427
smell better,
react quicker than you can.

36:57.530 --> 36:59.808
And they will read

36:59.912 --> 37:03.053
every little suggestion
that you make to them.

37:03.156 --> 37:04.710
Hopp, hopp, hopp.

37:04.813 --> 37:08.300
Your dog will become
completely addicted to you.

37:08.403 --> 37:10.198
Don't abuse that power.

37:10.302 --> 37:13.926
There's one thing
your dog can't do.

37:14.029 --> 37:18.137
Your dog can't think ahead.

37:18.241 --> 37:20.104
Look. Bottom line is...

37:20.208 --> 37:23.729
if you keep your dog safe,
your dog will keep you safe.

37:23.832 --> 37:25.248
So...

37:25.351 --> 37:27.595
let's get back to basics, uh...

37:27.698 --> 37:30.391
a few confidence builders, yeah?

37:31.737 --> 37:33.325
Socks. Hier.

37:36.983 --> 37:38.571
Socks. Platz.

37:39.745 --> 37:41.333
Platz.

37:41.436 --> 37:42.472
- She ain't listening to him.

37:42.575 --> 37:44.405
Socks, platz.
Come on, girl.

37:44.508 --> 37:47.511
Come on, girl.
Socks, hier.

37:51.929 --> 37:53.345
Socks.

37:59.143 --> 38:01.870
She doesn't listen
to a word I say.

38:01.974 --> 38:05.011
Hmm. Well...

38:05.115 --> 38:08.670
Maybe it's got nothing to do
with what you're saying.

38:12.329 --> 38:13.848
Here he goes again.

38:17.161 --> 38:18.991
Socks, hier.

38:21.131 --> 38:23.616
Socks, platz.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.032
Platz.

38:26.136 --> 38:27.206
Socks, platz.

38:30.105 --> 38:33.108
Hey. Socks.
Come here. Platz.

38:33.212 --> 38:35.283
Sit. Sitz.

38:35.387 --> 38:38.804
Hey. Socks.
You're killing me, Socks.

38:38.907 --> 38:41.910
Look. What am I telling you
that I'm not saying?

38:42.014 --> 38:43.843
Huh? Yeah.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.880
Look, I know
I seem bitter and angry,

38:45.983 --> 38:47.433
but I'm not mad at you.

38:47.537 --> 38:49.504
No, it's just--
since I've been back--

38:49.608 --> 38:51.989
It's a long story.
I'll tell you some other time.

38:52.093 --> 38:54.509
You know I can't magically
drop all this shit

38:54.613 --> 38:55.959
and be as easygoing as you,
just like that.

38:57.167 --> 39:00.204
Hey! Whoa!

39:00.308 --> 39:02.414
Ho-ho!

39:02.517 --> 39:04.036
Hey, hey, hey!

39:04.139 --> 39:07.073
There you go. Congratulations.

39:07.177 --> 39:10.076
You flunked first grade,
but you passed second and third.

39:12.113 --> 39:13.942
Good girl. Good girl.

39:40.762 --> 39:43.455
My dad drank coffee
at night, too.

39:45.077 --> 39:49.184
He drank coffee to go to bed, literally.

39:49.288 --> 39:52.912
He drank a cup of coffee
before bed every night to relax.

39:59.471 --> 40:02.405
Do you drink
anything besides coffee?

40:02.508 --> 40:04.337
I try not to.

40:14.451 --> 40:16.902
You're seeing someone.

40:17.005 --> 40:18.179
Hey, beautiful.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.663
I am.

40:21.493 --> 40:24.116
Human connection is crucial.

40:30.294 --> 40:33.470
Any anger issues lately?

40:33.574 --> 40:35.265
None whatsoever.

40:38.510 --> 40:40.960
And your former partner?

40:41.064 --> 40:43.756
How are you managing
those feelings?

40:45.793 --> 40:48.485
Well, I'm-- I'm...

40:48.589 --> 40:50.832
learning to let go.

41:02.257 --> 41:04.018
I need keys to my vehicle.

41:10.473 --> 41:11.991
You're not on the roster.

41:12.095 --> 41:15.167
I-- I left his collar
in the car.

41:17.618 --> 41:19.205
- Oh, fuck, man.
- Hey.

41:19.309 --> 41:21.035
I'm sorry.

41:25.453 --> 41:27.006
Thank you.

41:54.724 --> 41:57.036
Requesting a BOLO
on a male victim.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.349
50s. Black. No legs.
First name, Dante.

41:59.452 --> 42:02.421
Last seen on 6th and San Julian.
Possible kidnapping.

42:02.525 --> 42:04.112
Possible 207. 50s. Black.

42:04.216 --> 42:06.183
No legs. First name, Dante.
BOLO alert.

42:06.287 --> 42:08.772
10-4.

42:08.876 --> 42:11.430
1-Adam-12
responding to a 207.

42:11.534 --> 42:12.914
Dante. En route.

42:13.018 --> 42:15.261
1-Adam-12.
10-4. Show en route.

42:26.065 --> 42:30.276
Dante, why am I hearing
that you're getting kidnapped?

42:30.380 --> 42:33.141
Hmm? Who's fucking with you?
Huh?

42:33.245 --> 42:36.524
Is that true?
Have you been getting kidnapped?

42:36.628 --> 42:38.112
Dante, I need a name.

42:38.215 --> 42:39.838
211 in progress.
800 block of Maple.

42:39.941 --> 42:41.391
Repeat. 800 block of Maple.

42:41.494 --> 42:43.048
Units in the area,
please respond.

42:43.151 --> 42:46.983
Yo, we gotta roll.

42:47.086 --> 42:49.261
Be safe.

42:49.364 --> 42:51.401
What's up, dawg?

43:11.007 --> 43:13.250
- Dante!
- What's up, dawg?

43:13.354 --> 43:14.527
What's it doing, man?

43:14.631 --> 43:16.771
- Oh, shit.

43:16.875 --> 43:19.429
Hey, man. Chill out.
I'm not here to hassle you.

43:21.707 --> 43:23.606
Don't worry about her.
She's not coming out.

43:23.709 --> 43:25.538
You know about everything
that's going around

43:25.642 --> 43:27.023
on these streets, don't ya?

43:27.126 --> 43:28.887
You see everything, don't ya?

43:28.990 --> 43:30.889
- Hey, man, listen to me.

43:30.992 --> 43:33.823
Listen to me.
I need you to talk to me, okay?

43:37.205 --> 43:39.829
I know her.

43:39.932 --> 43:41.589
- No, you don't.
- I know her.

43:41.693 --> 43:43.349
No, man. That's a new dog.

43:43.453 --> 43:45.697
But you know a lot, don't ya?
What else can you tell me?

43:45.800 --> 43:47.560
I'm trying to find out
who killed the last one.

43:47.664 --> 43:49.493
Ask you a few questions?

43:49.597 --> 43:51.150
I'm good.

43:52.945 --> 43:54.878
I'll be right back, alright?

44:27.635 --> 44:29.395
Mmm! Mmm!

44:29.499 --> 44:33.020
I just need you to answer a few
simple questions, alright?

44:52.764 --> 44:54.317
Come on, man.
I'm not squeezing you.

44:54.420 --> 44:56.560
I just need a name.

44:56.664 --> 44:58.562
I don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

45:05.328 --> 45:07.986
Who's calling shots
for the Satanistas?

45:11.230 --> 45:12.404
Hmm?

45:16.063 --> 45:18.582
China.

45:18.686 --> 45:20.826
Dirty secrets.

45:20.930 --> 45:22.655
Hidden in plain sight.

45:24.934 --> 45:29.628
Nobody gives a fuck
'cause it feels so good.

45:29.732 --> 45:31.664
They don't make it
to this side of town.

45:31.768 --> 45:33.943
Huh? What side of town?

45:34.046 --> 45:36.117
Town. One side of the world.

45:38.844 --> 45:40.501
- I thought she was a ghost.

45:40.604 --> 45:42.261
But you ain't him.

45:42.365 --> 45:45.540
What are you talking about?
You know my dog?

45:45.644 --> 45:48.233
- I remember.
- No, Dante.

45:48.336 --> 45:50.442
I just told you.
That's my new dog.

45:50.545 --> 45:51.684
You don't remember?

45:51.788 --> 45:53.928
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

45:54.032 --> 45:56.448
You don't remember enough.

45:56.551 --> 45:58.933
I remember too much.

45:59.037 --> 46:02.247
Alright, Dante.
Stay out of the sun, okay?

46:02.350 --> 46:03.869
Yeah.

46:03.973 --> 46:05.802
Leave him alone!

46:14.500 --> 46:16.123
Preach to the choir.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.481
- What's up, dawg?
- Hey.

46:34.727 --> 46:36.833
Jesus!

46:36.937 --> 46:39.008
I see you made a new friend.

46:39.111 --> 46:41.700
Yeah.
Good advice is good advice.

46:41.804 --> 46:44.116
Regardless of who gives it.

46:44.220 --> 46:46.049
Why do they call it "China"?

46:46.153 --> 46:47.844
'Cause that's where it's from.

46:47.948 --> 46:51.365
Along with everything else, now
you have synthetic opioids, too.

46:51.468 --> 46:54.299
Right.

46:54.402 --> 46:58.165
Jake. What do you want?

46:58.268 --> 47:01.754
Vehicle registration.
The car that blew up.

47:08.244 --> 47:10.487
I haven't forgotten
what you did for me.

47:12.489 --> 47:14.767
And you've kept it on the DL
like you promised.

47:14.871 --> 47:17.080
Ramos, drop it.

47:17.184 --> 47:18.702
Don't make me feel guilty.

47:18.806 --> 47:20.773
You're doing that
all by yourself.

47:20.877 --> 47:23.362
Yeah, knowing that I'm the root
of my own problems doesn't help.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.434
You gambled a little.
It's no big deal.

47:26.538 --> 47:28.436
It was only a three-hour drive
to pick you up.

47:28.540 --> 47:30.818
Yeah, while my daughter
was at home alone.

47:30.922 --> 47:33.200
Okay. You win. You owe me.

47:35.685 --> 47:38.377
How do you feel?

47:38.481 --> 47:40.241
Better.

47:40.345 --> 47:42.485
You're not just saying that,
are you?

47:42.588 --> 47:43.796
No, why would I do that?

47:45.108 --> 47:47.317
No.

47:47.421 --> 47:52.081
So I would sign off here
and say you're good to go.

47:52.184 --> 47:54.083
Healthy as a horse.

47:59.571 --> 48:01.538
I'd like to believe that...

48:03.540 --> 48:07.096
...that you've actually
thought about the things

48:07.199 --> 48:09.201
that you've been through, Jake.

48:22.007 --> 48:23.836
You like art?

48:23.940 --> 48:26.425
Sure. Do you?

48:26.529 --> 48:30.671
I do. I do.

48:30.774 --> 48:32.155
I think it's...

48:34.433 --> 48:36.159
...what we do
to remind ourselves

48:36.263 --> 48:39.059
that we can, you know,

48:39.162 --> 48:41.924
escape the swamp
of being an animal.

48:44.823 --> 48:46.687
There's a lot of truth in that.

48:46.790 --> 48:51.485
I've seen how creative
people can be in the art of...

48:51.588 --> 48:53.383
combat, killing...

48:57.870 --> 49:01.150
...and things
outright ingenious...

49:01.253 --> 49:03.428
and the destruction
of innocence.

49:07.639 --> 49:11.643
Used to signal to people
with any shred of virtue...

49:16.510 --> 49:19.306
...that you won't win
by being the bigger person.

49:22.550 --> 49:26.623
That causes you
to reject people.

49:26.727 --> 49:29.005
Because you know...

49:29.109 --> 49:32.112
more than most...

49:32.215 --> 49:34.838
we can never escape
being animals.

49:42.881 --> 49:44.607
More or less.

50:04.903 --> 50:08.079
Xiang Xi. Xiang Xi.

50:08.182 --> 50:10.115
2806 Pinecrest.

50:10.219 --> 50:12.083
Just another stolen car, Jake.

50:12.186 --> 50:14.292
That's it. We're square.

50:27.650 --> 50:30.239
You ready to get
back out there?

50:30.342 --> 50:31.619
Hmm?

50:34.174 --> 50:37.556
Hey. Don't let me
blow it today, okay?

50:41.698 --> 50:44.598
Well, let's see how long
it takes before she quits.

50:47.118 --> 50:48.981
You show 'em, girl.

50:49.085 --> 50:50.328
Such!

51:07.759 --> 51:10.141
Oh. Hey!

51:13.109 --> 51:16.078
Whoa, ho, ho! Hey!

51:16.181 --> 51:18.494
That dog moved
the whole damn tire!

51:22.325 --> 51:25.846
Come here. Thatagirl.
Thatagirl! Come on.

51:41.137 --> 51:43.001
Socks. Ablegen.

51:43.105 --> 51:44.761
Come here. Socks...

51:44.865 --> 51:46.556
- Good girl.

51:46.660 --> 51:50.698
Oh, yeah! Good girl!
Good girl! Thatagirl.

51:50.802 --> 51:52.700
I'd say!

51:57.912 --> 52:00.467
Whew!

52:00.570 --> 52:03.366
I knew I smelled something.

52:03.470 --> 52:05.713
They got you walking
a new dog, Rosser?

52:05.817 --> 52:08.233
Hernandez, how the hell
were you ever a sniper

52:08.337 --> 52:10.201
if you can't shut the fuck up?

52:10.304 --> 52:12.858
Hey, I'm just
making conversation.

52:12.962 --> 52:15.033
Which reminds me.

52:15.137 --> 52:16.414
You didn't happen to, uh,

52:16.517 --> 52:19.313
roll up on my man Dante,
did you?

52:19.417 --> 52:20.797
I know it was you.

52:20.901 --> 52:23.041
You shake down
an informant of mine again

52:23.145 --> 52:25.250
without talking to me first,

52:25.354 --> 52:27.666
I swear to God,
I will fuck you up.

52:31.049 --> 52:34.294
Get that bitch under control.

52:34.397 --> 52:36.537
Socks, platz.

52:38.436 --> 52:42.129
You know something, Rosser?

52:42.233 --> 52:44.096
I'm starting to like her.

52:44.200 --> 52:46.168
She got bigger balls than you.

52:54.141 --> 52:56.247
- Welcome back, Jake.
- Thanks, Parnell.

52:58.697 --> 53:03.012
Hey, Sarge?
How about you put me on 8?

53:03.115 --> 53:05.497
- The Spa? You, Rosser?
- Yeah, I think it would be good

53:05.601 --> 53:07.879
for us to work our way
back in, you know?

53:07.982 --> 53:10.778
Like a warm-up.
- Okay.

53:10.882 --> 53:14.126
Not a lot of guys would show
that type of humility.

53:14.230 --> 53:17.129
- Thanks.
- It wasn't a compliment.

53:34.077 --> 53:38.150
Come on. Let's go.
You gotta sit up here with me.

53:42.085 --> 53:43.086
Seriously?

53:43.190 --> 53:45.365
Hey, Fetch!

53:45.468 --> 53:47.712
See you later, putobitch!

53:58.688 --> 54:01.139
That's ridiculous. Did you
tell Larry to lock the door?

54:01.243 --> 54:02.830
- Yeah.
- See that, Socks?

54:02.934 --> 54:05.212
They talk to themselves
over here, too.

54:10.010 --> 54:11.598
I knew a...

54:45.908 --> 54:48.048
- ABD Security.
- Hey. How you doing?

54:48.151 --> 54:50.464
Uh, this is Officer Rosser, LAPD.

54:50.568 --> 54:52.915
- How can I help you?
- Was driving by and saw

54:53.018 --> 54:55.227
a possible sign of forced entry
at one of your locations.

54:55.331 --> 54:56.367
Which location?

54:56.470 --> 54:58.438
2806 Pinecrest.

54:58.541 --> 54:59.922
Do you have
an emergency to report?

55:00.025 --> 55:02.649
- Is your system active?
- System looks good.

55:02.752 --> 55:04.375
Yeah, yeah.
You should test it.

55:04.478 --> 55:05.962
No problem.

55:14.281 --> 55:17.802
Possible burglary.
2806 Pinecrest.

55:17.905 --> 55:20.080
This is King 8.
I'm in the vicinity.

55:20.183 --> 55:21.046
Show me en route.

55:21.150 --> 55:22.703
10-4.

56:15.722 --> 56:17.517
King 8.
Sounds inside the residence.

56:17.620 --> 56:19.864
Going to investigate.
- 10-4. Requesting backup?

56:19.967 --> 56:21.244
Negative.

57:10.915 --> 57:12.123
Platz.

57:29.589 --> 57:31.763
Socks, here! Socks!

57:37.873 --> 57:39.081
Socks!

57:51.403 --> 57:52.784
Socks.

58:11.423 --> 58:14.150
Hey.
Boy, where'd you come from?

58:14.254 --> 58:15.358
Faas!

59:12.208 --> 59:16.696
How did you manage this?
You don't have a scratch on you.

59:16.799 --> 59:18.352
- Breaking news.
- Ugh! Thanks!

59:18.456 --> 59:21.666
Another deadly incident
involving an LAPD officer

59:21.770 --> 59:24.048
in Bel-Air
has local residents reeling

59:24.151 --> 59:28.293
and LAPD bracing for social
pushback, turmoil, unrest,

59:28.397 --> 59:29.916
pressure from the commu--

59:33.229 --> 59:34.748
Hey. Cut it out.

59:39.788 --> 59:41.583
What? You have to pee again?

59:44.413 --> 59:47.658
What? Food?

59:57.150 --> 59:59.531
This? Is this
what you're looking at?

59:59.635 --> 01:00:02.120
Hey, girl. Oh, oh. Come here.

01:00:04.571 --> 01:00:06.953
There's something
you're not telling me.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.086
Made in China.

01:01:10.154 --> 01:01:11.811
Do you think you have a thing
for heat?

01:01:11.914 --> 01:01:13.985
Or are you just
really fuckin' lucky?

01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:18.956
Sir, I was in Bel-Air.
The Spa. How could I have known?

01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:20.716
You know,
that's a really good question.

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.858
Ramos, how could Rosser here
have known?

01:01:24.962 --> 01:01:26.618
- I'm sorry?
- Are you?

01:01:28.897 --> 01:01:31.762
I've only got
one other report here

01:01:31.865 --> 01:01:35.041
with that address in Bel-Air.

01:01:35.144 --> 01:01:38.354
And you know
whose name is on it.

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:42.324
We cased the house a few years
ago, but nothing materialized.

01:01:42.427 --> 01:01:45.120
Sure as fuck has
materialized now, hasn't it?

01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:47.225
Do you have any idea
how much fucking grief

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.780
I'm getting
because we busted a meth lab

01:01:49.883 --> 01:01:52.230
in the middle of
Bel fucking Air?

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:54.474
You know who lives
in that neighborhood?!

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.303
Not meth, sir. Fentanyl.

01:01:56.407 --> 01:01:58.374
They sweat it down
for street product and--

01:01:58.478 --> 01:02:00.066
Oh, shut the fuck up, Ramos.

01:02:00.169 --> 01:02:03.069
I called you in here
so that you could thank Rosser

01:02:03.172 --> 01:02:06.520
for finishing the job
that you couldn't do.

01:02:06.624 --> 01:02:08.177
So, go ahead.

01:02:08.281 --> 01:02:10.386
Tell him how you sent
in the human torpedo here,

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:14.356
the guy with all the issues,
to do the job you couldn't!

01:02:14.459 --> 01:02:16.013
Jake, look, I--

01:02:16.116 --> 01:02:18.360
I don't know if you assholes
have heard this,

01:02:18.463 --> 01:02:21.915
but the mob has its boot
on the throat of City Hall.

01:02:22.019 --> 01:02:23.986
We are getting gutted,

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:28.819
and I'm looking at two
prime reasons why right here!

01:02:28.922 --> 01:02:30.959
Now get the fuck out!

01:02:34.238 --> 01:02:36.343
You do the job
I tell you to do, Ramos.

01:02:36.447 --> 01:02:38.863
You don't get to just make up
the rules as you go along.

01:02:38.967 --> 01:02:40.900
- Come on.
- And, you...

01:02:41.003 --> 01:02:42.971
You get to go back to therapy.

01:02:43.074 --> 01:02:45.318
What, you shot one guy
and you stabbed another.

01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:48.286
What the hell are you
gonna think of next?

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.702
Oh, I'm sure
I'll think of something.

01:02:58.538 --> 01:03:01.196
Jake. Listen.

01:03:01.299 --> 01:03:04.820
Ramos, take it easy.
What? You got a nice seizure,

01:03:04.924 --> 01:03:06.546
and I got one of the guys
that killed my dog.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.584
Sitz.

01:03:10.688 --> 01:03:13.829
He spoke German.
Like the other guy.

01:03:13.933 --> 01:03:15.451
I need to know
what that's about.

01:03:15.555 --> 01:03:17.108
I don't know.

01:03:17.212 --> 01:03:20.456
Find out who handled Socks
before me. It's at S.I.U.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.632
Could be a grand-jury
indictment, sealed.

01:03:23.735 --> 01:03:25.496
- It's not gonna happen.
- Come on, Ramos.

01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:28.948
you're a good detective.
I know you can figure it out.

01:03:35.575 --> 01:03:37.957
Hey!

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.683
Hey, Jake. Where you going?

01:03:40.787 --> 01:03:42.513
Going for a walk.

01:03:42.616 --> 01:03:44.480
Do you wanna watch a movie
when you get back?

01:03:44.584 --> 01:03:45.965
I can't tonight, babe.

01:03:46.068 --> 01:03:48.622
I'm gotta go take care
of something.

01:03:48.726 --> 01:03:51.142
Alright. Be safe.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.390
Come on.

01:04:21.932 --> 01:04:23.968
What's going on, Socks?

01:04:25.797 --> 01:04:27.627
Huh?

01:04:30.664 --> 01:04:32.183
I told you not to come.

01:04:47.336 --> 01:04:48.959
Hey, hey. No.

01:04:49.062 --> 01:04:51.202
Shh. Hey. You no get us killed.

01:04:51.306 --> 01:04:52.928
Shh!

01:04:54.826 --> 01:04:57.174
You're a complicated dog.
You know that?

01:04:57.277 --> 01:05:00.108
You think too much
for your own good.

01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:01.661
Come on. Let's go.

01:05:04.595 --> 01:05:05.872
Let's go.

01:07:10.065 --> 01:07:12.619
Turn around. Slowly.

01:07:15.243 --> 01:07:17.003
Hey! Turn around!

01:07:17.107 --> 01:07:18.660
Stay where you are.

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:28.428
Who do you work for?

01:07:30.361 --> 01:07:32.467
- Nobody.
- Take off your mask.

01:07:43.409 --> 01:07:45.825
I thought Socks was dead.

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:48.172
- What'd you say?
- Where's Santiago?

01:07:48.276 --> 01:07:50.761
Who's Santiago?
Who-- Who are you?

01:07:50.864 --> 01:07:54.178
- Who's Santiago?!
- Alright. Come on. Careful.

01:07:54.282 --> 01:07:56.939
One drop of this,
and you're a goner.

01:07:57.043 --> 01:07:58.527
Who's Santiago?!

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:08.675
Socks, ablegen.

01:08:16.304 --> 01:08:18.513
Socks, faas!

01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:19.893
Nein.

01:08:21.757 --> 01:08:24.139
Faas!

01:08:24.242 --> 01:08:25.967
Toeten.

01:08:35.185 --> 01:08:37.256
You brought her back to me.

01:08:39.016 --> 01:08:41.052
Socks, hier.

01:08:41.156 --> 01:08:42.916
Nein.

01:08:57.483 --> 01:08:59.657
It's time to choose.

01:09:01.314 --> 01:09:05.353
There is our side...
or suicide.

01:09:05.456 --> 01:09:08.734
You'll bring me more dogs.

01:09:08.839 --> 01:09:10.496
I'm not dirty.

01:09:14.741 --> 01:09:15.707
I know you.

01:09:17.951 --> 01:09:20.230
I know you're an animal.

01:10:37.272 --> 01:10:38.998
You using again?

01:10:41.724 --> 01:10:43.865
The stress of this job
can be a lot.

01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:47.800
What is this?

01:10:47.903 --> 01:10:51.597
This... is the third incident
in a month.

01:10:53.357 --> 01:10:55.497
They took my dog.

01:10:55.601 --> 01:10:59.570
- Who?
- The Satanistas.

01:11:01.537 --> 01:11:03.540
They got a paint factory
in Vernon,

01:11:03.643 --> 01:11:07.544
where they cut fentanyl,
like the place in Bel-Air.

01:11:07.647 --> 01:11:11.064
They killed Ace and took Socks.

01:11:11.168 --> 01:11:12.549
Xiang Xi.

01:11:12.652 --> 01:11:15.759
EXIS Therapeutics. Look it up.

01:11:15.862 --> 01:11:18.831
Yeah, we'll get
right on that, Jake.

01:11:18.934 --> 01:11:20.695
But what we need to decide
right now

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:22.628
is whether your
substance-abuse problem

01:11:22.731 --> 01:11:25.389
is something we need to
be concerned about.

01:11:25.492 --> 01:11:27.528
I don't know. Maybe it's been
brought on by your PTSD?

01:11:27.633 --> 01:11:29.531
- I was drugged.
- Well, it wouldn't be

01:11:29.635 --> 01:11:32.396
the first time,
according to your file.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.329
Jake, what
he's trying to say...

01:11:34.433 --> 01:11:35.951
What I'm trying to say is,

01:11:36.055 --> 01:11:39.921
we think it's time for you
to take a break.

01:11:40.024 --> 01:11:41.474
A long one.

01:11:59.423 --> 01:12:02.805
Hey, Rosser! Hop in, man.

01:12:02.909 --> 01:12:04.394
I'm good.

01:12:04.497 --> 01:12:07.845
No. Seriously, Jake.

01:12:07.948 --> 01:12:09.537
Get in.

01:12:19.892 --> 01:12:22.239
They're sweeping the underpass
for Socks' body.

01:12:24.828 --> 01:12:27.175
A waste of time.

01:12:27.278 --> 01:12:29.626
I know.

01:12:29.729 --> 01:12:33.457
I don't believe
that S.I.U. bullshit.

01:12:33.561 --> 01:12:35.908
I know they got your partner.

01:12:37.564 --> 01:12:40.809
Who told you that?

01:12:40.912 --> 01:12:42.501
Ramos?

01:12:47.126 --> 01:12:48.852
Why the fuck do you care?

01:12:48.955 --> 01:12:53.269
If they fuck with your partner
and they fuck with you...

01:12:53.374 --> 01:12:55.099
they fuck with me.

01:12:58.448 --> 01:13:01.760
Find Socks, brother.

01:13:01.865 --> 01:13:05.351
And when you do,
we're gonna hit 'em so hard

01:13:05.455 --> 01:13:08.147
they'll be shitting
blood and fucking teeth.

01:13:27.994 --> 01:13:30.272
- What are you doing?
- I'm going away for a while.

01:13:30.376 --> 01:13:32.412
What are you talking about?

01:13:36.209 --> 01:13:37.763
You know, you do this stoic,

01:13:37.866 --> 01:13:41.249
"I can handle my shit" thing,
but open your eyes.

01:13:41.352 --> 01:13:42.698
You keep so much bottled up,

01:13:42.802 --> 01:13:44.286
you're blowing up
everything around you.

01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:45.840
You're probably right. Yeah.

01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:47.255
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:13:47.358 --> 01:13:48.567
I'm agreeing with you.

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:50.051
So you don't
have to argue with me.

01:13:50.153 --> 01:13:51.639
That is not the same thing.

01:13:51.742 --> 01:13:53.019
Mia, this is the last thing
that I need right now.

01:13:53.123 --> 01:13:54.435
But it was the first thing

01:13:54.537 --> 01:13:55.884
when you wanted
to get back on the job?

01:13:55.988 --> 01:13:58.715
Your friends from
the Special Investigations Unit,

01:13:58.818 --> 01:14:01.580
Officer Reed and Hasting,
came by the hospital.

01:14:01.683 --> 01:14:04.064
They mentioned you needed
to look normal, stable...

01:14:04.168 --> 01:14:06.308
so your shrink would sign
your permission slip.

01:14:06.412 --> 01:14:09.207
That has nothing
to do with this.

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.072
The fucked-up thing...

01:14:11.175 --> 01:14:13.419
I actually would have been
okay with that...

01:14:13.523 --> 01:14:16.180
if it wasn't for
everything else.

01:14:16.284 --> 01:14:18.424
Look.

01:14:18.528 --> 01:14:23.291
I don't know
what happened to Socks, but...

01:14:23.394 --> 01:14:25.051
I hope she's okay.

01:14:35.717 --> 01:14:37.995
Thoughts of suicide, Jake?

01:14:48.281 --> 01:14:49.938
No.

01:15:22.108 --> 01:15:25.595
Hey. I told you to
stay off my fucking bridge.

01:15:25.698 --> 01:15:29.426
This is my bridge! It's mine!

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:32.187
Get off my fucking bridge!

01:15:32.291 --> 01:15:35.156
You pay me my fucking toll.

01:15:35.259 --> 01:15:37.434
Pay me my fucking toll!

01:15:47.305 --> 01:15:49.411
Shit. Shit.

01:15:49.515 --> 01:15:53.174
Nice! Nice!

01:15:53.277 --> 01:15:55.348
Hey! Where's your dog?

01:15:57.867 --> 01:16:00.112
Hey, where's your fucking dog?!

01:16:32.765 --> 01:16:34.836
Just ran out of road.

01:16:37.183 --> 01:16:39.151
Listen, Jake.

01:16:39.254 --> 01:16:43.155
I know a guy
if you're looking for work.

01:16:43.258 --> 01:16:45.916
Luis' Lumber in Tehachapi.

01:16:48.505 --> 01:16:53.303
Look him up.
Luis in Tehachapi.

01:16:53.406 --> 01:16:56.202
If you're looking. For work.

01:17:02.483 --> 01:17:04.278
There's always more road.

01:18:00.232 --> 01:18:02.061
...weather together
on the fives

01:18:02.165 --> 01:18:03.718
as we head
into the holiday weekend.

01:18:03.822 --> 01:18:05.582
It's gonna be a spicy
Fourth of July.

01:18:05.686 --> 01:18:07.757
High temperatures into
the upper 90s in the Valley,

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.517
80s at the beaches.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.001
Let's go live to Bella Ericson
in our traffic...

01:18:51.835 --> 01:18:53.526
Santiago.

01:18:55.805 --> 01:18:57.876
What did you just call me?

01:18:57.979 --> 01:18:59.567
You heard me.

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:01.293
You got the wrong guy.

01:19:03.571 --> 01:19:06.608
It's about Socks.

01:19:06.712 --> 01:19:09.611
I don't wear any.

01:19:09.715 --> 01:19:12.891
So get off my fucking property.

01:19:12.994 --> 01:19:15.134
If you're still here
by the time I get back,

01:19:15.238 --> 01:19:16.826
I'm gonna cut you
in fuckin' half.

01:19:16.929 --> 01:19:19.104
You're not gonna do that.

01:19:19.207 --> 01:19:22.037
You won't because you don't
want them finding you.

01:19:22.141 --> 01:19:23.764
Who?

01:19:23.867 --> 01:19:26.214
The people who took our dog.

01:19:29.735 --> 01:19:31.599
Let's get a cup of coffee.

01:19:31.702 --> 01:19:34.394
I don't drink any.

01:19:34.498 --> 01:19:36.500
I gotta work.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.230
You wanna talk to me?

01:19:42.334 --> 01:19:43.991
Tag along.

01:19:50.135 --> 01:19:53.897
My indictment
is still under seal.

01:19:54.001 --> 01:19:56.175
- Yeah.
- How did you find me?

01:19:59.385 --> 01:20:01.284
You know I can't say.

01:20:11.224 --> 01:20:15.781
You can take your hand
off your gun now.

01:20:24.238 --> 01:20:27.448
I got a contract
with Forest Services.

01:20:27.551 --> 01:20:29.174
To clear out this shit.

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:36.008
When you see it...

01:20:36.112 --> 01:20:38.114
it looks healthy.

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.742
But inside...

01:20:45.846 --> 01:20:50.402
it's diseased, broken.

01:20:50.505 --> 01:20:54.439
I give it a new life like a--
a nice piece of glulam.

01:20:56.546 --> 01:20:58.997
Did you know that that shit
is stronger than steel?

01:20:59.099 --> 01:21:02.171
Santiago,
I don't have a lot of time.

01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:06.796
I gotta know what you and Socks
were mixed up in,

01:21:06.901 --> 01:21:08.558
where I can find her.

01:21:10.905 --> 01:21:13.908
She's a great fuckin' dog.

01:21:14.012 --> 01:21:16.082
The best.

01:21:19.534 --> 01:21:23.400
I had a family once.
She was part of it.

01:21:27.059 --> 01:21:29.096
Look what I did.

01:21:32.962 --> 01:21:36.930
You tell yourself
that they're family, but...

01:21:37.035 --> 01:21:38.933
they're just tools.

01:21:39.037 --> 01:21:40.970
Gotta realize that.

01:21:44.318 --> 01:21:46.285
What are you talking about?

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.571
She got sick.

01:22:01.507 --> 01:22:04.614
My daughter.

01:22:04.717 --> 01:22:08.135
I couldn't keep up.

01:22:08.238 --> 01:22:10.585
The co-pays and all that shit.

01:22:10.689 --> 01:22:12.483
They were charging me
thousands of dollars

01:22:12.587 --> 01:22:14.003
for the same painkillers

01:22:14.106 --> 01:22:16.590
I was confiscating
from those dudes downtown,

01:22:16.695 --> 01:22:19.284
you know, the ones
that shit their pants.

01:22:22.218 --> 01:22:24.427
I had to learn
how to make lemonade.

01:22:27.706 --> 01:22:29.397
Make ends meet.

01:22:36.749 --> 01:22:38.579
You got them their dogs.

01:22:40.857 --> 01:22:42.548
Yeah.

01:22:44.447 --> 01:22:47.001
Taught them how to--
how to use them.

01:22:47.105 --> 01:22:49.452
They'd fuck them up.

01:22:49.555 --> 01:22:54.802
They had them chasing highs
instead of tennis balls.

01:22:54.905 --> 01:22:58.633
But when I saw
what they did to Socks...

01:22:58.737 --> 01:23:00.290
she was half-dead.

01:23:00.394 --> 01:23:03.189
So I told 'em that she had
worms, that worms spread,

01:23:03.293 --> 01:23:05.226
that they will crawl
into your skin

01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:07.228
and make their way
up to your eyes

01:23:07.332 --> 01:23:08.919
and get into your brain,
which is true,

01:23:09.023 --> 01:23:10.576
but when they heard that shit...

01:23:12.647 --> 01:23:15.133
...they wanted nothing
to do with her.

01:23:17.099 --> 01:23:19.137
So I got her back.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.451
I got her clean.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.217
Where are they?

01:23:32.771 --> 01:23:34.497
Xiang Xi house?

01:23:34.599 --> 01:23:36.740
Xiang.

01:23:36.844 --> 01:23:38.673
Xiang Xi.

01:23:38.777 --> 01:23:40.468
There's a new opium war.

01:23:40.572 --> 01:23:42.539
The Chinese smuggle that shit
to Mexico,

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:45.232
and the cartels flood
that shit up though the border.

01:23:45.335 --> 01:23:46.680
They drop it right...

01:23:46.785 --> 01:23:49.201
in the actual dog shit,
right in the city.

01:23:49.305 --> 01:23:50.651
Nobody's gonna look at that.

01:23:50.754 --> 01:23:53.723
Nobody's gonna--
Who gives a shit about that?

01:23:53.826 --> 01:23:57.001
And the Satanistas sweat it
into street product.

01:23:57.106 --> 01:24:02.283
Anything anybody shoots,
smokes, snorts...

01:24:03.939 --> 01:24:06.598
The Chinese scratches.

01:24:06.701 --> 01:24:08.427
The most addictive thing
I've ever seen in my life.

01:24:08.531 --> 01:24:10.809
I've never seen
anything like that.

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:13.294
And we're to blame for that--
'cause if there's one thing

01:24:13.398 --> 01:24:15.676
that we're more addicted
than anything else...

01:24:15.778 --> 01:24:17.505
is addiction itself.

01:24:20.025 --> 01:24:21.715
Santiago.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.651
Where's Socks?

01:24:29.171 --> 01:24:31.588
Shit rolls downhill, Jake.

01:24:34.212 --> 01:24:36.421
Follow it.

01:24:38.388 --> 01:24:40.425
What about your daughter?

01:24:49.365 --> 01:24:52.608
When I realized I didn't have
the balls to shoot myself...

01:24:56.165 --> 01:24:58.615
...I gave Socks a button.

01:25:00.307 --> 01:25:03.379
The one thing
you never teach a K-9.

01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:54.041
I found her.
I'll text you the address.

01:26:59.495 --> 01:27:01.738
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:29:03.446 --> 01:29:05.068
Faas!

01:29:12.697 --> 01:29:14.768
Watch your back, Rosser.

01:29:27.712 --> 01:29:29.126
Aah!

01:30:25.183 --> 01:30:27.634
Hey, man.

01:30:27.737 --> 01:30:29.946
I just want my dog.

01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:31.983
She isn't yours anymore.

01:30:49.518 --> 01:30:52.728
Call her.
Go ahead. Call her.

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:58.803
Socks, here.

01:31:02.599 --> 01:31:04.774
Socks! Come!

01:31:08.226 --> 01:31:11.090
Socks. Here.

01:31:11.194 --> 01:31:13.024
Come here, girl! Come on!

01:31:16.545 --> 01:31:19.617
Socks. Come on.

01:31:31.662 --> 01:31:35.391
She belongs with me.

01:31:35.495 --> 01:31:37.186
Hm?

01:31:55.722 --> 01:31:58.241
- You're right.
- I know.

01:31:58.345 --> 01:32:00.830
She's yours.

01:32:00.934 --> 01:32:02.211
Fuck this.

01:32:02.314 --> 01:32:05.144
Kill me.
Put me out on my misery.

01:32:05.248 --> 01:32:06.905
Sic your dogs on me.

01:32:10.495 --> 01:32:13.912
What was it you said the other
day? "Our side or suicide"?

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.951
I guess it's suicide then, huh?

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:24.164
"Suicide."
That's a funny word, huh?

01:32:24.267 --> 01:32:26.028
Very.

01:32:26.131 --> 01:32:28.582
What is "suicide" in German?
You speak German, don't you?

01:32:28.686 --> 01:32:29.894
What is it?

01:32:29.997 --> 01:32:31.827
- Selbstmord.

01:32:59.474 --> 01:33:02.892
No answers yet about the
human remains of five victims

01:33:02.996 --> 01:33:05.550
discovered among
100 million tons of garbage

01:33:05.653 --> 01:33:07.310
in an area landfill.

01:33:07.414 --> 01:33:10.141
Investigators say the bodies
are so badly decomposed,

01:33:10.244 --> 01:33:12.799
it could take months
to uncover the identity

01:33:12.902 --> 01:33:14.766
of these victims, if ever.

01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:16.803
In our continuing coverage
of this story,

01:33:16.906 --> 01:33:19.460
we will, of course,
keep you updated.

01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.508
This is nothing.

01:33:32.612 --> 01:33:35.062
Did I ever tell you
how hot Iraq gets?

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:40.205
130. And I'm not talking
like two days a year.

01:33:40.309 --> 01:33:43.139
I'm talking about every
single day. 130 degrees.

01:33:43.242 --> 01:33:45.037
You can literally
fry an egg on a rock.

01:33:45.141 --> 01:33:47.143
You could have eggs all--
as many as you want.

01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:50.698
If you carried eggs around Iraq,
you know,

01:33:50.802 --> 01:33:52.701
you had a dozen eggs
for the day, you know,

01:33:52.804 --> 01:33:55.220
and, uh, you were just
walking around Iraq,

01:33:55.323 --> 01:33:58.776
you could literally fry up
an egg every single hour

01:33:58.879 --> 01:34:00.709
and have an egg, fried egg,
every single hour.

01:34:00.812 --> 01:34:02.331
You'd just throw it
on the ground--

01:34:02.434 --> 01:34:04.090
boom, you got a fried egg.

01:34:04.195 --> 01:34:06.197
If you carried some, you know,
rice and some beans,

01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.233
you'd have a little taco.

01:34:09.338 --> 01:34:12.134
I mean, not that you would
actually wanna eat it.

01:34:14.067 --> 01:34:15.516
Well, youactually might.

01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:17.691
You seem to want
to eat everything.

01:34:17.795 --> 01:34:19.831
Mama's waiting for us.
