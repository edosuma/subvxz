00:29.246 --> 00:31.509
- Guys, guys, guys.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.337
I have a superpower.

00:33.381 --> 00:36.514
I have a superpower!

00:36.558 --> 00:40.431
I think I speak for all of us
when I say, "Yeah, right."

00:43.086 --> 00:45.915
No, really. I'm invincible.

00:45.958 --> 00:49.353
Well, a very specific part
of my elbow is.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.094
See this little flap of skin?

00:51.138 --> 00:52.922
It doesn't hurt
when I pinch it.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.883
See? I feel nothing.

00:57.927 --> 01:01.235
- Oh, yeah. I gots
one of those things, too, yo.

01:01.278 --> 01:03.193
See? Don't feel
a thing neither.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.890
We've all got that.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.390
There's nothing special.
or super about it.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.546
Ah, man!

01:08.590 --> 01:11.549
I really thought I had
a super power this time.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.725
Oh, well, who wants to have
a pinching party?

01:13.769 --> 01:16.641
Pinching party!
Pinching party!

01:16.685 --> 01:19.079
Pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.080
Pinch, pinch,
pinch, pinch.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.429
Hey, easy on the pinching.

01:21.472 --> 01:24.084
No, it's okay.
You can't even feel it.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.216
We can't, but the Eebows can.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.392
Did you say "Eebows?"
Pinch, pinch.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.612
Pinch, pinch,
pinch, pinch.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.658
Pinch, pinch, pinch...

01:35.007 --> 01:36.007
Who said that?

01:39.447 --> 01:40.752
It was me.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.928
- What is that thing?

01:42.972 --> 01:44.582
That's an Eebow.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.758
I am no ordinary Eebow.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.326
I am Auggie,
emperor of the Eebows,

01:49.370 --> 01:52.764
and I am ordering you to
leave my Eebow brethren alone.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.289
But they are the so very cute.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.987
And so much fun to pinch.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.772
Pinch, pinch, pinch...
Enough!

02:00.816 --> 02:03.340
Eebows, emerge!

02:09.520 --> 02:12.262
Hey, I can't bend my arms.

02:12.306 --> 02:13.307
Me neither.

02:21.053 --> 02:23.055
They lock, no matter what I is.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.014
And I have the itch
upon my chin.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.495
And they're powerless to
do the scratching.

02:27.538 --> 02:30.715
Well, this is what happens
when you've got no Eebows
in your elbows.

02:30.759 --> 02:35.807
That is right,
because we are the ones
who allow all the bending.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.462
Great. We've all
learned something about
human anatomy today.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.334
Now, can you please
reattach to us,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.205
so we can get on with
our pinching party?

02:42.249 --> 02:45.077
No. There shall be
no more pinching.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.644
You mean like this?

02:46.688 --> 02:49.081
Perhaps, this is how he means.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.407
The pinch, the pinch,
the pinch...

02:50.431 --> 02:52.476
Cut it out. That is enough!

02:52.520 --> 02:54.174
No, it's not,

02:54.217 --> 02:56.219
'cause this pinching party's
going all night, baby.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.655
Pinch, pinch, pinch...

02:57.699 --> 02:59.222
Oh, my, God.
They're just so pinchable.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.528
Pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.530
I said enough!

03:04.793 --> 03:06.403
We help you eat.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.100
We help you brush your teeth.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.015
We bend over backwards for you,

03:10.059 --> 03:12.061
and this is how you repay us?

03:12.104 --> 03:13.715
With pinching parties?

03:13.758 --> 03:16.370
Well, the party is over.

03:16.413 --> 03:20.243
Come on, Eebows. Let's ditch
these insufferable ingrates.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.203
Yeah? Well, there's
nothing special
about you anyway.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.421
We don't need you,

03:24.465 --> 03:28.208
you useless flaps of meat!

03:28.251 --> 03:31.602
Useless flaps of meat? Wow.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.039
Wow!

03:34.083 --> 03:35.867
Great. Now what?

03:35.911 --> 03:37.956
I don't know.
It's not that big a deal.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.569
Without the Eebows,
we cannot do
the bending of the arms.

03:41.612 --> 03:42.961
It's all locked up.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.615
Don't worry, Titans.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.270
We've overcome
bigger challenges
than this before,

03:47.314 --> 03:50.230
and I'm sure that
with a little bit of patience
and perseverance,

03:50.273 --> 03:53.058
we can all go on to lead
perfectly normal lives.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.930
You'll see...

03:58.194 --> 04:01.153
Here, brushie, brushie, brush.

04:01.197 --> 04:04.331
I can't do
my push-ups.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.990
Uh...

04:17.431 --> 04:20.390
Help! I can't wipe my bum-bum!

04:20.434 --> 04:23.828
Titans, I was wrong about
not needing Eebows.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.961
Life has proven difficult
without them.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.398
Never knew how important
those little flaps
of meat were, yo.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.574
- You can say that again.

04:30.618 --> 04:34.143
We need to find our Eebows
and forced them to
reattach themselves.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.017
Ingrates of Jump City,

04:39.061 --> 04:41.672
no longer
will you hold us captive

04:41.716 --> 04:43.413
under the crevices
of your arms.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.502
Those who do the bending

04:45.546 --> 04:47.809
will bend to you no more.

04:47.852 --> 04:50.246
Eebows, emerge!

04:59.342 --> 05:01.039
The Eebows are
rising up.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.129
And the arms of the people
are locking up.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.655
Listen, Auggie,
this needs to stop. Now!

05:07.698 --> 05:11.528
You're no match
for my army of Eebows.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.444
We have the power
to bend anything.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.316
Eebows, eliminate them.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.362
There's so many of them.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.893
Ow! Ow!

05:46.520 --> 05:48.478
Excellent work, Eebows.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.915
Now, join me.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.191
By combining our powers,

06:06.235 --> 06:10.500
we can bend the very fabric
of space and time itself.

06:12.763 --> 06:15.897
- What's happening?
- We need cover.
Quick, under here.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.256
What is this place?

06:31.086 --> 06:33.567
It's some sort of Eebow city.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.612
When Auggie bent
the space time continuum,

06:35.656 --> 06:37.397
he must have created
an alternate reality

06:37.440 --> 06:38.876
where Eebows reign supreme.

06:38.920 --> 06:43.141
They really did it.
Those maniacs!

06:43.185 --> 06:46.318
Curse them. Curse them all!

06:50.975 --> 06:52.455
What is that?

06:52.499 --> 06:53.804
I think it's
some kind of alarm.

07:01.769 --> 07:04.249
The Eebow Council
will see you now.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.816
Eebow Council?

07:05.860 --> 07:09.559
Ow! Keep your filthy mitts
off us, you dirty... Ow!

07:09.603 --> 07:12.257
Stop, stop. Stop that.
Too hard. Ow!

07:12.301 --> 07:13.955
Well, well, well.

07:13.998 --> 07:18.002
If it isn't
those wretched pinchers,
the Teen Titans.

07:18.046 --> 07:22.442
This council finds you guilty
of crimes against Eebows.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.748
And as punishment
for your vile acts,

07:24.792 --> 07:28.273
you are now sentenced to
a lifetime of bending.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.146
What do you want us
to bend, yo?

07:31.189 --> 07:33.104
Everything.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.890
You, bend over and be my chair.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.808
You, bend over and be my table.

07:42.505 --> 07:48.163
You, bend this penne pasta
into elbow macaroni.

07:48.206 --> 07:52.472
You, bend over backward
and pick up my fork.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.823
You, bend my straw.

07:55.866 --> 07:58.652
Bend the knee.
Put a bend in the road.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.175
Bend the rules.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.352
Bend an ear.

08:03.395 --> 08:06.486
Bend this, bend that,
bend here, bend there.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.401
Bend, bend, bend!

08:09.445 --> 08:12.709
This bending
be too much, yo.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.972
I am the all bended out.

08:15.016 --> 08:18.541
Can't. Bend. Anymore.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.501
Fine. Take a short break.
You look thirsty.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.373
Why don't you get yourself
a drink of water?

08:43.566 --> 08:47.178
That's so funny.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.571
Oh, it hurts.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.182
Of course. Everyone has
a weakness.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.054
For Eebows,
it's their funny bones.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.708
If we get them to
laugh hard enough,

08:54.751 --> 08:56.013
maybe we can break it.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.667
Titans, make 'em laugh.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.470
- Ow!

09:23.301 --> 09:24.520
Ow!

09:45.323 --> 09:46.760
Okay.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.239
Okay, please stop.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.241
You've broken
all of our funny bones.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.766
We'll do whatever you want.

09:52.809 --> 09:56.073
So you'll reattach to us
and unbend reality?

09:56.117 --> 09:57.945
Yes, yes, oh...

09:57.988 --> 09:59.903
Just please don't
make us laugh anymore.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.644
Ow!

10:05.561 --> 10:08.738
Oh, it feels so good to
bend our arms again.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.611
It's funny how you can take
something so small for granted.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.265
It's also funny watching Robin
trying to drink water,

10:14.309 --> 10:16.093
and spilling it
all over his face.

10:16.137 --> 10:19.793
Yeah!
That was a real knee-slapper.

10:24.580 --> 10:28.366
We are the Kneebows
and we demand that
you stop slapping us.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.194
Oh, no. Not again.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.457
I can't feel my legs.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.416
Ah, get back here!
