supposed to do? You know?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.992
So now I'm hoping,
we're both hoping,

19:45.840 --> 19:49.515
that we can just
smooth this all over now,

19:49.600 --> 19:52.274
and everything can
go back to normal.

didn't want beans, didn't you?

really. Good, good stuff.

you know,

20:20.320 --> 20:22.789

that's no small thing.

stab the hostage?

21:05.720 --> 21:07.233
(WHISPERING) Yes. Yes.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.277
I mean, I had to teach him
some manners is all.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.591
If we're gonna be spending
time together. And him so angry.

Help me.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.473
Hon, hon.
Hmm?

21:28.400 --> 21:32.189
They're not gonna want him
back if we cut him up too much.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.714
Oh, I hardly
stuck him at all.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.870
I'm hurt real bad.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.950
Shut up.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.439
I think she punctured a lung.

21:37.520 --> 21:40.638
How'd it go with the family?
They gonna negotiate?

21:41.400 --> 21:43.471
Had to leave them
a message.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.631
Well, you said
we had him?

21:45.720 --> 21:48.519
Yeah, but it was just like
a flunky or something.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.398
So I said I'd call back.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.437
Okay, well,
maybe there's...

21:52.520 --> 21:54.989
Sounds like there's
a war going on up there.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.718
Maybe they're busy.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.629
Yeah, but, I mean, if he's
such an important guy...

21:59.720 --> 22:02.439

22:02.520 --> 22:04.511
Don't doubt yourself, Ed.

22:04.600 --> 22:08.070
That was my undoing.
See it, then be it, right?

22:09.280 --> 22:13.399

beans and call back.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.080

next time for sure.
