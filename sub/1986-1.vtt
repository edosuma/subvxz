01:02.320 --> 01:04.638
When I was a kid,
my brother and I used to

01:04.640 --> 01:09.031
pretend we were heroes with swords.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.743
We were the only ones
who could save the day.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.945
But perhaps we set
the bar a little bit high.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.466
Maybe we're just regular people.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.519
The ones who get saved.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.791
Dad?

02:00.040 --> 02:01.985
What's your password?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.559
What?

02:04.560 --> 02:10.509
I said, what's your password?

02:16.120 --> 02:17.399
Dad!

02:17.400 --> 02:19.399
I have no fucking idea!

02:19.400 --> 02:20.719
Swear jar.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.039
Fuck the swear jar.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.319
- Aidan.
- I'm sorry, but fuck the swear jar.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.239
That word means sex. You're gonna
have sex with the swear jar?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.039
Okay, Tucker, that's enough, honey.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.319
The code's 1234. What are you doing?

02:31.320 --> 02:33.239
The swear jar is full. Look at it.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.879
The swear jar is all the money

02:34.880 --> 02:36.519
we have to send you to college,

02:36.520 --> 02:38.670
so you should be happy I curse.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.267
I heard you, Dad.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.239
Rabbi Perlman says that cursing
is for the simple-minded.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.239
Well, Rabbi Perlman's
breath is so bad,

02:45.240 --> 02:48.599
it makes God question why he even
bothered creating the universe.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.159
Rabbi Perlman's
praying and God's like,

02:50.160 --> 02:52.679
"Please stop, Perlman.
You're welcome.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.386
"You're welcome!"

02:54.760 --> 02:57.159
Well, if you can curse, then we all
can curse. Is that what you want?

02:57.160 --> 02:59.503
- Fine.
- No!

02:59.760 --> 03:01.944
Grace is not gonna curse.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.599
Fuckhead.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.639
Wow!

03:05.640 --> 03:06.919
- Gracie!
- Whoa!

03:06.920 --> 03:08.359
Mom, Dad said that the other day

03:08.360 --> 03:09.759
when someone stole his parking spot.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.719
I did say that, babe,
but he was a fuckhead.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.399
He was in a yellow Hummer.
Who drives a yellow Hummer?

03:14.400 --> 03:16.239
What, is he going to war on the sun?

03:16.240 --> 03:18.439
Dad, we need this car.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.599
We are not getting an Aston Martin.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.799
But for the next minute only,
you can curse.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.959
Then, hairy balls.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.462
Okay. Come on, guys.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.789
Up, up, up. Seat belts.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.719
Tucker! Yarmulke. Tzitzit.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.599
Oh, come on. What is
wrong with you, man?

03:39.600 --> 03:40.679
Get it together.

03:40.680 --> 03:41.959
I was thinking about
that Aston Martin.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.239
Stop thinking about that car.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.399
It's time to start thinking
about the plight of the Jews.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.879
- What does "plight" mean?
- I have no idea.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.799
Ask the rabbis. That's what
we're paying them for.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.479
Aidan, you have to talk
to your father today.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.919
He still hasn't paid
this semester's tuition.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.079
I hate talking to him about money.
When was it due?

03:55.080 --> 03:56.439
Months ago.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.439
Okay, and they're threatening
to kick the kids out of school

03:58.440 --> 03:59.839
if they don't get a check
by the end of this week.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.399
Maybe it's time we put
them in public school.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.479
- No!
- Yay!

04:02.480 --> 04:04.679
Oh, no, no, no, we're not
putting them in the public school.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.944
I'll talk to him today, okay?

04:07.320 --> 04:08.959
Avoid the rabbis if you see them.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.359
I always do!

04:10.360 --> 04:11.919
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye, baby.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.660
Bye!

04:17.839 --> 04:19.421
Bye, sweetie.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.679
You need help gearing
up back there, Yentl?

04:31.680 --> 04:33.359
Don't call me Yentl.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.759
You can call me Yentl.
I love that movie.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.386
I know. I know.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.479
The boys get to do all the
cool things to honor HaShem,

04:40.480 --> 04:44.039
and I won't get to do anything
remotely cool until I buy my sheitel.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.759
Sheitel? What's that again?

04:45.760 --> 04:47.559
It's a modesty wig.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.359
So, when I get married,
I'll shave my head

04:50.360 --> 04:52.639
and wear a wig for
the rest of my life.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.559
That way only my husband
will find me pretty.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.639
No offense, but that's the weirdest
tradition I've ever heard of.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.039
And it wouldn't even work on
you because you're so pretty

05:00.040 --> 05:02.799
that you'd look even
prettier with a shaved head.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.428
So, it would defeat
the whole purpose.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.904
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.751
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.906
Hey, guys.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.783
Tucker. Come here. Drill.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.911
I knew it.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.628
I told you. Drill stays at home.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.742
Thank you.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.359
Now go be Jewish.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.359
Why? It's so boring.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.399
I have no idea. Ask the rabbis.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.959
Shalom.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.900
I got it right here.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.239
Oh, come on.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.439
Sorry, just give me a second!

05:58.400 --> 05:59.559
Shalom, Mr. Bloom.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.062
Hey, Rabbi Rosenberg.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.919
Mr. Bloom, Rabbi Twersky

06:03.920 --> 06:05.919
would like to see you in his
office if you have a moment.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.359
Oh, you know, today I can't.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.759
Today, believe it or not,

06:08.760 --> 06:10.759
a moment is something
I just don't have.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.119
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.199
Speaking of rain, as you know,

06:14.200 --> 06:17.119
every year to celebrate the
holiday of Tu Bishevat,

06:17.120 --> 06:18.759
we ask the children to donate money

06:18.760 --> 06:20.599
to have a tree planted in Israel.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.639
Yeah, I heard about that, Rabbi.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.679
But when you think
about it, how many trees

06:24.680 --> 06:26.639
do they really need over there?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.999
I feel like Israel is
pretty good on trees.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.479
Which is why, Mr. Bloom,

06:30.480 --> 06:33.950
we encourage the children to plant
a seedling in their own backyard.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.062
You never picked up
your seedling, Mr. Bloom.

06:37.160 --> 06:41.799
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
Oh, there it is. Okay. Thank you.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.984
Just try not to smoke it.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.221
Clever.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.759
Baruch Hashem.

06:47.760 --> 06:52.151
Yes, bless God. Bless everybody.

06:53.960 --> 06:58.988
I ask you, sir. How many
bangs did Jesus hear?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.799
This entire case is
dependent on your testimony

07:01.800 --> 07:05.509
that on the night of January 7th...

07:09.840 --> 07:14.265
This shit is horrible.
In college, I did Othello.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.679
We all did.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.341
Yup.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.839
Aidan, Paul.

07:24.840 --> 07:27.799
Can I just speak to you both
here for a quick second?

07:27.800 --> 07:31.031
Yeah, sure. Hey, Terry.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.719
Uh... Didn't your agents call you?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.959
We've decided to go
African-American with the role.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.399
Oh. You've got to be kidding me, man.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.479
I've been memorizing this all week.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.551
Does he have to be
a dark black person?

07:45.280 --> 07:47.908
What if he were light-skinned?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.119
Uh...

07:49.120 --> 07:50.679
I'm sorry, guys.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What about Ortega?

07:52.960 --> 07:55.239
Ortega, there's a guy on
the witness stand, Ortega.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.230
He's an older Hispanic man.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.581
Hola, seÃ±or.

08:01.360 --> 08:05.945
I am on the witness stand
and I only heard one bang.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.941
Uno bang.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.679
There was only one uno bang.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.519
Not three. Uno.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.399
Aidan, please tell me you're not

08:15.400 --> 08:17.279
trying to be an older Hispanic man.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.879
I'm just trying to show
you my range, man.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.519
I really, really need a part.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.227
I'm sorry, guys, all right?

08:24.840 --> 08:28.479
If it's any consolation,
I thought you were Hispanic.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.505
- Gracias.
- De nada.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.780
Fuck!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.519
Oh, yeah, do me like that.

08:44.520 --> 08:47.399
Come on, harder, harder! Oh, yeah.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.947
Catch you at a bad time?

08:49.040 --> 08:51.439
Dad, what the hell?

08:51.440 --> 08:53.465
Trouble in the bedroom, Aidan?

08:54.280 --> 08:57.639
Men have man needs.
Those man needs need to be met.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.079
Well, Sarah doesn't really care
about my man needs right now, Dad.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.199
We have a lot going on.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.159
So, you're taking things into
your own hands, so to speak.

09:04.160 --> 09:07.599
Hilarious. Why haven't you
paid the yeshiva tuition, Dad?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.479
I have aggro rabbis
stalking me in crosswalks.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.079
It's like an Orthodox zombie movie.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.799
We need to talk. But can you
please clean yourself up first?

09:14.800 --> 09:16.599
I can't talk to you with
your pants at your ankles.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.261
Fine.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.302
Kugel, no. Kugel!

09:27.160 --> 09:28.359
Sorry.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.719
I know you can't stand the dog.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.239
He's usually so well trained.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.239
If you trained that dog to
piss everywhere but the lawn,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.559
then you did an incredible job.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.425
Pool looks good.

09:38.520 --> 09:41.466
What are you growing,
typhoid or hepatitis?

09:42.320 --> 09:45.266
What's going on with the fence?

09:45.640 --> 09:48.599
You have a nice little slice
of Mumbai back here, Aidan.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.839
The yard has been this
way since we moved in.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.999
Are you gonna comment on
it every time you see it?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.359
I haven't gotten a decent check

09:54.360 --> 09:55.719
since I did that dandruff commercial.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.826
Ironically, you still have dandruff.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.839
What is going on with
the tuition checks, Dad?

10:03.840 --> 10:05.839
We had a deal.
You said you'd cover it

10:05.840 --> 10:08.079
as long as you got to pick the school.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.359
And you did.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.759
You have your indoctrinated,

10:11.760 --> 10:13.439
little religious grandchildren.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.679
You cannot make me hound
you for these checks.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.944
The cancer's back, Aidan.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.067
I didn't want to worry
you till I knew for sure.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.828
- But now you do.
- Now I do.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.586
And it's pretty bad.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.399
How bad is "pretty bad"?

10:32.400 --> 10:35.439
It's metastasized
from my lungs, spreading.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.959
Oh, my God.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.622
Found this place out in Malibu.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.719
Treats your own stem
cells and then injects

10:41.720 --> 10:43.839
them right back into you.
Good as new.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.229
But I'm going to have
to pay out of pocket.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.399
So...

10:50.400 --> 10:53.631
So, I can't afford the
school anymore, Aidan.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.919
I'm down to my last savings and
I decided to spend it on this.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.421
So, you win.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.359
My father has cancer, my children
have to drop out of school,

11:03.360 --> 11:06.639
and I don't have a job.
How could I possibly be winning?

11:06.640 --> 11:09.079
God works in mysterious ways.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.599
This is particularly mysterious.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.023
Oh, one more thing.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.839
I'm gonna be laid up for a while.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.759
I'm gonna need you to watch Kugel.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.504
Oh! There's so much
bad news all at once.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.719
What do we do?

11:26.720 --> 11:31.270
What do you mean, "What do we do?"
We move forward.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.391
It's the only direction God gave us.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.471
Hi, sweetie.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.951
Noah!

11:48.520 --> 11:51.830
I know you're in there.
I can hear you trolling.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.159
Noah, I'm not leaving!

11:59.160 --> 12:00.279
Go away!

12:00.280 --> 12:03.067
Dude, I drove all the way out here.
Open the fucking door.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.159
What's the password?

12:05.160 --> 12:06.239
Um... Is it,

12:06.240 --> 12:09.159
"Your father's dying and
I need to talk to you"?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.639
I knew that was it.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.427
Sunlight, Noah. Noah, sunlight.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.319
Is Dad really dying again or
are you just crying wolf?

12:25.320 --> 12:28.919
It's all over his body, Noah.
The wolf is here.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.719
Kugel, no!

12:33.720 --> 12:35.199
No, no, no, don't stop him.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.159
I can't stand that fucking guy.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.439
Get over here. Kugel!

12:40.960 --> 12:42.541
Lie down.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.941
Your can looks good.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.079
You know when you make
fun of my trailer, Aidan,

12:50.080 --> 12:51.999
you're making fun of
my inheritance from Mom.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.679
She wanted me to live how I choose.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.919
And to be free to pursue
the goals that I have.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.239
And what are those goals?

12:57.240 --> 12:58.559
I thought you were gonna, like,

12:58.560 --> 13:00.199
develop an iPhone app or something.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.359
No, no, fuck apps. Fuck apps.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.759
It's a saturated market.
I'm gonna start blogging.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.599
Look, I have two problems and one,

13:06.600 --> 13:08.039
I think you might be
able to help me with.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.199
- What?
- Kugel.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.479
- Fuck off.
- Dude, I can't raise two kids

13:11.480 --> 13:13.279
and go on auditions and
take care of this dog.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.039
Absolutely not.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.199
Are you kidding me?
This is our father.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.719
Our father. You have
to rally with me.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.599
Oh. Okay. So,
when you get old and sick,

13:22.600 --> 13:25.239
everybody's just supposed to
forget that you were an asshole?

13:25.240 --> 13:26.799
I know he's not easy.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.599
Trust me, no one knows
that better than me.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.879
What's the other one?

13:30.880 --> 13:31.919
What?

13:31.920 --> 13:33.479
You said that there were
two problems, Aidan.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.479
I will help you with the
one that's not that dog.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.119
The other one is that

13:37.120 --> 13:39.719
he's gonna try an
experimental treatment now,

13:39.720 --> 13:42.439
and he can't afford to send the
kids to the yeshiva anymore.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.386
Well, it sounds like you
really got your hands full.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.519
Live long and prosper.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.399
- Are you serious?
- I gotta get back to work.

13:49.400 --> 13:53.063
A blogger never rests.
Don't you dare leave that dog.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.799
...as he searches for his first love.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.586
What a beautiful tortoise.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.319
Can I say something that's
probably gonna piss you off?

14:08.320 --> 14:09.946
I can't wait.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.826
Why don't you homeschool them?

14:13.800 --> 14:16.348
Are you kidding me?
What are we, Amish?

14:16.800 --> 14:20.759
I've been looking online and there's
a whole new movement out there.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.239
Cities that public
schools are suffering,

14:23.240 --> 14:25.902
some parents are
considering other options.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.799
Dad, can we buy drugs
at our public school?

14:28.800 --> 14:29.839
What?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.679
Uncle Noah said he used to buy
drugs at his public school.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.719
No, man, that was the '90s.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.599
This is LA. There's a weed
pharmacy on every corner.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.119
All you need is 50
bucks and a headache.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.199
- Honey, don't tell him that.
- If you're implying

14:41.200 --> 14:42.919
you want me to give up acting,
you should just say it.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.399
I think you should give up acting.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.839
I will not give up acting.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.319
We can't afford private school,

14:47.320 --> 14:48.679
you're afraid of public school.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.119
It's the middle of the school year.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.599
You want to just drop these two
little indoctrinated matzo balls

14:53.600 --> 14:55.799
into a school that's ranked
last in the district?

14:55.800 --> 14:58.985
I agree with you,
but what's your plan, Dad?

14:59.160 --> 15:01.599
Grace, what's the Hebrew
word for charity again?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.467
Tzedakah.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.825
Tzedakah.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.549
Mr. Bloom, Baruch Hashem.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.030
Please have a seat.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.102
Do you ever watch these YouTubes?

15:42.960 --> 15:45.542
YouTube? Yes, I've seen YouTube.

15:46.200 --> 15:51.547
This kitten will not allow his
brother to sleep, no matter what.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.231
You know kittens,
they're always doing something.

15:55.520 --> 16:00.199
Mr. Bloom, please,
can I help you today?

16:00.200 --> 16:01.919
Well, Rabbi, as I'm sure you know,

16:01.920 --> 16:06.519
my father has been paying
our tuition here at Hillel.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.879
Unfortunately, he's taken ill

16:09.880 --> 16:12.679
and he can no longer afford
to cover us anymore.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.627
Oh, yes, I've been
counseling your father.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.559
I am deeply sorry about his illness.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.079
Thank you.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.639
I hope you're not withdrawing
the children from this school.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.039
That's the thing.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.559
We could only afford to
go here with his help.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.063
Ah, yes. You're the actor.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.399
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

16:37.400 --> 16:41.586
And your wife provides for the family

16:41.760 --> 16:44.199
while you act.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.781
Yes.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.239
But I was hoping that
you might consider

16:50.240 --> 16:52.230
giving us a little

16:54.280 --> 16:55.519
tzedakah.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.022
A tzedakah.

16:58.680 --> 17:04.759
Mr. Bloom, if you want
to buy a gallon of milk

17:04.760 --> 17:08.559
when you only have enough
money for a glass of milk,

17:08.560 --> 17:13.799
you must first take that
money from somewhere else.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.999
So, maybe you decided that

17:18.000 --> 17:21.742
this week you will give up honey.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.118
I'm not a honey guy, but go on.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.118
If I give you charity,

17:26.119 --> 17:30.639
I must take away funds from
one of the several families

17:30.640 --> 17:33.759
to whom we currently
provide assistance.

17:33.760 --> 17:37.959
Families who actually
need the assistance.

17:37.960 --> 17:42.879
Not just someone who's made
a choice to be an actor

17:42.880 --> 17:46.639
and thusly cannot
provide for his family.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.319
But what about my dream?

17:48.320 --> 17:50.999
I mean, doesn't God believe
in my pursuit of happiness?

17:51.000 --> 17:55.119
No! That's the Declaration
of Independence.

17:55.120 --> 17:59.479
Thomas Jefferson cared
about your happiness.

17:59.480 --> 18:04.519
God wants you to provide
for your family, Mr. Bloom.

18:04.520 --> 18:10.823
God believes your family
deserves both milk and honey.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.541
Well, thank you.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.901
Thank you.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.239
I'm sorry to interrupt, Rabbi.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.185
I'm sorry to interrupt
everyone. Grace!

18:52.400 --> 18:54.399
Tucker, wake up!

18:54.400 --> 18:56.599
Grace, Tucker, come on.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.359
Put a wiggle in it. Come on.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.599
Let's go, please. So sorry,
everyone. It's beautiful.

19:01.600 --> 19:06.105
Shalom. Sayonara. Keep it real.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.199
But I don't want to leave school.
I like it there.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.919
And what about all my friends?

19:10.920 --> 19:12.799
You'll make new friends, okay?
Better friends.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.439
It's a horrible idea.
You don't know anything.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.159
What are you gonna teach them?
How to do the acting?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.399
There's websites, Dad. There's books.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.399
It's only till the end of
the semester. We'll be fine.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.719
You're burdening them
with your fears.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.199
Just 'cause you got beat up in the
public school doesn't mean they will.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.279
You got beat up?

19:31.280 --> 19:32.439
- No. No.
- Oh, yes.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.999
Tell them the truth.
They picked on him.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.759
With his Dungeons & Dragons

19:37.760 --> 19:39.079
and scientific-fiction movies.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.279
I got in one fight.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.999
You marry a half-Jew, you provide
your children with absolutely

19:43.000 --> 19:45.559
no sense of spirituality or
faith in a higher power.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.079
Now, for dessert,
you spoon-feed them all your fears.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.150
It's a mess, Aidan.

19:59.560 --> 20:04.239
Sweetie, look at the
outfit I got you today.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.959
How cute is this?

20:05.960 --> 20:07.319
I'm not wearing that.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.399
Really?

20:08.400 --> 20:11.919
I thought it was so cute and...

20:11.920 --> 20:15.959
Mom, do my clothes embarrass you?

20:15.960 --> 20:19.759
No. No.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.864
Really, honey, they don't.

20:22.640 --> 20:26.479
No, I want you to be
whoever you want to be.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.159
"Whomever."

20:28.160 --> 20:30.230
Whomever.

20:30.680 --> 20:34.309
Then why do you want me to dress
like I'm on the Disney Channel?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.359
I just thought that since
you're not going to yeshiva

20:40.360 --> 20:44.342
that you might want to try
something more colorful.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.981
What do you think?

20:46.440 --> 20:48.799
I think that...

20:49.880 --> 20:53.702
That God is testing
my faith right now.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.346
And I probably shouldn't
make any drastic changes.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.999
I'm sorry, Mom.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.839
No, don't be sorry. It's fine.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.911
It's fine. Let's just
forget about it.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.664
It's silly of me.

21:14.840 --> 21:19.639
I'm gonna pray that God
helps Dad get a job and...

21:19.640 --> 21:20.919
Mmm. Yeah.

21:20.920 --> 21:24.981
...that Uncle Noah's
anti-depressants start to work.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.550
And that you get happy, too.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.542
I'm happy, sweetie.

21:32.600 --> 21:36.582
Mom, no, you're not.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.759
I know you're a hermit
and everything,

21:46.760 --> 21:48.439
but if you don't stop that
fucking dog from barking,

21:48.440 --> 21:50.879
I am going to roll your
trailer off the cliff.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.959
Kugel, shut the fuck up!

22:00.360 --> 22:02.079
Why are you wearing Muppet pants?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.199
They're not Muppet pants.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.159
I'm working on my
outfit for Comic-Con.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.399
Are you a Furry?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.039
I hate that term.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.439
I'm a character designer
of full-size plush toys.

22:11.440 --> 22:12.759
So you're a Furry.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.919
Do you ever leave this trailer?

22:14.920 --> 22:16.919
Are you always so abrasive?

22:16.920 --> 22:20.039
Well, does your trailer
always smell like

22:20.040 --> 22:22.399
the Burger King himself ate Grimace

22:22.400 --> 22:24.519
and then shit him out all
over your living room?

22:24.520 --> 22:27.079
Grimace is in Ronald
McDonald's posse.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.319
Originally introduced in
November 1971 as "Evil Grimace."

22:30.320 --> 22:32.982
You're mixing up your
fast-food character lore.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.119
The fact that you know that

22:35.120 --> 22:37.599
has told me everything I
need to know about you.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.479
You know, when your
brother was six years old,

23:03.480 --> 23:05.391
we thought something
was wrong with him.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.319
I remember a psychologist at school

23:08.320 --> 23:10.439
gave him this battery of tests.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.599
When they come out, she says,

23:12.600 --> 23:15.341
"He's not disabled. He's a genius."

23:16.080 --> 23:19.119
I remember strutting around and I was
going about my business thinking,

23:19.120 --> 23:21.145
"I'm the father of a genius."

23:22.440 --> 23:24.439
Do you have any idea
how much pride I felt?

23:24.440 --> 23:26.021
A lot.

23:26.080 --> 23:31.507
I imagined us working together side
by side at the university one day.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.199
High hopes.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.719
Why is it that whenever we're alone,

23:34.720 --> 23:36.159
all you want to talk about is Noah?

23:36.160 --> 23:38.199
I can't even have a conversation
with him. I say hello, he says,

23:38.200 --> 23:40.429
"How do you say
hello to me like that?"

23:40.720 --> 23:42.679
Do you mind if I pick you
up after your treatment?

23:42.680 --> 23:44.799
I have an audition that
I really want to go to.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.559
This auditioning, when are
you gonna give that up?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.319
I don't know, Dad. But not yet.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.399
Well, you can hardly call
yourself head of the household.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.719
- Thank you.
- I know it's 2014.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.479
In my time, men would rather die

23:55.480 --> 23:56.679
than let his wife work
her fingers to the bone

23:56.680 --> 23:57.839
while he clowns around.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.519
Okay, "clowns around."
You're forgetting

23:59.520 --> 24:01.039
something that's very important,

24:01.040 --> 24:03.399
and that is that Sarah loves her job.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.439
She is living her dream.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.387
Sometimes when I forget
to wear my underpants,

24:10.400 --> 24:13.824
I get, like,
these little half-boners.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.544
You know, like, aspirational boners.

24:18.920 --> 24:23.823
"Someday I'm gonna grow up and
I'm gonna be a full-on boner."

24:24.200 --> 24:27.271
Hmm. "Just have to work hard enough."

24:30.200 --> 24:34.068
That was the half-boner talking.
I was doing his voice.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.430
I figured that out, Jerry.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.959
Can you please stop talking?

24:39.960 --> 24:41.719
'Cause I have a
shit-ton of work to do.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.905
And I, um, appreciate it.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.879
Want a back massage?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.839
Will you please shut the fuck up?

24:48.840 --> 24:50.399
You're so fucking inappropriate.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.426
This is not a frat house, Jerry.
It is a place of business.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.950
Whoa. Easy, Jane Fonda.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.119
Just trying to have some fun at work.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.759
Believe it or not, I don't
want to know about your dick.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.959
Well, my dick doesn't want
to know about you, either.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.519
- Good.
- How's that?

25:04.520 --> 25:08.263
Yeah. So now we're ignoring you.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.039
Hi, Jesse.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.159
Hi, Grace.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.439
How come you're not in school?

25:24.440 --> 25:25.959
Bomb scare. What about you?

25:25.960 --> 25:27.959
We're gonna be homeschooled.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.359
Are you Amish?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.999
No, we're Jewish.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.439
But we just can't afford
private school anymore.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.559
But I thought Jews ran Hollywood.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.239
I thought so, too.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.039
Maybe we're in the wrong
tribe or something.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.719
Anyway, it's just till the end of the year.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.359
I'm gonna go to Roosevelt
for seventh grade.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.999
- Me, too!
- Really?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.150
- Yeah.
- Cool.

25:50.240 --> 25:54.319
Hey, um, so my sister always has
this big end-of-the-year pool party.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.319
It's usually pretty awesome.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.821
Do you want to come?

25:58.320 --> 26:01.559
No, thank you. I never
learned how to swim.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.789
And I don't even have a bathing suit.

26:03.840 --> 26:04.999
Why not?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.159
Well, God says that a woman's

26:06.160 --> 26:08.150
supposed to keep her body covered up.

26:08.640 --> 26:13.145
Okay, well, I guess you got a few
months if you change your mind, so...

26:13.680 --> 26:15.989
Right. Cool.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.359
Yeah. Okay, well, I'll see you later.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.439
Yeah. See ya.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.479
Okay.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.823
- Bye.
- Bye, Jesse.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.199
Okay, good morning, students.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.639
- Good morning.
- Goodbye.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.799
Okay, we'll start with attendance.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.159
- Grace.
- Here!

26:36.160 --> 26:37.999
And Too-ker?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.599
This is boring already.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.999
Oh. We'll take that as a "here."

26:42.000 --> 26:44.719
Okay, I wanna focus on what
you're doing in school.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.159
Grace, what are you currently
working on in school?

26:48.160 --> 26:49.199
Geometry.

26:49.200 --> 26:52.639
Geometry, geometry

26:52.640 --> 26:55.519
This is the song for geometry

26:55.520 --> 27:00.879
Okay, who knows what this guy is?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.719
- Triangle!
- Great!

27:02.720 --> 27:04.839
No extra points for yelling,
but you are correct.

27:04.840 --> 27:05.879
Yay, recess!

27:05.880 --> 27:09.199
No, no, no, no recess. Back, back,
back, no recess. Thank you.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.719
And can you please sit on
your ass and not your head?

27:11.720 --> 27:13.439
An ass is a donkey.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.319
That's correct.
You get an A in biology.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.639
- Dad?
- Yes.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.159
I'm in honors math.

27:18.160 --> 27:21.519
We're learning things like supplementary
and complimentary angles,

27:21.520 --> 27:25.399
determining the area of a
three-dimensional shape, circumferences.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.879
I know all that, Grace.
We're starting with...

27:27.880 --> 27:29.719
We're starting with some
of the basic stuff,

27:29.720 --> 27:31.919
and then going to the
good stuff, you know?

27:31.920 --> 27:33.879
You go see Sting in concert,

27:33.880 --> 27:36.359
he's not gonna just jump
into The Police songs.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.919
You're gonna have to
hear a couple hours of

27:37.920 --> 27:39.879
some wacky stuff with the dizzery-do.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.479
Dad, I have to take a choom.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.559
What's a choom?

27:42.560 --> 27:44.199
It's how we say "shit" in school.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.279
- Swear jar!
- I don't have any money.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.279
See, that's where the whole swear
jar thing falls apart for me.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.919
I'm the only one
putting money into it.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.719
It's Hebrew for "brown."

27:51.720 --> 27:52.879
Oh.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.119
Got it!

27:54.120 --> 27:58.319
You are free to leave the
classroom for your brown. Enjoy.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.959
Grace, is this triangle
complimentary?

28:01.960 --> 28:04.719
Or is it one of those
supplementary guys?

28:04.720 --> 28:07.879
A triangle can't be
complimentary or supplementary.

28:07.880 --> 28:11.190
Only the angles that comprise
it can be judged that way.

28:11.440 --> 28:15.262
Right. Good. Good, exactly.

28:16.200 --> 28:20.999
The triangle that you drew,
albeit poorly, is isosceles,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.759
meaning that at least two of
its sides are equal in length.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.799
Right.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.119
So, for example,

28:28.120 --> 28:34.309
what angle is complimentary
to a 45-degree angle?

28:34.400 --> 28:36.639
Well, if they're gonna add up to 90,

28:36.640 --> 28:38.319
it would be a 45-degree angle.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.439
- Correct.
- Yes!

28:39.440 --> 28:41.863
Good. Now for a
supplementary angle...

28:43.320 --> 28:45.599
- Hey! Hey!
- Tucker!

28:45.600 --> 28:48.159
What are you doing, man?
We're in the middle of a lesson.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.879
I lied about having to choom, Dad.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.479
I just wanted to kill the triangle.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.039
No! Well, turn it off.
We are in the middle of school.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.319
This isn't fun time.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.519
I was pretending
the triangle was Arab.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.639
What? Oh, my God. Who told you that?

29:01.640 --> 29:03.159
Not all Arabs are bad.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.159
Levi Goldfarb said all
Arabs want to kill Jews.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.799
Well, Levi Goldfarb is wrong.
That's not true at all.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.319
Well, how do we know
which ones are bad?

29:10.320 --> 29:12.519
It's complicated,

29:12.520 --> 29:15.639
and I didn't know we were
gonna get there on day one,

29:15.640 --> 29:18.359
but, um, for starters
there's al-Qaeda.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.679
The black weatherman?

29:19.680 --> 29:21.341
No, that's Al Roker.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.479
Al Roker wants to kill Jews?

29:23.480 --> 29:25.599
No, buddy, he's very good
friends with Matt Lauer.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.879
I'm pretty sure he's Jewish.
We'll Google it.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.319
Grace is the teacher?

29:29.320 --> 29:31.199
Yes, Grace is the
teacher for the minute.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.359
Grace is so boring!

29:32.360 --> 29:34.079
- Don't say that.
- No, I'm not!

29:34.080 --> 29:35.319
I want to be the teacher!

29:35.320 --> 29:37.239
Okay, you can be.
What do you want to teach us?

29:37.240 --> 29:38.999
- How to be an idiot.
- Don't say that.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.719
I am not an idiot!
And you're in love with Jesse.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.319
- No, she's not.
- No, I'm not!

29:42.320 --> 29:44.199
Then why did you write his
name all over your notebook?

29:44.200 --> 29:45.439
You wrote his name all
over your notebook?

29:45.440 --> 29:46.519
- What is wrong with you?
- Yeah, you know what?

29:46.520 --> 29:48.359
- That is my notebook!
- You should not look in her notebook.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.719
Jesse's gonna put his penis on you!

29:49.720 --> 29:51.839
- Stop fucking cursing!
- Swear jar!

29:53.760 --> 29:56.679
We all ride a
merry-go-round of feelings.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.199
Going round and round,

29:58.200 --> 30:00.239
up and down,
from one emotion to another.

30:00.240 --> 30:03.119
And I bet if you think
back over your day,

30:03.120 --> 30:05.145
you'll realize that you've been sad,

30:05.240 --> 30:08.584
confused, happy or excited
at least once already.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.119
I know I have.

30:11.120 --> 30:15.909
But one of the best things about
feelings is sharing them.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.584
See you next time.

30:26.760 --> 30:27.799
What's going on?

30:27.800 --> 30:29.999
I know it looks weird,
but they're having a lesson.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.585
Aidan, why are the children
duct-taped to chairs?

30:34.800 --> 30:35.879
They wouldn't listen to me.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.359
I couldn't get control
of them, Sarah.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.519
They asked about al-Qaeda. I have to
work on this audition for tomorrow,

30:40.520 --> 30:43.879
and LeVar Burton seems to be the
only thing that calms them down.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.319
Fortunately for us, I have Roots.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.279
Okay, this is not gonna work.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.679
You can't just show the kids videos,

30:50.680 --> 30:52.999
and you certainly can't
force them into learning.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.119
Well, then what's your idea?

30:54.120 --> 30:56.359
Because they're fighting
every single thing I try.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.227
We need to regroup.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.759
Why don't we go to dinner?

31:01.760 --> 31:03.830
Who's gonna babysit?

31:05.440 --> 31:07.519
Lego Death Star is worth
three hours of babysitting,

31:07.520 --> 31:10.279
if, and only if, it's in the box,
and said box is in mint condition.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.544
It is. It's brand-new.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.300
Can I keep them taped up like that?

31:18.680 --> 31:20.864
No. No.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.304
I'll free them.
You've got three hours.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.346
What's the happiest
you've ever seen me?

31:40.160 --> 31:42.105
Surfing.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.919
What? That was like 100 years ago.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.390
It's the first thing
that came to my mind.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.519
I remember I was lying on
the beach reading a book,

31:52.520 --> 31:54.319
and you were taking those lessons.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.159
And I was watching you

31:57.160 --> 31:59.319
and you kept trying to get up,

31:59.320 --> 32:02.346
trying to get up,
and then you finally got up.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.230
And I couldn't see your face
'cause you were kinda far out.

32:06.520 --> 32:10.229
I could just feel it, this elation,

32:11.000 --> 32:14.959
this pure joy.

32:14.960 --> 32:18.862
The happiest you've ever seen
me is a smile you never saw?

32:18.960 --> 32:21.349
I guess, yeah. Is that weird?

32:22.160 --> 32:25.959
I suppose it's beautiful
in a bizarre kind of way.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.261
What's the happiest
you've ever seen me?

32:34.840 --> 32:37.999
You were doing a Shakespeare
thing outside at Northwestern.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.199
Romeo and Juliet.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.781
Yeah.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.359
And no one was there.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.999
I mean, no one was there.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.399
There were a few people that
were there, but I get the point.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.559
It wasn't even a real show.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.519
You were just, like,
in the middle of a soccer field.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.879
It was a traveling production.

32:55.880 --> 32:59.079
And it was really fucking
thrilling to watch.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.948
'Cause you loved words.
You loved poetry.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.383
But I do remember it
kinda made me feel sad.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.506
Why?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.119
Honey, I want to support you.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.999
I really do believe in you.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.559
Why did seeing me love
Shakespeare make you sad?

33:20.560 --> 33:22.199
I don't know.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.839
I was terrified that
I'd never ever find

33:24.840 --> 33:26.439
that kind of passion in my life.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.271
And the truth is, I haven't.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.799
I input data into a spreadsheet.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.999
Literally, a scanner
should be doing my job,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.879
and there's just too much bureaucracy
for anyone to even notice.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.399
One day you're gonna be running
that whole fucking place.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.599
I don't want to run the
fucking water department.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.959
Then what do you want to do?
I don't even know.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.279
I don't know. And you know what?

33:47.280 --> 33:49.359
I don't have a second
to figure it out,

33:49.360 --> 33:51.319
because I'm on a fucking treadmill.

33:51.320 --> 33:55.279
And if I stop, our kids don't eat.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.748
And it's all on me.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.639
I just...

34:01.640 --> 34:03.599
I thought you supported my dream.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.670
You said you supported my dream.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.959
When did this relationship become

34:07.960 --> 34:11.304
solely about supporting your dream?

34:21.639 --> 34:23.426
Hello?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.186
Yes?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.745
Oh, my God.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.266
Dr. Becker, what happened?

34:42.400 --> 34:44.359
I told him the new-age
treatment was nonsense,

34:44.360 --> 34:46.799
but desperate people
will try anything.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.918
It didn't work?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.039
The cancer's progressed.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.518
He's having paraneoplastic symptoms,

34:52.520 --> 34:54.119
his liver's beginning to fail.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.478
Can we see him?

34:55.480 --> 34:59.905
Well, he's sleeping, but he's
right in here in ICU. Come.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.359
Okay, okay, let's just calm down.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.439
What are you talking about, Noah?
Why would we not be calm?

35:36.440 --> 35:37.999
Look, before you freak out,

35:38.000 --> 35:39.399
I still get the Death Star.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.061
What's happening, Noah?

35:41.200 --> 35:42.919
This.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.946
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck!

35:46.120 --> 35:49.599
I am tired of you guys
not listening to me.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.719
I just want to go back to
yeshiva and be with my friends,

35:52.720 --> 35:54.399
and I am sick and tired of Tucker

35:54.400 --> 35:56.550
always teasing me about Jesse.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.879
Now everyone will know who I am.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.519
So you shaved your head?

36:01.520 --> 36:03.039
Sweetie, your beautiful hair.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.559
Your beautiful hair.

36:04.560 --> 36:09.239
You said that I would still be
pretty even if I shaved my head!

36:09.240 --> 36:11.119
- What?
- No, completely out of context.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.239
What are you talking about?

36:12.240 --> 36:14.399
I was talking about the
Orthodox wig thing.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.879
This is not what I was talking about.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.679
I was just innocently playing
video games with the boy when...

36:18.680 --> 36:20.079
- Tucker!
- Tucker, great kid.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.279
Really a lot smarter
than I thought...

36:21.280 --> 36:22.799
- You let her shave her fucking head?
- No, no!

36:22.800 --> 36:24.399
You know, they were just
having their normal banter.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.759
I certainly didn't think that

36:25.760 --> 36:27.919
she was gonna come out looking
like fucking Sinead O'Connor.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.959
Okay, I shouldn't cry, right?

36:28.960 --> 36:30.559
- No, don't cry. It's just hair.
- 'Cause it's just hair.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.119
It'll grow back in, like, a year.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.199
- Go to your room!
- What's going on?

36:33.200 --> 36:34.759
- Don't go to your room.
- Go in the house!

36:34.760 --> 36:36.559
- I'll go to your room.
- Go in the house!

36:36.560 --> 36:39.159
- Go inside.
- Feel better. Feel better, kiddo.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.999
And you get the fuck out of here.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.599
What about our little Lego situation?

36:43.600 --> 36:47.279
My child shaved her head
while you were babysitting.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.759
You think you're getting
a Lego Death Star?

36:48.760 --> 36:50.119
You're out of your fucking mind.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.319
You're a fucking Indian giver.

36:51.320 --> 36:52.479
You're a piece of shit Indian giver.

36:52.480 --> 36:53.999
And by the way, do you know
where I just came from?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.519
Your father lying
comatose in the hospital

36:56.520 --> 36:59.999
with wires and veins and
the thing in his nose.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.679
I thought he was on some sort of...

37:01.680 --> 37:04.639
No, the treatment didn't work, man.
He's dying for real, okay?

37:04.640 --> 37:05.799
How long does he have?

37:05.800 --> 37:07.159
I don't know, but the fact
that you're asking that,

37:07.160 --> 37:08.519
what, are you gonna procrastinate?

37:08.520 --> 37:10.759
Cancer means dying, Noah,
and you need to wake up,

37:10.760 --> 37:13.831
because life is happening
all around you.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.319
Oh.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.719
Nice to see you, Mr. Bloom.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.959
Sorry it's under such
difficult circumstances.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.621
I have something for you.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.799
Sorry to throw all
of this at you now.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.349
It does have to be dealt with
sooner rather than later.

37:42.640 --> 37:47.225
He's very sick. Counsel the actor.

38:23.560 --> 38:28.987
Come over here.
Don't be fooled by all this.

38:29.800 --> 38:33.827
It's all to cover their
asses so nobody gets sued.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.500
I'm fine.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.479
So, Dad, I'm confused.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.599
You said there was this
experimental treatment.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.479
They told me from the beginning

38:53.480 --> 38:56.267
it doesn't work for everyone.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.919
I rolled the dice.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.759
But did Dr. Becker give
you any new information?

39:01.760 --> 39:03.359
Did he say anything about...

39:03.360 --> 39:06.545
A few months. Maybe a year.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.144
Or as long as it takes
them to finish the 405.

39:13.120 --> 39:16.351
If I died every time he
said I was gonna die,

39:16.760 --> 39:20.742
I'd have more lives than
Shirley MacLaine. Jesus.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.670
Did you see that pitch?

39:25.960 --> 39:29.589
If Collins doesn't pull a new
pitcher out of the bullpen soon,

39:30.200 --> 39:32.782
I'm gonna yank all these tubes
and jump out the window.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.902
Hey, is there any water over there?

39:39.320 --> 39:41.424
Yeah.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.383
You okay?

40:42.200 --> 40:43.861
Yeah.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.710
I mean, I guess, no.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.759
It's funny, you spend your whole life

40:50.760 --> 40:52.159
hoping it'll all mean something,

40:52.160 --> 40:54.839
and ultimately it
really comes down to

40:54.840 --> 40:57.719
one question in a
neatly folded pamphlet.

40:57.720 --> 41:01.159
How should we deal with your bones?

41:01.160 --> 41:04.550
Honey, maybe you shouldn't
be looking at that right now.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.186
How are the kids?

41:10.440 --> 41:12.319
Scared.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.821
Yeah.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.039
I just always imagined

41:15.040 --> 41:19.386
I'd have a better handle on what
I believed by the time we had kids.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.319
And we got pregnant so young,

41:21.320 --> 41:23.319
and now I have these
little faces looking up

41:23.320 --> 41:25.279
at me and I don't know what to say.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.319
I know, I'm with you. Fuck if I know

41:27.320 --> 41:29.231
what we're supposed to be doing here.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.949
As parents or on Earth?

41:35.080 --> 41:36.239
Can I say both?

41:44.400 --> 41:48.746
Gracie, wake up, sleepyhead.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.879
What's going on?

41:52.880 --> 41:55.621
We're going on a field trip.

41:55.840 --> 41:59.423
I made you a bowl
of cereal, but I ate it.

43:44.080 --> 43:47.186
Is Grandpa gonna die?

43:49.000 --> 43:51.239
It looks that way, sweetie.

43:51.240 --> 43:55.062
Are we gonna bury him in
the backyard with Whiskers?

43:55.600 --> 43:58.399
Oh, buddy, I don't think
we're allowed to do that.

43:58.400 --> 44:02.159
We're gonna have to ask
Grandpa what he wants.

44:02.160 --> 44:06.904
I think he'll want
to be with Whiskers.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.582
All right, guys, here we are.

44:31.320 --> 44:34.999
Follow me.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.239
Shouldn't we set up our camp?

44:36.240 --> 44:37.719
We'll do it later. This way.

44:37.720 --> 44:38.799
What are we doing out here?

44:38.800 --> 44:41.479
I'm showing you one of the
coolest places on Earth.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.079
I'll race you to the top.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.919
Wow! Look at those legs!

44:45.920 --> 44:50.199
Lookit, the little legs are fastest!

44:50.200 --> 44:54.102
This is it. This is the spot.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.119
What is it?

44:56.120 --> 44:57.959
This is the spot where I
had one of the deepest,

44:57.960 --> 45:01.111
most sincere, spiritual
moments of my life.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.701
The last time I had an epiphany,
it was right here.

45:04.800 --> 45:06.426
What's an "aniffany"?

45:06.800 --> 45:10.639
An epiphany is when
you realize something

45:10.640 --> 45:13.319
that you really needed to realize.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.959
You know, sometimes in life
you can get kinda stuck

45:16.960 --> 45:19.359
and you feel like you should
have changed chapters by now,

45:19.360 --> 45:22.147
but you can't.

45:22.520 --> 45:26.559
Are you stuck because
Grandpa's dying?

45:26.560 --> 45:29.559
Am I stuck because Grandpa's dying?

45:29.560 --> 45:30.759
Uh, yeah.

45:30.760 --> 45:33.119
I think that's one of the reasons.

45:33.120 --> 45:36.305
And because you haven't worked
since that dandruff commercial?

45:36.560 --> 45:38.903
That's in there, too.
Thanks for reminding me.

45:41.600 --> 45:42.839
Well, the sun went down.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.119
What do you guys say,
should we make a fire?

45:44.120 --> 45:45.159
Yeah.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.821
All right, let's do it.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.229
Help him out, Grace, help him out.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.988
Will Grandpa be able to
see us when he dies?

46:01.440 --> 46:04.279
I don't know, buddy. I don't know.

46:04.280 --> 46:07.181
Nobody knows what
happens when you die.

46:07.440 --> 46:11.706
There's as many opinions
as there are people.

46:12.520 --> 46:16.502
And some people will tell you with
absolute certainty they know.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.545
But they're wrong?

46:19.520 --> 46:23.479
No. No, I'm not saying they're wrong.

46:23.480 --> 46:26.062
Right now I kinda
feel like they're lucky.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.183
'Cause the rest of us, until we

46:29.520 --> 46:32.119
see something that makes sense,

46:32.120 --> 46:36.159
until we hear something we believe,

46:36.160 --> 46:39.550
we're kinda left with nothing.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.359
Tell us a ghost story.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.399
I don't know any
ghost stories. Do you?

46:43.400 --> 46:44.559
I'll think about it.

46:44.560 --> 46:45.599
All right, you think on it.

46:45.600 --> 46:47.119
I can think of one, too.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.519
I know they usually end
with someone has a claw.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.759
I could tell you something Grandma

46:52.760 --> 46:54.039
used to say to me when I went to bed.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.079
How about that?

46:55.080 --> 46:56.199
- Okay.
- All right.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.065
I remember a little bit.

46:59.440 --> 47:03.239
"And indeed there will be time

47:03.240 --> 47:06.903
"For the yellow smoke that
slides along the street

47:06.920 --> 47:10.839
"Rubbing its back
upon the window panes

47:10.840 --> 47:12.580
"There will be time

47:14.040 --> 47:15.239
"There will be time

47:15.240 --> 47:19.301
"To prepare a face to meet
the faces that you meet

47:19.800 --> 47:22.428
"There will be time
to murder and create

47:25.920 --> 47:28.679
"And time for all the
works and days of hands

47:28.680 --> 47:33.629
"That lift and drop a
question on your plate

47:34.800 --> 47:39.385
"Time for you and time for me

47:41.120 --> 47:43.588
"And time yet for 100 indecisions

47:44.840 --> 47:47.999
"And for 100 visions and revisions

47:48.000 --> 47:53.791
"Before the taking
of a toast and tea"

48:03.680 --> 48:05.279
Wake up, sleepyheads.

48:05.280 --> 48:07.270
It's time for school.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.944
Did you have an epiphany?

48:14.480 --> 48:19.542
No. But I did have
a really good idea.

48:24.960 --> 48:28.599
You can pick any one you want.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.590
- Any one?
- Any one.

48:31.040 --> 48:35.670
Just as long as it is unique
and amazing like you.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.945
Oh, hey, pal. Come on in.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.581
Oh!

49:08.840 --> 49:12.389
Just watching this kitten video
on YouTube. This kitten is crazy.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.799
Sorry, can I talk to
you about something?

49:14.800 --> 49:18.907
Sure. Come on in. Have a seat.
What's on your mind?

49:19.960 --> 49:21.959
It's just that I'm
having some trouble

49:21.960 --> 49:25.039
getting used to my cubicle partner.

49:25.040 --> 49:28.544
- Jerry? But he's hilarious.
- Yeah.

49:29.600 --> 49:35.425
It's just that he's a
little inappropriate and...

49:36.480 --> 49:37.959
I know I'm relatively new here.

49:37.960 --> 49:41.639
So I don't want to ruffle
anyone's status quo.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.439
But I think it's time I let you know

49:43.440 --> 49:46.039
that he's making me uncomfortable.

49:46.040 --> 49:47.999
Okay, so what did he say?

49:48.000 --> 49:52.119
Well, he started with saying that

49:52.120 --> 49:54.270
when he's not wearing any underwear,

49:55.440 --> 50:00.119
that he gets these
little half-boners.

50:00.120 --> 50:01.621
Mmm-hmm.

50:02.240 --> 50:04.159
He also made it talk to me.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.359
Who?

50:05.360 --> 50:07.199
His half-boner.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.799
Well, what did it sound like?

50:08.800 --> 50:14.279
I don't know.
It's like a high-pitched...

50:14.280 --> 50:17.919
Like a ghost voice.

50:17.920 --> 50:22.319
Okay, but he didn't do a black
guy voice or anything, did he?

50:22.320 --> 50:24.026
He didn't do anything racial?

50:24.280 --> 50:25.959
No, it was high-pitched.

50:25.960 --> 50:28.559
- Good.
- Like a mouse.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.599
Or, like I said, a ghost.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.279
Like a ghost mouse.

50:32.280 --> 50:33.799
Sure.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.799
Okay, okay. Look, Sarah,

50:35.800 --> 50:37.279
I know we don't always run things

50:37.280 --> 50:38.599
according to the book around here,

50:38.600 --> 50:41.519
but I think you need
to lighten up a little bit.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.199
Nobody's trying to touch you.

50:43.200 --> 50:46.079
No one's making their
penis talk like a rapper.

50:46.080 --> 50:50.079
So, I'll tell you what. I am going
to move Jerry out of your cubicle

50:50.080 --> 50:51.639
and I'm also gonna tell him
to tone it down a notch.

50:51.640 --> 50:55.639
But you need to promise
to smile a little more.

50:55.640 --> 50:58.347
You know, a little bit
more Hakuna matata.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.639
I don't know what that means.

51:00.640 --> 51:03.319
It means, "No worries for
the rest of your days."

51:03.320 --> 51:05.399
No, I have two children,
I know it's from The Lion King.

51:05.400 --> 51:08.639
I just don't understand how that
applies to the water department.

51:08.640 --> 51:12.079
It means that you need to
lighten up a little bit, Sarah.

51:12.080 --> 51:14.662
You've got something
everybody else wants.

51:16.480 --> 51:17.999
Remind me what that is.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.025
A job.

51:21.880 --> 51:24.906
Right.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.839
Well, I guess technically this
could qualify as art class.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.159
Hey, bud, make sure you're cutting

51:33.160 --> 51:34.799
along the lines here
that I drew, okay?

51:34.800 --> 51:37.399
That's for the chest piece.
It's very special.

51:37.400 --> 51:39.199
Aren't you a little old
for playing dress-up?

51:39.200 --> 51:40.759
It's hardly playing dress-up, Aidan.

51:40.760 --> 51:43.119
It's for Comic-Con.
The top prize is $1,000.

51:43.120 --> 51:45.679
Not to mention the chance for
some congratulatory poontang

51:45.680 --> 51:47.479
from a super-hot Furry I just met.

51:47.480 --> 51:48.519
What's poontang?

51:48.520 --> 51:49.679
It's what the astronauts drink.

51:49.680 --> 51:51.559
- Can I have some poontang?
- One day.

51:51.560 --> 51:52.879
It's only available in space.

51:52.880 --> 51:54.506
Damn it.

51:56.480 --> 51:58.879
So, hey, we're gonna meet
up at my house around 6:30

51:58.880 --> 52:00.199
and then we'll go see Dad, okay?

52:00.200 --> 52:03.199
Oh, yeah, right. I've been meaning
to talk to you about that, Aidan.

52:03.200 --> 52:06.039
You know, I got a ton of work
here and plus, I'm not going.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.279
What?

52:07.280 --> 52:10.319
Dude, what's the point?
I haven't seen him for, like, a year.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.879
I guess my tolerance for being called

52:11.880 --> 52:13.399
a disappointment has
an expiration date.

52:13.400 --> 52:15.839
You haven't spoken to Dad in a year?

52:15.840 --> 52:18.159
No. The last time he called
me was on my birthday.

52:18.160 --> 52:21.719
I think my present was a
20-minute thesis on why I suck.

52:21.720 --> 52:24.109
So you're just gonna cut him off.

52:24.440 --> 52:26.879
Dude, you gotta see this
from my perspective, okay?

52:26.880 --> 52:30.159
You at least have
a wife and a family.

52:30.160 --> 52:33.119
When he looks at me,
all he sees is failure.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.679
Well, what about Grandma?

52:34.680 --> 52:39.239
No. My mom believed in me.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.839
With her, things were different.

52:40.840 --> 52:42.799
She at least made
him a tad bit nicer.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.879
But with my dad...

52:44.880 --> 52:47.826
Nope, never gave him any
reason to be proud of me.

52:48.280 --> 52:50.225
All right, let's try it on.

52:56.560 --> 52:59.199
Well, what do you think?

52:59.200 --> 53:00.861
- So cool.
- Awesome!

53:01.560 --> 53:03.266
Aidan?

53:07.800 --> 53:11.429
We both spent our entire lives
wishing we could be something great.

53:11.440 --> 53:13.599
And now we're finally
called upon to do something

53:13.600 --> 53:17.229
that requires some actual
bravery and you run and hide.

53:18.360 --> 53:23.719
You know what the problem with
hiding in a fish bowl is, Noah?

53:23.720 --> 53:25.631
Everyone can see you.

53:26.920 --> 53:29.900
Come on, guys. Let's go see Grandpa.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.823
Grace, come on.

53:33.920 --> 53:37.279
Bye, Uncle Noah. I love you.

53:37.280 --> 53:41.421
All right. Thanks. Thank you.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.399
I'm lost in balloons.
Right in here. Right in...

54:01.400 --> 54:04.519
Look who it is, Grandpa!

54:04.520 --> 54:06.039
Give Grandpa a hug.

54:06.040 --> 54:09.319
Hey. Thank you.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.679
Got you some balloons.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.639
Mommy will put those in the corner.

54:12.640 --> 54:14.187
I'll take those.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.221
What's wrong, Dad?

54:19.280 --> 54:20.879
What'd these hippies do to your hair?

54:20.880 --> 54:23.719
Oh, it's just temporary dye, Dad.
She was just having a little fun.

54:23.720 --> 54:24.839
- Right, Gracie?
- Yeah.

54:24.840 --> 54:27.866
Looks like you work in the
world's oldest profession.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.199
What's the world's oldest profession?

54:30.200 --> 54:33.399
Being an angel was the
very first job there was.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.106
Beautiful angel.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.439
I am your angel, Grandpa.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.879
I daven a healing prayer
for you three times a day.

54:39.880 --> 54:42.030
- Once in the morning, once...
- Grandpa!

54:42.320 --> 54:43.839
I bought you a fart buzzer.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.199
What's a fart buzzer?

54:45.200 --> 54:46.519
It's this thing.

54:46.520 --> 54:47.839
You press different buttons

54:47.840 --> 54:50.079
and it makes different
funny fart noises.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.959
You may choose any
fart you would like.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.799
I choose for you the Ripper.

55:02.880 --> 55:05.542
Oh, I see the
homeschooling's going well.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.319
Tucker, do you know
your times tables yet?

55:09.320 --> 55:11.639
No. But I know this.

55:13.080 --> 55:15.519
I don't know if Grandpa's a
big fan of the fart buzzer.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.279
- I'm gonna take the fart buzzer.
- Put that away.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.759
You gotta learn those times tables.

55:18.760 --> 55:21.199
Oh, he's just working
on addition, Dad.

55:21.200 --> 55:23.119
Yeah. He's six.

55:23.120 --> 55:24.399
I know my times tables.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.359
Yeah, there you go. We got
someone who knows them there.

55:26.360 --> 55:30.581
Good. Study hard.
Don't become an actor.

55:31.400 --> 55:32.879
Well, maybe I'll take
the kids outside.

55:32.880 --> 55:34.359
No, sweetie. Don't, no, no,
no one's going anywhere.

55:34.360 --> 55:37.039
Yeah, I think maybe
it's time to take them.

55:37.040 --> 55:39.919
It's fine when you're
playing around in college.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.264
But sooner or later you have
to provide for your family.

55:43.360 --> 55:45.669
You're gonna need those times tables.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.999
Well, maybe Tucker will have a wife

55:48.000 --> 55:50.279
who loves him and supports him.

55:50.280 --> 55:52.919
And will remind him of the answer
if he occasionally forgets.

55:52.920 --> 55:56.390
Maybe he'll marry someone
that enables his fantasies.

55:56.640 --> 55:59.999
Lets him sit around waiting
for a dream to come true

56:00.000 --> 56:03.788
while his children sit dumbfounded
by the edge of a muddy pool.

56:04.400 --> 56:08.302
Grace can't even swim,
for God's sakes.

56:10.760 --> 56:14.679
Um, grandpa,
I found something for you.

56:14.680 --> 56:16.079
Something that you're gonna need.

56:16.080 --> 56:19.470
What, my angel, my hope?

56:21.880 --> 56:24.759
What the hell am I gonna
do with welder's goggles?

56:24.760 --> 56:27.547
Well, here, put them on.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.999
You look good.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.959
Now, when you head into the white
light, you won't have to squint.

56:36.960 --> 56:41.146
So you can find Grandma.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.359
Guys, that was fantastic.

58:01.360 --> 58:02.861
Why don't you take a break?

58:03.920 --> 58:06.399
Terrific job.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.239
It was beautiful, you guys.

58:08.240 --> 58:10.469
- Really nice.
- Thanks.

58:11.320 --> 58:12.919
I'm not here to convert.

58:12.920 --> 58:15.263
Good, 'cause I've
already met my quota.

58:16.320 --> 58:18.185
Have a seat.

58:20.440 --> 58:24.399
You know, I was kosher
until I was 13.

58:24.400 --> 58:25.679
Really?

58:25.680 --> 58:26.919
Yeah.

58:26.920 --> 58:31.948
Yeah. My father told me that I was
officially a man at my Bar Mitzvah.

58:32.040 --> 58:34.439
So I told him that, as a man,

58:34.440 --> 58:37.079
I wanted to have a bacon
double cheeseburger.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.628
I think I saw his head explode.

58:41.800 --> 58:44.159
But to his credit, he let me eat

58:44.160 --> 58:47.311
whatever I wanted outside the house.

58:47.920 --> 58:50.991
I think I impressed
him with my logic.

58:53.640 --> 58:56.302
What brings you to temple, Aidan?

58:57.240 --> 58:58.959
When we were kids, my brother and I

58:58.960 --> 59:00.639
used to pretend we were these

59:00.640 --> 59:03.620
superhero space-men.

59:04.800 --> 59:07.039
We'd go out to the
woods behind our house

59:07.040 --> 59:10.279
and pretend it was
this mystical planet

59:10.280 --> 59:13.590
and we were the only ones
who could save everybody.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.706
But I've been thinking
about that a lot lately.

59:19.240 --> 59:23.839
Remembering those fantasies
for the first time in, like,

59:23.840 --> 59:25.479
14 years.

59:25.480 --> 59:27.186
What do you think it means?

59:27.520 --> 59:30.479
I don't know. And I'm even
embarrassed to say this out loud,

59:30.480 --> 59:33.506
but if I can't say it to you,
I can't say it to anybody.

59:34.840 --> 59:36.910
Do you think

59:37.560 --> 59:42.065
God is trying to tell me something?

59:43.200 --> 59:45.679
Trying to guide me in some way?

59:45.680 --> 59:50.185
And if you say He works in mysterious
ways, I will run out that door.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.869
Do you feel any spiritual
connection at all to anything?

59:56.000 --> 59:57.865
Infinity.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.279
Looking up at the sky with my kids

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.879
and trying to explain to them
that it goes on forever.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.509
I do feel a spirituality in that.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.959
Could that be God?

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.861
God can be whatever
you want him to be.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.039
You're getting tangled in semantics.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.919
Try not to get caught up in the
God who wants you to be kosher,

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.741
and the God who wants
you to study the Torah.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.719
Start with God as
the infinite universe,

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.279
and imagine that that force may be

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.399
trying desperately to guide you

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.905
through the most challenging
part of your life.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.750
Even if it has to appear to you
in the form of a space-man

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.630
to get you to listen.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.519
Why does Grandpa have baby jellyfish?

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.319
Those aren't jellyfish, buddy.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.879
Believe it or not,
those are contact lenses.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.999
Your grandpa saved all the
contact lenses he ever wore.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.119
Why?

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.439
He said he just couldn't
bear to throw them out

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.942
'cause it's everything he ever saw.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.999
It's weird, right?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.559
I know, but it's kinda
good-weird. I like it.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.679
Well, he must have
seen a lot of stuff.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.799
He did. If you think about it,
all those years,

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.079
all the things that he saw with
his eyes through those lenses.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.439
Also, before he retired,
he was a microbiology professor.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.759
What's that?

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.199
That's someone who studies things

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.359
you can only see with a microscope.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.103
So, really, really,
really tiny things. Hey!

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.879
I know the albums are fascinating,

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.359
but I could use a little help
getting this place set up

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.340
so it's nice and cozy for
when Grandpa comes home.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.380
So, if Grandpa's dying,
then why is he coming home?

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.919
Because we don't want Grandpa
to be alone in a scary hospital.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.959
We want him to come home and
be with his family, be with us.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.101
So we're making him all cozy so
he's happy when he meets God?

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.981
Yeah.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.319
Whoa! When did Grandpa
have this cool car?

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.879
Look at that thing.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.669
That, my friends, is a '62 Cadillac.
Look at those fins.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.468
Look how happy he was, huh?

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.239
Why, this was taken at a dealership.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.151
He could never afford that car.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.599
That sucks.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.226
It does suck.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.511
It's cool.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.679
Hello. Welcome to Aston Martin.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.679
Hello. Um, my name is Marco

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.310
and I work for Sean "Puff
Daddy" "Dirty Money" Combs.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.599
Um, these are Puffy's children,

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.199
and he's asked me to
come in and test drive

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.590
the new Aston Martin DB9 Volante.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.839
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.119
Of course.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.319
Please, come right here.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.901
Be good, children.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.879
I know what you're thinking.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.428
"Why are Puffy's kids white?"

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.439
Valid question.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.519
Well, so many celebrities were
going and adopting black children.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.919
- You know what he went and did?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.549
He went to Switzerland and adopted
these two skim-milk popsicles.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.359
Tucker! Do not.
Tucker, it's not funny.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.799
I know what you're trying to do.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.879
You do?

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.479
Do you know how many
people walk in here

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.719
and try to sweet-talk their way into

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.559
test-driving one of these bad boys?

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.904
- So annoying.
- Hey! I never fall for it.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.469
But I can see your daughter's sick.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.719
So, you know what?
I'm gonna make an exception.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.199
And you don't even
look good in the wig.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.559
So take it off, like, seriously.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.039
- No way.
- It's my wig.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.110
She is sick, isn't she?

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.199
Have some respect.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.031
- So sick.
- Mmm...

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.919
Okay, attendance.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.239
- Grace.
- Here!

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.504
- Tucker.
- Here.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.759
- What's your name?
- Anthony.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.119
Anthony's here, too, Dad.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.359
All right, Anthony.
Welcome to our classroom.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.519
Now, kids, unless
you're on the Autobahn,

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.079
you're never gonna get a
car like this up to speed.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.879
So in a city like LA,

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.559
it's really about what it sounds like

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.239
when you floor it from a full stop.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.559
Yes, but, kids, we're on
Robertson Boulevard.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.199
So there will be no flooring it

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.119
from a full stop, will there be?

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.588
- No, sir.
- Thank you.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.471
Did I scare you?

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.759
I thought if I ever
saw you here alone,

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.183
you'd be putting a
pillow over my face.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.999
I looked.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.919
You're lying on the
only two in the room.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.759
I've been watching the paramedics

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.239
come and go for the last half-hour.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.639
And every few minutes
they race in at full speed

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.639
doing everything they can
to save someone's life

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.359
and then a few minutes later,

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.511
they all walk outside
and smoke cigarettes.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.799
You never really think about
death until you're here.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.119
Chemicals pumping into your veins
while you watch Maury Povich.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.941
I'm unclear which one
is killing me faster.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.599
Can I offer you some saline?

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.439
I'm glad to see you're
keeping your sense of humor.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.544
What else am I supposed to do?

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.719
Eventually things get tragic enough

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.904
and they circle back to comedy.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.703
Yeah.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.385
You know, I don't think
I ever told you this,

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:16.030
but when I lost my sister, you were
the most helpful person to me.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.144
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.183
I mean, I'm glad if I was, but I
don't even remember what I said.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.391
You said,

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.399
"Nothing in life will call upon
us to be more courageous

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.359
"than facing the fact that it ends.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.989
"But on the other side of
heartbreak is wisdom."

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.439
I said that?

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.101
Yeah.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.751
That was good advice.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:49.346
And now here I am,
a shiva waiting to happen.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.104
Well, the wisdom that came out for me

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.421
was that the things left
unsaid stay with us forever.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.279
I wish nothing more

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.386
than if I could tell my
sister how much I loved her

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.507
and that I always idolized her.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.359
But we never said those things.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.067
We just weren't like that.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.589
And suddenly one day she's gone.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.519
And I have all these things to say,

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.306
but no one to say them to.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.319
Both my boys know how I feel.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.504
Are you sure, Gabe?

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.145
I told them I wanted to retire.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.151
I lied.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.624
They pushed me out.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.584
'Cause I wasn't keeping
up with technology.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.421
Don't let anyone push them out.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.999
Have you told them this?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.025
What is this?

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.862
Is this an intervention?

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.479
Did you come here to tell
me how I failed as a father?

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:22.140
No!

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.627
Not at all. You've raised
two incredible boys, Gabe.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.078
They may not have quick answers

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.947
or awards on their mantles.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.384
In fact, neither one
of them has a mantle.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.264
But they're incredible,

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.466
with big, sensitive hearts.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.439
And right now they need to know

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:51.863
how much their father loves them.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.747
Barbara used to help you with
the hard part of parenting, right?

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.707
She made everyone around her happy.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.982
She just brought out the best in me.

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:21.759
I think if she were here right
now she'd tell you that

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:25.548
your boys will remember this
time for the rest of their lives.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.020
It will shape who they are as men.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.151
You're gonna make a great
matriarch one day.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.945
I already am a great matriarch, Gabe.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.468
At least I'm working on it.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.799
Today, we are going to Mr. Miyagi
the shit out of this fence.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.159
Who's Mr. Miyagi?

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.639
Mr. Miyagi is an older Asian man

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.824
that taught me many life lessons.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.079
The point is I'm sick of
looking at this fence.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.599
Today we're gonna fix it.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.959
Tucker, where's your drill?

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.303
- It's under my pillow.
- Please go get it.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:36.301
- Whoo-hoo!
- Okay, Grace, come up here.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.039
Hop on the diving board.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.666
Okay.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.199
You are going to recite this poem

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.384
while Tucker and I work on the fence.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.399
Then we'll switch.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.839
This is weird.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.186
Think of it as a prayer you're
not expecting anyone to answer.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.879
All right, Tuck, good.
Come over here. Put the drill down.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.999
We're gonna use it later
when we put 'em back up.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.519
Come over here with this crowbar.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.119
And the point is to jam it in
here and then use your leverage.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.719
Slide your arms down. Yeah!

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.599
Oh! You're a natural at this.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.229
Next up, we're gonna
re-plaster that pool.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.479
"Something there is that
doesn't love a wall

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.039
"That sends the
frozen-ground-swell under it

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.384
"And spills the upper
boulders in the sun

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.559
"I let my neighbor
know beyond the hill

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.159
"And on a day we
meet to walk the line

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.391
"And set the wall
between us once again

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.319
"Before I built a
wall I'd ask to know

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.743
"What I was walling in or walling out

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.707
"And to whom I was
like to give offense

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.343
"Something there is
that doesn't love a wall

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.269
"That wants it down"

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.781
Hey.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.380
- That's a load of colors.
- Uh-huh.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.941
What's going on back there?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.349
I'm comforting you.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.711
You've been going
through a lot lately.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.064
Thank you, baby.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.505
I really need to be
comforted right now.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:40.146
Good night all the moonlight ladies

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.865
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.386
Deep greens and blues
are the colors I choose

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.784
Won't you let me go
down in my dreams?

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:03.581
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.519
Where are the kids?

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.959
They're plastering the pool.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.064
Aidan!

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.959
I'm on a break.
They don't deserve a break.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.303
They need to work harder.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.588
This is the little hand that took
so long to plaster anything.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.945
I missed you.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.719
What do you mean you missed me?
I've been right here.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.984
No, you haven't been.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.501
I haven't seen you in a while.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.461
But I'm glad you're here, Mr. Bloom.

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.559
I am Khaleesi, Queen of the Dragons.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.710
You are Khaleesi

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.559
and I am the brown guy who died.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.107
I can't remember my name,
but I think it might be Drago.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.750
This is awesome.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.744
I've never heard of post-sex
role-playing, but I like it.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.919
I have to tell you something,

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.502
and I don't want you to go crazy.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.266
What?

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.067
It's all under control,

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.584
but I just feel like it's
something you should be aware of.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.421
Sarah, what?

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.759
You know that guy Jerry

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.989
that I share my cubicle with at work?

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.501
Yeah?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.106
He's been acting kind
of inappropriate lately.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.959
Is he, like, trying to
touch you or something?

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.781
No, no, no, nothing like that.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.630
It's more like doing stuff like

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.029
making his penis talk.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.759
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:49.119
Honey, honey, calm down.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.719
Well, did you talk to
Human Resources?

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:55.430
I talked to my boss and he
told me to sing Hakuna Matata.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.346
Are you...

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.959
Where does he live?
I'll go fucking talk to him.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.279
I don't need my husband
to come to my rescue.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.439
I can handle this.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.279
I feel like I should, like,
I have to talk to him.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.399
I wanna fucking kill him.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.479
You can't.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.319
I can't believe you're just
telling me about this now.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.142
Honey. I told you I didn't
want you to go crazy.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.221
Hey, hey. Hi, George.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.759
Hey, Dad.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.999
Yes.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.346
Hey. Oh, your lips
are so chapped, Dad.

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.030
Here's some ice.
George is slacking on you.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.868
There you go. There you go.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.866
Much better. That feel good?

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.159
Remember when that ice cream truck

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.239
would come around
when you were little?

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.319
Yeah.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.903
You and Noah would hear
the music and light up.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.626
And the three of us would chase
after him till he stopped.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.704
Were there fireflies?

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.199
I can't remember.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.863
Dad, you know there's no
fireflies in Los Angeles.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.424
I wanna remember it with fireflies.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.119
What was that I always
used to get? I forgot.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.679
Your favorite was the toasted almond.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.999
- Toasted almond.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.119
I'll have one of those.

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.621
Okay.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.180
That's the last thing
I wanna taste, Aidan.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.230
Okay, you got a deal.
I'll bring it to you.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.026
Wouldn't it be great if your
brother could be there, too?

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.820
That would be great, Dad.
That would be really, really great.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.504
You promise me.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.399
Promise me you'll try
to make that happen.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.311
Yeah. I...

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.944
I need to see him.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:58.944
I wanna make amends.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.425
I promise.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.831
I promise you.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.311
Okay.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.467
Get some sleep.
Why don't you take a nap?

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.799
Let me lead the way, Captain.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.302
Let me lead the way, Captain.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.959
Let me... These Ractonians.
It's Ractonian.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.879
Let me lead the way, Captain.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.463
These Ractonians could
be hiding anywhere.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.479
I'm sorry to bother you,
have you seen this show?

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.982
No one's seen this show.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.519
It's an insult to sci-fi.

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.079
Captain Kirk's probably
turning over in his grave.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.559
Well, technically Captain
Kirk isn't even born

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.540
until 2233, but that's irrelevant.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.479
Sorry, I'm a bit of an aficionado

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:05.268
and this dog shit is the reason
the genre gets no respect.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.822
Let me lead the way, Captain.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.429
Can I give you one thought, though?

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.999
Sure.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.799
- I don't mean to be presumptuous at all.
- No. Yeah.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.065
But I just was listening to
you and I just thought...

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.999
You're the first one off the ship.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.239
You don't even have a name.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.519
Okay, now we don't
have the whole script,

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.679
but the guy has two
lines in the first act

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.184
and he's gonna be the
first one off the ship.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.239
He's gonna die.

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.519
Of course he's gonna die!

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.679
He's seconds away from getting
his whole head blown off

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.626
by a bunch of Ractonians, okay?

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.239
So, just factor that in.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.359
- Amp up the fear a little bit.
- Right.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.023
This is probably the single
scariest moment of

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.679
- Random Crew Member Number One's life.
- Absolutely.

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.239
So, there's nothing
cavalier about it.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.550
- No. Right. Right.
- He's focused and terrified.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.222
- Thank you.
- Sure, just...

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.759
Why are you helping me?

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.879
I have no idea.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.559
It makes no sense, but,
you know, whatever.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.919
Careful, it could be kindness.

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:10.039
Oh, God, I hope not. I'll get
eaten alive in this town.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.863
His outfit's amazing.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.348
That's his first costume?

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.781
Yeah.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.439
Replacing your own pool filter

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.999
is challenging, but a lot of fun.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.719
One thing's for certain.
You're gonna need some skilled helpers.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.599
That's really good, buddy.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.661
Yeah, get all that gross stuff off.
You're doing awesome.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.106
Hello?

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.383
Yeah, yeah, put him on.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.426
Dad? Are you okay?

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.991
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
I'm coming. I'm coming right now.

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.310
Was that Grandpa?

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.828
He wants me to bring
him a toasted almond.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.670
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.799
I'm so glad we're neighbors.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.399
Yeah?

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.919
I thought you might want to know

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.959
that your father might pass
away at any moment now.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.825
I think you should come home.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.746
What's wrong?

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.119
I've been talking to him a lot,
Noah, and he wants to apologize.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.539
He wants to make amends,
he wants to make things right.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.159
We've been over this, Aidan.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.628
Look, I've been thinking and...

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.703
Maybe you don't realize this
until you have kids of your own,

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.559
but being a father is really hard.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:45.039
Look, uh, Aidan, I gotta go.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.199
Please, Noah.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.279
Let me talk to him.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.270
- Not now, sweetie.
- No.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.781
Uncle Noah?

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.879
Hi, it's Grace.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.223
Did Janine like the costume?

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.679
Did she give you some poontang?

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.319
Uh, yeah, she sure did.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.791
Uncle Noah, I've never asked
you for anything, have I?

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.039
No.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.068
I didn't get mad when you
forgot my birthday or Hanukkah

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.439
or that time you got drunk
and peed in my closet.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:16.799
Uh, well, Grace,
I got locked in there.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.559
Somebody locked me in there.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.062
I want you to come see Grandpa.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.865
Are you okay?

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.591
Grace, um, can I tell you a secret?

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.620
Yeah.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.103
I'm scared.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.906
Losing my mom was the hardest
thing I've ever been through.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.986
I don't know if I can take it again.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.308
I know that you're sad.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.264
But we're sad, too.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.307
And we should all be together.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.340
Listen.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.908
I know that you don't believe in God.

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.869
But maybe you can believe in family.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.664
Uncle Noah?

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.719
He hung up.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.506
What?

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.865
Maybe we got disconnected.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.827
But it kind of felt like he hung up.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.351
Here it is.

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.319
Dad, I think I see the guy who
sits next to Mommy at work.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.664
No. Did you ever hear
of the drink Kefir?

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.719
Sounds gross.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.382
It isn't. Well,
I'm gonna get a Kefir.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.399
Okay, hold this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.359
Dad, not now. Grandpa!

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.783
It's only gonna take a second.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.146
Are you into any of these products?

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.359
I don't drink dairy.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.719
You don't drink dairy?

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.519
How do you get all your protein?

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.559
Vegetables.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.079
Don't take veggies. You never
had cream in your coffee?

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.759
Depends on the cream.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.559
Don't you like your cake
with frosting on it?

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.679
I do.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.919
Wouldn't you like
a milky, like, sweet,

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.039
like, strawberry kind of,
you know, yogurt?

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.599
Excuse me, are you Jerry?

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.759
The guy with the talking dick?

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.879
Yeah. I told you.
Who the hell are you?

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.359
My name is Aidan Bloom.
I'm Sarah's husband.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.479
Oh!

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.239
Oh, hey.

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.742
How you doing? Nice to meet you.

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.959
I have been racking my brain trying

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:22.439
to figure out how to
handle this situation.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.510
Situation?

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.639
If you ever so much as
exhale near my wife again,

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.079
I promise to sue you
for sexual harassment.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:36.108
Stay away from my wife,
you wretched piece of shit.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.159
Dad?

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.399
That did not go as planned.

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.599
Are you okay?

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.119
I think you lost, Dad.

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.270
Here, put this on your eye.

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.189
We gotta go. Come on.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.919
Hey.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.479
Honey, oh, my God!
What happened to your eye?

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.119
I ran into Jerry at the supermarket.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.349
Oh, my God.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.719
Hey, Dad, I'm here.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.589
Look, I'm here. Toasted almond.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.519
What happened to your eye?

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.319
Oh. Don't worry about it, Dad.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.639
Don't worry about that at all.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.679
The point is I'm here, okay?

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.039
I'm here and Sarah's here
and the kids are here.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.559
And the rabbis are here
and we all love you.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.279
I'm sorry, I don't think
Noah's gonna make it, Dad.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:52.350
I did everything I could.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.301
Hmm.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:59.744
Thank you, Aidan.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.344
For what, Dad?

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:10.104
For doing your best to hold this
family together when I couldn't.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.428
How did you get that shiner?

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.870
I ran into someone who's been
harassing Sarah at work.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.191
So, yes.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.509
You went after him, huh?

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.830
I tried.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.704
That takes guts.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.825
Good for you.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.109
You showed up.

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.545
How are you feeling?

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.069
I'm not afraid.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.869
Isn't that funny?

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:01.542
I thought I'd be afraid.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.943
I think that's the bravest
thing I've ever heard.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:11.223
- Really?
- Yeah, I really do.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.039
You promise?

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.666
I promise you.

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.519
Do you see that

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.785
or is God very different
than I imagined?

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:40.028
Noah! That's Noah, Dad. You made it?

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.546
Dad, it's Noah. He made it.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.743
Noah, you're a warrior.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.628
No, I just won a contest.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.144
But you won.

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.545
Yeah.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.264
Yeah, Dad, I won.

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:19.068
I'm so proud of you.

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.982
I'm so tired.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.184
Hold my hands.

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.545
Right here. Right here, Dad.

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.745
We love you.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:48.304
If there's a next time,
I'll do better.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.110
So fast.

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.904
Try to remember how fast it goes.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:04.910
When we were kids, Noah and I used
to pretend that we were heroes

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:10.748
with swords, the only ones
who could save the day.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.504
But perhaps we set
the bar a little bit high.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:21.866
Maybe we're just the regular people.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.862
The ones who get saved.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.079
Hey!

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.359
Oh, my God!

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.359
Dude! This is because of you.
I got that part.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.079
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:55.719
They fucked you up.

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.119
Yeah, no, you were totally right.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.519
Soon as I get off the ship,
there's fucking Ractonians everywhere.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.679
I got crushed.

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.999
By the way, what's your name?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.399
- I'm Aidan.
- Hey, I'm Paul.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.719
- Nice to meet you.
- No, thank you again for that note.

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.621
I was just talking about you in a
meeting. I didn't have your number.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.119
I work with this little
theater company in Topanga.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.588
Have you ever given any
thought to teaching?

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.279
Not... No, no.

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.279
Well, look, we have these
classes for college kids

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.559
and we're looking for somebody new.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.269
The pay is just okay,
but the people are amazing.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.584
You should come by
and give it a look.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.479
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.599
They'd love you. Would you come by?

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.879
That'd be really cool.
I'd be honored.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.599
- Really? You'll come?
- Yeah.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.999
I'd give you my number, but I doubt

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.319
you have a phone
in your little onesie.

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.039
Yeah, no, I don't, but I've
got places I can put things.

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.199
- All right, let's do it.
- My trailer's right here.

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:43.599
- Will you come with me just two seconds?
- Of course.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.101
- Yeah, thank you.
- Wonderful.

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.159
The Blooms are willing to drop both

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.999
the sexual harassment and
public-battery charges

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.791
as long as we give her a year's
paid salary and you agree to this.

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.279
Ostensibly, it's a sexual
harassment workshop.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:02.079
The Blooms are adamant
that you need to attend.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.839
What the hell is this?

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.639
Well, it's typically a
three-month course,

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.079
but the Blooms are insisting
that you take it seven times.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.823
Oh! Also, you're fired.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.559
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.999
Are the Gilberts home?

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.679
Nobody home.

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.319
Oh, it's okay. I'm a
friend of the Gilberts

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.870
and they asked me to come by and fix
the drain at the bottom of their pool.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.839
But I'm leaving.

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.839
Oh, that's okay. I'll close the
gate behind me. Thank you.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.990
Mmm, AC feels good.

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.839
Dad, this is so embarrassing.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.479
Don't worry. The Gilberts
are in St. Tropez all spring.

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:51.839
It's their own fault for bragging.

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.319
Now before I let school
out for the semester,

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.471
we're gonna get you
ready for Jesse's party.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.799
I'm scared.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.347
I know.

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.431
I want you to jump in.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.319
But I don't know
anything about swimming.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.029
I know, sweetheart. I want you to
jump in. I'm gonna be here for you.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.519
If I die, I'm gonna
be so pissed at you.

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.465
We have a deal.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.385
Do it. Go for it.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.746
What lady is that, which doth
enrich the hand of yonder knight?

01:38:29.305 --> 01:38:35.805
