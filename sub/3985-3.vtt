00:56.110 --> 00:58.798
Yo, Renaldo!

00:58.947 --> 01:01.101
- Renaldo!
- Que?

01:01.248 --> 01:03.870
Next time you finish up the box,
you need to holler on it, yo.

01:04.018 --> 01:06.851
Sí sí.

01:47.928 --> 01:49.624
Hey, y'all, it's Omar.

01:53.534 --> 01:56.323
- Omar.
- There he is.

01:56.471 --> 01:58.440
- Omar step, yo.
- Omar, yo.

02:18.292 --> 02:19.612
Y'all ain't got
no Honey Nut?

02:19.761 --> 02:21.488
Whatever you see.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.887
And a carton of Newports.

02:28.034 --> 02:30.090
Omar comin'.

02:30.238 --> 02:32.730
Hey, y'all,
here he come.

02:39.447 --> 02:41.435
Omar. Omar.

02:41.581 --> 02:43.311
Omar strollin'.

03:36.904 --> 03:38.428
They don't have
the Honey Nut?

03:42.877 --> 03:46.433
- I don't even want this, dawg.
- Why not?

03:46.582 --> 03:48.435
It ain't what you're taking,

03:48.584 --> 03:50.517
it's who you taking it from,
you feel me?

03:54.189 --> 03:56.343
How you expect to run
with the wolves come night

03:56.490 --> 03:58.822
when you spend all day
sporting with the puppies?

05:46.100 --> 05:49.365
- So you staying with Royce, I see?
- What you mean?

05:51.505 --> 05:52.870
Oh, man.

05:54.810 --> 05:57.664
Makes sense since I know
you got your fill of Carcetti.

05:57.812 --> 06:00.233
They've been puttin' up
a crop of these things

06:00.381 --> 06:02.816
on every lawn
on the block.

06:06.220 --> 06:09.876
And as fast as I take 'em down,
they bring more.

06:10.025 --> 06:12.078
That's what they do
this time of year.

06:12.226 --> 06:14.525
I see you're
at your leisure.

06:16.331 --> 06:18.084
I work two nights a week,

06:18.232 --> 06:21.496
three day shifts
and no weekends.

06:22.503 --> 06:24.723
I'm off till this afternoon.

06:24.872 --> 06:26.392
You're good with it?

06:26.540 --> 06:29.962
It ain't the Hopkins gig,
but it'll do.

06:30.111 --> 06:34.867
Pullin' 52, good bennies,
got a take-home car.

06:35.015 --> 06:38.905
I mean the hotel manager's
a pain in the ass, but still.

06:39.053 --> 06:42.609
Well, if you was a bit free,
I heard something.

06:42.758 --> 06:46.479
This thing over at University of
Maryland School of Social Work--

06:46.627 --> 06:50.382
- they got a grant. Big money.
- Just stop.

06:50.531 --> 06:52.919
Half a million to look at
repeat violent offenders,

06:53.067 --> 06:55.254
clinical intervention--
all that mess.

06:55.403 --> 06:57.089
So they gonna study
some shit, huh?

06:57.238 --> 07:01.728
Melvin, I had me a good helping
of them downtown, tie-wearing,

07:01.876 --> 07:06.032
come-to-do-good, stay-to-do-well
college types last year.

07:06.180 --> 07:08.601
You sure? 'Cause I sold 'em on it,
should you want it.

07:08.749 --> 07:11.871
Bunny, you're a big man
down on the campus.

07:12.018 --> 07:13.973
You the police
that legalized it.

07:14.121 --> 07:16.209
The college boys
loved that mess.

07:16.357 --> 07:17.845
Nobody else did, though.

07:17.992 --> 07:20.847
Well, I tried.

07:20.995 --> 07:24.828
You did.

07:27.935 --> 07:29.926
Yo, blacktops, pandemic.

07:32.406 --> 07:35.028
Pandemic,
got that pandemic.

07:35.176 --> 07:37.667
Pandemic.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.945
My mac, pandemic,
blacktops right here.

07:52.494 --> 07:54.347
That's my boy, right?

07:54.495 --> 07:56.749
Ain't taking no handouts,
but he workin' for it.

07:56.898 --> 07:58.750
See what I mean?

07:58.899 --> 08:01.561
This nigga's made
a little something out of this corner.

08:02.870 --> 08:06.659
Now hold on, son.
We're just talking now.

08:06.806 --> 08:11.664
- All right?
- Man, y'all did good with this spot.

08:11.812 --> 08:13.598
You a rightful hustler.

08:13.747 --> 08:16.969
What's your name again, man?
Boney? Biddy?

08:17.117 --> 08:19.238
- What's it now?
- You know my name.

08:19.386 --> 08:21.507
Yeah, but now
here's the thing:

08:21.655 --> 08:23.843
With this spot
all built up and shit,

08:23.991 --> 08:25.946
- we need it, yo.
- Yeah.

08:26.094 --> 08:28.114
- What?
- Two choices:

08:28.262 --> 08:30.416
You can start taking our packages
or you can step off.

08:30.565 --> 08:33.251
My man Chris is
gonna holla at you, all right?

08:33.399 --> 08:35.129
You tell him
what it need to be.

08:37.972 --> 08:40.393
Don't wait for the pandemic.
It's right here, y'all.

08:40.541 --> 08:42.566
Don't sleep
on the pandemic.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.468
I want to know more
about that boy right there.

08:48.617 --> 08:50.269
Got good signs on him.

08:50.418 --> 08:52.338
Big paws on a puppy, huh?

08:52.486 --> 08:55.842
Yeah, big paws
on a puppy.

08:55.990 --> 08:57.377
To a "T,"

08:57.526 --> 08:59.345
Get that blacktop
before you flop.

08:59.494 --> 09:01.482
Get that pandemic.

09:01.630 --> 09:03.883
The truth is we don't know
why he was killed.

09:04.032 --> 09:06.719
It could have had something to do
with him being a witness

09:06.866 --> 09:09.722
or it could be unrelated.

09:09.869 --> 09:12.258
Now, whoever leaked that shit
to Carcetti's camp,

09:12.406 --> 09:17.096
- they lied on us.
- Yeah, well, that's it.

09:17.244 --> 09:21.300
Eight points--
close as Carcetti gets.

09:21.448 --> 09:24.437
He wants to go
big dick with me?

09:24.585 --> 09:26.406
I'll show him
what he can't handle.

09:26.553 --> 09:28.441
We put it out there:

09:28.589 --> 09:30.643
Anyone contributing
to both sides

09:30.792 --> 09:32.445
gets frozen out
of my next term.

09:32.594 --> 09:35.114
- No one rides the middle anymore.
- Done.

09:35.262 --> 09:39.851
Next, I want DPW and HCD
out there today

09:40.000 --> 09:42.355
tearing down
all Carcetti's signs.

09:42.503 --> 09:45.725
Any lamppost, median,
any city-owned buildings,

09:45.872 --> 09:47.960
unless the homeowner's
out there arguing,

09:48.108 --> 09:49.228
- tear it down.
- Done.

09:49.377 --> 09:51.230
Third, I want transpo

09:51.378 --> 09:53.866
camped outside of
Carcetti's headquarters.

09:54.014 --> 09:58.005
Any car, any violation,
the meter flag goes up,

09:58.152 --> 10:00.773
- inspection sticker-- tow it.
- Done.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.811
Next, you two,
slow it down.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.815
Nothing else comes out
about that murder

10:07.963 --> 10:10.216
until after the primary.

10:10.365 --> 10:11.818
And I want both of you

10:11.966 --> 10:15.321
to go to the press
and talk down that witness angle.

10:15.469 --> 10:18.356
Take the full weight
either way it goes.

10:18.505 --> 10:21.394
Clarence, I'm running dead even
with Bond right now.

10:21.542 --> 10:24.010
How are you gonna be running
if I drop you from the ticket?

10:26.746 --> 10:29.302
Okay, that's it.
Thank you, gentlemen.

10:29.450 --> 10:31.370
Go to it. Now.

10:31.519 --> 10:34.009
- Mr. Mayor.
- Mm-hmm.

10:43.797 --> 10:46.519
- What?
- Carcetti has a point.

10:46.666 --> 10:49.255
I went down to Annapolis,

10:49.403 --> 10:51.456
got matching funds
for witness protection.

10:51.605 --> 10:54.994
You didn't earmark a dime
to put 'em into play.

10:55.142 --> 10:58.864
- Next fiscal year.
- Don't claim poverty on this.

10:59.013 --> 11:00.899
We're only talking
a quarter of a million.

11:01.048 --> 11:04.237
I match those funds now
and that motherfucker Carcetti,

11:04.385 --> 11:06.240
he's got a campaign highlight:

11:06.387 --> 11:09.275
"Tommy Carcetti expands
witness protection program.

11:09.423 --> 11:11.110
Fought for
and won extra funds."

11:11.258 --> 11:13.012
Hell with that!

11:13.161 --> 11:16.721
I go after that state-match funds
after the election.

11:50.898 --> 11:52.919
Naw naw,
I paid for three pills.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.353
Look, blue shirt
gets two.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.656
- Naw, I get two.
- White shirt gets one.

11:56.804 --> 11:59.090
- Cheatin' motherfucker.
- I get four.

11:59.239 --> 12:02.463
Look, blue shirt gets two,
white one, no shirt one.

12:02.611 --> 12:05.064
Now y'all can take what
y'all paid for and walk away

12:05.213 --> 12:07.999
or just walk away with nothing.
Motherfuck a refund.

12:08.148 --> 12:09.835
No, nigga,
I paid for three.

12:09.983 --> 12:13.906
You need to rethink what putting
a hand on me's gonna get you.

12:14.054 --> 12:17.546
You can thank your friend here
for snatching away y'all highs.

12:19.293 --> 12:21.625
Yo yo, hold up, hold up.
Can I get my two?

12:28.936 --> 12:30.656
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

12:30.804 --> 12:34.794
You don't rattle. Yo, you come up
under my wing, young'un,

12:34.942 --> 12:36.796
you ain't gonna do nothin'
but rise, man.

12:36.944 --> 12:39.465
I don't even know why
you thinkin' about quittin'.

12:39.614 --> 12:41.099
Look, man,
like I already told you--

12:41.248 --> 12:43.436
I'm all the way repaid,
and tomorrow's school.

12:43.584 --> 12:46.406
Come on, man, what the fuck
do you want to go to school for?

12:46.553 --> 12:49.407
What do you want to be?
An astronaut?

12:49.556 --> 12:52.047
A dentist?
A pay lawyer, nigga?

12:53.627 --> 12:55.282
Look, check it out:

12:55.429 --> 12:57.583
Why don't you just come
down here after school

12:57.731 --> 13:00.019
and just work
these rush hours for me.

13:00.167 --> 13:02.067
How about that?

13:17.417 --> 13:19.977
Hey. Hey.

13:24.391 --> 13:26.518
That's great. Thank you.
I know that kind of money--

13:28.396 --> 13:32.351
I said I know that kind of money
doesn't come easy to anyone.

13:32.499 --> 13:34.521
No, it's just something
on my end here--

13:34.668 --> 13:37.423
some construction
or something-- right.

13:37.571 --> 13:40.025
Yeah, right.
Thanks again.

13:40.174 --> 13:42.895
Two hours, 30 grand.

13:43.042 --> 13:44.563
Am I getting the hang
of this or what?

13:44.711 --> 13:47.000
What the fuck is that?

13:47.147 --> 13:49.168
DPW's tearing up
the sidewalk

13:49.315 --> 13:50.503
right outside our door.

13:50.651 --> 13:53.172
You really pissed him off.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.074
Yes, I did, didn't l?

13:55.223 --> 13:57.276
Come on.
Door-to-door in lrvington.

13:57.424 --> 14:00.985
- Right.
- And we got that dead witness tonight.

14:18.979 --> 14:22.500
Yeah. Federal?

14:22.648 --> 14:25.538
Naw, she ain't no federal.

14:25.686 --> 14:27.307
That there a city girl.

14:27.454 --> 14:30.709
I like shorty too.
She's all right...

14:30.858 --> 14:32.793
as long as she don't
get in my way.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.584
Re-up right there.

14:38.732 --> 14:40.553
Por qué?

14:40.701 --> 14:42.855
School ain't starting
till tomorrow, right?

14:43.003 --> 14:46.058
The little one'll be all dressed up
with nowhere to go.

14:46.206 --> 14:48.036
Yeah, you know it too,
don't you, girl?

14:49.542 --> 14:52.231
The camera-- if you go
in front, they're gonna--

14:52.379 --> 14:53.833
They're supposed
to know it's me, man.

14:53.982 --> 14:55.868
I'm my own trademark.
You feel me?

14:56.016 --> 14:57.737
Sí, but if they know
it's you, then--

14:57.885 --> 15:00.005
What, you scared
on bein' made, huh?

15:00.153 --> 15:02.008
Claro que sí.

15:02.156 --> 15:05.511
How 'bout I put you
in one of them full-body bunny suits?

15:05.659 --> 15:08.651
You'd be like a six-foot rabbit
putting a pistol in their face.

15:25.812 --> 15:28.280
Let me get a pack
of Juicy Fruit.

15:39.459 --> 15:42.281
You look like one of them
half-soul, half-Chinese types

15:42.430 --> 15:44.363
from Vietnam and shit.

15:47.901 --> 15:49.994
Come again now,
Mama-san.

16:07.555 --> 16:09.642
Patience, girl.

16:09.791 --> 16:11.654
More patience.

16:12.993 --> 16:16.750
The guy drives a shit box.
He's got a two-bit minimart,

16:16.897 --> 16:19.151
but the back door in there
is reinforced steel,

16:19.298 --> 16:21.687
and the security camera
on the street is high-end.

16:21.835 --> 16:25.391
Not only that, but I think
I made the re-up today:

16:25.539 --> 16:28.560
Schoolgirl with
a heavy backpack.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.663
Hmm. Well, I pulled
Andre's phone history

16:30.811 --> 16:32.531
trying to find
Marlo's organization,

16:32.678 --> 16:35.001
cross-referencing DNRs
to other cells.

16:35.148 --> 16:37.302
This is Fruit.
This is Monk,

16:37.451 --> 16:39.238
and there's three or four
other good probables.

16:39.386 --> 16:42.209
Not likely to find a direct line
to Marlo that way.

16:42.356 --> 16:44.542
Andre had to go through Monk
to get to him.

16:44.691 --> 16:46.779
No, but we might get
a cell on Chris Partlow,

16:46.927 --> 16:49.048
or for tote or for one,
of the top lieutenants.

16:49.197 --> 16:51.050
- We're gettin' close.
- Uh-huh.

16:51.199 --> 16:54.153
Deputy pulled me downtown.
You guys aren't into any shit,

16:54.301 --> 16:55.529
- are you?
- No, sir.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.540
Good he wasn't down
at the ocean today.

17:04.276 --> 17:06.965
And the subpoenas?

17:07.114 --> 17:08.467
You won't see
a page of anything

17:08.615 --> 17:10.167
until after the primary.

17:10.317 --> 17:11.669
After that,
if a document lands

17:11.818 --> 17:13.439
and there's no one
there to read it,

17:13.587 --> 17:15.540
will the mayor and his people
honestly give a shit?

17:15.689 --> 17:17.209
Other than that,
what can I tell you

17:17.357 --> 17:19.723
except to get that unit
back on the street where it belongs?

17:22.029 --> 17:27.086
Lieutenant, you are relieved
from command of Major Crimes.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.655
You've done exceptional work,
and in light of that,

17:29.803 --> 17:31.556
we want you to improve
the performance

17:31.705 --> 17:33.558
of another vital aspect
of our mission--

17:33.707 --> 17:35.426
- Sir?
- Telephone Reporting Unit.

17:35.574 --> 17:38.429
You report there
tomorrow, 0800.

17:38.578 --> 17:41.667
Have I done
something wrong?

17:41.815 --> 17:44.270
Lieutenant Marimow will be
taking over Major Crimes.

17:44.417 --> 17:47.910
If you need to brief him,
do so promptly.

17:49.890 --> 17:51.776
Yes, sir.

17:51.925 --> 17:53.779
Jimmy, how's that
beach house coming?

17:53.927 --> 17:57.083
Beach...
um, fine, sir--

17:57.231 --> 17:59.664
Great. Sounds great.

18:09.109 --> 18:11.076
Yeah, hand me
the colander, will you?

18:14.047 --> 18:15.200
He's early.

18:15.348 --> 18:17.474
You get the door.
I'll do that.

18:20.119 --> 18:21.407
- Hey!
- Hey!

18:21.555 --> 18:23.642
Come in.

18:23.791 --> 18:26.578
- Ooh, smells good.
- Spaghetti-- nothing fancy.

18:26.726 --> 18:28.180
"Côtes du Rhône"?

18:28.328 --> 18:30.883
Yeah, the sommelier
behind the plexi said it was dry.

18:31.032 --> 18:33.820
- Hey, Beadie!
- Hey, Bunk, how you doing?

18:33.967 --> 18:36.288
Whoa, look at you!
Blonde and all.

18:36.437 --> 18:38.489
- You like it?
- I do, I do.

18:38.638 --> 18:40.059
Hey, kids.

18:40.207 --> 18:42.727
This is Jack, that's Cary.
This is Detective Moreland.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.028
- Hi.
- Hi!

18:44.177 --> 18:46.165
- Call me Bunk.
- Let me open this wine.

18:46.312 --> 18:49.134
Yeah, that's right.
Let that shit breathe.

18:49.282 --> 18:51.636
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

18:51.785 --> 18:54.840
- That's all right. They hear worse.
- Yeah, no doubt.

18:54.988 --> 18:56.141
So, you want ice
in yours?

18:56.289 --> 18:58.278
No, man, that's
a double-digit vino.

18:58.425 --> 19:01.758
- Even has a cork.
- Swell.

19:03.864 --> 19:06.553
- I like your binders.
- Thanks!

19:06.701 --> 19:08.420
McNulty gave them to us.

19:08.568 --> 19:10.089
- McNulty?
- Yeah.

19:10.238 --> 19:11.458
- Not Jimmy?
- No.

19:11.605 --> 19:13.592
Uncle Jimmy? Jim?

19:13.740 --> 19:14.927
- No.
- No?

19:15.075 --> 19:16.094
Daddy? Pops?

19:16.242 --> 19:18.062
McNulty.

19:18.211 --> 19:20.873
Oh, just plain McNulty.

19:23.884 --> 19:25.771
And if I take
his weak-ass product,

19:25.918 --> 19:28.707
that means I'll be makin' less money,
you know what I'm sayin'?

19:28.855 --> 19:30.209
Only reason I could bring
any life to this strip

19:30.357 --> 19:32.144
is because of the good shit
that y'all was givin' me.

19:32.293 --> 19:34.480
then I'm standing here like
a asshole holding my Charles Dickens

19:34.627 --> 19:36.181
'cause I ain't got
no muscle, no backup.

19:36.329 --> 19:39.519
Shit, man. Yo, if this
was the old days?

19:39.666 --> 19:42.287
Yeah, now, well,
the thing about the old days,

19:42.435 --> 19:44.957
they the old days.

19:45.105 --> 19:47.164
People I'm working with now...

19:49.376 --> 19:51.896
So you want to bump with Marlo
over real estate?

19:52.045 --> 19:55.200
You're on your own.
But if you want my advice--

19:55.348 --> 19:57.737
I don't, man.
I don't.

19:57.884 --> 20:00.852
Bodie. Yo, Bodie.

20:03.423 --> 20:04.611
Me?
I lost the wholesale

20:04.758 --> 20:06.579
to every crew
in Winchester homes.

20:06.726 --> 20:09.515
Them horses takin'
Marlo's shit now.

20:09.663 --> 20:12.552
He pushin' the independents
over hilltop, too.

20:12.700 --> 20:16.422
I lost three crews
there this month.

20:16.570 --> 20:17.856
What about the East Side?

20:18.004 --> 20:19.557
There we got
a much bigger problem:

20:19.706 --> 20:21.559
all those ugly-ass bitches
in Yankee hats

20:21.708 --> 20:23.494
chasin' all
the locals away.

20:23.642 --> 20:25.663
I heard them New York boys
ran off most of Delroy's people,

20:25.811 --> 20:28.333
and those that stay
gotta take they package.

20:28.481 --> 20:31.171
Man, all this theorizing
about how it be product,

20:31.318 --> 20:33.137
not territory?

20:33.286 --> 20:34.339
You can't talk that shit

20:34.486 --> 20:36.075
if a nigga snatchin'
all of the territory

20:36.223 --> 20:37.710
an' won't take
none of your product.

20:37.857 --> 20:40.612
See, the thing is Marlo's
only takin' a little bite.

20:40.760 --> 20:44.083
Them New York cats is like
Wal-Mart comin' to town.

20:44.231 --> 20:47.353
Me, personally, I think
it's time Wal-Mart went home.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.356
If we gonna bump with 'em,
it's got to be all of us.

20:50.503 --> 20:53.459
I tell you what: I'd like to see
Marlo with us in on that one.

20:53.606 --> 20:56.428
You know what I mean?
One big Baltimore team.

20:56.576 --> 20:59.976
Yeah, Marlo can make an inconvenient
nigga disappear, can't he?

21:01.447 --> 21:02.835
I heard he got
some kinda hookup

21:02.983 --> 21:05.104
at this funeral home
in Westport.

21:05.253 --> 21:07.505
Coffin goes in there
needs two pallbearers.

21:07.654 --> 21:09.942
Come out, you need eight
to carry that bitch,

21:10.090 --> 21:11.511
you know what I mean?

21:11.658 --> 21:14.046
Nah nah. He usin'
them shut-up rowhouses.

21:14.194 --> 21:17.851
Dump a body in there, no one
can tell one smell from another.

21:17.998 --> 21:22.654
Well, whatever he doin',
he cold, but he ain't stupid.

21:22.802 --> 21:27.024
Think it's time to try again
to talk to the boy.

21:27.173 --> 21:30.095
I hope you got better shit
to say than Stringer

21:30.243 --> 21:35.612
'cause young'un ain't given
no one an ear yet.

21:36.816 --> 21:39.138
Dang, Jimmy, you're
a domesticated motherfucker.

21:39.287 --> 21:40.339
Yeah, I guess I am.

21:40.486 --> 21:42.274
Yeah, we're good.

21:42.422 --> 21:43.877
How's everything
at the port?

21:44.024 --> 21:46.178
- Quiet.
- It's quiet everywhere.

21:46.327 --> 21:48.580
- Even the Western.
- Yeah.

21:48.728 --> 21:50.649
I'm having a hard time
with it, though.

21:50.797 --> 21:51.884
Somethin' ain't right.

21:52.032 --> 21:53.319
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.

21:53.466 --> 21:55.822
- You working something?
- Yeah, I got this one case.

21:55.970 --> 21:59.191
I know who the shooter is
but can't find him.

21:59.340 --> 22:00.772
He'll turn up.

22:01.708 --> 22:05.029
- Maybe.
- More?

22:05.177 --> 22:06.865
Oh, mercy.
No, ma'am.

22:07.012 --> 22:08.133
Dessert?

22:08.281 --> 22:11.103
I was thinking we might
go out for a little taste.

22:11.251 --> 22:14.071
Unless you got to
tuck in the kids.

22:14.220 --> 22:17.309
- I don't know.
- Oh, it's fine, Jimmy. You go.

22:17.457 --> 22:19.288
I'll tuck 'em in.

22:23.897 --> 22:25.184
She trusts you.

22:25.332 --> 22:27.733
Yeah.

22:33.073 --> 22:36.895
Can't go to dinner without
catching a page, huh? What now?

22:37.043 --> 22:40.699
Her john jumps in the shower.
She rummages his wallet.

22:40.846 --> 22:43.302
He figures it out
and beats on her

22:43.449 --> 22:46.044
till the people next door
call the front desk.

23:08.641 --> 23:10.529
Sir, if she doesn't have
the money on her,

23:10.677 --> 23:12.964
I don't know
what I can do.

23:13.112 --> 23:14.666
Did you beat
that woman in there?

23:14.814 --> 23:16.735
I just want
my money back.

23:16.883 --> 23:17.970
Excuse me, Mr. Gergen.

23:18.118 --> 23:20.586
I need a moment
with my director of security.

23:25.925 --> 23:28.281
If she presses charges,
I'm cuffin' that motherfucker.

23:28.428 --> 23:29.647
Mr. Colvin, this is
a delicate matter.

23:29.796 --> 23:30.782
"Delicate"? Shit.

23:30.930 --> 23:33.552
Mr. Gergen represents
a national consortium

23:33.700 --> 23:36.022
of convention planners,
and he's been a friend of the hotel--

23:36.170 --> 23:38.657
Mr. Colvin?
Mr. Colvin?

23:38.806 --> 23:41.193
Now, you took his cash
and he beat you good, huh?

23:41.342 --> 23:43.673
How much
he beat you for?

23:45.145 --> 23:47.272
How much?

23:55.855 --> 23:57.618
Give me the cuffs.

23:59.392 --> 24:01.326
No, Mr. Colvin. I...

24:04.130 --> 24:05.517
What the fuck is this?

24:05.665 --> 24:08.454
She steals my money,
and you're gonna lock me up?

24:08.601 --> 24:09.856
You're gettin' charged
with assault.

24:10.004 --> 24:11.356
You wanna charge her
with the theft,

24:11.504 --> 24:13.158
I'll put the cuffs
on her, too.

24:13.306 --> 24:14.727
But you in a wagon,
shitbird.

24:14.874 --> 24:15.926
Mr. Colvin,
this is not acceptable.

24:16.075 --> 24:17.829
No. He's goin'
in a wagon.

24:17.977 --> 24:19.630
Mr. Colvin,
I have to insist.

24:19.778 --> 24:20.965
30 years
a police officer,

24:21.113 --> 24:22.534
I never took cuffs
off a right charge.

24:22.681 --> 24:24.069
Ain't about to start now.

24:24.217 --> 24:26.371
You're not a police officer,
Mr. Colvin.

24:26.519 --> 24:28.577
You work for us.

25:25.712 --> 25:27.565
Naw, I'm good.

25:27.714 --> 25:31.569
You nursin' that thing
like a baby bird.

25:31.718 --> 25:36.440
You know those little corner joints
in the ghetto

25:36.589 --> 25:41.026
that sell subs,
and fried chicken, lake trout?

25:42.629 --> 25:44.220
Lake trout?

25:45.598 --> 25:47.919
Like egg creams
in New York.

25:48.067 --> 25:49.221
No eggs, no cream.

25:49.369 --> 25:50.423
Exactly.

25:50.571 --> 25:53.625
No lake, no trout.

25:53.773 --> 25:56.928
They're pogies.
Whitefish, trash fish.

25:57.076 --> 26:00.198
Exactly.
White trash fish.

26:00.346 --> 26:02.769
I mean, "lake trout."
That's all marketing.

26:02.916 --> 26:06.283
It's just all dressed up
like something it ain't.

26:08.956 --> 26:11.355
You know
what I'm sayin'?

26:14.294 --> 26:16.160
Sometimes it is what it is.

26:18.231 --> 26:20.028
It really is.

26:23.169 --> 26:25.195
That's deep.

26:28.508 --> 26:29.795
I like the way
you think.

26:29.944 --> 26:31.467
Yeah, you too.

26:38.451 --> 26:40.385
Hold on.

26:42.056 --> 26:45.777
Dang, Bug, if you can tie one shoe,
you can tie the other one.

26:45.925 --> 26:47.547
You hear me?

26:47.694 --> 26:50.715
Cookies all on your face.

26:50.863 --> 26:53.093
Come on.

26:57.104 --> 26:59.125
What up, shorty?
Ready for the first day?

26:59.273 --> 27:01.059
Yeah, he can't wait
to be in the third grade.

27:01.207 --> 27:02.728
Ain't that right, Bug?

27:02.875 --> 27:04.695
'Sup?

27:04.844 --> 27:06.573
Dukie.

27:11.317 --> 27:13.217
Cool.

27:23.529 --> 27:26.985
Look at all these big-ass
eighth graders out here.

27:27.133 --> 27:30.388
Look like some sixth-graders
gonna get banked.

27:30.537 --> 27:32.458
Yo, come in here.
I wanna show y'all somethin'.

27:32.605 --> 27:34.159
Go ahead, Bug.

27:34.307 --> 27:37.229
Yo, what up, boy?
That jersey's crazy, son.

27:37.378 --> 27:39.368
Where you get that at?

27:47.754 --> 27:49.074
Yo, check it.

27:49.222 --> 27:50.808
This dude in the joint
with my father drew these.

27:50.957 --> 27:52.409
I'm about
to get one on my arm.

27:52.558 --> 27:54.679
Is this you? Why would you
get yourself on your arm?

27:54.827 --> 27:56.348
In case you forget
what you look like?

27:56.496 --> 27:57.849
Yo, what do
these mean, man?

27:57.998 --> 27:59.885
A'ight,
this one means "heart"--

28:00.033 --> 28:01.186
Iike, you know,
"He got heart"--

28:01.334 --> 28:02.654
and that means "lion."

28:02.802 --> 28:03.755
How you know that?

28:03.903 --> 28:04.923
Word, the dude
could be playing you.

28:05.072 --> 28:06.459
Like, this one,
instead of "heart,"

28:06.607 --> 28:08.527
it could mean like
"bitch" or something.

28:08.675 --> 28:12.430
And like this one, it could mean
like "pussy" or "clown."

28:12.577 --> 28:14.766
Come on, man.
Fuck y'all motherfuckers.

28:14.914 --> 28:17.034
- They probably do, too.
- Man, get outta my house.

28:17.183 --> 28:18.570
Understand something
about me:

28:18.717 --> 28:22.207
I may be wearing
these bars,

28:22.355 --> 28:25.076
but I worked the bricks
to earn 'em,

28:25.223 --> 28:29.281
and I am stone-cold police
first, last, and always.

28:29.429 --> 28:30.850
Froze my balls off
in the winter,

28:30.997 --> 28:33.184
sweated 'em in the summer,
ran, jumped,

28:33.332 --> 28:38.023
rolled in the dirt with
the bad guys 24/7/365.

28:38.172 --> 28:40.759
Now, I'm a great admirer
of this unit.

28:40.907 --> 28:45.864
Avon Barksdale? That was
a 14-point buck you bagged.

28:46.012 --> 28:48.199
However, we are
gonna do better.

28:48.347 --> 28:50.467
And if there's a case
to be made out there,

28:50.616 --> 28:52.237
we'll make it together

28:52.384 --> 28:56.575
with good work
and good supervision of that work.

28:56.723 --> 29:01.079
I want to be briefed
every step of the way.

29:01.227 --> 29:02.990
Questions?

29:06.999 --> 29:08.227
No?

29:09.236 --> 29:10.725
Good.

29:21.848 --> 29:23.567
Yo, who you got?

29:23.716 --> 29:27.771
I got... "Prez"--
"Prez"-- what?

29:27.920 --> 29:32.177
I got Mrs. Scott. Fuckin' hate
that foul bitch, man.

29:32.324 --> 29:34.412
Man, she ain't that bad.
At least you ain't got Sampson.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.447
Yeah, I know.

29:35.595 --> 29:37.324
Yo, Michael,
who you got?

29:43.302 --> 29:46.024
"Presborowski"?
"Prez"--

29:46.173 --> 29:48.800
Yo, he new and white.
We got it made.

30:00.153 --> 30:03.108
Uh-oh, look at this.

30:03.256 --> 30:05.553
Where is your fine
take-home car?

30:07.360 --> 30:09.658
Got took home.

30:12.098 --> 30:14.258
We need to talk.

30:38.958 --> 30:40.912
Sixth grade is
on the first floor!

30:41.059 --> 30:43.515
Seventh grade is
on the second.

30:43.663 --> 30:47.385
Eighth-grade homeroom
is on the third floor!

30:47.533 --> 30:50.088
Don't go up
the down staircase.

30:50.236 --> 30:52.524
Quickly and quietly,
people.

30:52.672 --> 30:55.061
I see you, Quantell.

30:55.208 --> 30:57.162
I see you too.

30:57.310 --> 31:00.369
School's getting ready
to start. Come on.

31:02.014 --> 31:04.334
Hi, dear.
Good to see you back.

31:04.482 --> 31:06.270
Yo, what up, Turner.
You back for more?

31:06.418 --> 31:09.908
Aw, damn, man.
I love the first day, son.

31:10.056 --> 31:12.043
Everybody all friendly
an' shit.

31:12.191 --> 31:14.955
Namond Brice.
Already, we're starting?

31:22.268 --> 31:23.521
Damn, man.

31:23.669 --> 31:25.357
Next time, they stay
in my drawer.

31:25.504 --> 31:27.593
Yo, whatever, man.

31:27.740 --> 31:29.640
I know, right?
Already, son.

31:36.782 --> 31:39.546
I know, right?
We're seventh graders.

31:56.302 --> 31:58.090
Yo, dang.
You see Neesy?

31:58.237 --> 32:00.191
Yo, them bitches

32:00.340 --> 32:03.061
Word, son.
Send them bitches to lran.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.143
That shit'd be over
in a heartbeat.

32:12.485 --> 32:15.078
Okay, check the chart
to see where you're sitting.

32:17.356 --> 32:19.910
Check the chart.

32:20.059 --> 32:21.145
Hi, I'm Randy.

32:21.293 --> 32:23.353
How are you doing,
Randy?

32:27.467 --> 32:29.627
Check the chart.

32:41.380 --> 32:43.245
Okay. Good morning.

32:45.884 --> 32:47.647
Okay, good morning.

32:48.654 --> 32:50.747
Yo! Shut up!

32:53.459 --> 32:55.446
Good morning.

32:55.594 --> 32:58.116
I'm your homeroom teacher,
obviously.

32:58.264 --> 33:00.352
My name is
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

33:00.499 --> 33:03.434
But you can call me
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

33:10.010 --> 33:12.239
Okay. Let's find out
who you are.

33:13.546 --> 33:14.999
This is Mrs. Donnelly.

33:15.146 --> 33:16.533
Teachers, we had trouble
with first bells,

33:16.682 --> 33:19.369
so expect the class change
to ring in one minute.

33:19.517 --> 33:23.977
Students will walk, not run,
to classes in an orderly manner.

33:25.658 --> 33:28.612
Okay, um, we'll, uh,

33:28.761 --> 33:31.821
get to know each other
a little later.

33:45.378 --> 33:47.499
Sorry. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

33:47.646 --> 33:49.944
Latifah.

33:51.150 --> 33:53.083
Uh, sorry.

33:58.324 --> 34:00.379
Where my bus passes at?

34:00.526 --> 34:02.580
Crystal Judkins,
you're not listed.

34:02.727 --> 34:05.083
Crystal? I look
like Crystal to you?

34:05.231 --> 34:07.427
I'm Charlene.

34:08.868 --> 34:10.154
Ronald Parker?

34:10.302 --> 34:13.192
Ha. Karim Williams.
Ronald over there.

34:13.339 --> 34:15.659
Aw Jeez.

34:15.809 --> 34:18.096
Yo, Mr. Prez, I need a hall pass
for the bathroom.

34:18.244 --> 34:19.331
It's an emergency.

34:19.478 --> 34:21.275
Everyone, I need
those bus passes back.

34:23.014 --> 34:25.335
Hold on. Whoa.
Everyone, stay where you are.

34:25.484 --> 34:27.371
Stay where--
I need those passes back.

34:27.518 --> 34:29.139
It's an emergency.
Mr. Prez...

34:29.286 --> 34:31.775
Everyone, I need
those bus passes back.

34:31.924 --> 34:32.844
The kids that need them...

34:32.992 --> 34:33.978
- Mr. Prez...
- What?

34:34.126 --> 34:35.112
Just take one.

34:35.260 --> 34:36.581
I need those
bus passes back!

34:36.728 --> 34:38.650
No one leaves this room

34:38.797 --> 34:41.786
until Mr. Pryzbylewski
gets those bus passes back.

34:41.934 --> 34:44.425
Do I need
to say that twice?

34:46.839 --> 34:48.359
Thank you.

34:48.507 --> 34:50.703
Thank you.

34:56.281 --> 34:58.580
You'll get the hang of it.

35:19.972 --> 35:22.099
Come in.

35:24.544 --> 35:26.230
Are you coming in
or what?

35:26.378 --> 35:28.403
I'm coming in, okay?

35:41.161 --> 35:42.446
You asked
to see me, sir?

35:42.594 --> 35:44.529
I did.

35:53.839 --> 35:57.128
Seeing as how I like to know
my boys in depth:

35:57.277 --> 35:59.964
why'd you want this unit?

36:00.112 --> 36:02.702
Honestly?

36:02.850 --> 36:05.203
I took the sergeant's test,
scored pretty high,

36:05.350 --> 36:08.239
but not high enough.
And Lieutenant Hoskins,

36:08.386 --> 36:10.074
we went through
the academy together.

36:10.221 --> 36:12.110
He said that this--
this is a good detail

36:12.258 --> 36:13.544
for going up the ladder.

36:13.692 --> 36:16.180
I mean I know
you have to do it for a while,

36:16.327 --> 36:19.216
but maybe next year,
if I do good here,

36:19.365 --> 36:22.921
they'll reach down for me.

36:23.068 --> 36:25.155
Next year, huh?

36:25.304 --> 36:27.636
I mean, for some things,
that's a long time to wait.

36:29.975 --> 36:31.797
Excuse me?

36:31.944 --> 36:33.798
I hear you're a good cop.

36:33.946 --> 36:35.833
I also hear you recognize
who your friends are

36:35.982 --> 36:39.003
and that
you're loyal to them.

36:39.151 --> 36:40.438
Did I hear
all that right?

36:40.586 --> 36:42.451
Absolutely.

36:44.422 --> 36:46.343
Where are you
on the list?

36:46.492 --> 36:50.948
32. They took 15, but--

36:51.095 --> 36:53.951
Thirt-- man, I thought you were
gonna say something like 60,

36:54.099 --> 36:56.034
or, you know, 95.

36:58.671 --> 37:02.461
Hey, let me call
my man Burrell.

37:02.608 --> 37:04.496
No need in wasting
good police like you

37:04.643 --> 37:06.731
chauffeuring
around politicians.

37:06.879 --> 37:08.267
I don't even know
what to say, Mr. Mayor.

37:08.414 --> 37:11.769
This-- this is unexpected.

37:11.916 --> 37:14.839
Don't mention it.

37:14.986 --> 37:18.875
Today being the first day,
let's have some fun.

37:19.024 --> 37:20.678
I'm gonna throw you
a little math puzzle,

37:20.826 --> 37:24.314
see if I can get you
thinking on your feet.

37:24.463 --> 37:27.318
Andre is leaving Baltimore...

37:27.466 --> 37:29.955
Uh, Mr. Prezbo,
I need to change my seat

37:30.102 --> 37:32.229
'cause this boy here
smells like a garbage can.

37:34.206 --> 37:37.128
All right, you need to work a little
on your compassion skills.

37:37.277 --> 37:38.464
Yeah, he needs
to work a little

37:38.612 --> 37:41.205
on his soap
and water skills.

37:42.916 --> 37:45.302
All right,
like I was saying,

37:45.451 --> 37:47.538
uh, my friend Andre
is leaving Baltimore.

37:47.686 --> 37:49.639
He's going
60 miles an hour--

37:49.788 --> 37:52.342
Hey, what side of Baltimore,
east or west?

37:52.491 --> 37:53.945
It doesn't make
any difference.

37:54.093 --> 37:56.848
That's what you think.

37:56.997 --> 37:58.987
Okay, east.

38:01.767 --> 38:04.690
West, west, okay?

38:04.838 --> 38:07.325
Okay.

38:07.473 --> 38:10.361
Uh, and he's going, uh,
to Philadelphia...

38:10.509 --> 38:11.863
Man, Philly's ass.

38:12.012 --> 38:13.398
Yo, you think
Allen lverson is ass?

38:13.546 --> 38:14.866
- Okay, stop.
- He only play for them.

38:15.014 --> 38:16.068
He ain't from there.

38:16.215 --> 38:17.369
Hey, I never play
for the Sixers

38:17.516 --> 38:18.836
no matter how much
they pay me.

38:18.983 --> 38:21.706
Nigga, they'd pay yo' ass
to go away. Ha ha.

38:21.854 --> 38:24.344
Enough!

38:25.690 --> 38:28.613
Okay, Andre's leaving Baltimore,
West Baltimore,

38:28.761 --> 38:30.847
traveling 60 miles per hour.

38:30.996 --> 38:33.484
He's going to Philadelphia
which is 80 miles away.

38:33.632 --> 38:34.919
What kind of car?

38:35.067 --> 38:36.355
Hey, he drivin' on l-95,

38:36.502 --> 38:37.823
he need to watch out
for the state police.

38:37.970 --> 38:39.490
They be profilin' niggas.

38:39.637 --> 38:41.859
He ain't say Andre
was black, yo.

38:42.007 --> 38:44.795
C'mon, Randy. "Andre"?
From the West Side?

38:44.944 --> 38:47.266
- Hey, he ain't say he was black.
- Yo, you know he black.

38:47.413 --> 38:49.168
Okay. Okay.

38:49.315 --> 38:51.435
I said okay!

38:51.583 --> 38:54.005
Mr. Prezbo.
You say he travelin' in a car.

38:54.153 --> 38:56.873
Is he driving? Or is he
like in the back seat?

38:57.022 --> 39:00.278
All right, you know what?
Fun is fun--

39:00.425 --> 39:02.291
Hey.

39:14.106 --> 39:15.626
Take your seats!

39:15.774 --> 39:17.662
Everybody sit down!

39:17.810 --> 39:19.243
Hey.

39:23.415 --> 39:25.315
Everything okay in here?

39:37.429 --> 39:39.850
Why isn't
Officer Massey present?

39:39.997 --> 39:42.453
Working overnight
on the wire.

39:42.601 --> 39:44.923
Attendance at all office
meetings is now mandatory.

39:45.070 --> 39:46.970
Inform her.

39:49.108 --> 39:51.763
And this Marlo Stanfield?
This is the best we can do?

39:51.910 --> 39:53.298
- Sir?
- This is the guy

39:53.446 --> 39:55.466
we're wasting months
chasing with a wiretap?

39:55.614 --> 39:57.903
We could be on the street doing
a dozen other different things.

39:58.050 --> 39:59.636
Stanfield is a comer.

39:59.785 --> 40:02.038
He's got a lot
of West Side real estate.

40:02.187 --> 40:03.640
How many bodies on him?

40:03.788 --> 40:07.077
He fought a war against
the Barksdales last year

40:07.226 --> 40:09.146
and dropped a few,
but nothing recent.

40:09.294 --> 40:10.481
Nothing recent?

40:10.629 --> 40:12.984
He owns West Baltimore
but with no bodies?

40:13.131 --> 40:15.820
Maybe it's just me,
but in 18 years out there,

40:15.968 --> 40:18.055
I have never seen
a carnivore eat a carrot.

40:18.203 --> 40:19.625
He's been quiet
for a time--

40:19.773 --> 40:22.126
"For a time"? This city's up
to its hips in blood

40:22.274 --> 40:24.329
and you are sitting on
one guy with a history?

40:24.476 --> 40:27.466
Okay, here's the new
world order, guys.

40:27.613 --> 40:29.734
I want good, quick rips.

40:29.882 --> 40:32.471
Six, 10,
12 felony cases a month.

40:32.618 --> 40:36.073
That means no more long-ass wiretaps,
no more subpoenas,

40:36.221 --> 40:37.708
no more mincing
around on shit.

40:37.855 --> 40:39.877
We get out on the street
and come back with stats.

40:40.025 --> 40:42.413
The Barksdale case
is closed,

40:42.561 --> 40:45.216
and when the Stanfield wire
comes up for another 30 days,

40:45.365 --> 40:47.318
we close out on that as well.
Understood?

40:47.465 --> 40:48.786
You know,
to hell with this.

40:48.934 --> 40:52.690
We got a wiretap up, and a judge
decides when it comes down.

40:52.839 --> 40:56.394
Well, Detective,

40:56.542 --> 40:59.204
the Deputy Ops is gonna
talk to you about that.

41:18.030 --> 41:21.185
Table B.
Put those cards away.

41:21.332 --> 41:23.597
Kareem Myers.
Sit down.

41:25.338 --> 41:27.568
Yo, yo, listen, listen.

41:29.341 --> 41:31.996
Kit Kats' $1,
Snicker bar's $1,

41:32.144 --> 41:33.932
Warheads' $1,
Twizzlers' $1.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.513
Man, Sour Patch 50¢,
and gum 50¢.

41:42.454 --> 41:44.075
Anything you can get
at the store,

41:44.223 --> 41:45.809
I can get in here
for y'all.

41:45.958 --> 41:47.912
Gummy bears?
Gummy bears?

41:48.059 --> 41:49.780
Ain't a problem.

41:49.928 --> 41:51.116
I got Snickers, M&Ms.

41:51.263 --> 41:53.651
Yo, check this price
and come holla at me.

41:53.799 --> 41:55.186
Yo, I'm runnin'
a three-for-two discount,

41:55.333 --> 41:56.519
and I'm taking personal
orders for tomorrow...

41:56.668 --> 41:58.222
I'll be here tomorrow.

41:58.370 --> 42:00.635
...so if you want something special,
just come holla at me.

42:02.674 --> 42:05.142
There it is, yo.

42:12.185 --> 42:13.671
Why not give me
a water pistol?

42:13.820 --> 42:15.840
Hey, yo, Renaldo, you just
remember about how we gonna do.

42:15.988 --> 42:18.183
It'll play.

42:31.336 --> 42:33.258
Oye, Gordo.
The package.

42:33.405 --> 42:34.726
Avanza, cabron!

42:34.874 --> 42:38.262
With that raggedy-ass piece?
Nigga, is you crazy?

42:38.410 --> 42:39.497
Loco or something?

42:39.645 --> 42:41.066
Don't you know
the shit is bulletproof?

42:41.213 --> 42:42.738
You don't understand--

42:46.818 --> 42:48.945
You heard
what the boy said.

42:57.029 --> 42:58.860
An' a box of Newports.

43:07.806 --> 43:09.794
Where my change, yo?

43:09.942 --> 43:12.103
Don't wild me.

43:22.119 --> 43:24.008
Hey, yo, you see
the look on his mug?

43:24.156 --> 43:26.817
That's the reason why
we get up every morning.

43:32.431 --> 43:36.487
Okay! Okay okay.

43:36.635 --> 43:39.825
Now, Andre's friend Yvonne

43:39.972 --> 43:42.427
is supposed to meet him
in Philadelphia.

43:42.574 --> 43:44.395
Yeah. Andre gonna
bone that skank.

43:44.543 --> 43:47.131
Can you please shut up? Mr. Prezbo
is tryin' to teach us somethin'.

43:47.279 --> 43:50.402
You shut up, bitch.
He ain't teachin' me nothin'.

43:50.549 --> 43:52.670
Yvonne, though,
is coming from New York.

43:52.818 --> 43:56.379
So my question
for you is--

44:01.325 --> 44:05.449
A, who arrived in Philly first,
Andre or Yvonne?

44:05.597 --> 44:08.498
And B,
by how much time?

44:10.034 --> 44:14.404
And C...
who gives a rat's ass?

44:16.875 --> 44:18.629
With this grant, the mandate
is not only to rethink

44:18.777 --> 44:20.332
the way we utilize institutions,

44:20.479 --> 44:23.034
but to help us start getting past
having to rely on jail

44:23.182 --> 44:26.103
and drug rehab
as our only responses.

44:26.251 --> 44:29.105
We're looking for a specific
target group to inoculate,

44:29.253 --> 44:31.008
epidemiologically speaking...

44:31.156 --> 44:33.743
Doctor, um, pardon me,
I'm not an academic.

44:33.891 --> 44:35.212
Not by a long shot.

44:35.359 --> 44:39.984
But, what exactly are you--
are you saying here?

44:40.133 --> 44:42.653
He's sayin' he's got a lot of money
to come up with some way

44:42.800 --> 44:46.090
to go at those boys out there
bangin' on the corners.

44:46.238 --> 44:47.558
That's what I mean, yes.

44:47.706 --> 44:49.760
So where do I come in?

44:49.909 --> 44:51.594
Well, if the salary
arrangements are suitable,

44:51.743 --> 44:54.765
your duties would be to
perform as a field researcher,

44:54.913 --> 44:58.236
a liaison operating
in the, uh, urban environment.

44:58.384 --> 45:00.604
You go out in the 'hood

45:00.753 --> 45:03.339
and get him some
corner boys to mess with.

45:03.488 --> 45:05.976
See? This is why
I need somebody like you

45:06.124 --> 45:07.610
to be paired up with me.

45:07.758 --> 45:08.846
I go out there
on my own--

45:08.993 --> 45:10.947
And they sell
your tenured ass for parts.

45:11.096 --> 45:12.917
In so many words.

45:13.065 --> 45:17.154
Anyway, um, we're looking
for 18- to 21-year-olds.

45:17.302 --> 45:18.856
This is where we see
the demographic peak

45:19.004 --> 45:20.791
in violent behavior.

45:20.939 --> 45:23.635
You excuse us
for a minute?

45:30.083 --> 45:31.803
What happens when you
ain't around to translate?

45:31.951 --> 45:33.737
Don't play ignorant
on me, Bunny.

45:33.885 --> 45:36.040
You can back-and-forth
with any of these guys.

45:36.189 --> 45:37.140
I've seen you work.

45:37.289 --> 45:40.311
Besides, it's clear you ain't cut out
for the private sector.

45:40.459 --> 45:42.512
18 to 21?

45:42.660 --> 45:44.515
By that age,
they're deep in the game.

45:44.662 --> 45:46.016
He's fucked on that.

45:46.164 --> 45:48.420
So show him.

45:48.567 --> 45:53.290
50,000, 80-20 health plan
and a take-home vehicle.

45:53.438 --> 45:57.760
I'd be amazed if they
give you 30, an HMO

45:57.909 --> 45:59.900
and a bus pass.

46:39.818 --> 46:40.971
Peace.
See you later.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.640
I go in there now,
you know what that makes me?

46:42.789 --> 46:46.656
Some fucking asshole politician
who's running for office.

46:49.294 --> 46:51.215
Watkins.
40th District.

46:51.362 --> 46:53.517
You call the reporters?

46:53.665 --> 46:55.930
All three channels
and "The Sun."

47:18.023 --> 47:19.410
My condolences.

47:19.558 --> 47:20.443
I'm Thomas--

47:20.592 --> 47:21.645
I know who you are.

47:21.792 --> 47:23.919
Thanks for your respects.

47:42.647 --> 47:44.435
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

47:44.583 --> 47:45.837
We shouldn't
be here today

47:45.984 --> 47:49.840
just because your son
came forward as a witness.

47:49.988 --> 47:51.340
What do you mean?

47:51.489 --> 47:53.480
I know it's...

47:55.559 --> 47:58.028
I'm just sorry for your loss.
That's all.

48:31.129 --> 48:33.149
A parent's
worst nightmare.

48:33.298 --> 48:35.853
I don't know how anybody
can go on after this.

48:36.001 --> 48:37.721
Yeah, me neither.

48:37.868 --> 48:39.790
Ms. Daniels.

48:39.938 --> 48:41.258
Councilman.

48:41.406 --> 48:43.827
How's things going over
in the 11th District?

48:43.975 --> 48:47.030
Harder than I'd hoped for.
Even on the mayor's ticket.

48:47.178 --> 48:49.333
Yeah. Eunetta's
pretty well entrenched.

48:49.481 --> 48:50.935
Good luck
with it, though.

48:51.082 --> 48:53.812
The council sure
could use you.

49:00.357 --> 49:02.513
Councilman Carcetti,
can you give us a minute?

49:02.661 --> 49:03.713
Councilman, over here.

49:03.861 --> 49:05.148
Councilman, do you mind
doing a standup?

49:05.297 --> 49:06.550
Look, guys,
I'm sorry, you know.

49:06.698 --> 49:08.285
Now's not the time.

49:08.433 --> 49:10.054
I don't really
have anything to say.

49:10.201 --> 49:12.790
- I'm sorry.
- What, is he kidding?

49:12.938 --> 49:14.458
What did we
come out here for?

49:14.606 --> 49:16.693
You don't want the press coverage?
Are you out of your mind?

49:16.842 --> 49:18.328
We'll get time on the 11 :00
from the visual alone.

49:18.477 --> 49:21.031
But I start making speeches
right here? Now?

49:21.179 --> 49:22.766
How's that
really gonna look?

49:22.914 --> 49:25.369
Boss, as political theater,
this is pretty fucking lame.

49:25.518 --> 49:28.508
Yeah, well, you know,
that depends on the audience.

49:33.057 --> 49:34.845
This is Shawn Williams.

49:34.993 --> 49:38.485
Lieutenant Mello,
please call shift commander.

49:39.596 --> 49:42.519
Boss, you want me
to stay?

49:42.667 --> 49:44.760
No. We're good.

49:50.608 --> 49:53.263
So, Shawn...

49:53.412 --> 49:55.902
You police. He ain't.

49:58.851 --> 50:00.103
Shawn, how old are you?

50:00.252 --> 50:03.618
18. How old are you,
you shinehead motherfucker?

50:06.690 --> 50:07.978
You have
a sister, Shawn?

50:08.126 --> 50:09.446
What the fuck
you want with my sister?

50:09.594 --> 50:10.913
And what the fuck's

50:11.061 --> 50:13.656
this Chuck E. Cheese-lookin'
motherfucker writing?

50:17.035 --> 50:20.356
Let's say you hear that
your sister was assaulted.

50:20.505 --> 50:22.059
Oh, who fucked
with my sister?

50:22.207 --> 50:23.393
She wasn't.
I'm just saying--

50:23.541 --> 50:24.695
Sayin' what?

50:24.844 --> 50:26.129
Why you fuckin' with my head,
motherfucker?

50:26.278 --> 50:27.997
And this bitch
is writing again.

50:28.146 --> 50:29.399
It's a habit.

50:29.547 --> 50:31.235
Now, what would you do
if you heard your sister

50:31.384 --> 50:33.011
got beat up by some guy?

50:34.019 --> 50:36.073
Which sister?
I don't know.

50:36.221 --> 50:38.075
'Cause it's Cherise,
she probably had it coming.

50:38.224 --> 50:40.409
All right,
another sister then.

50:40.557 --> 50:43.981
Danielle?
I'd fuck that guy up.

50:44.128 --> 50:46.182
I'd fuck his ass shut.

50:46.330 --> 50:47.516
With you in jail.

50:47.665 --> 50:48.784
I'd get my boy
to do it.

50:48.933 --> 50:50.087
What if you didn't
have no boy?

50:50.235 --> 50:51.755
Then I'd get the nigga
myself when I get out.

50:51.903 --> 50:53.190
Well, what if you had
a life sentence?

50:53.337 --> 50:55.058
Then I'll fuckin' escape.

50:55.205 --> 50:56.460
And put
that fuckin' pen down

50:56.608 --> 50:59.634
'fore I shove it up
your motherfuckin' ass.

51:01.446 --> 51:04.234
What if you couldn't escape,
Shawn?

51:04.382 --> 51:06.037
Fuck you.

51:06.184 --> 51:09.339
Fuck you.

51:09.486 --> 51:11.887
Would you go
to the police?

51:13.590 --> 51:15.785
Just a question.

51:21.699 --> 51:25.294
Son, thanks for being you.

51:28.773 --> 51:31.061
Thanks.

51:31.210 --> 51:34.032
Look, I'm ready
to acknowledge that, um,

51:34.180 --> 51:36.579
18-to-21 might be
too seasoned.

51:45.657 --> 51:47.877
How you fixed
for juveniles?

51:48.026 --> 51:49.813
Right now?
Fresh out.

51:49.961 --> 51:51.781
The van to baby booking
just left.

51:51.929 --> 51:53.917
But are you looking
for kids in the system?

51:54.065 --> 51:56.386
Or just kids?
'Cause if it's just kids,

51:56.534 --> 51:59.222
you got Douglass right around
the corner, and school's in this week.

51:59.370 --> 52:01.626
High school? That's what?
15 to 18, right?

52:01.774 --> 52:05.197
Yeah, but I would, uh--
I'd go younger even.

52:13.985 --> 52:16.007
Kima. 'Sup, girl?

52:16.155 --> 52:18.275
Are you sure?

52:18.424 --> 52:21.478
C'mon. I'm the one
who took you out of the Eastern,

52:21.625 --> 52:23.213
sent you to the show.

52:23.361 --> 52:26.182
You can't come back here;
you too good for a district.

52:26.330 --> 52:27.650
I need a home, major.

52:27.798 --> 52:30.619
If you need to make a move,
move up or at least lateral.

52:30.768 --> 52:33.689
But a district is
you going backwards.

52:33.838 --> 52:36.293
And you don't need to be
under my wing, either.

52:36.441 --> 52:39.196
You're gonna be valued
no matter where you land.

52:39.344 --> 52:43.133
Let me talk to people.

52:43.281 --> 52:46.269
I especially liked the timing
for when you flew your paper.

52:46.417 --> 52:48.539
Shrewd.

52:48.687 --> 52:50.341
I couldn't see anybody
shutting us down,

52:50.488 --> 52:52.976
not with the elections.

52:53.124 --> 52:54.977
What asshole would
risk the headline?

52:55.126 --> 52:58.415
But to gut us
from the inside out...

52:58.564 --> 53:01.690
Charlie Marimow.
My Trojan horse.

53:04.736 --> 53:08.792
And now, let me guess,
to save your wire,

53:08.940 --> 53:11.795
you're prepared
to go to Judge Davis.

53:11.944 --> 53:14.364
If my memory serves,
this isn't the first time

53:14.513 --> 53:16.600
a Deputy Ops felt
the need to bury you.

53:16.748 --> 53:19.216
You have a gift
for martyrdom.

53:20.686 --> 53:24.712
I wonder, though, are your
disciples as keen for the cross?

53:29.594 --> 53:31.114
In your final court report,

53:31.262 --> 53:32.915
it would be prudent
to tell the judge

53:33.063 --> 53:35.964
the investigation
hit a dead end.

53:49.013 --> 53:51.435
I doubt you'll
believe it, but...

53:51.583 --> 53:54.071
I respect the effort.

53:54.219 --> 53:57.120
You're a hell
of an investigator.

54:01.793 --> 54:03.313
It would be too much
to expect you

54:03.460 --> 54:05.258
to serve under
Lieutenant Marimow?

54:06.264 --> 54:08.184
The man's a virus.

54:08.332 --> 54:10.687
Oh.

54:10.835 --> 54:14.499
Homicide, then.
That's you, right?

54:16.941 --> 54:18.962
Yeah.

54:19.110 --> 54:22.467
I know it's hard
right now, Detective,

54:22.614 --> 54:26.414
but try to think
of this as a favor.

54:53.444 --> 54:58.168
This seems right.
Yeah.

54:58.316 --> 55:01.373
So I understand my old unit's gone
to Lieutenant Marimow.

55:01.521 --> 55:03.174
Yes, it has.

55:03.321 --> 55:04.809
So that unit is--

55:04.956 --> 55:07.844
- Yes, it is.
- That's a shame.

55:07.992 --> 55:10.780
I need to ask if you could
take care of my girl Greggs.

55:10.927 --> 55:13.283
She's a good cop
looking for a home,

55:13.431 --> 55:15.484
and I think she'd
be a natural homicide.

55:15.632 --> 55:18.625
Hmm. Well,
there was an opening.

55:20.838 --> 55:23.692
Oops. Just filled
that last night.

55:23.841 --> 55:27.864
Another fugitive
from Major Crimes, but...

55:28.012 --> 55:30.067
for you, Major?

55:30.215 --> 55:33.149
Let me see who
I don't love no more.

55:36.387 --> 55:40.977
Okay, so, if a rocket travels
say, 1,000 miles an hour,

55:41.125 --> 55:44.347
how far does it go
in an hour?

55:44.495 --> 55:46.190
Darnell.

55:52.870 --> 55:54.624
Chiquan?

55:54.772 --> 55:58.434
As far as it wants. I mean,
it's a rocket ship, right?

56:02.613 --> 56:04.301
Randy?

56:04.448 --> 56:05.634
Is this a trick question?

56:05.783 --> 56:07.637
Nope.

56:07.785 --> 56:09.473
1,000 miles?

56:09.620 --> 56:11.408
On the money.

56:11.557 --> 56:14.753
Oh, Mr. Prezbo,
I was gonna say that.

56:19.663 --> 56:21.893
Go 'head, bitch.
Laugh at me now.

56:26.169 --> 56:27.638
What? You want some?

56:30.140 --> 56:33.329
You on the fucking
floor, bitch.

56:33.478 --> 56:35.031
Laugh at me now.

56:35.179 --> 56:38.101
- Hey!
- I don't hear shit.

56:38.248 --> 56:40.136
Oh!

56:40.283 --> 56:43.541
Crystal, have the office call 911,
and get the nurse.

56:43.688 --> 56:45.657
Everybody in your seats.

56:47.792 --> 56:50.226
Just lay still.
Just lay still.

56:53.231 --> 56:54.751
Holy shit.

56:54.898 --> 56:57.920
Just keep putting
pressure on it.

56:58.069 --> 57:02.360
You're doing fine.
Chiquan, you're doing fine.

57:02.508 --> 57:04.941
Just hold on
for a couple more minutes.

57:07.512 --> 57:10.710
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
