00:14.082 --> 00:15.972
I know we've had this day
marked on the calendar

00:16.059 --> 00:18.689
for quite a while.
But it's finally here.

00:18.816 --> 00:19.871
Eeyup!

00:19.959 --> 00:20.985
Sure is!

00:21.073 --> 00:22.111
What?

00:22.199 --> 00:23.619
The Confluence.

00:23.707 --> 00:25.988
A harvest a hundred
moons in the making,

00:26.124 --> 00:28.728
when every apple comes
ripe at the same time.

00:28.816 --> 00:30.853
Big Mac's been up late
working on this schedule

00:30.941 --> 00:33.058
so we can be sure not
to miss a single tree.

00:33.146 --> 00:35.658
All it'll take now is a
few days of hard work.

00:35.746 --> 00:36.814
Who's with me?

00:40.305 --> 00:43.655
Aw.
That looks like a lot of work.

00:43.753 --> 00:46.502
Aw don't you worry
Chicka-bidee!

00:46.590 --> 00:49.439
We've got this
Confluence under control.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.340
I got us some help!

00:51.428 --> 00:52.646
That's great, Granny!

00:52.734 --> 00:54.798
Twilight and the others
are too busy at the school

00:54.886 --> 00:57.252
to lend a hoof. We could
sure use some more muscle.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.477
Who'd you get?
Braeburn? Honeycrisp?

00:59.565 --> 01:02.306
Even better!

01:08.371 --> 01:11.472
Howdy, y'all!

01:13.222 --> 01:14.785
Agh!

01:15.425 --> 01:17.915
Now that's
how you wake a pony up!

01:18.003 --> 01:20.074
Goldie Delicious!

01:20.579 --> 01:23.314
Granny told me y'all
could use a helping hoof

01:23.402 --> 01:27.246
with this here Confluence,
so I came a runnin'!

01:27.419 --> 01:29.567
Well, with a harvest this big,

01:29.654 --> 01:33.138
we're grateful for all the
help we can get. I guess.

01:33.225 --> 01:34.639
Eeyup!

01:34.879 --> 01:37.298
It's too bad y'all
ain't ever caught

01:37.386 --> 01:39.144
the Great Seedling.

01:39.231 --> 01:41.752
He'd a granted you
a perpetual harvest,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.621
Confluence or no.

01:45.237 --> 01:46.674
The Great Seedling?

01:46.762 --> 01:48.502
Well, now,
I haven't thought about

01:48.590 --> 01:50.388
that old mare's
tale for years.

01:50.475 --> 01:53.792
The Great Seedling
ain't no mare's tale.

01:53.965 --> 01:56.694
He's a magical Earth spirit,

01:56.781 --> 01:59.963
<i>all the colors of the
harvest that travels</i>

02:00.051 --> 02:04.520
<i>from farm to farm,
daring ponies to catch him.</i>

02:04.756 --> 02:08.088
<i>And those that have the
ingenuity are rewarded</i>

02:08.175 --> 02:11.676
<i>with crops that are
always in bloom!</i>

02:11.902 --> 02:14.707
And he's as real as you and me!

02:15.800 --> 02:20.369
As I'm up to recall,
Apple Bloom used to love

02:20.457 --> 02:22.322
settin' traps for
the Great Seedling

02:22.410 --> 02:24.064
when she was a young'un.

02:24.152 --> 02:26.025
- Hee hee hee!
- Hee hee hee!

02:26.113 --> 02:27.900
Well, I'm pretty
sure she's outgrown

02:27.988 --> 02:30.668
the whole thing by now.
Right, Apple Bloom?

02:32.450 --> 02:35.367
Or maybe I'm big enough
now to finally catch him!

02:35.471 --> 02:37.238

03:19.231 --> 03:21.250
Apple Bloom,
you haven't hunted for the

03:21.338 --> 03:22.781
Great Seedling since
you were little.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.616
Why would you wanna
start again now?

03:24.703 --> 03:27.999
The Confluence is so big,
he's bound to show up.

03:28.087 --> 03:30.952
And if we catch him, he'll
make all the apples ripe

03:31.040 --> 03:33.384
all the time! Right, Goldie?

03:34.087 --> 03:36.196
Mm hm. That's right,
young filly!

03:36.915 --> 03:39.929
Oh ho ho! Just imagine!
Sweet Apple Acres

03:40.017 --> 03:42.634
would be the busiest
orchard in Equestria!

03:42.860 --> 03:46.337
Now if you'll excuse
me, I've got work to do!

03:47.798 --> 03:51.048
Don't forget we have
actual work to do too!

03:51.945 --> 03:56.747
Nothing like a little filly
enjoying the harvest.

03:56.907 --> 03:58.850
I don't mind Apple
Bloom havin' fun,

03:59.001 --> 04:00.905
but there's honest-to-
goodness work to do

04:00.993 --> 04:03.621
that doesn't have a thing
to do with an old legend.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.256
Oh, quit
worrying sugarbooger.

04:06.344 --> 04:09.694
Apple Bloom can hunt for
the Seedling all she wants.

04:09.829 --> 04:12.263
If you're so
fretified about work,

04:12.415 --> 04:14.785
why don't you and your
brother get to buckin'

04:14.873 --> 04:16.406
your own selves?

04:17.495 --> 04:18.577
Granny's right.

04:20.095 --> 04:21.140
C'mon, sleepyhead.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.473
Let's get to work.

04:22.766 --> 04:25.337
Yup.

04:41.413 --> 04:42.927
And if she
had two of them,

04:43.149 --> 04:45.280
it would have been
a pair of pears!

04:46.782 --> 04:48.173
Is that right?

04:49.821 --> 04:52.366
As much as I appreciate
her volunteering,

04:52.454 --> 04:55.212
I'm not sure how much
help Goldie's gonna be.

04:55.627 --> 04:58.663
Now that reminds me
of the time Dottie...

04:58.751 --> 05:00.446
That's my cheetah,
you understand...

05:00.534 --> 05:03.077
She found out where
I keep the catnip.

05:04.769 --> 05:07.352
I love hearin' her and
Granny spinning yarns,

05:07.439 --> 05:09.754
but it looks like the
harvestin's up to us.

05:09.931 --> 05:12.415
You're gonna have to
redo that schedule.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.985
Eeyup.

05:15.167 --> 05:18.079
And as much as I'd rather
Apple Bloom were helping,

05:18.196 --> 05:20.257
I guess there's no
harm in her hunting

05:20.345 --> 05:24.181
the Great Seedling for
a day, right? Big Mac!

05:25.229 --> 05:26.476
Wh-What!

05:26.564 --> 05:27.661
Whaaaa!

05:27.826 --> 05:32.310
Gotcha! Awww. You ain't
the Great Seedling!

05:32.610 --> 05:33.945
Nope.

05:42.056 --> 05:43.569
We fell behind a bit yesterday,

05:43.657 --> 05:45.790
so we need everypony
at their best.

05:48.474 --> 05:53.649
If that's your brother's
best, we might be done for. Mm-Hmm.

05:56.962 --> 05:59.311
He was just up late
working out a new schedule

05:59.399 --> 06:00.638
so we can stay on track.

06:00.725 --> 06:03.374
I didn't sleep either!
I was too excited.

06:03.461 --> 06:06.235
I can't wait to see if I
caught the Great Seedling!

06:08.466 --> 06:10.671
I hope you're ready to
cheer Apple Bloom up

06:10.759 --> 06:12.617
when her traps come up empty.

06:12.704 --> 06:16.382
Everypony, come
quick! You gotta see!

06:18.884 --> 06:21.516
What in blazes is all
the excitement about?

06:21.604 --> 06:22.806
Look!

06:25.850 --> 06:27.929
The Great Seedling
did this, didn't he?

06:28.017 --> 06:30.306
Well, braid my mane!

06:30.394 --> 06:33.249
These sure look like Great
Seedling tracks to me!

06:33.337 --> 06:37.522
Ha! I knew it! He was here!
The Great Seedling was here!

06:37.610 --> 06:39.592
Isn't that amazing, Applejack?

06:40.335 --> 06:42.678
Yeah, amazing.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.044
Huh! Isn't it beautiful?

06:53.132 --> 06:54.965
I just can't believe
the Great Seedling

06:55.053 --> 06:56.728
was really here!

06:56.861 --> 06:58.483
Neither can I.

06:59.184 --> 07:00.932
What do you think this means?

07:01.019 --> 07:04.176
Well, it looks to
me like a challenge.

07:04.264 --> 07:07.606
The Seedling wants you
to know that he was here

07:07.694 --> 07:10.764
and he's daring
you to catch him! Mm-hmm

07:10.921 --> 07:12.786
You think I still have a chance?

07:12.874 --> 07:14.679
You're an Apple, ain't ya?

07:14.819 --> 07:17.340
Why, if you set enough traps,

07:17.428 --> 07:19.384
you're bound to catch him!

07:19.471 --> 07:22.280
You're right! And that's
just what I'm gonna do!

07:22.397 --> 07:25.629
Look out, Great
Seedling, here I come!

07:29.686 --> 07:31.796
Now why would you go and
do a thing like that?

07:32.007 --> 07:33.161
A thing like what?

07:33.249 --> 07:34.629
You know what I mean.

07:34.717 --> 07:36.442
We've got enough work
to do without you

07:36.530 --> 07:39.030
distracting Apple Bloom
by making some apple tracks

07:39.124 --> 07:41.467
and pretending the
Great Seedling did it.

07:42.014 --> 07:43.999
I did no such thing!

07:44.108 --> 07:46.270
What in the tater tarnation

07:46.358 --> 07:48.413
would make you say
a thing like that?

07:48.686 --> 07:51.598
Well, somepony did
it and she sure seems

07:51.686 --> 07:53.418
to be enjoying
this quite a lot.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.442
I'm enjoying it because
Apple Bloom's enjoying it!

07:57.530 --> 08:01.044
Uh-huh. And I suppose you
two didn't do it either?

08:01.132 --> 08:02.403
Hm. Nope.

08:02.491 --> 08:04.028
A 'course not.

08:04.115 --> 08:07.975
But I suppose it coulda
been Goldie's cats.

08:08.123 --> 08:09.842
Why don't you ask them?

08:12.108 --> 08:14.551
Have you considered
that maybe it was

08:14.639 --> 08:17.175
the Great Seedling after all?

08:17.436 --> 08:19.460
Ha ha. Very funny.

08:22.272 --> 08:25.991
I swear, sometimes I
think she's part mule.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.225
Apple Bloom?

08:33.561 --> 08:34.912
Do you know where
there's more rope?

08:34.999 --> 08:36.317
I've got a lot of
traps to make

08:36.405 --> 08:38.256
if I'm gonna catch
the Great Seedling!

08:38.508 --> 08:40.842
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

08:41.014 --> 08:42.533
I know you're excited,

08:42.620 --> 08:44.535
but we sure could
use your help today.

08:44.717 --> 08:46.286
Are you sure you
wanna spend time

08:46.374 --> 08:47.872
trying to catch
something that...

08:47.960 --> 08:49.807
might not
even be real?

08:49.928 --> 08:54.536
What? But the Great Seedling
is real. You saw the tracks!

08:54.624 --> 08:57.136
You think those appeared
all by themselves?

08:57.224 --> 08:59.129
I don't know who
made the tracks,

08:59.217 --> 09:01.387
but I don't think it
was the Great Seedling.

09:01.475 --> 09:02.944
Why not?

09:03.624 --> 09:05.653
Because the Great
Seedling is just something

09:05.741 --> 09:07.592
to make the harvest
fun for young'uns,

09:07.679 --> 09:09.208
and you're old
enough now to know

09:09.296 --> 09:12.428
that there's a time for fun
and there's a time for work.

09:12.576 --> 09:15.520
But catching the Great
Seedling is helping!

09:15.608 --> 09:18.655
He can make the trees
blossom all the time!

09:19.796 --> 09:22.067
All right. How
about this?

09:22.155 --> 09:24.098
If you help me with
the harvest today,

09:24.186 --> 09:27.053
I'll help you set traps for
the Great Seedling tonight.

09:27.141 --> 09:28.171
Deal?

09:28.405 --> 09:32.030
WOO-HOOOO! Yes,
it's a deal!

09:48.725 --> 09:52.870
Kinda looks like those
Seedling "tracks," huh?

09:53.217 --> 09:55.645
Sure, if there were
hundreds of apples

09:55.733 --> 09:57.294
in a bunch of
different lines.

09:57.382 --> 10:00.192
Well, if enough apples
fell, or got knocked down

10:00.280 --> 10:03.905
by the wind, maybe,
or animals...

10:05.428 --> 10:07.335
I'm just saying there's a lot

10:07.423 --> 10:09.529
of possible explanations.

10:09.827 --> 10:12.450
And one of them is
the Great Seedling!

10:12.538 --> 10:14.592
And the rest of 'em ain't.

10:14.679 --> 10:17.895
That ain't what you thought
when you was a foal.

10:18.358 --> 10:19.830
What does that mean?

10:20.046 --> 10:22.973
Yer sister was plum
loco about catching

10:23.061 --> 10:25.311
the Great Seedling
when she was yer age,

10:25.530 --> 10:29.538
same as you are
now. Worse, even.

10:29.727 --> 10:34.194
Oh! Is that so?
Do tell, Granny.

10:35.077 --> 10:38.911
Well, now it musta been the
last Confluence, I reckon.

10:38.999 --> 10:41.585
I was s'posed to keep
an eye on your sister,

10:41.673 --> 10:45.178
but she was slipprier
than an apple seed.

10:45.710 --> 10:48.504
Applejack! Get your
flank back here.

10:48.592 --> 10:50.928
You're s'posed to be
sorting in the barn!

10:51.139 --> 10:53.887
Sorry, Granny, I
gotta check my traps

10:53.975 --> 10:56.374
or the Great Seedling
might get away!

11:03.027 --> 11:05.288
Now, where'd I put that trap?

11:07.519 --> 11:09.139
Agh!</font>

11:09.658 --> 11:13.350
Bust my buds, where's
that young'un get to?

11:15.431 --> 11:17.613
She spent the
better half of the day

11:17.710 --> 11:19.811
<i>stuck in that trap.</i>

11:20.078 --> 11:21.926
<i>And missed out on
helping with the harvest</i>

11:22.013 --> 11:24.772
<i>because I was chasing
something for little foals.</i>

11:25.149 --> 11:27.676
<i>I felt guilty everypony
else had to work harder</i>

11:27.764 --> 11:30.562
<i>because of me, so I decided
right then and there</i>

11:30.650 --> 11:32.747
<i>I was too old to
waste any more time</i>

11:32.835 --> 11:34.257
<i>on the Great Seedling.</i>

11:35.279 --> 11:38.590
Aw, we finished the
harvest just fine,

11:38.678 --> 11:41.698
but we laughed about
that story for years.

11:44.936 --> 11:47.284
I'm still laughing!

11:47.606 --> 11:49.463
I'm sorry that
happened, Applejack,

11:49.551 --> 11:52.049
but... it won't if you and
me set traps together

11:52.137 --> 11:54.315
like you promised.
Plus we'll get 'em done

11:54.403 --> 11:57.528
twice as fast and won't miss
out on any of the harvest!

11:58.239 --> 12:00.067
Then let's get to work!

13:10.021 --> 13:13.216
It sure was fun setting up
all those traps together.

13:13.935 --> 13:15.990
I forgot what a good
time it could be.

13:16.078 --> 13:20.130
If any two ponies can catch
the Great Seedling, it's us.

13:21.845 --> 13:23.660
I can't wait to
check in the morning.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.172
Now, there's still plenty
of harvesting to do,

13:26.404 --> 13:27.956
so promise me you'll help,

13:28.044 --> 13:29.951
even if all our
traps are empty.

13:30.427 --> 13:33.308
I promise.
So long as you're ready

13:33.396 --> 13:35.308
for the bountiful harvest
The Great Seedling's

13:35.396 --> 13:37.699
gonna give us when one
of our traps nab him!

13:37.787 --> 13:38.988
Ha ha! Deal.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.860
Come on, Applejack!
If we hurry,

13:53.948 --> 13:56.839
we can check every trap and
still stay on schedule.

13:57.094 --> 13:59.331
Now that's what
I like to hear.

14:02.198 --> 14:03.315
Whoa!

14:04.193 --> 14:06.550
I don't believe it!

14:10.659 --> 14:13.315
This must've taken all night!

14:13.784 --> 14:15.276
<font color="#ffff00">Eeyup!

14:15.364 --> 14:16.393
Nothin'!

14:16.481 --> 14:17.501
Huh?

14:17.589 --> 14:20.212
I checked all the
traps near the tracks.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.378
Every one was sprung,
but they're all empty!

14:23.867 --> 14:27.479
Every trap sprung. No
way critters did this.

14:27.612 --> 14:31.495
Or the wind. I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

14:31.612 --> 14:34.259
maybe the Great Seedling
really was here!

14:39.479 --> 14:41.852
So, you're finally
ready to admit

14:41.940 --> 14:44.073
the Great Seedling
might be real?

14:44.348 --> 14:46.438
I can't think of
anything else that coulda

14:46.526 --> 14:49.870
laid out these tracks
and sprung all our traps.

14:49.986 --> 14:52.206
And if he left this
many tracks behind,

14:52.300 --> 14:54.405
he's practically
beggin' us to catch him.

14:54.643 --> 14:58.727
I ain't never seen
anything like this before.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.759
Well, tell us what you
have seen! Goldie you too.

15:01.847 --> 15:02.774
We need to know it all

15:02.862 --> 15:03.881
if we're really gonna catch him!

15:03.968 --> 15:06.329
Sure, Goldie and I will
tell you all about

15:06.417 --> 15:09.917
the Great Seedling
all day while we work!

15:10.074 --> 15:13.282
Work? Apple Bloom and I don't
have time to work today.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.454
We've gotta set up
traps in every row!

15:15.542 --> 15:17.456
Even the carrots,
just to be sure!

15:18.854 --> 15:21.227
Yesterday you said the Great
Seedling was just something

15:21.315 --> 15:23.400
to make the harvest
fun for young'uns.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.537
That was before I thought we
could actually catch him.

15:26.905 --> 15:27.929
Besides...

15:29.862 --> 15:31.641
Big Mac can make time
in the schedule for us

15:31.729 --> 15:33.277
to set traps, right?

15:33.667 --> 15:35.379
Uh... Eeyup?

15:35.729 --> 15:37.381
Great. Get to it.

15:37.468 --> 15:39.548
Apple Bloom and I are
gonna go capture us

15:39.636 --> 15:41.494
the Great Seedling!

16:20.511 --> 16:21.377
Phew!

16:21.465 --> 16:24.043
All right! Just one
more hill to go.

16:24.658 --> 16:26.449
What's wrong, Big Mac?

16:27.753 --> 16:29.019
Is this right?

16:29.107 --> 16:30.117
Eeyup.

16:30.421 --> 16:32.512
But that doesn't make
any sense.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.138
How can all these trees
be bare

16:34.225 --> 16:35.539
if we haven't
bucked 'em yet?

16:35.694 --> 16:39.202
Seems like more work of
the Great Seedling to me.

16:40.164 --> 16:41.710
How'd ya mean?

16:41.798 --> 16:44.075
The closer you get to
catchin' the critter,

16:44.163 --> 16:46.016
the more mischievous he gets.

16:46.103 --> 16:47.991
You're sayin'
the Great Seedling

16:48.079 --> 16:49.319
is taking our apples?

16:49.407 --> 16:53.655
Yes. Sounds like he's fixing
to throw you off the scent!

16:55.421 --> 16:56.793
Have you ever heard of anypony

16:56.881 --> 16:58.495
actually catching him?

16:58.582 --> 17:03.012
Oh, there are stories,
but it's hard to say for sure.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.756
He is quite the trickster.

17:04.905 --> 17:07.278
Guess that's why the
reward is so great

17:07.366 --> 17:09.155
if you can trap him.

17:11.796 --> 17:14.542
Well, his tricks have
given me an idea!

17:14.631 --> 17:16.180
Setting traps is one thing,

17:16.267 --> 17:18.184
but I reckon if we keep
watch over the trees

17:18.271 --> 17:19.374
that haven't been bucked,

17:19.474 --> 17:21.218
the Seedling won't
know what hit him.

17:21.305 --> 17:25.422
That's a great idea!
Anypony else wanna stay up with us?

17:25.592 --> 17:27.981
An old pony like me
needs her beauty rest,

17:28.069 --> 17:29.590
but you young 'uns
have a good time.

17:29.678 --> 17:31.223
My kitties can't sleep

17:31.311 --> 17:33.697
unless they're curled
up on my haunches,

17:33.784 --> 17:35.599
but I can't wait to
see the Great Seedling

17:35.686 --> 17:37.768
with my own eyes,
once you catch him!

17:38.100 --> 17:39.983
Guess it's just you and me!

17:52.203 --> 17:54.434
Too bad nopony else
wants to come out.

17:54.522 --> 17:57.077
But I'm glad we're
doing this together.

17:57.686 --> 18:00.731
Me too. It's been a
long time since I was on

18:00.819 --> 18:03.028
a real Seedling hunt,
and this is the first time

18:03.116 --> 18:04.897
doing it with my little sister.

18:06.889 --> 18:09.465
When did you start tryin' to
catch the Great Seedling?

18:09.553 --> 18:11.770
I couldn't've been
much more than a foal.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.278
I remember our parents
tuckin' Big Mac and me in

18:14.366 --> 18:16.774
and telling us all about
the Great Seedling.

18:16.888 --> 18:20.424
And I got so excited I
could barely sleep, so I...

18:23.200 --> 18:26.975
Don't you worry, sugar cube,
I won't let him get away.

18:30.374 --> 18:31.889
Whuh!

18:35.413 --> 18:37.497
Applejack! Wake up!

18:37.585 --> 18:39.096
Huh? What is it?

18:39.183 --> 18:41.116
I think a trap went off!

18:42.723 --> 18:44.623
Well, let's go check it out!

18:46.757 --> 18:48.077
See anything?

18:48.195 --> 18:49.203
Mm mm.

18:49.291 --> 18:50.691
Don't scare him off.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.211
We gotta lead him
into one of the traps.

18:54.358 --> 18:57.171
I'm not worried
about scarin' him.

19:15.927 --> 19:19.045
I think the great
seedling's hunting us! Ah!

19:19.133 --> 19:21.678
Apple Bloom? Wait!

19:29.089 --> 19:30.089
Huh?

19:31.951 --> 19:33.484
Applejack!

19:52.034 --> 19:53.604
Big Mac?

19:53.808 --> 19:56.782
He's been harvesting in
his sleep this whole time.

19:56.870 --> 19:59.790
Big Mac is the
Great Seedling?

19:59.878 --> 20:01.992
Wha! Ahhh!

20:06.128 --> 20:07.753
You OK, Big Mac?

20:08.862 --> 20:09.862
Nope.

20:14.940 --> 20:17.837
And thanks to all of Big
Mac's late-night work,

20:17.925 --> 20:20.631
we brought in the whole
harvest with time to spare!

20:20.718 --> 20:23.979
No wonder you were so
tired all the time!

20:24.104 --> 20:25.402
Eeyup!

20:25.489 --> 20:27.337
I'm glad we solved the mystery,

20:27.424 --> 20:30.431
but I really wanted to
catch the Great Seedling

20:30.519 --> 20:32.176
before I get too old to try.

20:32.263 --> 20:33.735
You know what, sugar cube?

20:33.823 --> 20:35.679
You're never too
old to be a filly.

20:35.870 --> 20:37.673
There will always be work to do,

20:37.761 --> 20:39.089
but having fun together

20:39.177 --> 20:41.479
is something you
never grow out of!

20:46.410 --> 20:50.329
Well, looks like you
don't need me anymore.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.032
Time to get home before Dottie

20:52.120 --> 20:53.649
gets in the catnip again.

20:53.737 --> 20:56.567
I have stories about
that. I tell ya what.

20:56.761 --> 20:58.869
We're real glad
you came, Goldie.

20:59.222 --> 21:01.987
Sure are! Come back next year!

21:10.034 --> 21:13.128
Looks like you forgot
to clean up the carrots.

21:13.862 --> 21:16.524
Big Mac wasn't
harvesting the carrots.

21:16.612 --> 21:18.073
Just the apples.

21:23.253 --> 21:25.227
You know what this means?

21:25.315 --> 21:27.323
Time for another hunt!

21:27.979 --> 21:29.495
Look at great seedlings.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.565
Here we go!
