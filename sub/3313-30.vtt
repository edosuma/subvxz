WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:09.629
MELISSA & JOEY WAS FILMED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.971
JUST THINK, LENNOX,

00:11.972 --> 00:14.304
NOW, THANKS TO COSTCO, WE
CAN CROSS TOILET PAPER

00:14.305 --> 00:16.847
OFF OF OUR CHECKLIST
TILL THE YEAR 2035.

00:18.599 --> 00:21.352
I KNOW, AUNT MEL, YOU DID
BUY A LOT OF FIBER BARS.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.235
- ( glass breaks )
- Ryder: OW!

00:25.236 --> 00:27.197
OKAY, YOU BETTER GO HELP RYDER
WITH THAT CASE OF LIGHT BULBS.

00:27.198 --> 00:29.779
HEY, OH, GOOD. YOU'RE HOME.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.781
- JOE, HOW ARE YOUR EYES?
- PERFECT.

00:31.782 --> 00:35.245
DAMN! I JUST BOUGHT 24
PAIRS OF READING GLASSES.

00:35.246 --> 00:36.416
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

00:36.417 --> 00:38.918
BECAUSE THEY'RE
CHEAPER BY THE CASE.

00:38.919 --> 00:41.751
AND BECAUSE I IMAGINE US
GROWING OLD TOGETHER.

00:41.752 --> 00:43.333
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:43.334 --> 00:44.834
I CAN TOP IT. YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING LATELY

00:44.835 --> 00:46.466
THAT NOW THAT WE'RE A COUPLE
I SHOULD THINK OF OUR HOUSE

00:46.467 --> 00:48.088
NOT JUST AS YOUR HOUSE,
BUT AS OUR HOUSE?

00:48.089 --> 00:49.509
AND THAT I SHOULD FEEL FREE

00:49.510 --> 00:50.930
TO PUT MY LITTLE PERSONAL
TOUCHES EVERYWHERE?

00:50.931 --> 00:52.172
YEAH, AND I MEANT IT, SWEETIE.

00:52.173 --> 00:53.513
WELL, THE UNIVERSE
MUST HAVE HEARD YOU

00:53.514 --> 00:54.724
BECAUSE YOU ARE
NOT GONNA BELIEVE

00:54.725 --> 00:56.436
WHAT MY MOM JUST SENT ME.

00:56.437 --> 00:58.888
ALL RIGHT, BABE, I
WANT YOU TO SAY HELLO

00:58.889 --> 01:01.602
TO THE NEWEST ADDITION
TO OUR LIVING ROOM.

01:04.024 --> 01:07.447
HI.

01:07.448 --> 01:08.948
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS CHAIR, RIGHT?

01:08.949 --> 01:10.069
THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.112
SURE, YEAH. AND AS I RECALL,

01:12.113 --> 01:15.155
THAT'S THE ONE SHE DIED IN.

01:15.156 --> 01:16.996
IT IS. IT IS.

01:16.997 --> 01:17.997
THIS THE VERY SPOT MY NONA TOOK

01:17.998 --> 01:19.789
HER FINAL BREATH AND
WENT TO HEAVEN,

01:19.790 --> 01:22.753
LEAVING NOTHING HERE, BUT HER..
COLD LIFELESS BODY.

01:25.005 --> 01:27.006
NOW THE CHAIR'S OURS!

01:27.007 --> 01:28.508
YOU KNOW, JOE.

01:28.509 --> 01:32.011
I REALLY DON'T DESERVE THIS.

01:32.012 --> 01:33.173
( theme music plays )

01:33.174 --> 01:35.515
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

01:35.516 --> 01:38.139
♪ WITH ME ♪

01:40.271 --> 01:41.981
SO I GUESS MY MOM
FINALLY STARTED

01:41.982 --> 01:43.643
TO DIVIDE UP ALL MY
GRANDMOTHER'S THINGS.

01:43.644 --> 01:46.316
AND IT WAS HER SPECIAL BEQUEST
THAT THIS CHAIR GO TO ME.

01:46.317 --> 01:49.609
WELL, IT CERTAINLY
IS A LARGE BEQUEST.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.191
YOU KNOW, MY GRANDMOTHER USED

01:51.192 --> 01:52.492
TO KEEP A BUNCH OF
STUFF IN THIS CHAIR.

01:52.493 --> 01:54.033
YOU KNOW, NORMAL GRANDMA
STUFF, LIKE HER...

01:54.034 --> 01:56.946
HER POKER CHIPS, AND
HER FLASK, AND, UH...

01:56.947 --> 01:59.078
YOU KNOW, HER, UH... WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:59.079 --> 02:00.911
YUP, HER SWITCH BLADE.

02:02.663 --> 02:04.954
THIS TAKES ME BACK.

02:04.955 --> 02:07.957
YOU NEVER TOLD ME. WAS YOUR
NONA A SHARK OR A JET?

02:07.958 --> 02:09.169
HEY, LOOK, I KNOW

02:09.170 --> 02:10.800
YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME
DECORATING THIS ROOM

02:10.801 --> 02:12.592
AND THE WHOLE LOOK OF IT IS...
IT'S A BIG DEAL TO YOU.

02:12.593 --> 02:13.923
OH, IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

02:13.924 --> 02:17.257
IT'S JUST LIKE A
WINDOW INTO MY SOUL.

02:17.258 --> 02:19.219
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT NOW
THAT THIS CHAIR IS IN HERE,

02:19.220 --> 02:21.521
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
IT'S MY HOME TOO NOW.

02:21.522 --> 02:23.393
I THOUGHT YOU FELT AT
HOME WHEN I ADDED THIS

02:23.394 --> 02:26.356
ADORABLE BABY PICTURE
OF YOU AND YOUR MOM.

02:26.357 --> 02:27.477
AND THAT WAS VERY NICE
OF YOU TO DO THAT,

02:27.478 --> 02:29.068
BUT LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

02:29.069 --> 02:30.069
THAT'S MY BROTHER.

02:30.070 --> 02:33.733
NO. NO, NO, NO. IT'S YOU.

02:33.734 --> 02:36.155
BUT, HONEY, THIS CHAIR HERE
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME

02:36.156 --> 02:37.697
'CAUSE, HONESTLY,

02:37.698 --> 02:39.118
THIS CHAIR IS VERY SYMBOLIC
OF OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP

02:39.119 --> 02:41.040
BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T FOR MY
GRANDMOTHER AND THIS CHAIR,

02:41.041 --> 02:42.622
YOU AND I WOULD NEVER
HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER.

02:42.623 --> 02:44.374
THAT'S WHY IT'S
SO SPECIAL TO ME.

02:44.375 --> 02:48.087
OH, WELL, IF IT'S SPECIAL TO
YOU, THEN IT'S SPECIAL TO ME.

02:48.088 --> 02:51.342
OH, YEAH, YOU CAN REALLY
SMELL THE SPECIALNESS.

02:54.215 --> 02:58.137
- READY, DUDE?
- YEAH, DUDE.

02:58.138 --> 03:00.179
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU TWO?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.262
YOU GUYS ARE
SUDDENLY BEST DUDES?

03:02.263 --> 03:04.684
I JUST NEED HIS HELP
TO MOVE SOME STUFF.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.766
AND RYDER'S THE
STRONGEST GUY YOU KNOW?

03:06.767 --> 03:07.977
SADLY, YES.

03:07.978 --> 03:09.519
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE ARTISTS

03:09.520 --> 03:11.361
SO AMONGST MY PEERS,
RYDER'S A GORILLA.

03:11.362 --> 03:13.192
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HONESTLY, I BELIEVE THAT

03:13.193 --> 03:15.194
JUDGING BY ALL THE HAIR
HE LEAVES IN THE SHOWER.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.946
LOOK, LOOK, WANT TO BE
TECHNICAL ABOUT IT,

03:16.947 --> 03:19.078
HE'S NOT HELPING ME MOVE.
HE'S HELPING JORDAN MOVE.

03:19.079 --> 03:20.910
- SHE JUST BOUGHT A NEW BED.
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

03:20.911 --> 03:23.373
YOU HAVE THOSE GIRL ROOMMATES
WITH BEDS THEY NEED MOVED.

03:23.374 --> 03:25.204
SHOULDN'T THEIR
BOYFRIENDS DO THAT?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.916
THEY DON'T HAVE BOYFRIENDS.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.207
WELL, WE SHOULD GO.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.919
WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP
THE GIRLS WAITING.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.633
OH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT. LET'S
GO LIFT SOME STUFF.

03:33.634 --> 03:35.635
WHY IS RYDER SO EXCITED
ABOUT LIFTING THINGS?

03:35.636 --> 03:37.757
I CAN'T EVEN GET HIM TO
PICK UP HIS OWN SOCKS.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.929
THEY'RE HELPING MOVE
FURNITURE FOR ZANDER'S

03:39.930 --> 03:43.052
HELPLESS AND OBVIOUSLY
MANIPULATIVE FEMALE ROOMMATES.

03:43.053 --> 03:45.184
HMM, ONE MIGHT SAY
YOU ARE DISPLAYING

03:45.185 --> 03:47.347
SOME POSSESSIVENESS ABOUT
A CERTAIN EX-BOYFRIEND

03:47.348 --> 03:49.729
WHOSE NAME BEGINS WITH ZANDER.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.851
OKAY, FOR THE RECORD,

03:51.852 --> 03:53.483
I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR HIM.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.855
I DON'T CARE WHAT HE
DOES WITH THOSE HARLOTS.

03:55.856 --> 03:58.658
"HARLOT"? THAT'S
HIGHBROW FOR SKANK.

03:58.659 --> 04:00.159
ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.412
OKAY, HE CAN GO OVER THERE
AND MOVE WHATEVER HE WANTS.

04:02.413 --> 04:03.953
I GOT SOMETHING
THAT NEEDS MOVING.

04:03.954 --> 04:06.536
IT'S IN THE LIVING ROOM. IT'S
THE COLOR OF HUMMINGBIRD VOMIT.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.498
AND IT'S ALREADY KILLED ONCE.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.870
OKAY, IF THE CHAIR
BOTHERS YOU SO MUCH,

04:10.871 --> 04:12.211
WHAT IS IT DOING OUT THERE?

04:12.212 --> 04:14.003
WELL, JOE IS VERY
ATTACHED TO IT.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.925
IT'S THE VERY SPOT WHERE
NONA WENT TO HEAVEN.

04:15.926 --> 04:17.677
( groans ) WHY COULDN'T SHE
HAVE TAKEN IT WITH HER?

04:17.678 --> 04:19.929
I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE
HEAVEN IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE

04:19.930 --> 04:22.972
AND THEY DON'T SIT AROUND
IN CRAP LIKE THAT.

04:22.973 --> 04:25.054
BUT YOU LET JOE BELIEVE
YOU WERE OKAY WITH IT?

04:25.055 --> 04:27.016
WELL, I KIND OF HALF-SMILED

04:27.017 --> 04:28.478
AND HE SAW A WHOLE SMILE.

04:28.479 --> 04:30.940
OH, SO YOU FAKED IT
AND HE BELIEVED YOU.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.153
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
I'VE FAKED IT WITH JOE.

04:35.155 --> 04:36.946
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:36.947 --> 04:38.818
WHEN I TASTED THE
SMOKED DUCK HE MADE...

04:38.819 --> 04:43.072
OKAY, "HMM, SMOKEY AND DUCKY."

04:43.073 --> 04:45.114
SO, UM, HOW ARE YOU
GONNA FAKE YOUR WAY

04:45.115 --> 04:47.076
THROUGH THAT PHOTO
SHOOT ON SUNDAY?

04:47.077 --> 04:49.208
OH, IS THAT MAGAZINE GUY
COMING HERE ON SUNDAY?!

04:49.209 --> 04:51.120
UM, THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS.

04:51.121 --> 04:53.172
IT SAYS, "'TOLEDO LIVING'
IS LOOKING FORWARD TO

04:53.173 --> 04:55.084
TAKING A PEEK INTO
COUNCILWOMAN MEL BURKE'S

04:55.085 --> 04:59.218
BEAUTIFUL HOME TO GET TO KNOW
HER UNIQUE SENSE OF STYLE."

04:59.219 --> 05:02.132
BOY, YOU KNOW THE TIMING
OF THIS IS PRETTY FUNNY.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.974
IN A SAD, UN-FUNNY WAY.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.056
UGH! THE CHAIR!

05:07.057 --> 05:08.768
HEY, I'LL GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS
IF YOU SET IT ON FIRE.

05:08.769 --> 05:10.480
OKAY, REALLY? THAT'S THE
BEST YOU CAN COME UP WITH?

05:10.481 --> 05:12.352
OKAY, 75.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.063
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK JOE

05:14.064 --> 05:15.485
IF YOU CAN MOVE IT OUT
OF THE LIVING ROOM

05:15.486 --> 05:16.566
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS?

05:16.567 --> 05:18.107
WHAT? YOU MEAN BE HONEST?

05:18.108 --> 05:19.529
YES.

05:19.530 --> 05:22.242
OKAY, I'LL TRY IT, BUT ONLY
BECAUSE I'M DESPERATE.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.907
JORDAN, YOUR BED IS ALL SET UP.

05:27.908 --> 05:30.209
YEAH, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
CALL THE FURNITURE COMPANY

05:30.210 --> 05:32.081
'CAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY
GAVE YOU WAY TOO MANY

05:32.082 --> 05:34.123
SCREWS AND BRACKETS.

05:34.124 --> 05:35.545
THANKS SO MUCH, YOU GUYS.

05:35.546 --> 05:37.667
DO YOU MIND IF WE PAY YOU
IN LAST NIGHT'S PIZZA?

05:37.668 --> 05:39.959
OH, SURE. SCORE.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.301
WOW, ZANDER,

05:42.302 --> 05:44.554
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
ACTUALLY SEEN YOU SWEAT BEFORE.

05:44.555 --> 05:46.055
IT MUST BE ALL THAT
HEAVY LIFTING.

05:46.056 --> 05:47.887
WELL, FORTUNATELY, I
HAVE AN EXTENSIVE

05:47.888 --> 05:49.348
BACKGROUND IN CONSTRUCTION.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.731
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, I BUILT
MY OWN SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE

05:51.732 --> 05:53.312
ENTIRELY OUT OF POPSICLE STICKS

05:53.313 --> 05:54.775
TO SCALE.

05:56.026 --> 05:57.897
THAT WAS COOL.

05:57.898 --> 06:00.239
SO, RYDER, WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

06:00.240 --> 06:02.862
HMM, NOT MUCH TO TELL REALLY.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.193
I'M A SENIOR THIS YEAR.

06:04.194 --> 06:06.616
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M
DOING AFTER GRADUATION.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.948
LIFE AFTER COLLEGE IS KIND
OF A VOID FOR ME TOO.

06:08.949 --> 06:10.990
GOOD THING I HAVE TWO MORE
YEARS TO FIGURE IT OUT.

06:10.991 --> 06:13.372
AH, COLLEGE... NO, NO.
I'M ACTUALLY...

06:13.373 --> 06:15.995
A SENIOR IN COLLEGE. YES!

06:15.996 --> 06:19.589
YES, AND NOT KNOWING
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS

06:19.590 --> 06:22.091
IS REALLY PART OF BEING A SENIOR

06:22.092 --> 06:23.673
IN COLLEGE,

06:23.674 --> 06:25.675
LIKE MYSELF.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.007
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY STRESSFUL
FOR MY OLDER BUDDY, RYDER.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.429
SO WHAT'S YOUR MAJOR
AGAIN, OLD-TIMER?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.220
OH, YOU KNOW.

06:31.221 --> 06:33.433
UM, POLITICAL...

06:33.434 --> 06:35.184
BIOLOGY.

06:35.185 --> 06:37.106
SOUNDS INTERESTING.

06:37.107 --> 06:39.358
SO RELIEVED YOU THINK SO.

06:39.359 --> 06:40.821
I'M A DANCER.

06:43.283 --> 06:45.695
THAT'S GREAT.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.868
I THINK I'VE USED UP ALL
THE WORDS IN MY HEAD.

06:48.869 --> 06:51.701
OH, HEY, I ALMOST FORGOT.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.082
THERE'S ONE MORE
THING IN MY BEDROOM

06:53.083 --> 06:55.955
THAT I NEED YOU TO MOVE.
DO YOU MIND, RYDER?

06:55.956 --> 06:57.877
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M
ALREADY FEELING

06:57.878 --> 06:59.299
KIND OF SORE FROM THE...

07:00.461 --> 07:02.421
UM, YEAH, NO.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.343
I'VE HEARD NOTHING
RELIEVES MUSCLE PAIN

07:04.344 --> 07:07.046
FASTER THAN HEAVY LIFTING.

07:07.047 --> 07:10.009
I LEARNED THAT IN COLLEGE
IN, UM, ADVANCED...

07:10.010 --> 07:12.262
PSYCHO... ZOOLOGY.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.402
YOU SHOULD KNOW I'M NOT LOOKING

07:23.403 --> 07:24.484
FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.737
OKAY.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.917
I CAN FIX THAT.

07:37.918 --> 07:39.289
OR IT CAN WAIT.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.926
HEY, I JUST GOT YOUR TEXT.
WHAT'S UP?

07:46.927 --> 07:48.968
YEAH, I JUST WANTED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.550
IT'S, YOU KNOW, NOT A BIG DEAL,

07:50.551 --> 07:52.391
JUST A SMALL REQUEST.

07:52.392 --> 07:54.393
I'M NOT GONNA BEAT
AROUND THE BUSH.

07:54.394 --> 07:57.857
I'M JUST GONNA COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT.

07:57.858 --> 08:00.479
WHEN'S THAT GONNA BE, EXACTLY?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.653
YOU KNOW HOW THAT GUY FROM
"TOLEDO LIVING" MAGAZINE

08:03.654 --> 08:05.024
IS GONNA COME OVER
FOR THE PHOTO SHOOT?

08:05.025 --> 08:06.776
WELL, IT'S HAPPENING
THIS SUNDAY.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.988
THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET
TO YOUR POINT BY THEN?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.610
WELL, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD USE THOSE

08:10.611 --> 08:12.612
BIG, OLD SEXY BICEPS OF YOURS

08:12.613 --> 08:16.035
AND MAYBE MOVE NONA'S
CHAIR OUT TO THE GARAGE

08:16.036 --> 08:17.206
JUST TEMPORARILY.

08:17.207 --> 08:18.207
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:18.208 --> 08:21.330
YOUR BIG, OLD SEXY BICEPS.

08:21.331 --> 08:23.122
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S
WRONG WITH THE CHAIR?

08:23.123 --> 08:25.334
NOTHING. NOTHING AT ALL.
THE CHAIR IS PERFECT.

08:25.335 --> 08:27.126
IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW,
DOES IT REALLY HAVE

08:27.127 --> 08:30.089
TO BE HERE "ALL THE TIME"?

08:30.090 --> 08:32.091
WHY DID YOU JUST AIR-QUOTE THAT?

08:32.092 --> 08:34.303
WE COULD JUST TAKE IT OUT
FOR THE PHOTO SHOOT.

08:34.304 --> 08:37.136
AND WHO KNOWS. MAYBE IT'LL BE
HAPPY OUT THERE AND WANT TO STAY.

08:37.137 --> 08:40.600
AH, OKAY. I SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

08:40.601 --> 08:43.442
YOU KNOW, YOU TALKED
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT

08:43.443 --> 08:45.565
NONA'S CHAIR WAS TO YOU,
BUT REALLY YOU WERE JUST

08:45.566 --> 08:47.987
SWALLOWING YOUR
FEELINGS LIKE, UM...

08:47.988 --> 08:49.358
OH, I DON'T KNOW. SMOKY DUCK!

08:49.359 --> 08:51.110
( gasps ) YOU KNEW?!

08:51.111 --> 08:53.032
OF COURSE I KNEW! I COULD
SEE YOU CHOKING ON MY DUCK.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.074
YOU COULD BARELY PUT
MY DUCK IN YOUR MOUTH!

08:55.075 --> 08:56.956
LOOK, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

08:56.957 --> 08:58.788
OH, YOU HATE THIS CHAIR!
YOU WANT IT OUT OF HERE.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.079
- IT'S JUST A CHAIR.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.370
IT'S A PIECE OF ME.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

09:01.371 --> 09:02.872
IT'S THE ONLY PIECE OF
ME IN THIS ENTIRE ROOM!

09:02.873 --> 09:04.333
NO, THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

09:04.334 --> 09:06.666
WE HAVE THIS LOVELY PORTRAIT
OF LITTLE BABY JOE.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.758
THAT'S MY BROTHER!

09:08.759 --> 09:11.130
JOE, THE CHAIR JUST
DOESN'T FIT HERE.

09:11.131 --> 09:12.762
YOU KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT US
BUILDING A LIFE TOGETHER,

09:12.763 --> 09:14.093
BUT YOU ONLY WANT
IT ON YOUR TERMS.

09:14.094 --> 09:15.264
- JOE.
- NO, FORGET IT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:15.265 --> 09:16.886
FINE! I'LL GET THE
CHAIR OUT OF HERE.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.938
IT'LL BE GONE BEFORE SUNDAY.
AND IN ITS PLACE

09:18.939 --> 09:20.139
WILL BE A NICE BIG EMPTY SPACE

09:20.140 --> 09:22.482
TO REMIND US OF THE GAP
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

09:24.895 --> 09:25.946
SO WE'RE GOOD?

09:33.453 --> 09:34.954
YOU KNOW, ZANDER, I JUST...

09:34.955 --> 09:36.535
I THINK YOU REALLY
MISSED WITH THIS ONE.

09:36.536 --> 09:38.197
CASSANDRA'S JUST BEEN BETRAYED.

09:38.198 --> 09:41.200
HER FACE SHOULD BE A MASK
OF SHOCK AND DISGUST.

09:41.201 --> 09:42.793
OKAY, LIKE WHAT?
CAN YOU SHOW ME?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.877
THAT'S MORE LIKE A
MASK OF CONSTIPATION.

09:49.209 --> 09:51.130
LOOK, LENNOX, I REALLY JUST DON'T
KNOW WHAT LOOK YOU'RE GOING FOR.

09:51.131 --> 09:52.131
( door opens )

09:52.132 --> 09:53.673
OH, HEY, GUYS.

09:53.674 --> 09:56.215
HEY, JOE, WHERE DID THIS
AWESOME CHAIR COME FROM?

09:56.216 --> 09:58.557
- IT'S GREAT, RIGHT?
- YES, IT'S SO COZY.

09:58.558 --> 09:59.719
IT'S LIKE SITTING IN A HUG.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.350
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
TELL SOMEONE ELSE WHO

10:01.351 --> 10:03.602
LIVES IN THIS HOUSE JUST HOW
GREAT YOU THINK THAT CHAIR IS.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.936
- YOU KNOW SOMEONE DIED IN IT?
- THEY MUST HAVE DIED HAPPY.

10:06.937 --> 10:08.688
WELL, DON'T GO FALLING
IN LOVE WITH IT, ZANDER.

10:08.689 --> 10:10.279
I'LL BE GETTING RID OF THIS
CHAIR TOMORROW MORNING.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.992
THAT'S RIGHT, THIS UNAPPRECIATED

10:12.993 --> 10:14.034
CHERISHED MEMENTO
OF MY CHILDHOOD...

10:17.367 --> 10:19.498
WELL, THE CHAIR IS GOING.
YOU MUST BE HAPPY.

10:19.499 --> 10:21.500
YOU'D THINK? NORMALLY,
I'M A BIG FAN

10:21.501 --> 10:22.832
OF GETTING WHAT I
WANT, BUT, YOU KNOW,

10:22.833 --> 10:24.834
JOE'S GUILT TRIP IS
RUINING THE WHOLE THING.

10:24.835 --> 10:26.585
RELATIONSHIPS,

10:26.586 --> 10:28.248
YOU GUYS ARE SO
LUCKY YOU BROKE UP.

10:29.549 --> 10:32.171
OH MY GOD, AM I
SITTING ON A KNIFE?!

10:32.172 --> 10:34.754
NONA WAS PRETTY GANGSTA'.

10:34.755 --> 10:37.136

10:37.137 --> 10:40.139

10:41.762 --> 10:43.893
YES, HE'S BEEN DOING
THAT NON-STOP

10:43.894 --> 10:45.394
SINCE HE HELPED YOUR
ROOMMATE MOVE HER BED.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.147
IT'S JUST CONSTANT
SINGING AND DOPEY GRINS.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.940
IT'S LIKE HE'S THE LEAD IN A
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MUSICAL.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.460
SHOCK AND DISGUST.
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

11:11.461 --> 11:14.633
OKAY, AND WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN THIS HOOKUP HAPPENED?!

11:14.634 --> 11:16.886
WELL, I WAS IN THE KITCHEN
DOING DISHES WITH CHRIS

11:16.887 --> 11:18.507
'CAUSE IT WAS MY NIGHT.

11:18.508 --> 11:21.430
ACTUALLY, IT WAS SORT
OF RYDER'S NIGHT.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.974
OKAY, THE WHOLE SITUATION
IN THAT HOUSE OF YOURS

11:24.975 --> 11:26.936
IS COMPLETELY SLEAZY:
RANDOM HOOKUPS,

11:26.937 --> 11:29.358
HOT TUB PARTIES, GIRLS
ALL OVER THE PLACE

11:29.359 --> 11:32.441
HITTING ON YOU... HIM!
HITTING ON HIM!

ZANDER, MY MAN!

11:45.705 --> 11:46.996
UP TOP!

11:46.997 --> 11:49.128
HEY, LISTEN, I GOT A
QUESTION FOR YOU.

11:49.129 --> 11:50.790
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
GET A HOLD OF JORDAN.

11:50.791 --> 11:54.713
AND SHE'S NOT RESPONDING,
SO HOW MANY TIMES AN HOUR

11:54.714 --> 11:56.505
SHOULD I BE TEXTING HER?

11:56.506 --> 11:59.598
RYDER, HAVE YOU THOUGHT
OF THE POSSIBILITY

11:59.599 --> 12:01.430
THAT MAYBE SHE'S NOT INTO YOU

12:01.431 --> 12:03.182
AS MUCH AS YOU'RE INTO HER?

12:03.183 --> 12:04.644
NO, YOU WEREN'T THERE.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.847
TRUST ME, THERE IS NO WAY

12:07.848 --> 12:09.608
THAT SHE DOES NOT
WANT ANOTHER HELPING

12:09.609 --> 12:11.730
OF RYDER LOVIN'.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.313
OH GOD, I REALLY HOPE YOU
DIDN'T TEXT HER THAT.

12:14.314 --> 12:15.614
YOU KNOW, MAN, IF I WERE YOU,

12:15.615 --> 12:17.156
I WOULD JUST MAYBE WAIT UNTIL

12:17.157 --> 12:18.657
SHE MAKES THE NEXT MOVE.

12:18.658 --> 12:22.071
I MEAN, OKAY, BUT
IT SURE IS WEIRD

12:22.072 --> 12:23.953
THAT SHE HASN'T TEXTED ME YET.

12:23.954 --> 12:26.165
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GONNA GO UPSTAIRS

12:26.166 --> 12:27.366
BECAUSE THERE'S
BETTER RECEPTION.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.169
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GO
SIT BY THE ROUTER.

12:31.171 --> 12:32.872
♪ SITTIN' BY THE ROUTER ♪

12:32.873 --> 12:35.334

12:35.335 --> 12:38.007
JORDAN'S NEVER TEXTING
HIM BACK, IS SHE?

12:38.008 --> 12:41.550
NO, SHE'S ALREADY
MOVED ON, TWICE.

12:41.551 --> 12:42.842
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

12:42.843 --> 12:44.383
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
THAT IT'S OVER,

12:44.384 --> 12:45.724
THAT YOUR ROOMMATE HAS MOVED ON

12:45.725 --> 12:47.056
TO HER NEXT DANCE PARTNER.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.268
YEAH, BUT WHEN I TELL HIM,
THERE'S GONNA BE TEARS.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.562
IF YOU DON'T TELL HIM,
THERE'S GONNA BE TEARS.

13:01.952 --> 13:04.164
( groans ) STUPID, STUPID CHAIR.

13:05.165 --> 13:07.667
( television music plays )

13:14.674 --> 13:16.755
Sofia: DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL.

13:16.756 --> 13:20.129
I'M WATCHING MY STORIES.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.051
NONA, YOU'RE HERE.

13:22.052 --> 13:26.475
( bubbly ) I MEAN, HI,
NONA, IT'S ME, TIFFANY!

13:26.476 --> 13:28.137
I KNOW IT'S YOU, MEL.

13:28.138 --> 13:31.640
I'M DEAD. I SEE EVERYTHING.

13:31.641 --> 13:33.392
OKAY, WELL, I SWEAR I WAS ONLY

13:33.393 --> 13:35.604
IN THAT HANDICAP PARKING SPACE
FOR LIKE THREE MINUTES, TOPS.

13:35.605 --> 13:36.936
OH, KNOCK IT OFF.

13:36.937 --> 13:38.817
I'VE GOT A BONE
TO PICK WITH YOU.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.819
WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT MY CHAIR?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.863
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T REALLY
GO WITH THE REST OF THE ROOM.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.946
PLUS, YOU KIND OF DIED IN IT.

13:46.947 --> 13:50.829
PEOPLE DO WORSE THINGS
TO FURNITURE EVERY DAY,

13:50.830 --> 13:52.952
ESPECIALLY IN HOTELS.

13:52.953 --> 13:57.046
NEVER... NEVER TOUCH
THE COMFORTERS. UGH!

13:57.047 --> 13:58.417
I KNEW IT.

13:58.418 --> 14:01.340
YOU MUST ACCEPT THE
CHAIR INTO YOUR HOUSE

14:01.341 --> 14:04.723
THE SAME WAY YOU
ACCEPTED MY JOEY.

14:04.724 --> 14:07.556
HAVE YOU ACCEPTED MY JOEY?

14:07.557 --> 14:09.929
I'VE DEFINITELY ACCEPTED JOE.

14:09.930 --> 14:12.022
I THINK I'VE ACCEPTED JOE.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.854
HAVE I ACCEPTED JOE?

14:15.855 --> 14:19.688
AH HA, NOW WE'RE
GETTING SOMEWHERE.

14:19.689 --> 14:22.611
THE FIRST STEP IN
ACCEPTING MY JOEY

14:22.612 --> 14:25.114
IS TO SIT IN THIS CHAIR.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.866
WELL, I CAN'T BECAUSE
YOU'RE SITTING IN IT.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.290
I'M A GHOST. WATCH THIS.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.451
- WATCH WHAT?
- BOO!

14:32.452 --> 14:33.542
( screams )

14:33.543 --> 14:36.205
( laughs ) THAT NEVER GETS OLD.

14:36.206 --> 14:39.258
NONA, HOW IS SITTING
IN YOUR CHAIR

14:39.259 --> 14:40.879
GONNA HELP ME ACCEPT JOE?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.881
( deep-pitched )
SIT IN THE CHAIR.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.215
SIT IN THE CHAIR.

14:46.216 --> 14:47.927
WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT?

14:47.928 --> 14:49.888
I'M TRYING TO SOUND
LIKE A GHOST,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.641
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY ME THOUGH.

14:52.852 --> 14:54.974
SIT IN THE DAMN CHAIR!

14:54.975 --> 14:56.856
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I'LL TRY.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.442
I CAN'T! I CAN'T! DON'T MAKE ME!

15:03.443 --> 15:06.946
OH. JOE, WAKE UP. I JUST
HAD THE WORST DREAM.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.027
AND YOU'LL HAVE MUCH WORSE

15:08.028 --> 15:09.288
IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT MY CHAIR.

15:09.289 --> 15:10.660
( screams )

15:25.845 --> 15:29.178
- HEY.
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING UP?

15:29.179 --> 15:30.599
OH, I JUST HAD THE
WORST NIGHTMARE.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.051
NONA WAS A GHOST

15:32.052 --> 15:33.722
AND SHE WAS TRYING TO FORCE
ME TO SIT IN HER CHAIR.

15:33.723 --> 15:35.054
AND THEN SHE GOT IN BED WITH ME.

15:35.055 --> 15:38.147
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT FREUD
SAYS ABOUT SEX DREAMS.

15:38.148 --> 15:40.519
OKAY, IT WAS NOT A SEX DREAM.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.152
BUT I THINK NONA MIGHT BE RIGHT.

15:43.153 --> 15:46.235
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE TOTALLY
ACCEPTED JOE INTO MY LIFE.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.617
WELL, IF SHE'S RIGHT, THEN YOU
BETTER GO SIT IN THE CHAIR.

15:48.618 --> 15:51.030
LENNOX, IF A BELOVED DEAD WOMAN
COULDN'T GET ME TO SIT IN IT,

15:51.031 --> 15:52.121
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN?

15:52.122 --> 15:54.333
OKAY, LET'S JUST TAKE YOUR WINE

15:54.334 --> 15:57.376
AND WALK EVER-SO-SLOWLY
INTO THE LIVING ROOM.

15:57.377 --> 15:58.998
COME ON, COME ON. COME ON.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.130
FOLLOW THE WINE GLASS.
FOLLOW THE WINE GLASS.

16:01.131 --> 16:04.673
ALL RIGHT, NOW, I WANT
YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES

16:04.674 --> 16:07.846
AND IMAGINE YOURSELF IN
YOUR FURNITURE HAPPY PLACE.

16:07.847 --> 16:09.298
OOH, OOH, OH,
"CRATE AND BARREL."

16:09.299 --> 16:11.590
YEAH, THEY HAVE THOSE
OAK NESTING TABLES.

16:11.591 --> 16:13.642
OKAY, IMAGINE YOURSELF
RUNNING THROUGH A FIELD

16:13.643 --> 16:15.094
OF OAK NESTING TABLES.

16:15.095 --> 16:16.555
OH, ARE THEY ON SALE?

16:16.556 --> 16:18.558
SURE.

16:21.441 --> 16:22.521
YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW.

16:22.522 --> 16:24.443
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

16:24.444 --> 16:26.065
I DID IT.

16:26.066 --> 16:28.567
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS
CHAIR ISN'T HALF BAD.

16:28.568 --> 16:30.199
IT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY COMFORTABLE.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.570
OH, AND IT RECLINES.

16:31.571 --> 16:35.164
WOW, YOU KNOW, I THINK I
CAN ACCEPT THIS CHAIR.

16:35.165 --> 16:37.206
JOE MEANS THAT MUCH TO ME.

16:37.207 --> 16:39.669
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT THIS BABY CAN DO.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.001
OH! OH NO.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.623
OKAY, JOE'S GONNA THINK
I DID THIS ON PURPOSE!

16:44.624 --> 16:46.545
NO BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HATE THE CHAIR ANYMORE.

16:46.546 --> 16:47.626
YEAH, BUT HE WON'T KNOW THAT.

16:47.627 --> 16:49.468
WELL, MAYBE JOE WON'T
KNOW IT WAS YOU.

16:49.469 --> 16:50.839
HELLO, IT'S RED WINE!

16:50.840 --> 16:53.552
I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE WRITTEN
"MEL WAS HERE" ON IT!

16:53.553 --> 16:55.224
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME
SPONGES AND SOAP.

16:55.225 --> 16:57.516
YEAH, AND A HAIR DRYER, QUICK!

16:57.517 --> 16:58.727
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON IN HERE?

16:58.728 --> 17:00.099
I CAN HEAR YOU GUYS ALL
THE WAY UP IN MY...

17:00.100 --> 17:02.231
WHAT'D YOU DO TO MY CHAIR?!
YOU RUINED IT!

17:02.232 --> 17:05.023
- NO... IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
- OH, COME ON.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.696
IT WAS. I SWEAR. I HAD
ACCEPTED THE CHAIR.

17:07.697 --> 17:09.818
I SAT IN IT VOLUNTARILY.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:09.819 --> 17:11.780
I'M GONNA TAKE THE COVER
OFF, PUT IT IN THE BATHTUB,

17:11.781 --> 17:13.572
AND I'LL SCRUB IT
TILL MY HANDS BLEED.

17:13.573 --> 17:15.414
JUST LET GO OF IT, ALL
RIGHT, YOU CHAIR KILLER.

17:15.415 --> 17:16.615
THIS THING NEEDS TO BE
PROFESSIONALLY CLEANED.

17:16.616 --> 17:18.287
WINE STAINS ARE MY SPECIALTY.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.618
I ONCE GOT WINE OFF A DOG.

17:19.619 --> 17:20.789
- MEL, JUST LET IT GO!
- NO, NO!

17:20.790 --> 17:21.581
- WOULD YOU LET... LET IT GO!
- I GOT IT.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.332
I SAID...

17:23.333 --> 17:24.333
Both: LOOK WHAT YOU DID!

17:24.334 --> 17:25.834
WHAT? YOU TUGGED IT LAST.

17:25.835 --> 17:27.256
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD UP.

17:27.257 --> 17:30.009
HOLD UP, MEL, LOOK AT THIS.

17:32.262 --> 17:35.224
OH MY GOD, THERE'S GOT TO
BE LIKE $10,000 IN HERE.

17:35.225 --> 17:36.515
AND THERE'S A NOTE.

17:36.516 --> 17:37.976
"DEAR JOEY, THERE'S
$10,000 IN HERE..."

17:37.977 --> 17:40.639
- THERE'S...
- "ALL FOR YOU.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.101
YOU WERE ALWAYS MY
FAVORITE GRANDSON

17:42.102 --> 17:43.942
AND I DIDN'T WANT ANY OF MY
LEECH RELATIVES GETTING IT.

17:43.943 --> 17:47.736
TAKE THIS MONEY AND THROW AWAY
THE UGLY CHAIR. LOVE, NONA."

17:47.737 --> 17:49.278
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
SHE MUST HAVE SEWED

17:49.279 --> 17:50.739
THE NOTE AND THE MONEY
INSIDE THE CHAIR.

17:50.740 --> 17:52.030
WELL, HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED
TO FIND THE NOTE?

17:52.031 --> 17:53.071
I DON'T KNOW. CLEARLY,
SHE DIDN'T HAVE

17:53.072 --> 17:55.194
ALL THE DETAILS WORKED OUT, HON.

17:55.195 --> 17:57.286
OR MAYBE SHE DID.

17:57.287 --> 17:59.868
YOU KNOW, NONA CAME TO ME
IN A DREAM LAST NIGHT.

17:59.869 --> 18:01.580
AND, UM, TOLD ME

18:01.581 --> 18:03.332
THAT THE ONLY WAY I COULD
ACCEPT YOU IN MY LIFE

18:03.333 --> 18:05.083
WAS TO ACCEPT HER CHAIR.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.965
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

18:06.966 --> 18:09.588
YEAH, BUT IT'S GOT MORE OOMPH
WHEN IT COMES FROM A GHOST.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.590
I SEE, SO NOW YOU'RE TAKING
ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIP ADVICE

18:11.591 --> 18:14.513
- FROM GHOSTS?
- WELL, THEY SEE EVERYTHING.

18:14.514 --> 18:16.635
YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE WAS RIGHT.

18:16.636 --> 18:21.390
I THINK THIS CHAIR
CAN STAY HERE.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.101
HONEY, I GOT TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.024
I ONLY LIKED THE CHAIR BECAUSE I
THOUGHT NONA LIKED THE CHAIR.

18:26.025 --> 18:27.687
THAT UGLY PIECE OF
CRAP HAS TO GO.

18:29.529 --> 18:31.531
I'VE NEVER LOVED YOU MORE.

18:35.785 --> 18:37.826
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
MIGHT BE UPSETTING.

18:37.827 --> 18:39.498
SO I'M JUST GONNA COME OUT
AND I'M GONNA SAY IT.

18:39.499 --> 18:40.499
JORDAN'S NOT INTO ME.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.741
IT'S ABOUT JORDAN. SHE'S NOT...

18:42.742 --> 18:44.873
OKAY.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.245
GOOD. GO... YOU KNOW WHAT MAN?

18:46.246 --> 18:47.586
I'M SO SORRY. SHE'S
JUST LIKE THAT.

18:47.587 --> 18:49.007
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

18:49.008 --> 18:50.799
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LET
YOU TWO GET INVOLVED.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.551
SO IT'S OKAY IF YOU NEED TO CRY.

18:52.552 --> 18:54.213
I WON'T JUDGE YOU.

18:54.214 --> 18:56.805
NO, NO, I DON'T... I DON'T
REALLY NEED TO CRY.

18:56.806 --> 18:58.557
LOOK, MAN, I'VE BEEN THERE.

18:58.558 --> 19:00.519
RYDER, YOUR... YOUR
FEELINGS FOR A GIRL

19:00.520 --> 19:02.140
CAN LAST LONG AFTER A
RELATIONSHIP IS OVER.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.603
YOU SAY YOU'RE FINE AND THEN

19:04.604 --> 19:06.395
EVERY TIME YOU SEE HER,

19:06.396 --> 19:08.607
YOU WORK WITH HER,
YOU FIND YOURSELF

19:08.608 --> 19:10.189
SCROLLING THROUGH ALL THE PHOTOS

19:10.190 --> 19:12.981
ON HER TIMELINE AT 1:00 AM.

19:12.982 --> 19:16.405
THAT'S... THAT'S WHEN
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE...

19:16.406 --> 19:18.777
YOU'RE NOT OVER HER.
YOU'RE NOT FINE AT ALL.

19:18.778 --> 19:20.539
YEAH, UH, LISTEN.

19:20.540 --> 19:21.950
I'VE ONLY KNOWN JORDAN
A COUPLE OF DAYS,

19:21.951 --> 19:24.583
BUT, LOOK, I PROMISE.
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

19:24.584 --> 19:25.994
- GOOD?
- HEY... HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:25.995 --> 19:27.126
YOU JUST STAY STRONG, BROTHER.

19:28.878 --> 19:30.210
STAY STRONG.

19:31.751 --> 19:33.091
OH, OKAY.

19:33.092 --> 19:34.593
I WILL.

19:34.594 --> 19:36.054
YOU KNOW WHAT? THANK YOU, BUDDY,

19:36.055 --> 19:38.797
FOR HELPING ME THROUGH
THIS ROUGH PATCH.

19:38.798 --> 19:40.389
ANY TIME, MAN, ANY TIME.

19:40.390 --> 19:41.600
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE
IT WITHOUT YOU.

19:41.601 --> 19:42.972
- MM-HMM.
- MM-HMM.

19:47.477 --> 19:49.898
HMM, BYE-BYE, CHAIR.
WE'LL MISS YOU.

19:49.899 --> 19:51.440
REALLY?

19:51.441 --> 19:54.233
WHERE AM I GONNA KEEP
MY SWITCH BLADE?

19:54.234 --> 19:55.654
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH THE MONEY?

19:55.655 --> 19:57.236
DON'T YOU MEAN "WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY?"

19:57.237 --> 19:58.237
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS, HON.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.448
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE MONEY

19:59.449 --> 20:00.659
AND WE SHOULD BOTH GET
SOMETHING FOR THE HOUSE.

20:00.660 --> 20:01.990
SOMETHING THAT WE BOTH LIKE.

20:01.991 --> 20:03.532
AWW, JOE, THAT'S SO SWEET.

20:03.533 --> 20:05.824
OH, I KNOW JUST WHAT THE
LIVING ROOM COULD USE.

20:05.825 --> 20:06.915
- WHAT?
- A BRAND-NEW

20:06.916 --> 20:08.497
ITALIAN LEATHER PURSE.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.708
AND I KNOW JUST
WHERE TO FIND IT!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.089
ITALY!

20:11.090 --> 20:12.381
I LIKE THAT, BUT YOU
KNOW WHAT I THINK

20:12.382 --> 20:14.293
WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THERE...
HOW ABOUT THIS?

20:14.294 --> 20:16.795
A MOTORCYCLE WITH TWO HELMETS.

20:16.796 --> 20:19.758
YEAH, NO.

20:19.759 --> 20:21.099
ALL RIGHT, FINE. I
HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.220
- WHAT ABOUT IF...
- I DON'T THINK SO.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.342
YOU DIDN'T EVEN HEAR
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

20:23.343 --> 20:24.553
I'M TRYING TO BE CONSIDERATE.

20:24.554 --> 20:25.554
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME

20:25.555 --> 20:26.606
BEFORE I SAY "NO" AGAIN.

20:28.688 --> 20:30.690
I SWEAR, IT'S LIKE
WE'RE ALREADY MARRIED.

20:34.774 --> 20:37.986
( chatter through television )

20:37.987 --> 20:40.158
- ( static )
- WELL, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

20:40.159 --> 20:43.121
OH, THE CABLE WENT OUT.
THE COMPANY'S SO

20:43.122 --> 20:45.414
"YOU GOT TO PAY
YOUR BILL ON TIME."

20:45.415 --> 20:47.205
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?
WATCH "AVATAR"?

20:47.206 --> 20:48.206
IT'LL LOOK GREAT ON MY PHONE.

20:48.207 --> 20:49.998
( laughs )

20:49.999 --> 20:52.581
OH, I BET WE CAN THINK OF
SOMETHING BETTER TO DO.

20:52.582 --> 20:54.834
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE THIS.

20:57.176 --> 20:58.547
OKAY, OKAY.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.839
( laughs )

21:00.840 --> 21:02.220
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.262
NOTHING... THAT WAS GREAT.
THAT WAS REALLY GREAT.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.185
IT'S JUST I DON'T THINK
THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS

21:07.186 --> 21:10.148
'CAUSE WE'RE ROOMMATES.

21:10.149 --> 21:11.890
DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR EX?

21:11.891 --> 21:14.193
NO. NO, NO.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.447
WELL, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND...

21:19.238 --> 21:21.361
YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE.

21:22.952 --> 21:25.284
I'M SO MESSED UP.
