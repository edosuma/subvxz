00:04.003 --> 00:05.665
<i>Previously on</i> The Royals...

00:05.739 --> 00:07.229
- You did!
- Admit you did it!

00:07.307 --> 00:08.365
I did it.

00:08.441 --> 00:10.568
I've been chasing this moment
for so many years.

00:11.644 --> 00:13.805
I know in my heart this
monarchy can be relevant,

00:13.880 --> 00:16.747
<i>inspiring and visionary.
I truly do.</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:19.409
<i>Too many good people
have been lost</i>

00:19.486 --> 00:20.976
<i>for us not to make things right.</i>

00:22.555 --> 00:23.988
I listened to Liam's speech.

00:24.057 --> 00:26.719
He's so clearly Simon's son.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.455
My son is going to enjoy
the same life that you have.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.895
And once I marry the King,
I'll be Queen...

00:32.799 --> 00:34.357
and you'll be irrelevant.

00:34.434 --> 00:37.267
You said you killed
my brother. Why?

00:37.337 --> 00:40.101
I was asked to take control
of a manned aircraft.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.038
I was offered a sum of money
to do it.

00:42.108 --> 00:45.009
I took the money and
I scuttled the aircraft.

00:45.078 --> 00:48.707
I never would have done what I done to
your brother if I'd known it was him.

00:50.083 --> 00:53.416
Cyrus told me to kill Alistair.

01:00.660 --> 01:03.527
- Liam!
- You tried to rob us!

01:03.596 --> 01:05.120
- You said to trust you!
- Stop!

01:05.197 --> 01:07.632
I know who killed your father!

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000

01:30.857 --> 01:32.722
T Hawk 4, can you repeat, please?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.694
<i>Joystick, I'm in a rapid
descent. Please confirm.</i>

01:37.730 --> 01:39.891
Go again, T Hawk 4.
You're breaking up.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.237
Prince Robert.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.340
Would you like to meet
your new brother and sister?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.163
Your Majesty?

02:51.905 --> 02:54.635
Your Majesty?

02:54.707 --> 02:57.540
I was thinking about the day
Liam and Eleanor were born.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.134
No one knew
we were having twins.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.043
We kept it to ourselves.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.408
Those are the secrets
we used to keep.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.100
Liam... Liam!

04:03.710 --> 04:04.972
Liam!

04:09.349 --> 04:11.010
It's not easy to watch.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.546
Show me.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.692
Before I show you this,
I want you to know something.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.198
No matter who I've been
or why I came here,

04:34.274 --> 04:36.401
I told you you can trust me,
and you can.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.177
- And so can Len.
- Princess Eleanor.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.851
I'll be right outside.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.481
Open this door! Jasper,
open the door and let me out!

05:23.556 --> 05:25.524
He trusted him!

05:25.591 --> 05:27.821
We all trusted him
and he slaughtered him! Why?

05:35.468 --> 05:37.402
Open the door! Open it!

06:06.132 --> 06:07.292
Princess?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.459
Where's Imogen?

06:08.534 --> 06:10.263
She said she had to go.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.270
Uh, she also said thank you.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.166
If you're looking for
the diamond earrings,

06:17.243 --> 06:19.268
I told her that
you would insist.

06:20.012 --> 06:22.913
Good... I would have.

06:25.618 --> 06:26.983
Do you think she'll be okay?

06:29.822 --> 06:31.949
Starting over all by herself?

06:32.191 --> 06:34.751
Are we speaking about Imogen
or a princess?

06:35.895 --> 06:38.125
Imogen, of course.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.722
I think she'll be just fine.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.859
She's strong.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.698
This world can't beat her.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.673
If you've come to eat him,
he hasn't been born yet.

06:56.816 --> 07:00.081
Are you really going to have the baby
and his mother sleeping in your room?

07:00.153 --> 07:03.316
Just the baby.
And possibly a sexy au pair.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.118
The mother can fend for herself.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.557
You mean the Queen.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.686
I didn't plan it like this.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.662
And what about your cancer?

07:11.731 --> 07:14.598
How soon will we have to bow
to the little son-of-a-maid?

07:14.667 --> 07:18.159
Look, whatever plot or ruse
or conspiracy you're crafting...

07:18.237 --> 07:20.535
I'm not.
I'm done with all that.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.598
I just came to...
bring you this.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.704
It was Robert's.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.008
He loved it more than
life itself.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.810
I hope our new king
loves it as much as he did.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.748
I won't be attending
the King's Cup.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.652
I've got another engagement.

07:36.722 --> 07:38.747
- What engagement?
- I'm getting married.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.225
Right here.
Have to make things official.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.693
Shame you can't attend.

07:42.762 --> 07:45.890
I'd rather attend an execution.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.024
In many ways, one and the same.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.031
Do you really expect me to believe
you're going to accept all this

07:54.106 --> 07:55.767
without a fight?

07:55.842 --> 07:59.573
Becoming the Dowager Queen,
deferring to my legacy?

08:00.746 --> 08:02.873
Fighting got me nowhere.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.610
Rather, it got me here.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.212
To this place.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.914
One and the same.

08:27.306 --> 08:28.705
Going somewhere?

08:28.774 --> 08:30.537
To New York.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.270
To see Ophelia.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.642
Children shouldn't have to
pay for their parents' sins.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.707
What?

08:39.784 --> 08:43.015
For a moment I thought
I saw the man I married.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.750
The man I loved.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.394
Father trusted him.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.766
He told me I could turn to
him if I needed anything.

09:00.506 --> 09:01.996
Like a father figure.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.373
Yeah. Me too.

09:06.746 --> 09:10.204
If we go to the authorities
and they make a mistake,

09:10.283 --> 09:11.910
he could disappear forever.

09:13.419 --> 09:16.081
- I promised my father justice.
- I know you did.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.025
We need to be smart about this.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.365
We need a plan.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.433
And I have one.

10:02.401 --> 10:03.732
You found it.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.997
And now someone has to tell her.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.043
I'm thinking about repainting
that wall.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.472
Starting over like Imogen.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.580
I love you. You know that?

10:21.721 --> 10:23.552
Why? What happened?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.716
Stop! What?

10:26.559 --> 10:29.528
Dad's killer. It was Ted.

10:30.429 --> 10:33.364
- Ophelia's father? Ted?
- Yeah.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.758
Len...

10:37.303 --> 10:40.033
- Come on. It's OK.
- Let me go!

10:42.508 --> 10:44.100
How? Why?

10:44.176 --> 10:46.474
I don't know why.
But he'll pay for this.

10:46.545 --> 10:49.343
- We're coming up with a plan.
- Who's "we"? Is James involved?

10:49.415 --> 10:50.507
Jasper.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.474
I know you have trust issues.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.952
I know people have failed
you, including Jasper.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.718
But he wouldn't stop until he
found the truth. And he did.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.782
We'll make this right, Len.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.626
And then what?
Once all this is over?

11:04.697 --> 11:06.722
Who's going to be left, Liam?

11:08.367 --> 11:10.562
We will. You and me.

11:12.571 --> 11:15.870
- They don't get rid of us.
- We get rid of them.

11:23.783 --> 11:27.617
- The King's Cup.
- A football match?

11:27.687 --> 11:31.179
The first annual football
match dedicated to the late,

11:31.257 --> 11:34.124
thanks to you,
King Simon Henstridge.

11:37.563 --> 11:41.431
20,000 spectators.
Pre-disposed to violence.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.298
Especially considering
our current royal climate.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.568
Millions more
watching from home.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.767
A video tribute
to the late King.

11:49.842 --> 11:52.538
A speech made by the Queen
herself.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.341
We'll display
our own presentation,

11:57.416 --> 11:58.849
commemorating this...

11:58.918 --> 12:02.285
<i>- You killed her, didn't you?
- I did it.</i>

12:02.354 --> 12:04.948
They'll finally be accountable for
your sister's death.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.514
Wait. There's more.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.722
The Queen smoking a joint.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.095
The King doing blow.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.157
And so many other
wonderful moments

12:16.235 --> 12:18.795
from our inspiring and noble
royal family.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.001
They may not make it out alive.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.101
I'll be tried for treason.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.043
Better than being tried
for murder.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.412
It's revenge.

12:36.188 --> 12:39.351
I once asked Dominique if it's justice
her father wanted or revenge.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.060
We just got our answer.

12:42.695 --> 12:43.889
What kind of revenge?

12:43.963 --> 12:46.591
They have footage from the
palace. Hidden camera stuff.

12:46.665 --> 12:48.064
Courtesy of Ted Pryce?

12:48.134 --> 12:50.466
They plan to show it tomorrow
at the football match.

12:50.536 --> 12:53.334
They want to disgrace you
at an event to honor your father.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.306
Dominique says she heard
them talking about Robert.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.275
It was Ted who had him killed.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.612
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.947
- She said that?
- She's getting out.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.714
She doesn't want any part of it.

13:09.655 --> 13:10.747
It's why she told me.

13:10.823 --> 13:11.983
- And you believe her?
- I do.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.083
- We should cancel the event.
- No!

13:15.895 --> 13:17.192
They'll just keep going.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.128
It'll never stop
unless we stop it.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.223
- Meaning what?
- Ted.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.028
- We need to end this.
- You mean kill him.

13:25.104 --> 13:28.505
Liam, you're talking about
taking a man's life.

13:28.574 --> 13:31.941
Even if it's justified, you
can't come back from that. Ever.

13:32.011 --> 13:35.208
Ted Pryce killed my father
and my brother with malice in his heart.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.842
Get me close enough to that sonofabitch,
I'll kill him myself.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.482
Your Majesty.

13:46.559 --> 13:49.426
What does Team Helena want now?

13:49.495 --> 13:52.020
Team Helena has been defeated.

13:54.366 --> 13:56.163
And with Lucius gone,

13:56.235 --> 14:01.229
I thought maybe Team Cyrus
may need my particular set of skills.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.577
All of them.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.493
Moorefield?

14:26.565 --> 14:27.998
You scared the shit out of me.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.432
I'm hiding from the
princesses. The jig is up.

14:33.239 --> 14:34.501
The what?

14:34.573 --> 14:37.098
The ruse. The scheme.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.376
They know I've been seeing them both.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.243
Well, you can stand down.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.305
Cyrus is expecting a son

14:44.383 --> 14:47.284
and plans to reinstate
the right of primogeniture.

14:47.353 --> 14:48.718
Stand down?

14:48.787 --> 14:52.018
His first born son is going
to inherit everything.

14:53.025 --> 14:57.724
The jig, as you say,
is now officially up.

15:13.512 --> 15:14.570
Hi.

15:16.382 --> 15:18.907
Just say it. Then you can go.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.920
I like Maribel.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.250
It's OK.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.622
I can't blame you, I'm apparently no
longer the future Queen of England

15:27.693 --> 15:30.628
and she does like anything
with boys and... sometimes with girls.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.290
I like Maribel.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.698
But I don't have feelings for her.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.102
I have feelings for you.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.137
Oh...

15:43.175 --> 15:44.802
And as an anti-monarchist,

15:46.812 --> 15:50.407
you are so much lovelier now that you
are not the next in line for the throne.

15:51.417 --> 15:54.716
So, you, uh,
you want to get out of here?

15:55.721 --> 15:57.848
Okay.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.624
Thank you.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.629
There she is. My beloved.

16:10.703 --> 16:14.070
Does this look like the day
you dreamed about as a little girl?

16:14.139 --> 16:16.937
You mean the day
I would marry Brad Pitt?

16:17.810 --> 16:21.143
No. This doesn't look
like that at all.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.242
The minister will be here shortly.

16:25.884 --> 16:29.149
Good. Then we have time
for you to sign this.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.155
What's this?

16:31.223 --> 16:34.192
Just a few things I'm going to need
to make this marriage work.

16:34.259 --> 16:37.387
Nothing says true love like
a wife who blackmails you.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.739
As always, your discretion
is appreciated, doctor.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.602
Ah. My daughter's
security detail.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.337
What is it?

16:55.414 --> 16:57.746
The crowd for tomorrow's
match could be volatile.

16:57.816 --> 17:02.844
The people who support the monarchy are
clashing with the ones... that don't.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.411
I bet they are.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.624
What else?

17:07.693 --> 17:10.355
Your Majesty...
should watch this.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.089
And then we should speak.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.132
In confidence.

17:50.369 --> 17:53.998
A love born in trust
and faithfulness.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.804
Do you, Cyrus Henstridge, take this...

17:57.876 --> 18:01.471
I do. Wrap it up, Padre.
I want to consummate this bitch.

18:01.547 --> 18:04.175
- By the power vested in me...
- By me...

18:04.850 --> 18:07.614
...um, I now pronounce you
man and wife.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.620
You may kiss the bride.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.685
Go ahead and turn away.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.752
But much worse things are going

18:18.831 --> 18:21.595
to happen to that mouth of yours,
as you know.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.259
I'm going home to pack
my things.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.700
No. You're staying here.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.637
From now on, whatever
you need will be provided.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.401
So make yourself comfortable.

18:29.475 --> 18:33.036
And while you're at it, you might try
spitting out the future King of England.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.082
You got what you wanted.
Now hurry up and earn it!

18:48.393 --> 18:50.827
Apparently Ted planted hidden
cameras in the palace.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.830
And now they have us
at our worst.

18:52.898 --> 18:54.160
Speaking of cameras...

18:54.233 --> 18:56.701
It's fine. I looped the feed
in this zone when I...

18:57.069 --> 18:59.629
Oh, when he tried to rob me.

19:01.106 --> 19:03.165
The video hack will be easy
enough to block.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.870
That won't stop him
broadcasting the footage elsewhere.

19:05.944 --> 19:10.142
Like social media. Why hasn't he already
done that? What's he waiting for?

19:10.682 --> 19:12.274
Us.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.114
Oh, great!

19:14.186 --> 19:16.518
Some security detail
you two are.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.317
I invited Her Majesty.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.657
Mr. Stewart wants to
publicly humiliate us,

19:22.728 --> 19:25.196
create chaos and use it
to his advantage.

19:25.330 --> 19:30.529
Fine. If they want
a public tribunal, let's give them one.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.229
What are we doing about
Ted Pryce?

19:32.304 --> 19:33.532
We need to keep him close.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.902
But whoever does it
will be in jeopardy.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.635
He's a psychopath
and will be armed.

19:37.709 --> 19:41.304
- I'll do it.
- No. I'll do it.

19:42.714 --> 19:43.772
What else?

19:43.949 --> 19:46.247
We need complete access to
the stadium.

19:46.385 --> 19:49.115
We are the royal family.
Who has more access than us?

20:20.852 --> 20:22.046
What kind of sick joke...

20:22.120 --> 20:25.681
<i>You don't know
anything about anything, Mr. Pryce.</i>

20:25.757 --> 20:30.524
<i>Do you understand that now? You are
not safe. You are not comfortable.</i>

20:30.596 --> 20:33.497
<i>You're certainly not
absolved of your sins.</i>

20:33.565 --> 20:37.126
<i>You will go to that stadium,
you will monitor that family,</i>

20:37.202 --> 20:40.638
<i>and if anything goes wrong,
you will personally execute them.</i>

20:40.706 --> 20:43.675
<i>That's not asking too much,
considering your history.</i>

20:47.279 --> 20:49.645
After tomorrow, I want out.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.945
<i>There's no way out of this, Ted</i>.

20:52.017 --> 20:54.918
<i>You made your pact with
the Devil a long time ago.</i>

20:54.987 --> 20:58.718
<i>Deviate from this plan, and I'll be
on the first flight to New York.</i>

20:59.491 --> 21:02.392
<i>You see, I can kill
family members too.</i>

21:13.972 --> 21:15.963
Hm. Have a seat. Drink?

21:16.642 --> 21:18.007
- No.
- Of course.

21:28.153 --> 21:29.882
I want to talk to you about Ted.

21:30.656 --> 21:33.352
When he lost his wife,
when he was grieving,

21:34.326 --> 21:36.886
- I may have provoked him.
- That's not true.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.759
I was incredibly
inconsiderate and unkind to him.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.294
You're incredibly
inconsiderate and unkind to me

21:45.370 --> 21:46.735
and I didn't kill anyone.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.134
Can you just let me apologize
for something for a moment? Please?

21:54.846 --> 21:56.905
I was frivolous
with that man's grief.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.276
And I've been sitting here,

22:01.586 --> 22:05.784
drinking... and feeling like
I'm to blame...

22:06.958 --> 22:10.052
...for the loss of your father
and your brother.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.129
You were just a dick, Mom.

22:14.199 --> 22:16.099
The guy's a modern-day
Jack the Ripper.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.363
- Or Grand Duchess.
- Exactly.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.662
You just said some words, Mom.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.766
I'd rather you shout at me than stab me
twice and leave me for dead.

22:25.977 --> 22:29.037
I'm with Liam.
It's not your fault.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.775
Thank you.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.345
There's something else.

22:35.420 --> 22:39.618
Tomorrow, if we fail
and they succeed,

22:39.691 --> 22:41.488
remember that I love you.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.119
Because I do.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.857
We know that, Mom.

22:46.798 --> 22:50.325
And we won't... fail.

22:54.573 --> 22:57.804
Get some sleep.
Maybe don't drink so much.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.909
Yes, I just said that.

23:05.517 --> 23:07.178
Mom...

23:08.387 --> 23:11.584
When you get in the car with
Ted, don't be nice to him.

23:11.656 --> 23:14.591
If you are, he'll know
something's wrong.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.930
I wrote the book on deception
and facade, my son.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.398
- I think I'll be fine.
- OK. 12 o'clock.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.431
Liam?

23:27.406 --> 23:31.740
I know you miss your father, but...
this is the right way to do this.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.471
Yeah.

23:34.346 --> 23:35.608
I know.

23:47.626 --> 23:49.287
It's time.

23:52.297 --> 23:53.958
It's time.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.083
I never got to say thank you before.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.457
For what?

24:24.529 --> 24:27.327
Finding the evidence.
Not giving up.

24:30.902 --> 24:33.837
I just want to make sure you're okay
with everything for tomorrow.

24:39.444 --> 24:44.677
If their plan works,
one of us could die tomorrow.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.885
And if our plan works,
I'm officially in the family business.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.420
I want to avenge my father.

24:54.426 --> 24:56.087
I want Ted to pay.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.821
But if we do this,
they could kill him.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.091
I don't know if
I can go through with it.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.762
I don't know if I could live
with that.

25:06.838 --> 25:10.001
I'll be there. With you.

25:15.313 --> 25:17.747
I appreciate
what you've done for us.

25:20.051 --> 25:21.985
But once this is all over,

25:23.154 --> 25:25.213
I need you to leave
and not come back.

25:27.826 --> 25:29.487
I can't see you any more.

25:32.163 --> 25:33.824
It's too hard.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.963
Okay.

25:41.239 --> 25:42.900
Okay.

26:24.549 --> 26:27.746
Your father was a man
who believed in the truth.

26:28.486 --> 26:30.454
He'd want you to know the truth.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.517
And son, I'm always here
if you need me.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.266
<i>That's it.
You're doing so well.</i>

26:47.339 --> 26:49.170
Now just take
a nice deep breath.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.835
In through your nose.

26:52.911 --> 26:57.143
Okay, breathe. Well done.

26:57.215 --> 27:00.616
Liam? It's time.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.913
Liam?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.488
We have a situation.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.975
Liam.
What are you doing here?

27:26.811 --> 27:28.301
There's been a change of plans.

27:34.719 --> 27:35.879
Big day.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.950
Your father would have been proud.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.061
Why did you do it, Ted?

27:50.235 --> 27:51.862
- Look...
- Don't move.

27:51.936 --> 27:54.200
- Liam, whatever you think you know...
- I saw you!

27:57.609 --> 28:00.874
Have you asked yourself
what happens after this,

28:00.945 --> 28:02.537
after you pull that trigger?

28:02.614 --> 28:04.377
My family's avenged.

28:04.449 --> 28:06.076
What about you?

28:06.151 --> 28:09.245
I consider this justified.

28:12.424 --> 28:15.052
If I don't answer it, they'll
go after Ophelia. There's a protocol.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.561
Okay?

28:24.903 --> 28:26.871
Hello.

28:28.306 --> 28:30.001
One moment.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.037
It's for you.

28:44.155 --> 28:49.183
- Who is this?
- Liam. Please do not do this.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.820
<i>I know you're in pain and
I know that you want revenge,</i>

28:52.897 --> 28:54.387
<i>but you don't want it like this.</i>

28:55.433 --> 28:57.594
<i>There's something happening, Liam</i>.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.967
<i>The people, they believe
in you. Don't you see it?</i>

29:00.505 --> 29:03.633
This is exactly what
Dad wanted all along.

29:03.708 --> 29:06.609
<i>It's who you thought
you couldn't be for him,</i>

29:06.678 --> 29:07.804
<i>and for the world</i>.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.814
<i>But if you do this, Liam,
if you pull that trigger,</i>

29:10.882 --> 29:13.578
<i>that is when you are really
failing Dad.</i>

29:13.651 --> 29:16.142
<i>And that's when we all lose you.</i>

29:16.221 --> 29:18.348
<i>And I can't afford to lose
you, Liam. I can't.</i>

29:19.691 --> 29:21.750
<i>Please!</i>

29:21.826 --> 29:23.418
<i>Say you won't do this</i>.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.895
<i>Tell me you'll lead us all
out of this, okay?</i>

29:26.698 --> 29:29.599
<i>Liam? Okay?</i>

29:31.035 --> 29:32.195
Okay.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.696
The car's waiting.
We need to go.

29:47.085 --> 29:50.646
You will find that taking a
life is an unbearable weight.

29:51.823 --> 29:53.950
Every second. Every minute.

29:54.025 --> 29:56.550
Every hour, every day,

29:56.628 --> 29:59.426
a constant reminder of
what you did

29:59.497 --> 30:01.829
and how you did it.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.993
You can't hide from it.

30:04.068 --> 30:06.662
You can't erase it.

30:06.738 --> 30:09.138
And you can't take it back.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.342
Use mine.

30:19.651 --> 30:23.747
Tell them there was a struggle.
Call it an act of self-defense.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.689
It's just a lie.
We all live with them.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.660
You asked me why I did
the things I've done.

30:38.203 --> 30:43.004
I'll tell you. You know that fire,
that hatred you feel?

30:43.708 --> 30:47.576
The one fed by anger and
vengeance and retribution?

30:47.645 --> 30:51.342
I called it justice.
But it wasn't.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.077
It was merely retaliation.

30:54.252 --> 30:58.120
And that fire never goes out,
no matter what.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.180
It just consumes you.

31:02.227 --> 31:04.252
It just burns you up.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.786
A video is going to play
during your father's dedication

31:34.859 --> 31:37.623
that documents Dominique
Stewart's death

31:37.695 --> 31:40.823
and the many other sins
of your house.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.665
So from where I'm sitting,
you have two choices

31:44.736 --> 31:46.704
and they're both fairly grim.

31:47.972 --> 31:52.375
You either pull the trigger
and be judged for it,

31:53.311 --> 31:55.575
or you step outside this vehicle

31:55.647 --> 31:57.911
and face the world
as that video plays.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.078
There's a third option.

32:02.153 --> 32:03.848
You're not the only one
with a video.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.620
Interesting.

32:10.695 --> 32:11.992
But if you fail...

32:12.063 --> 32:14.463
You should be more concerned
with the alternative.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.061
What becomes of you if I don't?

32:19.771 --> 32:21.898
And the world sees
what you've done?

32:21.973 --> 32:24.533
But you can't be certain
of that, can you?

32:25.209 --> 32:29.475
You step out there, the chances are
pretty good that you'll be accountable

32:29.547 --> 32:31.105
for what your family's done.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.351
Someone has to be.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.461
I love you, Liam!

32:54.806 --> 32:58.902
Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you.
Princess coming through.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.685
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:15.760 --> 33:21.699
please show your support for His Royal
Highness, Prince Liam Henstridge!

33:36.047 --> 33:38.914
Geez, Rambo. Did you kill
the poor schlub?

33:38.983 --> 33:40.575
Maybe.

33:50.294 --> 33:53.559
- Hurry up. We're running out of time.
- Very helpful, thank you.

34:09.947 --> 34:14.110
And now, a dedication
to King Simon from his son,

34:14.185 --> 34:17.052
His Royal Highness,
Prince Liam Henstridge.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.188
Time's up, son.

34:26.464 --> 34:27.931
Don't call me son.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.283
We're in.

34:50.487 --> 34:53.081
We push this button and the
world will know Ted did it.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.517
I'll do it.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.823
I can do it.

34:58.896 --> 35:00.864
What you see of our family...

35:02.767 --> 35:05.065
...is pretty much what we allow
you to see.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.903
But I promise you,
what you're about to see is the truth.

35:12.243 --> 35:13.904
On my father's grave.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.749
You should go.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.292
After him!
He's getting away!

36:39.363 --> 36:41.024
Tell Ophelia not to miss me.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.392
Ssh. Ssh.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.890
Ssh.

37:50.968 --> 37:52.936
Oh-ho.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.699
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.535
You need to see this.

37:57.808 --> 38:01.904
Ssh.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.413
<i>Police are struggling
to contain the violence</i>

38:04.482 --> 38:08.282
<i>after CCTV footage showing
the late King Simon's killing</i>

38:08.352 --> 38:11.150
<i>was somehow broadcast over
the stadium's screens.</i>

38:11.889 --> 38:15.916
<i>A man believed to be associated
with the Palace's own security forces</i>

38:15.993 --> 38:17.221
<i>has been attacked</i>.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.229
<i>Reinforcements are being</i>...

38:19.297 --> 38:22.960
Announce the birth of my son.
Maybe that will appease them.

38:23.034 --> 38:25.002
Yes, Your Majesty.

38:25.069 --> 38:27.367
So it was Pryce!

38:28.205 --> 38:29.866
Figures.

38:35.279 --> 38:37.440
Did he finally stop crying?

38:40.318 --> 38:41.615
Prudence!

38:45.756 --> 38:47.417
Prudence!

38:47.992 --> 38:49.084
Prudence!

38:51.095 --> 38:52.653
Prudence!

38:56.901 --> 38:58.163
Prudence?

39:01.505 --> 39:04.770
Prudence is gone.
And so is her child.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.640
I married her!
You're no longer Queen!

39:08.646 --> 39:11.240
The man who married you
was my gynecologist.

39:11.315 --> 39:13.545
Rachel had them switched.

39:14.218 --> 39:15.515
Team Helena.

39:15.586 --> 39:17.213
But you can't just kidnap her!

39:17.288 --> 39:20.951
Oh, I can assure you,
she went quite willingly.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.756
But the pre-nup
agreement! She wanted this!

39:24.829 --> 39:26.990
The pre-nup agreement
was Prudence's idea,

39:27.064 --> 39:31.433
designed to lower
your guard. Clever girl.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.342
Also... Team Helena.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.941
You manipulated her!

39:41.011 --> 39:45.675
You said you were done fighting back,
and then you take my son?

39:45.750 --> 39:48.810
Why would you do that?
In the name of what?

39:49.720 --> 39:51.551
Alistair Lacey.

39:54.992 --> 39:58.792
You take away my future.
I take away yours.

40:00.264 --> 40:01.856
Enjoy cancer.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.341
Well done with Cyrus, Rachel.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.284
My pleasure, Your Majesty.

41:31.255 --> 41:32.586
Now, then...

41:32.656 --> 41:35.454
My son is the rightful heir
to the throne

41:35.526 --> 41:37.255
and Simon's DNA will prove it.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.657
Let's make things right.

41:42.466 --> 41:44.457
Get me those bones.

42:53.500 --> 43:01.500
