01:59.077 --> 02:00.245
Who's there?

02:00.746 --> 02:02.831
-Raymond.
-"Raymond" who?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.001
How many Raymonds do you know, Ray?

02:11.924 --> 02:13.217
Our father is dead.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.181
By his own hand?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.893
No, not by his own--
He was sick, for Chrissake.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.270
Can I come in?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.951
Put the gun away, Ray.
You know I don't like guns.

02:39.034 --> 02:42.162
Then you shouldn't knock on people's doors
in the middle of the night.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.915
Well, I tried to call,
but your phone was dead.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.208
I'm behind on bills.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.794
You want something to drink?

02:49.628 --> 02:50.629
Coffee.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.713
Coffee.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.719
When was I last here? Three years?

02:58.303 --> 03:00.097
After Athena's surgery.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.515
That'd be five.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.725
Really? Shit.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.314
So, who called you about the old man?

03:09.898 --> 03:11.733
I mean, who even talks to him anymore?

03:11.817 --> 03:13.694
Reverend West, his pastor.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.781
Harris has a pastor? Are you shitting me?

03:18.866 --> 03:21.827
Yeah. His last wish was
that his sons attend his funeral.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.706
It's tomorrow, Ray. Outside of Richmond.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.293
You don't have to go.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.462
He's dead. He'll never know.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.926
You're a very tender man, you know that?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.097
So what's your plan?

03:42.598 --> 03:48.228
I'll leave early, before dawn,
but, I can't alone.

03:48.312 --> 03:51.023
I don't have a license, Ray.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.193
I got a DUI.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.944
I had two beers.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.905
The first time I've been pulled over
in 20 years.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.990
I had to drive here tonight
'cause I couldn't reach you,

04:00.073 --> 04:02.743
but if I get stopped,
I could be in deep shit.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.620
Why doesn't your wife just drive you?

04:08.165 --> 04:09.541
We're on the rocks.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.462
She left me in December.

04:15.839 --> 04:16.923
Ho, ho, ho.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.224
Why did you say "by his own hand" before?

04:25.307 --> 04:26.642
Why would he kill himself?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.520
I guess I just always thought he would.

04:32.231 --> 04:35.859
Such a bitter son of a bitch. Frustrated.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.863
Everything he touched turned to shit.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.157
Just thought he'd put himself to sleep
one day.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.789
I fantasized about it my whole childhood,

04:49.957 --> 04:53.752
him putting a gun in his mouth
and blowing off the top of his head.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.712
Jesus.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.591
You're really gonna go?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.136
After the things he did to you?

05:12.354 --> 05:14.314
You still working at the plant?

05:14.398 --> 05:16.859
No. Fired.

05:17.693 --> 05:18.694
For what?

05:19.194 --> 05:21.864
I don't know. Some altercation.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.157
"Altercation"? Fancy.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.870
If I asked the other guy,
would he use that word?

05:28.203 --> 05:30.998
It's difficult for him to speak
with no teeth and all.

05:32.708 --> 05:33.792
What was it about?

05:34.960 --> 05:35.961
Nothing.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.212
What was it about, Ray?

05:41.008 --> 05:44.011
He used the N-word.
I told him not to. It escalated.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.221
What are you doing for work now?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.056
Construction. Here and there.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.516
I have two days this week,

05:50.017 --> 05:52.269
which is another great reason
to skip a funeral.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.860
I saw a woman leaving earlier.
She a keeper?

06:03.447 --> 06:04.907
You playing any gigs?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.950
Nah, I haven't played a gig in forever.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.536
Why not? You're sounding good.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.621
I don't play anymore.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.372
I heard you
when I was knocking on the door.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.749
-No.
-I heard it.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.668
I don't have any horns anymore. Sold 'em.

06:17.878 --> 06:18.879
You sold your horns?

06:19.671 --> 06:20.672
It's okay.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.052
No work and no horns?
Sounds like dicey territory.

06:25.135 --> 06:29.348
I'm fine.
Still clean, going on seven years.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.643
Wow, that's great. I'm proud of you.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.811
What, is this where we hug?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.153
-Hug this.
-Oh, fuck.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.496
You know, he does have other wives.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.498
You can get them to go.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.582
Nah.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.547
Remember that Serbian woman? Branka.

07:01.630 --> 07:05.050
Branka-- Wow. Good memory.
Shit, she was hot.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.678
I must have jerked off to her
a hundred times and so did you.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.681
-No, I was too busy getting laid.
-You're full of shit.

07:12.349 --> 07:16.645
-How did he get himself women like that?
-He could be funny when he wanted to be.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.106
Does whipping our asses
with his belt count as funny?

07:19.189 --> 07:20.858
'Cause if it does, he was a hoot.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.197
Ray.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.662
I wanna be there.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.291
Not because he asked,
but because I want to.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.128
I wanna know what it looks like
to put him underground,

07:41.628 --> 07:42.880
what it feels like.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.091
But I'm scared it's gonna kick my ass.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.928
Come with me.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.629
J-- Wait one second.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.134
Really, is that necessary?

08:29.843 --> 08:30.844
You never know.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.472
Keys-- You got it.

08:46.902 --> 08:47.903
Where are we?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.448
'Bout a hour and a half out.

08:55.661 --> 08:58.455
I was having a dream
I was in a natural history museum.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.959
There was
one of those theater-like windows.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.043
Remember those?

09:03.544 --> 09:06.964
The naked cavemen killing a man with--
Your mom used to take us.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.174
No. That was your mom.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.427
My mom hated that place.
Said it gave her the creeps.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.513
No. Didn't your mom…

09:16.098 --> 09:17.558
Maybe you're right. Anyway…

09:17.641 --> 09:22.479
I'm in the museum and Dad--
Harris is one of the prehistoric men.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.022
Yeah.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.859
So I'm tryna break the glass,
tryna get him out, tryna free him.

09:26.942 --> 09:32.990
But I look down, and…
I'm naked too, like the other cavemen.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.537
What do you think it means?

09:39.621 --> 09:42.082
Means it's gonna take a whole lot more
than a hole in the ground

09:42.165 --> 09:44.001
to get the old man out of your head.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.549
It's hard to imagine him as a little boy.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.057
His father was a monster to him.
We repeat.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.851
-We don't have to.
-Yeah, but we do.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.311
It's the law of the land.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.062
Were you a monster to your boy?

10:09.193 --> 10:12.154
Hey-- I'm sorry.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.207
Hello? Reverend West?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.083
How are you?

10:25.751 --> 10:28.712
Yeah, we're on the road.
Do we come straight to you, or…

10:30.631 --> 10:31.924
All right.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.550
You can give him this number.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.430
-That it for you?
-Yep.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.809
-It's a cool store.
-Thanks.

10:42.893 --> 10:43.977
Is it yours?

10:44.478 --> 10:47.105
Yeah, right.
Do I look like a boss lady to you?

10:48.398 --> 10:49.525
Yeah, you sure do.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.237
It's like most girls in the South.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.822
-So, like, I decided to rebel a little.
-Really?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.950
That is amazing.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.088
What was that about in there?

11:12.256 --> 11:13.257
Nothing.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.176
They just come to you, don't they?

11:16.260 --> 11:17.761
Like flies to shit.

11:28.397 --> 11:29.606
Reverend West called.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.609
How long have they even known each other?

11:32.693 --> 11:34.987
I mean, Dad died alone, I bet.

11:35.696 --> 11:39.616
This guy just stepped in to make it all
a little less desperate and depressing.

11:40.534 --> 11:45.956
And this is what the end looks like
when you've alienated everyone.

11:47.291 --> 11:50.252
And now they've called us in
to be the shills.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.337
You don't have any good memories of him?

11:55.215 --> 11:58.468
I have some. I wish I didn't.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.553
Why?

12:06.768 --> 12:07.895
Hello? Raymond.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.065
This is Mr. Canfield
from Remembrance Funeral Homes.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.233
Oh, yes. Hi.

12:13.317 --> 12:17.154
First off, let me say
that I am very sorry for your loss.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.238
Well, thank you.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.782
I met your father briefly
a couple of years ago,

12:20.866 --> 12:22.492
when he was making arrangements.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.579
Very charismatic. A sensitive soul.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.830
My condolences.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.208
What kind of arrangements?

12:29.291 --> 12:31.168
He wanted to have an open casket.

12:32.127 --> 12:35.756
That requires embalming, of course,
and we need to start on that right away

12:35.839 --> 12:38.300
if we want to have
an early afternoon viewing,

12:38.884 --> 12:40.636
which is what he requested.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.179
Okay.

12:42.471 --> 12:47.100
The thing is, your father prepaid
for the casket and the headstone

12:47.184 --> 12:52.231
and a deposit on the embalming,
but he never paid the balance.

12:52.314 --> 12:55.067
-I know in this difficult moment it's--
-How much is it?

12:55.150 --> 12:57.069
-I'm sorry?
-That's my brother, Ray.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.153
Here.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.198
Nice to meet you, sir.
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:01.573 --> 13:02.658
How much is it?

13:02.741 --> 13:07.371
All in, with taxes, it's $475,
and that includes cosmetic work.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.206
You talking 'bout makeup?

13:09.289 --> 13:12.501
Yes. We would like to prepare him
so that the experience is as rewarding--

13:12.584 --> 13:15.045
Yeah, that's a bullshit expense.
We don't need that.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.421
We don't need to see him.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.132
Excuse me, I didn't catch that.

13:19.675 --> 13:23.303
Please, go ahead with it.
We'll settle up when we get there.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.557
Also, a Mr. Mendez,
your father's attorney,

13:26.640 --> 13:28.433
called earlier
to see how things were going.

13:28.517 --> 13:32.187
-And I will text you his number now.
-Okay, thank you very much.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.397
See you soon.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.149
Harris's attorney?

13:37.526 --> 13:39.570
I mean, $500? Can you afford that?

13:39.653 --> 13:41.989
No, but we only do this funeral once.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.740
-Let's do it right.
-But I can't afford it.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.409
-I'm not gonna pay.
-I'll do it, Ray.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.869
Is that all right with you?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.705
Jesus Christ.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.463
Put it on speaker.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.721
Max Mendez.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.473
Yes. Mr. Mendez, my name's Raymond.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.101
My father was Ben Harris.

14:11.185 --> 14:13.937
-Yes. I'm very sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

14:14.646 --> 14:18.066
Your father was an exemplary man.
A very charming man too.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.819
Yeah, he will be missed. I am sure of it.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.488
You wanted to talk with us?

14:23.989 --> 14:26.909
Yes. Unfortunately,
I have another client waiting for me.

14:27.326 --> 14:30.495
Could you come by a little later?
There are some things to go over.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.080
Is your brother Ray with you?

14:33.248 --> 14:34.249
Yes.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.668
-Good. 11:00?
-11:00 is good.

14:36.752 --> 14:40.255
I will text you my address.
And as your father used to say, à bientôt.

14:42.466 --> 14:43.592
À bientôt?

14:52.851 --> 14:54.937
You remember he made us go
to those French lessons,

14:55.020 --> 14:57.356
and then he changed his mind
and pulled us out?

14:58.649 --> 15:00.234
I really enjoyed those.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.404
Thank you.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.700
Sorry.

15:13.705 --> 15:14.706
Sorry.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.713
I'm looking for Mr. Canfield.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.048
Hi. That's me.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.133
You're Mr. Raymond Harris?

15:25.217 --> 15:26.593
-Yeah.
-Hi. Pleased to meet you.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.095
-This is Ray.
-Hi.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.432
Rose, find out how long
until Mr. Harris is ready.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.185
I'm very sorry for your loss.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.523
So, you have a good trip?

15:39.606 --> 15:40.691
Yes, thank you.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.734
Where do you make your home?

15:44.027 --> 15:45.612
Couple hundred miles from here.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.990
You resemble your father.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.243
Mr. Harris will be ready in a few minutes.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.829
Felix will come looking for you.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.289
Great. In the meantime,

15:55.372 --> 15:58.542
I want to show you the casket
that your father pre-selected.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.377
If you'll follow me this way.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.090
Thanks.

16:12.556 --> 16:15.434
If you don't mind waiting right here,
I'll be right with you.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.910
Really?

16:32.993 --> 16:35.329
The cheapest man who ever lived.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.289
I believe it wasn't a matter of cost.

16:37.372 --> 16:42.586
I offered him discounts on other caskets,
but he insisted.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.297
He said it was his favorite thing
about being a Jew,

16:46.173 --> 16:48.592
the humility of the casket,

16:48.675 --> 16:50.636
which brings me to my question.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.055
I know he was close with Reverend West,

16:53.138 --> 16:55.474
but perhaps you would also like a rabbi
to attend?

16:55.557 --> 16:57.893
-That won't be necessary.
-No. Our father was not a Jew.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.728
-He converted for 30 minutes once…
-Right.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.022
…and-- No, and he was still miserable.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.357
No rabbi. Thank you.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.317
Mr. Harris is ready.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.529
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.460
I worked on him a little.

17:24.545 --> 17:27.548
He was quite emaciated.

17:27.631 --> 17:28.924
Yeah. Well, thank you.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.717
How'd he die?

17:31.593 --> 17:34.221
Well, you would have to speak
with his physician about that,

17:34.304 --> 17:38.100
but I believe the death certificate
mentioned congestive heart failure

17:38.183 --> 17:40.352
and cancer of the lung.

17:41.687 --> 17:45.315
Your father's wish was
to be buried naked inside the casket.

17:45.816 --> 17:49.611
I suggest he wear a shirt for the viewing,
if you could provide one.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.781
Will you be expecting
a large group of people?

17:54.366 --> 17:55.576
Why, I don't think so.

17:56.201 --> 17:59.246
Well, we'll leave you alone with him.

18:18.599 --> 18:19.933
When did you last see him?

18:22.144 --> 18:23.812
Maybe at one of your weddings.

18:25.856 --> 18:29.526
He only came to my wedding with Marsha.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.236
Yeah.

18:32.029 --> 18:33.864
He called your brother-in-law a retard,
remember?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.741
Then your father-in-law
almost attacked him.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.285
I mean, that reception was
one punch from a shit show.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.537
It wasn't like that.
Don't rewrite history, Ray.

18:41.038 --> 18:45.250
Was he always this little?
What's this shit about being buried naked?

18:45.334 --> 18:47.711
He was always such an exhibitionist.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.050
His dick is still bigger than ours.

18:58.305 --> 19:01.141
It was really something
seeing him lying there like that.

19:03.727 --> 19:07.147
He's really gone now. I feel it.

19:08.649 --> 19:11.902
I feel good about it. Letting it go.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.073
Forgiveness is good.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.625
Come in. Come in, men.

19:27.876 --> 19:31.505
So good to finally meet you,
to put faces to the names.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.675
-Well, thank you for meeting with us.
-Of course. Sit, please.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.261
Coffee? Water?

19:37.344 --> 19:38.804
-No, we're good.
-No, thanks.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.974
You know, it's funny.
I heard him say so many times,

19:42.057 --> 19:44.351
"My sons, my children, my boys."

19:45.602 --> 19:48.522
How long did you know our father?

19:48.605 --> 19:49.982
About seven years.

19:51.024 --> 19:54.403
I represented a man who was suing him
for slander.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.072
And my client won that case.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.116
Your father was so impressed by my work

19:59.199 --> 20:02.452
that he hired me
to help him sue the city of Bon Air.

20:02.536 --> 20:03.537
For what?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.372
Christmas wreaths on City Hall.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.208
He said it violated the separation
of church and state.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.294
How could he even afford you?

20:10.377 --> 20:11.795
I worked for him pro bono.

20:12.296 --> 20:16.133
Your father was a great conversationalist,
a ferocious debater.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.720
Not sophisticated necessarily,
but tireless.

20:20.554 --> 20:23.640
I would pay him just to hear him gripe
about the world the way he did.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.768
Okay. Your father's last will.

20:28.520 --> 20:33.525
He leaves all his assets,
it's about $5200 in a checking account,

20:33.609 --> 20:36.820
to be divided equally among his sons
that attend the funeral.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.155
I know it doesn't sound like much,

20:38.238 --> 20:40.449
but maybe it can help
with the funeral expenses.

20:40.532 --> 20:42.492
Travel expenses, perhaps.

20:43.202 --> 20:47.414
Or you can throw a reception
for the attendees afterwards.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.125
It's up to you.

20:54.463 --> 20:58.175
Your father also left you
some personal items at his home.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.718
Here is his address.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.763
And Ms. Delgado will be there all day.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.348
-Ms. Delgado?
-Yes, sir.

21:04.973 --> 21:11.355
And lastly, it was also your father's wish
that you dig his grave.

21:13.857 --> 21:14.858
What?

21:14.942 --> 21:19.863
That his sons dig his grave on their own,
without machinery.

21:20.364 --> 21:21.865
Shovels are fine, of course.

21:22.658 --> 21:28.205
And then, you are to lower the casket
into the ground and cover the grave again.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.374
-What an asshole.
-No, Ray.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.709
-No…
-No. Is this even allowed?

21:32.793 --> 21:34.878
The cemetery must accommodate all faiths.

21:34.962 --> 21:37.548
Your father claimed
his Tongan roots demanded it.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.550
'Cause of our Tongan roots.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.095
-Yeah.
-Here's the permit.

21:45.889 --> 21:48.559
When you get there, please identify
yourselves to the funeral director

21:48.642 --> 21:50.018
so that you can dig.

21:50.102 --> 21:53.146
Make sure to bring
a valid driver's license.

22:19.882 --> 22:22.384
Hi. We're Harris's sons.

22:23.427 --> 22:24.970
I'm sorry for your loss.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.180
Thank you.

22:33.145 --> 22:34.313
What is that?

22:34.855 --> 22:36.398
-What?
-What you did.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.692
D-- Nothing.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.862
It looks like something. What is it for?

22:41.945 --> 22:43.572
It's just a bad habit.

22:44.239 --> 22:45.490
It makes you feel better?

22:47.367 --> 22:49.077
It's all good. You are safe here.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.540
Your father's room is upstairs,
the last room.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.626
I'm cooking something.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.420
-Lucia.
-I'm Raymond.

22:58.504 --> 23:00.172
-This is--
-Raymond and Ray.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.509
You're safe here, buddy.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.459
What's that?

23:39.711 --> 23:41.630
His little altar to himself.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.588
Hey, look at this.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.641
Who the hell are they?

24:35.434 --> 24:36.518
I don't know.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.312
Are you guys hungry?

24:38.395 --> 24:41.607
Oh, no. We're fine, thank you.

24:41.690 --> 24:43.525
-We're good, thanks.
-Thanks.

24:43.609 --> 24:44.818
I'll get your boxes.

24:53.577 --> 24:56.371
Look. The moms. So beautiful.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.251
Before he sucked the lifeblood
out of them.

25:01.335 --> 25:02.419
Fuck.

25:34.660 --> 25:37.329
Hey, it's just like Christmas.

25:37.412 --> 25:38.830
Yeah, except we're not kids.

25:40.624 --> 25:41.625
Are we not?

25:41.708 --> 25:44.711
We're a couple of grown-ass men
whose lives didn't pan out.

25:44.795 --> 25:46.505
-Don't say that.
-It's the truth.

25:46.588 --> 25:47.923
Hey, you're pissing me off.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.050
-Easy, horse.
-Hey, fuck you, Ray.

25:50.133 --> 25:53.262
-Don't say my life hasn't panned out!
-I like you angry. About fucking time.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.907
Oh, n-- Thank you.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.455
Thank you.

26:25.878 --> 26:27.004
Looks good.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.300
This is delicious.

26:31.383 --> 26:32.551
I know.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.469
How long have you worked here?

26:35.470 --> 26:36.597
It's my house.

26:40.017 --> 26:41.643
I love the way you've set it up.

26:42.102 --> 26:46.481
Very free-spirited and yet still sensible.

26:48.734 --> 26:49.776
Thank you.

26:51.195 --> 26:52.446
Was Harris your tenant?

26:52.946 --> 26:56.241
No. My ex-husband and I had a car wash.

26:57.242 --> 26:59.536
Harris came to the store for cigarettes.

27:00.495 --> 27:04.666
He was older, but he was friendly
and a good listener.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.046
We were lovers for a while.
Then we stayed friends.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.758
And when he got sick last year,
I moved him in.

27:14.676 --> 27:18.096
He looked at that picture of you guys
at the lake all the time.

27:19.765 --> 27:22.601
I said to him,
"Why don't you call these boys?

27:22.684 --> 27:23.894
They can visit you."

27:25.687 --> 27:26.813
He said no.

27:27.856 --> 27:30.651
He said, "The boys and the men
were not the same thing."

29:02.743 --> 29:04.077
Is it one of yours?

29:04.995 --> 29:05.996
Yeah.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.665
Uh-huh.

29:09.750 --> 29:12.753
He took it from me
after one of our big fights,

29:12.836 --> 29:14.087
summer of senior year.

29:19.051 --> 29:20.719
He told me he pawned it.

29:23.639 --> 29:27.142
Must have scoured every pawn shop
in the States.

29:30.479 --> 29:35.859
I mean, he was always an asshole to me,
but that was the beginning of the end.

29:36.610 --> 29:37.945
What was the fight about?

29:39.905 --> 29:41.031
I have no idea.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.826
He had that cleaned
and fixed just a few weeks ago.

30:12.437 --> 30:14.189
I had no idea
you thought my life was shit.

30:14.273 --> 30:15.983
-That's not what I said.
-I heard what you said.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.734
-You said my life hadn't panned out…
-I--

30:17.818 --> 30:20.362
-…which is one way of calling out failure.
-No, I--

30:20.445 --> 30:22.364
-I like things the way I like them.
-I--

30:22.447 --> 30:23.448
Steady.

30:23.949 --> 30:26.451
Maybe that makes me boring or lazy.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.955
It cost me my marriages. I know that.

30:31.540 --> 30:35.002
Olive said I was more interested
in air conditioning than I was in her.

30:36.170 --> 30:38.797
The first time
Marsha saw me ironing a perfect shirt,

30:39.756 --> 30:42.050
she burst into tears thinking I was gay.

30:45.053 --> 30:46.555
I like my peace and quiet.

30:47.431 --> 30:49.975
If that means my life didn't pan out,
then it didn't pan out.

30:50.058 --> 30:51.977
I'm okay. I sleep like a baby.

30:54.605 --> 30:56.106
We come from chaos.

31:08.118 --> 31:09.995
I hope everything is satisfactory.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.582
Yeah, it's fine. Thank you. It looks good.

31:14.208 --> 31:16.460
We will have to begin our move
to the cemetery

31:16.543 --> 31:18.128
in about an hour and a half

31:18.212 --> 31:21.924
in order to make his desired time
for the burial at sunset,

31:22.007 --> 31:23.967
allowing for the time to dig.

31:24.051 --> 31:25.511
Mr. Mendez spoke with you both

31:25.594 --> 31:27.846
about your father's wishes
with respect to that?

31:27.930 --> 31:29.223
He did.

31:29.306 --> 31:30.432
I think we'll be fine.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.100
Oh, goody.

31:32.184 --> 31:33.352
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

31:33.435 --> 31:35.187
Bonnie. Michael.

31:35.771 --> 31:36.772
Who's Michael?

31:38.232 --> 31:41.777
It's often uncomfortable
for mourners to be the first to arrive

31:41.860 --> 31:43.278
and find an empty room.

31:43.362 --> 31:45.364
You know, the deceased by himself.

31:45.447 --> 31:50.369
So, sometimes we, you know,
place a couple of people just to sit in.

31:50.452 --> 31:52.538
At no cost to the family, of course.

31:52.621 --> 31:55.249
And then,
as the room begins to gradually fill,

31:55.332 --> 31:56.875
they will step out discreetly.

31:56.959 --> 31:58.377
-Great.
-Yep.

31:58.961 --> 32:01.880
I'll need you to sign some documents
in my office, though.

32:03.215 --> 32:04.633
Yeah, and I'll need your driver's license.

32:08.762 --> 32:11.139
Try not to fuck
the funeral home receptionist

32:11.223 --> 32:12.641
at our own father's viewing.

32:12.724 --> 32:13.934
Okay, I'll try.

33:05.444 --> 33:07.154
You're cold as ice, Pops.

33:33.472 --> 33:36.558
All right, thank you. You can go.
Thanks. Shoo.

34:13.303 --> 34:15.429
Unfortunately, I can't stay longer.

34:16.473 --> 34:18.433
Don't worry. Thank you so much for coming.

34:18.516 --> 34:20.310
No, I'm happy to be here. Yeah.

34:22.563 --> 34:23.938
That didn't sound right, huh?

34:28.318 --> 34:33.282
Look at you. You have a good smile.
It's open. It does not lie.

34:44.042 --> 34:46.378
Are you married? Kids?

34:46.460 --> 34:51.675
I'm separated. Twice divorced before that.

34:52.301 --> 34:53.510
Wow.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.764
And… how many kids?

35:00.934 --> 35:02.019
I have a son.

35:04.730 --> 35:05.856
He's in the Army…

35:07.441 --> 35:09.193
And Wh--

35:10.235 --> 35:11.820
You don't want to talk about him?

35:12.654 --> 35:13.864
No, it's fine--

35:14.990 --> 35:16.491
How long are you guys in town?

35:16.575 --> 35:19.703
If you need a place to sleep,
his room is available, of course.

35:19.786 --> 35:20.913
Thank you.

35:20.996 --> 35:22.831
But I don't think I could sleep
in that room.

35:22.915 --> 35:23.916
Why?

35:23.999 --> 35:25.083
The hospital bed is gone

35:25.167 --> 35:28.420
and everything's going
to the Salvation Army or to the trash.

35:28.504 --> 35:30.005
-Is that what he wanted?
-Yeah.

35:30.088 --> 35:33.383
He left everyone something, and that's it.
The rest must go.

35:36.970 --> 35:39.264
But if you want anything like,
I don't know,

35:39.348 --> 35:44.561
photos of you guys or your moms,
it's okay for me.

35:53.237 --> 35:54.404
Hi.

36:00.202 --> 36:01.286
I will see you later.

36:01.370 --> 36:02.371
Yeah, okay.

37:25.370 --> 37:26.747
Do I know you?

37:27.331 --> 37:28.498
I don't think so.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.375
You sure?

37:30.459 --> 37:31.460
Yeah.

37:31.543 --> 37:34.254
So why you look at me like that
when I walk by?

37:35.589 --> 37:36.590
Like what?

37:36.673 --> 37:40.093
-You think I enjoy it?
-No, I--

37:40.177 --> 37:42.763
I'm just trying to understand
where you're coming from.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.974
Wait, you reminded me of someone.

37:47.518 --> 37:50.938
You think I should be flattered,
is that it?

38:19.800 --> 38:24.805
I'm sorry about gawking at you out there.
That was a crappy thing to do.

38:25.722 --> 38:28.183
Yes, crappy and creepy.

38:29.476 --> 38:34.982
Well, I will endeavor
to stop behaving like an asshole.

38:35.899 --> 38:37.568
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:39.945 --> 38:43.699
I'm Ray. That's my father, Harris.

38:46.994 --> 38:47.995
Kiera.

38:49.580 --> 38:51.790
I was one of his nurses at St. Anne's.

38:52.416 --> 38:53.584
My condolences.

38:55.586 --> 38:57.754
You always come
to your patient's funerals?

38:57.838 --> 38:58.839
No.

38:59.631 --> 39:00.966
He asked me to.

39:01.592 --> 39:05.345
He said it gave him comfort to know
I'd be here, and I'm happy to do it.

39:06.555 --> 39:08.765
Something about your father captured me.

39:09.725 --> 39:14.438
A very old soul. Haunted.

39:17.191 --> 39:18.650
What was he like as a father?

39:19.943 --> 39:21.236
The worst.

39:23.071 --> 39:24.531
I wouldn't have guessed that.

39:25.866 --> 39:30.412
But then again, no one was there
towards the end except his friend Lucia.

39:30.495 --> 39:33.457
So, that explains that.

39:37.127 --> 39:39.463
-Are you having a burial?
-Oh, yeah.

39:40.047 --> 39:45.093
We're digging the grave ourselves,
my brother and I. His final request.

39:45.177 --> 39:46.887
Why would he want you to do that?

39:47.596 --> 39:49.556
Your guess is as good as mine.

39:49.640 --> 39:52.643
-What's yours?
-Trying to screw with our heads.

39:53.769 --> 39:57.356
Exercise his power over us
for as long as possible.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.816
You can always refuse.

40:01.610 --> 40:04.279
Yeah. We didn't.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.365
Well, then it worked.

40:12.204 --> 40:16.416
He was ready to go.
Even declined painkillers.

40:16.917 --> 40:19.753
He wanted to go out with all his senses.

40:20.879 --> 40:25.008
I think music helped him
get through a lot of it.

40:26.343 --> 40:32.140
He'd put on his earbuds
and plug into his phone and close his eyes

40:32.224 --> 40:33.892
and weather the pain.

40:35.561 --> 40:38.564
I asked him, I said, "What music is that?"

40:38.647 --> 40:40.482
He said, "It's a secret."

40:42.442 --> 40:45.279
But at night,
when I came in to check on him,

40:45.362 --> 40:50.492
I could tell it was the same song
over and over again.

40:52.160 --> 40:56.665
He'd fall asleep listening to it,
when he could.

41:01.420 --> 41:02.588
What song?

41:03.839 --> 41:08.427
I don't know.
Something instrumental. Bluesy, maybe.

41:20.814 --> 41:22.316
I should get going.

41:24.526 --> 41:26.987
Are you gonna be at the cemetery later?

41:27.905 --> 41:30.532
No, I wasn't planning on it.

41:30.616 --> 41:31.867
Oh, right.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.994
-Don't think I can.
-Of course not.

41:37.497 --> 41:38.832
Nice meeting you.

42:05.734 --> 42:08.904
Hey, I need you to call that Mendez,
the lawyer, right?

42:09.404 --> 42:11.156
I wanna find
all Dad's personal belongings.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.950
You know,
all the stuff he left at the hospital.

42:13.033 --> 42:15.369
-What for?
-I just-- I want his cell phone.

42:15.452 --> 42:17.204
You won't be able to use it
past the billing date.

42:17.287 --> 42:19.540
No, not-- It's fine, all right?
Just call him.

42:19.623 --> 42:20.749
Thank you.

42:22.960 --> 42:23.961
Oh, fuck.

42:26.839 --> 42:29.091
Mr. Mendez. It's Raymond. Yeah.

42:29.174 --> 42:31.385
Do you know what happened
to our father's personal effects

42:31.468 --> 42:32.803
at the hospital?

42:35.764 --> 42:37.808
Okay, I-- We'll try that. Thank you.

42:37.891 --> 42:39.643
-So, what'd he say?
-He had no idea.

42:39.726 --> 42:40.978
-F--
-He said to ask--

42:41.061 --> 42:43.188
He said to ask Lucia.
She'll be at the cemetery.

42:43.272 --> 42:45.107
-All right. Well, did you get her number?
-What?

42:45.190 --> 42:47.109
Wha-- Call him back. Get her number.

42:47.192 --> 42:48.861
-What's up your ass?
-Just do it.

42:57.244 --> 42:59.246
-Voice mail.
-Fuck!

43:02.624 --> 43:04.293
You son of a bitch.

43:04.376 --> 43:06.211
You think you can laugh at me
from hell, huh?

43:06.295 --> 43:08.463
What the fuck do you know about music?

43:10.883 --> 43:11.884
It takes you 80 years

43:11.967 --> 43:14.261
to discover that it can help you
through your pain, huh?

43:14.344 --> 43:16.430
You moron.

43:22.394 --> 43:28.066
Don't fuck with me, Harris.
You'll regret it.

43:41.997 --> 43:43.081
Call me.

43:47.669 --> 43:48.670
God.

43:52.883 --> 43:54.843
Imagine if the moms were here now.

43:55.552 --> 43:57.387
-I'd rather not.
-Why?

43:57.471 --> 43:59.056
They'd get all tangled up.

43:59.139 --> 44:00.140
Not my mom.

44:00.724 --> 44:02.017
No, when she shed him off,

44:02.100 --> 44:05.229
I think she shed him off for good,
like changing skin.

44:08.148 --> 44:12.402
The shit he got away with.
I mean, can you imagine?

44:13.028 --> 44:15.989
I mean, his wife and his lover
become lifelong friends.

44:17.366 --> 44:19.243
It's like the Battered Wives Club.

44:21.119 --> 44:22.120
Well--

44:23.830 --> 44:25.791
He was just a guy, Ray.

44:25.874 --> 44:30.671
I mean, I know he could be a real asshole,
and he could lose control, but--

44:31.922 --> 44:34.049
Well, he--
Shit things happened to him too.

44:34.132 --> 44:35.300
No, it's no excuse.

44:35.384 --> 44:37.719
You know, he should take responsibility
for his own life.

44:37.803 --> 44:40.264
It's his life, his responsibility.

44:40.347 --> 44:42.015
Yeah,
like our lives are our responsibility.

44:42.099 --> 44:44.101
Oh, God.
Why won't you point the finger at him?

44:44.184 --> 44:46.353
-What good would that do now?
-Just face the facts.

44:46.436 --> 44:47.896
-I face the facts.
-No, you don't.

44:47.980 --> 44:49.523
-Fuck off.
-I mean, he fucked your wife.

44:49.606 --> 44:51.733
-Thanks for reminding me, Ray.
-What, you forgot?

44:51.817 --> 44:54.361
Fuck you! Pull over!

44:54.444 --> 44:56.822
I'll walk the rest of the way
and dig the fucking hole myself,

44:57.406 --> 44:58.949
you piece of shit.

45:11.420 --> 45:16.091
Your anger, Ray. I couldn't carry it.
It would crush me.

45:27.519 --> 45:29.062
Good afternoon.

45:30.147 --> 45:32.024
I'm with Cederdale Cemeteries.

45:33.650 --> 45:36.195
-I'm very sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

45:36.278 --> 45:38.864
I took the liberty of removing the grass
to mark the area.

45:39.364 --> 45:40.490
Okay. Thank you.

45:40.991 --> 45:43.702
This flat blade is
gonna make things easier for you later.

45:43.785 --> 45:46.413
This pickax for harder areas, rocks too.

45:46.496 --> 45:47.664
How deep?

45:48.874 --> 45:49.958
Six feet.

45:50.834 --> 45:51.835
Right.

45:52.544 --> 45:54.505
I'll be around here if you need me.

45:54.588 --> 45:55.714
Thanks.

46:01.929 --> 46:03.096
Why are there no dates?

46:03.680 --> 46:07.059
-It's what he requested.
-Did he say why?

46:07.142 --> 46:08.268
He did not.

46:11.355 --> 46:12.481
Get to it.

46:19.112 --> 46:21.823
Gentlemen. Rev. West.

46:23.075 --> 46:24.660
It's great to finally meet you,

46:26.161 --> 46:27.579
despite the circumstances.

46:27.663 --> 46:28.997
My condolences.

46:29.081 --> 46:30.082
Thank you.

46:31.375 --> 46:33.210
-Mr. Canfield.
-Reverend West.

46:34.628 --> 46:38.882
Harris spoke about you men many times,
always in glowing terms.

46:38.966 --> 46:39.967
Yeah.

46:41.802 --> 46:42.886
Some backbreaking work.

46:45.430 --> 46:46.932
Did I say something funny?

46:47.432 --> 46:49.726
"Glowing terms." "Backbreaking work."

46:49.810 --> 46:51.728
It's just, where do you get that shit?

46:52.604 --> 46:53.605
Are my words shit?

46:53.689 --> 46:55.941
I mean,
do they teach that at divinity school?

46:56.024 --> 46:57.192
How to speak like a prophet?

46:57.276 --> 46:59.945
I apologize for my very unhappy brother,
Reverend.

47:02.114 --> 47:04.825
No worries. A difficult day for all.

47:05.450 --> 47:07.411
But what's he even need
a pastor for anyway?

47:07.494 --> 47:09.413
The last time I checked, he was Jewish.

47:10.205 --> 47:13.542
He was Buddhist before that. Muslim.

47:13.625 --> 47:15.252
Harris was a restless seeker.

47:16.044 --> 47:17.379
He was circumcised at 50.

47:17.462 --> 47:18.881
That's enough.

47:18.964 --> 47:23.302
I did not know that. Painful, I'm sure.

47:23.385 --> 47:25.804
What about the dates?
How come there are no dates?

47:26.805 --> 47:28.682
He was never sure about his birthday.

47:29.641 --> 47:32.102
Didn't want the stone to be wrong,
so he opted for no dates.

47:32.186 --> 47:34.730
Who would know or care if it was wrong?

47:36.398 --> 47:38.150
Few things matter to a dying man.

47:38.233 --> 47:39.401
This mattered to him.

47:41.445 --> 47:44.114
Just keep it secular as best you can.
Huh, Rev.?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.700
I'm a Christian pastor, Ray.

47:59.004 --> 48:01.006
That's them, my love.

48:03.634 --> 48:05.427
Let me help with that.

48:05.928 --> 48:07.054
Thank you, Reverend.

48:08.388 --> 48:09.681
Thank you very much.

48:10.182 --> 48:11.391
Mr. Canfield.

48:11.975 --> 48:13.352
Ms. Delgado.

48:13.435 --> 48:17.356
Hi, guys. This is my son, Simon.

48:18.398 --> 48:21.902
Raymond and Ray. Your brothers.

48:22.986 --> 48:24.238
Nice to meet you.

48:25.989 --> 48:26.990
Hello.

48:27.074 --> 48:28.367
Hey.

48:32.538 --> 48:33.539
Over there.

48:41.672 --> 48:43.090
Thank you, Reverend.

48:46.593 --> 48:48.637
-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Yeah, of course.

48:48.720 --> 48:51.598
My father's stuff back at the hospital,
do you know where that is?

48:51.682 --> 48:53.392
At home. What are you looking for?

48:53.475 --> 48:54.476
His cell phone.

48:55.060 --> 48:56.728
Harris left that to Simon. Yeah.

48:57.396 --> 48:58.814
Simon, come here.

49:02.568 --> 49:04.027
Show your brother the phone.

49:05.404 --> 49:06.905
You got any music on here?

49:07.447 --> 49:09.408
Not yet. Just reset it today.

49:10.325 --> 49:11.326
He's a techie.

49:12.828 --> 49:15.414
-So, you don't have any of Harris's stuff?
-No.

49:16.623 --> 49:17.916
Did you back it up?

49:18.000 --> 49:19.585
No, what for?

49:29.011 --> 49:30.012
Thanks.

49:58.457 --> 50:00.083
A whiskey priest, hey.

50:01.752 --> 50:02.753
Don't judge me, Ray.

50:02.836 --> 50:05.797
Just a fellow like any other,
running on feet of clay.

50:07.216 --> 50:09.009
Is that how you
and Harris found each other?

50:10.385 --> 50:13.222
Nah.
Harris stopped drinking before I met him.

50:14.515 --> 50:16.350
He said it revived him, being sober.

50:17.184 --> 50:19.353
He was in his late 60s
when he fathered that boy.

50:21.355 --> 50:22.940
Life is unstoppable.

50:23.023 --> 50:25.526
And no, that is not from divinity school.

50:30.531 --> 50:32.783
-You got a family, Ray?
-No.

50:32.866 --> 50:34.701
I wouldn't know what to do with a kid.

50:37.496 --> 50:38.580
Especially a boy.

50:39.081 --> 50:40.541
Is a girl any easier?

50:40.624 --> 50:44.795
'Cause I got a girl and…
taken years off my life.

50:47.965 --> 50:49.174
What is it about a boy?

50:50.175 --> 50:51.343
Back off, Reverend.

50:56.431 --> 50:58.267
Got a question for you, though.

50:58.350 --> 51:00.561
You really think
that Harris believed in God?

51:02.062 --> 51:04.857
-I don't care.
-No, come on. You're shitting me.

51:05.524 --> 51:09.903
What matters is that we all belong
to something greater than us.

51:11.071 --> 51:12.072
An infinite.

51:13.907 --> 51:15.075
Your father knew that.

51:15.826 --> 51:17.202
No.

51:17.286 --> 51:19.913
That is a humble thought,

51:21.164 --> 51:23.792
and my father didn't have a humble bone
in his body.

51:24.334 --> 51:26.587
Maybe he grew one
when he realized the end was near.

51:26.670 --> 51:28.463
Yeah, maybe it's easier at the end.

51:29.089 --> 51:31.383
That's when all the bullies
shit their pants.

51:32.759 --> 51:34.344
Nah, he was never scared.

51:35.846 --> 51:37.973
Only sad that the wonderful ride was over.

51:39.516 --> 51:42.519
That's how he put it.
"The wonderful ride."

51:52.988 --> 51:54.072
Talk to me, Ray.

51:58.243 --> 51:59.578
What about?

52:02.623 --> 52:03.707
What for?

52:04.958 --> 52:08.462
It's all gonna be over, a couple hours.

52:11.965 --> 52:12.966
You sure about that?

52:15.344 --> 52:16.345
Oh, yeah.

52:22.434 --> 52:23.435
I got it.

52:36.573 --> 52:38.951
That boy, he bugs me.

52:50.212 --> 52:54.550
No reception here. That makes sense.

53:02.599 --> 53:03.809
Where do you work?

53:05.185 --> 53:10.566
Water and Power Department
in Cincinnati. It's not very exciting.

53:11.733 --> 53:12.818
You don't like it?

53:13.944 --> 53:15.362
Find something else.

53:16.905 --> 53:18.031
I don't know.

53:18.532 --> 53:21.159
You can have stability
with an exciting job.

53:21.827 --> 53:23.829
Risk makes you feel alive.

53:25.122 --> 53:28.333
Sometimes even getting a little sloppy
can be good.

53:29.126 --> 53:30.836
-Can it?
-Yeah.

53:33.630 --> 53:35.257
You are so funny.

53:37.384 --> 53:41.763
I drive an Uber four days a week,
and I am a bartender three nights.

53:43.015 --> 53:46.268
The driving is easier,
but the bar is more money.

53:47.853 --> 53:51.356
Both jobs give me a front-row seat
to the human circus every day.

54:01.617 --> 54:06.163
Sunscreen. The sun is a silent killer.

54:17.716 --> 54:18.717
Keep going.

55:40.007 --> 55:42.926
Simon, please! Don't do that here!

55:43.010 --> 55:44.094
Nobody cares.

55:44.636 --> 55:45.846
Incredible.

55:47.014 --> 55:48.015
Stop.

55:51.185 --> 55:52.311
It's my turn.

55:53.437 --> 55:56.815
I'm not sure that's going to be possible.
I mean, legally I would need to--

55:56.899 --> 55:58.734
Come on. It's his birthright.

55:58.817 --> 56:00.110
Yeah, I think it's okay.

56:01.069 --> 56:02.237
Here.

56:23.592 --> 56:24.635
Mr. West?

56:25.260 --> 56:27.638
-Reverend West. Yes?
-Sorry we're late.

56:27.721 --> 56:31.391
-One of our flights was delayed.
-You're not late. Leon?

56:31.475 --> 56:32.476
-Leon.
-Leon.

56:32.559 --> 56:33.685
-Leon, Vincent.
-Yeah.

56:33.769 --> 56:36.271
Raymond. Ray. That's Simon over there.

56:37.981 --> 56:39.149
Condolences.

56:39.233 --> 56:40.234
Our sympathies.

56:40.317 --> 56:41.318
Thank you.

56:41.860 --> 56:44.780
Harris and our mother were custodians
at a community center

56:44.863 --> 56:46.740
-in Tallahassee in the '90s.
-Tallahassee.

56:48.534 --> 56:49.535
Simon.

56:49.618 --> 56:51.828
Come meet your brothers!

56:51.912 --> 56:54.164
-I met them already.
-There's more.

56:54.248 --> 56:56.083
Let me know when they're all here.

56:58.293 --> 56:59.837
They have to dig too.

57:17.604 --> 57:21.358
Look at Ray. He's all--
What is the expression?

57:22.484 --> 57:25.529
Tied up. Tied up in knots, huh?

57:26.363 --> 57:27.489
Both of you.

57:35.664 --> 57:37.875
The old man was always screwing with us.

57:40.586 --> 57:41.920
Gave us the same name.

57:43.172 --> 57:46.425
So our moms called us Raymond
and Ray to avoid confusion,

57:46.508 --> 57:50.429
but he'd just call me Ray
and him Raymond and wreak havoc.

57:52.097 --> 57:55.767
Ray would get rewarded for my stuff
or I'd get punished for his.

57:57.019 --> 57:59.271
Or he'd go see one of his games
instead of mine.

57:59.354 --> 58:02.566
I was a good athlete, but Ray sucked.

58:02.649 --> 58:07.029
I mean, he was a genius student.
Straight A's. But he sucked at sports.

58:09.156 --> 58:12.492
The old man would start fights
with the referees or the other dads.

58:13.827 --> 58:16.580
Drive our mothers crazy, but he loved it.

58:18.582 --> 58:21.168
Having us all bouncing around
like pinballs.

58:23.712 --> 58:25.422
Ray took it the hardest.

58:28.342 --> 58:32.804
He's a recovering addict,
and at his worst, he was a train wreck.

58:34.640 --> 58:37.226
I tried to reach out to him to help,

58:37.309 --> 58:39.394
but he wouldn't let me anywhere near him.

58:40.229 --> 58:44.858
He was so embarrassed,
the state he was in. He vanished.

58:46.985 --> 58:50.113
And then he found a woman
who helped him turn his life around.

58:51.573 --> 58:52.741
And then she died.

58:54.785 --> 58:56.286
I mean, son of a bitch.

59:04.419 --> 59:06.171
I made him come here with me today.

59:08.173 --> 59:10.843
This is like ground zero
for everything he hates.

59:29.903 --> 59:31.196
Thanks for coming.

59:32.197 --> 59:33.282
I didn't wanna miss--

59:33.824 --> 59:35.200
Yeah. I mean, who would?

59:37.411 --> 59:38.537
Who are they?

59:40.163 --> 59:41.582
They're Harris's sons too.

59:42.332 --> 59:44.293
Yeah. Even the kid.

59:44.376 --> 59:46.545
-Little guy?
-Yeah. Lucia's.

59:46.628 --> 59:48.714
Wow. Go, Harris.

59:53.760 --> 59:56.638
-How many brothers are there?
-I have no idea.

59:56.722 --> 59:58.140
I just met them today.

59:58.223 --> 1:00:00.142
I mean, except for Raymond.

1:00:00.851 --> 1:00:02.019
You close to him?

1:00:02.728 --> 1:00:03.896
We're half brothers.

1:00:04.479 --> 1:00:07.858
Growing up,
we were connected at the hip. Inseparable.

1:00:08.775 --> 1:00:11.820
And then, we drifted apart
through high school.

1:00:11.904 --> 1:00:18.827
When you've been humiliated together,
degraded, devalued like we were by Harris,

1:00:20.078 --> 1:00:23.207
then just being near each other is
a reminder.

1:00:24.791 --> 1:00:27.669
But over the years, we stayed in touch.

1:00:27.753 --> 1:00:29.671
You know, he's good about that.

1:00:30.172 --> 1:00:35.844
I'm always reluctant,
but I never regret it.

1:00:40.432 --> 1:00:43.894
Sometimes I wonder
if we met today, if we'd even be friends.

1:00:47.022 --> 1:00:50.234
I mean, he likes this kind of thing.
Rituals.

1:00:51.610 --> 1:00:52.819
Rituals are comforting.

1:00:54.404 --> 1:00:59.910
Yeah. I mean, "I'm sorry for your loss."
I've heard that a dozen times today.

1:00:59.993 --> 1:01:02.287
It starts to sound like,
"Have a nice day," you know.

1:01:02.371 --> 1:01:03.872
Or, "Pass the salt." Or…

1:01:12.756 --> 1:01:17.553
I'm just--
My wife had this aggressive cancer,

1:01:17.636 --> 1:01:20.430
so I let her parents, you know,

1:01:20.514 --> 1:01:22.558
have complete say
in the funeral arrangements.

1:01:22.641 --> 1:01:25.018
I just couldn't deal.

1:01:25.686 --> 1:01:29.314
They had everything organized
and choreographed.

1:01:29.398 --> 1:01:34.403
So much pomp and circumstance
and solemnity standing in for sadness.

1:01:36.071 --> 1:01:38.615
I hope it did them some good.
It kicked my ass.

1:01:41.702 --> 1:01:46.081
I'm entertaining you
with stories of other funerals, you know.

1:01:47.457 --> 1:01:48.542
Suave.

1:01:49.042 --> 1:01:50.627
I don't need to be entertained.

1:02:03.015 --> 1:02:07.895
Mom! Look at these guys! They're acrobats!

1:02:11.773 --> 1:02:13.317
-Hup!
-Hey!

1:02:13.901 --> 1:02:15.068
Come on! Do some more!

1:02:16.069 --> 1:02:19.656
I think that's enough, little man.
Come see us sometime.

1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:21.158
-Please?
-Simon!

1:02:21.241 --> 1:02:24.036
Come on.
There's nothing wrong with a few tricks.

1:02:24.119 --> 1:02:26.330
Right, Reverend?
In honor of Simon's late father.

1:02:26.413 --> 1:02:28.874
I think it's okay, if everybody agrees?

1:02:31.627 --> 1:02:33.378
-Okay.
-Thanks, bro!

1:02:34.379 --> 1:02:36.340
Here we go. Ready? Hup!

1:02:42.429 --> 1:02:43.430
Here we go. Hup!

1:02:45.557 --> 1:02:46.517
Bravo!

1:02:49.311 --> 1:02:51.897
-There we go. Settle it.
-Uh-huh.

1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:53.065
There it is.

1:02:54.441 --> 1:02:55.943
Bravo!

1:02:56.026 --> 1:02:57.069
Coming down.

1:02:59.947 --> 1:03:01.949
Benches. Here we go. And…

1:03:07.162 --> 1:03:09.039
-Simon, come on in.
-Come on in.

1:03:09.122 --> 1:03:10.707
Hands up. Hand up here. Step on here.

1:03:10.791 --> 1:03:13.210
-Okay? Step up.
-Very good. There we go.

1:03:13.293 --> 1:03:14.837
Good. Nice and easy.

1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:16.797
-Step on his shoulder. Good.
-Good.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:18.632
Style with a smile. Hup!

1:03:19.216 --> 1:03:20.509
-Hey.
-Yay!

1:03:21.802 --> 1:03:23.512
-Bravo. Solid.
-Hey.

1:03:23.595 --> 1:03:25.222
-Nice.
-Coming on down.

1:03:25.305 --> 1:03:27.891
Three, two, one. Go.

1:03:29.059 --> 1:03:30.519
Wow.

1:03:30.602 --> 1:03:32.145
-Bravo!
-There he is.

1:03:32.229 --> 1:03:33.480
Mi amor.

1:03:40.821 --> 1:03:43.282
Shouldn't we talk to these guys,
get to know them?

1:03:44.157 --> 1:03:47.578
And then what?
Birthday parties, Christmas cards?

1:03:48.203 --> 1:03:49.830
I don't need any new people.

1:03:49.913 --> 1:03:52.416
Yeah. You're plenty busy
with all the friends and loved ones

1:03:52.499 --> 1:03:53.625
that surround you.

1:03:57.045 --> 1:03:59.423
Athena died on me. The rest is by choice.

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:05.387
You have anything to drink?

1:04:06.972 --> 1:04:09.600
-Yeah. I mean, they're warm.
-That's fine.

1:04:09.683 --> 1:04:11.476
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

1:04:13.270 --> 1:04:16.064
-When do you guys head back?
-Tonight, by bus.

1:04:16.148 --> 1:04:18.025
We have a show in Charlotte tomorrow.

1:04:18.942 --> 1:04:20.861
Did you see the old man often?

1:04:21.695 --> 1:04:22.779
We never met him.

1:04:23.739 --> 1:04:24.990
He wanted us here anyway.

1:04:25.532 --> 1:04:27.868
But how long were they together?
With your mom?

1:04:28.243 --> 1:04:30.120
Not long. A week or two.

1:04:30.621 --> 1:04:34.583
Vincent and I are fraternal twins.
Our stepdad, he's our true father.

1:04:35.167 --> 1:04:37.169
He'll wanna hear all about this.

1:04:37.669 --> 1:04:39.087
He'll get a kick out of it.

1:04:40.047 --> 1:04:41.048
No offense.

1:04:44.176 --> 1:04:45.719
You guys were close to him, right?

1:04:52.935 --> 1:04:53.936
-Thanks.
-Cheers.

1:04:54.019 --> 1:04:55.020
Yeah.

1:04:57.481 --> 1:05:00.734
Okay, let me get a picture of everybody.

1:05:01.443 --> 1:05:02.653
Please. Go.

1:05:02.736 --> 1:05:05.155
-Ray, you too. Please.
-No, I--

1:05:05.239 --> 1:05:07.282
Kiera, Mr. Canfield.

1:05:07.908 --> 1:05:10.494
Ay, get it there. Come on, Ray.

1:05:12.663 --> 1:05:14.623
You too, twins.

1:05:15.207 --> 1:05:16.959
Grave man, sir?

1:05:18.877 --> 1:05:21.421
Join us. You too. Perfect.

1:05:22.005 --> 1:05:24.174
Smile. Scooch in, everybody.

1:05:26.134 --> 1:05:28.762
Perfect. One more.

1:05:29.388 --> 1:05:34.601
The last one and… good.

1:05:35.936 --> 1:05:38.230
Thank you very much. Muchas gracias.

1:05:45.112 --> 1:05:47.906
-Thanks for putting up with that.
-No worries.

1:05:47.990 --> 1:05:50.450
Yeah, it's something
you can tell your grandkids about.

1:05:51.577 --> 1:05:52.995
Do you have kids?

1:05:53.078 --> 1:05:55.539
No. Never wanted to.

1:05:57.332 --> 1:05:59.251
Usually, people feel weird meeting a--

1:05:59.334 --> 1:06:02.004
a grown-ass woman
who doesn't have or want kids,

1:06:02.087 --> 1:06:04.798
like she's some unhappy freak of nature.

1:06:05.299 --> 1:06:07.968
Yeah. There's many ways to live a life.

1:06:09.803 --> 1:06:11.597
I read that in a fortune cookie.

1:06:29.656 --> 1:06:32.659
It's light. Is he even in there?

1:06:33.285 --> 1:06:35.787
Your father was down to 125 pounds.

1:06:35.871 --> 1:06:38.790
Wow. I had a dog once
that weighed more than that.

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:40.751
You remember Wilson, Raymond?

1:06:42.669 --> 1:06:45.714
Our dead dad weighs less than a dog.

1:06:45.797 --> 1:06:47.633
Shut up, Ray, or I'll kill you.

1:06:47.716 --> 1:06:49.259
Hey, do your part, boy.

1:07:06.693 --> 1:07:10.280
Reverend West, I want Simon
to see his father for the last time.

1:07:12.658 --> 1:07:14.034
I don't think that's a good idea.

1:07:14.117 --> 1:07:16.787
Ms. Delgado,
the time for viewing has passed.

1:07:16.870 --> 1:07:19.998
My son was at school,
and he couldn't come to the funeral home.

1:07:20.082 --> 1:07:21.333
He's entitled.

1:07:21.416 --> 1:07:25.963
Miss Delgado, Mr. Harris has been
traveling by car in this pine box…

1:07:26.421 --> 1:07:27.798
naked and unprotected.

1:07:27.881 --> 1:07:29.633
He's been sitting in the heat
for three hours.

1:07:29.716 --> 1:07:33.887
And he was just carried to this spot,
possibly banged up along the way.

1:07:33.971 --> 1:07:35.389
The body takes a toll.

1:07:35.472 --> 1:07:37.182
He's embalmed.

1:07:37.266 --> 1:07:40.143
I still don't recommend it.
I insist, actually.

1:07:40.644 --> 1:07:43.063
I'll take a look and see if he's okay.

1:07:44.231 --> 1:07:46.984
I'm sorry, but legally,
you are not next of kin.

1:07:47.067 --> 1:07:49.278
Can't you do this
for your brother, please?

1:07:49.361 --> 1:07:50.612
-W-- I--
-Raymond?

1:07:50.696 --> 1:07:52.739
I mean, Simon, do you wanna see the body?

1:07:53.407 --> 1:07:56.159
-Okay.
-He did not want this.

1:07:57.035 --> 1:07:58.287
Let us take a look first.

1:08:00.664 --> 1:08:01.665
Mr. Canfield.

1:08:03.083 --> 1:08:04.751
Okay. Jonas.

1:08:12.092 --> 1:08:13.135
Oh, my God.

1:08:15.637 --> 1:08:16.805
He's facedown.

1:08:18.432 --> 1:08:19.558
Why is he facedown?

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:22.227
It's what he requested,
but he did not want anyone to know.

1:08:22.310 --> 1:08:24.313
That's why I was hoping
not to open the casket.

1:08:24.395 --> 1:08:26.273
He was very adamant about this.

1:08:26.356 --> 1:08:28.609
Well, what does it mean, Reverend West?

1:08:29.151 --> 1:08:30.152
I have no idea.

1:08:30.234 --> 1:08:32.946
It's some bullshit attempt
to make amends with the universe.

1:08:33.029 --> 1:08:36.992
You know, some final gasp
at hokey atonement.

1:08:37.743 --> 1:08:39.578
-We see through you, Harris!
-Shut up, Ray.

1:08:39.661 --> 1:08:42.663
-Lucia, did you know about this?
-No, it's stupid.

1:08:43.247 --> 1:08:45.626
-Let's turn him over.
-We cannot do that.

1:08:45.709 --> 1:08:47.377
He's dead. Flip him over.

1:08:47.461 --> 1:08:51.423
Lucia. Ju-- Let the boy take a look.
Then we'll proceed, okay?

1:09:00.057 --> 1:09:01.475
I can't really see him.

1:09:03.894 --> 1:09:04.895
Okay.

1:09:04.978 --> 1:09:05.979
W-- No--

1:09:11.193 --> 1:09:12.486
He looks uncomfortable.

1:09:12.569 --> 1:09:14.363
Okay. Enough.

1:09:14.446 --> 1:09:16.156
Jesus, he's pathetic.

1:09:17.533 --> 1:09:19.701
You know, in a way, it makes sense.

1:09:19.785 --> 1:09:22.287
It's the way he lived his whole life,
facedown like a loser.

1:09:22.371 --> 1:09:24.206
-Don't talk about him like that.
-He is a loser.

1:09:24.288 --> 1:09:27.209
-And everything he touched turned to shit.
-Shut up! Shut up, Ray!

1:09:27.292 --> 1:09:29.545
Come on! You fucking hated him, Raymond.

1:09:29.627 --> 1:09:31.255
-And he deserved to be hated.
-Stop it!

1:09:31.337 --> 1:09:32.881
-What will it take for you to say it?
-Shut up!

1:09:32.965 --> 1:09:34.341
Why can't you say it? Fuck him!

1:09:34.424 --> 1:09:36.176
-Shut the fuck up, Ray!
-Fuck our father!

1:09:36.260 --> 1:09:38.636
-He fucked your wife, Raymond.
-Ray, no!

1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:41.223
And the boy you thought was your son
was his son.

1:09:41.305 --> 1:09:43.975
-How's that make you--
-Stop!

1:09:44.059 --> 1:09:46.435
-Come on, Raymond.
-Hey. Come on.

1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:49.106
Raymond. Let him go.

1:10:33.817 --> 1:10:36.486
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1:10:36.570 --> 1:10:37.905
hallowed be thy name.

1:10:37.988 --> 1:10:39.448
Thy kingdom come,

1:10:39.531 --> 1:10:42.201
thy will be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1:10:42.701 --> 1:10:46.496
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:49.082
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us.

1:10:49.166 --> 1:10:52.503
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1:10:52.586 --> 1:10:53.587
Amen.

1:10:55.631 --> 1:10:59.927
Harris wanted me to encourage anybody
who wanted to speak.

1:11:02.179 --> 1:11:03.388
"No pressure," he said.

1:11:08.644 --> 1:11:09.645
Ray?

1:11:10.687 --> 1:11:11.688
No.

1:11:15.150 --> 1:11:16.527
-Lucia?
-No.

1:11:19.071 --> 1:11:20.280
Raymond?

1:12:27.139 --> 1:12:28.140
Raymond.

1:12:28.724 --> 1:12:31.351
-Stay!
-Raymond. It's all right. I'll get him.

1:12:31.852 --> 1:12:33.395
Raymond. Come on.

1:12:34.771 --> 1:12:35.856
What are you doing?

1:12:36.857 --> 1:12:37.858
Raymond!

1:12:39.776 --> 1:12:40.777
Raymond.

1:12:40.861 --> 1:12:42.613
-Let's talk.
-Oh, my God.

1:12:43.947 --> 1:12:45.365
-Raymond.
-No!

1:12:45.449 --> 1:12:47.534
No. Stop!

1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:36.792
We must report this, West. To the police.

1:13:36.875 --> 1:13:39.336
No. Look, it's gonna be a whole ordeal.

1:13:39.419 --> 1:13:42.172
Just be practical, my friend.
The outcome's the same.

1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:45.884
Ray.

1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:47.970
Say your goodbyes, Ray.

1:13:49.304 --> 1:13:50.806
You will never regret it.

1:14:13.287 --> 1:14:16.164
Oh, fuck me. Now what?

1:17:37.533 --> 1:17:38.909
Rest in peace, Harris.

1:17:42.621 --> 1:17:48.460
Leave behind fear, hope,
anger, spilled milk.

1:17:49.753 --> 1:17:51.004
Take silence only.

1:17:52.548 --> 1:17:56.301
Sky, wind. Sunrise after the rain.

1:17:59.263 --> 1:18:00.472
Forget the rest.

1:18:03.851 --> 1:18:04.977
Sleep, Harris.

1:18:10.023 --> 1:18:11.441
Rest from yourself.

1:18:24.872 --> 1:18:25.914
Take care.

1:18:28.625 --> 1:18:31.461
Your father left you a letter
to be delivered at this moment.

1:18:35.924 --> 1:18:37.759
I'm sorry, sir. That's the wrong one.

1:18:49.688 --> 1:18:50.731
Thank you.

1:19:18.467 --> 1:19:22.846
Okay, this stuff is going to the shed
for charity.

1:19:22.930 --> 1:19:25.057
This other stuff is going to the garbage.

1:19:25.974 --> 1:19:30.145
After that, I'll make up a bed for you,
and you are gonna sleep like a king.

1:19:46.286 --> 1:19:47.871
Hey, folks.

1:19:48.497 --> 1:19:50.040
I'll have a Corona.

1:19:50.123 --> 1:19:52.584
Okay. And for you, sir?

1:19:52.668 --> 1:19:56.380
I will have a coffee, black,
and a cherry pie, warm.

1:19:56.463 --> 1:19:58.340
-You want ice cream with that?
-Yeah.

1:19:58.423 --> 1:19:59.591
And for dessert?

1:20:01.802 --> 1:20:02.845
You don't drink?

1:20:02.928 --> 1:20:06.557
No, I'm an addict. But enough about me.

1:20:09.268 --> 1:20:12.229
No, I was a heroin addict for three years.
It wasn't pretty.

1:20:13.021 --> 1:20:15.816
My brother said that one of the things
he needed to do to stay clean

1:20:15.899 --> 1:20:17.609
was finding new sources of pleasure.

1:20:18.068 --> 1:20:20.404
Because the drugs, for better or worse,
were pleasure.

1:20:21.321 --> 1:20:22.489
Yeah. Well, that's true.

1:20:22.573 --> 1:20:25.534
I mean, when that drug
first hits your body,

1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:28.328
there's nothing like it.

1:20:29.079 --> 1:20:31.748
You know the sound of
nails on a chalkboard?

1:20:32.457 --> 1:20:35.169
Heroin is that sound stopping.

1:20:35.252 --> 1:20:39.798
It's all the pain in your body,
the little rattle in your head, it's gone.

1:20:39.882 --> 1:20:43.552
It's just the numbing of all that feeling.
That's the pleasure.

1:20:44.678 --> 1:20:46.680
So, now pleasure's more muted, you know.

1:20:47.472 --> 1:20:52.853
There's food. Sex. Not bad. Humor.

1:20:52.936 --> 1:20:55.981
You know, just all the normal things
that bring people pleasure.

1:20:56.064 --> 1:20:57.065
Music.

1:20:59.735 --> 1:21:01.403
When it's not bringing me pain.

1:21:02.946 --> 1:21:08.619
Nothing makes me happier
than listening to jazz. It's a drug.

1:21:09.453 --> 1:21:12.873
Listening more than playing?
You sounded pretty good back there.

1:21:13.457 --> 1:21:15.751
-For a white boy.
-You're not a boy.

1:21:18.170 --> 1:21:19.463
You know jazz?

1:21:19.546 --> 1:21:21.548
No. But I like it.

1:21:22.799 --> 1:21:23.800
My father used to say

1:21:23.884 --> 1:21:29.306
that jazz was just Negro tribal music
promoted by Jews to make cash.

1:21:30.474 --> 1:21:33.101
-Harris said that?
-Yeah, he has lots of winners.

1:21:33.185 --> 1:21:35.062
"Work is not something you should enjoy.

1:21:36.104 --> 1:21:37.397
If you had any real talent,

1:21:37.481 --> 1:21:40.025
it'd be written
all over your white-trash face."

1:21:41.109 --> 1:21:42.110
Charming.

1:21:43.737 --> 1:21:47.866
The things he said,
they're like a weight on my chest.

1:21:47.950 --> 1:21:52.663
You know, it's like I'd be playing,
and in between phrases, I can feel my…

1:21:54.414 --> 1:21:56.917
tank's not filling up, you know,
from the weight.

1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.670
My whole life,
just tried not to get crushed.

1:22:00.295 --> 1:22:01.922
Playing back there at the cemetery,

1:22:02.005 --> 1:22:06.510
that's not like a real gig
with other musicians.

1:22:06.593 --> 1:22:09.930
That's when the fear rears its ugly head.

1:22:10.013 --> 1:22:11.098
Fear of what?

1:22:12.224 --> 1:22:13.392
Sounding like crap.

1:22:17.896 --> 1:22:18.939
Thanks.

1:22:21.191 --> 1:22:22.734
Appreciate it. Yeah, I got ya.

1:22:24.778 --> 1:22:26.280
You have a picture of your wife?

1:22:27.573 --> 1:22:28.574
Yeah.

1:22:41.670 --> 1:22:44.715
Wow. She was beautiful.

1:22:47.593 --> 1:22:52.181
So, when you're done eating,
we're gonna go get you high.

1:23:27.049 --> 1:23:30.344
I'm finished with the shed boxes.
You show me where the dumpster is?

1:23:30.427 --> 1:23:31.720
Dinner first.

1:23:32.221 --> 1:23:34.348
Well,
I'd rather get it over and done with.

1:23:48.654 --> 1:23:50.239
That was weird today.

1:23:50.322 --> 1:23:51.490
Don't be rude.

1:23:53.784 --> 1:23:54.952
Thank you.

1:24:05.754 --> 1:24:08.048
Cuckoo.

1:25:35.636 --> 1:25:37.054
Did you love him?

1:25:45.771 --> 1:25:48.815
He was a horny 67-year-old.

1:25:49.775 --> 1:25:52.945
And I was in a bad marriage and sad.

1:25:54.446 --> 1:25:57.866
And he gave me attention.
And he made me laugh.

1:26:00.577 --> 1:26:04.957
He was a bad father to you,
a good father to Simon.

1:26:06.416 --> 1:26:11.213
He was a bad lover to your moms.
He was a good lover to me.

1:26:12.256 --> 1:26:15.843
He loved women,
but he didn't understand them.

1:26:17.010 --> 1:26:20.013
He was a racist who liked everyone.

1:26:22.599 --> 1:26:24.476
He ate 10,000 meals

1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:29.898
and slept 10,000 nights
with his dreams and his nightmares.

1:26:31.191 --> 1:26:35.195
He had a hundred jobs
and no money in the end.

1:26:37.030 --> 1:26:43.287
He wanted to understand the world,
life, everything.

1:26:43.370 --> 1:26:46.874
But no. Who can?

1:26:49.209 --> 1:26:51.128
He was a speck of dust.

1:27:16.069 --> 1:27:17.237
What does it mean?

1:27:20.616 --> 1:27:22.075
Onwards.

1:28:29.268 --> 1:28:30.727
The real thing is better.

1:31:14.266 --> 1:31:16.059
You know what? I think I'm gonna walk.

1:31:16.894 --> 1:31:17.978
Where to?

1:31:18.061 --> 1:31:20.314
I don't know.
I was just gonna walk, you know?

1:31:21.023 --> 1:31:22.858
-You want company?
-It's all right.

1:31:24.151 --> 1:31:25.903
Do you even know your way around here?

1:31:27.070 --> 1:31:28.363
I'll be fine.

1:31:28.447 --> 1:31:29.615
What's going on?

1:31:30.449 --> 1:31:31.575
Nothing, you know.

1:31:32.201 --> 1:31:35.204
Just been a long day and I'm done.

1:31:35.287 --> 1:31:37.039
-You're done?
-Yeah.

1:31:37.122 --> 1:31:40.209
Look, don't be weird. Just--

1:31:40.292 --> 1:31:43.086
Hey!

1:31:45.255 --> 1:31:46.465
What the hell happened?

1:31:47.132 --> 1:31:50.093
Did I say something?
Clear it up for me, and I'll walk away.

1:31:50.177 --> 1:31:52.095
-Look, it's not about you.
-What'd I do?

1:31:52.179 --> 1:31:54.890
Look, I'm not your pet project,
Nurse Kiera.

1:31:57.184 --> 1:31:58.435
I'm such an idiot.

1:32:00.479 --> 1:32:04.107
You know what?
People tell you who they are right away.

1:32:04.608 --> 1:32:08.695
My first impression was the right one.
You're a prick.

1:32:08.779 --> 1:32:10.280
Well, you're right about that.

1:32:42.563 --> 1:32:43.647
Shit.

1:32:43.730 --> 1:32:45.357
Hey! Shit!

1:32:50.153 --> 1:32:51.154
Hey!

1:32:58.412 --> 1:32:59.580
Oh, fuck.

1:32:59.663 --> 1:33:00.664
Hold it!

1:33:01.665 --> 1:33:02.666
Shit!

1:33:05.669 --> 1:33:06.837
Just hold on.

1:33:09.590 --> 1:33:12.301
Can I talk to you, please?

1:33:14.803 --> 1:33:16.972
Kiera, just give me two seconds,
all right?

1:33:17.055 --> 1:33:19.224
Can you roll down the window for-- J--

1:33:19.308 --> 1:33:21.018
No, hey!

1:33:21.101 --> 1:33:23.145
Please, just two seconds, all right?

1:33:23.979 --> 1:33:25.856
I-- Oh, f--

1:33:33.697 --> 1:33:35.282
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

1:33:35.908 --> 1:33:37.242
You sure?

1:33:37.326 --> 1:33:38.619
I'm fine, thanks.

1:33:40.287 --> 1:33:41.288
You know this guy?

1:33:42.915 --> 1:33:43.916
Yeah.

1:33:46.877 --> 1:33:47.878
He's cute.

1:34:12.361 --> 1:34:13.362
Fuck you.

1:34:47.980 --> 1:34:52.860
Raymond, I regret
that I caused you so much pain.

1:34:53.569 --> 1:34:58.323
I was in a lot of pain myself,
but I've heard that's no excuse.

1:34:58.866 --> 1:35:03.453
It was exhausting work being a father,
even a bad father.

1:35:04.121 --> 1:35:05.664
Find a way to forgive me.

1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:11.753
One more thing.
Your brother Ray, is not my son.

1:35:12.671 --> 1:35:14.715
His mother was already pregnant

1:35:14.798 --> 1:35:17.593
but didn't know it
when she and I started up.

1:35:18.594 --> 1:35:22.181
We went along with it
because I loved her, I thought.

1:35:22.973 --> 1:35:26.518
So, in a way, he's not even your brother,
I suppose.

1:35:27.769 --> 1:35:31.648
Do with that information what you will.
I trust you.

1:35:32.191 --> 1:35:36.195
Your father, Benjamin Reed Harris III.

1:36:00.135 --> 1:36:05.474
Ray, you were a golden boy.
I never knew what to do with you.

1:36:06.183 --> 1:36:10.646
Sincerely, Benjamin Reed Harris III.

1:37:00.028 --> 1:37:02.781
She invited me to stay a few days
and I'm going to.

1:37:02.865 --> 1:37:04.408
So, you take the truck.

1:37:04.491 --> 1:37:07.286
Wait, are you sure?
I mean, I can take the bus.

1:37:07.369 --> 1:37:09.246
Yeah. I'll pick it up from your house
this weekend.

1:37:09.329 --> 1:37:10.330
All right.

1:37:16.628 --> 1:37:19.339
Did you and Lucia…

1:37:21.425 --> 1:37:22.426
What?

1:37:23.385 --> 1:37:24.595
What, what?

1:37:25.470 --> 1:37:27.848
-Oh, my God.
-Just cut the shit, Ray.

1:37:27.931 --> 1:37:29.850
Holy shit.

1:37:31.310 --> 1:37:34.354
You had sexual intercourse
with his woman, bro!

1:37:34.438 --> 1:37:36.231
Why do you have to point everything out?

1:37:36.315 --> 1:37:38.442
Why can't you let silence
speak for itself?

1:37:39.067 --> 1:37:40.903
Where would the fun be in that, huh?

1:37:42.946 --> 1:37:48.994
-Now his son could be your son.
-Jesus! Fuck.

1:37:57.878 --> 1:37:59.087
Listen, you know…

1:38:02.466 --> 1:38:04.468
thank you for making me
come to this thing.

1:38:07.554 --> 1:38:08.764
Is this where we hug?

1:38:10.265 --> 1:38:11.767
-Hug this.
-Hug this!

1:38:16.605 --> 1:38:17.731
Hey.

1:38:21.985 --> 1:38:23.654
We never really knew him, did we?

1:38:29.409 --> 1:38:30.661
Let's talk this weekend.

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:34.081
Yeah.
