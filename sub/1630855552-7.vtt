It really was Deer Lady.

21:58.937 --> 22:01.943
-I'm not lying about that.
-I know, I know.

22:02.010 --> 22:05.783
It's not that.
It's about Daniel.

22:08.222 --> 22:09.758
Oh.

22:11.027 --> 22:12.931
Um...

22:13.666 --> 22:17.473
What... What did you do?

22:22.785 --> 22:23.854
[gasps]

22:23.920 --> 22:25.991
We got to do something.
For Cookie.

22:26.760 --> 22:30.066
Okay. I'll make another
appointment with Larry.

22:30.132 --> 22:32.236
No. She's watching us.

22:32.303 --> 22:33.472
Like, a lot.

22:33.540 --> 22:36.078
[laughs] Oh, my God.

22:36.144 --> 22:37.714
Prove it.

22:41.188 --> 22:43.091
[Rita groans]

22:44.528 --> 22:47.099
Ho-lah. Ee-yah.

22:48.903 --> 22:51.742
Ho-lah. Ee-yah.

22:51.809 --> 22:52.978
Ho-lah.

22:53.045 --> 22:54.549
Ee-yah.

22:54.615 --> 22:55.817
Ho-lah. Ee-yah.

22:55.884 --> 22:57.587
-Ho-lah. Ee-yah.
-[quietly] Stop it.

22:57.654 --> 23:00.026
-Ho-lah. Ee-yah.
-Stop it.

23:00.092 --> 23:01.796
Like dat.

23:02.564 --> 23:05.102
It's so fucked-up
when you do it. Ugh.

23:05.904 --> 23:08.943
Okay, what do we need to do?

23:20.466 --> 23:22.704
[Rita sighs]

23:24.073 --> 23:25.610
So, what is this?

23:27.815 --> 23:31.187
We're gonna say
"We love you" to our sister

23:31.254 --> 23:34.595
and... let her know she can go.

23:34.661 --> 23:36.431
We never really did that.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.872
And please stop
watching over us so hard.

23:39.938 --> 23:41.107
Shit.

23:42.143 --> 23:44.681
I thought we could
send this with her.

23:45.449 --> 23:47.252
[Natalie]
Oh, I remember that.

23:47.319 --> 23:48.723
[chuckles]

23:48.789 --> 23:51.829
So, what do we do?
Just toss it in?

23:51.896 --> 23:54.100
[Rita]
I think we should say something.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.906
[Bev]
I'll say it.

23:56.972 --> 23:58.876
Cookie...

23:58.943 --> 24:01.882
you hot, vivacious, main bitch.

24:02.985 --> 24:05.791
The world isn't the same
without you.

24:05.857 --> 24:08.529
You weren't perfect, but...

24:10.299 --> 24:12.136
...you were fucking cool
as hell.

24:12.203 --> 24:13.471
Mm.

24:14.775 --> 24:17.614
No one really had my back
like you did.

24:19.350 --> 24:20.620
[sniffles]

24:21.354 --> 24:24.226
These two bitches come
pretty close, though.

24:25.897 --> 24:26.766
[sighs]

24:26.833 --> 24:30.172
Till we meet in the next one.

24:42.196 --> 24:43.666
[Rita] Good words, Bev.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.438
-[Natalie] Aho.
-[Rita] Aho.

24:46.506 --> 24:48.709
[groans] Like dat.

24:48.776 --> 24:50.379
-Sick.
-[chuckling]

24:50.445 --> 24:52.650
Sick.

24:54.722 --> 24:56.592
So, that's it?

24:59.030 --> 25:01.702
I think so.

25:02.436 --> 25:04.107
[Natalie]
Cool.

25:04.173 --> 25:05.610
Yeah.

25:05.677 --> 25:07.246
Feels good.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.520
Yeah.

25:15.462 --> 25:17.834
I think I'm gonna take that job.

25:19.604 --> 25:21.274
Yeah.

25:23.011 --> 25:24.881
-Give me your phone.
-For what?

25:24.948 --> 25:26.417
Tinder profile.
I'm gonna make you one.

25:26.484 --> 25:27.788
No.

25:27.854 --> 25:30.527
[chuckles]
Is Bear gonna go with you?

25:30.593 --> 25:33.498
It's up to him.
He's cooking now.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.269
-Recipes.
-Mm.

25:35.336 --> 25:37.439
Well, we'll look after him
if he stays.

25:37.507 --> 25:39.444
Yeah, like hawks
looking after...

25:39.512 --> 25:41.214
I don't know,
what do hawks eat?

25:41.281 --> 25:43.653
Um, smaller birds?

25:43.719 --> 25:45.122
You're not eating him.

25:45.189 --> 25:47.259
Okay, we'll look after him
like spirits.

25:47.326 --> 25:49.564
Always watching,
even when you're snagging.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.136
No. Bear's not snagging.

25:54.741 --> 25:56.377
Got to watch out for Elora, too.
