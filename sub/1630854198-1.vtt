02:03.200 --> 02:04.450
Calm down!

02:28.017 --> 02:28.934
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.435
Calm down. Calm down.

02:30.518 --> 02:34.689
Relax. You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

02:34.773 --> 02:36.691
You're okay.

02:38.944 --> 02:40.362
Look at me.

02:42.031 --> 02:45.408
Thank God.
I was getting so worried.

02:46.451 --> 02:48.245
Vitals clear.

02:51.290 --> 02:54.500
-You're not doing
anything crazy, are you?

02:56.962 --> 02:59.965
Am I gonna do anything crazy?
I don't know.

03:01.424 --> 03:03.844
-Do you remember
how you got here?

03:06.847 --> 03:08.307
No.

03:08.390 --> 03:11.684
-Do you remember
being in a car accident?

03:13.395 --> 03:14.562
-No.

03:14.646 --> 03:19.734
-Do you remember me asking
you the same questions yesterday?

03:26.574 --> 03:31.246
You are suffering from
post-traumatic amnesia.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.833
Can you tell me your name?

03:41.382 --> 03:43.508
-Of course I can.

03:46.387 --> 03:48.305
- My
- Hm-mm?

03:48.389 --> 03:49.973
What is it?

03:51.808 --> 03:53.476
John.

03:54.811 --> 03:58.690
-Your name is Cain.
John Cain.

03:58.773 --> 04:03.112
Don't worry. Everything
will come back. Okay?

04:05.406 --> 04:08.117
We are doing everything we can.

04:08.200 --> 04:12.287
The best thing for you now
just to relax.

04:12.371 --> 04:14.456
-I'll be right here.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.501
-I'm sorry, but

04:20.545 --> 04:22.131
Who are you?

04:24.549 --> 04:27.344
I'm your wife.

04:27.428 --> 04:30.097
-You're my wife?

04:30.180 --> 04:33.183
Just try to relax. Okay?

04:35.727 --> 04:38.397
-What-what are you doing?
What are you doing?

04:38.480 --> 04:41.858
-Isotonic saline
to cope with your blood loss,

04:41.942 --> 04:44.361
along with morphine
for the pain.

04:45.362 --> 04:47.239
You will love it.

04:49.408 --> 04:51.410
Can we take these
off now, please?

05:14.349 --> 05:16.143
-It's a fucking disaster.

05:33.202 --> 05:36.205
Oof!

05:37.289 --> 05:40.459
Is it Cain?

05:40.542 --> 05:44.379
Not sure.
The body's too burnt to tell.

05:44.463 --> 05:46.131
We're pulling dental.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.799
We'll get it soon.

05:47.882 --> 05:49.551
-Yeah.

05:55.307 --> 05:56.599
What the hell is this?

05:56.682 --> 05:59.561
-A way down to the city
electrical conduit tunnel.

05:59.644 --> 06:02.105
This party took
months to plan. Maybe years.

06:02.189 --> 06:05.192
Did any of you know about this? - No, sir.

06:05.275 --> 06:08.362
-Didn't? Great job.
Great fucking job!

06:08.445 --> 06:10.239
I oughta fire all of you!

06:10.322 --> 06:11.590
-What do you want us
to do about this?

06:11.614 --> 06:13.783
-I want you to find
the motherfucker!

06:16.078 --> 06:18.788
I'm sorry.

06:18.871 --> 06:21.291
-Things have been difficult.

06:21.375 --> 06:24.710
It just would have been nice
to know what you were up to.

06:24.794 --> 06:28.549
-How am I supposed to know that?
I don't even know who I am.

06:28.631 --> 06:31.801
I mean, do I have a birthday?
Do I have parents?

06:31.884 --> 06:35.138
-Dr. Garza said everything
will come back eventually.

06:35.222 --> 06:38.267
Just try to relax, okay?

06:47.025 --> 06:50.320
December 2nd, 1972.

06:50.404 --> 06:53.031
You were born
in Boulder, Colorado.

06:54.657 --> 06:57.785
Your father's name is
Ernie. He's in France,

06:57.869 --> 06:59.704
finally taking
his European vacation.

07:00.955 --> 07:05.294
I spoke to him last night.
He's doing his best to get here.

07:09.005 --> 07:10.424
-My mother?

07:16.388 --> 07:18.764
-It's just me and you, Cain.

07:19.974 --> 07:21.976
It's just us.

07:28.609 --> 07:30.527
-Where's your ring?

07:30.611 --> 07:33.196
There he is.

07:35.657 --> 07:37.242
-How you doin', buddy?

07:37.326 --> 07:39.702
Cain, this is Eddie.

07:39.785 --> 07:41.580
Do you remember him?

07:44.249 --> 07:48.170
-I can't say that I do. No.

07:50.380 --> 07:54.343
-Yeah, Anna told me you got
a memory thing going on.

07:54.426 --> 07:57.304
No progress?
- No.

08:02.058 --> 08:04.018
-How do I know you?

08:08.440 --> 08:11.360
-You're one fucked-up dude,
you know?

08:11.443 --> 08:13.986
I didn't realize
it was this bad.

08:17.865 --> 08:22.870
On any other day, you're usually
the sharpest guy in the room.

08:27.334 --> 08:30.962
Okay. Let me introduce
myself again.

08:31.045 --> 08:34.508
I'm Eddie.
Cain, nice to meet you.

08:37.719 --> 08:39.721
You're like a brother to me.

08:39.804 --> 08:41.973
And you better goddamn
believe that I'm gonna do

08:42.056 --> 08:45.810
whatever it takes to make
sure that you're alright.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.145
You know why?

08:49.981 --> 08:51.983
'Cause you owe me money.

08:54.277 --> 08:56.862
Like five dollars
from a poker game.

09:05.330 --> 09:09.334
- How are you?
- Good.

09:09.418 --> 09:12.920
-Okay, things will start
looking up soon, Cain.

09:13.004 --> 09:16.675
I got the best of the best
coming here to help you out.

09:16.758 --> 09:20.094
You know? I'll get you
back to normal

09:20.178 --> 09:22.723
so you can remember everything
you need to remember

09:22.805 --> 09:25.767
in no time at all. I promise.

09:25.850 --> 09:27.519
Can I speak to you for a moment?

09:27.602 --> 09:30.731
-Actually, I should get going,
but I'll call you later.

09:30.813 --> 09:32.524
My friend.

09:38.488 --> 09:40.365
Excuse me!

09:52.544 --> 09:56.631
-He seems fucked.
Not what I paid for.

09:58.341 --> 10:01.344
-I already told you.
He's not ready.

10:01.428 --> 10:04.306
-Time's up, Garza.
Don't think too much.

10:04.389 --> 10:07.975
Don't hesitate.
Just do as you were told.

10:08.059 --> 10:09.269
-Listen, please!

10:14.357 --> 10:16.485
I need that case.

10:20.112 --> 10:22.824
So I thought I'd pay you
a visit to remind you

10:22.907 --> 10:25.702
that all our lives
are depending on this.

10:25.786 --> 10:28.913
Just just remember one thing.

10:29.955 --> 10:32.834
Who loves you?

10:32.917 --> 10:35.002
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

10:35.086 --> 10:37.922
I want you to say it.
Who loves you?

10:42.385 --> 10:43.928
-Eddie loves me.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.097
-Claro, cabrón!

10:46.180 --> 10:48.140
I love this guy.

10:48.224 --> 10:49.601
I know.

10:49.684 --> 10:54.188
-I love you so much I even
send you hearts in our texts.

11:00.069 --> 11:02.364
-I'm not in the mood, Eddie.

11:03.490 --> 11:07.494
-Okay. Who's texting you
right now?

11:10.288 --> 11:13.249
Someone who loves you.

11:14.917 --> 11:16.837
Ves, cabrón?

11:20.465 --> 11:23.343
We tried your way
with this fucking drug,

11:23.426 --> 11:25.219
but it's obviously not working.

11:25.303 --> 11:27.597
So now you're going to use
anything and everything

11:27.681 --> 11:30.308
until his fucking memory
comes back!

11:43.488 --> 11:45.072
That's your boy?

11:51.746 --> 11:54.416
So pretty.

11:54.499 --> 11:58.252
Don't worry, Garza.
I won't touch him.

12:00.797 --> 12:03.425
You know that's not my style.

12:06.344 --> 12:09.138
My style is way colder
than that.

12:12.183 --> 12:15.227
I'd rather kill his dad
right now.

12:15.311 --> 12:17.939
This little guy
won't have a chance.

12:18.022 --> 12:23.277
Sin papa, he will grow
up loveless and confused.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.532
He'll try to sell drugs,
but quickly he will realize

12:27.616 --> 12:29.743
that drugs
don't make much money.

12:29.826 --> 12:34.623
So he'll turn to worse ways
to make money.

12:34.706 --> 12:39.794
And he'll cry himself
to sleep every night

12:39.878 --> 12:45.634
because he and his mom
can't afford heat or food.

12:47.051 --> 12:49.721
But most of all,
this little guy will cry

12:49.804 --> 12:52.264
because he won't
be able to figure out

12:52.348 --> 12:55.309
why his father disappeared.

12:55.393 --> 13:00.398
Why his father
didn't love him enough

13:00.482 --> 13:02.984
to leave a fucking note

13:05.236 --> 13:07.822
before he disappeared.

13:16.330 --> 13:19.000
Just do as you were told.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.835
Let's go.

13:27.550 --> 13:31.012
- Here.
- No, I got

13:31.095 --> 13:33.097
Let me help you.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.151
-You're very pretty.

13:52.283 --> 13:54.368
You don't remember anything?

13:57.956 --> 13:59.958
-Yeah.

14:00.041 --> 14:03.795
I remember hospital food
tastes like shit.

14:03.878 --> 14:06.965
Wow. I remember that.

14:07.048 --> 14:09.425
-You've never let me do this.

14:09.509 --> 14:12.762
-What? Feed me?
Why would I?

14:12.846 --> 14:14.681
-First time.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.149
I want to know what happened.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.151
How it happened.

14:32.907 --> 14:35.326
You've been gone for days.

14:36.494 --> 14:38.496
I thought

14:39.914 --> 14:43.250
I thought maybe
you changed your mind.

14:43.334 --> 14:46.170
-Change my
Why would I change?

14:46.253 --> 14:48.339
Ready to move around?

14:54.012 --> 14:55.471
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:55.555 --> 14:57.431
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

14:57.515 --> 15:00.643
Okay, breathe and take it slow.

15:00.727 --> 15:02.520
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:02.604 --> 15:04.355
Your feet first.
- Oh, man.

15:04.438 --> 15:07.358
Okay. Breathe.

15:07.441 --> 15:09.778
Okay.

15:09.861 --> 15:12.446
Okay, do you feel nauseous?
- I'm fine.

15:12.530 --> 15:17.201
-It's the saline, okay?
Sometimes it has that effect.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.703
Good, Cain.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.956
Okay. Okay.

15:47.649 --> 15:49.316
How are you feeling?

15:49.400 --> 15:53.113
- Good. Time for tests?
- No.

16:11.422 --> 16:13.174
-Que pasa, Doctor.

16:13.257 --> 16:15.259
What do you mean by that?

16:31.275 --> 16:33.277
Who the fuck am I?

16:48.209 --> 16:50.437
If you make a sound, I'll put
a fucking hole in your head.

16:50.461 --> 16:51.880
Do you hear me?

17:10.272 --> 17:11.709
Now you better tell me
what the hell's going on.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.152
-This is only gonna
make things worse.

17:14.235 --> 17:15.611
-What things?

17:15.695 --> 17:17.529
-These are dangerous people. Okay?

17:18.907 --> 17:21.492
It's not just them
you gotta worry about.

17:23.077 --> 17:25.496
-Yeah? Does that include you?

17:26.831 --> 17:27.832
Get in.

17:34.172 --> 17:37.424
- You need to understand this.
- I understood completely.

17:37.508 --> 17:39.384
You're not my wife.

18:16.089 --> 18:18.340
Fuck!

18:18.423 --> 18:20.009
He's in the elevator.

19:32.748 --> 19:34.625
-Shit.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.460
We're not moving.

19:45.303 --> 19:47.180
What are you doing?

19:47.263 --> 19:49.473
I don't know.

19:51.184 --> 19:53.685
I have no clue.

20:03.863 --> 20:07.158
-Main elevator is frozen.
They ain't going nowhere.

20:22.924 --> 20:24.800
-We can go up.

20:49.491 --> 20:51.285
-Chinga.

21:06.259 --> 21:08.510
Cain

21:10.471 --> 21:13.141
I just wanna talk.

21:13.224 --> 21:16.978
-Yeah, you should have
thought about that approach first.

21:17.061 --> 21:19.521
-Where are you, Cain?

21:19.604 --> 21:22.275
-What do you want from me?

21:22.358 --> 21:24.902
-You have something of mine.

21:24.986 --> 21:26.778
-Is that so?

21:27.947 --> 21:31.075
You don't want to do this, man.

21:31.159 --> 21:34.078
You have no idea
who the other players are.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.914
This runs far deeper
than you can imagine.

21:42.336 --> 21:45.714
Cain, where is it?

21:48.050 --> 21:49.051
Cain!

21:51.595 --> 21:54.515
- Cain!
- Go fuck yourself, Eddie.

22:20.458 --> 22:24.378
First guy to find him
gets a serious fucking raise.

22:28.549 --> 22:30.634
Pull up the camera feeds.

23:08.297 --> 23:10.484
-I know you don't want to,
but you need to listen to me.

23:10.508 --> 23:12.301
-Sit.

23:12.385 --> 23:14.845
-Can we just talk for a second? -Sit down.

23:17.390 --> 23:18.658
I want you to
tell me everything.

23:18.682 --> 23:20.601
Everything, from the beginning.

23:20.684 --> 23:22.520
- I don't know the details.
- Why am I here?

23:22.603 --> 23:24.855
-You and Eddie, you're close.

23:24.938 --> 23:27.191
You close
all kinds of deals together.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.318
He even treated you like family,

23:29.402 --> 23:30.753
and that doesn't happen
with him often.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.364
But then, then you disappeared.
- Hands here.

23:34.698 --> 23:36.117
And now we're here.

23:36.200 --> 23:41.038
-So we're like what?
Like like weapons dealers?

23:42.582 --> 23:44.542
-Drugs.

23:44.625 --> 23:46.168
-I'm a drug dealer?

23:47.461 --> 23:50.590
-More than that.
You work with Eddie.

23:50.672 --> 23:54.051
- In the cartel?
- Yeah, in the cartel.

24:02.143 --> 24:04.437
-Holy shit.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.355
Holy shit.

24:06.439 --> 24:08.065
- Yes.
- Oh, fuck.

24:08.149 --> 24:09.442
I could have been a lawyer.

24:09.525 --> 24:10.835
I could have been
a football player.

24:10.859 --> 24:12.236
I could have been
a fucking carney.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.155
I could have worked
in the carnival, but no.

24:14.238 --> 24:17.199
I have to wake up and be
a fucking cartel member?

24:17.283 --> 24:18.576
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:18.659 --> 24:21.495
-Cain, think.
Where is it?

24:21.579 --> 24:24.624
-Where is what?! I don't
know what you're talking about!

24:24.706 --> 24:26.417
I don't remember anything!

24:26.500 --> 24:27.727
I don't even know
if I believe you!

24:27.751 --> 24:31.464
-I'm pretty sure you know.
I'm not bullshitting you!

24:31.547 --> 24:33.757
Your gut's gotta be
telling you something.

24:35.343 --> 24:37.010
Not about you and Eddie.

24:39.804 --> 24:43.517
This us

24:44.518 --> 24:46.187
This is real.

24:57.156 --> 25:00.368
-I do remember
that there was somebody.

25:00.451 --> 25:02.662
I'm starting to put together
the bits and pieces,

25:02.744 --> 25:03.954
and it was not you.

25:04.037 --> 25:06.957
-Your mind's not
processing right now, Cain.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.251
- No. No. No.
- You're not yourself.

25:09.335 --> 25:10.794
It's all gonna hit you.

25:11.962 --> 25:14.590
And when it does,
you're gonna feel awful.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.806
You need to trust me.

25:29.438 --> 25:32.107
This wasn't my choice.

25:32.191 --> 25:34.901
This is not how
I wanted it to play out.

25:34.985 --> 25:37.946
Eddie thought that if you
woke up and saw me by your side,

25:38.029 --> 25:40.991
that you'd tell me everything.

25:41.074 --> 25:42.660
You need to trust me.

25:42.743 --> 25:45.413
-No. No.

25:45.496 --> 25:47.998
No, I'm gonna go find
some answers for myself.

26:50.686 --> 26:52.145
Shit!

27:14.752 --> 27:16.796
There's gotta
be something in here.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.784
John Cain.

28:28.701 --> 28:30.243
Motherfucker.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.171
Alright. Bring it.

28:48.637 --> 28:49.805
Come on.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.314
Take it. Take it!

30:00.542 --> 30:03.420
-Oh my god, Mr. Cain, what
are you doing out of your room?

30:03.504 --> 30:04.505
Are you okay?

30:04.588 --> 30:06.089
What are you doing
out of your room?

30:06.172 --> 30:07.614
-What are you doing
out of your room?

30:07.675 --> 30:11.428
-I don't have a room. Come.
Come. Come on, Mr. Cain. Come.

30:13.013 --> 30:14.556
Let's go to your room.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.241
- No. No. No. No. No. No.
- No, no, what?

30:16.307 --> 30:19.227
-You go. You go.
There's some people.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.187
There's some people
who are very injured

30:21.271 --> 30:22.690
who need your medical attention.

30:22.773 --> 30:25.191
-What? No.
Let's go together.

30:27.653 --> 30:29.446
-Go. Go.

31:09.987 --> 31:10.988
Fuck.

34:48.538 --> 34:49.873
Cain. Cain.

34:49.957 --> 34:53.710
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. It's me. It's me. It's me.

34:53.794 --> 34:55.837
Dr. Garza.

34:55.921 --> 34:59.091
I can explain,
but we need to go.

35:00.383 --> 35:04.554
I found you. In just
a matter of time, they do.

35:04.637 --> 35:07.390
Come on.

35:07.473 --> 35:11.144
They probably
gave you a sedative.

35:12.271 --> 35:13.897
But let me help you.

35:15.065 --> 35:17.818
-Why should I trust you?

35:17.901 --> 35:21.404
How do I know you didn't
try to kill me earlier?

35:21.487 --> 35:26.326
-You don't understand.
They come here all the time.

35:26.409 --> 35:29.913
They use this space
and we always do what they say,

35:29.997 --> 35:34.500
or Eddie threatens our families.
We don't have a choice.

35:37.420 --> 35:41.716
I'm not proud,
the things I sometimes do.

35:45.595 --> 35:49.182
Well, I do what I can
when I can.

35:50.892 --> 35:52.894
-Why am I here?

35:52.978 --> 35:55.063
Why am I in this hospital?

35:55.147 --> 35:57.983
-They want whatever
you have in here.

35:59.276 --> 36:01.611
You stole a case
from General Mondejo.

36:01.694 --> 36:05.365
He's head of the army and
the cartels all report to him.

36:05.448 --> 36:08.952
They tried to test memory drugs

36:09.036 --> 36:11.121
to get you to remember
where you hide case.

36:11.204 --> 36:14.833
But I shot you up with B12
so they got nothing from you.

36:17.169 --> 36:19.670
Let me help you.

36:19.754 --> 36:22.841
-No. No. Are you
fucking kidding me?

36:22.924 --> 36:26.928
-I want you to win.
I hate these fucking people!

36:37.314 --> 36:39.565
-Give me the fucking shot.

36:44.445 --> 36:46.865
You better not be
fucking with me.

36:58.251 --> 36:59.669
Okay.

36:59.752 --> 37:02.798
Let everyone know we kill
the power on everything.

37:06.426 --> 37:08.469
Better lock down all the doors.

38:38.351 --> 38:40.644
Last name.

38:40.728 --> 38:43.106
-Cain.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.815
Standby.

38:46.443 --> 38:47.860
Cain?

38:49.695 --> 38:52.949
- Who is this?
- It's McCoy.

38:54.159 --> 38:57.120
What the hell's going on?
What happened?

38:57.204 --> 38:58.538
-I don't... I don't know.

38:58.621 --> 39:02.375
You've been
out of pocket for days.

39:02.459 --> 39:04.377
-What do you mean,
I've been out of pocket?

39:04.461 --> 39:05.878
Yeah, out of pocket.

39:05.962 --> 39:09.299
Off the map.
Off the fucking grid.

39:09.382 --> 39:11.968
You know where I'm standing right now?

39:12.052 --> 39:13.053
-No.

39:13.094 --> 39:15.388
-In front of your house.

39:17.140 --> 39:20.227
Yeah. There was
a cooked body inside.

39:20.310 --> 39:23.230
We're waiting
on the test results.

39:23.313 --> 39:25.482
We thought you were dead.

39:25.565 --> 39:26.983
-Who's we?

39:27.067 --> 39:30.945
-The DEA. Jesus Christ,
Cain, come on.

39:31.029 --> 39:32.572
What's going on?

39:37.868 --> 39:41.081
-I was in a...
I was in a car accident.

39:43.833 --> 39:46.919
-Yeah?
Well, where were you headed?

39:49.672 --> 39:54.052
-I don't... I don't know.
I can't remember anything.

39:56.429 --> 39:58.681
Hello?

39:58.764 --> 40:00.267
-Oh, shit.

40:00.350 --> 40:02.768
- Hello?
- Connection lost.

40:04.229 --> 40:06.939
- What happened?
- He's on a sat phone.

40:07.023 --> 40:09.109
Sats are rotating,
we'll get him back.

40:09.192 --> 40:11.611
-Why in the hell
is he on a sat phone?

40:11.694 --> 40:14.197
Can you trace it?

40:14.281 --> 40:17.367
-That's the fucking point
of a sat phone.

40:17.450 --> 40:19.160
Oh.

42:09.646 --> 42:11.523
-No, thank you.

42:52.439 --> 42:54.774
Fuck.

43:07.328 --> 43:11.957
I just found a Mexican cocaine
factory inside this hospital.

43:12.041 --> 43:14.210
Start talking.

43:14.294 --> 43:17.004
-Hospitals need to
pay the bills too.

43:18.757 --> 43:20.841
-Tell me everything, now.

43:20.924 --> 43:22.885
-What are you?
Want me to make something up?

43:22.968 --> 43:24.345
-I want you to stop lying.

43:26.389 --> 43:27.890
Tell me. Come on.

43:27.973 --> 43:32.144
-Cain, I don't know
what you did,

43:32.228 --> 43:34.647
but you clearly pissed off
a lot of people

43:34.731 --> 43:37.317
that seem very intent
on killing you today.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.278
-So you and Eddie obviously
knew each other before me.

43:40.361 --> 43:41.780
-Yeah.

43:44.240 --> 43:47.285
-What about you and me? I
mean, if there is a you and me.

43:49.036 --> 43:51.121
-Of course.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.710
I'm not here for Eddie.

43:56.753 --> 43:58.671
I'm here for you.

44:04.927 --> 44:06.846
I love you.

44:12.852 --> 44:14.854
I know that you know that.

44:23.153 --> 44:27.074
-No. I don't know that.

44:31.788 --> 44:33.832
-It's simple, Cain.

44:35.625 --> 44:38.043
Eddie wants what
you took from him.

44:39.128 --> 44:42.214
You and Eddie work
with General Montejo,

44:42.298 --> 44:45.385
and were supposed to
deliver a valuable case.

44:45.468 --> 44:49.722
But you went missing,
and showed up here days later,

44:49.806 --> 44:51.891
no memory of what happened.

44:57.856 --> 44:59.816
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Put it down.

44:59.899 --> 45:02.234
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.

45:55.622 --> 45:57.247
Go! Go!

46:01.084 --> 46:03.086
Holy shit!

46:45.755 --> 46:47.507
-It's empty.

46:53.596 --> 46:55.598
-Oh my god.

46:55.682 --> 46:57.517
-You're hurt bad.

46:58.977 --> 47:00.603
Let me look at it.

47:12.532 --> 47:14.283
I'm gonna find something
to help, okay?

47:14.366 --> 47:15.952
-Okay.

47:19.956 --> 47:22.041
Goddamnit.

47:30.090 --> 47:32.885
Yeah.
- Cain?

47:32.969 --> 47:36.388
-Yeah. Hey, I want you to
write something down for me.

47:38.641 --> 47:42.729
It's Joe's Café.
Tucson, Arizona.

47:42.812 --> 47:47.900
0830062499.

47:49.401 --> 47:51.236
-What is it?

47:51.320 --> 47:52.822
-I don't know.

47:52.905 --> 47:55.908
I'm just hoping that'll give me
some answers. You're DEA.

47:55.992 --> 47:57.744
Maybe you guys
can look into it for me.

47:57.827 --> 48:00.454
-Cain, you are DEA.

48:00.538 --> 48:03.415
Jesus, you're not one of them.

48:03.499 --> 48:07.003
You've been undercover
for the past five years.

48:07.086 --> 48:09.797
You're one of
the best agents we have.

48:09.881 --> 48:12.759
-No. No, that can't be.

48:12.842 --> 48:15.260
-You're fucking
ex-military, Cain.

48:15.344 --> 48:17.597
Not some goddamn drug dealer.

48:17.680 --> 48:21.183
I don't know what they did
to your head, but I promise you

48:21.266 --> 48:23.519
I'll get you
out of there safely.

48:23.603 --> 48:26.480
-Why the fuck am I here?

48:26.564 --> 48:30.192
-I don't know what happened.
You check in every three weeks.

48:30.275 --> 48:31.944
That's your routine.

48:32.028 --> 48:34.864
The last one was
supposed to be two days ago.

48:34.947 --> 48:39.035
Today, you pop up out of
nowhere and now we're here.

48:39.118 --> 48:41.286
-Alright, just get me
the fuck out of here.

48:42.580 --> 48:44.164
-Find him.

48:44.247 --> 48:45.792
-He could be anywhere.

48:45.875 --> 48:52.214
-Use your goddamn head,
Jacobs. How many 6 foot 3 Ken dolls

48:52.297 --> 48:55.300
just show up
with bumps on their heads

48:55.384 --> 48:58.303
within a 100-mile radius
of Tucson,

48:58.387 --> 49:00.640
south or north of the border?

49:00.723 --> 49:03.893
Come on! For Christ's sake,
what do I pay you for?

49:03.976 --> 49:05.268
-I'll figure it out.

49:06.729 --> 49:09.941
- Everything okay?
- Yup. Yup. Yup.

49:12.317 --> 49:15.195
-This should do the trick.

49:15.278 --> 49:16.697
-Thank you.

49:23.746 --> 49:27.290
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

49:27.374 --> 49:30.169
- Here. Hold it.
- I got it.

49:41.848 --> 49:44.307
Aren't you gonna thank me?
- For what?

49:44.391 --> 49:46.476
-For saving your life.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.646
-You gonna thank me?

49:51.816 --> 49:53.860
Let's just get outta here.

49:56.654 --> 49:59.073
-Okay. Alright. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

50:02.869 --> 50:05.121
Hey, Cain!

50:05.204 --> 50:06.789
-Fuck!

50:09.000 --> 50:10.710
Shit.

50:10.793 --> 50:12.377
Cain.

50:17.884 --> 50:18.885
Here, Cain.

50:30.146 --> 50:31.814
-Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

50:41.323 --> 50:43.159
We'll find him,
McCoy. We'll find him.

50:43.242 --> 50:45.368
-Oh, Christ.
He's out there on his own.

50:45.452 --> 50:47.163
He doesn't know what's going on.

50:47.246 --> 50:48.164
We're trying, sir.

50:48.247 --> 50:50.082
-Well, try harder!

50:57.673 --> 50:59.675
Cain.

51:07.975 --> 51:10.352
Hey, Cain!

51:31.707 --> 51:33.709
Did I ask you to do that?

51:33.793 --> 51:35.418
-That's Eddie's voice.

51:37.379 --> 51:39.048
I'm sorry.

51:39.131 --> 51:41.050
Come on, Eddie.

51:43.719 --> 51:45.554
Fuck.

51:56.398 --> 51:57.984
Diego!

51:58.067 --> 51:59.944
- Pendejo.
- It wasn't me.

52:47.992 --> 52:50.870
Let this motherfucker
know we're not playin'.

52:52.288 --> 52:53.956
Then he'll show up.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.875
He couldn't able to go anywhere.

53:10.513 --> 53:12.682
He's in the ceiling.

53:14.476 --> 53:16.228
Cain!

53:17.562 --> 53:19.982
I know you can hear me.

53:21.400 --> 53:23.861
Let's see how many
good guys it takes to kill

53:23.944 --> 53:25.237
before you come down here

53:25.321 --> 53:26.696
and face me like a man!

53:34.663 --> 53:37.749
I know you have
a soft spot for people.

53:41.503 --> 53:42.587
Get him!

53:48.510 --> 53:50.429
No! No!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

53:50.512 --> 53:52.597
Que les pasa!
I want him alive!

53:52.681 --> 53:55.059
I need my fucking case!

54:19.417 --> 54:23.170
Hey! What the
fuck are you doing here?

54:23.254 --> 54:24.546
Get out!

54:45.901 --> 54:47.486
-Get up.

54:48.653 --> 54:50.072
Get up.

54:52.408 --> 54:54.659
-This is not the way

54:54.743 --> 54:56.661
I thought this day would go
when I woke up.

54:56.745 --> 54:58.830
Don't try to charm me.

54:58.914 --> 55:01.666
You're dead, motherfucker.

55:01.750 --> 55:03.043
I know all your tricks.

55:03.127 --> 55:05.379
-Exactly. Yes. You know me.

55:05.463 --> 55:07.672
-Yeah. You bet I know you.

55:07.756 --> 55:09.716
You betrayed us, motherfucker.

55:09.799 --> 55:13.636
-Tell me why
everybody's after me.

55:13.720 --> 55:18.017
-The money was transferred,
but you didn't turn it over.

55:18.100 --> 55:22.771
So you stole the money
and the fucking case.

55:33.407 --> 55:34.533
Account number please.

55:34.616 --> 55:40.247
-0830662499.

55:42.541 --> 55:44.043
Money has been transferred.

55:44.126 --> 55:48.547
Twenty million dollars
deposited as of 3:15 p.m. today.

55:51.300 --> 55:53.843
So they found out
you were gonna skip town.

55:55.054 --> 55:56.972
And the order went out.

55:57.056 --> 55:58.098
-To kill me.

55:59.975 --> 56:00.892
The Sinaloan...

56:00.976 --> 56:02.685
-Fuck Sinaloa, pendejo.

56:02.769 --> 56:06.106
You think we're
here for some small shit?

56:06.190 --> 56:08.484
We're here for the case, cabrón.

56:10.152 --> 56:12.279
-Call Eddie.
I want to talk to him.

56:12.363 --> 56:14.490
-He's well past talking,
asshole.

56:19.411 --> 56:20.412
-Call him.

56:32.841 --> 56:34.717
-Where the fuck are you, Diego?

56:49.441 --> 56:50.442
Diego?

56:51.693 --> 56:53.987
Diego? Diego?

56:54.071 --> 56:55.281
-It's me.

56:57.449 --> 56:59.535
-What do you want?

57:00.536 --> 57:02.621
-I want to talk.

57:02.704 --> 57:05.040
On the roof.
Just you and me.

57:07.959 --> 57:10.379
-I'm going up to the roof.

57:10.462 --> 57:12.464
I'm dealing with
this asshole myself.

57:12.548 --> 57:14.174
-What's the plan?

57:14.258 --> 57:18.387
-Okay, when I go like this,
you kill the motherfucker.

57:18.470 --> 57:23.058
-Okay. I will put a bunch
of snipers on the rooftop.

57:23.142 --> 57:25.060
Don't worry, Eddie.

57:26.478 --> 57:27.563
-Yeah.

57:31.650 --> 57:32.651
I'm going in

57:32.734 --> 57:35.404
and pulling Cain out
of that hospital.

57:35.487 --> 57:40.117
He's in too deep.
And the cartels are onto him.

57:40.200 --> 57:43.454
Cain is three hours
from the border

57:43.537 --> 57:47.416
in a small cartel-run hospital.

57:47.499 --> 57:51.044
So I'm going to need
a security clearance.

57:51.128 --> 57:52.588
-We can't authorize that.

57:52.671 --> 57:54.839
Cain is too far undercover.

57:54.923 --> 57:56.258
We need to burn him.

57:56.342 --> 57:57.593
Cain's a fucking war hero.

57:57.676 --> 57:58.677
-Settle down.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.347
-I'm going down there and

58:01.430 --> 58:04.266
pullin' his ass
out of that hospital.

58:04.350 --> 58:06.726
-I'll consider it,
but I want wires in that car,

58:07.727 --> 58:10.772
cameras across the way
so nothing goes wrong.

58:10.855 --> 58:13.858
-No. No wires. No cameras.

58:13.942 --> 58:16.612
We're on a foreign soil here
and we're trying...

58:16.695 --> 58:18.947
-It's not going to happen,
McCoy.

58:19.030 --> 58:20.031
If something goes wrong

58:20.115 --> 58:22.159
everybody in this room
gets the blame.

58:22.242 --> 58:24.411
-We're talking about Cain here.

58:26.538 --> 58:27.956
-You've been trying
to protect Cain

58:28.039 --> 58:30.292
since you first
brought him here.

58:30.376 --> 58:33.337
So I'm recommending that
we dump fire on that place

58:33.420 --> 58:35.547
and be done with it.

58:35.631 --> 58:38.175
-You got six hours.

58:38.258 --> 58:39.635
And then with or without you,

58:39.718 --> 58:41.553
we're gonna burn
the fucking place.

58:42.804 --> 58:46.600
-Let me tell you
how this is gonna go.

58:46.684 --> 58:49.060
If you burn him,

58:49.144 --> 58:52.731
if you burn Cain, you burn me.

59:11.833 --> 59:13.419
-Alright

59:13.502 --> 59:15.920
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

59:16.004 --> 59:18.173
-Tequila. Wait.

59:41.613 --> 59:43.699
You remember anything yet?

59:45.242 --> 59:46.326
-Yeah.

59:47.369 --> 59:49.621
Apparently I'm DEA.

59:55.627 --> 59:57.796
-No shit.

59:58.921 --> 1:00:00.923
I know that.

1:00:03.719 --> 1:00:05.928
You double-cross motherfuckers.

1:00:08.097 --> 1:00:10.809
Actually we did it together.

1:00:10.892 --> 1:00:12.227
-Bullshit.

1:00:13.645 --> 1:00:17.065
Bullshit. You're lying.
I can tell when you're lying.

1:00:17.148 --> 1:00:19.401
-Oh, now you're
remembering shit?

1:00:20.527 --> 1:00:22.821
-Yeah, you could

1:00:22.904 --> 1:00:24.740
you could tell me
anything you want right now.

1:00:24.823 --> 1:00:26.949
You could tell me
fucking Santa Claus was real

1:00:27.033 --> 1:00:29.286
and I'd probably believe you.

1:00:30.579 --> 1:00:32.097
-You can think
whatever the fuck you want

1:00:32.121 --> 1:00:33.665
about Santa, but

1:00:34.708 --> 1:00:38.378
everything I just told you
is the truth.

1:00:40.422 --> 1:00:43.966
We were playing all
these motherfuckers together.

1:00:44.050 --> 1:00:46.678
But you went off book,

1:00:46.762 --> 1:00:49.431
and you stole
something without me.

1:00:49.515 --> 1:00:53.519
The General's fucking case.
We have to return it.

1:00:54.686 --> 1:00:57.689
You see, when you
go outside of this,

1:00:57.773 --> 1:00:59.190
that's when the problems come.

1:01:02.110 --> 1:01:04.404
You fucked over
the only two organizations

1:01:04.488 --> 1:01:06.239
that can save you.

1:01:06.323 --> 1:01:09.451
DEA and the cartel.

1:01:11.411 --> 1:01:13.413
-What's in that case?

1:01:15.415 --> 1:01:17.334
-The best thing ever.

1:01:17.417 --> 1:01:19.711
- The best thing ever?
- Our golden ticket.

1:01:20.712 --> 1:01:25.592
DEA, cartels, fuck them.

1:01:25.676 --> 1:01:29.680
Fuck them all.
We'll beat all of them.

1:01:31.348 --> 1:01:33.057
-Come on. Come on.

1:01:33.141 --> 1:01:34.810
The best thing ever?
The golden ticket.

1:01:34.893 --> 1:01:36.562
Above the cartel...
I mean, come on.

1:01:36.645 --> 1:01:38.522
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

1:01:40.691 --> 1:01:44.235
Huh? Why am I here?
Who the fuck am I?

1:01:45.236 --> 1:01:47.238
Am I a good guy
or am I a bad guy?

1:01:47.322 --> 1:01:50.325
Because I'm starting to feel
like I'm not such a good guy.

1:01:50.409 --> 1:01:52.285
I just stole this gun
from some dude

1:01:52.369 --> 1:01:54.580
and I kicked his ass
out the window.

1:01:55.581 --> 1:01:57.123
That's not good!

1:01:59.167 --> 1:02:00.919
-You killed Diego?

1:02:05.173 --> 1:02:06.341
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

1:02:06.425 --> 1:02:07.593
-Yeah, Diego's probably...

1:02:07.676 --> 1:02:09.928
He's probably
not going to make it.

1:02:10.011 --> 1:02:11.805
Sorry.

1:02:17.519 --> 1:02:18.604
-Okay.

1:02:19.605 --> 1:02:21.607
You really wanna know?

1:02:24.984 --> 1:02:27.195
You're a good man, Cain.

1:02:28.196 --> 1:02:29.364
But it doesn't matter.

1:02:30.866 --> 1:02:34.703
The only thing that matters
in this country is power.

1:02:35.746 --> 1:02:37.873
Power.

1:02:37.956 --> 1:02:40.751
And you can pick
a side after we get it.

1:02:40.834 --> 1:02:43.420
If you wanna go and
save the rainforest, go ahead.

1:02:43.503 --> 1:02:44.963
I mean

1:02:45.046 --> 1:02:46.465
if it makes you happy

1:02:48.717 --> 1:02:52.512
But now I need you to tell me.

1:02:53.805 --> 1:02:55.056
Where is it?

1:02:55.139 --> 1:02:58.017
You gotta remember something.

1:03:05.525 --> 1:03:08.152
- I remember something.
- You do?

1:03:15.869 --> 1:03:17.579
-A tunnel.

1:03:17.663 --> 1:03:21.249
-Okay. What else did you see?

1:03:27.296 --> 1:03:28.423
You carrying something?

1:03:29.925 --> 1:03:33.261
-A steel case.
I'm guessing it was the case.

1:03:33.344 --> 1:03:35.722
-Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1:03:37.933 --> 1:03:40.268
The case.
Where did you leave it, man?

1:03:40.351 --> 1:03:42.980
I need more information.
Give me more. Give...

1:03:55.283 --> 1:03:56.827
-You dick!

1:03:58.036 --> 1:03:59.412
Okay, stop it!

1:04:04.292 --> 1:04:06.670
If you had any clue
what I've done for you, man.

1:04:14.469 --> 1:04:17.305
-We must kill Cain.

1:04:24.855 --> 1:04:26.732
-And you're all agreed on this?

1:04:28.483 --> 1:04:31.862
I mean, what's
the profit and loss here?

1:04:32.904 --> 1:04:34.573
Really?

1:04:34.656 --> 1:04:37.868
-He stole from us, Eduardo.

1:04:37.951 --> 1:04:38.994
-And how many of you

1:04:39.077 --> 1:04:41.788
have stolen from each other
over the years?

1:04:41.872 --> 1:04:44.666
-But we are La Raza.

1:04:44.750 --> 1:04:47.044
Cain's a fucking gringo.

1:04:48.252 --> 1:04:50.797
-It's been decided, Eduardo.

1:04:50.881 --> 1:04:53.257
End of conversation, okay?

1:04:54.342 --> 1:04:56.011
-Okay.

1:04:57.054 --> 1:04:59.347
If you do this,

1:05:01.265 --> 1:05:03.935
you better pray
to God you don't miss.

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:07.522
'Cause if you do,

1:05:09.608 --> 1:05:11.777
I'm surrounded by dead men.

1:05:16.073 --> 1:05:18.282
- Salud.
- Salud.

1:05:19.450 --> 1:05:21.202
-Oh, what have you done for me?

1:05:24.039 --> 1:05:24.956
I'm outta here.

1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:26.541
-Where do you think
you're going?

1:05:26.625 --> 1:05:27.542
-I gotta get the fuck
outta here.

1:05:27.626 --> 1:05:28.794
-Cain. Cain.

1:05:28.877 --> 1:05:32.047
Hasta la vista, you dick.

1:05:32.130 --> 1:05:33.924
Cain! Cain!

1:05:43.683 --> 1:05:45.685
Fuck.

1:05:55.403 --> 1:05:57.321
Fuck.

1:05:58.740 --> 1:05:59.741
Yeah?

1:05:59.825 --> 1:06:02.284
-We found the tunnel, Cain.

1:06:03.327 --> 1:06:05.831
The number you gave came back

1:06:05.914 --> 1:06:07.916
traced to an off-shore account.

1:06:08.917 --> 1:06:12.336
Last transaction, two days ago.

1:06:13.337 --> 1:06:15.214
How's the memory?

1:06:19.136 --> 1:06:20.344
-I did some bad shit.

1:06:21.429 --> 1:06:23.598
I'm pretty sure of it.

1:06:23.682 --> 1:06:26.225
We've been
friends for a long time.

1:06:30.271 --> 1:06:31.606
How's your pop?

1:06:32.858 --> 1:06:35.193
- Traveling. Always traveling.
- Yeah?

1:06:35.276 --> 1:06:36.987
-Anything he can do to avoid me.

1:06:37.070 --> 1:06:38.071
-Well

1:06:39.156 --> 1:06:43.409
No, your dad and I lost
a lot of brothers in the war.

1:06:43.492 --> 1:06:46.370
When you went down
and signed up,

1:06:46.454 --> 1:06:50.041
it flipped a switch in his head.

1:06:50.125 --> 1:06:55.046
When your best buddy
is bleeding out in your arms,

1:06:55.130 --> 1:06:57.674
it's hard to imagine

1:06:57.757 --> 1:07:02.511
that your own child's gonna go
through that experience.

1:07:05.140 --> 1:07:07.433
You know, sometimes it's better

1:07:08.476 --> 1:07:12.772
not to feel love, you know?

1:07:14.482 --> 1:07:16.234
Not to hurt.

1:07:17.359 --> 1:07:20.279
So, I'll ask again.

1:07:20.362 --> 1:07:22.949
How's the memory?

1:07:24.075 --> 1:07:26.036
-Look, I'm sorry
for whatever I did.

1:07:26.119 --> 1:07:28.412
I'll turn myself in
and I'll cooperate.

1:07:30.123 --> 1:07:32.751
The most important thing
is you have to come find me.

1:07:32.834 --> 1:07:35.003
We have a serious
hostage situation here.

1:07:35.086 --> 1:07:38.256
Multiple cartel members
have swarmed this place.

1:07:38.339 --> 1:07:40.317
And they're about to start
dropping innocents like flies.

1:07:40.341 --> 1:07:43.678
Hostages? This
is a federal issue now.

1:07:43.762 --> 1:07:47.348
I'm ordering 18 eggs,
extra jalapeños.

1:07:47.431 --> 1:07:51.269
I'll bring the spice,
you stay put. Capiche?

1:07:51.352 --> 1:07:53.104
-I'm assuming you found me.

1:07:53.188 --> 1:07:55.648
You're in a Mexican hospital.

1:07:55.732 --> 1:07:56.649
We'll be there soon,

1:07:56.733 --> 1:07:58.609
so stay alive till then.

1:07:58.693 --> 1:08:02.446
Just get to the back end
of the hospital at sunrise.

1:08:02.530 --> 1:08:06.450
I'll make sure you
get treated respectfully.

1:08:08.619 --> 1:08:11.622
I'm not sure what
to say right now, Cain.

1:08:11.706 --> 1:08:15.376
I guess I put
too much faith in you.

1:08:16.544 --> 1:08:18.964
This one hurts.
I'm not gonna lie.

1:08:23.969 --> 1:08:25.971
We're ready to move out.
Let's go!

1:08:33.895 --> 1:08:35.814
We'll pull Cain out at the back

1:08:35.897 --> 1:08:38.149
before this shit goes down.

1:08:38.233 --> 1:08:40.693
I don't want any mistakes!

1:08:57.418 --> 1:08:59.420
You always understood me
better than he did anyway.

1:09:00.629 --> 1:09:02.132
-There's nobody
that understands you

1:09:02.215 --> 1:09:04.425
any better than your pop.

1:09:04.508 --> 1:09:07.971
You know, I'm the asshole

1:09:08.054 --> 1:09:10.098
that took you out
there by the shed

1:09:10.181 --> 1:09:11.702
and taught you
how to smoke cigarettes.

1:09:12.892 --> 1:09:15.186
-And you turned green,
and threw up.

1:09:15.270 --> 1:09:16.938
- I remember that.
- Yeah?

1:09:17.022 --> 1:09:18.791
-Yeah, there was a few
nudie magazines back there.

1:09:18.815 --> 1:09:20.167
I never said you were
a good influence.

1:09:20.191 --> 1:09:21.109
-No.

1:09:21.192 --> 1:09:23.111
-I said
you understood me better.

1:09:32.037 --> 1:09:33.038
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:09:52.723 --> 1:09:54.725
What do you want?

1:10:00.899 --> 1:10:03.151
-I'm done playing around.

1:10:03.234 --> 1:10:05.362
- What? No.
- No problem.

1:10:05.444 --> 1:10:07.364
-No! No! No!

1:10:13.953 --> 1:10:15.704
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

1:10:17.248 --> 1:10:19.417
Get on the fucking floor!

1:10:25.506 --> 1:10:26.507
Cain?

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.608
Hey, Cain!

1:10:51.241 --> 1:10:53.159
Shit.

1:10:54.911 --> 1:10:57.205
Oh, come on.

1:11:11.719 --> 1:11:13.762
-Cain.

1:11:15.140 --> 1:11:16.474
Cain!

1:11:17.976 --> 1:11:21.396
I have hostages in the lobby.

1:11:22.730 --> 1:11:26.317
And I'm gonna start
killing people in 15 minutes.

1:11:31.072 --> 1:11:33.032
Cain.

1:11:34.033 --> 1:11:36.869
You could end
it right away, Cain.

1:11:37.912 --> 1:11:40.831
They're all gonna
die because of you.

1:11:43.251 --> 1:11:44.252
Cain.

1:11:44.294 --> 1:11:46.254
Your memory?

1:11:49.966 --> 1:11:52.969
-It's fuzzy,
but it's getting there.

1:11:54.012 --> 1:11:55.096
-That's convenient.

1:11:56.181 --> 1:12:00.101
Not having a memory
and 20 million dollars,

1:12:01.352 --> 1:12:02.979
and a grab bag of information

1:12:03.062 --> 1:12:06.024
that can actually
destroy the government.

1:12:06.107 --> 1:12:07.400
Cain.

1:12:07.484 --> 1:12:09.402
-Who are you really with?

1:12:10.445 --> 1:12:12.071
Juarez?

1:12:13.281 --> 1:12:15.866
Zetas? MS-13?

1:12:15.950 --> 1:12:16.951
-How funny.

1:12:17.952 --> 1:12:22.040
The only three you name
are the exact reason we're here.

1:12:25.210 --> 1:12:27.628
You know who I work for.

1:12:28.796 --> 1:12:30.839
It's you I'm beginning
to worry about.

1:12:34.135 --> 1:12:36.554
Just finish
the fucking job, Cain.

1:12:40.016 --> 1:12:42.726
-Come on, Jacobs. Let's go.
We're going too slow.

1:13:02.372 --> 1:13:04.582
-Please no! Please no!
Please no! Please no!

1:13:04.665 --> 1:13:06.834
No! Please! No.

1:13:13.550 --> 1:13:15.260
-CIA?

1:13:15.343 --> 1:13:16.694
-If this is a game
you're playing...

1:13:16.718 --> 1:13:17.970
-Answer the fucking question.

1:13:18.054 --> 1:13:20.515
-I'm CIA. You know I'm CIA.

1:13:21.682 --> 1:13:25.436
I work with people
you thought were rumors.

1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:27.188
-Who?

1:13:28.314 --> 1:13:32.443
-Like deep state?
Illuminati?

1:13:33.444 --> 1:13:36.197
-It's a 3-D chess game, John.

1:13:36.281 --> 1:13:39.492
The DEA, they play checkers.

1:13:41.785 --> 1:13:43.704
But you know all this.

1:13:44.872 --> 1:13:47.125
This is why you agreed
to get the case for me

1:13:47.208 --> 1:13:48.376
in the first place.

1:13:51.795 --> 1:13:53.797
-You recruited me.

1:13:55.716 --> 1:13:58.677
You knew that I was
an agent for the DEA.

1:14:00.721 --> 1:14:03.141
-"You can't stop people
from snorting and shooting.

1:14:03.224 --> 1:14:05.809
They've been doing
it since Adam and Eve."

1:14:05.893 --> 1:14:07.437
That's a quote from you.

1:14:10.772 --> 1:14:12.233
Give me the case.

1:14:13.318 --> 1:14:14.611
You can keep the money
you stole.

1:14:14.693 --> 1:14:16.695
It's dirty anyhow.

1:14:18.114 --> 1:14:21.909
It's not about this deal.
It's not about the next deal.

1:14:22.910 --> 1:14:24.329
It's about order.

1:14:26.331 --> 1:14:28.999
When you went off the grid,
you fucked up that order.

1:14:29.083 --> 1:14:31.377
And now I gotta fix it.

1:14:57.945 --> 1:14:59.697
-You can't stop the crime.

1:14:59.780 --> 1:15:02.158
-But you can
control the criminal.

1:15:09.957 --> 1:15:10.999
John.

1:15:13.001 --> 1:15:14.629
I need you.

1:15:18.799 --> 1:15:20.343
You can trust me.

1:15:33.231 --> 1:15:34.815
-Give me the fucking shells.

1:15:40.904 --> 1:15:42.281
-I have a walkie.

1:15:51.832 --> 1:15:53.167
Be careful.

1:15:53.251 --> 1:15:57.255
-You want me to trust you?
You stay right the fuck there.

1:15:58.631 --> 1:16:00.633
You don't move.

1:16:34.041 --> 1:16:35.125
Eddie.

1:16:36.461 --> 1:16:37.961
Eddie.

1:16:38.045 --> 1:16:39.505
Eddie.

1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:42.966
-Cain.

1:16:45.052 --> 1:16:46.070
Meet me on the fifth floor.

1:16:46.094 --> 1:16:47.722
Let's get this over with.

1:16:50.974 --> 1:16:54.520
-If I'm not come back in ten,
start the slaughter.

1:16:59.107 --> 1:17:01.819
Oh my god, this is different,
huh?

1:17:01.902 --> 1:17:04.447
This is so funny.
We used to be friends.

1:17:05.906 --> 1:17:09.744
-Cheers. Dear friend,
for your life, old friend.

1:17:09.827 --> 1:17:11.245
-My friend.

1:17:11.329 --> 1:17:12.913
You know
you can trust me, right?

1:17:12.996 --> 1:17:14.039
-I know.

1:17:15.082 --> 1:17:19.796
It's been a privilege
to have a friend like you.

1:17:27.261 --> 1:17:28.387
-We're gonna make a deal.

1:17:29.472 --> 1:17:30.598
-You making deals

1:17:30.681 --> 1:17:33.309
is the whole reason
we're standing right here.

1:17:34.310 --> 1:17:35.520
-Make a deal.

1:17:36.687 --> 1:17:38.289
Or I put a bullet
right between his eyes.

1:17:42.693 --> 1:17:43.694
-There.

1:17:44.862 --> 1:17:48.282
Out of your conscience.
Now, let me tell you...

1:17:57.583 --> 1:18:00.670
-Just tell me.
Did you bury it?

1:18:01.796 --> 1:18:03.255
Did you mail it to your mom?

1:18:11.430 --> 1:18:12.348
-Come on, man.

1:18:12.431 --> 1:18:14.393
Just put him out of his
fucking misery, would you?

1:18:28.573 --> 1:18:31.742
Cain!
We made such a great team.

1:18:32.743 --> 1:18:34.620
It's so sad that
it's gonna end like this.

1:18:46.632 --> 1:18:47.633
Cain!

1:18:55.933 --> 1:18:58.018
-You are so pretty.

1:19:36.306 --> 1:19:37.642
-Time's up.

1:19:46.442 --> 1:19:47.985
-Motherfucker!

1:19:48.986 --> 1:19:50.905
Chinga tu madre!

1:20:44.041 --> 1:20:46.043
-It's so sad it's
gonna end like this.

1:20:46.126 --> 1:20:47.920
It's so sad, Cain.

1:20:49.005 --> 1:20:52.132
'Cause I really love you.

1:20:53.174 --> 1:20:54.175
Uh?

1:21:33.549 --> 1:21:35.342
It's you.

1:21:47.772 --> 1:21:49.774
It's you.

1:21:51.525 --> 1:21:54.111
It's been you the whole time.

1:21:56.404 --> 1:21:57.948
You changed your hair.

1:21:59.491 --> 1:22:01.451
-That's what we do.

1:22:05.122 --> 1:22:06.414
I love you.

1:22:09.001 --> 1:22:10.418
-I love you.

1:22:11.461 --> 1:22:13.463
I love you too.

1:22:16.967 --> 1:22:19.720
You found the case.

1:22:19.804 --> 1:22:21.346
Yeah.

1:22:21.429 --> 1:22:24.058
I found it in
Dr. Garza's office.

1:22:24.141 --> 1:22:26.476
He must have taken it
when they brought you in.

1:22:27.477 --> 1:22:30.147
Garza always hated Eddie.

1:22:31.148 --> 1:22:32.650
I think he was
planning on selling it,

1:22:32.733 --> 1:22:34.484
getting out of Dodge.

1:22:40.407 --> 1:22:42.701
-Let's get out of here.

1:23:49.852 --> 1:23:53.521
-I don't know whether to
hug you, Cain, or shoot you.

1:23:53.605 --> 1:23:55.315
-Yeah, it's good
to see you, too, McCoy.

1:23:55.398 --> 1:23:59.653
-I can only imagine the
shit storm you just ran through.

1:23:59.737 --> 1:24:02.948
I feel young just
sitting in the car next to you.

1:24:03.032 --> 1:24:05.743
-I know what needs to happen.

1:24:05.826 --> 1:24:07.745
So if I can just get a shower,

1:24:07.828 --> 1:24:09.246
maybe a cheeseburger and a beer,

1:24:09.329 --> 1:24:10.664
I'm happy to turn myself in.

1:24:10.748 --> 1:24:13.834
-You bet. I'll get
you over to the embassy

1:24:13.918 --> 1:24:18.338
and we can raid their fridge.
You know?

1:24:20.590 --> 1:24:22.134
Is that it?

1:24:22.218 --> 1:24:23.593
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:24:26.638 --> 1:24:27.765
-What the fuck!

1:24:28.766 --> 1:24:31.101
- Whoa, whoa, Cain.
- What the fuck was that?

1:24:32.102 --> 1:24:34.521
- Cain. Cain.
- What's going on?

1:24:34.604 --> 1:24:38.150
-You just assaulted
a federal agent.

1:24:39.151 --> 1:24:42.696
Whoa. Take it easy. Cain. Cain.

1:24:43.697 --> 1:24:45.365
Cain.

1:24:46.533 --> 1:24:51.080
You know, that
case in your lap there

1:24:51.163 --> 1:24:55.960
it's never gonna see the
light of day. Forget about it.

1:24:56.043 --> 1:24:57.627
-You fucking rat.

1:24:57.711 --> 1:24:59.964
-Squeak, squeak. You got me.

1:25:04.927 --> 1:25:07.512
-You're supposed to
be one of the good guys.

1:25:07.595 --> 1:25:09.639
What the fuck is going on?

1:25:09.723 --> 1:25:13.434
-You really hit that head
of yours hard, didn't you?

1:25:14.937 --> 1:25:17.647
-What's in this case that's
got everybody so excited?

1:25:18.648 --> 1:25:21.068
-What's in the case?

1:25:21.151 --> 1:25:24.321
The whos, the whats,
and the wheres.

1:25:24.404 --> 1:25:27.157
The puppeteers and the puppets.

1:25:27.241 --> 1:25:29.701
The leaders and the members.

1:25:29.785 --> 1:25:31.954
The avatars and the aviators.

1:25:32.037 --> 1:25:33.831
-What the fuck
is he talking about?

1:25:33.914 --> 1:25:38.002
-Presidents,
dictators, elections.

1:25:38.085 --> 1:25:40.337
Broadway theater.

1:25:40.420 --> 1:25:43.423
It's all fucking rigged.
It's all placed.

1:25:43.506 --> 1:25:45.633
-So let me get this straight.

1:25:45.717 --> 1:25:49.013
You're telling me that the names
and addresses of the Illuminati

1:25:49.096 --> 1:25:53.433
and Moses' tablets
are in this case?

1:25:53.516 --> 1:25:55.518
Are you fucking serious?

1:25:55.602 --> 1:25:59.480
-Well, I don't know
about the tablets.

1:25:59.564 --> 1:26:02.943
But from where I'm sitting, son,

1:26:03.027 --> 1:26:05.946
you are a true hero

1:26:06.030 --> 1:26:09.616
that deserves
an honorable death.

1:26:10.742 --> 1:26:14.330
Perception.
That's what we manage.

1:26:14.412 --> 1:26:18.416
Ask Anna here.
She knows all this.

1:26:22.171 --> 1:26:24.965
-Oh, so you guys
are on a first name basis.

1:26:25.049 --> 1:26:28.302
So you obviously
know each other.

1:26:28.385 --> 1:26:31.263
-I really wish
you had your memory.

1:26:31.347 --> 1:26:33.349
It's getting kind of annoying.

1:26:34.975 --> 1:26:37.394
-You told me that
I could trust you.

1:26:37.477 --> 1:26:38.896
-Love hurts.

1:27:01.668 --> 1:27:04.922
You know, I have
this recurring dream

1:27:05.005 --> 1:27:08.675
that I die at the beach
with a drink in my hand.

1:27:08.758 --> 1:27:11.594
I guess it's not
gonna be that way.

1:27:11.678 --> 1:27:14.681
So, just get it over with,
will ya?

1:27:14.764 --> 1:27:17.434
-I think I'll let God decide
how you go, McCoy.

1:27:17.517 --> 1:27:20.520
Yeah, I remember enough
to know that I used to like you.

1:27:22.106 --> 1:27:23.815
Adios, amigo.

1:27:23.899 --> 1:27:25.359
-Attaboy.

1:27:28.778 --> 1:27:33.033
Goddamn!
Son of a bitch, you shot me!

1:27:33.117 --> 1:27:34.826
-You're goddamn right I did.

1:27:34.910 --> 1:27:36.036
I just did you a favor.

1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:38.288
If I didn't shoot you,
you'd sure enough be dead.

1:27:38.372 --> 1:27:39.373
Think about that.
