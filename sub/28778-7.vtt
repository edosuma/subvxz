WEBVTT

00:00.998 --> 00:02.629
My name is Danny McNamara.

00:02.635 --> 00:04.700
When I left the FBI,
I thought my crime-fighting

00:04.705 --> 00:06.346
days were over, but then I learned

00:06.352 --> 00:08.958
that terrorist Karim Farouk
was on the hunt for Cleopatra,

00:08.964 --> 00:11.065
one of the world's most
valuable treasures,

00:11.071 --> 00:12.644
lost for over 2,000 years,

00:12.650 --> 00:14.851
to use her as part of a
massive terror attack.

00:14.868 --> 00:16.592
To find him, I needed some help,

00:16.598 --> 00:19.133
so I went to Lexi Vaziri, a thief.

00:19.139 --> 00:21.670
Excuse me, a master thief.

00:21.709 --> 00:23.777
And my father was killed by Farouk.

00:23.845 --> 00:26.413
Lexi and I have a complicated past.

00:26.419 --> 00:30.075
He wants to bring Farouk
to justice, I want revenge.

00:30.081 --> 00:31.980
Also, there's a mysterious group

00:31.986 --> 00:33.620
who want Cleopatra as much as we do.

00:33.688 --> 00:35.901
We're not sure whether
they're good or bad,

00:35.907 --> 00:37.744
but the one thing we all agree on...

00:37.750 --> 00:39.849
Is that we need to find Cleopatra...

00:41.295 --> 00:43.363
Before Farouk does.

00:44.532 --> 00:46.333
Previously on Blood & Treasure...

00:46.400 --> 00:49.438
Fabi. You're in the
Brotherhood of Serapis.

00:49.587 --> 00:51.870
And you, Lexi, can be a part of it.

00:51.876 --> 00:53.658
I can't do this without Danny.

00:53.664 --> 00:56.232
And if you tell him,
you will both be dead.

00:56.439 --> 00:57.839
The only way you survive

00:57.845 --> 00:59.146
is working with us.

00:59.603 --> 01:01.737
- Where's Shaw?
- In there.

01:02.544 --> 01:04.446
Shaw's escaped again.

01:04.452 --> 01:07.020
Crate's here, but no Cleopatra.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.350
It's a Casablanca regiment.

01:08.356 --> 01:10.023
So they went to Casablanca.

01:10.091 --> 01:12.183
You two destroyed my bazaar.

01:12.189 --> 01:13.441
I lost millions.

01:13.447 --> 01:15.056
You know, I've been very much

01:15.062 --> 01:16.858
looking forward to killing you.

01:17.855 --> 01:19.920
No! Luca...

01:19.926 --> 01:22.002
Interpol is all over
what happened there.

01:22.069 --> 01:23.549
Agent Karlsson suspects your

01:23.555 --> 01:25.510
involvement and she is not pleased.

01:25.516 --> 01:26.902
You should get out of here now,

01:26.908 --> 01:28.241
because she's coming for you.

01:28.247 --> 01:30.078
Came across an old list of names.

01:30.084 --> 01:31.973
Former members at some time or other.

01:31.979 --> 01:34.214
One of the names kind of stuck out.

01:34.282 --> 01:35.482
Vaziri?

01:35.488 --> 01:37.794
I'd say your father was in
the Brotherhood of Serapis.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.219
What?

01:48.433 --> 01:51.981
_

02:04.412 --> 02:07.039
- Lieutenant Heinz.
- What took so long?

02:07.045 --> 02:09.014
There's a bounty on us.

02:11.876 --> 02:14.337
_

02:16.324 --> 02:18.725
The boat leaves with or without us.

02:18.731 --> 02:21.989
We have less than one hour
to catch it. Get to work.

02:21.995 --> 02:23.716
Salaam alaikum.

03:10.935 --> 03:13.041
_

03:13.047 --> 03:15.673
I'm pretty sure I already
know the answer to this,

03:15.679 --> 03:18.160
but have you seen
Casablanca... the movie?

03:18.166 --> 03:19.934
Yeah, of course I have.

03:20.087 --> 03:22.288
Name one character.

03:22.356 --> 03:24.457
- Joe.
- Nice try.

03:24.525 --> 03:27.949
Oh, come on. It's an old movie,
there's not one Joe?

03:27.955 --> 03:29.496
You know, you'd like it.

03:29.563 --> 03:32.465
It's got it all. Love,
danger, rebellion.

03:32.471 --> 03:35.139
When this whole thing's over,
we're doing a movie night.

03:35.145 --> 03:37.937
So after we catch Farouk, you're
not going back to America?

03:38.740 --> 03:41.099
I haven't really thought that far ahead.

03:41.105 --> 03:43.810
Well, feel free to think it over
when you check us in.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.264
Are you in Casablanca?

03:54.270 --> 03:56.105
Yes. We're very close
to finding Cleopatra,

03:56.111 --> 03:58.054
but I have a question for you.

03:58.060 --> 03:59.436
Were you ever gonna tell me my

03:59.442 --> 04:00.904
father was in the Brotherhood?

04:00.910 --> 04:02.524
Where did you hear that?

04:02.530 --> 04:04.267
I'm asking the questions now.

04:04.273 --> 04:06.375
If you don't want me to
keep secrets from you,

04:06.381 --> 04:07.815
don't keep any from me.

04:09.318 --> 04:10.885
Simon Hardwick.

04:12.030 --> 04:13.397
You need a better source.

04:13.403 --> 04:14.837
So it's not true?

04:14.843 --> 04:17.612
No. Now please focus.

04:17.723 --> 04:20.423
We lost track of Farouk's men
when they fled Spain.

04:20.430 --> 04:21.701
They could be on your tail.

04:21.707 --> 04:23.074
I highly doubt it.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.400
They missed the trail that
the Nazis took Cleopatra here.

04:25.406 --> 04:27.462
We're completely off their radar

04:27.468 --> 04:29.290
and ahead of Farouk for once.

04:29.296 --> 04:31.701
Well, you have a way of
putting yourself on the radar.

04:31.707 --> 04:33.274
I take that as a compliment.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.181
You shouldn't.

04:40.716 --> 04:43.284
- What's up?
- The card was declined.

04:43.290 --> 04:46.428
It's Reece's. There's, like,
a bajillion-dollar limit on it.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.110
I think we've been Red
Noticed by Interpol

04:48.116 --> 04:49.762
for the shoot-out in Spain.

04:49.768 --> 04:51.256
Our assets are frozen.

04:51.502 --> 04:54.304
There's some money on the
plane, in Reece's safe.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.162
He has a safe?

04:57.229 --> 04:59.364
Under the first chair on the left.

04:59.432 --> 05:01.700
Have you been... Never mind.

05:01.767 --> 05:04.245
They've probably impounded
Reece's jet, and our passports

05:04.251 --> 05:06.571
will be revoked if they
haven't already been.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.573
If they find us they're gonna arrest us.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.640
Your pal Gwen couldn't
have given you a heads-up?

05:10.646 --> 05:12.300
Pretty sure she's the one who filed it.

05:12.306 --> 05:14.941
Gwen, as per usual, can suck it.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.379
I'm not leaving until we find Cleopatra.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.851
Agreed. We should go
to the port authority,

05:19.857 --> 05:21.910
see if they have any records
of the Nazis coming in.

05:21.916 --> 05:23.503
We just need to get off the grid.

05:23.509 --> 05:25.990
It's too late. Moroccan police.

05:26.058 --> 05:28.359
Follow me.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.561
I told you I'd catch up with you.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.438
Danny?

06:03.866 --> 06:06.000
I knew you'd come out this way.

06:07.555 --> 06:10.224
You were told not to leave
the EU without permission.

06:10.515 --> 06:13.083
And you did, leaving a
pile of bodies in Spain.

06:13.089 --> 06:14.267
Gwen,

06:14.273 --> 06:18.176
we are so close to finding Cleopatra.

06:18.182 --> 06:20.234
We're actually ahead of Farouk.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.674
I don't care.

06:23.893 --> 06:26.985
You are going to pay for
the murder of my son Luca.

07:16.802 --> 07:18.102
You asked for this.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.370
Aah!

07:23.904 --> 07:25.104
Danny.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.113
Carlo's here.

07:34.213 --> 07:36.347
Where are we gonna go?

07:36.415 --> 07:38.183
We hardly have any cash on us.

07:38.189 --> 07:39.855
- Can't you just call Reece?
- No,

07:39.861 --> 07:41.815
I already pulled the SIM
card out of my phone.

07:41.821 --> 07:43.988
That's probably how Gwen found us.

07:44.056 --> 07:46.191
Walk this way. Come on.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.334
Oh, that doesn't look too good.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.474
Oh, I've had worse.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.715
Right now, we have to
get off the streets,

08:00.721 --> 08:03.590
before our faces are
plastered all over town.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.687
Do you smell lamb?

08:17.353 --> 08:18.518
What?

08:18.524 --> 08:20.458
Someone's cooking lamb.

08:25.764 --> 08:27.132
Perfect.

08:27.199 --> 08:29.234
No one's gonna look for us here.

08:40.054 --> 08:43.655
_

08:48.420 --> 08:50.054
You look lost.

08:51.390 --> 08:52.991
U-Um, no.

08:52.997 --> 08:55.209
No, sorry. We were just...

08:56.005 --> 08:59.407
Whatever is outside that
wall is not my business.

08:59.765 --> 09:01.566
You are welcome to stay here.

09:01.572 --> 09:02.949
This is a refugee camp.

09:02.955 --> 09:04.365
It's a sanctuary for people

09:04.371 --> 09:05.932
who have nowhere else to go.

09:05.938 --> 09:07.038
Follow me, please.

09:14.457 --> 09:17.192
_

09:50.382 --> 09:53.051
We do what we can to
give them some normalcy.

09:53.118 --> 09:55.453
Like sports, school, counseling.

09:57.332 --> 09:59.791
Our resources are limited,

09:59.858 --> 10:02.560
but we never turn away a guest in need.

10:05.442 --> 10:06.843
No, please.

10:07.333 --> 10:10.235
You can thank us later,
when you can spare it.

10:12.949 --> 10:14.083
Excuse me.

10:32.804 --> 10:34.750
_

10:38.398 --> 10:41.266
Is this how you and your
brother honor your cousin?

10:42.101 --> 10:43.935
My murdered son?

10:47.873 --> 10:50.742
This is about the honor of our family.

10:51.678 --> 10:52.985
Find them...

10:52.991 --> 10:55.348
The treasure hunters
and the terrorists...

10:55.354 --> 10:56.444
And kill them all.

10:56.450 --> 10:58.584
I will do it, Tio Carlo.

11:19.656 --> 11:20.856
Good morning.

11:20.924 --> 11:22.724
Morning.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.572
Good tea.

11:33.578 --> 11:35.737
It's my first try.

11:44.881 --> 11:47.883
Excuse me. Look at this.

11:50.075 --> 11:52.606
_

11:53.389 --> 11:54.955
I have been told that the camp

11:54.961 --> 11:56.630
is going to be searched today.

11:57.220 --> 11:59.084
You won't be safe here anymore.

11:59.863 --> 12:00.996
Thanks.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.265
We've got to get out of here.

12:03.271 --> 12:06.061
Come back for Cleopatra once
the chaos has died down.

12:06.569 --> 12:07.703
You see that?

12:12.342 --> 12:15.180
Look at her necklace.

12:15.186 --> 12:17.605
Cleopatra and Antony's sigil.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.782
It was on the relics at
the black market bazaar.

12:20.850 --> 12:23.819
So whoever made that
design had had contact

12:23.825 --> 12:25.759
with Cleopatra's sarcophagus?

12:25.765 --> 12:26.931
Exactly.

12:28.791 --> 12:29.992
Sit down.

12:29.998 --> 12:32.166
Let me look at that.

12:32.357 --> 12:34.677
- It's infected.
- You speak English.

12:34.691 --> 12:37.047
I studied at the University of Damascus,

12:37.053 --> 12:38.549
before the war in Syria.

12:38.555 --> 12:41.259
That's where most of the
people in this camp come from.

12:41.265 --> 12:43.800
- How long have you been here?
- A year.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.642
I'm trying to save enough
money to travel to Oslo.

12:46.648 --> 12:48.738
That's where my husband and son are.

12:49.276 --> 12:50.867
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

12:50.873 --> 12:53.143
but I heard you talking
about my necklace.

12:53.149 --> 12:55.884
Yeah, it's a fascinating design.

12:55.890 --> 12:57.147
Where did you get it?

12:57.153 --> 12:59.421
Lazlo's Jewelry Shop in the Old Medina.

12:59.489 --> 13:01.590
I work there part-time.

13:01.886 --> 13:03.825
It's a popular item.

13:03.831 --> 13:05.365
No other store carries it.

13:05.371 --> 13:07.972
We're interested in meeting
whoever designed it.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.994
The shop has been
selling them for years,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.868
well before I started working there.

13:13.178 --> 13:16.180
Well, maybe you could connect
us with the shop owner?

13:18.074 --> 13:20.842
The shop owner is not a good person.

13:20.848 --> 13:22.882
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

13:22.888 --> 13:25.247
Change the dressing every six hours.

13:32.950 --> 13:35.223
_

13:36.317 --> 13:37.788
_

13:38.262 --> 13:39.423
Aya.

13:39.429 --> 13:40.862
Aya.

13:40.930 --> 13:42.934
We need your help.

13:44.855 --> 13:47.879
Did you hear about the
terrorist attack on the pyramid?

13:48.223 --> 13:49.425
Of course.

13:49.485 --> 13:51.935
Well, the information we
are looking for can stop

13:51.941 --> 13:53.642
the next attack from happening.

13:54.077 --> 13:57.045
We have a feeling your
boss may be able to help.

13:57.610 --> 13:59.360
You're from Syria.

13:59.491 --> 14:01.142
I'm from Egypt.

14:01.434 --> 14:03.418
We both have seen destruction.

14:03.424 --> 14:05.725
We've both lost people we love.

14:05.855 --> 14:07.155
All we want

14:07.223 --> 14:08.580
is to stop the same thing from

14:08.586 --> 14:10.116
happening to somebody else.

14:16.366 --> 14:18.500
The man you're looking
for is Salim Le Mer.

14:19.664 --> 14:21.432
He's very powerful.

14:21.804 --> 14:24.840
- He must not know I told you.
- I understand.

14:24.846 --> 14:28.015
We will protect you from him,
you have my word.

14:28.021 --> 14:29.339
Where can we find him?

14:29.345 --> 14:31.680
Hello. I'm calling about the reward.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.866
Agent Karlsson, I presume?

14:37.872 --> 14:39.734
Ramin Hamza, chief of police.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.754
Where can I set up shop?

14:41.760 --> 14:44.878
Please, you are our guest.

14:45.077 --> 14:47.466
- How about some tea?
- We have too much work to do.

14:47.472 --> 14:48.672
We don't have time for tea.

14:48.740 --> 14:50.807
Where are you in your
search for Danny and Lexi?

14:51.233 --> 14:53.026
I have ordered checkpoints

14:53.032 --> 14:54.573
in every district in Morocco.

14:54.579 --> 14:55.919
No one will come or go

14:55.925 --> 14:58.152
without having to go past my officers.

14:58.550 --> 15:00.879
The entire country is on high alert.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.621
When Mr. McNamara
and Ms. Vaziri surface...

15:05.562 --> 15:06.985
They will be found.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.527
I don't think the world will
end because Gwen Karlsson

15:10.533 --> 15:12.529
had an unscheduled cup of tea.

15:12.597 --> 15:14.364
So you want us to wait?

15:16.202 --> 15:17.768
Hey.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.666
They've been spotted.

15:32.785 --> 15:35.053
That must be Le Mer's office.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.527
Yup. Okay.

15:37.533 --> 15:39.467
I've got this one.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.674
_

15:44.728 --> 15:47.689
_

15:47.695 --> 15:49.600
_

15:50.822 --> 15:53.881
_

15:54.074 --> 15:56.331
_

15:57.342 --> 15:58.976
Get lost.

16:00.111 --> 16:01.445
Uh...

16:06.017 --> 16:07.484
Nailed it.

16:07.490 --> 16:09.858
Let's take a minute,
figure out what to do.

16:15.968 --> 16:17.734
_

16:17.740 --> 16:19.890
_

16:25.196 --> 16:28.929
So... we can't get out of the city,

16:28.935 --> 16:32.571
can't find Cleopatra,
Farouk is still out there.

16:32.639 --> 16:34.473
We got cops trying to arrest us

16:34.479 --> 16:37.348
and mobsters trying to kill us.

16:41.288 --> 16:42.855
I'm all out of ideas.

16:42.861 --> 16:44.249
You?

16:44.714 --> 16:47.382
Is that Shaw?

16:57.319 --> 16:58.886
Of all the gin joints...

16:58.892 --> 17:00.154
Oh, no.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.756
Hustling cougars, Shaw?

17:01.762 --> 17:03.474
These ladies come here for a little

17:03.480 --> 17:05.362
adventure in their humdrum lives,

17:05.598 --> 17:07.867
and I give them the full Casablanca.

17:07.873 --> 17:09.740
I don't even want to
know what that means.

17:09.746 --> 17:11.246
I mean the experience.

17:11.309 --> 17:12.960
And considering I just got my life back

17:12.965 --> 17:14.569
together after you two blew it up...

17:14.575 --> 17:16.871
I saved your life. Twice.

17:16.877 --> 17:19.178
And nearly got me killed. Three times.

17:19.308 --> 17:20.540
So move along,

17:20.547 --> 17:22.241
before you ruin everything again.

17:22.247 --> 17:25.313
Absolutely, soon as we get
a meeting with Salim Le Mer.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.575
What's your relationship with him?

17:26.580 --> 17:27.748
We have an arrangement.

17:27.753 --> 17:30.856
I bring a fantasy
experience to his customers,

17:31.110 --> 17:33.478
and he helps himself
to a reasonable cut.

17:33.484 --> 17:35.418
So he's your pimp?

17:35.424 --> 17:38.193
No. Wait... No.

17:38.582 --> 17:40.690
Doesn't matter. We need
to meet with La Mer.

17:40.696 --> 17:42.868
Make it happen, we'll
get out of your hair.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.705
No. You two smell like trash right now.

17:45.772 --> 17:48.535
As in you literally been
rolling around in the garbage.

17:48.541 --> 17:50.710
We think Cleopatra is in Casablanca.

17:50.716 --> 17:52.710
Yeah, yeah, I heard that noise before.

17:52.716 --> 17:54.033
But what you haven't heard

17:54.039 --> 17:56.043
is that the Egyptians and Reece

17:56.049 --> 17:58.417
are now offering a
handsome finder's fee.

17:58.423 --> 17:59.714
- Say what now?
- Mm-hmm.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.320
Which means when we find her,

18:01.388 --> 18:04.337
Le Mer is gonna get real pissed
knowing you're the reason

18:04.343 --> 18:06.396
he didn't get a piece of the action.

18:08.996 --> 18:10.496
All right.

18:10.564 --> 18:13.056
But let's get you two cleaned up first.

18:13.630 --> 18:15.164
Oh...

18:21.143 --> 18:22.685
Can I ask you something?

18:22.691 --> 18:24.085
Would it matter if I said no?

18:24.091 --> 18:25.758
What do you see in Danny, anyway?

18:25.764 --> 18:28.491
He's a nice dude and
all, but at his core...

18:29.147 --> 18:30.983
He's a house cat.

18:32.061 --> 18:34.395
But you got tiger energy.

18:34.401 --> 18:36.015
You need another tiger.

18:36.021 --> 18:38.494
Hmm, let me guess...
You're the other tiger.

18:38.578 --> 18:40.523
I can't be the only one to notice

18:40.529 --> 18:42.338
that our chemistry is off the charts.

18:42.619 --> 18:44.672
That's because it's nonexistent.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.241
Damn, girl.

18:46.691 --> 18:48.626
Pure tiger.

18:50.579 --> 18:52.978
We both know you two
are never gonna work.

18:53.689 --> 18:55.377
What do you think's gonna happen

18:55.383 --> 18:57.123
when the law catches up to you?

18:57.186 --> 18:59.314
I mean, Danny...

18:59.370 --> 19:02.238
He'll get a slap on
the wrist. But you...

19:02.244 --> 19:04.066
With your rap sheet...

19:05.618 --> 19:07.853
You got to start thinking
about your future.

19:07.859 --> 19:09.393
Hmm.

19:09.765 --> 19:11.882
I'm proposing a merger.

19:12.820 --> 19:15.591
That's the worst line I've ever heard.

19:16.765 --> 19:19.366
A business merger.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.010
Soon as I get my
Cleopatra money, I'm out.

19:22.077 --> 19:25.013
In fact, I'm making
arrangements as we speak.

19:27.206 --> 19:29.055
You're invited to join me.

19:29.061 --> 19:31.141
We'll keep it just business,

19:31.147 --> 19:33.823
but you'll be in
business with a tiger...

19:35.224 --> 19:37.027
Not a cat.

19:37.033 --> 19:38.433
Think about it.

19:38.448 --> 19:39.982
You ready?

19:40.898 --> 19:42.397
What'd I miss?

19:42.464 --> 19:43.831
Oh, nothing.

20:12.496 --> 20:13.983
Whoever you are, I can assure

20:13.989 --> 20:15.500
you there's no need to get rough.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.498
I'm a great advocate of diplomacy.

20:17.504 --> 20:19.939
I'll tell you whatever you need to know.

20:19.990 --> 20:22.491
But also, there's nothing
that you can do to me

20:22.497 --> 20:24.295
that hasn't been done already.

20:28.077 --> 20:30.078
Where did you get this?

20:30.145 --> 20:33.114
I seduced a tycoon who
deals in blood antiquities.

20:33.182 --> 20:35.664
Her name is Jessica Wong.
She lives in London.

20:36.179 --> 20:37.509
England.

20:37.515 --> 20:38.915
I could give you her phone number...

20:38.921 --> 20:40.355
So you stole it?

20:40.422 --> 20:43.791
I give generously, so I take generously.

20:45.508 --> 20:47.375
What are you after?

20:47.381 --> 20:48.915
Legitimacy.

20:49.147 --> 20:51.432
But I'll settle for loads of money.

20:51.438 --> 20:53.239
You see how forthcoming I am?

20:53.245 --> 20:55.913
You ask me what you need to know,

20:55.919 --> 20:58.573
and if it's within my
power, I will tell you.

21:01.204 --> 21:03.572
You've been talking to Lexi Vaziri.

21:03.578 --> 21:05.085
Filling her head with lies.

21:05.185 --> 21:06.913
What is your interest in her?

21:06.919 --> 21:08.316
Personally or professionally?

21:09.538 --> 21:12.013
Personally, I find her mesmerizing.

21:12.019 --> 21:14.322
Professionally, I'm betting
she'll be the first person

21:14.328 --> 21:16.662
to find Cleopatra, so if
I aid her in that quest,

21:16.668 --> 21:18.299
perhaps I can share in the windfall.

21:18.305 --> 21:20.906
I can sing like a canary
all night, only...

21:21.063 --> 21:24.332
I don't suppose you got, like,
a mineral water or something?

21:24.338 --> 21:26.339
If I'm being really
honest, like, a gin a tonic

21:26.345 --> 21:28.513
would really hit the spot right now.

21:45.421 --> 21:47.121
Mr. Le Mer.

21:47.127 --> 21:49.425
These are the people
I messaged you about.

21:49.431 --> 21:50.598
Carlo Velardi...

21:50.826 --> 21:53.361
Has a bounty on their heads.

21:53.367 --> 21:54.557
How much?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.197
One million.

21:56.203 --> 21:57.803
Damn. A million.

21:57.809 --> 22:00.010
What our associate means is...

22:00.936 --> 22:02.303
We can offer you more.

22:02.371 --> 22:05.773
Oh? I'm currently in
negotiation with Carlo

22:05.841 --> 22:08.443
for double that, so...

22:08.510 --> 22:10.812
You have precisely two
minutes to convince me

22:10.818 --> 22:12.332
you can get me more.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.508
There is a necklace that's
only sold at your shop.

22:16.583 --> 22:19.385
That design is part of
an ancient artifact.

22:19.391 --> 22:22.459
An artifact that we believe is
somewhere here in Casablanca.

22:22.597 --> 22:24.865
Tell him about the reward money.

22:24.871 --> 22:26.027
Oh...

22:27.129 --> 22:29.774
If you can tell us who
designed it, we can find it.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.414
You'll get a significant finder's fee,

22:31.420 --> 22:33.234
courtesy of the Egyptian government.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.074
Tens of millions.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.380
All legal.

22:36.386 --> 22:37.686
No headaches.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.842
Hmm.

22:44.213 --> 22:47.050
If you'll excuse me, my
next set is about to start.

22:50.090 --> 22:52.591
I'm sending some of my men with you.

22:52.597 --> 22:55.351
If I find that this is, uh...

22:55.924 --> 22:57.625
A waste of my time...

22:58.927 --> 23:01.062
None of you will escape Casablanca.

23:14.931 --> 23:16.765
Salaam.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.880
We were sent by Le Mer.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.083
Ah. Hmm.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.042
Mr. Le Mer honors us with his guests.

23:25.300 --> 23:26.795
What brings you here tonight?

23:26.801 --> 23:29.482
Do you recognize this necklace?

23:29.853 --> 23:31.621
- Mm-hmm.
- It's an eagle.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.737
Wings spread with hieroglyphs.

23:33.743 --> 23:35.699
Yes. It's from my mother's shop.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.452
The one Le Mer took...

23:37.947 --> 23:40.080
Uh... bought. Bought from us.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.203
- Do you know who designed it?
- I did.

23:42.928 --> 23:45.806
My father Hassan was
enamored with the design.

23:45.874 --> 23:47.550
To honor his memory,

23:47.556 --> 23:49.649
I made it into jewelry.

23:51.947 --> 23:53.214
Oh, oh...

23:53.282 --> 23:55.542
Can't you see my man's
wheels are turning?

23:56.852 --> 23:59.954
My father and his brother Salim.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.788
When was this picture taken?

24:01.794 --> 24:03.257
The year they died.

24:04.156 --> 24:05.893
1945.

24:05.961 --> 24:08.429
That's an interesting coincidence.

24:09.426 --> 24:12.929
Do you know when your father
first saw this design?

24:13.951 --> 24:16.771
I don't know where, but I remember when.

24:17.568 --> 24:19.312
He and my uncle

24:19.318 --> 24:21.509
came home late from the ports.

24:21.577 --> 24:23.701
I couldn't sleep.

24:23.707 --> 24:25.813
Not with all the noise downstairs.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.335
What noise?

24:27.341 --> 24:28.923
Construction.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.352
They work through the nights.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.685
And in the morning, I saw

24:34.691 --> 24:35.990
this counter.

24:39.361 --> 24:41.362
After that night...

24:41.430 --> 24:43.264
They had changed.

24:43.332 --> 24:45.266
They began to fight all the time.

24:45.334 --> 24:46.904
A few weeks later,

24:46.910 --> 24:48.547
they killed each other,

24:48.553 --> 24:50.112
and nobody knew why.

24:50.118 --> 24:52.519
Like they were cursed.

24:52.841 --> 24:56.544
In 1945, some Nazis

24:56.550 --> 24:59.285
escaped Europe through Casablanca.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.008
They brought with them

25:01.014 --> 25:02.851
an ancient object they believed

25:02.857 --> 25:04.455
to contain immense power.

25:04.620 --> 25:08.204
On the night your father and
uncle built this counter,

25:08.210 --> 25:10.303
I believe it was to conceal that object.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.737
They must have planned to hide

25:11.743 --> 25:13.356
it away until the heat died down

25:13.362 --> 25:16.530
- so they could sell it later.
- Nobody move!

25:21.770 --> 25:23.070
Gwen.

25:23.138 --> 25:24.305
She's here.

25:25.574 --> 25:27.208
Cleopatra?

25:27.276 --> 25:30.845
Yeah. Look, i-if I'm wrong,
you can take us in.

25:34.203 --> 25:36.704
I just need to borrow your shotgun.

25:53.468 --> 25:56.170
Let's tear this thing apart.

26:21.448 --> 26:22.549
Damn it.

26:22.555 --> 26:25.276
- It's just the outer sarcophagus.
- What does that mean?

26:25.282 --> 26:27.884
Egyptian sarcophagi had multiple layers,

26:27.890 --> 26:29.470
like Russian nesting dolls.

26:29.538 --> 26:31.572
This is just the outer casing.

26:31.702 --> 26:33.369
She's still out there somewhere.

26:33.375 --> 26:36.410
Of course. Her father
and uncle saw no value

26:36.416 --> 26:37.816
in keeping the coffin,

26:37.822 --> 26:39.447
so they let the Nazis leave with her

26:39.453 --> 26:41.488
and kept the gold casing for themselves.

26:41.616 --> 26:44.218
Okay, we need to lock
this place down. Now.

26:44.286 --> 26:46.787
Wait, if-if Farouk thinks
we've found Cleopatra,

26:46.855 --> 26:48.889
he'll send someone for her.

26:49.286 --> 26:51.678
He doesn't know the
sarcophagus is empty.

26:51.684 --> 26:53.994
- So you want this news to get out?
- No.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.669
I want us to leak it so it
reaches an audience of one.

26:57.961 --> 27:01.130
This is one of Le Mer's
properties seized by the police,

27:01.136 --> 27:03.203
so the two of you can
stay here for the night.

27:03.325 --> 27:05.293
- Where's Le Mer?
- In jail.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.341
His men turned on him.

27:07.401 --> 27:10.104
Oh, I could get used to this.

27:10.110 --> 27:11.990
There are officers stationed outside.

27:11.996 --> 27:13.486
If it was up to me,

27:13.492 --> 27:15.480
the two of you would
be in a holding cell.

27:15.574 --> 27:16.679
But...

27:16.685 --> 27:18.753
Chief Hamza...

27:18.820 --> 27:20.955
Is big on hospitality.

27:21.022 --> 27:22.623
I will send for you in the morning,

27:22.629 --> 27:24.430
and let's see if Farouk
has taken the bait.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.671
In the meantime, stay out of trouble.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.358
Gwen.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.614
Thanks.

27:39.636 --> 27:42.271
She still mad I kicked her ass?

27:42.277 --> 27:44.512
Mm, seemed like a draw to me.

27:45.881 --> 27:48.816
- What are you doing?
- It's a stash house.

27:48.822 --> 27:51.223
I'm looking for his stash.

27:51.353 --> 27:54.555
Guys like Le Mer always
have rainy-day money

27:54.623 --> 27:56.490
hidden away somewhere.

27:56.558 --> 27:59.226
I'm sure they've
already swept the place.

28:01.296 --> 28:03.898
Le Mer sure knows how to live.

28:04.215 --> 28:07.551
Today, we brought down a local kingpin.

28:08.349 --> 28:11.050
Maybe tomorrow we catch Farouk.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.757
Not a bad day.

28:15.544 --> 28:17.478
Here's looking at you, kid.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.147
I...

28:20.215 --> 28:22.817
You know, watched some clips online.

28:26.254 --> 28:27.388
Hmm.

28:31.350 --> 28:32.550
Hmm.

28:52.681 --> 28:55.115
Thought you got lost in there.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.118
What's that?

29:02.290 --> 29:04.525
Le Mer's secret stash.

29:04.593 --> 29:06.193
You got to be kidding me.

29:06.261 --> 29:07.428
Nope.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.530
Told you I'd find it.

29:09.598 --> 29:12.797
- That's a lot of cash.
- Mm-hmm.

29:13.635 --> 29:15.703
Go a long way in Belize.

29:15.770 --> 29:17.571
Thailand.

29:17.639 --> 29:19.540
Boracay.

29:19.669 --> 29:20.936
Maldives.

29:20.942 --> 29:23.723
- You know we can't keep this.
- I know.

29:24.546 --> 29:27.748
Can't we just daydream for a minute?

29:29.284 --> 29:30.885
Hey.

29:30.952 --> 29:33.153
If you could go anywhere...

29:33.541 --> 29:35.709
Be with anyone, do anything...

29:36.316 --> 29:38.250
Where would you go?

29:38.660 --> 29:40.561
You want the truth?

29:40.629 --> 29:43.564
I'd expect nothing less
from Danny McNamara.

29:45.798 --> 29:47.899
No place I'd rather be.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.337
You're drunk.

29:50.405 --> 29:51.772
I'm buzzed.

29:52.494 --> 29:54.041
But it's still true.

29:58.246 --> 29:59.898
My dad...

30:00.365 --> 30:03.283
Always said we were
right for each other.

30:04.019 --> 30:06.353
On good days, I agree.

30:06.421 --> 30:08.289
And the bad ones?

30:12.060 --> 30:15.362
I wonder if we're more like...

30:15.430 --> 30:18.666
Mark Antony and Cleopatra.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.334
Star-crossed.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.636
Doomed. Cursed.

30:23.521 --> 30:25.200
Oh, that's a bit dramatic.

30:25.206 --> 30:27.974
Need I run through our history?

30:30.014 --> 30:31.447
You know...

30:33.515 --> 30:36.016
You know, we're not
the same people we were

30:36.473 --> 30:38.619
when we first met.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.222
So who are we?

31:09.522 --> 31:12.925
Was that a really bad idea?

31:13.203 --> 31:15.315
I don't know.

31:15.883 --> 31:18.185
I feel pretty good about it.

31:19.221 --> 31:20.225
You?

31:23.488 --> 31:25.522
What if it works?

31:27.211 --> 31:29.946
The sting to catch Farouk.

31:29.952 --> 31:32.053
What does tomorrow look like?

31:32.059 --> 31:34.026
Or the day after.

31:35.799 --> 31:37.733
Well...

31:37.739 --> 31:40.374
I've had some time to think about it.

31:40.380 --> 31:41.547
Oh.

31:41.730 --> 31:45.466
I... still got my law
practice in New York.

31:45.925 --> 31:49.394
- Mm.
- My... tiny apartment.

31:51.208 --> 31:53.309
I guess I could find a larger apartment,

31:53.666 --> 31:55.478
big enough for two.

31:56.188 --> 31:59.290
I do like New York.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.252
I've never actually had a job.

32:01.258 --> 32:02.962
Would I be your...

32:04.243 --> 32:05.978
Secretary?

32:07.447 --> 32:09.648
You'd be a terrible secretary.

32:09.716 --> 32:11.283
Hey!

32:13.822 --> 32:15.823
What about you? What's...

32:15.829 --> 32:18.130
Tomorrow look like?

32:19.628 --> 32:22.897
Well, I've never been much for planning.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.933
And right now, I'm going for a swim.

32:56.107 --> 33:00.255
_

33:13.847 --> 33:15.247
Here we are.

33:15.343 --> 33:18.478
Casablanca is three hours to the south.

33:18.546 --> 33:21.548
My man on the Moroccan Police Force says

33:21.554 --> 33:23.655
that's where your Cleopatra was found.

33:23.661 --> 33:25.028
Here.

33:28.453 --> 33:30.755
Pleasure doing business with you.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.324
You said you'd have a car to take you

33:33.330 --> 33:35.097
- the rest of the way.
- I do.

33:36.464 --> 33:38.465
Get out.

33:38.533 --> 33:40.026
Whoa.

33:40.050 --> 33:42.948
_

33:44.205 --> 33:45.739
Okay, okay.

33:59.632 --> 34:01.099
Hey!

34:11.114 --> 34:13.181
Why do you have a burner phone?

34:13.295 --> 34:15.739
Are you going through my stuff?

34:15.746 --> 34:17.471
You've been spying on me.

34:17.954 --> 34:19.873
No.

34:19.879 --> 34:21.284
No, it's not like that.

34:21.291 --> 34:24.409
I just read a play-by-play
of the last 72 hours.

34:25.014 --> 34:28.481
You're working behind my
back with somebody else.

34:28.844 --> 34:30.411
Who is it?

34:32.887 --> 34:35.222
I... I can't tell you.

34:35.289 --> 34:38.225
But I'd appreciate a little trust.

34:38.231 --> 34:39.728
We're supposed to be partners.

34:39.734 --> 34:41.181
Looks like you already have one.

34:41.187 --> 34:44.283
What I have are sources and assets.

34:44.289 --> 34:45.598
Which am I?

34:45.603 --> 34:47.237
Come on.

34:47.244 --> 34:48.768
Who are you working with?

34:48.775 --> 34:50.532
Don't interrogate me, Danny.

34:50.538 --> 34:52.505
I'm not your C.I. anymore.

34:52.511 --> 34:54.603
- Is it Simon Hardwick?
- Oh, I see.

34:54.609 --> 34:57.344
- You think very highly of me.
- Can you blame me?

34:57.350 --> 34:59.040
Just last night you said we're not

34:59.046 --> 35:00.714
the same people we were when we met.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.621
Well, maybe I never
really knew who you were.

35:02.627 --> 35:04.862
- Then what are we?
- What we've always been.

35:05.052 --> 35:06.386
A mistake.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.497
I don't trust you to be
a part of this sting.

35:11.503 --> 35:13.827
You're staying here.

35:41.301 --> 35:44.862
_

36:09.746 --> 36:11.313
Where's Lexi?

36:11.319 --> 36:12.986
She's a liability.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.845
I made the call to leave
her behind at the house.

36:15.851 --> 36:17.284
Good.

36:17.558 --> 36:18.959
Welcome back.

36:28.069 --> 36:30.148
You still think they're coming?

36:30.154 --> 36:32.067
We found a smuggler outside Tangier

36:32.073 --> 36:33.606
who was able to ID Omar.

36:33.674 --> 36:35.141
They left him there for dead.

36:35.209 --> 36:36.609
That's him.

36:36.677 --> 36:37.811
That's Omar.

36:37.817 --> 36:40.167
You can't even see his face.

36:40.346 --> 36:43.127
That burn. We gave it to him.

36:45.485 --> 36:47.586
For Carlo Velardi.

36:49.911 --> 36:52.220
Police! You are under arrest!

37:05.039 --> 37:06.342
Hey!

37:50.785 --> 37:52.819
You're under arrest.

38:03.230 --> 38:04.731
Where's Lexi?

38:04.799 --> 38:06.733
She was right behind me.

38:22.632 --> 38:24.099
Where you taking Omar?

38:24.105 --> 38:25.305
To Rome.

38:25.411 --> 38:28.112
See if we can squeeze
him to flip on Farouk.

38:28.383 --> 38:29.750
Thanks to you.

38:29.756 --> 38:31.690
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

38:33.721 --> 38:35.822
Can you do me one last favor?

38:36.307 --> 38:37.838
Depends.

38:37.844 --> 38:39.612
Can you trace this for me?

38:40.813 --> 38:42.107
It's one of Lexi's underworld

38:42.113 --> 38:43.668
contacts she's been texting with.

38:43.674 --> 38:45.633
I found the number on her burner phone.

38:47.428 --> 38:48.762
See what I can do.

38:51.222 --> 38:52.689
I'm sorry, Danny.

38:52.695 --> 38:54.625
Don't be. It's for the best.

38:55.183 --> 38:57.252
- Not about her.
- Whoa, whoa.

38:57.258 --> 38:59.192
- Thought we were good.
- Yeah, we're good.

38:59.413 --> 39:01.680
But the FBI wants to talk to you.

39:01.748 --> 39:03.949
I have orders to take you back to Rome

39:04.017 --> 39:05.651
under armed guard.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.355
They didn't tell me anything else.

39:26.373 --> 39:28.007
Grazie, amico.

39:29.615 --> 39:31.210
What for?

39:32.404 --> 39:35.877
For capturing my son's killer.

39:38.285 --> 39:40.753
I'm sorry to have blamed you.

39:40.821 --> 39:42.588
The bounty is off.

39:42.656 --> 39:47.264
In fact, you're under my
protection now, so come on.

39:47.270 --> 39:49.237
Cheer up.

39:49.718 --> 39:51.397
Who knows...

39:51.465 --> 39:54.066
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

39:57.704 --> 40:01.540
This has been a very strange day.

40:24.598 --> 40:27.433
Uh... uh, who are you?

40:27.501 --> 40:29.435
I am Aya.

40:32.506 --> 40:34.039
"This is my friend Aya.

40:34.107 --> 40:35.661
"Take her to her family in Oslo.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.939
"I trust you will do this
because if you don't,

40:38.945 --> 40:41.447
"I will hunt you down and kill you.

40:41.515 --> 40:44.416
"Till next time."

40:45.485 --> 40:48.287
Tigers got to be tigers.

40:52.829 --> 40:54.260
Let's get out of here.

40:54.642 --> 40:56.629
Looks like it's just you and me.

40:58.773 --> 41:00.373
I'm Shaw.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.768
Nice to meet you.

41:18.210 --> 41:20.562
_

41:51.284 --> 41:52.718
Where'd you find her?

41:52.786 --> 41:54.053
I didn't.

41:54.775 --> 41:56.877
She turned herself in.

42:16.443 --> 42:19.612
Fabi, what did you learn
from your interrogation?

42:19.618 --> 42:23.154
Hardwick is just
another treasure hunter.

42:23.283 --> 42:24.850
I let him go.

42:24.918 --> 42:26.157
He knows better than to stick

42:26.163 --> 42:27.658
his nose where it doesn't belong.

42:27.721 --> 42:29.192
And the girl...

42:29.198 --> 42:31.619
Does she know the truth
about her father's death?

42:31.625 --> 42:34.560
No. Nor will she.
