WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:02.703
Hey.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.307
I wanna sit right here.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.709
- I don't know what you do,
but I don't do that.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.311
- I'ma sit next to you, then.
- All right.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.712
You gonna trap
another unit at me?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.781
- No, today I'm taking
a different approach, you know?

00:15.383 --> 00:16.317
- It's--I'm gonna become--

00:16.417 --> 00:18.252
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:18.352 --> 00:19.420
Hand gotta go.
- All right, well,

00:19.520 --> 00:20.821
I'm gonna go and sign in.
- Okay.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.223
- But you know, it was really
good seeing you, though.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.658
- Ah, again, you're doing
the touching thing.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.960
That's--thank you,
I'm flattered.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.530
But really, not interested.
Thank you.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.166
He knows I'm married, right?

00:34.402 --> 00:36.070
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:36.170 --> 00:38.439
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:38.539 --> 00:39.940
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.942
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.277
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.612
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:44.712 --> 00:46.314
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:46.414 --> 00:47.848
- You shut your face.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.017
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.185
- We're back, baby!

00:55.323 --> 00:57.591
- So far, my day has not
gone great.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.059
Lots of things
have gone wrong.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.794
I got really sunburned
yesterday.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.296
Took me forever to find
a parking spot

01:02.396 --> 01:03.397
where I was gonna
get my coffee.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.366
I'm running extremely late.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.635
Spilled coffee on myself
on the way to the auction.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.370
And I forgot my sunglasses.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.672
But every time I've been here,
I've had an awesome auction.

01:11.772 --> 01:15.109
So I'm really hoping Moreno
Valley comes through today

01:15.209 --> 01:16.510
and turns my day around.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.979
'Cause so far--

01:19.079 --> 01:20.448
- Every time I go
to Moreno Valley,

01:20.548 --> 01:21.649
I find something cool.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.751
Today, I'm looking
for super cool.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.053
The big, the funky
the unusual.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.356
The stuff that makes people
wanna stop in your shop,

01:28.456 --> 01:30.158
they take a second look,
they come back the next day

01:30.258 --> 01:32.493
and take a look again--
that's what I'm looking for.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.796
Big, cool and funky?
Sounds like somebody I know.

01:35.896 --> 01:39.032
It's gonna be there.
I can feel it in my bones.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.634
- I've been doing a lot
of talking lately,

01:40.734 --> 01:42.470
you know, getting people upset.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.104
But I'm gonna be
the nice guy today.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.539
Try and throw some compliments
to these guys

01:45.639 --> 01:46.674
and get them off
their A game.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.008
I'm all about the angle.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.777
And I'll do what it takes
to get what I want.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.379
If it goes the right way,
yeah, maybe I can

01:51.479 --> 01:53.147
get a unit for cheap.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.882
- Times have really
changed for me.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.084
I'm pretty much doing this
all on my own.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.652
And all these young
whippersnappers,

01:58.752 --> 02:00.221
they come in here,
they're giving me

02:00.321 --> 02:01.822
a good run for my money.

02:01.922 --> 02:05.626
And I'm just no spring pigeon--
spring anything.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.861
I don't even have
any spring in my board.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.798
I've always been grumpy,
but now I'm grumpy and old.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.366
Get off my yard.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.467
But you know what?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.135
This old man ain't giving up.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.171
I'm still out there,
I'm buying on my own,

02:17.271 --> 02:18.706
I'm still making a living,

02:18.806 --> 02:20.341
and I'm still having fun.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.810
I've had two double caffeinated
iced teas

02:22.910 --> 02:24.812
and I'm ready to roll.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.113
What's up, fellas?

02:26.214 --> 02:27.881
Trying to buy me
some loving today.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.550
- Whoo!
- Hey, donuts.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.654
- I need a good locker.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.088
You guys got--
what are you doing?

02:35.189 --> 02:36.490
Come on, get up here.
- Oh, wow, it's Christmas.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.591
- I'm trying to diet.
- It's Christmas.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.859
Look at this.
- No, come on.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.094
You're not on a diet.
- A seafood diet.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.564
- Whoo! Look at those.
- Yeah.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.366
- All right.
- These are organic donuts.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.201
- They are glucofage free.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.769
- Hold on, Rene.
- I'll pay you 20 bucks

02:48.869 --> 02:50.704
if you eat the whole box.
- Rene.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.274
Rene, I said eat a donut;

02:53.374 --> 02:55.276
don't suck the thing down
in one bite.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.844
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.212
- Good morning, everybody.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.880
My name is Emily. I'm gonna be
your auctioneer today.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.615
Once we get in there,
I'm gonna open the door.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.384
You guys can't go in
and you can't touch anything,

03:03.484 --> 03:04.685
but you will all get a chance

03:04.785 --> 03:06.186
to look and see
what's inside the units.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.456
And if you guys are ready
to see the units, so am I.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.090
Let's go!

03:10.190 --> 03:11.292
- Let's do it!

03:11.392 --> 03:12.693
- Hey, why you walking
all weird?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.995
- I went to the beach yesterday

03:15.095 --> 03:17.865
and I now look like a lobster.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.533
- Oh, so you sat
in the sun too long.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.035
- Yeah.
- I never get that problem.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.471
- All the way down--

03:23.571 --> 03:25.806
- Ah! Ahh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.242
- Ow!

03:28.342 --> 03:31.779
15 by 10, here we go!

03:31.879 --> 03:32.880
- Whoo!

03:32.980 --> 03:35.316
*

03:35.416 --> 03:37.084
- Satellite boxes, so the guy
probably was installing

03:37.184 --> 03:38.519
satellites at one time.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.820
There's extra parts
for that stuff.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.888
Which actually doesn't
really have value.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.223
Nobody buys that.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.158
- Looks like a bunch of crap
that somebody

03:45.259 --> 03:47.561
just piled in here and made
a pretty locker out of it.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.663
Hey, sometimes you gotta
take a gamble.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.799
And they don't call me
the gambler for nothing.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.268
- That thing right there,
go 300 bucks brand new.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.438
I usually put that on my app
and, you know, put it for 150.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.006
Make my money back on that.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.342
- It's a mish-mash of
everything, is what I see.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.876
Nothing that's great,
nothing that's awesome.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.144
Just mish-mash.
- Ivy, what do you got

04:04.244 --> 04:06.013
all over your elbow?

04:06.113 --> 04:07.915
- Well--

04:08.015 --> 04:10.984
- I'm trying to be like y'all.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.019
- All righty,
here you go, guys.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.254
Got a nice 15 by 10 here.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.632
- 25.
- 25, now 30.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.505
- Sell it. No one wants it.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.107
- Sold it to you, $25, Darrell.
$25

04:34.207 --> 04:35.743
- Saved you some breath, there.

04:35.843 --> 04:36.977
25 bucks.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.813
I spent more on
the donuts this morning.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.316
I stole this when all those
young ducks

04:42.416 --> 04:44.718
were sitting on their feathers,
whatever.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.920
I'm gonna make a lot of profit
on this locker.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.922
I can tell you that, right now.

04:49.022 --> 04:52.526
$10 for the chair.
$10 for the bookcase.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.728
Looks like a whole
bedroom set's in here.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.030
Rails, the bed, everything.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.635
That's a $50 bill, right there.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.805
Fragile. Tubes.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.907
What kinda tubes?

05:07.007 --> 05:08.542
Now these are some
type of electric--

05:08.642 --> 05:10.043
these are Raytheon.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.481
Wow. You know,
just right off the gate,

05:13.581 --> 05:16.016
I can tell you these are worth
getting checked out.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.051
This is a whole
tube collection.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.554
Some of these tubes can be
very valuable.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.556
So I'm gonna set these aside,
right here.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.857
Get those checked out.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.026
A jigsaw, some oil.

05:26.126 --> 05:30.030
All that stuff's
about another ten bucks.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.266
Oh, wow.
Look at this thing.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.904
This is pretty cool.
Space Age mini TV.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.739
Does it look like it's been
taken apart

05:38.839 --> 05:40.140
or something like that?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.576
It's all chipped up, broken up.
What a shame.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.311
Those things are actually
really collectable.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.179
Too bad it's in such
rough shape.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.982
That'd be about $100 bill,
right there, if it wasn't.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.018
About a $30 bill.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.622
Some techno guy'll want that
just for parts.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.223
Uh--ahh.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.826
What the heck is this?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.734
Uh-huh.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.969
This is a tube tester.
This guy must've been

06:09.069 --> 06:11.038
some kinda collector
or something like that.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.272
Into tubes.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.674
Hopefully this thing's
worth some money.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.208
I'm gonna put it
with the tubes.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.844
This is really cool.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.278
There's a set of
bunk beds in here.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.648
That's 50 bucks
for the bunk beds.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.215
This is a nice little dish

06:22.315 --> 06:25.118
with all the mounting hardware
and everything on it.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.855
These dishes are probably worth
a good 40 bucks apiece.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.256
We've got one, two, three.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.758
There's 120 bucks.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.427
There's a real nice
electric stove right here, too.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.928
That's another hundred bucks.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.029
Let's see what these are.
It looks like

06:36.129 --> 06:37.631
they're mounting brackets.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.733
Universal for any dish
right here.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.402
So nine boxes right there,
alone.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.906
At 40 bucks apiece,
that's $360.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.175
Those young kids can
take those big lockers.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.343
I'm happy with
my little locker today.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.513
I did nothing but make money.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.082
Oh, yeah, my tubes. I gotta go
get these checked out

06:55.182 --> 06:57.451
so I wanna put these
in a nice, safe place.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.887
Then I can get right back
to the auction.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.055
And go mess with Rene.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.294
- All right, guys.
We got a 10 by 30.

07:07.394 --> 07:10.598
Are you ready?

07:10.698 --> 07:12.800
- So we got an old
video game system there.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.167
I like the cord
and the old nozzles.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.336
I mean, that's probably
from the late '80s.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.938
- A lot of collectables
in here.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.006
This thing's deep.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.541
You know, this one right here,

07:20.641 --> 07:21.575
you might be able to find
the big ticket item

07:21.675 --> 07:22.610
that everyone's looking for.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.211
So I'm very interested.

07:24.311 --> 07:27.548
Time to break out
Mr. Nice Guy.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.216
Tell you how nice
you look today, Emily.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.918
- Oh, gee, thanks.
- You're very nice.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.354
- No, I'm just throwing
compliments out there.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.223
- Mm, I don't think so.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.625
One of the best auctioneers
I've ever met.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.392
- Well, that I believe.
- Ever.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.028
- Ever, well, yeah.
- By far.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.362
Smooth.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.164
*

07:44.264 --> 07:45.666
- I actually like this room,

07:45.766 --> 07:48.235
but Rene never shows any mercy
on this stuff,

07:48.335 --> 07:50.938
you know what I mean?

07:51.038 --> 07:52.973
You owe me a favor.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.407
- Yeah.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.144
- Must be a good locker.
- Yeah.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.479
I know Rene'll pay
anything for this locker,

07:59.580 --> 08:03.083
so I'm gonna make sure
he pays everything.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.985
- Marble top desk drawer.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.688
Right up front, it's a "Kick 'N
Catch" little arcade machine.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.389
I like this unit.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.191
- Yeah!

08:11.291 --> 08:13.360
700.
- Yeah.

08:15.128 --> 08:18.265
- Yeah.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.800
900.
- Yeah.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.102
- Damn, you're at
my max already.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.470
- 1,000.
- Yeah.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.806
- 1,200.
- Damn, 1,000 was my max.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.409
1,300, now, 1,400.
- Such a liar, Rene.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.512
1,500, now, 1,600.
- 2,000!

08:32.613 --> 08:37.918
- 2,100.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.386
2,700.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.888
- Rene's got no clue
I'm bidding.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.657
I call this strategy
silent but deadly.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.493
- 2,700, make it 2,800.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.095
2,900.

08:48.195 --> 08:53.967
And 3,000.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.570
3,100.

08:56.670 --> 09:02.209
3,200.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.678
3,300.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.047
Sold it to you, Rene, 3,200.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.382
- Somebody bid me up,
but I don't care.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.686
I still won.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.288
- All right, you guys.
Last unit of the auction.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.025
*

09:18.125 --> 09:21.094
- A lot of Coke bottles
and I see a little car stereo.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.263
That an 8
This unit's pretty vintage.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.765
I don't know if
I'm budging on this.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.067
- The Coke bottles
are kinda cool, you know?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.669
Get a couple bucks
a pop bottle,

09:28.769 --> 09:31.004
but I got a feeling
because of the pop bottles,

09:31.104 --> 09:33.573
this locker's gonna bring
a lot more than it's worth.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.975
- The furniture's kinda
mismatching.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.443
It's just like, I don't know.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.646
The only thing that really
kinda--what even makes me

09:38.746 --> 09:40.113
take a second look
at the locker

09:40.213 --> 09:41.682
is all the Coca-Cola stuff
right there.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.685
Those yellow trays there,
like, I get 30 bucks a tray.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.419
- Ah, got a old school
entertainment center,

09:46.519 --> 09:49.456
old dresser, dolls wrapped up
in plastic.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.091
Got a lot of recycling
over there.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.259
I'm looking for something
much bigger,

09:52.359 --> 09:54.027
much more exciting.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.562
- Hey, Justin, here.
I'm gonna give you

09:55.663 --> 09:57.164
a money-making opportunity.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.800
- I tell you what, you can buy
this locker and make money.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.401
I'll buy all the Coke trays
from you.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.003
Just the trays, I don't even
care about the bottle.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.537
I'll give you ten bucks a tray.
There's 11 trays in there.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.006
That's $110.
- All right, guys

10:06.106 --> 10:08.375
Here you go, guys.
A 10 by 15.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.343
- But I'm giving you $110
just for the trays.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.312
- Coke bottles,
exercise equipment!

10:12.412 --> 10:13.513
- Think about it.
- We'll see.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.615
- And 25, 30.
- I'll give you 10.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.950
- I'll give you 30.

10:17.050 --> 10:22.389
- 25, 35.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.591
- Sold!
- Ten bucks a tray, Justin.

10:24.692 --> 10:27.360
- Sold!

10:30.563 --> 10:32.465
- Come on.
- Sold it to you.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.534
$30, to Justin.
Next time you do that,

10:34.634 --> 10:36.670
you won't get another locker.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.906
- You let the auctioneer
know who's boss.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.674
- All righty, guys.
That's gonna do it for the day.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.409
- If you got a unit,
please meet me in the office.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.945
See you next time
Thanks for coming.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.814
You didn't buy anything.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.882
- Hey, I was looking
for big and funky.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.251
And it's just hard to find
that kind of stuff, so...

10:51.351 --> 10:52.619
The funk factor,

10:52.720 --> 10:54.521
it just wasn't here today.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.588
- Yeah, that's what
I'm looking for.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.724
It is what it is.

10:56.824 --> 11:01.261
- I've been there many a times.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.362
- Do you wanna
take a quick look,

11:02.462 --> 11:03.797
see if you get your money back?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.132
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- Come on, let's go.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.266
There's a couple things
I'm interested in.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.467
I saw these Disney prints
right here.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.802
I'll do five bucks
apiece on those

11:08.902 --> 11:10.403
There's ten of them.
Okay, so that's 50 bucks.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.206
And then on the trays, I'll do
50 bucks on the five trays.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.207
And what do you want
for these?

11:14.307 --> 11:15.442
- Make it worth my day.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.810
- Okay, we'll do 50 bucks
for the three.

11:16.910 --> 11:17.978
- All right, 50 bucks
for the three.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.180
- So that's 50, 50 and 50.
That's 150.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.348
- All right.
- See, you're making money.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.550
Now you're learning.
All right.

11:23.650 --> 11:24.684
This doesn't mean
we're friends.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.719
We're just doing
business together.

11:25.819 --> 11:26.820
- No, this is
strictly business.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.956
But being nice
sure didn't hurt.

11:29.056 --> 11:33.026
Oh. It's a box for a Nintendo
Entertainment System.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.127
If this thing
was in here, man,

11:34.227 --> 11:35.528
this would bring
a lot of money.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.530
So we got a radio here.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.067
Alpine. And it's in there.
$25 on this thing here.

11:40.167 --> 11:44.171
What? And I think it might
actually be in here.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.107
*

11:47.207 --> 11:49.142
Okay, we got
the robot in there.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.444
And all of its pieces to it,
the gun.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.814
So we got everything
for the game.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.548
Now we just gotta
find the system.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.450
These Nintendo parts,
they're cool and everything

11:57.550 --> 12:01.822
but without the console,
I can't do anything with it.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.691
Looks like we got
some fair prizes here.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.093
It's pretty cool.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.461
*

12:08.561 --> 12:11.698
This suits right here, 'cause
I just knocked this unit out.

12:11.799 --> 12:15.702
Put 'em at $10 apiece.
That's $30 in plushies.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.737
We're looking at about $75
on the equipment,

12:17.838 --> 12:19.807
just so I can
get rid of it quick.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.342
Come on, man.
Where are you at?

12:22.442 --> 12:26.013
Ahh, and we found the console.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.081
That's it, baby.
This thing's awesome.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.582
You know, this is
way before my time,

12:29.682 --> 12:31.218
but someone like me can respect
something like this.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.285
I definitely have to
get this checked out.

12:32.385 --> 12:37.157
I'm excited, man.
Let's go, buddy.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.860
- It's 110 degrees.
You ready to do some work?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.328
Yup.
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.630
Bargain hunters crew
does not yup.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.799
Ever. You yup,
you gonna need these.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.034
And I can get
ten bucks for that,

12:47.134 --> 12:48.735
so I prefer not to give
this to you.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.570
This unit is huge and packed.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.106
We got a lot of work to do.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.108
Box full of Lego toys.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.878
Beanie Babies. $150 box.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.779
Oh, cool. These are
the victrola records.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.048
They're a little bit
harder to find.

13:01.148 --> 13:04.017
Sell these for 40 bucks.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.552
And they're 20 bucks a bag,
every time.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.254
There's, like,
50 bags right here.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.756
At 20 bucks a bag,
that's 1,000 bucks.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.092
I got this locker in the bag.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.827
So this is super cool,
right here.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.395
'70s or '80s.
Mine is okay.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.598
I'll probably get $300.
Should be a pretty quick mover.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.300
This whole box
is full of DVDs.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.601
There's at least
100 movies in there.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.736
We get three bucks a movie,
a $300 box.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.106
Jewelry box. Uh-oh.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.408
Jewelry, jewelry.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.677
Oh, wow. Err!
Put on the brakes.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.245
This one is stamped gold 14k.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.981
Purple stone,
diamonds all around.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.448
That's a nice $200 ring.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.650
All the costume jewelry's
at least 200 bucks.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.352
A little
Incredible Shrinky Dicks.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.154
Oh, Shrinky Dinks.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.256
Dinks. Let me clarify that.
Dinks.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.791
That's ten bucks.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.293
And this is the Lil Bratz
Lil Oven.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.461
That's another ten bucks.
These are all 45s.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.730
We sell these for $1.99.
That's 100 bucks.

13:50.830 --> 13:55.168
*

13:55.268 --> 13:56.469
That sucks that door's broken.

13:56.569 --> 13:57.804
But somebody'll buy it
to fix it up.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.873
I'll get, like, 40 bucks.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.075
Bathroom stuff.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.145
Ah, clean. $40 box.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.347
That's always a good sign.
It says "Fragile: Miniatures,

14:07.447 --> 14:08.548
handle with care."

14:08.648 --> 14:10.517
What miniatures?

14:10.617 --> 14:11.885
Oh, that's great, actually.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.887
I've sold before, like,
couch and end tables

14:13.987 --> 14:15.388
for, like, $200, $300.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.957
This is cool.
This is all old.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.391
It looks like this
whole box right here

14:18.491 --> 14:22.495
is wood mini furniture,
so 150 bucks for the box.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.065
Set of vintage bistro chairs.

14:25.165 --> 14:29.136
The seats are there.
We'll get 40 bucks for the set.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.973
Brand new Barbies. $200.
Here we go.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.408
Oh, look at these.
Raggedy Anns and Raggedy Andys.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.979
I'm gonna say at least $300.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.049
Again, easy $100 box.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.416
That's $12,000 right there

14:43.516 --> 14:44.817
and we're only, like,
halfway through the unit.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.086
How many bags
do we got there?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.220
- Got another 50 bags.
- Let's just go

14:47.320 --> 14:48.555
straight across,
20 bucks a bag?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.290
All right.
- That's another $1,000.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.360
Got a nice table right here.
Get 50 bucks for the table.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.162
Here's a little wrought iron
wrapped piece.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.797
It's really beautiful.
I'll get 80 bucks.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.100
Then it looks like
these are all full of movies.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.768
We're looking at another $300.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.037
This is a really nice
wavy little dresser right here.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.973
1940s. 150 bucks.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.342
Nice little mirror right here.
40 bucks.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.711
I'll get 40 for the vintage
baby carriage.

15:11.811 --> 15:14.247
Here's a nice display case.
50 bucks.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.649
Little vintage Singer machine.
That's 60 bucks.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.952
Ten more tubs.
Let's just be conservatively,

15:19.052 --> 15:20.520
I'd say 30 bucks a tub.

15:20.620 --> 15:24.091
That's another 300. You got a
small dresser at 40 bucks.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.593
And you got a vintage dresser
right here, another 40 bucks.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.328
50 bucks on the China hutch.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.631
Over 14 grand.
If I had a mic, I'd drop it.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.666
Again, I've proven who's boss.

15:33.766 --> 15:38.438
When I come, I make money.
That's just how it goes.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.973
- Here we are, one of
the greatest guys on YouTube,

15:40.073 --> 15:41.941
The Completionist.
I'm bringing my Nintendo stuff

15:42.042 --> 15:44.911
to YouTube star, Jirard
"The Completionist" Khalil.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.580
- Each and every week,
it's man versus game.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.582
And I've been doing this
for six years.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.184
What do we got here?
- So I brought

15:51.284 --> 15:52.952
my crazy robot thing.
I don't really know

15:53.053 --> 15:54.354
too much about it,
so I'm hoping you can

15:54.454 --> 15:56.056
give me some good news.
- Let's check him out.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.291
His name is R.O.B. the robot.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.128
It stands for an acronym, which
is Robotic Operating Buddy.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.330
R.O.B.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.331
Yeah.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.832
- Looks like it works.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.435
And his entire shtick
was that he was your player 2.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.769
So you hook him up
to your console,

16:09.869 --> 16:11.004
you put a controller
in his hand

16:11.104 --> 16:12.539
and he plays alongside
with you.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.207
The biggest problem
with R.O.B. the robot

16:14.307 --> 16:15.875
is he's very slow.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.310
- Oh, okay.
- So it looks like you have

16:17.410 --> 16:20.013
everything here that came
in the NES Deluxe bundle.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.614
The next big step is obviously
to try it out

16:21.714 --> 16:22.849
and see if it works.
- All right,

16:22.949 --> 16:24.084
let's fire this bad boy up.

16:24.184 --> 16:28.788
*

16:28.888 --> 16:30.790
*

16:30.890 --> 16:34.827
- Yeah, see, they call this the
red, blinking light of doom.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.530
- Don't get discouraged.
It happens all the time.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.466
This is very common.
A lot of these NESs

16:39.566 --> 16:40.900
do not work out the gate.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.202
It's gonna take a lot of
finagling

16:42.302 --> 16:44.871
and a lot of resetting
and gently pushing

16:44.971 --> 16:46.239
to try and get it to work.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.508
You see people and just being,
like

16:48.608 --> 16:50.177
Blowing into the cartridge.
- I used to do that.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.911
- Yeah, 'cause you thought
it would fix it, right?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.513
- Yeah.
- Doesn't actually do anything.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.548
It's just a thing that everyone
picked up over the years.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.984
- Then we can try and--

16:58.085 --> 16:59.186
Ah, there we go,
there we go.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.187
- It's gonna work,
I'm telling you.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.188
- If you think so.

17:01.288 --> 17:05.525
*

17:05.625 --> 17:07.694
- Oh, it works!
- Here we go.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.562
- I'm telling you, man.
The blow thing always works.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.997
How much can I get
for this whole set?

17:11.098 --> 17:13.733
- You do have bits
and pieces of everything.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.602
The controllers
are pretty solid.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.837
R.O.B. himself
is pretty good looking.

17:17.937 --> 17:24.177
If I were to guess, $225?

17:24.277 --> 17:26.179
- That's amazing.
Time to do the robot.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.415
Ah, ah.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.451
*

17:31.551 --> 17:33.320
- Again, he's kind of

17:33.420 --> 17:36.623
a slow toy that--more of
a novelty than anything.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.624
- So you know they say robots
are gonna be

17:37.724 --> 17:39.025
taking over the world, right?

17:39.126 --> 17:42.329
- Uh, not this one.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.231
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey, Darrell.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.634
- Well, this is what I got.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.403
I'm gonna go see Bill Czappa
of Arc TV.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.939
He's gonna take a look
at my tubes and my tester.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.641
I've had my tubes
tested before.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.609
Hopefully this time,
I won't have to cough.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.878
*

17:58.978 --> 18:01.080
- An Eico. Very cool.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.850
- There's a whole box of tubes
and everything in here.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.885
- Well, usually,
tubes are used.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.887
- Is there any collector
value to them at all?

18:07.987 --> 18:09.256
- No, no.
- 'Cause, hell,

18:09.356 --> 18:11.224
we got test tube babies.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.394
These are usually tubes
that go in TV sets.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.795
But sometimes radios.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.630
This tube was usually to--

18:17.730 --> 18:19.199
worked in the color circuits.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.001
- So that tube right there
lights up the whole screen

18:22.101 --> 18:23.536
in color?
- No, no.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.172
Each tube has a function.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.774
Some are amplifier tubes,
with the sound.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.310
Some are tuner tubes
that pick up the signal.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.779
And they all do
different things.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.381
And so you have to tell
the machine

18:34.481 --> 18:35.582
what kind of tube it is.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.418
And every tube has a number.
- Got it.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.052
- This is a common, 60H8.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.055
So then you'd look down here
and you'd find it.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.824
And you follow
what it says here.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.626
All these codes will set these

18:46.726 --> 18:49.329
and you'll figure out
if the tube's good or not.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.831
- Look at that, you got it,
like, stick shift all of them.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.766
- Yeah, they made it really
easy for anybody

18:53.866 --> 18:55.268
to use if, you know--
!

18:55.368 --> 18:57.036
- Okay, so then the last thing
you do

18:57.136 --> 18:58.438
is find the socket
this went in.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.507
Where's the plug?
There it is.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.975
I'm all set up.
So all we have to do

19:03.075 --> 19:07.514
is hit this
and we see it's weak.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.682
- Isn't that a new tube
you just got out of the back?

19:09.782 --> 19:11.384
- It is, but they've been
sitting around,

19:11.484 --> 19:13.085
so sometimes they go weak.
- Oh.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.922
- Anyway. Yeah, so you got a
nice little tube checker here.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.857
- People still use
these machines or what?

19:17.957 --> 19:19.226
- We do.
We use them every week.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.660
And there's collectors
all over the country,

19:20.760 --> 19:23.363
you know, that are fixing old
radios and stuff.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.664
And you need one of these.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.166
- Bill, I've got
a professional tube tester.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.635
- Mm-hmm.
- And you say it works.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.703
What do you think
this is worth?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.905
- It's a really nice one.
It was one of

19:33.005 --> 19:34.707
the state-of-the-art ones.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.609
You got the manual.
It's very clean.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.578
And it doesn't look like
it was used that much.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.280
So I'd say...

19:40.380 --> 19:43.082
*

19:43.182 --> 19:45.285
It's probably worth
about 250 bucks.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.853
- Mm-hmm.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.321
- Not bad.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.722
Remember in the old days,
you used to have to

19:49.822 --> 19:52.759
wait for the tube to warm up?
- You still do.

19:52.859 --> 19:56.463
- Yeah.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.231
- All right.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.767
male narrator: Rene Nezhoda
rocked the competition,

20:00.867 --> 20:03.736
bagging 11,000 dineros.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.473
Darrell Sheets felt
totally tubular,

20:06.573 --> 20:09.276
cranking up $965.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.645
Justin Bryant's nice guy act
paid off nicely,

20:12.745 --> 20:15.582
netting him 475 bucks.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.150
And Ivy Calvin
couldn't find the funk

20:18.251 --> 20:20.987
and walked away
with no junk.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.956
- I think I'll do some BB gun
practice with the tubes.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.658
- That would be fun.
- Yeah.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.993
You ever heard 'em
when they pop?

20:27.093 --> 20:29.529
- Yeah. They sound great.
- Pop one.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.163
Be my guest.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.399
[clatters on the floor
without breaking]

20:32.499 --> 20:33.500
- Uh!

20:33.600 --> 20:35.368
- Take a little more.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.169
- Pop it!

20:37.270 --> 20:38.805
- You know, we drop these
things all the time.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.607
both: And they break.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.108
- And now that you're
trying to break one--

20:42.208 --> 20:43.576
- Yeah.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.615
*

20:48.715 --> 20:50.817
There you go! That was cool.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.386
- Oh!
- Mazel tov!
