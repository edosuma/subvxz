WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:06.077
ADAM WAS FINISHED
WITH KATHERINE...

00:06.077 --> 00:09.240
PLEASE GET RID OF THAT GUM.
 BUT DYLAN'S FATHER CAME BACK.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.182
BYE, SWEETHEART.
 BYE, DAD.

00:11.182 --> 00:14.085
I TRICKED YOU INTO
THINKING DYLAN WAS YOURS.

00:14.085 --> 00:17.017
I FINISHED THAT D.N.A.
YOU WANTED, AND YOUR SUSPECT'S

00:17.017 --> 00:18.649
NOT RELATED
TO THE VICTIM AT ALL.

00:18.649 --> 00:21.492
GABY AND CARLOS WERE FORCED
TO GO TO THE POLICE.

00:21.492 --> 00:26.057
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS COCAINE?
 CARLOS, I WAS A FASHION MODEL
IN THE '90s. I KNOW COCAINE.

00:26.057 --> 00:28.629
JUST GIVE ME WHAT I WANT...
 AND LYNETTE...

00:28.629 --> 00:30.731
OR YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LIKE WHAT HAPPENS.
 (grunts)

00:30.731 --> 00:33.804
(gasps)
 ...WAS PUSHED
TO HER BREAKING POINT.

00:37.168 --> 00:39.640
(Mary Alice)
COFFEE MUGS TO THE CONTRARY,

00:39.640 --> 00:41.142
LYNETTE SCAVO KNEW

00:41.142 --> 00:45.216
THAT SHE WAS NOT
THE WORLD'S GREATEST MOTHER.

00:45.216 --> 00:47.748
IN FACT,
WHEN IT CAME TO PARENTING,

00:47.748 --> 00:51.652
LYNETTE HAD DONE MANY THINGS
SHE WAS NOT PROUD OF...

00:53.053 --> 00:55.556
LIKE THE TIME
WHEN SHE OFFERED PARKER CASH

00:55.556 --> 00:58.559
IF HE AGREED
TO EAT ALL OF HIS SPINACH...

00:58.559 --> 01:00.631
OR WHEN SHE TOLD THE TWINS

01:00.631 --> 01:05.296
THERE WAS TREASURE
BURIED BENEATH THE WEEDS...

01:05.296 --> 01:08.439
OR WHEN SHE GAVE HER KIDS
A LITTLE EXTRA COUGH SYRUP

01:08.439 --> 01:12.173
SO SHE COULD FINISH HER NOVEL.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.075
BUT DESPITE THESE LAPSES...
 (bell dings)

01:15.075 --> 01:17.077
LYNETTE DIDN'T THINK OF HERSELF

01:17.077 --> 01:19.380
AS THE WORST MOTHER
IN THE WORLD EITHER,

01:19.380 --> 01:21.852
UNTIL ONE HORRIBLE DAY.

01:21.852 --> 01:24.815
SINCE WHEN
DOYOUMAKE WAFFLES?

01:24.815 --> 01:26.317
WELL, KAYLA LOVES WAFFLES,

01:26.317 --> 01:29.260
AND SINCE SHE AND I HAVE BEEN
HAVING SOME PROBLEMS LATELY,

01:29.260 --> 01:32.092
I WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR HER.
 (doorbell rings)

01:32.092 --> 01:35.095
OH, YOU TELL KAYLA
HER BREAKFAST IS READY.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.829
HI.
 MY NAME IS FERN PARRISH.

01:38.829 --> 01:41.132
THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE,
IRENE SEMANIS.
 (laughs)

01:41.132 --> 01:44.235
WE'RE FROM C.P.S.
 UH, ONE SEC.
PRESTON, YOU MIGHT WANNA

01:44.235 --> 01:46.537
STOP DROPPING YOUR WAFFLE
ON THE FLOOR,

01:46.537 --> 01:49.180
'CAUSE I'M STILL
GONNA MAKE YOU EAT IT.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.882
SO, UH, WHAT'S C.P.S.?

01:51.882 --> 01:54.185
CHILDREN'S
PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

01:54.185 --> 01:57.888
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I KEEP
MY FLOORS INCREDIBLY CLEAN.

01:57.888 --> 01:59.890
MRS. SCAVO,
WE RECENTLY RECEIVED

01:59.890 --> 02:02.853
A REPORT OF SOME ABUSE
IN YOUR HOME.

02:02.853 --> 02:05.256
ABUSE? THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

02:05.256 --> 02:07.628
WELL, WE GOT A CALL
FROM A DR. JOSHUA DOLAN?

02:07.628 --> 02:10.461
IT SEEMS HE WAS CONTACTED
BY YOUR DAUGHTER KAYLA.

02:10.461 --> 02:13.434
WHO SAYS YOU HIT HER...
REPEATEDLY.

02:13.434 --> 02:16.637
OKAY...

02:16.637 --> 02:19.139
FIRST,
I'M NOT THAT KIND OF MOM.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.711
AND SECOND,

02:20.711 --> 02:24.475
KAYLA HAS A TENDENCY
TO... EXAGGERATE.

02:24.475 --> 02:27.618
WE ALSO HAVE A SECURITY TAPE
FROM A CLOTHING STORE.

02:27.618 --> 02:31.182
IT SHOWS YOU SLAPPING
A YOUNG GIRL ACROSS THE FACE.

02:31.182 --> 02:33.884
WE'RE ASSUMING THAT'S KAYLA.

02:38.229 --> 02:41.262
HAVE A SEAT.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A SECOND.

02:43.294 --> 02:50.301
YES, LYNETTE SCAVO WAS NOT
THE WORLD'S GREATEST MOTHER.

02:50.301 --> 02:51.302
(bell dings)

02:51.302 --> 02:52.603
BUT IN HER HEART,

02:52.603 --> 02:56.277
SHE KNEW SHE HAD DONE
THE BEST SHE COULD...

02:56.277 --> 02:58.579
GIVEN...

02:58.579 --> 03:01.782
WHAT SHE HAD TO WORK WITH.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.297
"LYNETTE"--

03:16.297 --> 03:20.371
IT'S HOW THE FRENCH DESCRIBE
"A PRETTY ONE."

03:20.371 --> 03:21.872
"KATHERINE"--

03:21.872 --> 03:27.238
COINED BY THE ANCIENT GREEKS,
IT DENOTES "PURITY."

03:27.238 --> 03:28.639
"GABRIELLE"--

03:28.639 --> 03:33.384
A HEBREW WORD MEANING
"GOD IS MY STRENGTH."

03:33.384 --> 03:35.386
"BREE"--

03:35.386 --> 03:39.390
IT'S AN IRISH NAME
THAT MEANS "POWER."

03:39.390 --> 03:41.552
INDEED...

03:41.552 --> 03:45.826
EVERY NAME HAS
A SINGLE SPECIFIC MEANING...

03:47.528 --> 03:50.601
WHICH IS WHY PARENTS
HAVE TROUBLE CHOOSING ONE

03:50.601 --> 03:55.466
FOR SOMEONE
WHO MEANS EVERYTHING TO THEM.

03:55.466 --> 03:57.468
WHAT ABOUT "PHILIP"?
I LIKE "PHILIP."

03:57.468 --> 03:59.470
OH, I KNOW YOU DO.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.472
I DON'T,
AND NEITHER DOES THE BABY.

04:01.472 --> 04:03.644
PHILIP? OH, PHIL?

04:03.644 --> 04:06.317
SEE? NOTHING.
NOT EVEN A BURP.

04:06.317 --> 04:08.248
HERE'S A THOUGHT.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.251
HOW ABOUT "NATHANIEL"?
 ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S THE FOURTH TIME

04:11.251 --> 04:13.824
YOU'VE TRIED TO SNEAK
"NATHANIEL" PAST ME.

04:13.824 --> 04:17.827
I'M PUTTING "PEYTON"
BACK ON THE TABLE.
 I AM NOT NAMING MY SON
AFTER A QUARTERBACK.

04:17.827 --> 04:20.391
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S THE REST OF MY LIST.

04:20.391 --> 04:23.394
LUCAS.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE "MUCUS."

04:23.394 --> 04:25.466
MITCHUM.
 LIKE THE DEODORANT?

04:25.466 --> 04:26.767
UNITAS.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.600
OH, GIVE ME THAT.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.673
WELL,
WE NEED NEW INSPIRATION.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.306
OOH.

04:35.306 --> 04:36.477
RILEY.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.479
I LIKE IT. WHO IS HE?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.651
HE'S A GUY WHO...

04:40.651 --> 04:42.613
"KILLED SIX, THEN SELF."

04:45.055 --> 04:47.458
WELL, I GIVE UP.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.461
HE'S NOT GONNA GET A NAME.
WHEN WE WANT HIM TO COME,

04:50.461 --> 04:52.493
WE'LL JUST WHISTLE AND SAY,
"HERE, BOY."

04:52.493 --> 04:55.826
(beep)
 (woman over P.A.) DR. CONNER.
PAGING DR. CONNER.

04:55.826 --> 04:57.598
PLEASE CALL ADMITTING.
 CONNER.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.870
I LOVE IT.

04:59.870 --> 05:02.072
ME, TOO. (laughs)

05:02.072 --> 05:04.935
OH,
YOU FINALLY HAVE A NAME.

05:04.935 --> 05:07.578
DR. CONNER DELFINO.

05:09.780 --> 05:12.343
OH, HEY.
I'M GOING OUT TO THE MALL.

05:12.343 --> 05:13.844
YOU WANNA COME WITH?

05:13.844 --> 05:15.346
OH, NO, THANKS.

05:15.346 --> 05:17.848
I GOTTA MAKE SURE MY HANDYMAN
GETS HIS WIRING DONE.

05:17.848 --> 05:20.921
HE SCREWED IT UP
THE LAST TIME.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.853
YOU REALIZE
WE COULD'VE HAD A FIRE?

05:22.853 --> 05:24.324
SORRY, MRS. SOLIS.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.398
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
SEE YOU LATER.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.403
(door shuts)

05:32.403 --> 05:34.334
AND... SHE'S GONE.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.968
GREAT.
LET'S BREAK INTO HER ROOM.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.543
AS SOON I FINISH THIS,

05:42.543 --> 05:45.045
I'LL START PLACING BUGS
IN THE OTHER ROOMS.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.047
WELL,
ISN'T HER ROOM ENOUGH?

05:47.047 --> 05:50.050
SHE HAS A PREPAID CELL PHONE,
SO WE CAN'T TAP IT.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.052
OUR ONLY HOPE
AT NAILING HER SUPPLIER

05:52.052 --> 05:55.526
IS TO RECORD EVERY CONVERSATION
SHE HAS IN THIS HOUSE.

05:55.526 --> 05:58.689
WELL, HOW LONG
IS THAT GONNA TAKE?
 WE GOT A TIP THAT SHE'S
EXPECTING A DELIVERY THIS WEEK.

05:58.689 --> 06:01.692
SO IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
MISS LEONARD LEARNS THE JOYS

06:01.692 --> 06:04.635
OF A LITTLE GIRL-ON-GIRL ACTION
IN A PRISON SHOWER. (chuckles)

06:04.635 --> 06:06.637
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE A PIG.

06:06.637 --> 06:10.871
SECOND OF ALL, DON'T SAY THINGS
LIKE THAT. ELLIE'S MY FRIEND.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.373
YEAH, WELL, YOUR FRIEND IS
A DRUG DEALER, i.e., SCUM.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.876
(scoffs) HEY!
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.378
OKAY, YES,
SHE'S MADE SOME BAD CHOICES,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.380
BUT DEEP DOWN,
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.454
YEAH, WELL, DEEP DOWN,
I HOPE SHE ROTS IN JAIL.

06:23.454 --> 06:25.456
OKAY,
WHEN THIS THING IS OVER,

06:25.456 --> 06:28.459
LET'S NOT DO THE WHOLE
CHRISTMAS CARD THING.
 (door shuts)

06:28.459 --> 06:31.492
IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND?
 NO, HE'S AT BRAILLE SCHOOL.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.464
(key turning in lock)

06:36.527 --> 06:38.569
GABY?

06:38.569 --> 06:41.502
OH, ELLIE! HEY!

06:41.502 --> 06:44.004
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING IN MY ROOM?!

06:44.004 --> 06:47.007
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING YOU
BACK SO SOON.
 I FORGOT MY WALLET.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.010
AGAIN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM?

06:50.010 --> 06:53.013
WELL, WE NEEDED SOME PRIVACY.
SEE, ROY AND I ARE LOVERS.

06:54.685 --> 06:57.187
YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH YOUR HANDYMAN?

06:57.187 --> 06:59.850
I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY. YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE THE PASSION.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.553
I MEAN,
I WAS POWERLESS TO RESIST.

07:02.553 --> 07:04.455
(chuckles)

07:04.455 --> 07:06.597
JUST--
JUST GET OUT OF MY ROOM.

07:06.597 --> 07:08.859
OKAY, OKAY. WE'RE GOING.

07:10.761 --> 07:14.565
(both exhale deeply)

07:14.565 --> 07:16.707
(whispers) THAT'S FOR
USING YOUR TONGUE.

07:18.469 --> 07:20.811
LOTS OF PEOPLE
DO MISSIONARY WORK,

07:20.811 --> 07:24.575
BUT FEW HAVE THE GUTS TO SMUGGLE
BIBLES INTO NORTH KOREA.

07:24.575 --> 07:26.577
IT IS MY DISTINCT PLEASURE

07:26.577 --> 07:28.949
TO WELCOME BACK,
AFTER FOUR LONG YEARS--

07:28.949 --> 07:30.450
REVEREND MICHAEL GREEN.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.485
(applause)

07:34.485 --> 07:37.488
THANK YOU FOR THAT
GLORIOUS INTRODUCTION, JOE.

07:37.488 --> 07:40.761
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.
NOW IF YOU'LL ALL PLEASE STAND

07:40.761 --> 07:43.734
AND OFFER EACH OTHER
THE LORD'S PEACE.

07:45.636 --> 07:47.137
(congregants
speaking indistinctly)

07:47.137 --> 07:48.138
(gasps)

07:48.138 --> 07:50.470
PEACE BE WITH YOU, BREE.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.544
I REJECT YOUR PEACE, AND I
DEMAND YOU STOP STALKING ME.

07:53.544 --> 07:55.876
I'M DOING NO SUCH THING.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.549
REALLY? SO I JUST HAPPEN TO RUN
INTO YOU AT THE DRY CLEANER,

07:58.549 --> 08:01.612
THE GREENGROCER,
THE POST OFFICE?
 WE SHARED A LIFE TOGETHER.

08:01.612 --> 08:05.656
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
WE'D FREQUENT THE SAME PLACES.
 OH, PLEASE.
I SAW YOU AT MY NAIL SALON.

08:05.656 --> 08:07.788
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BIBLE
THAT SAYS A MAN

08:07.788 --> 08:11.722
CAN'T ENJOY A NICE PEDICURE.
 ORSON, HEAR ME
WHEN I SAY THIS. IT'S OVER.

08:11.722 --> 08:14.224
YOU HAVE DONE
UNCONSCIONABLE THINGS

08:14.224 --> 08:16.226
FOR WHICH
I CAN NEVER FORGIVE YOU,

08:16.226 --> 08:19.029
AND NO AMOUNT OF FLITTING ABOUT
IN MY PERIPHERAL VISION

08:19.029 --> 08:22.032
IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT.
 BUT THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING I CAN DO.

08:22.032 --> 08:24.504
YOU KNOW I'VE REPENTED.
WE--WE CAN GET PAST THIS.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.007
(whispering) I KNOW
NO SUCH THING. NOW BE QUIET.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.839
I'M DONE TALKING TO YOU.

08:28.839 --> 08:32.011
BREE, SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
PEACE BE WITH YOU.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.844
AND ALSO WITH YOU.

08:33.844 --> 08:36.547
(whispers)
DO NOT GIVE THIS MAN PEACE.

08:40.250 --> 08:45.195
YOU SHOULDN'T KEEP
YOUR DOORS UNLOCKED, KATHY.

08:45.195 --> 08:49.700
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALL 'EM
"CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY"?

08:49.700 --> 08:52.863
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:55.305 --> 08:58.569
DYLAN USED TO HAVE
A BIG OLD SCAR RIGHT HERE,

08:58.569 --> 09:00.070
AND NOW IT'S GONE.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.713
I'M JUST CURIOUS

09:02.713 --> 09:05.746
HOW YOU WOULD EXPLAIN THAT.

09:05.746 --> 09:09.720
NEVER TOO EARLY
TO START DRINKING, IS IT?

09:09.720 --> 09:12.552
SHE FELL OFF HER BIKE.
11 STITCHES. I REMEMBER.

09:15.886 --> 09:19.730
I TOOK HER TO A PLASTIC SURGEON
IN CHICAGO

09:19.730 --> 09:21.862
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.864
WELL,
THAT'S PRETTY CONVENIENT.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.997
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING,
WAYNE?

09:26.997 --> 09:28.739
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

09:28.739 --> 09:31.742
I FELT IT FROM THE MOMENT
THAT I LAID EYES ON HER.

09:31.742 --> 09:35.676
I JUST DON'T SEE MYSELF
IN HER AT ALL.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.678
I TOLD YOU.
SHE'S NOT YOURS.

09:37.678 --> 09:41.281
YEAH, BUT I DON'T SEEYOU
 IN HER EITHER.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.014
SO...

09:44.014 --> 09:46.787
LET'S JUST SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

09:46.787 --> 09:51.191
TAKE A D.N.A. TEST. ALL I NEED
IS ONE STRAND OF HAIR.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.624
KNOCK, KNOCK.
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

09:53.624 --> 09:57.297
NO, NOT AT ALL.
 (Lee) GREAT, BECAUSE WE ARE HERE

09:57.297 --> 10:00.000
TO THROW OURSELVES
ON YOUR MERCY.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.002
WE ARE HAVING A COMMITMENT
CEREMONY IN FIVE DAYS,

10:02.002 --> 10:04.374
AND OUR CATERER JUST CANCELED.
 WE KNOW IT'S SHORT NOTICE.

10:04.374 --> 10:08.178
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
IF YOU SAY NO.
 NONSENSE. I'D LOVE TO DO IT.

10:08.178 --> 10:11.041
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT,
AND WE'LL TALK DETAILS?

10:11.041 --> 10:15.385
I'M SORRY. IF... YOU'RE BUSY,
WE CAN COME BACK LATER.

10:15.385 --> 10:18.749
NO, NO. NO, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU STAY.

10:18.749 --> 10:20.991
I'LLCOME BACK LATER.

10:24.655 --> 10:26.156
LYNETTE, I'M SORRY.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.659
WHEN I'M TOLD ABOUT
A SUSPECTED CASE OF CHILD ABUSE,

10:28.659 --> 10:30.661
I AM BOUND BY LAW
TO REPORT IT.

10:30.661 --> 10:32.663
OKAY, SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

10:32.663 --> 10:35.706
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP C.P.S.
FINISH THEIR INVESTIGATION.

10:35.706 --> 10:38.709
THEY'LL INTERVIEW YOUR KIDS,
THEIR TEACHERS,

10:38.709 --> 10:40.711
POSSIBLY
SOME OF YOUR NEIGHBORS.

10:40.711 --> 10:44.244
MY NEIGHBORS? GOD!
I COULD STRANGLE THAT GIRL.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.747
HONEY, YOU MIGHT WANNA STOP
SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT.

10:46.747 --> 10:50.420
LOOK, FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS,
LET TOM HANDLE THE KIDS.

10:50.420 --> 10:52.923
ANY OTHER PROBLEMS
BETWEEN YOU AND KAYLA

10:52.923 --> 10:55.726
COULD JEOPARDIZE CUSTODY
OF ALL YOUR CHILDREN.

10:55.726 --> 10:58.759
WAIT. THEY COULD TAKE
MY CHILDREN?

10:58.759 --> 11:01.792
NO ONE'S TAKING ANYONE.
 YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME!

11:01.792 --> 11:04.334
THIS IS ALL
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

11:04.334 --> 11:07.798
I'M SURE
THAT WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.
 SO WHAT DO I NEED TO DO
TO KEEP MY KIDS?

11:07.798 --> 11:10.801
(Dr. Dolan) WELL, THERE ARE
A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO.

11:10.801 --> 11:12.803
FIRST,
NO PHYSICAL DISCIPLINE...

11:36.126 --> 11:37.828
BOB LIKED THE IDEA

11:37.828 --> 11:40.470
OF THE ONION
AND WHITE ASPARAGUS TART.

11:40.470 --> 11:43.203
WONDERFUL!
WITH A LITTLE GOAT CHEESE.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.176
OH, AND LEE ASKED
FOR STUFFED MUSHROOMS.
 (presses button, beep)

11:46.176 --> 11:49.709
THOSE WITH ROASTED GREEN BEANS
AS OUR SIDE DISHES.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.711
(whirs)

11:51.711 --> 11:54.344
NICE TIGHT GROUPING.
YOU ARE NOT RUSTY AT ALL.

11:54.344 --> 11:56.987
THANK YOU. FELT GOOD.

11:56.987 --> 11:59.820
ALTHOUGH I ALWAYS, UH,
LIKE A TRIP TO THE RANGE,

11:59.820 --> 12:02.823
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON
WE CAME HERE FOR PARTY PLANNING?

12:02.823 --> 12:04.154
WELL, WITH ADAM GONE,

12:04.154 --> 12:06.927
I'VE JUST BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE... UNEASY LATELY.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.229
IT'S FUNNY HOW
HAVING A MAN IN THE HOUSE

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
CAN MAKE YOU FEEL SAFER,

12:11.231 --> 12:14.234
NO MATTER HOW RETIRING
OR EASILY SPOOKED HE MIGHT BE.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.237
THAT'S TRUE. I JUST NEED TO FEEL
THAT IF AN INTRUDER BROKE IN,

12:17.237 --> 12:20.771
I COULD TAKE CARE OF IT...
EFFECTIVELY.

12:20.771 --> 12:23.113
YOU REALLY WANT
TO BE EFFECTIVE?

12:23.113 --> 12:24.915
TRY HOLLOW POINTS.

12:24.915 --> 12:27.417
THESE ROUNDS YOU'VE GOT
PUNCH STRAIGHT THOUGH,

12:27.417 --> 12:29.850
BUT A HOLLOW POINT
BLOOMS ON IMPACT,

12:29.850 --> 12:32.422
CUTS THE BODY TO SHREDS
FROM THE INSIDE.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.758
SOUNDS EXACTLY
LIKE WHAT I NEED.

12:41.431 --> 12:42.933
NOW...
 (cocks gun)

12:42.933 --> 12:45.936
LET'S TALK DESSERTS.

12:45.936 --> 12:48.939
(cooing)

12:50.941 --> 12:53.243
(sighs) I JUST GOT
A CALL FROM MY MOM.

12:53.243 --> 12:54.875
MY GRANDPA DIED.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.978
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.280
I KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU LOVED HIM.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.782
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.784
I KNOW
WE SETTLED ON "CONNER,"

13:04.784 --> 13:08.919
BUT I'D, UH, I'D LIKE TO NAME
OUR SON AFTER MY GRANDFATHER.

13:08.919 --> 13:10.891
OH.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.523
WELL, YEAH, UM,

13:13.523 --> 13:16.526
I MEAN, "CONNER" IS JUST A NAME
WE PICKED OUT OF THIN AIR.

13:16.526 --> 13:20.100
THIS WOULD MEAN SOMETHING.
 SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?

13:20.100 --> 13:23.103
I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WAY
TO HONOR YOUR GRANDFATHER.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.105
I MEAN, "JAMES" WOULDN'T
BE MY FIRST CHOICE,

13:25.105 --> 13:27.908
BUT IT'S A GOOD, SOLID NAME.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.910
NO, GRANDPA JAMES IS
MY DAD'S DAD.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.281
THIS IS MY MOM'S--MAYNARD.

13:31.281 --> 13:35.886
OH, RIGHT. MAYNARD.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.950
OH, THAT'S AWFUL...

13:39.950 --> 13:42.252
THAT HE DIED.
 WHY DIDN'T WE THINK
OF THIS BEFORE?

13:42.252 --> 13:44.394
IT'S SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL SOUTHERN NAME.

13:44.394 --> 13:46.927
OH, AND RARE,

13:46.927 --> 13:48.828
REALLY RARE.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.501
AND YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S A GREAT
WAY TO HONOR MY GRANDFATHER.

13:51.501 --> 13:53.303
YEAH.

13:53.303 --> 13:56.006
I SAID THAT, DIDN'T I?

13:56.006 --> 13:58.008
OH, SHOOT. WE CAN'T DO IT.

13:58.008 --> 13:59.309
ISN'T YOUR GRANDPA JAMES

13:59.309 --> 14:01.311
SIGNIFICANTLY OLDER
THAN GRANDPA MAYNARD?

14:01.311 --> 14:03.143
SHOULDN'T WE HONOR HIM
FIRST?

14:03.143 --> 14:06.016
BUT GRANDPA JAMES
ISN'T DEAD.

14:06.016 --> 14:08.318
YOU SURE?
IT'S WORTH A PHONE CALL.

14:08.318 --> 14:11.021
ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT A COUSIN
WHO'S NAMED AFTER HIM ALREADY,

14:11.021 --> 14:13.023
SO WE'RE COVERED.
 (baby fusses)

14:13.023 --> 14:16.556
THANK YOU, SUSAN.
THIS REALLY MEANS A LOT.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.889
I'M GONNA GO CALL MY MOM.

14:18.889 --> 14:20.230
(door opens)

14:20.230 --> 14:21.962
OH.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.593
FORGIVE ME.

14:23.593 --> 14:28.999
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.
HIS GRANDFATHER JUST DIED.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.373
HEY! LUNCH IS ALMOST READY.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.046
(singsong voice)
I'M MAKING YOUR FAVORITE.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.881
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE STILL MAD AT ME.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.185
WELL, YEAH. I JUST DON'T GET
WHY YOU BROKE INTO MY ROOM.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.958
WELL, I COULDN'T RISK
DOING IT INMYROOM.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.960
EVER SINCE CARLOS WENT BLIND,

14:49.960 --> 14:51.962
HE'S DEVELOPED
A STRONG SENSE OF SMELL.

14:51.962 --> 14:54.965
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAPPENED
TO CATCH A WHIFF OF ROY,

14:54.965 --> 14:56.366
BUT THAT IS
ONE TELLTALE ODOR.

14:56.366 --> 14:58.368
WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER THING,
YOU KNOW?

14:58.368 --> 15:01.031
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THAT GUY?

15:01.031 --> 15:04.534
UH, YOU KNOW,
HE'S A HANDYMAN.

15:04.534 --> 15:06.436
HE KNOWS HOW TO...

15:06.436 --> 15:09.539
GET IN THERE...
AND MAKE STUFF WORK.

15:09.539 --> 15:11.081
BUT HE'S A ZERO,

15:11.081 --> 15:13.143
AND CARLOS IS SO FANTASTIC.

15:13.143 --> 15:15.485
DON'T YOU LOVE HIM?

15:15.485 --> 15:16.987
OF COURSE I DO.

15:16.987 --> 15:19.619
CARLOS SOLIS
IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

15:21.151 --> 15:24.324
BUT, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES YOU GET BORED,

15:24.324 --> 15:28.358
AND A BIG, GREASY,
DISGUSTING HANDYMAN

15:28.358 --> 15:30.460
REALLY HITS THE SPOT.

15:43.473 --> 15:46.076
(gasps)

15:46.076 --> 15:49.019
(sighs) ADAM, WHAT THE--
YOU SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH.

15:49.019 --> 15:52.552
SORRY. I LET MYSELF IN.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.324
WHY?

15:54.324 --> 15:56.326
DYLAN TOLD ME WAYNE'S BACK.

15:56.326 --> 15:59.029
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?
 BECAUSE I'M HANDLING IT.

15:59.029 --> 16:01.331
YEAH, SHE TOLD ME ABOUT
THE SHOOTING RANGE, TOO.

16:01.331 --> 16:04.034
YOU SURE THAT'S
THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT?

16:04.034 --> 16:06.966
ADAM, YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT YOU WERE DONE WITH ME.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.968
BUT I'M NOT DONE WITH DYLAN,

16:08.968 --> 16:11.471
AND IF WAYNE'S BACK,
THEN I'M GONNA PROTECT HER.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.145
SO MAYBE I SHOULD PAY HIM
A LITTLE VISIT, SCARE HIM OFF.

16:15.145 --> 16:18.748
IF YOU'D EVER MET WAYNE,
YOU'D KNOW BETTER.

16:18.748 --> 16:21.751
WELL, THEN
LET'S GET DYLAN OUT OF TOWN.

16:21.751 --> 16:24.254
I TRIED.
SHE SAID SHE'S NOT LEAVING.

16:26.556 --> 16:28.318
WELL, I...

16:28.318 --> 16:30.320
I PROMISED HER
A TRIP FOR GRADUATION,

16:30.320 --> 16:33.323
JUST THE THREE OF US,
ANYWHERE SHE WANTED TO GO.

16:33.323 --> 16:35.365
OKAY.

16:35.365 --> 16:38.068
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE TRIP'S OVER?

16:38.068 --> 16:40.370
WON'T WE JUST BE
AT SQUARE ONE AGAIN?

16:40.370 --> 16:43.233
NOT IF WE DON'T COME BACK.

16:45.475 --> 16:48.508
OH, SUSAN. HE'S ADORABLE.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.781
(laughs) HE'S SO PRECIOUS.
 SO IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS NOW.

16:51.781 --> 16:55.045
DID YOU AND MIKE
FINALLY LAND ON A NAME?

16:55.045 --> 16:56.386
MAYNARD.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.125
MAYNARD?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.097
WOW. INTERESTING.

17:07.097 --> 17:09.098
IT HAS
A VERY DISTINCT RING.

17:09.098 --> 17:11.101
OKAY, DROP THE ACT, LADIES.
I HATE IT, TOO.

17:11.101 --> 17:15.105
MIKE INSISTED THAT WE NAME HIM
AFTER HIS DEAD GRANDFATHER.
 HOW DID HE DIE?

17:15.105 --> 17:17.737
WAS HE BEATEN TO DEATH
'CAUSE HIS NAME WAS MAYNARD?

17:17.737 --> 17:21.540
I KNOW. IT'S TERRIBLE,
BUT I CAN'T CHANGE IT NOW.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.544
MIKE WAS
SO EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT.
 WELL, THEN APPEAL
TO HIS SENSE OF REASON,

17:24.544 --> 17:26.045
BECAUSE THE NAME "MAYNARD"

17:26.045 --> 17:28.047
DOESN'T GO
WITH THE NAME OF "DELFINO."

17:28.047 --> 17:30.520
ONE IS GERMAN
AND THE OTHER IS ITALIAN,

17:30.520 --> 17:34.124
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THOSE FOLKS GET TOGETHER.
 WELL, I'M NOT SURE
THAT THE WORLD WAR II ARGUMENT

17:34.124 --> 17:37.127
IS GONNA FLY.
 COME ON.
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

17:37.127 --> 17:40.230
I MEAN, THAT NAME
IS PRACTICALLY ABUSIVE.
 YEAH, THINK ABOUT YOUR SON.

17:40.230 --> 17:42.232
PEOPLE LIVE UP
TO THE NAMES THEY'RE GIVEN.

17:42.232 --> 17:44.794
IF MY PARENTS
HADN'T NAMED ME "GABRIELLE,"

17:44.794 --> 17:48.298
WHO KNOWS
IF I'D BE THIS PRETTY?
 I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T
NAME YOU "EINSTEIN."

17:48.298 --> 17:51.301
SO SARCASTIC, BUT WHAT WOULD
YOU EXPECT FROM A "LYNETTE"?
 (scoffs)

17:51.301 --> 17:53.072
WHAT? IF YOUR NAME
WAS "FRANCESCA,"

17:53.072 --> 17:55.105
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TIME
FOR SARCASM.

17:55.105 --> 17:59.109
YOU'D BE TOO BUSY
HAVING SEX ON A VESPA.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
MY SON'S FUTURE IS AT STAKE.

17:59.109 --> 18:03.113
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
 MAYBE NOT. WE CALL GABRIELLE
"GABY." I MEAN, PERHAPS

18:03.113 --> 18:06.156
THERE'S A SHORTENED VERSION OF
"MAYNARD" YOU COULD LIVE WITH.

18:06.156 --> 18:08.658
YEAH. WHICH SAYS
"KICK MY ASS" LESS--

18:08.658 --> 18:10.490
"MAY" OR "NERD"?

18:12.722 --> 18:16.266
(police radio chatter)

18:16.266 --> 18:18.228
(engine turns off)

18:18.228 --> 18:20.730
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:20.730 --> 18:24.204
LYNETTE SCAVO,
I'M PLACING YOU UNDER ARREST.
 WHAT? WHY? WH--FOR WHAT?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.576
KAYLA SHOWED US
THE BURN MARK ON HER ARM.

18:26.576 --> 18:29.579
BURN MARK? WHAT BURN MARK?
 YOU SEE? SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

18:29.579 --> 18:32.582
OKAY, SIR. THAT'S ENOUGH.
 NOW PLEASE, IF WE COULD JUST
GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT THIS...

18:32.582 --> 18:35.114
SIR, ENOUGH! MA'AM, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO COME WITH US.
 OH! TOM.

18:35.114 --> 18:39.349
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO CALL THE ATTORNEY.
 I--OKAY. LOOK, LOOK,
I-I WILL COME WITH YOU.

18:39.349 --> 18:42.552
PLEASE, JUST DON'T HANDCUFF ME
IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN.
 WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT

18:42.552 --> 18:45.625
BEFOREYOU HURT ONE OF THEM.
LYNETTE SCAVO, YOU HAVE

18:45.625 --> 18:48.528
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
IF YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT,

18:48.528 --> 18:51.801
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

18:51.801 --> 18:53.533
IN A COURT OF LAW.
YOU HAVE

18:53.533 --> 18:56.466
THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY
PRESENT DURING QUESTIONING.

18:56.466 --> 19:00.210
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE,
WE WILL APPOINT ONE FOR YOU.

19:07.277 --> 19:10.280
WELL, I'D--I'D BE DELIGHTED
TO SPEAK TO THEM, BREE.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.282
PERHAPS I CAN TELL 'EM
THE STORY

19:12.282 --> 19:15.555
ABOUT THE TIME I EVADED
THE NORTH KOREAN BORDER PATROL

19:15.555 --> 19:18.388
BY HIDING
IN A PILE OF OXEN DUNG.

19:18.388 --> 19:20.159
(chuckles)
THEY'LL LOVE THAT.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.233
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE BEST SENIORS' BRUNCH EVER.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.335
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

19:25.335 --> 19:27.637
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
REVEREND SYKES TENDED

19:27.637 --> 19:31.170
TO PANDER TO THE CONGREGATION'S
PROGRESSIVE ELEMENT.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.744
I PREFER YOUR MORE MUSCULAR
BRAND OF CHRISTIANITY.

19:34.744 --> 19:37.347
WELL, THANK YOU, BREE.
 HMM.

19:37.347 --> 19:39.349
I THOUGHT OF YOU ALSO.

19:39.349 --> 19:42.252
I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT REX'S PASSING,

19:42.252 --> 19:45.385
BUT I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU REMARRIED.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.958
I DID, BUT, UM, I'M AFRAID
IT HASN'T WORKED OUT.

19:48.958 --> 19:50.490
IT'S BEEN ROUGH.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.762
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

19:52.762 --> 19:55.265
WHEN CAROLYN LEFT ME,

19:55.265 --> 19:57.527
THE LONELINESS
WAS CRIPPLING.

19:57.527 --> 20:00.230
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE LEFT YOU.

20:00.230 --> 20:02.832
YES, FOR OUR KOREAN GROCER.

20:02.832 --> 20:04.374
I'LL TELL YOU,

20:04.374 --> 20:06.936
SOMETIMES
THIS MERCIFUL GOD OF OURS

20:06.936 --> 20:10.440
HAS ONE SICK SENSE OF HUMOR.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.782
CARTMAN, TABLE FOR 4, 7:30.

20:12.782 --> 20:16.386
SEE YOU THEN.
TABLE FOR ONE?
 (Orson) YES.

20:16.386 --> 20:18.318
(telephone rings)
 SCAVO'S.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.619
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

20:19.619 --> 20:21.621
OH, THIS IS A BIT AWKWARD,

20:21.621 --> 20:24.324
BUT MY SOON-TO-BE EX
JUST WALKED IN.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.357
HE'S BEEN FOLLOWING ME
EVERYWHERE.
 FOR ACE, 8:30 P.M. ALL RIGHT.

20:27.357 --> 20:29.899
WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY
IF I TOOK YOUR HAND?

20:29.899 --> 20:33.903
MAYBE THAT WAY, HE'LL FINALLY
GET THE IDEA THAT I'VE MOVED ON.

20:33.903 --> 20:37.307
MY HAND IS AT YOUR SERVICE.

20:37.307 --> 20:40.340
(woman)
RIGHT THIS WAY, SIR.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.642
WILL YOU BE NEEDING
A WINE LIST?

20:44.414 --> 20:46.616
UH...

20:46.616 --> 20:48.378
ACTUALLY, I...

20:48.378 --> 20:50.880
THINK I'LL BE NEEDING
A NEW RESTAURANT.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.425
AH, IT WORKED.

20:55.425 --> 20:56.926
(door shuts)

20:56.926 --> 20:58.788
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

20:58.788 --> 21:02.392
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

21:02.392 --> 21:05.395
THE BAIL BONDSMAN SAID
HE HAS TO RUN A CREDIT CHECK,

21:05.395 --> 21:08.568
THEN HE'LL WIRE THE MONEY.
SO AFTER YOU'VE BEEN PROCESSED,

21:08.568 --> 21:10.570
YOU CAN LEAVE.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.271
AND GO WHERE?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.804
I CAN'T GET WITHIN500 FEET
 OF MY CHILDREN.

21:14.804 --> 21:18.548
ARE YOU NOT UP TO SPEED ON
 THE PEOPLE vs. LYNETTE SCAVO?

21:18.548 --> 21:20.049
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

21:20.049 --> 21:22.482
MRS. SCAVO,
IT'S TIME TO GO.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.554
NO,YOU'LLFIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

21:24.554 --> 21:26.556
I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO MY CELL.

21:26.556 --> 21:30.360
HONEY, I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.
LOOK IT, JUST HANG IN THERE.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.463
IT'S ONLY GONNA BE
A COUPLE MORE HOURS AT THE MOST.

21:35.965 --> 21:37.967
HOW CAN YOU TALK LIKE THAT?

21:37.967 --> 21:41.401
WHAT ELSE HAS TO HAPPEN FOR YOU
TOGETWHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

21:41.401 --> 21:42.732
IDO GET IT.

21:42.732 --> 21:45.735
BUT KAYLA'S MY DAUGHTER,
SO I'M TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS

21:45.735 --> 21:47.737
IN A WAY
THAT PROTECTS OUR FAMILY.

21:47.737 --> 21:50.440
NO,YOUARE TRYING
TO STAY ON THE FENCE

21:50.440 --> 21:52.742
WHILE I FIGHT TO STOP KAYLA
FROM DESTROYING US.

21:52.742 --> 21:56.085
BUT LOOK AROUND YOU, TOM.
LOOK WHERE I AM!

21:56.085 --> 21:59.789
YOU HAVE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING NOW.

21:59.789 --> 22:02.522
FIX THIS.

22:07.657 --> 22:09.929
(door creaks)

22:11.761 --> 22:13.763
(engine turns off)

22:13.763 --> 22:16.536
(chuckles) WELL, THANK YOU
FOR A LOVELY EVENING, BREE.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.769
OH.
 YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE

22:19.769 --> 22:22.372
TO LOOK AT YOU AS JUST
ANOTHER PARISHIONER ANYMORE.

22:22.372 --> 22:25.014
NOW, NOW.
WE MUSTN'T PLAY FAVORITES,

22:25.014 --> 22:27.377
ALTHOUGH I WILL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

22:27.377 --> 22:30.820
WELL, TAKE THIS
AS A COMPLIMENT AS WELL.

22:30.820 --> 22:32.522
YOUR EYES GLIMMER

22:32.522 --> 22:35.655
LIKE THE YALU RIVER
ON A MOONLIT NIGHT.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.127
OH.

22:38.127 --> 22:40.790
HOW, UM, COLORFULLY PUT.

22:40.790 --> 22:44.434
(speaks Asian language)
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:44.434 --> 22:46.896
I WANT YOU.

22:46.896 --> 22:49.399
REVEREND GREEN!

22:49.399 --> 22:51.601
WHEN YOU TOOK MY HAND
IN THAT RESTAURANT,

22:51.601 --> 22:54.604
I COULD FEEL THE ELECTRICITY,
AND I KNOW YOU FELT IT, TOO.
 NO, I TOLD YOU.

22:54.604 --> 22:57.407
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO SEND A MESSAGE TO MY EX.

22:57.407 --> 22:59.409
OH, PLEASE. THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
SEXUAL TENSION BETWEEN US,

22:59.409 --> 23:01.411
EVER SINCE PALM SUNDAY 1996,

23:01.411 --> 23:04.414
WHEN WE BOTH REACHED
FOR THE SAME FROND.

23:04.414 --> 23:05.885
NO!

23:05.885 --> 23:07.887
BREE, IF I TOOK NO
FOR AN ANSWER,

23:07.887 --> 23:11.661
KANGWON PROVINCE WOULD
STILL HAVE 242 UNSAVED SOULS.

23:11.661 --> 23:14.123
OHH!

23:14.123 --> 23:15.625
MM.
 (grunts)

23:15.625 --> 23:17.166
OH! AAH! OH.

23:17.166 --> 23:19.769
WELL, NOW YOU'RE
SENDING OUT MIXED SIGNALS.

23:19.769 --> 23:22.472
THEN LET ME SEND YOU
A CLEAR ONE.

23:22.472 --> 23:24.504
I AM NOT ATTRACTED TO YOU.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.136
OH. OH, NICE.
FIRST, YOU USE ME,

23:27.136 --> 23:29.408
THEN YOU REJECT ME,
AND NOW YOU'RE INSULTING ME?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.911
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO NOW,
 MRS. HODGE.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.413
OH, REVEREND GREEN,
PLEASE DON'T BE UPSET.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.916
(shouting in Asian language)

23:36.916 --> 23:38.918
AAH!

23:41.651 --> 23:43.152
(milk trickling to floor)

23:43.152 --> 23:44.924
(sighs deeply) SHOOT!

23:44.924 --> 23:47.527
ELLIE,
CAN YOU HELP ME FOR A SEC?

23:49.529 --> 23:51.601
SURE. WHAT'S... OH.

23:51.601 --> 23:54.564
I SPILLED MY MILKAGAIN.

23:54.564 --> 23:56.506
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.671
GOD, I'M SO SICK
OF KNOCKING CRAP OVER.

24:01.671 --> 24:05.545
I DON'T KNOW HOW GABY PUTS UP
WITH ME. SHE'S A SAINT.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.176
YEAH, WELL...

24:08.948 --> 24:10.520
"WELL," WHAT?

24:12.451 --> 24:15.024
(sighs)

24:15.024 --> 24:18.027
(door opens and shuts,
wind chimes tinkling)

24:18.027 --> 24:19.529
HEY, SWEETIE.

24:19.529 --> 24:21.130
HEY, WHORE!

24:21.130 --> 24:23.793
EXCUSE ME?

24:23.793 --> 24:26.636
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR
WITH THE HANDYMAN.

24:26.636 --> 24:28.467
ELLIE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.240
(scoffs) THAT LITTLE SNITCH.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.043
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE DID THAT!

24:34.043 --> 24:36.576
WELL,
THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.211
UH, HELLO?

24:42.211 --> 24:44.714
ARE WE EVEN GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS?

24:44.714 --> 24:46.716
YEAH, THE SECOND
THAT BITCH GETS HOME,

24:46.716 --> 24:48.718
I'M GONNA LET HER HAVE IT.

24:48.718 --> 24:51.220
BOY, YOU TRUST SOMEONE,
AND THEY JUST BETRAY YOU.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.722
IT SUCKS, YOU KNOW?

24:52.722 --> 24:55.665
YEAH, I KNOW! GABY,
YOU CHEATED AND YOU GOT CAUGHT.

24:55.665 --> 24:57.667
NOW WILL YOU PLEASE
HAND ME A PLATE

24:57.667 --> 25:00.870
SO I CAN SMASH IT
AGAINST THE WALL?
 OH, YOU MORON!
THERE WAS NO AFFAIR!

25:00.870 --> 25:03.803
THAT WAS THE COP. ELLIE CAUGHT
US PUTTING THE BUG IN HER ROOM.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.205
THAT WAS JUST AN EXCUSE
WE USED AS A COVER.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.237
AND YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVETHAT?

25:08.237 --> 25:10.580
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, CARLOS.
YOU'RE BLIND.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.582
YOU DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE ANYMORE.

25:12.582 --> 25:14.584
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
WHAT I TELL YOU.

25:14.584 --> 25:17.086
JUST LIKE WHEN I HAND YOU
THE DEODORANT,

25:17.086 --> 25:20.019
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
IT'S NOT OVEN CLEANER.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.992
I KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR. I KNOW
IT GIVES ME ABSOLUTE POWER,

25:22.992 --> 25:25.625
BUT TOUGH. YOU'RE SCREWED.
DEAL WITH IT!

25:25.625 --> 25:27.026
ARE WE GOOD?

25:28.798 --> 25:30.860
OKAY.

25:30.860 --> 25:33.663
THANK YOU. NOW PLEASE,
I JUST LOST A FRIEND.

25:33.663 --> 25:36.105
STOP BEING SO INSENSITIVE.

25:43.713 --> 25:47.577
(murmuring)

25:47.577 --> 25:50.049
(Orson sighs) PASTOR JOE.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.052
I NOTICED THAT
THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS.
 OH, YES.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.625
REVEREND GREEN DECIDED TO CHANGE
TODAY'S SCRIPTURE READING.

25:55.625 --> 25:59.128
IT'S GOING TO BE
 COLOSSIANS3:5.

25:59.128 --> 26:02.291
OH, HE WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT SEXUAL PROMISCUITY?

26:02.291 --> 26:04.994
WELL,
IT WAS A LAST MINUTE THING.

26:04.994 --> 26:06.996
HE CAME IN THIS MORNING
MUTTERING ABOUT

26:06.996 --> 26:09.599
SOME "REDHEADED HARLOT"
IN OUR MIDST

26:09.599 --> 26:11.741
WHO NEEDS TO BE UNMASKED.

26:11.741 --> 26:14.303
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS JUST SO
RELIEVED HE WAS OFF THE KOREANS,

26:14.303 --> 26:17.176
I DIDN'T ASK QUESTIONS.
 EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

26:24.754 --> 26:27.056
(clears throat)

26:27.056 --> 26:29.358
OH. HELLO.

26:29.358 --> 26:32.321
SORRY.
I KNOW THIS IS A BAD TIME.

26:32.321 --> 26:34.363
AREN'T YOU
BREE HODGE'S EX-HUSBAND?

26:34.363 --> 26:36.365
NO, I'M HER CURRENT HUSBAND,

26:36.365 --> 26:40.069
AND I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT TODAY'S SERMON.

26:40.069 --> 26:42.672
(whispers) THEY'RE A LITTLE LATE
GETTING STARTED.

26:42.672 --> 26:44.834
I KNOW, AND REVEREND GREEN

26:44.834 --> 26:48.778
IS USUALLY SUCH A STICKLER
FOR PUNCTUALITY.

26:48.778 --> 26:51.380
WELL,
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

26:51.380 --> 26:54.383
BUT I DON'T THINK MY SERMON
IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

26:54.383 --> 26:57.647
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

26:57.647 --> 26:59.649
IF YOU SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT BREE,

26:59.649 --> 27:02.752
YOU AND I ARE
GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM.

27:02.752 --> 27:05.054
WELL,
I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY,

27:05.054 --> 27:07.757
BUT I THINK
IT'S MY DUTY AS PASTOR

27:07.757 --> 27:11.661
TO WARN MY FLOCK
WHEN A TEMPTRESS SITS AMONG US.

27:11.661 --> 27:13.362
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

27:13.362 --> 27:15.404
(grunts)

27:15.404 --> 27:17.406
(microphone feedback whines)
 (Reverend Green) WHAT
THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

27:17.406 --> 27:20.409
(Orson) I'M NOT GOING
TO LET YOU GO OUT THERE

27:20.409 --> 27:24.643
AND TRASH
THAT GOOD WOMAN'S NAME.
 "GOOD WOMAN"? SHE LED ME ON.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.716
(lowered voice)
WHO ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

27:26.716 --> 27:28.948
(Reverend Green)
SHE'S A FLAME-HAIRED JEZEBEL!

27:28.948 --> 27:33.282
(Orson) YOU'RE INSANE! SHE IS
THE MOST MORAL PERSON I KNOW!

27:33.282 --> 27:37.086
(whispers) I HAVE NO IDEA.
NOW IF YOU'LL PLEASE EXCUSE ME.
 (Reverend Green) WOULD
A MORAL PERSON LEAD A MAN ON

27:37.086 --> 27:40.129
AND THEN HUMILIATE HIM?
 I DON'T CARE
WHAT SHE DID TO YOU.

27:40.129 --> 27:42.131
I AM NOT GOING
TO LET YOU PUBLICLY DECLARE

27:42.131 --> 27:45.164
THAT BREE HODGE IS A SLUT!
 (gasps) OH, DEAR LORD.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.737
(feedback whines, thud)

27:47.737 --> 27:48.968
(sighs)

27:48.968 --> 27:51.040
(gasps)

27:53.803 --> 27:55.104
THEN AGAIN,

27:55.104 --> 27:58.377
I SUPPOSE ICOULD
 PREACH ABOUT TOLERANCE TODAY.

27:59.909 --> 28:02.451
(whispers) ORSON.

28:02.451 --> 28:04.353
(normal voice) ORSON.

28:06.255 --> 28:08.457
HELLO, MAYNARD.

28:08.457 --> 28:11.160
I LOVE YOU, MAYNARD.

28:11.160 --> 28:14.824
MY SWEET LITTLE... MAY MAY.

28:14.824 --> 28:17.366
MAMIE.

28:17.366 --> 28:18.828
NERD.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.836
(sighs)

28:34.143 --> 28:38.317
HELLO. I NEED TO CHANGE THE NAME
ON MY BABY'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.420
OKAY, LAST NAME?
 DELFINO, MAYNARD.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.253
WHERE'S THE FATHER?
YOU BOTH NEED TO SIGN THIS.

28:44.253 --> 28:47.256
OH. WORKING.
BUSY, BUSY, BUSY.

28:47.256 --> 28:50.399
UH, BUT HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU
THAT HE'S TOTALLY COOL WITH IT.

28:50.399 --> 28:52.501
WELL,
I'M BUSY, BUSY, BUSY, TOO.

28:52.501 --> 28:55.004
SO WHEN HE'S AVAILABLE,
YOU CAN COME ON BACK,

28:55.004 --> 28:57.006
AND WE'LL MAKE THE CHANGE.

28:57.006 --> 28:58.868
OH.

28:58.868 --> 29:00.870
UH...

29:00.870 --> 29:02.271
OKAY.

29:02.271 --> 29:04.874
I'M JUST GONNA LEVEL
WITH YOU.

29:04.874 --> 29:07.917
MY HUSBAND PICKED THE NAME,
AND I THINK IT'S HORRIBLE,

29:07.917 --> 29:10.419
AND I KNOW OVER TIME,
HE'S GONNA AGREE.

29:10.419 --> 29:12.321
I DON'T CARE.
RULES ARE RULES.

29:12.321 --> 29:14.323
YOU GOTTA HELP ME OUT HERE.

29:14.323 --> 29:16.325
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT MY CHILD.

29:16.325 --> 29:18.527
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO GO THROUGH LIFE

29:18.527 --> 29:21.931
SADDLED
WITH THE NAME "MAYNARD."
 I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

29:21.931 --> 29:24.433
WELL, OF COURSE, YOU DON'T.
YOU'RE VANESSA.

29:24.433 --> 29:26.936
YOU WENT THROUGH LIFE
WITH A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

29:26.936 --> 29:29.799
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE
SUCH A CRACKERJACK PERSONALITY.

29:29.799 --> 29:31.941
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.277
I HAVE A COUPLE ERRANDS TO RUN.
WILL YOU COVER FOR ME?

29:38.277 --> 29:39.778
NO PROBLEM.
 THANKS, GRISELDA.

29:44.553 --> 29:48.117
GRISELDA...

29:48.117 --> 29:51.260
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A TOUGH NAME
TO TAKE OUT ON THE PLAYGROUND.

29:51.260 --> 29:53.192
YEAH.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.924
ACTUALLY, IT WAS.

29:54.924 --> 29:56.866
(sighs)

29:56.866 --> 29:59.428
WE SHOULD TALK.

29:59.428 --> 30:00.930
(elevator bell dings)

30:03.472 --> 30:05.975
HI. I'M, UH, HERE
TO CHECK ON ORSON HODGE.

30:05.975 --> 30:08.978
AN AMBULANCE BROUGHT HIM IN
LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO.

30:08.978 --> 30:10.809
ARE YOU FAMILY?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.042
I'M HIS WIFE.

30:13.042 --> 30:15.244
WELL, HE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

30:15.244 --> 30:16.946
THERE'S NO CONCUSSION,

30:16.946 --> 30:19.949
BUT THE DOCTORS DO WANNA KEEP
HIM HERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

30:19.949 --> 30:22.251
SHOULD I TELL HIM
THAT YOU'RE HERE?

30:29.999 --> 30:33.502
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET HIM REST.

30:37.106 --> 30:40.870
BUT PLEASE
TAKE EXCELLENT CARE OF HIM.

30:40.870 --> 30:42.912
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

30:54.483 --> 30:56.625
GABY, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

30:56.625 --> 30:59.989
ABOUT HOW YOU SNITCHED ON ME
TO CARLOS?

30:59.989 --> 31:02.291
NO, THANKS.
I'M ALL CAUGHT UP ON THAT.

31:04.193 --> 31:06.936
I'M SORRY,
BUT I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE

31:06.936 --> 31:09.498
WHAT CHEATING CAN DO
TO PEOPLE.

31:09.498 --> 31:12.101
LET ME GUESS.
THIS STORY ENDS WITH YOU

31:12.101 --> 31:15.344
THROWING YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
VARSITY JACKET IN THE LAKE?

31:20.349 --> 31:22.451
WHEN I WAS 13,

31:22.451 --> 31:24.954
MY DAD CAUGHT
MY MOM HAVING AN AFFAIR,

31:24.954 --> 31:26.956
AND HE WALKED OUT ON US.

31:26.956 --> 31:29.518
OH.

31:29.518 --> 31:33.192
WE HAD NOTHING, OKAY?
MY MOM WENT CRAZY,

31:33.192 --> 31:35.194
AND I ENDED UP
ON THE STREET.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.196
TO SURVIVE,

31:37.196 --> 31:40.429
I-I HAD TO DO A BUNCH OF STUFF
THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF.

31:40.429 --> 31:42.571
(Gabrielle) Oh, Ellie,
I'm so sorry.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.435
(tires screech)

31:46.435 --> 31:47.937
I had no idea.

31:47.937 --> 31:51.010
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

31:52.381 --> 31:54.543
THAT'S OUR GUY.

31:54.543 --> 31:56.545
(voice breaking)
THE POINT IS,

31:56.545 --> 32:00.249
THE ONE BAD DECISION
CAN MESS UP A LOT OF LIVES,

32:00.249 --> 32:04.093
AND I JUST DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO YOU AND CARLOS

32:04.093 --> 32:06.095
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU GUYS.

32:09.098 --> 32:11.230
(cell phone rings)

32:11.230 --> 32:14.303
(ring)

32:14.303 --> 32:16.065
(ring)

32:16.065 --> 32:17.967
(beep)

32:17.967 --> 32:19.138
YES?

32:19.138 --> 32:20.639
SUPPLIER'S COMING YOUR WAY.

32:20.639 --> 32:25.114
WE'RE GONNA ARREST THEM BOTH,
SO GET OUT OF THERE NOW.

32:25.114 --> 32:28.047
OKAY. BYE.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.218
(beep)

32:29.218 --> 32:32.221
ANYWAY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GET INTO A WHOLE THING.

32:32.221 --> 32:34.723
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY I'M SORRY.

32:34.723 --> 32:37.056
(whispers)
THE COPS ARE COMING. GO.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.027
WHAT?!

32:38.027 --> 32:40.529
(man) POLICE! DROP THE BAG!
DROP THE BAG!

32:40.529 --> 32:43.392
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.
 IT'S A STING.

32:43.392 --> 32:45.464
GO OUT THE BACK NOW.

32:52.201 --> 32:55.074
(handcuffs locking)

32:55.074 --> 32:58.407
ADAM! MOM SAID
YOU WERE COMING TONIGHT.

32:58.407 --> 33:01.410
OH, I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD...
 OH.

33:01.410 --> 33:04.413
SO YOU BETTER BE
ON YOUR "A" GAME.
 OKAY.

33:04.413 --> 33:07.056
AND WE'RE ALL GOING OUT
TO DINNER AFTERWARDS.

33:07.056 --> 33:10.059
ADAM WANTS TO TELL YOU ABOUT
YOUR GRADUATION PRESENT.
 WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

33:10.059 --> 33:12.661
NO, NO, NO. YOU GOTTA WAIT,
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE.

33:12.661 --> 33:15.164
I HOPE
YOUR PASSPORT'S UP-TO-DATE.

33:15.164 --> 33:17.366
(laughs)
 (laughs)

33:19.698 --> 33:21.700
YEAH, NO.
IT'S--IT'S OKAY, ANDREW.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.702
YOU CAN, UH,
YOU CAN JUST--

33:23.702 --> 33:25.704
YOU CAN FINISH IT
IN THE MORNING.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.707
GREAT. SEE YA. BYE.

33:31.180 --> 33:33.182
NEED SOME HELP WITH THAT?

33:33.182 --> 33:35.214
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU LIKED PUZZLES.

33:35.214 --> 33:39.088
HMM. I CAN GIVE IT A SHOT.

33:42.491 --> 33:46.125
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU...

33:46.125 --> 33:47.396
ABOUT LYNETTE.

33:47.396 --> 33:50.529
I'M SORRY I HAD TO CALL
DR. DOLAN, DADDY,

33:50.529 --> 33:52.131
BUT SHE SCARES ME.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.702
YEAH.

33:53.702 --> 33:55.534
YOU SAID THAT BEFORE,

33:55.534 --> 33:57.106
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

33:57.106 --> 33:59.108
THEY'RE GONNA
LET LYNETTE GO SOON,

33:59.108 --> 34:01.110
AND WHEN THEY DO,
YOU GUYS AREN'T

34:01.110 --> 34:05.174
GONNA BE ABLE TO LIVE
IN THE SAME HOUSE ANYMORE.

34:05.174 --> 34:07.176
YOU--YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

34:07.176 --> 34:09.518
SO WHERE IS SHE GONNA LIVE?

34:09.518 --> 34:12.380
LIKE, IN A HOTEL
OR SOMETHING?

34:14.123 --> 34:15.623
SHE LIVES HERE, KAYLA,

34:15.623 --> 34:18.627
WITH ME AND THE BOYS
AND PENNY.

34:18.627 --> 34:20.228
THIS IS HER HOME.

34:20.228 --> 34:22.161
BUT--

34:22.161 --> 34:25.094
BUT DON'T WORRY. WE'RE GONNA
FIND YOU A NICE PLACE TO LIVE.

34:25.094 --> 34:27.436
DADDY,
I DON'T WANNA GO ANYWHERE.

34:27.436 --> 34:30.168
I WANNA STAY HERE WITH YOU.

34:30.168 --> 34:33.802
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE, KAYLA.
I NEED TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

34:33.802 --> 34:36.245
BUT I MADE IT ALL UP.

34:38.447 --> 34:40.549
I LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING.

34:42.311 --> 34:44.183
I BURNED MYSELF.

34:44.183 --> 34:47.516
AND WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT,
KAYLA?

34:47.516 --> 34:49.217
I HATE HER.

34:49.217 --> 34:52.391
AND IT'S SO MUCH BETTER
WHEN IT'S JUST US.

34:58.797 --> 35:02.401
I SEE. AND YOU'LL EXPLAIN
ALL THIS TO THE POLICE

35:02.401 --> 35:04.873
AND DR. DOLAN
AND EVERYBODY, RIGHT?

35:04.873 --> 35:08.106
YES, I PROMISE.
AND THEN I CAN STAY, RIGHT?

35:10.209 --> 35:12.341
NO, SWEETIE. NO.

35:12.341 --> 35:15.384
WHAT YOU DID WAS HORRIBLE,

35:15.384 --> 35:17.586
AND I CAN'T TRUST YOU
ANYMORE.

35:17.586 --> 35:21.250
THEN I'M GONNA KEEP LYING
TO EVERYBODY.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.252
YOU DON'T WANT THAT,
DO YOU?

35:29.498 --> 35:32.301
DID YOU GET ALL THAT,
DR. DOLAN?

35:35.664 --> 35:39.508
(playing classical music)

35:44.142 --> 35:45.244
(piece ends)

35:45.244 --> 35:47.246
(cheering)

35:47.246 --> 35:50.849
(audience murmuring)

35:50.849 --> 35:54.323
I'M GONNA GO STRETCH MY LEGS
AND CHECK MY SERVICE REAL QUICK.

35:54.323 --> 35:56.625
OKAY, BUT INTERMISSION'S
ONLY TEN MINUTES.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.527
YEAH.

35:58.527 --> 36:01.530
(indistinct conversations)

36:08.166 --> 36:11.240
EXCUSE ME.
COULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

36:11.240 --> 36:14.243
WHAT'S UP?
 NAIL IN MY TIRE.
I GOTTA CHANGE IT NOW

36:14.243 --> 36:16.705
'CAUSE I NEED TO LEAVE
AFTER MY DAUGHTER'S SOLO.

36:16.705 --> 36:19.408
I'M--I'M CATCHING A RED-EYE.
 YEAH, SURE. I CAN HELP.

36:19.408 --> 36:22.251
OH, THANKS.
I'M RIGHT OVER HERE.

36:22.251 --> 36:24.413
WOW,
THIS THING'S REALLY FLAT.

36:24.413 --> 36:26.615
USUALLY WITH A NAIL,
YOU GET A SLOW LEAK.

36:26.615 --> 36:29.318
YEAH. I'M LUCKY
I EVEN MADE IT HERE.

36:29.318 --> 36:30.619
WELL, I GOT THIS.

36:30.619 --> 36:33.362
YOU GRAB THE SPARE.

36:33.362 --> 36:35.664
MY DAUGHTER'S THE ONE
THAT PLAYS THE CELLO.

36:35.664 --> 36:37.666
WHICH ONE IS YOUR DAUGHTER?

36:37.666 --> 36:40.369
THAT'S THE OTHER THING
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH.

36:42.831 --> 36:44.333
(clank)

36:44.333 --> 36:47.776
(murmuring)

37:05.594 --> 37:06.955
OH, HONEY,

37:06.955 --> 37:10.228
CAN YOU GET ALL MY TOILETRIES
OUT OF THE BATHROOM?

37:12.801 --> 37:15.634
WHAT ARE THOSE?

37:15.634 --> 37:18.607
WELL, IT'S CUTE, AREN'T THEY?
IT'S A HOSPITAL TRADITION.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.941
(lowers voice)
GET THEM OUT OF HERE NOW.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.374
WHY?
 (normal voice)
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND

37:25.374 --> 37:26.715
IS TERRIFIED OF BALLOONS.

37:26.715 --> 37:29.818
HE WAS ONCE MOLESTED
BY A CLOWN.

37:29.818 --> 37:32.821
OH, MY GOSH.
 (Mike) OH, I GOT IT.

37:35.824 --> 37:36.825
(gasps)

37:36.825 --> 37:38.787
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:38.787 --> 37:41.730
I'M SORRY, SIR.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE CLOWN.

37:43.962 --> 37:47.666
WHY DOES THAT SAY "CONNER"?
 IS THAT WHAT IT SAID?

37:47.666 --> 37:50.339
WE HAD "MAYNARD" ONES
PRINTED UP,

37:50.339 --> 37:52.571
BUT MRS. DELFINO...
 SHH!

37:52.571 --> 37:54.343
WENT TO THE RECORDS OFFICE...

37:54.343 --> 37:58.407
SUSAN... WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:58.407 --> 37:59.778
WELL...

37:59.778 --> 38:02.751
I HATE THE NAME "MAYNARD."

38:02.751 --> 38:04.753
REALLY? I LIKE IT--
 GET OUT.

38:04.753 --> 38:06.385
OH.

38:08.657 --> 38:11.420
I'M SORRY. I...

38:11.420 --> 38:15.293
I JUST WANT OUR KID
TO HAVE A GREAT NAME.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.568
I DON'T THINK "MAYNARD"
IS GREAT.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.976
YOU WANNA KNOW WHATISGREAT?
 (fusses)

38:27.976 --> 38:30.879
MY GRANDFATHER...

38:30.879 --> 38:34.443
STARTED THE FIRST INTEGRATED
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN TENNESSEE.

38:34.443 --> 38:36.845
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE IS GREAT?

38:36.845 --> 38:38.847
WHEN MY DAD WENT TO PRISON,

38:38.847 --> 38:41.790
THE STATE WANTED
TO PUT ME IN THE SYSTEM.

38:41.790 --> 38:43.792
MY GRANDFATHER
WOULDN'T LET 'EM.

38:43.792 --> 38:45.794
HE TOOK IN MY MOM AND ME

38:45.794 --> 38:47.796
AND SACRIFICED EVERYTHING

38:47.796 --> 38:50.429
JUST TO MAKE SURE
WE HAD A GREAT LIFE.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.363
WOW.

38:54.363 --> 38:56.365
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

38:56.365 --> 39:00.409
SUSAN, I DON'T WANT TO
JUST GIVE OUR SON A NAME.

39:00.409 --> 39:05.974
I WANT TO GIVE HIM
SOMEONE TO LIVE UP TO.

39:05.974 --> 39:07.376
MM.

39:15.424 --> 39:17.456
MAYNARD.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.489
LET'S HOPE HE'S WORTHY.

39:20.489 --> 39:25.494
(chuckles)
WELL, THAT PART'S UP TO US.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.901
WELL,
THAT'S ALL OF HER THINGS.

39:32.901 --> 39:36.975
WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING, HMM?

39:36.975 --> 39:38.977
WE FOUND A HOTEL WITH A POOL
FOR TONIGHT.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.910
MAYBE YOU AND GRANDPA
CAN GO SWIMMING.

39:48.557 --> 39:51.560
SHEILA, CAN I TALK TO HER
FOR A SEC?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.492
(door opens)

39:53.492 --> 39:56.765
HONEY,
I KNOW THIS IS HARD ON YOU.

39:56.765 --> 39:59.968
(door shuts)
 BUT I'M GONNA COME VISIT YOU
AT GRANDPA AND GRANDMA'S

39:59.968 --> 40:01.470
ALL THE TIME.

40:01.470 --> 40:04.172
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S GOOD-BYE FOREVER.

40:10.739 --> 40:13.482
KAYLA...

40:13.482 --> 40:15.944
I'M SORRY
HOW EVERYTHING TURNED OUT.

40:15.944 --> 40:19.548
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

40:22.821 --> 40:26.054
OKAY, THEN.

40:28.457 --> 40:30.098
I LOVE YOU, BABY.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.732
HAVE A SAFE TRIP.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.042
(engine starts)

40:50.719 --> 40:54.182
DADDY! I'M SORRY!

40:54.182 --> 40:57.486
(crying)
DADDY, I'M SORRY! PLEASE!

40:57.486 --> 41:01.129
DADDY! PLEASE!

41:15.103 --> 41:17.245
WHAT'S IN A NAME?

41:17.245 --> 41:21.149
DO THE LABELS
WE ATTACH TO PEOPLE

41:21.149 --> 41:25.984
TELL US EVERYTHING
WE NEED TO KNOW?

41:25.984 --> 41:28.617
IF WE SAY SHE'S JUST A CHILD,

41:28.617 --> 41:32.020
DOES THIS MEAN
SHE'S TRULY INNOCENT?

41:33.622 --> 41:39.497
DOES CALLING HER A DRUG DEALER
PROVE SHE'S PURELY EVIL?

41:42.500 --> 41:44.903
WILL A MAN KNOWN AS "PREACHER"

41:44.903 --> 41:48.637
ALWAYS PRACTICE
WHAT HE PREACHES?

41:50.579 --> 41:53.281
CAN A MAN BRANDED A VILLAIN

41:53.281 --> 41:57.946
POSSESS
THE QUALITIES OF A HERO?

41:57.946 --> 41:59.648
THE TRUTH IS,

41:59.648 --> 42:04.152
A NAME CAN NEVER REALLY
TELL YOU WHO SOMEONE IS...

42:13.531 --> 42:15.233
WHO ARE YOU?

42:15.233 --> 42:19.768
ANY MORE THAN IT CAN TELL YOU
WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.

42:19.768 --> 42:22.571
I'M WAYNE DAVIS...

42:22.571 --> 42:23.572
(clatter)

42:23.572 --> 42:26.575
AND WE'RE ABOUT
TO HAVE SOME FUN.
