According to Jim...

00:03.169 --> 00:05.270
We got a free
trip to Vegas.

00:05.304 --> 00:07.306
I've been
keeping in touch
with Jim's sister.

00:07.339 --> 00:08.841
Roxanne?

00:08.874 --> 00:11.477
Yeah. I've been trying
and trying to figure out a way
to get them talking again.

00:11.509 --> 00:13.746
Well, a year ago,
she moved to Vegas.

00:13.778 --> 00:16.047
Roxanne is not good.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.417
You've seen how
she uses people.

00:17.449 --> 00:19.152
She doesn't even
think twice about it.

00:19.184 --> 00:20.786
I know, honey.
I know it's been
that way in the past.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.120
People do change.

00:22.153 --> 00:23.556
My sister does not change.

00:23.588 --> 00:26.525
Oh, really?
You know that guy Rick?
He's out of her life.

00:26.559 --> 00:29.295
She said that the last time.
She always says that.

00:29.327 --> 00:31.496
Then the guy
running the Tilt-A-Whirl
takes off his shirt

00:31.530 --> 00:33.066
and she falls in love
all over again.

00:33.098 --> 00:35.134
When are you gonna
start at the salon?

00:35.167 --> 00:36.768
Well, soon, I hope.

00:36.801 --> 00:39.238
I just got to
raise $2,000.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.508
Somehow.

00:47.479 --> 00:49.448
Roxanne. Roxanne.

00:49.481 --> 00:52.417
What're you doing here?
I thought you didn't have
the money to do this?

00:52.451 --> 00:55.155
I got the money
from my new boyfriend.

of Siegfried and Roy's

01:40.399 --> 01:42.268
You get lost
in their closet, too?

01:43.936 --> 01:45.738
What's with
the clothes?

01:45.771 --> 01:50.575

my new girlfriend, Roxanne.

Yeah, Andy,
I gotta talk to you.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.518
Oh, Jim, I know what you're
gonna say and don't worry.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.753
The Andy-man
can handle himself.

02:00.786 --> 02:02.222
You gotta dump her.

02:03.489 --> 02:04.524

02:04.557 --> 02:05.924
Andy, she is trouble.

Oh, Jim!

02:05.957 --> 02:07.926
Honest to God.

I know you think
you know her,
but you don't.

02:10.527 --> 02:13.231
She will chew you up
and spit you out.

02:13.264 --> 02:15.467
She's done it
to me all my life.

02:15.501 --> 02:18.538
And if she's done it to me,
can you imagine what she can
do to a guy like you?

02:19.671 --> 02:20.907
What kind of guy
is that, Jim?

02:20.939 --> 02:23.909
You know, nice,
sweet, simple.

02:23.943 --> 02:25.378
Are you calling
me a patsy?

02:25.411 --> 02:28.614
No, not at all...
Yes, a patsy.

02:28.646 --> 02:31.783
Oh, really?
Okay, well, that's it!

02:31.817 --> 02:34.687
Thanks a million
for your great advice,
but I don't need it.

you a little grief here.

Believe me,
there's going to
be a ton of grief.

Okay, well,
why don't you just stay
out of it, fathead?

02:41.659 --> 02:43.295

that come from?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.831
From the patsy,
fathead.

I gotta finish packing.

Look, Andy's going to
be here any minute.

11:43.835 --> 11:46.471
Oh. Well, that's
kind of weird,
because he's...

11:46.504 --> 11:49.307
He's supposed to do
a demonstration with me
this afternoon.

11:49.341 --> 11:52.878
Oh. Well, I was gonna
go first and then
he's gonna meet me.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.346
Oh. Didn't you just say
he was going to pick you up?

11:55.379 --> 11:57.349
Oh, hey, we had
a couple of plans.

11:57.381 --> 12:00.452
I don't know which one
we really landed on.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.466
You think I know
everybody that honks
their horn in this town?

12:17.903 --> 12:19.971
You're dumping Andy,
aren't you?

12:20.004 --> 12:22.073
I wouldn't
call it dumping.

12:22.106 --> 12:24.275
I'm just leaving
with another guy.

12:27.412 --> 12:30.816
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew that as soon as
I let my guard down,

12:30.849 --> 12:34.386
you'd slip back to
who you are and you'd
run off with some loser.

12:34.418 --> 12:36.254
Hey, Rick is not a loser.

12:36.288 --> 12:39.358
Why did you marry Andy
in the first place?

12:39.390 --> 12:43.795
I was kind of drunk,
then he won me
that teddy bear,

12:43.828 --> 12:45.830
and then we had
a really big steak.

12:47.899 --> 12:50.802
It just felt right.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.906
He thinks you guys are
going to spend the rest
of your lives together.

Hey, look,
this isn't my fault!

the whole story.

be with Rick,

exactly what you're doing.

Could you tell him?
See, we're not
really that close.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.600
You're his wife!

13:22.634 --> 13:27.105
Well, I guess he'll
find out when he comes
home for dinner tonight.

13:27.138 --> 13:29.041

I'll send you a postcard
when we get settled...

want anything from you.

you stay away from me

from my family.

what you want.

me to say and I have
a problem with the line,
