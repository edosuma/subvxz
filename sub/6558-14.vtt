WEBVTT

00:52.053 --> 00:53.095
Shh!

01:24.293 --> 01:25.503
What's that?

01:32.343 --> 01:34.971
The ghost of Red Beard!

01:48.943 --> 01:54.156
Listen: "Coast Guard baffled as
third freighter raided within a week."

01:54.365 --> 01:57.159
"C.L. Magnus, owner of shipping
line...

01:57.368 --> 02:01.706
claims it's the ghost of Red Beard
the pirate seeking revenge."

02:02.039 --> 02:06.669
Like, I'm sure glad he's not seeking
my superduper sandwich!

02:07.837 --> 02:09.463
Yeah! Yeah!

02:10.006 --> 02:13.217
Lucky for him. He'd probably
get indigestion.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.555
Paw please, Scooby.

02:20.224 --> 02:24.145
Now, that's what I call
handy bite-size!

02:30.609 --> 02:32.737
Delicious!

02:34.071 --> 02:35.740
What happened?

02:36.324 --> 02:38.034
Poor Mr. Magnus!

02:38.242 --> 02:43.080
First he's going out of business,
now this ghost pirate shows up.

02:43.289 --> 02:47.543
Why would a ghost pirate want revenge
on a nice man like Mr. Magnus?

02:47.752 --> 02:51.922
I don't know. But maybe we can
help him solve this mystery.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.008
Let's go see him!

03:01.932 --> 03:06.228
- This must be the apartment.
- "Penthouse, C.L. Magnus."

03:08.731 --> 03:10.274
Yes?

03:10.441 --> 03:13.944
Excuse us, but we'd like to talk
to Mr. Magnus.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.782
I'm afraid not. He's not
to be disturbed.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.284
Well!

03:20.451 --> 03:23.788
That slams the door closed
on this ghost mystery!

03:23.954 --> 03:27.666
If Mr. Magnus knew we were here to help,
he'd see us.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.628
Maybe we still can. I've got an idea.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.883
- Is everybody all set?
- Okay!

03:37.802 --> 03:39.261
Yes?

03:39.470 --> 03:40.805
Room service!

03:41.055 --> 03:44.392
- Breakfast is served!
- At 11:00 at night?

03:44.683 --> 03:48.646
Sure, so you don't have to get up
in the morning to eat!

03:51.732 --> 03:53.401
What's going on in here?

03:53.609 --> 03:56.070
Do you believe we're here to help?

03:56.237 --> 03:59.448
- Like Good Samaritan Joes!
- Yeah, yeah!

04:00.991 --> 04:04.495
So you see,
it was over 300 years ago...

04:04.703 --> 04:08.958
that Red Beard the pirate
was the terror of the seven seas.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.961
When my ancestors brought him
to justice...

04:12.169 --> 04:15.172
he vowed to return
and avenge himself.

04:15.381 --> 04:19.427
Now that he has, I'm afraid nothing
can be done to stop him.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.433
I'm not so sure, Mr. Magnus.
Ghosts are our specialty.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.978
And I have a plan
that I think will work.

04:35.651 --> 04:39.697
If Red Beard sticks to a
schedule, he should strike tonight!

04:39.905 --> 04:43.701
Yeah! And we are going to
be there first, and fool him.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.291
There's the Magnus freighter,
right on schedule.

04:50.499 --> 04:54.545
Good. Now keep your eyes peeled
for a mysterious fog bank!

04:54.837 --> 04:57.756
That's where we'll find
Red Beard's ghost!

04:57.965 --> 05:00.676
You can stop looking,
it's right ahead!

05:00.968 --> 05:05.639
- Let's put Operation Decoy to work!
- I'II switch on the tape recorder.

05:08.184 --> 05:10.478
Now head into the fog bank, Shaggy.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.064
Let's hope that ghost
thinks we're the freighter!

05:14.690 --> 05:16.650
It sure is creepy in here.

05:16.942 --> 05:21.071
Like, the fog is so thick,
you can cut it with a knife.

05:25.576 --> 05:28.329
Scooby-Doo!

05:30.164 --> 05:31.999
Wow! Look!

05:37.379 --> 05:39.590
The ghost ship!

05:44.637 --> 05:48.224
Our plan worked too well!
It's going to ram us!

05:48.432 --> 05:52.394
- Quick, full-speed reverse!
- Like, double full-speed reverse!

05:55.648 --> 05:56.899
Start paddling!

05:57.066 --> 06:00.653
I'm paddling! But I'm not
getting anywhere!

06:00.819 --> 06:03.197
- Me, neither!
- Hang on!

06:05.824 --> 06:07.535
We've been cut in half.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.537
- Now what'll we do?
- Sink!

06:10.329 --> 06:11.664
Oh, my hairdo!

06:14.041 --> 06:16.544
Scooby-Doo! Where are you?

06:17.461 --> 06:20.839
Hey! Come on, let's get out
of this water.

06:21.006 --> 06:25.177
And there's only one place to go.
The ghost ship!

06:25.427 --> 06:26.845
Ghost ship?

06:27.638 --> 06:28.806
Oh, boy!

06:31.058 --> 06:33.269
One more...

06:33.477 --> 06:35.020
tug!

06:36.522 --> 06:39.858
Well, we're aboard this creaking,
creepy craft.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.028
Like, let's hope the others
made it too.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.657
I hope so.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.702
Do you see any ghosts?

06:49.868 --> 06:53.831
No, this spooky
old ship looks deserted to me.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.710
If I know Shag and Scoob,
they're already aboard.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.044
Let's find them.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.881
Yeah, and maybe we can find
some clues as well.

07:04.717 --> 07:07.303
This must be Red Beard's cabin,
Scoob.

07:07.595 --> 07:13.601
And look at that kooky picture.
That must be Red Beard, himself!

07:23.611 --> 07:25.571
Yipe! Help!

07:29.575 --> 07:31.535
Zoinks! It's him!

07:42.755 --> 07:45.090
An unfriendly ghost sword!

07:45.299 --> 07:47.092
Zoinks!

07:53.057 --> 07:54.642
Yipe!

07:58.812 --> 08:00.189
That was close!

08:00.397 --> 08:01.774
Yeah!

08:02.149 --> 08:03.942
Now, let's figure how to...

08:04.109 --> 08:07.696
get out of here!

08:11.659 --> 08:15.746
One, two, three ghosts!

08:15.954 --> 08:19.875
Oh! Oh!

08:20.042 --> 08:23.420
For a ghost ship, there sure aren't
many ghosts.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.173
Maybe they're haunting
for a new house.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.842
Or out with a couple of old
"ghoul friends."

08:33.430 --> 08:35.766
Our jokes weren't that funny, Freddy!

08:35.974 --> 08:38.394
- I didn't laugh!
- Look!

08:40.104 --> 08:41.230
Red Beard!

08:41.647 --> 08:44.817
Come on, let's follow him,
but not too close.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.987
- He's gone!
- Maybe he went in that door.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.907
Well, let's go take a look. Come on!

08:53.283 --> 08:55.911
He's not in here, that's for sure.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.498
Thank goodness. This ghost ship
is giving me the chills!

08:59.707 --> 09:04.336
It's not the ship that's giving you
chills. It's this dry ice.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.423
What's dry ice doing on a ghost ship?

09:07.631 --> 09:11.218
I don't know, but I think we've
found a clue!

09:11.427 --> 09:12.803
The door!

09:14.179 --> 09:15.305
We're locked in!

09:18.434 --> 09:20.227
It's him! Red Beard!

09:28.777 --> 09:32.239
Stop your sniveling, or I'll
make you walk the plank!

09:34.950 --> 09:38.036
What are you gonna do with us,
Your Ghostliness?

09:40.873 --> 09:45.252
But if you were good for anything,
I'd spare you.

09:45.461 --> 09:47.421
- We're good cooks!
- Huh?

09:48.964 --> 09:53.135
Good cooks, eh?
Well, get up and fix me some dinner!

09:53.427 --> 09:57.931
And remember, it better be good,
or...

09:59.016 --> 10:02.144
Aye, aye, sir! Or...

10:04.480 --> 10:06.690
Well, the seawater's boiling.

10:06.899 --> 10:09.943
I wonder what ghosts like in
their stew, Scoob.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.528
Chains?

10:11.695 --> 10:14.865
Chains! Yeah! Ghosts like chains!

10:15.073 --> 10:18.494
And, oh, yeah, some ashes
from the stove!

10:19.661 --> 10:22.915
- You know, this could be real good!
- Yeah, yeah!

10:23.165 --> 10:25.375
Now, what else?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.420
Cobwebs?

10:28.670 --> 10:33.008
Cobwebs! Delightful!
Why didn't I think of that?

10:34.426 --> 10:37.179
Wow! Now, did we forget anything?

10:37.346 --> 10:38.388
Soap!

10:38.597 --> 10:42.184
Soap? I hardly use it myself,
but why not?

10:42.518 --> 10:46.104
I sure hope old Red Beard
likes ghost pirate stew!

10:46.438 --> 10:47.773
Me too!

10:49.191 --> 10:51.860
Ghost pirate stew, eh?

10:52.444 --> 10:53.946
You eat it!

10:55.989 --> 10:57.991
But we aren't hungry.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.493
Eat it!

11:03.121 --> 11:04.331
Bubbles?

11:06.583 --> 11:09.711
Let's bubble our way out of here!

11:10.504 --> 11:12.297
Hey! Stop that!

11:12.464 --> 11:13.799
Come on, run!

11:21.890 --> 11:25.811
Here comes two of them.
And we gotta lose them!

11:26.228 --> 11:29.648
And the only way to lose them
is to fool them!

11:30.107 --> 11:32.860
- First, a paper pirate hat!
- Pirate hat?

11:33.235 --> 11:37.739
And next, my super Shaggy imitation
of Red Beard.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.829
They went thattaway!

11:45.664 --> 11:48.750
Get going, you swabs!

11:50.961 --> 11:53.797
They thought I was Red Beard!

12:00.846 --> 12:03.682
Yipes! It's him again!

12:07.769 --> 12:11.523
- They'll never find us under here.
- I hope!

12:12.316 --> 12:15.694
Only trouble is,
I can't see Where we're going!

12:18.989 --> 12:20.657
Going down!

12:23.493 --> 12:27.497
Oh, boy, off of one tub
and into another.

12:27.706 --> 12:28.790
Shaggy!

12:28.999 --> 12:31.919
- Scooby, your voice has changed.
- Up here!

12:32.127 --> 12:34.212
- Velma!
- We're locked in!

12:34.379 --> 12:37.966
Don't worry, we'll save you, I think.

12:38.175 --> 12:42.095
Come on, Scoob!
Follow that ghost ship!

12:47.059 --> 12:49.811
So this is where they've been hiding!

12:50.020 --> 12:52.064
A secret cove at Skull Island.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.983
Why does a ghost ship
need a secret cove?

12:55.192 --> 12:56.318
I don't know.

12:56.485 --> 12:59.571
This mystery gets more mysterious
by the minute!

12:59.821 --> 13:03.325
There they go! Keep paddling, Scooby!

13:05.410 --> 13:06.620
Yipes!

13:08.455 --> 13:10.374
Ooh-wee.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.002
Keep paddling! Quit clowning around!

13:24.596 --> 13:28.600
Soon you shall join my crew!

13:30.560 --> 13:32.437
What did he mean by that?

13:32.646 --> 13:36.358
I guess he means we're going
to be ghosts before he's through!

13:36.566 --> 13:40.070
I hate to spoil his fun,
but we're gonna bust out of here!

13:40.278 --> 13:43.865
But how? The key for the lock
is way over there!

13:44.157 --> 13:49.496
Like this. A pole from this straw,
and gum is going to get us the key!

13:51.623 --> 13:55.627
It won't quite reach. One more
piece of straw ought to do it.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.087
Got it!

13:58.463 --> 14:00.966
Let's get out of these creepy caves!

14:01.133 --> 14:05.387
You said it! That seagoing spook
might show up any minute!

14:07.305 --> 14:10.976
- Four tunnels. Which one shall we take?
- Mo!

14:11.184 --> 14:15.814
- Mo?
- Sure! Eenie, meenie, minie, mo!

14:15.981 --> 14:17.024
Mo it is!

14:18.984 --> 14:20.152
Hi, Velma.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.654
Shaggy! Scooby!

14:22.904 --> 14:24.906
Hey, Shag, I see you found us!

14:25.115 --> 14:27.993
Yeah, now like, let's all get lost!

14:28.201 --> 14:32.456
First, get rid of that ridiculous
pirate hat you're wearing.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.208
Hey! Wait a minute!
Let me see that hat!

14:36.209 --> 14:38.295
This is a ship's manifest!

14:38.503 --> 14:43.091
I've heard of man-o-war,
but I've never heard of man-o-fest!

14:43.717 --> 14:46.845
It's a list of the cargo the freighter
was carrying...

14:47.054 --> 14:49.306
and how much the cargo was worth.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.682
Is that a clue?

14:50.932 --> 14:55.520
You bet! Look at the date!
That ship won't sail until tomorrow!

14:55.729 --> 14:58.940
- How would a ghost get this?
- Why would he want it?

14:59.316 --> 15:03.570
I have a hunch a little investigation
will give us the answer.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.155
Come on!

15:06.031 --> 15:08.366
I was right! Truck tire tracks!

15:08.575 --> 15:11.036
Now we know the ghost drives a truck.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.330
Let's see where they go.

15:13.830 --> 15:18.085
- Okay, Scooby, follow the tire tracks.
- Yeah, yeah!

15:18.293 --> 15:19.878
Well, lead on.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.677
- A pirate's chest!
- It must be stuffed full of that truck...

15:27.886 --> 15:30.388
because that's where
the tracks end.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.975
If so, this creepy cave is creepier
than I thought!

15:34.226 --> 15:38.563
Come on, let's find out what's
in the chest. Open it up!

15:40.565 --> 15:43.693
What's the password, you swabs?

15:46.196 --> 15:48.573
Zoinks! A talking pirate skull!

15:48.907 --> 15:52.994
Everybody relax, it's only
a mini-microphone and speaker.

15:53.161 --> 15:58.083
- What's it mean by ”give the password"?
- I don't know, let's give it a try.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.086
"Sixteen men on a pirate's chest"?

16:01.294 --> 16:04.339
Let's see. "Yo-ho-ho,
blow the man down"?

16:04.548 --> 16:09.427
How about, "Yum, yum, yum,
and a liverwurst é la mode"?

16:10.804 --> 16:12.639
Wow! What a password!

16:12.931 --> 16:16.017
It worked this voice-activated
secret entrance!

16:16.226 --> 16:22.232
- The tire tracks go right inside!
- And so are we. Come on!

16:23.150 --> 16:27.028
So this is where Red Beard stores
his stolen cargo.

16:30.157 --> 16:34.286
And this is where Red Beard
will keep his secret forever!

16:34.452 --> 16:37.789
Zoinks! It's that goony ghost again!
Let's get-

16:38.123 --> 16:41.126
Lower the iron door, and after them!

16:48.008 --> 16:50.010
Quick! Behind the crates!

16:55.807 --> 16:59.519
Zoinks! It's the gay blade
of the ghost set again!

17:06.776 --> 17:10.655
Yoinks! It's trying to shish kebab us,
Scoob!

17:12.449 --> 17:13.658
Scooby snacks!

17:14.534 --> 17:17.704
Scooby snacks! Boxes of them!

17:21.791 --> 17:24.085
Scooby-Doo!

17:24.336 --> 17:26.379
If I only had a sword!

17:28.548 --> 17:31.092
This nightstick should do it!

17:31.509 --> 17:33.553
En garde!

17:34.179 --> 17:37.390
- Wow! It's liverwurst!
- Liverwurst!

17:47.108 --> 17:48.443
Delicious!

17:48.818 --> 17:51.321
Gangway!

17:53.114 --> 17:55.242
Behind that barrel!

17:59.996 --> 18:02.165
Down the hatch!

18:08.129 --> 18:10.632
I should have known! Oil!

18:15.679 --> 18:17.889
Make your shots count.

18:18.890 --> 18:22.102
I hope this works on ghosts!

18:23.770 --> 18:24.854
Bull's-eye!

18:29.484 --> 18:32.612
Two down! I mean up!
And one Red Beard to go!

18:33.113 --> 18:37.492
Now I'll make a pirate's stew
out of you!

18:38.493 --> 18:42.622
- Hands up and stand back, partner!
- An eggbeater?

18:42.872 --> 18:44.374
Yeah, an eggbeater!

18:55.385 --> 19:00.974
Hey! Let's ride! He'll never catch us
on this automatic pogo stick!

19:02.892 --> 19:08.106
Pogo stick? This is a jackhammer!

19:13.987 --> 19:15.989
- Shaggy!
- Scooby!

19:16.197 --> 19:17.532
Look out!

19:32.922 --> 19:34.758
Look out! The tires!

19:38.303 --> 19:40.055
We did it, Scooby!

19:40.263 --> 19:41.723
Scooby-Doo!

19:47.062 --> 19:48.521
Nice going, kids.

19:48.730 --> 19:52.942
Uncovering these phonies
and their ship is a job well done!

19:53.151 --> 19:59.157
Thanks. Now, let's see whose glowing
phosphorous face Red Beard really is!

19:59.657 --> 20:01.368
Mr. Magnus!

20:01.534 --> 20:04.454
I thought like, the butler
always did it!

20:04.621 --> 20:08.166
- But who are the other two?
- Hired henchmen, I guess.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.794
Mr. Magnus was
about to lose his business...

20:11.002 --> 20:13.546
unless he came up with
a lot of money!

20:13.713 --> 20:17.884
What easier way than
to hijack your ships and sell the cargo?

20:18.093 --> 20:20.220
They had a neat ghost setup.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.264
Down to the ghost sword
operated by wires.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.059
Where did that mysterious fog
come from?

20:26.267 --> 20:29.854
- Simple! Like, dry ice!
- Dry ice?

20:30.063 --> 20:33.483
Sure. All they did was drop dry ice
over the side of the ship.

20:33.608 --> 20:39.364
And when dry ice mixes with water,
it makes a real spooky fog.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.075
- Show them, Scooby.
- Right!

20:55.213 --> 20:57.841
Scooby-Doo!

21:56.483 --> 21:57.525
Shh!
